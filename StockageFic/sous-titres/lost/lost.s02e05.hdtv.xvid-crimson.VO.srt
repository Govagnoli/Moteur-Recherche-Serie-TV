1
00:00:01,031 --> 00:00:02,599
Previously on "Lost"...

2
00:00:17,158 --> 00:00:19,633
- Who are you?
- We crashed here.

3
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:21,477
Flight 815?

4
00:00:21,851 --> 00:00:23,418
You were in the back?

5
00:00:25,195 --> 00:00:26,763
Back up!

6
00:00:27,323 --> 00:00:28,938
Coming up!

7
00:00:30,343 --> 00:00:31,671
Everything is cool.

8
00:00:31,763 --> 00:00:34,347
We had a talk, and they believe
we were on the plane, too.

9
00:00:34,377 --> 00:00:37,044
I guess we can all
sue Oceanic together.

10
00:00:37,091 --> 00:00:38,801
How many of you survived?

11
00:00:38,941 --> 00:00:40,454
23 of us.

12
00:00:48,186 --> 00:00:50,279
Thought you said
there were 23 of you.

13
00:00:51,589 --> 00:00:53,105
There were.

14
00:01:16,322 --> 00:01:17,986
It's been four days.

15
00:01:21,354 --> 00:01:23,113
You know, that's not that long.

16
00:01:23,253 --> 00:01:25,933
They said it could take up to
two weeks to find a current.

17
00:01:25,963 --> 00:01:29,463
I mean, Michael knew what he was doing.
I doubt anything would have...

18
00:01:31,508 --> 00:01:34,683
What? What?

19
00:01:38,676 --> 00:01:40,533
Sun, what's wrong?

20
00:01:41,418 --> 00:01:44,228
My wedding ring. It's gone.

21
00:02:03,721 --> 00:02:06,021
  

22
00:02:06,237 --> 00:02:07,614
  

23
00:02:12,621 --> 00:02:15,193
  

24
00:02:15,518 --> 00:02:16,942
  

25
00:02:17,036 --> 00:02:19,606
  

26
00:02:20,074 --> 00:02:23,697
  

27
00:02:24,682 --> 00:02:26,773
  

28
00:02:29,297 --> 00:02:31,485
  

29
00:02:31,626 --> 00:02:34,006
  

30
00:02:34,191 --> 00:02:35,941
  

31
00:02:37,253 --> 00:02:40,208
  

32
00:02:43,014 --> 00:02:46,111
  

33
00:02:46,205 --> 00:02:48,585
  

34
00:02:48,724 --> 00:02:51,725
  

35
00:02:51,824 --> 00:02:55,250
  

36
00:02:58,390 --> 00:02:59,952
  

37
00:03:00,231 --> 00:03:01,846
  

38
00:03:01,987 --> 00:03:04,079
  

39
00:03:05,436 --> 00:03:08,772
  

40
00:03:09,238 --> 00:03:12,095
  

41
00:03:12,281 --> 00:03:15,092
  

42
00:03:16,401 --> 00:03:17,728
  

43
00:03:18,336 --> 00:03:21,672
  

44
00:03:26,258 --> 00:03:27,351
  

45
00:03:28,357 --> 00:03:29,351
  

46
00:03:30,614 --> 00:03:32,373
  

47
00:03:32,512 --> 00:03:34,730
  

48
00:03:34,825 --> 00:03:36,630
  

49
00:03:37,189 --> 00:03:39,713
  

50
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:43,393
  

51
00:03:44,045 --> 00:03:47,287
  

52
00:03:48,455 --> 00:03:52,460
  

53
00:03:53,068 --> 00:03:57,168
  

54
00:03:58,851 --> 00:04:02,667
  

55
00:04:04,489 --> 00:04:07,155
  

56
00:04:10,282 --> 00:04:11,659
  

57
00:04:12,125 --> 00:04:13,338
  

58
00:04:13,572 --> 00:04:14,612
  

59
00:04:16,391 --> 00:04:18,101
  

60
00:04:18,427 --> 00:04:19,804
  

61
00:04:20,412 --> 00:04:22,599
  

62
00:04:22,738 --> 00:04:24,546
  

63
00:04:28,055 --> 00:04:29,050
  

64
00:04:29,235 --> 00:04:31,949
  

65
00:04:35,179 --> 00:04:36,754
  

66
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:55,690
Hey, man...

67
00:04:57,281 --> 00:04:59,375
It's okay. Sun?

68
00:05:01,107 --> 00:05:03,966
You'll be with her again. Soon.

69
00:05:05,882 --> 00:05:06,731
Okay?

70
00:05:10,157 --> 00:05:14,917
Hey, I think they're trying to
figure out what to do with us.

71
00:05:18,941 --> 00:05:20,891
I think they're
going to eat us.

72
00:05:23,557 --> 00:05:25,842
All right, all of you, get up.

73
00:05:26,058 --> 00:05:27,242
We're moving out.

74
00:05:30,845 --> 00:05:32,037
Moving out where?

75
00:05:32,123 --> 00:05:34,273
You're going to help
us get food and water.

76
00:05:35,292 --> 00:05:37,003
What, we work for you now?

77
00:05:37,095 --> 00:05:40,195
You're going to do it because we
have a long walk ahead of us.

78
00:05:40,703 --> 00:05:42,843
A long walk where?

79
00:05:43,076 --> 00:05:45,842
Back to where you came from.

80
00:06:13,112 --> 00:06:14,106
All clear.

81
00:06:25,411 --> 00:06:28,986
Hey, Mike, think we ought to
stage a prison break here.

82
00:06:29,172 --> 00:06:32,572
Yeah, well, I want to figure out
what the hell is going on over here

83
00:06:32,647 --> 00:06:35,123
before I make any
decisions about anything.

84
00:06:35,215 --> 00:06:36,640
Okay, people, listen up.

85
00:06:38,323 --> 00:06:41,230
We need to gather as much
food and water as we can.

86
00:06:41,368 --> 00:06:42,804
We travel in pairs.

87
00:06:42,886 --> 00:06:45,839
You move as fast as you can,
don't make any noise.

88
00:06:46,446 --> 00:06:48,996
Maybe you could just take
a minute to explain to us

89
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:53,216
what the hell is going on over here
that's got you all so on edge?

90
00:06:53,727 --> 00:06:55,770
You know what?
That's a great idea.

91
00:06:55,861 --> 00:06:58,145
Maybe we can swap
stories on the road.

92
00:06:58,799 --> 00:07:00,666
We're gonna go scout
before we move.

93
00:07:02,493 --> 00:07:04,203
Cindy, go with him.

94
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:10,107
Libby, see what fruit you can gather.
Take him with you.

95
00:07:10,214 --> 00:07:11,877
His name is Michael.

96
00:07:12,871 --> 00:07:15,717
Yeah.  Right. Michael.

97
00:07:16,183 --> 00:07:18,183
- Wait.
- I'll be okay, man. Don't worry.

98
00:07:18,462 --> 00:07:20,212
Bernard and I will
gather the fish.

99
00:07:20,217 --> 00:07:21,257
Fish.

100
00:07:23,111 --> 00:07:26,495
The man knows how to fish.
I'd take him with you if I were you.

101
00:07:26,774 --> 00:07:29,106
Fine. He comes with us, too.

102
00:07:52,461 --> 00:07:53,365
Sun.

103
00:07:55,604 --> 00:07:56,602
You okay?

104
00:07:57,392 --> 00:07:59,324
I lost my wedding ring.

105
00:08:04,986 --> 00:08:06,754
When was the last
time you saw it?

106
00:08:10,073 --> 00:08:11,968
I'm so used to it, I don't...

107
00:08:12,903 --> 00:08:14,135
I don't know.

108
00:08:18,815 --> 00:08:20,669
Well, I lost my
wedding ring once.

109
00:08:22,212 --> 00:08:25,812
It's crazy where you'll look when you
want to find something bad enough.

110
00:08:26,527 --> 00:08:29,528
Went through the garbage
outside the house,

111
00:08:29,715 --> 00:08:31,664
emptied the bags
and everything.

112
00:08:32,412 --> 00:08:35,175
I even took apart the
pipes in my bathroom,

113
00:08:35,268 --> 00:08:38,668
because I was convinced that it had
gone down the drain in the sink.

114
00:08:39,492 --> 00:08:41,298
What  did your wife say?

115
00:08:41,678 --> 00:08:44,529
- Well, she never knew.
- How was that?

116
00:08:44,761 --> 00:08:49,484
I went to a jeweler and I had
a replica made, that's how.

117
00:08:56,783 --> 00:09:01,410
Yeah, now it's just rattling around
in my sock drawer back home.

118
00:09:03,704 --> 00:09:06,273
Um, I can help you look.

119
00:09:07,115 --> 00:09:08,592
No, thanks.

120
00:09:09,527 --> 00:09:11,153
I'm sure it will turn up.

121
00:09:28,501 --> 00:09:30,548
Hey! Hey.

122
00:09:32,418 --> 00:09:34,176
You wanna help us
out over here?

123
00:09:38,201 --> 00:09:39,678
You wanna eat?

124
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,184
Help us.

125
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:52,438
Does it look like
I speak Korean?

126
00:10:14,857 --> 00:10:15,754
Fish.

127
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:26,099
  

128
00:10:26,316 --> 00:10:27,214
  

129
00:10:27,774 --> 00:10:29,084
  

130
00:10:29,833 --> 00:10:32,211
  

131
00:10:32,538 --> 00:10:35,883
   

132
00:10:37,188 --> 00:10:38,943
  

133
00:10:39,175 --> 00:10:41,365
  

134
00:10:42,766 --> 00:10:44,477
  

135
00:10:45,798 --> 00:10:46,649
  

136
00:10:47,209 --> 00:10:52,363
  

137
00:10:52,873 --> 00:10:54,733
  

138
00:10:56,759 --> 00:10:59,454
  

139
00:11:01,091 --> 00:11:02,514
  

140
00:11:02,842 --> 00:11:04,934
  

141
00:11:09,659 --> 00:11:11,513
  

142
00:11:13,384 --> 00:11:14,789
  

143
00:11:19,468 --> 00:11:22,517
  

144
00:11:27,241 --> 00:11:29,904
  

145
00:11:30,186 --> 00:11:32,589
  

146
00:11:33,429 --> 00:11:36,035
  

147
00:11:43,374 --> 00:11:44,321
  

148
00:11:45,723 --> 00:11:47,535
  

149
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:51,547
  

150
00:11:52,793 --> 00:11:54,839
  

151
00:11:55,035 --> 00:11:57,692
  

152
00:12:01,013 --> 00:12:03,746
  

153
00:12:03,914 --> 00:12:06,581
  

154
00:12:09,435 --> 00:12:12,006
- Sorry, Michael.
- Sorry about what?

155
00:12:12,146 --> 00:12:16,018
You know, about throwing you
and your friends into the pit.

156
00:12:16,710 --> 00:12:18,624
- Friends.
- What?

157
00:12:19,411 --> 00:12:21,480
Just never thought
about them like that.

158
00:12:21,593 --> 00:12:23,348
I mean,
I guess one of them's my friend.

159
00:12:23,378 --> 00:12:26,458
- I'm guessing not the redneck.
- Yeah, not the redneck.

160
00:12:27,204 --> 00:12:30,693
I don't think I've ever seen
someone so scared in my life.

161
00:12:31,259 --> 00:12:33,160
And I know about scared.

162
00:12:33,473 --> 00:12:35,901
That why you threw
us in the pit?

163
00:12:36,088 --> 00:12:37,559
'Cause you're scared?

164
00:12:38,072 --> 00:12:39,356
And we've got...

165
00:12:39,866 --> 00:12:41,489
trust issues.

166
00:12:41,994 --> 00:12:42,749
Huh.

167
00:12:44,064 --> 00:12:45,194
How about that?

168
00:12:46,737 --> 00:12:48,524
Where the hell
are all the fruit?

169
00:12:48,911 --> 00:12:50,625
You know,
we picked these trees pretty clean.

170
00:12:50,655 --> 00:12:53,004
Sometimes you can find
them on the ground.

171
00:12:53,174 --> 00:12:54,484
Then why don't you head inland?

172
00:12:54,514 --> 00:12:56,736
That's where all the
fruit is on our side.

173
00:12:57,062 --> 00:12:59,824
- We don't go that way.
- Why?

174
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:05,251
Because that's where
they come from.

175
00:13:16,390 --> 00:13:18,960
For your protection
when we travel.

176
00:13:26,186 --> 00:13:27,640
You made this?

177
00:13:32,554 --> 00:13:34,408
So what's your name anyway?

178
00:13:39,227 --> 00:13:40,777
Mistereko.

179
00:13:41,946 --> 00:13:43,704
Mr. Eko?

180
00:13:45,724 --> 00:13:46,614
Yes.

181
00:13:48,215 --> 00:13:50,299
So what's that, like Mr. Ed?

182
00:13:53,712 --> 00:13:55,312
- Michael-- he just left.
- What?

183
00:13:55,373 --> 00:13:58,573
He just said something,
then he went into the jungle. He's gone.

184
00:13:59,738 --> 00:14:01,637
Let's go. We're leaving now.

185
00:14:01,822 --> 00:14:03,038
What do you mean,
we're leaving?

186
00:14:03,068 --> 00:14:04,693
Your buddy ran off
into the jungle.

187
00:14:04,723 --> 00:14:06,023
Michael-- he just... left.

188
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:12,100
What's he trying to say?
What's he saying?

189
00:14:13,845 --> 00:14:14,655
Walt!

190
00:14:17,254 --> 00:14:18,153
Walt!

191
00:14:18,822 --> 00:14:20,307
Let's go. We're moving out now.
Cindy, water.

192
00:14:20,337 --> 00:14:21,633
Libby, can you carry the radio?

193
00:14:21,663 --> 00:14:23,138
Wait, you have a radio?

194
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:24,983
Does it work?

195
00:14:25,537 --> 00:14:26,554
Can you use it?

196
00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:28,095
Wow, what a great idea.

197
00:14:29,357 --> 00:14:33,050
- You gonna slow us down?
- No. Michael.

198
00:14:33,496 --> 00:14:36,545
We're leaving before he
can tell them where we are.

199
00:14:38,157 --> 00:14:39,368
Michael.

200
00:14:40,467 --> 00:14:42,517
What are we supposed to do,
wait for him?

201
00:14:43,027 --> 00:14:44,882
He ain't coming back
without his kid.

202
00:14:45,442 --> 00:14:48,944
Walt. He ain't coming
back without Walt.

203
00:14:50,069 --> 00:14:52,425
You really think
he's gonna find him?

204
00:14:54,953 --> 00:14:59,103
In case you haven't noticed,
it's every man for himself, Chewie.

205
00:14:59,242 --> 00:15:00,905
Mike's  gotta worry about Mike.

206
00:15:00,997 --> 00:15:03,042
And I gotta worry about me.

207
00:15:05,053 --> 00:15:06,188
Wait.

208
00:15:07,358 --> 00:15:08,496
Please.

209
00:15:32,842 --> 00:15:34,403
You're going the wrong way.

210
00:15:36,509 --> 00:15:38,744
That's where he's going.

211
00:15:39,168 --> 00:15:40,716
Toward them.

212
00:15:46,987 --> 00:15:48,327
What are you doing?

213
00:15:48,786 --> 00:15:50,686
I'm going to help
him find his friend.

214
00:15:53,535 --> 00:15:55,110
We can't wait for you.

215
00:15:57,114 --> 00:15:58,930
I don't expect you to.

216
00:16:08,843 --> 00:16:10,869
All you gotta do is
retrace your steps.

217
00:16:12,535 --> 00:16:14,387
Like, what'd you do yesterday?

218
00:16:15,174 --> 00:16:18,605
I woke up, washed up,
walked with Shannon.

219
00:16:18,699 --> 00:16:20,457
We picked some fruit...

220
00:16:20,597 --> 00:16:22,690
cut it up to feed Vincent,
and then--

221
00:16:22,830 --> 00:16:25,976
Whoa. You fed the dog?

222
00:16:27,745 --> 00:16:28,738
Bingo.

223
00:16:31,273 --> 00:16:33,987
So... Seoul.

224
00:16:35,008 --> 00:16:37,820
Is that in the good
Korea or the bad Korea?

225
00:16:39,128 --> 00:16:40,562
The good one.

226
00:16:46,403 --> 00:16:48,024
Did you go to the olympics?

227
00:16:49,796 --> 00:16:52,271
Hurley, this is ridiculous.

228
00:16:52,697 --> 00:16:54,218
Waiting here for...

229
00:16:56,884 --> 00:16:59,190
the dog did not eat my ring.

230
00:16:59,267 --> 00:17:02,040
Dude, dogs will eat anything.

231
00:17:02,163 --> 00:17:04,637
When I was a kid,
my dog Buster?

232
00:17:04,755 --> 00:17:07,655
I had this drawer where I'd
throw in all my change, right?

233
00:17:07,739 --> 00:17:10,821
And I guess there were some smarties
in there, so, like, the next day,

234
00:17:10,851 --> 00:17:13,852
Buster craps out a
buck 35 in nickels.

235
00:17:22,535 --> 00:17:24,555
Did you ever own a dog?

236
00:17:25,233 --> 00:17:25,925
Yes.

237
00:17:26,757 --> 00:17:30,571
Jin gave me one. A puppy.

238
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:32,565
What was his name?

239
00:17:33,031 --> 00:17:34,551
Bpo bpo.

240
00:17:34,690 --> 00:17:36,018
Bpo bpo.

241
00:17:37,093 --> 00:17:38,422
Does that mean something?

242
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:39,468
Yes.

243
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:41,793
It means "a kiss."

244
00:17:43,026 --> 00:17:44,108
A kiss.

245
00:17:50,033 --> 00:17:51,840
  

246
00:17:53,242 --> 00:17:58,207
  

247
00:17:59,763 --> 00:18:01,029
  

248
00:18:01,167 --> 00:18:02,830
  

249
00:18:02,971 --> 00:18:05,549
  

250
00:18:05,636 --> 00:18:10,808
  

251
00:18:11,396 --> 00:18:14,828
  

252
00:18:17,447 --> 00:18:19,494
  

253
00:18:21,317 --> 00:18:23,650
  

254
00:18:24,565 --> 00:18:28,124
  

255
00:18:28,301 --> 00:18:33,310
  

256
00:18:33,541 --> 00:18:35,110
  

257
00:18:35,576 --> 00:18:40,070
  

258
00:18:55,330 --> 00:18:57,364
  

259
00:18:57,503 --> 00:18:58,903
  

260
00:19:01,044 --> 00:19:04,656
  

261
00:19:05,124 --> 00:19:06,476
  

262
00:19:06,589 --> 00:19:09,707
  

263
00:19:10,169 --> 00:19:12,877
  

264
00:19:14,318 --> 00:19:15,895
  

265
00:19:16,039 --> 00:19:17,259
  

266
00:19:17,464 --> 00:19:22,742
  

267
00:19:23,411 --> 00:19:25,296
  

268
00:19:25,501 --> 00:19:27,111
  

269
00:19:27,195 --> 00:19:30,719
   

270
00:19:31,374 --> 00:19:34,518
  

271
00:19:40,704 --> 00:19:43,538
  

272
00:19:43,702 --> 00:19:45,720
  

273
00:19:46,532 --> 00:19:49,345
  

274
00:20:24,074 --> 00:20:24,849
No.

275
00:20:24,927 --> 00:20:26,471
- Michael.
- Wait. No.

276
00:21:07,274 --> 00:21:08,813
His name was Goodwin.

277
00:21:13,456 --> 00:21:14,561
Others?

278
00:21:31,863 --> 00:21:32,808
Michael?

279
00:21:35,971 --> 00:21:36,707
No.

280
00:21:39,737 --> 00:21:40,873
For your cut.

281
00:21:52,346 --> 00:21:53,340
So you're married?

282
00:21:55,661 --> 00:21:56,496
Your ring.

283
00:21:58,120 --> 00:21:59,932
You have a wife?

284
00:22:01,563 --> 00:22:02,470
Yes.

285
00:22:04,219 --> 00:22:05,452
You?

286
00:22:06,854 --> 00:22:07,932
Worse.

287
00:22:17,329 --> 00:22:20,642
Your wife-- what is her name?

288
00:22:23,234 --> 00:22:24,650
Her name?

289
00:22:25,246 --> 00:22:26,144
Sun.

290
00:22:27,841 --> 00:22:28,965
She was with you?

291
00:22:32,007 --> 00:22:33,192
On the plane?

292
00:23:16,561 --> 00:23:17,459
Bad day?

293
00:23:30,284 --> 00:23:31,324
It's clean.

294
00:23:33,712 --> 00:23:34,718
Thank you.

295
00:23:36,862 --> 00:23:38,020
You mind if I sit?

296
00:23:46,513 --> 00:23:47,708
Did you see me?

297
00:23:48,445 --> 00:23:51,590
Rip apart your garden? No.

298
00:23:56,738 --> 00:23:59,550
Sometimes I wish I had
a garden to tear apart.

299
00:24:02,028 --> 00:24:04,583
I don't think I have
ever seen you angry.

300
00:24:06,628 --> 00:24:09,804
Oh, I used to get angry...

301
00:24:10,284 --> 00:24:11,567
all the time.

302
00:24:12,322 --> 00:24:13,512
Frustrated, too.

303
00:24:14,794 --> 00:24:17,031
So you're not
frustrated anymore?

304
00:24:20,666 --> 00:24:22,298
I'm not lost anymore.

305
00:24:24,944 --> 00:24:27,107
How did you do that?

306
00:24:27,294 --> 00:24:31,592
Same way anything
lost gets found...

307
00:24:33,878 --> 00:24:35,351
I stopped looking.

308
00:25:11,593 --> 00:25:13,045
  

309
00:25:18,261 --> 00:25:20,257
  

310
00:25:20,656 --> 00:25:22,821
  

311
00:25:23,943 --> 00:25:26,995
  

312
00:25:27,553 --> 00:25:28,608
  

313
00:25:32,292 --> 00:25:33,955
  

314
00:25:34,468 --> 00:25:36,473
  

315
00:25:37,058 --> 00:25:39,502
  

316
00:25:47,645 --> 00:25:49,745
  

317
00:25:49,831 --> 00:25:53,822
  

318
00:25:53,928 --> 00:25:56,118
  

319
00:25:56,444 --> 00:25:59,544
  

320
00:26:00,804 --> 00:26:02,526
  

321
00:26:02,611 --> 00:26:04,318
  

322
00:26:08,015 --> 00:26:11,544
  

323
00:26:13,648 --> 00:26:15,905
  

324
00:26:17,943 --> 00:26:19,272
  

325
00:26:19,597 --> 00:26:22,097
  

326
00:26:22,322 --> 00:26:26,591
  

327
00:26:27,456 --> 00:26:30,750
  

328
00:26:30,931 --> 00:26:33,049
  

329
00:26:35,316 --> 00:26:38,237
  

330
00:26:39,354 --> 00:26:41,274
  

331
00:26:43,008 --> 00:26:45,836
  

332
00:26:47,038 --> 00:26:49,096
  

333
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:54,490
  

334
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:00,170
  

335
00:27:00,916 --> 00:27:02,815
  

336
00:27:04,313 --> 00:27:05,358
  

337
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:07,842
  

338
00:27:08,542 --> 00:27:09,631
  

339
00:27:09,796 --> 00:27:11,412
  

340
00:27:12,066 --> 00:27:13,349
  

341
00:27:14,142 --> 00:27:16,435
  

342
00:27:16,602 --> 00:27:17,857
  

343
00:27:18,025 --> 00:27:20,281
  

344
00:27:21,018 --> 00:27:22,635
  

345
00:27:23,010 --> 00:27:25,442
  

346
00:27:26,445 --> 00:27:27,343
  

347
00:27:27,502 --> 00:27:31,296
  

348
00:27:47,291 --> 00:27:48,982
No, not that way. Over here.

349
00:27:55,879 --> 00:27:57,228
Around the heel.

350
00:27:57,832 --> 00:27:59,268
This is fresh.

351
00:28:01,905 --> 00:28:03,666
These tracks.

352
00:28:04,241 --> 00:28:05,320
Michael.

353
00:28:07,264 --> 00:28:09,243
Yes. Michael.

354
00:28:11,173 --> 00:28:13,519
They don't leave tracks.

355
00:28:46,669 --> 00:28:47,744
Shh!

356
00:30:12,867 --> 00:30:14,099
- Michael.
- No.

357
00:30:15,877 --> 00:30:16,952
They don't have him.

358
00:30:26,326 --> 00:30:28,054
They came from that way.

359
00:30:29,488 --> 00:30:32,218
Your friend went that way.

360
00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:35,205
Crossed ahead of them.

361
00:30:35,694 --> 00:30:37,309
Very lucky.

362
00:30:40,353 --> 00:30:44,751
You... go back. I go.

363
00:30:44,832 --> 00:30:46,615
No.

364
00:30:47,339 --> 00:30:49,202
We go together.

365
00:31:01,318 --> 00:31:03,096
  

366
00:31:03,817 --> 00:31:06,089
  

367
00:31:09,946 --> 00:31:12,065
  

368
00:31:12,835 --> 00:31:16,183
  

369
00:31:16,828 --> 00:31:19,176
  

370
00:31:20,260 --> 00:31:21,577
  

371
00:31:22,763 --> 00:31:25,599
  

372
00:31:29,896 --> 00:31:30,840
  

373
00:31:31,542 --> 00:31:34,025
  

374
00:31:33,985 --> 00:31:34,993
  

375
00:31:35,023 --> 00:31:37,833
  

376
00:31:38,370 --> 00:31:40,075
  

377
00:31:44,058 --> 00:31:45,084
  

378
00:31:45,249 --> 00:31:49,353
  

379
00:31:49,422 --> 00:31:50,757
  

380
00:31:50,877 --> 00:31:53,161
  

381
00:31:54,330 --> 00:31:55,722
  

382
00:31:55,752 --> 00:31:57,951
  

383
00:31:58,035 --> 00:32:00,816
  

384
00:32:01,171 --> 00:32:03,221
  

385
00:32:03,683 --> 00:32:07,861
  

386
00:32:16,619 --> 00:32:18,057
  

387
00:32:18,325 --> 00:32:20,901
  

388
00:32:38,595 --> 00:32:39,433
Hey.

389
00:32:40,775 --> 00:32:41,864
Hello.

390
00:32:44,732 --> 00:32:45,867
It's pretty.

391
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,546
Hurley told me that you
lost your wedding ring.

392
00:32:59,146 --> 00:33:00,639
I was just sitting here,

393
00:33:02,048 --> 00:33:05,357
telling myself it's silly
to be so upset about it.

394
00:33:07,190 --> 00:33:09,174
It is just a thing.

395
00:33:19,673 --> 00:33:21,622
Well,  they've only been gone a few days,
you know--

396
00:33:21,652 --> 00:33:22,691
Don't.

397
00:33:23,787 --> 00:33:27,340
I'm sick of everyone
saying he is all right.

398
00:33:28,165 --> 00:33:30,000
He's not all right.

399
00:33:32,592 --> 00:33:34,637
Claire found the bottle--

400
00:33:36,114 --> 00:33:38,409
the one with the
messages inside.

401
00:33:39,449 --> 00:33:41,094
The one from the raft.

402
00:33:48,078 --> 00:33:49,689
Where is it?

403
00:33:51,665 --> 00:33:53,102
I buried it.

404
00:34:21,273 --> 00:34:22,050
Stop.

405
00:34:23,664 --> 00:34:24,937
Let me see your water.

406
00:34:30,014 --> 00:34:31,957
You keep slowing us down,
we're gonna leave you behind.

407
00:34:31,987 --> 00:34:33,882
Go ahead. Leave me behind.

408
00:34:34,097 --> 00:34:36,362
All right. See ya.

409
00:34:38,299 --> 00:34:39,770
Got a question for ya.

410
00:34:41,223 --> 00:34:42,027
Yeah?

411
00:34:45,097 --> 00:34:46,618
Now that your tracker's gone,

412
00:34:46,723 --> 00:34:48,762
how you gonna find
our camp without me?

413
00:34:50,761 --> 00:34:53,382
Walk across the island,
follow the beaches.

414
00:34:54,830 --> 00:34:56,685
And Eko's coming back.

415
00:34:58,790 --> 00:34:59,827
You married?

416
00:35:00,814 --> 00:35:01,759
What?

417
00:35:02,968 --> 00:35:04,217
Are you married?

418
00:35:05,519 --> 00:35:06,417
No.

419
00:35:07,632 --> 00:35:11,010
Too bad.
You seem suited for it.

420
00:35:12,372 --> 00:35:13,648
Funny.

421
00:35:15,077 --> 00:35:16,426
What about you?

422
00:35:16,524 --> 00:35:18,096
No, ma'am.

423
00:35:18,278 --> 00:35:19,660
You gay?

424
00:35:21,105 --> 00:35:22,268
Funny.

425
00:35:24,862 --> 00:35:25,952
Let's go.

426
00:35:26,418 --> 00:35:27,864
What are we waiting for?

427
00:35:54,386 --> 00:35:55,385
Wait here.

428
00:35:55,919 --> 00:35:57,297
We lost his trail.

429
00:35:57,785 --> 00:35:59,621
I go back and find it.

430
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:14,341
What are you doing?

431
00:36:16,747 --> 00:36:17,554
Go back.

432
00:36:18,201 --> 00:36:19,072
Michael!

433
00:36:19,194 --> 00:36:20,574
Go back, man!

434
00:36:32,638 --> 00:36:35,027
Walt! Walt!

435
00:36:36,050 --> 00:36:37,246
Walt!

436
00:36:38,270 --> 00:36:39,159
Michael!

437
00:36:39,292 --> 00:36:40,486
Go away!

438
00:36:40,752 --> 00:36:42,302
I'm not going back without him!

439
00:36:42,806 --> 00:36:44,869
Walt! I'm here!

440
00:36:45,607 --> 00:36:46,992
Where are you, man?!

441
00:36:47,969 --> 00:36:49,412
- Walt!
- Shh!

442
00:36:49,603 --> 00:36:51,544
What, you worried
they're gonna hear me?

443
00:36:51,574 --> 00:36:53,112
Let them take me!

444
00:36:54,112 --> 00:36:56,631
Come! Come take me!

445
00:36:56,908 --> 00:36:59,224
Shouting is not a good idea.

446
00:36:59,891 --> 00:37:01,659
You need to come
back with us now.

447
00:37:01,745 --> 00:37:03,703
I'm not leaving him out here!

448
00:37:04,069 --> 00:37:05,647
Stay away from me.

449
00:37:10,598 --> 00:37:12,406
I know they took your son.

450
00:37:13,950 --> 00:37:17,919
But you have no idea what
these people are capable of.

451
00:37:18,888 --> 00:37:21,488
And they will not be found
if they don't want to be.

452
00:37:23,634 --> 00:37:27,353
They took him right
out of my hands.

453
00:37:27,430 --> 00:37:30,257
Right out of my hands.

454
00:37:32,504 --> 00:37:34,432
I'm not going back without him.

455
00:37:45,735 --> 00:37:49,973
You find Walt... Michael.

456
00:38:24,051 --> 00:38:25,231
Can I see it?

457
00:38:37,366 --> 00:38:40,529
Kate, those are private.

458
00:38:44,019 --> 00:38:45,324
Kate, stop.

459
00:38:45,929 --> 00:38:47,565
What are you doing?

460
00:38:56,734 --> 00:38:58,000
We didn't, uh...

461
00:39:03,338 --> 00:39:04,494
I didn't say good-bye.

462
00:39:09,090 --> 00:39:10,404
Sawyer?

463
00:39:28,906 --> 00:39:30,052
Sun...

464
00:40:53,764 --> 00:40:55,184
  

465
00:40:56,628 --> 00:40:57,983
  

466
00:40:58,254 --> 00:41:00,490
