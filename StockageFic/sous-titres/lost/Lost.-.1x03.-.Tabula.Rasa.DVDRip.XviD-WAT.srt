2
00:00:10,176 --> 00:00:12,167
Do you think he's gonna live?

3
00:00:13,079 --> 00:00:15,775
- Do you know him?
- He was sitting next to me.

4
00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:18,340
[Sayid] You think they
would have come by now.

5
00:00:19,552 --> 00:00:22,544
- Who?
- Anyone.

6
00:00:22,622 --> 00:00:24,021
What is it, like checkers?

7
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:26,957
Not really.
lt's a better game than checkers.

8
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:29,461
Two players. Two sides.

9
00:00:29,529 --> 00:00:32,726
One is light. One is dark.

10
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:35,089
Walt...

11
00:00:37,337 --> 00:00:38,998
...do you wanna know a secret?

12
00:01:01,628 --> 00:01:03,755
Don't trust her.

13
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:05,821
She's dangerous.

14
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:09,960
- Try not to move, man.
- l have to find her.

15
00:01:10,036 --> 00:01:13,699
- l have to bring her back.
- Yeah, you keep saying that.

16
00:01:13,773 --> 00:01:17,300
Every time l ask who you have to
bring back, you pass out on me again.

17
00:01:17,377 --> 00:01:20,676
Since your fever's pretty high,
l'm guessing you have no idea

18
00:01:20,747 --> 00:01:23,716
- who the hell you're talking about.
- My cuffs.

19
00:01:23,783 --> 00:01:25,808
My handcuffs.

20
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:30,016
- Where are my cuffs?
- What?

21
00:01:32,725 --> 00:01:34,852
- My jacket pocket.
- l don't...

22
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:37,522
- Jacket pocket!
- Okay.

23
00:01:45,705 --> 00:01:47,969
Dangerous.

24
00:01:48,041 --> 00:01:50,271
She's dangerous.

25
00:02:11,664 --> 00:02:14,428
- [Boone] lt's getting dark.
- [Sawyer] Pick up the pace.

26
00:02:14,501 --> 00:02:16,128
- Hick.
- A little louder?

27
00:02:16,202 --> 00:02:17,726
[Sayid]
We should make camp.

28
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:19,931
- What, here?
- Yes, here.

29
00:02:20,006 --> 00:02:22,406
[Sawyer] l'm not stopping.
Have a nice cookout.

30
00:02:22,475 --> 00:02:25,933
- Walk through the jungle in the dark.
- Afraid the trees will get us?

31
00:02:26,012 --> 00:02:29,004
No. What is knocking
down the trees will get you.

32
00:02:29,082 --> 00:02:31,846
You're so worried, how about
you give me the clip back?

33
00:02:31,918 --> 00:02:33,351
Put your gun in your pants.

34
00:02:33,419 --> 00:02:36,911
Sayid's right. Keep walking,
you're not gonna make it to the beach.

35
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:38,890
Yeah, why's that?

36
00:02:41,961 --> 00:02:43,451
Trust me.

37
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:45,788
[Sayid]
This is Australia.

38
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:49,198
- This is us.
- Nice stick.

39
00:02:49,269 --> 00:02:51,601
Two days ago,
we take off from Sydney.

40
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:53,662
We fly along the same northeast route

41
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:56,538
every commercial airliner
bound for Los Angeles does.

42
00:02:56,609 --> 00:02:59,510
The pilot said he lost
communication with the ground?

43
00:02:59,579 --> 00:03:02,571
Yeah, six hours in.
He turned around and headed for Fiji.

44
00:03:02,649 --> 00:03:04,116
So we changed course.

45
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:07,210
Regrettably,
no one knew we changed course.

46
00:03:07,287 --> 00:03:09,721
The turbulence hit.

47
00:03:10,623 --> 00:03:11,749
We know the rest.

48
00:03:13,226 --> 00:03:16,389
The pilot said we were
over 1 ,000 miles off course.

49
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:19,388
[Charlie]
They'll find us.

50
00:03:19,465 --> 00:03:23,060
They have satellites that can
take pictures of your license plate.

51
00:03:23,136 --> 00:03:25,570
lf only we were all
wearing license plates.

52
00:03:26,606 --> 00:03:30,167
- Aren't you the pessimist.
- Basic photography<i>:</i> point and shoot.

53
00:03:30,243 --> 00:03:33,406
Satellites can shoot,
but they must be told where to point.

54
00:03:33,513 --> 00:03:36,846
Oh. Bollocks.

55
00:03:36,916 --> 00:03:39,908
Okay, really enjoyed
the puppet show. Fantastic.

56
00:03:39,986 --> 00:03:42,853
So we're stuck
in the middle of damn nowhere.

57
00:03:42,922 --> 00:03:44,913
How about we talk
about that other thing?

58
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:49,251
The transmission Abdul
picked up on his radio.

59
00:03:49,329 --> 00:03:52,196
The French chick that said,
''They're all dead.''

60
00:03:52,265 --> 00:03:55,530
The transmission's been on a loop for...
How long, freckles?

61
00:03:56,736 --> 00:04:00,228
- Sixteen years.
- Right.

62
00:04:00,306 --> 00:04:02,274
Let's talk about that.

63
00:04:06,312 --> 00:04:08,507
We have to tell the others
when we get back.

64
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:11,516
- Tell them what exactly?
- What we heard.

65
00:04:11,584 --> 00:04:14,781
- l'm not a stupid translator.
- No one tell them anything.

66
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:21,721
To relay what we heard without fully
understanding it will cause a panic.

67
00:04:21,794 --> 00:04:25,059
lf we tell them what we know,

68
00:04:25,131 --> 00:04:27,190
we take away their hope.

69
00:04:28,201 --> 00:04:31,932
And hope is a very
dangerous thing to lose.

70
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:35,335
So we lie?

71
00:04:41,481 --> 00:04:44,211
- Was it a dinosaur?
- lt wasn't a dinosaur.

72
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:47,412
- You said you didn't see it.
- l didn't.

73
00:04:48,755 --> 00:04:50,746
So, how do you know
it wasn't a dinosaur?

74
00:04:50,823 --> 00:04:52,723
Because dinosaurs are extinct.

75
00:04:53,526 --> 00:04:55,118
Oh.

76
00:04:55,194 --> 00:04:56,593
Yeah.

77
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:03,333
So, what's his story?
He looks kind of...

78
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:06,170
- ...dying.
- He's not gonna die.

79
00:05:06,239 --> 00:05:08,298
- He's yellow.
- His wound is infected,

80
00:05:08,374 --> 00:05:11,639
- but the antibiotics will fight it off.
- What if they don't?

81
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:15,580
- His body will shut down...
- [Marshal groaning]

82
00:05:15,648 --> 00:05:17,138
...one piece at a time.

83
00:05:17,216 --> 00:05:20,014
His abdomen goes rigid, then...

84
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:27,115
- He looks like he's in pain.
- [groaning continues]

85
00:05:27,193 --> 00:05:28,683
Yeah.

86
00:05:32,532 --> 00:05:33,863
What's this?

87
00:05:36,269 --> 00:05:38,567
Uh... Dude?

88
00:05:39,806 --> 00:05:41,296
Uh...

89
00:05:44,711 --> 00:05:47,373
- What do you think she did?
- None of my business.

90
00:05:47,447 --> 00:05:50,041
- She looks pretty hardcore.
- Hurley.

91
00:06:30,923 --> 00:06:32,515
What are you doing?

92
00:06:33,659 --> 00:06:37,095
l'm standing guard.
You heard what they said's out there.

93
00:06:37,163 --> 00:06:38,755
You took my gun off me, boy?

94
00:06:38,831 --> 00:06:41,527
He doesn't believe in guns.
He goes on marches.

95
00:06:41,601 --> 00:06:43,398
- l don't.
- Give it back.

96
00:06:43,469 --> 00:06:46,097
- Aljazeera will protect us.
- Aljazeera's a network.

97
00:06:46,172 --> 00:06:49,266
- l'll keep the damn gun.
- We should give it to her.

98
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:58,247
- Yeah. Kate should hold the gun.
- Fine with me.

99
00:07:01,988 --> 00:07:02,977
Well?

100
00:07:18,304 --> 00:07:20,295
[gun cocks]

101
00:07:21,374 --> 00:07:24,138
- Good morning.
- Morning.

102
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:28,340
- You're sleeping in my sheep pen.
- Sorry.

103
00:07:33,653 --> 00:07:35,644
- How'd you get here?
- l walked.

104
00:07:35,721 --> 00:07:37,018
- You walked?
- Yeah.

105
00:07:37,089 --> 00:07:39,580
- From where?
- Town.

106
00:07:39,659 --> 00:07:43,117
- Nearest town's 1 5 kilometers.
- Maybe that's why l'm exhausted.

107
00:07:43,196 --> 00:07:44,629
What's your name?

108
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:49,295
- Annie.
- You hungry, Annie?

109
00:07:53,739 --> 00:07:58,403
So, you want to tell me why
you're trespassing on my property?

110
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:00,469
l ran out of money.

111
00:08:01,747 --> 00:08:03,738
You're an American?

112
00:08:03,816 --> 00:08:07,877
Canadian. l graduated from college
and figured l'd see the world.

113
00:08:07,954 --> 00:08:10,980
Australia was top of my list,
so l hopped a flight to Melbourne,

114
00:08:11,057 --> 00:08:14,720
but l don't know anybody here,
so l figured l'd walk for a while.

115
00:08:14,794 --> 00:08:17,957
Melbourne's a hundred
kilometers from here.

116
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:19,361
l like walking.

117
00:08:19,432 --> 00:08:21,923
And you just happened
to wander onto my farm?

118
00:08:22,869 --> 00:08:24,393
l like farms too.

119
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:32,841
Do you know how to work one?

120
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:35,845
Yeah.

121
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:42,685
My wife died
eight months ago Wednesday.

122
00:08:44,423 --> 00:08:47,449
She left me with too many chores
and a hell of a mortgage.

123
00:08:48,794 --> 00:08:50,989
lf you help me with the first one,

124
00:08:51,063 --> 00:08:53,190
l'll give you a fair wage
and a place to stay.

125
00:08:56,669 --> 00:08:57,829
Deal.

126
00:08:57,904 --> 00:08:59,735
Uh...

127
00:09:01,407 --> 00:09:03,341
l'm a lefty.

128
00:09:03,409 --> 00:09:05,070
[chuckles]

129
00:09:06,078 --> 00:09:08,239
Dude. Dude!

130
00:09:10,116 --> 00:09:12,414
Hey, dude, they're back.

131
00:09:14,086 --> 00:09:16,953
[Sayid] As you and the others know,
we hiked up the mountain

132
00:09:17,023 --> 00:09:20,049
in an attempt to help
the rescue team locate us.

133
00:09:21,761 --> 00:09:23,922
The transceiver failed
to pick up a signal.

134
00:09:23,996 --> 00:09:27,022
We weren't able to send out
a call for help.

135
00:09:27,099 --> 00:09:28,999
But we're not giving up.

136
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:32,868
lf we gather electronic equipment,
your cell phones, laptops,

137
00:09:32,939 --> 00:09:35,874
l can boost the signal,
and we can try again.

138
00:09:35,942 --> 00:09:38,433
But that may take some time,
so for now,

139
00:09:38,511 --> 00:09:41,241
we should begin
rationing our remaining food.

140
00:09:41,314 --> 00:09:45,148
lf it rains, we should set up
tarps to collect water.

141
00:09:45,217 --> 00:09:48,414
l need to organize
three separate groups.

142
00:09:48,487 --> 00:09:51,786
Each group should have a leader.
One group for water.

143
00:09:51,857 --> 00:09:55,623
l'll organize that. Who's gonna
organize electronics? You?

144
00:09:55,695 --> 00:09:57,356
Rationing food?

145
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:59,694
Okay.

146
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:04,361
And l will need a third group to concern
themselves with the construction...

147
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:06,598
- Hi.
- Hey.

148
00:10:10,376 --> 00:10:11,775
l, uh...

149
00:10:13,045 --> 00:10:15,172
l need to tell you something.

150
00:10:16,182 --> 00:10:18,582
Okay. Sure.

151
00:10:23,055 --> 00:10:26,547
- [Sayid] ...stay out of the sun.
- We couldn't send out a signal

152
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:29,459
because there was
another signal blocking it.

153
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:35,025
The other signal, we heard it.

154
00:10:36,736 --> 00:10:39,000
lt was a distress call
from a French woman.

155
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:42,171
She said that the others were dead.

156
00:10:42,241 --> 00:10:45,039
That something had killed them all.

157
00:10:45,111 --> 00:10:47,204
She was alone on the island.

158
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:52,144
lt's been playing for 1 6 years, Jack.

159
00:11:01,193 --> 00:11:03,320
l wanted to tell you.

160
00:11:10,036 --> 00:11:11,367
Anything else?

161
00:11:19,712 --> 00:11:22,545
How is he?
The man with the shrapnel in his side.

162
00:11:25,751 --> 00:11:29,312
- He's touch-and-go.
- Did he wake up?

163
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:32,722
Just for a few seconds
during the surgery.

164
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:35,493
He say anything?

165
00:11:39,265 --> 00:11:40,425
No.

166
00:11:55,314 --> 00:11:57,305
[Hurley]
So, what did she say?

167
00:11:58,384 --> 00:12:00,375
[Jack]
She didn't say anything.

168
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:03,581
But you told her you knew.

169
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:06,653
l don't know anything.

170
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:09,217
Well, you kinda know
she's in that mug shot.

171
00:12:09,295 --> 00:12:11,092
And we found those handcuffs.

172
00:12:11,163 --> 00:12:14,997
And that guy keeps mumbling
''She's dangerous'' over and over.

173
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:18,434
lt's not my business.
Not my problem.

174
00:12:23,375 --> 00:12:25,366
Yeah, you're right.

175
00:12:25,444 --> 00:12:28,675
We'll let Johnny Fever take care
of her when he gets better.

176
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:32,115
He's not getting better
if we don't get stronger antibiotics.

177
00:12:32,184 --> 00:12:35,915
- That stuff from the luggage...
- For ear infections and foot fungus.

178
00:12:35,988 --> 00:12:37,615
We went through everything.

179
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:41,148
What about that luggage
in the overhead compartments?

180
00:12:41,227 --> 00:12:43,957
- That's inside the plane.
- Yeah?

181
00:12:45,097 --> 00:12:47,930
But the bodies are in there,

182
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,060
and they're all... dead.

183
00:12:54,473 --> 00:12:58,307
- l'll handle it. Keep an eye on...
- Great. Yeah, l'd love to. On it.

184
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,061
[thud]

185
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:30,302

187
00:13:37,283 --> 00:13:38,580
Boo.

188

- [sighs]
- [chuckles]

189
00:13:41,153 --> 00:13:44,281
- What are you doing in here?
- Trick-or-treat. Same as you.

190
00:13:44,356 --> 00:13:45,755
You're looting.

191
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:48,589
Ah, you say ''potato...''

192
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:53,598
- What's in the bag?
- Booze, smokes, a couple <i>Playboys.</i>

193
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:56,464
- What's in yours?
- Medicine.

194
00:13:56,535 --> 00:13:59,527
Well, just about sums it up, don't it?

195
00:13:59,605 --> 00:14:02,699
You do this back home too?
Steal from the dead?

196
00:14:02,775 --> 00:14:05,767
Brother, you got to wake up
and smell the gull crap here.

197
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:08,177
Rescue ain't coming.

198
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:11,680
You're just wasting your time,

199
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:14,548
trying to save a guy who,
last time l checked,

200
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:18,818
had a piece of metal the size of my head
sticking out of his breadbasket.

201
00:14:20,092 --> 00:14:22,026
Let me ask you something.

202
00:14:22,094 --> 00:14:24,654
How many of those pills
you gonna use to fix him up?

203
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:26,789
- As many as it takes.
- Yeah?

204
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:28,857
How many you got?

205
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:37,809
You're just not looking
at the big picture, doc.

206
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:39,868
You're still back in civilization.

207
00:14:39,945 --> 00:14:42,709
Yeah? And where are you?

208
00:14:42,781 --> 00:14:44,681
Me?

209
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:46,741
l'm in the wild.

Well, look on the bright side.

215
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:16,976
Whoever's this was is
probably better off than we are.

216
00:15:17,049 --> 00:15:18,607
l got it.

217
00:15:19,385 --> 00:15:23,048
[speaking Korean]

218
00:15:55,554 --> 00:15:58,284
- How's the baby?
- lt's okay, l think.

219
00:15:58,357 --> 00:16:00,188
Good.

220
00:16:01,126 --> 00:16:03,060
So your...

221
00:16:03,128 --> 00:16:05,323
Your husband,
was he on the flight?

222
00:16:05,397 --> 00:16:07,365
Oh, no, l'm not married.

223
00:16:09,702 --> 00:16:10,691
Oh.

224
00:16:10,769 --> 00:16:12,566
l know. How modern of me.

225
00:16:13,305 --> 00:16:16,001
Well, who needs men, right?

226
00:16:16,075 --> 00:16:17,599
Bloody useless.

227
00:16:21,347 --> 00:16:25,078
So you guys hiked all the way up
that mountain for nothing, huh?

228
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:31,452
Hey. Sorry.

229
00:16:32,558 --> 00:16:34,856

Hurley.

233
00:16:47,106 --> 00:16:49,597
l was looking for Jack.
l thought he might be there.

234
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:51,040
Yeah, no.

235
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:53,977
He went to go get some medicine.
Over there.

236
00:16:58,217 --> 00:17:00,549
- Where, in the fuselage?
- What?

237
00:17:00,619 --> 00:17:05,386
Yeah. Yeah, in the,

[door opens]

242
00:18:00,446 --> 00:18:02,778
The bank would have
given you a heck of a toaster

243
00:18:02,848 --> 00:18:04,839
if you'd kept that
in a savings account.

244
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:07,249
What do l need a toaster for?

245
00:18:07,319 --> 00:18:09,378
You're hiding your wages
in a tin can.

246
00:18:09,455 --> 00:18:12,913
l mean, l would have
held onto it for you.

247
00:18:12,991 --> 00:18:15,289
l got trust issues.

248
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:23,091
- Weren't you gonna say goodbye?
- l wrote you a note.

249
00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:29,767
You've been here
almost three months,

250
00:18:29,842 --> 00:18:32,140
and every time
l ask you about yourself,

251
00:18:32,211 --> 00:18:34,202
you get that look in your eye.

252
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:35,974
Yeah, that one.

253
00:18:37,216 --> 00:18:39,377
So l mind my own business.

254
00:18:39,451 --> 00:18:42,978
l figured maybe you got off on
the wrong side of a bad relationship.

255
00:18:43,055 --> 00:18:47,389
Maybe you ran. l always knew
you'd leave here someday.

256
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:50,485
l guess l hoped it wouldn't be
in the middle of the night.

257
00:18:52,998 --> 00:18:55,330
- l'm sorry.
- Yeah.

258
00:18:56,668 --> 00:18:58,932
So am l.

Annie, why don't you
just stay one more night?

l'll drive you to the train station
first thing in the morning. l promise.

261
00:19:16,788 --> 00:19:19,086
- Okay.
- Good.

262
00:19:20,092 --> 00:19:22,083
l get it, you know.

263
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:24,459

l was just checking to see if he...

273
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:15,044
He jumped on me.
He grabbed me.

274
00:20:19,618 --> 00:20:22,678
ls he... okay now?

275
00:20:22,754 --> 00:20:25,314
He's not responding to antibiotics,

276
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:28,291
he's bleeding internally,
and his fever's pushing 1 04...

277

...and his abdomen's rigid.

278
00:20:41,773 --> 00:20:43,104
He needs water.

279
00:20:48,113 --> 00:20:50,104
So, what are you gonna do about it?

280
00:20:50,182 --> 00:20:51,843
- About what?
- About him.

281
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:54,909
- l told you, he needs water.
- Will he suffer?

282
00:20:56,455 --> 00:20:59,549
- What?
- Will it be quick?

283
00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:01,525
No, it won't be quick.

284
00:21:01,593 --> 00:21:04,460
- Two, three, maybe four days.
- And he'll feel it?

285
00:21:04,529 --> 00:21:06,793
Yeah, he'll feel it.

286
00:21:06,865 --> 00:21:09,629
Can't you put him out of his misery?

287
00:21:15,707 --> 00:21:18,073

Do they listen to Patsy Cline

291
00:21:42,401 --> 00:21:44,767
They listen to Patsy Cline everywhere.
