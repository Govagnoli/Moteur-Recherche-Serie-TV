[narrator] <i>Previously on</i> Lost<i>:</i>

2
00:00:02,502 --> 00:00:04,470
You didn't tell us
your condition.

3
00:00:04,537 --> 00:00:08,029
My condition is not an issue.
l've lived with it for four years.

4
00:00:08,108 --> 00:00:10,167
l'll get you on a plane
back to Sydney.

5
00:00:10,243 --> 00:00:11,835
l don't want to go to Sydney!

6
00:00:11,911 --> 00:00:15,540
You don't know who you're dealing with.
Don't tell me what l can't do!

7
00:00:15,615 --> 00:00:18,675
This is destiny.
This is my destiny!

8
00:00:18,752 --> 00:00:21,550
l'm supposed to do this, damn it!

9
00:00:21,621 --> 00:00:25,216
How do you open a hatch
that has no handle, no latch,

10
00:00:25,291 --> 00:00:27,384
no discernible way
of opening it?

11
00:00:35,835 --> 00:00:37,427
What's that?

12
00:00:38,638 --> 00:00:40,538
A game.

13
00:00:40,607 --> 00:00:43,132
My favorite game.
l used to play with my brother.

14
00:00:43,209 --> 00:00:44,733
lt's called Mouse Trap.

15
00:00:45,512 --> 00:00:47,605
How do you play?

16
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:50,080
You start with
all these parts off the board.

17
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:53,642
And then, one by one,

18
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:56,052
you build the trap.

19
00:00:56,122 --> 00:00:58,249
Shoe. Bucket. Tub.

20
00:00:58,324 --> 00:01:00,519
Piece by piece,
it all comes together.

21
00:01:00,593 --> 00:01:05,087
And then you wait till your opponent
lands here on the old Cheese Wheel.

22
00:01:05,165 --> 00:01:06,996
Then if you set it up
just right,

23
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:10,400
you spring the trap.

24
00:01:12,439 --> 00:01:14,031
Go ahead, kiddo.

25
00:01:18,244 --> 00:01:20,303
May l help you, ma'am?

26
00:01:21,314 --> 00:01:23,475
Yes...

27
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:26,075
Could you tell me
where the footballs are?

28
00:01:26,152 --> 00:01:29,315
Yeah. Aisle eight
for regulation.

29
00:01:29,389 --> 00:01:30,879
Aisle fifteen for Nerf.

30
00:01:30,957 --> 00:01:34,449
Oh, yes, thank you. Thanks.

31
00:01:44,804 --> 00:01:46,965
You want my opinion?

32
00:01:48,074 --> 00:01:50,099
Boone, you gotta
have some faith.

33
00:01:50,176 --> 00:01:54,272
All we gotta do is break the glass,
and then we're in.

34
00:01:54,347 --> 00:01:56,542
Trebuchet delivers
half a ton of force.

35
00:01:56,616 --> 00:01:58,948
Why is it a trebuchet?
Looks like a catapult.

36
00:01:59,018 --> 00:02:03,250
lt's called a trebuchet,
because it's a trebuchet.

37
00:02:03,323 --> 00:02:04,790
l don't get you, man.

38
00:02:04,858 --> 00:02:08,419
One minute you're quoting Nietzsche,
now you're an engineer.

39
00:02:08,495 --> 00:02:11,123
l don't think
l can spell ''trebuchet.''

40
00:02:11,197 --> 00:02:12,994
There's a T on the end.

41
00:02:13,833 --> 00:02:15,994
l'm serious.

42
00:02:16,069 --> 00:02:17,934
We've been coming here every day.

43
00:02:18,004 --> 00:02:19,733
You never talk about yourself.

44
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:21,865
Everybody's got a story.

45
00:02:21,941 --> 00:02:23,966
My story would bore you.

46
00:02:44,197 --> 00:02:46,665
Three. Two. One.

47
00:03:02,782 --> 00:03:04,977
This was supposed to work.

48
00:03:07,487 --> 00:03:09,819
- This was supposed to work!
- John!

49
00:03:12,392 --> 00:03:13,552
Your leg, man.

50
00:03:31,477 --> 00:03:32,910
You OK?

51
00:03:36,516 --> 00:03:37,915
Yeah.

52
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:40,143
l'm fine.

53
00:04:12,852 --> 00:04:14,911
[sizzles]

54
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:41,679
Your trebuchet.
Why didn't it work?

55
00:04:41,748 --> 00:04:44,308
lt didn't work because
it wasn't strong enough.

56
00:04:44,384 --> 00:04:46,511
That won't break,
whatever it's made of.

57
00:04:46,586 --> 00:04:49,077
Everything breaks
if you apply the right force.

58
00:04:49,155 --> 00:04:51,851
We'll build another invention
and hope it works?

59
00:04:51,924 --> 00:04:53,152
That's right.

60
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:57,555
- What if it doesn't?
- The island will tell us what to do.

61
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:59,461
What's that?

62
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:03,532
We should get back there.

63
00:05:03,603 --> 00:05:05,833
Salvage those pieces.

64
00:05:08,341 --> 00:05:09,774
Your leg OK?

65
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:12,501
lt's fine.

66
00:05:15,748 --> 00:05:17,579
[man] Night, John.

67
00:05:38,271 --> 00:05:40,432
[man] You all right, guy?

68
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:57,054
Hey! Hey!

69
00:05:57,123 --> 00:05:58,886
- You following me?
- l'm sorry.

70
00:05:58,958 --> 00:06:01,017
Who are you?

71
00:06:01,728 --> 00:06:03,127
l'm your mother.

72
00:06:11,304 --> 00:06:12,771
Look, Ms...

73
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:16,774
l don't know why
you think l'm your son

74
00:06:16,843 --> 00:06:19,869
- or how you found me, but...
- You're adopted, aren't you?

75
00:06:19,946 --> 00:06:22,972
No, l was raised
in a foster home.

76
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:26,041
Well, several
foster homes, actually.

77
00:06:26,119 --> 00:06:28,178
Look, l don't mean to be rude.

78
00:06:29,822 --> 00:06:31,551
What do you want from me?

79
00:06:32,859 --> 00:06:36,317
l want to tell you
that you're special.

80
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:38,990
Very special.

81
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:40,726
You are part of a design.

82
00:06:41,701 --> 00:06:44,397
You do realize that, don't you?

83
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:46,301
That our meeting,
me finding you,

84
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:50,873
this is a sign
of things to come.

85
00:06:52,311 --> 00:06:53,801
Great things.

86
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:58,448
My father...

87
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,254
...is he still alive?

88
00:07:03,322 --> 00:07:04,846
Still alive?

89
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:11,456
Oh, John,
don't you understand?

90
00:07:11,531 --> 00:07:13,999
You don't have a father.

91
00:07:15,635 --> 00:07:18,195
You were immaculately conceived.

92
00:07:29,215 --> 00:07:32,548
- Which one?
- That one.

93
00:07:32,618 --> 00:07:36,315
You're sure? This is the one l've
been using, and nothing's happening.

94
00:07:36,389 --> 00:07:39,620
- l'm sorry it's not helping.
- What's not helping?

95
00:07:40,726 --> 00:07:42,523
Nothing.

96
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:47,892
Thanks anyway.

97
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:49,400
Nice garden.

98
00:07:54,407 --> 00:07:56,602
What was that all about?

99
00:07:56,676 --> 00:07:58,143
He has headaches.

100
00:07:58,211 --> 00:08:01,442
Doesn't the guy have aspirin
stashed away somewhere?

101
00:08:01,514 --> 00:08:05,075
He says aspirin didn't help.

102
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:14,084
Can l ask you a question?

103
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,685
Say you're having
bad headaches.

104
00:08:16,762 --> 00:08:19,253
- Every day.
- You OK?

105
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:21,095
Yeah. l'm fine.

106
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:24,330
So, who are we talking
about then, Kate?

107
00:08:24,403 --> 00:08:27,133
- Sawyer.
- Uh-huh.

108
00:08:27,206 --> 00:08:29,367
There might be something
wrong with him.

109
00:08:29,442 --> 00:08:31,467
- What does he think?
- Says he's fine...

110
00:08:31,544 --> 00:08:34,138
- Then he's fine.
- He could be playing it down.

111
00:08:34,213 --> 00:08:36,306
- There could be something...
- Look...

112
00:08:36,382 --> 00:08:39,510
l'd love to check the guy out
and make sure he's OK,

113
00:08:39,585 --> 00:08:43,385
but we both know all l'm gonna get
for my trouble is a snappy one-liner,

114
00:08:43,456 --> 00:08:46,050
and if l'm real lucky,
a brand-new nickname.

115
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:47,752
l'm just over it.

116
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:56,793
You're late.

117
00:08:56,869 --> 00:08:59,838
- Late for what?
- Late for work.

118
00:08:59,906 --> 00:09:02,773
- l think l'm done working.
- l'm sorry. What?

119
00:09:02,842 --> 00:09:04,503
This is useless.

120
00:09:05,177 --> 00:09:07,236
You can't open that thing up.

121
00:09:07,313 --> 00:09:09,713
- Don't tell me what l can't do.
- You get it?

122
00:09:09,782 --> 00:09:12,250
lt's a dead end.
You're not getting in.

123
00:09:12,318 --> 00:09:14,183
We didn't find this by accident.

124
00:09:14,253 --> 00:09:18,121
- We're supposed...
- We're supposed to find this, right?

125
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:19,782
We're supposed to open it.

126
00:09:19,859 --> 00:09:21,622
Then tell me something.

127
00:09:21,694 --> 00:09:24,788
lf we're supposed to open it,
why haven't we opened it yet?

128
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,935
- The island will send us a sign.
- ''The island will...''

129
00:09:31,003 --> 00:09:34,097
All that's happening now
is our faith is being tested.

130
00:09:34,173 --> 00:09:36,437
We will open it.
The island will show us how.

131
00:09:36,509 --> 00:09:39,535
What kind of sign
will the island send us?

132
00:09:39,612 --> 00:09:41,944
[engine droning]

133
00:09:48,554 --> 00:09:50,317
Did you see that?

134
00:09:52,058 --> 00:09:53,548
- [crash]
- Boone?

135
00:09:59,398 --> 00:10:00,888
[pottery breaking]

136
00:10:02,735 --> 00:10:06,796
Theresa falls up the stairs.
Theresa falls down the stairs.

137
00:10:06,872 --> 00:10:08,635
Theresa falls up the stairs.

138
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:11,905
Theresa falls down the stairs.

139
00:10:11,978 --> 00:10:14,572
No, no.

140
00:10:14,647 --> 00:10:16,979
- Please don't.
- Theresa falls up the stairs.

141
00:10:17,049 --> 00:10:19,074
Don't take it back.

142
00:10:19,151 --> 00:10:20,743
[gasps]

143
00:10:44,844 --> 00:10:47,972
Boone. Wake up.

144
00:10:48,547 --> 00:10:50,708
- What time is it?
- lt's morning. Come on.

145
00:10:50,783 --> 00:10:53,343
OK. l'm up.

146
00:10:55,921 --> 00:10:57,115
What's going on?

147
00:10:59,425 --> 00:11:01,120
Come on. Let's go.

148
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:06,325
[man] Emily Annabeth Locke,

149
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:08,731
in ten thousand words or less.

150
00:11:14,774 --> 00:11:16,969
So, she's my mother.

151
00:11:17,043 --> 00:11:20,342
l lifted some hairs from her car
and matched them with your DNA.

152
00:11:20,413 --> 00:11:22,472
lt's 99 percent certain.

153
00:11:23,816 --> 00:11:26,376
She was institutionalized.
A few times.

154
00:11:26,452 --> 00:11:29,353
- What for?
- Nothing criminal or violent.

155
00:11:29,422 --> 00:11:33,324
lt's a type of schizophrenia.
lf she stays on her meds, she's OK.

156
00:11:38,431 --> 00:11:39,921
What about my father?

157
00:11:42,068 --> 00:11:45,970
Here's the thing. Your mother
sought you out, so she's fair game.

158
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:48,472
But this guy,

159
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:51,032
maybe he doesn't
even know you exist.

160
00:11:51,844 --> 00:11:54,176
Now, l've done this
enough times to know...

161
00:11:54,914 --> 00:11:59,248
...this stuff isn't meant to be,
even though it may feel that way.

162
00:11:59,318 --> 00:12:02,651
Look, this probably
won't have a happy ending.

163
00:12:05,825 --> 00:12:07,850
So...

164
00:12:08,594 --> 00:12:10,255
...do you want it or not?

165
00:12:12,064 --> 00:12:14,089
l want it.

166
00:12:21,273 --> 00:12:24,333
- Your name is?
- John Locke.

167
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:28,574
- l'm Anthony Cooper's son.
- Mr. Cooper doesn't have a son.

168
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:34,278
Tell him l don't want anything.

169
00:12:34,353 --> 00:12:35,877
My mother is Emily Locke.

170
00:12:36,789 --> 00:12:38,279
Please.

171
00:12:39,658 --> 00:12:41,285
Just a minute.

172
00:12:42,795 --> 00:12:46,128
Mr. Cooper, l got John Locke here,
says he's your son.

173
00:12:46,198 --> 00:12:47,859
Yes, sir.

174
00:12:47,933 --> 00:12:50,060
Well, you can go on in, sir.

175
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:02,478
[man] Well... [chuckles]

176
00:13:03,983 --> 00:13:06,247
This is awkward.

177
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:11,681
Thank you for seeing me, sir.
l'm... John.

178
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:17,656
Something tells me l'm gonna
want a drink for this?

179
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:20,290
- You want a drink?
- Yeah. All right. Great.

180
00:13:20,366 --> 00:13:23,802
- Scotch OK?
- Yeah, that's... Thanks.

181
00:13:25,437 --> 00:13:27,598
So who found who?

182
00:13:27,673 --> 00:13:29,732
- l'm sorry, sir?
- Emily. Your mother.

183
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:32,334
Did she find you,
or did you find her?

184
00:13:32,411 --> 00:13:34,470
She found me.

185
00:13:34,547 --> 00:13:35,946
How did she look?

186
00:13:36,015 --> 00:13:39,542
- All right, l guess.
- She say anything about me?

187
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,788
She said l didn't
have a father.

188
00:13:42,855 --> 00:13:46,951
That l was
immaculately conceived.

189
00:13:49,295 --> 00:13:51,058
Really? [chuckles]

190
00:13:52,631 --> 00:13:55,429
Well, l guess that
makes me God, huh?

191
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:58,800
l didn't know you existed
until a year after you were born.

192
00:13:58,871 --> 00:14:03,535
She told me she wasn't gonna
have the baby, you, at all.

193
00:14:03,609 --> 00:14:08,069
She drops off the face of the planet.
She turns up asking for money,

194
00:14:08,147 --> 00:14:10,206
telling me she put you
up for adoption.

195
00:14:10,282 --> 00:14:12,273
You gonna drink that or what?

196
00:14:15,087 --> 00:14:16,850
You have a family
of your own?

197
00:14:19,491 --> 00:14:21,959
- No, sir.
- Me neither.

198
00:14:22,027 --> 00:14:23,961
l tried it a couple times.

199
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:26,520
Didn't take.

200
00:14:26,599 --> 00:14:29,159
- Do you hunt?
- No.

201
00:14:29,235 --> 00:14:31,328
You're not an animal rights nut-job?

202
00:14:31,403 --> 00:14:33,371
No, sir.

203
00:14:33,439 --> 00:14:35,430
What are you doing this Sunday?

204
00:14:36,809 --> 00:14:39,403
- Nothing.
- You wanna go hunting?

205
00:14:39,478 --> 00:14:43,744
Uh... Well, l'd like that.

206
00:14:43,816 --> 00:14:45,511
Yeah, l'd like that very much.

207
00:14:50,122 --> 00:14:52,352
l had a dream last night.

208
00:14:52,424 --> 00:14:54,221
l asked for a sign.

209
00:14:54,293 --> 00:14:56,989
And then l saw
a plane crash.

210
00:14:57,062 --> 00:14:58,893
A Beechcraft.
Right out there.

211
00:14:59,999 --> 00:15:01,364
lt was a dream, but...

212
00:15:01,433 --> 00:15:04,630
...it was the most real thing
l've ever experienced.

213
00:15:06,138 --> 00:15:09,733
- l know where to go now.
- Go for what?

214
00:15:09,808 --> 00:15:12,174
To find what we need
to open this bastard up.

215
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:15,179
You using that paste that
made me see my sister get eaten?

216
00:15:15,247 --> 00:15:17,272
No, Boone, no.

217
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:22,045
'Cause, l gotta tell you,
signs and dreams and...

218
00:15:22,121 --> 00:15:23,850
Who's Theresa?

219
00:15:26,625 --> 00:15:28,718
- What?
- ''Theresa falls up the stairs.

220
00:15:28,794 --> 00:15:30,955
Theresa falls down the stairs.''

221
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:37,394
You were saying that
in the dream.

222
00:15:39,071 --> 00:15:41,835
- How would you know about that?
- l don't know,

223
00:15:41,907 --> 00:15:43,966
but we're supposed
to go to this place.

224
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:47,577
We're supposed
to find that plane.

225
00:15:47,646 --> 00:15:50,137
Will you come with me?

226
00:16:08,901 --> 00:16:12,393
l was gonna ask you how this was going,
but it's coming together fast.

227
00:16:12,471 --> 00:16:14,336
[Michael] Fire wasn't
a total loss.

228
00:16:14,406 --> 00:16:16,931
We learned things
from building the first one,

229
00:16:17,009 --> 00:16:19,477
which is saving us
from trial and error.

230
00:16:19,545 --> 00:16:21,536
Now it's just...

231
00:16:22,581 --> 00:16:23,843
...trial.

232
00:16:23,916 --> 00:16:25,474
[speaking Korean]

233
00:16:25,551 --> 00:16:28,247
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, man, l know.

234
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,117
''Now, now.''

235
00:16:30,189 --> 00:16:31,850
Picking up a little Korean?

236
00:16:31,924 --> 00:16:35,553
Yeah. l'm pretty sure l know
how to say ''faster'' and ''idiot''.

237
00:16:49,575 --> 00:16:52,009
l hear you're having trouble
with your head.

238
00:16:53,912 --> 00:16:55,846
Now she got you
making house calls?

239
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:58,582
You're sensitive
to the light too?

240
00:16:58,650 --> 00:17:00,880
- l'm sensitive to you...
- All right.

241
00:17:00,953 --> 00:17:02,420
We'll see you.

242
00:17:04,623 --> 00:17:06,022
Doc!

243
00:17:08,327 --> 00:17:10,659
Sensitivity to the light,
that bad?

244
00:17:10,729 --> 00:17:13,596
- Depends.
- On what?

245
00:17:13,665 --> 00:17:15,860
On what's causing
your headaches.

246
00:17:15,934 --> 00:17:18,596
lt's not like it's
a tumor or something.

247
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:25,002
- What makes you think it's a tumor?
- l don't.

248
00:17:25,077 --> 00:17:27,272
Great. OK then.

249
00:17:29,314 --> 00:17:31,043
My uncle....

250
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:36,010
...he, uh...

251
00:17:37,523 --> 00:17:40,515
-...died of a brain tumor.
- Yeah?

252
00:17:42,528 --> 00:17:44,860
That run in the family?
Tumors?

253
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:47,262
What type of tumor was it?

254
00:17:47,332 --> 00:17:48,765
The type that kills you.

255
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:51,695
Do you smell anything funny?

256
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:55,262
Brain tumors bring on phantom smells.
Like something burning.

257
00:17:56,508 --> 00:17:59,068
Just headaches.

258
00:17:59,144 --> 00:18:01,772
Well, l'm sure
you're fine, then.

259
00:18:03,782 --> 00:18:06,376
lf this is worrying you,
there's tests l could do.

260
00:18:06,452 --> 00:18:07,885
Sorry, doc.

261
00:18:07,953 --> 00:18:09,477
Sounds fun, but...

262
00:18:10,622 --> 00:18:12,283
...my insurance ran out.

263
00:18:16,195 --> 00:18:19,130
lnsurance ran out.
That's a good one.

264
00:18:25,637 --> 00:18:27,628
[sniffing]

265
00:18:27,706 --> 00:18:30,573
l could've mentioned her name
out by the hatch one day.

266
00:18:30,642 --> 00:18:33,270
- [Locke] Who?
- Theresa.

267
00:18:33,345 --> 00:18:35,905
Maybe l was talking to myself.

268
00:18:35,981 --> 00:18:37,175
Maybe.

269
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:40,551
But you didn't.

270
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:44,817
So, in this dream
you saw a plane crash, right?

271
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:45,879
- Yeah.
- OK.

272
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:48,188
The fact that we were
just in a plane crash,

273
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:50,125
you didn't think
for one second...

274
00:18:50,195 --> 00:18:53,096
- John, you OK?
- l'm fine.

275
00:18:55,067 --> 00:18:57,194
- What is wrong with your leg?
- l'm fine.

276
00:19:01,907 --> 00:19:03,169
What?

277
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:13,413
Someone from camp
hiked all the way out here?

278
00:19:15,521 --> 00:19:17,546
- Nope.
- Where do you think it came from?

279
00:19:26,265 --> 00:19:27,527
Him.

280
00:19:36,642 --> 00:19:38,974
- Morning, Eddie.
- Morning, Mr. Locke.

281
00:19:39,044 --> 00:19:41,137
- You gonna get birds again?
- l hope so.

282
00:19:52,124 --> 00:19:53,284
Anthony?

283
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:55,826
You weren't supposed
to be here till 1 2<i>:</i>00.

284
00:19:57,129 --> 00:19:58,687
l thought you said 1 1 <i>:</i>00.

285
00:20:03,101 --> 00:20:07,470
- What is this?
- lt's a dialysis machine.

286
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:09,131
My kidney's failing.

287
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:12,109
Damn doctors say
l need a transplant.

288
00:20:12,177 --> 00:20:15,340
- When?
- Tomorrow, if it were up to me.

289
00:20:15,414 --> 00:20:17,473
l'm on the donor list.

290
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:21,110
But l'm an old man,
and it's a long list.

291
00:20:21,987 --> 00:20:26,014
- How long...
- The dialysis will be fine for awhile.

292
00:20:26,091 --> 00:20:28,457
l didn't tell you
for this exact reason.

293
00:20:28,527 --> 00:20:32,520
l'm not gonna let this spoil
a fantastic day, and neither should you.

294
00:20:32,598 --> 00:20:36,364
l'll get done here,
and we'll have a nice lunch

295
00:20:36,435 --> 00:20:39,097
and go shoot some birds.

296
00:20:42,174 --> 00:20:44,870
[Boone] He was a priest.

297
00:20:44,943 --> 00:20:46,740
How long you think
he's been dead?

298
00:20:46,812 --> 00:20:49,508
Clothing would decompose
within two years,

299
00:20:49,581 --> 00:20:51,879
but this is high-quality polyester.

300
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:54,783
Could be two years, could be ten.

301
00:20:54,853 --> 00:20:57,287
Gold teeth.
Obviously well-off.

302
00:21:00,959 --> 00:21:03,757
- What kind of money is that?
- Nigerian naira.

303
00:21:05,130 --> 00:21:08,258
What is a Nigerian priest doing
on an island in the South Pacific?

304
00:21:11,003 --> 00:21:13,403
l'm not so sure
he was a priest.

305
00:21:27,552 --> 00:21:30,544
[banging]

306
00:21:36,028 --> 00:21:37,791
You wanna keep it down?

307
00:21:44,036 --> 00:21:46,129
- That's it. Get up.
- What?

308
00:21:47,105 --> 00:21:48,697
Get up.

309
00:21:49,708 --> 00:21:52,541
- You're going to Jack.
- Do l get a lollipop?

310
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:58,211
- When did the headaches start?
- A few days ago. A week maybe.

311
00:22:00,819 --> 00:22:02,616
Do you have to be here?

312
00:22:02,688 --> 00:22:04,815
Do you have them
when you wake up?

313
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:07,256
Usually they hit me
middle of the day.

314
00:22:08,427 --> 00:22:10,088
What are you doing with that?

315
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:13,222
Checking how your pupils respond
to changing stimuli.

316
00:22:17,703 --> 00:22:19,500
What's that? That nod.

317
00:22:19,571 --> 00:22:21,903
- Let him do his thing.
- l am, but l wanna know

318
00:22:21,973 --> 00:22:24,840
- what he thinks l should...
- Shut up and relax.

319
00:22:25,477 --> 00:22:28,674
- What are you doing?
- You ever had a blood transfusion?

320
00:22:28,747 --> 00:22:31,272
What? No.

321
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:33,841
- Taken pills for malaria?
- Nope.

322
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:36,479
Have you ever had sex
with a prostitute?

323
00:22:39,291 --> 00:22:42,556
- What's that got to do with anything?
- ls that a yes?

324
00:22:46,131 --> 00:22:47,894
Yes.

325
00:22:49,267 --> 00:22:52,668
And have you ever contracted
a sexually transmitted disease?

326
00:22:54,639 --> 00:22:57,631
l'm gonna take that
as another yes.

327
00:22:57,709 --> 00:22:59,734
When was the last outbreak?

328
00:23:00,479 --> 00:23:02,379
Go to hell, doc.

329
00:23:06,017 --> 00:23:09,578
- l know he deserved it, but...
- He needs glasses.

330
00:23:17,028 --> 00:23:19,155
What's going on?

331
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:20,698
Nothing.

332
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,731
- You can barely walk, man.
- lt's the wound from the shrapnel.

333
00:23:27,406 --> 00:23:29,636
That's your right leg.
What's with your left?

334
00:23:29,708 --> 00:23:31,767
l'm fine.
Now stop asking.

335
00:23:33,311 --> 00:23:35,438
- That's it. Let's go back.
- l'm fine.

336
00:23:35,514 --> 00:23:37,607
No, you're not.
Let me get you to Jack.

337
00:23:37,682 --> 00:23:41,413
No. Jack wouldn't know the first thing
about what's wrong with me.

338
00:23:43,955 --> 00:23:45,286
John.

339
00:23:46,558 --> 00:23:48,856
- We've gotta go back.
- No.

340
00:23:48,927 --> 00:23:51,361
What is wrong with you?
Are you crazy?

341
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:54,365
- l was in a wheelchair.
- What?

342
00:23:54,433 --> 00:23:57,368
Paralyzed. For four years.

343
00:23:57,436 --> 00:23:59,734
The plane, our plane,

344
00:23:59,805 --> 00:24:03,707
l was in that chair when we took off,
but not after we crashed.

345
00:24:03,775 --> 00:24:05,436
Why were you in a wheelchair?

346
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:08,502
That doesn't matter anymore.

347
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:12,607
But this island,
it changed me.

348
00:24:12,684 --> 00:24:14,481
lt made me whole.

349
00:24:14,553 --> 00:24:17,920
Now it's trying to take it back,
and l don't know why.

350
00:24:19,991 --> 00:24:23,154
But it wants me
to follow what l saw.

351
00:24:23,228 --> 00:24:24,786
- What?
- l know it sounds crazy.

352
00:24:24,863 --> 00:24:27,263
Four weeks ago,
l wouldn't have believed it.

353
00:24:27,332 --> 00:24:29,095
We are here for a reason.

354
00:24:29,167 --> 00:24:32,261
There's something that
we were meant to find.

355
00:24:32,337 --> 00:24:34,498
lt's gonna help us
get into the hatch.

356
00:24:34,573 --> 00:24:36,006
l know it.

357
00:24:37,175 --> 00:24:39,006
But we gotta keep going.

358
00:24:43,348 --> 00:24:46,476
OK. Can you move your legs?

359
00:24:48,086 --> 00:24:51,112
Just help me up, son.

360
00:24:51,189 --> 00:24:53,953
OK.

361
00:24:54,025 --> 00:24:56,994
- [Locke groans]
- [Boone] OK.

362
00:24:59,731 --> 00:25:02,165
These doves fly a lot faster
than you think.

363
00:25:02,234 --> 00:25:04,031
So you gotta really lead them.

364
00:25:04,102 --> 00:25:06,093
lf you have to
drop it in high cover...

365
00:25:13,011 --> 00:25:15,445
- Got him.
- Yeah, you did.

366
00:25:15,514 --> 00:25:17,641
Good shot, son.

367
00:25:23,488 --> 00:25:27,948
John, your mother,
she may be a little crazy,

368
00:25:28,026 --> 00:25:30,358
but at least she
brought us together.

369
00:25:31,663 --> 00:25:33,460
And thank God it happened now,

370
00:25:33,532 --> 00:25:36,092
while we still have time.

371
00:25:40,572 --> 00:25:42,699
Let's find your bird.

372
00:25:58,423 --> 00:26:00,755
She was my nanny.

373
00:26:02,294 --> 00:26:05,195
Theresa, she was my nanny.

374
00:26:05,797 --> 00:26:07,731
My mother wasn't around much.

375
00:26:07,799 --> 00:26:10,290
l needed someone
to take it out on.

376
00:26:10,368 --> 00:26:12,893
My bedroom was at the top
of a flight of stairs.

377
00:26:12,971 --> 00:26:16,304
And l would sit in bed all day,
calling her on the intercom.

378
00:26:17,776 --> 00:26:20,438
One day she took a bad step.
Broke her neck.

379
00:26:22,747 --> 00:26:24,647
l was six.

380
00:26:29,988 --> 00:26:32,320
[laughs]

381
00:26:35,527 --> 00:26:37,017
What the hell is so funny?

382
00:26:52,978 --> 00:26:56,641
- ls that the plane you saw?
- As best l can tell.

383
00:26:57,749 --> 00:27:02,311
- You really saw it?
- Yeah. l really saw it.

384
00:27:02,387 --> 00:27:05,015
How long do you think
it's been there?

385
00:27:05,090 --> 00:27:08,287
Doesn't matter.
What's important is that we found it.

386
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:11,488
What's important
is what's inside it.

387
00:27:13,531 --> 00:27:15,590
What is inside of it?

388
00:27:16,601 --> 00:27:20,059
You're gonna have to climb up there
for us and find out.

389
00:27:44,596 --> 00:27:46,757
You can still
change your mind.

390
00:27:46,831 --> 00:27:49,629
Nah. They already
shaved my back.

391
00:27:53,238 --> 00:27:55,399
l'm so thankful for you.

392
00:27:58,710 --> 00:28:00,371
This was meant to be.

393
00:28:06,618 --> 00:28:09,382
See you on the other side, son.

394
00:28:17,295 --> 00:28:20,264
lf you're looking for a stool sample,
you can forget it.

395
00:28:22,367 --> 00:28:24,301
You've been reading a lot...

396
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:26,428
...since we came to the island.

397
00:28:26,504 --> 00:28:27,835
OK. So what?

398
00:28:31,509 --> 00:28:33,443
You...

399
00:28:33,511 --> 00:28:35,342
You've got...

400
00:28:36,748 --> 00:28:40,377
- You've got hyperopia.
- Hyperopia?

401
00:28:44,355 --> 00:28:46,186
That's...

402
00:28:48,293 --> 00:28:50,591
- What is that?
- You're farsighted.

403
00:28:51,229 --> 00:28:53,561
- Farsighted?
- Yeah.

404
00:28:53,631 --> 00:28:56,964
lt can develop later in life
when you add a new strain to the eyes.

405
00:28:57,035 --> 00:28:58,969
Like with reading.

406
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:09,569
Blurry.

407
00:29:17,956 --> 00:29:19,116
Better or worse?

408
00:29:21,659 --> 00:29:23,149
Worse.

409
00:29:25,463 --> 00:29:27,226
Uh-uh. No way.

410
00:29:27,298 --> 00:29:29,289
lt's not a fashion show.

411
00:30:07,939 --> 00:30:10,305
Har har, very funny.

412
00:30:11,142 --> 00:30:12,336
[Hurley] Dude.

413
00:30:12,410 --> 00:30:15,777
Looks like someone
steamrolled Harry Potter.

414
00:30:20,185 --> 00:30:22,585
You love this, don't you?

415
00:30:24,355 --> 00:30:25,788
You're welcome.

416
00:30:38,736 --> 00:30:43,002
[grunting, panting]

417
00:30:56,988 --> 00:30:58,387
Hang on.

418
00:32:02,186 --> 00:32:05,849
- [screaming]
- Boone!

419
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:07,789
Boone!

420
00:32:07,859 --> 00:32:09,690
l'm fine.

421
00:32:39,223 --> 00:32:41,248
Boone, what do you see?

422
00:32:43,628 --> 00:32:44,686
Boone!

423
00:32:44,762 --> 00:32:46,992
You wanna know
what's in your damn plane?

424
00:32:50,568 --> 00:32:52,627
Here's your sign.

425
00:33:00,411 --> 00:33:03,847
They're drug smugglers.
Heroin. That's all that's in here.

426
00:33:16,661 --> 00:33:18,925
l don't understand.

427
00:33:22,667 --> 00:33:24,658
l don't understand.

428
00:33:50,261 --> 00:33:52,252
[static]

429
00:33:54,599 --> 00:33:56,590
[creaking]

430
00:34:05,109 --> 00:34:07,737
Boone! Boone, get out!

431
00:34:12,083 --> 00:34:15,746
Hello. Hello.
Anybody out there?

432
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:18,687
- Mayday! Mayday!
- There's no time. Get out now!

433
00:34:18,756 --> 00:34:21,850
- <i>Is someone there?</i>
- Hello! Hello!

434
00:34:21,926 --> 00:34:25,828
- Can you hear me?
- <i>Repeat your transmission, please.</i>

435
00:34:27,665 --> 00:34:31,692
Hello! We're survivors of the crash
of Oceanic flight 81 5.

436
00:34:31,769 --> 00:34:34,431
- Please copy.
- [Locke] Get out now!

437
00:34:34,505 --> 00:34:36,496
<i>Hello. We're survivors</i>
<i>of flight 8 1 5.</i>

438
00:34:55,526 --> 00:34:59,690
Ah! Ahh!

439
00:34:59,764 --> 00:35:01,959
[panting] Ah!

440
00:35:02,033 --> 00:35:04,160
Ahh!

441
00:35:14,412 --> 00:35:16,277
[shouts]

442
00:35:31,329 --> 00:35:32,990
[Locke grunts, groans]

443
00:35:33,064 --> 00:35:35,862
[Locke shouts]

444
00:35:52,183 --> 00:35:55,949
So did you know before or after you
asked him about his latest outbreak?

445
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:59,683
l'd answer that,
but, you know,

446
00:35:59,757 --> 00:36:02,123
doctor-patient
confidentiality.

447
00:36:02,193 --> 00:36:03,626
Of course.

448
00:36:06,531 --> 00:36:08,260
Thank you for helping him.

449
00:36:08,332 --> 00:36:11,631
l know it was probably
the last thing you wanted to do.

450
00:36:13,638 --> 00:36:15,572
l didn't do it for him.

451
00:36:20,244 --> 00:36:22,508
Jack! Help!

452
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:27,147
No, no, no.

453
00:36:27,218 --> 00:36:29,448
Put him down up here.

454
00:36:31,355 --> 00:36:34,347
All right.
That's it.

455
00:36:34,425 --> 00:36:36,552
OK. Easy. Easy.

456
00:36:39,397 --> 00:36:41,490
- What happened?
- There was an accident.

457
00:36:41,566 --> 00:36:45,832
Boone fell off a cliff out near
the place where we were hunting.

458
00:36:53,778 --> 00:36:55,871
OK, l'm gonna need some water.

459
00:36:55,947 --> 00:36:59,474
Shirts, towels. Anything that l can use
to staunch the bleeding.

460
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:02,485
Kate, now!
Please.

461
00:37:06,123 --> 00:37:09,217
John, tell me exactly what happened.

462
00:37:10,962 --> 00:37:12,589
John?

463
00:37:13,764 --> 00:37:14,822
Locke!

464
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:17,367
Locke!

465
00:37:18,336 --> 00:37:19,826
Locke!

466
00:37:40,091 --> 00:37:42,719
l think what you did
was so kind.

467
00:37:47,064 --> 00:37:49,362
- Where's my father?
- Who?

468
00:37:49,433 --> 00:37:51,958
We had the transplant together.

469
00:37:53,070 --> 00:37:55,903
l didn't know
he was your father.

470
00:37:57,074 --> 00:37:59,406
We don't have
the same last name.

471
00:38:00,811 --> 00:38:04,907
- Where is he?
- Mr. Cooper checked out this afternoon.

472
00:38:04,982 --> 00:38:07,576
He went back home.
He's under private care.

473
00:38:07,652 --> 00:38:10,052
That doesn't make any...

474
00:38:10,121 --> 00:38:13,454
Wha... [gasps]

475
00:38:13,524 --> 00:38:16,322
- Did he leave me a message?
- No, not that l know of.

476
00:38:16,394 --> 00:38:19,830
You just relax, Mr. Locke.
l'm gonna get you some juice.

477
00:38:31,809 --> 00:38:34,505
[Emily] lt was his idea.

478
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:41,140
l'm sorry, John.

479
00:38:43,454 --> 00:38:45,718
What are you doing here?

480
00:38:46,791 --> 00:38:49,760
l needed some money.

481
00:38:49,827 --> 00:38:51,692
He's always been
good that way.

482
00:38:51,762 --> 00:38:55,425
Your father's always
been generous.

483
00:38:55,499 --> 00:38:57,558
You told me l didn't
have a father.

484
00:38:58,269 --> 00:39:01,432
He said that was the only way
you would give it to him.

485
00:39:01,505 --> 00:39:03,598
lt had to be your idea.

486
00:39:05,176 --> 00:39:06,939
He told me where to find you.

487
00:39:07,011 --> 00:39:09,206
He asked me to go see you.

488
00:39:11,082 --> 00:39:13,607
l wanted to see you.

489
00:39:15,953 --> 00:39:17,887
This can't be happening.

490
00:39:17,955 --> 00:39:21,083
This is a misunderstanding.

491
00:39:21,158 --> 00:39:23,649
This can't happen to me.

492
00:39:25,363 --> 00:39:27,456
He wouldn't do this to me.

493
00:39:34,872 --> 00:39:36,965
He wouldn't do this to me!

494
00:39:55,559 --> 00:39:56,548
Eddie!

495
00:39:57,628 --> 00:40:01,496
- Eddie, open the gate!
- Mr. Cooper's not seeing guests.

496
00:40:01,565 --> 00:40:04,363
- l'm not a guest.
- l'm sorry, John.

497
00:40:12,676 --> 00:40:15,270
Eddie, open the gate.

498
00:40:15,346 --> 00:40:18,372
l'm sorry. l'm gonna need you
to move your car.

499
00:40:30,361 --> 00:40:32,761
l know you're watching me.

500
00:40:36,367 --> 00:40:38,961
You can't do this.

501
00:40:39,036 --> 00:40:41,231
John, please.
Move your car.

502
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:54,611
[yelling]

503
00:40:59,690 --> 00:41:02,022
[yelling]

504
00:41:03,194 --> 00:41:05,321
[sobbing]

505
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:31,954
l've done everything
you wanted me to do.

506
00:41:32,022 --> 00:41:35,514
So why did you
do this to me?
