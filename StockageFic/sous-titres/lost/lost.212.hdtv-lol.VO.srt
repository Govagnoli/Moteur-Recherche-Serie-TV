1
00:00:00,812 --> 00:00:02,568
Previously on "Lost"...

2
00:00:04,341 --> 00:00:06,670
The plane was
loaded with heroin.

3
00:00:08,725 --> 00:00:11,402
- He said he found it in the jungle.
- Where in the jungle?

4
00:00:11,432 --> 00:00:13,903
- It's just a statue.
- Just a statue?

5
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:19,672
Where is Charlie?

6
00:00:19,998 --> 00:00:21,275
What's this?

7
00:00:21,461 --> 00:00:24,313
Because this was in
your little statue.

8
00:00:24,406 --> 00:00:25,684
I didn't know.

9
00:00:25,917 --> 00:00:29,915
Look, if it's sealed up inside a statue,
how would I know?

10
00:00:33,745 --> 00:00:36,693
- You lied to me, Charlie.
- I'm sorry.

11
00:00:36,781 --> 00:00:38,986
Look, I can't have you
around my baby, okay?

12
00:00:39,016 --> 00:00:39,445
Claire--

13
00:00:39,532 --> 00:00:44,340
Charlie, I don't want you
sleeping anywhere near us, okay?

14
00:01:28,109 --> 00:01:31,676
Voltron! Whoa!

15
00:01:35,770 --> 00:01:37,812
Where are my presents?

16
00:01:40,614 --> 00:01:42,274
Right over here, Charlie.

17
00:01:56,104 --> 00:01:57,289
It's a piano!

18
00:01:59,669 --> 00:02:00,852
This is mine?!

19
00:02:00,992 --> 00:02:01,935
Yes, Charlie.

20
00:02:02,121 --> 00:02:05,070
Father Christmas must have
known how talented you are.

21
00:02:09,819 --> 00:02:11,575
You're special, love.

22
00:02:11,994 --> 00:02:15,352
Someday you're gonna get us outta here,
all of us.

23
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:17,836
Now...

24
00:02:19,798 --> 00:02:22,461
go on, play us a tune.

25
00:02:23,945 --> 00:02:25,319
Come on, baby brother.

26
00:02:27,842 --> 00:02:30,364
You can't save your
family if you don't play.

27
00:02:32,884 --> 00:02:37,884
Come on, Charlie.
Play. Play me a tune.

28
00:02:38,163 --> 00:02:39,823
Come on, now. Let's hear it.

29
00:02:41,877 --> 00:02:45,734
He ain't savin' no one,
he is. Music...

30
00:02:45,824 --> 00:02:48,726
Music will never get you anywhere,
Charlie boy.

31
00:02:49,753 --> 00:02:52,062
- You need a trade.
- Dad?

32
00:02:53,276 --> 00:02:55,702
Do it, baby bro. Save us.

33
00:02:56,492 --> 00:03:00,251
Save us, Charlie. Save us.

34
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:21,688
Aaron?

35
00:03:23,417 --> 00:03:24,075
Aaron?

36
00:03:25,850 --> 00:03:26,459
Aaron!

37
00:03:29,407 --> 00:03:31,110
It's okay, Aaron.
It's all right.

38
00:03:44,333 --> 00:03:45,135
Aaron!

39
00:03:47,335 --> 00:03:48,132
Aaron!

40
00:04:05,441 --> 00:04:07,340
Sun. Hey, Sun!

41
00:04:07,571 --> 00:04:09,581
Have you seen Claire and the baby?
They're gone.

42
00:04:09,611 --> 00:04:10,890
They're right over there.

43
00:04:10,983 --> 00:04:14,217
- Is Aaron okay?
- Yes, he's fine. Charlie!

44
00:05:09,293 --> 00:05:10,139
It's okay.

45
00:05:16,026 --> 00:05:16,596
Hey.

46
00:05:20,001 --> 00:05:20,514
Hey.

47
00:05:21,308 --> 00:05:23,876
I made Aaron some
nappies this morning.

48
00:05:24,341 --> 00:05:26,957
I'll just put those there.

49
00:05:27,563 --> 00:05:29,229
Thanks.

50
00:05:34,175 --> 00:05:36,125
Has he been asking about me?

51
00:05:37,101 --> 00:05:39,716
Charlie, don't.

52
00:05:45,929 --> 00:05:47,019
I'm sorry.

53
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:50,039
I should have told
you about the statue

54
00:05:50,599 --> 00:05:52,072
and what was in it.

55
00:05:53,842 --> 00:05:57,124
I just wish things could get back
to the way they were before.

56
00:05:58,338 --> 00:06:00,762
There is no "before", Charlie.

57
00:06:02,403 --> 00:06:05,202
We were strangers on a plane,
and we became friends.

58
00:06:05,294 --> 00:06:07,191
Now Locke's your friend, huh?

59
00:06:13,488 --> 00:06:18,636
Please, Charlie, just for now,
give me some space, okay?

60
00:06:19,566 --> 00:06:21,798
Yeah. Space.

61
00:06:30,394 --> 00:06:31,242
See ya, mate.

62
00:06:32,131 --> 00:06:34,983
Take care of your
mum now, okay?

63
00:06:50,963 --> 00:06:52,670
- Charlie?
- Hey.

64
00:06:53,276 --> 00:06:55,508
- Hey. Hi.
- Hey.

65
00:06:55,649 --> 00:06:58,099
What are you doin' up?
You should be laying down.

66
00:06:58,677 --> 00:07:00,480
I just needed to see her again.

67
00:07:01,553 --> 00:07:03,405
Isn't she brilliant?

68
00:07:05,887 --> 00:07:07,922
She's beautiful, Karen.

69
00:07:08,909 --> 00:07:10,710
I named her Megan.

70
00:07:13,975 --> 00:07:15,636
Where's Liam?

71
00:07:19,514 --> 00:07:20,647
He's not here.

72
00:07:21,394 --> 00:07:23,044
Karen, look,
it wasn't his fault.

73
00:07:23,406 --> 00:07:26,259
We were leaving the club in dresden.
I was in a cab.

74
00:07:26,408 --> 00:07:28,166
He was in a van with the gear,

75
00:07:28,295 --> 00:07:30,729
and he blew a tire on
the way to the airport.

76
00:07:30,857 --> 00:07:32,470
He missed his flight,

77
00:07:32,621 --> 00:07:35,521
but he's on the next plane, all right?
He'll be here soon.

78
00:07:35,927 --> 00:07:37,015
But he's okay?

79
00:07:38,415 --> 00:07:41,317
He's great. He's a dad.

80
00:07:42,254 --> 00:07:42,918
Yeah.

81
00:08:02,253 --> 00:08:03,158
Oh, for the...

82
00:08:03,943 --> 00:08:04,982
Liam...

83
00:08:05,962 --> 00:08:07,108
Unbelievable.

84
00:08:08,698 --> 00:08:09,725
Liam?

85
00:08:12,957 --> 00:08:15,467
Liam, wake up! Hey!

86
00:08:16,447 --> 00:08:18,157
What the hell's wrong with you?

87
00:08:18,294 --> 00:08:19,694
What the hell are you doing?

88
00:08:19,901 --> 00:08:21,705
Hi, baby brother.

89
00:08:22,030 --> 00:08:24,692
You're supposed to be cleaning up.
Get up.

90
00:08:25,999 --> 00:08:27,799
I told Karen you
missed your flight.

91
00:08:27,988 --> 00:08:30,283
She's all alone at the hospital,
and you're here fixin'.

92
00:08:30,313 --> 00:08:32,254
- What's the matter with you?
- I'm cool, I'm cool, I'm cool.

93
00:08:32,284 --> 00:08:35,569
I just needed to get right,
that's all.

94
00:08:36,499 --> 00:08:38,637
Don't  worry. I left you some.

95
00:08:40,131 --> 00:08:43,033
"Get right"?
Why don't you get up?

96
00:08:43,546 --> 00:08:46,304
Take a shower, get dressed,
get to the hospital?

97
00:08:46,489 --> 00:08:49,964
All right, all right, I'm on it.
I'm on it.

98
00:08:50,863 --> 00:08:54,335
Oh, by the way,
you have a daughter.

99
00:08:56,522 --> 00:08:57,603
Her name is Megan.

100
00:09:00,403 --> 00:09:01,730
After mum?

101
00:09:03,737 --> 00:09:05,445
Yeah, after mum.

102
00:09:06,518 --> 00:09:09,945
Now clean yourself up.
You're a sodding father now.

103
00:09:12,046 --> 00:09:15,043
Easy. That's good.
That was good.

104
00:09:15,327 --> 00:09:16,697
Okay, one more.

105
00:09:16,881 --> 00:09:20,547
Uh, Sawyer, when you were
over there across the island,

106
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,733
how well did you get
to know those tailies?

107
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:25,663
Well enough, why?

108
00:09:25,848 --> 00:09:28,904
That Libby chick
seems pretty cool.

109
00:09:30,574 --> 00:09:33,285
I mean, is she?

110
00:09:33,518 --> 00:09:37,375
Whoa, you got a little love
connection brewin' over there, Jabba?

111
00:09:37,942 --> 00:09:41,798
- No, just askin'.
- Yeah, I hear you askin'.

112
00:09:43,332 --> 00:09:44,609
Forget it.

113
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:50,170
What's with you? You're acting
like you're in junior high.

114
00:09:56,835 --> 00:09:58,448
Well, what do we have here?

115
00:09:58,633 --> 00:10:01,487
Looks like Ana Lucia's
gettin' the $20 tour.

116
00:10:01,814 --> 00:10:05,047
That's  the third time I've seen
'em walkin' out of the jungle.

117
00:10:08,458 --> 00:10:10,691
What do you suppose
they're doin' out there?

118
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:13,207
Why don't you just do
your exercises, Sawyer?

119
00:10:19,608 --> 00:10:21,270
Oh, bloody hell.

120
00:10:35,132 --> 00:10:35,834
Hey!

121
00:10:37,002 --> 00:10:39,856
Hey! The baby!

122
00:10:42,185 --> 00:10:43,033
Help!

123
00:10:45,434 --> 00:10:46,416
Help!

124
00:10:47,341 --> 00:10:48,476
The baby!

125
00:10:59,366 --> 00:10:59,989
Aaron!

126
00:11:09,416 --> 00:11:10,169
Aaron!

127
00:11:12,878 --> 00:11:14,740
I'm coming! I'm coming, Aaron!

128
00:11:15,204 --> 00:11:16,093
It's okay.

129
00:11:17,914 --> 00:11:18,764
It's okay.

130
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:21,452
You're safe now.

131
00:11:30,648 --> 00:11:34,744
I got you. It's all right.
It's okay. You're okay now.

132
00:11:35,583 --> 00:11:38,008
You're safe. You're safe.

133
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:40,612
There you go. It's okay.

134
00:11:46,432 --> 00:11:47,377
Mum?

135
00:11:49,198 --> 00:11:49,910
C laire?

136
00:11:50,698 --> 00:11:52,913
He's in danger.
You have to save him.

137
00:11:53,013 --> 00:11:55,457
The baby's in danger. You have to
save the baby. You have to save him.

138
00:11:55,487 --> 00:12:00,001
The baby is in danger.
The baby, Charlie. You have to save him.

139
00:12:00,139 --> 00:12:02,992
Charlie, only you can save him.
You have to save him.

140
00:12:11,122 --> 00:12:11,924
Charlie?

141
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:14,558
What are you doing?

142
00:12:15,398 --> 00:12:16,295
What?

143
00:12:16,486 --> 00:12:17,949
What are you doing, man?

144
00:12:18,931 --> 00:12:20,116
What's goin' on?

145
00:12:20,676 --> 00:12:23,825
It's the middle of the night.
What are you doing with the baby?

146
00:12:30,952 --> 00:12:32,230
I don't know.

147
00:12:34,006 --> 00:12:35,716
Help! Somebody stole my baby!

148
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:37,535
- Claire, what's wrong?
- I don't know! Aaron's gone!

149
00:12:37,565 --> 00:12:40,286
It's okay! We're over here!

150
00:12:41,674 --> 00:12:42,948
Is he all right?!

151
00:12:43,319 --> 00:12:44,932
- Is he okay?!
- Claire...

152
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:49,283
I don't know what happened.
I'm sorry.

153
00:12:53,956 --> 00:12:55,142
He's okay, though.

154
00:12:55,746 --> 00:12:56,787
I had this dream--

155
00:13:15,591 --> 00:13:16,392
Stick?

156
00:13:17,187 --> 00:13:20,287
I don't know, dude. Don't you need 21?
I think you should hit.

157
00:13:20,784 --> 00:13:22,731
But I got a six.
I'm gonna bust.

158
00:13:23,104 --> 00:13:24,383
How do you know that?

159
00:13:24,568 --> 00:13:28,238
Well, I don't, but you gotta
assume that I'm gonna bust.

160
00:13:28,467 --> 00:13:29,316
Why?

161
00:13:35,950 --> 00:13:39,050
Well, well,
look who's off to the laundromat.

162
00:13:41,426 --> 00:13:42,629
Well, go on.

163
00:13:44,338 --> 00:13:48,684
I'm sure you've got a load you need
to drop in, don't you, Jethro?

164
00:13:48,765 --> 00:13:51,531
I'm kind of waitin'
for my moment.

165
00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:53,836
Well...

166
00:13:55,424 --> 00:13:59,118
your moment is now, Hoss.

167
00:14:00,333 --> 00:14:01,450
Hey, Libby!

168
00:14:08,785 --> 00:14:10,104
Hey, yourself.

169
00:14:25,097 --> 00:14:28,524
Hey, John.
Talk to you for a second?

170
00:14:29,130 --> 00:14:30,505
Yeah. What is it, Charlie?

171
00:14:31,205 --> 00:14:33,755
I take it you heard about
what happened last night?

172
00:14:34,046 --> 00:14:38,046
If you mean you taking the baby out of
Claire's tent in the middle of
the night,

173
00:14:38,221 --> 00:14:39,493
yeah, I heard.

174
00:14:39,632 --> 00:14:42,882
This whole thing was a big
misunderstanding, John. I
was sleepwalking.

175
00:14:42,912 --> 00:14:44,191
I don't know how or why--

176
00:14:44,302 --> 00:14:46,636
Is there something you
want from me, Charlie?

177
00:14:46,852 --> 00:14:49,009
I was hoping you could
speak to Claire for me,

178
00:14:49,039 --> 00:14:51,022
you know, put in a good word.

179
00:14:51,635 --> 00:14:55,392
- Are you using?
- What?

180
00:14:55,542 --> 00:14:57,573
Heroin. Are you using again?

181
00:14:58,927 --> 00:15:02,163
Kate sees a horse-- nothing.

182
00:15:02,489 --> 00:15:05,220
Pretty much everybody's seen
Walt wandering round the jungle.

183
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:07,827
But when it's Charlie,
it must be the bloody drugs, right?

184
00:15:07,857 --> 00:15:10,007
It's funny,
you didn't answer the question.

185
00:15:10,814 --> 00:15:12,906
You remember the plane, John?

186
00:15:13,324 --> 00:15:16,274
We burned it, Eko and me.

187
00:15:16,413 --> 00:15:22,132
We burned the whole thing-- the heroin,
the statues. It's all gone, destroyed.

188
00:15:23,018 --> 00:15:25,682
- All of them?
- All of them.

189
00:15:31,067 --> 00:15:34,959
Trust is a hard
thing to win back.

190
00:15:35,192 --> 00:15:36,760
Claire needs time.

191
00:15:37,926 --> 00:15:40,779
You should leave her and
the baby alone for a while.

192
00:16:00,692 --> 00:16:01,935
Can you do this?

193
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,099
You look green.

194
00:16:03,351 --> 00:16:05,683
Sod off. I'm fine.

195
00:16:05,829 --> 00:16:08,146
All right,
let's give this another go, shall we?

196
00:16:08,176 --> 00:16:11,376
Well, get it together, all right?
Lest you forget, we need this.

197
00:16:11,899 --> 00:16:15,613
Tea? So you lads ready?

198
00:16:15,891 --> 00:16:17,648
Yeah, we're ready. Let's go.

199
00:16:17,787 --> 00:16:19,534
Let's try not to blow
it this time, eh?

200
00:16:19,564 --> 00:16:20,064
Thank you.

201
00:16:20,196 --> 00:16:21,214
- You good?
- Yeah.

202
00:16:21,363 --> 00:16:24,513
We've only 20 minutes till we're
in overtime. Now get it right.

203
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:33,293
All right...

204
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:35,503
Camera...

205
00:16:36,057 --> 00:16:37,479
Rotate on the 8-count.

206
00:16:37,693 --> 00:16:41,267
Hold the product up.
"Butties diapers, take 53.."

207
00:16:41,149 --> 00:16:41,693
Playback.

208
00:16:42,908 --> 00:16:44,765
And action!

209
00:17:03,551 --> 00:17:04,370
Cut!

210
00:17:05,664 --> 00:17:06,510
It's all right.

211
00:17:06,649 --> 00:17:08,739
That's it. We're wrapped!

212
00:17:09,076 --> 00:17:11,919
Wait, no!
Oi, mate, hang on! Wait.

213
00:17:13,089 --> 00:17:14,081
Wait.

214
00:17:14,266 --> 00:17:15,449
What are you doing?

215
00:17:15,681 --> 00:17:17,681
Let's not waste any more time,
shall we?

216
00:17:17,816 --> 00:17:19,923
You were only hired as
a favor to your lawyer.

217
00:17:19,953 --> 00:17:21,420
I wanted Dirt Spigot.

218
00:17:21,934 --> 00:17:24,405
Come on, mate.
Give us another chance.

219
00:17:24,638 --> 00:17:26,824
You want another chance?
Take my advice--

220
00:17:27,151 --> 00:17:30,582
ditch that one.
He's a bloody disaster.

221
00:17:33,381 --> 00:17:36,999
I'm not ditchin' anyone.
He's my brother.

222
00:17:37,541 --> 00:17:41,255
Right. Well, then,
I guess you're fired.

223
00:17:43,075 --> 00:17:47,506
Is this washer and dryer newer
than everything else in here?

224
00:17:47,645 --> 00:17:49,774
It washes clothes.
That's all I need to know.

225
00:17:49,804 --> 00:17:53,499
Ah, finally.
Someone who keeps it simple.

226
00:17:54,053 --> 00:17:56,525
Oh, hey, look at this.

227
00:17:56,721 --> 00:17:59,518
I got it in some of
the abandoned luggage.

228
00:18:00,425 --> 00:18:03,037
You think I can pull this off?

229
00:18:05,644 --> 00:18:11,072
Let me give you a hint-- uh,
when a girl asks that kind of question,

230
00:18:11,182 --> 00:18:13,139
she's looking for validation.

231
00:18:14,784 --> 00:18:18,200
Do I...
know you from somewhere?

232
00:18:20,505 --> 00:18:22,579
You mean other than the flight?

233
00:18:23,616 --> 00:18:24,409
Flight...

234
00:18:24,703 --> 00:18:26,683
- Okay, turn around.
- Huh?

235
00:18:26,877 --> 00:18:29,582
Turn around. I wanna try it on.
Turn around.

236
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:31,634
Oh. Oh, sure, yeah. Go ahead.

237
00:18:31,712 --> 00:18:32,568
No peeking.

238
00:18:37,816 --> 00:18:41,748
I cannot believe you don't
remember stepping on my foot.

239
00:18:41,955 --> 00:18:42,545
I did?

240
00:18:42,742 --> 00:18:45,079
Yes, you did, and it was hard.

241
00:18:45,199 --> 00:18:48,779
I know that because I remember you
were the last one on the flight,

242
00:18:48,936 --> 00:18:52,958
and you were all sweaty,
and you had headphones on and...

243
00:18:53,237 --> 00:18:57,383
crunch! You stepped on my foot.

244
00:18:57,707 --> 00:18:59,098
Okay, turn around.

245
00:19:05,931 --> 00:19:09,132
- What do you think?
- It's awesome.

246
00:19:11,269 --> 00:19:12,071
Thanks.

247
00:19:20,718 --> 00:19:22,162
What are you doing?

248
00:19:23,495 --> 00:19:24,766
I'm marking trees.

249
00:19:26,998 --> 00:19:27,847
Why?

250
00:19:31,045 --> 00:19:32,637
'Cause these...

251
00:19:33,104 --> 00:19:34,860
are the ones I like.

252
00:19:37,852 --> 00:19:41,102
Did you tell Locke you gave me
one of the statues from the plane?

253
00:19:41,133 --> 00:19:42,890
Why would I do that?

254
00:19:43,636 --> 00:19:45,202
He knows, man.

255
00:19:45,968 --> 00:19:47,813
The bald wanker
knows something.

256
00:19:50,137 --> 00:19:51,800
Something wrong, Charlie?

257
00:19:52,059 --> 00:19:55,104
Apart from me losing my mind,
no, everything's just peachy.

258
00:19:55,225 --> 00:19:57,814
And why would you say
you are losing your mind?

259
00:19:58,093 --> 00:20:00,565
How about the fact that
I've been sleepwalking,

260
00:20:00,751 --> 00:20:03,619
stealin' babies
from their cribs...

261
00:20:04,445 --> 00:20:06,436
Oh, yeah,
and then there's the vivid dreams

262
00:20:06,466 --> 00:20:09,143
that make me feel like I'm
completely awake until of course,

263
00:20:09,173 --> 00:20:10,644
I wake up.

264
00:20:14,382 --> 00:20:16,425
What are your dreams about?

265
00:20:17,421 --> 00:20:20,833
Variations  of Aaron
being in mortal peril...

266
00:20:21,454 --> 00:20:26,323
trapped in a piano,
driftin' out to sea...

267
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:30,488
and there's the flying dove and
Claire and my mom dressed as angels

268
00:20:30,643 --> 00:20:33,005
tellin' me I need
to save the baby.

269
00:20:37,694 --> 00:20:38,289
What?

270
00:20:41,213 --> 00:20:45,399
Have you considered that
these dreams mean something?

271
00:20:46,695 --> 00:20:47,896
Like what?

272
00:20:48,854 --> 00:20:51,656
What if you do need
to save the baby?

273
00:20:58,874 --> 00:21:00,749
I have to talk to her.

274
00:21:00,834 --> 00:21:02,381
You know,
now's not a good time, okay?

275
00:21:02,411 --> 00:21:03,993
No, I have to talk to her.
She'll want to hear this.

276
00:21:04,023 --> 00:21:05,562
Okay, you know what?
Tell me, and I will tell her.

277
00:21:05,592 --> 00:21:06,862
Kate-- no, no! Claire!

278
00:21:07,331 --> 00:21:11,154
Claire, listen to me.
Aaron's in danger.

279
00:21:11,238 --> 00:21:13,288
- What are you talking about?
- The baby's in danger!

280
00:21:13,318 --> 00:21:15,549
Look,  I've been having these dreams.
I know what they mean now.

281
00:21:15,579 --> 00:21:16,365
- Charlie--
- Kate!

282
00:21:16,395 --> 00:21:19,400
Claire, listen,
we have to baptize Aaron.

283
00:21:19,629 --> 00:21:20,140
What?

284
00:21:20,364 --> 00:21:22,487
We can do this.
Eko's a priest. We can do this.

285
00:21:22,517 --> 00:21:24,142
You've said your piece.
It's time for you to go.

286
00:21:24,172 --> 00:21:27,172
No, wait! I'm not leaving.
Claire, we have to baptize Aaron!

287
00:21:27,379 --> 00:21:31,092
Claire, he's in danger.
We've got to do this! We have to!

288
00:21:50,596 --> 00:21:53,564
Here. For when it rains.

289
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:55,287
Thanks.

290
00:22:08,598 --> 00:22:12,451
So when are you gonna tell me
what happened in the jungle?

291
00:22:12,774 --> 00:22:16,353
I already did.
Pull it tighter or it'll sag.

292
00:22:20,088 --> 00:22:22,535
You told me what that guy said.

293
00:22:23,583 --> 00:22:25,914
You didn't tell me what
made you turn around,

294
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:28,511
what made you come back.

295
00:22:29,082 --> 00:22:31,138
He had a gun at Kate's head.

296
00:22:36,298 --> 00:22:38,132
You hittin' that?

297
00:22:39,738 --> 00:22:40,778
What?

298
00:22:41,072 --> 00:22:43,882
Plane crash...
you both survived...

299
00:22:44,332 --> 00:22:46,261
nice beach...

300
00:22:46,774 --> 00:22:50,107
she's hot, you're hot.
It's what people do.

301
00:22:52,747 --> 00:22:54,273
I'm not "hittin' that."

302
00:24:22,581 --> 00:24:23,438
Hey.

303
00:24:27,402 --> 00:24:29,398
Karen kicked me out, man.

304
00:24:31,301 --> 00:24:32,167
What?

305
00:24:36,399 --> 00:24:37,665
What happened?

306
00:24:38,081 --> 00:24:39,471
She, uh...

307
00:24:40,125 --> 00:24:41,883
she thinks I'm dangerous.

308
00:24:45,433 --> 00:24:47,620
Why would she think that?

309
00:24:48,790 --> 00:24:51,311
Because I dropped her.

310
00:24:51,728 --> 00:24:53,415
I dropped Megan.

311
00:24:54,978 --> 00:24:55,640
Oh.

312
00:24:57,759 --> 00:24:59,129
Hey, Liam.

313
00:24:59,723 --> 00:25:00,951
It's all right.

314
00:25:01,558 --> 00:25:05,111
I've got no money, got nothin'.

315
00:25:06,343 --> 00:25:08,150
What are we gonna do?

316
00:25:08,427 --> 00:25:12,131
- We'll get through this.
- Yeah? How's that?

317
00:25:13,076 --> 00:25:15,225
I'm writin' again.

318
00:25:15,727 --> 00:25:17,340
I got a new song.

319
00:25:18,324 --> 00:25:19,865
It's about two brothers.

320
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:21,650
Two  brothers who
should've been butchers.

321
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:23,964
Don't say that.
It's a good one.

322
00:25:24,199 --> 00:25:26,147
I feel like this
might be the one.

323
00:25:26,283 --> 00:25:28,547
All right,
listen to this, okay?

324
00:26:15,507 --> 00:26:16,805
Nice, man.

325
00:26:17,188 --> 00:26:18,393
This could work.

326
00:26:18,468 --> 00:26:20,618
- It's good, right?
- We could make it work.

327
00:26:20,846 --> 00:26:22,752
Write all night,
just like the old days.

328
00:26:22,782 --> 00:26:25,409
- All right.
- How about that?

329
00:26:26,498 --> 00:26:28,527
So, baby brother...

330
00:26:29,913 --> 00:26:31,682
do you got any?

331
00:26:36,169 --> 00:26:38,180
I'm disappointed
in you, Charlie.

332
00:26:41,611 --> 00:26:43,095
You followed me?

333
00:26:43,253 --> 00:26:44,953
How long you been
comin' out here?

334
00:26:46,187 --> 00:26:48,422
John, you got the
wrong idea, man.

335
00:26:48,581 --> 00:26:51,993
You said you destroyed them all, and
yet, here they are. How is that the
wrong idea?

336
00:26:52,023 --> 00:26:53,556
I came out here to
finish the job.

337
00:26:53,586 --> 00:26:55,070
I'm gonna get rid
of these right now.

338
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:57,800
Yeah, that's very convenient
now that I've found them.

339
00:26:58,345 --> 00:26:59,768
What are you doing?

340
00:26:59,936 --> 00:27:03,617
There was a time when I let
you choose whether or not

341
00:27:03,729 --> 00:27:06,154
you were gonna do
this to yourself.

342
00:27:08,210 --> 00:27:10,074
Now I'm making that
choice for you.

343
00:27:10,248 --> 00:27:12,339
Oh, you don't believe me?
Give 'em to me.

344
00:27:12,479 --> 00:27:14,929
Give 'em to me right now.
I'll destroy 'em. Look!

345
00:27:15,181 --> 00:27:17,281
I'll throw 'em in
the sodding wind!

346
00:27:17,459 --> 00:27:19,762
Look, John,
I know I lied, all right?

347
00:27:19,973 --> 00:27:22,254
Just wait. Wait, wait, John.

348
00:27:22,347 --> 00:27:23,947
Remember all those
talks we had?

349
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:29,108
You and me,
we said everything happens for a reason.

350
00:27:29,337 --> 00:27:31,141
This island tests us.

351
00:27:31,475 --> 00:27:33,191
That's what this is, John--

352
00:27:33,316 --> 00:27:35,866
A test. This is my test.
That's why these are here.

353
00:27:35,963 --> 00:27:37,887
These are here because
you put 'em here, Charlie.

354
00:27:37,917 --> 00:27:39,799
No, wait. John, wait.

355
00:27:41,524 --> 00:27:43,258
What are you gonna do?

356
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:45,574
You gonna tell Claire?

357
00:27:45,853 --> 00:27:48,660
You can't.
Look, if she sees them, I'm done.

358
00:27:48,802 --> 00:27:51,302
She'll never trust me again,
and she has to, John.

359
00:27:51,407 --> 00:27:54,349
It's about the baby, all right?

360
00:27:54,455 --> 00:27:56,310
Aaron's in danger.

361
00:27:58,143 --> 00:28:00,193
You have to believe me.

362
00:28:00,998 --> 00:28:03,820
You've given up the right
to be believed, Charlie.

363
00:28:19,582 --> 00:28:20,616
Hey.

364
00:28:21,022 --> 00:28:23,470
Hi. How's our boy?

365
00:28:23,890 --> 00:28:25,321
Oh, he's good.

366
00:28:27,883 --> 00:28:29,653
Hey, John,
can I ask you something?

367
00:28:29,893 --> 00:28:30,333
Sure.

368
00:28:31,128 --> 00:28:32,646
Do you think, uh,

369
00:28:32,899 --> 00:28:36,563
Aaron and I could stay in the
bedroom in the hatch for a while?

370
00:28:40,366 --> 00:28:42,816
Pretty loud alarm goes
off every hour and a half.

371
00:28:42,943 --> 00:28:45,859
It's not the best place for a
baby to sleep through the night.

372
00:28:45,889 --> 00:28:47,890
Oh, yeah, sure.

373
00:28:52,373 --> 00:28:54,813
How about if I move my stuff
down here for a couple nights?

374
00:28:54,843 --> 00:28:57,200
Set up right next to your tent?

375
00:28:57,722 --> 00:29:00,593
That would be great. Thanks.

376
00:29:01,384 --> 00:29:03,308
Yeah, consider it done.

377
00:29:05,321 --> 00:29:07,311
Hey, John, you don't...

378
00:29:07,386 --> 00:29:10,216
you don't know anything about baptism,
do you?

379
00:29:10,358 --> 00:29:12,217
Not a whole lot. Why?

380
00:29:13,423 --> 00:29:16,193
Charlie came by my
tent before and...

381
00:29:17,724 --> 00:29:20,007
he told me Aaron had
to be baptized...

382
00:29:23,492 --> 00:29:25,828
that he was in danger.

383
00:29:28,664 --> 00:29:33,339
My understanding is that baptism is
about making sure that children get
into heaven,

384
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:36,302
should anything happen.

385
00:29:38,078 --> 00:29:40,184
Call it "spiritual insurance."

386
00:29:43,535 --> 00:29:47,298
There isn't any danger, Claire.
Charlie just...

387
00:29:54,186 --> 00:29:56,833
Charlie just feels like
he has to save the baby

388
00:29:57,452 --> 00:29:59,416
'cause he can't save himself.

389
00:30:03,085 --> 00:30:05,057
- I'll see you tonight.
- Okay.

390
00:30:53,084 --> 00:30:56,028
Charlie, can you
give us a hand?

391
00:30:56,192 --> 00:30:58,572
Now's not a good time, Sayid.

392
00:30:59,294 --> 00:31:00,523
Let's lift this.

393
00:31:01,684 --> 00:31:02,914
Okay, I got it.

394
00:31:12,310 --> 00:31:15,488
Fire! Fire!

395
00:31:15,591 --> 00:31:18,807
Grab tools, containers for sand,
anything you have.

396
00:31:18,899 --> 00:31:21,849
If we don't stop it now,
it'll burn right through the camp!

397
00:31:24,863 --> 00:31:26,471
Stay here with Aaron.

398
00:31:32,046 --> 00:31:35,229
We need to cut a fire break right here!
Form a bucket line!

399
00:31:35,414 --> 00:31:37,314
Some of you people,
down to the water!

400
00:31:37,847 --> 00:31:39,071
Sawyer!

401
00:31:40,331 --> 00:31:42,364
We'll hand 'em up. Wait here!

402
00:32:14,258 --> 00:32:15,175
Liam?!

403
00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:19,442
My piano.

404
00:32:20,966 --> 00:32:23,968
What's... what's going on?

405
00:32:25,622 --> 00:32:29,221
Liam, where's my piano?

406
00:32:29,707 --> 00:32:32,659
- I sold it.
- You what?

407
00:32:34,948 --> 00:32:37,202
- Hey, wait, come on.
- Get off of me.

408
00:32:37,276 --> 00:32:39,801
Where's the money?
Is it up your soddin' arm?!

409
00:32:39,949 --> 00:32:42,461
I'm clean.
I haven't used in two days.

410
00:32:42,612 --> 00:32:45,372
Two days?
Well, happy anniversary!

411
00:32:45,450 --> 00:32:46,838
Well, how long you been clean?

412
00:32:46,868 --> 00:32:47,910
Where's the money?

413
00:32:48,749 --> 00:32:52,368
She was gonna leave me, Charlie.
She was gonna take Megan.

414
00:32:53,164 --> 00:32:54,781
What did you do, Liam?

415
00:32:54,941 --> 00:32:56,768
Karen's got an
uncle in Australia.

416
00:32:57,051 --> 00:33:00,486
He's gonna get me a job.
There's a rehab clinic in Sydney.

417
00:33:00,658 --> 00:33:02,949
I just needed the
money to get us there.

418
00:33:04,863 --> 00:33:06,656
I have to do this.

419
00:33:06,945 --> 00:33:11,229
I have to take care of myself,
for them, for my family.

420
00:33:14,140 --> 00:33:16,021
I'm your family!

421
00:33:16,461 --> 00:33:20,634
- Wait. Will you just wait?
- I can't, Charlie.

422
00:33:20,746 --> 00:33:23,126
What about the band?
What about the song?

423
00:33:26,678 --> 00:33:30,014
Try to understand,
I have to go.

424
00:33:30,174 --> 00:33:31,718
I have to.

425
00:33:31,993 --> 00:33:36,949
Look, I'll give you a call when
things settle down for me.

426
00:33:37,322 --> 00:33:39,039
For you? What about me?

427
00:33:39,492 --> 00:33:41,213
What about my family?

428
00:33:42,224 --> 00:33:44,185
What about my family?!

429
00:34:13,812 --> 00:34:15,807
Charlie! What are you doing?!

430
00:34:15,883 --> 00:34:17,181
I'm doing what I have to do!

431
00:34:17,211 --> 00:34:20,670
- He's got my baby! Stop it!
- No! Claire, it's all right!

432
00:34:20,847 --> 00:34:22,855
- Charlie, stop!
- It's not... no! I...

433
00:34:23,029 --> 00:34:27,842
Help! Help! Somebody help!
He's got my baby! Help! Help!

434
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:31,039
Come on, Charlie,
please, stop it.

435
00:34:31,222 --> 00:34:32,907
I just want to save him!

436
00:34:33,004 --> 00:34:34,574
Charlie! It's all right.

437
00:34:37,201 --> 00:34:38,759
Give me the baby.

438
00:34:42,915 --> 00:34:45,559
Eko, tell them! Tell them, Eko!

439
00:34:45,671 --> 00:34:48,721
Tell them what you told me,
that the baby has to be baptized!

440
00:34:48,903 --> 00:34:50,613
This is not the way.

441
00:34:52,506 --> 00:34:55,684
Charlie... come on,
give him to me.

442
00:34:56,055 --> 00:34:57,968
Who the hell are you, John?!

443
00:34:58,014 --> 00:34:59,967
Aaron's not
your responsibility!

444
00:35:00,292 --> 00:35:01,897
Where were you
when he was born?!

445
00:35:01,927 --> 00:35:03,968
Where were you when
he was taken?!

446
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:07,207
You're not his father.
You're not his family!

447
00:35:08,119 --> 00:35:10,352
Neither are you, Charlie.

448
00:35:15,374 --> 00:35:18,209
I have to do this, I need to.

449
00:35:18,549 --> 00:35:20,949
I'm not gonna hurt him.

450
00:35:21,755 --> 00:35:23,709
You're hurting me, Charlie.

451
00:35:54,006 --> 00:35:54,757
Claire.

452
00:35:57,178 --> 00:35:58,029
I'm sorry--

453
00:36:44,087 --> 00:36:45,551
You need stitches.

454
00:37:00,023 --> 00:37:01,599
- Try to be still.
- Yeah.

455
00:37:13,552 --> 00:37:15,363
I started the fire, Jack.

456
00:37:17,145 --> 00:37:18,527
Yeah, I know.

457
00:37:20,999 --> 00:37:22,800
I was desperate. She didn't--

458
00:37:22,969 --> 00:37:27,306
I need to know you're never gonna
do anything like this again, ever.

459
00:37:28,847 --> 00:37:30,882
I know what this looks like,

460
00:37:31,181 --> 00:37:33,024
what people think.

461
00:37:33,518 --> 00:37:35,893
It doesn't matter now, but...

462
00:37:36,170 --> 00:37:38,026
I didn't use.

463
00:37:40,259 --> 00:37:42,334
I wanted to.

464
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:44,811
I really wanted to.

465
00:37:46,878 --> 00:37:48,853
But I didn't.

466
00:37:51,386 --> 00:37:54,086
That's not what
I asked, Charlie.

467
00:37:55,463 --> 00:37:57,607
It's not gonna happen again.

468
00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:45,387
Charlie told me
you're a priest.

469
00:38:47,506 --> 00:38:48,129
Yes.

470
00:38:49,765 --> 00:38:52,105
He said that you told
him that I had to have--

471
00:38:52,187 --> 00:38:55,409
I did not tell Charlie
to do what he did.

472
00:38:55,694 --> 00:38:58,416
I'm sorry if he misunderstood.

473
00:39:01,979 --> 00:39:06,274
But do you think the
baby has to be baptized?

474
00:39:06,562 --> 00:39:09,753
Do you know what baptism is?

475
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:12,505
It's what gets you into heaven.

476
00:39:16,890 --> 00:39:21,251
It is said that when John
the Baptist baptized Jesus,

477
00:39:21,377 --> 00:39:26,238
the skies opened up,
and a dove flew down from the sky.

478
00:39:26,610 --> 00:39:29,333
This told John something--

479
00:39:29,514 --> 00:39:32,489
that he had cleansed this
man of all his sins,

480
00:39:32,655 --> 00:39:34,760
that he had freed him.

481
00:39:37,169 --> 00:39:39,403
Heaven came much later.

482
00:39:41,367 --> 00:39:43,981
I haven't been baptized.

483
00:39:46,069 --> 00:39:49,410
And does that mean that if
you do it to Aaron, and

484
00:39:49,510 --> 00:39:54,111
something happened to us,
that we wouldn't be together?

485
00:39:58,388 --> 00:40:01,487
Not if I baptize you both.
