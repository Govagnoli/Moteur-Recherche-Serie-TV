1
00:00:01,004 --> 00:00:02,815
Previously on "Lost"...

2
00:00:02,908 --> 00:00:03,904
Jason.

3
00:00:08,462 --> 00:00:10,549
These people are smart.

4
00:00:11,063 --> 00:00:12,970
And they're animals,

5
00:00:13,063 --> 00:00:15,925
and if you think that
one gun and one bullet

6
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:17,781
is gonna stop them,

7
00:00:18,765 --> 00:00:20,623
think again.

8
00:00:21,419 --> 00:00:25,049
I'm going after my son,
and nobody is going to stop me, okay?

9
00:00:25,236 --> 00:00:26,186
I'll come with you.

10
00:00:26,276 --> 00:00:27,942
No. I have to do it alone.

11
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:30,532
I'm going out to the line that
we're not supposed to cross

12
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:33,473
and telling them
that we've got you.

13
00:00:33,753 --> 00:00:35,707
They'll never give you Walt.

14
00:00:43,445 --> 00:00:44,680
Michael.

15
00:00:46,632 --> 00:00:47,579
Michael.

16
00:00:49,829 --> 00:00:51,111
Michael.

17
00:00:52,143 --> 00:00:53,617
What's wrong with him?

18
00:00:53,758 --> 00:00:56,142
Michael. Michael?

19
00:00:56,469 --> 00:00:57,369
Michael.

20
00:01:00,821 --> 00:01:02,824
Jack? Where are you going?

21
00:01:02,916 --> 00:01:04,487
Maybe they just let him go.

22
00:01:05,753 --> 00:01:07,657
Let him go-- he's alone!

23
00:01:07,796 --> 00:01:11,571
They didn't just push him out into
the jungle, Jack. He's alone!

24
00:01:16,213 --> 00:01:17,304
Okay.

25
00:01:18,382 --> 00:01:19,809
Let's go.

26
00:01:58,416 --> 00:01:59,652
See ya, Ana Lucia.

27
00:02:05,513 --> 00:02:09,030
- You look tired.
- Yeah, thanks.

28
00:02:11,186 --> 00:02:12,038
What?

29
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,651
Where were you last night?

30
00:02:14,887 --> 00:02:16,932
- Home.
- All night?

31
00:02:17,288 --> 00:02:20,679
Yeah. Cooked myself some dinner,
watched some tv.

32
00:02:20,819 --> 00:02:22,247
What'd you watch?

33
00:02:26,606 --> 00:02:28,225
Let's go for a drive.

34
00:02:34,086 --> 00:02:36,424
Remember Jason Alder?

35
00:02:38,206 --> 00:02:41,387
Found him in a parking lot just
after 3:00 in the morning.

36
00:02:41,528 --> 00:02:44,151
He was dead an hour
before anyone saw him.

37
00:02:44,292 --> 00:02:46,442
Crime scene pulled a
gun from the dumpster.

38
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:50,061
Registration was filed off--
no prints, no witnesses.

39
00:02:50,201 --> 00:02:51,821
He was executed.

40
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:55,000
Any idea who did it?

41
00:02:55,890 --> 00:02:58,657
Yeah, Ana. You did.

42
00:02:59,078 --> 00:03:01,559
This man confesses to
shooting you in cold blood,

43
00:03:01,699 --> 00:03:04,995
and you refuse to I.D.
him, so we had to cut him loose.

44
00:03:05,275 --> 00:03:07,675
A week later, he shows up with
five bullets in his chest,

45
00:03:07,705 --> 00:03:09,946
because someone shot
him in cold blood.

46
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:13,795
Guess I should get a lawyer.

47
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:18,569
Look, we both know that this is
gonna be a dead-end investigation.

48
00:03:18,754 --> 00:03:21,283
But, Ana, if you did this...

49
00:03:21,471 --> 00:03:24,575
if you did this,
you have to let me help you.

50
00:03:24,901 --> 00:03:27,286
Yeah, thanks, mom,
but I don't need your help.

51
00:03:27,425 --> 00:03:31,105
You don't want my help? You're gonna
have to get it from somewhere else.

52
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:35,749
You're a police officer, Ana.

53
00:03:37,951 --> 00:03:41,725
If you don't respect me,
at least respect that.

54
00:03:48,432 --> 00:03:49,859
Then I quit.

55
00:04:03,441 --> 00:04:07,364
Hey, Henry. What do you say?

56
00:04:09,938 --> 00:04:13,328
How long you gonna keep up
this hunger strike, Henry?

57
00:04:20,246 --> 00:04:23,111
Did I ever tell
you I was a cop?

58
00:04:25,643 --> 00:04:28,846
I've been around a lot
of killers in my life.

59
00:04:29,402 --> 00:04:32,170
You know what surprises
me the most about 'em?

60
00:04:34,329 --> 00:04:37,434
How much they love to talk.

61
00:04:39,917 --> 00:04:42,830
But you're different... Henry.

62
00:04:44,376 --> 00:04:45,227
Hmm?

63
00:04:46,587 --> 00:04:47,591
Quiet.

64
00:04:54,101 --> 00:04:55,815
What was that?

65
00:05:00,242 --> 00:05:03,681
If you're gonna say something,
you're gonna have to speak--

66
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:13,179
You killed two of us--

67
00:05:13,319 --> 00:05:15,944
Good people who were
leaving you alone.

68
00:05:20,869 --> 00:05:24,885
You're the killer, Ana Lucia.

69
00:05:43,268 --> 00:05:46,381
I guess he decided to
start talking, huh?

70
00:06:24,729 --> 00:06:27,306
Hey, Mike. Tequila and tonic.

71
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:29,110
Long day, huh?

72
00:06:32,065 --> 00:06:34,019
Good to see you again.

73
00:06:36,034 --> 00:06:39,471
You, uh,
"wanded" me at security.

74
00:06:42,594 --> 00:06:46,751
Another one, please.
So how does one get into "wanding"?

75
00:06:48,795 --> 00:06:51,037
One stops being a cop.

76
00:06:51,223 --> 00:06:54,614
What a coincidence.
I just stopped being a doctor.

77
00:06:56,844 --> 00:06:58,175
Why'd you quit?

78
00:06:58,315 --> 00:06:59,120
I didn't.

79
00:06:59,401 --> 00:07:04,468
My son ratted me out for
drinking on the job. Thank you.

80
00:07:05,264 --> 00:07:07,074
Lost my license.

81
00:07:07,448 --> 00:07:11,653
Hmm. Yeah, I know.
It's hilarious.

82
00:07:12,730 --> 00:07:14,828
No, no. It's just that...

83
00:07:15,164 --> 00:07:18,643
I don't believe that parents and
their kids should work together.

84
00:07:18,875 --> 00:07:20,650
Too many issues.

85
00:07:20,872 --> 00:07:22,682
I'll drink to that.

86
00:07:26,761 --> 00:07:28,189
So where you headed?

87
00:07:28,375 --> 00:07:31,192
Sydney. Sydney, Australia.

88
00:07:32,955 --> 00:07:34,236
Want to come?

89
00:07:36,393 --> 00:07:38,202
I'm serious.

90
00:07:39,233 --> 00:07:41,666
Why would I go to
Sydney with you?

91
00:07:41,852 --> 00:07:44,352
Maybe fate has just thrown
the two of us together.

92
00:07:44,377 --> 00:07:47,624
You know,
like two drinks in an airport bar.

93
00:07:49,556 --> 00:07:51,930
Why would fate do that?

94
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:53,986
Oh, the same reason
fate does anything--

95
00:07:54,016 --> 00:07:57,166
so that we can help
each other out.

96
00:07:57,355 --> 00:07:59,792
You do need help, right?

97
00:08:01,706 --> 00:08:03,326
Unless you don't.

98
00:08:09,891 --> 00:08:12,439
What I'm doing down there
could be a little dangerous,

99
00:08:12,469 --> 00:08:15,183
and I need someone to protect me--
a bodyguard.

100
00:08:15,322 --> 00:08:19,672
It's perfect for someone
who stopped being a cop.

101
00:08:25,017 --> 00:08:27,163
I don't even know your name.

102
00:08:27,302 --> 00:08:31,075
Oh,  let's not use real names.
I tell you what--

103
00:08:31,216 --> 00:08:35,324
why don't you pick a name for me?
And then I'll pick one for you.

104
00:08:39,648 --> 00:08:41,257
You look like a Tom.

105
00:08:41,446 --> 00:08:45,648
Tom. What an excellent name.
And you should be a...

106
00:08:46,209 --> 00:08:47,252
Sarah.

107
00:08:53,255 --> 00:08:54,826
Australia.

108
00:09:14,807 --> 00:09:16,387
What  happened?

109
00:09:17,736 --> 00:09:19,790
I cut myself shaving.

110
00:09:25,301 --> 00:09:28,650
The guy in the hatch
tried to kill me.

111
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:34,201
You okay?

112
00:09:36,215 --> 00:09:38,007
I'm fine...

113
00:09:38,521 --> 00:09:40,379
but he won't be.

114
00:09:41,645 --> 00:09:43,837
- Hey, Ana?
- What?

115
00:09:45,758 --> 00:09:48,048
Don't do anything stupid.

116
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:23,734
If you've come to apologize,

117
00:10:23,819 --> 00:10:27,120
I forgive you for hitting
me with your crutch.

118
00:10:29,598 --> 00:10:32,845
I'm so glad my head
didn't break it.

119
00:10:33,782 --> 00:10:34,921
Why?

120
00:10:38,015 --> 00:10:40,719
Well, that's a broad question.

121
00:10:41,794 --> 00:10:44,705
Why did you try to hurt
Ana Lucia but not me?

122
00:10:47,143 --> 00:10:49,671
I'm not sure I know what
you're getting at, John.

123
00:10:49,813 --> 00:10:54,736
I was trapped under that
blast door... helpless.

124
00:10:54,829 --> 00:10:57,946
You could have crushed my skull,
but you didn't do a thing.

125
00:10:58,685 --> 00:11:00,395
Why didn't you?

126
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:03,678
Because you're one of
the good ones, John.

127
00:11:05,002 --> 00:11:08,105
What? What? Good what?

128
00:11:09,453 --> 00:11:11,885
None of this matters.
I'm dead, anyway.

129
00:11:13,573 --> 00:11:16,005
The doctor's gone
to make a trade,

130
00:11:16,102 --> 00:11:19,481
and we both know he'll come
back empty-handed, and then...

131
00:11:20,222 --> 00:11:22,844
I've lost my value.

132
00:11:23,695 --> 00:11:25,927
So either Jack comes
back here and kills me,

133
00:11:26,068 --> 00:11:29,667
or my people find out where
I'm being held, and they do it.

134
00:11:29,836 --> 00:11:32,413
Why would your own
people want to kill you?

135
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:36,521
Because the man in charge...

136
00:11:37,692 --> 00:11:42,098
He's a great man, John--
a brilliant man.

137
00:11:44,135 --> 00:11:47,013
But he is not a forgiving man.

138
00:11:48,592 --> 00:11:51,694
He'll kill me because
I failed, John.

139
00:11:52,413 --> 00:11:54,546
I failed my mission.

140
00:11:56,745 --> 00:11:58,268
What mission?

141
00:12:00,003 --> 00:12:03,632
When that woman caught
me in her trap,

142
00:12:04,288 --> 00:12:06,464
I was on my way here, John.

143
00:12:08,195 --> 00:12:10,368
I was coming for you.

144
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:14,742
Locke!

145
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:18,803
Locke, get out here!

146
00:12:19,693 --> 00:12:20,787
Locke!

147
00:12:22,712 --> 00:12:23,707
Locke!

148
00:12:24,701 --> 00:12:25,799
John!

149
00:12:48,809 --> 00:12:52,199
Hey, I've been knocking those
things down for 20 minutes.

150
00:12:52,339 --> 00:12:54,466
Get your hands
off my damn mango.

151
00:12:54,698 --> 00:12:56,988
Didn't figure you for
the fruit-picking type.

152
00:12:57,126 --> 00:12:58,941
What do you want?

153
00:12:59,499 --> 00:13:01,312
I need a gun.

154
00:13:02,356 --> 00:13:03,718
Well, here's an idea.

155
00:13:03,998 --> 00:13:06,912
Why not go to your buddy Jack?
He's got himself a gun.

156
00:13:07,143 --> 00:13:11,555
Oh, that's right. He's still
traipsin' around the jungle with Kate.

157
00:13:12,111 --> 00:13:15,637
If you've got a problem 'cause he's
making time with your girlfriend,

158
00:13:15,736 --> 00:13:18,355
don't take it out on me, man.

159
00:13:18,977 --> 00:13:21,299
How about you just
give me a gun?

160
00:13:22,530 --> 00:13:25,670
Here's another idea-- scram.

161
00:13:27,545 --> 00:13:29,718
You heard me. Now git.

162
00:14:01,448 --> 00:14:02,540
Sarah.

163
00:14:06,697 --> 00:14:08,463
Sarah, open the damn door.

164
00:14:11,225 --> 00:14:12,748
Good, you're up.

165
00:14:13,591 --> 00:14:15,833
It's, uh, it's time.

166
00:14:15,975 --> 00:14:17,597
Protection duty.

167
00:14:18,730 --> 00:14:20,341
Come on, let's go.

168
00:14:20,524 --> 00:14:23,145
After four days of drinking
and doing nothing,

169
00:14:23,284 --> 00:14:25,884
now, in the middle of the night,
you're ready to go?

170
00:14:25,903 --> 00:14:29,295
That's exactly right.
It's time. Come on.

171
00:14:29,855 --> 00:14:32,405
Fate's calling, Sarah.

172
00:14:45,436 --> 00:14:47,866
This is it.
Pull over right here.

173
00:14:51,573 --> 00:14:54,961
This is what you needed protection for--
the suburbs?

174
00:14:55,241 --> 00:14:57,103
Stay in the car.

175
00:14:57,245 --> 00:14:59,250
Should I keep the
meter running?

176
00:15:23,263 --> 00:15:24,634
Can I come in?

177
00:15:36,914 --> 00:15:40,498
Look, she's my daughter,
and I have every right to see her.

178
00:15:40,589 --> 00:15:42,832
No, you don't have a right!
Get out!

179
00:15:43,157 --> 00:15:46,932
I'm coming in here.
You can't stop me! She's my daughter!

180
00:15:47,072 --> 00:15:52,092
I pay the mortgage on this house!
I want to see my daughter!

181
00:15:52,232 --> 00:15:54,042
What the hell is
wrong with you?

182
00:15:54,236 --> 00:15:56,424
Don't you evercome back here!

183
00:15:56,751 --> 00:15:59,065
I was just having a
conversation with the lady.

184
00:15:59,095 --> 00:16:00,868
You need help!

185
00:16:19,043 --> 00:16:20,888
Dude, nice hole.

186
00:16:21,028 --> 00:16:22,321
What is it, Hurley?

187
00:16:23,388 --> 00:16:25,686
Hey, man,
you remember that radio we made?

188
00:16:26,238 --> 00:16:28,988
I was thinking maybe I could
get it to play some music.

189
00:16:29,389 --> 00:16:31,133
You know, for Libby.

190
00:16:31,930 --> 00:16:34,795
Well, it worked only once,and
then just for a minute.

191
00:16:35,269 --> 00:16:38,941
I've tried several times
since and only gotten static.

192
00:16:39,227 --> 00:16:42,350
Here's the thing.
Even that would be good.

193
00:16:42,511 --> 00:16:44,211
Because then,
Libby would be like,

194
00:16:44,506 --> 00:16:47,431
"it's the thought that counts,"
and I'll score major points,

195
00:16:47,461 --> 00:16:49,861
especially when she sees me
holding it over my head.

196
00:16:49,891 --> 00:16:53,861
And why would you hold a
static-generating radio over your head?

197
00:16:54,614 --> 00:16:56,764
They  didn't have "Say
Anything" in baghdad?

198
00:16:56,896 --> 00:16:59,614
It's awesome.
This dude, like, gets this boom box,

199
00:16:59,722 --> 00:17:02,042
and he holds it over his head
outside this chick's window,

200
00:17:02,072 --> 00:17:06,324
and he plays some Peter Gabriel song
for her, and bam! The girl's, like, his.

201
00:17:06,466 --> 00:17:08,384
I mean, after her dad goes to jail.
But then he gets her!

202
00:17:08,414 --> 00:17:10,286
I think I get the idea.

203
00:17:10,366 --> 00:17:12,334
You  should really
check it out sometime.

204
00:17:12,364 --> 00:17:15,613
I mean, if we ever, you know,
get off this island.

205
00:17:18,283 --> 00:17:20,457
If you want to do
something nice for Libby,

206
00:17:20,606 --> 00:17:24,133
there's a beautiful beach
3 kilometers from here.

207
00:17:24,272 --> 00:17:25,850
You could take her there.

208
00:17:27,438 --> 00:17:29,296
You think she'd like that?

209
00:17:33,188 --> 00:17:35,285
I took Shannon there once.

210
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:43,054
Michael. Michael.

211
00:17:46,522 --> 00:17:47,900
So it worked?

212
00:17:48,716 --> 00:17:51,129
What are you
talking about, John?

213
00:17:51,504 --> 00:17:54,248
Your deal. The trade.

214
00:17:54,832 --> 00:17:57,850
- If they gave us Michael--
- They didn't give us anything.

215
00:17:58,777 --> 00:18:01,930
So it was just a coincidence
that he came wandering out?

216
00:18:02,023 --> 00:18:04,289
I was shouting.
He heard my voice.

217
00:18:07,452 --> 00:18:09,553
What? They just let Michael go,

218
00:18:09,641 --> 00:18:12,070
hoping that we would keep
upour end of the bargain?

219
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:14,399
You think they're on
the honor system?

220
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:22,996
- Hey.
- Hey.

221
00:18:43,148 --> 00:18:45,704
Come out,come out,
whoever you are.

222
00:18:49,152 --> 00:18:50,701
I know you're there.

223
00:18:53,746 --> 00:18:56,227
Don't make me come
in after you.

224
00:18:58,973 --> 00:18:59,969
Ahem!

225
00:19:03,225 --> 00:19:07,099
Well, well, well.
What do we got here?

226
00:19:07,892 --> 00:19:12,577
Is little red riding hood gonna follow
the big bad wolf back to his stash
o' guns?

227
00:19:13,333 --> 00:19:15,589
Why don't you give me
that one right there?

228
00:19:15,707 --> 00:19:18,262
I ain't gonna
gimme-you nothin'.

229
00:19:20,069 --> 00:19:21,923
We been through this, Lucy.

230
00:19:36,228 --> 00:19:39,093
What you gonna do
now, muchacha?

231
00:20:17,363 --> 00:20:19,719
We need some damn
music in here.

232
00:20:21,216 --> 00:20:23,539
- Who is she?
- Who is who?

233
00:20:23,819 --> 00:20:25,010
That woman.

234
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:28,019
She is a very long
story, Sarah.

235
00:20:29,325 --> 00:20:30,905
It's Ana Lucia.

236
00:20:32,310 --> 00:20:34,544
Well, I'm still Tom.

237
00:20:35,339 --> 00:20:37,245
You're pathetic,
that's what you are.

238
00:20:37,450 --> 00:20:39,290
You bet your sweet ass I am.

239
00:20:45,344 --> 00:20:47,561
Why are you here?

240
00:20:49,812 --> 00:20:53,789
I'm here because I can't
apologize to my son.

241
00:20:54,974 --> 00:20:57,777
He tried to help me,
so I thanked him by cutting him off.

242
00:20:57,807 --> 00:20:59,954
I thanked him by hating him.

243
00:21:03,658 --> 00:21:09,635
You came here for the same reason I did,
kiddo. You ran away.

244
00:21:18,195 --> 00:21:23,168
My, my. Look what fate has
delivered up this time.

245
00:21:25,259 --> 00:21:26,313
Come on.

246
00:21:26,670 --> 00:21:30,061
Let's go have a drink or ten
and be pathetic together.

247
00:21:30,248 --> 00:21:31,199
What do you say?

248
00:21:39,262 --> 00:21:40,358
No.

249
00:21:46,356 --> 00:21:47,255
No.

250
00:21:49,928 --> 00:21:51,499
That's your call.

251
00:21:54,688 --> 00:21:57,073
Hey! I'm walking here.

252
00:22:01,435 --> 00:22:02,646
Wait.

253
00:22:03,541 --> 00:22:04,659
Don't.

254
00:22:07,351 --> 00:22:10,142
Let's just get the
hell out of Sydney.

255
00:22:10,368 --> 00:22:13,217
Let's just go. Let's go back.

256
00:22:15,496 --> 00:22:18,176
I can't ever go back.

257
00:22:21,552 --> 00:22:23,290
See you, kiddo.

258
00:22:42,237 --> 00:22:43,137
What?

259
00:22:45,248 --> 00:22:48,280
Don't you want my phone number?

260
00:22:50,975 --> 00:22:53,191
You tell anyone about this...

261
00:22:54,597 --> 00:22:56,194
and I'll kill you.

262
00:22:59,241 --> 00:23:01,972
Guess that takes
cuddling off the table.

263
00:23:16,925 --> 00:23:17,986
Hey  there.

264
00:23:18,248 --> 00:23:20,128
- Oh!
- How's it going?

265
00:23:21,373 --> 00:23:23,098
This isn't what it looks like.

266
00:23:23,273 --> 00:23:25,935
And...what does it look like?

267
00:23:27,222 --> 00:23:30,200
It... looks like something...

268
00:23:31,058 --> 00:23:34,164
that... it's not.

269
00:23:37,014 --> 00:23:38,531
Oh, man.

270
00:23:39,075 --> 00:23:40,399
I'm so busted.

271
00:23:40,735 --> 00:23:44,767
Hurley, I'm not here to tell
you how to act around food.

272
00:23:45,570 --> 00:23:47,573
No, I'm not busted for that.

273
00:23:47,728 --> 00:23:51,862
I'm busted for...
something else.

274
00:23:54,252 --> 00:23:57,847
I was packing a picnic,
'cause I was kinda hoping that

275
00:23:58,079 --> 00:24:00,252
you'd wanna go with me.

276
00:24:00,447 --> 00:24:03,316
You know, as an "us" thing.

277
00:24:03,853 --> 00:24:07,170
But it was a surprise.

278
00:24:09,655 --> 00:24:10,629
Really?

279
00:24:15,077 --> 00:24:16,723
That's very sweet.

280
00:24:21,230 --> 00:24:25,013
- So, do you wanna go?
- Where to?

281
00:24:26,016 --> 00:24:28,083
Can that part still
be a surprise?

282
00:24:44,362 --> 00:24:47,607
- Hey, you're back.
- Hey.

283
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:52,529
So, the others--
they didn't show up?

284
00:24:52,790 --> 00:24:53,404
No.

285
00:24:54,542 --> 00:24:56,432
Michael's back, though.

286
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:01,292
What happened here?

287
00:25:01,524 --> 00:25:02,329
My fault.

288
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:04,660
I left the tap on in
the bathroom sink,

289
00:25:04,701 --> 00:25:07,328
and Ana wiped out and hit
her head on the counter.

290
00:25:07,488 --> 00:25:09,110
And I'm sorry-- again.

291
00:25:10,869 --> 00:25:13,206
Yeah, don't worry about it.

292
00:25:13,372 --> 00:25:16,285
Jack. Jack.

293
00:25:17,510 --> 00:25:19,236
I think he's waking up.

294
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:23,524
Michael. Hey, Michael.

295
00:25:24,528 --> 00:25:25,764
Hey... Jack?

296
00:25:26,934 --> 00:25:28,192
Hey, man.

297
00:25:28,403 --> 00:25:29,740
Man... where...

298
00:25:30,331 --> 00:25:32,222
- How did I get...
- Oh, wait.

299
00:25:32,342 --> 00:25:34,942
Try to take it easy, okay?
You're back in the hatch.

300
00:25:34,961 --> 00:25:37,188
We found you out in
the jungle last night.

301
00:25:37,482 --> 00:25:39,389
Oh, my head.

302
00:25:41,712 --> 00:25:43,116
Welcome back.

303
00:25:45,182 --> 00:25:46,348
Hey, John.

304
00:25:52,047 --> 00:25:53,388
I found them.

305
00:25:58,934 --> 00:26:00,753
After I left,

306
00:26:01,988 --> 00:26:04,520
I hiked north,
back to where we were.

307
00:26:06,629 --> 00:26:09,688
Hiked to the beach,
followed the shoreline.

308
00:26:09,870 --> 00:26:13,484
A day later, I saw one.

309
00:26:14,436 --> 00:26:16,311
What did he look like?

310
00:26:16,434 --> 00:26:21,571
Dirty. Worn clothing,
no shoes. Simple--

311
00:26:21,689 --> 00:26:23,948
just like the rest of them.

312
00:26:24,539 --> 00:26:26,993
- Like the rest of them?
- Yeah.

313
00:26:27,329 --> 00:26:32,968
His people, the others.
I followed him back to his camp.

314
00:26:33,506 --> 00:26:38,960
They live in tents--canvas
tents and teepees.

315
00:26:39,123 --> 00:26:42,309
They eat dried fish.
They're worse off than we are.

316
00:26:42,816 --> 00:26:46,300
- How many of them were there?
- I counted 22.

317
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:48,731
- And, uh, the boat...
- I didn't see it.

318
00:26:48,971 --> 00:26:52,484
Did... did you see Walt?

319
00:26:54,465 --> 00:26:55,612
No.

320
00:26:57,504 --> 00:26:59,209
But I know he's there.

321
00:26:59,351 --> 00:27:01,116
What about everyone
else they took?

322
00:27:01,283 --> 00:27:04,274
Cindy? Did you see
any other kids?

323
00:27:04,694 --> 00:27:08,550
No, no, no kids.

324
00:27:08,692 --> 00:27:11,921
No, but I think they were in
the same place as my boy.

325
00:27:12,155 --> 00:27:13,966
They have a hatch.

326
00:27:15,156 --> 00:27:16,447
How do you know that they--

327
00:27:16,477 --> 00:27:20,200
There's set of metal doors leading
underground. What else could it be?

328
00:27:20,285 --> 00:27:22,538
And you think that that's
where they're keeping the kids?

329
00:27:22,568 --> 00:27:24,188
They keep it guarded 24/7.

330
00:27:24,342 --> 00:27:29,079
2 guards, 2 guns, and two guns is
all I saw. They're barely armed.

331
00:27:29,201 --> 00:27:31,681
Most of them are old,
and half of them are women.

332
00:27:35,198 --> 00:27:36,626
I wanted...

333
00:27:43,284 --> 00:27:44,867
I couldn't save him.

334
00:27:46,261 --> 00:27:48,504
So I came back to tell you...

335
00:27:50,359 --> 00:27:52,788
tell you that we can take them.

336
00:27:55,353 --> 00:28:00,076
As soon as I get my strength back,
I will take us back there.

337
00:28:00,476 --> 00:28:02,800
And  we are gonnaget
my boy back.

338
00:28:24,109 --> 00:28:25,809
You were right.

339
00:28:29,014 --> 00:28:30,920
Right about what?

340
00:28:31,162 --> 00:28:32,720
About Henry.

341
00:28:34,387 --> 00:28:37,261
What you and Sayid did to
him when you first found him.

342
00:28:37,512 --> 00:28:40,256
You were...you were right.

343
00:28:41,459 --> 00:28:43,140
I don't like how you did it,

344
00:28:43,456 --> 00:28:46,641
but I shouldn't have
gotten in your way.

345
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:53,793
Well, you did what you thought was
right at the time you thought it, Jack.

346
00:28:55,218 --> 00:28:59,326
I just hope the next time you decide
to do something, you include me.

347
00:29:00,397 --> 00:29:04,462
And something tells me...
that's gonna be soon.

348
00:29:06,806 --> 00:29:10,817
You heard Michael.
We can take them.

349
00:29:10,968 --> 00:29:13,691
Our friend with the beard told
us not to cross the line.

350
00:29:13,721 --> 00:29:15,798
These people are liars, John.

351
00:29:15,972 --> 00:29:18,522
Why the hell should we take
their word on anything?

352
00:29:19,892 --> 00:29:22,030
I couldn't agree more.

353
00:29:22,838 --> 00:29:23,820
So...

354
00:29:25,867 --> 00:29:27,281
now what?

355
00:29:30,658 --> 00:29:32,203
Where are you going?

356
00:29:32,495 --> 00:29:34,794
Get our guns back from Sawyer.

357
00:29:34,946 --> 00:29:37,084
We're gonna need youto
help convince him.

358
00:29:37,445 --> 00:29:39,095
Who's gonna take
care of Michael?

359
00:29:39,108 --> 00:29:41,767
I'll stay. You guys go ahead.

360
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:44,989
- You sure?
- Give sawyer my best.

361
00:29:45,532 --> 00:29:48,301
All right. We'll be back soon.

362
00:29:57,214 --> 00:29:59,848
Watch your head. Almost there.

363
00:30:00,031 --> 00:30:01,925
You ever watch
"the flintstones"?

364
00:30:02,117 --> 00:30:05,467
Sure. I used to watch it all the
time when I was in the hospital...

365
00:30:06,161 --> 00:30:09,269
when I... broke my hip.

366
00:30:09,545 --> 00:30:14,153
Did you ever notice how Fred would run
by the same thing over and over again?

367
00:30:14,275 --> 00:30:16,471
Third time past this tree.

368
00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:22,198
Uh, that's a different tree.

369
00:30:22,878 --> 00:30:25,432
Hurley, it's okay
if you're lost.

370
00:30:25,599 --> 00:30:28,244
Dude, I'm not lost.
Will you trust me?

371
00:30:28,431 --> 00:30:33,919
We're right about to walk onto the most
excellent secret beach on the island.

372
00:30:34,023 --> 00:30:36,185
And... surprise!

373
00:30:38,384 --> 00:30:41,493
Uh... Hurley?

374
00:30:41,648 --> 00:30:43,732
This is our beach.

375
00:30:44,077 --> 00:30:45,387
There's Jin.

376
00:30:52,387 --> 00:30:55,699
Hey, I tell you what.
Why not have the picnic here?

377
00:30:55,775 --> 00:30:57,811
Come on, give me the blankets.

378
00:30:58,373 --> 00:30:59,863
Blankets?

379
00:31:00,786 --> 00:31:03,029
You don't have any blankets?

380
00:31:04,339 --> 00:31:06,506
How about drinks?

381
00:31:09,345 --> 00:31:12,456
Okay, I tell you what.
I will handle the blankets.

382
00:31:12,705 --> 00:31:14,456
You just track down
Rose and Bernard.

383
00:31:14,486 --> 00:31:17,159
I saw them pull wine
from the pallet. Okay?

384
00:31:17,585 --> 00:31:20,061
Oh. Wine.

385
00:31:22,157 --> 00:31:23,336
Groovy.

386
00:31:24,571 --> 00:31:28,515
Hey, maybe if I get drunk enough,
I'll remember where I know you from.

387
00:31:30,250 --> 00:31:31,076
Yeah.

388
00:31:31,888 --> 00:31:32,635
Okay.

389
00:31:49,521 --> 00:31:50,468
Sawyer.

390
00:31:52,308 --> 00:31:53,714
Put the book down.

391
00:31:53,910 --> 00:31:55,788
It's not a book.
It's a manuscript.

392
00:31:55,908 --> 00:31:59,058
I'm about to be the first and
only guy to find out who done it.

393
00:32:00,048 --> 00:32:01,947
I think I got it figured out,

394
00:32:02,117 --> 00:32:04,821
so cool your damn jets and
walk around the coconut trees.

395
00:32:04,851 --> 00:32:06,675
I got, like,
ten pages left-- Hey!

396
00:32:08,443 --> 00:32:09,773
Wanna figure it out?

397
00:32:13,057 --> 00:32:13,826
Aah!

398
00:32:16,509 --> 00:32:18,339
What the hell is
your problem, doc?

399
00:32:18,617 --> 00:32:20,367
It's time to give
us the guns back.

400
00:32:21,221 --> 00:32:22,977
You burn the ending
of my book and now--

401
00:32:23,007 --> 00:32:25,731
- Where are they, James?
- You too, Brutus?

402
00:32:26,007 --> 00:32:28,957
Just take us there, Sawyer, all right?
Quit playing around.

403
00:32:29,012 --> 00:32:31,512
What, did you bring her
along for a sympathy vote?

404
00:32:31,664 --> 00:32:32,992
She ain't in my head, doc.

405
00:32:33,195 --> 00:32:35,867
So why don't you two just
go play in the jungle?

406
00:32:36,114 --> 00:32:38,653
Take us to the guns. Now.

407
00:32:44,822 --> 00:32:46,738
Oh, that bitch.

408
00:32:47,778 --> 00:32:51,135
She stole my damn gun.
Ana lucia.

409
00:32:52,506 --> 00:32:55,563
- Why would she need a gun?
- Son of a bitch.

410
00:32:58,440 --> 00:32:59,615
Jack...

411
00:33:03,644 --> 00:33:05,885
I need to tell you something.

412
00:33:15,501 --> 00:33:17,035
Pick it up.

413
00:33:22,935 --> 00:33:24,658
Cut yourself loose.

414
00:33:25,818 --> 00:33:26,778
What?

415
00:33:27,846 --> 00:33:29,277
Just do it.

416
00:33:31,989 --> 00:33:32,857
Why?

417
00:33:34,890 --> 00:33:36,029
You know why.

418
00:33:59,722 --> 00:34:02,641
He kept saying you
were misunderstood.

419
00:34:02,828 --> 00:34:06,422
- What are you talking about?
- Goodwin.

420
00:34:09,271 --> 00:34:12,491
Yes, he told us all
about you, Ana--

421
00:34:12,705 --> 00:34:16,857
How he thought you were worthy
and that he could change you.

422
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:23,932
But he was wrong...

423
00:34:32,476 --> 00:34:35,200
and it cost him his life.

424
00:34:36,904 --> 00:34:38,887
He was gonna kill me.

425
00:34:47,796 --> 00:34:49,450
Was he?

426
00:34:55,233 --> 00:34:57,255
Are you done?

427
00:34:59,258 --> 00:35:01,610
Yes, Ana, I'm done.

428
00:35:10,601 --> 00:35:12,560
So this is it, huh?

429
00:35:14,522 --> 00:35:18,516
Yes, Henry. This is it.

430
00:35:23,084 --> 00:35:24,814
I'm standing in front of you in

431
00:35:24,939 --> 00:35:27,432
the same suit that I'm
wearing o my father's funeral,

432
00:35:27,462 --> 00:35:29,080
and I'm asking you a favor.

433
00:35:29,265 --> 00:35:31,767
In 16 hours,
I need to land at L.A.X.,

434
00:35:32,146 --> 00:35:34,146
And I need that coffin
to clear customs,

435
00:35:34,242 --> 00:35:36,738
because there's going to
be a hearse waiting there.

436
00:35:36,768 --> 00:35:41,068
And I need that hearse to take me
and that coffin to a cemetery. Why?

437
00:35:41,162 --> 00:35:43,892
Chrissy, why can't I just
bring him to a funeral home

438
00:35:44,078 --> 00:35:47,045
and make all the arrangements?
Why can't I really take my time with it?

439
00:35:47,075 --> 00:35:51,152
Because... because I
need it to be done.

440
00:35:51,792 --> 00:35:53,777
I need it to be over.

441
00:35:56,539 --> 00:35:58,420
I just...

442
00:35:59,102 --> 00:36:01,420
I need to bury my father.

443
00:36:11,780 --> 00:36:13,682
That was an airplane.

444
00:36:14,412 --> 00:36:17,426
No, I'm not at work.
I'm in Sydney.

445
00:36:18,217 --> 00:36:20,669
That's right, Australia.

446
00:36:23,111 --> 00:36:24,850
I...

447
00:36:27,213 --> 00:36:29,407
I don't know, I...

448
00:36:35,297 --> 00:36:37,992
I made a mistake, mom.

449
00:36:40,970 --> 00:36:45,106
You knew, so I got as far
away from you as I could.

450
00:36:50,707 --> 00:36:52,831
But now...

451
00:36:54,822 --> 00:36:57,634
I want to come home, mom.

452
00:37:01,859 --> 00:37:03,863
So come home.

453
00:37:05,717 --> 00:37:12,981
- What flight are you on?
- I'm on Oceanic-- flight 815.

454
00:37:15,547 --> 00:37:18,503
I'll be there when
you land, mija.

455
00:37:39,181 --> 00:37:41,129
Where is everybody?

456
00:37:41,516 --> 00:37:43,916
What you said got
'em worked up.

457
00:37:44,034 --> 00:37:47,267
They went to get all the
guns back from Sawyer.

458
00:37:47,372 --> 00:37:49,071
Sawyer.

459
00:37:51,057 --> 00:37:53,712
Sawyer has all the guns.

460
00:37:55,165 --> 00:37:57,201
Long story.

461
00:38:00,090 --> 00:38:02,244
At least he didn't
get that one.

462
00:38:04,184 --> 00:38:05,418
Yeah.

463
00:38:06,752 --> 00:38:12,037
- Too bad I can't use it.
- Use it on what?

464
00:38:12,998 --> 00:38:17,152
We caught one of them--
the others.

465
00:38:17,830 --> 00:38:20,098
He's locked up in there.

466
00:38:22,339 --> 00:38:25,098
- How long has he...
- Over a week.

467
00:38:26,391 --> 00:38:28,816
And you're what,
taking care of him?

468
00:38:29,804 --> 00:38:32,041
He tried to kill me today.

469
00:38:35,765 --> 00:38:38,307
So I wanted him dead.

470
00:38:50,141 --> 00:38:51,780
I couldn't do it.

471
00:38:53,834 --> 00:38:55,778
I couldn't even kill him.

472
00:39:01,741 --> 00:39:04,211
I looked at him, and he...

473
00:39:11,057 --> 00:39:13,302
I can't do this anymore.

474
00:39:26,684 --> 00:39:28,523
Then let me do it.

475
00:39:34,083 --> 00:39:36,046
They're animals.

476
00:39:36,708 --> 00:39:41,091
I've seen these people,
and they are animals.

477
00:39:42,309 --> 00:39:46,378
They took my son right out of my hands.
They took my son and...

478
00:39:50,049 --> 00:39:53,631
I'll do it. Give me the gun.
I'll kill him.

479
00:39:57,645 --> 00:40:00,317
'Cause that's what they'd do.

480
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:08,619
What's the combination?

481
00:40:14,291 --> 00:40:15,767
18 right...

482
00:40:18,392 --> 00:40:19,994
1 left...

483
00:40:21,134 --> 00:40:22,610
31 right.

484
00:40:41,104 --> 00:40:42,993
I'm sorry.

485
00:40:44,209 --> 00:40:45,908
For what?

486
00:41:12,238 --> 00:41:13,273
Michael?
