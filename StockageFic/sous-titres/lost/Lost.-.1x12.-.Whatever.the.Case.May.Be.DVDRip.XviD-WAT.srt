1
00:01:08,268 --> 00:01:10,668
[twig snaps]

2
00:01:28,421 --> 00:01:30,446
[twigs snapping]

3
00:01:35,161 --> 00:01:38,824
- [thudding]
- [Sawyer] Ow! Son of a bitch!

4
00:01:39,466 --> 00:01:41,127
[sighs]

5
00:01:41,201 --> 00:01:43,396
- What are you doing?
- What are you doing?

6
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:46,530
- You practically busted my knee.
- Are you stalking me now?

7
00:01:46,606 --> 00:01:49,302
Stalking you?
l was protecting you.

8
00:01:49,375 --> 00:01:51,275
From what, Southern perverts?

9
00:01:51,344 --> 00:01:53,505
Yeah, whatever.

10
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:56,447
- l can't believe you.
- [laughing] lt's not that bad.

11
00:01:56,516 --> 00:01:59,417
lt's my knee.
l'll tell you how bad it is.

12
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:03,218
What the hell are you doing
all the way out here?

13
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:06,850
This is the only place
the trees aren't picked clean.

14
00:02:06,926 --> 00:02:09,121
You shouldn't be here alone,
not after...

15
00:02:09,195 --> 00:02:11,789
No, l'm fine.
l can take care of myself.

16
00:02:11,865 --> 00:02:14,561
Oh, of course.
''l don't need protecting.

17
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:16,602
l can take care of myself.

18
00:02:16,669 --> 00:02:19,467
- Me Kate. Me throw rock.''
- Shh.

19
00:02:20,773 --> 00:02:23,207
What, you smell blood
on the wind?

20
00:02:23,276 --> 00:02:25,506
You don't hear that?

21
00:02:28,047 --> 00:02:30,208
[water running]

22
00:02:43,429 --> 00:02:45,260
[Kate] What are you doing?

23
00:02:45,331 --> 00:02:48,664
[Sawyer] l need
to soak my sore knee.

24
00:02:50,103 --> 00:02:52,435
Come on, Freckles.

25
00:02:52,906 --> 00:02:55,636
After all we've been through
on this damn island,

26
00:02:55,708 --> 00:02:58,074
don't we deserve something good?

27
00:02:58,144 --> 00:03:00,112
What, you're gonna say no?

28
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:03,513
Are you some sort of navel-gazing,
no-fun, mopey type?

29
00:03:15,461 --> 00:03:17,156
Well.

30
00:03:18,464 --> 00:03:21,365
[Sawyer] lt's chilly. Come on, girl!

31
00:03:21,434 --> 00:03:23,163
Whoo-hoo!

32
00:03:24,571 --> 00:03:26,368
lt's nice, huh?

33
00:03:38,318 --> 00:03:40,980
[Sawyer] Come on,
let's go to the rock.

34
00:04:49,856 --> 00:04:52,086
[gasping]

35
00:04:52,158 --> 00:04:54,058
Hey, are you okay?

36
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:56,493
Yeah. You?

37
00:04:56,562 --> 00:04:58,223
Yeah. l'm gonna go check 'em out.

38
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:01,267
- Check 'em out for what?
- See what they got on 'em.

39
00:05:01,367 --> 00:05:02,766
Sawyer!

40
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,865
[gasping]

41
00:05:35,935 --> 00:05:38,597
Hey! Got myself a wallet.

42
00:05:38,671 --> 00:05:41,799
- You're disgusting.
- He ain't gonna miss it.

43
00:05:41,874 --> 00:05:43,933
Help me with that case.

44
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:46,877
Oh, l'm disgusting,
but you're not?

45
00:05:46,946 --> 00:05:48,641
lt's mine.

46
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:27,142
You wouldn't happen to have
your key on you, would you?

47
00:06:43,369 --> 00:06:45,303
That case ain't yours, is it?

48
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:52,878
No.

49
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:55,676
Well.

50
00:06:56,783 --> 00:06:58,978
You wouldn't mind if l just...

51
00:07:00,186 --> 00:07:03,212
- Take it.
- l don't care.

52
00:07:04,891 --> 00:07:07,052
That's not what it looks like.

53
00:07:14,901 --> 00:07:17,802
Something you want to tell me
about this suitcase?

54
00:07:24,811 --> 00:07:26,278
Take it.

55
00:07:39,992 --> 00:07:43,120
[people shouting]

56
00:07:51,704 --> 00:07:54,070
[Sayid] Everything
is washing out to sea!

57
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:55,937
This can't be normal.

58
00:07:56,008 --> 00:07:57,999
The tide shifting so suddenly.

59
00:07:58,077 --> 00:08:00,602
Rising in so short a time.

60
00:08:00,713 --> 00:08:02,840
There's a lot not normal around here.

61
00:08:02,882 --> 00:08:04,509
The rate this beach is eroding,

62
00:08:04,584 --> 00:08:07,280
the fuselage is going to
be underwater in days.

63
00:08:07,353 --> 00:08:11,016
We need to get all this stuff
off the beach before nightfall.

64
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:13,786
l hope moving up the coast
will make a difference.

65
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:17,387
lt'd make a difference
if everyone moved inland.

66
00:08:17,463 --> 00:08:20,762
l think you'll find people
slightly wary of entering the jungle

67
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:22,994
after what happened
to the pregnant girl,

68
00:08:23,069 --> 00:08:25,037
not to mention
whatever that thing is.

69
00:08:25,104 --> 00:08:26,867
Sayid...

70
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:31,705
l need you to take me back
to the French woman, Rousseau.

71
00:08:31,777 --> 00:08:33,335
Claire's still out there.

72
00:08:33,412 --> 00:08:36,108
Now, Rousseau mentioned
that there are...

73
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:38,514
- ...others on this island.
- Her mind is gone.

74
00:08:38,584 --> 00:08:40,279
- You heard them.
- l don't know.

75
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:42,082
- You said that you...
- The wind.

76
00:08:43,055 --> 00:08:45,182
lt was the wind playing tricks.

77
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,420
Then what about the papers
that you took from her then?

78
00:08:50,496 --> 00:08:52,225
Documents, maps. lsn't there...

79
00:08:52,298 --> 00:08:56,200
l'm skilled at mathematics, but these
are beyond anything l've ever seen.

80
00:08:56,269 --> 00:09:00,137
There are these notes in French
accompanying the maps and diagrams.

81
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:04,142
lf l could translate them, l might be
able to make sense of it, but...

82
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:06,678
What?

83
00:09:06,746 --> 00:09:09,806
Perhaps some things
are best left untranslated.

84
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:11,008
Yeah?

85
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:13,210
Maybe you should tell him that.

86
00:09:30,102 --> 00:09:32,332
You're doing something productive.

87
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:34,771
- Where have you been?
- What do you mean?

88
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:38,674
You and Locke have been leaving before
sunrise and coming back after dark.

89
00:09:38,744 --> 00:09:40,939
What are you doing out there?

90
00:09:41,948 --> 00:09:44,280
ls he your new boyfriend?

91
00:09:49,989 --> 00:09:52,981
- We're looking for Claire.
- l thought there was no trail,

92
00:09:53,059 --> 00:09:56,790
- that no one knew where to look.
- Yeah, at least l'm doing something.

93
00:09:56,862 --> 00:10:00,093
Don't you see the way they look at us?
We're a joke.

94
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:03,061
l'm trying to contribute something.

95
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:06,229
And you're just...
you're useless.

96
00:10:45,845 --> 00:10:48,746
[man] Okay, Miss Ryan,
if you'll just give me some lD,

97
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:51,282
we'll get started
on your loan app.

98
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:53,875
Okay. Here you go.

99
00:10:53,953 --> 00:10:57,218
So, what brings you
to New Mexico?

100
00:10:57,289 --> 00:10:59,780
- My work.
- What line of work is that?

101
00:10:59,859 --> 00:11:03,226
- l'm a photographer.
- What do you photograph?

102
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:05,786
l've been commissioned
for a coffee table book.

103
00:11:05,865 --> 00:11:08,834
Pictures of old theaters
in small towns.

104
00:11:08,901 --> 00:11:10,994
There's a fantastic one
down in Ruidoso.

105
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:13,265
You can't miss it.
lt's off the main road.

106
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:17,799
l'll have to make sure l give you
an acknowledgement, Mr... Hutton.

107
00:11:17,877 --> 00:11:19,401
- Mark.
- [door slams]

108
00:11:19,478 --> 00:11:22,174
[man] Everyone down
on the ground now!

109
00:11:22,248 --> 00:11:24,216
[shouting, screaming]

110
00:11:24,817 --> 00:11:26,944
[man] Don't even think about it!
Let's go!

111
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:29,010
Shut up and move over there!
Let's go!

112
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:33,150
- Who's back there? l see you!
- Big boy, get your ass down there!

113
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:35,326
Get out! Let's go!

114
00:11:35,394 --> 00:11:37,089
All right! Hold it right there!

115
00:11:38,064 --> 00:11:41,124
All right, girlie, get up
and get over there! Let's go! Move!

116
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,828
Stay there!
Get down on the ground, bitch!

117
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:46,569
Are you the manager?

118
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:48,937
- l said, are you the manager?
- Yes.

119
00:11:49,442 --> 00:11:52,275
Good. Now let's open
the money cage now

120
00:11:52,344 --> 00:11:54,244
before people start getting killed.

121
00:11:54,814 --> 00:11:56,941
[man 1] Don't look at me!
Look at the floor!

122
00:11:57,016 --> 00:11:58,210
[man 2] Down right now!

123
00:11:58,284 --> 00:12:00,445
l said, down!

124
00:12:33,018 --> 00:12:34,451
Gotcha.

125
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:35,953
Get off of me.

126
00:12:36,021 --> 00:12:37,852
l hate to bicker about positions,

127
00:12:37,923 --> 00:12:40,187
but l think
you're the one on top.

128
00:12:41,961 --> 00:12:44,293
Maybe you're not here
for the case at all.

129
00:12:44,363 --> 00:12:46,695
Ow! [groaning]

130
00:12:48,968 --> 00:12:49,957
Woman!

131
00:12:51,704 --> 00:12:55,140
lf you wanted to play rough,
all you had to do was say so.

132
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:01,242
You wanna try for it again?

133
00:13:03,349 --> 00:13:05,544
Give it to me.

134
00:13:06,552 --> 00:13:07,849
No.

135
00:13:47,426 --> 00:13:49,519
We're quite close to the equator.

136
00:13:49,595 --> 00:13:52,155
The sun might be stronger
than what you're used to.

137
00:13:52,231 --> 00:13:54,131
l have a pretty good base.

138
00:13:58,337 --> 00:14:00,635
There was a matter
l was going to ask you about.

139
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:09,042
- What?
- l need a favor.

140
00:14:12,651 --> 00:14:15,711
l need your help translating papers
l took from Rousseau.

141
00:14:15,788 --> 00:14:17,813
- Who's Rousseau?
- The Frenchwoman.

142
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:20,222
The distress call we intercepted.

143
00:14:26,899 --> 00:14:29,732
- Did my brother put you up to this?
- Your brother?

144
00:14:31,136 --> 00:14:32,603
No.

145
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:37,835
The papers contain equations
with notations in French.

146
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:41,539
- lf l can understand the notations...
- Sorry, l can't do it.

147
00:14:42,348 --> 00:14:44,680
You're the only person
who speaks French.

148
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:47,378
- l barely speak French.
- Please, Shannon.

149
00:14:47,453 --> 00:14:50,013
Can you at least try?

150
00:14:58,130 --> 00:14:59,688
Son of a bitch.

151
00:14:59,798 --> 00:15:01,732
You're wasting your time, man.

152
00:15:02,668 --> 00:15:06,160
lf you pick the lock on a Halliburton,
l'll put you on my back and fly.

153
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:08,798
You better find yourself
a runway, daddy,

154
00:15:08,874 --> 00:15:11,342
'cause there ain't
a lock l can't pick.

155
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:14,971
- What's he trying to do?
- Pick the lock on a Halliburton.

156
00:15:15,047 --> 00:15:17,038
[Hurley laughing]

157
00:15:17,116 --> 00:15:19,107
[laughing] Good luck.

158
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:25,713
The only way you're gonna open that case
is with pure force, impact velocity.

159
00:15:25,791 --> 00:15:28,726
- What's that mean?
- You gotta hit it with something hard

160
00:15:28,794 --> 00:15:32,958
like a sledgehammer.
Or the axe.

161
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:38,566
[straining]

162
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:46,570
- You got it.
- Yeah.

163
00:15:48,414 --> 00:15:49,813
Right there.

164
00:15:50,816 --> 00:15:52,943
lsn't there an easier way
to get there?

165
00:15:53,018 --> 00:15:55,612
The easiest way
isn't always the best.

166
00:15:55,688 --> 00:15:58,851
- Did anybody see you take it?
- No.

167
00:15:58,924 --> 00:16:01,552
- l don't think so.
- Well, which is it?

168
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:03,094
Sorry?

169
00:16:03,162 --> 00:16:05,323
''No,'' or ''l don't think so''?

170
00:16:08,167 --> 00:16:12,228
- No.
- Good. Let's get to work.

171
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:20,269
Hello, Charlie.

172
00:16:20,879 --> 00:16:23,143
Oh, that's right.

173
00:16:23,215 --> 00:16:25,775
You're not talking much
these days.

174
00:16:25,851 --> 00:16:28,376
But it doesn't mean
you get to be rude.

175
00:16:29,288 --> 00:16:31,449
Excuse me?

176
00:16:31,523 --> 00:16:33,013
Everybody else

177
00:16:33,092 --> 00:16:36,152
is helping us
move the camp up the beach,

178
00:16:36,228 --> 00:16:39,095
- except for you.
- Are you serious?

179
00:16:39,164 --> 00:16:42,133
You think you're the only one
with something to be sad about?

180
00:16:42,201 --> 00:16:45,295
l got sob stories for you,
so why don't you grab

181
00:16:45,371 --> 00:16:47,532
the other end of this thing
and help me?

182
00:16:52,277 --> 00:16:54,142
Well?

183
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:09,020
Come on.

184
00:17:09,628 --> 00:17:11,095
Come on.

185
00:17:18,203 --> 00:17:20,228
[screams]

186
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:30,305
lmpact velocity...

187
00:17:30,382 --> 00:17:32,213
Physics, my ass.

188
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:35,516
All right.

189
00:17:40,759 --> 00:17:43,057
Son of a...

190
00:17:43,128 --> 00:17:44,789
Unbelievable.

191
00:17:48,467 --> 00:17:50,560
Hey!

192
00:17:50,836 --> 00:17:52,701
Hey!

193
00:17:52,771 --> 00:17:54,295
Don't even think about it.

194
00:17:57,309 --> 00:18:00,608
Hey! Damn it.

195
00:18:30,476 --> 00:18:33,809
Hell, Freckles, l knew you wanted it.
l just didn't know how bad.

196
00:18:33,879 --> 00:18:35,471
Whoa!

197
00:18:35,547 --> 00:18:38,107
You're gonna have to come up
with a new move.

198
00:18:38,183 --> 00:18:39,673
Ah! God.

199
00:18:39,751 --> 00:18:41,878
Okay. Okay!

200
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:44,081
Okay, this is just silly.

201
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:47,425
Hold on.
l got a proposition for you.

202
00:18:47,493 --> 00:18:50,462
You tell me what's inside,
and l'll give it to you.

203
00:18:50,529 --> 00:18:51,996
Are you serious?

204
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,864
Hell, no way
to open the damn thing.

205
00:18:56,935 --> 00:19:00,132
At this point, all l care about
is satisfying my own curiosity.

206
00:19:01,573 --> 00:19:05,976
Oh! Easy, sweetheart.
l don't really care what it is.

207
00:19:07,045 --> 00:19:10,606
What's burning me up
is why it means so much to you.

208
00:19:15,053 --> 00:19:17,681
Last chance.

209
00:19:22,895 --> 00:19:24,226
All right.

210
00:19:29,801 --> 00:19:31,701
[man] Give me the key now.

211
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:34,261
l'm tired of asking nice.

212
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:36,807
Give me the money cage key now.

213
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:38,934
You're going to kill me.
Why would l...

214
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:41,479
You think we're having
a conversation here? Huh?

215
00:19:41,547 --> 00:19:43,811
Everybody be cool!
Do you wanna go home?

216
00:19:43,882 --> 00:19:47,113
Don't look at me! Look at the floor!
Everybody calm. Stay down.

217
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:49,313
Listen to me, l am not
gonna ask you again.

218
00:19:49,388 --> 00:19:50,821
l want that key!

219
00:19:50,889 --> 00:19:53,153
- l can take him.
- What?

220
00:19:53,225 --> 00:19:55,557
The tall guy,
he's not watching us.

221
00:19:55,627 --> 00:19:58,425
lt's now or never.
Keep your head down.

222
00:20:00,432 --> 00:20:02,059
Hey! Watch out!

223
00:20:05,103 --> 00:20:06,365
Pick it up!

224
00:20:07,606 --> 00:20:09,870
Pick it up!
Shoot him!

225
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:12,635
[man 2] What's wrong? Shoot!

226
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:14,406
- Cover him!
- [man 2] Shoot him!

227
00:20:14,479 --> 00:20:18,142
- Shoot him! Turn off the safety!
- Gimme that.

228
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:20,481
[man 2] lt's on the side!
Turn it off!

229
00:20:20,552 --> 00:20:23,043
l don't know how to use a gun!

230
00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:26,448
You wanna get shot, fat boy? Huh?

231
00:20:29,094 --> 00:20:31,028
- Okay, hero.
- No, please, don't.

232
00:20:31,096 --> 00:20:33,360
Shut up! Let's you and me go talk.

233
00:20:33,432 --> 00:20:36,731
Huh? Right in here. Let's go.

234
00:20:45,577 --> 00:20:48,341
[laughing]
''l don't know how to use a gun''?

235
00:20:48,413 --> 00:20:50,347
- That's classic.
- Yeah.

236
00:21:09,534 --> 00:21:11,593
[waves crashing]

237
00:21:16,241 --> 00:21:18,766
You never said anything
about math.

238
00:21:19,845 --> 00:21:22,746
You worry about the French.
l'll take care of the math.

239
00:21:25,584 --> 00:21:28,417
l can't do this.

240
00:21:28,487 --> 00:21:31,354
lf you really put your mind to it,
l know you can.

241
00:21:35,093 --> 00:21:36,958
Where did you learn
to speak French?

242
00:21:37,029 --> 00:21:39,156
l knew this guy.

243
00:21:42,834 --> 00:21:45,735
- This guy?
- ln France, in St. Tropez.

244
00:21:45,804 --> 00:21:47,931
l kind of lived there for a while.

245
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:53,138
Well, they say that is the best way
to learn a foreign language.

246
00:22:00,585 --> 00:22:02,075
All right.

247
00:22:02,888 --> 00:22:05,152
Let me see.

248
00:22:08,927 --> 00:22:10,519
So...

249
00:22:11,263 --> 00:22:13,128
Uh...

250
00:22:13,198 --> 00:22:16,224
[chuckling] What is this?
What is it for?

251
00:22:16,301 --> 00:22:19,134
[speaks Korean]

252
00:22:23,075 --> 00:22:26,602
- [moans]
- A headache.

253
00:22:26,678 --> 00:22:29,476
Oh. Cool.

254
00:22:29,548 --> 00:22:31,482
[Jack] All right.

255
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:32,539
Jack.

256
00:22:35,654 --> 00:22:39,112
- We got a problem.
- We have a problem, or...

257
00:22:40,092 --> 00:22:42,253
...you have a problem?

258
00:22:46,732 --> 00:22:50,463
Jack, you're the only one
who knows about me.

259
00:22:56,074 --> 00:22:58,133
Before l left for Sydney,

260
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:01,338
the marshal who was escorting me,
he had this silver case.

261
00:23:01,446 --> 00:23:04,040
The airline wouldn't let him
bring it on the plane.

262
00:23:04,082 --> 00:23:07,415
lt was hard enough trying
to convince them to let him wear a gun.

263
00:23:07,486 --> 00:23:10,717
But the case,
they made him check it.

264
00:23:10,789 --> 00:23:13,257
What was in the case?

265
00:23:13,325 --> 00:23:16,590
Some traveling money.
Some of his personal stuff.

266
00:23:18,397 --> 00:23:22,128
And four 9 millimeters
with a few boxes of ammo.

267
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:24,293
- Guns.
- Guns.

268
00:23:31,476 --> 00:23:35,276
- So, where is the case now?
- Sawyer has it.

269
00:23:35,814 --> 00:23:37,008
Uh-huh.

270
00:23:37,082 --> 00:23:39,482
- He hasn't been able to open it.
- Lucky for us.

271
00:23:39,551 --> 00:23:42,111
He will. Sooner or later.

272
00:23:44,389 --> 00:23:46,220
So, what do you need me to do?

273
00:23:49,428 --> 00:23:52,454
l know where the key is. He...

274
00:23:53,198 --> 00:23:55,598
The marshal kept it
in his wallet,

275
00:23:55,667 --> 00:23:57,635
in his back pocket.

276
00:23:57,869 --> 00:24:00,235
[sighs]

277
00:24:00,338 --> 00:24:03,307
- l buried him, Kate.
- l know.

278
00:24:04,242 --> 00:24:05,470
Where?

279
00:24:09,815 --> 00:24:11,373
[sighs]

280
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:14,715
- So, what else is in the case?
- What?

281
00:24:14,786 --> 00:24:16,549
What else is in the case?

282
00:24:16,621 --> 00:24:18,316
Nothing.

283
00:24:20,058 --> 00:24:23,994
- That's the truth?
- Just the guns.

284
00:24:28,233 --> 00:24:30,394
[sighs]

285
00:24:31,937 --> 00:24:34,030
lf you want my help,

286
00:24:35,173 --> 00:24:37,107
we're gonna open
the case together.

287
00:24:38,610 --> 00:24:40,840
Okay.

288
00:24:43,014 --> 00:24:44,948
Okay.

289
00:24:48,286 --> 00:24:51,312
- Why are you smiling?
- Am l?

290
00:24:51,389 --> 00:24:53,949
You look happy.

291
00:24:54,025 --> 00:24:55,686
Well, l guess l must be then.

292
00:24:56,928 --> 00:24:58,828
There's no reason.
Things are awful.

293
00:24:58,897 --> 00:25:01,695
- They're not awful.
- We're stranded on an island.

294
00:25:01,766 --> 00:25:04,633
- No one's coming for us.
- You don't know that.

295
00:25:04,703 --> 00:25:07,536
Well, what l do know

296
00:25:07,606 --> 00:25:10,507
is there's something in that jungle
that eats people.

297
00:25:10,575 --> 00:25:14,705
Just because we've not heard from it
doesn't mean it won't get hungry again.

298
00:25:14,779 --> 00:25:18,875
And l know there's a person or people
that are trying to hurt us.

299
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:20,508
- Charlie.
- And...

300
00:25:21,853 --> 00:25:23,616
Nobody blames you.

301
00:25:23,688 --> 00:25:25,121
What?

302
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:26,817
For what happened to Claire.

303
00:25:26,892 --> 00:25:29,326
lt's not your fault.

304
00:25:29,394 --> 00:25:32,124
You did everything
that you could do,

305
00:25:32,197 --> 00:25:35,496
and you came very close
to dying yourself.

306
00:25:36,434 --> 00:25:38,163
Yeah.

307
00:25:39,771 --> 00:25:43,537
[sighs] Maybe l should have died.

308
00:25:43,608 --> 00:25:46,202
You know what l think, Charlie?

309
00:25:49,781 --> 00:25:51,578
You need to ask for help.

310
00:25:52,784 --> 00:25:54,843
Who's gonna help me?

311
00:25:59,124 --> 00:26:01,752
[Kate] So why didn't you
put him with the others?

312
00:26:01,826 --> 00:26:03,521
When you burned the fuselage?

313
00:26:07,065 --> 00:26:09,465
Because l needed to bury him.

314
00:26:22,814 --> 00:26:25,442
- [Kate] So you ready to do this?
- Hell, yeah.

315
00:26:25,517 --> 00:26:27,678
By now their imaginations
are running wild.

316
00:26:27,752 --> 00:26:30,721
Don't hold back. He won't talk
if the details are off.

317
00:26:30,789 --> 00:26:33,553
- You and your details, Maggie.
- [grunts]

318
00:26:37,262 --> 00:26:39,287
- Okay, hero.
- No, please, don't.

319
00:26:39,364 --> 00:26:42,299
Shut up!
Everybody just relax!

320
00:26:42,367 --> 00:26:44,096
[sobbing]

321
00:26:44,169 --> 00:26:46,865
- [man 2] l said quiet.
- [man 1] Okay, Mr. Manager,

322
00:26:46,938 --> 00:26:48,428
you want to be a hard-ass?

323
00:26:48,506 --> 00:26:51,100
Protect a vault that doesn't
even belong to you?

324
00:26:51,176 --> 00:26:54,373
Okay.
There's gonna be consequences.

325
00:26:54,446 --> 00:26:58,246
- He's gonna kill me anyway.
- l swear, if you don't shut up.

326
00:27:00,385 --> 00:27:03,183
You got three seconds
to give me that damn key.

327
00:27:03,254 --> 00:27:05,188
One...

328
00:27:05,256 --> 00:27:07,884
Two...

329
00:27:07,959 --> 00:27:09,290
- Three.
- All right.

330
00:27:10,462 --> 00:27:12,760
l'll give it to you.

331
00:27:12,831 --> 00:27:15,299
Good. Let's go.

332
00:27:15,367 --> 00:27:17,232
Right around here.

333
00:27:17,302 --> 00:27:18,769
Let's go.

334
00:27:22,941 --> 00:27:25,205
[groaning]

335
00:27:30,982 --> 00:27:33,246
[retching]

336
00:27:33,318 --> 00:27:35,878
[coughing]

337
00:27:42,961 --> 00:27:45,122
- You all right?
- Compared to what?

338
00:27:46,164 --> 00:27:49,190
- You want me to...
- No. l'll do it.

339
00:27:49,267 --> 00:27:50,962
Oh, God.

340
00:27:59,444 --> 00:28:01,878
[flies buzzing]

341
00:28:03,715 --> 00:28:05,580
- Did you get it?
- Yeah. [coughing]

342
00:28:07,252 --> 00:28:08,879
Oh!

343
00:28:13,525 --> 00:28:15,516
[gasps] Oh!

344
00:28:15,593 --> 00:28:17,356
Oh.

345
00:28:27,872 --> 00:28:30,568
The key isn't in here.

346
00:28:30,642 --> 00:28:32,769
lt isn't?

347
00:28:35,146 --> 00:28:38,980
That was real good sleight of hand
distracting me with the wallet.

348
00:28:44,322 --> 00:28:45,687
Open it.

349
00:28:57,035 --> 00:28:59,435
- Jack...
- Don't.

350
00:29:00,905 --> 00:29:02,600
Don't.

351
00:29:13,017 --> 00:29:16,077
[speaking French]

352
00:29:16,154 --> 00:29:17,143
Um...

353
00:29:19,924 --> 00:29:22,392
''The sea of sparkles?''
No, wait. Um...

354
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:26,055
''The sea of silver sparkles
that change.''

355
00:29:27,532 --> 00:29:30,365
- lt's the same as the last one.
- Are you sure?

356
00:29:32,570 --> 00:29:35,437
The equation is different.
lt doesn't relate.

357
00:29:35,507 --> 00:29:37,998
What you're saying
doesn't make any sense.

358
00:29:39,177 --> 00:29:40,405
Okay.

359
00:29:40,478 --> 00:29:42,503
What about this one?

360
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:44,741
lt should say something
about latitude.

361
00:29:44,816 --> 00:29:47,580
- Something about the stars.
- Give me some room.

362
00:29:49,621 --> 00:29:51,248
Um...

363
00:29:51,322 --> 00:29:53,813
''Next to the pond... blue...''

364
00:29:53,892 --> 00:29:57,453
Uh... ''Blue eternity.''

365
00:29:58,296 --> 00:30:00,560
No, wait, no. Um, ''Blue infinity.''

366
00:30:00,632 --> 00:30:02,862
- ''Blue infinity''?
- ''Blue infinity.''

367
00:30:04,502 --> 00:30:07,062
There's something about this
that is so familiar.

368
00:30:07,138 --> 00:30:10,130
You've been telling me what sounds
very much like nonsense

369
00:30:10,208 --> 00:30:12,802
for the past hour,
and now it seems familiar?

370
00:30:12,911 --> 00:30:16,847
Okay, A<i>:</i> l told you
that my French sucks.

371
00:30:16,915 --> 00:30:20,009
And B<i>:</i> This isn't
my nonsense, okay?

372
00:30:20,084 --> 00:30:24,180
Do you ever think that after 1 6 years
on Mystery Frickin' lsland,

373
00:30:24,255 --> 00:30:27,019
your friend might not be
quite adjusted?

374
00:30:29,994 --> 00:30:32,019
This was a mistake.

375
00:30:33,665 --> 00:30:35,360
Yeah.

376
00:30:35,433 --> 00:30:38,459
Haven't you heard?
l'm completely useless.

377
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:50,975
Sawyer?

378
00:30:52,283 --> 00:30:54,114
Doctor.

379
00:30:56,187 --> 00:30:59,156
So, what can l do you for?

380
00:31:01,292 --> 00:31:05,228
Figured she'd get you
to do her dirty work for her.

381
00:31:05,296 --> 00:31:07,787
So, what?
We gonna wrestle for it?

382
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:09,731
No, you're gonna give it to me.

383
00:31:09,801 --> 00:31:11,701
- Am l?
- Yeah.

384
00:31:11,769 --> 00:31:14,329
l'm just gonna give it to you?

385
00:31:14,405 --> 00:31:15,895
Yeah.

386
00:31:15,974 --> 00:31:18,841
- Why would l want to do that?
- Cephalexin.

387
00:31:20,311 --> 00:31:21,642
Yeah? Go on.

388
00:31:21,713 --> 00:31:26,150
That's the antibiotic l'm giving you
for the knife wound in your arm.

389
00:31:26,217 --> 00:31:30,153
You're in the middle of a cycle.
lf l keep giving you the pills,

390
00:31:30,221 --> 00:31:32,712
you're gonna be
as right as rain.

391
00:31:32,790 --> 00:31:35,554
But l'm gonna stop
giving you the pills.

392
00:31:35,627 --> 00:31:38,687
For two days you're gonna
think you're all good.

393
00:31:38,763 --> 00:31:40,788
Then it's gonna start to itch.

394
00:31:41,633 --> 00:31:44,727
The day after, the fever will come
and you'll see red lines

395
00:31:44,802 --> 00:31:48,329
running up and down your arm.
Day or two after that...

396
00:31:48,973 --> 00:31:53,569
...you'll beg me to take the case
just to cut off your arm.

397
00:31:55,046 --> 00:31:57,139
That's a nice story, Jack.

398
00:31:57,215 --> 00:31:59,547
And even if it were true,

399
00:32:00,184 --> 00:32:01,879
l don't think you could do it.

400
00:32:04,155 --> 00:32:06,089
You're wrong.

401
00:32:11,362 --> 00:32:13,762
She tell you what's inside?

402
00:32:16,701 --> 00:32:18,760
Yeah, me neither.

403
00:32:20,004 --> 00:32:23,804
Hope you got yourself some jaws of life
back in Cave Town.

404
00:32:23,875 --> 00:32:26,241
That's what it's gonna take
to pop this bitch.

405
00:32:26,311 --> 00:32:28,677
l'll figure something out.

406
00:32:31,849 --> 00:32:34,613
l know you think
you're doing her a favor,

407
00:32:34,686 --> 00:32:37,849
but however she talked you
into doing this,

408
00:32:37,922 --> 00:32:39,583
she lied, brother.

409
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:02,668
Jack?

410
00:33:02,747 --> 00:33:04,339
We're gonna do this together.

411
00:33:06,451 --> 00:33:08,851
- Why?
- Because that's what l said we'd do.

412
00:33:15,893 --> 00:33:19,021
[man] What are you waiting for?
Open the damn thing!

413
00:33:20,198 --> 00:33:22,928
Hell, now we're talking.
Don't move.

414
00:33:24,469 --> 00:33:26,994
- Please don't. l...
- Shut up.

415
00:33:34,512 --> 00:33:37,675
l let you in.
Now please let the girl go.

416
00:33:40,985 --> 00:33:42,680
Let the girl go?

417
00:33:44,188 --> 00:33:47,316
Man, you have no idea, do you?

418
00:33:47,392 --> 00:33:50,190
The girl is the one
who set you up.

419
00:33:50,261 --> 00:33:54,220
The girl picked this bank.
Picked this vault.

420
00:33:54,298 --> 00:33:56,459
This whole thing
is the girl's idea.

421
00:34:00,238 --> 00:34:03,730
- What are you doing?
- Easy, Maggie.

422
00:34:03,808 --> 00:34:05,469
Just cleaning up after myself.

423
00:34:06,911 --> 00:34:08,173
Hey!

424
00:34:11,382 --> 00:34:13,646
You shoot, l shoot.

425
00:34:14,819 --> 00:34:17,481
- Wait. What?
- l said no one gets hurt.

426
00:34:18,790 --> 00:34:20,815
l know you're cold, baby.

427
00:34:20,892 --> 00:34:23,520
But you're not that cold.

428
00:34:24,629 --> 00:34:26,529
[screams]

429
00:34:27,732 --> 00:34:30,394
What the hell is going on here?

430
00:34:30,468 --> 00:34:33,528
- You shot me, you stupid bitch!
- Shut up, Jason.

431
00:34:33,604 --> 00:34:35,435
l told you not to trust her!

432
00:34:35,506 --> 00:34:38,407
l need the key
to safety deposit box 850 now.

433
00:34:38,476 --> 00:34:41,377
- Who are you?
- The key to the box now.

434
00:34:41,446 --> 00:34:43,846
You need two keys,
the bank's and...

435
00:34:43,915 --> 00:34:45,940
lf you had the customer key, why...

436
00:34:46,017 --> 00:34:47,609
l'm not on the signatory card.

437
00:34:47,685 --> 00:34:50,279
You put me up to this
to get into a safe deposit box?

438
00:34:50,354 --> 00:34:53,084
l swear to God,
you better kill me,

439
00:34:53,157 --> 00:34:56,786
- 'cause if you don't...
- My name's not Maggie. Now go.

440
00:35:10,942 --> 00:35:12,671
Anything you want to tell me?

441
00:35:17,215 --> 00:35:18,978
All right then.

442
00:35:56,187 --> 00:35:57,984
ls this it?

443
00:35:58,055 --> 00:36:00,353
ls this what you wanted?

444
00:36:28,419 --> 00:36:30,410
What is it?

445
00:36:32,990 --> 00:36:35,550
- lt's nothing.
- What is it, Kate?

446
00:36:35,626 --> 00:36:37,890
You wouldn't understand.

447
00:36:37,962 --> 00:36:39,793
l want the truth.

448
00:36:39,864 --> 00:36:43,163
Just this once. What is it?

449
00:36:44,535 --> 00:36:47,060
- lt belonged to the man l loved.
- The truth.

450
00:36:47,138 --> 00:36:48,969
lt belonged
to the man l loved!

451
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,530
Stop lying to me!
The truth!

452
00:36:50,608 --> 00:36:53,577
lt belonged to the man l killed!

453
00:36:57,548 --> 00:36:59,379
[Kate sobbing]

454
00:38:36,347 --> 00:38:39,077
Your husband was in
the tail section of the plane.

455
00:38:40,151 --> 00:38:42,176
Yes, he was.

456
00:38:43,287 --> 00:38:45,255
But he'll be back.

457
00:38:46,957 --> 00:38:49,289
You think he's still alive?

458
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:51,419
l know he is.

459
00:38:53,431 --> 00:38:55,661
How?

460
00:38:55,733 --> 00:38:57,291
l just do.

461
00:38:59,904 --> 00:39:03,897
lt's a fine line
between denial and faith.

462
00:39:03,974 --> 00:39:07,000
lt's much better on my side.

463
00:39:25,229 --> 00:39:26,696
[sobbing] Help me.

464
00:39:26,764 --> 00:39:28,561
Baby...

465
00:39:30,935 --> 00:39:33,335
l'm not the one
that can help you.

466
00:39:45,916 --> 00:39:48,544
Heavenly father,

467
00:39:49,387 --> 00:39:51,218
we thank you.

468
00:39:52,523 --> 00:39:57,256
We thank you for bringing us
together tonight.

469
00:39:58,229 --> 00:40:01,130
And we ask,

470
00:40:01,198 --> 00:40:04,998
that you show Charlie the path...

471
00:40:06,237 --> 00:40:08,762
[people chattering]

472
00:40:32,596 --> 00:40:34,928
The guy from St. Tropez,

473
00:40:36,066 --> 00:40:38,933
he had this kid.

474
00:40:39,003 --> 00:40:42,097
A real snot, who hated me.

475
00:40:42,173 --> 00:40:43,606
His name was Laurent.

476
00:40:43,674 --> 00:40:47,974
He watched this movie
over and over and over again

477
00:40:48,045 --> 00:40:51,173
every day, all day,
like kids do, 900 times.

478
00:40:51,248 --> 00:40:53,773
lt was the cartoon about fish.

479
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:56,984
You know,
one of the computer ones.

480
00:40:57,054 --> 00:40:58,988
Why are you telling me this?

481
00:40:59,089 --> 00:41:01,080
The movie was dubbed in French,

482
00:41:01,125 --> 00:41:03,457
and at the end,
there was this song.

483
00:41:04,628 --> 00:41:08,894
Those notations,
they're song lyrics.

484
00:41:08,966 --> 00:41:10,957
And your French woman,

485
00:41:11,035 --> 00:41:12,798
she's just like Laurent,

486
00:41:12,870 --> 00:41:15,430
'cause she wrote them
over and over again.

487
00:41:16,607 --> 00:41:18,507
What's the song?

488
00:41:21,812 --> 00:41:25,304
[singing in French]

489
00:41:53,844 --> 00:41:56,711
[continues singing in French]
