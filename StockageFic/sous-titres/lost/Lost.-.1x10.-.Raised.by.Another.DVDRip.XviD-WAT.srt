00:00:06,406 --> 00:00:09,842
French! The French are coming! l've
never been so happy to hear the French!

4
00:00:09,909 --> 00:00:12,377
- Does anyone speak French?
- She does.

[Shannon] ''l'm alone now.

00:00:17,684 --> 00:00:19,447
On the island alone.

00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:22,511
Please, someone come.

9
00:00:22,589 --> 00:00:25,956
The others, they're...
They're dead.

10
00:00:26,026 --> 00:00:27,425
lt killed them.

00:00:29,329 --> 00:00:32,321

13
00:00:34,434 --> 00:00:37,335
- l can't stay here.
- There's nowhere to go.

14
00:00:37,404 --> 00:00:39,668
Someone has to walk the shore
and map the island.

15
00:00:39,739 --> 00:00:41,969
See what else there is.

16
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:43,600

- You know what's happening.

23
00:02:38,858 --> 00:02:42,954
- But l don't understand. Why...?
- lt was your responsibility,

24
00:02:43,029 --> 00:02:45,520
but you gave him away, Claire.

25
00:02:47,267 --> 00:02:51,294

Wait, wait, wait a minute!

lt's okay! lt's okay.

00:03:54,767 --> 00:03:57,531
- lt's all right. You were dreaming.
- [sobbing]

32
00:04:00,406 --> 00:04:03,204
You were sleepwalking.
All right?

33
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:06,275
Okay.

34
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,478
Claire, what happened?

35
00:04:33,139 --> 00:04:34,902
Must have been
a hell of a nightmare.

36
00:04:36,876 --> 00:04:39,140
Who said it was a nightmare?

37
00:04:39,912 --> 00:04:41,709
When someone makes a fist so tight

38
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:44,579
they dig their nails a quarter
of an inch into their palms,

39
00:04:44,651 --> 00:04:47,313
they probably weren't
dreaming about riding ponies.

40
00:04:48,221 --> 00:04:52,624
- Did you ever sleepwalk before?
- No. l don't think so.

41
00:04:52,692 --> 00:04:56,025
- How would l know?
- lt'd get back to you.

42
00:04:56,095 --> 00:04:59,428
l had a girlfriend once that, uh,
told me l talked in my sleep.

43
00:04:59,499 --> 00:05:02,491
- What did you say?
- Don't know.

44
00:05:02,568 --> 00:05:05,537
Whatever it was, she didn't like it.

45
00:05:08,408 --> 00:05:12,811
- How was your OB<i>l</i>G YN in Sydney?
- Good. She was good.

46
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:15,848
She was okay with letting you fly
in your third trimester?

47
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:20,616
Yeah, l went for a checkup a week
before, and she said it would be fine.

48
00:05:21,521 --> 00:05:25,514
- Ultrasound was cool?
- Mm-hmm. Very healthy.

49
00:05:27,794 --> 00:05:32,424
- How you been feeling?
- Okay. Back's pretty sore,

50
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:35,365
but probably just from
sleeping on the ground.

51
00:05:35,435 --> 00:05:38,871
l get dizzy if l stand up too fast.

52
00:05:38,938 --> 00:05:41,930
- And l have to pee all the time.
- [laughing]

53
00:05:42,642 --> 00:05:46,271
- You eating enough?
- Boar and bananas.

54
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:47,779
How many weeks in are you?

55
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:51,510
What was the date that you found out
that you were pregnant?

56
00:05:54,053 --> 00:05:55,680
- [man] ls it pink?
- l don't know.

57
00:05:55,755 --> 00:05:57,382
l mean, did you actually pee on it?

58
00:05:57,457 --> 00:06:00,017
- Just give me a second.
- Maybe you didn't do it right.

59
00:06:00,093 --> 00:06:02,357
- Thomas, l can pee on a stick.
- What color is it?

60
00:06:02,428 --> 00:06:03,690
How long's it been?

61
00:06:03,763 --> 00:06:07,699
- Six... 66 seconds. Oh, gosh.
- Shh.

62
00:06:08,835 --> 00:06:11,531
- Okay, there's definitely two lines.
- Two pink lines?

63
00:06:11,604 --> 00:06:14,072
Pink? No, no, no.
These are, like, red.

64
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:15,903
What?

65
00:06:15,975 --> 00:06:17,067
They're pink.

66
00:06:17,143 --> 00:06:20,874
These two lines... First of all,
these tests are not always accurate.

67
00:06:20,947 --> 00:06:24,212
No, no, no. My uncle, you know,
we thought he had testicular cancer.

68
00:06:24,283 --> 00:06:26,911
- You remember that?
- He did. He's dead.

69
00:06:26,986 --> 00:06:29,716
Well, yeah... l mean, no, no.
lt was like a wrong...

70
00:06:29,789 --> 00:06:33,520
lt was a bad diagnosis. This thing
doesn't mean for sure you're pregnant.

71
00:06:33,593 --> 00:06:34,890
- Thomas!
- Get another.

72
00:06:34,961 --> 00:06:39,591
l am six weeks late, okay?
Six weeks. That never happens.

73
00:06:39,665 --> 00:06:42,759
l'm pregnant.

74
00:06:42,835 --> 00:06:44,700
[sobbing]

75
00:06:44,771 --> 00:06:49,504
Okay. Okay, look,
it's all gonna be okay.

76
00:06:49,575 --> 00:06:51,770
l know. l know.

77
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:57,144
Hey, Claire...

78
00:06:59,051 --> 00:07:02,179
You know, if we wanted to,
we could do this.

79
00:07:03,156 --> 00:07:05,556
- [scoffs] Stop it.
- No, l'm not kidding.

80
00:07:05,625 --> 00:07:09,083
- My mom would disown me.
- She basically has already.

81
00:07:10,997 --> 00:07:15,457
Yeah, and but with what? l mean,
my $5-an-hour job at Fish 'n Fry?

82
00:07:15,535 --> 00:07:20,700
You're not the only one with a job, you
know? l mean, l've got my painting.

83
00:07:21,574 --> 00:07:25,101
That's sweet, but...

84
00:07:25,178 --> 00:07:28,944
- This isn't what we want.
- Maybe it is.

85
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:33,646
You know?

86
00:07:33,719 --> 00:07:35,914
This could be like, uh...

87
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:41,590
l don't know.
lt could be, like, the best thing ever.

88
00:07:45,498 --> 00:07:48,399
You'd really want to try?

89
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:51,198
Yeah.

90
00:07:58,044 --> 00:08:02,208
Claire, l love you.

91
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:21,933
Well, this is a first.

92
00:08:22,435 --> 00:08:28,135
You standing still,
middle of the day, doing nothing.

93
00:08:28,207 --> 00:08:31,574
- Amazing.
- l'm doing something.

94
00:08:31,644 --> 00:08:34,374
[laughing] Yeah? What's that?

95
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:37,778
l'm sinking.

96
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:42,583
Water goes out,
takes the sand with it and you sink.

97
00:08:46,726 --> 00:08:48,990
l used to do it with my mom
when l was a kid.

98
00:08:55,234 --> 00:09:00,035
Ah. New plan. You're gonna just sink
your way right off the island.

99
00:09:00,106 --> 00:09:01,835
Sayid would be proud.

100
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:07,342
He's been gone for almost a week.

101
00:09:07,413 --> 00:09:09,574
Something tells me he'll be okay.

102
00:09:12,518 --> 00:09:15,351
So, what are you doing
this far from the caves?

103
00:09:15,421 --> 00:09:19,187
Bringing water down.
Bringing fish back.

104
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:26,559
Claire's gonna have the baby soon.

105
00:09:39,745 --> 00:09:41,440
Dear diary,

106
00:09:41,514 --> 00:09:44,347
still on the bloody island.

107
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:47,045
Today, l swallowed a bug.

108
00:09:48,988 --> 00:09:51,218
Love, Claire. [chuckles]

109
00:09:52,725 --> 00:09:55,694
[sighs] Here.

110
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:59,656
What separates us from these
savage Yanks if we can't drink tea?

111
00:10:02,001 --> 00:10:05,266
- Feeling better?
- lt was just a dream.

112
00:10:05,338 --> 00:10:07,704
Mmm.

113
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:11,634
l have this dream.

114
00:10:11,711 --> 00:10:13,736
l'm driving a bus,

115
00:10:13,813 --> 00:10:17,146
and my teeth start falling out.

116
00:10:17,216 --> 00:10:21,277
My mum is in the back,
eating biscuits.

117
00:10:21,354 --> 00:10:24,482
Everything smells of bacon.

118
00:10:24,557 --> 00:10:26,821
lt's weird.

119
00:10:26,892 --> 00:10:29,452
Of course, l don't
wake up screaming.

120
00:10:29,528 --> 00:10:31,587
l'm all right, Charlie.

121
00:10:31,664 --> 00:10:34,030
Mmm. No, of course you are.

122
00:10:36,569 --> 00:10:38,469
lt's just...

123
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:40,962
...l think about you...

124
00:10:42,008 --> 00:10:44,101
...in this place.

125
00:10:44,176 --> 00:10:46,838
How hard it must be for you,

126
00:10:46,912 --> 00:10:49,847
without your family
and your friends.

127
00:10:49,915 --> 00:10:53,407
And l think, we could be friends.

128
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:55,977
l could be your friend.

129
00:10:58,157 --> 00:11:00,557
We don't have to do
each other's hair or anything.

130
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:03,629
l just mean that, you know,

131
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:08,930
if you needed someone
to talk to about anything,

132
00:11:10,269 --> 00:11:12,237
l'm here.

133
00:11:16,542 --> 00:11:18,533
Charlie...

134
00:11:26,452 --> 00:11:27,851
Okay.

135
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:33,515
- l didn't mean that l...
- lt's cool, Claire. lt's cool.

136
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:42,728
Thomas cleaned out his whole loft.

137
00:11:42,802 --> 00:11:45,999
- l'm officially moving in on Tuesday.
- That is great!

138
00:11:46,072 --> 00:11:48,632
l know. He's awesome.

139
00:11:50,509 --> 00:11:52,807
- You know, maybe we shouldn't...
- No.

140
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:55,244
- You're not backing out now.
- lt seems silly.

141
00:11:55,314 --> 00:11:56,906
He's just a psychic, Claire.

142
00:11:56,982 --> 00:11:59,678
l thought you were into this,
all your astrology stuff.

143
00:11:59,752 --> 00:12:03,085
Yeah, l know, but l don't
need somebody telling me

144
00:12:03,155 --> 00:12:05,453
what's gonna happen
or how to live my life.

145
00:12:05,524 --> 00:12:08,015
lt's not about what you need.
lt's about what's fun.

146
00:12:08,094 --> 00:12:11,257
So unless you have another excuse...

147
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:14,696
l'll need your hands for this.

148
00:12:20,005 --> 00:12:22,200
[sighs]

149
00:12:42,795 --> 00:12:45,059
[grunts]

150
00:12:45,131 --> 00:12:46,621
So when did you find out?

151
00:12:47,967 --> 00:12:50,401
- What?
- About the baby.

152
00:12:57,309 --> 00:13:00,278
Um... Two days ago.

153
00:13:08,988 --> 00:13:11,616
- She hasn't told her mum yet...
- Shh.

154
00:13:15,561 --> 00:13:17,961
What, should l not tell her?

155
00:13:22,334 --> 00:13:25,098
What? What is it?

156
00:13:28,274 --> 00:13:29,605
l'm sorry. Um...

157
00:13:30,276 --> 00:13:33,905
l can't... l can't... [gasps]

158
00:13:33,979 --> 00:13:35,970
What were you gonna...?
What did you see?

159
00:13:36,048 --> 00:13:39,415
- l'm not doing this reading.
- No, you were gonna say something.

160
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:42,386
You'll have to leave. Now.

161
00:13:44,423 --> 00:13:45,981
Thanks, thanks very much.

162
00:13:52,698 --> 00:13:55,064
What a freak.

163
00:14:09,448 --> 00:14:10,847
[shrieks]

164
00:14:14,053 --> 00:14:16,783
[Claire screaming] Help me!

165
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:20,815
Somebody's trying to hurt me!
Please! Help me!

166
00:14:23,128 --> 00:14:24,857
- Someone attacked her!
- What?

167
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:27,262
- He held me down!
- [Charlie] Which way did he go?

168
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:29,198
- l couldn't see...
- What's going on?

169
00:14:29,268 --> 00:14:31,395
Just now! He just ran away!

170
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:33,335
Fan out, check the surrounding caves.

171
00:14:33,405 --> 00:14:35,805
- Wait, wait, hold on.
- Hurley, come on, let's go.

172
00:14:36,308 --> 00:14:39,072
Come on. Come on.
Let's sit down here, okay?

173
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:41,274
- Can you get her some water?
- Sure.

174
00:14:41,847 --> 00:14:44,839
Claire, look at me.
lt's okay. You're safe now.

175
00:14:44,917 --> 00:14:47,886
- Did you get a look at him at all?
- lt was dark. l couldn't see.

176
00:14:47,953 --> 00:14:50,547
- Where did this happen?
- [sobbing] He was here!

177
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:53,524
l mean, l was sleeping,
and l woke up,

178
00:14:53,592 --> 00:14:56,356
and he was trying to hurt my baby!

179
00:14:56,428 --> 00:15:00,023
He had this thing, like a needle,

180
00:15:00,099 --> 00:15:02,829
and he stabbed me with it!

181
00:15:05,037 --> 00:15:07,631
He was trying to hurt my baby.

182
00:15:08,641 --> 00:15:11,201
lt's okay. lt's okay.

183
00:15:16,548 --> 00:15:19,210
We hoofed around
the entire perimeter, man.

184
00:15:19,285 --> 00:15:23,722
- Nobody saw or heard anything?
- Uh-uh. Nada. Everyone was asleep.

185
00:15:23,789 --> 00:15:26,280
So, l had an idea.

186
00:15:26,358 --> 00:15:29,885
l'm out here looking for some psycho
with Scott and Steve, right?

187
00:15:29,962 --> 00:15:33,056
And l'm realizing,
who the hell are Scott and Steve?

188
00:15:33,132 --> 00:15:35,600
- l'm not following you.
- Look, if l was a cop,

189
00:15:35,668 --> 00:15:38,364
and some woman got attacked,
we'd canvas, right?

190
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:41,565
Knock on doors, find witnesses.
But we don't even have doors.

191
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:43,631
You're not helping me understand...

192
00:15:43,709 --> 00:15:45,768
We don't know who's living here,

193
00:15:45,844 --> 00:15:47,505
and who's still at the beach.

194
00:15:47,579 --> 00:15:49,479
l mean, we don't
even know each other.

195
00:15:49,548 --> 00:15:52,073
My name isn't Hurley.
lt's Hugo Reyes.

196
00:15:52,718 --> 00:15:55,380
Hurley's just a nickname
l have, all right?

197
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:57,251
Why? l'm not telling.

198
00:15:57,323 --> 00:15:59,883
The point is, we got
to find out who everyone is.

199
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:01,927
- You want to start a census?
- A registry.

200
00:16:01,994 --> 00:16:04,485
Names, what people look like,
who's related to who.

201
00:16:04,563 --> 00:16:07,657
We lay down the law,
people will stop attacking each other.

202
00:16:07,733 --> 00:16:10,793
Seems like someone's punched
or stabbed every other day.

203
00:16:10,869 --> 00:16:13,702
We got to find out
who did this to her.

204
00:16:24,683 --> 00:16:26,548
You all right?

205
00:16:34,059 --> 00:16:35,993
Don't worry.

206
00:16:36,061 --> 00:16:39,963
lf you want to close your eyes,
l'll be here all night.

207
00:16:40,966 --> 00:16:42,831
l won't let anyone get to you.

208
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:48,098
l won't leave you, Claire.

209
00:16:48,173 --> 00:16:50,368
Promise.

210
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:53,474
[door slams]

211
00:16:59,885 --> 00:17:03,218
- Wow, we have drapes now.
- l know.

212
00:17:03,288 --> 00:17:05,483
l feel all grown up.

213
00:17:05,557 --> 00:17:08,890
- [giggles] You like 'em?
- Yeah. They're good.

214
00:17:09,561 --> 00:17:13,258
l don't know why drapes
represent age for me.

215
00:17:13,332 --> 00:17:16,062
l guess it just feels like
something my mum would do.

216
00:17:16,335 --> 00:17:18,326
Oh, um, Sasha called.

217
00:17:18,404 --> 00:17:21,862
They're going out tonight.
They wanted to know if we'd go.

218
00:17:26,745 --> 00:17:27,803
[Claire] What?

219
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:31,213
l didn't eat all the chips.
There's another bag.

220
00:17:35,087 --> 00:17:38,716
Claire? l can't do this.

221
00:17:40,492 --> 00:17:44,121
Do what?
Did you have a bad day?

222
00:17:49,168 --> 00:17:51,898
This isn't working.

223
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:55,305
- Come on, you knew that.
- l what?

224
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:08,410
Just so l'm not overreacting here,

225
00:18:08,487 --> 00:18:10,512
are you breaking up with me?

226
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:14,423
For the past three months, it's just,
there's some plan, some responsibility,

227
00:18:14,493 --> 00:18:17,155
somewhere we have to be,
someone you have to talk to.

228
00:18:17,229 --> 00:18:19,459
l'm trying to make sure
when the baby comes...

229
00:18:19,531 --> 00:18:23,228
''When the baby...'' Yeah.
l mean, that is just not...

230
00:18:23,302 --> 00:18:25,793
lf it's like this now, you know,

231
00:18:25,871 --> 00:18:28,601
what's it gonna be like
when the baby comes?

232
00:18:28,674 --> 00:18:31,871
- But you said we should do this.
- Yeah.

233
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:35,072
Yeah, well, now it's real.

234
00:18:35,147 --> 00:18:36,944
You can't just change your mind.

235
00:18:37,015 --> 00:18:40,041
How in the hell am l
supposed to be a dad, Claire?

236
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:41,916
How about my painting? My life?

237
00:18:41,987 --> 00:18:44,319
l knew... l knew
this was gonna happen.

238
00:18:44,389 --> 00:18:47,916
l told you so. Perfect. Now l get
all your daddy abandonment crap.

239
00:18:47,993 --> 00:18:51,588
Hey, you bastard, don't you dare try
and justify what you're doing!

240
00:18:51,663 --> 00:18:54,131
l have done nothing!
l've done absolutely nothing.

241
00:18:54,199 --> 00:18:55,427
What, l have?

242
00:18:55,501 --> 00:18:57,594
You don't think
l've seen what you've done?

243
00:18:57,669 --> 00:19:01,002
- Excuse me?
- You were supposed to be on the Pill.

244
00:19:01,607 --> 00:19:05,008
- You think l got pregnant on purpose?
- l don't even care.

245
00:19:05,077 --> 00:19:07,875
Or that this was some kind of plan?
You are out of your mind!

246
00:19:07,946 --> 00:19:10,278
- lt's over, Claire!
- No, it's not over!

247
00:19:10,349 --> 00:19:12,249
- l'm out of here.
- Thomas!

248
00:19:14,786 --> 00:19:16,981
[door slams]

249
00:19:26,765 --> 00:19:29,256
John, right? John Locke?

250
00:19:30,269 --> 00:19:32,066
ls this about your census?

251
00:19:32,137 --> 00:19:35,300
Yeah, you know, l thought
it would be a good idea, you know,

252
00:19:35,374 --> 00:19:38,775
get everyone's name
and place of residence.

253
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:40,971
And who's checking on you?

254
00:19:41,747 --> 00:19:44,614
Uh, me.

255
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:46,742
lt was a joke.

256
00:19:49,288 --> 00:19:52,985
- Uh, good one.
- Yep.

257
00:19:53,058 --> 00:19:54,685
You already know my name.

258
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:58,389
l lived most of my life
in Tustin, California.

259
00:19:58,463 --> 00:20:01,830
Cool. And reason for travel?

260
00:20:02,334 --> 00:20:05,462
The reason you were in Australia?

261
00:20:05,537 --> 00:20:08,995
- l was looking for something.
- Looking. Uh-huh.

262
00:20:09,074 --> 00:20:10,974
Right on.

263
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:13,443
Something.

264
00:20:13,512 --> 00:20:15,776
So, did you find it?

265
00:20:17,983 --> 00:20:19,951
No, it found me.

266
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:26,324
- Anything else?
- No, no, that's good.

267
00:20:26,391 --> 00:20:27,983
Uh, thanks.

268
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:30,358
Hey, uh, l know
l already talked to you,

269
00:20:30,429 --> 00:20:32,795
but l just wanted to get
away from him for a second.

270
00:20:32,864 --> 00:20:35,594
Did you see anyone
leave the beach last night?

271
00:20:35,667 --> 00:20:37,794
People come and go, but...

272
00:20:37,869 --> 00:20:40,269
No, l don't know.

273
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:42,631
What?

274
00:20:42,708 --> 00:20:45,199
- l'm not sure anything happened.
- Wait, what?

275
00:20:46,478 --> 00:20:48,639
Claire told Michael
and l that this attacker

276
00:20:48,714 --> 00:20:52,172
tried to inject her with something.
But there was no mark on her stomach.

277
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:55,448
She wakes up two nights screaming.
First time, sleepwalking.

278
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,852
Think she's making this up?
She was terrified.

279
00:20:57,923 --> 00:21:00,756
She said he was hurting her baby.
Why would someone do that

280
00:21:00,859 --> 00:21:02,986
- with us 20 feet away?
- You think she's lying?

281
00:21:03,028 --> 00:21:05,394
No. Pregnant woman
have extremely lucid...

282
00:21:05,464 --> 00:21:07,432
- Lucid.
- Textbook anxiety nightmares.

283
00:21:07,499 --> 00:21:10,059
You know everything that's
going on with everyone?

284
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:14,931
So, what do we do?

285
00:21:15,007 --> 00:21:18,374
Claire's due in a little more
than a week. Maybe two.

286
00:21:18,443 --> 00:21:20,502
But if she stays
stressed out like this

287
00:21:20,579 --> 00:21:23,639
or has another panic attack,
it could trigger an early labor.

288
00:21:23,715 --> 00:21:28,311
Out here with no instruments,
no monitors, no anesthetic...

289
00:21:29,655 --> 00:21:32,556
That would not be good.

290
00:21:32,624 --> 00:21:35,092
lt's not all in her head.

291
00:21:41,633 --> 00:21:44,500
- Hey, Lance.
- Sorry?

292
00:21:44,569 --> 00:21:47,060
Lance. Your name's Lance, right?

293
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:49,573
- Ethan.
- Dude, that's right.

294
00:21:49,641 --> 00:21:51,905
Lance is a skinny guy
with glasses and red hair.

295
00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:54,537
l can see how you'd confuse us.

296
00:21:54,613 --> 00:21:57,605
Sorry, dude.
Lots of names and faces.

297
00:21:57,683 --> 00:22:00,345
Pathetic. You'd think
after a couple weeks on the island

298
00:22:00,452 --> 00:22:02,511
with the same people,
we'd know each other.

299
00:22:02,554 --> 00:22:05,955
- You're right. You would think so.
- So we're doing this list,

300
00:22:06,024 --> 00:22:08,925
all the survivors' names,
home addresses, stuff like that.

301
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:10,825
Okay, well,
you already have my name.

302
00:22:10,896 --> 00:22:13,490
- All right, not Lance.
- Definitely not.

303
00:22:13,565 --> 00:22:15,965
- Last name?
- Rom.

304
00:22:16,034 --> 00:22:18,434
- Rom, R-O-M?
- That's right.

305
00:22:18,503 --> 00:22:20,835
- Great. Where you from, Ethan Rom?
- Ontario.

306
00:22:20,906 --> 00:22:24,307
Right on. Love Canada. Great, uh...

307
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:29,370
Well, that should do it.
Thanks for your time, dude.

308
00:22:29,448 --> 00:22:31,712
- Hey, what's this for?
- Oh, it's nothing.

309
00:22:31,783 --> 00:22:34,547
Just, you know,
thought it'd be a good idea.

310
00:22:39,958 --> 00:22:41,949
[Jack] Claire?

311
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:44,393
Did you find him?

312
00:22:44,463 --> 00:22:47,364
- Um, no.
- What if he comes back?

313
00:22:50,068 --> 00:22:51,535
Claire...

314
00:22:53,305 --> 00:22:55,034
This situation that we're in,

315
00:22:55,107 --> 00:22:59,373
the crash, that no one's coming,
this place,

316
00:22:59,444 --> 00:23:01,776
it can kind of mess
with your head a little

317
00:23:01,847 --> 00:23:04,338
and make you see things
that aren't actually there.

318
00:23:04,416 --> 00:23:07,078
Now, l know it feels very real...

319
00:23:07,152 --> 00:23:11,521
- l don't under...
- Look, your baby's coming.

320
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:13,888
Soon.

321
00:23:13,959 --> 00:23:16,757
And l can't even imagine
how scary that must be for you.

322
00:23:16,828 --> 00:23:22,528
But the more upset you are, the more
dangerous it is for you, and your baby.

323
00:23:23,402 --> 00:23:26,929
So l want you to take these.

324
00:23:27,005 --> 00:23:29,838
- What are they?
- lt's a sedative.

325
00:23:29,908 --> 00:23:33,867
Very mild, commonly used
in situations like yours.

326
00:23:33,945 --> 00:23:38,075
lt won't harm the baby. l promise.

327
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:39,947
You don't believe me.

328
00:23:41,119 --> 00:23:44,577
- Claire...
- You think l'm making this up?

329
00:23:45,657 --> 00:23:48,285
l get attacked, and you want
to give me sleeping pills?

330
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:51,420
They're not sleeping...
Look, it's a very mild sedative.

331
00:23:51,496 --> 00:23:53,760
- l'm leaving.
- What? No! Claire. Claire...

332
00:23:53,832 --> 00:23:56,733
lt was safe at the beach.
lt's not safe here.

333
00:23:56,802 --> 00:24:01,705
- Don't do this. Think about the baby.
- Don't talk to me about the baby.

334
00:24:01,773 --> 00:24:04,970
l'm sick of everyone telling me
what to do. Let go of me.

335
00:24:06,178 --> 00:24:08,738
You okay?

336
00:24:10,816 --> 00:24:13,011
What did you say to her?

337
00:24:21,159 --> 00:24:23,457
[knocking]

338
00:24:30,168 --> 00:24:33,604
- Yes?
- Mr. Malkin, we met before?

339
00:24:33,672 --> 00:24:37,904
- Yes, l remember.
- You wouldn't give me a reading.

340
00:24:37,976 --> 00:24:40,137
l was hoping you would now.

341
00:24:49,888 --> 00:24:52,152
lf you're a psychic,
why do you have to count it?

342
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:56,524
- That's not how it works.
- l was just joking.

343
00:25:05,437 --> 00:25:08,133
[sighs]

344
00:25:08,607 --> 00:25:11,667
So... how does it work?

345
00:25:12,377 --> 00:25:14,368
l don't know.

346
00:25:23,121 --> 00:25:25,316
When did he leave you?

347
00:25:27,325 --> 00:25:28,849
Last week.

348
00:25:30,795 --> 00:25:32,786
ls that why you
didn't want to do my reading?

349
00:25:32,864 --> 00:25:36,823
No, no, no. l saw something,
sort of a blurry thing.

350
00:25:36,902 --> 00:25:39,996
And blurry's bad?

351
00:25:40,071 --> 00:25:42,232
Blurry's bad.

352
00:25:42,307 --> 00:25:44,741
That's why l stopped the reading.

353
00:25:44,809 --> 00:25:47,505
Are you sure you want
to go on now?

354
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:53,207
Yes, please.

355
00:26:10,101 --> 00:26:12,797
[panting]

356
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,738
l can tell you,

357
00:26:17,809 --> 00:26:19,367
this is important.

358
00:26:20,545 --> 00:26:25,141
- Okay.
- lt is crucial that you, yourself,

359
00:26:25,216 --> 00:26:26,547
raise this child.

360
00:26:27,786 --> 00:26:29,413
You mean with Thomas? ls he...?

361
00:26:29,487 --> 00:26:33,218
The father of this child will play
no part in its life, nor yours.

362
00:26:34,492 --> 00:26:38,792
- So, what exactly are you saying?
- This child parented by anyone else,

363
00:26:38,863 --> 00:26:40,888
anyone other than you...

364
00:26:43,335 --> 00:26:46,463
- Danger surrounds this baby.
- Danger?

365
00:26:46,538 --> 00:26:48,972
Your nature, your spirit,

366
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:52,669
your goodness must be an influence
in the development of this child.

367
00:26:57,215 --> 00:27:02,243
Look, if Thomas and l don't,
you know, get back together,

368
00:27:02,354 --> 00:27:05,414
l'm putting this baby
up for adoption.

369
00:27:05,457 --> 00:27:09,393
l just wanted to find out what would
give the baby the happiest life.

370
00:27:09,461 --> 00:27:14,398
There is no happy life.
Not for this child, not without you.

371
00:27:14,466 --> 00:27:17,629
- l don't...
- There can't be another.

372
00:27:17,702 --> 00:27:19,966
You mustn't allow another
to raise your baby.

373
00:27:20,038 --> 00:27:23,565
Okay. Great.
Thanks for taking my 200.

374
00:27:23,642 --> 00:27:27,908
Look, take it. Miss Littleton,
l am begging you just to consider...

375
00:27:27,979 --> 00:27:31,437
- l can't raise this child by myself.
- You have to listen to me!

376
00:27:31,516 --> 00:27:33,484
Thanks for your time
and my money back!

377
00:27:33,551 --> 00:27:36,577
The baby needs your protection!

378
00:27:38,323 --> 00:27:41,190
Miss Littleton! Please!

379
00:27:44,462 --> 00:27:46,589
[phone rings]

380
00:27:53,605 --> 00:27:56,540
- Hello?
- <i>Miss Littleton, it's Richard Malkin.</i>

381
00:27:56,608 --> 00:27:59,736
- Oh, my God.
- <i>Listen to me. I have a plan,</i>

382
00:27:59,811 --> 00:28:01,938
<i>something that will</i>
<i>make this all better.</i>

383
00:28:02,013 --> 00:28:05,107
You've got to stop calling me.
lt's too late, all right?

384
00:28:05,183 --> 00:28:07,413
l'm going to see
Adoptive Services tomorrow.

385
00:28:07,485 --> 00:28:10,386
<i>I've been telling you for months,</i>
<i>you cannot do that.</i>

386
00:28:10,455 --> 00:28:12,980
What l do with my baby
is none of your business.

387
00:28:13,058 --> 00:28:14,821
<i>If you don't do</i>
<i>what I'm suggesting,</i>

388
00:28:14,893 --> 00:28:16,554
<i>great danger will befall...</i>

389
00:28:16,628 --> 00:28:19,620
Great danger will befall you
if you don't stop calling me

390
00:28:19,698 --> 00:28:22,792
- in the middle of the night.
- <i>I know what you're feeling inside.</i>

391
00:28:22,867 --> 00:28:25,301
<i>You're doubting your decision</i>
<i>to give up the baby.</i>

392
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:28,862
<i>Look, I'm begging you, don't do it.</i>
<i>At least hear my plan first.</i>

393
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:30,965
Good night.

394
00:28:36,848 --> 00:28:38,679
[Charlie] Hi.

395
00:28:39,517 --> 00:28:42,748
- Where are you going?
- Back to the beach.

396
00:28:42,821 --> 00:28:47,019
- Well, what happened? Did Jack...?
- Jack tried to dope me.

397
00:28:47,092 --> 00:28:50,493
He thinks l'm making all this up,
that none of it really happened.

398
00:28:50,562 --> 00:28:53,258
Right. So, to prove your sanity,

399
00:28:53,331 --> 00:28:57,233
you go tromping through
the jungle alone. Well done.

400
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:04,065
l'm not crazy, Charlie.

401
00:29:13,184 --> 00:29:15,982
You want my information?

402
00:29:16,054 --> 00:29:18,113
Name<i>:</i> Shannon Rutherford.

403
00:29:18,189 --> 00:29:21,955
Age<i>:</i> 20.
Address<i>:</i> Craphole lsland.

404
00:29:22,026 --> 00:29:25,962
So, uh, where were
you guys last night?

405
00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:28,123
Um, the beach.

406
00:29:29,134 --> 00:29:31,102
Why the interrogation?

407
00:29:31,169 --> 00:29:33,729
You're like the twentieth person
to ask me that.

408
00:29:33,805 --> 00:29:36,365
Why is everyone uptight
about answering questions?

409
00:29:36,441 --> 00:29:38,636
Well, maybe we're just
not cool with you

410
00:29:38,710 --> 00:29:41,440
setting up your own
little Patriot Act, man.

411
00:29:41,513 --> 00:29:43,572
He's a liberal.

412
00:29:44,716 --> 00:29:46,775
- Seriously, why the list?
- lt's nothing.

413
00:29:46,851 --> 00:29:48,944
We had an incident
in the valley last night.

414
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:51,420
- An incident?
- Yeah, Claire, the pregnant girl.

415
00:29:51,489 --> 00:29:56,119
You know her?
She, uh, kind of got attacked.

416
00:29:56,194 --> 00:29:58,560
- What?
- She okay?

417
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:02,657
- Yeah, she's a little shook up, but...
- l am not moving to the Rape Caves.

418
00:30:04,035 --> 00:30:06,936
Your life would be much easier
if you just had the manifest.

419
00:30:07,005 --> 00:30:09,974
We crossed out names of the dead
after we burned the fuselage,

420
00:30:10,041 --> 00:30:12,134
so should be a full roster
of the rest of us.

421
00:30:12,210 --> 00:30:14,337
What? Really? Who has it?

422
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:17,341
Who do you think?

423
00:30:27,225 --> 00:30:29,989
l'm just gonna lay it out straight.

424
00:30:30,061 --> 00:30:31,653
Okay, you do that.

425
00:30:31,729 --> 00:30:33,993
l hear you have
the flight manifest,

426
00:30:34,065 --> 00:30:36,932
and l need it
and want you to give it to me.

427
00:30:37,936 --> 00:30:40,996
- That so?
- Now, you could do what you normally do

428
00:30:41,072 --> 00:30:43,666
when someone asks for something,
tell me to screw off.

429
00:30:43,741 --> 00:30:49,043
- Screw off?
- Or you could just give it to me.

430
00:30:50,281 --> 00:30:54,115
'Cause, dude,
you could use the points.

431
00:30:56,354 --> 00:30:59,551
Well, gosh, you sure know how
to butter a man up, Stay-Puff.

432
00:30:59,624 --> 00:31:01,649
lt's a gift.

433
00:31:02,927 --> 00:31:05,054
[chuckles]

434
00:31:06,197 --> 00:31:10,031
Manifest is in
the brown suitcase. Take it.

435
00:31:12,203 --> 00:31:14,501
- Please let me carry your bag.
- l'm fine.

436
00:31:14,572 --> 00:31:16,665
l know you're fine,
but l can carry your bag.

437
00:31:16,741 --> 00:31:18,470
Why did you come after me?

438
00:31:18,543 --> 00:31:22,001
Well, it's probably
because l like you.

439
00:31:22,947 --> 00:31:26,815
- What?
- You don't like me, Charlie, okay?

440
00:31:26,885 --> 00:31:29,683
You just want
to rescue me because l'm...

441
00:31:29,754 --> 00:31:31,881
Because of this.

442
00:31:31,956 --> 00:31:35,687
But l'm fine, okay? l don't
need rescuing. l don't need...

443
00:31:36,527 --> 00:31:38,427
- Claire? What is it?
- [gasping]

444
00:31:39,297 --> 00:31:42,266
What? Claire, what?
What is it?

445
00:31:49,073 --> 00:31:50,938
- Was that another one?
- Yeah.

446
00:31:51,009 --> 00:31:53,569
We need to time the contractions.
That's what you do.

447
00:31:53,645 --> 00:31:57,741
Time the contractions, okay? One sugar
plum fairy, two sugar plum fairy...

448
00:31:57,815 --> 00:32:00,545
You just need to calm down,
all right? Big deep breaths.

449
00:32:03,821 --> 00:32:05,914
- Bloody hell.
- l need you to go get Jack.

450
00:32:05,990 --> 00:32:08,356
- l'll be all right.
- l'm not leaving you alone.

451
00:32:08,426 --> 00:32:10,860
- l can deliver a baby. l can do this.
- Please, go!

452
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:12,760
- You don't know how to...
- Listen.

453
00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:15,321
l might not know what l'm doing,
but l'll figure it out.

454
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:18,460
lf l can kick drugs,
l can deliver a baby.

455
00:32:18,536 --> 00:32:23,064
Let me explain. l'm a drug addict.
l was a drug addict. l'm clean now.

456
00:32:23,141 --> 00:32:25,837
- Get Jack!
- Right.

457
00:32:37,956 --> 00:32:40,754
[man] Arlene and Joseph
will bring you to Melbourne.

458
00:32:40,825 --> 00:32:43,919
They'll pay your
living and medical expenses.

459
00:32:43,995 --> 00:32:47,829
We found you an apartment.
lt's a really nice two-bedroom place,

460
00:32:47,899 --> 00:32:50,766
and we think you're
gonna be really comfortable in it.

461
00:32:50,835 --> 00:32:54,464
As discussed, once the baby's born
and handed over to the Stewarts,

462
00:32:54,539 --> 00:32:56,769
you'll have no right
to see the child again.

463
00:32:56,841 --> 00:32:59,435
You'll have no right
to correspond with the child,

464
00:32:59,544 --> 00:33:01,603
it will be entirely up
to Arlene and Joseph

465
00:33:01,646 --> 00:33:05,980
to decide whether to tell the child
anything about you. Understood?

466
00:33:07,385 --> 00:33:10,115
- Yes.
- Upon your discharge from the hospital,

467
00:33:10,188 --> 00:33:13,954
you will be given an
additional payment of $20,000.

468
00:33:16,995 --> 00:33:20,590
l just want to make sure that you're
gonna take really good care of the baby.

469
00:33:20,665 --> 00:33:23,828
Of course we will.

470
00:33:23,901 --> 00:33:28,304
Now, l'll need you to sign
and date here where indicated.

471
00:33:36,547 --> 00:33:40,813
Do you know <i>Catch a Falling Star?</i>

472
00:33:40,885 --> 00:33:42,785
lt's a song, like a lullaby.

473
00:33:42,854 --> 00:33:45,652
''Catch a falling star
and put it in your pocket.''

474
00:33:47,525 --> 00:33:51,017
My dad used to sing
that to me when l was little.

475
00:33:52,296 --> 00:33:57,233
Do you think you could sing it
to the baby once in a while?

476
00:33:57,301 --> 00:34:00,327
Of course.

477
00:34:14,752 --> 00:34:17,550
lt's not working.

478
00:34:17,622 --> 00:34:19,487
Here.

479
00:34:49,887 --> 00:34:51,684
l'm...

480
00:34:51,756 --> 00:34:53,883
l'm... l'm sorry.

481
00:34:53,958 --> 00:34:59,555
- l can't do this.
- [Arlene] What? No! No!

482
00:35:05,470 --> 00:35:09,201
Okay, what is it?
What's your offer?

483
00:35:17,915 --> 00:35:21,476
- Thank God! What's your name?
- Ethan. Are you all right?

484
00:35:21,552 --> 00:35:23,611
Go the caves.
Run to the caves. Get Jack.

485
00:35:23,688 --> 00:35:25,588
- Tell him Claire...
- Claire. She okay?

486
00:35:25,656 --> 00:35:29,422
She's having the baby. Go fast, okay?
l'll be with her, on the path there. Go!

487
00:35:45,610 --> 00:35:47,942
- Claire!
- l'm here!

488
00:35:48,012 --> 00:35:50,742
Claire! Okay, Jack's coming.

489
00:35:50,815 --> 00:35:52,840
- How you doing?
- lt hurts.

490
00:35:52,917 --> 00:35:55,977
Okay, just take my hand.
Squeeze. Okay, breathe.

491
00:35:56,053 --> 00:36:00,490
lnhale. Exhale.
Good. Just breathe.

492
00:36:02,693 --> 00:36:04,923
lnhale. Okay, good.

493
00:36:04,996 --> 00:36:08,762
- Oh, l'm not supposed to be here.
- We all feel like that a little bit.

494
00:36:08,833 --> 00:36:11,700
[stammering] l know. lt's just...

495
00:36:11,769 --> 00:36:14,169
Someone promised me
it would be different.

496
00:36:14,238 --> 00:36:17,639
Well, he was wrong.

497
00:36:19,310 --> 00:36:21,710
Yeah. He was wrong.

498
00:36:21,779 --> 00:36:24,407
You spent the last
four months telling me

499
00:36:24,482 --> 00:36:26,780
l have to raise the baby myself.

500
00:36:26,851 --> 00:36:29,513
Now you're giving me money
and saying l don't have to?

501
00:36:29,587 --> 00:36:33,148
l found a couple in Los Angeles
who are very eager to adopt.

502
00:36:33,224 --> 00:36:36,057
The baby will be safe in their care.

503
00:36:36,127 --> 00:36:38,891
- Now, l've foreseen...
- You've foreseen.

504
00:36:38,963 --> 00:36:41,158
l don't even know
why l'm here. l'm sorry.

505
00:36:41,232 --> 00:36:45,100
l know this sounds ridiculous,
Claire, all this psychic business,

506
00:36:45,169 --> 00:36:49,196
and l appreciate that you must
think l'm a raving madman.

507
00:36:49,273 --> 00:36:52,538
But this is what must happen.

508
00:36:55,279 --> 00:36:59,409
So you're giving me $6,000

509
00:36:59,483 --> 00:37:03,385
to give my baby to a couple
of strangers in Los Angeles?

510
00:37:03,454 --> 00:37:07,891
$1 2,000. The other six
when you arrive in Los Angeles.

511
00:37:07,959 --> 00:37:11,725
And they're not strangers, Claire.
They're good people.

512
00:37:14,966 --> 00:37:19,733
- A psychic?
- l know. lt's embarrassing.

513
00:37:19,804 --> 00:37:24,104
And after everything,
he was just full of it.

514
00:37:30,381 --> 00:37:31,780
Or not.

515
00:37:33,284 --> 00:37:36,583
l mean, all he wanted

516
00:37:36,654 --> 00:37:38,815
was that no one else
raise your baby, right?

517
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:44,560
Maybe he knew.

518
00:37:45,296 --> 00:37:48,629
l mean,
if you wanted it bad enough...

519
00:37:48,699 --> 00:37:52,260
You know, if he had the gift,

520
00:37:52,336 --> 00:37:54,770
and l believe some people do...

521
00:37:55,873 --> 00:37:58,603
Maybe he knew, Claire.

522
00:38:11,455 --> 00:38:14,151
l can't go tomorrow.
l have to get my...

523
00:38:14,225 --> 00:38:16,819
lt has to be this flight.
lt can't be any other.

524
00:38:16,894 --> 00:38:20,990
They're already scheduled to meet you
when you arrive. Flight 81 5.

525
00:38:21,065 --> 00:38:23,397
Flight 81 5.

526
00:38:32,243 --> 00:38:36,612
There was no couple in Los Angeles.

527
00:38:38,349 --> 00:38:40,476
[Claire] <i>He knew.</i>

528
00:38:40,951 --> 00:38:43,283
<i>He knew about the plane,</i>

529
00:38:43,354 --> 00:38:45,515
<i>what was gonna happen...</i>

530
00:38:47,658 --> 00:38:50,126
<i>Oh, my God, he knew.</i>

531
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:06,868
- You feel another one coming?
- l don't think so.

532
00:39:10,281 --> 00:39:11,976
Where the hell is Jack?

533
00:39:14,251 --> 00:39:17,516
You know, l think...

534
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:21,715
- l think l'm all right.
- The contractions?

535
00:39:22,259 --> 00:39:24,887
Maybe that was the last one.

536
00:39:24,962 --> 00:39:27,829
Please, let that
have been the last one.

537
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:34,636
Jack said that stress
can cause a false labor.

538
00:39:35,139 --> 00:39:37,403
You sure you're all right?

539
00:39:38,242 --> 00:39:39,539
No pain.

540
00:39:42,179 --> 00:39:45,512
Birthing emergency averted.

541
00:39:45,583 --> 00:39:47,744
l told you l'd take care of you.

542
00:39:48,085 --> 00:39:51,612
- Thanks, Charlie.
- You're quite welcome.

543
00:39:54,458 --> 00:39:56,756
You think you can
make it back to the caves?

544
00:39:59,797 --> 00:40:01,890
l won't let anything happen to you.

545
00:40:06,337 --> 00:40:08,362
- Okay.
- Okay.

546
00:40:08,439 --> 00:40:10,270
Let's go.

547
00:40:13,644 --> 00:40:15,407
[Jack] Sayid.

548
00:40:15,479 --> 00:40:16,969
Listen to me.

549
00:40:22,853 --> 00:40:25,321
l found her, the Frenchwoman.

550
00:40:25,890 --> 00:40:27,915
l need some water.

551
00:40:27,992 --> 00:40:30,586
- What happened?
- The woman on the island...

552
00:40:35,166 --> 00:40:38,101
l had to come back.
l had to come back.

553
00:40:47,645 --> 00:40:49,579
We're not alone.

554
00:41:04,728 --> 00:41:06,628
[gasping]

555
00:41:06,697 --> 00:41:10,929
- You okay?
- Yeah, yeah, he just kicked.

556
00:41:11,268 --> 00:41:13,133
Here.

557
00:41:21,645 --> 00:41:23,272
We got a problem.

558
00:41:24,315 --> 00:41:26,442
The manifest.

559
00:41:26,517 --> 00:41:29,680
Jack, the census,
the names of everyone who survived.

560
00:41:29,753 --> 00:41:31,084
All 46 of us.

561
00:41:31,155 --> 00:41:33,988
l interviewed everyone,
here, at the beach.

562
00:41:34,058 --> 00:41:37,824
l got their names. One of them...
One of them isn't...

563
00:41:37,895 --> 00:41:40,420
Jack.

564
00:41:40,498 --> 00:41:43,331
One of them isn't in the manifest.

565
00:41:43,701 --> 00:41:45,965
He wasn't on the plane.

566
00:41:46,904 --> 00:41:48,997
[Ethan] Hello, there.

567
00:41:54,245 --> 00:41:56,213
Ethan, where's Jack?
