00:00:02,469 --> 00:00:04,528
Three points of a triangle.

00:00:04,604 --> 00:00:08,040
One here on the beach. Another,
Kate will position in the jungle

4
00:00:08,108 --> 00:00:10,338
roughly two kilometers in.

5
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:13,174
And the third,
l'll take to high ground.

00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:19,776
Where are you?
Where are you?

8
00:00:21,354 --> 00:00:25,484
Mayday! Mayday!
Anybody out there? Hello!

9
00:00:25,558 --> 00:00:28,686
We're survivors of the crash
of Oceanic flight 81 5.

10
00:00:28,762 --> 00:00:29,751
Please copy.

11
00:00:33,433 --> 00:00:35,901
John, tell me exactly
what happened.

12
00:00:37,103 --> 00:00:40,334
John? Locke!

13
00:00:40,407 --> 00:00:45,344
- [faint] lt fell... the plane.
- Locke said you fell from a cliff.

14
00:00:45,412 --> 00:00:48,381
- lt's because of the hatch.
- What hatch?

15
00:00:48,448 --> 00:00:51,110
John said not to tell.

16
00:00:52,652 --> 00:00:53,846
What'd Locke do?

17
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,547
- Where's Shannon?
- l don't know.

18
00:00:55,622 --> 00:00:58,250
- Well, she's his sister...
- l don't know where she is!

19
00:01:21,514 --> 00:01:25,416
Jack. Where are you going?

20
00:01:25,485 --> 00:01:27,510
To find John Locke.

21
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:00,442
ls there anything
l can do for you?

22
00:02:08,194 --> 00:02:11,789
Sun said he wouldn't let
Jack take his leg.

23
00:02:13,533 --> 00:02:16,127
Didn't want him using up
the antibiotics.

24
00:02:17,737 --> 00:02:22,071
She said he knew
what was happening to him.

25
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:24,133
That he was brave.

[unlocking handcuffs]

29
00:03:06,286 --> 00:03:07,947
Okay, Sayid.

30
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:11,184
[woman] Eighteen hours
in a holding cell should be enough.

31
00:03:11,257 --> 00:03:12,724
Let's get to it, shall we?

32
00:03:12,792 --> 00:03:15,022
l'm Melissa Cole
from Central lntelligence.

33
00:03:15,094 --> 00:03:17,790
[Cole] This is Robbie Hewitt from ASlS.

34
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:21,800
- You're gonna do us a favor.
- A favor?

35
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:24,632
Three hundred pounds
of C-4 explosives were stolen

36
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:26,831
from an army base
outside of Melbourne.

37
00:03:26,906 --> 00:03:29,602
The men responsible
are members of a terrorist cell

38
00:03:29,676 --> 00:03:32,736
intent on disrupting
the coalition presence in lraq.

39
00:03:32,812 --> 00:03:35,474
Three hundred pounds of C-4.

40
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:36,947
l want it back.

41
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:39,047
You're the ClA.

42
00:03:39,118 --> 00:03:41,086
- Plant a few bugs.
- Oh, we have.

43
00:03:41,154 --> 00:03:44,487
- You're gonna get inside first...
- l am lraqi.

44
00:03:44,557 --> 00:03:46,184
l am not a terrorist.

45
00:03:46,259 --> 00:03:49,524
[Cole] We didn't snatch you up
because you were a terrorist, Sayid.

46
00:03:49,596 --> 00:03:52,531
We snatched you up
because you know one.

47
00:03:55,101 --> 00:03:59,561
Essam Tazir.
Your roommate at Cairo University.

48
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:02,733
- [Hewitt] He's a member of the cell.
- And why should l care?

49
00:04:02,809 --> 00:04:05,505
- You'd be saving lives.
- l repeat. Why should l care?

50
00:04:05,578 --> 00:04:06,943
We know where she is.

51
00:04:11,184 --> 00:04:13,243
Seven years since you left lraq.

52
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:15,685
Six months here,
three months there.

53
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:17,188
[Cole] Always moving.

54
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:20,420
There's only two reasons
why a man would do that, Sayid.

55
00:04:20,493 --> 00:04:22,757
Either he's running away
from something,

56
00:04:22,829 --> 00:04:24,820
or looking for something.

57
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:29,258
[Cole] Noor Abed Jaseem.

58
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:38,403
Nobody calls her Noor.

59
00:04:38,478 --> 00:04:40,309
You want to know
where she is?

60
00:04:42,882 --> 00:04:44,907
Then we're going to Sydney.

61
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:11,504
[rustling]

62
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:19,175
[panting]
Kate, what are you doing out here?

63
00:05:19,252 --> 00:05:24,053
- Looking for you.
- Well, you found me.

64
00:05:25,925 --> 00:05:28,553
You're walking in circles.
You need to come back.

65
00:05:28,628 --> 00:05:30,095
Not without Locke.

66
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:33,724
- You haven't slept, gave Boone blood...
- Locke lied.

67
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:36,030
- Well, now you're...
- He lied, Kate.

68
00:05:38,671 --> 00:05:40,935
Boone did not fall off any cliff.

69
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:42,406
His leg was crushed.

70
00:05:42,475 --> 00:05:45,808
And l based my
medical treatment on his lie.

71
00:05:48,948 --> 00:05:50,939
People are scared and upset.

72
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:54,180
[Kate] They don't know what's going on.

73
00:05:55,054 --> 00:05:57,045
We need you to come back, Jack.

74
00:05:57,990 --> 00:05:59,116
[Kate] Please?

75
00:07:16,836 --> 00:07:18,895
[out of breath] Shannon.

76
00:07:18,971 --> 00:07:20,700
Do you wanna...?

77
00:07:21,641 --> 00:07:23,438
Do you wanna say something?

78
00:07:26,646 --> 00:07:27,977
No.

79
00:07:38,691 --> 00:07:41,819
[Sayid] l didn't know Boone very well,

80
00:07:41,894 --> 00:07:44,419
and for that l'm sorry.

81
00:07:48,201 --> 00:07:49,930
On our sixth day here,

82
00:07:50,002 --> 00:07:52,732
[Sayid] a woman named Joanna died.

83
00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:53,999
She drowned.

84
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:57,607
And Boone was the first one
into the water.

85
00:08:00,213 --> 00:08:01,840
l didn't know him.

86
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:06,418
[Sayid] But l'll remember his courage...

87
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:09,011
...and l know he will be missed.

88
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,055
[Locke] lt was my fault.

89
00:08:20,766 --> 00:08:25,635
We found a plane.
A Beechcraft, in the jungle.

90
00:08:25,705 --> 00:08:28,173
lt was lodged in the canopy.

91
00:08:30,643 --> 00:08:34,010
[stuttering] l would have gone up,
but...

92
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:42,116
My leg was hurt, so he...

93
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:52,461
There was a radio inside,
and he thought he could...

94
00:08:59,605 --> 00:09:02,836
His weight must have made
the plane shift and it fell and...

95
00:09:07,413 --> 00:09:10,075
Happened because
he was trying to help us.

96
00:09:13,085 --> 00:09:14,882
He was a hero.

97
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,884
[Jack] Where were you?

98
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:26,998
Where were you?

99
00:09:27,867 --> 00:09:30,301
Where the hell were you,
you son of a bitch?

100
00:09:30,369 --> 00:09:33,236
- What did you do to him?
- Wait! Jack, stop!

101
00:09:33,306 --> 00:09:35,501
- [Jack] What did you do?
- [Locke] Wait!

102
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:37,065
[Jack] Where were you?

103
00:09:37,143 --> 00:09:40,442
You just left him to die.
You lied to me!

104
00:09:40,513 --> 00:09:42,310
Where were you?

105
00:09:59,865 --> 00:10:02,265
- [Charlie] Jack, it's okay.
- Where were you?

106
00:10:02,335 --> 00:10:05,031
- Where were you?
- [Charlie] Jack.

107
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:07,095
- [Kate] Jack.
- Hey, hey.

108
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:10,401
Jack, what's the matter?
Are you okay?

109
00:10:10,476 --> 00:10:11,636
Oh, God.

110
00:10:11,711 --> 00:10:13,770
Get some water!

111
00:10:15,481 --> 00:10:17,642
Breathe. He's okay.

112
00:10:18,651 --> 00:10:20,175
[Charlie] Just breathe.

113
00:10:23,556 --> 00:10:26,491
- He's lying.
- You're suffering from fatigue.

114
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:29,892
- Locke told Boone not to tell.
- Not to tell about what?

115
00:10:29,962 --> 00:10:33,989
Something about a hatch.
Locke's hiding something.

116
00:10:34,066 --> 00:10:36,626
- Jack, listen...
- The man is hiding something.

117
00:10:36,702 --> 00:10:37,896
Listen to me.

118
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:40,837
We need the doctor
on this island to get some sleep.

119
00:10:40,906 --> 00:10:43,568
- l'm fine. l don't need it.
- Jack.

120
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:45,508
You need some rest.

121
00:10:46,512 --> 00:10:47,638
[Sun] Come on.

122
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:53,978
[man speaking Arabic]

123
00:11:29,422 --> 00:11:31,151
[man] Sayid?

124
00:11:31,223 --> 00:11:32,747
Sayid.

125
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:36,227
- lt is you.
- Essam.

126
00:11:36,295 --> 00:11:38,354
So you haven't forgotten me.

127
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:42,191
Hardly.

128
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:47,028
- What are you doing in Sydney?
- l've been traveling. And you?

129
00:11:47,106 --> 00:11:49,700
l live here.
Almost a year now.

130
00:11:49,775 --> 00:11:53,973
- l'm a tree cutter. l cut trees.
- Sounds like good, honest work.

131
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:55,980
So much for my philosophy degree.

132
00:11:56,048 --> 00:11:57,879
Whatever puts food on your table.

133
00:11:57,950 --> 00:11:59,611
How is Zahraa?

134
00:12:02,121 --> 00:12:03,418
She died.

135
00:12:06,058 --> 00:12:09,892
A stray bomb, while she
was shopping for a dress.

136
00:12:11,263 --> 00:12:13,197
l'm so sorry.

137
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,428
Listen, we've got
a lot of catching up to do.

138
00:12:17,503 --> 00:12:19,334
[Essam] Why don't you come over?

139
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,833
l'd love to.

140
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:25,138
[gun firing]

141
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:28,941
Damn it. l'm out of ammo.

142
00:12:29,014 --> 00:12:31,881
- Use the crowbar.
- That only works on the zombies.

143
00:12:31,951 --> 00:12:34,181
- Not the big bugs.
- lndeed.

144
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:35,686
The three of you live here?

145
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:38,690
Sydney's very expensive.
lt's the best we can afford.

146
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:41,090
And what is it you do?

147
00:12:41,961 --> 00:12:46,261
- At the moment, l'm at liberty.
- He's on holiday.

148
00:12:46,332 --> 00:12:47,993
You'll love the beaches here.

149
00:12:48,067 --> 00:12:51,002
[Essam] There is something to be said
for Australian women.

150
00:12:56,008 --> 00:12:59,967
l've had the misfortune of being
landlocked for several years.

151
00:13:00,045 --> 00:13:02,980
The last beach l was at
was Sharm El Sheikh

152
00:13:03,048 --> 00:13:04,913
with you, Essam, remember?

153
00:13:04,984 --> 00:13:06,884
Before our English exams?

154
00:13:06,952 --> 00:13:09,785
l hear the beaches here are very nice.

155
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:13,823
Especially the women.

156
00:13:16,862 --> 00:13:18,124
Perhaps we can go.

157
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:28,963
So tell me, exactly
what kind of trees do you cut?

158
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,916
- [man] Who are you?
- l was a communications officer.

159
00:13:37,983 --> 00:13:40,451
Sayid was Republican Guard.
He knows things.

160
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:49,158
Perhaps it's not happenstance

161
00:13:49,228 --> 00:13:51,355
that you and Essam
met at the mosque.

162
00:13:56,101 --> 00:13:59,696
Perhaps it is fate.

163
00:14:05,911 --> 00:14:07,105
lt's okay.

164
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:09,704
Look, l'm fine. Really. Okay?

165
00:14:09,782 --> 00:14:12,216
You need rest, Claire.
Sun, tell her.

166
00:14:12,284 --> 00:14:14,752
ln a hospital,
they would have you sleep.

167
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:16,685
The nurses would take your baby.

168
00:14:16,755 --> 00:14:18,120
But l'm not in a hospital.

169
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:21,990
All the more reason
to take extra care, Claire.

170
00:14:22,061 --> 00:14:24,325
l can take care of
Turnip-Head for a while.

171
00:14:24,396 --> 00:14:25,863
Turnip-Head?

172
00:14:25,931 --> 00:14:28,491
lt's what l'm calling him
till you give him a name.

173
00:14:28,567 --> 00:14:31,502
'Cause his head
looks like a turnip.

174
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:34,130
What if he needs something, okay?

175
00:14:34,206 --> 00:14:36,106
You'll be there after you sleep.

176
00:14:36,175 --> 00:14:37,938
No, okay. No.

177
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:44,807
Claire, no one is going to take
this baby away from you.

178
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:47,580
You don't know that.
You can't say that.

179
00:14:47,653 --> 00:14:49,416
l won't let it happen.

180
00:14:54,994 --> 00:14:57,053
Just be really careful, okay?

181
00:14:57,129 --> 00:14:59,529
lf he gets hot,
take his blanket off.

182
00:14:59,598 --> 00:15:03,034
- His neck. Around his neck.
- l got him.

183
00:15:16,515 --> 00:15:17,539
This was his.

184
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,844
[Locke] l didn't go through it.

185
00:15:26,859 --> 00:15:28,417
Thank you.

186
00:15:28,494 --> 00:15:29,825
You're welcome.

187
00:15:35,801 --> 00:15:38,599
[distant thunderhead]

188
00:15:38,671 --> 00:15:40,332
Storm coming.

189
00:15:46,512 --> 00:15:47,911
l should have said no.

190
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:52,945
First time he offered to hunt with me,
l should have said no.

191
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:57,346
He would've gone anyway.

192
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:01,153
Yeah, l suppose he would've.

193
00:16:07,266 --> 00:16:10,497
l know how confused and angry
you must be right now.

194
00:16:10,569 --> 00:16:14,266
l can't say l understand
what you're going through, but...

195
00:16:15,174 --> 00:16:18,007
l know what it feels like
when you lose family.

196
00:16:28,954 --> 00:16:31,013
l hope you can forgive me.

197
00:16:35,928 --> 00:16:37,725
l'm sorry.

198
00:16:59,084 --> 00:17:01,678
You asked if you could
do anything for me.

199
00:17:07,626 --> 00:17:09,526
Anything.

200
00:17:10,396 --> 00:17:12,159
John Locke killed my brother.

201
00:17:13,899 --> 00:17:16,367
Will you do something about that?

202
00:17:29,214 --> 00:17:31,808
- A little more.
- No.

203
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:35,547
- You need your blood sugar level up.
- Enough already. l've rested.

204
00:17:36,688 --> 00:17:37,916
- Jack...
- l'm fine.

205
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:39,651
Where are you going?

206
00:17:40,993 --> 00:17:43,484
- l'm gonna talk to Locke.
- You need to lie down.

207
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:46,725
- No, l don't.
- l strongly advise it.

208
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:49,461
You advise? Advice?

209
00:17:49,535 --> 00:17:52,060
What...?
All right, what's going on now?

210
00:17:52,137 --> 00:17:54,867
Lie down. Okay?

211
00:17:57,743 --> 00:18:02,442
l crushed up some sleeping pills,
put 'em in your juice.

212
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:06,779
Why would you...?
You drugged me?

213
00:18:07,719 --> 00:18:08,947
Yeah.

214
00:18:14,293 --> 00:18:15,624
[groan] Okay.

215
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:28,569
'Night.

216
00:18:55,534 --> 00:18:56,796
How did you get that?

217
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:03,605
War wound.

218
00:19:03,675 --> 00:19:07,873
- Looks more like a surgical scar.
- Like l said, war wound.

219
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:14,279
The plane's radio.
Was Boone able to pick up a signal?

220
00:19:14,353 --> 00:19:17,186
l was on the ground.
All l could hear was static.

221
00:19:17,256 --> 00:19:19,690
- So it was working.
- Yeah.

222
00:19:19,758 --> 00:19:22,056
But l can't imagine
it survived the fall.

223
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:28,023
Some of its parts might work in the
transmitter l'm building for the raft...

224
00:19:30,102 --> 00:19:31,967
...if you'd be willing to take me.

225
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:35,238
Of course.

226
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:40,744
- [Sayid] How did you find this plane?
- [Locke] Luck.

227
00:19:40,812 --> 00:19:42,302
You and Boone were hunting?

228
00:19:42,381 --> 00:19:46,112
- That a question?
- Yes.

229
00:19:46,985 --> 00:19:49,476
Boar got scarce
a couple weeks back.

230
00:19:49,555 --> 00:19:51,682
We weren't hunting,
we were exploring.

231
00:19:51,757 --> 00:19:54,988
So you just happened upon
a Beechcraft perched in the trees?

232
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:56,391
Yep.

233
00:19:57,930 --> 00:20:00,660
At the funeral, you said
your leg was injured.

234
00:20:00,732 --> 00:20:03,098
lt was just a charley horse.

235
00:20:03,769 --> 00:20:07,330
- A cramp.
- l know what a charley horse is, John.

236
00:20:09,675 --> 00:20:12,371
Back in lraq,
you were an interrogator?

237
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:16,238
- ls that a question?
- Yeah.

238
00:20:17,816 --> 00:20:19,477
A long time ago, l was.

239
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:21,712
Well, you haven't lost your touch.

240
00:20:21,787 --> 00:20:24,119
Why would l interrogate you, John?

241
00:20:26,024 --> 00:20:29,892
Jack called me a liar in front of
every man, woman and child

242
00:20:29,962 --> 00:20:32,453
l've come to know
over the past month.

243
00:20:32,531 --> 00:20:36,262
There's a part of you that thinks
maybe there isn't a plane here at all.

244
00:20:37,302 --> 00:20:39,668
l know when l'm being lied to.

245
00:20:40,539 --> 00:20:41,733
There's a plane.

246
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:59,322
Like l said,
you haven't lost your touch.

247
00:21:03,362 --> 00:21:05,296
[Sayid] You've lost your edge,
old man.

248
00:21:05,364 --> 00:21:08,094
[Essam] l never had one
when l played you.

249
00:21:08,166 --> 00:21:09,599
Were you always this slow?

250
00:21:09,668 --> 00:21:10,862
Come on, let's play.

251
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:14,565
You have to get out of that apartment.
Practice more.

252
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,972
Haddad would like that.

253
00:21:17,042 --> 00:21:19,101
More blending in
with the community.

254
00:21:19,177 --> 00:21:20,940
He's got his eye on a target.

255
00:21:21,847 --> 00:21:23,246
What makes you say that?

256
00:21:23,315 --> 00:21:26,284
For two weeks, he's been
asking me about explosives.

257
00:21:26,351 --> 00:21:29,115
Blast radius. Transport.

258
00:21:29,187 --> 00:21:30,950
Haddad's very thorough.

259
00:21:31,023 --> 00:21:33,082
Has he gotten hold of any yet?

260
00:21:33,158 --> 00:21:35,820
Explosives? l don't know.

261
00:21:37,162 --> 00:21:40,154
All l know is there's going
to be an operation.

262
00:21:40,832 --> 00:21:43,096
And there is going to be a martyr.

263
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:47,233
You?

264
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:49,968
Haddad told me this morning.

265
00:21:54,646 --> 00:21:57,114
Come on, let's keep playing.

266
00:21:57,182 --> 00:21:59,650
- Essam.
- l'm going to wipe the floor with you.

267
00:21:59,718 --> 00:22:01,345
What is it?

268
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:03,251
What is it?

269
00:22:06,391 --> 00:22:08,882
l don't think l can do it.

270
00:22:10,796 --> 00:22:13,196
- [Cole] You're kidding me, right?
- Listen to me.

271
00:22:13,265 --> 00:22:14,892
l can get Essam to turn himself in.

272
00:22:14,966 --> 00:22:18,493
- Does he know where the C-4 is?
- The other two are the ones you want.

273
00:22:18,570 --> 00:22:21,130
- Essam's confused...
- Does he know where it is?

274
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:24,675
- No.
- Then he's useless.

275
00:22:24,743 --> 00:22:27,473
These cells run top down.
lt's all need-to-know.

276
00:22:27,546 --> 00:22:31,448
The recruit's handed a bomb and a target
at the last possible moment.

277
00:22:31,516 --> 00:22:35,748
The way to find the C-4 is wait for
Essam to walk out with a target to hit.

278
00:22:35,821 --> 00:22:37,948
He's in over his head,
doesn't know why...

279
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:40,992
That's why you convince him
to go through with it.

280
00:22:42,894 --> 00:22:44,293
No.

281
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:46,156
No. l will not.

282
00:22:46,231 --> 00:22:49,291
- Excuse me?
- l'm done. lt's over.

283
00:22:49,368 --> 00:22:51,802
You're not even close
to being done, my friend.

284
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:54,566
- What are you going to do, arrest me?
- No.

285
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:57,539
We'll arrest her.

286
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:02,203
Your girlfriend's an lraqi living abroad
with a record of insurgency.

287
00:23:03,849 --> 00:23:07,580
Wouldn't it be terrible if she
got picked up as an enemy combatant?

288
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:11,889
So, if you want any chance
of ever seeing her again,

289
00:23:11,957 --> 00:23:14,255
go and talk
your good friend Essam

290
00:23:14,326 --> 00:23:16,317
into blowing himself up.

291
00:23:21,166 --> 00:23:23,361
- [baby crying]
- ~ <i>The itsy-bitsy spider</i>

292
00:23:23,435 --> 00:23:26,063
~ <i>Climbed up the spout</i>

293
00:23:26,138 --> 00:23:30,802
~ <i>Down came the rain</i>
<i>and drowned the spider out</i>

294
00:23:30,876 --> 00:23:33,276
- ~ <i>When the...</i>
- Dude, it's ''washed.''

295
00:23:33,345 --> 00:23:35,813
''Washed the spider out.''

296
00:23:35,881 --> 00:23:38,349
Unless there's some
kind of British version.

297
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:39,475
Okay.

298
00:23:41,019 --> 00:23:44,352
~ <i>Down came the rain</i>
<i>and washed the spider...</i>

299
00:23:44,423 --> 00:23:47,756
- Oh, bollocks. Shh. Shush.
- What's the matter, man?

300
00:23:47,826 --> 00:23:50,226
l can't get the bloody thing
to stop crying.

301
00:23:50,295 --> 00:23:51,421
Maybe he's hungry.

302
00:23:51,496 --> 00:23:53,862
No. Claire nursed him five times.

303
00:23:53,932 --> 00:23:56,765
He make any deposits,
you know, diaper-wise?

304
00:23:56,835 --> 00:23:58,598
[crying continues]

305
00:24:02,974 --> 00:24:03,963
All right.

306
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:07,239
Time to break out the big guns.

307
00:24:08,613 --> 00:24:12,447
~ <i>Whoa! I feel good</i>

308
00:24:12,517 --> 00:24:15,247
~ <i>I knew that I would, now</i>

309
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:17,447
~ <i>I feel good</i>

310
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:20,815
~ <i>I knew that I would, now</i>

311
00:24:21,993 --> 00:24:24,791
~ <i>So good</i>
<i>So good</i>

312
00:24:24,863 --> 00:24:27,161
~ <i>I got you</i>
<i>Bom-bom-bom-bom</i>

313
00:24:27,232 --> 00:24:29,097
[screams] Ow!

314
00:24:29,334 --> 00:24:31,029
[crying loudly]

315
00:24:32,871 --> 00:24:34,668
Dude, that's all l got.

316
00:24:42,914 --> 00:24:44,245
Heroin.

317
00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:46,147
Cargo hold is full of it.

318
00:24:46,218 --> 00:24:48,778
[Locke] Best l can figure,
they were smugglers.

319
00:24:52,624 --> 00:24:55,286
The plane was perched
in the canopy?

320
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:56,993
Right up there.

321
00:24:58,230 --> 00:25:01,791
And Boone climbed up by himself,
because of your charley horse.

322
00:25:01,867 --> 00:25:04,165
Yes. That's right.

323
00:25:05,504 --> 00:25:07,062
Why did you lie?

324
00:25:10,976 --> 00:25:12,637
l made a mistake.

325
00:25:16,448 --> 00:25:19,440
l'm going to salvage
what l can of the radio.

326
00:25:19,518 --> 00:25:22,646
[Sayid] lf we leave now, we should
beat the storm back.

327
00:25:30,095 --> 00:25:32,063
Why don't you trust me, Sayid?

328
00:25:35,066 --> 00:25:36,192
For one thing.

329
00:25:37,435 --> 00:25:40,529
You've been carrying a gun
you've told no one about.

330
00:25:43,408 --> 00:25:46,707
We found one of the smugglers
about half a click west of here

331
00:25:46,778 --> 00:25:50,077
dressed as a priest,
Nigerian currency in his pockets.

332
00:25:50,148 --> 00:25:51,672
And this.

333
00:25:58,490 --> 00:26:00,082
Now you're armed and l'm not.

334
00:26:00,158 --> 00:26:02,854
Does that earn me any trust?

335
00:26:02,928 --> 00:26:06,523
You gave this to me
because l caught you concealing it.

336
00:26:06,598 --> 00:26:09,123
- That earns you adaptability.
- [gun clicks]

337
00:26:11,303 --> 00:26:13,464
l'll tell you something
you don't know.

338
00:26:13,538 --> 00:26:15,301
Please do.

339
00:26:16,975 --> 00:26:19,375
A week after the crash,
there was a cave-in.

340
00:26:19,444 --> 00:26:22,208
- Jack was trapped. Remember?
- Of course.

341
00:26:23,048 --> 00:26:24,310
You, Kate and Sawyer

342
00:26:24,382 --> 00:26:27,476
went out into the jungle
to triangulate a signal.

343
00:26:28,353 --> 00:26:29,513
Yes.

344
00:26:29,588 --> 00:26:31,954
You were hit,
knocked unconscious.

345
00:26:32,023 --> 00:26:35,550
When you woke up, the transceiver,
your equipment was destroyed.

346
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,467
That was me.

347
00:26:52,677 --> 00:26:55,202
This is one time you better
not be telling the truth.

348
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:59,148
- lt was in everyone's interest.
- Ruined my chance to find the source...

349
00:26:59,217 --> 00:27:03,051
Of a distress call saying,
''They're dead. lt killed 'em all.''

350
00:27:03,121 --> 00:27:06,488
ls that a place you really want
to lead people to?

351
00:27:09,194 --> 00:27:12,630
Why wait all this time?
Why not tell me then?

352
00:27:12,697 --> 00:27:16,428
Because back then you wouldn't have
engaged in a reasonable debate.

353
00:27:16,501 --> 00:27:19,698
Nobody else would. You were
so focused to get off the island

354
00:27:19,771 --> 00:27:24,504
you weren't seeing things clearly,
like what's happening with the raft.

355
00:27:24,576 --> 00:27:28,478
- Did you burn the raft?
- No, Sayid, l didn't.

356
00:27:32,183 --> 00:27:34,378
What is the hatch?

357
00:27:35,654 --> 00:27:36,678
The hatch?

358
00:27:36,755 --> 00:27:39,315
Boone mentioned it
before he died.

359
00:27:41,092 --> 00:27:42,286
The hatch?

360
00:27:46,898 --> 00:27:52,461
Two hatches on a plane.
Could be forward... or aft.

361
00:28:01,046 --> 00:28:03,480
[Essam] l'm not sure if l can do this.

362
00:28:04,249 --> 00:28:07,582
You wouldn't be a martyr if you
didn't have to overcome fear.

363
00:28:07,652 --> 00:28:08,949
l'm not afraid to die.

364
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:12,979
lt's all the innocent lives,
all those people.

365
00:28:13,058 --> 00:28:15,549
The imam preaches peace, Sayid,

366
00:28:15,627 --> 00:28:18,221
that every human life is sacred.

367
00:28:18,296 --> 00:28:22,198
lt's true. lnnocent lives will be lost,
in service of a greater good.

368
00:28:22,267 --> 00:28:24,963
What if l'm doing this
because l'm angry?

369
00:28:26,471 --> 00:28:28,803
What if l'm doing this
because they killed her?

370
00:28:28,873 --> 00:28:30,568
What if you are?

371
00:28:38,183 --> 00:28:41,914
Should we just accept
what happened to Zahraa?

372
00:28:41,986 --> 00:28:45,080
What about others like her?
We just accept their deaths?

373
00:28:45,156 --> 00:28:49,525
Because if we do, it means
ultimately we care nothing about them.

374
00:28:57,235 --> 00:28:58,725
l lost someone too, Essam.

375
00:29:01,072 --> 00:29:03,540
l will never be whole again.

376
00:29:04,309 --> 00:29:07,210
There need to be consequences
for those responsible.

377
00:29:08,747 --> 00:29:12,148
That's my duty.
That is how l will honor her.

378
00:29:16,955 --> 00:29:18,752
Haddad was right.

379
00:29:20,291 --> 00:29:23,317
lt was fate that
brought us back together.

380
00:29:27,565 --> 00:29:29,294
Sayid...

381
00:29:31,369 --> 00:29:33,564
...will you do this with me?

382
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:37,831
l will.

383
00:30:01,332 --> 00:30:03,857
[Sayid] How are you?

384
00:30:07,505 --> 00:30:10,872
- Do you want to take a walk?
- Sure.

385
00:30:13,178 --> 00:30:15,203
- l spoke to Locke.
- What did he say?

386
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:17,748
He took me to the plane.

387
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:20,751
l believe what happened
was an accident.

388
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:22,650
Then why did he lie?

389
00:30:24,022 --> 00:30:26,684
l have no idea.

390
00:30:26,758 --> 00:30:29,386
But l don't believe
he meant to harm Boone.

391
00:30:30,495 --> 00:30:32,019
So that's it?

392
00:30:32,797 --> 00:30:35,960
l know how strong the need
can be to find someone to blame...

393
00:30:36,034 --> 00:30:37,899
You don't get it, do you?

394
00:30:39,037 --> 00:30:42,632
- Shannon.
- Just forget about it, okay?

395
00:30:51,316 --> 00:30:53,307
How much weight can this hold?

396
00:30:54,652 --> 00:30:56,017
l don't know.

397
00:30:56,087 --> 00:30:58,647
A lot. Enough.

398
00:30:59,724 --> 00:31:03,387
- [speaks Korean]
- Yeah. Tighter. Got it.

399
00:31:04,562 --> 00:31:06,689
- What if it tips over?
- lt won't.

400
00:31:06,764 --> 00:31:09,460
That's why we made it this wide.

401
00:31:10,201 --> 00:31:11,964
[Michael] There, that should do it.

402
00:31:12,036 --> 00:31:14,163
Right? Good?

403
00:31:16,207 --> 00:31:17,196
Good.

404
00:31:18,443 --> 00:31:21,537
- [Michael] All right.
- What if a shark attacks?

405
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:25,014
Sharks ain't getting
anywhere near us, man.

406
00:31:27,619 --> 00:31:28,677
What if we die?

407
00:31:34,225 --> 00:31:36,056
We are not gonna die.

408
00:31:38,162 --> 00:31:39,686
- Boone died.
- [baby crying]

409
00:31:41,466 --> 00:31:44,560
Michael, do you know
anything about babies?

410
00:31:44,636 --> 00:31:46,399
l can't get this guy to be quiet.

411
00:31:46,471 --> 00:31:50,168
- Walk with him. He'll calm down.
- l tried that.

412
00:31:50,241 --> 00:31:53,540
- Jin, have you seen Sun?
- Huh?

413
00:31:53,611 --> 00:31:56,239
Sun. l need some help
with this baby.

414
00:31:56,314 --> 00:31:59,442
- No.
- Okay.

415
00:32:01,986 --> 00:32:04,580
Chucky, you wanna
keep that kid quiet?

416
00:32:04,656 --> 00:32:07,716
Baby Huey's
like nails on a chalkboard.

417
00:32:07,959 --> 00:32:11,952
Aww, there you go.
You happy now?

418
00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:13,930
[crying]

419
00:32:16,067 --> 00:32:18,058
l was.

420
00:32:18,136 --> 00:32:21,162
lf you're gonna play nursemaid
at least do the damn job.

421
00:32:21,272 --> 00:32:23,069
Hey.
Hey, say something else.

422
00:32:24,676 --> 00:32:28,544
- Just say something, say anything.
- Okay, fine.

423
00:32:28,613 --> 00:32:32,014
l liked that thing a lot better
inside than l like it outside.

424
00:32:32,183 --> 00:32:33,673
[cooing]

425
00:32:37,755 --> 00:32:38,949
What?

426
00:32:52,003 --> 00:32:53,027
Hey.

427
00:32:53,104 --> 00:32:54,571
[groans]

428
00:33:03,014 --> 00:33:04,641
Brought you something to eat.

429
00:33:04,716 --> 00:33:09,050
- What's in it? Chloroform?
- Soup.

430
00:33:10,288 --> 00:33:11,778
Thanks, but l think l'll...

431
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:19,020
- Who was in here?
- l don't know. What's the matter?

432
00:33:19,097 --> 00:33:21,657
- Was anybody in here?
- No, why are you...?

433
00:33:21,733 --> 00:33:24,930
The key to the gun case.
lt's gone.

434
00:33:25,903 --> 00:33:28,463
- Maybe it fell off this morning.
- lt didn't.

435
00:33:30,375 --> 00:33:31,865
What's going on?

436
00:33:31,943 --> 00:33:34,434
Locke took the key.
He's after the guns.

437
00:33:34,512 --> 00:33:36,673
[Kate] l haven't seen him.
You don't know...

438
00:33:36,748 --> 00:33:38,978
- [Jack] No? Then who was it?
- [Sayid] Jack.

439
00:33:43,421 --> 00:33:45,548
lt wasn't Locke.

440
00:34:04,375 --> 00:34:06,138
- [Haddad] Sayid.
- [tires screech]

441
00:34:08,379 --> 00:34:09,710
Get in.

442
00:34:19,257 --> 00:34:20,246
lt's time.

443
00:34:42,947 --> 00:34:46,474
Stay relaxed and focused.
Drive with the windows down.

444
00:34:46,551 --> 00:34:49,042
The fresh air will keep you alert.

445
00:34:51,622 --> 00:34:53,214
You will need to wear these.

446
00:34:57,095 --> 00:34:58,824
lf you run into any problems...

447

Don't be nervous, brother.
We'll be okay.

454
00:35:40,071 --> 00:35:41,800
l'm working with the ClA.

455
00:35:43,875 --> 00:35:45,240
What?

456
00:35:45,309 --> 00:35:48,335
l'm going to give you ten minutes
to get away before l call them.

457
00:35:49,981 --> 00:35:52,279
- You set me up?
- Essam, just go.

458
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:54,818
- Why would you do this to me?
- You're wasting time.

459
00:35:54,886 --> 00:35:58,287
We were going to do this together.
You said you lost someone.

460
00:36:01,692 --> 00:36:03,125
Her name is Nadia.

461
00:36:03,194 --> 00:36:05,628
We were separated years ago.

462
00:36:07,198 --> 00:36:09,632
They know where l can find her.

463
00:36:11,836 --> 00:36:14,669
You used me to find a woman?

464
00:36:27,985 --> 00:36:30,886
- You talked me into this.
- Essam, don't.

465
00:36:30,955 --> 00:36:33,685
- lt was for the greater good.
- l'm begging you to go.

466
00:36:33,758 --> 00:36:36,886
You said you were my brother.
You're supposed to be my friend!

467
00:36:36,961 --> 00:36:38,826
l am your friend.

468
00:36:38,896 --> 00:36:41,126
A friend who told me
to do this for Zahraa,

469
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:44,657
just so you could find
some woman that you love?

470
00:36:52,743 --> 00:36:57,771
Well, Sayid, l hope
she makes you whole again.

471
00:36:57,848 --> 00:37:00,248

00:37:36,587 --> 00:37:41,456
- Please listen to me.
- He did it. l know it.

479
00:37:41,525 --> 00:37:43,288
You're not thinking rationally.

480

You've never fired a gun before.

481
00:37:52,169 --> 00:37:55,696
- Shannon. You don't want to do this.
- Yes, l do.

482
00:37:55,773 --> 00:37:59,334
lf you do it,
you can never take it back.

483
00:38:04,515 --> 00:38:05,914
Stay back!

484
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:11,481
What did you do to him?

518
00:41:01,225 --> 00:41:04,820
He was a terrorist, so he's
not exactly getting a state funeral.

519
00:41:04,895 --> 00:41:07,125
What happens to his body?

520
00:41:12,069 --> 00:41:15,061
After it's released,
he'll be cremated.

521
00:41:15,139 --> 00:41:17,164
A Muslim man
is supposed to be buried.

522
00:41:17,241 --> 00:41:19,801
Yeah? Well, there's
no one to claim the body.

523
00:41:19,877 --> 00:41:21,174
l'll claim him.

524
00:41:21,245 --> 00:41:23,509
You can't claim him
on a plane in two hours.

525
00:41:23,581 --> 00:41:26,482
Then change my flight to tomorrow.

526
00:41:42,399 --> 00:41:44,390
How's your head?

527
00:41:46,370 --> 00:41:49,862
- lt'll heal.
- Another war wound.

528
00:41:51,976 --> 00:41:54,171
l know what it cost you...

529
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:57,513
...to do what you did.

530
00:41:59,183 --> 00:42:00,241
Thank you.

531
00:42:02,653 --> 00:42:05,053
l did it because l sense

532
00:42:05,122 --> 00:42:07,556
you might be our best hope
of surviving here.

533
00:42:10,294 --> 00:42:12,888
But l don't forgive what you did,

534
00:42:12,963 --> 00:42:14,692
and l certainly don't trust you.

535
00:42:16,667 --> 00:42:20,000
And now, you're going
to take me to the hatch.

536
00:42:21,138 --> 00:42:24,574
- Hatch? l already showed you...
- John.

537
00:42:26,010 --> 00:42:27,409
No more lies.
