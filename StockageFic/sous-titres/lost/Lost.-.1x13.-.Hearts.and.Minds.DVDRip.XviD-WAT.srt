00:00:01,735 --> 00:00:03,225
<i>[narrator] Previously on</i> Lost<i>:</i>

2
00:00:03,436 --> 00:00:04,596
Has anyone seen Ethan?

3
00:00:04,704 --> 00:00:07,138
He went to get some wood,
on the path to the beach.

4
00:00:07,207 --> 00:00:09,038
- Charlie?
- He went after Claire.

5
00:00:09,109 --> 00:00:11,703
Footprints, three distinct sets
all over the place.

6
00:00:11,778 --> 00:00:13,939
Looks like there might
have been a struggle.

7
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:17,313
l think they've been taken.
We need to organize a search party.

8
00:00:17,384 --> 00:00:18,442
Can l help?

9
00:00:18,518 --> 00:00:20,383
Could use a hand,
if you're up for it.

10
00:00:20,453 --> 00:00:23,479
This is a deserted island.
How are you gonna find them?

11
00:00:24,457 --> 00:00:26,687
- What do you do in the real world?
- l was a...

12
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:31,959
...regional collections supervisor
for a box company.

13
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:34,125
Yeah, right.

14
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,168
- You should head back.
- What about you?

15
00:00:36,236 --> 00:00:38,227
- l can take care of myself.
- No.

16
00:00:38,304 --> 00:00:41,330
- l admire your courage, but you...
- l'm not heading back.

17
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:45,601
- Where have you been?
- What do you mean?

18
00:00:45,678 --> 00:00:47,737
You and Locke
leaving before sunrise

19
00:00:47,814 --> 00:00:49,873
and coming back after dark
for four days.

20
00:00:49,949 --> 00:00:51,746
What are you doing out there?

21
00:00:52,952 --> 00:00:55,944
- Looking for Claire.
- l thought there was no trail,

22
00:00:56,022 --> 00:00:57,387
no one knew where to look.

23
00:00:57,457 --> 00:01:00,392
lt's gonna start raining
in one minute.

24
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:02,951
- One minute?
- Give or take a few seconds.

25
00:01:03,029 --> 00:01:04,587
[Shannon] They aren't back yet.

26
00:01:04,664 --> 00:01:06,928
l'm sure they just
made camp for the night.

27
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,096
lf there's anyone on this island
your brother's safe with, it's Locke.

28
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:20,941
They teach you how to predict
the weather at a box company?

29
00:01:43,436 --> 00:01:45,063
l brought you a present

30
00:01:45,138 --> 00:01:47,299
for helping me
with the translations.

31
00:01:48,708 --> 00:01:51,836
l didn't have a chance
to get it gift wrapped, so...

32
00:01:56,149 --> 00:01:57,241
Oh...

33
00:01:57,317 --> 00:02:00,753
l found these in the wreckage,
and l have no use for them personally.

34
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:03,449
They're actually my size.

35
00:02:03,523 --> 00:02:07,653
Well, half a size off, but l swear,
this place is making my feet swell.

36
00:02:07,727 --> 00:02:10,594
Another mysterious force
on the island revealed.

37
00:02:16,002 --> 00:02:17,492
[Hurley] Yo, Boone.

38
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:19,470
- Question for you, dude.
- Yeah.

39
00:02:19,539 --> 00:02:21,973
You and Locke are hunting boar
every day, right?

40
00:02:22,041 --> 00:02:23,770
- What about it?
- lt's cool, except

41
00:02:23,843 --> 00:02:26,175
how come you're not
coming back with any?

42
00:02:26,246 --> 00:02:29,340
We haven't had fresh pork
on our plate in about a week.

43
00:02:29,415 --> 00:02:31,940
lt's not like they're
domesticated animals.

44
00:02:32,018 --> 00:02:34,452
- Maybe you aren't trying hard?
- We're hunting.

45
00:02:34,521 --> 00:02:38,048
l hope so, 'cause
people need food, man.

46
00:02:38,791 --> 00:02:39,951
Solid food.

47
00:02:40,026 --> 00:02:42,517
This isn't a game, man.

48
00:02:42,595 --> 00:02:46,326
[Shannon chattering]

49
00:02:48,334 --> 00:02:50,598
[cell phone ringing]

50
00:02:51,704 --> 00:02:53,865
l can't believe you
ran down that last ball.

51
00:02:53,973 --> 00:02:56,373
- Then you hit it for a winner.
- Lucky shot.

52
00:02:56,442 --> 00:02:58,376
Yeah, l wish it was luck.

53
00:02:58,444 --> 00:03:00,742
- [cell phone ringing]
- ls that my phone?

54
00:03:01,414 --> 00:03:02,972
Yeah, hello.

55
00:03:03,049 --> 00:03:04,482
<i>[Shannon] Boone, it's me.</i>

56
00:03:04,551 --> 00:03:06,883
- Shannon?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

57
00:03:08,721 --> 00:03:10,712
What's the matter?

58
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:13,020
- <i>Things aren't so good.</i>
- Where are you?

59
00:03:13,092 --> 00:03:15,287
<i>Get out of here!</i>
<i>Get the hell away from me!</i>

60
00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:17,022
- Shannon?
- <i>Stay out of here!</i>

61
00:03:17,096 --> 00:03:18,393
<i>Get away from me!</i>

62
00:03:18,464 --> 00:03:20,227
- What's going on?
- <i>I can't talk.</i>

63
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:21,767
All right, hang on.

64
00:03:21,834 --> 00:03:25,031
Just tell me where you are.
l'll come get you.

65
00:03:25,104 --> 00:03:26,901
- <i>Sydney.</i>
- Sydney.

66
00:03:26,973 --> 00:03:28,497
<i>Australia.</i>

67
00:03:35,448 --> 00:03:37,075
Stay away from my sister.

68
00:03:38,618 --> 00:03:41,086
For a moment, you seemed
to be giving me an order.

69
00:03:41,154 --> 00:03:44,146
- lt's just a friendly suggestion.
- A suggestion.

70
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:46,385
Yes, and if l were you, l'd listen.

71
00:03:46,459 --> 00:03:48,620
What if l don't?

72
00:03:50,363 --> 00:03:51,887
[Locke] Boone!

73
00:03:52,932 --> 00:03:55,264
l found some fresh tracks
down by the stream.

74
00:03:58,104 --> 00:04:01,073
- l'll see you later.
- You know where to find me.

75
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:12,248
[Locke] Put aside your differences
with Sayid.

76
00:04:12,318 --> 00:04:13,910
[Boone] He's hitting on Shannon.

77
00:04:15,021 --> 00:04:18,286
[Locke] He's very competent.
We don't want to make an enemy of him.

78
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:20,519
We're gonna want him on our side.

79
00:04:21,694 --> 00:04:24,026
People are talking
about what we're doing,

80
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:26,122
since we never
come back with anything.

81
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:27,894
You mean boar.

82
00:04:27,967 --> 00:04:30,527
- Yeah.
- There's plenty of fruit and fish.

83
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:34,372
What we're doing here
is far more important.

84
00:04:47,654 --> 00:04:51,021
Right now,
this is our priority.

85
00:05:15,581 --> 00:05:17,344
So, Jack...

86
00:05:18,251 --> 00:05:19,775
So, Hurley.

87
00:05:19,852 --> 00:05:22,116
There's something kind of important

88
00:05:22,188 --> 00:05:24,679
l've been wanting to ask you about.

89
00:05:24,757 --> 00:05:26,418
Um...

90
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:30,156
Anything l tell you is, uh,

91
00:05:30,229 --> 00:05:34,256
doctor-patient confidential, right?

92
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:36,097
Yeah.

93
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:40,230
The thing is,
l haven't been feeling so great.

94
00:05:40,306 --> 00:05:42,103
What's the matter?

95
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:45,269
Well, it's kinda like, uh,
my stomach.

96
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:47,973
l've been having some, um...

97
00:05:48,047 --> 00:05:49,981
...major digestive issues.

98
00:05:50,049 --> 00:05:52,540
- What have you been eating?
- The usual<i>:</i>

99
00:05:52,618 --> 00:05:55,678
Bananas, papayas, mangoes,

100
00:05:55,755 --> 00:05:57,052
guava, passion fruit,

101
00:05:57,123 --> 00:06:00,320
coconut, some of those weird
star fruits from up on the hill.

102
00:06:00,393 --> 00:06:02,588
Someone said they'd
be good for digestion.

103
00:06:02,662 --> 00:06:03,993
Let me tell you, they lied.

104
00:06:04,063 --> 00:06:06,327
lt might help if you had
a little more protein.

105
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:09,129
What can l do? There's no boar.
No boar, no protein.

106
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:12,603
You can eat fish.
Jin's been catching a lot of 'em.

107
00:06:12,672 --> 00:06:15,072
- That guy has it in for me.
- Come on...

108
00:06:15,141 --> 00:06:18,338
l'm not kidding.
He offered me something to eat, like,

109
00:06:18,411 --> 00:06:21,141
right after we, you know, got here.

110
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:24,445
- Um, that thing with the spikes.
- Sea urchin.

111
00:06:24,517 --> 00:06:26,485
Yeah, when l turned him down,
it's like

112
00:06:26,552 --> 00:06:30,215
l soiled his
family honor or something.

113
00:06:30,289 --> 00:06:33,747
He hasn't looked me in the eye since.
The guy holds a serious grudge.

114
00:06:33,826 --> 00:06:35,691
You're not eating those, are you?

115
00:06:35,762 --> 00:06:37,593
[stomach gurgling]

116
00:06:37,663 --> 00:06:40,257
Dude, these aren't for eating.

117
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:42,028
Excuse me.

118
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:19,431
- l can see you there, you know.
- [chuckles]

119
00:07:21,374 --> 00:07:22,568
l wasn't hiding.

120
00:07:23,543 --> 00:07:25,977
l just didn't want
to disrupt you from doing...

121
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:29,610
...whatever it is you're doing.

122
00:07:30,917 --> 00:07:35,354
- lt's not like it's a secret.
- Hard to tell with you sometimes.

123
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:42,359
Ah! Gross, little,
grayish yellow things.

124
00:07:42,428 --> 00:07:44,862
- Passion fruit seeds.
- What are they for?

125
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:50,459
l'll show you...
if you want to see.

126
00:07:51,037 --> 00:07:52,299
Yeah.

127
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:55,398
Follow me.

128
00:07:57,210 --> 00:08:00,008
Please tell me
you found a coffee bar.

129
00:08:00,913 --> 00:08:02,380
Not quite.

130
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:11,346
[Jack chuckles]

131
00:08:12,859 --> 00:08:15,453
- When did you do all this?
- l didn't.

132
00:08:15,528 --> 00:08:17,758
lt was all Sun.

133
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:21,493
l wandered into this place the other day
when l was picking fruit.

134
00:08:24,136 --> 00:08:26,627
This is beautiful. lt's great.

135
00:08:26,706 --> 00:08:29,573
She planted some herbs
and some low-growing stuff here,

136
00:08:29,642 --> 00:08:32,736
and then she started
a grove over there.

137
00:08:32,812 --> 00:08:34,575
Smart.

138
00:08:34,647 --> 00:08:38,139
With the boar running out, we're gonna
need as much food as we can get.

139
00:08:38,217 --> 00:08:41,380
- Maybe it's not running out.
- What do you mean?

140
00:08:42,388 --> 00:08:45,323
Maybe Locke's just decided
not to catch it for us anymore.

141
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:48,616
- Why would he do that?
- A lot of mouths to feed.

142
00:08:48,694 --> 00:08:52,528
lf the boar's thinning out, why should
he feed everyone else at his expense?

143
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:59,600
[Boone] That glass isn't breaking,
and the door is sealed shut.

144
00:08:59,672 --> 00:09:01,435
l think it's cement.

145
00:09:03,476 --> 00:09:06,001
- What is that?
- [Locke] Hmm?

146
00:09:06,078 --> 00:09:08,069
The stuff in the bowl,
what is that?

147
00:09:08,147 --> 00:09:09,637
lt's for later.

148
00:09:12,118 --> 00:09:13,551
Not to be too difficult,

149
00:09:13,619 --> 00:09:17,146
but we've been coming here for two days,
just staring at this thing.

150
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:20,659
l'm not really sure what
we're supposed to be doing.

151
00:09:20,726 --> 00:09:22,455
Lodovico Buonarroti.

152
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:26,998
Michelangelo's father,

153
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:28,624
he was a wealthy man.

154
00:09:28,701 --> 00:09:31,898
Had no understanding
of the divinity in his son,

155
00:09:31,971 --> 00:09:33,939
so he beat him.

156
00:09:34,006 --> 00:09:36,566
No child of his was gonna
use his hands for a living.

157
00:09:36,642 --> 00:09:40,169
So Michelangelo learned
not to use his hands.

158
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:44,512
Years later, a visiting prince
came into Michelangelo's studio

159
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:49,886
and found the master staring at
a single 1 8-foot block of marble.

160
00:09:49,956 --> 00:09:53,187
He knew the rumors were true,
Michelangelo had come in every day

161
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:55,625
for the past four months,

162
00:09:55,695 --> 00:09:57,356
stared at the marble

163
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:58,988
and gone home for supper.

164
00:09:59,065 --> 00:10:01,795
So the prince asked the obvious<i>:</i>
''What are you doing?''

165
00:10:01,867 --> 00:10:05,928
And Michelangelo turned around
and looked at him and whispered...

166
00:10:06,005 --> 00:10:07,802
[speaking ltalian]

167
00:10:08,908 --> 00:10:10,307
''l'm working.''

168
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:18,372
Three years later, that block of marble
was the statue of David.

169
00:10:21,887 --> 00:10:25,118
We're not gonna stare at this thing
for four months, are we?

170
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:28,453
How we gonna open it?

171
00:10:28,527 --> 00:10:31,860
That's what we have to figure out.
That's why we're sitting here.

172
00:10:33,432 --> 00:10:35,024
l mean, how do you open a...

173
00:10:36,035 --> 00:10:38,799
...hatch that has no handle,
no latch...

174
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:44,443
...no discernible way
of opening it?

175
00:10:49,515 --> 00:10:51,506
[knocking]

176
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:56,447
Yeah?

177
00:10:57,623 --> 00:10:59,648
- l'm looking for Shannon.
- Who are you?

178
00:10:59,725 --> 00:11:01,215
l'm her brother.

179
00:11:08,367 --> 00:11:10,460
- Boone?
- What's going on?

180
00:11:10,536 --> 00:11:12,003
What are you doing here?

181
00:11:12,605 --> 00:11:16,132
Fifteen hours. l just spent
1 5 hours on a plane.

182
00:11:16,208 --> 00:11:18,733
''l'm happy to see you.''
That might work.

183
00:11:18,811 --> 00:11:21,041
Listen, this isn't really
the best time.

184
00:11:21,113 --> 00:11:24,173
Bryan and l were on our way out
to meet some friends.

185
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:25,808
Give me a call tomorrow.

186
00:11:31,824 --> 00:11:33,985
Please.

187
00:11:36,395 --> 00:11:37,589
Okay.

188
00:11:39,231 --> 00:11:41,358
Enjoy your friends.

189
00:11:51,343 --> 00:11:54,608
[Hurley] Jin! Yo, Jin!

190
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:55,840
Uh, <i>alto.</i>

191
00:11:56,849 --> 00:11:59,682
l know you don't like me
'cause of the sea urchin thing.

192
00:11:59,752 --> 00:12:02,312
That's okay, 'cause l'm not
asking for any favors.

193
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:05,357
Just let me know
where you get the fish.

194
00:12:06,625 --> 00:12:08,024
Fish.

195
00:12:09,095 --> 00:12:10,995
Point me in the right direction.

196
00:12:11,063 --> 00:12:14,931
l'll take care of my own
business with my own tools.

197
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,298
[speaking Korean]

198
00:12:20,806 --> 00:12:22,967
You just said
something mean, didn't you?

199
00:12:28,981 --> 00:12:31,142
You know, we're gonna
have to tell 'em.

200
00:12:31,217 --> 00:12:34,482
- Tell them what?
- What we found.

201
00:12:35,387 --> 00:12:38,117
They're not gonna keep believing
that we're hunting.

202
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:41,455
They're not ready.
They won't understand it.

203
00:12:41,527 --> 00:12:44,553
- l don't think l understand it.
- That's the problem.

204
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:47,463
Look, at least...
l gotta tell Shannon.

205
00:12:47,967 --> 00:12:49,662
- Why?
- 'Cause she's my sister.

206
00:12:49,735 --> 00:12:52,135
Why do you care
about her so much?

207
00:12:52,204 --> 00:12:54,104
You don't know her, man.

208
00:12:54,173 --> 00:12:57,574
She's smart and she's special
in a lot of ways.

209
00:12:58,410 --> 00:12:59,900
Fair enough.

210
00:13:01,714 --> 00:13:05,241
She's been asking me about this.
l can't keep lying to her.

211
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:08,211
You can't keep lying to her,

212
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:10,755
or you can't stand the way
she makes you feel

213
00:13:10,823 --> 00:13:12,984
because you're lying to her?

214
00:13:13,592 --> 00:13:15,389
Both. Whatever.

215
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:18,521
Look, she can keep a secret.

216
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,564
- You're sure?
- Yes, l'm sure.

217
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:25,604
l mean, are you sure
you want to do this?

218
00:13:25,671 --> 00:13:28,936
l gotta get her off my back.
She keeps asking me about this,

219
00:13:29,008 --> 00:13:31,067
about you, about the whole thing.

220
00:13:31,143 --> 00:13:34,271
Are you sure you've thought
through the ramifications?

221
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,211
Yes.

222
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:38,978
So be it.

223
00:14:06,245 --> 00:14:07,542
Locke...

224
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:12,215
What is this?

225
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:17,583
Do you hear me?

226
00:14:18,224 --> 00:14:21,421
- Untie me right now.
- Or what?

227
00:14:22,094 --> 00:14:26,053
l swear l won't tell anyone about
the hatch thing, okay? l promise.

228
00:14:26,131 --> 00:14:30,090
l'm doing this because it's time
for you to let go of some things,

229
00:14:30,169 --> 00:14:31,898
because it's what's best for you.

230
00:14:31,971 --> 00:14:35,600
And l promise, you're gonna
thank me for this later.

231
00:14:37,176 --> 00:14:40,509
Hey, l don't think
this is best for me.

232
00:14:40,579 --> 00:14:41,841
What is that?

233
00:14:41,914 --> 00:14:44,382
An untreated wound out here,

234
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:46,583
it's gonna get infected.

235
00:14:50,656 --> 00:14:52,283
You're not gonna leave me here.

236
00:14:52,358 --> 00:14:54,519
Whether you stay is up to you.

237
00:14:54,593 --> 00:14:56,220
The camp is four miles due west.

238
00:14:56,295 --> 00:14:57,694
Which way is west?

239
00:15:09,275 --> 00:15:12,938
You'll be able to cut yourself free
once you have the proper motivation.

240
00:15:20,119 --> 00:15:21,279
Locke!

241
00:15:38,671 --> 00:15:41,333
[straining]

242
00:15:43,375 --> 00:15:45,138
[shrieks]

243
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:46,404
Help!

244
00:15:46,478 --> 00:15:48,309
Help!

245
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:51,247
l'm sorry, Mr. Carlisle,
but l'm afraid l can't help you.

246
00:15:51,317 --> 00:15:53,547
We'll need a little more to go on.

247
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:56,053
l don't understand this.
l'm reporting a crime.

248
00:15:57,089 --> 00:15:59,455
Look, this is a cycle
with her, okay?

249
00:15:59,525 --> 00:16:01,959
My sister is attracted
to the wrong kind of guy.

250
00:16:02,027 --> 00:16:04,222
lt was his bottle.
l just gave it back to him.

251
00:16:05,431 --> 00:16:07,456
Hey, yo, croc hunter!

252
00:16:07,533 --> 00:16:10,093
How come nobody wants to hear
my side of the story?

253
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:13,837
Now, if that were her mate,
see, then l could help you.

254
00:16:13,906 --> 00:16:16,204
Let's finish taking down
your information.

255
00:16:16,275 --> 00:16:18,038
You were saying she's your sister.

256
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:21,136
Then why is her name Rutherford
and yours Carlisle?

257
00:16:21,213 --> 00:16:22,805
- ls she married?
- She was.

258
00:16:22,881 --> 00:16:26,442
She's not married anymore.
That has nothing to do with this.

259
00:16:27,953 --> 00:16:29,648
Rutherford is her father's name.

260
00:16:29,722 --> 00:16:31,815
Our parents married
when l was 1 0, she was 8.

261
00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:34,620
- She's your stepsister.
- That's right.

262
00:16:34,693 --> 00:16:37,127
No blood relation.

263
00:16:41,633 --> 00:16:44,295
Maybe you've heard
of my mother, Sabrina Carlisle.

264
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:46,861
She owns the largest wedding
business in the U.S.

265
00:16:46,939 --> 00:16:49,669
l'm the C.O.O. of the
wedding clothing subsidiary.

266
00:16:49,742 --> 00:16:52,074
Would you like to buy
my wife's wedding dress?

267
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:54,611
lt cost $2,000 new.
lt's only been worn once.

268
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:57,843
l just want someone to go pay
this guy a visit, that's all.

269
00:16:57,916 --> 00:17:01,215
ln the absence of physical evidence
or a direct complaint from...

270
00:17:02,254 --> 00:17:04,313
- Shannon.
- ...Shannon...

271
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:06,517
We can't barge
into people's apartments.

272
00:17:06,592 --> 00:17:09,925
Sadly, we're the police,
not the dating police.

273
00:17:16,068 --> 00:17:17,660
- Bryan, we need to talk.
- Huh?

274
00:17:17,736 --> 00:17:19,931
l'm not gonna waste
your time or mine.

275
00:17:20,005 --> 00:17:22,405
l want you to break up
with my sister.

276
00:17:22,474 --> 00:17:26,433
- What?
- l want you to end it today. Right now.

277
00:17:26,512 --> 00:17:29,106
- Bugger off, mate.
- You don't understand.

278
00:17:29,181 --> 00:17:31,672
You'll be the third guy
l've paid to leave.

279
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:35,413
Go to her house, pack your stuff
and never have contact with her again.

280
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:39,014
- Understood?
- So you flew over here to bribe me?

281
00:17:39,091 --> 00:17:41,355
l'm going to give you
25,000 U.S. dollars.

282
00:17:43,695 --> 00:17:45,424
- l love her.
- How much?

283
00:17:45,497 --> 00:17:46,691
My love for her?

284
00:17:49,935 --> 00:17:51,766
lt's worth closer to $50,000.

285
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:58,002
Can you believe we've been here
for over three weeks?

286
00:18:00,612 --> 00:18:03,274
l was on my way to Bali.

287
00:18:03,348 --> 00:18:05,282
l travel a lot.

288
00:18:06,118 --> 00:18:08,643
l was looking forward
to exploring the island.

289
00:18:10,322 --> 00:18:12,950
Somehow l ended up
on a flight to LA instead.

290
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:18,956
l guess that falls under the category
''Be careful what you wish for.''

291
00:18:24,736 --> 00:18:25,964
You understood me.

292
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:31,436
You did, didn't you?
You just understood what l said.

293
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:36,639
You speak English?

294
00:18:38,984 --> 00:18:39,973
Please,

295
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:43,279
don't tell anyone.

296
00:19:03,308 --> 00:19:04,297
Damn it!

297
00:19:07,513 --> 00:19:10,175
[speaking Korean]

298
00:19:10,249 --> 00:19:11,580
You know what? Fine.

299
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:14,346
You win, okay? You happy now?

300
00:19:14,419 --> 00:19:17,684
Keep your damn fish.
l'm outta here.

301
00:19:17,756 --> 00:19:20,486
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

302
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:23,153
l stepped on a friggin' urchin!

303
00:19:23,228 --> 00:19:25,093
You understand me?

304
00:19:26,198 --> 00:19:29,929
You understand infection?
Gangrene? Amputation?

305
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:32,800
Ow! My foot!

306
00:19:33,772 --> 00:19:38,209
- [Jin speaks Korean]
- [Hurley groans]

307
00:19:39,411 --> 00:19:42,574
Oh. Ow! Oh, you gotta
do something for me.

308
00:19:42,648 --> 00:19:45,139
[speaking Korean]

309
00:19:45,217 --> 00:19:47,117
You're gonna have
to pee on my foot.

310
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:49,848
lt'll stop the venom.
l saw it on TV.

311
00:19:49,922 --> 00:19:51,549
Just do it! Ow!

312
00:19:51,623 --> 00:19:54,956
No, just pee on it, man!
You need to pee...

313
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:56,892
Pee on it.

314
00:19:56,962 --> 00:19:58,725
Pee on my foot. l'll lose...

315
00:19:58,797 --> 00:20:00,731
l'll lose my foot if you don't.

316
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:04,326
Just pee on it!

317
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:05,694
No!

318
00:20:19,785 --> 00:20:21,412
[rustling]

319
00:20:26,858 --> 00:20:29,019
- Hi.
- l didn't hear you.

320
00:20:29,094 --> 00:20:32,291
Sorry. l'm sneakier
than l give myself credit for.

321
00:20:33,632 --> 00:20:35,930
- What are you doing out here?
- We were hunting.

322
00:20:36,001 --> 00:20:39,164
Boone thought
l should take the afternoon off.

323
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:40,830
Boone is hunting?

324
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:43,340
Boy's eager to learn.

325
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:47,437
- You think he'll catch anything?
- Nope.

326
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:54,018
What are you doing out here, Sayid?

327
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:55,747
Orienteering.

328
00:20:55,821 --> 00:20:58,449
l'm trying to make something
of Rousseau's maps...

329
00:20:58,523 --> 00:20:59,990
There's nothing to make.

330
00:21:01,326 --> 00:21:02,452
Exactly.

331
00:21:02,527 --> 00:21:05,155
Well, you made a compass.
l haven't seen one of those

332
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:08,290
since l was a Webelos.

333
00:21:08,367 --> 00:21:10,130
What's a Webelos?

334
00:21:10,202 --> 00:21:12,363
Hal<i>fw</i>ay between
a Cub Scout and a Boy Scout.

335
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:14,735
And what does a Webelos do?

336
00:21:16,141 --> 00:21:18,541
Gets badges mostly.

337
00:21:19,745 --> 00:21:22,339
Ties knots, identifies birds.

338
00:21:24,249 --> 00:21:26,843
l wasn't the most popular kid.

339
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:36,423
l'll leave you to it.

340
00:21:36,495 --> 00:21:37,621
Here.

341
00:21:38,196 --> 00:21:39,993
Maybe this will help your cause.

342
00:21:44,436 --> 00:21:47,405
- Don't you need this?
- Not anymore.

343
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:06,090
[woman] Somebody, help me!

344
00:22:09,094 --> 00:22:12,063
- Who's that?
- Boone?

345
00:22:13,065 --> 00:22:14,862
Shannon!

346
00:22:14,933 --> 00:22:17,527
- l'm tied up!
- What?

347
00:22:18,437 --> 00:22:19,768
Can you get over here?

348
00:22:19,838 --> 00:22:21,829
l'm tied up too!

349
00:22:21,907 --> 00:22:23,602
[birds' wings fluttering]

350
00:22:23,675 --> 00:22:26,439
[roaring]

351
00:22:26,511 --> 00:22:29,605
[crashing]

352
00:22:29,681 --> 00:22:33,139
- [Shannon screams]
- Hold on. l'm coming!

353
00:22:33,218 --> 00:22:36,449
[Shannon] Boone!
lt's getting closer!

354
00:22:36,521 --> 00:22:38,989
Somebody, help me!

355
00:22:39,057 --> 00:22:41,048
[crashing grows louder]

356
00:22:41,126 --> 00:22:42,753
Boone?

357
00:22:42,828 --> 00:22:44,659
[grunting]

358
00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:48,121
[yelling]

359
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,895
[growling]

360
00:22:51,636 --> 00:22:53,831
Please, Boone!

361
00:22:53,905 --> 00:22:55,532
[yelling]

362
00:22:58,410 --> 00:23:00,674
Oh! [gasping]

363
00:23:00,746 --> 00:23:02,805
- [roaring]
- [crashing]

364
00:23:02,881 --> 00:23:03,905
Boone!

365
00:23:05,617 --> 00:23:08,142
[roaring]

366
00:23:11,223 --> 00:23:13,919
- Boone!
- Shannon!

367
00:23:16,228 --> 00:23:18,594
- Help me! Hurry!
- l'm trying.

368
00:23:18,663 --> 00:23:19,755
Please.

369
00:23:20,465 --> 00:23:22,126
Please hurry!

370
00:23:23,568 --> 00:23:25,035
Go!

371
00:23:28,006 --> 00:23:30,031
- [crashing]
- [roaring]

372
00:23:30,108 --> 00:23:31,541
Come on!

373
00:23:33,145 --> 00:23:35,579
- Run!
- No! ln here.

374
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:41,185
[roaring]

375
00:23:43,655 --> 00:23:45,520
[growling]

376
00:24:02,374 --> 00:24:05,775
[birds screeching]

377
00:24:15,187 --> 00:24:17,178
- [loud crash]
- [Shannon sobbing] No!

378
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:27,530
Let me ask you something.

379
00:24:27,599 --> 00:24:30,124
Which way do you think north is?

380
00:24:30,202 --> 00:24:32,500
- Sorry?
- North. Which way is it?

381
00:24:32,571 --> 00:24:35,165
Uh... [sighs]

382
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:36,901
Okay.

383
00:24:36,975 --> 00:24:38,567
The sun's gonna set there,

384
00:24:38,643 --> 00:24:42,079
so that makes that west.

385
00:24:43,215 --> 00:24:44,978
That'd be north.

386
00:24:45,917 --> 00:24:47,145
Yeah.

387
00:24:47,219 --> 00:24:50,052
Correct.
That's where north should be.

388
00:24:54,826 --> 00:24:56,623
Yet that is north.

389
00:24:58,029 --> 00:24:59,018
l'm not...

390
00:24:59,097 --> 00:25:02,692
A magnetic anomaly might explain
a variance of two or three degrees,

391
00:25:02,767 --> 00:25:04,962
but not this.

392
00:25:05,036 --> 00:25:08,995
- What are you saying?
- This compass is obviously defective.

393
00:25:11,276 --> 00:25:12,641
Where'd you get it?

394
00:25:12,711 --> 00:25:14,508
Locke gave it to me this afternoon.

395
00:25:15,413 --> 00:25:17,040
Locke.

396
00:25:18,383 --> 00:25:20,180
Where'd you see Locke?

397
00:25:20,252 --> 00:25:23,710
About a mile east of here,
walking through the jungle.

398
00:25:24,823 --> 00:25:26,415
At least l think it's east.

399
00:25:33,698 --> 00:25:36,565
[panting]

400
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:11,631
[Shannon] What did you do to him?

401
00:26:11,703 --> 00:26:14,763
- What did l do to who?
- Locke.

402
00:26:14,839 --> 00:26:16,670
What did you do to piss him off?

403
00:26:16,741 --> 00:26:18,641
l didn't do anything to him.

404
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:21,543
What, he just did it
because he was bored?

405
00:26:21,613 --> 00:26:24,673
- Look, l know you guys are...
- Let's go back to camp.

406
00:26:26,384 --> 00:26:28,181
[knocking]

407
00:26:32,057 --> 00:26:34,525
- You were supposed to come later.
- Any bags?

408
00:26:34,593 --> 00:26:36,527
- Anything you want?
- Come back.

409
00:26:36,595 --> 00:26:38,620
No, we're getting out
of this country.

410
00:26:39,197 --> 00:26:41,859
ls there anything you want
to bring with you?

411
00:26:41,933 --> 00:26:43,127
What's the matter?

412
00:26:47,772 --> 00:26:49,262
Oh, look at this.

413
00:26:49,341 --> 00:26:51,206
Let's go, please.

414
00:26:51,977 --> 00:26:53,444
Come on.

415
00:26:53,511 --> 00:26:55,411
We can go.

416
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:58,278
Hey, mate, you don't
get this yet, do you?

417
00:26:58,350 --> 00:26:59,612
What's what.

418
00:27:10,428 --> 00:27:12,055
You set me up.

419
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:13,597
This whole thing was a setup.

420
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,862
- She's getting what she's owed.
- What did you say?

421
00:27:17,936 --> 00:27:21,167
She told me your mum screwed
Shannon over after her daddy died,

422
00:27:21,239 --> 00:27:23,104
kept her father's money for herself.

423
00:27:23,174 --> 00:27:25,938
Oh, sweet mum you got there.

424
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:29,340
This isn't the first time, is it?

425
00:27:31,416 --> 00:27:34,351
- You've done this before, little bitch.
- That's enough.

426
00:27:34,419 --> 00:27:36,512
Don't touch me,
you lowlife piece of...

427
00:27:38,056 --> 00:27:40,024
Bryan, get off of him!

428
00:27:40,992 --> 00:27:43,358
Get off of him! Get off!

429
00:28:12,757 --> 00:28:14,088
Any ships?

430
00:28:14,993 --> 00:28:16,051
Not yet.

431
00:28:16,127 --> 00:28:18,595
But l'm... patient.

432
00:28:19,597 --> 00:28:21,258
Mind if l join you?

433
00:28:25,637 --> 00:28:27,730
Been a while since
you and l talked, John.

434
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:31,504
- Well, you're a busy man.
- So are you.

435
00:28:37,148 --> 00:28:38,945
Where's Boone?

436
00:28:39,017 --> 00:28:42,009
- l haven't seen him today.
- Yeah?

437
00:28:42,087 --> 00:28:44,851
You two have been attached
at the hip all week.

438
00:28:44,923 --> 00:28:48,359
Well, let me just check my hip.
Nope, no Boone.

439
00:28:51,463 --> 00:28:53,658
How's the boar hunting going?

440
00:28:54,466 --> 00:28:56,957
- Between you and me?
- Always.

441
00:28:57,669 --> 00:29:01,070
l'm afraid they're beginning
to migrate outside our valley.

442
00:29:01,139 --> 00:29:04,472
They're smart animals,
and smart animals adapt quickly

443
00:29:04,542 --> 00:29:07,534
when a new predator's
introduced into their environment.

444
00:29:07,612 --> 00:29:09,102
You mean us?

445
00:29:09,948 --> 00:29:12,416
The most dangerous predator of all.

446
00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:21,181
Does anybody else know?

447
00:29:21,259 --> 00:29:22,487
Only Michael.

448
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:24,152
- Not your husband?
- Please...

449
00:29:24,229 --> 00:29:27,528
Don't worry. l can keep a secret.

450
00:29:30,401 --> 00:29:33,768
l took English lessons in Korea.

451
00:29:33,838 --> 00:29:36,306
He doesn't know. lt's...

452
00:29:36,374 --> 00:29:37,534
...complicated.

453
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:39,702
- So why don't you tell him now?
- l can't.

454
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:40,767
Why?

455
00:29:43,014 --> 00:29:44,982
Because l love him.

456
00:29:46,217 --> 00:29:48,515
- l don't...
- Have you never lied

457
00:29:48,586 --> 00:29:50,144
to a man you've loved?

458
00:29:58,163 --> 00:30:00,393
You sure you don't speak English?

459
00:30:00,465 --> 00:30:02,592
'Cause there's a rumor that you do.

460
00:30:05,503 --> 00:30:07,027
Your wife's hot.

461
00:30:18,082 --> 00:30:20,778
[speaking Korean]

462
00:30:20,852 --> 00:30:23,013
Oh, l get it.
This is some kind of payback

463
00:30:23,087 --> 00:30:26,147
because l wouldn't eat
the urchin the other time?

464
00:30:26,224 --> 00:30:28,124
l eat this, you give me a fish, right?

465
00:30:31,129 --> 00:30:33,097
Okay, fine.

466
00:30:36,067 --> 00:30:37,591
Over the lips, past the gums,

467
00:30:37,669 --> 00:30:39,193
yadda, yadda...

468
00:30:39,604 --> 00:30:41,128
Oh, God.

469
00:30:55,353 --> 00:30:57,412
[retching]

470
00:31:05,630 --> 00:31:06,892
Cheers.

471
00:31:09,534 --> 00:31:10,899
You need a hand?

472
00:31:12,003 --> 00:31:14,631
Yeah. l'd love one.

473
00:31:18,243 --> 00:31:20,438
l seen you around the caves lately.

474
00:31:21,646 --> 00:31:23,238
l needed a change of scenery.

475
00:31:24,249 --> 00:31:26,080
How are you doing, Charlie?

476
00:31:26,150 --> 00:31:27,549
How am l doing?

477
00:31:27,619 --> 00:31:29,450
With week two
of heroin withdrawal,

478
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:32,853
or with Claire being abducted
by the freak who tried to kill me?

479
00:31:33,858 --> 00:31:35,917
l gave you the aspirin
for the withdrawal.

480
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:45,396
- What do you think his story is?
- Who?

481
00:31:45,470 --> 00:31:46,630
Locke?

482
00:31:47,538 --> 00:31:49,438
The guy's a freak of nature.

483
00:31:49,507 --> 00:31:50,838
Highly disturbed.

484
00:31:50,909 --> 00:31:52,877
He probably killed all his mates

485
00:31:52,944 --> 00:31:55,469
the day his mom forgot to put
a cookie in his lunch.

486
00:31:55,546 --> 00:31:57,844
That was my first
impression, anyway.

487
00:31:58,983 --> 00:32:01,952
And then he saved my life.

488
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:03,146
So you trust him?

489
00:32:04,622 --> 00:32:06,522
Trust him?

490
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:08,957
lf there's one person
on this island

491
00:32:09,027 --> 00:32:11,996
l would put my absolute faith in
to save us all,

492
00:32:12,063 --> 00:32:13,724
it would be John Locke.

493
00:32:29,614 --> 00:32:31,241
[dog barking]

494
00:32:31,316 --> 00:32:33,682
Come on, boy.
You want the ball?

495
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:38,813
Go get the ball.
Good boy.

496
00:32:38,890 --> 00:32:40,255
[Hurley] You found your bag?

497
00:32:40,325 --> 00:32:41,952
- That's awesome, man.
- Yeah.

498
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:45,388
Be nice to get to use
your own toothbrush again.

499
00:32:46,097 --> 00:32:48,258
- Got some papaya there?
- Yeah.

500
00:32:48,333 --> 00:32:50,563
- Yippee.
- Hey, you mind if l, uh...

501
00:32:50,635 --> 00:32:52,660
Oh, knock yourself out.

502
00:32:52,737 --> 00:32:54,762
Want to wish something
on your enemy?

503
00:32:54,839 --> 00:32:57,171
Hope they step on a sea urchin.

504
00:32:58,843 --> 00:33:00,936
Oh, hey.

505
00:33:08,653 --> 00:33:10,211
Thanks.

506
00:33:12,957 --> 00:33:15,425
Has this already been cleaned?
Are you kidding?

507
00:33:16,494 --> 00:33:20,555
[speaking Korean]

508
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:23,865
[Sun chuckles]

509
00:33:25,136 --> 00:33:29,664
[conversing in Korean]

510
00:33:36,214 --> 00:33:38,444
They look happy.

511
00:33:38,516 --> 00:33:39,505
Happy?

512
00:33:43,888 --> 00:33:45,150
Put out your hand.

513
00:33:48,359 --> 00:33:49,826
You'll like it, l swear.

514
00:33:55,767 --> 00:33:57,962
Gross, little,
grayish yellow thingies?

515
00:33:58,036 --> 00:34:02,029
No, these are slimy,
little, bluish black things.

516
00:34:03,808 --> 00:34:05,366
Guava seeds.

517
00:34:05,443 --> 00:34:08,003
What's a garden without guava?

518
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:19,115
- Are we going the right direction?
- lf you don't want to follow, don't.

519
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:23,422
l wouldn't have to if you weren't
best friends with that nutcase.

520
00:34:23,494 --> 00:34:26,190
You weren't hunting.
You were doing something else.

521
00:34:26,264 --> 00:34:29,995
- Haven't we been over this?
- You're a horrible liar.

522
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:33,060
- We weren't doing anything.
- Why are you keeping secrets?

523
00:34:33,137 --> 00:34:34,604
Do you know who ''this guy'' is?

524
00:34:35,039 --> 00:34:37,872
He's the only one here that has
a clue to what's going on.

525
00:34:37,942 --> 00:34:41,139
- What is that supposed to mean?
- lt means he's smart.

526
00:34:43,381 --> 00:34:45,372
He tied us up, Boone.

527
00:34:46,951 --> 00:34:47,940
Why?

528
00:34:51,856 --> 00:34:53,721
We found something.

529
00:34:54,826 --> 00:34:55,815
What?

530
00:34:56,928 --> 00:35:00,694
While looking for Claire, we found
a piece of metal buried in the jungle.

531
00:35:00,765 --> 00:35:03,495
We've been excavating.
That's what we've been doing.

532
00:35:05,069 --> 00:35:08,505
- A piece of metal.
- A hatch buried in the dirt.

533
00:35:09,173 --> 00:35:12,165
- Like a door?
- Yeah, that's what a hatch is.

534
00:35:13,144 --> 00:35:16,113
- Where does it go?
- [birds' wings fluttering]

535
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:19,549
l don't know.

536
00:35:19,617 --> 00:35:22,484
l told him l wanted to tell you.
That's when he did this.

537
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:27,354
[roaring]

538
00:35:28,559 --> 00:35:29,787
[Boone] Come on!

539
00:35:37,301 --> 00:35:39,769
[roaring continues]

540
00:35:39,837 --> 00:35:41,668
[crashing]

541
00:35:43,875 --> 00:35:48,369
- [loud screeching]
- [Shannon screams]

542
00:35:48,446 --> 00:35:51,108
No! Shannon!

543
00:35:55,686 --> 00:35:57,278
Shannon!

544
00:35:58,055 --> 00:35:59,386
Shannon!

545
00:36:01,559 --> 00:36:02,787
[knocking]

546
00:36:05,763 --> 00:36:07,321
[knocking]

547
00:36:13,104 --> 00:36:14,128
What do you want?

548
00:36:20,211 --> 00:36:22,236
Bryan took the money.

549
00:36:23,481 --> 00:36:25,176
He's gone.

550
00:36:30,721 --> 00:36:34,452
So the player got played.
That's poetic, don't you think?

551
00:36:34,525 --> 00:36:36,755
l knew you'd bring the money.

552
00:36:36,827 --> 00:36:39,022
- You are drunk.
- Do you wanna know why?

553
00:36:39,096 --> 00:36:41,326
lt doesn't matter.
You're going to tell me.

554
00:36:41,399 --> 00:36:43,196
Because you're in love with me.

555
00:36:43,901 --> 00:36:45,425
What?

556
00:36:45,503 --> 00:36:48,199
You brought the money
because you're in love with me.

557
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:51,766
You show up here plastered...

558
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:55,202
- You've always been.
- You've always been self-centered,

559
00:36:55,279 --> 00:36:57,509
but now you're delusional.

560
00:36:57,582 --> 00:36:59,209
l've always known it.

561
00:36:59,984 --> 00:37:01,508
You're sick.

562
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:03,819
No...

563
00:37:08,893 --> 00:37:11,691
- [Boone] Stop.
- lt's okay.

564
00:37:11,762 --> 00:37:12,751
Shannon...

565
00:37:19,003 --> 00:37:21,471
lt's okay.

566
00:37:51,569 --> 00:37:53,867
Boone.

567
00:37:53,938 --> 00:37:55,371
What?

568
00:37:57,141 --> 00:37:59,234
When we get back to LA,

569
00:38:00,845 --> 00:38:04,178
you should just
tell your mom that...

570
00:38:04,248 --> 00:38:07,581
...you rescued me again,
just like you always do,

571
00:38:07,652 --> 00:38:09,711
and then we'll just go back.

572
00:38:09,787 --> 00:38:12,984
- To what?
- To what it was.

573
00:38:14,725 --> 00:38:17,694
Like it's all up to you.

574
00:38:18,896 --> 00:38:20,830
Get dressed.

575
00:38:27,571 --> 00:38:29,061
Shannon!

576
00:38:50,561 --> 00:38:51,789
No.

577
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:07,307
Shannon.

578
00:39:08,879 --> 00:39:10,972
Shannon. Shannon.

579
00:39:15,419 --> 00:39:16,909
Shannon?

580
00:39:17,922 --> 00:39:19,514
Oh, Shannon.

581
00:39:51,055 --> 00:39:52,716
lt killed her!

582
00:39:57,228 --> 00:40:01,927
- You made it back.
- That thing killed my sister.

583
00:40:01,999 --> 00:40:04,024
lt's your fault.
You drug her out there.

584
00:40:04,101 --> 00:40:05,864
- Your sister?
- Don't play dumb.

585
00:40:05,936 --> 00:40:08,700
- Calm down.
- She died in my arms.

586
00:40:09,507 --> 00:40:10,940
Why is there no blood on you?

587
00:40:19,717 --> 00:40:21,776
What just happened
to me out there?

588
00:40:21,852 --> 00:40:23,149
l don't know.

589
00:40:25,022 --> 00:40:26,751
l don't know. You tell me.

590
00:40:29,326 --> 00:40:33,228
- But your sister, Shannon...
- [Shannon] l could spend days...

591
00:40:34,331 --> 00:40:37,300
- [Shannon chuckles]
- [Sayid] Sorry to spoil it.

592
00:40:39,036 --> 00:40:43,473
[chattering]

593
00:40:43,541 --> 00:40:45,566
She... She was dead.

594
00:40:46,710 --> 00:40:49,645
- ls that what it made you see?
- What made me see?

595
00:40:53,250 --> 00:40:55,684
That stuff you put on my head.

596
00:40:56,287 --> 00:40:58,414
- You drugged me?
- l gave you an experience

597
00:40:58,489 --> 00:41:01,549
that l believed was vital
to your survival on this island.

598
00:41:01,625 --> 00:41:03,115
lt wasn't real?

599
00:41:03,194 --> 00:41:05,253
lt was only as real as you made it.

600
00:41:08,699 --> 00:41:09,859
l saw her.

601
00:41:12,136 --> 00:41:14,036
l saw her die.

602
00:41:15,739 --> 00:41:17,229
How did you feel

603
00:41:17,308 --> 00:41:19,367
when she died?

604
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:26,078
l felt... l felt...

605
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:28,243
l felt relieved.

606
00:41:31,422 --> 00:41:33,390
l felt relieved.

607
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:37,721
Yes.

608
00:41:42,066 --> 00:41:44,159
Time to let go.

609
00:41:54,211 --> 00:41:56,270
[Shannon laughs]

610
00:42:04,121 --> 00:42:05,179
Follow me.

611
00:42:14,999 --> 00:42:19,163
[Sayid chattering]
