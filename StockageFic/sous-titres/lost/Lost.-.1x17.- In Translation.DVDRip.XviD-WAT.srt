2
00:02:40,593 --> 00:02:42,220
There they go again.

3
00:02:42,795 --> 00:02:46,492
- You think we should do something?
- [Charlie] What should we do?

4
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,332
What's going on?

5
00:02:49,402 --> 00:02:52,701
l don't know. He walked up
and started going off on her again.

6
00:02:53,573 --> 00:02:54,904
Hey.

7
00:02:57,076 --> 00:02:59,067
Hey, hey, hey! Jin!

8
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:01,006
Get your hands off her!

9
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:04,813
l swear to God, you put your
hands on her one more time...

10
00:03:06,419 --> 00:03:08,182
Get your hands off me!

11
00:04:26,366 --> 00:04:28,926
- [knocking]
- [door opening]

12
00:06:38,731 --> 00:06:40,460
Michael?

13
00:06:43,936 --> 00:06:45,062
l'm sorry.

14
00:06:48,474 --> 00:06:50,066
Don't worry.

15
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:53,836
l stuck my nose
where it didn't belong.

16
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:55,244
lt's on me.

17
00:06:55,314 --> 00:06:56,872
You must understand.

18
00:06:56,949 --> 00:06:58,576
l got to get this raft finished

19
00:06:58,651 --> 00:07:00,551
so l can get my boy
and take him home.

20
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:03,589
When l slapped you,
l was protecting you.

21
00:07:03,656 --> 00:07:05,590
- Yeah? From what?
- From Jin.

22
00:07:06,859 --> 00:07:09,453
You don't know
what he's capable of.

23
00:07:11,397 --> 00:07:14,423
lt's not my problem. lt's yours.

24

25
00:07:35,321 --> 00:07:37,619
Why don't you try sea urchin?

26
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:39,783
They got more ping.

27
00:07:39,859 --> 00:07:41,190
Hey.

28
00:07:46,766 --> 00:07:50,964
l know things got kind of nasty
down there at the beach.

29
00:07:51,037 --> 00:07:54,666
l don't want to get involved
in husband and wife stuff,

30
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:57,072
but l figured, you know,

31
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:59,338
you might need to relax.

32
00:07:59,846 --> 00:08:01,370
So...

33
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:10,721
Come on, dude, l'm trying here.

34
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:13,190
- [grunts]
- OK.

35
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:18,661
You want to be an outsider?
lt's your business.

36
00:08:26,372 --> 00:08:28,738
[Shannon] l tied this side down.

37
00:08:29,308 --> 00:08:31,640
Do you think
this is gonna hold?

38
00:08:31,711 --> 00:08:35,841
Do you have a past in the Navy
you've neglected to tell me about?

39
00:08:35,915 --> 00:08:38,076
- Why?
- How does a woman like you

40
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:40,175
learn how to tie
a perfect bowline knot?

41
00:08:40,253 --> 00:08:42,483
By dating guys with sailboats.

42
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:49,085
Since you bring it up, l've been
worried since l first met you

43
00:08:49,161 --> 00:08:50,822
that you might end up a spinster.

44
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:55,126
Spending my Saturday nights
alone at home tying knots?

45
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:56,998
Perhaps with an overweight aunt.

46
00:08:58,538 --> 00:08:59,903
lt's a very sad image.

47
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:06,109
Maybe we should get some rope,
spend a Saturday night alone together,

48
00:09:06,178 --> 00:09:07,907
and see what happens.

49
00:09:15,855 --> 00:09:17,152
Dad?

50
00:09:18,658 --> 00:09:19,989
Thanks.

51
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:25,353
You are gonna love New York, Walt.
No city like it.

52
00:09:25,431 --> 00:09:27,023
What l really want to show you

53
00:09:27,099 --> 00:09:29,761
- are the buildings, architecture.
- Buildings?

54
00:09:29,835 --> 00:09:32,201
l said that,
'til l saw the Flatiron Building.

55
00:09:32,271 --> 00:09:34,967
- What's that?
- Oldest skyscraper in the city.

56
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:36,269
Built in 1 902.

57
00:09:36,342 --> 00:09:39,106
And it's flat.
That one building inspired me

58
00:09:39,178 --> 00:09:41,169
to start drawing
and designing things.

59
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:43,408
- Why?
- You just gotta see it.

60
00:09:43,482 --> 00:09:46,110
- You want to see it, right?
- l guess.

61
00:09:46,185 --> 00:09:48,551
Can l go throw the ball to Vincent?

62
00:09:49,956 --> 00:09:51,981
Yeah. Sure. Of course.

63
00:09:53,726 --> 00:09:56,661
- Come on, Vincent!
- [barking]

64
00:09:57,763 --> 00:09:59,822
[Jack] Wow, you're making
a lot of progress.

65
00:09:59,899 --> 00:10:02,129
- Yeah, trying.
- lt's pretty cool.

66
00:10:02,868 --> 00:10:05,302
Got this bamboo for the decking,

67
00:10:05,371 --> 00:10:09,000
got a piece of the fuselage
for a cabin.

68
00:10:09,742 --> 00:10:11,937
Some storage bins.

69
00:10:12,878 --> 00:10:14,812
What's up?

70
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,041
l thought l'd give you the heads-up.

71
00:10:17,116 --> 00:10:18,344
Yeah?

72
00:10:18,417 --> 00:10:21,944
There's a lot of talk going on about
who's going on this thing with you.

73
00:10:22,822 --> 00:10:25,620
Hey, man,
it's not the <i>Queen Mary.</i>

74
00:10:25,691 --> 00:10:29,218
l only got room for four people.

75
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:30,728
There's one open spot.

76
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:32,661
Who took the other one?

77
00:10:32,732 --> 00:10:34,791
What's the matter, doc?

78
00:10:34,867 --> 00:10:36,835
Feeling left out?

79
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:39,638
- You're taking Sawyer with you?
- Yep.

80
00:10:39,705 --> 00:10:42,674
Bought myself a ticket
on this little tub.

81
00:10:42,742 --> 00:10:46,109
Let me tell you,
the fare was steep.

82
00:10:46,178 --> 00:10:49,841
Could have used that cable
to hold up my new beach house.

83
00:10:49,915 --> 00:10:51,610
You sold him a spot?

84
00:10:51,684 --> 00:10:54,152
l needed halyards for the mast.

85
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:57,986
Good thing l'm a saver,
not a spender, huh, Doc?

86
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:08,156
How much longer are you gonna
let him treat you this way?

87
00:11:08,934 --> 00:11:10,367
- Please...
- Sun.

88
00:11:12,038 --> 00:11:13,266
He's my husband.

89
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:16,206
A husband you're afraid to tell
you speak English.

90
00:11:17,276 --> 00:11:19,608
l'm trying to understand, Sun.

91
00:11:20,546 --> 00:11:23,208
He wasn't always like this.

92
00:11:25,618 --> 00:11:28,815
He used to tell me
how beautiful l looked to him.

93
00:11:30,756 --> 00:11:32,656
He was so tender.

94
00:11:37,163 --> 00:11:39,529
And then he was different.

95
00:11:40,599 --> 00:11:42,567
What changed him?

96
00:11:45,071 --> 00:11:48,234
- [man] Need some help!
- [people yelling]

97
00:11:51,844 --> 00:11:54,039
Hey, Charlie, what's going on?

98
00:11:54,113 --> 00:11:56,343
The raft, it's on fire. Look.

99
00:12:15,301 --> 00:12:17,701
No! No!

100
00:12:19,672 --> 00:12:21,640
No!

101
00:12:29,682 --> 00:12:30,774
Where is he?

102
00:12:31,684 --> 00:12:33,276
Where the hell is he?

103
00:12:38,157 --> 00:12:39,419
Where is he?

104
00:12:39,492 --> 00:12:41,517
[speaking Korean]

105
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:43,528
- Where is he?
- She doesn't understand.

106
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:46,565
- Hey! Where is he?
- Back off.

107
00:12:46,632 --> 00:12:48,327
Her husband did this.
She knows!

108
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,027
You trying to protect him now?

109
00:12:50,102 --> 00:12:52,093
- She was with me!
- No, Walt!

110
00:12:52,171 --> 00:12:54,230
Get back.

111
00:12:54,306 --> 00:12:56,103
- No, it's done.
- Sun, wait!

112
00:12:56,175 --> 00:12:57,938
l'm gonna break his damn neck!

113
00:12:58,010 --> 00:13:01,537
- Just take it easy, man.
- We don't know that Jin did this.

114
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:03,878
- Are you serious?
- Sawyer, shut up!

115
00:13:03,949 --> 00:13:07,316
- We saw him on the beach.
- That doesn't mean he torched the raft.

116
00:13:07,386 --> 00:13:08,785
Yeah, then who did, Jack?

What do you want?

121
00:16:30,456 --> 00:16:32,720
l'd like to talk to you
about Shannon.

122
00:16:36,028 --> 00:16:37,893
lt's very possible your sister and l

123
00:16:37,963 --> 00:16:40,488
are going to become
more than just friends.

124
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:43,696
What is this,

125
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:46,663
some Middle Eastern thing?

126
00:16:46,739 --> 00:16:49,230
You want my blessing
or something?

127
00:16:50,409 --> 00:16:53,401
- My hope is you won't object.
- Yeah?

128
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:01,877
l was extending a courtesy,
not asking your permission.

129
00:17:02,454 --> 00:17:04,615
Let me tell you about my sister.

130
00:17:06,892 --> 00:17:09,759
She likes older men,
guys who can take care of her.

131
00:17:10,796 --> 00:17:13,731
My guess is in this place
you fit the bill.

132
00:17:15,134 --> 00:17:19,036
She'll make you feel like the greatest
while you get her whatever she needs,

133
00:17:19,104 --> 00:17:22,596
and once she gets what
she wants, she'll move on.

134
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:25,934
When she does,

135
00:17:27,613 --> 00:17:29,843
don't take it personally, man.

Hey, there you are.

140
00:18:14,726 --> 00:18:17,695
Come help me with this.
l'm completely destroying it.

141
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:24,698
- You seem to be doing just fine.
- Yeah, fine at making it collapse.

142
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:27,238
You're very capable, Shannon.

143
00:18:27,306 --> 00:18:30,002
l'm sure you'd be all right
building it on your own.

144
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:35,746
What's going on?

145
00:18:38,484 --> 00:18:42,045
Perhaps you should find
another friend

146
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:44,749
to help you with your shelter.

147
00:18:49,261 --> 00:18:52,628
You've been talking to my brother,
haven't you?

148
00:19:01,273 --> 00:19:03,264
Oh, gross!

149
00:19:03,775 --> 00:19:06,175
Gross to you, dinner to me.

150
00:19:06,678 --> 00:19:08,612
Boone, where is he?

151
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:11,080
- Don't know.
- What do you mean you don't know?

152
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:14,586
- You two are like jungle pals.
- Sorry. l haven't seen him.

153
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:17,588
Well, if you do see him,
tell him to keep his mouth shut.

154
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:20,056
lf he has something to say,
leave Sayid out of it

155
00:19:20,125 --> 00:19:22,787
- and say it to my face.
- Should l be writing this down?

156
00:19:22,861 --> 00:19:26,490
Just tell him to stay
the hell out of my business.

157
00:19:26,565 --> 00:19:28,055
Do you like him?

158
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:32,398
- What?
- Sayid.

159
00:19:34,706 --> 00:19:36,230
Are you serious?

160
00:19:37,409 --> 00:19:40,742
Because if you do like him,

161
00:19:40,812 --> 00:19:43,007
what's it got to do
with your brother?

162
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:46,178
You're a grown woman.

163
00:19:46,251 --> 00:19:48,651
You can yell at Boone
'til you're blue in the face,

164
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,881
all you're doing
is giving him what he wants.

165
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:55,152
- Yeah, what's that?
- Your attention.

166

Everyone gets a new life
on this island, Shannon.

167
00:20:04,469 --> 00:20:07,199
Maybe it's time you start yours.

168
00:20:15,681 --> 00:20:17,444
You must be pretty scared, huh?

169
00:20:17,516 --> 00:20:21,145
Scared. You understand
scared, don't you? Huh?

170
00:20:23,655 --> 00:20:25,350
lf you ain't,

171
00:20:25,424 --> 00:20:27,153

Why'd you burn my raft, man?

Calm down and think

Leave him alone!

206
00:27:59,978 --> 00:28:02,913
He didn't burn your raft.

207
00:28:17,595 --> 00:28:20,655
- You speak English?
- Didn't see that coming.

208
00:28:20,732 --> 00:28:24,224
You understood us all this time?
Why didn't you say anything?

209
00:28:24,302 --> 00:28:27,863
Your raft was already on fire
when he arrived.

210
00:28:27,939 --> 00:28:30,737
He burned his hands
trying to put it out.

211
00:28:30,809 --> 00:28:32,504
Then why did he run?

212
00:28:37,182 --> 00:28:40,674
[speaking Korean]

213
00:28:44,556 --> 00:28:46,751
Exactly. That's what l thought.

214
00:28:46,825 --> 00:28:51,057
My husband is many things,
but he is not a liar.

215
00:28:51,129 --> 00:28:53,893
You're gonna lecture us
about lying, Betty?

216
00:28:53,965 --> 00:28:55,523
From the look on his face,

217
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:58,694
even your old man here
didn't know you speak English.

218
00:28:58,770 --> 00:29:02,206
- How do we know she's not covering?
- Because she isn't!

219
00:29:05,009 --> 00:29:07,807
- Why would he burn the raft?
- He's been after me!

220
00:29:07,879 --> 00:29:10,347
- Everybody knows it!
- OK, it's personal.

221
00:29:10,415 --> 00:29:13,407
Why take it out on our best chance
at getting off the island?

222
00:29:15,053 --> 00:29:17,715
Why would any one of us
block an attempt to get home?

223
00:29:18,656 --> 00:29:21,489
We're so intent on pointing
the finger at one another

224
00:29:21,559 --> 00:29:24,687
that we're ignoring
the simple undeniable truth

225
00:29:24,763 --> 00:29:27,596
that the problem isn't here,
it's there!

226
00:29:27,665 --> 00:29:29,394
They've attacked us!

227
00:29:29,467 --> 00:29:32,664
Sabotaged us,
abducted us, murdered us.

228
00:29:33,738 --> 00:29:37,333
Maybe it's time we stop blaming us
and started worrying about them!

229
00:29:41,312 --> 00:29:43,507
We're not the only people
on this island,

230
00:29:43,581 --> 00:29:45,549
and we all know it!

231
00:29:52,757 --> 00:29:55,749

244
00:31:29,854 --> 00:31:31,685
That's just life.

245
00:31:32,523 --> 00:31:34,218
We'll start over, all right?

246
00:31:35,159 --> 00:31:36,820
You're gonna build another one?

247
00:31:36,895 --> 00:31:40,023
Yeah. A better one.

248
00:31:41,032 --> 00:31:42,727
Can l help?

249
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:44,700
No doubt you can help.

l was going to get away.

254
00:32:43,528 --> 00:32:46,554
But you made me change my mind.

255

that you still loved me.

257
00:37:32,917 --> 00:37:35,317

Got yourself an opponent?

261
00:38:08,319 --> 00:38:10,685
Hurley owes me $83,000.

262
00:38:11,322 --> 00:38:14,189
l told him l'd give him
a chance to win it back.

263
00:38:18,029 --> 00:38:20,259
lt's been a while
since you and l played.

264
00:38:21,432 --> 00:38:25,334
- l don't have $83,000.
- That's OK.

265
00:38:28,039 --> 00:38:30,667
- Where's your pop?
- Down at the beach, l think.

266
00:38:30,741 --> 00:38:33,972
l'm not allowed to leave
the caves after dark.

267

Do you have a dad?

Don't worry.
l'm not gonna tell.

277
00:39:22,793 --> 00:39:25,023
You must have had
a really good reason.
