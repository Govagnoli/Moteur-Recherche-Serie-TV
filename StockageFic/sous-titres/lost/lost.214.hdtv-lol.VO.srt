1
00:00:00,138 --> 00:00:01,288
Previously on "Lost"...

2
00:00:01,459 --> 00:00:03,073
It was them. The Others...

3
00:00:03,166 --> 00:00:05,035
Have you seen other
people on this island?

4
00:00:05,065 --> 00:00:08,352
I hear them.
Out there, in the jungle.

5
00:00:08,445 --> 00:00:09,821
They whisper.

6
00:00:16,231 --> 00:00:19,853
They've attacked us,
sabotaged us, abducted us!

7
00:00:19,945 --> 00:00:23,901
We're not the only people on
this island, and we all know it!

8
00:00:24,087 --> 00:00:27,150
Maybe it's time we stopped blaming
us and started worrying about them!

9
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:29,798
They came the first night,
took three of us,

10
00:00:29,890 --> 00:00:33,369
then they came back
and took nine more.

11
00:00:33,641 --> 00:00:36,244
They're smart,
and they're animals,

12
00:00:36,346 --> 00:00:38,679
and they could be
anywhere at anytime,

13
00:00:38,819 --> 00:00:43,965
and if you think that one gun and
one bullet is gonna stop them...

14
00:00:44,616 --> 00:00:45,992
think again.

15
00:00:49,416 --> 00:00:50,496
Shannon!

16
00:00:58,776 --> 00:01:00,630
This is not your island.

17
00:01:01,283 --> 00:01:03,185
This is our island,

18
00:01:03,652 --> 00:01:06,078
and the only reason
you're livin' on it

19
00:01:06,358 --> 00:01:08,738
is 'cause we let
you live on it.

20
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:15,828
They're getting closer!
Move it!

21
00:01:20,131 --> 00:01:21,269
Burn those!

22
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:23,116
Shred faster!

23
00:01:23,676 --> 00:01:24,956
Hurry up!

24
00:01:25,749 --> 00:01:28,033
Sayid! Take these files!

25
00:01:28,593 --> 00:01:29,539
Burn them!

26
00:01:33,749 --> 00:01:35,603
Keep shredding you cowards!

27
00:01:35,882 --> 00:01:37,353
We leave when I say!

28
00:01:40,535 --> 00:01:43,391
Stop again,
and I'll kill you myself!

29
00:01:46,058 --> 00:01:48,818
I'm your commanding,
officer, and you will do--

30
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,101
Stop! Get down!
Get the hell down!

31
00:01:51,131 --> 00:01:52,081
Get down, get down!

32
00:01:52,167 --> 00:01:54,737
You, no, no, no,
drop your gun on the ground now!

33
00:01:54,877 --> 00:01:56,349
Freeze! On the ground now!

34
00:01:56,469 --> 00:01:59,040
Stop burning that stuff!
Get the hell down!

35
00:01:59,161 --> 00:02:00,489
Who's in charge here?

36
00:02:03,763 --> 00:02:05,713
I said who's in charge?!

37
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:10,912
Somebody better tell him to stop,
or god help me, he's dead!

38
00:02:11,051 --> 00:02:12,374
They don't
understand, sergeant.

39
00:02:12,404 --> 00:02:14,448
They understand. Listen up!

40
00:02:14,587 --> 00:02:17,205
I'll fire on three! One, two...

41
00:02:17,326 --> 00:02:20,088
Stop shredding or
they'll kill you!

42
00:02:23,456 --> 00:02:24,115
You!

43
00:02:25,846 --> 00:02:27,173
You in charge?

44
00:02:27,546 --> 00:02:30,019
- No, I am not.
- Who is?

45
00:02:34,135 --> 00:02:36,515
There is no commanding
officer here.

46
00:02:36,654 --> 00:02:39,731
He left two hours
ago for Hillah.

47
00:02:39,916 --> 00:02:42,105
Your English is good, Abdul,

48
00:02:42,198 --> 00:02:43,956
but you're lying,

49
00:02:44,124 --> 00:02:45,356
and that ain't so good.

50
00:02:59,845 --> 00:03:01,262
That's him, sergeant.

51
00:03:03,838 --> 00:03:05,402
Let's go, hombre.

52
00:03:09,987 --> 00:03:13,897
Son, we don't want to be
here any more than you do,

53
00:03:14,222 --> 00:03:20,329
and your pal Saddam had to go marchin'
into Kuwait, so here we all are.

54
00:03:20,795 --> 00:03:24,895
Buccelli here says you speak English.
You ever do any translatin'?

55
00:03:24,987 --> 00:03:26,794
Formally? No.

56
00:03:26,933 --> 00:03:32,419
Hell, fact you know what "formally"
means, well, we're good.

57
00:03:34,711 --> 00:03:37,853
Apache helicopter went down
in this sector two days ago.

58
00:03:37,992 --> 00:03:40,142
Our sources tell us
the pilot was captured.

59
00:03:40,223 --> 00:03:42,650
It's very important that
we get this pilot back.

60
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:47,172
We know he was taken to the local
Republican Guard
intelligence commander--

61
00:03:47,263 --> 00:03:48,687
a man named Tariq.

62
00:03:49,575 --> 00:03:50,856
Do you know him?

63
00:03:50,978 --> 00:03:53,785
Yes, he was our
commanding officer.

64
00:03:53,878 --> 00:03:55,970
You know where he is?

65
00:03:56,533 --> 00:04:00,151
When the bombing started,
he fled to Hillah.

66
00:04:01,647 --> 00:04:03,099
Hillah, huh?

67
00:04:04,688 --> 00:04:06,972
Yes, that is right.

68
00:04:12,446 --> 00:04:14,346
Welcome to Hillah.

69
00:04:31,845 --> 00:04:32,982
Where's Jack?

70
00:04:34,805 --> 00:04:35,897
Why?

71
00:04:45,159 --> 00:04:47,491
There. See?

72
00:04:51,373 --> 00:04:53,705
Go back. I'll deal with this.

73
00:04:53,852 --> 00:04:54,599
What?

74
00:04:55,862 --> 00:05:00,772
Go back, Ana Lucia,
and don't tell anyone what you saw.

75
00:05:32,588 --> 00:05:34,684
What are you doing
here, Danielle?

76
00:05:36,785 --> 00:05:38,064
Looking for you.

77
00:05:57,485 --> 00:05:58,807
Where are we going?

78
00:06:00,284 --> 00:06:03,287
You said you were looking for me.
What was your plan--

79
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:06,949
to hide in the woods,
hoping I would pass you by?

80
00:06:07,099 --> 00:06:10,376
I was going to wait until dark,
then find you at your tent.

81
00:06:10,516 --> 00:06:11,414
Why?

82
00:06:14,828 --> 00:06:16,069
We need to keep moving.

83
00:06:16,153 --> 00:06:18,435
Not until you tell me
where we're moving to.

84
00:06:18,763 --> 00:06:20,471
Trust me.

85
00:06:21,313 --> 00:06:22,879
The last time we met,

86
00:06:23,019 --> 00:06:25,269
you arrive to warn us
the others were coming,

87
00:06:25,295 --> 00:06:26,485
which they weren't.

88
00:06:26,665 --> 00:06:29,620
In fact, it was a diversion
to kidnap Claire's baby,

89
00:06:29,758 --> 00:06:32,137
so pardon me for
not trusting you.

90
00:06:34,241 --> 00:06:36,763
This place I'm taking you to--

91
00:06:36,933 --> 00:06:41,367
there is something that will help you,
something important.

92
00:06:45,352 --> 00:06:46,821
So trust.

93
00:06:50,696 --> 00:06:52,023
Take this.

94
00:06:59,516 --> 00:07:03,416
If I'm lying,
it's yours to use.

95
00:07:08,890 --> 00:07:10,502
How much further?

96
00:07:12,044 --> 00:07:13,276
Not  far.

97
00:07:15,849 --> 00:07:18,420
Ask him where he
took the pilot.

98
00:07:20,993 --> 00:07:24,326
They want to know
where the pilot is.

99
00:07:26,851 --> 00:07:29,565
Tell him his mother is a goat.

100
00:07:31,014 --> 00:07:32,723
He says he does not know.

101
00:07:33,238 --> 00:07:36,907
Look, we know for a fact he interrogated
the pilot day before yesterday--

102
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:38,501
hell, probably in this room.

103
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:46,328
Tell him we get our man back
safe and sound, he goes free.

104
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:53,102
They will let you go if you
tell them where the pilot is.

105
00:07:55,487 --> 00:07:57,483
You are a disgrace.

106
00:07:58,423 --> 00:07:59,936
You're an Iraqi soldier!

107
00:08:00,074 --> 00:08:02,706
Steal his gun and
kill them all.

108
00:08:04,470 --> 00:08:07,947
Right there on his belt.

109
00:08:08,883 --> 00:08:11,691
You can get a few of them
before you are killed.

110
00:08:13,233 --> 00:08:14,370
What's he saying?

111
00:08:15,866 --> 00:08:17,576
He says he does not know.

112
00:08:20,104 --> 00:08:23,053
I was born,
but I wasn't born yesterday, son.

113
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:27,052
Now you don't help me out here,
someone else will take over,

114
00:08:27,191 --> 00:08:32,149
and  that someone,
he won't play nice at all.

115
00:08:35,377 --> 00:08:38,626
I am sorry. He does not know.

116
00:08:41,235 --> 00:08:44,092
Okay. You had your chance.

117
00:08:46,009 --> 00:08:47,099
Guards?

118
00:08:48,687 --> 00:08:50,110
Lock him back up.

119
00:09:11,949 --> 00:09:13,276
This is unbelievable.

120
00:09:22,258 --> 00:09:24,790
Hey. Hey, you hear that thing?

121
00:09:25,482 --> 00:09:28,148
You hear that frog? The frog?

122
00:09:29,691 --> 00:09:31,640
You want to help me find it?

123
00:09:34,868 --> 00:09:37,070
What, we ain't friends anymore?

124
00:10:07,002 --> 00:10:08,901
What do you got there, Rerun?

125
00:10:09,006 --> 00:10:09,892
Nothin'.

126
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:16,324
Yeah, well, you got a spot of
"nothin'" on your chin, there.

127
00:10:20,337 --> 00:10:23,481
"Dharma initiative
ranch dressing."

128
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:27,300
You know, you're supposed to
refrigerate that after you open it.

129
00:10:28,030 --> 00:10:29,969
Well, actually on
the back it says

130
00:10:30,108 --> 00:10:32,822
it'll keep at room
temperature for up to 7 years.

131
00:10:36,279 --> 00:10:39,999
Well,  well,
looky who's got a secret stash.

132
00:10:40,088 --> 00:10:41,847
Please, dude, you can't tell.

133
00:10:42,553 --> 00:10:45,167
What, that you stole
food from the group?

134
00:10:47,597 --> 00:10:49,546
Now why would I
want to do that?

135
00:10:49,826 --> 00:10:51,444
Come on, man, please?

136
00:10:53,312 --> 00:10:54,830
Son of a bitch.

137
00:10:57,877 --> 00:10:59,778
Dude, it's just a tree frog.

138
00:10:59,969 --> 00:11:01,770
- Have you seen it?
- Yeah.

139
00:11:05,048 --> 00:11:06,229
Tell you what--

140
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:09,893
you help me find that thing,
you can keep right on ranch dippin'.

141
00:11:10,641 --> 00:11:12,112
We got a deal?

142
00:11:15,151 --> 00:11:16,768
How much further?

143
00:11:18,123 --> 00:11:19,930
- Danielle?
- We're here.

144
00:11:20,501 --> 00:11:22,494
And where exactly is "here"?

145
00:11:26,886 --> 00:11:28,739
What is that for, Danielle?

146
00:11:29,959 --> 00:11:30,465
Help me!

147
00:11:31,358 --> 00:11:34,173
Hey! Over here!

148
00:11:37,961 --> 00:11:38,667
Wait.

149
00:11:39,508 --> 00:11:42,223
- Help!
- Sayid, listen to me.

150
00:11:42,409 --> 00:11:47,179
Hey! Aah! Over here!

151
00:11:48,006 --> 00:11:50,095
Please! Help me!

152
00:11:52,906 --> 00:11:54,321
Help me!

153
00:11:54,461 --> 00:11:55,945
Don't believe a word he says.

154
00:11:56,118 --> 00:11:56,781
Hey!

155
00:11:58,134 --> 00:11:59,299
He's one of them.

156
00:11:59,533 --> 00:12:03,011
I have no idea what she's talking about.
She's crazy.

157
00:12:03,152 --> 00:12:04,445
How long has he been up there?

158
00:12:04,475 --> 00:12:07,858
Since last night.
Please, just cut me down.

159
00:12:07,997 --> 00:12:10,858
My name is Henry Gale.
I'm from Minnesota.

160
00:12:14,830 --> 00:12:16,827
- Please.
- He's lying.

161
00:12:20,756 --> 00:12:22,485
I'm going to cut him down.

162
00:12:22,559 --> 00:12:23,362
Don't.

163
00:12:24,467 --> 00:12:25,460
Thank you.

164
00:12:26,133 --> 00:12:28,206
You're making a
serious mistake.

165
00:12:32,089 --> 00:12:36,142
It's okay, it's okay.
You're all right. You're all right.

166
00:12:38,435 --> 00:12:39,193
Hold on.

167
00:12:41,571 --> 00:12:42,949
Take it easy.

168
00:12:46,555 --> 00:12:47,752
Oh, no.

169
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:48,591
Wait!

170
00:12:49,284 --> 00:12:50,895
Danielle, don't!

171
00:13:13,074 --> 00:13:14,707
You could have killed him.

172
00:13:15,769 --> 00:13:18,860
If I wanted to kill him,
I would have killed him.

173
00:13:20,684 --> 00:13:22,728
You shot this man
with no provocation.

174
00:13:22,868 --> 00:13:25,217
He is one of them!

175
00:13:26,649 --> 00:13:27,892
Tie him up.

176
00:13:28,881 --> 00:13:30,764
You should take
him to your doctor.

177
00:13:30,953 --> 00:13:32,708
He's no good to you dead.

178
00:13:32,803 --> 00:13:34,225
And then what?

179
00:13:35,208 --> 00:13:37,404
You talk to him, Sayid.

180
00:13:38,096 --> 00:13:41,670
As I recall,
that is what you do.

181
00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:45,955
But know this--

182
00:13:46,141 --> 00:13:47,612
he will lie.

183
00:13:48,219 --> 00:13:51,602
For a long time, he will lie.

184
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:35,995
I want to talk to you
about your buddy Tariq.

185
00:14:39,176 --> 00:14:40,791
All right, look, I get it.

186
00:14:41,165 --> 00:14:43,689
You're a man who
values loyalty.

187
00:14:44,108 --> 00:14:46,249
Even doing a little
translating for us,

188
00:14:46,388 --> 00:14:48,548
you feel like you're
doing the wrong thing.

189
00:14:48,854 --> 00:14:52,046
I get that, and I respect it.

190
00:14:56,490 --> 00:15:01,710
This is what Tariq was doing before he
took over command of your
intelligence unit.

191
00:15:02,672 --> 00:15:05,911
He was the head of a chemical
warfare battalion in the north,

192
00:15:06,425 --> 00:15:10,539
personally supervised the use
of Sarin gas on this village.

193
00:15:18,526 --> 00:15:21,000
You recognize it, don't you?

194
00:15:22,376 --> 00:15:25,740
You had relatives in that village,
didn't you, Sayid?

195
00:15:30,092 --> 00:15:33,138
So you know what
Sarin gas does.

196
00:15:34,633 --> 00:15:36,875
No discrimination.

197
00:15:37,196 --> 00:15:38,619
The entire marketplace.

198
00:15:39,182 --> 00:15:40,615
Innocent women...

199
00:15:41,352 --> 00:15:42,774
children.

200
00:15:48,295 --> 00:15:49,336
Enough...

201
00:15:50,833 --> 00:15:51,827
Please.

202
00:15:56,990 --> 00:16:00,320
Loyalty is a virtue,

203
00:16:00,916 --> 00:16:03,772
but unquestioning loyalty--

204
00:16:04,426 --> 00:16:06,437
I don't think that's you.

205
00:16:08,715 --> 00:16:10,916
Why  should I believe you?

206
00:16:13,056 --> 00:16:16,152
How do you think we knew you
had relatives in that village?

207
00:16:16,245 --> 00:16:20,202
We liberated your
personnel file and Tariq's.

208
00:16:25,607 --> 00:16:32,645
All we want is our pilot back,
so we can send him home to his family.

209
00:16:35,217 --> 00:16:37,840
Tariq will never talk to you.

210
00:16:38,631 --> 00:16:41,281
That's why you're gonna have
to make him talk to you.

211
00:16:50,995 --> 00:16:52,973
John. John, wake up.

212
00:16:59,057 --> 00:16:59,717
What?

213
00:17:00,837 --> 00:17:02,164
Come out here.

214
00:17:10,938 --> 00:17:12,970
Minnesota, huh?

215
00:17:14,781 --> 00:17:16,833
That's the question, isn't it?

216
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:25,870
Where am I?

217
00:17:26,617 --> 00:17:29,475
- Who are you?
- Henry. Henry Gale.

218
00:17:29,895 --> 00:17:31,240
Aah! My back!

219
00:17:33,609 --> 00:17:37,114
We're going to take it out,
but first I want you to relax.

220
00:17:38,865 --> 00:17:40,625
How did you get to this island?

221
00:17:40,884 --> 00:17:44,272
Four months ago,
we crashed, my wife and I.

222
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:47,265
- Crashed in what?
- A balloon.

223
00:17:47,873 --> 00:17:50,491
We were trying to
cross the Pacific.

224
00:17:53,159 --> 00:17:55,454
Your wife-- where is she?

225
00:17:57,078 --> 00:17:58,525
She died.

226
00:17:59,134 --> 00:18:04,117
She got...
she got sick three weeks ago.

227
00:18:05,779 --> 00:18:09,949
We were staying in a
cave off the beach.

228
00:18:11,001 --> 00:18:12,879
My shoulder.

229
00:18:14,095 --> 00:18:16,188
At least untie my arms!

230
00:18:16,327 --> 00:18:18,640
What the hell is going on here?

231
00:18:19,387 --> 00:18:21,648
Rousseau trapped
him in the jungle.

232
00:18:23,822 --> 00:18:28,804
- She believe she's an other.
- An "other" what?

233
00:18:28,968 --> 00:18:32,065
- You shot him with an arrow?
- Do I have a bow?

234
00:18:32,861 --> 00:18:35,914
Hey, hey, you with me?

235
00:18:37,264 --> 00:18:38,998
What, you were just gonna
let him bleed to death?

236
00:18:39,028 --> 00:18:42,690
I was trying to get honest answers
while he was able to give them...

237
00:18:42,835 --> 00:18:45,855
and his wound is far
from life-threatening.

238
00:18:46,017 --> 00:18:49,403
We should let Jack treat him first,
then we'll get our answers.

239
00:18:49,539 --> 00:18:50,803
Jack...

240
00:18:51,409 --> 00:18:53,713
do not untie him.

241
00:19:05,825 --> 00:19:08,642
This is how people get
killed in scary movies.

242
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:13,264
If it were a scary movie, I'd be
with a hot chick, not you, Barbar.

243
00:19:15,836 --> 00:19:18,623
- It's Babar.
- How about you shut up, Hammo,

244
00:19:18,829 --> 00:19:23,484
or your ranch disorder's gonna be the
new lead item on the coconut internet.

245
00:19:24,101 --> 00:19:27,290
Fine. Go ahead.

246
00:19:28,170 --> 00:19:31,171
Tell everyone the fat guy's
been hiding ranch dressing,

247
00:19:31,265 --> 00:19:33,241
the fat guy who likes to eat.

248
00:19:33,784 --> 00:19:35,504
Yeah, I'm fat.

249
00:19:35,914 --> 00:19:40,324
Fat, fat, fat, fat, fat.
You think I don't know that?

250
00:19:41,357 --> 00:19:43,358
At least people like me.

251
00:19:45,973 --> 00:19:48,592
You know what?
Find the damn frog by yourself.

252
00:19:49,668 --> 00:19:51,092
Hurley, wait!

253
00:19:51,278 --> 00:19:53,179
Wait! Hey, Hurley!

254
00:19:54,909 --> 00:19:57,623
Look, man, I'm sorry,
all right?

255
00:19:58,887 --> 00:20:02,439
This frog is killin' me.
You gotta help me out...

256
00:20:02,837 --> 00:20:04,263
Please.

257
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:43,881
So what do you think?

258
00:20:44,117 --> 00:20:46,035
What do you think, John?

259
00:20:47,084 --> 00:20:49,176
I think he's pretty convincing.

260
00:20:51,806 --> 00:20:53,659
Yes, he is.

261
00:20:55,006 --> 00:20:57,002
The real problem
is there's no way

262
00:20:57,142 --> 00:20:59,091
we can be sure he's
telling the truth.

263
00:21:01,570 --> 00:21:03,978
That is not necessarily true.

264
00:21:07,254 --> 00:21:10,637
Does Jack have the
combination to the armory?

265
00:21:12,133 --> 00:21:14,397
For now, he does.

266
00:21:15,032 --> 00:21:17,735
How long would it take
for you to change it?

267
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:30,694
If you're angry,

268
00:21:31,430 --> 00:21:33,524
looking for someone
to punish...

269
00:21:33,757 --> 00:21:36,351
Why  would I need
to punish anyone?

270
00:21:42,658 --> 00:21:48,279
I want to find out who he is.
I want the truth.

271
00:21:48,435 --> 00:21:50,391
And I think we both know
that Jack will have

272
00:21:50,421 --> 00:21:54,137
issues with what must be
done in order to get it.

273
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:03,124
So how long, John,
to change the combination?

274
00:22:03,591 --> 00:22:06,568
A couple minutes, tops.

275
00:22:06,731 --> 00:22:09,063
Then I suggest you get started.

276
00:22:21,091 --> 00:22:23,054
Did he say anything
while you were treat--

277
00:22:23,084 --> 00:22:24,084
No, he didn't.

278
00:22:25,616 --> 00:22:26,878
He was in shock.

279
00:22:30,248 --> 00:22:32,348
We can't just leave
him layin' here, Jack.

280
00:22:32,805 --> 00:22:34,872
People will see him
and create a panic.

281
00:22:35,282 --> 00:22:37,361
Yeah? Well,
where do you think we should put him?

282
00:22:37,391 --> 00:22:40,964
I say we put him in the armory.
It's secure.

283
00:22:41,673 --> 00:22:43,853
Better to err on the
side of safety, Jack,

284
00:22:43,947 --> 00:22:46,353
at least until we can be sure.

285
00:22:52,222 --> 00:22:52,835
Okay.

286
00:22:54,437 --> 00:22:55,321
For now.

287
00:23:23,776 --> 00:23:25,485
All right,
pull that cot in here.

288
00:23:25,905 --> 00:23:27,519
He shouldn't be on his back.

289
00:23:27,904 --> 00:23:29,000
Good idea.

290
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:39,337
Sayid!

291
00:23:41,347 --> 00:23:43,413
Hey, what the hell you doin'?

292
00:23:44,412 --> 00:23:45,783
What needs to be done.

293
00:23:56,376 --> 00:23:59,986
They're letting speak
to me alone now?

294
00:24:03,955 --> 00:24:08,599
You need to tell me where
the helicopter pilot is.

295
00:24:19,515 --> 00:24:21,765
This is their new bluff?

296
00:24:22,414 --> 00:24:24,945
That you're going
to torture me?

297
00:24:30,511 --> 00:24:33,465
They think you will do this?

298
00:24:33,650 --> 00:24:37,434
Sayid, you are a loyal soldier.

299
00:24:37,602 --> 00:24:39,575
The son of a great hero.

300
00:24:39,651 --> 00:24:41,643
Do not disgrace your father!

301
00:24:46,226 --> 00:24:48,278
You wouldn't dare harm me!

302
00:24:48,436 --> 00:24:51,679
You will follow my orders
as your commanding officer!

303
00:24:51,791 --> 00:24:53,100
Take that bag.

304
00:24:53,231 --> 00:24:55,632
Put it over your
head and tape it up.

305
00:24:55,801 --> 00:24:57,695
Kill yourself, now!

306
00:24:57,827 --> 00:24:59,114
That's an order.

307
00:24:59,348 --> 00:25:02,550
Do it and die with what
little honor you have left.

308
00:25:04,450 --> 00:25:07,288
You would have me
take my own life...

309
00:25:07,727 --> 00:25:10,393
the information
means nothing to you!

310
00:25:55,447 --> 00:25:58,506
The pilot was executed
two days ago.

311
00:25:58,770 --> 00:26:01,921
He is buried in a field
4 kilometers from here.

312
00:26:03,036 --> 00:26:05,010
I can take you there.

313
00:26:24,545 --> 00:26:28,228
Damn it. Sayid, open the door!

314
00:26:29,170 --> 00:26:31,280
- Sayid, answer me!
- Jack.

315
00:26:32,693 --> 00:26:34,743
Why isn't this
combination working, John?

316
00:26:37,216 --> 00:26:38,799
Did you change it?

317
00:26:39,746 --> 00:26:40,569
Yeah.

318
00:26:41,364 --> 00:26:43,822
Why would you do that?

319
00:26:45,878 --> 00:26:47,309
You're raising an army.

320
00:26:48,835 --> 00:26:49,538
What?

321
00:26:49,709 --> 00:26:52,065
And why you didn't ask me to help,
well, that's your business,

322
00:26:52,095 --> 00:26:54,715
but there's only one reason
to raise an army, Jack,

323
00:26:54,855 --> 00:26:56,666
and that's because
we're at war.

324
00:26:58,032 --> 00:26:59,445
And like it or not,

325
00:26:59,813 --> 00:27:03,936
whatever Sayid has to do behind that
door, that's a part of it, too.

326
00:27:05,316 --> 00:27:07,610
What if he's telling
the truth, John?

327
00:27:09,101 --> 00:27:10,969
What if he's not?

328
00:27:23,126 --> 00:27:23,977
Get up.

329
00:27:27,999 --> 00:27:29,279
What's happening?

330
00:27:31,158 --> 00:27:32,592
Here, let me help you.

331
00:27:40,388 --> 00:27:42,488
You said you've been
here for four months.

332
00:27:43,321 --> 00:27:44,132
What?

333
00:27:44,312 --> 00:27:47,364
You said you came to this
island four months ago, yes?

334
00:27:47,531 --> 00:27:48,807
Where am I?

335
00:27:50,511 --> 00:27:54,115
Please answer my question.

336
00:27:54,346 --> 00:27:59,753
Yeah-- yes, we landed four months ago,
maybe more.

337
00:28:00,206 --> 00:28:01,102
Who are you?

338
00:28:01,250 --> 00:28:03,158
And you were in a cave
for all that time?

339
00:28:03,188 --> 00:28:04,502
Off the beach...

340
00:28:05,964 --> 00:28:07,544
on the north shore
of the island.

341
00:28:07,574 --> 00:28:10,042
How far from this beach to
where you were captured?

342
00:28:10,072 --> 00:28:10,782
I don't know.

343
00:28:10,883 --> 00:28:12,783
-How many days' walk?
- Two-- two days.

344
00:28:12,876 --> 00:28:15,032
Why did you stay on
the beach for so long?

345
00:28:15,156 --> 00:28:16,535
Why wouldn't we?

346
00:28:17,833 --> 00:28:20,448
We wanted to be
there for flyovers.

347
00:28:20,628 --> 00:28:23,264
We had an emergency beacon--
a transmitter.

348
00:28:23,385 --> 00:28:26,716
- What kind of transmitter?
- An A.D.F. beacon.

349
00:28:27,582 --> 00:28:30,492
We wanted to make
sure we'd be spotted.

350
00:28:33,771 --> 00:28:37,967
Look, whatever you think I am,
I'm not.

351
00:28:39,184 --> 00:28:43,611
Please-- please just...
tell me your name.

352
00:28:43,695 --> 00:28:46,266
You wife--
what is her maiden name?

353
00:28:46,374 --> 00:28:47,329
Murphy.

354
00:28:47,457 --> 00:28:50,136
- Where did you meet her?
- University of Minnesota.

355
00:28:50,263 --> 00:28:51,834
How did she die?

356
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,648
She got sick.

357
00:28:55,017 --> 00:28:56,716
She got sick?

358
00:28:59,132 --> 00:29:01,301
It started as a fever.

359
00:29:01,907 --> 00:29:04,564
After two days,
she was delirious...

360
00:29:07,315 --> 00:29:09,076
then she died.

361
00:29:19,507 --> 00:29:22,207
I don't know why you're asking
me all these questions.

362
00:29:22,535 --> 00:29:25,852
I don't know why you're
treating me this way...

363
00:29:26,727 --> 00:29:29,299
why I have to explain
to you who I am

364
00:29:29,384 --> 00:29:31,910
when you don't tell
me who you are.

365
00:29:32,066 --> 00:29:35,934
I was 23 years old when the
americans came to my country.

366
00:29:36,817 --> 00:29:38,698
I was a good man.

367
00:29:38,838 --> 00:29:40,308
I was a soldier...

368
00:29:41,632 --> 00:29:42,929
and when they left,

369
00:29:44,447 --> 00:29:46,327
I was something different.

370
00:29:47,025 --> 00:29:48,353
For the next six years,

371
00:29:49,139 --> 00:29:52,583
I did things I wish I
could erase from my memory,

372
00:29:52,832 --> 00:29:56,366
things which I never thought
myself to be capable of...

373
00:29:58,708 --> 00:30:01,602
but I did come to learn this--

374
00:30:02,144 --> 00:30:06,131
there is a part of me
which was always capable.

375
00:30:08,094 --> 00:30:10,832
You want to know who I am?

376
00:30:14,646 --> 00:30:17,216
My name is Sayid Jarrah...

377
00:30:18,645 --> 00:30:20,983
and I am a torturer.

378
00:30:34,650 --> 00:30:35,835
Where is it?

379
00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:37,821
There it is.

380
00:30:49,835 --> 00:30:50,781
Gotcha.

381
00:30:51,389 --> 00:30:53,445
Dude, nice catch.

382
00:30:53,888 --> 00:30:55,324
Well, I'll be damned.

383
00:30:56,108 --> 00:30:58,407
All that noise from
this tiny critter.

384
00:30:59,928 --> 00:31:02,176
Kind of reminds me of
a turtle I once had.

385
00:31:02,641 --> 00:31:04,055
His name was Stewart.

386
00:31:04,447 --> 00:31:06,158
He ran off when I was 10.

387
00:31:07,328 --> 00:31:09,525
Well, that's what mom said.

388
00:31:09,770 --> 00:31:12,150
I kinda think she
threw him out.

389
00:31:16,152 --> 00:31:18,531
Well, you're a happy little fella,
ain't ya?

390
00:31:25,887 --> 00:31:27,133
I have an idea.

391
00:31:28,946 --> 00:31:32,486
Why don't I take
him far from here,

392
00:31:32,763 --> 00:31:34,289
two beaches away?

393
00:31:34,749 --> 00:31:36,841
Maybe I'll finda Mrs.
Tree frog.

394
00:31:37,815 --> 00:31:41,619
That way, he won't keep you up anymore,
and everyone's happy.

395
00:31:44,676 --> 00:31:46,937
Yeah,  that's one idea.

396
00:31:48,596 --> 00:31:50,276
Here's another.

397
00:31:53,672 --> 00:31:54,601
Dude.

398
00:31:57,377 --> 00:32:00,878
I hear with a little ranch,
they taste just like chicken.

399
00:32:27,998 --> 00:32:29,289
Give you a hand?

400
00:32:37,326 --> 00:32:39,587
- Jack, I know this--
- Shut up.

401
00:32:54,724 --> 00:32:56,463
Where are the pliers?

402
00:32:59,249 --> 00:33:00,876
Tell me about this balloon.

403
00:33:02,662 --> 00:33:03,398
What?

404
00:33:03,582 --> 00:33:06,966
This balloon that brought you here
with your wife-- tell me about it.

405
00:33:06,996 --> 00:33:08,263
What do you want to know?

406
00:33:09,761 --> 00:33:11,135
Everything.

407
00:33:15,892 --> 00:33:18,950
She's 140 feet high,
60 feet wide...

408
00:33:21,420 --> 00:33:22,783
and when she's up in the air,

409
00:33:22,813 --> 00:33:27,537
550,000 cubic feet of helium and
100,000 of hot air keep her up.

410
00:33:29,150 --> 00:33:31,224
And if you could
look down on her,

411
00:33:31,522 --> 00:33:35,833
you'd see a big,
yellow smiley face on top.

412
00:33:37,479 --> 00:33:40,440
Why would you
travelin that way?

413
00:33:42,374 --> 00:33:44,290
Because I was rich, because...

414
00:33:47,010 --> 00:33:48,468
it was my dream...

415
00:33:51,732 --> 00:33:54,740
and Jennifer thought
it would be neat.

416
00:33:55,926 --> 00:33:57,447
You were rich.

417
00:34:03,816 --> 00:34:06,504
I guess I'm thinking of
things in the past tense now.

418
00:34:07,276 --> 00:34:09,039
How's that for optimism?

419
00:34:10,146 --> 00:34:12,522
What did you do to
become so rich?

420
00:34:14,127 --> 00:34:16,698
-I sold my company.
- What kind of company?

421
00:34:17,070 --> 00:34:19,411
- Mining.
- What did you mine?

422
00:34:20,571 --> 00:34:23,399
We mined nonmetallic minerals.

423
00:34:25,673 --> 00:34:29,294
I know, everyone wanted to talk
to me at cocktail parties.

424
00:34:36,968 --> 00:34:38,700
Give me your hands.

425
00:34:40,685 --> 00:34:42,264
Give me your hands!

426
00:34:48,787 --> 00:34:50,297
Where is she buried?

427
00:34:50,539 --> 00:34:52,388
- What?
- Listen to me.

428
00:34:53,062 --> 00:34:55,617
You said you buried your wife.
Tell me where.

429
00:34:56,625 --> 00:34:58,618
- What are you gonna--
- Wwhere?!

430
00:34:58,699 --> 00:35:00,070
In the jungle!

431
00:35:01,112 --> 00:35:03,155
By the balloon, in the jungle.

432
00:35:03,278 --> 00:35:06,278
How deep?
How deep did you dig the grave?

433
00:35:06,446 --> 00:35:07,134
I don't...

434
00:35:07,403 --> 00:35:10,122
How deep?
How many shovelfuls of earth?

435
00:35:10,295 --> 00:35:13,208
Did you use your hands?
How long did it take you?!

436
00:35:13,305 --> 00:35:16,049
- I don't remember!
- You would remember!

437
00:35:16,158 --> 00:35:18,409
You would remember how deep!

438
00:35:18,534 --> 00:35:21,917
You would remember every shovelful,
every moment!

439
00:35:22,074 --> 00:35:26,634
You would remember what it felt
like to place her body inside.

440
00:35:26,915 --> 00:35:30,942
You would remember if you
buried the woman you loved.

441
00:35:31,598 --> 00:35:35,664
You would remember,
if it were true!

442
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:41,775
Did you...
did you lose someone?

443
00:35:42,738 --> 00:35:45,164
Did you lose someone
here on the island?

444
00:35:45,458 --> 00:35:47,213
Did you lose someone, too?

445
00:35:47,395 --> 00:35:48,994
What happened to her?

446
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:57,907
It was an accident.
It was an accident.

447
00:35:58,017 --> 00:36:01,528
The woman responsible
thought she was someone else,

448
00:36:01,708 --> 00:36:03,637
someone coming to hurt her.

449
00:36:04,519 --> 00:36:06,351
Someone like you!

450
00:36:06,536 --> 00:36:09,369
Just-- just--
this is all a mistake.

451
00:36:09,742 --> 00:36:11,359
Slow down here, okay?

452
00:36:12,026 --> 00:36:14,242
Hurting me isn't
gonna bring her back.

453
00:36:14,385 --> 00:36:16,096
You know what I lost!

454
00:36:16,552 --> 00:36:17,943
Tell me the truth!

455
00:36:18,804 --> 00:36:20,396
Tell me who you are!

456
00:36:20,816 --> 00:36:23,899
No! No! No! Help! Stop!

457
00:36:24,069 --> 00:36:27,079
Tell me the truth!
Tell me who you are!

458
00:36:28,530 --> 00:36:29,701
Sayid!

459
00:36:30,895 --> 00:36:32,005
Sayid!

460
00:36:32,208 --> 00:36:32,907
Jack.

461
00:36:34,032 --> 00:36:37,831
- Open it. Open it now.
- Jack, this has to happen.

462
00:36:39,085 --> 00:36:42,278
Open that damn door, you understand me?!
You open it now!

463
00:36:42,447 --> 00:36:43,144
No.

464
00:36:43,612 --> 00:36:44,843
Now!

465
00:36:50,176 --> 00:36:51,576
What do you want me to say?!

466
00:36:52,252 --> 00:36:55,805
Whatever you want me to do, I'll do it!
Just-- please...

467
00:36:57,369 --> 00:36:59,452
I want you to tell
me the truth!

468
00:36:59,601 --> 00:37:00,601
Open the door.

469
00:37:03,168 --> 00:37:04,832
- Let go of me, Jack.
- Or what?

470
00:37:04,990 --> 00:37:07,506
You want to pushthe button?
Open the door.

471
00:37:12,951 --> 00:37:16,039
It's under a minute now, John.
You better think fast.

472
00:37:16,182 --> 00:37:18,756
- You wouldn't.
- What? I wouldn't what?

473
00:37:18,939 --> 00:37:22,757
If we don't...
you would risk everyone's lives?

474
00:37:23,059 --> 00:37:27,164
You talked me into pushing that button
once, John, but it's yours now.

475
00:37:27,253 --> 00:37:29,033
You're the onewho
won't risk it, you.

476
00:37:29,063 --> 00:37:32,048
Me? I don't think anything's gonna
happen when we get down to zero.

477
00:37:32,078 --> 00:37:32,485
Jack...

478
00:37:32,626 --> 00:37:34,062
You want to see
what's gonna happen?

479
00:37:34,092 --> 00:37:36,139
Let's just see
what's gonna happen.

480
00:37:36,572 --> 00:37:40,304
Who are you?! Who are you?!

481
00:37:45,987 --> 00:37:48,943
Okay, okay, okay,
right, 15, left--

482
00:37:49,033 --> 00:37:52,118
You think I'm stupid?
You open it!

483
00:38:34,008 --> 00:38:35,566
- He's lying!
- Not like this!

484
00:38:35,742 --> 00:38:37,036
I'll tell you
whatever you want!

485
00:38:37,066 --> 00:38:39,354
He's lying! He's lying!

486
00:38:40,425 --> 00:38:41,278
That's enough!

487
00:38:55,967 --> 00:38:57,734
What the hell was that?

488
00:38:59,081 --> 00:39:00,612
He is one of them.

489
00:39:00,928 --> 00:39:03,389
Yeah? Did he tell you that?

490
00:39:03,978 --> 00:39:06,197
- No.
- Then how do you know?

491
00:39:07,879 --> 00:39:12,216
Because I know.
He is one of them.

492
00:39:14,693 --> 00:39:17,643
I think that's what Rousseau
thought about you once, Sayid.

493
00:39:17,879 --> 00:39:19,849
If I'm not mistaken,
she strapped you down,

494
00:39:19,879 --> 00:39:22,979
she shocked you, all because she
thought you were one of them.

495
00:39:23,573 --> 00:39:26,388
- He is.
- What?

496
00:39:27,598 --> 00:39:29,311
He is one of them.

497
00:39:29,487 --> 00:39:32,640
To Rousseau,
we're all "others."

498
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:37,489
I guess it's all relative, huh?

499
00:40:08,103 --> 00:40:11,207
You got a wife? Kids?

500
00:40:40,870 --> 00:40:42,371
I'll take him.

501
00:40:48,086 --> 00:40:50,790
It's over.
We're pulling out, not going to Baghdad.

502
00:40:52,533 --> 00:40:55,592
So your man Saddam gets to stay
in power, which means you,

503
00:40:55,699 --> 00:40:58,557
in all likelihood,
will remain in his employ.

504
00:40:59,323 --> 00:41:02,628
Guess you're lucky to have
a new skill set you can use.

505
00:41:04,326 --> 00:41:05,834
What you made me do,

506
00:41:06,033 --> 00:41:09,502
no human being should ever
have to do to another.

507
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:14,959
One of these days...

508
00:41:15,233 --> 00:41:18,347
there will be something
you need to know.

509
00:41:19,858 --> 00:41:21,148
And now...

510
00:41:21,337 --> 00:41:23,581
you know how to get it.

511
00:41:25,434 --> 00:41:28,066
I will never do that again.

512
00:41:30,625 --> 00:41:31,601
Yeah.

513
00:41:36,857 --> 00:41:39,265
Good luck to you, Sayid.

514
00:41:40,362 --> 00:41:42,555
Bus fare back to Ramadi.

515
00:41:43,483 --> 00:41:44,743
Let's move out.

516
00:42:09,421 --> 00:42:11,568
There is a man down
in the hatch...

517
00:42:13,272 --> 00:42:15,406
a stranger captured
by Rousseau.

518
00:42:17,991 --> 00:42:19,603
I beat him.

519
00:42:21,398 --> 00:42:23,844
I beat him badly.

520
00:42:28,410 --> 00:42:30,563
Why are you telling
me this, Sayid?

521
00:42:33,449 --> 00:42:35,554
Jack asked me how I knew--

522
00:42:35,944 --> 00:42:39,106
knew for sure that
this man was lying,

523
00:42:39,497 --> 00:42:43,666
how I knew for sure that he was
one of them, one of the others.

524
00:42:46,014 --> 00:42:51,039
I know because I feel no
guilt for what I did to him.

525
00:42:58,232 --> 00:43:02,838
But there is no way I can ever
explain that to Jack or even Locke...

526
00:43:03,365 --> 00:43:05,825
because both of them
have forgotten.

527
00:43:06,634 --> 00:43:08,949
Forgotten? What?

528
00:43:10,181 --> 00:43:13,477
That you were strung up by
your neck and left for dead,
