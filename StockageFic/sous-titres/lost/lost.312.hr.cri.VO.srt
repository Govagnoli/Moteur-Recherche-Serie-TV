00:00:00,204 --> 00:00:01,748
<i>Previously on </i>Lost...

2
00:00:01,902 --> 00:00:03,291
I don't care what Jack said.

3
00:00:03,368 --> 00:00:05,915
They've got him.
We have to get him back. I owe him that.

4
00:00:06,445 --> 00:00:08,563
The man in the house.
You said you seen him before?

5
00:00:08,572 --> 00:00:10,419
On the video feed
from the pearl station.

6
00:00:10,544 --> 00:00:13,033
Why are we continuing
to play this little game,

7
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:15,666
when we all know
it has moved to the next stage?

8
00:00:19,736 --> 00:00:21,926
This is a map
showing electrical and data cabling

9
00:00:22,086 --> 00:00:23,787
comprised of houses and dormitories.

10
00:00:23,903 --> 00:00:25,823
Sounds like a place well worth visiting.

11
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:28,818
I saw a lightning hit the roof.

12
00:00:29,204 --> 00:00:30,496
You were electrocuted.

13
00:00:30,593 --> 00:00:33,584
And when you heard Claire was in
the water, you drown trying to save her.

14
00:00:33,622 --> 00:00:35,359
I dove in myself so you never went in.

15
00:00:35,474 --> 00:00:38,079
I'm trying pal,
I tried twice to save you, but...

16
00:00:38,204 --> 00:00:39,747
no matter what I try to do...

17
00:00:39,979 --> 00:00:41,599
you gonna die Charlie.

18
00:01:30,893 --> 00:01:31,954
Mom!

19
00:01:48,913 --> 00:01:50,322
Oh look, Aaron!

20
00:01:50,437 --> 00:01:52,945
Your mom has finaly decided to wake up.

21
00:01:57,373 --> 00:01:59,138
The only way I could get you to sleep in

22
00:01:59,341 --> 00:02:00,788
was to borrow the midget.

23
00:02:03,026 --> 00:02:05,086
And, what is all this?

24
00:02:05,221 --> 00:02:09,256
An aperitive,
of mysterious island fruit.

25
00:02:09,688 --> 00:02:11,596
Before the breakfast picnic

26
00:02:11,711 --> 00:02:14,064
I have set up in your honor

27
00:02:14,792 --> 00:02:16,341
a short walk down the beach.

28
00:02:17,097 --> 00:02:18,660
What's gotten into you, Charlie?

29
00:02:18,881 --> 00:02:19,884
Sorry?

30
00:02:19,905 --> 00:02:21,811
It's just, you've been
so depressed all week,

31
00:02:21,875 --> 00:02:25,838
and now it's breakfast in bed
and picnics?

32
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:27,580
I woke up this morning, and I thought,

33
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:30,793
it's time to stop feeling sorry
for yourself and seize the day,

34
00:02:30,905 --> 00:02:32,777
and I can't think
of anyone I'd rather do

35
00:02:32,854 --> 00:02:35,806
some day-seizing with than you.

36
00:02:37,882 --> 00:02:39,556
So... What do you say?

37
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:43,327
Let's drop
the cherub off with auntie Sun

38
00:02:43,679 --> 00:02:46,790
and uncle Jin, and you and I

39
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:49,111
go for a little stroll.

40
00:02:50,188 --> 00:02:51,188
I would love to.

41
00:02:54,253 --> 00:02:55,603
From the position of this stream,

42
00:02:55,622 --> 00:02:58,694
we should be here,
and if the scale is right,

43
00:02:59,254 --> 00:03:01,531
his people
are 2 miles in that direction.

44
00:03:03,858 --> 00:03:05,802
I don't expect you to confirm that.

45
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:12,181
It's an electrical wiring map, Sayid.

46
00:03:12,274 --> 00:03:14,073
I'm not sure
it's as accurate as you think.

47
00:03:14,074 --> 00:03:17,397
Well, it's certainly not as infallible
as the magical carvings on your stick.

48
00:03:17,428 --> 00:03:19,666
Hey, the stick
didget us to that station.

49
00:03:19,733 --> 00:03:22,342
Oh, the station which
you accidentally blew up.

50
00:03:22,401 --> 00:03:25,122
If you'd have warned me
that the basement was rigged with C-4,

51
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:26,964
I might've been a little more careful.

52
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:34,862
Why don't you just tell us
if we're going the right way?

53
00:03:35,558 --> 00:03:37,058
You're going the right way.

54
00:03:37,259 --> 00:03:38,909
Remind me why we're keeping him alive.

55
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:40,752
What do you suggest,
we shoot him like a dog?

56
00:03:40,772 --> 00:03:42,585
No. I like dogs.

57
00:03:42,765 --> 00:03:46,098
He's right. They would not trade
his life for your friend's.

58
00:03:46,471 --> 00:03:48,042
- We should shoot him.
- Enough!

59
00:03:48,156 --> 00:03:49,669
Nobody's shooting anybody.

60
00:03:50,477 --> 00:03:52,977
The map says where they are,
and he says the map is right,

61
00:03:53,228 --> 00:03:54,540
so just keep moving.

62
00:04:01,621 --> 00:04:03,562
Okay, here we are, here we are.

63
00:04:05,098 --> 00:04:06,098
Not bad, eh?

64
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,299
Not bad at all.

65
00:04:08,164 --> 00:04:10,155
Well, if you'll take your seat,

66
00:04:10,193 --> 00:04:15,210
we will begin with our first course,
which is cereal.

67
00:04:15,786 --> 00:04:18,082
- We have fresh fruit salad--
- Good morning.

68
00:04:19,697 --> 00:04:22,428
Good morning yourself.

69
00:04:23,555 --> 00:04:25,065
What brings you down to the beach?

70
00:04:25,125 --> 00:04:26,244
Boar are running thick.

71
00:04:26,467 --> 00:04:29,189
I was hoping you might
want to join me on a hunt.

72
00:04:30,371 --> 00:04:31,701
Oh. Well...

73
00:04:32,925 --> 00:04:34,631
Thanks for the invite, but...

74
00:04:35,082 --> 00:04:38,558
as you can see,
we're just about to begin a picnic.

75
00:04:38,655 --> 00:04:40,777
Well, I think hunting might be a...

76
00:04:41,317 --> 00:04:43,478
a better way to spend your day, Charlie.

77
00:04:44,113 --> 00:04:46,833
I mean, of all the things
you could choose to do today,

78
00:04:46,995 --> 00:04:48,852
hunting with me might be
your best option.

79
00:04:48,909 --> 00:04:51,668
Oh, my God.

80
00:04:52,129 --> 00:04:53,132
What is it?

81
00:04:53,171 --> 00:04:55,234
I think I know
how to get us off this island.

82
00:05:09,818 --> 00:05:21,534
Subtitles: swsub.com

83
00:05:24,987 --> 00:05:26,431
Claire, what's the matter?

84
00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:28,520
I need Jin's nets and fish.

85
00:05:28,743 --> 00:05:31,288
We've gotta hurry. And buckets...
I'm gonna need those, too.

86
00:05:32,275 --> 00:05:34,282
- We have to catch the birds.
- What birds?

87
00:05:34,302 --> 00:05:36,631
They just flew over, and they're
only gonna be here today,

88
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:38,247
so to catch one, we need to do it now.

89
00:05:38,248 --> 00:05:39,636
Oh, this sounds like fun.

90
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:42,128
Can you get some nets?

91
00:05:42,147 --> 00:05:43,613
Nets for what, Barb...

92
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,471
Nets for what, Claire?

93
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:52,969
Okay, five minutes ago,
a flock of sea birds flew over my head.

94
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:56,527
Seabirds are migratory, which means
they're gonna keep heading south.

95
00:05:57,876 --> 00:05:59,875
I'm sorry. I don't understand
why we need to...

96
00:05:59,971 --> 00:06:00,993
They're tagged.

97
00:06:01,079 --> 00:06:02,079
Tagged?

98
00:06:02,731 --> 00:06:05,171
Scientists tag these birds
so they can track them.

99
00:06:05,248 --> 00:06:08,911
So when they eventually land
in Australia or New Zealand or wherever,

100
00:06:09,624 --> 00:06:11,264
somebody's gonna gather them up.

101
00:06:13,145 --> 00:06:14,547
We can send a message.

102
00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:15,961
If we can catch one.

103
00:06:16,098 --> 00:06:17,151
Okay, so here's the plan.

104
00:06:17,152 --> 00:06:19,122
First, we've gotta cut up
these fish, make chum.

105
00:06:19,141 --> 00:06:20,974
That'll get the birds
to settle in the water.

106
00:06:21,010 --> 00:06:24,019
And then, um, we're gonna need
to cut up some of this net.

107
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:26,168
Charlie, can you go get some knives?

108
00:06:34,507 --> 00:06:37,084
How do you even know
this stuff about birds?

109
00:06:37,890 --> 00:06:39,858
I watched a lot of nature shows
with my mum.

110
00:06:39,896 --> 00:06:41,729
Doesn't exactly make you an expert.

111
00:06:43,342 --> 00:06:47,304
I just-- I don't want to see you
wasting your time, that's all.

112
00:06:49,849 --> 00:06:51,987
So what happened to seizing the day?

113
00:06:55,207 --> 00:06:56,207
Sorry.

114
00:06:57,562 --> 00:06:58,673
Don't see the point.

115
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:14,401
Hold still, dear. Just another second.

116
00:07:16,087 --> 00:07:17,087
There.

117
00:07:17,891 --> 00:07:18,891
We're through now.

118
00:07:24,502 --> 00:07:26,390
Ms. Littleton, I'm Officer Barnes.

119
00:07:26,604 --> 00:07:29,406
Sorry to bother you,
but I need to ask you a few questions.

120
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:31,732
Can I ask you how the accident happened?

121
00:07:33,766 --> 00:07:35,762
A truck forced us off the road.

122
00:07:37,256 --> 00:07:39,358
Okay, and who was driving?

123
00:07:42,823 --> 00:07:43,903
Me.

124
00:07:46,371 --> 00:07:47,914
Has anyone contacted your father?

125
00:07:48,105 --> 00:07:49,591
My father died when I was 2.

126
00:07:49,938 --> 00:07:50,993
Sorry to hear that.

127
00:07:53,445 --> 00:07:54,976
I spoke with the truck driver.

128
00:07:55,043 --> 00:07:56,265
He's fine, by the way.

129
00:07:56,348 --> 00:07:59,200
- He said that when you hit him...
- No, he hit us.

130
00:08:00,302 --> 00:08:03,696
About what speed would you say
that happened when you were driving?

131
00:08:03,735 --> 00:08:05,180
It just came out of nowhere.

132
00:08:05,257 --> 00:08:07,527
That's not the question
I asked, Ms. Littleton.

133
00:08:08,814 --> 00:08:11,491
I don't know how fast I was driving.

134
00:08:12,767 --> 00:08:15,311
Why are you even asking me
these questions?

135
00:08:15,875 --> 00:08:18,713
These questions are standard procedure
when there's a fatality.

136
00:08:20,851 --> 00:08:22,491
My mother is in surgery.

137
00:08:23,385 --> 00:08:24,385
She's not dead.

138
00:08:25,172 --> 00:08:26,195
Right.

139
00:08:28,444 --> 00:08:29,444
So she is.

140
00:08:29,501 --> 00:08:31,223
You know, this is not my fault!

141
00:08:33,649 --> 00:08:34,649
Didn't say it was.

142
00:08:35,304 --> 00:08:36,510
Good day, Ms. Littleton.

143
00:08:51,062 --> 00:08:52,451
Can I ask you something?

144
00:09:04,996 --> 00:09:07,683
I told you that your daughter
was living with them...

145
00:09:10,355 --> 00:09:13,034
end you haven't asked me
a single question about her.

146
00:09:13,767 --> 00:09:16,323
- You haven't--
- Your friend Jack,

147
00:09:17,398 --> 00:09:18,524
you care about him?

148
00:09:21,369 --> 00:09:22,369
Yes.

149
00:09:23,798 --> 00:09:25,593
Imagine 16 years from now,

150
00:09:26,345 --> 00:09:27,696
you're told he's still alive.

151
00:09:28,581 --> 00:09:33,071
But in your heart,
you know that he wouldn't remember you.

152
00:09:33,687 --> 00:09:34,853
He wouldn't know you.

153
00:09:36,891 --> 00:09:40,208
Wouldn't even know
that you ever cared about him.

154
00:09:49,412 --> 00:09:51,823
I haven't asked you questions
about my daughter...

155
00:09:54,067 --> 00:09:56,324
because I do not want
to know the answers.

156
00:10:13,262 --> 00:10:14,344
Water?

157
00:10:14,796 --> 00:10:16,129
No, thank you.

158
00:10:18,003 --> 00:10:19,225
So how'd you get here?

159
00:10:19,866 --> 00:10:21,380
How'd you get onto this island?

160
00:10:21,443 --> 00:10:22,689
Don't waste your breath.

161
00:10:22,826 --> 00:10:24,562
Whatever he says will be a lie.

162
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:27,034
I was recruited when I was 24.

163
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:30,268
- I was approached by a man...
- I didn't ask you when I asked you how.

164
00:10:31,271 --> 00:10:32,939
They brought me on the submarine.

165
00:10:33,523 --> 00:10:36,377
So your people, they can just come
and go whenever they want?

166
00:10:36,416 --> 00:10:37,530
Go, yes,

167
00:10:37,962 --> 00:10:40,038
but two weeks ago,
our underwater beacon

168
00:10:40,115 --> 00:10:41,867
stopped emitting its locator signal.

169
00:10:42,636 --> 00:10:45,746
There was an event...
an electromagnetic pulse.

170
00:10:46,192 --> 00:10:47,814
It would be impossible to come back.

171
00:10:47,893 --> 00:10:49,243
Why would you want to come back?

172
00:10:49,244 --> 00:10:50,632
You would not understand.

173
00:10:54,501 --> 00:10:55,501
Try me.

174
00:10:56,407 --> 00:10:57,407
I misspoke.

175
00:10:58,358 --> 00:11:01,788
What I mnt to say is,
you're not capable of understanding.

176
00:11:01,864 --> 00:11:03,222
And why am I not capable?

177
00:11:04,919 --> 00:11:06,696
Because you are not on the list.

178
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:10,535
What list?

179
00:11:15,284 --> 00:11:16,768
The man who brought me here,

180
00:11:16,923 --> 00:11:18,794
who brought all of my people here,

181
00:11:19,257 --> 00:11:22,006
he is... a magnificent man.

182
00:11:24,647 --> 00:11:26,005
If Ben's so magnificent,

183
00:11:26,021 --> 00:11:28,047
then why did he need one of us
to save him?

184
00:11:28,105 --> 00:11:30,217
Ben? Ben is not...

185
00:11:33,611 --> 00:11:35,999
I will try to make this
as simple as I can.

186
00:11:36,466 --> 00:11:39,188
You are not on the list
because you are flawed...

187
00:11:41,219 --> 00:11:42,552
Because you are angry...

188
00:11:44,627 --> 00:11:47,184
And weak and frightened.

189
00:11:48,226 --> 00:11:49,730
The more I learn about your people,

190
00:11:49,731 --> 00:11:53,023
the more I suspect you're not
as omniscient as you'd have us believe.

191
00:11:54,179 --> 00:11:56,147
Don't speak to us as if you know us.

192
00:11:56,493 --> 00:11:58,770
Of course I don't know you,
Sayid Jarrah.

193
00:11:59,348 --> 00:12:00,348
How could I?

194
00:12:02,307 --> 00:12:05,195
And you, Kate Austen,
are a complete stranger to me.

195
00:12:08,359 --> 00:12:09,730
But you, John Locke,

196
00:12:10,348 --> 00:12:13,859
you, I might have a fleeting memory of,
but I must be confused,

197
00:12:14,024 --> 00:12:16,246
because the John Locke
I know was para...

198
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:19,973
Look at this.

199
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:28,188
Over here. Come on.

200
00:13:12,729 --> 00:13:15,469
Well, looks like we're here.

201
00:13:22,448 --> 00:13:24,122
- Will this work?
- Yes.

202
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:26,078
Work.

203
00:13:35,951 --> 00:13:37,610
Please... Help.

204
00:13:46,743 --> 00:13:48,130
Smells great.

205
00:13:48,447 --> 00:13:49,724
Let's get it over with.

206
00:13:53,955 --> 00:13:55,732
This was my mother's worst fear.

207
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:57,460
What do you mean?

208
00:13:57,561 --> 00:14:00,184
That I would end up
doing something very much like this,

209
00:14:00,262 --> 00:14:01,502
cutting bait.

210
00:14:01,663 --> 00:14:03,573
She had high hopes for my future.

211
00:14:04,818 --> 00:14:07,651
They did not include
me marrying a fisherman's son.

212
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:13,073
Well, I guess we don't always turn out
like our mothers want.

213
00:14:13,434 --> 00:14:16,045
Of course,
mine never worked a day in her life.

214
00:14:21,545 --> 00:14:23,669
My mom was a librarian.

215
00:14:24,998 --> 00:14:25,998
Was?

216
00:14:32,669 --> 00:14:34,579
We should get this stuff out there.

217
00:14:56,268 --> 00:14:57,329
Where were you?

218
00:15:00,551 --> 00:15:02,162
I went home to take a shower.

219
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:04,540
That must have been nice.

220
00:15:04,693 --> 00:15:06,552
They said she was still in surgery.

221
00:15:09,315 --> 00:15:11,500
I had glass in my hair, Aunt Lindsey.

222
00:15:11,972 --> 00:15:15,614
Well, I'm glad
that you're feeling refreshed.

223
00:15:19,479 --> 00:15:20,479
Good afternoon.

224
00:15:21,152 --> 00:15:22,329
Are you the daughter?

225
00:15:23,682 --> 00:15:25,626
I'm Dr. Woodruff from neurosurgery.

226
00:15:25,997 --> 00:15:28,108
I'll be observing your mother
for the next few days.

227
00:15:28,166 --> 00:15:29,188
How is she?

228
00:15:29,943 --> 00:15:32,237
We've managed to stabilize
her immediate injuries...

229
00:15:34,130 --> 00:15:36,213
But your mother
suffered a severe head trauma.

230
00:15:37,111 --> 00:15:39,501
We'll have to wait for the swelling
in her brain to go down

231
00:15:39,559 --> 00:15:42,033
before we can determine
the full extent of her injuries.

232
00:15:44,263 --> 00:15:45,314
But...

233
00:15:46,059 --> 00:15:48,548
I'm afraid we're looking
at fairly widespread damage.

234
00:15:50,234 --> 00:15:51,515
What does that mean?

235
00:15:51,723 --> 00:15:55,060
It means that right now these machines
are sustaining her life.

236
00:15:57,380 --> 00:15:58,768
But it won't always be...

237
00:16:00,137 --> 00:16:01,689
I mean, when she wakes up, she won't...

238
00:16:01,690 --> 00:16:03,809
I can't say with any real confidence

239
00:16:05,394 --> 00:16:06,505
that she will wake up.

240
00:16:23,018 --> 00:16:24,018
Can she hear us?

241
00:16:24,571 --> 00:16:25,904
I like to think she can.

242
00:16:26,574 --> 00:16:28,123
How long will she be like this?

243
00:16:28,161 --> 00:16:30,203
Could be a day, a week or years.

244
00:16:30,533 --> 00:16:32,310
We'll just have to wait and see.

245
00:16:33,289 --> 00:16:35,643
But I can assure you,
she'll be well looked after.

246
00:16:35,788 --> 00:16:37,333
Oh, that's very nice,

247
00:16:38,124 --> 00:16:39,494
but we can't pay for that.

248
00:16:39,552 --> 00:16:42,617
Don't worry. Her expenses
have already been taken care of.

249
00:16:48,004 --> 00:16:49,004
By whom?

250
00:16:49,822 --> 00:16:52,021
I've been asked
to keep that confidential.

251
00:17:15,403 --> 00:17:16,407
One...

252
00:17:17,541 --> 00:17:18,583
Two...

253
00:17:31,006 --> 00:17:32,086
Look, I'm sorry.

254
00:17:33,009 --> 00:17:34,032
I'm sorry, man.

255
00:17:35,156 --> 00:17:36,738
What the hell is wrong with you?

256
00:17:36,797 --> 00:17:39,492
I was shooting at a boar.
I had no idea you were out here.

257
00:17:39,675 --> 00:17:42,316
- Where's Charlie? Is he with you?
- He's back at the camp.

258
00:17:42,355 --> 00:17:44,764
- I'm really sorry if I frightened--
- So it's just you?

259
00:17:46,072 --> 00:17:47,544
- Aye, it's just me.
- Hunting,

260
00:17:47,737 --> 00:17:50,535
in the exact same spot
as we're setting our trap?

261
00:17:51,758 --> 00:17:53,668
I was following a boar, Claire.

262
00:17:54,802 --> 00:17:56,442
So it's just a coincidence, then.

263
00:17:57,958 --> 00:17:58,958
Where is it?

264
00:18:00,814 --> 00:18:01,814
It got away.

265
00:18:08,284 --> 00:18:10,576
You don't want me to catch the birds,
do you?

266
00:18:10,787 --> 00:18:13,660
You and Charlie-- what's going on?

267
00:18:14,493 --> 00:18:16,382
Why wouldn't I want you
to catch the birds?

268
00:18:31,816 --> 00:18:32,816
What is it?

269
00:18:33,422 --> 00:18:34,422
Don't touch it!

270
00:18:34,872 --> 00:18:36,149
Don't even get near it.

271
00:18:42,387 --> 00:18:43,609
What are these pylons?

272
00:18:45,193 --> 00:18:46,774
What do you think they are?

273
00:18:50,193 --> 00:18:51,359
A security perimeter.

274
00:18:52,547 --> 00:18:54,880
Those sensors on the side
would be triggered

275
00:18:55,307 --> 00:18:56,973
if anyone passed between them.

276
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:03,259
It's an alarm system or a trap.

277
00:19:04,263 --> 00:19:06,291
Either way,
we'll be safer going around it.

278
00:19:06,468 --> 00:19:07,468
You are right.

279
00:19:07,818 --> 00:19:09,502
It was a security perimeter,

280
00:19:10,293 --> 00:19:13,377
but like everything else on this island,
it hasn't functioned in years.

281
00:19:13,527 --> 00:19:14,638
Of course it hasn't.

282
00:19:17,332 --> 00:19:19,403
If you wish
to waste your time, be my guest.

283
00:19:20,213 --> 00:19:22,335
The pylons encircle the entire barracks.

284
00:19:23,291 --> 00:19:24,780
There is no going around them.

285
00:19:25,688 --> 00:19:27,887
If you don't believe me,
look at your map.

286
00:19:41,018 --> 00:19:42,723
He appears to be telling the truth.

287
00:19:55,157 --> 00:19:56,180
Thank you.

288
00:20:20,607 --> 00:20:21,611
Oh, my god.

289
00:20:26,790 --> 00:20:27,790
Sorry.

290
00:20:40,887 --> 00:20:42,928
Looks like he suffered
a cerebral hemorrhage.

291
00:20:43,125 --> 00:20:44,997
Why did you do that? We needed him!

292
00:20:47,105 --> 00:20:48,764
They were never
gonna trade him for Jack.

293
00:20:48,765 --> 00:20:51,027
- You don't know that.
- You don't know it, either.

294
00:20:51,168 --> 00:20:54,036
What we do know
is that he shot one of his own people

295
00:20:54,094 --> 00:20:56,121
who didn't want to be
in this exact situation,

296
00:20:56,333 --> 00:20:59,021
- so I'm gonna stick with my opinion.
- We could have discussed it.

297
00:20:59,041 --> 00:21:01,825
Nobody asked me about it when
we brought him along in the 1st place.

298
00:21:01,826 --> 00:21:02,848
All right.

299
00:21:02,985 --> 00:21:08,394
Pardon me for not knowing
that they had a sonic weapon fence.

300
00:21:08,894 --> 00:21:11,215
I didn't know he was gonna die.
How would I know that?

301
00:21:11,648 --> 00:21:12,981
Why are you really here?

302
00:21:14,048 --> 00:21:15,270
Are you here for Jack?

303
00:21:16,658 --> 00:21:18,046
Why else would I be here?

304
00:21:19,883 --> 00:21:21,438
We'll talk about this later.

305
00:21:22,185 --> 00:21:23,185
Fine by me.

306
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:25,454
Just tell me
how we're gonna go through this.

307
00:21:25,493 --> 00:21:26,959
We're not gonna go through it.

308
00:21:27,011 --> 00:21:28,122
We're going over it.

309
00:21:30,271 --> 00:21:31,493
Sayid, where's the ax?

310
00:21:31,622 --> 00:21:32,622
It's in his pack.

311
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:34,171
No, wait a minute. I got it.

312
00:21:34,229 --> 00:21:35,229
Here, I got it.

313
00:21:46,901 --> 00:21:49,165
I thought
you didn't know there was any c-4.

314
00:21:50,552 --> 00:21:51,885
Well, I stand corrected.

315
00:21:53,102 --> 00:21:54,213
Why did you take it?

316
00:21:55,405 --> 00:21:57,996
You never know
when a little c-4 might come in handy.

317
00:21:59,362 --> 00:22:01,106
You'll have to do better than that.

318
00:22:11,675 --> 00:22:12,871
Okay, there you go.

319
00:22:15,031 --> 00:22:16,633
What's going on with you, Charlie?

320
00:22:17,494 --> 00:22:20,754
- I just put Aaron down
- No, you and Desmond,

321
00:22:20,893 --> 00:22:21,893
what's going on?

322
00:22:22,204 --> 00:22:24,733
- What you're talking about.
- So you don't know anything about

323
00:22:24,790 --> 00:22:27,086
Desmond shooting off his gun
and scaring away the birds?

324
00:22:28,255 --> 00:22:30,174
I've been with Aaron all morning.

325
00:22:30,207 --> 00:22:32,409
- You're lying to me, Charlie.
- I am not lying.

326
00:22:35,367 --> 00:22:37,641
What happened to the guy
who woke up this morning

327
00:22:37,851 --> 00:22:40,340
who wanted to go and have
a picnic and seize the day?

328
00:22:40,472 --> 00:22:42,360
You really want to know the truth?

329
00:22:43,578 --> 00:22:45,504
That glint you saw
could have been anything--

330
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:48,395
a piece of glass
stuck in the bird's foot...

331
00:22:48,584 --> 00:22:50,639
or it could have been nothing at all.

332
00:22:52,345 --> 00:22:55,456
I don't want to advocate false hope,
Claire, that's all.

333
00:22:57,446 --> 00:22:58,974
Well, I'm sorry

334
00:22:59,133 --> 00:23:02,341
I bothered you with my stupid ideas,
and, it won't ever happen again.

335
00:23:02,904 --> 00:23:05,169
And, Charlie,
I don't want my baby around lies.

336
00:23:05,296 --> 00:23:08,171
- I think you might be overreacting.
- Overreacting?

337
00:23:08,941 --> 00:23:11,962
No, I thought you were here for me,
that I could count on you.

338
00:23:12,392 --> 00:23:14,003
- I was wrong.
- No, Claire!

339
00:23:14,157 --> 00:23:16,892
I'm on my own,
and at least I know that now.

340
00:23:18,401 --> 00:23:19,616
Just go!

341
00:23:29,945 --> 00:23:30,945
Morning, dear.

342
00:23:31,247 --> 00:23:32,747
Oh, I like your new doctor.

343
00:23:33,248 --> 00:23:34,248
What new doctor?

344
00:23:34,402 --> 00:23:35,402
Oh, the American.

345
00:23:35,801 --> 00:23:37,245
He's in with your mum now.

346
00:23:52,075 --> 00:23:53,075
Excuse me.

347
00:24:01,528 --> 00:24:02,627
The nurse said...

348
00:24:04,805 --> 00:24:05,819
Are you a doctor?

349
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:09,030
Yes...

350
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:17,223
I'm very sorry. I shouldn't be...

351
00:24:17,842 --> 00:24:20,399
disturbing you. I was just leaving.

352
00:24:21,598 --> 00:24:23,094
What are you doing here?

353
00:24:23,954 --> 00:24:25,498
I was just on my way out, Lindsey.

354
00:24:25,647 --> 00:24:27,642
- If Carole knew you were here...
- She'd what?

355
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:31,612
What would she do?
She wouldn't be acting the way you are.

356
00:24:31,763 --> 00:24:33,043
Aunt Lindsey,

357
00:24:33,602 --> 00:24:35,426
what's going on here? Who is he?

358
00:24:37,369 --> 00:24:38,369
It doesn't matter.

359
00:24:38,924 --> 00:24:41,719
- Just go.
- Maybe you should tell her, Lindsey.

360
00:24:41,976 --> 00:24:44,829
- She deserves to know.
- Please, just leave us alone.

361
00:24:44,921 --> 00:24:47,198
You are not the arbiter here.

362
00:24:47,559 --> 00:24:49,738
- In these circumstances--
- You are taking advantage

363
00:24:49,739 --> 00:24:51,624
- of my sister's situation--
- I believe Claire

364
00:24:51,662 --> 00:24:53,459
- has every right to know--
- just stop it!

365
00:24:55,099 --> 00:24:57,038
Are you the one paying the bills?

366
00:24:57,407 --> 00:24:59,529
Are you the one taking care of all this?

367
00:25:03,212 --> 00:25:04,212
Yes.

368
00:25:11,451 --> 00:25:12,609
Then who are you?

369
00:25:19,466 --> 00:25:20,836
I'm your father, Claire.

370
00:25:56,122 --> 00:25:58,418
The system appears to fire a sonic pulse

371
00:25:58,888 --> 00:26:01,442
when an object
breaks the plane between two pylons.

372
00:26:01,558 --> 00:26:02,573
So...

373
00:26:03,652 --> 00:26:05,262
as long as we don't break the plane,

374
00:26:05,601 --> 00:26:07,045
we should remain unharmed.

375
00:26:07,152 --> 00:26:09,364
Why not just use
the plastic explosive you took?

376
00:26:09,456 --> 00:26:11,681
Be my guest.
You wanna go stick it on there?

377
00:26:12,303 --> 00:26:15,390
Whoever climbs over,
give those sensors a wide berth.

378
00:26:15,641 --> 00:26:16,857
I'll go first.

379
00:26:20,113 --> 00:26:21,212
Give me a hand.

380
00:27:21,514 --> 00:27:22,680
I guess I'll go next.

381
00:27:58,994 --> 00:28:00,093
Here you go.

382
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:01,920
Thanks.

383
00:28:05,630 --> 00:28:07,395
You have every right to be upset.

384
00:28:07,482 --> 00:28:09,204
It just doesn't make any sense.

385
00:28:09,933 --> 00:28:12,210
Desmond's never gone
boar hunting before,

386
00:28:12,287 --> 00:28:14,308
and the boar
never come that close to the beach.

387
00:28:14,386 --> 00:28:16,622
Well, whatever is going on,

388
00:28:17,004 --> 00:28:18,788
they're still talking about it.

389
00:28:24,426 --> 00:28:25,426
Can you watch him?

390
00:28:26,130 --> 00:28:27,378
What are you going to do?

391
00:28:30,084 --> 00:28:31,084
Get some answers.

392
00:28:38,248 --> 00:28:39,692
I'll be with you in a sec.

393
00:28:44,436 --> 00:28:45,555
There you go.

394
00:28:46,629 --> 00:28:47,629
It'll be 10 bucks.

395
00:28:59,597 --> 00:29:00,930
What are you doing here?

396
00:29:01,554 --> 00:29:02,887
Buy you a cup of coffee?

397
00:29:06,710 --> 00:29:08,082
I have nothing to say to you.

398
00:29:09,066 --> 00:29:11,573
I'm leaving tonight,
then I'll be out of your life forever.

399
00:29:11,631 --> 00:29:14,081
Just one cup of coffee.

400
00:29:22,807 --> 00:29:23,945
So it's true.

401
00:29:26,128 --> 00:29:28,057
Yes, it's true.

402
00:29:34,846 --> 00:29:36,750
How'd you find out about the accident?

403
00:29:37,153 --> 00:29:39,123
A doctor friend here in Sydney told me.

404
00:29:39,201 --> 00:29:41,849
I got the call the minute your mother
went into surgery.

405
00:29:45,865 --> 00:29:47,799
Why did she tell me that you're dead?

406
00:29:49,825 --> 00:29:51,325
Well, because I--no doubt--

407
00:29:51,774 --> 00:29:54,166
left her
with so many wonderful memories.

408
00:29:57,379 --> 00:29:59,467
Look, we had a fling.

409
00:30:00,232 --> 00:30:02,575
I was back in Los Angeles
when she told me

410
00:30:02,721 --> 00:30:05,004
that she was pregnant,
that she was going to have the baby...

411
00:30:05,053 --> 00:30:06,644
- have you.
- You didn't--

412
00:30:07,454 --> 00:30:08,791
You didn't want to see me?

413
00:30:09,313 --> 00:30:11,985
No. I came out a bunch of times
when you were little.

414
00:30:13,201 --> 00:30:14,411
I stayed over,

415
00:30:15,588 --> 00:30:16,707
gave you toys.

416
00:30:17,508 --> 00:30:18,625
I sang to you.

417
00:30:21,826 --> 00:30:23,022
Why'd you stop coming?

418
00:30:25,521 --> 00:30:27,034
'cause your aunt hates me,

419
00:30:27,690 --> 00:30:29,957
and your mother
didn't like the fact that I,

420
00:30:30,378 --> 00:30:31,544
I had another family.

421
00:30:32,882 --> 00:30:35,091
Why are you here now, then?
Why'd you come?

422
00:30:35,168 --> 00:30:37,580
You could've just paid her bills
from the states.

423
00:30:37,638 --> 00:30:40,421
I came over because I wanted to help.

424
00:30:40,843 --> 00:30:41,843
Help with what?

425
00:30:44,570 --> 00:30:46,171
Your mother is alive...

426
00:30:49,056 --> 00:30:50,611
but she's not really living.

427
00:30:51,508 --> 00:30:52,773
What that's supposed to mean?

428
00:30:52,806 --> 00:30:55,362
It means that now may be the time

429
00:30:55,713 --> 00:30:59,167
to look at other alternatives,
other ways to relieve her pain.

430
00:30:59,923 --> 00:31:02,660
Now it is illegal
to turn off her machines,

431
00:31:02,723 --> 00:31:05,760
but I know of ways
that can achieve the same effect

432
00:31:05,832 --> 00:31:07,816
- without the legal consequences.
- Just stop it!

433
00:31:07,874 --> 00:31:10,163
- So...
You didn't come here to help me.

434
00:31:10,784 --> 00:31:13,356
You came here to try and fix
a mistake that you made.

435
00:31:13,371 --> 00:31:14,439
No, honey, that's not true.

436
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:17,300
You think that just paying her bills
makes you noble or something?

437
00:31:18,697 --> 00:31:19,971
You come down here,

438
00:31:20,511 --> 00:31:22,076
and you try and get me to kill her?

439
00:31:26,707 --> 00:31:27,882
You know, just go.

440
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:31,014
Why don't you just go?
Go back to your real family.

441
00:31:35,042 --> 00:31:36,161
You know...

442
00:31:38,307 --> 00:31:39,792
You might be my father...

443
00:31:42,846 --> 00:31:44,428
But I don't even know your name...

444
00:31:47,001 --> 00:31:49,850
And I, um, I want it to stay that way.

445
00:31:53,812 --> 00:31:54,911
Listen to me.

446
00:31:56,214 --> 00:31:59,350
Do not keep your mother alive
for the wrong reasons.

447
00:31:59,678 --> 00:32:02,538
Now there is hope and there is guilt,
and believe me,

448
00:32:03,496 --> 00:32:05,131
I know the difference.

449
00:32:13,588 --> 00:32:14,588
Good-bye, kiddo.

450
00:32:15,692 --> 00:32:17,247
It's great seeing you again.

451
00:32:59,818 --> 00:33:01,573
What the hell are you doing?

452
00:33:02,622 --> 00:33:03,622
You followed me.

453
00:33:06,476 --> 00:33:07,920
Stay back!

454
00:33:08,479 --> 00:33:09,701
It's one of the birds.

455
00:33:09,881 --> 00:33:10,881
Stay back!

456
00:33:29,816 --> 00:33:31,816
How did you know it was gonna be here?

457
00:33:31,911 --> 00:33:32,911
I didn't.

458
00:33:33,365 --> 00:33:34,365
Yes, you did.

459
00:33:34,917 --> 00:33:35,917
You had to.

460
00:33:36,668 --> 00:33:39,279
That's what you and Charlie
were arguing about.

461
00:33:41,176 --> 00:33:42,176
You knew.

462
00:33:43,933 --> 00:33:45,293
- How would I?
- I don't know,

463
00:33:45,331 --> 00:33:47,280
but you know,
you walked straight here...

464
00:33:48,187 --> 00:33:50,539
no doubt at all
about where you were going.

465
00:33:50,590 --> 00:33:53,657
You came right to this beach
and right to this rock,

466
00:33:54,641 --> 00:33:56,686
and low and behold, there's the bird.

467
00:33:58,252 --> 00:34:00,085
What t hell is going on, Desmond?

468
00:34:08,568 --> 00:34:09,956
See that spot over there?

469
00:34:14,928 --> 00:34:17,205
That's where Charlie slipped
and fell in.

470
00:34:18,547 --> 00:34:21,094
He got pounded again and again
by the rocks and...

471
00:34:22,435 --> 00:34:23,435
broke his neck.

472
00:34:24,941 --> 00:34:25,941
What?

473
00:34:26,643 --> 00:34:28,385
What--what are you talking about?

474
00:34:30,148 --> 00:34:31,592
That's where Charlie died.

475
00:34:45,409 --> 00:34:46,742
Look what Desmond found.

476
00:34:47,906 --> 00:34:48,906
How about that?

477
00:34:50,564 --> 00:34:51,619
It does have a tag.

478
00:34:52,366 --> 00:34:53,366
You were right.

479
00:34:58,973 --> 00:35:00,524
Desmond told me everything

480
00:35:04,286 --> 00:35:05,675
about all his visions...

481
00:35:07,686 --> 00:35:10,408
That he knew you were gonna get hit
by lightning,

482
00:35:13,515 --> 00:35:16,621
that you were gonna drown
trying to rescue me in the ocean...

483
00:35:22,106 --> 00:35:24,328
how you died trying to get me this bird.

484
00:35:25,511 --> 00:35:27,216
You don't believe all that, do you?

485
00:35:52,510 --> 00:35:54,318
Now who turned the telly off?

486
00:35:54,885 --> 00:35:57,625
Don't they know how much
you love your nature shows?

487
00:36:00,631 --> 00:36:01,631
That's better.

488
00:36:05,435 --> 00:36:06,879
So how are you today, mum?

489
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:09,940
Did you have an okay night?

490
00:36:28,170 --> 00:36:29,745
Something I have to tell you,

491
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:32,822
something I should have told you
a long time ago.

492
00:36:41,286 --> 00:36:42,286
I'm pregnant.

493
00:36:49,848 --> 00:36:51,334
I'm giving it away.

494
00:36:54,107 --> 00:36:55,812
It's for the best.

495
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:04,119
I wish...

496
00:37:10,622 --> 00:37:12,142
I don't know how you did it--

497
00:37:13,807 --> 00:37:15,196
raising me alone.

498
00:37:16,837 --> 00:37:18,392
That must have been so hard,

499
00:37:20,837 --> 00:37:21,976
and I was just...

500
00:37:23,059 --> 00:37:24,059
awful...

501
00:37:29,876 --> 00:37:31,021
So horrible to you.

502
00:37:37,426 --> 00:37:38,810
I'm so sorry, mum.

503
00:37:49,551 --> 00:37:53,198
So sorry for all the awful things
I said to you in the car...

504
00:37:56,154 --> 00:37:57,010
That...

505
00:37:58,691 --> 00:37:59,780
I hated you...

506
00:38:03,222 --> 00:38:05,074
and that I wished
you weren't my mother...

507
00:38:05,913 --> 00:38:07,842
and that I wished you were dead.

508
00:38:09,905 --> 00:38:11,333
It's all my fault--

509
00:38:12,490 --> 00:38:13,831
the accident,

510
00:38:14,550 --> 00:38:15,738
everything.

511
00:38:22,402 --> 00:38:24,062
I'm so sorry, mom.

512
00:38:37,966 --> 00:38:39,462
I'll see you soon, okay?

513
00:38:42,009 --> 00:38:43,764
"To whom it may concern,

514
00:38:44,076 --> 00:38:47,483
"we are survivors of Oceanic flight 815.

515
00:38:49,962 --> 00:38:52,687
"We have survived
on this island
for 80 days.

516
00:38:54,890 --> 00:38:56,291
"We were six hours into the flight

517
00:38:56,346 --> 00:38:58,006
"when the pilot said we were off course

518
00:38:58,044 --> 00:38:59,954
"and turned back towards Fiji.

519
00:39:02,603 --> 00:39:04,197
"We hit turbulence and crashed.

520
00:39:05,922 --> 00:39:08,356
"We've been waiting here all this time--

521
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:11,579
"waiting for rescue that has not come.

522
00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:16,568
"We do not know where we are.
We only know you have not found us.

523
00:39:18,702 --> 00:39:21,217
"We've done our best
to live on this island.

524
00:39:21,429 --> 00:39:24,429
"Some of us have come
to accept we may never leave it.

525
00:39:27,449 --> 00:39:30,088
"Not all of us have survived
since the crash,

526
00:39:31,444 --> 00:39:33,374
"but there is new life, too,

527
00:39:34,030 --> 00:39:36,152
"and with it, there is hope.

528
00:39:37,101 --> 00:39:38,534
"We are alive.

529
00:39:41,941 --> 00:39:43,714
