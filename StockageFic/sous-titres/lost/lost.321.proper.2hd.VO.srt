2
00:00:02,224 --> 00:00:03,847
Desmond said I was gonna die.

3
00:00:03,969 --> 00:00:06,624
He told me he has
these flashes... visions.

4
00:00:06,774 --> 00:00:09,861
When I saw the lightning hit the roof,
you were electrocuted.

5
00:00:09,983 --> 00:00:11,748
And when you heard
Claire was in the water,

6
00:00:11,778 --> 00:00:14,703
you drowned trying to save her.
I dove in myself, so you never went in.

7
00:00:14,825 --> 00:00:16,349
No matter what I try to do,

8
00:00:16,485 --> 00:00:17,902
you're gonna die, Charlie.

9
00:00:18,024 --> 00:00:19,378
There's a woman in Hurley's tent

10
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:21,368
who parachuted
onto the island yesterday.

11
00:00:21,490 --> 00:00:24,458
She says that the boat she took off from
is about 80 miles off the coast,

12
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:27,550
and if she can find a way to contact it,
we'll all be rescued.

13
00:00:27,672 --> 00:00:28,978
Why didn't anyone tell me this?

14
00:00:29,182 --> 00:00:30,669
Because they don't trust you.

15
00:00:31,024 --> 00:00:32,109
<i>Kwon is pregnant.</i>

16
00:00:32,264 --> 00:00:33,264
Where'd you get that?

17
00:00:33,377 --> 00:00:35,711
You really think
you're in a position to ask questions?

18
00:00:35,735 --> 00:00:37,753
I told Jack what they were making me do.

19
00:00:37,922 --> 00:00:39,199
Why didn't you tell us?

20
00:00:39,422 --> 00:00:41,799
Because I hadn't decided
what to do about it yet.

21
00:01:17,711 --> 00:01:19,123
Anyone wants to venture a guess

22
00:01:19,248 --> 00:01:22,086
as to what Jack's gonna be showing us
out in the middle of nowhere?

23
00:01:22,397 --> 00:01:23,877
I don't know. Stuff.

24
00:01:25,022 --> 00:01:26,244
Probably secret stuff.

25
00:01:27,203 --> 00:01:29,150
Why does everything
have to be such a secret?

26
00:01:29,272 --> 00:01:31,133
How about some openness
for a change?

27
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:33,842
We kept the parachute lady secret.

28
00:01:33,964 --> 00:01:35,130
Ah, that's different.

29
00:01:35,275 --> 00:01:36,275
Different how?

30
00:01:36,773 --> 00:01:39,566
Well, because we weren't out there
playing football with them.

31
00:01:39,964 --> 00:01:40,964
What?

32
00:01:42,297 --> 00:01:43,336
Nothing.

33
00:01:43,462 --> 00:01:44,462
Wait.

34
00:01:46,069 --> 00:01:48,011
You had one of your flashes
again, didn't you?

35
00:01:48,774 --> 00:01:49,996
No, Charlie, I didn't.

36
00:01:53,647 --> 00:01:54,647
We're here.

37
00:02:07,149 --> 00:02:08,446
A couple of nights ago,

38
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:11,447
Juliet came to me,
and she told me everything...

39
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:15,757
That Ben had sent her here to find out
which of our women were pregnant.

40
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:17,621
So what, you guys
were doing tests on us?

41
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:20,066
No, but that's what he wanted me to do.

42
00:02:20,847 --> 00:02:23,849
I've been leaving tapes
at the medical station.

43
00:02:24,497 --> 00:02:25,848
You all heard what he said.

44
00:02:25,974 --> 00:02:27,307
They're coming tomorrow.

45
00:02:28,735 --> 00:02:31,461
Sun, I'm sorry that I lied to you.

46
00:02:32,662 --> 00:02:34,427
While I appreciate your honesty, Jack,

47
00:02:34,849 --> 00:02:37,034
it doesn't explain
why you brought us out here.

48
00:02:51,224 --> 00:02:52,224
Show 'em.

49
00:03:13,973 --> 00:03:15,999
When Juliet told me they where coming,

50
00:03:16,975 --> 00:03:18,560
the first thing I thought was,

51
00:03:19,388 --> 00:03:21,307
where the hell
are we gonna hide this time?

52
00:03:21,988 --> 00:03:23,317
But hiding's pointless.

53
00:03:23,535 --> 00:03:25,347
They're just gonna keep coming back.

54
00:03:26,348 --> 00:03:28,209
So I went out, and I found some help.

55
00:03:29,292 --> 00:03:30,339
And for the past few days,

56
00:03:30,461 --> 00:03:32,760
she's been bringing dynamite
back from "the black rock."

57
00:03:33,453 --> 00:03:34,489
For the very first time,

58
00:03:34,611 --> 00:03:37,756
we know exactly what they want,
when they're coming to get it,

59
00:03:37,909 --> 00:03:39,729
and they have no idea

60
00:03:40,867 --> 00:03:42,388
that we're gonna be waiting for 'em.

61
00:03:44,428 --> 00:03:46,859
So Juliet's gonna mark the tents
with the white rocks,

62
00:03:46,981 --> 00:03:48,173
just like she was told to,

63
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:52,003
but there's not gonna be
any pregnant women inside.

64
00:03:52,125 --> 00:03:54,341
There's gonna be plenty
of what we used on that tree.

65
00:03:55,602 --> 00:03:56,788
So tomorrow night...

66
00:03:58,178 --> 00:03:59,178
We stop hiding.

67
00:03:59,617 --> 00:04:00,662
We stop running.

68
00:04:00,784 --> 00:04:03,895
We stop living in fear of them,
because when they show up...

69
00:04:07,177 --> 00:04:09,010
we're gonna blow 'em all to hell.

70
00:04:10,361 --> 00:04:22,332
Subtitles: swsub.com

71
00:04:31,258 --> 00:04:32,258
Bloody hell!

72
00:04:32,819 --> 00:04:34,322
Why are we even doing this?

73
00:04:34,444 --> 00:04:35,444
Chin up, mate.

74
00:04:35,725 --> 00:04:37,508
- We're headlining.
- Headlining?

75
00:04:37,991 --> 00:04:39,342
We're playing Clitheroe...

76
00:04:39,569 --> 00:04:40,823
The arse end of nowhere.

77
00:04:40,945 --> 00:04:41,945
A gig's a gig.

78
00:04:42,322 --> 00:04:43,556
We're building our fan base.

79
00:04:43,698 --> 00:04:46,134
Will our fan base pay
for a new sodding tire?

80
00:04:46,448 --> 00:04:47,686
Only if we show up.

81
00:04:48,603 --> 00:04:50,601
So let's just get on with it, shall we?

82
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:52,679
You know what, Liam?

83
00:04:52,841 --> 00:04:53,999
You get on with it.

84
00:04:54,195 --> 00:04:55,195
I quit.

85
00:04:55,633 --> 00:04:57,992
- You're giving up?
- There's nothing to give up on!

86
00:04:58,383 --> 00:05:01,380
We're broke! The album's not selling!
We're a bloody joke!

87
00:05:01,502 --> 00:05:02,569
Hey, shut it!

88
00:05:03,821 --> 00:05:04,821
Listen.

89
00:05:09,954 --> 00:05:11,055
That's us.

90
00:05:14,499 --> 00:05:15,657
We're on the radio!

91
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,388
That we are.

92
00:05:20,547 --> 00:05:22,300
We're on the bloody radio!

93
00:05:27,816 --> 00:05:29,227
I told you, baby brother!

94
00:05:29,349 --> 00:05:30,995
We're gonna be bloody rock stars.

95
00:05:38,346 --> 00:05:39,493
Can I ask you something?

96
00:05:43,049 --> 00:05:45,066
Who are you people
about to go to war with?

97
00:05:46,018 --> 00:05:47,366
Oh, that's a long story.

98
00:05:47,488 --> 00:05:48,974
Want to ask me something else?

99
00:05:49,757 --> 00:05:50,824
You having a laugh?

100
00:05:51,628 --> 00:05:52,735
Of course not.

101
00:05:53,042 --> 00:05:55,063
I'd never disrespect a fellow Mancunian.

102
00:05:56,018 --> 00:05:58,164
- You're from Manchester, then?
- I am.

103
00:05:58,364 --> 00:06:01,223
My band got its start at
the night and day bar on Oldham street.

104
00:06:01,791 --> 00:06:03,866
- What band?
- We were called Drive Shaft.

105
00:06:04,985 --> 00:06:06,262
Yeah. Yeah, I know you.

106
00:06:06,585 --> 00:06:08,386
We had our moment in the sun.

107
00:06:08,508 --> 00:06:09,916
No, not that... the crash.

108
00:06:10,297 --> 00:06:11,581
You're the dead rock star.

109
00:06:11,729 --> 00:06:14,113
They made a big deal out of you
when they found the plane.

110
00:06:14,421 --> 00:06:16,274
Huge memorial service, new album.

111
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:17,461
There's a new album?

112
00:06:17,583 --> 00:06:19,354
Yeah. God, it was everywhere...

113
00:06:19,527 --> 00:06:20,866
A "greatest hits" thing.

114
00:06:26,677 --> 00:06:28,498
Hey, look on the bright side.

115
00:06:28,928 --> 00:06:30,483
You're not really dead, right?

116
00:06:32,364 --> 00:06:33,364
Yeah, right.

117
00:06:57,463 --> 00:06:58,631
We need more wire,

118
00:06:59,523 --> 00:07:01,609
so we can trigger these
from a safe distance.

119
00:07:01,731 --> 00:07:03,947
I can get people to start
stripping the plane wreckage.

120
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:06,818
Good. I should be able
to finish rigging these tents

121
00:07:06,978 --> 00:07:08,227
in the next 24 hours.

122
00:07:08,743 --> 00:07:10,435
We'll be ready by tomorrow night.

123
00:07:16,395 --> 00:07:17,967
We need to talk about Naomi's phone.

124
00:07:18,089 --> 00:07:19,859
- Not now.
- If you're angry I doubted you,

125
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:22,005
I'd be happy to make
a sincere apology later,

126
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:24,894
- but now we have a means...
- Look, I'm a little bit busy right now.

127
00:07:25,016 --> 00:07:27,377
And I am trying to get us
off this island!

128
00:07:31,373 --> 00:07:32,772
I can't transmit using this phone

129
00:07:32,894 --> 00:07:35,675
because Danielle's distress signal
is overriding the frequency.

130
00:07:36,982 --> 00:07:38,678
If you tell me where the radio tower is,

131
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,293
I can go there, switch off
your message and call for help.

132
00:07:41,429 --> 00:07:43,883
My signal has been playing
for the last 16 years,

133
00:07:44,005 --> 00:07:45,151
and nobody has heard it.

134
00:07:45,299 --> 00:07:47,054
Why do you think
you'll have better luck?

135
00:07:47,176 --> 00:07:50,501
Naomi's boat is only 80 miles offshore.

136
00:07:51,472 --> 00:07:53,883
I know if we eliminate
Danielle's signal, they'll hear us.

137
00:07:53,928 --> 00:07:54,990
No, they won't.

138
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:56,800
And why is that?

139
00:07:57,888 --> 00:07:58,932
We're jamming it.

140
00:07:59,358 --> 00:08:00,358
What?

141
00:08:00,436 --> 00:08:02,110
Ben is using one of the Dharma stations

142
00:08:02,135 --> 00:08:04,649
to block all of the signals off
of the island except for ours.

143
00:08:04,675 --> 00:08:05,675
What station?

144
00:08:06,051 --> 00:08:07,654
They call it the "Looking Glass."

145
00:08:08,452 --> 00:08:09,786
- The looking glass?
- Yes.

146
00:08:09,908 --> 00:08:12,063
But it's underwater.
I have no idea where it is.

147
00:08:14,425 --> 00:08:15,425
I believe I do.

148
00:08:17,614 --> 00:08:19,554
Look, I know...
I know Jack thinks it's best,

149
00:08:19,676 --> 00:08:22,170
but, you know, what if
they're coming for him again?

150
00:08:24,676 --> 00:08:25,842
Claire, listen to me.

151
00:08:26,675 --> 00:08:27,897
I'm gonna protect you.

152
00:08:28,427 --> 00:08:29,883
I'm gonna protect Aaron.

153
00:08:31,319 --> 00:08:32,426
I promise.

154
00:08:33,310 --> 00:08:35,315
Look, everything is gonna be fine.

155
00:08:40,398 --> 00:08:41,409
Sorry.

156
00:08:43,626 --> 00:08:45,245
Can you give me a hand with something?

157
00:08:47,753 --> 00:08:48,809
Of course.

158
00:09:01,788 --> 00:09:04,172
So you ready to tell me
what you saw this morning?

159
00:09:04,987 --> 00:09:05,987
Aye.

160
00:09:07,238 --> 00:09:09,531
Right. So how does it happen this time?

161
00:09:13,489 --> 00:09:14,489
Come on, Des!

162
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,564
You can tell me. I can take it.

163
00:09:21,728 --> 00:09:23,228
What I saw, Charlie, was...

164
00:09:24,851 --> 00:09:27,030
Claire and her baby
getting into a helicopter...

165
00:09:28,166 --> 00:09:29,277
A helicopter that...

166
00:09:30,978 --> 00:09:33,590
That lifts off, leaves this island.

167
00:09:39,851 --> 00:09:40,851
You sure?

168
00:09:41,417 --> 00:09:42,417
Aye.

169
00:09:42,917 --> 00:09:44,028
Rescue helicopter...

170
00:09:44,601 --> 00:09:45,601
On this beach?

171
00:09:45,915 --> 00:09:47,407
This island? That's what you saw?

172
00:09:49,851 --> 00:09:51,462
We're getting bloody rescued!

173
00:09:52,018 --> 00:09:54,391
I thought you were gonna tell me
I was gonna die again.

174
00:09:59,789 --> 00:10:00,789
You are, Charlie.

175
00:10:03,130 --> 00:10:04,351
Wait. What?

176
00:10:05,981 --> 00:10:07,100
If you don't...

177
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:09,549
none of it will happen.

178
00:10:11,571 --> 00:10:13,015
There won't be any rescue.

179
00:10:16,507 --> 00:10:17,608
I'm sorry, brother...

180
00:10:18,866 --> 00:10:19,878
but this time...

181
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:24,597
This time you have to die.

182
00:10:33,547 --> 00:10:34,603
Come on!

183
00:10:39,096 --> 00:10:41,242
Come on, Charlie. Jump in!

184
00:10:41,901 --> 00:10:43,234
I'm gonna catch you, boy.

185
00:10:44,337 --> 00:10:46,416
No. You're just going to back away.

186
00:10:46,622 --> 00:10:48,310
Don't be daft. Jump in!

187
00:10:51,130 --> 00:10:53,457
I promise, Charlie. I'm gonna catch you.

188
00:10:53,747 --> 00:10:54,786
No, he won't!

189
00:10:55,498 --> 00:10:56,498
Zip it, you.

190
00:10:57,984 --> 00:10:59,709
Look, don't listen to your brother.

191
00:11:00,122 --> 00:11:01,184
Just jump on in.

192
00:11:04,184 --> 00:11:06,330
There's nothing to be afraid of,
Charlie.

193
00:11:07,873 --> 00:11:10,049
I'll catch you. I promise.

194
00:11:33,337 --> 00:11:34,433
I did it!

195
00:11:35,899 --> 00:11:36,958
You got it!

196
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:39,651
- I did it.
- You're swimming, Charlie.

197
00:11:48,274 --> 00:11:49,353
What you writing?

198
00:11:57,307 --> 00:11:58,307
Nothing.

199
00:12:06,057 --> 00:12:07,112
All right, tell me.

200
00:12:10,244 --> 00:12:11,910
Are you sure you want to know?

201
00:12:14,023 --> 00:12:15,881
I mean, it might be easier
if you just...

202
00:12:17,532 --> 00:12:18,724
I want to know.

203
00:12:22,615 --> 00:12:23,841
You're inside a hatch.

204
00:12:24,173 --> 00:12:25,275
It's...

205
00:12:26,763 --> 00:12:28,151
a room full of equipment.

206
00:12:29,202 --> 00:12:30,766
There's a blinking yellow light

207
00:12:31,095 --> 00:12:32,471
above a switch.

208
00:12:33,165 --> 00:12:34,374
You flip the switch.

209
00:12:36,641 --> 00:12:37,641
Light goes off.

210
00:12:43,756 --> 00:12:44,880
And then you drown.

211
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:57,640
When?

212
00:13:01,082 --> 00:13:02,201
I don't know.

213
00:13:02,575 --> 00:13:05,036
You're sure you saw Claire and Aaron
get on that helicopter?

214
00:13:05,326 --> 00:13:06,326
Aye.

215
00:13:09,078 --> 00:13:10,078
So...

216
00:13:12,325 --> 00:13:14,282
before I... drown...

217
00:13:16,376 --> 00:13:17,897
I just have to flip a switch?

218
00:13:20,042 --> 00:13:21,086
That's right.

219
00:13:25,765 --> 00:13:26,765
Where is it, then?

220
00:13:31,127 --> 00:13:32,806
Now this is the Looking Glass.

221
00:13:33,451 --> 00:13:35,025
It's an underwater Dharma station.

222
00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:38,451
Please, can you tell me anything
you might know about this place?

223
00:13:38,646 --> 00:13:39,996
I've never been down there.

224
00:13:40,309 --> 00:13:41,762
I don't know anyone who has.

225
00:13:42,450 --> 00:13:43,450
Why not?

226
00:13:44,033 --> 00:13:45,486
There was some accident.

227
00:13:45,999 --> 00:13:48,323
Ben told us that the station
was completely flooded.

228
00:13:48,456 --> 00:13:50,506
Well, if it's flooded,
then how does it still work?

229
00:13:50,648 --> 00:13:52,158
How it still works is irrelevant.

230
00:13:52,325 --> 00:13:54,605
The question is, how do
we get it to stop working,

231
00:13:54,765 --> 00:13:56,463
so we could use the satellite phone?

232
00:13:59,125 --> 00:14:00,973
The diagram shows
that the looking glass

233
00:14:01,123 --> 00:14:02,986
is connected to the island by a cable.

234
00:14:03,764 --> 00:14:05,619
I feel sure that this is
the very same cable

235
00:14:05,764 --> 00:14:07,805
down the beach
which runs into the ocean.

236
00:14:08,254 --> 00:14:10,916
So if we follow the cable,
it should lead us to the station.

237
00:14:11,167 --> 00:14:12,723
So how are we gonna get in?

238
00:14:12,935 --> 00:14:14,024
We swim in.

239
00:14:14,313 --> 00:14:15,505
There's a moon pool...

240
00:14:16,722 --> 00:14:19,050
A room with an open floor
at the base of the station...

241
00:14:19,259 --> 00:14:21,189
Big enough
for a submarine to dock.

242
00:14:21,471 --> 00:14:23,038
Even if the station's flooded,

243
00:14:23,678 --> 00:14:26,164
I think I'll be able to find
the relay switch and disable it.

244
00:14:26,313 --> 00:14:27,899
What about swimming back out?

245
00:14:31,183 --> 00:14:33,274
No. I'm not letting you
go on some suicide mission

246
00:14:33,453 --> 00:14:34,650
just to flip the switch.

247
00:14:34,773 --> 00:14:37,101
Someone has to do it,
or we'll never leave this island.

248
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:38,279
I'll do it.

249
00:14:38,784 --> 00:14:41,225
I can swim down, turn off that
bloody switch, swim back up.

250
00:14:41,293 --> 00:14:42,304
Piece of cake.

251
00:14:42,341 --> 00:14:44,543
Charlie, you don't even know
what we're talking about.

252
00:14:44,634 --> 00:14:46,814
I was junior swim champion
in northern England.

253
00:14:46,939 --> 00:14:48,340
I can hold my breath for 4 minutes.

254
00:14:48,408 --> 00:14:50,190
I know exactly what
you're talking about.

255
00:14:54,938 --> 00:14:57,061
No, and there's no reason
to do this now.

256
00:14:57,118 --> 00:14:59,661
We're gonna focus on the others,
and then we'll deal with this.

257
00:14:59,706 --> 00:15:02,063
Wait a minute.
We have a chance to signal for a rescue.

258
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:05,759
Look, for 90 days, I've been asked
to make decisions for this entire camp.

259
00:15:06,447 --> 00:15:08,104
There you go.
I just made one.

260
00:15:17,709 --> 00:15:19,276
Rose, that's a sailor's hitch.

261
00:15:19,843 --> 00:15:22,547
It's not gonna hold.
You wanna do a sheet bend like mine.

262
00:15:22,649 --> 00:15:24,284
Oh, so now you're a knot expert.

263
00:15:24,964 --> 00:15:26,299
Well, trust me, it's...

264
00:15:31,413 --> 00:15:32,514
How did you do that?

265
00:15:33,445 --> 00:15:34,853
Watch and learn, dear.

266
00:16:40,869 --> 00:16:42,318
Look there!
Look!

267
00:16:59,144 --> 00:17:00,513
Get off him, damn it!
It's okay.

268
00:17:00,558 --> 00:17:03,506
- What? He's one of them!
- I know! It's okay.

269
00:17:05,315 --> 00:17:06,711
He was in the cage next to me.

270
00:17:07,586 --> 00:17:08,778
I know this guy.

271
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:11,047
What the hell are you doing here, Karl?

272
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:13,346
They're... coming...

273
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:15,322
My people.

274
00:17:15,390 --> 00:17:17,947
Sorry you came all this way for nothing,
but we already know.

275
00:17:18,083 --> 00:17:19,312
Then why are you still here?

276
00:17:19,358 --> 00:17:22,268
'cause when they'll show up tomorrow
night, we're gonna be ready for 'em.

277
00:17:22,269 --> 00:17:25,320
Tomorrow? No, no,
they're coming tonight.

278
00:17:32,258 --> 00:17:33,718
They're coming right now!

279
00:17:43,685 --> 00:17:47,451
SIX HOURS AGO (del vo)

280
00:17:51,850 --> 00:17:53,072
When did you get back?

281
00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:54,355
Just now.

282
00:17:56,602 --> 00:17:57,602
Where's Locke?

283
00:18:00,623 --> 00:18:01,815
Here's your gun back.

284
00:18:07,217 --> 00:18:08,238
Ben, what's going on?

285
00:18:08,291 --> 00:18:09,291
Where's Ryan?

286
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:11,144
He's in his tent. Are you...

287
00:18:11,212 --> 00:18:12,540
It's time to get them.

288
00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:15,204
But you said tomorrow.

289
00:18:15,415 --> 00:18:17,026
Jacob wants it to happen now.

290
00:18:17,910 --> 00:18:19,198
Look, what happened out there?

291
00:18:19,228 --> 00:18:21,002
- Did john see...
- John had an accident.

292
00:18:23,853 --> 00:18:24,853
Ryan?

293
00:18:24,977 --> 00:18:25,977
Yes, sir?

294
00:18:26,384 --> 00:18:27,479
If you leave right now,

295
00:18:27,536 --> 00:18:29,455
how long will it take you
to reach their camp?

296
00:18:29,952 --> 00:18:32,778
Well, if I take my ten best,
we could set up to hit 'em by nightfall.

297
00:18:32,869 --> 00:18:34,945
- Then you better get going.
- No, Ben, wait.

298
00:18:35,115 --> 00:18:36,199
Moving up the schedule...

299
00:18:36,268 --> 00:18:38,481
Juliet may not be ready.
What if she hasn't had time...

300
00:18:38,538 --> 00:18:40,241
Then we'll take all their women...

301
00:18:41,968 --> 00:18:43,864
And we'll sort out
the ones we need later.

302
00:18:44,467 --> 00:18:45,523
And the men?

303
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:48,138
If any of 'em are stupid enough
to get in your way,

304
00:18:48,789 --> 00:18:49,789
kill 'em.

305
00:18:50,775 --> 00:18:51,785
All right.

306
00:19:04,186 --> 00:19:05,242
Karl!

307
00:19:07,790 --> 00:19:08,790
It's me!

308
00:19:12,093 --> 00:19:13,478
I thought you were bringing rabbit.

309
00:19:13,524 --> 00:19:15,567
You have to go... now.

310
00:19:15,976 --> 00:19:17,963
What? Did he find out I was out here?

311
00:19:18,167 --> 00:19:20,542
No, but he's sending Pryce
to their beach camp right now,

312
00:19:20,665 --> 00:19:21,761
and you have to warn them.

313
00:19:21,811 --> 00:19:23,192
- Warn them?
- You have to go now!

314
00:19:23,242 --> 00:19:25,455
I thought they were just gonna
take the pregnant women.

315
00:19:25,485 --> 00:19:26,511
If you take the outrigger,

316
00:19:26,533 --> 00:19:28,209
you'll get there
a few hours before them.

317
00:19:28,564 --> 00:19:30,916
- Wait, Alex...
- He's gonna kill them Karl!

318
00:19:34,852 --> 00:19:36,629
Austen and Ford saved your life.

319
00:19:40,541 --> 00:19:41,541
You owe them.

320
00:19:45,545 --> 00:19:46,703
You better take this.

321
00:19:49,865 --> 00:19:52,113
If I get caught, your father's
gonna kill me this time.

322
00:19:52,353 --> 00:19:53,392
Is he my father?

323
00:20:03,026 --> 00:20:04,168
Now go.

324
00:20:30,275 --> 00:20:31,478
Is that everything?

325
00:20:34,705 --> 00:20:35,801
Can we trust him?

326
00:20:36,121 --> 00:20:37,188
You don't trust me?

327
00:20:37,393 --> 00:20:38,393
What about her?

328
00:20:38,891 --> 00:20:39,976
She's a spy.

329
00:20:41,173 --> 00:20:44,341
She's supposed to mark the tents
of the pregnant women with white rocks

330
00:20:44,463 --> 00:20:46,968
- so they can take them.
- They know, Karl, but thanks.

331
00:20:48,907 --> 00:20:51,348
- So what are we gonna do?
- We have to leave now... Hide.

332
00:20:51,703 --> 00:20:54,523
Where? It's their island.
f they wanna kill us, they'll find us.

333
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,614
The sun's gonna go down in a few hours.

334
00:20:59,233 --> 00:21:01,390
- Do we have enough wire yet?
- Not even close.

335
00:21:01,855 --> 00:21:04,168
We have to find out another way
to set the dynamite off.

336
00:21:04,290 --> 00:21:06,081
- We can shoot.
- We don't have enough guns.

337
00:21:06,203 --> 00:21:07,458
Ten of them are coming, armed.

338
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:09,011
Not the others... the tents.

339
00:21:09,133 --> 00:21:11,268
We can camouflage the dynamite
next to the tents,

340
00:21:11,398 --> 00:21:13,680
target it from our positions
at the tree line.

341
00:21:15,570 --> 00:21:18,366
Juliet marked three tents.
That means we need three guns.

342
00:21:19,886 --> 00:21:21,713
Here. You can have mine, too.

343
00:21:23,848 --> 00:21:24,926
I'll be your third.

344
00:21:26,751 --> 00:21:28,771
I'll take your gun,
but you're not staying here.

345
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:33,768
You're gonna lead everyone
to the radio tower... Everyone.

346
00:21:33,927 --> 00:21:34,951
The radio tower?

347
00:21:35,082 --> 00:21:37,232
If this doesn't work,
we can't risk losing the chance

348
00:21:37,354 --> 00:21:38,966
of getting in contact with Naomi's boat,

349
00:21:39,088 --> 00:21:41,227
so everything has to happen
at the same time.

350
00:21:46,492 --> 00:21:47,697
You still up for a swim?

351
00:21:51,053 --> 00:21:52,219
Yeah, I believe I am.

352
00:21:54,365 --> 00:21:55,365
I'll go with him.

353
00:21:56,552 --> 00:21:58,785
Okay, better get to it.

354
00:22:15,306 --> 00:22:16,646
It's here, baby brother.

355
00:22:16,951 --> 00:22:17,990
Christmas is here.

356
00:22:21,115 --> 00:22:22,977
Are these the birds from row two?

357
00:22:24,977 --> 00:22:26,158
Well done, mate.

358
00:22:32,038 --> 00:22:33,832
Well, as you have spent another year

359
00:22:34,249 --> 00:22:37,030
as the only drug-free
rock star in the world,

360
00:22:37,342 --> 00:22:39,476
I'm gonna share
a little-known fact with you.

361
00:22:42,236 --> 00:22:45,517
Father christmas lives
just down the street from here.

362
00:22:45,698 --> 00:22:47,310
Father christmas lives in Helsinki?

363
00:22:47,454 --> 00:22:48,612
Indeed he does,

364
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:50,641
and in case you haven't noticed,
baby brother,

365
00:22:51,016 --> 00:22:53,048
Finland is the bloody north pole.

366
00:22:55,722 --> 00:22:59,559
Therefore, I have a very special
gift for you this year.

367
00:23:05,490 --> 00:23:07,617
Liam, no. Mum gave you that.

368
00:23:07,936 --> 00:23:09,060
You're the firstborn.

369
00:23:09,648 --> 00:23:12,343
It was her father's
and his father before that.

370
00:23:12,465 --> 00:23:14,784
And it's a family heirloom,
and at's why we named the band

371
00:23:14,925 --> 00:23:16,111
after Dexter bloody Stratton.

372
00:23:16,252 --> 00:23:17,303
I know.

373
00:23:17,471 --> 00:23:19,605
But, Charlie, let's be honest.

374
00:23:21,428 --> 00:23:23,205
We both know I'm a sodding mess.

375
00:23:23,739 --> 00:23:25,725
But you... You're different.

376
00:23:26,135 --> 00:23:28,334
You're gonna get married,
have a family...

377
00:23:29,302 --> 00:23:30,404
A baby.

378
00:23:31,802 --> 00:23:33,138
I'll be lucky if I hit 30.

379
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:34,384
Don't say that, Lee.

380
00:23:35,021 --> 00:23:37,530
The ring has to stay
in the family, Charlie.

381
00:23:39,054 --> 00:23:40,054
So, please...

382
00:23:41,615 --> 00:23:42,615
Take it.

383
00:23:43,991 --> 00:23:45,706
Mum would have wanted it this way.

384
00:23:46,303 --> 00:23:48,340
Pass it on to your little one someday.

385
00:23:49,042 --> 00:23:50,733
I need to know it's safe.

386
00:23:57,977 --> 00:23:59,215
I'll hold on to it...

387
00:24:02,502 --> 00:24:03,665
but I won't take it.

388
00:24:07,587 --> 00:24:09,427
Hey, it fits. Look at that.

389
00:24:11,852 --> 00:24:13,260
Happy christmas, baby brother.

390
00:24:45,054 --> 00:24:46,099
You need some help?

391
00:24:47,994 --> 00:24:50,128
Why didn't you tell me
you were gonna do this?

392
00:24:55,858 --> 00:24:57,232
I didn't want you to worry.

393
00:24:58,849 --> 00:25:00,370
Well, it's dangerous, isn't it,

394
00:25:00,514 --> 00:25:02,513
swimming into some underwater station?

395
00:25:03,212 --> 00:25:06,085
It's what needs to be done
to get us all rescued.

396
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:09,846
I'll be fine, Claire.

397
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:12,829
But you gotta promise me something.

398
00:25:14,599 --> 00:25:15,616
While I'm gone...

399
00:25:19,119 --> 00:25:20,379
Don't worry about me.

400
00:25:33,652 --> 00:25:34,697
I'll take him.

401
00:25:37,632 --> 00:25:38,632
Thanks.

402
00:25:45,345 --> 00:25:46,627
Alright, turnip head.

403
00:25:48,573 --> 00:25:50,304
Now you take care of your mum

404
00:25:51,313 --> 00:25:52,539
while I'm away, okay?

405
00:26:02,443 --> 00:26:03,443
I love you.

406
00:26:23,254 --> 00:26:24,287
See you soon.

407
00:26:28,267 --> 00:26:29,430
Be careful, Charlie.

408
00:26:30,732 --> 00:26:31,758
Okay?

409
00:27:25,791 --> 00:27:26,926
Sorry, guys.

410
00:27:27,283 --> 00:27:28,356
Thanks, man.

411
00:27:38,611 --> 00:27:40,882
Help! Help me!

412
00:27:44,513 --> 00:27:45,603
Please!

413
00:27:46,887 --> 00:27:47,802
You, stop!

414
00:27:48,823 --> 00:27:50,436
Get the hell away from her!

415
00:27:51,464 --> 00:27:52,467
What are you doing?

416
00:27:52,589 --> 00:27:53,589
Leave her alone!

417
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:57,840
You okay, miss?

418
00:27:58,401 --> 00:28:00,386
Yes. I think so, yes.

419
00:28:02,777 --> 00:28:03,777
Here you go.

420
00:28:05,418 --> 00:28:06,966
Pardon me while I have a heart attack.

421
00:28:07,088 --> 00:28:09,322
The last time I was in a fight,
I was 8 years old.

422
00:28:12,470 --> 00:28:13,589
And I lost.

423
00:28:14,806 --> 00:28:18,212
Well, that makes you even more
of a hero, doesn't it?

424
00:28:19,088 --> 00:28:20,572
I just did what anyone would do.

425
00:28:21,283 --> 00:28:23,622
Three people walked by the alley.

426
00:28:24,651 --> 00:28:25,753
- What?
- They saw me,

427
00:28:26,503 --> 00:28:27,910
but they just kept on going.

428
00:28:30,589 --> 00:28:32,182
You are a hero, sir...

429
00:28:33,776 --> 00:28:36,835
And don't let anyone ever
tell you differently.

430
00:28:53,092 --> 00:28:54,924
- What's that?
- It's a weight belt.

431
00:28:55,466 --> 00:28:57,810
It should bring you down
quicker than swimming.

432
00:28:59,204 --> 00:29:00,726
Well, every second counts.

433
00:29:02,528 --> 00:29:04,530
So I just take it off when I hit bottom,

434
00:29:05,093 --> 00:29:06,806
swim up through the moon pool,

435
00:29:07,151 --> 00:29:08,344
into the station,

436
00:29:09,350 --> 00:29:13,108
swim into whichever room
has the yellow blinking switch,

437
00:29:14,607 --> 00:29:15,685
flip it.

438
00:29:18,061 --> 00:29:19,085
Nothing to it.

439
00:29:23,784 --> 00:29:26,879
So how long
can you really hold your breath for?

440
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,090
Does it matter?

441
00:29:37,955 --> 00:29:40,726
- Do you want me to hit another one?
- No, you've made your point.

442
00:29:40,955 --> 00:29:44,018
Bernard, this is not pheasant hunting
in Montgomery county.

443
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:45,773
- I know what I'm doing.
- No.

444
00:29:45,895 --> 00:29:48,848
- Pheasants don't shoot back.
- Nothing's gonna happen to me, Rose.

445
00:29:49,142 --> 00:29:52,400
I just have to shoot a tent,
and I'll be right behind you.

446
00:29:52,870 --> 00:29:54,050
Then I'm staying, too.

447
00:29:54,905 --> 00:29:56,017
No, you're not, Rose.

448
00:29:58,163 --> 00:30:00,524
Everyone's gathering down
at the south end of the beach.

449
00:30:01,101 --> 00:30:02,786
No one's staying behind
but the shooters.

450
00:30:02,917 --> 00:30:05,039
Says who? You wanna give me your word

451
00:30:05,161 --> 00:30:08,069
that nothing's gonna happen
to my husband, then I'll go.

452
00:30:10,282 --> 00:30:12,393
I'll give you my word
that if we don't kill everyone

453
00:30:12,515 --> 00:30:14,276
who shows up here in about an hour,

454
00:30:14,587 --> 00:30:16,472
it's not gonna matter where Bernard is.

455
00:30:17,877 --> 00:30:20,091
I like you better
since you got back, Jack.

456
00:30:20,457 --> 00:30:21,990
You're almost an optimist.

457
00:30:22,876 --> 00:30:25,208
Come on.
If you're gonna be hiding in the bushes,

458
00:30:25,330 --> 00:30:26,972
let's get you into somethin' dark.

459
00:30:31,016 --> 00:30:32,246
You better get going.

460
00:30:32,956 --> 00:30:35,415
Rousseau says it's about
a day's walk up to the radio tower.

461
00:30:35,537 --> 00:30:37,808
I'm not taking them to the tower.
You are.

462
00:30:39,992 --> 00:30:42,268
- Excuse me?
- You're not staying behind.

463
00:30:43,644 --> 00:30:44,792
This was my idea.

464
00:30:44,914 --> 00:30:46,654
And I'm perfectly capable
of executing it.

465
00:30:46,776 --> 00:30:49,097
- I owe them!
- What are you more concerned with,

466
00:30:49,762 --> 00:30:52,725
killing the others
or getting our people off this island?

467
00:30:55,395 --> 00:30:57,548
This afternoon,
you said you were our leader.

468
00:31:02,517 --> 00:31:04,148
It's time for you to act like one.

469
00:31:08,955 --> 00:31:11,010
Lead them to the radio tower, Jack...

470
00:31:13,191 --> 00:31:14,713
and then take us all home.

471
00:31:26,097 --> 00:31:27,641
Dudes, wait!

472
00:31:32,635 --> 00:31:34,880
I heard what you're doing.
I wanna come with.

473
00:31:38,153 --> 00:31:41,093
Everyone...
They're all going to the radio tower,

474
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:45,670
and I'm sick of trekking and,
you know, explosions.

475
00:31:47,202 --> 00:31:48,882
I think I can help you guys out.

476
00:31:49,888 --> 00:31:51,330
I'm a really good paddler.

477
00:31:57,829 --> 00:31:58,995
You can't go, Hurley.

478
00:32:00,874 --> 00:32:01,956
Why not?

479
00:32:04,519 --> 00:32:05,519
Because...

480
00:32:08,113 --> 00:32:09,214
you're too big.

481
00:32:10,503 --> 00:32:11,944
You won't fit in the boat.

482
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:21,009
That's uncool, man.

483
00:32:24,034 --> 00:32:25,169
Wait.

484
00:32:29,737 --> 00:32:32,405
Dude, it's fine. I don't even
wanna go on your stupid boat.

485
00:32:38,687 --> 00:32:40,061
I'll catch up with you later.

486
00:32:41,068 --> 00:32:42,271
Just remember I love you, man.

487
00:32:43,331 --> 00:32:44,796
Yeah, whatever. I love you, too.

488
00:33:01,019 --> 00:33:02,709
You got water in there? Good, good.

489
00:33:03,298 --> 00:33:04,661
How about you? Bottled water?

490
00:33:05,108 --> 00:33:06,130
Good.

491
00:33:10,687 --> 00:33:11,973
So here we go again, huh?

492
00:33:13,813 --> 00:33:14,864
Here we go again.

493
00:33:18,498 --> 00:33:20,247
The tents are all marked. We're set.

494
00:33:21,174 --> 00:33:22,666
Sayid find the third shooter?

495
00:33:34,205 --> 00:33:36,178
Ready, Claire?
Need a hand with the little guy?

496
00:33:36,702 --> 00:33:38,031
No, thanks. I'm okay.

497
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:47,307
How's my little sweetheart?

498
00:33:50,677 --> 00:33:53,568
We're just gonna go for a little walk,
so hold onto mum, okay?

499
00:34:17,839 --> 00:34:18,912
This is it!

500
00:34:26,985 --> 00:34:28,036
Ready?

501
00:35:43,451 --> 00:35:44,654
Do you want a blanket?

502
00:35:45,264 --> 00:35:46,582
Oh, thanks. I've got one.

503
00:35:47,894 --> 00:35:49,279
Well, you're warming for two.

504
00:35:49,674 --> 00:35:50,725
Take mine.

505
00:35:53,094 --> 00:35:54,138
Thank you.

506
00:36:02,874 --> 00:36:05,722
So... first plane crash?

507
00:36:07,149 --> 00:36:08,163
What gave it away?

508
00:36:08,763 --> 00:36:10,716
Ah, you can always spot the newbies.

509
00:36:15,944 --> 00:36:17,556
We're gonna be okay, you know.

510
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:20,662
Are we?

511
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:22,599
We're alive.

512
00:36:23,388 --> 00:36:24,977
We're on a beautiful island.

513
00:36:26,112 --> 00:36:27,537
We'll sleep under the stars,

514
00:36:28,057 --> 00:36:30,932
and before you know it, the helicopters
will come and take us all home.

515
00:36:32,959 --> 00:36:34,446
You really think they'll find us?

516
00:36:35,832 --> 00:36:37,285
Well, yeah. Why wouldn't they?

517
00:36:40,303 --> 00:36:41,399
Thanks.

518
00:36:43,890 --> 00:36:44,935
I'm Charlie.

519
00:36:45,271 --> 00:36:46,360
I'm Claire.

520
00:36:46,997 --> 00:36:48,314
Nice to meet you, Charlie.

521
00:36:48,795 --> 00:36:49,987
It's nice to meet you.

522
00:37:11,691 --> 00:37:12,906
We're here.

523
00:37:23,845 --> 00:37:25,579
I want you to give this
to Claire for me.

524
00:37:32,284 --> 00:37:33,284
What is it?

525
00:37:38,531 --> 00:37:40,475
It's the five best moments of my...

526
00:37:42,296 --> 00:37:43,693
sorry excuse for a life.

527
00:37:47,203 --> 00:37:48,408
My greatest hits.

528
00:37:54,405 --> 00:37:55,405
You know...

529
00:37:59,033 --> 00:38:00,033
memories...

530
00:38:01,872 --> 00:38:02,968
are all I've got.

531
00:38:05,386 --> 00:38:06,568
You don't have to do this.

532
00:38:08,386 --> 00:38:09,396
What?

533
00:38:11,405 --> 00:38:12,405
I'll go.

534
00:38:13,602 --> 00:38:15,163
No, your... Your flashes...

535
00:38:15,375 --> 00:38:16,380
Maybe...

536
00:38:17,242 --> 00:38:19,261
I keep seeing you die because...

537
00:38:21,848 --> 00:38:23,506
I'm supposed to take your place.

538
00:38:29,386 --> 00:38:30,635
What about your girl...

539
00:38:31,487 --> 00:38:32,594
Penny?

540
00:38:34,821 --> 00:38:36,024
What about your girl?

541
00:38:40,737 --> 00:38:41,844
Besides...

542
00:38:46,228 --> 00:38:47,599
I might be luckier than you.

543
00:38:57,603 --> 00:38:59,090
Keep your memories to yourself.

544
00:39:03,146 --> 00:39:04,418
I'll take it from here.

545
00:39:12,521 --> 00:39:13,781
I don't know what to say.

546
00:39:17,384 --> 00:39:20,085
Well, you can tell me where the,
the weight belt is.

547
00:39:21,448 --> 00:39:22,708
Right there behind you.

548
00:39:49,042 --> 00:39:50,336
You and I both know...

549
00:39:51,618 --> 00:39:53,570
You aren't supposed
to take my place, brother.

550
00:41:58,363 --> 00:41:59,595
I'm alive.
