1
00:01:33,939 --> 00:01:34,883
Emma!

2
00:01:35,910 --> 00:01:37,762
My sister, my sister!

3
00:01:37,948 --> 00:01:40,212
Emma! Emma!

4
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:01,550
I'll be right back.

5
00:02:05,266 --> 00:02:06,926
She's not breathing. Watch out.

6
00:02:14,593 --> 00:02:15,442
Come with me.

7
00:02:24,603 --> 00:02:27,152
Don't worry. She will be fine.

8
00:02:38,829 --> 00:02:42,353
Good. Let it out. You okay?

9
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,127
Where's my mom?

10
00:02:48,118 --> 00:02:49,250
I don't know.

11
00:02:50,743 --> 00:02:53,314
She's meeting us
in Los Angeles.

12
00:02:54,436 --> 00:02:59,773
Pam! Pam!
Has anybody seen my wife? Pam!

13
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:02,325
We're not there yet...

14
00:03:06,289 --> 00:03:09,190
But I promise we're gonna
get you home soon, okay?

15
00:03:49,016 --> 00:03:49,961
Excuse me.

16
00:03:54,725 --> 00:03:56,533
Would you look
after the children?

17
00:03:59,055 --> 00:04:01,051
There's something I have to do.

18
00:04:05,536 --> 00:04:06,890
Uh, okay.

19
00:04:09,698 --> 00:04:11,880
Stay with this nice woman.

20
00:04:12,777 --> 00:04:14,570
I'll be back in a minute.

21
00:04:36,896 --> 00:04:39,650
Oh, my leg! My leg! Oh!

22
00:04:39,798 --> 00:04:41,983
Is it bad? Oh.
It's bad, isn't it?

23
00:04:42,128 --> 00:04:44,353
No. It's not that bad.

24
00:04:44,547 --> 00:04:47,870
I broke my leg skiing up at Stowe,
in Vermont.

25
00:04:47,997 --> 00:04:50,420
I was on this run
going pretty fast.

26
00:04:50,517 --> 00:04:53,740
I was racing this
cute ski patrol guy.

27
00:04:53,885 --> 00:04:56,642
I went off this mogul,
lost my edge, and...

28
00:04:56,785 --> 00:04:59,110
- Bam!
- Aah!

29
00:05:01,546 --> 00:05:03,493
Snapped my left leg.

30
00:05:04,568 --> 00:05:05,750
Now that...

31
00:05:05,847 --> 00:05:06,933
that was bad.

32
00:05:10,665 --> 00:05:11,942
You a doctor?

33
00:05:12,278 --> 00:05:14,502
A year of med school
before I dropped out.

34
00:05:15,257 --> 00:05:17,962
I'm a clinical psychologist.

35
00:05:20,955 --> 00:05:23,812
You saved that girl's life.
Are you a doctor?

36
00:05:25,778 --> 00:05:26,671
No.

37
00:05:27,116 --> 00:05:28,063
Help!

38
00:05:28,577 --> 00:05:30,662
Hey! I need some help!

39
00:05:30,898 --> 00:05:33,601
There's somebody in the jungle!
He's alive!

40
00:05:36,505 --> 00:05:41,461
Help! Help me! Please help me!

41
00:05:45,158 --> 00:05:46,002
Help!

42
00:05:48,808 --> 00:05:49,650
Help!

43
00:05:53,258 --> 00:05:54,351
We should climb up there.

44
00:05:54,387 --> 00:05:55,872
I'll hold him steady,
you pull him--

45
00:05:55,905 --> 00:05:58,133
No, no, wait. What's your name?

46
00:05:58,325 --> 00:06:00,793
Uh... uh, uh, Bernard!

47
00:06:00,887 --> 00:06:02,640
You're gonna be
all right, Bernard.

48
00:06:03,487 --> 00:06:05,861
I need you to unbuckle
your seat belt

49
00:06:05,958 --> 00:06:08,562
and grab the branch
next to you.

50
00:06:11,096 --> 00:06:13,991
Is he dead? I think he's dead!

51
00:06:14,138 --> 00:06:15,471
Maybe we should
climb up there...

52
00:06:15,508 --> 00:06:17,401
No! I need you to
focus, Bernard.

53
00:06:17,546 --> 00:06:20,112
Unbuckle your seat belt.

54
00:06:27,357 --> 00:06:30,063
Now grab the branch
next to you.

55
00:06:33,016 --> 00:06:34,412
I don't think I can do that.

56
00:06:34,476 --> 00:06:36,853
Bernard, those seats
are gonna fall.

57
00:06:53,575 --> 00:06:55,091
Come on, you can do it.

58
00:06:57,388 --> 00:06:58,181
Bernard!

59
00:07:07,677 --> 00:07:08,621
All right.

60
00:07:08,806 --> 00:07:09,942
Hold on tight, okay?

61
00:07:10,438 --> 00:07:12,333
I'm coming up to get ya.

62
00:07:25,998 --> 00:07:27,942
Does anybody have any water?

63
00:07:28,227 --> 00:07:29,303
No, not here.

64
00:07:34,495 --> 00:07:36,353
Couldn't find any matches?

65
00:07:36,746 --> 00:07:37,832
Dry ones?

66
00:07:38,827 --> 00:07:41,021
You can ask around,
but I couldn't find any.

67
00:07:41,797 --> 00:07:43,121
It's gonna be dark soon.

68
00:07:43,308 --> 00:07:46,023
Gonna get a signal fire
started so they can find us.

69
00:07:46,486 --> 00:07:50,243
- What are you, a boy scout?
- A grown-up version.

70
00:07:50,438 --> 00:07:51,992
I'm in the peace corps.

71
00:07:52,466 --> 00:07:54,123
They still have that?

72
00:07:55,105 --> 00:07:58,292
I'm just happy somebody your
age actually knows what it is.

73
00:08:04,048 --> 00:08:05,323
What's your name?

74
00:08:05,508 --> 00:08:06,490
Goodwin.

75
00:08:07,716 --> 00:08:09,802
I'm Ana Lucia.

76
00:08:40,796 --> 00:08:42,171
I heard that...

77
00:08:42,825 --> 00:08:44,582
you were the one who...

78
00:08:45,745 --> 00:08:48,122
pulled the dead bodies
out of the water.

79
00:08:50,366 --> 00:08:51,071
Yes.

80
00:08:54,205 --> 00:08:56,862
Were any of
them african-american?

81
00:08:58,465 --> 00:08:59,113
No.

82
00:09:03,466 --> 00:09:04,310
It's my wife...

83
00:09:07,726 --> 00:09:09,471
I can't find her.

84
00:09:11,625 --> 00:09:13,241
I will pray for her.

85
00:09:17,865 --> 00:09:20,143
Where the hell are
the rescue planes?

86
00:09:22,765 --> 00:09:24,991
I will pray for them, too.

87
00:09:32,147 --> 00:09:32,663
Yeah.

88
00:10:01,555 --> 00:10:02,492
What was that?

89
00:10:06,147 --> 00:10:06,953
Libby...

90
00:10:07,466 --> 00:10:08,591
watch the kids.

91
00:10:09,716 --> 00:10:10,650
Over here.

92
00:10:12,937 --> 00:10:15,212
It's all right. We'll be okay.

93
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:29,100
What happened?

94
00:10:57,905 --> 00:10:59,132
No wallet.

95
00:11:00,256 --> 00:11:01,533
No cell phone.

96
00:11:02,518 --> 00:11:04,552
No keys, nothing.

97
00:11:08,548 --> 00:11:09,230
Hey.

98
00:11:14,098 --> 00:11:15,801
Are you okay?

99
00:11:18,187 --> 00:11:18,893
Hey!

100
00:11:20,488 --> 00:11:24,101
Look, three of the people are missing--
the blond guy,

101
00:11:24,255 --> 00:11:27,011
the curly-haired guy and the german
who was helping us with the injured.

102
00:11:27,046 --> 00:11:28,491
- Did you see anything?
- No, I didn't.

103
00:11:28,528 --> 00:11:30,233
Where they came from,
how many there were?

104
00:11:30,266 --> 00:11:31,563
No, I didn't see anything.

105
00:11:32,705 --> 00:11:34,031
Who are these people?

106
00:11:34,187 --> 00:11:38,032
I don't know, but they're out
here in the jungle with no shoes,

107
00:11:38,126 --> 00:11:41,743
nothing in their pockets,
no labels on their clothes.

108
00:11:43,005 --> 00:11:45,771
These people were
here before us.

109
00:11:51,715 --> 00:11:53,451
We need to get off the beach.

110
00:11:54,066 --> 00:11:55,863
We need to find a safer place.

111
00:11:56,288 --> 00:11:59,781
We've got kids and people
who are seriously hurt.

112
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:01,842
Where are we going to go, hmm?

113
00:12:02,677 --> 00:12:04,661
How are we going to move them?

114
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:06,052
And what about the signal fire?

115
00:12:06,086 --> 00:12:09,552
How are we all going to get
rescued if we're off the beach?

116
00:12:09,836 --> 00:12:11,092
Nathan's right.

117
00:12:11,208 --> 00:12:14,280
They have satellites,
the black box.

118
00:12:14,476 --> 00:12:17,083
We don't need a fire
for them to find us.

119
00:12:17,185 --> 00:12:19,032
Yes, we do.

120
00:12:21,888 --> 00:12:27,451
Before the crash, the pilot said we'd
lost communication. We were
turning back.

121
00:12:27,705 --> 00:12:31,400
We were flying for two hours
in the wrong direction.

122
00:12:31,737 --> 00:12:33,692
They don't know where to look.

123
00:13:05,748 --> 00:13:11,032
It's Donald. His leg--
the infection is getting worse.

124
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:13,943
He'll be the fourth to go.

125
00:13:16,076 --> 00:13:18,880
What are we supposed
to do about that?

126
00:14:04,475 --> 00:14:06,382
Now come here.
Come on, grab it, grab it!

127
00:14:06,418 --> 00:14:09,012
Over here! Come on! Over here!

128
00:14:14,156 --> 00:14:15,503
I got it, I got it, got it.

129
00:14:15,615 --> 00:14:18,902
No, I got it, I got it.
All right. I've got it, I got it.

130
00:14:43,877 --> 00:14:45,342
Would you like some chicken?

131
00:14:53,196 --> 00:14:55,420
You haven't said
a word in a week.

132
00:14:57,858 --> 00:14:59,623
Why aren't you talking?

133
00:15:04,527 --> 00:15:05,321
Hey.

134
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:09,712
It wasn't your fault, you know.

135
00:15:11,168 --> 00:15:13,682
You were just
defending yourself.

136
00:15:34,838 --> 00:15:36,763
- That'll work.
- Yeah.

137
00:15:37,207 --> 00:15:39,700
I heard a pig or
something out there.

138
00:15:39,848 --> 00:15:42,043
Maybe we can have
some bacon tomorrow.

139
00:15:51,808 --> 00:15:52,650
What?

140
00:15:56,678 --> 00:15:58,102
Where were you?

141
00:15:59,407 --> 00:16:01,012
I had to go to the bathroom.

142
00:16:01,298 --> 00:16:03,201
We have a system for that.

143
00:16:03,388 --> 00:16:05,420
We go in pairs.

144
00:16:07,153 --> 00:16:08,734
Yeah, sorry.

145
00:16:56,096 --> 00:16:58,173
Help!

146
00:16:58,630 --> 00:16:59,545
The kids!

147
00:16:59,629 --> 00:17:01,010
They took the kids!

148
00:17:16,358 --> 00:17:17,912
They took Jed and Eli!

149
00:17:18,647 --> 00:17:19,853
Nancy's gone.

150
00:17:20,255 --> 00:17:21,432
They're gone.

151
00:17:21,558 --> 00:17:22,983
Which way did they go?

152
00:17:23,498 --> 00:17:25,300
Which way did they go?!

153
00:17:28,056 --> 00:17:30,231
Wake up, wake up!

154
00:17:30,328 --> 00:17:32,491
Who are you? Talk to me!

155
00:17:32,777 --> 00:17:33,842
She's dead.

156
00:17:34,737 --> 00:17:35,813
She's dead.

157
00:17:42,365 --> 00:17:43,543
What are you doing?

158
00:17:47,425 --> 00:17:48,823
Is that a knife?

159
00:17:55,906 --> 00:17:57,150
What is that?

160
00:18:03,828 --> 00:18:05,242
It's a list.

161
00:18:08,847 --> 00:18:10,503
A list of what?

162
00:18:10,735 --> 00:18:11,752
Nine...

163
00:18:12,055 --> 00:18:13,382
of us.

164
00:18:21,985 --> 00:18:22,881
Nothing?

165
00:18:24,655 --> 00:18:27,202
They dragged nine
people into the jungle,

166
00:18:27,275 --> 00:18:28,372
the kids,

167
00:18:29,016 --> 00:18:31,480
and there's no sign of 'em?

168
00:18:35,698 --> 00:18:38,022
Now's not a good time to talk?

169
00:18:42,805 --> 00:18:45,312
What needs to happen to
make you say something?!

170
00:18:45,407 --> 00:18:47,543
Hey, calm down.
Let's figure this out.

171
00:18:48,105 --> 00:18:49,431
"Calm down"?

172
00:18:49,526 --> 00:18:51,370
"Let's figure this out"?

173
00:18:51,606 --> 00:18:55,032
Here are the names of every
single person they took--

174
00:18:55,125 --> 00:18:58,891
all nine of them, what they were
wearing, what they look like.

175
00:18:58,988 --> 00:19:01,883
One of them had a list of us.

176
00:19:02,585 --> 00:19:04,942
They could have gotten our names
from the people they already took.

177
00:19:04,978 --> 00:19:07,811
Nobody knew anybody's
names the first night.

178
00:19:07,935 --> 00:19:09,673
Maybe they're watching us.

179
00:19:11,238 --> 00:19:13,942
You were gone for
two hours yesterday.

180
00:19:14,806 --> 00:19:15,443
What?

181
00:19:15,517 --> 00:19:17,611
- Where were you?
- I was going to the bathroom.

182
00:19:17,645 --> 00:19:18,543
Hey, stop!

183
00:19:19,808 --> 00:19:21,240
We're all scared.

184
00:19:22,485 --> 00:19:23,782
Let's not get paranoid here.

185
00:19:23,818 --> 00:19:25,900
We don't know anything.

186
00:19:26,658 --> 00:19:27,781
He's right.

187
00:19:27,975 --> 00:19:31,160
Why would they try
to infiltrate us?

188
00:19:31,257 --> 00:19:32,761
I mean, that's crazy.

189
00:19:32,865 --> 00:19:35,081
Well, whoever they are,
they know we are here.

190
00:19:35,117 --> 00:19:37,422
We need to leave this beach.

191
00:19:38,977 --> 00:19:42,103
You said we needed to
keepthe signal fire burning.

192
00:19:44,217 --> 00:19:46,801
I think it's time
we let it go out.

193
00:20:27,277 --> 00:20:28,121
Five minutes.

194
00:20:30,457 --> 00:20:34,423
Ah, we've been walking for
three days straight, Ana.

195
00:20:34,506 --> 00:20:36,663
And you're still here.
Five minutes.

196
00:20:36,896 --> 00:20:40,682
You know what?
Y'all want to keep walking, go ahead.

197
00:20:40,838 --> 00:20:44,250
Fresh water, rock wall at our backs,
lots of fruit trees.

198
00:20:44,366 --> 00:20:46,062
Right here looks
pretty goodto me.

199
00:20:55,057 --> 00:20:57,770
Fine, okay.

200
00:21:00,157 --> 00:21:01,292
This will work.

201
00:21:11,905 --> 00:21:12,650
Hey.

202
00:21:13,736 --> 00:21:14,503
Hey.

203
00:21:17,805 --> 00:21:21,990
Back at the beach,
the night they came back,

204
00:21:22,696 --> 00:21:27,521
you said that Nathan was gone for
two hours, that he was missing.

205
00:21:29,657 --> 00:21:31,740
He creeps me out, Ana.

206
00:21:35,307 --> 00:21:37,962
You really think it's
possible that one of us...

207
00:21:39,928 --> 00:21:41,322
is one of them?

208
00:21:42,098 --> 00:21:44,521
Why do you think I'm
digging this hole?

209
00:21:53,176 --> 00:21:55,750
Are we really going to be able
to catch rabbits with this?

210
00:21:55,787 --> 00:21:57,561
Oh, yeah.
Give me another stick.

211
00:22:03,297 --> 00:22:04,401
Oh, hey, Ana.

212
00:22:06,747 --> 00:22:07,542
Ana!

213
00:22:17,786 --> 00:22:18,733
what are you doing?

214
00:22:19,145 --> 00:22:21,673
You and I are going to have
a little talk, Nathan.

215
00:22:22,985 --> 00:22:25,543
You let me out of
here right now!

216
00:22:25,648 --> 00:22:28,351
You let me out!
You let me out, or I'll...

217
00:22:29,586 --> 00:22:30,671
I didn't do anything, Ana!

218
00:22:30,708 --> 00:22:32,302
- He wasn't on the plane.
- What?

219
00:22:32,318 --> 00:22:33,852
We were in the
air for two hours.

220
00:22:33,888 --> 00:22:35,792
I didn't see him once,
not once.

221
00:22:35,875 --> 00:22:37,441
It's a big plane, Ana.
Just because you didn't--

222
00:22:37,475 --> 00:22:38,872
No, I didn't see him either.

223
00:22:38,895 --> 00:22:42,491
And I'm pretty good with faces of the
passengers, and I did not see him.

224
00:22:42,606 --> 00:22:44,002
Wait, you're not all serious.

225
00:22:44,038 --> 00:22:46,110
He never talks about
himself-- Nathan.

226
00:22:46,275 --> 00:22:49,073
Every time I ask him anything,
he just dodges.

227
00:22:49,196 --> 00:22:52,291
No. If he really were one of them,
why would he still be here?

228
00:22:52,337 --> 00:22:54,660
I don't know,
but I'm gonna find out.

229
00:22:55,926 --> 00:22:58,643
Will you let me out?! Ana!

230
00:23:01,868 --> 00:23:03,590
You got a problem with this?

231
00:23:04,705 --> 00:23:06,123
I didn't do anything!

232
00:23:08,895 --> 00:23:09,953
Let me out!

233
00:23:31,995 --> 00:23:33,393
Where are the kids?

234
00:23:35,547 --> 00:23:37,160
Where are the kids?

235
00:23:42,626 --> 00:23:44,570
Where are you from, Nathan?

236
00:23:47,247 --> 00:23:48,231
Canada.

237
00:23:48,377 --> 00:23:50,163
What were you
doing in Australia?

238
00:23:50,318 --> 00:23:51,532
Company retreat.

239
00:23:51,608 --> 00:23:53,162
- Where are they?
- What?

240
00:23:53,317 --> 00:23:55,081
They rest of your retreat.
Where are they?

241
00:23:55,117 --> 00:23:56,673
They weren't on the plane.

242
00:23:57,158 --> 00:23:59,892
I stayed a couple
extra days to sightsee.

243
00:24:00,035 --> 00:24:02,042
How come nobody saw you
on the plane, Nathan?

244
00:24:02,078 --> 00:24:04,782
- I was in the lavatory.
- For two hours?

245
00:24:04,957 --> 00:24:07,121
I don't remember seeing you
on the plane, Ana Lucia.

246
00:24:07,155 --> 00:24:08,800
That's because
you weren't on it.

247
00:24:15,078 --> 00:24:16,620
Where are the kids, Nathan?

248
00:24:21,837 --> 00:24:23,593
Where are the kids?

249
00:24:26,487 --> 00:24:28,691
You're not talking
to me anymore?

250
00:24:35,985 --> 00:24:37,442
What's that behind you?

251
00:24:39,688 --> 00:24:40,640
Get up!

252
00:24:44,556 --> 00:24:45,920
I said, "get up"!

253
00:24:51,816 --> 00:24:53,670
- Who gave him food?
- What happened?

254
00:24:53,818 --> 00:24:57,101
I'm trying to find out what they did
to us, and you're taking care of him.

255
00:24:57,135 --> 00:24:58,463
I didn't do anything.

256
00:24:58,797 --> 00:25:00,360
And what if you're wrong, Ana?

257
00:25:00,515 --> 00:25:02,851
We don't even know
that there is a spy.

258
00:25:02,967 --> 00:25:07,203
Whose idea was it to stay at the beach
where they could pick us off one by one?

259
00:25:07,308 --> 00:25:08,771
His, Nathan's.

260
00:25:08,935 --> 00:25:12,051
Well, they haven't come
since you put him in there.

261
00:25:12,196 --> 00:25:13,352
Who did it?

262
00:25:19,437 --> 00:25:20,073
You?

263
00:25:54,235 --> 00:25:55,681
We're worried about you, Ana.

264
00:25:57,156 --> 00:25:59,333
You've had him down
there four days.

265
00:26:02,525 --> 00:26:06,250
I promised that little girl that I
would get her back home to her mom.

266
00:26:14,658 --> 00:26:15,802
You have any kids, Ana?

267
00:26:21,307 --> 00:26:21,910
No.

268
00:26:31,927 --> 00:26:33,143
We should let him go.

269
00:26:35,908 --> 00:26:37,592
We're not savages.

270
00:26:38,876 --> 00:26:42,041
If I were a savage,
I would have cut off his finger already.

271
00:26:44,248 --> 00:26:45,832
That's tomorrow.

272
00:27:15,975 --> 00:27:18,850
Grab the rope!
I'll pull you up!

273
00:27:31,368 --> 00:27:32,663
Ana Lucia is, uh...

274
00:27:32,905 --> 00:27:35,683
I think we all think that
she's gonna hurt you.

275
00:27:35,935 --> 00:27:37,993
Now you need to
get away from here.

276
00:27:38,935 --> 00:27:41,081
There's some fruit in there.
Now just go.

277
00:27:43,038 --> 00:27:44,581
Which way's the beach?

278
00:27:44,708 --> 00:27:47,170
That way, maybe 5 miles.

279
00:28:12,845 --> 00:28:13,643
Morning.

280
00:28:18,675 --> 00:28:19,713
Morning.

281
00:28:23,596 --> 00:28:24,903
Ana Lucia!

282
00:28:25,906 --> 00:28:27,800
- He's gone.
- What?

283
00:28:27,968 --> 00:28:29,721
He's gone. Nathan's gone.

284
00:28:36,825 --> 00:28:38,173
Ana, what are you gonna do?

285
00:28:38,658 --> 00:28:40,411
They found us.
It's time to move.

286
00:29:21,318 --> 00:29:22,262
What is it?

287
00:29:23,708 --> 00:29:26,711
I don't know.
Some sort of bunker.

288
00:29:28,095 --> 00:29:29,701
Do you think it's theirs?

289
00:29:34,355 --> 00:29:35,641
What are you doing?

290
00:30:04,436 --> 00:30:06,091
What is this place?

291
00:30:06,696 --> 00:30:09,100
Looks like some sort
of storage facility.

292
00:30:20,438 --> 00:30:23,052
Hey, come over here.

293
00:30:32,366 --> 00:30:34,213
What was that? Get it.

294
00:30:38,266 --> 00:30:40,060
What else is in here?

295
00:30:41,825 --> 00:30:43,182
It's a glass eye.

296
00:30:56,796 --> 00:30:58,101
Look at this.

297
00:31:02,407 --> 00:31:03,503
It's a radio.

298
00:31:18,868 --> 00:31:19,641
Hello?

299
00:31:21,135 --> 00:31:22,941
Hello? Can anybody hear me?

300
00:31:25,985 --> 00:31:27,312
The hills are blocking it.

301
00:31:27,498 --> 00:31:30,190
If we want a signal,
we need to get to higher ground.

302
00:31:30,855 --> 00:31:32,521
I'll do it.

303
00:31:33,238 --> 00:31:34,472
I'll go with you.

304
00:31:34,586 --> 00:31:37,232
Nah, you should stay here, Ana,
get this place set up as a shelter.

305
00:31:37,267 --> 00:31:38,692
We can all get it set up.

306
00:31:38,886 --> 00:31:42,602
We can make it back in a
couple of hours. Let's go.

307
00:31:49,568 --> 00:31:51,913
Why do you think
they're doing this?

308
00:31:52,075 --> 00:31:54,271
Why do I think
who's doing what?

309
00:31:54,967 --> 00:31:56,273
Them.

310
00:31:56,705 --> 00:31:59,443
Don't you ever wonder
why they attack us?

311
00:32:00,305 --> 00:32:03,343
Maybe they're not attacking us.

312
00:32:05,615 --> 00:32:09,401
Yeah, they just drag us into
the jungle every now and then.

313
00:32:10,145 --> 00:32:11,523
No real harm done.

314
00:32:12,747 --> 00:32:13,663
Good point.

315
00:32:18,868 --> 00:32:22,020
Why do you think they take
some of us and not the others?

316
00:32:24,068 --> 00:32:26,550
You know, that first night
they took the strongest of us,

317
00:32:26,588 --> 00:32:30,140
your quiet friend,
three other guys.

318
00:32:30,626 --> 00:32:32,343
They're all athletic,

319
00:32:33,245 --> 00:32:34,362
tough...

320
00:32:36,087 --> 00:32:37,293
threats.

321
00:32:38,077 --> 00:32:40,153
They didn't take you.

322
00:32:43,718 --> 00:32:47,053
I guess they changed their plan
after two of 'em got killed.

323
00:32:51,106 --> 00:32:52,790
You want to take a break?

324
00:32:53,095 --> 00:32:54,520
Yeah, that's a good idea.

325
00:33:11,566 --> 00:33:12,772
Can I have the knife?

326
00:33:35,307 --> 00:33:36,231
Thank you.

327
00:33:40,207 --> 00:33:41,900
Where do you think they got it?

328
00:33:43,075 --> 00:33:45,600
I mean,
they don't even wear shoes.

329
00:33:46,128 --> 00:33:47,872
How'd they get an army knife?

330
00:33:49,327 --> 00:33:50,353
Sorry?

331
00:33:50,998 --> 00:33:53,822
That knife, it's U.S. Military.

332
00:33:58,468 --> 00:33:59,491
Here.

333
00:34:01,505 --> 00:34:03,001
I'll show you.

334
00:34:08,516 --> 00:34:10,030
You see the tang stamp?

335
00:34:11,645 --> 00:34:14,332
This knife's probably
20 years old.

336
00:34:14,615 --> 00:34:16,380
You don't see these anymore,

337
00:34:16,836 --> 00:34:21,342
yet here it is on this island.

338
00:34:22,436 --> 00:34:23,292
Weird, huh?

339
00:34:27,975 --> 00:34:29,523
Can I ask you something?

340
00:34:31,616 --> 00:34:32,861
Sure, Ana.

341
00:34:33,935 --> 00:34:38,031
When you ran out of the
jungle the day of the crash,

342
00:34:39,455 --> 00:34:43,670
how did you...
how did you find Bernard up in the tree?

343
00:34:45,147 --> 00:34:48,090
I heard him shouting
from the beach.

344
00:34:50,225 --> 00:34:52,021
From the beach?

345
00:34:55,627 --> 00:34:57,821
Why are you asking
me about that, Ana?

346
00:35:01,747 --> 00:35:03,910
Did he see you out there?

347
00:35:05,795 --> 00:35:09,030
Is that why you pretended
to be one of us?

348
00:35:14,087 --> 00:35:19,850
You ran out of the jungle ten minutes
after the crash. You weren't wet.

349
00:35:24,158 --> 00:35:26,540
You were never
even in the ocean.

350
00:35:36,628 --> 00:35:37,851
Where are they?

351
00:35:39,136 --> 00:35:40,193
Your friends.

352
00:35:44,285 --> 00:35:47,901
Nathan. What did you--

353
00:35:48,036 --> 00:35:51,430
If you had cut off his finger, and he
still told you he was on the plane,

354
00:35:51,466 --> 00:35:54,973
I think maybe you would have started
to believe you had the wrong guy.

355
00:35:57,135 --> 00:35:58,933
Did you kill him?

356
00:35:59,106 --> 00:36:01,732
Nathan was not a good person.

357
00:36:03,706 --> 00:36:06,563
That's why he
wasn't on the list.

358
00:36:14,855 --> 00:36:18,591
What about the kids?
Did you kill them, too?

359
00:36:18,686 --> 00:36:21,090
The children are fine.

360
00:36:24,578 --> 00:36:26,281
They're better off now.

361
00:37:12,616 --> 00:37:13,803
Where's Goodwin?

362
00:37:18,808 --> 00:37:20,043
We're safe here now.

363
00:37:45,325 --> 00:37:48,890
Why are you wasting your time with
that thing? There's no signal.

364
00:37:49,046 --> 00:37:51,871
I only turn it on a
couple minutes a day.

365
00:37:53,265 --> 00:37:54,821
- It really doesn't--
- Hello.

366
00:37:55,017 --> 00:37:58,751
Hello? Is anybody out there?
Mayday, mayday!

367
00:38:00,185 --> 00:38:03,961
- Is there someone there?
- Hello?! Hello?!

368
00:38:04,446 --> 00:38:06,482
- Who is that?
- Can you hear me?

369
00:38:07,117 --> 00:38:08,930
Repeat your
transmission, please.

370
00:38:09,037 --> 00:38:14,203
Hello! We're survivors of the crash
of Oceanic flight 815. Please copy.

371
00:38:14,315 --> 00:38:17,081
We're the survivors
of flight 815.

372
00:38:17,458 --> 00:38:18,992
No, wait a minute.
What are you doing?

373
00:38:19,026 --> 00:38:19,962
It's them.

374
00:38:24,065 --> 00:38:25,311
It's them.

375
00:38:27,677 --> 00:38:31,151
They're trying to draw us out.
They're trying to find us.

376
00:38:31,226 --> 00:38:33,393
No, he said "815." He said,
"flight 815."

377
00:38:33,496 --> 00:38:36,842
They know our flight number because
Goodwin knew our flight number.

378
00:38:39,138 --> 00:38:41,381
But what if there really
are survivors out there?

379
00:38:41,416 --> 00:38:43,081
There are no survivors.

380
00:38:47,637 --> 00:38:49,321
This is our life now.

381
00:38:50,418 --> 00:38:51,812
Get used to it.

382
00:39:43,857 --> 00:39:45,232
What are you looking at?

383
00:39:51,198 --> 00:39:52,792
It's going to be okay.

384
00:40:12,136 --> 00:40:13,740
What, you're talking now?

385
00:40:16,027 --> 00:40:17,853
It's been 40 days.

386
00:40:27,608 --> 00:40:30,302
You've been waiting
40 days to talk?

387
00:40:32,718 --> 00:40:35,423
You waited 40 days to cry.

388
00:41:22,307 --> 00:41:23,131
Libby.

389
00:41:33,867 --> 00:41:34,772
Turn him over.

390
00:41:34,935 --> 00:41:35,742
Is he alive?

391
00:41:40,936 --> 00:41:42,783
Get Ana Lucia, quick!

392
00:41:54,955 --> 00:41:55,983
Who are you?

393
00:42:00,146 --> 00:42:01,682
Where are you from?

394
00:42:12,086 --> 00:42:14,611
- He doesn't even speak English.
- That doesn't mean anything.

395
00:42:14,648 --> 00:42:16,193
Ana, we found him in the water.

396
00:42:16,355 --> 00:42:19,061
He has a broken
handcuff on his wrist.

397
00:42:21,556 --> 00:42:23,790
I'm not sure that
he's a threat.

398
00:42:27,206 --> 00:42:28,500
He's running!

399
00:42:31,875 --> 00:42:33,821
- Michael, Sawyer!
- Jin!

400
00:42:38,197 --> 00:42:41,573
Others, others,
others, others, others!

401
00:42:42,997 --> 00:42:43,632
Others.

402
00:43:04,717 --> 00:43:06,771
- Hit me.
- Hit you?

403
00:43:07,048 --> 00:43:08,690
You think they're okay?

404
00:43:10,137 --> 00:43:11,451
Let's find out.

405
00:43:12,145 --> 00:43:13,081
Hit me.

406
00:44:27,667 --> 00:44:29,761
- Cindy. Where's Cindy?
- Did they take her?

407
00:44:29,796 --> 00:44:30,313
Cindy!

408
00:44:54,248 --> 00:44:55,600
What was that?!

409
00:45:20,008 --> 00:45:23,613
