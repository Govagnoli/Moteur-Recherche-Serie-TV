00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:01,602
<I>Previously on</I> Lost...

2
00:00:01,696 --> 00:00:04,702
Two days after I found out
I had a fatal tumor on my spine,

3
00:00:04,796 --> 00:00:06,886
a spinal surgeon fell out of the sky.

4
00:00:06,945 --> 00:00:09,484
We had such a wonderful plan
to break you, Jack.

5
00:00:09,649 --> 00:00:12,139
My wonderful plan got shot to sunshine

6
00:00:12,209 --> 00:00:15,050
when you saw my damned x-rays
and figured out I was dying.

7
00:00:15,238 --> 00:00:17,316
You want me to save your life?

8
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:19,522
I want you to want to save my life.

9
00:00:20,779 --> 00:00:23,003
All I can ask
is that you think about it.

10
00:01:13,787 --> 00:01:15,114
Police. Open the door.

11
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:20,023
Everything's all right in here.

12
00:01:20,083 --> 00:01:21,456
Ma'am, we have reason to believe

13
00:01:21,457 --> 00:01:23,429
someone extremely dangerous
is in the motel.

14
00:01:23,499 --> 00:01:25,366
We're conducting a room-to-room search.

15
00:01:25,495 --> 00:01:26,610
I'm alone, officer.

16
00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:28,813
This person could be holding you
at gunpoint,

17
00:01:28,814 --> 00:01:29,891
forcing you to say that.

18
00:01:30,012 --> 00:01:31,242
Please open the door.

19
00:01:31,559 --> 00:01:32,757
I don't think I should.

20
00:01:32,815 --> 00:01:35,963
Ma'am, you have three seconds
before I break this door down.

21
00:01:36,269 --> 00:01:37,265
One...

22
00:01:38,087 --> 00:01:39,108
two...

23
00:01:42,008 --> 00:01:43,037
Hey.

24
00:01:44,082 --> 00:01:45,244
Wanna get it on?

25
00:01:47,863 --> 00:01:48,868
Hell, yeah.

26
00:01:54,771 --> 00:01:55,757
<i>Warning.</i>

27
00:02:00,524 --> 00:02:01,596
<i>Warning.</i>

28
00:02:04,802 --> 00:02:05,811
Hey.

29
00:02:08,166 --> 00:02:09,246
Hey yourself.

30
00:02:13,115 --> 00:02:14,219
Whatcha doing?

31
00:02:15,276 --> 00:02:16,473
Throwing rocks.

32
00:02:19,754 --> 00:02:23,505
- I thought you had to pull the lever.
- I know how to get a damn fish biscuit.

33
00:02:24,749 --> 00:02:25,959
Then get me one.

34
00:02:27,749 --> 00:02:30,247
What, you trying
to keep me feeling productive?

35
00:02:53,004 --> 00:02:55,728
You took these blood tests,
made all the notations?

36
00:02:58,135 --> 00:02:59,468
How old are the x-rays?

37
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:00,877
A week.

38
00:03:03,413 --> 00:03:05,980
The tumor on your spine
is borderline inoperable,

39
00:03:06,173 --> 00:03:07,571
and at the rate it's growing,

40
00:03:07,612 --> 00:03:09,584
that borderline goes away in about...

41
00:03:10,078 --> 00:03:11,087
one week.

42
00:03:21,435 --> 00:03:23,912
The O. R.
We were in-- is that fully equipped?

43
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:25,191
Yes.

44
00:03:25,273 --> 00:03:27,399
Anesthesia? Sterile?

45
00:03:27,481 --> 00:03:28,502
Yes.

46
00:03:33,263 --> 00:03:35,433
You need to be in surgery yesterday.

47
00:03:41,379 --> 00:03:42,389
All right, then.

48
00:03:43,634 --> 00:03:46,057
Whatever you need,
it's yours. I'm ready.

49
00:03:47,988 --> 00:03:50,006
No, I think you misunderstood me.

50
00:03:51,219 --> 00:03:52,980
I didn't say I was gonna do it.

51
00:03:53,121 --> 00:03:56,344
I just wanted you
to understand how you're gonna die.

52
00:04:00,632 --> 00:04:02,536
You think I believe you people?

53
00:04:02,783 --> 00:04:04,063
You think I trust you,

54
00:04:04,098 --> 00:04:06,023
that I'm gonna just do the surgery

55
00:04:06,082 --> 00:04:07,878
and hope that you let me go?

56
00:04:09,679 --> 00:04:10,713
Don't!

57
00:04:22,918 --> 00:04:24,050
Well, Jack,

58
00:04:24,902 --> 00:04:26,977
I'm very disappointed in your decision.

59
00:04:31,368 --> 00:04:32,422
Well, Ben,

60
00:04:33,456 --> 00:04:36,526
at least you won't have
to be disappointed for very long.

3x06 - I Do

64
00:04:59,664 --> 00:05:01,413
You shouldn't have come here.

65
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:05,188
Yeah, you're right.

66
00:05:06,737 --> 00:05:07,947
I've made a huge mistake.

67
00:05:08,041 --> 00:05:09,952
I am just full of regret right now.

68
00:05:10,187 --> 00:05:11,337
Seriously.

69
00:05:12,523 --> 00:05:15,183
it's bad luck to see the bride
before the wedding.

70
00:05:16,368 --> 00:05:19,761
It's bad luck to see the bride
in her dress before the wedding.

71
00:05:20,571 --> 00:05:21,964
You, my friend, are naked.

72
00:05:26,285 --> 00:05:27,527
Have you tried it on?

73
00:05:28,044 --> 00:05:29,476
I have to hold my breath

74
00:05:29,523 --> 00:05:31,786
to get the claspy things to clasp,

75
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:35,600
so I'm waiting
till the absolute last minute.

76
00:05:35,645 --> 00:05:38,186
It's in about 12 hours.
You might wanna get clasping.

77
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:51,846
I know it's...

78
00:05:53,842 --> 00:05:55,263
It's been fast,

79
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:58,548
but... this is right.

80
00:06:01,091 --> 00:06:02,406
I know it's real...

81
00:06:05,978 --> 00:06:07,551
and I love you, Monica.

82
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:11,782
I love you too, Kevin.

83
00:06:26,503 --> 00:06:29,154
Come on. Time for work.

84
00:06:33,972 --> 00:06:36,207
- What about him?
- He's got the day off.

85
00:06:38,168 --> 00:06:39,852
Well, if he's not working, neither am I.

86
00:06:39,922 --> 00:06:42,190
- Oh, you're not?
- Just go, Freckles.

87
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,797
Man wants to give me a day off,

88
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:46,549
let him give me a day off.

89
00:06:47,323 --> 00:06:49,460
No, Sawyer. We're a team.

90
00:06:49,977 --> 00:06:51,934
You break the rocks, I haul 'em.

91
00:06:53,284 --> 00:06:54,283
All right.

92
00:06:54,803 --> 00:06:55,824
Fine.

93
00:07:06,784 --> 00:07:09,623
Lord knows I wouldn't want
to break up the team.

94
00:07:36,334 --> 00:07:37,802
What happened to him?

95
00:07:38,824 --> 00:07:40,303
Must have been an animal,

96
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:41,777
maybe one of the bears.

97
00:07:41,930 --> 00:07:43,558
Are we gonna carry him back?

98
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,652
We're gonna bury him here.

99
00:07:48,207 --> 00:07:49,228
Are we?

100
00:07:49,264 --> 00:07:50,602
The people back at camp...

101
00:07:50,919 --> 00:07:53,608
there's just been
a few too many funerals lately.

102
00:07:54,136 --> 00:07:55,911
Nobody needs to see him like this.

103
00:07:55,958 --> 00:07:58,107
I'll slip back to the beach
and get a couple shovels.

104
00:07:58,142 --> 00:07:59,129
I'll come with you.

105
00:07:59,164 --> 00:08:02,305
- No, I'll be back in an hour...
- it's not safe to go alone, John.

106
00:08:06,884 --> 00:08:08,515
I appreciate your concern.

107
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,683
So what killed Eko?

108
00:08:24,243 --> 00:08:26,749
Folks back at the beach
call it the "monster."

109
00:08:27,384 --> 00:08:29,559
I don't really have a name for it.

110
00:08:30,909 --> 00:08:32,563
You don't believe in monsters.

111
00:08:32,746 --> 00:08:34,502
I believe in what I can see.

112
00:08:36,369 --> 00:08:37,942
But obviously, you have.

113
00:08:40,346 --> 00:08:42,580
So why don't you tell me
what you think it is?

114
00:08:42,684 --> 00:08:44,104
It might be what brought us here.

115
00:08:44,186 --> 00:08:47,470
So you believe that this monster
decided that Eko was meant to die?

116
00:08:47,493 --> 00:08:49,402
I believe Eko died for a reason.

117
00:08:50,564 --> 00:08:52,163
I just don't know what it is yet.

118
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:55,395
Is that why you lied?

119
00:08:56,992 --> 00:08:59,527
We're not headed back towards the camp,
are we, John?

120
00:09:01,007 --> 00:09:02,169
Sure, we are.

121
00:09:02,486 --> 00:09:04,675
Just need to take a little detour first.

122
00:09:15,656 --> 00:09:17,065
<i>Compound breach.</i>

123
00:09:17,558 --> 00:09:18,896
<i>Compound breach.</i>

124
00:09:18,943 --> 00:09:19,953
Where is she?

125
00:09:20,094 --> 00:09:22,561
Someone's on the grid.
I want him on the ground, her too.

126
00:09:22,642 --> 00:09:24,002
If he moves, you shoot him.

127
00:09:26,198 --> 00:09:27,772
- Yeah, they're here.
<i>- Okay.</i>

128
00:09:27,819 --> 00:09:29,521
Did the doctor get out again?

129
00:09:29,827 --> 00:09:30,907
You sure?

130
00:09:31,353 --> 00:09:32,645
Well, does he know?

131
00:09:33,408 --> 00:09:35,151
How the hell did she get over here?!

132
00:09:38,327 --> 00:09:40,277
Get up! Come on! Get up! Go!

133
00:09:40,430 --> 00:09:41,897
Alex!

134
00:09:42,672 --> 00:09:44,550
What the hell do you think you're doing?

135
00:09:44,644 --> 00:09:45,759
What, you gonna shoot me?

136
00:09:45,877 --> 00:09:48,380
You know you're not supposed to be here,
so let's just calm...

137
00:09:48,403 --> 00:09:50,071
what did you do to him, Danny?!

138
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,221
Where is he?

139
00:09:51,959 --> 00:09:53,297
I want to talk to Ben.

140
00:09:53,414 --> 00:09:54,448
Sure.

141
00:09:54,906 --> 00:09:56,697
That sounds like a great idea.

142
00:09:56,932 --> 00:09:58,866
So why don't we just
lower our little sling--

143
00:09:58,913 --> 00:10:00,181
where is he? Tell me!

144
00:10:00,534 --> 00:10:02,412
Don't-- no! Get off of me!

145
00:10:03,084 --> 00:10:04,974
- Get her out of here.
- What do I do with her?

146
00:10:04,998 --> 00:10:06,462
- Get her outta here!
- Put me down!

147
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:08,941
Listen, whatever they say,
don't believe them.

148
00:10:09,788 --> 00:10:11,139
They're gonna kill your boyfriend

149
00:10:11,984 --> 00:10:13,184
just like they killed mine.

150
00:10:29,476 --> 00:10:30,515
I don't understand.

151
00:10:30,574 --> 00:10:33,157
- It's supposed to be two weeks.
- Our schedule's been moved up.

152
00:10:33,169 --> 00:10:34,927
- Is that an order?
- It's coming from him.

153
00:10:34,974 --> 00:10:36,659
- That's stupid.
- It's not my call.

154
00:10:36,742 --> 00:10:38,188
That's the way it is, Danny.

155
00:10:40,712 --> 00:10:42,051
All right.

156
00:10:43,930 --> 00:10:47,211
I would like for you to put this on
and come with me, please.

157
00:10:49,008 --> 00:10:51,768
You think I'm gonna put a hood
over my head 'cause you said "please"?

158
00:10:51,791 --> 00:10:53,945
No, I think you're going
to put a hood over your head

159
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:55,765
because the man standing behind me,

160
00:10:55,857 --> 00:10:58,032
the one
who's burning a hole in my back--

161
00:10:59,066 --> 00:11:00,840
that man is going to kill Sawyer.

162
00:11:01,827 --> 00:11:04,242
But if you put this on
and you come with me,

163
00:11:04,313 --> 00:11:07,486
there's something you can do for us
that will save his life.

164
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:51,931
Come in.

165
00:11:55,415 --> 00:11:56,965
Oh, sweetheart.

166
00:11:57,470 --> 00:11:58,890
You're beautiful.

167
00:12:00,816 --> 00:12:02,585
Absolutely beautiful.

168
00:12:05,192 --> 00:12:06,225
How is it out there?

169
00:12:06,258 --> 00:12:08,266
There are a lot of excited policemen.

170
00:12:10,098 --> 00:12:11,300
Don't worry. I have asked them

171
00:12:11,335 --> 00:12:14,213
not to shoot their guns in the air
when you say "I do."

172
00:12:15,634 --> 00:12:18,559
You know, mothers-in-law
aren't supposed to be so nice.

173
00:12:22,647 --> 00:12:23,798
Monica...

174
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,817
I have something for you.

175
00:12:29,392 --> 00:12:31,024
Suzanne, you shouldn't have.

176
00:12:31,118 --> 00:12:33,457
My mother gave that to me
on my wedding day.

177
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:38,049
She told me someday
I'd give it to my daughter,

178
00:12:38,319 --> 00:12:40,961
but since I had four boys...

179
00:12:43,706 --> 00:12:44,716
here.

180
00:13:01,922 --> 00:13:03,178
It's perfect.

181
00:13:05,699 --> 00:13:07,648
You know,
Kevin's been coming to the church here

182
00:13:07,683 --> 00:13:09,327
since he was about yea high.

183
00:13:10,498 --> 00:13:12,169
When I first met you, Monica,

184
00:13:12,392 --> 00:13:14,037
I was struck by your honesty

185
00:13:14,201 --> 00:13:15,540
and devotion to Kevin.

186
00:13:16,916 --> 00:13:19,044
And when I asked him
what he loved most about you,

187
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:20,109
he said,

188
00:13:20,261 --> 00:13:22,328
"because what you see is what you get."

189
00:13:23,244 --> 00:13:24,534
That being said,

190
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:26,424
we've got the rings,

191
00:13:27,293 --> 00:13:28,643
you've vowed your vows,

192
00:13:29,571 --> 00:13:30,921
and I now pronounce you

193
00:13:31,144 --> 00:13:32,591
husband and wife.

194
00:14:17,743 --> 00:14:18,734
Watch the Step.

195
00:14:58,622 --> 00:15:00,325
I'll give you two some privacy.

196
00:15:09,612 --> 00:15:10,657
You okay?

197
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,960
Yeah. You?

198
00:15:15,736 --> 00:15:16,875
Yeah, I'm...

199
00:15:17,932 --> 00:15:18,953
I'm great.

200
00:15:21,243 --> 00:15:22,651
Where are they keeping you?

201
00:15:24,463 --> 00:15:26,765
Outside, in a cage.

202
00:15:29,727 --> 00:15:30,830
Sawyer?

203
00:15:31,349 --> 00:15:32,664
He's in a cage, too.

204
00:15:35,364 --> 00:15:36,726
They're making us work.

205
00:15:37,766 --> 00:15:39,492
Work? On what?

206
00:15:40,042 --> 00:15:41,427
I don't know what it is,

207
00:15:41,568 --> 00:15:42,719
but it's big.

208
00:15:47,154 --> 00:15:48,540
We're hauling rocks and--

209
00:15:51,874 --> 00:15:53,048
Did they hurt you?

210
00:16:01,628 --> 00:16:03,850
Hey, it's gonna...
it's gonna be all right.

211
00:16:04,624 --> 00:16:05,740
It's gonna--

212
00:16:06,909 --> 00:16:10,055
Jack, you have to do it.

213
00:16:11,574 --> 00:16:13,523
- What?
- This thing that they told you to do...

214
00:16:13,558 --> 00:16:14,703
this operation.

215
00:16:18,126 --> 00:16:19,477
She said that if you do it,

216
00:16:19,524 --> 00:16:21,610
- then that they would...
- What did they do to you?

217
00:16:21,657 --> 00:16:23,397
- What did they do to you?
- Nothing.

218
00:16:23,432 --> 00:16:24,747
How did they get you to ask me?

219
00:16:24,782 --> 00:16:26,307
What did they offer you?

220
00:16:26,330 --> 00:16:28,067
- Nothing.
- Then what are you doing here?

221
00:16:28,134 --> 00:16:29,907
They're gonna kill Sawyer!

222
00:16:35,449 --> 00:16:36,729
I'm sorry.

223
00:16:40,523 --> 00:16:43,121
I'm so sorry,
but she said that if you do it,

224
00:16:43,179 --> 00:16:45,344
and if you do it soon,
they'll let us go.

225
00:16:46,576 --> 00:16:47,821
And you believe them?

226
00:16:51,887 --> 00:16:53,190
I have to.

227
00:17:03,981 --> 00:17:05,144
Please.

228
00:17:06,788 --> 00:17:08,009
We're done here.

229
00:17:12,225 --> 00:17:13,563
<i>We're done in here!</i>

230
00:17:14,336 --> 00:17:16,614
<i>Jack, I'm sorry.</i>

231
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:18,995
<i>You have to do this.</i>

232
00:17:19,014 --> 00:17:20,451
<i>They said that they couldn't--</i>

233
00:17:24,892 --> 00:17:26,371
Get her out of there.

234
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:31,918
<i>Jack, please!</i>

235
00:17:48,232 --> 00:17:49,242
Hey, you.

236
00:17:49,536 --> 00:17:51,144
Hey, what's for dinner, gorgeous?

237
00:17:51,332 --> 00:17:52,612
It's taco night.

238
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:54,056
You're making tacos?

239
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:57,482
Yes, and you better like 'em.

240
00:17:58,521 --> 00:17:59,531
Or what?

241
00:17:59,730 --> 00:18:01,057
Or no dessert.

242
00:18:02,448 --> 00:18:04,444
I'm leaving now. I'll be home soon.

243
00:18:04,817 --> 00:18:06,937
- Love you.
- I love you, too.

244
00:18:38,298 --> 00:18:39,286
Agent Mars.

245
00:18:40,847 --> 00:18:41,887
It's me.

246
00:18:51,314 --> 00:18:52,489
Well, I'm glad.

247
00:18:53,741 --> 00:18:55,698
I realized this morning
that it was the feast of

248
00:18:55,737 --> 00:18:57,239
<i>the ascension,
and I was feeling bad.</i>

249
00:18:57,278 --> 00:18:58,262
<i>A lot of holy days</i>

250
00:18:58,310 --> 00:19:00,044
have come and gone
since you last called.

251
00:19:00,111 --> 00:19:01,462
I thought you and I were friends.

252
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:02,983
I don't want to run anymore.

253
00:19:03,966 --> 00:19:05,121
What's his name?

254
00:19:09,498 --> 00:19:11,097
Does he know who you are?

255
00:19:12,775 --> 00:19:14,007
Edward, please.

256
00:19:14,897 --> 00:19:18,082
I know you don't want to spend
the rest of your life chasing me.

257
00:19:18,391 --> 00:19:19,816
Please, I love this guy.

258
00:19:20,625 --> 00:19:21,704
Just let me go.

259
00:19:23,052 --> 00:19:24,265
I'll tell you what.

260
00:19:27,405 --> 00:19:28,998
If you can really stay put,

261
00:19:30,809 --> 00:19:32,183
you really settle down,

262
00:19:34,032 --> 00:19:35,332
then I'll stop chasing you.

263
00:19:42,785 --> 00:19:44,898
But you and I both know
that's not gonna happen.

264
00:20:08,014 --> 00:20:09,054
Sawyer...

265
00:20:11,577 --> 00:20:13,236
You really care about him, huh?

266
00:20:14,526 --> 00:20:15,644
Where is he?

267
00:20:17,749 --> 00:20:20,064
I'm sorry
you weren't able to help us, Kate.

268
00:20:20,592 --> 00:20:21,684
Move it, Ford.

269
00:20:36,468 --> 00:20:37,466
Danny.

270
00:20:38,561 --> 00:20:39,700
Son of a bitch!

271
00:20:44,268 --> 00:20:45,477
Right. Sorry, Jules.

272
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:50,688
You got anything
you wanna say to your girl,

273
00:20:51,521 --> 00:20:53,048
you'd best say it tonight.

274
00:21:12,744 --> 00:21:14,247
And how was your day, honey?

275
00:21:17,711 --> 00:21:19,085
When the hatch exploded,

276
00:21:19,590 --> 00:21:22,599
your prayer stick fell out of a tree
right on top of me.

277
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:25,230
So Sayid and I went out to get it,

278
00:21:25,289 --> 00:21:28,007
because it didn't feel right
to bury you without it.

279
00:21:29,686 --> 00:21:32,519
I'd like to think you died for a reason,
Mr. Eko.

280
00:21:34,101 --> 00:21:35,371
Just hope it's not too long

281
00:21:35,372 --> 00:21:37,581
before we find out
what the heck it might be.

282
00:21:51,071 --> 00:21:53,866
Rest in peace, Mr. Eko.

283
00:21:56,219 --> 00:21:58,338
Thank you for helping me find my...

284
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:18,247
I saw Jack.

285
00:22:22,528 --> 00:22:24,070
They brought me in to see him.

286
00:22:25,916 --> 00:22:27,788
They want him to do surgery on Ben.

287
00:22:27,835 --> 00:22:28,856
Who the hell's Ben?

288
00:22:28,915 --> 00:22:30,681
Henry, the guy who brought us in.

289
00:22:31,914 --> 00:22:32,984
He's sick.

290
00:22:33,054 --> 00:22:35,523
And they say that if he does it,
they're gonna let us all go.

291
00:22:35,570 --> 00:22:36,720
And you and me are what,

292
00:22:36,779 --> 00:22:38,449
- bait?
- Somethin' like that.

293
00:22:40,821 --> 00:22:43,173
At least
the doc ain't dumb enough to do it.

294
00:22:44,238 --> 00:22:45,506
I told him he had to.

295
00:22:47,542 --> 00:22:49,580
Why the hell
would you do something so stupid?

296
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,691
To save your life.

297
00:22:50,726 --> 00:22:52,610
My life don't need saving.

298
00:22:52,657 --> 00:22:53,867
You wanna die?!

299
00:22:54,102 --> 00:22:55,924
'Cause that's what's gonna happen.

300
00:22:57,145 --> 00:22:58,982
Pickett is just waiting for his chance.

301
00:22:59,006 --> 00:23:00,309
I've seen him look at you.

302
00:23:00,356 --> 00:23:01,856
Damn it, Freckles, stay put.

303
00:23:02,352 --> 00:23:04,057
And you know what he's gonna do.

304
00:23:04,456 --> 00:23:05,654
So don't pretend

305
00:23:06,922 --> 00:23:08,120
like you don't care.

306
00:23:08,311 --> 00:23:10,295
Get down, Freckles!
We already been through this.

307
00:23:10,371 --> 00:23:11,522
Shut up, James.

308
00:23:18,859 --> 00:23:20,577
You don't want Jack to save your life?

309
00:23:20,647 --> 00:23:22,134
Then you're gonna save your own.

310
00:23:22,512 --> 00:23:24,006
We're getting outta here now.

311
00:23:24,828 --> 00:23:26,061
Stop it! Damn it, Kate.

312
00:23:30,596 --> 00:23:32,651
Go. Get outta here. Run!

313
00:23:32,698 --> 00:23:33,931
You're out of your cage.

314
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:35,481
Why don't you run, Kate?

315
00:23:36,062 --> 00:23:37,224
'Cause me...

316
00:23:37,377 --> 00:23:38,551
I ain't running...

317
00:23:40,266 --> 00:23:42,148
'cause there ain't no place to go.

318
00:23:44,848 --> 00:23:46,465
What are you talking about?

319
00:23:47,538 --> 00:23:48,853
We ain't on our island.

320
00:23:49,992 --> 00:23:52,236
We're on another island, like Alcatraz,

321
00:23:52,295 --> 00:23:53,575
couple miles offshore.

322
00:23:54,831 --> 00:23:56,156
So unless you're a mermaid,

323
00:23:56,203 --> 00:23:57,236
or you got a boat,

324
00:23:58,621 --> 00:23:59,948
there ain't no point.

325
00:24:00,911 --> 00:24:03,193
When were you planning
on telling me this?

326
00:24:03,610 --> 00:24:05,190
- Never.
- Why not?!

327
00:24:05,765 --> 00:24:06,833
Why wouldn't you?!

328
00:24:12,306 --> 00:24:13,839
'cause I wanted you to believe

329
00:24:13,881 --> 00:24:15,443
that we had a damn chance.

330
00:24:38,312 --> 00:24:39,404
What was that for?

331
00:24:40,413 --> 00:24:41,482
I don't know.

332
00:24:47,615 --> 00:24:48,636
I don't know.

333
00:25:58,228 --> 00:25:59,236
Very nice.

334
00:26:01,499 --> 00:26:03,061
Okay, now it's your turn.

335
00:26:04,846 --> 00:26:06,095
Look under your place mat.

336
00:26:07,551 --> 00:26:09,416
- What did you do?
- Just look.

337
00:26:11,635 --> 00:26:12,621
What is it?

338
00:26:12,656 --> 00:26:15,386
You know that honeymoon
I've been promising you for six months?

339
00:26:15,515 --> 00:26:18,473
You are holding in your hand
two tickets to Costa Rica.

340
00:26:18,875 --> 00:26:20,822
So get your passport ready, baby.

341
00:26:27,267 --> 00:26:28,359
What's wrong?

342
00:26:30,198 --> 00:26:31,278
Nothing.

343
00:26:33,425 --> 00:26:35,175
I just love you so much.

344
00:26:39,314 --> 00:26:40,406
Come here.

345
00:27:11,959 --> 00:27:13,452
Let me ask you something.

346
00:27:17,623 --> 00:27:19,777
The day blockhead was beating on me,

347
00:27:20,265 --> 00:27:21,414
and you said...

348
00:27:22,811 --> 00:27:23,927
"I love you."

349
00:27:24,502 --> 00:27:25,571
That was just...

350
00:27:27,825 --> 00:27:29,196
to get him to stop, right?

351
00:28:05,029 --> 00:28:06,238
I love you, too.

352
00:28:36,469 --> 00:28:37,545
Who is this?

353
00:28:39,412 --> 00:28:40,428
Hello?

354
00:28:46,035 --> 00:28:47,584
<i>Try it... the door.</i>

355
00:30:21,985 --> 00:30:24,064
If it helps, I was surprised, too.

356
00:30:26,557 --> 00:30:28,749
If I were a betting man,
I would have picked

357
00:30:28,825 --> 00:30:30,271
- her and you.
- Shut up!

358
00:30:34,432 --> 00:30:35,441
Well,

359
00:30:36,533 --> 00:30:37,673
I suppose this would be

360
00:30:37,708 --> 00:30:40,268
the proverbial nail in my coffin,
wouldn't it?

361
00:30:49,945 --> 00:30:51,043
Tomorrow.

362
00:30:52,657 --> 00:30:53,725
Sorry?

363
00:30:53,889 --> 00:30:55,699
Tomorrow morning, first thing.

364
00:30:58,743 --> 00:31:00,786
Get everything I mentioned before,

365
00:31:01,491 --> 00:31:02,501
the instruments,

366
00:31:02,572 --> 00:31:05,524
the anesthesia, and someone
who can hold a damn clamp.

367
00:31:05,794 --> 00:31:07,755
- Of course.
- I'll get it out...

368
00:31:08,025 --> 00:31:09,129
your tumor,

369
00:31:09,904 --> 00:31:11,310
and I'll keep you alive.

370
00:31:18,067 --> 00:31:19,288
But I need your word.

371
00:31:21,221 --> 00:31:23,052
I need what you promised me before.

372
00:31:25,271 --> 00:31:27,346
I need to get the hell off this island.

373
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:34,922
Done.

374
00:32:33,908 --> 00:32:34,987
What you working on?

375
00:32:35,105 --> 00:32:38,376
Just finishing some I.R.S
on that fugitive recovery out of Tampa.

376
00:32:38,643 --> 00:32:40,865
That's what being a cop is...
just endless paperwork.

377
00:32:40,912 --> 00:32:42,063
Thank you, sweetie.

378
00:32:49,326 --> 00:32:51,282
What if I told you I was a fugitive?

379
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:58,839
What if I told you I was on the run
for blowing up my father,

380
00:32:58,944 --> 00:33:01,329
and it was only a matter of time
before you found out?

381
00:33:03,254 --> 00:33:05,502
- This isn't funny.
- It's not a joke.

382
00:33:07,276 --> 00:33:08,850
I almost had a baby, Kev.

383
00:33:09,589 --> 00:33:10,998
Me. A baby.

384
00:33:13,159 --> 00:33:14,580
I can't do this.

385
00:33:15,296 --> 00:33:16,365
Taco night?

386
00:33:16,447 --> 00:33:17,725
I don't do taco night!

387
00:33:17,772 --> 00:33:19,096
Calm down, Monica.

388
00:33:19,131 --> 00:33:20,587
My name's not Monica!

389
00:33:28,518 --> 00:33:29,563
I love you...

390
00:33:32,527 --> 00:33:33,713
but I can't stay.

391
00:33:38,729 --> 00:33:39,997
Wait. Hang on.

392
00:33:43,851 --> 00:33:46,097
- Kev...
- Something's wrong with me.

393
00:33:46,167 --> 00:33:47,210
I drugged you.

394
00:33:47,925 --> 00:33:49,392
- You what?
- I had to.

395
00:33:49,486 --> 00:33:51,280
Otherwise, they would think you knew.

396
00:33:51,596 --> 00:33:53,486
People are gonna be asking
a lot of questions,

397
00:33:53,522 --> 00:33:56,363
and I didn't want you
to lose your job. Kev!

398
00:34:36,834 --> 00:34:38,773
This is gonna be
a very tricky procedure.

399
00:34:38,990 --> 00:34:41,644
If I tell you to do something,
I need you to do it then and there,

400
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:42,683
no questions asked.

401
00:34:43,365 --> 00:34:44,480
Is that understood?

402
00:34:45,404 --> 00:34:46,743
You may find this hard to believe,

403
00:34:46,778 --> 00:34:49,469
but I've always been very good
at just following orders.

404
00:34:51,735 --> 00:34:52,792
Is that a yes?

405
00:34:54,177 --> 00:34:55,152
Yes.

406
00:34:56,373 --> 00:34:57,395
Good.

407
00:34:58,974 --> 00:35:00,066
Let's go.

408
00:35:10,668 --> 00:35:12,042
Do you get nervous...

409
00:35:14,461 --> 00:35:15,774
before you do surgery?

410
00:35:16,439 --> 00:35:17,507
I used to,

411
00:35:18,304 --> 00:35:19,502
but not anymore, no.

412
00:35:31,457 --> 00:35:32,490
Whatever happens,

413
00:35:33,588 --> 00:35:36,018
everything will be very different,
won't it?

414
00:35:36,769 --> 00:35:37,920
No doubt about it.

415
00:35:43,550 --> 00:35:44,572
Juliet...

416
00:35:47,042 --> 00:35:48,498
did Alex ask about me?

417
00:35:50,910 --> 00:35:52,392
We took her home last night.

418
00:35:53,003 --> 00:35:54,749
I don't know where she is now.

419
00:35:55,849 --> 00:35:57,959
Well, see you on the other side.

420
00:36:05,174 --> 00:36:06,289
I'm ready.

421
00:36:07,757 --> 00:36:09,706
I need you to count down from 20.

422
00:36:11,690 --> 00:36:12,747
20...

423
00:36:13,901 --> 00:36:15,052
19...

424
00:36:17,177 --> 00:36:18,187
eight...

425
00:36:22,896 --> 00:36:23,882
Scalpel.

426
00:36:41,017 --> 00:36:42,169
Let's go.

427
00:36:45,386 --> 00:36:46,603
Ben's just gone into surgery.

428
00:36:46,650 --> 00:36:49,022
Ben just put his life
in the hands of one of them.

429
00:36:50,231 --> 00:36:52,352
Shephard wasn't even on Jacob's list.

430
00:36:56,239 --> 00:36:58,856
Well, well, well,
look who got out of her cage.

431
00:36:59,091 --> 00:37:01,378
You two should've run
when you had the chance.

432
00:37:01,437 --> 00:37:03,319
- Let's go, James.
- Don't. Please.

433
00:37:03,353 --> 00:37:04,441
You don't have to do this.

434
00:37:04,470 --> 00:37:06,791
He's coming with me,
and you can do anything about it!

435
00:37:06,826 --> 00:37:07,918
Step away.

436
00:37:14,106 --> 00:37:15,585
Give me another hemostat.

437
00:37:34,304 --> 00:37:35,396
Swab again.

438
00:37:40,694 --> 00:37:41,703
Clamp.

439
00:38:02,456 --> 00:38:03,889
What happened? Is he okay?

440
00:38:03,948 --> 00:38:05,741
His blood pressure's dropping.

441
00:38:06,481 --> 00:38:09,076
- Should he be bleeding like that?
- No. No, he shouldn't.

442
00:38:11,998 --> 00:38:13,392
Back away from the table.

443
00:38:13,485 --> 00:38:15,387
Back away from the table now!

444
00:38:28,636 --> 00:38:29,767
Can you hear me in there?

445
00:38:32,026 --> 00:38:33,047
Good.

446
00:38:33,684 --> 00:38:36,393
I just made a small incision
in Ben's kidney sack.

447
00:38:37,114 --> 00:38:40,167
Now if I don't stitch
that back up in the next hour,

448
00:38:41,283 --> 00:38:42,445
he's dead.

449
00:38:46,285 --> 00:38:48,689
Now get in here
and bring that walkie-talkie!

450
00:38:49,687 --> 00:38:50,685
Step away!

451
00:39:04,369 --> 00:39:06,377
You let go, or I do her, too.

452
00:39:09,089 --> 00:39:10,158
Let go!

453
00:39:10,263 --> 00:39:11,501
Don't you let go!

454
00:39:14,190 --> 00:39:16,566
Don't even think about it, Sawyer.
You fight!

455
00:39:25,079 --> 00:39:26,464
Sawyer, please!

456
00:39:26,593 --> 00:39:28,214
You get your hands off of him!

457
00:39:28,296 --> 00:39:29,529
Down on your knees!

458
00:39:31,619 --> 00:39:32,687
Please!

459
00:39:33,110 --> 00:39:34,671
I'll do anything you want!

460
00:39:34,706 --> 00:39:36,068
I want you to watch.

461
00:39:37,894 --> 00:39:39,279
Close your eyes, Freckles.

462
00:39:39,345 --> 00:39:40,320
Stand up.

463
00:39:40,602 --> 00:39:41,858
Close your eyes!

464
00:39:45,664 --> 00:39:47,050
Don't you give up!

465
00:39:52,826 --> 00:39:54,294
This is for Colleen,

466
00:39:54,775 --> 00:39:56,231
you son of a bitch!

467
00:40:06,647 --> 00:40:07,810
<i>Danny, are you there?</i>

468
00:40:07,883 --> 00:40:09,855
<i>Pick it up. Pick it up, Danny.</i>

469
00:40:09,988 --> 00:40:11,245
<i>Pick it up, damn it!</i>

470
00:40:13,099 --> 00:40:14,567
I'm here! What?!

471
00:40:14,719 --> 00:40:16,340
<i>You anywhere near the cages?</i>

472
00:40:17,426 --> 00:40:18,941
Yeah, you could say that.

473
00:40:19,012 --> 00:40:20,514
Give your walkie to Kate.

474
00:40:20,676 --> 00:40:22,742
Now why the hell would I do that?!

475
00:40:27,591 --> 00:40:28,883
Because if you don't,

476
00:40:29,094 --> 00:40:30,965
the doctor's gonna let Ben die.

477
00:40:31,071 --> 00:40:32,457
What are you talking about?

478
00:40:32,527 --> 00:40:33,561
What's that beeping?

479
00:40:33,590 --> 00:40:35,766
Just hand her the damn walkie, Danny.

480
00:40:39,588 --> 00:40:41,067
Do it! Just do it now!

481
00:40:48,739 --> 00:40:49,878
Let go of her!

482
00:41:08,823 --> 00:41:12,338
You have about an hour head start
before they come after you.

483
00:41:13,868 --> 00:41:15,324
Jack, where are you?

484
00:41:19,096 --> 00:41:21,041
You remember
what I told you on the beach?

485
00:41:21,658 --> 00:41:22,659
The day of the crash?

486
00:41:22,852 --> 00:41:23,977
Do you remember what story

487
00:41:23,978 --> 00:41:25,837
I told you
when you were stitching me up?

488
00:41:27,859 --> 00:41:30,594
- You remember it?
- Yes Jack, I remember.

489
00:41:34,774 --> 00:41:36,218
When you get safe...

490
00:41:36,411 --> 00:41:38,703
you radio me and you tell me that story.

491
00:41:40,918 --> 00:41:42,305
Jack, please...

492
00:41:45,608 --> 00:41:47,447
If don't get a call from you
in the next hour

493
00:41:47,505 --> 00:41:49,807
I'm gonna know something went wrong,
and he dies!

494
00:41:53,486 --> 00:41:54,904
I can't leave without you.

495
00:41:54,962 --> 00:41:56,290
It's time, go.

496
00:41:56,291 --> 00:41:58,429
- Jack, I can't...
- Go, now!

497
00:41:58,468 --> 00:42:01,665
- I can't!
- Kate, damn-it, run!
