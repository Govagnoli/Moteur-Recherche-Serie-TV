2
00:00:02,324 --> 00:00:03,947
Desmond said I was gonna die.

3
00:00:04,069 --> 00:00:06,724
He told me he has
these flashes... visions.

4
00:00:06,874 --> 00:00:09,961
When I saw the lightning hit the roof,
you were electrocuted.

5
00:00:10,083 --> 00:00:11,848
And when you heard
Claire was in the water,

6
00:00:11,878 --> 00:00:14,803
you drowned trying to save her.
I dove in myself, so you never went in.

7
00:00:14,925 --> 00:00:16,449
No matter what I try to do,

8
00:00:16,585 --> 00:00:18,002
you're gonna die, Charlie.

9
00:00:18,124 --> 00:00:19,478
There's a woman in Hurley's tent

10
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,468
who parachuted
onto the island yesterday.

11
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:24,558
She says that the boat she took off from
is about 80 miles off the coast,

12
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:27,650
and if she can find a way to contact it,
we'll all be rescued.

13
00:00:27,772 --> 00:00:29,078
Why didn't anyone tell me this?

14
00:00:29,282 --> 00:00:30,769
Because they don't trust you.

15
00:00:31,124 --> 00:00:32,209
<i>Kwon is pregnant.</i>

16
00:00:32,364 --> 00:00:33,364
Where'd you get that?

17
00:00:33,477 --> 00:00:35,811
You really think
you're in a position to ask questions?

18
00:00:35,835 --> 00:00:37,853
I told Jack what they were making me do.

19
00:00:38,022 --> 00:00:39,299
Why didn't you tell us?

20
00:00:39,522 --> 00:00:41,899
Because I hadn't decided
what to do about it yet.

21
00:01:17,811 --> 00:01:19,223
Anyone wants to venture a guess

22
00:01:19,348 --> 00:01:22,186
as to what Jack's gonna be showing us
out in the middle of nowhere?

23
00:01:22,497 --> 00:01:23,977
I don't know. Stuff.

24
00:01:25,122 --> 00:01:26,344
Probably secret stuff.

25
00:01:27,303 --> 00:01:29,250
Why does everything
have to be such a secret?

26
00:01:29,372 --> 00:01:31,233
How about some openness
for a change?

27
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:33,942
We kept the parachute lady secret.

28
00:01:34,064 --> 00:01:35,230
Ah, that's different.

29
00:01:35,375 --> 00:01:36,375
Different how?

30
00:01:36,873 --> 00:01:39,666
Well, because we weren't out there
playing football with them.

31
00:01:40,064 --> 00:01:41,064
What?

32
00:01:42,397 --> 00:01:43,436
Nothing.

33
00:01:43,562 --> 00:01:44,562
Wait.

34
00:01:46,169 --> 00:01:48,111
You had one of your flashes
again, didn't you?

35
00:01:48,874 --> 00:01:50,096
No, Charlie, I didn't.

36
00:01:53,747 --> 00:01:54,747
We're here.

37
00:02:07,249 --> 00:02:08,546
A couple of nights ago,

38
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:11,547
Juliet came to me,
and she told me everything...

39
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:15,857
That Ben had sent her here to find out
which of our women were pregnant.

40
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,721
So what, you guys
were doing tests on us?

41
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,166
No, but that's what he wanted me to do.

42
00:02:21,247 --> 00:02:24,249
I've been leaving tapes
at the medical station.

43
00:02:24,897 --> 00:02:26,248
You all heard what he said.

44
00:02:26,374 --> 00:02:27,707
They're coming tomorrow.

45
00:02:29,135 --> 00:02:31,861
Sun, I'm sorry that I lied to you.

46
00:02:33,062 --> 00:02:34,827
While I appreciate your honesty, Jack,

47
00:02:35,249 --> 00:02:37,434
it doesn't explain
why you brought us out here.

48
00:02:51,624 --> 00:02:52,624
Show 'em.

49
00:03:14,373 --> 00:03:16,399
When Juliet told me they where coming,

50
00:03:17,375 --> 00:03:18,960
the first thing I thought was,

51
00:03:19,788 --> 00:03:21,707
where the hell
are we gonna hide this time?

52
00:03:22,388 --> 00:03:23,717
But hiding's pointless.

53
00:03:23,935 --> 00:03:25,747
They're just gonna keep coming back.

54
00:03:26,748 --> 00:03:28,609
So I went out, and I found some help.

55
00:03:29,692 --> 00:03:30,739
And for the past few days,

56
00:03:30,861 --> 00:03:33,160
she's been bringing dynamite
back from "the black rock."

57
00:03:33,853 --> 00:03:34,889
For the very first time,

58
00:03:35,011 --> 00:03:38,156
we know exactly what they want,
when they're coming to get it,

59
00:03:38,309 --> 00:03:40,129
and they have no idea

60
00:03:41,267 --> 00:03:42,788
that we're gonna be waiting for 'em.

61
00:03:44,828 --> 00:03:47,259
So Juliet's gonna mark the tents
with the white rocks,

62
00:03:47,381 --> 00:03:48,573
just like she was told to,

63
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:52,403
but there's not gonna be
any pregnant women inside.

64
00:03:52,525 --> 00:03:54,741
There's gonna be plenty
of what we used on that tree.

65
00:03:56,002 --> 00:03:57,188
So tomorrow night...

66
00:03:58,578 --> 00:03:59,578
We stop hiding.

67
00:04:00,017 --> 00:04:01,062
We stop running.

68
00:04:01,184 --> 00:04:04,295
We stop living in fear of them,
because when they show up...

69
00:04:07,577 --> 00:04:09,410
we're gonna blow 'em all to hell.

70
00:04:10,761 --> 00:04:22,732
Subtitles: swsub.com

71
00:04:31,358 --> 00:04:32,358
Bloody hell!

72
00:04:32,919 --> 00:04:34,422
Why are we even doing this?

73
00:04:34,544 --> 00:04:35,544
Chin up, mate.

74
00:04:35,825 --> 00:04:37,608
- We're headlining.
- Headlining?

75
00:04:38,091 --> 00:04:39,442
We're playing Clitheroe...

76
00:04:39,669 --> 00:04:40,923
The arse end of nowhere.

77
00:04:41,045 --> 00:04:42,045
A gig's a gig.

78
00:04:42,422 --> 00:04:43,656
We're building our fan base.

79
00:04:43,798 --> 00:04:46,234
Will our fan base pay
for a new sodding tire?

80
00:04:46,548 --> 00:04:47,786
Only if we show up.

81
00:04:48,703 --> 00:04:50,701
So let's just get on with it, shall we?

82
00:04:51,570 --> 00:04:52,779
You know what, Liam?

83
00:04:52,941 --> 00:04:54,099
You get on with it.

84
00:04:54,295 --> 00:04:55,295
I quit.

85
00:04:55,733 --> 00:04:58,092
- You're giving up?
- There's nothing to give up on!

86
00:04:58,483 --> 00:05:01,480
We're broke! The album's not selling!
We're a bloody joke!

87
00:05:01,602 --> 00:05:02,669
Hey, shut it!

88
00:05:03,921 --> 00:05:04,921
Listen.

89
00:05:10,054 --> 00:05:11,155
That's us.

90
00:05:14,599 --> 00:05:15,757
We're on the radio!

91
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:20,488
That we are.

92
00:05:20,647 --> 00:05:22,400
We're on the bloody radio!

93
00:05:27,916 --> 00:05:29,327
I told you, baby brother!

94
00:05:29,449 --> 00:05:31,095
We're gonna be bloody rock stars.

95
00:05:38,446 --> 00:05:39,593
Can I ask you something?

96
00:05:43,149 --> 00:05:45,166
Who are you people
about to go to war with?

97
00:05:46,118 --> 00:05:47,466
Oh, that's a long story.

98
00:05:47,588 --> 00:05:49,074
Want to ask me something else?

99
00:05:49,857 --> 00:05:50,924
You having a laugh?

100
00:05:51,728 --> 00:05:52,835
Of course not.

101
00:05:53,142 --> 00:05:55,163
I'd never disrespect a fellow Mancunian.

102
00:05:56,118 --> 00:05:58,264
- You're from Manchester, then?
- I am.

103
00:05:58,464 --> 00:06:01,323
My band got its start at
the night and day bar on Oldham street.

104
00:06:01,891 --> 00:06:03,966
- What band?
- We were called Drive Shaft.

105
00:06:05,085 --> 00:06:06,362
Yeah. Yeah, I know you.

106
00:06:06,685 --> 00:06:08,486
We had our moment in the sun.

107
00:06:08,608 --> 00:06:10,016
No, not that... the crash.

108
00:06:10,397 --> 00:06:11,681
You're the dead rock star.

109
00:06:11,829 --> 00:06:14,213
They made a big deal out of you
when they found the plane.

110
00:06:14,521 --> 00:06:16,374
Huge memorial service, new album.

111
00:06:16,559 --> 00:06:17,561
There's a new album?

112
00:06:17,683 --> 00:06:19,454
Yeah. God, it was everywhere...

113
00:06:19,627 --> 00:06:20,966
A "greatest hits" thing.

114
00:06:26,777 --> 00:06:28,598
Hey, look on the bright side.

115
00:06:29,028 --> 00:06:30,583
You're not really dead, right?

116
00:06:32,464 --> 00:06:33,464
Yeah, right.

117
00:06:57,563 --> 00:06:58,731
We need more wire,

118
00:06:59,623 --> 00:07:01,709
so we can trigger these
from a safe distance.

119
00:07:01,831 --> 00:07:04,047
I can get people to start
stripping the plane wreckage.

120
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:06,918
Good. I should be able
to finish rigging these tents

121
00:07:07,078 --> 00:07:08,327
in the next 24 hours.

122
00:07:08,843 --> 00:07:10,535
We'll be ready by tomorrow night.

123
00:07:16,495 --> 00:07:18,067
We need to talk about Naomi's phone.

124
00:07:18,189 --> 00:07:19,959
- Not now.
- If you're angry I doubted you,

125
00:07:20,081 --> 00:07:22,105
I'd be happy to make
a sincere apology later,

126
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:24,994
- but now we have a means...
- Look, I'm a little bit busy right now.

127
00:07:25,116 --> 00:07:27,477
And I am trying to get us
off this island!

128
00:07:31,473 --> 00:07:32,872
I can't transmit using this phone

129
00:07:32,994 --> 00:07:35,775
because Danielle's distress signal
is overriding the frequency.

130
00:07:37,082 --> 00:07:38,778
If you tell me where the radio tower is,

131
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:41,393
I can go there, switch off
your message and call for help.

132
00:07:41,529 --> 00:07:43,983
My signal has been playing
for the last 16 years,

133
00:07:44,105 --> 00:07:45,251
and nobody has heard it.

134
00:07:45,399 --> 00:07:47,154
Why do you think
you'll have better luck?

135
00:07:47,276 --> 00:07:50,601
Naomi's boat is only 80 miles offshore.

136
00:07:51,572 --> 00:07:53,983
I know if we eliminate
Danielle's signal, they'll hear us.

137
00:07:54,028 --> 00:07:55,090
No, they won't.

138
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:56,900
And why is that?

139
00:07:57,988 --> 00:07:59,032
We're jamming it.

140
00:07:59,458 --> 00:08:00,458
What?

141
00:08:00,536 --> 00:08:02,210
Ben is using one of the Dharma stations

142
00:08:02,235 --> 00:08:04,749
to block all of the signals off
of the island except for ours.

143
00:08:04,775 --> 00:08:05,775
What station?

144
00:08:06,151 --> 00:08:07,754
They call it the "Looking Glass."

145
00:08:08,552 --> 00:08:09,886
- The looking glass?
- Yes.

146
00:08:10,008 --> 00:08:12,163
But it's underwater.
I have no idea where it is.

147
00:08:14,525 --> 00:08:15,525
I believe I do.

148
00:08:17,714 --> 00:08:19,654
Look, I know...
I know Jack thinks it's best,

149
00:08:19,776 --> 00:08:22,270
but, you know, what if
they're coming for him again?

150
00:08:24,776 --> 00:08:25,942
Claire, listen to me.

151
00:08:26,775 --> 00:08:27,997
I'm gonna protect you.

152
00:08:28,527 --> 00:08:29,983
I'm gonna protect Aaron.

153
00:08:31,419 --> 00:08:32,526
I promise.

154
00:08:33,410 --> 00:08:35,415
Look, everything is gonna be fine.

155
00:08:40,498 --> 00:08:41,509
Sorry.

156
00:08:43,726 --> 00:08:45,345
Can you give me a hand with something?

157
00:08:47,853 --> 00:08:48,909
Of course.

158
00:09:01,888 --> 00:09:04,272
So you ready to tell me
what you saw this morning?

159
00:09:05,087 --> 00:09:06,087
Aye.

160
00:09:07,338 --> 00:09:09,631
Right. So how does it happen this time?

161
00:09:13,589 --> 00:09:14,589
Come on, Des!

162
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:16,664
You can tell me. I can take it.

163
00:09:21,828 --> 00:09:23,328
What I saw, Charlie, was...

164
00:09:24,951 --> 00:09:27,130
Claire and her baby
getting into a helicopter...

165
00:09:28,266 --> 00:09:29,377
A helicopter that...

166
00:09:31,078 --> 00:09:33,690
That lifts off, leaves this island.

167
00:09:39,951 --> 00:09:40,951
You sure?

168
00:09:41,517 --> 00:09:42,517
Aye.

169
00:09:43,017 --> 00:09:44,128
Rescue helicopter...

170
00:09:44,701 --> 00:09:45,701
On this beach?

171
00:09:46,015 --> 00:09:47,507
This island? That's what you saw?

172
00:09:49,951 --> 00:09:51,562
We're getting bloody rescued!

173
00:09:52,118 --> 00:09:54,491
I thought you were gonna tell me
I was gonna die again.

174
00:09:59,889 --> 00:10:00,889
You are, Charlie.

175
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:04,451
Wait. What?

176
00:10:06,081 --> 00:10:07,200
If you don't...

177
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,649
none of it will happen.

178
00:10:11,671 --> 00:10:13,115
There won't be any rescue.

179
00:10:16,607 --> 00:10:17,708
I'm sorry, brother...

180
00:10:18,966 --> 00:10:19,978
but this time...

181
00:10:23,097 --> 00:10:24,697
This time you have to die.

182
00:10:33,897 --> 00:10:34,953
Come on!

183
00:10:39,446 --> 00:10:41,592
Come on, Charlie. Jump in!

184
00:10:42,251 --> 00:10:43,584
I'm gonna catch you, boy.

185
00:10:44,687 --> 00:10:46,766
No. You're just going to back away.

186
00:10:46,972 --> 00:10:48,660
Don't be daft. Jump in!

187
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:53,807
I promise, Charlie. I'm gonna catch you.

188
00:10:54,097 --> 00:10:55,136
No, he won't!

189
00:10:55,848 --> 00:10:56,848
Zip it, you.

190
00:10:58,334 --> 00:11:00,059
Look, don't listen to your brother.

191
00:11:00,472 --> 00:11:01,534
Just jump on in.

192
00:11:04,534 --> 00:11:06,680
There's nothing to be afraid of,
Charlie.

193
00:11:08,223 --> 00:11:10,399
I'll catch you. I promise.

194
00:11:33,687 --> 00:11:34,783
I did it!

195
00:11:36,249 --> 00:11:37,308
You got it!

196
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:40,001
- I did it.
- You're swimming, Charlie.

197
00:11:48,624 --> 00:11:49,703
What you writing?

198
00:11:57,657 --> 00:11:58,657
Nothing.

199
00:12:06,407 --> 00:12:07,462
All right, tell me.

200
00:12:10,594 --> 00:12:12,260
Are you sure you want to know?

201
00:12:14,373 --> 00:12:16,231
I mean, it might be easier
if you just...

202
00:12:17,882 --> 00:12:19,074
I want to know.

203
00:12:22,965 --> 00:12:24,191
You're inside a hatch.

204
00:12:24,523 --> 00:12:25,625
It's...

205
00:12:27,113 --> 00:12:28,501
a room full of equipment.

206
00:12:29,552 --> 00:12:31,116
There's a blinking yellow light

207
00:12:31,445 --> 00:12:32,821
above a switch.

208
00:12:33,515 --> 00:12:34,724
You flip the switch.

209
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:37,991
Light goes off.

210
00:12:44,106 --> 00:12:45,230
And then you drown.

211
00:12:56,990 --> 00:12:57,990
When?

212
00:13:01,432 --> 00:13:02,551
I don't know.

213
00:13:02,925 --> 00:13:05,386
You're sure you saw Claire and Aaron
get on that helicopter?

214
00:13:05,676 --> 00:13:06,676
Aye.

215
00:13:09,428 --> 00:13:10,428
So...

216
00:13:12,675 --> 00:13:14,632
before I... drown...

217
00:13:16,726 --> 00:13:18,247
I just have to flip a switch?

218
00:13:20,392 --> 00:13:21,436
That's right.

219
00:13:26,115 --> 00:13:27,115
Where is it, then?

220
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:33,156
Now this is the Looking Glass.

221
00:13:33,801 --> 00:13:35,375
It's an underwater Dharma station.

222
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:38,801
Please, can you tell me anything
you might know about this place?

223
00:13:38,996 --> 00:13:40,346
I've never been down there.

224
00:13:40,659 --> 00:13:42,112
I don't know anyone who has.

225
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:43,800
Why not?

226
00:13:44,383 --> 00:13:45,836
There was some accident.

227
00:13:46,349 --> 00:13:48,673
Ben told us that the station
was completely flooded.

228
00:13:48,806 --> 00:13:50,856
Well, if it's flooded,
then how does it still work?

229
00:13:50,998 --> 00:13:52,508
How it still works is irrelevant.

230
00:13:52,675 --> 00:13:54,955
The question is, how do
we get it to stop working,

231
00:13:55,115 --> 00:13:56,813
so we could use the satellite phone?

232
00:13:59,475 --> 00:14:01,323
The diagram shows
that the looking glass

233
00:14:01,473 --> 00:14:03,336
is connected to the island by a cable.

234
00:14:04,114 --> 00:14:05,969
I feel sure that this is
the very same cable

235
00:14:06,114 --> 00:14:08,155
down the beach
which runs into the ocean.

236
00:14:08,604 --> 00:14:11,266
So if we follow the cable,
it should lead us to the station.

237
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:13,073
So how are we gonna get in?

238
00:14:13,285 --> 00:14:14,374
We swim in.

239
00:14:14,663 --> 00:14:15,855
There's a moon pool...

240
00:14:17,072 --> 00:14:19,400
A room with an open floor
at the base of the station...

241
00:14:19,609 --> 00:14:21,539
Big enough
for a submarine to dock.

242
00:14:21,821 --> 00:14:23,388
Even if the station's flooded,

243
00:14:24,028 --> 00:14:26,514
I think I'll be able to find
the relay switch and disable it.

244
00:14:26,663 --> 00:14:28,249
What about swimming back out?

245
00:14:31,533 --> 00:14:33,624
No. I'm not letting you
go on some suicide mission

246
00:14:33,803 --> 00:14:35,000
just to flip the switch.

247
00:14:35,123 --> 00:14:37,451
Someone has to do it,
or we'll never leave this island.

248
00:14:37,629 --> 00:14:38,629
I'll do it.

249
00:14:39,134 --> 00:14:41,575
I can swim down, turn off that
bloody switch, swim back up.

250
00:14:41,643 --> 00:14:42,654
Piece of cake.

251
00:14:42,691 --> 00:14:44,893
Charlie, you don't even know
what we're talking about.

252
00:14:44,984 --> 00:14:47,164
I was junior swim champion
in northern England.

253
00:14:47,289 --> 00:14:48,690
I can hold my breath for 4 minutes.

254
00:14:48,758 --> 00:14:50,540
I know exactly what
you're talking about.

255
00:14:55,288 --> 00:14:57,411
No, and there's no reason
to do this now.

256
00:14:57,468 --> 00:15:00,011
We're gonna focus on the others,
and then we'll deal with this.

257
00:15:00,056 --> 00:15:02,413
Wait a minute.
We have a chance to signal for a rescue.

258
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:06,109
Look, for 90 days, I've been asked
to make decisions for this entire camp.

259
00:15:06,797 --> 00:15:08,454
There you go.
I just made one.

260
00:15:18,059 --> 00:15:19,626
Rose, that's a sailor's hitch.

261
00:15:20,193 --> 00:15:22,897
It's not gonna hold.
You wanna do a sheet bend like mine.

262
00:15:22,999 --> 00:15:24,634
Oh, so now you're a knot expert.

263
00:15:25,314 --> 00:15:26,649
Well, trust me, it's...

264
00:15:31,763 --> 00:15:32,864
How did you do that?

265
00:15:33,795 --> 00:15:35,203
Watch and learn, dear.

266
00:16:41,219 --> 00:16:42,668
Look there!
Look!

267
00:16:59,494 --> 00:17:00,863
Get off him, damn it!
It's okay.

268
00:17:00,908 --> 00:17:03,856
- What? He's one of them!
- I know! It's okay.

269
00:17:05,665 --> 00:17:07,061
He was in the cage next to me.

270
00:17:07,936 --> 00:17:09,128
I know this guy.

271
00:17:09,810 --> 00:17:11,397
What the hell are you doing here, Karl?

272
00:17:12,390 --> 00:17:13,696
They're... coming...

273
00:17:14,650 --> 00:17:15,672
My people.

274
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:18,297
Sorry you came all this way for nothing,
but we already know.

275
00:17:18,433 --> 00:17:19,662
Then why are you still here?

276
00:17:19,708 --> 00:17:22,618
'cause when they'll show up tomorrow
night, we're gonna be ready for 'em.

277
00:17:22,619 --> 00:17:25,670
Tomorrow? No, no,
they're coming tonight.

278
00:17:32,608 --> 00:17:34,068
They're coming right now!

279
00:17:38,535 --> 00:17:42,301
SIX HOURS AGO (del vo)

280
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:47,922
When did you get back?

281
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,205
Just now.

282
00:17:51,452 --> 00:17:52,452
Where's Locke?

283
00:17:55,473 --> 00:17:56,665
Here's your gun back.

284
00:18:02,067 --> 00:18:03,088
Ben, what's going on?

285
00:18:03,141 --> 00:18:04,141
Where's Ryan?

286
00:18:04,790 --> 00:18:05,994
He's in his tent. Are you...

287
00:18:06,062 --> 00:18:07,390
It's time to get them.

288
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:10,054
But you said tomorrow.

289
00:18:10,265 --> 00:18:11,876
Jacob wants it to happen now.

290
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:14,048
Look, what happened out there?

291
00:18:14,078 --> 00:18:15,852
- Did john see...
- John had an accident.

292
00:18:18,703 --> 00:18:19,703
Ryan?

293
00:18:19,827 --> 00:18:20,827
Yes, sir?

294
00:18:21,234 --> 00:18:22,329
If you leave right now,

295
00:18:22,386 --> 00:18:24,305
how long will it take you
to reach their camp?

296
00:18:24,802 --> 00:18:27,628
Well, if I take my ten best,
we could set up to hit 'em by nightfall.

297
00:18:27,719 --> 00:18:29,795
- Then you better get going.
- No, Ben, wait.

298
00:18:29,965 --> 00:18:31,049
Moving up the schedule...

299
00:18:31,118 --> 00:18:33,331
Juliet may not be ready.
What if she hasn't had time...

300
00:18:33,388 --> 00:18:35,091
Then we'll take all their women...

301
00:18:36,818 --> 00:18:38,714
And we'll sort out
the ones we need later.

302
00:18:39,317 --> 00:18:40,373
And the men?

303
00:18:40,650 --> 00:18:42,988
If any of 'em are stupid enough
to get in your way,

304
00:18:43,639 --> 00:18:44,639
kill 'em.

305
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:46,635
All right.

306
00:18:59,036 --> 00:19:00,092
Karl!

307
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:03,640
It's me!

308
00:19:06,943 --> 00:19:08,328
I thought you were bringing rabbit.

309
00:19:08,374 --> 00:19:10,417
You have to go... now.

310
00:19:10,826 --> 00:19:12,813
What? Did he find out I was out here?

311
00:19:13,017 --> 00:19:15,392
No, but he's sending Pryce
to their beach camp right now,

312
00:19:15,515 --> 00:19:16,611
and you have to warn them.

313
00:19:16,661 --> 00:19:18,042
- Warn them?
- You have to go now!

314
00:19:18,092 --> 00:19:20,305
I thought they were just gonna
take the pregnant women.

315
00:19:20,335 --> 00:19:21,361
If you take the outrigger,

316
00:19:21,383 --> 00:19:23,059
you'll get there
a few hours before them.

317
00:19:23,414 --> 00:19:25,766
- Wait, Alex...
- He's gonna kill them Karl!

318
00:19:29,702 --> 00:19:31,479
Austen and Ford saved your life.

319
00:19:35,391 --> 00:19:36,391
You owe them.

320
00:19:40,395 --> 00:19:41,553
You better take this.

321
00:19:44,715 --> 00:19:46,963
If I get caught, your father's
gonna kill me this time.

322
00:19:47,203 --> 00:19:48,242
Is he my father?

323
00:19:57,876 --> 00:19:59,018
Now go.

324
00:20:25,125 --> 00:20:26,328
Is that everything?

325
00:20:29,555 --> 00:20:30,651
Can we trust him?

326
00:20:30,971 --> 00:20:32,038
You don't trust me?

327
00:20:32,243 --> 00:20:33,243
What about her?

328
00:20:33,741 --> 00:20:34,826
She's a spy.

329
00:20:36,023 --> 00:20:39,191
She's supposed to mark the tents
of the pregnant women with white rocks

330
00:20:39,313 --> 00:20:41,818
- so they can take them.
- They know, Karl, but thanks.

331
00:20:43,757 --> 00:20:46,198
- So what are we gonna do?
- We have to leave now... Hide.

332
00:20:46,553 --> 00:20:49,373
Where? It's their island.
f they wanna kill us, they'll find us.

333
00:20:51,490 --> 00:20:53,464
The sun's gonna go down in a few hours.

334
00:20:54,083 --> 00:20:56,240
- Do we have enough wire yet?
- Not even close.

335
00:20:56,705 --> 00:20:59,018
We have to find out another way
to set the dynamite off.

336
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:00,931
- We can shoot.
- We don't have enough guns.

337
00:21:01,053 --> 00:21:02,308
Ten of them are coming, armed.

338
00:21:02,430 --> 00:21:03,861
Not the others... the tents.

339
00:21:03,983 --> 00:21:06,118
We can camouflage the dynamite
next to the tents,

340
00:21:06,248 --> 00:21:08,530
target it from our positions
at the tree line.

341
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:13,216
Juliet marked three tents.
That means we need three guns.

342
00:21:14,736 --> 00:21:16,563
Here. You can have mine, too.

343
00:21:18,698 --> 00:21:19,776
I'll be your third.

344
00:21:21,601 --> 00:21:23,621
I'll take your gun,
but you're not staying here.

345
00:21:26,150 --> 00:21:28,618
You're gonna lead everyone
to the radio tower... Everyone.

346
00:21:28,777 --> 00:21:29,801
The radio tower?

347
00:21:29,932 --> 00:21:32,082
If this doesn't work,
we can't risk losing the chance

348
00:21:32,204 --> 00:21:33,816
of getting in contact with Naomi's boat,

349
00:21:33,938 --> 00:21:36,077
so everything has to happen
at the same time.

350
00:21:41,342 --> 00:21:42,547
You still up for a swim?

351
00:21:45,903 --> 00:21:47,069
Yeah, I believe I am.

352
00:21:49,215 --> 00:21:50,215
I'll go with him.

353
00:21:51,402 --> 00:21:53,635
Okay, better get to it.

354
00:22:10,156 --> 00:22:11,496
It's here, baby brother.

355
00:22:11,801 --> 00:22:12,840
Christmas is here.

356
00:22:15,965 --> 00:22:17,827
Are these the birds from row two?

357
00:22:19,827 --> 00:22:21,008
Well done, mate.

358
00:22:26,888 --> 00:22:28,682
Well, as you have spent another year

359
00:22:29,099 --> 00:22:31,880
as the only drug-free
rock star in the world,

360
00:22:32,192 --> 00:22:34,326
I'm gonna share
a little-known fact with you.

361
00:22:37,086 --> 00:22:40,367
Father christmas lives
just down the street from here.

362
00:22:40,548 --> 00:22:42,160
Father christmas lives in Helsinki?

363
00:22:42,304 --> 00:22:43,462
Indeed he does,

364
00:22:43,610 --> 00:22:45,491
and in case you haven't noticed,
baby brother,

365
00:22:45,866 --> 00:22:47,898
Finland is the bloody north pole.

366
00:22:50,572 --> 00:22:54,409
Therefore, I have a very special
gift for you this year.

367
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:02,467
Liam, no. Mum gave you that.

368
00:23:02,786 --> 00:23:03,910
You're the firstborn.

369
00:23:04,498 --> 00:23:07,193
It was her father's
and his father before that.

370
00:23:07,315 --> 00:23:09,634
And it's a family heirloom,
and at's why we named the band

371
00:23:09,775 --> 00:23:10,961
after Dexter bloody Stratton.

372
00:23:11,102 --> 00:23:12,153
I know.

373
00:23:12,321 --> 00:23:14,455
But, Charlie, let's be honest.

374
00:23:16,278 --> 00:23:18,055
We both know I'm a sodding mess.

375
00:23:18,589 --> 00:23:20,575
But you... You're different.

376
00:23:20,985 --> 00:23:23,184
You're gonna get married,
have a family...

377
00:23:24,152 --> 00:23:25,254
A baby.

378
00:23:26,652 --> 00:23:27,988
I'll be lucky if I hit 30.

379
00:23:28,110 --> 00:23:29,234
Don't say that, Lee.

380
00:23:29,871 --> 00:23:32,380
The ring has to stay
in the family, Charlie.

381
00:23:33,904 --> 00:23:34,904
So, please...

382
00:23:36,465 --> 00:23:37,465
Take it.

383
00:23:38,841 --> 00:23:40,556
Mum would have wanted it this way.

384
00:23:41,153 --> 00:23:43,190
Pass it on to your little one someday.

385
00:23:43,892 --> 00:23:45,583
I need to know it's safe.

386
00:23:52,827 --> 00:23:54,065
I'll hold on to it...

387
00:23:57,352 --> 00:23:58,515
but I won't take it.

388
00:24:02,437 --> 00:24:04,277
Hey, it fits. Look at that.

389
00:24:06,702 --> 00:24:08,110
Happy christmas, baby brother.

390
00:24:39,904 --> 00:24:40,949
You need some help?

391
00:24:42,844 --> 00:24:44,978
Why didn't you tell me
you were gonna do this?

392
00:24:50,708 --> 00:24:52,082
I didn't want you to worry.

393
00:24:53,699 --> 00:24:55,220
Well, it's dangerous, isn't it,

394
00:24:55,364 --> 00:24:57,363
swimming into some underwater station?

395
00:24:58,062 --> 00:25:00,935
It's what needs to be done
to get us all rescued.

396
00:25:03,530 --> 00:25:04,696
I'll be fine, Claire.

397
00:25:06,010 --> 00:25:07,679
But you gotta promise me something.

398
00:25:09,449 --> 00:25:10,466
While I'm gone...

399
00:25:13,969 --> 00:25:15,229
Don't worry about me.

400
00:25:28,502 --> 00:25:29,547
I'll take him.

401
00:25:32,482 --> 00:25:33,482
Thanks.

402
00:25:40,195 --> 00:25:41,477
Alright, turnip head.

403
00:25:43,423 --> 00:25:45,154
Now you take care of your mum

404
00:25:46,163 --> 00:25:47,389
while I'm away, okay?

405
00:25:57,293 --> 00:25:58,293
I love you.

406
00:26:18,104 --> 00:26:19,137
See you soon.

407
00:26:23,117 --> 00:26:24,280
Be careful, Charlie.

408
00:26:25,582 --> 00:26:26,608
Okay?

409
00:27:21,441 --> 00:27:22,576
Sorry, guys.

410
00:27:22,933 --> 00:27:24,006
Thanks, man.

411
00:27:34,261 --> 00:27:36,532
Help! Help me!

412
00:27:40,163 --> 00:27:41,253
Please!

413
00:27:43,464 --> 00:27:44,474
You, stop!

414
00:27:45,223 --> 00:27:46,836
Get the hell away from her!

415
00:27:47,864 --> 00:27:48,867
What are you doing?

416
00:27:48,989 --> 00:27:49,989
Leave her alone!

417
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:54,240
You okay, miss?

418
00:27:54,801 --> 00:27:56,786
Yes. I think so, yes.

419
00:27:59,177 --> 00:28:00,177
Here you go.

420
00:28:01,818 --> 00:28:03,366
Pardon me while I have a heart attack.

421
00:28:03,488 --> 00:28:05,722
The last time I was in a fight,
I was 8 years old.

422
00:28:08,870 --> 00:28:09,989
And I lost.

423
00:28:11,206 --> 00:28:14,612
Well, that makes you even more
of a hero, doesn't it?

424
00:28:15,488 --> 00:28:16,972
I just did what anyone would do.

425
00:28:17,683 --> 00:28:20,022
Three people walked by the alley.

426
00:28:21,051 --> 00:28:22,153
- What?
- They saw me,

427
00:28:22,903 --> 00:28:24,310
but they just kept on going.

428
00:28:26,989 --> 00:28:28,582
You are a hero, sir...

429
00:28:30,176 --> 00:28:33,235
And don't let anyone ever
tell you differently.

430
00:28:49,492 --> 00:28:51,324
- What's that?
- It's a weight belt.

431
00:28:51,866 --> 00:28:54,210
It should bring you down
quicker than swimming.

432
00:28:55,604 --> 00:28:57,126
Well, every second counts.

433
00:28:58,928 --> 00:29:00,930
So I just take it off when I hit bottom,

434
00:29:01,493 --> 00:29:03,206
swim up through the moon pool,

435
00:29:03,551 --> 00:29:04,744
into the station,

436
00:29:05,750 --> 00:29:09,508
swim into whichever room
has the yellow blinking switch,

437
00:29:11,007 --> 00:29:12,085
flip it.

438
00:29:14,461 --> 00:29:15,485
Nothing to it.

439
00:29:20,184 --> 00:29:23,279
So how long
can you really hold your breath for?

440
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:26,490
Does it matter?

441
00:29:34,355 --> 00:29:37,126
- Do you want me to hit another one?
- No, you've made your point.

442
00:29:37,355 --> 00:29:40,418
Bernard, this is not pheasant hunting
in Montgomery county.

443
00:29:40,540 --> 00:29:42,173
- I know what I'm doing.
- No.

444
00:29:42,295 --> 00:29:45,248
- Pheasants don't shoot back.
- Nothing's gonna happen to me, Rose.

445
00:29:45,542 --> 00:29:48,800
I just have to shoot a tent,
and I'll be right behind you.

446
00:29:49,270 --> 00:29:50,450
Then I'm staying, too.

447
00:29:51,305 --> 00:29:52,417
No, you're not, Rose.

448
00:29:54,563 --> 00:29:56,924
Everyone's gathering down
at the south end of the beach.

449
00:29:57,501 --> 00:29:59,186
No one's staying behind
but the shooters.

450
00:29:59,317 --> 00:30:01,439
Says who? You wanna give me your word

451
00:30:01,561 --> 00:30:04,469
that nothing's gonna happen
to my husband, then I'll go.

452
00:30:06,682 --> 00:30:08,793
I'll give you my word
that if we don't kill everyone

453
00:30:08,915 --> 00:30:10,676
who shows up here in about an hour,

454
00:30:10,987 --> 00:30:12,872
it's not gonna matter where Bernard is.

455
00:30:14,277 --> 00:30:16,491
I like you better
since you got back, Jack.

456
00:30:16,857 --> 00:30:18,390
You're almost an optimist.

457
00:30:19,276 --> 00:30:21,608
Come on.
If you're gonna be hiding in the bushes,

458
00:30:21,730 --> 00:30:23,372
let's get you into somethin' dark.

459
00:30:27,416 --> 00:30:28,646
You better get going.

460
00:30:29,356 --> 00:30:31,815
Rousseau says it's about
a day's walk up to the radio tower.

461
00:30:31,937 --> 00:30:34,208
I'm not taking them to the tower.
You are.

462
00:30:36,392 --> 00:30:38,668
- Excuse me?
- You're not staying behind.

463
00:30:40,044 --> 00:30:41,192
This was my idea.

464
00:30:41,314 --> 00:30:43,054
And I'm perfectly capable
of executing it.

465
00:30:43,176 --> 00:30:45,497
- I owe them!
- What are you more concerned with,

466
00:30:46,162 --> 00:30:49,125
killing the others
or getting our people off this island?

467
00:30:51,795 --> 00:30:53,948
This afternoon,
you said you were our leader.

468
00:30:58,917 --> 00:31:00,548
It's time for you to act like one.

469
00:31:05,355 --> 00:31:07,410
Lead them to the radio tower, Jack...

470
00:31:09,591 --> 00:31:11,113
and then take us all home.

471
00:31:22,497 --> 00:31:24,041
Dudes, wait!

472
00:31:29,035 --> 00:31:31,280
I heard what you're doing.
I wanna come with.

473
00:31:34,553 --> 00:31:37,493
Everyone...
They're all going to the radio tower,

474
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:42,070
and I'm sick of trekking and,
you know, explosions.

475
00:31:43,602 --> 00:31:45,282
I think I can help you guys out.

476
00:31:46,288 --> 00:31:47,730
I'm a really good paddler.

477
00:31:54,229 --> 00:31:55,395
You can't go, Hurley.

478
00:31:57,274 --> 00:31:58,356
Why not?

479
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:01,919
Because...

480
00:32:04,513 --> 00:32:05,614
you're too big.

481
00:32:06,903 --> 00:32:08,344
You won't fit in the boat.

482
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:17,409
That's uncool, man.

483
00:32:20,434 --> 00:32:21,569
Wait.

484
00:32:26,137 --> 00:32:28,805
Dude, it's fine. I don't even
wanna go on your stupid boat.

485
00:32:35,087 --> 00:32:36,461
I'll catch up with you later.

486
00:32:37,468 --> 00:32:38,671
Just remember I love you, man.

487
00:32:39,731 --> 00:32:41,196
Yeah, whatever. I love you, too.

488
00:32:57,219 --> 00:32:58,909
You got water in there? Good, good.

489
00:32:59,498 --> 00:33:00,861
How about you? Bottled water?

490
00:33:01,308 --> 00:33:02,330
Good.

491
00:33:06,887 --> 00:33:08,173
So here we go again, huh?

492
00:33:10,013 --> 00:33:11,064
Here we go again.

493
00:33:14,698 --> 00:33:16,447
The tents are all marked. We're set.

494
00:33:17,374 --> 00:33:18,866
Sayid find the third shooter?

495
00:33:30,405 --> 00:33:32,378
Ready, Claire?
Need a hand with the little guy?

496
00:33:32,902 --> 00:33:34,231
No, thanks. I'm okay.

497
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:43,507
How's my little sweetheart?

498
00:33:46,877 --> 00:33:49,768
We're just gonna go for a little walk,
so hold onto mum, okay?

499
00:34:14,039 --> 00:34:15,112
This is it!

500
00:34:23,185 --> 00:34:24,236
Ready?

501
00:35:39,651 --> 00:35:40,854
Do you want a blanket?

502
00:35:41,464 --> 00:35:42,782
Oh, thanks. I've got one.

503
00:35:44,094 --> 00:35:45,479
Well, you're warming for two.

504
00:35:45,874 --> 00:35:46,925
Take mine.

505
00:35:49,294 --> 00:35:50,338
Thank you.

506
00:35:59,074 --> 00:36:01,922
So... first plane crash?

507
00:36:03,349 --> 00:36:04,363
What gave it away?

508
00:36:04,963 --> 00:36:06,916
Ah, you can always spot the newbies.

509
00:36:12,144 --> 00:36:13,756
We're gonna be okay, you know.

510
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:16,862
Are we?

511
00:36:17,799 --> 00:36:18,799
We're alive.

512
00:36:19,588 --> 00:36:21,177
We're on a beautiful island.

513
00:36:22,312 --> 00:36:23,737
We'll sleep under the stars,

514
00:36:24,257 --> 00:36:27,132
and before you know it, the helicopters
will come and take us all home.

515
00:36:29,159 --> 00:36:30,646
You really think they'll find us?

516
00:36:32,032 --> 00:36:33,485
Well, yeah. Why wouldn't they?

517
00:36:36,503 --> 00:36:37,599
Thanks.

518
00:36:40,090 --> 00:36:41,135
I'm Charlie.

519
00:36:41,471 --> 00:36:42,560
I'm Claire.

520
00:36:43,197 --> 00:36:44,514
Nice to meet you, Charlie.

521
00:36:44,995 --> 00:36:46,187
It's nice to meet you.

522
00:37:07,891 --> 00:37:09,106
We're here.

523
00:37:20,045 --> 00:37:21,779
I want you to give this
to Claire for me.

524
00:37:28,484 --> 00:37:29,484
What is it?

525
00:37:34,731 --> 00:37:36,675
It's the five best moments of my...

526
00:37:38,496 --> 00:37:39,893
sorry excuse for a life.

527
00:37:43,403 --> 00:37:44,608
My greatest hits.

528
00:37:50,605 --> 00:37:51,605
You know...

529
00:37:55,233 --> 00:37:56,233
memories...

530
00:37:58,072 --> 00:37:59,168
are all I've got.

531
00:38:01,586 --> 00:38:02,768
You don't have to do this.

532
00:38:04,586 --> 00:38:05,596
What?

533
00:38:07,605 --> 00:38:08,605
I'll go.

534
00:38:09,802 --> 00:38:11,363
No, your... Your flashes...

535
00:38:11,575 --> 00:38:12,580
Maybe...

536
00:38:13,442 --> 00:38:15,461
I keep seeing you die because...

537
00:38:18,048 --> 00:38:19,706
I'm supposed to take your place.

538
00:38:25,586 --> 00:38:26,835
What about your girl...

539
00:38:27,687 --> 00:38:28,794
Penny?

540
00:38:31,021 --> 00:38:32,224
What about your girl?

541
00:38:36,937 --> 00:38:38,044
Besides...

542
00:38:42,428 --> 00:38:43,799
I might be luckier than you.

543
00:38:54,303 --> 00:38:55,790
Keep your memories to yourself.

544
00:38:59,846 --> 00:39:01,118
I'll take it from here.

545
00:39:09,221 --> 00:39:10,481
I don't know what to say.

546
00:39:14,084 --> 00:39:16,785
Well, you can tell me where the,
the weight belt is.

547
00:39:18,148 --> 00:39:19,408
Right there behind you.

548
00:39:45,742 --> 00:39:47,036
You and I both know...

549
00:39:48,318 --> 00:39:50,270
You aren't supposed
to take my place, brother.

550
00:41:55,063 --> 00:41:56,295
I'm alive.
