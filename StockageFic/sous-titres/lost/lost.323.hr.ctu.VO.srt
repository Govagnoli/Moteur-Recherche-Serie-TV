2
00:00:10,819 --> 00:00:11,819
You okay?

3
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:15,070
Yeah, I just...

4
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:16,727
got a rock in my shoe.

5
00:00:27,258 --> 00:00:28,626
He didt mean it, you know.

6
00:00:30,818 --> 00:00:31,818
What?

7
00:00:32,132 --> 00:00:33,132
Sawyer.

8
00:00:34,006 --> 00:00:36,947
When he said that he didn't want you
to go with him... he didn't mean it.

9
00:00:37,381 --> 00:00:39,037
If he didn't mean it, why'd he say it?

10
00:00:40,718 --> 00:00:42,319
He was trying to protect you.

11
00:00:45,883 --> 00:00:48,180
That's why I asked you
not to come back for me.

12
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:58,662
Why are you sticking up for Sawyer?

13
00:00:59,005 --> 00:01:00,320
He'd never do it for you.

14
00:01:06,871 --> 00:01:08,008
Because I love you.

15
00:03:01,071 --> 00:03:02,071
Can I help you?

16
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:03,757
Sorry. I...

17
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,411
Actually, I came...

18
00:03:11,631 --> 00:03:12,683
Is the funeral over?

19
00:03:13,569 --> 00:03:15,507
There was no funeral, sir.
Only a viewing.

20
00:03:16,632 --> 00:03:17,632
Nobody showed up.

21
00:03:19,695 --> 00:03:20,695
Nobody?

22
00:03:21,828 --> 00:03:23,318
- You sure?
- Just you.

23
00:03:23,508 --> 00:03:24,865
My deepest condolences.

24
00:03:26,132 --> 00:03:27,132
Friend or family?

25
00:03:31,009 --> 00:03:32,009
Neither.

26
00:03:33,591 --> 00:03:35,076
Would you like me to open it up?

27
00:03:39,306 --> 00:03:40,443
Take your time.

28
00:04:14,570 --> 00:04:15,805
Damn it.

29
00:04:43,613 --> 00:04:44,613
How much further?

30
00:04:45,112 --> 00:04:46,112
About an hour.

31
00:04:48,423 --> 00:04:51,048
The radio tower...
when was the last time you were there?

32
00:04:51,169 --> 00:04:52,680
The day I recorded the message.

33
00:04:54,923 --> 00:04:57,671
I'll take you to the tower,
but I'm not leaving the island.

34
00:04:58,531 --> 00:04:59,546
What?

35
00:04:59,713 --> 00:05:01,317
There's no place for me back there.

36
00:05:02,174 --> 00:05:03,414
This is my home now.

37
00:05:29,298 --> 00:05:30,298
We need to talk.

38
00:05:44,956 --> 00:05:47,018
What did Ben say? Can we kill him?

39
00:05:47,332 --> 00:05:49,542
Is it possible to turn
this equipment off?

40
00:05:50,585 --> 00:05:51,585
What?

41
00:05:51,707 --> 00:05:54,208
The equipment that's jamming
the island, can you turn it off?

42
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:56,352
Sure. Ben gave us the code.

43
00:05:56,541 --> 00:05:57,911
You are the only ones who have it?

44
00:05:58,065 --> 00:05:59,724
Yeah. Why?

45
00:06:00,457 --> 00:06:02,809
What would happen
if the station were to be flooded?

46
00:06:03,486 --> 00:06:05,927
Nothing. The casing for
the equipment is waterproof.

47
00:06:06,091 --> 00:06:07,148
It'll keep going forever.

48
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:08,584
Then why do you need to be here?

49
00:06:08,708 --> 00:06:09,988
Because Ben told us to.

50
00:06:10,456 --> 00:06:11,614
We were following orders.

51
00:06:11,769 --> 00:06:12,895
And you never asked why?

52
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:16,890
No, because I trust him,
and I trust Jacob,

53
00:06:17,695 --> 00:06:20,170
and the minute I start
questioning orders, this whole thing...

54
00:06:20,292 --> 00:06:22,492
everything that we're doing here...
falls apart.

55
00:06:26,022 --> 00:06:27,548
She makes an excellent point.

56
00:06:50,459 --> 00:06:51,459
Please...

57
00:06:52,271 --> 00:06:53,271
I'm sorry, Bonnie.

58
00:06:53,646 --> 00:06:55,119
I, too, am following orders.

59
00:07:10,018 --> 00:07:11,018
We need her.

60
00:07:35,659 --> 00:07:38,022
Hi. I'm Benjamin. I don't
believe we've had the pleasure...

61
00:07:38,144 --> 00:07:39,319
Don't talk to him!

62
00:07:42,519 --> 00:07:43,519
What do you want?

63
00:07:44,019 --> 00:07:45,545
Just a moment of your time...

64
00:07:46,519 --> 00:07:48,657
to talk, you and me, alone.

65
00:07:49,958 --> 00:07:50,958
For what?

66
00:07:51,330 --> 00:07:53,064
You've just killed seven of my people.

67
00:07:53,186 --> 00:07:55,076
The least you can give me
is five minutes.

68
00:08:00,343 --> 00:08:01,462
Is he alone?

69
00:08:01,616 --> 00:08:03,634
There's only two sets
of tracks... his and hers.

70
00:08:12,709 --> 00:08:13,709
Five minutes.

71
00:08:33,769 --> 00:08:36,619
I'm sorry, sir there are no more
refills left on this prescription.

72
00:08:40,813 --> 00:08:43,063
Well, that... That's a mistake.
I...

73
00:08:43,687 --> 00:08:45,846
I only refilled it twice.
Could you check again?

74
00:08:46,565 --> 00:08:48,190
I did check it again, Dr. Shephard,

75
00:08:48,312 --> 00:08:50,931
and that was the third refill,
so there's nothing I can do.

76
00:08:52,939 --> 00:08:55,102
Fine. I've got another prescription
right here.

77
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:56,764
Hey, I know you.

78
00:08:58,175 --> 00:08:59,198
You're the hero.

79
00:08:59,902 --> 00:09:01,169
I'm not a hero.

80
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:03,647
We saw it on tv.
Hey, lady, what's wrong with you?

81
00:09:03,785 --> 00:09:06,067
Give this guy whatever he needs.
You know what he did?

82
00:09:06,189 --> 00:09:07,294
Here, just... Here...

83
00:09:07,938 --> 00:09:08,938
Oxycodone.

84
00:09:09,173 --> 00:09:11,555
Dr. Shephard, you can't write
a prescription for yourself.

85
00:09:11,677 --> 00:09:14,129
That's not me.
That's Dr. Christian Shephard.

86
00:09:14,251 --> 00:09:16,135
I'm Dr. Jack Shephard.
He's my father.

87
00:09:16,396 --> 00:09:17,997
I'm gonna call his office to confirm...

88
00:09:18,152 --> 00:09:20,969
- He's out of town right now.
- I'm sure somebody in the office...

89
00:09:22,568 --> 00:09:23,627
Don't bother.

90
00:09:39,377 --> 00:09:40,377
Have a seat.

91
00:09:48,938 --> 00:09:51,900
Not so long ago, Jack,
I made a decision

92
00:09:52,999 --> 00:09:55,925
that took the lives
of over 40 people in a single day.

93
00:09:59,690 --> 00:10:01,321
I'm telling you this because...

94
00:10:02,562 --> 00:10:04,531
history is about
to repeat itself right here,

95
00:10:04,688 --> 00:10:05,688
right now.

96
00:10:06,063 --> 00:10:07,273
Let me guess. You've...

97
00:10:07,686 --> 00:10:10,018
You've got us surrounded,
and if I don't do what you say,

98
00:10:10,190 --> 00:10:11,190
you're gonna...

99
00:10:11,655 --> 00:10:12,928
You're gonna kill all my people.

100
00:10:13,066 --> 00:10:14,821
No, Jack. You are.

101
00:10:18,942 --> 00:10:20,466
And how am I gonna do that?

102
00:10:20,626 --> 00:10:22,041
The woman you're traveling with...

103
00:10:22,687 --> 00:10:25,281
the one who parachuted onto
the island from a helicopter...

104
00:10:26,690 --> 00:10:28,268
she's not who she says she is.

105
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:32,189
- She's not, huh?
- No, she's not.

106
00:10:34,214 --> 00:10:35,312
Then who is she?

107
00:10:35,499 --> 00:10:37,000
She's a representative of some people

108
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:38,873
who have been trying
to find this island.

109
00:10:41,956 --> 00:10:43,431
She's one of the bad guys.

110
00:10:46,059 --> 00:10:47,602
I almost forgot. You're the...

111
00:10:48,655 --> 00:10:49,677
You're the good guys.

112
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:50,940
Jack, listen to me.

113
00:10:51,365 --> 00:10:52,838
If you phone her boat,

114
00:10:53,166 --> 00:10:55,976
every single living person
on this island

115
00:10:56,493 --> 00:10:57,612
will be killed.

116
00:11:02,419 --> 00:11:03,924
So here's what has to happen.

117
00:11:04,626 --> 00:11:05,626
Get that device...

118
00:11:06,690 --> 00:11:08,420
the phone she carries with her...

119
00:11:09,249 --> 00:11:10,251
and give it to me.

120
00:11:10,855 --> 00:11:11,876
I will turn around.

121
00:11:12,376 --> 00:11:13,607
We'll go back to my people.

122
00:11:14,289 --> 00:11:16,334
You will turn around,
go back to your people.

123
00:11:17,812 --> 00:11:19,022
I'm not going anywhere.

124
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:29,850
May I have my walkie back?

125
00:11:30,385 --> 00:11:32,604
- What?
- There's something you need to hear.

126
00:11:33,751 --> 00:11:34,751
Please?

127
00:11:44,187 --> 00:11:45,187
Thank you.

128
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:49,783
Tom, are you there?

129
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:53,333
<i>Yeah, I'm here.</i>

130
00:11:55,069 --> 00:11:56,826
Your plan killed seven of my people,

131
00:11:57,465 --> 00:12:00,304
but the ones that you failed to kill
are now holding your friends

132
00:12:00,497 --> 00:12:03,090
Jin, Sayid, Bernard... at gunpoint.

133
00:12:03,746 --> 00:12:05,048
<i>Jack, don't give him any...</i>

134
00:12:05,723 --> 00:12:08,019
<i>- Leave him alone!
- I said shut up!</i>

135
00:12:10,651 --> 00:12:13,579
And what's to stop me
from snapping your neck...

136
00:12:13,701 --> 00:12:16,795
Tom, unless you hear my voice
in one minute, shoot all three of them.

137
00:12:25,237 --> 00:12:26,607
Bring me the phone.

138
00:12:32,307 --> 00:12:33,362
40 seconds.

139
00:12:33,484 --> 00:12:36,397
No.
I'm getting them all off the island.

140
00:12:36,522 --> 00:12:38,314
- All of 'em!
- Let me ask you something.

141
00:12:38,539 --> 00:12:39,994
Why do you want to leave the island?

142
00:12:40,116 --> 00:12:42,440
What is it you so desperately
wanna get back to?

143
00:12:43,555 --> 00:12:44,555
You have no one.

144
00:12:45,304 --> 00:12:48,157
Your father's dead. Your wife left you,
moved on with another man.

145
00:12:49,235 --> 00:12:51,357
Can you just not wait
to get back to the hospital,

146
00:12:51,759 --> 00:12:53,129
get back to fixing things?

147
00:12:54,005 --> 00:12:55,298
It's 20 seconds now.

148
00:12:56,429 --> 00:12:57,902
Just get me the phone.

149
00:12:59,225 --> 00:13:00,304
Ten seconds.

150
00:13:00,646 --> 00:13:01,707
Bring me the phone.

151
00:13:01,834 --> 00:13:03,502
- I'm not bluffing.
- I won't do it!

152
00:13:03,725 --> 00:13:05,827
Four... three...

153
00:13:17,305 --> 00:13:18,305
I'm so sorry, Jack.

154
00:13:50,554 --> 00:13:51,729
Tom, are you there?

155
00:13:54,181 --> 00:13:55,558
Yeah, Jack, I hear you.

156
00:13:57,492 --> 00:13:59,965
I'm gonna lead my people
up to the radio tower,

157
00:14:00,928 --> 00:14:02,922
and I'm gonna make a call,

158
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:04,681
and I'm gonna get 'em all rescued.

159
00:14:04,802 --> 00:14:05,802
Every one of 'em.

160
00:14:07,679 --> 00:14:09,521
And then I'm gonna come find you...

161
00:14:11,368 --> 00:14:12,578
and I'm gonna kill you.

162
00:14:22,825 --> 00:14:24,260
- What's the code?
- Go away.

163
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:25,899
Let's just get this over with, okay?

164
00:14:26,021 --> 00:14:27,850
- What's the code?
- She'll not tell you.

165
00:14:27,972 --> 00:14:30,108
- Yeah, she'll tell me.
- What makes you say that?

166
00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:32,564
'cause you said it's my destiny
to turn off that jammer.

167
00:14:32,695 --> 00:14:35,510
We're both gonna die
down here, alright?

168
00:14:35,632 --> 00:14:36,914
Let's be perfectly honest.

169
00:14:37,069 --> 00:14:38,949
That one-eyed maniac
just killed your friend.

170
00:14:39,071 --> 00:14:40,334
He shot you in the back.

171
00:14:40,571 --> 00:14:42,947
It would appear
that your glorious leader, Ben,

172
00:14:43,069 --> 00:14:44,069
put him up to it.

173
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:46,647
Are you a sodding idiot?

174
00:14:48,758 --> 00:14:52,417
You have the opportunity
to make Ben very, very angry.

175
00:14:53,446 --> 00:14:54,761
Why would you not take that?

176
00:15:00,929 --> 00:15:03,102
- 5-4-5...
- What?

177
00:15:03,392 --> 00:15:04,842
- 8-7-5-5...
- Is that a code?

178
00:15:04,964 --> 00:15:06,573
- 4-3-7...
- Wait.

179
00:15:07,278 --> 00:15:08,986
- Start again, start again.
- 6...

180
00:15:09,174 --> 00:15:10,190
Start from the beginning!

181
00:15:10,312 --> 00:15:11,778
- 1-3.
- Start from the beginning.

182
00:15:11,981 --> 00:15:13,071
Start again.

183
00:15:13,974 --> 00:15:15,189
Wake up, wake up.

184
00:15:15,383 --> 00:15:16,698
Start again. Start again.

185
00:15:16,845 --> 00:15:18,136
<i>Good vibrations.</i>

186
00:15:18,823 --> 00:15:19,823
What?

187
00:15:20,446 --> 00:15:21,446
Beach Boys.

188
00:15:22,697 --> 00:15:24,009
<i>Good vibrations.</i>

189
00:15:26,661 --> 00:15:27,809
On the keypad.

190
00:15:28,197 --> 00:15:29,197
The numbers...

191
00:15:30,805 --> 00:15:31,884
they're notes.

192
00:15:36,007 --> 00:15:38,084
It was programmed by a musician.

193
00:16:03,919 --> 00:16:04,919
Tie him up.

194
00:16:05,859 --> 00:16:06,911
He's coming with us.

195
00:16:27,424 --> 00:16:28,424
What?

196
00:16:37,109 --> 00:16:38,161
This is your mother.

197
00:17:08,557 --> 00:17:10,143
Will you help me tie him up?

198
00:17:30,109 --> 00:17:31,465
What happened? What'd he say?

199
00:17:32,371 --> 00:17:33,606
It's not important right now.

200
00:17:34,201 --> 00:17:36,400
- Just get everybody together.
- Jack, your knuckles.

201
00:17:50,172 --> 00:17:51,172
What happened?

202
00:17:54,485 --> 00:17:55,485
He killed them.

203
00:18:01,538 --> 00:18:02,734
All three of 'em. He...

204
00:18:05,274 --> 00:18:06,464
He radioed the beach.

205
00:18:08,313 --> 00:18:09,476
And I let it happen.

206
00:18:14,296 --> 00:18:15,557
I had to let it happen.

207
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,590
We can't tell Rose...

208
00:18:19,859 --> 00:18:20,996
or Sun, not yet.

209
00:18:22,047 --> 00:18:24,025
We gotta keep moving. I promised Sayid

210
00:18:24,808 --> 00:18:26,177
that we would keep moving.

211
00:18:28,359 --> 00:18:29,707
So why did you bring him back?

212
00:18:32,297 --> 00:18:33,823
Why didn't you just kill him?

213
00:18:34,983 --> 00:18:36,509
Because I want him to see it.

214
00:18:38,608 --> 00:18:40,347
I want him to experience the moment

215
00:18:40,469 --> 00:18:42,746
that we get off this island,
and I want him to know...

216
00:18:44,762 --> 00:18:45,860
That he failed.

217
00:18:51,774 --> 00:18:53,105
And then I'll kill him.

218
00:18:57,190 --> 00:18:59,081
It was an order, Tom.
We had to follow it.

219
00:18:59,975 --> 00:19:02,078
Ben didn't know what the hell
he's talking about.

220
00:19:02,238 --> 00:19:05,402
He's lost it.
I mean, look at what they did to us!

221
00:19:05,736 --> 00:19:08,035
Instead of putting three bullets
in the damn sand,

222
00:19:08,305 --> 00:19:09,926
we should've killed them for real.

223
00:19:21,474 --> 00:19:23,885
All they got left is
three guys and four guns.

224
00:19:24,036 --> 00:19:26,679
And all we've got, James,
are two people and no guns.

225
00:19:28,421 --> 00:19:29,575
So we'll wait till night.

226
00:19:29,697 --> 00:19:31,933
That isn't gonna change the fact
that we're unarmed.

227
00:19:32,055 --> 00:19:34,872
If you wanna kill yourself, that's fine,
but before you go and try...

228
00:19:39,045 --> 00:19:40,045
You hear that?

229
00:20:07,877 --> 00:20:09,073
Stay in the bus, hero.

230
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:41,077
Stay right there, Tom.

231
00:20:50,922 --> 00:20:51,922
I give up.

232
00:21:02,047 --> 00:21:03,883
That's for taking the kid off the raft.

233
00:21:10,295 --> 00:21:11,737
Dude, it was over. He surrendered.

234
00:21:14,424 --> 00:21:15,529
I didn't believe him.

235
00:21:58,507 --> 00:22:00,070
What are you doing, Dr. Shephard?

236
00:22:00,694 --> 00:22:01,831
I was just...

237
00:22:02,821 --> 00:22:04,305
I was just checking the...

238
00:22:05,703 --> 00:22:06,820
The Arlen charts.

239
00:22:06,985 --> 00:22:09,570
Just wanted to...
Wanted to see how the operation went.

240
00:22:09,783 --> 00:22:12,580
I left three messages on your
voice mail. You didn't get them?

241
00:22:14,264 --> 00:22:15,401
My phone's broken.

242
00:22:19,201 --> 00:22:20,439
Let's go to my office.

243
00:22:21,763 --> 00:22:22,763
For what?

244
00:22:23,013 --> 00:22:25,437
We need to have a talk. Come on.

245
00:22:27,374 --> 00:22:28,638
You know, I know that you're...

246
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:31,114
You're new around here,
so you don't know much about me...

247
00:22:31,236 --> 00:22:32,335
I know enough.

248
00:22:32,663 --> 00:22:33,792
So let's go to my office...

249
00:22:33,914 --> 00:22:35,940
If you got something to say to me,
say it to me...

250
00:22:36,827 --> 00:22:37,827
Right here.

251
00:22:40,578 --> 00:22:42,118
Will you excuse us, please?

252
00:22:48,351 --> 00:22:51,712
Mrs. Arlen, the woman you saved,
woke up in recovery about two hours ago.

253
00:22:52,389 --> 00:22:54,559
She was in some pain
but highly responsive

254
00:22:54,681 --> 00:22:57,073
to the reflex tests and entirely lucid.

255
00:22:57,958 --> 00:22:59,075
Well, that's...

256
00:23:00,826 --> 00:23:01,826
That's great.

257
00:23:02,075 --> 00:23:04,329
But then she described
the series of events

258
00:23:04,451 --> 00:23:05,766
that caused her accident.

259
00:23:07,743 --> 00:23:09,484
She says she was driving over the bridge

260
00:23:09,606 --> 00:23:11,921
when she saw a man
standing on top of the railing

261
00:23:13,390 --> 00:23:14,488
about to jump off.

262
00:23:16,818 --> 00:23:20,002
She was distracted
and lost control of her car.

263
00:23:20,201 --> 00:23:21,618
She ran into the median,

264
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:24,703
rolled over
and was hit by the van behind her.

265
00:23:28,162 --> 00:23:29,893
So the obvious question here...

266
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:33,404
it's how did you get
to that flaming car so fast?

267
00:23:34,264 --> 00:23:37,269
What were you doing on that bridge?

268
00:23:44,890 --> 00:23:47,521
Do you know how many years
I've worked at this hospital?

269
00:23:49,138 --> 00:23:50,138
Do you know...

270
00:23:51,137 --> 00:23:52,351
Anything about me?

271
00:23:53,825 --> 00:23:55,317
Do you have any idea...

272
00:23:56,515 --> 00:23:57,911
what I've been through?

273
00:23:58,888 --> 00:24:00,714
How much have you had to drink today?

274
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,478
Okay, I'll tell you what. You do this...

275
00:24:04,856 --> 00:24:06,423
You get my father down here.

276
00:24:06,758 --> 00:24:10,115
Get him down here right now,
and if I'm drunker than he is,

277
00:24:10,389 --> 00:24:11,429
you can fire me.

278
00:24:14,351 --> 00:24:15,828
Don't you look at me like that.

279
00:24:15,950 --> 00:24:18,215
Don't you... pity me.

280
00:24:18,451 --> 00:24:20,507
- I'm trying to help you...
- You can't help me!

281
00:24:53,310 --> 00:24:55,558
<i>Attention, Others. Come in, Others.</i>

282
00:24:56,426 --> 00:24:57,767
<i>If you're listening to this,</i>

283
00:24:57,941 --> 00:24:59,795
<i>I want you to know
that we got you bastards,</i>

284
00:25:00,798 --> 00:25:03,065
<i>and unless
the rest of you wanna be blown up,</i>

285
00:25:03,648 --> 00:25:05,539
<i>you best stay away from our beach.</i>

286
00:25:09,658 --> 00:25:11,163
<i>Where are you? What's going on?</i>

287
00:25:11,423 --> 00:25:12,896
Dude, I'm back at the beach.

288
00:25:13,326 --> 00:25:14,332
What?

289
00:25:14,454 --> 00:25:16,750
I went back to help Juliet and Sawyer.

290
00:25:17,424 --> 00:25:18,424
I saved them.

291
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,360
You're...

292
00:25:20,551 --> 00:25:21,696
They're okay? Juliet...

293
00:25:21,974 --> 00:25:27,478
Everyone's fine.
Me, Sawyer, Juliet, Sayid, Jin, Bernard.

294
00:25:28,261 --> 00:25:29,361
Wait.

295
00:25:32,113 --> 00:25:34,504
Bernard and Jin and Sayid...
They're with you?

296
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,954
Yeah, dude, I told you.
I saved them all.

297
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:53,318
<i>Stay where you are.
We're almost up to the tower.</i>

298
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:55,169
<i>- You'll be safer there.</i>
- Yeah, I gotcha.

299
00:25:55,291 --> 00:25:57,818
We'll stay put until you like,
you know, phone home.

300
00:26:01,082 --> 00:26:02,082
What about Charlie?

301
00:26:02,268 --> 00:26:03,595
Did he make it back yet?

302
00:26:03,893 --> 00:26:06,832
Not yet, but they're probably
paddling home as we speak.

303
00:26:07,333 --> 00:26:08,840
Don't worry. I'm sure he's fine.

304
00:26:22,647 --> 00:26:24,325
There's diving gear
on those racks, yeah?

305
00:26:24,953 --> 00:26:27,142
- Aye. It's plenty.
- Why don't you take care of that?

306
00:26:27,264 --> 00:26:29,790
- I'll tap out <i>Good Vibrations</i>.
- Alright, mate.

307
00:26:33,064 --> 00:26:34,318
You get any flashes?

308
00:26:36,265 --> 00:26:37,363
No. Nothin'.

309
00:26:39,953 --> 00:26:41,282
I'll meet you back here, then.

310
00:27:34,238 --> 00:27:35,452
So much for fate.

311
00:27:46,604 --> 00:27:47,916
"Incoming transmission"?

312
00:27:54,095 --> 00:27:55,427
<i>Can you hear me ?</i>

313
00:27:55,967 --> 00:27:58,035
Yes! Yes, I can hear you.

314
00:27:58,157 --> 00:27:59,720
<i>Who is this? Who am I speaking to?</i>

315
00:28:01,349 --> 00:28:03,112
Charlie Pace.
I'm a survivor of flight

316
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:06,481
8-1-5... Oceanic, flight 8-1-5.

317
00:28:07,371 --> 00:28:08,548
<i>Where are you?</i>

318
00:28:08,792 --> 00:28:10,329
We're on an island. We're alive.

319
00:28:10,451 --> 00:28:12,535
<i>An island? Well, where?
What's the location?</i>

320
00:28:12,668 --> 00:28:14,251
I don't know. Who's this?

321
00:28:14,483 --> 00:28:15,756
<i>This is Penelope.</i>

322
00:28:15,891 --> 00:28:17,289
<i>Penelope Widmore.</i>

323
00:28:17,540 --> 00:28:19,382
<i>How did you get this frequency?</i>

324
00:28:25,690 --> 00:28:27,079
<i>Did you just say, "Desmond"?</i>

325
00:28:27,295 --> 00:28:29,448
Yeah, he's here. He's with me.

326
00:28:29,772 --> 00:28:31,859
<i>- Is he okay?</i>
- He's brilliant!

327
00:28:31,981 --> 00:28:33,095
Hey, are you on the boat?

328
00:28:33,217 --> 00:28:35,010
- <i>What boat?</i>
- Your boat...

329
00:28:35,168 --> 00:28:36,343
80 miles offshore.

330
00:28:37,355 --> 00:28:38,931
Naomi, parachutist.

331
00:28:39,053 --> 00:28:40,166
<i>I'm not on a boat.</i>

332
00:28:40,288 --> 00:28:41,773
<i>Who's Naomi?</i>

333
00:29:14,644 --> 00:29:15,879
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

334
00:31:24,676 --> 00:31:26,374
Hey, Aaron, it's okay, sweetie.

335
00:31:26,701 --> 00:31:27,897
What's the matter?

336
00:31:28,505 --> 00:31:30,345
I don't know.
I think he's just a bit scared.

337
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:32,300
Hard to blame him.

338
00:31:36,303 --> 00:31:38,595
- What is it?
- What's your boyfriend's name...

339
00:31:38,717 --> 00:31:40,366
The rock star who goes to the station?

340
00:31:40,488 --> 00:31:41,488
Charlie. Why?

341
00:31:44,942 --> 00:31:46,331
Charlie just got us rescued.

342
00:31:52,075 --> 00:31:53,175
He did it!

343
00:31:53,327 --> 00:31:55,331
- Your friend bloody well did it.
- What?

344
00:31:56,012 --> 00:31:58,014
The green light... it's on.
The jamming stopped.

345
00:31:58,389 --> 00:31:59,389
Use it, then.

346
00:31:59,762 --> 00:32:00,762
Alright.

347
00:32:03,184 --> 00:32:04,263
<i>4-2.</i>

348
00:32:09,325 --> 00:32:10,325
What's this?

349
00:32:11,515 --> 00:32:13,979
It's Rousseau's message.
It's still blocking the signal.

350
00:32:14,356 --> 00:32:16,575
It doesn't matter. We're here.

351
00:32:16,850 --> 00:32:20,592
<i>Iteration 1-7-5-0-4-5.</i>

352
00:33:14,697 --> 00:33:16,626
I recorded this 16 years ago.

353
00:33:17,975 --> 00:33:20,213
Three days before you were born.

354
00:33:26,350 --> 00:33:27,913
I guess we don't need it anymore.

355
00:33:35,288 --> 00:33:36,540
All right. Do it.

356
00:33:44,225 --> 00:33:45,649
I can't get a signal in here.

357
00:34:03,636 --> 00:34:04,909
I'm getting something.

358
00:34:07,216 --> 00:34:08,258
It's gonna work.

359
00:34:08,416 --> 00:34:10,596
It's happening.
We're gonna get off of this island.

360
00:34:11,351 --> 00:34:12,779
We'll celebrate when we're home.

361
00:34:17,598 --> 00:34:19,732
I know you think
you're saving your people,

362
00:34:20,598 --> 00:34:21,966
but you need to stop this.

363
00:34:22,537 --> 00:34:23,537
It's a mistake.

364
00:34:23,906 --> 00:34:25,468
The mistake was listening to you.

365
00:34:25,664 --> 00:34:27,363
This will be your last chance.

366
00:34:27,661 --> 00:34:29,455
I'm telling you, making that call

367
00:34:29,725 --> 00:34:31,198
is the beginning of the end.

368
00:34:31,785 --> 00:34:33,216
I've got it! I've got a signal!

369
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:37,391
Jack, please!
You don't know what you're doing!

370
00:34:37,539 --> 00:34:38,849
I know exactly what I'm doing.

371
00:34:58,072 --> 00:34:59,228
Step back, Jack.

372
00:35:08,164 --> 00:35:09,164
What did you do?

373
00:35:09,324 --> 00:35:11,562
What I had to. Now step back.

374
00:35:18,620 --> 00:35:19,874
Stay away from the phone.

375
00:35:28,501 --> 00:35:29,678
What are you doing?

376
00:35:30,478 --> 00:35:31,572
I don't want to shoot you.

377
00:35:31,853 --> 00:35:33,063
Do it, John! Shoot him!

378
00:35:33,419 --> 00:35:34,488
Do what you need...

379
00:35:41,978 --> 00:35:45,717
Please, put the phone down.

380
00:35:49,884 --> 00:35:51,891
You're done keeping me on this island

381
00:35:57,479 --> 00:35:58,479
I will...

382
00:35:59,041 --> 00:36:00,049
kill you...

383
00:36:00,596 --> 00:36:01,688
if I have to.

384
00:36:02,158 --> 00:36:03,277
Then do it.

385
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,774
You're not supposed to do this.

386
00:36:31,474 --> 00:36:32,564
<i>Minkowski.</i>

387
00:36:41,354 --> 00:36:42,375
Who is this?

388
00:36:42,549 --> 00:36:43,745
<i>Who is this?</i>

389
00:36:45,940 --> 00:36:47,763
My name's Jack Shephard. Are you...

390
00:36:48,691 --> 00:36:50,241
Are you on the boat... the freighter?

391
00:36:50,916 --> 00:36:52,132
<i>How'd you get this channel?</i>

392
00:36:53,467 --> 00:36:55,240
Naomi told us about your search team,

393
00:36:55,362 --> 00:36:56,441
about the boat.

394
00:36:56,805 --> 00:37:00,398
<i>Naomi? You found her?
Where is she? Who are you?</i>

395
00:37:02,194 --> 00:37:04,935
I'm one of the survivors
of oceanic flight 815.

396
00:37:07,192 --> 00:37:08,916
Can you get a fix on our location?

397
00:37:09,379 --> 00:37:10,665
<i>Hell, yeah, we can.</i>

398
00:37:10,787 --> 00:37:13,430
<i>Sit tight. We'll be right there.</i>

399
00:38:16,941 --> 00:38:17,941
It's me.

400
00:38:19,431 --> 00:38:21,689
Wait. Don't... Don't hang up, please.

401
00:38:24,597 --> 00:38:26,213
I know what you said. I just...

402
00:38:28,146 --> 00:38:29,465
I just need to see you.

403
00:38:30,567 --> 00:38:31,567
Please.

404
00:38:35,818 --> 00:38:37,133
Yeah, out at the airport.

405
00:38:39,004 --> 00:38:40,004
You know where.

406
00:38:43,630 --> 00:38:44,630
Thank you.

407
00:40:07,068 --> 00:40:08,120
Saw you on the news.

408
00:40:10,005 --> 00:40:12,207
Still pulling people
out of burning wreckage, huh?

409
00:40:13,254 --> 00:40:14,254
Old habits.

410
00:40:18,303 --> 00:40:19,441
You look terrible.

411
00:40:22,068 --> 00:40:23,068
Thanks.

412
00:40:26,006 --> 00:40:27,374
Why did you call me?

413
00:40:38,937 --> 00:40:40,692
I was hoping that you'd heard,

414
00:40:41,346 --> 00:40:42,908
that maybe you'd go to the funeral.

415
00:40:46,630 --> 00:40:48,103
Why would I go to the funeral?

416
00:41:01,242 --> 00:41:02,515
Been flying a lot.

417
00:41:04,396 --> 00:41:05,445
What?

418
00:41:05,567 --> 00:41:07,178
The golden pass that they gave us.

419
00:41:08,004 --> 00:41:09,267
I've been using it.

420
00:41:09,565 --> 00:41:10,828
Every friday night, I...

421
00:41:13,003 --> 00:41:15,837
I fly from L.A. to Tokyo or...

422
00:41:17,254 --> 00:41:20,406
Singapore or... Sydney.

423
00:41:23,390 --> 00:41:24,411
And then I...

424
00:41:24,566 --> 00:41:25,818
I get off, and I...

425
00:41:26,567 --> 00:41:28,785
have a drink
and then I fly home.

426
00:41:30,816 --> 00:41:31,816
Why?

427
00:41:35,255 --> 00:41:36,991
Because I want it to crash.

428
00:41:41,136 --> 00:41:43,528
I don't care
about anybody else on board.

429
00:41:45,655 --> 00:41:47,700
Every little bump we hit or...

430
00:41:48,375 --> 00:41:49,681
turbulence, I mean, like,

431
00:41:50,819 --> 00:41:52,729
I actually close my eyes,

432
00:41:54,007 --> 00:41:55,531
and I pray

433
00:41:56,438 --> 00:41:57,827
that I can get back...

434
00:42:06,067 --> 00:42:08,344
- This is not gonna change...
- No, I'm sick...

435
00:42:09,019 --> 00:42:10,194
of lying.

436
00:42:14,022 --> 00:42:15,255
We made a mistake.

437
00:42:22,192 --> 00:42:23,192
I have to go.

438
00:42:24,004 --> 00:42:25,705
He's gonna be wondering where I am...

439
00:42:32,816 --> 00:42:33,816
We...

440
00:42:34,567 --> 00:42:35,988
were not supposed to leave.

441
00:42:36,817 --> 00:42:37,817
Yes, we were.

442
00:42:46,637 --> 00:42:47,756
Good-bye, Jack.

443
00:42:56,845 --> 00:42:58,255
We have to go back, Kate.

444
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:17,319
We have to go back!
