00:00:00,544 --> 00:00:01,967
<i>Previously on</i> Lost...

2
00:00:02,485 --> 00:00:03,812
You stole my kidney.

3
00:00:04,049 --> 00:00:06,215
You need a father, and I need a kidney.

4
00:00:06,488 --> 00:00:07,488
Get over it.

5
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:15,485
I know you were raised in foster care.

6
00:00:15,566 --> 00:00:16,926
I know you spent the four years

7
00:00:17,001 --> 00:00:19,210
prior to your arrival
on this island in a wheelchair,

8
00:00:19,287 --> 00:00:21,134
and I know how you ended up in it.

9
00:00:21,173 --> 00:00:23,636
What if I told you
that somewhere on this island,

10
00:00:23,805 --> 00:00:26,000
there's a very large box,

11
00:00:27,173 --> 00:00:30,317
and whatever you imagined,
whatever you wanted to be in it,

12
00:00:31,274 --> 00:00:34,745
when you opened that box,
there it would be?

13
00:00:35,102 --> 00:00:38,756
I'd say I hope that box is big enough
to imagine yourself up new submarine.

14
00:00:46,499 --> 00:00:48,535
Well, John, you've really gone
and done it now.

15
00:00:48,601 --> 00:00:51,489
You're not gonna start talking about
the magic box again, are you?

16
00:00:51,611 --> 00:00:54,722
No, John. I'm gonna show you
what came out of it.

17
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:58,360
Dad?

18
00:01:21,237 --> 00:01:22,237
Save your breath.

19
00:01:25,219 --> 00:01:26,551
Nobody's gonna hear you.

20
00:01:42,112 --> 00:01:43,112
Dad?

21
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:49,254
What is this?

22
00:01:49,301 --> 00:01:52,356
You tell me. You brought him here.

23
00:01:52,672 --> 00:01:53,953
I didn't bring him here.

24
00:01:54,047 --> 00:01:56,772
I'd be careful about getting
too close to him, John.

25
00:01:57,492 --> 00:02:00,173
Well, where did you find him?
Why did you bring him here?

26
00:02:00,241 --> 00:02:02,605
I've already said... We didn't...

27
00:02:02,676 --> 00:02:04,321
You want me to ask him how he got here?

28
00:02:04,389 --> 00:02:05,406
Be my guest.

29
00:02:10,898 --> 00:02:12,400
I warned you, John.

30
00:02:15,172 --> 00:02:16,379
Don't you know, John?

31
00:02:17,236 --> 00:02:19,378
Don't you know where we are?

32
00:02:25,279 --> 00:02:26,295
What did he mean?

33
00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:29,188
I'm afraid we don't have time
to deal with that right now, John.

34
00:02:29,739 --> 00:02:31,881
We're leaving
first thing in the morning, all of us.

35
00:02:31,922 --> 00:02:33,033
Where are you going?

36
00:02:35,049 --> 00:02:36,549
We're going to a new place.

37
00:02:38,047 --> 00:02:39,658
Well, an old place, actually.

38
00:02:41,612 --> 00:02:43,334
Would you like to come with us?

39
00:02:49,675 --> 00:02:50,675
Yes.

40
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:51,860
Good.

41
00:02:53,987 --> 00:02:56,543
We're holding Kate
a few buildings over from here.

42
00:02:56,799 --> 00:02:58,489
Maybe you'd like to say good-bye.

43
00:03:22,516 --> 00:03:23,863
Hey, where you going?

44
00:03:25,361 --> 00:03:27,471
I can't sleep if I'm not in my own tent.

45
00:03:27,857 --> 00:03:30,418
Fine. Let's go to your tent.

46
00:03:36,986 --> 00:03:38,652
It's nothing personal. It's...

47
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:41,466
old habits, you know?

48
00:03:45,235 --> 00:03:46,575
Fine. Scram.

49
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:50,721
You want me to walk you home?

50
00:03:51,923 --> 00:03:53,902
It's five tents. I think I'll make it.

51
00:03:54,624 --> 00:03:57,223
Are you sure? I gotta pee anyway.

52
00:03:58,649 --> 00:04:00,310
That is so romantic.

53
00:04:23,175 --> 00:04:24,619
What the hell y'all doin'?

54
00:04:26,737 --> 00:04:28,070
What the hell you doing?

55
00:04:28,673 --> 00:04:29,839
Going to take a leak.

56
00:04:31,611 --> 00:04:32,833
Yeah, well, so are we.

57
00:04:36,362 --> 00:04:37,584
Well, all righty then.

58
00:05:02,862 --> 00:05:03,862
Hello, James.

59
00:05:12,058 --> 00:05:15,708
Subtitles: swsub.com

60
00:05:25,184 --> 00:05:26,739
You wanna zip your pants up?

61
00:05:29,121 --> 00:05:30,683
What the hell are you doing here?

62
00:05:30,782 --> 00:05:32,128
Looking for you, actually.

63
00:05:33,998 --> 00:05:35,358
Okay, Tarzan.

64
00:05:35,433 --> 00:05:37,460
Now that you're back from your
"blow up everything

65
00:05:37,489 --> 00:05:39,065
that could get us off the island" tour,

66
00:05:39,115 --> 00:05:41,511
how 'bout you tell me why
you joined up with the damn enemy?

67
00:05:41,558 --> 00:05:44,278
I didn't join 'em. I infiltrated 'em.

68
00:05:45,247 --> 00:05:47,656
- You're undercover with the others.
- That's right.

69
00:05:47,748 --> 00:05:50,266
Now how 'bout you give me
one reason to believe that?

70
00:05:51,179 --> 00:05:52,248
Because a few hours ago

71
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:54,559
I snuck into Ben's tent
and kidnapped him.

72
00:05:57,488 --> 00:06:00,169
I tied him up,
dragged him off into the jungle.

73
00:06:01,857 --> 00:06:04,695
And you came all the way back here
to tell me this because...

74
00:06:04,749 --> 00:06:07,015
Because this is the same man
who tortured you,

75
00:06:07,222 --> 00:06:08,860
beat you, humiliated you...

76
00:06:10,308 --> 00:06:12,006
And I want you...

77
00:06:12,547 --> 00:06:13,799
to kill him.

78
00:06:19,238 --> 00:06:20,824
You want him dead, you kill him.

79
00:06:20,936 --> 00:06:22,658
- I'm not a murder.
- Neither am I!

80
00:06:23,248 --> 00:06:25,227
Except for the man you killed in Sydney.

81
00:06:27,309 --> 00:06:28,975
They got files on us, James...

82
00:06:30,186 --> 00:06:31,186
All of us.

83
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:35,091
Yeah, well,
their files got their facts wrong.

84
00:06:42,058 --> 00:06:43,823
Then I made a mistake coming to you.

85
00:06:50,497 --> 00:06:52,522
Please don't tell anyone
that I was here.

86
00:06:53,808 --> 00:06:54,808
Hey, stop!

87
00:06:55,746 --> 00:06:56,746
I said stop!

88
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,628
Damn it! Wait up!

89
00:07:18,416 --> 00:07:21,140
There. That ought to do it.

90
00:07:21,496 --> 00:07:22,496
Thanks.

91
00:07:23,184 --> 00:07:25,321
That would've taken me hours
to do myself.

92
00:07:26,121 --> 00:07:27,121
Glad I could help.

93
00:07:31,057 --> 00:07:32,057
Don't mind them.

94
00:07:32,306 --> 00:07:34,361
They're all just excited you're here.

95
00:07:34,622 --> 00:07:35,622
Excited?

96
00:07:36,243 --> 00:07:37,743
We've been waiting for you.

97
00:07:39,118 --> 00:07:41,018
John, you got a minute?

98
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:43,786
Ben's asking for you.

99
00:07:45,121 --> 00:07:46,121
Okay.

100
00:07:49,525 --> 00:07:51,735
<i>Ben, it's 6:00 a.m. on saturday morning.</i>

101
00:07:51,835 --> 00:07:53,902
<i>Kwon is pregnant.
The fetus is healthy</i>

102
00:07:53,966 --> 00:07:56,655
<i>and was conceived on island
with her husband.</i>

103
00:07:56,833 --> 00:07:58,362
<i>He was sterile when they got here.</i>

104
00:08:00,369 --> 00:08:02,091
Hello, John. Thanks for coming.

105
00:08:03,687 --> 00:08:04,700
What's that?

106
00:08:04,745 --> 00:08:07,617
Juliet is gathering information for us
at your former camp.

107
00:08:08,623 --> 00:08:10,931
She's determing
if any of the women are pregnant.

108
00:08:11,122 --> 00:08:12,733
Then we're gonna go in and...

109
00:08:13,658 --> 00:08:14,662
take them.

110
00:08:16,305 --> 00:08:17,305
Take them?

111
00:08:19,146 --> 00:08:21,119
This is not the first time
we've done this.

112
00:08:21,182 --> 00:08:22,904
Trust me, no one will get hurt.

113
00:08:25,055 --> 00:08:26,777
Could you pass me that, please?

114
00:08:31,046 --> 00:08:32,069
Thank you.

115
00:08:35,859 --> 00:08:38,627
I believe
I have you to thank for this, John.

116
00:08:39,092 --> 00:08:41,850
- Me?
- A week ago, I couldn't move my toes...

117
00:08:44,371 --> 00:08:46,044
But the minute you showed up,

118
00:08:46,995 --> 00:08:49,463
I started to feel pins and needles.

119
00:08:50,557 --> 00:08:52,376
And this is only the beginning, John.

120
00:08:52,555 --> 00:08:54,870
I can't wait to show you
what this island can do,

121
00:08:56,043 --> 00:08:57,154
but unfortunately,

122
00:08:57,872 --> 00:08:59,303
you're not ready, John.

123
00:09:02,248 --> 00:09:04,369
- No, I'm ready.
- No, John, you're not.

124
00:09:05,612 --> 00:09:07,679
You're still crippled by the memories

125
00:09:07,776 --> 00:09:10,562
of the man you used to be
before you came to this island,

126
00:09:11,122 --> 00:09:12,455
and you'll never be free

127
00:09:12,745 --> 00:09:15,459
until you release
the hold that your father has over you.

128
00:09:17,928 --> 00:09:19,661
Why do you think you brought him here?

129
00:09:21,888 --> 00:09:23,540
The magic box.

130
00:09:23,933 --> 00:09:25,768
Okay, Ben, how about you show me...

131
00:09:25,881 --> 00:09:27,525
"Magic box" is a metaphor, John.

132
00:09:27,743 --> 00:09:30,131
I can't show you anything
until you can show me

133
00:09:30,183 --> 00:09:32,186
that you're ready
and willing to be one of us.

134
00:09:32,493 --> 00:09:36,127
When people join us here on this island,
they need to make a gesture

135
00:09:36,244 --> 00:09:38,987
of free will, of commitment.

136
00:09:41,682 --> 00:09:43,826
That's why
you're gonna have to kill your father.

137
00:10:09,927 --> 00:10:10,959
When did you get back?

138
00:10:12,464 --> 00:10:13,473
Last night.

139
00:10:13,555 --> 00:10:15,032
Well, early this morning.

140
00:10:16,119 --> 00:10:18,274
So... camping, huh?

141
00:10:19,782 --> 00:10:21,227
What were you guys doing out there?

142
00:10:22,305 --> 00:10:24,693
We...
figured we'd explore a bit, you know.

143
00:10:24,808 --> 00:10:26,808
See what was further down the beach.

144
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:28,680
Male bonding.

145
00:10:29,309 --> 00:10:32,808
Well, next time you go out, sign me up.

146
00:10:33,058 --> 00:10:34,481
Yeah, next time. Sure.

147
00:10:46,877 --> 00:10:48,057
Thanks, Jin.

148
00:10:50,245 --> 00:10:51,356
We have to tell Jack.

149
00:10:51,530 --> 00:10:53,556
Yeah, I mean,
shouldn't he check out her wound?

150
00:10:53,646 --> 00:10:56,038
Can you give me your word
that Jack can be trusted?

151
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:59,490
That he spent ten days with those people
and that nothing happened to him?

152
00:10:59,555 --> 00:11:01,555
And that woman
he's spending all his time with...

153
00:11:01,604 --> 00:11:03,257
- Juliet.
- Aye. Juliet.

154
00:11:03,539 --> 00:11:05,706
Two weeks ago,
she had your friends in cages.

155
00:11:07,995 --> 00:11:08,999
Naomi...

156
00:11:09,169 --> 00:11:11,318
Well, you heard
everything that she said.

157
00:11:12,306 --> 00:11:13,417
If we keep her safe,

158
00:11:14,871 --> 00:11:16,666
she's our way off this island.

159
00:11:18,622 --> 00:11:19,707
So given that,

160
00:11:19,922 --> 00:11:21,182
do you trust Jack,

161
00:11:22,336 --> 00:11:23,359
or don't you?

162
00:11:27,932 --> 00:11:28,932
Right.

163
00:11:30,122 --> 00:11:32,418
So we better bring in
someone we can trust.

164
00:11:41,971 --> 00:11:43,748
You should've put some shoes on.

165
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:45,220
You think?

166
00:11:47,624 --> 00:11:48,943
So what else is in it?

167
00:11:50,096 --> 00:11:51,096
In what?

168
00:11:52,846 --> 00:11:54,179
The file they got on me.

169
00:11:55,844 --> 00:11:56,844
Not much.

170
00:11:58,220 --> 00:12:00,646
That your parents died
when you were very young.

171
00:12:01,786 --> 00:12:03,008
But it doesn't say why

172
00:12:03,534 --> 00:12:04,758
your father...

173
00:12:05,606 --> 00:12:06,738
shot your mother...

174
00:12:09,781 --> 00:12:11,781
or why he turned the gun on himself.

175
00:12:17,908 --> 00:12:19,630
That must've been hard for you.

176
00:12:30,719 --> 00:12:31,719
What else?

177
00:12:31,906 --> 00:12:33,325
High school transcripts...

178
00:12:34,009 --> 00:12:35,095
criminal record...

179
00:12:35,844 --> 00:12:38,010
all the con jobs you were arrested for.

180
00:12:38,533 --> 00:12:40,794
I guess that's why
you use an alias, huh?

181
00:12:41,041 --> 00:12:42,729
Why did you choose the name Sawyer?

182
00:12:44,406 --> 00:12:45,936
How stupid do you think I am?

183
00:12:46,267 --> 00:12:47,919
I already been conned by Ben once.

184
00:12:48,022 --> 00:12:50,592
Maybe you heard about it...
bunny with a number painted on it?

185
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:52,875
You think I'm just gonna follow you
through the jungle?

186
00:12:52,922 --> 00:12:54,902
Please, you have to...
You have to trust me.

187
00:12:54,930 --> 00:12:56,826
Where are you taking me?
Tell me the truth!

188
00:12:56,861 --> 00:12:57,865
What do you want from me?

189
00:12:57,912 --> 00:13:00,286
I'm bringing you there
to do exactly what I said...

190
00:13:00,409 --> 00:13:02,716
- To kill Ben.
- Why did you come back to get me?

191
00:13:02,783 --> 00:13:04,121
- I had to.
- Why me?!

192
00:13:04,156 --> 00:13:05,476
Why won't you do it yourself?

193
00:13:05,533 --> 00:13:07,466
- James, please...
- Don't call me James!

194
00:13:08,032 --> 00:13:09,893
Why won't you do it yourself?

195
00:13:09,969 --> 00:13:13,017
Because I can't! I can't!
I can't do it!

196
00:13:17,341 --> 00:13:19,049
That's why I came back for you.

197
00:13:28,930 --> 00:13:29,969
Get up.

198
00:13:36,157 --> 00:13:37,622
I'll go to wherever you got him,

199
00:13:37,925 --> 00:13:39,811
but then
we're bringing him back to our camp.

200
00:13:39,908 --> 00:13:42,036
I ain't killing nobody.
You understand me?

201
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:45,749
Yeah. I understand...

202
00:13:47,917 --> 00:13:49,338
But you'll change your mind

203
00:13:53,470 --> 00:13:56,137
When you hear what he has to say,

204
00:13:58,407 --> 00:13:59,833
you'll change your mind.

205
00:14:17,685 --> 00:14:18,745
Hey, dude.

206
00:14:20,530 --> 00:14:21,560
Hello, Hurley.

207
00:14:32,636 --> 00:14:33,858
Can you keep a secret?

208
00:14:42,139 --> 00:14:43,546
You've already spoken to her?

209
00:14:43,697 --> 00:14:46,394
Yeah, but you're gonna want
to hear it for yourself.

210
00:14:46,757 --> 00:14:48,201
And you haven't told Jack?

211
00:14:49,006 --> 00:14:50,006
No.

212
00:14:50,445 --> 00:14:51,445
Good.

213
00:15:03,852 --> 00:15:05,269
My name's Sayid Jarrah.

214
00:15:05,698 --> 00:15:08,044
I understand your helicopter
crashed onto the island.

215
00:15:08,195 --> 00:15:10,083
Actually, it crashed in the water.

216
00:15:11,508 --> 00:15:12,508
What's your name?

217
00:15:12,882 --> 00:15:14,962
Naomi. Naomi Dorrit.

218
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,822
Naomi, from where exactly
did you take off?

219
00:15:18,256 --> 00:15:20,129
A ship... freighter...

220
00:15:20,635 --> 00:15:22,690
About 80 nautical miles west of here.

221
00:15:23,257 --> 00:15:25,108
I'm part of a search and recovery team.

222
00:15:25,569 --> 00:15:29,013
You told my friends the wreckage
of flight 815 was discovered.

223
00:15:29,446 --> 00:15:30,995
Did you mean the partial wreckage?

224
00:15:31,321 --> 00:15:35,171
No. They found the entire plane
off the coast of Bali,

225
00:15:35,461 --> 00:15:37,238
in an ocean trench 4 miles deep.

226
00:15:38,147 --> 00:15:41,523
They sent down cameras in these
little robots to survey the wreck.

227
00:15:42,398 --> 00:15:43,842
The bodies were all there.

228
00:15:47,273 --> 00:15:49,518
Well, obviously we're not dead.

229
00:15:50,867 --> 00:15:51,946
Obviously.

230
00:15:52,119 --> 00:15:53,733
So if you weren't looking for us,

231
00:15:53,897 --> 00:15:55,337
then who were you looking for?

232
00:15:56,211 --> 00:15:57,211
Him.

233
00:15:59,461 --> 00:16:00,461
Desmond?

234
00:16:00,601 --> 00:16:03,529
My company was hired by a woman
named Penelope Widmore.

235
00:16:03,711 --> 00:16:05,614
I don't know why. I never met her.

236
00:16:05,775 --> 00:16:07,409
She gave us a set of coordinates.

237
00:16:08,086 --> 00:16:11,339
We've been conducting a differential
G.P.S. grid search ever since.

238
00:16:12,336 --> 00:16:13,895
You knew about the island?

239
00:16:14,030 --> 00:16:15,205
Island?

240
00:16:15,513 --> 00:16:18,060
We were given coordinates
in the middle of the bloody ocean.

241
00:16:18,398 --> 00:16:20,052
We thought it was a fool's errand...

242
00:16:20,341 --> 00:16:21,612
till three days ago.

243
00:16:22,441 --> 00:16:24,584
I was flying back for the ship,
when all of a sudden

244
00:16:24,585 --> 00:16:26,529
the clouds cleared, and I saw land.

245
00:16:27,321 --> 00:16:28,878
The instruments started spinning.

246
00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:32,461
I realized I was going down,
so I grabbed my chute, and I bailed.

247
00:16:37,188 --> 00:16:39,111
Did you actually see her helicopter?

248
00:16:40,898 --> 00:16:41,898
No.

249
00:16:42,346 --> 00:16:43,687
You think I'm lying, mate?

250
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:45,585
I take it you have no means whatsoever

251
00:16:45,648 --> 00:16:47,759
of communicating
with that freighter of yours?

252
00:16:49,837 --> 00:16:51,990
What was your name? Sayid?

253
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:53,460
Yes.

254
00:17:03,836 --> 00:17:05,780
Remind me not to rescue you, Sayid.

255
00:17:33,604 --> 00:17:34,875
So Ben...

256
00:17:35,203 --> 00:17:37,649
You said I'd kill him
when I heard what he's got to say.

257
00:17:38,272 --> 00:17:40,610
- That's right.
- Well, you wanna give me a heads-up?

258
00:17:41,585 --> 00:17:43,373
It's not really my place to tell you.

259
00:17:47,334 --> 00:17:50,037
Look, what you read in that file...

260
00:17:51,523 --> 00:17:52,967
about the guy in Sydney...

261
00:17:54,458 --> 00:17:56,009
I thought he was someone else.

262
00:17:56,212 --> 00:17:58,368
I made a mistake.
I didn't mean to kill him.

263
00:18:00,399 --> 00:18:02,010
Well, who'd you mean to kill?

264
00:18:10,896 --> 00:18:12,007
Are we almost there?

265
00:18:14,579 --> 00:18:15,639
Almost.

266
00:18:30,147 --> 00:18:31,147
Wake up, John.

267
00:18:33,774 --> 00:18:34,774
It's time.

268
00:19:06,167 --> 00:19:09,286
I know it won't be easy,
but the quicker the better.

269
00:19:13,959 --> 00:19:15,347
You're kidding me, right?

270
00:19:16,898 --> 00:19:19,051
You expect him to kill me?

271
00:19:24,648 --> 00:19:27,034
The hesitation that you're feeling
is just the part of you

272
00:19:27,081 --> 00:19:29,970
that still feels like
he has a perfectly good explanation

273
00:19:30,017 --> 00:19:31,314
for stealing your kidney,

274
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:34,032
throwing you out of an 8-story window.

275
00:19:35,024 --> 00:19:36,857
Don't you wanna be free from him?

276
00:19:37,397 --> 00:19:41,235
The hesitation he's feeling
is because he is a spineless...

277
00:19:41,303 --> 00:19:42,399
Shut up!

278
00:19:50,731 --> 00:19:52,682
- I gotta think...
- Don't think, John.

279
00:19:52,773 --> 00:19:54,510
You're wasting your time, bug-eye.

280
00:19:54,959 --> 00:19:56,509
Me and him have been through all this.

281
00:19:56,644 --> 00:19:59,731
- All he wants is his daddy...
- Shut up! I said shut up!

282
00:20:04,111 --> 00:20:06,982
You really haven't figured it out yet,
have you?

283
00:20:09,383 --> 00:20:11,616
Let go of him, John.

284
00:20:14,583 --> 00:20:15,770
Why are you doing this to me?

285
00:20:15,896 --> 00:20:19,396
You're doing this to yourself.
As long as he's still breathing,

286
00:20:19,522 --> 00:20:22,810
you'll still be
that same sad, pathetic little man

287
00:20:22,895 --> 00:20:25,137
that was kicked off his walkabout tour

288
00:20:25,578 --> 00:20:27,849
because you couldn't walk.

289
00:20:52,086 --> 00:20:55,678
I'll be here the rest of the week, John,
if you change your mind...

290
00:21:11,974 --> 00:21:13,023
I'm sorry.

291
00:21:15,961 --> 00:21:17,683
He's not who we thought he was.

292
00:22:10,273 --> 00:22:11,273
Son of a...

293
00:22:22,181 --> 00:22:23,994
Nice place you got here, Locke.

294
00:22:26,529 --> 00:22:28,035
Ben's inside in the brig.

295
00:22:29,273 --> 00:22:30,273
You ready?

296
00:22:32,772 --> 00:22:33,772
Yeah, I'm ready.

297
00:22:55,177 --> 00:22:56,303
Friends of yours?

298
00:22:57,057 --> 00:23:00,322
It's an old slaving ship,
mid nineteenth century,

299
00:23:07,444 --> 00:23:08,811
My guess is they...

300
00:23:09,064 --> 00:23:12,440
captured the slaves and brought them
here to try and mine the island.

301
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:17,758
What's in the boxes?

302
00:23:18,148 --> 00:23:19,203
That'd be dynamite.

303
00:23:25,272 --> 00:23:26,527
Son of a bitch.

304
00:23:27,583 --> 00:23:29,524
You really kidnapped the little bastard.

305
00:23:34,171 --> 00:23:35,653
We ain't killin' him, Locke.

306
00:23:37,586 --> 00:23:38,919
Whatever you say, James.

307
00:23:58,582 --> 00:23:59,772
Well, well, well.

308
00:24:04,272 --> 00:24:06,139
What are you doing?!
Open the damn door!

309
00:24:06,423 --> 00:24:07,584
Shut up!

310
00:24:07,806 --> 00:24:08,958
Open up!

311
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:12,685
I said shut up!

312
00:24:18,664 --> 00:24:19,937
Who the hell are you?

313
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:26,810
- It's like a radio?
- It's like a radio, yes,

314
00:24:27,415 --> 00:24:29,652
but I've never seen
equipment this sophisticated.

315
00:24:30,042 --> 00:24:31,584
But you can still make it work, right?

316
00:24:31,727 --> 00:24:32,727
I hope so.

317
00:24:34,853 --> 00:24:36,301
And what about the other part?

318
00:24:37,290 --> 00:24:39,693
The part about they found the plane
and we're all dead?

319
00:24:40,416 --> 00:24:41,527
One thing at a time.

320
00:24:49,050 --> 00:24:50,888
There's not a single audible channel.

321
00:24:51,203 --> 00:24:52,863
Whatever that interference is,

322
00:24:53,064 --> 00:24:55,757
it's blocking our ability
to send our own transmission.

323
00:24:56,225 --> 00:24:57,225
If we...

324
00:24:57,538 --> 00:24:59,427
What's that? Is that a radio?

325
00:25:01,102 --> 00:25:02,157
Where'd you get it?

326
00:25:02,621 --> 00:25:03,691
Uh, the luggage.

327
00:25:04,042 --> 00:25:06,266
What, you just found a radio
in the luggage?

328
00:25:06,351 --> 00:25:10,707
Kate, if I explain,
I want you to keep this very quiet.

329
00:25:12,163 --> 00:25:13,329
Keep what very quiet?

330
00:25:16,305 --> 00:25:18,950
Locke! Open the damn door!

331
00:25:19,538 --> 00:25:22,847
Open it up! I can hear you,
you bald bastard!

332
00:25:28,789 --> 00:25:29,789
Rousseau?

333
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:32,100
Locke.

334
00:25:34,416 --> 00:25:36,043
What brings you to "The Black Rock"?

335
00:25:36,349 --> 00:25:38,374
Dynamite. And you?

336
00:25:38,955 --> 00:25:40,163
Open this door!

337
00:25:42,352 --> 00:25:43,352
Open up!

338
00:25:47,853 --> 00:25:49,408
Crates are right over there.

339
00:25:53,091 --> 00:25:54,337
Open this damn door!

340
00:25:54,475 --> 00:25:56,046
Be careful. It's unstable.

341
00:26:18,186 --> 00:26:19,417
It's beautiful, isn't it?

342
00:26:20,477 --> 00:26:22,437
No matter how much time
you spend on the island,

343
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,029
you just never get tired of this view.

344
00:26:24,226 --> 00:26:26,403
We haven't been formally introduced.

345
00:26:26,476 --> 00:26:27,476
I'm Richard.

346
00:26:29,599 --> 00:26:31,761
- You mind if I join you?
- Oh, sure.

347
00:26:38,789 --> 00:26:40,289
He wanted to embarrass you.

348
00:26:41,412 --> 00:26:42,412
I'm sorry?

349
00:26:42,726 --> 00:26:44,917
Ben knew you weren't gonna kill
your own father.

350
00:26:46,442 --> 00:26:47,623
He put you in front of

351
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:51,339
everyone in our camp
just so they could all watch you fail.

352
00:26:52,851 --> 00:26:53,851
Why?

353
00:26:57,666 --> 00:26:59,110
'cause when word got back here

354
00:26:59,175 --> 00:27:01,725
that there was a man
with a broken spine on the plane

355
00:27:01,801 --> 00:27:04,024
who could suddenly walk again, well...

356
00:27:04,288 --> 00:27:07,288
People here began to get very excited,
because that...

357
00:27:08,852 --> 00:27:11,782
That could only happen to someone
who was extremely special.

358
00:27:14,541 --> 00:27:17,433
Now Ben doesn't want anyone
to think you're special, John.

359
00:27:17,977 --> 00:27:19,358
And why are you telling me this?

360
00:27:21,081 --> 00:27:22,839
Ben has been wasting our time

361
00:27:22,888 --> 00:27:25,975
with novelties like fertility problems.

362
00:27:26,976 --> 00:27:29,237
We're looking for someone to remind us

363
00:27:29,323 --> 00:27:31,676
that we're here
for more important reasons.

364
00:27:33,726 --> 00:27:34,877
What do you want from me?

365
00:27:34,913 --> 00:27:38,529
I want for you to find your purpose,
and to do that,

366
00:27:39,477 --> 00:27:41,225
your father has to go, John,

367
00:27:42,609 --> 00:27:44,495
and since you're not going to do it...

368
00:27:50,990 --> 00:27:52,641
I'm gonna suggest someone else.

369
00:27:58,166 --> 00:27:59,166
Sawyer?

370
00:28:00,290 --> 00:28:02,900
Why would Sawyer kill my father?
He doesn't even know him.

371
00:28:03,099 --> 00:28:04,099
Keep reading.

372
00:28:09,228 --> 00:28:10,494
Open this damn door!

373
00:28:11,347 --> 00:28:12,612
Son of a bitch!

374
00:28:22,424 --> 00:28:24,272
I'm pointin' my gun at you, John-boy.

375
00:28:24,725 --> 00:28:26,798
You got three seconds to open this door!

376
00:28:27,869 --> 00:28:29,858
You're not gonna shoot anyone, James.

377
00:28:30,974 --> 00:28:31,974
One...

378
00:28:33,974 --> 00:28:34,974
two!

379
00:28:35,286 --> 00:28:36,842
If there were any bullets in that gun,

380
00:28:36,914 --> 00:28:38,922
why would you hold a knife to my throat?

381
00:28:43,565 --> 00:28:44,877
Son of a bitch!

382
00:28:45,813 --> 00:28:47,653
Guess I didn't raise no dummies.

383
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:49,640
What the hell's that mean?

384
00:28:49,753 --> 00:28:53,387
It means that "bald-headed bastard"
outside the door is my son.

385
00:28:55,813 --> 00:28:56,827
Come again?

386
00:28:56,947 --> 00:28:57,991
My son.

387
00:28:58,784 --> 00:29:00,594
As in I'm his father.

388
00:29:00,897 --> 00:29:02,170
You do speak English?

389
00:29:08,527 --> 00:29:10,638
How did you get here... to the island?

390
00:29:11,338 --> 00:29:12,338
Island?

391
00:29:14,776 --> 00:29:17,776
I'm driving down I-10
through Tallahassee, when bam...

392
00:29:18,401 --> 00:29:20,418
Somebody slams into the back of my car.

393
00:29:22,838 --> 00:29:25,621
I go right into the divider
at 70 miles an hour.

394
00:29:25,715 --> 00:29:26,937
The next thing I know,

395
00:29:27,244 --> 00:29:29,130
the paramedics are strapping me
to a gurney,

396
00:29:29,151 --> 00:29:30,776
stuffing me in the back of an ambulance,

397
00:29:30,777 --> 00:29:33,113
and one of them actually smiles at me

398
00:29:33,215 --> 00:29:36,803
as he pops the I.V. In my arm,
and then... nothing.

399
00:29:37,717 --> 00:29:39,286
Just black.

400
00:29:41,336 --> 00:29:43,900
And the next thing I know,
I wake up in a dark room

401
00:29:43,963 --> 00:29:46,796
tied up, gag in my mouth,
and when the door opens,

402
00:29:47,026 --> 00:29:50,257
I'm looking up at the same man
I threw out a window...

403
00:29:50,588 --> 00:29:52,234
John Locke,

404
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:55,124
my dead son.

405
00:30:05,429 --> 00:30:07,437
And he's dead 'cause you threw him
out a window?

406
00:30:07,525 --> 00:30:09,413
No, he survived that,

407
00:30:10,136 --> 00:30:12,652
but it paralyzed him, permanently.

408
00:30:14,086 --> 00:30:17,536
He's dead because the plane
he was flying on crashed in the Pacific.

409
00:30:21,604 --> 00:30:23,405
Well, I got bad news for you, pops,

410
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:25,755
'cause I was on that plane
with your son,

411
00:30:27,214 --> 00:30:28,903
and he sure as hell wasn't crippled.

412
00:30:29,437 --> 00:30:32,353
And we didn't crash in the pacific.
We crashed here on this island.

413
00:30:32,596 --> 00:30:34,111
You sure it's an island?

414
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:36,261
Well, what else is it?

415
00:30:36,475 --> 00:30:38,563
Little hot for heaven, isn't it?

416
00:30:41,164 --> 00:30:43,833
Oh, okay, so we're dead.

417
00:30:44,164 --> 00:30:46,749
They found your plane
on the bottom of the ocean.

418
00:30:48,382 --> 00:30:50,481
One minute I'm in a car wreck,
and the next minute

419
00:30:50,539 --> 00:30:52,683
I'm in a pirate ship
in the middle of the jungle?

420
00:30:52,724 --> 00:30:54,389
If ts isn't hell, friend...

421
00:30:56,158 --> 00:30:57,246
Then where are we?

422
00:31:03,790 --> 00:31:05,562
Why did you throw Locke out a window?

423
00:31:05,752 --> 00:31:07,450
He was becoming a nuisance.

424
00:31:10,291 --> 00:31:12,698
I conned him into giving me
one of his kidneys.

425
00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:14,205
He never got over it.

426
00:31:16,851 --> 00:31:17,851
Conned?

427
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:19,540
Yes, sir.

428
00:31:20,288 --> 00:31:21,288
Conned.

429
00:31:28,412 --> 00:31:29,466
What's your name?

430
00:31:30,719 --> 00:31:31,719
Your name?

431
00:31:32,468 --> 00:31:34,785
A con man goes by many names, friend.

432
00:31:35,844 --> 00:31:37,163
I've been Alan Seward,

433
00:31:37,626 --> 00:31:41,332
Anthony Cooper, Ten McLaren, Tom Sawyer,

434
00:31:41,717 --> 00:31:44,100
- Louis Jackson, Paul...
- Tom Sawyer?

435
00:31:45,906 --> 00:31:48,081
I was young, and "Huck Finn"
was taken...

436
00:31:48,939 --> 00:31:50,994
And the ladies loved that one.

437
00:31:51,653 --> 00:31:52,781
Made me charming.

438
00:31:57,780 --> 00:31:58,946
Well, how about that?

439
00:32:01,645 --> 00:32:02,778
How about what?

440
00:32:06,064 --> 00:32:07,823
Sawyer's my name, too.

441
00:32:30,596 --> 00:32:32,600
Ben, what's going on?

442
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:36,159
- We're moving.
- Moving? Where are we going?

443
00:32:36,287 --> 00:32:38,009
We are not going anywhere, John.

444
00:32:38,602 --> 00:32:40,172
You are going to stay behind.

445
00:32:40,539 --> 00:32:42,372
You both are going to stay behind.

446
00:32:43,571 --> 00:32:45,401
What? You're not taking him?

447
00:32:45,667 --> 00:32:48,369
He's your mess, John.
Why would we clean him up?

448
00:32:48,387 --> 00:32:50,980
Ben, if you're trying to put me
in my place, or embarrass me...

449
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:53,510
Where would you get
a ridiculous idea like that?

450
00:32:54,787 --> 00:32:56,175
Well, you can't leave me.

451
00:32:56,288 --> 00:32:59,600
- After everything, you can't just...
- Don't tell me what I can't do, John.

452
00:33:02,913 --> 00:33:04,980
But I thought I was... special.

453
00:33:08,163 --> 00:33:09,829
Well, everyone makes mistakes.

454
00:33:13,975 --> 00:33:14,975
We're leaving now.

455
00:33:16,101 --> 00:33:18,989
We'll leave a trail...
one you can track. And, John,

456
00:33:20,414 --> 00:33:23,235
unless you're carrying
your father's body on your back,

457
00:33:24,446 --> 00:33:25,515
don't bother.

458
00:33:58,826 --> 00:34:00,309
What's the matter with you?

459
00:34:02,163 --> 00:34:04,256
You ever been to Jasper, Alabama?

460
00:34:06,537 --> 00:34:07,537
Why?

461
00:34:08,288 --> 00:34:09,676
Have you, or haven't you?

462
00:34:11,662 --> 00:34:13,106
Yeah, I've been to Jasper.

463
00:34:14,372 --> 00:34:16,149
Don't tell me I'm your daddy.

464
00:34:17,784 --> 00:34:18,784
No.

465
00:34:20,907 --> 00:34:22,227
You killed my daddy.

466
00:34:43,783 --> 00:34:44,783
Read it.

467
00:34:52,222 --> 00:34:53,889
"Dear Mr. Sawyer... "

468
00:34:57,095 --> 00:34:58,924
- What is this?
- Just read it.

469
00:35:02,281 --> 00:35:06,338
"You don't know who I am,
but I know who you are,

470
00:35:07,722 --> 00:35:09,166
"and I know what you done.

471
00:35:10,469 --> 00:35:12,040
"You had sex with my mother

472
00:35:12,846 --> 00:35:16,062
"and then you stole
my dad's money all away,

473
00:35:16,595 --> 00:35:19,848
"so he got angry,
and he killed my mother... "

474
00:35:21,471 --> 00:35:23,397
"and then he killed himself... "

475
00:35:29,165 --> 00:35:30,291
So what?

476
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:33,840
Is this supposed to be you?
You wrote this letter?

477
00:35:35,588 --> 00:35:36,777
Hey, wait a second.

478
00:35:37,699 --> 00:35:38,965
Did you take my name

479
00:35:39,032 --> 00:35:41,524
because you were on some kind
of revenge kick?

480
00:35:43,655 --> 00:35:45,650
- Keep reading.
- Easy, easy.

481
00:35:46,509 --> 00:35:48,029
Don't get all worked up.

482
00:35:48,904 --> 00:35:52,422
Look, I ran that con two dozen times.

483
00:35:53,403 --> 00:35:55,675
- If your mother was one of the...
- Mary.

484
00:35:58,092 --> 00:35:59,329
Her name was Mary.

485
00:36:03,091 --> 00:36:05,197
Mary from Jasper, Alabama.

486
00:36:06,778 --> 00:36:09,317
Yeah, I remember her.

487
00:36:10,531 --> 00:36:14,197
She practically begged me
to take her $38,000

488
00:36:14,404 --> 00:36:17,226
and to rescue her
from her sorry little life.

489
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:20,502
You finish the letter.

490
00:36:20,965 --> 00:36:22,854
Look, I only took her money.

491
00:36:23,216 --> 00:36:25,570
It ain't my fault your dad overreacted.

492
00:36:25,905 --> 00:36:27,970
If he pulled the old murder-suicide,

493
00:36:28,091 --> 00:36:29,959
then I'm sure he's down here
somewhere.

494
00:36:30,092 --> 00:36:31,901
Maybe you could take this up with him.

495
00:36:31,966 --> 00:36:33,082
Finish it!

496
00:36:51,681 --> 00:36:53,042
You wanna go to hell?

497
00:36:53,975 --> 00:36:55,317
You wanna go to hell?!

498
00:37:45,153 --> 00:37:46,153
Thank you.

499
00:37:53,112 --> 00:37:54,772
You missing those cheeseburgers yet?

500
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:56,008
Only every second.

501
00:38:01,794 --> 00:38:02,954
I need to talk to you.

502
00:38:05,918 --> 00:38:07,987
- In private.
- No problem.

503
00:38:08,041 --> 00:38:10,451
Anything you wanna say to me,
you can say in front of her.

504
00:38:10,507 --> 00:38:11,545
Not this.

505
00:38:11,856 --> 00:38:14,390
- It's okay.
- No, no. You can stay.

506
00:38:16,831 --> 00:38:18,475
Yeah, you know what? You should stay.

507
00:38:19,304 --> 00:38:21,353
Seems only fair, considering
that she's the reason

508
00:38:21,354 --> 00:38:23,239
no one wants to tell you
that there's a woman

509
00:38:23,290 --> 00:38:26,158
in Hurley's tent who parachuted
onto the island yesterday.

510
00:38:26,604 --> 00:38:27,821
- What?
- A woman.

511
00:38:27,868 --> 00:38:29,842
She jumped from her chopper
before it crashed.

512
00:38:29,853 --> 00:38:31,705
She says that the boat
that she took off from

513
00:38:31,729 --> 00:38:34,246
is about 80 miles off the coast
and that if she can find a way

514
00:38:34,286 --> 00:38:35,863
to contact it, we'll all be rescued!

515
00:38:36,022 --> 00:38:37,332
Why didn't anyone tell me this?

516
00:38:39,578 --> 00:38:42,501
I already told you...
because they don't trust you.

517
00:38:50,980 --> 00:38:51,980
How?

518
00:38:52,973 --> 00:38:53,978
How what?

519
00:38:53,979 --> 00:38:55,666
How is she supposed to contact her boat?

520
00:38:55,667 --> 00:38:57,077
Did you hear what I just said?

521
00:38:57,204 --> 00:39:00,130
Hurley, Charlie, Sayid, your friends,
are afraid to...

522
00:39:01,547 --> 00:39:02,607
How?

523
00:39:07,293 --> 00:39:10,204
She had a phone-radio thing.

524
00:39:10,607 --> 00:39:12,169
Sayid's trying to get it to work.

525
00:39:15,562 --> 00:39:16,678
We should tell her.

526
00:39:19,855 --> 00:39:21,764
- No.
- Tell me what?

527
00:39:21,961 --> 00:39:24,269
- We should tell her.
- Not yet.

528
00:39:49,793 --> 00:39:51,038
You can go back now.

529
00:39:53,498 --> 00:39:54,920
Why did you do this?

530
00:39:57,044 --> 00:39:58,438
He ruined my life,

531
00:39:59,085 --> 00:40:00,507
and he ruined yours.

532
00:40:04,604 --> 00:40:05,770
And he had it coming.

533
00:40:10,848 --> 00:40:12,115
Juliet is a mole.

534
00:40:12,923 --> 00:40:14,879
- What?
- She's working for Ben.

535
00:40:15,330 --> 00:40:18,098
He sent her back to find out
which of our women were pregnant.

536
00:40:18,153 --> 00:40:20,499
Three days from now,
there's gonna be a raid on the beach,

537
00:40:20,546 --> 00:40:21,747
and they're gonna take them.

538
00:40:21,857 --> 00:40:24,088
They say they don't want anyone
to get hurt.

539
00:40:25,780 --> 00:40:27,375
Well, why are you telling me?

540
00:40:27,854 --> 00:40:30,441
- So you can warn the camp.
- You warn the camp.

541
00:40:32,356 --> 00:40:33,411
I'm not going back.

542
00:40:34,668 --> 00:40:36,097
You're going back undercover?

543
00:40:37,604 --> 00:40:39,492
No, I was never undercover, James.

544
00:40:40,934 --> 00:40:42,299
I'm on my own journey now.

545
00:40:45,268 --> 00:40:47,754
Even if Juliet is a mole,
they ain't gonna believe me.

546
00:40:47,830 --> 00:40:49,828
I been saying that since she showed up.

547
00:40:52,543 --> 00:40:53,795
They'll believe you now.

548
00:41:02,293 --> 00:41:03,293
Is it true?

549
00:41:05,229 --> 00:41:06,229
Is what true?

550
00:41:06,792 --> 00:41:08,625
That he threw you out a window...

551
00:41:11,980 --> 00:41:13,313
That you were a cripple?

552
00:41:17,229 --> 00:41:18,229
Not anymore.
