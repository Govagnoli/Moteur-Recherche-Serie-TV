1
00:00:00,233 --> 00:00:01,194
Previously on "Lost"...

2
00:00:01,224 --> 00:00:04,014
Hey, Locke. You have a message.
It's going on the raft.

3
00:00:04,087 --> 00:00:06,687
When they get rescued,
they can contact your family.

4
00:00:14,074 --> 00:00:15,307
- Michael!
- Jin!

5
00:00:31,218 --> 00:00:33,469
We were on a plane from
Sydney to Los Angeles.

6
00:00:33,499 --> 00:00:36,021
- Flight 815?
- You were on it?

7
00:00:38,124 --> 00:00:39,451
Back up!

8
00:00:41,368 --> 00:00:42,839
Coming out!

9
00:01:44,099 --> 00:01:44,996
Hi there, Hurley.

10
00:01:50,887 --> 00:01:52,455
Jin, you're here.

11
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,298
I sure am.

12
00:01:55,956 --> 00:01:57,662
Dude, you speak English.

13
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:00,611
No. You're speaking Korean.

14
00:02:02,299 --> 00:02:03,293
I am?

15
00:02:10,353 --> 00:02:13,018
What's he doing here?

16
00:02:14,699 --> 00:02:16,504
Everything's going to change.

17
00:02:17,906 --> 00:02:18,755
What?

18
00:02:20,487 --> 00:02:22,385
Everything's going to change.

19
00:02:26,359 --> 00:02:28,977
Have a cluckety-cluck-cluck
day, Hugo.

20
00:02:29,724 --> 00:02:30,668
Hurley!

21
00:02:35,576 --> 00:02:37,764
- You fell asleep?
- No, I was just...

22
00:02:39,353 --> 00:02:40,727
resting my eyes.

23
00:02:43,304 --> 00:02:44,787
The numbers are
written right there.

24
00:02:44,817 --> 00:02:47,625
Yeah. I remember the numbers.

25
00:02:49,308 --> 00:02:52,273
Locke went back to the beach,
so I'll be taking the next shift.

26
00:02:52,303 --> 00:02:53,534
Awesome.

27
00:02:54,516 --> 00:02:56,940
Jack told me about your job.

28
00:02:58,389 --> 00:03:00,480
At least we have
jobs again, right?

29
00:03:01,696 --> 00:03:03,357
Hooray for us.

30
00:03:12,757 --> 00:03:14,563
Well, ain't life grand?

31
00:03:20,548 --> 00:03:23,261
What I wouldn't give for
a cup of water right now.

32
00:03:31,071 --> 00:03:33,429
No way. No more human pyramids.

33
00:03:33,755 --> 00:03:35,131
Just forget it.

34
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:37,006
Hey!

35
00:03:38,314 --> 00:03:39,067
Hey!

36
00:03:39,862 --> 00:03:42,814
- Hey, let us out of here!
- Enough!

37
00:03:42,954 --> 00:03:44,566
- Hey!
- Chill!

38
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:48,481
Every minute I spend down here

39
00:03:48,808 --> 00:03:51,711
is another minute my
boy is still out there.

40
00:03:52,178 --> 00:03:54,891
Well, let me break it
down for you, Mike.

41
00:03:55,079 --> 00:03:58,983
Right now Rambina and her buddies are
trying to figure out what to do with us.

42
00:03:59,077 --> 00:04:03,078
Until they make up their damn mind,
there ain't nothin' we can do.

43
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:12,107
Yeah.

44
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:17,283
Why don't you pee on it?

45
00:04:27,008 --> 00:04:28,192
Grab the rope.

46
00:04:31,888 --> 00:04:32,736
Please.

47
00:04:39,798 --> 00:04:41,269
Don't do it.

48
00:04:48,427 --> 00:04:50,612
Climb the rope,
or I shoot your friends.

49
00:05:08,393 --> 00:05:09,570
You next.

50
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:12,716
Don't do it.

51
00:05:13,183 --> 00:05:14,511
She's bluffing.

52
00:05:15,911 --> 00:05:18,511
Gun's only got one bullet.
She ain't gonna waste it.

53
00:05:19,326 --> 00:05:20,791
Son of a bitch!

54
00:05:21,771 --> 00:05:23,193
Ohh! God!

55
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:24,423
Grab the rope.

56
00:05:39,484 --> 00:05:41,147
You want me, hot lips?

57
00:05:42,314 --> 00:05:44,264
Gonna have to come
down here and get...

58
00:05:45,752 --> 00:05:46,649
Bitch.

59
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:04,543
4, 8, 15, 16,
and 23 with the mega number 42.

60
00:06:04,636 --> 00:06:07,113
Whoever has those
numbers has won

61
00:06:07,202 --> 00:06:10,105
or will share in a
near-record jackpot.

62
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:14,106
That's right, Mary Jo, because this
is the 16th week without a winner.

63
00:06:16,611 --> 00:06:19,611
Hugo? Hu--

64
00:06:20,171 --> 00:06:21,928
Ay, Hugo. Hugo!

65
00:06:22,068 --> 00:06:24,734
Oh! Hugo, wake up. Wake up!

66
00:06:24,966 --> 00:06:25,911
Mom, stop.

67
00:06:26,003 --> 00:06:30,294
- I just slipped.
- Slipped sitting down?

68
00:06:30,386 --> 00:06:32,574
- Is it your heart?
- Ma, I'm fine.

69
00:06:32,854 --> 00:06:34,801
You're lying. I always know

70
00:06:34,895 --> 00:06:36,189
'cause you don't
look me in the eye.

71
00:06:36,219 --> 00:06:39,027
- I'm not lying.
- Then tell me what happened.

72
00:06:40,158 --> 00:06:40,903
Huh?

73
00:06:42,726 --> 00:06:43,530
Huh?

74
00:06:47,222 --> 00:06:49,122
It must have been
something I ate.

75
00:06:49,214 --> 00:06:52,120
Yes, it must be something you ate,
because you eat basura,

76
00:06:52,213 --> 00:06:54,545
- and you don't exercise.
- I do exercise.

77
00:06:54,589 --> 00:06:56,299
Falling down is not exercise.

78
00:06:56,424 --> 00:07:00,427
The only time you move is to lift
a drumstick from the bucket.

79
00:07:00,515 --> 00:07:02,365
Every day it's the
same thing, Hugo--

80
00:07:02,413 --> 00:07:04,696
work, then we eat chicken.

81
00:07:05,772 --> 00:07:08,246
You have to change
your life, Hugo.

82
00:07:08,553 --> 00:07:10,689
You think someone else
will change it for you?

83
00:07:10,719 --> 00:07:13,970
Maybe if you pray every day,
Jesus Christ will come down from heaven,

84
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,430
take 200 pounds and bring you
a decent woman and a new car.

85
00:07:17,522 --> 00:07:19,709
Yes, Jesus can
bring you a new car.

86
00:07:19,804 --> 00:07:23,477
Maybe I don't want to change.
Maybe I like my life.

87
00:07:25,435 --> 00:07:28,101
Oh! That must be Jesus.

88
00:07:32,831 --> 00:07:35,209
Hola. Un momento.

89
00:07:35,295 --> 00:07:39,393
Yes, it is Jesus! He wants to
know what color car you want.

90
00:07:49,032 --> 00:07:50,753
Hurley, pardon me.

91
00:07:51,349 --> 00:07:52,964
We need to have a little chat.

92
00:07:53,057 --> 00:07:56,215
Don't worry. Mommy's off for a walk,
so it's just you, me and the baby.

93
00:07:56,245 --> 00:07:57,380
Spill it.

94
00:07:57,659 --> 00:08:00,139
Uh... spill what?

95
00:08:01,581 --> 00:08:04,055
The hatch. What's in it?

96
00:08:05,083 --> 00:08:06,842
Uh, nothing, really.

97
00:08:08,243 --> 00:08:10,493
You've been out there
an entire day and night

98
00:08:10,945 --> 00:08:12,512
looking at nothing?

99
00:08:13,868 --> 00:08:15,293
Well, I guess it's...

100
00:08:15,571 --> 00:08:17,144
kind of like a bunker,

101
00:08:17,744 --> 00:08:20,982
you know, from world war II,
only newer.

102
00:08:21,591 --> 00:08:24,782
-  What's in it?
- I don't know.

103
00:08:25,578 --> 00:08:27,328
But somehow you
know it's a bunker.

104
00:08:28,781 --> 00:08:32,527
Well, I guess someone told me.

105
00:08:34,724 --> 00:08:36,440
You're gonna lie to me?

106
00:08:37,227 --> 00:08:39,318
You're gonna lie to the baby?

107
00:08:40,067 --> 00:08:41,489
Dude, look, I'd never lie.

108
00:08:41,582 --> 00:08:44,898
Oh,  and the time you told me
you were worth $150 million?

109
00:08:45,036 --> 00:08:47,376
- It was $156 million.
- I'm sorry.

110
00:08:47,506 --> 00:08:50,889
I must have confused it with the
$900 trillion I am worth myself.

111
00:08:52,104 --> 00:08:55,025
And this baby's made of chocolate
lollipops. So if you'll excuse us,

112
00:08:55,055 --> 00:08:57,455
I'm gonna flap my wings
and fly off this island.

113
00:09:22,938 --> 00:09:26,232
- Hey, Rose.
- Hey, yourself.

114
00:09:27,585 --> 00:09:30,190
So... doing laundry, huh?

115
00:09:30,283 --> 00:09:32,328
Indeed I am.

116
00:09:32,794 --> 00:09:35,344
You want to hand me those
dirty clothes over there?

117
00:09:39,995 --> 00:09:41,032
Thank you.

118
00:09:42,389 --> 00:09:44,239
Don't you want to
know what happened?

119
00:09:44,984 --> 00:09:46,217
What happened?

120
00:09:46,315 --> 00:09:47,445
You know, out there.

121
00:09:47,521 --> 00:09:49,571
Everyone's asking me
what's in the hatch.

122
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:52,165
Well, that's your
business, honey.

123
00:09:53,053 --> 00:09:54,670
Don't you want to know?

124
00:09:54,899 --> 00:09:59,792
Whatever it is, it's not gonna help
get this laundry done, now is it?

125
00:10:03,766 --> 00:10:08,343
Well, actually, it sort of is.

126
00:10:14,704 --> 00:10:16,414
It's around here somewhere.

127
00:10:53,345 --> 00:10:55,669
Someone actually
lived down here?

128
00:10:56,938 --> 00:10:57,937
Uh-huh.

129
00:11:00,224 --> 00:11:03,798
Well, what is it for?

130
00:11:05,068 --> 00:11:07,628
Uh, it's...
it's kind of a long story.

131
00:11:09,994 --> 00:11:11,000
Hurley...

132
00:11:11,321 --> 00:11:13,358
who else did you tell?

133
00:11:13,592 --> 00:11:14,488
No one.

134
00:11:15,517 --> 00:11:16,849
I swear.

135
00:11:17,123 --> 00:11:19,023
Dude, it's a big job.

136
00:11:19,257 --> 00:11:20,727
I needed...

137
00:11:21,252 --> 00:11:22,711
help.

138
00:11:22,804 --> 00:11:24,039
Hello,  Jack.

139
00:11:24,702 --> 00:11:25,778
Hey, Rose.

140
00:11:26,302 --> 00:11:27,047
She's cool.

141
00:11:27,139 --> 00:11:28,800
She won't tell anyone.

142
00:11:29,221 --> 00:11:31,850
Honey, I don't even
know what I would say.

143
00:12:23,617 --> 00:12:24,705
All this is food?

144
00:12:26,810 --> 00:12:30,968
It's only a matter of time before we
have to tell everyone what we found
down here.

145
00:12:31,316 --> 00:12:33,242
So you know what to do?

146
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:37,431
Inventory all of it and figure
out how we make it last.

147
00:12:37,731 --> 00:12:40,002
And in the meantime,
nobody gets anything.

148
00:12:40,092 --> 00:12:41,214
No exceptions.

149
00:12:41,303 --> 00:12:43,654
That's your responsibility,
Hurley. Okay?

150
00:12:45,224 --> 00:12:46,559
What's that?

151
00:12:46,643 --> 00:12:48,353
You don't want to know.

152
00:12:50,010 --> 00:12:51,925
"Dharma Initiative
salad dressing."

153
00:12:52,003 --> 00:12:53,855
"Ranch composite."

154
00:12:54,557 --> 00:12:56,043
Sounds tasty.

155
00:13:02,389 --> 00:13:05,390
Apollo bars?
You ever hear of these?

156
00:13:05,996 --> 00:13:08,430
Unh-unh. But candy is candy.

157
00:13:08,515 --> 00:13:10,559
That's what Bernard
always says.

158
00:13:11,353 --> 00:13:13,411
Talk about a sweet tooth.

159
00:13:14,174 --> 00:13:17,652
That man has a mouthful
of sweet teeth.

160
00:13:17,747 --> 00:13:19,551
Bernard-- that
was your husband?

161
00:13:19,971 --> 00:13:21,921
Is my husband.

162
00:13:22,246 --> 00:13:23,431
Oh, but...

163
00:13:23,671 --> 00:13:25,852
I thought he was in
the back of the plane.

164
00:13:28,899 --> 00:13:30,420
I'm sorry. I didn't mean--

165
00:13:30,457 --> 00:13:32,514
No, no. That's okay.
Don't feel bad.

166
00:13:32,593 --> 00:13:34,670
Bernard is fine. I know it.

167
00:13:35,321 --> 00:13:37,365
You want to get
the canned tuna?

168
00:13:45,058 --> 00:13:46,608
Everyone's gonna hate me, Rose.

169
00:13:47,965 --> 00:13:50,097
Now that's just plain silly.

170
00:13:50,937 --> 00:13:54,037
You're about the only one on this
island that everybody loves.

171
00:13:55,948 --> 00:13:57,528
Well, that'll change.

172
00:13:58,262 --> 00:14:00,512
Hey, you guys happen to
find any shampoo in here?

173
00:14:00,542 --> 00:14:03,121
Uh, yeah.
There's some right over here.

174
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:08,740
Uh, Kate, you can't take it.

175
00:14:08,838 --> 00:14:10,544
Thanks, Hurley.

176
00:14:12,976 --> 00:14:14,828
It's just one bottle.

177
00:14:15,138 --> 00:14:17,229
That's where it starts.

178
00:14:20,737 --> 00:14:23,211
Welcome to Mr. Cluck's.
Can I take your order?

179
00:14:28,451 --> 00:14:29,538
Hey, Hugo.

180
00:14:33,234 --> 00:14:34,369
You okay, man?

181
00:14:35,257 --> 00:14:37,399
Yeah. Fine.

182
00:14:38,713 --> 00:14:42,138
Reyes! My office! Now.

183
00:14:47,704 --> 00:14:49,554
You want to tell me
something, Reyes?

184
00:14:53,072 --> 00:14:55,412
Uh... no.

185
00:14:56,236 --> 00:14:58,012
You sure about that?

186
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:02,422
Uh... yeah.

187
00:15:03,974 --> 00:15:06,058
This is last night's
surveillance tape.

188
00:15:15,899 --> 00:15:19,120
Reyes, you owe the company for
an 8-piece dark meat combo.

189
00:15:19,167 --> 00:15:20,467
I didn't eat eight pieces.

190
00:15:20,493 --> 00:15:22,154
You want to watch
the whole tape?

191
00:15:22,387 --> 00:15:25,004
Oh, and while you're here,
how many times

192
00:15:25,098 --> 00:15:28,909
do I gotta tell you
those napkins cost money?

193
00:15:28,955 --> 00:15:30,547
All right?
It's two per customer.

194
00:15:30,577 --> 00:15:33,665
Two. We're not made of money here at Mr.
Cluck's, Reyes.

195
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:36,189
I'm not made of money.
Are you made of money?

196
00:15:36,278 --> 00:15:38,912
'Cause if you're made of money,
maybe you don't wanna work here.

197
00:15:38,942 --> 00:15:41,272
So get it together.

198
00:15:41,510 --> 00:15:43,788
What, is that a problem, Reyes?

199
00:15:54,361 --> 00:15:55,736
Dude, I quit.

200
00:15:58,871 --> 00:16:00,112
Oh, my god.

201
00:16:01,841 --> 00:16:03,495
- Oh, my god.
- Dude!

202
00:16:03,868 --> 00:16:05,269
Are you okay?

203
00:16:05,665 --> 00:16:07,374
I'm... I'm fine.

204
00:16:07,654 --> 00:16:09,354
Randy's losing his
brain in there.

205
00:16:09,383 --> 00:16:10,466
Well, you should
get back in there.

206
00:16:10,496 --> 00:16:12,586
They'll have you scrubbing
johns for the rest of the week.

207
00:16:12,616 --> 00:16:14,852
Doubt it. I quit, too.

208
00:16:15,552 --> 00:16:16,387
What?

209
00:16:16,634 --> 00:16:18,662
Looks like we got
ourselves a day off.

210
00:16:19,876 --> 00:16:22,478
Who needs money when
you got good looks?

211
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,878
You can come out now.

212
00:16:54,421 --> 00:16:55,845
I saw you back at the rock

213
00:16:56,836 --> 00:16:58,489
and then at the mangrove tree.

214
00:16:59,989 --> 00:17:01,886
In fact,
I've walked in a big circle.

215
00:17:02,026 --> 00:17:03,976
I'm not sure how you
didn't realize it.

216
00:17:10,708 --> 00:17:11,723
All right.

217
00:17:12,824 --> 00:17:14,224
You don't have to insult me.

218
00:17:18,455 --> 00:17:21,155
Want to tell me why you've
been following me, Charlie?

219
00:17:21,759 --> 00:17:22,370
Yeah.

220
00:17:24,487 --> 00:17:25,802
Quite simply, John,

221
00:17:26,431 --> 00:17:28,501
there are a lot of
secrets around here.

222
00:17:28,829 --> 00:17:31,279
And I'm tired of being at
the bloody kids' table.

223
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,258
I got Claire's baby back.

224
00:17:33,404 --> 00:17:36,620
I didn't go swanning off to "the black
rock" on a bloody A-team mission,

225
00:17:36,650 --> 00:17:40,188
but I would have if
someone had asked me.

226
00:17:40,408 --> 00:17:43,258
I think I'm entitled to some
sodding answers around here.

227
00:17:46,114 --> 00:17:47,364
What do you want to know?

228
00:17:56,938 --> 00:17:57,883
How's it going?

229
00:17:59,191 --> 00:17:59,905
It's not.

230
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:03,609
On the other side of this
door there's more concrete.

231
00:18:03,834 --> 00:18:06,359
I'd say it's at least
8 to 10 feet thick.

232
00:18:07,198 --> 00:18:08,479
You see this?

233
00:18:12,893 --> 00:18:15,732
Interesting. Good
thing this is titanium.

234
00:18:16,105 --> 00:18:18,437
Almost no magnetic attraction.

235
00:18:19,652 --> 00:18:21,552
But we're not going
to get in up here.

236
00:18:21,924 --> 00:18:23,172
Up here?

237
00:18:29,472 --> 00:18:31,183
Perhaps we can go under it.

238
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:49,351
Grab the rope.

239
00:18:49,772 --> 00:18:53,059
I ain't doing nothing till
I know my friends are okay.

240
00:18:53,203 --> 00:18:55,051
So we friends now, huh?

241
00:18:58,888 --> 00:19:01,509
Do it now,
or the rope comes up.

242
00:19:10,423 --> 00:19:11,749
Howdy, boys.

243
00:19:12,124 --> 00:19:14,598
- Thanks for the rescue.
- Everything is cool.

244
00:19:14,745 --> 00:19:17,521
We had a talk, and they believe
we were on the plane, too.

245
00:19:17,551 --> 00:19:21,513
Swell. I guess we can
all sue Oceanic together.

246
00:19:23,557 --> 00:19:24,842
What you got there?

247
00:19:26,988 --> 00:19:27,956
Nothin'.

248
00:19:28,073 --> 00:19:30,323
You got a rock?
You looking for some revenge?

249
00:19:30,645 --> 00:19:32,295
You got three
seconds to drop it.

250
00:19:32,343 --> 00:19:34,004
- Ana.
- One.

251
00:19:34,190 --> 00:19:35,424
Two.

252
00:19:35,545 --> 00:19:36,754
Now hold on--

253
00:19:37,212 --> 00:19:38,592
Hey! Hey, what's...

254
00:19:43,765 --> 00:19:45,523
You didn't say "three."

255
00:19:45,989 --> 00:19:48,896
Shut up. When I tell you to
do something, you do it.

256
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:50,565
I say move, you move.

257
00:19:50,645 --> 00:19:52,325
I say stop, you stop.

258
00:19:52,428 --> 00:19:53,947
I say jump, what do you say?

259
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:55,326
You first.

260
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:56,984
You don't like the rules,

261
00:19:57,014 --> 00:20:00,445
I toss your ass back in the
pit right now. You understand?

262
00:20:02,101 --> 00:20:03,484
I  understand.

263
00:20:11,926 --> 00:20:13,726
It's getting dark.
We're moving out.

264
00:20:16,535 --> 00:20:17,825
Moving out where?

265
00:20:17,978 --> 00:20:19,234
What did I just tell you?

266
00:20:20,684 --> 00:20:22,490
Sorry. I forgot.

267
00:20:22,769 --> 00:20:24,686
There's just one
thing, though--

268
00:20:25,258 --> 00:20:28,872
you hit me again,
I'll kill you.

269
00:20:32,209 --> 00:20:33,116
Let's go.

270
00:21:00,487 --> 00:21:04,400
He pushed that button
every 108 minutes?

271
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:06,108
He did indeed.

272
00:21:06,221 --> 00:21:08,519
But how is that possible?
I mean, didn't he sleep?

273
00:21:08,549 --> 00:21:11,215
Don't know.
Didn't get a chance to ask him.

274
00:21:12,105 --> 00:21:13,915
And after all that time,
he just up and left?

275
00:21:13,945 --> 00:21:15,519
I mean, why? Where did he go?

276
00:21:15,596 --> 00:21:16,830
Don't know.

277
00:21:17,526 --> 00:21:20,346
I tried to track him,
but he didn't leave much of a trail.

278
00:21:20,376 --> 00:21:23,048
I guess he figured he'd
found his replacements.

279
00:21:23,133 --> 00:21:25,372
- Meaning us.
- Meaning us.

280
00:21:27,546 --> 00:21:32,098
It sounds a bit nutty.
Doesn't it?

281
00:21:32,518 --> 00:21:34,418
It is what it is, Charlie.

282
00:21:35,334 --> 00:21:37,589
And what happens if
we don't push it?

283
00:21:37,683 --> 00:21:40,921
We're not going to find out.
I'm setting up a system.

284
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:43,123
I'm still working on it,
but it looks like it's going to be

285
00:21:43,153 --> 00:21:45,291
2-person shifts
every 6 hours or so.

286
00:21:45,385 --> 00:21:46,714
Shifts?

287
00:21:47,834 --> 00:21:49,380
Pushing a button?

288
00:21:49,632 --> 00:21:52,644
Oh, and there's
a record player.

289
00:21:57,759 --> 00:21:59,654
What's Hurley been doing there?

290
00:22:00,125 --> 00:22:02,023
He's in charge of the food.

291
00:22:03,637 --> 00:22:04,796
Food?

292
00:22:18,757 --> 00:22:19,629
Hey, mate.

293
00:22:21,899 --> 00:22:22,746
Where you been?

294
00:22:22,869 --> 00:22:25,890
Hey. I've been... around.

295
00:22:27,073 --> 00:22:28,382
I know, Hurley.

296
00:22:29,791 --> 00:22:30,779
You know what?

297
00:22:30,872 --> 00:22:33,149
I know about the food.
Locke told me everything.

298
00:22:33,179 --> 00:22:35,151
- Yeah, well, Locke's lying.
- Oh, yeah?

299
00:22:35,243 --> 00:22:38,855
Is  he lying about the button we have to
push every 108 minutes or the island
will explode?

300
00:22:38,885 --> 00:22:40,921
- It's not gonna explode.
- Ah!

301
00:22:41,955 --> 00:22:42,738
Come  on.

302
00:22:42,851 --> 00:22:44,172
Look, Jack put me in charge.

303
00:22:44,202 --> 00:22:46,652
- I don't even want to--
- Is there peanut butter?

304
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:47,896
What?

305
00:22:47,988 --> 00:22:48,843
Peanut butter.

306
00:22:48,931 --> 00:22:52,135
Nutty, creamy,
staple of children everywhere?

307
00:22:52,589 --> 00:22:54,872
Uh, yeah. A couple jars.

308
00:22:55,017 --> 00:22:57,035
Thrilling. How about
you give us one?

309
00:22:59,584 --> 00:23:01,108
It's for Claire.

310
00:23:02,146 --> 00:23:03,633
No can do, man.

311
00:23:04,112 --> 00:23:06,419
You're saying no to
a nursing mother?

312
00:23:06,513 --> 00:23:08,591
- It's not like that.
- Oh, it's exactly like that.

313
00:23:08,621 --> 00:23:10,442
You know, I never thought this
would happen, but it did.

314
00:23:10,472 --> 00:23:11,799
You've become one of them.

315
00:23:12,734 --> 00:23:13,604
One of them?

316
00:23:13,724 --> 00:23:16,343
Them-- the man. Management.

317
00:23:16,813 --> 00:23:20,958
Thought we were friends.
You've changed, man.

318
00:23:39,302 --> 00:23:42,019
Drive Shaft.
More like "suck shaft."

319
00:23:42,763 --> 00:23:45,433
I'm gonna go check
out the headphones.

320
00:23:46,456 --> 00:23:48,655
Sure. Headphones.

321
00:23:50,262 --> 00:23:52,326
- Hugo.
- Starla.

322
00:23:52,419 --> 00:23:54,078
Why aren't you
chuckleheads at work?

323
00:23:54,108 --> 00:23:56,408
We're currently exploring
other opportunities.

324
00:23:56,685 --> 00:23:59,189
- You quit?
- I did.

325
00:23:59,299 --> 00:24:01,775
He's mixing it up today.
He's off the rails.

326
00:24:01,819 --> 00:24:03,529
Somebody get a straitjacket!

327
00:24:03,623 --> 00:24:04,823
Hey, can I try those on?

328
00:24:04,851 --> 00:24:07,469
You're messing with my
worldview here, Hugo.

329
00:24:07,562 --> 00:24:08,748
You're my rock.

330
00:24:08,886 --> 00:24:11,328
I mean, if you quit your job,
the next thing you know,

331
00:24:11,358 --> 00:24:15,029
bees will stop making
honey and flowers will die,

332
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:17,800
and, hell,
the whole damn thing will fall apart.

333
00:24:19,042 --> 00:24:20,526
So, Starla...

334
00:24:22,664 --> 00:24:23,387
Oh.

335
00:24:25,523 --> 00:24:28,448
I'm sorry. Uh, well,

336
00:24:28,708 --> 00:24:32,186
the hold steady's playing
the troubadour this weekend,

337
00:24:32,447 --> 00:24:34,756
and I was wondering
if maybe friday...

338
00:24:35,009 --> 00:24:37,486
Um... I have to work.

339
00:24:37,998 --> 00:24:39,184
Oh, no. I didn't mean--

340
00:24:39,237 --> 00:24:42,190
I could probably go saturday.
Is that cool?

341
00:24:44,241 --> 00:24:47,430
Yeah. That's totally cool.

342
00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:51,442
Dude, you've been crushing on this
girl for months and doing nothing.

343
00:24:51,472 --> 00:24:53,830
Today you're freakin' Fabio.

344
00:24:53,973 --> 00:24:56,375
Seriously, man,
what has gotten into you?

345
00:24:56,488 --> 00:24:58,889
Nothing. I just wanted
to ask her out before...

346
00:24:59,332 --> 00:25:00,660
Before what?

347
00:25:01,225 --> 00:25:02,812
Nothing.

348
00:25:04,284 --> 00:25:06,137
This is the last duct.

349
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:08,580
I believe we're under
the area where we began.

350
00:25:09,490 --> 00:25:11,890
They poured concrete all
the way down here, too.

351
00:25:18,578 --> 00:25:19,833
Just as thick.

352
00:25:21,636 --> 00:25:23,136
Maybe there's a way around it.

353
00:25:29,695 --> 00:25:31,095
What is all this stuff here?

354
00:25:31,864 --> 00:25:33,134
My best guess?

355
00:25:34,123 --> 00:25:36,775
There's a geothermal
generator behind this wall.

356
00:25:36,868 --> 00:25:38,391
That's the power source.

357
00:25:47,698 --> 00:25:48,979
Careful with these pipes.

358
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:51,201
They're very hot.

359
00:25:56,402 --> 00:25:57,263
That's it.

360
00:25:57,938 --> 00:26:00,603
Nothing. It's blocked.

361
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,765
So what do you think, Sayid?

362
00:26:08,024 --> 00:26:09,748
What do I think
about what, Jack?

363
00:26:09,903 --> 00:26:14,646
This place, the computer.
What do you think is going on?

364
00:26:15,862 --> 00:26:19,756
The last time I heard of concrete being
poured over everything in this way

365
00:26:20,243 --> 00:26:21,660
was Chernobyl.

366
00:26:28,443 --> 00:26:31,190
- Did you hit something?
- I don't think so.

367
00:26:33,215 --> 00:26:34,932
It's coming from over there.

368
00:26:36,708 --> 00:26:38,008
I'm going to check it out.

369
00:26:58,433 --> 00:26:59,191
Hey.

370
00:27:00,658 --> 00:27:01,221
Hey.

371
00:27:04,221 --> 00:27:06,384
You, um, you took a shower.

372
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:08,206
I had to see if it worked.

373
00:27:10,623 --> 00:27:11,723
How was it?

374
00:27:12,927 --> 00:27:18,219
Uh, the pressure sucked,
and it kind of went cold at one point,

375
00:27:18,359 --> 00:27:20,559
and it smelled a little
bit like sulfur, but

376
00:27:21,261 --> 00:27:22,453
it was a shower.

377
00:27:22,541 --> 00:27:24,162
Yeah. I know what you mean.

378
00:27:26,627 --> 00:27:28,037
You could use one.

379
00:27:30,050 --> 00:27:31,518
Maybe a little later.

380
00:27:32,215 --> 00:27:33,947
I'll leave the shampoo for you.

381
00:27:49,325 --> 00:27:51,555
- I'm Libby.
- Michael.

382
00:27:52,852 --> 00:27:54,588
How many of you?

383
00:27:54,669 --> 00:27:56,808
You know,
on the other side of the island?

384
00:27:57,551 --> 00:28:03,457
When we left, around 40.
How many of you survived?

385
00:28:04,377 --> 00:28:06,151
23 of us.

386
00:28:15,277 --> 00:28:16,511
Are you all right?

387
00:28:17,964 --> 00:28:19,729
Now you give a damn.

388
00:28:20,841 --> 00:28:24,653
I said I'm sorry.
It was a misunderstanding.

389
00:28:25,402 --> 00:28:28,720
Misunderstanding is when you bring
me lemonade instead of iced tea.

390
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:32,033
- I said no talking.
- He was talking to me.

391
00:28:32,908 --> 00:28:34,215
We're here.

392
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:38,721
What are you gonna do,
beam us up?

393
00:29:34,242 --> 00:29:36,477
I thought you said
there were 23 of you.

394
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:38,881
There were.

395
00:29:59,123 --> 00:29:59,948
Hi, Sun.

396
00:30:04,908 --> 00:30:05,822
What's wrong?

397
00:30:09,877 --> 00:30:12,595
I, uh...
I found something out in the water,

398
00:30:12,684 --> 00:30:14,557
and I told Shannon about it,

399
00:30:14,734 --> 00:30:17,707
and we thought you should know.

400
00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:26,721
It's the messages
from the raft.

401
00:30:31,681 --> 00:30:33,681
We thought you should
decide what to do.

402
00:30:42,458 --> 00:30:43,958
Why did you tell Charlie, man?

403
00:30:45,436 --> 00:30:46,670
Because he asked, Hugo.

404
00:30:46,975 --> 00:30:48,198
Yeah, well, you shouldn't have.

405
00:30:48,228 --> 00:30:50,340
You should have listened to me
about coming down here, period.

406
00:30:50,370 --> 00:30:53,199
Now it's all gonna
change. Everything.

407
00:30:53,505 --> 00:30:55,405
Change is good, Hugo.

408
00:30:55,499 --> 00:30:57,972
You know, people say that,

409
00:30:58,065 --> 00:31:00,641
but it's not true, man.
Trust me, I know.

410
00:31:00,728 --> 00:31:02,362
And guess who gets
to be the bad guy,

411
00:31:02,392 --> 00:31:04,306
who has to say, "no,
you can't have peanut butter

412
00:31:04,336 --> 00:31:07,602
for the cute blonde and
her poor island baby"?

413
00:31:07,690 --> 00:31:09,137
You know who? It's me.

414
00:31:11,958 --> 00:31:13,990
You know what?
I'm not gonna do it.

415
00:31:14,082 --> 00:31:15,734
Find someone else to
deal with the chow, man.

416
00:31:15,764 --> 00:31:18,131
No. We all have our jobs, Hugo.

417
00:31:18,277 --> 00:31:21,283
My job is to convince people to
push a button every 108 minutes

418
00:31:21,313 --> 00:31:24,188
without them knowing
why or for what.

419
00:31:26,881 --> 00:31:27,991
Want to trade?

420
00:31:28,014 --> 00:31:29,243
I don't want to do this, man!

421
00:31:29,273 --> 00:31:31,471
I've had a lot of jobs
that I didn't want to do.

422
00:31:31,501 --> 00:31:32,972
I still did 'em.

423
00:31:33,830 --> 00:31:35,671
I'm sorry, Hugo.

424
00:31:37,258 --> 00:31:39,159
You don't get to quit.

425
00:31:42,807 --> 00:31:43,992
Okay, then.

426
00:32:15,721 --> 00:32:18,396
- Be careful!
- Dude, I am.

427
00:32:19,061 --> 00:32:20,899
- You got it?
- Yeah, I got it.

428
00:32:20,986 --> 00:32:22,911
All right. Let's go!

429
00:32:26,579 --> 00:32:28,067
You think we got enough gnomes?

430
00:32:28,097 --> 00:32:29,117
Okay, we're good.

431
00:32:35,571 --> 00:32:36,899
This is genius.

432
00:32:37,224 --> 00:32:40,021
No, not to the left, dude.
More of an angle.

433
00:32:40,219 --> 00:32:41,070
Hey!

434
00:32:41,309 --> 00:32:42,238
Run!

435
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:56,896
Whoo! Freedom!

436
00:32:57,083 --> 00:32:58,996
- Dude, what are you doing?
- Freedom!

437
00:33:00,485 --> 00:33:02,307
So anything else you
want to do tonight?

438
00:33:02,337 --> 00:33:03,787
You'd better let me know now,

439
00:33:04,131 --> 00:33:06,812
'cause our day off is just about over,
huggy bear.

440
00:33:07,591 --> 00:33:08,633
In about ten hours,

441
00:33:08,726 --> 00:33:11,476
we're gonna have to find
ourselves some new employment.

442
00:33:11,621 --> 00:33:13,711
I hear pizza bin is hiring,

443
00:33:13,805 --> 00:33:17,273
or we could try our luck at,
uh, gyrorama.

444
00:33:17,361 --> 00:33:20,090
But I do kind of dig the
chick who works at the bin.

445
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:22,713
Dude, promise me something.

446
00:33:23,518 --> 00:33:24,509
Okay, what?

447
00:33:25,686 --> 00:33:28,717
Promise me that no
matter what happens,

448
00:33:29,091 --> 00:33:30,610
we'll never change--

449
00:33:30,702 --> 00:33:32,312
This will never change.

450
00:33:32,475 --> 00:33:33,683
Okay.

451
00:33:34,230 --> 00:33:36,047
Oh. I know what this is about.

452
00:33:36,141 --> 00:33:38,441
I know why you've been
acting so weird lately.

453
00:33:38,606 --> 00:33:40,578
You're getting that, uh...
that, uh...

454
00:33:40,655 --> 00:33:43,784
stomach-stapling surgery thing,
aren't you?

455
00:33:43,848 --> 00:33:46,357
- I'm not getting surgery.
- Come on, man, it's cool.

456
00:33:46,387 --> 00:33:48,033
I mean,
I can still be all surprised.

457
00:33:48,063 --> 00:33:51,975
I could be like, "ooh!
My, Hurley! Wow, is that you?"

458
00:33:52,138 --> 00:33:53,635
Listen, Johnny, I'm serious.

459
00:33:53,812 --> 00:33:59,779
Promise me that you and I
will always stay the same.

460
00:33:59,871 --> 00:34:01,196
I'll do you one better.

461
00:34:01,342 --> 00:34:05,213
Not only will I stay,
Gold Pony Boy, I will drink to it.

462
00:34:06,942 --> 00:34:08,768
Can I borrow 2 bucks?

463
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:28,290
What you got there, Hurley?

464
00:34:30,044 --> 00:34:30,881
Uh...

465
00:34:33,470 --> 00:34:34,773
it's dynamite.

466
00:34:35,408 --> 00:34:38,021
Dynamite? Well,what
are you doing with it?

467
00:34:41,012 --> 00:34:43,797
I'm sorry,
but I can't let it happen again.

468
00:34:53,742 --> 00:34:55,754
Why is there a news crew here?

469
00:34:57,516 --> 00:34:58,970
Dude, we shouldn't go here.

470
00:35:00,483 --> 00:35:03,503
Dude, let's go.
They jack the prices here.

471
00:35:03,623 --> 00:35:05,114
Maybe somebody got shot.

472
00:35:18,315 --> 00:35:20,555
Why are you doing this, honey?

473
00:35:20,948 --> 00:35:22,594
Look, just get
outta here, Rose.

474
00:35:22,675 --> 00:35:24,510
But you're gonna hurt somebody.

475
00:35:24,663 --> 00:35:26,513
Not if I do it from
outside the door.

476
00:35:26,582 --> 00:35:27,451
It's thick.

477
00:35:27,566 --> 00:35:29,720
And I'll make sure there's
nobody around first.

478
00:35:29,750 --> 00:35:31,793
So please, will you just go?

479
00:35:31,887 --> 00:35:35,567
Unh-unh. You haul me off of the beach,
and you drag me into this place.

480
00:35:35,919 --> 00:35:39,155
The least I can get is an
explanation before you blow it up.

481
00:35:39,263 --> 00:35:40,610
You don't get it!

482
00:35:40,729 --> 00:35:42,635
This is gonna mess it all up!

483
00:35:48,738 --> 00:35:51,336
Dude, somebody won the lottery!

484
00:35:51,410 --> 00:35:52,798
Let me tell you
something, Rose.

485
00:35:52,828 --> 00:35:55,506
We were all fine
before we had any...

486
00:35:56,447 --> 00:35:57,489
potato chips.

487
00:35:57,589 --> 00:35:59,289
But now we got
these potato chips,

488
00:35:59,497 --> 00:36:01,129
and everyone's gonna want 'em.

489
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:03,345
So Steve gets 'em.
Charlie's pissed.

490
00:36:03,504 --> 00:36:06,246
But he's not pissed at Steve.
He's pissed at me.

491
00:36:06,418 --> 00:36:07,534
That's the guy!

492
00:36:09,238 --> 00:36:10,524
That's the guy!

493
00:36:15,427 --> 00:36:17,277
And I'm gonna be in
the middle of it,

494
00:36:17,283 --> 00:36:18,697
and then it's gonna be,

495
00:36:18,777 --> 00:36:22,087
"What about us?
Why didn't I get any potato chips?

496
00:36:22,273 --> 00:36:25,099
Come on, help us out, Hurley.
Why'd you give Kate the shampoo?

497
00:36:25,129 --> 00:36:27,129
And why didn't I get
the peanut butter?"

498
00:36:27,874 --> 00:36:30,939
Then they'll get really
mad and start asking,

499
00:36:31,033 --> 00:36:32,588
"Why does Hugo have everything?

500
00:36:32,673 --> 00:36:34,237
Why should he get to decide?"

501
00:36:34,319 --> 00:36:36,473
Then they'll all hate me.

502
00:36:40,965 --> 00:36:42,472
I don't know what to do.

503
00:37:06,081 --> 00:37:08,996
Come on, Jack. The inventory's done.
This is the only way.

504
00:37:09,108 --> 00:37:10,711
Are you serious?

505
00:37:10,907 --> 00:37:12,442
Dude, there's enough
food in there

506
00:37:12,472 --> 00:37:16,046
to feed one guy three meals a
day for another three months.

507
00:37:16,138 --> 00:37:18,934
We have 40 people.
It's just not gonna work.

508
00:37:20,170 --> 00:37:22,820
Look, you put me in charge.
This is what we're doing.

509
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:26,161
Okay.

510
00:37:28,374 --> 00:37:29,592
Okay?

511
00:37:30,050 --> 00:37:32,849
Yeah. Okay.

512
00:37:37,993 --> 00:37:39,105
Okay.

513
00:40:48,517 --> 00:40:50,561
Uh, excuse me.

514
00:40:51,310 --> 00:40:52,827
Hi.

515
00:40:55,541 --> 00:40:57,574
Back where you guys, uh...

516
00:40:58,597 --> 00:41:02,742
where you came from,
is there a woman named Rose there?

517
00:41:05,333 --> 00:41:07,387
Black chick in her 50s?

518
00:41:11,448 --> 00:41:12,805
Is she...

519
00:41:13,946 --> 00:41:15,573
is she okay?

520
00:41:16,685 --> 00:41:18,108
Yeah, man.

521
00:41:19,183 --> 00:41:20,280
She's okay.

522
00:41:20,866 --> 00:41:21,879
Oh!

523
00:41:23,792 --> 00:41:25,693
Oh, thank you.

524
00:41:26,939 --> 00:41:28,984
Michael. I'm Michael.

525
00:41:29,748 --> 00:41:31,865
Thank you, Michael.

526
00:41:32,869 --> 00:41:34,722
I'm Bernard.

527
00:41:42,927 --> 00:41:43,805
Okay.

528
00:41:44,275 --> 00:41:47,812
It's okay. She's fine.
