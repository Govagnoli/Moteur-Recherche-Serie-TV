<i>Previously on</i> Lost...

2
00:00:02,026 --> 00:00:03,040
Is that an helicopter?

3
00:00:03,142 --> 00:00:04,815
It's how an helicopter suppose to sound?

4
00:00:05,734 --> 00:00:06,734
Get away from her!

5
00:00:08,836 --> 00:00:09,836
Desmond.

6
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:15,446
- What's wrong?
- What's wrong is I'm married.

7
00:00:15,648 --> 00:00:16,648
Right.

8
00:00:32,308 --> 00:00:33,376
You're pregnant.

9
00:01:05,244 --> 00:01:06,267
Good morning, Jack.

10
00:01:07,246 --> 00:01:08,303
You need a hand?

11
00:01:09,496 --> 00:01:10,496
Thank you.

12
00:01:17,836 --> 00:01:19,575
I came by your tent earlier.

13
00:01:20,933 --> 00:01:21,933
Is Jin gone?

14
00:01:23,647 --> 00:01:26,090
He went off with Charlie,
Hurley and Desmond.

15
00:01:26,809 --> 00:01:27,809
Did you need him?

16
00:01:28,494 --> 00:01:30,271
Actually, I was looking for you.

17
00:01:30,527 --> 00:01:33,748
I wanted to see how you were doing
with your pregnancy.

18
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:37,498
I'm doing fine.

19
00:01:38,508 --> 00:01:40,785
A little tired, but that's normal,
right?

20
00:01:40,942 --> 00:01:41,942
Sure.

21
00:01:42,973 --> 00:01:44,139
Any morning sickness?

22
00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:45,470
Not anymore.

23
00:01:46,573 --> 00:01:47,657
Any bleeding?

24
00:01:52,158 --> 00:01:54,824
Why are you asking me
all these questions, Jack?

25
00:01:56,417 --> 00:01:57,564
I'm just checking in.

26
00:01:58,909 --> 00:02:00,538
I mean, now that I'm back, I just...

27
00:02:00,672 --> 00:02:02,986
wanted to make sure
that you were doing okay.

28
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:05,220
Thank you.

29
00:02:06,033 --> 00:02:07,033
I'm okay.

30
00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:08,970
Great.

31
00:04:38,137 --> 00:04:39,791
- Who is she?
- I have no idea.

32
00:04:40,032 --> 00:04:42,612
She seems to know you, dude.
She just said your name.

33
00:04:43,043 --> 00:04:44,974
I've never seen her before in my life.

34
00:04:47,179 --> 00:04:48,221
She's waking up.

35
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:53,946
She's trying to talk.
We should get her some water.

36
00:04:55,031 --> 00:04:56,142
Hey, give me a hand.

37
00:05:01,393 --> 00:05:03,154
- What's she saying?
- I don't know.

38
00:05:04,288 --> 00:05:07,174
- Spanish, dude.
- What, do you understand her, then?

39
00:05:11,534 --> 00:05:12,700
She says she's dying.

40
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,135
My God!

41
00:05:20,237 --> 00:05:22,707
It's a branch!
She must have hit it on the way down.

42
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:26,038
Get her pack. We haven't got much
in this first aid kit.

43
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:27,832
See if there's anything
we can use in it.

44
00:05:27,934 --> 00:05:30,469
What if this is a rescue?
What if she came for us?

45
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:31,694
Is she gonna be okay?

46
00:05:31,826 --> 00:05:34,123
- We can't let her...
- Just go and start looking!

47
00:05:37,729 --> 00:05:38,847
We get Jack.

48
00:05:39,050 --> 00:05:41,000
We have to get her to Jack
as soon as possible.

49
00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:44,044
- She could be our way off the island.
- If we move her, it'll be worse.

50
00:05:44,146 --> 00:05:45,423
We just let her bleed to death?

51
00:05:45,782 --> 00:05:47,245
No, we need to bring Jack here.

52
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:48,762
It's an 8-hour walk one way!

53
00:05:49,732 --> 00:05:50,803
Then I'll run.

54
00:05:51,456 --> 00:05:53,416
You're out of your mind. It's not safe.

55
00:05:53,573 --> 00:05:56,002
It's gonna be dark soon.
Who knows who's out in this jungle?

56
00:05:56,104 --> 00:05:58,440
In case you have forgotten,
there're people on this island

57
00:05:58,553 --> 00:06:00,511
- trying to kill us!
- Nobody knows we're here!

58

59
00:08:07,874 --> 00:08:08,908
How's this?

60
00:08:09,669 --> 00:08:10,787
That's perfect.

61
00:08:11,477 --> 00:08:12,477
Thank you.

62
00:08:19,547 --> 00:08:21,229
What do you think happened to Jack

63
00:08:21,411 --> 00:08:22,852
while he was with the others?

64
00:08:24,411 --> 00:08:27,265
Since he's been back,
he seems different.

65
00:08:29,412 --> 00:08:31,965
He says that he was pretty much
a prisoner,

66
00:08:32,317 --> 00:08:34,329
and the only reason
why he cooperated is 'cause

67
00:08:34,528 --> 00:08:36,434
he thought
they'd let him off the island.

68
00:08:37,774 --> 00:08:38,904
Do you believe him?

69
00:08:41,602 --> 00:08:42,602
Why wouldn't I?

70
00:08:44,850 --> 00:08:47,863
He came to me,
asking about my pregnancy.

71
00:08:49,037 --> 00:08:51,371
- What would that have anything to do...
- What if...

72
00:08:52,475 --> 00:08:54,255
What if the others want my baby?

73
00:08:55,476 --> 00:08:57,476
He's been there alone for over a week.

74
00:08:57,977 --> 00:09:00,310
How do we know
he isn't working with them?

75
00:09:04,915 --> 00:09:06,415
He's not working with them.

76
00:09:09,287 --> 00:09:10,842
Do you know something, Kate?

77
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:21,474
It's Juliet.

78
00:09:22,476 --> 00:09:25,435
She was their doctor... their...
Their fertility doctor,

79
00:09:25,537 --> 00:09:26,870
studying pregnant women,

80
00:09:27,335 --> 00:09:29,696
and when Claire was sick,
she told me and Jack...

81
00:09:31,161 --> 00:09:33,383
The reason the Others
wanted her baby...

82
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:35,191
was for research.

83
00:09:44,035 --> 00:09:46,176
- Wait. You don't have to do this.
- Go away, Kate.

84
00:09:49,227 --> 00:09:51,171
I want to know about your research.

85
00:09:53,287 --> 00:09:55,009
What happens to pregnant women?

86
00:09:56,913 --> 00:09:58,038
You're pregnant.

87
00:09:59,411 --> 00:10:01,077
Are you sure? How do you know?

88
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:02,937
I asked you a question.

89
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:04,734
Everyone else might be all right

90
00:10:04,836 --> 00:10:07,230
with you washing your clothes
and eating our food,

91
00:10:07,415 --> 00:10:09,359
but I want to know what's going on.

92
00:10:09,789 --> 00:10:10,925
I want answers.

93
00:10:12,913 --> 00:10:15,968
What are you people doing?
Why are you taking children?

94
00:10:18,537 --> 00:10:21,148
What happens to pregnant women
on this island?

95
00:10:23,017 --> 00:10:24,552
- What happens... - They die.

96
00:10:27,286 --> 00:10:28,286
They all die.

97
00:10:32,099 --> 00:10:33,376
Sun, come on. Let's go.

98
00:10:44,372 --> 00:10:45,474
What is she saying?

99
00:10:45,576 --> 00:10:47,706
Chinese... not Korean.

100
00:10:47,865 --> 00:10:49,292
Maybe we should just pull it out.

101
00:10:49,572 --> 00:10:51,900
- You'll just make it worse.
- You forgot what's at stake?

102
00:10:52,032 --> 00:10:53,422
Or is this another of your flashes?

103
00:10:53,524 --> 00:10:54,901
Who's getting an arrow in the neck?

104
00:10:55,032 --> 00:10:57,277
Unless you forget,
she said my bloody name!

105
00:10:59,397 --> 00:11:01,688
She had a photo of me
and my girlfriend!

106
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:04,878
Do I understand?
I understand better than all of you!

107
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:06,965
Hey, guys, chill.

108
00:11:07,067 --> 00:11:08,999
We've wasted enough time already.

109
00:11:09,854 --> 00:11:11,195
Hey, you're not leaving us.

110
00:11:11,430 --> 00:11:13,033
Just get out of my way, Charlie.

111
00:12:34,327 --> 00:12:35,327
Who are you?

112
00:12:37,268 --> 00:12:38,738
I said, who are you?

113
00:12:41,328 --> 00:12:42,983
He's the guy who shot Sayid.

114
00:12:43,755 --> 00:12:46,493
Kate told us he lived out
in that station that Locke blew up.

115
00:12:47,515 --> 00:12:48,538
He's an Other.

116
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:51,430
I thought Locke killed that guy
with the electro-fence thingy.

117
00:12:52,765 --> 00:12:56,152
You've got five seconds to talk,
or I fire this gun, brother.

118
00:12:58,604 --> 00:12:59,661
That's a flare gun.

119
00:12:59,763 --> 00:13:01,513
And how do you think it'll feel...

120
00:13:01,829 --> 00:13:04,375
Taking a flare to the chest
at this range?

121
00:13:06,095 --> 00:13:09,047
As your friend pointed out,
I already died once this week.

122
00:13:17,184 --> 00:13:18,342
You understand her.

123
00:13:18,558 --> 00:13:19,835
She's speaking Italian.

124
00:13:20,372 --> 00:13:22,427
She said she's dying. She needs help.

125
00:13:24,872 --> 00:13:28,111
I was a soviet army field medic.
I can offer you my services.

126
00:13:29,808 --> 00:13:31,889
- Wait. What are you doing?
- I'm saving her.

127
00:13:40,667 --> 00:13:42,576
This branch has punctured her lung.

128
00:13:42,998 --> 00:13:44,331
It's filling with blood.

129
00:13:44,559 --> 00:13:47,068
If it is not ventilated soon,
she's going to die.

130
00:13:51,113 --> 00:13:53,068
Well, do it. Help her.

131
00:13:53,183 --> 00:13:54,183
If I fix her,

132
00:13:54,808 --> 00:13:57,444
you must let me walk away
as if I never came upon you.

133
00:14:06,373 --> 00:14:07,373
What do you need?

134
00:17:59,601 --> 00:18:02,192
Be quiet. Don't move.

135
00:18:03,771 --> 00:18:06,818
You want me to help you and your baby?
I have answers to your questions,

136
00:18:06,961 --> 00:18:08,989
but you have to come with me right now.

137
00:18:09,372 --> 00:18:11,404
Just you and me, nobody else.

138
00:18:19,184 --> 00:18:22,325
If what you said was true,
that means I'm already dead.

139
00:18:23,306 --> 00:18:24,890
Why should I go anywhere with you?

140
00:18:25,026 --> 00:18:27,108
Because there may be hope for you yet.

141
00:18:52,855 --> 00:18:53,910
Where are we going?

142
00:18:54,809 --> 00:18:58,013
There's a medical station near here.
They have an ultrasound machine.

143
00:18:58,485 --> 00:19:00,762
Claire and Kate
told me about that place.

144
00:19:02,048 --> 00:19:03,048
It was abandoned.

145
00:19:03,495 --> 00:19:04,597
They found nothing there.

146
00:19:04,727 --> 00:19:07,210
Well, that's because
they didn't know where to look.

147
00:19:08,111 --> 00:19:09,833
What are you going to do to me?

148
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:16,428
I'm gonna look at your baby
and determine the D.O.C....

149
00:19:17,688 --> 00:19:19,018
Date of conception.

150
00:19:19,239 --> 00:19:21,260
The ultrasound will tell me
when you got pregnant,

151
00:19:21,379 --> 00:19:22,416
give or take a day.

152
00:19:22,566 --> 00:19:23,975
If you got pregnant off the island,

153
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,922
then you and your baby
will probably be okay,

154
00:19:27,988 --> 00:19:29,710
but if you got pregnant here...

155
00:19:33,286 --> 00:19:35,810
We'll cross that bridge
when we come to it.

156
00:19:36,738 --> 00:19:39,626
When was the last time
you and your husband had sex?

157
00:19:39,883 --> 00:19:41,386
I would rather not talk about that.

158
00:19:41,487 --> 00:19:43,197
Look, I know that it's personal,

159
00:19:43,288 --> 00:19:44,897
but if I know when,
then I can figure...

160
00:19:44,991 --> 00:19:46,980
Isn't that what the machine will do?

161
00:19:50,050 --> 00:19:51,383
Then let's keep walking.

162
00:22:56,973 --> 00:22:58,607
What else do you know
about this woman?

163
00:22:58,795 --> 00:23:00,964
Did she have anything on her
besides the flare gun?

164
00:23:01,113 --> 00:23:03,969
Just a book,
a fancy radio/phone thingy...

165
00:23:06,612 --> 00:23:07,612
Does it work?

166
00:23:09,422 --> 00:23:10,422
Like I'd tell you.

167
00:23:11,922 --> 00:23:13,088
One of you must help.

168
00:23:13,486 --> 00:23:15,597
The rest, clear the way.
I need space.

169
00:23:16,122 --> 00:23:17,236
I'll do it.

170
00:23:20,110 --> 00:23:22,219
Wipe away as much of the blood
as you can.

171
00:23:22,773 --> 00:23:24,580
We need to evacuate the air now!

172
00:23:26,048 --> 00:23:27,048
Hold her steady.

173
00:23:28,049 --> 00:23:29,846
- Steady!
- I heard you.

174
00:23:35,321 --> 00:23:37,003
Is that... normal?

175
00:23:44,641 --> 00:23:45,743
Gauze.

176
00:23:49,098 --> 00:23:51,121
Tape it. Be careful.

177
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:53,415
The covering needs to be hollow.

178
00:23:54,148 --> 00:23:55,648
The wound needs to breathe.

179
00:24:03,635 --> 00:24:04,771
What did she say?

180
00:24:05,834 --> 00:24:06,834
"Thank you."

181
00:24:08,211 --> 00:24:10,022
She said,
"thank you for helping me."

182
00:24:21,837 --> 00:24:23,076
It's right down here.

183
00:25:21,146 --> 00:25:22,423
Why are you doing this?

184
00:25:23,712 --> 00:25:24,712
What?

185
00:25:25,835 --> 00:25:26,835
Helping me.

186
00:25:37,459 --> 00:25:38,539
Once upon a time,

187
00:25:40,065 --> 00:25:42,746
I told women that they were pregnant,

188
00:25:43,772 --> 00:25:45,136
and their faces...

189
00:25:47,516 --> 00:25:48,959
it was the best news

190
00:25:49,648 --> 00:25:52,063
they ever got
in their entire life.

191
00:25:54,397 --> 00:25:55,692
Then I came here.

192
00:25:59,399 --> 00:26:00,399
I've lost...

193
00:26:02,648 --> 00:26:06,545
nine patients in the last three years.

194
00:26:10,713 --> 00:26:13,046
I'm helping you
because I want to tell you

195
00:26:13,396 --> 00:26:16,729
that you and your husband got
pregnant before you came here.

196
00:26:21,712 --> 00:26:24,767
I'm helping you because
I want to give good news again.

197
00:26:31,586 --> 00:26:33,086
I slept with another man...

198
00:26:38,014 --> 00:26:39,701
...before we got to the island.

199
00:26:43,896 --> 00:26:45,451
Jin and I, we were having...

200
00:26:48,523 --> 00:26:49,523
trouble.

201
00:26:49,712 --> 00:26:50,712
We weren't...

202
00:26:56,146 --> 00:26:57,201
and I had a friend.

203
00:27:06,712 --> 00:27:07,712
It was a mistake.

204
00:27:08,708 --> 00:27:10,041
We all make mistakes.

205
00:27:15,742 --> 00:27:16,833
Which way?

206
00:27:51,683 --> 00:27:53,558
Will you help me move this forward?

207
00:27:58,620 --> 00:27:59,688
Good.

208
00:28:27,517 --> 00:28:28,903
Why is this room hidden?

209
00:28:31,946 --> 00:28:33,188
Don't worry about it.

210
00:28:33,896 --> 00:28:34,951
What is this place?

211
00:28:37,767 --> 00:28:38,835
Tell me!

212
00:28:41,836 --> 00:28:43,908
It's where we brought
the women to die.

213
00:28:51,156 --> 00:28:52,156
She's fine.

214
00:28:52,919 --> 00:28:54,727
Keep the wound as clean as you can.

215
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:57,687
She should be better in a day.

216
00:28:58,450 --> 00:29:00,757
A day?
Her lung was punctured.

217
00:29:02,573 --> 00:29:05,128
On this island,
the rules are a bit different.

218
00:29:05,887 --> 00:29:07,164
Maybe a day and a half.

219
00:29:12,763 --> 00:29:13,874
I did as I promised.

220
00:29:15,136 --> 00:29:16,136
She will live.

221
00:29:17,138 --> 00:29:19,699
- You can't seriously considering...
- Just go.

222
00:29:22,063 --> 00:29:23,468
Are you kidding?
He's one of them!

223
00:29:23,513 --> 00:29:25,044
So what would you
have me do, Charlie?

224
00:29:25,053 --> 00:29:26,837
We've got to make a stretcher
and carry her.

225
00:29:26,856 --> 00:29:28,734
How are we gonna do that
and bring a prisoner?

226
00:29:28,852 --> 00:29:30,695
Give me some rope.
I'll take responsibility.

227
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:32,742
Phone. Phone!

228
00:29:33,798 --> 00:29:35,012
Wait, Jin!

229
00:29:35,263 --> 00:29:36,784
- Jin, it's all right!
- No, let him!

230
00:29:37,141 --> 00:29:38,471
- Come back here!
- Let him!

231
00:29:40,932 --> 00:29:42,462
Jin, it's all right! Jin!

232
00:29:43,152 --> 00:29:44,851
Let him go.
Jin, let him go!

233
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:47,152
Phone!

234
00:29:55,074 --> 00:29:56,074
You stole this?

235
00:29:56,177 --> 00:29:58,325
How could you respect me
if I didn't try?

236
00:29:58,447 --> 00:30:01,558
How about I take your other eye?
Would you respect that?

237
00:30:02,082 --> 00:30:03,604
Sorry. I...

238
00:30:04,396 --> 00:30:05,405
Charlie, don't!

239
00:30:05,533 --> 00:30:07,320
Charlie, let him go!

240
00:30:07,436 --> 00:30:10,189
This is a mistake!
We can't keep letting these people go!

241
00:30:10,310 --> 00:30:11,509
We gave him our word!

242
00:30:22,093 --> 00:30:24,754
Go on.
Get out of here.

243
00:30:47,829 --> 00:30:49,193
The baby isn't Jin's.

244
00:30:53,735 --> 00:30:56,568
We tried to have a baby
back in Korea and couldn't.

245
00:30:57,300 --> 00:30:58,300
And the doctor...

246
00:31:02,236 --> 00:31:03,847
he told me Jin was infertile.

247
00:31:04,985 --> 00:31:06,262
And then you came here.

248
00:31:07,859 --> 00:31:08,859
What?

249
00:31:09,737 --> 00:31:13,066
Did you know that
the average male sperm count

250
00:31:13,198 --> 00:31:16,456
is between 60 and 80 million?

251
00:31:18,390 --> 00:31:19,414
But on this island,

252
00:31:20,390 --> 00:31:21,648
it's five times that.

253
00:31:22,422 --> 00:31:23,699
We call that good odds.

254
00:31:26,983 --> 00:31:27,983
You ready?

255
00:31:30,214 --> 00:31:31,356
Yes.

256
00:31:31,548 --> 00:31:33,429
You wanna lift up your shirt a little?

257
00:31:34,966 --> 00:31:36,046
It's cold.

258
00:31:39,545 --> 00:31:40,656
Will I see the baby?

259
00:31:41,110 --> 00:31:44,589
Maybe. It's your first trimester,
so it's a little iffy.

260
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:48,687
If you don't see a heartbeat,
don't worry about it.

261
00:31:48,861 --> 00:31:49,906
It's just early.

262
00:31:52,611 --> 00:31:53,611
How does it work?

263
00:31:54,508 --> 00:31:56,944
Well, I take a measurement of the fetus,

264
00:31:57,045 --> 00:31:58,211
and that will tell us

265
00:31:58,420 --> 00:32:00,031
when your baby was conceived,

266
00:32:02,110 --> 00:32:03,443
and then we'll know who.

267
00:32:08,168 --> 00:32:09,270
Are you okay?

268
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:13,121
I lose either way.

269
00:32:15,523 --> 00:32:16,796
If I'm going to live...

270
00:32:18,670 --> 00:32:20,819
that means the baby's not Jin's.

271
00:32:22,771 --> 00:32:24,351
Do you still want to do this?

272
00:32:27,045 --> 00:32:28,045
Yes.

273
00:32:31,608 --> 00:32:32,608
Moment of truth.

274
00:35:18,254 --> 00:35:19,322
There it is.

275
00:35:20,444 --> 00:35:21,444
There's your baby.

276
00:35:21,725 --> 00:35:22,827
Can you see?

277
00:35:27,843 --> 00:35:28,900
I can see it.

278
00:35:32,415 --> 00:35:33,495
Is it a boy or a girl?

279
00:35:33,597 --> 00:35:35,529
It's... it's a little early,

280
00:35:36,203 --> 00:35:37,301
but...

281
00:35:38,317 --> 00:35:39,714
do you see that little flutter?

282
00:35:42,295 --> 00:35:43,806
That's the heart beating.

283
00:35:49,104 --> 00:35:51,309
It's very strong. It's very healthy.

284
00:35:59,105 --> 00:36:01,776
You crashed here 90 days ago.

285
00:36:03,716 --> 00:36:06,489
The baby was conceived
about eight weeks ago,

286
00:36:07,245 --> 00:36:09,393
so... around 53 days.

287
00:36:14,131 --> 00:36:15,853
You got pregnant on the island.

288
00:36:20,471 --> 00:36:23,176
I am sorry. I'm so sorry, Sun.

289
00:36:24,329 --> 00:36:26,090
I will do everything that I can.

290
00:36:37,768 --> 00:36:38,922
It's Jin's.

291
00:38:14,698 --> 00:38:15,991
So how long do I have?

292
00:38:18,861 --> 00:38:21,865
Most of the women made it into
the middle of their second trimester.

293
00:38:25,667 --> 00:38:27,375
Nobody made it to their third.

294
00:38:30,124 --> 00:38:32,010
That gives me two months.

295
00:38:36,424 --> 00:38:37,458
I am...

296
00:38:41,808 --> 00:38:43,450
very happy the baby's Jin's.

297
00:38:45,497 --> 00:38:47,270
You gave me good news, Juliet.

298
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:51,050
It was my pleasure, Sun.

299
00:38:54,233 --> 00:38:57,335
I'm gonna go back inside and make sure
that I didn't miss anything.

300
00:38:57,906 --> 00:39:01,020
I don't wanna take the chance
that we didn't cover our tracks.

301
00:39:05,031 --> 00:39:06,531
Do you wanna wait out here?

302
00:39:08,031 --> 00:39:09,031
All right.

303
00:39:17,594 --> 00:39:18,594
Thank you.

304
00:39:53,969 --> 00:39:56,191
Ben, it's 6:00 a.m. on Saturday morning.

305
00:39:58,967 --> 00:39:59,967
Kwon is pregnant.

306
00:40:00,095 --> 00:40:02,680
The fetus is healthy
and was conceived on island

307
00:40:02,782 --> 00:40:03,782
with her husband.

308
00:40:03,970 --> 00:40:05,970
He was sterile before they got here.

309
00:40:06,326 --> 00:40:08,794
I'm still working on getting
samples from the other women.

310
00:40:08,909 --> 00:40:10,593
I should have Austen's soon.

311
00:40:10,906 --> 00:40:12,794
I'll report back when I know more.

312
00:40:20,155 --> 00:40:21,155
I hate you.

313
00:40:29,398 --> 00:40:30,891
You can't trust 'em, you know.

314
00:40:31,676 --> 00:40:33,359
- What's that?
- The others...

315
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:35,063
The one you let go.

316
00:40:35,754 --> 00:40:38,055
He'll be back tomorrow
with five of his mates.

317
00:40:38,295 --> 00:40:39,571
Should've killed him.

318
00:40:40,458 --> 00:40:41,553
Charlie.

319
00:40:41,655 --> 00:40:43,653
- Tight.
- Okay.

320
00:40:44,376 --> 00:40:45,467
You know, brother,

321
00:40:46,404 --> 00:40:47,404
by my count,

322
00:40:49,466 --> 00:40:51,843
you've killed more of them
than they've killed of you.

323
00:40:52,110 --> 00:40:53,143
They started it.

324
00:40:53,715 --> 00:40:56,035
Just 'cause one comes
traipsing back with Jack and Kate

325
00:40:56,137 --> 00:40:58,393
doesn't mean that we can
trust them now.

326
00:41:18,852 --> 00:41:19,867
Mom?

327
00:41:24,149 --> 00:41:25,262
Where am I?

328
00:41:26,740 --> 00:41:28,478
Take it easy.
You had a giant branch...

329
00:41:28,580 --> 00:41:30,177
- Where am I?
- I don't know.

330
00:41:31,219 --> 00:41:32,472
You're on an island.

331
00:41:33,402 --> 00:41:34,660
Are you here to rescue us?

332
00:41:34,968 --> 00:41:37,342
Are there more of you?
can you make your phone work?

333
00:41:37,699 --> 00:41:38,741
Who are you?

334
00:41:38,843 --> 00:41:41,904
Hugo Reyes.
I crashed here on Oceanic flight 815.

335
00:41:42,469 --> 00:41:43,615
A bunch of us survived.

336
00:41:43,717 --> 00:41:46,092
Is that why you're here?
Were you looking for us?

337
00:41:47,225 --> 00:41:48,345
815?

338
00:41:49,971 --> 00:41:52,690
Flight 815? The one from Sydney?

339
00:41:54,822 --> 00:41:56,994
No. That's not possible.

340
00:41:57,096 --> 00:41:59,830
Yeah, I know. It wasn't easy,
but we found food...

341
00:42:00,165 --> 00:42:02,274
- in the hatch...
- No, flight 815, they...

342
00:42:03,532 --> 00:42:04,837
They found the plane.

343
00:42:07,468 --> 00:42:08,801
There were no survivors.

344
00:42:12,838 --> 00:42:13,927
They were all dead.

345
00:42:19,092 --> 00:42:20,092
What?
