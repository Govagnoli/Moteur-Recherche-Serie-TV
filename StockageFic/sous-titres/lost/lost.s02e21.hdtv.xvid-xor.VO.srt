1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:01,856
Previously on "Lost"...

2
00:00:04,014 --> 00:00:07,116
My leg! Aah!

3
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:10,549
I need you to go up through
the grate and into the vents.

4
00:00:10,644 --> 00:00:14,035
- That button has to be pushed.
- Okay.

5
00:00:22,012 --> 00:00:25,786
I crawled through your vents,
and I stood at your computer,

6
00:00:25,879 --> 00:00:27,642
and you know what happened?

7
00:00:27,736 --> 00:00:29,258
Nothing happened, John.

8
00:00:29,350 --> 00:00:33,555
I never entered the numbers,
I never pressed the button.

9
00:00:35,458 --> 00:00:37,986
If you want to do
something nice for Libby,

10
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:41,469
there's a beautiful beach
3 kilometers from here.

11
00:00:41,612 --> 00:00:43,270
You could take her there.

12
00:00:43,462 --> 00:00:44,988
Come on, give me the blankets.

13
00:00:45,078 --> 00:00:46,149
Blankets?

14
00:00:46,339 --> 00:00:49,248
I will handle the
blankets, okay?

15
00:00:49,716 --> 00:00:52,052
Take us to the guns. Now.

16
00:00:52,286 --> 00:00:56,395
Ah, that bitch.
Stole my damn gun. Ana Lucia.

17
00:00:57,004 --> 00:00:58,574
Why would she need a gun?

18
00:00:58,712 --> 00:01:02,947
We caught one of them-- the others.
He's locked up in there.

19
00:01:03,085 --> 00:01:05,853
Give me the gun. I'll kill him.

20
00:01:06,041 --> 00:01:07,323
I'm sorry.

21
00:01:11,646 --> 00:01:12,680
Michael?

22
00:01:31,204 --> 00:01:32,438
What are you building?

23
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:40,610
Hello, Ana.

24
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:44,708
Well, hello, yourself.
So are you gonna tell me?

25
00:01:45,175 --> 00:01:48,307
- What is it?
- I'm building a church.

26
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:51,961
Now why the hell would
you want to do that?

27
00:01:52,148 --> 00:01:54,102
Because I was told to.

28
00:01:54,241 --> 00:01:56,099
Told to by who?

29
00:01:56,286 --> 00:01:59,533
I was just told.
I think it was in a dream.

30
00:01:59,764 --> 00:02:02,579
A dream like this one?

31
00:02:11,534 --> 00:02:13,822
You need to help John.

32
00:02:33,649 --> 00:02:34,691
Yemi?

33
00:02:39,239 --> 00:02:42,100
- Hello, brother.
- Oh, Yemi.

34
00:02:43,226 --> 00:02:46,376
Forgive me. I should have
listened to you. You were right.

35
00:02:46,515 --> 00:02:49,235
- I did not mean to do it--
- Shh, shh, shh.

36
00:02:49,609 --> 00:02:53,190
The work being done in this
place is important, Eko.

37
00:02:53,377 --> 00:02:57,821
It is more important than anything,
and it is in danger.

38
00:02:59,789 --> 00:03:01,981
You must help John.

39
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:04,689
He has lost his way.

40
00:03:04,927 --> 00:03:08,168
You must make him take
you to the question mark.

41
00:03:20,359 --> 00:03:24,850
John will not want to show you,
so you must make him.

42
00:03:25,928 --> 00:03:30,180
Eko... There are many
distractions, brother.

43
00:03:30,273 --> 00:03:34,524
But you must move past them.
What is done, is done.

44
00:03:34,851 --> 00:03:38,127
- Do you understand?
- Yes, yemi.

45
00:03:41,878 --> 00:03:43,496
And, Eko...

46
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:45,147
bring the ax.

47
00:03:53,896 --> 00:03:55,084
What's the matter?

48
00:04:05,492 --> 00:04:06,492
You all right, mate?

49
00:04:15,068 --> 00:04:17,070
I need to find John.

50
00:04:21,054 --> 00:04:23,404
- What were you thinking, John?
- Jack, leave him alone.

51
00:04:23,434 --> 00:04:25,034
No, Jack,
don't leave him alone.

52
00:04:25,187 --> 00:04:27,205
Shut it, Sawyer.
If Ana hadn't lifted your gun--

53
00:04:27,235 --> 00:04:29,867
Oh, ain't that swell--
gimpy McCrutch over here covers up that

54
00:04:29,897 --> 00:04:33,443
the artist formerly known as Henry Gale
tried to strangle your little amiga,

55
00:04:33,473 --> 00:04:35,906
and suddenly it's on me
when she goes vigilante.

56
00:04:36,091 --> 00:04:37,768
How about you go
back to the beach?

57
00:04:37,798 --> 00:04:39,512
Hey, enough, both of you.

58
00:04:42,558 --> 00:04:44,080
Michael, hey!

59
00:04:46,432 --> 00:04:47,706
He shot me.

60
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:49,796
- Who?
- He's gone! He ran out.

61
00:04:49,937 --> 00:04:50,741
Go, I got him.

62
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:54,746
Jack... I was sleeping,
and I heard gunshots.

63
00:04:54,886 --> 00:04:57,320
I got up.
I came out of the bedroom.

64
00:04:57,926 --> 00:05:01,124
And this-- there was this guy--
he had a gun, and...

65
00:05:04,453 --> 00:05:07,268
Come on.
We've got to get you up, all right?

66
00:05:07,407 --> 00:05:08,545
Let me help you.

67
00:05:49,602 --> 00:05:50,740
She's dead.

68
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,688
Okay, we've got to get her up.

69
00:06:07,828 --> 00:06:10,228
We've got to get her out
to the back room, okay?

70
00:06:46,544 --> 00:06:49,123
Grant us this mercy, O Lord,

71
00:06:49,634 --> 00:06:52,305
we beseech thee. Amen.

72
00:07:07,605 --> 00:07:09,176
She's in shock.

73
00:07:09,456 --> 00:07:11,457
We've got to keep
pressure on this.

74
00:07:12,534 --> 00:07:14,200
Can you do anything?

75
00:07:15,372 --> 00:07:17,230
- Jack--
- I heard you.

76
00:07:17,555 --> 00:07:19,652
Just keep pressure
on her, okay?

77
00:07:25,606 --> 00:07:29,838
- How is she?
- I'm doing what I can.

78
00:07:30,775 --> 00:07:32,250
How long ago?

79
00:07:33,179 --> 00:07:33,979
What?

80
00:07:34,113 --> 00:07:36,513
When did this happen?
How long ago did he leave?

81
00:07:36,584 --> 00:07:40,790
I don't know, uh...
20 minutes, maybe a half-hour ago.

82
00:07:42,433 --> 00:07:45,290
We can pick up the trail,
catch up to him.

83
00:07:45,476 --> 00:07:47,827
Man's got a head start, a gun,
he ain't afraid of using--

84
00:07:47,857 --> 00:07:50,527
He shot three of our people.
One of them's dead--

85
00:07:50,621 --> 00:07:54,071
Who's gonna take care of Libby while
you're off playing Daniel Boone?

86
00:07:56,488 --> 00:07:57,580
I will go.

87
00:07:59,931 --> 00:08:02,791
John, you have tracking
experience, yes?

88
00:08:02,927 --> 00:08:03,732
Yeah.

89
00:08:05,284 --> 00:08:07,409
We will find his
trail together.

90
00:08:07,596 --> 00:08:10,188
If  you find anything--
anything, you come right back here,

91
00:08:10,218 --> 00:08:12,946
and we figure out what we're
gonna do next together.

92
00:08:20,722 --> 00:08:21,957
Let's go, John.

93
00:08:28,003 --> 00:08:30,684
How long has it been since
your last confession?

94
00:08:30,815 --> 00:08:34,157
Good question.
Too many years for me to even remember.

95
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:36,730
What do you wish to ask
God's forgiveness for?

96
00:08:36,873 --> 00:08:38,343
What sins have you committed?

97
00:08:38,529 --> 00:08:42,493
Let's see. Well, I slept with
another woman besides my wife.

98
00:08:42,868 --> 00:08:44,921
Just once, or many times?

99
00:08:45,056 --> 00:08:46,771
How many is many?

100
00:08:47,143 --> 00:08:51,020
To receive god's forgiveness,
you must be penitent for your sins.

101
00:08:51,154 --> 00:08:56,697
I also forged I.D. papers for a
guy pretending to be a priest.

102
00:08:59,368 --> 00:09:00,761
Do you have it?

103
00:09:07,265 --> 00:09:08,835
So what'd you do, padre?

104
00:09:09,022 --> 00:09:10,639
Skim from the collection plate?

105
00:09:13,785 --> 00:09:16,085
You know I've got some
friends in Los Angeles.

106
00:09:16,301 --> 00:09:18,302
I could get you on with them.

107
00:09:18,724 --> 00:09:22,640
- Doing what?
- You know... stuff.

108
00:09:24,849 --> 00:09:26,513
Good morning, father Tunde.

109
00:09:26,695 --> 00:09:29,462
Good morning, monsignor.
This is Mr. Caldwell.

110
00:09:29,649 --> 00:09:32,846
He has been helping me arrange
my trip to the United States.

111
00:09:32,987 --> 00:09:35,058
I'm sorry, father,
but I've got some bad news.

112
00:09:35,088 --> 00:09:37,238
You're going to have
to postpone your trip.

113
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:39,833
It appears we have a miracle.

114
00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:45,859
My daughter, she...
she drowned.

115
00:09:46,132 --> 00:09:48,085
I'm very sorry for your loss.

116
00:09:48,189 --> 00:09:52,148
Oh, no, you don't understand.
She came back to life.

117
00:09:53,454 --> 00:09:56,988
We were out in the back blocks,
and Charlotte must have slipped,

118
00:09:57,086 --> 00:10:01,196
and she went into the river, and...
she's not much of a swimmer.

119
00:10:02,562 --> 00:10:07,621
She was dead.
And the next day, she woke up.

120
00:10:08,658 --> 00:10:12,273
Don't  you understand?
It's a miracle.

121
00:10:12,366 --> 00:10:14,455
A confirmation of faith.

122
00:10:14,585 --> 00:10:16,536
Everyone needs to know about this.
People need--

123
00:10:16,566 --> 00:10:19,622
- Where is your daughter now?
- At home, with my husband.

124
00:10:19,761 --> 00:10:21,722
And what does he think?

125
00:10:22,042 --> 00:10:24,201
The world needs to
know about this.

126
00:10:24,332 --> 00:10:26,879
We need to tell the Vatican,
we need to tell the world--

127
00:10:26,909 --> 00:10:29,152
I'm sorry, we can't just do that,
Mrs. Malkin.

128
00:10:29,182 --> 00:10:33,444
The church needs to conduct an
investigation before anyone can be told.

129
00:10:33,584 --> 00:10:37,635
Father Tunde will start this process,
if you will permit him.

130
00:10:40,588 --> 00:10:43,834
Mrs. Malkin, would you excuse
us for a moment, please?

131
00:10:43,927 --> 00:10:44,827
Of course.

132
00:10:49,373 --> 00:10:54,776
Monsignor, with all due respect,
I cannot do what you have asked.

133
00:10:54,916 --> 00:10:55,959
Why not?

134
00:10:56,153 --> 00:10:59,248
Because I do not believe
what this woman says.

135
00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:02,148
Why do you think I chose you?

136
00:11:15,431 --> 00:11:17,574
Are you seeing
something I'm not?

137
00:11:18,595 --> 00:11:19,591
Hey!

138
00:11:25,357 --> 00:11:27,597
I haven't seen a
single track or

139
00:11:27,737 --> 00:11:30,221
a piece of sign since
we left the hatch.

140
00:11:30,404 --> 00:11:32,022
What the hell are
you following?

141
00:11:32,397 --> 00:11:34,302
Where is the question mark?

142
00:11:34,441 --> 00:11:35,628
The what?

143
00:11:39,007 --> 00:11:43,479
The question mark, John.
Where is it?

144
00:11:45,212 --> 00:11:46,880
You know what?

145
00:11:47,012 --> 00:11:51,178
You keep chasing after your own shadow.
I'm going back.

146
00:11:53,288 --> 00:11:56,009
I know you do not
want to show it...

147
00:11:56,145 --> 00:11:57,209
but you must.

148
00:11:57,375 --> 00:11:59,567
No, I don't have to
show you anything.

149
00:11:59,712 --> 00:12:01,134
Then I'm sorry.

150
00:12:19,652 --> 00:12:20,748
You hit me.

151
00:12:23,632 --> 00:12:24,772
Why did you...

152
00:12:24,912 --> 00:12:27,252
Because you were
being difficult.

153
00:12:28,842 --> 00:12:30,556
Are you insane?

154
00:12:31,070 --> 00:12:31,970
No.

155
00:12:37,083 --> 00:12:42,110
Ana Lucia, your friend,
was just murdered, and you--

156
00:12:42,245 --> 00:12:44,246
Ana wants me to help you, John.

157
00:12:46,396 --> 00:12:49,882
- Help me do what?
- Find the question mark.

158
00:12:53,165 --> 00:12:55,707
You don't even know what
you're talking about, do you?

159
00:12:55,737 --> 00:12:56,444
No.

160
00:13:01,254 --> 00:13:04,309
But you know what I am
talking about, John.

161
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:06,608
And that is all that matters.

162
00:13:07,498 --> 00:13:11,164
Here. Here,
you wanna find your damn question mark?

163
00:13:11,302 --> 00:13:12,934
Here it is--
here, this is it right here.

164
00:13:12,964 --> 00:13:15,251
Here, take it, take it,
because it's nothing.

165
00:13:15,392 --> 00:13:18,640
It's a memory.
It's ten seconds of nothing.

166
00:13:19,530 --> 00:13:22,776
- This is your hatch, yes?
- It's not my hatch.

167
00:13:24,509 --> 00:13:27,229
If the swan is
where we came from,

168
00:13:28,073 --> 00:13:29,739
then we go that way.

169
00:13:29,925 --> 00:13:31,734
We shouldn't even be out here.

170
00:13:31,925 --> 00:13:35,793
Ana Lucia would
still be alive...

171
00:13:36,353 --> 00:13:38,670
if I'd just told Jack
that Henry attacked her.

172
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:41,425
And  now she wants us
to go here, John.

173
00:13:41,566 --> 00:13:44,016
She wants us to go here,
John, together.

174
00:13:45,497 --> 00:13:47,850
She said this in my dream.

175
00:13:48,161 --> 00:13:50,641
Oh, of course, your dream.

176
00:13:51,109 --> 00:13:55,341
Tell me, John.
Haven't you ever followed a dream?

177
00:14:00,688 --> 00:14:03,406
So the vatican's really
interested in this one, eh?

178
00:14:03,598 --> 00:14:06,697
That depends upon what
I put in my report.

179
00:14:06,836 --> 00:14:10,036
Why don't you just start by telling
me what happened that night?

180
00:14:11,085 --> 00:14:13,612
Well, I got a call
out around 1:00 A.M.

181
00:14:14,251 --> 00:14:17,210
Ambrose brought
this girl in, dead.

182
00:14:17,349 --> 00:14:19,116
She'd been in the
water two hours.

183
00:14:19,252 --> 00:14:21,802
Have you had much experience
in this type of death?

184
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:24,400
Yeah, of course,
I'm an undertaker.

185
00:14:25,553 --> 00:14:28,082
Well, it's just my day job.

186
00:14:28,222 --> 00:14:30,093
I mean,
I'm perfectly qualified to be a coroner.

187
00:14:30,123 --> 00:14:32,560
I mean, I did--
I did go to medical school.

188
00:14:34,054 --> 00:14:39,025
And when did you find out
that she was not dead?

189
00:14:40,037 --> 00:14:41,702
During the autopsy.

190
00:14:43,125 --> 00:14:44,854
During the autopsy?

191
00:14:46,022 --> 00:14:48,554
It's all right.
I didn't expect you to believe me.

192
00:14:53,193 --> 00:14:55,688
I figured you'd want to
have a listen for yourself.

193
00:14:55,718 --> 00:14:59,935
Decedent is a caucasian female,
161 centimeters, 51.3 kilos.

194
00:15:00,110 --> 00:15:03,692
The body prepped and washed by the
very lovely Valerie McTavish...

195
00:15:03,837 --> 00:15:05,114
Ian...

196
00:15:05,957 --> 00:15:10,079
Commencing with the post.
This is a clear case of drowning.

197
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:13,173
I'll begin with the
thoracic-abdominal incision--

198
00:15:23,714 --> 00:15:24,695
Take it.

199
00:15:25,561 --> 00:15:27,129
No, please...

200
00:15:27,724 --> 00:15:30,150
I don't want to ever
listen to that tape again.

201
00:15:44,081 --> 00:15:47,661
- Lost already?
- Your map is inexact.

202
00:15:47,988 --> 00:15:49,079
No kidding.

203
00:15:49,416 --> 00:15:51,073
These landmarks...

204
00:15:52,102 --> 00:15:53,721
Is this a river?

205
00:15:53,955 --> 00:15:55,812
No, it's a wavy line.

206
00:15:56,328 --> 00:15:58,328
I didn't draw it,
I just transcribed it.

207
00:15:58,531 --> 00:16:00,781
I told you,
I don't even know if it is a map.

208
00:16:00,857 --> 00:16:02,129
Let's assume it is.

209
00:16:02,453 --> 00:16:04,600
- What's the ax for?
- I don't know yet.

210
00:16:34,762 --> 00:16:37,955
You were the one that
found this plane, yes?

211
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:39,087
Y eah.

212
00:16:41,056 --> 00:16:43,105
It was up there.

213
00:16:47,794 --> 00:16:52,094
- And what made it fall?
- Boone.

214
00:16:53,838 --> 00:16:55,927
Boone made it fall.

215
00:16:56,862 --> 00:16:58,651
Then he died.

216
00:16:59,937 --> 00:17:03,255
"It was a sacrifice that
the island demanded."

217
00:17:05,059 --> 00:17:06,964
Excuse me?

218
00:17:08,089 --> 00:17:09,373
Nothing.

219
00:17:10,318 --> 00:17:12,094
So, what's next?

220
00:17:12,212 --> 00:17:13,542
We make camp...

221
00:17:14,291 --> 00:17:16,077
get some sleep...

222
00:17:17,479 --> 00:17:19,989
and wait for
further instruction.

223
00:17:24,161 --> 00:17:25,682
Where the hell are they?

224
00:17:25,941 --> 00:17:27,919
Just calm down.

225
00:17:28,385 --> 00:17:31,014
Finding his trail in the
dark's not gonna be easy.

226
00:17:31,197 --> 00:17:32,479
They'll be back.

227
00:17:35,153 --> 00:17:36,272
Jack.

228
00:17:37,227 --> 00:17:39,881
She  say anything? Libby?

229
00:17:41,098 --> 00:17:42,861
She's still unconscious.

230
00:17:43,704 --> 00:17:45,421
The bleeding's stopped.

231
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:47,615
That's good, right?

232
00:17:47,841 --> 00:17:48,683
No.

233
00:17:50,136 --> 00:17:51,850
It's not good.

234
00:17:54,664 --> 00:17:59,060
- And there's nothing you--
- I can make her comfortable.

235
00:18:00,138 --> 00:18:02,392
I don't have what I need.

236
00:18:03,456 --> 00:18:06,428
Why are you looking at me? I gave
you all the damn meds two days ago--

237
00:18:06,458 --> 00:18:07,408
The heroin, Sawyer.

238
00:18:17,298 --> 00:18:19,108
Give me 20 minutes.

239
00:18:20,232 --> 00:18:21,899
Kate's gonna go with you.

240
00:18:22,114 --> 00:18:25,164
- It doesn't take two people to go--
- Kate is going with you.

241
00:18:27,538 --> 00:18:29,927
What are you talking about?
Why would he need me to go with him?

242
00:18:29,957 --> 00:18:33,923
Jacko here knows his heroin's
in my stash with the guns.

243
00:18:34,156 --> 00:18:37,882
So I can either show you where it's at,
or let poor Libby suffer.

244
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:46,129
- That pretty much it, doc?
- Yeah. That's pretty much it.

245
00:18:51,711 --> 00:18:53,280
Let's go, freckles.

246
00:19:10,163 --> 00:19:12,118
I'm curious about something.

247
00:19:12,319 --> 00:19:13,540
Yeah, what's that?

248
00:19:14,007 --> 00:19:16,201
How did Ana Lucia get your gun?

249
00:19:17,699 --> 00:19:20,852
I don't know.
She must've lifted it off me.

250
00:19:21,152 --> 00:19:24,571
She pickpocketed your gun?
How'd she do that?

251
00:19:24,710 --> 00:19:29,208
Well, if I knew how she did it, she
wouldn't be able to do it, now
would she?

252
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,555
After you.

253
00:19:35,695 --> 00:19:37,845
I thought you were
taking me to your stash.

254
00:19:37,883 --> 00:19:42,999
Do you have to make everything
so damn difficult? Just go in.

255
00:20:02,657 --> 00:20:04,993
You kept the guns here.

256
00:20:05,396 --> 00:20:07,445
All this time, right under you.

257
00:20:07,821 --> 00:20:09,834
Fooled you, didn't I?

258
00:20:17,653 --> 00:20:19,224
Hey, guys.

259
00:20:19,975 --> 00:20:21,609
You seen Libby around?

260
00:20:50,490 --> 00:20:51,256
Eko.

261
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:56,133
Yemi.

262
00:20:56,367 --> 00:20:59,400
Shh. You'll wake John.

263
00:21:02,075 --> 00:21:03,005
Come.

264
00:21:03,792 --> 00:21:04,737
Follow me.

265
00:21:13,536 --> 00:21:14,294
Yemi.

266
00:21:36,357 --> 00:21:37,280
Yemi!

267
00:21:43,165 --> 00:21:44,020
Yemi.

268
00:21:46,268 --> 00:21:47,311
Wake up, John.

269
00:21:54,908 --> 00:21:56,100
You all right, John?

270
00:21:57,716 --> 00:21:59,240
Yeah.

271
00:22:00,738 --> 00:22:01,992
Yeah, I'm fine.

272
00:22:02,488 --> 00:22:04,227
You had a dream.

273
00:22:07,343 --> 00:22:10,324
Was there a man? A priest?

274
00:22:14,242 --> 00:22:16,740
The man that you
saw was my brother.

275
00:22:18,738 --> 00:22:20,191
Your brother.

276
00:22:20,305 --> 00:22:22,498
This is why we needed
to come together.

277
00:22:22,921 --> 00:22:24,873
This is how we are
going to be led,

278
00:22:25,013 --> 00:22:26,945
and how we will know
where to go next.

279
00:22:27,101 --> 00:22:28,383
But I don't know where to go.

280
00:22:28,413 --> 00:22:30,000
Did he tell you anything?

281
00:22:30,125 --> 00:22:32,318
- No, he--
- Nothing? Anything?

282
00:22:32,466 --> 00:22:36,135
It wasn't even me. It was--
it was you. It-- it didn't...

283
00:22:37,638 --> 00:22:41,649
He... he wanted
me to follow him.

284
00:22:41,862 --> 00:22:44,076
Follow him where?

285
00:22:54,487 --> 00:22:55,723
Wait here.

286
00:22:57,862 --> 00:23:00,083
Eko, it was just a dream.

287
00:23:00,401 --> 00:23:01,985
It's not safe.

288
00:23:08,236 --> 00:23:09,015
Eko!

289
00:23:22,590 --> 00:23:26,633
Father, I'm afraid it's not a very good
time. You'll have to come back later.

290
00:23:26,730 --> 00:23:28,870
Mrs. Malkin,
I must speak to your daughter.

291
00:23:29,034 --> 00:23:30,784
Yesterday at the church,
you said--

292
00:23:30,816 --> 00:23:34,287
I know what I said. It's just, right
this minute, it's not a very good time.

293
00:23:34,317 --> 00:23:37,537
Get back in the house, Joyce.
Get her inside.

294
00:23:37,711 --> 00:23:40,591
- Richard, please--
- Inside --now.

295
00:23:48,663 --> 00:23:50,506
I know why you're here, friend,

296
00:23:50,631 --> 00:23:52,124
but you can save
yourself the trouble.

297
00:23:52,154 --> 00:23:54,040
What happened here
was not a miracle.

298
00:23:54,149 --> 00:23:56,964
The doctor that treated your
daughter feels differently.

299
00:23:57,107 --> 00:23:58,292
Treated her?

300
00:23:58,384 --> 00:24:00,098
You mean tried to cut her open.

301
00:24:00,377 --> 00:24:02,777
He's just trying to cover
up his own negligence.

302
00:24:02,827 --> 00:24:06,320
He tell you the whole story,
how she supposedly drowned?

303
00:24:06,481 --> 00:24:08,674
She fell into a mountain river.

304
00:24:08,831 --> 00:24:11,414
Her body shut down,
she went into hypothermia,

305
00:24:11,512 --> 00:24:13,178
which made her appear dead.

306
00:24:13,366 --> 00:24:16,002
Then why is your wife
so convinced otherwise?

307
00:24:16,176 --> 00:24:18,369
'Cause she's a zealot.

308
00:24:18,658 --> 00:24:22,616
All of this-- everything she's doing--
is to spite me.

309
00:24:22,896 --> 00:24:24,714
Why would she spite you?

310
00:24:24,868 --> 00:24:27,076
Because she knows I'm a fraud.

311
00:24:27,227 --> 00:24:30,742
Because I make my
living as a psychic.

312
00:24:30,954 --> 00:24:32,979
You see, that's what I do.

313
00:24:33,071 --> 00:24:36,657
I gather intelligence on people,
and I exploit it.

314
00:24:36,842 --> 00:24:41,095
Every day,
I meet people looking for a miracle--

315
00:24:41,235 --> 00:24:43,190
desperate to find one.

316
00:24:43,421 --> 00:24:46,027
But there are none to be had.

317
00:24:46,232 --> 00:24:49,253
Not in this world, anyway.

318
00:24:52,146 --> 00:24:57,292
I will report back to my monsignor
that there was no miracle here.

319
00:24:57,494 --> 00:25:01,652
Your daughter is alive.
This is all that matters.

320
00:25:31,667 --> 00:25:32,699
Eko!

321
00:25:33,895 --> 00:25:36,131
Be careful.

322
00:25:42,809 --> 00:25:43,971
Eko!

323
00:25:50,767 --> 00:25:51,554
Eko!

324
00:25:52,629 --> 00:25:53,579
I'm fine.

325
00:26:19,127 --> 00:26:23,332
Hey, Eko! What's up there?
Do you see anything?

326
00:26:23,478 --> 00:26:25,095
I don't see nothing.

327
00:26:51,668 --> 00:26:53,671
- It's salted.
- What?

328
00:26:53,763 --> 00:26:56,782
The earth has been salted
so that nothing can grow.

329
00:26:57,378 --> 00:26:59,447
Why would anyone
want to salt...

330
00:26:59,953 --> 00:27:01,176
there's nothing here.

331
00:27:01,326 --> 00:27:03,081
I believe they made a circle.

332
00:27:03,171 --> 00:27:06,716
A target, so that this place
can be seen from up above.

333
00:27:06,956 --> 00:27:08,085
They?

334
00:27:08,874 --> 00:27:10,395
What place?

335
00:27:10,817 --> 00:27:13,788
The place that this plane fell upon,
John. Come on.

336
00:27:34,122 --> 00:27:34,830
John.

337
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:40,445
Please, will you
help me with this?

338
00:28:05,392 --> 00:28:06,359
Wait.

339
00:28:22,749 --> 00:28:23,653
Eko.

340
00:28:24,866 --> 00:28:25,919
May I?

341
00:28:27,189 --> 00:28:29,519
Please. Be my guest.

342
00:29:30,878 --> 00:29:33,304
We were gonna have
our first date.

343
00:29:37,204 --> 00:29:38,574
Date?

344
00:29:39,790 --> 00:29:40,882
Yeah.

345
00:29:42,333 --> 00:29:44,335
Picnic on the beach.

346
00:29:52,585 --> 00:29:54,285
I'm glad you're okay, man.

347
00:32:56,198 --> 00:32:56,982
John.

348
00:33:19,483 --> 00:33:22,358
Hello. I'm Dr. Mark Wickmund,

349
00:33:22,439 --> 00:33:26,957
and this is the orientation film
for station 5 of Dharma Initiative.

350
00:33:27,071 --> 00:33:31,274
Station 5, or the pearl,
is a monitoring station

351
00:33:31,368 --> 00:33:35,225
where the activities of participants
in Dharma Initiative projects

352
00:33:35,489 --> 00:33:39,454
can be observed and recorded.
Not only for posterity,

353
00:33:39,533 --> 00:33:43,165
but for the ongoing refinement
of the Initiative as a whole.

354
00:33:43,252 --> 00:33:45,509
As Karen Degroot
herself has written,

355
00:33:45,579 --> 00:33:50,934
"careful observation is the only
key to true and complete awareness."

356
00:33:51,027 --> 00:33:53,697
Your tour of duty in the
pearl will last three weeks.

357
00:33:53,868 --> 00:33:55,669
And during this time,
you and your partner

358
00:33:55,699 --> 00:33:59,260
will observe a psychological
experiment in progress.

359
00:33:59,332 --> 00:34:03,507
Your duty is to observe team members
in another station on the island.

360
00:34:03,596 --> 00:34:06,493
These team members are not aware
that they are under surveillance,

361
00:34:06,523 --> 00:34:09,133
or that they are the
subjects of an experiment.

362
00:34:09,249 --> 00:34:12,075
Working in 8-hour shifts,
you and your partner

363
00:34:12,234 --> 00:34:18,470
will record everything you observe
in the notebooks we've provided.

364
00:34:18,934 --> 00:34:21,609
What is the nature of the experiment,
you might ask?

365
00:34:21,778 --> 00:34:24,725
What do these subjects believe
they are accomplishing,

366
00:34:24,805 --> 00:34:27,260
as they struggle to
fulfill their tasks?

367
00:34:27,369 --> 00:34:29,761
You, as the observer,
don't need to know.

368
00:34:29,933 --> 00:34:33,093
All you need to know is the
subjects believe their job

369
00:34:33,184 --> 00:34:35,288
is of the utmost importance.

370
00:34:35,375 --> 00:34:38,299
Remember, everything
that occurs,

371
00:34:38,454 --> 00:34:43,448
no matter how minute or seemingly
unimportant, must be recorded.

372
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:45,872
Each time a notebook is filled

373
00:34:46,323 --> 00:34:49,531
with the fruits of your
diligent observation--

374
00:34:51,432 --> 00:34:53,229
...one of the
containers provided.

375
00:34:53,580 --> 00:35:00,164
Then, simply place the container in
the pneumatic tube, and... presto.

376
00:35:00,738 --> 00:35:03,772
It will be transported
directly to us.

377
00:35:04,041 --> 00:35:08,422
At the end of your 8-hour shift,
proceed to the Pala ferry,

378
00:35:08,514 --> 00:35:10,326
which will take you back to--

379
00:35:10,698 --> 00:35:14,519
...on behalf of the Degroots,
Alvar Hanso,

380
00:35:14,673 --> 00:35:18,549
and all of us here at the
Dharma Initiative, thank you.

381
00:35:19,172 --> 00:35:20,471
Namaste...

382
00:35:21,544 --> 00:35:23,258
and good luck.

383
00:35:36,141 --> 00:35:38,596
Would you like to
watch that again?

384
00:35:39,427 --> 00:35:40,169
No.

385
00:35:42,804 --> 00:35:45,193
No, I've seen enough.

386
00:35:49,987 --> 00:35:51,124
What are you doing?

387
00:35:52,221 --> 00:35:53,954
I am taking this back with us.

388
00:35:55,956 --> 00:35:57,116
Why?

389
00:35:58,369 --> 00:36:00,165
Because  they may be important.

390
00:36:00,789 --> 00:36:02,433
Important?

391
00:36:04,046 --> 00:36:07,992
I'm sorry, weren't you just
watching the same thing I was?

392
00:36:08,229 --> 00:36:09,799
Yes, John.

393
00:36:10,449 --> 00:36:14,248
And I believe the work you have been
doing is more important now than ever.

394
00:36:14,403 --> 00:36:18,212
- What... work?
- Pushing the button.

395
00:36:23,708 --> 00:36:25,421
That's not work.

396
00:36:25,681 --> 00:36:29,030
That's a-- that's a-- a joke.

397
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:33,816
Rats in a maze...
with no cheese.

398
00:36:33,904 --> 00:36:35,713
It is work, John.

399
00:36:36,181 --> 00:36:40,319
- We are being tested.
- Tested?

400
00:36:40,669 --> 00:36:43,636
The reason to do it--
push the button--

401
00:36:43,715 --> 00:36:46,871
is not because we are
told to do so in a film.

402
00:36:47,897 --> 00:36:54,220
All right. Well, then,
what is the reason... Mr. Eko?

403
00:36:54,348 --> 00:36:57,115
We do it because we
believe we are meant to.

404
00:36:58,399 --> 00:37:01,253
Isn't that the reason
you pushed it, John?

405
00:37:04,697 --> 00:37:06,911
I was never...

406
00:37:07,185 --> 00:37:10,172
meant to do... anything!

407
00:37:14,039 --> 00:37:19,715
Every single second of
my pathetic little life,

408
00:37:19,816 --> 00:37:22,467
is as useless as that button!

409
00:37:23,518 --> 00:37:26,816
You think it's important?
You think it's necessary?

410
00:37:26,905 --> 00:37:28,907
It's nothing. It's nothing.

411
00:37:30,124 --> 00:37:32,201
It's meaningless.

412
00:37:33,345 --> 00:37:35,844
And who are you to
tell me that it's not?

413
00:37:39,703 --> 00:37:42,340
That's flight 815,
leaving from gate 23.

414
00:37:43,089 --> 00:37:44,899
Thank you.

415
00:37:53,104 --> 00:37:56,349
- What are you doing here?
- I had to see you.

416
00:37:56,471 --> 00:37:58,055
Look, your father
said I shouldn't--

417
00:37:58,085 --> 00:38:00,150
I know.
He doesn't want me talking to you.

418
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:02,031
And I know you probably
think I'm crazy.

419
00:38:02,061 --> 00:38:05,011
But I have a message for you,
and I promised to deliver it.

420
00:38:05,262 --> 00:38:06,772
A message?

421
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:12,640
He says you were a good priest.

422
00:38:12,730 --> 00:38:14,365
Who says that?

423
00:38:14,540 --> 00:38:16,370
Yemi.

424
00:38:19,730 --> 00:38:23,704
Speaking about my brother...
is not a joke.

425
00:38:24,108 --> 00:38:26,872
So you should be very
careful what you say next.

426
00:38:27,621 --> 00:38:31,768
I saw him when I was...
between places.

427
00:38:31,876 --> 00:38:33,665
He said that you
would come and see me.

428
00:38:33,695 --> 00:38:36,904
He said even though you were pretending,
you were a good man.

429
00:38:37,271 --> 00:38:40,400
Who put you up to this?
Did your father tell you to do this?

430
00:38:40,492 --> 00:38:42,557
He wants you to knowt
hat he will see you soon.

431
00:38:42,587 --> 00:38:45,034
He said that even though you
don't have faith in yourself,

432
00:38:45,064 --> 00:38:46,830
he has faith in you.

433
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:49,684
Why are you doing this to me?

434
00:38:49,773 --> 00:38:52,732
What do you want from me?
Why are you doing this to me?

435
00:38:52,814 --> 00:38:56,695
Is everything... all right?

436
00:39:04,025 --> 00:39:05,291
He has faith in you.

437
00:39:06,426 --> 00:39:08,081
One day, you'll believe me.

438
00:39:15,947 --> 00:39:18,779
This cross was worn
by my brother, Yemi.

439
00:39:19,793 --> 00:39:25,389
Yemi was a great man, a priest.
A man of God.

440
00:39:25,552 --> 00:39:29,438
And because I betrayed him,
he was shot and died.

441
00:39:30,585 --> 00:39:33,254
He was placed on a plane

442
00:39:33,563 --> 00:39:38,388
which took off from an airstrip in
Nigeria, half a world from here.

443
00:39:41,676 --> 00:39:46,354
Then, the plane that I was
on crashed on this island.

444
00:39:47,361 --> 00:39:52,059
And somehow, here--
I found my brother again.

445
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:55,793
I found him in the same plane
that took off from Nigeria,

446
00:39:55,878 --> 00:39:58,267
in the same plane that
lies above us now,

447
00:39:58,357 --> 00:40:00,972
that has concealed this place.

448
00:40:02,434 --> 00:40:06,447
And I took this cross
from around Yemi's neck,

449
00:40:06,696 --> 00:40:11,944
and put it back on mine--
just as it was

450
00:40:12,503 --> 00:40:17,068
on the day I first took
another man's life.

451
00:40:23,317 --> 00:40:29,773
So let me ask you,
how can you say this is meaningless?

452
00:40:34,365 --> 00:40:39,014
I believe the work being done in the
hatch is more important than anything.

453
00:40:42,610 --> 00:40:46,530
If you will not continue
to push that button, John,

454
00:40:48,121 --> 00:40:50,017
I will.

455
00:41:23,243 --> 00:41:24,265
Can...

456
00:41:26,409 --> 00:41:27,607
can I talk to her?

457
00:41:30,178 --> 00:41:30,959
Sure.

458
00:41:53,558 --> 00:41:54,371
Hey.

459
00:41:58,939 --> 00:42:00,066
It's Hurley.

460
00:42:02,813 --> 00:42:04,021
Hugo.

461
00:42:15,785 --> 00:42:17,385
I'm sorry I forgot
the blankets.

462
00:42:22,201 --> 00:42:24,140
I'm sorry I forgot
the blankets.

463
00:42:33,067 --> 00:42:34,040
Libby?

464
00:42:49,328 --> 00:42:50,518
Michael...

465
00:42:51,069 --> 00:42:56,599
Michael... he's okay. He made it,
Libby, he's okay. It's all right.

466
