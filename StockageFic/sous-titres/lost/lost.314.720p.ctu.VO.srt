1
00:00:30,634 --> 00:00:33,616
And now dancing on stage three,

2
00:00:33,827 --> 00:00:35,976
the pride of St. Paul...

3
00:00:36,096 --> 00:00:37,435
Corvette!

4
00:01:20,798 --> 00:01:22,757
That's the money for the orphanage!

5
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:25,809
That means, Mr. Lashade,
you're the Cobra.

6
00:01:26,756 --> 00:01:28,840
Sorry, baby, it's just business.

7
00:01:29,448 --> 00:01:30,836
All this time it was you!

8
00:01:31,197 --> 00:01:33,918
Pretty and smart, what a shame.

9
00:01:36,371 --> 00:01:37,508
Razzle dazzle!

10
00:01:50,523 --> 00:01:53,167
Autumn, Crystal, bad news.

11
00:01:53,455 --> 00:01:55,450
Corvette was working for the Cobra.

12
00:01:57,453 --> 00:01:58,570
But fear not...

13
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:00,824
He will pay.

14
00:02:01,610 --> 00:02:03,133
And... Cut!

15
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:06,833
- Check the gate!
- Checking.

16
00:02:06,988 --> 00:02:08,150
Here, let me give you a hand.

17
00:02:08,189 --> 00:02:11,952
Thank you. Billy Dee,
it was so great working with you.

18
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:14,013
No, the pleasure's all mine.
Thank you so much.

19
00:02:14,037 --> 00:02:15,211
- You're sweet.
- Take care.

20
00:02:15,246 --> 00:02:16,320
You, too.

21
00:02:16,947 --> 00:02:19,710
All right.
That's a series wrap for Corvette!

22
00:02:20,381 --> 00:02:21,714
Let's hear it for Nikki!

23
00:02:21,822 --> 00:02:22,941
Well done!

24
00:02:24,112 --> 00:02:25,770
Thank you. Thanks.

25
00:02:26,217 --> 00:02:28,132
Brilliant, Nikki, as always.

26
00:02:29,035 --> 00:02:30,752
You know, you don't need to die.

27
00:02:30,937 --> 00:02:32,981
We can bring you back next season.

28
00:02:33,118 --> 00:02:34,140
How?

29
00:02:34,217 --> 00:02:35,772
Well, we could say that...

30
00:02:35,782 --> 00:02:37,893
Corvette was wearing a bulletproof vest.

31
00:02:41,156 --> 00:02:42,242
Bulletproof breast.

32
00:02:43,655 --> 00:02:45,090
Look, I'm just a guest star,

33
00:02:45,091 --> 00:02:47,424
and we all know what happens
to guest stars.

34
00:02:47,632 --> 00:02:49,438
Now that your work's done here,

35
00:02:49,654 --> 00:02:52,886
I suppose you'll be leaving Sydney
and heading back to L.A.

36
00:02:52,962 --> 00:02:54,852
No, I'm not leaving Sydney.

37
00:02:55,635 --> 00:02:56,635
I love you.

38
00:02:57,574 --> 00:02:58,685
And I love you, too.

39
00:03:08,823 --> 00:03:10,037
Son of a bitch.

40
00:03:10,691 --> 00:03:12,273
All right. Come on. Let's go one more.

41
00:03:12,317 --> 00:03:13,571
You said best out of five.

42
00:03:13,638 --> 00:03:15,255
Well, now we're goin' best of seven.

43
00:03:24,615 --> 00:03:25,676
You okay?

44
00:03:31,902 --> 00:03:32,905
What happened?

45
00:03:32,925 --> 00:03:33,991
Pa... l... s...

46
00:03:35,577 --> 00:03:37,365
- What the hell did she say?
- I don't know.

47
00:03:37,366 --> 00:03:39,303
Let's get her some water. Get help.

48
00:03:50,991 --> 00:03:52,421
What are you doin'? Get movin'!

49
00:03:54,425 --> 00:03:55,425
Dude...

50
00:03:57,615 --> 00:03:58,615
Nikki's dead.

51
00:04:02,301 --> 00:04:03,467
Who the hell's Nikki?

52
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:19,936
Subtitles : www.swsub.com

53
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:28,763
Howie, the frittada is amazing.

54
00:04:29,811 --> 00:04:30,837
It's my new chef.

55
00:04:30,972 --> 00:04:32,169
He's fantastic.

56
00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:34,084
Paulo, come in here.

57
00:04:35,152 --> 00:04:38,470
- Yes, sir?
- Paulo, my boy, you have a new fan.

58
00:04:38,904 --> 00:04:40,278
I'd like you to meet Nikki.

59
00:04:40,279 --> 00:04:41,390
The food is amazing.

60
00:04:42,277 --> 00:04:43,277
You're too kind.

61
00:04:44,229 --> 00:04:46,467
The secret is the shaved truffles.

62
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,217
Luckily for you, they are in season.

63
00:04:49,341 --> 00:04:51,583
You know, you should ask for a raise.

64
00:04:55,402 --> 00:04:56,402
Excuse me.

65
00:04:57,215 --> 00:04:58,492
He just came to Sydney.

66
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:01,591
Heard I was hiring
and showed up at my office every day

67
00:05:01,592 --> 00:05:02,980
until I gave him the job.

68
00:05:04,341 --> 00:05:07,137
Apparently, back home, he's the...

69
00:05:07,715 --> 00:05:09,423
Wolfgang Puck of Brazil.

70
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:13,860
Here.

71
00:05:14,007 --> 00:05:16,306
Try one of his homemade rolls.

72
00:05:16,568 --> 00:05:17,627
Please, please do.

73
00:05:24,851 --> 00:05:25,876
It's...

74
00:05:26,149 --> 00:05:27,161
Beautiful.

75
00:05:27,756 --> 00:05:29,489
Howie, you shouldn't have.

76
00:05:30,862 --> 00:05:32,867
I realize, of course, it's not a ring.

77
00:05:32,924 --> 00:05:35,761
Not yet, but, when my wife...

78
00:05:56,677 --> 00:05:57,677
He's gone.

79
00:06:13,962 --> 00:06:16,214
I would have loved it
if you could've figured out a way

80
00:06:16,272 --> 00:06:18,611
where I didn't have to eat
the same food as him.

81
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:23,086
So nobody else knows about this thing?

82
00:06:23,472 --> 00:06:25,748
Everything in here is way off the books.

83
00:06:31,873 --> 00:06:34,052
- What?
- Ashes are evidence, Paulo.

84
00:06:34,246 --> 00:06:36,559
We poisoned him.
Let's not poison ourselves.

85
00:06:52,248 --> 00:06:54,429
Razzle frickin' dazzle.

86
00:06:57,297 --> 00:06:58,358
What happened?

87
00:06:58,558 --> 00:06:59,558
We don't know.

88
00:06:59,807 --> 00:07:01,619
She's got no gunshot wound,
no knife wound,

89
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:03,583
no polar bear bite, nothing.

90
00:07:03,871 --> 00:07:05,593
Maybe it was something she ate.

91
00:07:05,682 --> 00:07:06,840
Maybe she was poisoned.

92
00:07:06,932 --> 00:07:09,755
We should check the food supply
to see if anyone else is sick.

93
00:07:10,211 --> 00:07:12,608
She's got gunk under her fingernails.

94
00:07:14,528 --> 00:07:15,589
Where'd you find her?

95
00:07:15,646 --> 00:07:18,231
Right here.
She stumbled out of the jungle,

96
00:07:18,457 --> 00:07:20,957
face planted.
She said something like "plywood"

97
00:07:21,647 --> 00:07:23,459
and... sayonara.

98
00:07:23,863 --> 00:07:26,237
Actually,
I think she said "power lines."

99
00:07:26,665 --> 00:07:29,259
Who the hell knows what she said?
She was 5 seconds from dying.

100
00:07:29,298 --> 00:07:31,708
She was probably seein' the light
at the end of the tunnel.

101
00:07:31,709 --> 00:07:33,553
"Paulo lies!" That's what she said.

102
00:07:33,584 --> 00:07:35,867
"Paulo lies," not "power lines."
Paulo lies.

103
00:07:36,010 --> 00:07:37,187
Who the hell's Paulo?

104
00:07:37,271 --> 00:07:38,455
Paulo's her...

105
00:07:38,694 --> 00:07:40,887
husband or boyfriend

106
00:07:41,284 --> 00:07:42,935
Whatever. They lived down the beach.

107
00:07:42,993 --> 00:07:44,479
Well, where the hell is he?

108
00:07:44,759 --> 00:07:47,595
'cause if he lies,
that might be a good place to start.

109
00:07:51,335 --> 00:07:53,512
"English expat, Howard L. Zuckerman,

110
00:07:53,647 --> 00:07:57,096

113
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:05,291
"from heart failure."

114
00:08:13,348 --> 00:08:14,579
Are you chewing gum?

115
00:08:19,968 --> 00:08:20,968
Nicotine gum.

116
00:08:22,155 --> 00:08:23,155
I quit.

117
00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:28,907
A toast...

118
00:08:29,156 --> 00:08:30,544
To our new life together.

119
00:08:30,905 --> 00:08:31,905
Cheers.

120
00:08:32,787 --> 00:08:34,121
There's nowhere to sit.

121
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:37,657
No tables, no chairs, nothing.

122
00:08:38,122 --> 00:08:39,220
Good call, Boone.

123
00:08:39,819 --> 00:08:41,768
You want me to grab a chair
from the restaurant?

124
00:08:41,787 --> 00:08:43,282
Forget it. Let's just leave!

125
00:08:43,294 --> 00:08:45,342
You already screwed us
out of seats in first class.

126
00:08:45,343 --> 00:08:47,180
Why would you be able to find them here?

127
00:08:47,219 --> 00:08:49,167
Hey, can I have this chair, please?

128
00:08:49,284 --> 00:08:51,019
Yeah. Be my guest.

129
00:08:51,156 --> 00:08:52,569
Boone, let's just go!

130
00:08:54,094 --> 00:08:55,094
Thanks anyway.

131
00:08:56,732 --> 00:08:57,843
I'm coming, Shannon.

132
00:08:58,045 --> 00:08:59,748
If you quit flirting with random guys,

133
00:08:59,806 --> 00:09:01,707
maybe we could actually
get on the plane.

134
00:09:02,339 --> 00:09:04,538
Promise me we'll never end up like them.

135
00:09:10,182 --> 00:09:11,281
I promise.

136
00:09:34,629 --> 00:09:36,479
Please help!

137
00:09:59,149 --> 00:10:00,306
Get away from there!

138
00:10:01,065 --> 00:10:02,398
Hey! Get back! Get down!

139
00:10:02,883 --> 00:10:03,994
Get away from there!

140
00:10:25,449 --> 00:10:26,588
Are we alive?

141
00:10:26,707 --> 00:10:27,707
Did we survive?

142
00:10:28,332 --> 00:10:30,555
Look at me. Am I okay? Am I okay?

143
00:10:32,108 --> 00:10:33,641
Do you have a pen?

144
00:10:33,969 --> 00:10:35,020
Pen?

145
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:36,587
Does anybody have a pen?

146
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:51,881
Are you okay?

147
00:10:52,051 --> 00:10:54,926
Yeah, I think so.

148
00:10:55,171 --> 00:10:56,661
Baby, look at me. Look at me.

149
00:10:58,840 --> 00:10:59,957
Where's the bag?

150
00:11:01,646 --> 00:11:03,221
- What?
- The bag.

151
00:11:03,331 --> 00:11:04,475
Paulo, where is it?

152
00:11:10,644 --> 00:11:12,400
I'm telling you, this is the trail.

153
00:11:12,459 --> 00:11:13,934
What do you know about tracking?

154
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:16,107
- Well, I know what a footprint is.
- Over here.

155
00:11:22,901 --> 00:11:24,472
I'm guessin' that's Paulo.

156
00:11:34,653 --> 00:11:36,519
He's just like Nikki. No wound, nothing.

157
00:11:38,972 --> 00:11:39,972
Yeah, I know.

158
00:11:40,785 --> 00:11:42,173
Why are his pants undone?

159
00:11:43,472 --> 00:11:46,829
- And why is his shoe in that tree?
- Maybe he stepped on something.

160
00:11:53,087 --> 00:11:54,087
You see something?

161
00:11:56,729 --> 00:11:57,729
Nothing.

162
00:12:02,191 --> 00:12:03,194
Don't.

163
00:12:07,476 --> 00:12:08,867
Dude,
what are you doing?

164
00:12:09,035 --> 00:12:10,038
Two people are dead.

165
00:12:10,057 --> 00:12:11,882
You ever think
they might have been poisoned.

166
00:12:11,901 --> 00:12:14,688
That's evidence.
You're messing up the crime scene.

167
00:12:14,853 --> 00:12:15,853
Crime scene?

168
00:12:16,411 --> 00:12:18,875
Is there a forensics hatch
I don't know about?

169
00:12:21,089 --> 00:12:21,981
Monster.

170
00:12:26,663 --> 00:12:28,998
How many times do I have to tell you,

171
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:30,850
there's no such thing as monsters?

172
00:12:31,502 --> 00:12:32,883
Maybe it was a dinosaur.

173
00:12:33,613 --> 00:12:36,327
It's not "Jurassic Park," Paulo.
It's the South Pacific.

174
00:12:36,702 --> 00:12:38,912
Then what was it?
You saw the trees move.

175
00:12:39,864 --> 00:12:43,507
Would you start focusing?
We've been here for six days, okay?

176
00:12:43,564 --> 00:12:45,488
The coast guard
is gonna get here any second,

177
00:12:45,554 --> 00:12:47,532
and I really don't think
that they're gonna take,

178
00:12:47,551 --> 00:12:49,608
"hey, you know what?
I'm looking for my script bag"

179
00:12:49,666 --> 00:12:51,598
as an excuse
for not getting on the rescue boat.

180
00:12:53,657 --> 00:12:55,008
Did you guys lose your luggage?

181
00:12:56,013 --> 00:12:59,120
I lost mine, too.
I found some other stuff, though,

182
00:12:59,763 --> 00:13:02,374
so if you need anything,
pants or sweatshirt...

183
00:13:03,389 --> 00:13:05,277
I can help you find some that fit.

184
00:13:07,825 --> 00:13:09,227
I'm Ethan, by the way.

185
00:13:09,678 --> 00:13:11,085
Hi. I'm Nikki...

186
00:13:11,212 --> 00:13:12,736
and this is Paulo.

187
00:13:13,924 --> 00:13:16,084
And you are so sweet, Ethan, but

188
00:13:16,488 --> 00:13:18,656
actually, we're not looking for clothes.

189
00:13:19,376 --> 00:13:21,246
Paulo here lost his nicotine gum.

190
00:13:22,326 --> 00:13:23,936
You might have more luck
looking inland.

191
00:13:24,485 --> 00:13:25,489
In the jungle?

192
00:13:25,490 --> 00:13:27,551
The plane split apart
when it was over the island,

193
00:13:27,552 --> 00:13:30,168
so some of the stuff might have
rained down in there.

194
00:13:32,014 --> 00:13:33,080
Boone took the water!

195
00:13:34,873 --> 00:13:36,065
What is going on?

196
00:13:36,178 --> 00:13:39,194
Someone had to take responsibility.
It would have never lasted.

197
00:13:39,619 --> 00:13:40,871
Leave him alone!

198
00:13:45,246 --> 00:13:46,590
It's been six days,

199
00:13:47,711 --> 00:13:49,872
and we're all still waiting
for someone to come.

200
00:13:51,932 --> 00:13:53,265
We have to stop waiting.

201
00:13:55,933 --> 00:13:57,988
We need to start figuring things out.

202
00:13:59,181 --> 00:14:00,406
Now I found water,

203
00:14:00,783 --> 00:14:02,308
fresh water up in the valley.

204
00:14:03,619 --> 00:14:05,507
I'm taking a group at first light.

205
00:14:06,246 --> 00:14:09,734
If y don't want to come,
then find another way to contribute,

206
00:14:11,093 --> 00:14:13,880
because every man for himself
is not gonna work.

207
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:18,453
But if we can't live together...

208
00:14:22,182 --> 00:14:23,404
we're gonna die alone.

209
00:14:28,557 --> 00:14:29,557
I'm with Jin.

210
00:14:30,057 --> 00:14:31,057
It's the monster.

211
00:14:31,432 --> 00:14:33,269
Yeah, because that makes
the most sense.

212
00:14:33,290 --> 00:14:34,305
It does.

213
00:14:34,306 --> 00:14:36,681
Locke said when Eko died,
his last words were,

214
00:14:36,682 --> 00:14:39,618
"you're next,"
and Nikki and Paulo were with them.

215
00:14:40,994 --> 00:14:42,298
He was talking about them.

216
00:14:42,369 --> 00:14:44,877
He wasn't saying
"you're next" about them.

217
00:14:45,432 --> 00:14:48,733
He was saying "you're next"
as in you're all next.

218
00:14:48,969 --> 00:14:50,717
Yeah, that's not really better.

219
00:14:51,121 --> 00:14:53,338
All right, so here's how I see it.

220
00:14:54,246 --> 00:14:55,698
We wanna know what happened?

221
00:14:55,805 --> 00:14:58,540
We gotta find out whatever we can
about these jabonies.

222
00:14:58,807 --> 00:14:59,807
Ja-bo-nies?

223
00:14:59,930 --> 00:15:00,930
Nina and Pablo.

224
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:02,460
Dude, show some respect.

225
00:15:03,497 --> 00:15:05,237
You know their names.
It Nikki and Paulo.

226
00:15:05,556 --> 00:15:06,556
Whatever, Hugo.

227
00:15:07,058 --> 00:15:08,113
Where's their tent?

228
00:15:09,499 --> 00:15:11,216
And we better get some shovels.

229
00:15:20,839 --> 00:15:21,839
Hey, Dr. Arzt.

230
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:24,150
Oh, hi.

231
00:15:24,492 --> 00:15:26,219
You're a scientist, right?

232
00:15:27,151 --> 00:15:28,910
And an educator, yes.

233
00:15:30,261 --> 00:15:31,940
What are you doing
with all this stuff?

234
00:15:32,422 --> 00:15:34,714
Well, since we got here,
I've discovered 20 new species.

235
00:15:34,779 --> 00:15:36,533
I'm gonna be the next Charles Darwin.

236
00:15:38,789 --> 00:15:41,136
That is, latrodectus regina.

237
00:15:41,727 --> 00:15:43,192
Very dangerous.

238
00:15:43,856 --> 00:15:45,630
They call her the medusa spider.

239
00:15:46,068 --> 00:15:47,677
Her pheromones are very strong,

240
00:15:47,785 --> 00:15:51,345
one whiff, and every male of the species
would be here in seconds.

241
00:15:51,852 --> 00:15:53,145
Not unlike you, I guess.

242
00:15:55,352 --> 00:15:57,750
So you're probably too busy
to help me, then.

243
00:15:58,519 --> 00:16:00,043
No, not at all.

244
00:16:00,102 --> 00:16:01,872
I'm fine. I can help you.

245
00:16:01,968 --> 00:16:03,347
What can I do you for?

246
00:16:03,415 --> 00:16:05,415
Well, I'm trying to find my luggage,

247
00:16:05,416 --> 00:16:08,620
and since the plane broke apart
over the jungle,

248
00:16:08,665 --> 00:16:12,351
I was wondering if you knew
about trajectories and stuff.

249
00:16:13,693 --> 00:16:14,791
Do I?

250
00:16:14,853 --> 00:16:16,464
Do I know about trajectories?

251
00:16:17,506 --> 00:16:19,492
Allow me to draw you a map, madam.

252
00:16:24,462 --> 00:16:27,289
Are you sure we should be listening
to a high school science teacher?

253
00:16:27,290 --> 00:16:29,245
Junior high, and yes.

254
00:16:30,094 --> 00:16:32,260
What's your problem with Leslie, anyway?

255
00:16:32,591 --> 00:16:33,591
Leslie?

256
00:16:34,778 --> 00:16:35,778
You're jealous!

257
00:16:36,031 --> 00:16:37,997
Of him? Never.

258
00:16:38,154 --> 00:16:40,309
Yeah, his spiders
turned me on so much,

259
00:16:40,431 --> 00:16:42,370
I had to sleep with him to get the map.

260
00:16:42,424 --> 00:16:44,610
I wouldn't be surprised.
You slept with Zuckerman.

261
00:16:48,244 --> 00:16:49,342
I did that for us.

262
00:16:53,592 --> 00:16:56,903
Okay, I'm sorry. I'm just...
I don't trust that guy.

263
00:16:58,128 --> 00:17:00,359
We should've gone to Ethan.
He would've helped.

264
00:17:00,417 --> 00:17:01,529
Paulo, look.

265
00:17:05,705 --> 00:17:06,842
Another plane.

266
00:17:08,812 --> 00:17:10,220
Looks like it's been here a while.

267
00:17:10,221 --> 00:17:12,532
Go up there.
Maybe there's a radio or some...

268
00:17:12,533 --> 00:17:13,533
Are you insane?

269
00:17:13,585 --> 00:17:15,553
If I go up there,
that thing's gonna fall.

270
00:17:16,367 --> 00:17:17,692
You're not gonna fall.

271
00:17:17,796 --> 00:17:19,460
What? You want me to die?

272
00:17:20,947 --> 00:17:22,913
Come on. Let's keep going.

273
00:17:28,254 --> 00:17:29,392
What is that?

274
00:17:48,736 --> 00:17:50,220
Okay. Let's do it.

275
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58,337
Let's check it out.

276
00:18:00,177 --> 00:18:02,994
So our carry-on bag fell from the sky,

277
00:18:03,028 --> 00:18:05,016
opened a manhole, crawled inside

278
00:18:05,093 --> 00:18:06,856
and closed the doors
behind itself?

279
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:08,866
You don't wanna climb up to a plane...

280
00:18:09,091 --> 00:18:12,194
but now you want to climb down
a ladder into a dark tunnel?

281
00:18:13,457 --> 00:18:14,457
I don't think so.

282
00:18:21,051 --> 00:18:22,309
Hey, man, be careful.

283
00:18:23,581 --> 00:18:25,355
Why? They don't live here anymore.

284
00:18:25,518 --> 00:18:26,851
So Sun checked the food.

285
00:18:28,123 --> 00:18:30,940
They're eating the same as us,
and no one else is sick.

286
00:18:31,208 --> 00:18:32,208
Could be a virus.

287
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:34,527
Dude... Monster.

288
00:18:37,581 --> 00:18:39,023
Creepy. They collected bugs?

289
00:18:40,378 --> 00:18:42,095
I think these were Arzt's.

290
00:18:42,615 --> 00:18:45,892
He collected all kinds of
different creepy crawlies before he...

291
00:18:46,394 --> 00:18:47,394
Exploded.

292
00:18:47,621 --> 00:18:48,689
They must've been friends.

293
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,022
<i>Exposé.</i>

294
00:18:52,001 --> 00:18:53,390
Did you just say <i>Exposé</i>?

295
00:18:54,389 --> 00:18:55,816
What the hell's <i>Exposé</i>?

296
00:18:56,142 --> 00:18:58,557
Only the most awesome hour
of television ever.

297
00:18:58,812 --> 00:19:00,812
It was like <i>Baywatch,</i> only better.

298
00:19:01,033 --> 00:19:04,293
You've got Autumn and Crystal--
two stripers that solve crimes

299
00:19:04,332 --> 00:19:07,795
with the help of their suave,
smooth-talking club owner, Mr. Lashade.

300
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:09,394
How'd I miss that one?

301
00:19:09,544 --> 00:19:12,255
Check it out.
Look at the cast list. Nikki Fernandez.

302
00:19:12,636 --> 00:19:14,720
That's gotta be
why she was in Australia.

303
00:19:14,795 --> 00:19:16,293
This must've been her big break.

304
00:19:16,294 --> 00:19:17,794
Certainly sounds like it.

305
00:19:18,419 --> 00:19:19,419
No way.

306
00:19:20,793 --> 00:19:22,237
Mr. Lashade was the Cobra?

307
00:19:22,530 --> 00:19:24,459
Is that supposed to mean something?

308
00:19:24,606 --> 00:19:26,494
Dude, the Cobra's the big bad guy.

309
00:19:26,856 --> 00:19:29,597
His identity's been shrouded
in mystery for four seasons.

310
00:19:33,239 --> 00:19:34,363
They had a walkie-talkie?

311
00:19:35,063 --> 00:19:37,667
Every damn one of those bastards
on the other side of the island

312
00:19:37,706 --> 00:19:39,925
had one exactly like this
hanging from their belts.

313
00:19:40,004 --> 00:19:41,634
So how did Nikki and Paulo get one?

314
00:19:42,795 --> 00:19:43,795
I'll tell you how.

315
00:19:46,794 --> 00:19:48,471
They were working with the others.

316
00:19:53,108 --> 00:19:54,350
What gives you the right?

317
00:19:54,369 --> 00:19:56,809
You have to understand.
We thought it was best for everybody.

318
00:19:56,867 --> 00:19:58,047
I'm sorry.
Are you my mother?

319
00:19:58,048 --> 00:20:00,670
Because she knows what's best for me.
Other than that, I decide.

320
00:20:00,767 --> 00:20:01,886
Hey. What's going on?

321
00:20:03,171 --> 00:20:06,254
Kate and her two boyfriends found a case
of guns that fell out of the plane,

322
00:20:06,292 --> 00:20:07,952
but they decided not to tell the camp.

323
00:20:07,998 --> 00:20:09,561
Look, the case is locked.

324
00:20:09,670 --> 00:20:11,482
The key is around Jack's neck,
all right?

325
00:20:11,483 --> 00:20:12,974
I promise you, they're safe.

326
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:14,489
You're all out of control.

327
00:20:15,476 --> 00:20:16,923
The pigs are walkin'.

328
00:20:17,711 --> 00:20:19,278
The pigs are walking!

329
00:20:24,586 --> 00:20:28,297
So... where did you say
you found that case?

330
00:20:32,448 --> 00:20:34,223
It's just water, Paulo.

331
00:20:34,585 --> 00:20:36,599
Stop being such a wuss and dive in.

332
00:20:37,023 --> 00:20:38,023
Why me?

333
00:20:38,399 --> 00:20:40,676
Well, as you had
no trouble reminding me,

334
00:20:40,954 --> 00:20:44,557
I slept with Howie Zuckerman, so
the least you could do is go for a swim.

335
00:20:44,613 --> 00:20:46,594
And Kate said they found the case
on the bottom.

336
00:20:46,650 --> 00:20:48,241
- Let me ask you something.
- What?

337
00:20:48,651 --> 00:20:51,859
If you didn't need me to find that bag,
would we still be together?

338
00:20:51,962 --> 00:20:54,098
That bag is worth $8 million.

339
00:20:55,774 --> 00:20:57,757
Just dive in, Paulo.

340
00:21:28,026 --> 00:21:29,026
Well?

341
00:21:31,525 --> 00:21:32,525
Nothing.

342
00:21:32,556 --> 00:21:34,213
There's nothing down there?

343
00:21:37,838 --> 00:21:38,838
Just dead bodies.

344
00:21:48,961 --> 00:21:50,677
Okay, so they had
a walkie-talkie.

345
00:21:50,774 --> 00:21:53,282
You think they were working
with the others? Like, how?

346
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:54,399
Like Michael.

347
00:21:55,210 --> 00:21:57,749
If that's the case,
then why'd they kill Nikki and Paulo?

348
00:21:58,276 --> 00:22:00,266
Who knows why those people do anything?

349
00:22:00,536 --> 00:22:03,430
What matters is they could be out there
right now waiting to get us.

350
00:22:03,587 --> 00:22:04,642
I don't know, dude.

351
00:22:05,401 --> 00:22:07,185
I was with the others,
like, two weeks ago.

352
00:22:07,273 --> 00:22:09,129
They're on the total
other side of the island.

353
00:22:09,212 --> 00:22:11,212
Then who dragged me into the jungle?

354
00:22:13,711 --> 00:22:15,377
The others came into our camp.

355
00:22:15,711 --> 00:22:17,933
They grabbed me, put a bag over my head.

356
00:22:18,525 --> 00:22:20,978
And if I hadn't gotten away,
they would have killed me.

357
00:22:23,047 --> 00:22:24,269
Look, y'all stay here.

358
00:22:24,673 --> 00:22:26,691
Let me see if I can see any sign of 'em.

359
00:22:26,883 --> 00:22:28,272
I'll do a perimeter sweep.

360
00:22:28,399 --> 00:22:30,746
- Where'd you get the gun?
- Got it off one of them.

361
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:32,935
And when were you gonna let us know?

362
00:22:33,423 --> 00:22:34,637
I guess right now.

363
00:22:40,489 --> 00:22:42,377
What exactly is a perimeter sweep?

364
00:22:43,878 --> 00:22:45,458
Shouldn't we cover them up?

365
00:22:45,673 --> 00:22:46,713
Yes, of course.

366
00:23:15,833 --> 00:23:16,950
Nice night.

367
00:23:21,198 --> 00:23:22,475
- Whatcha doing?
- Nothing.

368
00:23:23,817 --> 00:23:25,831
It looks like you're digging a hole.

369
00:23:30,191 --> 00:23:33,466
Every man's entitled to his secrets,
but can I give you
a piece of advice?

370
00:23:34,693 --> 00:23:35,693
Please, John.

371
00:23:35,756 --> 00:23:38,475
You should put the shovel away
and save yourself some trouble.

372
00:23:38,566 --> 00:23:39,566
Why is that?

373
00:23:40,754 --> 00:23:42,550
Things don't stay buried on this island.

374
00:23:45,758 --> 00:23:46,924
The beach is eroding.

375
00:23:47,931 --> 00:23:49,436
Winter's coming, high tide.

376
00:23:49,819 --> 00:23:53,591
Whatever it is you're hiding, make sure
you pick a spot that won't wash away.

377
00:23:54,683 --> 00:23:55,922
See you back at camp.

378
00:24:47,771 --> 00:24:49,025
<i>Who left this open?</i>

379
00:24:49,108 --> 00:24:50,902
<i>Tom was down here
a couple of days ago.</i>

380
00:24:51,042 --> 00:24:53,048
<i>Well, have him cover it up
with the plane.</i>

381
00:25:01,714 --> 00:25:02,728
That him?

382
00:25:03,499 --> 00:25:04,701
- Shephard?
- Yes.

383
00:25:07,631 --> 00:25:08,631
He's cute.

384
00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:12,887
Why are we doing this?

385
00:25:13,565 --> 00:25:15,831
Shephard will never agree
to do the surgery.

386
00:25:15,942 --> 00:25:17,528
No. I can convince him to do it.

387
00:25:18,169 --> 00:25:19,153
How?

388
00:25:19,256 --> 00:25:21,422
Same way I get anybody to do anything.

389
00:25:22,651 --> 00:25:25,080
I find out what
he's emotionally iested in,

390
00:25:26,128 --> 00:25:27,265
and I exploit it.

391
00:25:29,756 --> 00:25:32,939
So what,
we just grab all three of them,

392
00:25:33,006 --> 00:25:34,172
Ford and Austen, too?

393
00:25:34,206 --> 00:25:35,756
No, they need to come to us.

394
00:25:35,757 --> 00:25:37,479
And how do we make that happen?

395
00:25:37,564 --> 00:25:38,619
Michael, of course.

396
00:25:41,817 --> 00:25:42,817
Are we done here?

397
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:44,918
This place gives me the creeps.

398
00:26:18,941 --> 00:26:20,877
You hear about what happened
to Nikki and Paulo?

399
00:26:20,878 --> 00:26:22,169
Aye. Tragic.

400
00:26:22,631 --> 00:26:24,401
So... do you know anything?

401
00:26:26,566 --> 00:26:27,566
How do you mean?

402
00:26:28,005 --> 00:26:31,667
Can you... you know,
use your psychic powers?

403
00:26:31,878 --> 00:26:33,155
Doesn't work like that.

404
00:26:34,379 --> 00:26:35,434
I only see flashes.

405
00:26:36,191 --> 00:26:37,524
No offense, dude, but...

406
00:26:38,414 --> 00:26:39,839
as far as superpowers go...

407
00:26:41,151 --> 00:26:42,458
yours is just kinda lame.

408
00:26:43,904 --> 00:26:44,904
Thanks anyway.

409
00:26:46,495 --> 00:26:48,810
I do know she was
with your mate this morning.

410
00:26:50,405 --> 00:26:51,405
My mate?

411
00:26:52,151 --> 00:26:54,373
I saw her with your boy Sawyer...

412
00:26:57,088 --> 00:26:58,310
The dead girl, Nikki.

413
00:26:59,655 --> 00:27:01,155
He said he didn't know her.

414
00:27:01,502 --> 00:27:03,181
Then why was she yelling at him?

415
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:04,780
Yelling?

416
00:27:06,727 --> 00:27:08,020
At Sawyer, this morning?

417
00:27:11,686 --> 00:27:12,979
Right before she died.

418
00:27:26,076 --> 00:27:27,286
Vincent! Dude!

419
00:27:29,137 --> 00:27:31,137
So he saw Sawyer and Nikki fightin'.

420
00:27:31,216 --> 00:27:34,348
- That doesn't prove athing.
- Look at the facts and ask yourself,

421
00:27:34,717 --> 00:27:37,047
why is Sawyer so gung how
about investigating this?

422
00:27:37,218 --> 00:27:38,384
What's in it for him?

423
00:27:38,528 --> 00:27:40,484
He pretended he didn't know their names,

424
00:27:40,590 --> 00:27:42,028
but then he was fighting with Nikki.

425
00:27:42,136 --> 00:27:43,660
Sawyer's not a murderer.

426
00:27:44,090 --> 00:27:46,902
He went all the way across
the island to help Michael.

427
00:27:47,654 --> 00:27:49,866
It is the others.
I know what they can do.

428
00:27:50,342 --> 00:27:51,453
Okay, you know what?

429
00:27:51,655 --> 00:27:54,056
I'll go get Desmond.
He'll tell you exactly what he saw.

430
00:28:04,282 --> 00:28:05,282
It was me.

431
00:28:06,462 --> 00:28:07,542
What?

432
00:28:10,323 --> 00:28:13,366
It was me who took you, not the others.

433
00:28:19,532 --> 00:28:20,532
I wasn't myself.

434
00:28:21,842 --> 00:28:23,008
After Locke hit me...

435
00:28:23,493 --> 00:28:25,094
After he humiliated me...

436
00:28:27,466 --> 00:28:30,242
Sawyer told me I could get even
by helping him steal the guns.

437
00:28:30,279 --> 00:28:31,358
We just made it...

438
00:28:32,467 --> 00:28:34,629
look like... the others.

439
00:28:38,154 --> 00:28:39,598
I didn't mean to hurt you.

440
00:28:44,841 --> 00:28:45,841
Sorry.

441
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:54,494
Hey, everybody.
We're heading out to the pearl station.

442
00:28:54,495 --> 00:28:56,930
There's a computer there that
might help us find our people.

443
00:28:56,931 --> 00:28:58,741
- Anybody wanna come along?
- I'll go.

444
00:28:58,798 --> 00:29:00,236
- Great.
- What?

445
00:29:00,811 --> 00:29:03,493
Anybody else wanna come, meet us
at the tree line in ten minutes,

446
00:29:03,494 --> 00:29:04,494
and bring water.

447
00:29:04,742 --> 00:29:05,797
You're not serious.

448
00:29:07,118 --> 00:29:09,917
What? You always whine
about not being included.

449
00:29:10,294 --> 00:29:11,431
Now's our chance.

450
00:29:18,616 --> 00:29:19,650
Hey, guys,

451
00:29:20,750 --> 00:29:22,254
what are these other tvs for?

452
00:29:23,304 --> 00:29:24,304
Sorry?

453
00:29:25,033 --> 00:29:26,305
<i>All these tvs.</i>

454
00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:29,353
<i>This guy says
that there's six stations...</i>

455
00:29:50,127 --> 00:29:53,436
<i>So maybe some of these tvs
are connected to the other hatches.</i>

456
00:29:53,497 --> 00:29:55,272
<i>Well, I'm suddenly feeling very stupid.</i>

457
00:29:55,369 --> 00:29:58,262
<i>Perhaps I could patch in
one of the other feeds,</i>

458
00:29:58,355 --> 00:30:00,419
<i>see if we can get another picture.</i>

459
00:30:11,268 --> 00:30:12,545
The toilet still works.

460
00:30:30,457 --> 00:30:31,457
Give me the gun.

461
00:30:32,283 --> 00:30:33,654
What the hell you talking about?

462
00:30:34,016 --> 00:30:35,016
Give it to me.

463
00:30:38,155 --> 00:30:39,332
It ain't even loaded.

464
00:30:40,768 --> 00:30:42,923
Then how are you
sweeping the perimeter?

465
00:30:43,393 --> 00:30:44,393
Quit lying, dude.

466
00:30:44,508 --> 00:30:46,635
Desmond saw you fighting
with Nikki this morning.

467
00:30:51,145 --> 00:30:52,605
Oh, I see what this is.

468
00:30:54,081 --> 00:30:56,312
The villagers have got
themselves some torches.

469
00:30:57,096 --> 00:30:58,096
Did you kill them?

470
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:03,436
No, I didn't kill them.

471
00:31:05,596 --> 00:31:07,772
Yeah, me and Nikki
went at it this morning...

472
00:31:09,471 --> 00:31:10,693
'cause she wanted a gun.

473
00:31:10,961 --> 00:31:12,485
Why didn't you tell us this before?

474
00:31:17,221 --> 00:31:19,119
'cause of the dirt under her nails.

475
00:31:19,971 --> 00:31:21,702
- What?
- She was digging,

476
00:31:22,531 --> 00:31:24,915
and when we found him,
I saw a fresh mound of dirt.

477
00:31:25,594 --> 00:31:27,107
She was burying somethin',

478
00:31:27,357 --> 00:31:30,101
and if you take the time to dig a hole
right before you die,

479
00:31:31,095 --> 00:31:33,484
then what you're hiding's
probably pretty damn good.

480
00:31:34,197 --> 00:31:35,345
So what was it?

481
00:31:35,846 --> 00:31:36,846
What did she hide?

482
00:31:50,410 --> 00:31:51,465
Go ahead. Take 'em.

483
00:31:53,264 --> 00:31:56,184
'cause whatever happened to those two,
I had nothing to do with it.

484
00:32:20,987 --> 00:32:23,367
Did you know thanksgiving
was two weeks ago?

485
00:32:26,129 --> 00:32:29,299
We missed it, Paulo,
just like we're gonna miss everything.

486
00:32:30,172 --> 00:32:31,560
They're going to find us.

487
00:32:32,301 --> 00:32:33,301
We'll get rescued.

488
00:32:33,615 --> 00:32:34,615
You'll see.

489
00:32:35,612 --> 00:32:39,253
Okay, where did this sudden
burst of optimism come from?

490
00:32:41,364 --> 00:32:42,697
I don't know. I guess...

491
00:32:43,487 --> 00:32:45,153
It's how you look at things...

492
00:32:46,926 --> 00:32:47,926
Like the bag.

493
00:32:48,547 --> 00:32:52,305
I mean,
maybe not finding it was good for us.

494
00:32:53,175 --> 00:32:54,452
How do you figure that?

495
00:32:54,985 --> 00:32:55,985
Look what it did.

496
00:32:58,173 --> 00:33:00,115
It might have... torn us apart.

497
00:33:10,691 --> 00:33:11,791
Wait here.

498
00:33:12,738 --> 00:33:14,515
I'm gonna get us some breakfast.

499
00:33:44,255 --> 00:33:45,989
Okay, I know you have them.

500
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:47,799
Give me a gun.

501
00:33:48,865 --> 00:33:50,087
I don't have the guns.

502
00:33:50,410 --> 00:33:51,722
- A- team took 'em all.
- Right,

503
00:33:51,761 --> 00:33:53,946
except for the ones
you kept for yourself.

504
00:33:54,426 --> 00:33:56,850
Even if I had a gun,
I wouldn't give it to you.

505
00:33:57,422 --> 00:33:59,375
Judging by the fire you're breathin',

506
00:33:59,864 --> 00:34:01,617
I got a feeling
no good would come of it.

507
00:34:01,673 --> 00:34:04,185
Sawyer, give me a gun.

508
00:34:04,739 --> 00:34:06,294
I got a better idea, sister.

509
00:34:06,613 --> 00:34:09,458
How about you go stick your head
in the ocean and cool yourself off?

510
00:34:11,674 --> 00:34:12,729
Thanks for nothin'.

511
00:34:15,989 --> 00:34:17,266
And who the hell are you?

512
00:34:26,549 --> 00:34:27,604
Thanks for nothin'.

513
00:34:44,923 --> 00:34:46,867
Charlie told me it was your idea...

514
00:34:48,864 --> 00:34:49,864
to kidnap me.

515
00:34:58,673 --> 00:34:59,728
You gonna tell Jin?

516
00:35:09,968 --> 00:35:11,049
Why not?

517
00:35:11,302 --> 00:35:13,643
Because then we'd have
to dig another grave.

518
00:35:22,421 --> 00:35:23,714
Why are you giving me these?

519
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:26,022
Because they're worthless here.

520
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:30,614
See, I thought I was gonna
get out of this without a...

521
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:42,237
Nikki and Paulo...

522
00:35:44,048 --> 00:35:46,081
I guess we didn't
really know you very well,

523
00:35:48,239 --> 00:35:51,282
and it appears you killed
each other for diamonds.

524
00:35:53,235 --> 00:35:55,537
But I know there are
good parts to you, too.

525
00:35:56,236 --> 00:35:57,771
You were always nice to me,

526
00:36:00,413 --> 00:36:01,903
and you were a member of the camp.

527
00:36:03,363 --> 00:36:04,363
And...

528
00:36:06,196 --> 00:36:07,933
I really loved <i>Exposé.</i>

529
00:36:11,984 --> 00:36:13,045
Okay, then.

530
00:36:13,465 --> 00:36:15,073
- Good-bye.
- Wait.

531
00:36:28,469 --> 00:36:30,206
Rest in peace, Nikki and Paulo.

532
00:36:37,653 --> 00:36:39,705
Come on, Nikki, just tell me.

533
00:36:39,902 --> 00:36:41,056
It's a surprise.

534
00:36:41,442 --> 00:36:42,497
We're almost there.

535
00:36:44,695 --> 00:36:45,695
Okay, ready?

536
00:36:49,317 --> 00:36:50,503
I found the diamonds.

537
00:36:53,131 --> 00:36:54,904
What? Where?

538
00:36:56,569 --> 00:36:57,569
Right here.

539
00:37:00,941 --> 00:37:01,941
Give them to me.

540
00:37:04,693 --> 00:37:06,193
What are you talking about?

541
00:37:06,379 --> 00:37:07,712
What am I talking about?

542
00:37:09,216 --> 00:37:10,256
What's this?

543
00:37:10,387 --> 00:37:11,504
Your nicotine gum?

544
00:37:12,091 --> 00:37:15,101
You wanted to stop looking for the bag
because you'd already found it.

545
00:37:16,441 --> 00:37:18,607
I know you have them, Paulo,
so where are they?

546
00:37:18,691 --> 00:37:19,977
Calm down, okay?

547
00:37:22,232 --> 00:37:23,467
What the hell is that?

548
00:37:26,848 --> 00:37:28,121
Are you out of your mind?

549
00:37:28,445 --> 00:37:29,956
You remember Dr. Arzt's friend.

550
00:37:30,597 --> 00:37:31,753
Did it bite you?

551
00:37:33,855 --> 00:37:34,858
Does it hurt?

552
00:37:35,695 --> 00:37:38,080
He told me why they call it
"the medusa spider."

553
00:37:38,191 --> 00:37:39,468
Wanna know why?

554
00:37:42,398 --> 00:37:43,444
What did you do?

555
00:37:47,482 --> 00:37:50,762
Because one look from medusa
would turn anyone to stone,

556
00:37:51,316 --> 00:37:53,923
just like one bite from the spider
will paralyze you...

557
00:37:54,628 --> 00:37:56,726
For... oh, about eight hours.

558
00:37:57,943 --> 00:37:58,943
It won't kill you.

559
00:37:59,004 --> 00:38:00,004
It'll just...

560
00:38:00,084 --> 00:38:02,477
slow your heart rate down to the point
where even a doctor

561
00:38:02,515 --> 00:38:03,830
would have a hard time...

562
00:38:04,643 --> 00:38:05,762
hearing it beat.

563
00:38:07,444 --> 00:38:09,670
You won't be able to move a muscle,

564
00:38:09,728 --> 00:38:13,292
so I'll be able to do all sorts
of nasty things to you.

565
00:38:14,723 --> 00:38:16,655
And since it bit you on your neck,

566
00:38:16,862 --> 00:38:19,563
I'd say paralysis will happen fast.

567
00:38:25,361 --> 00:38:27,869
I'm guessing that
you have the diamonds on you.

568
00:38:37,079 --> 00:38:38,254
In a shoe, maybe?

569
00:38:47,319 --> 00:38:48,882
I think I know where.

570
00:38:59,194 --> 00:39:00,194
Son of a bitch.

571
00:39:04,066 --> 00:39:05,066
I'm sorry.

572
00:39:05,237 --> 00:39:07,166
You're only sorry 'cause you got caught.

573
00:39:10,819 --> 00:39:13,055
I was... afraid...

574
00:39:14,051 --> 00:39:15,130
of losing you.

575
00:39:19,270 --> 00:39:20,935
If you found the diamonds...

576
00:39:22,317 --> 00:39:23,836
you wouldn't need me anymore.

577
00:40:03,423 --> 00:40:04,484
Damn it!

578
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:31,482
You okay?

579
00:40:40,122 --> 00:40:41,269
Hey, what happened?

580
00:40:41,327 --> 00:40:42,828
I'm paralyzed.
