00:00:00,845 --> 00:00:02,184
<i>Previously on</i> Lost...

2
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:04,990
There's a rental car parked out front.
Got to Sue city.

3
00:00:05,078 --> 00:00:07,744
I want you to check in
at the Sage Flower motel.

4
00:00:07,894 --> 00:00:10,254
Wait for me. I'll be there in the a.m.

5
00:00:10,376 --> 00:00:11,381
I love you.

6
00:00:11,488 --> 00:00:12,724
I love you, too.

7
00:00:22,306 --> 00:00:23,657
I don't care what Jack said.

8
00:00:23,708 --> 00:00:26,197
They've got him, and we have
to get him back. I owe him that.

9
00:00:26,236 --> 00:00:27,951
Obviously,
the circumstances have changed.

10
00:00:27,952 --> 00:00:29,363
He may not want to be rescued.

11
00:00:29,381 --> 00:00:32,139
If he's shaking hands with the others,
I'm sure he has a good reason.

12
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:34,579
We came here to rescue Jack,
and that's what we're gonna do.

13
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:36,577
What are you doing here?

14
00:00:36,578 --> 00:00:37,578
I came to get you.

15
00:00:37,891 --> 00:00:38,891
Get outta here.

16
00:00:39,508 --> 00:00:40,608
Don't hurt her!

17
00:00:42,464 --> 00:00:43,738
I made a deal with them.

18
00:00:44,135 --> 00:00:45,468
They're gonna let me go.

19
00:00:46,133 --> 00:00:47,133
Where?

20
00:00:47,395 --> 00:00:48,417
Home.

21
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:51,512
Jack, we need to go.

22
00:00:54,744 --> 00:00:56,132
Hey, hold it right there!

23
00:00:56,183 --> 00:00:58,137
Get your hands up! Get down!

24
00:00:58,494 --> 00:00:59,573
I said get down!

25
00:01:00,496 --> 00:01:01,808
What are you doing here, John?

26
00:01:01,809 --> 00:01:02,809
I'm sorry, Jack.

27
00:01:02,931 --> 00:01:03,931
Sorry for what?

28
00:01:54,513 --> 00:01:56,635
I was just bringing you
something to eat.

29
00:02:00,042 --> 00:02:01,153
Enjoy your sandwich.

30
00:02:19,992 --> 00:02:21,651
Been on the road a while, huh?

31
00:02:21,854 --> 00:02:23,298
How long is it gonna take?

32
00:02:23,725 --> 00:02:25,133
Well, your fan belt's shot.

33
00:02:25,195 --> 00:02:26,854
I'll take two days, maybe three.

34
00:02:28,794 --> 00:02:30,238
Three days for a fan belt?

35
00:02:31,356 --> 00:02:32,356
Welcome to Iowa.

36
00:02:36,967 --> 00:02:37,967
My name is Johnny.

37
00:02:38,842 --> 00:02:39,842
I'm Lucy.

38
00:02:50,613 --> 00:02:52,195
All 18-karat gold.

39
00:02:52,734 --> 00:02:54,895
Cheapest one in retail for 500 bucks.

40
00:02:55,261 --> 00:02:57,383
Come on. Those don't look real.
I'm not buying.

41
00:02:57,421 --> 00:02:59,042
What do you mean, they don't look real?

42
00:02:59,061 --> 00:03:00,430
My uncle's going out of business.

43
00:03:00,778 --> 00:03:03,479
If you need a lift into town,
I'm finished up here in an hour.

44
00:03:03,893 --> 00:03:06,339
- I call the cops.
- Fine. Whatever. Your loss.

45
00:03:06,358 --> 00:03:07,550
Is there a problem, buddy?

46
00:03:07,551 --> 00:03:09,217
Yeah. Yeah, there's a problem.

47
00:03:09,361 --> 00:03:11,305
I'm getting scammed here,
that's the problem.

48
00:03:11,361 --> 00:03:13,547
- Look, I'm sorry.
- What do you think, I'm an idiot?

49
00:03:13,548 --> 00:03:15,482
If you don't want to buy them,
don't buy them.

50
00:03:15,539 --> 00:03:18,414
Those are fake necklaces,
and you're a rip-off artist.

51
00:03:18,549 --> 00:03:19,549
They're real.

52
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:20,982
I call the cops.

53
00:03:21,213 --> 00:03:23,052
You don't want them,
I'll find somebody else.

54
00:03:23,053 --> 00:03:24,166
Hey, let me see those.

55
00:03:26,736 --> 00:03:28,031
My father owns a jewelry store.

56
00:03:28,051 --> 00:03:29,575
I think I can spot a fake.

57
00:03:30,117 --> 00:03:31,152
How much?

58
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:32,860
60 bucks.

59
00:03:32,924 --> 00:03:34,346
I'll take the one on the end.

60
00:03:37,116 --> 00:03:38,175
Whatever.

61
00:03:40,755 --> 00:03:41,794
Thanks.

62
00:03:46,405 --> 00:03:47,736
Can I get my money back?

63
00:03:57,173 --> 00:03:58,173
Why'd you help me?

64
00:03:59,435 --> 00:04:01,711
Just one girl watching
another girl's back, I guess.

65
00:04:02,743 --> 00:04:04,625
Or you're stranded here,

66
00:04:04,804 --> 00:04:07,780
and for some reason, you didn't want
that guy calling the cops.

67
00:04:17,335 --> 00:04:19,599
I'll give you a ride into town.
You buy me a drink.

68
00:04:31,398 --> 00:04:32,478
What?

69
00:04:39,336 --> 00:04:40,391
What are you doing?

70
00:04:42,024 --> 00:04:43,085
Did they capture you?

71
00:04:43,124 --> 00:04:44,210
Yes, but...

72
00:04:45,567 --> 00:04:46,781
Only temporarily.

73
00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:50,847
I came to say good-bye.

74
00:04:53,317 --> 00:04:54,317
Good-bye?

75
00:04:54,441 --> 00:04:55,663
I'm leaving with them.

76
00:04:56,646 --> 00:04:57,693
What the hell is going on?

77
00:04:57,694 --> 00:05:00,195
I mean, what are they doing to you?
Are you brainwashed?

78
00:05:00,201 --> 00:05:01,254
Where did Jack go?

79
00:05:01,273 --> 00:05:02,923
Jack didn't go anywhere, Kate.

80
00:05:03,444 --> 00:05:05,566
He's gonna have
to stay behind, like you.

81
00:05:06,755 --> 00:05:07,921
You can't trust them.

82
00:05:08,442 --> 00:05:10,504
If they told you that
they're gonna take you home,

83
00:05:10,505 --> 00:05:12,699
- they're lying...
- I don't want to go home.

84
00:05:14,695 --> 00:05:17,447
I want you to know,
I made a strong case for you.

85
00:05:17,692 --> 00:05:19,610
I told them
that you were a good person...

86
00:05:19,756 --> 00:05:22,274
reliable, smart, honest.

87
00:05:22,782 --> 00:05:25,233
And then they told me
who you were and what you had done.

88
00:05:27,603 --> 00:05:30,111
Let's just say, forgiveness
isn't one of their strong suits.

89
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:36,320
Good luck.

90
00:05:37,839 --> 00:05:38,964
John, where are you going?

91
00:05:38,983 --> 00:05:39,990
Coming out!

92
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,776
Where is Jack and where is Sayid?

93
00:05:43,777 --> 00:05:45,570
Have you seen Rousseau?

94
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,383
John, please. What's happened to you?

95
00:05:53,776 --> 00:05:54,776
I'm sorry, Kate.

96
00:06:05,535 --> 00:06:14,704
Subtitle: swsub.com

97
00:06:28,181 --> 00:06:29,452
What the hell's wrong with you?

98
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:31,979
Don't look at me,
and pretend we're not talking.

99
00:06:32,805 --> 00:06:34,178
I'm not supposed to be here.

100
00:06:34,179 --> 00:06:35,179
Good. Then scram.

101
00:06:35,431 --> 00:06:37,877
Dude, you need to know
that there's been some chatter.

102
00:06:38,775 --> 00:06:40,627
After Paulo and Nikki and everything,

103
00:06:41,182 --> 00:06:43,866
Well, tomorrow there's gonna be a vote.

104
00:06:44,502 --> 00:06:45,543
A vote for what?

105
00:06:45,582 --> 00:06:47,791
To decide whether or not to banish you.

106
00:06:48,617 --> 00:06:49,617
Banish me?

107
00:06:50,804 --> 00:06:53,060
- Where?
- Well, there was debate about that,

108
00:06:53,118 --> 00:06:56,022
but the consensus was
half a mile down the beach.

109
00:06:56,689 --> 00:06:57,730
Consensus?

110
00:06:58,430 --> 00:07:01,373
I'm only saying this
because there may be a way to fix it--

111
00:07:01,617 --> 00:07:03,424
to, like, make amends.

112
00:07:05,929 --> 00:07:06,929
I don't do amends.

113
00:07:07,869 --> 00:07:09,168
You might want to ask yourself

114
00:07:09,481 --> 00:07:12,987
about all the good stuff that comes
from being
part of this... society.

115
00:07:14,744 --> 00:07:16,581
I mean, you can't even feed yourself.

116
00:07:16,725 --> 00:07:17,918
You use our latrine,

117
00:07:18,689 --> 00:07:21,660
drink the water that Steve brings
every morning to the trough...

118
00:07:21,744 --> 00:07:22,744
What?

119
00:07:22,807 --> 00:07:27,765
You know how for 3 days, 10 h and 15 min
I ain't allowed to use nicknames?

120
00:07:28,553 --> 00:07:34,109
Well, you, sir... Hugo,
are rotund,

121
00:07:34,992 --> 00:07:35,992
annoying,

122
00:07:36,304 --> 00:07:38,081
and you're ruining my damn view.

123
00:07:38,493 --> 00:07:39,602
How's that for amends?

124
00:07:40,931 --> 00:07:42,445
You're making a big mistake, dude.

125
00:07:45,368 --> 00:07:46,368
Banish me...

126
00:09:16,029 --> 00:09:17,727
How about you tell me your name?

127
00:09:19,089 --> 00:09:21,268
- It's Lucy.
- And what's your real name?

128
00:09:22,309 --> 00:09:24,315
Next time somebody asks,
you don't think about it.

129
00:09:24,339 --> 00:09:26,703
- I didn't think--
- Not even for a second.

130
00:09:28,035 --> 00:09:29,404
So why Lucy?

131
00:09:30,152 --> 00:09:31,152
She's a saint.

132
00:09:31,438 --> 00:09:33,329
I had to memorize them all
in Sunday's school,

133
00:09:33,367 --> 00:09:35,775
so I figure they're probably still
rattling around my brain.

134
00:09:35,776 --> 00:09:38,503
What makes a girl who went
to Sunday school scared of cops?

135
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:48,924
A few months ago,
I killed my stepfather.

136
00:09:49,087 --> 00:09:51,518
I escaped from the marshal
who arrested me for it.

137
00:09:55,027 --> 00:09:56,027
Why?

138
00:09:58,728 --> 00:10:00,109
'cause he was a bad guy.

139
00:10:04,026 --> 00:10:05,060
So...

140
00:10:05,833 --> 00:10:07,796
what the hell are you doing in Iowa?

141
00:10:09,401 --> 00:10:10,751
I want to talk to my mother.

142
00:10:15,263 --> 00:10:17,558
You're gonna have
a really hard time doing that,

143
00:10:17,701 --> 00:10:19,732
because if you did
what you just said you did,

144
00:10:20,186 --> 00:10:22,597
the feds are gonna be watching her 24/7.

145
00:10:23,066 --> 00:10:24,096
I'll figure something out.

146
00:10:24,324 --> 00:10:26,822
- Oh, you will, huh?
- What, you want to help me?

147
00:10:33,761 --> 00:10:34,761
Absolutely.

148
00:10:37,074 --> 00:10:38,074
Why?

149
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:45,398
I fell in love with the wrong guy,

150
00:10:46,637 --> 00:10:48,544
and then I gave him my life savings.

151
00:10:50,949 --> 00:10:53,323
He conned me and embarrassed me.

152
00:10:53,932 --> 00:10:55,236
He was a bad guy.

153
00:10:57,636 --> 00:10:58,636
So...

154
00:10:58,886 --> 00:11:02,221
I'll help you get the meeting
with your mom... Lucy,

155
00:11:03,175 --> 00:11:05,471
because one of us
deserves something good.

156
00:12:22,199 --> 00:12:24,087
I ain't gonna get the Korean vote...

157
00:12:37,321 --> 00:12:39,115
Come on, come on!

158
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:05,131
Hey, let's do it!

159
00:13:07,037 --> 00:13:08,037
Do what?

160
00:13:08,975 --> 00:13:11,296
I'm ready to do it: make amends,

161
00:13:11,717 --> 00:13:12,782
change the vote.

162
00:13:14,787 --> 00:13:16,564
I don't wanna be banished, okay?

163
00:13:16,832 --> 00:13:17,848
You happy?

164
00:13:18,787 --> 00:13:19,842
Dude, you stink.

165
00:13:21,037 --> 00:13:22,092
What is that, fish?

166
00:13:24,591 --> 00:13:26,347
Did you try to gut one yourself?

167
00:13:27,974 --> 00:13:29,641
How have you not learned that by now?

168
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:31,815
I mean, we've been here, like,
three months.

169
00:13:32,163 --> 00:13:33,385
Could we just do this?

170
00:13:33,787 --> 00:13:34,787
Do what?

171
00:13:36,537 --> 00:13:37,544
Make nice?

172
00:13:39,351 --> 00:13:41,669
Apologize for calling me
all those names.

173
00:13:45,289 --> 00:13:47,627
I'm really sorry I called you "rotund."

174
00:13:49,312 --> 00:13:51,936
- Really?
- You're worse than a girl.

175
00:13:52,664 --> 00:13:55,211
Come on. Let's spread the love.

176
00:14:28,084 --> 00:14:29,388
What the hell am I doing here?

177
00:14:29,389 --> 00:14:31,178
- Why don't you tell me?
- I don't know.

178
00:14:31,245 --> 00:14:32,261
I don't know either!

179
00:14:32,262 --> 00:14:34,382
So, why don't you let go of my wrist?

180
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:58,505
So what the hell happened?

181
00:15:00,322 --> 00:15:01,885
I was making a cup of tea.

182
00:15:02,826 --> 00:15:04,859
Canister came in through the window.

183
00:15:07,074 --> 00:15:08,742
So what'd you do to piss them off?

184
00:15:11,068 --> 00:15:12,456
You're wasting your time.

185
00:15:13,068 --> 00:15:14,234
The knife is too big.

186
00:15:14,691 --> 00:15:16,380
We need something smaller.
A safety pin...

187
00:15:16,381 --> 00:15:18,825
- We're going back.
- What?

188
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:20,943
They did this to us.
Why would we go back?

189
00:15:21,023 --> 00:15:23,337
You say "they"
like you didn't lock me in a cage

190
00:15:23,414 --> 00:15:25,026
and watch me break rocks all day.

191
00:15:30,254 --> 00:15:32,214
We're going back to your village because

192
00:15:32,819 --> 00:15:35,138
my friends were probably gassed,
just like us.

193
00:15:35,694 --> 00:15:36,824
Your people are gone anyway.

194
00:15:37,254 --> 00:15:39,282
- I saw them all pack up and leave.
- What?

195
00:15:40,007 --> 00:15:41,840
Locke came to me to say good-bye.

196
00:15:42,873 --> 00:15:44,725
They were taking off,
going somewhere else.

197
00:15:44,764 --> 00:15:45,998
Going? Going where?

198
00:15:46,167 --> 00:15:47,942
He didn't exactly tell me.

199
00:15:51,818 --> 00:15:54,869
Welcome to the wonderful world
of not knowing what the hell's going on.

200
00:16:25,512 --> 00:16:26,629
On the ground!

201
00:16:27,318 --> 00:16:29,189
Get down! On the ground!

202
00:16:29,603 --> 00:16:31,166
Let me see those hands!

203
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:34,657
Let me see those hands!

204
00:16:36,557 --> 00:16:38,120
Long time no see, Austen.

205
00:16:45,702 --> 00:16:48,022
- Who the hell are you?
- I'm just selling bibles!

206
00:17:18,925 --> 00:17:20,004
Hi.

207
00:17:22,885 --> 00:17:24,699
They questioned me for half an hour.

208
00:17:25,441 --> 00:17:26,793
He confiscated my case.

209
00:17:27,433 --> 00:17:29,768
He was asking me about
selling bibles and...

210
00:17:30,428 --> 00:17:32,396
It's a good thing I know how to lie.

211
00:17:32,466 --> 00:17:34,492
Yeah, now we know
what we're up against, right?

212
00:17:34,511 --> 00:17:35,628
Yeah, now we know

213
00:17:35,647 --> 00:17:38,697
that there were six guys
waiting to take you down, Lucy

214
00:17:38,829 --> 00:17:40,585
Yeah, it's okay. I'll figure it out.

215
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:43,518
Figure it out? That marshal...

216
00:17:44,256 --> 00:17:45,769
I don't know what you did to him,

217
00:17:45,818 --> 00:17:49,081
but if he ever gets his hands on you,
it is gonna be you or him.

218
00:17:49,158 --> 00:17:50,990
Look, if you've changed your mind,

219
00:17:51,128 --> 00:17:53,062
if you don't wanna help me, I get it.

220
00:17:53,105 --> 00:17:54,253
No, I do wanna help you,

221
00:17:54,254 --> 00:17:56,839
but if I'm lying to federal agents,
Lucy,

222
00:17:56,879 --> 00:17:59,066
so that you can have
a chat with your mom...

223
00:18:00,059 --> 00:18:02,899
then I at least need to know
that there's a pretty good reason.

224
00:18:06,968 --> 00:18:07,981
He...

225
00:18:08,528 --> 00:18:09,978
He... used to get drunk

226
00:18:10,624 --> 00:18:13,827
and beat up my mom,
so I blew up his house.

227
00:18:14,817 --> 00:18:15,817
I...

228
00:18:16,754 --> 00:18:18,353
Made it look like an accident...

229
00:18:19,877 --> 00:18:21,054
a gas leak.

230
00:18:22,629 --> 00:18:25,073
Took out an insurance policy
on the house...

231
00:18:25,691 --> 00:18:26,691
for her.

232
00:18:27,818 --> 00:18:28,929
Set her up for life.

233
00:18:32,879 --> 00:18:34,432
And then she gave me up.

234
00:18:37,445 --> 00:18:38,504
Chose him over me.

235
00:18:41,934 --> 00:18:43,883
So the reason
I need to talk to her is...

236
00:18:45,156 --> 00:18:46,603
someone I love...

237
00:18:47,191 --> 00:18:50,914
Someone who's supposed
to care about me betrayed me,

238
00:18:52,255 --> 00:18:53,571
and I wanna know why.

239
00:18:57,129 --> 00:18:58,129
Well...

240
00:18:59,318 --> 00:19:00,595
then let's go find out.

241
00:19:06,577 --> 00:19:07,684
What are you doing?

242
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:10,468
Whoever dragged us out here
left a trail.

243
00:19:10,469 --> 00:19:12,219
It'll lead us back to where
we came from.

244
00:19:12,335 --> 00:19:13,435
Let's go.

245
00:19:14,276 --> 00:19:15,492
It's gonna rain.

246
00:19:15,558 --> 00:19:17,449
Don't you think
we should wait till morning?

247
00:19:29,412 --> 00:19:30,412
Why?

248
00:19:30,724 --> 00:19:31,724
Why what?

249
00:19:32,038 --> 00:19:33,602
Why would they handcuff you to me

250
00:19:33,603 --> 00:19:35,823
and then drag us all the way
out into the jungle?

251
00:19:36,039 --> 00:19:37,761
Ben has a thing for mind games.

252
00:19:39,562 --> 00:19:41,280
Is that why he left you behind?

253
00:19:41,538 --> 00:19:42,982
Do we really have to talk?

254
00:19:44,165 --> 00:19:45,165
Nope.

255
00:19:52,610 --> 00:19:54,790
Come on.
If the trail gets wet, I'll lose it.

256
00:19:54,868 --> 00:19:58,379
I hope you're not dragging me
all the way back there with you for him.

257
00:19:59,975 --> 00:20:03,016
- Excuse me?
- I hope you're not going back for Jack,

258
00:20:04,227 --> 00:20:06,483
because I was standing right there

259
00:20:06,789 --> 00:20:09,238
when he told you not to come back,

260
00:20:09,495 --> 00:20:12,659
and now that you've ruined his
chance to get off the island...

261
00:20:26,318 --> 00:20:27,474
You done?

262
00:20:29,038 --> 00:20:30,479
I said, are you done?

263
00:20:36,438 --> 00:20:38,656
I... I'm sorry. I didn't mean to...

264
00:20:43,306 --> 00:20:44,762
What the hell was that?

265
00:20:55,174 --> 00:20:57,654
- Get up!
- You dislocated my shoulder!

266
00:20:59,532 --> 00:21:00,532
Come on!

267
00:21:07,857 --> 00:21:09,054
Wait! Come here.

268
00:21:12,208 --> 00:21:14,484
Okay. Get down.

269
00:21:15,546 --> 00:21:16,684
What the hell...

270
00:22:05,289 --> 00:22:06,406
Are we safe?

271
00:22:07,374 --> 00:22:08,454
You tell me.

272
00:22:21,181 --> 00:22:22,894
I ain't kissing no damn baby.

273
00:22:22,968 --> 00:22:24,724
Claire's, like, really influential.

274
00:22:24,778 --> 00:22:26,904
If she votes for you to stay,
you're home free, dude.

275
00:22:26,905 --> 00:22:28,548
Why wouldn't she vote for me?

276
00:22:28,843 --> 00:22:30,842
It's not like I ever done
anything bad to her.

277
00:22:30,843 --> 00:22:33,599
Nah, but you never did
anything good for her either.

278
00:22:34,030 --> 00:22:36,161
And have you ever
even asked how Aaron is?

279
00:22:36,906 --> 00:22:38,465
I know how he is.

280
00:22:39,449 --> 00:22:40,853
He cries loud, and he smells.

281
00:22:40,948 --> 00:22:42,718
You see? That's what I'm talking about.

282
00:22:42,757 --> 00:22:44,435
You're sarcastic.
People don't like that.

283
00:22:44,470 --> 00:22:45,479
All right.

284
00:22:46,231 --> 00:22:47,391
So I go over...

285
00:22:48,530 --> 00:22:49,589
And do what?

286
00:22:50,657 --> 00:22:53,071
Moms love it when you show
an interest in their babies.

287
00:22:54,054 --> 00:22:57,758
So go over there,
say something nice, call her "Claire".

288
00:22:58,532 --> 00:22:59,532
And give her this.

289
00:23:00,967 --> 00:23:02,467
I know you can do it, dude.

290
00:23:08,528 --> 00:23:09,666
Hey, Claire.

291
00:23:13,344 --> 00:23:15,447
Hey there... little baby...

292
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:18,029
Aaron.

293
00:23:21,327 --> 00:23:23,735
Is there anything I can do for you?

294
00:23:23,849 --> 00:23:25,576
No. I just came by...

295
00:23:26,132 --> 00:23:27,389
to see your baby.

296
00:23:32,202 --> 00:23:34,740
He's not as wrinkly
as he was a couple weeks ago.

297
00:23:40,958 --> 00:23:43,929
Yeah, I... guess he's not. Thanks.

298
00:23:45,956 --> 00:23:47,827
Oh, and... this is for you.

299
00:23:49,861 --> 00:23:51,490
- Thank you.
- I don't like...

300
00:23:53,535 --> 00:23:54,673
blankets.

301
00:23:56,695 --> 00:23:57,814
Well, good night.

302
00:23:58,264 --> 00:23:59,264
Good night.

303
00:24:10,152 --> 00:24:11,521
Do you think it's gone?

304
00:24:12,014 --> 00:24:14,688
- Are we safe?
- Are you serious?

305
00:24:14,993 --> 00:24:16,633
- What?
- You've never seen that?

306
00:24:16,672 --> 00:24:17,706
If you don't believe me,

307
00:24:17,764 --> 00:24:20,202
you can always pull
my other shoulder out of its socket.

308
00:24:21,584 --> 00:24:24,343
- I was... I wasn't trying to...
- Don't flatter yourself.

309
00:24:24,439 --> 00:24:26,773
This is the fourth time
it's been dislocated.

310
00:24:39,682 --> 00:24:40,917
Give me your hand.

311
00:24:42,078 --> 00:24:44,015
- Why?
- 'cause I want you to pop it back in.

312
00:24:44,016 --> 00:24:45,580
- No, I'm not gonna--
- You're gonna.

313
00:24:45,888 --> 00:24:47,104
Right, now it feels

314
00:24:47,393 --> 00:24:51,464
like there's broken glass under my skin,
and if it weren't for you,

315
00:24:52,446 --> 00:24:54,515
I would be on my way home right now.

316
00:24:54,516 --> 00:24:56,664
Jack told me
not to come back to protect me,

317
00:24:57,076 --> 00:24:59,187
because he didn't want me to get hurt.

318
00:25:01,516 --> 00:25:03,845
- Is that what you think?
- Yeah, that's what I think.

319
00:25:05,331 --> 00:25:08,052
We have cameras on the cages, Kate...

320
00:25:09,826 --> 00:25:10,826
all of them.

321
00:25:12,075 --> 00:25:13,075
He saw you...

322
00:25:13,715 --> 00:25:15,702
you and Sawyer.

323
00:25:17,325 --> 00:25:20,469
The reason Jack told you
not to come back

324
00:25:21,450 --> 00:25:24,247
wasn't because
he didn't want you to get hurt.

325
00:25:25,819 --> 00:25:28,713
It was because you broke his heart.

326
00:25:31,952 --> 00:25:32,952
So...

327
00:25:34,133 --> 00:25:35,408
grab my wrist,

328
00:25:35,599 --> 00:25:37,586
push up and twist.

329
00:25:58,193 --> 00:26:00,219
Why do we gotta be out here
so damn early?

330
00:26:00,351 --> 00:26:02,429
You asked me to help you
catch a boar.

331
00:26:03,537 --> 00:26:05,925
Well, this is when they break
cover to eat.

332
00:26:07,662 --> 00:26:09,784
Looks like they picked
a day to sleep in.

333
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:11,641
So what's your angle, brother?

334
00:26:12,599 --> 00:26:14,259
- My angle?
- Well, you...

335
00:26:15,114 --> 00:26:17,046
Haven't spoken three words to me,
and then...

336
00:26:18,003 --> 00:26:19,855
suddenly you want to be
my hunting partner.

337
00:26:21,287 --> 00:26:22,287
My angle...

338
00:26:23,287 --> 00:26:25,618
is I got hearts and minds to change,

339
00:26:26,162 --> 00:26:28,390
and politics is all about bribes.

340
00:26:30,598 --> 00:26:33,074
Since money don't mean
squat on this island,

341
00:26:34,349 --> 00:26:36,726
I gotta give the people
something they like...

342
00:26:38,097 --> 00:26:39,668
And people like meat.

343
00:27:03,475 --> 00:27:04,586
How's your shoulder?

344
00:27:06,724 --> 00:27:08,765
- Awesome.
- Then let's get going.

345
00:27:20,599 --> 00:27:21,599
Thank you.

346
00:27:22,601 --> 00:27:24,101
You're welcome, sweetheart.

347
00:27:41,542 --> 00:27:44,265
Oh, my god! I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

348
00:27:44,289 --> 00:27:46,048
- No worries.
- I'm such an idiot.

349
00:27:46,194 --> 00:27:48,104
It happens all the time, sweetheart.

350
00:27:49,481 --> 00:27:50,598
Thank you.

351
00:28:11,723 --> 00:28:12,723
Hi, mom.

352
00:28:15,537 --> 00:28:17,223
What are you doing here, Katherine?

353
00:28:21,036 --> 00:28:22,036
You look good.

354
00:28:23,676 --> 00:28:25,335
I asked you what you were doing here.

355
00:28:31,038 --> 00:28:33,764
I want to know why you
told them what I did to Wayne.

356
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:41,122
I thought maybe you came because
you wanted to say you were sorry.

357
00:28:42,638 --> 00:28:44,008
I'm not sorry.

358
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:49,183
He hit you.
He treated you like a dog and you...

359
00:28:49,250 --> 00:28:51,452
You can't help who you love, Katherine.

360
00:28:52,287 --> 00:28:55,152
And for good or bad, I loved him.

361
00:28:56,786 --> 00:28:58,417
And you burnt him alive.

362
00:28:59,287 --> 00:29:01,675
You turned on the gas,
and you lit a match.

363
00:29:02,099 --> 00:29:04,523
You murdered him in cold blood.

364
00:29:07,164 --> 00:29:08,164
I did it for you.

365
00:29:10,821 --> 00:29:12,809
What you did, you did for yourself.

366
00:29:17,527 --> 00:29:18,954
I have to go back to work.

367
00:29:22,115 --> 00:29:23,670
Because you are my daughter,

368
00:29:24,553 --> 00:29:26,679
I'm not gonna tell the two men
sitting at the table

369
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:29,704
who've been following me
for the last month that you are here,

370
00:29:30,586 --> 00:29:32,264
but I swear to god, Katie...

371
00:29:33,446 --> 00:29:34,777
if I ever see you again,

372
00:29:36,741 --> 00:29:38,996
the first thing I will do
is yell for help.

373
00:29:43,561 --> 00:29:44,678
Good-bye.

374
00:30:00,727 --> 00:30:02,080
Did he say that to you?

375
00:30:02,552 --> 00:30:03,552
Sorry?

376
00:30:04,141 --> 00:30:05,455
That I broke his heart.

377
00:30:07,183 --> 00:30:08,242
He didn't have to.

378
00:30:12,867 --> 00:30:14,372
You don't know anything about him.

379
00:30:14,489 --> 00:30:15,766
I know where he was born.

380
00:30:15,978 --> 00:30:17,678
I know what his parents
did for a living.

381
00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:21,543
I know that he was married
and who he was married to.

382
00:30:21,990 --> 00:30:25,185
I know why he got a divorce.
I know how his father died.

383
00:30:26,114 --> 00:30:29,820
I know his height, his weight,
his birthday and his blood type.

384
00:30:32,802 --> 00:30:34,524
What do you know about him, Kate?

385
00:30:40,978 --> 00:30:42,115
Let's go.

386
00:30:50,117 --> 00:30:51,117
Run.

387
00:30:51,177 --> 00:30:52,314
Run!

388
00:31:08,971 --> 00:31:10,649
Get up! Get up!

389
00:31:11,468 --> 00:31:12,780
Run! Run! Come on!

390
00:31:15,532 --> 00:31:16,568
What are you doing?

391
00:31:16,569 --> 00:31:18,658
I know what happens
when you set those things off!

392
00:31:18,677 --> 00:31:20,013
We will go alongside them.

393
00:31:20,109 --> 00:31:22,386
We don't need to!
We can go around there-- off!

394
00:31:23,742 --> 00:31:24,742
Damn it!

395
00:31:35,329 --> 00:31:36,736
You're gonna want to be over here.

396
00:31:39,316 --> 00:31:40,453
Kate, come on!

397
00:32:22,331 --> 00:32:26,079
We don't know what it is, but we know
that it doesn't like our fences.

398
00:32:26,195 --> 00:32:27,468
You had a key!

399
00:32:29,389 --> 00:32:32,225
They left me behind, too.
They gassed me.

400
00:32:32,329 --> 00:32:33,562
I know that you don't care,

401
00:32:33,639 --> 00:32:36,737
but the people I spent
the last three years of my life with

402
00:32:36,827 --> 00:32:38,118
they just left me!

403
00:32:42,528 --> 00:32:43,919
I thought that maybe...

404
00:32:45,389 --> 00:32:48,384
Maybe if I could make you think
that we were in it together...

405
00:32:51,766 --> 00:32:53,717
Maybe I wouldn't get left behind again.

406
00:33:30,951 --> 00:33:32,028
It's delicious!

407
00:33:32,407 --> 00:33:34,673
Just a little Dharma A1 and paprika...

408
00:33:37,459 --> 00:33:39,334
I hope you'll remember
this little barbecue

409
00:33:39,335 --> 00:33:41,185
- at your meeting later.
- Oh, what meeting?

410
00:33:43,897 --> 00:33:45,563
Hurley told me about the vote.

411
00:33:45,648 --> 00:33:48,364
Vote? Since when
did anyone around here vote?

412
00:33:59,845 --> 00:34:00,952
You son of a bitch!

413
00:34:01,972 --> 00:34:03,719
There wasn't ever gonna be no vote.

414
00:34:03,847 --> 00:34:04,847
But...

415
00:34:05,667 --> 00:34:06,924
Wasn't it nice...

416
00:34:07,663 --> 00:34:08,770
Being nice?

417
00:34:08,852 --> 00:34:10,682
You tricked me into being decent?

418
00:34:11,034 --> 00:34:13,363
That's gotta be the lamest con
in the history of cons!

419
00:34:13,421 --> 00:34:14,714
It wasn't a con, dude.

420
00:34:14,849 --> 00:34:17,971
If you're gonna be our temporary leader,
you need to do some damage control.

421
00:34:17,972 --> 00:34:19,031
Leader?

422
00:34:19,483 --> 00:34:20,712
What the hell are you smoking?

423
00:34:20,750 --> 00:34:24,393
Jack's gone. Locke's gone.
Kate and Sayid...

424
00:34:26,534 --> 00:34:27,534
You're all we got.

425
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:29,649
When Paulo and Nikki died,

426
00:34:30,205 --> 00:34:31,489
we all looked to you.

427
00:34:31,804 --> 00:34:33,970
Then again, you totally tried
to steal their diamonds,

428
00:34:33,989 --> 00:34:35,493
but we wanted to look to you.

429
00:34:35,973 --> 00:34:36,980
Look around.

430
00:34:38,336 --> 00:34:39,498
You made everyone happy.

431
00:34:41,778 --> 00:34:42,874
Just for today,

432
00:34:43,530 --> 00:34:44,709
they can eat boar,

433
00:34:44,902 --> 00:34:47,457
laugh and forget
that they're totally screwed.

434
00:34:49,215 --> 00:34:51,573
And you did that for them, dude... You.

435
00:34:54,789 --> 00:34:56,498
And what if I don't want
to be the leader?

436
00:34:57,998 --> 00:35:00,031
Yeah, well, I don't think
Jack wanted to, either.

437
00:35:02,841 --> 00:35:03,952
Sucks for you, dude.

438
00:36:37,208 --> 00:36:39,577
Sayid's in one of those backyards
down there.

439
00:36:40,019 --> 00:36:41,062
I'll go get him.

440
00:36:42,305 --> 00:36:43,472
You should get Jack.

441
00:37:02,711 --> 00:37:04,197
Jack, wake up. It's me.

442
00:37:13,583 --> 00:37:14,583
What happened?

443
00:37:16,084 --> 00:37:17,084
They all left.

444
00:37:18,908 --> 00:37:20,181
All left?

445
00:37:27,172 --> 00:37:29,146
- What?
- Because of me.

446
00:37:31,458 --> 00:37:32,458
I'm so sorry.

447
00:37:34,430 --> 00:37:36,076
I should've listened to you.

448
00:37:36,209 --> 00:37:37,209
I never...

449
00:37:44,005 --> 00:37:46,005
I wanted to come back to help you...

450
00:37:47,757 --> 00:37:49,201
but you didn't need me to.

451
00:37:54,381 --> 00:37:56,246
And now because of me, you can't go...

452
00:38:10,243 --> 00:38:11,380
I'm so sorry.

453
00:38:20,817 --> 00:38:21,817
They just...

454
00:38:23,713 --> 00:38:24,832
Left?

455
00:38:30,436 --> 00:38:32,017
Even Juliet?

456
00:38:39,269 --> 00:38:40,479
No, they left her, too.

457
00:38:44,587 --> 00:38:45,592
Why?

458
00:38:50,095 --> 00:38:51,931
You know her better than I do.

459
00:38:58,950 --> 00:38:59,950
Now what?

460
00:39:05,516 --> 00:39:06,516
Now...

461
00:39:10,388 --> 00:39:11,388
Now we go back.

462
00:39:46,465 --> 00:39:48,951
- Thanks for everything, Cassidy.
- You got it.

463
00:39:52,889 --> 00:39:54,931
So... this guy who ripped you off...

464
00:39:56,325 --> 00:39:59,027
You wanna give me his name,
tell me where I can find him?

465
00:40:00,631 --> 00:40:02,528
You almost got arrested for me, Cassidy.

466
00:40:02,585 --> 00:40:03,666
I wanna help you.

467
00:40:06,466 --> 00:40:07,546
I'm pregnant.

468
00:40:11,389 --> 00:40:13,502
It's his. The baby's his,

469
00:40:14,705 --> 00:40:15,710
and I still love him.

470
00:40:16,326 --> 00:40:18,684
So call the cops. Have him locked up.

471
00:40:18,766 --> 00:40:21,406
Will you ever forgive your mom
for calling the cops?

472
00:40:24,890 --> 00:40:25,890
No, I won't.

473
00:40:35,891 --> 00:40:36,933
Thanks, Lucy.

474
00:40:38,514 --> 00:40:39,514
My name's Kate.

475
00:40:59,762 --> 00:41:00,762
You okay?

476
00:41:01,513 --> 00:41:03,151
Yeah. You?

477
00:41:20,765 --> 00:41:23,346
I've checked all the houses.
Everyone's gone.

478
00:41:24,551 --> 00:41:25,832
No weapons, no trail.

479
00:41:27,236 --> 00:41:29,516
It's like 50 people
disappeared into thin air.

480
00:41:31,050 --> 00:41:32,549
We should take what we can find

481
00:41:33,034 --> 00:41:34,661
and head out while we still got light.

482
00:41:39,613 --> 00:41:41,057
She is not coming with us.

483
00:41:44,798 --> 00:41:45,798
Yes, she is.

484
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:47,800
Why?

485
00:41:52,430 --> 00:41:54,379
Because they left her behind, too.
