1
00:00:00,288 --> 00:00:01,009
Previously on "Lost"...

2
00:00:01,039 --> 00:00:03,225
Charlie, just give me the baby.

3
00:00:03,272 --> 00:00:04,979
Who the hell are you, John?!

4
00:00:05,211 --> 00:00:07,491
Aaron's not
your responsibility!

5
00:00:07,613 --> 00:00:09,263
Where were you
when he was born?!

6
00:00:09,349 --> 00:00:11,343
Where were you when
he was taken?!

7
00:00:11,436 --> 00:00:14,338
You're not his father.
You're not his family!

8
00:00:14,991 --> 00:00:17,272
Neither are you, Charlie.

9
00:00:20,448 --> 00:00:21,107
I'm sorry!

10
00:00:27,035 --> 00:00:29,029
This is not your island.

11
00:00:29,581 --> 00:00:31,677
This is our island,

12
00:00:32,005 --> 00:00:34,146
and the only reason
you're livin' on it

13
00:00:34,563 --> 00:00:36,935
is 'cause we let
you live on it.

14
00:00:38,619 --> 00:00:41,903
Right here, there's a line.

15
00:00:42,416 --> 00:00:44,248
You cross that line,

16
00:00:44,433 --> 00:00:48,623
we go from a misunderstanding
to something else.

17
00:00:49,914 --> 00:00:52,051
It's your call, Jack.

18
00:00:52,564 --> 00:00:54,368
Sayid tells me
that you're a cop.

19
00:00:54,461 --> 00:00:55,644
I was a cop.

20
00:00:57,046 --> 00:00:58,896
Can I ask you something?

21
00:00:59,036 --> 00:00:59,885
Shoot.

22
00:01:02,781 --> 00:01:06,159
How long do you think it
would take to train an army?

23
00:01:23,591 --> 00:01:26,969
- Is that all of them?
- All six of 'em. Just, uh,

24
00:01:28,605 --> 00:01:30,313
one box of ammo.

25
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,463
At least we don't have to worry
about running out anytime soon.

26
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:40,046
Jack, I'm grateful that you decided
to keep them all in the same place.

27
00:01:42,849 --> 00:01:46,990
Oh, I had to take them from Charlie--
his heroin stash.

28
00:01:48,345 --> 00:01:51,770
I figured it might have therapeutic
value, if it ever came to that.

29
00:01:51,912 --> 00:01:54,212
You're just gonna leave
it all in the statues?

30
00:01:54,379 --> 00:01:57,087
You want to break seven Virgin Marys?
Be my guest.

31
00:01:57,228 --> 00:01:58,267
I'm superstitious.

32
00:01:59,295 --> 00:01:59,953
John?

33
00:02:02,132 --> 00:02:03,789
The combination.

34
00:02:08,975 --> 00:02:12,322
I'm gonna go ahead and assume that
you're asking me because you're
worried that

35
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:15,349
I might fall off a
cliff or something,

36
00:02:15,445 --> 00:02:17,197
that it would be irresponsible

37
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:19,690
for just one of us to
have access to this room,

38
00:02:19,709 --> 00:02:23,233
rather than this being
an issue of trust.

39
00:02:24,166 --> 00:02:27,782
Well, there are a lot of
cliffs on this island, John.

40
00:02:32,689 --> 00:02:35,876
All right,
but I think we should agree, Jack,

41
00:02:36,019 --> 00:02:39,728
that if either of us need to open this
door, we consult each other first.

42
00:02:40,007 --> 00:02:40,760
Absolutely.

43
00:02:41,742 --> 00:02:45,746
Right 7, left 33, right 18.
You need to write it down?

44
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:48,113
- Nope. I got it.
- All right.

45
00:02:49,888 --> 00:02:53,887
And, Jack, you may want to consider
locking the medicine in here, too.

46
00:02:54,637 --> 00:02:57,057
Why would I need to do that?

47
00:02:57,712 --> 00:03:04,669
Well, well... now look who had
to relocate to the suburbs.

48
00:03:10,135 --> 00:03:12,179
Ain't that just like a woman?

49
00:03:13,017 --> 00:03:14,677
She keeps the house.

50
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:17,184
You get the
cheap-ass apartment.

51
00:03:18,726 --> 00:03:22,532
Man, I thought these people hated me,
but I gotta hand it to you--

52
00:03:22,717 --> 00:03:25,668
stealin' a baby,
tryin' to drown it?

53
00:03:25,833 --> 00:03:28,113
Now that's a new low.

54
00:03:28,253 --> 00:03:30,678
Even made Locke
take a swing at ya.

55
00:03:30,865 --> 00:03:34,432
Hell, that's like gettin'
Gandhi to beat his kids.

56
00:03:34,711 --> 00:03:38,852
Shouldn't you be more worried about
Jack ransacking your tent right now?

57
00:03:39,037 --> 00:03:39,557
What?

58
00:03:48,703 --> 00:03:50,703
What the hell do you
think you're doin'?

59
00:03:51,948 --> 00:03:54,849
- You stole these from the hatch.
- You stole them from me.

60
00:03:54,988 --> 00:03:55,411
What?

61
00:03:55,551 --> 00:03:58,465
They were in my stash when I left.
I just took back what was mine.

62
00:03:58,495 --> 00:04:00,895
These belong to all of us,
Sawyer, to the group.

63
00:04:01,617 --> 00:04:03,167
You don't have a stash anymore.

64
00:04:03,273 --> 00:04:06,221
Seriously, doc,
you don't want to do this.

65
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:10,547
Just give me the pills.
We'll forget it ever happened.

66
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,528
Are you threatening me?

67
00:04:13,994 --> 00:04:15,845
Last chance, doc.

68
00:04:54,865 --> 00:04:57,906
What do you want right now?

69
00:04:59,447 --> 00:05:00,439
Just you.

70
00:05:11,233 --> 00:05:14,324
- Oh, damn it.
- What is it?

71
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:18,748
Uh, gonna be late for that
meeting I told you about.

72
00:05:19,261 --> 00:05:21,636
- A meeting, huh?
- Yeah.

73
00:05:21,776 --> 00:05:24,439
You got another date,
you can just say so.

74
00:05:24,577 --> 00:05:27,574
I can only wrap my mind
around one woman at a time.

75
00:05:29,628 --> 00:05:31,766
but I appreciate
the permission.

76
00:05:32,233 --> 00:05:34,180
Back in a flash, gorgeous.

77
00:05:39,925 --> 00:05:42,922
You weren't exactly
supposed to see that.

78
00:05:43,949 --> 00:05:45,877
Are you serious?

79
00:05:47,184 --> 00:05:49,274
- What?
- You're not serious.

80
00:05:50,628 --> 00:05:55,152
You just happen to have
a suitcase full of cash,

81
00:05:55,250 --> 00:06:00,340
and you go to pick it up,
and then the lock just happens to break?

82
00:06:01,134 --> 00:06:04,924
- Give me that.
- It's not even real.

83
00:06:06,792 --> 00:06:08,147
Newspaper?

84
00:06:11,137 --> 00:06:13,608
Are you trying to con me?

85
00:06:13,747 --> 00:06:15,980
What, I ask you what
all the money's for,

86
00:06:16,072 --> 00:06:20,358
and you do some song and dance about
an investment or something and then--

87
00:06:20,497 --> 00:06:23,499
and then I say, "hey,
yo, I've got some money."

88
00:06:23,959 --> 00:06:29,534
Look, you got me. Good for you.

89
00:06:30,848 --> 00:06:32,836
No harm, no foul.

90
00:06:33,116 --> 00:06:35,347
You should have
done your homework.

91
00:06:35,954 --> 00:06:39,336
I didn't take anything
from him in the divorce.

92
00:06:41,761 --> 00:06:44,482
I'm not even worth
your trouble.

93
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:51,085
Well,  shame on me.

94
00:06:53,791 --> 00:06:55,841
I want you to show
me what you do.

95
00:07:00,037 --> 00:07:04,226
Show me what you do,
what you really do.

96
00:07:04,458 --> 00:07:06,219
And what do I do?

97
00:07:07,848 --> 00:07:11,608
Show me how to con
people, Sawyer.

98
00:07:18,336 --> 00:07:20,570
I like what you've
done with the place.

99
00:07:22,484 --> 00:07:24,719
The maid's day off.

100
00:07:26,026 --> 00:07:27,732
You want to move?

101
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:32,577
I heard Jack took
your painkillers.

102
00:07:32,763 --> 00:07:35,213
Yeah, well,
guess me and the doc are on the outs.

103
00:07:35,559 --> 00:07:38,177
One less Christmas card I'll
have to send this year.

104
00:07:38,453 --> 00:07:41,450
Maybe that'll cheer you up.
It's from the hatch.

105
00:07:41,589 --> 00:07:43,939
I know you're hard up
for new reading material.

106
00:07:44,008 --> 00:07:47,251
Well, as much as I'd like to
learn to feather my hair...

107
00:07:48,784 --> 00:07:51,732
I lost my damn
glasses on the raft.

108
00:07:54,722 --> 00:07:56,383
You want to read it to me?

109
00:07:57,269 --> 00:07:59,408
What, you got an
appointment or something?

110
00:08:06,351 --> 00:08:10,732
All right, "ten ways to tell
if he's a sensitive man."

111
00:08:10,825 --> 00:08:12,437
- This oughta be good.
- Mornin'.

112
00:08:12,623 --> 00:08:13,901
Hey, John.

113
00:08:16,937 --> 00:08:18,837
Now there's a sensitive man.

114
00:08:19,816 --> 00:08:21,715
Claire asked him to
sleep down here.

115
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:24,611
Come on.
Locke's got himself needs...

116
00:08:25,871 --> 00:08:28,201
just like anyone else.

117
00:08:29,507 --> 00:08:31,293
Not  everyone is
like you, Sawyer.

118
00:08:31,945 --> 00:08:38,283
Guess that's why el Jacko and Ana Lulu
ain't asked me to join their revolution.

119
00:08:39,638 --> 00:08:42,157
What, you didn't hear
about their little army?

120
00:08:45,239 --> 00:08:49,192
Guess I'm not the only one
on the outs with the doc.

121
00:09:00,312 --> 00:09:01,127
Hey, man.

122
00:09:02,288 --> 00:09:05,471
You gonna "put the lime in the coconut,
drink 'em both up"?

123
00:09:08,553 --> 00:09:09,928
"Lime in the coconut"?

124
00:09:11,373 --> 00:09:12,317
The song?

125
00:09:13,769 --> 00:09:15,475
What do you want, Hurley?

126
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:18,578
So I'm over at Rose
and Bernard's tent.

127
00:09:18,772 --> 00:09:20,805
Did you know he's a dentist?

128
00:09:22,065 --> 00:09:25,013
Well, that's not all he's
been holding out on us.

129
00:09:25,152 --> 00:09:27,969
The guy picked up Boone's signal
from the norwegian plane...

130
00:09:27,999 --> 00:09:28,713
Nigerian.

131
00:09:29,371 --> 00:09:33,645
Right. Anyhow,
he picked it up with this.

132
00:09:36,779 --> 00:09:41,106
That is a shortwave radio.
It's a glorified walkie-talkie.

133
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:45,160
Yeah, but can't you switch the blue wire
with the red wire, make it stronger?

134
00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:48,759
We tried to send a signal with the
plane's transceiver, and all we got

135
00:09:48,898 --> 00:09:52,896
was the french woman's message
on a loop. Why would I bother?

136
00:09:53,130 --> 00:09:54,886
Come on, man,
I mean, it's worth--

137
00:09:55,026 --> 00:09:58,367
It's worth nothing.
It's a waste of time.

138
00:10:00,365 --> 00:10:02,645
Just trying to
cheer you up, dude.

139
00:10:02,799 --> 00:10:04,683
I don't need cheering up.

140
00:10:05,802 --> 00:10:09,564
Okay, man, sorry. No problem.

141
00:10:20,919 --> 00:10:21,676
Hey...

142
00:10:24,988 --> 00:10:25,657
Hey.

143
00:10:26,842 --> 00:10:27,500
Hey.

144
00:10:27,921 --> 00:10:29,157
You  get the combo?

145
00:10:30,985 --> 00:10:31,636
Nice.

146
00:10:32,753 --> 00:10:36,125
Didn't think it'd be that easy
convincing your pal to give it up.

147
00:10:37,495 --> 00:10:40,004
That's the nice thing
about you people--

148
00:10:40,235 --> 00:10:42,081
you're not scared enough.

149
00:10:43,422 --> 00:10:44,730
"Not scared enough"?

150
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:48,249
The same reason we can't talk
anyone into joining the army.

151
00:10:48,389 --> 00:10:52,013
Everyone around here actually
thinks they're safe.

152
00:10:54,014 --> 00:10:57,536
Trust me, Ana,
no one thinks we're safe.

153
00:11:00,339 --> 00:11:02,190
So, Jack...

154
00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:05,253
what's the combo?

155
00:11:09,131 --> 00:11:11,317
I was just kidding.

156
00:11:53,441 --> 00:11:55,333
Oh. Vincent.

157
00:11:56,475 --> 00:11:58,146
What are you doing out here?

158
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:24,452
Oh, man!
It's really comin' down!

159
00:12:24,554 --> 00:12:27,085
- Get under here, Freckles!
- I like the rain!

160
00:12:27,158 --> 00:12:29,773
Yeah, me, too, from under here.

161
00:12:32,062 --> 00:12:34,009
- What the hell?
- That's Sun.

162
00:12:54,618 --> 00:12:57,042
- She all right?
- She's breathing.

163
00:12:57,182 --> 00:12:58,365
Go get Jack.

164
00:12:58,693 --> 00:13:00,188
- Go get Jack!
- Okay.

165
00:13:06,358 --> 00:13:08,321
- What happened?
- Where's Jack?

166
00:13:14,145 --> 00:13:15,681
Was she conscious at all?

167
00:13:15,754 --> 00:13:17,905
- Did she say anything?
- Nothin', not a word.

168
00:13:17,935 --> 00:13:21,601
She's okay. She's okay.
She's gonna be all right.

169
00:13:21,694 --> 00:13:24,444
You need to let me take care of her,
all right? Please.

170
00:13:24,544 --> 00:13:25,332
How did you find her?

171
00:13:25,472 --> 00:13:29,005
I heard her scream, found her out in the
jungle about a half a klick from here.

172
00:13:29,035 --> 00:13:31,135
She was out cold,
and her hands were tied.

173
00:13:31,168 --> 00:13:33,068
What do you mean,
her hands were tied?

174
00:13:34,888 --> 00:13:36,742
They're back.

175
00:13:43,608 --> 00:13:45,558
They told us they
would leave us alone.

176
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:47,750
Well, John,
it looks like they broke their promise.

177
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:49,555
We don't even know
what happened.

178
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:51,288
Do we need to know?

179
00:13:54,065 --> 00:13:56,661
- Where'd you find her?
- Just outside her garden.

180
00:13:56,799 --> 00:13:59,509
We should take a look
around with guns.

181
00:13:59,649 --> 00:14:00,739
No.

182
00:14:02,529 --> 00:14:03,360
"No"?

183
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:07,200
We arm up, we're just as likely to
shoot each other as we are one of them.

184
00:14:09,688 --> 00:14:10,775
Okay.

185
00:14:11,101 --> 00:14:14,101
We'll wait for Sun to wake up.
She'll tell us what happened.

186
00:14:15,449 --> 00:14:17,968
Then we're gonna do
something about it.

187
00:14:19,017 --> 00:14:21,345
Sounds like a plan.

188
00:14:31,231 --> 00:14:33,416
They usually don't
leave any trail.

189
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:35,164
It's worth a look.

190
00:14:37,518 --> 00:14:38,969
Let me ask you something.

191
00:14:39,876 --> 00:14:42,433
This whole scenario
make sense to you?

192
00:14:42,890 --> 00:14:44,121
What do you mean?

193
00:14:44,914 --> 00:14:48,484
Well, think about it.
First off, how'd she get away?

194
00:14:48,627 --> 00:14:50,917
Woman doesn't weigh a
hundred pounds soakin' wet.

195
00:14:50,947 --> 00:14:53,829
She was fightin' for her life.
People are capable of almost--

196
00:14:53,859 --> 00:14:55,315
You couldn't get away...

197
00:14:55,688 --> 00:15:01,092
and you versus Sun, hot-oil death match,
my money's on you, Sheena.

198
00:15:01,210 --> 00:15:02,960
Thanks for your
vote of confidence.

199
00:15:12,913 --> 00:15:16,448
It's a hood,
just like the one they put over my head.

200
00:15:17,338 --> 00:15:19,366
No, it's not.

201
00:15:19,830 --> 00:15:22,254
This one's black,
different weave.

202
00:15:23,421 --> 00:15:27,490
It's all in the details...
and they're wrong.

203
00:15:30,334 --> 00:15:32,894
Well, if it wasn't them,
then who?

204
00:15:36,062 --> 00:15:38,231
What are you saying,
one of us did it?

205
00:15:38,324 --> 00:15:40,329
Who the hell would
wantto go after Sun?

206
00:15:40,408 --> 00:15:44,171
Not much upside in scarin'
the crap out of 46 people...

207
00:15:45,191 --> 00:15:49,159
unless you're tryin' to con
'em into joining an army.

208
00:15:55,904 --> 00:15:58,359
Those necklaces
are junk, Sawyer.

209
00:15:58,499 --> 00:16:00,446
A 5-year-old could tell that.

210
00:16:00,584 --> 00:16:02,412
They ain't gonna be
lookin' at the necklaces,

211
00:16:02,442 --> 00:16:04,670
they gonna be lookin'
at the price tags.

212
00:16:04,714 --> 00:16:07,090
It's all in the
details, Dimples.

213
00:16:07,258 --> 00:16:09,268
What if we get caught?

214
00:16:09,391 --> 00:16:11,052
We ain't gonna get caught.

215
00:16:11,167 --> 00:16:14,871
Anybody goes to the cops,
only thing they're gonna remember

216
00:16:15,102 --> 00:16:18,970
is a guy who looks like
he's been in a bar fight.

217
00:16:22,731 --> 00:16:24,204
You're scared, huh?

218
00:16:25,276 --> 00:16:26,594
A little bit.

219
00:16:27,998 --> 00:16:32,371
Well, here's the good news, baby--
everybody's scared.

220
00:16:33,274 --> 00:16:35,625
And the thing they're
scared of most

221
00:16:35,719 --> 00:16:38,644
is missin' an opportunity.

222
00:16:46,813 --> 00:16:50,943
Hey. You guys want to
buy some necklaces?

223
00:16:51,037 --> 00:16:53,351
- Where'd you get 'em?
- Where do you think?

224
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:55,401
You want to buy 'em or not?

225
00:16:58,727 --> 00:17:00,409
Hell, forget it.

226
00:17:00,618 --> 00:17:05,263
- Hey, how much?
- Hundred a piece.

227
00:17:05,402 --> 00:17:08,926
- For any of 'em?
- Yeah, yeah, taster's choice.

228
00:17:09,130 --> 00:17:13,305
I'll take the $1,200
one and the $1,300 one.

229
00:17:15,182 --> 00:17:16,210
Thanks.

230
00:17:16,630 --> 00:17:19,101
Hey, wait, wait. Hang on, man.

231
00:17:19,293 --> 00:17:21,835
- I'll buy some of those.
- Yeah, me, too.

232
00:17:23,162 --> 00:17:26,446
It's Dana's birthday next week.
This is perfect.

233
00:17:26,557 --> 00:17:28,151
They love their jewelry.

234
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,440
$500, $600, $700.

235
00:17:36,552 --> 00:17:39,527
Pulse is good. Strong.

236
00:17:39,734 --> 00:17:42,368
You just need to--
to watch her.

237
00:17:45,262 --> 00:17:47,885
She's gonna be okay, man.

238
00:18:09,405 --> 00:18:10,635
That bump on her head--

239
00:18:10,774 --> 00:18:13,342
do you think she fell or
that someone hit her?

240
00:18:13,486 --> 00:18:15,168
I don't know.

241
00:18:17,805 --> 00:18:21,184
Jack, how well do
you know Ana Lucia?

242
00:18:25,482 --> 00:18:28,601
Just... the others...

243
00:18:29,748 --> 00:18:31,939
I was out there with you.

244
00:18:32,088 --> 00:18:35,541
I heard that man say that if we
stayed away, they'd leave us alone.

245
00:18:35,681 --> 00:18:37,103
And we've left them alone.

246
00:18:37,242 --> 00:18:40,096
So why would they attack
us a few days later?

247
00:18:40,481 --> 00:18:43,150
If it wasn't them,
then who was it?

248
00:18:48,551 --> 00:18:53,364
Like I said,
how well do you know Ana Lucia?

249
00:19:07,501 --> 00:19:11,080
I got a couple more people
interested in joining up.

250
00:19:11,117 --> 00:19:12,264
Yeah? Who?

251
00:19:12,344 --> 00:19:15,724
The big guy who lives
behind Sayid and Scott.

252
00:19:16,257 --> 00:19:18,882
You mean Steve. Scott's dead.

253
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:22,882
Scott, Steve... the point is,

254
00:19:23,027 --> 00:19:24,625
after what happened,

255
00:19:24,745 --> 00:19:28,384
people are finally
willing to do something.

256
00:19:28,477 --> 00:19:30,408
Where  were you this morning?

257
00:19:31,305 --> 00:19:32,978
Lots of places.

258
00:19:33,231 --> 00:19:35,226
During the rainstorm?

259
00:19:38,449 --> 00:19:42,544
You think I had something to
do with sun getting grabbed?

260
00:19:43,445 --> 00:19:46,810
Now where would youget
an idea like that?

261
00:19:47,419 --> 00:19:48,312
Jack!

262
00:19:48,919 --> 00:19:49,784
Jack...

263
00:19:52,057 --> 00:19:53,959
Sun's awake.

264
00:20:00,127 --> 00:20:07,131
Hey. How's your head?
Any pain, dizziness?

265
00:20:07,690 --> 00:20:09,113
Just  a little bit.

266
00:20:09,907 --> 00:20:11,470
Do you remember anything?

267
00:20:11,611 --> 00:20:15,418
I was working in my garden
when Vincent ran up,

268
00:20:15,512 --> 00:20:17,221
then it started raining.

269
00:20:17,337 --> 00:20:19,336
Then there was a
bag over my head,

270
00:20:19,415 --> 00:20:20,726
and I was being dragged.

271
00:20:20,881 --> 00:20:24,686
How many were there? I don't...
I didn't see anything.

272
00:20:29,454 --> 00:20:31,759
I kicked and I fought,

273
00:20:31,843 --> 00:20:35,445
and I just ranas fast as I could,
and then I fell...

274
00:20:42,407 --> 00:20:43,113
Gun.

275
00:20:44,395 --> 00:20:45,042
Gun!

276
00:20:51,733 --> 00:20:52,294
Gun.

277
00:20:57,395 --> 00:21:00,487
Relax, okay?

278
00:21:00,811 --> 00:21:03,188
Hey, what's going on?

279
00:21:04,168 --> 00:21:08,264
Looks like the good folks of
Islandtown are about to form a posse,

280
00:21:08,466 --> 00:21:10,616
get themselves armed up.

281
00:21:11,428 --> 00:21:14,928
Hell, I wouldn't be surprised if Jack
didn't find that horse of yours,

282
00:21:15,043 --> 00:21:18,099
start leadin' the charge
in a big white hat.

283
00:21:27,387 --> 00:21:28,999
The guns.

284
00:21:29,933 --> 00:21:32,691
This is all her play to
get her hands on the guns.

285
00:21:35,654 --> 00:21:38,988
Locke-- you need to go and
tell him that they're coming.

286
00:21:39,071 --> 00:21:40,676
I need to tell him?

287
00:21:41,745 --> 00:21:43,789
Sawyer, please.

288
00:21:50,109 --> 00:21:52,712
- So what's next?
- Next?

289
00:21:52,863 --> 00:21:54,227
The next play?

290
00:21:56,514 --> 00:21:58,414
I'll show you the pigeon drop.

291
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:01,335
We already did that-- twice.

292
00:22:01,497 --> 00:22:05,450
And the Tulsa bag scam
and the looky loo.

293
00:22:06,551 --> 00:22:10,094
- I want to do a big one.
- You want to do a big what?

294
00:22:10,232 --> 00:22:11,900
A big con.

295
00:22:12,806 --> 00:22:17,001
- It's called a long con.
- Okay, a long con.

296
00:22:17,744 --> 00:22:19,711
How does it work?

297
00:22:20,247 --> 00:22:24,097
It works by gettin' somebody to ask you
to do something like it's their idea,

298
00:22:24,107 --> 00:22:26,954
but it's not their idea.
It's your idea.

299
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:29,816
But none of that matters,

300
00:22:30,297 --> 00:22:34,707
'cause the one thing we need
for the long con we ain't got...

301
00:22:34,893 --> 00:22:35,955
money.

302
00:22:37,530 --> 00:22:39,482
I have money.

303
00:22:39,654 --> 00:22:43,557
Sorry, Cassie, 40 grand in
some mutual fund ain't money.

304
00:22:44,210 --> 00:22:47,660
Remember when I told you that I
didn't get anything from the divorce?

305
00:22:47,776 --> 00:22:50,439
- Mm-hmm.
- I kinda lied.

306
00:22:51,056 --> 00:22:57,247
- Kinda lied how much?
- 600 grand.

307
00:23:00,184 --> 00:23:03,388
Well, hell, baby, with that kind of
money, let's go find an island somewhere

308
00:23:03,418 --> 00:23:06,977
and sit on a beach drinkin'
mojitos till we go toes up.

309
00:23:07,482 --> 00:23:12,722
Sawyer, for the first time in my life,
I'm actually happy,

310
00:23:13,761 --> 00:23:17,367
and it's not really about
the action or the money.

311
00:23:17,524 --> 00:23:20,603
It's about doing this with you.

312
00:23:21,721 --> 00:23:23,241
Come on.

313
00:23:23,828 --> 00:23:26,155
One long con?

314
00:23:28,631 --> 00:23:31,210
And then the mojitos.

315
00:23:34,562 --> 00:23:36,367
I'll think about it.

316
00:23:38,093 --> 00:23:41,524
Why don't you think
about it in here?

317
00:23:52,877 --> 00:23:56,555
Hate to interrupt whatever
the hell it is you're doin'.

318
00:23:57,756 --> 00:23:59,473
What are you doin'?

319
00:23:59,711 --> 00:24:01,501
I'm alphabetizing.

320
00:24:02,761 --> 00:24:05,405
Sure. Sun gets attacked
in the jungle.

321
00:24:05,516 --> 00:24:08,763
You figure it's a good time to
start the damn Dewey decimal system.

322
00:24:08,793 --> 00:24:09,961
Good thinkin'.

323
00:24:10,144 --> 00:24:11,770
How can I help you, James?

324
00:24:12,737 --> 00:24:14,636
Well, actually, John,

325
00:24:15,031 --> 00:24:17,818
I'm here to help you,
give you the heads up.

326
00:24:18,281 --> 00:24:19,195
Heads up?

327
00:24:19,362 --> 00:24:22,406
Seems Jack's on his way over here
to open your little gun closet

328
00:24:22,436 --> 00:24:24,004
and take whatever he needs.

329
00:24:24,402 --> 00:24:26,228
You should know he's not alone.

330
00:24:26,394 --> 00:24:30,062
Whole camp's pretty shook up
about what happened to Tokyo Rose.

331
00:24:30,170 --> 00:24:34,014
I'm guessin' everybody's gonna
wanna play cowboys and indians,

332
00:24:34,725 --> 00:24:37,723
and once those guns
are out and about,

333
00:24:38,273 --> 00:24:40,970
something tells me they
ain't never goin' back in.

334
00:24:46,451 --> 00:24:48,372
Why are you telling me this?

335
00:24:51,571 --> 00:24:54,094
'Cause  it'll piss off Jack.

336
00:24:55,872 --> 00:25:00,168
If I were you,
I'd change that combination, pronto.

337
00:25:02,147 --> 00:25:05,580
But that won't work.
The door will just slow him down.

338
00:25:05,708 --> 00:25:08,332
If Jack wants to get in,
he'll get in.

339
00:25:10,519 --> 00:25:12,132
Will you help me?

340
00:25:13,732 --> 00:25:15,217
Help you what?

341
00:25:16,263 --> 00:25:18,487
Move the guns.

342
00:25:20,223 --> 00:25:21,815
Move 'em where?

343
00:25:23,284 --> 00:25:26,045
Fine. You don't want to trust me?
Lots of luck.

344
00:25:26,217 --> 00:25:28,437
But I can't leave
the hatch unmanned.

345
00:25:29,394 --> 00:25:31,536
Oh, sure.

346
00:25:31,767 --> 00:25:33,019
You move the guns,

347
00:25:33,341 --> 00:25:36,321
and I'll stay here and push
your damn button for you.

348
00:25:36,787 --> 00:25:38,829
How long till they get here?

349
00:25:39,435 --> 00:25:43,153
Well, that ain't my problem, Hoss.
It's yours.

350
00:25:56,281 --> 00:25:59,553
Steak sandwich... two beers.

351
00:26:00,964 --> 00:26:01,824
Thank you.

352
00:26:02,072 --> 00:26:04,218
Aw, Shucks,
you got a beer for me?

353
00:26:04,464 --> 00:26:06,968
You want one? Ask the lady.

354
00:26:07,724 --> 00:26:09,634
Well, hell, I dowant one,

355
00:26:09,781 --> 00:26:13,305
and, um,
could I get a plate of chicken salad,

356
00:26:13,411 --> 00:26:16,964
white meat only, and please,
god, no celery,okay, sweetheart?

357
00:26:17,074 --> 00:26:19,216
That's how we make
it here, darlin'.

358
00:26:21,288 --> 00:26:22,296
So...

359
00:26:23,104 --> 00:26:25,125
tell me you got her.

360
00:26:29,534 --> 00:26:30,670
Yeah, I got her.

361
00:26:30,855 --> 00:26:31,850
All 600 grand?

362
00:26:33,461 --> 00:26:34,477
All 6.

363
00:26:39,197 --> 00:26:40,980
You fell for her.

364
00:26:42,101 --> 00:26:43,824
Oh, come on.
You gotta be kidding me.

365
00:26:43,854 --> 00:26:46,245
- Look, it's got nothin' to do--
- Hey, I found that bitch.

366
00:26:46,275 --> 00:26:47,640
Her name is Cassidy.

367
00:26:47,741 --> 00:26:50,119
Well, I waited six months while
you and Cassidy played house.

368
00:26:50,149 --> 00:26:52,693
- Now if you think--
- I ain't doin' it.

369
00:26:53,475 --> 00:26:57,026
You know what's makin' you stupid
right now? It's your damn hormones.

370
00:26:57,136 --> 00:26:59,610
You think you're in love,
but you're not.

371
00:27:00,122 --> 00:27:02,722
You know, a tiger doesn't
change his stripes, James.

372
00:27:02,994 --> 00:27:04,918
You're a con man, just like me,

373
00:27:05,242 --> 00:27:10,008
and it's not what you do, it's what
you are. Do I make myself clear?

374
00:27:12,574 --> 00:27:15,118
I'm sorry, man.
I just can't do it.

375
00:27:15,282 --> 00:27:16,927
No, you're gonna do it.

376
00:27:17,453 --> 00:27:21,080
Because that girl--
she doesn't know you one bit.

377
00:27:21,864 --> 00:27:26,045
But when she finds out who you are,
who you really are,

378
00:27:26,147 --> 00:27:28,428
she's gonna hate your guts.

379
00:27:32,072 --> 00:27:33,239
Yeah, well...

380
00:27:36,095 --> 00:27:39,198
enjoy your chicken
salad, Gordy.

381
00:27:39,290 --> 00:27:42,373
Wait a minute.
You don't walk away now.

382
00:27:42,478 --> 00:27:45,710
You owe me.
You don't want to pay me?

383
00:27:45,950 --> 00:27:49,946
I'll put one in
your ear, James...

384
00:27:50,596 --> 00:27:53,045
you and your little
friend Cassidy.

385
00:28:15,602 --> 00:28:17,097
What are you doing here?

386
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:20,833
One second. I'm, like, this close
to the high score on "Donkey Kong."

387
00:28:33,472 --> 00:28:35,896
Now... what can I do you for?

388
00:28:35,990 --> 00:28:38,223
- Where's Locke?
- I don't know.

389
00:28:38,565 --> 00:28:42,165
I think he said something about going
to the store for a pack of smokes.

390
00:29:00,751 --> 00:29:04,118
Uh-oh, looks like we
got ourselves a theft.

391
00:29:04,209 --> 00:29:06,602
- Who's gonna call the cops?
- Where are they?

392
00:29:06,785 --> 00:29:09,785
Don't look at me.
I was just pushin' a button.

393
00:29:11,857 --> 00:29:15,700
Oh, yeah.
I believe these are yours.

394
00:29:22,737 --> 00:29:23,384
No.

395
00:29:23,838 --> 00:29:24,587
Sawyer...

396
00:29:47,067 --> 00:29:49,778
John... where are they?

397
00:29:50,649 --> 00:29:52,528
You moved the guns.
Where are they?

398
00:29:54,811 --> 00:29:56,487
We had an agreement!

399
00:29:56,602 --> 00:29:59,786
An agreement that you were
about to violate, Jack.

400
00:30:00,849 --> 00:30:03,321
Yes, I moved the guns.

401
00:30:03,484 --> 00:30:04,134
Where?

402
00:30:05,517 --> 00:30:06,131
Where?

403
00:30:07,674 --> 00:30:08,743
Where, John?

404
00:30:08,850 --> 00:30:11,194
Oh, are you gonna
start handin' 'em out?

405
00:30:11,902 --> 00:30:14,328
How many? Who gets 'em?

406
00:30:16,311 --> 00:30:20,121
How much time before there's an
accident-- another accident?

407
00:30:22,117 --> 00:30:25,067
I made a mistake teaching
Michael how to shoot. Now he's...

408
00:30:26,339 --> 00:30:28,444
he could be deadfor all I know,
and that--

409
00:30:28,608 --> 00:30:32,058
that was my fault.
I take responsibility for that, and so,

410
00:30:32,141 --> 00:30:35,079
yes, I'm taking
responsibility for the guns.

411
00:30:35,178 --> 00:30:36,576
I want two guns, John!

412
00:30:36,693 --> 00:30:38,273
I'm sorry, Jack,
that's the way it's gonna be, Jack.

413
00:30:38,303 --> 00:30:40,453
Two guns.
Tell me where they are right now!

414
00:30:52,306 --> 00:30:53,755
You gave him the guns?

415
00:30:55,234 --> 00:30:58,518
No. I hid them.

416
00:30:58,686 --> 00:31:02,893
That's right, Jack.
He's as stupid as you are.

417
00:31:03,053 --> 00:31:07,386
You two were so busy worryin' about each
other, you never even saw me comin',
did ya?

418
00:31:13,264 --> 00:31:15,584
So how 'bout you listen up?

419
00:31:15,734 --> 00:31:18,524
'Cause I'm only
gonna say this once.

420
00:31:21,561 --> 00:31:23,636
You took my stuff.

421
00:31:24,380 --> 00:31:26,660
While I was off tryin'
to get us help,

422
00:31:27,405 --> 00:31:29,138
get us rescued,

423
00:31:29,724 --> 00:31:34,407
you found my stash,
and you took it, divvied it up--

424
00:31:34,487 --> 00:31:37,965
my shaving cream,
my batteries...

425
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:40,129
even my beer.

426
00:31:40,758 --> 00:31:43,192
And then somethin'
else happened.

427
00:31:43,304 --> 00:31:48,727
You decided these two boys here were
gonna tell you what to do and when to
do it.

428
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:51,450
Well, I'm done taking orders.

429
00:31:54,614 --> 00:31:56,274
And I don't want my stuff back.

430
00:31:58,546 --> 00:32:00,763
Shaving cream don't matter.

431
00:32:01,706 --> 00:32:03,068
Batteries don't matter.

432
00:32:04,832 --> 00:32:07,452
Only thing that matters now...

433
00:32:08,317 --> 00:32:09,576
are guns...

434
00:32:11,275 --> 00:32:15,822
and if you want one, you're gonna
have to come to me to get it!

435
00:32:20,625 --> 00:32:23,052
Oh, you want to torture me,
don't ya?

436
00:32:23,329 --> 00:32:26,174
Show everybody how
civilized you are.

437
00:32:28,990 --> 00:32:33,043
Go ahead.
But I'll die before I give 'em back.

438
00:32:35,284 --> 00:32:38,019
And then you'll really be screwed,
won't you?

439
00:32:45,265 --> 00:32:48,121
There's a new sheriff
in town, boys.

440
00:32:50,568 --> 00:32:53,111
Y'all best get used to it.

441
00:33:12,263 --> 00:33:14,795
What's goin' on?
Where were you?

442
00:33:16,418 --> 00:33:18,078
Sawyer, what happened?

443
00:33:19,566 --> 00:33:20,991
You see that black car?

444
00:33:21,088 --> 00:33:23,655
- Who is it?
- His name's Gordy--

445
00:33:23,828 --> 00:33:25,918
- my partner.
- What partner?

446
00:33:26,054 --> 00:33:28,320
If I don't walk out the
frontdoor with that briefcase

447
00:33:28,350 --> 00:33:30,635
in the next two minutes,
we're both dead.

448
00:33:30,729 --> 00:33:33,143
What happened?
That's the guy from the Mercado deal?

449
00:33:33,173 --> 00:33:35,230
There is no Mercado deal!

450
00:33:35,589 --> 00:33:39,668
I knew about the 600 grand you
had tucked away from the get-go.

451
00:33:40,803 --> 00:33:42,519
Cass...

452
00:33:44,014 --> 00:33:46,083
you were the long con.

453
00:33:51,659 --> 00:33:54,749
Son of a...
Go to hell! Go to hell!

454
00:33:55,547 --> 00:33:57,088
You gotta understand--

455
00:33:57,472 --> 00:34:00,865
Everything that's happened
between us in the past six months,

456
00:34:01,022 --> 00:34:02,312
all of it--

457
00:34:02,934 --> 00:34:04,641
it was real.

458
00:34:04,828 --> 00:34:06,212
Get out. You get out!

459
00:34:06,397 --> 00:34:09,105
Listen, you can hate
me all you want later,

460
00:34:09,465 --> 00:34:12,747
but right now you
gotta listen to me.

461
00:34:13,024 --> 00:34:14,458
He's gonna kill us,

462
00:34:16,140 --> 00:34:19,608
'cause I told him I wasn't
gonna take your money.

463
00:34:23,482 --> 00:34:24,567
Oh, my god.

464
00:34:24,762 --> 00:34:27,290
Look, let's just...

465
00:34:28,922 --> 00:34:29,808
Okay.

466
00:34:31,172 --> 00:34:32,634
This is what we're gonna do--

467
00:34:32,733 --> 00:34:35,033
I want you to go out back
through Evan's yard.

468
00:34:35,042 --> 00:34:37,020
There's a rental car
parked out front.

469
00:34:37,129 --> 00:34:38,732
Go to Sioux city.

470
00:34:39,296 --> 00:34:43,005
I want you to check in
the Sage Flower motel.

471
00:34:44,256 --> 00:34:45,835
It's off highway 29.

472
00:34:47,038 --> 00:34:49,568
Watch TV, have a drink.

473
00:34:50,515 --> 00:34:55,090
Wait for me. I'll be there in the A.M.,
And it'll all be over.

474
00:34:55,182 --> 00:34:57,382
- Let me just pack a few--
- There's no time.

475
00:34:59,356 --> 00:35:02,499
Hey, remember when you said
I was all you ever wanted?

476
00:35:04,034 --> 00:35:06,416
Well, now you know better.

477
00:35:12,019 --> 00:35:13,128
I love you.

478
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:17,327
I love you, too.

479
00:35:21,765 --> 00:35:23,656
Go. Go.

480
00:35:38,845 --> 00:35:40,065
How'd you do it?

481
00:35:41,671 --> 00:35:43,292
How'd I do what?

482
00:35:44,550 --> 00:35:49,281
Locke said that he left you in the
hatch when he went to hide the guns,

483
00:35:50,176 --> 00:35:53,032
and we both know you
can't track worth a damn.

484
00:35:54,994 --> 00:35:56,952
So how'd you get them?

485
00:35:59,415 --> 00:36:01,913
A magician never
tells his secrets.

486
00:36:04,186 --> 00:36:05,573
You played us.

487
00:36:06,908 --> 00:36:08,120
You played me.

488
00:36:10,003 --> 00:36:12,053
All that stuff you
said about Ana Lucia--

489
00:36:12,140 --> 00:36:13,658
you knew I would go to Jack,

490
00:36:13,835 --> 00:36:15,912
and you knew I'd ask
youto go to Locke.

491
00:36:17,709 --> 00:36:20,685
Now how in the world
would I know all that?

492
00:36:23,450 --> 00:36:25,941
Did you have anything
to do with Sun?

493
00:36:27,067 --> 00:36:29,494
What kind of a person
you think I am?

494
00:36:29,971 --> 00:36:32,611
What kind of a person
do I think you are?

495
00:36:33,404 --> 00:36:36,975
I don't think this has
anything to do with guns

496
00:36:37,067 --> 00:36:39,239
or with getting
your stash back.

497
00:36:39,344 --> 00:36:41,578
I think you want
people to hate you.

498
00:36:47,122 --> 00:36:50,600
Good thing you don't
hate me, Freckles.

499
00:36:59,074 --> 00:37:01,458
Why do you have to do this?

500
00:37:03,833 --> 00:37:06,407
You run, I con.

501
00:37:08,081 --> 00:37:10,889
A tiger don't
change his stripes.

502
00:37:38,911 --> 00:37:42,900
Hey, check this out-- I found a
manuscript in one of the suitcases.

503
00:37:42,984 --> 00:37:44,590
It's like a mystery book.

504
00:37:44,682 --> 00:37:46,489
I want to show you something.

505
00:37:49,944 --> 00:37:52,472
- Cool! You fixed it!
- We'll see.

506
00:37:53,759 --> 00:37:55,347
Hold on to this.

507
00:37:55,730 --> 00:37:57,471
Don't expect anything.

508
00:37:58,061 --> 00:38:01,023
The chances of getting a
signal are slim at best.

509
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:13,531
Static's good, right?

510
00:38:13,641 --> 00:38:16,465
No. Reception is good.

511
00:38:18,410 --> 00:38:21,760
- Wait, what's that?!
- It's Rousseau's signal.

512
00:38:21,931 --> 00:38:22,796
Ah, crap.

513
00:38:22,973 --> 00:38:25,325
But this radio has
a wider bandwidth.

514
00:38:28,938 --> 00:38:31,595
Hold it! Stop!
Do you hear that?!

515
00:38:35,651 --> 00:38:38,115
Duke ellington orchestra

516
00:38:38,296 --> 00:38:40,629
featuring Cootie... trumpet.

517
00:38:41,195 --> 00:38:43,528
Up next on wx...

518
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:48,297
the Glenn Miller orchestra
with "Moonlight Serenade."

519
00:38:57,431 --> 00:38:58,477
Whoa.

520
00:38:59,965 --> 00:39:01,865
You hear how clear that is?

521
00:39:02,131 --> 00:39:03,739
It's gotta be close, right?

522
00:39:04,122 --> 00:39:07,835
Radio waves at this frequency
bounce off the Ionosphere.

523
00:39:09,339 --> 00:39:11,810
They can travel
thousands of miles.

524
00:39:13,211 --> 00:39:15,358
It could be coming
from anywhere.

525
00:39:20,286 --> 00:39:22,249
Or any time.

526
00:39:26,816 --> 00:39:28,421
Just kiddin', dude.

527
00:40:03,854 --> 00:40:05,629
He never saw you, huh?

528
00:40:08,651 --> 00:40:12,001
No. He was more worried about his
sodding guns than being followed.

529
00:40:13,242 --> 00:40:13,757
Hmm.

530
00:40:19,088 --> 00:40:21,196
Figured you'd want
your friends back.

531
00:40:22,418 --> 00:40:26,448
If I wanted them, I would have taken
them before I told you where they were.

532
00:40:26,556 --> 00:40:28,238
That's not why I did it.

533
00:40:29,322 --> 00:40:30,744
It's not, huh?

534
00:40:31,242 --> 00:40:36,289
I wanted him to look like a fool,
to feel like a fool.

535
00:40:38,231 --> 00:40:44,360
Well, well. Looks like Johnny
Locke's got himself a nemesis.

536
00:40:44,461 --> 00:40:50,366
Sun can never find out
what I did to her. Never.

537
00:40:53,055 --> 00:40:54,511
Don't sweat it.

538
00:40:55,813 --> 00:40:58,036
They got bigger things
to worry about now.

539
00:41:02,717 --> 00:41:03,812
Sawyer...

540
00:41:06,889 --> 00:41:08,231
this idea...

541
00:41:08,902 --> 00:41:11,244
all of this, what we did--

542
00:41:12,037 --> 00:41:13,905
what made you...

543
00:41:15,532 --> 00:41:18,121
how does someone think
of something like that?

544
00:41:25,601 --> 00:41:26,951
Now go.

545
00:42:05,054 --> 00:42:06,421
One Mississippi...

546
00:42:08,183 --> 00:42:09,621
two Mississippi...

547
00:42:11,293 --> 00:42:12,516
three Mississippi...

548
00:42:14,578 --> 00:42:15,781
four Mississippi...

549
00:42:18,378 --> 00:42:19,966
five Mississippi...

550
00:43:09,343 --> 00:43:11,684
I'm not a good person, Charlie.

551
00:43:13,884 --> 00:43:16,333
Never did a good
thing in my life.

552
