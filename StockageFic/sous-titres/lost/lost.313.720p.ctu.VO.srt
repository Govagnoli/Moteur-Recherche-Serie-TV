00:00:00,355 --> 00:00:01,728
<i>Previously on</i> Lost...

2
00:00:01,787 --> 00:00:04,276
I was in a wheelchair,
paralyzed for four years.

3
00:00:04,347 --> 00:00:05,979
This island, it changed me.

4
00:00:06,026 --> 00:00:07,129
It made me whole.

5
00:00:07,223 --> 00:00:09,313
I'm so thankful for you, John.

6
00:00:09,642 --> 00:00:11,227
You stole my kidney.

7
00:00:11,362 --> 00:00:13,522
You needed a father
and I needed a kidney,

8
00:00:13,726 --> 00:00:15,114
and that's what happened.

9
00:00:15,376 --> 00:00:16,376
Get over it.

10
00:00:16,427 --> 00:00:17,884
I don't care what Jack said.

11
00:00:17,953 --> 00:00:20,397
They've got him, and we have
to get him back. I owe him that.

12
00:00:20,421 --> 00:00:21,771
How did you get onto this island?

13
00:00:21,783 --> 00:00:23,391
They brought me on the submarine.

14
00:00:23,392 --> 00:00:26,569
So your people-- they can just come
and go whenever they want?

15
00:00:26,694 --> 00:00:29,347
You never know
when a little c4 might come in handy.

16
00:00:40,594 --> 00:00:41,616
Name?

17
00:00:42,457 --> 00:00:43,457
John Locke.

18
00:00:44,685 --> 00:00:46,053
Marital status, Mr. Locke?

19
00:00:47,394 --> 00:00:48,427
Single.

20
00:00:48,966 --> 00:00:49,976
Girlfriend?

21
00:00:54,323 --> 00:00:55,656
Are your parents living?

22
00:00:57,128 --> 00:01:00,353
I was raised in foster care.
I never really knew my parents.

23
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:05,411
Have you ever considered
seeking out your biological parents?

24
00:01:08,432 --> 00:01:09,913
I don't see how that's relevant.

25
00:01:09,968 --> 00:01:12,253
It's relevant, Mr. Locke,
because if the government's

26
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:14,716
gonna continue paying
your disability insurance,

27
00:01:14,938 --> 00:01:17,810
I have to figure out whether or not
your condition has improved.

28
00:01:19,879 --> 00:01:22,867
So... How's your appetite?

29
00:01:24,933 --> 00:01:25,966
Fine.

30
00:01:27,607 --> 00:01:30,460
I see you stopped submitting
your therapy bills for reimbursement.

31
00:01:30,797 --> 00:01:32,352
It's 'cause I stopped going.

32
00:01:33,898 --> 00:01:34,898
Waste of time.

33
00:01:40,708 --> 00:01:43,152
It's just a temporary suspension,
Mr. Locke.

34
00:01:43,212 --> 00:01:46,156
As soon as you resume your sessions,
you can reapply.

35
00:01:46,502 --> 00:01:48,258
You think I'm temporarily disabled?

36
00:01:48,364 --> 00:01:50,197
Depression can be temporary, yes.

37
00:01:50,824 --> 00:01:54,073
And since you see fit to stop going
to therapy, I guess you're all better.

38
00:01:58,771 --> 00:01:59,848
Guess I am.

39
00:02:03,253 --> 00:02:04,274
Next!

40
00:02:15,439 --> 00:02:16,625
Over here!

41
00:02:23,605 --> 00:02:24,605
What is he doing?

42
00:02:28,909 --> 00:02:29,909
Good hands!

43
00:02:37,597 --> 00:02:38,642
Nice.

44
00:02:40,778 --> 00:02:43,220
She's the one who helped
me and Sawyer escape.

45
00:02:44,268 --> 00:02:45,336
What's up?

46
00:02:45,404 --> 00:02:46,743
I think it's gonna be a while...

47
00:02:55,957 --> 00:02:56,984
Hey, what?

48
00:03:01,281 --> 00:03:02,618
John, Rousseau's gone.

49
00:03:46,616 --> 00:03:49,393
This is gonna be more complicated
than we thought.

50
00:03:52,667 --> 00:04:06,160
Subtitles: swsub.com

51
00:04:09,334 --> 00:04:12,105
So you saying, we simply start
shooting people and hope for the best?

52
00:04:12,129 --> 00:04:14,346
We came here to rescue Jack,
and we're gonna do it.

53
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:16,270
But obviously
the circumstances have changed.

54
00:04:16,271 --> 00:04:18,379
- He may not want to be rescued.
- That is not him.

55
00:04:18,402 --> 00:04:19,435
That's not Jack.

56
00:04:19,772 --> 00:04:22,922
They must have done someûthing to him.
When they captured us, they drugged us.

57
00:04:22,969 --> 00:04:26,073
- He didn't appear to be drugged.
- They kidnapped him, held him prisoner.

58
00:04:26,074 --> 00:04:27,809
- He wouldn't just forget that.
- I agree,

59
00:04:27,832 --> 00:04:30,194
but until we know why,
we're putting our lives at risk.

60
00:04:30,206 --> 00:04:31,335
I'm not leaving him, Sayid.

61
00:04:31,336 --> 00:04:33,241
- We may not have a choice.
- It's Jack.

62
00:04:35,788 --> 00:04:38,444
The first time I saw him,
he was risking his life

63
00:04:38,538 --> 00:04:40,930
pulling people out
of burning airplane wreckage.

64
00:04:41,748 --> 00:04:44,616
If he's shaking hands with the others,
I'm sure he has a good reason.

65
00:04:45,059 --> 00:04:48,059
We just have to go down there
and find out what it is.

66
00:04:52,112 --> 00:04:53,223
What do you suggest?

67
00:04:53,319 --> 00:04:56,064
We wait till it's dark.
We approach Jack when he's alone...

68
00:04:58,425 --> 00:05:00,270
And if he wants out, we get him out.

69
00:05:02,579 --> 00:05:03,832
<i>Here's what we know, Crystal.</i>

70
00:05:03,833 --> 00:05:07,999
<i>The bolivian coal deposits
were stolen last night around 2:00 a.m.</i>

71
00:05:08,436 --> 00:05:11,060
<i>Oh, that means the cobra...
he's back.</i>

72
00:05:14,086 --> 00:05:15,366
<i>Has he been shot?</i>

73
00:05:15,602 --> 00:05:16,602
<i>I can't find him!</i>

74
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:21,454
<i>He's armed! I can't get up!</i>

75
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:26,252
Hello. John Locke?

76
00:05:27,302 --> 00:05:28,607
I'm sorry. No solicitors.

77
00:05:29,802 --> 00:05:32,385
- I have a sign.
- I'm not trying to sell you...

78
00:05:33,421 --> 00:05:35,221
Listen, my name's Peter Talbot.

79
00:05:35,529 --> 00:05:37,482
I just need
a couple minutes to talk to you.

80
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:38,583
Talk about what?

81
00:05:38,878 --> 00:05:40,772
My mother, actually.

82
00:05:41,732 --> 00:05:43,352
I think she might be in some trouble.

83
00:05:43,494 --> 00:05:44,964
You got the wrong John Locke.

84
00:05:45,049 --> 00:05:46,660
How many kidneys do you have?

85
00:05:51,766 --> 00:05:53,232
She met him two months ago.

86
00:05:53,324 --> 00:05:55,546
"Love at first sight," is what she said.

87
00:05:55,778 --> 00:05:58,382
The guy was charming, sweet, funny.

88
00:05:59,434 --> 00:06:00,711
His name's Adam Seward.

89
00:06:01,083 --> 00:06:03,852
He's a retired computer entrepreneur
from Ontario.

90
00:06:06,775 --> 00:06:09,863
Anyway, Adam had something... special.

91
00:06:10,194 --> 00:06:12,918
My mom just went gaga for him
right out of the gate.

92
00:06:13,131 --> 00:06:16,235
After two months of knowing him,
she agree to marry the guy.

93
00:06:16,382 --> 00:06:18,048
And something about him...

94
00:06:19,238 --> 00:06:21,536
Something in my gut told me
that he was after something,

95
00:06:21,633 --> 00:06:23,476
so I had to check him out.

96
00:06:25,542 --> 00:06:28,146
Well, I'm not sure I know
what any of this has to do with me.

97
00:06:28,147 --> 00:06:30,810
Well, what this has to do
with you, Mr. Locke,

98
00:06:31,856 --> 00:06:34,911
is that you donated
one of your kidneys to Adam Seward,

99
00:06:35,606 --> 00:06:37,717
only his name was different back then.

100
00:06:38,888 --> 00:06:40,735
He used to be "Anthony Cooper."

101
00:06:47,022 --> 00:06:49,244
All I could find
were his medical records,

102
00:06:50,525 --> 00:06:54,996
and I saw that he was the recipient
of a kidney transplant from... You.

103
00:06:56,383 --> 00:06:57,449
So I figured, hey,

104
00:06:58,091 --> 00:07:00,349
someone gave the guy his kidney.
How bad could he be?

105
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:03,143
Right?

106
00:07:09,496 --> 00:07:12,842
Well, it-- it was an anonymous donation.

107
00:07:12,909 --> 00:07:13,909
I never met him.

108
00:07:19,675 --> 00:07:20,675
Are you sure?

109
00:07:20,893 --> 00:07:22,776
Yeah, I'm sorry. I can't help you.

110
00:08:07,908 --> 00:08:09,446
Sayid, you guard the front.

111
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:10,895
I'll go around and cover the back.

112
00:08:11,027 --> 00:08:13,447
- You head in through the side door.
- I'm going in alone?

113
00:08:13,544 --> 00:08:15,940
It's better
if you're the first one he sees.

114
00:08:16,101 --> 00:08:17,111
All right.

115
00:09:41,571 --> 00:09:42,862
What are you doing here?

116
00:09:43,995 --> 00:09:45,161
I came to get you.

117
00:09:45,615 --> 00:09:46,616
Get out of here

118
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:47,914
right now. Go.

119
00:09:48,903 --> 00:09:50,236
Kate, they're watching me!

120
00:09:51,523 --> 00:09:53,191
- Get out of here!
- I'm not leaving you.

121
00:09:53,214 --> 00:09:54,745
- Yes, you are!
- Get down!

122
00:09:54,757 --> 00:09:56,302
Don't hurt her!

123
00:09:56,349 --> 00:09:57,518
Step back, doc.

124
00:09:57,773 --> 00:09:58,907
Step back.

125
00:10:02,876 --> 00:10:03,876
Hold him still.

126
00:10:06,831 --> 00:10:07,997
Who else is with you?

127
00:10:14,435 --> 00:10:16,157
Just answer the question, Kate.

128
00:10:17,712 --> 00:10:19,008
Okay, one more time--

129
00:10:21,418 --> 00:10:22,816
who else is with you?

130
00:10:27,854 --> 00:10:28,854
Nobody.

131
00:10:29,783 --> 00:10:31,356
Nobody else. It was just us.

132
00:11:07,369 --> 00:11:08,535
Keep your voice down.

133
00:11:09,668 --> 00:11:10,668
All right.

134
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:13,838
It's all right, John.

135
00:11:13,976 --> 00:11:15,777
You don't have to point the gun at me.

136
00:11:15,778 --> 00:11:17,389
I can tell you where Jack is.

137
00:11:18,611 --> 00:11:19,950
I'm not looking for Jack.

138
00:11:23,298 --> 00:11:25,118
I'm looking for the submarine.

139
00:11:29,276 --> 00:11:30,351
The submarine...

140
00:11:31,099 --> 00:11:32,099
where is it?

141
00:11:32,457 --> 00:11:34,207
I'm not sure what you mean, John.

142
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:35,777
What submarine?

143
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:38,544
The one you use
to travel to and from the island...

144
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:41,724
The one your man Mikhail told me about

145
00:11:42,351 --> 00:11:43,613
right before I killed him.

146
00:11:45,098 --> 00:11:47,071
Dad? Who are you talking to?

147
00:11:47,144 --> 00:11:48,460
Alex, don't come in here!

148
00:11:53,609 --> 00:11:54,645
Tell her to be quiet.

149
00:11:54,646 --> 00:11:55,757
Alex, please.

150
00:11:56,498 --> 00:11:57,609
Ben, you awake?

151
00:12:04,614 --> 00:12:05,614
I'm coming in.

152
00:12:08,271 --> 00:12:09,271
What is it?

153
00:12:09,658 --> 00:12:11,142
It's Austen and Jarrah.

154
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:13,795
They're here. Somehow they found us.

155
00:12:14,977 --> 00:12:16,069
Where are they now?

156
00:12:16,127 --> 00:12:18,676
We captured them.
We're holding 'em over at my place.

157
00:12:18,677 --> 00:12:19,868
Want me to help you get out--

158
00:12:19,915 --> 00:12:22,283
Separate them.
I want to know how they found us.

159
00:12:22,391 --> 00:12:24,187
What about Juliet and Shepard?

160
00:12:24,216 --> 00:12:26,283
- Tomorrow--
- Let me worry about that. Just go.

161
00:12:26,284 --> 00:12:27,284
Got it.

162
00:12:28,035 --> 00:12:29,312
Richard, wait a minute.

163
00:12:29,338 --> 00:12:30,338
I'll wait outside.

164
00:12:36,745 --> 00:12:38,751
I want you to bring me
the man from Tallahassee.

165
00:12:40,908 --> 00:12:43,499
- What do you need him for?
- Just do it. Now.

166
00:12:54,382 --> 00:12:56,731
"The man from Tallahassee"?
What is that...

167
00:12:56,987 --> 00:12:57,987
Some kind of code?

168
00:12:58,085 --> 00:13:00,345
No, John, unfortunately,
we don't have a code

169
00:13:00,388 --> 00:13:03,496
for "there's a man in my closet
with a gun to my daughter's head,"

170
00:13:03,741 --> 00:13:05,415
although we obviously should.

171
00:13:08,149 --> 00:13:09,699
He had a pack with him.

172
00:13:11,202 --> 00:13:12,646
I want her to retrieve it.

173
00:13:14,556 --> 00:13:15,556
Okay.

174
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:18,709
But you should know, John,
my daughter currently hates me,

175
00:13:18,810 --> 00:13:21,215
so I'm not sure holding me hostage
is your best option--

176
00:13:21,216 --> 00:13:22,216
Dad!

177
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:24,970
I'll get your bag.

178
00:13:35,539 --> 00:13:36,913
No, nothing particular.

179
00:13:37,039 --> 00:13:39,341
I'm looking for something
really stunning,

180
00:13:39,390 --> 00:13:41,994
something that would grab
everyone's attention on the table.

181
00:13:42,449 --> 00:13:43,452
Honey?

182
00:13:44,878 --> 00:13:46,380
What do you think of this one?

183
00:13:47,118 --> 00:13:48,844
Oh, it looks good. What do you think?

184
00:13:49,105 --> 00:13:51,309
I like it. Maybe just a little larger.

185
00:13:57,617 --> 00:13:58,783
Larger would be good.

186
00:14:00,064 --> 00:14:01,532
I'll go over there and take a look.

187
00:14:08,483 --> 00:14:09,483
Hello, John.

188
00:14:10,218 --> 00:14:13,589
Gonna be a big to-do or just
the two of you and a preacher?

189
00:14:14,594 --> 00:14:17,269
I guess you couldn't invite me, huh?
That would make for...

190
00:14:18,051 --> 00:14:19,273
awkward introductions.

191
00:14:19,349 --> 00:14:20,591
How did you even know that I...

192
00:14:20,638 --> 00:14:25,053
I know because her son came to me
and asked why I gave you a kidney.

193
00:14:26,509 --> 00:14:28,963
He's on to you,
but he doesn't have any proof.

194
00:14:28,964 --> 00:14:31,519
So he came to me
hoping I would vouch for you.

195
00:14:32,666 --> 00:14:33,999
What did you say to him?

196
00:14:36,828 --> 00:14:38,550
You're conning her, aren't you?

197
00:14:39,931 --> 00:14:42,375
You're gonna marry her
for her money, right?

198
00:14:43,384 --> 00:14:44,893
What is it you want, John?

199
00:14:45,139 --> 00:14:46,305
I want you to end it.

200
00:14:47,542 --> 00:14:49,486
I want you to call off the wedding.

201
00:14:51,044 --> 00:14:52,321
Why are you doing this?

202
00:14:52,451 --> 00:14:54,713
Because it's not fair.

203
00:14:55,398 --> 00:14:58,063
You make people think
that you're their family,

204
00:14:58,728 --> 00:15:00,594
and then you leave their life in ruins,

205
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:03,059
and I'm not gonna let you do it again.

206
00:15:04,506 --> 00:15:07,006
You're gonna call off your engagement
and go,

207
00:15:08,071 --> 00:15:09,782
or I'm gonna tell her the truth.

208
00:15:12,622 --> 00:15:14,107
I want to hear you say it.

209
00:15:15,128 --> 00:15:16,628
You say you're gonna leave.

210
00:15:23,993 --> 00:15:24,993
Okay, John.

211
00:15:26,347 --> 00:15:27,347
You got it.

212
00:15:42,771 --> 00:15:45,026
Would you mind helping me
get into my chair?

213
00:15:47,724 --> 00:15:48,965
No tricks, I promise.

214
00:15:52,131 --> 00:15:53,519
I just want some dignity.

215
00:15:56,545 --> 00:16:00,134
You of all people should understand
what it means to want some dignity.

216
00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:09,298
Thank you.

217
00:16:13,723 --> 00:16:15,004
So tell me, John,

218
00:16:15,650 --> 00:16:17,533
how do you expect to pilot
our submarine?

219
00:16:17,833 --> 00:16:20,143
I mean, it's a complicated
piece of machinery.

220
00:16:20,788 --> 00:16:22,384
You don't just press "submerge."

221
00:16:22,385 --> 00:16:24,051
I'll figure something out.

222
00:16:25,287 --> 00:16:28,041
For all you know,
I was a commander in the navy.

223
00:16:32,504 --> 00:16:35,220
Put your arm around my neck.
I'll lift under your knees.

224
00:16:35,353 --> 00:16:36,741
What's in the pack, John?

225
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:39,589
If you've met Mikhail, that means

226
00:16:39,623 --> 00:16:41,539
you were in the communications
station...

227
00:16:43,565 --> 00:16:45,620
Which means you found the explosives.

228
00:16:47,949 --> 00:16:50,568
So you're not planning to pilot
the submarine anywhere, are you?

229
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:55,246
You're planning to destroy it.

230
00:16:59,345 --> 00:17:00,622
I know you, John Locke.

231
00:17:04,895 --> 00:17:06,283
You don't know me at all.

232
00:17:08,085 --> 00:17:10,046
I know you were born in California.

233
00:17:11,406 --> 00:17:13,517
I know you were raised in foster care.

234
00:17:14,416 --> 00:17:17,195
I know you wasted
a big part of your life in Tustin

235
00:17:17,367 --> 00:17:20,510
pushing papers at a company
that manufactured industrial boxes.

236
00:17:23,382 --> 00:17:24,631
I know you spent the four years

237
00:17:24,667 --> 00:17:27,614
prior to your arrival on this island
in a wheelchair.

238
00:17:31,311 --> 00:17:33,531
And I know how you ended up in it.

239
00:17:40,252 --> 00:17:41,252
Tell me, John...

240
00:17:42,499 --> 00:17:43,532
Did it hurt?

241
00:17:52,424 --> 00:17:53,797
I felt my back break.

242
00:17:57,005 --> 00:17:58,050
What do you think?

243
00:18:24,062 --> 00:18:26,673
I didn't think I'd see you again
so soon, Kate.

244
00:18:31,164 --> 00:18:32,373
Be careful in here.

245
00:18:34,022 --> 00:18:35,022
Thanks.

246
00:18:54,219 --> 00:18:55,276
Did they hurt you?

247
00:18:58,995 --> 00:18:59,995
Did they hurt you?

248
00:19:08,455 --> 00:19:09,455
What is all this?

249
00:19:11,765 --> 00:19:13,098
This is where they live.

250
00:19:15,769 --> 00:19:17,157
And the people they took?

251
00:19:18,627 --> 00:19:19,627
The kids?

252
00:19:19,930 --> 00:19:20,930
They're all safe.

253
00:19:24,581 --> 00:19:25,581
"Safe"?

254
00:19:31,698 --> 00:19:32,884
So you're with them now?

255
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:37,854
I'm not with anyone, Kate.

256
00:19:42,308 --> 00:19:43,641
What did they do to you?

257
00:19:44,859 --> 00:19:47,247
- Nothing.
- Then why are you acting like this?

258
00:19:48,367 --> 00:19:49,406
There's no way...

259
00:19:50,421 --> 00:19:51,884
You... There's no way that I could...

260
00:19:51,954 --> 00:19:53,128
I came here to help you!

261
00:19:53,129 --> 00:19:54,225
So why don't you tell me...

262
00:19:54,226 --> 00:19:56,448
I told you not to come back here for me.

263
00:19:57,927 --> 00:19:59,482
I didn't think you meant it.

264
00:20:37,588 --> 00:20:39,254
What did they do to you, Jack?

265
00:20:46,056 --> 00:20:47,389
I made a deal with them.

266
00:20:49,168 --> 00:20:50,501
They're gonna let me go.

267
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:55,419
Where?

268
00:20:58,274 --> 00:20:59,308
Home.

269
00:21:07,690 --> 00:21:08,690
When?

270
00:21:09,492 --> 00:21:10,992
First thing in the morning.

271
00:21:14,313 --> 00:21:16,348
I can bring back help.
It's our best chance.

272
00:21:16,412 --> 00:21:17,655
You trust these people?

273
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:19,263
They are liars. Why would you believe...

274
00:21:19,264 --> 00:21:21,708
I trust them
because you told me to, Kate...

275
00:21:23,859 --> 00:21:26,407
When you asked me
to save Sawyer's life.

276
00:21:36,047 --> 00:21:37,324
What did they tell you?

277
00:21:43,096 --> 00:21:45,104
Jack, we need to go.

278
00:21:48,570 --> 00:21:49,681
I'll be right there.

279
00:21:59,193 --> 00:22:01,953
I asked you not to come back here
for me, and I wish...

280
00:22:04,850 --> 00:22:06,127
I wish that you hadn't.

281
00:22:13,812 --> 00:22:15,543
But I will come back here for you.

282
00:22:48,892 --> 00:22:50,003
John Locke?

283
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:52,180
Detective Mason.

284
00:22:52,632 --> 00:22:55,250
That's detective Reed. Do you mind
if we ask you a few questions?

285
00:22:55,274 --> 00:22:56,283
No, of course not.

286
00:22:56,307 --> 00:22:58,239
Do you know a man named Peter Talbot?

287
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,170
No, I don't think so.

288
00:23:03,241 --> 00:23:05,366
Thin, brown hair, 20.

289
00:23:06,165 --> 00:23:08,042
If it'll be helpful,
we believe he was here

290
00:23:08,043 --> 00:23:09,537
in your apartment two days ago.

291
00:23:11,475 --> 00:23:12,831
Yeah, he was a solicitor.

292
00:23:12,967 --> 00:23:14,734
I sent him away.

293
00:23:14,815 --> 00:23:18,573
Mr. Talbot's family is worth somewhere
in the neighborhood of $200 million.

294
00:23:19,509 --> 00:23:22,503
So I'm curious. What exactly
was he selling you door-to-door?

295
00:23:22,526 --> 00:23:24,699
Well, I...
Look, I told you I don't know him.

296
00:23:24,722 --> 00:23:27,891
Then why was your name and address
on a piece of paper in his pocket?

297
00:23:30,945 --> 00:23:33,615
Why were you... would you be
looking through his pockets?

298
00:23:34,141 --> 00:23:35,703
Because Peter Talbot's dead.

299
00:23:42,507 --> 00:23:44,007
It wasn't easy, you know...

300
00:23:45,915 --> 00:23:48,257
Being in that hatch with you
all that time...

301
00:23:48,512 --> 00:23:50,900
Knowing you had no business
walking around,

302
00:23:51,411 --> 00:23:54,792
knowing I couldn't even ask you about it
without telling you who I really was.

303
00:23:55,385 --> 00:23:56,385
So ask me now...

304
00:23:59,145 --> 00:24:01,232
Now that I know who you really are.

305
00:24:05,850 --> 00:24:06,850
Was it immediate?

306
00:24:07,404 --> 00:24:09,348
It started the moment you got here?

307
00:24:11,734 --> 00:24:13,683
And you were just walking,
the feeling returned

308
00:24:13,718 --> 00:24:15,162
right after the crash, that day?

309
00:24:15,211 --> 00:24:17,008
That's what "immediate" means, Ben.

310
00:24:19,874 --> 00:24:22,305
You're wondering why
it hasn't happened for you.

311
00:24:23,518 --> 00:24:25,820
You're not recovering
as fast as you like.

312
00:24:28,084 --> 00:24:30,146
How long's it been since Jack fixed you?

313
00:24:30,738 --> 00:24:31,759
A week?

314
00:24:32,689 --> 00:24:34,031
Now that I think about it,

315
00:24:34,747 --> 00:24:36,403
how did you get sick in the first place?

316
00:24:36,521 --> 00:24:38,409
Are you afraid it'll go away, John?

317
00:24:39,645 --> 00:24:41,691
Is that why you want
to destroy the submarine?

318
00:24:41,692 --> 00:24:44,756
'Cause you know if you leave the island,
you'll be back in the chair?

319
00:24:48,879 --> 00:24:50,212
You got anything to eat?

320
00:25:11,985 --> 00:25:14,814
Go on home, kid.
You know you're not supposed to be here.

321
00:25:15,282 --> 00:25:17,170
My father sent me to get his pack.

322
00:25:20,836 --> 00:25:21,836
Why?

323
00:25:22,290 --> 00:25:24,550
I don't know, Ryan,
but he told me to get it.

324
00:25:25,466 --> 00:25:26,466
All right.

325
00:25:27,770 --> 00:25:28,770
Here you go.

326
00:25:34,486 --> 00:25:35,819
You're Alex, aren't you?

327
00:25:37,726 --> 00:25:38,748
Hey! Can it.

328
00:25:39,295 --> 00:25:40,628
How do you know my name?

329
00:25:41,861 --> 00:25:43,639
Because you look like your mother.

330
00:25:46,775 --> 00:25:47,867
My mother is dead.

331
00:25:50,109 --> 00:25:51,950
I'm sure that's what they told you.

332
00:25:54,816 --> 00:25:55,816
Get going, Alex!

333
00:26:03,917 --> 00:26:05,146
Keep your mouth shut.

334
00:26:13,796 --> 00:26:15,407
Where do you get electricity?

335
00:26:15,698 --> 00:26:18,067
We have two giant hamsters
running on a massive wheel

336
00:26:18,068 --> 00:26:20,527
- at our secret underground lair.
- Yeah, that's funny.

337
00:26:21,608 --> 00:26:23,956
There's leftovers in the refrigerator.
Help yourself.

338
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:37,379
I ate most of the dark meat. Sorry.

339
00:26:42,433 --> 00:26:46,326
I never really appreciated chicken
until right now.

340
00:26:48,647 --> 00:26:50,741
I know you think you need
to do this, John,

341
00:26:50,890 --> 00:26:52,519
but if you blow up my submarine,

342
00:26:52,697 --> 00:26:54,863
I'll have a big problem with my people.

343
00:26:55,157 --> 00:26:57,632
Is that supposed to be
an incentive not to blow it up?

344
00:27:00,810 --> 00:27:02,254
I was born on this island.

345
00:27:02,913 --> 00:27:04,730
Not many of my people can say that.

346
00:27:04,864 --> 00:27:07,023
Most of them were recruited
and brought here.

347
00:27:07,024 --> 00:27:09,024
And as much as they love this place,

348
00:27:09,128 --> 00:27:11,273
as much as they would do anything
to defend it,

349
00:27:11,355 --> 00:27:13,868
they need to know they can leave
if they want to.

350
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:17,806
The sub maintains that illusion.

351
00:27:18,584 --> 00:27:19,686
So you're lying to 'em.

352
00:27:19,687 --> 00:27:22,089
No. They're here
because they want to be here.

353
00:27:22,144 --> 00:27:25,301
Some of them are just not ready
to make a full... commitment yet.

354
00:27:26,949 --> 00:27:27,949
But you, John...

355
00:27:30,403 --> 00:27:32,403
You've already made that commitment,

356
00:27:32,553 --> 00:27:33,955
and now you have a choice.

357
00:27:33,956 --> 00:27:36,011
Because if you stop and if you think,

358
00:27:36,110 --> 00:27:37,567
I can show you things...

359
00:27:38,574 --> 00:27:41,087
things I know you want
to see very badly.

360
00:27:43,562 --> 00:27:45,564
Let me put it so you'll understand.

361
00:27:49,066 --> 00:27:50,111
Picture a box.

362
00:27:51,835 --> 00:27:54,383
You know something about boxes,
don't you, John?

363
00:27:54,790 --> 00:27:57,273
What if I told you
that somewhere on this island

364
00:27:57,444 --> 00:27:59,774
there's a very large box,

365
00:28:00,782 --> 00:28:03,679
and whatever you imagined,
whatever you wanted to be in it,

366
00:28:04,752 --> 00:28:08,325
when you opened at box,
there it would be.

367
00:28:11,012 --> 00:28:13,012
What would you say about that, John?

368
00:28:16,670 --> 00:28:20,495
I'd say I hope that box is big enough
to imagine yourself up a new submarine.

369
00:28:24,477 --> 00:28:26,866
- Why are you so angry, John?
- Because you're cheating.

370
00:28:26,999 --> 00:28:28,065
You and your people

371
00:28:28,664 --> 00:28:31,314
communicate with the outside world
whenever you want to.

372
00:28:31,735 --> 00:28:33,343
You come and go as you please.

373
00:28:33,345 --> 00:28:35,956
You use electricity
and running water and guns.

374
00:28:36,251 --> 00:28:38,604
You're a hypocrite, a Pharisee.

375
00:28:39,057 --> 00:28:40,903
You don't deserve to be on this island.

376
00:28:41,107 --> 00:28:44,690
If you had any idea
what this place really was,

377
00:28:46,459 --> 00:28:48,900
you wouldn't be putting chicken
in your refrigerator.

378
00:28:48,936 --> 00:28:51,721
You've been here 80 days, John.
I've been here my entire life.

379
00:28:53,536 --> 00:28:57,060
So how is it that you think
you know this island better than I do?

380
00:28:57,389 --> 00:28:59,491
Because you're in the wheelchair,

381
00:29:00,846 --> 00:29:01,846
and I'm not.

382
00:29:18,678 --> 00:29:20,122
Did you have any problems?

383
00:29:26,798 --> 00:29:28,630
Okay, here's how this is gonna work...

384
00:29:28,818 --> 00:29:30,520
she's gonna take me to the sub.

385
00:29:30,655 --> 00:29:31,953
Once we're there, I let her go.

386
00:29:32,005 --> 00:29:33,833
John, she's done enough.
Let me take you.

387
00:29:34,164 --> 00:29:36,035
I don't want you to slow me down.

388
00:29:37,224 --> 00:29:39,056
Come on. Let's go.

389
00:29:39,621 --> 00:29:41,538
John, before you go, you should know...

390
00:29:42,805 --> 00:29:44,085
Jack and I made a deal.

391
00:29:45,686 --> 00:29:47,510
In less than an hour
he's leaving this island

392
00:29:47,557 --> 00:29:49,739
on that submarine,
and it's a 1-way ticket.

393
00:29:50,292 --> 00:29:52,298
The anomaly wiped out
our communications.

394
00:29:52,368 --> 00:29:55,021
We have no way of contacting
the outside world...

395
00:29:55,497 --> 00:29:57,611
Which means when that sub leaves,

396
00:29:58,751 --> 00:30:00,028
it can never come back.

397
00:30:00,955 --> 00:30:02,469
So whether you destroy the submarine

398
00:30:02,539 --> 00:30:05,056
or whether you let it go,
the end result is the same--

399
00:30:05,938 --> 00:30:07,438
no one will find this island.

400
00:30:10,644 --> 00:30:11,644
Let's go.

401
00:30:14,094 --> 00:30:15,256
Come on.

402
00:30:18,058 --> 00:30:20,064
You know he's manipulating you, right?

403
00:30:20,365 --> 00:30:21,365
How's that?

404
00:30:21,813 --> 00:30:24,387
That's what my father does.
He manipulates people.

405
00:30:25,025 --> 00:30:27,691
He makes you think it's your idea,
but it's his.

406
00:30:27,973 --> 00:30:29,695
I'll have to keep that in mind.

407
00:30:39,704 --> 00:30:41,092
Submarine's down there...

408
00:30:41,382 --> 00:30:42,745
At the end of the dock.

409
00:30:45,224 --> 00:30:47,390
I'm sorry I had to involve you in this.

410
00:32:01,001 --> 00:32:02,953
Look, I know you don't owe me anything,

411
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:05,557
but I need to ask you
for one last favor.

412
00:32:11,842 --> 00:32:12,842
You don't knock?

413
00:32:16,801 --> 00:32:18,523
I need you to let my friends go

414
00:32:19,448 --> 00:32:20,448
after I'm gone.

415
00:32:21,659 --> 00:32:24,492
And if I said no,
would that stop you from leaving?

416
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:25,615
Of course it would.

417
00:32:30,967 --> 00:32:33,189
Your friends
are only here to rescue you.

418
00:32:33,871 --> 00:32:36,677
But you seem to be doing
a good job of rescuing yourself, so...

419
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:42,551
I suppose
there's no reason to keep them here.

420
00:32:43,487 --> 00:32:45,042
Do I have your word on that?

421
00:32:49,042 --> 00:32:50,042
You have my word.

422
00:32:51,662 --> 00:32:54,823
I'll let them go
just as soon as you've left the island.

423
00:33:04,317 --> 00:33:05,705
Well, I guess this is it.

424
00:33:10,949 --> 00:33:12,091
Thank you, Ben,

425
00:33:13,735 --> 00:33:15,181
for keeping your promise.

426
00:33:52,594 --> 00:33:53,855
Hold it right there!

427
00:33:54,294 --> 00:33:55,294
Get your hands up!

428
00:33:55,648 --> 00:33:57,861
Get down! I said get down!

429
00:34:09,524 --> 00:34:10,801
What are you doing here, John?

430
00:34:12,025 --> 00:34:13,215
I'm sorry, Jack.

431
00:34:16,534 --> 00:34:17,534
Sorry for what?

432
00:34:45,356 --> 00:34:46,356
What did you do?

433
00:34:47,857 --> 00:34:49,727
Tell me you didn't do it.

434
00:34:50,392 --> 00:34:53,598
- What are you talking about?
- Tell me that you didn't kill that kid!

435
00:34:53,941 --> 00:34:54,941
What?

436
00:34:54,949 --> 00:34:57,395
You think I had something to do
with Peter's death?

437
00:34:57,419 --> 00:34:59,098
I tell you to end things
with his mother,

438
00:34:59,121 --> 00:35:00,674
and the next thing you know, he's dead!

439
00:35:00,698 --> 00:35:02,157
John, now calm down, please.

440
00:35:02,276 --> 00:35:04,648
Think about what you're saying.
Why would I kill Peter?

441
00:35:04,667 --> 00:35:05,667
He was on to you!

442
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:09,492
I've been doing this for a long time.
I'm not sweating some rich kid.

443
00:35:09,513 --> 00:35:10,723
Then why are you still here?

444
00:35:10,724 --> 00:35:12,450
- What do you mean?
- I tell you to leave.

445
00:35:12,497 --> 00:35:15,471
You tell me you're gonna leave town.
Why are you still here?

446
00:35:16,635 --> 00:35:17,887
Now listen, John,

447
00:35:18,151 --> 00:35:19,531
I'll be honest with you.

448
00:35:20,490 --> 00:35:21,490
I didn't end it.

449
00:35:21,996 --> 00:35:23,496
I was looking for an angle.

450
00:35:23,746 --> 00:35:26,092
I wanted to make some money
before I skipped out.

451
00:35:26,853 --> 00:35:28,353
But then all this happened.

452
00:35:29,054 --> 00:35:31,988
Peter died, and everything
just went straight into the tank.

453
00:35:33,873 --> 00:35:34,976
She's devastated.

454
00:35:36,424 --> 00:35:37,764
She's called off the wedding.

455
00:35:38,570 --> 00:35:40,236
There's no profit in it, John.

456
00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:43,117
I'm a con man, not a murder.

457
00:35:46,176 --> 00:35:47,676
She called off the wedding?

458
00:35:49,330 --> 00:35:51,274
She said she couldn't deal with it.

459
00:35:52,191 --> 00:35:55,474
- She needs to be alone.
- So if I were to call her right now,

460
00:35:56,113 --> 00:35:57,674
that's what she would tell me?

461
00:36:00,519 --> 00:36:02,241
Phone's right over there, John.

462
00:36:08,897 --> 00:36:10,130
What's her numb--

463
00:36:16,929 --> 00:36:19,788
Mr. Locke, we know this isn't
what you want to hear, but...

464
00:36:20,722 --> 00:36:21,777
Your father's gone.

465
00:36:23,032 --> 00:36:25,461
We know he fled to Mexico
shortly after your...

466
00:36:25,702 --> 00:36:28,156
encounter, then he disappeared.

467
00:36:29,141 --> 00:36:32,282
I'm sorry, but he could be
anywhere in the world right now.

468
00:36:34,637 --> 00:36:35,639
All right, detectives,

469
00:36:35,890 --> 00:36:38,476
that's enough.
Mr. Locke has work to do today.

470
00:36:40,862 --> 00:36:43,084
We'll let you know if anything develops.

471
00:36:45,929 --> 00:36:49,282
We have got ourselves quite a day
ahead of us, my friend.

472
00:36:49,855 --> 00:36:52,080
It's finally time
to get you up out of that bed.

473
00:36:52,346 --> 00:36:53,857
No. I don't want to.

474
00:36:53,978 --> 00:36:55,173
I don't remember asking.

475
00:37:01,138 --> 00:37:02,138
Now...

476
00:37:02,791 --> 00:37:04,865
Most people struggle with this at first,

477
00:37:05,018 --> 00:37:06,150
but don't worry.

478
00:37:06,996 --> 00:37:08,218
You'll get used to it.

479
00:37:09,961 --> 00:37:11,940
No, please. I can't do this.

480
00:37:13,069 --> 00:37:15,008
You fell eight stories and survived.

481
00:37:16,209 --> 00:37:18,054
I don't want to hear
about what you can't do.

482
00:37:18,272 --> 00:37:19,410
Now let's go.

483
00:37:19,415 --> 00:37:20,480
It's gonna be all right.

484
00:37:20,819 --> 00:37:21,918
It's gonna be fine, John.

485
00:37:21,919 --> 00:37:23,476
- Come on.
- No, I can't...

486
00:37:29,806 --> 00:37:31,034
You're fine...

487
00:37:33,433 --> 00:37:34,433
There we go.

488
00:37:35,248 --> 00:37:36,497
There you go, buddy.

489
00:37:38,245 --> 00:37:39,314
See?

490
00:37:40,443 --> 00:37:41,776
Wasn't that bad, was it?

491
00:37:42,605 --> 00:37:44,015
Be right back, buddy.

492
00:38:22,209 --> 00:38:24,820
Well, John,
you've really gone and done it now.

493
00:38:25,894 --> 00:38:28,771
You don't have to pretend
to be disappointed anymore.

494
00:38:29,317 --> 00:38:31,530
We both know you wanted it to happen.

495
00:38:32,919 --> 00:38:35,278
That's why you left the c4
in Sayid's bag

496
00:38:35,376 --> 00:38:37,708
Because you wanted me to make it happen.

497
00:38:39,332 --> 00:38:40,835
Uncuff him, please, Richard.

498
00:38:47,351 --> 00:38:48,962
You gonna do anything stupid?

499
00:38:50,311 --> 00:38:51,311
No, sir.

500
00:38:57,074 --> 00:39:00,570
Do you remember earlier, John,
when you called me a cheater...

501
00:39:01,521 --> 00:39:04,511
When you said I didn't deserve
to live on this island? Well, get this--

502
00:39:04,734 --> 00:39:07,096
There I was, shaking hands with Jack

503
00:39:07,663 --> 00:39:10,125
and thinking I'd give almost anything
to come up with a way

504
00:39:10,202 --> 00:39:12,820
to stop him from leaving,
because to let him go

505
00:39:13,392 --> 00:39:15,952
would be a sign a weakness,
of failure, of defeat.

506
00:39:16,477 --> 00:39:18,979
My people would see that.
They would know it,

507
00:39:19,570 --> 00:39:21,296
and that, John, would be the end of me.

508
00:39:21,785 --> 00:39:22,785
But to kill him...

509
00:39:25,191 --> 00:39:26,519
That would be cheating,

510
00:39:27,204 --> 00:39:29,269
because my people
also heard me make a promise,

511
00:39:29,270 --> 00:39:30,662
and to break my word...

512
00:39:32,254 --> 00:39:34,087
that would be the end of me, too.

513
00:39:37,872 --> 00:39:41,411
And then you came striding out
of the jungle, John...

514
00:39:43,825 --> 00:39:46,207
to you make my dream come true.

515
00:39:49,137 --> 00:39:52,692
You're not gonna start talking
about the magic box again, are you?

516
00:39:56,819 --> 00:39:58,831
I'm gonna show you what came out of it.

517
00:40:11,567 --> 00:40:13,418
When I asked you earlier if it hurt

518
00:40:13,419 --> 00:40:16,506
when you suffered your injury,
I think you misunderstood me.

519
00:40:16,686 --> 00:40:19,902
It seems fairly obvious
that when a person's back smashes

520
00:40:19,926 --> 00:40:22,256
into a hard surface after being thrown
from a building,

521
00:40:22,315 --> 00:40:24,030
that's gonna sting a little.

522
00:40:24,498 --> 00:40:27,112
But I really wasn't asking
about the physical pain.

523
00:40:28,401 --> 00:40:30,367
What, do you want to know
if it hurt my feelings?

524
00:40:30,402 --> 00:40:32,941
No, John.
I wanted to know what it felt like

525
00:40:33,009 --> 00:40:35,175
when your own father tried to kill you.

526
00:40:38,769 --> 00:40:41,678
He's the reason you destroyed
the submarine, isn't he?

527
00:40:43,024 --> 00:40:44,024
You're afraid.

528
00:40:44,876 --> 00:40:48,229
You're afraid of him, and this is
the one place he can never find you.

529
00:40:48,314 --> 00:40:50,281
This is the one place
he can never get to.

530
00:40:50,282 --> 00:40:51,670
What do you want from me?

531
00:40:55,192 --> 00:40:56,648
I don't know how it happened...

532
00:40:58,897 --> 00:41:02,649
But you seem to have
some communion with this island, John,

533
00:41:03,079 --> 00:41:05,192
and that makes you very, very important.

534
00:41:06,661 --> 00:41:08,856
You have no idea
what you're talking about, of course,

535
00:41:08,891 --> 00:41:11,930
but in time you'll have
a better understanding of things.

536
00:41:13,915 --> 00:41:14,915
So what do I want?

537
00:41:16,673 --> 00:41:18,061
I want to help you, John.

538
00:41:20,674 --> 00:41:21,695
Why?

539
00:41:23,182 --> 00:41:25,626
Because I'm in a wheelchair,
and you're not.

540
00:41:32,346 --> 00:41:33,512
Are you ready to see?

541
00:42:15,103 --> 00:42:16,103
Dad?
