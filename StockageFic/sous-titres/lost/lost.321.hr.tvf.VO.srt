2
00:00:02,324 --> 00:00:03,947
Desmond said I was gonna die.

3
00:00:04,069 --> 00:00:06,724
He told me he has
these flashes... visions.

4
00:00:06,874 --> 00:00:09,961
When I saw the lightning hit the roof,
you were electrocuted.

5
00:00:10,083 --> 00:00:11,848
And when you heard
Claire was in the water,

6
00:00:11,878 --> 00:00:14,803
you drowned trying to save her.
I dove in myself, so you never went in.

7
00:00:14,925 --> 00:00:16,449
No matter what I try to do,

8
00:00:16,585 --> 00:00:18,002
you're gonna die, Charlie.

9
00:00:18,124 --> 00:00:19,478
There's a woman in Hurley's tent

10
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,468
who parachuted
onto the island yesterday.

11
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:24,558
She says that the boat she took off from
is about 80 miles off the coast,

12
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:27,650
and if she can find a way to contact it,
we'll all be rescued.

13
00:00:27,772 --> 00:00:29,078
Why didn't anyone tell me this?

14
00:00:29,282 --> 00:00:30,769
Because they don't trust you.

15
00:00:31,124 --> 00:00:32,209
<i>Kwon is pregnant.</i>

16
00:00:32,364 --> 00:00:33,364
Where'd you get that?

17
00:00:33,477 --> 00:00:35,811
You really think
you're in a position to ask questions?

18
00:00:35,835 --> 00:00:37,853
I told Jack what they were making me do.

19
00:00:38,022 --> 00:00:39,299
Why didn't you tell us?

20
00:00:39,522 --> 00:00:41,899
Because I hadn't decided
what to do about it yet.

21
00:01:17,811 --> 00:01:19,223
Anyone wants to venture a guess

22
00:01:19,348 --> 00:01:22,186
as to what Jack's gonna be showing us
out in the middle of nowhere?

23
00:01:22,497 --> 00:01:23,977
I don't know. Stuff.

24
00:01:25,122 --> 00:01:26,344
Probably secret stuff.

25
00:01:27,303 --> 00:01:29,250
Why does everything
have to be such a secret?

26
00:01:29,372 --> 00:01:31,233
How about some openness
for a change?

27
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:33,942
We kept the parachute lady secret.

28
00:01:34,064 --> 00:01:35,230
Ah, that's different.

29
00:01:35,375 --> 00:01:36,375
Different how?

30
00:01:36,873 --> 00:01:39,666
Well, because we weren't out there
playing football with them.

31
00:01:40,064 --> 00:01:41,064
What?

32
00:01:42,397 --> 00:01:43,436
Nothing.

33
00:01:43,562 --> 00:01:44,562
Wait.

34
00:01:46,169 --> 00:01:48,111
You had one of your flashes
again, didn't you?

35
00:01:48,874 --> 00:01:50,096
No, Charlie, I didn't.

36
00:01:53,747 --> 00:01:54,747
We're here.

37
00:02:07,249 --> 00:02:08,546
A couple of nights ago,

38
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:11,547
Juliet came to me,
and she told me everything...

39
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:15,857
That Ben had sent her here to find out
which of our women were pregnant.

40
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,721
So what, you guys
were doing tests on us?

41
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,166
No, but that's what he wanted me to do.

42
00:02:21,247 --> 00:02:24,249
I've been leaving tapes
at the medical station.

43
00:02:24,897 --> 00:02:26,248
You all heard what he said.

44
00:02:26,374 --> 00:02:27,707
They're coming tomorrow.

45
00:02:29,135 --> 00:02:31,861
Sun, I'm sorry that I lied to you.

46
00:02:33,062 --> 00:02:34,827
While I appreciate your honesty, Jack,

47
00:02:35,249 --> 00:02:37,434
it doesn't explain
why you brought us out here.

48
00:02:51,624 --> 00:02:52,624
Show 'em.

49
00:03:14,373 --> 00:03:16,399
When Juliet told me they where coming,

50
00:03:17,375 --> 00:03:18,960
the first thing I thought was,

51
00:03:19,788 --> 00:03:21,707
where the hell
are we gonna hide this time?

52
00:03:22,388 --> 00:03:23,717
But hiding's pointless.

53
00:03:23,935 --> 00:03:25,747
They're just gonna keep coming back.

54
00:03:26,748 --> 00:03:28,609
So I went out, and I found some help.

55
00:03:29,692 --> 00:03:30,739
And for the past few days,

56
00:03:30,861 --> 00:03:33,160
she's been bringing dynamite
back from "the black rock."

57
00:03:33,853 --> 00:03:34,889
For the very first time,

58
00:03:35,011 --> 00:03:38,156
we know exactly what they want,
when they're coming to get it,

59
00:03:38,309 --> 00:03:40,129
and they have no idea

60
00:03:41,267 --> 00:03:42,788
that we're gonna be waiting for 'em.

61
00:03:44,828 --> 00:03:47,259
So Juliet's gonna mark the tents
with the white rocks,

62
00:03:47,381 --> 00:03:48,573
just like she was told to,

63
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:52,403
but there's not gonna be
any pregnant women inside.

64
00:03:52,525 --> 00:03:54,741
There's gonna be plenty
of what we used on that tree.

65
00:03:56,002 --> 00:03:57,188
So tomorrow night...

66
00:03:58,578 --> 00:03:59,578
We stop hiding.

67
00:04:00,017 --> 00:04:01,062
We stop running.

68
00:04:01,184 --> 00:04:04,295
We stop living in fear of them,
because when they show up...

69
00:04:07,577 --> 00:04:09,410
we're gonna blow 'em all to hell.

70
00:04:10,761 --> 00:04:22,732
Subtitles: swsub.com

71
00:04:32,708 --> 00:04:33,708
Bloody hell!

72
00:04:34,269 --> 00:04:35,772
Why are we even doing this?

73
00:04:35,894 --> 00:04:36,894
Chin up, mate.

74
00:04:37,175 --> 00:04:38,958
- We're headlining.
- Headlining?

75
00:04:39,441 --> 00:04:40,792
We're playing Clitheroe...

76
00:04:41,019 --> 00:04:42,273
The arse end of nowhere.

77
00:04:42,395 --> 00:04:43,395
A gig's a gig.

78
00:04:43,772 --> 00:04:45,006
We're building our fan base.

79
00:04:45,148 --> 00:04:47,584
Will our fan base pay
for a new sodding tire?

80
00:04:47,898 --> 00:04:49,136
Only if we show up.

81
00:04:50,053 --> 00:04:52,051
So let's just get on with it, shall we?

82
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:54,129
You know what, Liam?

83
00:04:54,291 --> 00:04:55,449
You get on with it.

84
00:04:55,645 --> 00:04:56,645
I quit.

85
00:04:57,083 --> 00:04:59,442
- You're giving up?
- There's nothing to give up on!

86
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:02,830
We're broke! The album's not selling!
We're a bloody joke!

87
00:05:02,952 --> 00:05:04,019
Hey, shut it!

88
00:05:05,271 --> 00:05:06,271
Listen.

89
00:05:11,404 --> 00:05:12,505
That's us.

90
00:05:15,949 --> 00:05:17,107
We're on the radio!

91
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:21,838
That we are.

92
00:05:21,997 --> 00:05:23,750
We're on the bloody radio!

93
00:05:29,266 --> 00:05:30,677
I told you, baby brother!

94
00:05:30,799 --> 00:05:32,445
We're gonna be bloody rock stars.

95
00:05:39,796 --> 00:05:40,943
Can I ask you something?

96
00:05:44,499 --> 00:05:46,516
Who are you people
about to go to war with?

97
00:05:47,468 --> 00:05:48,816
Oh, that's a long story.

98
00:05:48,938 --> 00:05:50,424
Want to ask me something else?

99
00:05:51,207 --> 00:05:52,274
You having a laugh?

100
00:05:53,078 --> 00:05:54,185
Of course not.

101
00:05:54,492 --> 00:05:56,513
I'd never disrespect a fellow Mancunian.

102
00:05:57,468 --> 00:05:59,614
- You're from Manchester, then?
- I am.

103
00:05:59,814 --> 00:06:02,673
My band got its start at
the night and day bar on Oldham street.

104
00:06:03,241 --> 00:06:05,316
- What band?
- We were called Drive Shaft.

105
00:06:06,435 --> 00:06:07,712
Yeah. Yeah, I know you.

106
00:06:08,035 --> 00:06:09,836
We had our moment in the sun.

107
00:06:09,958 --> 00:06:11,366
No, not that... the crash.

108
00:06:11,747 --> 00:06:13,031
You're the dead rock star.

109
00:06:13,179 --> 00:06:15,563
They made a big deal out of you
when they found the plane.

110
00:06:15,871 --> 00:06:17,724
Huge memorial service, new album.

111
00:06:17,909 --> 00:06:18,911
There's a new album?

112
00:06:19,033 --> 00:06:20,804
Yeah. God, it was everywhere...

113
00:06:20,977 --> 00:06:22,316
A "greatest hits" thing.

114
00:06:28,127 --> 00:06:29,948
Hey, look on the bright side.

115
00:06:30,378 --> 00:06:31,933
You're not really dead, right?

116
00:06:33,814 --> 00:06:34,814
Yeah, right.

117
00:06:58,913 --> 00:07:00,081
We need more wire,

118
00:07:00,973 --> 00:07:03,059
so we can trigger these
from a safe distance.

119
00:07:03,181 --> 00:07:05,397
I can get people to start
stripping the plane wreckage.

120
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:08,268
Good. I should be able
to finish rigging these tents

121
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:09,677
in the next 24 hours.

122
00:07:10,193 --> 00:07:11,885
We'll be ready by tomorrow night.

123
00:07:17,845 --> 00:07:19,417
We need to talk about Naomi's phone.

124
00:07:19,539 --> 00:07:21,309
- Not now.
- If you're angry I doubted you,

125
00:07:21,431 --> 00:07:23,455
I'd be happy to make
a sincere apology later,

126
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:26,344
- but now we have a means...
- Look, I'm a little bit busy right now.

127
00:07:26,466 --> 00:07:28,827
And I am trying to get us
off this island!

128
00:07:32,823 --> 00:07:34,222
I can't transmit using this phone

129
00:07:34,344 --> 00:07:37,125
because Danielle's distress signal
is overriding the frequency.

130
00:07:38,432 --> 00:07:40,128
If you tell me where the radio tower is,

131
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:42,743
I can go there, switch off
your message and call for help.

132
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:45,333
My signal has been playing
for the last 16 years,

133
00:07:45,455 --> 00:07:46,601
and nobody has heard it.

134
00:07:46,749 --> 00:07:48,504
Why do you think
you'll have better luck?

135
00:07:48,626 --> 00:07:51,951
Naomi's boat is only 80 miles offshore.

136
00:07:52,922 --> 00:07:55,333
I know if we eliminate
Danielle's signal, they'll hear us.

137
00:07:55,378 --> 00:07:56,440
No, they won't.

138
00:07:57,250 --> 00:07:58,250
And why is that?

139
00:07:59,338 --> 00:08:00,382
We're jamming it.

140
00:08:00,808 --> 00:08:01,808
What?

141
00:08:01,886 --> 00:08:03,560
Ben is using one of the Dharma stations

142
00:08:03,585 --> 00:08:06,099
to block all of the signals off
of the island except for ours.

143
00:08:06,125 --> 00:08:07,125
What station?

144
00:08:07,501 --> 00:08:09,104
They call it the "Looking Glass."

145
00:08:09,902 --> 00:08:11,236
- The looking glass?
- Yes.

146
00:08:11,358 --> 00:08:13,513
But it's underwater.
I have no idea where it is.

147
00:08:15,875 --> 00:08:16,875
I believe I do.

148
00:08:19,064 --> 00:08:21,004
Look, I know...
I know Jack thinks it's best,

149
00:08:21,126 --> 00:08:23,620
but, you know, what if
they're coming for him again?

150
00:08:26,126 --> 00:08:27,292
Claire, listen to me.

151
00:08:28,125 --> 00:08:29,347
I'm gonna protect you.

152
00:08:29,877 --> 00:08:31,333
I'm gonna protect Aaron.

153
00:08:32,769 --> 00:08:33,876
I promise.

154
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,765
Look, everything is gonna be fine.

155
00:08:41,848 --> 00:08:42,859
Sorry.

156
00:08:45,076 --> 00:08:46,695
Can you give me a hand with something?

157
00:08:49,203 --> 00:08:50,259
Of course.

158
00:09:03,238 --> 00:09:05,622
So you ready to tell me
what you saw this morning?

159
00:09:06,437 --> 00:09:07,437
Aye.

160
00:09:08,688 --> 00:09:10,981
Right. So how does it happen this time?

161
00:09:14,939 --> 00:09:15,939
Come on, Des!

162
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:18,014
You can tell me. I can take it.

163
00:09:23,178 --> 00:09:24,678
What I saw, Charlie, was...

164
00:09:26,301 --> 00:09:28,480
Claire and her baby
getting into a helicopter...

165
00:09:29,616 --> 00:09:30,727
A helicopter that...

166
00:09:32,428 --> 00:09:35,040
That lifts off, leaves this island.

167
00:09:41,301 --> 00:09:42,301
You sure?

168
00:09:42,867 --> 00:09:43,867
Aye.

169
00:09:44,367 --> 00:09:45,478
Rescue helicopter...

170
00:09:46,051 --> 00:09:47,051
On this beach?

171
00:09:47,365 --> 00:09:48,857
This island? That's what you saw?

172
00:09:51,301 --> 00:09:52,912
We're getting bloody rescued!

173
00:09:53,468 --> 00:09:55,841
I thought you were gonna tell me
I was gonna die again.

174
00:10:01,239 --> 00:10:02,239
You are, Charlie.

175
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:05,801
Wait. What?

176
00:10:07,431 --> 00:10:08,550
If you don't...

177
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:10,999
none of it will happen.

178
00:10:13,021 --> 00:10:14,465
There won't be any rescue.

179
00:10:17,957 --> 00:10:19,058
I'm sorry, brother...

180
00:10:20,316 --> 00:10:21,328
but this time...

181
00:10:24,447 --> 00:10:26,047
This time you have to die.

182
00:10:35,247 --> 00:10:36,303
Come on!

183
00:10:40,796 --> 00:10:42,942
Come on, Charlie. Jump in!

184
00:10:43,601 --> 00:10:44,934
I'm gonna catch you, boy.

185
00:10:46,037 --> 00:10:48,116
No. You're just going to back away.

186
00:10:48,322 --> 00:10:50,010
Don't be daft. Jump in!

187
00:10:52,830 --> 00:10:55,157
I promise, Charlie. I'm gonna catch you.

188
00:10:55,447 --> 00:10:56,486
No, he won't!

189
00:10:57,198 --> 00:10:58,198
Zip it, you.

190
00:10:59,684 --> 00:11:01,409
Look, don't listen to your brother.

191
00:11:01,822 --> 00:11:02,884
Just jump on in.

192
00:11:05,884 --> 00:11:08,030
There's nothing to be afraid of,
Charlie.

193
00:11:09,573 --> 00:11:11,749
I'll catch you. I promise.

194
00:11:35,037 --> 00:11:36,133
I did it!

195
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:38,658
You got it!

196
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:41,351
- I did it.
- You're swimming, Charlie.

197
00:11:49,974 --> 00:11:51,053
What you writing?

198
00:11:59,007 --> 00:12:00,007
Nothing.

199
00:12:07,757 --> 00:12:08,812
All right, tell me.

200
00:12:11,944 --> 00:12:13,610
Are you sure you want to know?

201
00:12:15,723 --> 00:12:17,581
I mean, it might be easier
if you just...

202
00:12:19,232 --> 00:12:20,424
I want to know.

203
00:12:24,315 --> 00:12:25,541
You're inside a hatch.

204
00:12:25,873 --> 00:12:26,975
It's...

205
00:12:28,463 --> 00:12:29,851
a room full of equipment.

206
00:12:30,902 --> 00:12:32,466
There's a blinking yellow light

207
00:12:32,795 --> 00:12:34,171
above a switch.

208
00:12:34,865 --> 00:12:36,074
You flip the switch.

209
00:12:38,341 --> 00:12:39,341
Light goes off.

210
00:12:45,456 --> 00:12:46,580
And then you drown.

211
00:12:58,340 --> 00:12:59,340
When?

212
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:03,901
I don't know.

213
00:13:04,275 --> 00:13:06,736
You're sure you saw Claire and Aaron
get on that helicopter?

214
00:13:07,026 --> 00:13:08,026
Aye.

215
00:13:10,778 --> 00:13:11,778
So...

216
00:13:14,025 --> 00:13:15,982
before I... drown...

217
00:13:18,076 --> 00:13:19,597
I just have to flip a switch?

218
00:13:21,742 --> 00:13:22,786
That's right.

219
00:13:27,465 --> 00:13:28,465
Where is it, then?

220
00:13:32,827 --> 00:13:34,506
Now this is the Looking Glass.

221
00:13:35,151 --> 00:13:36,725
It's an underwater Dharma station.

222
00:13:37,090 --> 00:13:40,151
Please, can you tell me anything
you might know about this place?

223
00:13:40,346 --> 00:13:41,696
I've never been down there.

224
00:13:42,009 --> 00:13:43,462
I don't know anyone who has.

225
00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:45,150
Why not?

226
00:13:45,733 --> 00:13:47,186
There was some accident.

227
00:13:47,699 --> 00:13:50,023
Ben told us that the station
was completely flooded.

228
00:13:50,156 --> 00:13:52,206
Well, if it's flooded,
then how does it still work?

229
00:13:52,348 --> 00:13:53,858
How it still works is irrelevant.

230
00:13:54,025 --> 00:13:56,305
The question is, how do
we get it to stop working,

231
00:13:56,465 --> 00:13:58,163
so we could use the satellite phone?

232
00:14:00,825 --> 00:14:02,673
The diagram shows
that the looking glass

233
00:14:02,823 --> 00:14:04,686
is connected to the island by a cable.

234
00:14:05,464 --> 00:14:07,319
I feel sure that this is
the very same cable

235
00:14:07,464 --> 00:14:09,505
down the beach
which runs into the ocean.

236
00:14:09,954 --> 00:14:12,616
So if we follow the cable,
it should lead us to the station.

237
00:14:12,867 --> 00:14:14,423
So how are we gonna get in?

238
00:14:14,635 --> 00:14:15,724
We swim in.

239
00:14:16,013 --> 00:14:17,205
There's a moon pool...

240
00:14:18,422 --> 00:14:20,750
A room with an open floor
at the base of the station...

241
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:22,889
Big enough
for a submarine to dock.

242
00:14:23,171 --> 00:14:24,738
Even if the station's flooded,

243
00:14:25,378 --> 00:14:27,864
I think I'll be able to find
the relay switch and disable it.

244
00:14:28,013 --> 00:14:29,599
What about swimming back out?

245
00:14:32,883 --> 00:14:34,974
No. I'm not letting you
go on some suicide mission

246
00:14:35,153 --> 00:14:36,350
just to flip the switch.

247
00:14:36,473 --> 00:14:38,801
Someone has to do it,
or we'll never leave this island.

248
00:14:38,979 --> 00:14:39,979
I'll do it.

249
00:14:40,484 --> 00:14:42,925
I can swim down, turn off that
bloody switch, swim back up.

250
00:14:42,993 --> 00:14:44,004
Piece of cake.

251
00:14:44,041 --> 00:14:46,243
Charlie, you don't even know
what we're talking about.

252
00:14:46,334 --> 00:14:48,514
I was junior swim champion
in northern England.

253
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:50,040
I can hold my breath for 4 minutes.

254
00:14:50,108 --> 00:14:51,890
I know exactly what
you're talking about.

255
00:14:56,638 --> 00:14:58,761
No, and there's no reason
to do this now.

256
00:14:58,818 --> 00:15:01,361
We're gonna focus on the others,
and then we'll deal with this.

257
00:15:01,406 --> 00:15:03,763
Wait a minute.
We have a chance to signal for a rescue.

258
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:07,459
Look, for 90 days, I've been asked
to make decisions for this entire camp.

259
00:15:08,147 --> 00:15:09,804
There you go.
I just made one.

260
00:15:19,409 --> 00:15:20,976
Rose, that's a sailor's hitch.

261
00:15:21,543 --> 00:15:24,247
It's not gonna hold.
You wanna do a sheet bend like mine.

262
00:15:24,349 --> 00:15:25,984
Oh, so now you're a knot expert.

263
00:15:26,664 --> 00:15:27,999
Well, trust me, it's...

264
00:15:33,113 --> 00:15:34,214
How did you do that?

265
00:15:35,145 --> 00:15:36,553
Watch and learn, dear.

266
00:16:42,569 --> 00:16:44,018
Look there!
Look!

267
00:17:00,844 --> 00:17:02,213
Get off him, damn it!
It's okay.

268
00:17:02,258 --> 00:17:05,206
- What? He's one of them!
- I know! It's okay.

269
00:17:07,015 --> 00:17:08,411
He was in the cage next to me.

270
00:17:09,286 --> 00:17:10,478
I know this guy.

271
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:12,747
What the hell are you doing here, Karl?

272
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:15,046
They're... coming...

273
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,022
My people.

274
00:17:17,090 --> 00:17:19,647
Sorry you came all this way for nothing,
but we already know.

275
00:17:19,783 --> 00:17:21,012
Then why are you still here?

276
00:17:21,058 --> 00:17:23,968
'cause when they'll show up tomorrow
night, we're gonna be ready for 'em.

277
00:17:23,969 --> 00:17:27,020
Tomorrow? No, no,
they're coming tonight.

278
00:17:33,958 --> 00:17:35,418
They're coming right now!

279
00:17:40,885 --> 00:17:44,651
SIX HOURS AGO (del vo)

280
00:17:49,050 --> 00:17:50,272
When did you get back?

281
00:17:50,550 --> 00:17:51,555
Just now.

282
00:17:53,802 --> 00:17:54,802
Where's Locke?

283
00:17:57,823 --> 00:17:59,015
Here's your gun back.

284
00:18:04,417 --> 00:18:05,438
Ben, what's going on?

285
00:18:05,491 --> 00:18:06,491
Where's Ryan?

286
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:08,344
He's in his tent. Are you...

287
00:18:08,412 --> 00:18:09,740
It's time to get them.

288
00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:12,404
But you said tomorrow.

289
00:18:12,615 --> 00:18:14,226
Jacob wants it to happen now.

290
00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:16,398
Look, what happened out there?

291
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:18,202
- Did john see...
- John had an accident.

292
00:18:21,053 --> 00:18:22,053
Ryan?

293
00:18:22,177 --> 00:18:23,177
Yes, sir?

294
00:18:23,584 --> 00:18:24,679
If you leave right now,

295
00:18:24,736 --> 00:18:26,655
how long will it take you
to reach their camp?

296
00:18:27,152 --> 00:18:29,978
Well, if I take my ten best,
we could set up to hit 'em by nightfall.

297
00:18:30,069 --> 00:18:32,145
- Then you better get going.
- No, Ben, wait.

298
00:18:32,315 --> 00:18:33,399
Moving up the schedule...

299
00:18:33,468 --> 00:18:35,681
Juliet may not be ready.
What if she hasn't had time...

300
00:18:35,738 --> 00:18:37,441
Then we'll take all their women...

301
00:18:39,168 --> 00:18:41,064
And we'll sort out
the ones we need later.

302
00:18:41,667 --> 00:18:42,723
And the men?

303
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,338
If any of 'em are stupid enough
to get in your way,

304
00:18:45,989 --> 00:18:46,989
kill 'em.

305
00:18:47,975 --> 00:18:48,985
All right.

306
00:19:01,386 --> 00:19:02,442
Karl!

307
00:19:04,990 --> 00:19:05,990
It's me!

308
00:19:09,293 --> 00:19:10,678
I thought you were bringing rabbit.

309
00:19:10,724 --> 00:19:12,767
You have to go... now.

310
00:19:13,176 --> 00:19:15,163
What? Did he find out I was out here?

311
00:19:15,367 --> 00:19:17,742
No, but he's sending Pryce
to their beach camp right now,

312
00:19:17,865 --> 00:19:18,961
and you have to warn them.

313
00:19:19,011 --> 00:19:20,392
- Warn them?
- You have to go now!

314
00:19:20,442 --> 00:19:22,655
I thought they were just gonna
take the pregnant women.

315
00:19:22,685 --> 00:19:23,711
If you take the outrigger,

316
00:19:23,733 --> 00:19:25,409
you'll get there
a few hours before them.

317
00:19:25,764 --> 00:19:28,116
- Wait, Alex...
- He's gonna kill them Karl!

318
00:19:32,052 --> 00:19:33,829
Austen and Ford saved your life.

319
00:19:37,741 --> 00:19:38,741
You owe them.

320
00:19:42,745 --> 00:19:43,903
You better take this.

321
00:19:47,065 --> 00:19:49,313
If I get caught, your father's
gonna kill me this time.

322
00:19:49,553 --> 00:19:50,592
Is he my father?

323
00:20:00,226 --> 00:20:01,368
Now go.

324
00:20:27,475 --> 00:20:28,678
Is that everything?

325
00:20:31,905 --> 00:20:33,001
Can we trust him?

326
00:20:33,321 --> 00:20:34,388
You don't trust me?

327
00:20:34,593 --> 00:20:35,593
What about her?

328
00:20:36,091 --> 00:20:37,176
She's a spy.

329
00:20:38,373 --> 00:20:41,541
She's supposed to mark the tents
of the pregnant women with white rocks

330
00:20:41,663 --> 00:20:44,168
- so they can take them.
- They know, Karl, but thanks.

331
00:20:46,107 --> 00:20:48,548
- So what are we gonna do?
- We have to leave now... Hide.

332
00:20:48,903 --> 00:20:51,723
Where? It's their island.
f they wanna kill us, they'll find us.

333
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:55,814
The sun's gonna go down in a few hours.

334
00:20:56,433 --> 00:20:58,590
- Do we have enough wire yet?
- Not even close.

335
00:20:59,055 --> 00:21:01,368
We have to find out another way
to set the dynamite off.

336
00:21:01,490 --> 00:21:03,281
- We can shoot.
- We don't have enough guns.

337
00:21:03,403 --> 00:21:04,658
Ten of them are coming, armed.

338
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:06,211
Not the others... the tents.

339
00:21:06,333 --> 00:21:08,468
We can camouflage the dynamite
next to the tents,

340
00:21:08,598 --> 00:21:10,880
target it from our positions
at the tree line.

341
00:21:12,770 --> 00:21:15,566
Juliet marked three tents.
That means we need three guns.

342
00:21:17,086 --> 00:21:18,913
Here. You can have mine, too.

343
00:21:21,048 --> 00:21:22,126
I'll be your third.

344
00:21:23,951 --> 00:21:25,971
I'll take your gun,
but you're not staying here.

345
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:30,968
You're gonna lead everyone
to the radio tower... Everyone.

346
00:21:31,127 --> 00:21:32,151
The radio tower?

347
00:21:32,282 --> 00:21:34,432
If this doesn't work,
we can't risk losing the chance

348
00:21:34,554 --> 00:21:36,166
of getting in contact with Naomi's boat,

349
00:21:36,288 --> 00:21:38,427
so everything has to happen
at the same time.

350
00:21:43,692 --> 00:21:44,897
You still up for a swim?

351
00:21:48,253 --> 00:21:49,419
Yeah, I believe I am.

352
00:21:51,565 --> 00:21:52,565
I'll go with him.

353
00:21:53,752 --> 00:21:55,985
Okay, better get to it.

354
00:22:12,506 --> 00:22:13,846
It's here, baby brother.

355
00:22:14,151 --> 00:22:15,190
Christmas is here.

356
00:22:18,315 --> 00:22:20,177
Are these the birds from row two?

357
00:22:22,177 --> 00:22:23,358
Well done, mate.

358
00:22:29,238 --> 00:22:31,032
Well, as you have spent another year

359
00:22:31,449 --> 00:22:34,230
as the only drug-free
rock star in the world,

360
00:22:34,542 --> 00:22:36,676
I'm gonna share
a little-known fact with you.

361
00:22:39,436 --> 00:22:42,717
Father christmas lives
just down the street from here.

362
00:22:42,898 --> 00:22:44,510
Father christmas lives in Helsinki?

363
00:22:44,654 --> 00:22:45,812
Indeed he does,

364
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:47,841
and in case you haven't noticed,
baby brother,

365
00:22:48,216 --> 00:22:50,248
Finland is the bloody north pole.

366
00:22:52,922 --> 00:22:56,759
Therefore, I have a very special
gift for you this year.

367
00:23:02,690 --> 00:23:04,817
Liam, no. Mum gave you that.

368
00:23:05,136 --> 00:23:06,260
You're the firstborn.

369
00:23:06,848 --> 00:23:09,543
It was her father's
and his father before that.

370
00:23:09,665 --> 00:23:11,984
And it's a family heirloom,
and at's why we named the band

371
00:23:12,125 --> 00:23:13,311
after Dexter bloody Stratton.

372
00:23:13,452 --> 00:23:14,503
I know.

373
00:23:14,671 --> 00:23:16,805
But, Charlie, let's be honest.

374
00:23:18,628 --> 00:23:20,405
We both know I'm a sodding mess.

375
00:23:20,939 --> 00:23:22,925
But you... You're different.

376
00:23:23,335 --> 00:23:25,534
You're gonna get married,
have a family...

377
00:23:26,502 --> 00:23:27,604
A baby.

378
00:23:29,002 --> 00:23:30,338
I'll be lucky if I hit 30.

379
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:31,584
Don't say that, Lee.

380
00:23:32,221 --> 00:23:34,730
The ring has to stay
in the family, Charlie.

381
00:23:36,254 --> 00:23:37,254
So, please...

382
00:23:38,815 --> 00:23:39,815
Take it.

383
00:23:41,191 --> 00:23:42,906
Mum would have wanted it this way.

384
00:23:43,503 --> 00:23:45,540
Pass it on to your little one someday.

385
00:23:46,242 --> 00:23:47,933
I need to know it's safe.

386
00:23:55,177 --> 00:23:56,415
I'll hold on to it...

387
00:23:59,702 --> 00:24:00,865
but I won't take it.

388
00:24:04,787 --> 00:24:06,627
Hey, it fits. Look at that.

389
00:24:09,052 --> 00:24:10,460
Happy christmas, baby brother.

390
00:24:42,254 --> 00:24:43,299
You need some help?

391
00:24:45,194 --> 00:24:47,328
Why didn't you tell me
you were gonna do this?

392
00:24:53,058 --> 00:24:54,432
I didn't want you to worry.

393
00:24:56,049 --> 00:24:57,570
Well, it's dangerous, isn't it,

394
00:24:57,714 --> 00:24:59,713
swimming into some underwater station?

395
00:25:00,412 --> 00:25:03,285
It's what needs to be done
to get us all rescued.

396
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:07,046
I'll be fine, Claire.

397
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:10,029
But you gotta promise me something.

398
00:25:11,799 --> 00:25:12,816
While I'm gone...

399
00:25:16,319 --> 00:25:17,579
Don't worry about me.

400
00:25:30,852 --> 00:25:31,897
I'll take him.

401
00:25:34,832 --> 00:25:35,832
Thanks.

402
00:25:42,545 --> 00:25:43,827
Alright, turnip head.

403
00:25:45,773 --> 00:25:47,504
Now you take care of your mum

404
00:25:48,513 --> 00:25:49,739
while I'm away, okay?

405
00:25:59,643 --> 00:26:00,643
I love you.

406
00:26:20,454 --> 00:26:21,487
See you soon.

407
00:26:25,467 --> 00:26:26,630
Be careful, Charlie.

408
00:26:27,932 --> 00:26:28,958
Okay?

409
00:27:22,591 --> 00:27:23,726
Sorry, guys.

410
00:27:24,083 --> 00:27:25,156
Thanks, man.

411
00:27:35,411 --> 00:27:37,682
Help! Help me!

412
00:27:41,313 --> 00:27:42,403
Please!

413
00:27:44,614 --> 00:27:45,624
You, stop!

414
00:27:46,373 --> 00:27:47,986
Get the hell away from her!

415
00:27:49,014 --> 00:27:50,017
What are you doing?

416
00:27:50,139 --> 00:27:51,139
Leave her alone!

417
00:27:54,390 --> 00:27:55,390
You okay, miss?

418
00:27:55,951 --> 00:27:57,936
Yes. I think so, yes.

419
00:28:00,327 --> 00:28:01,327
Here you go.

420
00:28:02,968 --> 00:28:04,516
Pardon me while I have a heart attack.

421
00:28:04,638 --> 00:28:06,872
The last time I was in a fight,
I was 8 years old.

422
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:11,139
And I lost.

423
00:28:12,356 --> 00:28:15,762
Well, that makes you even more
of a hero, doesn't it?

424
00:28:16,638 --> 00:28:18,122
I just did what anyone would do.

425
00:28:18,833 --> 00:28:21,172
Three people walked by the alley.

426
00:28:22,201 --> 00:28:23,303
- What?
- They saw me,

427
00:28:24,053 --> 00:28:25,460
but they just kept on going.

428
00:28:28,139 --> 00:28:29,732
You are a hero, sir...

429
00:28:31,326 --> 00:28:34,385
And don't let anyone ever
tell you differently.

430
00:28:50,642 --> 00:28:52,474
- What's that?
- It's a weight belt.

431
00:28:53,016 --> 00:28:55,360
It should bring you down
quicker than swimming.

432
00:28:56,754 --> 00:28:58,276
Well, every second counts.

433
00:29:00,078 --> 00:29:02,080
So I just take it off when I hit bottom,

434
00:29:02,643 --> 00:29:04,356
swim up through the moon pool,

435
00:29:04,701 --> 00:29:05,894
into the station,

436
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:10,658
swim into whichever room
has the yellow blinking switch,

437
00:29:12,157 --> 00:29:13,235
flip it.

438
00:29:15,611 --> 00:29:16,635
Nothing to it.

439
00:29:21,334 --> 00:29:24,429
So how long
can you really hold your breath for?

440
00:29:26,510 --> 00:29:27,640
Does it matter?

441
00:29:35,505 --> 00:29:38,276
- Do you want me to hit another one?
- No, you've made your point.

442
00:29:38,505 --> 00:29:41,568
Bernard, this is not pheasant hunting
in Montgomery county.

443
00:29:41,690 --> 00:29:43,323
- I know what I'm doing.
- No.

444
00:29:43,445 --> 00:29:46,398
- Pheasants don't shoot back.
- Nothing's gonna happen to me, Rose.

445
00:29:46,692 --> 00:29:49,950
I just have to shoot a tent,
and I'll be right behind you.

446
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:51,600
Then I'm staying, too.

447
00:29:52,455 --> 00:29:53,567
No, you're not, Rose.

448
00:29:55,713 --> 00:29:58,074
Everyone's gathering down
at the south end of the beach.

449
00:29:58,651 --> 00:30:00,336
No one's staying behind
but the shooters.

450
00:30:00,467 --> 00:30:02,589
Says who? You wanna give me your word

451
00:30:02,711 --> 00:30:05,619
that nothing's gonna happen
to my husband, then I'll go.

452
00:30:07,832 --> 00:30:09,943
I'll give you my word
that if we don't kill everyone

453
00:30:10,065 --> 00:30:11,826
who shows up here in about an hour,

454
00:30:12,137 --> 00:30:14,022
it's not gonna matter where Bernard is.

455
00:30:15,427 --> 00:30:17,641
I like you better
since you got back, Jack.

456
00:30:18,007 --> 00:30:19,540
You're almost an optimist.

457
00:30:20,426 --> 00:30:22,758
Come on.
If you're gonna be hiding in the bushes,

458
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:24,522
let's get you into somethin' dark.

459
00:30:28,566 --> 00:30:29,796
You better get going.

460
00:30:30,506 --> 00:30:32,965
Rousseau says it's about
a day's walk up to the radio tower.

461
00:30:33,087 --> 00:30:35,358
I'm not taking them to the tower.
You are.

462
00:30:37,542 --> 00:30:39,818
- Excuse me?
- You're not staying behind.

463
00:30:41,194 --> 00:30:42,342
This was my idea.

464
00:30:42,464 --> 00:30:44,204
And I'm perfectly capable
of executing it.

465
00:30:44,326 --> 00:30:46,647
- I owe them!
- What are you more concerned with,

466
00:30:47,312 --> 00:30:50,275
killing the others
or getting our people off this island?

467
00:30:52,945 --> 00:30:55,098
This afternoon,
you said you were our leader.

468
00:31:00,067 --> 00:31:01,698
It's time for you to act like one.

469
00:31:06,505 --> 00:31:08,560
Lead them to the radio tower, Jack...

470
00:31:10,741 --> 00:31:12,263
and then take us all home.

471
00:31:23,647 --> 00:31:25,191
Dudes, wait!

472
00:31:30,185 --> 00:31:32,430
I heard what you're doing.
I wanna come with.

473
00:31:35,703 --> 00:31:38,643
Everyone...
They're all going to the radio tower,

474
00:31:39,630 --> 00:31:43,220
and I'm sick of trekking and,
you know, explosions.

475
00:31:44,752 --> 00:31:46,432
I think I can help you guys out.

476
00:31:47,438 --> 00:31:48,880
I'm a really good paddler.

477
00:31:55,379 --> 00:31:56,545
You can't go, Hurley.

478
00:31:58,424 --> 00:31:59,506
Why not?

479
00:32:02,069 --> 00:32:03,069
Because...

480
00:32:05,663 --> 00:32:06,764
you're too big.

481
00:32:08,053 --> 00:32:09,494
You won't fit in the boat.

482
00:32:17,390 --> 00:32:18,559
That's uncool, man.

483
00:32:21,584 --> 00:32:22,719
Wait.

484
00:32:27,287 --> 00:32:29,955
Dude, it's fine. I don't even
wanna go on your stupid boat.

485
00:32:36,237 --> 00:32:37,611
I'll catch up with you later.

486
00:32:38,618 --> 00:32:39,821
Just remember I love you, man.

487
00:32:40,881 --> 00:32:42,346
Yeah, whatever. I love you, too.

488
00:32:58,769 --> 00:33:00,459
You got water in there? Good, good.

489
00:33:01,048 --> 00:33:02,411
How about you? Bottled water?

490
00:33:02,858 --> 00:33:03,880
Good.

491
00:33:08,437 --> 00:33:09,723
So here we go again, huh?

492
00:33:11,563 --> 00:33:12,614
Here we go again.

493
00:33:16,248 --> 00:33:17,997
The tents are all marked. We're set.

494
00:33:18,924 --> 00:33:20,416
Sayid find the third shooter?

495
00:33:31,955 --> 00:33:33,928
Ready, Claire?
Need a hand with the little guy?

496
00:33:34,452 --> 00:33:35,781
No, thanks. I'm okay.

497
00:33:43,450 --> 00:33:45,057
How's my little sweetheart?

498
00:33:48,427 --> 00:33:51,318
We're just gonna go for a little walk,
so hold onto mum, okay?

499
00:34:15,589 --> 00:34:16,662
This is it!

500
00:34:24,735 --> 00:34:25,786
Ready?

501
00:35:41,201 --> 00:35:42,404
Do you want a blanket?

502
00:35:43,014 --> 00:35:44,332
Oh, thanks. I've got one.

503
00:35:45,644 --> 00:35:47,029
Well, you're warming for two.

504
00:35:47,424 --> 00:35:48,475
Take mine.

505
00:35:50,844 --> 00:35:51,888
Thank you.

506
00:36:00,624 --> 00:36:03,472
So... first plane crash?

507
00:36:04,899 --> 00:36:05,913
What gave it away?

508
00:36:06,513 --> 00:36:08,466
Ah, you can always spot the newbies.

509
00:36:13,694 --> 00:36:15,306
We're gonna be okay, you know.

510
00:36:17,350 --> 00:36:18,412
Are we?

511
00:36:19,349 --> 00:36:20,349
We're alive.

512
00:36:21,138 --> 00:36:22,727
We're on a beautiful island.

513
00:36:23,862 --> 00:36:25,287
We'll sleep under the stars,

514
00:36:25,807 --> 00:36:28,682
and before you know it, the helicopters
will come and take us all home.

515
00:36:30,709 --> 00:36:32,196
You really think they'll find us?

516
00:36:33,582 --> 00:36:35,035
Well, yeah. Why wouldn't they?

517
00:36:38,053 --> 00:36:39,149
Thanks.

518
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:42,685
I'm Charlie.

519
00:36:43,021 --> 00:36:44,110
I'm Claire.

520
00:36:44,747 --> 00:36:46,064
Nice to meet you, Charlie.

521
00:36:46,545 --> 00:36:47,737
It's nice to meet you.

522
00:37:09,441 --> 00:37:10,656
We're here.

523
00:37:21,595 --> 00:37:23,329
I want you to give this
to Claire for me.

524
00:37:30,034 --> 00:37:31,034
What is it?

525
00:37:36,281 --> 00:37:38,225
It's the five best moments of my...

526
00:37:40,046 --> 00:37:41,443
sorry excuse for a life.

527
00:37:44,953 --> 00:37:46,158
My greatest hits.

528
00:37:52,155 --> 00:37:53,155
You know...

529
00:37:56,783 --> 00:37:57,783
memories...

530
00:37:59,622 --> 00:38:00,718
are all I've got.

531
00:38:03,136 --> 00:38:04,318
You don't have to do this.

532
00:38:06,136 --> 00:38:07,146
What?

533
00:38:09,155 --> 00:38:10,155
I'll go.

534
00:38:11,352 --> 00:38:12,913
No, your... Your flashes...

535
00:38:13,125 --> 00:38:14,130
Maybe...

536
00:38:14,992 --> 00:38:17,011
I keep seeing you die because...

537
00:38:19,598 --> 00:38:21,256
I'm supposed to take your place.

538
00:38:27,136 --> 00:38:28,385
What about your girl...

539
00:38:29,237 --> 00:38:30,344
Penny?

540
00:38:32,571 --> 00:38:33,774
What about your girl?

541
00:38:38,487 --> 00:38:39,594
Besides...

542
00:38:43,978 --> 00:38:45,349
I might be luckier than you.

543
00:38:55,853 --> 00:38:57,340
Keep your memories to yourself.

544
00:39:01,396 --> 00:39:02,668
I'll take it from here.

545
00:39:10,771 --> 00:39:12,031
I don't know what to say.

546
00:39:15,634 --> 00:39:18,335
Well, you can tell me where the,
the weight belt is.

547
00:39:19,698 --> 00:39:20,958
Right there behind you.

548
00:39:47,292 --> 00:39:48,586
You and I both know...

549
00:39:49,868 --> 00:39:51,820
You aren't supposed
to take my place, brother.

550
00:41:56,613 --> 00:41:57,845
I'm alive.
