00:00:00,745 --> 00:00:02,084
<i>Previously on</i> Lost...

2
00:00:02,260 --> 00:00:04,890
There's a rental car parked out front.
Got to Sue city.

3
00:00:04,978 --> 00:00:07,644
I want you to check in
at the Sage Flower motel.

4
00:00:07,794 --> 00:00:10,154
Wait for me. I'll be there in the a.m.

5
00:00:10,276 --> 00:00:11,281
I love you.

6
00:00:11,388 --> 00:00:12,624
I love you, too.

7
00:00:22,206 --> 00:00:23,557
I don't care what Jack said.

8
00:00:23,608 --> 00:00:26,097
They've got him, and we have
to get him back. I owe him that.

9
00:00:26,136 --> 00:00:27,851
Obviously,
the circumstances have changed.

10
00:00:27,852 --> 00:00:29,263
He may not want to be rescued.

11
00:00:29,281 --> 00:00:32,039
If he's shaking hands with the others,
I'm sure he has a good reason.

12
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:34,479
We came here to rescue Jack,
and that's what we're gonna do.

13
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:36,477
What are you doing here?

14
00:00:36,478 --> 00:00:37,478
I came to get you.

15
00:00:37,791 --> 00:00:38,791
Get outta here.

16
00:00:39,408 --> 00:00:40,508
Don't hurt her!

17
00:00:42,364 --> 00:00:43,638
I made a deal with them.

18
00:00:44,035 --> 00:00:45,368
They're gonna let me go.

19
00:00:46,033 --> 00:00:47,033
Where?

20
00:00:47,295 --> 00:00:48,317
Home.

21
00:00:49,970 --> 00:00:51,412
Jack, we need to go.

22
00:00:54,644 --> 00:00:56,032
Hey, hold it right there!

23
00:00:56,083 --> 00:00:58,037
Get your hands up! Get down!

24
00:00:58,394 --> 00:00:59,473
I said get down!

25
00:01:00,396 --> 00:01:01,708
What are you doing here, John?

26
00:01:01,709 --> 00:01:02,709
I'm sorry, Jack.

27
00:01:02,831 --> 00:01:03,831
Sorry for what?

28
00:01:54,413 --> 00:01:56,535
I was just bringing you
something to eat.

29
00:01:59,942 --> 00:02:01,053
Enjoy your sandwich.

30
00:02:19,892 --> 00:02:21,551
Been on the road a while, huh?

31
00:02:21,754 --> 00:02:23,198
How long is it gonna take?

32
00:02:23,625 --> 00:02:25,033
Well, your fan belt's shot.

33
00:02:25,095 --> 00:02:26,754
I'll take two days, maybe three.

34
00:02:28,694 --> 00:02:30,138
Three days for a fan belt?

35
00:02:31,256 --> 00:02:32,256
Welcome to Iowa.

36
00:02:36,867 --> 00:02:37,867
My name is Johnny.

37
00:02:38,742 --> 00:02:39,742
I'm Lucy.

38
00:02:50,513 --> 00:02:52,095
All 18-karat gold.

39
00:02:52,634 --> 00:02:54,795
Cheapest one in retail for 500 bucks.

40
00:02:55,161 --> 00:02:57,283
Come on. Those don't look real.
I'm not buying.

41
00:02:57,321 --> 00:02:58,942
What do you mean, they don't look real?

42
00:02:58,961 --> 00:03:00,330
My uncle's going out of business.

43
00:03:00,678 --> 00:03:03,379
If you need a lift into town,
I'm finished up here in an hour.

44
00:03:03,793 --> 00:03:06,239
- I call the cops.
- Fine. Whatever. Your loss.

45
00:03:06,258 --> 00:03:07,450
Is there a problem, buddy?

46
00:03:07,451 --> 00:03:09,117
Yeah. Yeah, there's a problem.

47
00:03:09,261 --> 00:03:11,205
I'm getting scammed here,
that's the problem.

48
00:03:11,261 --> 00:03:13,447
- Look, I'm sorry.
- What do you think, I'm an idiot?

49
00:03:13,448 --> 00:03:15,382
If you don't want to buy them,
don't buy them.

50
00:03:15,439 --> 00:03:18,314
Those are fake necklaces,
and you're a rip-off artist.

51
00:03:18,449 --> 00:03:19,449
They're real.

52
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:20,882
I call the cops.

53
00:03:21,113 --> 00:03:22,952
You don't want them,
I'll find somebody else.

54
00:03:22,953 --> 00:03:24,066
Hey, let me see those.

55
00:03:26,636 --> 00:03:27,931
My father owns a jewelry store.

56
00:03:27,951 --> 00:03:29,475
I think I can spot a fake.

57
00:03:30,017 --> 00:03:31,052
How much?

58
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:32,760
60 bucks.

59
00:03:32,824 --> 00:03:34,246
I'll take the one on the end.

60
00:03:37,016 --> 00:03:38,075
Whatever.

61
00:03:40,655 --> 00:03:41,694
Thanks.

62
00:03:46,305 --> 00:03:47,636
Can I get my money back?

63
00:03:57,073 --> 00:03:58,073
Why'd you help me?

64
00:03:59,335 --> 00:04:01,611
Just one girl watching
another girl's back, I guess.

65
00:04:02,643 --> 00:04:04,525
Or you're stranded here,

66
00:04:04,704 --> 00:04:07,680
and for some reason, you didn't want
that guy calling the cops.

67
00:04:17,235 --> 00:04:19,499
I'll give you a ride into town.
You buy me a drink.

68
00:04:31,298 --> 00:04:32,378
What?

69
00:04:39,236 --> 00:04:40,291
What are you doing?

70
00:04:41,924 --> 00:04:42,985
Did they capture you?

71
00:04:43,024 --> 00:04:44,110
Yes, but...

72
00:04:45,467 --> 00:04:46,681
Only temporarily.

73
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:50,747
I came to say good-bye.

74
00:04:53,217 --> 00:04:54,217
Good-bye?

75
00:04:54,341 --> 00:04:55,563
I'm leaving with them.

76
00:04:56,546 --> 00:04:57,593
What the hell is going on?

77
00:04:57,594 --> 00:05:00,095
I mean, what are they doing to you?
Are you brainwashed?

78
00:05:00,101 --> 00:05:01,154
Where did Jack go?

79
00:05:01,173 --> 00:05:02,823
Jack didn't go anywhere, Kate.

80
00:05:03,344 --> 00:05:05,466
He's gonna have
to stay behind, like you.

81
00:05:06,655 --> 00:05:07,821
You can't trust them.

82
00:05:08,342 --> 00:05:10,404
If they told you that
they're gonna take you home,

83
00:05:10,405 --> 00:05:12,599
- they're lying...
- I don't want to go home.

84
00:05:14,595 --> 00:05:17,347
I want you to know,
I made a strong case for you.

85
00:05:17,592 --> 00:05:19,510
I told them
that you were a good person...

86
00:05:19,656 --> 00:05:22,174
reliable, smart, honest.

87
00:05:22,682 --> 00:05:25,133
And then they told me
who you were and what you had done.

88
00:05:27,503 --> 00:05:30,011
Let's just say, forgiveness
isn't one of their strong suits.

89
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:36,220
Good luck.

90
00:05:37,739 --> 00:05:38,864
John, where are you going?

91
00:05:38,883 --> 00:05:39,890
Coming out!

92
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:43,676
Where is Jack and where is Sayid?

93
00:05:43,677 --> 00:05:45,470
Have you seen Rousseau?

94
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:53,283
John, please. What's happened to you?

95
00:05:53,676 --> 00:05:54,676
I'm sorry, Kate.

96
00:06:05,435 --> 00:06:14,604
Subtitle: swsub.com

97
00:06:28,081 --> 00:06:29,352
What the hell's wrong with you?

98
00:06:29,410 --> 00:06:31,879
Don't look at me,
and pretend we're not talking.

99
00:06:32,705 --> 00:06:34,078
I'm not supposed to be here.

100
00:06:34,079 --> 00:06:35,079
Good. Then scram.

101
00:06:35,331 --> 00:06:37,777
Dude, you need to know
that there's been some chatter.

102
00:06:38,675 --> 00:06:40,527
After Paulo and Nikki and everything,

103
00:06:41,082 --> 00:06:43,766
Well, tomorrow there's gonna be a vote.

104
00:06:44,402 --> 00:06:45,443
A vote for what?

105
00:06:45,482 --> 00:06:47,691
To decide whether or not to banish you.

106
00:06:48,517 --> 00:06:49,517
Banish me?

107
00:06:50,704 --> 00:06:52,960
- Where?
- Well, there was debate about that,

108
00:06:53,018 --> 00:06:55,922
but the consensus was
half a mile down the beach.

109
00:06:56,589 --> 00:06:57,630
Consensus?

110
00:06:58,330 --> 00:07:01,273
I'm only saying this
because there may be a way to fix it--

111
00:07:01,517 --> 00:07:03,324
to, like, make amends.

112
00:07:05,829 --> 00:07:06,829
I don't do amends.

113
00:07:07,769 --> 00:07:09,068
You might want to ask yourself

114
00:07:09,381 --> 00:07:12,887
about all the good stuff that comes
from being
part of this... society.

115
00:07:14,644 --> 00:07:16,481
I mean, you can't even feed yourself.

116
00:07:16,625 --> 00:07:17,818
You use our latrine,

117
00:07:18,589 --> 00:07:21,560
drink the water that Steve brings
every morning to the trough...

118
00:07:21,644 --> 00:07:22,644
What?

119
00:07:22,707 --> 00:07:27,665
You know how for 3 days, 10 h and 15 min
I ain't allowed to use nicknames?

120
00:07:28,453 --> 00:07:34,009
Well, you, sir... Hugo,
are rotund,

121
00:07:34,892 --> 00:07:35,892
annoying,

122
00:07:36,204 --> 00:07:37,981
and you're ruining my damn view.

123
00:07:38,393 --> 00:07:39,502
How's that for amends?

124
00:07:40,831 --> 00:07:42,345
You're making a big mistake, dude.

125
00:07:45,268 --> 00:07:46,268
Banish me...

126
00:09:15,929 --> 00:09:17,627
How about you tell me your name?

127
00:09:18,989 --> 00:09:21,168
- It's Lucy.
- And what's your real name?

128
00:09:22,209 --> 00:09:24,215
Next time somebody asks,
you don't think about it.

129
00:09:24,239 --> 00:09:26,603
- I didn't think--
- Not even for a second.

130
00:09:27,935 --> 00:09:29,304
So why Lucy?

131
00:09:30,052 --> 00:09:31,052
She's a saint.

132
00:09:31,338 --> 00:09:33,229
I had to memorize them all
in Sunday's school,

133
00:09:33,267 --> 00:09:35,675
so I figure they're probably still
rattling around my brain.

134
00:09:35,676 --> 00:09:38,403
What makes a girl who went
to Sunday school scared of cops?

135
00:09:46,490 --> 00:09:48,824
A few months ago,
I killed my stepfather.

136
00:09:48,987 --> 00:09:51,418
I escaped from the marshal
who arrested me for it.

137
00:09:54,927 --> 00:09:55,927
Why?

138
00:09:58,628 --> 00:10:00,009
'cause he was a bad guy.

139
00:10:03,926 --> 00:10:04,960
So...

140
00:10:05,733 --> 00:10:07,696
what the hell are you doing in Iowa?

141
00:10:09,301 --> 00:10:10,651
I want to talk to my mother.

142
00:10:15,163 --> 00:10:17,458
You're gonna have
a really hard time doing that,

143
00:10:17,601 --> 00:10:19,632
because if you did
what you just said you did,

144
00:10:20,086 --> 00:10:22,497
the feds are gonna be watching her 24/7.

145
00:10:22,966 --> 00:10:23,996
I'll figure something out.

146
00:10:24,224 --> 00:10:26,722
- Oh, you will, huh?
- What, you want to help me?

147
00:10:33,661 --> 00:10:34,661
Absolutely.

148
00:10:36,974 --> 00:10:37,974
Why?

149
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:45,298
I fell in love with the wrong guy,

150
00:10:46,537 --> 00:10:48,444
and then I gave him my life savings.

151
00:10:50,849 --> 00:10:53,223
He conned me and embarrassed me.

152
00:10:53,832 --> 00:10:55,136
He was a bad guy.

153
00:10:57,536 --> 00:10:58,536
So...

154
00:10:58,786 --> 00:11:02,121
I'll help you get the meeting
with your mom... Lucy,

155
00:11:03,075 --> 00:11:05,371
because one of us
deserves something good.

156
00:12:22,099 --> 00:12:23,987
I ain't gonna get the Korean vote...

157
00:12:37,221 --> 00:12:39,015
Come on, come on!

158
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,031
Hey, let's do it!

159
00:13:06,937 --> 00:13:07,937
Do what?

160
00:13:08,875 --> 00:13:11,196
I'm ready to do it: make amends,

161
00:13:11,617 --> 00:13:12,682
change the vote.

162
00:13:14,687 --> 00:13:16,464
I don't wanna be banished, okay?

163
00:13:16,732 --> 00:13:17,748
You happy?

164
00:13:18,687 --> 00:13:19,742
Dude, you stink.

165
00:13:20,937 --> 00:13:21,992
What is that, fish?

166
00:13:24,491 --> 00:13:26,247
Did you try to gut one yourself?

167
00:13:27,874 --> 00:13:29,541
How have you not learned that by now?

168
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:31,715
I mean, we've been here, like,
three months.

169
00:13:32,063 --> 00:13:33,285
Could we just do this?

170
00:13:33,687 --> 00:13:34,687
Do what?

171
00:13:36,437 --> 00:13:37,444
Make nice?

172
00:13:39,251 --> 00:13:41,569
Apologize for calling me
all those names.

173
00:13:45,189 --> 00:13:47,527
I'm really sorry I called you "rotund."

174
00:13:49,212 --> 00:13:51,836
- Really?
- You're worse than a girl.

175
00:13:52,564 --> 00:13:55,111
Come on. Let's spread the love.

176
00:14:27,984 --> 00:14:29,288
What the hell am I doing here?

177
00:14:29,289 --> 00:14:31,078
- Why don't you tell me?
- I don't know.

178
00:14:31,145 --> 00:14:32,161
I don't know either!

179
00:14:32,162 --> 00:14:34,282
So, why don't you let go of my wrist?

180
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:58,405
So what the hell happened?

181
00:15:00,222 --> 00:15:01,785
I was making a cup of tea.

182
00:15:02,726 --> 00:15:04,759
Canister came in through the window.

183
00:15:06,974 --> 00:15:08,642
So what'd you do to piss them off?

184
00:15:10,968 --> 00:15:12,356
You're wasting your time.

185
00:15:12,968 --> 00:15:14,134
The knife is too big.

186
00:15:14,591 --> 00:15:16,280
We need something smaller.
A safety pin...

187
00:15:16,281 --> 00:15:18,725
- We're going back.
- What?

188
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,843
They did this to us.
Why would we go back?

189
00:15:20,923 --> 00:15:23,237
You say "they"
like you didn't lock me in a cage

190
00:15:23,314 --> 00:15:24,926
and watch me break rocks all day.

191
00:15:30,154 --> 00:15:32,114
We're going back to your village because

192
00:15:32,719 --> 00:15:35,038
my friends were probably gassed,
just like us.

193
00:15:35,594 --> 00:15:36,724
Your people are gone anyway.

194
00:15:37,154 --> 00:15:39,182
- I saw them all pack up and leave.
- What?

195
00:15:39,907 --> 00:15:41,740
Locke came to me to say good-bye.

196
00:15:42,773 --> 00:15:44,625
They were taking off,
going somewhere else.

197
00:15:44,664 --> 00:15:45,898
Going? Going where?

198
00:15:46,067 --> 00:15:47,842
He didn't exactly tell me.

199
00:15:51,718 --> 00:15:54,769
Welcome to the wonderful world
of not knowing what the hell's going on.

200
00:16:25,412 --> 00:16:26,529
On the ground!

201
00:16:27,218 --> 00:16:29,089
Get down! On the ground!

202
00:16:29,503 --> 00:16:31,066
Let me see those hands!

203
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:34,557
Let me see those hands!

204
00:16:36,457 --> 00:16:38,020
Long time no see, Austen.

205
00:16:45,602 --> 00:16:47,922
- Who the hell are you?
- I'm just selling bibles!

206
00:17:18,825 --> 00:17:19,904
Hi.

207
00:17:22,785 --> 00:17:24,599
They questioned me for half an hour.

208
00:17:25,341 --> 00:17:26,693
He confiscated my case.

209
00:17:27,333 --> 00:17:29,668
He was asking me about
selling bibles and...

210
00:17:30,328 --> 00:17:32,296
It's a good thing I know how to lie.

211
00:17:32,366 --> 00:17:34,392
Yeah, now we know
what we're up against, right?

212
00:17:34,411 --> 00:17:35,528
Yeah, now we know

213
00:17:35,547 --> 00:17:38,597
that there were six guys
waiting to take you down, Lucy

214
00:17:38,729 --> 00:17:40,485
Yeah, it's okay. I'll figure it out.

215
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:43,418
Figure it out? That marshal...

216
00:17:44,156 --> 00:17:45,669
I don't know what you did to him,

217
00:17:45,718 --> 00:17:48,981
but if he ever gets his hands on you,
it is gonna be you or him.

218
00:17:49,058 --> 00:17:50,890
Look, if you've changed your mind,

219
00:17:51,028 --> 00:17:52,962
if you don't wanna help me, I get it.

220
00:17:53,005 --> 00:17:54,153
No, I do wanna help you,

221
00:17:54,154 --> 00:17:56,739
but if I'm lying to federal agents,
Lucy,

222
00:17:56,779 --> 00:17:58,966
so that you can have
a chat with your mom...

223
00:17:59,959 --> 00:18:02,799
then I at least need to know
that there's a pretty good reason.

224
00:18:06,868 --> 00:18:07,881
He...

225
00:18:08,428 --> 00:18:09,878
He... used to get drunk

226
00:18:10,524 --> 00:18:13,727
and beat up my mom,
so I blew up his house.

227
00:18:14,717 --> 00:18:15,717
I...

228
00:18:16,654 --> 00:18:18,253
Made it look like an accident...

229
00:18:19,777 --> 00:18:20,954
a gas leak.

230
00:18:22,529 --> 00:18:24,973
Took out an insurance policy
on the house...

231
00:18:25,591 --> 00:18:26,591
for her.

232
00:18:27,718 --> 00:18:28,829
Set her up for life.

233
00:18:32,779 --> 00:18:34,332
And then she gave me up.

234
00:18:37,345 --> 00:18:38,404
Chose him over me.

235
00:18:41,834 --> 00:18:43,783
So the reason
I need to talk to her is...

236
00:18:45,056 --> 00:18:46,503
someone I love...

237
00:18:47,091 --> 00:18:50,814
Someone who's supposed
to care about me betrayed me,

238
00:18:52,155 --> 00:18:53,471
and I wanna know why.

239
00:18:57,029 --> 00:18:58,029
Well...

240
00:18:59,218 --> 00:19:00,495
then let's go find out.

241
00:19:06,477 --> 00:19:07,584
What are you doing?

242
00:19:08,547 --> 00:19:10,368
Whoever dragged us out here
left a trail.

243
00:19:10,369 --> 00:19:12,119
It'll lead us back to where
we came from.

244
00:19:12,235 --> 00:19:13,335
Let's go.

245
00:19:14,176 --> 00:19:15,392
It's gonna rain.

246
00:19:15,458 --> 00:19:17,349
Don't you think
we should wait till morning?

247
00:19:29,312 --> 00:19:30,312
Why?

248
00:19:30,624 --> 00:19:31,624
Why what?

249
00:19:31,938 --> 00:19:33,502
Why would they handcuff you to me

250
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:35,723
and then drag us all the way
out into the jungle?

251
00:19:35,939 --> 00:19:37,661
Ben has a thing for mind games.

252
00:19:39,462 --> 00:19:41,180
Is that why he left you behind?

253
00:19:41,438 --> 00:19:42,882
Do we really have to talk?

254
00:19:44,065 --> 00:19:45,065
Nope.

255
00:19:52,510 --> 00:19:54,690
Come on.
If the trail gets wet, I'll lose it.

256
00:19:54,768 --> 00:19:58,279
I hope you're not dragging me
all the way back there with you for him.

257
00:19:59,875 --> 00:20:02,916
- Excuse me?
- I hope you're not going back for Jack,

258
00:20:04,127 --> 00:20:06,383
because I was standing right there

259
00:20:06,689 --> 00:20:09,138
when he told you not to come back,

260
00:20:09,395 --> 00:20:12,559
and now that you've ruined his
chance to get off the island...

261
00:20:26,218 --> 00:20:27,374
You done?

262
00:20:28,938 --> 00:20:30,379
I said, are you done?

263
00:20:36,338 --> 00:20:38,556
I... I'm sorry. I didn't mean to...

264
00:20:43,206 --> 00:20:44,662
What the hell was that?

265
00:20:55,074 --> 00:20:57,554
- Get up!
- You dislocated my shoulder!

266
00:20:59,432 --> 00:21:00,432
Come on!

267
00:21:07,757 --> 00:21:08,954
Wait! Come here.

268
00:21:12,108 --> 00:21:14,384
Okay. Get down.

269
00:21:15,446 --> 00:21:16,584
What the hell...

270
00:22:05,189 --> 00:22:06,306
Are we safe?

271
00:22:07,274 --> 00:22:08,354
You tell me.

272
00:22:21,081 --> 00:22:22,794
I ain't kissing no damn baby.

273
00:22:22,868 --> 00:22:24,624
Claire's, like, really influential.

274
00:22:24,678 --> 00:22:26,804
If she votes for you to stay,
you're home free, dude.

275
00:22:26,805 --> 00:22:28,448
Why wouldn't she vote for me?

276
00:22:28,743 --> 00:22:30,742
It's not like I ever done
anything bad to her.

277
00:22:30,743 --> 00:22:33,499
Nah, but you never did
anything good for her either.

278
00:22:33,930 --> 00:22:36,061
And have you ever
even asked how Aaron is?

279
00:22:36,806 --> 00:22:38,365
I know how he is.

280
00:22:39,349 --> 00:22:40,753
He cries loud, and he smells.

281
00:22:40,848 --> 00:22:42,618
You see? That's what I'm talking about.

282
00:22:42,657 --> 00:22:44,335
You're sarcastic.
People don't like that.

283
00:22:44,370 --> 00:22:45,379
All right.

284
00:22:46,131 --> 00:22:47,291
So I go over...

285
00:22:48,430 --> 00:22:49,489
And do what?

286
00:22:50,557 --> 00:22:52,971
Moms love it when you show
an interest in their babies.

287
00:22:53,954 --> 00:22:57,658
So go over there,
say something nice, call her "Claire".

288
00:22:58,432 --> 00:22:59,432
And give her this.

289
00:23:00,867 --> 00:23:02,367
I know you can do it, dude.

290
00:23:08,428 --> 00:23:09,566
Hey, Claire.

291
00:23:13,244 --> 00:23:15,347
Hey there... little baby...

292
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:17,929
Aaron.

293
00:23:21,227 --> 00:23:23,635
Is there anything I can do for you?

294
00:23:23,749 --> 00:23:25,476
No. I just came by...

295
00:23:26,032 --> 00:23:27,289
to see your baby.

296
00:23:32,102 --> 00:23:34,640
He's not as wrinkly
as he was a couple weeks ago.

297
00:23:40,858 --> 00:23:43,829
Yeah, I... guess he's not. Thanks.

298
00:23:45,856 --> 00:23:47,727
Oh, and... this is for you.

299
00:23:49,761 --> 00:23:51,390
- Thank you.
- I don't like...

300
00:23:53,435 --> 00:23:54,573
blankets.

301
00:23:56,595 --> 00:23:57,714
Well, good night.

302
00:23:58,164 --> 00:23:59,164
Good night.

303
00:24:10,052 --> 00:24:11,421
Do you think it's gone?

304
00:24:11,914 --> 00:24:14,588
- Are we safe?
- Are you serious?

305
00:24:14,893 --> 00:24:16,533
- What?
- You've never seen that?

306
00:24:16,572 --> 00:24:17,606
If you don't believe me,

307
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:20,102
you can always pull
my other shoulder out of its socket.

308
00:24:21,484 --> 00:24:24,243
- I was... I wasn't trying to...
- Don't flatter yourself.

309
00:24:24,339 --> 00:24:26,673
This is the fourth time
it's been dislocated.

310
00:24:39,582 --> 00:24:40,817
Give me your hand.

311
00:24:41,978 --> 00:24:43,915
- Why?
- 'cause I want you to pop it back in.

312
00:24:43,916 --> 00:24:45,480
- No, I'm not gonna--
- You're gonna.

313
00:24:45,788 --> 00:24:47,004
Right, now it feels

314
00:24:47,293 --> 00:24:51,364
like there's broken glass under my skin,
and if it weren't for you,

315
00:24:52,346 --> 00:24:54,415
I would be on my way home right now.

316
00:24:54,416 --> 00:24:56,564
Jack told me
not to come back to protect me,

317
00:24:56,976 --> 00:24:59,087
because he didn't want me to get hurt.

318
00:25:01,416 --> 00:25:03,745
- Is that what you think?
- Yeah, that's what I think.

319
00:25:05,231 --> 00:25:07,952
We have cameras on the cages, Kate...

320
00:25:09,726 --> 00:25:10,726
all of them.

321
00:25:11,975 --> 00:25:12,975
He saw you...

322
00:25:13,615 --> 00:25:15,602
you and Sawyer.

323
00:25:17,225 --> 00:25:20,369
The reason Jack told you
not to come back

324
00:25:21,350 --> 00:25:24,147
wasn't because
he didn't want you to get hurt.

325
00:25:25,719 --> 00:25:28,613
It was because you broke his heart.

326
00:25:31,852 --> 00:25:32,852
So...

327
00:25:34,033 --> 00:25:35,308
grab my wrist,

328
00:25:35,499 --> 00:25:37,486
push up and twist.

329
00:25:58,093 --> 00:26:00,119
Why do we gotta be out here
so damn early?

330
00:26:00,251 --> 00:26:02,329
You asked me to help you
catch a boar.

331
00:26:03,437 --> 00:26:05,825
Well, this is when they break
cover to eat.

332
00:26:07,562 --> 00:26:09,684
Looks like they picked
a day to sleep in.

333
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:11,541
So what's your angle, brother?

334
00:26:12,499 --> 00:26:14,159
- My angle?
- Well, you...

335
00:26:15,014 --> 00:26:16,946
Haven't spoken three words to me,
and then...

336
00:26:17,903 --> 00:26:19,755
suddenly you want to be
my hunting partner.

337
00:26:21,187 --> 00:26:22,187
My angle...

338
00:26:23,187 --> 00:26:25,518
is I got hearts and minds to change,

339
00:26:26,062 --> 00:26:28,290
and politics is all about bribes.

340
00:26:30,498 --> 00:26:32,974
Since money don't mean
squat on this island,

341
00:26:34,249 --> 00:26:36,626
I gotta give the people
something they like...

342
00:26:37,997 --> 00:26:39,568
And people like meat.

343
00:27:03,375 --> 00:27:04,486
How's your shoulder?

344
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:08,665
- Awesome.
- Then let's get going.

345
00:27:20,499 --> 00:27:21,499
Thank you.

346
00:27:22,501 --> 00:27:24,001
You're welcome, sweetheart.

347
00:27:41,442 --> 00:27:44,165
Oh, my god! I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

348
00:27:44,189 --> 00:27:45,948
- No worries.
- I'm such an idiot.

349
00:27:46,094 --> 00:27:48,004
It happens all the time, sweetheart.

350
00:27:49,381 --> 00:27:50,498
Thank you.

351
00:28:11,623 --> 00:28:12,623
Hi, mom.

352
00:28:15,437 --> 00:28:17,123
What are you doing here, Katherine?

353
00:28:20,936 --> 00:28:21,936
You look good.

354
00:28:23,576 --> 00:28:25,235
I asked you what you were doing here.

355
00:28:30,938 --> 00:28:33,664
I want to know why you
told them what I did to Wayne.

356
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,022
I thought maybe you came because
you wanted to say you were sorry.

357
00:28:42,538 --> 00:28:43,908
I'm not sorry.

358
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,083
He hit you.
He treated you like a dog and you...

359
00:28:49,150 --> 00:28:51,352
You can't help who you love, Katherine.

360
00:28:52,187 --> 00:28:55,052
And for good or bad, I loved him.

361
00:28:56,686 --> 00:28:58,317
And you burnt him alive.

362
00:28:59,187 --> 00:29:01,575
You turned on the gas,
and you lit a match.

363
00:29:01,999 --> 00:29:04,423
You murdered him in cold blood.

364
00:29:07,064 --> 00:29:08,064
I did it for you.

365
00:29:10,721 --> 00:29:12,709
What you did, you did for yourself.

366
00:29:17,427 --> 00:29:18,854
I have to go back to work.

367
00:29:22,015 --> 00:29:23,570
Because you are my daughter,

368
00:29:24,453 --> 00:29:26,579
I'm not gonna tell the two men
sitting at the table

369
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:29,604
who've been following me
for the last month that you are here,

370
00:29:30,486 --> 00:29:32,164
but I swear to god, Katie...

371
00:29:33,346 --> 00:29:34,677
if I ever see you again,

372
00:29:36,641 --> 00:29:38,896
the first thing I will do
is yell for help.

373
00:29:43,461 --> 00:29:44,578
Good-bye.

374
00:30:00,627 --> 00:30:01,980
Did he say that to you?

375
00:30:02,452 --> 00:30:03,452
Sorry?

376
00:30:04,041 --> 00:30:05,355
That I broke his heart.

377
00:30:07,083 --> 00:30:08,142
He didn't have to.

378
00:30:12,767 --> 00:30:14,272
You don't know anything about him.

379
00:30:14,389 --> 00:30:15,666
I know where he was born.

380
00:30:15,878 --> 00:30:17,578
I know what his parents
did for a living.

381
00:30:17,579 --> 00:30:21,443
I know that he was married
and who he was married to.

382
00:30:21,890 --> 00:30:25,085
I know why he got a divorce.
I know how his father died.

383
00:30:26,014 --> 00:30:29,720
I know his height, his weight,
his birthday and his blood type.

384
00:30:32,702 --> 00:30:34,424
What do you know about him, Kate?

385
00:30:40,878 --> 00:30:42,015
Let's go.

386
00:30:50,017 --> 00:30:51,017
Run.

387
00:30:51,077 --> 00:30:52,214
Run!

388
00:31:08,871 --> 00:31:10,549
Get up! Get up!

389
00:31:11,368 --> 00:31:12,680
Run! Run! Come on!

390
00:31:15,432 --> 00:31:16,468
What are you doing?

391
00:31:16,469 --> 00:31:18,558
I know what happens
when you set those things off!

392
00:31:18,577 --> 00:31:19,913
We will go alongside them.

393
00:31:20,009 --> 00:31:22,286
We don't need to!
We can go around there-- off!

394
00:31:23,642 --> 00:31:24,642
Damn it!

395
00:31:35,229 --> 00:31:36,636
You're gonna want to be over here.

396
00:31:39,216 --> 00:31:40,353
Kate, come on!

397
00:32:22,231 --> 00:32:25,979
We don't know what it is, but we know
that it doesn't like our fences.

398
00:32:26,095 --> 00:32:27,368
You had a key!

399
00:32:29,289 --> 00:32:32,125
They left me behind, too.
They gassed me.

400
00:32:32,229 --> 00:32:33,462
I know that you don't care,

401
00:32:33,539 --> 00:32:36,637
but the people I spent
the last three years of my life with

402
00:32:36,727 --> 00:32:38,018
they just left me!

403
00:32:42,428 --> 00:32:43,819
I thought that maybe...

404
00:32:45,289 --> 00:32:48,284
Maybe if I could make you think
that we were in it together...

405
00:32:51,666 --> 00:32:53,617
Maybe I wouldn't get left behind again.

406
00:33:30,851 --> 00:33:31,928
It's delicious!

407
00:33:32,307 --> 00:33:34,573
Just a little Dharma A1 and paprika...

408
00:33:37,359 --> 00:33:39,234
I hope you'll remember
this little barbecue

409
00:33:39,235 --> 00:33:41,085
- at your meeting later.
- Oh, what meeting?

410
00:33:43,797 --> 00:33:45,463
Hurley told me about the vote.

411
00:33:45,548 --> 00:33:48,264
Vote? Since when
did anyone around here vote?

412
00:33:59,745 --> 00:34:00,852
You son of a bitch!

413
00:34:01,872 --> 00:34:03,619
There wasn't ever gonna be no vote.

414
00:34:03,747 --> 00:34:04,747
But...

415
00:34:05,567 --> 00:34:06,824
Wasn't it nice...

416
00:34:07,563 --> 00:34:08,670
Being nice?

417
00:34:08,752 --> 00:34:10,582
You tricked me into being decent?

418
00:34:10,934 --> 00:34:13,263
That's gotta be the lamest con
in the history of cons!

419
00:34:13,321 --> 00:34:14,614
It wasn't a con, dude.

420
00:34:14,749 --> 00:34:17,871
If you're gonna be our temporary leader,
you need to do some damage control.

421
00:34:17,872 --> 00:34:18,931
Leader?

422
00:34:19,383 --> 00:34:20,612
What the hell are you smoking?

423
00:34:20,650 --> 00:34:24,293
Jack's gone. Locke's gone.
Kate and Sayid...

424
00:34:26,434 --> 00:34:27,434
You're all we got.

425
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:29,549
When Paulo and Nikki died,

426
00:34:30,105 --> 00:34:31,389
we all looked to you.

427
00:34:31,704 --> 00:34:33,870
Then again, you totally tried
to steal their diamonds,

428
00:34:33,889 --> 00:34:35,393
but we wanted to look to you.

429
00:34:35,873 --> 00:34:36,880
Look around.

430
00:34:38,236 --> 00:34:39,398
You made everyone happy.

431
00:34:41,678 --> 00:34:42,774
Just for today,

432
00:34:43,430 --> 00:34:44,609
they can eat boar,

433
00:34:44,802 --> 00:34:47,357
laugh and forget
that they're totally screwed.

434
00:34:49,115 --> 00:34:51,473
And you did that for them, dude... You.

435
00:34:54,689 --> 00:34:56,398
And what if I don't want
to be the leader?

436
00:34:57,898 --> 00:34:59,931
Yeah, well, I don't think
Jack wanted to, either.

437
00:35:02,741 --> 00:35:03,852
Sucks for you, dude.

438
00:36:37,108 --> 00:36:39,477
Sayid's in one of those backyards
down there.

439
00:36:39,919 --> 00:36:40,962
I'll go get him.

440
00:36:42,205 --> 00:36:43,372
You should get Jack.

441
00:37:02,611 --> 00:37:04,097
Jack, wake up. It's me.

442
00:37:13,483 --> 00:37:14,483
What happened?

443
00:37:15,984 --> 00:37:16,984
They all left.

444
00:37:18,808 --> 00:37:20,081
All left?

445
00:37:27,072 --> 00:37:29,046
- What?
- Because of me.

446
00:37:31,358 --> 00:37:32,358
I'm so sorry.

447
00:37:34,330 --> 00:37:35,976
I should've listened to you.

448
00:37:36,109 --> 00:37:37,109
I never...

449
00:37:43,905 --> 00:37:45,905
I wanted to come back to help you...

450
00:37:47,657 --> 00:37:49,101
but you didn't need me to.

451
00:37:54,281 --> 00:37:56,146
And now because of me, you can't go...

452
00:38:10,143 --> 00:38:11,280
I'm so sorry.

453
00:38:20,717 --> 00:38:21,717
They just...

454
00:38:23,613 --> 00:38:24,732
Left?

455
00:38:30,336 --> 00:38:31,917
Even Juliet?

456
00:38:39,169 --> 00:38:40,379
No, they left her, too.

457
00:38:44,487 --> 00:38:45,492
Why?

458
00:38:49,995 --> 00:38:51,831
You know her better than I do.

459
00:38:58,850 --> 00:38:59,850
Now what?

460
00:39:05,416 --> 00:39:06,416
Now...

461
00:39:10,288 --> 00:39:11,288
Now we go back.

462
00:39:46,365 --> 00:39:48,851
- Thanks for everything, Cassidy.
- You got it.

463
00:39:52,789 --> 00:39:54,831
So... this guy who ripped you off...

464
00:39:56,225 --> 00:39:58,927
You wanna give me his name,
tell me where I can find him?

465
00:40:00,531 --> 00:40:02,428
You almost got arrested for me, Cassidy.

466
00:40:02,485 --> 00:40:03,566
I wanna help you.

467
00:40:06,366 --> 00:40:07,446
I'm pregnant.

468
00:40:11,289 --> 00:40:13,402
It's his. The baby's his,

469
00:40:14,605 --> 00:40:15,610
and I still love him.

470
00:40:16,226 --> 00:40:18,584
So call the cops. Have him locked up.

471
00:40:18,666 --> 00:40:21,306
Will you ever forgive your mom
for calling the cops?

472
00:40:24,790 --> 00:40:25,790
No, I won't.

473
00:40:35,791 --> 00:40:36,833
Thanks, Lucy.

474
00:40:38,414 --> 00:40:39,414
My name's Kate.

475
00:40:59,662 --> 00:41:00,662
You okay?

476
00:41:01,413 --> 00:41:03,051
Yeah. You?

477
00:41:20,665 --> 00:41:23,246
I've checked all the houses.
Everyone's gone.

478
00:41:24,451 --> 00:41:25,732
No weapons, no trail.

479
00:41:27,136 --> 00:41:29,416
It's like 50 people
disappeared into thin air.

480
00:41:30,950 --> 00:41:32,449
We should take what we can find

481
00:41:32,934 --> 00:41:34,561
and head out while we still got light.

482
00:41:39,513 --> 00:41:40,957
She is not coming with us.

483
00:41:44,698 --> 00:41:45,698
Yes, she is.

484
00:41:46,700 --> 00:41:47,700
Why?

485
00:41:52,330 --> 00:41:54,279
Because they left her behind, too.
