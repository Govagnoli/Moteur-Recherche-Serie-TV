00:00:00,044 --> 00:00:01,467
<i>Previously on</i> Lost...

2
00:00:01,985 --> 00:00:03,312
You stole my kidney.

3
00:00:03,549 --> 00:00:05,715
You need a father, and I need a kidney.

4
00:00:05,988 --> 00:00:06,988
Get over it.

5
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:14,985
I know you were raised in foster care.

6
00:00:15,066 --> 00:00:16,426
I know you spent the four years

7
00:00:16,501 --> 00:00:18,710
prior to your arrival
on this island in a wheelchair,

8
00:00:18,787 --> 00:00:20,634
and I know how you ended up in it.

9
00:00:20,673 --> 00:00:23,136
What if I told you
that somewhere on this island,

10
00:00:23,305 --> 00:00:25,500
there's a very large box,

11
00:00:26,673 --> 00:00:29,817
and whatever you imagined,
whatever you wanted to be in it,

12
00:00:30,774 --> 00:00:34,245
when you opened that box,
there it would be?

13
00:00:34,602 --> 00:00:38,256
I'd say I hope that box is big enough
to imagine yourself up new submarine.

14
00:00:45,999 --> 00:00:48,035
Well, John, you've really gone
and done it now.

15
00:00:48,101 --> 00:00:50,989
You're not gonna start talking about
the magic box again, are you?

16
00:00:51,111 --> 00:00:54,222
No, John. I'm gonna show you
what came out of it.

17
00:00:56,860 --> 00:00:57,860
Dad?

18
00:01:20,737 --> 00:01:21,737
Save your breath.

19
00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:26,051
Nobody's gonna hear you.

20
00:01:41,612 --> 00:01:42,612
Dad?

21
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:48,754
What is this?

22
00:01:48,801 --> 00:01:51,856
You tell me. You brought him here.

23
00:01:52,172 --> 00:01:53,453
I didn't bring him here.

24
00:01:53,547 --> 00:01:56,272
I'd be careful about getting
too close to him, John.

25
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:59,673
Well, where did you find him?
Why did you bring him here?

26
00:01:59,741 --> 00:02:02,105
I've already said... We didn't...

27
00:02:02,176 --> 00:02:03,821
You want me to ask him how he got here?

28
00:02:03,889 --> 00:02:04,906
Be my guest.

29
00:02:10,398 --> 00:02:11,900
I warned you, John.

30
00:02:14,672 --> 00:02:15,879
Don't you know, John?

31
00:02:16,736 --> 00:02:18,878
Don't you know where we are?

32
00:02:24,779 --> 00:02:25,795
What did he mean?

33
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:28,688
I'm afraid we don't have time
to deal with that right now, John.

34
00:02:29,239 --> 00:02:31,381
We're leaving
first thing in the morning, all of us.

35
00:02:31,422 --> 00:02:32,533
Where are you going?

36
00:02:34,549 --> 00:02:36,049
We're going to a new place.

37
00:02:37,547 --> 00:02:39,158
Well, an old place, actually.

38
00:02:41,112 --> 00:02:42,834
Would you like to come with us?

39
00:02:49,175 --> 00:02:50,175
Yes.

40
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,360
Good.

41
00:02:53,487 --> 00:02:56,043
We're holding Kate
a few buildings over from here.

42
00:02:56,299 --> 00:02:57,989
Maybe you'd like to say good-bye.

43
00:03:22,016 --> 00:03:23,363
Hey, where you going?

44
00:03:24,861 --> 00:03:26,971
I can't sleep if I'm not in my own tent.

45
00:03:27,357 --> 00:03:29,918
Fine. Let's go to your tent.

46
00:03:36,486 --> 00:03:38,152
It's nothing personal. It's...

47
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:40,966
old habits, you know?

48
00:03:44,735 --> 00:03:46,075
Fine. Scram.

49
00:03:48,610 --> 00:03:50,221
You want me to walk you home?

50
00:03:51,423 --> 00:03:53,402
It's five tents. I think I'll make it.

51
00:03:54,124 --> 00:03:56,723
Are you sure? I gotta pee anyway.

52
00:03:58,149 --> 00:03:59,810
That is so romantic.

53
00:04:22,675 --> 00:04:24,119
What the hell y'all doin'?

54
00:04:26,237 --> 00:04:27,570
What the hell you doing?

55
00:04:28,173 --> 00:04:29,339
Going to take a leak.

56
00:04:31,111 --> 00:04:32,333
Yeah, well, so are we.

57
00:04:35,862 --> 00:04:37,084
Well, all righty then.

58
00:05:02,362 --> 00:05:03,362
Hello, James.

59
00:05:11,558 --> 00:05:15,208
Subtitles: swsub.com

60
00:05:23,434 --> 00:05:24,989
You wanna zip your pants up?

61
00:05:27,371 --> 00:05:28,933
What the hell are you doing here?

62
00:05:29,032 --> 00:05:30,378
Looking for you, actually.

63
00:05:32,248 --> 00:05:33,608
Okay, Tarzan.

64
00:05:33,683 --> 00:05:35,710
Now that you're back from your
"blow up everything

65
00:05:35,739 --> 00:05:37,315
that could get us off the island" tour,

66
00:05:37,365 --> 00:05:39,761
how 'bout you tell me why
you joined up with the damn enemy?

67
00:05:39,808 --> 00:05:42,528
I didn't join 'em. I infiltrated 'em.

68
00:05:43,497 --> 00:05:45,906
- You're undercover with the others.
- That's right.

69
00:05:45,998 --> 00:05:48,516
Now how 'bout you give me
one reason to believe that?

70
00:05:49,429 --> 00:05:50,498
Because a few hours ago

71
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,809
I snuck into Ben's tent
and kidnapped him.

72
00:05:55,738 --> 00:05:58,419
I tied him up,
dragged him off into the jungle.

73
00:06:00,107 --> 00:06:02,945
And you came all the way back here
to tell me this because...

74
00:06:02,999 --> 00:06:05,265
Because this is the same man
who tortured you,

75
00:06:05,472 --> 00:06:07,110
beat you, humiliated you...

76
00:06:08,558 --> 00:06:10,256
And I want you...

77
00:06:10,797 --> 00:06:12,049
to kill him.

78
00:06:17,488 --> 00:06:19,074
You want him dead, you kill him.

79
00:06:19,186 --> 00:06:20,908
- I'm not a murder.
- Neither am I!

80
00:06:21,498 --> 00:06:23,477
Except for the man you killed in Sydney.

81
00:06:25,559 --> 00:06:27,225
They got files on us, James...

82
00:06:28,436 --> 00:06:29,436
All of us.

83
00:06:31,309 --> 00:06:33,341
Yeah, well,
their files got their facts wrong.

84
00:06:40,308 --> 00:06:42,073
Then I made a mistake coming to you.

85
00:06:48,747 --> 00:06:50,772
Please don't tell anyone
that I was here.

86
00:06:52,058 --> 00:06:53,058
Hey, stop!

87
00:06:53,996 --> 00:06:54,996
I said stop!

88
00:06:58,810 --> 00:06:59,878
Damn it! Wait up!

89
00:07:16,666 --> 00:07:19,390
There. That ought to do it.

90
00:07:19,746 --> 00:07:20,746
Thanks.

91
00:07:21,434 --> 00:07:23,571
That would've taken me hours
to do myself.

92
00:07:24,371 --> 00:07:25,371
Glad I could help.

93
00:07:29,307 --> 00:07:30,307
Don't mind them.

94
00:07:30,556 --> 00:07:32,611
They're all just excited you're here.

95
00:07:32,872 --> 00:07:33,872
Excited?

96
00:07:34,493 --> 00:07:35,993
We've been waiting for you.

97
00:07:37,368 --> 00:07:39,268
John, you got a minute?

98
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:42,036
Ben's asking for you.

99
00:07:43,371 --> 00:07:44,371
Okay.

100
00:07:47,775 --> 00:07:49,985
<i>Ben, it's 6:00 a.m. on saturday morning.</i>

101
00:07:50,085 --> 00:07:52,152
<i>Kwon is pregnant.
The fetus is healthy</i>

102
00:07:52,216 --> 00:07:54,905
<i>and was conceived on island
with her husband.</i>

103
00:07:55,083 --> 00:07:56,612
<i>He was sterile when they got here.</i>

104
00:07:58,619 --> 00:08:00,341
Hello, John. Thanks for coming.

105
00:08:01,937 --> 00:08:02,950
What's that?

106
00:08:02,995 --> 00:08:05,867
Juliet is gathering information for us
at your former camp.

107
00:08:06,873 --> 00:08:09,181
She's determing
if any of the women are pregnant.

108
00:08:09,372 --> 00:08:10,983
Then we're gonna go in and...

109
00:08:11,908 --> 00:08:12,912
take them.

110
00:08:14,555 --> 00:08:15,555
Take them?

111
00:08:17,396 --> 00:08:19,369
This is not the first time
we've done this.

112
00:08:19,432 --> 00:08:21,154
Trust me, no one will get hurt.

113
00:08:23,305 --> 00:08:25,027
Could you pass me that, please?

114
00:08:29,296 --> 00:08:30,319
Thank you.

115
00:08:34,109 --> 00:08:36,877
I believe
I have you to thank for this, John.

116
00:08:37,342 --> 00:08:40,100
- Me?
- A week ago, I couldn't move my toes...

117
00:08:42,621 --> 00:08:44,294
But the minute you showed up,

118
00:08:45,245 --> 00:08:47,713
I started to feel pins and needles.

119
00:08:48,807 --> 00:08:50,626
And this is only the beginning, John.

120
00:08:50,805 --> 00:08:53,120
I can't wait to show you
what this island can do,

121
00:08:54,293 --> 00:08:55,404
but unfortunately,

122
00:08:56,122 --> 00:08:57,553
you're not ready, John.

123
00:09:00,498 --> 00:09:02,619
- No, I'm ready.
- No, John, you're not.

124
00:09:03,862 --> 00:09:05,929
You're still crippled by the memories

125
00:09:06,026 --> 00:09:08,812
of the man you used to be
before you came to this island,

126
00:09:09,372 --> 00:09:10,705
and you'll never be free

127
00:09:10,995 --> 00:09:13,709
until you release
the hold that your father has over you.

128
00:09:16,178 --> 00:09:17,911
Why do you think you brought him here?

129
00:09:20,138 --> 00:09:21,790
The magic box.

130
00:09:22,183 --> 00:09:24,018
Okay, Ben, how about you show me...

131
00:09:24,131 --> 00:09:25,775
"Magic box" is a metaphor, John.

132
00:09:25,993 --> 00:09:28,381
I can't show you anything
until you can show me

133
00:09:28,433 --> 00:09:30,436
that you're ready
and willing to be one of us.

134
00:09:30,743 --> 00:09:34,377
When people join us here on this island,
they need to make a gesture

135
00:09:34,494 --> 00:09:37,237
of free will, of commitment.

136
00:09:39,932 --> 00:09:42,076
That's why
you're gonna have to kill your father.

137
00:10:08,177 --> 00:10:09,209
When did you get back?

138
00:10:10,714 --> 00:10:11,723
Last night.

139
00:10:11,805 --> 00:10:13,282
Well, early this morning.

140
00:10:14,369 --> 00:10:16,524
So... camping, huh?

141
00:10:18,032 --> 00:10:19,477
What were you guys doing out there?

142
00:10:20,555 --> 00:10:22,943
We...
figured we'd explore a bit, you know.

143
00:10:23,058 --> 00:10:25,058
See what was further down the beach.

144
00:10:25,930 --> 00:10:26,930
Male bonding.

145
00:10:27,559 --> 00:10:31,058
Well, next time you go out, sign me up.

146
00:10:31,308 --> 00:10:32,731
Yeah, next time. Sure.

147
00:10:45,127 --> 00:10:46,307
Thanks, Jin.

148
00:10:48,495 --> 00:10:49,606
We have to tell Jack.

149
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:51,806
Yeah, I mean,
shouldn't he check out her wound?

150
00:10:51,896 --> 00:10:54,288
Can you give me your word
that Jack can be trusted?

151
00:10:54,530 --> 00:10:57,740
That he spent ten days with those people
and that nothing happened to him?

152
00:10:57,805 --> 00:10:59,805
And that woman
he's spending all his time with...

153
00:10:59,854 --> 00:11:01,507
- Juliet.
- Aye. Juliet.

154
00:11:01,789 --> 00:11:03,956
Two weeks ago,
she had your friends in cages.

155
00:11:06,245 --> 00:11:07,249
Naomi...

156
00:11:07,419 --> 00:11:09,568
Well, you heard
everything that she said.

157
00:11:10,556 --> 00:11:11,667
If we keep her safe,

158
00:11:13,121 --> 00:11:14,916
she's our way off this island.

159
00:11:16,872 --> 00:11:17,957
So given that,

160
00:11:18,172 --> 00:11:19,432
do you trust Jack,

161
00:11:20,586 --> 00:11:21,609
or don't you?

162
00:11:26,182 --> 00:11:27,182
Right.

163
00:11:28,372 --> 00:11:30,668
So we better bring in
someone we can trust.

164
00:11:40,221 --> 00:11:41,998
You should've put some shoes on.

165
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:43,470
You think?

166
00:11:45,874 --> 00:11:47,193
So what else is in it?

167
00:11:48,346 --> 00:11:49,346
In what?

168
00:11:51,096 --> 00:11:52,429
The file they got on me.

169
00:11:54,094 --> 00:11:55,094
Not much.

170
00:11:56,470 --> 00:11:58,896
That your parents died
when you were very young.

171
00:12:00,036 --> 00:12:01,258
But it doesn't say why

172
00:12:01,784 --> 00:12:03,008
your father...

173
00:12:03,856 --> 00:12:04,988
shot your mother...

174
00:12:08,031 --> 00:12:10,031
or why he turned the gun on himself.

175
00:12:16,158 --> 00:12:17,880
That must've been hard for you.

176
00:12:28,969 --> 00:12:29,969
What else?

177
00:12:30,156 --> 00:12:31,575
High school transcripts...

178
00:12:32,259 --> 00:12:33,345
criminal record...

179
00:12:34,094 --> 00:12:36,260
all the con jobs you were arrested for.

180
00:12:36,783 --> 00:12:39,044
I guess that's why
you use an alias, huh?

181
00:12:39,291 --> 00:12:40,979
Why did you choose the name Sawyer?

182
00:12:42,656 --> 00:12:44,186
How stupid do you think I am?

183
00:12:44,517 --> 00:12:46,169
I already been conned by Ben once.

184
00:12:46,272 --> 00:12:48,842
Maybe you heard about it...
bunny with a number painted on it?

185
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:51,125
You think I'm just gonna follow you
through the jungle?

186
00:12:51,172 --> 00:12:53,152
Please, you have to...
You have to trust me.

187
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:55,076
Where are you taking me?
Tell me the truth!

188
00:12:55,111 --> 00:12:56,115
What do you want from me?

189
00:12:56,162 --> 00:12:58,536
I'm bringing you there
to do exactly what I said...

190
00:12:58,659 --> 00:13:00,966
- To kill Ben.
- Why did you come back to get me?

191
00:13:01,033 --> 00:13:02,371
- I had to.
- Why me?!

192
00:13:02,406 --> 00:13:03,726
Why won't you do it yourself?

193
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:05,716
- James, please...
- Don't call me James!

194
00:13:06,282 --> 00:13:08,143
Why won't you do it yourself?

195
00:13:08,219 --> 00:13:11,267
Because I can't! I can't!
I can't do it!

196
00:13:15,591 --> 00:13:17,299
That's why I came back for you.

197
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:28,219
Get up.

198
00:13:34,407 --> 00:13:35,872
I'll go to wherever you got him,

199
00:13:36,175 --> 00:13:38,061
but then
we're bringing him back to our camp.

200
00:13:38,158 --> 00:13:40,286
I ain't killing nobody.
You understand me?

201
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:43,999
Yeah. I understand...

202
00:13:46,167 --> 00:13:47,588
But you'll change your mind

203
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:54,387
When you hear what he has to say,

204
00:13:56,657 --> 00:13:58,083
you'll change your mind.

205
00:14:15,235 --> 00:14:16,295
Hey, dude.

206
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,110
Hello, Hurley.

207
00:14:30,186 --> 00:14:31,408
Can you keep a secret?

208
00:14:39,689 --> 00:14:41,096
You've already spoken to her?

209
00:14:41,247 --> 00:14:43,944
Yeah, but you're gonna want
to hear it for yourself.

210
00:14:44,307 --> 00:14:45,751
And you haven't told Jack?

211
00:14:46,556 --> 00:14:47,556
No.

212
00:14:47,995 --> 00:14:48,995
Good.

213
00:15:01,402 --> 00:15:02,819
My name's Sayid Jarrah.

214
00:15:03,248 --> 00:15:05,594
I understand your helicopter
crashed onto the island.

215
00:15:05,745 --> 00:15:07,633
Actually, it crashed in the water.

216
00:15:09,058 --> 00:15:10,058
What's your name?

217
00:15:10,432 --> 00:15:12,512
Naomi. Naomi Dorrit.

218
00:15:12,670 --> 00:15:15,372
Naomi, from where exactly
did you take off?

219
00:15:15,806 --> 00:15:17,679
A ship... freighter...

220
00:15:18,185 --> 00:15:20,240
About 80 nautical miles west of here.

221
00:15:20,807 --> 00:15:22,658
I'm part of a search and recovery team.

222
00:15:23,119 --> 00:15:26,563
You told my friends the wreckage
of flight 815 was discovered.

223
00:15:26,996 --> 00:15:28,545
Did you mean the partial wreckage?

224
00:15:28,871 --> 00:15:32,721
No. They found the entire plane
off the coast of Bali,

225
00:15:33,011 --> 00:15:34,788
in an ocean trench 4 miles deep.

226
00:15:35,697 --> 00:15:39,073
They sent down cameras in these
little robots to survey the wreck.

227
00:15:39,948 --> 00:15:41,392
The bodies were all there.

228
00:15:44,823 --> 00:15:47,068
Well, obviously we're not dead.

229
00:15:48,417 --> 00:15:49,496
Obviously.

230
00:15:49,669 --> 00:15:51,283
So if you weren't looking for us,

231
00:15:51,447 --> 00:15:52,887
then who were you looking for?

232
00:15:53,761 --> 00:15:54,761
Him.

233
00:15:57,011 --> 00:15:58,011
Desmond?

234
00:15:58,151 --> 00:16:01,079
My company was hired by a woman
named Penelope Widmore.

235
00:16:01,261 --> 00:16:03,164
I don't know why. I never met her.

236
00:16:03,325 --> 00:16:04,959
She gave us a set of coordinates.

237
00:16:05,636 --> 00:16:08,889
We've been conducting a differential
G.P.S. grid search ever since.

238
00:16:09,886 --> 00:16:11,445
You knew about the island?

239
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:12,755
Island?

240
00:16:13,063 --> 00:16:15,610
We were given coordinates
in the middle of the bloody ocean.

241
00:16:15,948 --> 00:16:17,602
We thought it was a fool's errand...

242
00:16:17,891 --> 00:16:19,162
till three days ago.

243
00:16:19,991 --> 00:16:22,134
I was flying back for the ship,
when all of a sudden

244
00:16:22,135 --> 00:16:24,079
the clouds cleared, and I saw land.

245
00:16:24,871 --> 00:16:26,428
The instruments started spinning.

246
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:30,011
I realized I was going down,
so I grabbed my chute, and I bailed.

247
00:16:34,738 --> 00:16:36,661
Did you actually see her helicopter?

248
00:16:38,448 --> 00:16:39,448
No.

249
00:16:39,896 --> 00:16:41,237
You think I'm lying, mate?

250
00:16:41,386 --> 00:16:43,135
I take it you have no means whatsoever

251
00:16:43,198 --> 00:16:45,309
of communicating
with that freighter of yours?

252
00:16:47,387 --> 00:16:49,540
What was your name? Sayid?

253
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:51,010
Yes.

254
00:17:01,386 --> 00:17:03,330
Remind me not to rescue you, Sayid.

255
00:17:31,154 --> 00:17:32,425
So Ben...

256
00:17:32,753 --> 00:17:35,199
You said I'd kill him
when I heard what he's got to say.

257
00:17:35,822 --> 00:17:38,160
- That's right.
- Well, you wanna give me a heads-up?

258
00:17:39,135 --> 00:17:40,923
It's not really my place to tell you.

259
00:17:44,884 --> 00:17:47,587
Look, what you read in that file...

260
00:17:49,073 --> 00:17:50,517
about the guy in Sydney...

261
00:17:52,008 --> 00:17:53,559
I thought he was someone else.

262
00:17:53,762 --> 00:17:55,918
I made a mistake.
I didn't mean to kill him.

263
00:17:57,949 --> 00:17:59,560
Well, who'd you mean to kill?

264
00:18:08,446 --> 00:18:09,557
Are we almost there?

265
00:18:12,129 --> 00:18:13,189
Almost.

266
00:18:27,697 --> 00:18:28,697
Wake up, John.

267
00:18:31,324 --> 00:18:32,324
It's time.

268
00:19:03,717 --> 00:19:06,836
I know it won't be easy,
but the quicker the better.

269
00:19:11,509 --> 00:19:12,897
You're kidding me, right?

270
00:19:14,448 --> 00:19:16,601
You expect him to kill me?

271
00:19:22,198 --> 00:19:24,584
The hesitation that you're feeling
is just the part of you

272
00:19:24,631 --> 00:19:27,520
that still feels like
he has a perfectly good explanation

273
00:19:27,567 --> 00:19:28,864
for stealing your kidney,

274
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:31,582
throwing you out of an 8-story window.

275
00:19:32,574 --> 00:19:34,407
Don't you wanna be free from him?

276
00:19:34,947 --> 00:19:38,785
The hesitation he's feeling
is because he is a spineless...

277
00:19:38,853 --> 00:19:39,949
Shut up!

278
00:19:48,281 --> 00:19:50,232
- I gotta think...
- Don't think, John.

279
00:19:50,323 --> 00:19:52,060
You're wasting your time, bug-eye.

280
00:19:52,509 --> 00:19:54,059
Me and him have been through all this.

281
00:19:54,194 --> 00:19:57,281
- All he wants is his daddy...
- Shut up! I said shut up!

282
00:20:01,661 --> 00:20:04,532
You really haven't figured it out yet,
have you?

283
00:20:06,933 --> 00:20:09,166
Let go of him, John.

284
00:20:12,133 --> 00:20:13,320
Why are you doing this to me?

285
00:20:13,446 --> 00:20:16,946
You're doing this to yourself.
As long as he's still breathing,

286
00:20:17,072 --> 00:20:20,360
you'll still be
that same sad, pathetic little man

287
00:20:20,445 --> 00:20:22,687
that was kicked off his walkabout tour

288
00:20:23,128 --> 00:20:25,399
because you couldn't walk.

289
00:20:49,636 --> 00:20:53,228
I'll be here the rest of the week, John,
if you change your mind...

290
00:21:09,524 --> 00:21:10,573
I'm sorry.

291
00:21:13,511 --> 00:21:15,233
He's not who we thought he was.

292
00:22:07,823 --> 00:22:08,823
Son of a...

293
00:22:19,731 --> 00:22:21,544
Nice place you got here, Locke.

294
00:22:24,079 --> 00:22:25,585
Ben's inside in the brig.

295
00:22:26,823 --> 00:22:27,823
You ready?

296
00:22:30,322 --> 00:22:31,322
Yeah, I'm ready.

297
00:22:52,727 --> 00:22:53,853
Friends of yours?

298
00:22:54,607 --> 00:22:57,872
It's an old slaving ship,
mid nineteenth century,

299
00:23:04,994 --> 00:23:06,361
My guess is they...

300
00:23:06,614 --> 00:23:09,990
captured the slaves and brought them
here to try and mine the island.

301
00:23:14,109 --> 00:23:15,308
What's in the boxes?

302
00:23:15,698 --> 00:23:16,753
That'd be dynamite.

303
00:23:22,822 --> 00:23:24,077
Son of a bitch.

304
00:23:25,133 --> 00:23:27,074
You really kidnapped the little bastard.

305
00:23:31,721 --> 00:23:33,203
We ain't killin' him, Locke.

306
00:23:35,136 --> 00:23:36,469
Whatever you say, James.

307
00:23:56,132 --> 00:23:57,322
Well, well, well.

308
00:24:01,822 --> 00:24:03,689
What are you doing?!
Open the damn door!

309
00:24:03,973 --> 00:24:05,134
Shut up!

310
00:24:05,356 --> 00:24:06,508
Open up!

311
00:24:07,870 --> 00:24:10,235
I said shut up!

312
00:24:16,214 --> 00:24:17,487
Who the hell are you?

313
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:23,560
- It's like a radio?
- It's like a radio, yes,

314
00:24:24,165 --> 00:24:26,402
but I've never seen
equipment this sophisticated.

315
00:24:26,792 --> 00:24:28,334
But you can still make it work, right?

316
00:24:28,477 --> 00:24:29,477
I hope so.

317
00:24:31,603 --> 00:24:33,051
And what about the other part?

318
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:36,443
The part about they found the plane
and we're all dead?

319
00:24:37,166 --> 00:24:38,277
One thing at a time.

320
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:47,638
There's not a single audible channel.

321
00:24:47,953 --> 00:24:49,613
Whatever that interference is,

322
00:24:49,814 --> 00:24:52,507
it's blocking our ability
to send our own transmission.

323
00:24:52,975 --> 00:24:53,975
If we...

324
00:24:54,288 --> 00:24:56,177
What's that? Is that a radio?

325
00:24:57,852 --> 00:24:58,907
Where'd you get it?

326
00:24:59,371 --> 00:25:00,441
Uh, the luggage.

327
00:25:00,792 --> 00:25:03,016
What, you just found a radio
in the luggage?

328
00:25:03,101 --> 00:25:07,457
Kate, if I explain,
I want you to keep this very quiet.

329
00:25:08,913 --> 00:25:10,079
Keep what very quiet?

330
00:25:13,055 --> 00:25:15,700
Locke! Open the damn door!

331
00:25:16,288 --> 00:25:19,597
Open it up! I can hear you,
you bald bastard!

332
00:25:25,539 --> 00:25:26,539
Rousseau?

333
00:25:27,850 --> 00:25:28,850
Locke.

334
00:25:31,166 --> 00:25:32,793
What brings you to "The Black Rock"?

335
00:25:33,099 --> 00:25:35,124
Dynamite. And you?

336
00:25:35,705 --> 00:25:36,913
Open this door!

337
00:25:39,102 --> 00:25:40,102
Open up!

338
00:25:44,603 --> 00:25:46,158
Crates are right over there.

339
00:25:49,841 --> 00:25:51,087
Open this damn door!

340
00:25:51,225 --> 00:25:52,796
Be careful. It's unstable.

341
00:26:14,936 --> 00:26:16,167
It's beautiful, isn't it?

342
00:26:17,227 --> 00:26:19,187
No matter how much time
you spend on the island,

343
00:26:19,230 --> 00:26:20,779
you just never get tired of this view.

344
00:26:20,976 --> 00:26:23,153
We haven't been formally introduced.

345
00:26:23,226 --> 00:26:24,226
I'm Richard.

346
00:26:26,349 --> 00:26:28,511
- You mind if I join you?
- Oh, sure.

347
00:26:35,539 --> 00:26:37,039
He wanted to embarrass you.

348
00:26:38,162 --> 00:26:39,162
I'm sorry?

349
00:26:39,476 --> 00:26:41,667
Ben knew you weren't gonna kill
your own father.

350
00:26:43,192 --> 00:26:44,373
He put you in front of

351
00:26:44,909 --> 00:26:48,089
everyone in our camp
just so they could all watch you fail.

352
00:26:49,601 --> 00:26:50,601
Why?

353
00:26:54,416 --> 00:26:55,860
'cause when word got back here

354
00:26:55,925 --> 00:26:58,475
that there was a man
with a broken spine on the plane

355
00:26:58,551 --> 00:27:00,774
who could suddenly walk again, well...

356
00:27:01,038 --> 00:27:04,038
People here began to get very excited,
because that...

357
00:27:05,602 --> 00:27:08,532
That could only happen to someone
who was extremely special.

358
00:27:11,291 --> 00:27:14,183
Now Ben doesn't want anyone
to think you're special, John.

359
00:27:14,727 --> 00:27:16,108
And why are you telling me this?

360
00:27:17,831 --> 00:27:19,589
Ben has been wasting our time

361
00:27:19,638 --> 00:27:22,725
with novelties like fertility problems.

362
00:27:23,726 --> 00:27:25,987
We're looking for someone to remind us

363
00:27:26,073 --> 00:27:28,426
that we're here
for more important reasons.

364
00:27:30,476 --> 00:27:31,627
What do you want from me?

365
00:27:31,663 --> 00:27:35,279
I want for you to find your purpose,
and to do that,

366
00:27:36,227 --> 00:27:37,975
your father has to go, John,

367
00:27:39,359 --> 00:27:41,245
and since you're not going to do it...

368
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:49,391
I'm gonna suggest someone else.

369
00:27:54,916 --> 00:27:55,916
Sawyer?

370
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:59,650
Why would Sawyer kill my father?
He doesn't even know him.

371
00:27:59,849 --> 00:28:00,849
Keep reading.

372
00:28:05,978 --> 00:28:07,244
Open this damn door!

373
00:28:08,097 --> 00:28:09,362
Son of a bitch!

374
00:28:19,174 --> 00:28:21,022
I'm pointin' my gun at you, John-boy.

375
00:28:21,475 --> 00:28:23,548
You got three seconds to open this door!

376
00:28:24,619 --> 00:28:26,608
You're not gonna shoot anyone, James.

377
00:28:27,724 --> 00:28:28,724
One...

378
00:28:30,724 --> 00:28:31,724
two!

379
00:28:32,036 --> 00:28:33,592
If there were any bullets in that gun,

380
00:28:33,664 --> 00:28:35,672
why would you hold a knife to my throat?

381
00:28:40,315 --> 00:28:41,627
Son of a bitch!

382
00:28:42,563 --> 00:28:44,403
Guess I didn't raise no dummies.

383
00:28:45,170 --> 00:28:46,390
What the hell's that mean?

384
00:28:46,503 --> 00:28:50,137
It means that "bald-headed bastard"
outside the door is my son.

385
00:28:52,563 --> 00:28:53,577
Come again?

386
00:28:53,697 --> 00:28:54,741
My son.

387
00:28:55,534 --> 00:28:57,344
As in I'm his father.

388
00:28:57,647 --> 00:28:58,920
You do speak English?

389
00:29:05,277 --> 00:29:07,388
How did you get here... to the island?

390
00:29:08,088 --> 00:29:09,088
Island?

391
00:29:11,526 --> 00:29:14,526
I'm driving down I-10
through Tallahassee, when bam...

392
00:29:15,151 --> 00:29:17,168
Somebody slams into the back of my car.

393
00:29:19,588 --> 00:29:22,371
I go right into the divider
at 70 miles an hour.

394
00:29:22,465 --> 00:29:23,687
The next thing I know,

395
00:29:23,994 --> 00:29:25,880
the paramedics are strapping me
to a gurney,

396
00:29:25,901 --> 00:29:27,526
stuffing me in the back of an ambulance,

397
00:29:27,527 --> 00:29:29,863
and one of them actually smiles at me

398
00:29:29,965 --> 00:29:33,553
as he pops the I.V. In my arm,
and then... nothing.

399
00:29:34,467 --> 00:29:36,036
Just black.

400
00:29:38,086 --> 00:29:40,650
And the next thing I know,
I wake up in a dark room

401
00:29:40,713 --> 00:29:43,546
tied up, gag in my mouth,
and when the door opens,

402
00:29:43,776 --> 00:29:47,007
I'm looking up at the same man
I threw out a window...

403
00:29:47,338 --> 00:29:48,984
John Locke,

404
00:29:50,270 --> 00:29:51,874
my dead son.

405
00:30:02,179 --> 00:30:04,187
And he's dead 'cause you threw him
out a window?

406
00:30:04,275 --> 00:30:06,163
No, he survived that,

407
00:30:06,886 --> 00:30:09,402
but it paralyzed him, permanently.

408
00:30:10,836 --> 00:30:14,286
He's dead because the plane
he was flying on crashed in the Pacific.

409
00:30:18,354 --> 00:30:20,155
Well, I got bad news for you, pops,

410
00:30:20,310 --> 00:30:22,505
'cause I was on that plane
with your son,

411
00:30:23,964 --> 00:30:25,653
and he sure as hell wasn't crippled.

412
00:30:26,187 --> 00:30:29,103
And we didn't crash in the pacific.
We crashed here on this island.

413
00:30:29,346 --> 00:30:30,861
You sure it's an island?

414
00:30:31,789 --> 00:30:33,011
Well, what else is it?

415
00:30:33,225 --> 00:30:35,313
Little hot for heaven, isn't it?

416
00:30:37,914 --> 00:30:40,583
Oh, okay, so we're dead.

417
00:30:40,914 --> 00:30:43,499
They found your plane
on the bottom of the ocean.

418
00:30:45,132 --> 00:30:47,231
One minute I'm in a car wreck,
and the next minute

419
00:30:47,289 --> 00:30:49,433
I'm in a pirate ship
in the middle of the jungle?

420
00:30:49,474 --> 00:30:51,139
If ts isn't hell, friend...

421
00:30:52,908 --> 00:30:53,996
Then where are we?

422
00:31:00,540 --> 00:31:02,312
Why did you throw Locke out a window?

423
00:31:02,502 --> 00:31:04,200
He was becoming a nuisance.

424
00:31:07,041 --> 00:31:09,448
I conned him into giving me
one of his kidneys.

425
00:31:09,789 --> 00:31:10,955
He never got over it.

426
00:31:13,601 --> 00:31:14,601
Conned?

427
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:16,290
Yes, sir.

428
00:31:17,038 --> 00:31:18,038
Conned.

429
00:31:25,162 --> 00:31:26,216
What's your name?

430
00:31:27,469 --> 00:31:28,469
Your name?

431
00:31:29,218 --> 00:31:31,535
A con man goes by many names, friend.

432
00:31:32,594 --> 00:31:33,913
I've been Alan Seward,

433
00:31:34,376 --> 00:31:38,082
Anthony Cooper, Ten McLaren, Tom Sawyer,

434
00:31:38,467 --> 00:31:40,850
- Louis Jackson, Paul...
- Tom Sawyer?

435
00:31:42,656 --> 00:31:44,831
I was young, and "Huck Finn"
was taken...

436
00:31:45,689 --> 00:31:47,744
And the ladies loved that one.

437
00:31:48,403 --> 00:31:49,531
Made me charming.

438
00:31:54,530 --> 00:31:55,696
Well, how about that?

439
00:31:58,395 --> 00:31:59,528
How about what?

440
00:32:02,814 --> 00:32:04,573
Sawyer's my name, too.

441
00:32:26,796 --> 00:32:28,800
Ben, what's going on?

442
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:32,359
- We're moving.
- Moving? Where are we going?

443
00:32:32,487 --> 00:32:34,209
We are not going anywhere, John.

444
00:32:34,802 --> 00:32:36,372
You are going to stay behind.

445
00:32:36,739 --> 00:32:38,572
You both are going to stay behind.

446
00:32:39,771 --> 00:32:41,601
What? You're not taking him?

447
00:32:41,867 --> 00:32:44,569
He's your mess, John.
Why would we clean him up?

448
00:32:44,587 --> 00:32:47,180
Ben, if you're trying to put me
in my place, or embarrass me...

449
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:49,710
Where would you get
a ridiculous idea like that?

450
00:32:50,987 --> 00:32:52,375
Well, you can't leave me.

451
00:32:52,488 --> 00:32:55,800
- After everything, you can't just...
- Don't tell me what I can't do, John.

452
00:32:59,113 --> 00:33:01,180
But I thought I was... special.

453
00:33:04,363 --> 00:33:06,029
Well, everyone makes mistakes.

454
00:33:10,175 --> 00:33:11,175
We're leaving now.

455
00:33:12,301 --> 00:33:15,189
We'll leave a trail...
one you can track. And, John,

456
00:33:16,614 --> 00:33:19,435
unless you're carrying
your father's body on your back,

457
00:33:20,646 --> 00:33:21,715
don't bother.

458
00:33:55,026 --> 00:33:56,509
What's the matter with you?

459
00:33:58,363 --> 00:34:00,456
You ever been to Jasper, Alabama?

460
00:34:02,737 --> 00:34:03,737
Why?

461
00:34:04,488 --> 00:34:05,876
Have you, or haven't you?

462
00:34:07,862 --> 00:34:09,306
Yeah, I've been to Jasper.

463
00:34:10,572 --> 00:34:12,349
Don't tell me I'm your daddy.

464
00:34:13,984 --> 00:34:14,984
No.

465
00:34:17,107 --> 00:34:18,427
You killed my daddy.

466
00:34:39,983 --> 00:34:40,983
Read it.

467
00:34:48,422 --> 00:34:50,089
"Dear Mr. Sawyer... "

468
00:34:53,295 --> 00:34:55,124
- What is this?
- Just read it.

469
00:34:58,481 --> 00:35:02,538
"You don't know who I am,
but I know who you are,

470
00:35:03,922 --> 00:35:05,366
"and I know what you done.

471
00:35:06,669 --> 00:35:08,240
"You had sex with my mother

472
00:35:09,046 --> 00:35:12,262
"and then you stole
my dad's money all away,

473
00:35:12,795 --> 00:35:16,048
"so he got angry,
and he killed my mother... "

474
00:35:17,671 --> 00:35:19,597
"and then he killed himself... "

475
00:35:25,365 --> 00:35:26,491
So what?

476
00:35:27,319 --> 00:35:30,040
Is this supposed to be you?
You wrote this letter?

477
00:35:31,788 --> 00:35:32,977
Hey, wait a second.

478
00:35:33,899 --> 00:35:35,165
Did you take my name

479
00:35:35,232 --> 00:35:37,724
because you were on some kind
of revenge kick?

480
00:35:39,855 --> 00:35:41,850
- Keep reading.
- Easy, easy.

481
00:35:42,709 --> 00:35:44,229
Don't get all worked up.

482
00:35:45,104 --> 00:35:48,622
Look, I ran that con two dozen times.

483
00:35:49,603 --> 00:35:51,875
- If your mother was one of the...
- Mary.

484
00:35:54,292 --> 00:35:55,529
Her name was Mary.

485
00:35:59,291 --> 00:36:01,397
Mary from Jasper, Alabama.

486
00:36:02,978 --> 00:36:05,517
Yeah, I remember her.

487
00:36:06,731 --> 00:36:10,397
She practically begged me
to take her $38,000

488
00:36:10,604 --> 00:36:13,426
and to rescue her
from her sorry little life.

489
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:16,702
You finish the letter.

490
00:36:17,165 --> 00:36:19,054
Look, I only took her money.

491
00:36:19,416 --> 00:36:21,770
It ain't my fault your dad overreacted.

492
00:36:22,105 --> 00:36:24,170
If he pulled the old murder-suicide,

493
00:36:24,291 --> 00:36:26,159
then I'm sure he's down here
somewhere.

494
00:36:26,292 --> 00:36:28,101
Maybe you could take this up with him.

495
00:36:28,166 --> 00:36:29,282
Finish it!

496
00:36:47,881 --> 00:36:49,242
You wanna go to hell?

497
00:36:50,175 --> 00:36:51,517
You wanna go to hell?!

498
00:37:41,353 --> 00:37:42,353
Thank you.

499
00:37:48,512 --> 00:37:50,172
You missing those cheeseburgers yet?

500
00:37:50,340 --> 00:37:51,408
Only every second.

501
00:37:57,194 --> 00:37:58,354
I need to talk to you.

502
00:38:01,318 --> 00:38:03,387
- In private.
- No problem.

503
00:38:03,441 --> 00:38:05,851
Anything you wanna say to me,
you can say in front of her.

504
00:38:05,907 --> 00:38:06,945
Not this.

505
00:38:07,256 --> 00:38:09,790
- It's okay.
- No, no. You can stay.

506
00:38:12,231 --> 00:38:13,875
Yeah, you know what? You should stay.

507
00:38:14,704 --> 00:38:16,753
Seems only fair, considering
that she's the reason

508
00:38:16,754 --> 00:38:18,639
no one wants to tell you
that there's a woman

509
00:38:18,690 --> 00:38:21,558
in Hurley's tent who parachuted
onto the island yesterday.

510
00:38:22,004 --> 00:38:23,221
- What?
- A woman.

511
00:38:23,268 --> 00:38:25,242
She jumped from her chopper
before it crashed.

512
00:38:25,253 --> 00:38:27,105
She says that the boat
that she took off from

513
00:38:27,129 --> 00:38:29,646
is about 80 miles off the coast
and that if she can find a way

514
00:38:29,686 --> 00:38:31,263
to contact it, we'll all be rescued!

515
00:38:31,422 --> 00:38:32,732
Why didn't anyone tell me this?

516
00:38:34,978 --> 00:38:37,901
I already told you...
because they don't trust you.

517
00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:47,380
How?

518
00:38:48,373 --> 00:38:49,378
How what?

519
00:38:49,379 --> 00:38:51,066
How is she supposed to contact her boat?

520
00:38:51,067 --> 00:38:52,477
Did you hear what I just said?

521
00:38:52,604 --> 00:38:55,530
Hurley, Charlie, Sayid, your friends,
are afraid to...

522
00:38:56,947 --> 00:38:58,007
How?

523
00:39:02,693 --> 00:39:05,604
She had a phone-radio thing.

524
00:39:06,007 --> 00:39:07,569
Sayid's trying to get it to work.

525
00:39:10,962 --> 00:39:12,078
We should tell her.

526
00:39:15,255 --> 00:39:17,164
- No.
- Tell me what?

527
00:39:17,361 --> 00:39:19,669
- We should tell her.
- Not yet.

528
00:39:45,193 --> 00:39:46,438
You can go back now.

529
00:39:48,898 --> 00:39:50,320
Why did you do this?

530
00:39:52,444 --> 00:39:53,838
He ruined my life,

531
00:39:54,485 --> 00:39:55,907
and he ruined yours.

532
00:40:00,004 --> 00:40:01,170
And he had it coming.

533
00:40:06,248 --> 00:40:07,515
Juliet is a mole.

534
00:40:08,323 --> 00:40:10,279
- What?
- She's working for Ben.

535
00:40:10,730 --> 00:40:13,498
He sent her back to find out
which of our women were pregnant.

536
00:40:13,553 --> 00:40:15,899
Three days from now,
there's gonna be a raid on the beach,

537
00:40:15,946 --> 00:40:17,147
and they're gonna take them.

538
00:40:17,257 --> 00:40:19,488
They say they don't want anyone
to get hurt.

539
00:40:21,180 --> 00:40:22,775
Well, why are you telling me?

540
00:40:23,254 --> 00:40:25,841
- So you can warn the camp.
- You warn the camp.

541
00:40:27,756 --> 00:40:28,811
I'm not going back.

542
00:40:30,068 --> 00:40:31,497
You're going back undercover?

543
00:40:33,004 --> 00:40:34,892
No, I was never undercover, James.

544
00:40:36,334 --> 00:40:37,699
I'm on my own journey now.

545
00:40:40,668 --> 00:40:43,154
Even if Juliet is a mole,
they ain't gonna believe me.

546
00:40:43,230 --> 00:40:45,228
I been saying that since she showed up.

547
00:40:47,943 --> 00:40:49,195
They'll believe you now.

548
00:40:57,693 --> 00:40:58,693
Is it true?

549
00:41:00,629 --> 00:41:01,629
Is what true?

550
00:41:02,192 --> 00:41:04,025
That he threw you out a window...

551
00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:08,713
That you were a cripple?

552
00:41:12,629 --> 00:41:13,629
Not anymore.
