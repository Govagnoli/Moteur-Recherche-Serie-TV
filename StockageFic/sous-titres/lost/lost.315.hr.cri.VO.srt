00:00:00,945 --> 00:00:02,284
<i>Previously on</i> Lost...

2
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:05,090
There's a rental car parked out front.
Got to Sue city.

3
00:00:05,178 --> 00:00:07,844
I want you to check in
at the Sage Flower motel.

4
00:00:07,994 --> 00:00:10,354
Wait for me. I'll be there in the a.m.

5
00:00:10,476 --> 00:00:11,481
I love you.

6
00:00:11,588 --> 00:00:12,824
I love you, too.

7
00:00:22,406 --> 00:00:23,757
I don't care what Jack said.

8
00:00:23,808 --> 00:00:26,297
They've got him, and we have
to get him back. I owe him that.

9
00:00:26,336 --> 00:00:28,051
Obviously,
the circumstances have changed.

10
00:00:28,052 --> 00:00:29,463
He may not want to be rescued.

11
00:00:29,481 --> 00:00:32,239
If he's shaking hands with the others,
I'm sure he has a good reason.

12
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:34,679
We came here to rescue Jack,
and that's what we're gonna do.

13
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:36,677
What are you doing here?

14
00:00:36,678 --> 00:00:37,678
I came to get you.

15
00:00:37,991 --> 00:00:38,991
Get outta here.

16
00:00:39,608 --> 00:00:40,708
Don't hurt her!

17
00:00:42,564 --> 00:00:43,838
I made a deal with them.

18
00:00:44,235 --> 00:00:45,568
They're gonna let me go.

19
00:00:46,233 --> 00:00:47,233
Where?

20
00:00:47,495 --> 00:00:48,517
Home.

21
00:00:50,170 --> 00:00:51,612
Jack, we need to go.

22
00:00:53,544 --> 00:00:54,932
Hey, hold it right there!

23
00:00:54,983 --> 00:00:56,937
Get your hands up! Get down!

24
00:00:57,294 --> 00:00:58,373
I said get down!

25
00:00:59,296 --> 00:01:00,608
What are you doing here, John?

26
00:01:00,609 --> 00:01:01,609
I'm sorry, Jack.

27
00:01:01,731 --> 00:01:02,731
Sorry for what?

28
00:01:53,313 --> 00:01:55,435
I was just bringing you
something to eat.

29
00:01:58,842 --> 00:01:59,953
Enjoy your sandwich.

30
00:02:18,792 --> 00:02:20,451
Been on the road a while, huh?

31
00:02:20,654 --> 00:02:22,098
How long is it gonna take?

32
00:02:22,525 --> 00:02:23,933
Well, your fan belt's shot.

33
00:02:23,995 --> 00:02:25,654
I'll take two days, maybe three.

34
00:02:27,594 --> 00:02:29,038
Three days for a fan belt?

35
00:02:30,156 --> 00:02:31,156
Welcome to Iowa.

36
00:02:35,767 --> 00:02:36,767
My name is Johnny.

37
00:02:37,642 --> 00:02:38,642
I'm Lucy.

38
00:02:49,413 --> 00:02:50,995
All 18-karat gold.

39
00:02:51,534 --> 00:02:53,349
Cheapest one in retail for 500 bucks.

40
00:02:53,661 --> 00:02:55,783
Come on. Those don't look real.
I'm not buying.

41
00:02:55,821 --> 00:02:57,442
What do you mean, they don't look real?

42
00:02:57,461 --> 00:02:58,830
My uncle's going out of business.

43
00:02:59,178 --> 00:03:01,879
If you need a lift into town,
I'm finished up here in an hour.

44
00:03:02,293 --> 00:03:04,739
- I call the cops.
- Fine. Whatever. Your loss.

45
00:03:04,758 --> 00:03:05,950
Is there a problem, buddy?

46
00:03:05,951 --> 00:03:07,617
Yeah. Yeah, there's a problem.

47
00:03:07,761 --> 00:03:09,705
I'm getting scammed here,
that's the problem.

48
00:03:09,761 --> 00:03:11,947
- Look, I'm sorry.
- What do you think, I'm an idiot?

49
00:03:11,948 --> 00:03:13,882
If you don't want to buy them,
don't buy them.

50
00:03:13,939 --> 00:03:16,814
Those are fake necklaces,
and you're a rip-off artist.

51
00:03:16,949 --> 00:03:17,949
They're real.

52
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:19,382
I call the cops.

53
00:03:19,613 --> 00:03:21,452
You don't want them,
I'll find somebody else.

54
00:03:21,453 --> 00:03:22,566
Hey, let me see those.

55
00:03:25,136 --> 00:03:26,431
My father owns a jewelry store.

56
00:03:26,451 --> 00:03:27,975
I think I can spot a fake.

57
00:03:28,517 --> 00:03:29,552
How much?

58
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:31,260
60 bucks.

59
00:03:31,324 --> 00:03:32,746
I'll take the one on the end.

60
00:03:35,516 --> 00:03:36,575
Whatever.

61
00:03:39,155 --> 00:03:40,194
Thanks.

62
00:03:44,805 --> 00:03:46,136
Can I get my money back?

63
00:03:55,573 --> 00:03:56,573
Why'd you help me?

64
00:03:57,835 --> 00:04:00,111
Just one girl watching
another girl's back, I guess.

65
00:04:00,343 --> 00:04:01,558
Or you're stranded here,

66
00:04:01,859 --> 00:04:04,933
and for some reason, you didn't want
that guy calling the cops.

67
00:04:14,135 --> 00:04:16,399
I'll give you a ride into town.
You buy me a drink.

68
00:04:28,198 --> 00:04:29,278
What?

69
00:04:36,136 --> 00:04:37,191
What are you doing?

70
00:04:38,824 --> 00:04:39,885
Did they capture you?

71
00:04:39,924 --> 00:04:41,010
Yes, but...

72
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:43,581
Only temporarily.

73
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:47,647
I came to say good-bye.

74
00:04:50,117 --> 00:04:51,117
Good-bye?

75
00:04:51,241 --> 00:04:52,463
I'm leaving with them.

76
00:04:53,446 --> 00:04:54,493
What the hell is going on?

77
00:04:54,494 --> 00:04:56,995
I mean, what are they doing to you?
Are you brainwashed?

78
00:04:57,001 --> 00:04:58,054
Where did Jack go?

79
00:04:58,073 --> 00:04:59,723
Jack didn't go anywhere, Kate.

80
00:05:00,244 --> 00:05:02,366
He's gonna have
to stay behind, like you.

81
00:05:03,555 --> 00:05:04,721
You can't trust them.

82
00:05:05,242 --> 00:05:07,304
If they told you that
they're gonna take you home,

83
00:05:07,305 --> 00:05:09,499
- they're lying...
- I don't want to go home.

84
00:05:11,495 --> 00:05:14,247
I want you to know,
I made a strong case for you.

85
00:05:14,492 --> 00:05:16,410
I told them
that you were a good person...

86
00:05:16,556 --> 00:05:19,074
reliable, smart, honest.

87
00:05:19,582 --> 00:05:22,033
And then they told me
who you were and what you had done.

88
00:05:24,403 --> 00:05:26,911
Let's just say, forgiveness
isn't one of their strong suits.

89
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,120
Good luck.

90
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:35,764
John, where are you going?

91
00:05:35,783 --> 00:05:36,790
Coming out!

92
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,576
Where is Jack and where is Sayid?

93
00:05:40,577 --> 00:05:42,370
Have you seen Rousseau?

94
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:50,183
John, please. What's happened to you?

95
00:05:50,576 --> 00:05:51,576
I'm sorry, Kate.

96
00:06:02,335 --> 00:06:11,504
Subtitle: swsub.com

97
00:06:24,381 --> 00:06:25,652
What the hell's wrong with you?

98
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:28,179
Don't look at me,
and pretend we're not talking.

99
00:06:29,005 --> 00:06:30,378
I'm not supposed to be here.

100
00:06:30,379 --> 00:06:31,379
Good. Then scram.

101
00:06:31,631 --> 00:06:34,077
Dude, you need to know
that there's been some chatter.

102
00:06:34,975 --> 00:06:36,827
After Paulo and Nikki and everything,

103
00:06:37,382 --> 00:06:40,066
Well, tomorrow there's gonna be a vote.

104
00:06:40,702 --> 00:06:41,743
A vote for what?

105
00:06:41,782 --> 00:06:43,991
To decide whether or not to banish you.

106
00:06:44,817 --> 00:06:45,817
Banish me?

107
00:06:47,004 --> 00:06:49,260
- Where?
- Well, there was debate about that,

108
00:06:49,318 --> 00:06:52,222
but the consensus was
half a mile down the beach.

109
00:06:52,889 --> 00:06:53,930
Consensus?

110
00:06:54,630 --> 00:06:57,573
I'm only saying this
because there may be a way to fix it--

111
00:06:57,817 --> 00:06:59,624
to, like, make amends.

112
00:07:02,129 --> 00:07:03,129
I don't do amends.

113
00:07:04,069 --> 00:07:05,368
You might want to ask yourself

114
00:07:05,681 --> 00:07:09,187
about all the good stuff that comes
from being
part of this... society.

115
00:07:10,944 --> 00:07:12,781
I mean, you can't even feed yourself.

116
00:07:12,925 --> 00:07:14,118
You use our latrine,

117
00:07:14,889 --> 00:07:17,860
drink the water that Steve brings
every morning to the trough...

118
00:07:17,944 --> 00:07:18,944
What?

119
00:07:19,007 --> 00:07:23,965
You know how for 3 days, 10 h and 15 min
I ain't allowed to use nicknames?

120
00:07:24,753 --> 00:07:30,309
Well, you, sir... Hugo,
are rotund,

121
00:07:31,192 --> 00:07:32,192
annoying,

122
00:07:32,504 --> 00:07:34,281
and you're ruining my damn view.

123
00:07:34,693 --> 00:07:35,802
How's that for amends?

124
00:07:37,131 --> 00:07:38,645
You're making a big mistake, dude.

125
00:07:41,568 --> 00:07:42,568
Banish me...

126
00:09:12,229 --> 00:09:13,927
How about you tell me your name?

127
00:09:15,289 --> 00:09:17,468
- It's Lucy.
- And what's your real name?

128
00:09:18,509 --> 00:09:20,515
Next time somebody asks,
you don't think about it.

129
00:09:20,539 --> 00:09:22,903
- I didn't think--
- Not even for a second.

130
00:09:24,235 --> 00:09:25,604
So why Lucy?

131
00:09:26,352 --> 00:09:27,352
She's a saint.

132
00:09:27,638 --> 00:09:29,529
I had to memorize them all
in Sunday's school,

133
00:09:29,567 --> 00:09:31,975
so I figure they're probably still
rattling around my brain.

134
00:09:31,976 --> 00:09:34,703
What makes a girl who went
to Sunday school scared of cops?

135
00:09:42,590 --> 00:09:44,924
A few months ago,
I killed my stepfather.

136
00:09:45,087 --> 00:09:47,518
I escaped from the marshal
who arrested me for it.

137
00:09:51,027 --> 00:09:52,027
Why?

138
00:09:54,728 --> 00:09:56,109
'cause he was a bad guy.

139
00:10:00,026 --> 00:10:01,060
So...

140
00:10:01,833 --> 00:10:03,796
what the hell are you doing in Iowa?

141
00:10:05,401 --> 00:10:06,751
I want to talk to my mother.

142
00:10:11,263 --> 00:10:13,558
You're gonna have
a really hard time doing that,

143
00:10:13,701 --> 00:10:15,732
because if you did
what you just said you did,

144
00:10:16,186 --> 00:10:18,597
the feds are gonna be watching her 24/7.

145
00:10:19,066 --> 00:10:20,096
I'll figure something out.

146
00:10:20,324 --> 00:10:22,822
- Oh, you will, huh?
- What, you want to help me?

147
00:10:29,761 --> 00:10:30,761
Absolutely.

148
00:10:33,074 --> 00:10:34,074
Why?

149
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:41,398
I fell in love with the wrong guy,

150
00:10:42,637 --> 00:10:44,544
and then I gave him my life savings.

151
00:10:46,949 --> 00:10:49,323
He conned me and embarrassed me.

152
00:10:49,932 --> 00:10:51,236
He was a bad guy.

153
00:10:53,636 --> 00:10:54,636
So...

154
00:10:54,886 --> 00:10:58,221
I'll help you get the meeting
with your mom... Lucy,

155
00:10:59,175 --> 00:11:01,471
because one of us
deserves something good.

156
00:12:18,449 --> 00:12:20,337
I ain't gonna get the Korean vote...

157
00:12:33,571 --> 00:12:35,365
Come on, come on!

158
00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:00,581
Hey, let's do it!

159
00:13:02,187 --> 00:13:03,187
Do what?

160
00:13:04,125 --> 00:13:06,446
I'm ready to do it: make amends,

161
00:13:06,867 --> 00:13:07,932
change the vote.

162
00:13:09,937 --> 00:13:11,714
I don't wanna be banished, okay?

163
00:13:11,982 --> 00:13:12,998
You happy?

164
00:13:13,937 --> 00:13:14,992
Dude, you stink.

165
00:13:16,187 --> 00:13:17,242
What is that, fish?

166
00:13:19,741 --> 00:13:21,497
Did you try to gut one yourself?

167
00:13:23,124 --> 00:13:24,791
How have you not learned that by now?

168
00:13:25,050 --> 00:13:26,965
I mean, we've been here, like,
three months.

169
00:13:27,313 --> 00:13:28,535
Could we just do this?

170
00:13:28,937 --> 00:13:29,937
Do what?

171
00:13:31,687 --> 00:13:32,694
Make nice?

172
00:13:34,501 --> 00:13:36,819
Apologize for calling me
all those names.

173
00:13:40,439 --> 00:13:42,777
I'm really sorry I called you "rotund."

174
00:13:44,462 --> 00:13:47,086
- Really?
- You're worse than a girl.

175
00:13:47,814 --> 00:13:50,361
Come on. Let's spread the love.

176
00:14:21,684 --> 00:14:22,988
What the hell am I doing here?

177
00:14:22,989 --> 00:14:24,778
- Why don't you tell me?
- I don't know.

178
00:14:24,845 --> 00:14:25,861
I don't know either!

179
00:14:25,862 --> 00:14:27,982
So, why don't you let go of my wrist?

180
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:52,105
So what the hell happened?

181
00:14:53,922 --> 00:14:55,485
I was making a cup of tea.

182
00:14:56,426 --> 00:14:58,459
Canister came in through the window.

183
00:15:00,674 --> 00:15:02,342
So what'd you do to piss them off?

184
00:15:04,668 --> 00:15:06,056
You're wasting your time.

185
00:15:06,668 --> 00:15:07,834
The knife is too big.

186
00:15:08,291 --> 00:15:09,980
We need something smaller.
A safety pin...

187
00:15:09,981 --> 00:15:12,425
- We're going back.
- What?

188
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:14,543
They did this to us.
Why would we go back?

189
00:15:14,623 --> 00:15:16,937
You say "they"
like you didn't lock me in a cage

190
00:15:17,014 --> 00:15:18,626
and watch me break rocks all day.

191
00:15:23,854 --> 00:15:25,814
We're going back to your village because

192
00:15:26,419 --> 00:15:28,738
my friends were probably gassed,
just like us.

193
00:15:29,294 --> 00:15:30,424
Your people are gone anyway.

194
00:15:30,854 --> 00:15:32,882
- I saw them all pack up and leave.
- What?

195
00:15:33,607 --> 00:15:35,440
Locke came to me to say good-bye.

196
00:15:36,473 --> 00:15:38,325
They were taking off,
going somewhere else.

197
00:15:38,364 --> 00:15:39,598
Going? Going where?

198
00:15:39,767 --> 00:15:41,542
He didn't exactly tell me.

199
00:15:45,418 --> 00:15:48,469
Welcome to the wonderful world
of not knowing what the hell's going on.

200
00:16:18,912 --> 00:16:20,029
On the ground!

201
00:16:20,718 --> 00:16:22,589
Get down! On the ground!

202
00:16:23,003 --> 00:16:24,566
Let me see those hands!

203
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:28,057
Let me see those hands!

204
00:16:29,957 --> 00:16:31,520
Long time no see, Austen.

205
00:16:39,102 --> 00:16:41,422
- Who the hell are you?
- I'm just selling bibles!

206
00:17:12,325 --> 00:17:13,404
Hi.

207
00:17:16,285 --> 00:17:18,099
They questioned me for half an hour.

208
00:17:18,841 --> 00:17:20,193
He confiscated my case.

209
00:17:20,833 --> 00:17:23,168
He was asking me about
selling bibles and...

210
00:17:23,828 --> 00:17:25,796
It's a good thing I know how to lie.

211
00:17:25,866 --> 00:17:27,892
Yeah, now we know
what we're up against, right?

212
00:17:27,911 --> 00:17:29,028
Yeah, now we know

213
00:17:29,047 --> 00:17:32,097
that there were six guys
waiting to take you down, Lucy

214
00:17:32,229 --> 00:17:33,985
Yeah, it's okay. I'll figure it out.

215
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:36,918
Figure it out? That marshal...

216
00:17:37,656 --> 00:17:39,169
I don't know what you did to him,

217
00:17:39,218 --> 00:17:42,481
but if he ever gets his hands on you,
it is gonna be you or him.

218
00:17:42,558 --> 00:17:44,390
Look, if you've changed your mind,

219
00:17:44,528 --> 00:17:46,462
if you don't wanna help me, I get it.

220
00:17:46,505 --> 00:17:47,653
No, I do wanna help you,

221
00:17:47,654 --> 00:17:50,239
but if I'm lying to federal agents,
Lucy,

222
00:17:50,279 --> 00:17:52,466
so that you can have
a chat with your mom...

223
00:17:53,459 --> 00:17:56,299
then I at least need to know
that there's a pretty good reason.

224
00:18:00,368 --> 00:18:01,381
He...

225
00:18:01,728 --> 00:18:03,178
He... used to get drunk

226
00:18:03,824 --> 00:18:07,027
and beat up my mom,
so I blew up his house.

227
00:18:08,017 --> 00:18:09,017
I...

228
00:18:09,954 --> 00:18:11,553
Made it look like an accident...

229
00:18:13,077 --> 00:18:14,254
a gas leak.

230
00:18:15,829 --> 00:18:18,273
Took out an insurance policy
on the house...

231
00:18:18,891 --> 00:18:19,891
for her.

232
00:18:21,018 --> 00:18:22,129
Set her up for life.

233
00:18:26,079 --> 00:18:27,632
And then she gave me up.

234
00:18:30,645 --> 00:18:31,704
Chose him over me.

235
00:18:35,134 --> 00:18:37,083
So the reason
I need to talk to her is...

236
00:18:38,356 --> 00:18:39,803
someone I love...

237
00:18:40,391 --> 00:18:44,114
Someone who's supposed
to care about me betrayed me,

238
00:18:45,455 --> 00:18:46,771
and I wanna know why.

239
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:51,129
Well...

240
00:18:52,318 --> 00:18:53,595
then let's go find out.

241
00:18:59,577 --> 00:19:00,684
What are you doing?

242
00:19:01,647 --> 00:19:03,468
Whoever dragged us out here
left a trail.

243
00:19:03,469 --> 00:19:05,219
It'll lead us back to where
we came from.

244
00:19:05,335 --> 00:19:06,435
Let's go.

245
00:19:07,276 --> 00:19:08,492
It's gonna rain.

246
00:19:08,558 --> 00:19:10,449
Don't you think
we should wait till morning?

247
00:19:22,412 --> 00:19:23,412
Why?

248
00:19:23,724 --> 00:19:24,724
Why what?

249
00:19:25,038 --> 00:19:26,602
Why would they handcuff you to me

250
00:19:26,603 --> 00:19:28,823
and then drag us all the way
out into the jungle?

251
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:30,761
Ben has a thing for mind games.

252
00:19:32,562 --> 00:19:34,280
Is that why he left you behind?

253
00:19:34,538 --> 00:19:35,982
Do we really have to talk?

254
00:19:37,165 --> 00:19:38,165
Nope.

255
00:19:45,610 --> 00:19:47,790
Come on.
If the trail gets wet, I'll lose it.

256
00:19:47,868 --> 00:19:51,379
I hope you're not dragging me
all the way back there with you for him.

257
00:19:52,975 --> 00:19:56,016
- Excuse me?
- I hope you're not going back for Jack,

258
00:19:57,227 --> 00:19:59,483
because I was standing right there

259
00:19:59,789 --> 00:20:02,238
when he told you not to come back,

260
00:20:02,495 --> 00:20:05,659
and now that you've ruined his
chance to get off the island...

261
00:20:19,318 --> 00:20:20,474
You done?

262
00:20:22,038 --> 00:20:23,479
I said, are you done?

263
00:20:29,438 --> 00:20:31,656
I... I'm sorry. I didn't mean to...

264
00:20:36,306 --> 00:20:37,762
What the hell was that?

265
00:20:48,024 --> 00:20:50,504
- Get up!
- You dislocated my shoulder!

266
00:20:52,382 --> 00:20:53,382
Come on!

267
00:21:00,707 --> 00:21:01,904
Wait! Come here.

268
00:21:05,058 --> 00:21:07,334
Okay. Get down.

269
00:21:08,396 --> 00:21:09,534
What the hell...

270
00:21:57,939 --> 00:21:59,056
Are we safe?

271
00:22:00,024 --> 00:22:01,104
You tell me.

272
00:22:13,831 --> 00:22:15,544
I ain't kissing no damn baby.

273
00:22:15,618 --> 00:22:17,374
Claire's, like, really influential.

274
00:22:17,428 --> 00:22:19,554
If she votes for you to stay,
you're home free, dude.

275
00:22:19,555 --> 00:22:21,198
Why wouldn't she vote for me?

276
00:22:21,493 --> 00:22:23,492
It's not like I ever done
anything bad to her.

277
00:22:23,493 --> 00:22:26,249
Nah, but you never did
anything good for her either.

278
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:28,811
And have you ever
even asked how Aaron is?

279
00:22:29,556 --> 00:22:31,115
I know how he is.

280
00:22:32,099 --> 00:22:33,503
He cries loud, and he smells.

281
00:22:33,598 --> 00:22:35,368
You see? That's what I'm talking about.

282
00:22:35,407 --> 00:22:37,085
You're sarcastic.
People don't like that.

283
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,129
All right.

284
00:22:38,881 --> 00:22:40,041
So I go over...

285
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:42,239
And do what?

286
00:22:43,307 --> 00:22:45,721
Moms love it when you show
an interest in their babies.

287
00:22:46,704 --> 00:22:50,408
So go over there,
say something nice, call her "Claire".

288
00:22:51,182 --> 00:22:52,182
And give her this.

289
00:22:53,617 --> 00:22:55,117
I know you can do it, dude.

290
00:23:01,178 --> 00:23:02,316
Hey, Claire.

291
00:23:05,994 --> 00:23:08,097
Hey there... little baby...

292
00:23:09,670 --> 00:23:10,679
Aaron.

293
00:23:13,977 --> 00:23:16,385
Is there anything I can do for you?

294
00:23:16,499 --> 00:23:18,226
No. I just came by...

295
00:23:18,782 --> 00:23:20,039
to see your baby.

296
00:23:24,852 --> 00:23:27,390
He's not as wrinkly
as he was a couple weeks ago.

297
00:23:33,608 --> 00:23:36,579
Yeah, I... guess he's not. Thanks.

298
00:23:38,606 --> 00:23:40,477
Oh, and... this is for you.

299
00:23:42,311 --> 00:23:43,940
- Thank you.
- I don't like...

300
00:23:45,985 --> 00:23:47,123
blankets.

301
00:23:49,145 --> 00:23:50,264
Well, good night.

302
00:23:50,714 --> 00:23:51,714
Good night.

303
00:24:02,602 --> 00:24:03,971
Do you think it's gone?

304
00:24:04,464 --> 00:24:07,138
- Are we safe?
- Are you serious?

305
00:24:07,443 --> 00:24:09,083
- What?
- You've never seen that?

306
00:24:09,122 --> 00:24:10,156
If you don't believe me,

307
00:24:10,214 --> 00:24:12,652
you can always pull
my other shoulder out of its socket.

308
00:24:14,034 --> 00:24:16,793
- I was... I wasn't trying to...
- Don't flatter yourself.

309
00:24:16,889 --> 00:24:19,223
This is the fourth time
it's been dislocated.

310
00:24:32,132 --> 00:24:33,367
Give me your hand.

311
00:24:34,528 --> 00:24:36,465
- Why?
- 'cause I want you to pop it back in.

312
00:24:36,466 --> 00:24:38,030
- No, I'm not gonna--
- You're gonna.

313
00:24:38,338 --> 00:24:39,554
Right, now it feels

314
00:24:39,843 --> 00:24:43,914
like there's broken glass under my skin,
and if it weren't for you,

315
00:24:44,896 --> 00:24:46,965
I would be on my way home right now.

316
00:24:46,966 --> 00:24:49,114
Jack told me
not to come back to protect me,

317
00:24:49,526 --> 00:24:51,637
because he didn't want me to get hurt.

318
00:24:53,966 --> 00:24:56,295
- Is that what you think?
- Yeah, that's what I think.

319
00:24:57,781 --> 00:25:00,502
We have cameras on the cages, Kate...

320
00:25:02,276 --> 00:25:03,276
all of them.

321
00:25:04,525 --> 00:25:05,525
He saw you...

322
00:25:06,165 --> 00:25:08,152
you and Sawyer.

323
00:25:09,775 --> 00:25:12,919
The reason Jack told you
not to come back

324
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:16,697
wasn't because
he didn't want you to get hurt.

325
00:25:18,269 --> 00:25:21,163
It was because you broke his heart.

326
00:25:24,402 --> 00:25:25,402
So...

327
00:25:26,583 --> 00:25:27,858
grab my wrist,

328
00:25:28,049 --> 00:25:30,036
push up and twist.

329
00:25:51,543 --> 00:25:53,569
Why do we gotta be out here
so damn early?

330
00:25:53,701 --> 00:25:55,779
You asked me to help you
catch a boar.

331
00:25:56,887 --> 00:25:59,275
Well, this is when they break
cover to eat.

332
00:26:01,012 --> 00:26:03,134
Looks like they picked
a day to sleep in.

333
00:26:03,290 --> 00:26:04,991
So what's your angle, brother?

334
00:26:05,949 --> 00:26:07,609
- My angle?
- Well, you...

335
00:26:08,464 --> 00:26:10,396
Haven't spoken three words to me,
and then...

336
00:26:11,353 --> 00:26:13,205
suddenly you want to be
my hunting partner.

337
00:26:14,637 --> 00:26:15,637
My angle...

338
00:26:16,637 --> 00:26:18,968
is I got hearts and minds to change,

339
00:26:19,512 --> 00:26:21,740
and politics is all about bribes.

340
00:26:23,948 --> 00:26:26,424
Since money don't mean
squat on this island,

341
00:26:27,699 --> 00:26:30,076
I gotta give the people
something they like...

342
00:26:31,447 --> 00:26:33,018
And people like meat.

343
00:26:56,825 --> 00:26:57,936
How's your shoulder?

344
00:27:00,074 --> 00:27:02,115
- Awesome.
- Then let's get going.

345
00:27:13,949 --> 00:27:14,949
Thank you.

346
00:27:15,951 --> 00:27:17,451
You're welcome, sweetheart.

347
00:27:34,742 --> 00:27:37,465
Oh, my god! I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

348
00:27:37,489 --> 00:27:39,248
- No worries.
- I'm such an idiot.

349
00:27:39,394 --> 00:27:41,304
It happens all the time, sweetheart.

350
00:27:42,681 --> 00:27:43,798
Thank you.

351
00:28:04,923 --> 00:28:05,923
Hi, mom.

352
00:28:08,737 --> 00:28:10,423
What are you doing here, Katherine?

353
00:28:14,236 --> 00:28:15,236
You look good.

354
00:28:16,876 --> 00:28:18,535
I asked you what you were doing here.

355
00:28:24,238 --> 00:28:26,964
I want to know why you
told them what I did to Wayne.

356
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:34,322
I thought maybe you came because
you wanted to say you were sorry.

357
00:28:35,838 --> 00:28:37,208
I'm not sorry.

358
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:42,383
He hit you.
He treated you like a dog and you...

359
00:28:42,450 --> 00:28:44,652
You can't help who you love, Katherine.

360
00:28:45,487 --> 00:28:48,352
And for good or bad, I loved him.

361
00:28:49,986 --> 00:28:51,617
And you burnt him alive.

362
00:28:52,487 --> 00:28:54,875
You turned on the gas,
and you lit a match.

363
00:28:55,299 --> 00:28:57,723
You murdered him in cold blood.

364
00:29:00,364 --> 00:29:01,364
I did it for you.

365
00:29:04,021 --> 00:29:06,009
What you did, you did for yourself.

366
00:29:10,577 --> 00:29:12,004
I have to go back to work.

367
00:29:15,165 --> 00:29:16,720
Because you are my daughter,

368
00:29:17,603 --> 00:29:19,729
I'm not gonna tell the two men
sitting at the table

369
00:29:19,730 --> 00:29:22,754
who've been following me
for the last month that you are here,

370
00:29:23,636 --> 00:29:25,314
but I swear to god, Katie...

371
00:29:26,496 --> 00:29:27,827
if I ever see you again,

372
00:29:29,791 --> 00:29:32,046
the first thing I will do
is yell for help.

373
00:29:36,611 --> 00:29:37,728
Good-bye.

374
00:29:53,777 --> 00:29:55,130
Did he say that to you?

375
00:29:55,602 --> 00:29:56,602
Sorry?

376
00:29:57,191 --> 00:29:58,505
That I broke his heart.

377
00:30:00,233 --> 00:30:01,292
He didn't have to.

378
00:30:05,917 --> 00:30:07,422
You don't know anything about him.

379
00:30:07,539 --> 00:30:08,816
I know where he was born.

380
00:30:09,028 --> 00:30:10,728
I know what his parents
did for a living.

381
00:30:10,729 --> 00:30:14,593
I know that he was married
and who he was married to.

382
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:18,235
I know why he got a divorce.
I know how his father died.

383
00:30:19,164 --> 00:30:22,870
I know his height, his weight,
his birthday and his blood type.

384
00:30:25,852 --> 00:30:27,574
What do you know about him, Kate?

385
00:30:34,028 --> 00:30:35,165
Let's go.

386
00:30:43,017 --> 00:30:44,017
Run.

387
00:30:44,077 --> 00:30:45,214
Run!

388
00:31:01,871 --> 00:31:03,549
Get up! Get up!

389
00:31:04,368 --> 00:31:05,680
Run! Run! Come on!

390
00:31:08,432 --> 00:31:09,468
What are you doing?

391
00:31:09,469 --> 00:31:11,558
I know what happens
when you set those things off!

392
00:31:11,577 --> 00:31:12,913
We will go alongside them.

393
00:31:13,009 --> 00:31:15,286
We don't need to!
We can go around there-- off!

394
00:31:16,642 --> 00:31:17,642
Damn it!

395
00:31:28,229 --> 00:31:29,636
You're gonna want to be over here.

396
00:31:32,216 --> 00:31:33,353
Kate, come on!

397
00:32:15,231 --> 00:32:18,979
We don't know what it is, but we know
that it doesn't like our fences.

398
00:32:19,095 --> 00:32:20,368
You had a key!

399
00:32:22,289 --> 00:32:25,125
They left me behind, too.
They gassed me.

400
00:32:25,229 --> 00:32:26,462
I know that you don't care,

401
00:32:26,539 --> 00:32:29,637
but the people I spent
the last three years of my life with

402
00:32:29,727 --> 00:32:31,018
they just left me!

403
00:32:35,428 --> 00:32:36,819
I thought that maybe...

404
00:32:38,289 --> 00:32:41,284
Maybe if I could make you think
that we were in it together...

405
00:32:44,666 --> 00:32:46,617
Maybe I wouldn't get left behind again.

406
00:33:23,562 --> 00:33:24,628
It's delicious!

407
00:33:25,162 --> 00:33:27,273
Just a little Dharma A1 and paprika...

408
00:33:30,059 --> 00:33:31,934
I hope you'll remember
this little barbecue

409
00:33:31,935 --> 00:33:33,785
- at your meeting later.
- Oh, what meeting?

410
00:33:36,497 --> 00:33:38,163
Hurley told me about the vote.

411
00:33:38,248 --> 00:33:40,964
Vote? Since when
did anyone around here vote?

412
00:33:51,445 --> 00:33:52,552
You son of a bitch!

413
00:33:53,122 --> 00:33:54,869
There wasn't ever gonna be no vote.

414
00:33:54,997 --> 00:33:55,997
But...

415
00:33:56,817 --> 00:33:58,074
Wasn't it nice...

416
00:33:58,813 --> 00:33:59,920
Being nice?

417
00:34:00,002 --> 00:34:01,832
You tricked me into being decent?

418
00:34:02,184 --> 00:34:04,513
That's gotta be the lamest con
in the history of cons!

419
00:34:04,571 --> 00:34:05,864
It wasn't a con, dude.

420
00:34:05,999 --> 00:34:09,121
If you're gonna be our temporary leader,
you need to do some damage control.

421
00:34:09,122 --> 00:34:10,181
Leader?

422
00:34:10,633 --> 00:34:11,862
What the hell are you smoking?

423
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:15,543
Jack's gone. Locke's gone.
Kate and Sayid...

424
00:34:17,684 --> 00:34:18,684
You're all we got.

425
00:34:19,350 --> 00:34:20,799
When Paulo and Nikki died,

426
00:34:21,355 --> 00:34:22,639
we all looked to you.

427
00:34:22,954 --> 00:34:25,120
Then again, you totally tried
to steal their diamonds,

428
00:34:25,139 --> 00:34:26,643
but we wanted to look to you.

429
00:34:27,123 --> 00:34:28,130
Look around.

430
00:34:29,486 --> 00:34:30,648
You made everyone happy.

431
00:34:32,928 --> 00:34:34,024
Just for today,

432
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:35,859
they can eat boar,

433
00:34:36,052 --> 00:34:38,607
laugh and forget
that they're totally screwed.

434
00:34:40,365 --> 00:34:42,723
And you did that for them, dude... You.

435
00:34:45,939 --> 00:34:47,648
And what if I don't want
to be the leader?

436
00:34:49,148 --> 00:34:51,181
Yeah, well, I don't think
Jack wanted to, either.

437
00:34:53,991 --> 00:34:55,102
Sucks for you, dude.

438
00:36:28,208 --> 00:36:30,577
Sayid's in one of those backyards
down there.

439
00:36:31,019 --> 00:36:32,062
I'll go get him.

440
00:36:33,305 --> 00:36:34,472
You should get Jack.

441
00:36:53,711 --> 00:36:55,197
Jack, wake up. It's me.

442
00:37:04,583 --> 00:37:05,583
What happened?

443
00:37:07,084 --> 00:37:08,084
They all left.

444
00:37:09,908 --> 00:37:11,181
All left?

445
00:37:18,172 --> 00:37:20,146
- What?
- Because of me.

446
00:37:22,458 --> 00:37:23,458
I'm so sorry.

447
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:26,926
I should've listened to you.

448
00:37:27,059 --> 00:37:28,059
I never...

449
00:37:34,855 --> 00:37:36,855
I wanted to come back to help you...

450
00:37:38,607 --> 00:37:40,051
but you didn't need me to.

451
00:37:45,231 --> 00:37:47,096
And now because of me, you can't go...

452
00:38:01,093 --> 00:38:02,230
I'm so sorry.

453
00:38:11,667 --> 00:38:12,667
They just...

454
00:38:14,563 --> 00:38:15,682
Left?

455
00:38:21,286 --> 00:38:22,867
Even Juliet?

456
00:38:30,019 --> 00:38:31,229
No, they left her, too.

457
00:38:35,337 --> 00:38:36,342
Why?

458
00:38:40,845 --> 00:38:42,681
You know her better than I do.

459
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:50,700
Now what?

460
00:38:56,266 --> 00:38:57,266
Now...

461
00:39:01,138 --> 00:39:02,138
Now we go back.

462
00:39:37,215 --> 00:39:39,701
- Thanks for everything, Cassidy.
- You got it.

463
00:39:43,489 --> 00:39:45,531
So... this guy who ripped you off...

464
00:39:46,925 --> 00:39:49,627
You wanna give me his name,
tell me where I can find him?

465
00:39:51,231 --> 00:39:53,128
You almost got arrested for me, Cassidy.

466
00:39:53,185 --> 00:39:54,266
I wanna help you.

467
00:39:57,066 --> 00:39:58,146
I'm pregnant.

468
00:40:01,989 --> 00:40:04,102
It's his. The baby's his,

469
00:40:05,305 --> 00:40:06,310
and I still love him.

470
00:40:06,926 --> 00:40:09,284
So call the cops. Have him locked up.

471
00:40:09,366 --> 00:40:12,006
Will you ever forgive your mom
for calling the cops?

472
00:40:15,490 --> 00:40:16,490
No, I won't.

473
00:40:26,491 --> 00:40:27,533
Thanks, Lucy.

474
00:40:29,114 --> 00:40:30,114
My name's Kate.

475
00:40:50,362 --> 00:40:51,362
You okay?

476
00:40:52,113 --> 00:40:53,751
Yeah. You?

477
00:41:11,365 --> 00:41:13,946
I've checked all the houses.
Everyone's gone.

478
00:41:15,151 --> 00:41:16,432
No weapons, no trail.

479
00:41:17,836 --> 00:41:20,116
It's like 50 people
disappeared into thin air.

480
00:41:21,650 --> 00:41:23,149
We should take what we can find

481
00:41:23,634 --> 00:41:25,261
and head out while we still got light.

482
00:41:30,213 --> 00:41:31,657
She is not coming with us.

483
00:41:35,398 --> 00:41:36,398
Yes, she is.

484
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:38,400
Why?

485
00:41:43,030 --> 00:41:44,979
Because they left her behind, too.
