1
00:00:00,645 --> 00:00:02,211
Previously on "Lost"...

2
00:00:02,535 --> 00:00:04,053
Tequila and tonic.

3
00:00:04,752 --> 00:00:07,273
- Ana-Lucia.
- Jack.

4
00:00:07,413 --> 00:00:09,789
We'll have the next
drink on the plane, okay?

5
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:13,966
- 42F.
- 42F, right.

6
00:00:18,454 --> 00:00:20,449
All right, all of you, get up.

7
00:00:23,113 --> 00:00:23,914
Sawyer!

8
00:00:24,008 --> 00:00:26,758
Can you help memake a stretcher?
We're gonna carry him.

9
00:00:29,078 --> 00:00:29,738
Walt!

10
00:00:32,214 --> 00:00:33,445
- Walt!
- Shannon!

11
00:00:40,921 --> 00:00:41,866
Shannon!

12
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:18,037
So how you doing?

13
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,777
Well, the family with
the screaming baby moved.

14
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:24,856
You must be thrilled.

15
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:28,278
Actually, it's...

16
00:01:28,417 --> 00:01:29,792
too quiet now.

17
00:01:35,239 --> 00:01:36,427
So how's Danny?

18
00:01:37,265 --> 00:01:39,261
You two trying to
work things out?

19
00:01:40,196 --> 00:01:41,953
There's nothing to work out.

20
00:01:42,559 --> 00:01:43,363
He left.

21
00:01:45,092 --> 00:01:46,897
You okay with that?

22
00:01:47,502 --> 00:01:51,359
I guess you could say I'm one of those
people who's just better off alone.

23
00:01:55,284 --> 00:01:57,661
So, uh,
how was the firing range?

24
00:01:57,801 --> 00:01:58,650
Good.

25
00:01:59,865 --> 00:02:01,954
How did it feel to
hold a gun again?

26
00:02:02,468 --> 00:02:03,842
Very good.

27
00:02:04,495 --> 00:02:06,825
All these steps count, Ana.

28
00:02:06,918 --> 00:02:09,518
You've come a long way since
we met four months ago.

29
00:02:12,565 --> 00:02:16,469
She say, you know...

30
00:02:17,543 --> 00:02:20,254
when I can come back to work?

31
00:02:21,003 --> 00:02:23,760
She left the final
determination up to me.

32
00:02:23,903 --> 00:02:24,750
Right.

33
00:02:27,459 --> 00:02:29,692
Do you think you're ready?

34
00:02:30,953 --> 00:02:32,711
What do you think?

35
00:02:53,457 --> 00:02:55,691
Welcome back to the force,
officer Cortez.

36
00:03:11,717 --> 00:03:12,376
Sayid!

37
00:03:13,542 --> 00:03:14,489
Sayid, no!

38
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:18,931
- Eko, let him go!
- He's one of us!

39
00:03:19,163 --> 00:03:19,823
No!

40
00:03:21,223 --> 00:03:21,928
Eko!

41
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,789
No! No!

42
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:32,105
Eko!

43
00:03:36,643 --> 00:03:39,732
No! No!

44
00:03:41,677 --> 00:03:42,286
Hey!

45
00:03:43,174 --> 00:03:43,740
Hey!

46
00:03:44,391 --> 00:03:46,815
Don't move! Nobody move!

47
00:04:15,234 --> 00:04:17,992
Nobody move! Nobody!

48
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:21,529
Does he have anything
else on him?

49
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:23,121
What?

50
00:04:23,541 --> 00:04:25,248
He just had a gun to your neck.

51
00:04:26,328 --> 00:04:28,556
Check to see if he has
anything else on him.

52
00:04:28,648 --> 00:04:31,120
- Hey. Put it down.
- Stop.

53
00:04:31,213 --> 00:04:32,699
What are you, crazy?
Don't point that at me!

54
00:04:32,729 --> 00:04:34,961
- I said stop!
- What is your problem, huh?

55
00:04:35,056 --> 00:04:35,664
Ana!

56
00:04:35,803 --> 00:04:37,516
Get back!

57
00:04:37,608 --> 00:04:39,409
Get back, both of you!

58
00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:41,738
- Are you crazy?
- Ana--

59
00:04:41,827 --> 00:04:44,470
- Now!
- Ana!

60
00:04:47,093 --> 00:04:49,134
We need to tie him up.

61
00:04:50,317 --> 00:04:53,270
- I'm not tying him up.
- He tried to kill you.

62
00:04:55,185 --> 00:04:55,897
No.

63
00:05:09,681 --> 00:05:10,578
You.

64
00:05:11,277 --> 00:05:12,367
You do it.

65
00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:16,447
Tie him.

66
00:05:18,295 --> 00:05:19,954
Use the vines from
the stretcher.

67
00:05:20,234 --> 00:05:22,533
Hey, if we take that thing apart,
we won't be able to--

68
00:05:22,563 --> 00:05:23,744
Shut up.

69
00:05:24,398 --> 00:05:27,300
Ana, Sawyer needs a doctor,
or he'll die.

70
00:05:29,262 --> 00:05:30,780
I know what I'm doing.

71
00:05:43,683 --> 00:05:45,200
I hope this is all of it.

72
00:05:46,087 --> 00:05:47,637
That's all we've got right now.

73
00:05:47,837 --> 00:05:48,638
Okay.

74
00:05:49,554 --> 00:05:50,930
Thanks, captain.

75
00:05:54,764 --> 00:05:56,280
Come on in.

76
00:05:58,711 --> 00:06:02,473
Hey. Look who's here. Good to see you,
Ana-Lucia. Welcome back.

77
00:06:02,595 --> 00:06:03,680
Thanks, Raggs.

78
00:06:04,104 --> 00:06:06,190
I'll get you those
I.R.S, captain.

79
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:08,708
- Today.
- You've got it.

80
00:06:11,649 --> 00:06:12,736
How are you?

81
00:06:13,857 --> 00:06:17,571
- Good. Fine.
- Good.

82
00:06:19,207 --> 00:06:20,487
Your assignment.

83
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:27,230
Evidence? You're putting
me behind a desk?

84
00:06:27,323 --> 00:06:29,796
- Is that a problem?
- I want patrol.

85
00:06:30,121 --> 00:06:32,320
- I don't care what you want.
- Just put me in a car.

86
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:35,438
You were in an
officer-involved shooting. No.

87
00:06:37,719 --> 00:06:40,713
You doing this because
you're my captain?

88
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:43,982
Or because you're my mother?

89
00:06:48,469 --> 00:06:49,796
Both.

90
00:06:54,251 --> 00:06:58,260
I need to be back on
the street. Please.

91
00:07:01,179 --> 00:07:02,696
I put you in a car,

92
00:07:02,841 --> 00:07:05,261
everyone's gonna know
that I pulled strings.

93
00:07:05,354 --> 00:07:08,571
You don't want me to treat you like
my daughter? Don't ask for favors.

94
00:07:08,601 --> 00:07:10,104
Then  transfer me.

95
00:07:14,733 --> 00:07:18,254
You don't get the transfer,
but I'll give you the car.

96
00:07:22,134 --> 00:07:23,603
Happy?

97
00:07:24,630 --> 00:07:26,157
Sorry to bother you, captain.

98
00:07:26,242 --> 00:07:29,530
Ana, there's a call for you in the
bullpen. They say it's real important.

99
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:31,841
Thanks, Raggs.
I'll be right there.

100
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:35,658
They got you a cake.

101
00:07:37,052 --> 00:07:38,951
Try and act surprised.

102
00:07:52,695 --> 00:07:57,604
Jack, nice to see you out of the hatch.
You can use more sunshine.

103
00:07:57,751 --> 00:07:59,451
I'll take that
under advisement.

104
00:07:59,545 --> 00:08:01,874
A little fruit might
do you good, too.

105
00:08:02,015 --> 00:08:05,537
Good for the constitution.
At least that's what they say.

106
00:08:05,678 --> 00:08:08,436
Well, if that's
what they say...

107
00:08:11,055 --> 00:08:12,238
Hmm?

108
00:08:13,696 --> 00:08:14,896
Where did you get these?

109
00:08:15,068 --> 00:08:19,068
Now just 'cause you're a little excited,
no reason to talk with your mouth full.

110
00:08:30,812 --> 00:08:33,057
Past the hanging tree,
double or nothing.

111
00:08:34,346 --> 00:08:35,189
You sure?

112
00:08:35,372 --> 00:08:37,811
Dude, double or nothing. There's
no way you're hitting it that far.

113
00:08:37,841 --> 00:08:40,743
Hurley, the woman's
on bloody steroids.

114
00:08:40,896 --> 00:08:42,161
Double's 10,000 bucks.

115
00:08:42,315 --> 00:08:45,155
Oh, that's nothing to someone
who's worth $150 million.

116
00:08:45,294 --> 00:08:47,209
He'll  build you your own
course if you'd like.

117
00:08:47,239 --> 00:08:50,284
- What's he talking about?
- Ignore him. He's an idiot.

118
00:08:53,093 --> 00:08:55,226
- Whoo-hoo-hoo!
- Crap!

119
00:08:56,442 --> 00:08:57,578
You hooked it.

120
00:08:58,744 --> 00:09:00,930
Try keeping your
left arm straight.

121
00:09:02,813 --> 00:09:04,748
You're giving me tips?

122
00:09:04,979 --> 00:09:07,691
Kate, I'm...

123
00:09:08,119 --> 00:09:09,535
I'm a doctor.

124
00:09:10,189 --> 00:09:12,280
So you think you
could do better?

125
00:09:14,288 --> 00:09:17,287
Anyone can hit a ball.
That's not golf.

126
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:19,669
And what's golf?

127
00:09:20,512 --> 00:09:23,782
Golf is accuracy.

128
00:09:26,778 --> 00:09:29,870
Well, why don't we
play a few holes

129
00:09:30,008 --> 00:09:33,103
and see which one of
us is more accurate?

130
00:09:33,195 --> 00:09:34,723
Ooh!

131
00:09:37,845 --> 00:09:39,315
You're kidding, right?

132
00:09:39,827 --> 00:09:42,826
Three holes, no handicap.
We play for bragging rights.

133
00:09:44,508 --> 00:09:46,169
What are we waiting for?

134
00:09:54,817 --> 00:10:00,254
Ana, let's just get to their camp.
It was an accident. They'll understand.

135
00:10:00,344 --> 00:10:04,156
They'll understand?
I killed one of them.

136
00:10:12,524 --> 00:10:15,026
- Those two move? Shout.
- Wait. What are you do--

137
00:10:19,886 --> 00:10:20,979
Untie me.

138
00:10:22,609 --> 00:10:25,081
- I'm not gonna--
- Untie me!

139
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:26,918
Ana!

140
00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:32,964
What are you doing?

141
00:10:35,070 --> 00:10:37,078
I'm taking him
back to his camp.

142
00:10:37,346 --> 00:10:40,579
Don't leave. Please.

143
00:10:40,718 --> 00:10:42,824
If that were you,
he'd let you die.

144
00:10:42,961 --> 00:10:44,806
I'm not doing it for him.

145
00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:47,957
I'm doing it for me.

146
00:11:01,090 --> 00:11:03,467
So that shrink give
you any good drugs?

147
00:11:04,834 --> 00:11:06,721
Not that kind of shrink.

148
00:11:08,031 --> 00:11:10,932
- Did you miss me?
- Boy, did I.

149
00:11:12,754 --> 00:11:14,991
Heard about you and Danny.

150
00:11:16,202 --> 00:11:18,178
Want me to go kick
his ass for you?

151
00:11:19,229 --> 00:11:20,008
Nah.

152
00:11:21,043 --> 00:11:23,412
It's better this way.

153
00:11:25,949 --> 00:11:28,456
What are we doing in Westwood?

154
00:11:29,016 --> 00:11:31,727
Thought a change of
scenery would be nice.

155
00:11:31,968 --> 00:11:34,934
Nice, safe neighborhood
for your first day back.

156
00:11:38,136 --> 00:11:41,858
- This was her idea, wasn't it?
- She is the captain.

157
00:11:42,136 --> 00:11:47,186
8-adam-9, please respond to a domestic
disturbance call. 2210 south veteran.

158
00:11:47,512 --> 00:11:51,859
- This is 8-adam-16.
- That's not our call.

159
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:56,712
We're just three blocks away from
that call on veteran. We got it.

160
00:11:56,856 --> 00:11:58,783
Copy that, 8-adam-16.

161
00:12:03,456 --> 00:12:06,121
Where are you going?!
What are you doing?!

162
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:08,875
Not the TV, Travis.
The tv is mine!

163
00:12:09,499 --> 00:12:11,491
Like hell it is!
I bought it with my money!

164
00:12:11,521 --> 00:12:12,246
Liar!

165
00:12:12,786 --> 00:12:14,686
- Did you call the cops?!
- What?!

166
00:12:14,792 --> 00:12:17,397
Huh?! Do something useful, Shawna.
Shut your trap!

167
00:12:17,487 --> 00:12:19,786
Arrest him!
He is stealing my tv!

168
00:12:19,863 --> 00:12:21,732
- She hit me! She hit me!
- He cannot get away with it!

169
00:12:21,762 --> 00:12:23,189
Hey, enough, both of you!

170
00:12:23,323 --> 00:12:27,085
What are you gonna do?
Take the baby?

171
00:12:27,364 --> 00:12:30,484
- Shut the damn kid up!
- No!

172
00:12:30,553 --> 00:12:31,499
Both of you!

173
00:12:31,636 --> 00:12:34,107
Put your hands
where I can see 'em!

174
00:12:34,251 --> 00:12:36,290
Get down on the ground.

175
00:12:36,850 --> 00:12:38,416
Officer Cortez!

176
00:12:38,612 --> 00:12:40,112
Ma'am, get your baby upstairs.

177
00:12:40,191 --> 00:12:41,064
Ana-lucia!

178
00:12:41,204 --> 00:12:42,438
Get your hands on the ground!

179
00:12:42,468 --> 00:12:43,879
Ana-lucia!

180
00:12:44,625 --> 00:12:46,335
He's down.

181
00:12:46,614 --> 00:12:50,146
Okay, okay. I'm down, I'm down.

182
00:12:50,433 --> 00:12:54,664
Holster your weapon. Now.

183
00:13:05,549 --> 00:13:06,370
Hey...

184
00:13:09,267 --> 00:13:11,317
I think you should let him go.

185
00:13:11,467 --> 00:13:14,219
No. He's gonna come after me.

186
00:13:14,359 --> 00:13:15,926
You don't know that.

187
00:13:16,397 --> 00:13:19,197
I killed someone he loves.

188
00:13:33,205 --> 00:13:36,479
Sit down. Now.

189
00:13:37,441 --> 00:13:39,246
I'm bringing him water.

190
00:13:40,461 --> 00:13:42,326
You gonna shoot me?

191
00:13:42,982 --> 00:13:44,532
Shoot me.

192
00:13:49,768 --> 00:13:52,315
Don't even think
of untying him.

193
00:14:05,755 --> 00:14:07,684
Who  is that woman?

194
00:14:09,433 --> 00:14:13,941
Her name is Ana-Lucia.
She was on the plane.

195
00:14:14,123 --> 00:14:16,700
Tail section. They all were.

196
00:14:16,878 --> 00:14:18,845
We were bringing 'em back.

197
00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:20,592
Where is Walt?

198
00:14:22,448 --> 00:14:23,822
They took him.

199
00:14:25,107 --> 00:14:26,289
The others.

200
00:14:29,767 --> 00:14:31,797
What do you mean,
they took him?

201
00:14:31,936 --> 00:14:36,080
From the raft.
The night we left.

202
00:14:38,979 --> 00:14:40,315
Hey, man--

203
00:14:40,489 --> 00:14:41,292
Shh.

204
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:46,951
Hey, we're gonna get
out of this, man.

205
00:14:56,635 --> 00:14:57,718
Guess you're first.

206
00:14:57,996 --> 00:14:58,657
Lucky me.

207
00:15:02,212 --> 00:15:06,362
You  know, the ladies' tee at my club
back home is about 10 feet closer, so
if you--

208
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:07,501
Shut up, Jack.

209
00:15:21,834 --> 00:15:23,401
Nice.

210
00:15:24,568 --> 00:15:25,753
You're up.

211
00:15:42,518 --> 00:15:43,235
Wow.

212
00:15:44,953 --> 00:15:46,388
You really put it in there.

213
00:15:51,857 --> 00:15:54,327
We have more balls.
You could always just take a drop.

214
00:15:54,357 --> 00:15:55,159
I'm good.

215
00:16:01,070 --> 00:16:02,136
Got it.

216
00:16:16,443 --> 00:16:18,034
You may want to move.

217
00:16:21,799 --> 00:16:22,619
What?

218
00:16:33,909 --> 00:16:35,856
Where is the doctor?

219
00:16:45,459 --> 00:16:47,295
I got him. I got him.

220
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:49,620
- Okay. Where are we headed?
- Bathroom.

221
00:16:52,879 --> 00:16:55,034
He's burning up.
We've got to get him in the shower

222
00:16:55,064 --> 00:16:56,534
and bring his fever down.

223
00:16:57,327 --> 00:16:58,577
What can I do?

224
00:17:01,363 --> 00:17:06,094
Okay. Go through the medical stash.
There's a bottle of Ofloxacin.

225
00:17:06,173 --> 00:17:08,454
- Ofloxacin.
- Ofloxacin, little white pills.

226
00:17:08,547 --> 00:17:10,637
Bring the alcohol and
some gauze patches,

227
00:17:10,784 --> 00:17:14,235
and strip that bed,
make sure it's got clean sheets on it.

228
00:17:16,757 --> 00:17:18,996
- Kate!
- Uh, yeah. Yeah.

229
00:17:27,218 --> 00:17:28,355
What happened?

230
00:17:30,691 --> 00:17:33,618
John... the button.

231
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:02,148
Hello.

232
00:18:05,206 --> 00:18:05,988
Hello.

233
00:18:19,616 --> 00:18:20,318
Hey.

234
00:18:22,977 --> 00:18:24,443
What are we doing here, Ana?

235
00:18:25,926 --> 00:18:28,462
I mean,
their camp has gotta be close.

236
00:18:29,435 --> 00:18:32,472
I just want to get
back to my wife.

237
00:18:35,184 --> 00:18:38,992
How long have I kept you
alive out here, Bernard?

238
00:18:40,122 --> 00:18:41,352
That's right.

239
00:18:42,979 --> 00:18:45,069
So cut me some slack.

240
00:18:45,184 --> 00:18:50,501
Hey. We just want to know what
you're doing. What's the plan?

241
00:18:50,642 --> 00:18:53,090
She has no plan!

242
00:18:53,322 --> 00:18:57,260
She only has her guilt...
and a gun.

243
00:18:58,932 --> 00:19:00,785
You want a plan?

244
00:19:04,196 --> 00:19:06,977
Do you have any ammo
back at your camp?

245
00:19:07,112 --> 00:19:09,288
- What?
- Ammo for the gun.

246
00:19:09,433 --> 00:19:11,468
Do you have any
back at your camp?

247
00:19:11,931 --> 00:19:13,497
Yeah, a couple boxes.

248
00:19:13,635 --> 00:19:17,447
All right. I want it.
At least half.

249
00:19:17,493 --> 00:19:19,582
And I'll need a pack.
A big one.

250
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:22,165
A blanket. Some medicine.

251
00:19:22,288 --> 00:19:24,902
Clothes-- jeans and socks.

252
00:19:25,483 --> 00:19:27,553
- You getting all this?
- Yeah, I got it.

253
00:19:27,668 --> 00:19:32,209
All right.
You bring all of that stuff back to me,

254
00:19:32,741 --> 00:19:35,044
and I'll let your friend go.

255
00:19:35,184 --> 00:19:37,417
Unh-unh. I'm not leaving him.

256
00:19:37,511 --> 00:19:40,529
- Michael, you should.
- No. We stay together.

257
00:19:40,612 --> 00:19:41,354
Go.

258
00:19:53,385 --> 00:19:54,718
I'll be back, man.

259
00:19:56,378 --> 00:20:03,865
Ana, what are you doing?
You can't live out here alone.

260
00:20:05,095 --> 00:20:06,550
I'm already alone.

261
00:20:29,717 --> 00:20:31,052
I'll sign us out.

262
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,358
What, you're talking to me now?

263
00:20:33,506 --> 00:20:35,348
I just want to go home, A.L.

264
00:20:35,489 --> 00:20:38,448
Hey, I ordered that
guy to stop twice.

265
00:20:38,531 --> 00:20:40,396
So does that mean every
time we run into some yo-yo

266
00:20:40,426 --> 00:20:42,995
with a tv in his hands,
you're gonna draw down?

267
00:20:43,119 --> 00:20:47,843
Hey, Ana-Lucia, your guy--
we got him.

268
00:20:54,672 --> 00:20:56,763
His name is Jason McCormack.

269
00:20:56,901 --> 00:21:00,472
We picked him upon an assault on
an elderly woman in Echo Park.

270
00:21:00,674 --> 00:21:03,485
His fingerprints match the
partial from your crime scene.

271
00:21:03,515 --> 00:21:05,315
We questioned him,
and he confessed.

272
00:21:05,367 --> 00:21:09,431
The D.A.'S ready to file charges.
All he needs is for you to I.D. him.

273
00:21:14,222 --> 00:21:17,173
- It's not him.
- He confessed.

274
00:21:17,379 --> 00:21:19,076
I don't know him.

275
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,435
Can you guys give us a minute?

276
00:21:29,615 --> 00:21:31,471
Why are you doing this?

277
00:21:31,619 --> 00:21:33,515
Because it's not him.

278
00:21:34,235 --> 00:21:38,448
He put four bullets into you--
hollow points through your vest.

279
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:40,318
He tried to kill you.

280
00:21:42,641 --> 00:21:44,151
You want a list of his priors?

281
00:21:44,291 --> 00:21:46,691
You want to put this guy
back out on the street?

282
00:21:50,993 --> 00:21:52,536
It's not him.

283
00:22:41,185 --> 00:22:42,639
What happened?

284
00:22:44,507 --> 00:22:46,341
Out there. What happened?

285
00:22:50,556 --> 00:22:51,911
There was an accident.

286
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:54,034
What kind of accident?

287
00:22:54,175 --> 00:22:55,580
A girl was shot...

288
00:22:55,763 --> 00:22:57,090
and killed.

289
00:23:01,392 --> 00:23:03,264
What did she look like?

290
00:23:03,345 --> 00:23:06,918
She was tall, with blond hair.

291
00:23:08,869 --> 00:23:11,351
- There was an Arab man--
- Shannon.

292
00:23:21,768 --> 00:23:24,468
You said there were five of
you from the tail section?

293
00:23:24,496 --> 00:23:25,641
-  Four.
- Four.

294
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:29,512
Why didn't the rest of them come
back with you? And Michael, Jin.

295
00:23:29,653 --> 00:23:32,268
They cannot come
back right now.

296
00:23:33,647 --> 00:23:35,727
Can you take me to them?

297
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:44,760
No.

298
00:23:47,148 --> 00:23:48,165
Here you go.

299
00:23:50,550 --> 00:23:52,572
What's happening?
Why is he shaking?

300
00:23:53,155 --> 00:23:54,287
He's septic.

301
00:23:55,417 --> 00:23:57,712
The infection's gotten
into the bloodstream.

302
00:23:57,829 --> 00:24:01,360
If the antibiotics don't bring the
fever down, he'll go into shock.

303
00:24:03,146 --> 00:24:04,168
Hold him up.

304
00:24:11,527 --> 00:24:13,168
Okay, I got him.

305
00:24:19,759 --> 00:24:22,710
Swallow it. Swallow it.
Swallow it. Damn it.

306
00:24:23,036 --> 00:24:25,558
- Here, I'll do it.
- No, no, I got it.

307
00:24:25,699 --> 00:24:26,741
I  can do it.

308
00:24:33,423 --> 00:24:34,510
Sawyer...

309
00:24:37,783 --> 00:24:38,776
it's Kate.

310
00:24:42,935 --> 00:24:45,127
You need to listen to me, okay?

311
00:24:47,223 --> 00:24:50,920
The only way that you are gonna get
better is if you take this pill.

312
00:24:54,006 --> 00:24:56,430
So I need you to
swallow it, okay?

313
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:02,403
Okay, here we go.

314
00:25:09,647 --> 00:25:10,789
Now swallow.

315
00:25:12,042 --> 00:25:12,926
Swallow.

316
00:25:14,470 --> 00:25:16,940
Good. Good. That's good.

317
00:25:21,661 --> 00:25:22,657
Nice job.

318
00:25:24,476 --> 00:25:28,668
Never learned the whole
whisper-in-the-earthing in med school.

319
00:25:45,688 --> 00:25:47,514
What are you doing?

320
00:25:47,772 --> 00:25:49,340
I'm going, Ana.

321
00:25:50,161 --> 00:25:52,366
I don't want to be
a part of this.

322
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:57,252
I know everything
you've done for us.

323
00:25:58,064 --> 00:26:03,117
And I wouldn't even be alive if it
weren't for you. But I'm going.

324
00:26:06,877 --> 00:26:08,531
What about you?

325
00:26:09,919 --> 00:26:13,634
I just don't think you're
the best judge of character.

326
00:26:14,106 --> 00:26:17,354
I was with you when you
put Nathan in the pit.

327
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:21,889
All right.

328
00:26:24,027 --> 00:26:27,123
You want to go? Go.

329
00:26:29,612 --> 00:26:30,495
Leave.

330
00:26:31,944 --> 00:26:33,234
You...

331
00:26:33,474 --> 00:26:34,937
go.

332
00:26:41,142 --> 00:26:42,433
Get outta here.

333
00:26:45,647 --> 00:26:46,545
Go.

334
00:27:40,236 --> 00:27:41,284
Michael!

335
00:27:44,595 --> 00:27:46,449
Hey. Hey, Sun.

336
00:27:46,597 --> 00:27:49,120
It's all right. Jin is okay.

337
00:27:49,201 --> 00:27:51,120
What happened? Where is he?

338
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:53,795
He's fine, and I'll explain.

339
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:57,151
But right now I
need to find Jack.

340
00:28:01,528 --> 00:28:02,827
Where are they?

341
00:28:09,569 --> 00:28:12,369
I said... where are they?

342
00:28:12,533 --> 00:28:15,931
- Jack, it's not his fault--
- Shannon's dead! I'm not...

343
00:28:21,365 --> 00:28:24,029
You're gonna take me back
out there right now.

344
00:28:24,174 --> 00:28:26,813
This man isn't the problem.
He brought Sawyer back.

345
00:28:26,907 --> 00:28:30,200
Half-dead, with a bullet hole
through his shoulder, John!

346
00:28:33,463 --> 00:28:36,363
Are you gonna talk to me,
or are you just gonna sit there?

347
00:28:37,895 --> 00:28:41,868
Anything I say will
only make you angry.

348
00:28:45,459 --> 00:28:49,423
So, yes, I will sit here.

349
00:28:50,328 --> 00:28:51,133
Jack!

350
00:28:52,812 --> 00:28:54,966
Jack! Jack!

351
00:28:58,555 --> 00:29:00,021
Michael.

352
00:29:02,733 --> 00:29:04,631
We got a problem, man.

353
00:29:11,692 --> 00:29:13,426
You remember how to
get out there, right?

354
00:29:13,456 --> 00:29:14,306
Yeah, I think so.

355
00:29:14,366 --> 00:29:16,280
We should stop and
think about this, Jack.

356
00:29:16,310 --> 00:29:18,498
Think about what, John?
Shannon's dead.

357
00:29:18,645 --> 00:29:20,195
Sayid's being held at gunpoint.

358
00:29:20,266 --> 00:29:23,316
You want to sit here and hope
that situation resolves itself?

359
00:29:23,750 --> 00:29:25,269
You be my guest.

360
00:29:25,987 --> 00:29:28,191
- Know how to use this?
- Guess so.

361
00:29:29,265 --> 00:29:30,331
Stop!

362
00:29:33,328 --> 00:29:34,327
Please.

363
00:29:37,393 --> 00:29:38,678
What do you want?

364
00:29:39,872 --> 00:29:40,825
Excuse me?

365
00:29:41,274 --> 00:29:47,655
Peace? Revenge? Justice? And you
are going out with all these guns.

366
00:29:48,061 --> 00:29:49,161
What do you want?

367
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:51,448
I want all of our people
back here safely.

368
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:55,487
- Your friend murdered--
- Ana-Lucia made a mistake.

369
00:29:56,467 --> 00:29:58,061
What did you say?

370
00:29:59,278 --> 00:30:01,429
Ana-Lucia made a mistake.

371
00:30:05,610 --> 00:30:07,094
Ana-Lucia.

372
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:19,752
I will take you there.

373
00:30:20,170 --> 00:30:22,077
But only you.

374
00:30:22,782 --> 00:30:24,571
And no guns.

375
00:30:34,886 --> 00:30:36,470
Let's go.

376
00:30:43,484 --> 00:30:44,501
Where you from?

377
00:30:54,522 --> 00:30:55,860
Where are you from?

378
00:30:59,458 --> 00:31:01,106
I am from Iraq.

379
00:31:04,637 --> 00:31:06,991
You have any kids?

380
00:31:10,322 --> 00:31:12,777
Why are you asking me
if I have children?

381
00:31:13,037 --> 00:31:14,329
I'm curious.

382
00:31:14,721 --> 00:31:17,410
I do not. Do you have children?

383
00:31:18,233 --> 00:31:19,168
No.

384
00:31:19,863 --> 00:31:21,773
Are you going to kill me?

385
00:31:24,387 --> 00:31:27,152
That's what you're thinking about,
isn't it?

386
00:31:27,333 --> 00:31:28,947
Should I?

387
00:31:32,993 --> 00:31:37,331
Almost 40 days ago,
on this very island,

388
00:31:37,964 --> 00:31:41,606
I tied a man to a tree,
and I tortured him.

389
00:31:43,144 --> 00:31:47,073
I tortured him,
as I've tortured many men...

390
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:51,735
men whose voices I
still hear at night.

391
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,077
Should you kill me?

392
00:31:58,872 --> 00:32:01,051
Maybe you should.

393
00:32:02,611 --> 00:32:05,848
Maybe you were meant to.

394
00:32:21,090 --> 00:32:22,469
I'm a cop.

395
00:32:25,191 --> 00:32:28,876
Well... I was a cop.

396
00:32:31,164 --> 00:32:36,392
One night, my partner and I
responded to a burglary call.

397
00:32:36,652 --> 00:32:38,660
We were the first ones there.

398
00:32:38,775 --> 00:32:43,202
I covered the front,
and he went around the back.

399
00:32:46,696 --> 00:32:48,959
I was there a minute.

400
00:32:49,413 --> 00:32:52,817
Then this kid comes right
through the front door.

401
00:32:53,009 --> 00:32:55,574
I tell him to put his hands up.

402
00:32:55,738 --> 00:32:58,991
And he says I'm
making a mistake,

403
00:32:59,085 --> 00:33:01,220
that he's a student.

404
00:33:02,244 --> 00:33:05,725
And he wants to
show me his I.D.

405
00:33:07,445 --> 00:33:09,532
I believed him.

406
00:33:11,023 --> 00:33:12,651
I just...

407
00:33:14,474 --> 00:33:18,380
I let him reach.

408
00:33:20,959 --> 00:33:23,760
All I remember was a pop.

409
00:33:23,997 --> 00:33:27,181
By the time I hit the ground,
I thought I was dead.

410
00:33:31,342 --> 00:33:34,822
I feel dead.

411
00:33:39,026 --> 00:33:43,653
What happened to him--
the man who shot you?

412
00:34:26,284 --> 00:34:27,069
Hey!

413
00:34:28,815 --> 00:34:29,983
Jason.

414
00:34:40,171 --> 00:34:41,992
I know you?

415
00:34:44,688 --> 00:34:46,835
I was pregnant.

416
00:35:04,913 --> 00:35:06,297
What happened to him?

417
00:35:16,109 --> 00:35:19,472
Nothing. They never found him.

418
00:35:47,849 --> 00:35:49,448
Go ahead.

419
00:35:53,330 --> 00:35:54,608
Pick it up.

420
00:35:56,663 --> 00:35:58,599
I deserve it.

421
00:36:07,778 --> 00:36:10,676
What good would it
be to kill you...

422
00:36:12,195 --> 00:36:15,431
if we're both already dead?

423
00:37:14,446 --> 00:37:15,505
Hey.

424
00:37:17,186 --> 00:37:19,363
Hey. Can you hear me?

425
00:37:23,610 --> 00:37:25,150
You're gonna be okay.

426
00:37:29,066 --> 00:37:30,942
You're gonna be all right.

427
00:37:33,344 --> 00:37:34,430
You're home.
