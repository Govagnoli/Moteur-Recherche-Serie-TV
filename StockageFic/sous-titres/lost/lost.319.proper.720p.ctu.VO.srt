00:00:00,744 --> 00:00:02,167
<i>Previously on</i> Lost...

2
00:00:02,685 --> 00:00:04,012
You stole my kidney.

3
00:00:04,249 --> 00:00:06,415
You need a father, and I need a kidney.

4
00:00:06,688 --> 00:00:07,688
Get over it.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,685
I know you were raised in foster care.

6
00:00:15,766 --> 00:00:17,126
I know you spent the four years

7
00:00:17,201 --> 00:00:19,410
prior to your arrival
on this island in a wheelchair,

8
00:00:19,487 --> 00:00:21,334
and I know how you ended up in it.

9
00:00:21,373 --> 00:00:23,836
What if I told you
that somewhere on this island,

10
00:00:24,005 --> 00:00:26,200
there's a very large box,

11
00:00:27,373 --> 00:00:30,517
and whatever you imagined,
whatever you wanted to be in it,

12
00:00:31,474 --> 00:00:34,945
when you opened that box,
there it would be?

13
00:00:35,302 --> 00:00:38,956
I'd say I hope that box is big enough
to imagine yourself up new submarine.

14
00:00:46,699 --> 00:00:48,735
Well, John, you've really gone
and done it now.

15
00:00:48,801 --> 00:00:51,689
You're not gonna start talking about
the magic box again, are you?

16
00:00:51,811 --> 00:00:54,922
No, John. I'm gonna show you
what came out of it.

17
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:58,560
Dad?

18
00:01:21,437 --> 00:01:22,437
Save your breath.

19
00:01:25,419 --> 00:01:26,751
Nobody's gonna hear you.

20
00:01:42,312 --> 00:01:43,312
Dad?

21
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:49,454
What is this?

22
00:01:49,501 --> 00:01:52,556
You tell me. You brought him here.

23
00:01:52,872 --> 00:01:54,153
I didn't bring him here.

24
00:01:54,247 --> 00:01:56,972
I'd be careful about getting
too close to him, John.

25
00:01:57,692 --> 00:02:00,373
Well, where did you find him?
Why did you bring him here?

26
00:02:00,441 --> 00:02:02,805
I've already said... We didn't...

27
00:02:02,876 --> 00:02:04,521
You want me to ask him how he got here?

28
00:02:04,589 --> 00:02:05,606
Be my guest.

29
00:02:11,098 --> 00:02:12,600
I warned you, John.

30
00:02:15,372 --> 00:02:16,579
Don't you know, John?

31
00:02:17,436 --> 00:02:19,578
Don't you know where we are?

32
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:26,495
What did he mean?

33
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:29,388
I'm afraid we don't have time
to deal with that right now, John.

34
00:02:29,939 --> 00:02:32,081
We're leaving
first thing in the morning, all of us.

35
00:02:32,122 --> 00:02:33,233
Where are you going?

36
00:02:35,249 --> 00:02:36,749
We're going to a new place.

37
00:02:38,247 --> 00:02:39,858
Well, an old place, actually.

38
00:02:41,812 --> 00:02:43,534
Would you like to come with us?

39
00:02:49,875 --> 00:02:50,875
Yes.

40
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:52,060
Good.

41
00:02:54,187 --> 00:02:56,743
We're holding Kate
a few buildings over from here.

42
00:02:56,999 --> 00:02:58,689
Maybe you'd like to say good-bye.

43
00:03:22,716 --> 00:03:24,063
Hey, where you going?

44
00:03:25,561 --> 00:03:27,671
I can't sleep if I'm not in my own tent.

45
00:03:28,057 --> 00:03:30,618
Fine. Let's go to your tent.

46
00:03:37,186 --> 00:03:38,852
It's nothing personal. It's...

47
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:41,666
old habits, you know?

48
00:03:45,435 --> 00:03:46,775
Fine. Scram.

49
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:50,921
You want me to walk you home?

50
00:03:52,123 --> 00:03:54,102
It's five tents. I think I'll make it.

51
00:03:54,824 --> 00:03:57,423
Are you sure? I gotta pee anyway.

52
00:03:58,849 --> 00:04:00,510
That is so romantic.

53
00:04:23,375 --> 00:04:24,819
What the hell y'all doin'?

54
00:04:26,937 --> 00:04:28,270
What the hell you doing?

55
00:04:28,873 --> 00:04:30,039
Going to take a leak.

56
00:04:31,811 --> 00:04:33,033
Yeah, well, so are we.

57
00:04:36,562 --> 00:04:37,784
Well, all righty then.

58
00:05:03,062 --> 00:05:04,062
Hello, James.

59
00:05:12,258 --> 00:05:15,908
Subtitles: swsub.com

60
00:05:25,934 --> 00:05:27,489
You wanna zip your pants up?

61
00:05:29,871 --> 00:05:31,433
What the hell are you doing here?

62
00:05:31,532 --> 00:05:32,878
Looking for you, actually.

63
00:05:34,748 --> 00:05:36,108
Okay, Tarzan.

64
00:05:36,183 --> 00:05:38,210
Now that you're back from your
"blow up everything

65
00:05:38,239 --> 00:05:39,815
that could get us off the island" tour,

66
00:05:39,865 --> 00:05:42,261
how 'bout you tell me why
you joined up with the damn enemy?

67
00:05:42,308 --> 00:05:45,028
I didn't join 'em. I infiltrated 'em.

68
00:05:45,997 --> 00:05:48,406
- You're undercover with the others.
- That's right.

69
00:05:48,498 --> 00:05:51,016
Now how 'bout you give me
one reason to believe that?

70
00:05:51,929 --> 00:05:52,998
Because a few hours ago

71
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:55,309
I snuck into Ben's tent
and kidnapped him.

72
00:05:58,238 --> 00:06:00,919
I tied him up,
dragged him off into the jungle.

73
00:06:02,607 --> 00:06:05,445
And you came all the way back here
to tell me this because...

74
00:06:05,499 --> 00:06:07,765
Because this is the same man
who tortured you,

75
00:06:07,972 --> 00:06:09,610
beat you, humiliated you...

76
00:06:11,058 --> 00:06:12,756
And I want you...

77
00:06:13,297 --> 00:06:14,549
to kill him.

78
00:06:19,988 --> 00:06:21,574
You want him dead, you kill him.

79
00:06:21,686 --> 00:06:23,408
- I'm not a murder.
- Neither am I!

80
00:06:23,998 --> 00:06:25,977
Except for the man you killed in Sydney.

81
00:06:28,059 --> 00:06:29,725
They got files on us, James...

82
00:06:30,936 --> 00:06:31,936
All of us.

83
00:06:33,809 --> 00:06:35,841
Yeah, well,
their files got their facts wrong.

84
00:06:42,808 --> 00:06:44,573
Then I made a mistake coming to you.

85
00:06:51,247 --> 00:06:53,272
Please don't tell anyone
that I was here.

86
00:06:54,558 --> 00:06:55,558
Hey, stop!

87
00:06:56,496 --> 00:06:57,496
I said stop!

88
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:02,378
Damn it! Wait up!

89
00:07:19,166 --> 00:07:21,890
There. That ought to do it.

90
00:07:22,246 --> 00:07:23,246
Thanks.

91
00:07:23,934 --> 00:07:26,071
That would've taken me hours
to do myself.

92
00:07:26,871 --> 00:07:27,871
Glad I could help.

93
00:07:31,807 --> 00:07:32,807
Don't mind them.

94
00:07:33,056 --> 00:07:35,111
They're all just excited you're here.

95
00:07:35,372 --> 00:07:36,372
Excited?

96
00:07:36,993 --> 00:07:38,493
We've been waiting for you.

97
00:07:39,868 --> 00:07:41,768
John, you got a minute?

98
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:44,536
Ben's asking for you.

99
00:07:45,871 --> 00:07:46,871
Okay.

100
00:07:50,275 --> 00:07:52,485
<i>Ben, it's 6:00 a.m. on saturday morning.</i>

101
00:07:52,585 --> 00:07:54,652
<i>Kwon is pregnant.
The fetus is healthy</i>

102
00:07:54,716 --> 00:07:57,405
<i>and was conceived on island
with her husband.</i>

103
00:07:57,583 --> 00:07:59,112
<i>He was sterile when they got here.</i>

104
00:08:01,119 --> 00:08:02,841
Hello, John. Thanks for coming.

105
00:08:04,437 --> 00:08:05,450
What's that?

106
00:08:05,495 --> 00:08:08,367
Juliet is gathering information for us
at your former camp.

107
00:08:09,373 --> 00:08:11,681
She's determing
if any of the women are pregnant.

108
00:08:11,872 --> 00:08:13,483
Then we're gonna go in and...

109
00:08:14,408 --> 00:08:15,412
take them.

110
00:08:17,055 --> 00:08:18,055
Take them?

111
00:08:19,896 --> 00:08:21,869
This is not the first time
we've done this.

112
00:08:21,932 --> 00:08:23,654
Trust me, no one will get hurt.

113
00:08:25,805 --> 00:08:27,527
Could you pass me that, please?

114
00:08:31,796 --> 00:08:32,819
Thank you.

115
00:08:36,609 --> 00:08:39,377
I believe
I have you to thank for this, John.

116
00:08:39,842 --> 00:08:42,600
- Me?
- A week ago, I couldn't move my toes...

117
00:08:45,121 --> 00:08:46,794
But the minute you showed up,

118
00:08:47,745 --> 00:08:50,213
I started to feel pins and needles.

119
00:08:51,307 --> 00:08:53,126
And this is only the beginning, John.

120
00:08:53,305 --> 00:08:55,620
I can't wait to show you
what this island can do,

121
00:08:56,793 --> 00:08:57,904
but unfortunately,

122
00:08:58,622 --> 00:09:00,053
you're not ready, John.

123
00:09:02,998 --> 00:09:05,119
- No, I'm ready.
- No, John, you're not.

124
00:09:06,362 --> 00:09:08,429
You're still crippled by the memories

125
00:09:08,526 --> 00:09:11,312
of the man you used to be
before you came to this island,

126
00:09:11,872 --> 00:09:13,205
and you'll never be free

127
00:09:13,495 --> 00:09:16,209
until you release
the hold that your father has over you.

128
00:09:18,678 --> 00:09:20,411
Why do you think you brought him here?

129
00:09:22,638 --> 00:09:24,290
The magic box.

130
00:09:24,683 --> 00:09:26,518
Okay, Ben, how about you show me...

131
00:09:26,631 --> 00:09:28,275
"Magic box" is a metaphor, John.

132
00:09:28,493 --> 00:09:30,881
I can't show you anything
until you can show me

133
00:09:30,933 --> 00:09:32,936
that you're ready
and willing to be one of us.

134
00:09:33,243 --> 00:09:36,877
When people join us here on this island,
they need to make a gesture

135
00:09:36,994 --> 00:09:39,737
of free will, of commitment.

136
00:09:42,432 --> 00:09:44,576
That's why
you're gonna have to kill your father.

137
00:10:10,677 --> 00:10:11,709
When did you get back?

138
00:10:13,214 --> 00:10:14,223
Last night.

139
00:10:14,305 --> 00:10:15,782
Well, early this morning.

140
00:10:16,869 --> 00:10:19,024
So... camping, huh?

141
00:10:20,532 --> 00:10:21,977
What were you guys doing out there?

142
00:10:23,055 --> 00:10:25,443
We...
figured we'd explore a bit, you know.

143
00:10:25,558 --> 00:10:27,558
See what was further down the beach.

144
00:10:28,430 --> 00:10:29,430
Male bonding.

145
00:10:30,059 --> 00:10:33,558
Well, next time you go out, sign me up.

146
00:10:33,808 --> 00:10:35,231
Yeah, next time. Sure.

147
00:10:47,627 --> 00:10:48,807
Thanks, Jin.

148
00:10:50,995 --> 00:10:52,106
We have to tell Jack.

149
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:54,306
Yeah, I mean,
shouldn't he check out her wound?

150
00:10:54,396 --> 00:10:56,788
Can you give me your word
that Jack can be trusted?

151
00:10:57,030 --> 00:11:00,240
That he spent ten days with those people
and that nothing happened to him?

152
00:11:00,305 --> 00:11:02,305
And that woman
he's spending all his time with...

153
00:11:02,354 --> 00:11:04,007
- Juliet.
- Aye. Juliet.

154
00:11:04,289 --> 00:11:06,456
Two weeks ago,
she had your friends in cages.

155
00:11:08,745 --> 00:11:09,749
Naomi...

156
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:12,068
Well, you heard
everything that she said.

157
00:11:13,056 --> 00:11:14,167
If we keep her safe,

158
00:11:15,621 --> 00:11:17,416
she's our way off this island.

159
00:11:19,372 --> 00:11:20,457
So given that,

160
00:11:20,672 --> 00:11:21,932
do you trust Jack,

161
00:11:23,086 --> 00:11:24,109
or don't you?

162
00:11:28,682 --> 00:11:29,682
Right.

163
00:11:30,872 --> 00:11:33,168
So we better bring in
someone we can trust.

164
00:11:42,721 --> 00:11:44,498
You should've put some shoes on.

165
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:45,970
You think?

166
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:49,693
So what else is in it?

167
00:11:50,846 --> 00:11:51,846
In what?

168
00:11:53,596 --> 00:11:54,929
The file they got on me.

169
00:11:56,594 --> 00:11:57,594
Not much.

170
00:11:58,970 --> 00:12:01,396
That your parents died
when you were very young.

171
00:12:02,536 --> 00:12:03,758
But it doesn't say why

172
00:12:04,284 --> 00:12:05,508
your father...

173
00:12:06,356 --> 00:12:07,488
shot your mother...

174
00:12:10,531 --> 00:12:12,531
or why he turned the gun on himself.

175
00:12:18,658 --> 00:12:20,380
That must've been hard for you.

176
00:12:31,469 --> 00:12:32,469
What else?

177
00:12:32,656 --> 00:12:34,075
High school transcripts...

178
00:12:34,759 --> 00:12:35,845
criminal record...

179
00:12:36,594 --> 00:12:38,760
all the con jobs you were arrested for.

180
00:12:39,283 --> 00:12:41,544
I guess that's why
you use an alias, huh?

181
00:12:41,791 --> 00:12:43,479
Why did you choose the name Sawyer?

182
00:12:45,156 --> 00:12:46,686
How stupid do you think I am?

183
00:12:47,017 --> 00:12:48,669
I already been conned by Ben once.

184
00:12:48,772 --> 00:12:51,342
Maybe you heard about it...
bunny with a number painted on it?

185
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:53,625
You think I'm just gonna follow you
through the jungle?

186
00:12:53,672 --> 00:12:55,652
Please, you have to...
You have to trust me.

187
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,576
Where are you taking me?
Tell me the truth!

188
00:12:57,611 --> 00:12:58,615
What do you want from me?

189
00:12:58,662 --> 00:13:01,036
I'm bringing you there
to do exactly what I said...

190
00:13:01,159 --> 00:13:03,466
- To kill Ben.
- Why did you come back to get me?

191
00:13:03,533 --> 00:13:04,871
- I had to.
- Why me?!

192
00:13:04,906 --> 00:13:06,226
Why won't you do it yourself?

193
00:13:06,283 --> 00:13:08,216
- James, please...
- Don't call me James!

194
00:13:08,782 --> 00:13:10,643
Why won't you do it yourself?

195
00:13:10,719 --> 00:13:13,767
Because I can't! I can't!
I can't do it!

196
00:13:18,091 --> 00:13:19,799
That's why I came back for you.

197
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:30,719
Get up.

198
00:13:36,907 --> 00:13:38,372
I'll go to wherever you got him,

199
00:13:38,675 --> 00:13:40,561
but then
we're bringing him back to our camp.

200
00:13:40,658 --> 00:13:42,786
I ain't killing nobody.
You understand me?

201
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:46,499
Yeah. I understand...

202
00:13:48,667 --> 00:13:50,088
But you'll change your mind

203
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:56,887
When you hear what he has to say,

204
00:13:59,157 --> 00:14:00,583
you'll change your mind.

205
00:14:18,885 --> 00:14:19,945
Hey, dude.

206
00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:22,760
Hello, Hurley.

207
00:14:33,836 --> 00:14:35,058
Can you keep a secret?

208
00:14:43,339 --> 00:14:44,746
You've already spoken to her?

209
00:14:44,897 --> 00:14:47,594
Yeah, but you're gonna want
to hear it for yourself.

210
00:14:47,957 --> 00:14:49,401
And you haven't told Jack?

211
00:14:50,206 --> 00:14:51,206
No.

212
00:14:51,645 --> 00:14:52,645
Good.

213
00:15:05,052 --> 00:15:06,469
My name's Sayid Jarrah.

214
00:15:06,898 --> 00:15:09,244
I understand your helicopter
crashed onto the island.

215
00:15:09,395 --> 00:15:11,283
Actually, it crashed in the water.

216
00:15:12,708 --> 00:15:13,708
What's your name?

217
00:15:14,082 --> 00:15:16,162
Naomi. Naomi Dorrit.

218
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:19,022
Naomi, from where exactly
did you take off?

219
00:15:19,456 --> 00:15:21,329
A ship... freighter...

220
00:15:21,835 --> 00:15:23,890
About 80 nautical miles west of here.

221
00:15:24,457 --> 00:15:26,308
I'm part of a search and recovery team.

222
00:15:26,769 --> 00:15:30,213
You told my friends the wreckage
of flight 815 was discovered.

223
00:15:30,646 --> 00:15:32,195
Did you mean the partial wreckage?

224
00:15:32,521 --> 00:15:36,371
No. They found the entire plane
off the coast of Bali,

225
00:15:36,661 --> 00:15:38,438
in an ocean trench 4 miles deep.

226
00:15:39,347 --> 00:15:42,723
They sent down cameras in these
little robots to survey the wreck.

227
00:15:43,598 --> 00:15:45,042
The bodies were all there.

228
00:15:48,473 --> 00:15:50,718
Well, obviously we're not dead.

229
00:15:52,067 --> 00:15:53,146
Obviously.

230
00:15:53,319 --> 00:15:54,933
So if you weren't looking for us,

231
00:15:55,097 --> 00:15:56,537
then who were you looking for?

232
00:15:57,411 --> 00:15:58,411
Him.

233
00:16:00,661 --> 00:16:01,661
Desmond?

234
00:16:01,801 --> 00:16:04,729
My company was hired by a woman
named Penelope Widmore.

235
00:16:04,911 --> 00:16:06,814
I don't know why. I never met her.

236
00:16:06,975 --> 00:16:08,609
She gave us a set of coordinates.

237
00:16:09,286 --> 00:16:12,539
We've been conducting a differential
G.P.S. grid search ever since.

238
00:16:13,536 --> 00:16:15,095
You knew about the island?

239
00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:16,405
Island?

240
00:16:16,713 --> 00:16:19,260
We were given coordinates
in the middle of the bloody ocean.

241
00:16:19,598 --> 00:16:21,252
We thought it was a fool's errand...

242
00:16:21,541 --> 00:16:22,812
till three days ago.

243
00:16:23,641 --> 00:16:25,784
I was flying back for the ship,
when all of a sudden

244
00:16:25,785 --> 00:16:27,729
the clouds cleared, and I saw land.

245
00:16:28,521 --> 00:16:30,078
The instruments started spinning.

246
00:16:30,350 --> 00:16:33,661
I realized I was going down,
so I grabbed my chute, and I bailed.

247
00:16:38,388 --> 00:16:40,311
Did you actually see her helicopter?

248
00:16:42,098 --> 00:16:43,098
No.

249
00:16:43,546 --> 00:16:44,887
You think I'm lying, mate?

250
00:16:45,036 --> 00:16:46,785
I take it you have no means whatsoever

251
00:16:46,848 --> 00:16:48,959
of communicating
with that freighter of yours?

252
00:16:51,037 --> 00:16:53,190
What was your name? Sayid?

253
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:54,660
Yes.

254
00:17:05,036 --> 00:17:06,980
Remind me not to rescue you, Sayid.

255
00:17:34,804 --> 00:17:36,075
So Ben...

256
00:17:36,403 --> 00:17:38,849
You said I'd kill him
when I heard what he's got to say.

257
00:17:39,472 --> 00:17:41,810
- That's right.
- Well, you wanna give me a heads-up?

258
00:17:42,785 --> 00:17:44,573
It's not really my place to tell you.

259
00:17:48,534 --> 00:17:51,237
Look, what you read in that file...

260
00:17:52,723 --> 00:17:54,167
about the guy in Sydney...

261
00:17:55,658 --> 00:17:57,209
I thought he was someone else.

262
00:17:57,412 --> 00:17:59,568
I made a mistake.
I didn't mean to kill him.

263
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:03,210
Well, who'd you mean to kill?

264
00:18:12,096 --> 00:18:13,207
Are we almost there?

265
00:18:15,779 --> 00:18:16,839
Almost.

266
00:18:31,347 --> 00:18:32,347
Wake up, John.

267
00:18:34,974 --> 00:18:35,974
It's time.

268
00:19:07,367 --> 00:19:10,486
I know it won't be easy,
but the quicker the better.

269
00:19:15,159 --> 00:19:16,547
You're kidding me, right?

270
00:19:18,098 --> 00:19:20,251
You expect him to kill me?

271
00:19:25,848 --> 00:19:28,234
The hesitation that you're feeling
is just the part of you

272
00:19:28,281 --> 00:19:31,170
that still feels like
he has a perfectly good explanation

273
00:19:31,217 --> 00:19:32,514
for stealing your kidney,

274
00:19:33,450 --> 00:19:35,232
throwing you out of an 8-story window.

275
00:19:36,224 --> 00:19:38,057
Don't you wanna be free from him?

276
00:19:38,597 --> 00:19:42,435
The hesitation he's feeling
is because he is a spineless...

277
00:19:42,503 --> 00:19:43,599
Shut up!

278
00:19:51,931 --> 00:19:53,882
- I gotta think...
- Don't think, John.

279
00:19:53,973 --> 00:19:55,710
You're wasting your time, bug-eye.

280
00:19:56,159 --> 00:19:57,709
Me and him have been through all this.

281
00:19:57,844 --> 00:20:00,931
- All he wants is his daddy...
- Shut up! I said shut up!

282
00:20:05,311 --> 00:20:08,182
You really haven't figured it out yet,
have you?

283
00:20:10,583 --> 00:20:12,816
Let go of him, John.

284
00:20:15,783 --> 00:20:16,970
Why are you doing this to me?

285
00:20:17,096 --> 00:20:20,596
You're doing this to yourself.
As long as he's still breathing,

286
00:20:20,722 --> 00:20:24,010
you'll still be
that same sad, pathetic little man

287
00:20:24,095 --> 00:20:26,337
that was kicked off his walkabout tour

288
00:20:26,778 --> 00:20:29,049
because you couldn't walk.

289
00:20:53,286 --> 00:20:56,878
I'll be here the rest of the week, John,
if you change your mind...

290
00:21:13,174 --> 00:21:14,223
I'm sorry.

291
00:21:17,161 --> 00:21:18,883
He's not who we thought he was.

292
00:22:11,473 --> 00:22:12,473
Son of a...

293
00:22:23,381 --> 00:22:25,194
Nice place you got here, Locke.

294
00:22:27,729 --> 00:22:29,235
Ben's inside in the brig.

295
00:22:30,473 --> 00:22:31,473
You ready?

296
00:22:33,972 --> 00:22:34,972
Yeah, I'm ready.

297
00:22:56,377 --> 00:22:57,503
Friends of yours?

298
00:22:58,257 --> 00:23:01,522
It's an old slaving ship,
mid nineteenth century,

299
00:23:08,644 --> 00:23:10,011
My guess is they...

300
00:23:10,264 --> 00:23:13,640
captured the slaves and brought them
here to try and mine the island.

301
00:23:17,759 --> 00:23:18,958
What's in the boxes?

302
00:23:19,348 --> 00:23:20,403
That'd be dynamite.

303
00:23:26,472 --> 00:23:27,727
Son of a bitch.

304
00:23:28,783 --> 00:23:30,724
You really kidnapped the little bastard.

305
00:23:35,371 --> 00:23:36,853
We ain't killin' him, Locke.

306
00:23:38,786 --> 00:23:40,119
Whatever you say, James.

307
00:23:59,782 --> 00:24:00,972
Well, well, well.

308
00:24:05,472 --> 00:24:07,339
What are you doing?!
Open the damn door!

309
00:24:07,623 --> 00:24:08,784
Shut up!

310
00:24:09,006 --> 00:24:10,158
Open up!

311
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,885
I said shut up!

312
00:24:19,864 --> 00:24:21,137
Who the hell are you?

313
00:24:25,330 --> 00:24:27,910
- It's like a radio?
- It's like a radio, yes,

314
00:24:28,515 --> 00:24:30,752
but I've never seen
equipment this sophisticated.

315
00:24:31,142 --> 00:24:32,684
But you can still make it work, right?

316
00:24:32,827 --> 00:24:33,827
I hope so.

317
00:24:35,953 --> 00:24:37,401
And what about the other part?

318
00:24:38,390 --> 00:24:40,793
The part about they found the plane
and we're all dead?

319
00:24:41,516 --> 00:24:42,627
One thing at a time.

320
00:24:50,150 --> 00:24:51,988
There's not a single audible channel.

321
00:24:52,303 --> 00:24:53,963
Whatever that interference is,

322
00:24:54,164 --> 00:24:56,857
it's blocking our ability
to send our own transmission.

323
00:24:57,325 --> 00:24:58,325
If we...

324
00:24:58,638 --> 00:25:00,527
What's that? Is that a radio?

325
00:25:02,202 --> 00:25:03,257
Where'd you get it?

326
00:25:03,721 --> 00:25:04,791
Uh, the luggage.

327
00:25:05,142 --> 00:25:07,366
What, you just found a radio
in the luggage?

328
00:25:07,451 --> 00:25:11,807
Kate, if I explain,
I want you to keep this very quiet.

329
00:25:13,263 --> 00:25:14,429
Keep what very quiet?

330
00:25:17,405 --> 00:25:20,050
Locke! Open the damn door!

331
00:25:20,638 --> 00:25:23,947
Open it up! I can hear you,
you bald bastard!

332
00:25:29,889 --> 00:25:30,889
Rousseau?

333
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:33,200
Locke.

334
00:25:35,516 --> 00:25:37,143
What brings you to "The Black Rock"?

335
00:25:37,449 --> 00:25:39,474
Dynamite. And you?

336
00:25:40,055 --> 00:25:41,263
Open this door!

337
00:25:43,452 --> 00:25:44,452
Open up!

338
00:25:48,953 --> 00:25:50,508
Crates are right over there.

339
00:25:54,191 --> 00:25:55,437
Open this damn door!

340
00:25:55,575 --> 00:25:57,146
Be careful. It's unstable.

341
00:26:19,286 --> 00:26:20,517
It's beautiful, isn't it?

342
00:26:21,577 --> 00:26:23,537
No matter how much time
you spend on the island,

343
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:25,129
you just never get tired of this view.

344
00:26:25,326 --> 00:26:27,503
We haven't been formally introduced.

345
00:26:27,576 --> 00:26:28,576
I'm Richard.

346
00:26:30,699 --> 00:26:32,861
- You mind if I join you?
- Oh, sure.

347
00:26:39,889 --> 00:26:41,389
He wanted to embarrass you.

348
00:26:42,512 --> 00:26:43,512
I'm sorry?

349
00:26:43,826 --> 00:26:46,017
Ben knew you weren't gonna kill
your own father.

350
00:26:47,542 --> 00:26:48,723
He put you in front of

351
00:26:49,259 --> 00:26:52,439
everyone in our camp
just so they could all watch you fail.

352
00:26:53,951 --> 00:26:54,951
Why?

353
00:26:58,766 --> 00:27:00,210
'cause when word got back here

354
00:27:00,275 --> 00:27:02,825
that there was a man
with a broken spine on the plane

355
00:27:02,901 --> 00:27:05,124
who could suddenly walk again, well...

356
00:27:05,388 --> 00:27:08,388
People here began to get very excited,
because that...

357
00:27:09,952 --> 00:27:12,882
That could only happen to someone
who was extremely special.

358
00:27:15,641 --> 00:27:18,533
Now Ben doesn't want anyone
to think you're special, John.

359
00:27:19,077 --> 00:27:20,458
And why are you telling me this?

360
00:27:22,181 --> 00:27:23,939
Ben has been wasting our time

361
00:27:23,988 --> 00:27:27,075
with novelties like fertility problems.

362
00:27:28,076 --> 00:27:30,337
We're looking for someone to remind us

363
00:27:30,423 --> 00:27:32,776
that we're here
for more important reasons.

364
00:27:34,826 --> 00:27:35,977
What do you want from me?

365
00:27:36,013 --> 00:27:39,629
I want for you to find your purpose,
and to do that,

366
00:27:40,577 --> 00:27:42,325
your father has to go, John,

367
00:27:43,709 --> 00:27:45,595
and since you're not going to do it...

368
00:27:52,090 --> 00:27:53,741
I'm gonna suggest someone else.

369
00:27:59,266 --> 00:28:00,266
Sawyer?

370
00:28:01,390 --> 00:28:04,000
Why would Sawyer kill my father?
He doesn't even know him.

371
00:28:04,199 --> 00:28:05,199
Keep reading.

372
00:28:10,328 --> 00:28:11,594
Open this damn door!

373
00:28:12,447 --> 00:28:13,712
Son of a bitch!

374
00:28:23,524 --> 00:28:25,372
I'm pointin' my gun at you, John-boy.

375
00:28:25,825 --> 00:28:27,898
You got three seconds to open this door!

376
00:28:28,969 --> 00:28:30,958
You're not gonna shoot anyone, James.

377
00:28:32,074 --> 00:28:33,074
One...

378
00:28:35,074 --> 00:28:36,074
two!

379
00:28:36,386 --> 00:28:37,942
If there were any bullets in that gun,

380
00:28:38,014 --> 00:28:40,022
why would you hold a knife to my throat?

381
00:28:44,665 --> 00:28:45,977
Son of a bitch!

382
00:28:46,913 --> 00:28:48,753
Guess I didn't raise no dummies.

383
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:50,740
What the hell's that mean?

384
00:28:50,853 --> 00:28:54,487
It means that "bald-headed bastard"
outside the door is my son.

385
00:28:56,913 --> 00:28:57,927
Come again?

386
00:28:58,047 --> 00:28:59,091
My son.

387
00:28:59,884 --> 00:29:01,694
As in I'm his father.

388
00:29:01,997 --> 00:29:03,270
You do speak English?

389
00:29:09,627 --> 00:29:11,738
How did you get here... to the island?

390
00:29:12,438 --> 00:29:13,438
Island?

391
00:29:15,876 --> 00:29:18,876
I'm driving down I-10
through Tallahassee, when bam...

392
00:29:19,501 --> 00:29:21,518
Somebody slams into the back of my car.

393
00:29:23,938 --> 00:29:26,721
I go right into the divider
at 70 miles an hour.

394
00:29:26,815 --> 00:29:28,037
The next thing I know,

395
00:29:28,344 --> 00:29:30,230
the paramedics are strapping me
to a gurney,

396
00:29:30,251 --> 00:29:31,876
stuffing me in the back of an ambulance,

397
00:29:31,877 --> 00:29:34,213
and one of them actually smiles at me

398
00:29:34,315 --> 00:29:37,903
as he pops the I.V. In my arm,
and then... nothing.

399
00:29:38,817 --> 00:29:40,386
Just black.

400
00:29:42,436 --> 00:29:45,000
And the next thing I know,
I wake up in a dark room

401
00:29:45,063 --> 00:29:47,896
tied up, gag in my mouth,
and when the door opens,

402
00:29:48,126 --> 00:29:51,357
I'm looking up at the same man
I threw out a window...

403
00:29:51,688 --> 00:29:53,334
John Locke,

404
00:29:54,620 --> 00:29:56,224
my dead son.

405
00:30:06,529 --> 00:30:08,537
And he's dead 'cause you threw him
out a window?

406
00:30:08,625 --> 00:30:10,513
No, he survived that,

407
00:30:11,236 --> 00:30:13,752
but it paralyzed him, permanently.

408
00:30:15,186 --> 00:30:18,636
He's dead because the plane
he was flying on crashed in the Pacific.

409
00:30:22,704 --> 00:30:24,505
Well, I got bad news for you, pops,

410
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:26,855
'cause I was on that plane
with your son,

411
00:30:28,314 --> 00:30:30,003
and he sure as hell wasn't crippled.

412
00:30:30,537 --> 00:30:33,453
And we didn't crash in the pacific.
We crashed here on this island.

413
00:30:33,696 --> 00:30:35,211
You sure it's an island?

414
00:30:36,139 --> 00:30:37,361
Well, what else is it?

415
00:30:37,575 --> 00:30:39,663
Little hot for heaven, isn't it?

416
00:30:42,264 --> 00:30:44,933
Oh, okay, so we're dead.

417
00:30:45,264 --> 00:30:47,849
They found your plane
on the bottom of the ocean.

418
00:30:49,482 --> 00:30:51,581
One minute I'm in a car wreck,
and the next minute

419
00:30:51,639 --> 00:30:53,783
I'm in a pirate ship
in the middle of the jungle?

420
00:30:53,824 --> 00:30:55,489
If ts isn't hell, friend...

421
00:30:57,258 --> 00:30:58,346
Then where are we?

422
00:31:04,890 --> 00:31:06,662
Why did you throw Locke out a window?

423
00:31:06,852 --> 00:31:08,550
He was becoming a nuisance.

424
00:31:11,391 --> 00:31:13,798
I conned him into giving me
one of his kidneys.

425
00:31:14,139 --> 00:31:15,305
He never got over it.

426
00:31:17,951 --> 00:31:18,951
Conned?

427
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:20,640
Yes, sir.

428
00:31:21,388 --> 00:31:22,388
Conned.

429
00:31:29,512 --> 00:31:30,566
What's your name?

430
00:31:31,819 --> 00:31:32,819
Your name?

431
00:31:33,568 --> 00:31:35,885
A con man goes by many names, friend.

432
00:31:36,944 --> 00:31:38,263
I've been Alan Seward,

433
00:31:38,726 --> 00:31:42,432
Anthony Cooper, Ten McLaren, Tom Sawyer,

434
00:31:42,817 --> 00:31:45,200
- Louis Jackson, Paul...
- Tom Sawyer?

435
00:31:47,006 --> 00:31:49,181
I was young, and "Huck Finn"
was taken...

436
00:31:50,039 --> 00:31:52,094
And the ladies loved that one.

437
00:31:52,753 --> 00:31:53,881
Made me charming.

438
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:00,046
Well, how about that?

439
00:32:02,745 --> 00:32:03,878
How about what?

440
00:32:07,164 --> 00:32:08,923
Sawyer's my name, too.

441
00:32:31,446 --> 00:32:33,450
Ben, what's going on?

442
00:32:34,450 --> 00:32:37,009
- We're moving.
- Moving? Where are we going?

443
00:32:37,137 --> 00:32:38,859
We are not going anywhere, John.

444
00:32:39,452 --> 00:32:41,022
You are going to stay behind.

445
00:32:41,389 --> 00:32:43,222
You both are going to stay behind.

446
00:32:44,421 --> 00:32:46,251
What? You're not taking him?

447
00:32:46,517 --> 00:32:49,219
He's your mess, John.
Why would we clean him up?

448
00:32:49,237 --> 00:32:51,830
Ben, if you're trying to put me
in my place, or embarrass me...

449
00:32:51,930 --> 00:32:54,360
Where would you get
a ridiculous idea like that?

450
00:32:55,637 --> 00:32:57,025
Well, you can't leave me.

451
00:32:57,138 --> 00:33:00,450
- After everything, you can't just...
- Don't tell me what I can't do, John.

452
00:33:03,763 --> 00:33:05,830
But I thought I was... special.

453
00:33:09,013 --> 00:33:10,679
Well, everyone makes mistakes.

454
00:33:14,825 --> 00:33:15,825
We're leaving now.

455
00:33:16,951 --> 00:33:19,839
We'll leave a trail...
one you can track. And, John,

456
00:33:21,264 --> 00:33:24,085
unless you're carrying
your father's body on your back,

457
00:33:25,296 --> 00:33:26,365
don't bother.

458
00:33:59,676 --> 00:34:01,159
What's the matter with you?

459
00:34:03,013 --> 00:34:05,106
You ever been to Jasper, Alabama?

460
00:34:07,387 --> 00:34:08,387
Why?

461
00:34:09,138 --> 00:34:10,526
Have you, or haven't you?

462
00:34:12,512 --> 00:34:13,956
Yeah, I've been to Jasper.

463
00:34:15,222 --> 00:34:16,999
Don't tell me I'm your daddy.

464
00:34:18,634 --> 00:34:19,634
No.

465
00:34:21,757 --> 00:34:23,077
You killed my daddy.

466
00:34:44,633 --> 00:34:45,633
Read it.

467
00:34:53,072 --> 00:34:54,739
"Dear Mr. Sawyer... "

468
00:34:57,945 --> 00:34:59,774
- What is this?
- Just read it.

469
00:35:03,131 --> 00:35:07,188
"You don't know who I am,
but I know who you are,

470
00:35:08,572 --> 00:35:10,016
"and I know what you done.

471
00:35:11,319 --> 00:35:12,890
"You had sex with my mother

472
00:35:13,696 --> 00:35:16,912
"and then you stole
my dad's money all away,

473
00:35:17,445 --> 00:35:20,698
"so he got angry,
and he killed my mother... "

474
00:35:22,321 --> 00:35:24,247
"and then he killed himself... "

475
00:35:30,015 --> 00:35:31,141
So what?

476
00:35:31,969 --> 00:35:34,690
Is this supposed to be you?
You wrote this letter?

477
00:35:36,438 --> 00:35:37,627
Hey, wait a second.

478
00:35:38,549 --> 00:35:39,815
Did you take my name

479
00:35:39,882 --> 00:35:42,374
because you were on some kind
of revenge kick?

480
00:35:44,505 --> 00:35:46,500
- Keep reading.
- Easy, easy.

481
00:35:47,359 --> 00:35:48,879
Don't get all worked up.

482
00:35:49,754 --> 00:35:53,272
Look, I ran that con two dozen times.

483
00:35:54,253 --> 00:35:56,525
- If your mother was one of the...
- Mary.

484
00:35:58,942 --> 00:36:00,179
Her name was Mary.

485
00:36:03,941 --> 00:36:06,047
Mary from Jasper, Alabama.

486
00:36:07,628 --> 00:36:10,167
Yeah, I remember her.

487
00:36:11,381 --> 00:36:15,047
She practically begged me
to take her $38,000

488
00:36:15,254 --> 00:36:18,076
and to rescue her
from her sorry little life.

489
00:36:20,130 --> 00:36:21,352
You finish the letter.

490
00:36:21,815 --> 00:36:23,704
Look, I only took her money.

491
00:36:24,066 --> 00:36:26,420
It ain't my fault your dad overreacted.

492
00:36:26,755 --> 00:36:28,820
If he pulled the old murder-suicide,

493
00:36:28,941 --> 00:36:30,809
then I'm sure he's down here
somewhere.

494
00:36:30,942 --> 00:36:32,751
Maybe you could take this up with him.

495
00:36:32,816 --> 00:36:33,932
Finish it!

496
00:36:52,531 --> 00:36:53,892
You wanna go to hell?

497
00:36:54,825 --> 00:36:56,167
You wanna go to hell?!

498
00:37:46,003 --> 00:37:47,003
Thank you.

499
00:37:53,412 --> 00:37:55,072
You missing those cheeseburgers yet?

500
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:56,308
Only every second.

501
00:38:02,094 --> 00:38:03,254
I need to talk to you.

502
00:38:06,218 --> 00:38:08,287
- In private.
- No problem.

503
00:38:08,341 --> 00:38:10,751
Anything you wanna say to me,
you can say in front of her.

504
00:38:10,807 --> 00:38:11,845
Not this.

505
00:38:12,156 --> 00:38:14,690
- It's okay.
- No, no. You can stay.

506
00:38:17,131 --> 00:38:18,775
Yeah, you know what? You should stay.

507
00:38:19,604 --> 00:38:21,653
Seems only fair, considering
that she's the reason

508
00:38:21,654 --> 00:38:23,539
no one wants to tell you
that there's a woman

509
00:38:23,590 --> 00:38:26,458
in Hurley's tent who parachuted
onto the island yesterday.

510
00:38:26,904 --> 00:38:28,121
- What?
- A woman.

511
00:38:28,168 --> 00:38:30,142
She jumped from her chopper
before it crashed.

512
00:38:30,153 --> 00:38:32,005
She says that the boat
that she took off from

513
00:38:32,029 --> 00:38:34,546
is about 80 miles off the coast
and that if she can find a way

514
00:38:34,586 --> 00:38:36,163
to contact it, we'll all be rescued!

515
00:38:36,322 --> 00:38:37,632
Why didn't anyone tell me this?

516
00:38:39,878 --> 00:38:42,801
I already told you...
because they don't trust you.

517
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:52,280
How?

518
00:38:53,273 --> 00:38:54,278
How what?

519
00:38:54,279 --> 00:38:55,966
How is she supposed to contact her boat?

520
00:38:55,967 --> 00:38:57,377
Did you hear what I just said?

521
00:38:57,504 --> 00:39:00,430
Hurley, Charlie, Sayid, your friends,
are afraid to...

522
00:39:01,847 --> 00:39:02,907
How?

523
00:39:07,593 --> 00:39:10,504
She had a phone-radio thing.

524
00:39:10,907 --> 00:39:12,469
Sayid's trying to get it to work.

525
00:39:15,862 --> 00:39:16,978
We should tell her.

526
00:39:20,155 --> 00:39:22,064
- No.
- Tell me what?

527
00:39:22,261 --> 00:39:24,569
- We should tell her.
- Not yet.

528
00:39:50,093 --> 00:39:51,338
You can go back now.

529
00:39:53,798 --> 00:39:55,220
Why did you do this?

530
00:39:57,344 --> 00:39:58,738
He ruined my life,

531
00:39:59,385 --> 00:40:00,807
and he ruined yours.

532
00:40:04,904 --> 00:40:06,070
And he had it coming.

533
00:40:11,148 --> 00:40:12,415
Juliet is a mole.

534
00:40:13,223 --> 00:40:15,179
- What?
- She's working for Ben.

535
00:40:15,630 --> 00:40:18,398
He sent her back to find out
which of our women were pregnant.

536
00:40:18,453 --> 00:40:20,799
Three days from now,
there's gonna be a raid on the beach,

537
00:40:20,846 --> 00:40:22,047
and they're gonna take them.

538
00:40:22,157 --> 00:40:24,388
They say they don't want anyone
to get hurt.

539
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:27,675
Well, why are you telling me?

540
00:40:28,154 --> 00:40:30,741
- So you can warn the camp.
- You warn the camp.

541
00:40:32,656 --> 00:40:33,711
I'm not going back.

542
00:40:34,968 --> 00:40:36,397
You're going back undercover?

543
00:40:37,904 --> 00:40:39,792
No, I was never undercover, James.

544
00:40:41,234 --> 00:40:42,599
I'm on my own journey now.

545
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:48,054
Even if Juliet is a mole,
they ain't gonna believe me.

546
00:40:48,130 --> 00:40:50,128
I been saying that since she showed up.

547
00:40:52,843 --> 00:40:54,095
They'll believe you now.

548
00:41:02,593 --> 00:41:03,593
Is it true?

549
00:41:05,529 --> 00:41:06,529
Is what true?

550
00:41:07,092 --> 00:41:08,925
That he threw you out a window...

551
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:13,613
That you were a cripple?

552
00:41:17,529 --> 00:41:18,529
Not anymore.
