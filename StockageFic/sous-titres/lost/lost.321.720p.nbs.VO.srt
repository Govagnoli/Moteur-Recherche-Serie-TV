2
00:00:01,524 --> 00:00:03,147
Desmond said I was gonna die.

3
00:00:03,269 --> 00:00:05,924
He told me he has
these flashes... visions.

4
00:00:06,074 --> 00:00:09,161
When I saw the lightning hit the roof,
you were electrocuted.

5
00:00:09,283 --> 00:00:11,048
And when you heard
Claire was in the water,

6
00:00:11,078 --> 00:00:14,003
you drowned trying to save her.
I dove in myself, so you never went in.

7
00:00:14,125 --> 00:00:15,649
No matter what I try to do,

8
00:00:15,785 --> 00:00:17,202
you're gonna die, Charlie.

9
00:00:17,324 --> 00:00:18,678
There's a woman in Hurley's tent

10
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:20,668
who parachuted
onto the island yesterday.

11
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:23,758
She says that the boat she took off from
is about 80 miles off the coast,

12
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:26,850
and if she can find a way to contact it,
we'll all be rescued.

13
00:00:26,972 --> 00:00:28,278
Why didn't anyone tell me this?

14
00:00:28,482 --> 00:00:29,969
Because they don't trust you.

15
00:00:30,324 --> 00:00:31,409
<i>Kwon is pregnant.</i>

16
00:00:31,564 --> 00:00:32,564
Where'd you get that?

17
00:00:32,677 --> 00:00:35,011
You really think
you're in a position to ask questions?

18
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:37,053
I told Jack what they were making me do.

19
00:00:37,222 --> 00:00:38,499
Why didn't you tell us?

20
00:00:38,722 --> 00:00:41,099
Because I hadn't decided
what to do about it yet.

21
00:01:17,011 --> 00:01:18,423
Anyone wants to venture a guess

22
00:01:18,548 --> 00:01:21,386
as to what Jack's gonna be showing us
out in the middle of nowhere?

23
00:01:21,697 --> 00:01:23,177
I don't know. Stuff.

24
00:01:24,322 --> 00:01:25,544
Probably secret stuff.

25
00:01:26,503 --> 00:01:28,450
Why does everything
have to be such a secret?

26
00:01:28,572 --> 00:01:30,433
How about some openness
for a change?

27
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:33,142
We kept the parachute lady secret.

28
00:01:33,264 --> 00:01:34,430
Ah, that's different.

29
00:01:34,575 --> 00:01:35,575
Different how?

30
00:01:36,073 --> 00:01:38,866
Well, because we weren't out there
playing football with them.

31
00:01:39,264 --> 00:01:40,264
What?

32
00:01:41,597 --> 00:01:42,636
Nothing.

33
00:01:42,762 --> 00:01:43,762
Wait.

34
00:01:45,369 --> 00:01:47,311
You had one of your flashes
again, didn't you?

35
00:01:48,074 --> 00:01:49,296
No, Charlie, I didn't.

36
00:01:52,947 --> 00:01:53,947
We're here.

37
00:02:06,449 --> 00:02:07,746
A couple of nights ago,

38
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:10,747
Juliet came to me,
and she told me everything...

39
00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:15,057
That Ben had sent her here to find out
which of our women were pregnant.

40
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,921
So what, you guys
were doing tests on us?

41
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:19,366
No, but that's what he wanted me to do.

42
00:02:20,447 --> 00:02:23,449
I've been leaving tapes
at the medical station.

43
00:02:24,097 --> 00:02:25,448
You all heard what he said.

44
00:02:25,574 --> 00:02:26,907
They're coming tomorrow.

45
00:02:28,335 --> 00:02:31,061
Sun, I'm sorry that I lied to you.

46
00:02:32,262 --> 00:02:34,027
While I appreciate your honesty, Jack,

47
00:02:34,449 --> 00:02:36,634
it doesn't explain
why you brought us out here.

48
00:02:50,824 --> 00:02:51,824
Show 'em.

49
00:03:13,573 --> 00:03:15,599
When Juliet told me they where coming,

50
00:03:16,575 --> 00:03:18,160
the first thing I thought was,

51
00:03:18,988 --> 00:03:20,907
where the hell
are we gonna hide this time?

52
00:03:21,588 --> 00:03:22,917
But hiding's pointless.

53
00:03:23,135 --> 00:03:24,947
They're just gonna keep coming back.

54
00:03:25,948 --> 00:03:27,809
So I went out, and I found some help.

55
00:03:28,892 --> 00:03:29,939
And for the past few days,

56
00:03:30,061 --> 00:03:32,360
she's been bringing dynamite
back from "the black rock."

57
00:03:33,053 --> 00:03:34,089
For the very first time,

58
00:03:34,211 --> 00:03:37,356
we know exactly what they want,
when they're coming to get it,

59
00:03:37,509 --> 00:03:39,329
and they have no idea

60
00:03:40,467 --> 00:03:41,988
that we're gonna be waiting for 'em.

61
00:03:44,028 --> 00:03:46,459
So Juliet's gonna mark the tents
with the white rocks,

62
00:03:46,581 --> 00:03:47,773
just like she was told to,

63
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,603
but there's not gonna be
any pregnant women inside.

64
00:03:51,725 --> 00:03:53,941
There's gonna be plenty
of what we used on that tree.

65
00:03:55,202 --> 00:03:56,388
So tomorrow night...

66
00:03:57,778 --> 00:03:58,778
We stop hiding.

67
00:03:59,217 --> 00:04:00,262
We stop running.

68
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:03,495
We stop living in fear of them,
because when they show up...

69
00:04:06,777 --> 00:04:08,610
we're gonna blow 'em all to hell.

70
00:04:09,961 --> 00:04:21,932
Subtitles: swsub.com

71
00:04:27,858 --> 00:04:28,858
Bloody hell!

72
00:04:29,419 --> 00:04:30,922
Why are we even doing this?

73
00:04:31,044 --> 00:04:32,044
Chin up, mate.

74
00:04:32,325 --> 00:04:34,108
- We're headlining.
- Headlining?

75
00:04:34,591 --> 00:04:35,942
We're playing Clitheroe...

76
00:04:36,169 --> 00:04:37,423
The arse end of nowhere.

77
00:04:37,545 --> 00:04:38,545
A gig's a gig.

78
00:04:38,922 --> 00:04:40,156
We're building our fan base.

79
00:04:40,298 --> 00:04:42,734
Will our fan base pay
for a new sodding tire?

80
00:04:43,048 --> 00:04:44,286
Only if we show up.

81
00:04:45,203 --> 00:04:47,201
So let's just get on with it, shall we?

82
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:49,279
You know what, Liam?

83
00:04:49,441 --> 00:04:50,599
You get on with it.

84
00:04:50,795 --> 00:04:51,795
I quit.

85
00:04:52,233 --> 00:04:54,592
- You're giving up?
- There's nothing to give up on!

86
00:04:54,983 --> 00:04:57,980
We're broke! The album's not selling!
We're a bloody joke!

87
00:04:58,102 --> 00:04:59,169
Hey, shut it!

88
00:05:00,421 --> 00:05:01,421
Listen.

89
00:05:06,554 --> 00:05:07,655
That's us.

90
00:05:11,099 --> 00:05:12,257
We're on the radio!

91
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:16,988
That we are.

92
00:05:17,147 --> 00:05:18,900
We're on the bloody radio!

93
00:05:24,416 --> 00:05:25,827
I told you, baby brother!

94
00:05:25,949 --> 00:05:27,595
We're gonna be bloody rock stars.

95
00:05:34,946 --> 00:05:36,093
Can I ask you something?

96
00:05:39,649 --> 00:05:41,666
Who are you people
about to go to war with?

97
00:05:42,618 --> 00:05:43,966
Oh, that's a long story.

98
00:05:44,088 --> 00:05:45,574
Want to ask me something else?

99
00:05:46,357 --> 00:05:47,424
You having a laugh?

100
00:05:48,228 --> 00:05:49,335
Of course not.

101
00:05:49,642 --> 00:05:51,663
I'd never disrespect a fellow Mancunian.

102
00:05:52,618 --> 00:05:54,764
- You're from Manchester, then?
- I am.

103
00:05:54,964 --> 00:05:57,823
My band got its start at
the night and day bar on Oldham street.

104
00:05:58,391 --> 00:06:00,466
- What band?
- We were called Drive Shaft.

105
00:06:01,585 --> 00:06:02,862
Yeah. Yeah, I know you.

106
00:06:03,185 --> 00:06:04,986
We had our moment in the sun.

107
00:06:05,108 --> 00:06:06,516
No, not that... the crash.

108
00:06:06,897 --> 00:06:08,181
You're the dead rock star.

109
00:06:08,329 --> 00:06:10,713
They made a big deal out of you
when they found the plane.

110
00:06:11,021 --> 00:06:12,874
Huge memorial service, new album.

111
00:06:13,059 --> 00:06:14,061
There's a new album?

112
00:06:14,183 --> 00:06:15,954
Yeah. God, it was everywhere...

113
00:06:16,127 --> 00:06:17,466
A "greatest hits" thing.

114
00:06:23,277 --> 00:06:25,098
Hey, look on the bright side.

115
00:06:25,528 --> 00:06:27,083
You're not really dead, right?

116
00:06:28,964 --> 00:06:29,964
Yeah, right.

117
00:06:54,063 --> 00:06:55,231
We need more wire,

118
00:06:56,123 --> 00:06:58,209
so we can trigger these
from a safe distance.

119
00:06:58,331 --> 00:07:00,547
I can get people to start
stripping the plane wreckage.

120
00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:03,418
Good. I should be able
to finish rigging these tents

121
00:07:03,578 --> 00:07:04,827
in the next 24 hours.

122
00:07:05,343 --> 00:07:07,035
We'll be ready by tomorrow night.

123
00:07:12,995 --> 00:07:14,567
We need to talk about Naomi's phone.

124
00:07:14,689 --> 00:07:16,459
- Not now.
- If you're angry I doubted you,

125
00:07:16,581 --> 00:07:18,605
I'd be happy to make
a sincere apology later,

126
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:21,494
- but now we have a means...
- Look, I'm a little bit busy right now.

127
00:07:21,616 --> 00:07:23,977
And I am trying to get us
off this island!

128
00:07:27,973 --> 00:07:29,372
I can't transmit using this phone

129
00:07:29,494 --> 00:07:32,275
because Danielle's distress signal
is overriding the frequency.

130
00:07:33,582 --> 00:07:35,278
If you tell me where the radio tower is,

131
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,893
I can go there, switch off
your message and call for help.

132
00:07:38,029 --> 00:07:40,483
My signal has been playing
for the last 16 years,

133
00:07:40,605 --> 00:07:41,751
and nobody has heard it.

134
00:07:41,899 --> 00:07:43,654
Why do you think
you'll have better luck?

135
00:07:43,776 --> 00:07:47,101
Naomi's boat is only 80 miles offshore.

136
00:07:48,072 --> 00:07:50,483
I know if we eliminate
Danielle's signal, they'll hear us.

137
00:07:50,528 --> 00:07:51,590
No, they won't.

138
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,400
And why is that?

139
00:07:54,488 --> 00:07:55,532
We're jamming it.

140
00:07:55,958 --> 00:07:56,958
What?

141
00:07:57,036 --> 00:07:58,710
Ben is using one of the Dharma stations

142
00:07:58,735 --> 00:08:01,249
to block all of the signals off
of the island except for ours.

143
00:08:01,275 --> 00:08:02,275
What station?

144
00:08:02,651 --> 00:08:04,254
They call it the "Looking Glass."

145
00:08:05,052 --> 00:08:06,386
- The looking glass?
- Yes.

146
00:08:06,508 --> 00:08:08,663
But it's underwater.
I have no idea where it is.

147
00:08:11,025 --> 00:08:12,025
I believe I do.

148
00:08:14,214 --> 00:08:16,154
Look, I know...
I know Jack thinks it's best,

149
00:08:16,276 --> 00:08:18,770
but, you know, what if
they're coming for him again?

150
00:08:21,276 --> 00:08:22,442
Claire, listen to me.

151
00:08:23,275 --> 00:08:24,497
I'm gonna protect you.

152
00:08:25,027 --> 00:08:26,483
I'm gonna protect Aaron.

153
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:29,026
I promise.

154
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:31,915
Look, everything is gonna be fine.

155
00:08:36,998 --> 00:08:38,009
Sorry.

156
00:08:40,226 --> 00:08:41,845
Can you give me a hand with something?

157
00:08:44,353 --> 00:08:45,409
Of course.

158
00:08:58,388 --> 00:09:00,772
So you ready to tell me
what you saw this morning?

159
00:09:01,587 --> 00:09:02,587
Aye.

160
00:09:03,838 --> 00:09:06,131
Right. So how does it happen this time?

161
00:09:10,089 --> 00:09:11,089
Come on, Des!

162
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:13,164
You can tell me. I can take it.

163
00:09:18,328 --> 00:09:19,828
What I saw, Charlie, was...

164
00:09:21,451 --> 00:09:23,630
Claire and her baby
getting into a helicopter...

165
00:09:24,766 --> 00:09:25,877
A helicopter that...

166
00:09:27,578 --> 00:09:30,190
That lifts off, leaves this island.

167
00:09:36,451 --> 00:09:37,451
You sure?

168
00:09:38,017 --> 00:09:39,017
Aye.

169
00:09:39,517 --> 00:09:40,628
Rescue helicopter...

170
00:09:41,201 --> 00:09:42,201
On this beach?

171
00:09:42,515 --> 00:09:44,007
This island? That's what you saw?

172
00:09:46,451 --> 00:09:48,062
We're getting bloody rescued!

173
00:09:48,618 --> 00:09:50,991
I thought you were gonna tell me
I was gonna die again.

174
00:09:56,389 --> 00:09:57,389
You are, Charlie.

175
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:00,951
Wait. What?

176
00:10:02,581 --> 00:10:03,700
If you don't...

177
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:06,149
none of it will happen.

178
00:10:08,171 --> 00:10:09,615
There won't be any rescue.

179
00:10:13,107 --> 00:10:14,208
I'm sorry, brother...

180
00:10:15,466 --> 00:10:16,478
but this time...

181
00:10:19,597 --> 00:10:21,197
This time you have to die.

182
00:10:28,797 --> 00:10:29,853
Come on!

183
00:10:34,346 --> 00:10:36,492
Come on, Charlie. Jump in!

184
00:10:37,151 --> 00:10:38,484
I'm gonna catch you, boy.

185
00:10:39,587 --> 00:10:41,666
No. You're just going to back away.

186
00:10:41,872 --> 00:10:43,560
Don't be daft. Jump in!

187
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:48,707
I promise, Charlie. I'm gonna catch you.

188
00:10:48,997 --> 00:10:50,036
No, he won't!

189
00:10:50,748 --> 00:10:51,748
Zip it, you.

190
00:10:53,234 --> 00:10:54,959
Look, don't listen to your brother.

191
00:10:55,372 --> 00:10:56,434
Just jump on in.

192
00:10:59,434 --> 00:11:01,580
There's nothing to be afraid of,
Charlie.

193
00:11:03,123 --> 00:11:05,299
I'll catch you. I promise.

194
00:11:28,587 --> 00:11:29,683
I did it!

195
00:11:31,149 --> 00:11:32,208
You got it!

196
00:11:32,330 --> 00:11:34,901
- I did it.
- You're swimming, Charlie.

197
00:11:43,524 --> 00:11:44,603
What you writing?

198
00:11:52,557 --> 00:11:53,557
Nothing.

199
00:12:01,307 --> 00:12:02,362
All right, tell me.

200
00:12:05,494 --> 00:12:07,160
Are you sure you want to know?

201
00:12:09,273 --> 00:12:11,131
I mean, it might be easier
if you just...

202
00:12:12,782 --> 00:12:13,974
I want to know.

203
00:12:17,865 --> 00:12:19,091
You're inside a hatch.

204
00:12:19,423 --> 00:12:20,525
It's...

205
00:12:22,013 --> 00:12:23,401
a room full of equipment.

206
00:12:24,452 --> 00:12:26,016
There's a blinking yellow light

207
00:12:26,345 --> 00:12:27,721
above a switch.

208
00:12:28,415 --> 00:12:29,624
You flip the switch.

209
00:12:31,891 --> 00:12:32,891
Light goes off.

210
00:12:39,006 --> 00:12:40,130
And then you drown.

211
00:12:51,890 --> 00:12:52,890
When?

212
00:12:56,332 --> 00:12:57,451
I don't know.

213
00:12:57,825 --> 00:13:00,286
You're sure you saw Claire and Aaron
get on that helicopter?

214
00:13:00,576 --> 00:13:01,576
Aye.

215
00:13:04,328 --> 00:13:05,328
So...

216
00:13:07,575 --> 00:13:09,532
before I... drown...

217
00:13:11,626 --> 00:13:13,147
I just have to flip a switch?

218
00:13:15,292 --> 00:13:16,336
That's right.

219
00:13:21,015 --> 00:13:22,015
Where is it, then?

220
00:13:26,377 --> 00:13:28,056
Now this is the Looking Glass.

221
00:13:28,701 --> 00:13:30,275
It's an underwater Dharma station.

222
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:33,701
Please, can you tell me anything
you might know about this place?

223
00:13:33,896 --> 00:13:35,246
I've never been down there.

224
00:13:35,559 --> 00:13:37,012
I don't know anyone who has.

225
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:38,700
Why not?

226
00:13:39,283 --> 00:13:40,736
There was some accident.

227
00:13:41,249 --> 00:13:43,573
Ben told us that the station
was completely flooded.

228
00:13:43,706 --> 00:13:45,756
Well, if it's flooded,
then how does it still work?

229
00:13:45,898 --> 00:13:47,408
How it still works is irrelevant.

230
00:13:47,575 --> 00:13:49,855
The question is, how do
we get it to stop working,

231
00:13:50,015 --> 00:13:51,713
so we could use the satellite phone?

232
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:56,223
The diagram shows
that the looking glass

233
00:13:56,373 --> 00:13:58,236
is connected to the island by a cable.

234
00:13:59,014 --> 00:14:00,869
I feel sure that this is
the very same cable

235
00:14:01,014 --> 00:14:03,055
down the beach
which runs into the ocean.

236
00:14:03,504 --> 00:14:06,166
So if we follow the cable,
it should lead us to the station.

237
00:14:06,417 --> 00:14:07,973
So how are we gonna get in?

238
00:14:08,185 --> 00:14:09,274
We swim in.

239
00:14:09,563 --> 00:14:10,755
There's a moon pool...

240
00:14:11,972 --> 00:14:14,300
A room with an open floor
at the base of the station...

241
00:14:14,509 --> 00:14:16,439
Big enough
for a submarine to dock.

242
00:14:16,721 --> 00:14:18,288
Even if the station's flooded,

243
00:14:18,928 --> 00:14:21,414
I think I'll be able to find
the relay switch and disable it.

244
00:14:21,563 --> 00:14:23,149
What about swimming back out?

245
00:14:26,433 --> 00:14:28,524
No. I'm not letting you
go on some suicide mission

246
00:14:28,703 --> 00:14:29,900
just to flip the switch.

247
00:14:30,023 --> 00:14:32,351
Someone has to do it,
or we'll never leave this island.

248
00:14:32,529 --> 00:14:33,529
I'll do it.

249
00:14:33,681 --> 00:14:35,700
I can swim down, turn off that
bloody switch, swim back up.

250
00:14:35,759 --> 00:14:36,088
Piece of cake.

251
00:14:36,141 --> 00:14:38,343
Charlie, you don't even know
what we're talking about.

252
00:14:38,434 --> 00:14:40,614
I was junior swim champion
in northern England.

253
00:14:40,739 --> 00:14:42,140
I can hold my breath for 4 minutes.

254
00:14:42,208 --> 00:14:43,990
I know exactly what
you're talking about.

255
00:14:48,738 --> 00:14:50,861
No, and there's no reason
to do this now.

256
00:14:50,918 --> 00:14:53,461
We're gonna focus on the others,
and then we'll deal with this.

257
00:14:53,506 --> 00:14:55,863
Wait a minute.
We have a chance to signal for a rescue.

258
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:59,559
Look, for 90 days, I've been asked
to make decisions for this entire camp.

259
00:15:00,247 --> 00:15:01,904
There you go.
I just made one.

260
00:15:11,509 --> 00:15:13,076
Rose, that's a sailor's hitch.

261
00:15:13,643 --> 00:15:16,347
It's not gonna hold.
You wanna do a sheet bend like mine.

262
00:15:16,449 --> 00:15:18,084
Oh, so now you're a knot expert.

263
00:15:18,764 --> 00:15:20,099
Well, trust me, it's...

264
00:15:25,213 --> 00:15:26,314
How did you do that?

265
00:15:27,245 --> 00:15:28,653
Watch and learn, dear.

266
00:16:34,669 --> 00:16:36,118
Look there!
Look!

267
00:16:52,944 --> 00:16:54,313
Get off him, damn it!
It's okay.

268
00:16:54,358 --> 00:16:57,306
- What? He's one of them!
- I know! It's okay.

269
00:16:59,115 --> 00:17:00,511
He was in the cage next to me.

270
00:17:01,386 --> 00:17:02,578
I know this guy.

271
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:04,847
What the hell are you doing here, Karl?

272
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:07,146
They're... coming...

273
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:09,122
My people.

274
00:17:09,190 --> 00:17:11,747
Sorry you came all this way for nothing,
but we already know.

275
00:17:11,883 --> 00:17:13,112
Then why are you still here?

276
00:17:13,158 --> 00:17:16,068
'cause when they'll show up tomorrow
night, we're gonna be ready for 'em.

277
00:17:16,069 --> 00:17:19,120
Tomorrow? No, no,
they're coming tonight.

278
00:17:26,058 --> 00:17:27,518
They're coming right now!

279
00:17:29,685 --> 00:17:33,451
SIX HOURS AGO (del vo)

280
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:39,072
When did you get back?

281
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:40,355
Just now.

282
00:17:42,602 --> 00:17:43,602
Where's Locke?

283
00:17:46,623 --> 00:17:47,815
Here's your gun back.

284
00:17:53,217 --> 00:17:54,238
Ben, what's going on?

285
00:17:54,291 --> 00:17:55,291
Where's Ryan?

286
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:57,144
He's in his tent. Are you...

287
00:17:57,212 --> 00:17:58,540
It's time to get them.

288
00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:01,204
But you said tomorrow.

289
00:18:01,415 --> 00:18:03,026
Jacob wants it to happen now.

290
00:18:03,910 --> 00:18:05,198
Look, what happened out there?

291
00:18:05,228 --> 00:18:07,002
- Did john see...
- John had an accident.

292
00:18:09,853 --> 00:18:10,853
Ryan?

293
00:18:10,977 --> 00:18:11,977
Yes, sir?

294
00:18:12,384 --> 00:18:13,479
If you leave right now,

295
00:18:13,536 --> 00:18:15,455
how long will it take you
to reach their camp?

296
00:18:15,952 --> 00:18:18,778
Well, if I take my ten best,
we could set up to hit 'em by nightfall.

297
00:18:18,869 --> 00:18:20,945
- Then you better get going.
- No, Ben, wait.

298
00:18:21,115 --> 00:18:22,199
Moving up the schedule...

299
00:18:22,268 --> 00:18:24,481
Juliet may not be ready.
What if she hasn't had time...

300
00:18:24,538 --> 00:18:26,241
Then we'll take all their women...

301
00:18:27,968 --> 00:18:29,864
And we'll sort out
the ones we need later.

302
00:18:30,467 --> 00:18:31,523
And the men?

303
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:34,138
If any of 'em are stupid enough
to get in your way,

304
00:18:34,789 --> 00:18:35,789
kill 'em.

305
00:18:36,775 --> 00:18:37,785
All right.

306
00:18:50,186 --> 00:18:51,242
Karl!

307
00:18:53,790 --> 00:18:54,790
It's me!

308
00:18:58,093 --> 00:18:59,478
I thought you were bringing rabbit.

309
00:18:59,524 --> 00:19:01,567
You have to go... now.

310
00:19:01,976 --> 00:19:03,963
What? Did he find out I was out here?

311
00:19:04,167 --> 00:19:06,542
No, but he's sending Pryce
to their beach camp right now,

312
00:19:06,665 --> 00:19:07,761
and you have to warn them.

313
00:19:07,811 --> 00:19:09,192
- Warn them?
- You have to go now!

314
00:19:09,242 --> 00:19:11,455
I thought they were just gonna
take the pregnant women.

315
00:19:11,485 --> 00:19:12,511
If you take the outrigger,

316
00:19:12,533 --> 00:19:14,209
you'll get there
a few hours before them.

317
00:19:14,564 --> 00:19:16,916
- Wait, Alex...
- He's gonna kill them Karl!

318
00:19:20,852 --> 00:19:22,629
Austen and Ford saved your life.

319
00:19:26,541 --> 00:19:27,541
You owe them.

320
00:19:31,545 --> 00:19:32,703
You better take this.

321
00:19:35,865 --> 00:19:38,113
If I get caught, your father's
gonna kill me this time.

322
00:19:38,353 --> 00:19:39,392
Is he my father?

323
00:19:49,026 --> 00:19:50,168
Now go.

324
00:20:16,275 --> 00:20:17,478
Is that everything?

325
00:20:20,705 --> 00:20:21,801
Can we trust him?

326
00:20:22,121 --> 00:20:23,188
You don't trust me?

327
00:20:23,393 --> 00:20:24,393
What about her?

328
00:20:24,891 --> 00:20:25,976
She's a spy.

329
00:20:27,173 --> 00:20:30,341
She's supposed to mark the tents
of the pregnant women with white rocks

330
00:20:30,463 --> 00:20:32,968
- so they can take them.
- They know, Karl, but thanks.

331
00:20:34,907 --> 00:20:37,348
- So what are we gonna do?
- We have to leave now... Hide.

332
00:20:37,703 --> 00:20:40,523
Where? It's their island.
f they wanna kill us, they'll find us.

333
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,614
The sun's gonna go down in a few hours.

334
00:20:45,233 --> 00:20:47,390
- Do we have enough wire yet?
- Not even close.

335
00:20:47,855 --> 00:20:50,168
We have to find out another way
to set the dynamite off.

336
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:52,081
- We can shoot.
- We don't have enough guns.

337
00:20:52,203 --> 00:20:53,458
Ten of them are coming, armed.

338
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:55,011
Not the others... the tents.

339
00:20:55,133 --> 00:20:57,268
We can camouflage the dynamite
next to the tents,

340
00:20:57,398 --> 00:20:59,680
target it from our positions
at the tree line.

341
00:21:01,570 --> 00:21:04,366
Juliet marked three tents.
That means we need three guns.

342
00:21:05,886 --> 00:21:07,713
Here. You can have mine, too.

343
00:21:09,848 --> 00:21:10,926
I'll be your third.

344
00:21:12,751 --> 00:21:14,771
I'll take your gun,
but you're not staying here.

345
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:19,768
You're gonna lead everyone
to the radio tower... Everyone.

346
00:21:19,927 --> 00:21:20,951
The radio tower?

347
00:21:21,082 --> 00:21:23,232
If this doesn't work,
we can't risk losing the chance

348
00:21:23,354 --> 00:21:24,966
of getting in contact with Naomi's boat,

349
00:21:25,088 --> 00:21:27,227
so everything has to happen
at the same time.

350
00:21:32,492 --> 00:21:33,697
You still up for a swim?

351
00:21:37,053 --> 00:21:38,219
Yeah, I believe I am.

352
00:21:40,365 --> 00:21:41,365
I'll go with him.

353
00:21:42,552 --> 00:21:44,785
Okay, better get to it.

354
00:22:01,306 --> 00:22:02,646
It's here, baby brother.

355
00:22:02,951 --> 00:22:03,990
Christmas is here.

356
00:22:07,115 --> 00:22:08,977
Are these the birds from row two?

357
00:22:10,977 --> 00:22:12,158
Well done, mate.

358
00:22:18,038 --> 00:22:19,832
Well, as you have spent another year

359
00:22:20,249 --> 00:22:23,030
as the only drug-free
rock star in the world,

360
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:25,476
I'm gonna share
a little-known fact with you.

361
00:22:28,236 --> 00:22:31,517
Father christmas lives
just down the street from here.

362
00:22:31,698 --> 00:22:33,310
Father christmas lives in Helsinki?

363
00:22:33,454 --> 00:22:34,612
Indeed he does,

364
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:36,641
and in case you haven't noticed,
baby brother,

365
00:22:37,016 --> 00:22:39,048
Finland is the bloody north pole.

366
00:22:41,722 --> 00:22:45,559
Therefore, I have a very special
gift for you this year.

367
00:22:51,490 --> 00:22:53,617
Liam, no. Mum gave you that.

368
00:22:53,936 --> 00:22:55,060
You're the firstborn.

369
00:22:55,648 --> 00:22:58,343
It was her father's
and his father before that.

370
00:22:58,465 --> 00:23:00,784
And it's a family heirloom,
and at's why we named the band

371
00:23:00,925 --> 00:23:02,111
after Dexter bloody Stratton.

372
00:23:02,252 --> 00:23:03,303
I know.

373
00:23:03,471 --> 00:23:05,605
But, Charlie, let's be honest.

374
00:23:07,428 --> 00:23:09,205
We both know I'm a sodding mess.

375
00:23:09,739 --> 00:23:11,725
But you... You're different.

376
00:23:12,135 --> 00:23:14,334
You're gonna get married,
have a family...

377
00:23:15,302 --> 00:23:16,404
A baby.

378
00:23:17,802 --> 00:23:19,138
I'll be lucky if I hit 30.

379
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:20,384
Don't say that, Lee.

380
00:23:21,021 --> 00:23:23,530
The ring has to stay
in the family, Charlie.

381
00:23:25,054 --> 00:23:26,054
So, please...

382
00:23:27,615 --> 00:23:28,615
Take it.

383
00:23:29,991 --> 00:23:31,706
Mum would have wanted it this way.

384
00:23:32,303 --> 00:23:34,340
Pass it on to your little one someday.

385
00:23:35,042 --> 00:23:36,733
I need to know it's safe.

386
00:23:43,977 --> 00:23:45,215
I'll hold on to it...

387
00:23:48,502 --> 00:23:49,665
but I won't take it.

388
00:23:53,587 --> 00:23:55,427
Hey, it fits. Look at that.

389
00:23:57,852 --> 00:23:59,260
Happy christmas, baby brother.

390
00:24:31,054 --> 00:24:32,099
You need some help?

391
00:24:33,994 --> 00:24:36,128
Why didn't you tell me
you were gonna do this?

392
00:24:41,858 --> 00:24:43,232
I didn't want you to worry.

393
00:24:44,849 --> 00:24:46,370
Well, it's dangerous, isn't it,

394
00:24:46,514 --> 00:24:48,513
swimming into some underwater station?

395
00:24:49,212 --> 00:24:52,085
It's what needs to be done
to get us all rescued.

396
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:55,846
I'll be fine, Claire.

397
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:58,829
But you gotta promise me something.

398
00:25:00,599 --> 00:25:01,616
While I'm gone...

399
00:25:05,119 --> 00:25:06,379
Don't worry about me.

400
00:25:19,652 --> 00:25:20,697
I'll take him.

401
00:25:23,632 --> 00:25:24,632
Thanks.

402
00:25:31,345 --> 00:25:32,627
Alright, turnip head.

403
00:25:34,573 --> 00:25:36,304
Now you take care of your mum

404
00:25:37,313 --> 00:25:38,539
while I'm away, okay?

405
00:25:48,443 --> 00:25:49,443
I love you.

406
00:26:09,254 --> 00:26:10,287
See you soon.

407
00:26:14,267 --> 00:26:15,430
Be careful, Charlie.

408
00:26:16,732 --> 00:26:17,758
Okay?

409
00:27:09,341 --> 00:27:10,476
Sorry, guys.

410
00:27:10,833 --> 00:27:11,906
Thanks, man.

411
00:27:22,161 --> 00:27:24,432
Help! Help me!

412
00:27:28,063 --> 00:27:29,153
Please!

413
00:27:31,364 --> 00:27:32,374
You, stop!

414
00:27:33,123 --> 00:27:34,736
Get the hell away from her!

415
00:27:35,764 --> 00:27:36,767
What are you doing?

416
00:27:36,889 --> 00:27:37,889
Leave her alone!

417
00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:42,140
You okay, miss?

418
00:27:42,701 --> 00:27:44,686
Yes. I think so, yes.

419
00:27:47,077 --> 00:27:48,077
Here you go.

420
00:27:49,718 --> 00:27:51,266
Pardon me while I have a heart attack.

421
00:27:51,388 --> 00:27:53,622
The last time I was in a fight,
I was 8 years old.

422
00:27:56,770 --> 00:27:57,889
And I lost.

423
00:27:59,106 --> 00:28:02,512
Well, that makes you even more
of a hero, doesn't it?

424
00:28:03,388 --> 00:28:04,872
I just did what anyone would do.

425
00:28:05,583 --> 00:28:07,922
Three people walked by the alley.

426
00:28:08,951 --> 00:28:10,053
- What?
- They saw me,

427
00:28:10,803 --> 00:28:12,210
but they just kept on going.

428
00:28:14,889 --> 00:28:16,482
You are a hero, sir...

429
00:28:18,076 --> 00:28:21,135
And don't let anyone ever
tell you differently.

430
00:28:37,392 --> 00:28:39,224
- What's that?
- It's a weight belt.

431
00:28:39,766 --> 00:28:42,110
It should bring you down
quicker than swimming.

432
00:28:43,504 --> 00:28:45,026
Well, every second counts.

433
00:28:46,828 --> 00:28:48,830
So I just take it off when I hit bottom,

434
00:28:49,393 --> 00:28:51,106
swim up through the moon pool,

435
00:28:51,451 --> 00:28:52,644
into the station,

436
00:28:53,650 --> 00:28:57,408
swim into whichever room
has the yellow blinking switch,

437
00:28:58,907 --> 00:28:59,985
flip it.

438
00:29:02,361 --> 00:29:03,385
Nothing to it.

439
00:29:08,084 --> 00:29:11,179
So how long
can you really hold your breath for?

440
00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:14,390
Does it matter?

441
00:29:20,805 --> 00:29:23,576
- Do you want me to hit another one?
- No, you've made your point.

442
00:29:23,805 --> 00:29:26,868
Bernard, this is not pheasant hunting
in Montgomery county.

443
00:29:26,990 --> 00:29:28,623
- I know what I'm doing.
- No.

444
00:29:28,745 --> 00:29:31,698
- Pheasants don't shoot back.
- Nothing's gonna happen to me, Rose.

445
00:29:31,992 --> 00:29:35,250
I just have to shoot a tent,
and I'll be right behind you.

446
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:36,900
Then I'm staying, too.

447
00:29:37,755 --> 00:29:38,867
No, you're not, Rose.

448
00:29:41,013 --> 00:29:43,374
Everyone's gathering down
at the south end of the beach.

449
00:29:43,951 --> 00:29:45,636
No one's staying behind
but the shooters.

450
00:29:45,767 --> 00:29:47,889
Says who? You wanna give me your word

451
00:29:48,011 --> 00:29:50,919
that nothing's gonna happen
to my husband, then I'll go.

452
00:29:53,132 --> 00:29:55,243
I'll give you my word
that if we don't kill everyone

453
00:29:55,365 --> 00:29:57,126
who shows up here in about an hour,

454
00:29:57,437 --> 00:29:59,322
it's not gonna matter where Bernard is.

455
00:30:00,727 --> 00:30:02,941
I like you better
since you got back, Jack.

456
00:30:03,307 --> 00:30:04,840
You're almost an optimist.

457
00:30:05,726 --> 00:30:08,058
Come on.
If you're gonna be hiding in the bushes,

458
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:09,822
let's get you into somethin' dark.

459
00:30:13,866 --> 00:30:15,096
You better get going.

460
00:30:15,806 --> 00:30:18,265
Rousseau says it's about
a day's walk up to the radio tower.

461
00:30:18,387 --> 00:30:20,658
I'm not taking them to the tower.
You are.

462
00:30:22,842 --> 00:30:25,118
- Excuse me?
- You're not staying behind.

463
00:30:26,494 --> 00:30:27,642
This was my idea.

464
00:30:27,764 --> 00:30:29,504
And I'm perfectly capable
of executing it.

465
00:30:29,626 --> 00:30:31,947
- I owe them!
- What are you more concerned with,

466
00:30:32,612 --> 00:30:35,575
killing the others
or getting our people off this island?

467
00:30:38,245 --> 00:30:40,398
This afternoon,
you said you were our leader.

468
00:30:45,367 --> 00:30:46,998
It's time for you to act like one.

469
00:30:51,805 --> 00:30:53,860
Lead them to the radio tower, Jack...

470
00:30:56,041 --> 00:30:57,563
and then take us all home.

471
00:31:08,947 --> 00:31:10,491
Dudes, wait!

472
00:31:15,485 --> 00:31:17,730
I heard what you're doing.
I wanna come with.

473
00:31:21,003 --> 00:31:23,943
Everyone...
They're all going to the radio tower,

474
00:31:24,930 --> 00:31:28,520
and I'm sick of trekking and,
you know, explosions.

475
00:31:30,052 --> 00:31:31,732
I think I can help you guys out.

476
00:31:32,738 --> 00:31:34,180
I'm a really good paddler.

477
00:31:40,679 --> 00:31:41,845
You can't go, Hurley.

478
00:31:43,724 --> 00:31:44,806
Why not?

479
00:31:47,369 --> 00:31:48,369
Because...

480
00:31:50,963 --> 00:31:52,064
you're too big.

481
00:31:53,353 --> 00:31:54,794
You won't fit in the boat.

482
00:32:02,690 --> 00:32:03,859
That's uncool, man.

483
00:32:06,884 --> 00:32:08,019
Wait.

484
00:32:12,587 --> 00:32:15,255
Dude, it's fine. I don't even
wanna go on your stupid boat.

485
00:32:21,537 --> 00:32:22,911
I'll catch up with you later.

486
00:32:23,918 --> 00:32:25,121
Just remember I love you, man.

487
00:32:26,181 --> 00:32:27,646
Yeah, whatever. I love you, too.

488
00:32:42,819 --> 00:32:44,509
You got water in there? Good, good.

489
00:32:45,098 --> 00:32:46,461
How about you? Bottled water?

490
00:32:46,908 --> 00:32:47,930
Good.

491
00:32:52,487 --> 00:32:53,773
So here we go again, huh?

492
00:32:55,613 --> 00:32:56,664
Here we go again.

493
00:33:00,298 --> 00:33:02,047
The tents are all marked. We're set.

494
00:33:02,974 --> 00:33:04,466
Sayid find the third shooter?

495
00:33:16,005 --> 00:33:17,978
Ready, Claire?
Need a hand with the little guy?

496
00:33:18,502 --> 00:33:19,831
No, thanks. I'm okay.

497
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:29,107
How's my little sweetheart?

498
00:33:32,477 --> 00:33:35,368
We're just gonna go for a little walk,
so hold onto mum, okay?

499
00:33:59,639 --> 00:34:00,712
This is it!

500
00:34:08,785 --> 00:34:09,836
Ready?

501
00:35:25,251 --> 00:35:26,454
Do you want a blanket?

502
00:35:27,064 --> 00:35:28,382
Oh, thanks. I've got one.

503
00:35:29,694 --> 00:35:31,079
Well, you're warming for two.

504
00:35:31,474 --> 00:35:32,525
Take mine.

505
00:35:34,894 --> 00:35:35,938
Thank you.

506
00:35:44,674 --> 00:35:47,522
So... first plane crash?

507
00:35:48,949 --> 00:35:49,963
What gave it away?

508
00:35:50,563 --> 00:35:52,516
Ah, you can always spot the newbies.

509
00:35:57,744 --> 00:35:59,356
We're gonna be okay, you know.

510
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:02,462
Are we?

511
00:36:03,399 --> 00:36:04,399
We're alive.

512
00:36:05,188 --> 00:36:06,777
We're on a beautiful island.

513
00:36:07,912 --> 00:36:09,337
We'll sleep under the stars,

514
00:36:09,857 --> 00:36:12,732
and before you know it, the helicopters
will come and take us all home.

515
00:36:14,759 --> 00:36:16,246
You really think they'll find us?

516
00:36:17,632 --> 00:36:19,085
Well, yeah. Why wouldn't they?

517
00:36:22,103 --> 00:36:23,199
Thanks.

518
00:36:25,690 --> 00:36:26,735
I'm Charlie.

519
00:36:27,071 --> 00:36:28,160
I'm Claire.

520
00:36:28,797 --> 00:36:30,114
Nice to meet you, Charlie.

521
00:36:30,595 --> 00:36:31,787
It's nice to meet you.

522
00:36:53,491 --> 00:36:54,706
We're here.

523
00:37:05,645 --> 00:37:07,379
I want you to give this
to Claire for me.

524
00:37:14,084 --> 00:37:15,084
What is it?

525
00:37:20,331 --> 00:37:22,275
It's the five best moments of my...

526
00:37:24,096 --> 00:37:25,493
sorry excuse for a life.

527
00:37:29,003 --> 00:37:30,208
My greatest hits.

528
00:37:36,205 --> 00:37:37,205
You know...

529
00:37:40,833 --> 00:37:41,833
memories...

530
00:37:43,672 --> 00:37:44,768
are all I've got.

531
00:37:47,186 --> 00:37:48,368
You don't have to do this.

532
00:37:50,186 --> 00:37:51,196
What?

533
00:37:53,205 --> 00:37:54,205
I'll go.

534
00:37:55,402 --> 00:37:56,963
No, your... Your flashes...

535
00:37:57,175 --> 00:37:58,180
Maybe...

536
00:37:59,042 --> 00:38:01,061
I keep seeing you die because...

537
00:38:03,648 --> 00:38:05,306
I'm supposed to take your place.

538
00:38:11,186 --> 00:38:12,435
What about your girl...

539
00:38:13,287 --> 00:38:14,394
Penny?

540
00:38:16,621 --> 00:38:17,824
What about your girl?

541
00:38:22,537 --> 00:38:23,644
Besides...

542
00:38:28,028 --> 00:38:29,399
I might be luckier than you.

543
00:38:39,903 --> 00:38:41,390
Keep your memories to yourself.

544
00:38:45,446 --> 00:38:46,718
I'll take it from here.

545
00:38:54,821 --> 00:38:56,081
I don't know what to say.

546
00:38:59,684 --> 00:39:02,385
Well, you can tell me where the,
the weight belt is.

547
00:39:03,748 --> 00:39:05,008
Right there behind you.

548
00:39:31,342 --> 00:39:32,636
You and I both know...

549
00:39:33,918 --> 00:39:35,870
You aren't supposed
to take my place, brother.

550
00:41:40,663 --> 00:41:41,895
I'm alive.
