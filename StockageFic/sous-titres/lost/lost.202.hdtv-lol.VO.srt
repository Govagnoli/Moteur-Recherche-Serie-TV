1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,845
Previously on "Lost"...

2
00:00:03,669 --> 00:00:04,452
- Good luck.
- Same to you.

3
00:00:14,225 --> 00:00:16,358
- We have to fire the flare.
- It doesn't make--

4
00:00:16,545 --> 00:00:19,880
Look, are you gonna give me the damn gun,
or am I gonna have to take it?

5
00:00:22,604 --> 00:00:24,171
Please, god.

6
00:00:26,573 --> 00:00:27,470
It's coming back!

7
00:00:27,568 --> 00:00:28,800
It's coming back!

8
00:00:33,878 --> 00:00:35,924
We're gonna have
to take the boy.

9
00:00:36,024 --> 00:00:37,906
What? What'd you say?

10
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:41,104
The boy--
we're gonna have to take him.

11
00:00:44,990 --> 00:00:46,830
- Hey!
- Dad!

12
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:48,350
- No!
- Dad!

13
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:52,710
Dad! Help me!

14
00:00:53,713 --> 00:00:55,088
- Walt!
- Help me, dad!

15
00:01:03,691 --> 00:01:04,829
No, no, no.

16
00:01:04,925 --> 00:01:05,805
Stop it!

17
00:01:06,136 --> 00:01:07,608
Stop it! We can't!

18
00:01:15,695 --> 00:01:17,501
Locke found a...

19
00:01:18,353 --> 00:01:20,063
a hatch in the ground.

20
00:01:20,868 --> 00:01:22,244
Sun comes up in three hours,

21
00:01:22,346 --> 00:01:24,579
and we're all gonna be
here to see that happen.

22
00:01:24,821 --> 00:01:27,296
We're gonna stay here tonight, okay?
Together.

23
00:01:29,137 --> 00:01:32,043
- John, what are you doing?
- I'm going in.

24
00:01:32,147 --> 00:01:35,579
Locke's going into that thing
whether you like it or not.

25
00:01:35,687 --> 00:01:38,018
I'm going in the hatch.

26
00:01:38,121 --> 00:01:40,166
Live together,
die alone, right?

27
00:01:40,502 --> 00:01:41,446
Right.

28
00:01:49,579 --> 00:01:52,868
John!
I think there's something down here!

29
00:02:06,457 --> 00:02:09,650
Dad, please! Dad!

30
00:02:09,802 --> 00:02:15,432
Walt! Walt!

31
00:02:18,978 --> 00:02:19,876
Mike?!

32
00:02:23,591 --> 00:02:24,297
Sawyer!

33
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:55,548
Hang on, Mike!

34
00:02:57,711 --> 00:02:58,468
Hang on, Mike!

35
00:03:00,583 --> 00:03:01,481
Hang on!

36
00:03:06,043 --> 00:03:06,940
Mike!

37
00:03:09,386 --> 00:03:10,332
Aah!

38
00:03:15,973 --> 00:03:16,490
Mike.

39
00:03:19,735 --> 00:03:20,205
Mike?

40
00:03:21,803 --> 00:03:22,606
Mike!

41
00:03:34,738 --> 00:03:35,438
Kate!

42
00:03:37,789 --> 00:03:38,592
Kate!

43
00:03:39,514 --> 00:03:40,316
Kate!

44
00:04:48,227 --> 00:04:50,369
- Where's Walt?
- I don't know.

45
00:04:50,611 --> 00:04:52,512
- Where is he?
- I don't know.

46
00:04:53,365 --> 00:04:54,836
Where the hell is my son?!

47
00:04:56,138 --> 00:04:57,132
Walt!

48
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:04,999
How'd you hurt your leg?

49
00:05:06,832 --> 00:05:08,494
Got hit by a car.

50
00:05:08,690 --> 00:05:09,731
Ow.

51
00:05:10,115 --> 00:05:10,769
Yeah.

52
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:14,519
So this is the paperwork
your ex-wife sent over.

53
00:05:14,624 --> 00:05:16,096
She's not my ex-wife,
man, she's--

54
00:05:16,194 --> 00:05:19,437
she's just Walt's mother.

55
00:05:20,669 --> 00:05:25,104
She, uh-- Susan-- she just got a
job in Rome with her boyfriend.

56
00:05:25,167 --> 00:05:26,549
They wanna take Walt with 'em.

57
00:05:26,643 --> 00:05:29,119
Oh, don't worry. I'm gonna take
real good care of you, Mr. Dylan.

58
00:05:29,785 --> 00:05:31,260
Dawson.

59
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:34,394
Right. Sorry. Dawson.

60
00:05:35,108 --> 00:05:38,540
So this boyfriend--
this is this guy Brian Porter?

61
00:05:38,648 --> 00:05:40,022
Yeah. Why? What's it say?

62
00:05:40,074 --> 00:05:42,599
It seems that
Susan wants you to

63
00:05:43,218 --> 00:05:45,168
relinquish your rights

64
00:05:45,314 --> 00:05:48,746
as Walt's father so that Mr.
Porter can adopt him.

65
00:05:48,835 --> 00:05:50,594
She wants me to
sign my son away?

66
00:05:50,694 --> 00:05:53,653
It's the only way they can
proceed with the adoption, yeah.

67
00:05:53,941 --> 00:05:56,846
Listen, if you sign this document,
legally,

68
00:05:56,933 --> 00:05:59,426
he'll be no different than any
other kid you pass on the street.

69
00:05:59,791 --> 00:06:03,361
You'd be giving up your
paternal rights-- all of them.

70
00:06:04,067 --> 00:06:06,629
Yeah,
so then can I stop her from going?

71
00:06:06,768 --> 00:06:08,860
Ooh,
I guess we could file an injunction

72
00:06:08,951 --> 00:06:10,615
so she couldn't leave the city,
but--

73
00:06:10,706 --> 00:06:14,568
Yeah, that. I wanna do that.

74
00:06:14,846 --> 00:06:15,743
Right.

75
00:06:16,398 --> 00:06:19,589
Um, Mr. Dawson.

76
00:06:20,241 --> 00:06:23,148
The fact that you came
in through these doors--

77
00:06:23,239 --> 00:06:23,946
that tells me something.

78
00:06:24,038 --> 00:06:28,186
It tells me that I'm the
best that you can afford.

79
00:06:29,121 --> 00:06:31,069
If we go forward with this,

80
00:06:31,169 --> 00:06:33,684
it's gonna take money--
a lot of it,

81
00:06:33,868 --> 00:06:36,057
even at my rates.

82
00:06:38,019 --> 00:06:41,020
This is David and Goliath,
so I gotta ask you,

83
00:06:41,064 --> 00:06:43,589
are you sure you
wanna do this?

84
00:06:44,719 --> 00:06:47,328
They're not taking
my son away.

85
00:06:49,290 --> 00:06:50,235
Walt!

86
00:06:51,321 --> 00:06:52,360
Walt!

87
00:06:55,296 --> 00:06:56,194
Walt!

88
00:06:56,612 --> 00:06:58,277
Mike!
You should save your energy.

89
00:06:58,368 --> 00:06:59,694
They took my son.

90
00:06:59,770 --> 00:07:03,163
Yeah, I saw that-- onto a boat, which
means he's not in shoutin' distance.

91
00:07:03,245 --> 00:07:04,142
You don't know that.

92
00:07:04,218 --> 00:07:05,688
Well,
I got a pretty good sense.

93
00:07:05,787 --> 00:07:07,588
And even if he was,
there's nothing you can do.

94
00:07:07,633 --> 00:07:08,912
Look, if he can hear me,

95
00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:10,522
he knows that I'm alive,

96
00:07:10,622 --> 00:07:13,714
that I'm coming for him,
that I'm going to get him back!

97
00:07:14,084 --> 00:07:17,372
Right now all I've got is that
maybe my son can hear me.

98
00:07:17,463 --> 00:07:19,364
Does that make
any sense to you?

99
00:07:19,416 --> 00:07:20,259
Yeah.

100
00:07:26,761 --> 00:07:27,705
W alt!

101
00:07:29,668 --> 00:07:31,284
Walt!

102
00:07:47,983 --> 00:07:48,928
Kate?

103
00:09:13,182 --> 00:09:14,080
Kate!

104
00:09:15,153 --> 00:09:17,630
- John.
- Easy. Easy. Easy.

105
00:09:18,235 --> 00:09:19,324
Behind you.

106
00:09:23,679 --> 00:09:25,288
Are you him?

107
00:09:28,609 --> 00:09:29,936
Are you him?

108
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:36,023
Jin!

109
00:09:37,845 --> 00:09:38,696
Jin!

110
00:09:40,472 --> 00:09:41,467
J in!

111
00:09:42,495 --> 00:09:44,300
Thought we had to
save our energy.

112
00:09:46,542 --> 00:09:47,877
Yeah, well...

113
00:09:48,758 --> 00:09:50,230
Jin's still out
there in the water,

114
00:09:50,321 --> 00:09:53,192
so if it's okay by you,
I'm gonna keep shoutin' awhile.

115
00:09:55,609 --> 00:09:56,937
Jin!

116
00:09:57,215 --> 00:09:58,782
Feeling guilty?

117
00:09:59,247 --> 00:10:00,290
What?

118
00:10:01,624 --> 00:10:03,623
You made me fire that flare.

119
00:10:06,053 --> 00:10:07,715
I made you fire...

120
00:10:08,696 --> 00:10:10,312
What, this is my fault?!

121
00:10:10,637 --> 00:10:12,300
They took my son.

122
00:10:12,625 --> 00:10:16,586
They found us, took Walt,
because you made me fire the flare.

123
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,345
Well,
at least Walt is on a boat,

124
00:10:18,429 --> 00:10:20,809
probably wrapped in a
blanket with a cup of cocoa,

125
00:10:20,854 --> 00:10:23,091
- While we're on this piece--
- Get off my raft.

126
00:10:23,555 --> 00:10:24,262
What?

127
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:24,854
Get--

128
00:10:26,537 --> 00:10:28,543
What the hell is that?

129
00:10:50,333 --> 00:10:53,955
I see you managed to hold
onto your best friend there.

130
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:56,040
Thing ain't gonna work anyway.

131
00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:57,939
- It'll work.
- You were underwater.

132
00:10:58,076 --> 00:11:00,606
What do you know about guns anyway,
hoss?

133
00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:02,107
It'll work.

134
00:11:07,501 --> 00:11:10,536
If the bullets are dry,
the powder's dry. If the powder's dry...

135
00:11:17,052 --> 00:11:19,322
Oh, my--
what the hell is that?

136
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:20,974
It's a shark.

137
00:11:25,179 --> 00:11:26,938
It's only a shark.

138
00:11:27,525 --> 00:11:29,044
"It's only a shark"?

139
00:11:29,137 --> 00:11:30,655
That's supposed to
make me feel better?

140
00:11:31,215 --> 00:11:33,643
Well, I guess I know why the
shark is hanging around--

141
00:11:33,781 --> 00:11:34,994
your shoulder.

142
00:11:35,366 --> 00:11:37,891
Oh, well,
I'll just stop bleedin', then.

143
00:11:39,478 --> 00:11:41,668
You suddenly forget
what happened,

144
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:43,800
why I got shot?

145
00:11:43,930 --> 00:11:44,730
What?

146
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:46,770
I mean,
how abouta little gratitude here?

147
00:11:47,669 --> 00:11:50,568
I mean, how about a thank you?

148
00:11:50,673 --> 00:11:52,513
A thank you? For what?

149
00:11:52,885 --> 00:11:55,122
For you trying to
save your own ass?

150
00:11:58,848 --> 00:12:00,650
You want me off this raft?

151
00:12:01,863 --> 00:12:03,333
You got it.

152
00:12:38,037 --> 00:12:40,967
I was trying to
save your damn kid.

153
00:12:44,053 --> 00:12:47,490
Let's talk about Walt, shall we, Mr.
Dawson?

154
00:12:48,137 --> 00:12:50,279
Uh, sure. Okay.

155
00:12:50,838 --> 00:12:53,280
When was the last time
you actually saw your son?

156
00:12:53,556 --> 00:12:55,990
Um, about a year ago.

157
00:12:56,156 --> 00:12:58,107
It was 14 months, actually.

158
00:12:58,211 --> 00:12:59,527
Is that a question, Lizzy?

159
00:12:59,573 --> 00:13:01,427
Why is that, Mr. Dawson?

160
00:13:01,705 --> 00:13:04,039
Why so long?

161
00:13:04,274 --> 00:13:06,938
Susan took him to Amsterdam,
for work.

162
00:13:07,321 --> 00:13:09,164
And you didn't have
a problem with that?

163
00:13:09,302 --> 00:13:10,202
Excuse me?

164
00:13:10,293 --> 00:13:13,009
Well, since she's now going to Rome,
and you're filing an injunction.

165
00:13:13,883 --> 00:13:15,886
Just seems a little
inconsistent to me.

166
00:13:16,065 --> 00:13:17,394
Incon-- no.

167
00:13:17,632 --> 00:13:19,623
- No, don't. Don't do--
- No, no, no.

168
00:13:19,676 --> 00:13:20,528
She's baiting you.
Don't answer.

169
00:13:20,612 --> 00:13:21,750
She took him, though.

170
00:13:21,823 --> 00:13:23,362
- I didn't want her to go.
- Michael, please don't talk.

171
00:13:23,435 --> 00:13:24,715
You said there was
nothing I could do.

172
00:13:24,809 --> 00:13:26,063
And you didn't do anything,
did you?

173
00:13:26,133 --> 00:13:27,510
He's not gonna answer
that question.

174
00:13:27,603 --> 00:13:29,121
That's because
there is no answer.

175
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:33,103
You were in an accident recently,
hmm?

176
00:13:35,066 --> 00:13:35,886
Yeah.

177
00:13:36,384 --> 00:13:37,902
You had several surgeries,

178
00:13:38,415 --> 00:13:41,705
spent weeks in a private hospital room,
extensive rehabilitation.

179
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:45,718
Who paid for all of that, Mr.
Dawson?

180
00:13:46,003 --> 00:13:47,583
I didn't ask you for anything.

181
00:13:47,675 --> 00:13:49,836
Could the record reflect that Mr.
Dawson acknowledged

182
00:13:49,926 --> 00:13:51,304
that Miss Lloyd
paid his bills?

183
00:13:51,378 --> 00:13:54,859
Susan, tell them that I
didn't ask you for anything.

184
00:13:54,950 --> 00:13:56,383
Please don't address
my client directly.

185
00:13:58,198 --> 00:14:00,974
Do you know what Walt's
first words were, Mr. Dawson?

186
00:14:01,105 --> 00:14:03,107
- I'm sorry. What?
- His first words.

187
00:14:03,890 --> 00:14:05,745
Do you know what they were?

188
00:14:06,398 --> 00:14:08,760
I... no.

189
00:14:09,773 --> 00:14:11,546
I wasn't there.

190
00:14:11,871 --> 00:14:13,679
Do you know what his
favorite food is?

191
00:14:16,483 --> 00:14:17,718
- Do you--
- No.

192
00:14:17,809 --> 00:14:19,473
Okay, this is unnecessary.

193
00:14:19,845 --> 00:14:20,600
No.

194
00:14:22,010 --> 00:14:25,959
Well, for someone who wants to
retain his paternal rights so badly,

195
00:14:26,050 --> 00:14:28,712
you don't seem to know much
about your son, Mr. Dawson.

196
00:14:30,616 --> 00:14:32,586
I'm his father.

197
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,542
I'm sorry. Could you say that louder,
please, just for the record?

198
00:14:37,082 --> 00:14:38,650
I'm his father.

199
00:14:52,312 --> 00:14:53,831
Hey, are you crazy?

200
00:14:54,913 --> 00:14:57,641
You  gonna take a bullet
out with your bare hands?

201
00:14:58,226 --> 00:15:00,005
You got a better idea?

202
00:15:00,965 --> 00:15:02,533
Then go to hell.

203
00:15:07,585 --> 00:15:09,728
You're never gonna be able
to do it by yourself.

204
00:15:10,004 --> 00:15:11,976
I thought we parted ways,
Mike.

205
00:15:12,048 --> 00:15:13,904
We're caught in
the same current.

206
00:15:14,602 --> 00:15:16,122
You still talking?

207
00:15:19,396 --> 00:15:20,345
Come on.

208
00:15:58,511 --> 00:16:00,160
You got a band-aid?

209
00:16:09,373 --> 00:16:10,194
Are you?

210
00:16:11,013 --> 00:16:12,258
Are you him?

211
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:18,525
Yes.

212
00:16:22,450 --> 00:16:24,114
Yes, I am.

213
00:16:30,008 --> 00:16:33,107
I can't believe it.
You're finally here.

214
00:16:34,190 --> 00:16:35,508
Well...

215
00:16:36,770 --> 00:16:38,404
here I am.

216
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:45,243
Who's she?

217
00:16:51,826 --> 00:16:53,306
She's with me.

218
00:16:57,414 --> 00:17:00,894
What did one snowman say
to the other snowman?

219
00:17:07,022 --> 00:17:08,972
I don't know what
you're talking about.

220
00:17:09,405 --> 00:17:11,152
Get rid of the knife.

221
00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:13,096
You're not him!

222
00:17:21,229 --> 00:17:22,885
We didn't come
here to hurt you.

223
00:17:22,970 --> 00:17:24,182
Yeah?

224
00:17:24,340 --> 00:17:25,430
Then why did you come?

225
00:17:25,476 --> 00:17:27,091
We were in a plane crash.

226
00:17:28,007 --> 00:17:29,491
Were you now?

227
00:17:30,013 --> 00:17:31,320
And when was that?

228
00:17:31,692 --> 00:17:33,786
44 days ago.

229
00:17:34,532 --> 00:17:36,032
44 days?

230
00:17:45,438 --> 00:17:46,412
Move.

231
00:18:00,151 --> 00:18:02,150
- How long have you been down here?
- Shut it.

232
00:18:11,429 --> 00:18:12,456
Tie him up.

233
00:18:14,092 --> 00:18:15,151
Do it!

234
00:18:16,304 --> 00:18:18,601
Wait, wait, wait.
You're tying up the wrong person.

235
00:18:19,770 --> 00:18:20,408
How's that, brother?

236
00:18:21,154 --> 00:18:23,671
It's pointless to tie me up.
I'm not dangerous.

237
00:18:23,759 --> 00:18:25,996
But her, she's a fugitive.

238
00:18:32,968 --> 00:18:34,650
So what does that make you then,
brother?

239
00:18:34,775 --> 00:18:39,117
I'm a regional collections manager
for a cardboard manufacturer.

240
00:18:39,186 --> 00:18:41,264
Boxes, primarily.

241
00:18:43,139 --> 00:18:45,053
All right, then,
box man, tie her up.

242
00:18:47,295 --> 00:18:48,768
- Don't you think about touch--
- Hey!

243
00:18:49,705 --> 00:18:51,368
You be a good girl, right?

244
00:18:54,665 --> 00:18:55,934
What do you think
you're doing?

245
00:18:56,048 --> 00:18:57,790
Doing what's best
for all of us.

246
00:19:02,996 --> 00:19:04,446
Right, bring her here.

247
00:19:06,016 --> 00:19:09,257
John. Hey. Wait! Hey!

248
00:19:09,325 --> 00:19:10,257
Shut it.

249
00:19:10,817 --> 00:19:11,384
Wait!

250
00:19:12,277 --> 00:19:13,602
You're kidding, right?

251
00:19:14,373 --> 00:19:15,612
You're going back?

252
00:19:16,384 --> 00:19:17,185
Yeah.

253
00:19:17,327 --> 00:19:18,799
What about all that
stuff you said about

254
00:19:19,034 --> 00:19:21,558
waiting till morning and
watching the sunrise?

255
00:19:22,606 --> 00:19:24,400
I changed my mind.

256
00:19:29,984 --> 00:19:31,741
What do you suppose
all that's about?

257
00:19:32,445 --> 00:19:34,999
I reckon Jack's gonna
do something heroic.

258
00:19:36,594 --> 00:19:37,351
What?

259
00:19:38,194 --> 00:19:42,171
You always try to be funny when you
don't want to answer a question.

260
00:19:42,563 --> 00:19:44,663
- "Try to be funny"?
- Hmm.

261
00:19:47,973 --> 00:19:49,638
What's this?

262
00:19:54,358 --> 00:19:57,349
Oh. Found it in the jungle.

263
00:19:57,895 --> 00:19:59,661
- You found it?
- Yeah.

264
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,623
Be careful.
Be careful with it.

265
00:20:02,717 --> 00:20:05,000
Here. Here. Take Aaron.

266
00:20:06,035 --> 00:20:07,841
Come here. There you go.

267
00:20:08,285 --> 00:20:11,312
You gotta be careful there.
You know, it's the Virgin Mary.

268
00:20:11,526 --> 00:20:12,949
She's holy.

269
00:20:13,029 --> 00:20:15,163
Didn't realize you
were so religious.

270
00:20:16,644 --> 00:20:21,928
I'm not. It's just, you know,
it might come in handy.

271
00:20:22,513 --> 00:20:25,113
Be a nice thing
to have around.

272
00:20:27,994 --> 00:20:28,679
Yeah.

273
00:20:36,494 --> 00:20:38,052
It wasn't the flare.

274
00:20:41,571 --> 00:20:43,806
I said, it wasn't the flare.

275
00:20:45,921 --> 00:20:49,209
Those people that did this--

276
00:20:50,223 --> 00:20:54,894
at first, I thought they were
fishermen or pirates or something.

277
00:20:55,458 --> 00:20:57,786
Then I got a good
look at their boat.

278
00:20:58,294 --> 00:21:00,677
You know anything about boats,
Mike?

279
00:21:02,223 --> 00:21:05,208
Boat like that wasn't
built for the open ocean.

280
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:07,842
Water's comin' over the side,
first little squall.

281
00:21:08,162 --> 00:21:10,086
Maybe got a range
of a hundred miles.

282
00:21:12,081 --> 00:21:15,802
A boat like that had to have
left port from somewhere close,

283
00:21:17,165 --> 00:21:18,663
like the island.

284
00:21:20,468 --> 00:21:24,176
French chick said the others
were coming for the kid.

285
00:21:25,044 --> 00:21:27,059
I think they came, Mike.

286
00:21:28,583 --> 00:21:29,577
What?

287
00:21:29,791 --> 00:21:31,254
He's the one they wanted,

288
00:21:31,336 --> 00:21:33,311
why I got a bullet
in my shoulder.

289
00:21:33,384 --> 00:21:36,858
Hell, Bluebeard blew us up
because they wanted your kid.

290
00:21:36,912 --> 00:21:40,056
- You saying this is my fault?
- Yeah. That's what I'm sayin'.

291
00:21:40,136 --> 00:21:41,754
They took my son
because of you.

292
00:21:41,826 --> 00:21:43,289
- Me?
- They were sailing away!

293
00:21:43,371 --> 00:21:46,321
They found us because they
were looking for us, for Walt!

294
00:21:46,391 --> 00:21:48,623
Don't you ever say his name again,
ever!

295
00:21:48,659 --> 00:21:50,945
What you gonna do, splash me?

296
00:22:33,963 --> 00:22:37,635
- Look, I know how--
- Shut up.

297
00:22:39,478 --> 00:22:40,961
Don't even.

298
00:22:41,878 --> 00:22:47,149
You have no idea what it's like
to care for somebody else.

299
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:00,669
Hi.

300
00:23:04,575 --> 00:23:06,080
Where  are your lawyers?

301
00:23:06,409 --> 00:23:11,345
I told them I wanted to talk,
just you and me.

302
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:13,844
But if you want yours,
I understand.

303
00:23:13,936 --> 00:23:16,179
No. That's okay.

304
00:23:23,657 --> 00:23:25,219
I think you're gonna win.

305
00:23:29,045 --> 00:23:30,680
Excuse me?

306
00:23:30,896 --> 00:23:34,169
In court. I think you're gonna keep me
from leaving the country with Walt.

307
00:23:35,850 --> 00:23:40,011
But I just...
have to ask you why.

308
00:23:41,037 --> 00:23:42,175
Why what?

309
00:23:42,269 --> 00:23:44,004
Why are you doing this?

310
00:23:44,777 --> 00:23:46,018
He's my son.

311
00:23:46,107 --> 00:23:47,774
Since when, Michael?

312
00:23:47,927 --> 00:23:50,915
Look, I know you don't care
about what's best for me, but

313
00:23:51,075 --> 00:23:53,296
in Rome,
I'll be a senior partner at the firm.

314
00:23:53,392 --> 00:23:55,868
I'll be able to give
Walt anything he needs.

315
00:23:55,964 --> 00:23:58,804
You're still on disability, Michael.
You can't work.

316
00:23:59,548 --> 00:24:01,816
You're about to be evicted
from your apartment.

317
00:24:01,909 --> 00:24:03,593
You got your lawyers
checking up on me now?

318
00:24:03,678 --> 00:24:04,709
Well, of course I did,

319
00:24:04,787 --> 00:24:06,832
just like you had your
lawyers checking up on me.

320
00:24:06,977 --> 00:24:09,168
- Nobody's winning here.
- Then stop.

321
00:24:12,079 --> 00:24:16,950
Michael, the first thing you need
to do is take care of yourself.

322
00:24:18,448 --> 00:24:20,284
You need to get healthy.

323
00:24:20,369 --> 00:24:22,158
You need to get back on
your feet financially

324
00:24:22,254 --> 00:24:24,976
so that you can get back
to pursuing your art.

325
00:24:26,097 --> 00:24:28,965
You have rare talent as an artist,
Michael.

326
00:24:29,053 --> 00:24:32,285
But how are you gonna do that,
any of that,

327
00:24:32,375 --> 00:24:34,869
and still be a part
of Walt's life?

328
00:24:36,915 --> 00:24:38,524
I'll do it by doing it.

329
00:24:39,958 --> 00:24:42,004
Walt is my responsibility,
too.

330
00:24:43,272 --> 00:24:45,204
Then let him go.

331
00:24:47,389 --> 00:24:49,858
Because it's not
about you or me.

332
00:24:49,953 --> 00:24:52,584
It's about him.

333
00:25:04,156 --> 00:25:06,344
I don't wanna go to court,
Michael.

334
00:25:07,941 --> 00:25:09,732
So please just...

335
00:25:12,331 --> 00:25:13,529
let him go.

336
00:28:21,072 --> 00:28:23,884
The pilot said we had lost
radio contact, but by then,

337
00:28:23,978 --> 00:28:26,921
we were already a thousand
miles off course.

338
00:28:27,001 --> 00:28:29,713
Any search teams would
have given up weeks ago.

339
00:28:29,802 --> 00:28:32,259
So you were traveling from
Sydney to Los Angeles?

340
00:28:32,692 --> 00:28:33,630
Yes.

341
00:28:34,701 --> 00:28:36,700
So they're all
still out there?

342
00:28:37,199 --> 00:28:39,172
Yeah, as far as I know.

343
00:28:41,121 --> 00:28:43,223
Could you tell me your name?

344
00:28:46,686 --> 00:28:47,824
My name?

345
00:28:51,199 --> 00:28:52,770
My name is Desmond.

346
00:28:54,032 --> 00:28:55,966
Desmond, I'm John.

347
00:28:57,157 --> 00:29:00,097
You should know,
the gun is really unnecessary.

348
00:29:00,194 --> 00:29:01,330
Oh, yeah?

349
00:29:01,753 --> 00:29:04,211
So I should just hand it
over to you then, should I?

350
00:29:08,013 --> 00:29:09,628
How many of you are there?

351
00:29:10,237 --> 00:29:14,565
Uh, 43,
but 4 sailed out this morning on a raft.

352
00:29:14,658 --> 00:29:15,725
A raft?

353
00:29:17,409 --> 00:29:20,429
That simulated sunlight--
is that because you never leave?

354
00:29:21,464 --> 00:29:23,640
Is there another way out?

355
00:29:24,341 --> 00:29:27,008
How many of your group
have gotten sick?

356
00:29:27,199 --> 00:29:28,322
Sick?

357
00:29:29,102 --> 00:29:31,641
Sick-- as in ill, as in dead.

358
00:29:31,736 --> 00:29:33,835
Is that why it says "quarantine"
on the inside of the hatch?

359
00:29:33,999 --> 00:29:35,352
Answer the question.

360
00:29:35,508 --> 00:29:39,066
No one has. No one.
No one's sick.

361
00:29:53,562 --> 00:29:54,460
Get up.

362
00:30:00,323 --> 00:30:01,253
Move.

363
00:30:02,533 --> 00:30:03,782
Stand right there.

364
00:30:07,558 --> 00:30:09,472
Do you know how to use this,
box man?

365
00:30:10,409 --> 00:30:12,006
I haven't seen one of
those in 20 years.

366
00:30:12,102 --> 00:30:14,865
- Do you know how to use it?!
- Yes. Sit.

367
00:30:17,738 --> 00:30:19,337
Right, now listen carefully.

368
00:30:19,438 --> 00:30:22,775
Type in exactly what I tell you,
understand? Exactly. Nothing else.

369
00:30:23,810 --> 00:30:28,581
4. 8. 15.

370
00:30:31,682 --> 00:30:32,999
Did you hear that?

371
00:30:33,527 --> 00:30:34,526
What?

372
00:30:36,194 --> 00:30:37,762
What did you just put in?

373
00:30:38,013 --> 00:30:39,716
What number did
you just put in?!

374
00:30:39,758 --> 00:30:41,898
- 15.
- Right. 16.

375
00:30:42,459 --> 00:30:47,548
23. 42. Now press "execute."

376
00:30:57,113 --> 00:30:59,618
Uh... what's gonna happen?

377
00:30:59,714 --> 00:31:01,337
Just push it!

378
00:31:14,096 --> 00:31:15,041
Kate!

379
00:31:16,025 --> 00:31:17,023
Locke!

380
00:31:17,209 --> 00:31:18,642
Who the hell is that?

381
00:31:19,419 --> 00:31:20,953
That would be Jack.

382
00:31:38,752 --> 00:31:40,205
Who is he?

383
00:31:40,504 --> 00:31:43,032
His name is Jack.

384
00:31:43,110 --> 00:31:44,601
He's our doctor.

385
00:31:44,695 --> 00:31:46,074
What's he doing here?

386
00:31:46,587 --> 00:31:49,143
Well, to be honest with you,
I'm a little surprised to see him.

387
00:31:53,381 --> 00:31:56,051
Your doctor has a gun,
brother.

388
00:31:57,908 --> 00:31:59,095
Move.

389
00:32:12,149 --> 00:32:14,101
Make one sound and I'll shoot.

390
00:32:14,711 --> 00:32:15,710
Move.

391
00:32:28,038 --> 00:32:29,051
Jack!

392
00:32:29,689 --> 00:32:30,635
Jack!

393
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:33,254
Jack!

394
00:32:35,413 --> 00:32:36,922
I wouldn't do that, Jack.

395
00:32:39,503 --> 00:32:40,354
Where's Kate?

396
00:32:40,448 --> 00:32:41,600
What the hell did you--

397
00:32:41,694 --> 00:32:42,705
Move...

398
00:32:43,050 --> 00:32:44,018
and I kill him.

399
00:32:45,155 --> 00:32:47,249
- Put the gun down.
- Where's Kate?

400
00:32:47,335 --> 00:32:48,925
- Jack, it's okay.
- I said drop it!

401
00:32:49,016 --> 00:32:50,779
- Where's Kate?!
- She's fine.Just put down--

402
00:32:50,868 --> 00:32:52,356
I'm not putting down anything.

403
00:32:54,255 --> 00:32:57,460
Do you want him to die?
Put it down.

404
00:32:58,543 --> 00:33:00,733
Is this what you were talking about,
Locke?

405
00:33:00,754 --> 00:33:02,529
Is this your destiny?

406
00:33:03,230 --> 00:33:04,737
"All roads lead here."

407
00:33:04,809 --> 00:33:05,967
Calm down.

408
00:33:07,009 --> 00:33:08,285
Lower your gun,

409
00:33:08,365 --> 00:33:10,905
or I'll blow his darned head off,
brother!

410
00:33:22,294 --> 00:33:23,558
You.

411
00:33:52,492 --> 00:33:53,928
What the hell is that?

412
00:33:56,908 --> 00:33:59,137
Part of the raft--
one of the pontoons.

413
00:34:00,691 --> 00:34:02,120
Stop paddling.

414
00:34:03,538 --> 00:34:04,937
Hey, stop it!

415
00:34:05,036 --> 00:34:08,084
You're putting a strain on the vines.
It's going to break us up.

416
00:34:10,332 --> 00:34:11,947
Damn it, you're gonna--

417
00:34:13,671 --> 00:34:14,888
Sawyer!

418
00:34:18,269 --> 00:34:19,413
Climb up.

419
00:34:19,498 --> 00:34:21,009
I do, and we both sink.

420
00:34:24,125 --> 00:34:25,661
I'm going for the pontoon.

421
00:34:30,737 --> 00:34:32,282
Don't be an idiot.

422
00:34:34,587 --> 00:34:36,481
You see that toothy
son of a bitch,

423
00:34:36,571 --> 00:34:38,197
you aim and squeeze. Got it?

424
00:34:38,343 --> 00:34:39,223
Got it.

425
00:34:56,762 --> 00:34:58,641
Come on, come on, come on.

426
00:35:24,412 --> 00:35:25,410
Sawyer?

427
00:35:30,879 --> 00:35:31,902
Sawyer!

428
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:36,650
Sawyer!

429
00:35:43,112 --> 00:35:44,248
Give me your hand.

430
00:36:10,552 --> 00:36:12,411
There he is. Do you see him?

431
00:36:13,744 --> 00:36:15,073
- Hi.
- Oh!

432
00:36:17,384 --> 00:36:18,248
Hey.

433
00:36:19,048 --> 00:36:21,392
Hey, I'm sorry I'm late.
Packing's been a disaster,

434
00:36:21,486 --> 00:36:23,113
and the plane leaves first
thing in the morning.

435
00:36:23,193 --> 00:36:24,046
Sure.

436
00:36:25,504 --> 00:36:26,948
No problem.

437
00:36:31,594 --> 00:36:34,603
Uh, hey,
do you want to say hi, Walt?

438
00:36:35,902 --> 00:36:38,393
Hi, Walt. I'm...

439
00:36:40,073 --> 00:36:41,018
I'm...

440
00:36:44,113 --> 00:36:47,848
Hey, uh, this is for you, man.

441
00:36:48,015 --> 00:36:49,169
He like bears?

442
00:36:49,433 --> 00:36:52,657
Yes. Uh, sure.
He's just really shy.

443
00:36:56,237 --> 00:36:57,415
Hey, little man.

444
00:36:57,866 --> 00:37:03,970
Oh, I guess I can't call you that.
I mean, 'cause look how big you are.

445
00:37:04,992 --> 00:37:06,082
So...

446
00:37:06,341 --> 00:37:10,965
you and I, we're not gonna see
each other for awhile, Walt.

447
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:17,311
Uh,
but you are gonna have a great life.

448
00:37:18,322 --> 00:37:22,880
I know your mommy--
she's gonna take real good care of you,

449
00:37:24,223 --> 00:37:25,800
and Brian is...

450
00:37:26,725 --> 00:37:28,613
gonna take good care of you,
too.

451
00:37:29,654 --> 00:37:31,070
But you know what?

452
00:37:32,057 --> 00:37:37,881
I just want you to know that
no matter where you go, I...

453
00:37:40,729 --> 00:37:42,605
that your daddy...

454
00:37:44,123 --> 00:37:49,992
yeah, your daddy--
he loves you very, very much.

455
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:53,724
And I always will.

456
00:37:55,141 --> 00:37:56,228
Always.

457
00:37:56,667 --> 00:37:57,356
Okay?

458
00:38:03,826 --> 00:38:04,934
I'm sorry. He's...

459
00:38:05,025 --> 00:38:06,012
No.

460
00:38:06,747 --> 00:38:07,678
It's okay.

461
00:38:10,158 --> 00:38:11,408
It's okay.

462
00:38:13,220 --> 00:38:14,380
Uh...

463
00:38:15,845 --> 00:38:17,815
Hey, here. Uh...

464
00:38:18,575 --> 00:38:20,158
Just, you know...

465
00:38:22,353 --> 00:38:25,116
You know, let him know it's
from me sometime, okay?

466
00:38:26,937 --> 00:38:28,389
Okay.

467
00:38:33,830 --> 00:38:35,543
Good-bye, Michael.

468
00:38:40,121 --> 00:38:41,817
Yeah. Bye.

469
00:39:28,399 --> 00:39:29,591
It's... uh...

470
00:39:30,801 --> 00:39:32,382
You all right, Mike?

471
00:39:37,989 --> 00:39:39,359
It was my fault.

472
00:39:41,578 --> 00:39:42,636
What?

473
00:39:44,110 --> 00:39:46,812
I never should have
brought him on the raft.

474
00:39:55,553 --> 00:39:57,384
I'm gonna get him back.

475
00:40:03,116 --> 00:40:05,411
I'm gonna get back my son.

476
00:40:20,581 --> 00:40:21,889
Well, how about that?

477
00:40:24,976 --> 00:40:26,441
Current brought us back.

478
00:40:30,395 --> 00:40:31,632
We're home.

479
00:40:54,981 --> 00:40:55,788
Jin?

480
00:40:59,892 --> 00:41:01,649
- Michael! Sawyer!
- Jin!

481
00:41:06,204 --> 00:41:07,293
Oh, oh, oh!

482
00:41:09,011 --> 00:41:09,960
Jin, what's wrong?

483
00:41:15,555 --> 00:41:16,878
Others. Others. Others.

484
00:41:17,534 --> 00:41:18,080
What?

485
00:41:18,172 --> 00:41:19,309
Others! Others!

486
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:19,968
What?

487
00:41:20,104 --> 00:41:21,048
