00:00:00,455 --> 00:00:01,828
<i>Previously on</i> Lost...

2
00:00:01,887 --> 00:00:04,376
I was in a wheelchair,
paralyzed for four years.

3
00:00:04,447 --> 00:00:06,079
This island, it changed me.

4
00:00:06,126 --> 00:00:07,229
It made me whole.

5
00:00:07,323 --> 00:00:09,413
I'm so thankful for you, John.

6
00:00:09,742 --> 00:00:11,327
You stole my kidney.

7
00:00:11,462 --> 00:00:13,622
You needed a father
and I needed a kidney,

8
00:00:13,826 --> 00:00:15,214
and that's what happened.

9
00:00:15,476 --> 00:00:16,476
Get over it.

10
00:00:16,527 --> 00:00:17,984
I don't care what Jack said.

11
00:00:18,053 --> 00:00:20,497
They've got him, and we have
to get him back. I owe him that.

12
00:00:20,521 --> 00:00:21,871
How did you get onto this island?

13
00:00:21,883 --> 00:00:23,491
They brought me on the submarine.

14
00:00:23,492 --> 00:00:26,669
So your people-- they can just come
and go whenever they want?

15
00:00:26,794 --> 00:00:29,447
You never know
when a little c4 might come in handy.

16
00:00:40,694 --> 00:00:41,716
Name?

17
00:00:42,557 --> 00:00:43,557
John Locke.

18
00:00:44,785 --> 00:00:46,153
Marital status, Mr. Locke?

19
00:00:47,494 --> 00:00:48,527
Single.

20
00:00:49,066 --> 00:00:50,076
Girlfriend?

21
00:00:54,423 --> 00:00:55,756
Are your parents living?

22
00:00:57,228 --> 00:01:00,453
I was raised in foster care.
I never really knew my parents.

23
00:01:02,490 --> 00:01:05,511
Have you ever considered
seeking out your biological parents?

24
00:01:08,532 --> 00:01:10,013
I don't see how that's relevant.

25
00:01:10,068 --> 00:01:12,353
It's relevant, Mr. Locke,
because if the government's

26
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,816
gonna continue paying
your disability insurance,

27
00:01:15,038 --> 00:01:17,910
I have to figure out whether or not
your condition has improved.

28
00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:22,967
So... How's your appetite?

29
00:01:25,033 --> 00:01:26,066
Fine.

30
00:01:27,707 --> 00:01:30,560
I see you stopped submitting
your therapy bills for reimbursement.

31
00:01:30,897 --> 00:01:32,452
It's 'cause I stopped going.

32
00:01:33,998 --> 00:01:34,998
Waste of time.

33
00:01:40,808 --> 00:01:43,252
It's just a temporary suspension,
Mr. Locke.

34
00:01:43,312 --> 00:01:46,256
As soon as you resume your sessions,
you can reapply.

35
00:01:46,602 --> 00:01:48,358
You think I'm temporarily disabled?

36
00:01:48,464 --> 00:01:50,297
Depression can be temporary, yes.

37
00:01:50,924 --> 00:01:54,173
And since you see fit to stop going
to therapy, I guess you're all better.

38
00:01:58,871 --> 00:01:59,948
Guess I am.

39
00:02:03,353 --> 00:02:04,374
Next!

40
00:02:15,539 --> 00:02:16,725
Over here!

41
00:02:23,705 --> 00:02:24,705
What is he doing?

42
00:02:29,009 --> 00:02:30,009
Good hands!

43
00:02:37,697 --> 00:02:38,742
Nice.

44
00:02:40,878 --> 00:02:43,320
She's the one who helped
me and Sawyer escape.

45
00:02:44,368 --> 00:02:45,436
What's up?

46
00:02:45,504 --> 00:02:46,843
I think it's gonna be a while...

47
00:02:56,057 --> 00:02:57,084
Hey, what?

48
00:03:01,381 --> 00:03:02,718
John, Rousseau's gone.

49
00:03:47,716 --> 00:03:50,493
This is gonna be more complicated
than we thought.

50
00:03:53,767 --> 00:04:00,054
Subtitles: swsub.com

51
00:04:00,084 --> 00:04:02,855
So you saying, we simply start
shooting people and hope for the best?

52
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:05,096
We came here to rescue Jack,
and we're gonna do it.

53
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,020
But obviously
the circumstances have changed.

54
00:04:07,021 --> 00:04:09,129
- He may not want to be rescued.
- That is not him.

55
00:04:09,152 --> 00:04:10,185
That's not Jack.

56
00:04:10,522 --> 00:04:13,672
They must have done someûthing to him.
When they captured us, they drugged us.

57
00:04:13,719 --> 00:04:16,823
- He didn't appear to be drugged.
- They kidnapped him, held him prisoner.

58
00:04:16,824 --> 00:04:18,559
- He wouldn't just forget that.
- I agree,

59
00:04:18,582 --> 00:04:20,944
but until we know why,
we're putting our lives at risk.

60
00:04:20,956 --> 00:04:22,085
I'm not leaving him, Sayid.

61
00:04:22,086 --> 00:04:23,991
- We may not have a choice.
- It's Jack.

62
00:04:26,538 --> 00:04:29,194
The first time I saw him,
he was risking his life

63
00:04:29,288 --> 00:04:31,680
pulling people out
of burning airplane wreckage.

64
00:04:32,498 --> 00:04:35,366
If he's shaking hands with the others,
I'm sure he has a good reason.

65
00:04:35,809 --> 00:04:38,809
We just have to go down there
and find out what it is.

66
00:04:42,862 --> 00:04:43,973
What do you suggest?

67
00:04:44,069 --> 00:04:46,814
We wait till it's dark.
We approach Jack when he's alone...

68
00:04:49,175 --> 00:04:51,020
And if he wants out, we get him out.

69
00:04:53,329 --> 00:04:54,582
<i>Here's what we know, Crystal.</i>

70
00:04:54,583 --> 00:04:58,749
<i>The bolivian coal deposits
were stolen last night around 2:00 a.m.</i>

71
00:04:59,186 --> 00:05:01,810
<i>Oh, that means the cobra...
he's back.</i>

72
00:05:04,836 --> 00:05:06,116
<i>Has he been shot?</i>

73
00:05:06,352 --> 00:05:07,352
<i>I can't find him!</i>

74
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:12,204
<i>He's armed! I can't get up!</i>

75
00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:17,002
Hello. John Locke?

76
00:05:18,052 --> 00:05:19,357
I'm sorry. No solicitors.

77
00:05:20,552 --> 00:05:23,135
- I have a sign.
- I'm not trying to sell you...

78
00:05:24,171 --> 00:05:25,971
Listen, my name's Peter Talbot.

79
00:05:26,279 --> 00:05:28,232
I just need
a couple minutes to talk to you.

80
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:29,333
Talk about what?

81
00:05:29,628 --> 00:05:31,522
My mother, actually.

82
00:05:32,482 --> 00:05:34,102
I think she might be in some trouble.

83
00:05:34,244 --> 00:05:35,714
You got the wrong John Locke.

84
00:05:35,799 --> 00:05:37,410
How many kidneys do you have?

85
00:05:42,516 --> 00:05:43,982
She met him two months ago.

86
00:05:44,074 --> 00:05:46,296
"Love at first sight," is what she said.

87
00:05:46,528 --> 00:05:49,132
The guy was charming, sweet, funny.

88
00:05:50,184 --> 00:05:51,461
His name's Adam Seward.

89
00:05:51,833 --> 00:05:54,602
He's a retired computer entrepreneur
from Ontario.

90
00:05:57,525 --> 00:06:00,613
Anyway, Adam had something... special.

91
00:06:00,944 --> 00:06:03,668
My mom just went gaga for him
right out of the gate.

92
00:06:03,881 --> 00:06:06,985
After two months of knowing him,
she agree to marry the guy.

93
00:06:07,132 --> 00:06:08,798
And something about him...

94
00:06:09,988 --> 00:06:12,286
Something in my gut told me
that he was after something,

95
00:06:12,383 --> 00:06:14,226
so I had to check him out.

96
00:06:16,292 --> 00:06:18,896
Well, I'm not sure I know
what any of this has to do with me.

97
00:06:18,897 --> 00:06:21,560
Well, what this has to do
with you, Mr. Locke,

98
00:06:22,606 --> 00:06:25,661
is that you donated
one of your kidneys to Adam Seward,

99
00:06:26,356 --> 00:06:28,467
only his name was different back then.

100
00:06:29,638 --> 00:06:31,485
He used to be "Anthony Cooper."

101
00:06:37,772 --> 00:06:39,994
All I could find
were his medical records,

102
00:06:41,275 --> 00:06:45,746
and I saw that he was the recipient
of a kidney transplant from... You.

103
00:06:47,133 --> 00:06:48,199
So I figured, hey,

104
00:06:48,841 --> 00:06:51,099
someone gave the guy his kidney.
How bad could he be?

105
00:06:52,893 --> 00:06:53,893
Right?

106
00:07:00,246 --> 00:07:03,592
Well, it-- it was an anonymous donation.

107
00:07:03,659 --> 00:07:04,659
I never met him.

108
00:07:10,425 --> 00:07:11,425
Are you sure?

109
00:07:11,643 --> 00:07:13,526
Yeah, I'm sorry. I can't help you.

110
00:07:58,658 --> 00:08:00,196
Sayid, you guard the front.

111
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,645
I'll go around and cover the back.

112
00:08:01,777 --> 00:08:04,197
- You head in through the side door.
- I'm going in alone?

113
00:08:04,294 --> 00:08:06,690
It's better
if you're the first one he sees.

114
00:08:06,851 --> 00:08:07,861
All right.

115
00:09:32,321 --> 00:09:33,612
What are you doing here?

116
00:09:34,745 --> 00:09:35,911
I came to get you.

117
00:09:36,365 --> 00:09:37,366
Get out of here

118
00:09:37,502 --> 00:09:38,664
right now. Go.

119
00:09:39,653 --> 00:09:40,986
Kate, they're watching me!

120
00:09:42,273 --> 00:09:43,941
- Get out of here!
- I'm not leaving you.

121
00:09:43,964 --> 00:09:45,495
- Yes, you are!
- Get down!

122
00:09:45,507 --> 00:09:47,052
Don't hurt her!

123
00:09:47,099 --> 00:09:48,268
Step back, doc.

124
00:09:48,523 --> 00:09:49,657
Step back.

125
00:09:53,626 --> 00:09:54,626
Hold him still.

126
00:09:57,581 --> 00:09:58,747
Who else is with you?

127
00:10:05,185 --> 00:10:06,907
Just answer the question, Kate.

128
00:10:08,462 --> 00:10:09,758
Okay, one more time--

129
00:10:12,168 --> 00:10:13,566
who else is with you?

130
00:10:18,604 --> 00:10:19,604
Nobody.

131
00:10:20,533 --> 00:10:22,106
Nobody else. It was just us.

132
00:10:58,119 --> 00:10:59,285
Keep your voice down.

133
00:11:00,418 --> 00:11:01,418
All right.

134
00:11:03,422 --> 00:11:04,588
It's all right, John.

135
00:11:04,726 --> 00:11:06,527
You don't have to point the gun at me.

136
00:11:06,528 --> 00:11:08,139
I can tell you where Jack is.

137
00:11:09,361 --> 00:11:10,700
I'm not looking for Jack.

138
00:11:14,048 --> 00:11:15,868
I'm looking for the submarine.

139
00:11:19,576 --> 00:11:20,651
The submarine...

140
00:11:21,399 --> 00:11:22,399
where is it?

141
00:11:22,757 --> 00:11:24,507
I'm not sure what you mean, John.

142
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:26,077
What submarine?

143
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:28,844
The one you use
to travel to and from the island...

144
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:32,024
The one your man Mikhail told me about

145
00:11:32,651 --> 00:11:33,913
right before I killed him.

146
00:11:35,398 --> 00:11:37,371
Dad? Who are you talking to?

147
00:11:37,444 --> 00:11:38,760
Alex, don't come in here!

148
00:11:43,909 --> 00:11:44,945
Tell her to be quiet.

149
00:11:44,946 --> 00:11:46,057
Alex, please.

150
00:11:46,798 --> 00:11:47,909
Ben, you awake?

151
00:11:54,914 --> 00:11:55,914
I'm coming in.

152
00:11:58,571 --> 00:11:59,571
What is it?

153
00:11:59,958 --> 00:12:01,442
It's Austen and Jarrah.

154
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,095
They're here. Somehow they found us.

155
00:12:05,277 --> 00:12:06,369
Where are they now?

156
00:12:06,427 --> 00:12:08,976
We captured them.
We're holding 'em over at my place.

157
00:12:08,977 --> 00:12:10,168
Want me to help you get out--

158
00:12:10,215 --> 00:12:12,583
Separate them.
I want to know how they found us.

159
00:12:12,691 --> 00:12:14,487
What about Juliet and Shepard?

160
00:12:14,516 --> 00:12:16,583
- Tomorrow--
- Let me worry about that. Just go.

161
00:12:16,584 --> 00:12:17,584
Got it.

162
00:12:18,335 --> 00:12:19,612
Richard, wait a minute.

163
00:12:19,638 --> 00:12:20,638
I'll wait outside.

164
00:12:27,045 --> 00:12:29,051
I want you to bring me
the man from Tallahassee.

165
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:33,799
- What do you need him for?
- Just do it. Now.

166
00:12:44,682 --> 00:12:47,031
"The man from Tallahassee"?
What is that...

167
00:12:47,287 --> 00:12:48,287
Some kind of code?

168
00:12:48,385 --> 00:12:50,645
No, John, unfortunately,
we don't have a code

169
00:12:50,688 --> 00:12:53,796
for "there's a man in my closet
with a gun to my daughter's head,"

170
00:12:54,041 --> 00:12:55,715
although we obviously should.

171
00:12:58,449 --> 00:12:59,999
He had a pack with him.

172
00:13:01,502 --> 00:13:02,946
I want her to retrieve it.

173
00:13:04,856 --> 00:13:05,856
Okay.

174
00:13:06,459 --> 00:13:09,009
But you should know, John,
my daughter currently hates me,

175
00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:11,515
so I'm not sure holding me hostage
is your best option--

176
00:13:11,516 --> 00:13:12,516
Dad!

177
00:13:14,270 --> 00:13:15,270
I'll get your bag.

178
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:27,213
No, nothing particular.

179
00:13:27,339 --> 00:13:29,641
I'm looking for something
really stunning,

180
00:13:29,690 --> 00:13:32,294
something that would grab
everyone's attention on the table.

181
00:13:32,749 --> 00:13:33,752
Honey?

182
00:13:35,178 --> 00:13:36,680
What do you think of this one?

183
00:13:37,418 --> 00:13:39,144
Oh, it looks good. What do you think?

184
00:13:39,405 --> 00:13:41,609
I like it. Maybe just a little larger.

185
00:13:47,917 --> 00:13:49,083
Larger would be good.

186
00:13:50,364 --> 00:13:51,832
I'll go over there and take a look.

187
00:13:58,783 --> 00:13:59,783
Hello, John.

188
00:14:00,518 --> 00:14:03,889
Gonna be a big to-do or just
the two of you and a preacher?

189
00:14:04,894 --> 00:14:07,569
I guess you couldn't invite me, huh?
That would make for...

190
00:14:08,351 --> 00:14:09,573
awkward introductions.

191
00:14:09,649 --> 00:14:10,891
How did you even know that I...

192
00:14:10,938 --> 00:14:15,353
I know because her son came to me
and asked why I gave you a kidney.

193
00:14:16,809 --> 00:14:19,263
He's on to you,
but he doesn't have any proof.

194
00:14:19,264 --> 00:14:21,819
So he came to me
hoping I would vouch for you.

195
00:14:22,966 --> 00:14:24,299
What did you say to him?

196
00:14:27,128 --> 00:14:28,850
You're conning her, aren't you?

197
00:14:30,231 --> 00:14:32,675
You're gonna marry her
for her money, right?

198
00:14:33,684 --> 00:14:35,193
What is it you want, John?

199
00:14:35,439 --> 00:14:36,605
I want you to end it.

200
00:14:37,842 --> 00:14:39,786
I want you to call off the wedding.

201
00:14:41,344 --> 00:14:42,621
Why are you doing this?

202
00:14:42,751 --> 00:14:45,013
Because it's not fair.

203
00:14:45,698 --> 00:14:48,363
You make people think
that you're their family,

204
00:14:49,028 --> 00:14:50,894
and then you leave their life in ruins,

205
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:53,359
and I'm not gonna let you do it again.

206
00:14:54,806 --> 00:14:57,306
You're gonna call off your engagement
and go,

207
00:14:58,371 --> 00:15:00,082
or I'm gonna tell her the truth.

208
00:15:02,922 --> 00:15:04,407
I want to hear you say it.

209
00:15:05,428 --> 00:15:06,928
You say you're gonna leave.

210
00:15:14,293 --> 00:15:15,293
Okay, John.

211
00:15:16,647 --> 00:15:17,647
You got it.

212
00:15:33,071 --> 00:15:35,326
Would you mind helping me
get into my chair?

213
00:15:38,024 --> 00:15:39,265
No tricks, I promise.

214
00:15:42,431 --> 00:15:43,819
I just want some dignity.

215
00:15:46,845 --> 00:15:50,434
You of all people should understand
what it means to want some dignity.

216
00:15:58,530 --> 00:15:59,598
Thank you.

217
00:16:04,023 --> 00:16:05,304
So tell me, John,

218
00:16:05,950 --> 00:16:07,833
how do you expect to pilot
our submarine?

219
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:10,443
I mean, it's a complicated
piece of machinery.

220
00:16:11,088 --> 00:16:12,684
You don't just press "submerge."

221
00:16:12,685 --> 00:16:14,351
I'll figure something out.

222
00:16:15,587 --> 00:16:18,341
For all you know,
I was a commander in the navy.

223
00:16:22,804 --> 00:16:25,520
Put your arm around my neck.
I'll lift under your knees.

224
00:16:25,653 --> 00:16:27,041
What's in the pack, John?

225
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:29,889
If you've met Mikhail, that means

226
00:16:29,923 --> 00:16:31,839
you were in the communications
station...

227
00:16:33,865 --> 00:16:35,920
Which means you found the explosives.

228
00:16:38,249 --> 00:16:40,868
So you're not planning to pilot
the submarine anywhere, are you?

229
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:45,546
You're planning to destroy it.

230
00:16:49,645 --> 00:16:50,922
I know you, John Locke.

231
00:16:55,195 --> 00:16:56,583
You don't know me at all.

232
00:16:58,385 --> 00:17:00,346
I know you were born in California.

233
00:17:01,706 --> 00:17:03,817
I know you were raised in foster care.

234
00:17:04,716 --> 00:17:07,495
I know you wasted
a big part of your life in Tustin

235
00:17:07,667 --> 00:17:10,810
pushing papers at a company
that manufactured industrial boxes.

236
00:17:13,682 --> 00:17:14,931
I know you spent the four years

237
00:17:14,967 --> 00:17:17,914
prior to your arrival on this island
in a wheelchair.

238
00:17:21,611 --> 00:17:23,831
And I know how you ended up in it.

239
00:17:30,552 --> 00:17:31,552
Tell me, John...

240
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:33,832
Did it hurt?

241
00:17:42,724 --> 00:17:44,097
I felt my back break.

242
00:17:47,305 --> 00:17:48,350
What do you think?

243
00:18:14,362 --> 00:18:16,973
I didn't think I'd see you again
so soon, Kate.

244
00:18:21,464 --> 00:18:22,673
Be careful in here.

245
00:18:24,322 --> 00:18:25,322
Thanks.

246
00:18:44,519 --> 00:18:45,576
Did they hurt you?

247
00:18:49,295 --> 00:18:50,295
Did they hurt you?

248
00:18:58,755 --> 00:18:59,755
What is all this?

249
00:19:02,065 --> 00:19:03,398
This is where they live.

250
00:19:05,469 --> 00:19:06,857
And the people they took?

251
00:19:08,327 --> 00:19:09,327
The kids?

252
00:19:09,630 --> 00:19:10,630
They're all safe.

253
00:19:14,281 --> 00:19:15,281
"Safe"?

254
00:19:21,398 --> 00:19:22,584
So you're with them now?

255
00:19:25,875 --> 00:19:27,554
I'm not with anyone, Kate.

256
00:19:32,008 --> 00:19:33,341
What did they do to you?

257
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:36,947
- Nothing.
- Then why are you acting like this?

258
00:19:38,067 --> 00:19:39,106
There's no way...

259
00:19:40,121 --> 00:19:41,584
You... There's no way that I could...

260
00:19:41,654 --> 00:19:42,828
I came here to help you!

261
00:19:42,829 --> 00:19:43,925
So why don't you tell me...

262
00:19:43,926 --> 00:19:46,148
I told you not to come back here for me.

263
00:19:47,627 --> 00:19:49,182
I didn't think you meant it.

264
00:20:27,288 --> 00:20:28,954
What did they do to you, Jack?

265
00:20:35,756 --> 00:20:37,089
I made a deal with them.

266
00:20:38,868 --> 00:20:40,201
They're gonna let me go.

267
00:20:44,119 --> 00:20:45,119
Where?

268
00:20:47,974 --> 00:20:49,008
Home.

269
00:20:57,390 --> 00:20:58,390
When?

270
00:20:59,192 --> 00:21:00,692
First thing in the morning.

271
00:21:04,013 --> 00:21:06,048
I can bring back help.
It's our best chance.

272
00:21:06,112 --> 00:21:07,355
You trust these people?

273
00:21:07,379 --> 00:21:08,963
They are liars. Why would you believe...

274
00:21:08,964 --> 00:21:11,408
I trust them
because you told me to, Kate...

275
00:21:13,559 --> 00:21:16,107
When you asked me
to save Sawyer's life.

276
00:21:25,747 --> 00:21:27,024
What did they tell you?

277
00:21:32,796 --> 00:21:34,804
Jack, we need to go.

278
00:21:38,270 --> 00:21:39,381
I'll be right there.

279
00:21:48,893 --> 00:21:51,653
I asked you not to come back here
for me, and I wish...

280
00:21:54,550 --> 00:21:55,827
I wish that you hadn't.

281
00:22:03,512 --> 00:22:05,243
But I will come back here for you.

282
00:22:37,442 --> 00:22:38,553
John Locke?

283
00:22:39,730 --> 00:22:40,730
Detective Mason.

284
00:22:41,182 --> 00:22:43,800
That's detective Reed. Do you mind
if we ask you a few questions?

285
00:22:43,824 --> 00:22:44,833
No, of course not.

286
00:22:44,857 --> 00:22:46,789
Do you know a man named Peter Talbot?

287
00:22:50,550 --> 00:22:51,720
No, I don't think so.

288
00:22:51,791 --> 00:22:53,916
Thin, brown hair, 20.

289
00:22:54,715 --> 00:22:56,592
If it'll be helpful,
we believe he was here

290
00:22:56,593 --> 00:22:58,087
in your apartment two days ago.

291
00:23:00,025 --> 00:23:01,381
Yeah, he was a solicitor.

292
00:23:01,517 --> 00:23:03,284
I sent him away.

293
00:23:03,365 --> 00:23:07,123
Mr. Talbot's family is worth somewhere
in the neighborhood of $200 million.

294
00:23:08,059 --> 00:23:11,053
So I'm curious. What exactly
was he selling you door-to-door?

295
00:23:11,076 --> 00:23:13,249
Well, I...
Look, I told you I don't know him.

296
00:23:13,272 --> 00:23:16,441
Then why was your name and address
on a piece of paper in his pocket?

297
00:23:19,495 --> 00:23:22,165
Why were you... would you be
looking through his pockets?

298
00:23:22,691 --> 00:23:24,253
Because Peter Talbot's dead.

299
00:23:31,057 --> 00:23:32,557
It wasn't easy, you know...

300
00:23:34,465 --> 00:23:36,807
Being in that hatch with you
all that time...

301
00:23:37,062 --> 00:23:39,450
Knowing you had no business
walking around,

302
00:23:39,961 --> 00:23:43,342
knowing I couldn't even ask you about it
without telling you who I really was.

303
00:23:43,935 --> 00:23:44,935
So ask me now...

304
00:23:47,695 --> 00:23:49,782
Now that I know who you really are.

305
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,400
Was it immediate?

306
00:23:55,954 --> 00:23:57,898
It started the moment you got here?

307
00:24:00,284 --> 00:24:02,233
And you were just walking,
the feeling returned

308
00:24:02,268 --> 00:24:03,712
right after the crash, that day?

309
00:24:03,761 --> 00:24:05,558
That's what "immediate" means, Ben.

310
00:24:08,424 --> 00:24:10,855
You're wondering why
it hasn't happened for you.

311
00:24:12,068 --> 00:24:14,370
You're not recovering
as fast as you like.

312
00:24:16,634 --> 00:24:18,696
How long's it been since Jack fixed you?

313
00:24:19,288 --> 00:24:20,309
A week?

314
00:24:21,239 --> 00:24:22,581
Now that I think about it,

315
00:24:23,297 --> 00:24:24,953
how did you get sick in the first place?

316
00:24:25,071 --> 00:24:26,959
Are you afraid it'll go away, John?

317
00:24:28,195 --> 00:24:30,241
Is that why you want
to destroy the submarine?

318
00:24:30,242 --> 00:24:33,306
'Cause you know if you leave the island,
you'll be back in the chair?

319
00:24:37,429 --> 00:24:38,762
You got anything to eat?

320
00:25:00,535 --> 00:25:03,364
Go on home, kid.
You know you're not supposed to be here.

321
00:25:03,832 --> 00:25:05,720
My father sent me to get his pack.

322
00:25:09,386 --> 00:25:10,386
Why?

323
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:13,100
I don't know, Ryan,
but he told me to get it.

324
00:25:14,016 --> 00:25:15,016
All right.

325
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,320
Here you go.

326
00:25:23,036 --> 00:25:24,369
You're Alex, aren't you?

327
00:25:26,276 --> 00:25:27,298
Hey! Can it.

328
00:25:27,402 --> 00:25:28,767
How do you know my name?

329
00:25:28,911 --> 00:25:30,689
Because you look like your mother.

330
00:25:33,825 --> 00:25:34,917
My mother is dead.

331
00:25:37,159 --> 00:25:39,000
I'm sure that's what they told you.

332
00:25:41,866 --> 00:25:42,866
Get going, Alex!

333
00:25:50,967 --> 00:25:52,196
Keep your mouth shut.

334
00:26:00,846 --> 00:26:02,457
Where do you get electricity?

335
00:26:02,748 --> 00:26:05,117
We have two giant hamsters
running on a massive wheel

336
00:26:05,118 --> 00:26:07,577
- at our secret underground lair.
- Yeah, that's funny.

337
00:26:08,658 --> 00:26:11,006
There's leftovers in the refrigerator.
Help yourself.

338
00:26:22,329 --> 00:26:24,429
I ate most of the dark meat. Sorry.

339
00:26:29,483 --> 00:26:33,376
I never really appreciated chicken
until right now.

340
00:26:35,697 --> 00:26:37,791
I know you think you need
to do this, John,

341
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:39,569
but if you blow up my submarine,

342
00:26:39,747 --> 00:26:41,913
I'll have a big problem with my people.

343
00:26:42,207 --> 00:26:44,682
Is that supposed to be
an incentive not to blow it up?

344
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:49,304
I was born on this island.

345
00:26:49,963 --> 00:26:51,780
Not many of my people can say that.

346
00:26:51,914 --> 00:26:54,073
Most of them were recruited
and brought here.

347
00:26:54,074 --> 00:26:56,074
And as much as they love this place,

348
00:26:56,178 --> 00:26:58,323
as much as they would do anything
to defend it,

349
00:26:58,405 --> 00:27:00,918
they need to know they can leave
if they want to.

350
00:27:02,430 --> 00:27:04,856
The sub maintains that illusion.

351
00:27:05,634 --> 00:27:06,736
So you're lying to 'em.

352
00:27:06,737 --> 00:27:09,139
No. They're here
because they want to be here.

353
00:27:09,194 --> 00:27:12,351
Some of them are just not ready
to make a full... commitment yet.

354
00:27:13,999 --> 00:27:14,999
But you, John...

355
00:27:17,453 --> 00:27:19,453
You've already made that commitment,

356
00:27:19,603 --> 00:27:21,005
and now you have a choice.

357
00:27:21,006 --> 00:27:23,061
Because if you stop and if you think,

358
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:24,617
I can show you things...

359
00:27:25,624 --> 00:27:28,137
things I know you want
to see very badly.

360
00:27:30,612 --> 00:27:32,614
Let me put it so you'll understand.

361
00:27:36,116 --> 00:27:37,161
Picture a box.

362
00:27:38,885 --> 00:27:41,433
You know something about boxes,
don't you, John?

363
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:44,323
What if I told you
that somewhere on this island

364
00:27:44,494 --> 00:27:46,824
there's a very large box,

365
00:27:47,832 --> 00:27:50,729
and whatever you imagined,
whatever you wanted to be in it,

366
00:27:51,802 --> 00:27:55,375
when you opened at box,
there it would be.

367
00:27:58,062 --> 00:28:00,062
What would you say about that, John?

368
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:07,545
I'd say I hope that box is big enough
to imagine yourself up a new submarine.

369
00:28:11,527 --> 00:28:13,916
- Why are you so angry, John?
- Because you're cheating.

370
00:28:14,049 --> 00:28:14,972
You and your people

371
00:28:15,164 --> 00:28:17,814
communicate with the outside world
whenever you want to.

372
00:28:18,235 --> 00:28:19,843
You come and go as you please.

373
00:28:19,845 --> 00:28:22,456
You use electricity
and running water and guns.

374
00:28:22,751 --> 00:28:25,104
You're a hypocrite, a Pharisee.

375
00:28:25,557 --> 00:28:27,403
You don't deserve to be on this island.

376
00:28:27,607 --> 00:28:31,190
If you had any idea
what this place really was,

377
00:28:32,959 --> 00:28:35,400
you wouldn't be putting chicken
in your refrigerator.

378
00:28:35,436 --> 00:28:38,221
You've been here 80 days, John.
I've been here my entire life.

379
00:28:40,036 --> 00:28:43,560
So how is it that you think
you know this island better than I do?

380
00:28:43,889 --> 00:28:45,991
Because you're in the wheelchair,

381
00:28:47,346 --> 00:28:48,346
and I'm not.

382
00:29:04,078 --> 00:29:05,522
Did you have any problems?

383
00:29:12,148 --> 00:29:13,980
Okay, here's how this is gonna work...

384
00:29:14,168 --> 00:29:15,870
she's gonna take me to the sub.

385
00:29:16,005 --> 00:29:17,303
Once we're there, I let her go.

386
00:29:17,355 --> 00:29:19,183
John, she's done enough.
Let me take you.

387
00:29:19,514 --> 00:29:21,385
I don't want you to slow me down.

388
00:29:22,574 --> 00:29:24,406
Come on. Let's go.

389
00:29:24,971 --> 00:29:26,888
John, before you go, you should know...

390
00:29:28,155 --> 00:29:29,435
Jack and I made a deal.

391
00:29:31,036 --> 00:29:32,860
In less than an hour
he's leaving this island

392
00:29:32,907 --> 00:29:35,089
on that submarine,
and it's a 1-way ticket.

393
00:29:35,642 --> 00:29:37,648
The anomaly wiped out
our communications.

394
00:29:37,718 --> 00:29:40,371
We have no way of contacting
the outside world...

395
00:29:40,847 --> 00:29:42,961
Which means when that sub leaves,

396
00:29:44,101 --> 00:29:45,378
it can never come back.

397
00:29:46,305 --> 00:29:47,819
So whether you destroy the submarine

398
00:29:47,889 --> 00:29:50,406
or whether you let it go,
the end result is the same--

399
00:29:51,288 --> 00:29:52,788
no one will find this island.

400
00:29:55,994 --> 00:29:56,994
Let's go.

401
00:29:59,444 --> 00:30:00,606
Come on.

402
00:30:03,408 --> 00:30:05,414
You know he's manipulating you, right?

403
00:30:05,715 --> 00:30:06,715
How's that?

404
00:30:07,163 --> 00:30:09,737
That's what my father does.
He manipulates people.

405
00:30:10,375 --> 00:30:13,041
He makes you think it's your idea,
but it's his.

406
00:30:13,323 --> 00:30:15,045
I'll have to keep that in mind.

407
00:30:25,054 --> 00:30:26,442
Submarine's down there...

408
00:30:26,732 --> 00:30:28,095
At the end of the dock.

409
00:30:30,574 --> 00:30:32,740
I'm sorry I had to involve you in this.

410
00:31:46,351 --> 00:31:48,303
Look, I know you don't owe me anything,

411
00:31:48,630 --> 00:31:50,907
but I need to ask you
for one last favor.

412
00:31:57,192 --> 00:31:58,192
You don't knock?

413
00:32:02,151 --> 00:32:03,873
I need you to let my friends go

414
00:32:04,798 --> 00:32:05,798
after I'm gone.

415
00:32:07,009 --> 00:32:09,842
And if I said no,
would that stop you from leaving?

416
00:32:09,910 --> 00:32:10,965
Of course it would.

417
00:32:16,317 --> 00:32:18,539
Your friends
are only here to rescue you.

418
00:32:19,221 --> 00:32:22,027
But you seem to be doing
a good job of rescuing yourself, so...

419
00:32:25,830 --> 00:32:27,901
I suppose
there's no reason to keep them here.

420
00:32:28,837 --> 00:32:30,392
Do I have your word on that?

421
00:32:34,392 --> 00:32:35,392
You have my word.

422
00:32:37,012 --> 00:32:40,173
I'll let them go
just as soon as you've left the island.

423
00:32:49,667 --> 00:32:51,055
Well, I guess this is it.

424
00:32:56,299 --> 00:32:57,441
Thank you, Ben,

425
00:32:59,085 --> 00:33:00,531
for keeping your promise.

426
00:33:37,944 --> 00:33:39,205
Hold it right there!

427
00:33:39,644 --> 00:33:40,644
Get your hands up!

428
00:33:40,998 --> 00:33:43,211
Get down! I said get down!

429
00:33:54,874 --> 00:33:56,151
What are you doing here, John?

430
00:33:57,375 --> 00:33:58,565
I'm sorry, Jack.

431
00:34:01,884 --> 00:34:02,884
Sorry for what?

432
00:34:30,706 --> 00:34:31,706
What did you do?

433
00:34:33,207 --> 00:34:35,077
Tell me you didn't do it.

434
00:34:35,742 --> 00:34:38,948
- What are you talking about?
- Tell me that you didn't kill that kid!

435
00:34:39,291 --> 00:34:40,291
What?

436
00:34:40,299 --> 00:34:42,745
You think I had something to do
with Peter's death?

437
00:34:42,769 --> 00:34:44,448
I tell you to end things
with his mother,

438
00:34:44,471 --> 00:34:46,024
and the next thing you know, he's dead!

439
00:34:46,048 --> 00:34:47,507
John, now calm down, please.

440
00:34:47,626 --> 00:34:49,998
Think about what you're saying.
Why would I kill Peter?

441
00:34:50,017 --> 00:34:51,017
He was on to you!

442
00:34:51,070 --> 00:34:54,842
I've been doing this for a long time.
I'm not sweating some rich kid.

443
00:34:54,863 --> 00:34:56,073
Then why are you still here?

444
00:34:56,074 --> 00:34:57,800
- What do you mean?
- I tell you to leave.

445
00:34:57,847 --> 00:35:00,821
You tell me you're gonna leave town.
Why are you still here?

446
00:35:01,985 --> 00:35:03,237
Now listen, John,

447
00:35:03,501 --> 00:35:04,881
I'll be honest with you.

448
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:06,840
I didn't end it.

449
00:35:07,346 --> 00:35:08,846
I was looking for an angle.

450
00:35:09,096 --> 00:35:11,442
I wanted to make some money
before I skipped out.

451
00:35:12,203 --> 00:35:13,703
But then all this happened.

452
00:35:14,404 --> 00:35:17,338
Peter died, and everything
just went straight into the tank.

453
00:35:19,223 --> 00:35:20,326
She's devastated.

454
00:35:21,774 --> 00:35:23,114
She's called off the wedding.

455
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:25,586
There's no profit in it, John.

456
00:35:26,469 --> 00:35:28,467
I'm a con man, not a murder.

457
00:35:31,526 --> 00:35:33,026
She called off the wedding?

458
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:36,624
She said she couldn't deal with it.

459
00:35:37,541 --> 00:35:40,824
- She needs to be alone.
- So if I were to call her right now,

460
00:35:41,463 --> 00:35:43,024
that's what she would tell me?

461
00:35:45,869 --> 00:35:47,591
Phone's right over there, John.

462
00:35:54,247 --> 00:35:55,480
What's her numb--

463
00:36:01,579 --> 00:36:04,438
Mr. Locke, we know this isn't
what you want to hear, but...

464
00:36:05,372 --> 00:36:06,427
Your father's gone.

465
00:36:07,682 --> 00:36:10,111
We know he fled to Mexico
shortly after your...

466
00:36:10,352 --> 00:36:12,806
encounter, then he disappeared.

467
00:36:13,791 --> 00:36:16,932
I'm sorry, but he could be
anywhere in the world right now.

468
00:36:19,287 --> 00:36:20,289
All right, detectives,

469
00:36:20,540 --> 00:36:23,126
that's enough.
Mr. Locke has work to do today.

470
00:36:25,512 --> 00:36:27,734
We'll let you know if anything develops.

471
00:36:30,579 --> 00:36:33,932
We have got ourselves quite a day
ahead of us, my friend.

472
00:36:34,505 --> 00:36:36,730
It's finally time
to get you up out of that bed.

473
00:36:36,996 --> 00:36:38,507
No. I don't want to.

474
00:36:38,628 --> 00:36:39,823
I don't remember asking.

475
00:36:45,788 --> 00:36:46,788
Now...

476
00:36:47,441 --> 00:36:49,515
Most people struggle with this at first,

477
00:36:49,668 --> 00:36:50,800
but don't worry.

478
00:36:51,646 --> 00:36:52,868
You'll get used to it.

479
00:36:54,611 --> 00:36:56,590
No, please. I can't do this.

480
00:36:57,719 --> 00:36:59,658
You fell eight stories and survived.

481
00:37:00,859 --> 00:37:02,704
I don't want to hear
about what you can't do.

482
00:37:02,922 --> 00:37:04,060
Now let's go.

483
00:37:04,065 --> 00:37:05,130
It's gonna be all right.

484
00:37:05,469 --> 00:37:06,568
It's gonna be fine, John.

485
00:37:06,569 --> 00:37:08,126
- Come on.
- No, I can't...

486
00:37:14,456 --> 00:37:15,684
You're fine...

487
00:37:18,083 --> 00:37:19,083
There we go.

488
00:37:19,898 --> 00:37:21,147
There you go, buddy.

489
00:37:22,895 --> 00:37:23,964
See?

490
00:37:25,093 --> 00:37:26,426
Wasn't that bad, was it?

491
00:37:27,255 --> 00:37:28,665
Be right back, buddy.

492
00:38:06,859 --> 00:38:09,470
Well, John,
you've really gone and done it now.

493
00:38:10,544 --> 00:38:13,421
You don't have to pretend
to be disappointed anymore.

494
00:38:13,967 --> 00:38:16,180
We both know you wanted it to happen.

495
00:38:17,569 --> 00:38:19,928
That's why you left the c4
in Sayid's bag

496
00:38:20,026 --> 00:38:22,358
Because you wanted me to make it happen.

497
00:38:23,982 --> 00:38:25,485
Uncuff him, please, Richard.

498
00:38:31,551 --> 00:38:33,162
You gonna do anything stupid?

499
00:38:34,511 --> 00:38:35,511
No, sir.

500
00:38:41,274 --> 00:38:44,770
Do you remember earlier, John,
when you called me a cheater...

501
00:38:45,721 --> 00:38:48,711
When you said I didn't deserve
to live on this island? Well, get this--

502
00:38:48,934 --> 00:38:51,296
There I was, shaking hands with Jack

503
00:38:51,863 --> 00:38:54,325
and thinking I'd give almost anything
to come up with a way

504
00:38:54,402 --> 00:38:57,020
to stop him from leaving,
because to let him go

505
00:38:57,592 --> 00:39:00,152
would be a sign a weakness,
of failure, of defeat.

506
00:39:00,677 --> 00:39:03,179
My people would see that.
They would know it,

507
00:39:03,770 --> 00:39:05,496
and that, John, would be the end of me.

508
00:39:05,985 --> 00:39:06,985
But to kill him...

509
00:39:09,391 --> 00:39:10,719
That would be cheating,

510
00:39:11,404 --> 00:39:13,469
because my people
also heard me make a promise,

511
00:39:13,470 --> 00:39:14,862
and to break my word...

512
00:39:16,454 --> 00:39:18,287
that would be the end of me, too.

513
00:39:22,072 --> 00:39:25,611
And then you came striding out
of the jungle, John...

514
00:39:28,025 --> 00:39:30,407
to you make my dream come true.

515
00:39:33,337 --> 00:39:36,892
You're not gonna start talking
about the magic box again, are you?

516
00:39:41,019 --> 00:39:43,031
I'm gonna show you what came out of it.

517
00:39:55,767 --> 00:39:57,618
When I asked you earlier if it hurt

518
00:39:57,619 --> 00:40:00,706
when you suffered your injury,
I think you misunderstood me.

519
00:40:00,886 --> 00:40:04,102
It seems fairly obvious
that when a person's back smashes

520
00:40:04,126 --> 00:40:06,456
into a hard surface after being thrown
from a building,

521
00:40:06,515 --> 00:40:08,230
that's gonna sting a little.

522
00:40:08,698 --> 00:40:11,312
But I really wasn't asking
about the physical pain.

523
00:40:12,601 --> 00:40:14,567
What, do you want to know
if it hurt my feelings?

524
00:40:14,602 --> 00:40:17,141
No, John.
I wanted to know what it felt like

525
00:40:17,209 --> 00:40:19,375
when your own father tried to kill you.

526
00:40:22,969 --> 00:40:25,878
He's the reason you destroyed
the submarine, isn't he?

527
00:40:27,224 --> 00:40:28,224
You're afraid.

528
00:40:29,076 --> 00:40:32,429
You're afraid of him, and this is
the one place he can never find you.

529
00:40:32,514 --> 00:40:34,481
This is the one place
he can never get to.

530
00:40:34,482 --> 00:40:35,870
What do you want from me?

531
00:40:39,392 --> 00:40:40,848
I don't know how it happened...

532
00:40:43,097 --> 00:40:46,849
But you seem to have
some communion with this island, John,

533
00:40:47,279 --> 00:40:49,392
and that makes you very, very important.

534
00:40:50,861 --> 00:40:53,056
You have no idea
what you're talking about, of course,

535
00:40:53,091 --> 00:40:56,130
but in time you'll have
a better understanding of things.

536
00:40:58,115 --> 00:40:59,115
So what do I want?

537
00:41:00,873 --> 00:41:02,261
I want to help you, John.

538
00:41:04,874 --> 00:41:05,895
Why?

539
00:41:07,382 --> 00:41:09,826
Because I'm in a wheelchair,
and you're not.

540
00:41:16,546 --> 00:41:17,712
Are you ready to see?

541
00:41:59,303 --> 00:42:00,303
Dad?
