00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:01,720
<i>Previously on Lost...</i>

2
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:03,700
This is not your island.

3
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:05,418
This is our island.

4
00:00:05,587 --> 00:00:10,312
<i>They've attacked us, sabotaged us,
abducted us, murdered us.</i>

5
00:00:10,601 --> 00:00:14,195
<i>We're not the only people
on this island, and we all know it!</i>

6
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:17,156
<i>They came the first night,
took three of us,</i>

7
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:20,833
<i>then they came back
and took nine more.</i>

8
00:00:20,927 --> 00:00:23,537
<i>They're smart,
and they're animals.</i>

9
00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:25,014
You're coming with us.

10
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:37,165
I burnt my hand...and my muffins.

11
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:41,865
Still hasn't fixed your plumbing yet?

12
00:01:42,010 --> 00:01:44,220
<i>It's a work in progress.</i>

13
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,289
It's not even literature. It's popcorn.

14
00:01:48,383 --> 00:01:50,114
And why isn't it literature, Adam?

15
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:51,952
- I'm dying to know.
- There's no metaphor.

16
00:01:52,009 --> 00:01:53,970
<i>It's by the numbers,
religious hokum-pokum.</i>

17
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:55,571
<i>- No metaphor?
- It's science fiction.</i>

18
00:01:55,637 --> 00:01:57,028
<i>Now I know why Ben isn't here.</i>

19
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,164
Excuse me?

20
00:01:58,370 --> 00:02:00,851
I know the host picks the book,
but seriously, Julie,

21
00:02:00,948 --> 00:02:03,045
he wouldn't read this
in the damned bathroom.

22
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:04,810
Well, Adam,

23
00:02:05,427 --> 00:02:08,576
I am the host, and i do pick the book,

24
00:02:08,623 --> 00:02:11,217
and this, is my favorite book,

25
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:16,229
so I am absolutely thrilled
that you can't stand it.

26
00:02:16,286 --> 00:02:17,834
Silly me for sinking so low

27
00:02:17,835 --> 00:02:20,586
as to select something
that Ben wouldn't like.

28
00:02:20,727 --> 00:02:24,628
Here I am, thinking that free will
still actually exists on...

29
00:02:26,856 --> 00:02:29,050
In the doorway, get in the door way.

30
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:25,700
Goodwin!

31
00:03:28,103 --> 00:03:30,712
- You see where the tail landed?
- Yeah, probably in the water.

32
00:03:30,781 --> 00:03:32,540
You run,
you can make that shore in 1 h.

33
00:03:32,619 --> 00:03:34,490
Ethan, get up there to that fuselage.

34
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:36,023
There may actually be survivors,

35
00:03:36,736 --> 00:03:37,985
and you're one of them.

36
00:03:38,057 --> 00:03:39,691
A passenger, you're in shock.

37
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:41,529
Come up with an adequate story
if they ask.

38
00:03:41,586 --> 00:03:42,790
Stay quiet if they don't.

39
00:03:42,874 --> 00:03:45,109
Listen. Learn. Don't get involved.

40
00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:46,870
I want lists in three days.

41
00:03:46,933 --> 00:03:47,935
Go.

42
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,017
So I guess I'm out of the book club.

45
00:06:42,272 --> 00:06:43,274
Kate!

46
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,412
Can you hear me?!

47
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:03,708
Rise and shine, Kate.

48
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,371
Where am I?

49
00:07:10,650 --> 00:07:13,350
You don't really think
I'm going to answer that, do you?

50
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,514
Where are Sawyer and Jack?

51
00:07:17,090 --> 00:07:18,334
I'll tell you what.

52
00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:21,091
Why don't you just take
a nice hot shower?

53
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:22,634
Wake yourself up.

54
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:24,145
Wash the day off you and...

55
00:07:24,746 --> 00:07:25,770
start fresh.

56
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:28,472
It's a nice clean towel,
shampoo, soap...

57
00:07:28,557 --> 00:07:30,446
I'm not showering in front of you.

58
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:35,954
You're not my type.

59
00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:34,770
Where are we?

60
00:08:38,122 --> 00:08:39,309
Who the hell are you?

61
00:08:43,230 --> 00:08:44,737
You ain't gonna talk to me?

62
00:08:46,210 --> 00:08:48,260
What,
you got more important things to do?

63
00:09:23,924 --> 00:09:24,944
<i>Warning.</i>

64
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:34,349
<i>Warning.</i>

65
00:09:37,104 --> 00:09:38,324
I wouldn't do that.

66
00:09:40,090 --> 00:09:42,413
I want your advice, I'll ask for it.

67
00:09:47,822 --> 00:09:49,579
Son of a bitch!

68
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:51,990
Told you.

69
00:10:18,258 --> 00:10:19,444
<i>Stop that.</i>

70
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:30,434
Hi, Jack.

71
00:10:32,930 --> 00:10:33,964
I'm Juliet.

72
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:43,178
- Hi.
- Yes?

73
00:10:43,774 --> 00:10:44,859
I'm Jack Shephard.

74
00:10:44,930 --> 00:10:48,140
- I'm here for the...
- Where's your lawyer?

75
00:10:57,330 --> 00:10:58,479
You look pretty.

76
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:01,559
Where's your lawyer?

77
00:11:06,316 --> 00:11:07,453
I fired him.

78
00:11:10,905 --> 00:11:11,926
Sarah...

79
00:11:14,963 --> 00:11:17,140
I'm sorry, for...

80
00:11:17,842 --> 00:11:20,194
for pushing us to this place.

81
00:11:20,810 --> 00:11:22,085
I know that I...

82
00:11:26,604 --> 00:11:28,356
Excuse me, I'm sorry.

83
00:11:29,975 --> 00:11:31,005
Yeah?

84
00:11:33,695 --> 00:11:35,532
No, not yet. He just got here.

85
00:11:39,265 --> 00:11:40,934
<i>I'll call you when I get out.</i>

86
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:49,879
Jack, I'm gonna say this

87
00:11:49,948 --> 00:11:52,114
- as simply as I can.
- What's his name?

88
00:11:52,330 --> 00:11:53,780
- Jack, stop it.
- I won't.

89
00:11:53,841 --> 00:11:56,450
I'm gonna keep asking you that
until you tell me.

90
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:57,980
I don't ask you what you're doing...

91
00:11:58,063 --> 00:11:59,604
Just tell me what his name is.

92
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:00,862
I wanna know,

93
00:12:02,013 --> 00:12:03,180
who he is.

94
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:06,583
Look, you can have everything,
the cars, the house.

95
00:12:06,679 --> 00:12:08,254
I don't care. I just...

96
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:09,866
I just wanna know,

97
00:12:11,271 --> 00:12:13,563
the name of the man...

98
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:16,567
that is with my wife.

99
00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:38,292
Jack?

100
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,454
Can you hear me in there?

101
00:12:47,310 --> 00:12:48,540
Is that a "yes"?

102
00:12:48,830 --> 00:12:50,116
Where are my friends?

103
00:12:50,410 --> 00:12:51,923
Come down from the table first.

104
00:12:52,190 --> 00:12:55,028
You want me to come down,
come in here and get me down.

105
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:58,906
- If you wanna talk, I'm happy...
- Tell me where my friends are!

106
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:02,940
I will...if you let go of the chain.

107
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:05,848
You think I'm stupid?!

108
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:12,150
I don't think you're stupid, Jack.

109
00:13:13,390 --> 00:13:14,924
I think you're stubborn.

110
00:13:48,690 --> 00:13:50,181
Where are my clothes?!

111
00:14:20,264 --> 00:14:21,450
Come on, Kate.

112
00:14:21,811 --> 00:14:22,912
He's waiting.

113
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:36,747
Sorry, I'm going to have to ask you
to put those on, Kate.

114
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:39,219
And if I don't?

115
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,830
Then you don't get any coffee.

116
00:15:57,260 --> 00:15:58,748
A little tighter.

117
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,470
Please?

118
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,679
What did you do with Sawyer and Jack?

119
00:16:16,794 --> 00:16:18,412
Now, why Sawyer?

120
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:20,876
Why Sawyer what?

121
00:16:21,112 --> 00:16:22,961
He's the first one you asked about:

122
00:16:23,444 --> 00:16:26,237
"what did you do with Sawyer and Jack?"

123
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,289
You don't know me.

124
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:31,846
Of course I don't.

125
00:16:34,636 --> 00:16:36,039
I want my clothes back.

126
00:16:36,281 --> 00:16:37,484
We burned them.

127
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:41,922
Why did you bring me here?

128
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:45,040
Why did you make me put on this dress?

129
00:16:45,758 --> 00:16:47,761
Why are you feeding me breakfast?

130
00:16:51,251 --> 00:16:54,619
I brought you here so you'd look out
at the water and feel comforted.

131
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:57,979
Comforted that your friends
were looking out at the same ocean.

132
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,919
I gave you the dress
so you'd feel like a lady,

133
00:17:03,650 --> 00:17:06,977
and I wanted you to eat
your food with a real live fork

134
00:17:07,353 --> 00:17:08,836
and feel civilized.

135
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:13,577
I did all those things so that

136
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:16,242
you'd have something nice to hold on to.

137
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:19,377
Because, Kate...

138
00:17:21,630 --> 00:17:22,925
the next two weeks

139
00:17:23,477 --> 00:17:25,505
are going to bevery unpleasant.

140
00:17:35,170 --> 00:17:36,854
Yeah, hi.

141
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:41,391
I met a woman on the train, Sarah, and,

142
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:44,433
she dropped her cell phone,
and I don't even know her last name,

143
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:47,647
but your number was in her phone,
so I was just wondering...

144
00:17:48,990 --> 00:17:51,320
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Forget it.

145
00:17:52,072 --> 00:17:53,612
Just give me a minute, dad.

146
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:59,120
I asked you to give me a minute here.

147
00:17:59,190 --> 00:18:00,215
What's this?

148
00:18:01,530 --> 00:18:04,263
Why are you dialing all the numbers
on Sarah's cell phone?

149
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:06,320
Because one of them is him.

150
00:18:06,887 --> 00:18:08,473
You gotta stop this, Jack.

151
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:11,769
- It's over.
- Not until I know his name,

152
00:18:12,251 --> 00:18:14,403
where he works, where he lives.

153
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:17,952
When they first kissed.
I wanna know what it is about him.

154
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:24,938
<i>Mrs. Owens, call the operator.</i>

155
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:27,659
<i>Mrs. Owens, call the operator, please.</i>

156
00:18:27,810 --> 00:18:29,985
Why is Sarah calling you, dad?

157
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:34,198
I think it's time that you let this go.

158
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:38,415
- Why is she calling you?
- Because she was afraid...for you.

159
00:18:38,498 --> 00:18:40,078
I wanna know exactly

160
00:18:40,133 --> 00:18:42,939
- why the hell she would call you!
- She saw that you were slipping.

161
00:18:42,991 --> 00:18:45,499
- You were losing your grip.
- My grip is not the problem.

162
00:18:45,555 --> 00:18:47,210
Which is exactly what's happening here.

163
00:18:47,306 --> 00:18:48,484
Jack! Come...

164
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:51,810
I think I know a little something
about being obsessive.

165
00:18:51,906 --> 00:18:53,906
No, being a drunk

166
00:18:54,555 --> 00:18:56,472
is not obsessive.

167
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:11,632
Let it go, jack.

168
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:46,925
What?!

169
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:52,328
If you're trying to talk to me,
I can't hear you!

170
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:55,233
<i>Let it go, Jack.</i>

171
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:01,620
I know you're hungry.

172
00:20:01,728 --> 00:20:03,106
I brought this for you.

173
00:20:05,230 --> 00:20:06,830
This is how it will work.

174
00:20:07,070 --> 00:20:11,199
You sit there, across from the door,
back against the wall.

175
00:20:12,095 --> 00:20:13,875
I open the door and leave the tray.

176
00:20:15,170 --> 00:20:17,101
Can I trust you to do that, Jack?

177
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:21,877
I don't want your food.

178
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:23,650
It's a delicious sandwich...

179
00:20:23,670 --> 00:20:24,730
I want you to tell the guy

180
00:20:24,731 --> 00:20:26,482
who's talking to me
through that intercom

181
00:20:26,648 --> 00:20:28,132
that he can give it up!

182
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:31,136
Maybe you're hungrier than you think.

183
00:20:31,193 --> 00:20:33,229
That intercom hasn't worked in years.

184
00:20:35,210 --> 00:20:36,691
What's that for?

185
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,522
The button-- what it's for?

186
00:20:39,470 --> 00:20:40,787
It's for emergencies.

187
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:42,909
Who's watching me?

188
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:47,433
Are you going to sit against the wall
so I can open the door?

189
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:50,552
It's...just off the frying pan.

190
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:52,875
You can have it.

191
00:20:59,490 --> 00:21:00,781
What do you do, Jack?

192
00:21:00,970 --> 00:21:02,645
What's your profession?

193
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:05,417
I'm a repo man.

194
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:08,551
You know,
when people don't pay their bills,

195
00:21:08,552 --> 00:21:09,632
I go in for the bank,

196
00:21:09,803 --> 00:21:11,362
and I collect their possessions.

197
00:21:12,392 --> 00:21:14,516
I'm a people person,
so I really love it.

198
00:21:15,070 --> 00:21:16,265
Are you married?

199
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:21,127
I never saw the point.

200
00:21:21,690 --> 00:21:22,867
What about you?

201
00:21:23,951 --> 00:21:25,420
What's your job, besides

202
00:21:26,163 --> 00:21:27,688
making sandwiches?

203
00:21:28,045 --> 00:21:30,478
I didn't make it.
I just put the toothpicks in.

204
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:38,416
When your plane crashed,

205
00:21:38,871 --> 00:21:40,205
where were you flying from?

206
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:50,462
Sydney.

207
00:21:51,470 --> 00:21:52,929
What were you doing there?

208
00:21:54,005 --> 00:21:55,688
I was bringing my father home.

209
00:21:56,330 --> 00:21:58,431
Why would you go all the way
to australia just to...

210
00:21:58,486 --> 00:21:59,742
...because he was dead.

211
00:22:03,090 --> 00:22:04,152
I'm sorry.

212
00:22:07,752 --> 00:22:09,023
I'm sure you are.

213
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:10,949
Thanks.

214
00:22:18,777 --> 00:22:20,233
You can trust me, Jack.

215
00:22:22,310 --> 00:22:23,661
I'm not gonna hurt you.

216
00:22:33,991 --> 00:22:35,590
What the hell is going on here?

217
00:23:08,507 --> 00:23:10,799
How long would it take
to get to your camp?

218
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:13,322
What, you're talking to me now, Chachi?

219
00:23:15,037 --> 00:23:17,253
From where they got you,
how long a walk was it--

220
00:23:17,310 --> 00:23:18,437
Day? Two days?

221
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:22,075
Hey, what are the people like--
from your plane?

222
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:23,794
Oh, they're just awesome.

223
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:28,389
Last one of you boys came for a visit
got tortured by our iraqi.

224
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:30,238
He tortured me, too.

225
00:23:31,214 --> 00:23:33,802
Well, hell, he don't know any better.

226
00:23:38,406 --> 00:23:39,773
<i>Subject escape.</i>

227
00:23:40,050 --> 00:23:41,455
<i>Subject escape.</i>

228
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:44,963
How'd you get out of there?

229
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:46,420
<i>Subject escape.</i>

230
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:49,920
You run that way.

231
00:23:49,978 --> 00:23:51,645
- Hold on...
- You run that way!

232
00:23:52,770 --> 00:23:54,130
<i>Subject escape.</i>

233
00:24:42,702 --> 00:24:43,878
Say it!

234
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:45,477
Say it, Karl.

235
00:24:47,333 --> 00:24:50,203
I'm...sorry.

236
00:24:52,110 --> 00:24:55,059
Sorry I involved you
in my breakout attempt.

237
00:25:23,210 --> 00:25:25,235
The drugs we gave you
when we brought you here

238
00:25:25,313 --> 00:25:28,337
have a fairly serious side effect--
dehydration.

239
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:30,100
Your head is probably sore.

240
00:25:30,217 --> 00:25:31,439
Your throat is raw,

241
00:25:31,536 --> 00:25:33,924
and if you don't eat
or drink something soon,

242
00:25:33,981 --> 00:25:35,946
you're going to start hallucinating.

243
00:25:39,765 --> 00:25:41,152
So you're a doctor, huh?

244
00:25:43,090 --> 00:25:44,092
No.

245
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:46,204
I'm a repo woman.

246
00:25:50,650 --> 00:25:51,958
No strings attached.

247
00:25:52,410 --> 00:25:54,410
You don't have to answer any questions.

248
00:25:54,518 --> 00:25:56,347
You don't have to do anything

249
00:25:56,405 --> 00:25:59,140
but sit with your back
up against the far wall.

250
00:25:59,294 --> 00:26:02,316
Let me open that door,
put the plate down and leave.

251
00:26:05,396 --> 00:26:07,428
I know it feels like you're giving up,

252
00:26:08,055 --> 00:26:11,343
like you're losing if you do
anything that I ask you to.

253
00:26:11,914 --> 00:26:13,175
But you're not.

254
00:26:13,770 --> 00:26:15,296
You need to eat.

255
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:21,384
What do you say?

256
00:26:57,417 --> 00:26:58,679
Thank you, Jack.

257
00:27:06,897 --> 00:27:10,161
Let's take out the epidural catheter
and get him startedon a P. C. A.

258
00:27:12,190 --> 00:27:13,473
<i>Excuse me just a second.</i>

259
00:27:13,851 --> 00:27:16,845
You sure he's ready
to self-administer his pain meds?

260
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:18,260
Hello?

261
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:29,616
<i>Dr. Shephard?</i>

262
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:17,037
- Jack?
- Give me your cell phone.

263
00:28:17,130 --> 00:28:19,388
- What?
- I wanna see it. Now.

264
00:28:19,510 --> 00:28:21,086
Look where you are, Jack.

265
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:23,251
Just look around you, please.

266
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:26,692
- Okay?
- Give me the phone!

267
00:28:26,877 --> 00:28:28,996
This is not the place for this.

268
00:28:29,088 --> 00:28:30,320
You must be Jack.

269
00:28:30,637 --> 00:28:32,967
Why don't you, grab a chair and join us?

270
00:28:40,361 --> 00:28:41,363
You...

271
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:42,940
You know me?

272
00:28:43,152 --> 00:28:44,153
Yes.

273
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:46,090
Your father's told us all about you.

274
00:28:46,174 --> 00:28:47,970
Yeah? What's he told you about me?

275
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:49,691
What'd you tell 'em about me, dad--

276
00:28:49,787 --> 00:28:52,003
that your--
your son never really had it?

277
00:28:52,462 --> 00:28:53,849
Not like the old man.

278
00:28:54,830 --> 00:28:57,179
I didn't have the will
to make it work-- my--

279
00:28:57,737 --> 00:29:00,285
my life, my job, my marriage?

280
00:29:00,382 --> 00:29:02,730
What'd you tell 'em
about my marriage, dad?!

281
00:29:05,170 --> 00:29:07,105
You know how he manages his marriage?

282
00:29:08,053 --> 00:29:10,383
A bottle of scotch
every night before dinner.

283
00:29:10,551 --> 00:29:13,344
Your father has been sober 50 days now.

284
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:15,192
We're very proud of that.

285
00:29:19,131 --> 00:29:20,447
Dad!

286
00:29:22,190 --> 00:29:25,137
I wonder what--
what helped you turn that corner?

287
00:29:25,961 --> 00:29:27,388
You think maybe it was--

288
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,234
a new lady friend?
You think maybe that's what it was--

289
00:29:30,268 --> 00:29:32,118
- I will not let you talk to me--
- I will not

290
00:29:32,176 --> 00:29:34,126
sleep with my wife

291
00:29:38,003 --> 00:29:40,180
Jack, I'm your father.

292
00:29:40,632 --> 00:29:42,577
Jack, please, just let it go!

293
00:30:08,073 --> 00:30:09,165
Which way out?

294
00:30:09,281 --> 00:30:10,480
Don't do this, Jack.

295
00:30:10,604 --> 00:30:12,254
Don't. Don't.

296
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:29,633
- Open the door.
- No, I can't Jack. I do that, we die.

297
00:30:29,710 --> 00:30:31,230
- You're lying to me.
- I'm not.

298
00:30:31,250 --> 00:30:32,787
- Open the door!
- I swear I can't!

299
00:30:32,823 --> 00:30:34,383
<i>She's telling the truth, Jack.</i>

300
00:30:39,107 --> 00:30:40,320
I swear to god...

301
00:30:41,060 --> 00:30:42,312
I will kill her.

302
00:30:43,774 --> 00:30:44,776
Okay.

303
00:30:48,310 --> 00:30:50,612
Have her open the door,
and she dies anyway.

304
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:52,939
We all do.

305
00:31:29,922 --> 00:31:31,116
Over here!

306
00:31:51,355 --> 00:31:52,568
The button!

307
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:55,155
- What?!
- The yellow button! The button!

308
00:32:53,157 --> 00:32:54,268
<i>Warning.</i>

309
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:02,477
Gotcha, doc!

310
00:33:05,178 --> 00:33:06,333
<i>Reward!</i>

311
00:33:06,445 --> 00:33:07,563
<i>Reward!</i>

312
00:33:14,030 --> 00:33:15,320
Oh, come on.

313
00:33:20,610 --> 00:33:22,029
Unbelievable.

314
00:33:33,553 --> 00:33:34,728
<i>Keep movin'.</i>

315
00:33:55,495 --> 00:33:58,500
Stick your hands out through the bars.
I'll take off your cuffs.

316
00:33:59,573 --> 00:34:01,827
They scratched you up
pretty bad, didn't they?

317
00:34:02,070 --> 00:34:04,002
I'll bring you some antiseptic later.

318
00:34:04,530 --> 00:34:06,277
How about you bring mean an ottoman?

319
00:34:06,896 --> 00:34:09,168
While you're at it,
I could use a blow-dry.

320
00:34:11,172 --> 00:34:13,079
You got yourself a fish biscuit.

321
00:34:13,700 --> 00:34:14,915
How'd you do that?

322
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:17,677
I figured out
your complicated gizmos, that's how.

323
00:34:17,792 --> 00:34:19,795
Only took the bears two hours.

324
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:23,766
How many of 'em were there?

325
00:34:28,590 --> 00:34:29,965
You okay, freckles?

326
00:34:33,910 --> 00:34:34,931
Yeah.

327
00:34:36,070 --> 00:34:37,072
You?

328
00:34:37,710 --> 00:34:38,960
Just swell.

329
00:34:40,140 --> 00:34:42,203
I requested that cage, but whatever.

330
00:34:51,660 --> 00:34:52,835
Nice dress.

331
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:56,371
They made me wear it.

332
00:35:05,926 --> 00:35:07,101
Are you hungry?

333
00:35:56,257 --> 00:35:57,605
It's an aquarium.

334
00:36:00,330 --> 00:36:01,426
Excuse me?

335
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:03,250
This thing's for what...

336
00:36:04,676 --> 00:36:05,959
sharks?

337
00:36:06,830 --> 00:36:08,182
Dolphins, too.

338
00:36:16,830 --> 00:36:18,332
We're underwater, aren't we?

339
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:20,001
Yes.

340
00:36:21,740 --> 00:36:23,160
Is this one of their...

341
00:36:23,590 --> 00:36:26,153
stations-- the--
the Dharma Initiative?

342
00:36:26,790 --> 00:36:28,306
They called it the Hydra.

343
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:32,730
So you people are just...

344
00:36:35,276 --> 00:36:36,837
whatever's leftover of them?

345
00:36:39,409 --> 00:36:41,064
Well, that was a long time ago.

346
00:36:44,975 --> 00:36:46,304
It doesn't matter...

347
00:36:48,109 --> 00:36:49,380
who we were.

348
00:36:51,010 --> 00:36:52,674
It only matters who we are.

349
00:36:54,989 --> 00:36:57,965
We know exactly who you are,
Jack Shephard.

350
00:36:58,390 --> 00:37:00,134
You don't know anything about me.

351
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:03,522
We know that you're a spinal surgeon

352
00:37:03,715 --> 00:37:06,702
based out of St. Sebastian's hospital
in Los Angeles.

353
00:37:07,110 --> 00:37:08,627
I know that you went to Columbia,

354
00:37:08,762 --> 00:37:12,319
and you graduated med school
a year faster than anyone else.

355
00:37:13,190 --> 00:37:14,701
I know that you were married,

356
00:37:15,125 --> 00:37:16,454
only once,

357
00:37:16,661 --> 00:37:18,549
and that you contested the divorce.

358
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:23,159
I know your father died in Sydney.

359
00:37:24,334 --> 00:37:25,788
I know this because

360
00:37:26,491 --> 00:37:28,974
I have a copy of his autopsy report.

361
00:37:32,492 --> 00:37:33,590
How...

362
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:37,265
- How did you get--
- we got it.

363
00:37:41,530 --> 00:37:42,776
What is that?

364
00:37:45,390 --> 00:37:46,882
This, Jack...

365
00:37:48,405 --> 00:37:49,695
is your life.

366
00:37:53,180 --> 00:37:54,423
Do you...

367
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:58,565
is it just about me,
or is it about my family, too? My...

368
00:37:59,260 --> 00:38:00,420
My friends?

369
00:38:01,350 --> 00:38:03,139
It's pretty much about everything.

370
00:38:06,130 --> 00:38:07,618
Do you know about my...

371
00:38:09,810 --> 00:38:11,389
About my ex-wife?

372
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:13,194
Sarah.

373
00:38:15,140 --> 00:38:16,295
Yes, Jack.

374
00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:18,400
We know all about her.

375
00:38:23,186 --> 00:38:24,996
What would you like to find out?

376
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:35,529
Shephard, someone posted your bail.

377
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:52,412
How'd you...

378
00:38:52,527 --> 00:38:54,232
Your dad told me you were here.

379
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:00,220
I called you a cab.

380
00:39:01,420 --> 00:39:02,455
So...

381
00:39:04,140 --> 00:39:05,378
good-bye.

382
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:22,794
Sarah!

383
00:39:23,168 --> 00:39:24,209
What?

384
00:39:25,830 --> 00:39:26,963
Is that him?

385
00:39:27,146 --> 00:39:29,059
- What difference does it make?
- It just does.

386
00:39:29,098 --> 00:39:31,545
- It's not gonna change anything.
- Look, I wanna know!

387
00:39:33,504 --> 00:39:34,737
I need to know who he is.

388
00:39:34,775 --> 00:39:36,020
It doesn't matter who he is.

389
00:39:36,073 --> 00:39:37,837
It just matters who you're not.

390
00:39:46,210 --> 00:39:47,443
Your father...

391
00:39:48,250 --> 00:39:51,929
when he called me...to help you...

392
00:39:54,710 --> 00:39:57,427
he was so drunk,
I could hardly understand him.

393
00:40:06,549 --> 00:40:08,090
Look at the bright side.

394
00:40:10,228 --> 00:40:12,174
Now you have something to fix.

395
00:40:30,740 --> 00:40:32,648
What would you like to find out?

396
00:40:38,570 --> 00:40:39,901
Is she...

397
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:44,185
Is she happy?

398
00:40:47,230 --> 00:40:49,420
Yes, Jack.

399
00:40:49,514 --> 00:40:50,997
She's very happy.

400
00:41:04,850 --> 00:41:08,072
Now I'd like to bring you
some food and water,

401
00:41:08,272 --> 00:41:11,158
but this time I need to know
that you'll behave.

402
00:41:12,620 --> 00:41:14,181
Can I trust you, Jack?

403
00:41:22,057 --> 00:41:25,024
Put your back against the wall, please.

404
00:41:59,236 --> 00:42:00,623
Good work, Juliet.

405
00:42:04,030 --> 00:42:05,308
Thank you, Ben.
