1
00:00:01,786 --> 00:00:03,162
Isn't this nice?

2
00:00:03,255 --> 00:00:05,777
I kind of... prefer breathing.

3
00:00:06,291 --> 00:00:10,370
Come on, you're doing great.
You know, exercise is addictive.

4
00:00:11,118 --> 00:00:12,206
Wow...

5
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:13,952
I can...

6
00:00:15,308 --> 00:00:16,922
I can see why.

7
00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:25,518
Guess I need to
drop a few pounds.

8
00:00:25,658 --> 00:00:28,991
Don't be so hard on yourself.
It's not going to happen overnight.

9
00:00:29,318 --> 00:00:32,699
Some people's metabolisms
are just a little slower.

10
00:00:34,146 --> 00:00:36,710
It's not my metabolism.

11
00:00:40,033 --> 00:00:41,894
I'm sick.

12
00:00:42,736 --> 00:00:43,533
What?

13
00:00:45,730 --> 00:00:47,155
What's wrong?

14
00:00:50,059 --> 00:00:51,572
Never mind.

15
00:00:52,326 --> 00:00:53,503
Hurley!

16
00:00:55,375 --> 00:00:57,322
You can trust me.

17
00:01:01,117 --> 00:01:02,202
Okay.

18
00:01:04,955 --> 00:01:07,291
But... it's bad.

19
00:01:16,647 --> 00:01:20,870
When we first crashed here,
I thought this isn't all bad.

20
00:01:20,967 --> 00:01:23,290
It's like the all-mango diet.

21
00:01:23,388 --> 00:01:25,253
I wasn't turning any
heads or nothing,

22
00:01:25,285 --> 00:01:27,762
but I did drop a
couple belt sizes.

23
00:01:28,365 --> 00:01:30,362
Then we found this hatch,

24
00:01:30,648 --> 00:01:32,302
and it was full of food...

25
00:01:32,915 --> 00:01:34,411
tons of food.

26
00:01:35,628 --> 00:01:37,860
I tried giving it
all away, but...

27
00:01:39,547 --> 00:01:43,052
I guess I kinda kept
some of it for myself.

28
00:01:46,748 --> 00:01:48,453
Wish I could just
get rid of it.

29
00:01:49,396 --> 00:01:50,860
Then get rid of it.

30
00:02:00,597 --> 00:02:02,632
You want to change?

31
00:02:04,467 --> 00:02:06,503
Then change.

32
00:02:37,688 --> 00:02:39,291
How do you feel?

33
00:02:39,436 --> 00:02:42,671
Oh. I feel free.

34
00:03:02,625 --> 00:03:05,243
They found something! Come on!

35
00:03:06,218 --> 00:03:07,153
Hurry, guys.

36
00:03:22,838 --> 00:03:24,873
Risotto. Nice.

37
00:03:25,858 --> 00:03:26,803
No.

38
00:03:28,038 --> 00:03:29,500
Where did this come from?

39
00:03:31,608 --> 00:03:34,041
Locke said some kind of blast
doors trapped him in the hatch.

40
00:03:34,075 --> 00:03:37,323
Maybe it was because of this.
So no one would see who dropped it.

41
00:03:38,058 --> 00:03:40,002
Any of you guys see
a plane last night?

42
00:03:40,388 --> 00:03:44,380
Yeah, I saw it, tattoo.
Just decided not to tell.

43
00:03:44,475 --> 00:03:45,773
Hey, put that back, man.
Come on.

44
00:03:45,805 --> 00:03:46,950
Oh, man, I saw it first.

45
00:03:46,988 --> 00:03:48,690
You saw me put those in my box.

46
00:03:48,835 --> 00:03:50,200
No! Give me my stuff!

47
00:03:50,486 --> 00:03:53,453
Take it easy! You guys are like locusts.
How about a little order here?

48
00:03:53,487 --> 00:03:56,210
Shouldn't we let someone a little bit
more trustworthy take care of this?

49
00:03:56,247 --> 00:03:59,571
- Like you, baby-napper?
- No. Like Hurley.

50
00:03:59,676 --> 00:04:01,730
Why not Hurley? He's done it before.
He can do it again.

51
00:04:01,766 --> 00:04:03,421
No! No way!

52
00:04:04,968 --> 00:04:06,963
Not me! No, not again! No!

53
00:04:07,105 --> 00:04:10,171
Hey, hey, guys, guys.
How about no one's in charge, okay?

54
00:04:10,275 --> 00:04:13,312
I'm sure everyone can manage
to just take what they need.

55
00:04:13,515 --> 00:04:14,511
Great plan, moonbeam.

56
00:04:14,546 --> 00:04:18,160
After that, we can sing
"kumbaya" and do trust falls.

57
00:04:22,818 --> 00:04:24,902
We can do it any way you want.

58
00:05:10,837 --> 00:05:11,633
Hey!

59
00:05:15,705 --> 00:05:17,410
Hey! Hey!

60
00:05:45,586 --> 00:05:46,482
Uh-oh.

61
00:06:07,665 --> 00:06:08,512
Hey.

62
00:06:11,257 --> 00:06:12,821
Whatcha doin'?

63
00:06:15,396 --> 00:06:16,570
Nothin'.

64
00:06:18,027 --> 00:06:20,300
Who were you looking
for out there?

65
00:06:24,186 --> 00:06:25,420
No one.

66
00:06:25,745 --> 00:06:29,461
When you ran off, it sort of seemed
like you were looking for someone.

67
00:06:29,606 --> 00:06:31,992
- I tried to find you...
- I kinda...

68
00:06:33,297 --> 00:06:35,572
don't want to talk about it.

69
00:06:35,905 --> 00:06:37,751
Sure. Okay.

70
00:06:40,987 --> 00:06:42,730
Pretty weird, huh?

71
00:06:44,575 --> 00:06:46,570
You said the island won't
let you lose weight--

72
00:06:46,605 --> 00:06:48,842
you destroy your stash,
then bang--

73
00:06:49,728 --> 00:06:52,201
more food falls from the sky.

74
00:06:53,606 --> 00:06:55,171
How about that.

75
00:06:56,905 --> 00:06:59,042
I'm proud of you.

76
00:07:00,777 --> 00:07:04,822
- Proud of me for what?
- Not freaking out.

77
00:07:11,138 --> 00:07:12,940
How's the diet coming, Hugo?

78
00:07:17,576 --> 00:07:19,043
Ah, it's okay.

79
00:07:20,397 --> 00:07:23,591
I had a salad and some
chicken breast for lunch.

80
00:07:23,685 --> 00:07:27,493
That's great.
It gets easier, I promise.

81
00:07:27,917 --> 00:07:32,393
So, I heard you had a visit
with your mom. How did that go?

82
00:07:33,388 --> 00:07:34,510
Good.

83
00:07:34,657 --> 00:07:36,271
You're not still
mad at her, then?

84
00:07:36,307 --> 00:07:40,213
Nah. I know she put me
in here for a reason.

85
00:07:40,316 --> 00:07:42,250
What reason is that?

86
00:07:45,256 --> 00:07:47,011
The accident.

87
00:07:48,766 --> 00:07:50,901
You want to talk
about that today?

88
00:07:52,125 --> 00:07:53,592
Do we have to?

89
00:07:53,837 --> 00:07:56,182
Hugo, you've been in here
almost two months now.

90
00:07:56,217 --> 00:08:00,301
Don't you think it's time to start
getting our hands dirty? Hmm?

91
00:08:02,737 --> 00:08:04,960
Okay, why don't we,
uh, talk about the--

92
00:08:05,066 --> 00:08:07,630
the homework assignment
that I gave you?

93
00:08:08,526 --> 00:08:10,561
I was never really
good at homework.

94
00:08:10,795 --> 00:08:12,621
You remember what you
were supposed to do?

95
00:08:12,655 --> 00:08:16,261
Just make a list of things
that you like about yourself?

96
00:08:16,546 --> 00:08:17,922
Nobody else did it.

97
00:08:18,066 --> 00:08:20,203
Nobody else? Meaning?

98
00:08:20,295 --> 00:08:24,483
Well, dave didn't do it.
He said it was a stupid idea.

99
00:08:24,627 --> 00:08:28,050
Well, you know,
I'm not Dave's doctor, but

100
00:08:28,337 --> 00:08:32,290
we have talked about how he can
be a very negative influence.

101
00:08:32,858 --> 00:08:36,041
Dave's the most normal
person in this place, man.

102
00:08:36,326 --> 00:08:38,843
But he doesn't want you to change,
does he?

103
00:08:42,356 --> 00:08:44,551
Come on, give me the ball!
Give me the ball!

104
00:08:45,887 --> 00:08:48,602
Dude, dude!
I'm open! Dude, dude!

105
00:08:49,538 --> 00:08:52,491
It's called "dribbling."
Not "drooling," "dribbling."

106
00:08:53,238 --> 00:08:55,422
Well, shoot it, then! Shoot it!

107
00:08:55,518 --> 00:08:58,291
What-- oh, high percentage shot.
Excellent choice.

108
00:09:00,148 --> 00:09:01,861
You want in the game, man?

109
00:09:01,998 --> 00:09:04,521
Go for it.
Something tells me no one will care.

110
00:09:07,005 --> 00:09:08,701
What's the matter with you?

111
00:09:09,508 --> 00:09:10,592
Nothin'.

112
00:09:13,358 --> 00:09:15,533
Dude, dude, give up the rock!

113
00:09:17,375 --> 00:09:21,840
Fantastic. Give it to the guy
who's not even in the game!

114
00:09:22,826 --> 00:09:26,630
Hey, it's taco night, dude.
Let's blow this pop stand.

115
00:09:28,005 --> 00:09:29,372
What?

116
00:09:29,747 --> 00:09:33,032
Brooks said...
you're, like, negative.

117
00:09:33,128 --> 00:09:34,403
Well, duh!

118
00:09:35,157 --> 00:09:37,953
So, what, you don't want to
hang out with me anymore?

119
00:09:38,056 --> 00:09:39,340
No, I don't know. It's just--

120
00:09:39,378 --> 00:09:42,423
is that quack getting inside your head,
man? Do not let him!

121
00:09:42,517 --> 00:09:44,851
You got much more important
things to think about.

122
00:09:44,887 --> 00:09:45,883
Like what?

123
00:09:46,307 --> 00:09:48,631
Like hard or soft shell, baby?

124
00:09:48,777 --> 00:09:51,833
Chicken or shrimp?
Sour cream or hot sauce?

125
00:09:54,016 --> 00:09:55,352
Yeah, I guess I could eat.

126
00:09:55,535 --> 00:09:58,863
Yeah, I thought so.
Noche de tacos, amigo.

127
00:10:07,337 --> 00:10:10,192
Good. Now,
can you do the other one?

128
00:10:15,627 --> 00:10:16,600
Is it broken?

129
00:10:16,765 --> 00:10:20,082
Without an x-ray, you're gonna
have to do with my best guess.

130
00:10:21,815 --> 00:10:22,802
Sorry.

131
00:10:26,646 --> 00:10:27,820
How you holding up?

132
00:10:27,937 --> 00:10:30,060
Depends on Jack's best guess.

133
00:10:30,347 --> 00:10:33,671
There's a small fracture,
probably a hairline.

134
00:10:34,146 --> 00:10:36,821
This will keep the swelling down
until I can get the splint on it.

135
00:10:36,855 --> 00:10:38,450
How long until I
can walk on it?

136
00:10:38,515 --> 00:10:40,993
You're gonna have to keep
off it a couple of weeks.

137
00:10:41,105 --> 00:10:42,661
There's a wheelchair
back at camp--

138
00:10:42,696 --> 00:10:43,441
No!

139
00:10:44,106 --> 00:10:45,471
I don't need a wheelchair.

140
00:10:45,616 --> 00:10:49,422
We took a pair of crutches from the
fuselage when we moved down the beach.

141
00:10:51,065 --> 00:10:51,583
Okay.

142
00:10:53,125 --> 00:10:55,312
Be back in a while.

143
00:10:57,886 --> 00:10:59,680
He could've escaped.

144
00:11:00,013 --> 00:11:02,204
- Sorry?
- Henry.

145
00:11:03,476 --> 00:11:05,793
During the lockdown.
I was hurt.

146
00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:08,435
He could have escaped...

147
00:11:09,549 --> 00:11:13,110
but he-- he came back to help me.
Why would he do that?

148
00:11:13,225 --> 00:11:15,393
He didn't come back
to help you, John.

149
00:11:15,486 --> 00:11:18,673
He came back because he thought
his story was gonna check out.

150
00:11:24,086 --> 00:11:26,512
He was dead already.

151
00:11:28,958 --> 00:11:32,901
Four months ago,
I was part of the search party.

152
00:11:32,996 --> 00:11:37,921
Henry Gale was hanging out
of the basket, neck broken.

153
00:11:39,136 --> 00:11:41,351
So he was already dead.

154
00:11:42,248 --> 00:11:43,600
Yes.

155
00:11:43,677 --> 00:11:46,242
And then you buried him
and left a grave marker.

156
00:11:46,666 --> 00:11:47,562
Yes.

157
00:11:49,108 --> 00:11:52,530
You really should have checked
his wallet before you did that.

158
00:11:55,158 --> 00:11:59,581
I assume Henry Gale did not have any
paper on which to compose his thoughts.

159
00:11:59,725 --> 00:12:01,532
So he had to improvise.

160
00:12:01,867 --> 00:12:04,142
There wasn't much
space for that.

161
00:12:05,917 --> 00:12:07,370
"Jennifer...

162
00:12:08,306 --> 00:12:09,631
Well, you were right.

163
00:12:09,828 --> 00:12:13,961
Crossing the Pacific isn't easy.
I owe you a beer.

164
00:12:14,166 --> 00:12:17,872
I'm hiking to one of the
beaches to start a signal fire.

165
00:12:18,016 --> 00:12:22,010
But if you're reading this,
I guess I didn't make it.

166
00:12:22,487 --> 00:12:24,952
I'm sorry. I love you, Jenny.

167
00:12:25,096 --> 00:12:28,011
Always have, always will.

168
00:12:29,545 --> 00:12:32,453
Yours, Henry."

169
00:12:34,417 --> 00:12:35,933
So, tell me...

170
00:12:37,236 --> 00:12:41,493
how did Henry Gale write a note
to his wife with a broken neck?

171
00:12:44,945 --> 00:12:49,372
Wasn't me. I didn't kill him.
You don't understand--

172
00:12:49,466 --> 00:12:52,472
How did you know his wife's name?
Did you interrogate him?

173
00:12:52,798 --> 00:12:54,842
Please, just listen.
I'm just a--

174
00:12:54,948 --> 00:12:56,740
How many of you are there?

175
00:12:57,068 --> 00:13:00,780
If I told you about them,
you have no idea what he'll do.

176
00:13:01,065 --> 00:13:01,880
He?

177
00:13:02,808 --> 00:13:06,083
You mean their leader?
The guy with the beard?

178
00:13:06,188 --> 00:13:09,940
Him?! He's no one. Nothing!

179
00:13:10,096 --> 00:13:11,363
Where are your people?

180
00:13:11,505 --> 00:13:13,320
- I can't...
- How many of you are there?

181
00:13:13,355 --> 00:13:15,690
- You don't understand!
- Understand this.

182
00:13:16,106 --> 00:13:17,353
Hey.

183
00:13:17,578 --> 00:13:19,900
You have three seconds
to answer my question.

184
00:13:20,185 --> 00:13:23,273
How many of you are there? One.

185
00:13:23,375 --> 00:13:24,971
- He'll kill me!
- I'll kill you!

186
00:13:25,877 --> 00:13:27,242
- Two.
- Sayid!

187
00:13:27,348 --> 00:13:30,482
You can't do this!
I am not a bad person!

188
00:13:30,625 --> 00:13:31,572
Three.

189
00:13:33,355 --> 00:13:35,692
What the hell's wrong with you?

190
00:13:35,917 --> 00:13:37,712
What's going on?!
I heard a gunshot!

191
00:13:37,755 --> 00:13:39,502
- What happened?
- He's a liar!

192
00:13:39,638 --> 00:13:42,251
It's fine.
Just get him out of here.

193
00:13:42,597 --> 00:13:43,332
Jack!

194
00:13:46,336 --> 00:13:46,940
Jack!

195
00:13:51,307 --> 00:13:54,103
- Jack!
- I've got it covered, John.

196
00:13:58,908 --> 00:13:59,870
Thank you.

197
00:14:00,255 --> 00:14:01,481
Shut up.

198
00:14:15,337 --> 00:14:15,952
Hey.

199
00:14:17,305 --> 00:14:19,203
I noticed you were
building something.

200
00:14:19,667 --> 00:14:24,103
I thought maybe you could
use this for whatever it is.

201
00:14:24,578 --> 00:14:27,421
That is very thoughtful
of you, Charlie.

202
00:14:32,808 --> 00:14:34,512
Why don't you help me?

203
00:14:36,006 --> 00:14:37,373
What are you making?

204
00:14:39,065 --> 00:14:40,870
Hold that end.

205
00:14:45,028 --> 00:14:46,680
Is it a Starbucks?

206
00:14:51,278 --> 00:14:53,801
Help me carry one of
those loads, please.

207
00:14:53,955 --> 00:14:55,353
You gonna tell me?

208
00:14:58,676 --> 00:15:00,383
Not right now.

209
00:15:55,488 --> 00:15:56,901
You're not here!

210
00:16:15,458 --> 00:16:18,003
Hey! Wait!

211
00:16:19,275 --> 00:16:20,251
Wait!

212
00:16:21,285 --> 00:16:23,081
Wait! Dave!

213
00:16:39,658 --> 00:16:41,170
You okay, Hurley?

214
00:16:44,635 --> 00:16:47,560
Did either of you see
a guy run through here?

215
00:16:47,727 --> 00:16:48,900
In a bathrobe?

216
00:16:51,485 --> 00:16:53,282
With a coconut?

217
00:16:54,416 --> 00:16:58,992
No. Saw a polar bear on
rollerblades with a mango.

218
00:17:00,717 --> 00:17:03,051
I did not see anything, Hurley.

219
00:17:03,847 --> 00:17:06,460
Yeah. Me neither.

220
00:17:11,165 --> 00:17:14,832
- 4. 8. 15 .16. 23. 42.
- Oh, dude.

221
00:17:15,767 --> 00:17:18,053
Pretty sneaky, Leonard.

222
00:17:20,576 --> 00:17:24,580
You're using those magic numbers of
yours as a psych-out, aren't you, man?

223
00:17:25,768 --> 00:17:27,473
Oh, yeah, that's right.
You just play dumb.

224
00:17:27,505 --> 00:17:30,510
- I'm on to your juju, man.
- They're just numbers, dude.

225
00:17:31,868 --> 00:17:36,622
- What the hell is that?
- My midafternoon snack.

226
00:17:36,818 --> 00:17:39,941
Dude, that's celery.
Celery's not a snack.

227
00:17:41,108 --> 00:17:44,150
Leonard's got graham crackers, man.
You should snag one.

228
00:17:44,295 --> 00:17:45,812
He won't notice.

229
00:17:46,097 --> 00:17:48,382
What's he gonna do,
call you a "23"?

230
00:17:51,075 --> 00:17:54,811
Four... hike!
15, 16, 23, 42... Hike.

231
00:17:57,526 --> 00:18:00,330
Okay, Hugo, here's your meds.

232
00:18:00,617 --> 00:18:02,371
Hmm. Thank you, nurse Lazenby.

233
00:18:03,798 --> 00:18:06,363
Dude, you wanna get
out of here with me?

234
00:18:06,436 --> 00:18:08,483
Don't take the
horse tranquilizer.

235
00:18:09,518 --> 00:18:11,041
What do you mean,
get out of here?

236
00:18:11,075 --> 00:18:14,273
I mean escape, man.
Me and you, A.S.A.P.

237
00:18:14,436 --> 00:18:17,193
They're getting to you, dude.
We gotta split.

238
00:18:17,405 --> 00:18:18,250
Dr. Brooks says--

239
00:18:18,327 --> 00:18:20,682
Dr. Brooks does not
care about you, man.

240
00:18:20,785 --> 00:18:22,941
He's the one
prescribing that crap.

241
00:18:24,835 --> 00:18:28,980
- What the hell is it, anyway?
- Clonazepam.

242
00:18:29,437 --> 00:18:32,973
Hugo? Something wrong
with your meds there?

243
00:18:33,145 --> 00:18:39,972
No, uh... me and dave were just,
you know, talking about stuff.

244
00:18:40,098 --> 00:18:42,333
Right, well,
sorry to interrupt.

245
00:18:43,787 --> 00:18:45,250
Hello there, Dave.

246
00:18:45,606 --> 00:18:47,671
Hello there, Dr. Brooks.

247
00:18:47,798 --> 00:18:50,600
- And how are you today?
- Never been saner.

248
00:18:50,757 --> 00:18:52,993
I've been taking some pictures
for the bulletin board.

249
00:18:53,025 --> 00:18:56,740
I've got everyone except you two.
Uh, would you guys mind?

250
00:18:56,948 --> 00:18:58,020
Okay.

251
00:19:00,166 --> 00:19:01,491
Okay.

252
00:19:01,648 --> 00:19:04,060
Why don't you get a
little closer together?

253
00:19:04,157 --> 00:19:06,582
Are you gonna make us
look at the ducky, too?

254
00:19:07,616 --> 00:19:08,740
Say "cheese".

255
00:19:08,937 --> 00:19:11,410
- "Cheese".
- "Queso."

256
00:19:13,008 --> 00:19:14,170
Great.

257
00:19:14,468 --> 00:19:16,460
Okay, you need a little
water with that?

258
00:19:16,558 --> 00:19:18,023
Nope, I'm good.

259
00:19:18,567 --> 00:19:22,723
Okay. Well, fine. See you later, guys.
Thanks for the photo op.

260
00:19:28,428 --> 00:19:29,902
Dude...

261
00:19:30,175 --> 00:19:31,070
Dude.

262
00:19:31,495 --> 00:19:33,892
The revolution has begun, man.

263
00:19:34,016 --> 00:19:36,871
Lay low.
When the time is right, we fly.

264
00:19:48,897 --> 00:19:50,463
You gotta twist it...

265
00:19:53,088 --> 00:19:55,952
To get the frosting.
Pulling it will only break your cookie.

266
00:19:55,988 --> 00:19:59,530
Well, that's what I get for not going
to the expert in the first place.

267
00:20:00,306 --> 00:20:02,312
What can I do you for,
deep dish?

268
00:20:03,955 --> 00:20:06,603
Uh... I'm kinda
looking for something.

269
00:20:06,717 --> 00:20:08,212
Forget it. I'm done trading.

270
00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:11,121
I've got enough food now to
open a chain of mini-marts.

271
00:20:11,155 --> 00:20:13,343
Hey, you think
Sayid needs a job?

272
00:20:13,435 --> 00:20:17,183
Well, actually... I was sort
of hoping you'd do me a favor.

273
00:20:17,296 --> 00:20:19,941
Remember when I helped you
out with that tree frog...

274
00:20:20,228 --> 00:20:21,743
which you killed?

275
00:20:22,175 --> 00:20:23,870
Yeah, I remember.

276
00:20:24,578 --> 00:20:26,421
Well, I sorta...

277
00:20:26,936 --> 00:20:28,451
need some medicine.

278
00:20:29,835 --> 00:20:31,281
What do you need?

279
00:20:31,688 --> 00:20:35,221
- It's called clonazepam.
- Clonaze-what?

280
00:20:35,397 --> 00:20:36,560
What the hell's that?

281
00:20:37,725 --> 00:20:42,900
So you can calm down for...
for when... you're seeing things...

282
00:20:43,777 --> 00:20:46,962
that... aren't
supposed to be there.

283
00:20:49,086 --> 00:20:51,230
What stuff you seeing?

284
00:20:53,436 --> 00:20:56,760
I don't know...
maybe like a bald guy in a bathrobe.

285
00:20:58,916 --> 00:21:01,052
You mean like that guy there?

286
00:21:05,086 --> 00:21:06,653
Gotcha.

287
00:21:09,947 --> 00:21:11,102
You think you're funny?

288
00:21:11,228 --> 00:21:13,072
What the hell are you doing?
Get off me!

289
00:21:13,107 --> 00:21:14,442
Who the hell do
you think you are?!

290
00:21:14,477 --> 00:21:15,421
Get off me!

291
00:21:16,037 --> 00:21:17,881
Let go off me, mutton chops!

292
00:21:21,415 --> 00:21:22,582
Pork rinds!

293
00:21:22,738 --> 00:21:26,540
Babar! Jabba! Stay-puft?!

294
00:21:26,895 --> 00:21:31,141
Lardo! Kong! Deep dish!

295
00:21:30,825 --> 00:21:31,961
Get him off me!

296
00:21:32,476 --> 00:21:33,421
Get off me!

297
00:21:33,597 --> 00:21:38,713
The hell's the matter with you?!
Get off me!

298
00:21:44,376 --> 00:21:46,220
What the hell's the
matter with you?!

299
00:21:48,018 --> 00:21:49,182
You're crazy!

300
00:21:49,656 --> 00:21:50,852
I'm not crazy.

301
00:21:55,767 --> 00:21:57,573
I'm not crazy.

302
00:21:59,446 --> 00:22:02,093
So he just attacked you, huh?

303
00:22:05,136 --> 00:22:07,501
Try to contain
yourself, freckles.

304
00:22:07,577 --> 00:22:10,851
What? I'm worried.
You look like you got your ass kicked.

305
00:22:10,978 --> 00:22:13,443
Don't you got an
adventure to get to?

306
00:22:13,655 --> 00:22:18,290
I think Timmy fell down
a well over that way.

307
00:22:19,358 --> 00:22:21,732
Seriously, though, why'd he--

308
00:22:21,856 --> 00:22:25,091
I got no idea. I didn't do nothin'.
He just hulked out on me.

309
00:22:25,238 --> 00:22:26,840
For no reason at all.

310
00:22:27,108 --> 00:22:31,723
Okay. You walk off and have
yourself a nice, long giggle.

311
00:22:31,806 --> 00:22:35,231
But steer clear.
The man is crazy.

312
00:22:43,215 --> 00:22:44,320
Hurley?

313
00:22:47,045 --> 00:22:50,471
Hey. You okay?

314
00:22:50,887 --> 00:22:52,311
What happened with Sawyer?

315
00:22:52,467 --> 00:22:53,963
I don't want to talk about it.

316
00:22:54,046 --> 00:22:56,762
So... you beat him up?

317
00:22:56,856 --> 00:22:58,671
Guess you know what
happened, then.

318
00:22:58,806 --> 00:23:00,763
I'm on your side.
Whatever you tell me--

319
00:23:00,797 --> 00:23:02,792
Look, I don't want
to talk, okay?

320
00:23:10,397 --> 00:23:11,143
What?

321
00:23:11,256 --> 00:23:12,672
It's a lot of peanut butter.

322
00:23:12,816 --> 00:23:15,013
Well, I'm gonna need a lot
of protein where I'm going.

323
00:23:15,046 --> 00:23:17,333
- Where are you going?
- Back to the caves.

324
00:23:17,477 --> 00:23:20,173
No one lives there anymore,
so I won't bother anybody.

325
00:23:20,236 --> 00:23:22,532
See, I'll live alone and
be one of those guys.

326
00:23:22,547 --> 00:23:23,972
You know, the crazy guys,

327
00:23:24,057 --> 00:23:27,920
with the big beard and no clothes,
who's naked and throws doody at people.

328
00:23:28,015 --> 00:23:29,491
Hurley, you don't
have to do this!

329
00:23:29,528 --> 00:23:32,622
Just leave me alone!
You can't help me.

330
00:23:33,707 --> 00:23:34,870
No one can.

331
00:24:28,558 --> 00:24:29,932
You're not here!

332
00:24:35,998 --> 00:24:37,682
You were in the hospital.

333
00:24:39,696 --> 00:24:41,031
You can't be here.

334
00:24:41,397 --> 00:24:44,342
Sorry, dude. I am here.

335
00:24:48,505 --> 00:24:51,942
"I like that I have a good
relationship with my mom.

336
00:24:52,155 --> 00:24:55,420
I like making my
grandpa Tito laugh.

337
00:24:56,448 --> 00:24:58,241
I like chicken."

338
00:25:00,407 --> 00:25:03,032
No, that last one
wasn't about you, Hugo.

339
00:25:04,007 --> 00:25:06,471
I like that I like chicken?

340
00:25:07,507 --> 00:25:10,233
So, uh, tell me...

341
00:25:10,316 --> 00:25:13,482
how did it feel, writing that?
Was that difficult?

342
00:25:13,566 --> 00:25:16,053
Kinda. I think I messed
up some spelling.

343
00:25:16,155 --> 00:25:18,800
Well, I notice you didn't say
anything about the way you look.

344
00:25:18,837 --> 00:25:22,212
Are you...
comfortable with your appearance?

345
00:25:23,455 --> 00:25:24,760
It's not like...

346
00:25:26,378 --> 00:25:29,582
I mean, I can't really do
anything about it, right?

347
00:25:40,256 --> 00:25:42,082
If I, uh...

348
00:25:44,557 --> 00:25:45,871
if I...

349
00:25:47,507 --> 00:25:49,631
wasn't so fat...

350
00:25:53,868 --> 00:25:56,762
they never would have died.

351
00:26:02,755 --> 00:26:07,761
There were 23 people on that deck.
It was built to hold eight...

352
00:26:07,907 --> 00:26:11,192
and it would have collapsed
whether you went out there or not.

353
00:26:11,337 --> 00:26:14,302
Yeah, but I did walk out there,

354
00:26:14,788 --> 00:26:16,842
and it did collapse.

355
00:26:19,868 --> 00:26:21,012
I killed them.

356
00:26:21,097 --> 00:26:24,292
- It was an accident.
- It was my fault.

357
00:26:24,675 --> 00:26:27,183
But after those people died,

358
00:26:27,276 --> 00:26:29,853
you were in a practically
catatonic state.

359
00:26:30,698 --> 00:26:35,111
You stopped talking, you stopped
going out, you stopped sleeping.

360
00:26:38,078 --> 00:26:40,603
But you never stopped eating.

361
00:26:41,258 --> 00:26:44,000
Because that's how
you punish yourself.

362
00:26:47,307 --> 00:26:49,691
Dave's right about you.

363
00:26:50,415 --> 00:26:52,661
You're nothing but a quack.

364
00:26:54,195 --> 00:26:56,441
Dave doesn't want you to lose weight,
does he?

365
00:26:56,477 --> 00:26:58,281
You know, Dave cares about me.

366
00:26:59,267 --> 00:27:00,923
He's my friend.

367
00:27:01,537 --> 00:27:06,361
Okay. Let me show
you something.

368
00:27:07,245 --> 00:27:09,192
It may upset you.

369
00:27:09,348 --> 00:27:13,481
This is the photo that I
took for the bulletin board.

370
00:27:21,678 --> 00:27:24,962
Dave isn't your friend, Hugo.

371
00:27:26,068 --> 00:27:28,810
Because dave doesn't exist.

372
00:27:44,528 --> 00:27:48,171
Psst! Hey, wake up, dude.

373
00:27:51,987 --> 00:27:55,741
Finally. You could sleep
through a damn Nascar race, man.

374
00:27:55,845 --> 00:27:58,090
Man, you're not... you're...

375
00:27:58,468 --> 00:28:00,570
you're a hallucination.

376
00:28:01,626 --> 00:28:02,332
Ow.

377
00:28:02,507 --> 00:28:04,850
Was that a hallucination?

378
00:28:04,937 --> 00:28:06,811
Maybe I just imagined
you slapped me.

379
00:28:06,938 --> 00:28:08,022
Ow! Damn it!

380
00:28:08,166 --> 00:28:09,821
We can do this all night.

381
00:28:09,997 --> 00:28:12,313
Dr. Brooks showed me a
picture from the rec room.

382
00:28:12,346 --> 00:28:15,062
My arm was around,
like, nothingness.

383
00:28:15,215 --> 00:28:18,201
Uh, Kinko's? Photoshop?

384
00:28:18,295 --> 00:28:20,593
What, do you think they really
blew up the "Death Star"?

385
00:28:20,628 --> 00:28:21,221
No.

386
00:28:21,335 --> 00:28:25,340
Then stop talking crazy, man.
Come on, we're on a clock here.

387
00:28:28,897 --> 00:28:31,432
Hey, you in or you out, dude?

388
00:28:37,108 --> 00:28:39,081
Okay, come on, come on.

389
00:28:41,677 --> 00:28:44,630
Yo, check it out.
Marcus didn't finish his lasagna.

390
00:28:44,725 --> 00:28:47,613
That is a waste, man.
One for the road?

391
00:28:54,305 --> 00:28:55,492
Shh!

392
00:28:59,157 --> 00:29:01,830
Wait for it. Wait...

393
00:29:10,327 --> 00:29:14,120
Tiptoes, big guy. Vamanos.

394
00:29:28,837 --> 00:29:30,580
Okay, man.
You got the keys, hombre.

395
00:29:30,618 --> 00:29:32,730
You took them off
Brooks' desk earlier.

396
00:29:35,008 --> 00:29:36,653
Hee hee hee hee!

397
00:29:37,838 --> 00:29:39,852
Come on, man. Open it, open it.

398
00:29:49,478 --> 00:29:54,003
Oh, oh, oh...
can you taste that?

399
00:29:55,218 --> 00:29:57,342
That is freedom, baby.

400
00:29:58,886 --> 00:30:01,392
You know what tastes even
better than freedom?

401
00:30:01,497 --> 00:30:05,361
Cheeseburgers. Ha ha ha ha!

402
00:30:16,337 --> 00:30:19,432
Come on, man!
Chili fries on me.

403
00:30:21,125 --> 00:30:23,282
I don't think I can do this.

404
00:30:25,775 --> 00:30:26,981
I'm sorry.

405
00:30:27,418 --> 00:30:29,901
Sorry? What,
are you kidding me?

406
00:30:30,055 --> 00:30:31,473
You're not real.

407
00:30:31,837 --> 00:30:34,830
You're trying to get me to run away
and get cheeseburgers because...

408
00:30:34,865 --> 00:30:36,592
I want cheeseburgers.

409
00:30:37,595 --> 00:30:39,383
Did you take those pills, man?

410
00:30:39,547 --> 00:30:41,813
No, man. I'm just not coming.

411
00:30:42,368 --> 00:30:44,583
Look, you don't want me to get better.
You don't want me to change.

412
00:30:44,617 --> 00:30:48,931
you don't need to change, man.
You are fine. You're great.

413
00:30:49,048 --> 00:30:50,220
No, I'm not.

414
00:30:52,576 --> 00:30:55,223
You just want me to stay fat.

415
00:30:55,295 --> 00:30:56,891
You don't want me
to get better.

416
00:30:57,058 --> 00:30:59,163
You wouldn't care if
I ate myself to death.

417
00:30:59,197 --> 00:31:03,583
Do not do this, man.
If you don't come with me right now,

418
00:31:03,938 --> 00:31:07,861
you will never get outta here.

419
00:31:11,656 --> 00:31:13,153
Bye, Dave.

420
00:31:34,866 --> 00:31:37,360
You wouldn't happen to have my slipper,
would you?

421
00:31:47,378 --> 00:31:48,492
Thank you.

422
00:31:51,066 --> 00:31:54,803
Oh, man!
You got peanut butter on it.

423
00:31:57,378 --> 00:31:59,051
Okay, look...

424
00:31:59,188 --> 00:32:02,990
I know you're freaking out right now,
and I'm sorry. But

425
00:32:03,558 --> 00:32:07,643
it's gonna get a little
worse before it gets better.

426
00:32:07,818 --> 00:32:11,730
- Worse?
- Yeah... kinda.

427
00:32:11,988 --> 00:32:14,082
You ready, dude?

428
00:32:17,495 --> 00:32:21,093
You remember that night you
closed that window on me?

429
00:32:21,766 --> 00:32:23,953
You remember what you
did after that night?

430
00:32:24,047 --> 00:32:24,711
Yeah.

431
00:32:26,357 --> 00:32:28,450
I realized you were imaginary.

432
00:32:28,716 --> 00:32:30,090
Mm-hmm.

433
00:32:30,355 --> 00:32:34,063
And... that was a breakthrough.

434
00:32:35,718 --> 00:32:38,292
And a little while later,
Brooks let me out

435
00:32:38,397 --> 00:32:40,960
and I went home to
live with my mom,

436
00:32:41,088 --> 00:32:44,280
and I got my job with Mr.
Cluck's back, and I got better.

437
00:32:44,445 --> 00:32:49,891
Okay, good. Great. Yeah.
Except, see, here's the thing... uh...

438
00:32:52,035 --> 00:32:54,403
None of that ever happened.

439
00:32:56,067 --> 00:32:56,912
What?

440
00:32:57,366 --> 00:33:00,161
You're still at
Santa Rosa, man.

441
00:33:00,405 --> 00:33:03,082
You never left the hospital.

442
00:33:08,498 --> 00:33:11,740
That's... not possible.

443
00:33:11,858 --> 00:33:19,743
It's hard, I know. But, I mean,
all this? You? Me? This island?

444
00:33:19,926 --> 00:33:22,793
That peanut butter--
none of it's real, man.

445
00:33:22,915 --> 00:33:24,793
None of it's happening.

446
00:33:25,167 --> 00:33:27,283
It's all in your head,
my friend.

447
00:33:28,158 --> 00:33:31,342
The second you closed that window,
your brain popped a gasket.

448
00:33:31,497 --> 00:33:33,462
You went back into your
little coma thing,

449
00:33:33,498 --> 00:33:36,240
and that's where you are
right this very second--

450
00:33:36,526 --> 00:33:40,542
in your own private Idaho,
inside Santa Rosa.

451
00:33:41,418 --> 00:33:42,360
No.

452
00:33:43,127 --> 00:33:49,483
I had... my mom...
my friend Johnny... I won the lottery!

453
00:33:49,637 --> 00:33:53,560
Whoa, wow! Awesome, dude!

454
00:33:54,328 --> 00:33:56,523
What numbers did you play?

455
00:33:59,266 --> 00:34:01,303
Leonard's numbers, right?

456
00:34:01,485 --> 00:34:03,170
From the hospital?
What a coincidence.

457
00:34:03,207 --> 00:34:06,531
You, uh...
seen him around anywhere else?

458
00:34:07,357 --> 00:34:09,381
- The hatch.
- Bingo!

459
00:34:09,668 --> 00:34:12,523
The hatch,
with a button that you gotta push

460
00:34:12,657 --> 00:34:15,063
every 108 minutes,
or the world ends.

461
00:34:15,235 --> 00:34:20,133
Oh, oh, oh, and-- and what's the
code for the button? Oh, yeah.

462
00:34:20,408 --> 00:34:22,430
The numbers.

463
00:34:25,077 --> 00:34:26,730
But I got better.

464
00:34:27,488 --> 00:34:29,482
- I changed.
- Changed?

465
00:34:29,677 --> 00:34:31,743
What, are you kidding me?
Take a look at yourself.

466
00:34:31,775 --> 00:34:34,041
You've been on a deserted
island for over two months,

467
00:34:34,077 --> 00:34:37,473
and you haven't dropped 10 pounds.
How is that even possible, man?

468
00:34:37,646 --> 00:34:39,363
I just destroyed my stash,

469
00:34:39,595 --> 00:34:41,961
and I've been exercising.
Libby says it won't happen overnight--

470
00:34:41,995 --> 00:34:44,750
Oh, right, right, Libby.
The mega-cute blonde chick

471
00:34:44,856 --> 00:34:47,253
who magically appeared from
the other side of the island.

472
00:34:47,287 --> 00:34:51,471
Oh, oh, oh, yeah. And who just
happens to have the hots... for you!

473
00:34:55,645 --> 00:34:57,683
Come on, man.
Let's take a walk.

474
00:35:02,475 --> 00:35:04,123
So this is all in my brain?

475
00:35:04,285 --> 00:35:09,300
Every rock, every tree.
Every tree frog. Even me.

476
00:35:09,385 --> 00:35:11,552
The real me,
the one they told you was imaginary--

477
00:35:11,586 --> 00:35:13,192
he went out that window, man.

478
00:35:13,358 --> 00:35:16,632
Right now he's probably bouncing
from hot chick to hot chick.

479
00:35:16,715 --> 00:35:19,483
Unlike me, who's really you,

480
00:35:19,577 --> 00:35:22,103
who's got more
important things to do.

481
00:35:22,736 --> 00:35:25,740
- So I'm making you up.
- Well, sorta.

482
00:35:25,845 --> 00:35:28,342
I'm part of your
subconscious, man.

483
00:35:28,465 --> 00:35:30,992
All the people on
this island are.

484
00:35:32,246 --> 00:35:34,200
What part of me are you?

485
00:35:35,276 --> 00:35:38,373
I'm the part of you that
wants to wake up, man.

486
00:35:40,338 --> 00:35:42,141
Follow me.

487
00:35:48,225 --> 00:35:49,800
This is it, dude.

488
00:35:51,606 --> 00:35:52,333
It?

489
00:35:52,656 --> 00:35:54,670
The big finale!

490
00:35:54,885 --> 00:35:57,130
The answer to all
your problems.

491
00:35:58,207 --> 00:36:01,001
A way for you to wake up,
snap out of it.

492
00:36:06,137 --> 00:36:07,753
I don't want to kill myself.

493
00:36:07,935 --> 00:36:10,373
Who said anything about
killing yourself, man?

494
00:36:10,507 --> 00:36:13,001
This is gonna bring
you back to life.

495
00:36:16,295 --> 00:36:18,292
The only way for
you to bust out

496
00:36:18,395 --> 00:36:23,321
is to tell your mind that you
don't believe any of this.

497
00:36:24,205 --> 00:36:27,840
So... if I...

498
00:36:30,496 --> 00:36:32,450
all this'll be gone?

499
00:36:32,625 --> 00:36:35,770
- I'll just wake up?
- That's right.

500
00:36:37,726 --> 00:36:44,041
Now when you do wake up, come find me.
I'm sure I miss you.

501
00:36:46,988 --> 00:36:49,000
See you in another
life, Hurley.

502
00:36:50,356 --> 00:36:51,662
Dave!

503
00:36:51,828 --> 00:36:52,630
Ha ha ha ha!

504
00:37:09,927 --> 00:37:11,683
Jack not back yet?

505
00:37:11,966 --> 00:37:15,763
Nope. He's telling everyone at the
beach that we've got one of them.

506
00:37:16,475 --> 00:37:20,020
Something tells me people have a lot
of questions about our houseguest.

507
00:37:20,657 --> 00:37:22,232
I want to talk to him.

508
00:37:22,418 --> 00:37:24,583
I don't think that's
on today's program.

509
00:37:25,166 --> 00:37:29,511
Well, all due respect, Ana Lucia,
but I don't care what you think.

510
00:37:31,585 --> 00:37:33,282
Five minutes.

511
00:37:35,498 --> 00:37:37,723
I earned five minutes with him.

512
00:37:57,726 --> 00:37:59,380
What's your name?

513
00:38:01,505 --> 00:38:03,073
Your real name?

514
00:38:03,667 --> 00:38:07,172
Why don't you just...
keep calling me Henry?

515
00:38:09,327 --> 00:38:11,412
You've gotten used to it.

516
00:38:15,367 --> 00:38:17,410
Did you get caught on purpose?

517
00:38:19,176 --> 00:38:22,510
You and your people have been
here for God knows how long,

518
00:38:22,605 --> 00:38:25,922
- and you got caught in a net--
- God doesn't know.

519
00:38:26,308 --> 00:38:27,830
Excuse me?

520
00:38:30,598 --> 00:38:33,830
God doesn't know how long
we've been here, John.

521
00:38:35,108 --> 00:38:39,492
He can't see this island any better
than the rest of the world can.

522
00:38:39,905 --> 00:38:42,630
May I ask you a question?

523
00:38:44,445 --> 00:38:50,091
What possible reason could I have...
for putting myself through all this?

524
00:38:50,216 --> 00:38:53,640
Maybe your people were
looking for this place.

525
00:38:53,837 --> 00:38:55,402
This place?

526
00:38:56,998 --> 00:39:01,852
This place is a joke, John.

527
00:39:02,025 --> 00:39:03,862
What are you talking about?

528
00:39:04,645 --> 00:39:06,401
I crawled through your vents,

529
00:39:06,585 --> 00:39:11,050
and I stood at your computer
as your alarm beeped.

530
00:39:11,137 --> 00:39:13,212
And you know what happened?

531
00:39:14,745 --> 00:39:18,203
The timer went all
the way down to zero.

532
00:39:18,895 --> 00:39:22,810
And then some funny red pictures
flipped up in its place.

533
00:39:22,896 --> 00:39:27,661
They looked like hieroglyphics,
but I'm no expert.

534
00:39:27,975 --> 00:39:30,091
And then things got
real interesting.

535
00:39:30,207 --> 00:39:36,373
There was a loud...
clunking and a hum like a...

536
00:39:36,877 --> 00:39:38,993
magnet-- a big magnet.

537
00:39:39,107 --> 00:39:41,550
It was really very frightening.

538
00:39:43,648 --> 00:39:46,400
And do you know
what happened next?

539
00:39:48,515 --> 00:39:50,793
Nothing happened, John.

540
00:39:51,365 --> 00:39:53,793
Nothing happened at all.

541
00:39:53,987 --> 00:39:58,242
Your timer just
flipped back to 108.

542
00:40:01,708 --> 00:40:04,100
I never entered the numbers.

543
00:40:04,335 --> 00:40:06,710
I never pressed the button.

544
00:40:13,636 --> 00:40:14,811
You're lying.

545
00:40:18,535 --> 00:40:21,093
No, I'm done lying.

546
00:40:33,085 --> 00:40:34,211
Dave!

547
00:40:36,586 --> 00:40:37,720
Who's Dave?

548
00:40:39,465 --> 00:40:42,560
- What are you doing here?
- What are you doing here?

549
00:40:43,417 --> 00:40:44,952
How'd you know where I was?

550
00:40:45,968 --> 00:40:48,073
Jin saw you while
he was fishing.

551
00:40:48,156 --> 00:40:48,940
Ha!

552
00:40:49,216 --> 00:40:51,043
Jin doesn't speak English.

553
00:40:51,128 --> 00:40:53,161
Sun was with him.
She translated.

554
00:40:53,236 --> 00:40:56,060
Hurley, what is going on?

555
00:40:56,157 --> 00:40:59,490
No! You're just the part
of me that's scared.

556
00:41:01,695 --> 00:41:03,651
You don't want me to wake up.

557
00:41:03,827 --> 00:41:06,421
Well, guess what.
I'm not scared.

558
00:41:07,567 --> 00:41:09,911
Okay. Okay, Hurley...

559
00:41:10,298 --> 00:41:13,673
You're having some sort of panic attack.
I get that.

560
00:41:15,346 --> 00:41:16,980
But this isn't like you.

561
00:41:17,097 --> 00:41:20,023
Like me? You don't know me.

562
00:41:20,947 --> 00:41:22,560
I was starting to.

563
00:41:22,755 --> 00:41:25,801
Yeah, well, did you know I'm so
fat that I killed two people?

564
00:41:26,778 --> 00:41:29,201
And that I have an
imaginary friend?

565
00:41:29,385 --> 00:41:32,191
Hurley, please.
You're gonna hurt yourself.

566
00:41:32,295 --> 00:41:35,913
No, I'm not!
Because this isn't happening.

567
00:41:36,015 --> 00:41:37,381
None of it!

568
00:41:37,465 --> 00:41:39,933
I'm just imagining it.
This isn't real life.

569
00:41:40,406 --> 00:41:41,943
Why would you say that?

570
00:41:42,545 --> 00:41:44,671
Because in real life...

571
00:41:49,016 --> 00:41:51,931
no girl like you
would ever like me.

572
00:41:55,895 --> 00:41:59,531
You remember when I said
I knew you from somewhere?

573
00:42:00,835 --> 00:42:03,951
Well, maybe it's
'cause I made you up.

574
00:42:10,486 --> 00:42:13,370
What was the man's name
who broke his leg?

575
00:42:15,598 --> 00:42:18,132
The day of the crash,
on the other side of the island?

576
00:42:18,166 --> 00:42:21,353
Eko brought a man with a
broken leg to me for help.

577
00:42:21,537 --> 00:42:23,403
What was his name?

578
00:42:24,106 --> 00:42:26,250
I... don't know.

579
00:42:26,657 --> 00:42:29,012
You don't know. You know why?

580
00:42:29,516 --> 00:42:32,463
Because it happened to me.

581
00:42:35,127 --> 00:42:38,711
His name was Donald,
and I buried him.

582
00:42:38,926 --> 00:42:41,401
I buried a lot of
people, Hurley.

583
00:42:41,595 --> 00:42:45,002
So don't tell me that
that wasn't real.

584
00:42:46,706 --> 00:42:48,821
And don't tell me...

585
00:42:48,946 --> 00:42:51,061
you made me up.

586
00:42:51,835 --> 00:42:53,950
It's insulting.

587
00:42:59,536 --> 00:43:02,112
When you saw me on the
beach this morning...

588
00:43:02,536 --> 00:43:04,530
was I holding a slipper?

589
00:43:06,587 --> 00:43:09,542
Not that I can remember, no.

590
00:43:12,397 --> 00:43:17,661
Hurley... look at me.

591
00:43:20,247 --> 00:43:23,333
I am real.

592
00:43:24,356 --> 00:43:26,163
You're real.

593
00:43:27,748 --> 00:43:30,392
The way I feel about you...

594
00:43:30,905 --> 00:43:32,261
that's real.

595
00:43:51,577 --> 00:43:53,231
And that...

596
00:43:54,186 --> 00:43:55,402
was real.

597
00:44:00,785 --> 00:44:03,381
Maybe you should do
it one more time...

598
00:44:03,775 --> 00:44:06,462
just to be sure.

599
00:44:14,887 --> 00:44:16,422
Ready to go back?

600
00:44:31,037 --> 00:44:33,232
Do you really think I can...

601
00:44:34,167 --> 00:44:36,390
you know... change?

602
00:44:37,236 --> 00:44:38,311
Yeah.

603
00:44:39,975 --> 00:44:41,683
Yeah, I do.

604
00:44:48,288 --> 00:44:50,900
Why don't you get a
little closer together?

605
00:44:54,046 --> 00:44:56,192
- Say "cheese".
- "Cheese".

606
00:44:57,418 --> 00:44:58,510
Great.

607
00:44:59,268 --> 00:45:01,463
Do you need, uh,
some water to go with that?

608
00:45:01,595 --> 00:45:04,403
- Nope, I'm good.
- Okay. Well, fine.

609
00:45:04,505 --> 00:45:06,751
See you later, guys.
Thanks for the photo op.

610
00:45:09,178 --> 00:45:11,211
Here's your pill, Libby.
