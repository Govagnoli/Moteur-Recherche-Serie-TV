00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:06,420

3
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:08,880
I found them-the others.

4
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:10,670
I saw one.

5
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:12,450
I followed himback to their camp.

6
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:18,200
They live in tents-canvas tents and-and teepees.

7
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:21,600
They eat dried fish. They're worse off than we are.

8
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,120
they have a hatch.

9
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:30,680
They keep it guarded 24/7-

10
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:35,290
two guards,two guns,and two guns is all I saw.

11
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:36,670
Michael?

12
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:43,400
So I came back to tell you.

13
00:00:43,630 --> 00:00:45,070
Did you see walt?

14
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:46,460
No.

15
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:50,360
But I know he's there.

16
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:52,560
As soon as I getmy strength back...

17
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:56,650

00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:59,680

21
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:14,290
I was hoping I could borrowone of these guns.

22
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:16,380
Is this supposed to bea secret?

23
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:18,180
Jack's asleep.

24
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:21,020

00:01:21,050 --> 00:01:25,110
Yeah,well,you know... just wanna stay sharp.

Hey,can I just get a coupleof these bullets?

28

and nobody isgoing to stop me,okay?

46
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:25,560
Okay,that is my right. That is a father's right.

47
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:35,920
Today

48
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,390

00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:05,880
What are you doingout here?

50
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:08,510
Nothing. Just getting some air.

51
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:11,050
Well,come on. We should talk.

52
00:04:19,730 --> 00:04:20,500
How many?

53
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:22,780
Rifles and pistols?11 total.

54
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:24,260
That's it?That's it.

55
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:26,770
In case you forgot,they tookfive of 'em right off us.

56
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:28,500
How long would it take usto get to their camp?

57
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:32,200
We leave now and move fast-middle of the night tomorrow.

58
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:34,640
Look,they have no ideaI know where they are.

59
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:38,040
They won't be expecting us. So we get the guns and we go,

60
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:40,870
right now,just the five of us. No,no,five's not enough.

61
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:43,120
You said there's at least 20of them. They've got our guns,

62
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:44,960
and we're not even sure if what you saw was-

63
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:47,290
hey,I know what I saw!

64
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:49,470
We take too many people,they'll hear us coming.

65
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:51,650
I'm not taking a damn armyacross the island,jack.

66
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,350
Michael,you sureyou're in the best place

67
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:55,060
to be making decisions for all of us right now?

68
00:04:55,090 --> 00:04:57,120
You got a son,jack?

69
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:58,890
They're dead!

70
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:06,380
Ana lucia and libby are dead.

71
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:10,320
I mean,we haven't evenburied 'em yet.

72
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:20,160

His friends are right behind us.

91
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:47,800
today

92
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:00,480
Hello.

93
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:04,250
I didn't hear you come in,man.

94
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:06,420
I left my shoes outside.

95
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:08,480
They were muddy.

96
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:12,480
Did you find him?

97
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,390
No.

98
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:26,670
I hear you're a priest.

99
00:08:27,370 --> 00:08:29,170
Yes.

100
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:32,710
Guess you believe in hell,then.

101
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:40,710
For a brief time I served in a small parish in england.

102
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:43,480
Every sunday after mass,

103
00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:47,930
I would see young boy waiting at the back of the church,

104
00:08:48,010 --> 00:08:49,920
and then one day the boy confessed to me

105
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:54,660
that he had beaten his dog to death with a shovel.

106
00:08:57,670 --> 00:09:02,400
He said the dog had bitten his baby sister on the cheek,

107
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:05,580
and he needed to protect her.

108
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:11,410
And he wanted to know whether he would go to hell for this.

109
00:09:11,690 --> 00:09:15,620
I told him that god would understand,

110
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:18,400
that he would be forgiven...

111
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:22,110
as long as he was sorry.

112
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,690
But the boy did not care about forgiveness

113
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:32,330
He was only afraid that if he did go to hell...

114
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:37,350
that dog would be there waiting for him.

115
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,210
hey.

116
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:11,700
You all right?

117
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,120
Yeah.

118
00:10:15,270 --> 00:10:17,260
I was coming backto check on you.

119
00:10:17,290 --> 00:10:18,480
Yeah,man.

120
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:20,360
I had to get out of there.

121
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:22,740
Just...

122
00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:26,120
I have to get my son back.

123
00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:28,800
We're gonna help youdo that,michael.

124
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:31,010
It's gotta be the wayI said,man.

125
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,380
Just the five of us.

126
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:35,390
Otherwise,it won't work. It won't work.

127
00:10:35,410 --> 00:10:36,740
I promise,we're gonnafigure that out.

128
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:39,030
I have a way to figured it out.

129
00:10:39,050 --> 00:10:41,280
It's gotta be just the peoplewho already know-

130
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:44,290
you,me,kate,sawyer,hurley. That's it.

131
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:48,410
anybody else...it put me more danger

132
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:51,080
you'll get aside of this

133
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:55,210
It's my son!It's my call.

134
00:10:55,610 --> 00:10:58,520
And that's the wayit has to be.

135
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:07,680
Then that's the wayit'll be.

136
00:11:21,170 --> 00:11:22,490
hey.

137
00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:25,260
Hey,aaron.

138
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:27,280
Hey,big guy.

139
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:29,570
Hi!

140
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,260
Have you seen eko?

141
00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:34,900
No.

142
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:41,020
You know,we're building a church.

143
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:45,050
Is there somethingyou want,charlie?

144
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:48,450
Yeah.

145
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:51,570
I found somethingin the pallet

146
00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:53,840
I thought you might need.

147
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,580
Vaccine?

148
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:00,990
I don't know whatwe'd need vaccine for,

149
00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:03,390
but I figured if anyoneshould have it,

150
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:05,400
you and the baby should.

151
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:07,030
It's all right. It's A...

152
00:12:07,050 --> 00:12:09,570
it's a pneumatic injector.

153
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,210
You just,uh...

154
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:13,090
you put it into your leg,and...

155
00:12:13,810 --> 00:12:14,900
it goes right in.

156
00:12:14,930 --> 00:12:17,040
Quite painless,really.

157
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:19,750
You seem to knowa lot about it.

158
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:21,460
I tried it

159
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:26,000
I want to make sure xxx before giving itto you and the baby.

160
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:28,460
Well,how do you feel?I mean,did it do anything?

161
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,170
Did it-what did it-what didt do?

162
00:12:30,190 --> 00:12:31,930
I don't know. I feel fine.

163
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:34,280
Anyway,it says

164
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:37,730
you're supposed to give yourselfa shot every nine days.

165
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:39,720
All right? So I mean,there's enough here

166
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:42,450
for you and the babyfor a while.

167
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:44,320
That's it

168
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:49,630
All right.

169
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:51,750
I'll put it... yeah.

170
00:12:51,890 --> 00:12:53,140
thank you.

171
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:54,620
You're welcome.

172
00:12:54,770 --> 00:12:56,900
I should really feed him,so...

173
00:12:56,930 --> 00:12:59,050

174
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:02,110

00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:05,570
hey,lookie what I found. She was following her friends.

194
00:15:05,590 --> 00:15:07,100
About half a klick behind us.

195
00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:10,300
You make one sound...

196
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:15,270
you'll never see your boyagain.

197
00:15:16,310 --> 00:15:17,800
Gag him.

198
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:19,410
Get readywith the torches.

199
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,770
i wanna go talk to her people

200
00:15:28,930 --> 00:15:30,600
I think we better head back. What?

201
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:32,700
Just to find the trail,john. I've lost the trail.

202
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:36,060
You don't just lose a trail. You just don't wanna find him.

203
00:15:36,090 --> 00:15:37,770
Yeah,that's right,jack.

204
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:38,960
I've been runningthrough the jungle

205
00:15:38,990 --> 00:15:40,290
toward the sun of gunfire

206
00:15:40,310 --> 00:15:41,820
because I don't careabout michael.

207
00:15:41,830 --> 00:15:44,660
You know what happens ifwe just turn around and go back?

208
00:15:44,690 --> 00:15:48,450
We're never gonna see him again,and that's gonna be on us,

209
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:51,470
on you and on me.

210
00:15:51,510 --> 00:15:54,410
You're exactly right,jack.

211
00:15:56,590 --> 00:15:57,600
Who are you?

212
00:15:57,630 --> 00:15:59,850
He's the son of a bitchthat shot me on the raft.

213
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:02,440
Why don't you pointthe gun down?

214
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:09,430
It's okay. He's just delivering a message.

215
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:13,170
He has to scare your friendsto do it.

216
00:16:13,850 --> 00:16:15,360
I don't believe you

217
00:16:15,390 --> 00:16:16,840
You don't believe what?

218
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:19,270
I think there's more of usthan there are of you.

219
00:16:19,290 --> 00:16:21,840
That'san interesting theory.

220
00:16:22,030 --> 00:16:24,450
Light 'em up!

221
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:31,750
Give me your weapon. Turn around. Go home.

222
00:16:31,770 --> 00:16:33,400
No.

223
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:37,440
I hoped it wouldn'tcome to this.

224
00:16:37,490 --> 00:16:39,580
Bring her out,alex!

225
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:43,200

226
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:45,290

00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:08,590

232
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:13,450

233
00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:25,820

234
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:47,570

00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:01,250

242
00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:45,800
So what happened out therein the jungle?

243
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:48,130
Exactly what he said happened. He found the camp-

244
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:52,210
I ain't talking about mike. You and freckles...

245
00:18:53,210 --> 00:18:56,460
before you found him. Y'all were gone all night.

246
00:18:56,810 --> 00:18:58,950
We were caught in a net.

247
00:18:59,890 --> 00:19:01,590
What the hell's that supposed to mean?

248
00:19:01,610 --> 00:19:05,520
It means we got caughtin a net.

249
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:08,820
that what they'recalling it these days?

250
00:19:11,490 --> 00:19:14,430

251
00:19:14,950 --> 00:19:15,820
Yeah.

252
00:19:15,850 --> 00:19:16,850
Who's going after him?

253
00:19:16,870 --> 00:19:18,580
Locke and eko went outin the middle of the night.

254
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:20,550
But we ain't seeneither of 'em since.

266
00:19:47,970 --> 00:19:52,830
It is not his call,jack. It's ours.

Why are you asking meall these questions?

335
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:26,340
Did walt ever appearin a place he wasn't supposed to be?

336
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:33,140
You say he was halfwayaround the world,but...

For someone who wantshis son back so badly...

341
00:25:48,970 --> 00:25:53,020

There's been a developmentsince you came here,michael.

417
00:34:31,570 --> 00:34:34,190

00:34:34,220 --> 00:34:35,670
So go get him back.

419
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:37,980
We can't do that.

420
00:34:38,830 --> 00:34:41,090
BUT YOU CAN.

421
00:34:45,210 --> 00:34:47,190

Let him go! Get your hands off him right now!Dad,don't!

434
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:45,830

they hurt you?

436
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:54,950
THEY MAKE ME TAKE TESTS.

437
00:35:54,990 --> 00:35:55,800
They make you what?!

438
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:58,460
We're not gonna talk about that.

439
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:01,690
How's vincent?

440
00:36:01,820 --> 00:36:05,350
Vincent'S... he's great.

441
00:36:05,380 --> 00:36:07,800
He's great. He misses you.

442
00:36:08,030 --> 00:36:09,830
Hey,don't be scared,man.

443
00:36:09,860 --> 00:36:10,960
Don't be scared.

444
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:12,650
It's gonna be over real soon,okay?

445
00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:14,300
I'm gonna get you out of here,okay?

446
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:15,640
They're not who they say they are... walt!

447
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:16,220
They're pretending!

448
00:36:16,250 --> 00:36:17,560
Do you want me to put youin the room again?

449
00:36:17,590 --> 00:36:19,680
Pretending?Pretending what?!

450
00:36:19,710 --> 00:36:20,770
Okay,that's it. We're done.

451
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,500
No,no,no,no,wait. Hey,wait,wait,wait,wait!

00:36:22,530 --> 00:36:24,470

00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:25,680
Come here!Dad.

454
00:36:25,710 --> 00:36:29,980
Don't leave me. Help me,please. Don't leave me.

455
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,450

456
00:36:32,470 --> 00:36:33,280

457
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:35,130

458
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:38,510

459
00:36:38,540 --> 00:36:41,180
WALT, I'M GONNA GET YOU

460
00:36:41,210 --> 00:36:43,470
I love you,too,walt!Put me down! Let me go!

461
00:36:43,470 --> 00:36:45,970
I'm gonna get you outta here!Dad!

462
00:37:06,030 --> 00:37:08,400
after you release our man,

463
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:11,520
I'm gonna need youto do something else.

464
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:18,970
whatever you want.

465
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:24,860
I'm writing four names down-four of your friends.

466
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:27,810
We need youto bring them here.

467
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:33,990
You have to bring onlythese four people,michael,

468
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:36,060
just them.

469
00:37:37,430 --> 00:37:42,100
If you don't bringall the people on the list...

470
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:48,090
you'llnever see walt again.

471
00:37:48,230 --> 00:37:51,020
yeah. Okay.

472
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:57,000
Do you understand,michael?

473
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:00,970
WHAT DO I TELL THEM?

474
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,020
IT DOESN'T MATTER.

475
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:05,360
Make up a story.

476
00:38:06,460 --> 00:38:10,460
They'll be angry enough to believewhatever you say.

477
00:38:15,830 --> 00:38:18,560
Who's james ford?

478
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:20,500
You know him as "sawyer. "

479
00:38:20,530 --> 00:38:22,960
You know the rest of them?

480
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:25,140
Yeah.

481
00:38:30,070 --> 00:38:32,230
I know them.

482
00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:37,450
IF I DO ALL THIS...

483
00:38:38,060 --> 00:38:40,370
<i>IF I DO WHAT YOU SAY...</i>

484
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:42,780
YOLL GET YOUR SON BACK.

485
00:38:44,450 --> 00:38:46,990
YOU'LL BOTH GO FREE.

486
00:38:54,980 --> 00:38:56,760
And I want the boat.

487
00:40:14,220 --> 00:40:18,920
When the plane crashed,I was on my way to los angeles to bury my dad.

488
00:40:18,950 --> 00:40:21,080
I'm sorryto hear that.

489
00:40:21,770 --> 00:40:24,860
It seems like sucha long time ago now.

490
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:28,810
I was gonna goright from the airport to the cemetery,but...

491
00:40:29,110 --> 00:40:32,060
I had no ideawhat I was gonna say.

492
00:40:34,410 --> 00:40:36,650
Here we are again.

493
00:40:40,490 --> 00:40:43,660
I think michaelhas been compromised.

494
00:40:44,110 --> 00:40:46,590
Let's keep walking,jack.

495
00:40:47,610 --> 00:40:48,310
What do you mean,compromised-

496
00:40:48,340 --> 00:40:52,110
his actions are not those of a man who is telling the truth.

497
00:40:52,580 --> 00:40:54,030
Why would he lie to us?

498
00:40:54,060 --> 00:40:57,260
Because I believe a fatherwould do anything for his son,

499
00:40:57,290 --> 00:40:59,730
because I believe that michaelmay have freed henry,

500
00:40:59,750 --> 00:41:02,520
and because I believehe's leading you into a trap.

501
00:41:02,540 --> 00:41:04,180
You believe a lot,sayid.

502
00:41:04,210 --> 00:41:07,780
And I also believethat henry was one of them.

503
00:41:13,910 --> 00:41:15,250
All right. Let's go talk to him.

504
00:41:15,260 --> 00:41:18,380
No,he must continueto believe he's in control.

505
00:41:18,410 --> 00:41:19,790
Why the hellwould we want to do that?

506
00:41:19,820 --> 00:41:23,360
So we can createan advantage.

507
00:41:26,430 --> 00:41:27,590
How?

508
00:41:27,630 --> 00:41:29,830
I don't know yet.

509
00:41:29,940 --> 00:41:33,390
But we have one more nightto figure that out.

510
00:41:37,260 --> 00:41:40,250
Ana lucia cortez was...

511
00:41:41,820 --> 00:41:46,300
before we crashed,she was a police officer.

512
00:41:46,620 --> 00:41:49,250
I don't think it was easyfor her being here,

513
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:52,260
but I think she didthe best she could.

514
00:41:53,510 --> 00:41:54,790
She was a woman of few words,

515
00:41:54,820 --> 00:41:59,050
and I'm gonna followher example.

516
00:42:00,980 --> 00:42:03,560
Rest in peace,ana.

517
00:42:16,670 --> 00:42:19,080
libby was...

518
00:42:22,290 --> 00:42:24,150
she was...

519
00:42:28,940 --> 00:42:31,810
libby was a psychologist.

520
00:42:33,940 --> 00:42:37,340
Or... psychiatrist.

521
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:41,320
One of those.

522
00:42:41,410 --> 00:42:44,850
By the way,she probably helpeda lot of people.

523
00:42:46,860 --> 00:42:48,760
she helped me

524
00:42:51,010 --> 00:42:52,690
She was my friend.

525
00:42:54,590 --> 00:42:58,260
It's not fair that thishappened to her. It's not.

526
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:08,770
I'm going with you.

527
00:43:17,810 --> 00:43:19,520
Good-bye,libby.

528
00:43:48,820 --> 00:43:50,310
Boat!

529
00:43:53,170 --> 00:43:54,690
Boat!
