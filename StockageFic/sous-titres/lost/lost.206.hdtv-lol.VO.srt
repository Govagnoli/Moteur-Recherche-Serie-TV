1
00:00:00,867 --> 00:00:02,289
Previously on "Lost"...

2
00:00:02,523 --> 00:00:03,945
Boone, what do you see?

3
00:00:29,516 --> 00:00:31,466
All right, all of you, get up.

4
00:00:31,978 --> 00:00:33,257
We're moving out.

5
00:00:36,858 --> 00:00:38,091
Moving out where?

6
00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:39,843
Back to where you came from.

7
00:00:44,397 --> 00:00:46,345
Your buddy ran off
into the jungle.

8
00:00:46,391 --> 00:00:47,814
Michael-- he just left.

9
00:00:51,183 --> 00:00:52,253
Walt!

10
00:00:53,094 --> 00:00:55,663
What are we supposed to do,
wait for him?

11
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:58,575
What are you doing?

12
00:00:58,669 --> 00:01:00,667
I'm going to help
him find his friend.

13
00:01:29,949 --> 00:01:31,656
You thirsty, dog?

14
00:01:32,264 --> 00:01:34,738
Yeah, you're always thirsty,
aren't you?

15
00:01:36,562 --> 00:01:37,698
So drink.

16
00:01:43,264 --> 00:01:44,066
Come on.

17
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:47,024
Gather your things.

18
00:01:48,876 --> 00:01:50,108
Where are we going?

19
00:01:51,183 --> 00:01:51,937
Sayid?

20
00:01:55,257 --> 00:01:56,507
Come on. Right over here.

21
00:01:56,675 --> 00:01:58,242
Where are we going?

22
00:02:11,761 --> 00:02:13,040
What do you think?

23
00:02:15,097 --> 00:02:16,377
Does it have an inside?

24
00:02:35,598 --> 00:02:36,739
When did you do this?

25
00:02:38,184 --> 00:02:39,369
It's all yours.

26
00:02:41,332 --> 00:02:42,305
Thank you.

27
00:02:44,832 --> 00:02:45,882
You're quite welcome.

28
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,600
I'm sorry.

29
00:03:28,921 --> 00:03:30,721
You need to carry
that all the time?

30
00:03:31,982 --> 00:03:35,031
I only carry it because I
have someone to protect.

31
00:03:56,595 --> 00:03:58,544
Ana, it's got to
be over an hour.

32
00:03:59,151 --> 00:04:01,100
Shouldn't we start
moving again?

33
00:04:02,155 --> 00:04:04,203
Let 'em rest a
little while longer.

34
00:04:04,338 --> 00:04:06,193
Yeah, but what if they come?

35
00:04:07,922 --> 00:04:09,297
She's lost.

36
00:04:10,185 --> 00:04:12,133
I am not lost.

37
00:04:12,929 --> 00:04:16,387
Then tell me, Ponce de León,
which way are we supposed to go?

38
00:04:20,361 --> 00:04:24,412
All right, then, genius.
Which way would you go?

39
00:04:24,552 --> 00:04:26,166
Hey, I'm with you--

40
00:04:27,149 --> 00:04:31,724
Sit tight and wait for Mr.
Eko to show up and guide us.

41
00:04:32,564 --> 00:04:34,942
If your friend didn't run off,

42
00:04:35,035 --> 00:04:37,465
Eko would still be here,
now wouldn't he?

43
00:04:37,554 --> 00:04:40,804
You sure didn't have any problem
leaving him behind, though, huh?

44
00:04:42,288 --> 00:04:45,144
Mike only cares about
himself and his kid.

45
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:47,565
Neither's got squat
to do with me.

46
00:04:47,658 --> 00:04:49,654
Glad you feel that way.

47
00:04:51,204 --> 00:04:53,342
Didn't expect to see you again.

48
00:05:04,505 --> 00:05:09,512
Yeah, yeah, Chewie, I know.
My arm's about to fall off.

49
00:05:13,019 --> 00:05:14,108
You okay?

50
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:16,864
Yes, but we have to go.

51
00:05:18,219 --> 00:05:19,383
I saw them.

52
00:05:19,616 --> 00:05:21,677
- What? How many were there?
- What do you mean, you saw them?

53
00:05:21,707 --> 00:05:23,558
- Did you see the kids?
- Libby.

54
00:05:25,896 --> 00:05:27,941
We need to go. Now.

55
00:05:28,924 --> 00:05:29,916
All right.

56
00:05:30,849 --> 00:05:31,748
We're moving out.

57
00:05:33,525 --> 00:05:34,279
Now!

58
00:05:55,048 --> 00:05:56,862
So does all this...

59
00:05:57,367 --> 00:06:00,176
the tent, the flowers...

60
00:06:01,959 --> 00:06:03,948
mean that we're serious now?

61
00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:06,601
Quite definitely not.

62
00:06:07,257 --> 00:06:11,160
I do this for all the girls
I meet on deserted islands.

63
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:16,280
Don't go anywhere.

64
00:06:18,441 --> 00:06:21,911
- Where are you going?
- To get some water.

65
00:06:26,492 --> 00:06:27,533
Let me.

66
00:06:37,357 --> 00:06:38,445
I'll be right back.

67
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:53,946
That was quick.

68
00:07:16,459 --> 00:07:17,358
There's nothing!

69
00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:21,260
There's no one there.

70
00:07:21,633 --> 00:07:23,859
I am telling you I saw Walt.

71
00:07:24,327 --> 00:07:26,428
- It was a dream, Shannon.
- He was here.

72
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:28,890
I saw him.
He went into the tent.

73
00:07:28,983 --> 00:07:31,520
I was only gone for a few moments.
You must have fallen asleep.

74
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:33,404
This was not a dream!

75
00:07:34,105 --> 00:07:37,420
- I saw Walt!
- Then where is he?

76
00:07:39,438 --> 00:07:40,184
Hey.

77
00:07:40,744 --> 00:07:41,640
What's going on?

78
00:07:41,735 --> 00:07:45,261
Nothing. It's just a dream.
Everything's fine.

79
00:07:52,211 --> 00:07:52,964
Shannon.

80
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:55,361
What's wrong?

81
00:07:56,202 --> 00:07:57,578
Shannon had a nightmare.

82
00:07:59,495 --> 00:08:00,823
Why is he up?

83
00:08:01,663 --> 00:08:04,042
- I woke him.
- You woke him?

84
00:08:04,134 --> 00:08:05,701
I heard screams. I got worried.

85
00:08:05,804 --> 00:08:08,381
Why, would you rather I had
left him over there alone?

86
00:08:08,411 --> 00:08:11,009
You heard screams, so you woke up
the baby and ran towards them?

87
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:13,172
It sounded like
she needed help.

88
00:08:13,309 --> 00:08:14,742
Well, he's gonna
need feeding now.

89
00:08:14,772 --> 00:08:17,390
He's gonna be up all
night and fussy all day.

90
00:08:17,811 --> 00:08:18,748
Sorry.

91
00:08:18,876 --> 00:08:22,269
All right, well, no harm done.
Give him here, then. I got him.

92
00:08:30,212 --> 00:08:31,302
It's okay.

93
00:08:32,284 --> 00:08:33,230
It's okay.

94
00:08:36,041 --> 00:08:36,835
Wait.

95
00:08:37,396 --> 00:08:38,246
Wait!

96
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:43,049
Come back with me,
and let's talk about this.

97
00:08:43,217 --> 00:08:44,408
Do you believe me?

98
00:08:48,658 --> 00:08:49,892
I know what I saw.

99
00:09:09,866 --> 00:09:11,440
Beautiful, Sophie.

100
00:09:11,526 --> 00:09:14,335
Okay, can you bring your
shoulders down for me a little?

101
00:09:14,417 --> 00:09:18,968
And stand up. Good. And finish.

102
00:09:19,061 --> 00:09:20,484
Very nice, ladies.

103
00:09:20,577 --> 00:09:22,191
Did  my papa see me?

104
00:09:26,261 --> 00:09:27,352
I think so.

105
00:09:29,875 --> 00:09:36,222
Wonderful.  All right. Thank you
for a great class today, ladies.

106
00:09:36,669 --> 00:09:38,570
Very nice work, Gina.

107
00:09:44,972 --> 00:09:48,297
He wants me to be his au pair.
Can you believe that?

108
00:09:48,370 --> 00:09:49,698
Au pair, my ass.

109
00:09:49,837 --> 00:09:53,135
"Live in my big 'ouse,
take care of my kids."

110
00:09:53,218 --> 00:09:54,225
Next thing you know, it's...

111
00:09:54,255 --> 00:09:57,591
"Oh, I'm so sorry.
I did not know you were in ze shower."

112
00:09:57,683 --> 00:09:59,680
Oh, please! What a perv.

113
00:10:01,273 --> 00:10:02,264
Hello?

114
00:10:02,357 --> 00:10:05,173
Shannon, your father's
been in an accident.

115
00:10:05,444 --> 00:10:08,144
I'm on my way to St. Sebastian's.
I'll meet you there.

116
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,719
- Mrs. Rutherford?
- Yes?

117
00:10:12,216 --> 00:10:13,829
Why don't we talk down here?

118
00:10:17,196 --> 00:10:19,909
Doctor, my husband Adam--
how is he?

119
00:10:20,471 --> 00:10:23,471
Your husband was in a head-on
collision with an S.U.V.

120
00:10:23,571 --> 00:10:26,229
He suffered massive
internal injuries.

121
00:10:28,609 --> 00:10:31,083
He stopped breathing at
the site of the accident.

122
00:10:33,104 --> 00:10:36,142
I'm afraid we were unable
to resuscitate him.

123
00:10:36,748 --> 00:10:38,179
I'm so sorry.

124
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:44,413
- May I see him?
- Of course.

125
00:10:48,005 --> 00:10:49,867
Would your daughter
like to come?

126
00:10:49,951 --> 00:10:51,136
Stepdaughter.

127
00:10:53,007 --> 00:10:54,528
Come on, Shannon.

128
00:11:05,895 --> 00:11:07,510
How much further to their camp?

129
00:11:08,736 --> 00:11:11,107
A day, maybe more.

130
00:11:11,542 --> 00:11:12,711
Maybe less.

131
00:11:12,925 --> 00:11:15,592
Thanks for being so specific.

132
00:11:21,387 --> 00:11:22,240
Damn it!

133
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:26,068
I'm okay. I'm fine.

134
00:11:27,276 --> 00:11:29,926
You want to let me just take
a look at your shoulder?

135
00:11:30,029 --> 00:11:34,033
- What, are you a doctor?
- Clinical psychologist.

136
00:11:34,268 --> 00:11:35,498
You're a shrink.

137
00:11:36,245 --> 00:11:39,342
Maybe you ought to
talk to my shoulder.

138
00:11:40,089 --> 00:11:42,172
How did you get shot anyway?

139
00:11:42,309 --> 00:11:43,588
With a gun.

140
00:11:45,182 --> 00:11:47,745
He got shot when
they took my kid.

141
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:55,491
It's bad, right?

142
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,395
Yeah, it's bad.

143
00:11:58,754 --> 00:12:00,975
But it's not real bad.

144
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:03,925
Come on. You're gonna be okay.

145
00:12:04,069 --> 00:12:05,247
Let's go.

146
00:12:10,169 --> 00:12:14,306
All right. I'm fine.

147
00:12:16,928 --> 00:12:18,638
Let me give you a hand, okay?

148
00:12:23,458 --> 00:12:28,513
Tell me again why we're doing this here
when there's a dryer in the hatch?

149
00:12:28,653 --> 00:12:30,557
I don't like the hatch.

150
00:12:31,175 --> 00:12:34,211
Oh. It's 'cause of the doomsday button,
isn't it?

151
00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:37,971
Well, who needs a dryer when
we've got sun and fresh air?

152
00:12:38,254 --> 00:12:40,965
Wouldn't want to spoil ourselves,
now would we?

153
00:12:41,291 --> 00:12:43,144
Yeah, "spoil."

154
00:12:43,381 --> 00:12:44,180
Hey.

155
00:12:44,694 --> 00:12:46,520
Do you guys know
where Michael and Walt

156
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:49,250
left the stuff they didn't
take with them on the raft?

157
00:12:49,358 --> 00:12:52,123
- What kind of stuff?
- Their clothes.

158
00:12:52,401 --> 00:12:54,502
Uh, I think their stuff's
still on the beach,

159
00:12:54,532 --> 00:12:56,004
back where their tent is.

160
00:12:56,283 --> 00:12:57,520
Thanks.

161
00:13:00,604 --> 00:13:01,930
Poor thing.

162
00:13:02,725 --> 00:13:06,920
It can't be easy losing the one
person you love on the island.

163
00:13:24,299 --> 00:13:27,441
Here. Smell this.
That's his, right?

164
00:13:27,598 --> 00:13:29,325
Come on, get a good whiff.

165
00:13:29,416 --> 00:13:31,287
You're always trying to
run off and find him?

166
00:13:31,317 --> 00:13:33,696
Then find him. Find Walt!

167
00:13:37,447 --> 00:13:39,723
Good dog! Find Walt!

168
00:14:04,206 --> 00:14:07,391
I know I woke you,
and I'm so very, very sorry.

169
00:14:07,483 --> 00:14:10,292
But I mean,
staying awake for eight hours straight?

170
00:14:10,398 --> 00:14:13,052
Isn't that just cruel
and unusual punishment?

171
00:14:13,145 --> 00:14:15,015
How's that cradle treating you?

172
00:14:15,092 --> 00:14:18,140
The cradle is great.
It's the baby that's the problem.

173
00:14:19,683 --> 00:14:22,683
- What's wrong?
- He just won't sleep.

174
00:14:29,565 --> 00:14:30,741
May I?

175
00:14:31,223 --> 00:14:32,584
Sure.

176
00:14:37,224 --> 00:14:41,125
Babies like the feeling
of being constricted.

177
00:14:41,219 --> 00:14:45,174
It's not until we're older that
we develop a desire to be free.

178
00:14:47,654 --> 00:14:48,505
There.

179
00:15:00,728 --> 00:15:04,101
You know, I think everybody
knows more about my baby than me.

180
00:15:05,003 --> 00:15:05,934
Everybody?

181
00:15:07,646 --> 00:15:11,268
Charlie read me the Riot Act
last night for waking him.

182
00:15:11,515 --> 00:15:16,079
And as mad as it made me,
turns out he was right.

183
00:15:17,154 --> 00:15:20,155
You know, it's like we're
playing mom and dad to this baby,

184
00:15:20,249 --> 00:15:22,627
yet I don't remember
marrying him.

185
00:15:24,041 --> 00:15:26,981
No, seriously. I mean,
we're practically strangers, him and me.

186
00:15:27,011 --> 00:15:29,711
For all I know,
Charlie could be some religious freak.

187
00:15:29,781 --> 00:15:31,279
I seriously doubt that.

188
00:15:31,361 --> 00:15:36,084
Then why is he carrying
around a Virgin Mary statue?

189
00:15:36,176 --> 00:15:37,314
A what?

190
00:15:37,593 --> 00:15:39,542
You know,
one of the little statues.

191
00:15:39,821 --> 00:15:41,867
He says he found
it in the jungle.

192
00:15:43,394 --> 00:15:44,125
Hmm.

193
00:15:45,532 --> 00:15:46,848
How about that?

194
00:16:23,473 --> 00:16:26,663
- Death sucks, doesn't it?
- Boone!

195
00:16:28,496 --> 00:16:30,767
- Hey.
- Hey.

196
00:16:34,182 --> 00:16:36,042
I'm so sorry, Shan.

197
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:40,454
You came back.

198
00:16:52,527 --> 00:16:54,712
Where did the poster
of Marky Mark go?

199
00:16:54,861 --> 00:16:56,427
I'm 18, Boone.

200
00:17:02,593 --> 00:17:04,409
Your mom's gonna freak.

201
00:17:04,528 --> 00:17:05,332
It's a wake.

202
00:17:07,252 --> 00:17:10,945
I mean, seriously,
who doesn't serve booze at a wake?

203
00:17:12,603 --> 00:17:13,620
Scotch?

204
00:17:16,831 --> 00:17:17,770
To  your dad.

205
00:17:31,721 --> 00:17:35,308
Maybe after all this you'll
come visit me in New York?

206
00:17:37,701 --> 00:17:39,339
I won't have to visit

207
00:17:39,432 --> 00:17:43,199
if I get that job at the
Martha Graham dance company.

208
00:17:43,291 --> 00:17:45,483
I'll be living there.

209
00:17:45,759 --> 00:17:48,234
Right. The internship.

210
00:17:50,012 --> 00:17:52,869
I know it's like a 1
in 3,000 chance, but

211
00:17:53,477 --> 00:17:55,377
I might get it.

212
00:17:55,863 --> 00:17:57,172
Absolutely.

213
00:18:03,177 --> 00:18:05,399
Have you spoken to my mother?

214
00:18:07,130 --> 00:18:10,298
She's going through her thing,
and I'm going through mine.

215
00:18:11,911 --> 00:18:14,198
Have you two been
getting along?

216
00:18:16,393 --> 00:18:17,588
She hates me.

217
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:21,467
Just try to talk to her.

218
00:18:24,763 --> 00:18:28,540
From day one,
she resented my relationship with him...

219
00:18:29,558 --> 00:18:30,530
with dad.

220
00:19:05,232 --> 00:19:06,675
We need a break.

221
00:19:06,938 --> 00:19:08,141
Five minutes!

222
00:19:08,519 --> 00:19:09,297
Here.

223
00:19:23,307 --> 00:19:24,820
What are you looking at?

224
00:19:25,516 --> 00:19:26,962
We have to cut inland.

225
00:19:27,776 --> 00:19:30,162
What? Into the jungle?

226
00:19:33,339 --> 00:19:36,307
They said their people were on
the beach. If we keep walking--

227
00:19:36,337 --> 00:19:38,957
The beach curves into
a peninsula ahead.

228
00:19:40,786 --> 00:19:42,922
It may not be passable.

229
00:19:43,622 --> 00:19:44,928
"May not"?

230
00:19:47,008 --> 00:19:48,577
May not.

231
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:53,599
You're doing this to get the
cowboy back faster, aren't you?

232
00:19:54,441 --> 00:19:58,111
You would risk our
lives to help him?

233
00:19:58,672 --> 00:20:00,540
It's the only way I know.

234
00:20:03,503 --> 00:20:05,903
I liked you better when
you weren't talking.

235
00:20:12,387 --> 00:20:14,911
I can't believe
he's still asleep.

236
00:20:17,016 --> 00:20:19,184
Swaddling works every time.

237
00:20:22,525 --> 00:20:24,715
Hey, do you want to hold him?

238
00:20:28,341 --> 00:20:29,753
That's okay.

239
00:20:30,450 --> 00:20:31,787
Put your arms out.

240
00:20:37,057 --> 00:20:38,051
It's okay.

241
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:39,553
Here.

242
00:20:48,941 --> 00:20:51,549
- He smells good.
- He does, doesn't he?

243
00:20:54,507 --> 00:20:55,070
Oh!

244
00:20:57,950 --> 00:21:00,545
- Hello, Charlie.
- Hello.

245
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:04,158
Hey, John just taught me
a new trick-- swaddling.

246
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:06,864
That's excellent.

247
00:21:09,858 --> 00:21:12,458
I just came to take him so
you could have your walk.

248
00:21:17,759 --> 00:21:21,469
Well, great timing. Yeah.
I've got to get going.

249
00:21:23,315 --> 00:21:24,255
I got him.

250
00:21:29,530 --> 00:21:31,355
Well, thanks for
your help, John.

251
00:21:31,944 --> 00:21:32,750
You're welcome.

252
00:21:38,690 --> 00:21:39,668
What?

253
00:22:05,462 --> 00:22:06,350
Shh!

254
00:22:15,229 --> 00:22:17,684
I'm fine. I'm fine.

255
00:22:19,717 --> 00:22:21,761
Shh! Shut up.

256
00:22:22,321 --> 00:22:24,223
What? They can't talk at all?

257
00:22:24,362 --> 00:22:26,818
If he talks,
he's gonna get us all killed.

258
00:22:26,985 --> 00:22:29,091
By what? Them?

259
00:22:29,239 --> 00:22:30,791
I thought they lived
a day back that way.

260
00:22:30,821 --> 00:22:34,121
How about you shut your mouth and
get your buddy over here moving?

261
00:22:37,069 --> 00:22:38,745
What happened to you people?

262
00:22:44,266 --> 00:22:46,603
You want us to take
you back with us? Fine.

263
00:22:47,235 --> 00:22:49,014
But you want me to keep quiet?

264
00:22:51,446 --> 00:22:55,318
Then you need to tell
me why I have to.

265
00:23:04,776 --> 00:23:09,773
They came the first
night that we got here.

266
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:14,166
And they took three of us.

267
00:23:14,902 --> 00:23:16,995
Nothing happened for two weeks.

268
00:23:17,461 --> 00:23:21,183
Then they came back
and took nine more.

269
00:23:24,363 --> 00:23:25,764
They're smart,

270
00:23:26,862 --> 00:23:28,764
and they're animals.

271
00:23:28,910 --> 00:23:31,602
And they could be
anywhere at any time.

272
00:23:34,377 --> 00:23:36,432
Now we're moving
through the jungle--

273
00:23:36,668 --> 00:23:37,844
their jungle--

274
00:23:38,712 --> 00:23:41,712
just so that you can save your
little hick friend over here.

275
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:48,425
And if you think that one gun and
one bullet is gonna stop them,

276
00:23:49,173 --> 00:23:50,575
think again.

277
00:23:55,109 --> 00:23:58,925
So shut your mouth
and keep moving.

278
00:23:59,043 --> 00:24:00,467
They took my son.

279
00:24:03,790 --> 00:24:06,207
They took a lot of things.

280
00:24:34,609 --> 00:24:38,274
I know what it is to lose
someone you care deeply about.

281
00:24:46,584 --> 00:24:49,588
You really think that
this is all about Boone?

282
00:24:53,333 --> 00:24:56,190
I saw Walt, Sayid.

283
00:24:58,816 --> 00:25:01,668
Then why are we sitting
at Boone's grave?

284
00:25:07,847 --> 00:25:11,344
- Just go back, Sayid.
- Where are you going?

285
00:25:12,921 --> 00:25:14,054
To find him.

286
00:25:19,877 --> 00:25:20,755
It came.

287
00:25:22,307 --> 00:25:22,927
Really?

288
00:25:23,846 --> 00:25:26,810
- Oh, my god.
- Open it.

289
00:25:31,316 --> 00:25:33,627
- I can't open it.
- You what?

290
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:35,201
You open it.

291
00:25:35,365 --> 00:25:38,965
You have been waiting six months for
this letter. No way I'm opening it.

292
00:25:53,021 --> 00:25:53,919
I got it.

293
00:25:54,059 --> 00:25:55,788
- You got it?
- I got it!

294
00:25:55,909 --> 00:25:58,243
Oh, my god!
You're going to New York!

295
00:25:59,162 --> 00:26:00,382
Oh, my god!

296
00:26:01,982 --> 00:26:02,928
Hello?

297
00:26:03,496 --> 00:26:05,229
Yeah,  this is her.

298
00:26:07,479 --> 00:26:10,760
Um, that's impossible.

299
00:26:11,458 --> 00:26:13,845
Okay. Are you sure?

300
00:26:14,743 --> 00:26:16,107
Of course.

301
00:26:16,593 --> 00:26:18,495
I will certainly do that.

302
00:26:19,018 --> 00:26:20,076
Sorry.

303
00:26:23,164 --> 00:26:24,086
What?

304
00:26:25,138 --> 00:26:26,992
My rent check bounced.

305
00:26:28,494 --> 00:26:31,108
But you're, like, rich.

306
00:26:35,417 --> 00:26:37,360
I'm sorry. I would have
offered you something to drink,

307
00:26:37,390 --> 00:26:39,640
but I have to be at a
meeting in ten minutes.

308
00:26:39,986 --> 00:26:44,205
Yeah. Um...
my checks are bouncing.

309
00:26:44,386 --> 00:26:46,540
Well, that's what happens
when you make withdrawals

310
00:26:46,570 --> 00:26:48,420
and you don't make
deposits, Shannon.

311
00:26:48,562 --> 00:26:50,671
When do I get the
money dad left me?

312
00:26:53,463 --> 00:26:55,939
The money from the will?

313
00:26:56,641 --> 00:26:58,561
There was no will.

314
00:26:59,337 --> 00:27:00,574
What?

315
00:27:01,675 --> 00:27:05,634
Shannon, your father and
I had a living trust.

316
00:27:05,772 --> 00:27:07,269
Everything passed to me.

317
00:27:07,711 --> 00:27:11,398
I'm afraid there was nothing
specifically designated for you.

318
00:27:13,478 --> 00:27:15,207
Why would he do that?

319
00:27:15,432 --> 00:27:18,824
Well, maybe he just wanted
you to find your own way.

320
00:27:19,518 --> 00:27:21,683
We all have to work, Shannon.

321
00:27:21,916 --> 00:27:24,141
Most of us are
the better for it.

322
00:27:24,648 --> 00:27:28,725
I can work. I just got this
really prestigious internship,

323
00:27:28,809 --> 00:27:31,513
and I'm not gonna make
any money for awhile,

324
00:27:31,581 --> 00:27:34,300
but I'm gonna be working,
like, 16 hours a day.

325
00:27:34,443 --> 00:27:38,777
The only thing I've ever seen you do
16 hours a day straight is sleep.

326
00:27:39,571 --> 00:27:41,628
I just need to get to New York.

327
00:27:45,424 --> 00:27:49,104
I need just something--
something to get started.

328
00:27:50,998 --> 00:27:52,343
I'll pay you back.

329
00:27:52,512 --> 00:27:54,225
This week it's an internship.

330
00:27:55,086 --> 00:27:58,974
Last year it was what,
interior design?

331
00:28:00,165 --> 00:28:02,539
You'll never pay me back.

332
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:06,686
And you'll only hate
yourself even more.

333
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:09,925
I really want this, Sabrina.

334
00:28:10,939 --> 00:28:12,064
I can do this.

335
00:28:15,152 --> 00:28:17,234
I'm sorry, Shannon.

336
00:28:21,554 --> 00:28:23,152
You're on your own.

337
00:28:37,564 --> 00:28:40,908
Oh. Double sixes.
How nice for you.

338
00:28:41,087 --> 00:28:42,049
Lucky.

339
00:28:50,087 --> 00:28:52,399
I hope you didn't
get the wrong idea,

340
00:28:52,491 --> 00:28:54,112
seeing me with the baby.

341
00:28:55,537 --> 00:28:57,458
What wrong idea would that be?

342
00:28:59,043 --> 00:29:00,980
You and Claire are close, and

343
00:29:01,165 --> 00:29:03,504
you spend a lot of
time with Aaron.

344
00:29:03,829 --> 00:29:05,979
I just wouldn't want
to overstep my bounds.

345
00:29:07,885 --> 00:29:09,636
Did she tell you
we had a fight?

346
00:29:10,999 --> 00:29:13,092
She didn't say it was a fight.

347
00:29:17,636 --> 00:29:19,969
She was gonna give it up,
you know.

348
00:29:20,566 --> 00:29:21,970
For adoption.

349
00:29:23,096 --> 00:29:24,575
She tell you that?

350
00:29:24,684 --> 00:29:27,903
Yeah, when I built the cradle.

351
00:29:29,214 --> 00:29:31,073
Oh, of course.

352
00:29:31,932 --> 00:29:33,713
When you built the cradle.

353
00:29:35,301 --> 00:29:38,789
- Why do you ask?
- She's...

354
00:29:39,027 --> 00:29:42,228
She's got a bit to learn
about being a mum--

355
00:29:42,711 --> 00:29:44,476
responsibility and all.

356
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:49,442
Hmm. Now that's an
interesting thingto say

357
00:29:49,804 --> 00:29:51,934
for a heroin addict.

358
00:29:53,468 --> 00:29:56,040
Recovering addict.

359
00:29:56,471 --> 00:29:58,171
Recovering.

360
00:30:04,162 --> 00:30:05,272
It's your turn.

361
00:30:29,270 --> 00:30:30,895
Here, let me help you.

362
00:30:33,784 --> 00:30:34,496
I got him.

363
00:30:35,707 --> 00:30:37,551
I said I got him, man.
Take a break.

364
00:30:38,215 --> 00:30:38,973
Look--

365
00:30:39,228 --> 00:30:42,158
What, you suddenly
give a damn about me?

366
00:30:44,705 --> 00:30:48,143
Just leave me alone,
both of you.

367
00:30:49,213 --> 00:30:50,382
I got it.

368
00:30:53,537 --> 00:30:54,259
Hey!

369
00:30:54,549 --> 00:30:57,170
Hey! Hey, hey, hey! Hey.

370
00:30:58,337 --> 00:30:59,187
Come here.

371
00:30:59,724 --> 00:31:00,578
Come here.

372
00:31:02,544 --> 00:31:06,812
Hey. Sawyer? Hey, you okay?

373
00:31:08,595 --> 00:31:11,008
I would've left you behind.

374
00:31:11,098 --> 00:31:13,059
Shut up, man. Don't try that.

375
00:31:14,509 --> 00:31:17,156
I did leave you behind.

376
00:31:17,365 --> 00:31:21,388
Yeah, well,
good thing I ain't you.

377
00:31:29,544 --> 00:31:34,630
Hey! Uh, hey, hey!
No, no, no, no. Sawyer! Sawyer!

378
00:31:35,367 --> 00:31:37,976
Sawyer! Hey!

379
00:31:39,390 --> 00:31:40,961
Water! Water!

380
00:31:41,125 --> 00:31:42,478
- Sawyer!
- Here you go.

381
00:31:42,566 --> 00:31:44,608
Sawyer. Come on, man.

382
00:31:44,797 --> 00:31:46,369
Here. Here.

383
00:31:47,804 --> 00:31:48,678
Come on.

384
00:31:50,257 --> 00:31:51,215
Sawyer.

385
00:31:56,045 --> 00:31:57,043
What's the matter with him?

386
00:31:57,073 --> 00:32:00,192
Well, the fever--
he's got an infection. He's dehydrated.

387
00:32:00,017 --> 00:32:01,460
We gotta keep moving.

388
00:32:02,236 --> 00:32:04,281
- What?
- We gotta keep going.

389
00:32:06,012 --> 00:32:08,873
You want to stay, that's fine.
But we're rolling out.

390
00:32:09,058 --> 00:32:10,889
We can't just leave him, Ana.

391
00:32:10,957 --> 00:32:14,207
Maybe if we just rest a little while,
he'll regain consciousness.

392
00:32:14,242 --> 00:32:16,050
Rest? Here?

393
00:32:17,079 --> 00:32:20,989
Do you remember what happened to us,
what they did to us?

394
00:32:22,373 --> 00:32:23,799
You remember Goodwin?

395
00:32:29,135 --> 00:32:31,499
Ana's right.
Maybe we should just push on.

396
00:32:31,581 --> 00:32:34,098
Hey,  you know what?
I don't remember Goodwin.

397
00:32:34,258 --> 00:32:37,758
And I'm really sorry about whatever
happened to him, but I don't care.

398
00:32:39,270 --> 00:32:40,142
Mr. Eko?

399
00:32:42,147 --> 00:32:43,797
Can you help me
make a stretcher?

400
00:32:51,551 --> 00:32:56,336
Hey, Bernard, I need four sticks.
Sturdy ones about 5 feet long.

401
00:32:56,416 --> 00:32:57,428
Yeah. You got it.

402
00:32:57,608 --> 00:32:59,158
You're gonna carry your friend?

403
00:32:59,162 --> 00:33:02,007
Yeah. We're gonna carry him.

404
00:33:07,017 --> 00:33:09,138
Why are you doing
this, Shannon?

405
00:33:09,952 --> 00:33:11,752
I didn't ask you to follow me.

406
00:33:12,037 --> 00:33:14,648
No, you'd rather be out here
alone and get lost or hurt.

407
00:33:14,678 --> 00:33:16,228
I don't need your help, Sayid.

408
00:33:16,297 --> 00:33:17,969
Walt is not out here!

409
00:33:18,522 --> 00:33:20,822
You're following a labrador,
not a bloodhound,

410
00:33:20,851 --> 00:33:23,340
in an effort to find a boy who is on
a raft in the middle of the ocean!

411
00:33:23,370 --> 00:33:26,038
- He's not on the raft.
- What are you talking about?

412
00:33:27,909 --> 00:33:29,911
We found the bottle
on the beach.

413
00:33:32,061 --> 00:33:34,986
The bottle with the messages
that they brought with them?

414
00:33:38,149 --> 00:33:40,702
I know he's out here somewhere.

415
00:33:40,863 --> 00:33:42,907
I saw Walt.

416
00:33:43,776 --> 00:33:47,087
And the raft is gone,
and he is all alone.

417
00:33:52,101 --> 00:33:53,004
Shannon.

418
00:34:58,699 --> 00:34:59,396
Come on.

419
00:35:10,447 --> 00:35:11,367
Cindy?

420
00:35:12,031 --> 00:35:12,851
Okay.

421
00:35:13,315 --> 00:35:14,107
Here.

422
00:35:14,449 --> 00:35:15,429
Cindy!

423
00:35:16,444 --> 00:35:17,923
Where's Cindy?

424
00:35:19,792 --> 00:35:20,764
She was just here.

425
00:35:20,877 --> 00:35:23,108
Cindy. Cindy!

426
00:35:23,689 --> 00:35:25,708
I don't know. She was--
- Did they take her?

427
00:35:25,738 --> 00:35:26,899
How could she just be gone?

428
00:35:26,929 --> 00:35:28,237
Cindy! Cindy!

429
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:30,716
I'm going after her.

430
00:35:31,376 --> 00:35:33,697
No. We stay together.

431
00:35:33,873 --> 00:35:36,692
We split up,
we give them what they want.

432
00:35:37,153 --> 00:35:38,766
This is all your fault.

433
00:35:38,843 --> 00:35:41,093
We never should have
gone through the jungle.

434
00:35:41,552 --> 00:35:45,891
You risked our lives to save him.
He's already dead!

435
00:35:46,407 --> 00:35:48,108
This one's on you.

436
00:36:00,745 --> 00:36:02,028
What the hell is that?

437
00:36:08,993 --> 00:36:10,035
Oh, god!

438
00:36:10,776 --> 00:36:11,672
Run!

439
00:36:20,270 --> 00:36:21,808
- Hey.
- Hey.

440
00:36:39,511 --> 00:36:40,833
She said no.

441
00:36:46,594 --> 00:36:49,276
I guess she knew why
I asked for the money.

442
00:36:51,789 --> 00:36:53,989
Can I crash at your
place in New York for...

443
00:36:54,545 --> 00:36:59,213
just a little while,
until I get on my feet?

444
00:37:06,388 --> 00:37:10,918
I'm leaving New York.
She offered me a job.

445
00:37:14,492 --> 00:37:16,449
You're going to work
for your mother?

446
00:37:16,636 --> 00:37:18,731
It's a really good
job, Shannon.

447
00:37:26,028 --> 00:37:27,658
Look, this is all
I have right now,

448
00:37:27,688 --> 00:37:29,926
but my trust fund's gonna kick
in at the end of the month.

449
00:37:29,956 --> 00:37:32,923
And after that I could
absolutely keep you afloat.

450
00:37:32,952 --> 00:37:35,522
Thank you, but, um...

451
00:37:36,740 --> 00:37:39,140
I'm gonna figure out a
way to make my own money.

452
00:37:39,168 --> 00:37:41,971
But who knows when that's gonna be?
Just take it.

453
00:37:44,039 --> 00:37:45,824
What, you don't
think I can do it?

454
00:37:46,587 --> 00:37:48,458
I didn't say that.

455
00:37:48,486 --> 00:37:50,599
You believe I can,
or don't you, Boone?

456
00:37:54,855 --> 00:37:56,727
Okay, you know what?

457
00:37:57,022 --> 00:38:00,698
I really want you to just take your
money, go work for your mother.

458
00:38:00,885 --> 00:38:02,892
I don't want it.
Just take it, all right?

459
00:38:02,922 --> 00:38:05,922
- I'm trying to help you, Shannon!
- I don't want your money!

460
00:38:07,636 --> 00:38:08,345
Okay.

461
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:21,835
Shannon!

462
00:38:23,393 --> 00:38:24,373
Are you okay?

463
00:38:24,646 --> 00:38:26,256
Do not help me up!

464
00:38:32,545 --> 00:38:33,664
Let's go back.

465
00:38:40,022 --> 00:38:42,035
Why don't you believe me?

466
00:38:46,166 --> 00:38:48,861
I need you to believe in me!

467
00:38:49,037 --> 00:38:51,427
- I do believe in you.
- You don't!

468
00:38:52,192 --> 00:38:53,643
No one does.

469
00:38:55,515 --> 00:38:58,244
They think that I am
some kind of joke.

470
00:39:00,178 --> 00:39:01,912
They think I'm worthless.

471
00:39:02,292 --> 00:39:04,596
Shannon, you are not worthless.

472
00:39:05,388 --> 00:39:07,396
You say that now,

473
00:39:08,792 --> 00:39:10,311
but you don't...

474
00:39:13,809 --> 00:39:15,583
you're just gonna leave me.

475
00:39:19,641 --> 00:39:24,045
I know as soon as we get out of here,
you're just gonna leave me.

476
00:39:30,772 --> 00:39:32,409
I will never leave you.

477
00:39:37,142 --> 00:39:38,805
I love you.

478
00:39:42,590 --> 00:39:44,159
And I believe you.

479
00:39:46,798 --> 00:39:48,113
You do?

480
00:39:50,611 --> 00:39:51,779
I do.

481
00:40:26,228 --> 00:40:27,168
Shh.

482
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:32,510
Do you see him?

483
00:40:36,569 --> 00:40:37,482
Walt!

484
00:40:38,260 --> 00:40:39,016
Walt!

485
00:40:41,362 --> 00:40:42,300
Walt!

486
00:40:44,171 --> 00:40:46,010
- Walt!
- Shannon!

487
00:40:46,118 --> 00:40:48,177
Walt! Wait!

488
00:40:52,572 --> 00:40:53,437
Shannon!

489
00:40:57,071 --> 00:40:57,966
Shannon!

490
00:41:00,310 --> 00:41:01,061
Shannon!
