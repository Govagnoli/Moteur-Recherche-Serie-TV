1
00:00:00,381 --> 00:00:01,662
Previously on "Lost"...

2
00:00:01,709 --> 00:00:04,615
Right here, there's a line.

3
00:00:05,504 --> 00:00:07,358
You cross that line,

4
00:00:07,452 --> 00:00:11,601
we go from misunderstanding to...
something else.

5
00:00:11,648 --> 00:00:14,937
- What do I do?
- That button has to be pushed.

6
00:00:20,228 --> 00:00:25,190
I never entered the numbers.
I never pressed the button.

7
00:00:25,283 --> 00:00:28,764
- You're lying.
- No, I'm done lying.

8
00:00:30,027 --> 00:00:32,503
It's a parachute.

9
00:00:47,581 --> 00:00:50,678
All right.
Cereal goes on the left, Bernard.

10
00:00:53,394 --> 00:00:55,144
So this isn't
bothering you at all?

11
00:00:55,181 --> 00:00:56,606
What's "this"?

12
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:58,127
Well, this.

13
00:00:58,860 --> 00:00:59,677
This.

14
00:00:59,857 --> 00:01:02,333
Why is a bag of potato
chips gonna bother me?

15
00:01:02,381 --> 00:01:05,590
Well, aren't you remotely curious
as to where all this came from?

16
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:08,063
You're acting like we just
got back from the supermarket.

17
00:01:08,083 --> 00:01:11,909
Well, I guess I was raised
never to question my blessings.

18
00:01:12,564 --> 00:01:15,231
I was raised to
question piles of food

19
00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:18,662
with weird labels that just
fall out of the sky, Rose.

20
00:01:18,801 --> 00:01:20,718
Well, honey,
just because you're having a bad day,

21
00:01:20,748 --> 00:01:22,188
doesn't mean you have
to raise your voice.

22
00:01:22,218 --> 00:01:25,918
Bad day? I've had seven weeks of bad
days on the other side of the island,

23
00:01:25,984 --> 00:01:29,991
just trying to stay alive so I
could get back to you. But here...

24
00:01:30,505 --> 00:01:34,846
my god, Rose,
they've built a kitchen on the beach.

25
00:01:35,593 --> 00:01:37,381
They've given up.

26
00:01:37,502 --> 00:01:40,409
Given up? On what?

27
00:01:40,502 --> 00:01:42,978
On getting rescued.

28
00:02:18,908 --> 00:02:19,664
Hey.

29
00:02:20,554 --> 00:02:22,835
You gonna get that?

30
00:02:42,831 --> 00:02:45,164
When's the last time
you went in to see him?

31
00:02:45,303 --> 00:02:47,829
A couple hours ago.
He was sleeping.

32
00:02:47,929 --> 00:02:48,963
Did he eat?

33
00:02:49,478 --> 00:02:50,282
Nope.

34
00:02:51,638 --> 00:02:53,492
That's two days now.

35
00:02:53,679 --> 00:02:55,630
No food, no water...

36
00:02:55,865 --> 00:02:57,623
nothing to say.

37
00:02:58,369 --> 00:03:02,567
I don't know about you,
but I'm tired of waiting.

38
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:19,462
I hear you've lost
your appetite.

39
00:03:23,115 --> 00:03:25,304
Okay, don't talk.

40
00:03:26,662 --> 00:03:29,472
I was never that good at
bedside manner anyway.

41
00:03:30,125 --> 00:03:33,335
I'm gonna change that dressing on
your shoulder. If you try anything,

42
00:03:33,365 --> 00:03:34,600
we've got a problem.

43
00:03:49,393 --> 00:03:50,484
So, Henry...

44
00:03:52,451 --> 00:03:53,157
"Henry."

45
00:03:54,279 --> 00:03:56,579
I was thinking about
something you were saying

46
00:03:57,170 --> 00:03:59,311
before we found
out who you are.

47
00:04:00,526 --> 00:04:02,095
This is gonna sting.

48
00:04:05,187 --> 00:04:08,856
Yeah. You were saying that
if you were one of them,

49
00:04:09,839 --> 00:04:12,745
that you'd lead
us into a trap...

50
00:04:12,932 --> 00:04:14,356
capture our people...

51
00:04:15,293 --> 00:04:16,669
force a trade.

52
00:04:16,808 --> 00:04:18,186
Us, for you.

53
00:04:20,385 --> 00:04:22,335
Pretty good idea, Henry.

54
00:04:22,989 --> 00:04:24,941
And since you are one of them,

55
00:04:25,641 --> 00:04:28,453
I thought now might be
a good time to use it.

56
00:04:29,716 --> 00:04:32,616
I'm going out to the line that
we're not supposed to cross

57
00:04:32,667 --> 00:04:35,574
and telling them
that we've got you.

58
00:04:36,133 --> 00:04:39,662
And if they want you back,
it'll cost 'em.

59
00:04:43,361 --> 00:04:45,789
And when we get Walt back...

60
00:04:48,411 --> 00:04:51,269
You might just have been
worth all the trouble.

61
00:04:56,042 --> 00:04:57,704
Did you say something?

62
00:05:01,541 --> 00:05:04,114
They'll never give you Walt.

63
00:05:31,738 --> 00:05:34,505
Don't gun it.
You're digging yourself in.

64
00:05:34,687 --> 00:05:36,399
Just tap the gas lightly.

65
00:05:36,537 --> 00:05:39,487
All due respect, I have been
driving in snow my whole life.

66
00:05:39,536 --> 00:05:41,836
- You mind stepping back?
- Well, you have to rock it out.

67
00:05:41,866 --> 00:05:43,316
You're not gonna be able to--

68
00:05:48,154 --> 00:05:49,769
I'm calling triple "A".

69
00:05:49,863 --> 00:05:53,994
Why, so they can send a tow truck?
Trust me, I can do this.

70
00:05:59,658 --> 00:06:02,421
Okay. Ease on the gas.

71
00:06:03,027 --> 00:06:05,838
That's it. You're doing great.

72
00:06:08,364 --> 00:06:09,433
Almost.

73
00:06:10,535 --> 00:06:11,954
Go, go, go-- Oh!

74
00:06:15,979 --> 00:06:17,498
Are you okay?

75
00:06:18,433 --> 00:06:21,943
Oh, yeah. Sure. I'm fine.

76
00:06:22,219 --> 00:06:25,700
You know,
I would have gotten it out eventually.

77
00:06:25,792 --> 00:06:29,033
Oh, sure.
July's right around the corner.

78
00:06:31,992 --> 00:06:34,847
Well, um,
thanks for helping me.

79
00:06:34,979 --> 00:06:35,686
Sure.

80
00:06:37,229 --> 00:06:39,371
By the way, I'm Rose.

81
00:06:39,884 --> 00:06:42,742
- Oh, uh, Bernard.
- Yeah.

82
00:06:44,454 --> 00:06:47,366
- Okay.
- Oh. Okay. Yeah.

83
00:06:47,685 --> 00:06:48,640
Okay.

84
00:06:53,411 --> 00:06:57,889
- Drive safe, now, okay?
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah. You, too.

85
00:07:05,987 --> 00:07:10,856
- Um... uh, Bernard!
- Yeah?

86
00:07:12,257 --> 00:07:15,289
Can I buy you a cup of coffee?

87
00:07:17,862 --> 00:07:20,098
Uh, coffee would be nice.

88
00:07:20,612 --> 00:07:23,709
Yeah. Okay.

89
00:07:29,981 --> 00:07:34,236
I had to beat back half the group
to get these. I saved 'em for you.

90
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:38,230
No way. I'm on a new diet.
Nothing but fish and water...

91
00:07:38,369 --> 00:07:41,706
and... fish and water.

92
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:44,036
Hurley, what are
you doing right now?

93
00:07:44,175 --> 00:07:46,221
Uh... talking to your wife?

94
00:07:46,314 --> 00:07:47,794
Good.  Can you get Libby

95
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:50,083
and meet me at the edge of
the tree line in five minutes?

96
00:07:50,113 --> 00:07:51,648
Oh, and if you can
get Jin and Sun,

97
00:07:51,678 --> 00:07:54,839
Jenkins and that frogurt guy,
the guy who used to make frozen yogurt.

98
00:07:54,869 --> 00:07:55,152
Neil?

99
00:07:55,292 --> 00:07:57,768
Yeah. And Craig and
anybody else you can get.

100
00:07:57,912 --> 00:08:00,384
Bernard, what are you up to?

101
00:08:00,505 --> 00:08:01,507
I got an idea.

102
00:08:02,903 --> 00:08:06,335
Hey, Richard. Craig, Ralph, come here.
I've got a great idea.

103
00:08:09,619 --> 00:08:11,869
I'm not so sure trading
people's their thing.

104
00:08:11,987 --> 00:08:14,320
Well, talking to him
is getting us nowhere.

105
00:08:14,412 --> 00:08:17,366
So, maybe we can get
something for him.

106
00:08:18,116 --> 00:08:19,827
You want me to come with you?

107
00:08:23,290 --> 00:08:25,000
You need to stay here.

108
00:08:30,358 --> 00:08:32,429
You need it more than I do.

109
00:08:35,759 --> 00:08:40,236
Do yourself a favor, man.
Don't go out there alone.

110
00:08:40,329 --> 00:08:41,230
All right.

111
00:08:44,738 --> 00:08:46,973
Ha ha. That's how it's done.

112
00:08:47,112 --> 00:08:48,489
Oh, well look at you.

113
00:08:48,769 --> 00:08:52,058
What, that's, like,
four in the last half hour?

114
00:08:52,530 --> 00:08:54,331
Let me call the Guinness book.

115
00:08:54,454 --> 00:08:57,904
You wanna help or not? 'Cause I got
better things to do with my time.

116
00:08:58,853 --> 00:09:02,934
Oh,  happy day.
Here comes Dr. Giggles.

117
00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:06,766
- Hey.
- Hey yourself.

118
00:09:07,889 --> 00:09:11,335
I'm going back out into the jungle to
talk to our friend with the beard.

119
00:09:11,365 --> 00:09:13,267
See if we can make a trade.

120
00:09:13,733 --> 00:09:16,782
Ah, the old prisoner exchange.

121
00:09:17,141 --> 00:09:20,235
And you're inviting me along
'cause you want a gun, huh?

122
00:09:20,338 --> 00:09:22,851
I'm not inviting you.
I'm inviting Kate.

123
00:09:23,225 --> 00:09:26,036
And I've already got a gun,
but thanks for offering.

124
00:09:26,128 --> 00:09:28,078
How in the hell
did you get a gun?

125
00:09:28,218 --> 00:09:29,596
Does it matter?

126
00:09:33,946 --> 00:09:35,323
I'll get my things.

127
00:09:40,243 --> 00:09:43,430
Okay. Two months we've been on
this island, right? Two months.

128
00:09:43,477 --> 00:09:48,761
And already we have a water trough,
and we've got a food pantry,

129
00:09:48,953 --> 00:09:53,474
and people are taking
showers in your... hatch.

130
00:09:53,612 --> 00:09:57,073
Have you forgotten that we
all crashed on this island?

131
00:09:57,540 --> 00:09:59,740
It's like none of you
want to go home again.

132
00:09:59,822 --> 00:10:01,721
How can you say that?
Of course we want to go home.

133
00:10:01,751 --> 00:10:03,574
Then why aren't we
doing anything about it?

134
00:10:03,604 --> 00:10:05,854
Dude, we, like, built a raft...

135
00:10:07,541 --> 00:10:09,443
that got blown up.

136
00:10:09,723 --> 00:10:10,430
Okay.

137
00:10:11,038 --> 00:10:12,848
So what are we doing now?

138
00:10:12,938 --> 00:10:15,891
That pallet of food
had a parachute,

139
00:10:16,005 --> 00:10:17,982
which means a plane
dropped it here,

140
00:10:18,078 --> 00:10:21,328
which means that there are other
planes that fly over the island.

141
00:10:21,455 --> 00:10:23,993
So, we are gonna build a sign.

142
00:10:24,074 --> 00:10:27,220
A massive sign along the beach.

143
00:10:27,414 --> 00:10:29,240
So that way,
if a plane flies over,

144
00:10:29,331 --> 00:10:32,526
or a satellite takes
pictures from up there,

145
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:34,567
we want to make damn sure

146
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:38,427
that they know we're here,
that they know about us.

147
00:10:38,523 --> 00:10:42,158
Maybe we should speak to
Jack about this first.

148
00:10:44,015 --> 00:10:46,778
Well, do we have to
run everything by Jack?

149
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:50,924
I mean, he's not the president.
He's a doctor.

150
00:10:51,066 --> 00:10:52,967
You're a dentist.

151
00:10:56,944 --> 00:11:01,293
Ahem. Uh,
could I speak to you for just a second?

152
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,277
Come on.

153
00:11:05,879 --> 00:11:08,990
Honey, it is just a sign.
I don't see what the harm is.

154
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:12,025
The harm is, you are telling
these people about airplanes

155
00:11:12,119 --> 00:11:15,357
and satellites coming out
of nowhere to save the day.

156
00:11:15,451 --> 00:11:17,640
I'm just trying
to do something.

157
00:11:17,732 --> 00:11:19,219
I want to get back to our life.

158
00:11:19,249 --> 00:11:22,968
Well, the only thing you are doing
is giving these people false hope.

159
00:11:33,448 --> 00:11:34,631
Excuse me.

160
00:11:35,656 --> 00:11:37,660
I have a sign to build.

161
00:11:39,988 --> 00:11:44,009
Ahem. All right. Um, uh,
I wanna get this going right away.

162
00:11:44,367 --> 00:11:45,617
We've waited long enough.

163
00:11:52,427 --> 00:11:54,630
It's just amazing, isn't it?

164
00:11:56,255 --> 00:11:57,870
Oh, sure, it's beautiful.

165
00:11:58,950 --> 00:12:02,144
- You're not impressed, huh?
- Oh, yeah.

166
00:12:02,778 --> 00:12:06,465
So, what does God have to
do to get your attention?

167
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:11,138
Bernard... what are you doing?

168
00:12:22,886 --> 00:12:23,991
Rose...

169
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:27,943
I've been a bachelor
for 56 years.

170
00:12:28,973 --> 00:12:32,548
And then I met you, and...

171
00:12:32,828 --> 00:12:37,894
we just fell into this rhythm like
we had known each other forever.

172
00:12:38,888 --> 00:12:41,725
I had always dreamed of
finding somebody like you,

173
00:12:41,834 --> 00:12:44,198
but I'd given up hope
that I ever would.

174
00:12:44,306 --> 00:12:45,046
Bernard...

175
00:12:45,185 --> 00:12:47,374
Oh, I know, I know. It's crazy.

176
00:12:47,496 --> 00:12:51,198
Uh, we just met
five months ago.

177
00:12:52,571 --> 00:12:55,088
But five months is long enough.

178
00:12:56,013 --> 00:12:59,159
Because I knew
after five minutes.

179
00:13:03,335 --> 00:13:04,563
Rose...

180
00:13:06,634 --> 00:13:07,894
I love you.

181
00:13:10,374 --> 00:13:11,960
Will you marry me?

182
00:13:17,607 --> 00:13:19,507
Bernard, I'm dying.

183
00:13:25,264 --> 00:13:28,572
I'm sick, and I'm dying.

184
00:13:33,944 --> 00:13:37,081
Uh, would you excuse us
for a minute, please?

185
00:13:50,002 --> 00:13:53,909
I've been in remission for
the last couple of years.

186
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:59,234
But now, it's back, and this time,
it's not going away.

187
00:14:00,122 --> 00:14:03,478
My doctor says I
have about a year,

188
00:14:04,403 --> 00:14:07,922
maybe a little longer.

189
00:14:23,133 --> 00:14:25,526
You haven't answered
my question.

190
00:14:27,531 --> 00:14:30,479
Are... you sure?

191
00:14:35,722 --> 00:14:37,885
Oh, I'm sure.

192
00:14:45,212 --> 00:14:46,164
Yes...

193
00:14:48,543 --> 00:14:49,393
Y es.

194
00:14:56,649 --> 00:15:00,846
Well, you bunk with a guy for 48 days,
now he doesn't call or write.

195
00:15:00,939 --> 00:15:01,800
Hello, Bernard.

196
00:15:02,490 --> 00:15:05,543
What do you boys
got going up here?

197
00:15:06,006 --> 00:15:07,290
Just working.

198
00:15:07,427 --> 00:15:10,093
Well, listen.
I've got a whole team of folks

199
00:15:10,233 --> 00:15:12,949
throwing together a big
sign down along the beach.

200
00:15:13,089 --> 00:15:15,989
Hopefully, it'll get us spotted
by a plane or a satellite.

201
00:15:16,085 --> 00:15:19,246
We could sure use all the bodies we
could get to help put it together.

202
00:15:19,276 --> 00:15:20,567
Sorry, I'm busy.

203
00:15:22,391 --> 00:15:23,385
Charlie?

204
00:15:23,527 --> 00:15:26,457
Ah, regrets, Bernard.
I've only got two hands, you know.

205
00:15:27,133 --> 00:15:28,794
Good luck, though.

206
00:15:31,181 --> 00:15:33,337
Well, could I at least
grab some of these logs?

207
00:15:33,367 --> 00:15:35,365
We  could sure use--
we're using them.

208
00:15:35,610 --> 00:15:38,536
- For what, exactly?
- A church.

209
00:15:40,685 --> 00:15:43,878
- A church?
- Yes.

210
00:15:44,672 --> 00:15:47,626
Everybody on this island
is building something.

211
00:15:47,767 --> 00:15:50,099
I'm trying to get us saved.

212
00:15:51,128 --> 00:15:54,286
People are saved in
different ways, Bernard.

213
00:15:56,098 --> 00:16:00,008
I think I liked you better when you
just hit people with your stick.

214
00:16:03,941 --> 00:16:06,287
I like you just
the way you are.

215
00:16:37,401 --> 00:16:39,189
I need to talk to him.

216
00:16:39,890 --> 00:16:43,174
The gun's with Jack.
The door stays closed.

217
00:16:45,183 --> 00:16:48,414
But if you wanna talk to him,
talk to him.

218
00:17:02,223 --> 00:17:04,718
Henry, can you hear me?

219
00:17:06,851 --> 00:17:09,708
It's John, Henry.

220
00:17:17,942 --> 00:17:20,900
Henry, did you
enter the numbers?

221
00:17:23,365 --> 00:17:26,081
Did you push the button or not?

222
00:17:27,765 --> 00:17:32,325
Henry! I need to know.
I want you to answer me.

223
00:17:33,648 --> 00:17:38,358
Answer me, Henry!

224
00:17:49,686 --> 00:17:52,076
What happened to everybody?

225
00:17:52,302 --> 00:17:54,253
Where's, uh, where's Craig?

226
00:17:54,434 --> 00:17:55,765
Where's Frogurt?

227
00:17:57,212 --> 00:17:58,974
Okay. All right. Moving on.

228
00:17:59,065 --> 00:18:01,565
We're gonna put the sign
across this entire beach,

229
00:18:01,773 --> 00:18:06,639
which means the letters have to
be really big-- about 40 feet.

230
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:11,551
These black rocks will get
maximum contrast with the sand.

231
00:18:12,017 --> 00:18:14,650
Dude, we're likely to
need a lot more rocks.

232
00:18:14,776 --> 00:18:17,826
Yes, Hurley.
We are gonna need a lot more rocks.

233
00:18:18,017 --> 00:18:20,509
There's a lava field about
a half a mile inland.

234
00:18:20,627 --> 00:18:24,077
It's just loaded with them. We're
gonna haul them out in 2-man teams.

235
00:18:24,152 --> 00:18:26,158
So, uh, you guys double up,

236
00:18:26,303 --> 00:18:30,535
and I am gonna start sketching off the
letters in the sand. Let's do this.

237
00:18:30,673 --> 00:18:33,103
Hey, um,
I can sketch the letters.

238
00:18:33,242 --> 00:18:34,742
Everybody's got a job, Hurley.

239
00:18:34,783 --> 00:18:37,284
I do my job, you do yours.

240
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:41,078
What? What'd he say?

241
00:18:41,149 --> 00:18:45,334
I think he's not so crazy about the
whole "carry the rocks a half
mile" thing.

242
00:18:45,888 --> 00:18:48,412
Okay... well,this
is gonna take time.

243
00:18:48,505 --> 00:18:53,470
But if this is the thing that gets us
off this place, isn't that worth it?

244
00:18:53,624 --> 00:18:55,515
Rome wasn't built in a day,
you know.

245
00:18:56,164 --> 00:19:00,676
Ah, no, you don't... okay.
All right, let's get started. Come on.

246
00:19:04,191 --> 00:19:09,008
We're lost. Oh, you saying we're lost
doesn't make us lost, sweetheart.

247
00:19:09,149 --> 00:19:12,538
- I know exactly where we are.
- Me, too.

248
00:19:12,626 --> 00:19:16,393
Driving around in circles in
the middle of the outback.

249
00:19:17,001 --> 00:19:20,719
That's why I wanted to be on
a beach for our honeymoon.

250
00:19:22,997 --> 00:19:28,103
Thank goodness. Civilization.
Bernard, let's get directions.

251
00:19:28,193 --> 00:19:32,605
Oh, I don't need directions.
I told you, honey. We're not lost.

252
00:19:33,283 --> 00:19:37,712
Bernard, what's going on?

253
00:19:37,979 --> 00:19:40,311
I brought you out here...

254
00:19:40,833 --> 00:19:43,589
because I want you
to see this man.

255
00:19:43,681 --> 00:19:49,572
His name is Isaac of Uluru.
And he's helped hundreds of people.

256
00:19:49,652 --> 00:19:53,986
Now, I know how it looks,
but believe me, he is completely legit.

257
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,073
Bernard...

258
00:19:55,597 --> 00:19:59,162
you brought me to
a faith healer?

259
00:20:04,124 --> 00:20:06,648
He's the real deal, Rose.

260
00:20:06,787 --> 00:20:09,455
Once I started telling
people about your situation,

261
00:20:09,547 --> 00:20:11,710
I got three separate
calls recommending him.

262
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:12,891
My situation?

263
00:20:14,955 --> 00:20:18,027
This is why you wanted
to come to Australia?

264
00:20:18,166 --> 00:20:21,025
To bring me to some
kind of a kook?

265
00:20:21,118 --> 00:20:22,069
No, he's not.

266
00:20:22,227 --> 00:20:25,971
Rose, I made a $10,000 donation just
to get you in to see him. Normally--

267
00:20:26,109 --> 00:20:28,776
I didn't ask for this!

268
00:20:37,145 --> 00:20:38,545
It's just...

269
00:20:43,335 --> 00:20:44,615
Bernard...

270
00:20:46,049 --> 00:20:50,710
I have made my peace with
what's happeningto me.

271
00:20:54,063 --> 00:20:56,015
Well, I haven't.

272
00:20:57,745 --> 00:21:00,951
I can't just do nothing, Rose.

273
00:21:01,545 --> 00:21:04,370
That's not me.
That's not who I am.

274
00:21:05,273 --> 00:21:07,223
I have to try.

275
00:21:09,562 --> 00:21:12,278
Will you try, Rose?

276
00:21:15,647 --> 00:21:16,887
For me.

277
00:21:24,029 --> 00:21:26,720
Okay, it's just gonna be great.
It's gonna be a really big sign.

278
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:27,541
That's great.

279
00:21:27,918 --> 00:21:31,537
If you have time to fix your hut,
you'll have time to move some rocks.

280
00:21:32,753 --> 00:21:34,989
Come on.
We could really use your help.

281
00:21:35,083 --> 00:21:38,482
What, you got union trouble down
at the sand factory, Norma Rae?

282
00:21:40,713 --> 00:21:45,473
Come on, Sawyer. I need your help.
Now what do you say?

283
00:21:46,214 --> 00:21:47,494
I say...

284
00:21:48,663 --> 00:21:50,305
pas-adena.

285
00:22:04,569 --> 00:22:07,704
- Well, I hope you're happy.
- About what?

286
00:22:07,857 --> 00:22:10,336
This morning I had 15 people
willing to work on the sign,

287
00:22:10,366 --> 00:22:13,724
- and now I'm down to 4.
- And how is that my fault?

288
00:22:14,070 --> 00:22:19,033
At the very least, I expected your
support. You had to go and attack me.

289
00:22:19,126 --> 00:22:22,701
Have you ever stopped to think,
maybe the reason people are quitting

290
00:22:22,794 --> 00:22:26,035
is because you've got yourself
a management problem?

291
00:22:28,047 --> 00:22:30,523
What is the matter
with you, Rose?

292
00:22:30,911 --> 00:22:33,133
I am just trying
to do something.

293
00:22:33,296 --> 00:22:35,746
That's  exactly right.
You're always trying to do.

294
00:22:35,793 --> 00:22:38,604
Why can't you just
let things be?

295
00:22:40,428 --> 00:22:44,592
If I didn't always have to do something,
you wouldn't be here.

296
00:23:10,418 --> 00:23:11,854
I'm flattered.

297
00:23:13,123 --> 00:23:14,625
Yeah? Why is that?

298
00:23:14,763 --> 00:23:18,035
'Cause you chose me to go
with you instead of Sawyer.

299
00:23:18,704 --> 00:23:22,101
I asked Sayid first,
but he turned me down.

300
00:23:23,211 --> 00:23:25,955
And I only asked you
because they don't want you.

301
00:23:26,703 --> 00:23:29,325
They grabbed you,
had you at gunpoint.

302
00:23:29,791 --> 00:23:32,198
They could have kept you,
but they didn't.

303
00:23:32,309 --> 00:23:35,125
Then again,
they didn't really want me, either.

304
00:23:35,634 --> 00:23:37,520
Damaged goods.

305
00:23:38,236 --> 00:23:40,001
Both of us.

306
00:23:52,897 --> 00:23:53,776
What's that?

307
00:23:58,961 --> 00:23:59,669
K ate.

308
00:24:02,498 --> 00:24:03,587
It's a doll.

309
00:24:03,728 --> 00:24:07,839
Wait, wait, no-- no, don't--

310
00:24:15,738 --> 00:24:16,753
Sorry.

311
00:24:23,097 --> 00:24:25,673
- You okay?
- Yeah.

312
00:24:25,809 --> 00:24:28,021
Oh, good. So you can hear me.

313
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:31,785
This isn't one of theirs.

314
00:24:32,025 --> 00:24:34,616
No. It's not
sophisticated enough.

315
00:24:35,133 --> 00:24:38,497
Must be one of Rousseau's traps.
Hopefully she's not far from here.

316
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:41,354
Could be a week
before she shows up.

317
00:24:43,810 --> 00:24:46,260
- What are you doing?
- I'm trying to get the gun.

318
00:24:46,738 --> 00:24:49,438
- I can't get my arm around.
- All right, here, let me.

319
00:24:51,136 --> 00:24:51,903
All right.

320
00:24:56,889 --> 00:24:57,781
Sorry.

321
00:24:58,481 --> 00:25:00,131
- I don't wanna shoot you.
- Okay.

322
00:25:01,546 --> 00:25:04,072
- Okay.
- You got it?

323
00:25:04,163 --> 00:25:05,682
- Okay, ready?
- Yeah.

324
00:25:05,831 --> 00:25:07,786
Got it, got it, got it.
Oh, all right.

325
00:25:07,933 --> 00:25:09,623
There, got it.

326
00:25:09,793 --> 00:25:11,535
Now, give me the gun.

327
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:13,447
Why, what for?

328
00:25:13,863 --> 00:25:15,891
Gonna try to shoot the rope.

329
00:25:19,298 --> 00:25:20,598
Whoa, whoa, hey, hey, hey!

330
00:25:20,606 --> 00:25:22,156
I'm a better shot than you are.

331
00:25:22,267 --> 00:25:23,211
Oh, really?

332
00:25:23,397 --> 00:25:26,611
Yeah, I told you.
I grew up hunting with my dad.

333
00:25:32,891 --> 00:25:33,808
Damn it!

334
00:25:34,386 --> 00:25:36,592
Well, at least they
know where we are.

335
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:37,980
Okay, now give me the gun.

336
00:25:38,025 --> 00:25:39,925
And you're gonna
waste another bullet?

337
00:25:40,533 --> 00:25:44,025
Don't worry. We'll still have 13 more
to shoot each other with. Come on.

338
00:25:44,055 --> 00:25:47,088
Fine. You have a better
angle than I do, anyway.

339
00:25:47,175 --> 00:25:49,825
Oh, that's gonna be your
excuse when I make the shot.

340
00:25:49,863 --> 00:25:51,292
When you make the shot.

341
00:25:56,060 --> 00:25:56,866
Okay.

342
00:26:08,564 --> 00:26:09,621
Nice shot.

343
00:26:13,443 --> 00:26:14,581
No!

344
00:26:14,733 --> 00:26:18,012
No, no, no, no, no!
You're doing it all wrong!

345
00:26:18,151 --> 00:26:20,058
I told you three rows.

346
00:26:20,330 --> 00:26:24,145
Three-- so they can
see it from the air.

347
00:26:26,361 --> 00:26:29,045
Three rows! How hard is that?

348
00:26:33,209 --> 00:26:35,397
Do I just have to do
everything myself?

349
00:26:39,438 --> 00:26:41,723
No! No, no, no!
No, Jin. No, wait.

350
00:26:43,078 --> 00:26:44,168
Please...

351
00:26:45,618 --> 00:26:49,099
I just want to
get my wife home.

352
00:26:50,406 --> 00:26:51,861
Rose.

353
00:26:54,149 --> 00:26:56,630
I wanna get Rose home.

354
00:27:01,725 --> 00:27:02,736
Sorry.

355
00:27:20,537 --> 00:27:22,652
You're in my spot.

356
00:27:26,391 --> 00:27:28,005
I can move.

357
00:27:28,707 --> 00:27:30,086
Can you?

358
00:27:30,943 --> 00:27:32,596
Oh, that's funny.

359
00:27:33,756 --> 00:27:38,016
I guess your sense of humor got
trapped under that door with your leg.

360
00:27:42,007 --> 00:27:46,641
I saw your husband walking
through the jungle, hauling rocks.

361
00:27:47,804 --> 00:27:51,220
He's building a big
sign in the sand,

362
00:27:51,329 --> 00:27:54,027
so the satellites will see it.

363
00:27:55,447 --> 00:27:59,756
That man doesn't know the difference
between an errand and a fool's errand.

364
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:05,522
Well, Rose, most of us don't.

365
00:28:06,504 --> 00:28:09,018
So what are you doing
down here, John?

366
00:28:09,119 --> 00:28:12,698
Can't remember the last time
I saw you out of that hatch.

367
00:28:14,021 --> 00:28:16,680
I'm done with the hatch.

368
00:28:17,296 --> 00:28:19,470
Oh, now,
you're just frustrated.

369
00:28:19,706 --> 00:28:24,471
You'll be out of that splint and running
around the island again in no time.

370
00:28:24,818 --> 00:28:29,711
Hmm. And yet Jack said it'd
beat least four weeks.

371
00:28:29,879 --> 00:28:35,086
But, honey, you and I both know
it's not gonna take that long.

372
00:28:52,166 --> 00:28:53,694
Right this way, Rose.

373
00:28:57,896 --> 00:28:59,596
Please, make
yourself comfortable.

374
00:28:59,664 --> 00:29:01,635
Isaac will be right with you.

375
00:29:26,673 --> 00:29:28,289
You must be Rose.

376
00:29:29,833 --> 00:29:31,353
Why don't you have a seat?

377
00:29:36,562 --> 00:29:39,331
So, um... how does this work?

378
00:29:40,432 --> 00:29:43,917
I sit here and you chant?
Or, um...

379
00:29:44,631 --> 00:29:46,660
pray or what?

380
00:29:47,216 --> 00:29:49,733
There are certain places
with great energy--

381
00:29:49,879 --> 00:29:53,692
spots on the Earth,
like the one we're above now.

382
00:29:54,044 --> 00:29:58,681
Perhaps this energy is
geological, magnetic.

383
00:29:59,990 --> 00:30:03,107
Or perhaps it's something else.

384
00:30:03,261 --> 00:30:07,646
And, when possible,
I harness this energy

385
00:30:08,013 --> 00:30:10,180
and give it to others.

386
00:30:11,183 --> 00:30:12,425
May I?

387
00:30:33,214 --> 00:30:34,112
What?

388
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:37,120
What-- what is it?

389
00:30:39,148 --> 00:30:40,099
I'm sorry.

390
00:30:43,649 --> 00:30:45,730
Can't do anything
for you, Rose.

391
00:30:49,669 --> 00:30:51,908
I didn't expect you to.

392
00:30:59,608 --> 00:31:01,614
It's not that you
can't be healed.

393
00:31:02,344 --> 00:31:07,409
Like I said,
there's different energies.

394
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:09,505
This is not the
right place for you.

395
00:31:10,613 --> 00:31:13,395
Where is the right place?

396
00:31:14,795 --> 00:31:16,560
I wish I knew.

397
00:31:18,883 --> 00:31:20,613
I'll return your
husband's donation.

398
00:31:20,643 --> 00:31:21,585
Don't.

399
00:31:24,963 --> 00:31:27,421
I'm gonna tell
him you fixed me.

400
00:31:33,373 --> 00:31:36,837
I'm going to tell
him you fixed me.

401
00:31:51,067 --> 00:31:52,912
What did you mean back there?

402
00:31:53,997 --> 00:31:54,892
What?

403
00:31:55,265 --> 00:31:56,333
In the net.

404
00:31:56,886 --> 00:31:59,136
You said they were sophisticated,
the others.

405
00:32:00,622 --> 00:32:07,181
Uh... last week,
when the baby got sick,

406
00:32:07,677 --> 00:32:11,352
Claire and I went into the jungle and,
uh, found another hatch.

407
00:32:12,238 --> 00:32:13,043
What?

408
00:32:13,302 --> 00:32:14,733
Like a medical station.

409
00:32:15,387 --> 00:32:18,573
There was nothing you could use.
It was all cleared out, but...

410
00:32:18,870 --> 00:32:20,980
I found some lockers.

411
00:32:21,102 --> 00:32:24,013
They had clothes inside,
all worn and dirty.

412
00:32:24,270 --> 00:32:27,789
They were on hangers, like...
like costumes, you know?

413
00:32:27,912 --> 00:32:31,012
And there was a make up kit...

414
00:32:31,990 --> 00:32:33,871
and a fake beard.

415
00:32:35,677 --> 00:32:37,737
When were you going
to tell me this?

416
00:32:38,509 --> 00:32:41,461
When you decided to let
me back in the club.

417
00:32:43,802 --> 00:32:44,703
What?

418
00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:49,984
You can keep one of them locked up in
the hatch for a week, and say nothing.

419
00:32:50,079 --> 00:32:51,517
But then, when I--

420
00:32:54,767 --> 00:32:56,441
We're here.

421
00:32:57,657 --> 00:32:58,937
Are you sure? I...

422
00:32:59,125 --> 00:33:01,887
That's where they took
the shot at Sawyer.

423
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:04,250
Right over there is where they

424
00:33:04,436 --> 00:33:07,447
pushed you out of the jungle
with a bag on your head.

425
00:33:07,558 --> 00:33:09,749
And right there is where I...

426
00:33:10,580 --> 00:33:12,791
where I laid my gun down.

427
00:33:19,028 --> 00:33:19,995
Hey!

428
00:33:22,985 --> 00:33:24,901
Hey, I'm back!

429
00:33:27,217 --> 00:33:29,375
You say you're watching us?

430
00:33:29,873 --> 00:33:34,035
Do you hear me?!
We've got your man!

431
00:33:35,442 --> 00:33:38,292
If you want him back,
you're gonna have to come out here!

432
00:33:41,128 --> 00:33:43,798
- Come on out!
- Jack!

433
00:33:43,863 --> 00:33:46,263
I know you're out there!
I know you can hear me!

434
00:33:46,271 --> 00:33:48,318
Jack, they're not here.

435
00:33:48,690 --> 00:33:51,844
I'll be right here
until you talk to me!

436
00:33:53,567 --> 00:33:55,301
I'll be right here!

437
00:34:11,539 --> 00:34:13,249
I brought you some supper.

438
00:34:15,078 --> 00:34:17,150
Thanks. You can just
set it down there.

439
00:34:23,325 --> 00:34:25,276
Where is everybody?

440
00:34:32,157 --> 00:34:34,646
I owe you an apology.

441
00:34:34,726 --> 00:34:36,140
You don't have anything
to be sorry for.

442
00:34:36,170 --> 00:34:38,470
It's my own damn fault
I'm out here by myself.

443
00:34:38,618 --> 00:34:41,195
That's not why I'm apologizing.

444
00:34:43,575 --> 00:34:45,434
I lied to you.

445
00:34:48,061 --> 00:34:52,227
Back in Australia.
Isaac-- he didn't heal me.

446
00:34:54,118 --> 00:34:55,930
He didn't do anything.

447
00:34:58,826 --> 00:35:04,565
- Of course he did. You're-- you're--
- Bernard... he didn't heal me.

448
00:35:06,051 --> 00:35:09,569
But that doesn't
mean I'm not healed.

449
00:35:12,939 --> 00:35:17,254
When you're sick,
and you've got something inside you

450
00:35:17,362 --> 00:35:23,234
that doesn't belong there,
you can feel it. And after the crash,

451
00:35:24,403 --> 00:35:27,568
I couldn't feel it anymore.

452
00:35:27,740 --> 00:35:30,889
At first,
I thought it was just shock.

453
00:35:33,927 --> 00:35:35,773
But it wasn't.

454
00:35:38,521 --> 00:35:40,366
It's this place.

455
00:35:43,046 --> 00:35:45,601
But-- but you said
Isaac fixed you.

456
00:35:45,764 --> 00:35:48,181
I told you that so that

457
00:35:48,293 --> 00:35:54,020
you wouldn't spend what time we
had left trying to do something.

458
00:35:58,223 --> 00:36:00,954
Uh... Rose,
you could just be in remission.

459
00:36:01,323 --> 00:36:03,673
How do you know it wasn't
Isaac who healed you?

460
00:36:03,702 --> 00:36:06,028
How do you know that
he didn't heal you?

461
00:36:09,110 --> 00:36:09,993
I know.

462
00:36:10,086 --> 00:36:11,249
I know.

463
00:36:26,465 --> 00:36:27,934
These yours?

464
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:30,849
Uh, thank you.

465
00:36:32,744 --> 00:36:34,527
You're welcome.

466
00:36:40,775 --> 00:36:42,548
Trust me.

467
00:36:43,742 --> 00:36:45,257
I know.

468
00:36:53,483 --> 00:36:55,655
You don't want to be rescued,
do you?

469
00:36:58,700 --> 00:37:00,452
You think if you leave...

470
00:37:02,005 --> 00:37:03,328
it'll come back.

471
00:37:06,534 --> 00:37:09,436
And if you can't leave...

472
00:37:12,613 --> 00:37:14,246
neither can I.

473
00:37:19,477 --> 00:37:21,953
We won't ever leave, Rose.

474
00:37:35,158 --> 00:37:40,646
I would, uh, I would offer to
take down the sign, but, um...

475
00:37:41,061 --> 00:37:42,669
we didn't get very far.

476
00:38:09,989 --> 00:38:10,763
Hey.

477
00:38:12,582 --> 00:38:13,428
Hi.

478
00:38:16,611 --> 00:38:17,772
I pressed your button.

479
00:38:19,811 --> 00:38:21,169
It's not my button.

480
00:38:24,908 --> 00:38:26,110
Where'd you go?

481
00:38:28,510 --> 00:38:33,642
I just needed to...

482
00:40:40,428 --> 00:40:42,664
How long are you
gonna wait, Jack?

483
00:40:44,865 --> 00:40:46,919
Till I get my voice back.

484
00:40:47,102 --> 00:40:48,898
Then I'm gonna yell some more.

485
00:40:53,770 --> 00:40:55,891
Maybe they can't hear you.

486
00:40:58,159 --> 00:40:59,717
They can hear me.

487
00:41:06,885 --> 00:41:09,178
I'm sorry I kissed you.

488
00:41:18,695 --> 00:41:20,225
I'm not.

489
00:42:03,003 --> 00:42:03,495
Michael.
