00:00:00,466 --> 00:00:01,910
<i>Previously, on</i> Lost...

2
00:00:01,968 --> 00:00:03,509
You brought me here to operate on you.

3
00:00:03,528 --> 00:00:05,705
You think, I trust you,
that I am gonna just...

4
00:00:05,763 --> 00:00:08,594
do the surgery and hope
that you let me go?

5
00:00:10,605 --> 00:00:11,605
You have to do it.

6
00:00:12,145 --> 00:00:13,956
- How did they get you to ask me?
- Please--

7
00:00:13,975 --> 00:00:15,476
- What did they offer you?
- Nothing.

8
00:00:15,514 --> 00:00:18,262
- Then what are you doing here?
- They're gonna kill Sawyer...

9
00:00:24,775 --> 00:00:26,316
Tomorrow morning, first thing,

10
00:00:26,526 --> 00:00:28,750
we'll get it out,
and they'll keep you alive.

11
00:00:31,437 --> 00:00:32,532
I'm ready.

12
00:00:35,391 --> 00:00:36,594
Sawyer, please!

13
00:00:36,646 --> 00:00:38,388
You get your hands off of him!

14
00:00:40,954 --> 00:00:43,313
I just made a small incision
in Ben's kidney sac.

15
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:47,184
Now if I don't stitch that back up
in the next hour, he's dead.

16
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:50,087
Now get in here,
and bring that walkie-talkie.

17
00:00:52,450 --> 00:00:56,286
3x07 - Not In Portland

18
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,507
I fell asleep.

19
00:02:24,905 --> 00:02:26,975
With candles burning-- that's real safe.

20
00:02:33,417 --> 00:02:35,306
We don't have to keep doing this,
you know.

21
00:02:35,971 --> 00:02:38,773
Are you saying that
because you don't think it's gonna work

22
00:02:39,739 --> 00:02:41,674
or because you're afraid he'll find out?

23
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:47,199
Lift up your shirt.

24
00:03:08,982 --> 00:03:10,050
Some doctor you are.

25
00:03:10,205 --> 00:03:11,716
I'm not doing this as your doctor.

26
00:03:11,755 --> 00:03:13,170
I'm doing it as your sister.

27
00:03:16,411 --> 00:03:18,192
I don't like you being here alone.

28
00:03:18,464 --> 00:03:19,629
Come stay with me.

29
00:03:20,172 --> 00:03:21,953
I like living on the beach.

30
00:03:23,271 --> 00:03:25,322
This is Miami, Rachel.

31
00:03:26,477 --> 00:03:27,796
Everything's on the beach.

32
00:03:34,792 --> 00:03:37,238
You have about an hour head start
before they come after you.

33
00:03:37,277 --> 00:03:39,087
Take the walkie, take Sawyer and go.

34
00:03:39,125 --> 00:03:40,484
<i>Wait. Where are you?<I/>

35
00:03:40,561 --> 00:03:42,246
Kate, listen to me. Just listen to me.

36
00:03:42,478 --> 00:03:44,186
You remember
what I told you on the beach?

37
00:03:44,205 --> 00:03:47,132
Do you rember what story I told you
when you were stitching me up?

38
00:03:48,506 --> 00:03:49,506
Do you rember it?!

39
00:03:49,559 --> 00:03:51,032
Yes, yes, I remember!

40
00:03:52,862 --> 00:03:56,608
When you get safe, you radio me
and you tell me that story.

41
00:03:56,764 --> 00:03:57,775
<i>Jack, please--</i>

42
00:03:57,776 --> 00:03:59,774
If I don't get a call from you
in the next hour,

43
00:03:59,812 --> 00:04:01,834
I'm gonna know something went wrong,
and he dies!

44
00:04:01,944 --> 00:04:03,513
<i>I can't leave without you.</i>

45
00:04:03,542 --> 00:04:04,542
Yes, you are. Go.

46
00:04:04,604 --> 00:04:06,712
- Jack, I can't!
- Go, now.

47
00:04:06,792 --> 00:04:07,812
I can't!

48
00:04:08,132 --> 00:04:09,847
Kate, damn it, run!

49
00:04:15,321 --> 00:04:17,699
Juliet, stop the bleeding
and stitch him up.

50
00:04:18,024 --> 00:04:19,024
She's not a surgeon.

51
00:04:19,082 --> 00:04:20,082
She can't fix this.

52
00:04:22,495 --> 00:04:23,495
He's right.

53
00:04:33,331 --> 00:04:34,331
Let's go.

54
00:04:36,618 --> 00:04:37,631
<i>Warning.</i>

55
00:04:37,632 --> 00:04:38,632
Sawyer, let's go!

56
00:04:53,079 --> 00:04:54,879
Then what the hell do you suggest we do?

57
00:04:57,702 --> 00:04:58,944
Go get Danny,

58
00:04:59,367 --> 00:05:02,815
then find Austen and Ford
and bring them back.

59
00:05:02,905 --> 00:05:06,458
- No, you do that, and Ben dies.
- Go.

60
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:09,108
You think I'm lying?
Do you think this is a bluff?

61
00:05:09,165 --> 00:05:11,905
- I will let him die!
- No, Jack, you won't.

62
00:05:14,617 --> 00:05:16,485
Go. Get them back.

63
00:05:17,844 --> 00:05:19,028
If you have to...

64
00:05:21,092 --> 00:05:22,141
kill them.

<i>- Dr. Burke?</i>
- Yes.

67
00:06:01,633 --> 00:06:03,328
<i>This is Diana from Mittelos Bioscience.</i>

68
00:06:03,383 --> 00:06:05,405
<i>I'm calling to confirm
your appointment tomorrow.</i>

69
00:06:05,504 --> 00:06:06,688
Uh, 2:00, right?

70
00:06:06,759 --> 00:06:08,368
<i>2:00. Dr. Alpert asked me to tell you</i>

71
00:06:08,425 --> 00:06:10,485
<i>that he's very much looking forward
to meeting you.</i>

72
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:12,040
Me, too. Thank you.

73
00:06:12,213 --> 00:06:13,213
<i>Good-Bye.</i>

74
00:07:05,034 --> 00:07:06,034
Stay here.

75
00:07:11,099 --> 00:07:12,244
Hello, Juliet.

76
00:07:21,308 --> 00:07:22,848
Why exactly are you here?

77
00:07:23,468 --> 00:07:24,797
Oh, I, m...

78
00:07:24,835 --> 00:07:26,019
today's lab work...

79
00:07:26,164 --> 00:07:29,197
I got home, and I realized
that inverted some numbers.

80
00:07:29,893 --> 00:07:31,627
And it couldn't wait till the morning?

81
00:07:33,531 --> 00:07:34,965
Um... Edmund?

82
00:07:36,434 --> 00:07:37,434
I'm sorry.

83
00:07:37,687 --> 00:07:38,687
How rude of me.

84
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:40,319
Uh, Juliet, this is Sherry.

85
00:07:40,397 --> 00:07:41,952
Sherry, this is Juliet,

86
00:07:42,744 --> 00:07:43,744
My ex-wife.

87
00:07:47,603 --> 00:07:48,603
Juliet's leaving.

88
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:52,551
I am.

89
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:01,237
Could you please turn off the lights?

90
00:08:13,462 --> 00:08:15,042
You haven't thought this through, Jack.

91
00:08:15,052 --> 00:08:16,505
Your plan's not gonna work.

92
00:08:16,754 --> 00:08:17,938
Yeah? Why is that?

93
00:08:17,969 --> 00:08:20,145
Your friends aren't going
to make it back to your side

94
00:08:20,165 --> 00:08:22,322
of the island
because we're not on that island.

95
00:08:24,014 --> 00:08:26,527
We're on a smaller island
2 miles offshore.

96
00:08:29,071 --> 00:08:30,071
'Fraid so.

97
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:36,907
So why don't we see if we can come up

98
00:08:36,944 --> 00:08:39,026
with some kind of peaceful resolution?

99
00:08:42,238 --> 00:08:43,458
A peaceful resolution?

100
00:08:43,515 --> 00:08:44,517
That's right.

101
00:08:44,539 --> 00:08:46,592
Is that what you call
asking me to kill Ben

102
00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:48,075
while on the operang table--

103
00:08:48,162 --> 00:08:50,304
- Make it look like an accident?
- That's ridiculous.

104
00:08:50,328 --> 00:08:51,878
- She wants Ben to die.
- He's lying.

105
00:08:51,901 --> 00:08:54,250
She said if I did it,
that she would protect me--

106
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:55,503
Enough!

107
00:09:01,330 --> 00:09:02,350
Get out.

108
00:09:02,967 --> 00:09:04,286
Tom, he's lying.

109
00:09:04,323 --> 00:09:05,892
You said you can't stitch him up...

110
00:09:06,321 --> 00:09:07,929
then you don't need to be in here.

111
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:10,280
Go, Julie.

112
00:09:17,892 --> 00:09:19,200
Don't let him fool you.

113
00:09:19,891 --> 00:09:21,942
He'll never let a patient just die.

114
00:09:29,194 --> 00:09:30,446
Can anybody hear me?!

115
00:09:33,759 --> 00:09:34,759
What happened?

116
00:09:35,012 --> 00:09:36,012
Open the cage.

117
00:09:36,052 --> 00:09:37,986
- Where is--
- Just open the damn cage!

118
00:09:57,802 --> 00:09:58,909
That's our island?

119
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:01,059
What, you didn't believe me
when I told you before?

120
00:10:01,103 --> 00:10:02,113
We need a boat.

121
00:10:02,450 --> 00:10:04,520
Yeah, a couple of towels
and a buffet lunch.

122
00:10:04,558 --> 00:10:05,656
We'll follow the beach.

123
00:10:05,702 --> 00:10:07,436
There's gotta be one
around here somewhere.

124
00:10:07,455 --> 00:10:08,938
How else do they get back and forth?

125
00:10:09,376 --> 00:10:11,619
Why don't we just stop
and ask for directions?

126
00:10:15,132 --> 00:10:16,538
<i>Jack, are you there?</i>

127
00:10:17,576 --> 00:10:19,233
<i>- Yeah, I'm here.</i>
- Are you okay?

128
00:10:19,284 --> 00:10:20,882
<i>- I'm fine.</i>
- Tell him I said "hi"?

129
00:10:20,921 --> 00:10:22,902
- Get to the point!
- We need a boat.

130
00:10:23,292 --> 00:10:25,651
We need some way
to get off of this island.

131
00:10:26,502 --> 00:10:27,502
You heard her.

132
00:10:28,549 --> 00:10:30,253
How do they get off this island?!

133
00:10:32,292 --> 00:10:33,292
What's he doing?

134
00:10:45,911 --> 00:10:46,911
Come on!

135
00:11:31,612 --> 00:11:32,612
This way!

136
00:11:34,111 --> 00:11:35,564
Jason, you all right?

137
00:11:38,651 --> 00:11:39,873
Over there! There!

138
00:11:48,793 --> 00:11:51,718
Come on! Get inside, get inside! Go!

139
00:11:56,857 --> 00:11:57,857
Come on!

140
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:03,642
Be quiet, be quiet, be quiet.

141
00:12:08,028 --> 00:12:09,028
What?

142
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:11,530
Where'd they go?

143
00:12:12,233 --> 00:12:13,233
That way.

144
00:12:23,999 --> 00:12:25,183
Nice to meet you, Sheena.

145
00:12:27,907 --> 00:12:28,907
Is it true?

146
00:12:29,557 --> 00:12:30,557
Is what true?

147
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:31,910
What you said--

148
00:12:32,965 --> 00:12:35,189
Did Juliet really ask you to kill him?

149
00:12:37,611 --> 00:12:38,632
Yeah...

150
00:12:39,083 --> 00:12:41,480
and in about 40 minutes,
she's gonna get her wish.

151
00:12:48,595 --> 00:12:51,428
That's... not... helping...

152
00:12:52,604 --> 00:12:53,604
anything.

153
00:12:58,610 --> 00:12:59,610
Now...

154
00:13:01,116 --> 00:13:03,802
could somebody please get Juliet?

155
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:16,362
Edmund wants to see you in his office.

156
00:13:18,509 --> 00:13:19,509
Do you work here?

157
00:13:20,606 --> 00:13:22,175
I'm the new research assistant.

158
00:13:24,517 --> 00:13:25,517
Of course you are.

159
00:13:41,842 --> 00:13:42,842
I want in.

160
00:13:44,943 --> 00:13:45,943
In on what?

161
00:13:45,996 --> 00:13:47,546
I know what you're doing, Juliet.

162
00:13:50,503 --> 00:13:51,706
I'm not really sure what--

163
00:13:51,751 --> 00:13:52,954
I read your notes.

164
00:13:54,354 --> 00:13:55,865
I know what you took from the lab.

165
00:13:55,958 --> 00:13:57,527
The only thing I don't know is...

166
00:13:59,059 --> 00:14:00,722
who's your guinea pig?

167
00:14:03,532 --> 00:14:04,697
Ed, I've...

168
00:14:05,283 --> 00:14:09,568
I've been doing my research
in my own lab, on my own time.

169
00:14:09,992 --> 00:14:12,337
- I don't really see--
- It's your sister, isn't it?

170
00:14:14,797 --> 00:14:17,898
Look, Jules,
there's two ways this plays out--

171
00:14:19,243 --> 00:14:24,482
One is, your research is
potentially genius.

172
00:14:26,362 --> 00:14:27,362
And the other,

173
00:14:28,473 --> 00:14:31,833
you're raising
some very serious ethical questions,

174
00:14:32,926 --> 00:14:34,803
maybe even criminal concerns...

175
00:14:36,928 --> 00:14:39,036
but if you collaborate with me,

176
00:14:41,061 --> 00:14:42,746
based on my reputation,

177
00:14:44,134 --> 00:14:47,986
all this is viewed
as cutting edge science.

178
00:14:48,571 --> 00:14:53,106
And we will win prizes
and drink Champagne

179
00:14:54,676 --> 00:14:56,707
and do a lot of good for people.

180
00:15:07,042 --> 00:15:09,285
Why don't I give you some time
to think about it?

181
00:15:30,284 --> 00:15:31,284
Ben's awake.

182
00:15:33,539 --> 00:15:34,539
How?

183
00:15:35,103 --> 00:15:38,502
Shephard says he's a spinal surgeon,
not an anesthesiologist.

184
00:15:41,113 --> 00:15:42,509
Ben's asking for you.

185
00:15:52,578 --> 00:15:55,746
This a hobby of yours, underdog,
digging holes?

186
00:15:55,931 --> 00:15:58,521
Yep, that and basket weaving.

187
00:15:58,688 --> 00:15:59,688
Want one?

188
00:16:01,439 --> 00:16:03,201
Happen to have a tunnel to the mainland?

189
00:16:03,346 --> 00:16:04,665
No, but I've got a boat.

190
00:16:06,696 --> 00:16:07,729
Can we use it?

191
00:16:07,803 --> 00:16:09,672
Yeah, but we've got to hurry.

192
00:16:09,815 --> 00:16:11,105
Hold on a second, sister.

193
00:16:11,316 --> 00:16:14,273
You just happen to find us in the woods,
you just happen to have a boat,

194
00:16:14,282 --> 00:16:15,997
and you're gonna let us use it, huh?

195
00:16:17,621 --> 00:16:19,220
There's something we need to do first.

196
00:16:19,278 --> 00:16:20,333
Oh, gee...

197
00:16:20,391 --> 00:16:22,143
My boyfriend is being held prisoner.

198
00:16:22,829 --> 00:16:24,586
If you help me rescue him,
I promise you,

199
00:16:24,663 --> 00:16:26,416
I'll get you back to the other island.

200
00:16:27,327 --> 00:16:30,794
Your boyfriend--
his name happen to be Karl?

201
00:16:33,942 --> 00:16:34,942
Yeah.

202
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:37,908
Ah, come on.

203
00:16:42,459 --> 00:16:43,720
I stopped the surgery.

204
00:16:44,010 --> 00:16:45,010
I know.

205
00:16:46,819 --> 00:16:49,602
I've been able to hear you
for a few minutes now.

206
00:16:51,373 --> 00:16:52,961
It's very clever of you.

207
00:16:53,632 --> 00:16:55,297
I should have seen it coming.

208
00:16:57,983 --> 00:16:58,983
Are you in pain?

209
00:16:58,985 --> 00:17:00,584
- I can...
- No.

210
00:17:01,837 --> 00:17:03,579
But thanks all the same.

211
00:17:17,472 --> 00:17:20,813
I'd like to speak to Juliet alone,
please, Jack.

212
00:17:20,925 --> 00:17:22,590
No, I'm sorry.

213
00:17:22,727 --> 00:17:28,379
Please, I'm asking you...
one gentleman to another.

214
00:17:30,254 --> 00:17:32,343
It won't hurt you to give me 3 minutes,

215
00:17:32,751 --> 00:17:33,751
will it...

216
00:17:35,204 --> 00:17:37,948
Knowing I have only 27 left?

217
00:17:52,152 --> 00:17:53,153
If you touch him,

218
00:17:53,211 --> 00:17:54,521
- if you try to--
- I won't.

219
00:17:59,246 --> 00:18:00,584
You've got three minutes.

220
00:18:25,201 --> 00:18:27,040
I'm Tom, by the way.

221
00:18:48,423 --> 00:18:49,799
They've got history.

222
00:19:07,924 --> 00:19:09,878
I would like for you to go back
in there,

223
00:19:10,174 --> 00:19:12,051
put Ben under and finish the surgery.

224
00:19:14,936 --> 00:19:16,621
And why would I want to do that?

225
00:19:17,737 --> 00:19:20,057
Because I'm going to go help
your friends escape.

226
00:19:30,031 --> 00:19:33,324
Thank you for taking the time
to let us make our pitch, Dr. Burke.

227
00:19:33,605 --> 00:19:36,156
Mittelos Bioscience is based in Oregon.

228
00:19:36,238 --> 00:19:37,759
We're just outside of Portland.

229
00:19:41,723 --> 00:19:43,689
These shots might seem a little,
uh, cheeseball,

230
00:19:43,723 --> 00:19:45,827
but our people really are this happy.

231
00:19:46,336 --> 00:19:48,628
Now why? Because we're privately funded.

232
00:19:48,683 --> 00:19:50,811
Privately funded means freedom.

233
00:19:53,836 --> 00:19:57,427
We organize trips every week
in and around the Portland area,

234
00:19:57,490 --> 00:20:01,621
which is just awesome for hiking
and biking and river running.

235
00:20:03,986 --> 00:20:05,257
Look, when you--

236
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:08,450
your company reached out to me,
I was flattered,

237
00:20:08,508 --> 00:20:10,751
but I don't really know
why you would want me to--

238
00:20:10,854 --> 00:20:15,207
Is it true that you successfully
impregnated a male field mouse?

239
00:20:16,966 --> 00:20:18,496
It didn't carry to term.

240
00:20:20,870 --> 00:20:22,285
Mind if I ask you something?

241
00:20:22,424 --> 00:20:23,424
Sure.

242
00:20:27,528 --> 00:20:28,528
What do you see?

243
00:20:32,461 --> 00:20:34,435
It's a human womb, obviously.

244
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:37,158
Judging from the decomposition
of the endometrium,

245
00:20:37,178 --> 00:20:39,772
I would say
that the woman was somewhere in her 70s.

246
00:20:39,875 --> 00:20:41,435
No, actually, she's 26.

247
00:20:43,073 --> 00:20:44,073
What happened to her?

248
00:20:44,223 --> 00:20:47,748
What if I told you that you could have
complete freedom and money to find out?

249
00:20:50,132 --> 00:20:52,028
We think you're special, Dr. Burke,

250
00:20:52,284 --> 00:20:53,933
and we want you to lead a team

251
00:20:54,010 --> 00:20:57,130
of highly trained people
because we think you're just that good.

252
00:20:58,402 --> 00:20:59,402
I can't.

253
00:21:00,808 --> 00:21:01,808
Why can't you?

254
00:21:02,764 --> 00:21:04,800
My ex-husband wouldn't let me. I--

255
00:21:04,839 --> 00:21:06,731
He wouldn't want you to have
this opportunity?

256
00:21:06,788 --> 00:21:09,485
He doesn't want me to have anything.
He would never give the okay.

257
00:21:09,524 --> 00:21:10,808
Maybe we could reach out to him

258
00:21:10,884 --> 00:21:12,385
- on your behalf--
- Don't bother.

259
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:14,459
There must be something
that he would respond to.

260
00:21:14,498 --> 00:21:17,377
If he were hit by a bus--
How about that? That would work.

261
00:21:21,531 --> 00:21:22,970
That was totally inappropriate.

262
00:21:23,028 --> 00:21:24,843
- No, no--
- No, I, uh...

263
00:21:26,751 --> 00:21:28,455
I'm sorry that I wasted your time.

264
00:21:29,297 --> 00:21:31,964
- Dr. Burke, please, you--
- No, I'm sorry.

265
00:21:32,777 --> 00:21:35,463
Whatever you think I am, I'm not.

266
00:21:36,632 --> 00:21:38,894
I'm not a leader, Mr. Alpert.

267
00:21:39,904 --> 00:21:40,964
I'm a mess.

268
00:22:25,402 --> 00:22:26,402
Well, hell.

269
00:22:38,275 --> 00:22:39,566
Karl's gotta be in there.

270
00:22:40,373 --> 00:22:41,769
What, you mean you ain't sure?

271
00:22:42,777 --> 00:22:44,500
It's the only place I haven't looked.

272
00:22:45,078 --> 00:22:46,078
You know the guard?

273
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,806
Yeah. His name's Aldo.

274
00:22:52,047 --> 00:22:53,404
Okay, Lollipop,

275
00:22:53,544 --> 00:22:56,866
you wanna tell me how we're gonna
get by him with one gun and no bullets?

276
00:22:57,003 --> 00:22:58,003
I've got an idea.

277
00:22:59,435 --> 00:23:00,600
Of course you do.

278
00:23:02,787 --> 00:23:03,855
Open the door!

279
00:23:04,538 --> 00:23:06,291
Alex? What the hell are you doing?

280
00:23:06,549 --> 00:23:09,392
They must've gotten out of their cages.
I caught them in the jungle.

281
00:23:09,489 --> 00:23:10,502
Now open up, Aldo!

282
00:23:10,541 --> 00:23:13,180
Just stop!
You're not supposed to be here.

283
00:23:13,218 --> 00:23:15,029
If your dad finds out,
he's gonna kill me.

284
00:23:15,048 --> 00:23:17,957
My dad was the one who told me
to bring them here, to you.

285
00:23:19,288 --> 00:23:20,896
Look, maybe you should call him.

286
00:23:21,091 --> 00:23:22,968
I'm sure he's got nothing better to do.

287
00:23:30,605 --> 00:23:32,135
Danny, I need Ben.

288
00:23:34,310 --> 00:23:35,310
Why?!

289
00:23:35,361 --> 00:23:36,361
Listen, I got Alex here.

290
00:23:36,370 --> 00:23:38,132
She's got Austen and Ford with her--

291
00:23:40,224 --> 00:23:42,420
Damn it, whatever she says,
don't believe it.

292
00:23:42,772 --> 00:23:44,668
You hold 'em right there. I'm on my--

293
00:23:45,628 --> 00:23:47,794
Don't get mad at me
just 'cause you were dumb enough

294
00:23:47,837 --> 00:23:49,926
to fall for the old
"wookiee prisoner" gag.

295
00:23:50,237 --> 00:23:51,237
Where's Karl?

296
00:23:51,436 --> 00:23:53,332
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

297
00:23:53,614 --> 00:23:54,740
Shoot him in the knee.

298
00:23:56,550 --> 00:23:58,086
- What?
- Give me the rifle.

299
00:23:58,143 --> 00:23:59,876
We don't have time for this. I'll do it.

300
00:24:01,552 --> 00:24:03,879
Okay, all right!
He's at the end of the hall, room 23.

301
00:24:03,952 --> 00:24:05,386
Keys are in my back pocket.

302
00:24:11,814 --> 00:24:13,011
Damn good con, Freckles.

303
00:24:13,050 --> 00:24:14,976
I almost believed
you were gonna shoot that boy.

304
00:24:15,014 --> 00:24:16,035
It wasn't a con.

305
00:24:17,105 --> 00:24:18,173
Here it is!

306
00:25:22,429 --> 00:25:23,450
Sawyer!

307
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:24,944
Help!

308
00:25:26,108 --> 00:25:27,245
Help!

309
00:25:51,603 --> 00:25:53,485
- Is he okay?
- We got your boyfriend back.

310
00:25:53,505 --> 00:25:54,660
Now where's your damn boat?

311
00:26:00,363 --> 00:26:01,365
Idiot!

312
00:26:01,488 --> 00:26:03,183
- Where are they?
- I don't know.

313
00:26:03,511 --> 00:26:05,145
- Alex was with them.
- Danny!

314
00:26:07,905 --> 00:26:08,905
We're letting them go.

315
00:26:09,508 --> 00:26:11,209
- Letting them go?
- Ben gave the order.

316
00:26:11,210 --> 00:26:13,309
- Ben's in surgery. I was just there.
- He woke up.

317
00:26:13,361 --> 00:26:15,774
- Oh, he woke up, huh?
- Shephard won't finish the surgery

318
00:26:15,813 --> 00:26:17,816
unless he knows his friends
are off the island.

319
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:19,354
Do you want Ben to die?

320
00:26:20,079 --> 00:26:22,996
I know Ben would rather die
than let them go.

321
00:26:40,543 --> 00:26:41,630
How was the interview?

322
00:26:43,386 --> 00:26:44,616
It's not for me.

323
00:26:45,245 --> 00:26:46,864
- What?
- It's fine.

324
00:26:47,462 --> 00:26:49,918
They're too far away, anyway.
It's Portland.

325
00:26:49,948 --> 00:26:51,748
Jules, you didn't say no
because of me?

326
00:26:51,814 --> 00:26:54,260
Well, why would I wanna go
all the way to Portland

327
00:26:54,309 --> 00:26:56,205
for research that doesn't even work?

328
00:26:58,657 --> 00:26:59,802
Because it does work.

329
00:27:07,173 --> 00:27:08,173
I'm pregnant.

330
00:27:12,878 --> 00:27:14,736
I'm pre-- I'm pregnant.

331
00:27:16,584 --> 00:27:17,709
What?

332
00:27:17,821 --> 00:27:20,480
Look, look. I took a blood test, too.

333
00:27:21,093 --> 00:27:23,009
I didn't want to tell you
until I was sure.

334
00:27:26,554 --> 00:27:28,181
- It worked.
- Yeah.

335
00:27:35,776 --> 00:27:38,501
All my life, all I've ever wanted
was to have a baby,

336
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:40,226
and now, because of you, I'm gonna...

337
00:27:45,733 --> 00:27:47,967
God, now I just need to get healthy.

338
00:27:49,747 --> 00:27:51,794
Now I just need--
I just need to get healthy

339
00:27:51,871 --> 00:27:55,184
so I can see the little bugger
get into an ivy league school, you know?

340
00:27:55,272 --> 00:27:57,361
You will. Of course you will.

341
00:27:58,367 --> 00:28:01,396
Hey, now you can tell
that bastard ex-husband of yours

342
00:28:01,397 --> 00:28:03,159
what he can do with his ethics.

343
00:28:07,608 --> 00:28:10,371
Because you're insufferable,
and you're mean.

344
00:28:11,614 --> 00:28:14,088
Well, you asked me for the truth, mom,
and that's--

345
00:28:16,929 --> 00:28:18,470
Let me call you later, okay?

346
00:28:20,541 --> 00:28:22,283
Hello, Jules. What's up?

347
00:28:22,794 --> 00:28:23,794
She's pregnant.

348
00:28:24,889 --> 00:28:25,955
Excuse me?

349
00:28:26,061 --> 00:28:28,105
It worked. Rachel's pregnant.

350
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,904
Julie, that's...

351
00:28:36,713 --> 00:28:38,841
I need, uh, I need to see your labs.

352
00:28:38,961 --> 00:28:40,857
We'll have to verify the data before--

353
00:28:40,923 --> 00:28:41,923
No.

354
00:28:42,778 --> 00:28:44,886
I'm not interested in publishing, Ed.

355
00:28:46,138 --> 00:28:47,138
It's my sister.

356
00:28:47,793 --> 00:28:51,057
Fine, then if you're not interested,
why are you concerned if--

357
00:29:11,171 --> 00:29:12,171
You okay?

358
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:13,420
Yeah.

359
00:29:14,722 --> 00:29:16,368
I just don't like blood too much.

360
00:29:17,629 --> 00:29:18,629
Well...

361
00:29:19,038 --> 00:29:21,801
then you probably
won't wanna be looking at that.

362
00:29:25,839 --> 00:29:28,660
So, uh,
if you really can get off the island,

363
00:29:28,748 --> 00:29:30,683
why didn't you
just take him to a facility?

364
00:29:31,148 --> 00:29:32,148
Why all this?

365
00:29:32,954 --> 00:29:36,006
Because ever since
the sky turned purple, we--

366
00:29:37,561 --> 00:29:38,706
What the hell happened?!

367
00:29:39,914 --> 00:29:41,194
I just nicked an artery.

368
00:29:41,694 --> 00:29:43,216
Isn't that what you already did?!

369
00:29:43,423 --> 00:29:45,878
Yeah, well, that was on purpose.

370
00:29:47,118 --> 00:29:48,417
Can you fix it?

371
00:29:49,689 --> 00:29:50,689
Damn it.

372
00:29:57,084 --> 00:29:58,270
- You got him?
- I got him.

373
00:30:01,351 --> 00:30:02,351
Nice ride!

374
00:30:02,844 --> 00:30:04,395
- Help me.
- We gotta go now, okay?

375
00:30:05,251 --> 00:30:06,251
Can you stand?

376
00:30:06,848 --> 00:30:08,109
All right, come on.

377
00:30:11,162 --> 00:30:14,253
So... you're the boss' daughter, huh?

378
00:30:15,670 --> 00:30:16,989
Never saw that coming.

379
00:30:18,222 --> 00:30:19,290
Let's go, Cheech.

380
00:30:19,859 --> 00:30:21,211
We're goin' for a little ride.

381
00:30:22,514 --> 00:30:24,709
- Careful.
- All right, easy.

382
00:30:25,855 --> 00:30:27,810
I'm gonna put you in the boat,
all right?

383
00:30:28,986 --> 00:30:29,986
Wait, wait.

384
00:30:33,075 --> 00:30:34,691
- You're gonna be okay.
- Danny...

385
00:30:34,692 --> 00:30:35,837
No, Sawyer.

386
00:30:37,150 --> 00:30:38,150
Danny!

387
00:31:10,701 --> 00:31:12,334
- What happened? Is he--
- I can't see.

388
00:31:12,407 --> 00:31:13,607
- What?
- I can't see.

389
00:31:13,608 --> 00:31:14,676
There's too much blood.

390
00:31:14,863 --> 00:31:15,970
All right, get over here.

391
00:31:16,518 --> 00:31:19,127
Tom, he's gonna die
if you don't get over here right now.

392
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:24,480
Go.

393
00:31:26,727 --> 00:31:27,727
Get outta here.

394
00:31:29,831 --> 00:31:30,831
You heard the lady.

395
00:31:33,643 --> 00:31:34,643
Let's go.

396
00:31:34,801 --> 00:31:35,938
Not you, Alex.

397
00:31:36,894 --> 00:31:38,771
- You're staying.
- Why?

398
00:31:39,651 --> 00:31:41,008
We both know your father,

399
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:44,445
and the only way he'll let Karl live
is if you're here when he wakes up.

400
00:31:48,665 --> 00:31:50,041
I'm sorry, Alex.

401
00:31:59,224 --> 00:32:00,224
Hey, Alex.

402
00:32:03,387 --> 00:32:04,562
I missed you.

403
00:32:05,635 --> 00:32:06,635
I know.

404
00:32:06,935 --> 00:32:08,042
I missed you, too.

405
00:32:10,899 --> 00:32:12,651
You have to go away now,

406
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:15,347
but I'll see you real soon, okay?

407
00:32:16,697 --> 00:32:17,697
I love you.

408
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:25,560
I have to go to sleep now.

409
00:32:38,134 --> 00:32:39,134
Wait.

410
00:32:42,492 --> 00:32:44,302
Easy. Okay, easy.

411
00:32:48,247 --> 00:32:50,278
- Wait, wait--
- Hold it steady, damn it.

412
00:32:50,346 --> 00:32:51,346
Hold it steady.

413
00:32:55,005 --> 00:32:56,112
<i>Jack, are you there?</i>

414
00:33:01,465 --> 00:33:03,010
All right, hold that up to me.

415
00:33:03,723 --> 00:33:06,141
- The walkie-- Hold it up to me.
- What about the surgery--

416
00:33:06,198 --> 00:33:07,277
Just do it!

417
00:33:14,724 --> 00:33:16,391
Yeah, I'm here, Kate. You okay?

418
00:33:17,335 --> 00:33:19,867
Yeah, I... we've got a boat.

419
00:33:19,943 --> 00:33:21,127
They're letting us go.

420
00:33:21,542 --> 00:33:22,542
Who's letting you go?

421
00:33:24,349 --> 00:33:25,349
The blonde woman.

422
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:27,563
So you're safe, you and Sawyer?

423
00:33:27,698 --> 00:33:28,733
Yes, yeah.

424
00:33:29,655 --> 00:33:30,655
Tell me.

425
00:33:31,558 --> 00:33:32,558
Tell you?

426
00:33:32,864 --> 00:33:34,916
The first day on the beach,
the day of the crash--

427
00:33:34,935 --> 00:33:37,439
The story that I told you--
If you're safe, tell me.

428
00:33:38,095 --> 00:33:40,271
- You think this is the best time--
- Shut up!

429
00:33:43,573 --> 00:33:47,010
You... were doing surgery on a girl...

430
00:33:49,737 --> 00:33:50,737
and you messed up.

431
00:33:51,499 --> 00:33:52,499
You made a mistake.

432
00:33:55,107 --> 00:33:56,869
<i>You tore something on her back,</i>

433
00:33:57,602 --> 00:33:59,190
<i>and all the nerves came loose...</i>

434
00:34:03,316 --> 00:34:05,058
and you said you were so afraid...

435
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,816
and you said the fear was so...

436
00:34:11,925 --> 00:34:15,979
real, and you didn't know what to do...

437
00:34:21,184 --> 00:34:22,571
so you counted to five...

438
00:34:26,548 --> 00:34:28,522
<i>and then you weren't afraid anymore...</i>

439
00:34:30,759 --> 00:34:32,069
<i>and then it was just gone...</i>

440
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:37,768
and you fixed her.

441
00:34:39,521 --> 00:34:40,521
<i>You saved her.</i>

442
00:35:00,271 --> 00:35:02,090
I need you to make me a promise, Kate.

443
00:35:04,013 --> 00:35:06,691
Promise me that
you'll never come back here for me.

444
00:35:09,133 --> 00:35:10,220
Don't come back, Kate.

445
00:35:10,483 --> 00:35:11,686
Jack, where are you--

446
00:35:11,747 --> 00:35:12,763
Turn it off.

447
00:35:13,232 --> 00:35:15,717
<i>Jack? Jack, please, where are--</i>

448
00:35:28,816 --> 00:35:30,048
Trades are comin' up.

449
00:35:32,618 --> 00:35:33,618
We gotta go.

450
00:35:38,123 --> 00:35:39,123
- Let's go.
- Okay.

451
00:36:29,342 --> 00:36:31,441
We have some paperwork
that we need you to sign,

452
00:36:32,314 --> 00:36:34,121
but take your time. There's no rush.

453
00:36:34,566 --> 00:36:35,566
Thank you.

454
00:37:38,756 --> 00:37:40,691
Were you able to remove the tumor?

455
00:37:44,466 --> 00:37:45,466
Yeah.

456
00:37:49,780 --> 00:37:52,524
You'll want to do a biopsy,
see if it's malignant.

457
00:37:58,287 --> 00:38:01,262
So what now, I just go back to my cell?

458
00:38:02,917 --> 00:38:04,785
Until they figure out
what to do with you.

459
00:38:09,651 --> 00:38:10,651
"They"...

460
00:38:16,495 --> 00:38:17,495
What did he say?

461
00:38:18,744 --> 00:38:19,744
I'm sorry?

462
00:38:20,043 --> 00:38:24,242
Ben-- What did he say
that made you want to save his life?

463
00:38:29,292 --> 00:38:31,034
It doesn't really matter what he said.

464
00:38:31,450 --> 00:38:32,586
It matters to me.

465
00:38:34,497 --> 00:38:37,838
After everything
that I have been put through,

466
00:38:39,456 --> 00:38:40,852
you owe me an answer.

467
00:38:42,692 --> 00:38:44,002
And I wanna know what he said.

468
00:39:03,985 --> 00:39:05,025
Tissue?

469
00:39:05,943 --> 00:39:08,302
Thank you. Thanks.

470
00:39:19,362 --> 00:39:20,362
Have we met?

471
00:39:20,467 --> 00:39:21,959
Hello, Dr. Burke.

472
00:39:25,037 --> 00:39:28,929
- Mr. Alpert?
- I'm, so sorry for your loss.

473
00:39:31,499 --> 00:39:32,678
What are you doing here?

474
00:39:33,203 --> 00:39:35,196
I saw what happened on the news,

475
00:39:35,455 --> 00:39:37,520
end, uh, your office said
you were down here.

476
00:39:37,616 --> 00:39:40,313
I just wanted to express my condolences
in person

477
00:39:41,007 --> 00:39:42,490
before I went back up to Portland.

478
00:39:42,608 --> 00:39:44,618
This is Ethan.
He's one of my colleagues.

479
00:39:44,775 --> 00:39:46,132
It's a pleasure to meet you.

480
00:39:53,446 --> 00:39:54,726
He was hit by a bus.

481
00:39:55,452 --> 00:39:57,796
I know. They say
you were there when it happened.

482
00:39:57,946 --> 00:40:01,634
- It must have been--
- No, no, in our interview,

483
00:40:03,005 --> 00:40:04,731
I said-- I said that I wanted--

484
00:40:04,857 --> 00:40:06,638
I wanted him to get hit by a bus.

485
00:40:09,564 --> 00:40:13,040
Dr. Burke, I realize
you're a little shook up right now,

486
00:40:13,176 --> 00:40:15,015
but this is just a tragic accident.

487
00:40:15,276 --> 00:40:16,518
You can'blame yourself.

488
00:40:17,726 --> 00:40:19,738
I don't even rember you saying that.

489
00:40:25,090 --> 00:40:26,688
Why are you here, Mr. Alpert?

490
00:40:27,692 --> 00:40:28,692
Look, uh...

491
00:40:29,502 --> 00:40:31,302
I know the timing is horrible,

492
00:40:31,397 --> 00:40:34,102
but we came because we're that serious

493
00:40:34,152 --> 00:40:36,068
about getting you to come work with us.

494
00:40:38,666 --> 00:40:40,351
Just give us six months.

495
00:40:40,857 --> 00:40:43,746
If you need to, you'll be back
before your sister gives birth.

496
00:40:46,719 --> 00:40:48,838
- How did you know that my--
- Well, we're very...

497
00:40:48,972 --> 00:40:50,667
thorough in our recruitment process.

498
00:41:00,988 --> 00:41:02,210
Can my sister come?

499
00:41:02,912 --> 00:41:04,612
Won't work. We're pretty remote.

500
00:41:04,914 --> 00:41:07,427
She wouldn't have access
to the treatment that she needs.

501
00:41:08,114 --> 00:41:09,121
But it's Portland.

502
00:41:09,122 --> 00:41:11,442
- There's plenty of clinics and--
- Well, actually,

503
00:41:11,824 --> 00:41:13,432
we're not quite in Portland.

504
00:41:24,901 --> 00:41:26,220
I wanna know what he said.

505
00:41:32,805 --> 00:41:35,693
I've been on this island
for three years, Jack--

506
00:41:36,811 --> 00:41:40,171
3 years, 2 months and 28 days.

507
00:41:44,018 --> 00:41:45,722
He said that if I...

508
00:41:48,025 --> 00:41:49,025
let him live...

509
00:41:51,589 --> 00:41:52,589
and I helped you...

510
00:41:58,851 --> 00:42:01,383
that he would finally let me go home.
