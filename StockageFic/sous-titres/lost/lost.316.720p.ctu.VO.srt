<i>Previously on</i> Lost...

2
00:00:01,813 --> 00:00:02,797
We think you're special.

3
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:05,437
We want you to lead a team
of highly trained people.

4
00:00:05,578 --> 00:00:06,565
How was the interview?

5
00:00:06,604 --> 00:00:08,850
Why I'd want to go
all the way to Portland

6
00:00:08,950 --> 00:00:10,850
for research that doesn't even work?

7
00:00:11,350 --> 00:00:13,450
Because it does work.
I'm pregnant.

8
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:17,131
My whole life, all I've ever
wanted was to have a baby.

9
00:00:17,189 --> 00:00:18,559
and now because of you, I can.

10
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:20,501
I know that you don't care,

11
00:00:20,578 --> 00:00:23,607
but the people I spent the last
three years of my life with...

12
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:25,150
they just left me.

13
00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:26,455
You okay?

14
00:00:26,950 --> 00:00:29,150
- She is not coming with us.
- Yes, she is.

15
00:00:29,601 --> 00:00:31,450
- Why?
- They left her behind, too.

16
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:08,750
It's getting late.

17
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:11,250
This is a good place to make camp.

18
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:20,750
- I'll get some firewood.
- I'll go with you.

19
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:47,650
Do you wanna talk about it?

20
00:01:49,450 --> 00:01:50,550
Talk about what?

21
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:54,950
About the week
you spent over there with them.

22
00:01:57,683 --> 00:01:58,750
Well, after you left,

23
00:01:59,150 --> 00:02:00,302
I'd...

24
00:02:01,485 --> 00:02:03,621
I'd made a deal with them...
If I took care of Ben,

25
00:02:03,758 --> 00:02:05,205
that they'd let me off the island.

26
00:02:05,243 --> 00:02:07,150
I don't know.
I just kept my head down,

27
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:08,550
did what I was supposed to,

28
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:11,250
and I didn't ask any questions.

29
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:15,350
And that's it?

30
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:18,650
That's it.

31
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:40,642
Okay. Let's have it.

32
00:02:43,850 --> 00:02:46,250
I want to know what you people
are doing on this island,

33
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:48,350
why you're terrorizing us,

34
00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:51,750
making lists, kidnapping children.

35
00:02:53,450 --> 00:02:55,250
I want to know everything.

36
00:02:56,850 --> 00:02:58,750
But the first thing
I'd like to know is...

37
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:01,450
Who are you?

38
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:19,933
Hi. I'm Juliet Burke.
'm with Mittelos Bioscience.

39
00:03:19,991 --> 00:03:22,441
- I'll let Mr. Alpert know you're here.
- Thank you.

40
00:03:27,185 --> 00:03:29,551
I think they're taking this whole
"corporate secrecy" thing

41
00:03:29,609 --> 00:03:30,850
a little too seriously.

42
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:33,037
I'm never gonna fit in
with these people.

43
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:37,450
Hey there, Dr. Burke.

44
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:39,358
If you pop the trunk,
I'll get your bags.

45
00:03:39,359 --> 00:03:40,421
Thank you.

46
00:03:46,629 --> 00:03:47,950
You managed to find us.

47
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:49,959
I didn't even know
they had an airport out here.

48
00:03:49,997 --> 00:03:51,250
I know. It surprises everyone.

49
00:03:51,301 --> 00:03:52,729
Hi. You must be Rachel.

50
00:03:53,231 --> 00:03:55,150
- Richard Alpert.
- Nice to meet you.

51
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:57,981
Thank you for letting us
borrow your sister for a few months.

52
00:03:58,039 --> 00:04:00,161
Just promise me
you'll bring her back in one piece.

53
00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:01,550
Well, we'll do our best.

54
00:04:02,597 --> 00:04:05,250
So listen, it's a...
A security thing, you know?

55
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:08,108
We have to take you in
the rest of the way, so...

56
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:09,213
Whenever you're ready,

57
00:04:09,251 --> 00:04:11,807
we'll be waiting right over here,
but please take your time.

58
00:04:12,063 --> 00:04:13,085
Pleasure to meet you.

59
00:04:13,179 --> 00:04:14,240
Thanks. Thank you.

60
00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:22,950
It's better this way.

61
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:24,550
Is this a mistake?

62
00:04:24,992 --> 00:04:26,882
I shouldn't go.
What if you get sick again?

63
00:04:26,883 --> 00:04:28,250
I won't. The cancer's gone,

64
00:04:29,292 --> 00:04:32,350
and I'm 100% preggers, thanks to you.

65
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:35,150
- I'll be back... - Yes, I know.

66
00:04:35,209 --> 00:04:36,675
Before you give birth. I promise.

67
00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:38,982
I know. Don't worry about us, okay?

68
00:04:41,450 --> 00:04:43,861
You spent your whole life
working to get here, so...

69
00:04:44,882 --> 00:04:45,886
don't blow it.

70
00:04:49,735 --> 00:04:51,317
- I love you. - I love you.

71
00:05:00,845 --> 00:05:02,137
Go make us proud.

72
00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:19,550
Who are you?

73
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:26,906
If I told you who I was,

74
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:30,150
if I told you everything that I know,

75
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:32,050
you'd kill me.

76
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:36,050
What do you think I'll do if you don't?

77
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:39,350
Leave her alone.

78
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:46,150
Sooner or later,
she'll answer my questions.

79
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:49,317
She'll answer your questions
when she's ready,

80
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:51,950
and you'll wait until she is.

81
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:55,350
She's under my protection.

Transcript: FRM - Presync: kevinvan
Resynchro: Sixe

83
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:57,860
What is it?

84
00:06:58,439 --> 00:07:01,043
It's okay. Shush. I know.

85
00:07:07,314 --> 00:07:08,318
You okay?

86
00:07:11,779 --> 00:07:13,000
What's going on?

87
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,600
- Didn't you hear Aaron? - Is he okay?

88
00:07:15,639 --> 00:07:17,340
No, he's okay, he's okay.

89
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:18,941
Are you all right?

90
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,227
Yeah, I just...

91
00:07:20,823 --> 00:07:22,082
feel a little bit off.

92
00:07:22,552 --> 00:07:23,800
I didn't sleep well.

93
00:07:23,865 --> 00:07:25,943
I can't believe
I didn't hear him crying.

94
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,665
Maybe you're coming down
with something.

95
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:29,900
But why don't you let me take Aaron,

96
00:07:30,257 --> 00:07:31,858
and you get some more rest?

97
00:07:32,572 --> 00:07:34,383
- Yeah, do you mind? - Absolutely.

98
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,600
I won't sleep... long.

99
00:07:51,492 --> 00:07:53,800
I guess it's no use asking them
to wait up, huh?

100
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,600
They'll come around.
Just give them some time.

101
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:01,454
My people kept Sayid chained
to a swing set for three days.

102
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:03,070
Then I dragged Kate into the jungle,

103
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:04,978
handcuffed myself to her
and lied about it.

104
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,130
How much time do you think they need?

105
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:11,800
We'll be back to our beach
a couple hours.

106
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:13,418
They'll probably be over it by then.

107
00:08:16,706 --> 00:08:17,883
You nervous?

108
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:19,300
Hell, yes.

109
00:08:22,961 --> 00:08:25,600
I know that six months sounds
like an eternity,

110
00:08:25,655 --> 00:08:28,500
but you're gonna be amazed
at how time flies once you're there.

111
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,467
I can't wait to find out
where "there" is.

112
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,119
Dr. Burke, wanna have a seat?

113
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:34,830
I'd like to take some of your vitals,

114
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:37,000
if that's okay with you.

115
00:08:37,243 --> 00:08:39,100
Yeah, sure.

116
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,900
Everyone at the company
is really excited

117
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,600
about you coming down, Dr. Burke,

118
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:48,131
and I think your research

119
00:08:48,208 --> 00:08:50,400
is really gonna have
a major impact on us.

120
00:09:00,085 --> 00:09:02,323
- What is that?
- That is orange juice

121
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:04,900
with a considerable amount
of tranquilizer mixed in.

122
00:09:06,648 --> 00:09:07,700
You want me to drink it?

123
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:10,500
Oh, yes. You're gonna want to be asleep
for the trip, Dr. Burke.

124
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,300
It can be kind of intense.

125
00:09:15,588 --> 00:09:17,700
I was fine with signing
all of your paperwork,

126
00:09:17,813 --> 00:09:19,620
fine with agreeing to <I>not</I> talk

127
00:09:19,698 --> 00:09:21,300
to anyone in my life for six months,

128
00:09:21,571 --> 00:09:23,771
fine with the fact that no one
in the medical community

129
00:09:23,772 --> 00:09:25,369
has ever heard of Mittelos Bioscience...

130
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:26,554
Why were you fine?

131
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:29,900
- What?
- Why were you fine with those things?

132
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,812
It seems like quite a leap
for a job opportunity,

133
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,480
and we're not paying you <I>that</I> much.

134
00:09:38,118 --> 00:09:41,435
I think you're fine because deep down,
a part of you knows

135
00:09:42,013 --> 00:09:44,136
that the place we're taking you to
is special.

136
00:09:46,341 --> 00:09:47,500
Special, huh?

137
00:09:48,248 --> 00:09:49,800
Let me ask you something, Juliet.

138
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:54,630
You took a woman... Your own sister...

139
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:58,364
whose reproductive system
was ravaged by chemotherapy,

140
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:01,252
who is sterile,
and you made her pregnant.

141
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:04,354
You created life
where life wasn't supposed to be.

142
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,200
That's a gift, Juliet.

143
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:09,200
You have a gift.

144
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:13,300
Now don't you feel you're meant
to do something significant with it?

145
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:19,500
Where we're going, you can do just that.

146
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:23,752
Where exactly are we going?

147
00:10:23,791 --> 00:10:25,006
I can't tell you that,

148
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:27,830
but what I <I>can</I> tell you is that...

149
00:10:28,314 --> 00:10:29,900
you'll see things there

150
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,425
that you never imagined.

151
00:10:35,531 --> 00:10:37,700
Now no one is forcing you
to do anything,

152
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:40,547
so if you change your mind,
we're happy to take you back to...

153
00:10:49,113 --> 00:10:51,600
You probably
shouldn't have drunk that so fast.

154
00:11:10,413 --> 00:11:11,600
Good morning.

155
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,800
No, no, it's okay.
You'll be hoarse for a few hours,

156
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:17,500
but it gets better as the day goes on.

157
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:19,400
Sorry I had to strap you in,

158
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:21,600
but the last leg
is always a little bumpy.

159
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:23,012
Watch your head.

160
00:11:24,614 --> 00:11:25,656
Give me your hand.

161
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:47,700
We're here.

162
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:49,600
Here where?

163
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,300
Hello, Dr. Burke.

164
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:58,800
My name is Benjamin Linus.

165
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:05,096
I'm really looking forward
to working with you.

166
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,300
Watch your step here.

167
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,175
Hey, that's too much water.

168
00:13:20,275 --> 00:13:21,400
It's gonna be all soggy.

169
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,507
It's oatmeal, dude.
It's supposed to be soggy.

170
00:13:24,751 --> 00:13:26,500
Well, if it ain't three men and a baby.

171
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:29,300
I counted Hugo twice.

172
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,300
Oh, what? Come on. I used your name.

173
00:13:39,476 --> 00:13:41,300
Does anybody know
where there's any aspirin?

174
00:13:41,325 --> 00:13:42,600
Claire, you don't look so good.

175
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:44,903
What are you doing up?
You're meant to be in bed.

176
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:46,906
Yeah, no, I know.

177
00:13:47,639 --> 00:13:48,740
My head is pounding.

178
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:51,142
I got you covered.
Two aspirin coming right up.

179
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:52,700
Thank you.

180
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:05,100
Son of a bitch.

181
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:11,476
Jack! It's Jack!

182
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,498
Come on! Come on! It's Jack!

183
00:14:22,191 --> 00:14:23,194
It's Jack.

184
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,800
What the hell is she doing here?

185
00:16:06,095 --> 00:16:07,098
So...

186
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,609
You're, like, one of them, huh?

187
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:12,600
I'm Juliet.

188
00:16:15,701 --> 00:16:17,300
I don't remember you from the dock...

189
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,885
Where you put bags on our heads...

190
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:23,029
After you shocked us.

191
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:27,321
I had the day off.

192
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,900
So I hear you're a doctor.

193
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:39,400
I'm really more of a researcher.

194
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:49,665
They send you over here
to keep an eye on me?

195
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:56,100
The last one of you guys
that came over here... Ethan...

196
00:16:59,225 --> 00:17:02,833
He kidnapped Claire,
and Charlie got upset.

197
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:07,700
We buried him over there.

198
00:17:32,454 --> 00:17:34,769
She's gone, Juliet. She's dead.

199
00:17:41,929 --> 00:17:43,994
It's okay. You tried.

200
00:17:50,827 --> 00:17:52,441
Why don't you go ahead and take off?

201
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:55,129
I'll talk to Ben.

202
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,200
It was Sabine's choice to get pregnant.

203
00:18:22,309 --> 00:18:24,200
She knew she was taking a risk.

204
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,400
I think it happens at conception,

205
00:18:28,454 --> 00:18:30,887
and if that's the case,
there's nothing I can do about it,

206
00:18:30,950 --> 00:18:33,200
- at least not here.
- I'm not sure I understand.

207
00:18:33,255 --> 00:18:34,783
The only way to see if I'm right

208
00:18:34,834 --> 00:18:37,200
is to take a woman off the island,
back to Miami.

209
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:39,500
No. You're not taking anybody
off the island.

210
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:47,800
In that case,
there's thing more I can do.

211
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:50,800
I know you put a lot of faith in me,
Ben,

212
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:53,300
and I'm sorry I couldn't help you.

213
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:58,428
My sister's giving birth
in three months...

214
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,700
and I haven't even been able
to call her.

215
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:06,700
It's time for me to go home.

216
00:19:12,942 --> 00:19:15,565
Your sister won't be giving birth
in three months, Juliet.

217
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,100
She'll be dead before then.

218
00:19:21,886 --> 00:19:23,237
Her cancer's back.

219
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:48,842
Where did you get this?

220
00:19:49,015 --> 00:19:51,126
Mikhail. Sorry.
I should have told you sooner.

221
00:19:51,127 --> 00:19:52,829
But I didn't see what good
it would do...

222
00:19:52,850 --> 00:19:54,800
What good it would do?!
Could have gone home!

223
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:56,209
I could have been with her!

224
00:19:56,210 --> 00:19:57,214
You still can.

225
00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:01,151
You can go home, Juliet,
be with her in her final days,

226
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:04,517
or you can stay here
and help me with our problem.

227
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:07,900
Why would I stay?

228
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:10,288
Because if you do,
I will cure your sister's cancer.

229
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,149
I'm supposed to take that on faith?

230
00:20:14,233 --> 00:20:15,549
You've been here for six months.

231
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:17,779
You've done extensive workups
on all of us.

232
00:20:17,813 --> 00:20:20,780
- Have you seen even a trace of cancer?
- That's <i>here!</i>

233
00:20:20,963 --> 00:20:23,993
And being that you won't let me bring
my sister here, I'm gonna need more...

234
00:20:23,994 --> 00:20:25,800
Jacob said
he would take care of it himself.

235
00:20:27,471 --> 00:20:29,548
Unless, of course,
you don't have faith in <i>him.</i>

236
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:33,600
Every woman on this island needs you.

237
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:36,000
If you choose to stay,

238
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:38,100
I promise you,

239
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:40,200
we will save Rachel's life.

240
00:20:47,663 --> 00:20:49,805
Trust her? She's one of them.

241
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:51,500
Not anymore. They left her behind.

242
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:54,051
- Oh, yeah? Where'd they go?
- I told you. I don't know.

243
00:20:54,052 --> 00:20:56,600
- Maybe we better ask her.
- She doesn't know either.

244
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:59,655
Here's a wacky idea.
Let's sic our resident Iraqi on her,

245
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:01,814
let him do what he does,
then see what she says.

246
00:21:01,831 --> 00:21:03,100
I don't do that anymore.

247
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:04,700
Well, ain't that convenient?

248
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:08,231
But I don't trust her, Jack.
If she's so innocent...

249
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,999
why won't she answer our questions?

250
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,659
Just give her some time. She's afraid.

251
00:21:11,726 --> 00:21:12,845
How much time?

252
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:15,259
Look, the fact that I trust her
should be enough.

253
00:21:15,607 --> 00:21:16,794
It's not.

254
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:20,500
Where did Locke go?

255
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:23,486
He went with them,
right after he destroyed the sub...

256
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,546
The sub that was gonna take <i>me</i>
off this island.

257
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,300
- What?
- They were gonna let you go?

258
00:21:28,446 --> 00:21:29,585
Said who?

259
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Ben.

260
00:21:34,319 --> 00:21:36,900
- Whose life you saved.
- Sawyer, lay off.

261
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,892
Shoulda let that bug-eyed bastard die!

262
00:21:38,950 --> 00:21:41,343
- He did it for us.
- Sounds like he did it for him.

263
00:21:42,114 --> 00:21:43,659
Is there something you wanna ask me?

264
00:21:43,698 --> 00:21:45,116
I wanna ask you why you're fighting

265
00:21:45,155 --> 00:21:47,376
every single one of us
and sticking up for one of them?

266
00:21:47,397 --> 00:21:49,134
I spent every moment over there

267
00:21:49,192 --> 00:21:50,757
trying to find a way off this island.

268
00:21:50,950 --> 00:21:52,782
I was trying to help all of us.

269
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,731
I was trying to get us rescued.

270
00:21:57,384 --> 00:21:58,831
Something's wrong with Claire!

271
00:22:00,726 --> 00:22:01,883
Is she okay?

272
00:22:03,127 --> 00:22:04,864
Grab her, grab her.

273
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:06,800
Let's get her up. Let's get her up.

274
00:22:09,093 --> 00:22:10,460
How long has she been like this?

275
00:22:10,537 --> 00:22:12,042
She started feeling bad this morning.

276
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:14,458
Before we got back,
was she showing any symptoms at all?

277
00:22:14,496 --> 00:22:15,519
No, she was fine.

278
00:22:15,891 --> 00:22:17,500
Has she been drinking enough water?

279
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:20,000
- I think so, yeah.
- All right, keep that head up.

280
00:22:22,825 --> 00:22:24,000
What happened to her?

281
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:29,002
He said, "what do <i>you</i> care?"

282
00:22:37,539 --> 00:22:38,700
I need your help.

283
00:22:38,894 --> 00:22:40,300
I need you to go and get Jack.

284
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:43,600
- He's busy right now.
- Please, I have to talk to him.

285
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:45,400
You wanna tell me why you need Jack?

286
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:49,711
Because I think I know
what's wrong with Claire.

287
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:52,400
Why?

288
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:55,400
Because I did it to her.

289
00:23:22,824 --> 00:23:24,600
Giving you a bad feeling
in your stomach?

290
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:30,100
Yeah, me, too.

291
00:23:31,217 --> 00:23:32,949
Claire's immune system
is turning on her.

292
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,200
She's having a latent reaction

293
00:23:34,231 --> 00:23:36,469
- to a medication in her bloodstream.
- What medication?

294
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:39,905
It was designed to keep her alive
during the late stages of her pregnancy.

295
00:23:40,021 --> 00:23:41,105
Designed by who?

296
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:43,900
By me.

297
00:23:44,019 --> 00:23:46,600
For some reason
the women here can't have babies.

298
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,400
The mother's body
turns on the pregnancy,

299
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:51,000
treats it as a foreign invader.

300
00:23:51,173 --> 00:23:53,237
I saw it happen over and over.

301
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:55,900
Every pregnant woman
on this island died...

302
00:23:59,699 --> 00:24:00,741
That is,

303
00:24:00,895 --> 00:24:02,800
every pregnant woman until Claire.

304
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,500
What did you do to her?

305
00:24:08,347 --> 00:24:10,315
One of our people infiltrated your camp

306
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:13,800
and began taking blood samples

307
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,500
right after your plane crashed.

308
00:24:21,424 --> 00:24:23,492
Even though Claire
didn't conceive on this island,

309
00:24:23,530 --> 00:24:26,671
we found that her symptoms
were consistent with previous mothers,

310
00:24:26,748 --> 00:24:28,831
- so we tried to save her life.
- By kidnapping her?

311
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:30,965
No, that wasn't supposed to happen.

312
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:33,407
She was our control case.

313
00:24:34,044 --> 00:24:36,007
I had developed a serum that...

314
00:24:36,393 --> 00:24:38,600
I thought would reverse
what was happening to her.

315
00:24:38,601 --> 00:24:40,890
Ethan was administering the injections.

316
00:24:42,264 --> 00:24:45,082
<i>Then you found out
that he wasn't on the plane.</i>

317
00:24:45,647 --> 00:24:47,600
The census... I interviewed everyone.

318
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:49,264
One of them isn't in the manifest.

319
00:24:49,998 --> 00:24:51,329
He wasn't on the plane.

320
00:24:51,807 --> 00:24:54,500
So... he improvised.

321
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:56,400
Hello there.

322
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:02,800
<i>He kidnapped her on his own.</i>

323
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:04,300
<i>That was never the plan.</i>

324
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,608
Look, I know how this sounds,

325
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:12,500
but without those injections,
Claire would have died.

326
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:16,740
Without the serum,
she's going into a form of withdrawal,

327
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:18,600
and if I don't treat her quickly,

328
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:21,000
her immune system
could shut down entirely.

329
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,721
Jack, I can fix this.

330
00:25:24,223 --> 00:25:25,708
I just need the serum.

331
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,409
Ethan kept a stash of medical supplies
near the caves where you used to live.

332
00:25:29,498 --> 00:25:30,809
If I go right now,

333
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,100
I can be back before it's too late.

334
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:41,500
Do it.

335
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,200
Get moving.

336
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,100
Where are you?

337
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:56,800
In bed... with you.

338
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:04,600
And where <i>were</i> you?

339
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:06,900
I was just realizing...

340
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:11,862
that tomorrow I will have been
on this island for three years.

341
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:19,799
Then I better bake a cake.

342
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:26,300
Stay here.

343
00:26:40,048 --> 00:26:41,167
What have you got there?

344
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:45,400
Karl developed some x-rays for me.

345
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:48,300
What's wrong?

346
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:56,859
Morning, Juliet.

347
00:27:07,051 --> 00:27:08,556
- Hi.
- Can I come in?

348
00:27:09,501 --> 00:27:10,529
Of course.

349
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:14,395
I was just finishing "Carrie."

350
00:27:14,599 --> 00:27:17,451
I still don't know why you picked it,
but, boy, is it depressing.

351
00:27:17,586 --> 00:27:18,724
You have a tumor.

352
00:27:21,329 --> 00:27:22,331
What?

353
00:27:22,332 --> 00:27:25,500
When you told me about your back pain,
I said that I would take some x-rays

354
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:28,300
to see if it was a small fracture
or a herniated disc,

355
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,275
but that's not your problem.

356
00:27:31,976 --> 00:27:35,100
Your problem is a large tumor
surrounding your l4 vertebra.

357
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:48,800
You're surprised.

358
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:52,208
You've just told me that I have cancer.
Of course I'm surprised.

359
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:54,200
No, I told you that you had a tumor.

360
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:05,243
- Why are you scared?
- I'm not scared.

361
00:28:05,597 --> 00:28:07,642
Why are you scared, Ben?

362
00:28:07,862 --> 00:28:10,200
You said no one on this island
ever had cancer.

363
00:28:10,231 --> 00:28:12,125
- You told me that...
- I know what I told you.

364
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:13,468
You told me you could fix it.

365
00:28:13,526 --> 00:28:16,246
You said that you cured my sister.
You lied to me.

366
00:28:16,305 --> 00:28:17,347
No, I did not lie to you.

367
00:28:17,424 --> 00:28:19,489
If you can cure cancer,
then why do you have it?

368
00:28:22,729 --> 00:28:23,809
I don't know.

369
00:28:25,273 --> 00:28:27,572
I wanna talk to her.
I wanna talk to Rachel.

370
00:28:27,649 --> 00:28:29,435
I wanna talk to her now!

371
00:28:29,512 --> 00:28:31,061
That's not gonna happen, Juliet,

372
00:28:31,158 --> 00:28:33,010
but I can promise you
that Rachel is fine.

373
00:28:33,108 --> 00:28:35,037
- You never cured her!
- I did!

374
00:28:35,114 --> 00:28:36,889
- You're a liar!
- No, Juliet...

375
00:28:36,947 --> 00:28:39,000
- You lied to me!
- I told you the truth!

376
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:48,275
I gave you my word.

377
00:28:55,388 --> 00:28:56,565
I know.

378
00:29:03,213 --> 00:29:04,448
I wanna go home.

379
00:29:05,115 --> 00:29:07,218
I wanna go home, Ben. Please.

380
00:29:08,607 --> 00:29:11,077
Can't you please just let me go home?

381
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:16,929
No.

382
00:29:53,171 --> 00:29:54,450
Step away from the case!

383
00:29:56,850 --> 00:29:58,650
- Listen to me, Sayid...
- Step back.

384
00:30:01,755 --> 00:30:04,283
It's full of medical supplies.
They're for Claire.

385
00:30:04,553 --> 00:30:05,638
Jack knows all about it.

386
00:30:05,677 --> 00:30:07,346
Jack ain't here right now, is he?

387
00:30:12,740 --> 00:30:14,110
I'm telling you the truth.

388
00:30:14,232 --> 00:30:16,614
You said earlier if you told me
everything you knew,

389
00:30:17,410 --> 00:30:18,505
I'd kill you.

390
00:30:20,670 --> 00:30:22,947
I'm going to test
the validity of that statement.

391
00:30:23,024 --> 00:30:24,191
He means, "talk."

392
00:30:24,682 --> 00:30:26,077
We don't have time for this.

393
00:30:26,173 --> 00:30:27,505
We cleared our schedules.

394
00:30:28,338 --> 00:30:29,873
We got all the time in the world.

395
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:38,024
You know, it's interesting...

396
00:30:38,846 --> 00:30:41,494
that you two are now
the camp's moral police.

397
00:30:44,308 --> 00:30:46,314
I'm curious, Sayid.

398
00:30:48,001 --> 00:30:50,621
How long was it before
you told everyone on that beach

399
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:53,421
exactly how many people
you've tortured in your life?

400
00:30:55,578 --> 00:30:57,139
Do they know about Basra?

401
00:31:00,789 --> 00:31:04,518
And I'm sure the first thing
you did when you got here, <i>James,</i>

402
00:31:04,981 --> 00:31:06,698
was to gather everyone in a circle

403
00:31:06,814 --> 00:31:08,953
and tell them about the man
you shot in cold blood

404
00:31:08,954 --> 00:31:10,613
the night before you got on the plane.

405
00:31:12,444 --> 00:31:14,649
So why don't we just skip the part

406
00:31:14,966 --> 00:31:16,889
where you two pretend to be righteous?

407
00:31:18,822 --> 00:31:21,349
I'm taking that medication
back to Claire,

408
00:31:22,066 --> 00:31:23,539
and you're gonna let me,

409
00:31:24,530 --> 00:31:25,963
because if she doesn't get it,

410
00:31:26,156 --> 00:31:27,410
she's gonna die.

411
00:31:29,194 --> 00:31:30,372
And the last thing

412
00:31:31,079 --> 00:31:33,186
that either of you need right now...

413
00:31:36,527 --> 00:31:38,163
is more blood on your hands.

414
00:32:54,458 --> 00:32:57,834
Goodwin! Ethan,
there may actually be survivors,

415
00:32:58,024 --> 00:33:00,435
and you're one of 'em...
a passenger. You're in shock.

416
00:33:00,599 --> 00:33:02,773
Listen. Learn. Don't get involved.

417
00:33:02,927 --> 00:33:04,432
I want lists in three days.

418
00:33:14,740 --> 00:33:16,633
So I guess I'm out of the book club.

419
00:33:28,289 --> 00:33:29,770
I was looking for you this morning.

420
00:33:31,853 --> 00:33:34,113
- You and I need to talk.
- Now?

421
00:33:34,522 --> 00:33:36,250
We have some time. It's important.

422
00:33:39,841 --> 00:33:41,147
Take a walk with me.

423
00:33:51,589 --> 00:33:52,959
Mikhail, we're here.

424
00:33:55,324 --> 00:33:57,648
- He never has his walkie on.
- What are we doing here?

425
00:33:57,759 --> 00:33:59,303
Something I need to show you.

426
00:34:02,354 --> 00:34:05,265
It's Ben! I'm here with Juliet!

427
00:34:05,744 --> 00:34:08,480
We're approaching the house!
Don't shoot us.

428
00:34:08,969 --> 00:34:10,454
Well, hurry up, then!

429
00:34:14,585 --> 00:34:15,800
Did you see it?

430
00:34:16,434 --> 00:34:18,341
A plane fell out of the sky, Mikhail.

431
00:34:19,073 --> 00:34:20,344
Of course we saw it.

432
00:34:21,425 --> 00:34:22,554
What do you have so far?

433
00:34:22,784 --> 00:34:24,410
Oceanic flight 815...

434
00:34:24,647 --> 00:34:27,051
left Sydney, Australia,
headed for Los Angeles,

435
00:34:27,332 --> 00:34:30,072
324 people on board,
including the flight crew.

436
00:34:30,187 --> 00:34:32,462
I want detailed files
on every single passenger.

437
00:34:32,659 --> 00:34:33,855
Already working on it.

438
00:34:34,438 --> 00:34:36,790
Can we uplink to Richard
in Acadia park, please?

439
00:34:42,001 --> 00:34:43,731
Yesterday you called me a liar.

440
00:34:45,738 --> 00:34:46,997
I was hurt by that.

441
00:34:50,881 --> 00:34:52,413
Hello, Richard. Can you hear me?

442
00:34:57,329 --> 00:34:58,544
Notice today's date.

443
00:34:58,718 --> 00:35:00,551
This is live. Okay, Richard.

444
00:35:14,150 --> 00:35:15,327
Oh, my God.

445
00:35:21,966 --> 00:35:23,336
Oh, my God.

446
00:35:24,721 --> 00:35:26,901
A little over two years ago,
to everyone's surprise,

447
00:35:27,801 --> 00:35:29,836
Rachel's cancer
went into complete remission.

448
00:35:33,271 --> 00:35:35,888
Shortly after,
she gave birth to a healthy baby boy.

449
00:35:37,014 --> 00:35:38,538
His name is <i>Julian.</i>

450
00:35:47,924 --> 00:35:49,207
Okay, thank you, Richard.

451
00:35:49,692 --> 00:35:51,679
You'll want to get back here
as soon as you can.

452
00:35:51,852 --> 00:35:53,222
We may have some new visitors.

453
00:35:54,498 --> 00:35:56,733
Oh, god! No, no!

454
00:36:03,340 --> 00:36:04,844
I'm not a liar, Juliet.

455
00:36:08,278 --> 00:36:10,478
- I wanna go home.
- That's not our agreement.

456
00:36:10,516 --> 00:36:12,565
You need to stay here
until your work is finished.

457
00:36:12,566 --> 00:36:15,951
It's impossible.
The mothers keep dying.

458
00:36:16,057 --> 00:36:17,562
Then we'll find more mothers.

459
00:36:19,305 --> 00:36:20,510
Who knows?

460
00:36:20,816 --> 00:36:22,722
Maybe there's even one on that plane.

461
00:36:37,940 --> 00:36:39,356
Wait. What are you doing?

462
00:36:40,772 --> 00:36:43,145
She's not touching her.
She's the one who did this to her.

463
00:36:43,184 --> 00:36:44,818
- She can help her.
- Says who? <i>her?</i>

464
00:36:44,874 --> 00:36:46,861
- How can you even trust her?
- I do trust her.

465
00:36:49,611 --> 00:36:50,867
Do you trust <i>me?</i>

466
00:36:52,552 --> 00:36:53,851
Do you trust me?

467
00:36:59,046 --> 00:37:00,881
Just give us a couple minutes here,
okay?

468
00:37:05,238 --> 00:37:06,747
How long before this takes effect?

469
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:08,707
We should see results in a few hours.

470
00:37:14,676 --> 00:37:16,948
If this doesn't work,
if something happens to her...

471
00:37:19,786 --> 00:37:21,715
I'm not gonna be able
to protect you anymore.

472
00:37:23,284 --> 00:37:24,615
You'll be on your own.

473
00:37:27,735 --> 00:37:29,433
I'm already on my own, Jack.

474
00:38:04,036 --> 00:38:05,226
What happened?

475
00:38:27,866 --> 00:38:31,050
I've got a tarp, couple of blankets,

476
00:38:31,499 --> 00:38:32,727
airline pillows.

477
00:38:35,824 --> 00:38:36,998
It's not much,
but...

478
00:38:37,832 --> 00:38:39,279
it'll get you started.

479
00:38:42,288 --> 00:38:43,604
Claire's awake.

480
00:38:47,343 --> 00:38:50,079
There's a lean-to
that we've been using for shade,

481
00:38:50,843 --> 00:38:54,509
and everyone says that it'd be all right
if you set up camp there for now.

482
00:38:55,780 --> 00:38:56,937
Thank you.

483
00:38:58,084 --> 00:38:59,324
They're good people,

484
00:39:00,050 --> 00:39:02,432
and they're willing to give you
the benefit of the doubt.

485
00:39:04,302 --> 00:39:06,636
But eventually they're gonna need
some answers.

486
00:39:09,620 --> 00:39:10,897
Why don't you?

487
00:39:14,091 --> 00:39:15,711
You keep talking about <i>them.</i>

488
00:39:17,251 --> 00:39:19,873
why don't I ever have
to explain myself to <i>you?</i>

489
00:39:24,179 --> 00:39:25,422
You were there.

490
00:39:27,393 --> 00:39:30,151
You were standing right next to me
when that submarine exploded...

491
00:39:32,021 --> 00:39:34,066
And in that moment,
I saw it in your eyes.

492
00:39:36,842 --> 00:39:39,743
You wanna get off this island
more than anything else in the world.

493
00:39:44,309 --> 00:39:45,794
That makes you one of us.

494
00:40:10,649 --> 00:40:11,884
<i>Let's go over it again.</i>

495
00:40:12,018 --> 00:40:14,236
- I know what to do.
- Let's go over it again,

496
00:40:14,333 --> 00:40:15,763
just to be sure.

497
00:40:16,964 --> 00:40:19,047
I drag Austen out into the jungle,

498
00:40:19,144 --> 00:40:20,899
handcuff myself to her,

499
00:40:21,912 --> 00:40:24,271
then tell her I was gassed
just like she was.

500
00:40:24,368 --> 00:40:26,046
And if she catches you in the lie?

501
00:40:26,162 --> 00:40:27,374
I'll admit to it,

502
00:40:27,606 --> 00:40:29,963
tell her it was the only way
to earn her trust.

503
00:40:32,771 --> 00:40:34,392
Good. What then?

504
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:37,849
They'll take me back to the beach.

505
00:40:45,243 --> 00:40:46,996
<i>I know you want me to go there,</i>

506
00:40:47,983 --> 00:40:49,996
<i>but after everything we've done to them,</i>

507
00:40:50,818 --> 00:40:52,381
<i>it's going to be a problem.</i>

508
00:40:57,792 --> 00:40:59,362
We've activated the implant in Claire.

509
00:40:59,436 --> 00:41:02,098
She should be symptomatic
within the next 48 hours.

510
00:41:02,753 --> 00:41:04,386
By the time you get to that camp,

511
00:41:05,181 --> 00:41:07,361
you'll have a nice big crisis to solve.

512
00:41:10,008 --> 00:41:11,301
<i>I'll need supplies.</i>

513
00:41:11,455 --> 00:41:12,883
<i>Pryce is already on his way.</i>

514
00:41:13,572 --> 00:41:15,734
<i>He'll hide the case
at Ethan's old drop point.</i>

515
00:41:17,422 --> 00:41:19,277
<i>Tell Jack that you can save her.</i>

516
00:41:21,349 --> 00:41:22,608
<i>He trusts you.</i>

517
00:41:31,551 --> 00:41:32,875
Are you all right?

518
00:41:38,099 --> 00:41:39,408
I'm fine.

519
00:41:51,750 --> 00:41:53,158
See you in a week.
