<i>Previously on</i> Lost...

2
00:00:01,363 --> 00:00:02,347
We think you're special.

3
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:04,987
We want you to lead a team
of highly trained people.

4
00:00:05,128 --> 00:00:06,115
How was the interview?

5
00:00:06,154 --> 00:00:08,400
Why I'd want to go
all the way to Portland

6
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:10,400
for research that doesn't even work?

7
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:13,000
Because it does work.
I'm pregnant.

8
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:16,681
My whole life, all I've ever
wanted was to have a baby.

9
00:00:16,739 --> 00:00:18,109
and now because of you, I can.

10
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:20,051
I know that you don't care,

11
00:00:20,128 --> 00:00:23,157
but the people I spent the last
three years of my life with...

12
00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:24,700
they just left me.

13
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,005
You okay?

14
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:28,700
- She is not coming with us.
- Yes, she is.

15
00:00:29,151 --> 00:00:31,000
- Why?
- They left her behind, too.

16
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,300
It's getting late.

17
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:10,800
This is a good place to make camp.

18
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:20,300
- I'll get some firewood.
- I'll go with you.

19
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:47,200
Do you wanna talk about it?

20
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,100
Talk about what?

21
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:54,500
About the week
you spent over there with them.

22
00:01:57,233 --> 00:01:58,300
Well, after you left,

23
00:01:58,700 --> 00:01:59,852
I'd...

24
00:02:01,035 --> 00:02:03,171
I'd made a deal with them...
If I took care of Ben,

25
00:02:03,308 --> 00:02:04,755
that they'd let me off the island.

26
00:02:04,793 --> 00:02:06,700
I don't know.
I just kept my head down,

27
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,100
did what I was supposed to,

28
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,800
and I didn't ask any questions.

29
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:14,900
And that's it?

30
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,200
That's it.

31
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:40,192
Okay. Let's have it.

32
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,800
I want to know what you people
are doing on this island,

33
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:47,900
why you're terrorizing us,

34
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:51,300
making lists, kidnapping children.

35
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,800
I want to know everything.

36
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,300
But the first thing
I'd like to know is...

37
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:01,000
Who are you?

38
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:19,483
Hi. I'm Juliet Burke.
'm with Mittelos Bioscience.

39
00:03:19,541 --> 00:03:21,991
- I'll let Mr. Alpert know you're here.
- Thank you.

40
00:03:26,735 --> 00:03:29,101
I think they're taking this whole
"corporate secrecy" thing

41
00:03:29,159 --> 00:03:30,400
a little too seriously.

42
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:32,587
I'm never gonna fit in
with these people.

43
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:37,000
Hey there, Dr. Burke.

44
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,908
If you pop the trunk,
I'll get your bags.

45
00:03:38,909 --> 00:03:39,971
Thank you.

46
00:03:46,179 --> 00:03:47,500
You managed to find us.

47
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:49,509
I didn't even know
they had an airport out here.

48
00:03:49,547 --> 00:03:50,800
I know. It surprises everyone.

49
00:03:50,851 --> 00:03:52,279
Hi. You must be Rachel.

50
00:03:52,781 --> 00:03:54,700
- Richard Alpert.
- Nice to meet you.

51
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:57,531
Thank you for letting us
borrow your sister for a few months.

52
00:03:57,589 --> 00:03:59,711
Just promise me
you'll bring her back in one piece.

53
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:01,100
Well, we'll do our best.

54
00:04:02,147 --> 00:04:04,800
So listen, it's a...
A security thing, you know?

55
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:07,658
We have to take you in
the rest of the way, so...

56
00:04:07,709 --> 00:04:08,763
Whenever you're ready,

57
00:04:08,801 --> 00:04:11,357
we'll be waiting right over here,
but please take your time.

58
00:04:11,613 --> 00:04:12,635
Pleasure to meet you.

59
00:04:12,729 --> 00:04:13,790
Thanks. Thank you.

60
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:22,500
It's better this way.

61
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,100
Is this a mistake?

62
00:04:24,542 --> 00:04:26,432
I shouldn't go.
What if you get sick again?

63
00:04:26,433 --> 00:04:27,800
I won't. The cancer's gone,

64
00:04:28,842 --> 00:04:31,900
and I'm 100% preggers, thanks to you.

65
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:34,700
- I'll be back... - Yes, I know.

66
00:04:34,759 --> 00:04:36,225
Before you give birth. I promise.

67
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,532
I know. Don't worry about us, okay?

68
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,411
You spent your whole life
working to get here, so...

69
00:04:44,432 --> 00:04:45,436
don't blow it.

70
00:04:49,285 --> 00:04:50,867
- I love you. - I love you.

71
00:05:00,395 --> 00:05:01,687
Go make us proud.

72
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,100
Who are you?

73
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,456
If I told you who I was,

74
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,700
if I told you everything that I know,

75
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,600
you'd kill me.

76
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:35,600
What do you think I'll do if you don't?

77
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:38,900
Leave her alone.

78
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,700
Sooner or later,
she'll answer my questions.

79
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:48,867
She'll answer your questions
when she's ready,

80
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,500
and you'll wait until she is.

81
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,900
She's under my protection.

Transcript: FRM - Presync: kevinvan
Resynchro: Sixe

83
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:50,210
What is it?

84
00:06:50,789 --> 00:06:53,393
It's okay. Shush. I know.

85
00:06:59,664 --> 00:07:00,668
You okay?

86
00:07:04,129 --> 00:07:05,350
What's going on?

87
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:07,950
- Didn't you hear Aaron? - Is he okay?

88
00:07:07,989 --> 00:07:09,690
No, he's okay, he's okay.

89
00:07:10,269 --> 00:07:11,291
Are you all right?

90
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:12,577
Yeah, I just...

91
00:07:13,173 --> 00:07:14,432
feel a little bit off.

92
00:07:14,902 --> 00:07:16,150
I didn't sleep well.

93
00:07:16,215 --> 00:07:18,293
I can't believe
I didn't hear him crying.

94
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:20,015
Maybe you're coming down
with something.

95
00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:22,250
But why don't you let me take Aaron,

96
00:07:22,607 --> 00:07:24,208
and you get some more rest?

97
00:07:24,922 --> 00:07:26,733
- Yeah, do you mind? - Absolutely.

98
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:30,950
I won't sleep... long.

99
00:07:43,842 --> 00:07:46,150
I guess it's no use asking them
to wait up, huh?

100
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:49,950
They'll come around.
Just give them some time.

101
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:53,804
My people kept Sayid chained
to a swing set for three days.

102
00:07:53,850 --> 00:07:55,420
Then I dragged Kate into the jungle,

103
00:07:55,450 --> 00:07:57,328
handcuffed myself to her
and lied about it.

104
00:07:58,950 --> 00:08:00,480
How much time do you think they need?

105
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:04,150
We'll be back to our beach
a couple hours.

106
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:05,768
They'll probably be over it by then.

107
00:08:09,056 --> 00:08:10,233
You nervous?

108
00:08:10,650 --> 00:08:11,650
Hell, yes.

109
00:08:15,311 --> 00:08:17,950
I know that six months sounds
like an eternity,

110
00:08:18,005 --> 00:08:20,850
but you're gonna be amazed
at how time flies once you're there.

111
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:22,817
I can't wait to find out
where "there" is.

112
00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:25,469
Dr. Burke, wanna have a seat?

113
00:08:25,650 --> 00:08:27,180
I'd like to take some of your vitals,

114
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:29,350
if that's okay with you.

115
00:08:29,593 --> 00:08:31,450
Yeah, sure.

116
00:08:34,850 --> 00:08:37,250
Everyone at the company
is really excited

117
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:38,950
about you coming down, Dr. Burke,

118
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:40,481
and I think your research

119
00:08:40,558 --> 00:08:42,750
is really gonna have
a major impact on us.

120
00:08:52,435 --> 00:08:54,673
- What is that?
- That is orange juice

121
00:08:54,770 --> 00:08:57,250
with a considerable amount
of tranquilizer mixed in.

122
00:08:58,998 --> 00:09:00,050
You want me to drink it?

123
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:02,850
Oh, yes. You're gonna want to be asleep
for the trip, Dr. Burke.

124
00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:04,650
It can be kind of intense.

125
00:09:07,938 --> 00:09:10,050
I was fine with signing
all of your paperwork,

126
00:09:10,163 --> 00:09:11,970
fine with agreeing to <I>not</I> talk

127
00:09:12,048 --> 00:09:13,650
to anyone in my life for six months,

128
00:09:13,921 --> 00:09:16,121
fine with the fact that no one
in the medical community

129
00:09:16,122 --> 00:09:17,719
has ever heard of Mittelos Bioscience...

130
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:18,904
Why were you fine?

131
00:09:20,050 --> 00:09:22,250
- What?
- Why were you fine with those things?

132
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:25,162
It seems like quite a leap
for a job opportunity,

133
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:27,830
and we're not paying you <I>that</I> much.

134
00:09:30,468 --> 00:09:33,785
I think you're fine because deep down,
a part of you knows

135
00:09:34,363 --> 00:09:36,486
that the place we're taking you to
is special.

136
00:09:38,691 --> 00:09:39,850
Special, huh?

137
00:09:40,598 --> 00:09:42,150
Let me ask you something, Juliet.

138
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,980
You took a woman... Your own sister...

139
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:50,714
whose reproductive system
was ravaged by chemotherapy,

140
00:09:50,830 --> 00:09:53,602
who is sterile,
and you made her pregnant.

141
00:09:54,050 --> 00:09:56,704
You created life
where life wasn't supposed to be.

142
00:09:58,150 --> 00:09:59,550
That's a gift, Juliet.

143
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:01,550
You have a gift.

144
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:05,650
Now don't you feel you're meant
to do something significant with it?

145
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:11,850
Where we're going, you can do just that.

146
00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:16,102
Where exactly are we going?

147
00:10:16,141 --> 00:10:17,356
I can't tell you that,

148
00:10:18,650 --> 00:10:20,180
but what I <I>can</I> tell you is that...

149
00:10:20,664 --> 00:10:22,250
you'll see things there

150
00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:23,775
that you never imagined.

151
00:10:27,881 --> 00:10:30,050
Now no one is forcing you
to do anything,

152
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:32,897
so if you change your mind,
we're happy to take you back to...

153
00:10:41,463 --> 00:10:43,950
You probably
shouldn't have drunk that so fast.

154
00:11:02,763 --> 00:11:03,950
Good morning.

155
00:11:05,950 --> 00:11:08,150
No, no, it's okay.
You'll be hoarse for a few hours,

156
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:09,850
but it gets better as the day goes on.

157
00:11:10,050 --> 00:11:11,750
Sorry I had to strap you in,

158
00:11:11,850 --> 00:11:13,950
but the last leg
is always a little bumpy.

159
00:11:14,050 --> 00:11:15,362
Watch your head.

160
00:11:16,964 --> 00:11:18,006
Give me your hand.

161
00:11:39,050 --> 00:11:40,050
We're here.

162
00:11:40,850 --> 00:11:41,950
Here where?

163
00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:46,650
Hello, Dr. Burke.

164
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:51,150
My name is Benjamin Linus.

165
00:12:55,450 --> 00:12:57,446
I'm really looking forward
to working with you.

166
00:12:58,550 --> 00:12:59,650
Watch your step here.

167
00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:12,525
Hey, that's too much water.

168
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:13,750
It's gonna be all soggy.

169
00:13:13,950 --> 00:13:15,857
It's oatmeal, dude.
It's supposed to be soggy.

170
00:13:17,101 --> 00:13:18,850
Well, if it ain't three men and a baby.

171
00:13:20,450 --> 00:13:21,650
I counted Hugo twice.

172
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:25,650
Oh, what? Come on. I used your name.

173
00:13:31,826 --> 00:13:33,650
Does anybody know
where there's any aspirin?

174
00:13:33,675 --> 00:13:34,950
Claire, you don't look so good.

175
00:13:35,050 --> 00:13:37,253
What are you doing up?
You're meant to be in bed.

176
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:39,256
Yeah, no, I know.

177
00:13:39,989 --> 00:13:41,090
My head is pounding.

178
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:43,492
I got you covered.
Two aspirin coming right up.

179
00:13:44,050 --> 00:13:45,050
Thank you.

180
00:13:56,050 --> 00:13:57,450
Son of a bitch.

181
00:14:01,850 --> 00:14:03,826
Jack! It's Jack!

182
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:13,848
Come on! Come on! It's Jack!

183
00:14:14,541 --> 00:14:15,544
It's Jack.

184
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:30,150
What the hell is she doing here?

185
00:15:57,145 --> 00:15:58,148
So...

186
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:01,659
You're, like, one of them, huh?

187
00:16:02,650 --> 00:16:03,650
I'm Juliet.

188
00:16:06,751 --> 00:16:08,350
I don't remember you from the dock...

189
00:16:10,050 --> 00:16:11,935
Where you put bags on our heads...

190
00:16:12,850 --> 00:16:14,079
After you shocked us.

191
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:18,371
I had the day off.

192
00:16:26,650 --> 00:16:27,950
So I hear you're a doctor.

193
00:16:28,950 --> 00:16:30,450
I'm really more of a researcher.

194
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:40,715
They send you over here
to keep an eye on me?

195
00:16:44,150 --> 00:16:47,150
The last one of you guys
that came over here... Ethan...

196
00:16:50,275 --> 00:16:53,883
He kidnapped Claire,
and Charlie got upset.

197
00:16:57,550 --> 00:16:58,750
We buried him over there.

198
00:17:23,504 --> 00:17:25,819
She's gone, Juliet. She's dead.

199
00:17:32,979 --> 00:17:35,044
It's okay. You tried.

200
00:17:41,877 --> 00:17:43,491
Why don't you go ahead and take off?

201
00:17:44,950 --> 00:17:46,179
I'll talk to Ben.

202
00:18:04,050 --> 00:18:06,250
It was Sabine's choice to get pregnant.

203
00:18:13,359 --> 00:18:15,250
She knew she was taking a risk.

204
00:18:16,650 --> 00:18:18,450
I think it happens at conception,

205
00:18:19,504 --> 00:18:21,937
and if that's the case,
there's nothing I can do about it,

206
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,250
- at least not here.
- I'm not sure I understand.

207
00:18:24,305 --> 00:18:25,833
The only way to see if I'm right

208
00:18:25,884 --> 00:18:28,250
is to take a woman off the island,
back to Miami.

209
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:30,550
No. You're not taking anybody
off the island.

210
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:38,850
In that case,
there's thing more I can do.

211
00:18:39,650 --> 00:18:41,850
I know you put a lot of faith in me,
Ben,

212
00:18:42,350 --> 00:18:44,350
and I'm sorry I couldn't help you.

213
00:18:46,550 --> 00:18:49,478
My sister's giving birth
in three months...

214
00:18:50,650 --> 00:18:52,750
and I haven't even been able
to call her.

215
00:18:56,150 --> 00:18:57,750
It's time for me to go home.

216
00:19:03,992 --> 00:19:06,615
Your sister won't be giving birth
in three months, Juliet.

217
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:12,150
She'll be dead before then.

218
00:19:12,936 --> 00:19:14,287
Her cancer's back.

219
00:19:38,650 --> 00:19:39,892
Where did you get this?

220
00:19:40,065 --> 00:19:42,176
Mikhail. Sorry.
I should have told you sooner.

221
00:19:42,177 --> 00:19:43,879
But I didn't see what good
it would do...

222
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:45,850
What good it would do?!
Could have gone home!

223
00:19:45,950 --> 00:19:47,259
I could have been with her!

224
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:48,264
You still can.

225
00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:52,201
You can go home, Juliet,
be with her in her final days,

226
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:55,567
or you can stay here
and help me with our problem.

227
00:19:57,550 --> 00:19:58,950
Why would I stay?

228
00:19:59,150 --> 00:20:01,338
Because if you do,
I will cure your sister's cancer.

229
00:20:03,450 --> 00:20:05,199
I'm supposed to take that on faith?

230
00:20:05,283 --> 00:20:06,599
You've been here for six months.

231
00:20:06,950 --> 00:20:08,829
You've done extensive workups
on all of us.

232
00:20:08,863 --> 00:20:11,830
- Have you seen even a trace of cancer?
- That's <i>here!</i>

233
00:20:12,013 --> 00:20:15,043
And being that you won't let me bring
my sister here, I'm gonna need more...

234
00:20:15,044 --> 00:20:16,850
Jacob said
he would take care of it himself.

235
00:20:18,521 --> 00:20:20,598
Unless, of course,
you don't have faith in <i>him.</i>

236
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:24,650
Every woman on this island needs you.

237
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:27,050
If you choose to stay,

238
00:20:27,950 --> 00:20:29,150
I promise you,

239
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:31,250
we will save Rachel's life.

240
00:20:38,713 --> 00:20:40,855
Trust her? She's one of them.

241
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:42,550
Not anymore. They left her behind.

242
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:45,101
- Oh, yeah? Where'd they go?
- I told you. I don't know.

243
00:20:45,102 --> 00:20:47,650
- Maybe we better ask her.
- She doesn't know either.

244
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:50,705
Here's a wacky idea.
Let's sic our resident Iraqi on her,

245
00:20:50,790 --> 00:20:52,864
let him do what he does,
then see what she says.

246
00:20:52,881 --> 00:20:54,150
I don't do that anymore.

247
00:20:54,350 --> 00:20:55,750
Well, ain't that convenient?

248
00:20:56,550 --> 00:20:59,281
But I don't trust her, Jack.
If she's so innocent...

249
00:20:59,450 --> 00:21:01,049
why won't she answer our questions?

250
00:21:01,050 --> 00:21:02,709
Just give her some time. She's afraid.

251
00:21:02,776 --> 00:21:03,895
How much time?

252
00:21:03,950 --> 00:21:06,309
Look, the fact that I trust her
should be enough.

253
00:21:06,657 --> 00:21:07,844
It's not.

254
00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:11,550
Where did Locke go?

255
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:14,536
He went with them,
right after he destroyed the sub...

256
00:21:14,570 --> 00:21:16,596
The sub that was gonna take <i>me</i>
off this island.

257
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:18,350
- What?
- They were gonna let you go?

258
00:21:19,496 --> 00:21:20,635
Said who?

259
00:21:22,050 --> 00:21:23,050
Ben.

260
00:21:25,369 --> 00:21:27,950
- Whose life you saved.
- Sawyer, lay off.

261
00:21:28,050 --> 00:21:29,942
Shoulda let that bug-eyed bastard die!

262
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,393
- He did it for us.
- Sounds like he did it for him.

263
00:21:33,164 --> 00:21:34,709
Is there something you wanna ask me?

264
00:21:34,748 --> 00:21:36,166
I wanna ask you why you're fighting

265
00:21:36,205 --> 00:21:38,426
every single one of us
and sticking up for one of them?

266
00:21:38,447 --> 00:21:40,184
I spent every moment over there

267
00:21:40,242 --> 00:21:41,807
trying to find a way off this island.

268
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,832
I was trying to help all of us.

269
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:45,781
I was trying to get us rescued.

270
00:21:48,434 --> 00:21:49,881
Something's wrong with Claire!

271
00:21:51,776 --> 00:21:52,933
Is she okay?

272
00:21:54,177 --> 00:21:55,914
Grab her, grab her.

273
00:21:56,350 --> 00:21:57,850
Let's get her up. Let's get her up.

274
00:22:00,143 --> 00:22:01,510
How long has she been like this?

275
00:22:01,587 --> 00:22:03,092
She started feeling bad this morning.

276
00:22:03,150 --> 00:22:05,508
Before we got back,
was she showing any symptoms at all?

277
00:22:05,546 --> 00:22:06,569
No, she was fine.

278
00:22:06,941 --> 00:22:08,550
Has she been drinking enough water?

279
00:22:08,650 --> 00:22:11,050
- I think so, yeah.
- All right, keep that head up.

280
00:22:13,875 --> 00:22:15,050
What happened to her?

281
00:22:18,450 --> 00:22:20,052
He said, "what do <i>you</i> care?"

282
00:22:28,589 --> 00:22:29,750
I need your help.

283
00:22:29,944 --> 00:22:31,350
I need you to go and get Jack.

284
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:34,650
- He's busy right now.
- Please, I have to talk to him.

285
00:22:34,950 --> 00:22:36,450
You wanna tell me why you need Jack?

286
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:40,761
Because I think I know
what's wrong with Claire.

287
00:22:42,450 --> 00:22:43,450
Why?

288
00:22:44,950 --> 00:22:46,450
Because I did it to her.

289
00:23:14,124 --> 00:23:15,900
Giving you a bad feeling
in your stomach?

290
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,400
Yeah, me, too.

291
00:23:22,517 --> 00:23:24,249
Claire's immune system
is turning on her.

292
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:25,500
She's having a latent reaction

293
00:23:25,531 --> 00:23:27,769
- to a medication in her bloodstream.
- What medication?

294
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:31,205
It was designed to keep her alive
during the late stages of her pregnancy.

295
00:23:31,321 --> 00:23:32,405
Designed by who?

296
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:35,200
By me.

297
00:23:35,319 --> 00:23:37,900
For some reason
the women here can't have babies.

298
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,700
The mother's body
turns on the pregnancy,

299
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,300
treats it as a foreign invader.

300
00:23:42,473 --> 00:23:44,537
I saw it happen over and over.

301
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:47,200
Every pregnant woman
on this island died...

302
00:23:50,999 --> 00:23:52,041
That is,

303
00:23:52,195 --> 00:23:54,100
every pregnant woman until Claire.

304
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:56,800
What did you do to her?

305
00:23:59,647 --> 00:24:01,615
One of our people infiltrated your camp

306
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,100
and began taking blood samples

307
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:06,800
right after your plane crashed.

308
00:24:12,724 --> 00:24:14,792
Even though Claire
didn't conceive on this island,

309
00:24:14,830 --> 00:24:17,971
we found that her symptoms
were consistent with previous mothers,

310
00:24:18,048 --> 00:24:20,131
- so we tried to save her life.
- By kidnapping her?

311
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:22,265
No, that wasn't supposed to happen.

312
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,707
She was our control case.

313
00:24:25,344 --> 00:24:27,307
I had developed a serum that...

314
00:24:27,693 --> 00:24:29,900
I thought would reverse
what was happening to her.

315
00:24:29,901 --> 00:24:32,190
Ethan was administering the injections.

316
00:24:33,564 --> 00:24:36,382
<i>Then you found out
that he wasn't on the plane.</i>

317
00:24:36,947 --> 00:24:38,900
The census... I interviewed everyone.

318
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,564
One of them isn't in the manifest.

319
00:24:41,298 --> 00:24:42,629
He wasn't on the plane.

320
00:24:43,107 --> 00:24:45,800
So... he improvised.

321
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:47,700
Hello there.

322
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,100
<i>He kidnapped her on his own.</i>

323
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,600
<i>That was never the plan.</i>

324
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:00,908
Look, I know how this sounds,

325
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:03,800
but without those injections,
Claire would have died.

326
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:08,040
Without the serum,
she's going into a form of withdrawal,

327
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:09,900
and if I don't treat her quickly,

328
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,300
her immune system
could shut down entirely.

329
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:15,021
Jack, I can fix this.

330
00:25:15,523 --> 00:25:17,008
I just need the serum.

331
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:20,709
Ethan kept a stash of medical supplies
near the caves where you used to live.

332
00:25:20,798 --> 00:25:22,109
If I go right now,

333
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:24,400
I can be back before it's too late.

334
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:32,800
Do it.

335
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:35,500
Get moving.

336
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:43,400
Where are you?

337
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:48,100
In bed... with you.

338
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:55,900
And where <i>were</i> you?

339
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:58,200
I was just realizing...

340
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:03,162
that tomorrow I will have been
on this island for three years.

341
00:26:09,710 --> 00:26:11,099
Then I better bake a cake.

342
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:17,600
Stay here.

343
00:26:31,348 --> 00:26:32,467
What have you got there?

344
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:36,700
Karl developed some x-rays for me.

345
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:39,600
What's wrong?

346
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:48,159
Morning, Juliet.

347
00:26:58,351 --> 00:26:59,856
- Hi.
- Can I come in?

348
00:27:00,801 --> 00:27:01,829
Of course.

349
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:05,695
I was just finishing "Carrie."

350
00:27:05,899 --> 00:27:08,751
I still don't know why you picked it,
but, boy, is it depressing.

351
00:27:08,886 --> 00:27:10,024
You have a tumor.

352
00:27:12,629 --> 00:27:13,631
What?

353
00:27:13,632 --> 00:27:16,800
When you told me about your back pain,
I said that I would take some x-rays

354
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:19,600
to see if it was a small fracture
or a herniated disc,

355
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:21,575
but that's not your problem.

356
00:27:23,276 --> 00:27:26,400
Your problem is a large tumor
surrounding your l4 vertebra.

357
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,100
You're surprised.

358
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:43,508
You've just told me that I have cancer.
Of course I'm surprised.

359
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:45,500
No, I told you that you had a tumor.

360
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:56,543
- Why are you scared?
- I'm not scared.

361
00:27:56,897 --> 00:27:58,942
Why are you scared, Ben?

362
00:27:59,162 --> 00:28:01,500
You said no one on this island
ever had cancer.

363
00:28:01,531 --> 00:28:03,425
- You told me that...
- I know what I told you.

364
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:04,768
You told me you could fix it.

365
00:28:04,826 --> 00:28:07,546
You said that you cured my sister.
You lied to me.

366
00:28:07,605 --> 00:28:08,647
No, I did not lie to you.

367
00:28:08,724 --> 00:28:10,789
If you can cure cancer,
then why do you have it?

368
00:28:14,029 --> 00:28:15,109
I don't know.

369
00:28:16,573 --> 00:28:18,872
I wanna talk to her.
I wanna talk to Rachel.

370
00:28:18,949 --> 00:28:20,735
I wanna talk to her now!

371
00:28:20,812 --> 00:28:22,361
That's not gonna happen, Juliet,

372
00:28:22,458 --> 00:28:24,310
but I can promise you
that Rachel is fine.

373
00:28:24,408 --> 00:28:26,337
- You never cured her!
- I did!

374
00:28:26,414 --> 00:28:28,189
- You're a liar!
- No, Juliet...

375
00:28:28,247 --> 00:28:30,300
- You lied to me!
- I told you the truth!

376
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:39,575
I gave you my word.

377
00:28:46,688 --> 00:28:47,865
I know.

378
00:28:54,513 --> 00:28:55,748
I wanna go home.

379
00:28:56,415 --> 00:28:58,518
I wanna go home, Ben. Please.

380
00:28:59,907 --> 00:29:02,377
Can't you please just let me go home?

381
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,229
No.

382
00:29:43,921 --> 00:29:45,200
Step away from the case!

383
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:49,400
- Listen to me, Sayid...
- Step back.

384
00:29:52,505 --> 00:29:55,033
It's full of medical supplies.
They're for Claire.

385
00:29:55,303 --> 00:29:56,388
Jack knows all about it.

386
00:29:56,427 --> 00:29:58,096
Jack ain't here right now, is he?

387
00:30:03,490 --> 00:30:04,860
I'm telling you the truth.

388
00:30:04,982 --> 00:30:07,364
You said earlier if you told me
everything you knew,

389
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:09,255
I'd kill you.

390
00:30:11,420 --> 00:30:13,697
I'm going to test
the validity of that statement.

391
00:30:13,774 --> 00:30:14,941
He means, "talk."

392
00:30:15,432 --> 00:30:16,827
We don't have time for this.

393
00:30:16,923 --> 00:30:18,255
We cleared our schedules.

394
00:30:19,088 --> 00:30:20,623
We got all the time in the world.

395
00:30:27,430 --> 00:30:28,774
You know, it's interesting...

396
00:30:29,596 --> 00:30:32,244
that you two are now
the camp's moral police.

397
00:30:35,058 --> 00:30:37,064
I'm curious, Sayid.

398
00:30:38,751 --> 00:30:41,371
How long was it before
you told everyone on that beach

399
00:30:41,410 --> 00:30:44,171
exactly how many people
you've tortured in your life?

400
00:30:46,328 --> 00:30:47,889
Do they know about Basra?

401
00:30:51,539 --> 00:30:55,268
And I'm sure the first thing
you did when you got here, <i>James,</i>

402
00:30:55,731 --> 00:30:57,448
was to gather everyone in a circle

403
00:30:57,564 --> 00:30:59,703
and tell them about the man
you shot in cold blood

404
00:30:59,704 --> 00:31:01,363
the night before you got on the plane.

405
00:31:03,194 --> 00:31:05,399
So why don't we just skip the part

406
00:31:05,716 --> 00:31:07,639
where you two pretend to be righteous?

407
00:31:09,572 --> 00:31:12,099
I'm taking that medication
back to Claire,

408
00:31:12,816 --> 00:31:14,289
and you're gonna let me,

409
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:16,713
because if she doesn't get it,

410
00:31:16,906 --> 00:31:18,160
she's gonna die.

411
00:31:19,244 --> 00:31:20,422
And the last thing

412
00:31:21,129 --> 00:31:23,236
that either of you need right now...

413
00:31:26,577 --> 00:31:28,213
is more blood on your hands.

414
00:32:44,508 --> 00:32:47,884
Goodwin! Ethan,
there may actually be survivors,

415
00:32:48,074 --> 00:32:50,485
and you're one of 'em...
a passenger. You're in shock.

416
00:32:50,649 --> 00:32:52,823
Listen. Learn. Don't get involved.

417
00:32:52,977 --> 00:32:54,482
I want lists in three days.

418
00:33:04,790 --> 00:33:06,683
So I guess I'm out of the book club.

419
00:33:18,339 --> 00:33:19,820
I was looking for you this morning.

420
00:33:21,903 --> 00:33:24,163
- You and I need to talk.
- Now?

421
00:33:24,572 --> 00:33:26,300
We have some time. It's important.

422
00:33:29,891 --> 00:33:31,197
Take a walk with me.

423
00:33:41,639 --> 00:33:43,009
Mikhail, we're here.

424
00:33:45,374 --> 00:33:47,698
- He never has his walkie on.
- What are we doing here?

425
00:33:47,809 --> 00:33:49,353
Something I need to show you.

426
00:33:52,404 --> 00:33:55,315
It's Ben! I'm here with Juliet!

427
00:33:55,794 --> 00:33:58,530
We're approaching the house!
Don't shoot us.

428
00:33:59,019 --> 00:34:00,504
Well, hurry up, then!

429
00:34:04,635 --> 00:34:05,850
Did you see it?

430
00:34:06,484 --> 00:34:08,391
A plane fell out of the sky, Mikhail.

431
00:34:09,123 --> 00:34:10,394
Of course we saw it.

432
00:34:11,475 --> 00:34:12,604
What do you have so far?

433
00:34:12,834 --> 00:34:14,460
Oceanic flight 815...

434
00:34:14,697 --> 00:34:17,101
left Sydney, Australia,
headed for Los Angeles,

435
00:34:17,382 --> 00:34:20,122
324 people on board,
including the flight crew.

436
00:34:20,237 --> 00:34:22,512
I want detailed files
on every single passenger.

437
00:34:22,709 --> 00:34:23,905
Already working on it.

438
00:34:24,488 --> 00:34:26,840
Can we uplink to Richard
in Acadia park, please?

439
00:34:32,051 --> 00:34:33,781
Yesterday you called me a liar.

440
00:34:35,788 --> 00:34:37,047
I was hurt by that.

441
00:34:40,931 --> 00:34:42,463
Hello, Richard. Can you hear me?

442
00:34:47,379 --> 00:34:48,594
Notice today's date.

443
00:34:48,768 --> 00:34:50,601
This is live. Okay, Richard.

444
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:05,377
Oh, my God.

445
00:35:12,016 --> 00:35:13,386
Oh, my God.

446
00:35:14,771 --> 00:35:16,951
A little over two years ago,
to everyone's surprise,

447
00:35:17,851 --> 00:35:19,886
Rachel's cancer
went into complete remission.

448
00:35:23,321 --> 00:35:25,938
Shortly after,
she gave birth to a healthy baby boy.

449
00:35:27,064 --> 00:35:28,588
His name is <i>Julian.</i>

450
00:35:37,974 --> 00:35:39,257
Okay, thank you, Richard.

451
00:35:39,742 --> 00:35:41,729
You'll want to get back here
as soon as you can.

452
00:35:41,902 --> 00:35:43,272
We may have some new visitors.

453
00:35:44,548 --> 00:35:46,783
Oh, god! No, no!

454
00:35:53,390 --> 00:35:54,894
I'm not a liar, Juliet.

455
00:35:58,328 --> 00:36:00,528
- I wanna go home.
- That's not our agreement.

456
00:36:00,566 --> 00:36:02,615
You need to stay here
until your work is finished.

457
00:36:02,616 --> 00:36:06,001
It's impossible.
The mothers keep dying.

458
00:36:06,107 --> 00:36:07,612
Then we'll find more mothers.

459
00:36:09,355 --> 00:36:10,560
Who knows?

460
00:36:10,866 --> 00:36:12,772
Maybe there's even one on that plane.

461
00:36:27,990 --> 00:36:29,406
Wait. What are you doing?

462
00:36:30,822 --> 00:36:33,195
She's not touching her.
She's the one who did this to her.

463
00:36:33,234 --> 00:36:34,868
- She can help her.
- Says who? <i>her?</i>

464
00:36:34,924 --> 00:36:36,911
- How can you even trust her?
- I do trust her.

465
00:36:39,661 --> 00:36:40,917
Do you trust <i>me?</i>

466
00:36:42,602 --> 00:36:43,901
Do you trust me?

467
00:36:49,096 --> 00:36:50,931
Just give us a couple minutes here,
okay?

468
00:36:55,288 --> 00:36:56,797
How long before this takes effect?

469
00:36:56,890 --> 00:36:58,757
We should see results in a few hours.

470
00:37:04,726 --> 00:37:06,998
If this doesn't work,
if something happens to her...

471
00:37:09,836 --> 00:37:11,765
I'm not gonna be able
to protect you anymore.

472
00:37:13,334 --> 00:37:14,665
You'll be on your own.

473
00:37:17,785 --> 00:37:19,483
I'm already on my own, Jack.

474
00:37:52,636 --> 00:37:53,826
What happened?

475
00:38:16,466 --> 00:38:19,650
I've got a tarp, couple of blankets,

476
00:38:20,099 --> 00:38:21,327
airline pillows.

477
00:38:24,424 --> 00:38:25,598
It's not much,
but...

478
00:38:26,432 --> 00:38:27,879
it'll get you started.

479
00:38:30,888 --> 00:38:32,204
Claire's awake.

480
00:38:35,943 --> 00:38:38,679
There's a lean-to
that we've been using for shade,

481
00:38:39,443 --> 00:38:43,109
and everyone says that it'd be all right
if you set up camp there for now.

482
00:38:44,380 --> 00:38:45,537
Thank you.

483
00:38:46,684 --> 00:38:47,924
They're good people,

484
00:38:48,650 --> 00:38:51,032
and they're willing to give you
the benefit of the doubt.

485
00:38:52,902 --> 00:38:55,236
But eventually they're gonna need
some answers.

486
00:38:58,220 --> 00:38:59,497
Why don't you?

487
00:39:02,691 --> 00:39:04,311
You keep talking about <i>them.</i>

488
00:39:05,851 --> 00:39:08,473
why don't I ever have
to explain myself to <i>you?</i>

489
00:39:12,779 --> 00:39:14,022
You were there.

490
00:39:15,993 --> 00:39:18,751
You were standing right next to me
when that submarine exploded...

491
00:39:20,621 --> 00:39:22,666
And in that moment,
I saw it in your eyes.

492
00:39:25,442 --> 00:39:28,343
You wanna get off this island
more than anything else in the world.

493
00:39:32,909 --> 00:39:34,394
That makes you one of us.

494
00:39:59,249 --> 00:40:00,484
<i>Let's go over it again.</i>

495
00:40:00,618 --> 00:40:02,836
- I know what to do.
- Let's go over it again,

496
00:40:02,933 --> 00:40:04,363
just to be sure.

497
00:40:05,564 --> 00:40:07,647
I drag Austen out into the jungle,

498
00:40:07,744 --> 00:40:09,499
handcuff myself to her,

499
00:40:10,512 --> 00:40:12,871
then tell her I was gassed
just like she was.

500
00:40:12,968 --> 00:40:14,646
And if she catches you in the lie?

501
00:40:14,762 --> 00:40:15,974
I'll admit to it,

502
00:40:16,206 --> 00:40:18,563
tell her it was the only way
to earn her trust.

503
00:40:21,371 --> 00:40:22,992
Good. What then?

504
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:26,449
They'll take me back to the beach.

505
00:40:33,843 --> 00:40:35,596
<i>I know you want me to go there,</i>

506
00:40:36,583 --> 00:40:38,596
<i>but after everything we've done to them,</i>

507
00:40:39,418 --> 00:40:40,981
<i>it's going to be a problem.</i>

508
00:40:46,392 --> 00:40:47,962
We've activated the implant in Claire.

509
00:40:48,036 --> 00:40:50,698
She should be symptomatic
within the next 48 hours.

510
00:40:51,353 --> 00:40:52,986
By the time you get to that camp,

511
00:40:53,781 --> 00:40:55,961
you'll have a nice big crisis to solve.

512
00:40:58,608 --> 00:40:59,901
<i>I'll need supplies.</i>

513
00:41:00,055 --> 00:41:01,483
<i>Pryce is already on his way.</i>

514
00:41:02,172 --> 00:41:04,334
<i>He'll hide the case
at Ethan's old drop point.</i>

515
00:41:06,022 --> 00:41:07,877
<i>Tell Jack that you can save her.</i>

516
00:41:09,949 --> 00:41:11,208
<i>He trusts you.</i>

517
00:41:20,151 --> 00:41:21,475
Are you all right?

518
00:41:26,699 --> 00:41:28,008
I'm fine.

519
00:41:40,350 --> 00:41:41,758
See you in a week.
