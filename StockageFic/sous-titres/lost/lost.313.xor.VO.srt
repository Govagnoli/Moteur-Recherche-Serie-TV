00:00:00,705 --> 00:00:02,078
<i>Previously on</i> Lost...

2
00:00:02,137 --> 00:00:04,626
I was in a wheelchair,
paralyzed for four years.

3
00:00:04,697 --> 00:00:06,329
This island, it changed me.

4
00:00:06,376 --> 00:00:07,479
It made me whole.

5
00:00:07,573 --> 00:00:09,663
I'm so thankful for you, John.

6
00:00:09,992 --> 00:00:11,577
You stole my kidney.

7
00:00:11,712 --> 00:00:13,872
You needed a father
and I needed a kidney,

8
00:00:14,076 --> 00:00:15,464
and that's what happened.

9
00:00:15,726 --> 00:00:16,726
Get over it.

10
00:00:16,777 --> 00:00:18,234
I don't care what Jack said.

11
00:00:18,303 --> 00:00:20,747
They've got him, and we have
to get him back. I owe him that.

12
00:00:20,771 --> 00:00:22,121
How did you get onto this island?

13
00:00:22,133 --> 00:00:23,741
They brought me on the submarine.

14
00:00:23,742 --> 00:00:26,919
So your people-- they can just come
and go whenever they want?

15
00:00:27,044 --> 00:00:29,697
You never know
when a little c4 might come in handy.

16
00:00:40,944 --> 00:00:41,966
Name?

17
00:00:42,807 --> 00:00:43,807
John Locke.

18
00:00:45,035 --> 00:00:46,403
Marital status, Mr. Locke?

19
00:00:47,744 --> 00:00:48,777
Single.

20
00:00:49,316 --> 00:00:50,326
Girlfriend?

21
00:00:54,673 --> 00:00:56,006
Are your parents living?

22
00:00:57,478 --> 00:01:00,703
I was raised in foster care.
I never really knew my parents.

23
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:05,761
Have you ever considered
seeking out your biological parents?

24
00:01:08,782 --> 00:01:10,263
I don't see how that's relevant.

25
00:01:10,318 --> 00:01:12,603
It's relevant, Mr. Locke,
because if the government's

26
00:01:12,650 --> 00:01:15,066
gonna continue paying
your disability insurance,

27
00:01:15,288 --> 00:01:18,160
I have to figure out whether or not
your condition has improved.

28
00:01:20,229 --> 00:01:23,217
So... How's your appetite?

29
00:01:25,283 --> 00:01:26,316
Fine.

30
00:01:27,957 --> 00:01:30,810
I see you stopped submitting
your therapy bills for reimbursement.

31
00:01:31,147 --> 00:01:32,702
It's 'cause I stopped going.

32
00:01:34,248 --> 00:01:35,248
Waste of time.

33
00:01:41,058 --> 00:01:43,502
It's just a temporary suspension,
Mr. Locke.

34
00:01:43,562 --> 00:01:46,506
As soon as you resume your sessions,
you can reapply.

35
00:01:46,852 --> 00:01:48,608
You think I'm temporarily disabled?

36
00:01:48,714 --> 00:01:50,547
Depression can be temporary, yes.

37
00:01:51,174 --> 00:01:54,423
And since you see fit to stop going
to therapy, I guess you're all better.

38
00:01:59,121 --> 00:02:00,198
Guess I am.

39
00:02:03,603 --> 00:02:04,624
Next!

40
00:02:15,789 --> 00:02:16,975
Over here!

41
00:02:23,955 --> 00:02:24,955
What is he doing?

42
00:02:29,259 --> 00:02:30,259
Good hands!

43
00:02:37,947 --> 00:02:38,992
Nice.

44
00:02:41,128 --> 00:02:43,570
She's the one who helped
me and Sawyer escape.

45
00:02:44,618 --> 00:02:45,686
What's up?

46
00:02:45,754 --> 00:02:47,093
I think it's gonna be a while...

47
00:02:56,307 --> 00:02:57,334
Hey, what?

48
00:03:01,631 --> 00:03:02,968
John, Rousseau's gone.

49
00:03:46,966 --> 00:03:49,743
This is gonna be more complicated
than we thought.

50
00:03:53,017 --> 00:04:06,510
Subtitles: swsub.com

51
00:04:08,684 --> 00:04:11,455
So you saying, we simply start
shooting people and hope for the best?

52
00:04:11,479 --> 00:04:13,696
We came here to rescue Jack,
and we're gonna do it.

53
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,620
But obviously
the circumstances have changed.

54
00:04:15,621 --> 00:04:17,729
- He may not want to be rescued.
- That is not him.

55
00:04:17,752 --> 00:04:18,785
That's not Jack.

56
00:04:19,122 --> 00:04:22,272
They must have done someûthing to him.
When they captured us, they drugged us.

57
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:25,423
- He didn't appear to be drugged.
- They kidnapped him, held him prisoner.

58
00:04:25,424 --> 00:04:27,159
- He wouldn't just forget that.
- I agree,

59
00:04:27,182 --> 00:04:29,544
but until we know why,
we're putting our lives at risk.

60
00:04:29,556 --> 00:04:30,685
I'm not leaving him, Sayid.

61
00:04:30,686 --> 00:04:32,591
- We may not have a choice.
- It's Jack.

62
00:04:35,138 --> 00:04:37,794
The first time I saw him,
he was risking his life

63
00:04:37,888 --> 00:04:40,280
pulling people out
of burning airplane wreckage.

64
00:04:41,098 --> 00:04:43,966
If he's shaking hands with the others,
I'm sure he has a good reason.

65
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:47,409
We just have to go down there
and find out what it is.

66
00:04:51,462 --> 00:04:52,573
What do you suggest?

67
00:04:52,669 --> 00:04:55,414
We wait till it's dark.
We approach Jack when he's alone...

68
00:04:57,775 --> 00:04:59,620
And if he wants out, we get him out.

69
00:05:01,929 --> 00:05:03,182
<i>Here's what we know, Crystal.</i>

70
00:05:03,183 --> 00:05:07,349
<i>The bolivian coal deposits
were stolen last night around 2:00 a.m.</i>

71
00:05:07,786 --> 00:05:10,410
<i>Oh, that means the cobra...
he's back.</i>

72
00:05:13,436 --> 00:05:14,716
<i>Has he been shot?</i>

73
00:05:14,952 --> 00:05:15,952
<i>I can't find him!</i>

74
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,804
<i>He's armed! I can't get up!</i>

75
00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:25,602
Hello. John Locke?

76
00:05:26,652 --> 00:05:27,957
I'm sorry. No solicitors.

77
00:05:29,152 --> 00:05:31,735
- I have a sign.
- I'm not trying to sell you...

78
00:05:32,771 --> 00:05:34,571
Listen, my name's Peter Talbot.

79
00:05:34,879 --> 00:05:36,832
I just need
a couple minutes to talk to you.

80
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:37,933
Talk about what?

81
00:05:38,228 --> 00:05:40,122
My mother, actually.

82
00:05:41,082 --> 00:05:42,702
I think she might be in some trouble.

83
00:05:42,844 --> 00:05:44,314
You got the wrong John Locke.

84
00:05:44,399 --> 00:05:46,010
How many kidneys do you have?

85
00:05:51,116 --> 00:05:52,582
She met him two months ago.

86
00:05:52,674 --> 00:05:54,896
"Love at first sight," is what she said.

87
00:05:55,128 --> 00:05:57,732
The guy was charming, sweet, funny.

88
00:05:58,784 --> 00:06:00,061
His name's Adam Seward.

89
00:06:00,433 --> 00:06:03,202
He's a retired computer entrepreneur
from Ontario.

90
00:06:06,125 --> 00:06:09,213
Anyway, Adam had something... special.

91
00:06:09,544 --> 00:06:12,268
My mom just went gaga for him
right out of the gate.

92
00:06:12,481 --> 00:06:15,585
After two months of knowing him,
she agree to marry the guy.

93
00:06:15,732 --> 00:06:17,398
And something about him...

94
00:06:18,588 --> 00:06:20,886
Something in my gut told me
that he was after something,

95
00:06:20,983 --> 00:06:22,826
so I had to check him out.

96
00:06:24,892 --> 00:06:27,496
Well, I'm not sure I know
what any of this has to do with me.

97
00:06:27,497 --> 00:06:30,160
Well, what this has to do
with you, Mr. Locke,

98
00:06:31,206 --> 00:06:34,261
is that you donated
one of your kidneys to Adam Seward,

99
00:06:34,956 --> 00:06:37,067
only his name was different back then.

100
00:06:38,238 --> 00:06:40,085
He used to be "Anthony Cooper."

101
00:06:46,372 --> 00:06:48,594
All I could find
were his medical records,

102
00:06:49,875 --> 00:06:54,346
and I saw that he was the recipient
of a kidney transplant from... You.

103
00:06:55,733 --> 00:06:56,799
So I figured, hey,

104
00:06:57,441 --> 00:06:59,699
someone gave the guy his kidney.
How bad could he be?

105
00:07:01,493 --> 00:07:02,493
Right?

106
00:07:08,846 --> 00:07:12,192
Well, it-- it was an anonymous donation.

107
00:07:12,259 --> 00:07:13,259
I never met him.

108
00:07:19,025 --> 00:07:20,025
Are you sure?

109
00:07:20,243 --> 00:07:22,126
Yeah, I'm sorry. I can't help you.

110
00:08:07,258 --> 00:08:08,796
Sayid, you guard the front.

111
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,245
I'll go around and cover the back.

112
00:08:10,377 --> 00:08:12,797
- You head in through the side door.
- I'm going in alone?

113
00:08:12,894 --> 00:08:15,290
It's better
if you're the first one he sees.

114
00:08:15,451 --> 00:08:16,461
All right.

115
00:09:40,921 --> 00:09:42,212
What are you doing here?

116
00:09:43,345 --> 00:09:44,511
I came to get you.

117
00:09:44,965 --> 00:09:45,966
Get out of here

118
00:09:46,102 --> 00:09:47,264
right now. Go.

119
00:09:48,253 --> 00:09:49,586
Kate, they're watching me!

120
00:09:50,873 --> 00:09:52,541
- Get out of here!
- I'm not leaving you.

121
00:09:52,564 --> 00:09:54,095
- Yes, you are!
- Get down!

122
00:09:54,107 --> 00:09:55,652
Don't hurt her!

123
00:09:55,699 --> 00:09:56,868
Step back, doc.

124
00:09:57,123 --> 00:09:58,257
Step back.

125
00:10:02,226 --> 00:10:03,226
Hold him still.

126
00:10:06,181 --> 00:10:07,347
Who else is with you?

127
00:10:13,785 --> 00:10:15,507
Just answer the question, Kate.

128
00:10:17,062 --> 00:10:18,358
Okay, one more time--

129
00:10:20,768 --> 00:10:22,166
who else is with you?

130
00:10:27,204 --> 00:10:28,204
Nobody.

131
00:10:29,133 --> 00:10:30,706
Nobody else. It was just us.

132
00:11:06,719 --> 00:11:07,885
Keep your voice down.

133
00:11:09,018 --> 00:11:10,018
All right.

134
00:11:12,022 --> 00:11:13,188
It's all right, John.

135
00:11:13,326 --> 00:11:15,127
You don't have to point the gun at me.

136
00:11:15,128 --> 00:11:16,739
I can tell you where Jack is.

137
00:11:17,961 --> 00:11:19,300
I'm not looking for Jack.

138
00:11:22,648 --> 00:11:24,468
I'm looking for the submarine.

139
00:11:28,076 --> 00:11:29,151
The submarine...

140
00:11:29,899 --> 00:11:30,899
where is it?

141
00:11:31,257 --> 00:11:33,007
I'm not sure what you mean, John.

142
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:34,577
What submarine?

143
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:37,344
The one you use
to travel to and from the island...

144
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:40,524
The one your man Mikhail told me about

145
00:11:41,151 --> 00:11:42,413
right before I killed him.

146
00:11:43,898 --> 00:11:45,871
Dad? Who are you talking to?

147
00:11:45,944 --> 00:11:47,260
Alex, don't come in here!

148
00:11:52,409 --> 00:11:53,445
Tell her to be quiet.

149
00:11:53,446 --> 00:11:54,557
Alex, please.

150
00:11:55,298 --> 00:11:56,409
Ben, you awake?

151
00:12:03,414 --> 00:12:04,414
I'm coming in.

152
00:12:07,071 --> 00:12:08,071
What is it?

153
00:12:08,458 --> 00:12:09,942
It's Austen and Jarrah.

154
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:12,595
They're here. Somehow they found us.

155
00:12:13,777 --> 00:12:14,869
Where are they now?

156
00:12:14,927 --> 00:12:17,476
We captured them.
We're holding 'em over at my place.

157
00:12:17,477 --> 00:12:18,668
Want me to help you get out--

158
00:12:18,715 --> 00:12:21,083
Separate them.
I want to know how they found us.

159
00:12:21,191 --> 00:12:22,987
What about Juliet and Shepard?

160
00:12:23,016 --> 00:12:25,083
- Tomorrow--
- Let me worry about that. Just go.

161
00:12:25,084 --> 00:12:26,084
Got it.

162
00:12:26,835 --> 00:12:28,112
Richard, wait a minute.

163
00:12:28,138 --> 00:12:29,138
I'll wait outside.

164
00:12:35,545 --> 00:12:37,551
I want you to bring me
the man from Tallahassee.

165
00:12:39,708 --> 00:12:42,299
- What do you need him for?
- Just do it. Now.

166
00:12:53,182 --> 00:12:55,531
"The man from Tallahassee"?
What is that...

167
00:12:55,787 --> 00:12:56,787
Some kind of code?

168
00:12:56,885 --> 00:12:59,145
No, John, unfortunately,
we don't have a code

169
00:12:59,188 --> 00:13:02,296
for "there's a man in my closet
with a gun to my daughter's head,"

170
00:13:02,541 --> 00:13:04,215
although we obviously should.

171
00:13:06,949 --> 00:13:08,499
He had a pack with him.

172
00:13:10,002 --> 00:13:11,446
I want her to retrieve it.

173
00:13:13,356 --> 00:13:14,356
Okay.

174
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:17,509
But you should know, John,
my daughter currently hates me,

175
00:13:17,610 --> 00:13:20,015
so I'm not sure holding me hostage
is your best option--

176
00:13:20,016 --> 00:13:21,016
Dad!

177
00:13:22,770 --> 00:13:23,770
I'll get your bag.

178
00:13:34,339 --> 00:13:35,713
No, nothing particular.

179
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:38,141
I'm looking for something
really stunning,

180
00:13:38,190 --> 00:13:40,794
something that would grab
everyone's attention on the table.

181
00:13:41,249 --> 00:13:42,252
Honey?

182
00:13:43,678 --> 00:13:45,180
What do you think of this one?

183
00:13:45,918 --> 00:13:47,644
Oh, it looks good. What do you think?

184
00:13:47,905 --> 00:13:50,109
I like it. Maybe just a little larger.

185
00:13:56,417 --> 00:13:57,583
Larger would be good.

186
00:13:58,864 --> 00:14:00,332
I'll go over there and take a look.

187
00:14:07,283 --> 00:14:08,283
Hello, John.

188
00:14:09,018 --> 00:14:12,389
Gonna be a big to-do or just
the two of you and a preacher?

189
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:16,069
I guess you couldn't invite me, huh?
That would make for...

190
00:14:16,851 --> 00:14:18,073
awkward introductions.

191
00:14:18,149 --> 00:14:19,391
How did you even know that I...

192
00:14:19,438 --> 00:14:23,853
I know because her son came to me
and asked why I gave you a kidney.

193
00:14:25,309 --> 00:14:27,763
He's on to you,
but he doesn't have any proof.

194
00:14:27,764 --> 00:14:30,319
So he came to me
hoping I would vouch for you.

195
00:14:31,466 --> 00:14:32,799
What did you say to him?

196
00:14:35,628 --> 00:14:37,350
You're conning her, aren't you?

197
00:14:38,731 --> 00:14:41,175
You're gonna marry her
for her money, right?

198
00:14:42,184 --> 00:14:43,693
What is it you want, John?

199
00:14:43,939 --> 00:14:45,105
I want you to end it.

200
00:14:46,342 --> 00:14:48,286
I want you to call off the wedding.

201
00:14:49,844 --> 00:14:51,121
Why are you doing this?

202
00:14:51,251 --> 00:14:53,513
Because it's not fair.

203
00:14:54,198 --> 00:14:56,863
You make people think
that you're their family,

204
00:14:57,528 --> 00:14:59,394
and then you leave their life in ruins,

205
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,859
and I'm not gonna let you do it again.

206
00:15:03,306 --> 00:15:05,806
You're gonna call off your engagement
and go,

207
00:15:06,871 --> 00:15:08,582
or I'm gonna tell her the truth.

208
00:15:11,422 --> 00:15:12,907
I want to hear you say it.

209
00:15:13,928 --> 00:15:15,428
You say you're gonna leave.

210
00:15:22,793 --> 00:15:23,793
Okay, John.

211
00:15:25,147 --> 00:15:26,147
You got it.

212
00:15:41,571 --> 00:15:43,826
Would you mind helping me
get into my chair?

213
00:15:46,524 --> 00:15:47,765
No tricks, I promise.

214
00:15:50,931 --> 00:15:52,319
I just want some dignity.

215
00:15:55,345 --> 00:15:58,934
You of all people should understand
what it means to want some dignity.

216
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:08,098
Thank you.

217
00:16:12,523 --> 00:16:13,804
So tell me, John,

218
00:16:14,450 --> 00:16:16,333
how do you expect to pilot
our submarine?

219
00:16:16,633 --> 00:16:18,943
I mean, it's a complicated
piece of machinery.

220
00:16:19,588 --> 00:16:21,184
You don't just press "submerge."

221
00:16:21,185 --> 00:16:22,851
I'll figure something out.

222
00:16:24,087 --> 00:16:26,841
For all you know,
I was a commander in the navy.

223
00:16:31,304 --> 00:16:34,020
Put your arm around my neck.
I'll lift under your knees.

224
00:16:34,153 --> 00:16:35,541
What's in the pack, John?

225
00:16:37,050 --> 00:16:38,389
If you've met Mikhail, that means

226
00:16:38,423 --> 00:16:40,339
you were in the communications
station...

227
00:16:42,365 --> 00:16:44,420
Which means you found the explosives.

228
00:16:46,749 --> 00:16:49,368
So you're not planning to pilot
the submarine anywhere, are you?

229
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:54,046
You're planning to destroy it.

230
00:16:58,145 --> 00:16:59,422
I know you, John Locke.

231
00:17:03,695 --> 00:17:05,083
You don't know me at all.

232
00:17:06,885 --> 00:17:08,846
I know you were born in California.

233
00:17:10,206 --> 00:17:12,317
I know you were raised in foster care.

234
00:17:13,216 --> 00:17:15,995
I know you wasted
a big part of your life in Tustin

235
00:17:16,167 --> 00:17:19,310
pushing papers at a company
that manufactured industrial boxes.

236
00:17:22,182 --> 00:17:23,431
I know you spent the four years

237
00:17:23,467 --> 00:17:26,414
prior to your arrival on this island
in a wheelchair.

238
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:32,331
And I know how you ended up in it.

239
00:17:39,052 --> 00:17:40,052
Tell me, John...

240
00:17:41,299 --> 00:17:42,332
Did it hurt?

241
00:17:51,224 --> 00:17:52,597
I felt my back break.

242
00:17:55,805 --> 00:17:56,850
What do you think?

243
00:18:22,862 --> 00:18:25,473
I didn't think I'd see you again
so soon, Kate.

244
00:18:29,964 --> 00:18:31,173
Be careful in here.

245
00:18:32,822 --> 00:18:33,822
Thanks.

246
00:18:53,019 --> 00:18:54,076
Did they hurt you?

247
00:18:57,795 --> 00:18:58,795
Did they hurt you?

248
00:19:07,255 --> 00:19:08,255
What is all this?

249
00:19:10,565 --> 00:19:11,898
This is where they live.

250
00:19:14,569 --> 00:19:15,957
And the people they took?

251
00:19:17,427 --> 00:19:18,427
The kids?

252
00:19:18,730 --> 00:19:19,730
They're all safe.

253
00:19:23,381 --> 00:19:24,381
"Safe"?

254
00:19:30,498 --> 00:19:31,684
So you're with them now?

255
00:19:34,975 --> 00:19:36,654
I'm not with anyone, Kate.

256
00:19:41,108 --> 00:19:42,441
What did they do to you?

257
00:19:43,659 --> 00:19:46,047
- Nothing.
- Then why are you acting like this?

258
00:19:47,167 --> 00:19:48,206
There's no way...

259
00:19:49,221 --> 00:19:50,684
You... There's no way that I could...

260
00:19:50,754 --> 00:19:51,928
I came here to help you!

261
00:19:51,929 --> 00:19:53,025
So why don't you tell me...

262
00:19:53,026 --> 00:19:55,248
I told you not to come back here for me.

263
00:19:56,727 --> 00:19:58,282
I didn't think you meant it.

264
00:20:36,388 --> 00:20:38,054
What did they do to you, Jack?

265
00:20:44,856 --> 00:20:46,189
I made a deal with them.

266
00:20:47,968 --> 00:20:49,301
They're gonna let me go.

267
00:20:53,219 --> 00:20:54,219
Where?

268
00:20:57,074 --> 00:20:58,108
Home.

269
00:21:06,490 --> 00:21:07,490
When?

270
00:21:08,292 --> 00:21:09,792
First thing in the morning.

271
00:21:13,113 --> 00:21:15,148
I can bring back help.
It's our best chance.

272
00:21:15,212 --> 00:21:16,455
You trust these people?

273
00:21:16,479 --> 00:21:18,063
They are liars. Why would you believe...

274
00:21:18,064 --> 00:21:20,508
I trust them
because you told me to, Kate...

275
00:21:22,659 --> 00:21:25,207
When you asked me
to save Sawyer's life.

276
00:21:34,847 --> 00:21:36,124
What did they tell you?

277
00:21:41,896 --> 00:21:43,904
Jack, we need to go.

278
00:21:47,370 --> 00:21:48,481
I'll be right there.

279
00:21:57,993 --> 00:22:00,753
I asked you not to come back here
for me, and I wish...

280
00:22:03,650 --> 00:22:04,927
I wish that you hadn't.

281
00:22:12,612 --> 00:22:14,343
But I will come back here for you.

282
00:22:46,942 --> 00:22:48,053
John Locke?

283
00:22:49,230 --> 00:22:50,230
Detective Mason.

284
00:22:50,682 --> 00:22:53,300
That's detective Reed. Do you mind
if we ask you a few questions?

285
00:22:53,324 --> 00:22:54,333
No, of course not.

286
00:22:54,357 --> 00:22:56,289
Do you know a man named Peter Talbot?

287
00:23:00,050 --> 00:23:01,220
No, I don't think so.

288
00:23:01,291 --> 00:23:03,416
Thin, brown hair, 20.

289
00:23:04,215 --> 00:23:06,092
If it'll be helpful,
we believe he was here

290
00:23:06,093 --> 00:23:07,587
in your apartment two days ago.

291
00:23:09,525 --> 00:23:10,881
Yeah, he was a solicitor.

292
00:23:11,017 --> 00:23:12,784
I sent him away.

293
00:23:12,865 --> 00:23:16,623
Mr. Talbot's family is worth somewhere
in the neighborhood of $200 million.

294
00:23:17,559 --> 00:23:20,553
So I'm curious. What exactly
was he selling you door-to-door?

295
00:23:20,576 --> 00:23:22,749
Well, I...
Look, I told you I don't know him.

296
00:23:22,772 --> 00:23:25,941
Then why was your name and address
on a piece of paper in his pocket?

297
00:23:28,995 --> 00:23:31,665
Why were you... would you be
looking through his pockets?

298
00:23:32,191 --> 00:23:33,753
Because Peter Talbot's dead.

299
00:23:40,557 --> 00:23:42,057
It wasn't easy, you know...

300
00:23:43,965 --> 00:23:46,307
Being in that hatch with you
all that time...

301
00:23:46,562 --> 00:23:48,950
Knowing you had no business
walking around,

302
00:23:49,461 --> 00:23:52,842
knowing I couldn't even ask you about it
without telling you who I really was.

303
00:23:53,435 --> 00:23:54,435
So ask me now...

304
00:23:57,195 --> 00:23:59,282
Now that I know who you really are.

305
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:04,900
Was it immediate?

306
00:24:05,454 --> 00:24:07,398
It started the moment you got here?

307
00:24:09,784 --> 00:24:11,733
And you were just walking,
the feeling returned

308
00:24:11,768 --> 00:24:13,212
right after the crash, that day?

309
00:24:13,261 --> 00:24:15,058
That's what "immediate" means, Ben.

310
00:24:17,924 --> 00:24:20,355
You're wondering why
it hasn't happened for you.

311
00:24:21,568 --> 00:24:23,870
You're not recovering
as fast as you like.

312
00:24:26,134 --> 00:24:28,196
How long's it been since Jack fixed you?

313
00:24:28,788 --> 00:24:29,809
A week?

314
00:24:30,739 --> 00:24:32,081
Now that I think about it,

315
00:24:32,797 --> 00:24:34,453
how did you get sick in the first place?

316
00:24:34,571 --> 00:24:36,459
Are you afraid it'll go away, John?

317
00:24:37,695 --> 00:24:39,741
Is that why you want
to destroy the submarine?

318
00:24:39,742 --> 00:24:42,806
'Cause you know if you leave the island,
you'll be back in the chair?

319
00:24:46,929 --> 00:24:48,262
You got anything to eat?

320
00:25:10,035 --> 00:25:12,864
Go on home, kid.
You know you're not supposed to be here.

321
00:25:13,332 --> 00:25:15,220
My father sent me to get his pack.

322
00:25:18,886 --> 00:25:19,886
Why?

323
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:22,600
I don't know, Ryan,
but he told me to get it.

324
00:25:23,516 --> 00:25:24,516
All right.

325
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:26,820
Here you go.

326
00:25:32,536 --> 00:25:33,869
You're Alex, aren't you?

327
00:25:35,776 --> 00:25:36,798
Hey! Can it.

328
00:25:37,345 --> 00:25:38,678
How do you know my name?

329
00:25:39,911 --> 00:25:41,689
Because you look like your mother.

330
00:25:44,825 --> 00:25:45,917
My mother is dead.

331
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:50,000
I'm sure that's what they told you.

332
00:25:52,866 --> 00:25:53,866
Get going, Alex!

333
00:26:01,967 --> 00:26:03,196
Keep your mouth shut.

334
00:26:11,846 --> 00:26:13,457
Where do you get electricity?

335
00:26:13,748 --> 00:26:16,117
We have two giant hamsters
running on a massive wheel

336
00:26:16,118 --> 00:26:18,577
- at our secret underground lair.
- Yeah, that's funny.

337
00:26:19,658 --> 00:26:22,006
There's leftovers in the refrigerator.
Help yourself.

338
00:26:33,329 --> 00:26:35,429
I ate most of the dark meat. Sorry.

339
00:26:40,483 --> 00:26:44,376
I never really appreciated chicken
until right now.

340
00:26:46,697 --> 00:26:48,791
I know you think you need
to do this, John,

341
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:50,569
but if you blow up my submarine,

342
00:26:50,747 --> 00:26:52,913
I'll have a big problem with my people.

343
00:26:53,207 --> 00:26:55,682
Is that supposed to be
an incentive not to blow it up?

344
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:00,304
I was born on this island.

345
00:27:00,963 --> 00:27:02,780
Not many of my people can say that.

346
00:27:02,914 --> 00:27:05,073
Most of them were recruited
and brought here.

347
00:27:05,074 --> 00:27:07,074
And as much as they love this place,

348
00:27:07,178 --> 00:27:09,323
as much as they would do anything
to defend it,

349
00:27:09,405 --> 00:27:11,918
they need to know they can leave
if they want to.

350
00:27:13,430 --> 00:27:15,856
The sub maintains that illusion.

351
00:27:16,634 --> 00:27:17,736
So you're lying to 'em.

352
00:27:17,737 --> 00:27:20,139
No. They're here
because they want to be here.

353
00:27:20,194 --> 00:27:23,351
Some of them are just not ready
to make a full... commitment yet.

354
00:27:24,999 --> 00:27:25,999
But you, John...

355
00:27:28,453 --> 00:27:30,453
You've already made that commitment,

356
00:27:30,603 --> 00:27:32,005
and now you have a choice.

357
00:27:32,006 --> 00:27:34,061
Because if you stop and if you think,

358
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:35,617
I can show you things...

359
00:27:36,624 --> 00:27:39,137
things I know you want
to see very badly.

360
00:27:41,612 --> 00:27:43,614
Let me put it so you'll understand.

361
00:27:47,116 --> 00:27:48,161
Picture a box.

362
00:27:49,885 --> 00:27:52,433
You know something about boxes,
don't you, John?

363
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:55,323
What if I told you
that somewhere on this island

364
00:27:55,494 --> 00:27:57,824
there's a very large box,

365
00:27:58,832 --> 00:28:01,729
and whatever you imagined,
whatever you wanted to be in it,

366
00:28:02,802 --> 00:28:06,375
when you opened at box,
there it would be.

367
00:28:09,062 --> 00:28:11,062
What would you say about that, John?

368
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:18,545
I'd say I hope that box is big enough
to imagine yourself up a new submarine.

369
00:28:22,527 --> 00:28:24,916
- Why are you so angry, John?
- Because you're cheating.

370
00:28:25,049 --> 00:28:26,115
You and your people

371
00:28:26,714 --> 00:28:29,364
communicate with the outside world
whenever you want to.

372
00:28:29,785 --> 00:28:31,393
You come and go as you please.

373
00:28:31,395 --> 00:28:34,006
You use electricity
and running water and guns.

374
00:28:34,301 --> 00:28:36,654
You're a hypocrite, a Pharisee.

375
00:28:37,107 --> 00:28:38,953
You don't deserve to be on this island.

376
00:28:39,157 --> 00:28:42,740
If you had any idea
what this place really was,

377
00:28:44,509 --> 00:28:46,950
you wouldn't be putting chicken
in your refrigerator.

378
00:28:46,986 --> 00:28:49,771
You've been here 80 days, John.
I've been here my entire life.

379
00:28:51,586 --> 00:28:55,110
So how is it that you think
you know this island better than I do?

380
00:28:55,439 --> 00:28:57,541
Because you're in the wheelchair,

381
00:28:58,896 --> 00:28:59,896
and I'm not.

382
00:29:16,728 --> 00:29:18,172
Did you have any problems?

383
00:29:24,748 --> 00:29:26,580
Okay, here's how this is gonna work...

384
00:29:26,768 --> 00:29:28,470
she's gonna take me to the sub.

385
00:29:28,605 --> 00:29:29,903
Once we're there, I let her go.

386
00:29:29,955 --> 00:29:31,783
John, she's done enough.
Let me take you.

387
00:29:32,114 --> 00:29:33,985
I don't want you to slow me down.

388
00:29:35,174 --> 00:29:37,006
Come on. Let's go.

389
00:29:37,571 --> 00:29:39,488
John, before you go, you should know...

390
00:29:40,755 --> 00:29:42,035
Jack and I made a deal.

391
00:29:43,636 --> 00:29:45,460
In less than an hour
he's leaving this island

392
00:29:45,507 --> 00:29:47,689
on that submarine,
and it's a 1-way ticket.

393
00:29:48,242 --> 00:29:50,248
The anomaly wiped out
our communications.

394
00:29:50,318 --> 00:29:52,971
We have no way of contacting
the outside world...

395
00:29:53,447 --> 00:29:55,561
Which means when that sub leaves,

396
00:29:56,701 --> 00:29:57,978
it can never come back.

397
00:29:58,905 --> 00:30:00,419
So whether you destroy the submarine

398
00:30:00,489 --> 00:30:03,006
or whether you let it go,
the end result is the same--

399
00:30:03,888 --> 00:30:05,388
no one will find this island.

400
00:30:08,594 --> 00:30:09,594
Let's go.

401
00:30:12,044 --> 00:30:13,206
Come on.

402
00:30:16,008 --> 00:30:18,014
You know he's manipulating you, right?

403
00:30:18,315 --> 00:30:19,315
How's that?

404
00:30:19,763 --> 00:30:22,337
That's what my father does.
He manipulates people.

405
00:30:22,975 --> 00:30:25,641
He makes you think it's your idea,
but it's his.

406
00:30:25,923 --> 00:30:27,645
I'll have to keep that in mind.

407
00:30:37,654 --> 00:30:39,042
Submarine's down there...

408
00:30:39,332 --> 00:30:40,695
At the end of the dock.

409
00:30:43,174 --> 00:30:45,340
I'm sorry I had to involve you in this.

410
00:31:58,951 --> 00:32:00,903
Look, I know you don't owe me anything,

411
00:32:01,230 --> 00:32:03,507
but I need to ask you
for one last favor.

412
00:32:09,792 --> 00:32:10,792
You don't knock?

413
00:32:14,751 --> 00:32:16,473
I need you to let my friends go

414
00:32:17,398 --> 00:32:18,398
after I'm gone.

415
00:32:19,609 --> 00:32:22,442
And if I said no,
would that stop you from leaving?

416
00:32:22,510 --> 00:32:23,565
Of course it would.

417
00:32:28,917 --> 00:32:31,139
Your friends
are only here to rescue you.

418
00:32:31,821 --> 00:32:34,627
But you seem to be doing
a good job of rescuing yourself, so...

419
00:32:38,430 --> 00:32:40,501
I suppose
there's no reason to keep them here.

420
00:32:41,437 --> 00:32:42,992
Do I have your word on that?

421
00:32:46,992 --> 00:32:47,992
You have my word.

422
00:32:49,612 --> 00:32:52,773
I'll let them go
just as soon as you've left the island.

423
00:33:02,267 --> 00:33:03,655
Well, I guess this is it.

424
00:33:08,899 --> 00:33:10,041
Thank you, Ben,

425
00:33:11,685 --> 00:33:13,131
for keeping your promise.

426
00:33:50,544 --> 00:33:51,805
Hold it right there!

427
00:33:52,244 --> 00:33:53,244
Get your hands up!

428
00:33:53,598 --> 00:33:55,811
Get down! I said get down!

429
00:34:07,474 --> 00:34:08,751
What are you doing here, John?

430
00:34:09,975 --> 00:34:11,165
I'm sorry, Jack.

431
00:34:14,484 --> 00:34:15,484
Sorry for what?

432
00:34:43,306 --> 00:34:44,306
What did you do?

433
00:34:45,807 --> 00:34:47,677
Tell me you didn't do it.

434
00:34:48,342 --> 00:34:51,548
- What are you talking about?
- Tell me that you didn't kill that kid!

435
00:34:51,891 --> 00:34:52,891
What?

436
00:34:52,899 --> 00:34:55,345
You think I had something to do
with Peter's death?

437
00:34:55,369 --> 00:34:57,048
I tell you to end things
with his mother,

438
00:34:57,071 --> 00:34:58,624
and the next thing you know, he's dead!

439
00:34:58,648 --> 00:35:00,107
John, now calm down, please.

440
00:35:00,226 --> 00:35:02,598
Think about what you're saying.
Why would I kill Peter?

441
00:35:02,617 --> 00:35:03,617
He was on to you!

442
00:35:03,670 --> 00:35:07,442
I've been doing this for a long time.
I'm not sweating some rich kid.

443
00:35:07,463 --> 00:35:08,673
Then why are you still here?

444
00:35:08,674 --> 00:35:10,400
- What do you mean?
- I tell you to leave.

445
00:35:10,447 --> 00:35:13,421
You tell me you're gonna leave town.
Why are you still here?

446
00:35:14,585 --> 00:35:15,837
Now listen, John,

447
00:35:16,101 --> 00:35:17,481
I'll be honest with you.

448
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:19,440
I didn't end it.

449
00:35:19,946 --> 00:35:21,446
I was looking for an angle.

450
00:35:21,696 --> 00:35:24,042
I wanted to make some money
before I skipped out.

451
00:35:24,803 --> 00:35:26,303
But then all this happened.

452
00:35:27,004 --> 00:35:29,938
Peter died, and everything
just went straight into the tank.

453
00:35:31,823 --> 00:35:32,926
She's devastated.

454
00:35:34,374 --> 00:35:35,714
She's called off the wedding.

455
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:38,186
There's no profit in it, John.

456
00:35:39,069 --> 00:35:41,067
I'm a con man, not a murder.

457
00:35:44,126 --> 00:35:45,626
She called off the wedding?

458
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:49,224
She said she couldn't deal with it.

459
00:35:50,141 --> 00:35:53,424
- She needs to be alone.
- So if I were to call her right now,

460
00:35:54,063 --> 00:35:55,624
that's what she would tell me?

461
00:35:58,469 --> 00:36:00,191
Phone's right over there, John.

462
00:36:06,847 --> 00:36:08,080
What's her numb--

463
00:36:15,879 --> 00:36:18,738
Mr. Locke, we know this isn't
what you want to hear, but...

464
00:36:19,672 --> 00:36:20,727
Your father's gone.

465
00:36:21,982 --> 00:36:24,411
We know he fled to Mexico
shortly after your...

466
00:36:24,652 --> 00:36:27,106
encounter, then he disappeared.

467
00:36:28,091 --> 00:36:31,232
I'm sorry, but he could be
anywhere in the world right now.

468
00:36:33,587 --> 00:36:34,589
All right, detectives,

469
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:37,426
that's enough.
Mr. Locke has work to do today.

470
00:36:39,812 --> 00:36:42,034
We'll let you know if anything develops.

471
00:36:44,879 --> 00:36:48,232
We have got ourselves quite a day
ahead of us, my friend.

472
00:36:48,805 --> 00:36:51,030
It's finally time
to get you up out of that bed.

473
00:36:51,296 --> 00:36:52,807
No. I don't want to.

474
00:36:52,928 --> 00:36:54,123
I don't remember asking.

475
00:37:00,088 --> 00:37:01,088
Now...

476
00:37:01,741 --> 00:37:03,815
Most people struggle with this at first,

477
00:37:03,968 --> 00:37:05,100
but don't worry.

478
00:37:05,946 --> 00:37:07,168
You'll get used to it.

479
00:37:08,911 --> 00:37:10,890
No, please. I can't do this.

480
00:37:12,019 --> 00:37:13,958
You fell eight stories and survived.

481
00:37:15,159 --> 00:37:17,004
I don't want to hear
about what you can't do.

482
00:37:17,222 --> 00:37:18,360
Now let's go.

483
00:37:18,365 --> 00:37:19,430
It's gonna be all right.

484
00:37:19,769 --> 00:37:20,868
It's gonna be fine, John.

485
00:37:20,869 --> 00:37:22,426
- Come on.
- No, I can't...

486
00:37:28,756 --> 00:37:29,984
You're fine...

487
00:37:32,383 --> 00:37:33,383
There we go.

488
00:37:34,198 --> 00:37:35,447
There you go, buddy.

489
00:37:37,195 --> 00:37:38,264
See?

490
00:37:39,393 --> 00:37:40,726
Wasn't that bad, was it?

491
00:37:41,555 --> 00:37:42,965
Be right back, buddy.

492
00:38:21,159 --> 00:38:23,770
Well, John,
you've really gone and done it now.

493
00:38:24,844 --> 00:38:27,721
You don't have to pretend
to be disappointed anymore.

494
00:38:28,267 --> 00:38:30,480
We both know you wanted it to happen.

495
00:38:31,869 --> 00:38:34,228
That's why you left the c4
in Sayid's bag

496
00:38:34,326 --> 00:38:36,658
Because you wanted me to make it happen.

497
00:38:38,282 --> 00:38:39,785
Uncuff him, please, Richard.

498
00:38:46,301 --> 00:38:47,912
You gonna do anything stupid?

499
00:38:49,261 --> 00:38:50,261
No, sir.

500
00:38:56,024 --> 00:38:59,520
Do you remember earlier, John,
when you called me a cheater...

501
00:39:00,471 --> 00:39:03,461
When you said I didn't deserve
to live on this island? Well, get this--

502
00:39:03,684 --> 00:39:06,046
There I was, shaking hands with Jack

503
00:39:06,613 --> 00:39:09,075
and thinking I'd give almost anything
to come up with a way

504
00:39:09,152 --> 00:39:11,770
to stop him from leaving,
because to let him go

505
00:39:12,342 --> 00:39:14,902
would be a sign a weakness,
of failure, of defeat.

506
00:39:15,427 --> 00:39:17,929
My people would see that.
They would know it,

507
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:20,246
and that, John, would be the end of me.

508
00:39:20,735 --> 00:39:21,735
But to kill him...

509
00:39:24,141 --> 00:39:25,469
That would be cheating,

510
00:39:26,154 --> 00:39:28,219
because my people
also heard me make a promise,

511
00:39:28,220 --> 00:39:29,612
and to break my word...

512
00:39:31,204 --> 00:39:33,037
that would be the end of me, too.

513
00:39:36,822 --> 00:39:40,361
And then you came striding out
of the jungle, John...

514
00:39:42,775 --> 00:39:45,157
to you make my dream come true.

515
00:39:48,087 --> 00:39:51,642
You're not gonna start talking
about the magic box again, are you?

516
00:39:55,769 --> 00:39:57,781
I'm gonna show you what came out of it.

517
00:40:10,517 --> 00:40:12,368
When I asked you earlier if it hurt

518
00:40:12,369 --> 00:40:15,456
when you suffered your injury,
I think you misunderstood me.

519
00:40:15,636 --> 00:40:18,852
It seems fairly obvious
that when a person's back smashes

520
00:40:18,876 --> 00:40:21,206
into a hard surface after being thrown
from a building,

521
00:40:21,265 --> 00:40:22,980
that's gonna sting a little.

522
00:40:23,448 --> 00:40:26,062
But I really wasn't asking
about the physical pain.

523
00:40:27,351 --> 00:40:29,317
What, do you want to know
if it hurt my feelings?

524
00:40:29,352 --> 00:40:31,891
No, John.
I wanted to know what it felt like

525
00:40:31,959 --> 00:40:34,125
when your own father tried to kill you.

526
00:40:37,719 --> 00:40:40,628
He's the reason you destroyed
the submarine, isn't he?

527
00:40:41,974 --> 00:40:42,974
You're afraid.

528
00:40:43,826 --> 00:40:47,179
You're afraid of him, and this is
the one place he can never find you.

529
00:40:47,264 --> 00:40:49,231
This is the one place
he can never get to.

530
00:40:49,232 --> 00:40:50,620
What do you want from me?

531
00:40:54,142 --> 00:40:55,598
I don't know how it happened...

532
00:40:57,847 --> 00:41:01,599
But you seem to have
some communion with this island, John,

533
00:41:02,029 --> 00:41:04,142
and that makes you very, very important.

534
00:41:05,611 --> 00:41:07,806
You have no idea
what you're talking about, of course,

535
00:41:07,841 --> 00:41:10,880
but in time you'll have
a better understanding of things.

536
00:41:12,865 --> 00:41:13,865
So what do I want?

537
00:41:15,623 --> 00:41:17,011
I want to help you, John.

538
00:41:19,624 --> 00:41:20,645
Why?

539
00:41:22,132 --> 00:41:24,576
Because I'm in a wheelchair,
and you're not.

540
00:41:31,296 --> 00:41:32,462
Are you ready to see?

541
00:42:14,053 --> 00:42:15,053
Dad?
