2
00:00:02,274 --> 00:00:03,897
Desmond said I was gonna die.

3
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:06,674
He told me he has
these flashes... visions.

4
00:00:06,824 --> 00:00:09,911
When I saw the lightning hit the roof,
you were electrocuted.

5
00:00:10,033 --> 00:00:11,798
And when you heard
Claire was in the water,

6
00:00:11,828 --> 00:00:14,753
you drowned trying to save her.
I dove in myself, so you never went in.

7
00:00:14,875 --> 00:00:16,399
No matter what I try to do,

8
00:00:16,535 --> 00:00:17,952
you're gonna die, Charlie.

9
00:00:18,074 --> 00:00:19,428
There's a woman in Hurley's tent

10
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:21,418
who parachuted
onto the island yesterday.

11
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:24,508
She says that the boat she took off from
is about 80 miles off the coast,

12
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:27,600
and if she can find a way to contact it,
we'll all be rescued.

13
00:00:27,722 --> 00:00:29,028
Why didn't anyone tell me this?

14
00:00:29,232 --> 00:00:30,719
Because they don't trust you.

15
00:00:31,074 --> 00:00:32,159
<i>Kwon is pregnant.</i>

16
00:00:32,314 --> 00:00:33,314
Where'd you get that?

17
00:00:33,427 --> 00:00:35,761
You really think
you're in a position to ask questions?

18
00:00:35,785 --> 00:00:37,803
I told Jack what they were making me do.

19
00:00:37,972 --> 00:00:39,249
Why didn't you tell us?

20
00:00:39,472 --> 00:00:41,849
Because I hadn't decided
what to do about it yet.

21
00:01:17,761 --> 00:01:19,173
Anyone wants to venture a guess

22
00:01:19,298 --> 00:01:22,136
as to what Jack's gonna be showing us
out in the middle of nowhere?

23
00:01:22,447 --> 00:01:23,927
I don't know. Stuff.

24
00:01:25,072 --> 00:01:26,294
Probably secret stuff.

25
00:01:27,253 --> 00:01:29,200
Why does everything
have to be such a secret?

26
00:01:29,322 --> 00:01:31,183
How about some openness
for a change?

27
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:33,892
We kept the parachute lady secret.

28
00:01:34,014 --> 00:01:35,180
Ah, that's different.

29
00:01:35,325 --> 00:01:36,325
Different how?

30
00:01:36,823 --> 00:01:39,616
Well, because we weren't out there
playing football with them.

31
00:01:40,014 --> 00:01:41,014
What?

32
00:01:42,347 --> 00:01:43,386
Nothing.

33
00:01:43,512 --> 00:01:44,512
Wait.

34
00:01:46,119 --> 00:01:48,061
You had one of your flashes
again, didn't you?

35
00:01:48,824 --> 00:01:50,046
No, Charlie, I didn't.

36
00:01:53,697 --> 00:01:54,697
We're here.

37
00:02:07,199 --> 00:02:08,496
A couple of nights ago,

38
00:02:09,510 --> 00:02:11,497
Juliet came to me,
and she told me everything...

39
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:15,807
That Ben had sent her here to find out
which of our women were pregnant.

40
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:17,671
So what, you guys
were doing tests on us?

41
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:20,116
No, but that's what he wanted me to do.

42
00:02:21,197 --> 00:02:24,199
I've been leaving tapes
at the medical station.

43
00:02:24,847 --> 00:02:26,198
You all heard what he said.

44
00:02:26,324 --> 00:02:27,657
They're coming tomorrow.

45
00:02:29,085 --> 00:02:31,811
Sun, I'm sorry that I lied to you.

46
00:02:33,012 --> 00:02:34,777
While I appreciate your honesty, Jack,

47
00:02:35,199 --> 00:02:37,384
it doesn't explain
why you brought us out here.

48
00:02:51,574 --> 00:02:52,574
Show 'em.

49
00:03:14,323 --> 00:03:16,349
When Juliet told me they where coming,

50
00:03:17,325 --> 00:03:18,910
the first thing I thought was,

51
00:03:19,738 --> 00:03:21,657
where the hell
are we gonna hide this time?

52
00:03:22,338 --> 00:03:23,667
But hiding's pointless.

53
00:03:23,885 --> 00:03:25,697
They're just gonna keep coming back.

54
00:03:26,698 --> 00:03:28,559
So I went out, and I found some help.

55
00:03:29,642 --> 00:03:30,689
And for the past few days,

56
00:03:30,811 --> 00:03:33,110
she's been bringing dynamite
back from "the black rock."

57
00:03:33,803 --> 00:03:34,839
For the very first time,

58
00:03:34,961 --> 00:03:38,106
we know exactly what they want,
when they're coming to get it,

59
00:03:38,259 --> 00:03:40,079
and they have no idea

60
00:03:41,217 --> 00:03:42,738
that we're gonna be waiting for 'em.

61
00:03:44,778 --> 00:03:47,209
So Juliet's gonna mark the tents
with the white rocks,

62
00:03:47,331 --> 00:03:48,523
just like she was told to,

63
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:52,353
but there's not gonna be
any pregnant women inside.

64
00:03:52,475 --> 00:03:54,691
There's gonna be plenty
of what we used on that tree.

65
00:03:55,952 --> 00:03:57,138
So tomorrow night...

66
00:03:58,528 --> 00:03:59,528
We stop hiding.

67
00:03:59,967 --> 00:04:01,012
We stop running.

68
00:04:01,134 --> 00:04:04,245
We stop living in fear of them,
because when they show up...

69
00:04:07,527 --> 00:04:09,360
we're gonna blow 'em all to hell.

70
00:04:10,711 --> 00:04:22,682
Subtitles: swsub.com

71
00:04:32,158 --> 00:04:33,158
Bloody hell!

72
00:04:33,719 --> 00:04:35,222
Why are we even doing this?

73
00:04:35,344 --> 00:04:36,344
Chin up, mate.

74
00:04:36,625 --> 00:04:38,408
- We're headlining.
- Headlining?

75
00:04:38,891 --> 00:04:40,242
We're playing Clitheroe...

76
00:04:40,469 --> 00:04:41,723
The arse end of nowhere.

77
00:04:41,845 --> 00:04:42,845
A gig's a gig.

78
00:04:43,222 --> 00:04:44,456
We're building our fan base.

79
00:04:44,598 --> 00:04:47,034
Will our fan base pay
for a new sodding tire?

80
00:04:47,348 --> 00:04:48,586
Only if we show up.

81
00:04:49,503 --> 00:04:51,501
So let's just get on with it, shall we?

82
00:04:52,370 --> 00:04:53,579
You know what, Liam?

83
00:04:53,741 --> 00:04:54,899
You get on with it.

84
00:04:55,095 --> 00:04:56,095
I quit.

85
00:04:56,533 --> 00:04:58,892
- You're giving up?
- There's nothing to give up on!

86
00:04:59,283 --> 00:05:02,280
We're broke! The album's not selling!
We're a bloody joke!

87
00:05:02,402 --> 00:05:03,469
Hey, shut it!

88
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:05,721
Listen.

89
00:05:10,854 --> 00:05:11,955
That's us.

90
00:05:15,399 --> 00:05:16,557
We're on the radio!

91
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:21,288
That we are.

92
00:05:21,447 --> 00:05:23,200
We're on the bloody radio!

93
00:05:28,716 --> 00:05:30,127
I told you, baby brother!

94
00:05:30,249 --> 00:05:31,895
We're gonna be bloody rock stars.

95
00:05:39,246 --> 00:05:40,393
Can I ask you something?

96
00:05:43,949 --> 00:05:45,966
Who are you people
about to go to war with?

97
00:05:46,918 --> 00:05:48,266
Oh, that's a long story.

98
00:05:48,388 --> 00:05:49,874
Want to ask me something else?

99
00:05:50,657 --> 00:05:51,724
You having a laugh?

100
00:05:52,528 --> 00:05:53,635
Of course not.

101
00:05:53,942 --> 00:05:55,963
I'd never disrespect a fellow Mancunian.

102
00:05:56,918 --> 00:05:59,064
- You're from Manchester, then?
- I am.

103
00:05:59,264 --> 00:06:02,123
My band got its start at
the night and day bar on Oldham street.

104
00:06:02,691 --> 00:06:04,766
- What band?
- We were called Drive Shaft.

105
00:06:05,885 --> 00:06:07,162
Yeah. Yeah, I know you.

106
00:06:07,485 --> 00:06:09,286
We had our moment in the sun.

107
00:06:09,408 --> 00:06:10,816
No, not that... the crash.

108
00:06:11,197 --> 00:06:12,481
You're the dead rock star.

109
00:06:12,629 --> 00:06:15,013
They made a big deal out of you
when they found the plane.

110
00:06:15,321 --> 00:06:17,174
Huge memorial service, new album.

111
00:06:17,359 --> 00:06:18,361
There's a new album?

112
00:06:18,483 --> 00:06:20,254
Yeah. God, it was everywhere...

113
00:06:20,427 --> 00:06:21,766
A "greatest hits" thing.

114
00:06:27,577 --> 00:06:29,398
Hey, look on the bright side.

115
00:06:29,828 --> 00:06:31,383
You're not really dead, right?

116
00:06:33,264 --> 00:06:34,264
Yeah, right.

117
00:06:58,363 --> 00:06:59,531
We need more wire,

118
00:07:00,423 --> 00:07:02,509
so we can trigger these
from a safe distance.

119
00:07:02,631 --> 00:07:04,847
I can get people to start
stripping the plane wreckage.

120
00:07:04,890 --> 00:07:07,718
Good. I should be able
to finish rigging these tents

121
00:07:07,878 --> 00:07:09,127
in the next 24 hours.

122
00:07:09,643 --> 00:07:11,335
We'll be ready by tomorrow night.

123
00:07:17,295 --> 00:07:18,867
We need to talk about Naomi's phone.

124
00:07:18,989 --> 00:07:20,759
- Not now.
- If you're angry I doubted you,

125
00:07:20,881 --> 00:07:22,905
I'd be happy to make
a sincere apology later,

126
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:25,794
- but now we have a means...
- Look, I'm a little bit busy right now.

127
00:07:25,916 --> 00:07:28,277
And I am trying to get us
off this island!

128
00:07:32,273 --> 00:07:33,672
I can't transmit using this phone

129
00:07:33,794 --> 00:07:36,575
because Danielle's distress signal
is overriding the frequency.

130
00:07:37,882 --> 00:07:39,578
If you tell me where the radio tower is,

131
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:42,193
I can go there, switch off
your message and call for help.

132
00:07:42,329 --> 00:07:44,783
My signal has been playing
for the last 16 years,

133
00:07:44,905 --> 00:07:46,051
and nobody has heard it.

134
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:47,954
Why do you think
you'll have better luck?

135
00:07:48,076 --> 00:07:51,401
Naomi's boat is only 80 miles offshore.

136
00:07:52,372 --> 00:07:54,783
I know if we eliminate
Danielle's signal, they'll hear us.

137
00:07:54,828 --> 00:07:55,890
No, they won't.

138
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:57,700
And why is that?

139
00:07:58,788 --> 00:07:59,832
We're jamming it.

140
00:08:00,258 --> 00:08:01,258
What?

141
00:08:01,336 --> 00:08:03,010
Ben is using one of the Dharma stations

142
00:08:03,035 --> 00:08:05,549
to block all of the signals off
of the island except for ours.

143
00:08:05,575 --> 00:08:06,575
What station?

144
00:08:06,951 --> 00:08:08,554
They call it the "Looking Glass."

145
00:08:09,352 --> 00:08:10,686
- The looking glass?
- Yes.

146
00:08:10,808 --> 00:08:12,963
But it's underwater.
I have no idea where it is.

147
00:08:15,325 --> 00:08:16,325
I believe I do.

148
00:08:18,514 --> 00:08:20,454
Look, I know...
I know Jack thinks it's best,

149
00:08:20,576 --> 00:08:23,070
but, you know, what if
they're coming for him again?

150
00:08:25,576 --> 00:08:26,742
Claire, listen to me.

151
00:08:27,575 --> 00:08:28,797
I'm gonna protect you.

152
00:08:29,327 --> 00:08:30,783
I'm gonna protect Aaron.

153
00:08:32,219 --> 00:08:33,326
I promise.

154
00:08:34,210 --> 00:08:36,215
Look, everything is gonna be fine.

155
00:08:41,298 --> 00:08:42,309
Sorry.

156
00:08:44,526 --> 00:08:46,145
Can you give me a hand with something?

157
00:08:48,653 --> 00:08:49,709
Of course.

158
00:09:02,688 --> 00:09:05,072
So you ready to tell me
what you saw this morning?

159
00:09:05,887 --> 00:09:06,887
Aye.

160
00:09:08,138 --> 00:09:10,431
Right. So how does it happen this time?

161
00:09:14,389 --> 00:09:15,389
Come on, Des!

162
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:17,464
You can tell me. I can take it.

163
00:09:22,628 --> 00:09:24,128
What I saw, Charlie, was...

164
00:09:25,751 --> 00:09:27,930
Claire and her baby
getting into a helicopter...

165
00:09:29,066 --> 00:09:30,177
A helicopter that...

166
00:09:31,878 --> 00:09:34,490
That lifts off, leaves this island.

167
00:09:40,751 --> 00:09:41,751
You sure?

168
00:09:42,317 --> 00:09:43,317
Aye.

169
00:09:43,817 --> 00:09:44,928
Rescue helicopter...

170
00:09:45,501 --> 00:09:46,501
On this beach?

171
00:09:46,815 --> 00:09:48,307
This island? That's what you saw?

172
00:09:50,751 --> 00:09:52,362
We're getting bloody rescued!

173
00:09:52,918 --> 00:09:55,291
I thought you were gonna tell me
I was gonna die again.

174
00:10:00,689 --> 00:10:01,689
You are, Charlie.

175
00:10:04,030 --> 00:10:05,251
Wait. What?

176
00:10:06,881 --> 00:10:08,000
If you don't...

177
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,449
none of it will happen.

178
00:10:12,471 --> 00:10:13,915
There won't be any rescue.

179
00:10:17,407 --> 00:10:18,508
I'm sorry, brother...

180
00:10:19,766 --> 00:10:20,778
but this time...

181
00:10:23,897 --> 00:10:25,497
This time you have to die.

182
00:10:35,697 --> 00:10:36,753
Come on!

183
00:10:41,246 --> 00:10:43,392
Come on, Charlie. Jump in!

184
00:10:44,051 --> 00:10:45,384
I'm gonna catch you, boy.

185
00:10:46,487 --> 00:10:48,566
No. You're just going to back away.

186
00:10:48,772 --> 00:10:50,460
Don't be daft. Jump in!

187
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:55,607
I promise, Charlie. I'm gonna catch you.

188
00:10:55,897 --> 00:10:56,936
No, he won't!

189
00:10:57,648 --> 00:10:58,648
Zip it, you.

190
00:11:00,134 --> 00:11:01,859
Look, don't listen to your brother.

191
00:11:02,272 --> 00:11:03,334
Just jump on in.

192
00:11:06,334 --> 00:11:08,480
There's nothing to be afraid of,
Charlie.

193
00:11:10,023 --> 00:11:12,199
I'll catch you. I promise.

194
00:11:35,487 --> 00:11:36,583
I did it!

195
00:11:38,049 --> 00:11:39,108
You got it!

196
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:41,801
- I did it.
- You're swimming, Charlie.

197
00:11:50,424 --> 00:11:51,503
What you writing?

198
00:11:59,457 --> 00:12:00,457
Nothing.

199
00:12:08,207 --> 00:12:09,262
All right, tell me.

200
00:12:12,394 --> 00:12:14,060
Are you sure you want to know?

201
00:12:16,173 --> 00:12:18,031
I mean, it might be easier
if you just...

202
00:12:19,682 --> 00:12:20,874
I want to know.

203
00:12:24,765 --> 00:12:25,991
You're inside a hatch.

204
00:12:26,323 --> 00:12:27,425
It's...

205
00:12:28,913 --> 00:12:30,301
a room full of equipment.

206
00:12:31,352 --> 00:12:32,916
There's a blinking yellow light

207
00:12:33,245 --> 00:12:34,621
above a switch.

208
00:12:35,315 --> 00:12:36,524
You flip the switch.

209
00:12:38,791 --> 00:12:39,791
Light goes off.

210
00:12:45,906 --> 00:12:47,030
And then you drown.

211
00:12:58,790 --> 00:12:59,790
When?

212
00:13:03,232 --> 00:13:04,351
I don't know.

213
00:13:04,725 --> 00:13:07,186
You're sure you saw Claire and Aaron
get on that helicopter?

214
00:13:07,476 --> 00:13:08,476
Aye.

215
00:13:11,228 --> 00:13:12,228
So...

216
00:13:14,475 --> 00:13:16,432
before I... drown...

217
00:13:18,526 --> 00:13:20,047
I just have to flip a switch?

218
00:13:22,192 --> 00:13:23,236
That's right.

219
00:13:27,915 --> 00:13:28,915
Where is it, then?

220
00:13:33,277 --> 00:13:34,956
Now this is the Looking Glass.

221
00:13:35,601 --> 00:13:37,175
It's an underwater Dharma station.

222
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:40,601
Please, can you tell me anything
you might know about this place?

223
00:13:40,796 --> 00:13:42,146
I've never been down there.

224
00:13:42,459 --> 00:13:43,912
I don't know anyone who has.

225
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:45,600
Why not?

226
00:13:46,183 --> 00:13:47,636
There was some accident.

227
00:13:48,149 --> 00:13:50,473
Ben told us that the station
was completely flooded.

228
00:13:50,606 --> 00:13:52,656
Well, if it's flooded,
then how does it still work?

229
00:13:52,798 --> 00:13:54,308
How it still works is irrelevant.

230
00:13:54,475 --> 00:13:56,755
The question is, how do
we get it to stop working,

231
00:13:56,915 --> 00:13:58,613
so we could use the satellite phone?

232
00:14:01,275 --> 00:14:03,123
The diagram shows
that the looking glass

233
00:14:03,273 --> 00:14:05,136
is connected to the island by a cable.

234
00:14:05,914 --> 00:14:07,769
I feel sure that this is
the very same cable

235
00:14:07,914 --> 00:14:09,955
down the beach
which runs into the ocean.

236
00:14:10,404 --> 00:14:13,066
So if we follow the cable,
it should lead us to the station.

237
00:14:13,317 --> 00:14:14,873
So how are we gonna get in?

238
00:14:15,085 --> 00:14:16,174
We swim in.

239
00:14:16,463 --> 00:14:17,655
There's a moon pool...

240
00:14:18,872 --> 00:14:21,200
A room with an open floor
at the base of the station...

241
00:14:21,409 --> 00:14:23,339
Big enough
for a submarine to dock.

242
00:14:23,621 --> 00:14:25,188
Even if the station's flooded,

243
00:14:25,828 --> 00:14:28,314
I think I'll be able to find
the relay switch and disable it.

244
00:14:28,463 --> 00:14:30,049
What about swimming back out?

245
00:14:33,333 --> 00:14:35,424
No. I'm not letting you
go on some suicide mission

246
00:14:35,603 --> 00:14:36,800
just to flip the switch.

247
00:14:36,923 --> 00:14:39,251
Someone has to do it,
or we'll never leave this island.

248
00:14:39,429 --> 00:14:40,429
I'll do it.

249
00:14:40,934 --> 00:14:43,375
I can swim down, turn off that
bloody switch, swim back up.

250
00:14:43,443 --> 00:14:44,454
Piece of cake.

251
00:14:44,491 --> 00:14:46,693
Charlie, you don't even know
what we're talking about.

252
00:14:46,784 --> 00:14:48,964
I was junior swim champion
in northern England.

253
00:14:49,089 --> 00:14:50,490
I can hold my breath for 4 minutes.

254
00:14:50,558 --> 00:14:52,340
I know exactly what
you're talking about.

255
00:14:57,088 --> 00:14:59,211
No, and there's no reason
to do this now.

256
00:14:59,268 --> 00:15:01,811
We're gonna focus on the others,
and then we'll deal with this.

257
00:15:01,856 --> 00:15:04,213
Wait a minute.
We have a chance to signal for a rescue.

258
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:07,909
Look, for 90 days, I've been asked
to make decisions for this entire camp.

259
00:15:08,597 --> 00:15:10,254
There you go.
I just made one.

260
00:15:19,859 --> 00:15:21,426
Rose, that's a sailor's hitch.

261
00:15:21,993 --> 00:15:24,697
It's not gonna hold.
You wanna do a sheet bend like mine.

262
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:26,434
Oh, so now you're a knot expert.

263
00:15:27,114 --> 00:15:28,449
Well, trust me, it's...

264
00:15:33,563 --> 00:15:34,664
How did you do that?

265
00:15:35,595 --> 00:15:37,003
Watch and learn, dear.

266
00:16:43,019 --> 00:16:44,468
Look there!
Look!

267
00:17:01,294 --> 00:17:02,663
Get off him, damn it!
It's okay.

268
00:17:02,708 --> 00:17:05,656
- What? He's one of them!
- I know! It's okay.

269
00:17:07,465 --> 00:17:08,861
He was in the cage next to me.

270
00:17:09,736 --> 00:17:10,928
I know this guy.

271
00:17:11,610 --> 00:17:13,197
What the hell are you doing here, Karl?

272
00:17:14,190 --> 00:17:15,496
They're... coming...

273
00:17:16,450 --> 00:17:17,472
My people.

274
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:20,097
Sorry you came all this way for nothing,
but we already know.

275
00:17:20,233 --> 00:17:21,462
Then why are you still here?

276
00:17:21,508 --> 00:17:24,418
'cause when they'll show up tomorrow
night, we're gonna be ready for 'em.

277
00:17:24,419 --> 00:17:27,470
Tomorrow? No, no,
they're coming tonight.

278
00:17:34,408 --> 00:17:35,868
They're coming right now!

279
00:17:40,035 --> 00:17:43,801
SIX HOURS AGO (del vo)

280
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,422
When did you get back?

281
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:50,705
Just now.

282
00:17:52,952 --> 00:17:53,952
Where's Locke?

283
00:17:56,973 --> 00:17:58,165
Here's your gun back.

284
00:18:03,567 --> 00:18:04,588
Ben, what's going on?

285
00:18:04,641 --> 00:18:05,641
Where's Ryan?

286
00:18:06,290 --> 00:18:07,494
He's in his tent. Are you...

287
00:18:07,562 --> 00:18:08,890
It's time to get them.

288
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:11,554
But you said tomorrow.

289
00:18:11,765 --> 00:18:13,376
Jacob wants it to happen now.

290
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:15,548
Look, what happened out there?

291
00:18:15,578 --> 00:18:17,352
- Did john see...
- John had an accident.

292
00:18:20,203 --> 00:18:21,203
Ryan?

293
00:18:21,327 --> 00:18:22,327
Yes, sir?

294
00:18:22,734 --> 00:18:23,829
If you leave right now,

295
00:18:23,886 --> 00:18:25,805
how long will it take you
to reach their camp?

296
00:18:26,302 --> 00:18:29,128
Well, if I take my ten best,
we could set up to hit 'em by nightfall.

297
00:18:29,219 --> 00:18:31,295
- Then you better get going.
- No, Ben, wait.

298
00:18:31,465 --> 00:18:32,549
Moving up the schedule...

299
00:18:32,618 --> 00:18:34,831
Juliet may not be ready.
What if she hasn't had time...

300
00:18:34,888 --> 00:18:36,591
Then we'll take all their women...

301
00:18:38,318 --> 00:18:40,214
And we'll sort out
the ones we need later.

302
00:18:40,817 --> 00:18:41,873
And the men?

303
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:44,488
If any of 'em are stupid enough
to get in your way,

304
00:18:45,139 --> 00:18:46,139
kill 'em.

305
00:18:47,125 --> 00:18:48,135
All right.

306
00:19:00,536 --> 00:19:01,592
Karl!

307
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:05,140
It's me!

308
00:19:08,443 --> 00:19:09,828
I thought you were bringing rabbit.

309
00:19:09,874 --> 00:19:11,917
You have to go... now.

310
00:19:12,326 --> 00:19:14,313
What? Did he find out I was out here?

311
00:19:14,517 --> 00:19:16,892
No, but he's sending Pryce
to their beach camp right now,

312
00:19:17,015 --> 00:19:18,111
and you have to warn them.

313
00:19:18,161 --> 00:19:19,542
- Warn them?
- You have to go now!

314
00:19:19,592 --> 00:19:21,805
I thought they were just gonna
take the pregnant women.

315
00:19:21,835 --> 00:19:22,861
If you take the outrigger,

316
00:19:22,883 --> 00:19:24,559
you'll get there
a few hours before them.

317
00:19:24,914 --> 00:19:27,266
- Wait, Alex...
- He's gonna kill them Karl!

318
00:19:31,202 --> 00:19:32,979
Austen and Ford saved your life.

319
00:19:36,891 --> 00:19:37,891
You owe them.

320
00:19:41,895 --> 00:19:43,053
You better take this.

321
00:19:46,215 --> 00:19:48,463
If I get caught, your father's
gonna kill me this time.

322
00:19:48,703 --> 00:19:49,742
Is he my father?

323
00:19:59,376 --> 00:20:00,518
Now go.

324
00:20:26,625 --> 00:20:27,828
Is that everything?

325
00:20:31,055 --> 00:20:32,151
Can we trust him?

326
00:20:32,471 --> 00:20:33,538
You don't trust me?

327
00:20:33,743 --> 00:20:34,743
What about her?

328
00:20:35,241 --> 00:20:36,326
She's a spy.

329
00:20:37,523 --> 00:20:40,691
She's supposed to mark the tents
of the pregnant women with white rocks

330
00:20:40,813 --> 00:20:43,318
- so they can take them.
- They know, Karl, but thanks.

331
00:20:45,257 --> 00:20:47,698
- So what are we gonna do?
- We have to leave now... Hide.

332
00:20:48,053 --> 00:20:50,873
Where? It's their island.
f they wanna kill us, they'll find us.

333
00:20:52,990 --> 00:20:54,964
The sun's gonna go down in a few hours.

334
00:20:55,583 --> 00:20:57,740
- Do we have enough wire yet?
- Not even close.

335
00:20:58,205 --> 00:21:00,518
We have to find out another way
to set the dynamite off.

336
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,431
- We can shoot.
- We don't have enough guns.

337
00:21:02,553 --> 00:21:03,808
Ten of them are coming, armed.

338
00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:05,361
Not the others... the tents.

339
00:21:05,483 --> 00:21:07,618
We can camouflage the dynamite
next to the tents,

340
00:21:07,748 --> 00:21:10,030
target it from our positions
at the tree line.

341
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:14,716
Juliet marked three tents.
That means we need three guns.

342
00:21:16,236 --> 00:21:18,063
Here. You can have mine, too.

343
00:21:20,198 --> 00:21:21,276
I'll be your third.

344
00:21:23,101 --> 00:21:25,121
I'll take your gun,
but you're not staying here.

345
00:21:27,650 --> 00:21:30,118
You're gonna lead everyone
to the radio tower... Everyone.

346
00:21:30,277 --> 00:21:31,301
The radio tower?

347
00:21:31,432 --> 00:21:33,582
If this doesn't work,
we can't risk losing the chance

348
00:21:33,704 --> 00:21:35,316
of getting in contact with Naomi's boat,

349
00:21:35,438 --> 00:21:37,577
so everything has to happen
at the same time.

350
00:21:42,842 --> 00:21:44,047
You still up for a swim?

351
00:21:47,403 --> 00:21:48,569
Yeah, I believe I am.

352
00:21:50,715 --> 00:21:51,715
I'll go with him.

353
00:21:52,902 --> 00:21:55,135
Okay, better get to it.

354
00:22:11,656 --> 00:22:12,996
It's here, baby brother.

355
00:22:13,301 --> 00:22:14,340
Christmas is here.

356
00:22:17,465 --> 00:22:19,327
Are these the birds from row two?

357
00:22:21,327 --> 00:22:22,508
Well done, mate.

358
00:22:28,388 --> 00:22:30,182
Well, as you have spent another year

359
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:33,380
as the only drug-free
rock star in the world,

360
00:22:33,692 --> 00:22:35,826
I'm gonna share
a little-known fact with you.

361
00:22:38,586 --> 00:22:41,867
Father christmas lives
just down the street from here.

362
00:22:42,048 --> 00:22:43,660
Father christmas lives in Helsinki?

363
00:22:43,804 --> 00:22:44,962
Indeed he does,

364
00:22:45,110 --> 00:22:46,991
and in case you haven't noticed,
baby brother,

365
00:22:47,366 --> 00:22:49,398
Finland is the bloody north pole.

366
00:22:52,072 --> 00:22:55,909
Therefore, I have a very special
gift for you this year.

367
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,967
Liam, no. Mum gave you that.

368
00:23:04,286 --> 00:23:05,410
You're the firstborn.

369
00:23:05,998 --> 00:23:08,693
It was her father's
and his father before that.

370
00:23:08,815 --> 00:23:11,134
And it's a family heirloom,
and at's why we named the band

371
00:23:11,275 --> 00:23:12,461
after Dexter bloody Stratton.

372
00:23:12,602 --> 00:23:13,653
I know.

373
00:23:13,821 --> 00:23:15,955
But, Charlie, let's be honest.

374
00:23:17,778 --> 00:23:19,555
We both know I'm a sodding mess.

375
00:23:20,089 --> 00:23:22,075
But you... You're different.

376
00:23:22,485 --> 00:23:24,684
You're gonna get married,
have a family...

377
00:23:25,652 --> 00:23:26,754
A baby.

378
00:23:28,152 --> 00:23:29,488
I'll be lucky if I hit 30.

379
00:23:29,610 --> 00:23:30,734
Don't say that, Lee.

380
00:23:31,371 --> 00:23:33,880
The ring has to stay
in the family, Charlie.

381
00:23:35,404 --> 00:23:36,404
So, please...

382
00:23:37,965 --> 00:23:38,965
Take it.

383
00:23:40,341 --> 00:23:42,056
Mum would have wanted it this way.

384
00:23:42,653 --> 00:23:44,690
Pass it on to your little one someday.

385
00:23:45,392 --> 00:23:47,083
I need to know it's safe.

386
00:23:54,327 --> 00:23:55,565
I'll hold on to it...

387
00:23:58,852 --> 00:24:00,015
but I won't take it.

388
00:24:03,937 --> 00:24:05,777
Hey, it fits. Look at that.

389
00:24:08,202 --> 00:24:09,610
Happy christmas, baby brother.

390
00:24:41,404 --> 00:24:42,449
You need some help?

391
00:24:44,344 --> 00:24:46,478
Why didn't you tell me
you were gonna do this?

392
00:24:52,208 --> 00:24:53,582
I didn't want you to worry.

393
00:24:55,199 --> 00:24:56,720
Well, it's dangerous, isn't it,

394
00:24:56,864 --> 00:24:58,863
swimming into some underwater station?

395
00:24:59,562 --> 00:25:02,435
It's what needs to be done
to get us all rescued.

396
00:25:05,030 --> 00:25:06,196
I'll be fine, Claire.

397
00:25:07,510 --> 00:25:09,179
But you gotta promise me something.

398
00:25:10,949 --> 00:25:11,966
While I'm gone...

399
00:25:15,469 --> 00:25:16,729
Don't worry about me.

400
00:25:30,002 --> 00:25:31,047
I'll take him.

401
00:25:33,982 --> 00:25:34,982
Thanks.

402
00:25:41,695 --> 00:25:42,977
Alright, turnip head.

403
00:25:44,923 --> 00:25:46,654
Now you take care of your mum

404
00:25:47,663 --> 00:25:48,889
while I'm away, okay?

405
00:25:58,793 --> 00:25:59,793
I love you.

406
00:26:19,604 --> 00:26:20,637
See you soon.

407
00:26:24,617 --> 00:26:25,780
Be careful, Charlie.

408
00:26:27,082 --> 00:26:28,108
Okay?

409
00:27:22,841 --> 00:27:23,976
Sorry, guys.

410
00:27:24,333 --> 00:27:25,406
Thanks, man.

411
00:27:35,661 --> 00:27:37,932
Help! Help me!

412
00:27:41,563 --> 00:27:42,653
Please!

413
00:27:44,864 --> 00:27:45,874
You, stop!

414
00:27:46,623 --> 00:27:48,236
Get the hell away from her!

415
00:27:49,264 --> 00:27:50,267
What are you doing?

416
00:27:50,389 --> 00:27:51,389
Leave her alone!

417
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:55,640
You okay, miss?

418
00:27:56,201 --> 00:27:58,186
Yes. I think so, yes.

419
00:28:00,577 --> 00:28:01,577
Here you go.

420
00:28:03,218 --> 00:28:04,766
Pardon me while I have a heart attack.

421
00:28:04,888 --> 00:28:07,122
The last time I was in a fight,
I was 8 years old.

422
00:28:10,270 --> 00:28:11,389
And I lost.

423
00:28:12,606 --> 00:28:16,012
Well, that makes you even more
of a hero, doesn't it?

424
00:28:16,888 --> 00:28:18,372
I just did what anyone would do.

425
00:28:19,083 --> 00:28:21,422
Three people walked by the alley.

426
00:28:22,451 --> 00:28:23,553
- What?
- They saw me,

427
00:28:24,303 --> 00:28:25,710
but they just kept on going.

428
00:28:28,389 --> 00:28:29,982
You are a hero, sir...

429
00:28:31,576 --> 00:28:34,635
And don't let anyone ever
tell you differently.

430
00:28:50,892 --> 00:28:52,724
- What's that?
- It's a weight belt.

431
00:28:53,266 --> 00:28:55,610
It should bring you down
quicker than swimming.

432
00:28:57,004 --> 00:28:58,526
Well, every second counts.

433
00:29:00,328 --> 00:29:02,330
So I just take it off when I hit bottom,

434
00:29:02,893 --> 00:29:04,606
swim up through the moon pool,

435
00:29:04,951 --> 00:29:06,144
into the station,

436
00:29:07,150 --> 00:29:10,908
swim into whichever room
has the yellow blinking switch,

437
00:29:12,407 --> 00:29:13,485
flip it.

438
00:29:15,861 --> 00:29:16,885
Nothing to it.

439
00:29:21,584 --> 00:29:24,679
So how long
can you really hold your breath for?

440
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:27,890
Does it matter?

441
00:29:35,755 --> 00:29:38,526
- Do you want me to hit another one?
- No, you've made your point.

442
00:29:38,755 --> 00:29:41,818
Bernard, this is not pheasant hunting
in Montgomery county.

443
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:43,573
- I know what I'm doing.
- No.

444
00:29:43,695 --> 00:29:46,648
- Pheasants don't shoot back.
- Nothing's gonna happen to me, Rose.

445
00:29:46,942 --> 00:29:50,200
I just have to shoot a tent,
and I'll be right behind you.

446
00:29:50,670 --> 00:29:51,850
Then I'm staying, too.

447
00:29:52,705 --> 00:29:53,817
No, you're not, Rose.

448
00:29:55,963 --> 00:29:58,324
Everyone's gathering down
at the south end of the beach.

449
00:29:58,901 --> 00:30:00,586
No one's staying behind
but the shooters.

450
00:30:00,717 --> 00:30:02,839
Says who? You wanna give me your word

451
00:30:02,961 --> 00:30:05,869
that nothing's gonna happen
to my husband, then I'll go.

452
00:30:08,082 --> 00:30:10,193
I'll give you my word
that if we don't kill everyone

453
00:30:10,315 --> 00:30:12,076
who shows up here in about an hour,

454
00:30:12,387 --> 00:30:14,272
it's not gonna matter where Bernard is.

455
00:30:15,677 --> 00:30:17,891
I like you better
since you got back, Jack.

456
00:30:18,257 --> 00:30:19,790
You're almost an optimist.

457
00:30:20,676 --> 00:30:23,008
Come on.
If you're gonna be hiding in the bushes,

458
00:30:23,130 --> 00:30:24,772
let's get you into somethin' dark.

459
00:30:28,816 --> 00:30:30,046
You better get going.

460
00:30:30,756 --> 00:30:33,215
Rousseau says it's about
a day's walk up to the radio tower.

461
00:30:33,337 --> 00:30:35,608
I'm not taking them to the tower.
You are.

462
00:30:37,792 --> 00:30:40,068
- Excuse me?
- You're not staying behind.

463
00:30:41,444 --> 00:30:42,592
This was my idea.

464
00:30:42,714 --> 00:30:44,454
And I'm perfectly capable
of executing it.

465
00:30:44,576 --> 00:30:46,897
- I owe them!
- What are you more concerned with,

466
00:30:47,562 --> 00:30:50,525
killing the others
or getting our people off this island?

467
00:30:53,195 --> 00:30:55,348
This afternoon,
you said you were our leader.

468
00:31:00,317 --> 00:31:01,948
It's time for you to act like one.

469
00:31:06,755 --> 00:31:08,810
Lead them to the radio tower, Jack...

470
00:31:10,991 --> 00:31:12,513
and then take us all home.

471
00:31:23,897 --> 00:31:25,441
Dudes, wait!

472
00:31:30,435 --> 00:31:32,680
I heard what you're doing.
I wanna come with.

473
00:31:35,953 --> 00:31:38,893
Everyone...
They're all going to the radio tower,

474
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:43,470
and I'm sick of trekking and,
you know, explosions.

475
00:31:45,002 --> 00:31:46,682
I think I can help you guys out.

476
00:31:47,688 --> 00:31:49,130
I'm a really good paddler.

477
00:31:55,629 --> 00:31:56,795
You can't go, Hurley.

478
00:31:58,674 --> 00:31:59,756
Why not?

479
00:32:02,319 --> 00:32:03,319
Because...

480
00:32:05,913 --> 00:32:07,014
you're too big.

481
00:32:08,303 --> 00:32:09,744
You won't fit in the boat.

482
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:18,809
That's uncool, man.

483
00:32:21,834 --> 00:32:22,969
Wait.

484
00:32:27,537 --> 00:32:30,205
Dude, it's fine. I don't even
wanna go on your stupid boat.

485
00:32:36,487 --> 00:32:37,861
I'll catch up with you later.

486
00:32:38,868 --> 00:32:40,071
Just remember I love you, man.

487
00:32:41,131 --> 00:32:42,596
Yeah, whatever. I love you, too.

488
00:32:58,619 --> 00:33:00,309
You got water in there? Good, good.

489
00:33:00,898 --> 00:33:02,261
How about you? Bottled water?

490
00:33:02,708 --> 00:33:03,730
Good.

491
00:33:08,287 --> 00:33:09,573
So here we go again, huh?

492
00:33:11,413 --> 00:33:12,464
Here we go again.

493
00:33:16,098 --> 00:33:17,847
The tents are all marked. We're set.

494
00:33:18,774 --> 00:33:20,266
Sayid find the third shooter?

495
00:33:31,805 --> 00:33:33,778
Ready, Claire?
Need a hand with the little guy?

496
00:33:34,302 --> 00:33:35,631
No, thanks. I'm okay.

497
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:44,907
How's my little sweetheart?

498
00:33:48,277 --> 00:33:51,168
We're just gonna go for a little walk,
so hold onto mum, okay?

499
00:34:15,439 --> 00:34:16,512
This is it!

500
00:34:24,585 --> 00:34:25,636
Ready?

501
00:35:41,051 --> 00:35:42,254
Do you want a blanket?

502
00:35:42,864 --> 00:35:44,182
Oh, thanks. I've got one.

503
00:35:45,494 --> 00:35:46,879
Well, you're warming for two.

504
00:35:47,274 --> 00:35:48,325
Take mine.

505
00:35:50,694 --> 00:35:51,738
Thank you.

506
00:36:00,474 --> 00:36:03,322
So... first plane crash?

507
00:36:04,749 --> 00:36:05,763
What gave it away?

508
00:36:06,363 --> 00:36:08,316
Ah, you can always spot the newbies.

509
00:36:13,544 --> 00:36:15,156
We're gonna be okay, you know.

510
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:18,262
Are we?

511
00:36:19,199 --> 00:36:20,199
We're alive.

512
00:36:20,988 --> 00:36:22,577
We're on a beautiful island.

513
00:36:23,712 --> 00:36:25,137
We'll sleep under the stars,

514
00:36:25,657 --> 00:36:28,532
and before you know it, the helicopters
will come and take us all home.

515
00:36:30,559 --> 00:36:32,046
You really think they'll find us?

516
00:36:33,432 --> 00:36:34,885
Well, yeah. Why wouldn't they?

517
00:36:37,903 --> 00:36:38,999
Thanks.

518
00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:42,535
I'm Charlie.

519
00:36:42,871 --> 00:36:43,960
I'm Claire.

520
00:36:44,597 --> 00:36:45,914
Nice to meet you, Charlie.

521
00:36:46,395 --> 00:36:47,587
It's nice to meet you.

522
00:37:09,291 --> 00:37:10,506
We're here.

523
00:37:21,445 --> 00:37:23,179
I want you to give this
to Claire for me.

524
00:37:29,884 --> 00:37:30,884
What is it?

525
00:37:36,131 --> 00:37:38,075
It's the five best moments of my...

526
00:37:39,896 --> 00:37:41,293
sorry excuse for a life.

527
00:37:44,803 --> 00:37:46,008
My greatest hits.

528
00:37:52,005 --> 00:37:53,005
You know...

529
00:37:56,633 --> 00:37:57,633
memories...

530
00:37:59,472 --> 00:38:00,568
are all I've got.

531
00:38:02,986 --> 00:38:04,168
You don't have to do this.

532
00:38:05,986 --> 00:38:06,996
What?

533
00:38:09,005 --> 00:38:10,005
I'll go.

534
00:38:11,202 --> 00:38:12,763
No, your... Your flashes...

535
00:38:12,975 --> 00:38:13,980
Maybe...

536
00:38:14,842 --> 00:38:16,861
I keep seeing you die because...

537
00:38:19,448 --> 00:38:21,106
I'm supposed to take your place.

538
00:38:26,986 --> 00:38:28,235
What about your girl...

539
00:38:29,087 --> 00:38:30,194
Penny?

540
00:38:32,421 --> 00:38:33,624
What about your girl?

541
00:38:38,337 --> 00:38:39,444
Besides...

542
00:38:43,828 --> 00:38:45,199
I might be luckier than you.

543
00:38:55,703 --> 00:38:57,190
Keep your memories to yourself.

544
00:39:01,246 --> 00:39:02,518
I'll take it from here.

545
00:39:10,621 --> 00:39:11,881
I don't know what to say.

546
00:39:15,484 --> 00:39:18,185
Well, you can tell me where the,
the weight belt is.

547
00:39:19,548 --> 00:39:20,808
Right there behind you.

548
00:39:47,142 --> 00:39:48,436
You and I both know...

549
00:39:49,718 --> 00:39:51,670
You aren't supposed
to take my place, brother.

550
00:41:56,463 --> 00:41:57,695
I'm alive.
