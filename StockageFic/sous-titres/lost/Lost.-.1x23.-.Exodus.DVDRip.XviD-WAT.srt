[grunts]

3
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:15,909
[Sayid] l found the wire on the beach.

4
00:00:15,982 --> 00:00:19,884
l thought it might have something to do
with a transmission we picked up,

5
00:00:19,953 --> 00:00:23,354
a Frenchwoman
repeating on a loop for 1 6 years.

6
00:00:23,423 --> 00:00:24,754
Has it really been that long?

7
00:00:24,824 --> 00:00:27,156
Have you seen other people
on this island?

8
00:00:27,227 --> 00:00:31,994
No. But l hear them.
They whisper.

9
00:00:32,065 --> 00:00:34,625
- We need to get off.
- Are you suggesting something?

10
00:00:34,701 --> 00:00:37,135
Yeah. We build a raft.

11
00:00:37,203 --> 00:00:40,570
- You're making a lot of progress.
- Yeah, trying.

12
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,369
Got this bamboo for the decking,

13
00:00:42,442 --> 00:00:45,309
a piece of the fuselage
for the cabin.

14
00:00:45,378 --> 00:00:46,970
lt'll work. We can do this.

15
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:48,776
lt's been raining every afternoon.

16
00:00:48,848 --> 00:00:51,817
That means that we are on
the cusp of monsoon season.

17
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:56,185
Why are we listening to Arzt? You're
a damn high school science teacher.

18
00:00:56,256 --> 00:00:58,156
l was assuming you
didn't want to die.

19
00:00:58,224 --> 00:01:01,125
- So when do we have to leave?
- Yesterday.

20
00:01:18,111 --> 00:01:20,545
<i>[TV blaring]</i>

21
00:01:20,613 --> 00:01:23,207
- [groans]
- <i>[TV] Yeah! All right!</i>

22
00:01:24,017 --> 00:01:26,815
- What're you doing?
- Watching TV.

23
00:01:26,886 --> 00:01:30,879
- <i>[TV] Yeah! Oh, yeah!</i>
- <i>Yeah! The power's amazing!</i>

24
00:01:30,957 --> 00:01:34,017
Oh, man, you see what time it is?
Go back to sleep, Walt.

25
00:01:34,094 --> 00:01:35,459
l always watch this show.

26
00:01:35,528 --> 00:01:37,894
Okay, then.

27
00:01:37,964 --> 00:01:39,795
Could you at least
turn it down?

28
00:01:41,134 --> 00:01:42,328
<i>[louder]</i>

29
00:01:44,637 --> 00:01:46,434
l said turn it down, Walt.

30
00:01:46,506 --> 00:01:49,907
- Brian lets me watch it as loud as...
- l'm not Brian.

31
00:01:50,977 --> 00:01:52,569
- Dang.
- Let's go, Vincent.

32
00:01:52,645 --> 00:01:54,476
Hey, where are you going? Hey!

33
00:01:54,547 --> 00:01:55,639
Walt!

34
00:01:55,715 --> 00:01:58,980
- Get away. Leave me alone.
- Don't even... Don't you think...

35
00:01:59,052 --> 00:02:01,452
- l said get away.
- Don't you walk away.

36
00:02:01,521 --> 00:02:03,614
l don't think so. Come on.

37
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:05,920
- Get off of me!
- l don't like this either.

38
00:02:05,992 --> 00:02:08,722
- But you're getting on that plane.
- What's going on?

39
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:11,787
- lt's okay. l'm his father.
- You're not my father!

40
00:02:11,865 --> 00:02:13,924
You're not my father!

41
00:03:42,255 --> 00:03:44,189
- Dad, wake up!
- What?

42
00:03:46,392 --> 00:03:47,916
Somebody's here.

43
00:03:50,496 --> 00:03:52,396
Hey! Hey! Stop!

44
00:03:53,499 --> 00:03:55,694
Slow, slow down.

45
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:00,896
- Who is that?
- Gotta be the French chick.

46
00:04:00,974 --> 00:04:03,238
Calm down, everyone.
lt's all right.

47
00:04:03,309 --> 00:04:04,571
Fine. Okay.

48
00:04:05,845 --> 00:04:08,473
[baby crying]

49
00:04:15,021 --> 00:04:17,387
[Sayid] Danielle?

50
00:04:18,858 --> 00:04:20,485
Danielle?

51
00:04:25,298 --> 00:04:26,959
What are you doing here?

52
00:04:29,669 --> 00:04:31,762
The others are coming.

53
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:52,253
Our ship went aground

54
00:04:52,325 --> 00:04:55,624
on this island 1 6 years ago.

55
00:04:55,695 --> 00:04:57,595
There were six of us.

56
00:04:57,664 --> 00:05:01,430
My team. Six.

57
00:05:01,501 --> 00:05:03,901
By that time,

58
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:06,234
l was already
seven months pregnant.

59
00:05:07,573 --> 00:05:10,098
l delivered the infant myself.

60
00:05:12,512 --> 00:05:15,709
The baby and l were together
for only one week,

61
00:05:15,782 --> 00:05:18,478
when l saw black smoke.

62
00:05:19,852 --> 00:05:23,948
A pillar of black smoke
five kilometers inland.

63
00:05:26,426 --> 00:05:30,089
That night, they came.

64
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:35,900
They came and took her.

65
00:05:37,236 --> 00:05:38,601
Alex.

66
00:05:40,206 --> 00:05:42,231
They took my baby.

67
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:48,046
And now they're coming again.

68
00:05:48,114 --> 00:05:50,810
They're coming for all of you.

69
00:05:50,883 --> 00:05:54,683
- Who's coming?
- The others.

70
00:05:54,754 --> 00:05:56,847
You have only three choices.

71
00:05:57,690 --> 00:05:59,954
Run.

72
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:01,618
Hide.

73
00:06:03,496 --> 00:06:04,963
Or die.

74
00:06:06,966 --> 00:06:08,991
[Jack] This woman
blew up her own shelter.

75
00:06:09,068 --> 00:06:11,832
Now she talks about black smoke
and hearing whispers.

76
00:06:11,904 --> 00:06:13,701
She's not playing with a full deck.

77
00:06:13,773 --> 00:06:16,241
That doesn't mean
what she's saying isn't true.

78
00:06:16,309 --> 00:06:18,106
You can focus on the ''what ifs.''

79
00:06:18,177 --> 00:06:22,307
l'm sticking with the tangible,
and that's the launching of the raft.

80
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:24,714
- How's it going?
- l wanted to get off today,

81
00:06:24,784 --> 00:06:28,379
but realistically, man,
after we get the rudder done,

82
00:06:28,454 --> 00:06:31,514
we still gotta lay the rails
to get her down to the water.

83
00:06:31,591 --> 00:06:35,391
[Jack] Wouldn't it save time to lay
the rails while you finish the rudder?

84
00:06:35,461 --> 00:06:37,395
Manpower shortage.

85
00:06:37,463 --> 00:06:40,125
What do you need?
To lay the rails and move the boat?

86
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:43,657
Get it all done today?
Pretty much everybody.

87
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:47,936
All right, give me 20 minutes.

88
00:06:50,376 --> 00:06:52,606
Grab as many palm tree logs
as you can find,

89
00:06:52,678 --> 00:06:54,942
the longer the better,
over to the raft area.

90
00:06:55,014 --> 00:06:57,244
- Michael knows what to do.
- See ya then.

91
00:06:57,316 --> 00:06:59,546
[Michael] You need to
get 'em in there tight,

92
00:06:59,619 --> 00:07:01,746
and leverage
to get 'em on the rails.

93
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:03,847
Yeah, that's good.

94
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:06,255
[Michael] Good. That's good.

95
00:07:08,461 --> 00:07:09,689
Okay, that's good, man.

96
00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:13,789
Just get it under there, okay?
Okay.

97
00:07:13,866 --> 00:07:15,891
- You all right?
- Yep.

98
00:07:15,968 --> 00:07:17,435
So listen, on my count,

99
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:21,269
l'll do, ''one, two, three, lift,''
and then push, okay?

100
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:24,673
Got it? Okay, come on.

101
00:07:24,744 --> 00:07:28,646
Once it's down to the water line,
we'll drop it and load it up.

102
00:07:28,714 --> 00:07:31,012
All right. Ready?

103
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:36,247
One.

104
00:07:38,858 --> 00:07:39,916
Two.

105
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:42,652
Three. Lift!

106
00:07:42,728 --> 00:07:45,754
- [all straining]
- [creaking]

107
00:07:50,837 --> 00:07:52,168
Push!

108
00:07:53,573 --> 00:07:56,565
Push! Come on, guys.

109
00:07:56,642 --> 00:07:58,940
Push. Push!

110
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:03,343
Use your levers.
Use the levers.

111
00:08:06,018 --> 00:08:08,953
Yeah. Good, good.

112
00:08:09,021 --> 00:08:12,548
One, two, three, lift.

113
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:14,616
Hey, keep it straight.

114
00:08:15,061 --> 00:08:17,256
[speaking Korean]

115
00:08:20,967 --> 00:08:24,903
[Michael] Oh, no! Come on!
l can't believe this.

116
00:08:24,971 --> 00:08:26,029
Can't believe it.

117
00:08:26,105 --> 00:08:29,097
- What are you looking at me for?
- You missed the lever!

118
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:32,906
- You couldn't keep the raft straight!
- l couldn't keep it straight?

119
00:08:32,979 --> 00:08:34,913
Dad! Look.

120
00:08:58,471 --> 00:09:02,134
- [Jack] How many of them are there?
- l told you all l know.

121
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:04,506
There has to be more to tell.
How did you know?

122
00:09:04,577 --> 00:09:06,374
[Danielle] You have a bigger problem.

123
00:09:06,445 --> 00:09:10,347
l can vanish into the jungle,
but l'm just one person.

124
00:09:10,416 --> 00:09:12,179
You have 40 people.

125
00:09:13,753 --> 00:09:15,550
Where will you hide them?

126
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:30,425
Dude. Whoa.

127
00:09:36,642 --> 00:09:38,269
What is this?

128
00:09:39,111 --> 00:09:40,703
We hoped you could tell us.

129
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:44,216
- l've never seen anything like it.
- [Hurley] Uh, question.

130
00:09:44,283 --> 00:09:47,616
How do you know we can
all, like, fit in there?

131
00:09:47,687 --> 00:09:51,748
No handle outside, must be another
way in. Another entrance means space.

132
00:09:51,824 --> 00:09:54,691
This is a mistake.
We don't know about these others.

133
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:59,527
We're reacting with no information,
no intelligence. This might be theirs.

134
00:10:00,066 --> 00:10:01,727
Black smoke doesn't mean...

135
00:10:01,801 --> 00:10:04,133
- lt means they're coming.
- Yeah, we got that.

136
00:10:04,203 --> 00:10:07,764
You booby-trapped your shelter
with explosives. Have any more?

137
00:10:09,809 --> 00:10:12,937
Dynamite. At the Black Rock.

138
00:10:14,146 --> 00:10:15,374
ln the Dark Territory.

139
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:18,542
That's three reasons
to go right there.

140
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:21,280
lf we're to make it back by sunset,

141
00:10:21,354 --> 00:10:23,413
we have to leave
within the hour.

142
00:10:34,667 --> 00:10:38,626
[plane engines whirring]

143
00:10:43,042 --> 00:10:46,569
Tequila and tonic
with a wedge of lemon.

144
00:10:53,252 --> 00:10:54,719
Why were you yelling?

145
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:00,982
The girl at the check-in counter.

146
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:03,290
You were yelling at her.

147
00:11:04,864 --> 00:11:09,028
l'm sorry, uh, do l know you?

148
00:11:09,101 --> 00:11:11,592
l'm on your flight. LA.

149
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:15,903
So, your dad died, huh?

150
00:11:19,478 --> 00:11:22,072
l thought you didn't hear
what l was yelling about.

151
00:11:22,148 --> 00:11:24,139
l was being polite.

152
00:11:26,419 --> 00:11:29,616
Yeah, my dad died.

153
00:11:30,556 --> 00:11:31,580
How?

154
00:11:33,426 --> 00:11:34,825
A heart attack.

155
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:40,161
Not a drinker, huh?

156
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:43,232
No, not really.

157
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:51,999
No ring 'cause you're single
or because you don't like wearing one?

158
00:11:54,013 --> 00:11:55,503
You asking me if l'm married?

159
00:11:56,449 --> 00:11:57,780
Are you married?

160
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:01,649
No, not anymore.

161
00:12:06,192 --> 00:12:09,355
Can we get another
tequila and tonic, please?

162
00:12:12,331 --> 00:12:14,322
l didn't think you were listening.

163
00:12:16,869 --> 00:12:19,929
- So, what's your name?
- Ana-Lucia.

164
00:12:20,005 --> 00:12:22,269
So, tell me, Ana-Lucia,

165
00:12:22,341 --> 00:12:24,468
why are you drinking
tequila and tonics

166
00:12:24,543 --> 00:12:29,105
- at ten to noon?
- l hate flying.

167
00:12:29,181 --> 00:12:32,412
And they stuck me all the way
in the back of the plane

168
00:12:32,485 --> 00:12:35,454
where the wheels come down
right under your damn feet.

169
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:38,287
So, where are you sitting?

170
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:42,925
23 B.

171
00:12:43,529 --> 00:12:46,555
42 F. Wanna trade?

172
00:12:46,632 --> 00:12:49,066
- [chuckles]
- <i>[ringing]</i>

173
00:12:51,971 --> 00:12:56,431
Hey. Yeah, l'm in Sydney.
Hold on.

174
00:12:57,977 --> 00:13:01,071
- Sorry...
- Uh, Jack.

175
00:13:01,147 --> 00:13:03,809
Jack. l gotta talk.

176
00:13:03,883 --> 00:13:07,478
Um... we'll have the next drink
on the plane, okay?

177
00:13:07,553 --> 00:13:11,319
- 42 F.
- 42 F. Right.

178
00:13:13,859 --> 00:13:15,759
And, Jack?

179
00:13:16,862 --> 00:13:18,853
The worst part's over.

180
00:13:26,238 --> 00:13:29,173
They stuck me all the way
in the back of the plane.

181
00:13:29,241 --> 00:13:31,641
Look, l know you're all scared.

182
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:33,974
And l know that everybody
has a lot of questions.

183
00:13:37,349 --> 00:13:39,874
All l can tell you right now
is that we do have a plan.

184
00:13:39,952 --> 00:13:42,147
We've got to go into
the jungle for supplies.

185
00:13:42,221 --> 00:13:44,314
We'll be back in a few hours.

186
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:46,381
ln the meantime,
do everything you can

187
00:13:46,458 --> 00:13:48,517
to help Michael get that raft
on the water.

188
00:13:48,594 --> 00:13:51,688
And after that, go to the caves.

189
00:13:51,764 --> 00:13:55,894
We'll be back
as soon as we can. l promise.

190
00:13:58,070 --> 00:13:59,765
Hey, nice speech.

191
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:02,273
Plan's a little flawed,
but nobody's perfect.

192
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:04,502
- My plan?
- Your plan. Go in the jungle,

193
00:14:04,577 --> 00:14:06,909
and get dynamite
and blow open a hatch,

194
00:14:07,046 --> 00:14:09,844
and then hide everyone inside.

195
00:14:09,915 --> 00:14:12,315
You wanna keep a secret,
don't tell the fat guy.

196
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:16,685
What do you want, Arzt?

197
00:14:16,755 --> 00:14:19,383
God knows how long
that dynamite has been out there.

198
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:21,426
And from what l can tell,
Madame Nutso

199
00:14:21,493 --> 00:14:24,326
doesn't seem too concerned
with how to handle it.

200
00:14:24,396 --> 00:14:28,890
So unless you want to blow up,
l'm coming with you.

201
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:33,595
Okay.
Grab some water bottles.

202
00:14:33,672 --> 00:14:35,401
We're leaving in a half an hour.

203
00:14:37,576 --> 00:14:40,443
We can salvage the cables, but we
need new bamboo for the mast.

204
00:14:40,512 --> 00:14:43,345
[speaking Korean]

205
00:14:43,415 --> 00:14:47,010
We need to fix the rudder
before we start to think about that.

206
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:50,888
- You need help?
- Let's get this done first.

207
00:14:50,956 --> 00:14:54,687
Hey, this wasn't my fault.
So put me to work.

208
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:57,228
No offense.
We just work faster this way, okay?

209
00:14:59,098 --> 00:15:02,033
All right! What do you think
l'm doing over here?

210
00:15:06,505 --> 00:15:08,234
[man] You remember me?

211
00:15:09,074 --> 00:15:10,371
Three nights ago.

212
00:15:10,442 --> 00:15:12,876
You were hauled in here
thrashing and fighting.

213
00:15:13,379 --> 00:15:15,870
As you were being escorted by,
you kicked my desk.

214
00:15:17,283 --> 00:15:19,376
And you broke my mug.

215
00:15:19,451 --> 00:15:21,009
Nice kids.

216
00:15:21,086 --> 00:15:22,519
Sadly for you,

217
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:25,580
breaking my mug was not the most
significant mistake you made.

218
00:15:25,658 --> 00:15:28,320
Come on, doctor.
l got into a bar fight.

219
00:15:28,394 --> 00:15:30,589
Ain't that a badge
of honor in this country?

220
00:15:30,663 --> 00:15:32,893
You know who you
head-butted in that bar?

221
00:15:32,965 --> 00:15:35,661
You head-butted
the Honorable Warren Truss...

222
00:15:37,303 --> 00:15:40,397
...Minister of Agriculture,
Fisheries and Forestry.

223
00:15:40,472 --> 00:15:42,872
- The most important...
- He head-butted me.

224
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:45,376
We have witnesses.
He did no such thing.

225
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:47,571
'Course.

226
00:15:48,347 --> 00:15:50,941
You think this is funny, James?

227
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:57,885
''James Ford.
Assault, wire fraud,

228
00:15:57,957 --> 00:16:00,892
identity theft, bank fraud,
telemarketing fraud...''

229
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:04,487
- This going someplace?
- You're a blight, a stain, scavenger.

230
00:16:04,563 --> 00:16:06,895
You're a con man preying
on the weak and needy.

231
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:09,958
Tell me something, James,
how do you live with yourself?

232
00:16:10,035 --> 00:16:12,663
- l do just fine.
- Do you?

233
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:18,132
You're not even worth
the cost to incarcerate you.

234
00:16:19,511 --> 00:16:23,003
Which is why you're being deported.

235
00:16:23,082 --> 00:16:26,574
Your plane leaves this afternoon.
And, James,

236
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:29,519
you're banned from ever
setting foot in Australia again.

237
00:16:29,588 --> 00:16:33,285
Don't you worry.
l ain't ever coming back here.

238
00:16:33,359 --> 00:16:35,088
Best not, mate.

239
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:39,320
[chopping]

240
00:16:52,711 --> 00:16:54,144
[Jack] A lumberjack.

241
00:16:56,181 --> 00:16:57,341
'Scuse me?

242
00:16:57,416 --> 00:17:00,476
l never asked what you did
back in the real world.

243
00:17:00,552 --> 00:17:03,817
So l'm taking a wild guess.
Lumberjack.

244
00:17:03,889 --> 00:17:06,881
Something l can help you with, doc?
'Cause l got work to do.

245
00:17:08,527 --> 00:17:10,154
l got something for you.

246
00:17:12,765 --> 00:17:15,757
You're the only one on the raft
who knows how to use one.

247
00:17:15,834 --> 00:17:18,530
- What do l need a gun for?
- Just in case.

248
00:17:20,105 --> 00:17:22,630
You think we're gonna
run outta food and water?

249
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:24,573
l put the kid out of his misery?

250
00:17:24,643 --> 00:17:26,042
Just in case.

251
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:30,177
What're you doing with the rest?

252
00:17:30,249 --> 00:17:32,114
Giving 'em to Sayid.

253
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:35,979
Going into the jungle
after the boomsticks, huh?

254
00:17:37,256 --> 00:17:38,518
Yeah.

255
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:40,820
Time you get back,
we'll be in the water.

256
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:43,760
Guess this is pretty much
goodbye then.

257
00:17:45,197 --> 00:17:46,858
Yeah, l guess it is.

258
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:51,666
Good luck, Sawyer.

259
00:17:57,976 --> 00:17:58,965
Jack.

260
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:08,852
About a week before
we all got on the plane,

261
00:18:10,355 --> 00:18:13,222
l got to talking to this man
in a bar in Sydney.

262
00:18:13,292 --> 00:18:17,023
He was an American too.
A doctor.

263
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:19,962
l've been on some benders
in my time,

264
00:18:20,032 --> 00:18:23,798
but this guy was going
for an all-time record.

265
00:18:25,704 --> 00:18:27,899
So it turns out
this guy has a son.

266
00:18:28,907 --> 00:18:30,306
Son's a doctor too.

267
00:18:31,577 --> 00:18:34,774
They'd had some kinda
big-time falling out.

268
00:18:36,915 --> 00:18:39,645
The guy knew it was his fault...
even though his son

269
00:18:39,718 --> 00:18:42,346
was back in the States
thinking the same damn thing.

270
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:49,458
See, kids are like dogs.

271
00:18:50,262 --> 00:18:52,924
You knock 'em around enough,

272
00:18:52,998 --> 00:18:55,762
they'll think they did
something to deserve it.

273
00:18:59,938 --> 00:19:01,667
Anyway...

274
00:19:03,008 --> 00:19:05,476
...there's a pay phone in this bar,

275
00:19:05,544 --> 00:19:07,205
and this guy...

276
00:19:09,882 --> 00:19:11,213
...Christian...

277
00:19:13,185 --> 00:19:15,153
...tells me he wishes
he had the stones

278
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:17,688
to pick up the phone
and call his kid.

279
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:21,651
Tell him he's sorry.

280
00:19:22,961 --> 00:19:25,555
That he's a better doctor
than he'll ever be.

281
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:30,099
He's proud.

282
00:19:33,105 --> 00:19:34,572
And he loves him.

283
00:19:42,714 --> 00:19:44,238
l had to take off...

284
00:19:48,654 --> 00:19:51,817
...but something tells me
he never made that call.

285
00:19:57,396 --> 00:19:58,727
Small world, huh?

286
00:20:02,334 --> 00:20:03,392
Yeah.

287
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:08,833
Good luck, Jack.

288
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:32,296
- [man #1] You're gonna be armed?
- [man #2] Yes, sir, an ankle holster.

289
00:20:32,364 --> 00:20:34,992
Stow this in the crew luggage
compartment in front.

290
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:36,398
No problemo.

291
00:20:38,503 --> 00:20:40,164
Why do you need five guns?

292
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,569
Gee, you wanna tell him, Kate?

293
00:20:43,642 --> 00:20:46,304
Why do l need five guns?

294
00:20:48,814 --> 00:20:50,145
She's shy.

295
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:54,579
What's this, then?

296
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,984
That's a good story.
You wanna tell it?

297
00:20:57,055 --> 00:20:58,920
Huh, Kate?

298
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:04,794
This belonged to her
childhood sweetheart,

299
00:21:04,863 --> 00:21:08,060
who she got killed
a couple of years ago

300
00:21:08,133 --> 00:21:09,361
when she was on the run.

301
00:21:09,434 --> 00:21:12,995
Poor guy. Had a wife.
Two-year-old kid.

302
00:21:13,071 --> 00:21:15,096
What was his name?

303
00:21:17,809 --> 00:21:20,573
Somewhere during the three years
l was chasing her,

304
00:21:20,646 --> 00:21:24,275
she starts calling me
at my house,

305
00:21:24,349 --> 00:21:27,546
and whining on about
her mitigating circumstances.

306
00:21:27,619 --> 00:21:31,953
But what she's really doing...
is taunting me.

307
00:21:32,891 --> 00:21:35,018
So l tell her that l've got

308
00:21:35,093 --> 00:21:38,824
what's-his-name's
little toy airplane

309
00:21:38,897 --> 00:21:42,765
in a safe deposit box
in New Mexico.

310
00:21:42,834 --> 00:21:45,359
So she somehow
figures out which bank,

311
00:21:45,437 --> 00:21:47,166
which safe deposit box.

312
00:21:47,239 --> 00:21:50,970
She seduces some idiot
to rob the damn bank,

313
00:21:51,043 --> 00:21:54,706
then puts a bullet in her new friend
because she's done using him.

314
00:21:57,482 --> 00:22:01,509
But she leaves all the money.
She just takes the plane.

315
00:22:03,388 --> 00:22:06,050
Because that's the one thing
in the whole world

316
00:22:06,124 --> 00:22:08,649
that Kate does care about.

317
00:22:09,928 --> 00:22:11,520
She has no attachments.

318
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:17,496
And l think she's
telling herself she needs it

319
00:22:17,569 --> 00:22:21,733
to atone for killing her boyfriend,
what's-his-name.

320
00:22:24,142 --> 00:22:25,973
Come on.
What was his name?

321
00:22:26,044 --> 00:22:27,033
- Tom!
- [grunts]

322
00:22:27,112 --> 00:22:28,636
lt was Tom, you son of a bitch!

323
00:22:28,714 --> 00:22:31,080
- [grunts]
- [groaning]

324
00:22:33,285 --> 00:22:36,379
And that is why l need five guns.

325
00:22:54,373 --> 00:22:56,000
You're heading out?

326
00:22:58,610 --> 00:22:59,599
Yeah.

327
00:23:01,747 --> 00:23:03,840
l was thinking
that l might go with you...

328
00:23:05,117 --> 00:23:07,347
...for old time's sake.

329
00:23:09,788 --> 00:23:11,255
l wanna help.

330
00:23:13,725 --> 00:23:16,023
You won't be here
for the raft launching.

331
00:23:16,094 --> 00:23:20,428
Yeah, well, l'm not
very good at goodbyes.

332
00:23:22,534 --> 00:23:24,331
Grab your stuff.

333
00:23:33,779 --> 00:23:36,213
- Thanks, man.
- Keep it safe.

334
00:23:36,281 --> 00:23:39,580
Locke, you have a message?
lt's going on the raft.

335
00:23:39,651 --> 00:23:42,814
You know, ''Dear Mom,
everything's fine. l'm on the island.

336
00:23:42,888 --> 00:23:46,551
Unless the Black Smoke People
turn up. Love...'' Your name here.

337
00:23:46,625 --> 00:23:49,321
When they get rescued,
they can contact your family.

338
00:23:49,394 --> 00:23:52,363
Message in a bottle.
That's sweet.

339
00:23:55,033 --> 00:23:56,694
- You're ready?
- Here you go.

340
00:23:56,768 --> 00:23:58,099
Okay.

341
00:23:59,905 --> 00:24:01,566
- Don't look at it.
- Got it.

342
00:24:03,442 --> 00:24:05,376
Dude.

343
00:24:05,444 --> 00:24:07,571
Do not look at it.

344
00:24:08,847 --> 00:24:12,180
- Arzt! You want paper?
- l gave at the office.

345
00:24:16,054 --> 00:24:18,921
- Take care.
- Good luck, dude.

346
00:24:18,990 --> 00:24:21,117
- Keep dry, kiddo.
- [Walt] l will.

347
00:24:21,193 --> 00:24:23,525

351
00:24:35,474 --> 00:24:36,463
All right.

352
00:24:37,976 --> 00:24:39,307
Jin.

353
00:24:41,079 --> 00:24:42,478
Good luck.

[speaks Korean]

355
00:24:56,261 --> 00:25:00,357
- Hey, have you seen Sawyer?
- No.

356
00:25:01,099 --> 00:25:03,226
All right, let's go!

357
00:25:04,636 --> 00:25:06,160
Take care, okay?

358
00:26:02,294 --> 00:26:04,023
Where'd you get the scratches?

359
00:26:05,764 --> 00:26:06,822
A bush.

360
00:26:08,567 --> 00:26:09,693
Mean bush.

361
00:26:11,169 --> 00:26:13,569
We'd better keep moving.

362
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:25,479
- Let me ask you something, Arnzt.
- Arzt.

363
00:26:25,550 --> 00:26:29,509
- Arnzt.
- Not Arnzt. Arzt. A-R-Z-T.

364
00:26:29,588 --> 00:26:32,580
Sorry, man,
name's hard to pronounce.

365
00:26:32,657 --> 00:26:35,649
l know a bunch of ninth graders
who pronounce it just fine.

366
00:26:35,727 --> 00:26:37,854
How about l call you
by your first name?

367
00:26:37,929 --> 00:26:39,863
- How about you don't.
- Why not?

368
00:26:39,931 --> 00:26:42,195
l remember it
from the plane's manifest.

369
00:26:42,267 --> 00:26:45,532
- Leslie's a bitching name.
- ''Arnzt'' is fine.

370
00:27:24,109 --> 00:27:25,667
<i>Le Territoire fonce.</i>

371
00:27:27,245 --> 00:27:28,769
The Dark Territory.

372
00:27:32,717 --> 00:27:34,981
The Black Rock is not far.

373
00:27:35,053 --> 00:27:38,454
This is where it all began,
when my team got infected,

374
00:27:38,523 --> 00:27:39,956
when Montand lost his arm.

375
00:27:43,194 --> 00:27:44,661
We must move quickly.

376
00:27:44,729 --> 00:27:46,390
[thunder rumbling]

377
00:27:46,464 --> 00:27:49,729
You know what?
l'm going back.

378
00:27:49,801 --> 00:27:52,292
Hey, l thought
you wanted to help.

379
00:27:52,370 --> 00:27:53,598
Yeah, l wanted to help,

380
00:27:53,672 --> 00:27:56,106
before Montand
lost his frigging arm.

381
00:27:56,174 --> 00:27:58,199
What about the dynamite?

382
00:27:58,877 --> 00:28:02,142
Just be very careful with it.

383
00:28:11,056 --> 00:28:14,025
No! This one goes there,
that one goes there.

384
00:28:14,092 --> 00:28:15,821
Okay, okay.

385
00:28:15,894 --> 00:28:17,418
Hey, chief!

386
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:22,056
Cut and measured to length.

387
00:28:23,101 --> 00:28:26,195
- Perfect mast.
- Thanks.

388
00:28:28,173 --> 00:28:29,299
Well, all right.

389
00:28:30,975 --> 00:28:34,672
Are we gonna get off this rock
or just stand around talking about it?

390
00:28:53,798 --> 00:28:56,892
[man yelling]

391
00:29:00,939 --> 00:29:02,531

392
00:29:18,490 --> 00:29:20,754

Run!

395
00:29:30,969 --> 00:29:32,698

- Just be still.

396

[Locke] Wait.

[pounding footsteps grow faint]

402
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:04,792
lt's headed the other way.

403
00:30:18,616 --> 00:30:20,277
We're safe now.

404
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:25,119
- What was that thing?
- lt's a security system.

405
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:28,455
Security system?
What does that mean?

406
00:30:28,526 --> 00:30:31,393
lts purpose is that
of any security system's<i>:</i>

407
00:30:31,462 --> 00:30:33,259
To protect something.

408

Protect what?

409
00:30:36,467 --> 00:30:37,934
The island.

410
00:30:49,581 --> 00:30:51,981
[Hurley] Uh, where's Arnzt?

411
00:30:52,050 --> 00:30:54,780
That's Arzt, you idiot.

412
00:30:54,853 --> 00:30:57,378
Dude, l thought you were dead.

413
00:30:57,455 --> 00:31:00,720
Can we just please go
get the dynamite? Please?

414
00:31:13,271 --> 00:31:15,466
Why are you folding clothes?

415
00:31:16,507 --> 00:31:18,065
Because l'm anal.

416
00:31:23,147 --> 00:31:25,012
ls there something you want?

417
00:31:26,951 --> 00:31:28,782
l think you should take Vincent.

418
00:31:33,491 --> 00:31:34,549
Are you serious?

419
00:31:35,627 --> 00:31:37,094
He'll take care of you.

420
00:31:44,502 --> 00:31:47,198
What makes you think l need
a dog to take care of me?

421
00:31:48,306 --> 00:31:50,866
Vincent took care of me
when my mom died.

422
00:31:53,177 --> 00:31:56,044
And nobody would talk to me.

423
00:31:56,114 --> 00:31:59,174
They pretended
like nothing happened.

424
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:02,151
So l talked to Vincent.

425
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:03,380
He's a good listener.

426
00:32:05,290 --> 00:32:08,384
You could talk to him
about Boone if you want.

427
00:32:18,303 --> 00:32:19,895
All right.

428
00:32:22,674 --> 00:32:25,108
But only until
you get us rescued, okay?

429
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:42,954

- Sure. Whatever.
- Thank you.

Couldn't get us into first class.

Why not?

436
00:33:02,046 --> 00:33:04,776
Um, maybe you shouldn't have
yelled at the gate agent.

437
00:33:04,849 --> 00:33:07,079
What, you're on his side now?

438

One day you'll appreciate

Yeah, l can't wait for that day.

440

- Try again with the gate agent.
- Would you let it go?

Excuse me for not being
pathetic enough

- Oh, you wanna play?

- l'll get you thrown off this flight.
- How you gonna do that?

445
00:33:29,207 --> 00:33:31,141
l can do what l want.
l can tell them...

Who's gonna believe you?

- Yes, ma'am.

Some Arab guy left his bags in the
chairs downstairs and walked away.

- Can you describe him, please?
- Um... Arab.

451
00:33:50,261 --> 00:33:52,024
He went towards the shops.

452
00:33:52,096 --> 00:33:54,656
We've got a report
of suspicious activity...

00:33:56,701 --> 00:33:58,032
How's that?

454
00:34:03,374 --> 00:34:06,639
[Sayid] l salvaged a few things for you
from the Beechcraft.

455
00:34:06,711 --> 00:34:08,906
This is the plane's radar emitter.

456
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:11,847
lt needs to be mounted
on the mast or the top of the cabin.

457

l'll do it.

458

Michael, to conserve power,
turn it on only once every hour or so.

459

lt will show you any ships
within the horizon line,

00:34:21,192 --> 00:34:23,422
approximately 25 miles.

461
00:34:23,494 --> 00:34:25,826
The same with the radio transmitter.

462
00:34:25,897 --> 00:34:29,333
This was in the plane's toolbox.
There's only one flare.

463
