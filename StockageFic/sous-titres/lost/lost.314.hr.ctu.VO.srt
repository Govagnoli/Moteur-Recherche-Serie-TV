1
00:00:30,784 --> 00:00:33,766
And now dancing on stage three,

2
00:00:33,977 --> 00:00:36,126
the pride of St. Paul...

3
00:00:36,246 --> 00:00:37,585
Corvette!

4
00:01:20,948 --> 00:01:22,907
That's the money for the orphanage!

5
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:25,959
That means, Mr. Lashade,
you're the Cobra.

6
00:01:26,906 --> 00:01:28,990
Sorry, baby, it's just business.

7
00:01:29,598 --> 00:01:30,986
All this time it was you!

8
00:01:31,347 --> 00:01:34,068
Pretty and smart, what a shame.

9
00:01:36,521 --> 00:01:37,658
Razzle dazzle!

10
00:01:50,673 --> 00:01:53,317
Autumn, Crystal, bad news.

11
00:01:53,605 --> 00:01:55,600
Corvette was working for the Cobra.

12
00:01:57,603 --> 00:01:58,720
But fear not...

13
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:00,974
He will pay.

14
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,283
And... Cut!

15
00:02:04,983 --> 00:02:06,983
- Check the gate!
- Checking.

16
00:02:07,138 --> 00:02:08,300
Here, let me give you a hand.

17
00:02:08,339 --> 00:02:12,102
Thank you. Billy Dee,
it was so great working with you.

18
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:14,163
No, the pleasure's all mine.
Thank you so much.

19
00:02:14,187 --> 00:02:15,361
- You're sweet.
- Take care.

20
00:02:15,396 --> 00:02:16,470
You, too.

21
00:02:17,097 --> 00:02:19,860
All right.
That's a series wrap for Corvette!

22
00:02:20,531 --> 00:02:21,864
Let's hear it for Nikki!

23
00:02:21,972 --> 00:02:23,091
Well done!

24
00:02:24,262 --> 00:02:25,920
Thank you. Thanks.

25
00:02:26,367 --> 00:02:28,282
Brilliant, Nikki, as always.

26
00:02:29,185 --> 00:02:30,902
You know, you don't need to die.

27
00:02:31,087 --> 00:02:33,131
We can bring you back next season.

28
00:02:33,268 --> 00:02:34,290
How?

29
00:02:34,367 --> 00:02:35,922
Well, we could say that...

30
00:02:35,932 --> 00:02:38,043
Corvette was wearing a bulletproof vest.

31
00:02:41,306 --> 00:02:42,392
Bulletproof breast.

32
00:02:43,805 --> 00:02:45,240
Look, I'm just a guest star,

33
00:02:45,241 --> 00:02:47,574
and we all know what happens
to guest stars.

34
00:02:47,782 --> 00:02:49,588
Now that your work's done here,

35
00:02:49,804 --> 00:02:53,036
I suppose you'll be leaving Sydney
and heading back to L.A.

36
00:02:53,112 --> 00:02:55,002
No, I'm not leaving Sydney.

37
00:02:55,785 --> 00:02:56,785
I love you.

38
00:02:57,724 --> 00:02:58,835
And I love you, too.

39
00:03:08,973 --> 00:03:10,187
Son of a bitch.

40
00:03:10,841 --> 00:03:12,423
All right. Come on. Let's go one more.

41
00:03:12,467 --> 00:03:13,721
You said best out of five.

42
00:03:13,788 --> 00:03:15,405
Well, now we're goin' best of seven.

43
00:03:24,765 --> 00:03:25,826
You okay?

44
00:03:32,052 --> 00:03:33,055
What happened?

45
00:03:33,075 --> 00:03:34,141
Pa... l... s...

46
00:03:35,727 --> 00:03:37,515
- What the hell did she say?
- I don't know.

47
00:03:37,516 --> 00:03:39,453
Let's get her some water. Get help.

48
00:03:51,141 --> 00:03:52,571
What are you doin'? Get movin'!

49
00:03:54,575 --> 00:03:55,575
Dude...

50
00:03:57,765 --> 00:03:58,765
Nikki's dead.

51
00:04:02,451 --> 00:04:03,617
Who the hell's Nikki?

52
00:04:06,828 --> 00:04:09,913
Subtitles : www.swsub.com

53
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:18,413
Howie, the frittada is amazing.

54
00:04:19,461 --> 00:04:20,487
It's my new chef.

55
00:04:20,622 --> 00:04:21,819
He's fantastic.

56
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:23,734
Paulo, come in here.

57
00:04:24,802 --> 00:04:28,120
- Yes, sir?
- Paulo, my boy, you have a new fan.

58
00:04:28,554 --> 00:04:29,928
I'd like you to meet Nikki.

59
00:04:29,929 --> 00:04:31,040
The food is amazing.

60
00:04:31,927 --> 00:04:32,927
You're too kind.

61
00:04:33,879 --> 00:04:36,117
The secret is the shaved truffles.

62
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:38,867
Luckily for you, they are in season.

63
00:04:38,991 --> 00:04:41,233
You know, you should ask for a raise.

64
00:04:45,052 --> 00:04:46,052
Excuse me.

65
00:04:46,865 --> 00:04:48,142
He just came to Sydney.

66
00:04:48,615 --> 00:04:51,241
Heard I was hiring
and showed up at my office every day

67
00:04:51,242 --> 00:04:52,630
until I gave him the job.

68
00:04:53,991 --> 00:04:56,787
Apparently, back home, he's the...

69
00:04:57,365 --> 00:04:59,073
Wolfgang Puck of Brazil.

70
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:03,510
Here.

71
00:05:03,657 --> 00:05:05,956
Try one of his homemade rolls.

72
00:05:06,218 --> 00:05:07,277
Please, please do.

73
00:05:14,501 --> 00:05:15,526
It's...

74
00:05:15,799 --> 00:05:16,811
Beautiful.

75
00:05:17,406 --> 00:05:19,139
Howie, you shouldn't have.

76
00:05:20,512 --> 00:05:22,517
I realize, of course, it's not a ring.

77
00:05:22,574 --> 00:05:25,411
Not yet, but, when my wife...

78
00:05:46,327 --> 00:05:47,327
He's gone.

79
00:06:03,612 --> 00:06:05,864
I would have loved it
if you could've figured out a way

80
00:06:05,922 --> 00:06:08,261
where I didn't have to eat
the same food as him.

81
00:06:10,864 --> 00:06:12,736
So nobody else knows about this thing?

82
00:06:13,122 --> 00:06:15,398
Everything in here is way off the books.

83
00:06:21,523 --> 00:06:23,702
- What?
- Ashes are evidence, Paulo.

84
00:06:23,896 --> 00:06:26,209
We poisoned him.
Let's not poison ourselves.

85
00:06:41,898 --> 00:06:44,079
Razzle frickin' dazzle.

86
00:06:46,947 --> 00:06:48,008
What happened?

87
00:06:48,208 --> 00:06:49,208
We don't know.

88
00:06:49,457 --> 00:06:51,269
She's got no gunshot wound,
no knife wound,

89
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:53,233
no polar bear bite, nothing.

90
00:06:53,521 --> 00:06:55,243
Maybe it was something she ate.

91
00:06:55,332 --> 00:06:56,490
Maybe she was poisoned.

92
00:06:56,582 --> 00:06:59,405
We should check the food supply
to see if anyone else is sick.

93
00:06:59,861 --> 00:07:02,258
She's got gunk under her fingernails.

94
00:07:04,178 --> 00:07:05,239
Where'd you find her?

95
00:07:05,296 --> 00:07:07,881
Right here.
She stumbled out of the jungle,

96
00:07:08,107 --> 00:07:10,607
face planted.
She said something like "plywood"

97
00:07:11,297 --> 00:07:13,109
and... sayonara.

98
00:07:13,513 --> 00:07:15,887
Actually,
I think she said "power lines."

99
00:07:16,315 --> 00:07:18,909
Who the hell knows what she said?
She was 5 seconds from dying.

100
00:07:18,948 --> 00:07:21,358
She was probably seein' the light
at the end of the tunnel.

101
00:07:21,359 --> 00:07:23,203
"Paulo lies!" That's what she said.

102
00:07:23,234 --> 00:07:25,517
"Paulo lies," not "power lines."
Paulo lies.

103
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:26,837
Who the hell's Paulo?

104
00:07:26,921 --> 00:07:28,105
Paulo's her...

105
00:07:28,344 --> 00:07:30,537
husband or boyfriend

106
00:07:30,934 --> 00:07:32,585
Whatever. They lived down the beach.

107
00:07:32,643 --> 00:07:34,129
Well, where the hell is he?

108
00:07:34,409 --> 00:07:37,245
'cause if he lies,
that might be a good place to start.

109
00:07:40,985 --> 00:07:43,162
"English expat, Howard L. Zuckerman,

110
00:07:43,297 --> 00:07:46,746

113
00:07:53,670 --> 00:07:54,941
"from heart failure."

114
00:08:02,998 --> 00:08:04,229
Are you chewing gum?

115
00:08:09,618 --> 00:08:10,618
Nicotine gum.

116
00:08:11,805 --> 00:08:12,805
I quit.

117
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:18,557
A toast...

118
00:08:18,806 --> 00:08:20,194
To our new life together.

119
00:08:20,555 --> 00:08:21,555
Cheers.

120
00:08:22,437 --> 00:08:23,771
There's nowhere to sit.

121
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:27,307
No tables, no chairs, nothing.

122
00:08:27,772 --> 00:08:28,870
Good call, Boone.

123
00:08:29,469 --> 00:08:31,418
You want me to grab a chair
from the restaurant?

124
00:08:31,437 --> 00:08:32,932
Forget it. Let's just leave!

125
00:08:32,944 --> 00:08:34,992
You already screwed us
out of seats in first class.

126
00:08:34,993 --> 00:08:36,830
Why would you be able to find them here?

127
00:08:36,869 --> 00:08:38,817
Hey, can I have this chair, please?

128
00:08:38,934 --> 00:08:40,669
Yeah. Be my guest.

129
00:08:40,806 --> 00:08:42,219
Boone, let's just go!

130
00:08:43,744 --> 00:08:44,744
Thanks anyway.

131
00:08:46,382 --> 00:08:47,493
I'm coming, Shannon.

132
00:08:47,695 --> 00:08:49,398
If you quit flirting with random guys,

133
00:08:49,456 --> 00:08:51,357
maybe we could actually
get on the plane.

134
00:08:51,989 --> 00:08:54,188
Promise me we'll never end up like them.

135
00:08:59,832 --> 00:09:00,931
I promise.

136
00:09:24,279 --> 00:09:26,129
Please help!

137
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:49,956
Get away from there!

138
00:09:50,715 --> 00:09:52,048
Hey! Get back! Get down!

139
00:09:52,533 --> 00:09:53,644
Get away from there!

140
00:10:15,099 --> 00:10:16,238
Are we alive?

141
00:10:16,357 --> 00:10:17,357
Did we survive?

142
00:10:17,982 --> 00:10:20,205
Look at me. Am I okay? Am I okay?

143
00:10:21,758 --> 00:10:23,291
Do you have a pen?

144
00:10:23,619 --> 00:10:24,670
Pen?

145
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:26,237
Does anybody have a pen?

146
00:10:40,145 --> 00:10:41,531
Are you okay?

147
00:10:41,701 --> 00:10:44,576
Yeah, I think so.

148
00:10:44,821 --> 00:10:46,311
Baby, look at me. Look at me.

149
00:10:48,490 --> 00:10:49,607
Where's the bag?

150
00:10:51,296 --> 00:10:52,871
- What?
- The bag.

151
00:10:52,981 --> 00:10:54,125
Paulo, where is it?

152
00:11:00,294 --> 00:11:02,050
I'm telling you, this is the trail.

153
00:11:02,109 --> 00:11:03,584
What do you know about tracking?

154
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:05,757
- Well, I know what a footprint is.
- Over here.

155
00:11:12,551 --> 00:11:14,122
I'm guessin' that's Paulo.

156
00:11:22,753 --> 00:11:24,619
He's just like Nikki. No wound, nothing.

157
00:11:27,072 --> 00:11:28,072
Yeah, I know.

158
00:11:28,885 --> 00:11:30,273
Why are his pants undone?

159
00:11:31,572 --> 00:11:34,929
- And why is his shoe in that tree?
- Maybe he stepped on something.

160
00:11:41,187 --> 00:11:42,187
You see something?

161
00:11:44,829 --> 00:11:45,829
Nothing.

162
00:11:50,291 --> 00:11:51,294
Don't.

163
00:11:55,576 --> 00:11:56,967
Dude,
what are you doing?

164
00:11:57,135 --> 00:11:58,138
Two people are dead.

165
00:11:58,157 --> 00:11:59,982
You ever think
they might have been poisoned.

166
00:12:00,001 --> 00:12:02,788
That's evidence.
You're messing up the crime scene.

167
00:12:02,953 --> 00:12:03,953
Crime scene?

168
00:12:04,511 --> 00:12:06,975
Is there a forensics hatch
I don't know about?

169
00:12:09,189 --> 00:12:10,081
Monster.

170
00:12:14,763 --> 00:12:17,098
How many times do I have to tell you,

171
00:12:17,155 --> 00:12:18,950
there's no such thing as monsters?

172
00:12:19,602 --> 00:12:20,983
Maybe it was a dinosaur.

173
00:12:21,713 --> 00:12:24,427
It's not "Jurassic Park," Paulo.
It's the South Pacific.

174
00:12:24,802 --> 00:12:27,012
Then what was it?
You saw the trees move.

175
00:12:27,964 --> 00:12:31,607
Would you start focusing?
We've been here for six days, okay?

176
00:12:31,664 --> 00:12:33,588
The coast guard
is gonna get here any second,

177
00:12:33,654 --> 00:12:35,632
and I really don't think
that they're gonna take,

178
00:12:35,651 --> 00:12:37,708
"hey, you know what?
I'm looking for my script bag"

179
00:12:37,766 --> 00:12:39,698
as an excuse
for not getting on the rescue boat.

180
00:12:41,757 --> 00:12:43,108
Did you guys lose your luggage?

181
00:12:44,113 --> 00:12:47,220
I lost mine, too.
I found some other stuff, though,

182
00:12:47,863 --> 00:12:50,474
so if you need anything,
pants or sweatshirt...

183
00:12:51,489 --> 00:12:53,377
I can help you find some that fit.

184
00:12:55,925 --> 00:12:57,327
I'm Ethan, by the way.

185
00:12:57,778 --> 00:12:59,185
Hi. I'm Nikki...

186
00:12:59,312 --> 00:13:00,836
and this is Paulo.

187
00:13:02,024 --> 00:13:04,184
And you are so sweet, Ethan, but

188
00:13:04,588 --> 00:13:06,756
actually, we're not looking for clothes.

189
00:13:07,476 --> 00:13:09,346
Paulo here lost his nicotine gum.

190
00:13:10,426 --> 00:13:12,036
You might have more luck
looking inland.

191
00:13:12,585 --> 00:13:13,589
In the jungle?

192
00:13:13,590 --> 00:13:15,651
The plane split apart
when it was over the island,

193
00:13:15,652 --> 00:13:18,268
so some of the stuff might have
rained down in there.

194
00:13:20,114 --> 00:13:21,180
Boone took the water!

195
00:13:22,973 --> 00:13:24,165
What is going on?

196
00:13:24,278 --> 00:13:27,294
Someone had to take responsibility.
It would have never lasted.

197
00:13:27,719 --> 00:13:28,971
Leave him alone!

198
00:13:33,346 --> 00:13:34,690
It's been six days,

199
00:13:35,811 --> 00:13:37,972
and we're all still waiting
for someone to come.

200
00:13:40,032 --> 00:13:41,365
We have to stop waiting.

201
00:13:44,033 --> 00:13:46,088
We need to start figuring things out.

202
00:13:47,281 --> 00:13:48,506
Now I found water,

203
00:13:48,883 --> 00:13:50,408
fresh water up in the valley.

204
00:13:51,719 --> 00:13:53,607
I'm taking a group at first light.

205
00:13:54,346 --> 00:13:57,834
If y don't want to come,
then find another way to contribute,

206
00:13:59,193 --> 00:14:01,980
because every man for himself
is not gonna work.

207
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,553
But if we can't live together...

208
00:14:10,282 --> 00:14:11,504
we're gonna die alone.

209
00:14:16,657 --> 00:14:17,657
I'm with Jin.

210
00:14:18,157 --> 00:14:19,157
It's the monster.

211
00:14:19,532 --> 00:14:21,369
Yeah, because that makes
the most sense.

212
00:14:21,390 --> 00:14:22,405
It does.

213
00:14:22,406 --> 00:14:24,781
Locke said when Eko died,
his last words were,

214
00:14:24,782 --> 00:14:27,718
"you're next,"
and Nikki and Paulo were with them.

215
00:14:29,094 --> 00:14:30,398
He was talking about them.

216
00:14:30,469 --> 00:14:32,977
He wasn't saying
"you're next" about them.

217
00:14:33,532 --> 00:14:36,833
He was saying "you're next"
as in you're all next.

218
00:14:37,069 --> 00:14:38,817
Yeah, that's not really better.

219
00:14:39,221 --> 00:14:41,438
All right, so here's how I see it.

220
00:14:42,346 --> 00:14:43,798
We wanna know what happened?

221
00:14:43,905 --> 00:14:46,640
We gotta find out whatever we can
about these jabonies.

222
00:14:46,907 --> 00:14:47,907
Ja-bo-nies?

223
00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:49,030
Nina and Pablo.

224
00:14:49,219 --> 00:14:50,560
Dude, show some respect.

225
00:14:51,597 --> 00:14:53,337
You know their names.
It Nikki and Paulo.

226
00:14:53,656 --> 00:14:54,656
Whatever, Hugo.

227
00:14:55,158 --> 00:14:56,213
Where's their tent?

228
00:14:57,599 --> 00:14:59,316
And we better get some shovels.

229
00:15:08,939 --> 00:15:09,939
Hey, Dr. Arzt.

230
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:12,250
Oh, hi.

231
00:15:12,592 --> 00:15:14,319
You're a scientist, right?

232
00:15:15,251 --> 00:15:17,010
And an educator, yes.

233
00:15:18,361 --> 00:15:20,040
What are you doing
with all this stuff?

234
00:15:20,522 --> 00:15:22,814
Well, since we got here,
I've discovered 20 new species.

235
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:24,633
I'm gonna be the next Charles Darwin.

236
00:15:26,889 --> 00:15:29,236
That is, latrodectus regina.

237
00:15:29,827 --> 00:15:31,292
Very dangerous.

238
00:15:31,956 --> 00:15:33,730
They call her the medusa spider.

239
00:15:34,168 --> 00:15:35,777
Her pheromones are very strong,

240
00:15:35,885 --> 00:15:39,445
one whiff, and every male of the species
would be here in seconds.

241
00:15:39,952 --> 00:15:41,245
Not unlike you, I guess.

242
00:15:43,452 --> 00:15:45,850
So you're probably too busy
to help me, then.

243
00:15:46,619 --> 00:15:48,143
No, not at all.

244
00:15:48,202 --> 00:15:49,972
I'm fine. I can help you.

245
00:15:50,068 --> 00:15:51,447
What can I do you for?

246
00:15:51,515 --> 00:15:53,515
Well, I'm trying to find my luggage,

247
00:15:53,516 --> 00:15:56,720
and since the plane broke apart
over the jungle,

248
00:15:56,765 --> 00:16:00,451
I was wondering if you knew
about trajectories and stuff.

249
00:16:01,793 --> 00:16:02,891
Do I?

250
00:16:02,953 --> 00:16:04,564
Do I know about trajectories?

251
00:16:05,606 --> 00:16:07,592
Allow me to draw you a map, madam.

252
00:16:12,562 --> 00:16:15,389
Are you sure we should be listening
to a high school science teacher?

253
00:16:15,390 --> 00:16:17,345
Junior high, and yes.

254
00:16:18,194 --> 00:16:20,360
What's your problem with Leslie, anyway?

255
00:16:20,691 --> 00:16:21,691
Leslie?

256
00:16:22,878 --> 00:16:23,878
You're jealous!

257
00:16:24,131 --> 00:16:26,097
Of him? Never.

258
00:16:26,254 --> 00:16:28,409
Yeah, his spiders
turned me on so much,

259
00:16:28,531 --> 00:16:30,470
I had to sleep with him to get the map.

260
00:16:30,524 --> 00:16:32,710
I wouldn't be surprised.
You slept with Zuckerman.

261
00:16:36,344 --> 00:16:37,442
I did that for us.

262
00:16:41,692 --> 00:16:45,003
Okay, I'm sorry. I'm just...
I don't trust that guy.

263
00:16:46,228 --> 00:16:48,459
We should've gone to Ethan.
He would've helped.

264
00:16:48,517 --> 00:16:49,629
Paulo, look.

265
00:16:53,805 --> 00:16:54,942
Another plane.

266
00:16:56,912 --> 00:16:58,320
Looks like it's been here a while.

267
00:16:58,321 --> 00:17:00,632
Go up there.
Maybe there's a radio or some...

268
00:17:00,633 --> 00:17:01,633
Are you insane?

269
00:17:01,685 --> 00:17:03,653
If I go up there,
that thing's gonna fall.

270
00:17:04,467 --> 00:17:05,792
You're not gonna fall.

271
00:17:05,896 --> 00:17:07,560
What? You want me to die?

272
00:17:09,047 --> 00:17:11,013
Come on. Let's keep going.

273
00:17:16,354 --> 00:17:17,492
What is that?

274
00:17:36,836 --> 00:17:38,320
Okay. Let's do it.

275
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:46,437
Let's check it out.

276
00:17:48,277 --> 00:17:51,094
So our carry-on bag fell from the sky,

277
00:17:51,128 --> 00:17:53,116
opened a manhole, crawled inside

278
00:17:53,193 --> 00:17:54,956
and closed the doors
behind itself?

279
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:56,966
You don't wanna climb up to a plane...

280
00:17:57,191 --> 00:18:00,294
but now you want to climb down
a ladder into a dark tunnel?

281
00:18:01,557 --> 00:18:02,557
I don't think so.

282
00:18:09,151 --> 00:18:10,409
Hey, man, be careful.

283
00:18:11,681 --> 00:18:13,455
Why? They don't live here anymore.

284
00:18:13,618 --> 00:18:14,951
So Sun checked the food.

285
00:18:16,223 --> 00:18:19,040
They're eating the same as us,
and no one else is sick.

286
00:18:19,308 --> 00:18:20,308
Could be a virus.

287
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:22,627
Dude... Monster.

288
00:18:25,681 --> 00:18:27,123
Creepy. They collected bugs?

289
00:18:28,478 --> 00:18:30,195
I think these were Arzt's.

290
00:18:30,715 --> 00:18:33,992
He collected all kinds of
different creepy crawlies before he...

291
00:18:34,494 --> 00:18:35,494
Exploded.

292
00:18:35,721 --> 00:18:36,789
They must've been friends.

293
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:39,122
<i>Exposé.</i>

294
00:18:40,101 --> 00:18:41,490
Did you just say <i>Exposé</i>?

295
00:18:42,489 --> 00:18:43,916
What the hell's <i>Exposé</i>?

296
00:18:44,242 --> 00:18:46,657
Only the most awesome hour
of television ever.

297
00:18:46,912 --> 00:18:48,912
It was like <i>Baywatch,</i> only better.

298
00:18:49,133 --> 00:18:52,393
You've got Autumn and Crystal--
two stripers that solve crimes

299
00:18:52,432 --> 00:18:55,895
with the help of their suave,
smooth-talking club owner, Mr. Lashade.

300
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:57,494
How'd I miss that one?

301
00:18:57,644 --> 00:19:00,355
Check it out.
Look at the cast list. Nikki Fernandez.

302
00:19:00,736 --> 00:19:02,820
That's gotta be
why she was in Australia.

303
00:19:02,895 --> 00:19:04,393
This must've been her big break.

304
00:19:04,394 --> 00:19:05,894
Certainly sounds like it.

305
00:19:06,519 --> 00:19:07,519
No way.

306
00:19:08,893 --> 00:19:10,337
Mr. Lashade was the Cobra?

307
00:19:10,630 --> 00:19:12,559
Is that supposed to mean something?

308
00:19:12,706 --> 00:19:14,594
Dude, the Cobra's the big bad guy.

309
00:19:14,956 --> 00:19:17,697
His identity's been shrouded
in mystery for four seasons.

310
00:19:21,339 --> 00:19:22,463
They had a walkie-talkie?

311
00:19:23,163 --> 00:19:25,767
Every damn one of those bastards
on the other side of the island

312
00:19:25,806 --> 00:19:28,025
had one exactly like this
hanging from their belts.

313
00:19:28,104 --> 00:19:29,734
So how did Nikki and Paulo get one?

314
00:19:30,895 --> 00:19:31,895
I'll tell you how.

315
00:19:34,894 --> 00:19:36,571
They were working with the others.

316
00:19:39,758 --> 00:19:41,000
What gives you the right?

317
00:19:41,019 --> 00:19:43,459
You have to understand.
We thought it was best for everybody.

318
00:19:43,517 --> 00:19:44,697
I'm sorry.
Are you my mother?

319
00:19:44,698 --> 00:19:47,320
Because she knows what's best for me.
Other than that, I decide.

320
00:19:47,417 --> 00:19:48,536
Hey. What's going on?

321
00:19:49,821 --> 00:19:52,904
Kate and her two boyfriends found a case
of guns that fell out of the plane,

322
00:19:52,942 --> 00:19:54,602
but they decided not to tell the camp.

323
00:19:54,648 --> 00:19:56,211
Look, the case is locked.

324
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,132
The key is around Jack's neck,
all right?

325
00:19:58,133 --> 00:19:59,624
I promise you, they're safe.

326
00:19:59,695 --> 00:20:01,139
You're all out of control.

327
00:20:02,126 --> 00:20:03,573
The pigs are walkin'.

328
00:20:04,361 --> 00:20:05,928
The pigs are walking!

329
00:20:11,236 --> 00:20:14,947
So... where did you say
you found that case?

330
00:20:19,098 --> 00:20:20,873
It's just water, Paulo.

331
00:20:21,235 --> 00:20:23,249
Stop being such a wuss and dive in.

332
00:20:23,673 --> 00:20:24,673
Why me?

333
00:20:25,049 --> 00:20:27,326
Well, as you had
no trouble reminding me,

334
00:20:27,604 --> 00:20:31,207
I slept with Howie Zuckerman, so
the least you could do is go for a swim.

335
00:20:31,263 --> 00:20:33,244
And Kate said they found the case
on the bottom.

336
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:34,891
- Let me ask you something.
- What?

337
00:20:35,301 --> 00:20:38,509
If you didn't need me to find that bag,
would we still be together?

338
00:20:38,612 --> 00:20:40,748
That bag is worth $8 million.

339
00:20:42,424 --> 00:20:44,407
Just dive in, Paulo.

340
00:21:14,676 --> 00:21:15,676
Well?

341
00:21:18,175 --> 00:21:19,175
Nothing.

342
00:21:19,206 --> 00:21:20,863
There's nothing down there?

343
00:21:24,488 --> 00:21:25,488
Just dead bodies.

344
00:21:35,611 --> 00:21:37,327
Okay, so they had
a walkie-talkie.

345
00:21:37,424 --> 00:21:39,932
You think they were working
with the others? Like, how?

346
00:21:39,990 --> 00:21:41,049
Like Michael.

347
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:44,399
If that's the case,
then why'd they kill Nikki and Paulo?

348
00:21:44,926 --> 00:21:46,916
Who knows why those people do anything?

349
00:21:47,186 --> 00:21:50,080
What matters is they could be out there
right now waiting to get us.

350
00:21:50,237 --> 00:21:51,292
I don't know, dude.

351
00:21:52,051 --> 00:21:53,835
I was with the others,
like, two weeks ago.

352
00:21:53,923 --> 00:21:55,779
They're on the total
other side of the island.

353
00:21:55,862 --> 00:21:57,862
Then who dragged me into the jungle?

354
00:22:00,361 --> 00:22:02,027
The others came into our camp.

355
00:22:02,361 --> 00:22:04,583
They grabbed me, put a bag over my head.

356
00:22:05,175 --> 00:22:07,628
And if I hadn't gotten away,
they would have killed me.

357
00:22:09,697 --> 00:22:10,919
Look, y'all stay here.

358
00:22:11,323 --> 00:22:13,341
Let me see if I can see any sign of 'em.

359
00:22:13,533 --> 00:22:14,922
I'll do a perimeter sweep.

360
00:22:15,049 --> 00:22:17,396
- Where'd you get the gun?
- Got it off one of them.

361
00:22:17,810 --> 00:22:19,585
And when were you gonna let us know?

362
00:22:20,073 --> 00:22:21,287
I guess right now.

363
00:22:27,139 --> 00:22:29,027
What exactly is a perimeter sweep?

364
00:22:30,528 --> 00:22:32,108
Shouldn't we cover them up?

365
00:22:32,323 --> 00:22:33,363
Yes, of course.

366
00:23:02,483 --> 00:23:03,600
Nice night.

367
00:23:07,848 --> 00:23:09,125
- Whatcha doing?
- Nothing.

368
00:23:10,467 --> 00:23:12,481
It looks like you're digging a hole.

369
00:23:16,841 --> 00:23:20,116
Every man's entitled to his secrets,
but can I give you
a piece of advice?

370
00:23:21,343 --> 00:23:22,343
Please, John.

371
00:23:22,406 --> 00:23:25,125
You should put the shovel away
and save yourself some trouble.

372
00:23:25,216 --> 00:23:26,216
Why is that?

373
00:23:27,404 --> 00:23:29,200
Things don't stay buried on this island.

374
00:23:32,408 --> 00:23:33,574
The beach is eroding.

375
00:23:34,581 --> 00:23:36,086
Winter's coming, high tide.

376
00:23:36,469 --> 00:23:40,241
Whatever it is you're hiding, make sure
you pick a spot that won't wash away.

377
00:23:41,333 --> 00:23:42,572
See you back at camp.

378
00:24:34,421 --> 00:24:35,675
<i>Who left this open?</i>

379
00:24:35,758 --> 00:24:37,552
<i>Tom was down here
a couple of days ago.</i>

380
00:24:37,692 --> 00:24:39,698
<i>Well, have him cover it up
with the plane.</i>

381
00:24:48,364 --> 00:24:49,378
That him?

382
00:24:50,149 --> 00:24:51,351
- Shephard?
- Yes.

383
00:24:54,281 --> 00:24:55,281
He's cute.

384
00:24:58,360 --> 00:24:59,537
Why are we doing this?

385
00:25:00,215 --> 00:25:02,481
Shephard will never agree
to do the surgery.

386
00:25:02,592 --> 00:25:04,178
No. I can convince him to do it.

387
00:25:04,819 --> 00:25:05,803
How?

388
00:25:05,906 --> 00:25:08,072
Same way I get anybody to do anything.

389
00:25:09,301 --> 00:25:11,730
I find out what
he's emotionally iested in,

390
00:25:12,778 --> 00:25:13,915
and I exploit it.

391
00:25:16,406 --> 00:25:19,589
So what,
we just grab all three of them,

392
00:25:19,656 --> 00:25:20,822
Ford and Austen, too?

393
00:25:20,856 --> 00:25:22,406
No, they need to come to us.

394
00:25:22,407 --> 00:25:24,129
And how do we make that happen?

395
00:25:24,214 --> 00:25:25,269
Michael, of course.

396
00:25:28,467 --> 00:25:29,467
Are we done here?

397
00:25:30,090 --> 00:25:31,568
This place gives me the creeps.

398
00:26:05,591 --> 00:26:07,527
You hear about what happened
to Nikki and Paulo?

399
00:26:07,528 --> 00:26:08,819
Aye. Tragic.

400
00:26:09,281 --> 00:26:11,051
So... do you know anything?

401
00:26:13,216 --> 00:26:14,216
How do you mean?

402
00:26:14,655 --> 00:26:18,317
Can you... you know,
use your psychic powers?

403
00:26:18,528 --> 00:26:19,805
Doesn't work like that.

404
00:26:21,029 --> 00:26:22,084
I only see flashes.

405
00:26:22,841 --> 00:26:24,174
No offense, dude, but...

406
00:26:25,064 --> 00:26:26,489
as far as superpowers go...

407
00:26:27,801 --> 00:26:29,108
yours is just kinda lame.

408
00:26:30,554 --> 00:26:31,554
Thanks anyway.

409
00:26:33,145 --> 00:26:35,460
I do know she was
with your mate this morning.

410
00:26:37,055 --> 00:26:38,055
My mate?

411
00:26:38,801 --> 00:26:41,023
I saw her with your boy Sawyer...

412
00:26:43,738 --> 00:26:44,960
The dead girl, Nikki.

413
00:26:46,305 --> 00:26:47,805
He said he didn't know her.

414
00:26:48,152 --> 00:26:49,831
Then why was she yelling at him?

415
00:26:50,430 --> 00:26:51,430
Yelling?

416
00:26:53,377 --> 00:26:54,670
At Sawyer, this morning?

417
00:26:58,336 --> 00:26:59,629
Right before she died.

418
00:27:11,826 --> 00:27:13,036
Vincent! Dude!

419
00:27:14,887 --> 00:27:16,887
So he saw Sawyer and Nikki fightin'.

420
00:27:16,966 --> 00:27:20,098
- That doesn't prove athing.
- Look at the facts and ask yourself,

421
00:27:20,467 --> 00:27:22,797
why is Sawyer so gung how
about investigating this?

422
00:27:22,968 --> 00:27:24,134
What's in it for him?

423
00:27:24,278 --> 00:27:26,234
He pretended he didn't know their names,

424
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:27,778
but then he was fighting with Nikki.

425
00:27:27,886 --> 00:27:29,410
Sawyer's not a murderer.

426
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:32,652
He went all the way across
the island to help Michael.

427
00:27:33,404 --> 00:27:35,616
It is the others.
I know what they can do.

428
00:27:36,092 --> 00:27:37,203
Okay, you know what?

429
00:27:37,405 --> 00:27:39,806
I'll go get Desmond.
He'll tell you exactly what he saw.

430
00:27:50,032 --> 00:27:51,032
It was me.

431
00:27:52,212 --> 00:27:53,292
What?

432
00:27:56,073 --> 00:27:59,116
It was me who took you, not the others.

433
00:28:05,282 --> 00:28:06,282
I wasn't myself.

434
00:28:07,592 --> 00:28:08,758
After Locke hit me...

435
00:28:09,243 --> 00:28:10,844
After he humiliated me...

436
00:28:13,216 --> 00:28:15,992
Sawyer told me I could get even
by helping him steal the guns.

437
00:28:16,029 --> 00:28:17,108
We just made it...

438
00:28:18,217 --> 00:28:20,379
look like... the others.

439
00:28:23,904 --> 00:28:25,348
I didn't mean to hurt you.

440
00:28:30,591 --> 00:28:31,591
Sorry.

441
00:28:37,650 --> 00:28:40,244
Hey, everybody.
We're heading out to the pearl station.

442
00:28:40,245 --> 00:28:42,680
There's a computer there that
might help us find our people.

443
00:28:42,681 --> 00:28:44,491
- Anybody wanna come along?
- I'll go.

444
00:28:44,548 --> 00:28:45,986
- Great.
- What?

445
00:28:46,561 --> 00:28:49,243
Anybody else wanna come, meet us
at the tree line in ten minutes,

446
00:28:49,244 --> 00:28:50,244
and bring water.

447
00:28:50,492 --> 00:28:51,547
You're not serious.

448
00:28:52,868 --> 00:28:55,667
What? You always whine
about not being included.

449
00:28:56,044 --> 00:28:57,181
Now's our chance.

450
00:29:04,366 --> 00:29:05,400
Hey, guys,

451
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:08,004
what are these other tvs for?

452
00:29:09,054 --> 00:29:10,054
Sorry?

453
00:29:10,783 --> 00:29:12,055
<i>All these tvs.</i>

454
00:29:12,730 --> 00:29:15,103
<i>This guy says
that there's six stations...</i>

455
00:29:35,877 --> 00:29:39,186
<i>So maybe some of these tvs
are connected to the other hatches.</i>

456
00:29:39,247 --> 00:29:41,022
<i>Well, I'm suddenly feeling very stupid.</i>

457
00:29:41,119 --> 00:29:44,012
<i>Perhaps I could patch in
one of the other feeds,</i>

458
00:29:44,105 --> 00:29:46,169
<i>see if we can get another picture.</i>

459
00:29:57,018 --> 00:29:58,295
The toilet still works.

460
00:30:16,207 --> 00:30:17,207
Give me the gun.

461
00:30:18,033 --> 00:30:19,404
What the hell you talking about?

462
00:30:19,766 --> 00:30:20,766
Give it to me.

463
00:30:23,905 --> 00:30:25,082
It ain't even loaded.

464
00:30:26,518 --> 00:30:28,673
Then how are you
sweeping the perimeter?

465
00:30:29,143 --> 00:30:30,143
Quit lying, dude.

466
00:30:30,258 --> 00:30:32,385
Desmond saw you fighting
with Nikki this morning.

467
00:30:36,895 --> 00:30:38,355
Oh, I see what this is.

468
00:30:39,831 --> 00:30:42,062
The villagers have got
themselves some torches.

469
00:30:42,846 --> 00:30:43,846
Did you kill them?

470
00:30:47,909 --> 00:30:49,186
No, I didn't kill them.

471
00:30:51,346 --> 00:30:53,522
Yeah, me and Nikki
went at it this morning...

472
00:30:55,221 --> 00:30:56,443
'cause she wanted a gun.

473
00:30:56,711 --> 00:30:58,235
Why didn't you tell us this before?

474
00:31:02,971 --> 00:31:04,869
'cause of the dirt under her nails.

475
00:31:05,721 --> 00:31:07,452
- What?
- She was digging,

476
00:31:08,281 --> 00:31:10,665
and when we found him,
I saw a fresh mound of dirt.

477
00:31:11,344 --> 00:31:12,857
She was burying somethin',

478
00:31:13,107 --> 00:31:15,851
and if you take the time to dig a hole
right before you die,

479
00:31:16,845 --> 00:31:19,234
then what you're hiding's
probably pretty damn good.

480
00:31:19,947 --> 00:31:21,095
So what was it?

481
00:31:21,596 --> 00:31:22,596
What did she hide?

482
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:36,615
Go ahead. Take 'em.

483
00:31:38,414 --> 00:31:41,334
'cause whatever happened to those two,
I had nothing to do with it.

484
00:32:05,737 --> 00:32:08,117
Did you know thanksgiving
was two weeks ago?

485
00:32:10,879 --> 00:32:14,049
We missed it, Paulo,
just like we're gonna miss everything.

486
00:32:14,922 --> 00:32:16,310
They're going to find us.

487
00:32:17,051 --> 00:32:18,051
We'll get rescued.

488
00:32:18,365 --> 00:32:19,365
You'll see.

489
00:32:20,362 --> 00:32:24,003
Okay, where did this sudden
burst of optimism come from?

490
00:32:26,114 --> 00:32:27,447
I don't know. I guess...

491
00:32:28,237 --> 00:32:29,903
It's how you look at things...

492
00:32:31,676 --> 00:32:32,676
Like the bag.

493
00:32:33,297 --> 00:32:37,055
I mean,
maybe not finding it was good for us.

494
00:32:37,925 --> 00:32:39,202
How do you figure that?

495
00:32:39,735 --> 00:32:40,735
Look what it did.

496
00:32:42,923 --> 00:32:44,865
It might have... torn us apart.

497
00:32:55,441 --> 00:32:56,541
Wait here.

498
00:32:57,488 --> 00:32:59,265
I'm gonna get us some breakfast.

499
00:33:29,005 --> 00:33:30,739
Okay, I know you have them.

500
00:33:31,549 --> 00:33:32,549
Give me a gun.

501
00:33:33,615 --> 00:33:34,837
I don't have the guns.

502
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:36,472
- A- team took 'em all.
- Right,

503
00:33:36,511 --> 00:33:38,696
except for the ones
you kept for yourself.

504
00:33:39,176 --> 00:33:41,600
Even if I had a gun,
I wouldn't give it to you.

505
00:33:42,172 --> 00:33:44,125
Judging by the fire you're breathin',

506
00:33:44,614 --> 00:33:46,367
I got a feeling
no good would come of it.

507
00:33:46,423 --> 00:33:48,935
Sawyer, give me a gun.

508
00:33:49,489 --> 00:33:51,044
I got a better idea, sister.

509
00:33:51,363 --> 00:33:54,208
How about you go stick your head
in the ocean and cool yourself off?

510
00:33:56,424 --> 00:33:57,479
Thanks for nothin'.

511
00:34:00,739 --> 00:34:02,016
And who the hell are you?

512
00:34:11,299 --> 00:34:12,354
Thanks for nothin'.

513
00:34:29,673 --> 00:34:31,617
Charlie told me it was your idea...

514
00:34:33,614 --> 00:34:34,614
to kidnap me.

515
00:34:43,423 --> 00:34:44,478
You gonna tell Jin?

516
00:34:54,718 --> 00:34:55,799
Why not?

517
00:34:56,052 --> 00:34:58,393
Because then we'd have
to dig another grave.

518
00:35:07,171 --> 00:35:08,464
Why are you giving me these?

519
00:35:09,050 --> 00:35:10,772
Because they're worthless here.

520
00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:15,364
See, I thought I was gonna
get out of this without a...

521
00:35:25,889 --> 00:35:26,987
Nikki and Paulo...

522
00:35:28,798 --> 00:35:30,831
I guess we didn't
really know you very well,

523
00:35:32,989 --> 00:35:36,032
and it appears you killed
each other for diamonds.

524
00:35:37,985 --> 00:35:40,287
But I know there are
good parts to you, too.

525
00:35:40,986 --> 00:35:42,521
You were always nice to me,

526
00:35:45,163 --> 00:35:46,653
and you were a member of the camp.

527
00:35:48,113 --> 00:35:49,113
And...

528
00:35:50,946 --> 00:35:52,683
I really loved <i>Exposé.</i>

529
00:35:56,734 --> 00:35:57,795
Okay, then.

530
00:35:58,215 --> 00:35:59,823
- Good-bye.
- Wait.

531
00:36:13,219 --> 00:36:14,956
Rest in peace, Nikki and Paulo.

532
00:36:22,403 --> 00:36:24,455
Come on, Nikki, just tell me.

533
00:36:24,652 --> 00:36:25,806
It's a surprise.

534
00:36:26,192 --> 00:36:27,247
We're almost there.

535
00:36:29,445 --> 00:36:30,445
Okay, ready?

536
00:36:34,067 --> 00:36:35,253
I found the diamonds.

537
00:36:37,881 --> 00:36:39,654
What? Where?

538
00:36:41,319 --> 00:36:42,319
Right here.

539
00:36:45,691 --> 00:36:46,691
Give them to me.

540
00:36:49,443 --> 00:36:50,943
What are you talking about?

541
00:36:51,129 --> 00:36:52,462
What am I talking about?

542
00:36:53,966 --> 00:36:55,006
What's this?

543
00:36:55,137 --> 00:36:56,254
Your nicotine gum?

544
00:36:56,841 --> 00:36:59,851
You wanted to stop looking for the bag
because you'd already found it.

545
00:37:01,191 --> 00:37:03,357
I know you have them, Paulo,
so where are they?

546
00:37:03,441 --> 00:37:04,727
Calm down, okay?

547
00:37:06,982 --> 00:37:08,217
What the hell is that?

548
00:37:11,598 --> 00:37:12,871
Are you out of your mind?

549
00:37:13,195 --> 00:37:14,706
You remember Dr. Arzt's friend.

550
00:37:15,347 --> 00:37:16,503
Did it bite you?

551
00:37:18,605 --> 00:37:19,608
Does it hurt?

552
00:37:20,445 --> 00:37:22,830
He told me why they call it
"the medusa spider."

553
00:37:22,941 --> 00:37:24,218
Wanna know why?

554
00:37:27,148 --> 00:37:28,194
What did you do?

555
00:37:32,232 --> 00:37:35,512
Because one look from medusa
would turn anyone to stone,

556
00:37:36,066 --> 00:37:38,673
just like one bite from the spider
will paralyze you...

557
00:37:39,378 --> 00:37:41,476
For... oh, about eight hours.

558
00:37:42,693 --> 00:37:43,693
It won't kill you.

559
00:37:43,754 --> 00:37:44,754
It'll just...

560
00:37:44,834 --> 00:37:47,227
slow your heart rate down to the point
where even a doctor

561
00:37:47,265 --> 00:37:48,580
would have a hard time...

562
00:37:49,393 --> 00:37:50,512
hearing it beat.

563
00:37:52,194 --> 00:37:54,420
You won't be able to move a muscle,

564
00:37:54,478 --> 00:37:58,042
so I'll be able to do all sorts
of nasty things to you.

565
00:37:59,473 --> 00:38:01,405
And since it bit you on your neck,

566
00:38:01,612 --> 00:38:04,313
I'd say paralysis will happen fast.

567
00:38:10,111 --> 00:38:12,619
I'm guessing that
you have the diamonds on you.

568
00:38:21,829 --> 00:38:23,004
In a shoe, maybe?

569
00:38:32,069 --> 00:38:33,632
I think I know where.

570
00:38:43,944 --> 00:38:44,944
Son of a bitch.

571
00:38:48,816 --> 00:38:49,816
I'm sorry.

572
00:38:49,987 --> 00:38:51,916
You're only sorry 'cause you got caught.

573
00:38:55,569 --> 00:38:57,805
I was... afraid...

574
00:38:58,801 --> 00:38:59,880
of losing you.

575
00:39:04,020 --> 00:39:05,685
If you found the diamonds...

576
00:39:07,067 --> 00:39:08,586
you wouldn't need me anymore.

577
00:39:48,173 --> 00:39:49,234
Damn it!

578
00:40:15,190 --> 00:40:16,232
You okay?

579
00:40:24,872 --> 00:40:26,019
Hey, what happened?

580
00:40:26,077 --> 00:40:27,578
I'm paralyzed.
