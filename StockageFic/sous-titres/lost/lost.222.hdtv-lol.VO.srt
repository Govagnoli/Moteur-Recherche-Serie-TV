1
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:02,495
Previously on "Lost"...

2
00:00:06,253 --> 00:00:07,250
Michael.

3
00:00:07,391 --> 00:00:09,443
I found them-- the others.

4
00:00:09,771 --> 00:00:13,311
I saw one.
I followed him back to their camp.

5
00:00:13,404 --> 00:00:18,863
They live in tents--
canvas tents and teepees.

6
00:00:19,049 --> 00:00:22,063
They eat dried fish.
They're worse off than we are.

7
00:00:27,275 --> 00:00:28,800
They have a hatch.

8
00:00:29,033 --> 00:00:31,422
They keep it guarded 24/7--

9
00:00:31,562 --> 00:00:36,302
two guards, two guns,
and two guns is all I saw.

10
00:00:36,441 --> 00:00:37,058
Michael?

11
00:00:41,452 --> 00:00:44,031
So I came back to tell you.

12
00:00:44,452 --> 00:00:47,224
- Did you see Walt?
- No.

13
00:00:49,159 --> 00:00:50,860
But I know he's there.

14
00:00:51,331 --> 00:00:53,537
As soon as I get my
strength back...

15
00:00:54,703 --> 00:00:57,098
I will take us back there,

16
00:00:57,653 --> 00:01:00,577
and we are gonna
get my boy back.

17
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:14,705
Hey, John. John. I was hoping I
could borrow one of these guns.

18
00:01:15,411 --> 00:01:17,316
Is this supposed
to be a secret?

19
00:01:17,452 --> 00:01:19,228
- Jack's asleep.
- Oh.

20
00:01:20,532 --> 00:01:22,165
More target practice?

21
00:01:22,301 --> 00:01:25,456
Yeah, well, you know...
just wanna stay sharp.

22
00:01:26,871 --> 00:01:30,307
- You got a date?
- Nah.

23
00:01:30,910 --> 00:01:32,875
Old habits, you know?

24
00:01:33,203 --> 00:01:35,256
- Yes, I do.
- Thanks, man.

25
00:01:35,531 --> 00:01:37,745
Hey, can I just get a
couple of these bullets?

26
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:40,937
I promise I won't--
Ah, damn! I'm sorry.

27
00:01:41,053 --> 00:01:42,606
No, that's all right. I got it.

28
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:59,397
Come on. Where are you?

29
00:02:07,803 --> 00:02:09,807
You okay?

30
00:02:18,802 --> 00:02:20,918
Ok, no time. Come soon?

31
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:31,026
I'm ready. Coming now.
You said north. North where?

32
00:02:41,163 --> 00:02:45,667
When they take me out, there's huge
rocks with a big hole in the middle

33
00:02:45,952 --> 00:02:49,685
by the beach you'll
know when you see.

34
00:02:53,990 --> 00:02:58,666
It's gonna be okay. I'm coming.

35
00:02:58,850 --> 00:02:59,805
I'm coming, Walt.

36
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:00,845
Locke?

37
00:03:06,332 --> 00:03:07,476
John.

38
00:03:10,292 --> 00:03:11,485
Stay in there.

39
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:15,445
- Stay. Michael, what are you--
- Stay in there, jack!

40
00:03:15,583 --> 00:03:19,126
- Hey, whatever's going on--
- I'm going after my son.

41
00:03:19,261 --> 00:03:22,808
I'm going after my son,
and nobody is going to stop me, okay?

42
00:03:22,892 --> 00:03:26,195
Okay, that is my right.
That is a father's right.

43
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:03,035
Hey.

44
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:09,275
- What are you doing out here?
- Nothing. Just getting some air.

45
00:04:09,453 --> 00:04:11,638
Well, come on. We should talk.

46
00:04:20,332 --> 00:04:23,725
- How many?
- Rifles and pistols? 11 total.

47
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:24,476
That's it?

48
00:04:24,662 --> 00:04:27,968
That's it. In case you forgot,
they took five of 'em right off us.

49
00:04:28,091 --> 00:04:29,816
How long would it take
us to get to their camp?

50
00:04:29,841 --> 00:04:32,747
We leave now and move fast--
middle of the night tomorrow.

51
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:35,477
Look, they have no idea
I know where they are.

52
00:04:35,611 --> 00:04:38,965
They won't be expecting us.
So we get the guns and we go,

53
00:04:39,053 --> 00:04:40,496
right now, just the five of us.

54
00:04:40,521 --> 00:04:43,127
No, no, five's not enough.
You said there's at least 20 of them.

55
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:46,175
They've got our guns, and we're
not even sure if what you saw was--

56
00:04:46,203 --> 00:04:47,836
Hey, I know what I saw!

57
00:04:48,202 --> 00:04:50,558
We take too many people,
they'll hear us coming.

58
00:04:50,582 --> 00:04:53,136
I'm not taking a damn army
across the island, Jack.

59
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:56,145
You sure you're in the best place to be
making decisions for all of us
right now?

60
00:04:56,171 --> 00:04:57,947
You got a son, Jack?

61
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,368
They're dead!

62
00:05:04,581 --> 00:05:07,456
Ana Lucia and Libby are dead.

63
00:05:08,332 --> 00:05:10,825
I mean,
we haven't even buried 'em yet.

64
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:20,875
Me and you will
take Libby, okay?

65
00:05:27,731 --> 00:05:29,636
- Can you...
- Yeah, of course.

66
00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:31,258
- Sawyer, would you...
- Yeah.

67
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:34,998
You should stay here.

68
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:38,947
We bury them tonight, and...

69
00:05:39,061 --> 00:05:41,448
then we'll figure
out what's next.

70
00:06:57,453 --> 00:06:58,356
Hey!

71
00:06:59,901 --> 00:07:01,388
Put your hands up.

72
00:07:02,691 --> 00:07:04,938
Put 'em up! Don't move.

73
00:07:05,363 --> 00:07:07,947
Relax, buddy. I ain't movin'.

74
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:10,605
- Why don't you just put that--
- Shut up!

75
00:07:13,131 --> 00:07:15,726
You're Walt's old man,
aren't ya?

76
00:07:16,233 --> 00:07:16,998
What?

77
00:07:29,612 --> 00:07:32,498
What are you doing?!
We need him!

78
00:07:38,973 --> 00:07:40,686
Bag him, quick!

79
00:07:41,662 --> 00:07:43,765
His friends are
right behind us.

80
00:08:01,810 --> 00:08:02,756
Hello.

81
00:08:05,191 --> 00:08:06,946
I didn't hear you come in, man.

82
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:10,478
I left my shoes outside.
They were muddy.

83
00:08:11,881 --> 00:08:14,708
Did you find him? Henry?

84
00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:17,208
No.

85
00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:28,886
I hear you're a priest.

86
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:30,915
Yes.

87
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:34,755
Guess you believe
in hell, then.

88
00:08:39,071 --> 00:08:43,195
For a brief time I served in
a small parish in England.

89
00:08:43,423 --> 00:08:46,146
Every  sunday after mass,

90
00:08:46,233 --> 00:08:50,746
I would see a young boy waiting at
the back of the church, and then

91
00:08:50,831 --> 00:08:56,778
one day the boy confessed to me that he
had beaten his dog to death with
a shovel.

92
00:09:00,242 --> 00:09:05,286
He said the dog had bitten
his baby sister on the cheek,

93
00:09:05,361 --> 00:09:08,158
and he needed to protect her.

94
00:09:09,873 --> 00:09:13,515
And he wanted to know whether
he would go to hell for this.

95
00:09:14,311 --> 00:09:21,547
I told him that god would understand,
that he would be forgiven...

96
00:09:22,111 --> 00:09:24,505
as long as he was sorry.

97
00:09:26,542 --> 00:09:29,707
But the boy did not
care about forgiveness.

98
00:09:30,921 --> 00:09:34,866
He was only afraid that
if he did go to hell...

99
00:09:36,392 --> 00:09:39,946
that dog would be
there waiting for him.

100
00:10:08,493 --> 00:10:09,296
Hey.

101
00:10:13,123 --> 00:10:15,328
- You all right?
- Yeah.

102
00:10:17,901 --> 00:10:19,908
I was coming back
to check on you.

103
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:22,598
Yeah, man.
I had to get out of there.

104
00:10:23,802 --> 00:10:25,237
Just...

105
00:10:26,021 --> 00:10:27,936
I have to get my son back.

106
00:10:28,973 --> 00:10:30,877
We're gonna help you
do that, Michael.

107
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:34,988
It's gotta be the way I said, man.
Just the five of us.

108
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:37,877
Otherwise, it won't work.
It won't work.

109
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:39,606
I promise,
we're gonna figure that out.

110
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:41,607
But I have already
figured it out.

111
00:10:41,732 --> 00:10:43,805
It's gotta be just the
people who already know--

112
00:10:43,832 --> 00:10:48,537
You, me, Kate, Sawyer, Hurley.
That's it. Anybody else, and...

113
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:53,688
Look, it puts him in more danger.
You don't get to decide this.

114
00:10:53,822 --> 00:10:56,947
It's my son! It's my call.

115
00:10:58,191 --> 00:11:00,776
And that's the
way it has to be.

116
00:11:07,821 --> 00:11:10,215
Then that's the way it'll be.

117
00:11:23,742 --> 00:11:24,597
Hey.

118
00:11:26,193 --> 00:11:29,267
Hey, Aaron. Hey, big guy.

119
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:31,555
Hi!

120
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:37,458
- Have you seen Eko?
- No.

121
00:11:40,921 --> 00:11:43,408
You  know,
we're building a church.

122
00:11:45,183 --> 00:11:47,575
Is there something
you want, Charlie?

123
00:11:49,643 --> 00:11:50,787
Yeah.

124
00:11:52,422 --> 00:11:57,317
I found something in the pallet
I thought you might need.

125
00:12:00,682 --> 00:12:02,218
Vaccine?

126
00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:05,055
I don't know what we'd need vaccine for,
but I figured

127
00:12:05,173 --> 00:12:08,136
if anyone should have it,
you and the baby should.

128
00:12:08,243 --> 00:12:12,157
It's all right. It's a...
it's a pneumatic injector.

129
00:12:12,291 --> 00:12:15,888
You just, uh...
you put it into your leg, and...

130
00:12:16,403 --> 00:12:19,035
it goes right in.
Quite painless, really.

131
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:22,136
You seem to knowa lot about it.

132
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:23,697
I tried it.

133
00:12:24,953 --> 00:12:28,506
I wanted to make sure it was safe
before giving it to you and the baby.

134
00:12:28,642 --> 00:12:31,367
Well, how do you feel?
I mean, did it do anything?

135
00:12:31,503 --> 00:12:34,288
- Did it-- what did it do?
- I don't know. I feel fine.

136
00:12:34,602 --> 00:12:40,256
Anyway, it says you're supposed to
give yourself a shot every nine days.

137
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:45,575
All right? So there's enough here
for you and the babyfor a while.

138
00:12:45,843 --> 00:12:47,156
That's it.

139
00:12:51,032 --> 00:12:53,236
All right. I'll put it...

140
00:12:53,462 --> 00:12:57,057
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

141
00:12:57,380 --> 00:12:59,726
I should really feed him, so...

142
00:12:59,903 --> 00:13:04,427
Yeah. Hey, Claire? Do you think
maybe you and I could, um...

143
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:09,625
Oh, my god. Michael's back.

144
00:13:25,132 --> 00:13:26,321
Michael?

145
00:13:48,922 --> 00:13:49,874
Okay?

146
00:13:50,059 --> 00:13:53,110
Uh, yeah, yeah.
It's good to see you, too.

147
00:13:56,882 --> 00:13:58,505
Are you all right?

148
00:13:58,653 --> 00:14:02,175
Yeah. I'm...
it's just... I'm fine.

149
00:14:19,531 --> 00:14:20,436
Who?

150
00:14:22,382 --> 00:14:24,028
Ana Lucia and Libby.

151
00:14:25,621 --> 00:14:27,356
What happened to them?

152
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,825
They were murdered.

153
00:14:48,793 --> 00:14:50,325
Hey there, Michael.

154
00:14:54,401 --> 00:14:56,468
Not gonna hold
that against you.

155
00:14:56,653 --> 00:15:00,105
Fair's fair. I took your boy.

156
00:15:00,702 --> 00:15:03,477
But don't do that again, okay?

157
00:15:03,612 --> 00:15:05,895
Where is he,
you son of a bitch?

158
00:15:06,590 --> 00:15:08,796
Hey, lookie what I found.

159
00:15:08,933 --> 00:15:12,098
She was following her friends.
About half a klick behind us.

160
00:15:12,323 --> 00:15:14,675
You make one sound...

161
00:15:16,612 --> 00:15:19,895
you'll never see
your boy again.

162
00:15:21,112 --> 00:15:22,406
Gag him.

163
00:15:22,651 --> 00:15:27,187
Get ready with the torches.
I'm gonna go talk to her people.

164
00:15:33,621 --> 00:15:35,147
I think we better head back.

165
00:15:35,281 --> 00:15:35,858
What?

166
00:15:36,013 --> 00:15:37,997
- Just to find the trail, John.
- I've lost the trail.

167
00:15:38,023 --> 00:15:41,018
You don't just lose a trail.
You just don't wanna find him.

168
00:15:41,122 --> 00:15:43,946
Yeah, that's right, Jack.
I've been running through the jungle

169
00:15:43,971 --> 00:15:46,767
toward the sun of gunfire because
I don't care about Michael.

170
00:15:46,792 --> 00:15:49,488
You know what happens if we
just turn around and go back?

171
00:15:49,510 --> 00:15:53,197
We're never gonna see him again,
and that's gonna be on us,

172
00:15:53,332 --> 00:15:56,255
on you and on me.

173
00:15:56,382 --> 00:15:59,896
You're exactly right, Jack.

174
00:16:01,422 --> 00:16:02,418
Who are you?

175
00:16:02,553 --> 00:16:04,967
He's the son of a bitch
that shot me on the raft.

176
00:16:04,990 --> 00:16:07,006
Why  don't you
point the gun down?

177
00:16:10,303 --> 00:16:13,837
It's okay.
He's just delivering a message.

178
00:16:15,092 --> 00:16:17,965
He has to scare your
friends to do it.

179
00:16:18,621 --> 00:16:21,688
- I don't believe you.
- You don't believe what?

180
00:16:21,823 --> 00:16:24,237
I think there's more of
us than there are of you.

181
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:26,667
That's an interesting theory.

182
00:16:26,832 --> 00:16:29,278
Light 'em up!

183
00:16:32,512 --> 00:16:36,536
Give me your weapon.
Turn around. Go home.

184
00:16:36,683 --> 00:16:37,778
No.

185
00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:42,247
I hoped it wouldn't
come to this.

186
00:16:42,391 --> 00:16:44,237
Bring her out, Alex!

187
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:47,957
Go on.

188
00:16:48,152 --> 00:16:50,126
- You...
- Come on, Alex.

189
00:16:50,222 --> 00:16:51,626
Please?

190
00:16:56,110 --> 00:16:58,717
Let's go. Up. Up.

191
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:05,147
Is Claire okay?

192
00:17:06,663 --> 00:17:10,307
Did she have the baby?
Is it okay?

193
00:17:10,670 --> 00:17:13,467
Is it a boy or a girl?

194
00:17:14,670 --> 00:17:18,806
Like I said, curiosity...

195
00:17:27,332 --> 00:17:29,937
You and me ain't done, Zeke.

196
00:17:49,753 --> 00:17:54,646
His friends are going home.
Divvy 'em up.

197
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:05,406
Sorry.

198
00:18:34,233 --> 00:18:36,085
What do you say, doc?

199
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:41,017
Here I was thinking the irish
drink when somebody dies.

200
00:18:41,391 --> 00:18:42,976
I'm not irish.

201
00:18:43,352 --> 00:18:44,965
Neither am I.

202
00:18:47,733 --> 00:18:50,465
So what happened out
there in the jungle?

203
00:18:50,802 --> 00:18:53,057
Exactly what he said happened.
He found the camp--

204
00:18:53,082 --> 00:18:56,385
I ain't talking about Mike.
You and freckles...

205
00:18:56,943 --> 00:19:01,266
Before you found him.
Y'all were gone all night.

206
00:19:01,630 --> 00:19:03,517
We were caught in a net.

207
00:19:04,712 --> 00:19:06,615
What the hell's that
supposed to mean?

208
00:19:06,711 --> 00:19:10,208
It means we got
caught in a net.

209
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:13,688
That what they're
calling it these days?

210
00:19:16,362 --> 00:19:18,567
Is  it true? Henry is gone?

211
00:19:19,751 --> 00:19:20,525
Yeah.

212
00:19:20,701 --> 00:19:21,856
Who's going after him?

213
00:19:22,013 --> 00:19:23,855
Locke and Eko went out in
the middle of the night.

214
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:25,787
But we ain't seen
either of 'em since.

215
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:27,436
Those are the guns,
aren't they?

216
00:19:27,443 --> 00:19:28,896
What are you doing with them?

217
00:19:28,921 --> 00:19:31,728
What do you think we're doing?
It's time to finish this.

218
00:19:31,781 --> 00:19:33,418
- When do we leave?
- In the mornin'.

219
00:19:33,442 --> 00:19:35,165
You're not coming, Sayid.

220
00:19:36,623 --> 00:19:37,647
Excuse me?

221
00:19:37,761 --> 00:19:41,838
Michael wants to keep it small--
me, Kate, Hurley and-- and him.

222
00:19:41,973 --> 00:19:45,566
Well, "him" says even though Pippi
Longstocking and the damn grape ape

223
00:19:45,723 --> 00:19:47,526
are ideal candidates
for the dirty dozen,

224
00:19:47,551 --> 00:19:50,026
I'm  just gonna say we might
wanna bring the red beret.

225
00:19:50,050 --> 00:19:52,905
It's Michael's call.
He knows where we're going.

226
00:19:53,003 --> 00:19:57,265
It is not his call, Jack.
It's ours.

227
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:02,876
Welcome aboard.

228
00:20:51,752 --> 00:20:54,875
So... you wake up in
the middle of the night,

229
00:20:54,952 --> 00:20:57,708
you grab your Jesus stick
and race off into the jungle.

230
00:20:57,823 --> 00:21:00,408
You don't call.
You don't write.

231
00:21:00,553 --> 00:21:02,146
I'm sorry.

232
00:21:03,002 --> 00:21:04,746
I had work to do.

233
00:21:04,911 --> 00:21:06,898
Right. Yeah.

234
00:21:07,243 --> 00:21:11,268
Charlie, would
you do me a favor?

235
00:21:13,430 --> 00:21:17,408
I was hoping you could bring
my things from the beach here.

236
00:21:17,490 --> 00:21:18,447
What for?

237
00:21:20,151 --> 00:21:21,908
You moving in here?

238
00:21:22,662 --> 00:21:25,577
Fancy yourself a
little bachelor pad?

239
00:21:25,772 --> 00:21:29,126
Yes. I am moving in here.

240
00:21:29,382 --> 00:21:32,927
Well, what about the church?

241
00:21:33,072 --> 00:21:35,976
You said we were supposed to
be building it together, man.

242
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:39,638
I am supposed to do
something different now.

243
00:21:45,712 --> 00:21:48,226
What am I supposed to do?

244
00:21:49,621 --> 00:21:52,167
Bring me my things.

245
00:21:55,681 --> 00:21:57,526
Bring your own things.

246
00:21:57,710 --> 00:21:59,235
Charlie, please.

247
00:21:59,371 --> 00:22:01,336
You'd better leg it, mate.

248
00:22:01,661 --> 00:22:03,148
Clock's tickin'.

249
00:22:17,093 --> 00:22:19,187
Got some good news for ya.

250
00:22:19,292 --> 00:22:22,957
Captain A-rab's in, too.
Cavalry ride's at sunrise.

251
00:22:23,073 --> 00:22:26,007
- You told Sayid?
- Yeah, I told Sayid.

252
00:22:26,411 --> 00:22:28,445
You shouldn'thave done that!

253
00:22:29,090 --> 00:22:32,057
Oh, well, I'm sorry.
I just figured if we're going to war,

254
00:22:32,213 --> 00:22:34,845
we'd want the one guy who's
actually been in a war.

255
00:22:34,932 --> 00:22:36,367
That a problem?

256
00:22:39,271 --> 00:22:40,637
Well, no.

257
00:22:41,601 --> 00:22:43,696
It's not a problem.

258
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:46,367
All right, then.

259
00:23:04,852 --> 00:23:06,686
Get off of me!

260
00:23:06,801 --> 00:23:08,348
You got a problem, Michael?

261
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:11,916
You march me a day and a
night without any rest, yeah.

262
00:23:12,003 --> 00:23:13,347
My problem is I'm tired.

263
00:23:13,481 --> 00:23:16,895
Well, I'd offer to knock you out
and carry you, but we're here.

264
00:24:03,321 --> 00:24:04,928
Put him right over here.

265
00:24:10,793 --> 00:24:12,537
Tell her we're here.

266
00:24:19,953 --> 00:24:22,157
I can't promise
this won't hurt.

267
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:25,175
What the... Ow! Damn it!

268
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:27,305
Relax. Just taking some blood.

269
00:24:27,473 --> 00:24:31,566
Taking some blood for what?
Who are you people? Where's my son?

270
00:24:32,572 --> 00:24:34,346
That's it. All done.

271
00:24:38,711 --> 00:24:40,637
See ya in the funny pages.

272
00:24:45,042 --> 00:24:47,838
- Hello, Michael.
- Where's my son?

273
00:24:48,042 --> 00:24:50,338
My name is Ms. Klugh.

274
00:24:52,263 --> 00:24:56,087
I was hoping you might help
me answer some questions...

275
00:24:58,691 --> 00:25:00,078
about Walt.

276
00:25:00,630 --> 00:25:04,295
- Where is he?
- Is he your biological son?

277
00:25:05,210 --> 00:25:08,477
- What?
- Are you his father?

278
00:25:08,650 --> 00:25:09,636
Yes, I'm his--

279
00:25:09,742 --> 00:25:12,875
How old was he when
he started speaking?

280
00:25:12,993 --> 00:25:14,596
I... she...

281
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:18,398
Did he have any illnesses growing up?
Headaches? Fainting spells?

282
00:25:18,543 --> 00:25:19,997
What? No!

283
00:25:22,590 --> 00:25:24,506
I don't-- I wasn't there!

284
00:25:24,833 --> 00:25:26,806
He was halfway
around the world.

285
00:25:26,941 --> 00:25:28,476
Why are you asking me
all these questions?

286
00:25:28,502 --> 00:25:33,926
Did Walt ever appear in a
place he wasn't supposed to be?

287
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:40,885
You say he was halfway
around the world, but...

288
00:25:41,123 --> 00:25:43,468
- did you see--
- I want my son!

289
00:25:43,883 --> 00:25:49,735
You bring him to me right now!
I wanna see my boy!

290
00:25:53,151 --> 00:25:57,576
For someone who wants
his son back so badly...

291
00:25:57,661 --> 00:26:01,476
you don't seem to know
much about him, Michael.

292
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:21,545
Hey. You're not coming.

293
00:26:23,012 --> 00:26:24,648
Welcome back, Michael.

294
00:26:24,790 --> 00:26:27,428
Look, I know Sawyer told you,
all right, but, uh,

295
00:26:27,503 --> 00:26:29,885
it's not gonna work.
You're not coming.

296
00:26:30,023 --> 00:26:32,465
And why is it that
I'm not coming?

297
00:26:32,871 --> 00:26:35,505
Because you're going
after the guy who escaped,

298
00:26:35,593 --> 00:26:37,715
and I'm going after my son.

299
00:26:37,850 --> 00:26:41,886
Are you implying I'd let a desire
for revenge compromise Walt's safety?

300
00:26:42,051 --> 00:26:46,865
I'm implying that I decide who
stays and who goes, and you stay.

301
00:26:53,102 --> 00:26:57,055
I know you wanna help, right?

302
00:26:58,942 --> 00:27:01,978
But I've gotta do this my way.

303
00:27:12,830 --> 00:27:14,208
Of course.

304
00:27:18,363 --> 00:27:24,505
- Good luck, Michael.
- Yeah. Thanks.

305
00:27:38,863 --> 00:27:40,306
Bloody hell.

306
00:27:53,971 --> 00:27:55,535
Are you kidding me?

307
00:27:58,040 --> 00:28:00,176
Did someone put you up to this?

308
00:28:12,241 --> 00:28:13,248
Vincent?

309
00:29:44,530 --> 00:29:46,688
You were supposed
to come right back.

310
00:29:46,970 --> 00:29:49,578
You were out in the jungle all night.
What happened?

311
00:29:51,423 --> 00:29:54,658
We were unable to
find Henry's trail.

312
00:29:55,351 --> 00:29:57,116
Yeah, I got that.

313
00:29:59,033 --> 00:30:00,205
Where's Locke?

314
00:30:01,001 --> 00:30:02,616
I do not know.

315
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:09,507
We're burying Ana Lucia
and Libby at sunset.

316
00:30:11,353 --> 00:30:12,615
Thank you.

317
00:30:13,450 --> 00:30:16,067
I will mourn them
in my own way.

318
00:30:31,262 --> 00:30:32,987
Who's gonna talk?

319
00:30:34,062 --> 00:30:35,137
What?

320
00:30:35,550 --> 00:30:37,257
At the funeral.

321
00:30:37,581 --> 00:30:39,387
Who's gonna talk?

322
00:30:39,901 --> 00:30:42,858
Well, I'm sure Hurley will
wanna say something about Libby.

323
00:30:43,563 --> 00:30:45,476
I never even knew
her last name.

324
00:30:48,141 --> 00:30:50,217
Ana Lucia.

325
00:30:51,132 --> 00:30:52,677
It's Cortez.

326
00:30:53,691 --> 00:30:55,125
Cortez.

327
00:30:57,003 --> 00:30:58,847
Well, there you go.

328
00:31:07,642 --> 00:31:09,468
I screwed her.

329
00:31:11,213 --> 00:31:12,777
What?

330
00:31:13,682 --> 00:31:18,436
That's how she got my gun.
Ana-- she jumped me.

331
00:31:20,613 --> 00:31:23,635
We got caught in a net.

332
00:31:29,862 --> 00:31:32,376
Why are you telling
me this, Sawyer?

333
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:43,268
'Cause you're about the closest
thing I got to a friend, doc.

334
00:31:47,213 --> 00:31:48,687
'Cause she's gone.

335
00:31:55,662 --> 00:31:59,235
Well, at least now we
get to kill somebody.

336
00:32:27,663 --> 00:32:29,738
Jack fill you in on the plan?

337
00:32:30,552 --> 00:32:32,038
What plan?

338
00:32:32,223 --> 00:32:33,925
We're leaving first
thing tomorrow

339
00:32:34,062 --> 00:32:36,295
back across the
island to their camp.

340
00:32:37,972 --> 00:32:38,808
Okay.

341
00:32:39,741 --> 00:32:42,067
What about you, man?
You coming with us?

342
00:32:43,881 --> 00:32:45,596
Why would I want to go?

343
00:32:48,421 --> 00:32:49,947
Because they killed her.

344
00:32:50,421 --> 00:32:53,076
Michael, come on.

345
00:32:53,861 --> 00:32:55,747
What do you say, Hugo?

346
00:33:00,292 --> 00:33:04,885
Sorry about Walt, dude,
but I'm not coming.

347
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:08,977
- You're sorry about--
- Michael.

348
00:33:55,462 --> 00:33:56,767
Dinner time.

349
00:34:03,703 --> 00:34:05,338
When you gonna do it?

350
00:34:06,403 --> 00:34:08,095
When I am going to do what?

351
00:34:08,270 --> 00:34:09,228
Kill me.

352
00:34:15,133 --> 00:34:18,777
I've seen where you live.
I know how to get here.

353
00:34:18,883 --> 00:34:21,058
You have been
asking me questions

354
00:34:21,223 --> 00:34:24,677
I don't know the
answer to for a week.

355
00:34:26,611 --> 00:34:28,665
I don't even think my
son is alive, and--

356
00:34:28,723 --> 00:34:32,995
He is alive, Michael.
He's standing outside right now.

357
00:34:34,692 --> 00:34:37,088
What do you think, I'm stupid?

358
00:34:37,601 --> 00:34:41,758
There's been a development
since you came here, Michael.

359
00:34:41,831 --> 00:34:44,398
One of our people was
captured by yours.

360
00:34:44,532 --> 00:34:47,348
- So go get him back.
- We can't do that.

361
00:34:48,971 --> 00:34:51,135
But you can.

362
00:34:55,350 --> 00:34:57,318
And if you do...

363
00:34:58,943 --> 00:35:01,417
we'll let you and Walt go free.

364
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:10,408
I wanna see my son.

365
00:35:10,591 --> 00:35:12,598
- Michael--
- I wanna see him!

366
00:35:12,751 --> 00:35:15,415
If he is out there,
you bring him in!

367
00:35:17,282 --> 00:35:20,215
You bring him in
here right now!

368
00:35:28,011 --> 00:35:29,087
Pickett?

369
00:35:36,523 --> 00:35:38,678
You have three minutes.

370
00:35:44,663 --> 00:35:45,638
Walt?

371
00:35:46,853 --> 00:35:47,685
Dad.

372
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:49,958
Let him go.

373
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:52,096
Let him go!
Get your hands off him right now!

374
00:35:52,122 --> 00:35:53,048
Dad, don't!

375
00:35:53,322 --> 00:35:55,358
Are you okay, huh?

376
00:35:56,433 --> 00:35:57,287
Yeah.

377
00:35:58,202 --> 00:36:00,586
Are you-- did they hurt you?

378
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:06,096
- They make me take tests.
- They make you what?!

379
00:36:06,260 --> 00:36:08,477
We're not gonna
talk about that.

380
00:36:10,063 --> 00:36:12,026
How's Vincent?

381
00:36:12,182 --> 00:36:15,308
Vincent's... he's great.

382
00:36:15,471 --> 00:36:17,548
He's great. He misses you.

383
00:36:18,183 --> 00:36:21,128
Hey, don't be scared, man.
Don't be scared.

384
00:36:21,211 --> 00:36:23,037
It's gonna be over
real soon, okay?

385
00:36:23,212 --> 00:36:24,806
I'm gonna get you
out of here, okay?

386
00:36:24,830 --> 00:36:26,197
They're not who they
say they are...

387
00:36:26,223 --> 00:36:27,315
- Walt!
- They're pretending!

388
00:36:27,343 --> 00:36:29,037
Do you want me to put
you in the room again?

389
00:36:29,062 --> 00:36:31,378
- Pretending? Pretending what?!
- Okay, that's it. We're done.

390
00:36:31,402 --> 00:36:33,205
No,  no, no, no, wait.
Hey, wait, wait, wait, wait!

391
00:36:33,231 --> 00:36:35,645
Come here, walt!
Wait, come here, wait. Come here!

392
00:36:35,670 --> 00:36:39,715
Dad. Don't leave me.
Help me, please. Don't leave me.

393
00:36:40,023 --> 00:36:42,557
I won't, man.
I'm gonna get you outta here, okay?

394
00:36:42,653 --> 00:36:44,806
I promise you,
I will get you out of here!

395
00:36:44,891 --> 00:36:47,707
- Dad, dad!
- Let him go! Let go of him!

396
00:36:47,792 --> 00:36:48,728
I love you!

397
00:36:48,883 --> 00:36:50,586
Walt, I'm gonna get
you out of here!

398
00:36:50,613 --> 00:36:52,465
- I love you!
- I love you, too, Walt!

399
00:36:52,512 --> 00:36:55,238
Put me down! Let me go! !Dad!

400
00:37:16,233 --> 00:37:20,898
After you release our man,
I'm gonna need you to do something else.

401
00:37:23,411 --> 00:37:24,225
I'll do it.

402
00:37:26,942 --> 00:37:28,628
Whatever you want.

403
00:37:30,112 --> 00:37:34,538
I'm writing four names down--
four of your friends.

404
00:37:35,073 --> 00:37:37,446
We need you to bring them here.

405
00:37:39,442 --> 00:37:45,586
You have to bring only these
four people, Michael, just them.

406
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:51,287
If you don't bring all
the people on the list...

407
00:37:55,333 --> 00:37:57,857
you'll never see Walt again.

408
00:37:58,370 --> 00:38:01,235
Yeah. Okay.

409
00:38:02,883 --> 00:38:06,466
Do you understand, Michael?

410
00:38:07,940 --> 00:38:12,576
- What do I tell them?
- It doesn't matter.

411
00:38:13,150 --> 00:38:15,317
Make up a story.

412
00:38:16,523 --> 00:38:19,646
They'll be angry enough to
believe whatever you say.

413
00:38:25,910 --> 00:38:28,468
Who's James Ford?

414
00:38:28,743 --> 00:38:32,525
You know him as "Sawyer."
You know the rest of them?

415
00:38:33,461 --> 00:38:34,366
Yeah.

416
00:38:40,043 --> 00:38:41,337
I know them.

417
00:38:45,472 --> 00:38:47,475
If I do all this...

418
00:38:48,031 --> 00:38:50,555
if I do what you say...

419
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:53,166
You'll get your son back.

420
00:38:54,481 --> 00:38:57,145
You'll both go free.

421
00:39:05,092 --> 00:39:06,906
And I want the boat.

422
00:40:24,521 --> 00:40:29,235
When the plane crashed, I was on my
way to Los Angeles to bury my dad.

423
00:40:29,401 --> 00:40:31,048
I'm sorry to hear that.

424
00:40:32,111 --> 00:40:35,085
It seems like such
a long time ago now.

425
00:40:35,273 --> 00:40:38,637
I was gonna go right from the
airport to the cemetery, but...

426
00:40:39,330 --> 00:40:41,475
I had no idea what
I was gonna say.

427
00:40:44,620 --> 00:40:46,306
Here we are again.

428
00:40:50,671 --> 00:40:53,795
I think Michael has
been compromised.

429
00:40:54,342 --> 00:40:56,795
Let's keep walking, Jack.

430
00:40:57,863 --> 00:40:59,117
What do you mean, compromised--

431
00:40:59,141 --> 00:41:02,678
His actions are not those of a
man who is telling the truth.

432
00:41:02,863 --> 00:41:04,408
Why would he lie to us?

433
00:41:04,580 --> 00:41:07,435
Because I believe a father
would do anything for his son,

434
00:41:07,540 --> 00:41:10,098
because I believe that
Michael may have freed Henry,

435
00:41:10,122 --> 00:41:12,885
and because I believe he's
leading you into a trap.

436
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:14,635
You believe a lot, Sayid.

437
00:41:14,730 --> 00:41:17,856
And I also believed that
Henry was one of them.

438
00:41:24,193 --> 00:41:25,676
All right.
Let's go talk to him.

439
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:28,386
No, he must continue to
believe he's in control.

440
00:41:28,653 --> 00:41:30,398
Why the hell would
we want to do that?

441
00:41:30,423 --> 00:41:33,057
So we can create an advantage.

442
00:41:36,620 --> 00:41:37,538
- How?
-

443
00:41:37,933 --> 00:41:40,247
I don't know yet.

444
00:41:40,521 --> 00:41:43,256
But we have one more
night to figure that out.

445
00:41:47,543 --> 00:41:50,308
Ana Lucia Cortez was...

446
00:41:52,082 --> 00:41:55,627
before we crashed,
she was a police officer.

447
00:41:56,971 --> 00:41:59,625
I don't think it was
easy for her being here,

448
00:41:59,741 --> 00:42:02,287
but I think she did
the best she could.

449
00:42:03,772 --> 00:42:08,817
She was a woman of few words,
and I'm gonna follow her example.

450
00:42:11,203 --> 00:42:13,835
Rest in peace, Ana.

451
00:42:27,030 --> 00:42:28,925
Libby was...

452
00:42:32,530 --> 00:42:33,747
she was...

453
00:42:35,553 --> 00:42:36,297
she...

454
00:42:39,190 --> 00:42:41,615
Libby was a psychologist.

455
00:42:44,170 --> 00:42:47,246
Or... psychiatrist.

456
00:42:49,810 --> 00:42:51,605
One of those.

457
00:42:51,723 --> 00:42:55,135
By the way,
she probably helped a lot of people.

458
00:42:57,101 --> 00:42:58,598
She helped me.

459
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:03,206
She was my friend.

460
00:43:04,851 --> 00:43:07,905
It's not fair that this happened to her.
It's not.

461
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:19,098
I'm going with you.

462
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:29,435
Good-bye, Libby.

463
00:43:59,110 --> 00:44:00,265
Boat.

464
00:44:03,370 --> 00:44:04,308
Boat!
