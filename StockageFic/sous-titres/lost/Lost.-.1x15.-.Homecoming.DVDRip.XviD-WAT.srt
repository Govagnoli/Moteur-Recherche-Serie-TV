Claire...

48
00:03:08,087 --> 00:03:10,385
We were all on that plane.

lt crashed here, on this island.

50
00:03:16,996 --> 00:03:18,793
That was almost a month ago.

51
00:03:20,667 --> 00:03:22,396
No! l'm due...

Your baby's fine.
He's kicking.

Everything's normal. Okay?

54
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:34,341
Well, if it's been a month,
then why hasn't somebody come to get us?

[speaking in Korean]

56
00:04:16,522 --> 00:04:18,251
You think she escaped?

57
00:04:18,992 --> 00:04:22,052
You were right beside me, Boone.
You know as much as l do.

58
00:04:22,128 --> 00:04:24,255
But where'd she come from?

59
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:25,820
We were out pretty deep.

60
00:04:25,898 --> 00:04:28,366
Nothing's out there.

61
00:04:29,135 --> 00:04:31,035
She didn't say anything
about Ethan?

62
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:33,231
She doesn't even remember Ethan.

63
00:04:33,306 --> 00:04:36,537
The guy pretends to be one of us,
he drags her into the jungle.

64
00:04:36,609 --> 00:04:38,099
She doesn't remember him?

65
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:41,208
Apparently.

66
00:04:45,551 --> 00:04:47,416
You think he's around?

67
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:52,083
l sure hope not.

68
00:04:54,027 --> 00:04:57,519

And this is where you sleep.
lt's quite cozy, isn't it?

71
00:05:14,914 --> 00:05:17,940
When he, Ethan...

72
00:05:18,017 --> 00:05:22,147
...when he took you away,
he took me too.

73
00:05:23,589 --> 00:05:25,819
The others came after us.

74
00:05:25,892 --> 00:05:29,293
They got me back. But you...

75
00:05:29,362 --> 00:05:30,886
You were gone.

76
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:34,997
Who is he? Ethan?

77
00:05:38,237 --> 00:05:40,569
Ethan...

78
00:05:42,608 --> 00:05:44,701
Ethan's the bad guy.

79
00:05:46,112 --> 00:05:48,979
So we were together when...

80
00:05:49,048 --> 00:05:50,675
Yeah.

81
00:05:53,219 --> 00:05:54,982
Well, why did he leave you?

82
00:05:56,656 --> 00:06:00,456
Why don't we leave that lovely story
for the morning?

83
00:06:01,627 --> 00:06:03,424
You've had enough for one day.

84
00:06:03,496 --> 00:06:04,986
No, l won't be sleeping.

85
00:06:05,498 --> 00:06:08,797
Oh... lucky for me.

86
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:11,530
Not much of a sleeper myself.

87
00:06:11,604 --> 00:06:13,799
Finally, l'll have someone
to stay up with.

88
00:06:17,677 --> 00:06:19,474
We're... We're friends?

89
00:06:22,915 --> 00:06:27,375
Yeah. Yeah, we're friends.

90
00:06:33,426 --> 00:06:35,519
[sniffing]

91
00:06:36,629 --> 00:06:38,688
[man] How's that feel, mate?

92
00:06:39,766 --> 00:06:43,497
- Sodding fantastic.
- Good, 'cause we're almost out.

93
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:47,300
[Charlie] But we're not out yet?
Carpe diem, my friend.

94
00:06:47,373 --> 00:06:49,773
Save your French for someone
who appreciates it.

95
00:06:49,842 --> 00:06:52,402
Latin, Tommy. lt's Latin.

96
00:06:52,478 --> 00:06:55,208
Well, is it Latin for
''l've got a pile of money

97
00:06:55,281 --> 00:06:59,945
so we can score vast quantities
of illicit substances''?

98
00:07:00,019 --> 00:07:03,147
- No.
- l suppose you ought to clean up then.

99
00:07:03,222 --> 00:07:05,315
lt's time to put you to work.

100

[rock music plays]

Just graduated from Oxford,

old dad, Mr. Francis Price Heatherton,

104
00:07:26,045 --> 00:07:28,878
who, my friend,
is bloody loaded.

105
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:32,179
How you amass this information
never ceases to amaze me.

106
00:07:32,985 --> 00:07:35,283
Ready to fall in love,
Mr. Charlie Pace

107
00:07:35,354 --> 00:07:38,221
of the legendary rock band
Drive Shaft?

108
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:42,794
Absolutely.

109
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:56,533
Oh! Seriously, ladies, l demand you
stop buying me more drinks.

110
00:07:58,010 --> 00:08:01,036
l'm a man of
high moral standing.

111
00:08:01,113 --> 00:08:04,412
Your obvious plan to take me home
and ravage me will not work.

112
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:06,452
Saucy sirens.

113
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:09,511
l believe in monogamy.
l will not be shared like a curry.

114
00:08:09,589 --> 00:08:12,319
- Are we that obvious?
- Dreadfully.

115
00:08:12,391 --> 00:08:15,224
Call yourself ladies.
Jane Austen would be ashamed.

116
00:08:16,529 --> 00:08:20,522
[Charlie] l personally
feel misunderstood. l'm sensitive.

117
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:27,464
The girl is pregnant.
Very pregnant.

118
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:29,770
Are we to believe
that she escaped from him?

119
00:08:29,842 --> 00:08:32,333
- What're you getting at?
- Ethan infiltrated us.

120
00:08:32,411 --> 00:08:36,142
Whoever he is and wherever
he comes from, he's intelligent.

121
00:08:36,215 --> 00:08:39,514
- Who's to say he didn't send Claire?
- You're off your head, mate.

122
00:08:39,585 --> 00:08:42,349
Charlie. Calm down.
That's a stretch, Sayid.

123
00:08:42,421 --> 00:08:45,549
Tell me, doctor, how many times
have you diagnosed amnesia?

124
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:48,458
- And such a selective brand of it?
- [Jack] Okay. lt's rare.

125
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:49,995
She's been through a trauma.

126
00:08:50,062 --> 00:08:52,792
lt is possible that her memory
reset to the crash.

127
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:57,195
And the chances of
that memory returning?

128
00:08:59,438 --> 00:09:01,565
- l don't know.
- [Charlie] You know what?

129
00:09:01,641 --> 00:09:04,735
Talk about Claire all you want.
l'm gonna spend time with her.

130
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:07,301
l get the impression
she might be a tad upset.

131
00:09:13,686 --> 00:09:15,517
[Charlie] Oi, Jin.

132
00:09:15,588 --> 00:09:17,715

back to the caves?

133
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:21,817
- [Charlie speaks Korean]
- [Jin speaks Korean]

134
00:09:21,894 --> 00:09:23,953
Safety in numbers, right?

135
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:27,431
Of course, you have no idea
what l'm talking about.

136
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:31,560
How nice it must be to not be involved
in the bloody insanity

137
00:09:31,637 --> 00:09:34,162
that surrounds us at every turn.

138
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,105
lt's quite beautiful really.

139
00:09:36,175 --> 00:09:38,006
You take care of your wife.

140
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:40,739
Everything else
is someone else's problem.

141
00:09:40,813 --> 00:09:44,146
No need to be involved in
the decision-making process.

142
00:09:44,216 --> 00:09:48,016
No tree-shaking behemoths,
French transmissions.

143
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:50,555
Just sweet bloody ignorance.

144
00:09:50,623 --> 00:09:52,318
You don't know
how lucky you are.

145
00:09:52,391 --> 00:09:54,325
Must be nice.
You wake up and...

[whooshing]

147
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,465

148
00:10:02,535 --> 00:10:04,628
[whooshing increases in speed]

[birds crying]

151
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:20,779
Charlie, l want her back.

152
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:24,756
- What?
- l want you to bring her back.

153
00:10:26,892 --> 00:10:28,257
What did you do to her?

154
00:10:31,197 --> 00:10:32,755
What did you do?

155
00:10:32,832 --> 00:10:35,596
[choking]

156
00:10:39,372 --> 00:10:40,600
You bring her here.

157
00:10:42,408 --> 00:10:46,970
lf you don't, l'm going to
kill one of them.

158
00:10:47,046 --> 00:10:50,072
Then if you don't bring her back
before sundown tomorrow,

159
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:51,912
l'll kill another.

160
00:10:51,984 --> 00:10:53,576
And another.

161
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:57,346
And another.

162
00:10:57,423 --> 00:10:59,687
One every day.

163
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:01,317
And, Charlie,

164
00:11:02,995 --> 00:11:05,429
l'll kill you last.

165
00:11:11,237 --> 00:11:12,932

166
00:11:13,005 --> 00:11:15,735
[grunting]

167
00:11:24,884 --> 00:11:26,545
What do we do?

168
00:11:26,619 --> 00:11:28,712
- We go out and we kill him.
- Calm down.

169
00:11:28,788 --> 00:11:30,722
We don't want the others
to get upset.

170
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:34,089
- Forget them. He's out there now.
- l think he's right.

171
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:37,754
The man threatens
to kill one of us, and what?

172
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:39,764
We just wait for that to happen?

173
00:11:39,832 --> 00:11:42,733
We tracked him once before.
We can track him again.

174
00:11:42,802 --> 00:11:46,101
You've forgotten how that turned out.
He bested you. Physically.

175
00:11:46,172 --> 00:11:48,333
He hung you from a tree.

176
00:11:48,407 --> 00:11:50,773
Running into the jungle
is not gonna get it done.

177
00:11:50,843 --> 00:11:53,539
- So, what does get it done?
- We circle the wagons.

178
00:11:53,612 --> 00:11:57,104
Tell a select few, we post them
as sentries here and at the caves.

179
00:11:57,183 --> 00:11:58,445
''Tell a select few''?

180
00:11:59,351 --> 00:12:02,980
He does what he says he's gonna do,
and that blood's on our hands.

181
00:12:06,692 --> 00:12:09,252
Okay, Jack, we tell everyone.

182
00:12:09,328 --> 00:12:12,126
But you wanna protect them,
you need to think defense.

183
00:12:12,198 --> 00:12:15,190
We move everybody off the beach
back up into the caves.

184
00:12:15,267 --> 00:12:17,132
What if Ethan isn't alone?

185
00:12:18,604 --> 00:12:22,062
What if he delivered his threat
so that we would gather like sheep

186
00:12:22,141 --> 00:12:26,874
in a space where they could roll in
and take us all in one fell swoop?

187
00:12:29,181 --> 00:12:30,614
Okay, John.

188
00:12:30,683 --> 00:12:34,244
l mean, obviously you have a plan,
so let's hear it.

189
00:12:40,126 --> 00:12:42,390
[speaking in Korean]

190
00:12:59,812 --> 00:13:03,179
- [Claire] The others are avoiding me.
- Sorry?

191
00:13:03,249 --> 00:13:05,581
No one will talk to me.

192
00:13:05,651 --> 00:13:09,519
You know, it just feels
like something's going on.

193
00:13:11,991 --> 00:13:14,789
Anything coming back?

194
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:16,987
After the crash, no.

195
00:13:17,062 --> 00:13:19,587
Some of this stuff
is probably better forgotten.

196
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:24,402
l don't know about you, but the rest
of us been having a wonderful time.

197
00:13:25,938 --> 00:13:28,168
We even built a golf course.

198
00:13:32,244 --> 00:13:34,735
You sure there's
nothing going on?

199
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:40,077
Absolutely.

200
00:13:43,088 --> 00:13:44,214
Okay.

201
00:13:48,394 --> 00:13:50,555
[door opening]

202
00:13:50,629 --> 00:13:52,620
You're quite enamored of yourself.

203
00:13:52,698 --> 00:13:56,259
Now, Lucy, l know it's our first date,
and you need to appear demure,

204
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:58,098
but if you want to
invite me for sex,

205
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:01,833
don't say ''tea,'' say ''sex.''

206
00:14:01,907 --> 00:14:04,307
- Do you want tea or not?
- l'd love some.

207
00:14:04,376 --> 00:14:05,809
Brilliant.

208
00:14:05,878 --> 00:14:08,244
So where is the old man?

209
00:14:08,314 --> 00:14:09,906
[Lucy] l don't know.

210
00:14:09,982 --> 00:14:13,383
l think he's buying
some paper company up in Slough.

211
00:14:13,886 --> 00:14:16,411
Oh, yeah?

212
00:14:16,488 --> 00:14:18,012
You two get on?

213
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:20,854
[Lucy] Dad's quite cool, actually.

214
00:14:20,926 --> 00:14:24,794
He was proud when l told him l was going
on a date with a bona fide rock star.

215
00:14:30,302 --> 00:14:32,736
lt was Winston Churchill's.

216
00:14:34,306 --> 00:14:38,265
Dad collects all sorts of rubbish
from the great leaders of the Empire.

217
00:14:38,344 --> 00:14:41,142
- Hey, you should meet him.
- Winston? No, thanks.

218
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:44,705
- l heard he's quite moldy.
- My father.

219
00:14:44,783 --> 00:14:48,116
He's coming back tomorrow.
You should come around for dinner.

220
00:14:50,289 --> 00:14:51,278
l'd love to.

221
00:14:53,058 --> 00:14:54,389
Excellent.

222
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:04,725
You look hungry.

223
00:15:08,641 --> 00:15:10,370
Thanks.

224
00:15:17,783 --> 00:15:19,250
Locke told us what happened.

225
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:25,087
Why do you think
he wants her back?

226
00:15:26,725 --> 00:15:28,420
l don't know.

227
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:36,993
Maybe it's time you used that key
you've been wearing around your neck.

228
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:39,969
There are four 9 millimeters
in the case...

229
00:15:40,039 --> 00:15:41,028
Uh-uh. No.

230
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:44,700
l hand them out, someone
hears something, gets scared...

231
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:47,678
Chance of shooting each other
is higher than shooting him.

232
00:15:47,746 --> 00:15:49,179
We're beyond knives.

233
00:15:49,248 --> 00:15:51,842
l'm not putting guns
in untrained hands.

234
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,291
Trip it.

235
00:16:04,563 --> 00:16:05,757
Not bad.

236
00:16:05,831 --> 00:16:08,026
Four around the perimeter
will do the job.

237
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:11,661
- l have fires at 20-meter intervals.
- Excellent.

238
00:16:11,737 --> 00:16:15,002
Some have volunteered for sentry duty.
l'll put them on shifts.

239
00:16:15,074 --> 00:16:16,132
l'll take a shift.

240
00:16:17,376 --> 00:16:18,365
Okay.

241
00:16:19,945 --> 00:16:22,175
Absolutely.
We're counting on you.

242
00:16:28,954 --> 00:16:32,151
- Maybe we should move her.
- She's safer here.

243
00:16:32,224 --> 00:16:34,249
What about the mountain?
Another cave?

244
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:37,557
- She's safer here.
- Nobody's safe!

245
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:40,298
Hey.

246
00:16:41,367 --> 00:16:43,835
lt's my fault he took her.
l was responsible.

247
00:16:43,902 --> 00:16:46,268
l should've taken care of her.
l should've...

248
00:16:47,206 --> 00:16:50,642
Nothing's gonna
happen to her. Okay?

249
00:16:53,278 --> 00:16:54,506
Yeah. Okay.

250
00:17:06,759 --> 00:17:09,250
[Heatherton] l think my daughter
would agree that

251
00:17:09,328 --> 00:17:14,129
you are the most impressive person
who's ever had dinner with us.

252
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:16,030
- My condolences, sir.
- [giggles]

253
00:17:16,101 --> 00:17:19,901
l don't know if Lucy mentioned it,
but l was in a band once, you know.

254
00:17:19,972 --> 00:17:21,337
Oh!

255
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:23,807
They were called
The Protestant Reformation.

256
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:25,434
Yes. Ouch! Dreadful.

257
00:17:26,378 --> 00:17:27,811
You gave it up, then?

258
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:30,542
Well, l was married,
Lucy was on the way.

259
00:17:30,616 --> 00:17:33,312
Her mum, God rest her soul,
wanted me to keep trying,

260
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:36,650
but l always wanted
to be more practical.

261
00:17:37,222 --> 00:17:39,087
Responsible, l guess.

262
00:17:39,158 --> 00:17:42,594
You know, a man has to provide,
take care of his family.

263
00:17:42,661 --> 00:17:44,754
A man has to think
about the future.

264
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:46,991
And, of course,
your band was bloody awful.

265
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:49,466
Yes, there was that too.
Small detail.

266
00:17:49,535 --> 00:17:51,560
So, are you working
on a new album?

267
00:17:53,439 --> 00:17:55,737
We're in a bit of
a hiatus right now.

268
00:17:58,644 --> 00:18:02,307
Liam, my brother,
just had a daughter.

269
00:18:02,381 --> 00:18:06,545
So, you know,
we're taking some time off.

270
00:18:12,024 --> 00:18:13,457
Quite a lot of time off.

271
00:18:13,525 --> 00:18:17,222
lt's been a year
since we were together.

272
00:18:21,133 --> 00:18:23,124
l'm thinking of doing
a solo project.

273
00:18:23,202 --> 00:18:26,501
Liam and l don't exactly
keep in touch,

274
00:18:26,572 --> 00:18:31,100
and there's been
some problems with...

275
00:18:31,176 --> 00:18:33,007
...royalties.

276
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:41,545
The fact of the matter is, sir, uh,

277
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:44,350
l think that Drive Shaft

278
00:18:44,423 --> 00:18:47,085
might be dead.

279
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:55,566
- [Tommy] You took a sodding what?
- A job.

280
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:56,794
A job? Doing what?

281
00:18:59,538 --> 00:19:02,268
- Selling copiers.
- You took a job selling copiers?

282
00:19:02,341 --> 00:19:04,502
- l like her.
- She's a moose.

283
00:19:04,576 --> 00:19:07,511
- Don't say that.
- Are you off your bleeding chump, man!

284
00:19:07,579 --> 00:19:10,878
l've been getting you off on my scag
for over a week now, on spec.

285
00:19:10,949 --> 00:19:13,509
- Spec means ''speculation.''
- Yes, l know what...

286
00:19:13,585 --> 00:19:17,419
ln this case, the speculation that
you'll execute your end of the plan

287
00:19:17,489 --> 00:19:20,583
and steal something of value
which l can in turn sell.

288
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:22,991
By the time the bird
realizes it's missing,

289
00:19:23,061 --> 00:19:27,225
it never even occurs to her
that rock star Charlie bloody Pace

290
00:19:27,299 --> 00:19:31,326
could be responsible for such larceny,
and the bloody party continues.

291
00:19:34,373 --> 00:19:35,704
Look, l...

292
00:19:37,209 --> 00:19:40,269
l don't think Liam's coming back.

293
00:19:40,345 --> 00:19:42,506
- l have to think about my future.
- Future?

294
00:19:42,581 --> 00:19:43,570
- Yeah.
- Really?

295
00:19:43,649 --> 00:19:46,209
- Yes.
- When do you start this job?

296
00:19:46,285 --> 00:19:49,254
- Monday.
- Well, today's Friday, isn't it?

297
00:19:49,321 --> 00:19:53,382
A full weekend without a fix.
Monday should be bloody wonderful.

298
00:19:53,458 --> 00:19:56,518
Let's see how the future
treats you then, eh, Charlie?

299
00:20:37,402 --> 00:20:40,701
[sighs]

300
00:20:53,685 --> 00:20:56,017
[crashing]

301
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:57,817
[rustling]

302
00:21:26,818 --> 00:21:28,285
[grunts]

303
00:21:30,756 --> 00:21:32,747
- [man] Over here.
- [barking]

304
00:21:32,824 --> 00:21:35,588
[Locke] The tree line.
Something tripped the alarm.

305
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:49,934
l think we found
another missing castaway.

306
00:21:50,008 --> 00:21:52,602
[woman screaming]

307
00:21:57,716 --> 00:22:00,116
- [Locke] What happened?
- [Sayid] ls he alive?

308
00:22:00,185 --> 00:22:01,880
- Oh, God.
- How did he get past us?

309
00:22:17,803 --> 00:22:21,466
[Hurley] l thought those guys
had the full-on perimeter set up.

310
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:23,007
Locke said it didn't matter.

311
00:22:24,276 --> 00:22:25,971
He came in from the water.

312
00:22:30,082 --> 00:22:34,178
You sure it wasn't an accident?
l mean, maybe the guy just drowned.

313
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:38,048
[Kate] His neck was broken. Both arms.
All bones in his fingers.

314
00:22:38,123 --> 00:22:41,490
[Hurley] Yeah. Okay. Got it.

315
00:22:43,462 --> 00:22:46,260
Guess old Steve
drew the short straw.

316
00:22:47,766 --> 00:22:49,461
Dude, that was Scott.

317
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:05,714
[Hurley] Scott Jackson worked for
an lnternet company in Santa Cruz.

318
00:23:05,784 --> 00:23:08,218
He won a sales prize.

319
00:23:08,286 --> 00:23:11,414
Two-week Australian vacation,
all expenses paid.

320
00:23:12,657 --> 00:23:14,488
He was a good guy.

321
00:23:15,293 --> 00:23:18,126
l'm sorry l kept
calling you Steve, man.

322
00:23:20,365 --> 00:23:24,529
- Um... Amen, l guess.
- Amen.

323
00:23:25,103 --> 00:23:27,333
l don't know how to end these.

324
00:23:44,923 --> 00:23:46,686
Hi. Um...

325
00:23:46,758 --> 00:23:48,589
Why is everyone staring at me?

326
00:23:49,528 --> 00:23:52,224
- l'm not staring at you.
- What's your name?

327
00:23:53,698 --> 00:23:56,690
- Shannon.
- Shannon, you're staring.

328
00:24:00,038 --> 00:24:03,007
- You mean nobody's told you?
- Told me what?

329
00:24:05,243 --> 00:24:08,542
Why? Why did you lie to me?

330
00:24:08,613 --> 00:24:11,173
- Okay, look...
- What else didn't you tell me?

331
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:14,844
l thought there wasn't
anything that you could do.

332
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,387
Nothing l could do?

333
00:24:18,457 --> 00:24:21,085
Why would you keep me in the dark?

334
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:24,023
l'm already in the dark.

335
00:24:25,397 --> 00:24:26,955
Sorry.

336
00:24:27,999 --> 00:24:30,194
l just wanted to
take care of you.

337
00:24:30,268 --> 00:24:32,532
l can take care of myself.

338
00:24:41,179 --> 00:24:45,809
[Lucy] Look at you. Charlie Pace,
respectable businessman.

339
00:24:45,884 --> 00:24:48,182
You didn't have
to buy me this suit.

340
00:24:48,253 --> 00:24:51,484
Mm-hmm. What did you intend
on wearing for your first day?

341
00:24:52,090 --> 00:24:55,389
l have shirts with buttons.

342
00:24:56,628 --> 00:25:00,155
- You okay?
- Yeah, just nervous.

343
00:25:00,232 --> 00:25:02,200
Don't be. Dad's put the fix in.

344
00:25:02,267 --> 00:25:05,464
He's demanded they buy two copiers
to boost your confidence.

345
00:25:05,537 --> 00:25:07,596
Ah!

346
00:25:09,774 --> 00:25:13,938
- You memorized the manual?
- Backwards and forwards.

347
00:25:15,247 --> 00:25:17,112
Say something impressive.

348
00:25:18,083 --> 00:25:20,483
[clears throat] Uh...

349
00:25:20,552 --> 00:25:25,489
The Heatherton C81 5
Copy Center's leading scan offerings

350
00:25:25,557 --> 00:25:28,287
combine the benefits
of document capture

351
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:32,922
with instant delivery
anywhere, anytime.

352
00:25:32,998 --> 00:25:35,592
- Anywhere?
- Anytime, baby.

353
00:25:36,902 --> 00:25:40,463
You've been on stage in front
of thousands of screaming fans.

354
00:25:40,539 --> 00:25:43,736
This is just some men who want
to buy a silly copy machine.

355
00:25:43,808 --> 00:25:47,244
You're gonna do great.
l believe in you.

356
00:25:48,313 --> 00:25:50,941
Oh! l almost forgot. Wait here.

357
00:25:51,016 --> 00:25:52,347
Okay.

358
00:26:06,765 --> 00:26:08,733
All right,
l know you'll protest,

359
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:12,167
but you simply can't be respected
unless you have one of these.

360
00:26:12,737 --> 00:26:15,501
Oh, Lucy.

361
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:18,937
You're welcome.

362
00:26:19,344 --> 00:26:21,676
Okay, well...

363
00:26:21,746 --> 00:26:23,714
l'm gonna be late. The bus...

364
00:26:23,782 --> 00:26:25,647
The bus? Are you daft?

365
00:26:25,717 --> 00:26:28,811
- l'm driving you.
- Oh, no, l'd rather you didn't.

366
00:26:28,887 --> 00:26:32,152
No arguments.
You have everything you need?

367
00:26:33,658 --> 00:26:36,354
- Yeah.
- Then let's get you to work.

368
00:26:43,969 --> 00:26:46,028
John.

369
00:26:46,104 --> 00:26:48,231
Wanna take a walk?

370
00:26:50,875 --> 00:26:52,809
[Jack] What happens
after the sun sets?

371
00:26:52,877 --> 00:26:55,641
Well, if we don't
bring Claire to him?

372
00:26:55,714 --> 00:26:57,375
Rhetorical, Jack.

373
00:26:57,449 --> 00:27:00,009
Same thing happens tonight
happened last night.

374
00:27:00,085 --> 00:27:02,485
- You think you can track him?
- What, l'm sorry?

375
00:27:02,554 --> 00:27:04,681
We know where
he attacked Jin and Charlie.

376
00:27:04,756 --> 00:27:06,690
You think you could
pick up the trail?

377
00:27:06,758 --> 00:27:09,090
- Maybe, but l wouldn't.
- Wouldn't?

378
00:27:10,795 --> 00:27:13,992
Jack, l'm not a cold man.

379
00:27:14,065 --> 00:27:15,896
l feel for the loss
of one of our own.

380
00:27:15,967 --> 00:27:17,867
But nothing fundamental's changed.

381
00:27:17,936 --> 00:27:21,201
Whoever he is, wherever he comes from,
we're on Ethan's turf.

382
00:27:21,272 --> 00:27:22,705
He has the advantage.

383
00:27:22,774 --> 00:27:26,938
To him we're nothing more than
scared idiots with sharp sticks.

384
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:32,411
What if l told you that l had
a way to get the advantage back?

385
00:27:33,385 --> 00:27:35,819
Then l would ask,
''What way might that be?''

386
00:28:03,815 --> 00:28:06,181
Why, doctor,
you've been holding out on us.

387
00:28:11,189 --> 00:28:13,680
l'm guessing you know
how to handle one of these.

388
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:36,506
Are you insane?

389
00:28:36,548 --> 00:28:39,608
- lt's the best chance we have.
- No bloody way.

390
00:28:39,684 --> 00:28:42,676
To capture Ethan, we have to
ensnare him. The only way to do it

391
00:28:42,754 --> 00:28:45,518
- is by giving him what he wants.
- You have no idea.

392
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:48,081
This guy, he will kill all of you.

393
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:51,959
- You can't protect yourself...
- Charlie! l can talk for myself.

394
00:28:52,330 --> 00:28:55,788
Claire.
They want to use you as bait.

395
00:28:58,136 --> 00:29:00,001
l don't remember Ethan.

396
00:29:00,071 --> 00:29:02,733
l don't remember
what he did to me.

397
00:29:02,807 --> 00:29:05,833
But if l can help stop him
from hurting anyone else,

398
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:07,400
l have to do that.

399
00:29:10,248 --> 00:29:11,647
l'm coming with you.

400
00:29:11,716 --> 00:29:13,684
You said there were four guns.

401
00:29:13,752 --> 00:29:16,050
You ever fire a weapon, Charlie?

402
00:29:23,862 --> 00:29:25,591
All right, we should do this.

403
00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:30,228
[Jack] Let's figure out a game plan.
All right, Sayid, soldier.

404
00:29:30,301 --> 00:29:32,360
Locke, you're the hunter.

405
00:29:32,437 --> 00:29:35,031
[Charlie] Allow me to demonstrate
the awesome speed

406
00:29:35,106 --> 00:29:37,506
of the C81 5 using...

407
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:40,337
...one of your...

408
00:29:40,411 --> 00:29:43,574
...technical manuals.

409
00:29:51,623 --> 00:29:53,113
[beeps]

410
00:29:54,826 --> 00:29:58,057
[beeping]

411
00:29:58,129 --> 00:30:02,725
Not a problem.
There's probably... something in here.

412
00:30:09,908 --> 00:30:11,307
One second. One second.

413
00:30:12,076 --> 00:30:13,270
Bear with me.

414
00:30:15,547 --> 00:30:17,606
[sighs]

415
00:30:21,586 --> 00:30:23,076
[retching]

416
00:30:29,694 --> 00:30:31,218
Charlie's right.

417
00:30:32,363 --> 00:30:33,853
About what?

418
00:30:33,932 --> 00:30:37,527
We have four guns.
We should have four men.

419
00:30:42,407 --> 00:30:45,501
[Sawyer] Help? <i>Moi?</i>

420
00:30:45,577 --> 00:30:47,943
You know how to
handle a gun or not?

421
00:30:48,012 --> 00:30:50,572
l know at least one
polar bear seems to think so.

422
00:30:57,789 --> 00:30:59,689
Where'd you get
the hardware, hoss?

423
00:30:59,757 --> 00:31:01,691
[cocks gun]

424
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:03,320
l wanna come.

425
00:31:04,128 --> 00:31:05,425
Sorry. We're out of guns.

426
00:31:05,496 --> 00:31:08,329
And no one goes
out there unarmed.

427
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:11,791
How much ammo you got?

428
00:31:15,139 --> 00:31:18,165
- Hundred rounds, give or take.
- All nines, right?

429
00:31:19,677 --> 00:31:21,736
Nine millimeters? The guns?

430
00:31:21,813 --> 00:31:23,474
Yeah. Why?

431
00:31:23,548 --> 00:31:26,483
'Cause if the lady wants to come...

432
00:31:32,257 --> 00:31:35,226
Lifted this off the marshal
back in the old days.

433
00:31:36,027 --> 00:31:37,790
You remember him, don't you?

434
00:31:37,862 --> 00:31:41,320
Surly guy, kind of a square jaw?
Carried a Sig nine?

435
00:31:41,399 --> 00:31:44,732
Yeah. l remember you shot him.
And missed.

436
00:31:45,770 --> 00:31:48,705
Yeah, well... bygones.

437
00:31:50,942 --> 00:31:54,241
And, hell, five guns
are better than four.

438
00:32:11,396 --> 00:32:13,523
You'll be surrounded
at five points.

439
00:32:13,598 --> 00:32:15,532
Everyone will be in visual contact.

440
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:18,694
Make sure you stay
in the area l've shown you.

441
00:32:19,437 --> 00:32:22,201
And remember, the guns are
a measure of the last resort.

442
00:32:22,273 --> 00:32:24,707
We want him alive.

443
00:32:43,561 --> 00:32:46,189
[thunder rumbling]

444
00:33:53,998 --> 00:33:56,296
[rustling]

445
00:33:57,068 --> 00:33:59,332
[screaming]

446
00:34:15,086 --> 00:34:17,145
[yelling]

447
00:34:21,692 --> 00:34:24,456
[straining, grunting]

448
00:34:48,119 --> 00:34:49,381
[Locke] Over here.

449
00:34:50,721 --> 00:34:52,518
Jack's got him.

450
00:34:56,694 --> 00:34:58,525
Hold your fire. Don't shoot!

451
00:34:58,596 --> 00:35:00,086
We want him alive.

452
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:11,298
[Locke] Claire!

453
00:35:11,876 --> 00:35:13,776
- You all right?
- Yeah.

454
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:17,507
[Sawyer] Over here.

455
00:35:17,582 --> 00:35:19,812
- Hey! Hold your fire!
- Easy!

456
00:35:36,634 --> 00:35:39,569
Winner by a knockout.
Nice one, doc.

457
00:35:39,637 --> 00:35:42,765
Maybe somebody can tell me
who or what this son of a bitch is.

458
00:35:44,175 --> 00:35:47,576
Uh-uh-uh, jungle boy,
not even for one sec.

459
00:36:01,192 --> 00:36:03,183
[Jack] Charlie?

460
00:36:48,072 --> 00:36:50,131
Why did you do it, Charlie?

461
00:36:54,478 --> 00:36:56,776
'Cause he deserved to die.

462
00:37:00,084 --> 00:37:02,678
He could've told us
where he came from.

463
00:37:02,753 --> 00:37:04,516
What he wanted with Claire.

464
00:37:04,589 --> 00:37:07,387
Do you really think
he would've told us anything?

465
00:37:11,929 --> 00:37:15,956
l wasn't gonna let that animal
anywhere near her again.

466
00:37:16,634 --> 00:37:18,295
Ever.

467
00:37:38,256 --> 00:37:39,985
Lucy.

468
00:37:40,057 --> 00:37:42,753
l'm sorry.
l've been having some problems.

469
00:37:42,827 --> 00:37:44,988
- lf l could just explain.
- Leave, Charlie.

470
00:37:45,062 --> 00:37:47,155
Lucy.

471
00:37:47,231 --> 00:37:50,530
- l made a mistake.
- You made a mistake?

472
00:37:50,601 --> 00:37:52,899
My father's sales manager
comes to my house

473
00:37:52,970 --> 00:37:55,962
to return a cigarette case
the EMTs pulled from your pocket

474
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:58,941
at the bloody hospital,
and it still smells of your sick.

475
00:38:00,544 --> 00:38:03,342
- l didn't mean...
- Oh, you meant to.

476
00:38:03,414 --> 00:38:06,542
You meant to from the start.
You're a liar.

477
00:38:06,617 --> 00:38:08,380
l believed you, and you lied!

478
00:38:08,452 --> 00:38:10,886
l thought you wanted to...

479
00:38:10,955 --> 00:38:13,082
You said...

480
00:38:13,157 --> 00:38:15,125
You selfish bastard!

481
00:38:15,192 --> 00:38:17,683
- lf l can just explain...
- Just tell me one thing,

482
00:38:17,762 --> 00:38:19,821
and don't you dare lie to me.

483
00:38:19,897 --> 00:38:23,060
l get why you
pretended to like me.

484
00:38:24,201 --> 00:38:26,032
l understand why you stole,

485
00:38:26,103 --> 00:38:28,401
because you're a junkie,

486
00:38:30,941 --> 00:38:34,377
but l don't understand
why you took the job.

487
00:38:36,314 --> 00:38:38,839
Why did you take the job, Charlie?

488
00:38:44,121 --> 00:38:47,818
l guess l...

489
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:54,825
...wanted to be respectable.

490
00:38:58,769 --> 00:39:01,897
l wanted you to think
that l could take care of you.

491
00:39:04,809 --> 00:39:07,243
You'll never take care of anyone.

492
00:39:52,456 --> 00:39:54,481
l remember peanut butter.

493
00:39:57,194 --> 00:39:59,685
Why do l remember peanut butter?

494
00:40:04,235 --> 00:40:07,398
lt was imaginary
peanut butter, actually.

495
00:40:11,809 --> 00:40:14,243
l don't know what happened to me.

496
00:40:19,617 --> 00:40:21,448
l'm scared.

497
00:40:28,225 --> 00:40:30,819
l want to trust you.

498
00:40:41,505 --> 00:40:43,336
Good night, Charlie.

499
00:40:44,375 --> 00:40:46,275
Good night, Claire.
