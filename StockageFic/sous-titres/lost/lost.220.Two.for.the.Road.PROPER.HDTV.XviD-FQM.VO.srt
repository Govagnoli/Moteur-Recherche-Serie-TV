1
00:00:00,254 --> 00:00:02,065
Previously on "Lost"...

2
00:00:02,158 --> 00:00:03,154
Jason.

3
00:00:07,712 --> 00:00:09,799
These people are smart.

4
00:00:10,313 --> 00:00:12,220
And they're animals,

5
00:00:12,313 --> 00:00:15,175
and if you think that
one gun and one bullet

6
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:17,031
is gonna stop them,

7
00:00:18,015 --> 00:00:19,873
think again.

8
00:00:20,669 --> 00:00:24,299
I'm going after my son,
and nobody is going to stop me, okay?

9
00:00:24,486 --> 00:00:25,436
I'll come with you.

10
00:00:25,536 --> 00:00:27,192
No. I have to do it alone.

11
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:29,782
I'm going out to the line that
we're not supposed to cross

12
00:00:29,810 --> 00:00:32,723
and telling them
that we've got you.

13
00:00:33,003 --> 00:00:34,957
They'll never give you Walt.

14
00:00:42,695 --> 00:00:43,930
Michael.

15
00:00:45,882 --> 00:00:46,829
Michael.

16
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:50,361
Michael.

17
00:00:51,393 --> 00:00:52,867
What's wrong with him?

18
00:00:53,008 --> 00:00:55,392
Michael. Michael?

19
00:00:55,719 --> 00:00:56,619
Michael.

20
00:01:00,071 --> 00:01:02,074
Jack? Where are you going?

21
00:01:02,166 --> 00:01:03,737
Maybe they just let him go.

22
00:01:05,003 --> 00:01:06,907
Let him go-- he's alone!

23
00:01:07,046 --> 00:01:10,821
They didn't just push him out into
the jungle, Jack. He's alone!

24
00:01:15,463 --> 00:01:16,554
Okay.

25
00:01:17,632 --> 00:01:19,059
Let's go.

26
00:01:57,666 --> 00:01:58,902
See ya, Ana Lucia.

27
00:02:04,763 --> 00:02:08,280
- You look tired.
- Yeah, thanks.

28
00:02:10,436 --> 00:02:11,288
What?

29
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:13,901
Where were you last night?

30
00:02:14,137 --> 00:02:16,182
- Home.
- All night?

31
00:02:16,538 --> 00:02:19,929
Yeah. Cooked myself some dinner,
watched some tv.

32
00:02:20,069 --> 00:02:21,497
What'd you watch?

33
00:02:25,856 --> 00:02:27,475
Let's go for a drive.

34
00:02:33,336 --> 00:02:35,674
Remember Jason Alder?

35
00:02:37,456 --> 00:02:40,637
Found him in a parking lot just
after 3:00 in the morning.

36
00:02:40,778 --> 00:02:43,401
He was dead an hour
before anyone saw him.

37
00:02:43,542 --> 00:02:45,692
Crime scene pulled a
gun from the dumpster.

38
00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:49,311
Registration was filed off--
no prints, no witnesses.

39
00:02:49,451 --> 00:02:51,071
He was executed.

40
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:54,250
Any idea who did it?

41
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:57,907
Yeah, Ana. You did.

42
00:02:58,328 --> 00:03:00,809
This man confesses to
shooting you in cold blood,

43
00:03:00,949 --> 00:03:04,245
and you refuse to I.D.
him, so we had to cut him loose.

44
00:03:04,525 --> 00:03:06,925
A week later, he shows up with
five bullets in his chest,

45
00:03:06,955 --> 00:03:09,196
because someone shot
him in cold blood.

46
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:13,045
Guess I should get a lawyer.

47
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:17,819
Look, we both know that this is
gonna be a dead-end investigation.

48
00:03:18,004 --> 00:03:20,533
But, Ana, if you did this...

49
00:03:20,721 --> 00:03:23,825
if you did this,
you have to let me help you.

50
00:03:24,151 --> 00:03:26,536
Yeah, thanks, mom,
but I don't need your help.

51
00:03:26,675 --> 00:03:30,355
You don't want my help? You're gonna
have to get it from somewhere else.

52
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,999
You're a police officer, Ana.

53
00:03:37,201 --> 00:03:40,975
If you don't respect me,
at least respect that.

54
00:03:47,682 --> 00:03:49,109
Then I quit.

55
00:04:02,691 --> 00:04:06,614
Hey, Henry. What do you say?

56
00:04:09,188 --> 00:04:12,578
How long you gonna keep up
this hunger strike, Henry?

57
00:04:19,496 --> 00:04:22,361
Did I ever tell
you I was a cop?

58
00:04:24,893 --> 00:04:28,096
I've been around a lot
of killers in my life.

59
00:04:28,652 --> 00:04:31,420
You know what surprises
me the most about 'em?

60
00:04:33,579 --> 00:04:36,684
How much they love to talk.

61
00:04:39,167 --> 00:04:42,080
But you're different... Henry.

62
00:04:43,626 --> 00:04:44,477
Hmm?

63
00:04:45,837 --> 00:04:46,841
Quiet.

64
00:04:53,351 --> 00:04:55,065
What was that?

65
00:04:59,492 --> 00:05:02,931
If you're gonna say something,
you're gonna have to speak--

66
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:12,429
You killed two of us--

67
00:05:12,569 --> 00:05:15,194
Good people who were
leaving you alone.

68
00:05:20,119 --> 00:05:24,135
You're the killer, Ana Lucia.

69
00:05:42,518 --> 00:05:45,631
I guess he decided to
start talking, huh?

70
00:05:54,632 --> 00:06:03,632
2x20:
Two for the Road

71
00:06:23,979 --> 00:06:26,556
Hey, Mike. Tequila and tonic.

72
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:28,360
Long day, huh?

73
00:06:31,315 --> 00:06:33,269
Good to see you again.

74
00:06:35,284 --> 00:06:38,721
You, uh,
"wanded" me at security.

75
00:06:41,844 --> 00:06:46,001
Another one, please.
So how does one get into "wanding"?

76
00:06:48,045 --> 00:06:50,287
One stops being a cop.

77
00:06:50,473 --> 00:06:53,864
What a coincidence.
I just stopped being a doctor.

78
00:06:56,094 --> 00:06:57,425
Why'd you quit?

79
00:06:57,565 --> 00:06:58,370
I didn't.

80
00:06:58,651 --> 00:07:03,718
My son ratted me out for
drinking on the job. Thank you.

81
00:07:04,514 --> 00:07:06,324
Lost my license.

82
00:07:06,698 --> 00:07:10,903
Hmm. Yeah, I know.
It's hilarious.

83
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:14,078
No, no. It's just that...

84
00:07:14,414 --> 00:07:17,893
I don't believe that parents and
their kids should work together.

85
00:07:18,125 --> 00:07:19,900
Too many issues.

86
00:07:20,122 --> 00:07:21,932
I'll drink to that.

87
00:07:26,011 --> 00:07:27,439
So where you headed?

88
00:07:27,625 --> 00:07:30,442
Sydney. Sydney, Australia.

89
00:07:32,205 --> 00:07:33,486
Want to come?

90
00:07:35,643 --> 00:07:37,452
I'm serious.

91
00:07:38,483 --> 00:07:40,916
Why would I go to
Sydney with you?

92
00:07:41,102 --> 00:07:43,602
Maybe fate has just thrown
the two of us together.

93
00:07:43,627 --> 00:07:46,874
You know,
like two drinks in an airport bar.

94
00:07:48,806 --> 00:07:51,180
Why would fate do that?

95
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:53,236
Oh, the same reason
fate does anything--

96
00:07:53,266 --> 00:07:56,416
so that we can help
each other out.

97
00:07:56,605 --> 00:07:59,042
You do need help, right?

98
00:08:00,956 --> 00:08:02,576
Unless you don't.

99
00:08:09,141 --> 00:08:11,689
What I'm doing down there
could be a little dangerous,

100
00:08:11,719 --> 00:08:14,433
and I need someone to protect me--
a bodyguard.

101
00:08:14,572 --> 00:08:18,922
It's perfect for someone
who stopped being a cop.

102
00:08:24,267 --> 00:08:26,413
I  don't even know your name.

103
00:08:26,552 --> 00:08:30,325
Oh, let's not use real names.
I tell you what--

104
00:08:30,476 --> 00:08:34,574
why don't you pick a name for me?
And then I'll pick one for you.

105
00:08:38,888 --> 00:08:40,507
You look like a Tom.

106
00:08:40,696 --> 00:08:44,898
Tom. What an excellent name.
And you should be a...

107
00:08:45,459 --> 00:08:46,502
Sarah.

108
00:08:52,505 --> 00:08:54,076
A ustralia.

109
00:09:14,057 --> 00:09:15,637
What happened?

110
00:09:16,986 --> 00:09:19,040
I cut myself shaving.

111
00:09:24,551 --> 00:09:27,900
The guy in the hatch
tried to kill me.

112
00:09:31,889 --> 00:09:33,451
You okay?

113
00:09:35,465 --> 00:09:37,257
I'm fine...

114
00:09:37,771 --> 00:09:39,629
but he won't be.

115
00:09:40,895 --> 00:09:43,087
- Hey, Ana?
- What?

116
00:09:45,008 --> 00:09:47,298
Don't do anything stupid.

117
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,984
If you've come to apologize,

118
00:10:23,069 --> 00:10:26,370
I forgive you for hitting
me with your crutch.

119
00:10:28,848 --> 00:10:32,095
I'm so glad my head
didn't break it.

120
00:10:33,032 --> 00:10:34,171
Why?

121
00:10:37,265 --> 00:10:39,969
Well, that's a broad question.

122
00:10:41,044 --> 00:10:43,955
Why did you try to hurt
Ana Lucia but not me?

123
00:10:46,393 --> 00:10:48,921
I'm not sure I know what
you're getting at, John.

124
00:10:49,063 --> 00:10:53,986
I was trapped under that
blast door... helpless.

125
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:57,196
You could have crushed my skull,
but you didn't do a thing.

126
00:10:57,935 --> 00:10:59,645
Why didn't you?

127
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,928
Because you're one of
the good ones, John.

128
00:11:04,252 --> 00:11:07,355
What? What? Good what?

129
00:11:08,703 --> 00:11:11,135
None of this matters.
I'm dead, anyway.

130
00:11:12,823 --> 00:11:15,255
The doctor's gone
to make a trade,

131
00:11:15,352 --> 00:11:18,731
and we both know he'll come
back empty-handed, and then...

132
00:11:19,472 --> 00:11:22,094
I've lost my value.

133
00:11:22,945 --> 00:11:25,177
So either Jack comes
back here and kills me,

134
00:11:25,318 --> 00:11:28,917
or my people find out where
I'm being held, and they do it.

135
00:11:29,086 --> 00:11:31,663
Why would your own
people want to kill you?

136
00:11:33,050 --> 00:11:35,771
Because the man in charge...

137
00:11:36,942 --> 00:11:41,348
He's a great man, John--
a brilliant man.

138
00:11:43,385 --> 00:11:46,263
But he is not a forgiving man.

139
00:11:47,832 --> 00:11:50,944
He'll kill me because
I failed, John.

140
00:11:51,663 --> 00:11:53,796
I failed my mission.

141
00:11:55,995 --> 00:11:57,518
What mission?

142
00:11:59,253 --> 00:12:02,882
When that woman caught
me in her trap,

143
00:12:03,538 --> 00:12:05,714
I was on my way here, John.

144
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,612
I was coming for you.

145
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:13,993
Locke!

146
00:12:16,003 --> 00:12:18,057
Locke, get out here!

147
00:12:18,946 --> 00:12:20,037
Locke!

148
00:12:21,962 --> 00:12:22,957
Locke!

149
00:12:23,951 --> 00:12:25,049
John!

150
00:12:49,059 --> 00:12:52,449
Hey, I've been knocking those
things down for 20 minutes.

151
00:12:52,589 --> 00:12:54,716
Get your hands
off my damn mango.

152
00:12:54,948 --> 00:12:57,238
Didn't figure you for
the fruit-picking type.

153
00:12:57,376 --> 00:12:59,191
What do you want?

154
00:12:59,749 --> 00:13:01,562
I need a gun.

155
00:13:02,606 --> 00:13:03,968
Well, here's an idea.

156
00:13:04,248 --> 00:13:07,162
Why not go to your buddy Jack?
He's got himself a gun.

157
00:13:07,393 --> 00:13:11,805
Oh, that's right. He's still
traipsin' around the jungle with Kate.

158
00:13:12,361 --> 00:13:15,887
If you've got a problem 'cause he's
making time with your girlfriend,

159
00:13:15,986 --> 00:13:18,605
don't take it out on me, man.

160
00:13:19,227 --> 00:13:21,549
How about you just
give me a gun?

161
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:25,920
Here's another idea-- scram.

162
00:13:27,795 --> 00:13:29,968
You heard me. Now git.

163
00:14:01,698 --> 00:14:02,790
Sarah.

164
00:14:06,947 --> 00:14:08,713
Sarah, open the damn door.

165
00:14:11,475 --> 00:14:12,998
Good, you're up.

166
00:14:13,841 --> 00:14:16,083
It's, uh, it's time.

167
00:14:16,225 --> 00:14:17,847
Protection duty.

168
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:20,591
Come on, let's go.

169
00:14:20,774 --> 00:14:23,395
After four days of drinking
and doing nothing,

170
00:14:23,534 --> 00:14:26,134
now, in the middle of the night,
you're ready to go?

171
00:14:26,153 --> 00:14:29,545
That's exactly right.
It's time. Come on.

172
00:14:30,105 --> 00:14:32,655
Fate's calling, Sarah.

173
00:14:45,686 --> 00:14:48,116
This is it.
Pull over right here.

174
00:14:51,823 --> 00:14:55,211
This is what you needed protection for--
the suburbs?

175
00:14:55,491 --> 00:14:57,353
Stay in the car.

176
00:14:57,495 --> 00:14:59,500
Should I keep the
meter running?

177
00:15:23,513 --> 00:15:24,884
Can I come in?

178
00:15:37,164 --> 00:15:40,748
Look, she's my daughter,
and I have every right to see her.

179
00:15:40,839 --> 00:15:43,082
No, you don't have a right!
Get out!

180
00:15:43,407 --> 00:15:47,182
I'm coming in here.
You can't stop me! She's my daughter!

181
00:15:47,322 --> 00:15:52,342
I pay the mortgage on this house!
I want to see my daughter!

182
00:15:52,482 --> 00:15:54,292
What the hell is
wrong with you?

183
00:15:54,486 --> 00:15:56,674
Don't you ever come back here!

184
00:15:57,001 --> 00:15:59,315
I was just having a
conversation with the lady.

185
00:15:59,345 --> 00:16:01,118
You need help!

186
00:16:19,293 --> 00:16:21,138
Dude, nice hole.

187
00:16:21,278 --> 00:16:22,571
What is it, Hurley?

188
00:16:23,638 --> 00:16:25,936
Hey, man,
you remember that radio we made?

189
00:16:26,488 --> 00:16:29,238
I was thinking maybe I could
get it to play some music.

190
00:16:29,639 --> 00:16:31,383
You know, for Libby.

191
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:35,045
Well, it worked only once,and
then just for a minute.

192
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:39,191
I've tried several times
since and only gotten static.

193
00:16:39,477 --> 00:16:42,600
Here's the thing.
Even that would be good.

194
00:16:42,761 --> 00:16:44,461
Because then,
Libby would be like,

195
00:16:44,756 --> 00:16:47,681
"it's the thought that counts,"
and I'll score major points,

196
00:16:47,711 --> 00:16:50,111
especially when she sees me
holding it over my head.

197
00:16:50,141 --> 00:16:54,111
And  why would you hold a
static-generating radio over your head?

198
00:16:54,864 --> 00:16:57,014
They didn't have "Say
Anything" in Baghdad?

199
00:16:57,146 --> 00:16:59,864
It's awesome.
This dude, like, gets this boom box,

200
00:16:59,972 --> 00:17:02,292
and he holds it over his head
outside this chick's window,

201
00:17:02,322 --> 00:17:06,574
and he plays some Peter Gabriel song
for her, and bam! The girl's, like, his.

202
00:17:06,716 --> 00:17:08,634
I mean, after her dad goes to jail.
But then he gets her!

203
00:17:08,664 --> 00:17:10,536
I  think I get the idea.

204
00:17:10,616 --> 00:17:12,584
You should really
check it out sometime.

205
00:17:12,614 --> 00:17:15,863
I mean, if we ever, you know,
get off this island.

206
00:17:18,533 --> 00:17:20,707
If you want to do
something nice for Libby,

207
00:17:20,856 --> 00:17:24,383
there's a beautiful beach
3 kilometers from here.

208
00:17:24,522 --> 00:17:26,100
You could take her there.

209
00:17:27,688 --> 00:17:29,546
You think she'd like that?

210
00:17:33,438 --> 00:17:35,535
I took Shannon there once.

211
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:43,304
Michael. Michael.

212
00:17:46,772 --> 00:17:48,150
So it worked?

213
00:17:48,966 --> 00:17:51,379
What are you
talking about, John?

214
00:17:51,754 --> 00:17:54,498
Your deal. The trade.

215
00:17:55,082 --> 00:17:58,100
- If they gave us Michael--
- They didn't give us anything.

216
00:17:59,027 --> 00:18:02,180
So it was just a coincidence
that he came wandering out?

217
00:18:02,273 --> 00:18:04,539
I was shouting.
He heard my voice.

218
00:18:07,702 --> 00:18:09,803
What? They just let Michael go,

219
00:18:09,891 --> 00:18:12,320
hoping that we would keep
up our end of the bargain?

220
00:18:12,350 --> 00:18:14,649
You think they're on
the honor system?

221
00:18:19,849 --> 00:18:23,246
- Hey.
- Hey.

222
00:18:43,398 --> 00:18:45,954
Come out, come out,
whoever you are.

223
00:18:49,402 --> 00:18:50,951
I know you're there.

224
00:18:53,996 --> 00:18:56,477
Don't make me come
in after you.

225
00:18:59,223 --> 00:19:00,219
Ahem!

226
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:07,349
Well, well, well.
What do we got here?

227
00:19:08,142 --> 00:19:12,827
Is little red riding hood gonna follow the
big bad wolf back to his stash o' guns?

228
00:19:13,583 --> 00:19:15,839
Why don't you give me
that one right there?

229
00:19:15,957 --> 00:19:18,512
I ain't gonna
gimme-you nothin'.

230
00:19:20,319 --> 00:19:22,173
We been through this, Lucy.

231
00:19:36,478 --> 00:19:39,343
What you gonna do
now, muchacha?

232
00:20:16,663 --> 00:20:19,019
We need some damn
music in here.

233
00:20:20,516 --> 00:20:22,839
- Who is she?
- Who is who?

234
00:20:23,119 --> 00:20:24,310
That woman.

235
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:27,319
She is a very long
story, Sarah.

236
00:20:28,625 --> 00:20:30,205
It's Ana Lucia.

237
00:20:31,610 --> 00:20:33,844
Well, I'm still Tom.

238
00:20:34,649 --> 00:20:36,545
You're pathetic,
that's what you are.

239
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:38,590
You bet your sweet ass I am.

240
00:20:44,644 --> 00:20:46,861
Why are you here?

241
00:20:49,112 --> 00:20:53,089
I'm here because I can't
apologize to my son.

242
00:20:54,274 --> 00:20:57,077
He tried to help me,
so I thanked him by cutting him off.

243
00:20:57,107 --> 00:20:59,254
I thanked him by hating him.

244
00:21:02,958 --> 00:21:08,935
You came here for the same reason I did,
kiddo. You ran away.

245
00:21:17,495 --> 00:21:22,468
My, my. Look what fate has
delivered up this time.

246
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:25,613
Come on.

247
00:21:25,970 --> 00:21:29,361
Let's go have a drink or ten
and be pathetic together.

248
00:21:29,548 --> 00:21:30,499
What do you say?

249
00:21:38,562 --> 00:21:39,658
No.

250
00:21:45,656 --> 00:21:46,555
No.

251
00:21:49,228 --> 00:21:50,799
That's your call.

252
00:21:53,988 --> 00:21:56,373
Hey! I'm walking here.

253
00:22:00,735 --> 00:22:01,946
Wait.

254
00:22:02,841 --> 00:22:03,959
Don't.

255
00:22:06,651 --> 00:22:09,442
Let's just get the
hell out of Sydney.

256
00:22:09,668 --> 00:22:12,517
Let's just go. Let's go back.

257
00:22:14,796 --> 00:22:17,476
I can't ever go back.

258
00:22:20,852 --> 00:22:22,590
See you, kiddo.

259
00:22:41,537 --> 00:22:42,437
What?

260
00:22:44,548 --> 00:22:47,580
Don't you want my phone number?

261
00:22:50,275 --> 00:22:52,491
You tell anyone about this...

262
00:22:53,897 --> 00:22:55,494
and I'll kill you.

263
00:22:58,541 --> 00:23:01,272
Guess  that takes
cuddling off the table.

264
00:23:16,225 --> 00:23:17,286
Hey there.

265
00:23:17,548 --> 00:23:19,428
- Oh!
- How's it going?

266
00:23:20,673 --> 00:23:22,398
This isn't what it looks like.

267
00:23:22,573 --> 00:23:25,235
And...what does it look like?

268
00:23:26,522 --> 00:23:29,500
It... looks like something...

269
00:23:30,368 --> 00:23:33,464
that... it's not.

270
00:23:36,314 --> 00:23:37,831
Oh, man.

271
00:23:38,375 --> 00:23:39,699
I'm so busted.

272
00:23:40,035 --> 00:23:44,067
Hurley, I'm not here to tell
you how to act around food.

273
00:23:44,870 --> 00:23:46,873
No, I'm not busted for that.

274
00:23:47,028 --> 00:23:51,162
I'm busted for...
something else.

275
00:23:53,552 --> 00:23:57,147
I was packing a picnic,
'cause I was kinda hoping that

276
00:23:57,379 --> 00:23:59,552
you'd wanna go with me.

277
00:23:59,747 --> 00:24:02,616
You know, as an "us" thing.

278
00:24:03,153 --> 00:24:06,470
But it was a surprise.

279
00:24:08,955 --> 00:24:09,929
Really?

280
00:24:14,377 --> 00:24:16,023
That's very sweet.

281
00:24:20,530 --> 00:24:24,313
- So, do you wanna go?
- Where to?

282
00:24:25,316 --> 00:24:27,383
Can that part still
be a surprise?

283
00:24:43,662 --> 00:24:46,907
- Hey, you're back.
- Hey.

284
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:51,829
So, the others--
they didn't show up?

285
00:24:52,090 --> 00:24:52,704
No.

286
00:24:53,842 --> 00:24:55,732
Michael's back, though.

287
00:24:58,780 --> 00:25:00,592
What happened here?

288
00:25:00,824 --> 00:25:01,629
My fault.

289
00:25:02,010 --> 00:25:03,960
I left the tap on in
the bathroom sink,

290
00:25:04,001 --> 00:25:06,628
and Ana wiped out and hit
her head on the counter.

291
00:25:06,788 --> 00:25:08,410
And I'm sorry-- again.

292
00:25:11,219 --> 00:25:13,556
Yeah, don't worry about it.

293
00:25:13,722 --> 00:25:16,635
Jack. Jack.

294
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:19,586
I think he's waking up.

295
00:25:20,550 --> 00:25:23,874
Michael. Hey, Michael.

296
00:25:24,878 --> 00:25:26,114
Hey... Jack?

297
00:25:27,284 --> 00:25:28,542
Hey, man.

298
00:25:28,753 --> 00:25:30,090
Man... where...

299
00:25:30,681 --> 00:25:32,572
- How did I get...
- Oh, wait.

300
00:25:32,692 --> 00:25:35,292
Try to take it easy, okay?
You're back in the hatch.

301
00:25:35,311 --> 00:25:37,538
We found you out in
the jungle last night.

302
00:25:37,832 --> 00:25:39,739
Oh, my head.

303
00:25:42,062 --> 00:25:43,466
Welcome back.

304
00:25:45,532 --> 00:25:46,698
Hey, John.

305
00:25:52,397 --> 00:25:53,738
I found them.

306
00:25:59,284 --> 00:26:01,103
After I left,

307
00:26:02,338 --> 00:26:04,870
I hiked north,
back to where we were.

308
00:26:06,979 --> 00:26:10,038
Hiked to the beach,
followed the shoreline.

309
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:13,834
A day later, I saw one.

310
00:26:14,786 --> 00:26:16,661
What did he look like?

311
00:26:16,784 --> 00:26:21,921
Dirty. Worn clothing,
no shoes. Simple--

312
00:26:22,039 --> 00:26:24,298
just like the rest of them.

313
00:26:24,889 --> 00:26:27,343
- Like the rest of them?
- Yeah.

314
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:33,318
His people, the others.
I followed him back to his camp.

315
00:26:33,856 --> 00:26:39,310
They live in tents-- canvas
tents and teepees.

316
00:26:39,473 --> 00:26:42,659
They eat dried fish.
They're worse off than we are.

317
00:26:43,166 --> 00:26:46,650
- How many of them were there?
- I counted 22.

318
00:26:46,790 --> 00:26:49,081
- And, uh, the boat...
- I didn't see it.

319
00:26:49,321 --> 00:26:52,834
Did... did you see Walt?

320
00:26:54,815 --> 00:26:55,962
No.

321
00:26:57,854 --> 00:26:59,559
But I know he's there.

322
00:26:59,701 --> 00:27:01,466
What about everyone
else they took?

323
00:27:01,633 --> 00:27:04,624
Cindy? Did you see
any other kids?

324
00:27:05,044 --> 00:27:08,900
No, no, no kids.

325
00:27:09,042 --> 00:27:12,271
No, but I think they were in
the same place as my boy.

326
00:27:12,505 --> 00:27:14,316
They have a hatch.

327
00:27:15,506 --> 00:27:16,797
How do you know that they--

328
00:27:16,827 --> 00:27:20,550
There's set of metal doors leading
underground. What else could it be?

329
00:27:20,635 --> 00:27:22,888
And you think that that's
where they're keeping the kids?

330
00:27:22,918 --> 00:27:24,538
They keep it guarded 24/7.

331
00:27:24,692 --> 00:27:29,429
2 guards, 2 guns, and two guns is
all I saw. They're barely armed.

332
00:27:29,551 --> 00:27:32,031
Most of them are old,
and half of them are women.

333
00:27:35,548 --> 00:27:36,976
I wanted...

334
00:27:43,634 --> 00:27:45,217
I couldn't save him.

335
00:27:46,611 --> 00:27:48,854
So I came back to tell you...

336
00:27:50,709 --> 00:27:53,138
tell you that we can take them.

337
00:27:55,703 --> 00:28:00,426
As  soon as I get my strength back,
I will take us back there.

338
00:28:00,826 --> 00:28:03,150
And we are gonna get
my boy back.

339
00:28:23,959 --> 00:28:25,659
You were right.

340
00:28:28,864 --> 00:28:30,770
Right about what?

341
00:28:31,012 --> 00:28:32,570
About Henry.

342
00:28:34,237 --> 00:28:37,111
What you and Sayid did to
him when you first found him.

343
00:28:37,362 --> 00:28:40,106
You were...you were right.

344
00:28:41,309 --> 00:28:42,990
I don't like how you did it,

345
00:28:43,306 --> 00:28:46,491
but I shouldn't have
gotten in your way.

346
00:28:48,250 --> 00:28:53,643
Well, you did what you thought was
right at the time you thought it, Jack.

347
00:28:55,068 --> 00:28:59,176
I just hope the next time you decide
to do something, you include me.

348
00:29:00,247 --> 00:29:04,312
And something tells me...
that's gonna be soon.

349
00:29:06,656 --> 00:29:10,667
You heard Michael.
We can take them.

350
00:29:10,818 --> 00:29:13,541
Our friend with the beard told
us not to cross the line.

351
00:29:13,571 --> 00:29:15,648
These people are liars, John.

352
00:29:15,822 --> 00:29:18,372
Why the hell should we take
their word on anything?

353
00:29:19,742 --> 00:29:21,880
I couldn't agree more.

354
00:29:22,688 --> 00:29:23,670
So...

355
00:29:25,717 --> 00:29:27,131
now what?

356
00:29:30,508 --> 00:29:32,053
Where are you going?

357
00:29:32,345 --> 00:29:34,644
Get our guns back from Sawyer.

358
00:29:34,796 --> 00:29:36,934
We're gonna need you
to help convince him.

359
00:29:37,295 --> 00:29:38,945
Who's gonna take
care of Michael?

360
00:29:38,958 --> 00:29:41,617
I'll stay. You guys go ahead.

361
00:29:41,910 --> 00:29:44,839
- You sure?
- Give Sawyer my best.

362
00:29:45,382 --> 00:29:48,151
All right. We'll be back soon.

363
00:29:57,064 --> 00:29:59,698
Watch your head. Almost there.

364
00:29:59,881 --> 00:30:01,775
You ever watch
"The Flintstones"?

365
00:30:01,967 --> 00:30:05,317
Sure. I used to watch it all the
time when I was in the hospital...

366
00:30:06,011 --> 00:30:09,119
when I... broke my hip.

367
00:30:09,395 --> 00:30:14,003
Did you ever notice how Fred would run
by the same thing over and over again?

368
00:30:14,125 --> 00:30:16,321
Third time past this tree.

369
00:30:19,030 --> 00:30:22,048
Uh, that's a different tree.

370
00:30:22,728 --> 00:30:25,282
Hurley, it's okay
if you're lost.

371
00:30:25,449 --> 00:30:28,094
Dude, I'm not lost.
Will you trust me?

372
00:30:28,281 --> 00:30:33,769
We're right about to walk onto the most
excellent secret beach on the island.

373
00:30:33,873 --> 00:30:36,035
And... surprise!

374
00:30:38,234 --> 00:30:41,343
Uh... Hurley?

375
00:30:41,498 --> 00:30:43,582
This is our beach.

376
00:30:43,927 --> 00:30:45,237
There's Jin.

377
00:30:52,237 --> 00:30:55,549
Hey, I tell you what.
Why not have the picnic here?

378
00:30:55,625 --> 00:30:57,661
Come on, give me the blankets.

379
00:30:58,223 --> 00:30:59,713
Blankets?

380
00:31:00,636 --> 00:31:02,879
You don't have any blankets?

381
00:31:04,189 --> 00:31:06,356
How about drinks?

382
00:31:09,195 --> 00:31:12,306
Okay, I tell you what.
I will handle the blankets.

383
00:31:12,555 --> 00:31:14,306
You just track down
Rose and Bernard.

384
00:31:14,336 --> 00:31:17,009
I saw them pull wine
from the pallet. Okay?

385
00:31:17,435 --> 00:31:19,911
Oh. Wine.

386
00:31:22,007 --> 00:31:23,186
Groovy.

387
00:31:24,421 --> 00:31:28,365
Hey, maybe if I get drunk enough,
I'll remember where I know you from.

388
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:30,926
Yeah.

389
00:31:31,738 --> 00:31:32,485
Okay.

390
00:31:49,371 --> 00:31:50,318
Sawyer.

391
00:31:52,158 --> 00:31:53,564
Put the book down.

392
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:55,638
It's not a book.
It's a manuscript.

393
00:31:55,758 --> 00:31:58,908
I'm about to be the first and
only guy to find out who done it.

394
00:31:59,898 --> 00:32:01,797
I think I got it figured out,

395
00:32:01,967 --> 00:32:04,671
so cool your damn jets and
walk around the coconut trees.

396
00:32:04,701 --> 00:32:06,525
I got, like,
ten pages left-- Hey!

397
00:32:08,293 --> 00:32:09,623
Wanna figure it out?

398
00:32:12,907 --> 00:32:13,676
Aah!

399
00:32:16,359 --> 00:32:18,189
What the hell is
your problem, doc?

400
00:32:18,467 --> 00:32:20,217
It's time to give
us the guns back.

401
00:32:21,071 --> 00:32:22,827
You burn the ending
of my book and now--

402
00:32:22,857 --> 00:32:25,581
- Where are they, James?
- You too, Brutus?

403
00:32:25,857 --> 00:32:28,807
Just take us there, Sawyer, all right?
Quit playing around.

404
00:32:28,862 --> 00:32:31,362
What, did you bring her
along for a sympathy vote?

405
00:32:31,514 --> 00:32:32,842
She ain't in my head, doc.

406
00:32:33,045 --> 00:32:35,717
So why don't you two just
go play in the jungle?

407
00:32:35,964 --> 00:32:38,503
Take us to the guns. Now.

408
00:32:44,672 --> 00:32:46,588
Oh, that bitch.

409
00:32:47,628 --> 00:32:50,985
She stole my damn gun.
Ana Lucia.

410
00:32:52,356 --> 00:32:55,413
- Why would she need a gun?
- Son of a bitch.

411
00:32:58,290 --> 00:32:59,465
Jack...

412
00:33:03,494 --> 00:33:05,735
I need to tell you something.

413
00:33:15,351 --> 00:33:16,885
Pick it up.

414
00:33:22,785 --> 00:33:24,508
Cut yourself loose.

415
00:33:25,668 --> 00:33:26,628
What?

416
00:33:27,696 --> 00:33:29,127
Just do it.

417
00:33:31,839 --> 00:33:32,707
Why?

418
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:35,879
You know why.

419
00:33:59,572 --> 00:34:02,491
He kept saying you
were misunderstood.

420
00:34:02,678 --> 00:34:06,272
- What are you talking about?
- Goodwin.

421
00:34:09,121 --> 00:34:12,341
Yes, he told us all
about you, Ana--

422
00:34:12,555 --> 00:34:16,707
How he thought you were worthy
and that he could change you.

423
00:34:21,250 --> 00:34:23,782
But he was wrong...

424
00:34:32,326 --> 00:34:35,050
and it cost him his life.

425
00:34:36,754 --> 00:34:38,737
He was gonna kill me.

426
00:34:47,646 --> 00:34:49,300
Was he?

427
00:34:55,083 --> 00:34:57,105
Are you done?

428
00:34:59,108 --> 00:35:01,460
Yes, Ana, I'm done.

429
00:35:10,451 --> 00:35:12,410
So this is it, huh?

430
00:35:14,372 --> 00:35:18,366
Yes, Henry. This is it.

431
00:35:23,467 --> 00:35:25,567
I want you to listen to me, okay?

432
00:35:25,968 --> 00:35:28,268
Because I'm asking you a favor, Chrissy.

433
00:35:29,294 --> 00:35:31,024
I'm standing in front of you in

434
00:35:31,149 --> 00:35:33,642
the same suit that I'm
wearing to my father's funeral,

435
00:35:33,672 --> 00:35:35,290
and I'm asking you a favor.

436
00:35:35,475 --> 00:35:37,977
In 16 hours,
I need to land at L.A.X.,

437
00:35:38,356 --> 00:35:40,356
And I need that coffin
to clear customs,

438
00:35:40,452 --> 00:35:42,948
because there's going to
be a hearse waiting there.

439
00:35:42,978 --> 00:35:47,278
And I need that hearse to take me
and that coffin to a cemetery. Why?

440
00:35:47,372 --> 00:35:50,102
Chrissy, why can't I just
bring him to a funeral home

441
00:35:50,288 --> 00:35:53,255
and make all the arrangements?
Why can't I really take my time with it?

442
00:35:53,285 --> 00:35:57,362
Because... because I
need it to be done.

443
00:35:58,002 --> 00:35:59,987
I need it to be over.

444
00:36:02,749 --> 00:36:04,630
I just...

445
00:36:05,312 --> 00:36:07,630
I need to bury my father.

446
00:36:17,990 --> 00:36:19,892
That was an airplane.

447
00:36:20,622 --> 00:36:23,636
No, I'm not at work.
I'm in Sydney.

448
00:36:24,427 --> 00:36:26,879
That's right, Australia.

449
00:36:29,321 --> 00:36:31,060
I...

450
00:36:33,423 --> 00:36:35,617
I don't know, I...

451
00:36:41,507 --> 00:36:44,202
I made a mistake, mom.

452
00:36:47,180 --> 00:36:51,316
You knew, so I got as far
away from you as I could.

453
00:36:56,917 --> 00:36:59,041
But now...

454
00:37:01,032 --> 00:37:03,844
I want to come home, mom.

455
00:37:08,069 --> 00:37:10,073
So come home.

456
00:37:11,927 --> 00:37:19,191
- What flight are you on?
- I'm on Oceanic flight 815.

457
00:37:21,757 --> 00:37:24,713
I'll be there when
you land, mija.

458
00:37:45,391 --> 00:37:47,339
Where is everybody?

459
00:37:47,726 --> 00:37:50,126
What you said got
'em worked up.

460
00:37:50,244 --> 00:37:53,477
They went to get all the
guns back from Sawyer.

461
00:37:53,582 --> 00:37:55,281
Sawyer.

462
00:37:57,267 --> 00:37:59,922
Sawyer has all the guns.

463
00:38:01,375 --> 00:38:03,411
Long story.

464
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:08,454
At least he didn't
get that one.

465
00:38:10,394 --> 00:38:11,628
Yeah.

466
00:38:12,962 --> 00:38:18,247
- Too bad I can't use it.
- Use it on what?

467
00:38:19,208 --> 00:38:23,362
We caught one of them--
the others.

468
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:26,308
He's locked up in there.

469
00:38:28,549 --> 00:38:31,308
- How long has he...
- Over a week.

470
00:38:32,601 --> 00:38:35,026
And you're what,
taking care of him?

471
00:38:36,014 --> 00:38:38,251
He tried to kill me today.

472
00:38:41,975 --> 00:38:44,517
So I wanted him dead.

473
00:38:56,351 --> 00:38:57,990
I couldn't do it.

474
00:39:00,044 --> 00:39:01,988
I couldn't even kill him.

475
00:39:07,951 --> 00:39:10,421
I looked at him, and he...

476
00:39:17,267 --> 00:39:19,512
I can't do this anymore.

477
00:39:32,894 --> 00:39:34,733
Then let me do it.

478
00:39:40,293 --> 00:39:42,256
They're animals.

479
00:39:42,918 --> 00:39:47,301
I've seen these people,
and they are animals.

480
00:39:48,519 --> 00:39:52,588
They took my son right out of my hands.
They took my son and...

481
00:39:56,259 --> 00:39:59,841
I'll do it. Give me the gun.
I'll kill him.

482
00:40:03,855 --> 00:40:06,527
'Cause that's what they'd do.

483
00:40:12,970 --> 00:40:14,829
What's the combination?

484
00:40:20,501 --> 00:40:21,977
18 right...

485
00:40:24,602 --> 00:40:26,204
1 left...

486
00:40:27,344 --> 00:40:28,820
31 right.

487
00:40:47,314 --> 00:40:49,203
I'm sorry.

488
00:40:50,419 --> 00:40:52,118
For what?

489
00:41:18,448 --> 00:41:19,483
Michael?

490
