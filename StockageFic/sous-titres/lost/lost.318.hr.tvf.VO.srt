<i>Previously on</i> Lost...

2
00:00:02,276 --> 00:00:03,290
Is that an helicopter?

3
00:00:03,392 --> 00:00:05,065
It's how an helicopter suppose to sound?

4
00:00:05,984 --> 00:00:06,984
Get away from her!

5
00:00:09,086 --> 00:00:10,086
Desmond.

6
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:15,696
- What's wrong?
- What's wrong is I'm married.

7
00:00:15,898 --> 00:00:16,898
Right.

8
00:00:32,558 --> 00:00:33,626
You're pregnant.

9
00:01:05,494 --> 00:01:06,517
Good morning, Jack.

10
00:01:07,496 --> 00:01:08,553
You need a hand?

11
00:01:09,746 --> 00:01:10,746
Thank you.

12
00:01:18,086 --> 00:01:19,825
I came by your tent earlier.

13
00:01:21,183 --> 00:01:22,183
Is Jin gone?

14
00:01:23,897 --> 00:01:26,340
He went off with Charlie,
Hurley and Desmond.

15
00:01:27,059 --> 00:01:28,059
Did you need him?

16
00:01:28,744 --> 00:01:30,521
Actually, I was looking for you.

17
00:01:30,777 --> 00:01:33,998
I wanted to see how you were doing
with your pregnancy.

18
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:37,748
I'm doing fine.

19
00:01:38,758 --> 00:01:41,035
A little tired, but that's normal,
right?

20
00:01:41,192 --> 00:01:42,192
Sure.

21
00:01:43,223 --> 00:01:44,389
Any morning sickness?

22
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:45,720
Not anymore.

23
00:01:46,823 --> 00:01:47,907
Any bleeding?

24
00:01:52,408 --> 00:01:55,074
Why are you asking me
all these questions, Jack?

25
00:01:56,667 --> 00:01:57,814
I'm just checking in.

26
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:00,788
I mean, now that I'm back, I just...

27
00:02:00,922 --> 00:02:03,236
wanted to make sure
that you were doing okay.

28
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:05,470
Thank you.

29
00:02:06,283 --> 00:02:07,283
I'm okay.

30
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:09,220
Great.

31
00:04:38,387 --> 00:04:40,041
- Who is she?
- I have no idea.

32
00:04:40,282 --> 00:04:42,862
She seems to know you, dude.
She just said your name.

33
00:04:43,293 --> 00:04:45,224
I've never seen her before in my life.

34
00:04:47,429 --> 00:04:48,471
She's waking up.

35
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:54,196
She's trying to talk.
We should get her some water.

36
00:04:55,281 --> 00:04:56,392
Hey, give me a hand.

37
00:05:01,643 --> 00:05:03,404
- What's she saying?
- I don't know.

38
00:05:04,538 --> 00:05:07,424
- Spanish, dude.
- What, do you understand her, then?

39
00:05:11,784 --> 00:05:12,950
She says she's dying.

40
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:20,385
My God!

41
00:05:20,487 --> 00:05:22,957
It's a branch!
She must have hit it on the way down.

42
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:26,288
Get her pack. We haven't got much
in this first aid kit.

43
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:28,082
See if there's anything
we can use in it.

44
00:05:28,184 --> 00:05:30,719
What if this is a rescue?
What if she came for us?

45
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:31,944
Is she gonna be okay?

46
00:05:32,076 --> 00:05:34,373
- We can't let her...
- Just go and start looking!

47
00:05:37,979 --> 00:05:39,097
We get Jack.

48
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:41,250
We have to get her to Jack
as soon as possible.

49
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:44,294
- She could be our way off the island.
- If we move her, it'll be worse.

50
00:05:44,396 --> 00:05:45,673
We just let her bleed to death?

51
00:05:46,032 --> 00:05:47,495
No, we need to bring Jack here.

52
00:05:47,597 --> 00:05:49,012
It's an 8-hour walk one way!

53
00:05:49,982 --> 00:05:51,053
Then I'll run.

54
00:05:51,706 --> 00:05:53,666
You're out of your mind. It's not safe.

55
00:05:53,823 --> 00:05:56,252
It's gonna be dark soon.
Who knows who's out in this jungle?

56
00:05:56,354 --> 00:05:58,690
In case you have forgotten,
there're people on this island

57
00:05:58,803 --> 00:06:00,761
- trying to kill us!
- Nobody knows we're here!

58

59
00:08:07,624 --> 00:08:08,658
How's this?

60
00:08:09,419 --> 00:08:10,537
That's perfect.

61
00:08:11,227 --> 00:08:12,227
Thank you.

62
00:08:19,297 --> 00:08:20,979
What do you think happened to Jack

63
00:08:21,161 --> 00:08:22,602
while he was with the others?

64
00:08:24,161 --> 00:08:27,015
Since he's been back,
he seems different.

65
00:08:29,162 --> 00:08:31,715
He says that he was pretty much
a prisoner,

66
00:08:32,067 --> 00:08:34,079
and the only reason
why he cooperated is 'cause

67
00:08:34,278 --> 00:08:36,184
he thought
they'd let him off the island.

68
00:08:37,524 --> 00:08:38,654
Do you believe him?

69
00:08:41,352 --> 00:08:42,352
Why wouldn't I?

70
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:47,613
He came to me,
asking about my pregnancy.

71
00:08:48,787 --> 00:08:51,121
- What would that have anything to do...
- What if...

72
00:08:52,225 --> 00:08:54,005
What if the others want my baby?

73
00:08:55,226 --> 00:08:57,226
He's been there alone for over a week.

74
00:08:57,727 --> 00:09:00,060
How do we know
he isn't working with them?

75
00:09:04,665 --> 00:09:06,165
He's not working with them.

76
00:09:09,037 --> 00:09:10,592
Do you know something, Kate?

77
00:09:20,133 --> 00:09:21,224
It's Juliet.

78
00:09:22,226 --> 00:09:25,185
She was their doctor... their...
Their fertility doctor,

79
00:09:25,287 --> 00:09:26,620
studying pregnant women,

80
00:09:27,085 --> 00:09:29,446
and when Claire was sick,
she told me and Jack...

81
00:09:30,911 --> 00:09:33,133
The reason the Others
wanted her baby...

82
00:09:33,850 --> 00:09:34,941
was for research.

83
00:09:43,785 --> 00:09:45,926
- Wait. You don't have to do this.
- Go away, Kate.

84
00:09:48,977 --> 00:09:50,921
I want to know about your research.

85
00:09:53,037 --> 00:09:54,759
What happens to pregnant women?

86
00:09:56,663 --> 00:09:57,788
You're pregnant.

87
00:09:59,161 --> 00:10:00,827
Are you sure? How do you know?

88
00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:02,687
I asked you a question.

89
00:10:03,130 --> 00:10:04,484
Everyone else might be all right

90
00:10:04,586 --> 00:10:06,980
with you washing your clothes
and eating our food,

91
00:10:07,165 --> 00:10:09,109
but I want to know what's going on.

92
00:10:09,539 --> 00:10:10,675
I want answers.

93
00:10:12,663 --> 00:10:15,718
What are you people doing?
Why are you taking children?

94
00:10:18,287 --> 00:10:20,898
What happens to pregnant women
on this island?

95
00:10:22,767 --> 00:10:24,302
- What happens... - They die.

96
00:10:27,036 --> 00:10:28,036
They all die.

97
00:10:31,849 --> 00:10:33,126
Sun, come on. Let's go.

98
00:10:44,122 --> 00:10:45,224
What is she saying?

99
00:10:45,326 --> 00:10:47,456
Chinese... not Korean.

100
00:10:47,615 --> 00:10:49,042
Maybe we should just pull it out.

101
00:10:49,322 --> 00:10:51,650
- You'll just make it worse.
- You forgot what's at stake?

102
00:10:51,782 --> 00:10:53,172
Or is this another of your flashes?

103
00:10:53,274 --> 00:10:54,651
Who's getting an arrow in the neck?

104
00:10:54,782 --> 00:10:57,027
Unless you forget,
she said my bloody name!

105
00:10:59,147 --> 00:11:01,438
She had a photo of me
and my girlfriend!

106
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:04,628
Do I understand?
I understand better than all of you!

107
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:06,715
Hey, guys, chill.

108
00:11:06,817 --> 00:11:08,749
We've wasted enough time already.

109
00:11:09,604 --> 00:11:10,945
Hey, you're not leaving us.

110
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:12,783
Just get out of my way, Charlie.

111
00:12:33,677 --> 00:12:34,677
Who are you?

112
00:12:36,618 --> 00:12:38,088
I said, who are you?

113
00:12:40,678 --> 00:12:42,333
He's the guy who shot Sayid.

114
00:12:43,105 --> 00:12:45,843
Kate told us he lived out
in that station that Locke blew up.

115
00:12:46,865 --> 00:12:47,888
He's an Other.

116
00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:50,780
I thought Locke killed that guy
with the electro-fence thingy.

117
00:12:52,115 --> 00:12:55,502
You've got five seconds to talk,
or I fire this gun, brother.

118
00:12:57,954 --> 00:12:59,011
That's a flare gun.

119
00:12:59,113 --> 00:13:00,863
And how do you think it'll feel...

120
00:13:01,179 --> 00:13:03,725
Taking a flare to the chest
at this range?

121
00:13:05,445 --> 00:13:08,397
As your friend pointed out,
I already died once this week.

122
00:13:16,534 --> 00:13:17,692
You understand her.

123
00:13:17,908 --> 00:13:19,185
She's speaking Italian.

124
00:13:19,722 --> 00:13:21,777
She said she's dying. She needs help.

125
00:13:24,222 --> 00:13:27,461
I was a soviet army field medic.
I can offer you my services.

126
00:13:29,158 --> 00:13:31,239
- Wait. What are you doing?
- I'm saving her.

127
00:13:40,017 --> 00:13:41,926
This branch has punctured her lung.

128
00:13:42,348 --> 00:13:43,681
It's filling with blood.

129
00:13:43,909 --> 00:13:46,418
If it is not ventilated soon,
she's going to die.

130
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:52,418
Well, do it. Help her.

131
00:13:52,533 --> 00:13:53,533
If I fix her,

132
00:13:54,158 --> 00:13:56,794
you must let me walk away
as if I never came upon you.

133
00:14:05,723 --> 00:14:06,723
What do you need?

134
00:17:58,951 --> 00:18:01,542
Be quiet. Don't move.

135
00:18:03,121 --> 00:18:06,168
You want me to help you and your baby?
I have answers to your questions,

136
00:18:06,311 --> 00:18:08,339
but you have to come with me right now.

137
00:18:08,722 --> 00:18:10,754
Just you and me, nobody else.

138
00:18:18,534 --> 00:18:21,675
If what you said was true,
that means I'm already dead.

139
00:18:22,656 --> 00:18:24,240
Why should I go anywhere with you?

140
00:18:24,376 --> 00:18:26,458
Because there may be hope for you yet.

141
00:18:52,505 --> 00:18:53,560
Where are we going?

142
00:18:54,459 --> 00:18:57,663
There's a medical station near here.
They have an ultrasound machine.

143
00:18:58,135 --> 00:19:00,412
Claire and Kate
told me about that place.

144
00:19:01,698 --> 00:19:02,698
It was abandoned.

145
00:19:03,145 --> 00:19:04,247
They found nothing there.

146
00:19:04,377 --> 00:19:06,860
Well, that's because
they didn't know where to look.

147
00:19:07,761 --> 00:19:09,483
What are you going to do to me?

148
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:16,078
I'm gonna look at your baby
and determine the D.O.C....

149
00:19:17,338 --> 00:19:18,668
Date of conception.

150
00:19:18,889 --> 00:19:20,910
The ultrasound will tell me
when you got pregnant,

151
00:19:21,029 --> 00:19:22,066
give or take a day.

152
00:19:22,216 --> 00:19:23,625
If you got pregnant off the island,

153
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:26,572
then you and your baby
will probably be okay,

154
00:19:27,638 --> 00:19:29,360
but if you got pregnant here...

155
00:19:32,936 --> 00:19:35,460
We'll cross that bridge
when we come to it.

156
00:19:36,388 --> 00:19:39,276
When was the last time
you and your husband had sex?

157
00:19:39,533 --> 00:19:41,036
I would rather not talk about that.

158
00:19:41,137 --> 00:19:42,847
Look, I know that it's personal,

159
00:19:42,938 --> 00:19:44,547
but if I know when,
then I can figure...

160
00:19:44,641 --> 00:19:46,630
Isn't that what the machine will do?

161
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:51,033
Then let's keep walking.

162
00:22:56,623 --> 00:22:58,257
What else do you know
about this woman?

163
00:22:58,445 --> 00:23:00,614
Did she have anything on her
besides the flare gun?

164
00:23:00,763 --> 00:23:03,619
Just a book,
a fancy radio/phone thingy...

165
00:23:06,262 --> 00:23:07,262
Does it work?

166
00:23:09,072 --> 00:23:10,072
Like I'd tell you.

167
00:23:11,572 --> 00:23:12,738
One of you must help.

168
00:23:13,136 --> 00:23:15,247
The rest, clear the way.
I need space.

169
00:23:15,772 --> 00:23:16,886
I'll do it.

170
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:21,869
Wipe away as much of the blood
as you can.

171
00:23:22,423 --> 00:23:24,230
We need to evacuate the air now!

172
00:23:25,698 --> 00:23:26,698
Hold her steady.

173
00:23:27,699 --> 00:23:29,496
- Steady!
- I heard you.

174
00:23:34,971 --> 00:23:36,653
Is that... normal?

175
00:23:44,291 --> 00:23:45,393
Gauze.

176
00:23:48,748 --> 00:23:50,771
Tape it. Be careful.

177
00:23:51,210 --> 00:23:53,065
The covering needs to be hollow.

178
00:23:53,798 --> 00:23:55,298
The wound needs to breathe.

179
00:24:03,285 --> 00:24:04,421
What did she say?

180
00:24:05,484 --> 00:24:06,484
"Thank you."

181
00:24:07,861 --> 00:24:09,672
She said,
"thank you for helping me."

182
00:24:21,487 --> 00:24:22,726
It's right down here.

183
00:25:20,796 --> 00:25:22,073
Why are you doing this?

184
00:25:23,362 --> 00:25:24,362
What?

185
00:25:25,485 --> 00:25:26,485
Helping me.

186
00:25:37,109 --> 00:25:38,189
Once upon a time,

187
00:25:39,715 --> 00:25:42,396
I told women that they were pregnant,

188
00:25:43,422 --> 00:25:44,786
and their faces...

189
00:25:47,166 --> 00:25:48,609
it was the best news

190
00:25:49,298 --> 00:25:51,713
they ever got
in their entire life.

191
00:25:54,047 --> 00:25:55,342
Then I came here.

192
00:25:59,049 --> 00:26:00,049
I've lost...

193
00:26:02,298 --> 00:26:06,195
nine patients in the last three years.

194
00:26:10,363 --> 00:26:12,696
I'm helping you
because I want to tell you

195
00:26:13,046 --> 00:26:16,379
that you and your husband got
pregnant before you came here.

196
00:26:21,362 --> 00:26:24,417
I'm helping you because
I want to give good news again.

197
00:26:31,236 --> 00:26:32,736
I slept with another man...

198
00:26:37,664 --> 00:26:39,351
...before we got to the island.

199
00:26:43,546 --> 00:26:45,101
Jin and I, we were having...

200
00:26:48,173 --> 00:26:49,173
trouble.

201
00:26:49,362 --> 00:26:50,362
We weren't...

202
00:26:55,796 --> 00:26:56,851
and I had a friend.

203
00:27:06,362 --> 00:27:07,362
It was a mistake.

204
00:27:08,358 --> 00:27:09,691
We all make mistakes.

205
00:27:15,392 --> 00:27:16,483
Which way?

206
00:27:51,333 --> 00:27:53,208
Will you help me move this forward?

207
00:27:58,270 --> 00:27:59,338
Good.

208
00:28:27,167 --> 00:28:28,553
Why is this room hidden?

209
00:28:31,596 --> 00:28:32,838
Don't worry about it.

210
00:28:33,546 --> 00:28:34,601
What is this place?

211
00:28:37,417 --> 00:28:38,485
Tell me!

212
00:28:41,486 --> 00:28:43,558
It's where we brought
the women to die.

213
00:28:49,056 --> 00:28:50,056
She's fine.

214
00:28:50,819 --> 00:28:52,627
Keep the wound as clean as you can.

215
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,587
She should be better in a day.

216
00:28:56,350 --> 00:28:58,657
A day?
Her lung was punctured.

217
00:29:00,473 --> 00:29:03,028
On this island,
the rules are a bit different.

218
00:29:03,787 --> 00:29:05,064
Maybe a day and a half.

219
00:29:10,663 --> 00:29:11,774
I did as I promised.

220
00:29:13,036 --> 00:29:14,036
She will live.

221
00:29:15,038 --> 00:29:17,599
- You can't seriously considering...
- Just go.

222
00:29:19,963 --> 00:29:21,368
Are you kidding?
He's one of them!

223
00:29:21,413 --> 00:29:22,944
So what would you
have me do, Charlie?

224
00:29:22,953 --> 00:29:24,737
We've got to make a stretcher
and carry her.

225
00:29:24,756 --> 00:29:26,634
How are we gonna do that
and bring a prisoner?

226
00:29:26,752 --> 00:29:28,595
Give me some rope.
I'll take responsibility.

227
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:30,642
Phone. Phone!

228
00:29:31,698 --> 00:29:32,912
Wait, Jin!

229
00:29:33,163 --> 00:29:34,684
- Jin, it's all right!
- No, let him!

230
00:29:35,041 --> 00:29:36,371
- Come back here!
- Let him!

231
00:29:38,832 --> 00:29:40,362
Jin, it's all right! Jin!

232
00:29:41,052 --> 00:29:42,751
Let him go.
Jin, let him go!

233
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,052
Phone!

234
00:29:52,974 --> 00:29:53,974
You stole this?

235
00:29:54,077 --> 00:29:56,225
How could you respect me
if I didn't try?

236
00:29:56,347 --> 00:29:59,458
How about I take your other eye?
Would you respect that?

237
00:29:59,982 --> 00:30:01,504
Sorry. I...

238
00:30:02,296 --> 00:30:03,305
Charlie, don't!

239
00:30:03,433 --> 00:30:05,220
Charlie, let him go!

240
00:30:05,336 --> 00:30:08,089
This is a mistake!
We can't keep letting these people go!

241
00:30:08,210 --> 00:30:09,409
We gave him our word!

242
00:30:19,993 --> 00:30:22,654
Go on.
Get out of here.

243
00:30:45,729 --> 00:30:47,093
The baby isn't Jin's.

244
00:30:51,635 --> 00:30:54,468
We tried to have a baby
back in Korea and couldn't.

245
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,200
And the doctor...

246
00:31:00,136 --> 00:31:01,747
he told me Jin was infertile.

247
00:31:02,885 --> 00:31:04,162
And then you came here.

248
00:31:05,759 --> 00:31:06,759
What?

249
00:31:07,637 --> 00:31:10,966
Did you know that
the average male sperm count

250
00:31:11,098 --> 00:31:14,356
is between 60 and 80 million?

251
00:31:16,290 --> 00:31:17,314
But on this island,

252
00:31:18,290 --> 00:31:19,548
it's five times that.

253
00:31:20,322 --> 00:31:21,599
We call that good odds.

254
00:31:24,883 --> 00:31:25,883
You ready?

255
00:31:28,114 --> 00:31:29,256
Yes.

256
00:31:29,448 --> 00:31:31,329
You wanna lift up your shirt a little?

257
00:31:32,866 --> 00:31:33,946
It's cold.

258
00:31:37,445 --> 00:31:38,556
Will I see the baby?

259
00:31:39,010 --> 00:31:42,489
Maybe. It's your first trimester,
so it's a little iffy.

260
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:46,587
If you don't see a heartbeat,
don't worry about it.

261
00:31:46,761 --> 00:31:47,806
It's just early.

262
00:31:50,511 --> 00:31:51,511
How does it work?

263
00:31:52,408 --> 00:31:54,844
Well, I take a measurement of the fetus,

264
00:31:54,945 --> 00:31:56,111
and that will tell us

265
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:57,931
when your baby was conceived,

266
00:32:00,010 --> 00:32:01,343
and then we'll know who.

267
00:32:06,068 --> 00:32:07,170
Are you okay?

268
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:11,021
I lose either way.

269
00:32:13,423 --> 00:32:14,696
If I'm going to live...

270
00:32:16,570 --> 00:32:18,719
that means the baby's not Jin's.

271
00:32:20,671 --> 00:32:22,251
Do you still want to do this?

272
00:32:24,945 --> 00:32:25,945
Yes.

273
00:32:29,508 --> 00:32:30,508
Moment of truth.

274
00:35:16,254 --> 00:35:17,322
There it is.

275
00:35:18,444 --> 00:35:19,444
There's your baby.

276
00:35:19,725 --> 00:35:20,827
Can you see?

277
00:35:25,843 --> 00:35:26,900
I can see it.

278
00:35:30,415 --> 00:35:31,495
Is it a boy or a girl?

279
00:35:31,597 --> 00:35:33,529
It's... it's a little early,

280
00:35:34,203 --> 00:35:35,301
but...

281
00:35:36,317 --> 00:35:37,714
do you see that little flutter?

282
00:35:40,295 --> 00:35:41,806
That's the heart beating.

283
00:35:47,104 --> 00:35:49,309
It's very strong. It's very healthy.

284
00:35:57,105 --> 00:35:59,776
You crashed here 90 days ago.

285
00:36:01,716 --> 00:36:04,489
The baby was conceived
about eight weeks ago,

286
00:36:05,245 --> 00:36:07,393
so... around 53 days.

287
00:36:12,131 --> 00:36:13,853
You got pregnant on the island.

288
00:36:18,471 --> 00:36:21,176
I am sorry. I'm so sorry, Sun.

289
00:36:22,329 --> 00:36:24,090
I will do everything that I can.

290
00:36:35,768 --> 00:36:36,922
It's Jin's.

291
00:38:13,048 --> 00:38:14,341
So how long do I have?

292
00:38:17,211 --> 00:38:20,215
Most of the women made it into
the middle of their second trimester.

293
00:38:24,017 --> 00:38:25,725
Nobody made it to their third.

294
00:38:28,474 --> 00:38:30,360
That gives me two months.

295
00:38:34,774 --> 00:38:35,808
I am...

296
00:38:40,158 --> 00:38:41,800
very happy the baby's Jin's.

297
00:38:43,847 --> 00:38:45,620
You gave me good news, Juliet.

298
00:38:47,949 --> 00:38:49,400
It was my pleasure, Sun.

299
00:38:52,583 --> 00:38:55,685
I'm gonna go back inside and make sure
that I didn't miss anything.

300
00:38:56,256 --> 00:38:59,370
I don't wanna take the chance
that we didn't cover our tracks.

301
00:39:03,381 --> 00:39:04,881
Do you wanna wait out here?

302
00:39:06,381 --> 00:39:07,381
All right.

303
00:39:15,944 --> 00:39:16,944
Thank you.

304
00:39:52,319 --> 00:39:54,541
Ben, it's 6:00 a.m. on Saturday morning.

305
00:39:57,317 --> 00:39:58,317
Kwon is pregnant.

306
00:39:58,445 --> 00:40:01,030
The fetus is healthy
and was conceived on island

307
00:40:01,132 --> 00:40:02,132
with her husband.

308
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:04,320
He was sterile before they got here.

309
00:40:04,676 --> 00:40:07,144
I'm still working on getting
samples from the other women.

310
00:40:07,259 --> 00:40:08,943
I should have Austen's soon.

311
00:40:09,256 --> 00:40:11,144
I'll report back when I know more.

312
00:40:18,505 --> 00:40:19,505
I hate you.

313
00:40:27,748 --> 00:40:29,241
You can't trust 'em, you know.

314
00:40:30,026 --> 00:40:31,709
- What's that?
- The others...

315
00:40:32,150 --> 00:40:33,413
The one you let go.

316
00:40:34,104 --> 00:40:36,405
He'll be back tomorrow
with five of his mates.

317
00:40:36,645 --> 00:40:37,921
Should've killed him.

318
00:40:38,808 --> 00:40:39,903
Charlie.

319
00:40:40,005 --> 00:40:42,003
- Tight.
- Okay.

320
00:40:42,726 --> 00:40:43,817
You know, brother,

321
00:40:44,754 --> 00:40:45,754
by my count,

322
00:40:47,816 --> 00:40:50,193
you've killed more of them
than they've killed of you.

323
00:40:50,460 --> 00:40:51,493
They started it.

324
00:40:52,065 --> 00:40:54,385
Just 'cause one comes
traipsing back with Jack and Kate

325
00:40:54,487 --> 00:40:56,743
doesn't mean that we can
trust them now.

326
00:41:17,202 --> 00:41:18,217
Mom?

327
00:41:22,499 --> 00:41:23,612
Where am I?

328
00:41:25,090 --> 00:41:26,828
Take it easy.
You had a giant branch...

329
00:41:26,930 --> 00:41:28,527
- Where am I?
- I don't know.

330
00:41:29,569 --> 00:41:30,822
You're on an island.

331
00:41:31,752 --> 00:41:33,010
Are you here to rescue us?

332
00:41:33,318 --> 00:41:35,692
Are there more of you?
can you make your phone work?

333
00:41:36,049 --> 00:41:37,091
Who are you?

334
00:41:37,193 --> 00:41:40,254
Hugo Reyes.
I crashed here on Oceanic flight 815.

335
00:41:40,819 --> 00:41:41,965
A bunch of us survived.

336
00:41:42,067 --> 00:41:44,442
Is that why you're here?
Were you looking for us?

337
00:41:45,575 --> 00:41:46,695
815?

338
00:41:48,321 --> 00:41:51,040
Flight 815? The one from Sydney?

339
00:41:53,172 --> 00:41:55,344
No. That's not possible.

340
00:41:55,446 --> 00:41:58,180
Yeah, I know. It wasn't easy,
but we found food...

341
00:41:58,515 --> 00:42:00,624
- in the hatch...
- No, flight 815, they...

342
00:42:01,882 --> 00:42:03,187
They found the plane.

343
00:42:05,818 --> 00:42:07,151
There were no survivors.

344
00:42:11,188 --> 00:42:12,277
They were all dead.

345
00:42:17,442 --> 00:42:18,442
What?
