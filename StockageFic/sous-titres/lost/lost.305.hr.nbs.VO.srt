00:00:00,224 --> 00:00:01,977
<i>Previously on</i> Lost...

2
00:00:02,439 --> 00:00:04,404
Stop! Or I'll shoot!

3
00:00:04,481 --> 00:00:05,983
No, you won't Sun.

4
00:00:08,583 --> 00:00:10,278
Jack, I need your help.

5
00:00:12,198 --> 00:00:13,228
They're not hers.

6
00:00:16,734 --> 00:00:17,890
She's gone.

7
00:00:20,742 --> 00:00:22,476
The plane was loaded with heroin.

8
00:00:26,078 --> 00:00:27,330
Where did you find this?

9
00:00:27,496 --> 00:00:29,153
In the jungle.
I found it in the jungle.

10
00:00:29,191 --> 00:00:30,232
Take me there.

11
00:00:41,011 --> 00:00:43,384
Eko? Who's that?

12
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:45,097
He's my brother.

13
00:00:48,833 --> 00:00:51,240
Forgive me. Forgive me.

14
00:01:08,604 --> 00:01:09,798
Here, eat.

15
00:01:11,764 --> 00:01:12,804
It's okay, Yemi.

16
00:01:17,559 --> 00:01:18,561
Eko.

17
00:01:30,318 --> 00:01:32,379
All right, Eko. Go.

18
00:01:37,311 --> 00:01:38,986
Did you hear me? Go.

19
00:01:39,295 --> 00:01:40,917
Confess that
you have stolen.

20
00:01:42,015 --> 00:01:43,248
Yemi was hungry.

21
00:01:43,922 --> 00:01:45,540
That is not an excuse.

22
00:01:45,578 --> 00:01:47,235
You have sinned, Eko.

23
00:01:48,583 --> 00:01:49,855
Hunger does not matter.

24
00:01:55,895 --> 00:01:56,877
Now go.

25
00:01:57,301 --> 00:01:58,707
Ask God for forgiveness.

26
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,854
Confess!

27
00:02:35,877 --> 00:02:37,680
How long
has he been like this?

28
00:02:38,343 --> 00:02:39,324
Couple days, now.

29
00:02:42,888 --> 00:02:45,497
Eko, can you hear me?

30
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:52,092
What happened to him?

31
00:02:52,689 --> 00:02:55,602
Before or after we saved him
from the polar bear cave?

32
00:02:56,489 --> 00:02:58,864
Come on. Locke will want
to know you guys are back.

33
00:03:05,557 --> 00:03:06,655
Stay alive, dude.

34
00:03:07,464 --> 00:03:08,466
Okay?

35
00:03:19,162 --> 00:03:20,433
What are you doing here?

36
00:03:21,559 --> 00:03:23,504
I have come
to give my confession.

37
00:03:25,488 --> 00:03:26,567
Hello, Eko.

38
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:28,466
Hello, brother.

39
00:03:28,735 --> 00:03:31,859
I have some merchandise
that I need to get out of the country.

40
00:03:31,936 --> 00:03:32,996
You mean drugs.

41
00:03:33,054 --> 00:03:36,347
You make us priests and we will
fly the drugs out ourselves.

42
00:03:36,377 --> 00:03:38,429
My signature does not
make you a priest, Eko.

43
00:03:39,238 --> 00:03:40,509
You could never be a priest.

44
00:03:43,412 --> 00:03:45,996
No more! Stop now!

45
00:04:01,428 --> 00:04:02,449
Father.

46
00:04:04,356 --> 00:04:05,512
Are you okay, father?

47
00:04:07,544 --> 00:04:09,778
Eko. Eko, wake up.

48
00:04:25,873 --> 00:04:27,433
It is time to confess...

49
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:32,422
to be judged, brother.

50
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:38,102
I will be waiting.

51
00:04:40,037 --> 00:04:41,386
You know
where to find me.

52
00:04:45,946 --> 00:04:47,121
You guys smell smoke?

53
00:04:49,897 --> 00:04:51,034
Get him clear!

54
00:04:52,012 --> 00:04:53,130
Help me!

55
00:04:56,134 --> 00:04:57,136
Bring him out.

56
00:04:57,984 --> 00:04:59,005
Bring him out.

57
00:04:59,061 --> 00:05:01,149
- We gotta get outta here.
- Cover him with this.

58
00:05:01,286 --> 00:05:02,364
Be careful!
Be careful!

59
00:05:07,191 --> 00:05:08,640
Lay him down.

60
00:05:11,317 --> 00:05:12,338
You're okay.

61
00:05:12,530 --> 00:05:13,570
You're all right.

62
00:05:15,785 --> 00:05:17,017
My brother...

63
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:20,503
My... brother.

64
00:05:20,742 --> 00:05:21,821
You're all right.

65
00:05:22,052 --> 00:05:23,439
It's okay. Okay.

66
00:05:24,074 --> 00:05:25,192
You're all right.

67
00:05:25,307 --> 00:05:26,521
I'll be back.

68
00:05:27,054 --> 00:05:29,635
Brother... Yemi...

69
00:05:30,078 --> 00:05:31,083
Charlie!

70
00:05:31,802 --> 00:05:34,082
- Is everyone okay?
- Yeah. We're good.

71
00:05:34,159 --> 00:05:35,218
Where's Eko?

72
00:05:35,437 --> 00:05:37,478
Hurley and I
pulled him out over...

73
00:05:40,964 --> 00:05:42,230
he was right there.

74
00:06:21,949 --> 00:06:23,316
Good evening, Jack.

75
00:06:25,566 --> 00:06:26,780
Good evening, Ben.

76
00:06:27,146 --> 00:06:29,223
I was hoping you might
join me for a walk.

77
00:06:31,183 --> 00:06:32,185
What?

78
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:33,755
Well, you say that like...

79
00:06:34,561 --> 00:06:36,449
you're not gonna
just throw a bag over my head

80
00:06:36,507 --> 00:06:38,358
and drag me outta here if I say no.

81
00:06:39,648 --> 00:06:40,843
Then don't say no.

82
00:06:43,188 --> 00:06:44,690
Why don't you put this on?

83
00:06:51,321 --> 00:06:52,458
I'll wait outside.

84
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:56,291
Does it hurt?

85
00:06:58,872 --> 00:06:59,900
Sorry?

86
00:07:04,284 --> 00:07:05,960
Your neck, does it hurt?

87
00:07:07,462 --> 00:07:09,690
Any numbness
in your fingers and toes,

88
00:07:09,767 --> 00:07:11,212
like pins and needles

89
00:07:11,251 --> 00:07:12,618
when your foot falls asleep,

90
00:07:12,657 --> 00:07:13,963
but permanent?

91
00:07:17,655 --> 00:07:19,658
Why are you asking me
these questions, Jack?

92
00:07:20,583 --> 00:07:21,639
Because, Ben,

93
00:07:22,448 --> 00:07:24,124
you have a tumor on your spine--

94
00:07:24,182 --> 00:07:25,474
an aggressive tumor...

95
00:07:26,302 --> 00:07:28,255
that is going to kill you.

96
00:07:31,868 --> 00:07:34,207
I don't know when those
X-rays were taken that I saw,

97
00:07:34,303 --> 00:07:36,344
but unless
they were very recent...

98
00:07:38,921 --> 00:07:41,024
you're not gonna be
taking walks much longer.

99
00:07:43,656 --> 00:07:45,689
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

100
00:07:46,043 --> 00:07:49,164
Okay. My mistake, then.

101
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:54,726
I'm ready
whenever you are.

102
00:08:14,458 --> 00:08:15,575
Stay here.

103
00:08:31,629 --> 00:08:34,095
As we prepare to send
Colleen on her way,

104
00:08:34,822 --> 00:08:36,017
I'd like to take a moment...

105
00:08:36,055 --> 00:08:37,249
I hate funerals.

106
00:08:39,079 --> 00:08:40,293
He let you out?

107
00:08:43,114 --> 00:08:44,501
Gave me a new shirt, too.

108
00:08:50,233 --> 00:08:51,408
Bye, Jack.

109
00:09:25,102 --> 00:09:27,240
Why did you show him my X-rays?

110
00:09:28,311 --> 00:09:29,987
I didn't tell him
they were yours...

111
00:09:31,828 --> 00:09:33,118
But I guess you did.

112
00:09:46,004 --> 00:09:48,546
I think I know how
to find Jack, Kate and Sawyer.

113
00:09:49,606 --> 00:09:52,072
Can I ask why he's being
included in the conversation?

114
00:09:52,804 --> 00:09:54,614
Is that supposed
to hurt my feelings?

115
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:56,585
Tell him
what you told me.

116
00:09:56,951 --> 00:09:58,357
The computer in the hatch

117
00:09:58,492 --> 00:10:00,424
wasn't only
for pushing the button.

118
00:10:01,432 --> 00:10:03,031
I'm pretty sure

119
00:10:04,127 --> 00:10:06,573
that it can be used
to communicate with other stations.

120
00:10:07,454 --> 00:10:08,591
This is fascinating,

121
00:10:08,845 --> 00:10:10,695
but you just told me the hatch exploded.

122
00:10:11,352 --> 00:10:12,334
One of them did.

123
00:10:14,494 --> 00:10:16,812
You want to try
and communicate with the others.

124
00:10:17,159 --> 00:10:18,160
Yep.

125
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:20,432
No luck, dudes.

126
00:10:20,914 --> 00:10:22,050
We looked everywhere.

127
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:23,610
Eko's gone.

128
00:10:24,034 --> 00:10:25,190
There was no trail.

129
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,532
Not that we, like, know
what a trail looks like.

130
00:10:27,764 --> 00:10:30,140
When you pulled him out of
the tent, did he say anything?

131
00:10:30,179 --> 00:10:31,469
Nothing coherent.

132
00:10:31,527 --> 00:10:32,664
He was just mumbling

133
00:10:32,876 --> 00:10:34,392
"my brother, my brother."

134
00:10:36,954 --> 00:10:38,495
Sayid, pack your gear.

135
00:10:38,514 --> 00:10:39,948
We're going to that computer.

136
00:10:40,179 --> 00:10:41,373
Wait. What about Eko?

137
00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:42,606
We'll catch up to him.

138
00:10:43,222 --> 00:10:45,026
We're all going
to the same place.

139
00:11:15,677 --> 00:11:16,852
You're home, father.

140
00:12:26,027 --> 00:12:27,009
Father?

141
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:33,029
I was looking
for father Yemi.

142
00:12:38,974 --> 00:12:40,611
Father Yemi is... Is gone.

143
00:12:42,364 --> 00:12:44,383
He was called away
quite suddenly...

144
00:12:44,808 --> 00:12:48,399
an emergency
at the refugee camp down south.

145
00:12:49,093 --> 00:12:50,268
I am Amina.

146
00:12:50,865 --> 00:12:52,097
I work at the clinic.

147
00:12:53,292 --> 00:12:55,779
This is my son Daniel.
He's the altar boy here.

148
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:00,679
Are you taking his place?

149
00:13:01,661 --> 00:13:02,682
Yes.

150
00:13:04,069 --> 00:13:06,030
Will father Yemi
still go to London?

151
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:09,521
- London?
- He was leaving at the end of the week.

152
00:13:09,675 --> 00:13:11,514
He was going
to continue his studies.

153
00:13:12,284 --> 00:13:14,030
I will
take his place there, too.

154
00:14:04,658 --> 00:14:06,630
Don't! No!
Please!

155
00:14:14,865 --> 00:14:15,886
Confess.

156
00:14:28,081 --> 00:14:29,612
We're headed now to the Pearl station.

157
00:14:29,623 --> 00:14:32,077
There's a computer there that
might help us find our people.

158
00:14:32,115 --> 00:14:33,501
Anybody want to come along?

159
00:14:34,539 --> 00:14:36,348
What do you mean:
"Anybody wanna come along"?

160
00:14:36,388 --> 00:14:39,528
I mean, if you'd like to join us,
it's a free island.

161
00:14:41,388 --> 00:14:43,882
Yeah, see, Jack would go
and do stuff alone

162
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:47,263
or he'd take Sayid or Kate.

163
00:14:48,245 --> 00:14:51,002
Yeah, well, I'm not Jack.

164
00:14:53,510 --> 00:14:54,627
The more the merrier.

165
00:14:54,724 --> 00:14:55,745
I'll go.

166
00:14:55,879 --> 00:14:57,314
- Great.
- What?

167
00:14:57,757 --> 00:15:00,460
Anybody else wanna come, meet us
at the tree line in ten minutes.

168
00:15:00,537 --> 00:15:01,558
Bring water.

169
00:15:02,502 --> 00:15:03,658
You're not serious.

170
00:15:04,611 --> 00:15:07,538
What? You always whine
about not being included.

171
00:15:07,877 --> 00:15:09,052
Now's our chance.

172
00:15:15,317 --> 00:15:17,623
Do you mind if I ask you
a question, brother?

173
00:15:17,873 --> 00:15:18,875
Shoot.

174
00:15:18,894 --> 00:15:21,041
Are we going off
to poke at a computer,

175
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,550
or are we going
after your man Eko?

176
00:15:24,982 --> 00:15:26,605
Two birds, one stone.

177
00:15:29,019 --> 00:15:30,637
Eko's heading for the plane
that crashed

178
00:15:30,676 --> 00:15:32,691
on top of the entrance
to the Pearl station.

179
00:15:34,116 --> 00:15:35,837
Well, that's quite
a coincidence.

180
00:15:38,043 --> 00:15:39,839
Don't mistake coincidence
for fate.

181
00:16:22,749 --> 00:16:24,309
You're not supposed
to do that.

182
00:16:24,832 --> 00:16:26,065
That's holy water.

183
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,497
I'm washing away my sins.

184
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:31,842
- Father Yemi would never...
- I'm not father Yemi.

185
00:16:36,705 --> 00:16:37,822
Wait there!

186
00:16:52,427 --> 00:16:54,195
Where...
Where is father Yemi?

187
00:16:55,132 --> 00:16:56,268
Who wants to know?

188
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:07,290
Perhaps you did not
hear me.

189
00:17:07,426 --> 00:17:08,660
I said,
where is father Yemi?

190
00:17:08,709 --> 00:17:09,961
The shipment is late.

191
00:17:10,531 --> 00:17:11,854
I just got off the telephone.

192
00:17:11,955 --> 00:17:13,876
They assure me
it will arrive on Friday.

193
00:17:13,929 --> 00:17:15,007
What shipment?

194
00:17:15,401 --> 00:17:17,807
You should explain our
arrangement to your new priest.

195
00:17:19,637 --> 00:17:22,140
We receive shipments of vaccines
from the Red Cross.

196
00:17:22,383 --> 00:17:23,809
We are allowed to keep 20%.

197
00:17:23,886 --> 00:17:25,869
The rest, we give
to Emeka and his men.

198
00:17:26,426 --> 00:17:27,890
In exchange for protection.

199
00:17:31,030 --> 00:17:32,292
So you see, father...

200
00:17:33,412 --> 00:17:35,299
everybody is happy, huh?

201
00:17:36,993 --> 00:17:38,420
Everybody's happy.

202
00:17:39,085 --> 00:17:40,664
Everybody benefits.

203
00:17:41,573 --> 00:17:45,029
So I hope you will continue
to honor our arrangement.

204
00:17:47,803 --> 00:17:49,238
I am not afraid of you.

205
00:18:07,694 --> 00:18:10,159
I'll be back for the vaccine
on Friday, father.

206
00:18:11,427 --> 00:18:13,854
You don't want more lives
on your conscience.

207
00:19:13,705 --> 00:19:14,765
Hello, Eko!

208
00:19:30,427 --> 00:19:31,997
You wanna guess
what's for lunch?

209
00:19:34,361 --> 00:19:36,518
I'm not...
I'm not big on mysteries.

210
00:19:36,749 --> 00:19:38,059
Of course you're not.

211
00:19:43,945 --> 00:19:45,833
You people have cheeseburgers?

212
00:19:47,239 --> 00:19:48,509
You have no idea

213
00:19:48,779 --> 00:19:50,763
what I went through
to make this for you.

214
00:19:51,456 --> 00:19:52,717
I killed the cow,

215
00:19:52,833 --> 00:19:54,701
processed the meat, baked the bun.

216
00:19:55,722 --> 00:19:57,013
And the fries...

217
00:19:58,342 --> 00:19:59,974
try rendering animal fat.

218
00:20:01,958 --> 00:20:02,998
No ketchup?

219
00:20:12,012 --> 00:20:13,245
I'd like to talk to him.

220
00:20:14,189 --> 00:20:16,188
Okay, so talk to him.

221
00:20:16,477 --> 00:20:18,056
Alone, please.

222
00:20:18,199 --> 00:20:19,523
I'm fine with her
being here.

223
00:20:19,581 --> 00:20:22,091
And I'm thrilled that you're fine, Jack,
but it's private.

224
00:20:23,054 --> 00:20:24,865
Doctor-patient confidentiality?

225
00:20:29,539 --> 00:20:30,569
Sure.

226
00:20:31,917 --> 00:20:32,957
Sure. Of course.

227
00:20:39,273 --> 00:20:40,525
Mind if I eat?

228
00:20:48,123 --> 00:20:50,756
We had such a wonderful plan
to break you, Jack.

229
00:20:55,210 --> 00:20:56,212
Break me?

230
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:59,620
Wear you down until you were convinced
we weren't your enemies.

231
00:21:00,391 --> 00:21:01,566
Get you to trust us.

232
00:21:03,125 --> 00:21:04,941
And then, of course,
we'd lead you to believe

233
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:06,540
that you were choosing to do

234
00:21:07,330 --> 00:21:08,659
whatever we asked you to do.

235
00:21:09,401 --> 00:21:12,894
All of this assumed, of course,
that you would get invested.

236
00:21:13,809 --> 00:21:15,119
Invested in what?

237
00:21:16,248 --> 00:21:17,442
Has it not occurred to you

238
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:20,550
that Juliet bears a striking
resemblance to your ex-wife?

239
00:21:28,026 --> 00:21:29,662
Why are you
telling me this?

240
00:21:29,904 --> 00:21:31,021
I'm telling you this, Jack,

241
00:21:31,056 --> 00:21:32,809
because my wonderful plan

242
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:35,992
got shot to sunshine

243
00:21:36,127 --> 00:21:39,119
when you saw my damned X-rays
and figured out I was dying.

244
00:21:42,411 --> 00:21:43,566
All of this...

245
00:21:45,293 --> 00:21:47,158
you brought me here
to operate on you.

246
00:21:47,249 --> 00:21:48,385
You...

247
00:21:49,219 --> 00:21:51,493
you want me
to save your life.

248
00:21:51,936 --> 00:21:54,527
No, I want you
to want to save my life.

249
00:21:56,723 --> 00:21:58,474
But we're
beyond that now, so...

250
00:22:03,169 --> 00:22:05,345
all I can ask
is that you think about it.

251
00:22:18,195 --> 00:22:19,682
Do you believe in God, Jack?

252
00:22:21,473 --> 00:22:22,475
Do you?

253
00:22:24,959 --> 00:22:28,118
Two days after I found out
I had a fatal tumor on my spine,

254
00:22:28,175 --> 00:22:30,481
a spinal surgeon
fell out of the sky.

255
00:22:34,119 --> 00:22:35,814
And if that's
not proof of God,

256
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:38,758
I don't know what is.

257
00:22:59,304 --> 00:23:00,450
You sure
you're all right?

258
00:23:01,413 --> 00:23:03,400
We can stop for a bit
and catch our breaths.

259
00:23:05,372 --> 00:23:06,547
I'm fine.

260
00:23:09,525 --> 00:23:11,768
You're heading for
the plane wreckage, aren't you?

261
00:23:12,557 --> 00:23:15,380
Charlie heard you call out for your
brother before you left the camp.

262
00:23:17,385 --> 00:23:18,988
Is that
what you're doing out here,

263
00:23:19,373 --> 00:23:20,432
looking for Yemi?

264
00:23:23,137 --> 00:23:25,564
Do not speak
my brother's name again.

265
00:23:27,921 --> 00:23:29,789
What are you
so afraid of, Eko?

266
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:38,104
You need to come back
in two days.

267
00:23:38,489 --> 00:23:39,491
Father.

268
00:23:40,203 --> 00:23:41,417
What can I do for you?

269
00:23:42,110 --> 00:23:44,234
It's that the vaccines
that you spoke of...

270
00:23:44,330 --> 00:23:46,021
how often
do the shipments come?

271
00:23:46,252 --> 00:23:48,209
Every six months,
if we are lucky.

272
00:23:51,492 --> 00:23:54,709
What makes you so interested
in our shipments of vaccine, father?

273
00:23:58,402 --> 00:24:01,002
You agreed to give
most of it to the militia?

274
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:04,382
The vaccines fetch a high price
on the black market.

275
00:24:06,515 --> 00:24:09,250
Whatever you are thinking,
do not cross these men.

276
00:24:09,948 --> 00:24:11,798
Before father Yemi,
we got nothing.

277
00:24:12,596 --> 00:24:15,004
We owe whatever vaccines
we have to his work.

278
00:24:17,539 --> 00:24:19,176
You remind me of him,
you know.

279
00:24:20,852 --> 00:24:22,123
You are a good man, too.

280
00:24:43,425 --> 00:24:45,004
I hear you have
some vaccine to sell.

281
00:24:46,044 --> 00:24:48,460
I do, but it has to be done by Sunday.

282
00:24:48,498 --> 00:24:49,789
I'm leaving the country.

283
00:24:50,521 --> 00:24:51,464
No problem.

284
00:25:03,369 --> 00:25:05,088
The hatch
is over here by the plane.

285
00:25:05,165 --> 00:25:06,639
Why don't you
take everybody down?

286
00:25:07,197 --> 00:25:08,218
And you?

287
00:25:09,104 --> 00:25:10,298
I'll be there in a minute.

288
00:25:14,074 --> 00:25:15,615
What's Eko looking for?

289
00:25:15,747 --> 00:25:17,577
His brother's body's
in that plane.

290
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:43,861
So...

291
00:25:43,996 --> 00:25:46,250
what exactly
did you see back there?

292
00:25:48,465 --> 00:25:49,871
I saw it once, you know.

293
00:25:50,430 --> 00:25:51,558
What did you see?

294
00:25:52,193 --> 00:25:54,293
I saw a very bright light.

295
00:25:56,912 --> 00:25:57,991
It was beautiful.

296
00:26:01,882 --> 00:26:03,211
That is not what I saw.

297
00:26:47,828 --> 00:26:48,979
My brother's gone.

298
00:26:50,474 --> 00:26:51,995
You set the plane on fire.

299
00:26:52,265 --> 00:26:53,989
Yemi's body could have burned.

300
00:26:54,284 --> 00:26:55,925
Not to mention animals or...

301
00:27:08,138 --> 00:27:10,469
so... you don't wanna
come down there with us?

302
00:27:17,374 --> 00:27:18,954
No, I will wait here.

303
00:27:20,167 --> 00:27:21,229
Well...

304
00:27:23,325 --> 00:27:24,808
Oh, I forgot.

305
00:27:25,983 --> 00:27:28,173
I found this
when I was looking for you.

306
00:28:15,898 --> 00:28:17,073
Hello, father.

307
00:28:19,731 --> 00:28:22,122
I hear you have a shipment
of vaccine for sale.

308
00:28:23,952 --> 00:28:26,406
If you thought you could do this
without me knowing,

309
00:28:27,446 --> 00:28:28,621
you don't know who I am.

310
00:28:33,081 --> 00:28:34,140
You know...

311
00:28:35,103 --> 00:28:36,336
you're lucky, father.

312
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:38,181
I'm a superstitious man.

313
00:28:39,548 --> 00:28:41,749
I don't relish taking
the life of a holy man.

314
00:28:42,962 --> 00:28:44,137
That is why, today,

315
00:28:46,487 --> 00:28:48,457
I'm only going to cut off
your hands.

316
00:29:06,892 --> 00:29:08,125
Please! No!

317
00:29:09,402 --> 00:29:11,117
You do not know
who I am.

318
00:29:49,263 --> 00:29:50,535
<i>I'm Dr. Mark Wickmund,</i>

319
00:29:50,641 --> 00:29:52,297
<i>and this is the orientation film</i>

320
00:29:52,374 --> 00:29:53,780
<i>for station five</i>

321
00:29:53,896 --> 00:29:55,263
<i>of Dharma Initiative.</i>

322
00:29:55,455 --> 00:29:57,497
<i>Station five, or the Pearl,</i>

323
00:29:57,928 --> 00:29:59,411
<i>is a monitoring station</i>

324
00:29:59,655 --> 00:30:03,412
<i>where the activities of participants

<i>can be observed and recorded...</i>

326
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:07,292
Well?

327
00:30:07,370 --> 00:30:08,995
The wiring
is only one way.

328
00:30:09,573 --> 00:30:10,922
It's a closed system,

329
00:30:11,037 --> 00:30:12,096
a dead end.

330
00:30:12,231 --> 00:30:13,360
Hey, guys?

331
00:30:14,381 --> 00:30:15,959
What are
these other TVs for?

332
00:30:16,903 --> 00:30:17,924
Sorry?

333
00:30:18,714 --> 00:30:20,081
All these TVs.

334
00:30:20,621 --> 00:30:23,023
This guy says
that there's six stations.

335
00:30:23,851 --> 00:30:25,299
All right, here.
Check it out.

336
00:30:30,191 --> 00:30:31,732
<i>...is a monitoring station</i>

337
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:35,698
<i>where the activities of the participants

338
00:30:36,006 --> 00:30:37,933
<i>can be observed and recorded...</i>

339
00:30:38,241 --> 00:30:40,251
Projects. More than one.

340
00:30:40,568 --> 00:30:43,640
So maybe some of these TVs are
connected to the other hatches.

341
00:30:44,006 --> 00:30:46,111
Well, I'm suddenly
feeling very stupid.

342
00:30:46,708 --> 00:30:48,843
Perhaps I could patch in
one of the other feeds,

343
00:30:49,017 --> 00:30:50,754
see if we can get
another picture.

344
00:30:51,281 --> 00:30:53,862
<i>Your tour of duty in the Pearl
will last three weeks...</i>

345
00:31:01,715 --> 00:31:03,121
The toilet still works.

346
00:31:07,550 --> 00:31:08,571
Anything yet?

347
00:31:11,691 --> 00:31:12,766
Nothing.

348
00:31:14,206 --> 00:31:15,381
What about now?

349
00:31:21,328 --> 00:31:22,695
Yeah, we got something.

350
00:31:26,798 --> 00:31:27,918
What is it?

351
00:31:28,515 --> 00:31:29,883
That's a good question.

352
00:31:31,318 --> 00:31:32,339
Those are computers.

353
00:31:33,071 --> 00:31:35,260
Great. That's what
you're looking for.

354
00:31:36,165 --> 00:31:37,513
Now we can
get out of here.

355
00:31:54,349 --> 00:31:55,736
I guess
he'll be expecting us.

356
00:32:09,756 --> 00:32:11,008
You don't
trust me anymore?

357
00:32:11,162 --> 00:32:12,510
I trust you just fine.

358
00:32:12,895 --> 00:32:14,263
Just thought I'd put a movie in.

359
00:32:14,650 --> 00:32:16,422
You know what? I'm gonna
pass on the movie.

360
00:32:16,441 --> 00:32:19,112
You'll like this one, Jack.
It's "To kill a mockingbird."

361
00:32:19,153 --> 00:32:20,097
It's a classic.

362
00:32:20,139 --> 00:32:21,719
I don't wanna
watch a movie right now.

363
00:32:21,757 --> 00:32:23,407
I'll turn
the sound down, then.

364
00:32:27,306 --> 00:32:28,962
I felt like I should apologize,

365
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:30,136
say I'm sorry.

366
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:34,162
I'm sorry
for bringing you here

367
00:32:35,049 --> 00:32:38,584
and for everything that's been done
to you and your friends.

368
00:32:39,830 --> 00:32:41,256
But you have to know...

369
00:32:42,569 --> 00:32:43,802
we were desperate.

370
00:32:45,381 --> 00:32:47,241
It was all
so we could save his life.

371
00:32:51,896 --> 00:32:52,931
Ben...

372
00:32:55,196 --> 00:32:56,545
he's a great man.

373
00:32:59,428 --> 00:33:01,321
I know you find that
hard to believe,

374
00:33:02,573 --> 00:33:03,709
but he is.

375
00:33:08,461 --> 00:33:10,021
You probably feel like...

376
00:33:11,215 --> 00:33:15,045
you don't have a choice,
but you do, Jack.

377
00:33:18,506 --> 00:33:20,403
Free will is all
we've really got, right?

378
00:33:27,539 --> 00:33:28,637
Anyway...

379
00:33:30,062 --> 00:33:31,834
just wanted
to put in my two cents.

380
00:33:40,082 --> 00:33:42,034
I told you before
you can trust me.

381
00:33:46,053 --> 00:33:49,093
I want you to trust me now,

382
00:33:49,180 --> 00:33:51,053
when I tell you
that doing the surgery

383
00:33:51,130 --> 00:33:52,216
is absolutely

384
00:33:53,295 --> 00:33:55,356
the right thing
for you to do.

385
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:02,900
It's the right thing,
because he deserves  to live.

386
00:34:16,472 --> 00:34:18,028
Turn the movie off.

387
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:20,255
Turn it off. Now.

388
00:34:24,647 --> 00:34:26,111
All right. It's off.

389
00:34:39,584 --> 00:34:41,213
Think about what I said...

390
00:34:42,022 --> 00:34:43,043
please.

391
00:34:53,250 --> 00:34:54,369
Where are you going?

392
00:34:54,986 --> 00:34:55,987
London.

393
00:34:56,608 --> 00:34:57,899
Are you a bad man?

394
00:35:02,458 --> 00:35:04,275
My mom says
you are a bad man.

395
00:35:07,864 --> 00:35:09,225
Only God knows.

396
00:35:17,733 --> 00:35:19,400
I see
you have your vaccine.

397
00:35:19,637 --> 00:35:21,400
Do you expect me
to be grateful?

398
00:35:22,239 --> 00:35:23,800
I know what
you were planning to do.

399
00:35:24,331 --> 00:35:25,260
Those men, I helped...

400
00:35:25,337 --> 00:35:27,461
Those men will be replaced
by other men.

401
00:35:32,636 --> 00:35:33,792
What are they doing?

402
00:35:34,368 --> 00:35:35,889
What is the meaning of this?

403
00:35:36,398 --> 00:35:38,201
They are
boarding up the church.

404
00:35:39,819 --> 00:35:41,360
We can no longer use it.

405
00:35:42,559 --> 00:35:43,863
This is Yemi's church.

406
00:35:44,768 --> 00:35:45,963
You have no right to do this.

407
00:35:46,001 --> 00:35:47,388
It is no longer sacred,

408
00:35:48,151 --> 00:35:50,173
and one day, you'll be judged
for what you did.

409
00:35:53,082 --> 00:35:54,326
If I were you,

410
00:35:54,904 --> 00:35:56,653
I would start
making my peace now.

411
00:35:57,077 --> 00:35:59,309
I would go to London
and begin to repent,

412
00:35:59,559 --> 00:36:01,915
because you owe God
for every life you've taken.

413
00:36:04,276 --> 00:36:06,116
And you truly believe
this is Yemi's?

414
00:36:09,429 --> 00:36:10,815
You owe him one church.

415
00:36:36,183 --> 00:36:37,214
Wait.

416
00:36:47,259 --> 00:36:49,467
You say you want
to hear my confession.

417
00:36:50,929 --> 00:36:52,709
Why?
Why now, eh?

418
00:36:54,423 --> 00:36:56,547
Show yourself!
Where are you?!

419
00:36:57,787 --> 00:36:59,060
Where?!

420
00:37:19,389 --> 00:37:20,525
Are you ready, Eko?

421
00:37:25,267 --> 00:37:26,269
Yes.

422
00:37:28,002 --> 00:37:29,272
I am ready, Yemi.

423
00:37:46,143 --> 00:37:48,166
I ask for no forgiveness,
father...

424
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:51,680
for I have not sinned.

425
00:37:54,026 --> 00:37:56,588
I have only done
what I needed to do to survive.

426
00:38:03,271 --> 00:38:05,040
A small boy once asked me

427
00:38:06,215 --> 00:38:07,737
if I was a bad man.

428
00:38:09,853 --> 00:38:11,413
If I could answer him now,

429
00:38:12,549 --> 00:38:13,686
I would tell him

430
00:38:14,886 --> 00:38:16,539
that when I was a young boy,

431
00:38:17,984 --> 00:38:19,429
I killed a man

432
00:38:19,853 --> 00:38:21,471
to save my brother's life.

433
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:27,564
I am not sorry for this.

434
00:38:29,846 --> 00:38:31,387
I am proud of this.

435
00:38:40,701 --> 00:38:43,161
I did not ask for the life
that I was given,

436
00:38:44,796 --> 00:38:47,493
but it was given
nonetheless.

437
00:38:51,122 --> 00:38:52,760
I did my best.

438
00:39:00,458 --> 00:39:02,688
You speak to me
as if I were your brother.

439
00:39:09,505 --> 00:39:10,622
Who are you?

440
00:39:18,792 --> 00:39:19,909
Who are you?!

441
00:39:20,868 --> 00:39:21,985
Who are you?!

442
00:39:29,604 --> 00:39:31,049
Who are you?

443
00:39:52,769 --> 00:39:54,426
The Lord is my shepherd.

444
00:39:55,180 --> 00:39:56,586
I shall not want...

445
00:40:53,797 --> 00:40:56,224
It's okay. It's okay.

446
00:42:03,130 --> 00:42:04,596
What did he say, John?

447
00:42:08,534 --> 00:42:09,757
He said...

448
00:42:09,950 --> 00:42:11,009
we're next.

449
00:42:12,203 --> 00:42:15,112
