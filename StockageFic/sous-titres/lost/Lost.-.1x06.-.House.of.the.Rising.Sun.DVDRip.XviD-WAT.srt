Sir?

3
00:00:09,943 --> 00:00:12,844
l'm gonna have to ask
that you open the door.

[alarm buzzing]

5
00:00:20,186 --> 00:00:22,518
How about we talk
about that other thing?

6
00:00:22,589 --> 00:00:25,057
The transmission Abdul
picked up on his radio.

7
00:00:25,125 --> 00:00:28,026
The French chick that said,
''They're all dead.''

8
00:00:28,094 --> 00:00:30,494
- We have to tell the others.
- Tell them what?

9
00:00:30,563 --> 00:00:33,896
No one tell them anything.
lf we tell them what we know...

10
00:00:33,967 --> 00:00:35,366
...we take away their hope.

11
00:00:35,435 --> 00:00:36,868
So we lie?

12
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:52,411
l found fresh water
up in the valley.

13
00:00:52,485 --> 00:00:54,749
l'll take a group in
at first light.

14
00:00:54,821 --> 00:00:57,221
lf you don't go,
find another way to contribute

15
00:00:57,290 --> 00:01:00,191
because ''Every man for himself''
is not gonna work.

16
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:02,319
[Michael] Uh, excuse me.

17
00:01:02,395 --> 00:01:04,693
Have you...
Have you seen my boy?

[speaking Korean]

19
00:01:14,974 --> 00:01:17,943
l am going off...

20
00:01:18,011 --> 00:01:20,741
...away to hunt.

21
00:01:20,814 --> 00:01:23,112
And l was wondering if you...

22
00:01:23,183 --> 00:01:26,880
...could keep an eye on my boy

23
00:01:26,953 --> 00:01:29,786

24
00:01:31,591 --> 00:01:33,149
You're cool with this, right?

25
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:03,783
- l just want to know.
- Well, you're not gonna know.

26
00:02:03,857 --> 00:02:06,621
- What's the big deal?
- lt's not a big deal.

27
00:02:06,693 --> 00:02:09,218
[Jack] l had reasons.
l don't wanna put it out there.

28
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:11,286
lt's just that you...

29
00:02:11,364 --> 00:02:13,958
...and your tattoos...

30
00:02:14,033 --> 00:02:15,625
...don't add up.

31
00:02:18,605 --> 00:02:22,200
You're one of those hardcore
spinal surgeons?

32
00:02:22,275 --> 00:02:24,539
That's me. Hardcore.

00:02:24,611 --> 00:02:27,603
lf you're finished verbally copulating,
we should move.

34
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:31,309
There's a beach of people waiting
for us to get drinking water for them.

35
00:02:31,384 --> 00:02:34,182
And the great white hunter's
getting restless.

36
00:02:34,254 --> 00:02:37,712
Okay. Let's do this.

37
00:02:38,358 --> 00:02:41,919
Hey, Charlie,
ask Jack about his tattoos.

38
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:45,226
Oh, you guys have
an inside joke.

39

- [Charlie] Absolutely.

look through this stuff?

00:07:45,364 --> 00:07:47,559
There could be
something useful in here.

He's got a point.

67

- l do?
- Yeah. Bring me your bottles.

68
00:07:52,538 --> 00:07:55,996
And keep an eye out for any
medical supplies, drugs in particular.

69

Drugs. Right.

70
00:08:28,407 --> 00:08:29,931
Don't move.

00:08:30,943 --> 00:08:32,205
l was just gonna take...

72
00:08:32,278 --> 00:08:35,406
Do not move.

73
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:39,647
- [Jack] What's going on?
- Shh.

74
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:42,347
He's standing on a beehive.

75
00:08:43,756 --> 00:08:45,223
What's it doing there?

76
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:47,851
Beehives are supposed
to be in trees.

77
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:51,595
- What now?
- lf he moves, he'll split the hive.

78
00:08:51,664 --> 00:08:53,359
l don't like bees, okay?

79
00:08:53,432 --> 00:08:56,026
l have an irrational fear of bees.
l'm allergic...

80
00:08:56,102 --> 00:08:58,536
Please be quiet.

81
00:08:58,604 --> 00:09:00,902
We need to get something
to seal the hive.

82
00:09:00,973 --> 00:09:03,737
- To cover it?
- Yeah, hurry.

83
00:09:06,078 --> 00:09:07,875

l'm tired of saying this.

00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:10,743
l was just walking the beach
with my son,

00:09:10,816 --> 00:09:13,717

this dude is all up on me.

[shouts in Korean]

88
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:24,286
Surely there must be something
you're not telling us.

89

Surely?
Where are you from, man?

90
00:09:28,467 --> 00:09:30,401
Tikrit.

91
00:09:31,304 --> 00:09:34,899
- lraq.
- Okay, l don't know how it is in lraq,

92
00:09:34,974 --> 00:09:37,636
but in the United States of America,
where l'm from,

93
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:39,837
Korean people
don't like black people.

94
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:41,903
Did you know that?

95
00:09:41,981 --> 00:09:45,712
- [shouts in Korean]
- So maybe you ought to talk to him!

The cuffs stay on.

98
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:52,080
- Louder, Omar. Maybe she'll understand.
- Guys.

99
00:09:52,158 --> 00:09:55,059
That Chinese dude's gonna get
pretty crispy out here.

100
00:09:55,127 --> 00:09:58,221
- How long are you gonna keep him?
- He tried to kill Michael.

101
00:09:58,297 --> 00:10:02,358
We all saw it.
The cuffs stay on until we know why.

102
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:09,769
Come on, man. Let's go.

103
00:10:32,031 --> 00:10:37,094
[speaking Korean]

104
00:12:11,497 --> 00:12:13,021
[Jack] Okay.

105
00:12:13,099 --> 00:12:14,657
Just keep still, man.

106
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:16,497
l'm gonna try to cover the hive.

107
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:19,333
This is the most crap idea ever.
lt's never gonna work.

108
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:22,806
- Pull yourself together, son.
- lt wouldn't be an irrational fear

109
00:12:22,875 --> 00:12:24,706
if l could pull myself together.

110
00:13:20,599 --> 00:13:22,931
Who is he?
How did he get here?

111
00:13:23,002 --> 00:13:25,197
l can't exactly perform an autopsy,

112
00:13:25,271 --> 00:13:28,672
but there doesn't seem to be
any major trauma to the bones.

113
00:13:28,741 --> 00:13:32,336
We got another one over here.
Someone laid them to rest here.

114
00:13:32,411 --> 00:13:33,673
- Who?
- l don't know.

115
00:13:33,746 --> 00:13:35,577
Where did they come from?

116
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:38,208
Didn't you guys shoot a polar bear
last week?

117
00:13:38,284 --> 00:13:40,844
- Yeah.
- Where'd that come from?

118
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:48,621
- Any idea how long they've been here?
- Long. lt takes 40 or 50 years

119
00:13:48,694 --> 00:13:51,162
for clothing to degrade like this.

120
00:13:56,068 --> 00:13:57,399
What is it?

121
00:14:03,075 --> 00:14:06,567
Hello! Anybody there?

122
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:09,971
Everyone all right?

123
00:14:10,716 --> 00:14:13,617
- A few stings aside.
- You two run away fantastically.

124
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:15,813
l'm glad my diversion spared you.

125
00:14:15,888 --> 00:14:18,823
l was only stung
several hundred times.

126
00:14:20,659 --> 00:14:22,286
Oh, and...

127
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:24,090
. . .someone left this.

128
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:29,964
lt was. . . lt was full of bees.

129
00:14:30,035 --> 00:14:32,731
l'd have thought C's, actually.

130
00:14:34,206 --> 00:14:35,195
Sorry.

131
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:39,533
Bloody hell.

132
00:14:39,612 --> 00:14:42,740
Are these the people
who were here before us?

133
00:14:45,618 --> 00:14:47,677
What are you talking about?

134
00:14:50,689 --> 00:14:52,247
Well, just...

135
00:14:52,324 --> 00:14:56,988
You know, there could have been
people here before us, right?

136
00:14:57,062 --> 00:14:58,427
Clearly.

137
00:14:59,965 --> 00:15:01,592
But who were these men?

138
00:15:01,667 --> 00:15:03,464
Actually, one of them is female.

139
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:10,968
Our very own Adam and Eve.

140
00:15:12,011 --> 00:15:13,774
Ah!

141
00:15:13,846 --> 00:15:17,282

[phone ringing]

144
00:16:46,105 --> 00:16:49,438
One of us should stay and help
Charlie salvage the wreckage.

145
00:16:50,376 --> 00:16:53,174
- [Kate] You offering?
- Sure.

146
00:16:53,245 --> 00:16:56,214
Give me a chance to get to know him
a little better.

147
00:16:56,281 --> 00:17:00,684
We should move out.
People are probably getting thirsty.

148
00:17:02,888 --> 00:17:04,082
What?

149
00:17:05,758 --> 00:17:09,125
Forty-six people need to drink
a half gallon a day each.

150
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:12,823
Carrying all this water back and forth
is gonna be a real pain in the ass.

151
00:17:12,898 --> 00:17:15,867
You're starting to make me
regret volunteering.

152
00:17:16,969 --> 00:17:20,837
These caves make too good a shelter
just to be used for burial.

153
00:17:21,507 --> 00:17:25,170
Adam and Eve,
they must have lived here.

154
00:17:25,244 --> 00:17:28,304
Their plane crashed,
or maybe they were shipwrecked.

155
00:17:29,348 --> 00:17:32,647
They probably found this place
and knew they could survive here.

156
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:35,278
Unlimited supply of fresh water.

157
00:17:35,354 --> 00:17:37,845
Tree canopy keeps
the temperature down,

158
00:17:37,923 --> 00:17:39,049
shields out the sun.

159
00:17:40,192 --> 00:17:44,060
The openings are narrow, easier
for protection against predators.

160
00:17:44,129 --> 00:17:47,690
We don't need to bring
the water to the people.

161
00:17:47,766 --> 00:17:50,735
We need to bring the people
to the water.

162
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:56,101
l think we could live here.

163
00:18:16,829 --> 00:18:19,093
Hey, what are you doing?

164
00:18:20,499 --> 00:18:23,093
Did you say something
to my boy?

165
00:18:23,168 --> 00:18:24,795
[speaking Korean]

166
00:18:29,274 --> 00:18:31,174
Yeah, nice talking to you too.

167
00:18:32,878 --> 00:18:34,607
Move it, Walt.

168
00:18:38,517 --> 00:18:40,985
- How come he doesn't like us?
- What?

169
00:18:41,053 --> 00:18:44,079
You said people like him
don't like people like us.

170
00:18:44,823 --> 00:18:48,190
Oh, man. No...

171
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:50,751
Look, that's not true, and...

172
00:18:50,829 --> 00:18:53,593
l don't think like that anyway.
l was...

173
00:18:54,433 --> 00:18:56,094
l was angry.

174
00:18:56,401 --> 00:18:59,734
- What did you do to him?
- What did l do to him?

175
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:03,332
You tell me.
l've been with you since we crashed.

176
00:19:03,408 --> 00:19:06,935
Have you seen me do anything
to anyone?

177
00:19:07,012 --> 00:19:09,242
What kind of man
do you think l am?

178
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:13,878
What did your mother
say about me?

179
00:19:15,554 --> 00:19:17,522
She never talked about you.

180
00:19:18,724 --> 00:19:20,919
You don't know anything
about me, do you?

181
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:23,461
- You don't know anything about me.
- l know a lot.

182
00:19:23,529 --> 00:19:25,520
Yeah? When's my birthday?

183
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:27,894
August 24th.

184
00:19:29,902 --> 00:19:31,563
When's mine?

185
00:19:36,909 --> 00:19:38,342
Forget it.
Come on, man.

186
00:19:58,564 --> 00:20:01,328
[door opening]

187
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,129
- [door closing]
- [dog barking]

188
00:20:06,438 --> 00:20:08,531
[speaking Korean]

189
00:20:08,907 --> 00:20:10,534
[speaking Korean]

190
00:20:12,544 --> 00:20:14,068
[door shuts]

191
00:21:56,882 --> 00:22:00,181
- Are you checking me out?
- What?

192
00:22:00,252 --> 00:22:03,551
- There's no harm in it, if you just. . .
- Trust me,

193
00:22:03,622 --> 00:22:05,783
if l was checking you out,
you'd know it.

194
00:22:05,857 --> 00:22:08,189
Yeah? Then what
were you thinking, right now?

195
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:13,960
- l sure as hell wasn't thinking that.
- Don't stop to think. Just tell me.

196
00:22:16,768 --> 00:22:19,635
l was thinking that if we were
living at the caves,

197
00:22:19,705 --> 00:22:21,673
we could build a dam
around that spring

198
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:23,970
so that everybody
could have fresh water,

199
00:22:24,042 --> 00:22:26,636
and we could get the infirmary
off the beach.

200
00:22:27,412 --> 00:22:31,542
- You think it's a bad idea?
- No. No, it makes sense.

201
00:22:31,616 --> 00:22:33,140
But?

202
00:22:35,754 --> 00:22:38,450
- No ''but.''
- Good.

203
00:22:38,523 --> 00:22:41,686
A lot of people are still hoping
a rescue boat's gonna show up.

204
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:44,126
They aren't thinking
about their own safety.

205
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:46,664
We're gonna have
a lot of convincing to do.

206
00:22:46,732 --> 00:22:48,597
We?

207
00:22:48,667 --> 00:22:51,329
You still haven't convinced me yet.

208
00:23:06,585 --> 00:23:09,213
- Are you following me?
- Yes.

209
00:23:09,287 --> 00:23:11,619
There's no need.
l'm just going to the loo.

210
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:14,386
ls there something
you want to tell me, Charlie?

211
00:23:15,694 --> 00:23:19,687
- l'm going to the loo.
- lt's dangerous out there.

212
00:23:19,765 --> 00:23:22,791
Until we get back, l'm not
breaking line of sight with you.

213
00:23:22,868 --> 00:23:24,426
Bugger off.

214
00:23:24,503 --> 00:23:28,837
l know who you are,
and l know what you're looking for.

215
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:35,175
Drive Shaft.
You played bass.

216
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:37,681
And guitar.

217
00:23:37,749 --> 00:23:39,376
On a couple of tracks.

218
00:23:39,451 --> 00:23:42,079
- You've really heard of us?
- Because l'm over 40

219
00:23:42,154 --> 00:23:43,280
doesn't mean l'm deaf.

220
00:23:43,355 --> 00:23:45,255
l have both your albums.

221
00:23:45,323 --> 00:23:49,384
Although, l thought
that your self-titled debut

222
00:23:49,461 --> 00:23:51,929
was a much stronger effort
than <i>Oil Change.</i>

223
00:23:53,498 --> 00:23:55,625
lt's a shame
what happened to the band.

224
00:23:56,535 --> 00:24:00,096
- How long since you played?
- My guitar?

225
00:24:00,172 --> 00:24:04,370
Eight days, eleven hours.
Give or take.

226
00:24:04,443 --> 00:24:05,637
You miss it.

227
00:24:08,013 --> 00:24:10,880
Well, a lot of wreckage.
lt might still turn up.

228
00:24:10,949 --> 00:24:14,578
Undamaged? Still playable?
l don't think so.

229
00:24:14,653 --> 00:24:18,589
l wish, but there was this bloke
at the counter who made me check it in.

230
00:24:18,657 --> 00:24:19,646
- No.
- Yeah.

231
00:24:19,724 --> 00:24:22,921
There wasn't enough room in the cabin.
Fascist.

232
00:24:24,229 --> 00:24:25,992
You'll see it again.

233
00:24:26,665 --> 00:24:28,030
Oh, yeah?

234
00:24:28,099 --> 00:24:31,591
- What makes you say that?
- Because l have faith, Charlie.

235
00:24:45,116 --> 00:24:48,984
lt's about time.
l am dying of thirst.

236
00:24:52,924 --> 00:24:56,121
l think l'll let him sit in the sun
a while longer.

237
00:24:56,194 --> 00:25:01,097
Then l'll take his wife aside,
find some way to communicate.

238
00:25:01,166 --> 00:25:04,897
- She knows why he attacked Michael.
- Sure you don't want me to talk to her?

239
00:25:06,805 --> 00:25:08,739
lf you've got that
under control,

240
00:25:08,807 --> 00:25:11,207
l'm gonna talk to people
about the caves.

241
00:25:11,276 --> 00:25:14,575
l might be able to get a few
to go with me before nightfall,

242
00:25:14,646 --> 00:25:16,341
start setting up camp.

243
00:25:18,016 --> 00:25:20,314
You're serious?

244
00:25:23,788 --> 00:25:25,779
ls there a reason
you didn't consult us

245
00:25:25,857 --> 00:25:28,189
when you decided to form
your own civilization?

246
00:25:29,594 --> 00:25:31,619
l'm talking about
moving to the valley.

247
00:25:31,696 --> 00:25:34,028
What happened to
''live together, die alone''?

248
00:25:34,099 --> 00:25:36,567
Digging in together
is the only way we'll survive.

249
00:25:36,635 --> 00:25:39,968
Our best hope is in being spotted
by a plane or a ship.

250
00:25:40,038 --> 00:25:43,474
For that, we need to organize
to keep that signal fire burning

251
00:25:43,542 --> 00:25:47,945
while others scout for supplies.
Digging in anywhere else is suicide.

252
00:25:48,013 --> 00:25:50,982
lt is the only source of fresh water
we've found, Sayid.

253
00:25:51,049 --> 00:25:55,247
And staying on the beach in the sun,
without water, that's not suicide?

254
00:26:01,793 --> 00:26:04,057
l am not going to admit defeat.

255
00:26:29,387 --> 00:26:30,411
Now what?

256
00:26:30,488 --> 00:26:32,752
l already gave you
my statement, sheriff.

257
00:26:32,824 --> 00:26:35,793
l came to apologize.
l shouldn't have been suspicious.

258
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:38,055
You were the victim in the attack.

259
00:26:38,129 --> 00:26:40,597
l appreciate that.

260
00:26:40,665 --> 00:26:44,658
But l can tell you didn't come all the
way over here just to say you're sorry.

261
00:26:44,736 --> 00:26:47,569
People are considering
following Jack to the caves.

262
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:50,769
l'd like to know
where you stand.

263
00:26:50,842 --> 00:26:52,400
Right here.

264
00:26:52,477 --> 00:26:56,470
l got one priority, and that's
getting my kid off this island.

265
00:26:56,548 --> 00:27:00,006
A boat passes, l'm not gonna be
on the hook for missing it.

266
00:27:00,085 --> 00:27:01,780
Good.

267
00:27:05,824 --> 00:27:08,816
Slowly. Just a little bit at a time.
A little bit.

268
00:27:11,896 --> 00:27:13,591
Glad you're coming.

269
00:27:13,665 --> 00:27:17,624
Hey, man,
l go where the boar's at.

270
00:27:17,702 --> 00:27:21,297
So, what up with you and Kate?

271
00:27:21,373 --> 00:27:23,773
You guys gonna move
into a cave together?

272
00:27:23,842 --> 00:27:26,743
- Am l in high school?
- Well, that wasn't a denial.

273
00:27:26,811 --> 00:27:30,508
Just get your stuff together.
We gotta get out of here soon.

274
00:27:30,582 --> 00:27:34,177
Well, well, well,
if it ain't the belle of the ball.

275
00:27:36,955 --> 00:27:40,857
What's it like having the doctor
and Captain Falafel fighting over you?

276
00:27:42,894 --> 00:27:46,125
Just call 'em how l see 'em, freckles.

277
00:27:46,197 --> 00:27:50,031
Truth be told, l'm not the only one
wondering where you're gonna weigh in

278
00:27:50,101 --> 00:27:52,092
on this ''moving off the beach'' thing.

279
00:27:52,904 --> 00:27:57,000
Are you going with the pessimists,
or waiting for the rescue boats?

280
00:27:57,075 --> 00:28:00,169
- Are you going?
- Well, that's the real trick, isn't it?

281
00:28:00,245 --> 00:28:05,205
We all pack up stakes for the caves,
next day a plane passes by,

282
00:28:05,283 --> 00:28:07,717
they'll go on their way
and be none the wiser.

283
00:28:07,786 --> 00:28:10,346
On the other hand, stay here,

284
00:28:10,422 --> 00:28:13,687
get eaten by boars,
fall off a rock...

285
00:28:13,758 --> 00:28:16,727
...there's not gonna be anyone
to answer that 91 1 call.

286
00:28:17,829 --> 00:28:22,061
- You haven't answered my question.
- You didn't answer mine.

287
00:28:22,133 --> 00:28:24,226
And l asked first.

288
00:28:45,156 --> 00:28:47,750
[pounding]

289
00:28:51,996 --> 00:28:54,123
[grunting]

290
00:29:06,411 --> 00:29:09,471
[speaking Korean]

291
00:31:07,298 --> 00:31:09,892
[pounding]

292
00:31:18,877 --> 00:31:21,903
Great. Look who came to chat.

293
00:31:26,451 --> 00:31:28,112
l need to talk to you.

294
00:31:38,162 --> 00:31:40,062
You speak English?

295
00:31:40,131 --> 00:31:42,099
- Yes.
- Wait.

296
00:31:42,166 --> 00:31:44,896
You speak English?

297
00:31:46,671 --> 00:31:49,697
- Why didn't you say anything?
- My husband doesn't know.

298
00:31:49,774 --> 00:31:52,174
Why would you learn English
and not tell him?

299
00:31:52,243 --> 00:31:54,268
He has a bad temper.

300
00:31:54,946 --> 00:31:57,437
What my husband
did to you today,

301
00:31:58,116 --> 00:32:00,914
- it was a misunderstanding.
- No, l got it.

302
00:32:00,985 --> 00:32:03,749
- Loud and clear.
- lt was the watch.

303
00:32:03,821 --> 00:32:06,756
Your husband tried to murder me
for a watch?

304
00:32:06,824 --> 00:32:09,088
l found this watch
two days ago.

305
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:10,787
lt belongs to my father.

306
00:32:10,862 --> 00:32:14,525
Protecting that watch
is a question of honor.

307
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:16,794
Trying to kill me
in front of my kid is honor?

308
00:32:16,868 --> 00:32:18,563
You don't know my father.

309
00:32:20,571 --> 00:32:22,801
l need your help.

310
00:32:35,186 --> 00:32:38,781
Listen to me, you old git.
l'm going in the jungle.

311
00:32:38,856 --> 00:32:42,792
A man has...
a right to some privacy.

312
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:44,987
Just hand it to me.

313
00:32:46,397 --> 00:32:49,059
You're gonna run out.

314
00:32:49,133 --> 00:32:51,226
My guess is sooner
rather than later.

315
00:32:51,302 --> 00:32:54,465
Painful detox is inevitable.

316
00:32:54,539 --> 00:32:57,007
Give it up now.
At least it will be your choice.

317
00:32:59,110 --> 00:33:01,943
Don't talk to me like you
know something about me.

318
00:33:02,013 --> 00:33:04,345
l know a lot more about pain
than you think.

319
00:33:05,583 --> 00:33:09,610
l don't envy what you're facing,
but l want to help.

320
00:33:14,258 --> 00:33:15,657
Do you want your guitar?

321
00:33:27,338 --> 00:33:28,600
More than your drug?

322
00:33:28,673 --> 00:33:30,607
More than you know.

323
00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:34,634
What l know is that this island just
might give you what you're looking for,

324
00:33:34,712 --> 00:33:37,180
but you have to give
the island something.

325
00:33:56,868 --> 00:33:59,860
You really think
you can find my guitar?

326
00:34:01,873 --> 00:34:03,340
Look up, Charlie.

327
00:34:03,408 --> 00:34:06,536
You're not gonna ask me
to pray or something?

328
00:34:06,611 --> 00:34:08,238
l want you to look up.

329
00:34:26,030 --> 00:34:27,395
[Jack] Hey.

330
00:34:28,866 --> 00:34:30,663
lt's almost time to go.

331
00:34:33,671 --> 00:34:35,536
l don't want to be Eve.

332
00:34:38,709 --> 00:34:40,506
No one's asking you to.

333
00:34:41,245 --> 00:34:43,873
l just can't. . .

334
00:34:43,948 --> 00:34:46,280
- ...dig in.
- Why not?

335
00:34:46,350 --> 00:34:50,047
Someone else can stay here.
Keep a lookout. Wait for rescue.

336
00:34:50,121 --> 00:34:51,850
Why does it have to be you?

337
00:34:51,923 --> 00:34:54,448
- That's not it.
- Then what is it?

338
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:04,796
Kate, how did you
get to be this way?

339
00:35:06,037 --> 00:35:08,028
Just what is it that you did?

340
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:10,472
You had your chance to know.

341
00:35:20,685 --> 00:35:23,483
lf you need me,
you know where to find me.

342
00:35:30,328 --> 00:35:32,728
You know where
to find me too.

343
00:35:39,403 --> 00:35:43,601
l know you can't understand a word,
and l'm not the talking-out-loud type,

344
00:35:43,674 --> 00:35:48,077
but since l have a captive audience,
l hope for your sake you pay attention.

345
00:35:48,146 --> 00:35:51,013
l'm not exactly having
the best month of my life.

346
00:35:51,082 --> 00:35:54,108
l barely knew my son,
and now l gotta be his daddy.

347
00:35:54,185 --> 00:35:57,951
And then to top it off, l have a
deranged Korean guy trying to kill me,

348
00:35:58,022 --> 00:35:59,114
and for what?

349
00:36:00,458 --> 00:36:03,018
Look, l get it. All right?

350
00:36:03,094 --> 00:36:05,494
lt's the watch.
Mine broke.

351
00:36:05,563 --> 00:36:07,258
l found this in the wreckage,

352
00:36:07,331 --> 00:36:11,563
and l figured, hey, why let
a $20,000 watch go to waste?

353
00:36:11,636 --> 00:36:15,367
Which is ridiculous since time
doesn't matter on a damn island!

00:36:17,708 --> 00:36:19,300
Son of a. . .

355
00:36:25,416 --> 00:36:27,907

and l need that coffin to clear customs
