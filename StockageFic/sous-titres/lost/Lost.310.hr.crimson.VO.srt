1
00:00:16,266 --> 00:00:17,851
Wash away my troubles

2
00:00:17,935 --> 00:00:19,686
wash away my pain

3
00:00:19,811 --> 00:00:23,190
with the rain of Shambala

4
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:25,317
wash away my sorrow

5
00:00:25,442 --> 00:00:27,277
wash away my shame

6
00:00:27,402 --> 00:00:30,906
with the rain of Shambala...

7
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:33,290
You got this thing running yet, buddy ?

8
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:36,230
Nah, but I got your tools all set.

9
00:00:36,310 --> 00:00:38,680
See if we can get this
thing started, okay ?

10
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:41,250
I thought we needed
a new carburetor.

11
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:42,900
Well, maybe we don't.

12
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:44,460
Come on. Slide behind the wheel.

13
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:46,030
We'll fire this up.

14
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:55,780
What's the matter ? Go ahead.

15
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:13,320
this is stupid.

16
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:15,910
Without a new carburetor,
it's not gonna work.

17
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:18,340
Having hope is never stupid.

18
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:21,580
You gotta believe good things will
happen, and then they will.

19
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:23,200
Understand what I'm saying ?

20
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:28,570
In this world, son, you gotta
make your own luck.

21
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:30,820
All right ?

22
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:32,180
Come on.

23
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:39,160
Well, what do you want to fix today ?

24
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,290
we're gonna have to put that
on hold for a little while,

25
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:47,240
'cause, uh, I gotta go to vegas.

26
00:01:47,290 --> 00:01:49,370
You know, I got some work out there.

27
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:51,100
W-what about the road trip ?

28
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:54,720
Well, the grand canyon will still be
there when I get back, little dude.

29
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:56,950
hey, I got something for you.

30
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:00,920
I'm...  not supposed to. Mom says.

31
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:01,990
Live a little, Hugo.

32
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:04,180
It's just a cay bar, okay ?

33
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,190
All right.

34
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:10,020
I'll be back before you know it,
all right ?

35
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:11,310
- All right.
- Hold down the fort ?

36
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:13,300
You're my man ? All right.

37
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:01,670
so then the others take
the bags f our heads,

38
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:04,230
and we're, like,n the other
side of the island...

39
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:07,780
and they take Jack, Kate
and Sawyer someplace,

40
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:12,840
and they sent me back to warn
everyone to stay away...

41
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:17,650
which I did...
and now everyone's freaked out.

42
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:22,410
With them gone,
and what happened to Eko,

43
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:30,880
they're all scared...  and I'm scared.

44
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:39,010
But then I've...  been scared most
of my time here,anyway...

45
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:48,130
except when I'm with you.

46
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:54,130
I miss you, libby.

47
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,500
Bloody hell.

48
00:04:18,830 --> 00:04:19,960
Dude, you okay ?

49
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:21,200
Peachy.

50
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,680
Really ?

51
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:24,130
'Cause you've kinda been
moping the last...

52
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,570
look, it's not worth talking
about, Hurley, okay ?

53
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:28,460
Dude, you can tell me anything.

54
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:35,050
Desmond...

55
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:38,110
said I was gonna die.

56
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:40,540
He...  he... he told me
he has these flashes...

57
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,000
visions, whatever...

58
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:44,100
and in them, I always die.

59
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:54,270
So this is the part where you
tell me, "it's ridiculous.

60
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:55,480
Don't be daft.

61
00:04:55,530 --> 00:04:57,250
He's a nutter.

62
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:59,680
" I think he might be right...

63
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:01,870
and I think it might be my fault.

64
00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:03,870
Your fault ?

65
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:07,050
I'm... kind a cursed.

66
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:10,340
Death finds me, dude.

67
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:18,430
Vincent ?

68
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:22,240
Is that an arm ?

69
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:28,640
Here, Vincent.

70
00:05:28,670 --> 00:05:30,060
Come here, Vincent.

71
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:31,760
I think we need to get that.

72
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:35,210
Yeah, chase the dog with the skeletal
arm into the creepy jungle.

73
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,470
You be my guest.

74
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:37,870
Uh, okay.

75
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:40,370
If I'm not back in three hours,
tell somebody.

76
00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:47,420
Vincent !

77
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:52,760
Vincent, come here !

78
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:06,780
Vincent !

79
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:34,310
Vincent.

80
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:52,000
awesome.

84
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:12,910
it's everyone's fantasy...
winning the lottery...

85
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:16,260
untold millions falling
into your lap overnight.

86
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:18,520
What would you do with
all that money ?

87
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:22,920
Well, one such lucky winner
recently bought a chicken shack.

88
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:25,270
I'm Tricia Tanaka with Hugo Reyes,

89
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:29,050
winner of a record $114 million,

90
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:32,120
outside Mr. Cluck's chicken
shack in diamond bar,

91
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,170
which will be having its
grand reopening tomorrow.

92
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:37,890
So, Hugo, I think the question
on everyone's mind

93
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:40,650
is why did you buy Mr. Cluck's ?

94
00:07:40,910 --> 00:07:45,900
Uh... I like chicken.

95
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:52,630
Um, also with us is, uh,
Hugo's former boss

96
00:07:52,670 --> 00:07:55,580
and now employee, randy nations.

97
00:07:55,610 --> 00:07:58,580
That's probably every
working stiff's fantasy,

98
00:07:58,610 --> 00:08:00,340
isn't it, Mr. Reyes ?

99
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:06,590
Um, okay, so, Hugo, tell us
what else you've done

100
00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:08,910
since you got on your lucky streak.

101
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:12,210
Actually, I've kind of had
some bad luck, too.

102
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:15,450
My, uh, grandpa tito died
of a heart attack,

103
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:18,110
and the first house I bought
my mom burnt down.

104
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,010
My friend Johnny ran off with
my girlfriend starla...

105
00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:22,400
oh, and this guy jumped off
my accountant's roof.

106
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:23,860
Cut.

107
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:26,420
what the hell was that ?

108
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:29,000
It's a puff piece, Mr. Reyes.

109
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,710
Do you know what that is ?

110
00:08:31,570 --> 00:08:33,280
Yeah.

111
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:35,920
Sorry, Tricia Tanaka.

112
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:40,010
Um, uh, do you mind if we go
inside and, uh, shoot some b-roll ?

113
00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:41,160
Oh, I don't know...

114
00:08:41,210 --> 00:08:42,780
yeah, yeah, yeah. Of course you can.

115
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:43,950
Oh, he's just superstitious.

116
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,190
You know, the ribbon isn't cut yet.

117
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:48,150
okay, let's go.

118
00:08:48,210 --> 00:08:50,310
Ugh ! God, I hate this.

119
00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:51,810
I always get the stupid stories.

120
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:53,720
Hey, you sure it's okay ?

121
00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:55,560
Yeah, relax.

122
00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:55,750
The safety guards are on the fryers ?

123
00:08:55,790 --> 00:08:57,940
Dude, those fryers are stone-cold.
All right ?

124
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,370
We don't even start cooking
till tomorrow.

125
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:00,980
You hear something ?

126
00:09:02,770 --> 00:09:04,490
and then pan through the...

127
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,880
well, we are out of dharma oat bars.

128
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,970
Already ? Yep.

129
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:00,760
Did you check behind the powdered milk ?

130
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:03,600
Will you pass me the box of cereal ?

131
00:10:03,650 --> 00:10:05,690
then I guess we're out of them.

132
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:10,160
Will you... pass me... the cereal ?

133
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,490
how is that possible ?

134
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:14,330
from now on, I will only
speak to you in english.

135
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:15,750
It's how you will learn.

136
00:10:18,570 --> 00:10:19,850
it will be hard at first...

137
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:25,660
everyone, hey !

138
00:10:25,690 --> 00:10:27,060
Hurley, what is it ?

139
00:10:27,130 --> 00:10:28,710
is it the others ?

140
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:29,530
Are you okay ?

141
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:31,010
what's going on, man ?

142
00:10:31,450 --> 00:10:35,630
Car. I found a car...

143
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,520
tipped over in the jungle.

144
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,690
You found A...  car.

145
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:42,990
And we can totally fix it
and get it going again.

146
00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:44,840
It's not far. Come on.

147
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:47,480
Why do we need to start a car ?

148
00:10:47,570 --> 00:10:50,490
Because it'll be fun.

149
00:10:51,710 --> 00:10:54,090
Oh. We could all use some fun.

150
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:57,300
I mean, after everything
that's happened, we need it.

151
00:10:58,910 --> 00:11:00,900
Especially you, dude.

152
00:11:02,010 --> 00:11:03,960
So who's with me ?

153
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:08,920
Well, I... gotta get
some bananas. Sorry.

154
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:10,680
I don't think so, Hurley.

155
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,120
sorry, Hurley.

156
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:17,920
Come on ! Anyone ?
We're gonna drive it !

157
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:19,840
Who's coming ?

158
00:11:28,690 --> 00:11:30,210
Thanks, dude.

159
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,870
you have no idea what you
volunteered for, do you ?

160
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:41,320
Come on.

161
00:11:42,070 --> 00:11:43,910
are we there yet ?

162
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:47,310
If we are where I think we are,

163
00:11:47,590 --> 00:11:49,490
then our beach should be
just through those trees.

164
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:51,470
We'll be home in about five minutes.

165
00:11:51,810 --> 00:11:54,000
Try to contain your excitement,
freckles.

166
00:11:54,050 --> 00:11:56,180
Forgive me if I'm not excited
about explaining

167
00:11:56,230 --> 00:11:58,880
why there's only two
of us coming back, James.

168
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:02,060
Well, maybe they should explain
why they ain't come looking for us.

169
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:06,450
In fact, I'd be
surprised if loc... ow !

170
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:07,650
Aah ! What happened ?

171
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:08,810
Stepped on something. Son of a bitch !

172
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:11,940
Looks like A...  dart.

173
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:13,420
How the hell did it get out here ?

174
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:15,170
All right, just relax your
foot for a second, okay ?

175
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,960
I'm gonna pull it out. on the
count of three. You ready ?

176
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:20,830
One...  ow !

177
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:22,400
I thought you said three.

178
00:12:22,430 --> 00:12:24,530
Yeah, well, anticipation's the worst part.

179
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,220
I thought I would spare you.

180
00:12:36,350 --> 00:12:39,110
You know, all you have
to do is say sorry.

181
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:43,870
We could start again, give
each other a clean slate.

182
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:48,210
Slate...  like on "little house" ?

183
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:49,690
What ?

184
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:51,670
"Little house on the prairie" ?

185
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:54,120
Laura Ingalls used to write on
this little chalkboard at school ?

186
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:56,240
You call it "little house" ?

187
00:12:57,740 --> 00:12:59,720
I had mono when I was a kid.

188
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:00,570
I missed two months of school.

189
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:03,310
We only got one channel in my trailer.

190
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:07,740
What are we even talking about ?

191
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:14,210
Ah, we ain't talking about nothing.

192
00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:16,280
James...

193
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:19,000
and I ain't got nothing
to be sorry for.

194
00:13:21,330 --> 00:13:23,630
So that's how it's gonna be ?

195
00:13:27,730 --> 00:13:29,960
Welcome home, Sawyer.

196
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:37,090
welcome home, Kate.

197
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:40,120
Hugo, is that you, Hugo ?

198
00:14:41,270 --> 00:14:42,930
Oh, my god.

199
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:44,930
What happened ?

200
00:14:44,970 --> 00:14:47,320
- Tricia Tanaka's dead.
- What ?

201
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:53,160
Mr. Cluck's... it got hit by
a meteor... or an asteroid...

202
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:57,170
I don't know the difference,
but it's gone.

203
00:14:57,190 --> 00:14:58,250
That's crazy.

204
00:14:58,270 --> 00:14:59,150
It's not crazy.

205
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,210
It's the lottery money.

206
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:01,210
The numbers... I'm cursed.

207
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:04,890
And now Tricia Tanaka's dead, and her
camera dude, and it's all my fault.

208
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:06,810
Ow ! It was an accident.

209
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:08,650
It's not an accident.

210
00:15:08,690 --> 00:15:09,830
It is a curse.

211
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:11,230
There's only one way to stop it.

212
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:12,320
I have to go to Australia.

213
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:13,730
Again with Australia ?

214
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,720
That's where the numbers came from.

215
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:18,200
Lenny in the institution...
he told me.

216
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:20,780
Hugo, Hugo, wait.

217
00:15:20,830 --> 00:15:24,420
I can prove to you you're not cursed.

218
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:26,980
You can ? Yes.

219
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:28,430
Come here with me.

220
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:31,030
I-I have to show you something.

221
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:35,070
Hey, Hugo !

222
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:42,600
After 17 years, your father has returned.

223
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,980
Hey, wow.

224
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:47,670
Your mom wasn't kidding
about those candy bars.

225
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:49,480
just kidding.

226
00:15:54,330 --> 00:15:58,990
Poor... Roger.

227
00:16:00,030 --> 00:16:02,320
Sorry about your arm, dude.

228
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:07,100
Hurley !

229
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:10,800
In. In.

230
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:11,760
Totally.

231
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:13,600
Let's check it out.

232
00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:22,350
Dude, Roger was on a beer run.

233
00:16:26,890 --> 00:16:28,820
oh, man, I suck at charades.
You want to what ?

234
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:35,800
oh, you wanna take Roger out...

235
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:38,080
then and turn it over ?

236
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:40,520
Cool. I understand !

237
00:16:45,730 --> 00:16:47,820
Okay, on three.

238
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:55,810
One... two... three.

239
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:07,520
we'll get that later.

240
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:17,900
So when's it gonna happen ?

241
00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:22,140
When's what gonna happen ?

242
00:17:22,190 --> 00:17:23,790
Don't play stupid with me...

243
00:17:23,830 --> 00:17:25,580
brother.

244
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:30,770
I was drunk.

245
00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:31,490
You know, if I said anything...

246
00:17:31,530 --> 00:17:34,350
I have a right to know
when I'm gonna die.

247
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:37,010
It doesn't work like that.

248
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:38,590
What doesn't work like that ?

249
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:40,580
Hey, Oliver Twist.

250
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:43,460
Where the hell's my stuff ?

251
00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:44,260
What stuff ?

252
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:46,460
Oh, you know good and
damn well what stuff.

253
00:17:46,510 --> 00:17:49,260
I had books, food, porno,
a bottle of scotch.

254
00:17:49,290 --> 00:17:52,360
Aye, apologies for the scotch, mate.

255
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:55,290
You drank it ?!

256
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:57,390
Well, to be fair, there was, uh...

257
00:17:57,420 --> 00:17:59,380
there was three of us.

258
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:01,890
Yeah, there was.

259
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:04,210
You, the munchkin and who else ?

260
00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:12,620
oh, I got it.

261
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:14,390
We're gonna tip it up.

262
00:18:14,430 --> 00:18:16,210
Crafty.

263
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:18,000
crafty ?

264
00:18:18,050 --> 00:18:19,330
Yeah, crafty.

265
00:18:19,370 --> 00:18:23,790
It's like...  when you're
good at... crafts.

266
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:26,510
Never mind.

267
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:29,390
Hey, where the hell's my stuff ?

268
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:30,760
What are y'all doing ?

269
00:18:30,790 --> 00:18:32,920
Dude ! You're alive !

270
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,550
Alive !

271
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:37,840
yeah, yeah, snuffy.

272
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:40,060
It's good to see you, too.

273
00:18:40,270 --> 00:18:42,540
I'll be damn. Y'all found
yourselves a hippie car.

274
00:18:42,590 --> 00:18:43,600
Pretty cool, huh ?

275
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:45,410
Sawyer. Jin-bo.

276
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:47,870
how you doing ?

277
00:18:48,130 --> 00:18:50,580
Good... see you.

278
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:51,810
Well, look at that.

279
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:54,030
Somebody's hooked on phonics.

280
00:18:54,090 --> 00:18:55,320
What about Jack and Kate ?

281
00:18:55,350 --> 00:18:56,720
They with you ? They all right ?

282
00:18:56,780 --> 00:18:58,600
Kate's with me...

283
00:18:58,670 --> 00:19:00,660
but the Doc...

284
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,720
they still got him.

285
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:04,310
Okay, it's okay.

286
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:04,900
It's gonna be all right.

287
00:19:04,930 --> 00:19:06,930
Jack's gonna be all right. We all are.

288
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:08,860
Well, what a relief.

289
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:10,500
Nah, see, things are getting better.

290
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:13,620
The car, you coming back safely...
it's a sign.

291
00:19:13,650 --> 00:19:15,630
Yeah, a sign I want my stuff back.

292
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:19,090
You're gonna help us fix this thing.

293
00:19:19,150 --> 00:19:21,360
And why in the hell would I do that ?

294
00:19:21,970 --> 00:19:24,040
'Cause there's beer.

295
00:19:26,330 --> 00:19:28,050
Why did he say, "don't come back" ?

296
00:19:28,090 --> 00:19:30,270
He sacrificed himself so we could escape.

297
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:32,510
Probably didn't want
it to be for nothing.

298
00:19:32,810 --> 00:19:35,290
Hurley told us they released
Michael and walt.

299
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:37,370
Yep. They gave Michael a boat.

300
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:39,080
They took off and never looked back.

301
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:40,930
Did you see any other boats ?

302
00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:44,250
No, but something tells me they
didn't give away their only one.

303
00:19:46,330 --> 00:19:48,360
So they can leave the island ?

304
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:50,090
I don't know, John.

305
00:19:50,130 --> 00:19:54,040
This "zoo" where they held you...
is that where they live ?

306
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:57,350
We escaped with one of them...
a kid named Karl.

307
00:19:57,390 --> 00:19:59,420
He said that they live on this island.

308
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:01,640
He could've taken us there,
but Sawyer let him go.

309
00:20:01,670 --> 00:20:02,680
Why ?

310
00:20:02,710 --> 00:20:04,970
You're gonna have to ask Sawyer.

311
00:20:05,510 --> 00:20:06,360
Kate, where are you going ?

312
00:20:06,410 --> 00:20:08,310
I don't care what Jack said.

313
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:10,940
They've got him, and
we have to get him back.

314
00:20:10,990 --> 00:20:14,640
I owe him that...
so I'm going to get help.

315
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:17,390
Help from who ?

316
00:20:23,270 --> 00:20:25,430
Now that's a hell of a Jesus.

317
00:20:25,450 --> 00:20:28,510
Yes. Hugo is such a good son.

318
00:20:28,550 --> 00:20:30,880
He knows of my love for the savior,

319
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:35,590
so he commissioned artisans in
taxco to custom carve for me

320
00:20:35,630 --> 00:20:38,080
this statue in solid gold.

321
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:42,550
Wow, that smells like great lasagna.

322
00:20:42,570 --> 00:20:44,830
The Trons made it themselves.

323
00:20:45,690 --> 00:20:48,080
Hugo found them in bennigan'S.

324
00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:50,330
Now they are our butlers.

325
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:54,010
Something wrong, Hugo ?

326
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:57,660
Your father asked you
a question, Hugo.

327
00:20:58,390 --> 00:21:00,300
My father ?

328
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:02,290
You're acting like he never left us,

329
00:21:02,330 --> 00:21:04,760
like he hasn't been gone for 17 years.

330
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:06,250
And all of a sudden he shows up ?

331
00:21:06,290 --> 00:21:08,530
Aren't you at least
a little suspicious ?

332
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:11,900
I showed up because your mom
called and said you were in trouble.

333
00:21:12,270 --> 00:21:13,300
What ?!

334
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:15,810
All these numbers and curs.

335
00:21:15,850 --> 00:21:17,830
Hugo, I don't know what
to do anymore.

336
00:21:17,870 --> 00:21:19,870
I thought you needed a manly influence,

337
00:21:19,890 --> 00:21:22,730
a father to get you
to stop this nonsense.

338
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:24,110
I'm not crazy !

339
00:21:24,130 --> 00:21:27,370
And the only reason he's back
is 'cause he wants the money.

340
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:28,540
Oh, now that hurts.

341
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:29,430
Well, guess what ?

342
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:31,010
There isn't gonna be any money.

343
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:33,940
Ha ! Mr. Tron, lady Tron.

344
00:21:33,990 --> 00:21:36,210
Your services will no longer be needed.

345
00:21:36,310 --> 00:21:37,520
Severance.

346
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:39,130
Trust me, I'm doing you a huge favor.

347
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:41,560
It's only a matter of time
before the curse gets you,

348
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:44,820
and you...  die, or worse.

349
00:21:44,990 --> 00:21:46,870
Hugo, what are you doing ?

350
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:49,250
Getting rid of it, all of it...
the money,

351
00:21:49,290 --> 00:21:52,480
the houses, the livestock...
and I'm starting with him.

352
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:53,280
No, Hugo.

353
00:21:53,330 --> 00:21:54,630
Your father is staying with us.

354
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:56,370
Staying with us ? Where ?

355
00:21:57,250 --> 00:21:59,730
It's been 17 years, Hugo.

356
00:21:59,770 --> 00:22:01,860
What's been 17 years ?

357
00:22:06,630 --> 00:22:08,870
I have needs.

358
00:22:11,290 --> 00:22:13,930
No, no, no !

359
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:14,980
This can't be happening !

360
00:22:15,010 --> 00:22:17,570
He has to go ! He has to !
I want him gone !

361
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,450
No, you don't.

362
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:19,660
Yeah, I do.

363
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:23,390
Why don't you show your father
what you have in the garage, Hugo ?

364
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:37,870
I can't believe it.

365
00:22:39,110 --> 00:22:45,610
You saved it. you saved it.

366
00:23:05,690 --> 00:23:07,970
me first now. Come on.

367
00:23:08,910 --> 00:23:11,130
What's up with all this recycling ?

368
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:13,000
you got me, dude.

369
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:19,500
Looks like those dharma freaks were
building some sort of dirt road.

370
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:22,820
Whoo ! Ha ha ! Now we're talkin'.

371
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:23,590
Hugo...

372
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:28,690
looks good to me.

373
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:29,910
Engine's fine, right ?

374
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:33,830
Son of...
what's a head doing back here ?

375
00:23:33,850 --> 00:23:35,660
Oh, that's just Roger.

376
00:23:37,490 --> 00:23:40,050
I'm gonna start the car now !

377
00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:47,310
dude, even if you were
speaking english,

378
00:23:47,350 --> 00:23:49,350
I wouldn't understand
a word you're saying.

379
00:23:49,390 --> 00:23:52,240
Just relax. We're good. This'll work.

380
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:57,330
I have hope.

381
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:00,350
This will work.

382
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:13,760
damn it.

383
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:23,720
It's flat, and it stinks.

384
00:24:23,970 --> 00:24:25,630
Can you get it to work ?
Do you know what's wrong ?

385
00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:27,640
Chill out. Let the man do his thing.

386
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:31,380
Dude, that beer's been sitting
there since before "Rocky III,

387
00:24:31,450 --> 00:24:33,960
" maybe even "ii. " It's
probably poison by now.

388
00:24:34,070 --> 00:24:36,040
Skeletor seems to like it.

389
00:24:36,070 --> 00:24:37,260
Bottoms up.

390
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:38,590
That's not cool, dude.

391
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:42,330
That guy had a mom, a family and friends.

392
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:43,580
Oh, and a name.

393
00:24:43,610 --> 00:24:46,080
Not skeletor... it's Roger Workman.

394
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:49,580
It's work man, you blockhead.

395
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:50,860
That's his job.

396
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:52,590
He was a dharma janitor.

397
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:54,990
Yeah, well you should
still respect the dead.

398
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:00,140
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Can you fix it ?

399
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:03,100
No. No fix.

400
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:08,970
but you have to.

401
00:25:09,530 --> 00:25:10,860
I mean, can't you try, dude ?

402
00:25:10,890 --> 00:25:12,160
I mean, we gotta get this running.

403
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:15,540
Hey, leave the man alone.
He's right. "No fix.

404
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:16,950
" Take a look at that mess.

405
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:18,370
There's no way it's gonna get running.

406
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:19,520
How thick are you ?

407
00:25:19,550 --> 00:25:21,230
What's your problem, man ?

408
00:25:21,290 --> 00:25:22,780
Why--why don't you want this to work ?

409
00:25:22,810 --> 00:25:24,110
I don't care if it works.

410
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:25,410
Why is it so important to you ?

411
00:25:25,430 --> 00:25:27,540
Because we could all use a little hope.

412
00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:31,170
If it's hope you're looking for,
ese, you're on the wrong damn islan.

413
00:25:32,010 --> 00:25:34,570
'cause there sure as hell
ain't no hope here.

414
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:48,690
Come on, Hugo, time to get up.

415
00:25:48,730 --> 00:25:51,950
Come on ! Rise and shine. Hit the deck.

416
00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:53,980
Come on, we're burning
daylight. Let's go.

417
00:25:55,380 --> 00:25:57,540
what's with the earphones ?

418
00:25:57,810 --> 00:25:59,270
It's for the noise.

419
00:25:59,330 --> 00:26:02,120
Oh, well, your mother's a
very passionate woman.

420
00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:03,940
That is disgusting.

421
00:26:03,970 --> 00:26:06,200
Come on. We're going on
an adventure. Let's go.

422
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:07,800
I'm not going anywhere with you.

423
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:10,540
look, just do this one thing with me.

424
00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:13,070
If it doesn't work,
you can go to Australia.

425
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:15,270
I won't stop you. Okay ?

426
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:18,360
What one thing ?

427
00:26:18,990 --> 00:26:21,040
We're gonna break the curse.

428
00:26:22,930 --> 00:26:24,660
This is stupid.

429
00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:27,350
Just give her a chance, man.

430
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:31,460
Cut the deck, please.

431
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:43,780
You've recently come into
a great deal of money.

432
00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:45,730
Could've seen that on the news.

433
00:26:49,670 --> 00:26:51,930
But it hasn't brought you happiness.

434
00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:55,770
No, it's brought you great misfortune.

435
00:26:57,210 --> 00:26:59,410
She didn't see that on the news.

436
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:02,210
I'm seeing numbers.

437
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:03,420
What numbers ?

438
00:27:03,470 --> 00:27:11,040
4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42.

439
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:15,710
There's darkness
around these numbers...

440
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:19,030
great tragedy.

441
00:27:24,030 --> 00:27:26,620
I'm... I'm sorry.

442
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:28,910
What ? What is it ?

443
00:27:29,780 --> 00:27:33,220
Death... surrounds you...

444
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:37,280
and more is coming.

445
00:27:38,910 --> 00:27:41,610
Your hands, please.

446
00:27:43,750 --> 00:27:45,980
There's a curse on you...

447
00:27:47,430 --> 00:27:49,920
but it can be removed.

448
00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:55,930
Now, Hugo, I need you
to remove your clothes.

449
00:27:58,350 --> 00:28:00,080
My clothes ?

450
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:03,830
A curse is like an unwelcome
entity that lives inside you,

451
00:28:05,740 --> 00:28:08,620
and it must be exorcised.

452
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:17,520
did my dad put you up to this ?

453
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:20,120
What ?

454
00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:22,230
Hugo, please.

455
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:24,580
I'll give you $1,000
right now if you admit

456
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:26,040
that my dad told you to say this stuff.

457
00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:28,620
The mystic arts are not
subject to bribes.

458
00:28:28,770 --> 00:28:30,460
How dare you... $10,000.

459
00:28:30,470 --> 00:28:32,500
Your dad put me up to it.

460
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,670
I was just trying to help.

461
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:46,780
Help who ?

462
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:57,930
Beer. Beer.

463
00:28:58,010 --> 00:29:00,060
Bingo. Beautiful.

464
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:06,550
Car. Car.

465
00:29:07,490 --> 00:29:11,370
Okay international house of pancakes.

466
00:29:13,050 --> 00:29:15,230
What are you doing over there ?

467
00:29:15,670 --> 00:29:16,920
I'm praying.

468
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:18,400
Praying for what ?

469
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:19,820
Help.

470
00:29:19,850 --> 00:29:23,240
Well, hell, I got you
a little help right here.

471
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:37,400
Du ! Hey, dude.

472
00:29:37,420 --> 00:29:39,040
Stop moping. Come on.

473
00:29:39,650 --> 00:29:42,560
I'm not moping. I'm thinking.

474
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:46,160
When people stare out at the
ocean and get all quiet-like,

475
00:29:46,170 --> 00:29:47,230
they're moping.

476
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:48,870
So get up and come with me.

477
00:29:48,890 --> 00:29:51,610
That car I found...
we're getting it running.

478
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:53,730
What's the point ?

479
00:29:54,610 --> 00:29:56,630
Ow ! What did you do that for ?

480
00:29:56,670 --> 00:29:57,640
Snap out of it.

481
00:29:57,650 --> 00:30:00,890
Stop feeling sorry for yourself
'cause someone said you're gonna die.

482
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:03,610
I got an idea that's gonna help us both.

483
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:07,130
Now...  it is dangerous,

484
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:09,800
and there's a very good
chance that you will die.

485
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:12,410
This is supposed to convince
me to come with you ?

486
00:30:12,430 --> 00:30:16,800
It is, 'cause if you don't
die, then we win.

487
00:30:16,830 --> 00:30:17,650
Win ?

488
00:30:17,660 --> 00:30:18,440
Look, I don't know about you,

489
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:21,300
but things have really
sucked for me lately,

490
00:30:21,330 --> 00:30:23,270
and I could really use a victory.

491
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:24,940
So let's get one, dude.

492
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,780
Let's get this car started.

493
00:30:26,810 --> 00:30:29,090
Let's look death in the face
and say, "whatever, man.

494
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:30,970
" Let's make our own luck.

495
00:30:31,030 --> 00:30:32,910
What do you say ?

496
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:40,130
I'm sorry.

497
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:43,950
I'm sorry.

498
00:30:44,890 --> 00:30:46,810
Okay, nice. Keep it coming.

499
00:30:46,830 --> 00:30:53,120
Uh... you... were... right.

500
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:57,450
Okay. That's two. Hit me.

501
00:30:58,420 --> 00:31:04,100
Those pants don't make you look fat.

502
00:31:04,850 --> 00:31:09,070
now you got it... the only
three things a woman needs to hear.

503
00:31:09,650 --> 00:31:12,630
come on, get up. We got work to do.

504
00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:14,440
What's your problem, Jumbotron ?

505
00:31:14,850 --> 00:31:18,400
Shut up, red... neck... man.

506
00:31:19,930 --> 00:31:21,790
Touche.

507
00:31:22,290 --> 00:31:24,180
What's Jimy Cricket doing here ?

508
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:25,440
We need another man.

509
00:31:25,470 --> 00:31:26,730
Another man for what ?

510
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:28,340
To push this car, dude.

511
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:30,180
Push it ? Push it where ?

512
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:40,490
go, go, go, go.

513
00:32:10,870 --> 00:32:13,400
oh, this is gonna be real good.

514
00:32:17,050 --> 00:32:19,170
So you're going to Australia, huh ?

515
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:23,620
Long way to go 'cause
some stupid numbers...

516
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:25,670
I'd really like you to leave.

517
00:32:27,610 --> 00:32:29,980
When your mom called me
about the lottery,

518
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:33,150
I was on my bike before
she could hang the phone up.

519
00:32:35,150 --> 00:32:36,640
I'm getting old.

520
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:40,260
Yeah, I-I saw my retirement.

521
00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:44,600
You're right.

522
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:47,800
I'm here for the money.

523
00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:51,490
Well, you're not getting any of it.

524
00:32:51,510 --> 00:32:54,860
Well, that's not why I'm here
talking to you now.

525
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:57,300
I'm here talking to you now because

526
00:32:57,330 --> 00:33:00,400
going to Australia's not
gonna break any curse.

527
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:02,900
You don't need to leave.

528
00:33:02,930 --> 00:33:06,990
You just... you need a little hope.

529
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:11,260
We make our own luck, Hugo.

530
00:33:13,030 --> 00:33:15,200
You know what
I think you should do ?

531
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:17,010
What ?

532
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:20,190
I think you should
give away the money...

533
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:22,690
all of it, every penny.

534
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:27,630
Just save enough for a...
a carburetor.

535
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:33,390
Work on the camaro, you know,
just you and me.

536
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:38,490
Take it off the blocks and make
that road trip to the grand canyon.

537
00:33:42,430 --> 00:33:44,920
Never too late for a fresh start.

538
00:33:54,050 --> 00:33:56,360
I'll send you a postcard from Sydney.

539
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:05,550
Hey... I'll be here
when you get back.

540
00:34:12,020 --> 00:34:13,470
Are you nuts ?

541
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:15,920
You're not gonna drive down that.

542
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:19,060
We're gonna jump-start it.

543
00:34:19,510 --> 00:34:21,290
You guys are gonna push it,
and then on the way down,

544
00:34:21,310 --> 00:34:23,650
I'm gonna pop the clutch
and get it started.

545
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:25,310
You see those rocks ?

546
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:28,320
All you're gonna do is crash
into those real fast,

547
00:34:28,350 --> 00:34:29,830
if you don't roll over first.

548
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:31,700
Hurley, no.

549
00:34:31,740 --> 00:34:33,900
Dudes, I know how to drive.

550
00:34:34,420 --> 00:34:37,130
Now come on. Just push me.
This will work. I know it.

551
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:39,730
And what are you out here for...

552
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:41,720
watch him crash and burn ?

553
00:34:45,910 --> 00:34:48,020
I came to ride shotgun.

554
00:34:56,610 --> 00:34:58,800
Well, it's your funeral.

555
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:01,470
Come on. Let's give 'em their ride.

556
00:35:04,610 --> 00:35:06,630
Are you sure you want to do this ?

557
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:10,520
Victory or death.

558
00:35:18,090 --> 00:35:19,970
Push !

559
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:44,370
whoa ! Whoa, jeez ! Careful now.

560
00:35:45,910 --> 00:35:47,590
Here we go.

561
00:35:58,370 --> 00:36:00,490
Now would be a good time, Hurley.

562
00:36:01,550 --> 00:36:02,730
Like right now !

563
00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:04,010
There is no curse.

564
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:04,690
You make your own luck.

565
00:36:04,710 --> 00:36:05,940
Hurley !

566
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:07,590
You make your own luck.

567
00:36:07,650 --> 00:36:09,110
There is no curse !

568
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:38,690
son of a bitch.

569
00:36:38,930 --> 00:36:40,980
Hurley !

570
00:39:55,250 --> 00:39:58,670
Kate, if you were looking
for help to find Jack,

571
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:00,150
why didn't you ask us ?

572
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:01,740
Two reasons...
you don't know where to look,

573
00:40:01,770 --> 00:40:03,560
and you're not motivated.

574
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:05,320
And I don't blame you.

575
00:40:05,510 --> 00:40:07,640
Why would you want to go on
another trek across the island,

576
00:40:07,660 --> 00:40:09,580
risk more lives just to get Jack back ?

577
00:40:08,430 --> 00:40:09,200
You're wrong.

578
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:11,350
Oh, really ?
Then why didn't you come after...

579
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:14,420
not about the motivation,
just about knowing where to look.

580
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:16,110
We got a compass bearing,

581
00:40:16,150 --> 00:40:19,720
and I'm pretty sure if we follow it,
it'll lead us right to him.

582
00:40:19,740 --> 00:40:20,490
How ?

583
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:24,770
Because of theay the sunlight hit
Mr. Eko's stick when John was burying him.

584
00:40:27,350 --> 00:40:28,470
So now you know our secret.

585
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:30,150
How about you tell us yours ?

586
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:34,030
No ! Don't shoot ! ...

587
00:40:34,710 --> 00:40:36,950
It's all right ! It's safe !

588
00:40:36,970 --> 00:40:38,910
We're just here to talk !

589
00:40:40,670 --> 00:40:42,650
You can come out !

590
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:09,480
What are you doing here ?

591
00:41:10,950 --> 00:41:13,010
I came to ask for your help

592
00:41:14,330 --> 00:41:16,300
to do what ?

593
00:41:17,070 --> 00:41:18,530
I'm heading to the others' camp,

594
00:41:18,550 --> 00:41:20,000
and if I'm gonna find it,

595
00:41:20,030 --> 00:41:22,180
I need someone who knows the island.

596
00:41:23,030 --> 00:41:26,190
What makes you think I have an
interest in helping you ?

597
00:41:28,410 --> 00:41:31,780
Because they had me, and they
would have never let me go.

598
00:41:31,810 --> 00:41:34,600
They probably would've killed me
if I hadn't escaped.

599
00:41:35,270 --> 00:41:39,020
And the girl who helped me escape...

600
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:42,240
she was about 16 years old.

601
00:41:44,730 --> 00:41:47,210
And her name was Alex.

602
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:51,080
I'm pretty sure that
she's your daughter.

603
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:55,630
