00:00:00,782 --> 00:00:02,273
<i>Previously on</i> Lost...

2
00:00:02,332 --> 00:00:04,351
You want me to save your life?

3
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:06,477
I want you to want to save my life.

4
00:00:06,606 --> 00:00:09,119
Just made a small incision
in Ben's kidney sac.

5
00:00:09,178 --> 00:00:12,413
Now if I don't stitch that back up
in the next hour, he's dead.

6
00:00:12,414 --> 00:00:14,232
I would like for you
to go back in there,

7
00:00:14,337 --> 00:00:16,268
put Ben under and finish the surgery.

8
00:00:16,269 --> 00:00:17,565
And why would I want to do that?

9
00:00:17,621 --> 00:00:20,448
Because I'm going to go
help your friends escape.

10
00:00:50,664 --> 00:00:52,215
What, you wanna turn steering?

11
00:00:52,882 --> 00:00:53,999
We have to go back.

12
00:00:54,082 --> 00:00:55,526
What the hell are you talking about?

13
00:00:55,691 --> 00:00:57,158
Turn the boat around, I mean it.

14
00:00:57,205 --> 00:00:58,989
Have you lost your mind?
We just got away.

15
00:00:58,990 --> 00:00:59,990
Just do it.

16
00:01:00,045 --> 00:01:03,500
- You give me one good reason to turn...
- Because we can't leave Jack behind.

17
00:01:09,463 --> 00:01:10,874
Yes, we can, Freckles...

18
00:01:11,918 --> 00:01:13,804
'cause that's what he asked us to do.

19
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:16,272
I mean, think about it…
We go back there,

20
00:01:16,485 --> 00:01:19,631
what do you think captain bunnykiller's
gonna do if he catches us?

21
00:01:20,094 --> 00:01:21,139
He'll kill you.

22
00:01:24,453 --> 00:01:26,335
God loves you as he loved Jacob.

23
00:01:32,167 --> 00:01:33,402
Thanks for the input.

24
00:01:35,621 --> 00:01:36,621
Sorry, kiddo...

25
00:01:39,277 --> 00:01:40,335
Jack's on his own.

26
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:44,937
Time to get up.

27
00:01:46,691 --> 00:01:47,691
We're moving you.

28
00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:51,890
Moving me where?

29
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:53,285
Someplace else, Jack.

30
00:01:54,646 --> 00:01:55,646
Why?

31
00:02:02,007 --> 00:02:03,124
So this is it, huh?

32
00:02:03,864 --> 00:02:04,882
"It"?

33
00:02:04,952 --> 00:02:06,700
You just helped me save his life.

34
00:02:06,918 --> 00:02:08,256
If you're gonna kill me, please,

35
00:02:08,317 --> 00:02:11,428
at least show me the respect
of not calling it "moving."

36
00:02:12,202 --> 00:02:13,818
Now why would we kill you?

37
00:02:15,355 --> 00:02:16,941
Because you're done with me.

38
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,076
What kind of people do you think we are?

39
00:02:19,154 --> 00:02:20,248
I don't know, Tom.

40
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:23,054
The kind of people that would take
a pregnant woman...

41
00:02:23,337 --> 00:02:25,556
would hang Charlie from a tree...

42
00:02:26,016 --> 00:02:28,013
would drag our people
out of the jungle...

43
00:02:28,137 --> 00:02:29,793
would kidnap children…

44
00:02:31,353 --> 00:02:33,621
That's the kind of people
I think you are.

45
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:47,743
You see this glass house
you're living in, Jack?

46
00:02:49,334 --> 00:02:51,216
How 'bout I get you some stones?

47
00:02:57,923 --> 00:03:00,307
Let's do this the easy way.
What do you say?

48
00:03:46,621 --> 00:03:50,456
Sync by Sixe.

49
00:03:53,217 --> 00:03:57,380
www.swsub.com

50
00:04:15,399 --> 00:04:17,360
Dr. Jack? Hey, Dr. Jack?

51
00:04:18,533 --> 00:04:19,975
Dr. Jack want soda?

52
00:04:36,502 --> 00:04:38,999
You know I can't understand a word
you're saying, right?

53
00:04:43,104 --> 00:04:44,104
You're welcome.

54
00:05:56,206 --> 00:05:57,321
Thank you.

55
00:05:57,462 --> 00:05:58,731
Thank you very much.

56
00:05:59,063 --> 00:06:01,153
You're not from around here, are you?

57
00:06:04,224 --> 00:06:05,851
No. No, I'm not.

58
00:06:05,957 --> 00:06:07,753
I'm... Jack.

59
00:06:09,130 --> 00:06:11,485
Hi, Jack. I'm Achara.

60
00:06:12,134 --> 00:06:13,134
Achara...

61
00:06:35,719 --> 00:06:37,410
Juliet grilled these for me.

62
00:06:40,130 --> 00:06:41,281
Who's that woman?

63
00:06:42,453 --> 00:06:44,239
That'd be the sheriff.

64
00:06:45,401 --> 00:06:47,355
- You have a sheriff?
- Not literally.

65
00:06:47,409 --> 00:06:49,072
Why are you moving Juliet into my room?

66
00:06:49,248 --> 00:06:51,552
'Cause she's in trouble.

67
00:06:56,928 --> 00:06:58,502
Now don't try anything stupid.

68
00:06:58,631 --> 00:07:00,513
You stay put in this cage, okay?

69
00:07:00,601 --> 00:07:03,740
You say that like you're not watching me
from that camera right there.

70
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:05,335
Oh, right.

71
00:07:05,382 --> 00:07:08,386
Ben told me you got into
the surveillance room.

72
00:07:20,576 --> 00:07:21,933
Let me ask you something.

73
00:07:23,217 --> 00:07:25,471
You risk your neck to cut them loose,

74
00:07:25,628 --> 00:07:27,637
and they run away
and don't ever look back...

75
00:07:27,638 --> 00:07:29,049
Thanks for the sandwich.

76
00:07:39,276 --> 00:07:41,953
Never thought I'd be glad
to get back to this rock again.

77
00:07:42,108 --> 00:07:43,225
What are you doing?

78
00:07:43,758 --> 00:07:45,615
What's it look like?
I'm heading into shore.

79
00:07:45,616 --> 00:07:48,011
Why? If we just keep going,
we can circle round.

80
00:07:48,012 --> 00:07:50,970
Sooner or later we'll get to camp
and tell Locke and Sayid what happened.

81
00:07:50,971 --> 00:07:51,991
Oh, we will?

82
00:07:52,171 --> 00:07:54,621
You got a map you ain't showing me,
Magellan?

83
00:07:56,175 --> 00:07:59,282
We got no food, no water,
and I can't steer in the dark.

84
00:07:59,591 --> 00:08:00,730
Then I'll steer.

85
00:08:02,685 --> 00:08:04,505
You'll come ashore,
and we'll make camp.

86
00:08:07,294 --> 00:08:08,362
You want to contribute?

87
00:08:08,386 --> 00:08:10,492
You can build a campfire
while I carry the kid.

88
00:08:12,383 --> 00:08:13,482
Glad we agree.

89
00:08:27,467 --> 00:08:28,747
Sure you ain't hungry?

90
00:08:29,013 --> 00:08:30,542
No, James, I ain't hungry.

91
00:08:32,764 --> 00:08:33,940
You shouldn't fight.

92
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:37,284
When the hell did you wake up?

93
00:08:37,976 --> 00:08:40,755
You shouldn't fight
because you're lucky to be alive.

94
00:08:42,378 --> 00:08:44,435
Golly! I think he's got a point!

95
00:08:48,195 --> 00:08:50,769
That island we were on...
Is that where your people live?

96
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:51,941
Just where we work.

97
00:08:53,852 --> 00:08:54,852
Work on what?

98
00:08:55,302 --> 00:08:56,326
Projects.

99
00:08:56,361 --> 00:08:59,597
Oh, sure, like the "steal the kid
off the raft"
project?

100
00:09:00,210 --> 00:09:01,445
That was a humdinger.

101
00:09:01,508 --> 00:09:03,657
So you don't actually live
on that island?

102
00:09:04,632 --> 00:09:05,696
Do you live here...

103
00:09:07,026 --> 00:09:08,059
on this island?

104
00:09:08,992 --> 00:09:09,992
Yes, ma'am.

105
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:17,003
And what did you do with the people
that you took...

106
00:09:17,403 --> 00:09:19,857
- the kids?
- We give them a better life.

107
00:09:19,922 --> 00:09:20,955
Better than what?

108
00:09:22,708 --> 00:09:23,789
Better than yours.

109
00:09:31,871 --> 00:09:33,974
There's not gonna be any moon tonight.

110
00:09:34,976 --> 00:09:35,976
It'll be dark.

111
00:09:36,530 --> 00:09:39,032
Me and Alex used to lie in my backyard
at night,

112
00:09:39,111 --> 00:09:41,209
make up names for the constellations.

113
00:09:41,741 --> 00:09:42,756
You can't see it yet,

114
00:09:43,729 --> 00:09:46,124
but right there will be
"Ursa Theodorus"...

115
00:09:47,945 --> 00:09:48,945
the teddy bear.

116
00:09:49,645 --> 00:09:50,762
You have backyards?

117
00:09:55,358 --> 00:09:56,769
Well, ain't that quaint?

118
00:10:02,016 --> 00:10:03,049
<i>Warning!</i>

119
00:10:28,597 --> 00:10:29,806
I thought you were locked up.

120
00:10:29,866 --> 00:10:31,630
They let me out to examine Ben.

121
00:10:32,535 --> 00:10:34,750
His vitals are low, and he has a fever.

122
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:36,914
I took this about ten minutes ago.

123
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:38,252
It's of his stitches.

124
00:10:41,272 --> 00:10:42,917
They're infected, aren't they?

125
00:10:44,272 --> 00:10:46,373
- Yes.
- Will you come look at them?

126
00:10:49,702 --> 00:10:52,062
I'm not asking you for them... or him.

127
00:10:52,237 --> 00:10:54,648
I'm asking you as a personal favor
to me.

128
00:10:58,293 --> 00:11:00,919
You... want me to help him again?

129
00:11:01,539 --> 00:11:02,584
Yes.

130
00:11:03,502 --> 00:11:05,304
Are you sure about that, Juliet?

131
00:11:05,382 --> 00:11:07,625
Yes... I'm sure.

132
00:11:08,111 --> 00:11:11,706
And this is because he said
that he would let you go home?

133
00:11:19,319 --> 00:11:20,939
It's because I'm in trouble.

134
00:11:22,086 --> 00:11:24,231
- Trouble? For...
- I just killed someone.

135
00:11:24,436 --> 00:11:26,553
That's why they put me in your room.

136
00:11:26,934 --> 00:11:27,934
Who?

137
00:11:31,391 --> 00:11:32,513
It's complicated.

138
00:11:35,051 --> 00:11:37,345
Well, then, let me simplify it for you.

139
00:11:38,466 --> 00:11:39,936
I'm not gonna help him...

140
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:44,408
and I'm not gonna help you.

141
00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:08,359
Special Thai dish for you. You try.

142
00:12:22,047 --> 00:12:24,313
Very brave, very brave.

143
00:12:27,928 --> 00:12:29,163
My brother likes you.

144
00:12:29,449 --> 00:12:31,445
Well, I'm a very likeable guy.

145
00:12:35,494 --> 00:12:36,494
So, Jack...

146
00:12:38,041 --> 00:12:39,269
tell me something.

147
00:12:40,268 --> 00:12:41,289
Shoot.

148
00:12:41,757 --> 00:12:44,109
Why is it you don't know
how to fly a kite?

149
00:12:46,412 --> 00:12:47,670
Just never learned, I guess.

150
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:48,782
That's very sad.

151
00:12:50,017 --> 00:12:51,662
Well, my dad worked a lot.

152
00:12:53,082 --> 00:12:55,883
He wasn't exactly the kite-flying type,
anyway.

153
00:12:56,029 --> 00:12:57,421
I mean, we never really...

154
00:12:59,132 --> 00:13:00,954
I have no interest in your father.

155
00:13:02,339 --> 00:13:03,348
Well, that's a relief,

156
00:13:03,395 --> 00:13:05,842
because I'm pretty tired
of talking about him.

157
00:13:05,952 --> 00:13:07,459
Some things are personal.

158
00:13:15,304 --> 00:13:18,864
So you're in Phuket to...
"find yourself"?

159
00:13:20,810 --> 00:13:22,111
Why would you say that?

160
00:13:22,176 --> 00:13:23,315
You're an American.

161
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,980
I have... a gift.

162
00:13:47,515 --> 00:13:49,237
Must be one hell of a gift.

163
00:14:17,843 --> 00:14:19,944
I was just reading your tattoos.

164
00:14:20,618 --> 00:14:22,861
The "five" and the stars are very cute,

165
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:25,521
But the Chinese I find...

166
00:14:28,362 --> 00:14:29,362
a bit ironic.

167
00:14:30,722 --> 00:14:31,868
You find what ironic?

168
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:32,991
What it says.

169
00:14:35,492 --> 00:14:36,889
You do know what it says?

170
00:14:39,683 --> 00:14:41,680
Yeah, I know what it says.

171
00:14:42,785 --> 00:14:43,785
Are you sure?

172
00:14:44,542 --> 00:14:46,934
Chinese is a very complicated language.

173
00:14:47,146 --> 00:14:50,336
It's fairly common for some things
to get lost in translation.

174
00:14:50,404 --> 00:14:51,580
I know what it says.

175
00:14:54,262 --> 00:14:55,331
All right, then.

176
00:15:01,744 --> 00:15:02,884
My name is Isabel.

177
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:06,432
If you'll come with me,

178
00:15:07,833 --> 00:15:10,712
I'd like to talk to you and ask you
a few questions.

179
00:15:24,014 --> 00:15:25,964
Why don't you check on your father,
sweetheart?

180
00:15:25,965 --> 00:15:27,494
I know he'd appreciate it.

181
00:15:41,642 --> 00:15:43,217
Please, have a seat, Jack.

182
00:15:44,084 --> 00:15:47,713
As you may have gathered,
we don't live on this little island.

183
00:15:47,796 --> 00:15:51,031
In fact, most of us
don't really even like coming here.

184
00:15:51,755 --> 00:15:53,754
There's been an incident
that I'm investigating,

185
00:15:53,755 --> 00:15:55,875
and I need to ask you some questions,

186
00:15:56,108 --> 00:15:58,916
so I was hoping you may help me clear up

187
00:15:59,433 --> 00:16:02,474
a few of the... inconsistencies.

188
00:16:03,873 --> 00:16:05,814
Now correct me if I'm wrong, Tom,

189
00:16:05,903 --> 00:16:08,903
but you said, in the midst
of a surgical procedure,

190
00:16:09,037 --> 00:16:11,187
Jack made several comments indicating

191
00:16:11,246 --> 00:16:14,200
that Juliet had asked him to kill Ben.

192
00:16:16,678 --> 00:16:18,234
Yeah. That's right.

193
00:16:18,624 --> 00:16:19,741
Is that true, Jack?

194
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:23,188
Did Juliet ask you to kill Ben?

195
00:16:26,091 --> 00:16:27,385
The question's simple.

196
00:16:27,988 --> 00:16:29,811
Did Juliet ask you to kill Ben?

197
00:16:39,136 --> 00:16:40,357
No, I was lying.

198
00:16:41,485 --> 00:16:43,662
I would've done anything
to get my friends out,

199
00:16:43,727 --> 00:16:45,645
and turning you people
against each other

200
00:16:45,646 --> 00:16:47,544
was my best chance of creating chaos.

201
00:17:01,403 --> 00:17:03,516
Why are you lying for her, Jack?

202
00:17:15,721 --> 00:17:17,779
I'd like to go back to my cage now.

203
00:17:27,207 --> 00:17:28,357
Who's there?

204
00:17:31,021 --> 00:17:32,315
Who do you think?

205
00:17:43,939 --> 00:17:44,939
What time is it?

206
00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:48,242
It's late.

207
00:17:55,103 --> 00:17:56,103
Salty.

208
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,983
I went for a swim in the ocean.

209
00:17:58,606 --> 00:18:00,592
Washing the day off of you, huh?

210
00:18:03,894 --> 00:18:06,442
Is there something
you'd like to ask me, Jack?

211
00:18:06,725 --> 00:18:07,812
No, not at all.

212
00:18:09,079 --> 00:18:10,079
I mean...

213
00:18:10,629 --> 00:18:11,746
it might be nice...

214
00:18:12,678 --> 00:18:15,972
after a month of you coming and going
whenever you want,

215
00:18:16,231 --> 00:18:18,113
to find out something about you.

216
00:18:23,995 --> 00:18:27,877
There are things that happen here
that you could never understand.

217
00:18:36,875 --> 00:18:37,875
Like your gift?

218
00:18:40,027 --> 00:18:41,027
Yes...

219
00:18:42,038 --> 00:18:43,038
like my gift.

220
00:19:06,688 --> 00:19:08,669
Are you having fun with me, Jack?

221
00:19:11,334 --> 00:19:12,334
Oh, yeah.

222
00:19:14,209 --> 00:19:15,749
Then stop ask questions.

223
00:19:16,130 --> 00:19:17,241
Let's have fun.

224
00:19:39,179 --> 00:19:40,231
What?

225
00:19:50,876 --> 00:19:51,881
Do I...

226
00:19:53,403 --> 00:19:54,403
do I know you?

227
00:19:57,853 --> 00:19:58,905
815. You're...

228
00:20:01,859 --> 00:20:03,270
you were the stewardess.

229
00:20:03,363 --> 00:20:04,363
Cindy.

230
00:20:08,335 --> 00:20:10,601
What are you doing here, with them?

231
00:20:10,688 --> 00:20:13,533
I thought you were taken.
You were... You were captured.

232
00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:17,366
They're not... it's not that simple.

233
00:20:19,683 --> 00:20:21,138
What are they doing here right now?

234
00:20:21,139 --> 00:20:22,609
What are you doing here?!

235
00:20:24,691 --> 00:20:26,220
We're here to watch, Jack.

236
00:20:27,502 --> 00:20:28,502
Watch what?

237
00:20:32,556 --> 00:20:33,908
What is it, sweetheart?

238
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:41,268
She... wants to know
how Ana Lucia's doing.

239
00:20:48,179 --> 00:20:50,351
- Are you serious?
- What?

240
00:20:50,421 --> 00:20:53,509
If you've got something to watch,
Cindy, go watch it!

241
00:21:26,746 --> 00:21:28,307
- What?
- Sawyer, wake up.

242
00:21:31,506 --> 00:21:32,506
He's gone.

243
00:21:33,503 --> 00:21:34,503
Karl's gone.

244
00:21:34,910 --> 00:21:35,910
Where?

245
00:21:50,038 --> 00:21:51,107
I got it.

246
00:21:51,464 --> 00:21:52,567
No, let me talk to him.

247
00:21:52,614 --> 00:21:53,682
No, I got it.

248
00:21:54,687 --> 00:21:55,687
Boys only.

249
00:22:08,479 --> 00:22:10,025
What the hell was that for?

250
00:22:10,097 --> 00:22:11,236
So you'd cowboy up.

251
00:22:13,734 --> 00:22:15,021
Crying in the jungle.

252
00:22:15,787 --> 00:22:18,343
I thought you
people were supposed to be tough.

253
00:22:19,258 --> 00:22:20,345
I am tough.

254
00:22:22,605 --> 00:22:23,781
Sure you are, Bobby.

255
00:22:26,313 --> 00:22:27,783
Bobby? "The Brady bunch"?

256
00:22:29,552 --> 00:22:31,114
What the hell's "The Brady bunch"?

257
00:22:35,076 --> 00:22:36,386
Anyway, look...

258
00:22:41,183 --> 00:22:42,888
I’ve been with a lot of girls...

259
00:22:46,038 --> 00:22:47,920
some of them worth the trouble...

260
00:22:49,497 --> 00:22:50,497
some not.

261
00:22:52,596 --> 00:22:53,890
Every now and again...

262
00:22:54,851 --> 00:22:55,851
there's one...

263
00:23:02,375 --> 00:23:04,167
one you name dumb stars with.

264
00:23:10,239 --> 00:23:13,252
So this girl, Sally Slingshot...

265
00:23:13,670 --> 00:23:14,674
Alex.

266
00:23:16,194 --> 00:23:17,194
You love her?

267
00:23:19,349 --> 00:23:20,466
More than anything.

268
00:23:23,493 --> 00:23:25,700
Then go back
to wherever the hell your...

269
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:28,472
yards are, and get her back.

270
00:23:31,064 --> 00:23:34,809
If I get caught,
they'll kill me this time.

271
00:23:40,284 --> 00:23:41,364
Well...

272
00:23:42,326 --> 00:23:43,947
at least it'll be worth it.

273
00:24:03,595 --> 00:24:05,110
I wanna ask you something.

274
00:24:06,348 --> 00:24:09,127
They're not watching anymore,
so you can tell me the truth.

275
00:24:13,507 --> 00:24:14,507
Ben...

276
00:24:15,293 --> 00:24:16,779
Why'd you save his life?

277
00:24:18,329 --> 00:24:19,421
All this time...

278
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:21,215
After all he did to you
and your people...

279
00:24:21,216 --> 00:24:22,392
you should hate him,

280
00:24:24,117 --> 00:24:25,705
But you still fixed him up,

281
00:24:26,522 --> 00:24:28,757
even after your friends got away. Why?

282
00:24:29,878 --> 00:24:31,158
You're his daughter.

283
00:24:33,484 --> 00:24:34,660
Answer the question.

284
00:24:34,735 --> 00:24:37,793
I'll answer your question
if you answer one of mine.

285
00:24:39,890 --> 00:24:40,890
Where's Juliet?

286
00:24:41,046 --> 00:24:42,693
She's with the rest of them.

287
00:24:43,245 --> 00:24:45,068
They're gonna read her verdict.

288
00:24:45,559 --> 00:24:46,581
Her verdict?

289
00:24:46,604 --> 00:24:48,589
And we all know what it's gonna be.

290
00:24:49,512 --> 00:24:52,394
We're pretty strict
about killing one of our own.

291
00:24:55,122 --> 00:24:56,122
Eye for an eye.

292
00:24:56,433 --> 00:24:58,030
Who? Who did she kill?

293
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:00,750
The man who was gonna murder
your friends.

294
00:25:07,845 --> 00:25:10,080
No wonder you're so worried about her.

295
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:13,961
If it wasn't for you,
she never would have done it.

296
00:25:14,969 --> 00:25:16,439
That was three questions.

297
00:25:17,758 --> 00:25:18,827
Your turn, Jack.

298
00:25:21,157 --> 00:25:23,705
I saved your father
because I said I would.

299
00:25:34,588 --> 00:25:35,882
Is he still in charge?

300
00:25:36,992 --> 00:25:38,596
- What?
- Ben, your father...

301
00:25:38,597 --> 00:25:39,795
Is he still in charge?

302
00:25:39,796 --> 00:25:41,653
Will that woman Isabel do what he says?

303
00:25:43,751 --> 00:25:45,162
Get me out of this cage.

304
00:25:49,492 --> 00:25:50,609
I wouldn't do that.

305
00:25:56,253 --> 00:25:58,486
The cavalry has arrived at last.

306
00:26:10,729 --> 00:26:14,097
I'd be much more impressed with you
people if you had a good surgeon.

307
00:26:17,894 --> 00:26:19,998
We had an excellent surgeon, Jack.

308
00:26:21,234 --> 00:26:22,537
His name was Ethan.

309
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:27,033
You have a very serious infection, Ben.

310
00:26:27,458 --> 00:26:30,634
That infected tissue
needs to be re-incised, debrided,

311
00:26:30,809 --> 00:26:34,279
and you need to be very closely
monitored from here on out.

312
00:26:35,819 --> 00:26:39,642
There might be nerve damage
or any number of other complications.

313
00:26:41,084 --> 00:26:42,554
You might not walk again.

314
00:26:44,663 --> 00:26:47,916
Your bedside manner
leaves something to be desired.

315
00:26:48,954 --> 00:26:51,505
Well, then,
it's too bad you're stuck with me.

316
00:26:53,649 --> 00:26:55,470
- Am I?
- You need a doctor,

317
00:26:56,515 --> 00:26:57,988
someone to stay with you

318
00:26:59,559 --> 00:27:01,285
bring you back to good health.

319
00:27:04,869 --> 00:27:07,059
And here we go again.

320
00:27:09,229 --> 00:27:12,094
I've already given you
a ticket off this island.

321
00:27:12,129 --> 00:27:14,239
What's it gonna cost me this time?

322
00:27:14,670 --> 00:27:17,300
Right now your people are in a room

323
00:27:17,385 --> 00:27:20,604
deciding whether or not
to execute Juliet.

324
00:27:25,499 --> 00:27:26,734
You're gonna stop it.

325
00:27:28,358 --> 00:27:30,578
Juliet doesn't care about you, Jack.

326
00:27:32,615 --> 00:27:34,438
Doesn't matter what she's done,

327
00:27:35,776 --> 00:27:37,364
No matter what you think...

328
00:27:40,281 --> 00:27:41,556
she's one of us.

329
00:27:45,138 --> 00:27:47,470
Do we have a deal or not?

330
00:27:55,251 --> 00:27:56,966
Does Isabel have a walkie?

331
00:27:58,998 --> 00:28:00,548
They're already in the meeting.

332
00:28:07,873 --> 00:28:09,873
Then get me something to write on.

333
00:29:25,593 --> 00:29:26,704
You following me.

334
00:29:33,150 --> 00:29:34,225
What is all this?

335
00:29:37,026 --> 00:29:39,849
This is where I work,
and you shouldn't be here.

336
00:29:44,336 --> 00:29:45,474
This is a...

337
00:29:46,990 --> 00:29:47,990
a tattoo parlor.

338
00:29:48,042 --> 00:29:49,546
This was your big secret?

339
00:29:51,145 --> 00:29:53,665
The envelopes... your gift?

340
00:29:54,053 --> 00:29:55,927
I am not a tattoo artist.

341
00:30:03,223 --> 00:30:05,179
I'm able to see who people are.

342
00:30:06,734 --> 00:30:09,119
My work is not decoration...

343
00:30:09,985 --> 00:30:11,248
it is definition...

344
00:30:14,188 --> 00:30:15,188
and this...

345
00:30:16,191 --> 00:30:17,191
this is my gift.

346
00:30:18,853 --> 00:30:19,853
So...

347
00:30:21,199 --> 00:30:22,615
you see who people are.

348
00:30:23,271 --> 00:30:24,339
Yes...

349
00:30:25,048 --> 00:30:26,304
and I mark them.

350
00:30:30,474 --> 00:30:31,743
So tell me who I am.

351
00:30:33,874 --> 00:30:34,874
No.

352
00:30:36,325 --> 00:30:38,891
- Why not?
- You are an outsider.

353
00:30:39,060 --> 00:30:40,659
So you can sleep with me...

354
00:30:41,132 --> 00:30:42,132
I'm not allowed.

355
00:30:44,341 --> 00:30:46,174
Do you see who I am, Achara?

356
00:30:48,095 --> 00:30:49,095
Yes.

357
00:30:51,009 --> 00:30:52,009
Who am I?

358
00:30:52,506 --> 00:30:56,089
You are a leader, a great man.

359
00:30:58,012 --> 00:30:59,012
But this...

360
00:31:02,170 --> 00:31:03,581
this makes you lonely...

361
00:31:05,330 --> 00:31:06,330
and frightened..

362
00:31:08,285 --> 00:31:09,285
and angry.

363
00:31:19,196 --> 00:31:20,196
Good.

364
00:31:21,996 --> 00:31:23,195
Now put it on me.

365
00:31:25,606 --> 00:31:26,606
Put it on me.

366
00:31:27,705 --> 00:31:28,980
No. This...

367
00:31:30,115 --> 00:31:31,644
this is against my people.

368
00:31:42,734 --> 00:31:44,675
There will be consequences, Jack.

369
00:31:46,634 --> 00:31:47,634
There always are.

370
00:32:13,147 --> 00:32:14,344
Wait. No,

371
00:32:14,531 --> 00:32:15,835
you shouldn't be here.

372
00:32:15,978 --> 00:32:16,978
Just stand back.

373
00:32:17,657 --> 00:32:18,774
Don't say anything.

374
00:32:28,177 --> 00:32:29,210
Alex, you...

375
00:32:34,092 --> 00:32:36,252
What the hell
did you bring him here for?!

376
00:32:36,388 --> 00:32:37,428
Let him go, Tom.

377
00:32:39,845 --> 00:32:41,408
What's going on, Alex?

378
00:32:43,751 --> 00:32:44,751
This is from Ben.

379
00:32:54,525 --> 00:32:57,808
Ben has commuted Juliet's sentence.

380
00:32:58,367 --> 00:33:00,070
Execution is off the table.

381
00:33:00,515 --> 00:33:02,360
He says the rules don't apply.

382
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:08,284
He has, however,
ordered her to be marked.

383
00:33:46,704 --> 00:33:47,939
Hey, where you going?

384
00:34:01,732 --> 00:34:02,732
Hey, I know you.

385
00:34:04,731 --> 00:34:06,319
I'm Achara's friend from...

386
00:34:07,485 --> 00:34:09,559
...Chet's. Jack from the restaurant.

387
00:34:15,142 --> 00:34:16,340
Let go of me, man.

388
00:34:40,550 --> 00:34:41,995
You will get off our beach!

389
00:34:42,144 --> 00:34:43,471
You leave this country!

390
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:45,203
Do you understand me?

391
00:35:49,259 --> 00:35:51,308
I heard you only liked them grilled.

392
00:35:54,309 --> 00:35:55,971
I missed the toothpicks, too.

393
00:36:06,579 --> 00:36:07,579
Let me see.

394
00:36:08,281 --> 00:36:09,356
They marked you.

395
00:36:09,681 --> 00:36:10,681
Let me see it.

396
00:36:32,776 --> 00:36:34,737
Break a branch off that aloe plant
over there...

397
00:36:35,227 --> 00:36:36,725
Please. Please do it.

398
00:36:54,099 --> 00:36:55,450
All right, turn around.

399
00:37:17,802 --> 00:37:18,978
Why did you help me?

400
00:37:20,304 --> 00:37:22,554
He told you he was gonna
let you go home.

401
00:37:23,214 --> 00:37:24,743
He told me the same thing.

402
00:37:26,161 --> 00:37:28,513
We're gonna make sure he keeps his word.

403
00:37:29,070 --> 00:37:30,952
And how are we going to do that?

404
00:37:31,771 --> 00:37:32,771
Together.

405
00:37:45,804 --> 00:37:48,904
They'll be coming for you
in a few minutes...

406
00:37:49,507 --> 00:37:50,507
All of them.

407
00:37:51,563 --> 00:37:53,210
Your friends know where we are,

408
00:37:53,290 --> 00:37:56,496
so we have to leave this island
to go back to where we live.

409
00:37:57,571 --> 00:37:58,571
Go where?

410
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:01,949
Well, Ben calls it "home."

411
00:38:08,231 --> 00:38:09,231
Where's Karl?

412
00:38:10,036 --> 00:38:11,036
I let him go.

413
00:38:12,845 --> 00:38:14,548
- You what?
- I let him go.

414
00:38:15,364 --> 00:38:17,253
He could have led us back
to where they live.

415
00:38:17,254 --> 00:38:19,969
What, you think I cut him loose
'cause I'm so damn sensitive?

416
00:38:20,047 --> 00:38:21,263
The kid's a target.

417
00:38:23,704 --> 00:38:26,024
Ben ain't never gonna stop
looking for him, so as long…

418
00:38:26,064 --> 00:38:29,427
All Ben wants is that kid
as far from his daughter as possible.

419
00:38:30,664 --> 00:38:32,015
Let's get back to camp.

420
00:38:37,691 --> 00:38:39,031
Are you coming or not?

421
00:38:39,990 --> 00:38:42,872
Should I walk beside you
or ten paces behind you?

422
00:38:44,136 --> 00:38:45,769
You're so good at telling me what to do,

423
00:38:45,770 --> 00:38:47,096
I can't think for myself anymore.

424
00:38:47,097 --> 00:38:49,567
Don't take it out on me
'cause you feel guilty.

425
00:38:49,661 --> 00:38:50,753
I don't feel guilty.

426
00:38:50,806 --> 00:38:51,903
The hell you don't!

427
00:38:51,904 --> 00:38:53,195
We had to leave Jack behind.

428
00:38:53,215 --> 00:38:55,154
- I didn't have a choice...
- I'm not talking

429
00:38:55,155 --> 00:38:56,542
about leaving Jack behind.

430
00:39:01,781 --> 00:39:05,104
I'm talking about you and me.

431
00:39:12,837 --> 00:39:15,870
I know you did it 'cause you thought
I was a dead man...

432
00:39:16,815 --> 00:39:19,938
so don't beat yourself up
'cause the doc's left behind.

433
00:39:23,467 --> 00:39:24,996
I'm not beating myself up.

434
00:39:26,068 --> 00:39:27,185
'Course you're not.

435
00:39:33,833 --> 00:39:36,613
So now that we got that out of the way,
let's go.

436
00:40:01,388 --> 00:40:05,486
"He walks amongst us,
but he is not one of us."

437
00:40:06,573 --> 00:40:07,657
Your tattoos...

438
00:40:08,138 --> 00:40:09,461
That's what they say.

439
00:40:15,042 --> 00:40:16,277
That's what they say.

440
00:40:17,346 --> 00:40:18,757
It's not what they mean.
