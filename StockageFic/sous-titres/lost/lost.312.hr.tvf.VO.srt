00:00:00,554 --> 00:00:02,098
<i>Previously on </i>Lost...

2
00:00:02,252 --> 00:00:03,641
I don't care what Jack said.

3
00:00:03,718 --> 00:00:06,265
They've got him.
We have to get him back. I owe him that.

4
00:00:06,795 --> 00:00:08,913
The man in the house.
You said you seen him before?

5
00:00:08,922 --> 00:00:10,769
On the video feed
from the pearl station.

6
00:00:10,894 --> 00:00:13,383
Why are we continuing
to play this little game,

7
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:16,016
when we all know
it has moved to the next stage?

8
00:00:20,086 --> 00:00:22,276
This is a map
showing electrical and data cabling

9
00:00:22,436 --> 00:00:24,137
comprised of houses and dormitories.

10
00:00:24,253 --> 00:00:26,173
Sounds like a place well worth visiting.

11
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:29,168
I saw a lightning hit the roof.

12
00:00:29,554 --> 00:00:30,846
You were electrocuted.

13
00:00:30,943 --> 00:00:33,934
And when you heard Claire was in
the water, you drown trying to save her.

14
00:00:33,972 --> 00:00:35,709
I dove in myself so you never went in.

15
00:00:35,824 --> 00:00:38,429
I'm trying pal,
I tried twice to save you, but...

16
00:00:38,554 --> 00:00:40,097
no matter what I try to do...

17
00:00:40,329 --> 00:00:41,949
you gonna die Charlie.

18
00:01:31,243 --> 00:01:32,304
Mom!

19
00:01:49,263 --> 00:01:50,672
Oh look, Aaron!

20
00:01:50,787 --> 00:01:53,295
Your mom has finaly decided to wake up.

21
00:01:57,723 --> 00:01:59,488
The only way I could get you to sleep in

22
00:01:59,691 --> 00:02:01,138
was to borrow the midget.

23
00:02:03,376 --> 00:02:05,436
And, what is all this?

24
00:02:05,571 --> 00:02:09,606
An aperitive,
of mysterious island fruit.

25
00:02:10,038 --> 00:02:11,946
Before the breakfast picnic

26
00:02:12,061 --> 00:02:14,414
I have set up in your honor

27
00:02:15,142 --> 00:02:16,691
a short walk down the beach.

28
00:02:17,447 --> 00:02:19,010
What's gotten into you, Charlie?

29
00:02:19,231 --> 00:02:20,234
Sorry?

30
00:02:20,255 --> 00:02:22,161
It's just, you've been
so depressed all week,

31
00:02:22,225 --> 00:02:26,188
and now it's breakfast in bed
and picnics?

32
00:02:26,329 --> 00:02:27,930
I woke up this morning, and I thought,

33
00:02:27,949 --> 00:02:31,143
it's time to stop feeling sorry
for yourself and seize the day,

34
00:02:31,255 --> 00:02:33,127
and I can't think
of anyone I'd rather do

35
00:02:33,204 --> 00:02:36,156
some day-seizing with than you.

36
00:02:38,232 --> 00:02:39,906
So... What do you say?

37
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:43,677
Let's drop
the cherub off with auntie Sun

38
00:02:44,029 --> 00:02:47,140
and uncle Jin, and you and I

39
00:02:48,184 --> 00:02:49,461
go for a little stroll.

40
00:02:50,538 --> 00:02:51,538
I would love to.

41
00:02:54,603 --> 00:02:55,953
From the position of this stream,

42
00:02:55,972 --> 00:02:59,044
we should be here,
and if the scale is right,

43
00:02:59,604 --> 00:03:01,881
his people
are 2 miles in that direction.

44
00:03:04,208 --> 00:03:06,152
I don't expect you to confirm that.

45
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:12,531
It's an electrical wiring map, Sayid.

46
00:03:12,624 --> 00:03:14,423
I'm not sure
it's as accurate as you think.

47
00:03:14,424 --> 00:03:17,747
Well, it's certainly not as infallible
as the magical carvings on your stick.

48
00:03:17,778 --> 00:03:20,016
Hey, the stick
didget us to that station.

49
00:03:20,083 --> 00:03:22,692
Oh, the station which
you accidentally blew up.

50
00:03:22,751 --> 00:03:25,472
If you'd have warned me
that the basement was rigged with C-4,

51
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:27,314
I might've been a little more careful.

52
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:35,212
Why don't you just tell us
if we're going the right way?

53
00:03:35,908 --> 00:03:37,408
You're going the right way.

54
00:03:37,609 --> 00:03:39,259
Remind me why we're keeping him alive.

55
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:41,102
What do you suggest,
we shoot him like a dog?

56
00:03:41,122 --> 00:03:42,935
No. I like dogs.

57
00:03:43,115 --> 00:03:46,448
He's right. They would not trade
his life for your friend's.

58
00:03:46,821 --> 00:03:48,392
- We should shoot him.
- Enough!

59
00:03:48,506 --> 00:03:50,019
Nobody's shooting anybody.

60
00:03:50,827 --> 00:03:53,327
The map says where they are,
and he says the map is right,

61
00:03:53,578 --> 00:03:54,890
so just keep moving.

62
00:04:01,971 --> 00:04:03,912
Okay, here we are, here we are.

63
00:04:05,448 --> 00:04:06,448
Not bad, eh?

64
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:07,649
Not bad at all.

65
00:04:08,514 --> 00:04:10,505
Well, if you'll take your seat,

66
00:04:10,543 --> 00:04:15,560
we will begin with our first course,
which is cereal.

67
00:04:16,136 --> 00:04:18,432
- We have fresh fruit salad--
- Good morning.

68
00:04:20,047 --> 00:04:22,778
Good morning yourself.

69
00:04:23,905 --> 00:04:25,415
What brings you down to the beach?

70
00:04:25,475 --> 00:04:26,594
Boar are running thick.

71
00:04:26,817 --> 00:04:29,539
I was hoping you might
want to join me on a hunt.

72
00:04:30,721 --> 00:04:32,051
Oh. Well...

73
00:04:33,275 --> 00:04:34,981
Thanks for the invite, but...

74
00:04:35,432 --> 00:04:38,908
as you can see,
we're just about to begin a picnic.

75
00:04:39,005 --> 00:04:41,127
Well, I think hunting might be a...

76
00:04:41,667 --> 00:04:43,828
a better way to spend your day, Charlie.

77
00:04:44,463 --> 00:04:47,183
I mean, of all the things
you could choose to do today,

78
00:04:47,345 --> 00:04:49,202
hunting with me might be
your best option.

79
00:04:49,259 --> 00:04:52,018
Oh, my God.

80
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:53,482
What is it?

81
00:04:53,521 --> 00:04:55,584
I think I know
how to get us off this island.

82
00:05:10,168 --> 00:05:21,884
Subtitles: swsub.com

83
00:05:25,287 --> 00:05:26,731
Claire, what's the matter?

84
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:28,820
I need Jin's nets and fish.

85
00:05:29,043 --> 00:05:31,588
We've gotta hurry. And buckets...
I'm gonna need those, too.

86
00:05:32,575 --> 00:05:34,582
- We have to catch the birds.
- What birds?

87
00:05:34,602 --> 00:05:36,931
They just flew over, and they're
only gonna be here today,

88
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:38,547
so to catch one, we need to do it now.

89
00:05:38,548 --> 00:05:39,936
Oh, this sounds like fun.

90
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:42,428
Can you get some nets?

91
00:05:42,447 --> 00:05:43,913
Nets for what, Barb...

92
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:48,771
Nets for what, Claire?

93
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:53,269
Okay, five minutes ago,
a flock of sea birds flew over my head.

94
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:56,827
Seabirds are migratory, which means
they're gonna keep heading south.

95
00:05:58,176 --> 00:06:00,175
I'm sorry. I don't understand
why we need to...

96
00:06:00,271 --> 00:06:01,293
They're tagged.

97
00:06:01,379 --> 00:06:02,379
Tagged?

98
00:06:03,031 --> 00:06:05,471
Scientists tag these birds
so they can track them.

99
00:06:05,548 --> 00:06:09,211
So when they eventually land
in Australia or New Zealand or wherever,

100
00:06:09,924 --> 00:06:11,564
somebody's gonna gather them up.

101
00:06:13,445 --> 00:06:14,847
We can send a message.

102
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:16,261
If we can catch one.

103
00:06:16,398 --> 00:06:17,451
Okay, so here's the plan.

104
00:06:17,452 --> 00:06:19,422
First, we've gotta cut up
these fish, make chum.

105
00:06:19,441 --> 00:06:21,274
That'll get the birds
to settle in the water.

106
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:24,319
And then, um, we're gonna need
to cut up some of this net.

107
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:26,468
Charlie, can you go get some knives?

108
00:06:34,807 --> 00:06:37,384
How do you even know
this stuff about birds?

109
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:40,158
I watched a lot of nature shows
with my mum.

110
00:06:40,196 --> 00:06:42,029
Doesn't exactly make you an expert.

111
00:06:43,642 --> 00:06:47,604
I just-- I don't want to see you
wasting your time, that's all.

112
00:06:50,149 --> 00:06:52,287
So what happened to seizing the day?

113
00:06:55,507 --> 00:06:56,507
Sorry.

114
00:06:57,862 --> 00:06:58,973
Don't see the point.

115
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:14,701
Hold still, dear. Just another second.

116
00:07:16,387 --> 00:07:17,387
There.

117
00:07:18,191 --> 00:07:19,191
We're through now.

118
00:07:24,802 --> 00:07:26,690
Ms. Littleton, I'm Officer Barnes.

119
00:07:26,904 --> 00:07:29,706
Sorry to bother you,
but I need to ask you a few questions.

120
00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:32,032
Can I ask you how the accident happened?

121
00:07:34,066 --> 00:07:36,062
A truck forced us off the road.

122
00:07:37,556 --> 00:07:39,658
Okay, and who was driving?

123
00:07:43,123 --> 00:07:44,203
Me.

124
00:07:46,671 --> 00:07:48,214
Has anyone contacted your father?

125
00:07:48,405 --> 00:07:49,891
My father died when I was 2.

126
00:07:50,238 --> 00:07:51,293
Sorry to hear that.

127
00:07:53,745 --> 00:07:55,276
I spoke with the truck driver.

128
00:07:55,343 --> 00:07:56,565
He's fine, by the way.

129
00:07:56,648 --> 00:07:59,500
- He said that when you hit him...
- No, he hit us.

130
00:08:00,602 --> 00:08:03,996
About what speed would you say
that happened when you were driving?

131
00:08:04,035 --> 00:08:05,480
It just came out of nowhere.

132
00:08:05,557 --> 00:08:07,827
That's not the question
I asked, Ms. Littleton.

133
00:08:09,114 --> 00:08:11,791
I don't know how fast I was driving.

134
00:08:13,067 --> 00:08:15,611
Why are you even asking me
these questions?

135
00:08:16,175 --> 00:08:19,013
These questions are standard procedure
when there's a fatality.

136
00:08:21,151 --> 00:08:22,791
My mother is in surgery.

137
00:08:23,685 --> 00:08:24,685
She's not dead.

138
00:08:25,472 --> 00:08:26,495
Right.

139
00:08:28,744 --> 00:08:29,744
So she is.

140
00:08:29,801 --> 00:08:31,523
You know, this is not my fault!

141
00:08:33,949 --> 00:08:34,949
Didn't say it was.

142
00:08:35,604 --> 00:08:36,810
Good day, Ms. Littleton.

143
00:08:51,362 --> 00:08:52,751
Can I ask you something?

144
00:09:05,296 --> 00:09:07,983
I told you that your daughter
was living with them...

145
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:13,334
end you haven't asked me
a single question about her.

146
00:09:14,067 --> 00:09:16,623
- You haven't--
- Your friend Jack,

147
00:09:17,698 --> 00:09:18,824
you care about him?

148
00:09:21,669 --> 00:09:22,669
Yes.

149
00:09:24,098 --> 00:09:25,893
Imagine 16 years from now,

150
00:09:26,645 --> 00:09:27,996
you're told he's still alive.

151
00:09:28,881 --> 00:09:33,371
But in your heart,
you know that he wouldn't remember you.

152
00:09:33,987 --> 00:09:35,153
He wouldn't know you.

153
00:09:37,191 --> 00:09:40,508
Wouldn't even know
that you ever cared about him.

154
00:09:49,712 --> 00:09:52,123
I haven't asked you questions
about my daughter...

155
00:09:54,367 --> 00:09:56,624
because I do not want
to know the answers.

156
00:10:13,562 --> 00:10:14,644
Water?

157
00:10:15,096 --> 00:10:16,429
No, thank you.

158
00:10:18,303 --> 00:10:19,525
So how'd you get here?

159
00:10:20,166 --> 00:10:21,680
How'd you get onto this island?

160
00:10:21,743 --> 00:10:22,989
Don't waste your breath.

161
00:10:23,126 --> 00:10:24,862
Whatever he says will be a lie.

162
00:10:25,424 --> 00:10:27,334
I was recruited when I was 24.

163
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:30,568
- I was approached by a man...
- I didn't ask you when I asked you how.

164
00:10:31,571 --> 00:10:33,239
They brought me on the submarine.

165
00:10:33,823 --> 00:10:36,677
So your people, they can just come
and go whenever they want?

166
00:10:36,716 --> 00:10:37,830
Go, yes,

167
00:10:38,262 --> 00:10:40,338
but two weeks ago,
our underwater beacon

168
00:10:40,415 --> 00:10:42,167
stopped emitting its locator signal.

169
00:10:42,936 --> 00:10:46,046
There was an event...
an electromagnetic pulse.

170
00:10:46,492 --> 00:10:48,114
It would be impossible to come back.

171
00:10:48,193 --> 00:10:49,543
Why would you want to come back?

172
00:10:49,544 --> 00:10:50,932
You would not understand.

173
00:10:54,801 --> 00:10:55,801
Try me.

174
00:10:56,707 --> 00:10:57,707
I misspoke.

175
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:02,088
What I mnt to say is,
you're not capable of understanding.

176
00:11:02,164 --> 00:11:03,522
And why am I not capable?

177
00:11:05,219 --> 00:11:06,996
Because you are not on the list.

178
00:11:09,690 --> 00:11:10,835
What list?

179
00:11:15,584 --> 00:11:17,068
The man who brought me here,

180
00:11:17,223 --> 00:11:19,094
who brought all of my people here,

181
00:11:19,557 --> 00:11:22,306
he is... a magnificent man.

182
00:11:24,947 --> 00:11:26,305
If Ben's so magnificent,

183
00:11:26,321 --> 00:11:28,347
then why did he need one of us
to save him?

184
00:11:28,405 --> 00:11:30,517
Ben? Ben is not...

185
00:11:33,911 --> 00:11:36,299
I will try to make this
as simple as I can.

186
00:11:36,766 --> 00:11:39,488
You are not on the list
because you are flawed...

187
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:42,852
Because you are angry...

188
00:11:44,927 --> 00:11:47,484
And weak and frightened.

189
00:11:48,526 --> 00:11:50,030
The more I learn about your people,

190
00:11:50,031 --> 00:11:53,323
the more I suspect you're not
as omniscient as you'd have us believe.

191
00:11:54,479 --> 00:11:56,447
Don't speak to us as if you know us.

192
00:11:56,793 --> 00:11:59,070
Of course I don't know you,
Sayid Jarrah.

193
00:11:59,648 --> 00:12:00,648
How could I?

194
00:12:02,607 --> 00:12:05,495
And you, Kate Austen,
are a complete stranger to me.

195
00:12:08,659 --> 00:12:10,030
But you, John Locke,

196
00:12:10,648 --> 00:12:14,159
you, I might have a fleeting memory of,
but I must be confused,

197
00:12:14,324 --> 00:12:16,546
because the John Locke
I know was para...

198
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:20,273
Look at this.

199
00:12:26,379 --> 00:12:28,488
Over here. Come on.

200
00:13:13,029 --> 00:13:15,769
Well, looks like we're here.

201
00:13:21,748 --> 00:13:23,422
- Will this work?
- Yes.

202
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:25,378
Work.

203
00:13:35,251 --> 00:13:36,910
Please... Help.

204
00:13:45,943 --> 00:13:47,330
Smells great.

205
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:48,924
Let's get it over with.

206
00:13:53,155 --> 00:13:54,932
This was my mother's worst fear.

207
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:56,660
What do you mean?

208
00:13:56,761 --> 00:13:59,384
That I would end up
doing something very much like this,

209
00:13:59,462 --> 00:14:00,702
cutting bait.

210
00:14:00,863 --> 00:14:02,773
She had high hopes for my future.

211
00:14:04,018 --> 00:14:06,851
They did not include
me marrying a fisherman's son.

212
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:12,273
Well, I guess we don't always turn out
like our mothers want.

213
00:14:12,634 --> 00:14:15,245
Of course,
mine never worked a day in her life.

214
00:14:20,745 --> 00:14:22,869
My mom was a librarian.

215
00:14:24,198 --> 00:14:25,198
Was?

216
00:14:31,869 --> 00:14:33,779
We should get this stuff out there.

217
00:14:55,468 --> 00:14:56,529
Where were you?

218
00:14:59,751 --> 00:15:01,362
I went home to take a shower.

219
00:15:02,352 --> 00:15:03,740
That must have been nice.

220
00:15:03,893 --> 00:15:05,752
They said she was still in surgery.

221
00:15:08,515 --> 00:15:10,700
I had glass in my hair, Aunt Lindsey.

222
00:15:11,172 --> 00:15:14,814
Well, I'm glad
that you're feeling refreshed.

223
00:15:18,679 --> 00:15:19,679
Good afternoon.

224
00:15:20,352 --> 00:15:21,529
Are you the daughter?

225
00:15:22,882 --> 00:15:24,826
I'm Dr. Woodruff from neurosurgery.

226
00:15:25,197 --> 00:15:27,308
I'll be observing your mother
for the next few days.

227
00:15:27,366 --> 00:15:28,388
How is she?

228
00:15:29,143 --> 00:15:31,437
We've managed to stabilize
her immediate injuries...

229
00:15:33,330 --> 00:15:35,413
But your mother
suffered a severe head trauma.

230
00:15:36,311 --> 00:15:38,701
We'll have to wait for the swelling
in her brain to go down

231
00:15:38,759 --> 00:15:41,233
before we can determine
the full extent of her injuries.

232
00:15:43,463 --> 00:15:44,514
But...

233
00:15:45,259 --> 00:15:47,748
I'm afraid we're looking
at fairly widespread damage.

234
00:15:49,434 --> 00:15:50,715
What does that mean?

235
00:15:50,923 --> 00:15:54,260
It means that right now these machines
are sustaining her life.

236
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:57,968
But it won't always be...

237
00:15:59,337 --> 00:16:00,889
I mean, when she wakes up, she won't...

238
00:16:00,890 --> 00:16:03,009
I can't say with any real confidence

239
00:16:04,594 --> 00:16:05,705
that she will wake up.

240
00:16:22,218 --> 00:16:23,218
Can she hear us?

241
00:16:23,771 --> 00:16:25,104
I like to think she can.

242
00:16:25,774 --> 00:16:27,496
How long will she be like this?

243
00:16:28,185 --> 00:16:30,153
Could be a day, a week or years.

244
00:16:30,483 --> 00:16:32,260
We'll just have to wait and see.

245
00:16:33,239 --> 00:16:35,593
But I can assure you,
she'll be well looked after.

246
00:16:35,738 --> 00:16:37,283
Oh, that's very nice,

247
00:16:38,074 --> 00:16:39,444
but we can't pay for that.

248
00:16:39,502 --> 00:16:42,567
Don't worry. Her expenses
have already been taken care of.

249
00:16:47,954 --> 00:16:48,954
By whom?

250
00:16:49,772 --> 00:16:51,971
I've been asked
to keep that confidential.

251
00:17:15,353 --> 00:17:16,357
One...

252
00:17:17,491 --> 00:17:18,533
Two...

253
00:17:30,956 --> 00:17:32,036
Look, I'm sorry.

254
00:17:32,959 --> 00:17:33,982
I'm sorry, man.

255
00:17:35,106 --> 00:17:36,688
What the hell is wrong with you?

256
00:17:36,747 --> 00:17:39,442
I was shooting at a boar.
I had no idea you were out here.

257
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:42,266
- Where's Charlie? Is he with you?
- He's back at the camp.

258
00:17:42,305 --> 00:17:44,714
- I'm really sorry if I frightened--
- So it's just you?

259
00:17:46,022 --> 00:17:47,494
- Aye, it's just me.
- Hunting,

260
00:17:47,687 --> 00:17:50,485
in the exact same spot
as we're setting our trap?

261
00:17:51,708 --> 00:17:53,618
I was following a boar, Claire.

262
00:17:54,752 --> 00:17:56,392
So it's just a coincidence, then.

263
00:17:57,908 --> 00:17:58,908
Where is it?

264
00:18:00,764 --> 00:18:01,764
It got away.

265
00:18:08,234 --> 00:18:10,526
You don't want me to catch the birds,
do you?

266
00:18:10,737 --> 00:18:13,610
You and Charlie-- what's going on?

267
00:18:14,443 --> 00:18:16,332
Why wouldn't I want you
to catch the birds?

268
00:18:31,766 --> 00:18:32,766
What is it?

269
00:18:33,372 --> 00:18:34,372
Don't touch it!

270
00:18:34,822 --> 00:18:36,099
Don't even get near it.

271
00:18:42,337 --> 00:18:43,559
What are these pylons?

272
00:18:45,143 --> 00:18:46,724
What do you think they are?

273
00:18:50,143 --> 00:18:51,309
A security perimeter.

274
00:18:52,497 --> 00:18:54,830
Those sensors on the side
would be triggered

275
00:18:55,257 --> 00:18:56,923
if anyone passed between them.

276
00:19:01,210 --> 00:19:03,209
It's an alarm system or a trap.

277
00:19:04,213 --> 00:19:06,241
Either way,
we'll be safer going around it.

278
00:19:06,418 --> 00:19:07,418
You are right.

279
00:19:07,768 --> 00:19:09,452
It was a security perimeter,

280
00:19:10,243 --> 00:19:13,327
but like everything else on this island,
it hasn't functioned in years.

281
00:19:13,477 --> 00:19:14,588
Of course it hasn't.

282
00:19:17,282 --> 00:19:19,353
If you wish
to waste your time, be my guest.

283
00:19:20,163 --> 00:19:22,285
The pylons encircle the entire barracks.

284
00:19:23,241 --> 00:19:24,730
There is no going around them.

285
00:19:25,638 --> 00:19:27,837
If you don't believe me,
look at your map.

286
00:19:40,968 --> 00:19:42,673
He appears to be telling the truth.

287
00:19:55,107 --> 00:19:56,130
Thank you.

288
00:20:20,557 --> 00:20:21,561
Oh, my god.

289
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:27,740
Sorry.

290
00:20:40,337 --> 00:20:42,378
Looks like he suffered
a cerebral hemorrhage.

291
00:20:42,575 --> 00:20:44,447
Why did you do that? We needed him!

292
00:20:46,555 --> 00:20:48,214
They were never
gonna trade him for Jack.

293
00:20:48,215 --> 00:20:50,477
- You don't know that.
- You don't know it, either.

294
00:20:50,618 --> 00:20:53,486
What we do know
is that he shot one of his own people

295
00:20:53,544 --> 00:20:55,571
who didn't want to be
in this exact situation,

296
00:20:55,783 --> 00:20:58,471
- so I'm gonna stick with my opinion.
- We could have discussed it.

297
00:20:58,491 --> 00:21:01,275
Nobody asked me about it when
we brought him along in the 1st place.

298
00:21:01,276 --> 00:21:02,298
All right.

299
00:21:02,435 --> 00:21:07,844
Pardon me for not knowing
that they had a sonic weapon fence.

300
00:21:08,344 --> 00:21:10,665
I didn't know he was gonna die.
How would I know that?

301
00:21:11,098 --> 00:21:12,431
Why are you really here?

302
00:21:13,498 --> 00:21:14,720
Are you here for Jack?

303
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:17,496
Why else would I be here?

304
00:21:19,333 --> 00:21:20,888
We'll talk about this later.

305
00:21:21,635 --> 00:21:22,635
Fine by me.

306
00:21:23,090 --> 00:21:24,904
Just tell me
how we're gonna go through this.

307
00:21:24,943 --> 00:21:26,409
We're not gonna go through it.

308
00:21:26,461 --> 00:21:27,572
We're going over it.

309
00:21:29,721 --> 00:21:30,943
Sayid, where's the ax?

310
00:21:31,072 --> 00:21:32,072
It's in his pack.

311
00:21:32,310 --> 00:21:33,621
No, wait a minute. I got it.

312
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:34,679
Here, I got it.

313
00:21:46,351 --> 00:21:48,615
I thought
you didn't know there was any c-4.

314
00:21:50,002 --> 00:21:51,335
Well, I stand corrected.

315
00:21:52,552 --> 00:21:53,663
Why did you take it?

316
00:21:54,855 --> 00:21:57,446
You never know
when a little c-4 might come in handy.

317
00:21:58,812 --> 00:22:00,556
You'll have to do better than that.

318
00:22:11,125 --> 00:22:12,321
Okay, there you go.

319
00:22:14,481 --> 00:22:16,083
What's going on with you, Charlie?

320
00:22:16,944 --> 00:22:20,204
- I just put Aaron down
- No, you and Desmond,

321
00:22:20,343 --> 00:22:21,343
what's going on?

322
00:22:22,254 --> 00:22:24,783
- What you're talking about.
- So you don't know anything about

323
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:27,136
Desmond shooting off his gun
and scaring away the birds?

324
00:22:28,305 --> 00:22:30,224
I've been with Aaron all morning.

325
00:22:30,257 --> 00:22:32,459
- You're lying to me, Charlie.
- I am not lying.

326
00:22:35,417 --> 00:22:37,691
What happened to the guy
who woke up this morning

327
00:22:37,901 --> 00:22:40,390
who wanted to go and have
a picnic and seize the day?

328
00:22:40,522 --> 00:22:42,410
You really want to know the truth?

329
00:22:43,728 --> 00:22:45,654
That glint you saw
could have been anything--

330
00:22:45,730 --> 00:22:48,545
a piece of glass
stuck in the bird's foot...

331
00:22:48,734 --> 00:22:50,789
or it could have been nothing at all.

332
00:22:52,495 --> 00:22:55,606
I don't want to advocate false hope,
Claire, that's all.

333
00:22:57,596 --> 00:22:59,124
Well, I'm sorry

334
00:22:59,283 --> 00:23:02,491
I bothered you with my stupid ideas,
and, it won't ever happen again.

335
00:23:03,054 --> 00:23:05,319
And, Charlie,
I don't want my baby around lies.

336
00:23:05,446 --> 00:23:08,321
- I think you might be overreacting.
- Overreacting?

337
00:23:09,091 --> 00:23:12,112
No, I thought you were here for me,
that I could count on you.

338
00:23:12,542 --> 00:23:14,153
- I was wrong.
- No, Claire!

339
00:23:14,307 --> 00:23:17,042
I'm on my own,
and at least I know that now.

340
00:23:18,551 --> 00:23:19,766
Just go!

341
00:23:30,095 --> 00:23:31,095
Morning, dear.

342
00:23:31,397 --> 00:23:32,897
Oh, I like your new doctor.

343
00:23:33,398 --> 00:23:34,398
What new doctor?

344
00:23:34,552 --> 00:23:35,552
Oh, the American.

345
00:23:35,951 --> 00:23:37,395
He's in with your mum now.

346
00:23:52,225 --> 00:23:53,225
Excuse me.

347
00:24:01,678 --> 00:24:02,777
The nurse said...

348
00:24:04,955 --> 00:24:05,969
Are you a doctor?

349
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:09,180
Yes...

350
00:24:15,690 --> 00:24:17,373
I'm very sorry. I shouldn't be...

351
00:24:17,992 --> 00:24:20,549
disturbing you. I was just leaving.

352
00:24:21,748 --> 00:24:23,244
What are you doing here?

353
00:24:24,104 --> 00:24:25,648
I was just on my way out, Lindsey.

354
00:24:25,797 --> 00:24:27,792
- If Carole knew you were here...
- She'd what?

355
00:24:28,650 --> 00:24:31,762
What would she do?
She wouldn't be acting the way you are.

356
00:24:31,913 --> 00:24:33,193
Aunt Lindsey,

357
00:24:33,752 --> 00:24:35,576
what's going on here? Who is he?

358
00:24:37,519 --> 00:24:38,519
It doesn't matter.

359
00:24:39,074 --> 00:24:41,869
- Just go.
- Maybe you should tell her, Lindsey.

360
00:24:42,126 --> 00:24:44,979
- She deserves to know.
- Please, just leave us alone.

361
00:24:45,071 --> 00:24:47,348
You are not the arbiter here.

362
00:24:47,709 --> 00:24:49,888
- In these circumstances--
- You are taking advantage

363
00:24:49,889 --> 00:24:51,774
- of my sister's situation--
- I believe Claire

364
00:24:51,812 --> 00:24:53,609
- has every right to know--
- just stop it!

365
00:24:55,249 --> 00:24:57,188
Are you the one paying the bills?

366
00:24:57,557 --> 00:24:59,679
Are you the one taking care of all this?

367
00:25:03,362 --> 00:25:04,362
Yes.

368
00:25:11,601 --> 00:25:12,759
Then who are you?

369
00:25:19,616 --> 00:25:20,986
I'm your father, Claire.

370
00:25:55,722 --> 00:25:58,018
The system appears to fire a sonic pulse

371
00:25:58,488 --> 00:26:01,042
when an object
breaks the plane between two pylons.

372
00:26:01,158 --> 00:26:02,173
So...

373
00:26:03,252 --> 00:26:04,862
as long as we don't break the plane,

374
00:26:05,201 --> 00:26:06,645
we should remain unharmed.

375
00:26:06,752 --> 00:26:08,964
Why not just use
the plastic explosive you took?

376
00:26:09,056 --> 00:26:11,281
Be my guest.
You wanna go stick it on there?

377
00:26:11,903 --> 00:26:14,990
Whoever climbs over,
give those sensors a wide berth.

378
00:26:15,241 --> 00:26:16,457
I'll go first.

379
00:26:19,713 --> 00:26:20,812
Give me a hand.

380
00:27:21,164 --> 00:27:22,330
I guess I'll go next.

381
00:27:58,644 --> 00:27:59,743
Here you go.

382
00:28:00,570 --> 00:28:01,570
Thanks.

383
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:07,045
You have every right to be upset.

384
00:28:07,132 --> 00:28:08,854
It just doesn't make any sense.

385
00:28:09,583 --> 00:28:11,860
Desmond's never gone
boar hunting before,

386
00:28:12,337 --> 00:28:14,358
and the boar
never come that close to the beach.

387
00:28:14,436 --> 00:28:16,672
Well, whatever is going on,

388
00:28:17,054 --> 00:28:18,838
they're still talking about it.

389
00:28:25,976 --> 00:28:26,976
Can you watch him?

390
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:28,928
What are you going to do?

391
00:28:31,634 --> 00:28:32,634
Get some answers.

392
00:28:39,798 --> 00:28:41,242
I'll be with you in a sec.

393
00:28:45,986 --> 00:28:47,105
There you go.

394
00:28:48,179 --> 00:28:49,179
It'll be 10 bucks.

395
00:29:01,147 --> 00:29:02,480
What are you doing here?

396
00:29:03,104 --> 00:29:04,437
Buy you a cup of coffee?

397
00:29:08,260 --> 00:29:09,632
I have nothing to say to you.

398
00:29:10,616 --> 00:29:13,123
I'm leaving tonight,
then I'll be out of your life forever.

399
00:29:13,181 --> 00:29:15,631
Just one cup of coffee.

400
00:29:24,357 --> 00:29:25,495
So it's true.

401
00:29:27,678 --> 00:29:29,607
Yes, it's true.

402
00:29:36,396 --> 00:29:38,300
How'd you find out about the accident?

403
00:29:38,703 --> 00:29:40,673
A doctor friend here in Sydney told me.

404
00:29:40,751 --> 00:29:43,399
I got the call the minute your mother
went into surgery.

405
00:29:47,415 --> 00:29:49,349
Why did she tell me that you're dead?

406
00:29:51,375 --> 00:29:52,875
Well, because I--no doubt--

407
00:29:53,324 --> 00:29:55,716
left her
with so many wonderful memories.

408
00:29:58,929 --> 00:30:01,017
Look, we had a fling.

409
00:30:01,782 --> 00:30:04,125
I was back in Los Angeles
when she told me

410
00:30:04,271 --> 00:30:06,554
that she was pregnant,
that she was going to have the baby...

411
00:30:06,603 --> 00:30:08,194
- have you.
- You didn't--

412
00:30:09,004 --> 00:30:10,341
You didn't want to see me?

413
00:30:10,863 --> 00:30:13,535
No. I came out a bunch of times
when you were little.

414
00:30:14,751 --> 00:30:15,961
I stayed over,

415
00:30:17,138 --> 00:30:18,257
gave you toys.

416
00:30:19,058 --> 00:30:20,175
I sang to you.

417
00:30:23,376 --> 00:30:24,572
Why'd you stop coming?

418
00:30:27,071 --> 00:30:28,584
'cause your aunt hates me,

419
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:31,507
and your mother
didn't like the fact that I,

420
00:30:31,928 --> 00:30:33,094
I had another family.

421
00:30:34,432 --> 00:30:36,641
Why are you here now, then?
Why'd you come?

422
00:30:36,718 --> 00:30:39,130
You could've just paid her bills
from the states.

423
00:30:39,188 --> 00:30:41,971
I came over because I wanted to help.

424
00:30:42,393 --> 00:30:43,393
Help with what?

425
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:47,721
Your mother is alive...

426
00:30:50,606 --> 00:30:52,161
but she's not really living.

427
00:30:53,058 --> 00:30:54,323
What that's supposed to mean?

428
00:30:54,356 --> 00:30:56,912
It means that now may be the time

429
00:30:57,263 --> 00:31:00,717
to look at other alternatives,
other ways to relieve her pain.

430
00:31:01,473 --> 00:31:04,210
Now it is illegal
to turn off her machines,

431
00:31:04,273 --> 00:31:07,310
but I know of ways
that can achieve the same effect

432
00:31:07,382 --> 00:31:09,366
- without the legal consequences.
- Just stop it!

433
00:31:09,424 --> 00:31:11,713
- So...
You didn't come here to help me.

434
00:31:12,334 --> 00:31:14,906
You came here to try and fix
a mistake that you made.

435
00:31:14,921 --> 00:31:15,989
No, honey, that's not true.

436
00:31:15,990 --> 00:31:18,850
You think that just paying her bills
makes you noble or something?

437
00:31:20,247 --> 00:31:21,521
You come down here,

438
00:31:22,061 --> 00:31:23,626
and you try and get me to kill her?

439
00:31:28,257 --> 00:31:29,432
You know, just go.

440
00:31:29,910 --> 00:31:32,564
Why don't you just go?
Go back to your real family.

441
00:31:36,592 --> 00:31:37,711
You know...

442
00:31:39,857 --> 00:31:41,342
You might be my father...

443
00:31:44,396 --> 00:31:45,978
But I don't even know your name...

444
00:31:48,551 --> 00:31:51,400
And I, um, I want it to stay that way.

445
00:31:55,362 --> 00:31:56,461
Listen to me.

446
00:31:57,764 --> 00:32:00,900
Do not keep your mother alive
for the wrong reasons.

447
00:32:01,228 --> 00:32:04,088
Now there is hope and there is guilt,
and believe me,

448
00:32:05,046 --> 00:32:06,681
I know the difference.

449
00:32:15,138 --> 00:32:16,138
Good-bye, kiddo.

450
00:32:17,242 --> 00:32:18,797
It's great seeing you again.

451
00:33:01,118 --> 00:33:02,873
What the hell are you doing?

452
00:33:03,922 --> 00:33:04,922
You followed me.

453
00:33:07,776 --> 00:33:09,220
Stay back!

454
00:33:09,779 --> 00:33:11,001
It's one of the birds.

455
00:33:11,181 --> 00:33:12,181
Stay back!

456
00:33:31,116 --> 00:33:33,116
How did you know it was gonna be here?

457
00:33:33,211 --> 00:33:34,211
I didn't.

458
00:33:34,665 --> 00:33:35,665
Yes, you did.

459
00:33:36,217 --> 00:33:37,217
You had to.

460
00:33:37,968 --> 00:33:40,579
That's what you and Charlie
were arguing about.

461
00:33:42,476 --> 00:33:43,476
You knew.

462
00:33:45,233 --> 00:33:46,593
- How would I?
- I don't know,

463
00:33:46,631 --> 00:33:48,580
but you know,
you walked straight here...

464
00:33:49,487 --> 00:33:51,839
no doubt at all
about where you were going.

465
00:33:51,890 --> 00:33:54,957
You came right to this beach
and right to this rock,

466
00:33:55,941 --> 00:33:57,986
and low and behold, there's the bird.

467
00:33:59,502 --> 00:34:01,335
What t hell is going on, Desmond?

468
00:34:09,818 --> 00:34:11,206
See that spot over there?

469
00:34:16,178 --> 00:34:18,455
That's where Charlie slipped
and fell in.

470
00:34:19,797 --> 00:34:22,344
He got pounded again and again
by the rocks and...

471
00:34:23,685 --> 00:34:24,685
broke his neck.

472
00:34:26,191 --> 00:34:27,191
What?

473
00:34:27,893 --> 00:34:29,635
What--what are you talking about?

474
00:34:31,398 --> 00:34:32,842
That's where Charlie died.

475
00:34:46,509 --> 00:34:47,842
Look what Desmond found.

476
00:34:49,006 --> 00:34:50,006
How about that?

477
00:34:51,664 --> 00:34:52,719
It does have a tag.

478
00:34:53,466 --> 00:34:54,466
You were right.

479
00:35:00,073 --> 00:35:01,624
Desmond told me everything

480
00:35:05,386 --> 00:35:06,775
about all his visions...

481
00:35:08,786 --> 00:35:11,508
That he knew you were gonna get hit
by lightning,

482
00:35:14,615 --> 00:35:17,721
that you were gonna drown
trying to rescue me in the ocean...

483
00:35:23,206 --> 00:35:25,428
how you died trying to get me this bird.

484
00:35:26,611 --> 00:35:28,316
You don't believe all that, do you?

485
00:35:53,610 --> 00:35:55,418
Now who turned the telly off?

486
00:35:55,985 --> 00:35:58,725
Don't they know how much
you love your nature shows?

487
00:36:01,731 --> 00:36:02,731
That's better.

488
00:36:06,535 --> 00:36:07,979
So how are you today, mum?

489
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:11,040
Did you have an okay night?

490
00:36:29,270 --> 00:36:30,845
Something I have to tell you,

491
00:36:31,110 --> 00:36:33,772
something I should have told you
a long time ago.

492
00:36:42,236 --> 00:36:43,236
I'm pregnant.

493
00:36:50,798 --> 00:36:52,284
I'm giving it away.

494
00:36:55,057 --> 00:36:56,762
It's for the best.

495
00:37:04,069 --> 00:37:05,069
I wish...

496
00:37:11,572 --> 00:37:13,092
I don't know how you did it--

497
00:37:14,757 --> 00:37:16,146
raising me alone.

498
00:37:17,787 --> 00:37:19,342
That must have been so hard,

499
00:37:21,787 --> 00:37:22,926
and I was just...

500
00:37:24,009 --> 00:37:25,009
awful...

501
00:37:30,826 --> 00:37:31,971
So horrible to you.

502
00:37:38,376 --> 00:37:39,760
I'm so sorry, mum.

503
00:37:50,501 --> 00:37:54,148
So sorry for all the awful things
I said to you in the car...

504
00:37:57,104 --> 00:37:57,960
That...

505
00:37:59,641 --> 00:38:00,730
I hated you...

506
00:38:04,172 --> 00:38:06,024
and that I wished
you weren't my mother...

507
00:38:06,863 --> 00:38:08,792
and that I wished you were dead.

508
00:38:10,855 --> 00:38:12,283
It's all my fault--

509
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:14,781
the accident,

510
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:16,688
everything.

511
00:38:23,352 --> 00:38:25,012
I'm so sorry, mom.

512
00:38:38,916 --> 00:38:40,412
I'll see you soon, okay?

513
00:38:43,059 --> 00:38:44,814
"To whom it may concern,

514
00:38:45,126 --> 00:38:48,533
"we are survivors of Oceanic flight 815.

515
00:38:51,012 --> 00:38:53,737
"We have survived
on this island
for 80 days.

516
00:38:55,940 --> 00:38:57,341
"We were six hours into the flight

517
00:38:57,396 --> 00:38:59,056
"when the pilot said we were off course

518
00:38:59,094 --> 00:39:01,004
"and turned back towards Fiji.

519
00:39:03,653 --> 00:39:05,247
"We hit turbulence and crashed.

520
00:39:06,972 --> 00:39:09,406
"We've been waiting here all this time--

521
00:39:10,430 --> 00:39:12,629
"waiting for rescue that has not come.

522
00:39:14,169 --> 00:39:17,618
"We do not know where we are.
We only know you have not found us.

523
00:39:19,752 --> 00:39:22,267
"We've done our best
to live on this island.

524
00:39:22,479 --> 00:39:25,479
"Some of us have come
to accept we may never leave it.

525
00:39:28,499 --> 00:39:31,138
"Not all of us have survived
since the crash,

526
00:39:32,494 --> 00:39:34,424
"but there is new life, too,

527
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:37,202
"and with it, there is hope.

528
00:39:38,151 --> 00:39:39,584
"We are alive.

529
00:39:42,991 --> 00:39:44,764
