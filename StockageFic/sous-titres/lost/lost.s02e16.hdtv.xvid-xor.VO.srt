1
00:00:00,626 --> 00:00:01,180
Previously on "lost"...

2
00:00:01,210 --> 00:00:02,336
help me!

3
00:00:02,419 --> 00:00:03,269
he's one of them.

4
00:00:03,295 --> 00:00:05,839
My name is henry gale.
I'm from minnesota.

5
00:00:05,923 --> 00:00:07,674
You're making a
serious mistake.

6
00:00:08,634 --> 00:00:11,595
For a long time, he will lie.

7
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:15,432
He is one of them.

8
00:00:21,855 --> 00:00:23,649
She's okay.

9
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:24,786
She's gonna be all right.

10
00:00:24,816 --> 00:00:27,366
- Where did you find her?
- Just outside our garden.

11
00:00:37,122 --> 00:00:38,620


12
00:00:40,912 --> 00:00:42,338


13
00:00:51,348 --> 00:00:53,479


14
00:00:54,763 --> 00:00:56,265


15
00:00:58,016 --> 00:00:59,226


16
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:00,978


17
00:01:01,937 --> 00:01:05,023


18
00:01:30,424 --> 00:01:31,925


19
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:36,847


20
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:38,015


21
00:01:38,442 --> 00:01:43,645


22
00:01:47,983 --> 00:01:49,651


23
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:51,987


24
00:01:52,487 --> 00:01:54,072


25
00:01:57,201 --> 00:02:00,829


26
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:02,372


27
00:02:02,706 --> 00:02:03,624


28
00:02:03,665 --> 00:02:04,541


29
00:02:04,708 --> 00:02:07,961


30
00:02:08,212 --> 00:02:11,173


31
00:02:12,591 --> 00:02:14,801


32
00:02:15,427 --> 00:02:17,387


33
00:02:26,605 --> 00:02:28,148


34
00:02:30,526 --> 00:02:32,194


35
00:02:35,864 --> 00:02:37,574


36
00:02:38,951 --> 00:02:41,411


37
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:45,499


38
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:49,086


39
00:02:59,304 --> 00:03:01,932


40
00:03:06,103 --> 00:03:09,731


41
00:03:30,586 --> 00:03:31,378


42
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:32,963


43
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:34,631


44
00:03:34,715 --> 00:03:36,091


45
00:03:37,009 --> 00:03:39,678


46
00:03:40,345 --> 00:03:42,014


47
00:03:42,097 --> 00:03:44,099


48
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:46,476


49
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:49,229


50
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:50,189


51
00:03:50,564 --> 00:03:52,441


52
00:03:52,983 --> 00:03:54,735


53
00:03:54,902 --> 00:03:56,153


54
00:03:56,612 --> 00:03:59,072


55
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:04,369


56
00:04:06,121 --> 00:04:06,872


57
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:09,124


58
00:04:13,212 --> 00:04:14,588


59
00:04:19,343 --> 00:04:21,345


60
00:04:25,057 --> 00:04:26,767


61
00:05:03,387 --> 00:05:06,306
You were running like
the devil's chasing you.

62
00:05:08,058 --> 00:05:09,893
Maybe he is.

63
00:05:11,353 --> 00:05:13,355
Good for you, keeping in shape.

64
00:05:14,064 --> 00:05:15,816
What do you want, Locke?

65
00:05:17,109 --> 00:05:18,485
What do I want?

66
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:20,320
I've been here over a week.

67
00:05:20,529 --> 00:05:22,447
You've never said
two words to me,

68
00:05:22,614 --> 00:05:24,700
and now you're sitting
outside my tent?

69
00:05:26,535 --> 00:05:29,162
We got a man locked
up down in the hatch.

70
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:31,790
There's a possibility
he's one of them--

71
00:05:31,999 --> 00:05:33,166
the others.

72
00:05:33,417 --> 00:05:35,878
- Who's we?
- Me and Jack.

73
00:05:36,461 --> 00:05:38,005
He's keeping watch right now.

74
00:05:39,173 --> 00:05:41,341
How long has he
been down there?

75
00:05:41,633 --> 00:05:42,759
Three days.

76
00:05:44,553 --> 00:05:46,805
I'd like you to talk with him.

77
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:50,767
You have experience with the others.
You were a cop.

78
00:05:50,851 --> 00:05:53,282
Seems to me you're the most
qualified to figure out

79
00:05:53,312 --> 00:05:55,647
if this man's
telling the truth.

80
00:05:55,939 --> 00:05:58,525
Does jack know you're
coming to me with this?

81
00:06:01,695 --> 00:06:05,324
We got a serious problem,
Ana Lucia--

82
00:06:05,449 --> 00:06:06,450
all of us.

83
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:11,872
I'm taking the necessary
steps to solve it.

84
00:06:11,997 --> 00:06:14,397
I don't need Jack's
permission to talk with you,

85
00:06:14,416 --> 00:06:17,711
because right now, there's a man
sitting in a room in my hatch,

86
00:06:17,794 --> 00:06:19,796
and I want him out.

87
00:06:31,558 --> 00:06:35,187
It's the thought that counts,
and you just didn't think.

88
00:06:35,354 --> 00:06:36,855
I think all the time.

89
00:06:37,022 --> 00:06:39,661
Maybe you should think about giving
me a little bit of a break here.

90
00:06:39,691 --> 00:06:41,902
Oh,  just hush, Bernard.
Just hush.

91
00:06:43,153 --> 00:06:44,446
Honey?

92
00:06:45,989 --> 00:06:47,199
Are you all right?

93
00:06:47,991 --> 00:06:52,704
I'm... I think I'm just
a little lightheaded.

94
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:54,540
Well, you look as
pale as a sheet.

95
00:06:54,665 --> 00:06:56,416
Well, give her some water.

96
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,126
Yes, ma'am.

97
00:06:58,502 --> 00:07:00,002
Don't pay him any mind, honey.

98
00:07:00,128 --> 00:07:04,216
He's just mad at the world
because he forgot my birthday.

99
00:07:04,299 --> 00:07:05,676
I didn't forget.

100
00:07:05,843 --> 00:07:07,898
I don't even know what day
of the week it is, Rose.

101
00:07:07,928 --> 00:07:09,847
It's saturday, Bernard.

102
00:07:09,972 --> 00:07:11,306
Can you walk, honey?

103
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:13,433
Really, I'm all right.

104
00:07:13,559 --> 00:07:14,909
Maybe we should go get jin.

105
00:07:15,018 --> 00:07:15,686
No!

106
00:07:18,105 --> 00:07:20,899
I think I was just out
in the sun too long.

107
00:07:21,692 --> 00:07:23,622
Well, you spend a lot of
time around the baby.

108
00:07:23,652 --> 00:07:26,196
Maybe you caught something.
At least talk to Jack.

109
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:31,660
Really, I'm okay.
Thank you, both of you.

110
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:10,699


111
00:08:12,659 --> 00:08:14,077


112
00:08:14,953 --> 00:08:16,997


113
00:08:18,624 --> 00:08:19,499


114
00:08:20,584 --> 00:08:22,586


115
00:08:22,669 --> 00:08:24,379


116
00:08:32,429 --> 00:08:35,557


117
00:08:37,267 --> 00:08:40,979


118
00:08:41,313 --> 00:08:42,814


119
00:08:43,774 --> 00:08:46,235


120
00:08:47,277 --> 00:08:48,946
 

121
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:51,323


122
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:53,075
In english?

123
00:08:54,868 --> 00:08:55,869
I'll...

124
00:08:56,411 --> 00:08:57,246
hmm.

125
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:04,628
I would like an
iced tea. Please.

126
00:09:04,795 --> 00:09:07,339
- Very good.
- Thank you.

127
00:09:11,927 --> 00:09:13,053


128
00:09:13,136 --> 00:09:14,054


129
00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:16,890


130
00:09:17,683 --> 00:09:19,268


131
00:09:20,644 --> 00:09:22,604


132
00:09:23,522 --> 00:09:26,149


133
00:09:27,985 --> 00:09:31,405


134
00:09:32,823 --> 00:09:35,325


135
00:09:35,409 --> 00:09:37,870


136
00:09:38,829 --> 00:09:42,291


137
00:09:44,376 --> 00:09:45,794


138
00:09:45,961 --> 00:09:46,587


139
00:09:52,259 --> 00:09:55,220


140
00:10:07,065 --> 00:10:08,317
Morning, Jack.

141
00:10:10,652 --> 00:10:13,822
You couldn't wait until
I was done in here?

142
00:10:14,281 --> 00:10:16,408
The steam opens up my pores.

143
00:10:17,242 --> 00:10:20,329
Man's got no shaving cream,
he's got to improvise.

144
00:10:20,492 --> 00:10:23,580
I also thought this
might be a good time

145
00:10:23,792 --> 00:10:25,458
to talk about our problem.

146
00:10:25,548 --> 00:10:27,879
- Our problem.
- Our Henry problem.

147
00:10:28,003 --> 00:10:30,255
We've had him locked
up for three days now,

148
00:10:30,339 --> 00:10:34,343
and I can't help but get
the sense that he's just not

149
00:10:34,426 --> 00:10:35,689
motivated to cooperate with us.

150
00:10:35,719 --> 00:10:37,719
And how are we gonna
motivate him, John?

151
00:10:37,763 --> 00:10:39,813
I don't think there's
anything we can do.

152
00:10:39,848 --> 00:10:41,998
I think we need to
bring in some new blood.

153
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:44,353
Obviously you have
someone in mind.

154
00:10:44,436 --> 00:10:46,438
What do you think
about Ana Lucia?

155
00:10:47,814 --> 00:10:49,024
Why her?

156
00:10:49,858 --> 00:10:53,362
She's the one you went to to start
an army to fight these people.

157
00:10:53,487 --> 00:10:54,738
Why not her?

158
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:58,242
Unless you're worried about
what she'll do to him.

159
00:11:01,537 --> 00:11:02,996
I'll talk to her.

160
00:11:03,163 --> 00:11:04,623
I already did.

161
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:08,252
She's in there with him now.

162
00:11:14,842 --> 00:11:16,885
Were you on the plane, too?

163
00:11:18,637 --> 00:11:20,556
I was in the tail section.

164
00:11:21,348 --> 00:11:23,498
We crashed on the other
side of the island.

165
00:11:24,309 --> 00:11:27,020
You walked across?
All the way here?

166
00:11:29,106 --> 00:11:31,233
That must have been fun.

167
00:11:31,358 --> 00:11:33,277
It had its moments.

168
00:11:35,028 --> 00:11:37,364
So are you gonna tell
me your story, Henry?

169
00:11:37,531 --> 00:11:39,950
Why bother?
I've already told it to everyone--

170
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:43,537
Jack, Locke, the big black guy that
cut off his beard in front of me.

171
00:11:43,662 --> 00:11:45,539
Oh, yeah, and my buddy Sayid.

172
00:11:45,706 --> 00:11:48,208
You  can see how much
he liked my story.

173
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:50,085
So how about you try me?

174
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:52,212
I don't mean to be
ungrateful, but

175
00:11:52,337 --> 00:11:54,715
why are you gonna help
me get out of here?

176
00:11:55,757 --> 00:11:58,343
On the other side
of the island,

177
00:11:58,719 --> 00:12:00,345
there was this guy with us.

178
00:12:00,429 --> 00:12:04,183
I was 100% convinced that
he wasn't on the plane.

179
00:12:04,558 --> 00:12:08,729
So I dug a hole,
and I threw him in it.

180
00:12:10,272 --> 00:12:11,940
And what happened?

181
00:12:13,275 --> 00:12:15,068
I was wrong.

182
00:12:16,111 --> 00:12:18,030
And now he's dead.

183
00:12:19,823 --> 00:12:21,575
But good news for you, Henry--

184
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:24,244
I don't make the
same mistake twice.

185
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:26,955
So how about you
tell me your story?

186
00:12:35,005 --> 00:12:36,089
Sawyer?

187
00:12:39,676 --> 00:12:41,470
Well, hey there, sunshine.

188
00:12:41,803 --> 00:12:43,305
What can I do for you?

189
00:12:44,014 --> 00:12:45,599
How's your book?

190
00:12:46,517 --> 00:12:47,643
Predictable.

191
00:12:48,268 --> 00:12:50,771
Not nearly enough sex.

192
00:12:56,151 --> 00:13:00,447
I heard that you have all the,
uh, medical supplies.

193
00:13:02,074 --> 00:13:04,493
You heard correct.

194
00:13:04,826 --> 00:13:06,245
May I look through them?

195
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:10,874
No, you may not. But if you'll
tell me what you're lookin' for...

196
00:13:10,958 --> 00:13:12,584
Forget it.

197
00:13:14,545 --> 00:13:17,089
Okay, hold on.

198
00:13:17,881 --> 00:13:19,800
Now I'm intrigued.

199
00:13:20,592 --> 00:13:21,885
Tell you what--

200
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:25,055
tell me what you're lookin' for,
and it's yours. Gratis.

201
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:27,182
Can't I just look myself?

202
00:13:27,349 --> 00:13:29,268
It's not a
drugstore, sweetheart.

203
00:13:35,899 --> 00:13:37,609
I need...

204
00:13:40,821 --> 00:13:43,448
a pregnancy test.

205
00:13:54,251 --> 00:13:55,752
I can't hear anything.

206
00:13:55,878 --> 00:13:58,005
She's only been in
there about 30 minutes.

207
00:13:58,255 --> 00:14:00,227
How do you know he hasn't
snapped her neck, John?

208
00:14:00,257 --> 00:14:02,467
How do you know she
hasn't snapped his?

209
00:14:03,302 --> 00:14:04,752
So let me get this straight--

210
00:14:04,845 --> 00:14:07,645
you and your wife travel around
the world and crash here

211
00:14:07,723 --> 00:14:10,851
in  a smiley face balloon.
Then she dies.

212
00:14:10,934 --> 00:14:13,854
You get captured by a french
chick who brings you here,

213
00:14:13,937 --> 00:14:15,564
and then they lock you up.

214
00:14:16,023 --> 00:14:18,650
Sounds kind of silly when
you say it like that.

215
00:14:18,734 --> 00:14:20,235
Why don't you have a beard?

216
00:14:20,402 --> 00:14:22,487
Because I shaved.

217
00:14:22,988 --> 00:14:25,657
Because I needed
something normal.

218
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:26,867
Okay.

219
00:14:28,076 --> 00:14:31,371
So why don't you draw me
a map to your balloon?

220
00:14:31,455 --> 00:14:34,755
We'll go out there. We'll find it,
and everybody will believe you.

221
00:14:34,833 --> 00:14:37,533
That's what they all keep
asking me to do--draw a map.

222
00:14:37,544 --> 00:14:39,266
And if I mess up,
they'll crucify me.

223
00:14:39,296 --> 00:14:41,798
You flew around the
world in a balloon.

224
00:14:41,965 --> 00:14:44,104
And you don't think you
can draw up a good map?

225
00:14:44,134 --> 00:14:45,594
Air travel...

226
00:14:45,719 --> 00:14:48,269
it's a different animal.
It's about wind currents--

227
00:14:48,305 --> 00:14:51,725
Do you or do you not
know where it is?

228
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:53,852
Yeah,  I know where it is.

229
00:14:56,939 --> 00:15:00,609
I went back there
to bury my wife.

230
00:15:03,403 --> 00:15:05,656
Why did you do that?

231
00:15:06,031 --> 00:15:10,285
Because that balloon was the
closest thing we had to home.

232
00:15:13,872 --> 00:15:17,930
You people have been looking for someone
to punish for everything that's happened
to you--

233
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:21,255
someone to blame.
And now you've got him.

234
00:15:22,589 --> 00:15:26,093
Doesn't matter what I do.
I'm dead already.

235
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:32,933
You draw up that map, henry.

236
00:15:33,016 --> 00:15:35,310
I'll find your balloon.

237
00:15:36,353 --> 00:15:38,522
But if you don't...

238
00:15:39,314 --> 00:15:43,235
things are gonna play
out just like you said.

239
00:16:07,426 --> 00:16:08,844
Hey, sun.

240
00:16:12,139 --> 00:16:14,725
Look what I found in the
middle of the jungle.

241
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:17,227
It's not even
melted or nothing.

242
00:16:17,352 --> 00:16:18,645
Crazy, huh?

243
00:16:21,481 --> 00:16:23,150
You want to split it?

244
00:16:23,775 --> 00:16:26,528
No. No, thank you.

245
00:16:28,363 --> 00:16:30,991
I was just heading
to the beach.

246
00:16:32,951 --> 00:16:36,121
Okay. Well, later, dude.

247
00:16:57,893 --> 00:16:59,478


248
00:17:00,479 --> 00:17:01,772


249
00:17:03,899 --> 00:17:05,567


250
00:17:06,276 --> 00:17:07,736


251
00:17:08,070 --> 00:17:09,613


252
00:17:10,322 --> 00:17:12,199


253
00:17:12,282 --> 00:17:13,283


254
00:17:13,784 --> 00:17:16,620


255
00:17:16,745 --> 00:17:17,788


256
00:17:18,747 --> 00:17:20,332


257
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:29,049


258
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:38,433


259
00:17:40,477 --> 00:17:41,854


260
00:17:42,354 --> 00:17:44,398


261
00:17:44,606 --> 00:17:47,359


262
00:17:48,277 --> 00:17:49,903


263
00:17:53,073 --> 00:17:54,533


264
00:17:54,658 --> 00:17:56,326


265
00:17:57,661 --> 00:18:00,998


266
00:18:02,666 --> 00:18:04,376


267
00:18:11,216 --> 00:18:13,177


268
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:16,972


269
00:18:17,222 --> 00:18:18,891


270
00:18:19,516 --> 00:18:21,518


271
00:18:22,519 --> 00:18:23,812


272
00:18:25,439 --> 00:18:28,275


273
00:18:44,833 --> 00:18:46,126
I need out.

274
00:19:04,478 --> 00:19:06,772
He told me the same
story he told you.

275
00:19:07,731 --> 00:19:08,941
You believe him?

276
00:19:09,024 --> 00:19:09,900
I don't know yet.

277
00:19:09,983 --> 00:19:11,652
I need more time with him.

278
00:19:12,194 --> 00:19:13,529
He's all yours.

279
00:19:13,695 --> 00:19:17,074
Tomorrow. I want to give
him some time to think.

280
00:19:20,869 --> 00:19:22,913
That's okay with you?

281
00:19:24,414 --> 00:19:26,750
I didn't tell anyone, Ana.

282
00:19:27,543 --> 00:19:29,878
No worries, man.

283
00:19:41,557 --> 00:19:43,976
Bit large for a dining room table,
isn't it?

284
00:19:44,101 --> 00:19:46,351
We cut them in two,
it will suit the purpose.

285
00:19:46,812 --> 00:19:50,649
Sayid, can I talk to you?

286
00:19:52,985 --> 00:19:54,319
Of course.

287
00:19:56,613 --> 00:19:58,156
Alone.

288
00:19:59,867 --> 00:20:02,369
Whatever you need to say,
you can say it here.

289
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:04,538
It's about the hatch.

290
00:20:04,673 --> 00:20:07,374
Oh, you mean the guy locked
in the closet there?

291
00:20:09,209 --> 00:20:10,419
What about him?

292
00:20:22,389 --> 00:20:24,850
It's to his balloon.

293
00:20:25,017 --> 00:20:27,186
How did you get him to do this?

294
00:20:27,269 --> 00:20:28,979
I asked nicely.

295
00:20:31,023 --> 00:20:33,066
Do Jack and Locke
know about this?

296
00:20:33,150 --> 00:20:36,820
Jack and Locke are a little too
busy worrying about Locke and Jack.

297
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:42,868
All I want to know is if this
guy's telling the truth.

298
00:20:43,035 --> 00:20:44,453
Why come to me?

299
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:48,373
Judging from what you did to his face,
that's what you want, too.

300
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:52,669
This is at least a day's walk.

301
00:20:52,961 --> 00:20:55,422
Then we should get going.

302
00:21:14,942 --> 00:21:17,861
- You okay?
- Fine. Thank you.

303
00:21:29,164 --> 00:21:33,377
That cliff there
appears to be this.

304
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:34,878
Score one for Henry.

305
00:21:35,045 --> 00:21:39,019
Pointing out a geographical touchstone
does not mean he's leading us to
a balloon.

306
00:21:39,049 --> 00:21:41,927
Maybe not,
but at least we're on the right island.

307
00:21:46,181 --> 00:21:48,350
Humor's not his strong suit.

308
00:21:49,226 --> 00:21:52,396
And I'm saying this to you.

309
00:22:03,156 --> 00:22:04,700
You looking at my bum?

310
00:22:04,867 --> 00:22:06,869
No, I'm looking at your gun.

311
00:22:07,578 --> 00:22:08,453
My what?

312
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:11,920
Maybe you should give the gun to
somebody who knows how to use it.

313
00:22:13,041 --> 00:22:14,293
Maybe I will.

314
00:22:14,418 --> 00:22:17,568
As I recall, the last time you
had a gun, you murdered someone.

315
00:22:17,671 --> 00:22:18,463
That's enough.

316
00:22:30,767 --> 00:22:34,479
We'll go as far as the base of
the cliff, and we'll camp there.

317
00:22:42,821 --> 00:22:44,656
How long is it
supposed to take?

318
00:22:44,865 --> 00:22:46,950
Uh, up to two minutes.

319
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:56,043
- I'm sorry. I'm just--
- I know.

320
00:22:58,170 --> 00:23:00,964
Where did sawyer find
one of these, anyway?

321
00:23:01,048 --> 00:23:04,676
I mean,
who flies with a pregnancy test, right?

322
00:23:05,719 --> 00:23:09,014
Have you ever taken one?

323
00:23:10,974 --> 00:23:11,850
Yeah.

324
00:23:15,729 --> 00:23:18,023
Thank you for
waiting with me...

325
00:23:19,525 --> 00:23:24,238
and not asking why
you're here and not Jin.

326
00:23:25,739 --> 00:23:27,491
You're welcome.

327
00:23:34,081 --> 00:23:35,499
It's time.

328
00:23:50,764 --> 00:23:52,057
You're pregnant.

329
00:23:57,521 --> 00:23:59,898
Is it 100% sure?

330
00:24:01,441 --> 00:24:03,360
There's only one
way to find out.

331
00:24:05,863 --> 00:24:08,323
These tests are
pretty accurate.

332
00:24:08,615 --> 00:24:13,996
You know, false negative in the first
week maybe, but a positive is
a positive.

333
00:24:14,538 --> 00:24:18,083
- But it's impossible.
- Oh, no. It's possible.

334
00:24:19,126 --> 00:24:21,170
You feeling
queasy? Light-headed?

335
00:24:21,295 --> 00:24:25,841
Please, Jack. This is private.
Nobody can know.

336
00:24:26,425 --> 00:24:27,968
You're not gonna tell Jin?

337
00:24:28,093 --> 00:24:31,096
In time, I will. It's just...

338
00:24:33,015 --> 00:24:34,641
it's complicated.

339
00:24:34,808 --> 00:24:39,730
As complicated as Jin being the last one
on the island to find out you
spoke english?

340
00:24:39,855 --> 00:24:42,149
Sun, my advice--

341
00:24:42,232 --> 00:24:45,861
and it's just that, because I'm
the last person to ask about this,

342
00:24:45,944 --> 00:24:47,571
but you should tell him.

343
00:24:47,696 --> 00:24:51,158
And when you do, you should tell
him everything-- the whole truth.

344
00:24:53,493 --> 00:24:57,497
I'm gonna get back to the hatch.
Congratulations, Sun.

345
00:25:00,042 --> 00:25:02,085
You've been down
there a lot, Jack.

346
00:25:03,629 --> 00:25:05,214
Is everything okay?

347
00:25:05,964 --> 00:25:09,468
Sure. Yeah. Everything's fine.

348
00:25:14,765 --> 00:25:16,475
You okay?

349
00:25:18,435 --> 00:25:19,144
Sun?

350
00:25:22,022 --> 00:25:22,731
Sun?

351
00:25:24,942 --> 00:25:25,484
Sun?

352
00:25:29,613 --> 00:25:31,114
Sun, are you all right?

353
00:25:34,535 --> 00:25:36,119
Yes, I'm fine.

354
00:25:36,495 --> 00:25:38,705
You were distracted
for our entire lesson.

355
00:25:39,164 --> 00:25:40,624
You're not fine.

356
00:25:47,548 --> 00:25:48,465
We...

357
00:25:50,175 --> 00:25:52,678
Jin and I went to see a doctor.

358
00:25:55,639 --> 00:25:58,642
He said I cannot have children.

359
00:25:59,852 --> 00:26:02,354
I'm... very sorry, Sun.

360
00:26:05,357 --> 00:26:06,692
I was glad.

361
00:26:10,279 --> 00:26:11,822


362
00:26:14,366 --> 00:26:16,869


363
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:19,955


364
00:26:21,123 --> 00:26:22,666


365
00:26:26,879 --> 00:26:27,963


366
00:26:31,758 --> 00:26:33,302


367
00:26:36,221 --> 00:26:38,932


368
00:26:42,978 --> 00:26:45,731


369
00:26:46,231 --> 00:26:47,983


370
00:26:49,610 --> 00:26:52,821


371
00:26:59,203 --> 00:27:01,747


372
00:27:03,832 --> 00:27:05,000


373
00:27:05,083 --> 00:27:09,588
I'm not saying you
should stay for jin.

374
00:27:36,949 --> 00:27:38,408
You mind?

375
00:27:47,876 --> 00:27:49,670
You should sleep while you can.

376
00:27:50,379 --> 00:27:52,965
Yeah... I can't sleep.

377
00:28:01,348 --> 00:28:03,141
People don't like me.

378
00:28:06,812 --> 00:28:09,648
I've tried to get them
to most of my life.

379
00:28:12,276 --> 00:28:15,821
I guess I just gave
up awhile back.

380
00:28:17,239 --> 00:28:18,740
I mean...

381
00:28:21,618 --> 00:28:24,121
I am what I am.

382
00:28:27,541 --> 00:28:28,792
But you...

383
00:28:31,003 --> 00:28:33,505
you've got a good
reason to hate me.

384
00:28:41,430 --> 00:28:43,056
I'm sorry.

385
00:28:44,766 --> 00:28:46,852
I'm sorry for what I did.

386
00:28:56,695 --> 00:28:58,989
You were trying to
protect your people.

387
00:29:02,451 --> 00:29:05,662
It wasn't you that killed Shannon.
It was them.

388
00:29:09,291 --> 00:29:12,085
And once we find out
he is one of them...

389
00:29:13,795 --> 00:29:17,508
then  something will
have to be done.

390
00:29:30,812 --> 00:29:31,730
What?

391
00:29:32,523 --> 00:29:33,607
Nothing.

392
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:38,278
It's gonna rain.

393
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:40,239
We should get moving.

394
00:29:40,531 --> 00:29:42,866
Morning! Who wants breakfast?

395
00:29:42,991 --> 00:29:45,285
I have papayas and papayas.

396
00:29:45,452 --> 00:29:46,119
Let's go.

397
00:29:47,454 --> 00:29:50,207
Right. Why eat?

398
00:30:02,344 --> 00:30:03,679
This is it.

399
00:30:10,352 --> 00:30:13,981
His balloon would be
rather large, right?

400
00:30:14,106 --> 00:30:16,066
Why am I not surprised?

401
00:30:18,026 --> 00:30:19,736
We need to look some more.

402
00:30:19,987 --> 00:30:21,864
This is where he
said it would be.

403
00:30:22,072 --> 00:30:26,952
If I'm gonna back your play on this,
Sayid, we need to be sure.

404
00:30:30,664 --> 00:30:33,417
I'll divide the area
into three grids.

405
00:30:35,544 --> 00:30:38,297
We'll search as
thoroughly as you please.

406
00:30:53,645 --> 00:30:55,981
Oh, for the love of god!

407
00:31:04,531 --> 00:31:07,159
Oh, no, no, no, no.
It's not for fish.

408
00:31:07,743 --> 00:31:10,037
No, no, no. Oysters.

409
00:31:11,747 --> 00:31:16,919
Oyster. Pearl. For rose.

410
00:31:17,044 --> 00:31:18,420
- Ah!
- Pearl.

411
00:31:21,882 --> 00:31:23,467
No oyster.

412
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:25,594
No oyster here.

413
00:31:25,761 --> 00:31:27,471
Ah. Of course not.

414
00:31:28,305 --> 00:31:30,098
Why would there be?

415
00:31:30,224 --> 00:31:31,683
Yo, daddy-o!

416
00:31:33,227 --> 00:31:33,977
Sawyer.

417
00:31:34,061 --> 00:31:37,397
Way to go, papa-san.
You didn't waste much time.

418
00:31:38,398 --> 00:31:40,817
I'd give you a cigar,
Bernie, but I'm fresh out.

419
00:31:40,901 --> 00:31:42,361
Sun's pregnant?

420
00:31:42,486 --> 00:31:46,990
Keep it down there, Suzy.
I don't think Jin Sr. here knows yet.

421
00:32:14,017 --> 00:32:15,519


422
00:32:18,230 --> 00:32:20,274


423
00:32:24,945 --> 00:32:26,530


424
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:29,283


425
00:32:37,124 --> 00:32:38,876


426
00:32:40,210 --> 00:32:40,836


427
00:32:41,044 --> 00:32:42,963


428
00:32:43,547 --> 00:32:44,756


429
00:32:46,967 --> 00:32:48,719


430
00:32:53,390 --> 00:32:56,018


431
00:32:59,062 --> 00:33:01,106


432
00:33:03,567 --> 00:33:05,652


433
00:33:07,112 --> 00:33:08,739


434
00:33:08,864 --> 00:33:10,282


435
00:33:10,490 --> 00:33:11,783


436
00:33:13,869 --> 00:33:14,745


437
00:33:14,912 --> 00:33:16,955


438
00:33:20,042 --> 00:33:21,126


439
00:33:22,169 --> 00:33:23,462


440
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:26,840


441
00:33:34,556 --> 00:33:35,974


442
00:33:37,392 --> 00:33:38,560


443
00:33:38,936 --> 00:33:40,354


444
00:33:42,147 --> 00:33:44,650


445
00:33:59,373 --> 00:34:00,666


446
00:34:03,252 --> 00:34:04,211


447
00:34:06,088 --> 00:34:08,173


448
00:34:09,091 --> 00:34:10,717


449
00:34:11,134 --> 00:34:13,595


450
00:34:13,846 --> 00:34:15,764


451
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:21,270


452
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:23,438


453
00:34:27,484 --> 00:34:29,945


454
00:34:30,988 --> 00:34:35,367


455
00:34:36,201 --> 00:34:36,785


456
00:34:37,786 --> 00:34:40,205


457
00:34:41,373 --> 00:34:42,708


458
00:34:42,833 --> 00:34:44,459


459
00:34:44,626 --> 00:34:45,794


460
00:34:45,919 --> 00:34:47,296


461
00:34:48,255 --> 00:34:51,175


462
00:34:54,344 --> 00:34:58,348


463
00:34:58,515 --> 00:35:01,393


464
00:35:04,271 --> 00:35:07,608


465
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:11,528


466
00:35:26,335 --> 00:35:28,378


467
00:35:35,636 --> 00:35:37,596


468
00:35:40,098 --> 00:35:41,600


469
00:35:44,895 --> 00:35:46,688


470
00:35:48,982 --> 00:35:51,026


471
00:35:55,948 --> 00:35:58,450


472
00:36:00,536 --> 00:36:02,746


473
00:36:05,749 --> 00:36:07,626


474
00:36:22,307 --> 00:36:25,352


475
00:36:58,135 --> 00:36:59,553


476
00:37:00,470 --> 00:37:03,223


477
00:37:07,811 --> 00:37:10,189


478
00:37:16,236 --> 00:37:18,405


479
00:37:19,907 --> 00:37:22,701


480
00:37:23,285 --> 00:37:26,330


481
00:37:28,415 --> 00:37:29,750
"daddy-O."

482
00:37:31,835 --> 00:37:33,754


483
00:37:34,004 --> 00:37:36,340


484
00:37:39,635 --> 00:37:41,053


485
00:37:42,179 --> 00:37:43,347


486
00:37:45,349 --> 00:37:49,853


487
00:37:51,021 --> 00:37:52,397


488
00:37:56,026 --> 00:37:57,528


489
00:38:03,534 --> 00:38:05,410


490
00:38:07,996 --> 00:38:09,248


491
00:38:10,207 --> 00:38:10,999


492
00:38:27,766 --> 00:38:31,979
I... love... you.

493
00:39:16,815 --> 00:39:18,358
How is it?

494
00:39:19,902 --> 00:39:22,696
"Men reject their
prophets and slay them.

495
00:39:23,030 --> 00:39:27,159
"But they love their martyrs and
honor thosewhom they have slain."

496
00:39:27,534 --> 00:39:31,455
So what's the difference
between a martyr and a prophet?

497
00:39:31,747 --> 00:39:34,666
Either way,
sounds like you end up dead.

498
00:39:36,043 --> 00:39:37,753
That's the spirit.

499
00:39:42,132 --> 00:39:44,176
You in the mood
for some breakfast?

500
00:39:59,983 --> 00:40:01,944
What's the computer for?

501
00:40:02,194 --> 00:40:03,195
Nothing.

502
00:40:09,326 --> 00:40:10,953
Cereal?

503
00:40:11,203 --> 00:40:13,330
Wow, where did you
guys get cereal?

504
00:40:13,664 --> 00:40:17,376
It was down here all along.
The pantry's full of food.

505
00:40:20,128 --> 00:40:21,839
How old is it?

506
00:40:26,134 --> 00:40:28,887
You guys don't know much, huh?

507
00:40:29,054 --> 00:40:32,854
I mean, I'd be asking all kinds of
questions about all this stuff
down here.

508
00:40:33,225 --> 00:40:35,310
You guys don't even
seem that curious.

509
00:40:35,519 --> 00:40:37,646
Do you want the
cereal or don't you?

510
00:40:41,108 --> 00:40:43,527
This must be my reward
for good behavior, huh?

511
00:40:43,610 --> 00:40:47,447
I guess I earned myself some goodwill
for finally drawing that map for Ana.

512
00:40:49,616 --> 00:40:51,076
What map?

513
00:40:52,119 --> 00:40:53,829
To my balloon.

514
00:40:55,122 --> 00:40:56,582
- Did you--
- No.

515
00:41:00,043 --> 00:41:03,589
Wow. You guys have some real
trust issues, don't you?

516
00:41:05,674 --> 00:41:08,093
Guess it makes sense
she didn't tell you.

517
00:41:08,635 --> 00:41:11,263
I mean, with the two of you
fighting all the time...

518
00:41:15,267 --> 00:41:20,564
'course if I was one of them-- these
people that you seem to think are
your enemies--

519
00:41:20,772 --> 00:41:23,567
what would I do?

520
00:41:27,404 --> 00:41:29,865
Hmm. There'd be no balloon.

521
00:41:30,908 --> 00:41:34,661
So I'd draw a map to
a real secluded place

522
00:41:35,037 --> 00:41:38,332
like a cave or
some underbrush...

523
00:41:38,582 --> 00:41:40,918
good place for a trap.

524
00:41:43,212 --> 00:41:45,047
An ambush.

525
00:41:47,257 --> 00:41:51,261
And when your friends got there, a bunch
of my people would be waiting for 'em.

526
00:41:54,306 --> 00:41:57,309
And then they'd use
them to trade for me.

527
00:41:58,977 --> 00:42:02,064
I guess it's a good thing
I'm not one of them, huh?

528
00:42:08,654 --> 00:42:09,821
You guys got any milk?

529
00:42:09,904 --> 00:42:11,999
