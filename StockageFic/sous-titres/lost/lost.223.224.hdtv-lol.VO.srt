1
00:00:02,127 --> 00:00:03,974
Do you ever think that
maybe they put you down here

2
00:00:04,004 --> 00:00:06,768
to push your button every 108
minutes just to see if you would?

3
00:00:06,798 --> 00:00:09,897
That all of this, the computer,
the button, is just a mind game.

4
00:00:09,927 --> 00:00:12,221
Every single day.

5
00:00:12,304 --> 00:00:14,254
What do you find it
so hard to believe?

6
00:00:14,348 --> 00:00:17,267
- What do you find it so easy?
- It's never been easy.

7
00:00:17,351 --> 00:00:19,895
Your tour of duty in the
Pearl will last 3 weeks.

8
00:00:19,978 --> 00:00:21,897
You and your partner
will observe a

9
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:24,274
psychological experiment
in progress.

10
00:00:24,355 --> 00:00:26,871
These team members are not aware
that they're under surveillance

11
00:00:26,901 --> 00:00:29,166
or that they are the
subjects of an experiment.

12
00:00:29,198 --> 00:00:31,610
Every single second

13
00:00:31,786 --> 00:00:36,539
of my pathetic little life is
as useless as that button!

14
00:00:36,665 --> 00:00:40,042
If you will not continue
to push the button, John,

15
00:00:41,797 --> 00:00:42,911
I will.

16
00:00:43,047 --> 00:00:45,373
One of our people was
captured by yours.

17
00:00:45,517 --> 00:00:46,713
So? Go get him back.

18
00:00:46,835 --> 00:00:49,590
We can't do that but you can.

19
00:00:49,675 --> 00:00:52,672
And if you do,
we'll let you and Walt go free.

20
00:00:53,427 --> 00:00:54,383
Walt?

21
00:00:55,268 --> 00:00:57,471
Dad, don't leave me.
Don't leave me!

22
00:00:57,555 --> 00:00:58,943
I'm gonna get you
out of here, okay?

23
00:00:58,978 --> 00:01:01,031
I promise you,
I will get you out of here!

24
00:01:01,067 --> 00:01:04,392
- Dad! Dad! I love you!
- I love you, too, Walt!

25
00:01:04,647 --> 00:01:07,690
I'm writing four names down.
Four of your friends.

26
00:01:07,776 --> 00:01:11,022
But if you don't bring all
the people on the list,

27
00:01:11,196 --> 00:01:12,941
you'll never see Walt again.

28
00:01:17,617 --> 00:01:18,491
Michael?

29
00:01:21,956 --> 00:01:24,291
- Did you see Walt?
- No.

30
00:01:24,916 --> 00:01:26,792
I have to get my son back.

31
00:01:26,925 --> 00:01:28,821
We're gonna help you
do that, Michael.

32
00:01:28,887 --> 00:01:30,601
But it's gotta be
the way I said, man.

33
00:01:30,636 --> 00:01:33,712
You, me, Kate, Sawyer, Hurley--
that's it.

34
00:01:33,886 --> 00:01:35,232
Then that's the way it'll be.

35
00:01:35,267 --> 00:01:38,193
- I think Michael has been compromised.
- Why would he lie to us?

36
00:01:38,225 --> 00:01:40,571
Because I believe he's
leading you into a trap.

37
00:01:41,936 --> 00:01:43,532
All right,
let's go talk to him.

38
00:01:43,686 --> 00:01:46,483
No, he must continue to
believe he's in control.

39
00:01:52,525 --> 00:01:53,403
Boat.

40
00:02:04,047 --> 00:02:06,003
Are we rescue? Are we saved?

41
00:02:38,157 --> 00:02:39,612
You see anything?

42
00:02:39,918 --> 00:02:40,532
No.

43
00:02:44,588 --> 00:02:47,582
- Maybe it's a trap.
- What do you mean, a trap?

44
00:03:23,918 --> 00:03:24,740
You hear that?

45
00:03:40,676 --> 00:03:42,013
Oh, damn it!

46
00:03:55,947 --> 00:03:56,773
You.

47
00:04:23,346 --> 00:04:27,681
Okay, okay, just wait one second, okay?
I'll be right back.

48
00:04:32,775 --> 00:04:35,160
Everybody needs to know what's going on,
Jack. There's a boat--

49
00:04:35,195 --> 00:04:39,820
Just tell 'em Desmond's back
until I find out the rest, okay?

50
00:04:56,506 --> 00:05:00,252
So, before you ran off,
I guess you just

51
00:05:00,847 --> 00:05:03,513
forgot to mention that
you still have a sailboat.

52
00:05:05,135 --> 00:05:07,300
Why'd you come back?

53
00:05:10,316 --> 00:05:12,520
Do you think I
did it on purpose?

54
00:05:16,445 --> 00:05:20,940
I was sailing for two and a half weeks,
bearing due west

55
00:05:21,195 --> 00:05:24,862
and making 9 knots. I should have
been in Fiji in less than a week.

56
00:05:25,367 --> 00:05:28,702
But the first piece of land I
saw wasn't fiji, was it? No.

57
00:05:29,076 --> 00:05:32,951
No, it was here, this...
this island.

58
00:05:34,585 --> 00:05:36,460
And you know why?

59
00:05:37,336 --> 00:05:39,251
Because this is it.

60
00:05:39,677 --> 00:05:44,010
This is all there is left--
this ocean and this place here.

61
00:05:44,097 --> 00:05:46,933
We are stuck in a
bloody snow globe!

62
00:05:49,346 --> 00:05:51,891
There's no outside world.
There's no escape!

63
00:05:54,186 --> 00:05:58,232
So just... just go, yeah?
Let me drink.

64
00:06:07,245 --> 00:06:08,821
Are you still pushing it?

65
00:06:12,417 --> 00:06:14,242
Yeah, we're still pushing it.

66
00:06:24,515 --> 00:06:25,761
Set of keys.

67
00:06:26,427 --> 00:06:28,970
One pocket watch, gold-plated.

68
00:06:30,145 --> 00:06:31,393
One photograph.

69
00:06:40,237 --> 00:06:42,482
One book-- "our mutual friend."

70
00:06:45,658 --> 00:06:48,200
Why didn't you
bring that inside?

71
00:06:48,706 --> 00:06:50,612
To avoid temptation, brother.

72
00:06:50,956 --> 00:06:54,082
I've read everything mr.
Charles dickens has ever written--

73
00:06:54,338 --> 00:06:56,832
every wonderful word,
every book.

74
00:06:57,046 --> 00:06:58,663
Except this one.

75
00:06:59,466 --> 00:07:00,960
I'm saving it.

76
00:07:01,387 --> 00:07:05,212
So it'll be the last thing
I ever read before I die.

77
00:07:05,387 --> 00:07:08,840
Nice idea,
long as you know when you're gonna die.

78
00:07:11,437 --> 00:07:14,183
Lance corporal
Desmond David Hume,

79
00:07:14,308 --> 00:07:16,220
your sentence is
hereby complete,

80
00:07:16,358 --> 00:07:19,311
and you are now and forever
dishonorably discharged

81
00:07:19,435 --> 00:07:22,983
from the royal scots regiment
of her Majesty's armed forces.

82
00:07:23,065 --> 00:07:24,153
Long live the queen.

83
00:07:25,156 --> 00:07:26,983
Enjoy your sodding book.

84
00:07:41,005 --> 00:07:42,332
You want a ride?

85
00:07:47,096 --> 00:07:48,383
Not with you.

86
00:07:49,347 --> 00:07:50,593
Get in the car.

87
00:08:05,237 --> 00:08:09,481
- Did you bring me a present?
- Actually, two presents.

88
00:08:09,998 --> 00:08:13,032
One of these boxescontains
your past, Hume--

89
00:08:13,415 --> 00:08:15,622
the other, your future.

90
00:08:16,076 --> 00:08:17,582
Go ahead. Open it.

91
00:08:31,427 --> 00:08:33,022
You're a bastard,
you know that?

92
00:08:33,307 --> 00:08:35,342
The fact that she
never received your...

93
00:08:36,395 --> 00:08:41,521
sentiments is good for her--
good because as far as she's concerned,

94
00:08:41,686 --> 00:08:45,270
you've  forsaken her,
and that's the way it's going to stay.

95
00:08:45,406 --> 00:08:46,151
Is it now?

96
00:08:47,238 --> 00:08:51,152
Penelope has moved on, Hume.
She's getting married.

97
00:08:59,375 --> 00:09:04,711
This is for your new life...
away from my daughter.

98
00:09:06,927 --> 00:09:08,920
The conditions are simple.

99
00:09:09,965 --> 00:09:13,470
No contact. No calls, no posts.

100
00:09:14,016 --> 00:09:18,142
You just... run away, Desmond.

101
00:09:19,975 --> 00:09:24,433
And what makes you think
I would just run away?

102
00:09:27,867 --> 00:09:29,772
Because you're a coward.

103
00:09:38,456 --> 00:09:40,162
On the way to the funeral,

104
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:43,050
I told you that Michael had
been compromised by the others,

105
00:09:43,087 --> 00:09:45,982
and then you asked me how we
might take advantage of that.

106
00:09:46,047 --> 00:09:50,460
I believe fate has given us our answer--
the boat.

107
00:09:50,797 --> 00:09:52,550
The boat?

108
00:09:53,098 --> 00:09:55,922
This camp Michael is leading you to,
across the island--

109
00:09:56,186 --> 00:09:58,143
That is where they
will set their trap.

110
00:09:58,555 --> 00:10:00,220
While Michael
leads you by land,

111
00:10:00,396 --> 00:10:02,433
I can approach far
more quickly by sea,

112
00:10:02,936 --> 00:10:05,351
and I can go ashore undetected.

113
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:07,732
Go ashore and do what?

114
00:10:07,856 --> 00:10:11,693
Scout them-- their numbers
and positions, their weapons.

115
00:10:11,986 --> 00:10:15,782
Then I'll go to the nearest beach
and start a signal fire with these.

116
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:18,203
They  burn with a dark,
black smoke.

117
00:10:18,827 --> 00:10:21,572
You and your team will come
to meet me at the signal...

118
00:10:22,585 --> 00:10:24,451
and we will go in together.

119
00:10:26,166 --> 00:10:28,813
We're not even sure if
Michael's been turned by them.

120
00:10:28,875 --> 00:10:30,581
He  has been turned.

121
00:10:34,177 --> 00:10:36,812
I'll have to tell Kate and Hurley
and Sawyer what we're doing--

122
00:10:36,845 --> 00:10:40,263
No. Michael cannot sense
we know he is lying.

123
00:10:41,188 --> 00:10:43,682
All we have is the
element of surprise, Jack.

124
00:10:44,855 --> 00:10:47,753
Right now it's only your
responsibility to keep it secret.

125
00:10:52,236 --> 00:10:53,903
Black smoke, huh?

126
00:10:55,038 --> 00:10:58,861
This time...
they will know that we are coming.

127
00:11:10,295 --> 00:11:11,541
Hello, John.

128
00:11:13,348 --> 00:11:14,710
Where have you been?

129
00:11:17,217 --> 00:11:18,670
I've been thinking.

130
00:11:20,266 --> 00:11:21,302
About what?

131
00:11:23,107 --> 00:11:27,060
That in a minute,
that computer's gonna start beeping,

132
00:11:27,728 --> 00:11:30,350
and when it does,
you're gonna let it go.

133
00:11:31,147 --> 00:11:34,733
You're gonna let it run down to zero--
past zero--

134
00:11:34,905 --> 00:11:37,360
and you're not gonna
push the button.

135
00:11:37,575 --> 00:11:41,150
But I am going to push the button.
Why wouldn't I?

136
00:11:41,328 --> 00:11:43,283
Because you don't
wanna be a slave.

137
00:11:45,628 --> 00:11:47,330
I am a slave to nothing.

138
00:11:47,547 --> 00:11:51,620
You're a slave to that,
just like I was.

139
00:11:52,427 --> 00:11:54,420
So I'm going to tell you again.

140
00:11:55,928 --> 00:11:58,302
Don't push it.

141
00:12:00,017 --> 00:12:02,380
Do not tell me what I can't do.

142
00:12:11,146 --> 00:12:13,520
You cannot push that button.

143
00:12:22,075 --> 00:12:23,861
No, it's not real!

144
00:12:23,951 --> 00:12:25,746
We're only puppets--

145
00:12:25,878 --> 00:12:27,370
puppets on strings!

146
00:12:27,746 --> 00:12:30,209
Aah! As long as we push it,
we'll never be free.

147
00:12:31,258 --> 00:12:32,922
Well, you're free now, John.

148
00:12:33,375 --> 00:12:34,672
Do not come back.

149
00:12:35,338 --> 00:12:35,883
No.

150
00:12:54,105 --> 00:12:56,690
No way.
If I take that, I'm gonna kill someone.

151
00:12:56,777 --> 00:12:58,440
Ain't that the point?

152
00:12:58,778 --> 00:13:00,820
I thought the point
was to get Walt back.

153
00:13:05,076 --> 00:13:06,240
What's the matter?

154
00:13:08,878 --> 00:13:11,542
All that stuff we found
in the medical station--

155
00:13:11,795 --> 00:13:14,411
costumes, makeup, fake beards?

156
00:13:15,547 --> 00:13:18,102
What if these people just want
us to think they're hillbillies?

157
00:13:18,137 --> 00:13:20,213
Listen, listen, I was there.

158
00:13:20,385 --> 00:13:22,550
I saw them.
They are hillbillies.

159
00:13:22,767 --> 00:13:24,412
They live in huts.
They eat fish.

160
00:13:24,476 --> 00:13:26,441
They're probably more
scared than we are,

161
00:13:26,476 --> 00:13:28,800
and they have no idea
we're on our way.

162
00:13:31,397 --> 00:13:34,101
All right.
Enough jibber-jabber.

163
00:13:34,355 --> 00:13:35,811
Let's roll.

164
00:14:01,637 --> 00:14:03,090
I need your boat.

165
00:14:05,638 --> 00:14:08,593
I wouldn't waste your time.
There's nothing out there, pal.

166
00:14:09,095 --> 00:14:10,600
I'm not going out there.

167
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:13,532
I need to get to the north shore
of the island, and quickly.

168
00:14:13,565 --> 00:14:15,600
Off to see the hostiles,
are you?

169
00:14:15,687 --> 00:14:16,393
The what?

170
00:14:17,316 --> 00:14:19,691
You know what?

171
00:14:19,735 --> 00:14:21,730
Ignorance is bliss.

172
00:14:23,406 --> 00:14:25,282
The boat's all yours, brother.

173
00:14:26,658 --> 00:14:28,612
For all the good it'll do ya.

174
00:14:31,285 --> 00:14:33,242
I don't know how to sail.

175
00:14:34,247 --> 00:14:36,461
Then I suggest you
find someone who does.

176
00:14:45,055 --> 00:14:49,133
Just give me whichever one has
the most caffeine in it, brother.

177
00:14:51,437 --> 00:14:54,563
Oh, damn. Um...

178
00:14:54,776 --> 00:14:57,562
I'm sorry.
I've just arrived, and, uh,

179
00:14:57,815 --> 00:14:59,943
I spent all my american
money on a taxi.

180
00:15:00,317 --> 00:15:01,861
I've got it.

181
00:15:03,626 --> 00:15:06,780
- Uh, that's not necessary.
- It's just 4 bucks.

182
00:15:08,535 --> 00:15:11,411
I n't suppose you have
42,000 more of those, do ya?

183
00:15:11,625 --> 00:15:12,951
Depends on what it's for.

184
00:15:13,208 --> 00:15:16,500
- I was joking.
- No, you weren't.

185
00:15:17,966 --> 00:15:20,501
A solo sailing race
around the world?

186
00:15:20,675 --> 00:15:23,752
I have eight months to get into
the best shape of my life.

187
00:15:24,177 --> 00:15:26,762
But I'll tell you what, miss.

188
00:15:26,928 --> 00:15:28,261
I'm going to win.

189
00:15:28,345 --> 00:15:30,050
And what do you get if you do?

190
00:15:30,225 --> 00:15:31,763
What really matters...

191
00:15:33,438 --> 00:15:34,811
is who I win it from.

192
00:15:39,607 --> 00:15:41,060
"Charles Widmore."

193
00:15:41,487 --> 00:15:42,981
He tried to buy me off,

194
00:15:44,487 --> 00:15:46,481
and when I didn't
take his money,

195
00:15:47,076 --> 00:15:50,202
he took away the only
thing in the world that...

196
00:15:51,365 --> 00:15:53,322
I ever truly cared about.

197
00:15:54,205 --> 00:15:55,620
Who is she?

198
00:15:57,588 --> 00:15:58,953
His daughter.

199
00:16:00,667 --> 00:16:04,251
I was unsuitable
on several levels.

200
00:16:05,218 --> 00:16:09,591
- And what's the 42 grand for?
- It's a wee bit complicated.

201
00:16:09,885 --> 00:16:12,971
As of yet,
I don't actually have a boat.

202
00:16:18,317 --> 00:16:20,770
Sorry, did I say
something wrong?

203
00:16:23,158 --> 00:16:25,612
I have a boat.

204
00:16:28,485 --> 00:16:30,111
It was my husband's, but...

205
00:16:32,035 --> 00:16:33,863
he got sick and...

206
00:16:35,826 --> 00:16:40,001
he wanted to sail to the Mediterranean,
but he never...

207
00:16:46,756 --> 00:16:48,131
he passed away...

208
00:16:49,886 --> 00:16:51,383
about a month ago.

209
00:16:55,057 --> 00:16:56,260
I'm sorry.

210
00:17:03,646 --> 00:17:04,812
I want you to have it.

211
00:17:07,905 --> 00:17:11,823
I... I can't take
your boat, miss.

212
00:17:11,945 --> 00:17:13,653
But you have to.

213
00:17:15,415 --> 00:17:16,913
He'd want you to.

214
00:17:28,505 --> 00:17:30,341
What was your husband's name?

215
00:17:34,178 --> 00:17:35,300
David.

216
00:17:36,765 --> 00:17:38,513
And what did he name his boat?

217
00:17:41,525 --> 00:17:42,683
"Elizabeth."

218
00:17:45,895 --> 00:17:47,483
He named it after me.

219
00:17:50,907 --> 00:17:52,033
Then...

220
00:17:52,655 --> 00:17:55,860
I thank you, Elizabeth.

221
00:17:58,418 --> 00:18:01,200
And I shall win this race...

222
00:18:02,085 --> 00:18:03,373
for love.

223
00:18:19,687 --> 00:18:21,762
Would you excuse us, please?

224
00:18:24,315 --> 00:18:25,643
I'll be at the shore.

225
00:18:29,946 --> 00:18:34,483


226
00:18:35,195 --> 00:18:36,781


227
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:40,871


228
00:18:41,666 --> 00:18:44,240


229
00:18:45,338 --> 00:18:47,750


230
00:18:49,836 --> 00:18:51,842


231
00:19:22,627 --> 00:19:24,493
Don't  even think about it.

232
00:19:24,837 --> 00:19:25,741
It's a trap.

233
00:19:26,705 --> 00:19:29,213
A net.
Rousseau's got 'em all over the island.

234
00:19:30,087 --> 00:19:31,751
How the hell would
you know that?

235
00:19:32,466 --> 00:19:35,882
Kind of tripped one with Jack.

236
00:19:36,265 --> 00:19:37,710
We ended up...

237
00:19:38,725 --> 00:19:40,181
never mind.

238
00:19:43,016 --> 00:19:43,933
What?

239
00:19:44,647 --> 00:19:48,603
When the doc told me y'all got caught in
a net, I thought he meant that, uh...

240
00:19:50,237 --> 00:19:51,601
somethin' else.

241
00:19:52,905 --> 00:19:55,902
And since when did you and
Jack start talking about me?

242
00:20:18,557 --> 00:20:21,053
Did that bird just say my name?

243
00:20:22,308 --> 00:20:24,183
Yeah, it did...

244
00:20:24,728 --> 00:20:27,352
right before it crapped gold.

245
00:20:39,156 --> 00:20:41,861
Sorry, man.
Guess I forgot to load that one.

246
00:20:41,995 --> 00:20:43,661
Wanna hand me the mag?

247
00:21:04,647 --> 00:21:05,391
John?

248
00:21:14,147 --> 00:21:15,491
What happened to your face?

249
00:21:17,618 --> 00:21:18,861
Nothing. I'm fine.

250
00:21:19,577 --> 00:21:20,610
Hey, uh...

251
00:21:22,827 --> 00:21:25,132
if you're feeling a little
sorry for yourself, you...

252
00:21:25,168 --> 00:21:28,582
you may wanna have a drink
with your mate from the hatch.

253
00:21:28,745 --> 00:21:31,583
I hear he's a little
despondent as well.

254
00:21:32,875 --> 00:21:33,542
What?

255
00:21:33,717 --> 00:21:35,722
Oh, that's right.
You weren't there for the

256
00:21:35,758 --> 00:21:38,170
dramatic arrival
at the funeral.

257
00:21:38,347 --> 00:21:41,842
I think he's pushed your button
too many times, if you ask me.

258
00:21:43,726 --> 00:21:46,970
- Desmond?
- Yeah. Desmond.

259
00:21:47,807 --> 00:21:50,511
I'm sure you two have
a lot to talk about.

260
00:22:05,957 --> 00:22:08,491
I'm sorry if what I said
was confusing, but...

261
00:22:09,418 --> 00:22:11,080
I asked Jin to come.

262
00:22:13,508 --> 00:22:15,582
You need someone to translate,

263
00:22:15,715 --> 00:22:18,581
and you need at least two
people who know how to sail.

264
00:22:18,795 --> 00:22:20,753
Desmond managed by himself.

265
00:22:21,217 --> 00:22:23,513
And look where he ended up.

266
00:22:38,858 --> 00:22:40,521
You're wasting
your time, sister.

267
00:22:41,027 --> 00:22:45,940
I shot myself with that stuff
every 9 days for 3 years.

268
00:22:51,245 --> 00:22:52,373
He's lovely.

269
00:22:55,126 --> 00:22:58,752
Is the...
is the father here on the island?

270
00:22:58,847 --> 00:23:02,340
No. Nope,
he's been gone a long time.

271
00:23:02,717 --> 00:23:07,131
Just sort of walked off the moment he
got a bit scared by the situation.

272
00:23:08,558 --> 00:23:12,470
Well, maybe he knew
he'd be a lousy dad.

273
00:23:14,187 --> 00:23:16,563
Thought he was doing
what was best for you.

274
00:23:17,028 --> 00:23:19,903
He was doing what
was best for him.

275
00:24:07,286 --> 00:24:08,570
How did you find me?

276
00:24:08,995 --> 00:24:11,631
Landlord at your flat told
me you ran here every day--

277
00:24:11,667 --> 00:24:13,123
How did you find me?

278
00:24:13,165 --> 00:24:14,873
I have a lot of money, Desmond.

279
00:24:16,798 --> 00:24:19,642
With enough money and determination,
you can find anyone.

280
00:24:25,098 --> 00:24:29,843
Did  you read your beloved book--
the one you were saving?

281
00:24:31,387 --> 00:24:32,683
Not yet.

282
00:24:35,227 --> 00:24:38,223
I thought you might have
read it while you were away.

283
00:24:38,315 --> 00:24:40,021
I was in prison.

284
00:24:40,647 --> 00:24:42,443
Not away.

285
00:24:44,028 --> 00:24:46,273
Why didn't you write to me?

286
00:24:58,457 --> 00:25:01,001
When are you getting
married, Pen?

287
00:25:05,586 --> 00:25:09,593
- We haven't set a date yet.
- I'll be back in a year.

288
00:25:09,716 --> 00:25:12,050
What if you were
back right now?

289
00:25:12,177 --> 00:25:14,301
I'm gonna win this race, Pen...

290
00:25:15,846 --> 00:25:17,103
his race.

291
00:25:17,767 --> 00:25:19,473
And in a year,

292
00:25:20,357 --> 00:25:21,891
I'll be back.

293
00:25:39,168 --> 00:25:41,701
Desmond, what are
you running from?

294
00:25:46,335 --> 00:25:49,172
I have to get my honor back.

295
00:25:51,718 --> 00:25:54,092
And that is what
I'm running to.

296
00:26:10,235 --> 00:26:14,613
So what did one snowman
say to the other snowman?

297
00:26:15,656 --> 00:26:17,912
"Smells like carrots."

298
00:26:18,747 --> 00:26:20,242
Hello, Desmond.

299
00:26:20,496 --> 00:26:22,203
Hello yourself, box man.

300
00:26:26,295 --> 00:26:28,543
- Do you mind?
- Oh, I insist.

301
00:26:31,967 --> 00:26:34,921
So you managed to fix the computer then,
did you?

302
00:26:36,267 --> 00:26:38,180
The world's still here,
ain't it?

303
00:26:38,977 --> 00:26:41,391
I'm not so sure
about that, brother.

304
00:26:41,475 --> 00:26:44,221
Refresh my memory, Desmond.
How long did you say

305
00:26:44,565 --> 00:26:47,691
that you were down
there in the hatch?

306
00:26:48,195 --> 00:26:49,271
Three years.

307
00:26:51,156 --> 00:26:53,361
Desmond, what if
I told you that...

308
00:26:54,406 --> 00:26:57,452
for all that,
all those years that you and

309
00:26:57,576 --> 00:27:01,490
all the men before you were down there,
pushing that button...

310
00:27:03,746 --> 00:27:06,372
What if I told you it
was all for nothing?

311
00:27:07,627 --> 00:27:12,171
I'd ask you how the hell did
you know something like that?

312
00:27:13,465 --> 00:27:15,550
I found another hatch.

313
00:27:16,675 --> 00:27:19,221
Another station on the island.

314
00:27:20,265 --> 00:27:22,512
They called it the Pearl.

315
00:27:22,687 --> 00:27:27,232
And I saw a film there--
an orientation film--

316
00:27:27,357 --> 00:27:31,101
and it said that everything that
was happening in our hatch...

317
00:27:32,116 --> 00:27:33,822
wasn't real.

318
00:27:34,446 --> 00:27:36,363
That it was a test.

319
00:27:38,958 --> 00:27:41,660
A psychological experiment.

320
00:27:42,706 --> 00:27:44,161
You're lying.

321
00:27:57,097 --> 00:27:58,720
You wanna take a walk?

322
00:27:58,926 --> 00:28:00,552
I'll make the popcorn.

323
00:28:00,765 --> 00:28:03,142
If you're so sure
it's not real,

324
00:28:03,687 --> 00:28:06,681
then just stop
pushing the button!

325
00:28:06,936 --> 00:28:10,020
Well, I have,
except, unfortunately,

326
00:28:10,198 --> 00:28:12,732
someone else decided to start.

327
00:28:13,366 --> 00:28:16,072
So you're gonna sober up.

328
00:28:17,615 --> 00:28:20,742
And we're gonna get a good
night's sleep, and tomorrow

329
00:28:20,825 --> 00:28:25,533
we're gonna find out what happens
if that button doesn't get pushed.

330
00:28:41,057 --> 00:28:42,551
Dharma nutrabar?

331
00:28:42,768 --> 00:28:44,803
No, thanks. Not hungry.

332
00:28:44,977 --> 00:28:46,143
Are you serious?

333
00:29:09,375 --> 00:29:10,120
Hey.

334
00:29:11,585 --> 00:29:12,503
You all right?

335
00:29:13,587 --> 00:29:16,711
Yeah, just, uh,
getting some more firewood.

336
00:29:16,847 --> 00:29:18,212
Not feeling too hot.

337
00:29:19,887 --> 00:29:22,972
You shouldn'tbe out here alone, huh?
I'll give you a hand.

338
00:29:28,265 --> 00:29:29,313
Hey.

339
00:29:30,277 --> 00:29:31,620
Thanks for coming out here,

340
00:29:31,775 --> 00:29:33,231
risking your neck for my boy.

341
00:29:35,486 --> 00:29:37,230
Live together, die alone, man.

342
00:29:38,407 --> 00:29:39,020
Yeah.

343
00:30:03,885 --> 00:30:05,802


344
00:30:08,435 --> 00:30:10,642


345
00:30:10,818 --> 00:30:11,773


346
00:30:14,435 --> 00:30:16,022


347
00:30:30,287 --> 00:30:32,583
I don't know what is
more disquieting--

348
00:30:32,708 --> 00:30:35,290
the fact the rest of
the statue is missing...

349
00:30:35,838 --> 00:30:38,003
or that it has four toes.

350
00:31:36,146 --> 00:31:42,861
Eight... seven...
six... five... four...

351
00:31:45,617 --> 00:31:46,610
...one.

352
00:31:57,296 --> 00:31:58,041
John!

353
00:31:58,218 --> 00:31:59,123
Neat trick.

354
00:31:59,338 --> 00:32:00,041
John!

355
00:32:02,885 --> 00:32:03,631
John!

356
00:32:03,886 --> 00:32:05,552
Can you hear me?! Open up!

357
00:32:05,715 --> 00:32:07,180
I hope you're sure
about this, brother.

358
00:32:07,218 --> 00:32:10,930
I'm more sure about this than
anything in my entire life.

359
00:32:11,847 --> 00:32:13,600
Don't do this! John!

360
00:32:14,728 --> 00:32:16,721
All right, then, box man.

361
00:32:18,527 --> 00:32:19,563
We wait.

362
00:33:52,825 --> 00:33:54,613
Are you him?

363
00:33:56,166 --> 00:33:56,912
What?

364
00:33:58,878 --> 00:34:01,910
What did one snowman
say to the other?

365
00:34:03,295 --> 00:34:04,643
What are you talking about?

366
00:34:14,937 --> 00:34:16,132
Who are you?

367
00:34:17,727 --> 00:34:19,472
I'm Inman.

368
00:34:20,685 --> 00:34:22,350
Kelvin Inman.

369
00:34:27,738 --> 00:34:28,482
W hat...

370
00:34:30,195 --> 00:34:32,282
what happened to my boat?

371
00:34:34,158 --> 00:34:36,610
I found you washed
upon the beach.

372
00:34:38,538 --> 00:34:39,953
There was no boat.

373
00:35:19,495 --> 00:35:21,783
What was all that about, then?

374
00:35:25,548 --> 00:35:27,710
Just saving the world.

375
00:36:06,416 --> 00:36:08,912
How many times you
gonna watch that thing?

376
00:36:09,718 --> 00:36:11,753
Why are there missing parts?

377
00:36:12,088 --> 00:36:13,921
Radzinsky made some edits.

378
00:36:14,637 --> 00:36:18,473
- Who's Radzinsky?
- He was my partner.

379
00:36:19,555 --> 00:36:21,261
And what happened to him?

380
00:36:21,438 --> 00:36:25,682
Just make sure you put that back behind
"Turn of the screw" when you're done
with it.

381
00:36:26,145 --> 00:36:27,812
Why do you wear that suit?

382
00:36:28,738 --> 00:36:30,941
So I don't get
infected out there.

383
00:36:40,157 --> 00:36:42,910
Give yourself a shot of
this every nine days.

384
00:36:43,038 --> 00:36:45,622
You were out there a
while before I found you.

385
00:36:45,955 --> 00:36:47,912
Hope it's not too late.

386
00:36:53,175 --> 00:36:54,042
John!

387
00:36:54,506 --> 00:36:58,342
Who is he, box man--
the man out there pounding on the door?

388
00:36:58,518 --> 00:36:59,972
His name is Mr. Eko.

389
00:37:00,928 --> 00:37:04,223
And why does Mr. Eko carry around
a stick covered in scripture?

390
00:37:04,398 --> 00:37:06,263
Because he's a priest.

391
00:37:06,436 --> 00:37:08,310
Open the door, please!
Don't do this.

392
00:37:08,725 --> 00:37:12,693
John! Can you hear me? Open up!

393
00:37:12,735 --> 00:37:14,271
We locked out a priest?

394
00:37:14,487 --> 00:37:14,941
John!

395
00:37:58,528 --> 00:38:01,041
Charlie, do you know how they
got the hatch door open?

396
00:38:01,078 --> 00:38:03,041
No, but if you hum it,
I can probably play it.

397
00:38:03,078 --> 00:38:06,201
How did they open it--
the door that says "quarantine"?

398
00:38:06,376 --> 00:38:07,663
They blew it up. Why?

399
00:38:07,876 --> 00:38:09,621
Charlie, I need your help.

400
00:38:09,915 --> 00:38:12,580
Oh, now I'm back in your
good graces, father?

401
00:38:12,755 --> 00:38:15,503
Charlie, John has locked
me out of the hatch,

402
00:38:15,588 --> 00:38:18,972
and I believe he is doing this because
he's going to stop pushing that button,

403
00:38:19,008 --> 00:38:23,053
and, Charlie, I am absolutely
certain that if he is successful,

404
00:38:23,098 --> 00:38:26,262
in 90 minutes,
everyone on this island will die.

405
00:38:30,265 --> 00:38:33,233
- All right, I'm in. I'm in.
- Thank you. Come on, quick.

406
00:38:36,735 --> 00:38:40,521
So these others-- think they're
leftover from the Dharma folks?

407
00:38:40,616 --> 00:38:42,191
I don't know, man.

408
00:38:42,367 --> 00:38:44,782
My theory? They're aliens.

409
00:38:44,997 --> 00:38:48,951
That's why they use the fake beards--
Their heads are made of plastetic.

410
00:38:49,125 --> 00:38:50,453
Prosthetic, dude.

411
00:38:50,625 --> 00:38:53,091
You can't even spell,
and now you're correcting me?

412
00:38:53,128 --> 00:38:54,522
What do you think, freckles?

413
00:38:54,718 --> 00:38:56,832
Just keep moving.
We're being followed.

414
00:38:57,048 --> 00:38:58,880
- What?
- Just keep smiling.

415
00:39:02,845 --> 00:39:05,550
There's a least two of
them across the river.

416
00:39:06,596 --> 00:39:09,060
In about five seconds,
I'm gonna turn the tables on 'em.

417
00:39:09,096 --> 00:39:10,392
Whoa, wait a second.

418
00:39:10,807 --> 00:39:12,010
Are you in?

419
00:39:21,988 --> 00:39:22,572
Kate!

420
00:39:31,585 --> 00:39:32,782
He's getting away!

421
00:39:42,548 --> 00:39:44,803
He's dead.
We have to find the other one.

422
00:39:44,928 --> 00:39:45,420
No!

423
00:39:45,597 --> 00:39:47,420
- I'm going. Sawyer--
- I said no!

424
00:39:47,725 --> 00:39:50,312
You crazy?! We let him go, they'll
know we're coming! He'll warn them--

425
00:39:50,347 --> 00:39:53,101
It doesn't matter if
we catch him now.

426
00:39:57,646 --> 00:39:59,271
They've already been warned.

427
00:40:02,528 --> 00:40:04,402
What do you mean, "warned"?

428
00:40:08,458 --> 00:40:10,742
- Why don't you tell them, Michael?
- Jack...

429
00:40:10,825 --> 00:40:13,272
- I don't know what you're talking--
- Stop lying!

430
00:40:20,216 --> 00:40:21,040
Tell them.

431
00:40:21,466 --> 00:40:22,463
Tell them what?

432
00:40:23,425 --> 00:40:26,921
I know what you're doing, Michael!
Now tell them the truth.

433
00:40:28,226 --> 00:40:29,380
Tell them!

434
00:40:31,135 --> 00:40:32,763
It was the only way.

435
00:40:37,225 --> 00:40:38,851
They gave me a list.

436
00:40:40,027 --> 00:40:40,981
What list?

437
00:40:42,528 --> 00:40:44,770
It had your names on it.

438
00:40:48,118 --> 00:40:52,910
I had to bring all four of you back,
or they said I'd never see my son again!

439
00:40:54,668 --> 00:40:56,290
Who are they?

440
00:40:56,415 --> 00:41:00,753
It's like I said.
They live in a camp with huts, and...

441
00:41:01,298 --> 00:41:03,041
I swear that's it!

442
00:41:04,597 --> 00:41:06,550
You let Henry go?

443
00:41:13,725 --> 00:41:15,261
Did you kill them?

444
00:41:16,146 --> 00:41:17,853
Ana Lucia...

445
00:41:18,565 --> 00:41:19,893
and Libby?

446
00:41:24,026 --> 00:41:25,271
Did you?

447
00:41:27,446 --> 00:41:29,033
I had to.

448
00:41:29,655 --> 00:41:35,783
I... uh... I couldn't find any
other way, and Libby was a mistake.

449
00:41:35,955 --> 00:41:38,120
I didn't have time to think.

450
00:41:41,667 --> 00:41:44,210
But if you did have time...

451
00:41:49,517 --> 00:41:51,671
you still would've
killed her, right?

452
00:41:52,727 --> 00:41:54,180
I'm sorry.

453
00:41:56,805 --> 00:42:01,100
Do you understand?
I am sorry. I'm sorry.

454
00:42:02,566 --> 00:42:05,902
I... This is my son!

455
00:42:12,577 --> 00:42:13,740
I'm going back.

456
00:42:15,365 --> 00:42:16,780
No, Hurley.

457
00:42:18,168 --> 00:42:19,280
Hurley, you can't.

458
00:42:22,547 --> 00:42:25,800
We're all gonna get killed, and you
knew it, and you let us come anyway.

459
00:42:25,838 --> 00:42:27,681
It's too late to go
back now, Hurley.

460
00:42:27,757 --> 00:42:29,353
We already caught 'em
following us once.

461
00:42:29,388 --> 00:42:32,633
If they don't believe that we
trust Michael, they'll kill us all!

462
00:42:35,056 --> 00:42:36,900
I'm sorry that I
didn't say anything.

463
00:42:39,018 --> 00:42:43,230
But you have to know that I would never
bring you out here if I didn't have
a plan.

464
00:42:45,896 --> 00:42:47,190
What plan?

465
00:43:21,766 --> 00:43:22,682
Sayid!

466
00:43:29,235 --> 00:43:29,982
There.

467
00:43:32,697 --> 00:43:34,741
That's the rock
Michael described.

468
00:43:36,997 --> 00:43:38,163
We're here.

469
00:43:45,378 --> 00:43:46,290
Quick, please.

470
00:43:46,467 --> 00:43:50,540
Wait, Hurley showed me. It's around here
somewhere. It's definitely around...

471
00:43:51,008 --> 00:43:53,053
- It's, uh...
- Quick, Charlie.

472
00:43:53,217 --> 00:43:54,960
We're running out
of time, Charlie.

473
00:43:55,018 --> 00:43:55,632
Yeah, yeah!

474
00:43:56,426 --> 00:43:57,510
Here it is!

475
00:43:59,768 --> 00:44:00,802
Told you.

476
00:44:01,185 --> 00:44:03,011
Careful. Careful.

477
00:44:03,317 --> 00:44:05,141
Dynamite is very unstable.

478
00:44:05,728 --> 00:44:07,851
Don't end up like Dr. Arzt.

479
00:44:13,778 --> 00:44:14,732
Careful.

480
00:44:15,987 --> 00:44:16,941
Eko...

481
00:44:17,578 --> 00:44:19,573
Hey! Eko.

482
00:44:20,995 --> 00:44:22,163
Listen...

483
00:44:23,125 --> 00:44:24,452
What if we hurt them?

484
00:44:25,668 --> 00:44:27,753
Or-- or blow up the computer?

485
00:44:28,466 --> 00:44:30,372
You can leave now, Charlie.

486
00:44:33,596 --> 00:44:36,342
John, it's Charlie!

487
00:44:36,927 --> 00:44:39,381
Let's work this
thing out, John.

488
00:44:39,976 --> 00:44:41,131
John!

489
00:44:41,597 --> 00:44:43,683
Eko is very upset, John.

490
00:44:43,806 --> 00:44:46,402
Let's just open this door,
and we can talk about it.

491
00:44:47,776 --> 00:44:51,852
John, you should know Eko is
gonna blow open the blast door.

492
00:44:52,238 --> 00:44:54,023
Blow it open with what?

493
00:44:54,316 --> 00:44:57,360
With dynamite from the
old ship in the jungle.

494
00:44:57,538 --> 00:44:59,401
It would take an
atom bomb, brother.

495
00:44:59,537 --> 00:45:01,112
Tell them not to bother.

496
00:45:02,115 --> 00:45:03,571
You're sure it'll hold?

497
00:45:04,375 --> 00:45:05,161
Aye.

498
00:45:07,495 --> 00:45:08,620
I'm sure.

499
00:45:21,018 --> 00:45:22,130
You ready?

500
00:45:22,768 --> 00:45:24,052
Maybe you should do it.

501
00:45:24,187 --> 00:45:26,932
Come on, Des,
you've seen me do it a hundred times.

502
00:45:43,787 --> 00:45:50,952
Six... five... four...
three... two... one.

503
00:46:05,765 --> 00:46:08,211
How do you even remember
where you left off from?

504
00:46:09,645 --> 00:46:11,350
Slowly, Des.

505
00:46:12,025 --> 00:46:13,811
Very, very slowly.

506
00:46:20,697 --> 00:46:23,781
Man, you should've seen
Radzinksy do this.

507
00:46:24,207 --> 00:46:27,701
He had photographic memory.
I mean, this whole baby was his idea.

508
00:46:27,997 --> 00:46:29,871
Yeah, right, Radzinsky.

509
00:46:29,995 --> 00:46:31,803
Radzinsky figured out
how to fake a lockdown.

510
00:46:31,838 --> 00:46:36,542
Radzinsky created this
great invisible map.

511
00:46:36,795 --> 00:46:40,061
More and more tales about your
former partner, yet for some reason,

512
00:46:40,098 --> 00:46:42,943
you never wanna tell me what
bloody well happened to him.

513
00:46:50,185 --> 00:46:52,021
See that brown stain there?

514
00:46:54,525 --> 00:46:55,853
That's Radzinsky.

515
00:46:59,695 --> 00:47:02,401
He put a shotgun in his
mouth when I was asleep.

516
00:47:04,367 --> 00:47:08,570
The bitch of it was I only had 108
minutes to bury the poor bastard.

517
00:47:14,757 --> 00:47:18,832
Well, if you don't
want me to go crazy...

518
00:47:19,636 --> 00:47:21,752
next time let me go out.

519
00:47:21,888 --> 00:47:25,342
Oh, you wanna go out there with
the quarantine and the hostiles?

520
00:47:25,595 --> 00:47:28,431
I haven't been outside
for two bloody years.

521
00:47:28,597 --> 00:47:31,073
Yes, I wanna go.
I was in the army, for god's sake!

522
00:47:31,107 --> 00:47:33,933
Oh, right,
her Majesty's army, correct?

523
00:47:34,436 --> 00:47:38,231
Tell me, Desmond, why'd you
leave that nice old lady's army?

524
00:47:39,028 --> 00:47:40,482
Oh, I remember now.

525
00:47:40,568 --> 00:47:43,782
You got kicked out because
you couldn't follow orders.

526
00:47:43,865 --> 00:47:46,111
And why did you leave your army,
Kelvin, huh?

527
00:47:47,918 --> 00:47:50,662
Because men followed my orders.

528
00:47:52,036 --> 00:47:55,330
But then, thank God,
I joined the Dharma initiative.

529
00:47:55,877 --> 00:47:59,333
"Namaste, thank you,
and good luck."

530
00:48:01,888 --> 00:48:03,091
Please, Kelvin.

531
00:48:04,888 --> 00:48:06,672
Let me go out.

532
00:48:07,385 --> 00:48:07,840
Huh?

533
00:48:08,055 --> 00:48:09,303
Just once.

534
00:48:12,937 --> 00:48:17,231
Sorry, Des. You stay here.
You push the button.

535
00:48:18,488 --> 00:48:20,062
That's an order.

536
00:48:24,786 --> 00:48:25,612
John!

537
00:48:26,578 --> 00:48:29,703
Look, seriously,
you're about to be detonated.

538
00:48:37,546 --> 00:48:38,292
Hey.

539
00:48:39,047 --> 00:48:40,582
What if John's right?

540
00:48:40,927 --> 00:48:43,501
Maybe it's just
some colossal joke.

541
00:48:43,797 --> 00:48:46,742
You know, it's just some old
computer connected to nothing.

542
00:48:47,175 --> 00:48:49,173
Maybe it's just a
bunch of wires that...

543
00:48:58,856 --> 00:48:59,980
Is that a joke?

544
00:49:05,028 --> 00:49:06,323
I'll see myself out.

545
00:49:15,248 --> 00:49:19,792
John, this is your last
chance to end this.

546
00:49:20,468 --> 00:49:22,961
Open the door,
and I will forgive you.

547
00:49:24,676 --> 00:49:26,341
Forgive me for what?!

548
00:49:34,096 --> 00:49:35,261
Hey.

549
00:49:35,807 --> 00:49:37,813
Hey. Eko?

550
00:49:38,107 --> 00:49:39,221
Wait.

551
00:49:39,735 --> 00:49:41,441
Just wait a second.

552
00:49:42,106 --> 00:49:44,403
I don't think it's
a good idea, Eko.

553
00:49:44,867 --> 00:49:47,693
We're in a very confined area.

554
00:49:53,078 --> 00:49:54,742
Oh, bollocks!

555
00:50:12,346 --> 00:50:13,262
Kelvin!

556
00:50:15,596 --> 00:50:16,602
Hey, Kelvin!

557
00:50:52,808 --> 00:50:54,470
I couldn't do it.

558
00:50:56,438 --> 00:50:57,761
I couldn't do it.

559
00:51:06,357 --> 00:51:07,653
What is this?

560
00:51:07,906 --> 00:51:11,022
This is the only other
way out, partner.

561
00:51:11,325 --> 00:51:13,821
- What are you talking about?
- Fail-safe.

562
00:51:14,077 --> 00:51:17,201
Just turn the key,
and this all goes away.

563
00:51:21,838 --> 00:51:24,121
What's behind that
wall, Kelvin?

564
00:51:24,795 --> 00:51:25,873
Huh?

565
00:51:27,468 --> 00:51:29,170
What was the "incident"?

566
00:51:29,798 --> 00:51:32,002
Electromagnetism.

567
00:51:32,176 --> 00:51:34,212
Geologically unique.

568
00:51:34,806 --> 00:51:38,222
The incident--
there was a leak.

569
00:51:38,398 --> 00:51:41,930
So now the charge builds up,
and every time we push the button,

570
00:51:42,438 --> 00:51:44,470
it discharges it...

571
00:51:44,857 --> 00:51:47,273
before it gets too big.

572
00:51:51,067 --> 00:51:53,573
Why make us do it--
push the button?

573
00:51:53,947 --> 00:51:55,823
If we-- if we can just...

574
00:52:02,126 --> 00:52:05,752
Now here's the real
question, Desmond--

575
00:52:05,958 --> 00:52:11,291
do you have the courage to take
your finger out of the dam

576
00:52:11,427 --> 00:52:14,253
and blow the whole
thing up instead?

577
00:52:19,768 --> 00:52:22,892
I think your friends just
blew themselves up, brother.

578
00:52:23,687 --> 00:52:25,351
They're not my friends.

579
00:52:26,485 --> 00:52:28,193
I can't hear anything.

580
00:52:28,737 --> 00:52:32,113
- Maybe we should open it.
- No, no!

581
00:52:32,988 --> 00:52:34,150
It's a trick.

582
00:52:34,327 --> 00:52:37,783
A trick? They could be hurt.

583
00:52:38,207 --> 00:52:39,662
Is your doctor around?

584
00:52:39,995 --> 00:52:44,280
Our doctor is...
God knows where. I...

585
00:52:44,836 --> 00:52:48,412
And he sure as hell doesn't care
about anything happening down here.

586
00:52:49,926 --> 00:52:51,631
Can I ask you a
question, brother?

587
00:52:52,887 --> 00:52:54,380
Absolutely.

588
00:52:56,056 --> 00:52:59,630
Is the reason you're
letting that clock there

589
00:52:59,806 --> 00:53:02,510
run all the way down to
the very last tick...

590
00:53:03,515 --> 00:53:06,261
Is it because you need to
look down the barrel of a gun

591
00:53:07,318 --> 00:53:10,062
and find out what you
really believe, John?

592
00:53:11,236 --> 00:53:16,190
I looked downthe barrel of the gun,
and I believed.

593
00:53:16,907 --> 00:53:18,491
I thought...

594
00:53:19,156 --> 00:53:24,240
it was my destiny to
get into this... place.

595
00:53:25,246 --> 00:53:28,583
And-- and somebody died,
you know, a kid--

596
00:53:29,205 --> 00:53:33,081
because he was stupid enough to believe
that I knew what I was talking about.

597
00:53:33,218 --> 00:53:36,711
And on the night that
he died for nothing,

598
00:53:36,928 --> 00:53:40,220
I was sitting right
up there all alone,

599
00:53:40,425 --> 00:53:46,600
beating my hand bloody against that...
stupid door,

600
00:53:47,015 --> 00:53:50,183
screaming to the heavens,
asking what I should do.

601
00:53:50,275 --> 00:53:52,981
And then a light went on.

602
00:53:54,275 --> 00:53:56,442
I thought it was a sign.

603
00:54:00,196 --> 00:54:02,281
But it wasn't a sign.

604
00:54:04,037 --> 00:54:07,123
Probably just you
going to the bathroom.

605
00:55:43,558 --> 00:55:44,630
Jack?

606
00:56:05,445 --> 00:56:06,533
What are they?

607
00:56:23,007 --> 00:56:24,511
It's handwritten.

608
00:56:24,925 --> 00:56:27,050
And it's all filled--
the whole book.

609
00:56:27,175 --> 00:56:28,841
They're journal entries.

610
00:56:31,936 --> 00:56:35,350
"0400-- S.R.
Moves ping-pong table again.

611
00:56:35,605 --> 00:56:38,191
0415-- takes a shower."

612
00:56:38,318 --> 00:56:39,731
What is this?

613
00:56:39,906 --> 00:56:43,073
Hey, doc. What'd you say
Sayid's signal was gonna be

614
00:56:43,198 --> 00:56:45,980
when the coast was clear
to hit that beach party?

615
00:56:47,446 --> 00:56:49,860
That means he
found them, right?

616
00:56:50,205 --> 00:56:52,121
That's miles from here.

617
00:56:55,548 --> 00:56:57,910
Where were you taking us?

618
00:56:58,917 --> 00:56:59,753
What?

619
00:56:59,925 --> 00:57:02,813
Sayid said he'd light the signal so
that we could meet him at the shore.

620
00:57:02,848 --> 00:57:04,310
Why aren't we
going to the beach?

621
00:57:04,348 --> 00:57:06,482
- We are headed to the--
- We're nowhere near the beach!

622
00:57:06,518 --> 00:57:08,051
- Listen, I had to--
- What?!

623
00:57:21,908 --> 00:57:22,652
Sawyer!

624
00:57:28,538 --> 00:57:31,200
Run! Go! Go!

625
00:58:13,116 --> 00:58:17,200
Tell me about this other hatch
you found-- this... Pearl.

626
00:58:18,707 --> 00:58:19,910
What do you wanna know?

627
00:58:20,046 --> 00:58:20,831
Details.

628
00:58:21,126 --> 00:58:25,420
The earl is a psychological
station full of TV monitors,

629
00:58:25,508 --> 00:58:29,632
and, uh, two men sat in viewing
chairs and filled notebooks

630
00:58:29,808 --> 00:58:32,262
with observations on
what happens in here,

631
00:58:32,428 --> 00:58:34,730
and then they put the
notebooks in pneumatic tubes

632
00:58:34,766 --> 00:58:36,521
that sent them backto
their headquarters

633
00:58:36,556 --> 00:58:40,431
so they could evaluate
us as an experiment.

634
00:58:47,066 --> 00:58:47,982
What?

635
00:58:49,448 --> 00:58:51,042
What if you've
got it backwards?

636
00:58:51,117 --> 00:58:51,991
Backwards?

637
00:58:52,655 --> 00:58:56,081
What if the experiment wasn't on the two
men in here but on the two men
in there?

638
00:58:56,118 --> 00:58:57,753
Look, I wanna see
that tape, John.

639
00:58:57,785 --> 00:59:00,131
No, you can't.
There's no way to see it down here.

640
00:59:00,165 --> 00:59:02,130
Well, was there anything
elsein that station?

641
00:59:02,167 --> 00:59:04,291
- Was there a computer?
- Yeah.

642
00:59:04,586 --> 00:59:07,251
- So what did it do?
- Nothin'. It didn't do anything.

643
00:59:07,388 --> 00:59:09,640
It printed out numbers--
lots and lots of numbers.

644
00:59:09,676 --> 00:59:11,212
What printout? Where is it?

645
00:59:11,345 --> 00:59:15,930
Here. Reading material for the next
19 minutes. Knock yourself out.

646
00:59:31,538 --> 00:59:34,860
You've been shaving every
day for the last three years.

647
00:59:35,076 --> 00:59:37,452
You need to live a little.
Let go.

648
00:59:38,125 --> 00:59:40,033
I'm never gonna
let go, brother.

649
00:59:42,336 --> 00:59:43,873
Oh, that's the spirit.

650
00:59:45,376 --> 00:59:46,792
Good-bye, Des.

651
00:59:50,255 --> 00:59:51,301
Good-bye?

652
00:59:53,675 --> 00:59:58,641
Yeah. Good-bye.
See you in a couple hours.

653
01:02:11,358 --> 01:02:14,810
Well, gosh, I didn't think you
had the stones to come after me.

654
01:02:16,905 --> 01:02:20,693
I was a spook for ten years, Des.
I know when I'm being followed.

655
01:02:20,948 --> 01:02:22,570
What are you doin'
with my boat?

656
01:02:22,788 --> 01:02:23,912
I'm fixing it.

657
01:02:24,996 --> 01:02:26,582
You were leaving?

658
01:02:26,708 --> 01:02:29,662
Well, I mean, not yet.
She's still about a week away.

659
01:02:29,758 --> 01:02:31,961
You wrecked her
pretty good, Des.

660
01:02:33,125 --> 01:02:36,132
So what do you think?
You wanna come with me?

661
01:02:36,678 --> 01:02:38,250
Come where?!

662
01:02:39,058 --> 01:02:40,171
What about the button?

663
01:02:41,555 --> 01:02:45,471
Screw the button, man.
Who knows if it's even real?

664
01:02:45,976 --> 01:02:47,940
That's not what you said when
you were going on and on

665
01:02:47,978 --> 01:02:50,473
about dams and electromagnetics
and fail-safes!

666
01:02:50,645 --> 01:02:51,813
Well, I was drunk.

667
01:02:52,687 --> 01:02:53,943
Why did you lie to me?!

668
01:02:54,025 --> 01:02:57,610
I lied to you because I needed a
sucker to save the world after I left.

669
01:02:58,576 --> 01:02:59,981
You're crazy. You bastard!

670
01:03:00,116 --> 01:03:01,993
- Oh, come on.
- You stole my life!

671
01:03:02,327 --> 01:03:05,861
What else did you lie to me about?!
What else?! Tell me!

672
01:03:10,748 --> 01:03:12,371
How could you do this to me?!

673
01:03:13,836 --> 01:03:14,621
Get up.

674
01:03:21,467 --> 01:03:23,670
Oh, my god.

675
01:03:51,496 --> 01:03:57,460
System failure. System failure.

676
01:04:12,318 --> 01:04:13,060
Come on!

677
01:04:56,776 --> 01:04:58,350
What are you doing?

678
01:05:01,908 --> 01:05:03,270
When did you come here?

679
01:05:03,776 --> 01:05:04,692
What?

680
01:05:06,285 --> 01:05:08,701
The island.
When did you come here?

681
01:05:08,786 --> 01:05:11,412
- How long ago?
- 60, 65 days.

682
01:05:11,575 --> 01:05:13,173
What was the date?
What was the date?

683
01:05:13,205 --> 01:05:14,793
September 22nd.

684
01:05:17,378 --> 01:05:19,290
It was september 22nd.

685
01:05:27,427 --> 01:05:29,473
I think I crashed your plane.

686
01:05:55,205 --> 01:05:57,081
Son of a bitch,
I'll kick your...

687
01:05:57,625 --> 01:05:58,370
Hey!

688
01:06:00,005 --> 01:06:01,962
Everybody just calm down.

689
01:06:04,888 --> 01:06:06,093
It's fake.

690
01:06:06,308 --> 01:06:08,923
We know that your
beard is fake.

691
01:06:09,218 --> 01:06:10,762
Sorry, missy. I didn't get ya.

692
01:06:10,847 --> 01:06:13,642
She said she knows your
beard's fake, Tom.

693
01:06:14,898 --> 01:06:17,311
Well, thanks for
pointing that out, Kate.

694
01:06:17,766 --> 01:06:20,062
I can't tell you how
much this thing itches.

695
01:06:20,736 --> 01:06:23,400
And thanks for telling
'em my name, Bea.

696
01:07:11,827 --> 01:07:12,742
Hello again.

697
01:07:21,668 --> 01:07:22,750
Where's your beard?

698
01:07:24,298 --> 01:07:26,212
I think they... know.

699
01:07:34,558 --> 01:07:37,002
All right,
let's take care of business, shall we?

700
01:08:09,635 --> 01:08:12,460
Eko! Eko!

701
01:08:18,807 --> 01:08:19,471
Hey.

702
01:08:19,557 --> 01:08:21,763
It's Charlie! Wake up!

703
01:08:25,987 --> 01:08:28,182
- We need to push the button.
- No, we don't!

704
01:08:28,407 --> 01:08:30,743
Did you not hear me, brother?
I crashed your bloody plane.

705
01:08:30,777 --> 01:08:31,990
How did you manage to do that?

706
01:08:32,027 --> 01:08:34,572
On that day,
those numbers turned to hieroglyphics,

707
01:08:34,617 --> 01:08:37,213
and when the last one came down,
this whole place started to shake,

708
01:08:37,247 --> 01:08:40,002
and that screen-- that screen
filled up with "system failure."

709
01:08:40,038 --> 01:08:43,702
"System failure"!
And that number there-- 92204--

710
01:08:43,837 --> 01:08:47,043
September the 22nd, 2004--
the day your plane crashed.

711
01:08:47,167 --> 01:08:51,460
It's real! It's all bloody real! Now
push the damn button! I know what I saw!

712
01:08:51,796 --> 01:08:55,420
It's a lie! It's not real!
None of it is real!

713
01:08:56,516 --> 01:08:58,482
You don't wanna push the button?
Then I will.

714
01:08:58,516 --> 01:08:59,130
No.

715
01:09:12,368 --> 01:09:13,572
You've killed us.

716
01:09:14,696 --> 01:09:16,492
You've killed us all.

717
01:09:16,996 --> 01:09:17,690
No.

718
01:09:19,706 --> 01:09:21,411
I've just saved us all.

719
01:09:33,546 --> 01:09:36,133
Hey! Eko! Wake up!

720
01:09:37,806 --> 01:09:38,671
Hey!

721
01:09:39,015 --> 01:09:41,092
Hey! Can I get some help?!

722
01:09:41,227 --> 01:09:43,272
- Can you help me?!
- I'm trying, brother.

723
01:10:33,605 --> 01:10:35,482
Dearest des,

724
01:10:36,028 --> 01:10:39,070
I am writing this letter to
you as you leave for prison,

725
01:10:39,366 --> 01:10:41,453
and I've hidden it
in the one place

726
01:10:41,536 --> 01:10:45,243
you would turn to in a
moment of great desperation.

727
01:10:45,416 --> 01:10:49,202
I know you go away with the weight
of what happened on your shoulders,

728
01:10:49,338 --> 01:10:53,541
and I know the only person who
can ever take it off is you.

729
01:10:54,465 --> 01:10:57,003
Please don't give up, Des,

730
01:10:57,296 --> 01:11:02,670
because all we really need to survive
is one person who truly loves us.

731
01:11:02,846 --> 01:11:04,681
And you have her.

732
01:11:05,478 --> 01:11:08,060
I will wait for you. Always.

733
01:11:08,146 --> 01:11:09,850
I love you.

734
01:11:09,976 --> 01:11:10,810
Pen.

735
01:11:25,287 --> 01:11:26,450
It's all gone!

736
01:11:35,928 --> 01:11:40,672
It's all...
it's all gone! All gone!

737
01:12:22,887 --> 01:12:25,551
I've done everything
you wanted me to do!

738
01:12:25,677 --> 01:12:29,051
So why did you do this?! Why?!

739
01:13:08,387 --> 01:13:11,801
Three days before you came down here,
before we met,

740
01:13:11,895 --> 01:13:14,193
I heard a banging on the
hatch door, shouting.

741
01:13:14,318 --> 01:13:16,480
But it was you,
John, wasn't it?

742
01:13:16,685 --> 01:13:19,623
You say there isn't any purpose,
there's no such thing as fate?

743
01:13:19,658 --> 01:13:22,733
But you saved my life, brother,
so that I could save yours.

744
01:13:22,816 --> 01:13:25,480
No, no! No!
None of this is real!

745
01:13:25,575 --> 01:13:28,150
Nothing is gonna happen.
We're gonna be okay.

746
01:13:29,287 --> 01:13:32,953
I've got to go, and you've got to get
as far away from here as possible.

747
01:13:33,088 --> 01:13:34,412
Go where?! Stop!

748
01:13:34,548 --> 01:13:36,330
I'm gonna blow the dam, John.

749
01:13:37,968 --> 01:13:41,333
I'm sorry for whatever happened
that made you stop believing,

750
01:13:41,425 --> 01:13:43,341
but it's all real.

751
01:13:44,717 --> 01:13:47,462
And now I've got to go
and make it all go away.

752
01:13:48,058 --> 01:13:49,970
Wait! Desmond!

753
01:13:51,097 --> 01:13:52,991
I'll see you in
another life, brother.

754
01:13:56,565 --> 01:14:01,522
System failure.

755
01:14:01,408 --> 01:14:05,442
Eko! Wake up!

756
01:14:10,958 --> 01:14:11,992
Are you all right?

757
01:14:49,238 --> 01:14:50,281
Oh, look out!

758
01:14:52,248 --> 01:14:54,112
All right,
come with me! Charlie...

759
01:14:54,286 --> 01:14:55,622
No! I don't...

760
01:14:55,787 --> 01:14:57,032
Get out of here, Charlie!

761
01:15:29,328 --> 01:15:30,860
I was wrong.

762
01:15:52,766 --> 01:15:57,930
All we really need to survive is
one person who truly loves us.

763
01:15:58,055 --> 01:15:59,932
And you have her.

764
01:16:00,227 --> 01:16:01,970
I will wait for you.

765
01:16:02,477 --> 01:16:03,733
Always.

766
01:16:05,645 --> 01:16:07,151
I love you.

767
01:16:08,866 --> 01:16:10,612
I love you, Penny.

768
01:17:35,618 --> 01:17:36,610
Charlie?

769
01:17:41,208 --> 01:17:42,530
You okay?

770
01:17:42,706 --> 01:17:47,580
Uh, it's... it's hard to tell,
exactly, but my ears, you know?

771
01:17:47,836 --> 01:17:49,542
Where's Locke? Eko?

772
01:17:50,126 --> 01:17:51,790
They're not back yet?

773
01:17:52,337 --> 01:17:53,420
No.

774
01:18:05,475 --> 01:18:08,901
I'm not happy about the arrangement
that was made with you, Michael, but

775
01:18:08,935 --> 01:18:12,353
we got more thanwe bargained
for when Walt joined us, so

776
01:18:12,948 --> 01:18:15,402
I suppose this is what's best.

777
01:18:17,405 --> 01:18:19,821
And you let me go, set me free.

778
01:18:20,206 --> 01:18:22,873
You lived up to your word.

779
01:18:26,128 --> 01:18:28,910
We live up to our word, too.

780
01:18:30,545 --> 01:18:32,140
Do you know how
to drive a boat?

781
01:18:32,218 --> 01:18:33,630
Yeah, I can drive a boat.

782
01:18:33,758 --> 01:18:35,710
Good. Then you're
gonna take this boat

783
01:18:35,758 --> 01:18:37,552
and follow a compass
bearing of 325,

784
01:18:37,757 --> 01:18:41,380
and if you do that exactly,
ou and your son will find rescue.

785
01:18:42,807 --> 01:18:43,681
What, that's it?

786
01:18:44,478 --> 01:18:47,681
I follow the bearing,
and me and my son get rescued.

787
01:18:48,025 --> 01:18:48,890
Yes.

788
01:18:50,185 --> 01:18:53,312
How do you know I won't tell
people about where I was?

789
01:18:55,278 --> 01:18:57,482
Maybe you will,
maybe you won't.

790
01:18:58,825 --> 01:19:00,243
But it won't matter.

791
01:19:00,406 --> 01:19:03,101
Once you leave,
you'll never be able to get back here.

792
01:19:04,825 --> 01:19:07,533
And my hunch is you won't
say a word to anybody.

793
01:19:07,666 --> 01:19:08,912
Because if you do,

794
01:19:09,085 --> 01:19:12,370
people will find out what
you did  get your son back.

795
01:19:18,218 --> 01:19:19,800
My friends.

796
01:19:19,968 --> 01:19:21,970
I was promised you
wouldn't hurt them.

797
01:19:22,476 --> 01:19:24,642
Deal's a deal.

798
01:19:28,688 --> 01:19:32,023
Who are you people?

799
01:19:33,858 --> 01:19:35,940
We're the good guys, Michael.

800
01:19:43,536 --> 01:19:45,362
All right. She's all yours.

801
01:19:46,248 --> 01:19:49,162
What? What am I, stupid?
Where is my son?!

802
01:19:49,337 --> 01:19:50,541
Walt's inside.

803
01:19:55,257 --> 01:19:56,121
Walt?

804
01:19:58,097 --> 01:20:00,133
Bon voyage, Michael.

805
01:20:04,227 --> 01:20:05,181
Walt!

806
01:20:06,267 --> 01:20:08,353
Dad! Dad!

807
01:20:08,976 --> 01:20:10,760
Come here, come here.

808
01:20:24,658 --> 01:20:26,242
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

809
01:20:26,455 --> 01:20:29,161
You're sure? Okay.
I got you now.

810
01:20:29,418 --> 01:20:33,163
It's gonna be okay now. We're going
home, Walt. We are going home.

811
01:20:58,405 --> 01:21:01,821
Hugo, you can go
back to your camp.

812
01:21:03,697 --> 01:21:04,822
What?

813
01:21:06,117 --> 01:21:07,573
Go back.

814
01:21:07,867 --> 01:21:10,783
Your job is to tell
the rest of your people

815
01:21:10,997 --> 01:21:13,040
they can never come here.

816
01:21:13,546 --> 01:21:16,463
But... what about my friends?

817
01:21:18,466 --> 01:21:20,922
Your friends are
coming home with us.

818
01:21:27,055 --> 01:21:27,881
Go.

819
01:23:05,656 --> 01:23:07,822
What happened out
there, Charlie?

820
01:23:09,616 --> 01:23:11,363
You wanna hear
the part about me

821
01:23:11,458 --> 01:23:16,032
nearly being killed by the flaming
fireball or the flying fork?

822
01:23:16,245 --> 01:23:18,663
I want you to be serious.

823
01:23:20,955 --> 01:23:22,870
Nothing happened.

824
01:23:23,756 --> 01:23:25,540
Well, something happened.

825
01:23:25,837 --> 01:23:29,963
I mean, that noise and the sky
turned that weird violet color.

826
01:23:30,096 --> 01:23:30,840
Did it?

827
01:24:46,088 --> 01:24:47,881


828
01:24:48,085 --> 01:24:50,922


829
01:24:52,505 --> 01:24:54,923


830
01:24:55,095 --> 01:24:57,220


831
01:24:57,597 --> 01:24:59,050


832
01:25:03,818 --> 01:25:04,850


833
01:25:06,487 --> 01:25:08,813


834
01:25:13,985 --> 01:25:17,530


835
01:25:17,577 --> 01:25:19,910


836
01:25:24,245 --> 01:25:26,833


837
01:25:28,297 --> 01:25:30,462


838
01:25:45,438 --> 01:25:47,311
- Hello?
- Miss Widmore?

839
01:25:47,605 --> 01:25:49,943
- Yes?
- It's us.

840
01:25:52,318 --> 01:25:54,020
I think we found it.
