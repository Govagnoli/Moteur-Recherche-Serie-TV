1
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:21,351
Charlie.

2
00:00:21,988 --> 00:00:23,319
Charlie.

3
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:27,087
- How about you and l go for a walk?
- No.

4
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:29,424
No thanks, Locke.
l'm gonna stay in today.

5
00:00:29,496 --> 00:00:30,963
[Locke] Come on.

6
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:33,397
Fresh air will do you good.

7
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:42,399
[Kate] l take better pictures than that.

8
00:00:45,678 --> 00:00:49,011
Smaller too, if you want
something for your wallet.

9
00:00:49,516 --> 00:00:52,451
l just came by for a few things
and this was. . .

10
00:00:53,319 --> 00:00:55,480
This was with my stuff.

11
00:00:58,224 --> 00:00:59,657
So you're not staying?

12
00:00:59,726 --> 00:01:03,526
Call me a broken record,
but caves are natural shelter.

13
00:01:03,596 --> 00:01:06,156
And a hell of a lot safer
than living on the beach.

14
00:01:06,933 --> 00:01:09,060
- You're mad at me.
- No.

15
00:01:09,135 --> 00:01:11,194
Kate, l'm. . .

16
00:01:12,338 --> 00:01:14,932
l just don't understand
why you won't come with me.

17
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:18,102
Us. lt's maybe a mile up there. lf that.

18
00:01:18,178 --> 00:01:21,272
- l'm not setting up house here.
- l want off this island too,

19
00:01:21,347 --> 00:01:23,542
but we know that's not
gonna happen soon.

20
00:01:23,616 --> 00:01:24,605
Sayid has a plan.

21
00:01:24,684 --> 00:01:26,845
To find the source
of the distress code.

22
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:29,047
The signal's coming from the island.

23
00:01:29,122 --> 00:01:32,683
The signal has been running on a loop
for 1 6 years, Kate.

24
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:35,250
And the woman that left it,
she wasn't rescued.

25
00:01:35,328 --> 00:01:37,626
What makes you think
it'll be any different?

26
00:01:37,697 --> 00:01:39,096
l believe it.

27
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:41,032
l wish l shared your faith.

28
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:43,797
l wouldn't mind sharing a few things
with her myself.

29
00:01:45,338 --> 00:01:46,965
What do you want, Sawyer?

30
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,508
Heard the doc here
was vacating the premises.

31
00:01:49,576 --> 00:01:52,841
Thought l'd lay claims to my new digs
before somebody else.

32
00:01:53,713 --> 00:01:57,046
l could fix this place up.
Might find somebody to share it with.

33
00:01:57,117 --> 00:01:58,778
l'll talk to you later.

34
00:02:04,858 --> 00:02:07,520
[insects chirping, birds calling]

35
00:02:10,597 --> 00:02:13,122
[snorting, rustling]

36
00:02:15,001 --> 00:02:16,298
Locke?

37
00:02:16,369 --> 00:02:18,166
[snorting]

38
00:02:18,238 --> 00:02:20,536
ls that you?

39
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:30,215
[loud squealing]

40
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:39,557
[Charlie] Bless me, Father,
for l have sinned.

41
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:45,760
lt's been a week
since my last confession.

42
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:48,130
Go ahead, my son.

43
00:02:48,201 --> 00:02:53,332
Last night,
l had physical relations

44
00:02:53,406 --> 00:02:56,341
with a girl l didn't even know.

45
00:02:56,409 --> 00:02:58,309
l see.

46
00:02:58,378 --> 00:03:01,643
- Anything else?
- Yeah.

47
00:03:01,714 --> 00:03:04,740
Right after that l had. . .

48
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:09,083
...relations with another girl.

49
00:03:10,423 --> 00:03:13,984
Then straight after that,
l watched

50
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:16,426
while they had...

51
00:03:17,297 --> 00:03:19,993
...relations with each other.

52
00:03:21,901 --> 00:03:24,461
You see, it's my band, Father.

53
00:03:24,537 --> 00:03:26,004
Drive Shaft.

54
00:03:26,072 --> 00:03:30,304
We've been playing the clubs
in Manchester

55
00:03:30,376 --> 00:03:33,675
and we've been getting some heat.

56
00:03:33,746 --> 00:03:37,409
A following, you know, and...

57
00:03:38,418 --> 00:03:40,545
The girls. . .

58
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:45,421
There's some real temptations
that come with the territory...

59
00:03:45,491 --> 00:03:48,119
...if you know what l mean.

60
00:03:48,194 --> 00:03:50,219
Well, we all have our temptations,

61
00:03:50,296 --> 00:03:53,231
but giving in to them,
that's your choice.

62
00:03:53,299 --> 00:03:55,767
As we live our lives,

63
00:03:55,835 --> 00:03:59,168
it's really nothing but a series
of choices, isn't it?

64
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:03,304
Well, then l've made my choice.

65
00:04:03,376 --> 00:04:05,867
l have to quit the band.

66
00:04:05,945 --> 00:04:08,846
[church bells ringing]

67
00:04:16,422 --> 00:04:18,947
[tapping]

68
00:04:23,129 --> 00:04:25,290
And ''the meek shall inherit the earth.''

69
00:04:25,365 --> 00:04:27,629
Liam, what are you doing?
This is a church.

70
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:30,191
- Get your boots off.
- Relax, choir boy.

71
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:33,068
l bring good tidings of great joy.

72
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:37,640
We've just been signed.
A recording contract.

73
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:40,144
You're gonna be a rock god.

74
00:04:41,481 --> 00:04:44,917
[roaring, squealing]

75
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:55,893
[squealing]

76
00:05:00,033 --> 00:05:02,433
Nice work, Charlie.

77
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:06,561
You make excellent bait.

78
00:05:07,573 --> 00:05:09,768
l'm glad l could oblige.

79
00:05:11,244 --> 00:05:13,542
Now give me my bloody drugs.

80
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:37,534
Did you hear what l said?

81
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:41,872
l want my drugs back.
l need them.

82
00:05:41,941 --> 00:05:44,102
Yet you gave them to me.

83
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:46,111
And l bloody well regret it.

84
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:48,306
l'm sick, man.
Can't you see that?

85
00:05:48,381 --> 00:05:51,214
l think you're a lot stronger
than you know, Charlie.

86
00:05:51,284 --> 00:05:52,842
And l'm gonna prove it to you.

87
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:55,387
l'll let you ask me for your drugs
three times.

88
00:05:55,455 --> 00:05:57,446
The third time,
l'll give them to you.

89
00:05:57,523 --> 00:06:00,856
Now, just so we're clear.
This is one.

90
00:06:01,394 --> 00:06:03,123
Why? Why?

91
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:05,630
Why are you doing this?
To torture me?

92
00:06:05,698 --> 00:06:07,563
Get rid of them
and have done with it.

93
00:06:07,633 --> 00:06:09,760
lf l did that,
you wouldn't have a choice.

94
00:06:09,836 --> 00:06:13,169
Having choices, making decisions
based on more than instinct

95
00:06:13,239 --> 00:06:16,470
is the only thing
that separates you from him.

96
00:06:18,745 --> 00:06:21,270
- [squealing]
- [splattering]

97
00:06:21,781 --> 00:06:23,681
Three antennae.

98
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:25,775
Three points of a triangle.

99
00:06:25,852 --> 00:06:27,410
One here on the beach.

100
00:06:27,487 --> 00:06:31,753
Another, Kate will position in the
jungle, roughly two kilometers in.

101
00:06:31,824 --> 00:06:36,124
And the third, l'll take
to high ground up there.

102
00:06:36,195 --> 00:06:40,495
lf the French transmission is coming
from somewhere within our triangulation,

103
00:06:40,566 --> 00:06:42,659
l'll be able to locate the source.

104
00:06:42,735 --> 00:06:45,761
- But there are two complications.
- Of course there are.

105
00:06:45,838 --> 00:06:49,740
The power cells l've grafted
onto the antennas are dry.

106
00:06:49,809 --> 00:06:51,606
No telling how long they'll last.

107
00:06:51,677 --> 00:06:54,908
A minute. Maybe more.
Maybe less.

108
00:06:54,981 --> 00:06:58,007
So we have to wait
until we're in position.

109
00:06:58,084 --> 00:07:01,110
How are we gonna tell
that we're in the right position?

110
00:07:01,187 --> 00:07:03,655
We have no way to communicate
with each other.

111
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:07,081
Bottle rockets?

112
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:10,288
Thank God for firework smugglers.
When l'm in position,

113
00:07:10,363 --> 00:07:12,024
l'll fire off my rocket.

114
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:14,999
When you two see it,
you fire yours.

115
00:07:15,067 --> 00:07:19,595
As soon as the last one has gone up,
we'll all switch on our antennas.

116
00:07:19,672 --> 00:07:23,438
- You said two complications.
- The battery in the transceiver's dead.

117
00:07:23,509 --> 00:07:26,808
Without the transceiver,
all of this is for nothing.

118
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:29,245
Something from a laptop
would probably work,

119
00:07:29,315 --> 00:07:33,445
- but l've not found anything.
- l think l might know where to look.

120
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:39,285
You've been hoarding like a packrat,
and you don't have a single laptop?

121
00:07:39,358 --> 00:07:41,326
We are testy.

122
00:07:41,394 --> 00:07:44,295
Still upset about your little breakup?
You and Jacko.

123
00:07:44,363 --> 00:07:45,728
lt must be exhausting.

124
00:07:45,798 --> 00:07:48,995
- What's that?
- Living like a parasite.

125
00:07:49,068 --> 00:07:51,832
Always taking, never giving.

126
00:07:51,904 --> 00:07:53,838
Boy, you got me pegged,
don't you?

127
00:07:53,906 --> 00:07:58,536
l get it. You don't want off this island
because there's nothing to go back for.

128
00:07:58,611 --> 00:08:01,637
Nobody you miss.
And no one misses you.

129
00:08:02,582 --> 00:08:04,777
Oh, you're feeling sorry for me.

130
00:08:05,284 --> 00:08:09,311
l don't feel sorry for you.
l pity you.

131
00:08:16,195 --> 00:08:18,527
[sighing]

132
00:08:20,266 --> 00:08:23,099
All you had to do was say please.

133
00:08:30,109 --> 00:08:32,600
[Hurley] What's in these things,
cinder blocks?

134
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:36,774
Packed everything l thought useful,
without leaving the others short-handed.

135
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:38,077
You guys need a hand?

136
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:40,482
l used to lug the band's equipment

137
00:08:40,553 --> 00:08:43,488
before we had roadies,
way back in the day.

138
00:08:43,556 --> 00:08:46,252
- Here, let me. . .
- [Jack] No, Charlie. The zipper's. . .

139
00:08:46,692 --> 00:08:47,818
...broken.

140
00:08:50,396 --> 00:08:53,126
- Sorry. l was trying to help.
- l know. lt's okay.

141
00:08:54,567 --> 00:08:57,195
Hey, you wanna help me grab
the rest of those bags?

142
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:59,966
Oh, could l?

143
00:09:11,617 --> 00:09:13,278
What are you doing?

144
00:09:13,819 --> 00:09:17,550
Oh, uh... l have a. . . headache.

145
00:09:20,826 --> 00:09:22,885
Diazepam.

146
00:09:22,962 --> 00:09:24,224
lt's for anxiety.

147
00:09:24,764 --> 00:09:28,996
- l was looking for aspirin.
- Pretty strong stuff for a headache.

148
00:09:29,602 --> 00:09:32,230
- Yeah, right.
- Hey.

149
00:09:32,305 --> 00:09:36,207
- You okay? You're looking a little. . .
- lt's nothing. lt's just a headache.

150
00:09:37,944 --> 00:09:41,243
Charlie, leave it. Go get some water.
Maybe you're dehydrated.

151
00:09:41,314 --> 00:09:42,406
Charlie, l got it.

152
00:09:43,749 --> 00:09:46,013
Go take care of yourself, man.

153
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:48,344
l don't need you right now.

154
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:03,664
[church bells ringing]

155
00:10:03,736 --> 00:10:06,728
[Liam] Come on, Charlie-boy,
we can't do this without you.

156
00:10:06,806 --> 00:10:10,435
You are bloody Drive Shaft.

157
00:10:10,509 --> 00:10:12,943
Watch the language.

158
00:10:13,012 --> 00:10:15,242
This is our shot at the big time.

159
00:10:15,314 --> 00:10:17,407
What? You don't want to be famous?

160
00:10:17,483 --> 00:10:20,077
lt's not about that.
l only care about the music.

161
00:10:20,152 --> 00:10:22,416
Your music,
your songs that got us signed.

162
00:10:22,488 --> 00:10:25,150
l'm just a clown with a pretty face
that sings them.

163
00:10:25,224 --> 00:10:27,715
You wanna take away my chance
to be somebody?

164
00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:29,590
Liam, it's not about you.

165
00:10:29,662 --> 00:10:32,062
lt's. . . l love the band. . .

166
00:10:34,667 --> 00:10:38,262
lt's not who l am.
Sometimes l just get lost in it.

167
00:10:38,337 --> 00:10:40,931
Won't happen.
l'll be there looking out for you.

168
00:10:41,007 --> 00:10:44,204
We'll look out for each other.
What brothers do, right?

169
00:10:44,276 --> 00:10:46,403
Right?

170
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:48,640
Wait, wait, wait.

171
00:10:48,714 --> 00:10:50,682
Just promise me one thing.

172
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:54,083
lf things get too crazy,
no matter what,

173
00:10:54,153 --> 00:10:57,748
if l say we're done, we walk away.

174
00:10:58,824 --> 00:11:02,385
- We walk away.
- Liam, promise.

175
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:06,723
We walk away.

176
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:08,664
You're the rock god, baby brother.

177
00:11:13,105 --> 00:11:14,572
- You wanker!
- [giggling]

178
00:11:23,916 --> 00:11:26,214
Oh!

179
00:11:26,285 --> 00:11:28,412
[speaking in Korean]

180
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:52,435
Hey, dude, this yours?

181
00:11:52,511 --> 00:11:53,876
Oh, yeah.

182
00:11:53,946 --> 00:11:56,210
l play bass in Drive Shaft.

183
00:11:56,282 --> 00:11:59,046
l wrote a bunch of tunes on that.
<i>You All Everybody.</i>

184
00:11:59,118 --> 00:12:02,554
Listen, man. Jack just wants you
to find another place for it.

185
00:12:02,621 --> 00:12:05,954
He's moving supplies
and says it's in the way.

186
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:14,493
You know, a lot of people
look up to me.

187
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:16,865
- They respect me, and you...
- Charlie. . .

188
00:12:16,936 --> 00:12:19,700
You treat me like a bloody child,
some useless joke.

189
00:12:19,772 --> 00:12:21,899
- What?
- ''Charlie's not good enough.''

190
00:12:21,974 --> 00:12:24,499
- ''Charlie's in the way.''
- Let me look at you.

191
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:27,512
You'll look out for me?
We'll look out for each other.

192
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:29,741
Calm down.
You're not yourself right now.

193
00:12:29,815 --> 00:12:32,579
You don't know me!
l'm a bloody rock god!

194
00:12:32,651 --> 00:12:34,619
[rumbling]

195
00:12:35,821 --> 00:12:37,118
Oh, no.

196
00:12:44,163 --> 00:12:46,154
Oh!

197
00:12:49,835 --> 00:12:52,497
[coughing]

198
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:55,630
Charlie, where's Jack?

199
00:12:59,311 --> 00:13:01,506
Where's Jack?

200
00:13:09,989 --> 00:13:11,889
[Hurley] Jack!

201
00:13:11,957 --> 00:13:15,120
- Jack, can you hear me?
- [Charlie] l don't know what happened.

202
00:13:15,194 --> 00:13:16,752
We were talking and it came down.

203
00:13:16,829 --> 00:13:19,320
- lt happened so fast.
- [Hurley] We gotta get help.

204
00:13:19,398 --> 00:13:23,494
- Go down to the beach and get help!
- Okay, l'm on it.

205
00:13:23,569 --> 00:13:25,127
And make sure you tell Kate!

206
00:13:28,073 --> 00:13:30,132
What we're doing,

207
00:13:30,209 --> 00:13:33,201
chasing some phantom distress signal,

208
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:35,110
what are the odds of this working?

209
00:13:35,181 --> 00:13:38,480
No worse than the odds of us
surviving that plane crash.

210
00:13:38,551 --> 00:13:42,078
- People survive crashes all the time.
- Not like this one.

211
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:45,123
The tail section broke off
when we were still in the air.

212
00:13:45,191 --> 00:13:46,886
Our section cart-wheeled,

213
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:49,826
and yet we escaped
with nothing but a few scrapes.

214
00:13:49,895 --> 00:13:52,022
How do you explain that?

215
00:13:52,097 --> 00:13:53,689
Blind, dumb luck.

216
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:57,733
No one's that lucky.
We shouldn't have survived.

217
00:13:58,771 --> 00:14:01,365
Sorry, Sayid,
but some things just happen.

218
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:04,034
No rhyme, no reason.

219
00:14:04,109 --> 00:14:05,667
[Charlie] Hey!

220
00:14:05,744 --> 00:14:07,609
Hey!

221
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,648
- We need help!
- What's wrong, man?

222
00:14:09,715 --> 00:14:11,649
- lt's Jack. He's trapped.
- What?

223
00:14:11,717 --> 00:14:14,550
- Our cave collapsed. We've got to go.
- Hey, Scott?

224
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:15,848
- l'm Steve.
- l'm Scott.

225
00:14:15,921 --> 00:14:17,855
We got an emergency.
Let's go.

226
00:14:17,923 --> 00:14:20,016
- We gotta go now.
- [Michael] Come on, go.

227
00:14:20,092 --> 00:14:21,992
Come on, let's go.

228
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:25,956
Shannon, you have to be ready
to do something important.

229
00:14:26,031 --> 00:14:29,865
At 5<i>:</i>00 sharp, you need
to be ready to turn that antenna on.

230
00:14:29,935 --> 00:14:33,234
- There's a switch at the base.
- Why?

231
00:14:33,305 --> 00:14:36,138
Kate and Sayid
are triangulating the French signal,

232
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:38,335
but the antenna's power is really weak,

233
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:41,311
so you have to wait until
they fire their bottle rockets.

234
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:44,008
Then you fire this one,
then you turn on the antenna.

235
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:45,812
Got it?

236
00:14:46,518 --> 00:14:49,487
- The switch is where now?
- Did you hear a word l said?

237
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:52,023
- Can you or can't you do it?
- Yeah, l can.

238
00:14:52,091 --> 00:14:53,752
Okay, okay.

239
00:14:56,795 --> 00:14:58,524
Wait. Kate.

240
00:14:58,597 --> 00:15:02,397
- Hey, we have to tell Kate about Jack.
- Sorry, sport, you just missed her.

241
00:15:02,468 --> 00:15:04,698
Her and Muhammad
headed into the woods.

242
00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:06,704
- Which way?
- Don't sweat it, amigo.

243
00:15:06,772 --> 00:15:08,569
- l know which way they went.
- But. . .

244
00:15:08,641 --> 00:15:13,010
l'll tell her. You just keep doing
whatever it is you do around here.

245
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:16,377

All right! All right, all right.

255
00:16:03,762 --> 00:16:06,731
[Liam] Hey, mate.
Thanks for coming in.

00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:10,428
- [chattering]
- [rap music playing]

257
00:16:12,271 --> 00:16:13,602
What the hell was that?

258
00:16:13,672 --> 00:16:16,470
Another kick-ass show.
You were bloody brilliant.

259
00:16:16,542 --> 00:16:18,601
l sing the chorus to <i>You All Everybody.</i>

260
00:16:18,677 --> 00:16:20,338
Oh, yeah.
Sorry about that.

261
00:16:20,412 --> 00:16:23,848
l got caught up in the moment.
Like the crowd wanted it, you know.

262
00:16:23,916 --> 00:16:26,612
l know, but if l start
and then you come in after. . .

263
00:16:26,685 --> 00:16:28,084
She's cool. Let her in.

264
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:31,316
lt won't happen again.
l promise.

265
00:16:32,091 --> 00:16:33,888
Hello, lovely.

266
00:16:44,937 --> 00:16:46,802
Chill, baby brother.

267
00:17:00,719 --> 00:17:03,313
- Hey. Hey, wait!
- Jack's in there.

268
00:17:03,389 --> 00:17:05,857
Let me check it out
before you move things.

269
00:17:05,924 --> 00:17:07,983
- lf it's unstable...
- How do you know?

270
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:11,518
Eight years of construction work.
l don't want you near the rocks.

271
00:17:11,597 --> 00:17:13,827
- Take the dog.
- You should get Mr. Locke.

272
00:17:13,899 --> 00:17:17,062
Locke's in the jungle killing stuff.
Who knows where he is.

273
00:17:21,807 --> 00:17:24,742
All right.
This area here is load bearing.

274
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:27,938
We gotta dig where there's
no danger of the wall buckling in.

275
00:17:32,418 --> 00:17:35,615
All right, here. We dig in here
so the wall doesn't collapse.

276
00:17:35,687 --> 00:17:39,020
Four at a time, by hand,
till we can find some kind of shovel.

277
00:17:39,091 --> 00:17:41,184
We take shifts and go slow.

278
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:43,922
Whoever isn't digging
should be clearing the rocks

279
00:17:43,996 --> 00:17:47,932
and bringing water to who is working.
Okay? Let's move.

280
00:17:50,169 --> 00:17:52,899
[birds calling]

281
00:17:54,706 --> 00:17:56,003
Hey.

282
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:57,940
What the hell are you doing here?

283
00:17:58,010 --> 00:18:00,706
Easy. l just came
to tell you something.

284
00:18:00,779 --> 00:18:04,613
What makes you think l'm interested
in anything you have to say?

285
00:18:13,525 --> 00:18:15,823
You were right about me.

286
00:18:15,894 --> 00:18:19,125
That l don't help anyone but myself.

287
00:18:19,198 --> 00:18:22,361
Well, here l am.
Ready to pitch in.

288
00:18:22,434 --> 00:18:24,595
You're here to help?

289
00:18:25,971 --> 00:18:29,429
Hey, you act any more surprised,
l'm gonna get offended.

290
00:18:29,508 --> 00:18:31,999
[flies buzzing]

291
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:43,845
Something wrong, Charlie?

292
00:18:45,224 --> 00:18:47,920
Yeah. Jack.

293
00:18:47,993 --> 00:18:49,392
He's. . .

294
00:18:49,995 --> 00:18:52,725
There's been an accident
in the caves.

295
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:54,663
Jack's trapped in a cave-in.

296
00:18:56,635 --> 00:19:00,799
- ls anyone trying to get him out?
- There's a bunch of people there now.

297
00:19:00,873 --> 00:19:02,864
And why aren't you with them?

298
00:19:12,384 --> 00:19:14,750
You didn't come to tell me
about Jack, did you?

299
00:19:17,389 --> 00:19:20,017
l want my stash, Locke.

300
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:24,155
l can't stand feeling like this.

301
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:29,858
Come here.
Let me show you something.

302
00:19:37,209 --> 00:19:39,700
What do you suppose
is in that cocoon, Charlie?

303
00:19:41,446 --> 00:19:43,573
l don't know.
A butterfly, l guess.

304
00:19:43,649 --> 00:19:47,517
lt's much more beautiful than that.
That's a moth cocoon.

305
00:19:47,586 --> 00:19:50,214
lt's ironic.
Butterflies get all the attention.

306
00:19:50,289 --> 00:19:52,484
But moths, they spin silk.

307
00:19:52,558 --> 00:19:55,584
- They're stronger, faster...
- That's wonderful, but. . .

308
00:19:55,661 --> 00:19:58,528
You see this little hole?

309
00:19:59,665 --> 00:20:01,690
This moth's just about to emerge.

310
00:20:01,767 --> 00:20:03,758
lt's in there right now, struggling.

311
00:20:03,835 --> 00:20:06,929
lt's digging its way through
the thick hide of the cocoon.

312
00:20:07,005 --> 00:20:10,839
Now, l could help it.

313
00:20:10,909 --> 00:20:14,436
Take my knife,
gently widen the opening,

314
00:20:14,513 --> 00:20:16,174
and the moth would be free.

315
00:20:16,248 --> 00:20:18,978
But it would be too weak to survive.

316
00:20:20,485 --> 00:20:23,784
The struggle is nature's way
of strengthening it.

317
00:20:23,855 --> 00:20:27,450
Now, this is the second time you've
asked me for your drugs back.

318
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:32,890
Ask me again and it's yours.

319
00:20:43,275 --> 00:20:45,675
[man] Keep going. Keep going.

320
00:20:49,748 --> 00:20:52,308
[straining]

321
00:20:56,455 --> 00:20:59,015
We're through.
We got a hole.

322
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:00,581
Jack!

323
00:21:00,659 --> 00:21:02,559
Jack! Can you hear me, Jack?

324
00:21:06,565 --> 00:21:08,260
Come on, dude, answer me.

325
00:21:11,637 --> 00:21:13,696
- [Jack] Oh!
- l hear him!

326
00:21:13,772 --> 00:21:16,138
- He's alive.
- Jack, bro, you okay?

327
00:21:17,809 --> 00:21:19,970
[Jack] l'm pinned. l can't move.

328
00:21:22,681 --> 00:21:24,444
[gasping]

329
00:21:25,017 --> 00:21:27,178
[Jack] l can't move.

330
00:21:28,987 --> 00:21:31,478
What do we do?
How do we get him out?

331
00:21:36,161 --> 00:21:38,891
- Charlie was with me.
- He's okay. He made it out.

332
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:41,159
- Listen, Jack?
- Yeah?

333
00:21:41,233 --> 00:21:43,292
We're gonna get you out of there, okay?

334
00:21:43,368 --> 00:21:45,893
[moaning]

335
00:21:56,081 --> 00:21:58,174
We'll place the second antenna here.

336
00:21:58,250 --> 00:21:59,717
You want to help?

337
00:22:03,689 --> 00:22:07,853
Attach this antenna up in that tree.
As high up as you can.

338
00:22:07,926 --> 00:22:10,394
Golly, thanks, boss.

339
00:22:16,134 --> 00:22:18,659
Five o'clock.
Watch for my flare.

340
00:22:18,737 --> 00:22:20,637
Then it's your turn.

341
00:22:20,706 --> 00:22:22,333
l don't trust him.

342
00:22:23,208 --> 00:22:24,436
Who does?

343
00:22:27,379 --> 00:22:29,813
l don't trust him with you.

344
00:22:30,282 --> 00:22:31,613
l can handle him.

345
00:22:40,459 --> 00:22:43,553
Okay. We can't safely
make that tunnel any bigger.

346
00:22:43,628 --> 00:22:47,496
But since Jack can't get out, one of us
is gonna have to go in and unpin him.

347
00:22:47,566 --> 00:22:50,399
- Crawl through that?
- He means someone smaller.

348
00:22:50,469 --> 00:22:52,164
[speaking in Korean]

349
00:22:52,237 --> 00:22:54,171
Dude, we don't understand Chinese.

350
00:22:54,239 --> 00:22:55,763
Korean, man.

351
00:22:57,275 --> 00:23:00,676
- They're Korean.
- [Charlie] l'll do it.

352
00:23:01,146 --> 00:23:02,773
Charlie?

353
00:23:03,415 --> 00:23:05,383
No, man.
You're still too shook up.

354
00:23:05,450 --> 00:23:07,475
- l might be able to squeeze. . .
- Wait.

355
00:23:07,552 --> 00:23:10,544
Who's gonna take care of your son
if something happens?

356
00:23:12,824 --> 00:23:15,759
She's got a husband.
He's got a sister.

357
00:23:15,827 --> 00:23:18,022
l'm alone here.

358
00:23:18,797 --> 00:23:20,128
No one on the island.

359
00:23:22,834 --> 00:23:24,529
Let me do this.

360
00:23:34,212 --> 00:23:37,113
Still ain't five, just like
the last time you checked.

361
00:23:37,182 --> 00:23:39,309
l don't want to miss
Sayid's signal.

362
00:23:39,384 --> 00:23:41,909
l'll fire the flare,
you set off the antenna.

363
00:23:41,987 --> 00:23:45,616
l just thank the good Lord
l got you here to keep reminding me.

364
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:48,989
lt's a dirty job,
but somebody's gotta do it.

365
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:53,625
So, what is it about that guy?

366
00:23:56,034 --> 00:23:57,729
Jack.

367
00:23:57,803 --> 00:24:02,740
What is it about him that
makes you all weak in the loins?

368
00:24:02,808 --> 00:24:05,641
Do you try to be a pig
or does it just come naturally?

369
00:24:06,945 --> 00:24:11,541
lt's that he's a doctor, right?
Yeah, ladies dig the doctors.

370
00:24:11,616 --> 00:24:14,585
Hell, give me a couple of Band-Aids,
a bottle of peroxide,

371
00:24:14,653 --> 00:24:16,621
l could run this island too.

372
00:24:16,688 --> 00:24:19,384
You're actually comparing yourself
to Jack?

373
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:25,755
The difference between us
ain't that big, sweetheart.

374
00:24:25,831 --> 00:24:29,289
l guarantee you if he had survived
a few more weeks on this island,

375
00:24:29,367 --> 00:24:31,858
you'd have figured that out.

376
00:24:32,571 --> 00:24:34,664
What did you just say?

377
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:41,941
Ah, damn. Didn't l tell you?

378
00:24:42,013 --> 00:24:46,313
Word from the valley is Saint Jack
got himself buried in a cave-in.

379
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:50,654
- What?
- Look at the bright side,

380
00:24:50,722 --> 00:24:53,555
now you have someone else to pity.

381
00:25:03,535 --> 00:25:06,026
[Michael] Listen, man.
Go slow, all right?

382
00:25:06,104 --> 00:25:08,971
Try not to nudge
any of the rocks around you.

383
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:13,136
- Anything else?
- Yeah. Good luck.

384
00:25:13,778 --> 00:25:17,407
- Be safe, man.
- Good luck, Charlie.

385
00:25:17,482 --> 00:25:19,780
All right. Thanks, guys.

386
00:25:41,139 --> 00:25:43,073
<i>[cameras clicking]</i>

387
00:25:43,141 --> 00:25:45,200
<i>[crowd chanting]</i>

388
00:25:45,544 --> 00:25:49,173
[crowd] Drive Shaft! Drive Shaft!
Drive Shaft!

389
00:25:52,517 --> 00:25:55,577
[Liam] Everybody wants a piece.
Everybody wants more.

390
00:25:55,654 --> 00:25:58,555
Everybody wants another piece.

391
00:25:58,623 --> 00:26:01,217
They can't leave you alone
when you're on top...

392
00:26:01,293 --> 00:26:02,590
Bloody hell.

393
00:26:03,962 --> 00:26:08,524
Hey, baby brother.
Grab a bird and sit down.

394
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:12,195
Get out.
You too, get out.

395
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:13,703
- Out!
- Out?

396
00:26:13,772 --> 00:26:15,262
Come on. Now!

397
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:17,467
Come back in five minutes.

398
00:26:22,547 --> 00:26:25,539
Sound check.
You missed sound check.

399
00:26:25,617 --> 00:26:28,643
You don't show up for rehearsal.
We've got a show in an hour.

400
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:31,416
Ooh! A show. l like shows.

401
00:26:33,692 --> 00:26:36,024
Oh, yeah.

402
00:26:37,462 --> 00:26:39,020
All right. That's it.

403
00:26:39,097 --> 00:26:42,294
After tonight,
we cancel the rest of the tour.

404
00:26:42,367 --> 00:26:44,597
- What?
- We walk away.

405
00:26:44,669 --> 00:26:45,897
Are you off your head?

406
00:26:45,971 --> 00:26:47,962
Like we said we would
if things got. . .

407
00:26:48,039 --> 00:26:50,803
Walk away and go where?

408
00:26:51,343 --> 00:26:55,074
You're killing yourself with this junk.
You're destroying Drive Shaft.

409
00:26:55,146 --> 00:26:57,171
l am Drive Shaft!

410
00:26:57,248 --> 00:27:00,775
No one even knows who
the sodding bass player is.

411
00:27:00,852 --> 00:27:03,685
This is it, Charlie.
End of the rainbow.

412
00:27:03,755 --> 00:27:05,814
You really think you can walk away?

413
00:27:06,491 --> 00:27:07,981
Then what, eh?

414
00:27:08,059 --> 00:27:12,189
Face it. lf you're not in this band,
what the bloody hell use are you?

415
00:27:17,035 --> 00:27:19,469
- Liam.
- Piss off!

416
00:28:19,364 --> 00:28:23,164
- [panting]
- [rumbling]

417
00:28:24,269 --> 00:28:25,395
Charlie?

418
00:28:26,137 --> 00:28:27,934
Charlie, move!

419
00:28:28,373 --> 00:28:30,136
Charlie!

420
00:28:50,929 --> 00:28:53,921
[coughing]

421
00:29:00,739 --> 00:29:01,933
l'm, uh...

422
00:29:02,006 --> 00:29:03,200
l'm here to rescue you.

423
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:11,014
- We try again.
- We can't leave them.

424
00:29:11,082 --> 00:29:14,540
- They're gonna run out of air.
- Stop talking. l'm trying to think.

425
00:29:14,619 --> 00:29:15,984
Where is he?

426
00:29:16,054 --> 00:29:17,715
- Where is he?
- [Michael] Kate.

427
00:29:17,789 --> 00:29:20,280
Where is he?
Where's Jack?

428
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:28,232
He's in there.

429
00:29:32,937 --> 00:29:34,802
Does anyone know if he's alive?

430
00:29:36,474 --> 00:29:38,135
- ls he alive?
- We don't know.

431
00:29:38,209 --> 00:29:41,178
Charlie went in there
through a tunnel that we dug.

432
00:29:41,246 --> 00:29:43,441
But it collapsed.

433
00:29:46,084 --> 00:29:47,676
Why is nobody digging?

434
00:29:53,658 --> 00:29:55,216
- [chattering]
- [straining]

435
00:29:55,293 --> 00:29:57,853
Give it to me.
Give it to me.

436
00:29:59,998 --> 00:30:03,434
Okay. One, two...

437
00:30:03,501 --> 00:30:05,662
[straining] ...three!

438
00:30:06,571 --> 00:30:09,904
- Oh!
- Sorry, Jack. Sorry.

439
00:30:09,974 --> 00:30:11,999
You all right?

440
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:16,679
- My shoulder's dislocated.
- What?

441
00:30:18,516 --> 00:30:21,246
- You're gonna have to pop it back in.
- No, l can't.

442
00:30:21,319 --> 00:30:23,184
- l need your help.
- l can't do it.

443
00:30:23,254 --> 00:30:24,482
- Yes, you can.
- l can't.

444
00:30:24,556 --> 00:30:25,648
Yes, you can.

445
00:30:27,192 --> 00:30:28,750
Okay.

446
00:30:28,827 --> 00:30:30,192
What do l... What do l do?

447
00:30:32,664 --> 00:30:35,189
- Take my hand.
- This hand? Okay.

448
00:30:35,266 --> 00:30:37,427
Okay, wait. Okay.

449
00:30:37,502 --> 00:30:42,371
Now, when l tell you to,
pull as hard as you possibly can.

450
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:44,203
[stammering]
l don't know if...

451
00:30:44,275 --> 00:30:45,708
You can do this, Charlie.

452
00:30:47,245 --> 00:30:49,679
Okay, okay, okay.

453
00:30:57,589 --> 00:30:58,578
Now.

454
00:30:59,290 --> 00:31:02,589
[cries out in pain]

455
00:31:05,997 --> 00:31:07,988
[jingling]

456
00:31:28,987 --> 00:31:31,854
Charlie.
What are you doing here?

457
00:31:31,923 --> 00:31:34,357
A bloke can't pay
his big brother a visit?

458
00:31:34,425 --> 00:31:37,519
Of course you can.
Why didn't you call, you lunatic?

459
00:31:37,595 --> 00:31:40,223
What are you doing in Sydney?

460
00:31:40,298 --> 00:31:41,856
lt's all lined up, Liam.

461
00:31:41,933 --> 00:31:46,165
Eight weeks on tour, opening
for some band called Meat Coat.

462
00:31:47,639 --> 00:31:50,369
First gig's in Los Angeles.

463
00:31:51,142 --> 00:31:53,440
LA, Liam.

464
00:31:53,912 --> 00:31:57,211
This is a chance
to get back on a label.

465
00:31:57,282 --> 00:31:59,273
A real one.

466
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:02,716
This is our comeback.

467
00:32:03,588 --> 00:32:06,989
Charlie, l don't want to come back.

468
00:32:08,893 --> 00:32:11,521
Yeah. Right. Well...

469
00:32:11,596 --> 00:32:13,894
Here's the thing.

470
00:32:13,965 --> 00:32:18,265
They won't book Drive Shaft
without you.

471
00:32:20,772 --> 00:32:23,240
So, l'm asking. . .

472
00:32:23,308 --> 00:32:25,208
...as a brother. . .

473
00:32:26,778 --> 00:32:28,336
...the way you asked me.

474
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:32,838
You were with me the night
l missed Megan's birth.

475
00:32:32,917 --> 00:32:37,217
You were the one l was stumbling around
Dresden with trying to find a fix.

476
00:32:43,928 --> 00:32:47,091
- You're still using, aren't you?
- Don't change the subject.

477
00:32:47,165 --> 00:32:49,429
That's why you haven't
returned my calls.

478
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:52,060
- You gonna do this tour?
- You said you'd get help.

479
00:32:52,136 --> 00:32:53,160
l lost your number.

480
00:32:53,237 --> 00:32:55,933
- You're still a junkie.
- You did this to me!

481
00:32:56,007 --> 00:32:58,134
lt was about the music.

482
00:33:01,813 --> 00:33:03,508
Music, Liam.

483
00:33:05,616 --> 00:33:07,208
You took that away from me.

484
00:33:08,086 --> 00:33:09,485
Listen.

485
00:33:10,121 --> 00:33:12,316
Why don't you stay with us
for a few weeks?

486
00:33:12,390 --> 00:33:14,290
Karen and me,
we can get you help.

487
00:33:14,359 --> 00:33:17,760
- Sydney's got really good programs. . .
- Forget it.

488
00:33:17,829 --> 00:33:19,160
Don't go.

489
00:33:19,230 --> 00:33:21,664
- Thanks for your help.
- Stay. Please.

490
00:33:21,733 --> 00:33:25,863
- l was just looking out for you.
- You never looked out for me.

491
00:33:26,404 --> 00:33:29,237
[dog barking]

492
00:33:29,307 --> 00:33:31,707
l have a plane to catch.

493
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:44,347
How long has it been?

494
00:33:45,089 --> 00:33:47,182
l don't know what
you're going on about.

495
00:33:47,258 --> 00:33:48,885
How long since your last fix?

496
00:33:50,895 --> 00:33:53,159
[sighs]

497
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:57,224
Almost a day and a half.

498
00:33:57,835 --> 00:34:02,431
How's the withdrawal treating you?
Any hallucinations?

499
00:34:02,507 --> 00:34:06,273
Apart from the conversation l had with
you about an hour ago in the jungle.

500
00:34:06,344 --> 00:34:07,709
No, not really.

501
00:34:09,514 --> 00:34:14,042
Why didn't you say anything?
l could've helped you through this.

502
00:34:14,752 --> 00:34:18,085
Yeah. You thinking l'm useless
and a junkie to boot.

503
00:34:18,156 --> 00:34:21,557
Useless? You're not useless.

504
00:34:21,626 --> 00:34:24,925
That took a lot of guts getting in here
and trying to rescue me.

505
00:34:25,897 --> 00:34:27,762
l won't forget that.

506
00:34:27,832 --> 00:34:30,460
For the rest of our lives?

507
00:34:34,505 --> 00:34:39,306
At the rate we're using our oxygen
in here, that won't be too long.

508
00:34:41,813 --> 00:34:45,271
This place reminds me of confession.

509
00:34:45,349 --> 00:34:49,308
Those little claustrophobic booths.

510
00:34:49,921 --> 00:34:53,379
l wouldn't have taken you
for a religious man.

511
00:34:53,858 --> 00:34:56,019
l used to be.

512
00:34:56,394 --> 00:34:58,862
You want to hear my confession?

513
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:00,921
lt might take a while.

514
00:35:01,332 --> 00:35:02,765
Hey, l'm no saint, either.

515
00:35:04,635 --> 00:35:07,069

516
00:35:07,138 --> 00:35:08,605
What's wrong?

517
00:35:09,373 --> 00:35:12,035
- lt's a moth.
- A what?

518
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:15,568
Right behind you.
There's a bloody moth in here.

519
00:35:15,646 --> 00:35:16,635
Look.

520
00:35:19,584 --> 00:35:21,449
Charlie, what are you doing?

521
00:35:38,035 --> 00:35:39,662
Kate, you need to take a break.

522
00:35:41,806 --> 00:35:42,966
l'm fine.

523
00:35:46,844 --> 00:35:48,744
We've got enough people to dig.

524
00:35:48,813 --> 00:35:51,782
You keep going at this pace,
you're gonna kill yourself.

525
00:35:56,087 --> 00:35:57,850
There's light.

526
00:35:58,256 --> 00:36:00,656
- What?
- l can see light.

527
00:36:09,834 --> 00:36:12,302
[straining]

528
00:36:16,874 --> 00:36:21,072
[grunting, rocks falling]

529
00:36:34,358 --> 00:36:37,521
- [dog barking]
- Hey, it's the doctor!

530
00:36:52,543 --> 00:36:55,034
Oh! Ow! Easy.

531
00:36:55,112 --> 00:36:58,570
[chuckling] My shoulder, careful.

532
00:36:58,649 --> 00:37:00,913
- How did you get out?
- Charlie.

533
00:37:00,985 --> 00:37:03,579
- Charlie found a way out.
- Dude, you rock.

534
00:37:06,991 --> 00:37:09,221
You okay?

535
00:37:09,927 --> 00:37:11,724
[chuckling]

536
00:37:16,067 --> 00:37:17,694
- [man] Nice work.
- You did it.

537
00:37:17,768 --> 00:37:20,032
Thanks. Thank you.

538
00:37:26,978 --> 00:37:29,208
[whispers prayer]

539
00:37:39,323 --> 00:37:41,848
All right, everyone.
Now it's your turn.

540
00:37:41,926 --> 00:37:44,451
- We're in Malibu part of the year,
- [explosion]

541
00:37:44,528 --> 00:37:47,122
but the guys there are such idiots...

542
00:37:50,301 --> 00:37:52,531
Damn it.

543
00:37:52,603 --> 00:37:54,833
Damn it. Damn it. Damn it.

544
00:38:06,217 --> 00:38:08,913
Come on, Kate. Come on.
One more. One more.

545
00:38:08,986 --> 00:38:11,454
Come on, Kate.
Come on.

546
00:38:14,892 --> 00:38:17,918
Yes. Yes.

547
00:38:26,737 --> 00:38:28,432
Where are you?

548
00:38:28,506 --> 00:38:30,167
[static]

549
00:38:30,241 --> 00:38:32,300
Yes!

550
00:38:34,078 --> 00:38:36,672
Where are you?
Where are you?

551
00:38:56,667 --> 00:38:58,601
Dude, you feeling okay?

552
00:38:58,669 --> 00:39:00,466
- You look a little...
- Flu.

553
00:39:00,538 --> 00:39:03,006
- He's got the flu.
- Oh, man, that's rough.

554
00:39:03,074 --> 00:39:05,804
After all you've been through.
Take it easy, man.

555
00:39:26,564 --> 00:39:29,658
l think l'm gonna stretch my legs.

556
00:39:32,503 --> 00:39:35,404
[straining]

557
00:39:43,647 --> 00:39:46,081
This place is cool.
Can we live here?

558
00:40:02,733 --> 00:40:04,200
Made you something.

559
00:40:04,268 --> 00:40:07,704
Aw. My very first sling.

560
00:40:08,439 --> 00:40:10,634
How's that?

561
00:40:10,708 --> 00:40:12,642
Good.

562
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:14,673
Thank you.

563
00:40:16,046 --> 00:40:20,039
So these are the safe caves
you've been going on about.

564
00:40:20,117 --> 00:40:21,584
This was a fluke.

565
00:40:21,652 --> 00:40:25,918
Michael checked out the integrity
of the rest, gave them an okay.

566
00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:31,854
- You're headed back to the beach, huh?
- Sayid should be back by now,

567
00:40:31,929 --> 00:40:33,556
and if his plan worked, then...

568
00:40:33,631 --> 00:40:36,657
Then we're one step closer
to getting off this island.

569
00:40:46,744 --> 00:40:48,712
Thanks for the sling, Kate.

570
00:40:49,914 --> 00:40:52,109
You're welcome.

571
00:41:13,003 --> 00:41:15,733
Give them to me.

572
00:41:18,843 --> 00:41:20,834
This is the third time.

573
00:41:20,911 --> 00:41:24,938
- Are you sure you really want it?
- l've made my choice.

574
00:41:56,013 --> 00:41:57,913
l'm proud of you, Charlie.

575
00:42:01,852 --> 00:42:03,410
l always knew you could do it.
