Lost...

2
00:00:01,729 --> 00:00:03,429
I think Michael has been compromised.

3
00:00:03,507 --> 00:00:05,168
This camp Michael is leading you to--

4
00:00:05,266 --> 00:00:06,908
that is where they will set their trap.

5
00:00:06,986 --> 00:00:09,002
- And I can go ashore undetected.
- How?

6
00:00:09,074 --> 00:00:10,794
We will sail the boat and scout them.

7
00:00:11,205 --> 00:00:13,276
This time they will know
that we are coming.

8
00:00:19,333 --> 00:00:20,330
Hi, Jack.

9
00:00:20,388 --> 00:00:22,226
- I'm Juliet.
- Where are my friends?

10
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:26,077
Tell me where my friends are!

11
00:02:32,317 --> 00:02:34,177
My husband says it's time to leave.

12
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:38,106
He doesn't think Jack
and the others are coming.

13
00:02:38,418 --> 00:02:40,549
It's been over a day
since we lit the fire.

14
00:02:41,474 --> 00:02:42,764
They should be here by now.

15
00:02:42,901 --> 00:02:44,288
Jack knows we're out here.

16
00:02:44,718 --> 00:02:46,419
He's counting on our signal.

17
00:02:54,621 --> 00:02:56,536
Perhaps he's not able to see the smoke.

18
00:02:56,818 --> 00:02:59,319
If he's north of us,
the mountains would block his view.

19
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,899
We need to sail forward along the coast,

20
00:03:01,987 --> 00:03:04,293
Clear the mountains
and start another signal fire.

21
00:03:11,215 --> 00:03:12,915
I told Jack I would light a fire.

22
00:03:13,345 --> 00:03:14,654
I'm not abandoning him.

23
00:03:31,791 --> 00:03:33,941
My husband thinks
we have to do as he says,

24
00:03:34,492 --> 00:03:36,818
Because he's the only one
who knows how to sail.

25
00:03:38,943 --> 00:03:40,175
But he's wrong.

26
00:03:43,578 --> 00:03:44,985
I can help you sail the boat.

27
00:04:06,577 --> 00:04:07,828
Are you feeling any better?

28
00:04:14,271 --> 00:04:15,640
I made the soup myself,

29
00:04:16,865 --> 00:04:19,348
but I won't take it the wrong way
if you don't like it.

30
00:04:52,631 --> 00:04:54,019
You never made soup for me.

31
00:04:59,848 --> 00:05:01,314
Am I interrupting something?

32
00:05:01,392 --> 00:05:03,171
Would it really matter if you were?

33
00:05:05,662 --> 00:05:06,991
We have a situation.

34
00:05:07,675 --> 00:05:10,685
Brian radioed in.
The Iraqi found the decoy village.

35
00:05:10,879 --> 00:05:12,501
Good. It's what we wanted.

36
00:05:12,657 --> 00:05:14,514
Brian followed him back to the shore.

37
00:05:14,886 --> 00:05:16,411
Ben, they have a sailboat.

38
00:05:16,841 --> 00:05:18,810
- How?
- I have no idea.

39
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:20,882
So they have a boat.

40
00:05:20,999 --> 00:05:22,719
Sailing in circles will keep them busy.

41
00:05:22,777 --> 00:05:23,969
They could find us.

42
00:05:29,017 --> 00:05:30,251
- Ben...
- I'm thinking.

43
00:05:33,131 --> 00:05:34,754
How quickly can you put together a team?

44
00:05:34,812 --> 00:05:37,384
- Within the hour.
- Then don't waste time talking to us.

45
00:05:42,597 --> 00:05:43,643
Hey, Colleen.

46
00:05:45,917 --> 00:05:47,024
I want that boat.

3x02 - The Glass Ballerina

50
00:06:17,138 --> 00:06:18,291
Nice alarm clock.

51
00:06:18,818 --> 00:06:20,401
I've woken up to worse.

52
00:06:21,679 --> 00:06:23,262
You want half a fish biscuit?

53
00:06:43,482 --> 00:06:44,539
- What's this?
- Lunch.

54
00:06:44,601 --> 00:06:46,476
We're gonna need you
to keep up your strength.

55
00:06:46,534 --> 00:06:47,903
Is that right?

56
00:06:56,146 --> 00:06:57,871
- Danny, wait.
- Hold up.

57
00:06:58,692 --> 00:06:59,912
They have a boat.

58
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:03,070
<i>Ben wants us to take the galaga</i>

59
00:07:03,207 --> 00:07:04,223
<i>and retrieve...</i>

60
00:07:04,262 --> 00:07:06,177
Okay. Be careful out there.

61
00:07:13,893 --> 00:07:15,105
What are you looking at?

62
00:08:32,096 --> 00:08:33,289
What's wrong?

63
00:08:37,293 --> 00:08:38,804
What's wrong is I'm married.

64
00:08:40,166 --> 00:08:41,065
Right.

65
00:08:42,077 --> 00:08:43,137
That.

66
00:09:29,245 --> 00:09:31,101
I don't want to share you anymore.

67
00:09:34,617 --> 00:09:36,014
Your english is excellent now.

68
00:09:36,371 --> 00:09:37,721
We can go to america.

69
00:09:42,957 --> 00:09:44,619
- Does anyone know you're...
- No.

70
00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:40,779
All right, here's the jig.

71
00:10:41,066 --> 00:10:43,763
See these rocks here? That's where you two come in.

72
00:10:44,767 --> 00:10:46,194
You're gonna chop 'em loose,

73
00:10:46,551 --> 00:10:48,174
and you're gonna haul 'em outta here.

74
00:10:48,291 --> 00:10:49,952
You expect me to work in this dress?

75
00:10:50,030 --> 00:10:51,222
It's up to you.

76
00:10:51,907 --> 00:10:53,471
You can take it off if you want.

77
00:11:00,712 --> 00:11:01,891
How dare you?

78
00:11:02,849 --> 00:11:05,214
Now if you need anything,
you raise your hand.

79
00:11:05,771 --> 00:11:08,195
- You get ten minutes for lunch--
- I got a question, boss.

80
00:11:08,253 --> 00:11:10,142
- No questions.
- She got to ask a question.

81
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:13,671
If you try to run off,
you will be shocked.

82
00:11:13,866 --> 00:11:16,063
Shot? Don't we even get a warning?

83
00:11:16,121 --> 00:11:17,486
Shocked. I said shocked.

84
00:11:17,528 --> 00:11:19,359
If you talk to each other,
you'll be shocked.

85
00:11:19,385 --> 00:11:21,014
You touch each other,
you'll be shocked.

86
00:11:21,025 --> 00:11:22,834
If you're slacking,
you're gonna get shocked.

87
00:11:22,869 --> 00:11:25,240
Matter of fact, you do anything at all
that pisses me off,

88
00:11:25,357 --> 00:11:26,784
you're gonna get shocked.

89
00:11:27,175 --> 00:11:29,129
Okay? Let's get to work.

90
00:11:29,224 --> 00:11:31,354
I'm not doing anything until I see Jack.

91
00:11:41,841 --> 00:11:43,482
Now that was a quarter charge.

92
00:11:43,834 --> 00:11:45,300
You got any more questions?

93
00:11:55,711 --> 00:11:57,050
Soon as you're able to walk,

94
00:11:57,919 --> 00:11:59,198
wheelbarrow's right over there.

95
00:14:31,277 --> 00:14:33,798
Why should there be a dock
all the way out here?

96
00:14:36,068 --> 00:14:37,221
Others.

97
00:14:37,944 --> 00:14:40,133
The dock's decaying. It's overgrown.

98
00:14:40,531 --> 00:14:42,798
It looks like it hasn't been used
in quite some time.

99
00:14:43,092 --> 00:14:44,792
Whoever built it, they're not here now.

100
00:14:46,307 --> 00:14:48,613
Let's bring the boat in.
We'll tie to the dock

101
00:14:48,652 --> 00:14:51,178
and build a fire on the beach.
The visibility's excellent,

102
00:14:52,409 --> 00:14:54,872
And Jack will be able to see us
from miles around.

103
00:15:00,373 --> 00:15:01,383
Safe?

104
00:15:02,252 --> 00:15:04,608
Yes, Jin. Of course it's safe.

105
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:33,508
Get back to work.

106
00:15:38,808 --> 00:15:40,234
Whatever you say, boss.

107
00:16:00,732 --> 00:16:01,944
Careful.

108
00:16:02,257 --> 00:16:04,036
Don't let them see you talking to me.

109
00:16:08,482 --> 00:16:10,045
Are they keeping you in the cages?

110
00:16:11,785 --> 00:16:13,621
Did you see another guy
in there with you?

111
00:16:14,023 --> 00:16:15,586
About my age, named Karl?

112
00:16:16,094 --> 00:16:18,772
No. It's just Sawyer and me.

113
00:16:20,388 --> 00:16:22,440
You're not even supposed
to be in that cage.

114
00:16:24,072 --> 00:16:25,499
What are you talking about?

115
00:16:26,261 --> 00:16:27,277
Who are you?

116
00:16:29,865 --> 00:16:31,311
Where'd you get that dress?

117
00:16:33,789 --> 00:16:34,903
They gave it to me.

118
00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:36,768
It's mine.

119
00:16:38,382 --> 00:16:39,496
You can keep it.

120
00:16:40,747 --> 00:16:42,310
It looks better on you anyway.

121
00:16:42,939 --> 00:16:44,073
Wait. Wait.

122
00:16:47,238 --> 00:16:48,704
Having fun yet, freckles?

123
00:16:49,325 --> 00:16:50,732
Quit staring at my ass.

124
00:16:52,706 --> 00:16:54,778
Give me something else to stare at.

125
00:16:58,426 --> 00:16:59,423
Shut up!

126
00:17:01,914 --> 00:17:03,087
Yes, sir, boss.

127
00:17:13,017 --> 00:17:14,229
Thank you.

128
00:17:17,090 --> 00:17:18,282
What else can I do?

129
00:17:18,341 --> 00:17:21,077
Help your husband.
We need as much wood as we can find.

130
00:17:23,686 --> 00:17:25,699
We're building quite a large fire.

131
00:17:26,305 --> 00:17:28,611
We have to make sure
Jack will see the smoke.

132
00:17:34,078 --> 00:17:35,954
Why are you lying to me, Sayid?

133
00:17:38,142 --> 00:17:40,468
And what would you know
about lying, Sun?

134
00:17:45,935 --> 00:17:47,850
You're putting our lives in danger.

135
00:17:52,764 --> 00:17:54,894
I'm fairly certain
our friends have been captured.

136
00:17:56,475 --> 00:17:58,195
There are tracks all over the dock.

137
00:17:59,993 --> 00:18:02,339
They're fresh, as recent as yesterday.

138
00:18:02,398 --> 00:18:03,961
You said this dock was abandoned.

139
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:07,098
That would be part
of the lying you mentioned.

140
00:18:11,516 --> 00:18:13,747
You're not building
this fire for our people.

141
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:16,053
You're building it for the others.

142
00:18:17,496 --> 00:18:19,411
I suspect that when they see the smoke,

143
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:22,030
they'll send
a scout party to investigate.

144
00:18:22,284 --> 00:18:23,886
By then it will be night.

145
00:18:24,238 --> 00:18:25,978
When they arrive, I'll ambush them.

146
00:18:26,525 --> 00:18:27,951
I'll take two of them hostage,

147
00:18:28,362 --> 00:18:29,935
- and I'll kill the rest.
- Two?

148
00:18:31,401 --> 00:18:33,003
One to make the other cooperate.

149
00:18:40,736 --> 00:18:41,882
What do you need me to do?

150
00:18:41,917 --> 00:18:43,667
I'm sorry,
but I'm going to have to ask you

151
00:18:43,702 --> 00:18:45,646
to lie to Jin for another 20 minutes.

152
00:18:51,128 --> 00:18:52,222
Why?

153
00:18:52,457 --> 00:18:54,177
Because once the fire is lit,

154
00:18:54,314 --> 00:18:56,248
it will be too late to go back.

155
00:21:43,712 --> 00:21:44,729
Gun.

156
00:21:47,484 --> 00:21:48,794
I don't think I understand.

157
00:22:04,318 --> 00:22:05,608
What is it?

158
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:07,328
He knows what we're doing.

159
00:22:08,207 --> 00:22:09,497
He knows it's a trap.

160
00:22:19,787 --> 00:22:21,643
He says he understands english

161
00:22:22,227 --> 00:22:23,771
etter than I think he does.

162
00:22:29,612 --> 00:22:31,058
He knows I betrayed him.

163
00:22:33,729 --> 00:22:34,725
Gun.

164
00:22:37,684 --> 00:22:40,538
Can you handle one of these?
It's an automatic--

165
00:22:56,970 --> 00:23:00,098
I think you'll be safer on the boat.

166
00:23:09,058 --> 00:23:10,895
If by chance they get past us,

167
00:23:11,071 --> 00:23:12,439
there's another gun.

168
00:23:12,884 --> 00:23:15,386
It's inside the blue tarp
beneath the galley counter.

169
00:23:15,835 --> 00:23:17,086
If they get past you,

170
00:23:18,464 --> 00:23:20,457
that means my husband is dead...

171
00:23:22,451 --> 00:23:23,889
and I won't care anymore.

172
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:27,195
As I said,

173
00:23:27,610 --> 00:23:29,701
lhe gun is inside the tarp.

174
00:25:00,895 --> 00:25:02,576
- Back off!
- James.

175
00:25:06,188 --> 00:25:07,257
Put the gun down...

176
00:25:07,667 --> 00:25:08,642
right now.

177
00:25:13,072 --> 00:25:13,977
Put the gun down.

178
00:29:20,667 --> 00:29:21,941
I don't think they're coming.

179
00:29:56,245 --> 00:29:57,887
I want you to let me off this boat.

180
00:29:59,993 --> 00:30:01,107
I can't do that.

181
00:30:03,061 --> 00:30:05,467
- Why not?
- That's not my decision to make.

182
00:30:09,005 --> 00:30:11,057
You realize there are five
of my friends up there--

183
00:30:11,116 --> 00:30:12,350
Lower your voice.

184
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:21,384
- I'll shoot.
- No, you won't, Sun.

185
00:30:23,694 --> 00:30:25,542
I know you, Sun-Hwa Kwon.

186
00:30:26,034 --> 00:30:28,160
And I know you're not a killer.

187
00:30:29,914 --> 00:30:31,707
Despite what you may think,

188
00:30:32,762 --> 00:30:33,962
I am not the enemy.

189
00:30:34,767 --> 00:30:36,203
We are not the enemy.

190
00:30:37,928 --> 00:30:39,238
But if you shoot me...

191
00:30:41,481 --> 00:30:43,508
that's exactly what we'll become.

192
00:30:45,998 --> 00:30:47,460
I will. I'll shoot you.

193
00:31:09,721 --> 00:31:10,600
Sun!

194
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:26,153
I'm sorry I dragged you into this.

195
00:34:27,620 --> 00:34:29,945
And please communicate to your husband,

196
00:34:30,512 --> 00:34:33,018
the next time, I will listen to him.

197
00:34:34,845 --> 00:34:36,172
We should go.

198
00:34:36,523 --> 00:34:38,103
We have a long walk ahead of us.

199
00:35:13,067 --> 00:35:14,156
You okay?

200
00:35:14,942 --> 00:35:16,363
Never better.

201
00:35:20,767 --> 00:35:22,581
What the hell were you thinking?

202
00:35:22,691 --> 00:35:24,056
I couldn't help myself.

203
00:35:25,705 --> 00:35:28,629
You just looked so damn cute
swinging that pickax.

204
00:35:30,867 --> 00:35:32,812
Chain gang looks good on you, freckles.

205
00:35:32,895 --> 00:35:33,634
Sawyer.

206
00:35:44,551 --> 00:35:46,551
Two of those guards
got some real fight in 'em.

207
00:35:46,648 --> 00:35:48,731
Rest of 'em,
I ain't that much worried about.

208
00:35:49,676 --> 00:35:53,145
That heavyset guy
packs a hell of a punch.

209
00:35:54,359 --> 00:35:56,977
Shaggy-Haired kid's got
some sort of martial arts training,

210
00:35:57,019 --> 00:35:59,255
but I think
I could take him if I had to.

211
00:35:59,333 --> 00:36:03,557
Oh, and F.Y.I.,
those zapper things got a safety on 'em.

212
00:36:04,802 --> 00:36:09,009
Did you see the look on their faces
when you got a hold of that rifle?

213
00:36:15,619 --> 00:36:19,191
I'm guessin' most of these boys
never seen any real action.

214
00:36:19,398 --> 00:36:21,997
But that blonde
who had a gun to your head...

215
00:36:23,081 --> 00:36:25,716
she woulda shot you, no problem.

216
00:36:27,653 --> 00:36:29,143
Why'd she call you James?

217
00:36:34,926 --> 00:36:36,250
'Cause that's my name.

218
00:36:39,147 --> 00:36:40,945
I noticed somethin' else, too.

219
00:36:43,114 --> 00:36:44,697
You taste like strawberries.

220
00:36:48,246 --> 00:36:49,849
You taste like fish biscuits.

221
00:36:59,744 --> 00:37:01,171
So what do we do now?

222
00:37:02,167 --> 00:37:03,360
Well, shortcake...

223
00:37:05,421 --> 00:37:07,727
now we wait for these bastards
to make a mistake.

224
00:37:09,784 --> 00:37:12,533
<i>Sooner or later,
they're gonna let their guard down.</i>

225
00:37:12,929 --> 00:37:14,258
<i>And when they do,</i>

226
00:37:15,253 --> 00:37:17,637
<i>we're gonna be there
to put 'em in their place.</i>

227
00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:31,533
Hello, Jack.

228
00:37:48,383 --> 00:37:49,692
You know what's crazy Jack?

229
00:37:51,002 --> 00:37:53,944
A week ago, you and I
were in exactly the opposite situation.

230
00:37:55,251 --> 00:37:58,194
I was the one locked up, and
you were the one coming in for visits.

231
00:38:04,032 --> 00:38:06,631
And I know that you were angry,

232
00:38:07,544 --> 00:38:09,753
that I lied to you
about who I was, but...

233
00:38:11,435 --> 00:38:14,093
Hell ! Do you blame me?

234
00:38:15,602 --> 00:38:16,618
I mean, let's face it.

235
00:38:16,677 --> 00:38:18,709
If I'd have told you
I was one of those people,

236
00:38:19,139 --> 00:38:22,695
that you and your friends have been
calling "others" all this time,

237
00:38:24,082 --> 00:38:26,349
it would've been right back
to Sayid and his...

238
00:38:27,963 --> 00:38:29,018
fists.

239
00:38:31,003 --> 00:38:32,078
Wouldn't it?

240
00:38:33,290 --> 00:38:34,648
What do you want from me?

241
00:38:39,161 --> 00:38:41,057
I want for you to change your...

242
00:38:41,604 --> 00:38:42,699
perspective.

243
00:38:44,610 --> 00:38:46,114
And the first step in doing that
would be for me to...

244
00:38:48,395 --> 00:38:50,702
be decent enough
to introduce myself honestly, so...

245
00:38:59,290 --> 00:39:00,307
Hi.

246
00:39:03,398 --> 00:39:05,215
My name is Benjamin Linus,

247
00:39:06,067 --> 00:39:08,246
and I've lived
on this island all my life.

248
00:39:19,309 --> 00:39:20,677
You're not gonna shake?

249
00:39:32,477 --> 00:39:33,786
Bring it in, please.

250
00:39:37,939 --> 00:39:39,639
Where are Kate and Sawyer?

251
00:39:39,690 --> 00:39:41,547
They're fine, and they're close.

252
00:39:41,631 --> 00:39:43,429
That's all I'm able
to tell you right now.

253
00:39:43,710 --> 00:39:45,469
You can tell me anything you want.

254
00:39:45,818 --> 00:39:46,932
Fair enough.

255
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:50,920
It's all I want to tell you.

256
00:39:53,534 --> 00:39:55,374
I'm gonna make this really simple, Jack.

257
00:39:56,879 --> 00:39:58,295
If you cooperate,

258
00:39:59,019 --> 00:40:00,429
we send you home.

259
00:40:03,134 --> 00:40:04,170
Cooperate with what?

260
00:40:04,209 --> 00:40:06,622
- When the time is right, I'll tell you.
- You tell me now.

261
00:40:06,642 --> 00:40:08,069
Patience, Jack.

262
00:40:09,183 --> 00:40:10,850
- Patience.
- Home.

263
00:40:11,885 --> 00:40:14,406
Is that where you sent Walt and Michael?

264
00:40:15,271 --> 00:40:16,366
Yes.

265
00:40:22,299 --> 00:40:23,988
If you could leave this island,

266
00:40:24,105 --> 00:40:25,404
why would you still be here?

267
00:40:25,462 --> 00:40:27,300
Yes, Jack. Why would we be here?

268
00:40:30,242 --> 00:40:31,610
You're lying.

269
00:40:31,815 --> 00:40:34,043
You're stuck here just like we are.
You dont have any...

270
00:40:34,101 --> 00:40:37,165
Your flight crashed
on september 22, 2004.

271
00:40:37,667 --> 00:40:39,027
Today is november 29th.

272
00:40:39,086 --> 00:40:41,744
That means you've been
on our island for 69 days.

273
00:40:41,822 --> 00:40:44,548
And, yes, we do have contact
with the outside world, Jack.

274
00:40:44,782 --> 00:40:46,932
That's how we know
that during those 69 days,

275
00:40:46,991 --> 00:40:49,806
your fellow americans
reelected George W. Bush,

276
00:40:50,509 --> 00:40:52,561
Christopher Reeve has passed away,

277
00:40:53,630 --> 00:40:56,269
Boston Red Sox won the world series.

278
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:03,197
What?

279
00:41:03,294 --> 00:41:05,978
If you wanted me to believe this,

280
00:41:06,154 --> 00:41:09,240
you probably should've picked
somebody else besides the Red Sox.

281
00:41:09,279 --> 00:41:11,073
No, they were down three games to none

282
00:41:11,131 --> 00:41:13,027
against the Yankees
in the league championship,

283
00:41:13,065 --> 00:41:14,755
and then they won eight straight.

284
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:16,965
Sure, sure. Of course they did.

285
00:41:28,419 --> 00:41:29,963
<i>back to Foulke.</i>

286
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:32,641
<i>Red Sox fans have longed to hear it.</i>

287
00:41:32,719 --> 00:41:36,516
<i>The Boston Red Sox are world champions!</i>

288
00:41:39,250 --> 00:41:41,930
<i>A clean sweep of the St Louis Cardinals,</i>

289
00:41:41,950 --> 00:41:46,870
<i>and the Red Sox celebrate in the middle
of the diamond here at Busch stadium.</i>

290
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:58,170
That's home, Jack, right there
on the other side of that glass.

291
00:41:58,590 --> 00:42:01,680
And if you listen to me,
if you trust me,

292
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:06,920
if you do what I tell you when
the time comes, I'll take you there.

293
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:09,870
I will take you home.
