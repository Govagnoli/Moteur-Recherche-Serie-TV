00:00:01,166 --> 00:00:02,610
<i>Previously, on</i> Lost...

2
00:00:02,668 --> 00:00:04,209
You brought me here to operate on you.

3
00:00:04,228 --> 00:00:06,405
You think, I trust you,
that I am gonna just...

4
00:00:06,463 --> 00:00:09,294
do the surgery and hope
that you let me go?

5
00:00:11,305 --> 00:00:12,305
You have to do it.

6
00:00:12,845 --> 00:00:14,656
- How did they get you to ask me?
- Please--

7
00:00:14,675 --> 00:00:16,176
- What did they offer you?
- Nothing.

8
00:00:16,214 --> 00:00:18,962
- Then what are you doing here?
- They're gonna kill Sawyer...

9
00:00:25,475 --> 00:00:27,016
Tomorrow morning, first thing,

10
00:00:27,226 --> 00:00:29,450
we'll get it out,
and they'll keep you alive.

11
00:00:32,137 --> 00:00:33,232
I'm ready.

12
00:00:36,091 --> 00:00:37,294
Sawyer, please!

13
00:00:37,346 --> 00:00:39,088
You get your hands off of him!

14
00:00:41,654 --> 00:00:44,013
I just made a small incision
in Ben's kidney sac.

15
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:47,884
Now if I don't stitch that back up
in the next hour, he's dead.

16
00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:50,787
Now get in here,
and bring that walkie-talkie.

17
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:56,986
3x07 - Not In Portland

18
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:25,207
I fell asleep.

19
00:02:25,605 --> 00:02:27,675
With candles burning-- that's real safe.

20
00:02:34,117 --> 00:02:36,006
We don't have to keep doing this,
you know.

21
00:02:36,671 --> 00:02:39,473
Are you saying that
because you don't think it's gonna work

22
00:02:40,439 --> 00:02:42,374
or because you're afraid he'll find out?

23
00:02:46,899 --> 00:02:47,899
Lift up your shirt.

24
00:03:09,682 --> 00:03:10,750
Some doctor you are.

25
00:03:10,905 --> 00:03:12,416
I'm not doing this as your doctor.

26
00:03:12,455 --> 00:03:13,870
I'm doing it as your sister.

27
00:03:17,111 --> 00:03:18,892
I don't like you being here alone.

28
00:03:19,164 --> 00:03:20,329
Come stay with me.

29
00:03:20,872 --> 00:03:22,653
I like living on the beach.

30
00:03:23,971 --> 00:03:26,022
This is Miami, Rachel.

31
00:03:27,177 --> 00:03:28,496
Everything's on the beach.

32
00:03:35,492 --> 00:03:37,938
You have about an hour head start
before they come after you.

33
00:03:37,977 --> 00:03:39,787
Take the walkie, take Sawyer and go.

34
00:03:39,825 --> 00:03:41,184
<i>Wait. Where are you?<I/>

35
00:03:41,261 --> 00:03:42,946
Kate, listen to me. Just listen to me.

36
00:03:43,178 --> 00:03:44,886
You remember
what I told you on the beach?

37
00:03:44,905 --> 00:03:47,832
Do you rember what story I told you
when you were stitching me up?

38
00:03:49,206 --> 00:03:50,206
Do you rember it?!

39
00:03:50,259 --> 00:03:51,732
Yes, yes, I remember!

40
00:03:53,562 --> 00:03:57,308
When you get safe, you radio me
and you tell me that story.

41
00:03:57,464 --> 00:03:58,475
<i>Jack, please--</i>

42
00:03:58,476 --> 00:04:00,474
If I don't get a call from you
in the next hour,

43
00:04:00,512 --> 00:04:02,534
I'm gonna know something went wrong,
and he dies!

44
00:04:02,644 --> 00:04:04,213
<i>I can't leave without you.</i>

45
00:04:04,242 --> 00:04:05,242
Yes, you are. Go.

46
00:04:05,304 --> 00:04:07,412
- Jack, I can't!
- Go, now.

47
00:04:07,492 --> 00:04:08,512
I can't!

48
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:10,547
Kate, damn it, run!

49
00:04:16,021 --> 00:04:18,399
Juliet, stop the bleeding
and stitch him up.

50
00:04:18,724 --> 00:04:19,724
She's not a surgeon.

51
00:04:19,782 --> 00:04:20,782
She can't fix this.

52
00:04:23,195 --> 00:04:24,195
He's right.

53
00:04:34,031 --> 00:04:35,031
Let's go.

54
00:04:37,318 --> 00:04:38,331
<i>Warning.</i>

55
00:04:38,332 --> 00:04:39,332
Sawyer, let's go!

56
00:04:53,779 --> 00:04:55,579
Then what the hell do you suggest we do?

57
00:04:58,402 --> 00:04:59,644
Go get Danny,

58
00:05:00,067 --> 00:05:03,515
then find Austen and Ford
and bring them back.

59
00:05:03,605 --> 00:05:07,158
- No, you do that, and Ben dies.
- Go.

60
00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:09,808
You think I'm lying?
Do you think this is a bluff?

61
00:05:09,865 --> 00:05:12,605
- I will let him die!
- No, Jack, you won't.

62
00:05:15,317 --> 00:05:17,185
Go. Get them back.

63
00:05:18,544 --> 00:05:19,728
If you have to...

64
00:05:21,792 --> 00:05:22,841
kill them.

<i>- Dr. Burke?</i>
- Yes.

67
00:06:04,133 --> 00:06:05,828
<i>This is Diana from Mittelos Bioscience.</i>

68
00:06:05,883 --> 00:06:07,905
<i>I'm calling to confirm
your appointment tomorrow.</i>

69
00:06:08,004 --> 00:06:09,188
Uh, 2:00, right?

70
00:06:09,259 --> 00:06:10,868
<i>2:00. Dr. Alpert asked me to tell you</i>

71
00:06:10,925 --> 00:06:12,985
<i>that he's very much looking forward
to meeting you.</i>

72
00:06:13,010 --> 00:06:14,540
Me, too. Thank you.

73
00:06:14,713 --> 00:06:15,713
<i>Good-Bye.</i>

74
00:07:07,534 --> 00:07:08,534
Stay here.

75
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:14,744
Hello, Juliet.

76
00:07:23,808 --> 00:07:25,348
Why exactly are you here?

77
00:07:25,968 --> 00:07:27,297
Oh, I, m...

78
00:07:27,335 --> 00:07:28,519
today's lab work...

79
00:07:28,664 --> 00:07:31,697
I got home, and I realized
that inverted some numbers.

80
00:07:32,393 --> 00:07:34,127
And it couldn't wait till the morning?

81
00:07:36,031 --> 00:07:37,465
Um... Edmund?

82
00:07:38,934 --> 00:07:39,934
I'm sorry.

83
00:07:40,187 --> 00:07:41,187
How rude of me.

84
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,819
Uh, Juliet, this is Sherry.

85
00:07:42,897 --> 00:07:44,452
Sherry, this is Juliet,

86
00:07:45,244 --> 00:07:46,244
My ex-wife.

87
00:07:50,103 --> 00:07:51,103
Juliet's leaving.

88
00:07:54,051 --> 00:07:55,051
I am.

89
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:03,737
Could you please turn off the lights?

90
00:08:15,962 --> 00:08:17,542
You haven't thought this through, Jack.

91
00:08:17,552 --> 00:08:19,005
Your plan's not gonna work.

92
00:08:19,254 --> 00:08:20,438
Yeah? Why is that?

93
00:08:20,469 --> 00:08:22,645
Your friends aren't going
to make it back to your side

94
00:08:22,665 --> 00:08:24,822
of the island
because we're not on that island.

95
00:08:26,514 --> 00:08:29,027
We're on a smaller island
2 miles offshore.

96
00:08:31,571 --> 00:08:32,571
'Fraid so.

97
00:08:37,779 --> 00:08:39,407
So why don't we see if we can come up

98
00:08:39,444 --> 00:08:41,526
with some kind of peaceful resolution?

99
00:08:44,738 --> 00:08:45,958
A peaceful resolution?

100
00:08:46,015 --> 00:08:47,017
That's right.

101
00:08:47,039 --> 00:08:49,092
Is that what you call
asking me to kill Ben

102
00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:50,575
while on the operang table--

103
00:08:50,662 --> 00:08:52,804
- Make it look like an accident?
- That's ridiculous.

104
00:08:52,828 --> 00:08:54,378
- She wants Ben to die.
- He's lying.

105
00:08:54,401 --> 00:08:56,750
She said if I did it,
that she would protect me--

106
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,003
Enough!

107
00:09:03,830 --> 00:09:04,850
Get out.

108
00:09:05,467 --> 00:09:06,786
Tom, he's lying.

109
00:09:06,823 --> 00:09:08,392
You said you can't stitch him up...

110
00:09:08,821 --> 00:09:10,429
then you don't need to be in here.

111
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:12,780
Go, Julie.

112
00:09:20,392 --> 00:09:21,700
Don't let him fool you.

113
00:09:22,391 --> 00:09:24,442
He'll never let a patient just die.

114
00:09:31,694 --> 00:09:32,946
Can anybody hear me?!

115
00:09:36,259 --> 00:09:37,259
What happened?

116
00:09:37,512 --> 00:09:38,512
Open the cage.

117
00:09:38,552 --> 00:09:40,486
- Where is--
- Just open the damn cage!

118
00:10:00,302 --> 00:10:01,409
That's our island?

119
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:03,559
What, you didn't believe me
when I told you before?

120
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:04,613
We need a boat.

121
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:07,020
Yeah, a couple of towels
and a buffet lunch.

122
00:10:07,058 --> 00:10:08,156
We'll follow the beach.

123
00:10:08,202 --> 00:10:09,936
There's gotta be one
around here somewhere.

124
00:10:09,955 --> 00:10:11,438
How else do they get back and forth?

125
00:10:11,876 --> 00:10:14,119
Why don't we just stop
and ask for directions?

126
00:10:17,632 --> 00:10:19,038
<i>Jack, are you there?</i>

127
00:10:20,076 --> 00:10:21,733
<i>- Yeah, I'm here.</i>
- Are you okay?

128
00:10:21,784 --> 00:10:23,382
<i>- I'm fine.</i>
- Tell him I said "hi"?

129
00:10:23,421 --> 00:10:25,402
- Get to the point!
- We need a boat.

130
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:28,151
We need some way
to get off of this island.

131
00:10:29,002 --> 00:10:30,002
You heard her.

132
00:10:31,049 --> 00:10:32,753
How do they get off this island?!

133
00:10:34,792 --> 00:10:35,792
What's he doing?

134
00:10:48,411 --> 00:10:49,411
Come on!

135
00:11:34,112 --> 00:11:35,112
This way!

136
00:11:36,611 --> 00:11:38,064
Jason, you all right?

137
00:11:41,151 --> 00:11:42,373
Over there! There!

138
00:11:51,293 --> 00:11:54,218
Come on! Get inside, get inside! Go!

139
00:11:59,357 --> 00:12:00,357
Come on!

140
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:06,142
Be quiet, be quiet, be quiet.

141
00:12:10,528 --> 00:12:11,528
What?

142
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:14,030
Where'd they go?

143
00:12:14,733 --> 00:12:15,733
That way.

144
00:12:26,499 --> 00:12:27,683
Nice to meet you, Sheena.

145
00:12:30,407 --> 00:12:31,407
Is it true?

146
00:12:32,057 --> 00:12:33,057
Is what true?

147
00:12:33,410 --> 00:12:34,410
What you said--

148
00:12:35,465 --> 00:12:37,689
Did Juliet really ask you to kill him?

149
00:12:40,111 --> 00:12:41,132
Yeah...

150
00:12:41,583 --> 00:12:43,980
and in about 40 minutes,
she's gonna get her wish.

151
00:12:51,095 --> 00:12:53,928
That's... not... helping...

152
00:12:55,104 --> 00:12:56,104
anything.

153
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:02,110
Now...

154
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:06,302
could somebody please get Juliet?

155
00:13:17,729 --> 00:13:19,452
Edmund wants to see you in his office.

156
00:13:21,599 --> 00:13:22,599
Do you work here?

157
00:13:23,696 --> 00:13:25,265
I'm the new research assistant.

158
00:13:27,607 --> 00:13:28,607
Of course you are.

159
00:13:44,932 --> 00:13:45,932
I want in.

160
00:13:48,033 --> 00:13:49,033
In on what?

161
00:13:49,086 --> 00:13:50,636
I know what you're doing, Juliet.

162
00:13:53,593 --> 00:13:54,796
I'm not really sure what--

163
00:13:54,841 --> 00:13:56,044
I read your notes.

164
00:13:57,444 --> 00:13:58,955
I know what you took from the lab.

165
00:13:59,048 --> 00:14:00,617
The only thing I don't know is...

166
00:14:02,149 --> 00:14:03,812
who's your guinea pig?

167
00:14:06,622 --> 00:14:07,787
Ed, I've...

168
00:14:08,373 --> 00:14:12,658
I've been doing my research
in my own lab, on my own time.

169
00:14:13,082 --> 00:14:15,427
- I don't really see--
- It's your sister, isn't it?

170
00:14:17,887 --> 00:14:20,988
Look, Jules,
there's two ways this plays out--

171
00:14:22,333 --> 00:14:27,572
One is, your research is
potentially genius.

172
00:14:29,452 --> 00:14:30,452
And the other,

173
00:14:31,563 --> 00:14:34,923
you're raising
some very serious ethical questions,

174
00:14:36,016 --> 00:14:37,893
maybe even criminal concerns...

175
00:14:40,018 --> 00:14:42,126
but if you collaborate with me,

176
00:14:44,151 --> 00:14:45,836
based on my reputation,

177
00:14:47,224 --> 00:14:51,076
all this is viewed
as cutting edge science.

178
00:14:51,661 --> 00:14:56,196
And we will win prizes
and drink Champagne

179
00:14:57,766 --> 00:14:59,797
and do a lot of good for people.

180
00:15:10,132 --> 00:15:12,375
Why don't I give you some time
to think about it?

181
00:15:33,374 --> 00:15:34,374
Ben's awake.

182
00:15:36,629 --> 00:15:37,629
How?

183
00:15:38,193 --> 00:15:41,592
Shephard says he's a spinal surgeon,
not an anesthesiologist.

184
00:15:44,203 --> 00:15:45,599
Ben's asking for you.

185
00:15:55,668 --> 00:15:58,836
This a hobby of yours, underdog,
digging holes?

186
00:15:59,021 --> 00:16:01,611
Yep, that and basket weaving.

187
00:16:01,778 --> 00:16:02,778
Want one?

188
00:16:04,529 --> 00:16:06,291
Happen to have a tunnel to the mainland?

189
00:16:06,436 --> 00:16:07,755
No, but I've got a boat.

190
00:16:09,786 --> 00:16:10,819
Can we use it?

191
00:16:10,893 --> 00:16:12,762
Yeah, but we've got to hurry.

192
00:16:12,905 --> 00:16:14,195
Hold on a second, sister.

193
00:16:14,406 --> 00:16:17,363
You just happen to find us in the woods,
you just happen to have a boat,

194
00:16:17,372 --> 00:16:19,087
and you're gonna let us use it, huh?

195
00:16:20,711 --> 00:16:22,310
There's something we need to do first.

196
00:16:22,368 --> 00:16:23,423
Oh, gee...

197
00:16:23,481 --> 00:16:25,233
My boyfriend is being held prisoner.

198
00:16:25,919 --> 00:16:27,676
If you help me rescue him,
I promise you,

199
00:16:27,753 --> 00:16:29,506
I'll get you back to the other island.

200
00:16:30,417 --> 00:16:33,884
Your boyfriend--
his name happen to be Karl?

201
00:16:37,032 --> 00:16:38,032
Yeah.

202
00:16:39,168 --> 00:16:40,998
Ah, come on.

203
00:16:45,549 --> 00:16:46,810
I stopped the surgery.

204
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:48,100
I know.

205
00:16:49,909 --> 00:16:52,692
I've been able to hear you
for a few minutes now.

206
00:16:54,463 --> 00:16:56,051
It's very clever of you.

207
00:16:56,722 --> 00:16:58,387
I should have seen it coming.

208
00:17:01,073 --> 00:17:02,073
Are you in pain?

209
00:17:02,075 --> 00:17:03,674
- I can...
- No.

210
00:17:04,927 --> 00:17:06,669
But thanks all the same.

211
00:17:20,562 --> 00:17:23,903
I'd like to speak to Juliet alone,
please, Jack.

212
00:17:24,015 --> 00:17:25,680
No, I'm sorry.

213
00:17:25,817 --> 00:17:31,469
Please, I'm asking you...
one gentleman to another.

214
00:17:33,344 --> 00:17:35,433
It won't hurt you to give me 3 minutes,

215
00:17:35,841 --> 00:17:36,841
will it...

216
00:17:38,294 --> 00:17:41,038
Knowing I have only 27 left?

217
00:17:55,242 --> 00:17:56,243
If you touch him,

218
00:17:56,301 --> 00:17:57,611
- if you try to--
- I won't.

219
00:18:02,336 --> 00:18:03,674
You've got three minutes.

220
00:18:28,291 --> 00:18:30,130
I'm Tom, by the way.

221
00:18:51,513 --> 00:18:52,889
They've got history.

222
00:19:11,014 --> 00:19:12,968
I would like for you to go back
in there,

223
00:19:13,264 --> 00:19:15,141
put Ben under and finish the surgery.

224
00:19:18,026 --> 00:19:19,711
And why would I want to do that?

225
00:19:20,827 --> 00:19:23,147
Because I'm going to go help
your friends escape.

226
00:19:33,621 --> 00:19:36,914
Thank you for taking the time
to let us make our pitch, Dr. Burke.

227
00:19:37,195 --> 00:19:39,746
Mittelos Bioscience is based in Oregon.

228
00:19:39,828 --> 00:19:41,349
We're just outside of Portland.

229
00:19:45,313 --> 00:19:47,279
These shots might seem a little,
uh, cheeseball,

230
00:19:47,313 --> 00:19:49,417
but our people really are this happy.

231
00:19:49,926 --> 00:19:52,218
Now why? Because we're privately funded.

232
00:19:52,273 --> 00:19:54,401
Privately funded means freedom.

233
00:19:57,426 --> 00:20:01,017
We organize trips every week
in and around the Portland area,

234
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:05,211
which is just awesome for hiking
and biking and river running.

235
00:20:07,576 --> 00:20:08,847
Look, when you--

236
00:20:09,850 --> 00:20:12,040
your company reached out to me,
I was flattered,

237
00:20:12,098 --> 00:20:14,341
but I don't really know
why you would want me to--

238
00:20:14,444 --> 00:20:18,797
Is it true that you successfully
impregnated a male field mouse?

239
00:20:20,556 --> 00:20:22,086
It didn't carry to term.

240
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:25,875
Mind if I ask you something?

241
00:20:26,014 --> 00:20:27,014
Sure.

242
00:20:31,118 --> 00:20:32,118
What do you see?

243
00:20:36,051 --> 00:20:38,025
It's a human womb, obviously.

244
00:20:38,550 --> 00:20:40,748
Judging from the decomposition
of the endometrium,

245
00:20:40,768 --> 00:20:43,362
I would say
that the woman was somewhere in her 70s.

246
00:20:43,465 --> 00:20:45,025
No, actually, she's 26.

247
00:20:46,663 --> 00:20:47,663
What happened to her?

248
00:20:47,813 --> 00:20:51,338
What if I told you that you could have
complete freedom and money to find out?

249
00:20:53,722 --> 00:20:55,618
We think you're special, Dr. Burke,

250
00:20:55,874 --> 00:20:57,523
and we want you to lead a team

251
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,720
of highly trained people
because we think you're just that good.

252
00:21:01,992 --> 00:21:02,992
I can't.

253
00:21:04,398 --> 00:21:05,398
Why can't you?

254
00:21:06,354 --> 00:21:08,390
My ex-husband wouldn't let me. I--

255
00:21:08,429 --> 00:21:10,321
He wouldn't want you to have
this opportunity?

256
00:21:10,378 --> 00:21:13,075
He doesn't want me to have anything.
He would never give the okay.

257
00:21:13,114 --> 00:21:14,398
Maybe we could reach out to him

258
00:21:14,474 --> 00:21:15,975
- on your behalf--
- Don't bother.

259
00:21:16,027 --> 00:21:18,049
There must be something
that he would respond to.

260
00:21:18,088 --> 00:21:20,967
If he were hit by a bus--
How about that? That would work.

261
00:21:25,121 --> 00:21:26,560
That was totally inappropriate.

262
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:28,433
- No, no--
- No, I, uh...

263
00:21:30,341 --> 00:21:32,045
I'm sorry that I wasted your time.

264
00:21:32,887 --> 00:21:35,554
- Dr. Burke, please, you--
- No, I'm sorry.

265
00:21:36,367 --> 00:21:39,053
Whatever you think I am, I'm not.

266
00:21:40,222 --> 00:21:42,484
I'm not a leader, Mr. Alpert.

267
00:21:43,494 --> 00:21:44,554
I'm a mess.

268
00:22:28,992 --> 00:22:29,992
Well, hell.

269
00:22:41,865 --> 00:22:43,156
Karl's gotta be in there.

270
00:22:43,963 --> 00:22:45,359
What, you mean you ain't sure?

271
00:22:46,367 --> 00:22:48,090
It's the only place I haven't looked.

272
00:22:48,668 --> 00:22:49,668
You know the guard?

273
00:22:50,230 --> 00:22:52,396
Yeah. His name's Aldo.

274
00:22:55,637 --> 00:22:56,994
Okay, Lollipop,

275
00:22:57,134 --> 00:23:00,456
you wanna tell me how we're gonna
get by him with one gun and no bullets?

276
00:23:00,593 --> 00:23:01,593
I've got an idea.

277
00:23:03,025 --> 00:23:04,190
Of course you do.

278
00:23:06,377 --> 00:23:07,445
Open the door!

279
00:23:08,128 --> 00:23:09,881
Alex? What the hell are you doing?

280
00:23:10,139 --> 00:23:12,982
They must've gotten out of their cages.
I caught them in the jungle.

281
00:23:13,079 --> 00:23:14,092
Now open up, Aldo!

282
00:23:14,131 --> 00:23:16,770
Just stop!
You're not supposed to be here.

283
00:23:16,808 --> 00:23:18,619
If your dad finds out,
he's gonna kill me.

284
00:23:18,638 --> 00:23:21,547
My dad was the one who told me
to bring them here, to you.

285
00:23:22,878 --> 00:23:24,486
Look, maybe you should call him.

286
00:23:24,681 --> 00:23:26,558
I'm sure he's got nothing better to do.

287
00:23:34,195 --> 00:23:35,725
Danny, I need Ben.

288
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:38,900
Why?!

289
00:23:38,951 --> 00:23:39,951
Listen, I got Alex here.

290
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:41,722
She's got Austen and Ford with her--

291
00:23:43,814 --> 00:23:46,010
Damn it, whatever she says,
don't believe it.

292
00:23:46,362 --> 00:23:48,258
You hold 'em right there. I'm on my--

293
00:23:49,218 --> 00:23:51,384
Don't get mad at me
just 'cause you were dumb enough

294
00:23:51,427 --> 00:23:53,516
to fall for the old
"wookiee prisoner" gag.

295
00:23:53,827 --> 00:23:54,827
Where's Karl?

296
00:23:55,026 --> 00:23:56,922
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

297
00:23:57,204 --> 00:23:58,330
Shoot him in the knee.

298
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:01,676
- What?
- Give me the rifle.

299
00:24:01,733 --> 00:24:03,466
We don't have time for this. I'll do it.

300
00:24:05,142 --> 00:24:07,469
Okay, all right!
He's at the end of the hall, room 23.

301
00:24:07,542 --> 00:24:08,976
Keys are in my back pocket.

302
00:24:15,404 --> 00:24:16,601
Damn good con, Freckles.

303
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,566
I almost believed
you were gonna shoot that boy.

304
00:24:18,604 --> 00:24:19,625
It wasn't a con.

305
00:24:20,695 --> 00:24:21,763
Here it is!

306
00:25:26,019 --> 00:25:27,040
Sawyer!

307
00:25:27,509 --> 00:25:28,534
Help!

308
00:25:29,698 --> 00:25:30,835
Help!

309
00:25:55,193 --> 00:25:57,075
- Is he okay?
- We got your boyfriend back.

310
00:25:57,095 --> 00:25:58,250
Now where's your damn boat?

311
00:26:04,453 --> 00:26:05,455
Idiot!

312
00:26:05,578 --> 00:26:07,273
- Where are they?
- I don't know.

313
00:26:07,601 --> 00:26:09,235
- Alex was with them.
- Danny!

314
00:26:11,995 --> 00:26:12,995
We're letting them go.

315
00:26:13,598 --> 00:26:15,299
- Letting them go?
- Ben gave the order.

316
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:17,399
- Ben's in surgery. I was just there.
- He woke up.

317
00:26:17,451 --> 00:26:19,864
- Oh, he woke up, huh?
- Shephard won't finish the surgery

318
00:26:19,903 --> 00:26:21,906
unless he knows his friends
are off the island.

319
00:26:22,010 --> 00:26:23,444
Do you want Ben to die?

320
00:26:24,169 --> 00:26:27,086
I know Ben would rather die
than let them go.

321
00:26:44,633 --> 00:26:45,720
How was the interview?

322
00:26:47,476 --> 00:26:48,706
It's not for me.

323
00:26:49,335 --> 00:26:50,954
- What?
- It's fine.

324
00:26:51,552 --> 00:26:54,008
They're too far away, anyway.
It's Portland.

325
00:26:54,038 --> 00:26:55,838
Jules, you didn't say no
because of me?

326
00:26:55,904 --> 00:26:58,350
Well, why would I wanna go
all the way to Portland

327
00:26:58,399 --> 00:27:00,295
for research that doesn't even work?

328
00:27:02,747 --> 00:27:03,892
Because it does work.

329
00:27:11,263 --> 00:27:12,263
I'm pregnant.

330
00:27:16,968 --> 00:27:18,826
I'm pre-- I'm pregnant.

331
00:27:20,674 --> 00:27:21,799
What?

332
00:27:21,911 --> 00:27:24,570
Look, look. I took a blood test, too.

333
00:27:25,183 --> 00:27:27,099
I didn't want to tell you
until I was sure.

334
00:27:30,644 --> 00:27:32,271
- It worked.
- Yeah.

335
00:27:39,866 --> 00:27:42,591
All my life, all I've ever wanted
was to have a baby,

336
00:27:42,670 --> 00:27:44,316
and now, because of you, I'm gonna...

337
00:27:49,823 --> 00:27:52,057
God, now I just need to get healthy.

338
00:27:53,837 --> 00:27:55,884
Now I just need--
I just need to get healthy

339
00:27:55,961 --> 00:27:59,274
so I can see the little bugger
get into an ivy league school, you know?

340
00:27:59,362 --> 00:28:01,451
You will. Of course you will.

341
00:28:02,457 --> 00:28:05,486
Hey, now you can tell
that bastard ex-husband of yours

342
00:28:05,487 --> 00:28:07,249
what he can do with his ethics.

343
00:28:11,698 --> 00:28:14,461
Because you're insufferable,
and you're mean.

344
00:28:15,704 --> 00:28:18,178
Well, you asked me for the truth, mom,
and that's--

345
00:28:21,019 --> 00:28:22,560
Let me call you later, okay?

346
00:28:24,631 --> 00:28:26,373
Hello, Jules. What's up?

347
00:28:26,884 --> 00:28:27,884
She's pregnant.

348
00:28:28,979 --> 00:28:30,045
Excuse me?

349
00:28:30,151 --> 00:28:32,195
It worked. Rachel's pregnant.

350
00:28:35,290 --> 00:28:36,994
Julie, that's...

351
00:28:40,803 --> 00:28:42,931
I need, uh, I need to see your labs.

352
00:28:43,051 --> 00:28:44,947
We'll have to verify the data before--

353
00:28:45,013 --> 00:28:46,013
No.

354
00:28:46,868 --> 00:28:48,976
I'm not interested in publishing, Ed.

355
00:28:50,228 --> 00:28:51,228
It's my sister.

356
00:28:51,883 --> 00:28:55,147
Fine, then if you're not interested,
why are you concerned if--

357
00:29:15,261 --> 00:29:16,261
You okay?

358
00:29:16,510 --> 00:29:17,510
Yeah.

359
00:29:18,812 --> 00:29:20,458
I just don't like blood too much.

360
00:29:21,719 --> 00:29:22,719
Well...

361
00:29:23,128 --> 00:29:25,891
then you probably
won't wanna be looking at that.

362
00:29:29,929 --> 00:29:32,750
So, uh,
if you really can get off the island,

363
00:29:32,838 --> 00:29:34,773
why didn't you
just take him to a facility?

364
00:29:35,238 --> 00:29:36,238
Why all this?

365
00:29:37,044 --> 00:29:40,096
Because ever since
the sky turned purple, we--

366
00:29:41,651 --> 00:29:42,796
What the hell happened?!

367
00:29:44,004 --> 00:29:45,284
I just nicked an artery.

368
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:47,306
Isn't that what you already did?!

369
00:29:47,513 --> 00:29:49,968
Yeah, well, that was on purpose.

370
00:29:51,208 --> 00:29:52,507
Can you fix it?

371
00:29:53,779 --> 00:29:54,779
Damn it.

372
00:30:01,174 --> 00:30:02,360
- You got him?
- I got him.

373
00:30:04,441 --> 00:30:05,441
Nice ride!

374
00:30:05,934 --> 00:30:07,485
- Help me.
- We gotta go now, okay?

375
00:30:08,341 --> 00:30:09,341
Can you stand?

376
00:30:09,938 --> 00:30:11,199
All right, come on.

377
00:30:14,252 --> 00:30:17,343
So... you're the boss' daughter, huh?

378
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:20,079
Never saw that coming.

379
00:30:21,312 --> 00:30:22,380
Let's go, Cheech.

380
00:30:22,949 --> 00:30:24,301
We're goin' for a little ride.

381
00:30:25,604 --> 00:30:27,799
- Careful.
- All right, easy.

382
00:30:28,945 --> 00:30:30,900
I'm gonna put you in the boat,
all right?

383
00:30:32,076 --> 00:30:33,076
Wait, wait.

384
00:30:36,165 --> 00:30:37,781
- You're gonna be okay.
- Danny...

385
00:30:37,782 --> 00:30:38,927
No, Sawyer.

386
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:41,240
Danny!

387
00:31:13,891 --> 00:31:15,524
- What happened? Is he--
- I can't see.

388
00:31:15,597 --> 00:31:16,797
- What?
- I can't see.

389
00:31:16,798 --> 00:31:17,866
There's too much blood.

390
00:31:18,053 --> 00:31:19,160
All right, get over here.

391
00:31:19,708 --> 00:31:22,317
Tom, he's gonna die
if you don't get over here right now.

392
00:31:26,670 --> 00:31:27,670
Go.

393
00:31:29,917 --> 00:31:30,917
Get outta here.

394
00:31:33,021 --> 00:31:34,021
You heard the lady.

395
00:31:36,833 --> 00:31:37,833
Let's go.

396
00:31:37,991 --> 00:31:39,128
Not you, Alex.

397
00:31:40,084 --> 00:31:41,961
- You're staying.
- Why?

398
00:31:42,841 --> 00:31:44,198
We both know your father,

399
00:31:44,390 --> 00:31:47,635
and the only way he'll let Karl live
is if you're here when he wakes up.

400
00:31:51,855 --> 00:31:53,231
I'm sorry, Alex.

401
00:32:02,414 --> 00:32:03,414
Hey, Alex.

402
00:32:06,577 --> 00:32:07,752
I missed you.

403
00:32:08,825 --> 00:32:09,825
I know.

404
00:32:10,125 --> 00:32:11,232
I missed you, too.

405
00:32:14,089 --> 00:32:15,841
You have to go away now,

406
00:32:16,650 --> 00:32:18,537
but I'll see you real soon, okay?

407
00:32:19,887 --> 00:32:20,887
I love you.

408
00:32:26,950 --> 00:32:28,750
I have to go to sleep now.

409
00:32:41,324 --> 00:32:42,324
Wait.

410
00:32:45,682 --> 00:32:47,492
Easy. Okay, easy.

411
00:32:51,437 --> 00:32:53,468
- Wait, wait--
- Hold it steady, damn it.

412
00:32:53,536 --> 00:32:54,536
Hold it steady.

413
00:32:58,195 --> 00:32:59,302
<i>Jack, are you there?</i>

414
00:33:04,655 --> 00:33:06,200
All right, hold that up to me.

415
00:33:06,913 --> 00:33:09,331
- The walkie-- Hold it up to me.
- What about the surgery--

416
00:33:09,388 --> 00:33:10,467
Just do it!

417
00:33:17,914 --> 00:33:19,581
Yeah, I'm here, Kate. You okay?

418
00:33:20,525 --> 00:33:23,057
Yeah, I... we've got a boat.

419
00:33:23,133 --> 00:33:24,317
They're letting us go.

420
00:33:24,732 --> 00:33:25,732
Who's letting you go?

421
00:33:27,539 --> 00:33:28,539
The blonde woman.

422
00:33:29,290 --> 00:33:30,753
So you're safe, you and Sawyer?

423
00:33:30,888 --> 00:33:31,923
Yes, yeah.

424
00:33:32,845 --> 00:33:33,845
Tell me.

425
00:33:34,748 --> 00:33:35,748
Tell you?

426
00:33:36,054 --> 00:33:38,106
The first day on the beach,
the day of the crash--

427
00:33:38,125 --> 00:33:40,629
The story that I told you--
If you're safe, tell me.

428
00:33:41,285 --> 00:33:43,461
- You think this is the best time--
- Shut up!

429
00:33:46,763 --> 00:33:50,200
You... were doing surgery on a girl...

430
00:33:52,927 --> 00:33:53,927
and you messed up.

431
00:33:54,689 --> 00:33:55,689
You made a mistake.

432
00:33:58,297 --> 00:34:00,059
<i>You tore something on her back,</i>

433
00:34:00,792 --> 00:34:02,380
<i>and all the nerves came loose...</i>

434
00:34:06,506 --> 00:34:08,248
and you said you were so afraid...

435
00:34:11,110 --> 00:34:13,006
and you said the fear was so...

436
00:34:15,115 --> 00:34:19,169
real, and you didn't know what to do...

437
00:34:24,374 --> 00:34:25,761
so you counted to five...

438
00:34:29,738 --> 00:34:31,712
<i>and then you weren't afraid anymore...</i>

439
00:34:33,949 --> 00:34:35,259
<i>and then it was just gone...</i>

440
00:34:39,909 --> 00:34:40,958
and you fixed her.

441
00:34:42,711 --> 00:34:43,711
<i>You saved her.</i>

442
00:35:03,461 --> 00:35:05,280
I need you to make me a promise, Kate.

443
00:35:07,203 --> 00:35:09,881
Promise me that
you'll never come back here for me.

444
00:35:12,323 --> 00:35:13,410
Don't come back, Kate.

445
00:35:13,673 --> 00:35:14,876
Jack, where are you--

446
00:35:14,937 --> 00:35:15,953
Turn it off.

447
00:35:16,422 --> 00:35:18,907
<i>Jack? Jack, please, where are--</i>

448
00:35:32,006 --> 00:35:33,238
Trades are comin' up.

449
00:35:35,808 --> 00:35:36,808
We gotta go.

450
00:35:41,313 --> 00:35:42,313
- Let's go.
- Okay.

451
00:36:32,532 --> 00:36:34,631
We have some paperwork
that we need you to sign,

452
00:36:35,504 --> 00:36:37,311
but take your time. There's no rush.

453
00:36:37,756 --> 00:36:38,756
Thank you.

454
00:37:41,946 --> 00:37:43,881
Were you able to remove the tumor?

455
00:37:47,656 --> 00:37:48,656
Yeah.

456
00:37:52,970 --> 00:37:55,714
You'll want to do a biopsy,
see if it's malignant.

457
00:38:01,477 --> 00:38:04,452
So what now, I just go back to my cell?

458
00:38:06,107 --> 00:38:07,975
Until they figure out
what to do with you.

459
00:38:12,841 --> 00:38:13,841
"They"...

460
00:38:19,685 --> 00:38:20,685
What did he say?

461
00:38:21,934 --> 00:38:22,934
I'm sorry?

462
00:38:23,233 --> 00:38:27,432
Ben-- What did he say
that made you want to save his life?

463
00:38:32,482 --> 00:38:34,224
It doesn't really matter what he said.

464
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:35,776
It matters to me.

465
00:38:37,687 --> 00:38:41,028
After everything
that I have been put through,

466
00:38:42,646 --> 00:38:44,042
you owe me an answer.

467
00:38:45,882 --> 00:38:47,192
And I wanna know what he said.

468
00:39:07,175 --> 00:39:08,215
Tissue?

469
00:39:09,133 --> 00:39:11,492
Thank you. Thanks.

470
00:39:22,552 --> 00:39:23,552
Have we met?

471
00:39:23,657 --> 00:39:25,149
Hello, Dr. Burke.

472
00:39:28,227 --> 00:39:32,119
- Mr. Alpert?
- I'm, so sorry for your loss.

473
00:39:34,689 --> 00:39:35,868
What are you doing here?

474
00:39:36,393 --> 00:39:38,386
I saw what happened on the news,

475
00:39:38,645 --> 00:39:40,710
end, uh, your office said
you were down here.

476
00:39:40,806 --> 00:39:43,503
I just wanted to express my condolences
in person

477
00:39:44,197 --> 00:39:45,680
before I went back up to Portland.

478
00:39:45,798 --> 00:39:47,808
This is Ethan.
He's one of my colleagues.

479
00:39:47,965 --> 00:39:49,322
It's a pleasure to meet you.

480
00:39:56,636 --> 00:39:57,916
He was hit by a bus.

481
00:39:58,642 --> 00:40:00,986
I know. They say
you were there when it happened.

482
00:40:01,136 --> 00:40:04,824
- It must have been--
- No, no, in our interview,

483
00:40:06,195 --> 00:40:07,921
I said-- I said that I wanted--

484
00:40:08,047 --> 00:40:09,828
I wanted him to get hit by a bus.

485
00:40:12,754 --> 00:40:16,230
Dr. Burke, I realize
you're a little shook up right now,

486
00:40:16,366 --> 00:40:18,205
but this is just a tragic accident.

487
00:40:18,466 --> 00:40:19,708
You can'blame yourself.

488
00:40:20,916 --> 00:40:22,928
I don't even rember you saying that.

489
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:29,878
Why are you here, Mr. Alpert?

490
00:40:30,882 --> 00:40:31,882
Look, uh...

491
00:40:32,692 --> 00:40:34,492
I know the timing is horrible,

492
00:40:34,587 --> 00:40:37,292
but we came because we're that serious

493
00:40:37,342 --> 00:40:39,258
about getting you to come work with us.

494
00:40:41,856 --> 00:40:43,541
Just give us six months.

495
00:40:44,047 --> 00:40:46,936
If you need to, you'll be back
before your sister gives birth.

496
00:40:49,909 --> 00:40:52,028
- How did you know that my--
- Well, we're very...

497
00:40:52,162 --> 00:40:53,857
thorough in our recruitment process.

498
00:41:04,178 --> 00:41:05,400
Can my sister come?

499
00:41:06,102 --> 00:41:07,802
Won't work. We're pretty remote.

500
00:41:08,104 --> 00:41:10,617
She wouldn't have access
to the treatment that she needs.

501
00:41:11,304 --> 00:41:12,311
But it's Portland.

502
00:41:12,312 --> 00:41:14,632
- There's plenty of clinics and--
- Well, actually,

503
00:41:15,014 --> 00:41:16,622
we're not quite in Portland.

504
00:41:28,091 --> 00:41:29,410
I wanna know what he said.

505
00:41:35,995 --> 00:41:38,883
I've been on this island
for three years, Jack--

506
00:41:40,001 --> 00:41:43,361
3 years, 2 months and 28 days.

507
00:41:47,208 --> 00:41:48,912
He said that if I...

508
00:41:51,215 --> 00:41:52,215
let him live...

509
00:41:54,779 --> 00:41:55,779
and I helped you...

510
00:42:02,041 --> 00:42:04,573
that he would finally let me go home.
