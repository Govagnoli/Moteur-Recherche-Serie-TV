1
00:00:00,848 --> 00:00:02,127
Previously on "Lost"...

2
00:00:02,264 --> 00:00:03,925
We're gonna have
to take the boy.

3
00:00:04,064 --> 00:00:05,724
I'm not giving you anybody!

4
00:00:05,817 --> 00:00:08,478
- Dad! Dad!
- Walt!

5
00:00:14,972 --> 00:00:16,440
Where is she?

6
00:00:16,795 --> 00:00:19,599
- You mean Kate?
- I love her.

7
00:00:33,803 --> 00:00:38,182
Kate! Kate!

8
00:00:42,574 --> 00:00:44,567
Look here and here.

9
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:48,323
You can see it's eroding up the
spinal artery in the l5 area.

10
00:00:48,464 --> 00:00:51,442
Plus all this
extradural growth--

11
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:54,177
I'm surprised it hasn't
caused permanent ischemia.

12
00:00:58,612 --> 00:01:01,082
He says you don't need
to talk in whispers.

13
00:01:01,176 --> 00:01:03,175
He knows he doesn't
have a chance.

14
00:01:04,009 --> 00:01:05,908
Your father appreciates candor.

15
00:01:05,954 --> 00:01:07,329
We both do.

16
00:01:08,635 --> 00:01:11,297
Well, then tell
him I'm very sorry,

17
00:01:11,390 --> 00:01:13,574
but he's not a
candidate for surgery.

18
00:01:21,196 --> 00:01:25,385
The way the tumor is situated on the
spine, it's just not possible to
remove it.

19
00:01:27,767 --> 00:01:30,955
He wants to know
why you won't try.

20
00:01:31,327 --> 00:01:33,942
Because what your
father is looking for

21
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:39,607
is not a surgical procedure.
What he is looking for is a miracle.

22
00:01:48,023 --> 00:01:52,306
He said, "I did not come
all this way for you, sir.

23
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:54,155
I came for him."

24
00:01:59,807 --> 00:02:02,279
Miss Busoni, I, uh--

25
00:02:02,324 --> 00:02:05,178
You fixed a woman with a
crushed spinal column--

26
00:02:05,224 --> 00:02:08,601
an impossible surgery.
And now she walks, yes?

27
00:02:08,695 --> 00:02:11,753
I consulted many medical journals
before making this trip here.

28
00:02:11,783 --> 00:02:14,174
Then you should know it
was a very different case

29
00:02:14,204 --> 00:02:16,342
under very
different circumstances.

30
00:02:16,482 --> 00:02:18,571
But a miracle, right?

31
00:02:21,514 --> 00:02:23,664
Look, everything that
my father is saying--

32
00:02:23,744 --> 00:02:27,409
the risks, the unlikelihood--
he's absolutely right.

33
00:02:27,501 --> 00:02:29,257
But will you try?

34
00:02:49,817 --> 00:02:52,367
I'll have to admit him in
the next couple of weeks,

35
00:02:52,519 --> 00:02:54,371
run some tests.

36
00:03:39,882 --> 00:03:40,684
Locke?

37
00:03:47,598 --> 00:03:48,256
John!

38
00:03:51,563 --> 00:03:55,037
- Stay in there. Stay--
- - Michael! What are you--

39
00:03:55,131 --> 00:03:59,033
- Stay in there, Jack!
- Hey, whatever's going on--

40
00:03:59,126 --> 00:04:00,543
Look, I'm going after my son.

41
00:04:00,573 --> 00:04:04,237
I'm going after my son,
and nobody is going to stop me, okay?

42
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:07,092
Okay? That is my right.
That is a father's right.

43
00:04:07,179 --> 00:04:08,473
There's another way
to go about this--

44
00:04:08,503 --> 00:04:11,203
- Get in the damn room!
- You gonna shoot me, Michael?!

45
00:04:13,032 --> 00:04:16,460
No. But I'll shoot
your damn computer.

46
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:19,238
That thing is not what
you think it is anyway.

47
00:04:19,330 --> 00:04:23,615
You don't understand, man. You don't
have any idea. Now get in there!

48
00:04:23,708 --> 00:04:25,366
Michael! Michael, listen,

49
00:04:25,506 --> 00:04:28,006
we can do this together, okay?
I'll come with you.

50
00:04:28,022 --> 00:04:30,828
No. I have to do it... now.

51
00:04:31,535 --> 00:04:34,093
I have to do it alone.

52
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:56,491
What happened?

53
00:04:56,611 --> 00:04:58,422
Michael knocked you out.

54
00:04:58,835 --> 00:04:59,969
Look over here.

55
00:05:00,062 --> 00:05:02,580
- Why would he...
- He went after Walt.

56
00:05:03,467 --> 00:05:05,842
You feel nauseated? Sick?

57
00:05:06,122 --> 00:05:08,499
No, I'm okay.

58
00:05:08,683 --> 00:05:11,445
Good. Give me a boost up.

59
00:05:13,691 --> 00:05:17,681
It's no use.
I bolted it shut from the inside.

60
00:05:17,675 --> 00:05:18,764
You did what?

61
00:05:18,995 --> 00:05:24,185
No point in changing the combination if
you can get in through the air vent.

62
00:05:24,839 --> 00:05:26,880
That's really good
thinking, John.

63
00:05:29,384 --> 00:05:31,784
You want to tell me why
you let Michael in here?

64
00:05:31,804 --> 00:05:34,466
Uh, he... he wanted a gun.

65
00:05:35,492 --> 00:05:37,252
For shooting practice.

66
00:05:38,227 --> 00:05:39,704
Shooting practice.

67
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:44,243
The button.

68
00:05:47,662 --> 00:05:51,127
- How long was I out?
- About 20 minutes.

69
00:05:52,434 --> 00:05:55,253
We're on shift for the next four hours.
There's nobody coming down here.

70
00:05:55,283 --> 00:06:00,235
Yeah, I know. We better hope Sawyer
shows up to get his band-aid changed.

71
00:06:15,402 --> 00:06:16,680
Mornin'.

72
00:06:17,618 --> 00:06:19,417
Did you just throw
a banana at me?

73
00:06:19,398 --> 00:06:21,011
Couldn't find any rocks.

74
00:06:23,018 --> 00:06:26,015
There are nicer ways to
wake a man up, Freckles.

75
00:06:26,603 --> 00:06:28,994
Come on. It's time to go
get your bandages changed.

76
00:06:29,024 --> 00:06:30,922
Well, why can't
you do it for me?

77
00:06:31,019 --> 00:06:34,824
Because I'm not your nurse,
and Jack's got the bandages.

78
00:06:35,574 --> 00:06:37,277
Of course he does.

79
00:06:42,183 --> 00:06:43,747
You want to give me a hand?

80
00:06:54,026 --> 00:06:54,972
Thanks.

81
00:06:57,737 --> 00:06:58,720
Come on.

82
00:07:02,142 --> 00:07:03,933
This place still creeps me out.

83
00:07:04,212 --> 00:07:05,586
You'll get used to it.

84
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:08,367
Where is everybody?

85
00:07:09,767 --> 00:07:11,906
Jack? John?

86
00:07:12,502 --> 00:07:14,255
Maybe they went
out for ice cream.

87
00:07:14,443 --> 00:07:15,141
Shh.

88
00:07:16,506 --> 00:07:19,014
- In here! Hey!
- Jack?

89
00:07:19,106 --> 00:07:20,481
In here! In the armory!

90
00:07:20,574 --> 00:07:22,150
Michael locked us in here!

91
00:07:22,277 --> 00:07:24,558
- What did he say?
- I got it.

92
00:07:27,734 --> 00:07:29,927
Hope you got the combo, doc.

93
00:07:30,061 --> 00:07:33,245
Right 3 times to 25.

94
00:07:33,928 --> 00:07:35,164
25, got it.

95
00:07:35,351 --> 00:07:37,624
Left 2 times to 29.

96
00:07:40,572 --> 00:07:42,656
Right once to 40.

97
00:07:47,424 --> 00:07:48,844
Howdy, boys.

98
00:07:49,123 --> 00:07:52,214
- What are you doing, Jack?
- We're going after him.

99
00:07:55,822 --> 00:07:58,522
Hey, what... what happened?

100
00:07:58,618 --> 00:08:00,371
Michael went after Walt.

101
00:08:01,736 --> 00:08:03,195
Went after Walt?

102
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:08,124
Pulled a gun on me, put us both
in there and went after Walt.

103
00:08:11,347 --> 00:08:13,927
Hey.  What are you doing?

104
00:08:14,571 --> 00:08:17,611
What does it look like?
Comin' with ya.

105
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:19,266
You're still on antibiotics.

106
00:08:19,452 --> 00:08:22,125
It's a good thing I'm
traveling with my doctor then.

107
00:08:33,142 --> 00:08:34,193
How  is he?

108
00:08:35,049 --> 00:08:36,854
Thought you'd gone home.

109
00:08:36,992 --> 00:08:39,242
My home is a hotel room.

110
00:08:41,808 --> 00:08:43,502
I like it more here.

111
00:08:45,241 --> 00:08:47,319
Think you need to
find a better hotel.

112
00:08:48,023 --> 00:08:50,215
You didn't answer my question.

113
00:08:53,286 --> 00:08:55,616
His counts aren't where
I'd like 'em to be.

114
00:08:57,577 --> 00:09:00,670
You've been doing tests
for a month now, Jack.

115
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:02,741
I'm thorough.

116
00:09:15,172 --> 00:09:17,548
I have a confession to make.

117
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:22,163
I don't believe in miracles.

118
00:09:22,921 --> 00:09:26,382
Yeah. Guess I'm not too
sure about them, either.

119
00:09:27,363 --> 00:09:30,504
I bet your wife
feels differently.

120
00:09:32,183 --> 00:09:36,421
Your wife.
She's the woman you fixed, isn't she?

121
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:37,358
Yes.

122
00:09:40,214 --> 00:09:42,211
I'm thorough, too.

123
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:49,076
She must be a very special person to
let you work until 4:30 in the morning.

124
00:09:51,038 --> 00:09:52,936
I completely lost track...

125
00:09:53,636 --> 00:09:55,726
I've gotta--
will you excuse me?

126
00:09:55,818 --> 00:09:57,574
Yes, of course. Go.

127
00:09:59,824 --> 00:10:01,381
Jack?

128
00:10:02,174 --> 00:10:03,738
Thank you.

129
00:10:04,814 --> 00:10:07,141
Yeah. Of course.

130
00:10:08,495 --> 00:10:10,108
- Good night.
- Good night.

131
00:10:20,403 --> 00:10:21,004
Hey.

132
00:10:24,362 --> 00:10:25,305
How is he?

133
00:10:26,754 --> 00:10:28,990
Hey. Sorry to wake you.

134
00:10:31,090 --> 00:10:33,281
I gotta get up anyway.

135
00:10:35,482 --> 00:10:36,660
So how is he?

136
00:10:38,336 --> 00:10:40,073
About the same.

137
00:10:46,427 --> 00:10:48,098
Sarah, I'm sorry.

138
00:10:48,513 --> 00:10:52,220
I meant to... I just got...

139
00:10:52,361 --> 00:10:58,032
Hey... that's the price of
being a miracle worker.

140
00:11:03,684 --> 00:11:04,684
Where are you going?

141
00:11:04,863 --> 00:11:08,433
I've gotta go to the gym,
and then I've got some papers to grade.

142
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:32,988
I didn't want to say anything
until I knew either way, but, um...

143
00:11:34,248 --> 00:11:37,916
I was late,
so I got a pregnancy test.

144
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:49,557
Don't worry. It's negative.

145
00:11:54,272 --> 00:11:55,742
Do you, um...

146
00:11:56,356 --> 00:11:58,345
do you want to talk about it?

147
00:11:59,867 --> 00:12:01,317
What's to talk about?

148
00:12:03,255 --> 00:12:05,086
Sarah, I...

149
00:12:05,345 --> 00:12:07,103
See you later, Jack.

150
00:12:16,776 --> 00:12:17,594
Well?

151
00:12:18,977 --> 00:12:21,177
Well, I can't tell you
it's definitely Michael's,

152
00:12:21,207 --> 00:12:23,486
but looks like his boot print.

153
00:12:23,685 --> 00:12:25,525
There's one over here, too.

154
00:12:25,668 --> 00:12:27,945
That sounds like a trail.

155
00:12:28,177 --> 00:12:31,135
- You got a gun for me?
- You're not coming.

156
00:12:31,276 --> 00:12:32,973
- Excuse me?
- You're not coming.

157
00:12:33,068 --> 00:12:35,124
Someone has to be here to
take care of the button.

158
00:12:35,154 --> 00:12:36,754
So why should that
person be me?

159
00:12:36,762 --> 00:12:40,574
- I can track, carry a gun--
- - You're not comin'. You're stayin'.

160
00:12:41,625 --> 00:12:42,401
All right?

161
00:12:48,412 --> 00:12:49,208
Let's go.

162
00:13:07,810 --> 00:13:09,327
What did she do to you?

163
00:13:09,842 --> 00:13:11,932
- What?
- Kate.

164
00:13:12,662 --> 00:13:15,992
- What did she do?
- She didn't do anything.

165
00:13:16,085 --> 00:13:16,987
Right.

166
00:13:17,729 --> 00:13:22,241
You yellin' at her 'cause she wanted to
help get Mike back makes a lot of sense.

167
00:13:22,329 --> 00:13:24,979
Why don't you go back and
see if I hurt her feelings?

168
00:13:25,081 --> 00:13:26,503
I'm just sayin'.

169
00:13:26,608 --> 00:13:30,129
Yeah. I know. You love her.

170
00:13:30,585 --> 00:13:32,391
What did you say?

171
00:13:35,379 --> 00:13:36,133
What?

172
00:13:37,815 --> 00:13:41,241
Does any of this look familiar
from when you were coming back?

173
00:13:41,375 --> 00:13:44,215
Oh, yeah.
There's my favorite leaf.

174
00:13:44,427 --> 00:13:46,160
How could I forget this place?

175
00:13:46,251 --> 00:13:47,341
What's wrong?

176
00:13:47,461 --> 00:13:51,511
When you came across the island,
what side was the ocean on?

177
00:13:59,128 --> 00:14:01,857
You came from the east.
Michael's heading north.

178
00:14:01,931 --> 00:14:03,416
What  the hell's that
supposed to mean?

179
00:14:03,446 --> 00:14:06,155
That means he's not going
back to where you came from.

180
00:14:08,447 --> 00:14:11,107
He's heading somewhere else.

181
00:14:24,709 --> 00:14:26,180
*The sun's very strong today.

182
00:14:26,364 --> 00:14:27,928
*I don't need a hat.

183
00:14:28,441 --> 00:14:29,959
*I know.

184
00:14:31,384 --> 00:14:33,195
*Just wear it.

185
00:14:36,557 --> 00:14:38,409
*I think something's wrong.

186
00:14:43,975 --> 00:14:46,491
- Hello, Hurley.
- Hey.

187
00:14:47,002 --> 00:14:48,710
Cool hat, dude.

188
00:14:51,095 --> 00:14:54,376
- Is Kate all right?
- Uh... yeah.

189
00:14:56,058 --> 00:14:58,447
I guess Michael took off.

190
00:14:58,855 --> 00:15:00,485
*What's he saying?

191
00:15:01,142 --> 00:15:02,782
What do you mean, he took off?

192
00:15:02,921 --> 00:15:05,502
He stole some guns,
and he went all commando.

193
00:15:05,645 --> 00:15:08,004
Said he was going after Walt.

194
00:15:09,077 --> 00:15:11,645
Later, dudes.
Gotta get to the hatch.

195
00:15:18,841 --> 00:15:20,697
*What are you doing?

196
00:15:20,841 --> 00:15:22,456
*He said they just left.

197
00:15:22,493 --> 00:15:24,268
*If I hurry I can catch up...

198
00:15:24,572 --> 00:15:26,200
*You're not going anywhere.

199
00:15:26,564 --> 00:15:27,932
*Don't go!

200
00:15:28,498 --> 00:15:31,075
*Don't walk away from me!

201
00:15:31,992 --> 00:15:34,037
*While you were on that raft...

202
00:15:34,267 --> 00:15:36,549
*do you know how worried I was?

203
00:15:37,295 --> 00:15:40,197
*I didn't know if you
were dead or alive.

204
00:15:40,945 --> 00:15:43,128
*I was out of my head.

205
00:15:44,839 --> 00:15:46,643
*I won't go through taht again.

206
00:15:49,725 --> 00:15:51,906
*Michael's my friend.

207
00:15:54,107 --> 00:15:56,323
*I'm your wife.

208
00:16:17,129 --> 00:16:20,163
Hey, doc. Wanna slow down?

209
00:16:22,686 --> 00:16:24,252
Take a break a minute?

210
00:16:24,999 --> 00:16:25,972
Good idea.

211
00:16:30,108 --> 00:16:31,555
He still heading north?

212
00:16:33,179 --> 00:16:34,228
Yup.

213
00:16:34,678 --> 00:16:36,271
You think he's lost?

214
00:16:36,486 --> 00:16:37,898
Doesn't seem to be.

215
00:16:38,066 --> 00:16:39,966
Trail's as straight
as the interstate.

216
00:16:40,653 --> 00:16:43,110
The path of a man who
knows where he's going.

217
00:16:45,585 --> 00:16:47,439
Where are you going, Jack?

218
00:16:48,942 --> 00:16:50,306
What?

219
00:16:51,051 --> 00:16:53,491
Well, let's say we catch
up with him-- Michael.

220
00:16:53,615 --> 00:16:55,276
What are you gonna do?

221
00:16:56,161 --> 00:16:57,536
I'm gonna bring him back.

222
00:16:57,909 --> 00:16:59,759
What  if he doesn't
want to come back?

223
00:17:00,826 --> 00:17:02,678
I'll talk him into coming back.

224
00:17:03,284 --> 00:17:06,484
This is the second time he's gone
after Walt. He knocked me out.

225
00:17:06,593 --> 00:17:08,444
He locked us both up.

226
00:17:08,582 --> 00:17:12,129
Something tells me he might
be past listening to reason.

227
00:17:12,666 --> 00:17:16,622
What, you think we should just
let him go, write him off?

228
00:17:16,772 --> 00:17:21,595
Who are we to tell anyone
what they can or can't do?

229
00:17:36,130 --> 00:17:38,125
It's not too late to go back.

230
00:17:38,218 --> 00:17:39,401
The tumor's aggressive,

231
00:17:39,543 --> 00:17:43,101
but your father could lead a very
normal life for at least another year.

232
00:17:43,131 --> 00:17:43,911
Go back?

233
00:17:44,048 --> 00:17:46,759
Go back where? Home?

234
00:17:48,535 --> 00:17:50,386
Have you changed
your mind, Jack?

235
00:17:50,478 --> 00:17:53,214
No.  No.

236
00:18:03,424 --> 00:18:04,562
Is that it?

237
00:18:12,208 --> 00:18:17,641
Even if you don't succeed,
you're giving us a chance.

238
00:18:19,142 --> 00:18:20,998
That's all we wanted.

239
00:18:24,653 --> 00:18:27,466
I'll come out and check
on you before I scrub in.

240
00:18:28,773 --> 00:18:29,669
Okay.

241
00:18:34,715 --> 00:18:36,116
Am I interrupting?

242
00:18:37,490 --> 00:18:39,723
No. I was just leaving.

243
00:18:43,603 --> 00:18:45,548
I'll see you in the morning.

244
00:18:46,623 --> 00:18:48,482
I'll see you in the morning.

245
00:18:54,922 --> 00:18:58,873
I.T.R. Reports need to be signed
by you as chief resident.

246
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:05,186
What?

247
00:19:06,447 --> 00:19:08,079
Careful.

248
00:19:10,567 --> 00:19:11,911
There's a line, son.

249
00:19:12,144 --> 00:19:13,341
You know it's there.

250
00:19:13,793 --> 00:19:15,598
And pretending it's not...

251
00:19:16,414 --> 00:19:17,819
that would be a mistake.

252
00:19:21,593 --> 00:19:23,349
Guess you would know.

253
00:19:27,650 --> 00:19:30,675
It may be okay for
some people, Jack,

254
00:19:31,001 --> 00:19:32,757
but not for you.

255
00:20:00,613 --> 00:20:02,758
Sure Mike went this way?

256
00:20:03,459 --> 00:20:04,978
Why do you ask?

257
00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:06,915
Oh, I don't know, Mr. Clean.

258
00:20:07,005 --> 00:20:10,773
I probably would have gone
around Mount Vesuvius.

259
00:20:12,213 --> 00:20:14,361
Why did you pick that name?

260
00:20:16,203 --> 00:20:18,452
Ain't it obvious?

261
00:20:18,857 --> 00:20:22,400
All you need's an
earring and a mop.

262
00:20:23,596 --> 00:20:26,829
No, your name.
Why did you pick "Sawyer"?

263
00:20:27,248 --> 00:20:28,838
What do you mean, "pick"?

264
00:20:28,907 --> 00:20:33,241
After the census,
Hurley gave me the flight manifest.

265
00:20:34,267 --> 00:20:38,411
Your name is James.
Right? James Ford.

266
00:20:39,109 --> 00:20:41,232
What's it to you?

267
00:20:41,538 --> 00:20:44,508
Just an interesting name to choose,
is all.

268
00:20:44,666 --> 00:20:46,479
Who'd you get it from?

269
00:20:46,574 --> 00:20:49,545
Who says I got it from anybody?

270
00:20:55,878 --> 00:20:58,637
- Michael!
- Jack, get down!

271
00:20:58,778 --> 00:21:02,355
- Michael!
- Jack! Jack!

272
00:21:09,575 --> 00:21:10,397
Michael!

273
00:21:16,002 --> 00:21:17,759
- Michael!
- Jack.

274
00:21:20,235 --> 00:21:21,192
What?

275
00:21:24,085 --> 00:21:25,140
He's close.

276
00:21:25,544 --> 00:21:28,375
Yeah, and if he was shooting at someone,
you want 'em coming back?

277
00:21:28,405 --> 00:21:29,666
Personally, hell, yeah.

278
00:21:29,871 --> 00:21:32,054
You said these people were
two days across the island.

279
00:21:32,084 --> 00:21:34,989
Yeah, and they took Cindy less
than a mile from our camp.

280
00:21:35,075 --> 00:21:35,924
Over here.

281
00:21:42,114 --> 00:21:45,485
- Shell casings. How many?
- Three. Michael's.

282
00:21:45,565 --> 00:21:48,465
You boys deaf?
I heard at least seven shots.

283
00:21:48,619 --> 00:21:51,301
You heard 'em, Daniel Boone.
What's your count?

284
00:21:51,441 --> 00:21:53,530
Yeah. Seven sounds about right.

285
00:21:54,371 --> 00:21:56,175
It's gettin' dark.

286
00:21:56,361 --> 00:21:58,356
Which way did Mike go?

287
00:22:10,113 --> 00:22:10,866
What?

288
00:22:11,968 --> 00:22:16,804
You out here for Michael or
just payback for getting shot?

289
00:22:17,827 --> 00:22:20,131
Why are you out here, doc?

290
00:22:22,350 --> 00:22:26,701
You got your reasons,
and I got mine.

291
00:22:38,811 --> 00:22:39,596
Jack.

292
00:22:40,338 --> 00:22:41,307
Jack!

293
00:22:41,421 --> 00:22:42,844
- I had it.
- I know, son.

294
00:22:42,983 --> 00:22:45,360
I got it! I got it all.
I mean, I had it!

295
00:22:45,454 --> 00:22:50,169
He was a sick old man on a table
for seven and a half hours.

296
00:22:50,402 --> 00:22:52,984
His heart gave out.
It's nobody's fault.

297
00:22:57,750 --> 00:22:59,402
Gotta go tell her.

298
00:23:00,218 --> 00:23:02,488
Yeah, well,
I've already done that.

299
00:23:06,255 --> 00:23:10,364
Lest you forget,
I am still chief of surgery.

300
00:23:13,488 --> 00:23:14,617
Where is she?

301
00:23:16,439 --> 00:23:19,137
- Maybe you should go home.
- Where is she?

302
00:23:21,128 --> 00:23:22,560
She's gone.

303
00:23:27,767 --> 00:23:28,807
Jack...

304
00:23:30,192 --> 00:23:31,277
go home.

305
00:23:56,517 --> 00:23:57,277
Jack?

306
00:24:01,197 --> 00:24:02,316
Gabriela.

307
00:24:07,870 --> 00:24:10,464
My father told me that you'd gone.
I, uh...

308
00:24:14,503 --> 00:24:16,807
- I, uh...
- Thank you.

309
00:24:17,578 --> 00:24:19,569
Thank you for trying.

310
00:24:25,439 --> 00:24:29,744
Gabriela... I'm so sorry.

311
00:24:36,897 --> 00:24:42,787
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry that I couldn't...

312
00:24:51,442 --> 00:24:53,973
- Wha...
- It's okay.

313
00:24:56,144 --> 00:24:57,517
I...

314
00:24:58,841 --> 00:24:59,764
I'm...

315
00:25:04,039 --> 00:25:05,255
I can't.

316
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:19,190
What do you mean, you lost it?

317
00:25:19,312 --> 00:25:21,264
He's a man, not a boar.

318
00:25:21,403 --> 00:25:23,968
The signs' more subtle.
I need light to follow.

319
00:25:24,113 --> 00:25:24,707
Here.

320
00:25:25,819 --> 00:25:26,688
Light.

321
00:25:30,239 --> 00:25:31,900
I think we'd better head back.

322
00:25:32,041 --> 00:25:32,512
What?

323
00:25:32,649 --> 00:25:34,610
- Just find the trail, John.
- I've lost the trail.

324
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:36,492
You don't just lose a trail.

325
00:25:36,584 --> 00:25:38,499
You just don't
want to find him.

326
00:25:38,670 --> 00:25:40,282
Yeah, that's right, Jack.

327
00:25:40,422 --> 00:25:41,859
I've been running
through the jungle

328
00:25:41,889 --> 00:25:45,125
toward the sound of gunfire
because I don't care about Michael.

329
00:25:45,543 --> 00:25:48,095
Don't turn around on me, John.

330
00:25:48,188 --> 00:25:50,101
You're not gonna get him to come back,
and you know it!

331
00:25:50,131 --> 00:25:52,716
You know what happens if we
just turn around and go back?

332
00:25:52,746 --> 00:25:54,700
We're never gonna
see him again,

333
00:25:54,846 --> 00:25:56,349
and that's gonna be on us--

334
00:25:56,509 --> 00:25:59,469
on you and on me.

335
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:02,958
You're exactly right, Jack!

336
00:26:05,052 --> 00:26:07,043
But if I were you,

337
00:26:07,411 --> 00:26:10,599
I'd listen to Mr. Locke.

338
00:26:22,403 --> 00:26:23,659
Who are you?

339
00:26:23,907 --> 00:26:27,153
He's the son of a bitch
who shot me on the raft.

340
00:26:27,557 --> 00:26:29,904
Why don't you
point the gun down?

341
00:26:30,396 --> 00:26:31,250
Ow!

342
00:26:40,270 --> 00:26:44,707
Probably be best if we just keep
our hands at our sides, gentlemen.

343
00:26:45,331 --> 00:26:46,629
Where's Michael?

344
00:26:46,750 --> 00:26:48,555
Don't worry about Michael.

345
00:26:48,694 --> 00:26:50,577
He's not gonna find us.

346
00:26:52,115 --> 00:26:53,922
What do you want?

347
00:26:54,012 --> 00:26:56,436
Why don't you build
us a fire, John?

348
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:02,053
Think it's time we
all had a talk.

349
00:27:12,606 --> 00:27:14,746
"Geronimo Jackson"?

350
00:27:15,883 --> 00:27:16,868
Huh.

351
00:27:18,901 --> 00:27:19,797
Whoo.

352
00:27:20,386 --> 00:27:22,360
As an expert in
all things musical,

353
00:27:22,818 --> 00:27:26,962
I never heard of these guys, shocking
as that may be. "Geronimo Jackson."

354
00:27:27,102 --> 00:27:30,086
This looks sweet.
Let's give her a rip.

355
00:27:30,612 --> 00:27:31,494
Yeah.

356
00:27:36,368 --> 00:27:39,635
So what do you think's the
story with that Libby chick?

357
00:27:39,742 --> 00:27:41,157
The story?

358
00:27:41,287 --> 00:27:43,218
She's kind of cute, right?

359
00:27:43,933 --> 00:27:45,019
You know, in a

360
00:27:45,113 --> 00:27:48,902
"I've been terrorized by the
others for 40 days" kind of way.

361
00:27:49,107 --> 00:27:51,733
Yeah, there is that.

362
00:27:56,015 --> 00:27:59,184
I think I have a
chance with her.

363
00:27:59,275 --> 00:28:01,575
I mean,
it's a classic desert island scenario.

364
00:28:01,601 --> 00:28:04,323
If I ever had a shot,
this is it.

365
00:28:08,150 --> 00:28:10,784
You  think Claire's
missed me yet?

366
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:14,532
Dude, it's been a day.

367
00:28:23,598 --> 00:28:26,041
This music is quite depressing.

368
00:28:26,162 --> 00:28:29,589
We can change it, dude.
You ever hear of Geronimo Jackson?

369
00:28:29,728 --> 00:28:32,334
I'm afraid not.
Where's Jack and Locke?

370
00:28:32,487 --> 00:28:34,127
Oh, they went after Michael.

371
00:28:34,829 --> 00:28:37,609
Michael? Yeah,
he's run after Walt again.

372
00:28:37,683 --> 00:28:39,532
Everyone's gone to
bring him back.

373
00:28:39,694 --> 00:28:40,977
Who's everyone?

374
00:28:41,088 --> 00:28:44,087
Everyone-- Jack, Sawyer, Locke.

375
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:45,899
Oh, and Kate.

376
00:28:50,644 --> 00:28:55,498
Just sit down, Jack.
Nobody gonna hurt you. I come in peace.

377
00:28:55,888 --> 00:28:57,982
How do you know our names?

378
00:28:58,412 --> 00:28:59,915
You took Walt.

379
00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:03,183
Walt's fine.

380
00:29:03,399 --> 00:29:05,879
He's a very special boy.

381
00:29:06,037 --> 00:29:09,654
Look, you said you
wanted to talk. Talk.

382
00:29:10,142 --> 00:29:13,204
Let me ask you this--
how long you been here on the island?

383
00:29:14,548 --> 00:29:15,762
50 days.

384
00:29:16,034 --> 00:29:20,196
Ooh, 50 days.
That's, what, almost two whole months.

385
00:29:21,579 --> 00:29:26,012
Tell me, you go over a man's
house for the first time,

386
00:29:26,570 --> 00:29:29,552
do you take off your shoes?

387
00:29:29,654 --> 00:29:32,291
Do you put your feet up
on his coffee table?

388
00:29:33,021 --> 00:29:36,751
Do you walk in the kitchen and eat
food that doesn't belong to you,

389
00:29:36,911 --> 00:29:40,149
open the door to rooms you
got no business opening?

390
00:29:42,729 --> 00:29:46,847
You know, somebody a whole lot smarter
than anybody here once said that,

391
00:29:46,926 --> 00:29:54,102
"since the dawn of our species,
man has been blessed with curiosity."

392
00:29:54,301 --> 00:29:58,178
You know the other one about curiosity,
don't you, Jack?

393
00:30:00,824 --> 00:30:03,391
This is not your island.

394
00:30:03,578 --> 00:30:05,840
This is our island.

395
00:30:05,952 --> 00:30:08,422
And the only reason
you're living on it

396
00:30:08,597 --> 00:30:11,431
is 'cause we let
you live on it.

397
00:30:15,809 --> 00:30:17,326
I don't believe you.

398
00:30:19,521 --> 00:30:21,043
You don't believe what?

399
00:30:21,225 --> 00:30:24,913
I think you've got one
guy up there with a gun.

400
00:30:25,030 --> 00:30:28,181
I think there's more of
us than there are of you.

401
00:30:28,358 --> 00:30:30,769
I think if you had
any real strength,

402
00:30:30,876 --> 00:30:33,515
you wouldn't have
had to send a spy.

403
00:30:34,704 --> 00:30:36,610
Ethan.

404
00:30:40,810 --> 00:30:43,404
That's an interesting theory.

405
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:45,559
Light 'em up!

406
00:30:50,502 --> 00:30:52,761
We got a
misunderstanding, Jack...

407
00:30:52,852 --> 00:30:55,231
your people, my people.

408
00:30:55,312 --> 00:30:57,343
So listen carefully.

409
00:30:57,491 --> 00:31:00,545
Right here there's a line.

410
00:31:01,134 --> 00:31:05,713
You cross that line,
we go from misunderstanding to...

411
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:07,237
something else.

412
00:31:08,903 --> 00:31:13,921
Now give me your weapons, turn around.
Go home.

413
00:31:14,281 --> 00:31:15,703
No.

414
00:31:16,823 --> 00:31:19,009
- Jack, maybe--
- No!

415
00:31:21,767 --> 00:31:24,631
I hoped it wouldn't
come to this.

416
00:31:24,713 --> 00:31:26,701
Bring her out, Alex!

417
00:31:32,222 --> 00:31:34,472
She was following you.

418
00:31:34,644 --> 00:31:37,756
Like I said-- curiosity.

419
00:31:41,836 --> 00:31:43,278
Don't.

420
00:31:46,430 --> 00:31:50,229
Jack, the decision you gotta
make right now is this--

421
00:31:51,061 --> 00:31:55,959
Can you live with the fact that I shot
this woman right in front of you...

422
00:31:56,486 --> 00:32:01,492
When you could have saved her
life by giving up and going home?

423
00:32:02,402 --> 00:32:06,729
Now you gonna give me your guns,
turn around and walk away.

424
00:32:07,099 --> 00:32:09,702
It's your call, Jack.

425
00:32:10,326 --> 00:32:12,421
If you touched a hair
on her head, I'll--

426
00:32:12,436 --> 00:32:13,387
Shut up!

427
00:32:16,878 --> 00:32:19,332
I'm gonna count to three.

428
00:32:20,470 --> 00:32:21,606
One.

429
00:32:25,506 --> 00:32:26,696
two.

430
00:32:28,558 --> 00:32:29,786
Stop.

431
00:32:51,151 --> 00:32:52,589
Now them.

432
00:32:59,510 --> 00:33:01,331
Give me the other one, too.

433
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:23,756
You and me ain't done, Zeke.

434
00:33:55,537 --> 00:33:57,270
Jack, I...

435
00:33:59,283 --> 00:34:05,134
- You all right?
- Yeah.

436
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:24,390
*What are you you
doing out here alone?

437
00:34:25,251 --> 00:34:27,055
*I couldn't sleep.

438
00:34:28,736 --> 00:34:30,637
*Are they back?

439
00:34:30,883 --> 00:34:31,892
*Not yet.

440
00:34:36,612 --> 00:34:37,670
*Honey...

441
00:34:39,554 --> 00:34:43,092
*I don't like being
told what to do.

442
00:34:45,690 --> 00:34:50,720
*Being told what to do was
my life for four years...

443
00:34:52,917 --> 00:34:56,293
*I didn't like it much either.

444
00:35:00,082 --> 00:35:01,537
*Right.

445
00:35:03,373 --> 00:35:06,476
*I don't suppose you did.

446
00:35:37,693 --> 00:35:39,882
I was just trying
to help, Jack.

447
00:35:40,299 --> 00:35:43,019
When you told me not to go,
I just...

448
00:35:44,180 --> 00:35:46,171
I made a mistake.

449
00:35:48,181 --> 00:35:52,919
Hey. Could you just talk
to me for a second?

450
00:35:57,135 --> 00:35:58,456
I'm sorry.

451
00:36:00,574 --> 00:36:01,947
Yeah.

452
00:36:03,032 --> 00:36:04,887
I'm sorry, too.

453
00:36:23,816 --> 00:36:25,715
- Hey.
- Hey.

454
00:36:25,875 --> 00:36:27,393
How did it go?

455
00:36:29,170 --> 00:36:31,112
He died.

456
00:36:32,589 --> 00:36:34,017
I'm sorry.

457
00:36:34,340 --> 00:36:36,991
Yeah. Me too.

458
00:36:38,215 --> 00:36:41,052
- Who was over?
- My mom.

459
00:36:41,717 --> 00:36:44,245
Her bridge game okay?

460
00:36:44,805 --> 00:36:47,238
Oh, yeah. She's on a streak.

461
00:36:48,048 --> 00:36:50,049
Did you-- did you eat?

462
00:36:50,228 --> 00:36:52,761
Yeah. No, I--it's...

463
00:36:53,356 --> 00:36:55,581
it's late. I'm fine.

464
00:37:03,012 --> 00:37:04,342
You don't have to do that.

465
00:37:04,524 --> 00:37:08,095
It's therapeutic.
Cheaper than a shrink.

466
00:37:18,986 --> 00:37:21,515
How'd the daughter take it?

467
00:37:22,487 --> 00:37:24,440
What's her name-- Gabriela?

468
00:37:25,187 --> 00:37:26,638
She kissed me.

469
00:37:31,272 --> 00:37:33,117
Yeah, she...

470
00:37:34,297 --> 00:37:37,213
she kissed me, and...

471
00:37:37,894 --> 00:37:39,347
I kissed her back.

472
00:37:40,796 --> 00:37:46,303
I... I don't know.
I don't know how it happened. I just...

473
00:37:47,791 --> 00:37:49,793
I made a mistake.

474
00:37:50,454 --> 00:37:52,894
I made a mistake,
and this is my fault.

475
00:37:53,056 --> 00:37:54,730
It's my fault that you and me--

476
00:37:55,831 --> 00:37:59,820
I haven't been here, Sarah.
I mean...

477
00:38:01,566 --> 00:38:04,004
We don't even talk anymore.

478
00:38:05,777 --> 00:38:08,393
I hate what's
happening to us, and

479
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:10,896
I promise you that things
are gonna be different.

480
00:38:10,926 --> 00:38:13,279
I'm gonna--
I'm gonna work less.

481
00:38:13,539 --> 00:38:15,761
I'm gonna be here for you.

482
00:38:16,227 --> 00:38:18,937
Okay? I'm gonna fix this. We're
gonna go back to the way things were.

483
00:38:18,967 --> 00:38:21,965
I'm gonna fix this.
I'm gonna fix this.

484
00:38:30,145 --> 00:38:30,862
Jack.

485
00:38:32,247 --> 00:38:33,175
Jack...

486
00:38:39,459 --> 00:38:45,370
- I'm leaving you.
- What?

487
00:38:47,005 --> 00:38:48,386
I was already leaving you.

488
00:38:48,565 --> 00:38:51,901
That's why my mother was here.
She was helping me pack.

489
00:39:06,856 --> 00:39:11,167
I've been seeing someone...

490
00:39:16,250 --> 00:39:18,625
someone else.

491
00:39:22,075 --> 00:39:23,853
I have to...

492
00:39:24,886 --> 00:39:26,656
I can't stay.

493
00:39:29,353 --> 00:39:31,017
Sarah...

494
00:39:31,509 --> 00:39:32,636
You...

495
00:39:35,588 --> 00:39:40,979
you will always need
something to fix.

496
00:39:44,813 --> 00:39:46,025
Good-bye.

497
00:40:09,431 --> 00:40:10,541
See you, James.

498
00:40:15,451 --> 00:40:17,647
Don't beat yourself
up, Freckles.

499
00:40:18,141 --> 00:40:21,441
If he'd told me to stay behind,
I'd have done the same damn thing.

500
00:40:26,668 --> 00:40:28,115
Oh. Hello.

501
00:40:28,322 --> 00:40:29,515
What's the matter?

502
00:40:29,692 --> 00:40:31,618
What's the matter with
your little foot?

503
00:40:31,648 --> 00:40:33,016
Hi. Hi!

504
00:40:33,195 --> 00:40:34,768
Who's that?

505
00:40:36,063 --> 00:40:38,268
You don't like
your uncle Johnny?

506
00:40:39,277 --> 00:40:42,277
What is he doing to your toy?

507
00:40:42,561 --> 00:40:44,027
What is he doing?

508
00:40:48,014 --> 00:40:50,006
Hey, go away.

509
00:40:50,587 --> 00:40:53,407
I barely have enough
food to feed myself.

510
00:40:53,921 --> 00:40:56,195
Here. Get that. Go!

511
00:40:58,350 --> 00:41:00,377
I see you found a new friend.

512
00:41:01,967 --> 00:41:03,174
Progress.

513
00:41:09,475 --> 00:41:12,224
Hear you were out
lookin' for Michael.

514
00:41:14,084 --> 00:41:15,411
Yeah.

515
00:41:18,192 --> 00:41:20,786
He ran off looking
for his kid again?

516
00:41:29,714 --> 00:41:32,435
Not much you can do
about that then.

517
00:41:36,358 --> 00:41:39,203
Is it true that you
killed one of them?

518
00:41:40,137 --> 00:41:42,006
One of who?

519
00:41:42,909 --> 00:41:43,989
Them.

520
00:41:49,666 --> 00:41:52,625
Sayid tells me
that you're a cop.

521
00:41:55,140 --> 00:41:57,227
I was a cop.

522
00:41:58,137 --> 00:42:00,072
Can I ask you something?

523
00:42:00,672 --> 00:42:01,840
Shoot.

524
00:42:04,370 --> 00:42:07,885
How long do you think it
would take to train an army?
