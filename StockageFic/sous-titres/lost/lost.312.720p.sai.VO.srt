00:00:00,054 --> 00:00:01,598
<i>Previously on </i>Lost...

2
00:00:01,752 --> 00:00:03,141
I don't care what Jack said.

3
00:00:03,218 --> 00:00:05,765
They've got him.
We have to get him back. I owe him that.

4
00:00:06,295 --> 00:00:08,413
The man in the house.
You said you seen him before?

5
00:00:08,422 --> 00:00:10,269
On the video feed
from the pearl station.

6
00:00:10,394 --> 00:00:12,883
Why are we continuing
to play this little game,

7
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:15,516
when we all know
it has moved to the next stage?

8
00:00:19,586 --> 00:00:21,776
This is a map
showing electrical and data cabling

9
00:00:21,936 --> 00:00:23,637
comprised of houses and dormitories.

10
00:00:23,753 --> 00:00:25,673
Sounds like a place well worth visiting.

11
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:28,668
I saw a lightning hit the roof.

12
00:00:29,054 --> 00:00:30,346
You were electrocuted.

13
00:00:30,443 --> 00:00:33,434
And when you heard Claire was in
the water, you drown trying to save her.

14
00:00:33,472 --> 00:00:35,209
I dove in myself so you never went in.

15
00:00:35,324 --> 00:00:37,929
I'm trying pal,
I tried twice to save you, but...

16
00:00:38,054 --> 00:00:39,597
no matter what I try to do...

17
00:00:39,829 --> 00:00:41,449
you gonna die Charlie.

18
00:01:30,743 --> 00:01:31,804
Mom!

19
00:01:48,763 --> 00:01:50,172
Oh look, Aaron!

20
00:01:50,287 --> 00:01:52,795
Your mom has finaly decided to wake up.

21
00:01:57,223 --> 00:01:58,988
The only way I could get you to sleep in

22
00:01:59,191 --> 00:02:00,638
was to borrow the midget.

23
00:02:02,876 --> 00:02:04,936
And, what is all this?

24
00:02:05,071 --> 00:02:09,106
An aperitive,
of mysterious island fruit.

25
00:02:09,538 --> 00:02:11,446
Before the breakfast picnic

26
00:02:11,561 --> 00:02:13,914
I have set up in your honor

27
00:02:14,642 --> 00:02:16,191
a short walk down the beach.

28
00:02:16,947 --> 00:02:18,510
What's gotten into you, Charlie?

29
00:02:18,731 --> 00:02:19,734
Sorry?

30
00:02:19,755 --> 00:02:21,661
It's just, you've been
so depressed all week,

31
00:02:21,725 --> 00:02:25,688
and now it's breakfast in bed
and picnics?

32
00:02:25,829 --> 00:02:27,430
I woke up this morning, and I thought,

33
00:02:27,449 --> 00:02:30,643
it's time to stop feeling sorry
for yourself and seize the day,

34
00:02:30,755 --> 00:02:32,627
and I can't think
of anyone I'd rather do

35
00:02:32,704 --> 00:02:35,656
some day-seizing with than you.

36
00:02:37,732 --> 00:02:39,406
So... What do you say?

37
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:43,177
Let's drop
the cherub off with auntie Sun

38
00:02:43,529 --> 00:02:46,640
and uncle Jin, and you and I

39
00:02:47,684 --> 00:02:48,961
go for a little stroll.

40
00:02:50,038 --> 00:02:51,038
I would love to.

41
00:02:54,103 --> 00:02:55,453
From the position of this stream,

42
00:02:55,472 --> 00:02:58,544
we should be here,
and if the scale is right,

43
00:02:59,104 --> 00:03:01,381
his people
are 2 miles in that direction.

44
00:03:03,708 --> 00:03:05,652
I don't expect you to confirm that.

45
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:12,031
It's an electrical wiring map, Sayid.

46
00:03:12,124 --> 00:03:13,923
I'm not sure
it's as accurate as you think.

47
00:03:13,924 --> 00:03:17,247
Well, it's certainly not as infallible
as the magical carvings on your stick.

48
00:03:17,278 --> 00:03:19,516
Hey, the stick
didget us to that station.

49
00:03:19,583 --> 00:03:22,192
Oh, the station which
you accidentally blew up.

50
00:03:22,251 --> 00:03:24,972
If you'd have warned me
that the basement was rigged with C-4,

51
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:26,814
I might've been a little more careful.

52
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:34,712
Why don't you just tell us
if we're going the right way?

53
00:03:35,408 --> 00:03:36,908
You're going the right way.

54
00:03:37,109 --> 00:03:38,759
Remind me why we're keeping him alive.

55
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,602
What do you suggest,
we shoot him like a dog?

56
00:03:40,622 --> 00:03:42,435
No. I like dogs.

57
00:03:42,615 --> 00:03:45,948
He's right. They would not trade
his life for your friend's.

58
00:03:46,321 --> 00:03:47,892
- We should shoot him.
- Enough!

59
00:03:48,006 --> 00:03:49,519
Nobody's shooting anybody.

60
00:03:50,327 --> 00:03:52,827
The map says where they are,
and he says the map is right,

61
00:03:53,078 --> 00:03:54,390
so just keep moving.

62
00:04:01,471 --> 00:04:03,412
Okay, here we are, here we are.

63
00:04:04,948 --> 00:04:05,948
Not bad, eh?

64
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:07,149
Not bad at all.

65
00:04:08,014 --> 00:04:10,005
Well, if you'll take your seat,

66
00:04:10,043 --> 00:04:15,060
we will begin with our first course,
which is cereal.

67
00:04:15,636 --> 00:04:17,932
- We have fresh fruit salad--
- Good morning.

68
00:04:19,547 --> 00:04:22,278
Good morning yourself.

69
00:04:23,405 --> 00:04:24,915
What brings you down to the beach?

70
00:04:24,975 --> 00:04:26,094
Boar are running thick.

71
00:04:26,317 --> 00:04:29,039
I was hoping you might
want to join me on a hunt.

72
00:04:30,221 --> 00:04:31,551
Oh. Well...

73
00:04:32,775 --> 00:04:34,481
Thanks for the invite, but...

74
00:04:34,932 --> 00:04:38,408
as you can see,
we're just about to begin a picnic.

75
00:04:38,505 --> 00:04:40,627
Well, I think hunting might be a...

76
00:04:41,167 --> 00:04:43,328
a better way to spend your day, Charlie.

77
00:04:43,963 --> 00:04:46,683
I mean, of all the things
you could choose to do today,

78
00:04:46,845 --> 00:04:48,702
hunting with me might be
your best option.

79
00:04:48,759 --> 00:04:51,518
Oh, my God.

80
00:04:51,979 --> 00:04:52,982
What is it?

81
00:04:53,021 --> 00:04:55,084
I think I know
how to get us off this island.

82
00:05:09,668 --> 00:05:21,384
Subtitles: swsub.com

83
00:05:26,387 --> 00:05:27,831
Claire, what's the matter?

84
00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:29,920
I need Jin's nets and fish.

85
00:05:30,143 --> 00:05:32,688
We've gotta hurry. And buckets...
I'm gonna need those, too.

86
00:05:33,675 --> 00:05:35,682
- We have to catch the birds.
- What birds?

87
00:05:35,702 --> 00:05:38,031
They just flew over, and they're
only gonna be here today,

88
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:39,647
so to catch one, we need to do it now.

89
00:05:39,648 --> 00:05:41,036
Oh, this sounds like fun.

90
00:05:42,450 --> 00:05:43,528
Can you get some nets?

91
00:05:43,547 --> 00:05:45,013
Nets for what, Barb...

92
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:49,871
Nets for what, Claire?

93
00:05:50,910 --> 00:05:54,369
Okay, five minutes ago,
a flock of sea birds flew over my head.

94
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:57,927
Seabirds are migratory, which means
they're gonna keep heading south.

95
00:05:59,276 --> 00:06:01,275
I'm sorry. I don't understand
why we need to...

96
00:06:01,371 --> 00:06:02,393
They're tagged.

97
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:03,479
Tagged?

98
00:06:04,131 --> 00:06:06,571
Scientists tag these birds
so they can track them.

99
00:06:06,648 --> 00:06:10,311
So when they eventually land
in Australia or New Zealand or wherever,

100
00:06:11,024 --> 00:06:12,664
somebody's gonna gather them up.

101
00:06:14,545 --> 00:06:15,947
We can send a message.

102
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:17,361
If we can catch one.

103
00:06:17,498 --> 00:06:18,551
Okay, so here's the plan.

104
00:06:18,552 --> 00:06:20,522
First, we've gotta cut up
these fish, make chum.

105
00:06:20,541 --> 00:06:22,374
That'll get the birds
to settle in the water.

106
00:06:22,410 --> 00:06:25,419
And then, um, we're gonna need
to cut up some of this net.

107
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,568
Charlie, can you go get some knives?

108
00:06:35,907 --> 00:06:38,484
How do you even know
this stuff about birds?

109
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:41,258
I watched a lot of nature shows
with my mum.

110
00:06:41,296 --> 00:06:43,129
Doesn't exactly make you an expert.

111
00:06:44,742 --> 00:06:48,704
I just-- I don't want to see you
wasting your time, that's all.

112
00:06:51,249 --> 00:06:53,387
So what happened to seizing the day?

113
00:06:56,607 --> 00:06:57,607
Sorry.

114
00:06:58,962 --> 00:07:00,073
Don't see the point.

115
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:15,801
Hold still, dear. Just another second.

116
00:07:17,487 --> 00:07:18,487
There.

117
00:07:19,291 --> 00:07:20,291
We're through now.

118
00:07:25,902 --> 00:07:27,790
Ms. Littleton, I'm Officer Barnes.

119
00:07:28,004 --> 00:07:30,806
Sorry to bother you,
but I need to ask you a few questions.

120
00:07:30,910 --> 00:07:33,132
Can I ask you how the accident happened?

121
00:07:35,166 --> 00:07:37,162
A truck forced us off the road.

122
00:07:38,656 --> 00:07:40,758
Okay, and who was driving?

123
00:07:44,223 --> 00:07:45,303
Me.

124
00:07:47,771 --> 00:07:49,314
Has anyone contacted your father?

125
00:07:49,505 --> 00:07:50,991
My father died when I was 2.

126
00:07:51,338 --> 00:07:52,393
Sorry to hear that.

127
00:07:54,845 --> 00:07:56,376
I spoke with the truck driver.

128
00:07:56,443 --> 00:07:57,665
He's fine, by the way.

129
00:07:57,748 --> 00:08:00,600
- He said that when you hit him...
- No, he hit us.

130
00:08:01,702 --> 00:08:05,096
About what speed would you say
that happened when you were driving?

131
00:08:05,135 --> 00:08:06,580
It just came out of nowhere.

132
00:08:06,657 --> 00:08:08,927
That's not the question
I asked, Ms. Littleton.

133
00:08:10,214 --> 00:08:12,891
I don't know how fast I was driving.

134
00:08:14,167 --> 00:08:16,711
Why are you even asking me
these questions?

135
00:08:17,275 --> 00:08:20,113
These questions are standard procedure
when there's a fatality.

136
00:08:22,251 --> 00:08:23,891
My mother is in surgery.

137
00:08:24,785 --> 00:08:25,785
She's not dead.

138
00:08:26,572 --> 00:08:27,595
Right.

139
00:08:29,844 --> 00:08:30,844
So she is.

140
00:08:30,901 --> 00:08:32,623
You know, this is not my fault!

141
00:08:35,049 --> 00:08:36,049
Didn't say it was.

142
00:08:36,704 --> 00:08:37,910
Good day, Ms. Littleton.

143
00:08:52,462 --> 00:08:53,851
Can I ask you something?

144
00:09:06,396 --> 00:09:09,083
I told you that your daughter
was living with them...

145
00:09:11,755 --> 00:09:14,434
end you haven't asked me
a single question about her.

146
00:09:15,167 --> 00:09:17,723
- You haven't--
- Your friend Jack,

147
00:09:18,798 --> 00:09:19,924
you care about him?

148
00:09:22,769 --> 00:09:23,769
Yes.

149
00:09:25,198 --> 00:09:26,993
Imagine 16 years from now,

150
00:09:27,745 --> 00:09:29,096
you're told he's still alive.

151
00:09:29,981 --> 00:09:34,471
But in your heart,
you know that he wouldn't remember you.

152
00:09:35,087 --> 00:09:36,253
He wouldn't know you.

153
00:09:38,291 --> 00:09:41,608
Wouldn't even know
that you ever cared about him.

154
00:09:50,812 --> 00:09:53,223
I haven't asked you questions
about my daughter...

155
00:09:55,467 --> 00:09:57,724
because I do not want
to know the answers.

156
00:10:14,662 --> 00:10:15,744
Water?

157
00:10:16,196 --> 00:10:17,529
No, thank you.

158
00:10:19,403 --> 00:10:20,625
So how'd you get here?

159
00:10:21,266 --> 00:10:22,780
How'd you get onto this island?

160
00:10:22,843 --> 00:10:24,089
Don't waste your breath.

161
00:10:24,226 --> 00:10:25,962
Whatever he says will be a lie.

162
00:10:26,524 --> 00:10:28,434
I was recruited when I was 24.

163
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:31,668
- I was approached by a man...
- I didn't ask you when I asked you how.

164
00:10:32,671 --> 00:10:34,339
They brought me on the submarine.

165
00:10:34,923 --> 00:10:37,777
So your people, they can just come
and go whenever they want?

166
00:10:37,816 --> 00:10:38,930
Go, yes,

167
00:10:39,362 --> 00:10:41,438
but two weeks ago,
our underwater beacon

168
00:10:41,515 --> 00:10:43,267
stopped emitting its locator signal.

169
00:10:44,036 --> 00:10:47,146
There was an event...
an electromagnetic pulse.

170
00:10:47,592 --> 00:10:49,214
It would be impossible to come back.

171
00:10:49,293 --> 00:10:50,643
Why would you want to come back?

172
00:10:50,644 --> 00:10:52,032
You would not understand.

173
00:10:55,901 --> 00:10:56,901
Try me.

174
00:10:57,807 --> 00:10:58,807
I misspoke.

175
00:10:59,758 --> 00:11:03,188
What I mnt to say is,
you're not capable of understanding.

176
00:11:03,264 --> 00:11:04,622
And why am I not capable?

177
00:11:06,319 --> 00:11:08,096
Because you are not on the list.

178
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:11,935
What list?

179
00:11:16,684 --> 00:11:18,168
The man who brought me here,

180
00:11:18,323 --> 00:11:20,194
who brought all of my people here,

181
00:11:20,657 --> 00:11:23,406
he is... a magnificent man.

182
00:11:26,047 --> 00:11:27,405
If Ben's so magnificent,

183
00:11:27,421 --> 00:11:29,447
then why did he need one of us
to save him?

184
00:11:29,505 --> 00:11:31,617
Ben? Ben is not...

185
00:11:35,011 --> 00:11:37,399
I will try to make this
as simple as I can.

186
00:11:37,866 --> 00:11:40,588
You are not on the list
because you are flawed...

187
00:11:42,619 --> 00:11:43,952
Because you are angry...

188
00:11:46,027 --> 00:11:48,584
And weak and frightened.

189
00:11:49,626 --> 00:11:51,130
The more I learn about your people,

190
00:11:51,131 --> 00:11:54,423
the more I suspect you're not
as omniscient as you'd have us believe.

191
00:11:55,579 --> 00:11:57,547
Don't speak to us as if you know us.

192
00:11:57,893 --> 00:12:00,170
Of course I don't know you,
Sayid Jarrah.

193
00:12:00,748 --> 00:12:01,748
How could I?

194
00:12:03,707 --> 00:12:06,595
And you, Kate Austen,
are a complete stranger to me.

195
00:12:09,759 --> 00:12:11,130
But you, John Locke,

196
00:12:11,748 --> 00:12:15,259
you, I might have a fleeting memory of,
but I must be confused,

197
00:12:15,424 --> 00:12:17,646
because the John Locke
I know was para...

198
00:12:20,070 --> 00:12:21,373
Look at this.

199
00:12:27,479 --> 00:12:29,588
Over here. Come on.

200
00:13:14,129 --> 00:13:16,869
Well, looks like we're here.

201
00:13:23,848 --> 00:13:25,522
- Will this work?
- Yes.

202
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:27,478
Work.

203
00:13:37,351 --> 00:13:39,010
Please... Help.

204
00:13:49,093 --> 00:13:50,480
Smells great.

205
00:13:50,797 --> 00:13:52,074
Let's get it over with.

206
00:13:56,305 --> 00:13:58,082
This was my mother's worst fear.

207
00:13:58,810 --> 00:13:59,810
What do you mean?

208
00:13:59,911 --> 00:14:02,534
That I would end up
doing something very much like this,

209
00:14:02,612 --> 00:14:03,852
cutting bait.

210
00:14:04,013 --> 00:14:05,923
She had high hopes for my future.

211
00:14:07,168 --> 00:14:10,001
They did not include
me marrying a fisherman's son.

212
00:14:12,130 --> 00:14:15,423
Well, I guess we don't always turn out
like our mothers want.

213
00:14:15,784 --> 00:14:18,395
Of course,
mine never worked a day in her life.

214
00:14:23,895 --> 00:14:26,019
My mom was a librarian.

215
00:14:27,348 --> 00:14:28,348
Was?

216
00:14:35,019 --> 00:14:36,929
We should get this stuff out there.

217
00:14:58,618 --> 00:14:59,679
Where were you?

218
00:15:02,901 --> 00:15:04,512
I went home to take a shower.

219
00:15:05,502 --> 00:15:06,890
That must have been nice.

220
00:15:07,043 --> 00:15:08,902
They said she was still in surgery.

221
00:15:11,665 --> 00:15:13,850
I had glass in my hair, Aunt Lindsey.

222
00:15:14,322 --> 00:15:17,964
Well, I'm glad
that you're feeling refreshed.

223
00:15:21,829 --> 00:15:22,829
Good afternoon.

224
00:15:23,502 --> 00:15:24,679
Are you the daughter?

225
00:15:26,032 --> 00:15:27,976
I'm Dr. Woodruff from neurosurgery.

226
00:15:28,347 --> 00:15:30,458
I'll be observing your mother
for the next few days.

227
00:15:30,516 --> 00:15:31,538
How is she?

228
00:15:32,293 --> 00:15:34,587
We've managed to stabilize
her immediate injuries...

229
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,563
But your mother
suffered a severe head trauma.

230
00:15:39,461 --> 00:15:41,851
We'll have to wait for the swelling
in her brain to go down

231
00:15:41,909 --> 00:15:44,383
before we can determine
the full extent of her injuries.

232
00:15:46,613 --> 00:15:47,664
But...

233
00:15:48,409 --> 00:15:50,898
I'm afraid we're looking
at fairly widespread damage.

234
00:15:52,584 --> 00:15:53,865
What does that mean?

235
00:15:54,073 --> 00:15:57,410
It means that right now these machines
are sustaining her life.

236
00:15:59,730 --> 00:16:01,118
But it won't always be...

237
00:16:02,487 --> 00:16:04,039
I mean, when she wakes up, she won't...

238
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:06,159
I can't say with any real confidence

239
00:16:07,744 --> 00:16:08,855
that she will wake up.

240
00:16:25,368 --> 00:16:26,368
Can she hear us?

241
00:16:26,921 --> 00:16:28,254
I like to think she can.

242
00:16:28,924 --> 00:16:30,646
How long will she be like this?

243
00:16:31,335 --> 00:16:33,303
Could be a day, a week or years.

244
00:16:33,633 --> 00:16:35,410
We'll just have to wait and see.

245
00:16:36,389 --> 00:16:38,743
But I can assure you,
she'll be well looked after.

246
00:16:38,888 --> 00:16:40,433
Oh, that's very nice,

247
00:16:41,224 --> 00:16:42,594
but we can't pay for that.

248
00:16:42,652 --> 00:16:45,717
Don't worry. Her expenses
have already been taken care of.

249
00:16:51,104 --> 00:16:52,104
By whom?

250
00:16:52,922 --> 00:16:55,121
I've been asked
to keep that confidential.

251
00:17:18,503 --> 00:17:19,507
One...

252
00:17:20,641 --> 00:17:21,683
Two...

253
00:17:34,106 --> 00:17:35,186
Look, I'm sorry.

254
00:17:36,109 --> 00:17:37,132
I'm sorry, man.

255
00:17:38,256 --> 00:17:39,838
What the hell is wrong with you?

256
00:17:39,897 --> 00:17:42,592
I was shooting at a boar.
I had no idea you were out here.

257
00:17:42,775 --> 00:17:45,416
- Where's Charlie? Is he with you?
- He's back at the camp.

258
00:17:45,455 --> 00:17:47,864
- I'm really sorry if I frightened--
- So it's just you?

259
00:17:49,172 --> 00:17:50,644
- Aye, it's just me.
- Hunting,

260
00:17:50,837 --> 00:17:53,635
in the exact same spot
as we're setting our trap?

261
00:17:54,858 --> 00:17:56,768
I was following a boar, Claire.

262
00:17:57,902 --> 00:17:59,542
So it's just a coincidence, then.

263
00:18:01,058 --> 00:18:02,058
Where is it?

264
00:18:03,914 --> 00:18:04,914
It got away.

265
00:18:11,384 --> 00:18:13,676
You don't want me to catch the birds,
do you?

266
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:16,760
You and Charlie-- what's going on?

267
00:18:17,593 --> 00:18:19,482
Why wouldn't I want you
to catch the birds?

268
00:18:34,916 --> 00:18:35,916
What is it?

269
00:18:36,522 --> 00:18:37,522
Don't touch it!

270
00:18:37,972 --> 00:18:39,249
Don't even get near it.

271
00:18:45,487 --> 00:18:46,709
What are these pylons?

272
00:18:48,293 --> 00:18:49,874
What do you think they are?

273
00:18:53,293 --> 00:18:54,459
A security perimeter.

274
00:18:55,647 --> 00:18:57,980
Those sensors on the side
would be triggered

275
00:18:58,407 --> 00:19:00,073
if anyone passed between them.

276
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:06,359
It's an alarm system or a trap.

277
00:19:07,363 --> 00:19:09,391
Either way,
we'll be safer going around it.

278
00:19:09,568 --> 00:19:10,568
You are right.

279
00:19:10,918 --> 00:19:12,602
It was a security perimeter,

280
00:19:13,393 --> 00:19:16,477
but like everything else on this island,
it hasn't functioned in years.

281
00:19:16,627 --> 00:19:17,738
Of course it hasn't.

282
00:19:20,432 --> 00:19:22,503
If you wish
to waste your time, be my guest.

283
00:19:23,313 --> 00:19:25,435
The pylons encircle the entire barracks.

284
00:19:26,391 --> 00:19:27,880
There is no going around them.

285
00:19:28,788 --> 00:19:30,987
If you don't believe me,
look at your map.

286
00:19:44,118 --> 00:19:45,823
He appears to be telling the truth.

287
00:19:58,257 --> 00:19:59,280
Thank you.

288
00:20:23,707 --> 00:20:24,711
Oh, my god.

289
00:20:29,890 --> 00:20:30,890
Sorry.

290
00:20:43,987 --> 00:20:46,028
Looks like he suffered
a cerebral hemorrhage.

291
00:20:46,225 --> 00:20:48,097
Why did you do that? We needed him!

292
00:20:50,205 --> 00:20:51,864
They were never
gonna trade him for Jack.

293
00:20:51,865 --> 00:20:54,127
- You don't know that.
- You don't know it, either.

294
00:20:54,268 --> 00:20:57,136
What we do know
is that he shot one of his own people

295
00:20:57,194 --> 00:20:59,221
who didn't want to be
in this exact situation,

296
00:20:59,433 --> 00:21:02,121
- so I'm gonna stick with my opinion.
- We could have discussed it.

297
00:21:02,141 --> 00:21:04,925
Nobody asked me about it when
we brought him along in the 1st place.

298
00:21:04,926 --> 00:21:05,948
All right.

299
00:21:06,085 --> 00:21:11,494
Pardon me for not knowing
that they had a sonic weapon fence.

300
00:21:11,994 --> 00:21:14,315
I didn't know he was gonna die.
How would I know that?

301
00:21:14,748 --> 00:21:16,081
Why are you really here?

302
00:21:17,148 --> 00:21:18,370
Are you here for Jack?

303
00:21:19,758 --> 00:21:21,146
Why else would I be here?

304
00:21:22,983 --> 00:21:24,538
We'll talk about this later.

305
00:21:25,285 --> 00:21:26,285
Fine by me.

306
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:28,554
Just tell me
how we're gonna go through this.

307
00:21:28,593 --> 00:21:30,059
We're not gonna go through it.

308
00:21:30,111 --> 00:21:31,222
We're going over it.

309
00:21:33,371 --> 00:21:34,593
Sayid, where's the ax?

310
00:21:34,722 --> 00:21:35,722
It's in his pack.

311
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:37,271
No, wait a minute. I got it.

312
00:21:37,329 --> 00:21:38,329
Here, I got it.

313
00:21:50,001 --> 00:21:52,265
I thought
you didn't know there was any c-4.

314
00:21:53,652 --> 00:21:54,985
Well, I stand corrected.

315
00:21:56,202 --> 00:21:57,313
Why did you take it?

316
00:21:58,505 --> 00:22:01,096
You never know
when a little c-4 might come in handy.

317
00:22:02,462 --> 00:22:04,206
You'll have to do better than that.

318
00:22:14,775 --> 00:22:15,971
Okay, there you go.

319
00:22:18,131 --> 00:22:19,733
What's going on with you, Charlie?

320
00:22:20,594 --> 00:22:23,854
- I just put Aaron down
- No, you and Desmond,

321
00:22:23,993 --> 00:22:24,993
what's going on?

322
00:22:25,904 --> 00:22:28,433
- What you're talking about.
- So you don't know anything about

323
00:22:28,490 --> 00:22:30,786
Desmond shooting off his gun
and scaring away the birds?

324
00:22:31,955 --> 00:22:33,874
I've been with Aaron all morning.

325
00:22:33,907 --> 00:22:36,109
- You're lying to me, Charlie.
- I am not lying.

326
00:22:39,067 --> 00:22:41,341
What happened to the guy
who woke up this morning

327
00:22:41,551 --> 00:22:44,040
who wanted to go and have
a picnic and seize the day?

328
00:22:44,172 --> 00:22:46,060
You really want to know the truth?

329
00:22:47,378 --> 00:22:49,304
That glint you saw
could have been anything--

330
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:52,195
a piece of glass
stuck in the bird's foot...

331
00:22:52,384 --> 00:22:54,439
or it could have been nothing at all.

332
00:22:56,145 --> 00:22:59,256
I don't want to advocate false hope,
Claire, that's all.

333
00:23:01,246 --> 00:23:02,774
Well, I'm sorry

334
00:23:02,933 --> 00:23:06,141
I bothered you with my stupid ideas,
and, it won't ever happen again.

335
00:23:06,704 --> 00:23:08,969
And, Charlie,
I don't want my baby around lies.

336
00:23:09,096 --> 00:23:11,971
- I think you might be overreacting.
- Overreacting?

337
00:23:12,741 --> 00:23:15,762
No, I thought you were here for me,
that I could count on you.

338
00:23:16,192 --> 00:23:17,803
- I was wrong.
- No, Claire!

339
00:23:17,957 --> 00:23:20,692
I'm on my own,
and at least I know that now.

340
00:23:22,201 --> 00:23:23,416
Just go!

341
00:23:33,745 --> 00:23:34,745
Morning, dear.

342
00:23:35,047 --> 00:23:36,547
Oh, I like your new doctor.

343
00:23:37,048 --> 00:23:38,048
What new doctor?

344
00:23:38,202 --> 00:23:39,202
Oh, the American.

345
00:23:39,601 --> 00:23:41,045
He's in with your mum now.

346
00:23:55,875 --> 00:23:56,875
Excuse me.

347
00:24:05,328 --> 00:24:06,427
The nurse said...

348
00:24:08,605 --> 00:24:09,619
Are you a doctor?

349
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:12,830
Yes...

350
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:21,023
I'm very sorry. I shouldn't be...

351
00:24:21,642 --> 00:24:24,199
disturbing you. I was just leaving.

352
00:24:25,398 --> 00:24:26,894
What are you doing here?

353
00:24:27,754 --> 00:24:29,298
I was just on my way out, Lindsey.

354
00:24:29,447 --> 00:24:31,442
- If Carole knew you were here...
- She'd what?

355
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:35,412
What would she do?
She wouldn't be acting the way you are.

356
00:24:35,563 --> 00:24:36,843
Aunt Lindsey,

357
00:24:37,402 --> 00:24:39,226
what's going on here? Who is he?

358
00:24:41,169 --> 00:24:42,169
It doesn't matter.

359
00:24:42,724 --> 00:24:45,519
- Just go.
- Maybe you should tell her, Lindsey.

360
00:24:45,776 --> 00:24:48,629
- She deserves to know.
- Please, just leave us alone.

361
00:24:48,721 --> 00:24:50,998
You are not the arbiter here.

362
00:24:51,359 --> 00:24:53,538
- In these circumstances--
- You are taking advantage

363
00:24:53,539 --> 00:24:55,424
- of my sister's situation--
- I believe Claire

364
00:24:55,462 --> 00:24:57,259
- has every right to know--
- just stop it!

365
00:24:58,899 --> 00:25:00,838
Are you the one paying the bills?

366
00:25:01,207 --> 00:25:03,329
Are you the one taking care of all this?

367
00:25:07,012 --> 00:25:08,012
Yes.

368
00:25:15,251 --> 00:25:16,409
Then who are you?

369
00:25:23,266 --> 00:25:24,636
I'm your father, Claire.

370
00:26:00,372 --> 00:26:02,668
The system appears to fire a sonic pulse

371
00:26:03,138 --> 00:26:05,692
when an object
breaks the plane between two pylons.

372
00:26:05,808 --> 00:26:06,823
So...

373
00:26:07,902 --> 00:26:09,512
as long as we don't break the plane,

374
00:26:09,851 --> 00:26:11,295
we should remain unharmed.

375
00:26:11,402 --> 00:26:13,614
Why not just use
the plastic explosive you took?

376
00:26:13,706 --> 00:26:15,931
Be my guest.
You wanna go stick it on there?

377
00:26:16,553 --> 00:26:19,640
Whoever climbs over,
give those sensors a wide berth.

378
00:26:19,891 --> 00:26:21,107
I'll go first.

379
00:26:25,563 --> 00:26:26,662
Give me a hand.

380
00:27:28,264 --> 00:27:29,430
I guess I'll go next.

381
00:28:05,744 --> 00:28:06,843
Here you go.

382
00:28:07,670 --> 00:28:08,670
Thanks.

383
00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:14,145
You have every right to be upset.

384
00:28:14,232 --> 00:28:15,954
It just doesn't make any sense.

385
00:28:16,683 --> 00:28:18,960
Desmond's never gone
boar hunting before,

386
00:28:19,437 --> 00:28:21,458
and the boar
never come that close to the beach.

387
00:28:21,536 --> 00:28:23,772
Well, whatever is going on,

388
00:28:24,154 --> 00:28:25,938
they're still talking about it.

389
00:28:33,076 --> 00:28:34,076
Can you watch him?

390
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:36,028
What are you going to do?

391
00:28:38,734 --> 00:28:39,734
Get some answers.

392
00:28:46,898 --> 00:28:48,342
I'll be with you in a sec.

393
00:28:53,086 --> 00:28:54,205
There you go.

394
00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:56,279
It'll be 10 bucks.

395
00:29:08,247 --> 00:29:09,580
What are you doing here?

396
00:29:10,204 --> 00:29:11,537
Buy you a cup of coffee?

397
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:16,732
I have nothing to say to you.

398
00:29:17,716 --> 00:29:20,223
I'm leaving tonight,
then I'll be out of your life forever.

399
00:29:20,281 --> 00:29:22,731
Just one cup of coffee.

400
00:29:31,457 --> 00:29:32,595
So it's true.

401
00:29:34,778 --> 00:29:36,707
Yes, it's true.

402
00:29:43,496 --> 00:29:45,400
How'd you find out about the accident?

403
00:29:45,803 --> 00:29:47,773
A doctor friend here in Sydney told me.

404
00:29:47,851 --> 00:29:50,499
I got the call the minute your mother
went into surgery.

405
00:29:54,515 --> 00:29:56,449
Why did she tell me that you're dead?

406
00:29:58,475 --> 00:29:59,975
Well, because I--no doubt--

407
00:30:00,424 --> 00:30:02,816
left her
with so many wonderful memories.

408
00:30:06,029 --> 00:30:08,117
Look, we had a fling.

409
00:30:08,882 --> 00:30:11,225
I was back in Los Angeles
when she told me

410
00:30:11,371 --> 00:30:13,654
that she was pregnant,
that she was going to have the baby...

411
00:30:13,703 --> 00:30:15,294
- have you.
- You didn't--

412
00:30:16,104 --> 00:30:17,441
You didn't want to see me?

413
00:30:17,963 --> 00:30:20,635
No. I came out a bunch of times
when you were little.

414
00:30:21,851 --> 00:30:23,061
I stayed over,

415
00:30:24,238 --> 00:30:25,357
gave you toys.

416
00:30:26,158 --> 00:30:27,275
I sang to you.

417
00:30:30,476 --> 00:30:31,672
Why'd you stop coming?

418
00:30:34,171 --> 00:30:35,684
'cause your aunt hates me,

419
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:38,607
and your mother
didn't like the fact that I,

420
00:30:39,028 --> 00:30:40,194
I had another family.

421
00:30:41,532 --> 00:30:43,741
Why are you here now, then?
Why'd you come?

422
00:30:43,818 --> 00:30:46,230
You could've just paid her bills
from the states.

423
00:30:46,288 --> 00:30:49,071
I came over because I wanted to help.

424
00:30:49,493 --> 00:30:50,493
Help with what?

425
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:54,821
Your mother is alive...

426
00:30:57,706 --> 00:30:59,261
but she's not really living.

427
00:31:00,158 --> 00:31:01,423
What that's supposed to mean?

428
00:31:01,456 --> 00:31:04,012
It means that now may be the time

429
00:31:04,363 --> 00:31:07,817
to look at other alternatives,
other ways to relieve her pain.

430
00:31:08,573 --> 00:31:11,310
Now it is illegal
to turn off her machines,

431
00:31:11,373 --> 00:31:14,410
but I know of ways
that can achieve the same effect

432
00:31:14,482 --> 00:31:16,466
- without the legal consequences.
- Just stop it!

433
00:31:16,524 --> 00:31:18,813
- So...
You didn't come here to help me.

434
00:31:19,434 --> 00:31:22,006
You came here to try and fix
a mistake that you made.

435
00:31:22,021 --> 00:31:23,089
No, honey, that's not true.

436
00:31:23,090 --> 00:31:25,950
You think that just paying her bills
makes you noble or something?

437
00:31:27,347 --> 00:31:28,621
You come down here,

438
00:31:29,161 --> 00:31:30,726
and you try and get me to kill her?

439
00:31:35,357 --> 00:31:36,532
You know, just go.

440
00:31:37,010 --> 00:31:39,664
Why don't you just go?
Go back to your real family.

441
00:31:43,692 --> 00:31:44,811
You know...

442
00:31:46,957 --> 00:31:48,442
You might be my father...

443
00:31:51,496 --> 00:31:53,078
But I don't even know your name...

444
00:31:55,651 --> 00:31:58,500
And I, um, I want it to stay that way.

445
00:32:02,462 --> 00:32:03,561
Listen to me.

446
00:32:04,864 --> 00:32:08,000
Do not keep your mother alive
for the wrong reasons.

447
00:32:08,328 --> 00:32:11,188
Now there is hope and there is guilt,
and believe me,

448
00:32:12,146 --> 00:32:13,781
I know the difference.

449
00:32:22,238 --> 00:32:23,238
Good-bye, kiddo.

450
00:32:24,342 --> 00:32:25,897
It's great seeing you again.

451
00:33:09,568 --> 00:33:11,323
What the hell are you doing?

452
00:33:12,372 --> 00:33:13,372
You followed me.

453
00:33:16,226 --> 00:33:17,670
Stay back!

454
00:33:18,229 --> 00:33:19,451
It's one of the birds.

455
00:33:19,631 --> 00:33:20,631
Stay back!

456
00:33:39,566 --> 00:33:41,566
How did you know it was gonna be here?

457
00:33:41,661 --> 00:33:42,661
I didn't.

458
00:33:43,115 --> 00:33:44,115
Yes, you did.

459
00:33:44,667 --> 00:33:45,667
You had to.

460
00:33:46,418 --> 00:33:49,029
That's what you and Charlie
were arguing about.

461
00:33:50,926 --> 00:33:51,926
You knew.

462
00:33:53,683 --> 00:33:55,043
- How would I?
- I don't know,

463
00:33:55,081 --> 00:33:57,030
but you know,
you walked straight here...

464
00:33:57,937 --> 00:34:00,289
no doubt at all
about where you were going.

465
00:34:00,340 --> 00:34:03,407
You came right to this beach
and right to this rock,

466
00:34:04,391 --> 00:34:06,436
and low and behold, there's the bird.

467
00:34:09,202 --> 00:34:11,035
What t hell is going on, Desmond?

468
00:34:19,518 --> 00:34:20,906
See that spot over there?

469
00:34:25,878 --> 00:34:28,155
That's where Charlie slipped
and fell in.

470
00:34:29,497 --> 00:34:32,044
He got pounded again and again
by the rocks and...

471
00:34:33,385 --> 00:34:34,385
broke his neck.

472
00:34:35,891 --> 00:34:36,891
What?

473
00:34:37,593 --> 00:34:39,335
What--what are you talking about?

474
00:34:41,098 --> 00:34:42,542
That's where Charlie died.

475
00:34:59,159 --> 00:35:00,492
Look what Desmond found.

476
00:35:01,656 --> 00:35:02,656
How about that?

477
00:35:04,314 --> 00:35:05,369
It does have a tag.

478
00:35:06,116 --> 00:35:07,116
You were right.

479
00:35:12,723 --> 00:35:14,274
Desmond told me everything

480
00:35:18,036 --> 00:35:19,425
about all his visions...

481
00:35:21,436 --> 00:35:24,158
That he knew you were gonna get hit
by lightning,

482
00:35:27,265 --> 00:35:30,371
that you were gonna drown
trying to rescue me in the ocean...

483
00:35:35,856 --> 00:35:38,078
how you died trying to get me this bird.

484
00:35:39,261 --> 00:35:40,966
You don't believe all that, do you?

485
00:36:06,260 --> 00:36:08,068
Now who turned the telly off?

486
00:36:08,635 --> 00:36:11,375
Don't they know how much
you love your nature shows?

487
00:36:14,381 --> 00:36:15,381
That's better.

488
00:36:19,185 --> 00:36:20,629
So how are you today, mum?

489
00:36:22,190 --> 00:36:23,690
Did you have an okay night?

490
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:43,495
Something I have to tell you,

491
00:36:44,910 --> 00:36:47,572
something I should have told you
a long time ago.

492
00:36:56,036 --> 00:36:57,036
I'm pregnant.

493
00:37:04,598 --> 00:37:06,084
I'm giving it away.

494
00:37:08,857 --> 00:37:10,562
It's for the best.

495
00:37:17,869 --> 00:37:18,869
I wish...

496
00:37:25,372 --> 00:37:26,892
I don't know how you did it--

497
00:37:28,557 --> 00:37:29,946
raising me alone.

498
00:37:31,587 --> 00:37:33,142
That must have been so hard,

499
00:37:35,587 --> 00:37:36,726
and I was just...

500
00:37:37,809 --> 00:37:38,809
awful...

501
00:37:44,626 --> 00:37:45,771
So horrible to you.

502
00:37:52,176 --> 00:37:53,560
I'm so sorry, mum.

503
00:38:04,301 --> 00:38:07,948
So sorry for all the awful things
I said to you in the car...

504
00:38:10,904 --> 00:38:11,760
That...

505
00:38:13,441 --> 00:38:14,530
I hated you...

506
00:38:17,972 --> 00:38:19,824
and that I wished
you weren't my mother...

507
00:38:20,663 --> 00:38:22,592
and that I wished you were dead.

508
00:38:24,655 --> 00:38:26,083
It's all my fault--

509
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:28,581
the accident,

510
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:30,488
everything.

511
00:38:37,152 --> 00:38:38,812
I'm so sorry, mom.

512
00:38:52,716 --> 00:38:54,212
I'll see you soon, okay?

513
00:38:56,859 --> 00:38:58,614
"To whom it may concern,

514
00:38:58,926 --> 00:39:02,333
"we are survivors of Oceanic flight 815.

515
00:39:04,812 --> 00:39:07,537
"We have survived
on this island
for 80 days.

516
00:39:09,740 --> 00:39:11,141
"We were six hours into the flight

517
00:39:11,196 --> 00:39:12,856
"when the pilot said we were off course

518
00:39:12,894 --> 00:39:14,804
"and turned back towards Fiji.

519
00:39:17,453 --> 00:39:19,047
"We hit turbulence and crashed.

520
00:39:20,772 --> 00:39:23,206
"We've been waiting here all this time--

521
00:39:24,230 --> 00:39:26,429
"waiting for rescue that has not come.

522
00:39:27,969 --> 00:39:31,418
"We do not know where we are.
We only know you have not found us.

523
00:39:33,552 --> 00:39:36,067
"We've done our best
to live on this island.

524
00:39:36,279 --> 00:39:39,279
"Some of us have come
to accept we may never leave it.

525
00:39:42,299 --> 00:39:44,938
"Not all of us have survived
since the crash,

526
00:39:46,294 --> 00:39:48,224
"but there is new life, too,

527
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:51,002
"and with it, there is hope.

528
00:39:51,951 --> 00:39:53,384
"We are alive.

529
00:39:56,791 --> 00:39:58,564
