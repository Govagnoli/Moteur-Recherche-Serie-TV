00:00:00,582 --> 00:00:02,073
<i>Previously on</i> Lost...

2
00:00:02,132 --> 00:00:04,151
You want me to save your life?

3
00:00:04,210 --> 00:00:06,277
I want you to want to save my life.

4
00:00:06,406 --> 00:00:08,919
Just made a small incision
in Ben's kidney sac.

5
00:00:08,978 --> 00:00:12,213
Now if I don't stitch that back up
in the next hour, he's dead.

6
00:00:12,214 --> 00:00:14,032
I would like for you
to go back in there,

7
00:00:14,137 --> 00:00:16,068
put Ben under and finish the surgery.

8
00:00:16,069 --> 00:00:17,365
And why would I want to do that?

9
00:00:17,421 --> 00:00:20,248
Because I'm going to go
help your friends escape.

10
00:00:50,464 --> 00:00:52,015
What, you wanna turn steering?

11
00:00:52,682 --> 00:00:53,799
We have to go back.

12
00:00:53,882 --> 00:00:55,326
What the hell are you talking about?

13
00:00:55,491 --> 00:00:56,958
Turn the boat around, I mean it.

14
00:00:57,005 --> 00:00:58,789
Have you lost your mind?
We just got away.

15
00:00:58,790 --> 00:00:59,790
Just do it.

16
00:00:59,845 --> 00:01:03,300
- You give me one good reason to turn...
- Because we can't leave Jack behind.

17
00:01:09,263 --> 00:01:10,674
Yes, we can, Freckles...

18
00:01:11,718 --> 00:01:13,604
'cause that's what he asked us to do.

19
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:16,072
I mean, think about it…
We go back there,

20
00:01:16,285 --> 00:01:19,431
what do you think captain bunnykiller's
gonna do if he catches us?

21
00:01:19,894 --> 00:01:20,939
He'll kill you.

22
00:01:24,253 --> 00:01:26,135
God loves you as he loved Jacob.

23
00:01:31,967 --> 00:01:33,202
Thanks for the input.

24
00:01:35,421 --> 00:01:36,421
Sorry, kiddo...

25
00:01:39,077 --> 00:01:40,135
Jack's on his own.

26
00:01:43,737 --> 00:01:44,737
Time to get up.

27
00:01:46,491 --> 00:01:47,491
We're moving you.

28
00:01:50,690 --> 00:01:51,690
Moving me where?

29
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:53,085
Someplace else, Jack.

30
00:01:54,446 --> 00:01:55,446
Why?

31
00:02:01,807 --> 00:02:02,924
So this is it, huh?

32
00:02:03,664 --> 00:02:04,682
"It"?

33
00:02:04,752 --> 00:02:06,500
You just helped me save his life.

34
00:02:06,718 --> 00:02:08,056
If you're gonna kill me, please,

35
00:02:08,117 --> 00:02:11,228
at least show me the respect
of not calling it "moving."

36
00:02:12,002 --> 00:02:13,618
Now why would we kill you?

37
00:02:15,155 --> 00:02:16,741
Because you're done with me.

38
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:18,876
What kind of people do you think we are?

39
00:02:18,954 --> 00:02:20,258
I don't know, Tom.

40
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:24,200
The kind of people that would take
a pregnant woman...

41
00:02:24,387 --> 00:02:26,606
would hang Charlie from a tree...

42
00:02:27,066 --> 00:02:29,063
would drag our people
out of the jungle...

43
00:02:29,187 --> 00:02:30,843
would kidnap children…

44
00:02:32,403 --> 00:02:34,671
That's the kind of people
I think you are.

45
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:48,793
You see this glass house
you're living in, Jack?

46
00:02:50,384 --> 00:02:52,266
How 'bout I get you some stones?

47
00:02:58,973 --> 00:03:01,357
Let's do this the easy way.
What do you say?

48
00:03:47,671 --> 00:03:51,506
Sync by Sixe.

49
00:03:54,267 --> 00:03:58,430
www.swsub.com

50
00:04:17,049 --> 00:04:19,010
Dr. Jack? Hey, Dr. Jack?

51
00:04:20,183 --> 00:04:21,625
Dr. Jack want soda?

52
00:04:38,152 --> 00:04:40,649
You know I can't understand a word
you're saying, right?

53
00:04:44,754 --> 00:04:45,754
You're welcome.

54
00:05:57,856 --> 00:05:58,971
Thank you.

55
00:05:59,112 --> 00:06:00,381
Thank you very much.

56
00:06:00,713 --> 00:06:02,803
You're not from around here, are you?

57
00:06:05,874 --> 00:06:07,501
No. No, I'm not.

58
00:06:07,607 --> 00:06:09,403
I'm... Jack.

59
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:13,135
Hi, Jack. I'm Achara.

60
00:06:13,784 --> 00:06:14,784
Achara...

61
00:06:37,369 --> 00:06:39,060
Juliet grilled these for me.

62
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:42,931
Who's that woman?

63
00:06:44,103 --> 00:06:45,889
That'd be the sheriff.

64
00:06:47,051 --> 00:06:49,005
- You have a sheriff?
- Not literally.

65
00:06:49,059 --> 00:06:50,722
Why are you moving Juliet into my room?

66
00:06:50,898 --> 00:06:53,202
'Cause she's in trouble.

67
00:06:58,578 --> 00:07:00,152
Now don't try anything stupid.

68
00:07:00,281 --> 00:07:02,163
You stay put in this cage, okay?

69
00:07:02,251 --> 00:07:05,390
You say that like you're not watching me
from that camera right there.

70
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:06,985
Oh, right.

71
00:07:07,032 --> 00:07:10,036
Ben told me you got into
the surveillance room.

72
00:07:22,226 --> 00:07:23,583
Let me ask you something.

73
00:07:24,867 --> 00:07:27,121
You risk your neck to cut them loose,

74
00:07:27,278 --> 00:07:29,287
and they run away
and don't ever look back...

75
00:07:29,288 --> 00:07:30,699
Thanks for the sandwich.

76
00:07:40,926 --> 00:07:43,603
Never thought I'd be glad
to get back to this rock again.

77
00:07:43,758 --> 00:07:44,875
What are you doing?

78
00:07:45,408 --> 00:07:47,265
What's it look like?
I'm heading into shore.

79
00:07:47,266 --> 00:07:49,661
Why? If we just keep going,
we can circle round.

80
00:07:49,662 --> 00:07:52,620
Sooner or later we'll get to camp
and tell Locke and Sayid what happened.

81
00:07:52,621 --> 00:07:53,641
Oh, we will?

82
00:07:53,821 --> 00:07:56,271
You got a map you ain't showing me,
Magellan?

83
00:07:57,825 --> 00:08:00,932
We got no food, no water,
and I can't steer in the dark.

84
00:08:01,241 --> 00:08:02,380
Then I'll steer.

85
00:08:04,335 --> 00:08:06,155
You'll come ashore,
and we'll make camp.

86
00:08:08,944 --> 00:08:10,012
You want to contribute?

87
00:08:10,036 --> 00:08:12,142
You can build a campfire
while I carry the kid.

88
00:08:14,033 --> 00:08:15,132
Glad we agree.

89
00:08:29,117 --> 00:08:30,397
Sure you ain't hungry?

90
00:08:30,663 --> 00:08:32,192
No, James, I ain't hungry.

91
00:08:34,414 --> 00:08:35,590
You shouldn't fight.

92
00:08:37,170 --> 00:08:38,934
When the hell did you wake up?

93
00:08:39,626 --> 00:08:42,405
You shouldn't fight
because you're lucky to be alive.

94
00:08:44,028 --> 00:08:46,085
Golly! I think he's got a point!

95
00:08:49,845 --> 00:08:52,419
That island we were on...
Is that where your people live?

96
00:08:52,510 --> 00:08:53,591
Just where we work.

97
00:08:55,502 --> 00:08:56,502
Work on what?

98
00:08:56,952 --> 00:08:57,976
Projects.

99
00:08:58,011 --> 00:09:01,247
Oh, sure, like the "steal the kid
off the raft"
project?

100
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:03,095
That was a humdinger.

101
00:09:03,158 --> 00:09:05,307
So you don't actually live
on that island?

102
00:09:06,282 --> 00:09:07,346
Do you live here...

103
00:09:08,676 --> 00:09:09,709
on this island?

104
00:09:10,642 --> 00:09:11,642
Yes, ma'am.

105
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:18,653
And what did you do with the people
that you took...

106
00:09:19,053 --> 00:09:21,507
- the kids?
- We give them a better life.

107
00:09:21,572 --> 00:09:22,605
Better than what?

108
00:09:24,358 --> 00:09:25,439
Better than yours.

109
00:09:33,521 --> 00:09:35,624
There's not gonna be any moon tonight.

110
00:09:36,626 --> 00:09:37,626
It'll be dark.

111
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:40,682
Me and Alex used to lie in my backyard
at night,

112
00:09:40,761 --> 00:09:42,859
make up names for the constellations.

113
00:09:43,391 --> 00:09:44,406
You can't see it yet,

114
00:09:45,379 --> 00:09:47,774
but right there will be
"Ursa Theodorus"...

115
00:09:49,595 --> 00:09:50,595
the teddy bear.

116
00:09:51,295 --> 00:09:52,412
You have backyards?

117
00:09:57,008 --> 00:09:58,419
Well, ain't that quaint?

118
00:10:03,666 --> 00:10:04,699
<i>Warning!</i>

119
00:10:30,247 --> 00:10:31,456
I thought you were locked up.

120
00:10:31,516 --> 00:10:33,280
They let me out to examine Ben.

121
00:10:34,185 --> 00:10:36,400
His vitals are low, and he has a fever.

122
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:38,564
I took this about ten minutes ago.

123
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:39,902
It's of his stitches.

124
00:10:42,922 --> 00:10:44,567
They're infected, aren't they?

125
00:10:45,922 --> 00:10:48,023
- Yes.
- Will you come look at them?

126
00:10:51,352 --> 00:10:53,712
I'm not asking you for them... or him.

127
00:10:53,887 --> 00:10:56,298
I'm asking you as a personal favor
to me.

128
00:10:59,943 --> 00:11:02,569
You... want me to help him again?

129
00:11:03,189 --> 00:11:04,234
Yes.

130
00:11:05,152 --> 00:11:06,954
Are you sure about that, Juliet?

131
00:11:07,032 --> 00:11:09,275
Yes... I'm sure.

132
00:11:09,761 --> 00:11:13,356
And this is because he said
that he would let you go home?

133
00:11:20,969 --> 00:11:22,589
It's because I'm in trouble.

134
00:11:23,736 --> 00:11:25,881
- Trouble? For...
- I just killed someone.

135
00:11:26,086 --> 00:11:28,203
That's why they put me in your room.

136
00:11:28,584 --> 00:11:29,584
Who?

137
00:11:33,041 --> 00:11:34,163
It's complicated.

138
00:11:36,701 --> 00:11:38,995
Well, then, let me simplify it for you.

139
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:41,586
I'm not gonna help him...

140
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:46,058
and I'm not gonna help you.

141
00:12:08,090 --> 00:12:10,059
Special Thai dish for you. You try.

142
00:12:23,747 --> 00:12:26,013
Very brave, very brave.

143
00:12:29,628 --> 00:12:30,863
My brother likes you.

144
00:12:31,149 --> 00:12:33,145
Well, I'm a very likeable guy.

145
00:12:37,194 --> 00:12:38,194
So, Jack...

146
00:12:39,741 --> 00:12:40,969
tell me something.

147
00:12:41,968 --> 00:12:42,989
Shoot.

148
00:12:43,457 --> 00:12:45,809
Why is it you don't know
how to fly a kite?

149
00:12:48,112 --> 00:12:49,370
Just never learned, I guess.

150
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:50,482
That's very sad.

151
00:12:51,717 --> 00:12:53,362
Well, my dad worked a lot.

152
00:12:54,782 --> 00:12:57,583
He wasn't exactly the kite-flying type,
anyway.

153
00:12:57,729 --> 00:12:59,121
I mean, we never really...

154
00:13:00,832 --> 00:13:02,654
I have no interest in your father.

155
00:13:04,039 --> 00:13:05,048
Well, that's a relief,

156
00:13:05,095 --> 00:13:07,542
because I'm pretty tired
of talking about him.

157
00:13:07,652 --> 00:13:09,159
Some things are personal.

158
00:13:17,004 --> 00:13:20,564
So you're in Phuket to...
"find yourself"?

159
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:23,811
Why would you say that?

160
00:13:23,876 --> 00:13:25,015
You're an American.

161
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:47,680
I have... a gift.

162
00:13:49,215 --> 00:13:50,937
Must be one hell of a gift.

163
00:14:19,543 --> 00:14:21,644
I was just reading your tattoos.

164
00:14:22,318 --> 00:14:24,561
The "five" and the stars are very cute,

165
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:27,221
But the Chinese I find...

166
00:14:30,062 --> 00:14:31,062
a bit ironic.

167
00:14:32,422 --> 00:14:33,568
You find what ironic?

168
00:14:33,635 --> 00:14:34,691
What it says.

169
00:14:37,192 --> 00:14:38,589
You do know what it says?

170
00:14:41,383 --> 00:14:43,380
Yeah, I know what it says.

171
00:14:44,485 --> 00:14:45,485
Are you sure?

172
00:14:46,242 --> 00:14:48,634
Chinese is a very complicated language.

173
00:14:48,846 --> 00:14:52,036
It's fairly common for some things
to get lost in translation.

174
00:14:52,104 --> 00:14:53,280
I know what it says.

175
00:14:55,962 --> 00:14:57,031
All right, then.

176
00:15:03,444 --> 00:15:04,584
My name is Isabel.

177
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:08,132
If you'll come with me,

178
00:15:09,533 --> 00:15:12,412
I'd like to talk to you and ask you
a few questions.

179
00:15:25,714 --> 00:15:27,664
Why don't you check on your father,
sweetheart?

180
00:15:27,665 --> 00:15:29,194
I know he'd appreciate it.

181
00:15:43,342 --> 00:15:44,917
Please, have a seat, Jack.

182
00:15:45,784 --> 00:15:49,413
As you may have gathered,
we don't live on this little island.

183
00:15:49,496 --> 00:15:52,731
In fact, most of us
don't really even like coming here.

184
00:15:53,455 --> 00:15:55,454
There's been an incident
that I'm investigating,

185
00:15:55,455 --> 00:15:57,575
and I need to ask you some questions,

186
00:15:57,808 --> 00:16:00,616
so I was hoping you may help me clear up

187
00:16:01,133 --> 00:16:04,174
a few of the... inconsistencies.

188
00:16:05,573 --> 00:16:07,514
Now correct me if I'm wrong, Tom,

189
00:16:07,603 --> 00:16:10,603
but you said, in the midst
of a surgical procedure,

190
00:16:10,737 --> 00:16:12,887
Jack made several comments indicating

191
00:16:12,946 --> 00:16:15,900
that Juliet had asked him to kill Ben.

192
00:16:18,378 --> 00:16:19,934
Yeah. That's right.

193
00:16:20,324 --> 00:16:21,441
Is that true, Jack?

194
00:16:22,979 --> 00:16:24,888
Did Juliet ask you to kill Ben?

195
00:16:27,791 --> 00:16:29,085
The question's simple.

196
00:16:29,688 --> 00:16:31,511
Did Juliet ask you to kill Ben?

197
00:16:40,836 --> 00:16:42,057
No, I was lying.

198
00:16:43,185 --> 00:16:45,362
I would've done anything
to get my friends out,

199
00:16:45,427 --> 00:16:47,345
and turning you people
against each other

200
00:16:47,346 --> 00:16:49,244
was my best chance of creating chaos.

201
00:17:03,103 --> 00:17:05,216
Why are you lying for her, Jack?

202
00:17:17,421 --> 00:17:19,479
I'd like to go back to my cage now.

203
00:17:28,457 --> 00:17:29,607
Who's there?

204
00:17:32,271 --> 00:17:33,565
Who do you think?

205
00:17:45,189 --> 00:17:46,189
What time is it?

206
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,492
It's late.

207
00:17:56,353 --> 00:17:57,353
Salty.

208
00:17:57,410 --> 00:17:59,233
I went for a swim in the ocean.

209
00:17:59,856 --> 00:18:01,842
Washing the day off of you, huh?

210
00:18:05,144 --> 00:18:07,692
Is there something
you'd like to ask me, Jack?

211
00:18:07,975 --> 00:18:09,062
No, not at all.

212
00:18:10,329 --> 00:18:11,329
I mean...

213
00:18:11,879 --> 00:18:12,996
it might be nice...

214
00:18:13,928 --> 00:18:17,222
after a month of you coming and going
whenever you want,

215
00:18:17,481 --> 00:18:19,363
to find out something about you.

216
00:18:25,245 --> 00:18:29,127
There are things that happen here
that you could never understand.

217
00:18:38,125 --> 00:18:39,125
Like your gift?

218
00:18:41,277 --> 00:18:42,277
Yes...

219
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:44,288
like my gift.

220
00:19:07,938 --> 00:19:09,919
Are you having fun with me, Jack?

221
00:19:12,584 --> 00:19:13,584
Oh, yeah.

222
00:19:15,459 --> 00:19:16,999
Then stop ask questions.

223
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:18,491
Let's have fun.

224
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:41,481
What?

225
00:19:52,126 --> 00:19:53,131
Do I...

226
00:19:54,653 --> 00:19:55,653
do I know you?

227
00:19:59,103 --> 00:20:00,155
815. You're...

228
00:20:03,109 --> 00:20:04,520
you were the stewardess.

229
00:20:04,613 --> 00:20:05,613
Cindy.

230
00:20:09,585 --> 00:20:11,851
What are you doing here, with them?

231
00:20:11,938 --> 00:20:14,783
I thought you were taken.
You were... You were captured.

232
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:18,616
They're not... it's not that simple.

233
00:20:20,933 --> 00:20:22,388
What are they doing here right now?

234
00:20:22,389 --> 00:20:23,859
What are you doing here?!

235
00:20:25,941 --> 00:20:27,470
We're here to watch, Jack.

236
00:20:28,752 --> 00:20:29,752
Watch what?

237
00:20:33,806 --> 00:20:35,158
What is it, sweetheart?

238
00:20:39,650 --> 00:20:42,518
She... wants to know
how Ana Lucia's doing.

239
00:20:49,429 --> 00:20:51,601
- Are you serious?
- What?

240
00:20:51,671 --> 00:20:54,759
If you've got something to watch,
Cindy, go watch it!

241
00:21:27,996 --> 00:21:29,557
- What?
- Sawyer, wake up.

242
00:21:32,756 --> 00:21:33,756
He's gone.

243
00:21:34,753 --> 00:21:35,753
Karl's gone.

244
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:37,160
Where?

245
00:21:51,288 --> 00:21:52,357
I got it.

246
00:21:52,714 --> 00:21:53,817
No, let me talk to him.

247
00:21:53,864 --> 00:21:54,932
No, I got it.

248
00:21:55,937 --> 00:21:56,937
Boys only.

249
00:22:09,729 --> 00:22:11,275
What the hell was that for?

250
00:22:11,347 --> 00:22:12,486
So you'd cowboy up.

251
00:22:14,984 --> 00:22:16,271
Crying in the jungle.

252
00:22:17,037 --> 00:22:19,593
I thought you
people were supposed to be tough.

253
00:22:20,508 --> 00:22:21,595
I am tough.

254
00:22:23,855 --> 00:22:25,031
Sure you are, Bobby.

255
00:22:27,563 --> 00:22:29,033
Bobby? "The Brady bunch"?

256
00:22:30,802 --> 00:22:32,364
What the hell's "The Brady bunch"?

257
00:22:36,326 --> 00:22:37,636
Anyway, look...

258
00:22:42,433 --> 00:22:44,138
I’ve been with a lot of girls...

259
00:22:47,288 --> 00:22:49,170
some of them worth the trouble...

260
00:22:50,747 --> 00:22:51,747
some not.

261
00:22:53,846 --> 00:22:55,140
Every now and again...

262
00:22:56,101 --> 00:22:57,101
there's one...

263
00:23:03,625 --> 00:23:05,417
one you name dumb stars with.

264
00:23:11,489 --> 00:23:14,502
So this girl, Sally Slingshot...

265
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:15,924
Alex.

266
00:23:17,444 --> 00:23:18,444
You love her?

267
00:23:20,599 --> 00:23:21,716
More than anything.

268
00:23:24,743 --> 00:23:26,950
Then go back
to wherever the hell your...

269
00:23:27,830 --> 00:23:29,722
yards are, and get her back.

270
00:23:32,314 --> 00:23:36,059
If I get caught,
they'll kill me this time.

271
00:23:41,534 --> 00:23:42,614
Well...

272
00:23:43,576 --> 00:23:45,197
at least it'll be worth it.

273
00:24:04,845 --> 00:24:06,360
I wanna ask you something.

274
00:24:07,598 --> 00:24:10,377
They're not watching anymore,
so you can tell me the truth.

275
00:24:14,757 --> 00:24:15,757
Ben...

276
00:24:16,543 --> 00:24:18,029
Why'd you save his life?

277
00:24:19,579 --> 00:24:20,671
All this time...

278
00:24:20,710 --> 00:24:22,465
After all he did to you
and your people...

279
00:24:22,466 --> 00:24:23,642
you should hate him,

280
00:24:25,367 --> 00:24:26,955
But you still fixed him up,

281
00:24:27,772 --> 00:24:30,007
even after your friends got away. Why?

282
00:24:31,128 --> 00:24:32,408
You're his daughter.

283
00:24:34,734 --> 00:24:35,910
Answer the question.

284
00:24:35,985 --> 00:24:39,043
I'll answer your question
if you answer one of mine.

285
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:42,140
Where's Juliet?

286
00:24:42,296 --> 00:24:43,943
She's with the rest of them.

287
00:24:44,495 --> 00:24:46,318
They're gonna read her verdict.

288
00:24:46,809 --> 00:24:47,831
Her verdict?

289
00:24:47,854 --> 00:24:49,839
And we all know what it's gonna be.

290
00:24:50,762 --> 00:24:53,644
We're pretty strict
about killing one of our own.

291
00:24:56,372 --> 00:24:57,372
Eye for an eye.

292
00:24:57,683 --> 00:24:59,280
Who? Who did she kill?

293
00:24:59,530 --> 00:25:02,000
The man who was gonna murder
your friends.

294
00:25:09,095 --> 00:25:11,330
No wonder you're so worried about her.

295
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:15,211
If it wasn't for you,
she never would have done it.

296
00:25:16,219 --> 00:25:17,689
That was three questions.

297
00:25:19,008 --> 00:25:20,077
Your turn, Jack.

298
00:25:22,407 --> 00:25:24,955
I saved your father
because I said I would.

299
00:25:35,838 --> 00:25:37,132
Is he still in charge?

300
00:25:38,242 --> 00:25:39,846
- What?
- Ben, your father...

301
00:25:39,847 --> 00:25:41,045
Is he still in charge?

302
00:25:41,046 --> 00:25:42,903
Will that woman Isabel do what he says?

303
00:25:45,001 --> 00:25:46,412
Get me out of this cage.

304
00:25:51,042 --> 00:25:52,159
I wouldn't do that.

305
00:25:57,803 --> 00:26:00,036
The cavalry has arrived at last.

306
00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:15,647
I'd be much more impressed with you
people if you had a good surgeon.

307
00:26:19,444 --> 00:26:21,548
We had an excellent surgeon, Jack.

308
00:26:24,084 --> 00:26:25,387
His name was Ethan.

309
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:29,883
You have a very serious infection, Ben.

310
00:26:30,308 --> 00:26:33,484
That infected tissue
needs to be re-incised, debrided,

311
00:26:33,659 --> 00:26:37,129
and you need to be very closely
monitored from here on out.

312
00:26:38,669 --> 00:26:42,492
There might be nerve damage
or any number of other complications.

313
00:26:43,934 --> 00:26:45,404
You might not walk again.

314
00:26:47,513 --> 00:26:50,766
Your bedside manner
leaves something to be desired.

315
00:26:51,804 --> 00:26:54,355
Well, then,
it's too bad you're stuck with me.

316
00:26:56,499 --> 00:26:58,320
- Am I?
- You need a doctor,

317
00:26:59,365 --> 00:27:00,838
someone to stay with you

318
00:27:02,409 --> 00:27:04,135
bring you back to good health.

319
00:27:07,719 --> 00:27:09,909
And here we go again.

320
00:27:12,079 --> 00:27:14,944
I've already given you
a ticket off this island.

321
00:27:14,979 --> 00:27:17,089
What's it gonna cost me this time?

322
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:20,150
Right now your people are in a room

323
00:27:20,235 --> 00:27:23,454
deciding whether or not
to execute Juliet.

324
00:27:28,349 --> 00:27:29,584
You're gonna stop it.

325
00:27:31,208 --> 00:27:33,428
Juliet doesn't care about you, Jack.

326
00:27:35,465 --> 00:27:37,288
Doesn't matter what she's done,

327
00:27:38,626 --> 00:27:40,214
No matter what you think...

328
00:27:43,131 --> 00:27:44,406
she's one of us.

329
00:27:47,988 --> 00:27:50,320
Do we have a deal or not?

330
00:27:58,101 --> 00:27:59,816
Does Isabel have a walkie?

331
00:28:01,848 --> 00:28:03,398
They're already in the meeting.

332
00:28:10,723 --> 00:28:12,723
Then get me something to write on.

333
00:29:28,443 --> 00:29:29,554
You following me.

334
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,075
What is all this?

335
00:29:39,876 --> 00:29:42,699
This is where I work,
and you shouldn't be here.

336
00:29:47,186 --> 00:29:48,324
This is a...

337
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:50,840
a tattoo parlor.

338
00:29:50,892 --> 00:29:52,396
This was your big secret?

339
00:29:53,995 --> 00:29:56,515
The envelopes... your gift?

340
00:29:56,903 --> 00:29:58,777
I am not a tattoo artist.

341
00:30:06,073 --> 00:30:08,029
I'm able to see who people are.

342
00:30:09,584 --> 00:30:11,969
My work is not decoration...

343
00:30:12,835 --> 00:30:14,098
it is definition...

344
00:30:17,038 --> 00:30:18,038
and this...

345
00:30:19,041 --> 00:30:20,041
this is my gift.

346
00:30:21,703 --> 00:30:22,703
So...

347
00:30:24,049 --> 00:30:25,465
you see who people are.

348
00:30:26,121 --> 00:30:27,189
Yes...

349
00:30:27,898 --> 00:30:29,154
and I mark them.

350
00:30:33,324 --> 00:30:34,593
So tell me who I am.

351
00:30:36,724 --> 00:30:37,724
No.

352
00:30:39,175 --> 00:30:41,741
- Why not?
- You are an outsider.

353
00:30:41,910 --> 00:30:43,509
So you can sleep with me...

354
00:30:43,982 --> 00:30:44,982
I'm not allowed.

355
00:30:47,191 --> 00:30:49,024
Do you see who I am, Achara?

356
00:30:50,945 --> 00:30:51,945
Yes.

357
00:30:53,859 --> 00:30:54,859
Who am I?

358
00:30:55,356 --> 00:30:58,939
You are a leader, a great man.

359
00:31:00,862 --> 00:31:01,862
But this...

360
00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:06,431
this makes you lonely...

361
00:31:08,180 --> 00:31:09,180
and frightened..

362
00:31:11,135 --> 00:31:12,135
and angry.

363
00:31:22,046 --> 00:31:23,046
Good.

364
00:31:24,846 --> 00:31:26,045
Now put it on me.

365
00:31:28,456 --> 00:31:29,456
Put it on me.

366
00:31:30,555 --> 00:31:31,830
No. This...

367
00:31:32,965 --> 00:31:34,494
this is against my people.

368
00:31:45,584 --> 00:31:47,525
There will be consequences, Jack.

369
00:31:49,484 --> 00:31:50,484
There always are.

370
00:32:15,997 --> 00:32:17,194
Wait. No,

371
00:32:17,381 --> 00:32:18,685
you shouldn't be here.

372
00:32:18,828 --> 00:32:19,828
Just stand back.

373
00:32:20,507 --> 00:32:21,624
Don't say anything.

374
00:32:31,027 --> 00:32:32,060
Alex, you...

375
00:32:36,942 --> 00:32:39,102
What the hell
did you bring him here for?!

376
00:32:39,238 --> 00:32:40,278
Let him go, Tom.

377
00:32:42,695 --> 00:32:44,258
What's going on, Alex?

378
00:32:46,601 --> 00:32:47,601
This is from Ben.

379
00:32:57,375 --> 00:33:00,658
Ben has commuted Juliet's sentence.

380
00:33:01,217 --> 00:33:02,920
Execution is off the table.

381
00:33:03,365 --> 00:33:05,210
He says the rules don't apply.

382
00:33:08,750 --> 00:33:11,134
He has, however,
ordered her to be marked.

383
00:33:49,604 --> 00:33:50,839
Hey, where you going?

384
00:34:04,632 --> 00:34:05,632
Hey, I know you.

385
00:34:07,631 --> 00:34:09,219
I'm Achara's friend from...

386
00:34:10,385 --> 00:34:12,459
...Chet's. Jack from the restaurant.

387
00:34:18,042 --> 00:34:19,240
Let go of me, man.

388
00:34:43,450 --> 00:34:44,895
You will get off our beach!

389
00:34:45,044 --> 00:34:46,371
You leave this country!

390
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,103
Do you understand me?

391
00:35:52,159 --> 00:35:54,208
I heard you only liked them grilled.

392
00:35:57,209 --> 00:35:58,871
I missed the toothpicks, too.

393
00:36:09,479 --> 00:36:10,479
Let me see.

394
00:36:11,181 --> 00:36:12,256
They marked you.

395
00:36:12,581 --> 00:36:13,581
Let me see it.

396
00:36:35,676 --> 00:36:37,637
Break a branch off that aloe plant
over there...

397
00:36:38,127 --> 00:36:39,625
Please. Please do it.

398
00:36:56,999 --> 00:36:58,350
All right, turn around.

399
00:37:21,802 --> 00:37:22,978
Why did you help me?

400
00:37:24,304 --> 00:37:26,554
He told you he was gonna
let you go home.

401
00:37:27,214 --> 00:37:28,743
He told me the same thing.

402
00:37:30,161 --> 00:37:32,513
We're gonna make sure he keeps his word.

403
00:37:33,070 --> 00:37:34,952
And how are we going to do that?

404
00:37:35,771 --> 00:37:36,771
Together.

405
00:37:49,804 --> 00:37:52,904
They'll be coming for you
in a few minutes...

406
00:37:53,507 --> 00:37:54,507
All of them.

407
00:37:55,563 --> 00:37:57,210
Your friends know where we are,

408
00:37:57,290 --> 00:38:00,496
so we have to leave this island
to go back to where we live.

409
00:38:01,571 --> 00:38:02,571
Go where?

410
00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:05,949
Well, Ben calls it "home."

411
00:38:12,231 --> 00:38:13,231
Where's Karl?

412
00:38:14,036 --> 00:38:15,036
I let him go.

413
00:38:16,845 --> 00:38:18,548
- You what?
- I let him go.

414
00:38:19,364 --> 00:38:21,253
He could have led us back
to where they live.

415
00:38:21,254 --> 00:38:23,969
What, you think I cut him loose
'cause I'm so damn sensitive?

416
00:38:24,047 --> 00:38:25,263
The kid's a target.

417
00:38:27,704 --> 00:38:30,024
Ben ain't never gonna stop
looking for him, so as long…

418
00:38:30,064 --> 00:38:33,427
All Ben wants is that kid
as far from his daughter as possible.

419
00:38:34,664 --> 00:38:36,015
Let's get back to camp.

420
00:38:41,691 --> 00:38:43,031
Are you coming or not?

421
00:38:43,990 --> 00:38:46,872
Should I walk beside you
or ten paces behind you?

422
00:38:48,136 --> 00:38:49,769
You're so good at telling me what to do,

423
00:38:49,770 --> 00:38:51,096
I can't think for myself anymore.

424
00:38:51,097 --> 00:38:53,567
Don't take it out on me
'cause you feel guilty.

425
00:38:53,661 --> 00:38:54,753
I don't feel guilty.

426
00:38:54,806 --> 00:38:55,903
The hell you don't!

427
00:38:55,904 --> 00:38:57,195
We had to leave Jack behind.

428
00:38:57,215 --> 00:38:59,154
- I didn't have a choice...
- I'm not talking

429
00:38:59,155 --> 00:39:00,542
about leaving Jack behind.

430
00:39:05,781 --> 00:39:09,104
I'm talking about you and me.

431
00:39:16,837 --> 00:39:19,870
I know you did it 'cause you thought
I was a dead man...

432
00:39:20,815 --> 00:39:23,938
so don't beat yourself up
'cause the doc's left behind.

433
00:39:27,467 --> 00:39:28,996
I'm not beating myself up.

434
00:39:30,068 --> 00:39:31,185
'Course you're not.

435
00:39:37,833 --> 00:39:40,613
So now that we got that out of the way,
let's go.

436
00:40:06,638 --> 00:40:10,736
"He walks amongst us,
but he is not one of us."

437
00:40:11,823 --> 00:40:12,907
Your tattoos...

438
00:40:13,388 --> 00:40:14,711
That's what they say.

439
00:40:20,292 --> 00:40:21,527
That's what they say.

440
00:40:22,596 --> 00:40:24,007
It's not what they mean.
