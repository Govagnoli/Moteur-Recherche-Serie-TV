1
00:00:18,752 --> 00:00:20,310
Anything?

2
00:00:20,387 --> 00:00:22,446
You keep asking if there's anything.

3
00:00:22,522 --> 00:00:24,615
Pardon me for appearing desperate,

4
00:00:24,691 --> 00:00:27,421
but before the pilot was ripped
from the cockpit,

5
00:00:27,494 --> 00:00:32,329
he did say that no one's gonna find us
unless we get that transceiver working.

6
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:35,632
So... is there anything?

7
00:00:35,702 --> 00:00:38,398
- No.
- Okay.

8
00:00:39,672 --> 00:00:42,607
What were you doing
in the bathroom?

9
00:00:43,309 --> 00:00:46,506
Thought you could tell.
l was getting sick.

10
00:00:46,579 --> 00:00:51,516
Puking. My one tangible
contribution to the trek.

11
00:00:51,584 --> 00:00:55,850
No, l'm glad you came, Charlie.

12
00:00:55,922 --> 00:01:00,018
- Every trek needs a coward.
- You're not a coward.

13
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:09,826
[tapping]

14
00:01:16,743 --> 00:01:20,736
- Are you all right, sir?
- l'm good, thanks.

15
00:01:20,814 --> 00:01:24,545
- Can l get you a water or...?
- l'm fine. Thank you.

16
00:01:27,387 --> 00:01:29,378
Please?

17
00:01:31,624 --> 00:01:33,387
All right.

18
00:01:36,896 --> 00:01:40,093
[tapping continues]

19
00:01:59,152 --> 00:02:02,178
- Excuse me.
- [woman] Guess he really had to go.

20
00:02:02,255 --> 00:02:04,246
[flight attendant] Sir? Excuse me!

21
00:02:05,358 --> 00:02:07,349
Sir, excuse me.

22
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:19,367
[woman] Excuse me.

23
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:22,699
[rumbling]

24
00:02:24,477 --> 00:02:25,808
[bell rings]

25
00:02:31,084 --> 00:02:35,043
Ladies and gentleman, the captain has
turned on the ''fasten seatbelts'' sign.

26
00:02:35,121 --> 00:02:38,352
Please return to your seats
and fasten your seatbelts.

27
00:02:52,438 --> 00:02:54,429
[man knocking] Sir?
Are you all right?

28
00:02:55,608 --> 00:02:57,303
Just a minute.

29
00:03:02,248 --> 00:03:04,148
[knocking]

30
00:03:04,217 --> 00:03:05,775
Just a minute.

31
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:08,184
l'm gonna have to ask
that you open the door.

32
00:03:17,931 --> 00:03:19,057
[knocking]

33
00:03:19,132 --> 00:03:21,623
[man] Open the door now, sir.

34
00:03:23,169 --> 00:03:25,160
Sir?

35
00:03:32,979 --> 00:03:36,506
- [crashing]
- [grunting]

36
00:03:36,583 --> 00:03:39,416
[people yelling]

37
00:03:45,158 --> 00:03:49,527
[grunting, gasping]

38
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:07,080
[people chattering]

39
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,548
[people chattering]

40
00:04:17,857 --> 00:04:20,587
Hey. We're going through
some clothes. Sorting them.

41
00:04:21,661 --> 00:04:24,129
l see you found your bag.

42
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:28,397
- Come on, you wanna give us a hand?
- Not really.

43
00:04:29,002 --> 00:04:32,494
You're wasting your time.
They're coming.

44
00:04:34,707 --> 00:04:37,335
[Claire] ls that your boyfriend?

45
00:04:42,181 --> 00:04:45,378
My brother. Boone.

46
00:04:45,451 --> 00:04:48,716
God's friggin' gift to humanity.

47
00:04:52,558 --> 00:04:54,082
[sighs]

48
00:04:56,529 --> 00:04:58,497
l used to have a stomach.

49
00:05:05,738 --> 00:05:09,196
- Do you know what it is?
- Not yet.

50
00:05:14,247 --> 00:05:17,774
l haven't felt the baby move
since yesterday.

51
00:05:45,611 --> 00:05:47,602
[Michael] Excuse me.

52
00:05:51,984 --> 00:05:55,750
Hey, uh, have you, uh...?
Have you seen my boy?

53
00:05:59,292 --> 00:06:00,884
[speaking Korean]

54
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:10,366
[speaking Korean]

55
00:06:21,581 --> 00:06:23,173
Sorry.

56
00:06:25,251 --> 00:06:29,119
[Michael] Walt! Walt!

57
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:39,054
Vincent!

58
00:06:42,335 --> 00:06:44,462
Vincent!

59
00:06:57,717 --> 00:06:59,708
Come here, boy.

60
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:28,444
[Michael] Hey!

61
00:07:29,882 --> 00:07:32,146
What did l tell you
after what's happened?

62
00:07:32,218 --> 00:07:35,244
- l thought Vincent would be around.
- Stay on the beach.

63
00:07:35,321 --> 00:07:37,289
l thought this would be okay.

64
00:07:37,356 --> 00:07:41,224
Don't do that. You listen to me,
l mean what l say. You understand?

65
00:07:43,496 --> 00:07:45,487
- What is this?
- l just found 'em.

66
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:59,301
Come here.

67
00:08:04,684 --> 00:08:06,413
- Hey, guys, come on.
- [grunting]

68
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:07,817
Hey.

69
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:16,654
Hey! Break it up!

70
00:08:16,729 --> 00:08:19,254
- Break it up! Get off!
- Hey, come on, break it...

71
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:21,823
- You son of a bitch.
- That's it. lt's over.

72
00:08:21,901 --> 00:08:23,892
- Come on.
- That's it!

73
00:08:24,437 --> 00:08:26,837
- l'm sick of this redneck!
- Want some more?

74
00:08:26,906 --> 00:08:30,603
Tell everyone what you told me!
Tell them l made the plane crash.

75
00:08:30,676 --> 00:08:32,769
- The shoe fits!
- [Jack] What is going on?

76
00:08:32,845 --> 00:08:34,779
[speaking foreign language]

77
00:08:34,847 --> 00:08:38,010
- What's going on?
- My kid found these in the jungle.

78
00:08:38,384 --> 00:08:41,751
This guy was in the back row
of business class the whole flight.

79
00:08:41,821 --> 00:08:44,551
Never got up.
Hands folded underneath the blanket.

80
00:08:44,624 --> 00:08:48,060
And for some reason,
just pointing this out,

81
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:51,324
- the guy next to him didn't make it.
- Thank you for observing.

82
00:08:51,397 --> 00:08:54,525
Don't think l saw them pull you
out of line before we boarded?

83
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:57,091
- Come on! Bring it!
- Stop!

84
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:04,772
We found the transceiver,
but it's not working.

85
00:09:05,411 --> 00:09:07,572
Can anybody help?

86
00:09:10,983 --> 00:09:13,884
Yes, l might be able to.

87
00:09:13,953 --> 00:09:16,751
Oh, great! Perfect.
Let's trust this guy.

88
00:09:16,822 --> 00:09:18,653
Hey, we're all in this together.

89
00:09:18,724 --> 00:09:21,522
- Treat each other with respect...
- Shut up, lardo.

90
00:09:21,594 --> 00:09:23,357
Hey!

91
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:25,857
Give it a break.

92
00:09:27,833 --> 00:09:31,360
Whatever you say, doc,
you're the hero.

93
00:09:36,342 --> 00:09:38,367
You guys found the cockpit?

94
00:09:42,214 --> 00:09:43,545
Any survivors?

95
00:09:47,386 --> 00:09:49,286
No.

96
00:09:49,355 --> 00:09:51,186
[Sayid] Dual-band. Military spec.

97
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:55,159
Chances are the battery is good,
but the radio is dead.

98
00:09:55,227 --> 00:09:58,594
- Can you fix it?
- l need some time.

99
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:04,930
Doctor, that man with the shrapnel,
l think you should take a look at him.

100
00:10:15,214 --> 00:10:17,182
Chain-smoking jackass.

101
00:10:18,684 --> 00:10:24,486
- Some people have problems.
- Some people have problems. Us. Him.

102
00:10:28,227 --> 00:10:30,957
You're okay. l like you.

103
00:10:33,332 --> 00:10:35,994
You're okay too.

104
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:40,261
Hurley. Oh, just...

105
00:10:43,342 --> 00:10:44,866
Sayid.

106
00:10:49,715 --> 00:10:53,617
- How do you know how to do that?
- l was a communications officer.

107
00:10:53,686 --> 00:10:57,520
- Oh, yeah? You ever see battle?
- l fought in the Gulf War.

108
00:10:57,590 --> 00:11:00,559
No way. l got a buddy
who fought over there.

109
00:11:00,626 --> 00:11:05,620
He was in the 1 04th Airborne.
What were you, Air Force? Army?

110
00:11:05,698 --> 00:11:07,689
The Republican Guard.

111
00:11:56,615 --> 00:11:58,947
[woman speaking Korean]

112
00:12:28,447 --> 00:12:29,539
ls it working?

113
00:12:29,615 --> 00:12:32,448
lt seems to be, except
we're not picking up a signal.

114
00:12:32,518 --> 00:12:34,247
Why? Aren't we
trying to send one?

115
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,914
Yes, but what you want
to see here is little bars.

116
00:12:36,989 --> 00:12:39,082
The bars show
it's getting reception.

117
00:12:39,158 --> 00:12:42,127
- We need the bars?
- We could broadcast blind,

118
00:12:42,194 --> 00:12:45,925
hope that someone, maybe a ship
somewhere picks up our distress call.

119
00:12:45,998 --> 00:12:49,991
But that would be a waste of the
battery, which might not last for long.

120
00:12:51,237 --> 00:12:54,035
- There is one thing we could try.
- What?

121
00:12:54,106 --> 00:12:56,904
- Get the signal from high ground.
- How high?

122
00:13:33,612 --> 00:13:35,603
How is he?

123
00:13:36,215 --> 00:13:38,376
Can you do anything?

124
00:13:39,118 --> 00:13:42,986
- l can pull out the shrapnel.
- But you said if you took it out...

125
00:13:43,055 --> 00:13:47,389
That was yesterday. l was hoping
he'd be at a hospital by now.

126
00:13:47,459 --> 00:13:50,553
lf l leave him like this
he'll be dead within a day.

127
00:13:50,629 --> 00:13:52,529
lf l open him up...

128
00:13:52,598 --> 00:13:56,159
lf l can control the bleeding,
and if he doesn't go into sepsis,

129
00:13:56,235 --> 00:14:00,569
and if l can find some antibiotics,
he might be all right.

130
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:08,510
l'm going on a hike.

131
00:14:11,116 --> 00:14:13,414
- Sorry?
- Sayid fixed the transceiver,

132
00:14:13,485 --> 00:14:15,749
- but we can't use it, not from here.
- Wait.

133
00:14:15,821 --> 00:14:17,550
You said we had to send a signal.

134
00:14:17,623 --> 00:14:21,115
- You saw what that thing did.
- Yeah, l did.

135
00:14:22,261 --> 00:14:25,822
What makes you think we're any safer
here than we are in the jungle?

136
00:14:27,933 --> 00:14:31,699
- Wait for me. l don't know how long...
- Sayid said the battery won't last.

137
00:14:36,809 --> 00:14:38,333
All right.

138
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:42,506
lf you see or hear anything...
Anything...

139
00:14:46,452 --> 00:14:48,283
Run.

140
00:15:36,035 --> 00:15:38,435
[speaking Korean]

141
00:15:42,074 --> 00:15:45,134
- What's up?
- [speaking Korean]

142
00:15:48,881 --> 00:15:52,317
- What, that?
- [speaking Korean]

143
00:15:55,654 --> 00:15:58,384
What, eat that?

144
00:15:58,457 --> 00:16:01,392
[speaking Korean]

145
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:05,123
Dude, dude, l'm starving.

146
00:16:05,931 --> 00:16:08,923
But l am nowhere near that hungry.

147
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:13,397
No. No. No, thank you.

148
00:16:14,006 --> 00:16:17,032
No way. No.

149
00:16:17,109 --> 00:16:19,942
[chuckling]

150
00:16:33,859 --> 00:16:35,986
[Michael] The comic's in Spanish. You...

151
00:16:36,395 --> 00:16:40,695
- ...read Spanish?
- No. l found it.

152
00:16:52,044 --> 00:16:55,036
Tell you what, we get home...

153
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:58,282
...l'll get you another dog.

154
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:21,438
[Jack] Hey!

155
00:17:21,507 --> 00:17:23,737
- l need your help.
- Okay.

156
00:17:23,809 --> 00:17:27,973
Help me go through the luggage. l need
any prescription medications you find,

157
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:32,416
especially drugs that end in ''mycin''
and ''cillin.'' Those are antibiotics.

158
00:17:33,252 --> 00:17:35,152
What's this for?

159
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:37,745
[sniffing]

160
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:03,074
What are you doing?

161
00:18:07,052 --> 00:18:09,452
l think l was mean to him.

162
00:18:09,521 --> 00:18:11,216
What?

163
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:14,316
[sobbing] He's that guy from the gate.

164
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:20,263
He wouldn't let us have our seats
in first class. He saved our lives.

165
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:30,765
Shannon, we're trying to clear
the wreckage. You should help out.

166
00:18:30,843 --> 00:18:33,209
You're just being worthless over here.

167
00:18:33,278 --> 00:18:35,405
- Being what?
- What do you want me to say?

168
00:18:35,481 --> 00:18:39,611
- You're sitting staring at bodies.
- l've just been through a trauma.

169
00:18:39,685 --> 00:18:43,416
We all have. The difference
is you've given yourself a pedicure.

170
00:18:43,489 --> 00:18:44,478
You know what?

171
00:18:44,556 --> 00:18:47,787
- lt is easy to make fun of me...
- l wish l didn't waste my time.

172
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:49,987
l wish l didn't have a reason!
lt is easy.

173
00:18:50,062 --> 00:18:54,590
Screw you. You do not have
the slightest idea what l am thinking.

174
00:18:54,666 --> 00:18:58,693
- No, you don't!
- Okay, Shannon, what are you thinking?

175
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:11,506
l'm going with them.
On the hike.

176
00:19:11,583 --> 00:19:13,642
- Oh, yeah?
- Yup. l'm going.

177
00:19:13,719 --> 00:19:18,520
- No you're not, Shannon. Shannon!
- l'd like to come with you.

178
00:19:19,057 --> 00:19:20,991
- She's not going.
- The hell l'm not!

179
00:19:21,059 --> 00:19:23,118
- This is what she does.
- You don't know!

180
00:19:23,195 --> 00:19:25,595
Makes bad decisions
to upset her family, me.

181
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:30,124
Shut up and stop trying to be charming.
l'm coming with you.

182
00:19:30,202 --> 00:19:35,139
- l don't know if that's a good idea.
- What are you, two years older than me?

183
00:19:35,207 --> 00:19:38,233
- You're going, aren't you?
- Yeah. Are you?

184
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:41,006
- Yup.
- Yeah, l'm definitely going.

185
00:19:41,079 --> 00:19:44,412
Look, everybody can come.
But we're leaving now.

186
00:19:44,783 --> 00:19:47,718
You couldn't tell from that,
but she's really nice.

187
00:20:30,963 --> 00:20:33,761
[Kate] You decided to join us.

188
00:20:33,832 --> 00:20:36,995
l'm a complex guy, sweetheart.

189
00:21:42,434 --> 00:21:44,402
[Michael] What are you looking for?

190
00:21:45,337 --> 00:21:47,669
Some sort of blade.

191
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:50,599
How's your son?

192
00:21:50,676 --> 00:21:52,610
Walt?

193
00:21:52,678 --> 00:21:55,044
Yeah, l think he'll be all right.

194
00:21:55,981 --> 00:22:00,418
- How old is he?
- Nine. Ten.

195
00:22:00,485 --> 00:22:02,612
Ten.

196
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:08,191
Walt's more worried
about his dog than anything.

197
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:10,524
The dog was on the plane, so...

198
00:22:10,862 --> 00:22:13,831
- Kids, you know.
- ls it a lab?

199
00:22:15,701 --> 00:22:17,430
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

200
00:22:17,502 --> 00:22:21,438
- l saw him yesterday. ln the jungle.
- What? Where?

201
00:22:21,506 --> 00:22:23,667
Over there...

202
00:22:23,742 --> 00:22:26,973
...a couple hundred yards in or so.
He looked good.

203
00:22:49,601 --> 00:22:52,297
What is it, like checkers?

204
00:22:53,438 --> 00:22:56,839
Not really.
lt's a better game than checkers.

205
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:10,444
Do you play checkers with your pop?

206
00:23:10,522 --> 00:23:12,080
No.

207
00:23:12,157 --> 00:23:15,524
l live in Australia with my mom.

208
00:23:15,594 --> 00:23:17,755
You have no accent.

209
00:23:17,829 --> 00:23:20,127
Yeah, l know, we move a lot.

210
00:23:21,466 --> 00:23:24,458
She got sick.
She died a couple of weeks ago.

211
00:23:27,672 --> 00:23:30,800
- You're having a bad month.
- l guess.

212
00:23:41,987 --> 00:23:44,922
Backgammon is the
oldest game in the world.

213
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:48,523
Archaeologists found sets
when they excavated the ruins

214
00:23:48,593 --> 00:23:53,360
of ancient Mesopotamia.
Five thousand years old.

215
00:23:53,899 --> 00:23:56,299
That's older than Jesus Christ.

216
00:23:57,436 --> 00:23:59,461
Did they have dice and stuff?

217
00:24:00,772 --> 00:24:04,435
But theirs weren't made of plastic.
Their dice were made of bones.

218
00:24:04,509 --> 00:24:06,306
Cool.

219
00:24:07,512 --> 00:24:09,912
Two players. Two sides.

220
00:24:11,149 --> 00:24:14,846
One is light. One is dark.

221
00:24:21,827 --> 00:24:23,954
Walt...

222
00:24:27,098 --> 00:24:29,430
...do you wanna know a secret?

223
00:24:35,173 --> 00:24:37,698
[speaking Korean]

224
00:24:39,478 --> 00:24:42,140
No, thank you.
No, that's fine. [giggles]

225
00:24:42,214 --> 00:24:44,648
[speaking Korean]

226
00:24:44,716 --> 00:24:45,978
No.

227
00:24:51,523 --> 00:24:54,219
Okay. Thanks.

228
00:24:58,029 --> 00:24:59,997
[speaking Korean]

229
00:25:07,105 --> 00:25:10,438
- Mmm.
- [speaking Korean]

230
00:25:12,711 --> 00:25:15,202
[gasping]

231
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:16,975
Oh, God.

232
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:20,241
l just felt it!

233
00:25:20,318 --> 00:25:22,718
l just... Come here, feel this!

234
00:25:23,955 --> 00:25:25,980
Feel this. Please.

235
00:25:27,893 --> 00:25:30,691
Do you feel that?
That, right there.

236
00:25:30,762 --> 00:25:32,320
That's a kick!

237
00:25:34,232 --> 00:25:36,291
There, right there's a foot!

238
00:25:36,368 --> 00:25:38,836
Oh, my God, wait,
he's moving around.

239
00:25:40,171 --> 00:25:42,162
He. He.

240
00:25:43,141 --> 00:25:45,541
l guess l think you're a he.

241
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:59,918
[Sawyer] Okay. Wide open space.
Check the radio, see if we're good.

242
00:25:59,991 --> 00:26:02,721
- We're not gonna have reception.
- Just try it.

243
00:26:02,794 --> 00:26:06,321
- l don't want to waste batteries.
- l'm not asking to keep it on.

244
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:09,424
- We're blocked by the mountain.
- Check the damn radio!

245
00:26:09,501 --> 00:26:12,061
We might not have any juice left
when we get to...

246
00:26:12,137 --> 00:26:13,468
[grunt]

247
00:26:17,309 --> 00:26:20,437
[rustling]

248
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:23,611
Oh, my God.

249
00:26:23,949 --> 00:26:27,612
- What the hell's that?
- Something's coming.

250
00:26:27,686 --> 00:26:30,382
[snarling]

251
00:26:30,455 --> 00:26:31,615
Coming towards us.

252
00:26:31,690 --> 00:26:32,679
[snarling]

253
00:26:32,757 --> 00:26:37,126
- Come on, let's move.
- l shouldn't have come on this hike!

254
00:26:37,195 --> 00:26:39,595
[Shannon screaming]

255
00:26:39,664 --> 00:26:41,564
- Go, go!
- Sawyer!

256
00:26:41,633 --> 00:26:45,296
- Let him go!
- [Shannon continues screaming]

257
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:50,007
[gunshots]

258
00:26:56,514 --> 00:26:57,913
[roaring]

259
00:26:58,750 --> 00:27:01,412
[groaning]

260
00:27:11,096 --> 00:27:13,121
[Shannon] That's...

261
00:27:14,099 --> 00:27:16,260
That's a big bear.

262
00:27:16,568 --> 00:27:19,503
You think that's what killed the pilot?

263
00:27:19,571 --> 00:27:24,838
No. No, that's a tiny,
teeny version compared to that.

264
00:27:24,909 --> 00:27:29,744
- [breathing heavily]
- Guys, this isn't just a bear.

265
00:27:33,018 --> 00:27:35,077
lt's a polar bear.

266
00:27:40,425 --> 00:27:42,450
You sure he's out?

267
00:27:43,028 --> 00:27:45,155
He's out. [sighs]

268
00:27:45,997 --> 00:27:49,228
How do you know he won't wake up
when you yank that thing out?

269
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:51,063
l don't.

270
00:27:55,173 --> 00:27:57,641
Hey, guy, you awake?

271
00:27:58,176 --> 00:28:02,112
Yo! There's a rescue plane!
We're saved! Yay!

272
00:28:03,081 --> 00:28:05,072
Yeah, he's out.

273
00:28:07,585 --> 00:28:09,815
So, what do you want me...?

274
00:28:09,888 --> 00:28:12,186
lt's unlikely
he'll regain consciousness,

275
00:28:12,257 --> 00:28:15,385
but the pain might bring him around.
lf it does, hold him down.

276
00:28:20,298 --> 00:28:24,564
Uh... l'm not so good
around blood, man.

277
00:28:25,303 --> 00:28:26,827
Then don't look.

278
00:28:26,905 --> 00:28:29,430
Yeah. But...

279
00:28:29,507 --> 00:28:31,873
l'm not so good around blood.

280
00:28:31,943 --> 00:28:34,241
Just do the best you can, okay?

281
00:28:41,386 --> 00:28:44,014
- Don't look.
- [breathing nervously] Okay.

282
00:28:44,089 --> 00:28:46,751
[mumbling]

283
00:28:52,530 --> 00:28:54,020
- [grunts]
- [groans]

284
00:28:56,101 --> 00:28:59,195
[both straining]

285
00:28:59,270 --> 00:29:00,430
Dude.

286
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,540
- Hand me those strips.
- Dude.

287
00:29:04,609 --> 00:29:08,067
- l need to get this bleeding stopped.
- l don't think l can.

288
00:29:08,146 --> 00:29:10,842
- What? What's going on?
- Just hand me the strips.

289
00:29:10,915 --> 00:29:13,110
Give it to me.
Don't even think about it.

290
00:29:13,184 --> 00:29:15,744
Don't even think it. Hurley, hey!

291
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:17,117
Damn it.

292
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:21,715
- That can't be a polar bear.
- lt's a polar bear.

293
00:29:21,793 --> 00:29:23,090
[Shannon] Wait a minute.

294
00:29:23,161 --> 00:29:26,597
- Polar bears don't live in the jungle.
- Spot-on.

295
00:29:26,664 --> 00:29:29,724
- Polar bears don't live this far south.
- This one does.

296
00:29:29,801 --> 00:29:32,167
Did. lt did.

297
00:29:33,204 --> 00:29:34,728
Where did that come from?

298
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:37,530
Probably Bear Village.
How the hell do l know?

299
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:40,203
Not the bear, the gun.

300
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:44,477
- l got it off one of the bodies.
- One of the bodies?

301
00:29:44,549 --> 00:29:47,609
- One of the bodies.
- People don't carry guns on planes.

302
00:29:47,685 --> 00:29:50,916
They do if they're a U.S. marshal.
There was one on the plane.

303
00:29:50,989 --> 00:29:52,547
How do you know that?

304
00:29:52,624 --> 00:29:55,923
l saw a guy lying there with
an ankle holster, so l took the gun,

305
00:29:55,994 --> 00:29:56,795
thought it might come in handy.
Guess what, l just shot a bear.

306
00:29:56,795 --> 00:30:00,424
thought it might come in handy.
Guess what, l just shot a bear.

307
00:30:00,999 --> 00:30:04,594
- So why do you think he's a marshal?
- Because he had a clip-on badge!

308
00:30:04,669 --> 00:30:08,105
- l took that too. Thought it was cool.
- [Sayid] l know who you are.

309
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:10,965
- You're the prisoner.
- l'm the what?

310
00:30:11,042 --> 00:30:12,976
You found a gun on a U.S. marshal?

311
00:30:13,044 --> 00:30:17,242
You knew where it was because he
was bringing you back to the States.

312
00:30:17,315 --> 00:30:19,749
The handcuffs were on you.
That's how you knew.

313
00:30:19,818 --> 00:30:21,513
- Piss off!
- That's who you are.

314
00:30:21,586 --> 00:30:23,816
Be as suspicious of me
as l am of you.

315
00:30:23,888 --> 00:30:26,322
- You are the prisoner.
- Fine, l'm the criminal.

316
00:30:26,391 --> 00:30:28,655
You're the terrorist.
We'll all play a part!

317
00:30:28,726 --> 00:30:30,853
Who do you wanna be?

318
00:30:34,432 --> 00:30:38,459
- Does anybody know how to use a gun?
- l think you just pull the trigger.

319
00:30:38,536 --> 00:30:41,733
- Don't use the gun.
- l want to take it apart.

320
00:30:43,408 --> 00:30:47,504
There's a button on the grip.
Push that, it will eject the magazine.

321
00:30:47,979 --> 00:30:50,812
There's still a round in the chamber.

322
00:30:50,882 --> 00:30:53,476
Hold the grip,
pull the top part of the gun.

323
00:31:07,799 --> 00:31:11,792
- l know your type.
- l'm not so sure.

324
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:15,362
Yeah, l've been with girls like you.

325
00:31:16,808 --> 00:31:19,208
Not girls exactly like me.

326
00:31:39,464 --> 00:31:41,489
[woman] Can l get you a refill?

327
00:31:42,533 --> 00:31:44,865
- l'm fine with this, thank you.
- [bell dings]

328
00:31:44,936 --> 00:31:49,066
You, sir, can l get you anything?
Cocktail, soda?

329
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:51,335
Just coffee, sweetheart. Black.

330
00:31:51,409 --> 00:31:53,775
Coffee, sure.

331
00:31:56,814 --> 00:31:58,304
You look worried.

332
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:01,650
l'd be worried too, l was you.

333
00:32:01,719 --> 00:32:04,017
But you gotta stay positive, kiddo.

334
00:32:04,088 --> 00:32:07,888
There's always that off-chance
that they'll believe your story.

335
00:32:07,959 --> 00:32:09,586
l know l sure do.

336
00:32:11,062 --> 00:32:14,589
- l don't care what you believe.
- Oh, l know that's true.

337
00:32:14,666 --> 00:32:17,362
That has always been true.

338
00:32:19,170 --> 00:32:22,469
You sure you don't
want some more juice?

339
00:32:26,778 --> 00:32:28,871
Yeah, l'm sure.

340
00:32:30,081 --> 00:32:32,242
[bell rings]

341
00:32:41,259 --> 00:32:43,750

343
00:32:49,334 --> 00:32:50,892

Maybe they came for them.
