00:00:02,335 --> 00:00:05,327
How do you open the hatch
that has no handle, no latch?

3
00:00:05,405 --> 00:00:07,600
People are talking
about what we're doing.

4
00:00:07,674 --> 00:00:09,369
- Tell them.
- They're not ready.

5
00:00:09,442 --> 00:00:11,967
- l saw a Beechcraft.
- What is inside of it?

6
00:00:12,045 --> 00:00:14,036
You're gonna have
to climb up there.

7
00:00:14,114 --> 00:00:15,604
Anybody out there?

8
00:00:15,682 --> 00:00:16,876
Mayday!

00:00:21,454 --> 00:00:22,614
Help!

10
00:00:23,356 --> 00:00:26,382
- What happened?
- An accident. Boone fell off a cliff.

11
00:00:26,459 --> 00:00:28,222
Tell me exactly what happened.

12
00:00:28,361 --> 00:00:30,989
John? Locke!

13
00:00:31,965 --> 00:00:32,399
Come on. Out of the way!

14
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:33,423
Come on. Out of the way!

- Can you hear me?

17
00:00:39,172 --> 00:00:40,605
What happened?

18
00:00:40,673 --> 00:00:42,470
- He was with Locke.
- Keep him steady.

19
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:44,567
- He's bleeding.
- l know he's bleeding.

20
00:00:44,644 --> 00:00:47,078
Keep him steady, damn it!
You gotta press harder.

21
00:00:47,147 --> 00:00:49,206
- l'm trying.
- All right. Slow and gentle.

22
00:00:50,316 --> 00:00:51,783
Easy!

23
00:00:54,154 --> 00:00:56,884
Sun, pair of scissors
in the second drawer of the cart.

24
00:00:57,791 --> 00:00:59,258
Second drawer.

25
00:01:01,961 --> 00:01:05,124
There are diapers in the drawer.
Sun's gonna switch with you.

26
00:01:05,198 --> 00:01:07,098
- Sun, l need...
- Yes, l understand.

27
00:01:07,167 --> 00:01:09,032
Grab me that seat
from up there.

28

l need that mesh.
We need to create some sterile...

29
00:01:11,771 --> 00:01:16,037
- l swear to God, if you faint...
- No. First class, mesh. l'm cool.

30
00:01:16,109 --> 00:01:17,667
- Lord.
- Get to the beach.

31

- Rubbing, scotch...
- [Boone gasping]

[Kate] Jack,
what's going on?

34
00:01:26,686 --> 00:01:28,745
His lung just collapsed.

35
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:31,652
OK.

36
00:01:50,443 --> 00:01:52,570
[Jack] OK. OK.

37
00:01:53,079 --> 00:01:54,444
Good, Boone.

38
00:01:55,048 --> 00:01:57,642
Good, Boone.
That's good. Good job.

39
00:01:58,318 --> 00:02:01,879
All right. l'm gonna put a tube in that,
and you're gonna be just fine.

40
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:05,080
What are you still doing here?

41
00:02:05,992 --> 00:02:09,723
Alcohol. You want him to live?
Get to the beach! Now!

42
00:02:11,464 --> 00:02:14,399
[Boone wheezing]

43
00:02:24,177 --> 00:02:25,974
Damn it.
Just get the clip-on.

44
00:02:26,045 --> 00:02:28,912
You know why they call it a tie?
'Cause you gotta tie it.

45
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:31,450
Know why they call it a clip-on?
You clip it on.

46
00:02:33,219 --> 00:02:36,154
- You nervous?
- What do l have to be nervous about?

47
00:02:36,222 --> 00:02:39,589
- lt's a big responsibility.
- l can handle responsibility.

48
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:41,684
You don't like to get up
in front of crowds.

49
00:02:41,761 --> 00:02:42,921
l'll be fine.

50
00:02:45,031 --> 00:02:46,726
After eight beers,
l'll be fine.

51
00:02:46,799 --> 00:02:49,097
- She'll bust you, man.
- l'll brush my teeth.

52
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:51,569
She'll bust you.

53
00:02:52,972 --> 00:02:55,497
You can still back out, Marc.

54
00:02:56,943 --> 00:03:00,902
No, it's just a stupid speech.

55
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:02,948
l'll make you proud.

56
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:05,541
OK, groom's turn.

57
00:03:07,687 --> 00:03:10,019
You can still back out, Jack.

58
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:16,495
[Boone] Oh, it hurts.

59
00:03:17,897 --> 00:03:21,298
lt's a closed fracture,
but l think l can set it.

60
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:23,631
- [Boone] l'm gonna die.
- His chest. The wound.

61
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:26,501
Can you sew him?

62
00:03:26,573 --> 00:03:30,373
He's lost a lot of blood. l don't know
how far Locke had to carry him.

63
00:03:31,811 --> 00:03:33,073
Listen. Listen!

64
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,948
You are not gonna die.
l'm gonna fix this, OK?

65
00:03:39,786 --> 00:03:42,482
l am going to save you.

66
00:04:06,846 --> 00:04:10,179
[Michael] You gotta flip them
or they'll burn, Walt.

67
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,115
[Sawyer]
Hey, <i>mamacita!</i>

68
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:14,447
Want some fish?

69
00:04:15,555 --> 00:04:18,023
No, thanks.
l'm not really hungry.

70
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:23,354
How long do you think?
Till it's ready?

71
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:26,057
Maybe a week. Maybe less.

72
00:04:28,801 --> 00:04:30,666
You OK?

73
00:04:30,737 --> 00:04:33,638
Yeah, l'm fine.
All right, l'll see you guys later.

74
00:04:35,174 --> 00:04:37,404
She likes me.

75
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:41,008
[Michael] Hey, Jin!

76
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:44,607
Want some fish?
Take a break. Eat some fish.

77
00:04:48,021 --> 00:04:50,819
[Sawyer] Man's got
an overzealous work ethic.

78
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:53,324
Try ''obsession''.

79
00:04:53,393 --> 00:04:55,293
He wants off this island bad, man.

80
00:04:55,361 --> 00:04:57,386
Can't say l blame poor Kato.

81
00:04:57,463 --> 00:05:00,557
His lady speaks English all this time,
and he didn't have a clue?

82
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:02,498
Surprised he didn't
swim outta here.

83
00:05:02,568 --> 00:05:05,594
- Hell, l would've.
- Sawyer, l need all your alcohol.

84
00:05:05,672 --> 00:05:07,196
Now!

85
00:05:10,476 --> 00:05:11,966
How'd it happen?

86
00:05:12,045 --> 00:05:15,742
Locke said that he fell off a cliff
while they were out hunting boar.

87
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:17,680
The boar they never seem to get?

88
00:05:19,185 --> 00:05:22,848
- ls that it?
- Afraid so. You need anything else?

89
00:05:22,922 --> 00:05:25,914
- l can come with you.
- Too many cooks already.

90
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:27,687
But thanks.

91
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:33,264
[Boone] l'm sorry.
l'm really sorry.

92
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:36,325
[wheezing]

93
00:05:36,402 --> 00:05:38,529
l'm sorry.

94
00:05:45,712 --> 00:05:49,478
[wheezing]

95
00:05:50,683 --> 00:05:53,049
- He needs blood.
- [Sun] What?

96
00:05:53,119 --> 00:05:56,111
Blood. A transfusion.

97
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:58,282
- How will you do...
- l don't know.

98
00:05:58,358 --> 00:05:59,950
We'll figure it out.

99
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:05,491
After l set the leg.

100
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:11,731
- Let me.
- No, that's OK.

101
00:06:11,804 --> 00:06:13,294
Let me.

102
00:06:14,907 --> 00:06:16,875
Get some air.

103
00:06:24,016 --> 00:06:25,540
How is he?

104
00:06:25,618 --> 00:06:27,711
- Don't know yet.
- What happened out there?

105
00:06:27,787 --> 00:06:29,721
- Where's Locke?
- l don't know.

106
00:06:29,789 --> 00:06:31,780
- What? He just took off?
- Yeah.

107
00:06:31,858 --> 00:06:34,258
- Charlie, he just took off.
- Where's Shannon?

108
00:06:34,327 --> 00:06:36,158
- l don't know.
- She's his sister.

109
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:39,062
l don't know where she is!

110
00:06:42,301 --> 00:06:44,326
[Marc] And here she is,

111
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:47,237
the future Mrs. Jack Shephard.

112
00:06:47,306 --> 00:06:48,864
Thank you, Marc.

113
00:06:48,941 --> 00:06:51,739
Wow! Can l get
another microphone?

114
00:06:51,811 --> 00:06:53,574
l think this one's been drinking.

115
00:06:53,646 --> 00:06:55,671
[laughter]

116
00:06:57,383 --> 00:06:59,544
A little over two years ago,

117
00:06:59,619 --> 00:07:01,519
l blew a tire out,

118
00:07:01,587 --> 00:07:04,852
flipped over the center divider
into oncoming traffic

119
00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:07,722
and was hit head-on
by an SUV.

120
00:07:08,661 --> 00:07:10,720
My back was broken.

121
00:07:10,797 --> 00:07:14,392
They all said it was irreparable.

122
00:07:17,303 --> 00:07:19,703
And then there was Jack.

123
00:07:21,808 --> 00:07:24,641
And he promised
that he would fix me.

124
00:07:26,045 --> 00:07:29,845
Because that's
the kind of guy he is.

125
00:07:32,585 --> 00:07:36,385
Because you are the most
committed man l have ever known.

126
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:42,022
Because you fixed me,

127
00:07:43,996 --> 00:07:47,523
l will dance at our wedding.

128
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:54,101
- To Jack.
- [glasses clinking]

129
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:58,139
My hero. Jack.

130
00:07:58,211 --> 00:08:00,611
[applause]

131
00:08:10,756 --> 00:08:13,452
Give him this for the pain.

132
00:08:15,428 --> 00:08:18,556
l think we're a little beyond
herbal remedies here.

133
00:08:18,631 --> 00:08:20,531
lt is not a remedy.

134
00:08:31,911 --> 00:08:33,401
Will you hold his shoulders?

135
00:08:45,124 --> 00:08:46,785
Here we go.

136
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:49,851
[Boone screams]

137
00:08:57,770 --> 00:09:00,170
Ah!

138
00:09:00,239 --> 00:09:02,298
[groaning]

139
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:07,610
Come on.

140
00:09:12,952 --> 00:09:15,216
[groaning]

141
00:09:28,634 --> 00:09:31,660
[groaning, panting]

142
00:09:33,606 --> 00:09:35,574
[panting]

143
00:09:35,641 --> 00:09:38,542
Claire? What are you
doing out here?

144
00:09:38,611 --> 00:09:41,307
Nothing.
Just leave me alone, please.

145
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:45,551
[groaning]

146
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:48,481
Oh, God.

147
00:09:49,655 --> 00:09:51,782
You're having the baby.

148
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:58,419
Um, Claire, we need
to get you back to camp.

149
00:09:58,497 --> 00:10:00,658
l'm fine. l just need
to catch my breath.

150
00:10:00,733 --> 00:10:02,758
lt's not OK.
You're having your baby.

151
00:10:02,835 --> 00:10:04,894
No, l'm not.
lt's just gas pains.

152
00:10:04,971 --> 00:10:07,201
- You're having contractions.
- No, l'm not!

153
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:09,605
- Just leave me alone.
- l gotta get you to Jack.

154
00:10:09,675 --> 00:10:12,337
- Please, try to stand.
- Look, l can't!

155
00:10:18,317 --> 00:10:19,477

164
00:11:06,432 --> 00:11:08,297
[speaking Korean]

165
00:11:08,367 --> 00:11:09,698
Hey, Jin!

166
00:11:09,769 --> 00:11:12,499
l need you to go to the caves
and get Jack. OK?

167
00:11:12,571 --> 00:11:13,629
Understand?

168
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:17,635
- We need Jack.
- Jack. Doctor.

169
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:21,771
- Yes, doctor. Please come here.
- Oh, this one's big.

170
00:11:21,847 --> 00:11:25,078
- Don't leave me.
- Oh, no, honey, l won't.

171
00:11:25,151 --> 00:11:27,642
l'm not going anywhere, OK?
l promise.

172
00:11:28,721 --> 00:11:31,747
Jack. Hurry.

173
00:11:33,225 --> 00:11:35,056
- Ask him again.
- He's in shock.

174
00:11:35,127 --> 00:11:37,254
That's why you need
to ask him again.

175
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,166
Boone, can you hear me?

176
00:11:43,235 --> 00:11:45,635
What is your blood type?

177
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:52,504
Boone, please listen.
What is your blood type?

178
00:11:52,578 --> 00:11:53,909
Damn it.

179
00:11:53,979 --> 00:11:58,416
- Maybe a smaller piece.
- Veins are like a wet noodle.

180
00:11:58,484 --> 00:12:01,647
First you have to find one,
then you have to have a hollow needle

181
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:05,020
sharp enough to actually pierce it.
l've got bamboo.

182
00:12:08,527 --> 00:12:11,394
None of that matters because
l don't know his blood type.

183
00:12:11,464 --> 00:12:14,399
- Not to mention his injuries...
- [Boone] A-negative.

184
00:12:17,269 --> 00:12:20,534
- Boone, what'd you say?
- Oh, Shannon, the plane.

185
00:12:20,606 --> 00:12:22,597
Did you hear ''A-negative''?

186
00:12:23,309 --> 00:12:26,745
Get Charlie. Ask everyone you can find
what their blood type is.

187
00:12:26,812 --> 00:12:29,110
A-negative, OK?

188
00:12:29,181 --> 00:12:30,944
And find his sister.

189
00:12:31,016 --> 00:12:32,506
Find Shannon.

190
00:12:33,319 --> 00:12:34,445
Where are we going?

191
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:39,622
- This way.
- Oh, OK.

192
00:12:43,162 --> 00:12:44,993
Are you lost?

193
00:12:45,064 --> 00:12:47,498
No. Absolutely not.

194
00:12:48,534 --> 00:12:51,025
Those trees look really familiar.

195
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:54,569
lt's this way, l think.

196
00:12:55,875 --> 00:12:57,809
Did you say ''l think''?

197
00:13:07,186 --> 00:13:09,518
[Sayid] Surprise.

198
00:13:13,225 --> 00:13:14,817
Damn it.

199
00:13:14,894 --> 00:13:16,452
l found an ''A''.

200
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:19,222
- Positive or negative?
- She doesn't know.

201
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:22,995
l also found two B-positives
and one A/B-negative.

202
00:13:23,068 --> 00:13:25,002
At least he thinks so.

203
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:28,130
- Did you find any O-Negatives?
- Sun said A-Negative.

204
00:13:28,207 --> 00:13:31,199
- Where is she?
- We split up. l thought she'd be here.

205
00:13:31,277 --> 00:13:34,678
- And you only asked four people?
- l asked the whole sodding camp.

206
00:13:34,747 --> 00:13:37,807
No one knows their blood type.
l don't know my blood type.

207
00:13:37,883 --> 00:13:40,511
- Did you find Shannon?
- No.

208
00:13:40,586 --> 00:13:42,178
l was getting you this.

209
00:13:48,294 --> 00:13:49,693
A hollow needle.

210
00:13:49,762 --> 00:13:52,731
Sharp enough to pierce a noodle.

211
00:13:58,971 --> 00:14:00,529
lt's perfect.

212
00:14:00,606 --> 00:14:04,440
Not to rain on your parade, but l
thought you said we needed A-negative.

213
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:07,206
- Or O-negative.
- Right. Which no one is.

214
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:09,679
Someone is.

215
00:14:09,748 --> 00:14:13,184
- You! Why'd you make me...
- O-neg is ''universal donor''.

216
00:14:13,252 --> 00:14:16,244
lt's in the ballpark.
lt's not a match.

217
00:14:16,322 --> 00:14:19,086
My blood could put him
into anaphylactic shock.

218
00:14:19,592 --> 00:14:21,492
Stop his heart.

219
00:14:22,628 --> 00:14:24,960
You mean he'll die?

220
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:26,588
He's not gonna die.

221
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:47,278
Those girls are checking you out.

222
00:14:49,154 --> 00:14:51,748
You're in your pj's.

223
00:14:51,824 --> 00:14:53,621
lndeed l am.

224
00:14:55,694 --> 00:14:57,662
- Are they cute?
- Who?

225
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:59,789
The girls who are checking me out.

226
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:04,200
Mm... One of them's kinda cute.

227
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:05,703
The other one's just trashy.

228
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:10,473
- <i>Heart and Soul?</i>
- You got it.

229
00:15:10,542 --> 00:15:13,511
- l'm taking the easy part.
- Of course.

230
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:24,383
You know you don't have to do this
if you don't want to.

231
00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:27,820
How do you know l haven't?

232
00:15:27,893 --> 00:15:30,885
Because you haven't.

233
00:15:30,963 --> 00:15:32,794
- [plays off-key note]
- Sorry.

234
00:15:34,366 --> 00:15:37,392
lt was a silly idea.
l read too many bridal magazines.

235
00:15:37,469 --> 00:15:41,337
- l think it rotted my brain.
- Sarah, l want to. l'm going to.

236
00:15:41,407 --> 00:15:45,434
l just have to figure out
the right way to say it.

237
00:15:47,079 --> 00:15:49,047
Just vows.

238
00:15:49,515 --> 00:15:51,005
Just vows.

239
00:15:56,021 --> 00:15:57,010
Hey...

240
00:16:00,726 --> 00:16:03,251
- He's gonna come.
- Yeah. l...

241
00:16:03,329 --> 00:16:04,591
l know.

242
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:10,795
So you stay down here
as long as you need to.

243
00:16:11,904 --> 00:16:15,135
And when you're ready,
l'll be upstairs.

244
00:16:21,347 --> 00:16:25,613
l cannot wait to marry you,
Jack Shephard.

245
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:39,263
[Jin] Jack! Jack!

246
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:42,892
- Jack. Doctor. Jack.
- Jack.

247
00:17:00,219 --> 00:17:03,211
[speaking Korean]

248
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:08,523
- Claire!
- Claire? What about Claire?

249
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:13,191
He says Claire's with Kate.
She's in labor.

250
00:17:13,265 --> 00:17:15,358
Claire's having the baby?
Where?

251
00:17:19,271 --> 00:17:22,001
He says he thinks she's OK,
but she's in pain.

252
00:17:22,074 --> 00:17:24,599
Does he know how fast
the contractions are coming?

253
00:17:27,646 --> 00:17:29,580
- Every two minutes.
- ls she nauseous?

254
00:17:29,948 --> 00:17:32,883
Can she stand? ls there any bleeding?
Did her water break?

255
00:17:35,154 --> 00:17:36,815
No, none of that.

256
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:39,517
- But she can't move.
- We should go. What do we need?

257
00:17:39,591 --> 00:17:42,151
Towels? Bandages? Hot water?

258
00:17:42,227 --> 00:17:44,525
- How do we take water?
- You'll figure that out.

259
00:17:44,596 --> 00:17:46,860
Tell Jin to take Charlie
and go back to Claire.

260
00:17:46,932 --> 00:17:50,231
l can do that. That dilating thing,
how do you look for that?

261
00:17:50,302 --> 00:17:53,032
Listen to me. Tell Kate...
Charlie, look at me.

262
00:17:53,105 --> 00:17:56,074
Tell Kate to wait
until the contractions

263
00:17:56,141 --> 00:17:57,665
are 60 seconds apart.

264
00:17:57,743 --> 00:17:58,732
You got that?

265
00:17:58,811 --> 00:18:01,177
She's gonna need
to make sure Claire pushes,

266
00:18:01,246 --> 00:18:02,736
but not too hard, not too fast,

267
00:18:02,815 --> 00:18:04,715
just until the head is clear,

268
00:18:04,783 --> 00:18:07,081
and then as hard as she can.

269
00:18:07,152 --> 00:18:10,952
When the baby is out, make sure
she clears its nose and its mouth.

270
00:18:11,023 --> 00:18:13,856
- But you'll be there by then, right?
- No, l won't.

271
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:15,951
l'm not going anywhere.

272
00:18:16,895 --> 00:18:19,090
l need to stay here.

273
00:18:19,331 --> 00:18:20,491
And you tell Kate...

274
00:18:21,533 --> 00:18:24,593
...she's gonna have to
deliver this baby.

275
00:18:37,082 --> 00:18:38,811
They've stopped.

276
00:18:40,486 --> 00:18:43,751
- That happens, l think.
- No. They're not coming anymore.

277
00:18:43,822 --> 00:18:46,791
- l'm fine. l'm OK.
- Claire...

278
00:18:46,859 --> 00:18:50,351
- No. l'm OK. Really.
- l don't think that you should be...

279
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:54,956
- What is that?
- l think your water just broke.

280
00:18:55,601 --> 00:18:58,468
No, no.
l can't have the baby now.

281
00:18:58,537 --> 00:19:01,836
- Just hold on.
- l can't have the baby now!

282
00:19:01,907 --> 00:19:03,272
Jack's coming.

283
00:19:03,342 --> 00:19:05,572
Claire, he's coming.

284
00:19:18,123 --> 00:19:20,785
[raspy breathing]

285
00:19:24,897 --> 00:19:28,458
l screwed myself up pretty bad, huh?

286
00:19:30,369 --> 00:19:31,859
[Jack] Hey.

287
00:19:33,705 --> 00:19:35,866
My leg hurts.

288
00:19:35,941 --> 00:19:37,875
Don't try to move it.

289
00:19:37,943 --> 00:19:41,777
- Can you breathe OK?
- lt fell on me.

290
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:45,180
- What fell?
- A plane. lt was a plane.

291
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:47,650
Boone? Boone.

292
00:19:47,719 --> 00:19:49,949
Locke said you fell from a cliff.

293
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:53,514
No, it was...

294
00:19:53,592 --> 00:19:56,823
lt fell... the plane.

295
00:19:57,763 --> 00:19:59,788
lt's because of the hatch.

296
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:02,265
- We found the hatch...
- Boone? Boone?

297
00:20:02,334 --> 00:20:04,859
Stay with me, man.
Stay with me.

298
00:20:07,272 --> 00:20:09,206
Locke said...

299
00:20:09,274 --> 00:20:10,935
John...

300
00:20:11,009 --> 00:20:14,069
John said... not to tell.

301
00:20:15,914 --> 00:20:20,351
- They built a hatch.
- What'd Locke do? What hatch?

302
00:20:20,419 --> 00:20:22,580
My leg hurts.

303
00:20:22,654 --> 00:20:25,487
Boone? Boone. Hey.

304
00:20:29,761 --> 00:20:33,458
Shannon... Shannon.

305
00:20:33,532 --> 00:20:36,467
Shannon.

306
00:20:36,535 --> 00:20:39,561
Shannon. Shannon.

307
00:20:48,013 --> 00:20:49,913
l need to tell you something.

308
00:20:49,982 --> 00:20:51,916
All right.

309
00:20:55,887 --> 00:20:59,414
My brother, Boone,

310
00:20:59,491 --> 00:21:01,823
he's not really my brother.

311
00:21:01,893 --> 00:21:03,224
He's my stepbrother.

312
00:21:04,496 --> 00:21:07,988
Our parents got married
when we were, like, eight and 1 0.

313
00:21:10,569 --> 00:21:13,402
He's kind of in love with me.

314
00:21:15,507 --> 00:21:16,496
ln love with you?

315
00:21:19,745 --> 00:21:22,543
And how do you feel
towards him?

316
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:25,606
l'll always feel something for him,

317
00:21:26,985 --> 00:21:29,886
but am l in love with him
in that way?

318
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:33,254
No. Not at all.

319
00:21:34,893 --> 00:21:37,726
We're here for
God knows how long,

320
00:21:37,796 --> 00:21:39,991
and so is Boone.

321
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:43,791
Maybe we should go back.

322
00:21:46,338 --> 00:21:49,569
- l don't wanna go back.
- Are you sure?

323
00:21:49,641 --> 00:21:51,336
Yes.

324
00:21:54,946 --> 00:21:59,007
l just need to take it
a little slow.

325
00:22:00,519 --> 00:22:03,249
Are you OK with that?

326
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:05,187
l had no expectations.

327
00:22:09,928 --> 00:22:11,020
Right.

328
00:22:12,698 --> 00:22:14,791
Hopes.
Not expectations.

329
00:22:14,866 --> 00:22:16,925
[chuckles]

330
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:19,436
[gasping]

331
00:22:19,504 --> 00:22:21,563
Oh, God, that hurts.

332
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:24,665
[Charlie] Hello?

333
00:22:24,743 --> 00:22:27,268
Hey, Kate. Claire.

334
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:28,745
- ls she OK?
- Where's Jack?

335
00:22:28,814 --> 00:22:30,281
- He couldn't come.
- What?

336
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:33,841
He's pouring his own blood
into Boone's arm right now.

337
00:22:35,053 --> 00:22:37,851
OK, we'll just have to pick her up
and bring her to him.

338
00:22:37,923 --> 00:22:40,118
- No, Kate.
- We have to, before it's too late.

339
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:42,387
[Claire gasps]

340
00:22:42,461 --> 00:22:44,019
Look here.

341
00:22:44,096 --> 00:22:46,826
Jack said you have to
deliver the baby.

342
00:22:46,898 --> 00:22:48,559
- What?
- He talked me through it.

343
00:22:48,633 --> 00:22:50,794
- lt's relatively simple.
- l can't do this.

344
00:22:50,869 --> 00:22:54,532
- Yes, you can. l have water, towels.
- l can't deliver this baby.

345
00:22:54,606 --> 00:22:56,437
Well, somebody bloody has to!

346
00:22:57,576 --> 00:22:59,339
[Claire gasps]

347
00:22:59,411 --> 00:23:03,814
[speaking Korean]

348
00:23:05,817 --> 00:23:08,149
l was out there for over a week,

349
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:10,450
days l can't remember.

350
00:23:10,522 --> 00:23:14,014
l mean, what if they
did something to the baby?

351
00:23:16,928 --> 00:23:18,953
God, l'm not ready for this.

352
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:21,157
l'm not...

353
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:24,031
l'm so scared.

354
00:23:24,102 --> 00:23:27,071
- l'm scared.
- [Kate] Hey.

355
00:23:29,374 --> 00:23:31,467
l'm... l'm scared too.

356
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:36,741
But we're gonna
get through this together.

357
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:40,577
[Kate] OK?

358
00:23:50,495 --> 00:23:52,656
Come on, Boone.

359
00:24:03,809 --> 00:24:04,969
lt's not working.

360
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:10,905
The blood's not the problem.
lt's the leg.

361
00:24:10,982 --> 00:24:15,078
All the blood's pooling there,
compartment syndrome.

362
00:24:15,987 --> 00:24:18,581
He didn't get this injury
from a fall.

363
00:24:18,657 --> 00:24:20,716
Something crushed his leg.

364
00:24:23,862 --> 00:24:27,525
- What are you doing?
- You've given him enough.

365
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:46,481
Hurley.

366
00:24:47,486 --> 00:24:49,351
Whoa. Dude.
You all right, man?

367
00:24:49,421 --> 00:24:52,356
- You're looking kinda goth.
- Look, where's Michael?

368
00:24:52,424 --> 00:24:55,791
- The beach, l think.
- l need you to go get him for me.

369
00:24:55,861 --> 00:24:58,421
- What for?
- Just get him.

370
00:25:12,711 --> 00:25:14,702
Hey, kiddo.

371
00:25:19,885 --> 00:25:22,649
- Hey.
- How's the water?

372
00:25:22,721 --> 00:25:25,986
Oh, it's fantastic.

373
00:25:28,994 --> 00:25:32,521
Screaming kid next to me
in first class.

374
00:25:32,597 --> 00:25:34,258
How does that happen?

375
00:25:42,674 --> 00:25:45,142
What you got there?

376
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:48,976
Oh, Sarah wants us
to write our own vows.

377
00:25:54,085 --> 00:25:58,181
''My heart skips beats
at the sound of your voice,

378
00:25:58,256 --> 00:26:02,488
my skin warms to the touch
of your fingers.

379
00:26:02,561 --> 00:26:06,554
Where you go, l will go...''
Et cetera, et cetera.

380
00:26:07,432 --> 00:26:09,059
This is very nice.

381
00:26:10,769 --> 00:26:12,737
Those aren't my vows.
Those are hers.

382
00:26:12,804 --> 00:26:14,965
l stole them out of the room.

383
00:26:18,109 --> 00:26:20,168
- l can't write mine.
- You're a doctor.

384
00:26:20,245 --> 00:26:22,406
- You're not a writer.
- Right.

385
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:23,970
Right.

386
00:26:30,021 --> 00:26:32,819
Sarah is a beautiful girl.

387
00:26:32,891 --> 00:26:34,381
Hell yeah, she is.

388
00:26:36,361 --> 00:26:38,022
You love her?

389
00:26:39,998 --> 00:26:41,329
Absolutely.

390
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:44,926
Then why are you
sitting out here?

391
00:26:53,912 --> 00:26:57,177
What if l can't be the husband

392
00:26:57,248 --> 00:26:59,614
or the father that l wanna be?

393
00:27:02,754 --> 00:27:04,949
What if l asked her because...

394
00:27:08,026 --> 00:27:10,256
...because l saved her life?

395
00:27:20,271 --> 00:27:22,637
Should l marry her, Dad?

396
00:27:28,213 --> 00:27:30,340
Commitment.

397
00:27:30,415 --> 00:27:33,145
lt's what makes you tick, Jack.

398
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,454
The problem is,

399
00:27:37,522 --> 00:27:39,956
you're just not good
at letting go.

400
00:27:46,331 --> 00:27:48,856
- [Michael] Locke lied?
- [Jack] He didn't fall.

401
00:27:48,933 --> 00:27:51,094
His leg was pinned
under something heavy.

402
00:27:52,637 --> 00:27:54,036
OK, Jack, wait.

403
00:27:54,105 --> 00:27:57,404
The cargo container?
We gotta do this?

404
00:27:57,475 --> 00:27:59,909
- What about the ax?
- l can't use the ax.

405
00:28:01,413 --> 00:28:02,778
[Sun] What are you doing?

406
00:28:06,017 --> 00:28:08,577
His right leg
is filling with blood.

407
00:28:08,653 --> 00:28:10,814
lf l don't stop it,
l won't be able to save him.

408
00:28:11,756 --> 00:28:14,190
- You don't mean the...
- The leg is dead.

409
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:30,169
There's no other choice.

410
00:28:34,446 --> 00:28:36,073
[Kate] Claire?

411
00:28:36,147 --> 00:28:38,945
l think this is the time
you're supposed to push.

412
00:28:39,017 --> 00:28:41,986
So... push.

413
00:28:43,221 --> 00:28:44,711
And...

414
00:28:44,789 --> 00:28:47,781
Don't hold your breath.
You're not gonna be able to push...

415
00:28:48,927 --> 00:28:50,121
Claire?

416
00:28:50,795 --> 00:28:52,057
What are you doing?

417
00:28:54,999 --> 00:28:57,866
Oh, no.
You need to push right now.

418
00:28:57,936 --> 00:29:01,201
Don't do this, OK?
You can't stop this. This is happening.

419
00:29:01,272 --> 00:29:03,365
Your baby is coming,
and l need your help.

420
00:29:06,945 --> 00:29:10,540
- lt's not gonna want me.
- What?

421
00:29:10,615 --> 00:29:13,106
lt knows l don't want it
and l was gonna give it away.

422
00:29:13,184 --> 00:29:15,482
Babies know that stuff.

423
00:29:17,255 --> 00:29:19,155
Do you want this baby now?

424
00:29:23,128 --> 00:29:26,495
Do you want it
to be healthy and safe?

425
00:29:27,799 --> 00:29:30,597
OK. Then the baby
knows that too.

426
00:29:31,436 --> 00:29:33,802
You're not alone in this.
We are all here for you.

427
00:29:36,808 --> 00:29:38,742
This baby is all of ours.

428
00:29:40,345 --> 00:29:44,907
But l need you to push. OK?

429
00:29:44,983 --> 00:29:47,918
OK? OK.

430
00:29:47,986 --> 00:29:50,250
On the count of three. Ready?

431
00:29:50,822 --> 00:29:54,724
One... two... three. Push.

432
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:57,159
Go ahead.
That's good. Push.

433
00:29:59,731 --> 00:30:00,959
[Kate] Good.

434
00:30:03,001 --> 00:30:06,459
- [Kate] Yeah, that's good. Push!
- [Charlie] Yeah. Right. OK.

435
00:30:12,177 --> 00:30:15,169
[coughs]

436
00:30:20,385 --> 00:30:21,716
[Sun] Jack.

437
00:30:21,786 --> 00:30:23,686
[Boone wheezing]

438
00:30:34,299 --> 00:30:37,268
- Let's go.
- Jack.

439
00:30:37,335 --> 00:30:39,667
- On three. One.
- [Sun] Jack.

440
00:30:39,737 --> 00:30:42,433
- Two. Three.
- Why are you doing this?

441
00:30:43,541 --> 00:30:46,942
He's bleeding inside.
You're not helping him.

442
00:30:47,011 --> 00:30:49,741
You can't save him, Jack.
You just can't.

443
00:30:49,814 --> 00:30:51,338
Don't tell me what l can't do!

444
00:30:52,116 --> 00:30:54,311
[Jack] OK.
One, two, three, go.

445
00:30:54,385 --> 00:30:56,376
[Michael grunts]

446
00:30:58,156 --> 00:30:59,487
Ja...

447
00:31:21,613 --> 00:31:22,978
You don't need to see this.

448
00:31:26,484 --> 00:31:30,113
You need me, just shout.

449
00:31:56,814 --> 00:32:00,807
[raspy breathing]

450
00:32:14,699 --> 00:32:16,963
[door scraping]

451
00:32:18,436 --> 00:32:21,371
[Sarah]
...in sickness, in health.

452
00:32:21,439 --> 00:32:24,465
ln good times and bad.

453
00:32:26,511 --> 00:32:30,277
l risk it all,
because l love you.

454
00:32:30,815 --> 00:32:35,252
Thank you, Sarah.
Jack has also prepared his vows.

455
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:38,221
Jack, if you would, please.

456
00:32:49,867 --> 00:32:51,562
Jack?

457
00:32:55,873 --> 00:32:58,808
l didn't write any vows.

458
00:33:00,812 --> 00:33:03,246
l've been trying to
for a month, but...

459
00:33:04,315 --> 00:33:05,942
l couldn't, and...

460
00:33:07,618 --> 00:33:10,951
So l started to wonder
why that was.

461
00:33:11,022 --> 00:33:14,788
And as time went on,
it only got worse.

462
00:33:16,194 --> 00:33:17,991
Because, um...

463
00:33:19,130 --> 00:33:21,121
Because l'm not good
at letting go.

464
00:33:25,536 --> 00:33:28,767
Or maybe l'm afraid
of what will happen if l fail.

465
00:33:32,543 --> 00:33:34,909
But l know one thing.

466
00:33:35,413 --> 00:33:40,214
l would have never been able to write
anything as beautiful as what you said.

467
00:33:41,719 --> 00:33:45,052
And last night, when you were
talking about the accident,

468
00:33:46,391 --> 00:33:48,951
you got it all wrong.

469
00:33:50,661 --> 00:33:52,629
l didn't fix you.

470
00:33:57,869 --> 00:33:59,427
You fixed me.

471
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:04,231
l love you, Sarah...

472
00:34:05,343 --> 00:34:07,174
...and l always will.

473
00:34:09,781 --> 00:34:12,306
[applause, cheering]

474
00:34:32,904 --> 00:34:34,269
[Boone] Wait.

475
00:34:38,676 --> 00:34:40,268
Wait.

476
00:34:41,279 --> 00:34:42,837
l have to.

477
00:34:43,815 --> 00:34:47,080
- lf l don't...
- l'm all mashed up inside.

478
00:34:48,453 --> 00:34:49,886
You know it.

479
00:34:51,756 --> 00:34:54,418
This is our best chance.

480
00:34:56,094 --> 00:34:57,891
There's no chance.

481
00:34:59,030 --> 00:35:01,294
Really.

482
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:06,002
l mean, look where we are.

483
00:35:07,939 --> 00:35:10,066
l'm not gonna let you give up.

484
00:35:13,411 --> 00:35:16,812
l know you made...

485
00:35:16,881 --> 00:35:18,246
...a promise.

486
00:35:21,018 --> 00:35:23,418
l'm letting you off the hook.

487
00:35:33,598 --> 00:35:36,294
Let me go, Jack.

488
00:36:00,458 --> 00:36:03,052
l'm sorry.

489
00:36:05,196 --> 00:36:06,891
Don't be.

490
00:36:11,202 --> 00:36:14,035
Relax, relax. Breathe.
Come on. Breathe.

491
00:36:14,105 --> 00:36:16,437
Breathe. OK. Good.

492
00:36:16,507 --> 00:36:18,805
OK, ready?
You've gotta do a nice one.

493
00:36:18,876 --> 00:36:21,037
l can see it's close.
Go, go. Push!

494
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:25,205
[Kate] That's good.
l think it's close. Come on.

495
00:36:25,583 --> 00:36:29,075
That's it. OK.
Good, good, good.

496
00:36:29,153 --> 00:36:31,678
l can see the top of its head.
You're almost there.

497
00:36:31,756 --> 00:36:34,691
Come on.
l can see it. OK.

498
00:36:34,759 --> 00:36:37,227
You're almost there.
You're so close.

499
00:36:37,295 --> 00:36:40,264
Ready? Ready?
Come on. One more.

500
00:36:41,165 --> 00:36:44,134
Go! Push! Push!
Push! Push! Push!

501
00:36:45,937 --> 00:36:49,873
- [Claire screams]
- Good! Come on!

502
00:36:57,315 --> 00:37:01,547
Oh, my God, you have a little boy.
A little baby boy.

503
00:37:01,619 --> 00:37:04,747
- [baby crying]
- Oh, come here.

504
00:37:13,531 --> 00:37:16,056
Oh! Oh...

505
00:37:16,133 --> 00:37:18,431
That's your baby boy.

506
00:37:21,305 --> 00:37:24,001
[Claire sobbing]

507
00:37:28,346 --> 00:37:31,315
l have a son.
l have a son.

508
00:37:34,252 --> 00:37:38,313
[Charlie, Jin laugh]

509
00:37:38,389 --> 00:37:40,380
Shh...

510
00:37:56,874 --> 00:37:59,274
[wheezing]

511
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:11,188
Tell Shannon...

512
00:38:19,830 --> 00:38:22,230
Tell Shannon...

513
00:38:24,201 --> 00:38:26,567
Tell her l...

514
00:40:26,557 --> 00:40:29,082
[no audible dialogue]

515
00:41:58,616 --> 00:42:00,811
lt's a beautiful, healthy baby.

516
00:42:06,156 --> 00:42:07,487
Wanna talk about it?

517
00:42:08,826 --> 00:42:10,691
Talk about what?

518
00:42:13,464 --> 00:42:15,261
Boone died, Jack.

519
00:42:17,167 --> 00:42:18,896
He didn't die.

520
00:42:21,906 --> 00:42:25,706
- He was murdered.
- What?

521
00:42:25,776 --> 00:42:26,970
Jack.

522
00:42:27,778 --> 00:42:29,905
Where are you going?

523
00:42:29,980 --> 00:42:31,811
To find John Locke.
