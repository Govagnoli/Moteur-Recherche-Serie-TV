1
00:00:06,732 --> 00:00:08,420
Previously on Nip/Tuck...

2
00:00:08,504 --> 00:00:11,214
Give up the porn business or give up the wedding.

3
00:00:11,325 --> 00:00:12,388
Your choice.

4
00:00:12,741 --> 00:00:14,412
This is a dangerous road.

5
00:00:14,504 --> 00:00:17,069
Sean and Christian aren't going to like us seeing each other.

6
00:00:17,145 --> 00:00:19,319
It's time for you to stop caring about what they think.

7
00:00:19,386 --> 00:00:21,992
You're not really leaving me again, are you, sticking me with Quentin?

8
00:00:22,102 --> 00:00:24,560
You know I can't be in this practice with him now.

9
00:00:24,764 --> 00:00:26,447
I guess you'll have to find a way.

10
00:00:37,021 --> 00:00:38,174
Remind me.

11
00:00:38,809 --> 00:00:40,385
Why am I doing this again?

12
00:00:41,007 --> 00:00:42,876
Because you love me.

13
00:00:43,335 --> 00:00:45,931
Because it's my fantasy.

14
00:00:46,876 --> 00:00:50,566
And because my Monique Lhuillier dress is a size zero,

15
00:00:50,651 --> 00:00:55,341
and I am not going to feel like the perfect bride unless I fit into it.

16
00:00:58,049 --> 00:01:00,102
The things you do for love.

17
00:01:03,591 --> 00:01:04,536
Hit it.

18
00:01:38,056 --> 00:01:39,740
Will the bruising be bad?

19
00:01:40,107 --> 00:01:42,631
With micro lipo, there is no bruising.

20
00:01:42,951 --> 00:01:44,566
It should heal in a day or so.

21
00:01:44,663 --> 00:01:48,254
In fact, you will be feeling so good that we could duck out for a quick lunch.

22
00:01:48,358 --> 00:01:50,135
No time for lunch, Christian.

23
00:01:50,228 --> 00:01:52,073
I got to meet with the wedding planner.

24
00:01:53,894 --> 00:01:57,806
Do you think these wedding jitters are making you a little forgetful, sweetheart?

25
00:01:57,886 --> 00:01:59,974
You haven't signed your fidelity pre-nup.

26
00:02:00,068 --> 00:02:01,743
Ok. I'm going to do it.

27
00:02:01,817 --> 00:02:04,756
I know, I'm the one who wanted it. It's just that I haven't had a second.

28
00:02:04,859 --> 00:02:07,565
Which reminds me, you are going to have to do the cake tasting alone.

29
00:02:08,192 --> 00:02:09,268
I'm fasting.

30
00:02:09,698 --> 00:02:10,904
Why are you fasting?

31
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:13,195
Because my dress shows every single molecule of fat.

32
00:02:13,266 --> 00:02:14,859
Which I am removing as we speak.

33
00:02:14,939 --> 00:02:19,953
I know. But at this point, I will gain weight if I even look at cake.

34
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:24,139
What is the point of having a wedding if we can't enjoy this kind of stuff together?

35
00:02:24,828 --> 00:02:27,016
If I gain any of this weight back,

36
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:30,810
nobody's going to be having fun because I'm not gonna be there.

37
00:02:32,328 --> 00:02:35,300
Fine. I'll do the tasting.

38
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:40,517
But just keep in mind if you don't sign that pre-nup

39
00:02:40,603 --> 00:02:44,593
and agree in writing to stop directing double entry gang-bangs,

40
00:02:45,124 --> 00:02:47,312
there won't even be a wedding.

41
00:03:37,961 --> 00:03:40,326
Tell me what you don't like about yourself, Ms. Berg.

42
00:03:40,415 --> 00:03:42,313
I'm her mother, Miriam Berg.

43
00:03:42,432 --> 00:03:44,204
And I was just telling Madison

44
00:03:44,328 --> 00:03:46,815
when I turned 16, my parents just announced,

45
00:03:46,906 --> 00:03:50,038
"if you want to get a husband, you going to have to get your nose done."

46
00:03:50,139 --> 00:03:54,183
My parents big joke is that I wouldn't be here today if it weren't for that nose job.

47
00:03:54,268 --> 00:03:57,645
We know that your mom and dad are all for it, but we haven't heard from you.

48
00:03:57,797 --> 00:03:59,739
Do you want a rhinoplasty?

49
00:04:00,249 --> 00:04:05,371
Well, getting married and having kids is not high on my list of priorities.

50
00:04:05,452 --> 00:04:08,321
I mean, it was for my mom because things were different then.

51
00:04:08,402 --> 00:04:12,727
Well, not all that different. It wasn't like it was the dark ages for god's sake.

52
00:04:13,123 --> 00:04:15,564
Are you happy with your nose, Ms. Berg?

53
00:04:16,268 --> 00:04:19,583
All I know is it's always been a given that I'd be sitting here

54
00:04:19,645 --> 00:04:21,701
a few days before my 16th birthday.

55
00:04:21,798 --> 00:04:24,181
It's about how you feel when you look in the mirror.

56
00:04:24,286 --> 00:04:27,211
It's true that we've done a lot of rhinoplasties on jewish girls,

57
00:04:27,294 --> 00:04:31,773
and the trend is definitely towards a more refined profile.

58
00:04:32,254 --> 00:04:35,041
We can show you some of our work if it helps.

59
00:04:35,754 --> 00:04:39,919
I assume you want to take advantage of our sweet 16 package.

60
00:04:40,207 --> 00:04:41,358
Absolutely.

61
00:04:41,529 --> 00:04:43,509
When I read your ad in the temple newsletter,

62
00:04:43,592 --> 00:04:48,058
it said that you offered a 20% discount on a recovery room at the De La Mer spa.

63
00:04:48,152 --> 00:04:49,966
Oh, my god, it's Lisa Burrows.

64
00:04:50,063 --> 00:04:52,124
She's a senior at my school.

65
00:04:52,289 --> 00:04:55,240
Have you seen her before picture?

66
00:04:57,978 --> 00:05:00,523
Lisa Burrows is jewish?

67
00:05:03,084 --> 00:05:04,082
Ok.

68
00:05:04,817 --> 00:05:05,786
I'm in.

69
00:05:06,655 --> 00:05:08,022
And I want her nose.

70
00:05:21,559 --> 00:05:23,956
Does everyone at this school shop at J. Crew?

71
00:05:25,034 --> 00:05:27,592
You're the only weirdo I have seen so far.

72
00:05:29,544 --> 00:05:31,286
It was a compliment, by the way.

73
00:05:32,214 --> 00:05:35,678
It was? Well, thank you then.

74
00:05:37,891 --> 00:05:39,176
I'm Ariel.

75
00:05:39,661 --> 00:05:41,878
I'm in your american history class.

76
00:05:42,663 --> 00:05:44,303
I'm new at this school.

77
00:05:46,624 --> 00:05:49,621
I'm Matt, the weirdo in the back row.

78
00:05:51,097 --> 00:05:52,591
- Hi.
- Hi.

79
00:05:56,154 --> 00:05:58,596
Uh-oh. Jap, 3:00.

80
00:06:04,797 --> 00:06:09,467
Oh, yeah. She looks like she just got released from the slaughterhouse my dad runs.

81
00:06:10,126 --> 00:06:14,031
He's a plastic surgeon. He does a lot of sweet 16 nose jobs.

82
00:06:14,514 --> 00:06:17,347
Jews with gentile noses and gentile names.

83
00:06:17,445 --> 00:06:19,091
It's completely pathetic.

84
00:06:20,344 --> 00:06:24,626
The bandage on her face isn't covering her nose job. It's broadcasting her self-hate.

85
00:06:24,743 --> 00:06:26,372
And she's not the only one.

86
00:06:26,474 --> 00:06:31,343
I mean, everywhere I look, it's just a sea of pathetic look-alikes and wannabes.

87
00:06:32,778 --> 00:06:38,469
Well, I'm so not like anyone else here, I hardly even notice them, you know?

88
00:06:38,744 --> 00:06:39,953
I like that.

89
00:06:46,268 --> 00:06:49,804
You know, you could really help me out with something.

90
00:06:49,913 --> 00:06:54,060
I'm doing a term paper on homogenizing influences in the melting pot culture.

91
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:57,211
And, uh, it would be cool to talk to a plastic surgeon.

92
00:06:57,645 --> 00:06:59,924
Maybe you could introduce me to your dad?

93
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:16,155
If it will get you to have coffee with me, I will.

94
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:20,058
You had me at "Matt, the weirdo."

95
00:07:25,399 --> 00:07:27,894
I've got to hand it to you. I didn't think it could be done.

96
00:07:27,995 --> 00:07:30,014
I give full credit to Christian.

97
00:07:30,099 --> 00:07:34,182
He just opened up his heart and allowed himself to feel the love.

98
00:07:37,955 --> 00:07:40,493
Mm, you're nice and limber.

99
00:07:40,587 --> 00:07:44,352
It must be from all those kinky positions you have to do for the cum shot.

100
00:07:46,483 --> 00:07:48,539
Actually, I put the blame on Bradley.

101
00:07:48,619 --> 00:07:50,419
He's our private pilates zainer.

102
00:07:50,499 --> 00:07:52,465
He works me and Christian out every morning.

103
00:07:55,404 --> 00:07:57,213
Oh, this is on the house.

104
00:07:57,725 --> 00:07:59,588
I volunteered to be your technician.

105
00:07:59,690 --> 00:08:01,724
Think of it as part of your wedding gift.

106
00:08:01,822 --> 00:08:04,935
Oh, and by the way, I haven't rsvped to your wedding invitation

107
00:08:05,002 --> 00:08:07,809
because I guess there was some kind of mix-up.

108
00:08:07,891 --> 00:08:10,488
You won't be receiving an invitation, Gina.

109
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:14,512
I'm so sorry about that one.

110
00:08:15,342 --> 00:08:17,398
You're going to have some pussy burn.

111
00:08:20,891 --> 00:08:24,763
So, I'm not invited to the wedding.

112
00:08:24,845 --> 00:08:26,798
Put yourself in my shoes, Gina.

113
00:08:26,843 --> 00:08:30,362
We simply can't accommodate all of Christian's ex-lovers.

114
00:08:30,964 --> 00:08:32,489
I need you on all fours.

115
00:08:33,378 --> 00:08:36,829
And I guess with all those scumbags, pimps, and porn stars you've balled,

116
00:08:36,902 --> 00:08:39,449
well, that would be a whole church by itself, wouldn't it?

117
00:08:40,168 --> 00:08:44,662
Oh, did you want me to get the four long dark hairs up your ass?

118
00:08:45,101 --> 00:08:47,982
I was hoping you might be a lady about this, Gina.

119
00:08:48,093 --> 00:08:50,099
You're no lady, and neither am I.

120
00:08:50,192 --> 00:08:53,206
You're just the lucky whore who was in the right place at the right time.

121
00:08:54,894 --> 00:08:55,796
Here.

122
00:08:57,094 --> 00:08:58,452
Put this on your ass.

123
00:08:59,638 --> 00:09:02,877
The truth is I wouldn't marry him now even if he begged me.

124
00:09:02,977 --> 00:09:05,431
Did he tell you that he stopped paying for my aids cocktail?

125
00:09:05,521 --> 00:09:09,593
A way to a man's heart is not entrapping him with your tragedy.

126
00:09:09,686 --> 00:09:12,115
You're the tragedy if you marry him, Kimber.

127
00:09:12,197 --> 00:09:15,541
Christian Troy will never love anyone but the one he can't have,

128
00:09:15,635 --> 00:09:17,354
his precious Julia.

129
00:09:19,552 --> 00:09:20,764
Hello, Kimber.

130
00:09:20,964 --> 00:09:22,337
How is the waxing?

131
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:27,097
Am I interrupting something?

132
00:09:28,447 --> 00:09:29,477
No.

133
00:09:30,468 --> 00:09:31,413
We're done.

134
00:09:34,779 --> 00:09:39,256
I was wondering if you could fill in a customer satisfaction form.

135
00:09:39,989 --> 00:09:41,033
Sure.

136
00:09:41,681 --> 00:09:46,693
And please be honest. We're new, so we welcome any and all criticism.

137
00:09:49,081 --> 00:09:53,972
Actually, I'd like you to be honest with me, Julia.

138
00:09:54,566 --> 00:09:57,203
Is there something you wanted to ask me?

139
00:09:57,465 --> 00:09:59,611
Why didn't you and Christian give it a try?

140
00:10:11,192 --> 00:10:17,065
Honestly, there was once an attraction between us.

141
00:10:17,257 --> 00:10:21,323
And we're still very good and very old friends.

142
00:10:21,411 --> 00:10:23,626
But Christian and I aren't in love.

143
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:27,184
You and Christian are.

144
00:10:31,025 --> 00:10:37,072
You know, I've come a long way since I first fell for that lame pickup line

145
00:10:37,147 --> 00:10:40,235
that he used while trolling for patients in bars.

146
00:10:41,643 --> 00:10:43,177
I can take care of myself.

147
00:10:43,282 --> 00:10:45,640
And I love him.

148
00:10:48,667 --> 00:10:54,738
But I don't wanna give up everything that I have worked so hard for

149
00:10:55,370 --> 00:10:59,907
just to wake up one day to discover that the two of you feel like you missed out

150
00:11:00,369 --> 00:11:02,583
and that you still need to give it a try.

151
00:11:04,567 --> 00:11:06,696
We're not going to give it a try.

152
00:11:07,369 --> 00:11:08,994
It's all in the past.

153
00:11:11,213 --> 00:11:12,343
Thank you.

154
00:11:13,034 --> 00:11:14,623
I needed to hear that.

155
00:11:21,138 --> 00:11:23,226
You know, for what it's worth, Julia,

156
00:11:23,318 --> 00:11:27,883
you and Sean have got to be two of the classiest people I know.

157
00:11:28,678 --> 00:11:31,167
And I told Christian this. Of course he laughed at me.

158
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:35,801
But I have this fantasy that our wedding will bring the two of you back together.

159
00:11:40,901 --> 00:11:44,582
Well, it should just take you a moment to fill in, and

160
00:11:46,782 --> 00:11:48,804
I'll see you at the wedding.

161
00:11:57,988 --> 00:11:59,846
Did you ever think that we'd live to see it?

162
00:11:59,941 --> 00:12:04,917
Me, in a monkey suit, saying "I do" to god and everybody else?

163
00:12:05,004 --> 00:12:06,277
I had my doubts.

164
00:12:08,003 --> 00:12:09,961
Becoming like everybody else.

165
00:12:10,152 --> 00:12:11,781
I'm strangely elated.

166
00:12:12,852 --> 00:12:13,820
How're you doing?

167
00:12:13,912 --> 00:12:14,956
I'm ok.

168
00:12:15,375 --> 00:12:17,527
I'm in kind of a transitional phase.

169
00:12:19,129 --> 00:12:21,082
- Come back to the practice.
- I can't, Christian.

170
00:12:21,163 --> 00:12:23,548
Yes, you can. It doesn't work without you.

171
00:12:23,818 --> 00:12:25,628
We can figured out what to do with Quentin.

172
00:12:26,582 --> 00:12:29,337
Just come back. I miss you.

173
00:12:36,076 --> 00:12:38,889
Just don't say no. That's all I'm asking.

174
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:44,094
Hey.

175
00:12:44,229 --> 00:12:45,804
Hello, Mattie.

176
00:12:47,918 --> 00:12:48,831
How's my little skinhead?

177
00:12:48,918 --> 00:12:51,312
Hey, some people like this look, you know?

178
00:12:53,252 --> 00:12:54,049
Hey.

179
00:12:54,778 --> 00:12:56,363
Maybe I should come back later.

180
00:12:56,459 --> 00:12:59,277
No. No. Stay. It's nice to see you.

181
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:01,020
I should be getting back, anyway.

182
00:13:01,132 --> 00:13:02,797
Will you two kiss and make up already?

183
00:13:02,894 --> 00:13:05,664
In case you missed the memo, I'm the main event right now.

184
00:13:07,066 --> 00:13:08,593
C'mon, sit down.

185
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:23,173
I asked you here because I want you to be my best man.

186
00:13:23,634 --> 00:13:24,705
Both of you.

187
00:13:28,187 --> 00:13:31,776
Well, you wouldn't want a skinhead standing up there, right?

188
00:13:31,867 --> 00:13:34,474
I was teasing, Mattie. Jesus.

189
00:13:35,453 --> 00:13:37,664
Will one of you please say yes?

190
00:13:41,401 --> 00:13:45,035
I'll say yes if you do me a favor.

191
00:13:45,328 --> 00:13:49,384
A friend of mine is doing a term paper, and she wants to interview a plastic surgeon.

192
00:13:49,494 --> 00:13:52,690
If you agree to meet with her, then I'll stand up there with you.

193
00:13:54,202 --> 00:13:55,822
Whatever it takes.

194
00:13:55,964 --> 00:13:58,097
But, you, you have to do the interview with me.

195
00:13:58,347 --> 00:14:01,057
Think of it as a baby step towards coming back to the practice

196
00:14:01,148 --> 00:14:04,300
or an early wedding present for me.

197
00:14:05,118 --> 00:14:07,636
I would be delighted to meet with a friend of Matt's.

198
00:14:07,787 --> 00:14:11,733
So set it up. But stay away from the head clippers until after the wedding.

199
00:14:12,525 --> 00:14:13,367
Deal.

200
00:14:15,664 --> 00:14:18,522
You? Do you think you could put your transitional phase

201
00:14:18,595 --> 00:14:21,157
on hold long enough to remember the rings?

202
00:14:21,396 --> 00:14:22,702
I can do that.

203
00:14:23,663 --> 00:14:27,482
I don't know who's higher maintenance, you two or my bride.

204
00:14:35,963 --> 00:14:38,482
We call this one "Endless Passion."

205
00:14:38,571 --> 00:14:41,403
The vanilla beans are flown in from Tahiti.

206
00:14:42,847 --> 00:14:45,129
This one's a little sweet for my taste buds.

207
00:14:45,379 --> 00:14:46,698
What do you think?

208
00:14:47,172 --> 00:14:49,805
Do you like this one better than the orange coconut rum?

209
00:14:51,533 --> 00:14:52,505
Hello!

210
00:14:52,604 --> 00:14:55,105
Sean, a little feedback here, please.

211
00:14:55,472 --> 00:14:58,609
I'll go get some samples of our chocolate cake. It's not as sweet.

212
00:14:58,714 --> 00:14:59,659
Thanks.

213
00:15:02,027 --> 00:15:06,712
You know, for the life of me, I can't recall the cake-tasting when Julia and I got married.

214
00:15:07,111 --> 00:15:08,467
You're kidding, right?

215
00:15:08,651 --> 00:15:09,652
No.

216
00:15:10,595 --> 00:15:13,557
You can't recall it because you weren't there, Sean.

217
00:15:14,427 --> 00:15:18,033
You wouldn't give up a laser conference in Atlanta.

218
00:15:18,283 --> 00:15:19,458
Don't you remember?

219
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:21,325
You asked me to stand in for you.

220
00:15:24,299 --> 00:15:25,622
And you went.

221
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,123
Yeah.

222
00:15:31,477 --> 00:15:32,875
Right.

223
00:15:34,812 --> 00:15:38,665
You went to the tasting with Julia.

224
00:15:39,577 --> 00:15:41,184
You ate a lot of cake,

225
00:15:41,882 --> 00:15:43,426
drank champagne,

226
00:15:44,456 --> 00:15:47,170
and the rest, as they say,

227
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,674
is history.

228
00:15:56,352 --> 00:15:58,607
Like you said, we drank a lot of champagne.

229
00:16:03,994 --> 00:16:05,686
I need to ask you something.

230
00:16:06,695 --> 00:16:08,932
Since Julia and I split up,

231
00:16:10,078 --> 00:16:14,290
have you and she ever talked about giving it a try?

232
00:16:16,262 --> 00:16:19,241
I don't think we've both ever been single at the same time.

233
00:16:19,332 --> 00:16:20,714
That's not an answer.

234
00:16:20,811 --> 00:16:24,020
I don't harbor any feelings for her, if that's what you're asking.

235
00:16:25,298 --> 00:16:28,472
I wouldn't do that to you... again.

236
00:16:31,264 --> 00:16:32,620
You slept with Kimber.

237
00:16:36,069 --> 00:16:38,876
Do you, you know...

238
00:16:40,764 --> 00:16:41,892
Come on.

239
00:16:42,419 --> 00:16:43,536
No.

240
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:44,454
No?

241
00:16:44,556 --> 00:16:46,326
She's not the girl for me.

242
00:16:46,562 --> 00:16:48,669
I'm sorry. I just have to say something.

243
00:16:48,901 --> 00:16:50,927
I've been doing this for a lot of years,

244
00:16:51,026 --> 00:16:55,400
and you two are the most elegant sharing couple I've ever met.

245
00:16:55,513 --> 00:16:59,534
So honest and so generous in spirit.

246
00:17:08,553 --> 00:17:10,945
Julia's not the one for me, sweetheart.

247
00:17:11,526 --> 00:17:13,101
You're the one I want.

248
00:17:13,261 --> 00:17:15,294
The only one I want.

249
00:17:15,547 --> 00:17:18,332
I love that you love me in that way, baby.

250
00:17:20,126 --> 00:17:22,093
Can I try the chocolate?

251
00:17:29,213 --> 00:17:32,182
Mmm, it's divine.

252
00:17:32,606 --> 00:17:33,843
Delicious.

253
00:17:33,884 --> 00:17:35,330
We fly in the chocolate from belgium.

254
00:17:35,408 --> 00:17:37,573
We call this one "Forever my Love."

255
00:17:37,738 --> 00:17:39,981
- Forever.
- Forever.

256
00:17:50,496 --> 00:17:54,155
Call me old school, but I think a doctor should sit behind a desk,

257
00:17:54,251 --> 00:17:55,848
have a little dignity.

258
00:17:56,571 --> 00:18:00,361
Just say the word and your stuff will come out of storage.

259
00:18:03,822 --> 00:18:08,322
Hey, everyone, this is Ariel Alderman.

260
00:18:08,411 --> 00:18:10,454
Sean McNamara. Good to meet you, Ariel.

261
00:18:10,571 --> 00:18:12,534
Christian Troy. Welcome.

262
00:18:12,664 --> 00:18:14,271
Please have a seat.

263
00:18:14,357 --> 00:18:16,391
I'll--I'll be outside.

264
00:18:21,139 --> 00:18:24,888
Let me guess, you're the biological father.

265
00:18:26,859 --> 00:18:28,576
Actually, he is.

266
00:18:29,778 --> 00:18:33,285
Wow. I'm usually really good at reading facial features.

267
00:18:33,368 --> 00:18:36,891
You have the dark facial features, more like the irish in Matt,

268
00:18:36,967 --> 00:18:40,597
and you look like you have some caribbean blood in you.

269
00:18:40,689 --> 00:18:42,758
The hair, the wider nose.

270
00:18:42,863 --> 00:18:44,785
Was your father from Cuba?

271
00:18:45,678 --> 00:18:49,292
I never had a conversation with my father about his roots.

272
00:18:49,411 --> 00:18:51,585
Anyway, how can we be of help?

273
00:18:52,054 --> 00:18:54,560
I want you to dye my skin black.

274
00:18:56,472 --> 00:18:59,389
Basically, I want to look african-american.

275
00:19:00,432 --> 00:19:01,873
We don't dye people's skin.

276
00:19:01,970 --> 00:19:05,084
No, but you would bleach my skin, wouldn't you?

277
00:19:05,273 --> 00:19:07,578
I thought you were here to do research for a term paper.

278
00:19:07,667 --> 00:19:09,139
This is research.

279
00:19:09,231 --> 00:19:13,169
I'm asking you to address the fact that it's acceptable to make a black person white

280
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:15,384
but not to make a white person black.

281
00:19:15,479 --> 00:19:17,900
Michael jackson is whiter than I am.

282
00:19:17,999 --> 00:19:20,505
We don't treat Michael Jackson.

283
00:19:21,049 --> 00:19:23,178
Ok. Closer to home.

284
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:27,080
Let's talk about the jewish girls who book their sweet-16 nose jobs with you.

285
00:19:27,168 --> 00:19:29,566
What percentage of your income comes directly from their desire

286
00:19:29,656 --> 00:19:32,357
to look like Heidi Klum or Kirsten Dunst--

287
00:19:32,453 --> 00:19:35,397
distinctly anglo-saxon gentile girls?

288
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:39,082
What's your point?

289
00:19:39,176 --> 00:19:41,724
My point is that you are wiping out the physical characteristics

290
00:19:41,806 --> 00:19:44,393
that make up the ethnicities in our culture.

291
00:19:44,487 --> 00:19:47,834
Underlying everything you do is the worship of an archetype.

292
00:19:47,933 --> 00:19:51,335
It's all about making everyone look white and aryan.

293
00:19:51,522 --> 00:19:53,939
That's the topic of my term paper.

294
00:19:54,034 --> 00:19:56,828
That's not correct. We offer people a choice.

295
00:19:56,923 --> 00:19:58,894
We don't have a preference for any particular ethnicity--

296
00:19:58,907 --> 00:20:01,264
Sean, you don't need to defend what we do.

297
00:20:01,351 --> 00:20:02,914
Yes, I think you do.

298
00:20:03,001 --> 00:20:04,828
Little by little, you and all the other plastic surgeons

299
00:20:04,902 --> 00:20:07,889
are just creating a nation of non-white whites.

300
00:20:08,032 --> 00:20:10,646
Does Matt know what you wanted to talk to us about?

301
00:20:10,730 --> 00:20:12,450
Well, he didn't know exactly what I wanted to talk about,

302
00:20:12,529 --> 00:20:14,924
or else he might not have made this introduction.

303
00:20:15,102 --> 00:20:16,579
Let's hope not.

304
00:20:16,997 --> 00:20:20,493
Every time you lipo a big black ass or shave the bump off a jewish nose,

305
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:22,705
or widen a slanty asian eye,

306
00:20:22,796 --> 00:20:25,605
you make that person more viable in a white world.

307
00:20:25,689 --> 00:20:29,835
Then that person marries a white person and they give birth to a mixed-race child.

308
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:32,210
In the long run you're just wiping out the races.

309
00:20:32,293 --> 00:20:35,771
Is that your master plan or is that just an unfortunate by-product

310
00:20:35,833 --> 00:20:37,745
of what you two do for a living?

311
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:43,426
Get your hand off me.

312
00:20:43,579 --> 00:20:45,360
Whoa, whoa, what the hell's going on?

313
00:20:45,445 --> 00:20:48,619
Your fathers asked me to leave, Matt. They're very defensive about their work.

314
00:20:48,699 --> 00:20:49,522
What'd you say to her?

315
00:20:49,610 --> 00:20:52,877
I don't know who this girl is to you, Matt, but she's not who you think she is.

316
00:20:52,952 --> 00:20:55,882
I asked intelligent, well-researched questions, but they didn't want to deal with it.

317
00:20:55,964 --> 00:20:58,264
They just want their own point of view parroted back at them.

318
00:20:58,309 --> 00:20:59,612
I feel bad for you, Matt.

319
00:21:03,416 --> 00:21:06,586
Don't you even think about bringing that little freak to my wedding.

320
00:21:06,836 --> 00:21:08,614
- I can't believe this.
- Believe it.

321
00:21:08,685 --> 00:21:10,677
Why would you want somebody like that in your life, Matt?

322
00:21:10,758 --> 00:21:11,617
She's a racist.

323
00:21:11,709 --> 00:21:13,794
You're a judgmental asshole.

324
00:21:13,951 --> 00:21:16,086
I guess some things never change, right?

325
00:21:34,748 --> 00:21:36,062
What's this?

326
00:21:37,558 --> 00:21:39,102
It's Thor's hammer.

327
00:21:39,202 --> 00:21:41,200
It's a norse pagan symbol.

328
00:21:46,039 --> 00:21:48,209
Is that a swastika on it?

329
00:21:49,882 --> 00:21:52,180
It's one of the world's oldest symbols.

330
00:21:56,041 --> 00:21:58,625
Don't tell me you're gonna freak out about it.

331
00:21:59,531 --> 00:22:02,204
People are so ignorant about it.

332
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:09,072
Well, it's got some pretty evil connotations, Ariel.

333
00:22:10,610 --> 00:22:14,525
It's on buddhist prayer wheels and native american amulets.

334
00:22:17,055 --> 00:22:18,298
See, look.

335
00:22:19,027 --> 00:22:20,777
It's 4 Ls.

336
00:22:23,190 --> 00:22:28,153
Light, love, life, and luck.

337
00:22:28,787 --> 00:22:30,398
My dad gave it to me.

338
00:22:31,329 --> 00:22:33,205
He's very, very smart.

339
00:22:40,085 --> 00:22:48,902
You're, uh, you're not into some kind of neo-nazi, racist kind of trip, are you?

340
00:22:50,986 --> 00:22:57,067
No. But I believe that people shouldn't disguise themselves and hide their identities.

341
00:22:57,306 --> 00:23:01,213
I mean, I don't hide who I am,

342
00:23:01,581 --> 00:23:07,722
and I would like to know if someone is asian or jewish or what their real gender is.

343
00:23:09,055 --> 00:23:13,975
And oh, my god, those sex-change operations that plastic surgeons do?

344
00:23:14,367 --> 00:23:16,347
Did your fathers do any of those?

345
00:23:18,715 --> 00:23:20,646
Yeah, I think they did.

346
00:23:21,614 --> 00:23:23,456
That to me is truly immoral.

347
00:23:23,539 --> 00:23:26,887
Playing with something that's as sacred as someone's sex, playing god,

348
00:23:26,979 --> 00:23:29,575
and spreading disease and fear.

349
00:23:30,168 --> 00:23:32,378
I'm not a nazi, Matt.

350
00:23:34,304 --> 00:23:36,171
But I am a purist.

351
00:23:40,834 --> 00:23:42,513
You're fierce,

352
00:23:44,079 --> 00:23:45,835
and you're beautiful.

353
00:24:01,332 --> 00:24:03,378
I want to do something.

354
00:24:05,233 --> 00:24:06,543
Do you trust me?

355
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:10,521
Yeah.

356
00:24:42,619 --> 00:24:43,862
Are you ready?

357
00:25:17,479 --> 00:25:18,473
Hey, baby.

358
00:25:22,054 --> 00:25:23,097
What you looking at?

359
00:25:25,453 --> 00:25:27,001
The royal wedding.

360
00:25:29,208 --> 00:25:30,386
Is that Julia?

361
00:25:36,006 --> 00:25:38,993
I got us some champagne and caviar

362
00:25:39,075 --> 00:25:43,492
so that we could have a relaxing evening before the big day.

363
00:25:45,212 --> 00:25:47,088
What made you check out this album?

364
00:25:47,936 --> 00:25:49,061
I don't know.

365
00:25:49,622 --> 00:25:50,792
Wedding fever.

366
00:25:53,977 --> 00:25:56,333
I don't want any champagne and caviar, Christian.

367
00:25:56,460 --> 00:25:57,889
I told you I'm fasting.

368
00:25:58,471 --> 00:26:02,084
Although, you not remembering shouldn't surprise me.

369
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:06,955
Well, you're in some mood, sweetheart, and it's not very attractive.

370
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:11,568
Well, don't worry, I won't be around much longer to bring you down.

371
00:26:11,667 --> 00:26:13,470
I'm gonna go stay in a hotel.

372
00:26:13,746 --> 00:26:14,838
Why?

373
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:18,081
Because I was looking at old pictures of me in a cheap suit?

374
00:26:18,189 --> 00:26:19,826
That's not what you were looking at.

375
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:33,430
Sweetheart, this was supposed to be a lovely evening.

376
00:26:33,686 --> 00:26:37,415
I was gonna bathe the bride in a soapy shower,

377
00:26:37,646 --> 00:26:40,407
give her a little massage,

378
00:26:40,605 --> 00:26:46,107
and just when she was letting go of all of that wedding stress,

379
00:26:46,245 --> 00:26:50,702
I was gonna slip my hand between her delectable size zero thighs and--

380
00:26:50,712 --> 00:26:52,131
Ok, ok, ok, could you just--

381
00:26:52,771 --> 00:26:56,976
You were all misty-eyed over those photos of Julia, Christian.

382
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:58,804
Be honest.

383
00:26:59,995 --> 00:27:01,745
Jesus, Kimber.

384
00:27:02,530 --> 00:27:05,868
Why the jealous fit, I mean, tonight of all nights?

385
00:27:08,063 --> 00:27:10,909
I'm the one who should be pissed. You haven't even signed your pre-nup.

386
00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:14,168
Uh, yeah.

387
00:27:16,299 --> 00:27:18,274
God damn it, why are you leaving?

388
00:27:19,591 --> 00:27:23,790
I'm going to a hotel because if I stay here, I'm just gonna end up having sex with you.

389
00:27:24,894 --> 00:27:28,536
And I want to feel like a virgin tomorrow, like a real bride.

390
00:27:28,642 --> 00:27:30,563
Pure and untouched.

391
00:27:33,284 --> 00:27:35,253
The kind you wish I was.

392
00:27:44,205 --> 00:27:47,678
This one is my prize. I just got it on ebay.

393
00:27:48,022 --> 00:27:54,040
Yeah. Honestly, Mrs. Alderman, I don't understand the appeal of this stuff.

394
00:27:54,118 --> 00:27:56,713
You know, I mean, it just seems kind of demeaning, you know,

395
00:27:56,804 --> 00:27:59,457
a big, fat black lady in an apron.

396
00:27:59,545 --> 00:28:01,111
To mom, it's just a piece of americana.

397
00:28:01,207 --> 00:28:02,714
Yeah. It's from another time.

398
00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:04,638
It's before they wanted to look like us.

399
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:07,377
You know, blacks were blacks, and the women enjoyed their size.

400
00:28:07,471 --> 00:28:10,691
See? She's happy to be large. She holds more cookies.

401
00:28:10,786 --> 00:28:14,210
Sue, will you quit boring this kid and put dinner on the table?

402
00:28:14,301 --> 00:28:15,890
Ariel, help your mother.

403
00:28:15,987 --> 00:28:17,971
Uh, Matt, this is my dad.

404
00:28:18,916 --> 00:28:20,755
Ah! Hey, I'm with you, Matt.

405
00:28:20,850 --> 00:28:24,217
If I was black, I wouldn't want to be memorialized as a cookie jar.

406
00:28:25,399 --> 00:28:29,910
So, Matt, you know, after Ariel told us about you,

407
00:28:29,998 --> 00:28:32,112
I did a research and guess what I found out about you?

408
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:34,336
Oh, god. I hate when he does this.

409
00:28:36,624 --> 00:28:39,523
You were involved in a pretty brutal gay-bashing, hmm?

410
00:28:41,299 --> 00:28:43,215
- What?
- Yeah.

411
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:45,800
Your friend here took down a transsexual.

412
00:28:46,014 --> 00:28:49,977
What did he/she do, make a pass at you?

413
00:28:54,134 --> 00:28:55,977
Yes, sir, that's right.

414
00:29:00,594 --> 00:29:02,441
How did you find out?

415
00:29:02,653 --> 00:29:04,497
Well, I've got a friend in the department.

416
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:07,880
I run a check on anyone that Ariel brings home.

417
00:29:07,973 --> 00:29:09,611
Helps me sleep at night.

418
00:29:11,207 --> 00:29:15,606
So is this where my dinner invitation disappears?

419
00:29:15,705 --> 00:29:18,065
This is where I tell you...

420
00:29:19,883 --> 00:29:24,705
that you have always got a place at this table.

421
00:29:26,650 --> 00:29:27,946
- Really?
- Yep.

422
00:29:29,231 --> 00:29:31,529
You were tricked in the worst possible way, hmm?

423
00:29:31,614 --> 00:29:33,039
And you still stood up for yourself.

424
00:29:33,136 --> 00:29:37,270
You behaved like a man, and that takes balls, by the way.

425
00:29:37,468 --> 00:29:42,534
Boy, those trannies can be mean, and they travel in packs.

426
00:29:42,624 --> 00:29:46,075
Oh, dad, did I tell you that Matt's father is a plastic surgeon?

427
00:29:48,913 --> 00:29:57,347
Ah! So now then, you grew up with all that liberal, multicultural, polysexual doublespeak,

428
00:29:57,444 --> 00:30:00,201
and you still turned out to be a man of honor, huh?

429
00:30:00,969 --> 00:30:03,763
Well, now I'm truly impressed. Broccoli?

430
00:30:04,358 --> 00:30:05,326
Thank you.

431
00:30:08,554 --> 00:30:11,177
Did my daughter give you that?

432
00:30:11,328 --> 00:30:12,736
I pierced it for him.

433
00:30:12,777 --> 00:30:13,439
Yeah?

434
00:30:15,926 --> 00:30:19,907
Matt, I've got a job for you,

435
00:30:21,090 --> 00:30:22,992
and I think you're up to it.

436
00:30:23,124 --> 00:30:26,674
Well, I think you may be overestimating me, sir.

437
00:30:26,897 --> 00:30:29,748
He's never had a son. He's always looking for a protege.

438
00:30:29,905 --> 00:30:32,838
And that is a typically off-point remark, Sue.

439
00:30:35,933 --> 00:30:37,156
Jeez.

440
00:30:37,749 --> 00:30:44,805
Now, do you think that you could get me the patient files from your father's office?

441
00:30:45,631 --> 00:30:50,924
Matt, do you know what the phrase "mental duress" is? Hmm?

442
00:30:51,010 --> 00:30:54,533
That is when people claim that their mental health

443
00:30:54,616 --> 00:30:57,199
is being jeopardized by something that they don't like about themselves,

444
00:30:57,286 --> 00:30:59,575
and then they get their insurance companies to pay for it.

445
00:30:59,670 --> 00:31:04,407
It's why jews get their noses fixed, gays get their organs lopped off,

446
00:31:04,503 --> 00:31:08,326
and me and a lot of other hardworking guys like me who don't have time

447
00:31:08,414 --> 00:31:14,501
for "mental duress" end up picking up the tab in higher premiums.

448
00:31:15,425 --> 00:31:21,420
Now... look, one of these days, you'll have a family of your own.

449
00:31:22,374 --> 00:31:23,508
Dad.

450
00:31:24,597 --> 00:31:30,620
And you're gonna have to choose between a bike for your kid or health insurance.

451
00:31:31,085 --> 00:31:34,311
Unless, of course, you follow in your father's footsteps.

452
00:31:34,414 --> 00:31:36,568
That's not gonna happen.

453
00:31:39,177 --> 00:31:44,429
Um, wait. How do the files help?

454
00:31:44,514 --> 00:31:47,897
Look, they tell us which of these health insurance companies

455
00:31:47,973 --> 00:31:50,509
are most lenient with these elective surgeries,

456
00:31:50,581 --> 00:31:54,702
and then we use that information to put pressure on the government.

457
00:31:54,791 --> 00:31:57,144
I'll go and help you for support.

458
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:59,721
Look, I don't know.

459
00:32:03,708 --> 00:32:09,898
Look, my problem is, this is my family we're talking about here.

460
00:32:11,731 --> 00:32:12,910
You know what?

461
00:32:14,884 --> 00:32:16,481
I respect that.

462
00:32:17,829 --> 00:32:19,602
And I think Sue may be right.

463
00:32:20,454 --> 00:32:24,765
I think I see a kindred spirit in there.

464
00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:29,491
Maybe even a friendship down the road, hmm?

465
00:32:29,853 --> 00:32:31,997
Forgive me. I got ahead of myself.

466
00:32:34,509 --> 00:32:35,363
Here.

467
00:32:37,914 --> 00:32:40,343
"What an incredible journey it's been,

468
00:32:40,451 --> 00:32:44,140
watching you grow from that pretty but slightly shallow girl

469
00:32:44,229 --> 00:32:47,752
to a deep, beautiful, powerful woman.

470
00:32:48,317 --> 00:32:51,297
You inspire me every day with your dignity, Kimber.

471
00:32:51,962 --> 00:32:54,450
Your capacity for unconditional love, your patience--"

472
00:32:54,543 --> 00:32:55,805
Why would she fly off the handle like this?

473
00:32:55,834 --> 00:32:58,514
It's temporary, Christian. Brides can be irrational.

474
00:32:58,651 --> 00:33:00,382
So, about your vows.

475
00:33:00,505 --> 00:33:03,975
You might leave out the part where you call her a "slightly shallow girl."

476
00:33:05,751 --> 00:33:07,196
- Right.
- Yeah.

477
00:33:07,314 --> 00:33:08,228
Got a pen?

478
00:33:11,921 --> 00:33:12,955
Hey!

479
00:33:14,153 --> 00:33:17,673
Sorry I'm late. I had to pick up my tux at the rental place.

480
00:33:18,176 --> 00:33:20,984
Why would you wait until an hour before the ceremony?

481
00:33:21,372 --> 00:33:24,000
I want to be here for you, Christian, but it's kind of hard

482
00:33:24,023 --> 00:33:26,230
when you're all bent out of shape and superior.

483
00:33:26,316 --> 00:33:30,115
No, no, no. What's kind of hard is when your son/best man

484
00:33:30,185 --> 00:33:33,920
shows up at your wedding in storm trooper boots and skinhead jewelry.

485
00:33:34,008 --> 00:33:35,093
Why are you being such a little shit?

486
00:33:35,164 --> 00:33:36,689
All right, calm down, calm down.

487
00:33:36,777 --> 00:33:40,287
We'll find him some shoes and he can take off his earring.

488
00:33:40,381 --> 00:33:42,127
Is that a fair compromise?

489
00:33:48,861 --> 00:33:51,129
Why should I have to compromise?

490
00:33:51,231 --> 00:33:52,806
This is who I am.

491
00:33:54,335 --> 00:33:56,118
Why isn't it good enough?

492
00:33:56,318 --> 00:33:58,893
When it's your wedding, you can dress in drag for all I care,

493
00:33:58,977 --> 00:34:02,596
but today is my day and I call the shots.

494
00:34:04,948 --> 00:34:07,278
So I guess I'm not good enough to be in your wedding.

495
00:34:07,373 --> 00:34:10,113
Dressed up like a goddamn Jerry Springer guest? You betcha.

496
00:34:10,220 --> 00:34:11,350
Come on, Christian.

497
00:34:11,447 --> 00:34:12,671
No, it's ok.

498
00:34:14,702 --> 00:34:17,194
Actually, it's a relief to be kicked out of your wedding.

499
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:21,020
Standing up for a self-important, hypocritical asshole such as yourself

500
00:34:21,101 --> 00:34:23,525
is the last thing in the world I want to do.

501
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:38,348
It's very sweet of you to be so good about all of this.

502
00:34:38,435 --> 00:34:39,925
It's all good, Julia.

503
00:34:40,064 --> 00:34:43,798
I don't want to be at Christian's wedding, especially as I wasn't invited.

504
00:34:45,363 --> 00:34:46,654
Good to see you. Thanks for coming.

505
00:34:49,742 --> 00:34:52,232
Enjoy yourself, and call me when you're done.

506
00:34:52,319 --> 00:34:54,462
We can have our own post-wedding party.

507
00:35:12,941 --> 00:35:14,401
What a coincidence.

508
00:35:16,641 --> 00:35:18,105
We're both wearing white.

509
00:35:18,265 --> 00:35:19,582
What are you doing here, Gina?

510
00:35:19,847 --> 00:35:22,614
Hoping I'd get cold feet so you could step in for me?

511
00:35:22,717 --> 00:35:25,998
I just had to drop off a little something for the bride.

512
00:35:29,514 --> 00:35:32,133
It would mean a lot to me if you opened it now.

513
00:35:33,792 --> 00:35:37,118
Picking out the perfect wedding gift was no easy feat, Kimmy.

514
00:35:37,210 --> 00:35:40,811
You know, I thought, she's got something new--her tits;

515
00:35:40,907 --> 00:35:42,737
the groom is borrowed, since sooner or later,

516
00:35:42,812 --> 00:35:44,919
he'll return to the women of greater Miami-dade;

517
00:35:45,006 --> 00:35:46,856
and as for something blue, well,

518
00:35:46,944 --> 00:35:49,576
there will be plenty of blue days living with the world's biggest asshole,

519
00:35:49,685 --> 00:35:53,038
so all that's missing is something old.

520
00:35:57,381 --> 00:35:59,416
What the hell is this?

521
00:35:59,507 --> 00:36:00,780
My old diaphragm.

522
00:36:00,884 --> 00:36:02,085
Oh, my god.

523
00:36:02,167 --> 00:36:03,933
It's the one I used with Christian.

524
00:36:04,078 --> 00:36:05,973
You don't want to get pregnant, Kimber.

525
00:36:06,074 --> 00:36:08,730
Sooner or later, he's gonna leave.

526
00:36:08,832 --> 00:36:10,732
Did he do this to you?

527
00:36:11,429 --> 00:36:15,755
All this bitterness as a result of loving him too much?

528
00:36:15,913 --> 00:36:19,778
No. I was always a bitch.

529
00:36:32,657 --> 00:36:34,154
Oh, Jesus.

530
00:36:35,024 --> 00:36:37,765
I didn't think I had the power to upset you this badly.

531
00:36:37,870 --> 00:36:40,503
I'm so afraid I'm making a mistake, Gina.

532
00:36:42,417 --> 00:36:44,767
I'm giving up everything for him.

533
00:36:45,204 --> 00:36:48,310
My career, merchandising.

534
00:36:49,322 --> 00:36:52,270
I haven't eaten in days so I can fit into this dress.

535
00:36:52,362 --> 00:36:56,067
It just seems like I'm trying to disappear so he'll accept me.

536
00:36:56,181 --> 00:37:00,847
What if I just turn into nothing at all and then I'm just gonna end up losing him anyway.

537
00:37:01,082 --> 00:37:04,121
Well, you might have thought of that before the invitations went out.

538
00:37:06,282 --> 00:37:09,589
Oh, you need to fix your eye makeup.

539
00:37:11,512 --> 00:37:14,441
You have to go out there soon, and you look like Courtney Love.

540
00:37:15,482 --> 00:37:16,661
Close.

541
00:37:24,551 --> 00:37:26,999
Now, for all the shit I say about you two--

542
00:37:28,368 --> 00:37:30,793
I hope I don't choke on these words, but

543
00:37:33,259 --> 00:37:35,078
Christian loves you, Kimber.

544
00:37:36,292 --> 00:37:38,012
You just need to believe it.

545
00:37:40,059 --> 00:37:40,999
Open.

546
00:37:46,482 --> 00:37:48,998
I guess I needed a good cry.

547
00:37:50,141 --> 00:37:50,961
Thanks.

548
00:37:55,135 --> 00:37:57,213
You look really pretty, Kimber.

549
00:37:57,782 --> 00:37:58,895
Thank you.

550
00:37:59,145 --> 00:38:00,912
Not as pretty as me, though.

551
00:38:08,642 --> 00:38:10,292
The door was open.

552
00:38:10,899 --> 00:38:13,127
I just wanted to wish you luck.

553
00:38:16,931 --> 00:38:17,763
Thanks.

554
00:38:19,037 --> 00:38:20,148
I could use it.

555
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:23,819
Who tied this? Sean?

556
00:38:26,001 --> 00:38:27,257
Have you seen Kimber?

557
00:38:27,313 --> 00:38:31,147
She was so cuckoo last night, I wouldn't be surprised if she doesn't even show up.

558
00:38:33,556 --> 00:38:35,840
There's a part of me that wishes she was halfway around the world

559
00:38:35,888 --> 00:38:37,164
and I could just tell everybody else to go home.

560
00:38:37,206 --> 00:38:40,306
You're out of luck. I saw her on my way in.

561
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:44,221
Everyone is terrified before their wedding, Christian.

562
00:38:44,371 --> 00:38:48,282
You know that cliche about life flashing before your eyes when you die?

563
00:38:48,367 --> 00:38:50,641
Well, the same is true of weddings.

564
00:38:50,797 --> 00:38:56,145
Every reason a marriage is wrong and impossible rises to the surface.

565
00:38:56,323 --> 00:38:59,700
That's why there's so much champagne at weddings.

566
00:39:01,094 --> 00:39:03,235
That's why you slept with me,

567
00:39:04,478 --> 00:39:05,523
isn't it?

568
00:39:07,930 --> 00:39:14,354
All my fears about Sean got turned into the need to find out if you were really the one.

569
00:39:14,477 --> 00:39:16,138
There's still something...

570
00:39:19,547 --> 00:39:24,322
something unresolved between us after all these years.

571
00:39:24,442 --> 00:39:27,696
Sleeping together didn't resolve anything.

572
00:39:28,266 --> 00:39:32,573
We simply made a mistake that many people paid dearly for.

573
00:39:33,015 --> 00:39:37,232
I think we have to look at these feelings as being the demons

574
00:39:37,307 --> 00:39:41,430
that surface when we try and do something good for ourselves.

575
00:39:41,889 --> 00:39:44,599
Marrying Kimber is very good.

576
00:39:44,689 --> 00:39:46,396
I wanted to marry you.

577
00:39:46,401 --> 00:39:47,533
It wouldn't have worked.

578
00:39:47,613 --> 00:39:48,818
What if we're meant to be together?

579
00:39:48,901 --> 00:39:53,094
What if the demons you're talking about are keeping us from being happy.

580
00:39:53,195 --> 00:39:55,993
Your bride is beautiful and waiting for you.

581
00:39:56,089 --> 00:39:58,368
You're gonna go out there and get married.

582
00:39:58,454 --> 00:40:01,326
Julia, we've been here before.

583
00:40:01,417 --> 00:40:07,251
Maybe--maybe--maybe destiny is in the second chance.

584
00:40:31,450 --> 00:40:34,929
It feels the same as it did 17 years ago.

585
00:40:38,484 --> 00:40:40,268
It was just a kiss, Christian.

586
00:40:40,354 --> 00:40:41,713
Some kiss.

587
00:40:44,048 --> 00:40:49,992
It's my wedding present to you so that you can let it go forever.

588
00:40:54,333 --> 00:40:59,177
I am not going to let you ruin your life.

589
00:41:01,692 --> 00:41:03,528
Like I ruined yours?

590
00:41:04,175 --> 00:41:05,241
No.

591
00:41:07,558 --> 00:41:11,267
Christian, Kimber asked me to walk her down the aisle. Are you ok with that?

592
00:41:11,441 --> 00:41:12,540
Hello, Julia.

593
00:41:14,129 --> 00:41:15,661
Hey, Sean.

594
00:41:16,254 --> 00:41:18,177
Wow. You look fantastic.

595
00:41:18,597 --> 00:41:20,028
We all do.

596
00:41:21,935 --> 00:41:27,432
So much water under the bridge, and here we are, still standing.

597
00:41:27,551 --> 00:41:30,333
Still pretty fantastic.

598
00:41:35,702 --> 00:41:37,173
Let's toast us.

599
00:41:45,014 --> 00:41:48,864
To survival with grace.

600
00:42:23,938 --> 00:42:25,099
Coming, Sean.

601
00:44:29,477 --> 00:44:30,715
I did love her.

602
00:44:32,731 --> 00:44:34,023
I know you did.

603
00:44:42,963 --> 00:44:45,215
I don't know. Maybe I'll always be alone.

604
00:44:45,603 --> 00:44:49,887
Maybe that's just the way it's meant to be.

605
00:44:52,276 --> 00:44:57,308
You know, you've never really been alone.

606
00:44:58,193 --> 00:44:59,517
Really?

607
00:45:01,479 --> 00:45:05,254
My bride left me at the altar, my partner left me for a midlife crisis.

608
00:45:05,340 --> 00:45:09,152
Am I missing something?

609
00:45:12,952 --> 00:45:15,158
I can help you with one of those things.

610
00:45:19,761 --> 00:45:21,715
I'd like to come back to the practice.

611
00:45:24,703 --> 00:45:25,730
You mean that?

612
00:45:27,007 --> 00:45:28,141
I do.

613
00:45:55,538 --> 00:45:58,704
