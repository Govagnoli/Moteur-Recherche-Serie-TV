1
00:00:01,604 --> 00:00:03,084
Previously on Nip/Tuck...

2
00:00:07,008 --> 00:00:08,228
Did he rape you?

3
00:00:08,409 --> 00:00:09,349
No.

4
00:00:13,492 --> 00:00:17,362
We've given our lives for this family. You don't have the right to walk out on it.

5
00:00:17,405 --> 00:00:18,499
Watch me.

6
00:00:19,564 --> 00:00:20,880
Oh, no.

7
00:00:21,516 --> 00:00:22,984
Oh, my god.

8
00:00:26,807 --> 00:00:29,609
Tell me what you don't like about yourself, Mrs. Harkness.

9
00:00:29,707 --> 00:00:32,042
My husband treats me like a stranger.

10
00:00:32,452 --> 00:00:34,238
We do good work here, but

11
00:00:34,688 --> 00:00:38,222
we can't promise to save our patients from insensitive spouses.

12
00:00:38,704 --> 00:00:40,940
No, I mean it literally.

13
00:00:41,027 --> 00:00:45,293
My husband has alzheimer's. He doesn't recognize me anymore.

14
00:00:49,384 --> 00:00:51,769
Do you think you could make me look like this?

15
00:00:53,653 --> 00:00:57,421
This is the woman he remembers, the woman he loves.

16
00:00:57,523 --> 00:01:00,626
He took that photo on our 20th wedding anniversary.

17
00:01:00,703 --> 00:01:04,200
Do you think you could make me look like this again? Maybe it would jog his memory.

18
00:01:04,262 --> 00:01:05,572
Here's my problem.

19
00:01:06,134 --> 00:01:09,321
It would take several surgeries to recreate this face,

20
00:01:09,382 --> 00:01:10,786
and they'd all have to be done at once

21
00:01:10,861 --> 00:01:13,759
if you're racing against your husband's mental deterioration.

22
00:01:13,831 --> 00:01:16,565
We'd have to put you out for many hours, and, frankly,

23
00:01:16,627 --> 00:01:20,221
we don't like to keep patients your age under anesthesia for that long.

24
00:01:20,298 --> 00:01:22,851
Additionally, after all that work,

25
00:01:23,647 --> 00:01:26,016
- you still run the risk of his--
- Oh, I know. I know.

26
00:01:26,139 --> 00:01:28,310
He might not recognize me.

27
00:01:28,418 --> 00:01:30,138
I've been all through that.

28
00:01:31,404 --> 00:01:33,230
It's worth the risk.

29
00:01:36,006 --> 00:01:38,514
I never said this out loud before,

30
00:01:40,358 --> 00:01:42,279
but it's my fault.

31
00:01:42,492 --> 00:01:43,899
I know it is.

32
00:01:44,198 --> 00:01:47,465
He's forgotten me because I abandoned him.

33
00:01:47,613 --> 00:01:50,270
Most of our marriage, I was all about Carl.

34
00:01:50,341 --> 00:01:54,576
And then, after menopause, I got this sudden surge of energy,

35
00:01:54,628 --> 00:01:57,653
and I just started writing these little murder mysteries.

36
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:01,749
And Carl was very supportive of me. He even read my drafts for me,

37
00:02:01,796 --> 00:02:05,722
but then when he expressed feelings of missing me,

38
00:02:05,803 --> 00:02:09,006
I was pretty much, "don't rain on my parade."

39
00:02:09,091 --> 00:02:12,967
And then I called home one night I was on a book tour in London,

40
00:02:13,033 --> 00:02:16,055
and he claimed not to know who I was.

41
00:02:17,642 --> 00:02:20,069
He said his wife had run away,

42
00:02:21,901 --> 00:02:27,319
and I became angry, and I told him his sense of humor was very passive aggressive.

43
00:02:27,324 --> 00:02:30,970
And then, 3 days later, my son called and told me

44
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,981
that they found him wandering in the neighborhood in his pajama bottoms,

45
00:02:36,069 --> 00:02:41,757
filthy and dehydrated, and he couldn't remember which house was his.

46
00:02:41,946 --> 00:02:45,730
And, basically, he's never recognized me again.

47
00:02:48,144 --> 00:02:50,001
I am so sorry.

48
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:56,862
Doctor, have you ever hurt anyone you loved

49
00:02:56,985 --> 00:03:00,297
in such a way that doesn't even seem like you?

50
00:03:01,065 --> 00:03:06,590
But then you can't go back and make it different.

51
00:03:16,221 --> 00:03:19,456
It's a kind of pain I never could've imagined.

52
00:03:30,148 --> 00:03:32,549
I don't suppose there's any way I can convince you

53
00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:35,759
to come with me and meet him, and see how it is with us?

54
00:03:35,806 --> 00:03:40,782
Mrs. Harkness, you seem like a lovely woman, and I'm moved by your situation.

55
00:03:40,848 --> 00:03:45,066
If I could convince myself it was medically sound, I'd do the work in a heartbeat.

56
00:03:45,151 --> 00:03:49,372
But I can't justify taking that big a risk with so little certainty.

57
00:03:51,207 --> 00:03:58,051
Well... thank you for your time and your honesty.

58
00:04:03,633 --> 00:04:04,804
Dr. McNamara?

59
00:04:04,866 --> 00:04:05,685
Yeah?

60
00:04:06,177 --> 00:04:07,376
You got served.

61
00:04:26,552 --> 00:04:30,047
Can we just order in? I'm not feeling very social tonight.

62
00:04:31,946 --> 00:04:33,243
Let me call you back.

63
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:38,760
What's going on?

64
00:04:41,111 --> 00:04:43,870
Matt just served me with a restraining order.

65
00:04:45,985 --> 00:04:50,298
I'm not to contact him or come within 200 yards of him.

66
00:05:58,225 --> 00:05:59,279
Coming!

67
00:06:01,742 --> 00:06:02,715
Where's Matt?

68
00:06:03,262 --> 00:06:05,208
I've asked you to call first, Sean.

69
00:06:05,259 --> 00:06:06,963
What do you know about this restraining order?

70
00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:08,064
Restraining order?

71
00:06:08,102 --> 00:06:11,157
He took out a goddamn restraining order against me. Don't act surprised.

72
00:06:11,217 --> 00:06:13,047
He didn't say a word to me.

73
00:06:13,124 --> 00:06:16,088
But, I mean, frankly, Sean, I'm not that surprised.

74
00:06:19,059 --> 00:06:20,675
You're breaking the law.

75
00:06:21,004 --> 00:06:25,225
Matt, we got to talk.

76
00:06:25,274 --> 00:06:27,346
We're family. We don't treat each other like criminals.

77
00:06:27,397 --> 00:06:30,182
You should've thought of that before you acted like one.

78
00:06:30,225 --> 00:06:33,367
Or didn't you know it was against the law to beat your children.

79
00:06:33,495 --> 00:06:35,217
I came to apologize.

80
00:06:36,661 --> 00:06:41,186
Matt, I lie in bed at night reliving that moment when I hit you.

81
00:06:41,203 --> 00:06:43,096
Social services told me you'd probably show up

82
00:06:43,142 --> 00:06:45,329
and try to manipulate me into dropping the charges.

83
00:06:45,395 --> 00:06:48,717
They also said that if you do that, I should report you.

84
00:06:52,358 --> 00:06:56,539
They said these events are never isolated, and you know what? They're right.

85
00:06:56,547 --> 00:06:59,106
I told them how you almost choked mom 

86
00:06:59,197 --> 00:07:01,906
when she told you about Christian being my father.

87
00:07:01,928 --> 00:07:03,526
How do you know about that?

88
00:07:04,562 --> 00:07:06,524
Why would you do that?

89
00:07:12,434 --> 00:07:14,841
Did you tell them about your own violence, Matt?

90
00:07:15,521 --> 00:07:18,147
You think you can ignore your own behavior by demonizing me?

91
00:07:18,154 --> 00:07:19,202
Cutting me out of your life?

92
00:07:19,224 --> 00:07:20,408
That's another thing they said. 

93
00:07:20,424 --> 00:07:23,708
Abusers always try to make you think that they're the victim.

94
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:26,816
Yeah, hi. I'd like to report somebody who's in viola--

95
00:07:27,170 --> 00:07:28,847
I think you should go now, Sean.

96
00:07:28,925 --> 00:07:30,635
I'm here to... please--

97
00:07:30,647 --> 00:07:33,124
It doesn't Matter why you came here. This is about Matt.

98
00:07:33,185 --> 00:07:35,618
- You need to leave now, Sean.
- This is vindictive.

99
00:07:35,716 --> 00:07:38,080
Look, I understand your pain.

100
00:07:38,102 --> 00:07:41,337
But until you can express it without frightening us, you're not welcome here.

101
00:07:41,408 --> 00:07:45,831
This is machiavellian bullshit! You're setting me up to get sole custody of the kids.

102
00:07:54,541 --> 00:07:57,547
You should have told me about the restraining order.

103
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:25,856
Remind me, why do we bother to repair her

104
00:08:25,918 --> 00:08:30,449
when she's only gonna do it to herself all over again when bikini season is over?

105
00:08:30,464 --> 00:08:33,059
I dated a woman who was into self-injury.

106
00:08:33,274 --> 00:08:36,259
She said she felt some kind of release afterwards.

107
00:08:36,307 --> 00:08:37,740
Release from what?

108
00:08:37,810 --> 00:08:39,336
Emotional pain, in her case.

109
00:08:39,408 --> 00:08:41,250
Her father was an abusive bastard.

110
00:08:42,736 --> 00:08:46,039
It makes a weird poetic kind of sense to me.

111
00:08:46,131 --> 00:08:50,790
You treat one kind of pain with another. External injuries are manageable.

112
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:56,084
I mean, they can be seen and treated, whereas emotional pain is elusive and shapeless.

113
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:59,432
Is this surgery or open mic night at the lesbian coffee bar?

114
00:09:02,305 --> 00:09:05,930
Um, I thought you should know. There's been another carver victim.

115
00:09:06,881 --> 00:09:09,504
She just called. I put her on the books.

116
00:09:38,781 --> 00:09:41,933
I referred the carver victim to Ian Saks.

117
00:09:42,201 --> 00:09:45,072
I politely explained that we had handled our share of cases,

118
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:46,824
and that he does very good work.

119
00:09:48,093 --> 00:09:49,864
That's probably for the best.

120
00:09:59,108 --> 00:10:05,066
You know, it's occurred to me that we haven't really talked since the beach.

121
00:10:06,459 --> 00:10:07,913
How's the counseling going?

122
00:10:07,978 --> 00:10:09,903
How are you feeling about that restraining order?

123
00:10:09,964 --> 00:10:13,724
I feel shitty and pretty goddamn hopeless. Your turn.

124
00:10:15,736 --> 00:10:19,295
I didn't take the counseling route, Sean. I've been fine.

125
00:10:20,294 --> 00:10:23,831
Except for some physical issues I thought would abate over time.

126
00:10:24,425 --> 00:10:27,388
Anyway, I hope they find him soon.

127
00:10:27,405 --> 00:10:29,134
What kind of physical issues?

128
00:10:29,142 --> 00:10:31,747
Don't we have a brachioplasty in 30 minutes?

129
00:10:31,769 --> 00:10:33,271
You haven't answered the question.

130
00:10:33,344 --> 00:10:35,484
My asshole is killing me, ok?

131
00:10:35,501 --> 00:10:38,049
It hurts when I stand, when I sit, when I shit.

132
00:10:38,268 --> 00:10:40,631
In fact, it hurts just about all the time.

133
00:10:40,665 --> 00:10:42,093
Glad you asked?

134
00:10:42,599 --> 00:10:44,520
Have you seen a proctologist?

135
00:10:48,156 --> 00:10:50,357
You're still the only one that knows, Sean.

136
00:10:52,733 --> 00:10:54,740
Then let me examine you.

137
00:10:56,042 --> 00:10:59,394
I think that pretty much defines the word "inappropriate."

138
00:11:00,128 --> 00:11:01,863
What's the big deal?

139
00:11:02,021 --> 00:11:05,400
What part of you being or having an asshole could shock me?

140
00:11:21,201 --> 00:11:22,881
Breathe out, Christian.

141
00:11:32,393 --> 00:11:34,098
I don't see anything at all.

142
00:11:37,913 --> 00:11:39,382
No fissures? No...

143
00:11:40,586 --> 00:11:42,046
Not even hemorrhoids?

144
00:11:42,977 --> 00:11:43,816
Nothing.

145
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:51,128
I'm not an expert, but

146
00:11:51,988 --> 00:11:56,611
my guess is that this is some kind of phantom pain.

147
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,334
Who do you call for phantom pain?

148
00:12:00,425 --> 00:12:01,715
Ghostbusters?

149
00:12:01,917 --> 00:12:06,405
Emotional trauma can be experienced as physical pain.

150
00:12:06,504 --> 00:12:10,014
That's not just new age mumbo jumbo.

151
00:12:10,072 --> 00:12:16,405
In other words, if I embrace my inner pain, my pain in the ass will go away.

152
00:12:32,090 --> 00:12:36,246
I've been dreading the inevitable moment when I'd hear about the next victim.

153
00:12:37,075 --> 00:12:39,993
How would I feel? Would I come apart?

154
00:12:40,633 --> 00:12:45,681
And now here she is, needing to be healed just like me.

155
00:12:48,276 --> 00:12:49,757
And I'm avoiding it.

156
00:12:58,053 --> 00:12:59,994
I think this is an opportunity.

157
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:02,025
I want to treat her.

158
00:13:04,589 --> 00:13:05,968
I don't know about that.

159
00:13:06,048 --> 00:13:07,181
It's exactly what I need. 

160
00:13:07,238 --> 00:13:11,481
If I help her through her pain, I can experience my own.

161
00:13:11,543 --> 00:13:12,843
Let it go.

162
00:13:13,918 --> 00:13:18,546
I think that's something we both need to work on, Sean.

163
00:13:28,656 --> 00:13:32,216
Pick up the phone, Matt. Please.

164
00:13:33,226 --> 00:13:37,060
Don't pretend I'm not here. We have to talk.

165
00:13:37,752 --> 00:13:39,949
This is the wrong way to--

166
00:13:42,842 --> 00:13:46,517
I've been to see 3 other surgeons. They all turned me down.

167
00:13:46,566 --> 00:13:50,455
I came back to you because I know you're an understanding soul.

168
00:13:50,477 --> 00:13:52,728
I am very sympathetic, Mrs. Harkness--

169
00:13:52,745 --> 00:13:56,288
Come with me to meet Carl. No promises.

170
00:13:56,424 --> 00:14:00,797
Just an hour out of your life that might change mine completely.

171
00:14:12,522 --> 00:14:14,759
Carl? You have visitors.

172
00:14:14,807 --> 00:14:17,969
Hi, sweetheart. I brought somebody to meet you.

173
00:14:18,241 --> 00:14:22,546
This is Dr. Sean McNamara. This is Carl.

174
00:14:22,753 --> 00:14:24,155
Good to meet you, Carl.

175
00:14:27,319 --> 00:14:29,152
Would you join us over here?

176
00:14:33,504 --> 00:14:35,265
Has he eaten anything today?

177
00:14:35,337 --> 00:14:39,510
No, and if he doesn't start eating soon, we're gonna have to put him on an I.V.

178
00:14:39,596 --> 00:14:43,166
We don't wanna do that, do we Carl?

179
00:14:49,817 --> 00:14:54,330
Carl? I brought you a guava pastry.

180
00:14:57,092 --> 00:14:58,813
You look worried, Carl.

181
00:14:59,375 --> 00:15:01,080
I don't know her.

182
00:15:01,429 --> 00:15:05,355
Carl, I'm your wife Ellie, and I come every day,

183
00:15:05,432 --> 00:15:10,270
and today I've brought you your favorite pastry from Alba's. Remember Alba's?

184
00:15:10,309 --> 00:15:15,851
We used to walk there every day, and we'd get a cortadito and a guava pastry.

185
00:15:22,190 --> 00:15:24,069
I just keep trying.

186
00:15:24,577 --> 00:15:27,106
I don't know what else to do.

187
00:15:28,561 --> 00:15:32,051
Carl, your wife worries about you.

188
00:15:32,084 --> 00:15:34,658
She wants you to eat more so you keep your strength up.

189
00:15:34,711 --> 00:15:36,347
Do you know my wife?

190
00:15:43,246 --> 00:15:45,379
She's the love of my life.

191
00:15:51,078 --> 00:15:53,161
She never comes to see me.

192
00:15:59,142 --> 00:16:03,132
You must be very lonely without your family, Carl.

193
00:16:09,429 --> 00:16:11,861
Just one little bite, sweetheart. Come on.

194
00:16:11,923 --> 00:16:16,022
If you'll excuse me, you two. I'm in the middle of a movie.

195
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:27,871
I'm so grateful you took me on.

196
00:16:27,927 --> 00:16:31,516
It's the least we could do, Ms. Reynolds.

197
00:16:32,321 --> 00:16:38,274
Sorry. Dr. McNamara had another appointment, and he asked me to sit in.

198
00:16:40,605 --> 00:16:42,928
Hi, I'm Dr. Costa.

199
00:16:42,952 --> 00:16:46,272
I was just telling Dr. Troy how you've all been so amazing

200
00:16:46,334 --> 00:16:48,417
in the work you've done on the victims.

201
00:16:48,484 --> 00:16:52,427
Oh, well, that is the dirty little secret we doctors share.

202
00:16:52,493 --> 00:16:53,916
It feels good to help others.

203
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:57,454
Oh, I couldn't agree more.

204
00:16:57,837 --> 00:17:02,420
After I gave my statement to the police, I picked up the phone and I called stand up.

205
00:17:02,498 --> 00:17:04,331
You know, the victims' rights group?

206
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:05,934
You've heard of them?

207
00:17:06,173 --> 00:17:08,221
Yes, of course.

208
00:17:08,436 --> 00:17:10,531
They do such good work.

209
00:17:10,627 --> 00:17:14,320
Anyway, a lady came right over. She stayed with me all night.

210
00:17:14,388 --> 00:17:18,165
She herself had been brutally stabbed by her husband 16 times,

211
00:17:18,236 --> 00:17:20,442
so she knew how to relate to me.

212
00:17:20,549 --> 00:17:21,918
How fortunate.

213
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:28,323
She told me this quote. "Victims are but little lower than the angels."

214
00:17:28,379 --> 00:17:33,427
She was saying we don't need to be desTroyed souls, that god has chosen us,

215
00:17:33,508 --> 00:17:37,241
given us an opportunity to come back stronger,

216
00:17:37,284 --> 00:17:40,293
more compassionate than ever before.

217
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:46,662
I think this attack may have been the miracle I've been looking for all my life.

218
00:17:49,162 --> 00:17:51,686
- Miracle?
- It gave me purpose.

219
00:17:51,754 --> 00:17:54,082
After you fix me, I'm going to take the training program,

220
00:17:54,128 --> 00:17:57,148
and dedicate my life to helping other people.

221
00:17:57,399 --> 00:17:59,463
A word of advice, Ms. Reynolds.

222
00:17:59,504 --> 00:18:03,416
Don't quit your job before you've landed back on planet earth.

223
00:18:05,847 --> 00:18:10,160
I'm sorry. Have I offended you, Dr. Troy?

224
00:18:10,512 --> 00:18:15,990
No, I'm just uncomfortable with all this transformation rhetoric.

225
00:18:16,063 --> 00:18:18,253
It feels like you're avoiding something.

226
00:18:18,275 --> 00:18:20,042
I'm avoiding helplessness.

227
00:18:20,087 --> 00:18:25,713
I'm afraid my colleague played hooky during the bedside manner course in med school.

228
00:18:28,729 --> 00:18:32,745
Ms. Reynolds, shall we move on to the surgery?

229
00:18:37,475 --> 00:18:42,399
Based on your cardio work-up, 5 hours is the maximum time I want you under.

230
00:18:42,476 --> 00:18:47,192
So I've chosen these procedures for optimum results in a limited time frame.

231
00:18:47,212 --> 00:18:48,580
Are you sure you want to hear all this?

232
00:18:48,621 --> 00:18:51,748
I'd say 90% of our patients prefer to remain in the dark.

233
00:18:51,815 --> 00:18:55,251
This surgery is my life now. I thrive on every detail.

234
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:56,602
Ok.

235
00:18:57,109 --> 00:19:01,963
We start with the fat deposits and skin over the eyelids.

236
00:19:10,048 --> 00:19:12,957
We won't take out all of it since we know from the photo

237
00:19:12,967 --> 00:19:15,414
you've always had slightly hooded eyes.

238
00:19:21,745 --> 00:19:24,633
We'll just cut along the loose skin here.

239
00:19:24,701 --> 00:19:27,940
My Prada bags, as my daughter-in-law calls them.

240
00:19:45,668 --> 00:19:49,778
That leaves us about 3 hours and 15 minutes for your rhytidectomy.

241
00:20:00,857 --> 00:20:04,478
Rhytidectomy sounds like a wild animal in Africa.

242
00:20:04,519 --> 00:20:06,700
Not quite. It's your face lift.

243
00:20:25,691 --> 00:20:31,697
After the incision, we use a tissue expander to make the skin more supple.

244
00:20:37,732 --> 00:20:40,430
And then, my favorite part of the procedure,

245
00:20:40,478 --> 00:20:44,551
we use blood we've taken from you earlier, and turn it into a natural glue.

246
00:20:52,242 --> 00:20:55,963
I hold it in place for 3 minutes. It closes all the dead space,

247
00:20:55,984 --> 00:20:59,646
and aids in natural tissue healing because it's from your own body.

248
00:21:04,111 --> 00:21:05,247
Any questions?

249
00:21:07,023 --> 00:21:08,365
Just one.

250
00:21:09,338 --> 00:21:12,461
Are you this kind to all your patients?

251
00:21:13,864 --> 00:21:18,718
You asked me if I ever hurt someone close to me in a way I deeply regret.

252
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:22,656
I'm like you.

253
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:26,422
I wanna believe in second chances.

254
00:21:44,042 --> 00:21:50,794
Ms. Reynolds, before I send you off to surgery, I owe you an apology.

255
00:21:51,224 --> 00:21:52,668
Because you don't like me?

256
00:21:52,751 --> 00:21:54,916
I have nothing against you. You need to know that.

257
00:21:55,019 --> 00:21:58,813
I'd like to make a contribution to your victims' rights organization.

258
00:21:58,864 --> 00:22:00,062
Thank you.

259
00:22:04,618 --> 00:22:10,501
I also feel an obligation to tell you the truth about something.

260
00:22:11,295 --> 00:22:13,651
I was also a victim of the carver.

261
00:22:15,466 --> 00:22:20,295
Oh, god. I had no idea.

262
00:22:21,095 --> 00:22:25,082
Listening to your story was difficult for me.

263
00:22:27,117 --> 00:22:33,940
It was hard for me to accept how remarkably you've dealt with your attack,

264
00:22:33,963 --> 00:22:37,801
when I'm still resentful and struggling with residual issues.

265
00:22:37,878 --> 00:22:41,314
I was harsh, and I'm sorry.

266
00:22:45,436 --> 00:22:46,593
Are you all right?

267
00:22:46,743 --> 00:22:48,752
I don't think I can talk about it.

268
00:22:50,177 --> 00:22:52,710
Would you mind if we don't talk about it?

269
00:22:53,823 --> 00:22:57,647
I'm sorry, I thought you said talking about it made you feel better.

270
00:22:57,709 --> 00:23:02,766
It's just when I start to talk about it, I feel... really sick.

271
00:23:03,729 --> 00:23:06,909
Um, I feel for your pain, you know?

272
00:23:08,605 --> 00:23:13,693
But I have to take care of myself. I'm about to go into surgery here. I can't get all emotional.

273
00:23:15,868 --> 00:23:17,154
Of course.

274
00:23:24,102 --> 00:23:28,593
Now, about my face, I wanted to ask you something about my nose.

275
00:23:28,976 --> 00:23:30,604
I've always hated it.

276
00:23:30,738 --> 00:23:34,066
Do you think you could make it prettier, since I'm gonna be under anyway?

277
00:23:35,028 --> 00:23:39,262
After everything you've been through, I'd say rhinoplasty is the last thing you need.

278
00:23:39,305 --> 00:23:42,478
What about my lips? Could we plump them up or something?

279
00:23:45,191 --> 00:23:52,595
Ms. Reynolds, I think we should discuss elective surgery at a later date.

280
00:24:02,405 --> 00:24:05,375
Daddy, we do they call it "high tea"?

281
00:24:07,018 --> 00:24:10,125
I don't know, sweetheart. We'll have to ask the waiter.

282
00:24:12,139 --> 00:24:14,514
Good afternoon. We're from family services.

283
00:24:14,556 --> 00:24:17,918
I'm Ms. James, this is Mr. Riskin. Are you Mr. McNamara?

284
00:24:18,016 --> 00:24:20,791
Dr. McNamara. How can I help you?

285
00:24:20,872 --> 00:24:23,673
Well, we received a call from one of our domestic violence centers

286
00:24:23,735 --> 00:24:27,089
reporting an incident involving you and your son.

287
00:24:27,841 --> 00:24:31,867
This isn't a good time. My daughter and I are on our way out.

288
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:36,284
When one of these reports come in, we're required by law to question other family children.

289
00:24:36,351 --> 00:24:38,374
We'll need to speak with your daughter.

290
00:24:38,691 --> 00:24:40,030
What's your name?

291
00:24:40,181 --> 00:24:42,541
Anne Katherine McNamara.

292
00:24:43,165 --> 00:24:45,915
How's your hearing? Now's not a good time.

293
00:24:45,932 --> 00:24:49,289
Now's the only time, mister-- Dr. McNamara.

294
00:24:49,317 --> 00:24:52,371
We need to determine whether or not action has to be taken.

295
00:24:52,438 --> 00:24:54,481
Action? What are you talking about? What action?

296
00:24:54,507 --> 00:24:57,552
We need to determine whether or not your daughter is at risk by staying with you,

297
00:24:57,599 --> 00:25:00,277
so it would be helpful if you cooperate.

298
00:25:07,247 --> 00:25:10,665
Where is a good place for your daughter and I to speak privately?

299
00:25:11,726 --> 00:25:14,696
Sweetheart, you and Ms. James go into my bedroom.

300
00:25:15,207 --> 00:25:16,185
It's ok.

301
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:25,432
Does your daddy ever get mad, Anne?

302
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:30,757
Does it frighten you?

303
00:25:33,751 --> 00:25:37,966
Of course, I get angry. Don't you? Is getting angry against the law?

304
00:25:38,749 --> 00:25:42,564
Anne, I'm gonna have to check your body for bruises now.

305
00:25:42,675 --> 00:25:45,368
I told you he never hit me! Never!

306
00:25:45,407 --> 00:25:47,775
Your son said you almost killed your wife.

307
00:25:47,873 --> 00:25:51,826
He says there's a dent in the refrigerator door where her head hit it.

308
00:25:51,847 --> 00:25:53,136
Tell me about that.

309
00:25:53,448 --> 00:25:55,051
What are you trying to prove here?

310
00:25:55,128 --> 00:25:56,997
How'd you get this bruise, Anne?

311
00:25:57,432 --> 00:25:58,794
Playing soccer.

312
00:25:59,786 --> 00:26:01,783
Don't! That hurts!

313
00:26:01,886 --> 00:26:04,907
Ow! Stop!

314
00:26:06,101 --> 00:26:07,780
What are you doing to my daughter?!

315
00:26:08,308 --> 00:26:10,536
I told her you didn't hit me, daddy.

316
00:26:10,590 --> 00:26:14,619
She has a contusion on her left thigh, her right shin, and a scab by her right elbow.

317
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:16,539
She plays soccer, you moron!

318
00:26:16,657 --> 00:26:20,447
You get your hands off my daughter, you get out of my house! Both of you!

319
00:26:20,550 --> 00:26:23,760
I'm afraid it's not gonna be that easy, Dr. McNamara.

320
00:26:36,279 --> 00:26:38,074
How'd the apology go?

321
00:26:39,273 --> 00:26:41,644
She's lying. She made the whole thing up.

322
00:26:41,656 --> 00:26:44,173
Rhea Reynolds is not a victim of the carver.

323
00:26:44,990 --> 00:26:47,361
What are you suggesting, her cat did it?

324
00:26:48,048 --> 00:26:49,672
My best guess?

325
00:26:50,351 --> 00:26:53,199
It's a unique presentation of munchausen's syndrome.

326
00:26:53,266 --> 00:26:55,662
She did it to herself to get attention.

327
00:26:56,456 --> 00:26:58,001
Munchausen's.

328
00:26:58,405 --> 00:27:00,004
And you would know this because...

329
00:27:00,021 --> 00:27:02,204
Because she asked me to do her nose.

330
00:27:04,423 --> 00:27:08,420
Well, I wouldn't call that munchausen's. I would call that realistic self-assessment.

331
00:27:08,478 --> 00:27:09,523
I think we should do it.

332
00:27:09,583 --> 00:27:10,756
You don't get it.

333
00:27:10,859 --> 00:27:14,857
"Beauty is a curse on the world." That's what the carver says to his victims.

334
00:27:14,929 --> 00:27:19,654
He's looking to deface beauty. She doesn't have an attractive feature anywhere.

335
00:27:19,737 --> 00:27:21,743
Have you called Kit about your theory?

336
00:27:22,219 --> 00:27:25,773
Detective McGraw is no longer on my speed dial.

337
00:27:27,964 --> 00:27:33,151
Christian, just because she isn't feeling the same pain as yours

338
00:27:33,222 --> 00:27:35,685
doesn't mean hers isn't legitimate.

339
00:28:08,266 --> 00:28:09,877
What's going on here?

340
00:28:09,969 --> 00:28:11,766
I'll let Fric and Frac fill you in.

341
00:28:11,874 --> 00:28:15,760
Hello, Mrs. McNamara. Lynn James, child protective services.

342
00:28:15,836 --> 00:28:17,665
As your husband mentioned to you on the phone, we came by today

343
00:28:17,710 --> 00:28:21,694
to talk to your daughter. It's mandated by your son's restraining order.

344
00:28:21,771 --> 00:28:23,577
Where there's been violence in a home, we wanna make sure

345
00:28:23,634 --> 00:28:26,025
there aren't any other children who are being victimized.

346
00:28:26,118 --> 00:28:29,584
But you didn't find any victims here, so what's this about?

347
00:28:29,625 --> 00:28:32,677
Well, we determined that your daughter's significantly affected

348
00:28:32,733 --> 00:28:34,657
by her father's anger problem.

349
00:28:34,705 --> 00:28:36,528
I never said that!

350
00:28:36,686 --> 00:28:42,455
I assure you, Mrs. McNamara, we are trained to detect subtleties and unspoken fears.

351
00:28:43,342 --> 00:28:46,459
Uh, go get your stuff, sweetheart.

352
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:55,426
You have no right to put our daughter through this.

353
00:28:55,501 --> 00:28:58,144
She has no fears, unspoken or otherwise.

354
00:28:58,181 --> 00:29:01,354
Sometimes it's hard to see these things when you're close to them.

355
00:29:01,425 --> 00:29:03,468
It's our job to protect the children.

356
00:29:03,506 --> 00:29:04,565
You already said that.

357
00:29:04,651 --> 00:29:07,339
Excuse me, but do either of you even have children?

358
00:29:07,401 --> 00:29:08,782
Here's the bottom line.

359
00:29:08,855 --> 00:29:12,044
Until Mr. McNamara completes a course in anger management,

360
00:29:12,101 --> 00:29:17,323
or the restraining order is magically rescinded, Anne must not be left alone with him.

361
00:29:17,396 --> 00:29:20,334
I really can't believe this!

362
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:23,533
Easy, Julia. Can't have 2 violent parents.

363
00:29:27,712 --> 00:29:30,082
Say good-bye to daddy, sweetheart.

364
00:29:38,019 --> 00:29:40,931
I didn't say anything bad, daddy.

365
00:29:41,043 --> 00:29:44,398
You believe me, right?

366
00:29:49,595 --> 00:29:51,843
It's not your fault, baby.

367
00:30:10,061 --> 00:30:11,898
Will there be much pain afterwards?

368
00:30:11,964 --> 00:30:14,053
'Cause after what that monster did to me...

369
00:30:14,807 --> 00:30:17,274
I don't know how much more I can stand.

370
00:30:17,316 --> 00:30:22,342
I think it's safe to say that you'll only be mildly uncomfortable, ok?

371
00:30:31,892 --> 00:30:34,666
Count backwards from 10 for me, ok, Rhea?

372
00:30:34,754 --> 00:30:39,577
10, 9, 8--

373
00:30:45,015 --> 00:30:46,540
Change of heart, doctor?

374
00:30:46,622 --> 00:30:48,584
This is still McNamara/Troy.

375
00:30:48,706 --> 00:30:53,596
However they were caused, this patient's scars need to be addressed.

376
00:31:16,483 --> 00:31:19,795
Ellie? What are you doing?

377
00:31:19,818 --> 00:31:21,429
I got anxious.

378
00:31:21,801 --> 00:31:22,842
What were you thinking?

379
00:31:22,858 --> 00:31:27,342
I don't know. I just woke up and all I could think about

380
00:31:27,403 --> 00:31:30,634
was how many days I'd have to be away from Carl.

381
00:31:31,162 --> 00:31:34,510
So you thought you'd make time fly by ripping out your jut?

382
00:31:34,608 --> 00:31:36,911
You've torn some of your stitches out.

383
00:31:38,228 --> 00:31:40,589
There's a healing phase. It's crucial.

384
00:31:40,665 --> 00:31:42,636
You can't just skip to the good part.

385
00:31:42,709 --> 00:31:43,988
Life isn't like that.

386
00:31:44,081 --> 00:31:50,014
I've been fighting time so long. It just suddenly got the best of me.

387
00:31:57,161 --> 00:31:59,102
Oh, I'm so embarrassed.

388
00:31:59,144 --> 00:32:02,113
How badly have I screwed up your beautiful work?

389
00:32:02,256 --> 00:32:03,746
I can fix it.

390
00:32:03,891 --> 00:32:06,659
But am I gonna have to put you on a 24-hour watch?

391
00:32:11,304 --> 00:32:13,704
Am I just full of drugs, or

392
00:32:14,314 --> 00:32:17,608
didn't you tell me you were gonna spend today with your daughter?

393
00:32:18,021 --> 00:32:19,331
It's, um...

394
00:32:23,038 --> 00:32:25,480
difficult with my family at the moment.

395
00:32:29,064 --> 00:32:31,793
I guess it'll take a while to heal.

396
00:32:34,194 --> 00:32:37,030
The real pain is in the waiting, isn't it?

397
00:32:40,257 --> 00:32:42,130
That looks that way.

398
00:32:57,211 --> 00:32:59,933
My toes are cold. I can feel 'em.

399
00:33:00,635 --> 00:33:02,969
When does the anesthesia kick in?

400
00:33:10,552 --> 00:33:14,818
W-w-wait! Wait a minute! That burns.

401
00:33:17,710 --> 00:33:19,548
Why am I feeling this?

402
00:33:20,230 --> 00:33:21,407
Check it out.

403
00:33:27,718 --> 00:33:30,854
Oh, my god! What are you doing?!

404
00:33:30,937 --> 00:33:32,404
Stop! Please!

405
00:33:32,472 --> 00:33:33,936
It isn't a clean cut.

406
00:33:34,043 --> 00:33:36,384
There's avulsion of the underlying tissue 

407
00:33:36,391 --> 00:33:38,026
- and maceration.
- I can feel this!

408
00:33:38,334 --> 00:33:42,404
Jesus. This must've been done with a serrated knife.

409
00:33:42,482 --> 00:33:44,514
Stop! Please!

410
00:33:44,652 --> 00:33:48,523
You'll have to excise a wider margin of tissue to get rid of those jagged edges.

411
00:33:50,724 --> 00:33:53,340
The carver never used a serrated knife before, did he?

412
00:33:53,412 --> 00:33:54,980
I thought he liked precision.

413
00:33:55,026 --> 00:33:57,580
I told you, she did this to herself.

414
00:33:58,128 --> 00:34:00,417
Looks like she used a grapefruit knife.

415
00:34:00,453 --> 00:34:03,181
Who cares what it was, shithead?!

416
00:34:17,590 --> 00:34:22,064
Stop! I can feel it! I can feel the pain!

417
00:34:22,141 --> 00:34:25,182
I can't take it! I can't take it anymore!

418
00:34:30,206 --> 00:34:32,171
Stop! Please!

419
00:34:32,832 --> 00:34:34,449
I can feel this!

420
00:34:36,493 --> 00:34:39,928
I can--stop! I can feel it!

421
00:34:40,001 --> 00:34:44,075
I can feel the pain! Aaaahh!

422
00:34:44,464 --> 00:34:47,138
Aaaaaah!

423
00:34:47,659 --> 00:34:50,583
Aaaaaah!

424
00:35:01,714 --> 00:35:04,858
I'm representing Ms. Reynolds in her suit against McNamara/Troy.

425
00:35:04,924 --> 00:35:09,531
She was traumatized during her surgery, and she called me. I do pro bono work for stand up.

426
00:35:09,609 --> 00:35:10,869
Traumatized in what sense?

427
00:35:10,941 --> 00:35:12,788
I told you, I felt the whole thing.

428
00:35:12,865 --> 00:35:13,797
Every second.

429
00:35:13,869 --> 00:35:16,823
My client didn't receive proper anesthesia during her procedure.

430
00:35:16,885 --> 00:35:18,718
She was awake during the operation.

431
00:35:18,795 --> 00:35:19,705
That's not possible.

432
00:35:19,763 --> 00:35:22,174
She claims she was paralyzed and unable to communicate with you.

433
00:35:22,261 --> 00:35:24,109
She's lying. She does that a lot.

434
00:35:24,166 --> 00:35:25,721
My client has no reason to lie, Dr. Troy.

435
00:35:25,773 --> 00:35:28,875
She's clearly suffering from post traumatic stress disorder and is thus entitled

436
00:35:28,938 --> 00:35:32,768
to financial restitution for the pain and suffering inflicted on her on these premises.

437
00:35:32,829 --> 00:35:35,025
Your client is not just a liar, Mr. Baerwitz,

438
00:35:35,091 --> 00:35:37,959
she is a fountain of grisly, insane fabrications.

439
00:35:38,024 --> 00:35:39,402
I am onto you.

440
00:35:39,474 --> 00:35:42,259
You just want our money so you can run off and book that nose job

441
00:35:42,307 --> 00:35:44,533
and that breast augmentation that you've been dying for.

442
00:35:44,605 --> 00:35:46,188
Let me be clear.

443
00:35:46,258 --> 00:35:49,376
We will not give you one dime.

444
00:35:49,417 --> 00:35:50,990
You hate me.

445
00:35:51,091 --> 00:35:52,796
You've always hated me.

446
00:35:52,863 --> 00:35:54,911
Excuse me. Ms. Reynolds, why don't you--

447
00:35:54,993 --> 00:35:58,418
Please, just tell us in your own words what you experienced during the surgery.

448
00:35:58,510 --> 00:36:02,171
He did it to me because he wants everyone to suffer just like he did.

449
00:36:02,248 --> 00:36:03,098
He admitted it.

450
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:05,074
All right, let's just try to remain as rational as we can here.

451
00:36:05,102 --> 00:36:07,379
Let's just stick with the facts. All of us.

452
00:36:07,445 --> 00:36:09,406
Here are the facts, doctor.

453
00:36:09,797 --> 00:36:14,992
I was lying there awake and completely paralyzed

454
00:36:15,058 --> 00:36:20,266
while you two excised a wider margin of tissue.

455
00:36:20,583 --> 00:36:22,345
Does that sound familiar?

456
00:36:23,742 --> 00:36:26,746
It felt like you were tearing my face apart.

457
00:36:29,831 --> 00:36:33,537
We'll check the stats with our anesthesiologist, confer with our lawyer, and get back to you.

458
00:36:33,549 --> 00:36:35,518
This isn't going away because you want it to, doctor.

459
00:36:35,530 --> 00:36:36,675
You will be held accountable.

460
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:38,258
And what about your client?

461
00:36:38,376 --> 00:36:41,319
Braying to the media about wounds she inflicted on herself,

462
00:36:41,376 --> 00:36:43,310
mocking the pain of the real victims.

463
00:36:43,387 --> 00:36:45,993
I was a victim here. I felt my surgery.

464
00:36:46,026 --> 00:36:47,981
To do what you've done, you couldn't feel anything.

465
00:36:48,047 --> 00:36:49,296
- Christian. Chris--
- I felt it.

466
00:36:49,367 --> 00:36:53,772
The only thing you feel is the glare of the limelight you think will validate your own existence!

467
00:36:53,803 --> 00:36:57,149
You said I used a grapefruit knife, but I didn't! I used a bread knife.

468
00:36:57,187 --> 00:37:00,560
And that pain was nothing compared to how I felt on your table.

469
00:37:09,285 --> 00:37:11,313
I couldn't take it anymore.

470
00:37:12,496 --> 00:37:14,855
Being invisible, like a ghost.

471
00:37:14,909 --> 00:37:17,873
I couldn't stand walking into a bar

472
00:37:17,909 --> 00:37:20,773
one more time and sitting down and having no one  look at me.

473
00:37:20,871 --> 00:37:25,797
It's not like they think I'm ugly. It's like I'm just not there.

474
00:37:26,334 --> 00:37:29,191
That's what really hurts more than anything.

475
00:37:30,676 --> 00:37:35,412
So, yeah. Cutting my face did hurt...

476
00:37:37,512 --> 00:37:42,990
but it also felt so good later, on this other level.

477
00:37:43,077 --> 00:37:47,020
People were so unbelievably kind to me when they thought I was a carver victim.

478
00:37:47,562 --> 00:37:49,303
Except for you.

479
00:37:49,615 --> 00:37:52,688
Why would you want to make me suffer like that?

480
00:38:17,864 --> 00:38:20,135
We'll walk over together.

481
00:38:20,305 --> 00:38:24,477
And if things go as we hope, I will disappear.

482
00:38:26,858 --> 00:38:28,179
The hair's not too much?

483
00:38:28,211 --> 00:38:31,036
Ellie, you look beautiful.

484
00:38:31,107 --> 00:38:33,336
Inside and out.

485
00:39:01,899 --> 00:39:02,919
Hello, Carl.

486
00:39:11,787 --> 00:39:12,754
Hello.

487
00:39:15,504 --> 00:39:16,917
You're very pretty.

488
00:39:22,291 --> 00:39:23,609
Do I know you?

489
00:39:25,744 --> 00:39:27,654
My memory's not very good.

490
00:39:29,837 --> 00:39:31,314
What's your name again?

491
00:39:35,005 --> 00:39:36,265
I'm Ellie.

492
00:39:39,779 --> 00:39:40,848
Ellie?

493
00:39:56,627 --> 00:40:00,283
This is my girlfriend, Trudy.

494
00:40:12,966 --> 00:40:15,122
Pleased to meet you, Trudy.

495
00:40:15,332 --> 00:40:16,260
Hello.

496
00:40:29,232 --> 00:40:31,419
If it would be any comfort at all,

497
00:40:32,926 --> 00:40:36,446
I would be truly honored to have dinner with you.

498
00:40:47,635 --> 00:40:48,837
Thank you.

499
00:40:52,451 --> 00:40:54,521
But I'm gonna stay here and...

500
00:40:56,124 --> 00:40:59,907
visit with Carl and Trudy.

501
00:41:21,053 --> 00:41:23,362
- Jesus, Matt, you scared the-- 
- I came by to tell you

502
00:41:23,383 --> 00:41:27,529
that I stopped by the courthouse today and rescinded the restraining order.

503
00:41:35,026 --> 00:41:36,353
Thank you, Matt.

504
00:41:40,913 --> 00:41:42,623
You made the right decision.

505
00:41:45,875 --> 00:41:47,913
You won't be sorry, I promise you.

506
00:41:50,309 --> 00:41:51,354
A toast...

507
00:41:57,067 --> 00:41:58,230
to detente?

508
00:42:00,113 --> 00:42:01,695
I did it for mom.

509
00:42:02,951 --> 00:42:04,285
You and me...

510
00:42:07,068 --> 00:42:09,228
we're pretty much done.

511
00:42:19,873 --> 00:42:21,280
Come back here, Matt.

512
00:42:24,618 --> 00:42:25,622
Why?

513
00:42:27,967 --> 00:42:29,733
So you can hit me again?

514
00:42:30,491 --> 00:42:31,326
No.

515
00:42:38,668 --> 00:42:39,759
You hit me.

516
00:42:42,351 --> 00:42:47,807
Come on. Come back here and give me your best shot.

517
00:42:48,579 --> 00:42:50,029
Pain for pain.

518
00:42:51,853 --> 00:42:53,517
Then we'll be even.

519
00:42:54,936 --> 00:42:56,072
Come on.

520
00:42:56,895 --> 00:42:58,136
Hit me.

521
00:43:08,714 --> 00:43:10,126
I'm begging you.

522
00:43:14,571 --> 00:43:16,296
You're very sad.

523
00:43:45,701 --> 00:43:47,395
I thought I might find you here.

524
00:43:49,002 --> 00:43:52,561
The bottle of diprivan I used on Rhea reynolds has disappeared

525
00:43:52,654 --> 00:43:55,228
into the greater dade county sanitation system,

526
00:43:55,296 --> 00:43:59,116
but I am sending the batch that it's from to the lab for analysis.

527
00:43:59,197 --> 00:44:00,440
We'll figure it out, Liz.

528
00:44:00,549 --> 00:44:02,985
Before or after she goes to the media,

529
00:44:03,057 --> 00:44:07,367
and my mistake bankrupts what you and Sean have spent a lifetime building?

530
00:44:09,835 --> 00:44:13,997
I want you to suspend me until the lab tests come back.

531
00:44:14,392 --> 00:44:15,269
Why?

532
00:44:15,341 --> 00:44:18,550
Because then at least it appears we're taking some action.

533
00:44:18,619 --> 00:44:22,026
It gives the appearance of a responsible internal investigation,

534
00:44:22,093 --> 00:44:24,720
which is what we need to do, Christian.

535
00:44:25,997 --> 00:44:28,376
You want to help both of us?

536
00:44:29,630 --> 00:44:31,136
Test it on me.

537
00:44:31,622 --> 00:44:36,819
If anybody knows what it's like to be paralyzed and still have feelings, it's me.

538
00:44:38,284 --> 00:44:40,004
I can't do that, Christian.

539
00:44:40,096 --> 00:44:41,278
Yes, you can.

540
00:44:44,212 --> 00:44:46,681
I could use a few moments of oblivion.

541
00:45:24,625 --> 00:45:26,929
Count backwards from 10 for me.

542
00:46:15,098 --> 00:46:18,335
7...6...

543
00:46:20,705 --> 00:46:21,719
5...

544
00:46:24,688 --> 00:46:25,631
4--

545
00:46:58,142 --> 00:47:00,252
You've made a mess, Rhea.

546
00:47:01,368 --> 00:47:04,947
That's all right. Don't worry.

547
00:47:05,005 --> 00:47:08,328
'Cause I'm gonna give you what you've been wanting all along.

548
00:47:08,495 --> 00:47:09,879
Real pain.

549
00:47:16,474 --> 00:47:18,498
