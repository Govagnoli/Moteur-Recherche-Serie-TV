1
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:02,189
Previously on Nip / Tuck...

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:04,475
So, you'd like
some liposuction, Mrs. Budge.

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:06,630
Whatever it costs, I can afford it.

4
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:08,358
Name your price, sexy man.

5
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:10,670
- You got any mac 'n' cheese?
- Zip it, Dawn.

6
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:12,239
What's the matter with me?

7
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:14,276
Your kidney's been surgically removed.

8
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:17,830
This is a hot car, Matt,
but not as hot as you.

9
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:20,278
Burt can't find out about this.

10
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:22,112
- I smelled it on you, honey.
- Burt.

11
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:24,316
I will ruin you both
before I give my blessing

12
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:27,039
so you can run away
and play happy ever after.

13
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:36,079
Where do you find these people, Sean?

14
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,469
Is there some kind of craigslist
for the ugly and unemployed?

15
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:41,836
Our contract with the Landaus allows
us four pro-bonos every month.

16
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:43,797
I plan on meeting that quota.

17
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:46,111
Free surgeries are like sex
without an orgasm.

18
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:48,350
Unless of course
the patient's name is Blu Mondae,

19
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:51,193
in which case the free surgery
follows an orgasm.

20
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:54,394
- Is it hot in here?
- No.

21
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:55,829
You all right?

22
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:01,439
I had strep throat a couple of weeks ago.
I guess I haven't kicked it.

23
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:06,994
We've had a great run, Christian.
It's time to give back.

24
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:09,992
I do give back as much as
my accountant says I have to.

25
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:13,755
Charity isn't an issue of accounting,
it's an issue of conscience.

26
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,034
Am I right?

27
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:20,708
Go back to work.

28
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:23,633
It's ridiculous. I have a garden-variety
case of strep throat.

29
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:26,314
Doctors, can Dr. Cruz and I
have some privacy?

30
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:31,194
No, it's okay. It's okay. They can stay.

31
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:36,632
You've developed
acute glomerulonephritis.

32
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,551
It's not uncommon after a bout of strep.

33
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,959
What's her filtration rate?

34
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:41,792
She only has about 10 percent left.

35
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:45,270
She's going to need a new kidney
to replace her remaining one.

36
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:51,595
I'm going to recommend
that you begin dialysis immediately.

37
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:55,070
Dialysis takes six hours a day.
How am I supposed to work?

38
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:58,392
I've taken the liberty of placing you
on the national donor list.

39
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:01,916
You are officially 62,342nd in line.

40
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,197
That list is bullshit.
People wait years for one of those organs.

41
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,955
Do you have any family that might be
willing to volunteer as a donor?

42
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:11,190
My only living relative is my mother.

43
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:15,068
And when my father died last year,
she banned me from the funeral.

44
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,430
As far as she's concerned,
my being gay is what killed him.

45
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:21,433
So I don't think that she's gonna be
offering up a kidney any time soon.

46
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:25,472
Sean and I will get tested.

47
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,718
You would do that for me?

48
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:36,553
Jesus, Liz, of course, you're family.
Right, Sean?

49
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,999
Of course.

50
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:36,470
Christian, it's not your face I want to see,
it's hers.

51
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:43,354
- Screw this.
- Christian, wait.

52
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:46,668
- Where do you think you're going?
- I'm done playing dildo.

53
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:48,830
Maybe you're done
playing doctor, Chrissy.

54
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:50,273
You walk out that door

55
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:53,238
and I'm gonna chop that little flesh shop
of yours into fish bait.

56
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:55,470
You can have it and her.

57
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,710
Hopefully one of them
will get you a hard-on.

58
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:00,234
You're done playing with my 10-inch dick.

59
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,114
Christian!

60
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:09,789
Christian!

61
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:11,993
Don't go.

62
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,676
How can you be with a man
who treats you that way?

63
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:18,193
Why do you stay? For the money?

64
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:22,239
What am I supposed to do?
I lose everything if I leave.

65
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:25,559
I won't go back to that hole
I was in before I met Burt.

66
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:28,313
What hole, hooking?
Doesn't seem like you ever stopped.

67
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,832
- I'm sorry.
- No.

68
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,029
Listen to me.

69
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,197
Come with me. Come with me now.
Come with me.

70
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,316
No, I won't belong to another man.

71
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,920
Burt bought my mother a house.

72
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:48,635
He gave my sisters jobs.
This isn't only about me.

73
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:53,156
We have to be smart, Christian.

74
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:56,473
Please, don't make any waves.

75
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,518
I can get us out of this.

76
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,078
Tell your husband he can fire me.
I'm nobody's whore.

77
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,589
What can we do for you, Dawn? More lipo?

78
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,993
God knows I could use it.

79
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,958
In the past six hours
I have consumed more Freihofer's

80
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:35,395
than a French whore
during the Nazi occupation.

81
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:37,232
Those cookies and the oxycodone

82
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:40,596
are the only thing keeping me
from passing out right here from pain.

83
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:41,669
Pain?

84
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,711
- I was earjacked.
- Carjacked?

85
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,674
Earjacked!

86
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:51,513
Jesus, I got one ear,
I can hear better than you.

87
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:56,710
After Dwight left me for Mallory,

88
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,829
I went on a four-week fast food bender.

89
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,958
Arby's, KFC.

90
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:05,592
I even bought a Popeyes franchise
just for good measure.

91
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,797
Well, after thousands of grams
of saturated fat

92
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,472
failed to mend my broken heart,

93
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,638
I drove on down to Boca.

94
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:19,597
Picked myself up a gorgeous
pair ofhonking earrings.

95
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:23,233
First mistake I made,
wearing them in public.

96
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,799
So, what's it gonna cost me, Doc,
for the new ear?

97
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:02,589
- Well, Mrs. Budge...
- Miss, I'm single now.

98
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,359
Miss Budge.

99
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:07,555
We can rebuild the ear

100
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:11,076
using cartilage and fatty tissue
from other parts of your body.

101
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:13,799
- God knows you got plenty.
- Zip it, pretty boy.

102
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,435
What's option two?

103
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:19,195
We could attach an artificial ear
made out of silicone.

104
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:24,273
What am I, Plastic Man?
I'll look like a mannequin at Lane Bryant.

105
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,157
This ear has to be perfect.

106
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:30,071
Now that I am Oprah rich,
and back on the dating scene,

107
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,958
I plan on nabbing my own Stedman
within one year.

108
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,598
There is one other possibility.

109
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:37,956
It's a fairly new technology
and it won't be cheap.

110
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:40,998
Sweetie, I wipe my ass with $100 bills.

111
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:44,630
All right. Then we'll make an appointment
at the genetics lab.

112
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,439
Genetics lab?

113
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:50,080
That's where they're gonna grow
your new ear.

114
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:55,794
Oh, God.

115
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,830
That's incredible.

116
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,589
Deeper.

117
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:08,992
Oh, that's good.

118
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:18,438
I can't tell the difference between
the knots and the muscles.

119
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:20,875
You're like this mass of sculpted steel.

120
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,918
You're too sweet.

121
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,389
It's Pilates.

122
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:29,998
Can you get my lower back?

123
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:32,589
Yeah.

124
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:38,155
Oh, yeah.

125
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,233
What are you doing?

126
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:50,520
I'm sorry. It's just, you were moaning...

127
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,752
We're friends, Matt.

128
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:55,071
I thought I could trust you.

129
00:08:56,840 --> 00:09:00,196
Look, Kimber, I'm sorry, but I like you.

130
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:03,551
I guess you have that effect
on the men in my family.

131
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:06,791
And you thought that because
I had relationships with your dads

132
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,553
that I was just gonna screw you, too?

133
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,877
I thought you were different
than they were, Matt.

134
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:15,713
Yeah, I am. I'm spiritual.

135
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:18,030
I just spent the last month picking up shit

136
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:20,270
in front of Church buildings
for Christ's sake.

137
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:23,113
Did you do that for your growth
or to impress me?

138
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,469
Okay.

139
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,674
Get out.

140
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,834
I don't feel safe with you here anymore.
Go.

141
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,515
Okay.

142
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,113
You're not a match.

143
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,149
How close was I?

144
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:02,312
You're a five out of six,
that's almost a perfect match.

145
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:08,038
Would you describe yourself
as promiscuous, Doctor?

146
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:11,591
Your blood tested high for an antibody
that only appears in people

147
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:14,035
with an unusually
high number of sexual partners.

148
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:17,351
So I can't give Liz a kidney
because I've had too much sex?

149
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,558
There's irony for you.

150
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:22,959
You're disappointed?

151
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:26,549
I've fixed a number ofnephrectomy scars.

152
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,117
It's almost impossible to regain
muscle definition in the affected areas.

153
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:34,318
There are other possible complications,
incontinence, infection, clotting.

154
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:37,631
You are aware that the results
are strictly confidential?

155
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:40,757
I'm only obligated
to reveal the findings to the donor.

156
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:45,150
Are you saying you'll lie for me?

157
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:48,552
I'm saying
it's my responsibility to test you,

158
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:53,517
but it's your responsibility to inform
any interested parties that you're a match.

159
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:59,038
Mr. Landau is here to see you,
he says it's urgent.

160
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:03,393
- Excuse me.
- Yes.

161
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,719
- Are you a match?
- No.

162
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,028
- You?
- No.

163
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,150
Got any other ideas how we can help her?

164
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,037
Well, you can get medicinal marijuana
and Russian brides

165
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,189
over the Internet these days.

166
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:18,679
I'm sure we can find ourselves a kidney.

167
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:19,909
You have any idea what this

168
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,560
come-to-Jesus meeting
with Burt is all about?

169
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,798
Yeah. We're gonna get fired.

170
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:27,154
He found out about Michelle and I.

171
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:29,674
And he said
if we didn't screw in front of him,

172
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,796
then he would tear the business apart.

173
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:34,553
Turns out the old bird is a kinky bastard.

174
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,153
Jesus, Christian.

175
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,708
I should have known if anything
was gonna bring this place to its knees,

176
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,358
it would be your dick.

177
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,678
Think you can get us out of this?

178
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:46,718
Not unless you've got a 12 gauge
and a bunch of hams.

179
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,158
It happened two nights ago.

180
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:57,708
The doctors said
it was an ischemic stroke.

181
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,918
Were you straining? A bowel movement?

182
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,718
We were having sex.

183
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,432
We made it to the hospital
within a half an hour.

184
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:12,080
They told us the clot had dissipated.

185
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:20,837
I'm sorry, but if the clot is fully dissolved

186
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:23,832
and he's already on anticoagulants,
what do you want us to do?

187
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:27,515
You're my plastic surgeons,

188
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:32,833
fix my goddamn face.

189
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,759
Where is Dr. Troy?
This is totally unacceptable.

190
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,956
He's caring for a sick associate.

191
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:52,153
No need to lie.

192
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:55,710
The man is terrified of
our sexual chemistry. I get it.

193
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,753
Here he is.

194
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:04,077
Isn't he beautiful?

195
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,719
We call him Vincent.

196
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,434
After the nineteenth-century painter,
Vincent van Gogh.

197
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:20,638
- He's infamous for cutting off his ear.
- Thanks, Sister Wendy.

198
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,317
I just bought one of his paintings,
I got it hanging in my bathroom.

199
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:26,960
Every time I take a dump now,
I feel artistic.

200
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:30,592
So, Doc, what did you do,
shave the poor thing down?

201
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,758
It's a nude mouse.

202
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:37,316
It's genetically altered
to be born without a thymus gland.

203
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:41,279
It has limited T cells,
which means it can't fight off infections.

204
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:44,557
It also means he's less likely
to reject donated tissue.

205
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,876
Does it hurt when
you sew that thing on to him?

206
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:53,353
No. We implant a tiny, ear-shaped scaffold

207
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,908
filled with donor tissue
into our guy's back.

208
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,197
His blood nourishes the growing cells

209
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:02,113
and in about six weeks, you have an ear.

210
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:04,999
I forwarded Dr. Capler your blood work.

211
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:07,640
So he picked this mouse
based on the results.

212
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:11,834
You'll also be given a heavy dose of
anti-rejection drugs to aid the process.

213
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,319
Even then, there's still
a 20-percent chance

214
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:15,675
that your body will reject the tissue.

215
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,552
Fine, wrap it up.

216
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:20,473
And let me tell you,
the cage better be included in the price.

217
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,357
You can't take the mouse with you.

218
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,476
I used to raise ferrets
in the back of my trailer.

219
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:26,357
I know how to care for a rodent.

220
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:29,238
This mouse has no immune system,

221
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:32,312
so it might not survive outside
of a sterile environment.

222
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:36,070
I'll have Margo come twice a day.
She's my cleaning woman.

223
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:39,550
Doesn't speak a word of English,
but let me tell you, she can...

224
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:43,154
I think maybe you should
go somewhere else.

225
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:46,757
All right, fine, Vinnie stays.

226
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:50,594
But I need to hold him.
I want to bond with my ear.

227
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,192
Isn't he adorable?

228
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:02,350
I always had a thing for baldies.
Look, look at him.

229
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:04,112
Oh, gosh.

230
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:07,710
Oh, to think what this little guy
is going to go through

231
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:10,189
just so I can wear
a pair of sunglasses again.

232
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:15,070
We like to think that
we're creating life of the noblest form,

233
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:18,197
dedicated solely to making others well.

234
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,231
Just like you, Doc.

235
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,516
Thanks, Vinnie.

236
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,356
He can't hear you through that.

237
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,115
Oh.

238
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:00,558
- Hey, Liz.
- Hey!

239
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:03,074
- These are for you.
- Aw, thank you, honey.

240
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,310
Okay, he's here.

241
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:11,838
You guys gonna tell me now?

242
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:17,594
Which one's going under the knife
so I can get out of here?

243
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:24,192
I'm sorry, Liz.
Neither one of us is a match.

244
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:45,990
Sean and I went to school
with some people

245
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,354
from the American Kidney Foundation.

246
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:50,034
We'll try and get you bumped up the list.

247
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:55,313
So someone else who has been waiting
longer gets screwed over to save me?

248
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:57,839
Oh, no.

249
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:00,949
I wouldn't be able to live with myself.

250
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,711
Look on the bright side,

251
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:08,757
they're going to suck a pound of liquid
out of you every time you come in here.

252
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:11,354
You'll be able to fit into your skinny jeans.

253
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:16,152
Okay, okay. It's enough of me complaining.

254
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:22,192
Distract me. How's the baby, Sean?

255
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:26,472
Good. Bigger. Starting to smile.

256
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:31,275
It's great when they start to give
a little something back, huh?

257
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:41,233
All I'm asking is you bump her up
a couple of notches on the donor list.

258
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:42,548
You owe me, Jim.

259
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:45,029
Who helped you get into the pants
of that hot Brazilian radiologist

260
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,714
with the big fake tits
when we were residents?

261
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:52,631
You married her? No shit.

262
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:55,394
Well, tell her I said hello.

263
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:58,677
Blood work came back on Burt Landau.

264
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:01,320
Guess what he was on
the night of his stroke?

265
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:06,234
Viagra.

266
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:09,555
Excuse me?

267
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:11,870
Your husband was on it
the night that he had a stroke.

268
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,598
You remember that night?

269
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:16,110
"I can get us out of this, Christian. "

270
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:18,156
Are you suggesting that I gave it to him?

271
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,276
I'm suggesting that it's a little odd
for a man to take a drug

272
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:22,954
that every doctor he's seen
over the past two years

273
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:24,359
has said could kill him.

274
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:27,159
How dare you. I am not a murderer.

275
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:30,198
Are you saying through all of this,
the surgeries, you and me,

276
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:31,554
you never wished he was dead?

277
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:36,919
Wishing and actually doing something
about it are two very different things.

278
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,879
I thought you knew me.

279
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:47,271
We'll see if I do.

280
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:54,794
Who gave you the Viagra, Burt?

281
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:59,400
Who gave you the Viagra?

282
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,313
I don't know.

283
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:05,674
Stop covering for her, she tried to kill you.

284
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,431
No, she didn't.

285
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:16,312
I took it myself.

286
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:20,949
Stupid.

287
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:26,398
But those three minutes inside her

288
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:34,037
was worth giving up
how many years I got left.

289
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,639
- Wait. I'm sorry.
- Stay away from me.

290
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:50,474
If I didn't need you to fix
my husband's face you'd be fired already.

291
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:54,472
From now on,
consider us business associates.

292
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:05,473
What do you want?

293
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:09,116
I want a personality test.

294
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,519
Go away, Christian.

295
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:14,115
Come on, Kimmy. It's me.
You know, the guy you almost married.

296
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:18,030
Let me in. I need to talk to you.

297
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:32,153
Jesus, you smell like a brewery.

298
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:36,597
And you smell like happy memories.

299
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:42,069
You know, every time I get close to
a woman who's wearing your perfume,

300
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:43,798
I get a hard-on?

301
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:47,429
Okay.

302
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:50,670
Now I know where he gets it from.

303
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:56,917
Your son came on to me the other day.

304
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:58,229
Oh.

305
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:02,116
So congratulations,
you don't need to force me

306
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,838
not to see him anymore.

307
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:07,558
Your genes and bad influence
have done it for you.

308
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:17,630
- Can I get myself a Scotch, sweetie pie?
- One drink and then you hit the road.

309
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:21,477
I'm sorry about Mattie.

310
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:24,831
- I'll talk to him.
- No, don't.

311
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,758
He's just young.

312
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:31,274
He doesn't understand what it means
to really believe in something yet.

313
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:40,390
This shit really works for you, huh?

314
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:43,117
For once in my life I feel like

315
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:46,035
there's something I can
give myself freely to

316
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:48,190
and I can expect the same in return.

317
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:08,630
I never gave to you like that?

318
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:11,436
When you wanted to,

319
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,116
but it always came with a price.

320
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,791
Maybe you should audit me.

321
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:29,471
If it works for you,
there must be something to it, right?

322
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,992
Christian, stop.

323
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:03,192
Don't tell me you never think
about me, baby.

324
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,875
When you're alone in bed at night

325
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:17,476
and your fingers find their way down
to your pretty little rosebud.

326
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:25,669
You never close your eyes
and pretend those hands are mine?

327
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:29,116
Oh, please stop, Christian. Please. Stop.

328
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:21,632
Let's lock ourselves in and make love and

329
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:25,588
eat take-out for a few days.

330
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:29,117
I need to go.

331
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:31,669
Okay.

332
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:36,354
I have a seminar at Church
tomorrow afternoon

333
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:39,159
if you want to come by
and I'll audit you then.

334
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:47,553
Are you kidding me?

335
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:51,913
I don't give a shit about your
whackado religion.

336
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:56,390
What? You told me you wanted to...

337
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:58,152
I said what I always say,

338
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:01,399
whatever it takes to get me laid.

339
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:10,274
How can you be so cruel?

340
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:16,994
Why didn't you just go screw one of your
whores if you needed to get laid?

341
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:20,317
Whores only give you their body.

342
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:25,073
I needed to feel like
the most important man in the world,

343
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:27,958
and you're the only person
who can do that for me.

344
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:34,198
Don't worry, sweetheart,

345
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:37,917
I'm sure there's some chapter in Dianetics
that will help you get through...

346
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,230
Get out! Get out!

347
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:43,518
I hate you! Get out of my house.

348
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:56,478
Oh, my God!

349
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:11,474
Oh, yes.

350
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:13,789
I know.

351
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,029
Hey.

352
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:20,832
I didn't know you were
coming over tonight.

353
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:22,876
I invited her. I reckoned that even gals

354
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:25,838
on a restricted diet
deserved a home-cooked meal.

355
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,675
Listen, you have no idea
what this means to me,

356
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,798
but I cannot accept it.

357
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:36,839
Accept what?

358
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:40,593
When I found out that you
couldn't be a donor for Liz,

359
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:43,752
I called and asked for permission
to be tested.

360
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:47,119
You're a match?

361
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:50,993
No, but I am.

362
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:56,070
I swear I didn't know
he was getting tested, Sean.

363
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:00,351
Liz is family, Dad.
She used to baby-sit me.

364
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:04,832
She even let me have a swig of beer
at one of her barbecues when I was 14.

365
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:08,510
You are my hero,

366
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:12,635
but I will not let you do this for me.

367
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:18,075
The acorn didn't fall far from the tree,
did it, Daddy?

368
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:30,598
Do you have any idea how life-altering
a kidney donation can be?

369
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:32,591
I've just recently been forced
to come to the conclusion

370
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:35,353
that I've spent my entire life taking,
so unless you can come up with

371
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:38,591
a good reason why I shouldn't,
I'm going through with it.

372
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:43,110
- How could you let him do this?
- Oh, she didn't let me do anything.

373
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,509
- I'm 18.
- I didn't think he'd be a match,

374
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:47,318
you and Christian weren't.

375
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:49,438
I mean, I don't want him to do it either,

376
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:52,114
but, you know,
he doesn't need our consent.

377
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,272
I haven't seen you in a month, Matt.

378
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:58,839
Well, that's going to change.

379
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:01,673
Where do you think
I'll be doing my convalescing?

380
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:06,118
You guys raised me to
take care of people, yeah?

381
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:10,275
I know I haven't always lived up
to that, but I want to start now.

382
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:19,433
What's going to happen when
you take the ear off him?

383
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:24,228
We're sending him off to live on a ranch
in Wyoming with his other donor buddies.

384
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:28,074
Seriously, if I built him a sterile room
at Tara Budge

385
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:29,992
do you think I could keep him?

386
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:33,152
The only room you're going to need
to build for him is a mausoleum.

387
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:35,356
The mice don't survive the surgery.

388
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:36,754
Seriously?

389
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,951
We could cancel the procedure.

390
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:46,073
Nah, do it.

391
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:49,392
I'm going to need both ears
to pull off my fall wardrobe.

392
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:40,358
You all right there, partner?

393
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:46,514
Matt wants to give Liz his kidney.

394
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:49,398
He and Julia got tested.

395
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:54,278
The kid's got balls.
I'll kill him before I let him do it,

396
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:56,920
but you've got to admit the kid's got balls.

397
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:04,311
He must have got them from you.

398
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:06,596
He certainly didn't get my kidneys.

399
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,878
I lied. I'm a match for Liz.

400
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:17,597
A five of six.

401
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:26,829
What?

402
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:29,870
Look, I have a handicapped son
I have to operate on.

403
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:31,598
I can't be out of commission
for three months.

404
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:34,831
Bullshit. Give her the kidney after
you operate on Conor's hands.

405
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:36,717
You're shit-scared about going
under the knife, that's all.

406
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:38,233
That's not the point right now.

407
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:41,790
Our goal needs to be to stop Matt
from forcing the issue with Liz.

408
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:43,916
Well, I can think of a way of stopping him.

409
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,991
Give Liz somebody else's kidney.

410
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:09,674
Coming!

411
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:17,712
Hey, you're early. Come on in.

412
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:20,513
Thanks for inviting me.

413
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:24,559
After what happened I didn't think
you'd really want to see me.

414
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:28,035
I thought a lot about it and

415
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:29,758
realized I was totally out of line.

416
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:32,718
And I wanted you to come over
so I could apologize.

417
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:37,756
- Make you a drink?
- No, thanks. I'm off the booze.

418
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:41,917
- You training for something?
- No, it's just that...

419
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,471
Well, you know
my dads' anesthesiologist, Liz?

420
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:46,630
She needs a kidney
and I'm going to give her mine.

421
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:49,837
So I have to be totally clean
to make sure her body doesn't reject it.

422
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:50,909
Wow.

423
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:53,755
That's awfully generous of you.

424
00:31:56,640 --> 00:32:00,792
Yeah, well, I really took what you said
to me to heart, you know?

425
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:03,193
About giving back.

426
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:12,637
You really are a beautiful soul,
Matthew McNamara.

427
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,755
So, where are your kidneys, anyways?

428
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:21,359
Back here.

429
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:23,435
Here?

430
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:26,671
Do you think it's going to hurt?

431
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:30,074
Well, it's not going to feel good.

432
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:39,832
- Does that feel good?
- Yeah.

433
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:14,270
I assume you know I'll be overseeing
my husband's surgery in the OR.

434
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:18,035
Of course. I know how you and
your husband like to watch each other.

435
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:51,794
- Is there something wrong?
- His blood pressure's dropping.

436
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:53,552
Give me one milligram ANP.

437
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:02,714
He's gone into V-fib,
give me the crash cart.

438
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:31,837
Clear. Clear.

439
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:37,198
Blood pressure's coming back,
heart rate stabilizing.

440
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:03,712
- It looks good. What happened?
- Earjacked. You?

441
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:06,192
Someone stole my kidney.

442
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,389
I didn't know they did
real medical stuff in here, too.

443
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:13,833
No, they don't.

444
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:18,918
Sean and Christian set that up for me
so I could work a couple of hours a day.

445
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:20,515
Wow.

446
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:23,759
That is really nice of them
to do that for you.

447
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:26,075
I mean, come on, you think about it,
the last thing some socialite

448
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:28,037
wants to see after her eye job

449
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:30,509
is somebody having
a blood-scrubbing, right?

450
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:35,715
How'd you do it? You know,
get them to care about you so much?

451
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:39,277
I'm sure you have people in your life
that would do the same for you.

452
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:41,396
Yeah, I got plenty of people.

453
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:44,759
Most of them showed up
right when the money did.

454
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:56,276
- You expecting someone?
- Not really.

455
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:01,311
I thought maybe my ex
and my daughter might stop by but...

456
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:03,911
They're back in Pensacola now so...

457
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,399
Maybe they don't know
what happened to you.

458
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:08,358
Bullshit.
I did an exclusive two-parter on Montel.

459
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:10,396
They never ever miss an episode.

460
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:19,512
You know how much money I've spent
since I won that Powerball?

461
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:22,153
Twenty million.

462
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:24,596
Yeah, I got a huge house.

463
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:27,475
I got more ice than an Eskimo.

464
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:29,949
I got a racehorse I've never even seen.

465
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:31,673
And you know what?

466
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:34,593
I'd give twice that right now to have
somebody walk through that door

467
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:36,557
just to hold my hand.

468
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:43,752
I used to raise ferrets, you know,
before the money.

469
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:46,158
There was this one,

470
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:50,036
Knickers, cutest thing
I ever saw in my life,

471
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:52,998
she got her little paw
caught in the trailer door.

472
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:59,392
I hocked my entire Franklin Mint
collection on eBay just to pay her vet bills.

473
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:04,592
You know, I nursed her.
She got better. I loved her, you know.

474
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:07,795
I could tell she loved me, too.

475
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:09,279
And look at me now.

476
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:12,751
You know how I got this ear?

477
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:16,277
I killed a mouse for it. Vincent.

478
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:18,838
Cute little guy, too.

479
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:22,159
He grew the ear on his back, you know,
and I let him sacrifice himself

480
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:25,038
just so I could look good
in my Jill St. Johns.

481
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:27,470
I'm sure Vincent understood.

482
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:30,353
The point is,
I gave more when I had nothing.

483
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:34,231
It's like I traded my soul
for all that money, you know.

484
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:38,389
And then I look at you, I mean,
the victim of a horrible crime,

485
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:40,153
and what gets you through?

486
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:44,552
The hope that maybe for a couple of hours
a day you get to be a doctor.

487
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:47,836
You're a hero. You are.

488
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:50,876
I'm a big fat zero.

489
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:55,272
God, what happened to me?

490
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:11,470
Too bad they can't grow a kidney
on the back of a mouse, huh?

491
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:24,868
This isn't right.

492
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:28,157
He should be in a facility
that can care for him properly.

493
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:30,433
He needs to be home.

494
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:33,916
This isn't like recovery
from his other surgeries.

495
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,672
He's had a massive stroke.

496
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:38,115
Which means diaper changes
and intense physical therapy.

497
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:39,428
It could be years before
he's back on his feet.

498
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:42,557
I've hired a hospice nurse
to be here at night.

499
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:47,516
And I'm perfectly capable
of handling things during the day.

500
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:49,033
What about work?

501
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:52,390
I'll take a leave of absence.

502
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:58,238
You don't need to do that.

503
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:02,759
This is a list of the top
inpatient rehab clinics in Miami.

504
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:04,273
- Do you and Burt a favor...
- No.

505
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:06,920
- ... and at least go look at them.
- I won't...

506
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,831
I won't put him in a nursing home.

507
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:11,070
Of course, you wouldn't want to
do anything to piss him off

508
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:13,958
enough to make him change his will.

509
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:16,230
You think I want it like this?

510
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:21,750
You think I want to spend the rest of
my youth holed up in this tomb?

511
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:26,873
But he's still my husband, he needs me.

512
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:29,713
But you don't love him anymore.
You love me.

513
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:37,434
You wanted me to let him die
on that table, I saw it in your eyes.

514
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:43,152
And I saw it in yours,
but you saved him anyway.

515
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:45,758
Now it's my turn.

516
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:35,114
Hey, Sean.

517
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:41,108
- We need to talk.
- About Matt, I know.

518
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:44,275
He's adamant about giving me his kidney.

519
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:48,353
I'm afraid he's going to leave it on
my doorstep in a gift-wrapped cooler.

520
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:50,592
You don't need Matt's kidney.

521
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:54,676
Because I'm going to give you mine.

522
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:57,749
That is very sweet, Sean,

523
00:40:57,840 --> 00:41:02,038
but I think that we're both gonna feel
a little silly when my body rejects it.

524
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:03,394
It won't.

525
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,355
I'm a five of six match for you.

526
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:12,318
I lied about my test results.

527
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:15,238
I'm sorry, Liz.

528
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:20,989
I was scared, of the surgery, the recovery.

529
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:24,952
- I just...
- Didn't want to end up like me.

530
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:35,838
Why the change of heart?

531
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:39,035
I would never have known that you lied.

532
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:46,552
I made a list of the people
I thought would give me a kidney.

533
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:48,392
It was pretty short.

534
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:52,197
Then I made a list of

535
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:56,000
people I'd give one to, it was even shorter.

536
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:04,512
I always thought of myself as
a good friend, someone you can count on.

537
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:09,989
It wasn't until all of this happened
that I realized that I was full of shit.

538
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:16,988
What I'm saying, Liz... I love you.
I don't want to lose you.

539
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:23,115
You're going to take my kidney.

540
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:25,668
I've scheduled the operation for tomorrow.

541
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:31,068
Shit. Scary, huh?

542
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:34,990
I have never asked you
to do this for me, Sean.

543
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:40,916
You shouldn't have had to.

544
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:46,029
The truth is, I can't.

545
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:49,749
Frankly, your kidney's not hot enough.

546
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:54,277
You're only a five of six.
I have found a better match.

547
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:57,752
A better match? Who?

548
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:02,188
A perfect six-out-of-six,
just like my Powerball ticket.

549
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:04,675
I guess lightning really can strike twice.

550
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:07,110
Especially when it has such a large target.

551
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:08,599
That target didn't seem to bother you

552
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:12,468
when you were pinning me to
your apartment floor, sweet cheeks.

553
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:16,959
Should we begin?

554
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:18,708
I'm ready when you are.

555
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:21,951
Go gentle, Doc.
I got to look my best for bikini season.

556
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:24,310
Dr. Muthara is going to be doing
most of the heavy lifting,

557
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:26,914
but we'll do what we can
to minimize the scarring.

558
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:28,911
Though I have to warn you, Miss Budge,

559
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:30,956
there's very little we can do
with a nephrectomy scar

560
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:33,918
because of the angle
at which the incision is made.

561
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:37,197
Screw it, it'll be my badge of honor.

562
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:43,432
You think I can come by every
now and then and visit my kidney?

563
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:47,433
- You know, for coffee or something?
- I don't think I can say no.

564
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:50,513
- How's next Thursday?
- Okay.

565
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:53,110
Looks like you got a friend
for life there, Lizzy.

566
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:54,838
You sure it's worth it?

567
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:02,117
- How we doing?
- Scared.

568
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:05,148
Relax, you're among friends.

569
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:10,152
- Thank you.
- My privilege.

570
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:13,834
Okay, count back from ten for me.

571
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,149
Ten,

572
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:18,714
nine,

573
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:22,835
eight, seven...

574
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:03,315
