1
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:02,959
Previously on Nip / Tuck...

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:04,393
Something wrong with our baby?

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:08,359
- It's called Electridl...
- Ectrodactyly.

4
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:10,915
Look, you're a doctor.
You know what those hands look like.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,319
Never be able to go out in public

6
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:15,756
and not be stared at by strangers
who'd laugh that he's a freak!

7
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:17,990
- Where's Mattie?
- He's in the garage.

8
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:20,275
- It's been over two hours.
- Sweetheart, just let him be.

9
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:23,113
It's a family dinner, Julia.
That means all the family.

10
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:26,112
Maybe the reason your relationships
with women keep failing

11
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:27,189
is because you're taken.

12
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:28,395
What the hell are you talking about?

13
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:31,517
Have you ever considered the possibility
that you're in love with your partner?

14
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:46,192
Nothing like the real thing, baby.

15
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:49,750
Everything's real about me
except my name, Blu Mondae.

16
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:54,356
I made it up when I moved out here
from Embarrass, Minnesota,

17
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:57,398
that's the coldest place
in the United States.

18
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,310
I nearly froze my hooters off.
Wanna know my real name?

19
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:02,833
Honey,
everything I need to know about you

20
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:04,751
is bouncing right in front of my face.

21
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:08,789
You can have them.
They're like huge weights around my neck.

22
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:09,915
By the end of the day...

23
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,797
Sweetheart, I pay you money
to keep it simple,

24
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:16,351
which means more ass and less mouth,
unless it's sucking on me hard.

25
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:17,909
Sorry.

26
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:24,997
Look, your breasts are beautiful.

27
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:28,277
They're the quintessence of femininity.
Trust me, I should know.

28
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:32,114
I spend my life stuffing implants
into flat-chested wannabes.

29
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:34,512
You're a plastic surgeon?

30
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:36,148
I can't get taken serious

31
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:39,471
on account of everyone assumes
I'm just some big-titted whore.

32
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:43,155
I couldn't even get a job at Sea World
because my tits weren't "family friendly. "

33
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:44,719
Why would you wanna look like a boy?

34
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,233
Well, if you made them look smaller,

35
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,515
then people's attitudes
towards me would change.

36
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:51,910
I could maybe go into business
selling Mary Kay or something.

37
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,276
I could work it off.

38
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,633
Sorry, honey. You could dance
on my dick until you're 90.

39
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:02,996
No pro bono for boning a pro,
no matter how hot you are.

40
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:04,195
New policy.

41
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:05,919
Let's go.

42
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:11,035
Shit!

43
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:14,998
Thank you, sweetheart.

44
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:17,309
Yeah?

45
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:20,153
Shit, Michelle,
I'm in the middle of something.

46
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,471
I'll be there when I'm finished.

47
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:27,754
Yeah. Let's get them bouncing, honey.

48
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,474
That's it.

49
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:37,192
Mr. Skinner, tell me
what you don't like about yourself.

50
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:40,838
- Well, I was...
- His chin, for starters.

51
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:45,436
It's weak and a bit ill-defined.
We're thinking something stronger.

52
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,719
And maybe a little straightening
of the nose.

53
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,349
Something a bit more aristocratic,
like, well, like this.

54
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:57,679
So you'd like me to make him look
more like you?

55
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,798
Well, I'm not expecting miracles.

56
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:02,440
We can't all be born
with these cheekbones.

57
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,792
I was a sculptor's model.

58
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:08,915
You remember the naked statue
that caused such a fuss in Tampa?

59
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,594
- The dolphin?
- Oh, snap!

60
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,073
I like you.

61
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,278
Brains and beauty.

62
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:22,996
I'm sorry. I don't play for your team.

63
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:26,510
That's what they all say at first.

64
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:30,316
Look at Mitchell.
Straight as the day was long.

65
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,753
Until I came along and saved him

66
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:35,833
from a backwards,
backwoods marriage to a child-bride.

67
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:41,032
- You were married?
- I was 16.

68
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:44,238
We grew up together. It didn't work out.

69
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:46,470
You see? People can change.

70
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:53,471
He was so innocent, poor boy.

71
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:57,109
But I thought,
"I can make something of this boy. "

72
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,238
But the face...

73
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:04,192
Mr. Skinner, is this something
you're interested in?

74
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,477
Yeah. Sure. You know.

75
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:11,030
Mitchell understands
that the world I live in,

76
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,395
that we live in, has a certain aesthetic.

77
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:18,600
And you can't enjoy its privileges without
conforming to certain higher standards.

78
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:30,274
Why don't we schedule you for a
pre-operative consultation, Mr. Skinner?

79
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:33,989
That way we can go through your options
in greater detail?

80
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,598
How's that sound?

81
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:38,673
Hey. We got you a little something,
sort of a pre-birthday present.

82
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,037
- It's a gym membership.
- It's the new one down on Collins.

83
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:50,476
Oh, well, thanks. That's really cool of you.

84
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:53,274
But, I got everything I need in the garage.

85
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,354
Matt, wait.

86
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:00,429
It's just that we think
you're in there all the time.

87
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:03,269
- You're all alone.
- Yeah, I like being alone.

88
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,271
But it'd be good for you to get out, honey.

89
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,351
You know, just to be around other people.

90
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:10,876
It's two minutes from your therapist's,
you can go right after.

91
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:13,355
Was there anything else
you wanna control in my life?

92
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,078
Maybe I should be
on a bathroom schedule, too?

93
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:18,755
Look, do us a favor.
Don't say no until you check it out.

94
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,109
Morning.

95
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:32,397
You know, it could've been worse, Sean.
You know, at least it didn't blow up.

96
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:36,476
Is there any raspberry jelly?

97
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,991
What did you do to your hands?

98
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:46,115
Nothing. I just taped them up
to look like the baby's gonna look.

99
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,993
Untape them, please. Right now.

100
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:52,117
I just wanted to see
what it would be like to eat and stuff.

101
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,792
Put the glass down and take off that tape.

102
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:56,269
- Sean...
- Look, just give me your hands.

103
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,874
- Oh!
- Shit!

104
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:01,032
I'm sorry. I was just curious
what it would be like for him.

105
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,951
You don't imitate
another person's disabilities.

106
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:05,190
It's like you're making fun of them.

107
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:14,834
Look, just get ready for school
and I'll drive you, okay?

108
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,158
You overreacted, Sean.

109
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,310
Now, we only told her about the baby
a week ago.

110
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,789
If she has questions, she can ask us.
We'll get her a book.

111
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:29,269
A book's not gonna tell her how to feel.

112
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,431
Tell her I'll be in the car.

113
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:44,239
Double latte, Sean?

114
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,954
- Boo.
- Sorry.

115
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:00,110
Which do you think is ruder?
You staring at my face,

116
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,553
or me telling you
to move your ass out of the way

117
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:04,279
because you're staring at my face and
blocking customers?

118
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,716
Non-fat vanilla mocha for Elaine?

119
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,759
Excuse me.

120
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,395
Look, I apologize.

121
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:20,439
It's just, I'm a plastic surgeon and
you have Treacher Collins.

122
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:24,472
I do? Oh, my God!

123
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:27,074
I haven't seen a case since medical school.

124
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:31,317
There have been
a lot of technical advances since then.

125
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:36,756
If you're interested, come in for a consult.

126
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:40,472
I think I could help you.

127
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:54,559
Did you know you were gay
when you got married?

128
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,752
I'm not sure I'm gay now.

129
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:00,749
Arthur bought me a Porsche,
and he moved me into his guest house.

130
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:03,798
Buys me clothes,
takes me to all these fancy parties.

131
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:06,914
It's worth the occasional blowjob,
you know?

132
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:18,959
The cheek implants are made of bone
grafted from the back of your skull.

133
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,832
It sounds worse than it is.

134
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:25,998
Fix the droop here by adding
fatty deposits for greater support,

135
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:30,389
and reposition the angle of your jaw,

136
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:35,589
which should have a positive effect
on your breathing, eating, speaking.

137
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:37,712
How about French kissing?

138
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:46,311
Why didn't you have any of this done
when you were younger?

139
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:49,551
My dad was a janitor.
The health coverage sucked.

140
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:52,911
When I was born, I had so many
medical problems he got kicked off it.

141
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,309
I guess it was just something
I learned to live with, you know?

142
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,358
So you're gay for pay?

143
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:03,632
Trust me, killer,
there's plenty of sugar mamas out there

144
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:07,918
who'd love a good-looking guy like you
without demanding surgical alterations.

145
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:11,632
Straight's a hell of a lot easier,
if you have a choice.

146
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,079
You bi, too?

147
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,309
No. I'm not bi.

148
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:21,392
I just hate to see somebody
being trapped into something they're not

149
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:23,710
because of financial hardship.

150
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:28,270
You're gonna do all this for nothing?

151
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:31,200
- Why?
- It all comes out in the wash.

152
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,680
We have an opening this week,
if you're interested.

153
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:37,793
It's funny, you know?

154
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:40,832
What you can get used to.

155
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:48,475
Looking like I do,
it's forced me to accept being different.

156
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,869
It must have been a hard way to grow up.

157
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:58,676
I just always assumed it was too late,
you know?

158
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,673
And when I got the job making coffee,

159
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:04,912
I thought, at least I'm not hiding out
in a basement where no one can see me.

160
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:08,793
You don't need to be making lattes
for the rest of your life.

161
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:12,270
You don't need to do this shit to
satisfy some rich old queen.

162
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:16,999
You should hang with me sometime,
let me reintroduce you to the other side,

163
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:18,833
to who you really are.

164
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:20,433
You wanna hang with me?

165
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:23,114
- Sure.
- Cool.

166
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:27,592
- When?
- How's tomorrow sound?

167
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:49,071
Come on. Get going. Get going.

168
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:55,838
All right, come on, let's go!
All right, hands going. Keep it going!

169
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:58,912
Come on! Keep it going over there!
Work, work, work!

170
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,719
There you go! Come on, keep it going!
Keep it going! Keep it going!

171
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:05,110
Come on! Almost! Almost!
All right, you're done!

172
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,838
Thanks a lot, you guys.

173
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:30,309
Kimber.

174
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:34,995
Matt! Hi, how are you?

175
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:38,152
- Oh, gosh. Sorry, I'm all sweaty.
- Oh, that's all right.

176
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:41,950
- Look at you. You've grown.
- Oh, yeah. I've been working out.

177
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:43,393
Yeah, nice.

178
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:47,389
- Wow. You look wonderful.
- Really? Thank you.

179
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:50,632
Yeah. What...
Have you changed your hair or what?

180
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:55,475
No, the hair's the same.
I'm just, I'm just feeling clearer, I guess.

181
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:58,199
But it's good to know it shows, though.
Thanks.

182
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:01,153
- So, what up?
- Nothing. Wait a minute.

183
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:04,277
So, what have you been doing?
Like Tai Chi? Yoga? What?

184
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,308
Not really.

185
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,794
Well...

186
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,278
You really wanna know?

187
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,794
All I can say is that the tech works.

188
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:23,279
I was a total victim of my reactive mind,
but now I have this awareness...

189
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,954
- So is this like therapy?
- No way!

190
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:30,474
How many people do you know
actually got better from seeing a shrink?

191
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,997
Those people don't listen,

192
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:35,435
they interpret
based on their own hang-ups

193
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:37,909
and then lay their bullshit
onto their patients.

194
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,514
- Stay away from them, Matt.
- Too late.

195
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:43,949
Sorry.

196
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:49,398
- Well, is it working for you?
- I don't feel as bad as I did.

197
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:52,751
But then again,
I don't feel much of anything.

198
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:56,549
- I've been taking these anti-depressants.
- Matt, that's awful.

199
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:57,755
I know.

200
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,990
- Sometimes it's better to be numb than...
- What?

201
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,832
Wait. Why would you say that?

202
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:06,630
This is your life we're talking about here.
You wanna be awake for it, don't you?

203
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:12,792
Matt, come on. Things happened to me,
things that I would rather not remember.

204
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:17,635
But the more I avoided dealing with them
the more I became a prisoner of my past.

205
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:21,315
- So did you find God or something?
- I found my integrity.

206
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:23,153
And my self-worth.

207
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,558
And so can you.

208
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:44,715
Well, maybe this isn't such a great idea.

209
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,756
It's been a while
since I've been with a woman.

210
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:48,159
It's just like riding a bike, my friend.

211
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:52,711
All you gotta do
is get yourself the right hot bitch.

212
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:58,160
- And there she is right now.
- Hey, doc!

213
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:00,397
Wanna dance?

214
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:05,032
Actually, Mitchell here
was interested in meeting you.

215
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,353
Sure. Hi, Mitchell.

216
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:11,030
Can you excuse us a second? Come here.

217
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:13,596
Listen, sweetheart,
the kid's a little confused.

218
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:14,908
He hasn't been with a woman in a while,

219
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,195
and I want you to remind him
of what he's been missing.

220
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:20,078
No problem, I'm big with the bi guys.

221
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:23,069
- I'm very maternal.
- I bet you are.

222
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:26,798
But, this is gonna take
a little more than a lap dance.

223
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:30,316
- I'm not a whore, you know.
- Of course you're not. How much?

224
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:31,909
Forget it.

225
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,632
I'll do your tits for free.

226
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:40,992
All you gotta do
is spend the night with him

227
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:45,392
and make him feel like your
body is the happiest place on Earth.

228
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:48,597
Oh, my God! Thank you! Thank you!
Thank you, you're awesome!

229
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:50,750
- Watch the suit, huh?
- Sorry.

230
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:52,837
You must really want this guy
to be straight.

231
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:55,480
He is straight. He just doesn't know it yet.

232
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,079
Go get him, tiger.

233
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:00,998
- Hi, cutie. Follow me.
- Hi.

234
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,476
Does that feel good, baby?

235
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:20,350
Yeah. Sure.

236
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:25,196
Your thighs are so strong.

237
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,519
Squish.

238
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:37,834
You're starting to feel it, too, huh, baby?

239
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:42,513
Yeah, yeah. I'm getting a woody.

240
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:44,910
You sure are, baby.

241
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:52,756
Okay, now I'm gonna close my eyes
and pretend that you're deep inside me.

242
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:56,077
You do it, too, okay?

243
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,793
Yeah, okay.

244
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:05,593
I'm inside you.

245
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,672
Are you feeling it, baby?

246
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:13,792
Oh, yeah. Oh, mama...

247
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:28,718
- You ready?
- Anything to improve my love life.

248
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,719
My on-line girlfriend's
giving me carpal tunnel.

249
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,711
Count backwards from 10 for me.

250
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:38,910
Ten, nine, eight,

251
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:42,715
seven, six...

252
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:52,559
15-blade.

253
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:35,395
Ruler.

254
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:45,073
Shit.
The mandibular plane angle's too steep.

255
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:48,554
He's expecting Viggo Mortensen's chin.

256
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,471
And he'll get it. 15-blade.

257
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,991
And then don't you, like, grab from the end
and you go through?

258
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,115
Yeah.

259
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:03,635
Perfect.

260
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:05,915
Mommy, do you know where that
really soft yarn is

261
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,115
that I bought with you last weekend?

262
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,349
I wanna show Zoey.

263
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:11,432
Yeah, I think I put it in your closet.
I'll go and get it.

264
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,794
You'll love this stuff. It's really soft.

265
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:47,353
What is this?

266
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:51,917
- We were just playing.
- At your brother's expense?

267
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:57,035
Zoey, can you please go home now?
You can come back another time.

268
00:19:58,040 --> 00:19:59,029
Bye.

269
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:06,191
- Do you think this is funny?
- No.

270
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:08,589
Are you making fun
of what your brother's gonna have?

271
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:10,591
You know, and that's how
you're amusing your friends?

272
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:11,669
No. I was just...

273
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:16,231
Do you have any idea how difficult
this is gonna be for us, huh?

274
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,273
And for him?

275
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:21,909
Throw them all out.

276
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,276
And all the ones in your closet.
Just get them out!

277
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:37,990
This just measures
your emotional responses.

278
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:43,598
When the needle floats, it just means
that you got rid of a bunch of old crap,

279
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:47,593
bad feelings, experiences in your life
that has just gotten in your way.

280
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:53,074
So, are you willing to share with me
some of your difficulties?

281
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:58,831
- Okay, fine. Go ahead.
- Fantastic.

282
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:03,313
So tell me about the decisions
you've made in your life. Right or wrong.

283
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:09,953
Well, gee, let's see.
There was getting involved with Ariel.

284
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:13,874
- That was a real good decision.
- Thank you for that.

285
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:17,269
Any other decisions?
Good, bad, right or wrong.

286
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:20,193
I don't care.
Just tell me what comes to your mind.

287
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:21,315
Okay.

288
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:27,918
When her Aryan Nation
suckwad of a father held a gun to my head

289
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,595
and gave me the choice of cutting off
this guy's dick or my own,

290
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:33,238
I decided that...

291
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,392
I decided on his.

292
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:39,995
Cherry's.

293
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:45,196
She was a pre-op transsexual
and my friend.

294
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:46,669
Okay.

295
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:50,117
- Any other decisions?
- I don't wanna do this.

296
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:54,113
The tech works, Matt.
You just gotta trust it.

297
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:07,074
Fine, you wanna hear
about my best decision ever?

298
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,229
I do.

299
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:16,236
Cherry had a gun
pointed directly at that bastard.

300
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:19,429
She was hesitant, unsure what to do.

301
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:23,433
I should've grabbed it from her,
but instead she shot him in the stomach.

302
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:26,469
And, I left him there to rot.

303
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:32,231
Getting Cherry to the hospital was more
important than the life of that shit-stain.

304
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:37,228
You can write him care of the Florida
state prison system if you like.

305
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,830
This is really, really good, Matt.

306
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:43,152
- Keep going. Any other decisions?
- Don't you get it?

307
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:46,959
I've never made a decision in my life.

308
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:51,438
I mean, I let my dick choose some
pretty girl and I nearly got it cut off.

309
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:54,512
You know? And the whole thing
with Cherry and the shooting...

310
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:57,637
I mean, that was out of my hands.
I never had a choice.

311
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:03,359
- Can you repeat what you just said to me?
- What? That I never had a choice?

312
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,317
I never had a choice.

313
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:21,031
How did I never see that?

314
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:24,918
Well, thank you, Matt.

315
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:30,198
Now, tell me I am no longer auditing you.

316
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:36,398
- What?
- I'm no longer auditing you.

317
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,189
Look.

318
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,470
The needle's floating, and you are clear.

319
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:52,310
I wanna get off my anti-depressants.

320
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:57,152
I think that's what we all want, Matt.
Eventually.

321
00:23:58,600 --> 00:23:59,715
I mean now.

322
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:03,835
- And I wanna stop going to the shrink, too.
- Hold on.

323
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:08,236
You asked us all to get together for a
discussion, not a press statement.

324
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:10,390
I don't think
you're ready to stop treatment.

325
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:15,270
No, I don't wanna stop treatment.
I just want a different kind of treatment.

326
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:19,749
We could find another psychiatrist.

327
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:30,875
Look.

328
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:36,472
I didn't come here to ask your permission.

329
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:38,958
I'm not a kid anymore.

330
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:44,034
And what I put into my body
or into my mind has to be my decision.

331
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:47,872
Okay, now,
I'm committed to getting better

332
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:52,511
and, you know, I've found something
that I know can help me.

333
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,195
What?

334
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:01,313
It's a new religion.

335
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:04,200
But I'm gonna need some money to join,

336
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:07,078
and I was hoping
that I could use the money

337
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:10,709
that you're throwing away on all the drugs
and the shrink for this instead.

338
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:12,472
What new religion?

339
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:16,595
Scientology.

340
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:19,315
You're out of your fricking mind.

341
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:22,676
It's not a group you wanna get involved
with, Matt. It's not gonna help you.

342
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:24,751
- How do you know?
- I've read about it.

343
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:26,876
Yeah, from people
who don't have any first-hand experience.

344
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:27,995
You're not getting a dime.

345
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:30,833
In fact, all this does is prove to me
that you're not taking enough drugs.

346
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:33,559
No, no! I've experienced it, man. It works.

347
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:36,877
Look, this is the real deal, okay?

348
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:38,279
I mean, I saw how it helped her.

349
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:41,750
I know the hell she went through
and it saved her life.

350
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:43,518
Saved whose life?

351
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,389
Kimber's.

352
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:51,958
And it can save mine, too.

353
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:05,599
Coming! Coming. Keep your pants on!

354
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:07,557
Jesus. Who is it?

355
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:16,629
Remember me?

356
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:18,753
Go away, Christian.

357
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:22,400
Open the door, Kimber.
I need to talk to you.

358
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:25,309
Go away! I'm not gonna let you in.

359
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:32,637
You scared, baby?

360
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:37,594
Come on, I'd never hurt that
perfectly reconstructed body of yours.

361
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:39,079
It's my best work.

362
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:44,439
Please, Christian. I can't see you anymore.

363
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:47,398
- You're not good for me.
- But my son is, huh?

364
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:50,997
Is that why you went after him?
Or was it to get to me?

365
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:56,756
I didn't go after Matt. We met at the gym.

366
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:58,996
He's miserable and lost.

367
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:01,594
And you decided what?
That you'd rescue him?

368
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:05,800
Maybe put him in one of your movies?

369
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:10,151
Sweet pad you got here.

370
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:12,593
What did you do? Move into snuff films?

371
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:15,035
I don't do that sort of work anymore.

372
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:18,908
I found something much more compatible
with my core values.

373
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,991
Kiddie porn? Oh, yeah.

374
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:23,559
Matt's almost 18.

375
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:26,757
You must be talking about that brain suck
you convinced him to join.

376
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:29,957
It's a religion, Christian.

377
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:32,237
I needed something spiritual...

378
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:36,199
That's bullshit and you know it!
What we had was spiritual, Kimber!

379
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:39,719
I made you see God every time you came.

380
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:42,553
You made me see garbage, Christian.

381
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:43,993
I was nothing to you.

382
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:47,709
I was a fixer-upper
that you could throw a coat of paint on.

383
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:49,870
You are such a freaking hypocrite.

384
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:52,838
You're the one who seduced me
when you realized I was a plastic surgeon

385
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:55,309
who could get you everything you wanted.

386
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:58,353
You were never anything more than
an ambitious piece of ass.

387
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:01,000
You need to go. You need to go right now.

388
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:03,478
How much more pain
do you need to cause me

389
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:05,790
before you think I've had enough?

390
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:14,670
Look, whatever I did,
whatever we did to each other...

391
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:17,794
I loved you.

392
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,956
You loved your creation.

393
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:24,749
You never loved me
because you never saw who I really was.

394
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:26,512
I was just something
made up in your head.

395
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:28,431
Well, I see you now, Kimber.

396
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:34,358
And you know what?
You're dangerous because you're weak.

397
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:39,351
You can't survive without someone
or something to suck off.

398
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:41,351
A new lover, a new religion.

399
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:45,350
But if you start feeding on my son,

400
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:52,357
I swear, there's not one place on Earth
that will keep you safe from me.

401
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:58,593
You can bill me for the door.

402
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:27,473
I don't recall Mrs. Beazer
having such enormous tits.

403
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:28,549
Yeah, I rescheduled her.

404
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:31,950
You don't just bump a patient
without telling me first, Christian.

405
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:34,952
I wouldn't bump Mrs. Beazer
if it meant world peace.

406
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:36,678
I just put Blu Mondae in her slot.

407
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:38,557
- Blue Monday?
- Yeah.

408
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:41,359
No "e" at the end of Blu, but one
at the end of Monday instead of a "y".

409
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:44,512
You brought a hooker in here?
I want her off that table.

410
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,514
Sean, we've got a problem
in the scrub room.

411
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:58,708
You're telling me
you're doing this slut for free?

412
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:01,109
We said no more
boob jobs for blowjobs, Christian.

413
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,395
- I thought we agreed.
- Oh, come on! Take a look.

414
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:06,074
It's obvious that Blu Mondae
needs to lighten her load.

415
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:07,912
- It's called pro bono.
- Blue Monday?

416
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,673
With an "e" instead of a "y".
Don't give me that look.

417
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:12,830
What's the difference between me
giving her a breast reduction

418
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:14,114
and whatever you're doing
with Mr. Coffee?

419
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:15,235
Who the hell is Mr. Coffee?

420
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:17,788
The guy with the deformed face
Sean operated on yesterday.

421
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:20,075
What do you get for that in return, huh?
Lattes?

422
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:22,674
- That's totally different!
- That's enough, both of you.

423
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:24,512
You work for me now, okay?

424
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:26,910
I own your practice and your name.

425
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,958
Speaking of names,
where's your husband, huh?

426
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:32,235
Isn't he the Landau in Landau Industries?

427
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:33,469
My husband has empowered me

428
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:35,994
to make all business decisions
during his recuperation,

429
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:38,230
which means I can replace you both

430
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:41,995
with other highly-skilled surgeons
whose clientele can actually pay.

431
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,275
Alex has Treacher Collins.
It's not the same.

432
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:53,555
They both have physical problems
that need treating.

433
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:56,234
What makes his face more deserving
than her tits?

434
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:59,676
You're right, Christian.
You're just a goddamn Mother Teresa.

435
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:03,189
Thanks for backing me up there, partner.

436
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:13,155
Matt, would you ask Mom
to pass the ketchup, please?

437
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:16,118
Oh, Annie, for God's sake.
Now, I said I was sorry.

438
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:20,193
- What more do you want me to do?
- Yeah. Come on, squirt, give her a break.

439
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:25,794
All right, that's it. Just leave the table!

440
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:28,758
Fine!
You're the reason the baby's deformed!

441
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:41,951
Don't let her get you down, okay?

442
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:44,873
- It's just early-onset adolescence.
- Yeah.

443
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:48,672
Well, whatever it is,
I don't think I can take it right now.

444
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:50,716
No, hey. You sit. Let me clear.

445
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:55,039
Thanks, sweetie.

446
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:05,393
I should never have gone back to work
last year.

447
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:07,789
You were right to go after your dreams.

448
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:10,872
Annie has to learn
to work through her issues.

449
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:13,630
You know,
you take away your children's problems

450
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:16,314
and you weaken their ability
to overcome them.

451
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:21,153
You know, I think that therapist
is really helping.

452
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:25,914
- Maybe I should book an appointment.
- I stopped seeing him.

453
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:29,589
- What?
- I found something better.

454
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:34,590
It's kind of a spiritual skill set
for handling life.

455
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:37,393
I don't understand.

456
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:41,915
There's a life force inside all of us

457
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,151
that reveals itself
as we become more conscious.

458
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:48,119
It's called theta.

459
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:04,073
If you're waiting for me to apologize,
forget it.

460
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:13,476
The girl needed a breast reduction
and she couldn't pay for it.

461
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:18,958
Look, just because
I spend all my time around hookers

462
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:21,235
and you spend all your time around coffee,
doesn't mean...

463
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:24,278
You're right. I should've backed you up.

464
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:30,557
I'm sorry. I'm just under a lot of stress.

465
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:47,154
I get it.

466
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:53,750
So, what are we gonna do about Matt?

467
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:55,834
I don't know.

468
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:59,598
I'm open to suggestions.

469
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:03,350
I say we cut him off financially.

470
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:04,759
And make sure Julia's in on it,

471
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:08,230
that way the little shit
can't play us off against each other.

472
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:09,793
I'll talk to her.

473
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:13,276
No, let's talk to her together.

474
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:18,994
She can argue with one of us, but,
united, she doesn't stand a chance.

475
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:39,952
- Mitchell?
- Yeah, I'm sorry. I just...

476
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:45,918
Arthur found out about me going to the
strip club. About Blu and me.

477
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,117
And he freaked. He went all crazy.
He kicked me out.

478
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:51,760
He took the clothes, the car, everything.

479
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:55,029
Jesus.

480
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:58,708
Come in.

481
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:11,953
Why don't you go down
to the Ocean View on Washington?

482
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:14,793
I'll call them,
let them know that you're coming.

483
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:18,117
You can stay there for a week or two.

484
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:19,748
My treat.

485
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:21,796
- I appreciate that.
- Of course.

486
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:26,468
And here. Just to... Just to tide you over.

487
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:31,349
500 bucks?

488
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:36,070
That's really generous.

489
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,752
It's kind of late. You should probably...

490
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:45,479
Can I use your bathroom before I go?

491
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:47,395
Sure.

492
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,274
Oh, shit.

493
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:13,314
- You got a really nice place here.
- Yeah...

494
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:20,313
- What the hell are you doing?
- I like to work for my money.

495
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:24,917
How about I give you
the best blowjob you've ever had?

496
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:27,916
And, then, maybe I could stay here.

497
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:32,595
I told you, asshole, I'm not gay.

498
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:39,590
Get your clothes
and get the hell out of here.

499
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:47,312
Gay, straight, bi.
Who gives a shit about labels, right?

500
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:52,996
A blowjob's a blowjob.

501
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:02,794
Get out!

502
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:06,836
Get out,
before I break your goddamn skull!

503
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:11,634
Get out!

504
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:20,597
You can see how steep
the occlusal plane angle is here.

505
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:24,197
That's the surface
where the upper and lower teeth meet.

506
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:25,713
In the least severe cases,

507
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:27,870
surgical repositioning
of the upper and lower jaws

508
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:30,030
is usually enough to normalize the angle.

509
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:31,758
But not with me, right?

510
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:34,557
'Cause I'm Mr. Lucky.

511
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:38,673
There's a procedure

512
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:41,800
where we'd connect an expansion rod
on the outside of your face

513
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:44,235
and turn it periodically
to lengthen your jaw.

514
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:46,470
You'd need three or four years of
orthodontics, but...

515
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:49,279
No. I'm not interested.

516
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:52,591
I'm used to this level of ugly.

517
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:56,992
I don't need to add wires to my face
to scare more people away.

518
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:59,116
It would be temporary.
Once the jaw's lengthened...

519
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:01,839
No, I don't wanna go through the pain.

520
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:05,798
I knew this was a mistake.

521
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:10,357
Maybe if my parents
would have done something

522
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:12,590
when I was young it could've worked.

523
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:15,554
But they didn't. It's just me now.

524
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:28,436
Nice place you're working at.

525
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:32,069
Classy.

526
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:39,358
- I was just going to...
- Well, I thought I'd surprise you.

527
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:49,676
It's more fun like this.

528
00:38:57,720 --> 00:39:01,838
I'm not even gonna count it.
That's how much I trust you.

529
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:07,999
You look good.

530
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:28,033
Lovelier than ever.

531
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:44,199
Sooner than later.

532
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:57,072
How could you give him money?

533
00:39:57,160 --> 00:39:58,639
Do you have any idea
who these people are?

534
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:00,438
They're people who are helping him.

535
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:01,953
Like who? Like Kimber?

536
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:03,951
You should've discussed this
with me, Julia.

537
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:05,758
Why? You already turned him down.

538
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:07,637
We both agreed
a psychiatrist was the way to go...

539
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:12,271
When you see your happy child turn into
a morose, clinically depressed young man,

540
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:14,476
you do whatever it takes
to make him happy again

541
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:17,313
before he decides
that he can't take it anymore.

542
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:26,309
She's got a point.
You don't know how depressed he's been.

543
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:32,317
Why don't you just give him a lobotomy
and admit you're throwing in the towel?

544
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:34,789
He has been high maintenance and
with a special needs baby...

545
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:37,269
- That's not fair!
- No, but it's true.

546
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,911
Matt's my kid,
and he has special needs, too.

547
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:43,197
And I'm not giving up on him
just because his parents are!

548
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:47,511
Oh, God.

549
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:55,508
I mean,
he would have found the money anyway.

550
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:57,238
He was that determined.

551
00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:00,988
Do you think I did the wrong thing?

552
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:06,636
I don't know. But I don't think it matters.

553
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:10,839
Matt's fully cooked.

554
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:14,235
It's too late
to change the ingredients now.

555
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:15,833
You do what you can, when you can.

556
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:18,434
When there's still enough time
to make a difference.

557
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:19,635
Yeah.

558
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:37,309
Julia,

559
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:42,310
I wanna do an operation on the baby.

560
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:46,749
We can close the cleft,
reconstruct the thumb,

561
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:49,110
improve his hand functioning,
his motor skills.

562
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:51,430
It may take multiple surgeries,
I can't know that yet,

563
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:53,158
but I wanna do it soon,

564
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:55,319
while he's still too young to understand,

565
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:58,119
before he knows enough
to be afraid of the pain.

566
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:04,798
Okay. Yeah.

567
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:09,268
Do it, Sean.

568
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:15,631
I mean, if life is this hard for a kid
like Matt with 10 fingers and 10 toes,

569
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:20,189
can you imagine
how tough it's gonna be for Conor?

570
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:24,159
So, we've decided?

571
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:27,159
On the name, I mean?

572
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:31,035
Yeah. Conor McNamara.

573
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:39,031
It's a good strong name, isn't it?

574
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:44,717
- Yes.
- Like his father's.

575
00:42:58,320 --> 00:42:59,355
I mean, the name Blu Mondae

576
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:02,477
just didn't feel like me anymore
since I got my tits done.

577
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:04,198
Want me to touch myself?

578
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:06,073
Sure, whatever.

579
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:09,755
I'm gonna get out of here,
once I decide what I wanna do, you know?

580
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:12,237
Course the tips are good.

581
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:17,189
Lots of guys like a flat-chested girl.
I'm really busy. But not for you.

582
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:19,840
Anytime you want a dance,
just ask for Ashley.

583
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:22,954
Ashley Wednesday, that's my new name.

584
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:25,758
It's a lot classier, don't you think?

585
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:03,709
