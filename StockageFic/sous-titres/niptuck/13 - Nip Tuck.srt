00:00:00,985 --> 00:00:02,816
<i>Previously on</i> Nip / Tuck:

2
00:00:02,887 --> 00:00:05,515
That's right, asshole. I'm pregnant.

3
00:00:05,590 --> 00:00:07,387
I told you I couldn't do this alone.

4
00:00:07,458 --> 00:00:08,686
You can't do it at all.

5
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:10,990
Why couldn't you just love me?

6
00:00:11,229 --> 00:00:13,197
I've never loved anyone.

7
00:00:14,198 --> 00:00:16,826
You think you can ever love me again?

8
00:00:19,037 --> 00:00:20,026
I don't know.

9
00:00:20,104 --> 00:00:21,298
Bye, pumpkin.

10
00:00:21,372 --> 00:00:25,274
You continue to work on my clients,
and I let your family live in peace.

11
00:01:11,723 --> 00:01:13,190
Skin stapler.

12
00:01:19,697 --> 00:01:20,925
I need an end date.

13
00:01:20,999 --> 00:01:22,967
This is the 10th girl
we've done this month.

14
00:01:23,034 --> 00:01:24,831
How many more people
do you have to hurt?

15
00:01:24,902 --> 00:01:26,369
When will you have enough money?

16
00:01:26,437 --> 00:01:28,405
I feeI your pain, Sean, I really do.

17
00:01:28,473 --> 00:01:30,839
But, you know, islands are expensive.

18
00:01:32,910 --> 00:01:33,968
Liz.

19
00:01:36,447 --> 00:01:38,813
Keep your evening free tomorrow.

20
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:41,675
We have a 4:00 a.m. flight coming in.

21
00:01:42,153 --> 00:01:44,587
By the way, where's your partner?

22
00:01:58,369 --> 00:02:00,030
Sorry for the delay, Christian.

23
00:02:00,104 --> 00:02:04,438
Merrill's upstairs supervising
the installation of a new 12-jet shower.

24
00:02:07,278 --> 00:02:10,441
Arsenic or strychnine?
What's your poison?

25
00:02:11,916 --> 00:02:13,440
Absolut. Neat.

26
00:02:16,587 --> 00:02:18,919
From modeI to maid
in less than six months.

27
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:22,187
That's quite a tumble
down life's slippery slope, sweetheart.

28
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:24,455
I'm hardly a maid, Christian.

29
00:02:25,263 --> 00:02:28,858
ln fact, I tell the maids what to do now.

30
00:02:33,604 --> 00:02:34,935
Nice ring.

31
00:02:35,006 --> 00:02:37,975
Merrill and l
are getting married in December.

32
00:02:39,477 --> 00:02:43,937
I knew you weren't smart, Kimber,
but I didn't realize you were that dumb.

33
00:02:44,482 --> 00:02:48,282
Dumb would be signing a prenup,
which I refuse to do.

34
00:02:48,786 --> 00:02:51,448
So you're getting everything but love.

35
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:55,222
I don't believe in love anymore.

36
00:02:55,893 --> 00:02:58,293
What I do believe in is security.

37
00:02:58,529 --> 00:03:01,657
And getting what's coming to me.

38
00:03:05,403 --> 00:03:06,893
Jesus, Kimber.

39
00:03:06,971 --> 00:03:08,370
Oh, please.

40
00:03:08,806 --> 00:03:11,468
Nine months ago,
you were sniffing this stuff off my ass.

41
00:03:11,542 --> 00:03:14,340
-Well, I'm trying to change.
-Yeah, right.

42
00:03:17,949 --> 00:03:19,814
I'm gonna be a father.

43
00:03:27,458 --> 00:03:29,756
How sad for that innocent baby.

44
00:03:31,295 --> 00:03:33,354
Have you destroyed the mother-to-be yet?

45
00:03:33,431 --> 00:03:34,864
I told you. I've changed.

46
00:03:34,932 --> 00:03:38,424
Bullshit, Christian.
You're a seriaI heartbreaker.

47
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:42,797
How many more women can you hurt?
When is enough, enough?

48
00:03:43,508 --> 00:03:46,944
lsn't being tied to a bed and slashed
penance enough?

49
00:03:49,347 --> 00:03:51,372
That's only the beginning.

50
00:03:52,583 --> 00:03:53,914
Hey, babe?

51
00:03:54,418 --> 00:03:56,045
Shower's working.

52
00:03:56,254 --> 00:03:59,451
Lather up and save me a spot.
I'll be up in a few.

53
00:04:15,006 --> 00:04:17,031
Don't say it. I know. I'm whipped.

54
00:04:17,108 --> 00:04:18,871
She's using you, Merrill.

55
00:04:18,943 --> 00:04:21,912
I love her, Christian.
God help me, I love her.

56
00:04:24,048 --> 00:04:25,538
What can I do you for?

57
00:04:25,616 --> 00:04:27,846
I think you know why I'm here.

58
00:04:31,489 --> 00:04:33,218
Doesn't she look fantastic?

59
00:04:33,291 --> 00:04:36,749
That she does, thanks to me.
I did her plastic surgery, not you.

60
00:04:36,828 --> 00:04:39,092
That's false advertising. You pull that ad--

61
00:04:39,163 --> 00:04:41,028
Or what? You'll alert the media?

62
00:04:43,134 --> 00:04:45,068
ls your business that bad, Christian...

63
00:04:45,136 --> 00:04:47,900
that a little ad campaign
is grounds for a face to face?

64
00:04:47,972 --> 00:04:49,997
Why are you playing dirty pool?

65
00:04:50,074 --> 00:04:52,269
Six months ago,
you wanted me to be your partner.

66
00:04:52,343 --> 00:04:55,005
You're either my partner or my enemy.
I'm a sore loser.

67
00:04:55,079 --> 00:04:56,706
And so is Kimber.

68
00:04:59,617 --> 00:05:01,778
Doesn't it bother you, Merrill...

69
00:05:01,853 --> 00:05:05,118
that she's thinking of me
while you're banging her?

70
00:05:07,525 --> 00:05:11,552
Actually, it does, Christian,
which is why I'm running you out of town.

71
00:05:12,196 --> 00:05:13,629
I am not going anywhere.

72
00:05:13,698 --> 00:05:16,690
You will if I take all your clients,
which I intend to do.

73
00:05:16,767 --> 00:05:20,498
You think this ad is bad for business?
Wait and see next week's campaign...

74
00:05:20,571 --> 00:05:23,335
where I promise to beat
any estimate in town.

75
00:05:23,407 --> 00:05:25,898
A few months from now,
you'll have no other choice...

76
00:05:25,977 --> 00:05:28,241
but to declare bankruptcy
and move to Tampa.

77
00:05:28,312 --> 00:05:31,839
And then you'll be but a distant memory
for my bride-to-be.

78
00:05:36,888 --> 00:05:39,823
You were never really good
at marketing yourself.

79
00:05:39,891 --> 00:05:41,688
Luckily for me, I am.

80
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,987
You know the way out.

81
00:05:45,529 --> 00:05:46,757
Sweetie?

82
00:06:42,019 --> 00:06:45,250
<i>Good job, honey.</i>
<i>You're a full 10-centimeters dilated.</i>

83
00:06:45,323 --> 00:06:47,188
<i>All right, ready? Push.</i>

84
00:06:47,258 --> 00:06:49,385
<i>I'm trying. I can't feeI anything.</i>

85
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:52,088
<i>That's normal.</i>
<i>The epidural's numbed the lumbar area.</i>

86
00:06:52,163 --> 00:06:54,893
<i>Now, just bear down, squeeze and exhale.</i>

87
00:06:57,001 --> 00:06:59,697
<i>Sit up and pretend you're trying</i>
<i>to break wind.</i>

88
00:07:00,071 --> 00:07:02,562
<i>Christian, this is serious. Please.</i>

89
00:07:07,178 --> 00:07:09,772
<i>-Wait, there's the head!</i>
<i>-There's the head!</i>

90
00:07:09,847 --> 00:07:12,611
Christ. It looks like
you barely broke a sweat.

91
00:07:12,683 --> 00:07:14,810
-FeeI a little better now?
-Are you kidding?

92
00:07:14,885 --> 00:07:18,013
Watching this, I want an epidural
with my oatmeaI every morning.

93
00:07:18,089 --> 00:07:19,784
Did you have any pain at all?

94
00:07:19,857 --> 00:07:23,588
Not untiI my oldest got to be about 15.
Now it doesn't stop.

95
00:07:27,598 --> 00:07:30,328
Thanks for letting me watch this, Julia.

96
00:07:31,202 --> 00:07:35,696
Christian thought you might be able to
help me get prepared for what's coming.

97
00:07:35,773 --> 00:07:37,331
You're never prepared.

98
00:07:37,708 --> 00:07:39,699
Giving birth is one thing...

99
00:07:39,777 --> 00:07:42,871
but raising kids,
and trying to keep a family together...

100
00:07:42,947 --> 00:07:45,472
that's something entirely different.

101
00:07:48,786 --> 00:07:50,549
-More coffee?
-Sure.

102
00:07:58,462 --> 00:08:02,489
Christian never told me
that he was with you in the delivery room.

103
00:08:03,634 --> 00:08:06,034
Originally, it was meant to just be Sean.

104
00:08:06,103 --> 00:08:09,038
He was my birth coach for eight months...

105
00:08:09,106 --> 00:08:12,303
untiI he decided
he wanted to deliver the baby.

106
00:08:12,777 --> 00:08:16,338
So he swapped places with the doctor,
who shot the video...

107
00:08:17,648 --> 00:08:21,277
and Christian volunteered to step in
at the last minute.

108
00:08:21,352 --> 00:08:22,444
Why?

109
00:08:22,987 --> 00:08:25,319
I mean, what was in it for him?

110
00:08:28,459 --> 00:08:31,087
The three of us used to be very close.

111
00:08:34,765 --> 00:08:36,528
He scares me, Julia.

112
00:08:38,569 --> 00:08:42,630
He's never had another responsibility
in his life besides himself.

113
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:45,506
He's not gonna be a good father.

114
00:08:46,177 --> 00:08:48,543
I think you're wrong about that.

115
00:08:49,713 --> 00:08:51,681
He taught Annie to swim.

116
00:08:54,118 --> 00:08:57,212
When Matt was a baby,
he was so serious...

117
00:08:57,288 --> 00:09:01,884
untiI Christian walked in the room
with his silly voices and that smile.

118
00:09:04,895 --> 00:09:07,728
He's been there for them all these years.

119
00:09:10,835 --> 00:09:14,362
It sounds like he's as much
a father to them as Sean is.

120
00:10:02,286 --> 00:10:05,687
Mr. Parks, tell me
what you don't like about yourself.

121
00:10:05,756 --> 00:10:07,690
Sir Winston needs plugs.

122
00:10:07,758 --> 00:10:09,851
Your partner needs a hair transplant?

123
00:10:09,927 --> 00:10:11,918
Sir Winston isn't my partner.

124
00:10:11,996 --> 00:10:14,794
Sir Winston of Glenrock is my dog.

125
00:10:17,001 --> 00:10:19,435
Darling, there we are.

126
00:10:20,504 --> 00:10:23,405
The tuft on his head
began to thin a year ago.

127
00:10:23,474 --> 00:10:26,272
The stress of the competitions, I presume.

128
00:10:26,343 --> 00:10:30,143
Fullness of mane is an entire point
in the grooming category.

129
00:10:30,915 --> 00:10:35,215
That's why that pug bitch pulled ahead
of us last year at Westminster.

130
00:10:37,488 --> 00:10:41,822
I want some hair from Sir Winston's tail
transplanted to the front.

131
00:10:43,627 --> 00:10:46,425
I'm sorry, Mr. Parks.
Your request is out of the question.

132
00:10:46,497 --> 00:10:48,260
It's inhumane, excessive--

133
00:10:48,332 --> 00:10:51,267
Plenty of others do it and get away with it.

134
00:10:51,335 --> 00:10:54,031
Every year, millions of dollars
of dog show dividends...

135
00:10:54,104 --> 00:10:56,766
are stolen by surgically-enhanced frauds.

136
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:59,035
Shar-Peis shot full of BOTOX.

137
00:10:59,810 --> 00:11:02,506
-Poodles with Neuticles.
-Neuticles?

138
00:11:03,113 --> 00:11:04,910
ArtificiaI testicles.

139
00:11:06,717 --> 00:11:08,844
Dr. Troy, Dr. McNamara...

140
00:11:08,919 --> 00:11:12,047
the world of kenneI clubs
is a dog-eat-dog world.

141
00:11:12,122 --> 00:11:15,250
lf Sir Winston places first
in his scheduled dog shows...

142
00:11:15,326 --> 00:11:18,261
then I stand to make
about $1 million a year.

143
00:11:18,696 --> 00:11:21,756
You can see why I'm willing
to take this chance.

144
00:11:21,832 --> 00:11:23,766
That doesn't make it ethical.

145
00:11:23,834 --> 00:11:26,928
Yes, well, we live in a world...

146
00:11:27,004 --> 00:11:30,872
where physicaI perfection
is not just expected, it's demanded.

147
00:11:31,108 --> 00:11:34,202
Thanks, in part,
to advances in your profession.

148
00:11:35,713 --> 00:11:37,340
We don't do dogs.

149
00:11:37,815 --> 00:11:40,045
Not even for $100,000?

150
00:11:40,951 --> 00:11:44,751
And $50,000 more
to ensure doctor-patient confidentiality?

151
00:11:54,465 --> 00:11:58,026
I'm just saying that we shouldn't
dismiss this out of hand, or paw.

152
00:11:58,102 --> 00:12:00,093
Christian, we're doctors, not vets.

153
00:12:00,170 --> 00:12:03,435
ln case you haven't noticed,
we're a little short on liquid capital.

154
00:12:03,507 --> 00:12:05,168
We need to take on this client.

155
00:12:05,242 --> 00:12:07,005
Remember what happened the last time...

156
00:12:07,077 --> 00:12:09,068
we took on a patient
for the love of money?

157
00:12:09,146 --> 00:12:12,707
It's not love, Sean, it's need.
God damn it, we're tapped.

158
00:12:12,783 --> 00:12:14,614
Bobolit is stealing our client base.

159
00:12:14,685 --> 00:12:18,519
We're canceling on the ones that remain
to carve up mules at a moment's notice.

160
00:12:18,589 --> 00:12:22,252
How do you plan to keep the place running
without an influx of cash?

161
00:12:22,826 --> 00:12:24,589
We need to downsize.

162
00:12:27,464 --> 00:12:28,692
I agree.

163
00:12:29,333 --> 00:12:31,631
I'll fire Dr. Santiago tomorrow.

164
00:12:31,702 --> 00:12:35,570
You can't fire Grace because
you can't keep your dick in your pants.

165
00:12:35,639 --> 00:12:37,368
You think
we're hemorrhaging money now?

166
00:12:37,441 --> 00:12:41,138
Just wait till her lawyers slam us
with a sexuaI harassment suit.

167
00:12:45,983 --> 00:12:47,348
Look at us.

168
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:51,744
Look at what we've become.

169
00:12:51,822 --> 00:12:55,280
We're actually considering
taking on a dog as a client.

170
00:12:57,828 --> 00:13:01,093
ls this where you thought
we'd be at 40, Christian?

171
00:13:02,232 --> 00:13:05,531
Further behind and more confused
than we were at 24?

172
00:13:24,388 --> 00:13:26,948
I won't even ask you where you were...

173
00:13:27,658 --> 00:13:30,559
because I know
you wouldn't tell me, anyway.

174
00:13:33,864 --> 00:13:35,491
I know it's late.

175
00:13:36,567 --> 00:13:38,558
I didn't want to wake you.

176
00:13:39,603 --> 00:13:42,504
I don't even know
who you are anymore, Sean.

177
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:46,376
What you're thinking,
where you go, what you do.

178
00:13:49,246 --> 00:13:51,237
You just have to trust me, Julia.

179
00:13:51,315 --> 00:13:52,407
Do l?

180
00:13:53,150 --> 00:13:54,777
What if I can't?

181
00:13:57,855 --> 00:14:00,949
lf you're thinking
it's another woman, it's not.

182
00:14:07,364 --> 00:14:09,161
Matt's check bounced.

183
00:14:12,603 --> 00:14:15,504
I went to use my credit card.
It was denied.

184
00:14:15,873 --> 00:14:17,636
lnsufficient funds.

185
00:14:21,912 --> 00:14:24,210
I can't talk about this, Julia.

186
00:14:25,215 --> 00:14:26,739
Neither can l.

187
00:14:27,818 --> 00:14:29,217
Not anymore.

188
00:14:35,426 --> 00:14:37,121
Do you need money?

189
00:14:38,562 --> 00:14:39,824
Use this.

190
00:14:42,766 --> 00:14:45,564
I'm not selling your wedding ring, Julia.

191
00:14:46,403 --> 00:14:47,893
We'll be fine.

192
00:14:48,172 --> 00:14:52,040
We're not fine, Sean. And we never will be.

193
00:14:52,876 --> 00:14:55,071
You know it. We both know it.

194
00:14:58,715 --> 00:15:00,706
Don't you give up on me.

195
00:15:04,688 --> 00:15:08,647
There's nothing wrong
in knowing when to surrender.

196
00:15:09,893 --> 00:15:11,554
We tried our best.

197
00:15:12,496 --> 00:15:16,626
No one can fauIt us for finally admitting...

198
00:15:17,501 --> 00:15:19,901
that we just can't do it anymore.

199
00:15:31,949 --> 00:15:35,009
My grandmother thought
you were perfect for me.

200
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:38,885
Exactly what I needed.

201
00:15:47,798 --> 00:15:49,629
I don't want it back.

202
00:15:50,901 --> 00:15:53,768
It's a family heirloom. It belongs to you.

203
00:15:58,442 --> 00:15:59,807
It's yours.

204
00:16:02,379 --> 00:16:06,008
We haven't been family
for a long time, Sean.

205
00:16:07,317 --> 00:16:09,751
We might as well make it official.

206
00:16:33,076 --> 00:16:36,409
Christian was such a dumbass
for turning this one down.

207
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,448
Easiest $100,000 I'll ever make.

208
00:16:38,515 --> 00:16:40,415
And a new low, even for you.

209
00:16:40,484 --> 00:16:44,250
Debbie, if I wanted to be emasculated,
I'd stay home with my girlfriend. Okay?

210
00:16:44,321 --> 00:16:47,051
I pay you for your skill, not your lip.

211
00:16:47,424 --> 00:16:50,552
-Has he gotten all his halothane?
-Yep. Two max.

212
00:16:50,627 --> 00:16:52,959
Okay. Let's rock.

213
00:17:26,396 --> 00:17:29,695
-What's happening?
-I think this puppy just stroked out.

214
00:17:29,766 --> 00:17:31,495
Well, do something.

215
00:17:31,935 --> 00:17:33,664
-Like mouth-to-mouth?
-Yes.

216
00:17:33,737 --> 00:17:36,433
-Screw you, asshole!
-Shit!

217
00:17:37,808 --> 00:17:39,332
Come on, puppy.

218
00:17:53,557 --> 00:17:54,649
Shit!

219
00:18:13,777 --> 00:18:15,074
This is good.

220
00:18:16,146 --> 00:18:18,580
It's mahi-mahi with an Asian slaw.

221
00:18:18,749 --> 00:18:20,774
I found the recipe online.

222
00:18:22,185 --> 00:18:24,915
So what do you want?
You need something?

223
00:18:28,558 --> 00:18:30,549
I need you to make love to me.

224
00:18:31,261 --> 00:18:33,627
You'd better have made
a kick-ass dessert, too.

225
00:18:33,697 --> 00:18:36,962
I am serious, Christian.
I got to get this baby out of me.

226
00:18:37,034 --> 00:18:40,993
My back aches. My bowels are clogged up
like a ballpark toilet.

227
00:18:41,071 --> 00:18:44,234
Your seduction technique needs work.

228
00:18:45,142 --> 00:18:48,236
My OB said I need to have sex
to facilitate labor.

229
00:18:48,645 --> 00:18:50,670
Something about
the contraction of my orgasm.

230
00:18:50,747 --> 00:18:52,840
And apparently semen is gonna make the--

231
00:18:52,916 --> 00:18:54,645
I've been informed.

232
00:19:02,626 --> 00:19:04,958
I really do need you, Christian.

233
00:19:09,766 --> 00:19:13,827
You know, your dick started this mess.
Now it's time for it to finish it.

234
00:19:28,085 --> 00:19:30,986
-You're too heavy. You're crushing me.
-Oh, Jesus.

235
00:19:31,054 --> 00:19:34,922
No, Christian. That's not it.
You're missing it. It's not working.

236
00:19:34,991 --> 00:19:37,824
-My back.
-Didn't you shave your legs?

237
00:19:37,894 --> 00:19:41,330
Have you ever tried shaving your legs
when you're nine months pregnant?

238
00:19:41,398 --> 00:19:44,959
-Look, I'm trying to help here.
-It's not working, is it?

239
00:19:46,103 --> 00:19:48,333
-Put your leg up there.
-There.

240
00:19:50,307 --> 00:19:52,707
Jesus, how do fat people have sex?

241
00:19:54,778 --> 00:19:57,338
All right. Let's try something.

242
00:20:25,075 --> 00:20:26,838
-ls that good?
-Yeah.

243
00:20:42,492 --> 00:20:45,120
Oh, Christian. I want to thank you.

244
00:20:46,196 --> 00:20:49,131
I wanna thank you
for everything you've done.

245
00:20:50,867 --> 00:20:53,392
You're gonna be a really good daddy.

246
00:21:01,444 --> 00:21:02,706
Oh, God.

247
00:21:07,484 --> 00:21:10,317
So I've had an epiphany about fatherhood.

248
00:21:11,888 --> 00:21:14,880
A day ago,
I was literally living a nightmare.

249
00:21:15,826 --> 00:21:19,091
But something's shifting.

250
00:21:20,831 --> 00:21:22,355
Gina's trying.

251
00:21:23,233 --> 00:21:25,633
She's actually kind of a trouper.

252
00:21:26,903 --> 00:21:30,634
Are you saying, you think
you two might make it as a couple?

253
00:21:30,874 --> 00:21:33,672
Shit, no. But as parents....

254
00:21:38,248 --> 00:21:42,309
The other day, you asked me,
is this where I thought I'd be at 40?

255
00:21:43,286 --> 00:21:45,186
The truth is, I didn't.

256
00:21:47,190 --> 00:21:49,181
I thought I'd be retired.

257
00:21:49,259 --> 00:21:53,821
Living in a Polynesian villa.
Giving the locaI girls the Bali Hai hard one.

258
00:21:59,669 --> 00:22:01,967
I never thought I'd be a father.

259
00:22:02,472 --> 00:22:04,736
I didn't think I had it in me.

260
00:22:05,976 --> 00:22:07,739
But in many ways...

261
00:22:09,479 --> 00:22:12,676
I'm more of a man now
than I ever thought I'd be.

262
00:22:23,126 --> 00:22:25,560
Julia and I are getting a divorce.

263
00:22:26,796 --> 00:22:29,629
I moved over to the Franklin this morning.

264
00:22:29,699 --> 00:22:32,395
Sean, she'll get over the affair.
It just takes time.

265
00:22:32,469 --> 00:22:34,266
It's done, Christian.

266
00:22:38,775 --> 00:22:40,709
It's ironic, isn't it?

267
00:22:41,878 --> 00:22:44,369
Just as you're starting a family...

268
00:22:45,882 --> 00:22:47,406
I'm losing one.

269
00:23:09,372 --> 00:23:11,169
-ls she under?
-Yeah.

270
00:23:12,976 --> 00:23:14,967
All right. Let's do this.

271
00:23:35,432 --> 00:23:37,024
That the last implant?

272
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:41,002
Unless you made the poor girI eat one
just for shits and giggles, yes.

273
00:23:43,707 --> 00:23:45,504
Pepe, get the cooler.

274
00:23:49,713 --> 00:23:53,149
Don't just stand there, gentlemen.
Stitch the girI up.

275
00:24:06,363 --> 00:24:07,921
What's that for?

276
00:24:07,998 --> 00:24:10,762
That's where I'm gonna store the kidney.

277
00:24:11,301 --> 00:24:12,666
I'm sorry?

278
00:24:12,969 --> 00:24:16,700
You heard me. Slice her open
and give me one of her kidneys.

279
00:24:17,173 --> 00:24:19,300
Why do you want her kidney?

280
00:24:19,642 --> 00:24:21,303
Organ harvesting.

281
00:24:22,645 --> 00:24:25,239
See, there's a lot of rich drunks
in this country.

282
00:24:25,315 --> 00:24:27,681
And they're willing to pay me top dollar.

283
00:24:27,751 --> 00:24:30,652
One kidney, I make $50,000.

284
00:24:32,689 --> 00:24:34,816
So, open her up.

285
00:24:42,365 --> 00:24:44,833
No, we won't do that.

286
00:24:46,269 --> 00:24:47,395
No?

287
00:24:48,671 --> 00:24:50,468
Okay. No.

288
00:24:54,210 --> 00:24:55,575
I said no.

289
00:25:10,293 --> 00:25:11,954
Where you going, bitch?

290
00:25:12,028 --> 00:25:14,792
You want me
to splatter you all over her, man?

291
00:25:21,704 --> 00:25:25,367
Give me a kidney, or I kill your friend.
Your choice.

292
00:25:27,310 --> 00:25:30,108
Let's do it. Scalpel's right there.

293
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:47,227
Use the geI at least twice a day
to help prevent scarring.

294
00:25:47,297 --> 00:25:50,562
Did the directions say,
"Apply from a remote beach in Bermuda"?

295
00:25:50,633 --> 00:25:53,295
No, that's to prevent
additionaI bullet holes.

296
00:25:56,639 --> 00:25:58,834
-I'm not going.
-Come on, Liz.

297
00:25:59,008 --> 00:26:01,875
You're getting that paid vacation
you've been begging for.

298
00:26:01,945 --> 00:26:03,674
I don't want a vacation.

299
00:26:03,746 --> 00:26:06,613
I wanna rip the skin
off of that tattooed piece of shit...

300
00:26:06,683 --> 00:26:08,651
and use it as wallpaper.

301
00:26:10,687 --> 00:26:13,520
You wouldn't be sending me away
if I was a man.

302
00:26:13,890 --> 00:26:17,348
You've seen how he treats women.
Like they're subhuman.

303
00:26:18,428 --> 00:26:21,397
That hasn't stopped me
from working with Christian.

304
00:26:22,832 --> 00:26:26,734
We'll be fine, Liz.
We'll call you when it's over.

305
00:26:28,471 --> 00:26:30,701
What if it's never over, Sean?

306
00:26:31,841 --> 00:26:34,537
Either way, you've taken
enough bullets for us.

307
00:26:34,978 --> 00:26:38,470
<i>This is the boarding announcement</i>
<i>for Flight 950 to Bermuda.</i>

308
00:26:38,648 --> 00:26:41,845
<i>Now boarding all rows.</i>
<i>Flight 950 to Bermuda.</i>

309
00:26:42,252 --> 00:26:46,382
Don't take this the wrong way,
but you're a better man than I am.

310
00:26:49,792 --> 00:26:51,282
Damn straight.

311
00:27:12,315 --> 00:27:15,011
Don't leave me out in the sun too long.

312
00:27:27,130 --> 00:27:30,463
We're in way over our heads.
We have to go to the police.

313
00:27:30,533 --> 00:27:33,525
We'll set up another meeting
with Escobar and call the cops.

314
00:27:33,603 --> 00:27:35,366
He'll have many warrants for his arrest.

315
00:27:35,438 --> 00:27:37,269
You think we'll just walk away from this?

316
00:27:37,340 --> 00:27:39,934
Shake hands with the cops
and say "Thanks for your help"?

317
00:27:40,009 --> 00:27:42,569
We're in this mess
because we're guilty, too.

318
00:27:42,979 --> 00:27:45,709
And putting Escobar in jail
isn't gonna stop it.

319
00:27:45,915 --> 00:27:49,612
We're gonna keep looking
over our shoulders as long as he's alive.

320
00:27:49,953 --> 00:27:52,683
Hey. You are not doing
anything like that, Sean.

321
00:27:52,755 --> 00:27:55,246
We're completely broke,
with no anesthesiologist...

322
00:27:55,325 --> 00:27:58,783
which means no more surgeries.
We're ruined, Christian.

323
00:27:59,562 --> 00:28:01,757
And now Julia and I are over.

324
00:28:03,132 --> 00:28:05,657
I see only one way left to fix this.

325
00:28:06,102 --> 00:28:08,229
We will find another way to fix it.

326
00:28:08,304 --> 00:28:10,670
You promise me
you'll be smart about this...

327
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:12,765
and don't do anything stupid.

328
00:28:12,842 --> 00:28:15,072
All we have is each other now.

329
00:28:23,453 --> 00:28:26,616
Don't come over here
and tell me Sean needs me...

330
00:28:26,689 --> 00:28:30,250
and then do exactly what he did,
and keep me in the dark.

331
00:28:30,326 --> 00:28:32,794
He's doing the best he can
to get us out of this...

332
00:28:32,862 --> 00:28:34,762
without anyone getting hurt.

333
00:28:34,831 --> 00:28:38,323
Does this have anything to do
with that man who came to our house?

334
00:28:38,401 --> 00:28:40,130
Jesus! He was here?

335
00:28:46,175 --> 00:28:50,339
We would have never gotten involved
with him if it weren't for me...

336
00:28:51,748 --> 00:28:55,240
but now we're obligated.

337
00:28:55,318 --> 00:28:58,310
-To do what?
-Surgeries.

338
00:29:02,258 --> 00:29:05,625
-Why didn't he tell me?
-Because he's trying to protect you.

339
00:29:06,062 --> 00:29:09,225
Like he's trying to protect me,
and our business.

340
00:29:10,133 --> 00:29:11,896
He's ashamed, Julia...

341
00:29:11,968 --> 00:29:14,960
that he's been reduced
to cleaning up my shit.

342
00:29:16,339 --> 00:29:20,173
Hoping that eventually
I will grow up and change.

343
00:29:21,344 --> 00:29:23,938
He's not the only one who hoped that.

344
00:29:30,753 --> 00:29:31,947
Look...

345
00:29:33,723 --> 00:29:36,351
I know there's unresolved stuff
between us...

346
00:29:36,426 --> 00:29:38,621
that might never work itself out...

347
00:29:40,830 --> 00:29:44,095
but if there's even a part of you
that's ever loved him...

348
00:29:44,901 --> 00:29:46,368
help him now.

349
00:29:48,805 --> 00:29:51,899
He's not gonna make it through this
without you.

350
00:30:14,263 --> 00:30:16,288
Where's your wedding ring?

351
00:30:25,074 --> 00:30:28,168
-What do you want for this?
-A gun.

352
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:46,320
Sean. What a surprise.

353
00:30:47,897 --> 00:30:50,024
-Where's Pepe?
-Airport.

354
00:30:51,401 --> 00:30:53,426
It's just you and me, Doc.

355
00:30:58,341 --> 00:31:00,241
You wanna give me a spot?

356
00:31:15,792 --> 00:31:17,123
Thank you.

357
00:31:27,236 --> 00:31:29,830
First one's always the hardest, Sean.

358
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:32,203
I remember my first.

359
00:31:33,709 --> 00:31:37,110
I was shaking like a little girl.

360
00:31:40,283 --> 00:31:42,251
But I didn't puke after.

361
00:31:44,454 --> 00:31:48,083
Most people, they puke after their first.

362
00:31:49,625 --> 00:31:52,025
I don't know what you're talking about.

363
00:31:53,496 --> 00:31:55,691
You're a desperate man, Sean.

364
00:31:58,201 --> 00:32:01,261
Desperate men don't come by to talk.

365
00:32:01,838 --> 00:32:03,396
They come by to kill.

366
00:32:11,747 --> 00:32:14,181
You gotta get better
at hiding your piece, man.

367
00:32:14,250 --> 00:32:17,583
It's sticking out of the back of your shirt
like a hard-on.

368
00:32:22,225 --> 00:32:23,249
So?

369
00:32:24,594 --> 00:32:25,925
Here I am.

370
00:32:36,405 --> 00:32:38,202
Show me what you got.

371
00:33:10,907 --> 00:33:12,875
You've tortured me, threatened me...

372
00:33:12,942 --> 00:33:16,343
made me do things
I never thought I'd be capable of doing.

373
00:33:16,612 --> 00:33:18,204
But I'm not you!

374
00:33:24,086 --> 00:33:25,986
You can't have my soul.

375
00:33:28,858 --> 00:33:30,621
Souls are overrated.

376
00:33:37,833 --> 00:33:40,666
Oh, shit. I love this song.

377
00:33:43,539 --> 00:33:44,938
Have a seat.

378
00:33:54,417 --> 00:33:56,544
You ever hear a song, and bam...

379
00:33:56,619 --> 00:33:59,816
you're right back where you were
when you first heard it?

380
00:34:03,059 --> 00:34:05,459
I was 23 when this song came out.

381
00:34:06,629 --> 00:34:08,426
The whole world in front of me.

382
00:34:08,497 --> 00:34:10,727
And look what you did with it.

383
00:34:11,033 --> 00:34:14,025
You know what I wanted to be
when I was a kid?

384
00:34:15,071 --> 00:34:16,868
Really. An actor.

385
00:34:18,641 --> 00:34:20,108
No shit, man.

386
00:34:21,310 --> 00:34:24,939
No, not some big star like,
you know, Banderas or Assante.

387
00:34:25,214 --> 00:34:29,446
Just one of those soap actors.
The ones my grandmother used to watch.

388
00:34:29,652 --> 00:34:32,086
Am I supposed to be sorry for you?

389
00:34:33,089 --> 00:34:35,284
I'm not looking for sympathy.

390
00:34:39,762 --> 00:34:41,787
I'm looking to the future.

391
00:34:43,399 --> 00:34:45,731
You ever think about a fresh start, Doc?

392
00:34:45,801 --> 00:34:47,666
You forced that on me.

393
00:34:48,804 --> 00:34:52,570
My wife left. My practice is in ruins.

394
00:34:54,810 --> 00:34:59,338
And all of that
gave you the nuts you never had.

395
00:35:01,884 --> 00:35:04,580
I gave you the balls...

396
00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:07,653
to come here with a gun.

397
00:35:10,826 --> 00:35:14,387
Now, you return my favor.

398
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,959
You do for me what you did
for that <i>cochino</i> Silvio Perez.

399
00:35:26,308 --> 00:35:28,037
Give me a new face.

400
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:32,705
Get rid of all this paint.

401
00:35:35,584 --> 00:35:38,018
This snake wants to shed its skin.

402
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:39,610
You're joking.

403
00:35:44,794 --> 00:35:47,024
You do it and you are free.

404
00:35:47,530 --> 00:35:51,159
You do it and you can have your life back.

405
00:35:52,802 --> 00:35:54,565
So you've been lD'd.

406
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:58,698
FBl?

407
00:35:59,942 --> 00:36:01,705
I can't go anywhere.

408
00:36:03,512 --> 00:36:06,845
I can't go home. I'm trapped!

409
00:36:08,818 --> 00:36:12,777
-How do I know you're not lying?
-Men like me don't need to lie.

410
00:36:17,426 --> 00:36:21,556
You make me
never have to see my face again...

411
00:36:23,733 --> 00:36:27,396
and you'll never have
to see it again, either.

412
00:36:46,589 --> 00:36:49,990
Sean, I've been trying to reach you all day.
I'm worried.

413
00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:52,550
Please call me.

414
00:36:55,531 --> 00:36:57,294
-Hey, asshole.
-What?

415
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:00,163
My water just broke.

416
00:37:40,910 --> 00:37:42,673
I want my ring back.

417
00:37:45,781 --> 00:37:47,681
I don't have it, Julia.

418
00:37:51,554 --> 00:37:55,046
I don't care. Come home.

419
00:38:12,775 --> 00:38:15,938
That's it. Good. That's good.
That's really good.

420
00:38:17,446 --> 00:38:21,314
Deep breath. Now, one more time.
Come on. Suck it up.

421
00:38:21,383 --> 00:38:23,112
Screw you, asshole!

422
00:38:23,385 --> 00:38:25,751
-Push one more time.
-Okay!

423
00:38:26,188 --> 00:38:29,885
All right. Good. Go. Here we go. Push.

424
00:38:31,894 --> 00:38:35,591
Here we go. He's crowning.
Yeah, here he comes. Come on.

425
00:38:37,867 --> 00:38:39,198
He's here.

426
00:39:47,436 --> 00:39:49,028
Hey, little guy.

427
00:39:57,012 --> 00:40:00,277
-Congratulations, Papa.
-Which one is he?

428
00:40:01,684 --> 00:40:04,118
He's the little guy in the middle.

429
00:40:06,956 --> 00:40:08,685
I don't understand.

430
00:40:11,593 --> 00:40:12,958
That's him.

431
00:40:16,131 --> 00:40:19,032
She said she doesn't remember
the encounter.

432
00:40:19,535 --> 00:40:21,400
You've heard of blackout drinking...

433
00:40:21,470 --> 00:40:25,668
this is what Sexaholics Anonymous
calls blackout sex.

434
00:40:28,177 --> 00:40:29,906
Do you believe her?

435
00:40:34,316 --> 00:40:35,977
I'm working on it.

436
00:40:36,885 --> 00:40:38,876
Like you guys are, right?

437
00:40:42,458 --> 00:40:44,323
What are you gonna do?

438
00:40:46,962 --> 00:40:50,056
I'm not gonna walk away
over dumb shit like DNA.

439
00:40:51,934 --> 00:40:55,267
I'm not gonna abandon him
because he doesn't look like me.

440
00:41:02,244 --> 00:41:04,735
I protected him before he was born.

441
00:41:06,482 --> 00:41:08,450
I put together his crib.

442
00:41:10,786 --> 00:41:12,185
I loved him.

443
00:41:14,857 --> 00:41:16,757
I can't just leave him.

444
00:41:20,929 --> 00:41:22,328
He's my son.

445
00:41:37,813 --> 00:41:41,544
-It kind of sucks, though.
-What?

446
00:41:43,118 --> 00:41:46,713
For years I've fantasized
about what it would be like to have...

447
00:41:48,457 --> 00:41:49,947
a reaI family.

448
00:41:52,828 --> 00:41:55,023
A guaranteed spot at the table.

449
00:42:01,870 --> 00:42:05,328
You've got that, Christian. With us.

450
00:42:06,675 --> 00:42:10,577
We're your family. And you're ours.

451
00:42:27,529 --> 00:42:30,225
"Area plastic surgeon sued
by dead dog's owner."

452
00:42:30,299 --> 00:42:32,995
-Sued for how much?
-$10 million.

453
00:42:33,902 --> 00:42:36,871
Even if he survives the lawsuit,
his reputation is in tatters.

454
00:42:36,939 --> 00:42:40,204
No wonder our appointment book
is filling up again.

455
00:42:46,782 --> 00:42:48,647
Ready for our consult?

456
00:42:49,585 --> 00:42:51,485
You think it will work?

457
00:42:52,754 --> 00:42:54,085
I hope so.

458
00:42:55,657 --> 00:42:57,750
Here's your current physicaI likeness...

459
00:42:57,826 --> 00:43:01,421
and here's what you'll look like
four months after surgery.

460
00:43:07,436 --> 00:43:10,234
-That look like an Armand to you?
-Armand?

461
00:43:10,672 --> 00:43:14,335
Yeah, that's the new name to go along
with my new face: Armand Ortiz.

462
00:43:14,409 --> 00:43:18,368
Sounds like it belongs
up on the silver screen, right, Dr. Sean?

463
00:43:20,382 --> 00:43:23,749
I don't like this face.
I'm better looking than this.

464
00:43:24,086 --> 00:43:27,988
Don't let vanity
rob you of your freedom, Mr. Ortiz.

465
00:43:36,565 --> 00:43:39,295
Pepe will be present during the surgery.

466
00:43:40,035 --> 00:43:44,631
lf you try and kill me during the operation,
he has orders to shoot to kill.

467
00:43:45,073 --> 00:43:46,836
We're not murderers.

468
00:43:47,476 --> 00:43:51,105
Plastic surgeons have
a bad enough image problem as it is.

469
00:43:57,085 --> 00:43:58,177
All right.

470
00:44:00,689 --> 00:44:02,179
Let's do this.

471
00:44:03,692 --> 00:44:05,785
We're gonna sedate you now.

472
00:44:24,780 --> 00:44:26,304
May I help you?

473
00:44:27,015 --> 00:44:29,449
I'm here for my paternity results.

474
00:44:29,518 --> 00:44:32,351
-Your number?
-2-4-8-X-T.

475
00:44:32,688 --> 00:44:34,019
Thank you.

476
00:44:44,733 --> 00:44:48,328
We've had your results
for over three months.

477
00:44:49,104 --> 00:44:52,733
We called the number you gave us,
but it was disconnected.

478
00:44:52,841 --> 00:44:56,402
I made up the number.
I didn't know if I was coming back.

479
00:44:57,779 --> 00:44:59,178
Why did you?

480
00:45:01,016 --> 00:45:03,780
I thought the answer
would change my life.

481
00:45:03,852 --> 00:45:07,117
Now I'm not sure that it has to,
or that it should.

482
00:45:10,959 --> 00:45:15,396
Just because you know
doesn't mean that anybody else has to.

483
00:45:25,807 --> 00:45:27,138
Thank you.

484
00:47:49,484 --> 00:47:52,749
Excuse me, sir.
Could you stop right there, please?

485
00:47:57,426 --> 00:47:58,984
ls there a problem?

486
00:47:59,060 --> 00:48:02,552
FBl, with lNS. On your knees.
Hands behind your head.

487
00:48:03,331 --> 00:48:05,697
Mr. Barco, you have the right
to remain silent.

488
00:48:05,767 --> 00:48:07,632
Boys, a mistake has been made here.

489
00:48:07,702 --> 00:48:11,900
My name is Armand. Armand Ortiz.
Check my passport.

490
00:48:12,174 --> 00:48:14,608
Mr. Barco, you have the right
to an attorney.

491
00:48:14,676 --> 00:48:16,268
Who's Mr. Barco?

492
00:48:16,445 --> 00:48:19,972
Mr. Barco, a word of advice.
Next time there's a warrant out...

493
00:48:20,048 --> 00:48:23,313
for your arrest for bank robbery
and murder of a federaI agent...

494
00:48:23,385 --> 00:48:25,615
do more than change your name.

495
00:48:26,655 --> 00:48:28,282
Change your face.

496
00:48:48,543 --> 00:48:51,444
Tell me what you don't like about yourself.

497
00:49:24,813 --> 00:49:25,802
Rip by Youyoup
