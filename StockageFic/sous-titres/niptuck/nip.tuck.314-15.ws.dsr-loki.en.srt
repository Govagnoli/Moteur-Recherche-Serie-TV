previously on nip/tuck...

2
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:01,810
julia's pregnant.

3
00:00:01,840 --> 00:00:02,620
what?

4
00:00:02,670 --> 00:00:04,440
it's your baby,sean.

5
00:00:04,570 --> 00:00:05,730
i know.

6
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:10,820
dear christian,being your wife would only strip me of my dignity and sense of self.

7
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:12,980
I never went to see you again.

8
00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:16,130
Why are you making me do this?

9
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:18,460
it's good,baby. Don't stop.

10
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:20,980
whoa. You've got a goddamn dick.

11
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:21,550
relax.

12
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:24,260
i don't like being screwed with,ok?

13
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:33,910
tell us what you don't like about yourself,ms. Peck.

14
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:35,350
may i start at the beginning?

15
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:37,350
whatever makes you feel most comfortable.

16
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:39,080
about three months ago,

17
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:42,160
i met a guy at this bar that i go to.

18
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:46,270
He really knew how to treat a girl... heas real sweet.

19
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:49,060
We went back to my place for a nightcap

20
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:51,470
and started fooling around

21
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:53,880
and everything was going great

22
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:57,740
until he realized i was a pre-op.

23
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:02,760
He threw me to the ground and he kicked me until my ribs broke.

24
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:08,250
And then he started punching me in the face and destroyed it.

25
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:10,010
And then when i got my face fixed...

26
00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:12,300
did a licensed plastic surgeon do this to you?

27
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:14,830
i'm pretty sure he had a license.

28
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:17,920
He was vietnamese,so i didn't understand him all that much.

29
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:19,900
But my friend told me about him.

30
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:22,590
He did her breasts,and they turned out ok.

31
00:01:22,610 --> 00:01:26,890
And,you know,he was cheap,and i didn't have much money.

32
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:29,360
I guess i got what i paid for.

33
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:32,140
I spent every penny that i had to get my face repaired.

34
00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:33,310
Insurance wouldn't cover anything.

35
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:36,750
They said that i brought this on myself.

36
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:38,390
And then i lost my bartending job

37
00:01:38,410 --> 00:01:40,870
because they said i was scaring off the customers.

38
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:44,620
we'll be happy to rebuild your face the way you want it,ms. Peck.

39
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:47,840
We have a long-term payment plan that might be your best option.

40
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:50,400
there's only one option,dr.Mcnamara.

41
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:52,370
You're going to do my operation for free.

42
00:01:52,390 --> 00:01:54,730
Or i'm going straight to the police.

43
00:01:56,590 --> 00:01:57,830
excuse me?

44
00:01:57,870 --> 00:02:01,460
that real sweet guy that beat me up,he's your son.

45
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:03,320
I'm sorry i can't be more ladylike about this.

46
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,600
you dare threaten us after what you did to matt?

47
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:07,280
i just want retribution for what he did to me.

48
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:10,040
and beating him to a pulp before pissing on him wasn't enough?

49
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:11,480
Call the police.

50
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:12,580
You can use my phone.

51
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:14,220
They already know someone jumped him.

52
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:16,650
Now i can tell them who to arrest.

53
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:19,860
excuse me,dr. Troy.

54
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:21,840
A package just arrived for you.

55
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:22,940
well,sign for it.

56
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:25,140
the package is bleeding.

57
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:32,120
no return address.

58
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:08,440
we need to check the serial numbers on these and cross-check them with our records.

59
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:11,930
you think they belong to one of our patients?

60
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:14,940
this one's got something in it.

61
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:08,260
beauty is a curse on the world

62
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,300
you were right.

63
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:21,360
These did belong to one of our patients.

64
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:24,480
They're kimber's.

every breast implant has a serial number in case of a recall or defect.

habeas corpus,christian.

70
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:28,860
We can't start an investigation when there's no evidence of any crime.

71
00:05:28,890 --> 00:05:30,660
since when is a bloody implant

72
00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:33,340
from a woman who's been missing for weeks not evidence of a crime?

73
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,570
well,how'd you know kimber didn't have them removed herself?

74
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:36,760
because she loved them.

75
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,410
They were the first thing i ever gave her.

76
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:40,400
Our first surgery together.

77
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:44,060
speaking of surgeries,what do you think of my face?

78
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:47,100
The surgeon who did agree to do it,did a pretty good job,don't you think?

79
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,000
don't throw that guilt shit at me,kit.

80
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:50,070
After what you put me through,

81
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:52,250
you're lucky i wasn't standing over you with a scalpel.

82
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:54,310
if i knew you were still stinging after being left of the altar...

83
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:56,430
this proves that i wasn't left.

84
00:05:56,450 --> 00:05:59,820
Somebody took her,and somebody's keeping her hostage.

85
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:02,010
And somebody forced her to write that note to me.

86
00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:03,410
well,that sounds like a hell of an effort.

87
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,040
Who would do that?

88
00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:06,560
quentin.

89
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:10,820
Look,he's always had it in for me.

90
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:14,930
Only a plastic surgeon would know about serial numbers on implants.

91
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:21,260
You know something?

92
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:25,140
we've been investigating quentin since your release.

93
00:06:25,170 --> 00:06:26,180
that's great. Then bring him in.

94
00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:28,980
we don't have anything solid yet. It's all just circumstantial.

95
00:06:29,010 --> 00:06:30,220
it didn't stop you from arresting me.

96
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:34,140
yes,and since then my superiors have kept me on a tight leash.

97
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:37,070
They don't want any more embarrassments.

98
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:40,350
look,if there's even a slight chance that kimber's alive

99
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:42,890
and quentin knows anything about it,

100
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:45,700
you have to bring him in for questioning.

101
00:06:56,630 --> 00:06:58,300
hey,matt.

102
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,250
What's going on?

103
00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:04,670
mom's sick. She's been throwing up all over the place.

104
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:07,110
I thought you might have a stash of that tamiflu around here.

105
00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:09,100
i have some at the office.

106
00:07:09,130 --> 00:07:11,290
I can take it over in the morning.

107
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:16,410
How's your girlfriend?

108
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:18,480
we broke up.

109
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:25,580
a friend of yours dropped by the office today.

110
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:28,950
Cherry peck.

111
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:31,920
what did she want?

112
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:35,180
she wanted us to give her a facial reconstruction for free.

113
00:07:35,210 --> 00:07:38,540
I told her i would call the police if i ever saw her again.

114
00:07:40,170 --> 00:07:44,180
is her face still messed up from what happened?

115
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:48,070
she had reconstructive surgery already.

116
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:51,170
All she could afford was some strip mall hack.

117
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:53,180
so she still a complete mess.

118
00:07:53,210 --> 00:07:54,280
it doesn't matter.

119
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:56,740
She tried to blackmail us.

120
00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:04,490
Her cheek implants are too large.

121
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:06,250
There's some scarring on her forehead.

122
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:09,010
She needs to reset her nose.

123
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:21,270
i want you to fix her face,dad.

124
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:24,830
If someone doesn't,then she'll always look like a monster because of me.

125
00:08:24,850 --> 00:08:26,340
she and her friends jumped you,matt.

126
00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:27,480
She is a monster.

127
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:32,230
look,i know i shouldn't expect much from you.

128
00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:35,850
I haven't exactly been a model son lately.

129
00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:42,490
But i made a mistake.

130
00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:49,410
And you're the only one who can completely help me correct it.

131
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,560
It would mean a lot to me.

132
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:06,400
you look terrible.

133
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,860
Has the morning sickness been that bad?

134
00:09:07,890 --> 00:09:10,650
i haven't been able to keep anything down.

135
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:16,520
well,i brought you some b6 supplements,some crackers,ginger ale.

136
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:19,360
Try and stay away from anything spicy,rich,or fried.

137
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,980
Like french fries or chocolate or...

138
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:23,950
sorry. Just drink lots of fluids.

139
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:25,830
That's going to help the most. And rest.

140
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:27,480
There is an upside though.

141
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,540
Some doctors have seen a correlation

142
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:32,720
between miscarriages and a lack of having morning sickness.

143
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:36,690
So,in that regard,your vomiting is good.

144
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:38,520
Why are you dressed?

145
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:40,260
You're not going to work,are you?

146
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:42,020
of course i am. The spa is full.

147
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,850
And i have to take care of my patients.

148
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:45,720
well,you're just going to have to get someone to cover.

149
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:48,470
lots of women work while they're pregnant,sean.

150
00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:52,380
I was still taking a full load of classes when i was carrying matt,remember?

151
00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:54,300
yes. But you were 22,julia.

152
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:58,460
A baby born to a woman over 40 has at least one in a hundred chance of downs.

153
00:09:58,490 --> 00:10:02,430
And the odds of developing any kind of chromosomal abnormalities are even worse.

154
00:10:02,450 --> 00:10:03,990
Now,we won't have to worry about

155
00:10:04,010 --> 00:10:07,730
that once we get the results of the cvs which i've scheduled for thursday with dr. Fitzer.

156
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,480
fitzer's not my o. b.

157
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:10,680
if were going to make this work,

158
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,440
you're going to have to let me help you,julia.

159
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:14,590
Do things for you.

160
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:19,990
That's why i think you should move back into the house.

161
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:24,070
i'm not moving back into the the house,sean.

162
00:10:24,110 --> 00:10:29,790
I mean this baby isn't some puzzle piece that's been missing from our relationship.

163
00:10:39,530 --> 00:10:45,060
I've never misled you into thinking we were going back to what we had,sean.

164
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:56,210
the last time i saw you,my tongue was in your mouth.

165
00:10:56,230 --> 00:10:59,100
Certainly much more pleasant than this.

166
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:02,070
Am i under arrest for something?

167
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:05,180
i wanted to have a little chat with you about kimber.

168
00:11:05,210 --> 00:11:06,870
kimber?

169
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,750
Well,last i heard,she dumped christian at the altar.

170
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:12,570
Smartest move she ever made if you ask me.

171
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,290
she's missing.

172
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,610
And i think you have something to do with it.

173
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:17,850
you're joking?

174
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:20,970
I couldn't have spent a long weekend with that mental midget.

175
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:25,090
I like women whose iqs are higher than their waist size.

176
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,870
really? I thought you liked her.

177
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:30,940
Had a thing for her movies if i recall.

178
00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:34,530
i'm familiar with her catalog,so?

179
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:36,600
So are hundreds of thousands of other guys.

180
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:38,270
what about rhea reynolds?

181
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,380
You and christian were the only ones who knew she was a...

182
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:42,440
what did you call her,a fraud?

183
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:46,120
It must have felt good to put her through a surgery without proper anesthetic.

184
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:48,300
that was liz's fault. Her numbers were off.

185
00:11:48,330 --> 00:11:50,610
i know you don't have an alibi for the night that rhea was killed

186
00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:54,020
or for the night you raped and carved me.

187
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:56,830
now why would i rape you?

188
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:01,220
You were perfectly willing to spread your legs like a romanian gymnast for me.

189
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:04,800
rape isn't about sex,quentin. It's about power.

190
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:07,610
And you felt like you'd lost it after i arrested christian

191
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:11,230
and risked giving him all the glory for your butchery.

192
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:14,710
so i'm the carver now?

193
00:12:15,050 --> 00:12:18,290
Kit,if you want to catch this guy,

194
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,930
may i recommend that you expand the scope of your suspects

195
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:27,140
beyond those who know whether you're shaved,waxed,or natural?

196
00:12:27,170 --> 00:12:29,660
you neglected to use a condom when you raped me.

197
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:31,420
Thanks to your sloppiness,

198
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:35,400
we now have a sample of the carver's semen on file.

199
00:12:35,490 --> 00:12:36,890
When i match it with your dna,

200
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:38,500
you won't be smiling anymore.

201
00:12:38,530 --> 00:12:41,130
i hope you collect my dna yourself,kit.

202
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:43,700
Oh,god. I'm so turned on right now.

203
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:45,770
- where's kimber?
- i have no idea.

204
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:46,500
I'd check your ass,

205
00:12:46,530 --> 00:12:49,700
but you're so full of shit i don't think there would be any room for her up there.

206
00:12:49,730 --> 00:12:52,830
i've issued a warrant with judge nixon.

207
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:56,330
When he approves it,you'll be forced to give us a dna sample.

208
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:58,240
you want me to jerk off right now?

209
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:00,380
i'm going to do this all by the book.

210
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:02,570
When i bring you down,

211
00:13:02,610 --> 00:13:05,320
this case is going to be tighter than a vestal virgin.

212
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,640
heh. Well,tread lightly,kit.

213
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:09,620
You've already botched this case once.

214
00:13:09,650 --> 00:13:11,820
Another false arrest and you'll be back in london

215
00:13:11,850 --> 00:13:15,870
writing tickets to people for not picking up their dog shit.

216
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:51,090
you need to get him to talk.

217
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:52,780
no,i don't.

218
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:56,200
Kimber's been found.

219
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,310
how is she?

220
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:26,700
an fhp officer found her naked wandering along alligator alley.

221
00:14:26,730 --> 00:14:30,810
For some reason,yesterday he drove her out into the everglades and tossed her out.

222
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:32,170
can i see her?

223
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:32,990
not yet.

224
00:14:33,010 --> 00:14:34,300
bullshit. She's my fiancee.

225
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:37,310
she doesn't want to see you,christian.

226
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:42,480
She doesn't want you to see her.

227
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:51,400
tell me what he did to her.

228
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:55,680
the breast implants were the least of his butchery.

229
00:14:55,710 --> 00:14:58,030
He reversed every surgery you gave her.

230
00:14:58,060 --> 00:15:00,380
Without anesthetic.

231
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:01,490
reversed?

232
00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:07,540
I must've given her at least 10 procedures over the last few years.

233
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:19,800
Tell me what he did to her.

234
00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:24,660
after giving her the carver grin,

235
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:29,610
he removed the segment of rib cartilage you used to fix her nose.

236
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:34,830
Then he sucked the collagen from her lips

237
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:39,090
by removing a large portion of the saturated tissue.

238
00:15:49,530 --> 00:15:54,260
At some point,he also burned her skin to recreate the sun damage you repaired.

239
00:15:58,990 --> 00:16:02,940
Then he pumped rotten chicken fat into her midsection.

240
00:16:03,070 --> 00:16:05,140
Antl-lipo.

241
00:16:07,310 --> 00:16:10,840
It caused a pretty horrible infection that he didn't treat.

242
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:14,490
He removed her breasts as a final act of psychotic brutality.

243
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:26,880
i need to see her. I need to...

244
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:30,580
tell her i can fix everything that animal did to her.

245
00:16:30,610 --> 00:16:34,400
kimber identified herself by how she looked,christian.

246
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,370
She's barely holding it together as it is.

247
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,750
Seeing you could send her over the edge.

248
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:39,610
or bring her back from it.

249
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:40,700
well,i can't risk that.

250
00:16:40,730 --> 00:16:42,840
Kimber is the best witness we have right now.

251
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:45,330
If she transgresses into shock and can't give us any more information,

252
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:48,560
everything's she's been through will have been in vain.

253
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:03,350
dr. Mcnamara?

254
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:07,030
I wanted to thank you for reconsidering.

255
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:10,650
I think it's the right decision for all of us.

256
00:17:10,690 --> 00:17:15,030
i'm not doing this surgery as a response to your threat of extortion,ms. Peck.

257
00:17:15,070 --> 00:17:17,170
then why are you doing it?

258
00:17:17,210 --> 00:17:19,780
because my son asked me to.

259
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:23,600
Matt seemed to think we've all suffered enough for what's happened.

260
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:30,250
We need to rebuild instead of allowing our past to haunt us any longer.

261
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:37,970
Count backwards from 10.

262
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:27,690
don't worry,i'm here.

263
00:18:27,730 --> 00:18:30,030
It's all going to be ok.

264
00:18:32,330 --> 00:18:33,840
Relax,julia.

265
00:18:33,890 --> 00:18:36,390
Close your eyes and just relax.

266
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:39,760
This might be your last chance to get pregnant.

267
00:18:48,890 --> 00:18:51,310
stop it. It hurts.

268
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:53,350
skin is very elastic.It will heal.

269
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:55,540
You are like a 20-year-old,after all.

270
00:18:55,590 --> 00:18:57,030
Aren't you?

271
00:18:57,050 --> 00:18:59,640
why is that ticking so loud?

272
00:18:59,690 --> 00:19:01,630
Turn it off.

273
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:08,150
you don't want to turn off your biological clock just yet,julia.

274
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:10,800
I'm coming.

275
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:13,750
I'm coming.

276
00:19:20,010 --> 00:19:23,020
By the way,you need a face lift if you're going to do this.

277
00:19:23,050 --> 00:19:25,530
Otherwise,everyone will think you're the grandmother.

278
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:30,330
We'll start by removing these bags under your eyes...

279
00:19:35,650 --> 00:19:38,660
then we'll pull back your forehead.

280
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:41,680
Oh,forget it. It's too late.

281
00:19:41,710 --> 00:19:43,530
Your water broke.

282
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:56,470
no.

283
00:19:56,690 --> 00:19:58,300
put this on.

284
00:19:58,350 --> 00:20:00,480
You're late for surgery.

285
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,480
we can fix it.

286
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:19,330
No one will ever know what she's done.

287
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:36,520
what have you done to my baby?

288
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:46,750
we had to do a little work,that's all.

289
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:50,880
he have to make him respectable,julia.

290
00:21:02,990 --> 00:21:05,320
you did a wonderful job,julia.

291
00:21:05,370 --> 00:21:07,560
He's almost human.

292
00:21:11,790 --> 00:21:15,130
so irresponsible,having a baby at 40.

293
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:19,950
we did the best we could to repair your work,sweetheart.

294
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:25,890
what did you do to my baby?

295
00:21:59,330 --> 00:22:02,740
Hi. It's... i'm julia mcnamara.

296
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:06,960
I'd like to make an appointment with dr. Allenby as soon as possible.

297
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:16,320
i'm sorry,christian.

298
00:22:16,390 --> 00:22:20,220
I'm just sorry.

299
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:25,880
i should've known she wouldn't leave me like that.

300
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:29,380
Kimber loved me.

301
00:22:30,550 --> 00:22:32,530
this isn't your fault.

302
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:35,320
And blaming yourself isn't going to do her any good.

303
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:37,540
i just want to see her,you know?

304
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:51,550
hi. I'm dr. Sean mcnamara.

305
00:22:51,590 --> 00:22:52,620
I'm a plastic surgeon.

306
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:56,110
I just wanna give you one of my cards.

307
00:22:56,150 --> 00:22:57,130
what for?

308
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:58,260
nothing.

309
00:22:58,310 --> 00:23:01,070
I just thought you might want to have that wattle taken care of.

310
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:03,310
You have a great profile.

311
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:16,740
who's there?

312
00:23:17,710 --> 00:23:19,850
it's me,sweetheart.

313
00:23:22,990 --> 00:23:24,540
The guard wouldn't let me in.

314
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:29,700
So sean had to bribe...

315
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:32,390
is there anything special i can bring you,sweetheart?

316
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:34,070
go away.

317
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:41,030
please don't say that.

318
00:23:41,070 --> 00:23:42,770
I've missed you so much.

319
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:45,940
why didn't you come looking for me?

320
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:52,460
i thought you'd left me.

321
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,830
I thought you'd come to your senses.

322
00:23:55,930 --> 00:23:58,080
you left me to die.

323
00:23:58,950 --> 00:24:01,890
You let him do this to me.

324
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:06,610
kimber,please.

325
00:24:08,870 --> 00:24:10,580
Don't blame me for this.

326
00:24:10,630 --> 00:24:15,160
he wouldn't have hurt me if you hadn't given me all those surgeries.

327
00:24:16,390 --> 00:24:21,400
You made me think that i needed them for you to love me.

328
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:25,710
It's true.

329
00:24:27,050 --> 00:24:30,840
Beauty is a curse on the world.

330
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:33,020
please don't. Please.

331
00:24:34,150 --> 00:24:40,240
Please don't let him poison everything we have with each other.

332
00:24:42,270 --> 00:24:43,330
I want us to start fresh.

333
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:49,240
I want to rebuild our lives together.

334
00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:52,470
you won't want me anymore.

335
00:24:52,510 --> 00:24:55,000
I'm a monster.

336
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:09,090
On our first date,

337
00:25:09,510 --> 00:25:13,410
you said that i was an 8.

338
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:16,470
you were honest with me.

339
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:22,860
I need you to tell me what i am now,

340
00:25:22,890 --> 00:25:26,670
as honestly as you did then.

341
00:25:27,210 --> 00:25:30,320
From 1 to 10.

342
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:16,690
i'll make you a 10 again,sweetheart,i promise you.

343
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:19,670
I'll make you a 10 again.

344
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:31,400
i'm glad you decided to do a cvs test.

345
00:26:31,430 --> 00:26:34,440
I'm a big believer and the sooner we know of any abnormalities,

346
00:26:34,470 --> 00:26:37,050
the sooner we can prepare ourselves on how to deal with them.

347
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:40,540
i don't like to be superstitious about these things,

348
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:44,580
but,you know,with my age and 2 healthy kids,

349
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:47,860
i just feel like this baby is tempting god a little.

350
00:26:47,890 --> 00:26:49,380
that's why we're here,julia.

351
00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:51,730
To remove the unknown.

352
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:54,820
And we're still in the first trimester.

353
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:56,250
We have time.

354
00:26:57,900 --> 00:27:02,500
Now i'm going to do an ultrasound to help guide the catheter through your cervix.

355
00:27:02,550 --> 00:27:04,930
You know,we can video the ultrasound if you like.

356
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:07,810
i'd like a video,if that's ok?

357
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:09,530
let me grab a blank dvd.

358
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:12,200
I'll just be a second.

359
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:25,410
look,sean,i know i was hard on you the other day,but...

360
00:27:25,590 --> 00:27:28,550
you do have a role in all of this,

361
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:31,290
and i'm gonna respect that.

362
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:38,870
Thanks for coming.

363
00:27:40,550 --> 00:27:44,920
this baby's gonna grow up and be strong and healthy,julia.

364
00:27:56,250 --> 00:27:58,640
how are matt and annie?

365
00:27:58,670 --> 00:28:00,380
I haven't seen them in forever.

366
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:01,400
they're fine.

367
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:06,110
Matt's a senior and annie's gonna start middle school next year.

368
00:28:06,150 --> 00:28:08,280
they're growing up too fast.

369
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:10,910
i know exactly what you mean.

370
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:17,230
I feel like i have missed jessica's entire childhood.

371
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:19,530
I mean,what with work and sharing custody...

372
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:21,010
take a breath...

373
00:28:21,090 --> 00:28:24,460
we only see each other when i'm driving her to her father's house.

374
00:28:25,130 --> 00:28:31,520
Another reason why it's so nice to see you two back together.

375
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:42,420
ok. Everything's good so far.

376
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:49,150
Now... you're gonna feel a little prick when i insert the needle.

377
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:55,100
Does that feel all right,julia?

378
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:56,310
yeah.

379
00:29:18,130 --> 00:29:20,070
oh,my god.

380
00:29:21,350 --> 00:29:23,050
Oh,jeez.

381
00:29:27,630 --> 00:29:29,980
- how are we doing,sweetheart?
- i gotta get out of here.

382
00:29:30,010 --> 00:29:32,880
I can't... all these tools,

383
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:34,800
it's taking me back to that place.

384
00:29:34,820 --> 00:29:36,850
you're having a post-traumatic stress reaction.

385
00:29:36,890 --> 00:29:40,550
It's normal for somebody who's suffered the kind of trauma you've been through.

386
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,170
Ok? You're gonna be fine.I promise.

387
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:47,860
Can we get her 10 ccs of versed.

388
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:56,190
I'm gonna take good care of you from now on.

389
00:29:56,490 --> 00:30:00,790
Now,are you sure you want to do all the surgeries at once?

390
00:30:00,830 --> 00:30:03,630
The recovery is gonna be much less traumatic if we do them one at a time.

391
00:30:03,650 --> 00:30:06,600
no. I need you to fix everything.

392
00:30:06,780 --> 00:30:10,330
I don't want to wait to be who i was.

393
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:14,960
i'll be right here when you wake up,ok?

394
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:17,060
ok.

395
00:30:21,670 --> 00:30:24,010
Wait. Wait,christian.

396
00:30:28,710 --> 00:30:32,540
Will you stay here until i fall asleep?

397
00:30:33,470 --> 00:30:35,380
of course.

398
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:17,690
keep applying this for the next 2 weeks.

399
00:32:17,710 --> 00:32:20,460
It'll help your skin heal faster.

400
00:32:20,540 --> 00:32:23,660
i just want to tell you how much i appreciate this.

401
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:28,250
you want to see how it looks?

402
00:32:35,330 --> 00:32:37,320
i'm beautiful.

403
00:32:39,630 --> 00:32:41,090
hi.

404
00:32:44,810 --> 00:32:48,790
You look really good,cherry.

405
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:57,900
did your father do your face,too?

406
00:32:58,390 --> 00:32:59,960
Yeah.

407
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:04,050
you did a fantastic job,dr. Mcnamara.

408
00:33:05,210 --> 00:33:07,420
yeah,i did.

409
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:12,740
Well,i'll leave you two alone.

410
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:16,740
i don't think he finished putting that stuff on.

411
00:33:16,770 --> 00:33:19,770
oh,here. I got it.

412
00:33:31,550 --> 00:33:38,870
You know,i just wanted to say that...

413
00:33:41,010 --> 00:33:44,210
you know,i really wasn't...

414
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:47,350
did you really tell your father to do my surgery?

415
00:33:47,380 --> 00:33:48,660
yeah.

416
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:54,920
i'm sorry,too,matt,for what we did to you.

417
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:57,390
Although you did kind of deserve it.

418
00:33:57,430 --> 00:33:58,500
yeah.

419
00:33:58,980 --> 00:34:01,130
you really think i look good?

420
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:03,910
yeah,you know? Sure.

421
00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:09,910
i'm planning on having my reassignment surgery sometime next year.

422
00:34:09,940 --> 00:34:12,250
Been taking all the hormones.

423
00:34:12,290 --> 00:34:14,960
that's great,cherry,

424
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:18,660
but i don't think that...

425
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:20,210
it's ok.

426
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:25,310
It's just hard not to hit on a guy as cute as you.

427
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:27,710
thank you.

428
00:34:29,140 --> 00:34:30,630
look at me.

429
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:33,250
I'm gonna need some new makeup.

430
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:36,350
a girl's gotta look her best,you know?

431
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:39,660
what? This gooey stuff isn't what you had in mind?

432
00:34:39,690 --> 00:34:42,140
- no.
- really?

433
00:35:06,330 --> 00:35:08,470
drop your pants,quentin.

434
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:09,750
you first.

435
00:35:09,790 --> 00:35:12,730
the scope of judge nixon's warrant is very broad,per my request.

436
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:14,140
If you don't provide us with everything we need,

437
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:15,250
i'll be happy to arrest you.

438
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:16,870
then arrest me.

439
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:20,350
You're not gonna find anything to connect me to those carvings.

440
00:35:20,380 --> 00:35:21,560
I'm an innocent man.

441
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:23,890
i'll be the judge of that.

442
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:26,470
Now drop your pants.

443
00:35:30,570 --> 00:35:32,150
You've nothing to be ashamed of.

444
00:35:32,170 --> 00:35:34,990
I've had you inside me,remember?

445
00:35:35,270 --> 00:35:37,700
Right before you carved my face.

446
00:35:37,730 --> 00:35:40,400
I rarely forget a dick,

447
00:35:40,750 --> 00:35:42,360
particularly if it's raping me.

448
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:43,860
if we had sex,

449
00:35:43,890 --> 00:35:45,900
you'd remember me.

450
00:35:45,950 --> 00:35:47,880
prove it.

451
00:36:45,350 --> 00:36:47,040
hey,baby.

452
00:36:52,390 --> 00:36:54,420
How did it go?

453
00:36:54,740 --> 00:36:56,850
it went perfectly.

454
00:36:56,900 --> 00:36:58,830
You were amazing.

455
00:37:01,830 --> 00:37:03,530
Let me get you a mirror so you take a look at yourself.

456
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:07,530
no,no,no. I don't want any mirrors.

457
00:37:12,850 --> 00:37:17,490
i understand. You want to wait until the healing process is further along.

458
00:37:17,510 --> 00:37:20,130
uh-uh. No.

459
00:37:20,250 --> 00:37:23,080
I don't want any mirrors ever.

460
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:24,570
I had you fix me

461
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:30,410
so the rest of the world could see me and not run screaming.

462
00:37:32,140 --> 00:37:36,940
I'll never be able to look at myself and not see the pain.

463
00:37:36,970 --> 00:37:37,860
don't say that,sweetheart.

464
00:37:37,890 --> 00:37:40,220
We're gonna get through all of this together.

465
00:37:40,330 --> 00:37:43,160
And as soon as you've healed,we'll reschedule the wedding.

466
00:37:43,180 --> 00:37:44,480
wedding?

467
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:46,510
What are you talking about?

468
00:37:46,540 --> 00:37:49,550
i'm talking about not letting this monster take everything away from us.

469
00:37:49,570 --> 00:37:52,950
but he already took everything away from me.

470
00:37:52,950 --> 00:37:54,940
I can't do this anymore,christian.

471
00:37:54,970 --> 00:38:01,520
I can't be this beautiful couple that spends $600 a month on tanning salons,

472
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:05,750
who takes an hour to get ready just to go to the gym,

473
00:38:05,780 --> 00:38:11,900
who measure people's worth by their body fat percentage.

474
00:38:16,710 --> 00:38:19,000
this is perfectly normal.

475
00:38:19,450 --> 00:38:21,700
It's called stockholm syndrome.

476
00:38:21,730 --> 00:38:24,230
Kidnapping victims sympathize with their captors.

477
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:26,740
It's a survival strategy.

478
00:38:28,570 --> 00:38:31,470
he wasn't my captor.

479
00:38:31,770 --> 00:38:34,020
You were.

480
00:38:34,090 --> 00:38:36,760
Porn was.

481
00:38:36,870 --> 00:38:42,560
He was just the man holding up the mirror to our beautiful,superficial lives,

482
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:46,790
showing me how grotesque they were.

483
00:38:46,830 --> 00:38:51,360
It's just ugliness hidden by a perfect mask.

484
00:38:53,570 --> 00:38:56,090
How am i supposed to be with you

485
00:38:56,120 --> 00:39:01,770
when your job is to give everybody those masks?

486
00:39:02,710 --> 00:39:05,570
I'll give it all up. We can...

487
00:39:05,660 --> 00:39:09,250
...go off and take care of lepers for all i care.

488
00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:16,140
I need to be with you,kimber.

489
00:39:18,290 --> 00:39:21,090
i know,baby.

490
00:39:23,730 --> 00:39:27,440
But i need to not be with you.

491
00:39:52,310 --> 00:39:54,430
what do you think of this one?

492
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:58,330
it's a little pale.

493
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:00,240
you're right.

494
00:40:00,370 --> 00:40:03,110
I'm a spring,and this makes me look like a winter.

495
00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:06,060
Maybe this one. There's a little more red in it.

496
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:07,340
can i help you?

497
00:40:07,370 --> 00:40:08,680
yes,hi.

498
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:11,290
What's your opinion on this foundation?

499
00:40:11,310 --> 00:40:13,420
well,it's hypoallergenic.

500
00:40:13,460 --> 00:40:16,380
But it won't look good if you apply it that thick,honey.

501
00:40:16,420 --> 00:40:17,660
i'm recovering from surgery.

502
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:19,610
I don't want the scars to show through.

503
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:21,210
this isn't a drugstore.

504
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:23,090
This product is very expensive.

505
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:25,660
Were you actually planning on purchasing a bottle

506
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:27,670
or just tainting all our samples.

507
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:28,730
what's your problem,lady?

508
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:30,250
You treat all your customers like shit?

509
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:33,750
he is not a customer until he buys something.

510
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:35,720
I get your kind in here all the time.

511
00:40:35,740 --> 00:40:37,120
They never buy a damn thing.

512
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:40,210
and we're gonna buy something from you now?

513
00:40:40,310 --> 00:40:43,530
Look,my friend was nothing but polite to you,

514
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:45,400
and you treat her like she's a hooker?

515
00:40:45,430 --> 00:40:46,640
Let me tell you something.

516
00:40:46,670 --> 00:40:50,120
She's more of a lady than you will ever be.

517
00:40:55,010 --> 00:40:57,040
you didn't have to do that.

518
00:40:58,860 --> 00:41:01,730
hey,you don't deserve that bullshit.

519
00:41:02,530 --> 00:41:04,430
but i'm used to it.

520
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:07,780
here. Try this.

521
00:41:07,830 --> 00:41:08,810
What is that?

522
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:13,480
well,isn't this a beautiful sight?

523
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:15,290
It must be ladies night.

524
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:17,610
Try the bronzer,sweetie.You really need it.

525
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:21,680
they don't sell nazi paraphernalia and jackboots in this section,ariel.

526
00:41:21,710 --> 00:41:22,830
Get lost.

527
00:41:22,860 --> 00:41:24,360
and miss this hallmark moment?

528
00:41:24,390 --> 00:41:26,230
Not a chance.

529
00:41:26,430 --> 00:41:28,410
so,tranny,

530
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:30,870
isn't matt fantastic in bed?

531
00:41:30,910 --> 00:41:32,670
Do you squeal with pleasure when he goes down on you?

532
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:35,940
Because,you know,i always knew that he really liked dick.

533
00:41:35,970 --> 00:41:37,150
i'm not with matt.

534
00:41:37,170 --> 00:41:38,760
He's my friend.

535
00:41:39,030 --> 00:41:41,900
you know you really beautiful,Ariel

536
00:41:41,940 --> 00:41:44,620
i almost too sorry for you

537
00:41:44,660 --> 00:41:47,950
i'm not the one dating a dude and a skirt,matt

538
00:41:47,980 --> 00:41:50,440
which cleverance school hear about this

539
00:41:50,460 --> 00:41:52,850
you won't make it out of life

540
00:41:54,660 --> 00:41:56,980
I shouldn't asked you to come

541
00:41:58,570 --> 00:42:00,500
No,it's cool

542
00:42:00,550 --> 00:42:04,690
She is a whack job ,no body believe word she said anyway

543
00:42:24,540 --> 00:42:27,390
you steal  stash stuff up there

544
00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:30,680
for special occasions

545
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:35,620
or One of us really need to get shit-faced

546
00:42:35,660 --> 00:42:37,740
so we drinking to

547
00:42:38,030 --> 00:42:40,350
heartache,regret

548
00:42:43,940 --> 00:42:45,940
To our profession

549
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:49,940
The only field medcine of dedicated  to both fixing what is broken

550
00:42:49,970 --> 00:42:52,960
and rebuilding the unrepairable

551
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:58,820
and To my new son or daughter

552
00:43:02,060 --> 00:43:04,390
Julia

553
00:43:08,980 --> 00:43:11,160
You shit me

554
00:43:17,740 --> 00:43:21,520
I didn't even know you guys were sleeping together

555
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:24,090
It only takes one time

556
00:43:26,430 --> 00:43:28,850
We're not getting back together or anything like that

557
00:43:28,890 --> 00:43:32,130
we have committed to work together

558
00:43:32,210 --> 00:43:35,110
trying not to screw it up too bad this time

559
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:37,160
although I supposed

560
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:41,500
the child we have from her and my gene pool turned out pretty well.

561
00:43:43,650 --> 00:43:45,590
You see,christian,

562
00:43:45,620 --> 00:43:49,130
no matter how shattered a relationship is,

563
00:43:49,270 --> 00:43:51,440
as long as there's love,

564
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:55,080
there's always the hope of putting it back together.

565
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:00,430
hello,boys.

566
00:44:01,810 --> 00:44:03,620
I was hoping to find kimber here.

567
00:44:03,650 --> 00:44:05,580
she went and checked into de la mer.

568
00:44:05,650 --> 00:44:08,180
So,have you arrested quentin yet?

569
00:44:08,470 --> 00:44:10,400
to the contrary.

570
00:44:10,870 --> 00:44:12,350
We had to let him go.

571
00:44:12,370 --> 00:44:16,940
We came across some new evidence that rules him out as a suspect.

572
00:44:18,290 --> 00:44:21,780
what could counteract the mountain of evidence against him?

573
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:29,470
take a look for yourselves.

574
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:48,470
holy shit. Is this for real?

575
00:44:48,500 --> 00:44:50,590
completely.

576
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:57,120
As you see,quentin can't be the person that raped me or left a semen sample behind.

577
00:44:58,850 --> 00:45:01,450
He has no penis.

580
00:45:30,590 --> 00:45:31,470
what are you doing here?

581
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:33,310
we were called by the girl's mother.

582
00:45:33,340 --> 00:45:34,860
she's a very important client of ours.

583
00:45:34,860 --> 00:45:37,140
She's asked us to transfer her daughter to our office.

584
00:45:37,160 --> 00:45:39,500
we have a private ambulance out front.

585
00:45:42,340 --> 00:45:43,480
which girl?

586
00:45:43,510 --> 00:45:44,330
what do you mean,which girl?

587
00:45:44,350 --> 00:45:45,930
The one who was attacked by the carver.

588
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:48,090
you're going to have to be a little bit more specific.

589
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:50,220
I have 9 victims.

590
00:46:03,890 --> 00:46:06,150
he attacked all these girls tonight?

591
00:46:06,190 --> 00:46:09,130
picked them off one by one.

592
00:46:09,210 --> 00:46:10,940
Believe it or not,this is a good thing.

593
00:46:10,970 --> 00:46:13,330
i think you're becoming desensitized,kit.

594
00:46:13,370 --> 00:46:15,870
serial criminals like the carver are creatures of habit.

595
00:46:15,890 --> 00:46:17,850
They're obsessive-compulsive.

596
00:46:18,010 --> 00:46:20,990
When they break protocol like this,it means they're getting desperate.

597
00:46:21,020 --> 00:46:22,860
That's when we catch them.

598
00:46:23,260 --> 00:46:25,780
It's always darkest before the dawn.

599
00:46:25,840 --> 00:46:27,890
where's chelsey myers?

600
00:46:30,180 --> 00:46:31,830
Why don't you go talk to chelsey?

601
00:46:31,850 --> 00:46:34,710
I'm going to see if i can help any of these other girls.

602
00:46:49,120 --> 00:46:50,690
chelsey?

603
00:46:53,380 --> 00:46:57,980
Chelsey,my name is dr.Christian troy. I'm a plastic surgeon.

604
00:46:58,010 --> 00:47:01,720
Your mom called me and asked me to come down here and take care of you.

605
00:47:01,740 --> 00:47:03,910
She's gonna meet us at my office.

606
00:47:03,940 --> 00:47:06,590
She's not allowed in here right now

607
00:47:07,210 --> 00:47:09,140
my mom is here?

608
00:47:12,130 --> 00:47:15,180
i'm gonna take good care of you,sweetheart,ok?

609
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:17,300
She's in shock.

610
00:47:18,190 --> 00:47:21,370
i'd like to take a couple of these girls back to the office for surgery.

611
00:47:21,390 --> 00:47:23,840
It'll be a late night,but maybe we can do them to back.

612
00:47:23,870 --> 00:47:24,530
ok.

613
00:47:24,560 --> 00:47:28,360
chelsey,can you tell me anything you remember about the man who attacked you?

614
00:47:28,390 --> 00:47:31,240
- Kit,now's not the time
- it's the best time,christian.

615
00:47:31,270 --> 00:47:32,950
We have to catch this man as soon as possible.

616
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:36,990
This is going to look like a disney movie compared to what he's gonna do next.

617
00:47:40,620 --> 00:47:44,710
he must've climbed in through the window. Fire escape.

618
00:47:45,610 --> 00:47:49,550
He made his way down the hall,from room to room.

619
00:47:49,870 --> 00:47:53,790
I walked in on him when he was raping ellen.

620
00:47:54,610 --> 00:47:55,830
I don't know what came over me.

621
00:47:55,860 --> 00:47:59,510
I just ran towards them and jumped on him.

622
00:47:59,550 --> 00:48:01,980
you're a very brave girl,chelsey.

623
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:04,850
well,it didn't do any good.

624
00:48:04,910 --> 00:48:08,100
He just tossed me aside like i was a doll.

625
00:48:08,820 --> 00:48:11,360
And that's when i saw it.

626
00:48:11,430 --> 00:48:12,530
saw what?

627
00:48:12,580 --> 00:48:17,310
his pants were down when he turned towards me and i saw it.

628
00:48:17,370 --> 00:48:19,060
his penis?

629
00:48:19,870 --> 00:48:23,740
no... it wasn't a penis.

630
00:48:23,770 --> 00:48:28,410
It was one of those fake strap-on things.

631
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:36,540
miami police! We are armed!

632
00:48:36,540 --> 00:48:38,930
Surrender yourself immediately!

633
00:49:10,290 --> 00:49:12,490
i can't stop

634
00:49:20,490 --> 00:49:22,480
i'm afraid doing any work on your scars

635
00:49:22,500 --> 00:49:26,200
would be less than prudent for us at this point,quentin,

636
00:49:26,430 --> 00:49:29,740
but we can refer you to dr. Sachs.

637
00:49:33,360 --> 00:49:35,550
a referral?

638
00:49:38,250 --> 00:49:43,000
Who else besides the two of you understands on a deeper level

639
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:46,170
what it would take to make me whole again?

640
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:48,930
That's why i'm here.

641
00:49:48,970 --> 00:49:51,060
obviously,we understand

642
00:49:51,090 --> 00:49:54,860
what you're going through and we sympathize,but...

643
00:49:54,900 --> 00:49:56,730
it's not that we don't want to help you,quentin.

644
00:49:56,750 --> 00:49:58,760
It's just too dangerous for us to do the work.

645
00:49:58,790 --> 00:50:00,100
what do you mean,dangerous?

646
00:50:00,140 --> 00:50:03,030
the carver only came after us because we fixed his victims.

647
00:50:03,060 --> 00:50:05,690
and then he went after my fiancee.

648
00:50:06,060 --> 00:50:08,420
Repairing your face would be too dangerous for us.

649
00:50:08,450 --> 00:50:11,770
We're not willing to take that risk anymore.

650
00:50:11,810 --> 00:50:17,420
You mean in the same way i put myself in danger when i fixed your face,sean?

651
00:50:17,460 --> 00:50:21,340
What about the half dozen sorority girls both of you fixed last night?

652
00:50:23,110 --> 00:50:25,990
That takes care of your danger theory,doesn't it?

653
00:50:26,470 --> 00:50:29,840
Why don't you two just please admit what this is really about?

654
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:31,490
You just don't like me.

655
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:33,030
You never have.

656
00:50:33,070 --> 00:50:35,380
- You never gave me the chance.
- we did give you a chance.

657
00:50:35,410 --> 00:50:38,580
You blew it by consistently being deceptive.

658
00:50:38,810 --> 00:50:39,840
what are you talking about?

659
00:50:39,880 --> 00:50:41,780
- the drug use.
- dating my ex-wife.

660
00:50:41,800 --> 00:50:44,320
screwing a male patient in recovery.

661
00:50:44,360 --> 00:50:46,360
the drugs were a one-time thing.

662
00:50:46,410 --> 00:50:50,460
Dating julia,that just happened.

663
00:50:50,690 --> 00:50:53,810
And as far as brandt is concerned,it was a mistake.

664
00:50:53,840 --> 00:50:56,380
pretending to be a gigolo when you haven't even got a dick...

665
00:50:56,410 --> 00:50:59,360
so if i told you that i was born without a penis,

666
00:50:59,390 --> 00:51:02,190
that would've made everything ok,right?

667
00:51:02,280 --> 00:51:06,470
you mean some twink didn't bite it off during a lover's spat?

668
00:51:10,560 --> 00:51:18,380
Is called a 5-alpha reductase deficiency.

669
00:51:20,470 --> 00:51:23,850
It's a genetic disorder that happens in utero.

670
00:51:23,890 --> 00:51:28,980
And out of hospitals,undergoing hormone therapies and

671
00:51:29,010 --> 00:51:33,010
reconstructive surgeries in order to correct the problem.

672
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:36,660
That made me want to become a surgeon.

673
00:51:36,700 --> 00:51:39,150
what about that college party we went to?

674
00:51:39,190 --> 00:51:40,720
I saw you get a blow job.

675
00:51:40,740 --> 00:51:42,670
she was drunk,sean.

676
00:51:42,710 --> 00:51:45,170
I offered her 100 bucks to pretend i had one.

677
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:46,440
She didn't care.

678
00:51:46,470 --> 00:51:47,390
why would you do that?

679
00:51:47,420 --> 00:51:51,860
because i wanted to feel like one of the boys for once!

680
00:51:52,050 --> 00:51:54,830
Because i wanted to be accepted.

681
00:51:54,860 --> 00:51:56,840
is that why you grabbed my ass in bed with kit?

682
00:51:56,870 --> 00:51:59,290
Because you wanted to be accepted?

683
00:51:59,490 --> 00:52:01,510
i knew that if she took it any further,

684
00:52:01,560 --> 00:52:03,030
that if i took it any further,

685
00:52:03,070 --> 00:52:08,130
she would discover that i didn't have a dick and that would ruin everything.

686
00:52:08,230 --> 00:52:11,350
At least by grabbing your ass...

687
00:52:12,770 --> 00:52:15,360
i got to keep my secret.

688
00:52:19,030 --> 00:52:21,290
I admire you both.

689
00:52:21,330 --> 00:52:23,680
That's why i took the job.

690
00:52:23,710 --> 00:52:25,350
But more than that,i just...

691
00:52:25,370 --> 00:52:27,790
i wanted to be like you.

692
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:31,710
You know,for the first time,it's funny,

693
00:52:31,710 --> 00:52:33,900
all 3 of us have something in common.

694
00:52:33,930 --> 00:52:36,610
We've all been carved.

695
00:52:41,880 --> 00:52:45,350
Yet you still can't treat me like an equal.

696
00:52:50,110 --> 00:52:51,560
wait.

697
00:52:59,800 --> 00:53:02,450
How's thursday for you?

698
00:53:07,270 --> 00:53:08,830
i'm really sorry about the mall,matt.

699
00:53:08,860 --> 00:53:11,740
You know,i was jealous.

700
00:53:11,770 --> 00:53:12,860
I'm human.

701
00:53:12,890 --> 00:53:14,970
yeah,i know. I hear you.

702
00:53:16,620 --> 00:53:19,300
But it's still over between us.

703
00:53:19,930 --> 00:53:23,060
listen,i just want to know.

704
00:53:23,100 --> 00:53:25,920
What does cherry have that i don't have?

705
00:53:27,840 --> 00:53:30,660
see,this is why i didn't want to get in the car.

706
00:53:30,670 --> 00:53:33,510
You're irrational and you don't listen,ariel.

707
00:53:33,550 --> 00:53:36,800
There's nothing between me and cherry.

708
00:53:36,820 --> 00:53:37,730
i just want to know.

709
00:53:37,780 --> 00:53:41,990
I mean,does cherry have a penis?

710
00:53:42,030 --> 00:53:45,080
jesus,ariel! This is insane.

711
00:53:45,110 --> 00:53:48,710
no,just tell me. I just want to know. It doesn't scare me.

712
00:53:48,730 --> 00:53:49,470
Just tell me.

713
00:53:49,500 --> 00:53:52,790
You know,if weird sex is what you want,

714
00:53:52,820 --> 00:53:54,620
i'm totally for that.

715
00:53:54,660 --> 00:53:57,170
You just... you just didn't give me a chance.

716
00:53:57,200 --> 00:53:58,970
Please,matt.

717
00:53:59,310 --> 00:54:00,610
ok.

718
00:54:00,780 --> 00:54:02,120
no,matt,please!

719
00:54:02,140 --> 00:54:04,530
listen,ariel. Settle down.

720
00:54:04,540 --> 00:54:07,270
you heard the man,ariel.

721
00:54:07,310 --> 00:54:09,170
Get off him.

722
00:54:11,510 --> 00:54:13,430
Slide over,matt.

723
00:54:18,630 --> 00:54:20,580
um,what's going on?

724
00:54:20,620 --> 00:54:23,300
a little outing. Just us.

725
00:54:23,340 --> 00:54:24,880
i did what you said,daddy.

726
00:54:24,920 --> 00:54:26,610
I kept him here.

727
00:54:26,710 --> 00:54:28,640
seat belts,everyone.

728
00:54:37,160 --> 00:54:39,690
lasagna. Wow.

729
00:54:40,030 --> 00:54:42,370
reserve judgment 'till you've tried it.

730
00:54:42,420 --> 00:54:47,050
I've had a lot of time to cultivate my culinary skills living on my own.

731
00:54:47,290 --> 00:54:50,340
I think that's been about the only advantage i thought you wanted to go.

732
00:54:50,760 --> 00:54:53,770
over some changes in the mortgage.

733
00:54:53,800 --> 00:54:55,700
after dinner. Eat.

734
00:54:55,960 --> 00:54:59,780
It feels like years since we've sat here and had a meal together.

735
00:54:59,810 --> 00:55:02,920
this is really sweet of you.

736
00:55:04,860 --> 00:55:06,470
What's this?

737
00:55:07,940 --> 00:55:09,380
open it.

738
00:55:11,100 --> 00:55:13,110
it's the deed to our house.

739
00:55:13,150 --> 00:55:17,710
yeah. I want you to have it.

740
00:55:19,710 --> 00:55:22,000
I made the last mortgage payment on it yesterday.

741
00:55:22,030 --> 00:55:23,930
It's officially ours.

742
00:55:25,460 --> 00:55:27,920
But it's always been yours.

743
00:55:29,430 --> 00:55:31,810
i don't know what to say.

744
00:55:32,760 --> 00:55:34,580
you made this house,julia.

745
00:55:34,610 --> 00:55:39,090
You picked the paint,the moldings,every piece of furniture.

746
00:55:40,180 --> 00:55:43,430
You did all the work. I just lived here.

747
00:55:43,900 --> 00:55:47,660
that's very...wonderful of you,

748
00:55:47,680 --> 00:55:51,390
but i can't just kick you out and move back in.

749
00:55:51,420 --> 00:55:53,860
i want you to have it,jules.

750
00:55:53,890 --> 00:55:57,830
The thought of you living here and having our baby here

751
00:55:57,850 --> 00:56:02,400
just really would make me happy.

752
00:56:04,420 --> 00:56:10,880
i can't. L... i wouldn't be comfortable here.

753
00:56:11,880 --> 00:56:18,000
I want to bring this baby into a place that isn't complicated by the past.

754
00:56:18,040 --> 00:56:20,970
You know,i want a fresh start.

755
00:56:22,740 --> 00:56:25,230
I'm sorry.

756
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:43,940
everything's come full circle.

757
00:56:44,020 --> 00:56:45,880
Here i am looking up at the two of you

758
00:56:45,910 --> 00:56:49,420
when i was originally brought down to operate on both of you.

759
00:56:49,890 --> 00:56:53,050
you're going to be fine,quentin,i promise.

760
00:56:53,560 --> 00:56:56,140
count back from 10 for me,ok?

761
00:56:58,660 --> 00:57:05,620
10... 9... 8...

762
00:57:15,740 --> 00:57:17,530
this is the work of an amateur.

763
00:57:17,560 --> 00:57:19,440
are you saying it's not the work of the carver?

764
00:57:19,480 --> 00:57:20,420
it's his work.

765
00:57:20,460 --> 00:57:23,460
I'm just saying it's not as pristine and meticulous.

766
00:57:23,510 --> 00:57:25,330
He's getting sloppy.

767
00:57:29,740 --> 00:57:31,680
what the hell's going on?

768
00:57:42,210 --> 00:57:44,450
you can't come in here.You're contaminating the operation.

769
00:57:44,490 --> 00:57:46,220
elizabeth cruz,you are under arrest

770
00:57:46,260 --> 00:57:51,490
for 18 counts of assault and battery,kidnapping,and the murder of rhea reynolds.

771
00:57:59,730 --> 00:58:01,880
you seem really nervous.

772
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:03,450
i've never been arrested before.

773
00:58:03,470 --> 00:58:06,770
Don't start off by lying.

774
00:58:06,800 --> 00:58:09,370
We both know that isn't true.

775
00:58:12,510 --> 00:58:16,880
i think being hauled in during an act-up march in college

776
00:58:16,900 --> 00:58:20,030
doesn't count the same as being arrested for murder.

777
00:58:20,060 --> 00:58:23,120
i must say,i always admire a woman who's willing to fight for social change

778
00:58:23,150 --> 00:58:26,120
and stand up for what she believes like that.

779
00:58:26,180 --> 00:58:27,710
Is that you,liz?

780
00:58:27,750 --> 00:58:29,730
A woman of conviction?

781
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:31,750
how come when you say it,it sounds like a disease?

782
00:58:31,770 --> 00:58:34,390
i just want to know what it's like for someone like you.

783
00:58:34,410 --> 00:58:36,940
An out lesbian working in a male-dominated field,

784
00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:39,480
helping women stuff their bodies with silicon.

785
00:58:39,500 --> 00:58:43,810
Holding strong to those feminist beliefs must be awfully frustrating at times.

786
00:58:44,500 --> 00:58:46,820
let me save you the trouble,ok?

787
00:58:46,840 --> 00:58:50,640
I am not some bitter feml-nazi trying to get back at the world,

788
00:58:50,670 --> 00:58:54,690
and i certainly didn't carve my bosses as payback for who they are.

789
00:58:54,740 --> 00:58:58,230
And beauty is not a curse,it's a commodity,

790
00:58:58,260 --> 00:59:01,240
and i've never had any illusions about what i do.

791
00:59:01,270 --> 00:59:03,000
bravo.

792
00:59:04,020 --> 00:59:05,910
Make sure you share that philosophy with your kids.

793
00:59:05,940 --> 00:59:07,640
my kids?

794
00:59:07,660 --> 00:59:09,540
Are you sure that you have the right person?

795
00:59:09,570 --> 00:59:11,300
I don't even have cats.

796
00:59:11,320 --> 00:59:14,220
yeah,but you're planning on having children,though,right?

797
00:59:14,420 --> 00:59:19,980
We do have records of your numerous visits to area sperm banks in the last 6 months.

798
00:59:20,010 --> 00:59:22,190
this was for something else.

799
00:59:22,330 --> 00:59:23,560
i'm sure.

800
00:59:23,590 --> 00:59:27,580
All that semen you took must have been for more than just making little lizs,

801
00:59:27,670 --> 00:59:30,630
like planting evidence at crime scenes.

802
00:59:30,670 --> 00:59:32,430
look,i know this sounds weird,

803
00:59:32,450 --> 00:59:35,550
but we were using all of this as an ingredient in a face cream.

804
00:59:35,580 --> 00:59:37,030
that's so stupefyingly bizarre,

805
00:59:37,050 --> 00:59:39,680
it's almost worth entertaining the thought.

806
00:59:42,860 --> 00:59:44,820
Was this in the face cream,too?

807
00:59:44,850 --> 00:59:46,950
60 vials of melaphosphate.

808
00:59:46,970 --> 00:59:50,280
The same kind of tranquilizer the carver uses to paralyze his victims.

809
00:59:50,300 --> 00:59:51,620
i don't know about this order form.

810
00:59:51,640 --> 00:59:52,940
it has your signature on it.

811
00:59:52,960 --> 00:59:54,640
no,somebody forged that.That's not me.

812
00:59:54,660 --> 00:59:58,030
just like it wasn't you who helped keep rhea reynolds awake during her surgery.

813
00:59:58,050 --> 00:59:59,690
Motive and opportunity,liz.

814
00:59:59,710 --> 01:00:02,900
Judges look for that when they're signing arrest warrants.

815
01:00:04,320 --> 01:00:07,410
But what really gets them excited...

816
01:00:08,760 --> 01:00:11,550
is when you show them the means.

817
01:00:14,460 --> 01:00:16,960
We found this in your apartment.

818
01:00:17,810 --> 01:00:21,400
having a sex toy makes me a murder suspect now?

819
01:00:21,420 --> 01:00:24,200
my point is is that you strap this on.

820
01:00:24,260 --> 01:00:26,790
That tells me that you're not wearing it for your own enjoyment,

821
01:00:26,820 --> 01:00:29,120
you're wearing it for someone else,

822
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:31,710
and since you don't have a relationship right now,

823
01:00:31,750 --> 01:00:34,130
i'm just wondering when you get a chance to use it.

824
01:00:34,160 --> 01:00:35,910
i don't.

825
01:00:36,150 --> 01:00:38,640
Not since wendy,and that was 2 years ago.

826
01:00:38,670 --> 01:00:42,030
oh,yes. Wendy.

827
01:00:43,120 --> 01:00:45,330
We spoke to her this afternoon.

828
01:00:45,360 --> 01:00:49,830
Cute girl. A bit young for you,though.

829
01:00:49,920 --> 01:00:51,790
Went back to her husband in case you hadn't heard.

830
01:00:51,810 --> 01:00:53,340
Turns out she was straight.

831
01:00:53,370 --> 01:00:55,160
nobody's perfect.

832
01:00:55,180 --> 01:00:57,800
that's not the real reason she left you,though,is it,liz?

833
01:00:57,830 --> 01:01:01,750
She told us you used to get a bit carried away in your lovemaking.

834
01:01:02,430 --> 01:01:05,300
What was the word she used?

835
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:10,530
Vigorous.

836
01:01:15,050 --> 01:01:16,870
have a bit of a power issue,do we?

837
01:01:16,910 --> 01:01:20,370
yeah,well,someone in this room has a power issue,that's for sure.

838
01:01:20,410 --> 01:01:22,820
psychologically speaking,you're no different from the carver.

839
01:01:22,850 --> 01:01:24,050
i didn' anything!

840
01:01:24,110 --> 01:01:26,090
you have a history of standing up to social norms.

841
01:01:26,120 --> 01:01:28,730
You have a clear need to exercise power over those around you,

842
01:01:28,750 --> 01:01:33,200
and you had an access to the medical tools needed to carry out your plan.

843
01:01:33,340 --> 01:01:37,120
Tell me,now that i've had my face repaired,

844
01:01:37,140 --> 01:01:41,340
don't you just wish you could carve it again?

845
01:01:59,450 --> 01:02:01,810
sorry to keep you waiting,julia.

846
01:02:01,870 --> 01:02:03,140
Sean isn't joining you?

847
01:02:03,170 --> 01:02:04,340
no,not this time.

848
01:02:04,360 --> 01:02:06,310
I told him since we weren't married anymore,

849
01:02:06,340 --> 01:02:10,420
he's not obligated to come to every single gyno appointment.

850
01:02:11,470 --> 01:02:13,110
i see.

851
01:02:15,030 --> 01:02:16,390
what's the matter?

852
01:02:16,420 --> 01:02:18,240
Is something wrong?

853
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:22,030
wE got the results of cvs.

854
01:02:29,230 --> 01:02:30,350
stop it.

855
01:02:30,390 --> 01:02:33,220
stay still or i swear to god you'll regret this.

856
01:02:33,260 --> 01:02:34,120
why are you doing this?

857
01:02:34,140 --> 01:02:36,840
i'm going to make you even prettier than your little girlfriend.

858
01:02:36,860 --> 01:02:39,150
You know,even my mom said you'd make a pretty girl.

859
01:02:39,180 --> 01:02:40,200
At first,i got mad at her,

860
01:02:40,230 --> 01:02:42,470
but now i can kind of see what she means.

861
01:02:42,490 --> 01:02:44,350
ariel,this whole thing's gone too far.

862
01:02:44,380 --> 01:02:48,080
It's gotten waydad seems mental,you seem...

863
01:02:48,110 --> 01:02:49,610
this is appletini green.

864
01:02:49,630 --> 01:02:51,240
It's what cherry wears.

865
01:02:51,280 --> 01:02:52,860
Do you recognize it?

866
01:02:52,890 --> 01:02:54,760
there was real love between us,ariel.

867
01:02:54,780 --> 01:02:57,520
I saw the real you and you blew me away.

868
01:02:57,560 --> 01:02:59,510
It's your dad. He got inside your head.

869
01:02:59,520 --> 01:03:01,220
He's an evil person,ariel,

870
01:03:01,240 --> 01:03:03,080
but you are not evil,you're amazing.

871
01:03:03,100 --> 01:03:05,400
You're more amazing than anyone i've ever known.

872
01:03:05,430 --> 01:03:08,550
hey,you crazy kids down here?

873
01:03:08,580 --> 01:03:10,090
you're a good person,ariel.

874
01:03:10,120 --> 01:03:13,420
You are not evil. Do not do this.

875
01:03:13,530 --> 01:03:15,810
oh,matt,i brought your friend.

876
01:03:15,870 --> 01:03:18,960
jesus christ! You crazy asshole!

877
01:03:19,050 --> 01:03:20,890
Cherry,what did he do to you?

878
01:03:20,930 --> 01:03:22,360
fool's got a gun.

879
01:03:22,390 --> 01:03:28,230
cherry and i had a nice little conversation about hurting innocent people.

880
01:03:28,270 --> 01:03:29,420
Give me that chair. Come on,move it.

881
01:03:29,460 --> 01:03:31,200
Move it over here by your boyfriend.

882
01:03:32,360 --> 01:03:34,430
Give me some room,will you,honey?

883
01:03:34,470 --> 01:03:36,320
dad,this isn't what we agreed on.

884
01:03:36,350 --> 01:03:38,010
We said we were just going to scare them.

885
01:03:38,040 --> 01:03:39,040
We were not gonna hurt them.

886
01:03:39,060 --> 01:03:40,740
tell me something.

887
01:03:41,480 --> 01:03:45,360
Do you like the fact that this infectious faggot

888
01:03:45,390 --> 01:03:49,470
has been sticking its tongue in your boyfriend's mouth?

889
01:03:49,500 --> 01:03:50,950
Is that ok with you,ariel?

890
01:03:50,980 --> 01:03:52,180
No. Is it ok with you

891
01:03:52,220 --> 01:03:58,170
that when people find out that my daughter has been screwing a homosexual

892
01:03:58,200 --> 01:04:02,730
that your reputation and mine are gonna be damaged beyond repair?

893
01:04:02,750 --> 01:04:04,200
dad,this isn't what we agreed on!

894
01:04:04,230 --> 01:04:06,290
no,and we also didn't agree that you'd fall in love with this little pervert!

895
01:04:06,320 --> 01:04:08,750
ariel,you call the cops. You call the cops!

896
01:04:08,790 --> 01:04:10,670
go on!

897
01:04:11,060 --> 01:04:12,810
I'll take care of it.

898
01:04:12,860 --> 01:04:14,170
ariel.

899
01:04:15,100 --> 01:04:16,610
shut up.

900
01:04:19,230 --> 01:04:20,850
what are you going to do?

901
01:04:23,850 --> 01:04:28,640
oh,don't you worry,pretty girl.

902
01:04:28,940 --> 01:04:32,500
I'm gonna make all your dreams come true.

903
01:04:40,300 --> 01:04:43,120
blood panel looks good,dr. Costa.

904
01:04:48,580 --> 01:04:50,030
All right,let's...

905
01:05:08,900 --> 01:05:10,120
oh,god!

906
01:05:10,280 --> 01:05:11,580
you stop your sniveling.

907
01:05:11,630 --> 01:05:12,910
I'm not going to use these on you.

908
01:05:12,960 --> 01:05:14,450
That would be barbaric.

909
01:05:14,470 --> 01:05:19,520
I just wanted to see if they had any rust on them before i trim the privet tomorrow.

910
01:05:19,550 --> 01:05:23,290
No,i'm going to use...

911
01:05:23,320 --> 01:05:25,030
yeah,this.

912
01:05:25,870 --> 01:05:27,910
Do you know what this is,matt? Hmm?

913
01:05:27,940 --> 01:05:28,940
no

914
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:30,960
it's a box-cutter,

915
01:05:30,980 --> 01:05:34,160
which makes sense because i'm going to use it

916
01:05:34,190 --> 01:05:39,520
to give one of you the box that you so desperately crave.

917
01:05:39,560 --> 01:05:40,390
See,i just can't figure out

918
01:05:40,430 --> 01:05:44,450
which one of you is the girl in this relationship and which one's the man.

919
01:05:44,470 --> 01:05:46,940
Or do you take turns?

920
01:05:48,160 --> 01:05:53,060
Well,gentlemen,this is your lucky day because i'm here to help.

921
01:05:53,090 --> 01:05:56,780
One of you gets to be a woman.

922
01:05:56,840 --> 01:06:00,130
The only question is which one of you is prettier?

923
01:06:00,510 --> 01:06:04,020
Hmm? Hmm?

924
01:06:08,010 --> 01:06:09,720
Oh,my.

925
01:06:12,130 --> 01:06:15,300
Matt... you win.

926
01:06:15,340 --> 01:06:18,480
That shadow really brings out your eyes.

927
01:06:19,590 --> 01:06:21,270
Stand up.

928
01:06:21,360 --> 01:06:24,050
Come on,come on,come on.

929
01:06:35,380 --> 01:06:38,670
tell me what you don't like about yourself.

930
01:06:40,390 --> 01:06:46,260
You two are the most irritating,stubborn couple of assholes i've ever met.

931
01:06:47,180 --> 01:06:51,250
A year ago,i jet down to miami,the sodom of the south,

932
01:06:51,270 --> 01:06:53,970
to make a little statement with the naomi gaines girl,

933
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:57,530
and you two have to pull a john wayne and destroy my beautiful work.

934
01:06:57,560 --> 01:06:59,420
how can you do this to people,quentin?

935
01:06:59,450 --> 01:07:00,680
You're a physician.

936
01:07:00,700 --> 01:07:01,730
exactly.

937
01:07:01,770 --> 01:07:03,670
And i came to this city of flesh to heal it,

938
01:07:03,700 --> 01:07:06,320
to free it from the tyranny of beauty.

939
01:07:06,350 --> 01:07:08,420
To save it,body and soul,from grotesque,

940
01:07:08,470 --> 01:07:14,490
unnecessary face lifts and ridiculous calf implants.

941
01:07:14,520 --> 01:07:16,650
But you two wouldn't let me be.

942
01:07:16,950 --> 01:07:19,580
I have to admit,i took it very personally.

943
01:07:19,600 --> 01:07:22,230
you should've taken it personally,you sack of shit!

944
01:07:22,250 --> 01:07:24,640
You think we're gonna let people walk around scarred for the rest of their lives?

945
01:07:24,670 --> 01:07:27,270
they weren't scarred,they were liberated.

946
01:07:29,370 --> 01:07:31,950
I think we need some surgery music.

947
01:07:41,650 --> 01:07:44,130
ah,i tried warning you.

948
01:07:44,330 --> 01:07:49,150
Hell,i'd say i was downright magnanimous with you,sean,in your bathroom.

949
01:07:49,170 --> 01:07:52,050
If you had just listened to me,

950
01:07:52,070 --> 01:07:57,130
i might not have had the need to escalate things and pop christian's cherry.

951
01:07:57,160 --> 01:07:58,240
bullshit.

952
01:07:58,260 --> 01:08:00,460
You're just a freaking eunuch

953
01:08:00,480 --> 01:08:03,440
who needs to rape people with a strap-on to make yourself feel like a man!

954
01:08:05,100 --> 01:08:10,010
how manly did you feel when i was owning your tight white ass,pretty boy?

955
01:08:14,980 --> 01:08:18,240
If you want to release someone from the prison of their reflection,

956
01:08:18,260 --> 01:08:22,370
you need to destroy them physically and sexually.

957
01:08:22,580 --> 01:08:24,300
I am not dahmer or bundy.

958
01:08:24,330 --> 01:08:26,430
I don't rape to possess,

959
01:08:26,460 --> 01:08:29,630
i rape to enlighten.

960
01:08:29,680 --> 01:08:31,800
like you enlightened kimber?

961
01:08:33,580 --> 01:08:35,210
kimber moved me.

962
01:08:35,260 --> 01:08:36,560
I had to save her.

963
01:08:36,590 --> 01:08:38,600
You turned her into a monster.

964
01:08:38,650 --> 01:08:42,530
I fixed her,released her from your gilded cage.

965
01:08:42,560 --> 01:08:46,760
you think some other plastic surgeons aren't just gonna take our places?

966
01:08:48,080 --> 01:08:50,390
oh,sean,please. Give me some credit.

967
01:08:50,410 --> 01:08:51,810
I'm not a killer.

968
01:08:51,920 --> 01:08:54,080
tell that to rhea reynolds.

969
01:08:54,160 --> 01:08:57,480
That's different.Rhea offended me.

970
01:08:58,430 --> 01:09:03,730
No,killing you won't stop other surgeons from fixing my patients.

971
01:09:11,460 --> 01:09:13,870
we've become desensitized to murder.

972
01:09:14,560 --> 01:09:18,620
Brutality,torture,barbarism...

973
01:09:19,200 --> 01:09:22,040
now those are headline grabbers.

974
01:09:29,710 --> 01:09:32,500
why,that blade's kinda dull.

975
01:09:32,530 --> 01:09:35,360
I'm afraid this is gonna hurt more than i thought.

976
01:09:35,850 --> 01:09:37,630
you won't get away with it,quentin.

977
01:09:37,670 --> 01:09:39,680
Now we know who you are.

978
01:09:41,420 --> 01:09:42,980
understood.

979
01:09:43,160 --> 01:09:46,630
But revealing my identity to you was the only way that i could assure

980
01:09:46,660 --> 01:09:48,560
that my message would be taken seriously.

981
01:09:48,600 --> 01:09:51,330
Who's gonna listen to the ramblings of some psychotic?

982
01:09:51,380 --> 01:09:54,870
But the well thought-out philosophy of a highly trained,

983
01:09:54,900 --> 01:09:57,380
highly skilled plastic surgeon?

984
01:09:57,430 --> 01:10:00,940
Now,those quotes end up on the
front page of the times.

985
01:10:00,970 --> 01:10:04,730
My greatest fear is being relegated to the lunatic fringe.

986
01:10:04,750 --> 01:10:07,210
That's why i couldn't let you take all the credit for this,christian.

987
01:10:07,250 --> 01:10:13,420
I am neither a psychotic nor a shallow,mediocre surgeon.

988
01:10:13,450 --> 01:10:15,110
I'm an artist.

989
01:10:17,670 --> 01:10:19,670
What are you afraid of,hmm?

990
01:10:19,700 --> 01:10:21,100
Death?

991
01:10:29,540 --> 01:10:30,810
you know something?

992
01:10:30,850 --> 01:10:32,980
I can't do this.

993
01:10:39,230 --> 01:10:40,360
what are you doing?

994
01:10:40,400 --> 01:10:43,450
the question is: What are you doing?

995
01:10:43,480 --> 01:10:45,440
And the answer is...

996
01:10:45,470 --> 01:10:48,360
you're doing it to yourself.

997
01:10:48,650 --> 01:10:50,250
Take it.

998
01:10:59,850 --> 01:11:04,480
now... you've insulted me.

999
01:11:04,770 --> 01:11:06,320
Hmm?

1000
01:11:06,800 --> 01:11:10,960
to a surgeon,what would be most precious?

1001
01:11:11,010 --> 01:11:18,130
What would a surgeon be the most afraid of being without,hmm?

1002
01:11:21,610 --> 01:11:23,470
A surgeon without his fingers.

1003
01:11:23,510 --> 01:11:26,590
That's kinda like a man without a penis,no? No?

1004
01:11:29,920 --> 01:11:31,410
cut it off,matt.

1005
01:11:31,440 --> 01:11:33,190
i can't.

1006
01:11:33,240 --> 01:11:35,180
ariel! I know you're up there! Please help me!

1007
01:11:35,200 --> 01:11:36,850
that really doesn't do it for me.

1008
01:11:36,870 --> 01:11:38,620
Kind of a let down.

1009
01:11:38,640 --> 01:11:43,290
Do you know what separates us from beasts,huh?

1010
01:11:43,330 --> 01:11:44,960
What allowed us to evolve,

1011
01:11:44,990 --> 01:11:48,040
use tools,create this pisshole of a world we live in?

1012
01:11:48,060 --> 01:11:49,670
Opposable thumbs.

1013
01:11:49,700 --> 01:11:52,220
we can do this...

1014
01:11:52,250 --> 01:11:55,520
and abracadabra... we have light beer and tivo.

1015
01:11:55,550 --> 01:11:57,690
Without our thumbs,we're nothing.

1016
01:11:57,710 --> 01:12:00,120
You know what they call a surgeon without his thumbs?

1017
01:12:00,540 --> 01:12:01,840
Homeless.

1018
01:12:01,890 --> 01:12:03,070
please!

1019
01:12:03,090 --> 01:12:04,910
wait! Wait!

1020
01:12:05,260 --> 01:12:06,980
take mine off instead.

1021
01:12:07,010 --> 01:12:07,750
christian,don't!

1022
01:12:07,780 --> 01:12:09,380
shut up,sean! Come on,quentin!

1023
01:12:09,410 --> 01:12:12,730
One lame surgeon should be enough to prove your point!

1024
01:12:15,340 --> 01:12:17,350
now this is starting to get really fascinating.

1025
01:12:17,370 --> 01:12:20,170
now that sounds like a fair trade.

1026
01:12:20,980 --> 01:12:23,160
But the only thing is...

1027
01:12:23,690 --> 01:12:26,370
matt's got to do it.

1028
01:12:26,420 --> 01:12:26,950
i don't know,christian.

1029
01:12:26,980 --> 01:12:29,240
I mean,sean's a talent,you know?

1030
01:12:29,280 --> 01:12:31,230
just leave him alone.

1031
01:12:31,270 --> 01:12:33,090
This is really beautiful.

1032
01:12:33,130 --> 01:12:34,930
You two really love each other.

1033
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:36,440
It's touching.

1034
01:12:37,300 --> 01:12:39,620
But it's still not a fair trade.

1035
01:12:39,650 --> 01:12:41,600
I want the whole hand.

1036
01:12:49,610 --> 01:12:51,380
right or left?

1037
01:12:53,670 --> 01:12:55,730
whichever one you want.

1038
01:12:55,780 --> 01:12:58,740
I'll kill you with whatever i have left.

1039
01:12:59,700 --> 01:13:00,750
ok.

1040
01:13:04,820 --> 01:13:07,470
i'm strong,matt. It's ok.

1041
01:13:09,270 --> 01:13:12,040
It's what i always wanted anyway.

1042
01:13:12,270 --> 01:13:13,460
no.

1043
01:13:19,220 --> 01:13:20,570
i can't do it.

1044
01:13:20,620 --> 01:13:23,240
I can't do it,christian.I like you too much.

1045
01:13:23,290 --> 01:13:27,240
I mean,we've made love,hmm?

1046
01:13:32,800 --> 01:13:34,570
you're gonna have to do it.

1047
01:13:34,600 --> 01:13:37,570
whoa! Hey! That is really hostile.

1048
01:13:37,590 --> 01:13:40,550
You know,i would really be careful with that if i were you.

1049
01:13:40,590 --> 01:13:45,860
I would hate for you to slip and slit your friend's throat with it.

1050
01:13:47,790 --> 01:13:49,900
Do it,christian.

1051
01:13:50,400 --> 01:13:52,420
Now!

1052
01:14:07,010 --> 01:14:10,340
cut your other hand free,matt,and do it.

1053
01:14:14,680 --> 01:14:16,830
There you go.

1054
01:14:17,830 --> 01:14:21,290
Now cut it off on the count of 3.

1055
01:14:21,330 --> 01:14:26,680
cut it off or i will kill you.

1056
01:14:29,890 --> 01:14:31,710
i'm so sorry.

1057
01:14:31,750 --> 01:14:32,940
it's ok.

1058
01:14:32,990 --> 01:14:34,850
1...

1059
01:14:34,960 --> 01:14:36,330
2...

1060
01:14:39,180 --> 01:14:41,090
do it,christian.

1061
01:14:41,640 --> 01:14:43,130
Do it!

1062
01:15:25,140 --> 01:15:29,100
make sure you don't start the autopsy without me.

1063
01:15:45,360 --> 01:15:46,930
look,we can save her.

1064
01:15:46,970 --> 01:15:48,000
It's not murder yet.

1065
01:15:48,030 --> 01:15:51,060
matt! You've taken your licks.

1066
01:15:51,090 --> 01:15:53,410
You've learned your lesson.

1067
01:15:56,810 --> 01:16:02,300
put that filthy tranny out of its misery.

1068
01:16:28,650 --> 01:16:29,580
where do you think you're going?

1069
01:16:29,620 --> 01:16:30,630
shoot me. I don't care anymore.

1070
01:16:30,660 --> 01:16:32,070
get back here!

1071
01:16:32,110 --> 01:16:33,830
You shovel that goddamn dirt into that grave

1072
01:16:33,880 --> 01:16:37,570
or i swear your dead weight is gonna finish her off.

1073
01:16:37,600 --> 01:16:39,700
did you not hear me?

1074
01:16:39,740 --> 01:16:42,010
I don't care!

1075
01:16:45,330 --> 01:16:47,750
You want two dead bodies?

1076
01:16:49,010 --> 01:16:50,500
Shoot me.

1077
01:17:02,180 --> 01:17:05,020
you haven't got the guts.

1078
01:17:08,250 --> 01:17:10,740
You didn't have the guts to cut cherry,

1079
01:17:10,790 --> 01:17:15,100
and you don't have the guts to pull that trigger now,do you,eugene?

1080
01:17:26,380 --> 01:17:27,990
is he dead?

1081
01:17:28,220 --> 01:17:31,730
i don't know,but he will be.

1082
01:17:39,340 --> 01:17:40,820
matt?

1083
01:17:44,660 --> 01:17:46,450
Please.

1084
01:17:48,330 --> 01:17:50,040
do it.

1085
01:17:56,590 --> 01:18:01,910
i see no reason to prolong my stay here in the states now that my work is finished.

1086
01:18:01,940 --> 01:18:05,710
you must feel a sense of satisfaction,having closed the case,

1087
01:18:05,750 --> 01:18:08,880
knowing you stopped someone from destroying more lives.

1088
01:18:08,920 --> 01:18:12,570
killing a human being never feels good,dr. Mcnamara.

1089
01:18:12,570 --> 01:18:15,770
he was a deranged psychopath,a murderer.

1090
01:18:15,820 --> 01:18:18,260
but no one's born that way,are they?

1091
01:18:19,030 --> 01:18:23,020
No child who's experienced what quentin experienced can be expected to grow up sane.

1092
01:18:23,060 --> 01:18:28,840
The physical deformities he endured,abandoned by his parents,placed in a convent.

1093
01:18:28,900 --> 01:18:29,570
how do you know?

1094
01:18:29,600 --> 01:18:35,290
we uncovered a crude journal of sorts,begun in childhood.

1095
01:18:35,320 --> 01:18:39,550
It provided us with clues to a secret past that he was determined to remember,

1096
01:18:39,600 --> 01:18:42,020
but never to be revealed.

1097
01:18:43,660 --> 01:18:47,910
He had a sister,a younger sister,

1098
01:18:47,950 --> 01:18:51,070
even more hideously deformed than he was.

1099
01:18:51,110 --> 01:18:53,000
The results of incest.

1100
01:18:53,040 --> 01:18:56,520
Frontonasal dysplasia is the technical term.

1101
01:18:56,580 --> 01:18:58,890
median cleft face syndrome.

1102
01:18:59,220 --> 01:19:03,140
their parents sent them to an isolated convent in northern maine.

1103
01:19:03,360 --> 01:19:06,400
The fruits of their carnal pleasure were too much to bear.

1104
01:19:06,920 --> 01:19:09,650
Quenten's deformities could be cloaked,

1105
01:19:09,680 --> 01:19:11,670
violet's could not.

1106
01:19:11,780 --> 01:19:13,350
Perspective parents would come...

1107
01:19:13,370 --> 01:19:16,010
violet,you have visitors.

1108
01:19:21,960 --> 01:19:24,430
but quentin refused to let them be separated.

1109
01:19:24,500 --> 01:19:25,490
and what happened?

1110
01:19:25,520 --> 01:19:28,270
How did he go from being the boy you're describing...

1111
01:19:28,300 --> 01:19:30,700
to the serial rapist he became?

1112
01:19:31,200 --> 01:19:33,400
He was 15 when they left the convent.

1113
01:19:33,420 --> 01:19:35,650
But quentin was driven and bright.

1114
01:19:35,700 --> 01:19:38,870
He put himself through med school and became a plastic surgeon,

1115
01:19:38,910 --> 01:19:43,570
determined to help his sister conform to our culture's demand for physical beauty...

1116
01:19:44,370 --> 01:19:47,190
so that,finally,they could both be loved.

1117
01:19:52,870 --> 01:19:54,340
beauty is a curse.

1118
01:19:54,370 --> 01:19:59,200
violet underwent 8 surgeries at her brother's hand to repair the division in her face,

1119
01:19:59,280 --> 01:20:01,990
to close the bones in her skull.

1120
01:20:02,790 --> 01:20:05,360
3 more attempts to repair the skin abnormalities

1121
01:20:05,390 --> 01:20:08,900
so that finally others would look at her without gasping in horror.

1122
01:20:10,950 --> 01:20:14,890
During the final surgery,before he could finish,

1123
01:20:15,790 --> 01:20:19,460
xx

1124
01:20:19,670 --> 01:20:22,860
she suffered a stroke and died.

1125
01:20:23,640 --> 01:20:25,970
She was 29.

1126
01:20:26,750 --> 01:20:28,690
so he blamed us?

1127
01:20:30,760 --> 01:20:34,900
as plastic surgeons,you exploit the social pressures that caused her such agony.

1128
01:20:34,930 --> 01:20:37,700
but he could have gone anywhere,some other practice.

1129
01:20:37,740 --> 01:20:40,130
it's the sunshine state.

1130
01:20:40,230 --> 01:20:42,620
The requirements for beauty are greatest here.

1131
01:20:42,650 --> 01:20:44,770
He could make a statement and be heard.

1132
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:46,970
He could vent his rage here.

1133
01:20:52,170 --> 01:20:59,510
we,uh,appreciate your diligence and your impeccable timing,kit.

1134
01:21:01,370 --> 01:21:03,530
You saved our lives.

1135
01:21:03,950 --> 01:21:06,910
i'm just glad that gina called 911 when she did.

1136
01:21:06,930 --> 01:21:08,400
How is she?

1137
01:21:08,510 --> 01:21:10,790
don't screw this up,asshole.

1138
01:21:10,810 --> 01:21:12,580
I'm planning to get a book deal out of this,

1139
01:21:12,580 --> 01:21:15,100
and i don't want to look like the joker on my dust jacket.

1140
01:21:15,120 --> 01:21:16,410
what's the title gonna be?

1141
01:21:16,440 --> 01:21:18,660
Even the carver wouldn't stick his dick in me?

1142
01:21:18,670 --> 01:21:21,070
oh,that's nice,christian.

1143
01:21:21,280 --> 01:21:22,700
what were you doing here,gina?

1144
01:21:22,730 --> 01:21:25,840
I mean,talk about being at the wrong place at the wrong time.

1145
01:21:25,870 --> 01:21:29,010
i was dropping off a christmas gift for him.

1146
01:21:29,050 --> 01:21:32,040
I was invited to this big new year's eve party

1147
01:21:32,070 --> 01:21:34,190
and with everything that happened with kimber,

1148
01:21:34,220 --> 01:21:40,500
i thought you might actually be vulnerable enough to be my date.

1149
01:21:41,500 --> 01:21:44,100
Maybe just be open to a petty screw.

1150
01:21:44,130 --> 01:21:48,100
i would never be vulnerable enough to screw you again,gina.

1151
01:21:51,660 --> 01:21:54,270
I wouldn't want to ruin our friendship.

1152
01:21:54,770 --> 01:21:56,850
i'm just grateful that you were here,gina.

1153
01:21:56,880 --> 01:21:58,510
If it wasn't for your 911 call,

1154
01:21:58,540 --> 01:22:00,750
kit would never have made it here in time.

1155
01:22:00,780 --> 01:22:03,040
what 911 call?

1156
01:22:04,540 --> 01:22:10,760
Whatever he drugged me with knocked me out until after the police showed up.

1157
01:22:24,020 --> 01:22:26,100
what took you so long?

1158
01:22:29,090 --> 01:22:32,150
you know what? This reeks of obsessive-compulsive to me.

1159
01:22:32,190 --> 01:22:35,880
Traveling all the way to northern maine so that we can visit some godforsaken orphanage.

1160
01:22:35,910 --> 01:22:37,230
I don't see why this is our problem.

1161
01:22:37,270 --> 01:22:38,760
because it's nobody else's.

1162
01:22:38,800 --> 01:22:40,470
Cops don't want to hear about it.

1163
01:22:40,510 --> 01:22:42,920
It's a high-profile case that's solved. That's it.

1164
01:22:42,960 --> 01:22:44,830
No more questions. Case closed.

1165
01:22:44,860 --> 01:22:46,460
Well,it's not closed for me.

1166
01:22:46,490 --> 01:22:48,310
Kit lied about gina calling 911.

1167
01:22:48,340 --> 01:22:49,490
What else did she lie about?

1168
01:22:49,510 --> 01:22:51,890
what's coming here in person gonna solve,huh?

1169
01:22:51,910 --> 01:22:55,180
Find out that the sisters of the most holy thorny crown are involved in the cover-up?

1170
01:22:55,210 --> 01:22:57,270
i expect to find the truth,

1171
01:22:57,320 --> 01:23:01,310
what kit said about quentin really happened and put this nightmare behind us.

1172
01:23:01,340 --> 01:23:02,420
excuse me?

1173
01:23:04,030 --> 01:23:05,650
May i help you?

1174
01:23:06,350 --> 01:23:07,520
yes.

1175
01:23:07,620 --> 01:23:11,130
An associate of ours who grew up here recently died.

1176
01:23:11,170 --> 01:23:13,250
His name was quentin costa.We were hoping...

1177
01:23:13,290 --> 01:23:15,400
dr. Costa?

1178
01:23:16,270 --> 01:23:18,150
Will you wait here a moment?

1179
01:23:18,180 --> 01:23:20,990
I'll go get mother mary claire.

1180
01:23:25,610 --> 01:23:27,710
how did he die? Quentin.

1181
01:23:27,970 --> 01:23:29,800
he was shot.

1182
01:23:29,840 --> 01:23:31,140
Wrong place at the wrong time.

1183
01:23:31,170 --> 01:23:32,320
It's under investigation.

1184
01:23:32,350 --> 01:23:34,780
we understand he grew up here.

1185
01:23:34,800 --> 01:23:40,170
yes. I'd only been here a short while when he came to us with his poor sister.

1186
01:23:40,200 --> 01:23:43,060
They were very devoted to each other.

1187
01:23:43,130 --> 01:23:46,130
he must have been heartbroken when she died.

1188
01:23:46,180 --> 01:23:50,860
dear lord. She died as well?I had no idea.

1189
01:23:50,910 --> 01:23:53,150
in her twenties. That's what we were told.

1190
01:23:53,170 --> 01:23:54,350
that's not possible.

1191
01:23:54,400 --> 01:23:55,630
Many of our children,

1192
01:23:55,660 --> 01:24:01,190
they send us photographs around this time of year to keep in touch.

1193
01:24:02,750 --> 01:24:07,780
I believe we received a picture from them 2-3 years ago.

1194
01:24:07,810 --> 01:24:09,080
according to the police,

1195
01:24:09,120 --> 01:24:11,950
violet died during a surgical procedure.

1196
01:24:11,980 --> 01:24:13,620
violet?

1197
01:24:14,050 --> 01:24:16,020
Her name's katherine.

1198
01:24:16,680 --> 01:24:18,350
We called her kit.

1199
01:24:18,410 --> 01:24:21,660
She relocated to a suburb outside london years ago.

1200
01:24:21,670 --> 01:24:24,910
I don't have an address on her,i'm afraid.

1201
01:24:28,750 --> 01:24:31,310
malaga,spain

1202
01:24:43,350 --> 01:24:45,020
gracias.

1203
01:24:49,010 --> 01:24:50,650
careful,sis.

1204
01:24:50,730 --> 01:24:55,060
You remember what i had to do to you the last time you got too involved with a  I man.

1205
01:24:56,150 --> 01:25:00,080
spent too much time creating your face to have to carve it up again.

1206
01:25:00,300 --> 01:25:03,090
jealousy is so unattractive.

1207
01:25:03,620 --> 01:25:06,400
You know christian was just a passing fancy.

1208
01:25:06,510 --> 01:25:08,190
Is that why you managed to show up at his office

1209
01:25:08,220 --> 01:25:11,060
right before i got him to take his own hand off?

1210
01:25:11,080 --> 01:25:12,890
i arrived at the exact time we arranged.

1211
01:25:12,920 --> 01:25:15,730
Don't you dare lecture me about that.

1212
01:25:15,830 --> 01:25:19,490
You think i like having to carve you up and then shoot you?

1213
01:25:20,100 --> 01:25:21,590
well,i'd have been more comfortable with the plan

1214
01:25:21,620 --> 01:25:26,550
if you didn't decided to go off book and tell those two my entire life story.

1215
01:25:26,830 --> 01:25:29,770
i needed them to understand you.

1216
01:25:29,850 --> 01:25:31,260
You're not a deranged lunatic.

1217
01:25:31,290 --> 01:25:32,800
You're a good man

1218
01:25:32,820 --> 01:25:37,750
who struggled his whole life against odds that they can't even imagine.

1219
01:25:40,540 --> 01:25:44,460
Now stop being such a whiny bitch and drink your sangria.

1220
01:25:44,840 --> 01:25:48,060
What was the harm anyway?They think you're dead.

1221
01:26:06,360 --> 01:26:08,220
did you see her?

1222
01:26:08,740 --> 01:26:11,210
Her only birth defect was being born rich,

1223
01:26:11,250 --> 01:26:15,200
and she still had her tits,nose,and lips done.

1224
01:26:15,240 --> 01:26:17,070
and lipo.

1225
01:26:21,560 --> 01:26:23,970
Perhaps i should pay her a house call.

1226
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,730
can't we just relax a few days?

1227
01:26:34,400 --> 01:26:37,050
a doctor's work is never done.

1228
01:26:44,570 --> 01:26:46,850
are you coming or what?

1229
01:27:13,840 --> 01:27:15,870
do we have to wait for the water to boil?

1230
01:27:15,920 --> 01:27:17,930
god,that smells so good.

1231
01:27:17,960 --> 01:27:19,460
don't encourage him,julia.

1232
01:27:19,500 --> 01:27:21,180
she already tasted my one dish.

1233
01:27:21,230 --> 01:27:22,950
She's not that impressed,believe me.

1234
01:27:22,980 --> 01:27:24,750
Honey,you want to set the table?

1235
01:27:24,880 --> 01:27:27,640
you're really getting into this cooking now,aren't you?

1236
01:27:27,690 --> 01:27:29,150
well,if this doesn't heal,

1237
01:27:29,180 --> 01:27:31,840
i'm gonna have to learn to do something with my time.

1238
01:27:31,900 --> 01:27:35,500
hey,you had the best microsurgeon in florida operate on your pinky.

1239
01:27:35,530 --> 01:27:37,640
I think you're gonna be just fine.

1240
01:27:42,890 --> 01:27:44,250
well...

1241
01:27:44,420 --> 01:27:45,340
hello there.

1242
01:27:45,380 --> 01:27:47,330
hey. Um...

1243
01:27:48,740 --> 01:27:51,310
you mind if i crash your party?

1244
01:27:51,360 --> 01:27:54,620
it's just a boring family dinner.

1245
01:27:57,100 --> 01:28:00,570
i could use a little boring right now.

1246
01:28:02,040 --> 01:28:07,240
well,in that case,why don't you help me watch the water boil,huh?

1247
01:28:09,390 --> 01:28:12,040
um,can i talk to you for a minute before dinner?

1248
01:28:12,080 --> 01:28:13,440
sure.

1249
01:28:18,840 --> 01:28:20,050
what's up?

1250
01:28:24,580 --> 01:28:26,470
The deed.

1251
01:28:27,870 --> 01:28:31,320
I guess you're not gonna take me up on my offer.

1252
01:28:32,190 --> 01:28:34,840
you didn't read it yet.

1253
01:28:39,780 --> 01:28:43,880
I got the county clerk to put both our names on it.

1254
01:28:43,920 --> 01:28:47,180
That way,we own the house together.

1255
01:28:49,110 --> 01:28:51,940
I want the house,sean...

1256
01:28:51,990 --> 01:28:55,210
but only if you're still in it.

1257
01:28:59,730 --> 01:29:02,770
Please stay so that...

1258
01:29:02,990 --> 01:29:06,700
we can have the baby here together?
