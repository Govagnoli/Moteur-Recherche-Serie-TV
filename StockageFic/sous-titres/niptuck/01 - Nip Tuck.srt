1
00:00:01,786 --> 00:00:04,619
Tell me what you don't like
about yourself.

2
00:00:04,856 --> 00:00:07,256
My brother would like a new nose.

3
00:00:07,425 --> 00:00:10,087
He's also interested in a new jaw line.

4
00:00:10,161 --> 00:00:13,187
He has severe acne scars, as you can see.

5
00:00:13,798 --> 00:00:15,857
He would like those removed, please.

6
00:00:15,934 --> 00:00:19,461
And my brother's very self-conscious
about his hairline.

7
00:00:19,637 --> 00:00:21,161
The Rogaine...

8
00:00:21,606 --> 00:00:23,130
it didn't work.

9
00:00:23,575 --> 00:00:26,009
-I'm sorry. Alejandro, is it?
-Yes.

10
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:28,670
I'm not comfortable
having you speak for your brother...

11
00:00:28,746 --> 00:00:31,579
when he's the one
requesting such extensive surgery.

12
00:00:31,649 --> 00:00:34,345
Mr. Perez, maybe
you could talk to me about--

13
00:00:34,419 --> 00:00:36,284
My brother doesn't speak English.

14
00:00:36,354 --> 00:00:38,948
I'm sorry. I don't speak Spanish.

15
00:00:40,658 --> 00:00:43,718
You live in Miami,
and you don't speak Spanish?

16
00:00:43,928 --> 00:00:45,953
Take a Berlitz class, man.

17
00:01:05,450 --> 00:01:08,283
Ass implants.
What will they think of next?

18
00:01:09,754 --> 00:01:10,880
We need to switch.

19
00:01:10,955 --> 00:01:13,753
There's a potential patient in my office
I don't understand.

20
00:01:13,825 --> 00:01:16,259
Feel him out. See if you suspect BDD.

21
00:01:16,327 --> 00:01:17,954
Will do, partner.

22
00:01:24,469 --> 00:01:26,869
-You put this in wrong.
-I'm sorry?

23
00:01:26,938 --> 00:01:29,668
This implant. You put it in upside down.

24
00:01:31,743 --> 00:01:33,608
You save my ass again.

25
00:01:34,445 --> 00:01:35,707
And hers.

26
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:27,957
Wanna talk about the real reason
you came here?

27
00:02:28,032 --> 00:02:31,593
<i>And do me a favor, when you answer,
drop the no hablo English bullshit.</i>

28
00:02:31,669 --> 00:02:34,103
lt doesn't add to my confusion
about your predicament.

29
00:02:34,172 --> 00:02:37,005
lt only highlights your own. I'm a doctor.

30
00:02:37,375 --> 00:02:40,742
What you tell me during consultation
is confidential.

31
00:02:41,345 --> 00:02:43,575
I prefer to let my money talk.

32
00:02:46,984 --> 00:02:48,508
Nice alligator.

33
00:02:50,388 --> 00:02:53,789
$20,000, according to your website.
That's your fee.

34
00:02:54,625 --> 00:02:56,217
Funny, isn't it?

35
00:02:56,861 --> 00:02:59,830
How certain things from Colombia
have that pungent aroma...

36
00:02:59,897 --> 00:03:01,364
that can stink up a room.

37
00:03:01,432 --> 00:03:02,899
Coffee, for instance.

38
00:03:02,967 --> 00:03:05,697
And, of course, there is the cartel money.

39
00:03:08,606 --> 00:03:10,267
I'm not Colombian.

40
00:03:11,275 --> 00:03:13,004
My brother and l...

41
00:03:13,211 --> 00:03:14,974
we are Argentinean.

42
00:03:15,146 --> 00:03:17,376
Mr. Perez, if you were Argentinean...

43
00:03:17,448 --> 00:03:19,382
I wouldn't recommend porcelain veneers.

44
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:23,409
It's the only South American country
with fluoride in the water.

45
00:03:25,156 --> 00:03:27,647
One last time, why are you running?

46
00:03:30,528 --> 00:03:32,655
I was with the boss' girl.

47
00:03:34,365 --> 00:03:36,629
Mr. Perez, you cad.

48
00:03:48,246 --> 00:03:51,306
I'm still trying to get to the bottom of this.

49
00:04:26,717 --> 00:04:30,585
I don't think this guy's got BDD.
His expectations aren't unrealistic.

50
00:04:30,655 --> 00:04:32,452
He doesn't want to look like Tom Cruise.

51
00:04:32,523 --> 00:04:35,424
He's just divorced and wants a fresh start.

52
00:04:38,329 --> 00:04:39,694
<i>Señor Perez...</i>

53
00:05:35,052 --> 00:05:37,111
Single or doubles?

54
00:05:40,224 --> 00:05:42,749
Doubles. I'm meeting my boyfriend.

55
00:05:47,899 --> 00:05:49,764
Can I buy you a drink?

56
00:05:50,034 --> 00:05:51,524
I don't drink.

57
00:05:54,472 --> 00:05:56,565
May I buy you an appetizer?

58
00:05:57,141 --> 00:05:59,371
I don't eat. I'm a model.

59
00:06:12,690 --> 00:06:14,214
How about one for the road?

60
00:06:14,292 --> 00:06:16,988
No, thanks. I have to operate tomorrow.

61
00:06:19,897 --> 00:06:21,524
Are you a doctor?

62
00:06:23,167 --> 00:06:24,759
Plastic surgeon.

63
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:55,355
<i>Bread, Rembrandt Toothpaste...</i>

64
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:58,700
<i>mayonnaise, Wolfgang Puck pizzas....</i>

65
00:07:07,044 --> 00:07:08,705
<i>I'm gonna fire the gardener.</i>

66
00:07:08,779 --> 00:07:12,681
<i>Hedges in front are lopsided.
Looks like he trimmed them drunk.</i>

67
00:07:14,285 --> 00:07:16,412
<i>Maybe Julia should fire him.</i>

68
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:18,383
<i>She's better at this sort of thing.</i>

69
00:07:31,535 --> 00:07:33,503
Are you finished, honey?

70
00:07:46,617 --> 00:07:47,675
Yes.

71
00:08:12,476 --> 00:08:14,535
Take me back to bed, Prince Charming.

72
00:08:14,612 --> 00:08:17,445
Don't you have to explain
last night to your boyfriend?

73
00:08:17,515 --> 00:08:21,451
He's not a fiancé or anything like that.
He's just a bouncer at Level.

74
00:08:21,519 --> 00:08:23,919
There are advantages
to having a bouncer boyfriend.

75
00:08:23,988 --> 00:08:26,320
You never have to
wait behind a velvet rope.

76
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:27,550
Please.

77
00:08:28,659 --> 00:08:31,253
You think a girl like me has to wait?

78
00:08:31,328 --> 00:08:33,091
Like last weekend...

79
00:08:33,164 --> 00:08:36,258
my girls and l,
we went to that new club, Rendezvous...

80
00:08:36,333 --> 00:08:38,563
and the club owner says to me:

81
00:08:38,702 --> 00:08:40,499
"Right this way, ten."

82
00:08:41,806 --> 00:08:43,330
The perfect 10.

83
00:08:44,208 --> 00:08:46,176
That's what he calls me.

84
00:08:52,383 --> 00:08:54,248
Booked any covers yet?

85
00:08:57,988 --> 00:08:59,421
I'm only 21 .

86
00:09:00,524 --> 00:09:02,253
I got lots of time.

87
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:04,525
Absolutely.

88
00:09:04,795 --> 00:09:08,629
Of course, it takes a lot of discipline
and work to get there, to be perfect.

89
00:09:08,699 --> 00:09:11,793
You fix the flaws,
you could absolutely be a 10.

90
00:09:13,504 --> 00:09:15,267
Well, what am I now?

91
00:09:16,407 --> 00:09:17,999
You're an eight.

92
00:09:18,409 --> 00:09:19,671
An eight?

93
00:09:23,214 --> 00:09:26,274
You're also 26.
You should have worn sunscreen.

94
00:09:27,651 --> 00:09:31,178
But with a light peel under the eyes,
you could look...

95
00:09:31,755 --> 00:09:32,949
twenty.

96
00:09:33,557 --> 00:09:36,458
Even so, you're a very pretty girl, Kimber.

97
00:09:46,270 --> 00:09:48,295
I don't wanna be pretty.

98
00:09:50,374 --> 00:09:52,137
I wanna be better.

99
00:09:53,744 --> 00:09:55,541
I want to be perfect.

100
00:10:00,885 --> 00:10:03,615
I haven't booked anything in two months.

101
00:10:04,088 --> 00:10:05,316
Tell me.

102
00:10:07,958 --> 00:10:10,188
All right. You got a lipstick?

103
00:10:10,661 --> 00:10:12,094
Beauty is symmetry.

104
00:10:12,163 --> 00:10:14,996
Your right eye is half a millimeter higher
than your left.

105
00:10:15,065 --> 00:10:17,158
We could fix that
with a malar augmentation.

106
00:10:17,234 --> 00:10:18,792
It's a cheekbone enhancement.

107
00:10:18,869 --> 00:10:22,066
I give you BOTOX here and here.

108
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,938
That should provide a good lift. You lrish?

109
00:10:25,009 --> 00:10:26,033
Part.

110
00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:28,271
That explains the slightly flat boxer nose.

111
00:10:28,345 --> 00:10:30,245
We could shave the cartilage...

112
00:10:30,314 --> 00:10:32,509
give you that Christy Turlington thing.

113
00:10:32,583 --> 00:10:36,178
And the breast could go one size bigger,
a low C...

114
00:10:36,253 --> 00:10:39,188
and you could finish off
with some abdominal....

115
00:10:40,224 --> 00:10:43,057
Could finish off with some abdominal lipo.

116
00:10:44,495 --> 00:10:45,894
Pretty much.

117
00:10:47,264 --> 00:10:49,960
These are your problem areas.

118
00:10:55,172 --> 00:10:57,231
Am I really this ugly?

119
00:10:59,276 --> 00:11:01,369
I was Homecoming Queen.

120
00:11:01,879 --> 00:11:03,369
Don't be upset.

121
00:11:03,447 --> 00:11:05,608
Let your shortcomings and flaws fuel you.

122
00:11:05,683 --> 00:11:09,210
Let them push you further
than you ever thought you could go.

123
00:11:09,286 --> 00:11:13,279
When you stop striving for perfection,
you might as well be dead.

124
00:11:15,593 --> 00:11:16,787
Yeah.

125
00:11:26,036 --> 00:11:27,435
Have you...

126
00:11:29,707 --> 00:11:33,040
noticed anything different?

127
00:11:33,844 --> 00:11:35,175
Like what?

128
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,812
I don't know. It's silly.

129
00:11:40,451 --> 00:11:42,885
But ever since I nursed Annie...

130
00:11:42,953 --> 00:11:45,820
I kind of feel
that my boobs are disappearing.

131
00:11:45,889 --> 00:11:48,687
Do you think I should consider something?

132
00:11:50,561 --> 00:11:53,052
Aren't you past all that stuff now?

133
00:11:54,098 --> 00:11:55,292
I forgot.

134
00:11:55,366 --> 00:11:58,995
I should just cut to the chase
and have my uterus bronzed.

135
00:11:59,169 --> 00:12:00,898
I didn't mean that.

136
00:12:01,205 --> 00:12:02,570
Let me see.

137
00:12:03,107 --> 00:12:04,734
You've seen them.

138
00:12:05,476 --> 00:12:07,205
Okay, let me see.

139
00:12:07,544 --> 00:12:09,535
Let me just see. Come on.

140
00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:23,654
For your age, gravitationally,
they're exactly where they should be.

141
00:12:27,831 --> 00:12:30,265
By the way,
I told Annie she could adopt the gerbil...

142
00:12:30,334 --> 00:12:32,495
that her kindergarten teacher's
trying to unload--

143
00:12:32,569 --> 00:12:35,538
Sean, didn't you hear me last week?

144
00:12:35,606 --> 00:12:38,803
I specifically told her
she couldn't bring it home.

145
00:12:38,876 --> 00:12:42,277
What's the big deal? It's not like a puppy.
lt makes messes in a cage.

146
00:12:42,346 --> 00:12:46,248
It's still shit, Sean.
And that's more shit for me to clean up.

147
00:12:46,383 --> 00:12:47,907
Come on, Jules.

148
00:12:47,985 --> 00:12:52,285
It's not like you're Mia Farrow
tending to 10 paraplegic kids with polio.

149
00:12:52,356 --> 00:12:53,983
You've got two...

150
00:12:54,124 --> 00:12:55,648
and a gerbil...

151
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:57,391
and a maid.

152
00:12:58,729 --> 00:13:00,321
It's manageable.

153
00:13:12,576 --> 00:13:14,476
What you reading, Matt?

154
00:13:14,545 --> 00:13:17,639
Dad, you asked him that same question
two days ago.

155
00:13:17,715 --> 00:13:21,515
Matt's reading about alligators
for his science fair project on....

156
00:13:21,585 --> 00:13:22,779
What is it again?

157
00:13:22,853 --> 00:13:25,481
On the vanishing Everglades ecosystem.

158
00:13:26,523 --> 00:13:29,356
Of course, Dad asked me
that same question two days ago...

159
00:13:29,426 --> 00:13:32,327
because Dad never listens
to anything I say.

160
00:13:32,629 --> 00:13:34,961
Alligators? Sounds interesting.

161
00:13:35,032 --> 00:13:36,397
And scary.

162
00:13:36,667 --> 00:13:38,066
Yeah, they are.

163
00:13:38,135 --> 00:13:40,467
Did you know
that at the turn of the century...

164
00:13:40,537 --> 00:13:44,337
settlers dying of starvation
used to use dead human bodies as bait...

165
00:13:44,408 --> 00:13:46,638
to lure alligators so they could eat them?

166
00:13:46,710 --> 00:13:49,804
But the funny thing is
the gators wouldn't bite. They'd attack.

167
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:51,575
Then they'd just spit the bodies out.

168
00:13:51,648 --> 00:13:53,479
Why would they spit them out?

169
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:56,451
Turns out
gators find the taste of human flesh...

170
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:57,748
sort of boring.

171
00:13:57,821 --> 00:13:59,721
But did I tell you that one time...

172
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:02,623
the settlers saw a wild boar
fall into the water...

173
00:14:02,693 --> 00:14:04,490
and the gators went berserk.

174
00:14:04,561 --> 00:14:08,292
lt turns out that pork is the gators' version
of the Big Mac or some shit.

175
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:11,925
This is not appropriate
breakfast conversation.

176
00:14:12,002 --> 00:14:13,594
And watch your mouth.

177
00:14:17,875 --> 00:14:19,934
Annie, I told you,
when you're around Daddy...

178
00:14:20,010 --> 00:14:22,535
please don't speak in a language
he doesn't understand.

179
00:14:22,613 --> 00:14:26,606
We live in South Florida, Sean.
English is the foreign language.

180
00:15:15,933 --> 00:15:18,163
Good morning to you, Mr. Sean.

181
00:15:20,037 --> 00:15:22,631
Anything extra you'd like done today?

182
00:15:25,776 --> 00:15:27,107
No, Julio.

183
00:15:27,277 --> 00:15:29,142
Keep up the good work.

184
00:15:41,859 --> 00:15:44,350
God. It's beautiful out here, huh?

185
00:15:44,628 --> 00:15:47,426
It's perfect weather for skipping school.

186
00:15:48,499 --> 00:15:51,662
I want you back by third period, Matty.
We agreed.

187
00:15:51,735 --> 00:15:54,067
Here, I wrote you a doctor's excuse.

188
00:15:54,137 --> 00:15:55,331
Thanks.

189
00:15:55,572 --> 00:15:59,269
Listen, and thanks
for the medical consultation stuff.

190
00:16:00,978 --> 00:16:03,105
When can we schedule an operation?

191
00:16:04,081 --> 00:16:06,242
Killer. Slow down.

192
00:16:06,350 --> 00:16:08,841
Like it or not,
we have to talk to your dad about this.

193
00:16:08,919 --> 00:16:11,353
You're under 18.
He has to sign the consent form.

194
00:16:11,421 --> 00:16:14,390
Yeah. He'll never go for it.
He's such an asshole.

195
00:16:15,959 --> 00:16:18,291
Don't you call your father that.

196
00:16:18,362 --> 00:16:21,058
You don't know how lucky you've got it.

197
00:16:23,867 --> 00:16:26,392
Besides, your dad is not an asshole.

198
00:16:27,738 --> 00:16:29,729
Robots can't be assholes.

199
00:16:35,679 --> 00:16:38,079
-You're gonna let me drive?
-Yeah.

200
00:16:38,248 --> 00:16:40,239
That way, I get to drink.

201
00:16:47,824 --> 00:16:49,689
This is my Joey last year.

202
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:51,728
He made the tennis team.

203
00:16:52,062 --> 00:16:55,327
-And after the accident?
-lt was no accident, okay?

204
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:59,896
I'm sorry. I'm still reeling, you know.

205
00:17:00,837 --> 00:17:03,533
Can I see the current pictures, please?

206
00:17:06,777 --> 00:17:10,440
-How many grafts has he been through?
-We had to stop at five.

207
00:17:10,514 --> 00:17:12,106
He needs three more.

208
00:17:12,382 --> 00:17:13,747
Shitty HMO.

209
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:24,226
-Miss Michaels, l'd like to help, but--
-Please don't say no.

210
00:17:24,294 --> 00:17:27,422
Can't we make some kind of
an arrangement or something?

211
00:17:27,497 --> 00:17:29,658
Like a layaway plan or something?

212
00:17:29,733 --> 00:17:32,167
Miss Michaels, it's not the money.
It's the time.

213
00:17:32,235 --> 00:17:35,033
We're booked solid
for the next six months.

214
00:17:35,105 --> 00:17:36,572
I understand.

215
00:17:40,210 --> 00:17:43,202
lf I wanted something silly or stupid...

216
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:46,374
like a goddamn boob job,
something you can make a quick buck on...

217
00:17:46,450 --> 00:17:48,816
maybe you could squeeze me in.

218
00:17:51,688 --> 00:17:55,522
Miss Michaels, I'm gonna give you
the number of Dr. Michael Lewengaard.

219
00:17:55,592 --> 00:17:56,923
Screw you!

220
00:17:58,128 --> 00:17:59,595
I already went to him.

221
00:17:59,663 --> 00:18:01,927
He blew me off,
and then he recommended you...

222
00:18:01,999 --> 00:18:03,990
and that's why I'm here.

223
00:18:08,939 --> 00:18:12,033
Congratulations on your
fancy expansion, Doctor.

224
00:18:12,376 --> 00:18:15,345
Looks like you're doing
really good for yourself.

225
00:18:19,416 --> 00:18:22,010
And thank you for your precious time.

226
00:18:30,661 --> 00:18:34,563
The next time you've got
some little size 4 on your table...

227
00:18:34,898 --> 00:18:38,629
and you're giving her liposuction
she really doesn't need...

228
00:18:39,936 --> 00:18:41,836
you think of my Joey...

229
00:18:42,939 --> 00:18:45,533
and what you could have done for him.

230
00:18:46,009 --> 00:18:47,476
Shame on you.

231
00:19:06,063 --> 00:19:07,587
So check out this bombshell.

232
00:19:07,664 --> 00:19:10,394
Julia tells me this morning
she wants her breasts done.

233
00:19:10,467 --> 00:19:13,493
lf you're thinking conflict of interest,
l'd like to volunteer.

234
00:19:13,570 --> 00:19:15,333
Still have a crush on the missis, do we?

235
00:19:15,405 --> 00:19:18,238
For the record,
l'd like it to show that I dated her first...

236
00:19:18,308 --> 00:19:21,175
-and passed off my sloppy seconds to you.
-Screw you.

237
00:19:21,244 --> 00:19:23,178
One date, and she didn't let you kiss her.

238
00:19:23,246 --> 00:19:26,545
She thought you were too smooth.
My wife's perceptive.

239
00:19:26,616 --> 00:19:29,744
You're not. A lot goes on in your family
you don't even know about.

240
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:32,050
lf my son was getting brutally razzed
at school...

241
00:19:32,122 --> 00:19:34,249
l'd have picked up
on his changed behavior.

242
00:19:34,324 --> 00:19:36,758
Matt's having trouble at school?
He told you this?

243
00:19:36,827 --> 00:19:39,159
He's torn up.
I guess he was showering in gym...

244
00:19:39,229 --> 00:19:42,130
and some tough guys were
laughing at him, calling him anteater.

245
00:19:42,199 --> 00:19:43,598
"Anteater"?

246
00:19:43,667 --> 00:19:46,192
Basically, he's self-conscious
about his dick...

247
00:19:46,269 --> 00:19:48,396
and he wants a circumcision.

248
00:19:49,539 --> 00:19:52,269
He doesn't need a circumcision.
That's a vanity operation.

249
00:19:52,342 --> 00:19:54,902
We're in the vanity business, Sean.
It's what we do.

250
00:19:54,978 --> 00:19:57,640
Appearance is everything to a kid.
It's how you fit in.

251
00:19:57,714 --> 00:20:00,114
Snip, snip, he feels better about himself...

252
00:20:00,183 --> 00:20:03,914
and you, sir, can make that happen.
How cool is fatherhood?

253
00:20:03,987 --> 00:20:07,582
I'm not doing anything to my son's penis
or my wife's breasts.

254
00:20:07,657 --> 00:20:10,455
I don't want my family
infected by what we do here.

255
00:20:10,527 --> 00:20:14,190
What else do we do here other than make
people feel better about themselves?

256
00:20:14,264 --> 00:20:17,995
What we do here is let people externalize
the hate they feel about themselves.

257
00:20:18,068 --> 00:20:20,798
Which is why I want to hire
a full-time psychologist.

258
00:20:20,871 --> 00:20:22,805
To screen people better.

259
00:20:22,873 --> 00:20:25,000
Great, and let's do yoga in the lobby.

260
00:20:25,075 --> 00:20:27,475
Since BOTOX went wide,
it's like a factory in here.

261
00:20:27,544 --> 00:20:28,943
No discernment, no caution.

262
00:20:29,012 --> 00:20:31,344
This is a business. A very good business...

263
00:20:31,414 --> 00:20:34,406
that is on the verge
of setting us up for life.

264
00:20:34,484 --> 00:20:38,011
Well, maybe I don't want to
be in this business anymore.

265
00:20:46,863 --> 00:20:49,058
Our patient's comfortably in twilight...

266
00:20:49,132 --> 00:20:51,965
ready to be carved up
like a Christmas ham.

267
00:21:02,579 --> 00:21:03,978
Let's do it.

268
00:22:10,146 --> 00:22:12,114
You're shaving too deep.

269
00:22:13,083 --> 00:22:14,414
It's fine.

270
00:22:15,318 --> 00:22:18,378
Do you want it fine,
or do you want it perfect?

271
00:22:33,703 --> 00:22:35,864
He's on morphine. There's no pain.

272
00:22:35,939 --> 00:22:38,339
He'll be up and around at the hospital
by week's end.

273
00:22:38,408 --> 00:22:39,875
Transport ambulance just arrived.

274
00:22:39,943 --> 00:22:42,673
You can ride with him
to Dade County if you want.

275
00:22:42,746 --> 00:22:44,145
What's with the mask?

276
00:22:44,214 --> 00:22:45,476
A new breakthrough.

277
00:22:45,548 --> 00:22:47,607
It's polyurethane
lined with pulse magnets.

278
00:22:47,684 --> 00:22:51,984
They bring constant rejuvenating
blood flow to the surface of the skin.

279
00:22:59,663 --> 00:23:02,063
Dr. Sean, excuse me.

280
00:23:02,465 --> 00:23:03,727
I forgot to ask.

281
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:07,634
Does the $300,000 cover everything,
or is the hospital stay extra?

282
00:23:18,248 --> 00:23:19,579
What's up?

283
00:23:19,983 --> 00:23:22,679
Where'd you hide the extra Perez money?

284
00:23:25,522 --> 00:23:28,491
You want to play accountant,
go check the corporate account.

285
00:23:28,558 --> 00:23:30,617
I'm putting that money
back into our company.

286
00:23:30,694 --> 00:23:32,093
It's drug money, isn't it?

287
00:23:32,162 --> 00:23:34,858
I don't know. I didn't ask. Neither did you.

288
00:23:34,931 --> 00:23:37,058
-Excuse me, Dr. Troy?
-Yes?

289
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:40,997
The architect is here to show you
the marble samples for the steam room.

290
00:23:41,071 --> 00:23:42,163
Steam room?

291
00:23:42,238 --> 00:23:44,900
Our recovery unit addition
now has a marble steam room?

292
00:23:44,975 --> 00:23:47,000
I didn't approve that.
I wasn't even consulted.

293
00:23:47,077 --> 00:23:49,443
That's a ridiculous,
unnecessary expenditure.

294
00:23:49,512 --> 00:23:51,104
You stay out here and moralize.

295
00:23:51,181 --> 00:23:54,275
l'd love to listen,
but I have a business to run.

296
00:24:18,541 --> 00:24:19,701
Hello.

297
00:24:20,343 --> 00:24:21,332
Hi.

298
00:24:22,178 --> 00:24:24,305
My daughter's getting married
next month.

299
00:24:24,381 --> 00:24:26,144
That's why I'm here.

300
00:24:26,716 --> 00:24:29,241
I'm gonna freshen up the eyes a bit.

301
00:24:29,419 --> 00:24:32,013
Wedding photos are forever, you know.

302
00:24:36,059 --> 00:24:37,526
Going bigger?

303
00:24:38,595 --> 00:24:40,495
Mrs. Grubman, right this....

304
00:24:41,765 --> 00:24:43,494
-Julia.
-Hi.

305
00:24:43,967 --> 00:24:46,265
To what do we owe the pleasure?

306
00:24:46,336 --> 00:24:50,102
Sean's having a professional sit-down
with Matt to talk about the....

307
00:24:50,173 --> 00:24:51,265
So I heard.

308
00:24:51,341 --> 00:24:52,672
Tough stuff.

309
00:24:52,742 --> 00:24:55,905
Seems Dr. Spock did not write
a chapter about....

310
00:24:58,214 --> 00:25:00,546
Thanks for talking to him last week.

311
00:25:00,617 --> 00:25:04,314
Everybody needs someone in their life
who'll listen, right?

312
00:25:04,821 --> 00:25:07,517
Dr. Troy, I have a 3:00 appointment.

313
00:25:08,391 --> 00:25:09,915
It's now 3:15.

314
00:25:11,261 --> 00:25:13,491
Have me over to the house
one of these days.

315
00:25:13,563 --> 00:25:15,190
I miss my family.

316
00:25:16,566 --> 00:25:18,329
Yeah, l'd like that.

317
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:21,931
So would the kids.

318
00:25:26,042 --> 00:25:29,671
And now all my attention
is turned to my favorite patient.

319
00:25:34,284 --> 00:25:36,844
I know you say that to all the girls.

320
00:25:46,463 --> 00:25:49,057
Tell me what you like about yourself.

321
00:25:49,632 --> 00:25:53,966
Look, Dad, I'm grateful
that you're treating me like an adult.

322
00:25:54,037 --> 00:25:57,438
But if we have to do this, can we
skip the psycho-mind-probe stuff?

323
00:25:57,507 --> 00:26:00,067
Your mother and l
thought a lot about this topic.

324
00:26:00,143 --> 00:26:03,704
We didn't give you a circumcision
because you were six weeks premature.

325
00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:07,773
Your little fighting body
didn't need the stress of an operation.

326
00:26:08,051 --> 00:26:09,916
I could've handled it.

327
00:26:12,889 --> 00:26:15,858
Why did you go to Christian
with your concerns instead of me?

328
00:26:15,925 --> 00:26:19,190
Because he's cooler than you,
and he listens to me.

329
00:26:19,262 --> 00:26:22,663
I don't get that "father knows best"
bullshit from him.

330
00:26:22,732 --> 00:26:24,859
He treats me like a man.

331
00:26:27,871 --> 00:26:31,602
Matt, I'm gonna make an appointment
with a psychologist.

332
00:26:31,674 --> 00:26:34,643
I apologize we don't have one
on staff here. We should.

333
00:26:34,711 --> 00:26:35,735
What? Why?

334
00:26:35,812 --> 00:26:37,677
You've never bowed
to peer pressure before.

335
00:26:37,747 --> 00:26:38,975
I think something's going on.

336
00:26:39,048 --> 00:26:41,346
Look, I just want it, okay?

337
00:26:41,417 --> 00:26:43,408
I don't want guys talking trash about me.

338
00:26:43,486 --> 00:26:46,887
Women don't like it when you're not cut.
It's the smell or something.

339
00:26:46,956 --> 00:26:49,356
Even though I keep it clean.

340
00:26:50,093 --> 00:26:52,891
So feel free to skip the hygiene lecture.

341
00:26:56,633 --> 00:26:58,828
Are you having sex with girls?

342
00:26:59,469 --> 00:27:02,438
Not with girls, Dad. With Vanessa.

343
00:27:02,605 --> 00:27:04,766
Maybe you overheard me
talking to Mom about her.

344
00:27:04,841 --> 00:27:06,103
She's beautiful.

345
00:27:06,176 --> 00:27:09,907
She's a varsity cheerleader.
She can have any guy she wants.

346
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:11,807
And she chose me.

347
00:27:13,950 --> 00:27:15,713
So you have had sex.

348
00:27:16,052 --> 00:27:19,488
It's getting there,
and I know she'll see it and hurl.

349
00:27:20,490 --> 00:27:23,323
Matt, if this girl genuinely cares
about you...

350
00:27:23,393 --> 00:27:26,328
she's not gonna care about
something as trivial as extra skin.

351
00:27:26,396 --> 00:27:30,162
Trivial? This is my life, okay?
This is not trivial.

352
00:27:32,302 --> 00:27:33,929
Look, for once...

353
00:27:36,372 --> 00:27:38,863
just give me something that I need.

354
00:27:41,978 --> 00:27:43,240
How's the patient?

355
00:27:43,313 --> 00:27:46,214
He's pissed.
All they have is vanilla ice cream.

356
00:27:46,282 --> 00:27:50,878
When our recovery spa center's done,
we'll be serving fresh fruit smoothies.

357
00:27:52,155 --> 00:27:55,147
-Where's your brother?
-He was here 10 minutes ago.

358
00:27:55,291 --> 00:27:57,225
lf you want me to do a follow-up, find him.

359
00:27:57,293 --> 00:28:00,023
l've got another appointment
in half an hour.

360
00:28:04,901 --> 00:28:07,631
Why would your brother be on this floor?

361
00:28:07,904 --> 00:28:09,201
Here, Mija.

362
00:28:09,272 --> 00:28:12,332
The ice cream will make your tonsils
feel good.

363
00:28:13,610 --> 00:28:15,407
Are you the bogeyman?

364
00:28:21,618 --> 00:28:23,643
l just wanted to give her my ice cream.

365
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:26,052
I didn't want it to go to waste.

366
00:28:55,151 --> 00:28:57,278
-You okay, sweetheart?
-Yeah.

367
00:28:57,420 --> 00:28:59,081
-You sure?
-Yes.

368
00:29:20,043 --> 00:29:21,567
During our consultation...

369
00:29:21,644 --> 00:29:24,579
your brother said
he was with the boss' girl.

370
00:29:25,815 --> 00:29:27,407
How old was she?

371
00:29:29,852 --> 00:29:31,251
She was six.

372
00:29:56,846 --> 00:29:58,871
We have a walk-in problem.

373
00:30:03,052 --> 00:30:04,917
Miss Henry, you've got to calm down.

374
00:30:04,987 --> 00:30:07,979
The contractions from your diaphragm
have split five stitches.

375
00:30:08,057 --> 00:30:11,288
ls Christian here?
I want my surgeon to do this.

376
00:30:11,361 --> 00:30:13,488
He is in the field with another patient.

377
00:30:13,563 --> 00:30:15,531
I don't understand this!

378
00:30:15,698 --> 00:30:18,565
I haven't heard from him
since my operation.

379
00:30:18,634 --> 00:30:20,795
I thought that we were gonna be together.

380
00:30:20,870 --> 00:30:23,304
I think you're confusing Dr. Troy's...

381
00:30:23,373 --> 00:30:26,308
pleasant and very thorough
bedside manner with real emotions.

382
00:30:26,376 --> 00:30:30,574
lf it's any consolation to you, honey,
you're not the first girl he's done this to.

383
00:30:30,646 --> 00:30:32,910
But at least you got
a good set of tits out of it.

384
00:30:32,982 --> 00:30:36,247
So heal in more ways than one
and just go on with your life.

385
00:30:36,319 --> 00:30:37,650
Liz, you're out of line.

386
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:39,813
No, Sean, you are out of line!

387
00:30:39,889 --> 00:30:41,584
You co-own this business!

388
00:30:41,657 --> 00:30:44,820
This reflects on you and your character!
Wake up!

389
00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:05,476
The construction workers ripped us off.

390
00:31:05,548 --> 00:31:08,415
They took your computer,
your Viagra paperweights, everything.

391
00:31:08,484 --> 00:31:10,884
We weren't ripped off, Christian!
I'm quitting!

392
00:31:10,953 --> 00:31:13,649
<i>I'm starting over before it's too late.</i>

393
00:31:14,023 --> 00:31:16,321
Are you at home?
I'm gonna come over. We can talk--

394
00:31:16,392 --> 00:31:19,054
It's my turn to talk now, Christian, okay?

395
00:31:19,128 --> 00:31:21,096
The mute finally speaks.

396
00:31:21,264 --> 00:31:22,390
So listen up!

397
00:31:22,465 --> 00:31:24,399
<i>Thank you for using your cock as a lure...</i>

398
00:31:24,467 --> 00:31:26,662
<i>to get emotionally damaged women
into our office.</i>

399
00:31:26,736 --> 00:31:28,101
<i>That's a brilliant sales ploy!</i>

400
00:31:28,171 --> 00:31:30,833
Thank you for being
so ruthlessly ambitious...

401
00:31:30,907 --> 00:31:34,707
that you would gladly accept drug money.
A business transaction, by the way...

402
00:31:34,777 --> 00:31:36,642
<i>that could lead the Feds to our front door.</i>

403
00:31:36,712 --> 00:31:38,509
Maybe you wanna
have your license revoked.

404
00:31:38,581 --> 00:31:41,311
Spend your 40s taking it up the ass
in prison, but I do not!

405
00:31:41,384 --> 00:31:42,442
I'm losing you.

406
00:31:42,518 --> 00:31:45,487
Do not hang up on me!
I'm just getting started!

407
00:31:45,555 --> 00:31:47,614
<i>Thank you for becoming
so repugnant to me...</i>

408
00:31:47,690 --> 00:31:50,488
that I'm finally taking charge of my life.

409
00:31:50,693 --> 00:31:51,785
What are you gonna do?

410
00:31:51,861 --> 00:31:54,989
For 10 years, l've been consumed
with transforming other people.

411
00:31:55,064 --> 00:31:57,794
Starting today, I'm transforming myself!

412
00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:11,510
<i>ls it on? Okay, it's on.</i>

413
00:32:11,614 --> 00:32:14,412
<i>Christian, tell our viewing audience
what we're doing here...</i>

414
00:32:14,484 --> 00:32:17,647
<i>on the night of August 25, 1987.</i>

415
00:32:22,592 --> 00:32:25,117
<i>It's a momentous night.</i>

416
00:32:25,194 --> 00:32:29,654
<i>We're getting your fiancé high
for the first time ever.</i>

417
00:32:29,732 --> 00:32:32,792
<i>And we're scrounging
to pay for the overdue electricity bill.</i>

418
00:32:32,869 --> 00:32:34,359
<i>See Sean count.</i>

419
00:32:34,437 --> 00:32:36,302
<i>See Sean eat government cheese.</i>

420
00:32:36,372 --> 00:32:39,432
<i>Okay, well, this is our
one and only videotape.</i>

421
00:32:39,509 --> 00:32:42,103
<i>Let's tell our audience
what all this hard work...</i>

422
00:32:42,178 --> 00:32:45,147
<i>and eating Ramen noodles 24/7,
has been about.</i>

423
00:32:45,214 --> 00:32:48,581
<i>Christian, what do you want
out of your life?</i>

424
00:32:49,185 --> 00:32:50,584
<i>What I want...</i>

425
00:32:52,054 --> 00:32:54,579
<i>is a girl like Julia.</i>

426
00:32:58,995 --> 00:33:01,190
<i>And a kick-ass practice with Sean...</i>

427
00:33:01,264 --> 00:33:05,257
<i>where we make women
feel better about themselves.</i>

428
00:33:05,334 --> 00:33:06,562
<i>My specialty.</i>

429
00:33:06,636 --> 00:33:08,831
<i>Well, we've certainly witnessed that.</i>

430
00:33:08,905 --> 00:33:11,533
<i>Sean, what do you want?</i>

431
00:33:14,176 --> 00:33:15,541
<i>I want you.</i>

432
00:33:17,313 --> 00:33:21,374
<i>I wanna make people's lives better.
I wanna make a difference.</i>

433
00:33:22,418 --> 00:33:24,716
<i>Jules, give me the camera.</i>

434
00:33:24,787 --> 00:33:26,345
<i>No!</i>

435
00:33:28,057 --> 00:33:29,991
<i>-Get over there.
-I'm fat.</i>

436
00:33:30,059 --> 00:33:32,050
<i>-Get over there.
-Not like this.</i>

437
00:33:32,128 --> 00:33:33,857
<i>You look beautiful.</i>

438
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:39,665
<i>I feel silly. Gosh!</i>

439
00:33:39,735 --> 00:33:40,793
<i>-Jules?
-Yeah.</i>

440
00:33:40,870 --> 00:33:43,304
<i>-What do you want?
-What do I want?</i>

441
00:33:56,252 --> 00:33:58,948
I'm sorry, sweetheart.
I presumed you knew.

442
00:33:59,021 --> 00:34:02,582
Liz told me he was setting up shop
next to some fungus-ridden nail salon...

443
00:34:02,658 --> 00:34:05,092
before she quit
and left me with no anesthesiologist.

444
00:34:05,161 --> 00:34:06,219
Why?

445
00:34:07,196 --> 00:34:09,858
I think our boy's having a midlife crisis.

446
00:34:09,932 --> 00:34:13,060
lf I find him screwing around,
you have my word, I will kill him.

447
00:34:13,135 --> 00:34:15,501
You think he's having an affair?

448
00:34:15,571 --> 00:34:17,300
That was out of line.

449
00:34:17,373 --> 00:34:19,568
I'm sure he's not. I mean....

450
00:34:19,742 --> 00:34:23,234
You guys have always had a hot time
between the sheets, right?

451
00:34:23,312 --> 00:34:24,939
He told you that?

452
00:34:25,247 --> 00:34:27,340
Used to tell me everything.

453
00:34:33,889 --> 00:34:35,618
I miss him.

454
00:34:36,792 --> 00:34:38,384
I miss him, too.

455
00:34:42,999 --> 00:34:46,628
Have you seen the thing for the thingy?
I can't find it.

456
00:34:47,370 --> 00:34:49,270
-ls that new art?
-What?

457
00:34:50,773 --> 00:34:52,365
No, I'm just....

458
00:34:52,608 --> 00:34:54,701
I was watching an old tape.

459
00:34:55,044 --> 00:34:57,774
To see how much
your breasts have changed?

460
00:34:58,314 --> 00:35:01,078
lsn't that why you changed your hair,
why you want implants?

461
00:35:01,150 --> 00:35:05,450
So that he'll notice you, want you again,
like he did when we were young?

462
00:35:08,924 --> 00:35:11,825
I just asked him
if he thought I needed them.

463
00:35:13,362 --> 00:35:15,762
So he could tell you you didn't?

464
00:35:17,433 --> 00:35:20,095
You didn't get the response you wanted?

465
00:35:20,169 --> 00:35:21,193
No.

466
00:35:26,075 --> 00:35:28,305
-Let me see them.
-What?

467
00:35:29,045 --> 00:35:33,038
I'm a doctor, Julia.
I do over 300 breast augmentations a year.

468
00:35:33,683 --> 00:35:36,311
More than double the number Sean does.

469
00:35:38,154 --> 00:35:39,815
I'll be objective.

470
00:35:46,162 --> 00:35:47,754
Let me see them.

471
00:36:24,333 --> 00:36:26,096
Symmetry is perfect.

472
00:36:29,905 --> 00:36:34,035
Sagging's minimal, despite two
rigorous sessions of breast-feeding.

473
00:36:37,346 --> 00:36:39,075
Tone is immaculate.

474
00:36:47,089 --> 00:36:48,954
How's the sensitivity?

475
00:36:52,495 --> 00:36:53,587
Fine.

476
00:36:57,900 --> 00:37:00,164
I can't recommend surgery, Julia.

477
00:37:00,703 --> 00:37:02,295
Your breasts...

478
00:37:05,241 --> 00:37:06,640
are perfect.

479
00:37:07,376 --> 00:37:08,900
-Mom?
-Yeah?

480
00:37:09,178 --> 00:37:10,577
Uncle Chris!

481
00:37:13,449 --> 00:37:16,179
Look at my new gerbil.
I named him Frisky.

482
00:37:17,987 --> 00:37:21,013
Put him down.
I want you to give me a big hug.

483
00:37:26,128 --> 00:37:29,256
Come here. Let me look at you.

484
00:37:30,466 --> 00:37:31,694
Oh, God.

485
00:37:38,507 --> 00:37:41,476
I don't want Annie
to have to go to public school, Julia.

486
00:37:41,544 --> 00:37:44,377
You have to talk to him.
He listens to you. He always has.

487
00:37:44,446 --> 00:37:46,175
You're his compass.

488
00:37:48,384 --> 00:37:51,046
<i>Well, I want a family...</i>

489
00:37:54,123 --> 00:37:57,286
<i>and I wanna go back to school
and be a pediatrician...</i>

490
00:37:57,359 --> 00:38:00,192
<i>once you guys
get the business established.</i>

491
00:38:01,564 --> 00:38:03,532
<i>I just wanna be happy.</i>

492
00:38:16,445 --> 00:38:17,503
Jesus!

493
00:38:17,580 --> 00:38:20,174
Mr. Sean, I did not see you, sir.

494
00:38:37,666 --> 00:38:40,567
You need to hire another gardener.
I just fired Julio.

495
00:38:40,636 --> 00:38:43,104
No, Sean, you need to hire
another gardener.

496
00:38:43,172 --> 00:38:45,504
lt took me two years to find somebody...

497
00:38:45,574 --> 00:38:49,567
who would actually show up every week,
and clean the pool filter.

498
00:38:49,912 --> 00:38:52,881
Next to giving birth,
it's the most difficult thing l've done.

499
00:38:52,948 --> 00:38:54,609
It's your problem.

500
00:38:56,352 --> 00:38:57,819
We have mice.

501
00:38:58,487 --> 00:39:00,887
That's not a mouse, Sean.
That's Frisky the gerbil.

502
00:39:00,956 --> 00:39:03,789
-lt escaped from its cage.
-Did you try and catch it?

503
00:39:03,859 --> 00:39:06,885
I would have, but I was too busy
cleaning up the trail of shit...

504
00:39:06,962 --> 00:39:08,725
it left everywhere.

505
00:39:09,798 --> 00:39:11,493
Okay, what is wrong with you?

506
00:39:11,567 --> 00:39:13,535
You take me for granted.

507
00:39:14,169 --> 00:39:16,000
Did you think I wouldn't find out?

508
00:39:16,071 --> 00:39:19,507
What are you doing, Sean?
When were you gonna tell me?

509
00:39:21,510 --> 00:39:23,239
I was waiting for the right moment.

510
00:39:23,312 --> 00:39:25,473
How about last week
when you screwed me...

511
00:39:25,547 --> 00:39:29,108
but wouldn't kiss me?
We could have talked about it then.

512
00:39:31,453 --> 00:39:33,819
This is the right thing for me.

513
00:39:33,889 --> 00:39:36,153
l've wanted to do pro bono work
for a while now.

514
00:39:36,225 --> 00:39:37,692
I'm gonna do that.

515
00:39:37,793 --> 00:39:40,227
I saw this boy the other day.
He's horribly burned.

516
00:39:40,296 --> 00:39:44,289
I want to spend my time and my talent
working on people like him.

517
00:39:45,701 --> 00:39:48,101
Liz is coming. I mean, she also--

518
00:39:49,638 --> 00:39:51,731
What the hell is it
with people in this house...

519
00:39:51,807 --> 00:39:52,865
throwing things at my head?

520
00:39:52,942 --> 00:39:55,410
Finally, some passion! Congratulations!

521
00:39:55,477 --> 00:39:57,707
You're not bloodless after all!

522
00:39:57,780 --> 00:40:01,011
Do you know how long it has been
since I have heard you laugh?

523
00:40:01,083 --> 00:40:04,280
Since I have seen you
be emotional about anything?

524
00:40:05,821 --> 00:40:06,913
Jesus, Sean.

525
00:40:06,989 --> 00:40:09,617
I haven't seen you cry
since Matt was born.

526
00:40:09,692 --> 00:40:12,490
I'm not gonna apologize for that.
I'm a surgeon.

527
00:40:12,561 --> 00:40:14,358
lf I get emotional, patients die.

528
00:40:14,430 --> 00:40:17,627
I'm not one of your patients, Sean!
I'm your wife!

529
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:20,061
And on your watch, a death has occurred...

530
00:40:20,135 --> 00:40:22,103
the death of you and me.

531
00:40:22,204 --> 00:40:25,367
This marriage doesn't even
have a pulse anymore.

532
00:40:31,747 --> 00:40:33,146
I know that.

533
00:40:33,816 --> 00:40:35,716
And I'm sad about that.

534
00:40:37,686 --> 00:40:40,382
Jules, I realize
that we do need to fix something...

535
00:40:40,456 --> 00:40:43,391
and it's not your breasts.
We need to fix us.

536
00:40:43,492 --> 00:40:46,950
I want us to be like we used to be.
We had parity, equality--

537
00:40:47,029 --> 00:40:50,658
How can we have equality
when you don't even respect me enough...

538
00:40:50,733 --> 00:40:53,930
to, at the very least,
tell me you're thinking of walking away...

539
00:40:54,003 --> 00:40:56,403
from everything
we've sacrificed our lives for?

540
00:40:56,472 --> 00:40:59,066
-Are we being completely honest?
-Yes.

541
00:41:00,709 --> 00:41:03,610
I guess I don't respect you like I used to.

542
00:41:08,350 --> 00:41:10,910
Finally. Floodgates open.

543
00:41:10,986 --> 00:41:13,386
What do you do with your days, Julia?

544
00:41:13,455 --> 00:41:14,513
You shop.

545
00:41:14,590 --> 00:41:17,184
You get your vagina waxed
like some porn starlet.

546
00:41:17,259 --> 00:41:19,124
You go to lunch with your girlfriends.

547
00:41:19,194 --> 00:41:21,594
Sorry, that seems like easy street to me.

548
00:41:21,663 --> 00:41:24,131
Yet when I come home, you're stone.

549
00:41:24,199 --> 00:41:25,564
You don't show me any respect...

550
00:41:25,634 --> 00:41:28,967
even though I think the life l've given you
is pretty goddamn sweet!

551
00:41:29,038 --> 00:41:32,906
You gave me nothing!
I made this life with you.

552
00:41:35,944 --> 00:41:37,935
Did you think this is what I wanted...

553
00:41:38,013 --> 00:41:41,608
<i>to be some Stepford doctor's wife?
It's not.</i>

554
00:41:41,683 --> 00:41:44,948
Then change your life!
Change it like I'm changing mine.

555
00:41:45,020 --> 00:41:48,012
This isn't change, Sean. This is a whim.

556
00:41:48,524 --> 00:41:51,084
You want change? How about my change?

557
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:54,618
How about me going back to college
and getting my doctor's degree...

558
00:41:54,696 --> 00:41:57,256
when Annie goes back to school
next year?

559
00:41:58,033 --> 00:42:01,935
That's my change. The change
we've talked about for the last 10 years.

560
00:42:02,337 --> 00:42:04,771
Apparently you've forgotten about that.

561
00:42:07,276 --> 00:42:10,939
lf you think
that I am gonna go back to the bottom...

562
00:42:11,013 --> 00:42:15,279
and work two part-time jobs
and settle my dream again...

563
00:42:15,751 --> 00:42:19,278
so you can whistle your way through
a midlife crisis...

564
00:42:19,688 --> 00:42:21,679
you're horribly mistaken.

565
00:42:28,864 --> 00:42:30,058
My God.

566
00:42:31,333 --> 00:42:34,791
When was the last time we went to bed
that you didn't hate me?

567
00:43:36,098 --> 00:43:39,397
So I hear your marriage
jumped the shark last week.

568
00:43:40,435 --> 00:43:41,959
My condolences.

569
00:43:48,377 --> 00:43:49,810
It's a nice place.

570
00:43:50,078 --> 00:43:53,980
Put a Nagel print up on the wall
and you're right back to where we started.

571
00:43:54,049 --> 00:43:56,916
-Christian, I'm not coming back.
-Yes, you are.

572
00:43:56,985 --> 00:44:00,853
We worked too hard to get here.
Although you won't admit it, you need me.

573
00:44:00,923 --> 00:44:05,189
Just like I need you. I'm the salesman,
the planner. You're the talent. We fit.

574
00:44:05,527 --> 00:44:08,587
-We always have.
-You'll do fine without me, Christian.

575
00:44:08,664 --> 00:44:11,155
With your corner
on the placebo surgery market...

576
00:44:11,233 --> 00:44:13,497
you could easily find another partner.

577
00:44:24,046 --> 00:44:26,810
You think a big change like this
will be easy?

578
00:44:26,982 --> 00:44:30,281
lt will not. You want a change? Great.
Do the nip-and-tuck route.

579
00:44:30,352 --> 00:44:33,879
Subtle, imperceptible shifts. lsn't that
what you recommend to patients?

580
00:44:33,956 --> 00:44:36,948
But don't think that you have
the time or the patience...

581
00:44:37,025 --> 00:44:38,686
for an entire life lift.

582
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:40,660
We're not 27 anymore. We're 40.

583
00:44:40,729 --> 00:44:42,993
Brother, we're on the cusp
of the American dream.

584
00:44:43,065 --> 00:44:44,930
It's not my dream anymore.

585
00:44:54,076 --> 00:44:56,874
Here. You left this
when you were cleaning out your office.

586
00:44:56,945 --> 00:45:00,039
The first dollar we ever made.
It's romantic, isn't it?

587
00:45:07,322 --> 00:45:09,813
I'll be keeping this
as part of our settlement.

588
00:45:09,891 --> 00:45:12,451
-What are you saying?
-You signed a contract with me.

589
00:45:12,527 --> 00:45:15,257
A corporation contract,
and if you forgot, it stipulates...

590
00:45:15,330 --> 00:45:18,458
that if the corporation is dissolved,
which I see now that it is...

591
00:45:18,533 --> 00:45:21,093
the disbanding partner
has to buy the other partner out.

592
00:45:21,169 --> 00:45:24,570
-I don't want anything but a clean start.
-Tough shit. You pay up.

593
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:27,575
You've got one week,
or I hire a lawyer and freeze your assets.

594
00:45:27,643 --> 00:45:30,908
Then I come after your home,
your pension, maybe Matt's college fund.

595
00:45:30,979 --> 00:45:32,640
-You wouldn't--
-Try me!

596
00:46:09,151 --> 00:46:11,176
Get a decent carpet in here.

597
00:46:15,023 --> 00:46:17,389
Silvio Perez is scheduled
to be released today.

598
00:46:17,459 --> 00:46:19,256
You need to sign him out.

599
00:46:20,562 --> 00:46:21,790
Let him rot.

600
00:46:42,384 --> 00:46:43,612
Oh, God.

601
00:46:47,122 --> 00:46:50,421
Mom, I'm going to go to Vanessa's
after school, okay?

602
00:46:50,492 --> 00:46:54,394
No, Matt, you're not.
I need you to clean out the pool.

603
00:46:54,463 --> 00:46:57,694
-But, Mom, I can do that when l--
-No, Matt, you're not!

604
00:46:58,467 --> 00:47:02,733
I need you to clean out the pool.
I'm sick of doing everything around here.

605
00:47:08,877 --> 00:47:09,969
Okay.

606
00:47:27,696 --> 00:47:31,928
I am not gonna
clean up your shit anymore!

607
00:47:35,036 --> 00:47:36,264
Oh, God.

608
00:48:35,997 --> 00:48:37,487
Yes, Mr. Troy?

609
00:48:37,833 --> 00:48:39,323
Get over here.

610
00:49:15,470 --> 00:49:18,462
Bring the good stuff?
And it had better be good.

611
00:49:18,540 --> 00:49:22,704
-We're paying you $1,000 a girl.
-This is the best there is, ladies.

612
00:49:22,978 --> 00:49:26,175
Where's your partner?
I said I wanted two doctors.

613
00:49:26,848 --> 00:49:28,577
There are 10 girls here.

614
00:49:29,150 --> 00:49:30,947
l've done 10 women before.

615
00:49:33,288 --> 00:49:35,756
I hate to do this up-front, Celia, but....

616
00:49:37,859 --> 00:49:40,794
-You act like this is a drug deal.
-lt is.

617
00:49:44,533 --> 00:49:46,501
Let's see how you're healing.

618
00:49:58,580 --> 00:49:59,911
Very nice.

619
00:50:03,018 --> 00:50:04,883
Would you like to see?

620
00:50:21,703 --> 00:50:24,228
-What did he say?
-Good job.

621
00:50:26,107 --> 00:50:29,975
The swelling is minimal.
You're fine to travel. I'll go sign you out.

622
00:50:30,312 --> 00:50:33,509
Dr. McNamara, my brother has a question.

623
00:50:33,582 --> 00:50:34,674
What?

624
00:50:34,749 --> 00:50:39,049
Can you transform his waistline
later today, like you did his face?

625
00:50:40,188 --> 00:50:41,985
We'll pay you $2,000.

626
00:50:44,392 --> 00:50:46,257
I'm just setting up a new practice.

627
00:50:46,328 --> 00:50:48,853
I'm not completely equipped
for surgery yet.

628
00:50:49,431 --> 00:50:52,594
He wants a new waist?
Tell him to knock off the Cheetos.

629
00:50:53,802 --> 00:50:56,532
How about $20,000? Cash.

630
00:50:58,239 --> 00:51:01,072
Money like that
will certainly come in handy...

631
00:51:01,409 --> 00:51:04,708
for a businessman starting from scratch.

632
00:51:07,248 --> 00:51:08,237
No?

633
00:51:18,593 --> 00:51:21,255
-How did you hear about me?
-Word of mouth.

634
00:51:22,430 --> 00:51:25,160
-Don't lay flat for four hours.
-English?

635
00:51:25,900 --> 00:51:28,300
Tomorrow you'll be one hot bitch.

636
00:51:31,373 --> 00:51:32,397
Hold on.

637
00:51:36,044 --> 00:51:37,477
You mean hotter.

638
00:51:37,779 --> 00:51:39,838
l've one more girlfriend waiting to see you.

639
00:51:39,914 --> 00:51:41,074
Send her in.

640
00:52:04,105 --> 00:52:05,367
Dr. Troy.

641
00:52:08,376 --> 00:52:10,241
Allow me to introduce myself.

642
00:52:10,311 --> 00:52:13,144
I'm Escobar Gallardo, Celia's boyfriend.

643
00:52:16,117 --> 00:52:19,450
I'm also the former boss of Silvio Perez.

644
00:53:09,104 --> 00:53:12,096
-Didn't know you smoked.
-Neither did l.

645
00:53:14,676 --> 00:53:17,702
-What are you doing here?
-Thinking.

646
00:53:20,081 --> 00:53:23,573
-Thinking about what?
-lf I should go through with something.

647
00:53:23,752 --> 00:53:25,515
What's stopping you?

648
00:53:26,554 --> 00:53:27,816
Honestly?

649
00:53:29,124 --> 00:53:31,319
What you would think of me if I did.

650
00:53:35,864 --> 00:53:39,425
Well, don't let me stop you, Dad.
You go ahead and do it.

651
00:53:40,268 --> 00:53:43,704
Almost all my friends' parents
are divorced. Life goes on.

652
00:53:43,938 --> 00:53:46,099
Your mom and I aren't getting divorced.

653
00:53:46,174 --> 00:53:49,473
We're just taking some time apart.

654
00:53:52,113 --> 00:53:54,741
I was contemplating
a work-related matter.

655
00:54:09,964 --> 00:54:11,829
Speaking of work, come on.

656
00:54:12,333 --> 00:54:14,995
Since you fired Julio,
Mom's making me sweep the pool.

657
00:54:15,069 --> 00:54:18,732
I shouldn't have to clean up
after your mistakes alone, right?

658
00:54:28,349 --> 00:54:32,479
l've been gentle with you, my friend.
I'm going to ask you one more time.

659
00:54:32,921 --> 00:54:35,446
I know you operated on Silvio Perez.

660
00:54:35,523 --> 00:54:37,047
You don't know shit!

661
00:54:48,837 --> 00:54:52,739
We checked around town.
Your colleagues all turned Silvio down.

662
00:54:53,074 --> 00:54:55,008
But you were repeatedly mentioned...

663
00:54:55,076 --> 00:54:57,772
by your colleagues
as someone lacking ethics.

664
00:54:57,912 --> 00:55:01,370
Someone who would take
a child molester on as a client.

665
00:55:02,750 --> 00:55:05,275
Silvio stole that money!

666
00:55:08,289 --> 00:55:10,689
He stole my daughter's innocence.

667
00:55:14,095 --> 00:55:16,689
You can understand my lack of patience.

668
00:55:19,634 --> 00:55:22,865
He's in Dade County,
under the name of Cordova.

669
00:55:31,813 --> 00:55:34,475
Alejandro, you're not allowed
to be in here.

670
00:55:34,883 --> 00:55:37,681
My brother's very nervous
this time, Doctor.

671
00:55:38,286 --> 00:55:41,551
This room is not as soothing to him
as the other one was.

672
00:55:42,190 --> 00:55:45,057
He misses the plants, the art on the walls.

673
00:55:45,126 --> 00:55:48,220
-lt was very comforting.
-So what do you want me to do?

674
00:55:48,496 --> 00:55:50,896
To let me sit in and be with him.

675
00:55:51,132 --> 00:55:53,999
l've always been the one
who could calm him down.

676
00:55:54,235 --> 00:55:56,897
Look, if I'm there, he will be fine.

677
00:55:57,005 --> 00:55:59,997
And I have no problem
with the sight of blood.

678
00:56:00,275 --> 00:56:01,606
Sorry, no.

679
00:56:03,912 --> 00:56:06,039
We'll give you $5,000 extra.

680
00:56:14,622 --> 00:56:16,522
Alejandro, put on your mask.

681
00:56:34,175 --> 00:56:36,837
Dr. Troy, why didn't your partner
come with you today?

682
00:56:36,911 --> 00:56:39,345
I was looking forward to meeting him.

683
00:56:39,414 --> 00:56:41,882
He's in San Francisco
at an AMA convention.

684
00:56:42,450 --> 00:56:43,678
Question:

685
00:56:43,751 --> 00:56:46,549
Are there any side effects to the drug...

686
00:56:47,722 --> 00:56:49,952
you pumped into my girlfriend's face?

687
00:56:52,427 --> 00:56:54,224
-This BOTOX shit.
-No.

688
00:56:55,129 --> 00:56:58,223
BOTOX is a purified serum
from the botulism toxin.

689
00:56:58,299 --> 00:57:00,199
It's FDA approved. It's completely safe.

690
00:57:00,268 --> 00:57:02,930
Then why after you gave
my girlfriend BOTOX...

691
00:57:03,004 --> 00:57:05,734
did you tell her not to lie down
for four hours?

692
00:57:05,807 --> 00:57:08,139
-We tell all patients that.
-Why?

693
00:57:21,289 --> 00:57:24,190
BOTOX works by paralyzing the muscles...

694
00:57:24,592 --> 00:57:28,289
such as the forehead,
which controls wrinkles, frown lines.

695
00:57:29,130 --> 00:57:31,758
lf you were to lay flat,
there's a possibility...

696
00:57:31,833 --> 00:57:34,961
it could drift to areas
you don't want paralyzed. Like cheeks.

697
00:57:35,036 --> 00:57:36,526
Why would that be a problem?

698
00:57:36,604 --> 00:57:40,165
Those muscles monitor salivary control,
speech motor pattern.

699
00:57:40,241 --> 00:57:41,833
lf the BOTOX drifts there...

700
00:57:41,909 --> 00:57:45,106
you'd look like a stroke victim
till the drug wore off.

701
00:57:45,179 --> 00:57:48,546
-How long does that take?
-Up to two months in some cases.

702
00:57:48,616 --> 00:57:52,245
That's why I told Celia not to lie down.
I was looking out for her.

703
00:57:55,890 --> 00:57:58,825
lnteresting. That's very sweet of you.

704
00:58:04,665 --> 00:58:07,225
Why are you protecting a child molester?

705
00:58:07,869 --> 00:58:09,097
Answer me!

706
00:58:10,204 --> 00:58:14,163
Why are you protecting a child molester?

707
00:58:15,676 --> 00:58:17,701
Your partner isn't in San Francisco.

708
00:58:17,779 --> 00:58:20,942
He checked Silvio Perez
out of the hospital four hours ago.

709
00:58:21,015 --> 00:58:24,348
They left together. Where did they go?

710
00:58:25,720 --> 00:58:27,187
I don't know!

711
00:58:27,255 --> 00:58:29,883
You don't know? Well, know this.

712
00:58:41,936 --> 00:58:43,403
Alejandro, sit down.

713
00:58:43,471 --> 00:58:45,234
Wake him up.

714
00:58:49,377 --> 00:58:51,208
Your brother's gonna be fine.

715
00:58:51,279 --> 00:58:53,941
Wake him up,
or I'm gonna shoot both of you.

716
00:58:55,650 --> 00:58:58,915
-lf I bring him out too soon, he could die.
-Do it!

717
00:59:03,724 --> 00:59:05,555
At 80, he's conscious.

718
00:59:07,261 --> 00:59:10,458
Okay, stop. Come on, move!

719
00:59:14,635 --> 00:59:15,795
Get back.

720
00:59:24,512 --> 00:59:27,675
Silvio, listen. I have good news.

721
00:59:27,748 --> 00:59:29,306
I found out....

722
00:59:30,218 --> 00:59:33,085
Today I was told
that my girlfriend is pregnant.

723
00:59:34,655 --> 00:59:37,715
We're gonna have a daughter.
She's four months.

724
00:59:37,992 --> 00:59:39,482
That's good, right?

725
00:59:41,929 --> 00:59:44,420
You'll never see my daughter.

726
00:59:46,234 --> 00:59:47,861
I cannot risk it.

727
00:59:51,005 --> 00:59:52,404
You're sick.

728
00:59:55,243 --> 00:59:58,337
You have shamed our family
for the last time.

729
01:00:02,650 --> 01:00:04,413
I only wanted you...

730
01:00:05,653 --> 01:00:08,349
to know this so you would understand...

731
01:00:08,422 --> 01:00:10,822
and you would forgive me, please.

732
01:00:26,040 --> 01:00:27,701
Goodbye, my brother.

733
01:00:28,676 --> 01:00:30,303
Stop it. You'll kill him !

734
01:00:30,378 --> 01:00:34,075
It's like that, or with a bullet
to the temple! You choose!

735
01:00:39,820 --> 01:00:42,015
One more BOTOX shot, Dr. Troy.

736
01:00:44,192 --> 01:00:46,092
What should we paralyze next?

737
01:00:47,228 --> 01:00:48,820
One last chance.

738
01:00:49,163 --> 01:00:52,894
Your partner didn't go back to your office.
Where did he go?

739
01:01:07,615 --> 01:01:09,344
That looks painful, man.

740
01:01:12,620 --> 01:01:13,780
Wait here.

741
01:01:16,724 --> 01:01:19,522
It's your partner.
I think we'll take this call.

742
01:01:19,994 --> 01:01:21,154
Hello.

743
01:01:22,830 --> 01:01:25,424
I'm sorry.
Dr. Troy is not available right now.

744
01:01:25,499 --> 01:01:26,989
Sean, hang up!

745
01:01:28,269 --> 01:01:31,102
Dr. McNamara, tell you what.

746
01:01:32,139 --> 01:01:34,505
I'll let you speak to your partner...

747
01:01:34,875 --> 01:01:38,936
if you tell me where Silvio Perez is.

748
01:02:07,575 --> 01:02:09,042
Jesus Christ.

749
01:02:12,313 --> 01:02:13,803
What happened?

750
01:02:14,749 --> 01:02:16,376
I killed my brother.

751
01:02:19,220 --> 01:02:21,120
I have a daughter, too.

752
01:02:24,258 --> 01:02:26,726
You chose the right family, Alejandro.

753
01:02:28,329 --> 01:02:29,591
Let's go.

754
01:02:36,003 --> 01:02:39,097
Wait! What are we supposed to do
with this body?

755
01:02:39,273 --> 01:02:40,865
That's your problem.

756
01:02:52,353 --> 01:02:53,445
Shit!

757
01:02:55,956 --> 01:02:57,150
We have to go to the police.

758
01:02:57,224 --> 01:02:59,954
They'll believe us, right, Christian? Please.

759
01:03:00,027 --> 01:03:02,052
This guy died of an anesthesia overdose.

760
01:03:02,129 --> 01:03:04,290
It's shoddy medical practice
any way you cut it.

761
01:03:04,365 --> 01:03:06,697
I'll lose my medical license. So will Liz.

762
01:03:08,069 --> 01:03:10,663
No. I am not going down for this.

763
01:03:10,738 --> 01:03:15,107
I am not gonna have my entire life
destroyed because you two screwed up!

764
01:03:15,743 --> 01:03:17,005
Fix this!

765
01:03:31,192 --> 01:03:32,682
So what do we do?

766
01:03:55,249 --> 01:03:58,218
-Are you having a stroke?
-BOTOX is kicking in.

767
01:03:58,319 --> 01:04:00,879
Ten shots, all in muscles
and motor control sites.

768
01:04:00,955 --> 01:04:03,014
I'm gonna look like Kirk Douglas.

769
01:04:03,090 --> 01:04:04,717
Why'd they give you the shots?

770
01:04:04,792 --> 01:04:07,158
Because I couldn't tell them
where Silvio was.

771
01:04:07,228 --> 01:04:09,753
Because I wouldn't tell them
where you were.

772
01:04:11,265 --> 01:04:14,393
Do you mind telling me
why we bought 12 goddamn hams?

773
01:04:15,202 --> 01:04:17,534
Because alligators are finicky eaters.

774
01:04:36,891 --> 01:04:39,917
Hopefully, they're gonna get confused
and eat everything.

775
01:04:39,994 --> 01:04:42,258
Then there won't be any trace left.

776
01:04:46,834 --> 01:04:47,926
What?

777
01:04:49,069 --> 01:04:50,730
I was just thinking...

778
01:04:50,805 --> 01:04:54,241
how I used to do the same thing
with Matt when he was little.

779
01:04:54,775 --> 01:04:57,073
Hide the peas in his mashed potatoes.

780
01:05:02,683 --> 01:05:04,207
I didn't know, Sean.

781
01:05:06,220 --> 01:05:08,814
When I booked the job, I didn't know.

782
01:05:10,624 --> 01:05:13,718
I would never work on someone
who could hurt our Annie.

783
01:05:15,262 --> 01:05:16,422
Never.

784
01:05:17,865 --> 01:05:19,662
I need to believe that.

785
01:05:26,807 --> 01:05:30,504
I think we should hire
a full-time psychologist to screen better.

786
01:05:32,513 --> 01:05:36,142
And I want 20% of our client base
to be pro bono from now on.

787
01:05:39,386 --> 01:05:41,149
Let's clean out the trunk.

788
01:06:07,147 --> 01:06:10,139
You're a little too good at this.
You're scaring me.

789
01:06:10,384 --> 01:06:13,080
Good. It's good you're scared of me.

790
01:06:38,879 --> 01:06:39,868
Rip youyoup
