1
00:00:10,162 --> 00:00:11,891
<i>Previously on Nip / Tuck:</i>

2
00:00:13,799 --> 00:00:15,892
-I'm turning us in.
-No, you are not, Henry.

3
00:00:15,968 --> 00:00:17,936
I did this to you, Cara.

4
00:00:18,003 --> 00:00:20,301
<i>-Did you have an affair with her?
-Yes.</i>

5
00:00:20,372 --> 00:00:22,340
I can't lose you, too, Julia.

6
00:00:22,408 --> 00:00:24,774
We lost each other a long time ago, Sean.

7
00:00:24,843 --> 00:00:26,276
What is my last name, asshole?

8
00:00:26,845 --> 00:00:30,076
You never even asked me.
Not even after you screwed me.

9
00:00:31,517 --> 00:00:35,510
Trash my goddamn car one more time,
and I will trash you!

10
00:00:38,023 --> 00:00:41,254
Ms. Caine, tell me
what you don't like about yourself.

11
00:00:41,327 --> 00:00:42,692
My tankles.

12
00:00:42,995 --> 00:00:44,428
Your ankles.

13
00:00:45,264 --> 00:00:48,597
lf they were just ankles,
I wouldn't be here. Tankles.

14
00:00:48,667 --> 00:00:51,727
I must have missed anatomy class
the day they covered that.

15
00:00:51,804 --> 00:00:53,533
Tank ankles.

16
00:00:54,006 --> 00:00:57,498
Or cankles,
as in combination ankles and calves.

17
00:00:57,576 --> 00:00:59,567
Also known as piano legs.

18
00:00:59,912 --> 00:01:01,345
You'd like them shapelier?

19
00:01:01,413 --> 00:01:02,402
l'd like them to look...

20
00:01:02,481 --> 00:01:06,212
as if they weren't capable
of supporting a suspension bridge.

21
00:01:06,485 --> 00:01:09,977
And could you get rid of this traffic pattern
while you're in the area?

22
00:01:10,055 --> 00:01:11,613
I think we could do that.

23
00:01:11,690 --> 00:01:14,853
Vein stripping is normally considered
a same-day procedure...

24
00:01:14,927 --> 00:01:18,021
but in conjunction
with your tankles...ankles...

25
00:01:18,097 --> 00:01:20,361
your recovery might be
slightly lengthened.

26
00:01:20,432 --> 00:01:22,195
That would be fine.

27
00:01:23,736 --> 00:01:25,203
Excuse me...

28
00:01:25,604 --> 00:01:28,266
but there is a woman camped out
who refuses to leave...

29
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:32,709
untiI she gets to talk to that
"arrogant, oversexed, antichrist."

30
00:01:37,349 --> 00:01:40,182
Ms. Caine, would you excuse me
for a moment?

31
00:01:46,625 --> 00:01:49,958
You've been in therapy
for over 10 years, Ms. Caine?

32
00:01:50,596 --> 00:01:55,192
It's been tremendously helpful
in dealing with a variety of identity issues.

33
00:01:56,035 --> 00:01:57,127
Really?

34
00:01:57,202 --> 00:01:59,193
I couldn't exist without therapy.

35
00:01:59,271 --> 00:02:02,331
Life is too stressfuI to go it alone,
you know?

36
00:02:08,914 --> 00:02:10,381
Hey, asshole.

37
00:02:14,119 --> 00:02:16,053
Would you mind
sitting over here, sweetheart?

38
00:02:16,121 --> 00:02:18,954
I don't want to have to
bomb my Jacobson chair for crabs.

39
00:02:19,024 --> 00:02:20,218
Good one.

40
00:02:21,093 --> 00:02:22,651
I've been expecting you.

41
00:02:22,728 --> 00:02:23,888
Really?

42
00:02:23,962 --> 00:02:26,123
You're here to tell me
you're pressing charges...

43
00:02:26,198 --> 00:02:29,167
for that little rough-up
in the parking garage a few weeks ago.

44
00:02:29,234 --> 00:02:31,429
I've been waiting
for this moment to arrive.

45
00:02:31,503 --> 00:02:33,596
You're far too vindictive to drop that ball.

46
00:02:33,672 --> 00:02:35,572
So I got the tape.

47
00:02:37,142 --> 00:02:39,372
That's intriguing. What tape?

48
00:02:39,445 --> 00:02:41,538
The parking garage surveillance tape.

49
00:02:41,613 --> 00:02:44,707
Our brawI was caught on two cameras.

50
00:02:44,783 --> 00:02:46,751
Both of which show you
as the provocateur.

51
00:02:46,819 --> 00:02:47,979
You pushed and you pushed...

52
00:02:48,053 --> 00:02:51,352
and I finally pushed back
out of self-defense.

53
00:02:54,727 --> 00:02:56,558
You don't have a case.

54
00:02:56,628 --> 00:03:01,031
lf I wanted to press charges, Christian,
it would be for attempted murder.

55
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:05,594
But lucky for you, myself and our baby
survived your push to the pavement.

56
00:03:07,106 --> 00:03:09,006
That's right, asshole.

57
00:03:09,775 --> 00:03:11,242
I'm pregnant.

58
00:03:13,645 --> 00:03:16,239
First time at the plate,
and I get credited with the RBl?

59
00:03:16,315 --> 00:03:18,510
-You're the only batter.
-I was wearing a rubber.

60
00:03:18,584 --> 00:03:22,543
Well, slugger, either it broke,
or I'm carrying the next Savior.

61
00:03:24,089 --> 00:03:25,647
So you're here to propose?

62
00:03:25,724 --> 00:03:29,490
Just because I'm carrying Satan's baby
doesn't mean I need to marry the father.

63
00:03:29,561 --> 00:03:31,085
I'm not here for a ring.

64
00:03:31,163 --> 00:03:35,065
I'm here to tell you
that you need to pay for what you've done.

65
00:03:35,868 --> 00:03:37,267
I'm paying.

66
00:03:38,504 --> 00:03:40,199
I don't owe you anything.

67
00:03:40,272 --> 00:03:43,173
You are a cold-blooded predator, Christian.

68
00:03:43,609 --> 00:03:47,204
I was eight months celibate.
You seduced me and you threw me away.

69
00:03:47,279 --> 00:03:49,611
Well, surprise. I am not disposable!

70
00:03:49,681 --> 00:03:53,014
There is a price to pay for what you did,
and you're gonna pay it.

71
00:03:53,085 --> 00:03:55,383
I've already had two abortions.

72
00:03:55,788 --> 00:04:00,054
The last one went badly,
and I didn't think that I could conceive.

73
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:03,355
Maybe this is my last chance.

74
00:04:05,898 --> 00:04:08,366
Maybe I'm meant to have this baby.

75
00:04:14,706 --> 00:04:15,900
Christ!

76
00:04:17,009 --> 00:04:18,806
I can't do it alone.

77
00:04:19,311 --> 00:04:21,871
lf I'm gonna have this child,
I'm gonna need your help.

78
00:04:21,947 --> 00:04:23,744
I'm gonna need your support...

79
00:04:23,916 --> 00:04:27,010
and you're gonna have to be
actively involved in its upbringing.

80
00:04:27,085 --> 00:04:29,952
Otherwise, I'm gonna have to get rid of it.

81
00:04:32,024 --> 00:04:34,424
I've never had to deaI with this.

82
00:04:35,661 --> 00:04:37,652
I've always made a point
of being so careful.

83
00:04:37,729 --> 00:04:40,289
I understand. It's a very difficuIt decision.

84
00:04:40,365 --> 00:04:43,357
Either you want your kid
to join the brotherhood of man...

85
00:04:43,435 --> 00:04:46,632
or you want it
to be a part of stem cell research.

86
00:04:50,876 --> 00:04:52,400
Take your time.

87
00:04:52,678 --> 00:04:56,114
We've got one week to decide
if you're ready for parentaI responsibility.

88
00:04:56,181 --> 00:04:59,412
-Why did you wait so long?
-Because I just figured it out!

89
00:04:59,485 --> 00:05:02,079
Because of my bulimia,
I have a sporadic menstruaI cycle.

90
00:05:02,154 --> 00:05:06,591
I'm also frequently nauseous,
and I spend a great deaI of time in denial.

91
00:05:07,993 --> 00:05:09,756
One week, Christian.

92
00:05:11,897 --> 00:05:14,229
You still got my number, right?

93
00:06:10,522 --> 00:06:13,616
To be most effective, condoms
should be used with a spermicide.

94
00:06:13,692 --> 00:06:16,559
Sean, I may not be much
with a mentoplasty...

95
00:06:16,628 --> 00:06:20,064
but I assure you, I'm a goddamn expert
about putting a rubber on my dick.

96
00:06:20,132 --> 00:06:24,034
Used correctly, the typicaI failure rate
of latex condoms is about 3°%.

97
00:06:24,102 --> 00:06:27,094
When used incorrectly,
the failure rate rises to 12°%.

98
00:06:27,172 --> 00:06:29,436
-Read the box.
-You stop to read the box?

99
00:06:29,508 --> 00:06:31,840
No wonder Julia's still pissed.

100
00:06:33,679 --> 00:06:35,010
I'm sorry.

101
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:37,211
That was out of line.

102
00:06:39,084 --> 00:06:41,678
Cut me some slack here. I'm pregnant.

103
00:06:48,694 --> 00:06:50,992
You really miss her, don't you?

104
00:06:51,463 --> 00:06:52,623
Megan.

105
00:06:54,166 --> 00:06:57,932
I can't even grieve in private,
because Julia knows who I'm grieving for.

106
00:06:58,003 --> 00:07:00,528
I have to go into the bathroom to....

107
00:07:00,839 --> 00:07:03,501
You should have seen me
at Annie's party this weekend.

108
00:07:03,575 --> 00:07:06,567
I scared the kids.
They had never seen a clown so sad.

109
00:07:06,645 --> 00:07:09,842
One of them came up to me
and offered me a cookie.

110
00:07:24,129 --> 00:07:26,597
-You threw Annie a birthday party?
-It was small.

111
00:07:26,665 --> 00:07:29,793
We didn't think an 8-year-old's birthday
would mean so much to you.

112
00:07:29,868 --> 00:07:32,769
She's not an 8-year-old,
she's my goddaughter.

113
00:07:37,743 --> 00:07:39,574
Julia asked me not to tell you.

114
00:07:39,645 --> 00:07:42,944
She didn't want you there.
I don't know why. Do you?

115
00:07:44,583 --> 00:07:47,313
All right, sailors. Tankles away.

116
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:49,914
Hit it.

117
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,483
Present for the birthday girl.

118
00:08:56,555 --> 00:08:58,580
I hope you kept the receipt.

119
00:08:58,657 --> 00:09:01,421
It only shits in the cage,
which you take out once a week.

120
00:09:01,493 --> 00:09:03,461
And if it gets too much...

121
00:09:03,528 --> 00:09:07,624
you don't have to flush.
You just bake at 300, and serve over rice.

122
00:09:15,407 --> 00:09:17,967
Hey, there's my birthday girl.

123
00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:19,338
What do you think?

124
00:09:19,411 --> 00:09:22,175
Are you ready
for a little more responsibility?

125
00:09:24,783 --> 00:09:27,980
He knows me.
He keeps pecking at my finger.

126
00:09:28,353 --> 00:09:31,220
Thank you so much, Uncle Christian.

127
00:09:33,325 --> 00:09:34,622
Pleasure.

128
00:09:34,693 --> 00:09:37,685
I'm sorry you had to work
and miss my party.

129
00:09:37,829 --> 00:09:39,057
Me, too.

130
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:43,627
So what's his name?

131
00:09:46,338 --> 00:09:48,067
I know. Pecker.

132
00:09:49,174 --> 00:09:50,266
Pecker.

133
00:09:53,912 --> 00:09:58,474
Honey, why don't you go to your room
and introduce Pecker to Frisky?

134
00:09:59,684 --> 00:10:00,708
Okay.

135
00:10:08,794 --> 00:10:13,060
So, just out of curiosity,
was it an emergency I was busy with...

136
00:10:13,131 --> 00:10:15,292
or just your average breast job?

137
00:10:16,268 --> 00:10:18,634
I need a little distance, Christian.

138
00:10:18,703 --> 00:10:21,900
Look, I know how hard
this thing with Sean has been...

139
00:10:21,973 --> 00:10:24,407
-but that's no reason--
-How long have you known...

140
00:10:24,476 --> 00:10:26,273
about him and Megan?

141
00:10:28,013 --> 00:10:30,675
Look, I couldn't betray my best friend.

142
00:10:31,082 --> 00:10:33,846
You've betrayed him with me,
haven't you?

143
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:38,448
It wasn't my place
to tell you about his affair.

144
00:10:40,926 --> 00:10:42,951
Don't cut me out, Julia, please.

145
00:10:43,028 --> 00:10:47,021
It's just not working anymore, Christian:
you being in our lives.

146
00:10:47,465 --> 00:10:48,989
I can't handle it.

147
00:10:49,067 --> 00:10:51,535
Because you're afraid you'll cheat?

148
00:10:51,603 --> 00:10:54,094
lf you're afraid I'll cross that line again,
I won't.

149
00:10:54,172 --> 00:10:58,131
Believe me, I care more about this family
than whatever is between us.

150
00:11:04,049 --> 00:11:07,075
Maybe if you didn't have us
to fall back on...

151
00:11:07,352 --> 00:11:10,549
you'd finally go out
and get a family of your own.

152
00:11:30,141 --> 00:11:32,507
It's me. Cara Fitzgerald.

153
00:11:37,749 --> 00:11:39,478
You look wonderful.

154
00:11:40,886 --> 00:11:42,751
Thanks for your prayers.

155
00:11:42,821 --> 00:11:45,688
Mom told me
you were at the hospitaI a lot.

156
00:11:47,459 --> 00:11:50,257
I just wanted to make sure you were okay.

157
00:11:50,462 --> 00:11:53,295
And that you're part of the prayer group?

158
00:11:53,999 --> 00:11:57,662
Don't be offended that I didn't remember.
My short-term memory's a mess.

159
00:11:57,736 --> 00:12:00,364
I don't even know who my friends are.

160
00:12:01,907 --> 00:12:03,204
Who does?

161
00:12:05,844 --> 00:12:08,938
There's a prayer meeting
after schooI next week.

162
00:12:09,147 --> 00:12:11,047
You'll be there, right?

163
00:12:28,833 --> 00:12:30,801
-Good night.
-Good night.

164
00:12:51,456 --> 00:12:54,357
Do you want
to stay in this marriage, Julia?

165
00:12:56,661 --> 00:12:58,128
I don't know.

166
00:12:58,997 --> 00:13:01,022
What is it you don't know?

167
00:13:04,869 --> 00:13:07,337
lf I'm staying in it for the kids.

168
00:13:09,107 --> 00:13:11,541
lf I'm staying in it out of fear.

169
00:13:15,947 --> 00:13:18,575
You think you can ever love me again?

170
00:13:21,019 --> 00:13:22,509
I don't know.

171
00:13:25,824 --> 00:13:27,621
I don't even know...

172
00:13:28,193 --> 00:13:31,651
if I should feeI partly responsible
for what happened.

173
00:13:35,567 --> 00:13:39,025
Sometimes I think we got married
for the wrong reasons.

174
00:13:43,775 --> 00:13:46,175
You think
we'd have gotten married at all...

175
00:13:46,244 --> 00:13:48,508
if I hadn't been pregnant with Matt?

176
00:13:51,383 --> 00:13:52,873
I don't know.

177
00:14:12,103 --> 00:14:13,866
But I'm glad we did.

178
00:14:27,018 --> 00:14:28,485
Sean, I can't.

179
00:14:29,087 --> 00:14:30,213
Okay.

180
00:14:32,057 --> 00:14:34,082
No, it's just....

181
00:14:36,861 --> 00:14:38,852
I want you to get tested.

182
00:14:41,132 --> 00:14:43,623
She was in and out of the hospital.

183
00:14:43,701 --> 00:14:45,794
She had blood transfusions.

184
00:14:47,005 --> 00:14:49,200
You want me to take that risk?

185
00:14:50,742 --> 00:14:53,267
I'll go in for a complete physical.

186
00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:56,513
Maybe Schiff can see me tomorrow.

187
00:15:14,065 --> 00:15:15,430
Ms. Caine?

188
00:15:16,634 --> 00:15:18,397
How are you feeling?

189
00:15:19,437 --> 00:15:20,904
My legs hurt.

190
00:15:21,773 --> 00:15:24,901
That's to be expected,
but it all went very well.

191
00:15:24,976 --> 00:15:27,501
Nurse Linda's here with some water.

192
00:15:27,779 --> 00:15:30,748
-I want Juicy Juice.
-Water would be better.

193
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:32,578
I want Juicy Juice!

194
00:15:36,321 --> 00:15:40,121
Montana Caine's having
an adverse reaction to the anesthesia.

195
00:15:41,059 --> 00:15:42,890
No, they're too big!

196
00:15:42,961 --> 00:15:45,896
You were supposed
to make my boobies smaller.

197
00:15:46,131 --> 00:15:47,530
Ms. Caine.

198
00:15:47,765 --> 00:15:49,426
My name is Sassy.

199
00:15:50,268 --> 00:15:53,863
Sassy, do you know
who the president of the United States is?

200
00:15:54,038 --> 00:15:55,938
-AI Gore.
-She's fine.

201
00:15:56,007 --> 00:15:57,702
I want smaller boobies!

202
00:15:57,775 --> 00:16:01,108
You promised me smaller boobies!

203
00:16:01,179 --> 00:16:04,842
I told you we'd have to wait.
We can't do everything at once.

204
00:16:04,916 --> 00:16:06,884
Why are you always first?

205
00:16:06,951 --> 00:16:08,919
Because I'm the grownup.

206
00:16:09,287 --> 00:16:12,814
I don't want the boys
to grab them anymore.

207
00:16:13,691 --> 00:16:17,752
They'll make them smaller for you.
We just have to be patient.

208
00:16:18,796 --> 00:16:20,787
The doctor will help us.

209
00:16:29,474 --> 00:16:33,171
Before Montana was diagnosed
with multiple personality disorder...

210
00:16:33,244 --> 00:16:35,405
she was unable to hold down a job...

211
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:38,040
unable to sleep
for more than an hour at a time...

212
00:16:38,116 --> 00:16:40,346
and she tried to commit suicide twice.

213
00:16:40,418 --> 00:16:43,012
How many alter personalities
does she have?

214
00:16:43,087 --> 00:16:45,419
Now it's just she and Sassy.

215
00:16:45,490 --> 00:16:47,890
But 10 years ago,
when we first started treatment...

216
00:16:47,959 --> 00:16:50,587
there were anywhere between 20 and 25.

217
00:16:50,695 --> 00:16:52,686
l'd say we're doing quite well.

218
00:16:52,764 --> 00:16:55,927
And so you think that
performing a breast reduction surgery...

219
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,436
because one of the alters demands it,
is the key to greater integration?

220
00:16:59,504 --> 00:17:02,962
lntegration is not my goal, Dr. Santiago.

221
00:17:03,041 --> 00:17:04,906
lnternaI harmony is.

222
00:17:04,976 --> 00:17:07,240
What about SSRls and tricyclics?

223
00:17:07,312 --> 00:17:11,749
MPD patients seldom derive
more than limited relief...

224
00:17:11,816 --> 00:17:13,875
from psychopharmacotherapy.

225
00:17:13,952 --> 00:17:15,317
Then there are also...

226
00:17:15,386 --> 00:17:19,117
the different responses of the alters
to contend with as well.

227
00:17:19,190 --> 00:17:23,251
So Montana might require
one kind of antidepressant...

228
00:17:23,328 --> 00:17:25,319
while Sassy would need another?

229
00:17:25,396 --> 00:17:29,093
Exactly. It can get a bit confusing.

230
00:17:31,703 --> 00:17:34,672
So what would be the risk,
in your opinion...

231
00:17:34,739 --> 00:17:37,902
of choosing not to go ahead
with this additionaI procedure?

232
00:17:37,976 --> 00:17:42,675
Sassy is the gatekeeper
for all of the other personalities.

233
00:17:42,747 --> 00:17:47,275
And she's the only one besides Montana
who's asking for a physicaI change.

234
00:17:47,518 --> 00:17:51,545
lf she remains happy,
which she has for the last severaI years...

235
00:17:51,856 --> 00:17:54,450
the other personalities stay dormant.

236
00:17:54,993 --> 00:17:56,722
lf she's ignored...

237
00:17:57,128 --> 00:18:00,825
she may feeI the need of their support
in order to get our attention.

238
00:18:00,898 --> 00:18:04,857
-So all those other personalities--
-Could return. That's right.

239
00:18:05,136 --> 00:18:07,696
For how long, I can't say.

240
00:18:07,972 --> 00:18:11,169
But if you knew Montana 10 years ago...

241
00:18:11,242 --> 00:18:13,870
you wouldn't want to take that chance.

242
00:18:36,634 --> 00:18:37,828
Henry.

243
00:18:39,037 --> 00:18:40,527
What are you doing?

244
00:18:40,605 --> 00:18:42,402
He's praying with me.

245
00:18:43,474 --> 00:18:46,204
That's why we call this the Prayer Club.

246
00:18:46,577 --> 00:18:47,942
Remember, Matt?

247
00:19:00,358 --> 00:19:02,849
Do you think more people will come?

248
00:19:06,898 --> 00:19:09,025
Maybe we should just start.

249
00:19:20,411 --> 00:19:22,242
Before the accident...

250
00:19:22,313 --> 00:19:26,477
did I serve refreshments before
or after the reading of the minutes?

251
00:19:27,485 --> 00:19:28,713
Before.

252
00:19:37,462 --> 00:19:39,054
What the hell are you doing here?

253
00:19:39,130 --> 00:19:41,598
I wanted to make sure
she didn't recognize me.

254
00:19:41,666 --> 00:19:43,634
ls that the only reason?

255
00:19:45,236 --> 00:19:46,965
I'm looking for solace, Matt.

256
00:19:47,038 --> 00:19:49,802
My faith says we've got to pay
for what we did.

257
00:19:49,941 --> 00:19:52,705
But, my God, didn't we get away with it?

258
00:19:52,977 --> 00:19:55,411
Maybe I need a new faith, a new identity:

259
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:58,347
one that reflects the reaI world we live in.

260
00:19:58,416 --> 00:20:01,283
Where not everybody pays,
and where sometimes...

261
00:20:01,352 --> 00:20:04,913
you walk away,
and the bad thing turns into something....

262
00:20:06,657 --> 00:20:08,215
Something good.

263
00:20:19,203 --> 00:20:22,172
Today's prayer group thought
is the following:

264
00:20:23,074 --> 00:20:26,407
Grace shines on everyone,
no matter what.

265
00:20:27,111 --> 00:20:28,908
What about criminals?

266
00:20:29,614 --> 00:20:31,980
Does your God forgive criminals?

267
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:38,755
We're all sinners, saved through Christ.

268
00:20:39,957 --> 00:20:42,152
So I guess the answer's yes.

269
00:21:06,551 --> 00:21:08,542
Shouldn't you be drinking decaf?

270
00:21:12,223 --> 00:21:13,417
Phone out of order?

271
00:21:13,491 --> 00:21:17,928
I just thought I should be here
to catch you when you fainted from shock.

272
00:21:18,596 --> 00:21:20,587
I think we should have this baby.

273
00:21:20,665 --> 00:21:24,032
I mean, you should have it,
and I'll pay for it.

274
00:21:27,004 --> 00:21:28,631
Cue the violins.

275
00:21:30,174 --> 00:21:32,108
Why the change of heart?

276
00:21:32,176 --> 00:21:34,201
I've realized I want more.

277
00:21:35,279 --> 00:21:36,974
I wanna give more.

278
00:21:39,183 --> 00:21:41,151
How many days in a week?

279
00:21:41,219 --> 00:21:42,914
Okay, so I'm a day late.

280
00:21:42,987 --> 00:21:45,046
What a difference a day makes.

281
00:21:47,291 --> 00:21:49,259
I sat in that clinic...

282
00:21:49,327 --> 00:21:52,592
and I stared at myself
while waiting for your call.

283
00:21:53,831 --> 00:21:56,459
A last-minute pardon from the governor.

284
00:21:58,202 --> 00:21:59,328
Never came.

285
00:22:00,972 --> 00:22:05,170
Your deafening silence woke me up
to a cold, hard reality, Christian.

286
00:22:05,343 --> 00:22:08,403
You are an unreliable, uncaring person.

287
00:22:10,181 --> 00:22:13,275
You'd be an unreliable, uncaring father.

288
00:22:15,386 --> 00:22:16,648
That's not true.

289
00:22:16,721 --> 00:22:18,689
Why are you arguing with me?

290
00:22:21,459 --> 00:22:22,824
It's done.

291
00:22:30,902 --> 00:22:32,460
You smell good.

292
00:22:33,738 --> 00:22:36,468
You scared me. I didn't hear you come in.

293
00:22:47,118 --> 00:22:49,211
I got my test results back.

294
00:22:50,488 --> 00:22:52,251
Blood pressure could be better.

295
00:22:52,323 --> 00:22:55,622
He asked if I've been under
any undue stress of late.

296
00:22:56,627 --> 00:22:58,390
I told him, "A little."

297
00:23:00,998 --> 00:23:04,729
But in terms of any of the things
that you were, you know...

298
00:23:05,469 --> 00:23:08,802
concerned about, you don't have to be.

299
00:23:18,683 --> 00:23:20,674
No, I can't do it, Sean.

300
00:23:21,852 --> 00:23:23,376
Can't do what?

301
00:23:25,456 --> 00:23:27,981
I can't have sex with you right now.

302
00:23:28,192 --> 00:23:30,160
I'm sorry. I just can't.

303
00:23:35,566 --> 00:23:37,796
I never should have told you about Megan.

304
00:23:37,868 --> 00:23:41,827
I thought if I were just honest,
somehow things would be better.

305
00:23:41,906 --> 00:23:44,431
At least we could be reaI with each other
for a change.

306
00:23:44,508 --> 00:23:46,032
We are being real, Sean.

307
00:23:46,110 --> 00:23:48,510
You're just not liking
the results you're getting.

308
00:23:48,579 --> 00:23:51,548
Bullshit! You're not forgiving me,
because you can't, Julia.

309
00:23:51,616 --> 00:23:53,243
You don't want to.

310
00:23:53,317 --> 00:23:55,877
At least be honest about it.
Then we could go from there.

311
00:23:55,953 --> 00:23:57,716
You're right. I don't want to.

312
00:23:57,788 --> 00:24:00,586
It's just too easy for you to waltz in here...

313
00:24:00,658 --> 00:24:02,558
and tell me you've done the dishes...

314
00:24:02,627 --> 00:24:05,721
you've taken the test, you've had an affair.

315
00:24:07,732 --> 00:24:09,222
You're right.

316
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:11,527
I don't want to forgive you.

317
00:24:11,702 --> 00:24:14,899
Did you even need me to get tested?
Was that just a lie...

318
00:24:14,972 --> 00:24:17,372
so you wouldn't have
to get near me for a few days...

319
00:24:17,441 --> 00:24:21,070
and then you think up some other way
to avoid touching me.

320
00:24:22,546 --> 00:24:25,743
Look, you need time to forgive me,
take your time.

321
00:24:26,984 --> 00:24:29,282
But let's not lie to each other anymore.

322
00:24:29,353 --> 00:24:33,483
lf we're gonna start over,
we've got to start by telling the truth.

323
00:24:33,858 --> 00:24:38,124
I don't want to have a relationship
that's buiIt on lies. Not anymore.

324
00:24:43,334 --> 00:24:45,063
You're right, Sean.

325
00:24:47,138 --> 00:24:48,730
No more lies.

326
00:25:07,224 --> 00:25:09,886
Look, I'm going along
with your decision, Dr. Santiago.

327
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:11,518
What are you so angry about?

328
00:25:11,595 --> 00:25:14,462
Why wasn't I present
at the patient's initiaI consultation?

329
00:25:14,532 --> 00:25:17,763
The woman had been in therapy
for 10 years. It seemed to be working.

330
00:25:17,835 --> 00:25:21,032
-There was no red flag. Christian and l--
-Right. Christian and you.

331
00:25:21,105 --> 00:25:23,972
I keep forgetting about the hierarchy
here at McNamara / Troy.

332
00:25:24,041 --> 00:25:25,668
I keep imagining I'm a part of it.

333
00:25:25,743 --> 00:25:28,974
You weren't brought aboard
with the promise of parity.

334
00:25:29,046 --> 00:25:32,777
What about respect?
It's because I slept with Christian, isn't it?

335
00:25:32,850 --> 00:25:35,512
Suddenly, I'm no longer
a professionaI with credentials.

336
00:25:35,586 --> 00:25:37,520
I'm just his latest conquest.

337
00:25:37,722 --> 00:25:40,282
I'm not here to pass judgment
on your promiscuity.

338
00:25:40,357 --> 00:25:43,451
Why don't you admit it?
You're operating out of repressed rage...

339
00:25:43,527 --> 00:25:45,893
because I rejected you
and slept with your partner.

340
00:25:45,963 --> 00:25:47,658
Dr. Santiago, as a professional...

341
00:25:47,732 --> 00:25:49,962
it should've been obvious
when I came on to you...

342
00:25:50,034 --> 00:25:52,468
I was acting out
because of trouble in my marriage.

343
00:25:52,536 --> 00:25:54,265
It wasn't personal.

344
00:25:54,538 --> 00:25:56,631
You could have been anyone.

345
00:25:57,708 --> 00:25:59,039
After you.

346
00:26:05,716 --> 00:26:07,684
Good morning, Ms. Caine.

347
00:26:08,786 --> 00:26:12,381
We wanted to talk to you
about your request for a breast reduction.

348
00:26:12,456 --> 00:26:16,324
-You mean Sassy's request.
-That's right. Sassy's request.

349
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:19,987
Unfortunately, we've decided
not to go ahead with the procedure.

350
00:26:21,799 --> 00:26:24,768
I don't understand.
I thought Dr. Reed was in favor of it.

351
00:26:24,835 --> 00:26:27,269
She is, and I can assure you...

352
00:26:27,338 --> 00:26:29,738
we gave her opinion serious consideration.

353
00:26:29,807 --> 00:26:32,867
But in the end,
we had to abide by our own decision.

354
00:26:32,943 --> 00:26:36,310
But Sassy really wants it,
and if Dr. Reed thinks we should do it--

355
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:38,871
Dr. Reed is extremely capable...

356
00:26:39,016 --> 00:26:41,484
and I know you've made
tremendous strides with her.

357
00:26:41,552 --> 00:26:45,249
I would like to feeI more certain
that we've exhausted every alternative...

358
00:26:45,322 --> 00:26:48,052
before resorting to an invasive surgery.

359
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:51,726
And you feeI the same way,
Dr. McNamara?

360
00:26:54,231 --> 00:26:57,257
I think what Dr. Santiago says
makes sense.

361
00:26:59,069 --> 00:27:00,161
Okay.

362
00:27:01,839 --> 00:27:04,069
I just hope Sassy understands.

363
00:27:04,275 --> 00:27:05,936
I'm sure she will.

364
00:27:06,210 --> 00:27:08,906
She might even feeI relieved, ultimately.

365
00:27:14,718 --> 00:27:15,878
Bitch.

366
00:27:17,087 --> 00:27:20,386
-Excuse me?
-I said, "Bitch."

367
00:27:22,059 --> 00:27:24,357
You gonna make that child wait a year?

368
00:27:24,962 --> 00:27:27,453
You know her suffering.
You don't do shit about it.

369
00:27:27,531 --> 00:27:30,261
-Ms. Caine....
-Do I look like a Ms. Caine to you?

370
00:27:36,841 --> 00:27:40,277
I'm Dr. McNamara. And you are?

371
00:27:41,011 --> 00:27:42,239
Justice.

372
00:27:43,414 --> 00:27:45,746
And that is what I seek:

373
00:27:45,816 --> 00:27:49,650
Justice for the unheard and the unseen.

374
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:51,813
For the oppressed and the repressed.

375
00:27:51,889 --> 00:27:54,119
For those who have been
forced into the shadows...

376
00:27:54,191 --> 00:27:56,455
and who will remain there no longer.

377
00:27:56,527 --> 00:27:58,427
Justice, please don't do this.

378
00:27:58,495 --> 00:28:00,963
Do not "Please, Justice" me.

379
00:28:01,031 --> 00:28:04,660
We must rise up
and defend the rights of that little girl.

380
00:28:06,937 --> 00:28:09,997
And our numbers will be so great...

381
00:28:11,141 --> 00:28:15,373
that we're gonna make that
Million Man March look like a block party.

382
00:28:18,415 --> 00:28:20,815
I'm scheduling Sassy for surgery.

383
00:28:37,735 --> 00:28:39,259
Ham and cheese.

384
00:28:42,139 --> 00:28:45,506
Gee, if only l'd saved my foreskin,
I could have given it to you.

385
00:28:45,576 --> 00:28:48,443
Stop sitting shiva already.
You're not even Jewish.

386
00:28:51,949 --> 00:28:53,712
I think you're going to extremes.

387
00:28:53,784 --> 00:28:56,048
This may just be a way
of dealing with your guilt.

388
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:59,385
DeaI with your own guilt.
As far as I'm concerned...

389
00:28:59,523 --> 00:29:03,254
everything happened so that
I could discover the kingdom of heaven...

390
00:29:03,327 --> 00:29:06,353
and live happily ever after...

391
00:29:08,565 --> 00:29:09,896
with Cara.

392
00:29:12,136 --> 00:29:15,572
Are you saying
you have feelings for this girl?

393
00:29:16,173 --> 00:29:18,767
-What if I do?
-Well, it's a bad idea, Henry.

394
00:29:20,210 --> 00:29:22,235
Start getting physical,
next thing you know...

395
00:29:22,313 --> 00:29:24,508
you'll want to be honest,
tell her everything.

396
00:29:24,581 --> 00:29:27,414
I'm not gonna say anything.
It would just cause her more pain.

397
00:29:27,484 --> 00:29:29,349
What's happening to you, man?

398
00:29:30,287 --> 00:29:32,050
I found the truth...

399
00:29:33,724 --> 00:29:35,624
and it has set me free.

400
00:29:41,165 --> 00:29:43,463
I'm gonna ask Cara to the prom.

401
00:29:44,168 --> 00:29:48,195
-Hey, guys. ls this seat taken?
-ls now.

402
00:29:53,744 --> 00:29:56,008
I'll be right back. I forgot my orange juice.

403
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:58,207
Don't move. I'll get it.

404
00:30:02,353 --> 00:30:05,151
He's becoming more Christlike every day.

405
00:30:05,489 --> 00:30:07,218
He's changing all right.

406
00:30:07,391 --> 00:30:11,191
When someone goes through change,
they need people they can depend on.

407
00:30:14,898 --> 00:30:18,766
-Matt, can I ask you a favor?
-Sure. Anything.

408
00:30:22,806 --> 00:30:26,242
-Forget it. It's too embarrassing.
-No, Cara. Come on.

409
00:30:29,346 --> 00:30:31,541
Will you take me to the prom?

410
00:30:32,549 --> 00:30:33,573
What?

411
00:30:33,650 --> 00:30:35,811
I've never been to a dance before...

412
00:30:35,886 --> 00:30:38,650
and I thought if I went with somebody
who really knew me....

413
00:30:38,722 --> 00:30:41,088
I mean, you've already seen me
at my worst, so--

414
00:30:41,158 --> 00:30:44,252
Cara, look, l'd like to, but--

415
00:30:44,328 --> 00:30:46,057
-You've asked someone else?
-No.

416
00:30:46,130 --> 00:30:48,121
One OJ on me.

417
00:30:49,833 --> 00:30:52,427
I'm so sorry. I thought....

418
00:30:53,470 --> 00:30:55,700
God, I'm such a sociaI retard.

419
00:30:57,341 --> 00:30:59,639
Schmuck! What did you say to her?

420
00:31:00,844 --> 00:31:02,106
Nothing.

421
00:31:02,279 --> 00:31:04,338
Never mind. I'll find out myself.

422
00:31:04,415 --> 00:31:06,007
Hey, Henry.

423
00:31:13,590 --> 00:31:16,889
She asked me to the prom.

424
00:31:20,597 --> 00:31:21,962
<i>How's that?</i>

425
00:31:38,015 --> 00:31:39,004
Hi.

426
00:31:40,484 --> 00:31:41,815
I just....

427
00:31:43,854 --> 00:31:46,550
Before Annie gets too attached to it.
That's all.

428
00:31:46,924 --> 00:31:49,119
I can return it. Don't worry.

429
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:51,551
Was he too messy?

430
00:31:52,629 --> 00:31:55,757
Pecker and Frisky
didn't exactly see eye to eye.

431
00:31:56,033 --> 00:31:57,193
Sorry.

432
00:31:58,235 --> 00:31:59,896
You wanna come in?

433
00:32:00,871 --> 00:32:04,705
-I can't stay.
-Good. I'm not prepared for company.

434
00:32:13,750 --> 00:32:14,978
Four stars?

435
00:32:17,254 --> 00:32:18,744
Two thumbs up.

436
00:32:19,289 --> 00:32:23,555
Memorable performances in a sensitive
story about two female contortionists.

437
00:32:23,627 --> 00:32:26,027
I laughed. I cried. I came.

438
00:32:28,499 --> 00:32:31,491
So how are you guys doing?

439
00:32:32,669 --> 00:32:35,160
The family I've been excluded from,
I mean.

440
00:32:46,783 --> 00:32:48,444
What was she like?

441
00:32:49,686 --> 00:32:52,849
You don't need to do this.
It had nothing to do with you.

442
00:32:54,691 --> 00:32:56,352
What was she like?

443
00:32:58,195 --> 00:33:02,564
She was dying and she needed him,
and he feIt essential.

444
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:04,925
Just chalk it up to his midlife crisis.

445
00:33:05,002 --> 00:33:08,631
Let it go, right? Forgive and forget.

446
00:33:10,207 --> 00:33:13,699
I can't. lsn't that awful?

447
00:33:15,212 --> 00:33:17,680
For a while, I even feIt badly for him:

448
00:33:17,781 --> 00:33:21,478
that he lost this incredibly brave
and courageous woman.

449
00:33:22,719 --> 00:33:24,277
lsn't that pathetic?

450
00:33:24,354 --> 00:33:27,619
I'm the one he screwed,
and I feIt badly for him.

451
00:33:29,326 --> 00:33:31,055
Give yourself time.

452
00:33:32,362 --> 00:33:34,922
At least you're being honest
with each other.

453
00:33:36,867 --> 00:33:39,427
You're one step ahead of the rest of us.

454
00:33:46,210 --> 00:33:48,178
Can I use your bathroom?

455
00:34:33,757 --> 00:34:35,987
-Can I help you?
-Yes.

456
00:34:37,961 --> 00:34:40,759
l'd like to test the paternity of my son.

457
00:34:46,103 --> 00:34:48,264
I brought his razor.

458
00:34:49,106 --> 00:34:51,700
The person I spoke with
said that'd be okay...

459
00:34:51,775 --> 00:34:53,902
as long as he was the only one using it.

460
00:34:53,977 --> 00:34:55,740
We usually prefer a cheek swab...

461
00:34:55,812 --> 00:34:58,906
but in cases where confidentiality
is an issue....

462
00:34:58,982 --> 00:35:01,951
Yes. It is. It's very much an issue.

463
00:35:02,319 --> 00:35:03,809
This should be fine.

464
00:35:04,288 --> 00:35:07,553
Did you bring a sample
from the father in question?

465
00:35:09,359 --> 00:35:10,690
Thank you.

466
00:35:16,366 --> 00:35:18,493
-Great hair.
-Excuse me?

467
00:35:18,568 --> 00:35:20,058
Lots of roots.

468
00:35:23,006 --> 00:35:25,406
How conclusive are these tests, exactly?

469
00:35:25,475 --> 00:35:28,137
Our margin of error is less than 1°%.

470
00:35:28,211 --> 00:35:31,112
That's as close to the truth
as you're going to get.

471
00:35:53,704 --> 00:35:55,365
Look, just say it, okay?

472
00:35:55,439 --> 00:35:57,407
I'm operating on a psychotic woman...

473
00:35:57,474 --> 00:35:59,942
in order to appease
her 8-year-old fantasy self...

474
00:36:00,010 --> 00:36:02,979
-and you find it morally reprehensible.
-No, I don't.

475
00:36:04,081 --> 00:36:06,311
We reshape hundreds of bodies
every year...

476
00:36:06,383 --> 00:36:08,749
in order to gratify all sorts of fantasies.

477
00:36:08,819 --> 00:36:13,347
lf you ask me, Ms. Montana Caine
seems a lot less delusionaI than most.

478
00:36:13,423 --> 00:36:16,915
-She's a multiple personality.
-Oh, please. Who isn't?

479
00:36:17,494 --> 00:36:20,952
To my mother, I'm a child.
To Jan, I'm a heartless, rejecting bitch...

480
00:36:21,031 --> 00:36:22,931
and to my dog, I'm God.

481
00:36:25,202 --> 00:36:27,193
Maybe I should get a dog.

482
00:36:28,105 --> 00:36:31,563
You have a point.
Father, surgeon, husband.

483
00:36:32,843 --> 00:36:35,744
The only difference is,
all of mine are named Sean...

484
00:36:36,580 --> 00:36:39,048
and no operation can help them get along.

485
00:36:46,523 --> 00:36:48,252
How are her vitals?

486
00:36:51,895 --> 00:36:53,226
Excellent.

487
00:36:54,030 --> 00:36:56,931
May I see her chart
from the last procedure, please?

488
00:36:57,100 --> 00:36:58,294
Something wrong?

489
00:36:58,368 --> 00:37:01,064
BP is 105/65.

490
00:37:01,138 --> 00:37:02,969
Her heart rate is 75.

491
00:37:03,273 --> 00:37:05,400
Respiration is 12 to 14.

492
00:37:06,109 --> 00:37:09,272
Ms. Caine is suddenly in incredible shape.

493
00:37:11,982 --> 00:37:15,145
It's like she changed
from a middle-aged woman...

494
00:37:15,819 --> 00:37:17,081
to a kid.

495
00:37:42,879 --> 00:37:44,813
No one's in right now.
Can I take a message?

496
00:37:44,881 --> 00:37:48,715
I left three messages at your office.
Your receptionist, by the way, is a bitch.

497
00:37:48,785 --> 00:37:51,583
FaithfuI as a bulldog.
Didn't let you get through once.

498
00:37:51,655 --> 00:37:53,520
Can I get through now?

499
00:38:07,471 --> 00:38:09,564
How much was the procedure?

500
00:38:11,675 --> 00:38:13,302
I didn't have it.

501
00:38:19,950 --> 00:38:22,077
-No kidding?
-I can prove it.

502
00:38:22,285 --> 00:38:26,016
I can come over tomorrow morning
and throw up on your floor.

503
00:38:38,201 --> 00:38:39,463
Why'd you lie to me?

504
00:38:39,536 --> 00:38:42,505
I thought maybe if you felt
some of my hurt and disappointment--

505
00:38:42,572 --> 00:38:44,233
Then we'd be even?

506
00:38:45,275 --> 00:38:47,903
I wasn't even sure I wanted this baby.

507
00:38:52,516 --> 00:38:55,815
You keep trying to fill up this void
with sex, but it never works.

508
00:38:55,886 --> 00:38:59,185
You still don't feeI whole.
So then you pray to a higher power...

509
00:38:59,256 --> 00:39:02,487
because you can't face the harsh reality
that you're alone.

510
00:39:04,594 --> 00:39:08,189
Then after one night of meaningless sex
with a complete bastard...

511
00:39:08,798 --> 00:39:11,995
you suddenly have a miracle
growing inside of you.

512
00:39:12,102 --> 00:39:13,865
Then all you know...

513
00:39:15,005 --> 00:39:16,734
is that you love...

514
00:39:18,341 --> 00:39:20,104
this person-to-be...

515
00:39:21,711 --> 00:39:23,303
unconditionally.

516
00:39:29,486 --> 00:39:31,010
So you think...

517
00:39:34,257 --> 00:39:36,487
maybe there is a higher power.

518
00:39:42,198 --> 00:39:43,825
Maybe this is it.

519
00:39:49,539 --> 00:39:52,736
So what kind of arrangement
are we talking about?

520
00:39:57,647 --> 00:39:59,239
A realistic one.

521
00:40:02,786 --> 00:40:07,485
FinanciaI support, visiting rights,
childproofing your apartment.

522
00:40:10,694 --> 00:40:12,992
Nothing you can't handle, asshole.

523
00:40:13,096 --> 00:40:15,929
Hey, watch your mouth in front of the kid.

524
00:40:34,117 --> 00:40:37,644
What's with the hat? You reconverting?

525
00:40:41,524 --> 00:40:44,516
ls this about prom,
because I'm not taking Cara, man.

526
00:40:44,594 --> 00:40:45,720
You're free to ask her.

527
00:40:45,795 --> 00:40:47,422
She's not Jewish.

528
00:40:48,031 --> 00:40:51,489
-Make up your mind, Henry.
-What mind? Whose mind?

529
00:40:51,568 --> 00:40:53,900
I have no idea who I am anymore.

530
00:40:54,537 --> 00:40:58,906
I tried to find a new identity, a new God,
a new set of beliefs, a new girlfriend.

531
00:40:58,975 --> 00:41:01,944
Nothing is making me feeI any better.

532
00:41:03,113 --> 00:41:05,138
You're still the same guy.

533
00:41:06,650 --> 00:41:08,049
No, I'm not.

534
00:41:12,222 --> 00:41:16,556
-Hey, don't do anything stupid.
-It's a little late for that.

535
00:41:18,695 --> 00:41:23,325
Henry, look, we're friends, okay?
My ass is on the line, too.

536
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:25,391
Then you better cover it.

537
00:41:25,935 --> 00:41:27,800
I just want to look in the mirror...

538
00:41:27,871 --> 00:41:30,362
and see an honest man
looking back at me...

539
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:33,700
and the only way to do that
is to act like one.

540
00:41:36,212 --> 00:41:39,875
So what's that supposed to mean?
You're gonna tell her what we did?

541
00:41:41,184 --> 00:41:43,482
That's exactly what that means.

542
00:41:54,864 --> 00:41:56,957
-She up yet?
-Any minute now.

543
00:41:57,033 --> 00:41:59,558
Would you make sure
we're set to move her to aftercare?

544
00:41:59,636 --> 00:42:01,160
I'll stay here.

545
00:42:02,972 --> 00:42:05,532
She sort of looks like a child, doesn't she?

546
00:42:06,743 --> 00:42:09,177
I wonder which one of them
gets to dream.

547
00:42:14,384 --> 00:42:15,544
Mommy.

548
00:42:20,290 --> 00:42:22,281
It's Dr. McNamara, Sassy.

549
00:42:24,094 --> 00:42:26,654
I just wanted to tell you
everything went fine.

550
00:42:26,730 --> 00:42:29,221
I'm the same as all the other kids?

551
00:42:30,567 --> 00:42:33,161
Your breasts will be less noticeable.

552
00:42:34,003 --> 00:42:35,334
Thank you.

553
00:42:39,275 --> 00:42:40,799
You're welcome.

554
00:42:45,148 --> 00:42:48,914
I got you apple, grape, and berry.

555
00:42:49,719 --> 00:42:51,243
You remembered.

556
00:43:06,603 --> 00:43:08,366
Are you leaving now?

557
00:43:09,706 --> 00:43:13,472
Yes...when Montana wakes up.

558
00:43:14,811 --> 00:43:17,837
Where do you go when Montana's here?

559
00:43:20,350 --> 00:43:21,817
Underneath...

560
00:43:22,886 --> 00:43:25,184
where nobody can hurt me.

561
00:43:29,793 --> 00:43:32,193
Can you tell me how to get there?

562
00:43:45,008 --> 00:43:47,636
Julia, are you all right? You look....

563
00:43:48,645 --> 00:43:50,135
I need to talk to you...

564
00:43:50,213 --> 00:43:54,081
and I didn't want to do it at home
or on the phone...

565
00:43:54,150 --> 00:43:56,345
in front of Sean or anything.

566
00:43:57,020 --> 00:43:58,248
Come in.

567
00:44:06,362 --> 00:44:08,990
-Look, I just need to be honest with you.
-About what?

568
00:44:09,065 --> 00:44:10,692
Don't you have any more toilet paper?

569
00:44:10,767 --> 00:44:14,294
I'm as bloated as a whale,
and there is no toilet paper.

570
00:44:14,537 --> 00:44:18,337
-I didn't know you had company.
-She's on her way out.

571
00:44:18,408 --> 00:44:21,502
Really, Christian,
we don't all pee standing up.

572
00:44:27,183 --> 00:44:31,017
Gina, Julia. Julia's my partner's wife...

573
00:44:31,588 --> 00:44:33,078
and Gina's....

574
00:44:34,057 --> 00:44:36,025
The mother of his child.

575
00:44:39,829 --> 00:44:41,626
You're having a baby?

576
00:44:43,366 --> 00:44:45,800
No, I'm having it. He's paying for it.

577
00:44:48,571 --> 00:44:50,198
-l'm...shocked.
-Yeah, I know.

578
00:44:50,273 --> 00:44:51,865
Can you see him as a father?

579
00:44:51,941 --> 00:44:55,104
I gotta go. Doctor's appointment at 10:00.

580
00:44:58,615 --> 00:45:00,583
It was nice meeting you.

581
00:45:07,891 --> 00:45:09,791
It's because of you, you know...

582
00:45:09,859 --> 00:45:12,953
what you said about
getting my own family, not using yours.

583
00:45:13,029 --> 00:45:15,190
It hurt like hell, but...

584
00:45:16,466 --> 00:45:17,831
made sense.

585
00:45:21,170 --> 00:45:23,730
Good. I'm glad.

586
00:45:26,509 --> 00:45:28,841
So what did you want to tell me?

587
00:45:31,781 --> 00:45:34,944
The other day when I came here....

588
00:45:39,856 --> 00:45:43,348
It was wrong,
and asking you about Megan....

589
00:45:43,426 --> 00:45:45,553
I have to stop putting you in the middle.

590
00:45:45,628 --> 00:45:49,530
lf I have questions about
my husband's life, I have to ask him.

591
00:45:52,635 --> 00:45:54,102
I'm sorry.

592
00:45:55,705 --> 00:45:57,468
And congratulations.

593
00:45:59,609 --> 00:46:00,769
Julia.

594
00:46:03,046 --> 00:46:06,106
What do you think?
Am I gonna be a good father?

595
00:46:09,452 --> 00:46:10,783
I hope so.

596
00:46:41,584 --> 00:46:42,573
