00:02:05,918 --> 00:02:07,283
<i>Previously on</i> Nip / Tuck:

2
00:02:07,486 --> 00:02:10,011
Dr. Troy? Grace Santiago.

3
00:02:11,724 --> 00:02:13,316
I'm the new psychologist.

4
00:02:13,726 --> 00:02:15,591
Instead of being angry...

5
00:02:16,528 --> 00:02:17,995
I'm going back to school.

6
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:20,464
Vanessa's a little hardbody, Matt.

7
00:02:20,699 --> 00:02:22,792
Looks like you're dating
a future prom queen.

8
00:02:22,868 --> 00:02:23,994
Congratulations.

9
00:02:49,628 --> 00:02:52,256
-Back again, Dr. Troy?
-Hello, Ron.

10
00:02:52,965 --> 00:02:56,526
You love the car.
Maybe it's time to make the commitment.

11
00:02:57,970 --> 00:03:01,371
The economy's in the toilet.
How can you be asking $250,000...

12
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,965
for something without
a two-bedroom half-bath?

13
00:03:05,744 --> 00:03:09,145
I could tell you,
or you could see for yourself.

14
00:03:36,709 --> 00:03:38,370
What do you think?

15
00:03:38,477 --> 00:03:41,310
Should we head back to the office
and do the paperwork?

16
00:03:41,413 --> 00:03:42,971
Maybe we could work something out.

17
00:03:43,048 --> 00:03:45,414
Doesn't your girlfriend
need some work done?

18
00:03:45,484 --> 00:03:46,781
She did.

19
00:03:47,219 --> 00:03:50,450
But she had her D-cups put in
last week by him.

20
00:03:57,696 --> 00:03:59,891
Tell me what you don't like about yourself.

21
00:03:59,965 --> 00:04:02,559
-My ass.
-You'd like liposuction?

22
00:04:02,968 --> 00:04:05,232
Don't need it. I'm cellulite free.

23
00:04:06,105 --> 00:04:09,336
-Then the problem is....
-She has a hematoma on her right cheek.

24
00:04:09,408 --> 00:04:11,171
We need to have it removed.

25
00:04:11,243 --> 00:04:12,835
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

26
00:04:12,911 --> 00:04:15,311
-Pleasure.
-I thought I had a bruise.

27
00:04:15,714 --> 00:04:17,477
A hematoma is a bruise, sweetie.

28
00:04:19,017 --> 00:04:21,144
When we met the other night, Shyanne...

29
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:23,882
you mentioned this resulted
from a work-related injury?

30
00:04:23,956 --> 00:04:28,154
Yeah, I slipped on the cheese dip
near the craft service table.

31
00:04:28,727 --> 00:04:30,388
So you make movies?

32
00:04:30,462 --> 00:04:33,056
-Have I seen any of your work?
-Maybe.

33
00:04:34,032 --> 00:04:36,592
Did you catch <i>Carnal Librarians lV?</i>

34
00:04:38,003 --> 00:04:39,834
<i>My Favorite Cucumber?</i>

35
00:04:39,905 --> 00:04:43,341
Miss Forsythe's production company
does pro-women adult films.

36
00:04:43,475 --> 00:04:47,036
Strong female leads, foreplay,
actual storytelling.

37
00:04:47,112 --> 00:04:48,704
Very classy stuff.

38
00:04:49,047 --> 00:04:52,380
Yes, and we start shooting
<i>Deflowering Petal</i> in about six weeks.

39
00:04:52,451 --> 00:04:54,749
She should be healed by then, correct?

40
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:57,812
I'm sorry. We're booked solid
for the next two months.

41
00:04:57,890 --> 00:05:00,051
Two months?
That's not what we discussed.

42
00:05:00,125 --> 00:05:01,149
I'd be happy--

43
00:05:01,226 --> 00:05:04,491
Since you have a deadline,
I'm sure we can rearrange our schedule.

44
00:05:04,563 --> 00:05:07,361
-How does next Thursday sound?
-Great.

45
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:12,698
Why did you do that?

46
00:05:12,771 --> 00:05:16,366
-We agreed to set new standards.
-We're living by your standards.

47
00:05:16,442 --> 00:05:18,000
If I did that, we'd be out of business.

48
00:05:18,076 --> 00:05:20,874
If word gets out
that we're working on a porn star...

49
00:05:20,946 --> 00:05:22,413
we lose potential patients.

50
00:05:22,481 --> 00:05:24,949
This business lives and dies
by word of mouth.

51
00:05:25,017 --> 00:05:27,485
Maybe if we advertised,
we wouldn't have a problem.

52
00:05:27,553 --> 00:05:30,351
-Bobolit has billboards all over Miami.
-Boob-o-la?

53
00:05:30,422 --> 00:05:33,152
You're worried about the man
who was last in our class?

54
00:05:33,325 --> 00:05:35,555
He has to advertise. He's a hack.

55
00:05:35,894 --> 00:05:39,091
And every time we turn people away,
he's taking our business.

56
00:05:39,164 --> 00:05:42,065
If we continue to do good work,
the clients will come.

57
00:05:42,134 --> 00:05:44,193
News flash, Sean. We're in a recession.

58
00:05:44,269 --> 00:05:48,933
People cut back first on luxury items
like sports cars and plastic surgery.

59
00:05:49,007 --> 00:05:51,669
So picking up actresses at parties
is gonna help us?

60
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:55,611
So hiring Grace is gonna help us?
So doing pro bono cases is gonna help us?

61
00:05:55,681 --> 00:05:57,945
I'm so sick of you
always shooting me down.

62
00:05:58,016 --> 00:05:59,381
Stop being such a prude.

63
00:05:59,451 --> 00:06:00,975
-I'm not a prude.
-Yes, you are.

64
00:06:01,053 --> 00:06:03,613
You're rattled
because that girl makes erotic films.

65
00:06:03,689 --> 00:06:06,055
Erotic films are when you use a feather.

66
00:06:06,124 --> 00:06:08,456
Porn films are when you use
the whole chicken.

67
00:06:08,894 --> 00:06:11,192
This girl's been through a lot of chickens.

68
00:06:13,665 --> 00:06:15,394
You know what, Sean?

69
00:06:15,467 --> 00:06:18,698
A tight ass might make money for her,
but not for us.

70
00:06:19,104 --> 00:06:20,503
We're taking this case.

71
00:06:23,942 --> 00:06:25,102
Prude?

72
00:07:49,728 --> 00:07:52,492
-Where are you going?
-First day of class.

73
00:07:53,098 --> 00:07:54,998
I don't wanna be late.

74
00:08:30,936 --> 00:08:33,928
Honey, I can't be late for my first day.

75
00:08:43,482 --> 00:08:44,471
Sorry.

76
00:08:53,659 --> 00:08:55,092
Are you lost?

77
00:08:55,761 --> 00:08:58,821
I thought it might be fun
to try something new.

78
00:08:59,631 --> 00:09:02,623
You know, so we don't feel like old prudes.

79
00:09:05,437 --> 00:09:08,497
Sean, are you trying to sabotage me?

80
00:09:08,573 --> 00:09:10,632
You know how important today is for me.

81
00:09:10,709 --> 00:09:13,269
You know,
my head is completely somewhere else.

82
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:16,739
I'm sorry, you're right.
I'll go make the coffee.

83
00:09:43,975 --> 00:09:47,536
lt kind of sucks, doesn't it,
being the oldest person in here?

84
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:50,577
I mean, look at me. I'm 26.

85
00:09:50,882 --> 00:09:53,373
I'm like an old man in front of these kids.

86
00:09:53,652 --> 00:09:55,882
You're the oldest person in here?

87
00:09:56,555 --> 00:09:58,682
What, you see somebody else?

88
00:09:59,658 --> 00:10:01,319
Wait, blue hair, 2:00.

89
00:10:03,662 --> 00:10:04,686
lris?

90
00:10:05,964 --> 00:10:08,728
Julia? Oh, my God.

91
00:10:08,834 --> 00:10:12,463
-How are you?
-I'm fine. What are you doing here?

92
00:10:12,637 --> 00:10:14,867
-This is my class.
-You're kidding.

93
00:10:14,973 --> 00:10:18,431
I thought I was gonna be
the only person my age here.

94
00:10:18,877 --> 00:10:21,471
We gotta catch up. You wanna sit down?

95
00:10:22,314 --> 00:10:24,839
Oh, no. I'm here to teach the class.

96
00:10:26,651 --> 00:10:27,879
You're the teacher?

97
00:10:28,019 --> 00:10:31,955
Actually, I'm really a doctor.
I only adjunct here once a semester.

98
00:10:32,023 --> 00:10:35,652
The last I saw you was graduation.
I thought you applied to medical school.

99
00:10:35,827 --> 00:10:40,059
Oh, yeah. But I got married instead.

100
00:10:40,298 --> 00:10:42,892
Two kids, family,
that whole thing, you know?

101
00:10:42,968 --> 00:10:45,436
My husband and I have one
in college already.

102
00:10:45,504 --> 00:10:46,766
Can you believe it?

103
00:10:47,205 --> 00:10:49,400
Listen, I'd love to get together.

104
00:10:50,609 --> 00:10:53,669
Call my office, and we'll set up some time.

105
00:10:56,348 --> 00:10:57,781
You look wonderful, Julia.

106
00:11:05,223 --> 00:11:07,282
You guys went to school together?

107
00:11:09,194 --> 00:11:11,025
I thought she was your mother.

108
00:11:14,266 --> 00:11:16,166
Good afternoon, Miss....

109
00:11:17,869 --> 00:11:19,268
Call me Sophia.

110
00:11:22,174 --> 00:11:24,665
Is fixing a tracheal shave painful?

111
00:11:26,077 --> 00:11:27,942
Honestly? Yes.

112
00:11:29,481 --> 00:11:32,917
I asked the original doctor about the scar.
He said there was--

113
00:11:32,984 --> 00:11:36,681
I'm not concerned with what
your original doctor said, Miss Lopez.

114
00:11:36,755 --> 00:11:40,919
Nearly 20°% of our work here
is cleaning up other people's mistakes.

115
00:11:41,526 --> 00:11:44,962
I'd like to make my own assessment,
if you don't mind.

116
00:11:53,972 --> 00:11:55,166
Ta-da.

117
00:11:58,977 --> 00:12:01,673
You have some keloids that have formed.

118
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:05,739
We might have to remove cartilage from
your ear to correct the contour deformity.

119
00:12:06,885 --> 00:12:08,079
My ear?

120
00:12:12,991 --> 00:12:15,323
If that's what it takes to fix this, okay.

121
00:12:16,228 --> 00:12:18,025
Can we talk about cost?

122
00:12:18,163 --> 00:12:20,028
When I spoke to your partner...

123
00:12:20,098 --> 00:12:24,660
he said that your office, especially you,
does free work sometimes...

124
00:12:25,237 --> 00:12:27,205
on a case-by-case basis.

125
00:12:28,106 --> 00:12:31,940
I'm afraid pro bono on this type
of operation is out of the question.

126
00:12:32,244 --> 00:12:33,802
We do that type of work...

127
00:12:33,879 --> 00:12:36,814
on people who have suffered
accidents or birth defects.

128
00:12:36,882 --> 00:12:39,578
Being one gender inside
and another on the outside...

129
00:12:39,651 --> 00:12:41,118
is a birth defect.

130
00:12:41,186 --> 00:12:43,017
You think I chose to look like this?

131
00:12:43,088 --> 00:12:45,454
Having elective surgery
for cosmetic reasons...

132
00:12:45,523 --> 00:12:49,254
regardless of the outcome,
is what I consider a choice, yes.

133
00:12:50,729 --> 00:12:52,424
Let's just be real, okay?

134
00:12:52,497 --> 00:12:54,590
Do you have a problem with me...

135
00:12:55,133 --> 00:12:57,294
that I'm a transgender individual?

136
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:01,266
-No.
-Then why are you being so uptight?

137
00:13:02,007 --> 00:13:05,204
The truth is, Doctor,
I don't care if you like me or if you don't.

138
00:13:05,277 --> 00:13:07,245
All I care about is feeling complete...

139
00:13:07,312 --> 00:13:10,179
and not having everybody look at me
like I'm a freak...

140
00:13:10,248 --> 00:13:12,546
the way you did
when I first walked in here.

141
00:13:18,890 --> 00:13:21,757
If I come up with the money,
will you do the operation?

142
00:13:32,404 --> 00:13:34,338
Christmas has come early.

143
00:13:34,472 --> 00:13:38,738
Compliments of Wallace in appreciation
of a job well done on Shyanne.

144
00:13:39,210 --> 00:13:43,169
Twenty of her top-selling DVDs
and an invitation to her silver jubilee.

145
00:13:44,182 --> 00:13:48,084
You can have the movies, my friend.
I'm gonna snag the RSVP.

146
00:13:48,186 --> 00:13:51,781
I'm gonna schmooze for some cooze
and land us an exclusive contract.

147
00:13:51,856 --> 00:13:53,414
Okay, enough, Christian.

148
00:13:53,525 --> 00:13:56,494
Enough with the porn stars,
and the transsexuals...

149
00:13:56,561 --> 00:13:58,927
and the nonstop libidinous assault.

150
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:00,825
Wallace might be a touch handsome...

151
00:14:00,899 --> 00:14:04,266
but I can assure you,
she's not a transsexual.

152
00:14:04,502 --> 00:14:06,265
But Sophia Lopez is.

153
00:14:06,938 --> 00:14:07,927
Who?

154
00:14:08,006 --> 00:14:10,566
The consult you purposely set me up with
an hour ago...

155
00:14:10,642 --> 00:14:13,406
to further prove your thesis
that I'm an uptight prig.

156
00:14:13,478 --> 00:14:15,673
I didn't know that consult
was a transsexual.

157
00:14:15,747 --> 00:14:18,181
She didn't give me that information
over the phone.

158
00:14:18,249 --> 00:14:21,844
-But, clearly, she made you feel uptight.
-I am not uptight.

159
00:14:22,253 --> 00:14:24,448
I'm sorry. I stand corrected.

160
00:14:24,889 --> 00:14:27,881
That said,
how does it feel to be judged unfairly...

161
00:14:27,959 --> 00:14:32,362
which is a daily battle waged by both
Wallace's girls and, I'm sure, Sophia...

162
00:14:32,430 --> 00:14:34,660
to be put in a box that doesn't define you?

163
00:14:35,266 --> 00:14:38,963
For your information,
I break out of that box all the time.

164
00:14:39,404 --> 00:14:41,235
ln fact, just this morning...

165
00:14:42,073 --> 00:14:45,065
Julia and I had unconventional sex.

166
00:14:49,581 --> 00:14:50,912
Is that so?

167
00:14:51,583 --> 00:14:52,777
How'd it go, killer?

168
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:57,051
lt didn't.

169
00:14:58,023 --> 00:15:03,017
I was clumsy and unconvincing,
and she was...horrified.

170
00:15:04,829 --> 00:15:06,797
I was trying to spice things up.

171
00:15:07,165 --> 00:15:10,157
Julia and I haven't
really been connecting lately...

172
00:15:10,235 --> 00:15:14,535
and now that she's gone back to school,
I'm afraid we'll become even more distant.

173
00:15:16,007 --> 00:15:18,908
How do you seduce women
into loosening up?

174
00:15:25,717 --> 00:15:28,811
It's about charm, Sean, and confidence.

175
00:15:29,954 --> 00:15:31,751
You wine, you dine, you romance.

176
00:15:33,291 --> 00:15:36,226
Julia needs that.
She's clearly starved for it.

177
00:15:36,294 --> 00:15:38,091
How do you know that?

178
00:15:39,898 --> 00:15:41,422
Every woman is.

179
00:15:53,978 --> 00:15:55,502
That's good.

180
00:16:02,187 --> 00:16:03,347
Sean?

181
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:09,449
ln here.

182
00:16:09,961 --> 00:16:12,293
Why are all the lights turned off?

183
00:16:16,768 --> 00:16:19,828
I thought I smelled cumin.
lndian food, cool.

184
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:24,900
Jude, this is my husband, Sean.

185
00:16:25,143 --> 00:16:26,838
Of course, the plastic surgeon.

186
00:16:27,212 --> 00:16:29,373
It's a pleasure. I've heard a lot about you.

187
00:16:29,447 --> 00:16:31,881
Thank you. I've heard nothing about you.

188
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:34,384
Jude and I are in biology together.

189
00:16:34,452 --> 00:16:37,979
We have a test
we were gonna study for tonight.

190
00:16:39,657 --> 00:16:41,386
I thought you were working late.

191
00:16:41,593 --> 00:16:43,117
I was, but l....

192
00:16:46,231 --> 00:16:47,721
You know what?

193
00:16:48,433 --> 00:16:50,924
We can do this tomorrow before class.

194
00:16:51,035 --> 00:16:52,900
I should probably get out of your hair.

195
00:16:52,971 --> 00:16:55,735
Wait, is that gonna give us
enough time to study?

196
00:16:59,210 --> 00:17:01,144
Then I'm sure that it will.

197
00:17:01,212 --> 00:17:04,147
-Okay, yeah. I'll give you a call.
-Jude, wait.

198
00:17:05,517 --> 00:17:06,916
I'm not that hungry.

199
00:17:07,452 --> 00:17:10,353
You guys dig in,
and get your studying done.

200
00:17:11,122 --> 00:17:12,316
Really?

201
00:17:18,296 --> 00:17:19,763
Are you sure?

202
00:17:20,798 --> 00:17:22,197
Positive.

203
00:17:23,134 --> 00:17:24,123
What's that?

204
00:17:24,636 --> 00:17:25,898
Research.

205
00:17:39,817 --> 00:17:42,718
She snuck something in the room,
underneath her gown.

206
00:17:51,729 --> 00:17:53,560
This is a sterile environment.

207
00:17:53,631 --> 00:17:57,032
You're risking an infection
by bringing something into this room.

208
00:17:57,101 --> 00:18:00,093
Either you hand over what you have,
or you find another surgeon.

209
00:18:00,171 --> 00:18:01,638
Your choice.

210
00:18:10,615 --> 00:18:12,480
That's my son, Raymond.

211
00:18:13,551 --> 00:18:14,882
I don't understand.

212
00:18:15,987 --> 00:18:19,514
When a man and a women
love each other, they have sex.

213
00:18:19,924 --> 00:18:21,152
And nine months later--

214
00:18:21,226 --> 00:18:23,387
You said you always knew
you were a woman.

215
00:18:23,795 --> 00:18:26,320
I didn't admit that to the world
back in the day.

216
00:18:26,397 --> 00:18:29,298
Amazing how far you'll go to live a lie,
isn't it?

217
00:18:30,168 --> 00:18:32,659
Does he know the truth
about who you are?

218
00:18:32,737 --> 00:18:35,865
He's the one person who didn't judge me
when I wanted to change.

219
00:18:36,074 --> 00:18:39,134
That's why I keep him close to me
at all times.

220
00:18:39,577 --> 00:18:41,204
Do you have kids?

221
00:18:42,814 --> 00:18:43,838
Two.

222
00:18:44,082 --> 00:18:45,947
It's a wonderful thing, isn't it...

223
00:18:47,652 --> 00:18:52,112
to have something in this world
that you love more than yourself?

224
00:18:55,493 --> 00:18:58,223
Take away the picture
and give me the gas.

225
00:18:58,363 --> 00:19:00,593
I understand. I'll be good.

226
00:19:11,442 --> 00:19:15,173
Put this in a plastic baggie
and let her hold it if she wants.

227
00:19:20,685 --> 00:19:22,710
Are they going to card me?

228
00:19:24,122 --> 00:19:26,249
Tonight, you're "plus one."

229
00:19:27,258 --> 00:19:29,158
Yeah. Just so you know...

230
00:19:29,227 --> 00:19:33,960
I'm thankful for the opportunity
to be your wingman.

231
00:19:36,868 --> 00:19:41,066
I'm here to work, not to play,
and you are here to learn a vital lesson.

232
00:19:41,139 --> 00:19:43,699
So what if your girlfriend turned out
to be a vegetarian?

233
00:19:43,775 --> 00:19:46,266
She's not the only tuna in the tank.

234
00:19:51,349 --> 00:19:52,714
Thank you.

235
00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:06,763
Shall we review the rules?

236
00:20:06,831 --> 00:20:09,664
-No drinking, no drugs.
-Good boy.

237
00:20:12,870 --> 00:20:14,804
Stay here. I'll be right back.

238
00:20:33,124 --> 00:20:35,558
Merrill, you look like a Q-Tip.

239
00:20:36,961 --> 00:20:39,930
I thought so,
but my personal shopper talked me into it.

240
00:20:39,997 --> 00:20:41,794
She said it was retro.

241
00:20:43,034 --> 00:20:45,594
That dumb bitch gets the boot on Monday.

242
00:20:47,105 --> 00:20:48,697
Smooth operator, that Wallace.

243
00:20:48,773 --> 00:20:52,402
I take it she invited both of us
so we could put in competitive bids.

244
00:20:52,477 --> 00:20:55,207
Or are you still a party crasher
like you were in college?

245
00:20:55,279 --> 00:20:58,407
I'm pleased to announce
these days I walk through the front door.

246
00:20:58,483 --> 00:21:01,646
I guess the bouncers around town
take pity on those hair plugs.

247
00:21:02,186 --> 00:21:04,154
Or have you sunk to palming hundreds?

248
00:21:04,222 --> 00:21:07,953
Since my billboard went up, all the
bouncers know me on a first-name basis.

249
00:21:08,025 --> 00:21:10,892
-Is that right?
-Fame is power, my friend.

250
00:21:10,962 --> 00:21:15,592
Free entry, comped drinks,
the hottest available poonanny.

251
00:21:16,601 --> 00:21:18,398
I am living the life.

252
00:21:19,871 --> 00:21:22,032
-How are you guys doing?
-Great.

253
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:24,364
Business is booming.

254
00:21:24,442 --> 00:21:26,910
Is that right? That's not what I hear.

255
00:21:26,978 --> 00:21:29,742
Has cheap fame
made you omnipotent, Merrill?

256
00:21:29,814 --> 00:21:32,044
You can make fun all you want, slick...

257
00:21:32,116 --> 00:21:35,176
but the billboards tripled my business
in the past month.

258
00:21:35,253 --> 00:21:37,187
I work 18-hour days just to keep up.

259
00:21:37,255 --> 00:21:39,815
-Sounds exhausting.
-Sounds like I need a partner.

260
00:21:41,426 --> 00:21:43,417
Was that an offer, Merrill?

261
00:21:44,796 --> 00:21:47,560
Maybe you and l
can have lunch some time.

262
00:21:49,867 --> 00:21:51,732
That would be a consolatory meal...

263
00:21:51,803 --> 00:21:54,704
because I'm going to kick your ass
and win this contract.

264
00:21:54,839 --> 00:21:57,501
You're a better surgeon than me,
I'll give you that...

265
00:21:57,575 --> 00:22:00,271
but you're no longer a better salesman.

266
00:22:24,435 --> 00:22:27,871
-I like the outfit.
-Really? Thanks.

267
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:32,168
You need to stand out in this business
if you're going to make it.

268
00:22:32,243 --> 00:22:33,904
Have, like, a gimmick.

269
00:22:33,978 --> 00:22:36,572
That's why I'm always sucking
on something.

270
00:22:37,682 --> 00:22:39,912
Oh, my God. That sounded awful.

271
00:22:41,285 --> 00:22:43,446
Are you in this business, too?

272
00:22:45,022 --> 00:22:46,580
I'm an agent.

273
00:22:49,126 --> 00:22:51,321
So I guess you want to be an actress.

274
00:22:52,630 --> 00:22:53,858
I'm trying to be.

275
00:22:54,198 --> 00:22:56,257
Wallace has a strict star system now.

276
00:22:56,334 --> 00:22:59,394
She says you got to start
at the bottom and work your way up.

277
00:22:59,470 --> 00:23:01,734
So right now, I'm a fluffer.

278
00:23:04,175 --> 00:23:07,770
So tell me, what exactly does
a fluffer of your caliber do?

279
00:23:07,845 --> 00:23:11,781
Give head to guys to keep them hard
and stuff in between shots.

280
00:23:12,583 --> 00:23:13,743
Cool.

281
00:23:15,786 --> 00:23:20,120
So fluffing all day, that's got to be
a real turnoff after a while, right?

282
00:23:22,927 --> 00:23:27,296
Actually it gets me really horny.

283
00:23:30,968 --> 00:23:33,801
That's why I have
to keep sucking on these.

284
00:23:51,956 --> 00:23:53,719
So, what happens now?

285
00:24:08,339 --> 00:24:11,331
I tried to stop her from packing,
but I can't reason with her.

286
00:24:11,409 --> 00:24:14,207
-Mrs. Kuzman, where are you going?
-Home.

287
00:24:14,378 --> 00:24:17,176
What kind of brothel are you running here?

288
00:24:30,261 --> 00:24:31,660
She's got a point.

289
00:24:34,131 --> 00:24:37,225
Look, Ronnie, I want the car.
I just signed a big contract.

290
00:24:37,301 --> 00:24:41,499
But you're going to have to work with me.
It's still obscenely pricey.

291
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:44,940
Let me call you back. Thanks.

292
00:24:45,376 --> 00:24:48,345
Mrs. Kuzman just stormed out of here,
and I don't blame her.

293
00:24:48,412 --> 00:24:51,404
-Why'd she leave?
-Go look in our recovery room, Christian.

294
00:24:51,482 --> 00:24:55,111
lt looks like we're running a casting call
for <i>Messy Mouths ll.</i>

295
00:24:55,653 --> 00:24:57,644
-Excuse me.
-You're overreacting.

296
00:24:57,722 --> 00:25:00,156
Wallace has guaranteed us
10 of her girls a month.

297
00:25:00,224 --> 00:25:04,320
That's implants, lipo, reductions.
Who gives a shit if Kuzman bolted?

298
00:25:04,428 --> 00:25:07,886
It's one thing to bring business in.
It's another to drive it away.

299
00:25:07,965 --> 00:25:10,490
Take off your judgmental blinders, Sean.

300
00:25:10,568 --> 00:25:14,698
The line that divides the porn industry
and plastic surgery is a thin one.

301
00:25:14,772 --> 00:25:17,764
-We're both selling fantasy, aren't we?
-Can I say something?

302
00:25:17,842 --> 00:25:19,503
From a patient's perspective...

303
00:25:19,577 --> 00:25:23,377
it's very important to feel comfortable
in your surroundings, post-surgery.

304
00:25:23,447 --> 00:25:26,939
See? It's a psychological issue as well.
That settles it.

305
00:25:27,018 --> 00:25:30,317
We can't provide proper medical care
for most of our patients...

306
00:25:30,388 --> 00:25:32,481
by taking on a contract that offends them.

307
00:25:32,556 --> 00:25:34,786
-Then they'll go to Bobolit.
-Fine.

308
00:25:37,928 --> 00:25:41,386
You haven't been here long enough
to put in your two cents.

309
00:25:41,666 --> 00:25:44,692
Let me explain something to you,
Dr. Santiago.

310
00:25:44,869 --> 00:25:47,235
Without Wallace, we're losing money...

311
00:25:47,438 --> 00:25:50,066
and that means cutting back
on gratuitous expenses...

312
00:25:50,141 --> 00:25:51,870
like excess employees.

313
00:26:00,051 --> 00:26:02,952
<i>Dr. McNamara? Sophia Lopez, line three.</i>

314
00:26:06,857 --> 00:26:09,223
Dr. McNamara? I'm at Dade County.

315
00:26:09,694 --> 00:26:11,787
Something terrible has happened.

316
00:26:14,331 --> 00:26:17,266
Sophia Lopez just called from emergency.
Some sort of problem.

317
00:26:17,334 --> 00:26:19,097
Can you keep an eye on things?

318
00:26:19,170 --> 00:26:20,933
Sure. Absolutely.

319
00:26:26,877 --> 00:26:28,868
Merrill. Christian Troy.

320
00:26:29,346 --> 00:26:32,042
I'd like to take you up on that lunch offer.

321
00:26:37,621 --> 00:26:39,282
-What is it?
-I need your help.

322
00:26:39,356 --> 00:26:40,414
-It's Marcy.
-Who?

323
00:26:40,491 --> 00:26:42,982
Marcy, my best friend. She's in trouble.

324
00:26:44,028 --> 00:26:47,225
A week ago,
she had a gender reassignment surgery...

325
00:26:47,298 --> 00:26:50,734
by the same doctor who did my neck.
She's been bleeding.

326
00:26:53,204 --> 00:26:55,638
What's the opinion of the doctor
who examined her?

327
00:26:55,706 --> 00:26:59,665
The nurse stuck us in here two hours ago.
Nobody wants to touch her.

328
00:26:59,944 --> 00:27:01,605
I think I'm dying.

329
00:27:13,390 --> 00:27:15,654
I'd like to take a look, if that's okay.

330
00:27:24,702 --> 00:27:28,604
-Have you dilated today?
-No. Am I supposed to do that?

331
00:27:29,173 --> 00:27:31,641
-What's going on here?
-This woman's hemorrhaging.

332
00:27:31,709 --> 00:27:33,574
You need to get her into surgery now.

333
00:27:33,644 --> 00:27:36,704
-What are you, a doctor?
-Apparently the only one on this floor.

334
00:27:36,781 --> 00:27:39,375
Why hasn't this patient been cared for?

335
00:27:41,252 --> 00:27:44,585
Do you have a problem
with her being a transsexual?

336
00:27:44,955 --> 00:27:48,447
We're really backed up right now.
I'll see what I can do.

337
00:27:59,069 --> 00:28:01,765
Sophia, go wait in the lobby.

338
00:28:08,612 --> 00:28:11,046
-Hello?
-Hit the switch to your left.

339
00:28:21,091 --> 00:28:22,649
I got your message.

340
00:28:26,297 --> 00:28:28,424
I know why you wanted to meet me today.

341
00:28:29,433 --> 00:28:31,492
Because I told you I was an agent.

342
00:28:33,137 --> 00:28:34,798
The truth is...

343
00:28:37,174 --> 00:28:38,163
I'm not.

344
00:28:38,943 --> 00:28:40,467
You lied to me?

345
00:28:41,478 --> 00:28:45,812
I know you want help with your career
and that's why you called me, but....

346
00:28:47,284 --> 00:28:48,649
But you know what?

347
00:28:48,719 --> 00:28:51,916
You got a great gimmick,
so I'm sure you're gonna....

348
00:28:57,228 --> 00:28:58,889
It's okay. What's wrong?

349
00:29:00,731 --> 00:29:02,596
I went to the doctor...

350
00:29:03,834 --> 00:29:06,769
and I'm sick.

351
00:29:12,509 --> 00:29:14,067
I got NGU.

352
00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:17,169
NGU?

353
00:29:18,048 --> 00:29:20,812
Nongonococcal urethritis.

354
00:29:26,056 --> 00:29:29,389
Some guy I was fluffing
must have given it to me.

355
00:29:32,630 --> 00:29:34,757
That means I gave it to you.

356
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:44,970
I don't have any symptoms.

357
00:29:47,845 --> 00:29:48,834
Yet.

358
00:29:55,119 --> 00:29:59,317
And this is where I get my freak on
when the parties move outside.

359
00:30:01,191 --> 00:30:03,489
Good thing you're rich, Merrill.

360
00:30:03,627 --> 00:30:04,787
Nice place.

361
00:30:04,862 --> 00:30:06,955
My problem is
I'm never around to enjoy it.

362
00:30:07,031 --> 00:30:10,364
I'm working seven days a week.
That's where you come in.

363
00:30:12,970 --> 00:30:14,062
I'm listening.

364
00:30:14,138 --> 00:30:18,040
By myself, I've managed to become the
biggest plastic surgeon in south Florida...

365
00:30:18,475 --> 00:30:22,809
but with your skills, we can be
the surgical destination for half the globe.

366
00:30:22,947 --> 00:30:25,541
I'm talking Hollywood elite,
European royalty.

367
00:30:25,616 --> 00:30:29,450
We charge twice the price
and get all the time off we need.

368
00:30:29,853 --> 00:30:32,048
All you got to do is bring your talent.

369
00:30:32,356 --> 00:30:34,085
What am I worth to you, Merrill?

370
00:30:34,158 --> 00:30:37,423
You want numbers?
I'll get my lawyers to draft an agreement.

371
00:30:40,130 --> 00:30:41,620
I want parity.

372
00:30:41,765 --> 00:30:45,496
I want a guarantee that all decisions
are arrived at by both partners...

373
00:30:45,569 --> 00:30:47,264
and I want it in writing.

374
00:30:47,504 --> 00:30:48,869
No problem.

375
00:30:49,106 --> 00:30:50,937
This is a good move for you.

376
00:30:51,008 --> 00:30:55,502
Those cleft palates Sean's bringing in
ain't helping you retire early, okay?

377
00:30:56,213 --> 00:30:58,272
Don't get me wrong. I like Sean.

378
00:30:58,482 --> 00:31:01,144
He's a conservative family man,
and that's great...

379
00:31:01,285 --> 00:31:02,843
but you and I are more alike.

380
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:05,350
We're ambitious, single, good-looking.

381
00:31:05,422 --> 00:31:09,756
And we understand that in business,
success is the only standard.

382
00:31:11,028 --> 00:31:14,088
Merrill, my friend Heidi
wants to come swimming.

383
00:31:14,231 --> 00:31:16,096
Can we go pick her up?

384
00:31:18,469 --> 00:31:20,528
She's going to have to sit on your lap.

385
00:31:20,738 --> 00:31:24,469
Screw that. You drive. She'll sit on my lap.
You've got to see the car.

386
00:31:31,749 --> 00:31:34,718
Can you believe it?
$250,000 and no back seat.

387
00:31:35,019 --> 00:31:36,543
Who would want one of these?

388
00:31:36,620 --> 00:31:38,645
-Not me.
-Well, you can't.

389
00:31:38,789 --> 00:31:40,848
Monterey blue. They only made three.

390
00:31:41,291 --> 00:31:43,725
Call me this week. I want an answer.

391
00:32:07,951 --> 00:32:09,919
Is she going to be okay?

392
00:32:10,187 --> 00:32:11,984
She's in surgery now.

393
00:32:12,156 --> 00:32:14,590
Another 24 hours,
an infection could have set in.

394
00:32:14,658 --> 00:32:16,956
That would have been a problem.

395
00:32:20,464 --> 00:32:23,729
I want to know
the name of the doctor who did this.

396
00:32:23,967 --> 00:32:27,130
He does a lot of work
on transgender individuals.

397
00:32:27,438 --> 00:32:28,996
He's known in the community.

398
00:32:30,441 --> 00:32:33,001
You have to file a malpractice suit.

399
00:32:33,410 --> 00:32:37,744
-Why would you protect this butcher?
-I'm not protecting him. I'm protecting us.

400
00:32:39,950 --> 00:32:42,043
You saw how the doctors treated us here?

401
00:32:42,119 --> 00:32:45,384
How you treated me
when I first came in to see you?

402
00:32:47,124 --> 00:32:49,854
If we go to court,
we'll be judged, paraded...

403
00:32:50,828 --> 00:32:52,693
like freaks, deviants.

404
00:32:55,599 --> 00:32:57,191
I won't do that.

405
00:32:58,969 --> 00:33:01,460
What if next time he kills someone?

406
00:33:02,039 --> 00:33:04,439
You want that on your conscience?

407
00:33:07,744 --> 00:33:09,974
What if that person were you, Sophia?

408
00:33:11,315 --> 00:33:12,680
Think about your son.

409
00:33:13,283 --> 00:33:15,046
Think about Raymond.

410
00:33:16,487 --> 00:33:17,954
He loves you.

411
00:33:19,056 --> 00:33:20,546
He needs you around.

412
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:24,754
I'll help you.

413
00:33:25,762 --> 00:33:27,923
I'll make all the calls.

414
00:33:28,198 --> 00:33:30,632
I'll testify in court so you don't have to.

415
00:33:33,604 --> 00:33:35,936
Just give me this doctor's name.

416
00:33:37,841 --> 00:33:41,106
Dr. Marcus Grayson.

417
00:34:02,199 --> 00:34:05,657
What are you doing? I've been looking
for this book all afternoon.

418
00:34:05,736 --> 00:34:08,136
I have a test coming up tomorrow.

419
00:34:12,876 --> 00:34:14,776
Why were you reading this?

420
00:34:19,149 --> 00:34:21,014
You can't tell Dad. Promise me.

421
00:34:21,118 --> 00:34:24,952
We've been getting along so much better,
and he'd just be so disappointed in me.

422
00:34:25,022 --> 00:34:26,990
I am disappointed in you, too, Matt.

423
00:34:27,658 --> 00:34:29,751
How could you have sex
without wearing a rubber?

424
00:34:29,826 --> 00:34:32,954
-You're smarter than that.
-She almost dragged me into the closet.

425
00:34:33,030 --> 00:34:35,362
-What was I supposed to do?
-You say no, Matt.

426
00:34:35,432 --> 00:34:38,697
What in the hell were you thinking,
bringing him to a porn party?

427
00:34:38,769 --> 00:34:41,465
Julia, she's a client.
I was there on business.

428
00:34:41,572 --> 00:34:44,370
He needs to be tested for HlV, too.

429
00:34:45,576 --> 00:34:47,305
Why would you say that?

430
00:34:47,978 --> 00:34:50,412
Do you think she gave that to me, too?

431
00:34:50,914 --> 00:34:52,814
You're going to be fine.

432
00:34:52,883 --> 00:34:55,317
At worst, you've got a bacterial infection.

433
00:34:55,385 --> 00:34:58,411
We'll start you
on doxycycline as a precaution.

434
00:34:58,488 --> 00:35:00,649
It'll clear up within a week.

435
00:35:00,724 --> 00:35:03,716
You want to go wait for me
in the car, please?

436
00:35:10,534 --> 00:35:12,934
I'm sorry. You're right.
I shouldn't have brought--

437
00:35:13,003 --> 00:35:14,937
What you do with your life...

438
00:35:15,005 --> 00:35:17,872
and where you stick your dick
is your business.

439
00:35:17,941 --> 00:35:22,105
What you do with Matt is mine.
From now on, you stay away from him !

440
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:25,143
You're being way too dramatic.

441
00:35:25,215 --> 00:35:28,116
Come on.
You can't lay down a law like that.

442
00:35:28,252 --> 00:35:29,685
Matt's like a son to me.

443
00:35:29,753 --> 00:35:31,687
And he is a son to me...

444
00:35:31,755 --> 00:35:34,747
and a real father
would never do what you've done.

445
00:35:35,058 --> 00:35:38,186
You'll never be capable
of being a real father, Christian.

446
00:35:38,262 --> 00:35:39,456
Want to know why?

447
00:35:39,529 --> 00:35:43,590
Because real fathers
would never turn someone they love...

448
00:35:43,667 --> 00:35:46,932
into a filth-loving
moral-less bottom feeder.

449
00:35:47,871 --> 00:35:52,831
Real fathers want their sons to be
more than they are, not carbon copies.

450
00:36:29,079 --> 00:36:31,843
Hello, Marcus. It's been awhile.

451
00:36:38,488 --> 00:36:41,082
You know how delicate GRS is, Sean.

452
00:36:41,358 --> 00:36:43,349
Fistulas are fairly common...

453
00:36:43,427 --> 00:36:46,021
when you're dealing
with vaginal construction.

454
00:36:46,096 --> 00:36:48,496
-I'm sure....
-Marcy.

455
00:36:49,066 --> 00:36:52,058
Right. I'm sure she's just going to be fine.

456
00:36:52,469 --> 00:36:55,768
You know, I still have
all my notes from your class.

457
00:36:55,939 --> 00:36:57,930
Why aren't you teaching anymore?

458
00:36:58,008 --> 00:37:00,977
Well, when the university...

459
00:37:02,279 --> 00:37:04,304
denied me tenure...

460
00:37:05,148 --> 00:37:07,616
I went back into private practice.

461
00:37:07,984 --> 00:37:10,111
Then about five years ago...

462
00:37:11,021 --> 00:37:14,855
I had to deal
with this malpractice bullshit...

463
00:37:15,792 --> 00:37:17,054
and it killed me.

464
00:37:17,761 --> 00:37:19,160
Didn't you have insurance?

465
00:37:19,229 --> 00:37:21,459
I did. I can't afford it now.

466
00:37:22,566 --> 00:37:25,126
Marcus, that's crazy.

467
00:37:25,635 --> 00:37:29,662
It's no crazier than half the stuff
they do down in Mexico...

468
00:37:30,307 --> 00:37:34,209
which is where most of these transsexuals
go because they can't afford it up here.

469
00:37:34,277 --> 00:37:37,269
It's too expensive.
I at least offer an alternative.

470
00:37:37,347 --> 00:37:41,511
But if you can't do the job right,
what kind of alternative is that?

471
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:44,847
Excuse me?

472
00:37:45,288 --> 00:37:47,017
Look at this place.

473
00:37:47,357 --> 00:37:49,985
I can see why you're having problems
with these surgeries.

474
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:54,224
Don't talk to me like that, Sean.
I was a doctor before you were born.

475
00:37:55,298 --> 00:37:58,927
I almost invented
most of these procedures, remember?

476
00:37:59,770 --> 00:38:01,965
No, this is not Johns Hopkins...

477
00:38:02,038 --> 00:38:04,768
but I can do
what most other surgeons can't.

478
00:38:04,841 --> 00:38:08,572
Now, you had a great deal of skill,
but you had no bravado...

479
00:38:09,312 --> 00:38:11,371
and it takes a combination of the two...

480
00:38:11,448 --> 00:38:14,906
bravado and skill
in order to be a brilliant surgeon.

481
00:38:14,985 --> 00:38:17,453
I'd rather be a good surgeon
who helps people...

482
00:38:17,521 --> 00:38:19,614
than a brilliant surgeon who hurts them.

483
00:38:20,424 --> 00:38:22,688
Is this about what I do...

484
00:38:23,293 --> 00:38:25,591
or do you have a problem
with who I do it to?

485
00:38:26,963 --> 00:38:28,692
I think you have the problem.

486
00:38:28,765 --> 00:38:32,496
What I have a problem with
is you destroying people's lives.

487
00:38:33,303 --> 00:38:34,702
Look at you.

488
00:38:35,205 --> 00:38:37,264
Can you even hold your hands steady?

489
00:38:37,407 --> 00:38:38,840
You reek of alcohol.

490
00:38:38,942 --> 00:38:41,968
Don't confuse yourself
into thinking you're a hero...

491
00:38:42,045 --> 00:38:43,876
working on the disenfranchised.

492
00:38:43,947 --> 00:38:46,211
You're just a sad old drunk
who can't retire...

493
00:38:46,283 --> 00:38:49,582
because he doesn't have
anything else to hold onto.

494
00:39:00,797 --> 00:39:03,857
You're the one who inspired me
to be a surgeon.

495
00:39:04,968 --> 00:39:06,697
I wanted to be you.

496
00:39:10,707 --> 00:39:12,607
You're gonna be me, Sean.

497
00:39:15,212 --> 00:39:16,941
You are on my path.

498
00:39:22,252 --> 00:39:23,879
You're a success now.

499
00:39:24,321 --> 00:39:26,687
Forty is when it starts.

500
00:39:29,626 --> 00:39:33,084
The dutiful wife gets tired of your hours...

501
00:39:33,163 --> 00:39:35,893
and your lack of emotional intelligence.

502
00:39:36,967 --> 00:39:40,630
She'll stay around for another five years,
if you're lucky.

503
00:39:40,704 --> 00:39:43,434
Mine left when I was 50, but she'll leave.

504
00:39:44,574 --> 00:39:49,307
When Father's Day comes around,
and Christmas, and Thanksgiving...

505
00:39:49,379 --> 00:39:51,847
and you sit alone with your...

506
00:39:53,550 --> 00:39:54,539
diplomas...

507
00:39:55,619 --> 00:39:59,953
and the thoughts of all these people
whose lives you've saved...

508
00:40:00,023 --> 00:40:01,183
except your own.

509
00:40:01,258 --> 00:40:03,658
So, yes, I drink.

510
00:40:07,464 --> 00:40:10,991
Either you shut yourself down, or I will.

511
00:40:17,107 --> 00:40:20,304
Sean, I didn't mean to hurt anybody.

512
00:40:22,846 --> 00:40:25,178
God help me. I didn't mean to.

513
00:40:33,890 --> 00:40:37,053
-So, where are you?
-Take a look to your right.

514
00:40:50,206 --> 00:40:51,571
Is that your car?

515
00:40:52,242 --> 00:40:54,540
I landed an exclusive contract.

516
00:40:54,744 --> 00:40:57,872
Thought I'd treat myself.
I'm leaving it to you in my will.

517
00:40:57,948 --> 00:41:01,042
That is not the only reason
to celebrate, Matty.

518
00:41:01,284 --> 00:41:06,278
Your test came back from the lab.
You are as clean as the day you were born.

519
00:41:07,924 --> 00:41:09,516
Oh, my God.

520
00:41:11,094 --> 00:41:12,994
-Seriously?
-Seriously.

521
00:41:13,797 --> 00:41:15,094
I'm proud of you, kid.

522
00:41:15,165 --> 00:41:17,690
You cheated your first STD. Way to go.

523
00:41:17,901 --> 00:41:19,562
Don't do it again.

524
00:41:20,870 --> 00:41:22,997
Your mom's probably calmed down
by now.

525
00:41:23,073 --> 00:41:25,974
I thought we'd go over
and tell her the good news together.

526
00:41:26,076 --> 00:41:27,407
You drive.

527
00:41:29,579 --> 00:41:31,410
You're gonna love this car.

528
00:41:32,148 --> 00:41:36,244
Swear to God, you drive down the street,
the girls are going to follow you home.

529
00:41:41,091 --> 00:41:43,457
Look, no, thanks.

530
00:41:46,930 --> 00:41:50,422
I don't want to meet girls
because of the car I drive...

531
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:54,459
or pick them up
at strip clubs or porn parties.

532
00:41:56,906 --> 00:41:58,533
I'm not you, man.

533
00:42:01,311 --> 00:42:04,212
-I was only trying to cheer you up.
-Yeah, I know.

534
00:42:10,020 --> 00:42:12,420
Look, I got last period, so I gotta....

535
00:42:12,589 --> 00:42:14,887
-I gotta head off.
-Wait.

536
00:42:15,592 --> 00:42:17,583
Maybe we could go
see a movie or something.

537
00:42:17,661 --> 00:42:20,459
You gotta at least go for a ride with me.

538
00:42:23,166 --> 00:42:24,633
I'll see you.

539
00:42:39,282 --> 00:42:41,614
Keep out of the sun for at least
three weeks...

540
00:42:41,685 --> 00:42:44,153
and remember to put the ointment on.

541
00:42:44,220 --> 00:42:46,017
But otherwise, it's very...

542
00:42:47,924 --> 00:42:48,913
feminine.

543
00:42:49,959 --> 00:42:51,426
You think so?

544
00:43:02,138 --> 00:43:04,231
What happened to Dr. Grayson?

545
00:43:04,340 --> 00:43:05,807
He's retired.

546
00:43:10,313 --> 00:43:11,575
It's okay.

547
00:43:12,015 --> 00:43:14,142
He won't hurt anybody again.

548
00:43:15,118 --> 00:43:18,144
I talked to one girl.
He did a good job on her.

549
00:43:18,588 --> 00:43:20,681
Maybe he doesn't always drink.

550
00:43:20,824 --> 00:43:22,189
You're not....

551
00:43:25,595 --> 00:43:29,087
Sophia, his office was unsanitary.

552
00:43:29,165 --> 00:43:32,066
-His practices--
-I know that.

553
00:43:32,902 --> 00:43:36,360
I also know I'm a bank teller
who makes no money...

554
00:43:36,940 --> 00:43:39,909
who hasn't yet become
who she's supposed to become.

555
00:43:48,985 --> 00:43:51,112
I'll help you find that person...

556
00:43:51,955 --> 00:43:52,979
free of charge.

557
00:44:01,898 --> 00:44:03,661
You'll be my doctor?

558
00:44:05,602 --> 00:44:07,194
Are you serious?

559
00:44:16,980 --> 00:44:20,177
You're very progressive,
Dr. Sean McNamara.

560
00:44:36,533 --> 00:44:38,694
It's Christian. Can you hang on a second?

561
00:44:40,136 --> 00:44:41,125
What's up?

562
00:44:41,304 --> 00:44:43,829
I'm ready to revisit
the Wallace Forsythe issue.

563
00:44:43,907 --> 00:44:44,965
Why?

564
00:44:45,208 --> 00:44:48,177
I've come to the conclusion
that with money flowing in...

565
00:44:48,244 --> 00:44:50,644
we're free to take on more pro bono.

566
00:44:51,114 --> 00:44:53,878
Additionally, I think you're right.

567
00:44:54,984 --> 00:44:56,747
I need to loosen up.

568
00:44:56,953 --> 00:44:59,683
So what if they're in porn.
They're not hurting anybody.

569
00:44:59,756 --> 00:45:01,121
Yes, they are.

570
00:45:03,026 --> 00:45:05,824
I terminated that contract this afternoon.

571
00:45:05,895 --> 00:45:07,419
What are you talking about?

572
00:45:07,497 --> 00:45:11,900
We have standards here, Sean, that are
more important than making money.

573
00:45:13,369 --> 00:45:15,030
What made you change your mind?

574
00:45:16,639 --> 00:45:17,799
You.

575
00:45:24,414 --> 00:45:27,247
-I'm kind of in the middle of something.
-Sure.

576
00:45:35,992 --> 00:45:37,186
Sorry about that.

577
00:45:37,260 --> 00:45:41,594
So Wallace Forsythe calls me this morning
and says she's bringing me her business.

578
00:45:41,965 --> 00:45:44,991
<i>-Does that mean you're coming with her?</i>
-Not today, Merrill.

579
00:45:45,068 --> 00:45:47,468
You're kidding me.
I'm up to my ass in tit jobs.

580
00:45:47,537 --> 00:45:48,970
I need you.

581
00:45:49,038 --> 00:45:50,938
The timing's not right.

582
00:45:53,109 --> 00:45:54,576
I understand.

583
00:45:54,744 --> 00:45:56,541
<i>My door's always open, Christian.</i>

584
00:45:56,613 --> 00:45:59,582
You let me know
when you're ready to walk through it.

585
00:46:12,395 --> 00:46:14,886
Not a ding and only 50 miles on it.

586
00:46:15,098 --> 00:46:17,293
But I think you're making a mistake.

587
00:46:17,367 --> 00:46:20,461
This car tells the whole world
who you've become.

588
00:46:20,737 --> 00:46:22,932
Which is why I'm returning it.

589
00:46:35,952 --> 00:46:38,250
Thanks again for making dinner.

590
00:46:39,422 --> 00:46:42,550
We'll get you to ace that next test, Jules.
Don't worry.

591
00:46:42,792 --> 00:46:45,625
I don't care how much pasta I have to boil.

592
00:46:56,205 --> 00:47:00,801
So, guess what I found
under the bed this morning?

593
00:47:05,682 --> 00:47:07,343
You want to watch?

594
00:47:09,552 --> 00:47:11,349
We have a new client...

595
00:47:11,721 --> 00:47:14,189
and I need to brush up
on these procedures.

596
00:47:15,325 --> 00:47:18,556
-Maybe this weekend?
-Sure.

597
00:48:04,941 --> 00:48:06,431
Come in.

598
00:48:40,476 --> 00:48:41,568
Rip youyoup
