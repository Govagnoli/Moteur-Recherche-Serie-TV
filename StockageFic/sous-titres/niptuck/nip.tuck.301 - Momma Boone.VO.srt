1
00:00:03,015 --> 00:00:04,713
- The carver...
- Oh, no !

2
00:00:04,713 --> 00:00:06,974
That's what they're calling him.

3
00:00:06,974 --> 00:00:10,311
- Isn't that clever ?
- My looks were his bait.

4
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:15,431
Repair another one of my masterpieces again, and the next time, I'll kill you.

5
00:00:15,431 --> 00:00:18,901
We found this next to the carved face of a teenage girl.

6
00:00:18,901 --> 00:00:20,262
It's a dare.

7
00:00:20,648 --> 00:00:22,826
Her parents asked for me specifically.

8
00:00:22,826 --> 00:00:27,184
Her parents don't know that he's threatened to kill you if you correct his work.

9
00:00:27,184 --> 00:00:29,532
Make sure you lock this door.

10
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,738
Beauty is a curse on the world.

11
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:00,363
Excuse me, sir.
No, it's ok.

12
00:01:00,363 --> 00:01:03,188
- It's ok.
- Come on.

13
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:14,695
Are you ready for this, doctor ?

14
00:01:15,991 --> 00:01:17,033
Yeah.

15
00:01:18,028 --> 00:01:19,991
All right. Come on.

16
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,669
Give us a minute, people.
Back up.

17
00:01:46,839 --> 00:01:51,977
That's him. That's... that's Christian.

18
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:40,138
Christian...

19
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:45,901
was complicated.

20
00:02:47,233 --> 00:02:52,281
But to me, he was family.

21
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:58,523
He was so beautiful and not just on the outside.

22
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:01,157
I wish he could have known that.

23
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:04,117
He's the only straight man I ever met

24
00:03:04,117 --> 00:03:07,422
who was arrogant enough to think that he could convert me.

25
00:03:09,373 --> 00:03:11,116
Sometimes, I hated the guy.

26
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:14,959
But most of the time, I loved him.

27
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:16,681
I loved him.

28
00:03:16,681 --> 00:03:17,932
I loved him.

29
00:03:37,997 --> 00:03:40,941
My first memory was asking my mother for a brother.

30
00:03:42,954 --> 00:03:45,387
I finally got one when I was 18.

31
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:51,954
His name was Christian Troy, and I loved him.

32
00:03:53,677 --> 00:03:57,013
Christian was flawed, but he lived.

33
00:03:58,574 --> 00:04:02,723
I just want to go to work and see his blinding smile

34
00:04:03,303 --> 00:04:04,604
and tell him

35
00:04:05,709 --> 00:04:10,346
how hard it's gonna be for me to see a future without him.

36
00:04:15,639 --> 00:04:16,874
I just...

37
00:04:18,451 --> 00:04:22,603
I want to talk to my brother.
I want...

38
00:05:28,404 --> 00:05:29,966
And that's when I wake up.

39
00:05:32,419 --> 00:05:34,492
How many times have you had this dream ?

40
00:05:34,492 --> 00:05:36,505
Every couple of nights since the attack.

41
00:05:37,653 --> 00:05:39,223
What do you think it's about ?

42
00:05:40,955 --> 00:05:42,176
Don't you get it ?

43
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:43,964
I'm stuck.

44
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:47,782
Even in my dreams, at my own goddamn funeral, I can't move on.

45
00:05:49,622 --> 00:05:53,215
I'm in limbo.
Some swank limbo, Christian.

46
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:56,470
$20,000 a month beach house rental.

47
00:05:56,470 --> 00:05:59,284
Kimber coming by with a hot meal every night.

48
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,629
I won't go back there.

49
00:06:04,696 --> 00:06:07,472
It took me a month before I could shower in my bathroom.

50
00:06:08,650 --> 00:06:10,456
You know how I got over it ?

51
00:06:11,146 --> 00:06:12,824
I went back to work.

52
00:06:13,185 --> 00:06:15,368
I started living my life again.

53
00:06:15,368 --> 00:06:18,939
I can't just wash away what happened to me in the scrub room, Sean.

54
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:21,163
I'm not like you.

55
00:06:21,558 --> 00:06:23,492
I feel things.

56
00:06:24,857 --> 00:06:26,205
He's out there,

57
00:06:26,205 --> 00:06:29,561
and he's gonna keep terrorizing people until they catch him.

58
00:06:33,442 --> 00:06:35,295
He owns us now.

59
00:06:37,721 --> 00:06:40,049
Remember my eulogy in your nightmare ?

60
00:06:40,549 --> 00:06:44,801
If you believe in jungian analysis, we're every character in dreams.

61
00:06:45,452 --> 00:06:48,050
My voice in your dream is a part of you

62
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:50,253
trying to help yourself through this.

63
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:54,391
I wanted to talk to you at that gravesite, which means

64
00:06:55,530 --> 00:06:59,008
you need to talk to me.

65
00:07:03,249 --> 00:07:05,023
I'm your brother, remember ?

66
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:17,179
He raped me.

67
00:08:52,187 --> 00:08:55,599
You're a very clever boy.

68
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:04,660
Hey, is it too much about me ?

69
00:09:06,283 --> 00:09:08,046
We can change that.

70
00:09:09,106 --> 00:09:10,740
Don't.

71
00:09:12,748 --> 00:09:15,484
Um, what's up ?

72
00:09:16,486 --> 00:09:18,543
I don't know. Maybe

73
00:09:18,543 --> 00:09:21,474
revisiting this relationship wasn't such a good idea.

74
00:09:22,622 --> 00:09:24,994
Why not ?
I don't want anything from you.

75
00:09:24,994 --> 00:09:27,775
We're just having fun.
That's not the point, Julia.

76
00:09:28,265 --> 00:09:30,816
We've been crazy about each other for 2 years now.

77
00:09:30,816 --> 00:09:31,920
It's time to step things up.

78
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,592
We're past the getting to know you phase.

79
00:09:33,592 --> 00:09:36,860
Slow down. You know I've been married for 17 years.

80
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:38,523
You're still married, Julia !

81
00:09:38,523 --> 00:09:40,801
And it's time to make a decision.

82
00:09:40,801 --> 00:09:43,167
Shit or get off the pot.

83
00:09:44,621 --> 00:09:47,350
You know, I preferred you with your fake british accent.

84
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:50,306
At least you sounded more polite.

85
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:40,823
Dr. Troy, this is Detective Kit McGraw of Miami Dade Vice.

86
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:45,538
By now, you're familiar with my voice because this is the fourth message I've left.

87
00:10:45,538 --> 00:10:47,492
You have my number.

88
00:10:47,882 --> 00:10:50,167
Call me back, or face a subpoena.

89
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,009
15 blade.

90
00:12:24,164 --> 00:12:26,312
Christ, it's everywhere.

91
00:12:38,084 --> 00:12:40,012
How could she let this go so long ?

92
00:12:40,012 --> 00:12:42,230
On her patient form, she said she noticed the silicone

93
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:45,144
leaking out of her milk ducts 3 years ago.

94
00:12:45,144 --> 00:12:48,248
I guess she felt that ignoring the problem was the only way to deal with it.

95
00:13:12,351 --> 00:13:14,505
One down. One to go.

96
00:13:14,505 --> 00:13:16,392
Oh, Sean, this took too long.

97
00:13:16,392 --> 00:13:18,706
She's been under for 5 hours already.

98
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,948
I can remove the left implant tomorrow morning.

99
00:13:22,948 --> 00:13:25,286
Mrs. Meyer's Featherlift is at 8:00.

100
00:13:25,286 --> 00:13:28,417
We have already rescheduled her twice.

101
00:13:28,417 --> 00:13:30,404
Christian can take care of Mrs. Meyers.

102
00:13:30,404 --> 00:13:31,916
If he shows up.

103
00:13:32,841 --> 00:13:36,102
- This was a 2-surgeon job, Sean.
-  He'll be here !

104
00:13:36,672 --> 00:13:40,789
I guess sometimes ignoring the problem feels like the only way to deal with it.

105
00:13:53,372 --> 00:13:55,291
I insisted on this music.

106
00:13:56,121 --> 00:13:58,955
I was thinking about you when I directed it.

107
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,896
The reviews have been awesome.

108
00:14:03,756 --> 00:14:08,756
Rollins and Shank gave it 4 cocks up.

109
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:13,239
And one cock down.

110
00:14:15,924 --> 00:14:17,361
I'm sorry.

111
00:14:19,726 --> 00:14:21,654
It's not your movie, Kimber.

112
00:14:21,654 --> 00:14:24,748
Really, I'm very impressed.

113
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:34,400
I'm just... I'm just not available right now.

114
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:36,231
No, you're not.

115
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:46,394
Look, I feel bad about what you went through.
I really do.

116
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:49,450
And I have tried to be patient,

117
00:14:49,450 --> 00:14:53,947
but I can't pretend like I don't miss it, miss you.

118
00:14:55,093 --> 00:14:58,123
I'm tired of masturbating myself to sleep at night.

119
00:14:58,123 --> 00:14:59,349
- I...
- Marry me.

120
00:14:59,349 --> 00:15:01,249
I want a divorce.

121
00:15:01,987 --> 00:15:04,545
It's time, sean, for both of us.

122
00:15:04,545 --> 00:15:05,857
What's the rush ?

123
00:15:07,346 --> 00:15:10,556
We've been separated for almost a year now.

124
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:15,772
Why are you doing this ?

125
00:15:16,188 --> 00:15:17,017
This just seems so...

126
00:15:17,017 --> 00:15:18,628
Totally out of the blue.

127
00:15:19,545 --> 00:15:22,038
It's just not what I expected, you know ?

128
00:15:22,038 --> 00:15:24,763
How can you say you want to get married when

129
00:15:24,763 --> 00:15:28,298
only a moment ago, you said you weren't available ?

130
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:33,798
Maybe I need to open up.

131
00:15:34,223 --> 00:15:35,910
You're the one who's here,

132
00:15:36,339 --> 00:15:38,152
who's always been here.

133
00:15:38,477 --> 00:15:40,351
You're the one I can count on.

134
00:15:40,910 --> 00:15:43,236
- I think we should...
- Just do it.

135
00:15:43,236 --> 00:15:45,910
I don't want to delay the rest of my life.

136
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:47,591
I need to move on.

137
00:15:47,951 --> 00:15:49,765
I need to know that I can.

138
00:15:50,496 --> 00:15:52,268
I thought things were getting better.

139
00:15:52,830 --> 00:15:56,234
Civility isn't necessarily repair.

140
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:59,498
I'm not signing this. No.

141
00:15:59,498 --> 00:16:01,170
- No.
- No ?

142
00:16:02,172 --> 00:16:03,676
That's your response ?

143
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:07,125
You didn't even leave the couch when you asked me.

144
00:16:07,436 --> 00:16:09,728
You didn't even get down on one knee.

145
00:16:18,625 --> 00:16:20,668
Will you marry me ?

146
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:25,351
Do you know how many times I fantasized about hearing you ask me that ?

147
00:16:25,351 --> 00:16:28,013
Good. Then let's set a date and do it.

148
00:16:28,650 --> 00:16:32,117
And what kills me the most is that

149
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:34,827
I didn't even hear the words "I love you."

150
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:39,384
I love you, julia, and I know you love me.

151
00:16:39,384 --> 00:16:42,323
I do love you.

152
00:16:42,323 --> 00:16:45,308
I have loved you since the first day I met you.

153
00:16:45,308 --> 00:16:47,546
Then let's work on this.
Let's not give up.

154
00:16:47,546 --> 00:16:51,523
No. We have been working on this for 17 years.

155
00:16:51,523 --> 00:16:55,729
And we have to face the fact that even though we do love each other,

156
00:16:56,340 --> 00:17:01,076
there is a fundamental piece of this marriage that just doesn't work anymore.

157
00:17:01,778 --> 00:17:05,182
Now please just sign the papers.

158
00:17:23,772 --> 00:17:26,646
- I can't.
- I just can't, Christian.

159
00:17:27,257 --> 00:17:31,413
I can't be that person that you settle for because you're tired and depressed.

160
00:17:32,644 --> 00:17:34,587
I'm not ready to call it a day.

161
00:17:36,809 --> 00:17:39,302
I'm not ready to come die with you.

162
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,358
I'm not giving up on us, Julia.

163
00:17:53,214 --> 00:17:55,227
But I have, Sean.

164
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:30,230
You were sleeping when you were attacked, correct ?

165
00:18:30,230 --> 00:18:31,170
Yes.

166
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:40,319
He drugged you, paralyzed you ?

167
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:41,369
Yes.

168
00:18:41,369 --> 00:18:43,012
And then he cut you ?

169
00:18:44,728 --> 00:18:46,551
You read the report, Detective McGraw.

170
00:18:47,575 --> 00:18:49,261
I've already given my statement.

171
00:18:49,672 --> 00:18:53,228
Not to me, Dr. Troy.

172
00:18:53,948 --> 00:18:56,479
I've just arrived from Jack the ripper's London.

173
00:18:56,479 --> 00:19:00,260
It seems the mayor of Miami doesn't like the plummeting tourist rates

174
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:02,688
that come with a terrorizing maniac on the loose,

175
00:19:02,688 --> 00:19:06,290
so he brought me in to hook the elusive marlin

176
00:19:06,290 --> 00:19:09,104
that the local yahoos can't seem to catch.

177
00:19:09,104 --> 00:19:12,730
So your specialty is sexual predators ?

178
00:19:13,401 --> 00:19:17,000
My specialty is catching them.

179
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:20,881
This is my case now, Dr. Troy.

180
00:19:20,881 --> 00:19:22,864
I would appreciate your cooperation.

181
00:19:22,864 --> 00:19:25,343
I'm more conversationally inclined after a couple of drinks.

182
00:19:25,343 --> 00:19:26,740
I don't drink.

183
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:28,737
I like recovering alcoholics, too.

184
00:19:29,117 --> 00:19:32,392
In my experience, when a person gives up one vice,

185
00:19:32,392 --> 00:19:36,810
they usually overcompensate with others.

186
00:19:36,810 --> 00:19:40,686
And in my experience, Dr. Troy, when a man keeps evading me with bullshit come-ons,

187
00:19:40,686 --> 00:19:44,073
he's either tragically insecure or hung like a toddler.

188
00:19:44,073 --> 00:19:47,750
I assure you, Ms. McGraw, it's neither.

189
00:19:52,048 --> 00:19:54,572
After you were cut, what happened ?

190
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:19,441
- Did he rape you ?
- No.

191
00:20:21,043 --> 00:20:24,244
The first officer on the scene noted in his report that you had wet hair.

192
00:20:24,244 --> 00:20:27,049
You took a shower before the police arrived ?

193
00:20:28,294 --> 00:20:31,183
I cleaned and dressed my own wounds.
I'm a doctor, remember ?

194
00:20:31,183 --> 00:20:34,510
Why would you be so careless and selfish as to wash away fiber evidence

195
00:20:34,510 --> 00:20:37,762
that could stop others from going through the pain you've experienced ?

196
00:20:37,762 --> 00:20:40,909
And why is it, Ms. Mcgraw, that I am the one who's been violated,

197
00:20:40,909 --> 00:20:43,764
and yet you are making me feel like the perpetrator ?

198
00:20:43,764 --> 00:20:46,425
Violated as in slashed or penetrated ?

199
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:48,253
Are we done ?

200
00:20:54,082 --> 00:20:55,306
For now.

201
00:21:21,008 --> 00:21:23,648
Not exactly the welcome back I was expecting.

202
00:21:24,523 --> 00:21:27,584
Maybe because I was expecting you in surgery at 8:00 this morning.

203
00:21:27,584 --> 00:21:30,182
I was being interviewed by a detective. Sorry.

204
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:33,938
You need to ease back in. I get it.

205
00:21:33,938 --> 00:21:35,577
I support it. Whatever you need.

206
00:21:35,577 --> 00:21:37,139
Don't patronize me.

207
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:46,607
Look, I don't know if I'm ready to officially be back yet.

208
00:21:48,541 --> 00:21:51,957
I just wanted to see how it felt first.

209
00:21:52,969 --> 00:21:55,234
You want me to tell you how it feels for me ?

210
00:21:55,639 --> 00:21:57,893
It feels unmanageable now, Christian.

211
00:21:58,413 --> 00:22:00,899
I just had to move 5 appointments to next week,

212
00:22:01,319 --> 00:22:04,529
not to mention the overtime that I'm putting in already.

213
00:22:04,910 --> 00:22:07,840
You may be stuck where you are, but the business isn't.

214
00:22:10,057 --> 00:22:13,199
I'm thinking about calling Quentin Costa,

215
00:22:13,199 --> 00:22:16,806
see if he can come down from Atlanta and pick up some of the slack.

216
00:22:17,506 --> 00:22:19,685
I miss one surgery, and you want to replace me ?

217
00:22:19,685 --> 00:22:21,739
It hasn't been one surgery.

218
00:22:21,739 --> 00:22:26,123
Look, I'm not ready to come back yet.
What's wrong with that ?

219
00:22:27,113 --> 00:22:28,637
You just said, "whatever you need."

220
00:22:28,637 --> 00:22:31,824
I didn't give up 2 decades of my life to build a business

221
00:22:31,824 --> 00:22:35,462
just to turn into some divorced doctor who's stuck with no life,

222
00:22:35,462 --> 00:22:38,949
working 80 hours a week because his partner decides he doesn't want to come in anymore.

223
00:22:38,949 --> 00:22:39,823
Something's gotta change.

224
00:22:39,823 --> 00:22:43,390
If you can't, the business has to.

225
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,319
Divorced ?
When did this happen ?

226
00:22:48,210 --> 00:22:50,594
Oh, Julia just presented me with papers.

227
00:22:52,604 --> 00:22:55,069
But you know what ?
I'm not gonna sign 'em.

228
00:22:55,069 --> 00:22:57,063
She loves me. I love her.

229
00:22:57,063 --> 00:22:58,955
I'm gonna prove to her that we work.

230
00:22:58,955 --> 00:23:02,433
Julia wants to move on with her life.
Why can't you ?

231
00:23:02,433 --> 00:23:04,160
We're not talking about my marriage.

232
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:05,818
This is about my partnership with you.

233
00:23:05,818 --> 00:23:07,215
So what you're saying is it's all about you.

234
00:23:07,215 --> 00:23:09,365
Oh, come on. You weren't the only one who was attacked.

235
00:23:09,365 --> 00:23:11,294
I never would have been attacked if it weren't for you.

236
00:23:11,294 --> 00:23:12,852
Are you blaming me for what happened ?

237
00:23:12,852 --> 00:23:16,073
You're the one who had to do the pro bono work on his other victims.

238
00:23:17,476 --> 00:23:19,094
You're the one who's stuck, Sean.

239
00:23:19,094 --> 00:23:21,028
You haven't dealt with your life at all.

240
00:23:21,728 --> 00:23:25,672
Right now, I may not be able to move in this world, but you won't even look at it.

241
00:23:26,183 --> 00:23:29,714
Sean, Detective Fischman's holding on line one.

242
00:23:29,714 --> 00:23:31,767
He says it's an emergency.

243
00:23:33,489 --> 00:23:34,911
Welcome back.

244
00:23:39,411 --> 00:23:43,029
Congratulations, Sean.
Another carver victim awaits.

245
00:23:43,487 --> 00:23:47,056
And you running out to save the day is just what he wants.

246
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:19,969
Pump some fresh air in here !

247
00:24:19,969 --> 00:24:22,694
And no one inside without a mask and menthol.

248
00:24:31,087 --> 00:24:33,941
- Doctor, thanks for coming out.
- What is going on in there ?

249
00:24:33,941 --> 00:24:35,754
You find another carver victim ?

250
00:24:36,345 --> 00:24:38,501
Worse. Come on.

251
00:24:52,063 --> 00:24:53,813
They could smell her 3 doors down.

252
00:24:53,813 --> 00:24:58,381
We responded to a 911 call about a possible heart attack and found this.

253
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,664
Do you know how it ought to be run ?

254
00:25:11,664 --> 00:25:13,998
With a piece of rubber hose.

255
00:25:14,034 --> 00:25:16,910
Break 'em in two if they talk out of turn.

256
00:25:17,347 --> 00:25:22,068
Anyone who doesn't tow the mark sits in solitary for one month, bread and water.

257
00:25:22,507 --> 00:25:26,396
One funny move from a girl, and I'd clip every hair off of her head.

258
00:25:26,396 --> 00:25:29,704
That's the way it used to be run, and that's the way it ought to be run.

259
00:25:29,704 --> 00:25:33,231
Just like they're a bunch of animals in a cage.

260
00:25:36,118 --> 00:25:38,288
Why didn't you take this woman directly to the hospital ?

261
00:25:38,288 --> 00:25:39,410
We tried moving her.

262
00:25:39,410 --> 00:25:41,278
I had a special wide-body ambulance out front,

263
00:25:41,278 --> 00:25:43,527
but every time we budged her an inch, she started screaming.

264
00:25:43,527 --> 00:25:44,439
Why call me ?

265
00:25:44,439 --> 00:25:46,424
She was screaming holy hell about her skin.

266
00:25:46,424 --> 00:25:48,938
You're the only guy I know in the skin trade.

267
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:57,496
Mrs. Boone, this is Dr. Sean McNamara.
He's here to help you.

268
00:25:58,963 --> 00:26:00,275
Hello, Mrs. Boone.

269
00:26:02,071 --> 00:26:06,264
Anyone ever tell you you look like Damon on guiding light ?

270
00:26:06,695 --> 00:26:08,008
Is that a good thing ?

271
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:16,144
Then thank you, Mrs. Boone.

272
00:26:16,144 --> 00:26:18,945
Call me Momma. Everybody does.

273
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:23,079
How you feeling today, Momma ?

274
00:26:23,079 --> 00:26:24,132
I'm fine.

275
00:26:24,582 --> 00:26:28,441
I told Denny not to call the 911.

276
00:26:28,441 --> 00:26:32,975
He was all worried about my breathing, but I'm all right.

277
00:26:32,975 --> 00:26:35,171
I don't need this.

278
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:43,420
Can you make them stop looking, please ?

279
00:26:43,583 --> 00:26:45,967
Can you guys give us a moment of privacy here ?

280
00:26:46,859 --> 00:26:49,138
- Back off.
- Thanks.

281
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,388
All right.

282
00:26:59,211 --> 00:27:01,123
How long you been like this, Momma ?

283
00:27:01,765 --> 00:27:03,669
Since 2002.

284
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:13,029
You've been on this couch for 3 years ?

285
00:27:13,029 --> 00:27:15,265
It's my sciatica.

286
00:27:15,265 --> 00:27:19,364
Every step I took was like a fire in my back.

287
00:27:19,364 --> 00:27:26,872
The doctor at the hmo said to lie down, and the pain went away, until I got up again.

288
00:27:26,872 --> 00:27:33,278
So I just stayed. I got the tivo so I could see all my stories.

289
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:36,953
Could you lean forward for me for a second ?

290
00:27:37,654 --> 00:27:38,627
No.

291
00:27:41,999 --> 00:27:45,332
There are anti-inflammatory medications you could've taken for your back.

292
00:27:45,649 --> 00:27:48,628
I know there are things I could've done, ok ?

293
00:27:48,628 --> 00:27:51,272
You ain't the first to tell me.

294
00:27:51,272 --> 00:27:57,638
Denny... that's my husband... he tried to get me to go to another doctor a few years back,

295
00:27:57,638 --> 00:27:59,833
but I'd gotten pretty big,

296
00:27:59,833 --> 00:28:04,313
and you know how people get out there when you're big.

297
00:28:07,449 --> 00:28:08,952
What about food ?

298
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:11,989
Denny comes around every weeks or so.

299
00:28:11,989 --> 00:28:17,865
He cashes my disability checks for me, and he brings me whatever I want.

300
00:28:17,865 --> 00:28:22,563
Denny's my lifeline.
He got me the tivo.

301
00:28:23,032 --> 00:28:26,982
What about personal needs, going to the bathroom ?

302
00:28:30,909 --> 00:28:33,704
I'd rather not talk about that.

303
00:28:36,641 --> 00:28:38,284
That's fine.

304
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:42,237
I'm just gonna examine your skin, Momma.

305
00:28:43,548 --> 00:28:45,593
Might hurt a little for a second.

306
00:29:04,364 --> 00:29:07,189
You're doing great.
Just one more second, ok ?

307
00:29:28,807 --> 00:29:30,608
I'm gonna be right back, ok ?

308
00:29:35,681 --> 00:29:37,635
I need to get her to the hospital.

309
00:29:37,635 --> 00:29:41,013
Her exposed skin has grafted itself to the couch.

310
00:29:41,928 --> 00:29:43,031
How is that even possible ?

311
00:29:43,031 --> 00:29:46,175
She's been lying in her own waste in this humid air for 3 years.

312
00:29:46,490 --> 00:29:49,394
Bacteria can live exposed for years on synthetic fibers.

313
00:29:49,394 --> 00:29:52,617
That, coupled with the moisture from her bodily fluids and her extreme weight,

314
00:29:53,107 --> 00:29:56,155
caused her to literally fuse with the fibers in that couch.

315
00:29:56,695 --> 00:29:58,759
The compression of her nerve endings is the only thing keeping her

316
00:29:58,759 --> 00:30:01,199
from passing out from the pain, and we have to move her fast.

317
00:30:01,199 --> 00:30:03,474
What, after 3 years, all of a sudden there's a rush ?

318
00:30:03,474 --> 00:30:06,630
This woman has sepsis and severe deep vein thrombosis.

319
00:30:06,630 --> 00:30:09,722
Any one of a dozen clots in her legs could travel toward her lungs and kill her.

320
00:30:09,722 --> 00:30:10,985
I need to get her legs moving,

321
00:30:10,985 --> 00:30:13,200
and the only way to do that is to get her off that couch.

322
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,112
How ?

323
00:30:14,112 --> 00:30:17,293
There's not a door big enough to get her and the couch through.

324
00:30:23,248 --> 00:30:25,007
Then take this wall out.

325
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,771
- Don't make me go out there.
- Over here.

326
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:07,882
You're gonna be fine.
I'm gonna be right here with you.

327
00:31:07,882 --> 00:31:09,466
I need you to relax.

328
00:31:09,466 --> 00:31:13,646
Are the people out there gonna see me like this ?!

329
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:21,770
Um...listen, do you have some kind of tarp or something ?

330
00:31:21,770 --> 00:31:24,131
Yeah. I think I got something.

331
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:28,009
It's gonna be ok.
We're gonna get you something.

332
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,330
How we doin' ?

333
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:47,637
You guys ready ?

334
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:50,199
All right, let's get her out of here.

335
00:31:50,199 --> 00:31:51,963
Ok, guys, give me the poles over here.

336
00:33:02,642 --> 00:33:03,590
Hello ?

337
00:33:03,590 --> 00:33:06,260
Your 4:00 ass lift is prepped and on the table, Sean.

338
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:07,242
Where are you ?

339
00:33:07,242 --> 00:33:10,941
Oh, shit. I've run into an emergency out in the field.

340
00:33:10,941 --> 00:33:12,645
Um, stall.

341
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:18,005
I am staring at an extremely anxious patient whose bare behind is saying, "how do you do",

342
00:33:18,005 --> 00:33:19,860
to the ceiling, and you want me to stall ?

343
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:23,283
Where's Dr. Sean ?!
Where's Dr. Sean ?!

344
00:33:23,733 --> 00:33:26,519
So page Christian. Have him start.
I'll fly in to finish.

345
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:38,783
No, please. I don't like driving.

346
00:33:38,783 --> 00:33:42,988
I want Denny. Denny always holds my hand in the car.

347
00:33:42,988 --> 00:33:44,351
Where's Denny ?

348
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:52,708
I'll ride with you, Momma, and then your husband can meet us at the hospital, ok ?

349
00:33:52,708 --> 00:33:54,531
- She's stabilized.
- Let's roll.

350
00:33:59,020 --> 00:34:01,438
- It's gonna be ok.
- Thank you.

351
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:23,075
There was traffic. Sorry.

352
00:34:23,075 --> 00:34:26,314
You live 10 minutes from here.
I paged you an hour ago.

353
00:34:26,314 --> 00:34:28,788
Just tell the patient I'll be in in a minute.

354
00:34:28,788 --> 00:34:31,241
The patient left half an hour ago.

355
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:55,684
Dr. Troy. I, uh... I wanted to formally accept.

356
00:34:57,107 --> 00:34:59,391
I'm sorry. Accept what ?

357
00:35:01,492 --> 00:35:04,095
A partnership in McNamara/Troy.

358
00:35:04,095 --> 00:35:05,754
I got Sean's call last week.

359
00:35:05,754 --> 00:35:08,696
He said that the lawyers were drafting the contracts.

360
00:35:09,657 --> 00:35:12,072
This... this is for you.

361
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:20,472
Listen, Quentin, I don't know what sean told you,

362
00:35:20,472 --> 00:35:25,148
but I never agreed to take on someone new, let alone a partner.

363
00:35:27,093 --> 00:35:28,803
Well, this is awkward, isn't it ?

364
00:35:31,808 --> 00:35:35,081
I put my house in Atlanta on the market this morning.

365
00:35:35,081 --> 00:35:37,864
Well, you'll have to take it back off the market. Sorry.

366
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:52,390
It can't be easy to just... bounce back from what you've been through.

367
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,646
Let me take a look at it.

368
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:03,147
Come on, I just bought you a drink, baby.

369
00:36:03,147 --> 00:36:05,299
The least you could do is let me see it.

370
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:21,696
May I ?

371
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:36,123
You really should have this taken care of, Christian, before a wicked keloid pops up.

372
00:36:36,883 --> 00:36:38,006
I'll tell you what.

373
00:36:38,484 --> 00:36:41,859
Sign me up as your partner, and I'll take care of it, gratis.

374
00:36:42,193 --> 00:36:44,337
You think you're a better surgeon than Sean ?

375
00:36:46,249 --> 00:36:50,080
I think I could make both of your lives a lot easier...

376
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:53,186
and bring in some delightful additional income.

377
00:36:53,687 --> 00:36:55,509
Save the hard sell, Quentin.

378
00:36:55,925 --> 00:36:58,960
This is between me and Sean.

379
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:12,444
Thank god. You're quitting. Where's sean ?

380
00:37:12,793 --> 00:37:14,434
Dade county memorial.

381
00:37:14,843 --> 00:37:15,934
Why ?

382
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:21,052
What the hell are you doing ?

383
00:37:21,052 --> 00:37:23,200
Good. I could use an extra pair of hands.

384
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:24,988
Liz, the patient's being prepped in room 2.

385
00:37:24,988 --> 00:37:27,220
- Ok. Will do.
- I'm not helping you.

386
00:37:27,220 --> 00:37:28,552
Then why are you here ?

387
00:37:28,552 --> 00:37:31,164
Quentin Costa paid me a little visit about an hour ago.

388
00:37:31,164 --> 00:37:33,532
He claims that you offered him a partnership.

389
00:37:33,532 --> 00:37:36,111
He's right.
Our lawyer drew up a 6 month contract.

390
00:37:36,111 --> 00:37:37,412
Without consulting me ?

391
00:37:37,412 --> 00:37:40,457
You haven't been available, professionally or personally.

392
00:37:40,457 --> 00:37:43,787
We are not taking on another partner.
End of argument.

393
00:37:43,787 --> 00:37:46,497
You wanna prove to me that we don't need another partner...

394
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:51,467
that you're back in the game ?

395
00:37:51,467 --> 00:37:52,829
Then glove up.

396
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:07,193
And the one under that, please.

397
00:38:08,310 --> 00:38:09,835
A resuscitation form.

398
00:38:09,835 --> 00:38:11,737
In the event you stop breathing during the surgery,

399
00:38:11,737 --> 00:38:13,805
you could require artificial breathing assistance.

400
00:38:13,805 --> 00:38:16,309
You check "yes" if you want that assistance.

401
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:21,627
That's all of it.

402
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:27,250
We're gonna give you a few injections of a local anesthetic

403
00:38:27,250 --> 00:38:29,728
to numb the areas of your skin we need to work on.

404
00:38:29,728 --> 00:38:32,163
You shouldn't feel any pain once the drugs kick in.

405
00:38:32,163 --> 00:38:34,745
Why can't you just put me to sleep ?

406
00:38:34,745 --> 00:38:38,517
Because of your position and sepsis, we can't put you to sleep, Momma.

407
00:38:38,517 --> 00:38:41,091
We can't insert a breathing tube in this position.

408
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:45,617
Haven't I gotten you this far ?

409
00:38:47,828 --> 00:38:48,704
Then relax.

410
00:38:48,704 --> 00:38:51,172
We are gonna take very good care of you.

411
00:38:52,344 --> 00:38:56,600
All right, but be quick.
I don't like needles.

412
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:10,455
You ready ?

413
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:26,661
That's all we can expose her to for now.

414
00:40:26,661 --> 00:40:29,286
Well, we've got at least 20 to go.

415
00:40:29,286 --> 00:40:32,387
An O.D. Of xylocaine can cause a fatal heart arrhythmia.

416
00:40:32,387 --> 00:40:36,507
In her condition, we're pushin' our luck with half of what we've already injected.

417
00:40:36,507 --> 00:40:39,196
We're just gonna have to work on her in pieces, then.

418
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:45,465
Why don't you step... step.

419
00:40:48,436 --> 00:40:50,114
- That's... that's my wife.
- I understand that...

420
00:40:50,114 --> 00:40:52,384
How long till the anesthesia kicks in ?

421
00:40:53,334 --> 00:40:54,927
Enough for half a smoke.

422
00:40:55,983 --> 00:40:58,303
- You can't do this to me.
- Step away from the window here, all right ?

423
00:40:58,303 --> 00:41:01,724
- She's my wife, goddamn it, all right ?
- All right, all right, all right.

424
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:05,058
I'm Dr. Mcnamara.

425
00:41:05,058 --> 00:41:06,830
I'll be performing her surgery.

426
00:41:06,830 --> 00:41:08,018
I'm Denny Boone.

427
00:41:08,018 --> 00:41:10,721
I just wanna see her before you put her under.

428
00:41:11,312 --> 00:41:12,473
Give us a minute ?

429
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:17,518
Mr. Boone, I can't let you see your wife right now.

430
00:41:17,518 --> 00:41:20,779
We've gotta keep her as calm as possible until we've finished the procedure.

431
00:41:20,779 --> 00:41:23,397
Anything that causes a spike in her blood pressure could kill her.

432
00:41:23,397 --> 00:41:25,922
You are telling me that I can't see my own wife

433
00:41:25,922 --> 00:41:28,533
before she undergoes life-threatening surgery ?

434
00:41:28,533 --> 00:41:32,440
I'm telling you that your presence might be more dangerous to her than the surgery itself.

435
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:34,878
Bullshit. I got conjugal rights.

436
00:41:35,559 --> 00:41:39,715
Did those rights extend to keeping her chained to that couch and feeding her like a veal calf ?

437
00:41:39,715 --> 00:41:41,833
You might as well have been pouring gasoline down her throat.

438
00:41:41,833 --> 00:41:43,472
I just gave her what she asked me.

439
00:41:43,472 --> 00:41:46,275
Oh, bullshit. Keeping her in that house let you control her.

440
00:41:46,275 --> 00:41:48,148
If you had loved her at all, you would've gotten her help.

441
00:41:48,148 --> 00:41:50,887
Don't you dare challenge my love for that woman.

442
00:41:50,888 --> 00:41:54,334
She may not look like much to you and your south beach kind, doctor,

443
00:41:54,334 --> 00:41:57,184
but to me she is uma in kill bill.

444
00:41:57,184 --> 00:41:59,747
Now, screw you.
I'm goin' in there.

445
00:42:00,287 --> 00:42:02,360
Don't you hurt me, man.

446
00:42:05,028 --> 00:42:08,062
They should bring you up on charges of criminal negligence.

447
00:42:09,482 --> 00:42:12,753
The only thing you can charge me with is lovin' Momma too much.

448
00:42:12,753 --> 00:42:14,976
And you show it by enabling her sickness ?

449
00:42:14,976 --> 00:42:17,866
You think I didn't want her to lose weight ?

450
00:42:19,606 --> 00:42:23,277
You try gettin' somebody to do something that they don't wanna do.

451
00:42:23,277 --> 00:42:26,557
It's like serving them a sandwich made of shit.

452
00:42:27,249 --> 00:42:32,006
They may eat it, but they ain't gonna like you or it afterwards.

453
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:42,788
What happened to all your good china ?

454
00:42:44,111 --> 00:42:47,587
Uh, they're at home...
uh, I mean, at sean's. Uh...

455
00:42:48,413 --> 00:42:52,277
- there's no room for them here.
- Exactly.

456
00:42:52,667 --> 00:42:57,620
And unless you get a decent settlement, you'll never be able to afford a decent house so you can live with...

457
00:42:57,620 --> 00:42:59,102
China mugs ?

458
00:42:59,753 --> 00:43:02,158
Your china mugs, yes.

459
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:07,143
Mother, you really didn't need to make the trip down here to support me.

460
00:43:07,550 --> 00:43:08,886
I'm a big girl now.

461
00:43:08,886 --> 00:43:11,472
I didn't come down here to hold your hand.

462
00:43:11,472 --> 00:43:14,907
I came to force it. Here.

463
00:43:16,115 --> 00:43:17,377
What are these ?

464
00:43:17,377 --> 00:43:18,667
Worksheets.

465
00:43:19,041 --> 00:43:22,719
I stopped off at Coral's before I came.

466
00:43:22,719 --> 00:43:25,023
God. Coral Langston Stein ?

467
00:43:25,383 --> 00:43:27,633
She's a barracuda.

468
00:43:28,829 --> 00:43:29,940
I know.

469
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:32,038
She makes jaws look like a goldfish,

470
00:43:32,038 --> 00:43:34,813
but she's the best divorce lawyer in Manhattan.

471
00:43:34,813 --> 00:43:36,747
I gave her some of the preliminaries.

472
00:43:36,747 --> 00:43:39,138
Sean didn't assault me.

473
00:43:39,138 --> 00:43:43,661
He threw you against the refrigerator and put his hands around your throat.

474
00:43:43,700 --> 00:43:45,658
Or was he measuring you for a necklace ?

475
00:43:45,658 --> 00:43:49,597
I'd just told him that Matt wasn't his. He reacted.

476
00:43:49,597 --> 00:43:51,259
He certainly did.

477
00:43:51,259 --> 00:43:52,803
Adultery ?

478
00:43:52,803 --> 00:43:56,646
- It's true, isn't it ?
- Ohh. You have no right.

479
00:43:59,937 --> 00:44:03,746
Mother, thank you, but I'll hire my own lawyer.

480
00:44:04,268 --> 00:44:08,106
Fine. Then you pay for it.

481
00:44:08,300 --> 00:44:11,790
I'm sure Sean will be more than happy to loan you the money

482
00:44:11,790 --> 00:44:13,926
so you can take half his practice.

483
00:44:14,456 --> 00:44:19,706
Or do you think those gals with the night school degrees down at women's legal aid can pull that off ?

484
00:44:19,706 --> 00:44:22,190
I don't want half of Sean's practice.

485
00:44:22,190 --> 00:44:24,973
- This isn't what this is about.
- Well, it should be.

486
00:44:25,394 --> 00:44:27,337
You have it coming to you.

487
00:44:27,929 --> 00:44:29,586
Your mcats were higher than his.

488
00:44:29,586 --> 00:44:31,790
You were way ahead of him at school.

489
00:44:31,790 --> 00:44:34,992
Why should he become a rich plastic surgeon while you wind up...

490
00:44:34,992 --> 00:44:36,865
A what ? Tell me, mother.

491
00:44:37,470 --> 00:44:39,254
A total dependent.

492
00:44:41,647 --> 00:44:43,800
It's your turn, Julia.

493
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:46,094
Let him support your dreams this time.

494
00:44:46,094 --> 00:44:50,032
He's the one whose kept you down all these years, preventing you from reaching your potential.

495
00:44:50,552 --> 00:44:52,496
Now he has to pay for that.

496
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,056
She's ready.

497
00:45:06,300 --> 00:45:07,960
You're gonna be ok, Momma.

498
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:13,638
We're gonna start on your legs here, and if you feel anything, you let us know, all right ?

499
00:45:13,638 --> 00:45:19,911
Can you hold my hand, like on the truck ? I'm scared.

500
00:45:19,911 --> 00:45:21,328
I'm sorry. I can't.

501
00:45:21,328 --> 00:45:24,417
I need total mobility to get you off this couch.

502
00:45:25,454 --> 00:45:26,506
Scalpel ?

503
00:45:49,650 --> 00:45:50,877
Pulse irrigator ?

504
00:46:06,943 --> 00:46:08,631
Necrotizing fasciitis ?

505
00:46:08,631 --> 00:46:11,262
Grade 4 to the bone is my guess.

506
00:46:14,028 --> 00:46:15,410
Let's get a culture.

507
00:46:25,300 --> 00:46:26,476
Can you feel that ?

508
00:46:27,700 --> 00:46:31,601
What's this fasitis business you're talking about ?

509
00:46:31,941 --> 00:46:33,382
Is that gangrene ?

510
00:46:33,842 --> 00:46:36,266
Are you gonna have to take my leg off ?

511
00:46:37,167 --> 00:46:39,610
If the infection can't be treated, yes.

512
00:46:40,321 --> 00:46:45,378
But how am I supposed to get off this couch if I can't even walk ?

513
00:46:48,700 --> 00:46:52,280
Momma, would you like to see your husband ?

514
00:46:52,780 --> 00:46:54,423
Denny's here ?

515
00:46:54,763 --> 00:46:57,947
I can bring him in to hold your hand, if that would help you get through this.

516
00:46:58,336 --> 00:47:03,410
No. I don't want him to see me without my face on.

517
00:47:19,995 --> 00:47:21,687
Will I do ?

518
00:47:33,808 --> 00:47:36,582
Go slow, please.

519
00:47:44,115 --> 00:47:45,581
Nice manicure.

520
00:47:47,342 --> 00:47:48,854
I did it myself.

521
00:47:49,104 --> 00:47:52,749
I had to find some way to keep my pride up, you know ?

522
00:47:53,161 --> 00:47:59,220
That was my dream at one point, to be a manicurist in some fancy salon.

523
00:47:59,650 --> 00:48:06,210
My daughter used to say, "Momma, you could get paid for this work, yes, you could."

524
00:48:07,271 --> 00:48:08,432
You have a daughter ?

525
00:48:08,913 --> 00:48:16,546
June. She used to come over once a week, and we'd talk, watch a program or something.

526
00:48:16,546 --> 00:48:20,562
She'd try and clean me up with a little bowl of water and a sponge.

527
00:48:21,863 --> 00:48:26,520
I miss her. I really miss her.

528
00:48:27,772 --> 00:48:29,663
How long has it been since you've seen her ?

529
00:48:30,705 --> 00:48:32,378
Around a year.

530
00:48:33,618 --> 00:48:37,334
June stopped coming 'cause she got so damn mad at me.

531
00:48:37,833 --> 00:48:44,485
Said she couldn't bear seeing me like this anymore, that she couldn't take it,

532
00:48:45,706 --> 00:48:50,233
offering help and support and me not taking it.

533
00:49:03,102 --> 00:49:05,439
Why didn't you try getting off the couch, Momma ?

534
00:49:05,900 --> 00:49:10,578
Well, you know, I'm a neat freak.

535
00:49:11,149 --> 00:49:13,562
I've always run a clean house.

536
00:49:14,022 --> 00:49:18,169
Have you ever tried 409, with the grease cutters ?

537
00:49:18,169 --> 00:49:20,082
It's the best.

538
00:49:21,624 --> 00:49:29,697
Sometimes I'd look around my place, and there was just so much to do.

539
00:49:29,697 --> 00:49:37,270
I'd get to thinking about all the dustin' and scrubbin' the walls down with the 409...

540
00:49:39,822 --> 00:49:42,857
and I'd just feel exhausted.

541
00:49:42,857 --> 00:49:47,466
I got so tired planning all the work that had to be done.

542
00:49:47,466 --> 00:49:51,562
So I'd say to myself, "tomorrow, Momma.

543
00:49:52,712 --> 00:49:58,322
Tomorrow when you get your strength back, it'll be scrub day.

544
00:50:00,213 --> 00:50:05,413
Tomorrow you will get up and do something."

545
00:50:07,306 --> 00:50:12,661
And tomorrow would come, and you'd...still feel exhausted.

546
00:50:14,122 --> 00:50:18,499
Right. That's right.

547
00:50:22,661 --> 00:50:24,860
You're doing great, Momma.
Hang in there.

548
00:50:25,088 --> 00:50:26,729
I can't do it anymore.

549
00:50:26,729 --> 00:50:29,343
Yes, you can. We're half done.

550
00:50:29,343 --> 00:50:32,338
And then what ?
Don't you have to fix the skin ?

551
00:50:32,338 --> 00:50:35,839
When we're done with the surgery, we'll give you a couple of days to

552
00:50:36,091 --> 00:50:41,200
rebuild your strength, and then we'll do some grafting, yes.

553
00:50:45,832 --> 00:50:48,176
Did you get an infection grade on that sample ?

554
00:51:07,500 --> 00:51:10,309
I've done all I can do today.

555
00:51:15,204 --> 00:51:19,620
Liz ?
We'll be right back, Momma.

556
00:51:28,900 --> 00:51:30,551
Well, I say we give her a minute.

557
00:51:30,892 --> 00:51:33,391
I'll keep talking to her, distracting her.

558
00:51:33,391 --> 00:51:36,156
Then we'll start working on the second leg.

559
00:51:36,156 --> 00:51:38,057
Maybe we can save that one.

560
00:51:38,057 --> 00:51:40,327
No. She's losing too much blood.
Look at her pressure.

561
00:51:40,327 --> 00:51:41,685
- I could give her some Dopamine...
- No.

562
00:51:41,685 --> 00:51:45,167
We'll wrap the freed leg today, stabilize her, do the second one tomorrow.

563
00:51:45,167 --> 00:51:48,762
And then we'll do the right tricep on friday and the left on sunday.

564
00:51:48,762 --> 00:51:52,527
She isn't Julia, Sean.
The separation can't go on forever.

565
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:40,573
Her fear of action is worse than the actual pain, Sean.

566
00:52:40,573 --> 00:52:42,061
Let's keep going.

567
00:52:44,500 --> 00:52:46,198
Anita, get me the paddles.

568
00:52:49,213 --> 00:52:51,250
Charge paddles 200 joules.

569
00:52:58,075 --> 00:53:00,960
She signed "no resuscitation" on her form.

570
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:56,621
Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,

571
00:53:56,621 --> 00:54:01,992
I will fear no evil for thou art with me all the day of my life ;

572
00:54:02,513 --> 00:54:06,590
and I will dwell in the house of the lord forever."

573
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:17,959
I'm june. Momma was... my Momma.

574
00:54:20,834 --> 00:54:23,038
I know some of you might think,

575
00:54:24,109 --> 00:54:27,516
"what kind of daughter'd let her own Momma wind up like she done ?"

576
00:54:28,365 --> 00:54:30,601
But it was Momma that made me promise to leave.

577
00:54:34,347 --> 00:54:36,550
I think about you every day, Momma.

578
00:54:37,370 --> 00:54:43,533
You were trapped under the weight of your own fear, and nothing was gonna save you.

579
00:54:45,435 --> 00:54:48,561
All you could do was find it in your heart to free me.

580
00:54:53,011 --> 00:54:54,414
And that you done.

581
00:54:58,500 --> 00:55:00,146
And I thank you for it.

582
00:55:12,035 --> 00:55:13,466
Rest now.

583
00:55:27,300 --> 00:55:30,191
I just wanted to thank you for everything you did for Momma.

584
00:55:30,191 --> 00:55:31,302
I'm sorry.

585
00:55:31,302 --> 00:55:32,835
I wish we could've saved her.

586
00:55:32,835 --> 00:55:35,259
No, I meant paying for the burial.

587
00:55:35,259 --> 00:55:36,380
You're welcome.

588
00:55:36,380 --> 00:55:40,219
I mean the first thing I thought about after they told me that Momma had passed was,

589
00:55:40,219 --> 00:55:43,866
"how the hell am I gonna afford to put her in the ground ?"

590
00:55:43,866 --> 00:55:47,278
They told me I'd need a metal box 'cause she'd fall through the wooden one

591
00:55:47,278 --> 00:55:49,912
and I'd have to pay for 2 cemetery plots.

592
00:55:49,912 --> 00:55:50,724
3.

593
00:55:51,255 --> 00:55:55,814
3. Damn. What's a person with no money supposed to do ?

594
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,034
I mean...you gotta be rich just to die.

595
00:56:32,090 --> 00:56:33,307
Hire Quentin.

596
00:56:35,120 --> 00:56:39,169
I don't know if it's the right move or not, but at least it's a move.

597
00:56:40,800 --> 00:56:43,856
Besides, it'll help me ease back into things.

598
00:56:47,900 --> 00:56:51,065
I'm proud of you for getting off your ass.

599
00:56:51,425 --> 00:56:54,400
- It may only be one leg at a time...
- Now it's your turn.

600
00:56:55,081 --> 00:56:58,400
Both you and Julia deserve a fresh start at happiness.

601
00:56:59,335 --> 00:57:00,919
You need to move on, too.

602
00:57:02,855 --> 00:57:04,378
Just one other thing.

603
00:57:08,462 --> 00:57:10,355
Do you think I could have the couch ?

604
00:57:10,701 --> 00:57:12,799
You want to sit on that piece of shit or keep it as

605
00:57:12,799 --> 00:57:15,193
a memento of how well you took care of her ?

606
00:57:15,193 --> 00:57:22,851
No. I want it 'cause she was part of it, and she's part of me, and I want the couch.

607
00:57:23,762 --> 00:57:28,191
I just... want the couch.

608
00:57:41,155 --> 00:57:44,161
Thanks for finally agreeing to let me look around in here, Christian.

609
00:57:44,601 --> 00:57:46,965
Hey, I've got nothing to hide.

610
00:57:48,270 --> 00:57:50,234
Guess I had a change of heart.

611
00:57:54,063 --> 00:57:57,230
But, um, what are we doing out here ?

612
00:57:58,135 --> 00:58:00,359
He attacked me in the bedroom.

613
00:58:01,800 --> 00:58:06,101
The investigation of crimes is really the investigation of people.

614
00:58:09,214 --> 00:58:14,470
Sometimes the best way to understand an attacker is to get to know his victim.

615
00:58:15,031 --> 00:58:17,058
You can discover everything about a person by seeing

616
00:58:17,058 --> 00:58:19,404
what he chooses to surround himself with.

617
00:58:20,949 --> 00:58:23,599
And what do my surroundings tell you about me ?

618
00:58:23,599 --> 00:58:25,923
That you like to be in control.

619
00:58:27,212 --> 00:58:29,016
Everything is in its place.

620
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:35,735
Compulsively so.

621
00:58:41,400 --> 00:58:42,957
Maid comes once a day.

622
00:58:42,957 --> 00:58:50,514
You're tidy, hard, anal.

623
00:58:52,543 --> 00:58:55,841
The only thing in your home that's soft is your bed,

624
00:58:56,249 --> 00:58:59,722
which I imagine is the only place you feel comfortable being vulnerable,

625
00:58:59,722 --> 00:59:03,559
which makes the fact that he attacked you there all the more difficult to get over.

626
00:59:06,300 --> 00:59:08,108
Tell me about the attack.

627
00:59:08,108 --> 00:59:09,400
Read the file.

628
00:59:09,400 --> 00:59:13,032
Files are for lawyers.
Bullshit carpet fiber information.

629
00:59:13,032 --> 00:59:15,478
How many feet from the door to the bed.

630
00:59:15,782 --> 00:59:17,256
Black-and-white stuff.

631
00:59:18,040 --> 00:59:19,844
I need you to give me the color.

632
00:59:21,606 --> 00:59:27,278
You first. Tell me your secrets, and I'll tell you mine.

633
00:59:27,278 --> 00:59:29,842
There's nothing I haven't seen, Christian.

634
00:59:33,600 --> 00:59:34,998
I don't judge.

635
00:59:40,300 --> 00:59:42,028
You can talk to me.

636
00:59:42,784 --> 00:59:43,706
Bullshit.

637
00:59:46,227 --> 00:59:50,067
I want the one that did to you what the carver did to me.

638
00:59:52,300 --> 00:59:56,708
You want my pain ?
Let me see yours.

639
01:00:07,500 --> 01:00:09,507
I was 24.

640
01:00:11,590 --> 01:00:14,840
We were married 6 months to the day.
His name was jason.

641
01:00:17,100 --> 01:00:18,617
Did he hurt you ?

642
01:00:19,157 --> 01:00:23,224
No. Jason was a good man.

643
01:00:25,636 --> 01:00:30,504
He stopped on his way home from work to pick us up a bottle of champagne for our half anniversary.

644
01:00:31,300 --> 01:00:33,969
When he got back to the car, someone pulled a gun.

645
01:00:36,502 --> 01:00:38,164
The guy didn't have to shoot him.

646
01:00:38,164 --> 01:00:41,096
The car was a piece of shit '78 volvo.

647
01:00:41,900 --> 01:00:45,138
Jason would've handed him the key and considered it a favor.

648
01:00:48,467 --> 01:00:51,511
I was at law school, but dropped out and signed up

649
01:00:51,511 --> 01:00:55,157
for law enforcement with an eagle eye on vice.

650
01:00:59,052 --> 01:01:01,891
I guess I thought that if I could spend my time working in the darkness,

651
01:01:01,891 --> 01:01:05,016
what happened to me would by comparison seem a little more light.

652
01:01:08,942 --> 01:01:13,279
The real kick in the ass was that I already had a bottle of dom chilling that night.

653
01:01:15,941 --> 01:01:17,894
Gift of the magi, right ?

654
01:01:19,431 --> 01:01:20,733
I'm really sorry.

655
01:01:22,635 --> 01:01:25,129
Trust me enough to show me your bedroom now ?

656
01:01:35,055 --> 01:01:36,336
Lie down. 

657
01:01:38,766 --> 01:01:40,547
I want to reenact the attack.

658
01:01:43,400 --> 01:01:46,704
I just told you about the worst night of my life. Now it's your turn.

659
01:02:08,300 --> 01:02:13,524
First he injected you, paralyzed you.

660
01:02:15,920 --> 01:02:19,229
At this point, you're helpless.
He could do whatever he wanted with you.

661
01:02:22,393 --> 01:02:24,384
Then came the slashing, right ?

662
01:02:51,941 --> 01:02:55,977
Judging by the angle of the wound, I guess he was right on top of you.

663
01:02:57,259 --> 01:02:59,817
Leverage-wise, he'd have wanted to straddle you.

664
01:03:08,419 --> 01:03:10,242
That's not what happened...

665
01:03:14,150 --> 01:03:16,098
You were paralyzed, remember ?

666
01:03:19,778 --> 01:03:21,517
Were you wearing a shirt ?

667
01:03:23,764 --> 01:03:26,158
It must've been awful for you.

668
01:03:27,670 --> 01:03:31,892
A man who needs to be in charge demoted to another person's plaything.

669
01:03:32,717 --> 01:03:37,529
I can't imagine the carver having a chance like this and not taking advantage of it.

670
01:03:37,879 --> 01:03:39,762
I guess I wasn't his type.

671
01:03:44,900 --> 01:03:47,459
Something's telling me that I'm yours, though.

672
01:03:58,849 --> 01:04:00,701
Do you seduce all your victims ?

673
01:04:00,701 --> 01:04:03,938
Only the ones who are as dark as I am.

674
01:04:15,500 --> 01:04:16,797
Now what do we do ?

675
01:04:20,146 --> 01:04:22,289
Fight through the pain.

676
01:05:04,700 --> 01:05:05,947
Guess I'm early.

677
01:05:08,560 --> 01:05:09,932
Maybe I should go.

678
01:05:10,248 --> 01:05:11,188
No.

679
01:05:11,555 --> 01:05:13,504
First you propose to me.

680
01:05:14,484 --> 01:05:19,079
Now you're screwing another girl. Who are you ?

681
01:05:21,442 --> 01:05:23,095
I'm me again, baby.

682
01:05:23,656 --> 01:05:25,138
I'm back.

683
01:07:04,135 --> 01:07:06,669
Come in.
Aren't you a little early ?

684
01:07:06,669 --> 01:07:08,465
Annie's still packing her weekend bag.

685
01:07:08,465 --> 01:07:10,498
Well, I was hoping we could talk.

686
01:07:10,842 --> 01:07:12,755
Oh, it's not really necessary, Julia.

687
01:07:12,755 --> 01:07:13,950
- Well, no, Sean...
- Look,

688
01:07:13,950 --> 01:07:16,784
I'm sorry I've been so resistant about signing these.

689
01:07:16,784 --> 01:07:19,685
But that's what I wanted to talk about.
I felt that...

690
01:07:19,685 --> 01:07:21,835
No need. You were right, Julia.

691
01:07:21,835 --> 01:07:27,909
It's me who's been stuck in old patterns of thinking, old ways of seeing you and us.

692
01:07:29,259 --> 01:07:30,983
You've done the hard thing.

693
01:07:31,523 --> 01:07:32,805
You've faced the truth.

694
01:07:35,261 --> 01:07:39,441
Well, I'm not sure I know what the truth is anymore.

695
01:07:42,233 --> 01:07:45,694
The truth is, Julia, you deserve to fly.

696
01:07:45,694 --> 01:07:48,442
You deserve to live the life you've dreamed of.

697
01:07:49,128 --> 01:07:50,409
We both do.

698
01:07:52,111 --> 01:07:54,616
And we've tried, and we've tried, and...

699
01:07:55,748 --> 01:07:58,458
we can't make each other happy, can we ?

700
01:08:03,280 --> 01:08:04,483
No.

701
01:08:09,473 --> 01:08:12,979
Are you saying you want to go ahead with the divorce ?

702
01:08:13,691 --> 01:08:17,326
I do. I've signed them.

703
01:08:27,698 --> 01:08:29,770
- Thanks.
- Hi, mom.

704
01:08:30,077 --> 01:08:35,008
Hey ! Hi, sweetie.

705
01:08:36,600 --> 01:08:38,479
You have fun with your mom.

706
01:08:39,489 --> 01:08:41,307
I'll see you, Jules.

707
01:08:59,879 --> 01:09:01,583
Are you ready to go ?

708
01:09:04,700 --> 01:09:09,425
No, honey. I don't think I am.
