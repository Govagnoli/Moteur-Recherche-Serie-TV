1
00:00:04,781 --> 00:00:07,016
I brought you some cucumber water.

2
00:00:07,339 --> 00:00:08,372
Thank you.

3
00:00:09,456 --> 00:00:14,038
Alana is the top swedish massage therapist in all of Miami.

4
00:00:15,395 --> 00:00:22,937
And... and we also do aromatherapy, thai, shiatsu, and hot stone massage.

5
00:00:23,029 --> 00:00:27,913
And... we just received a 4-star review in Spalife Magazine.

6
00:00:28,268 --> 00:00:29,255
Really?

7
00:00:31,197 --> 00:00:36,264
Imagine--an entire magazine devoted to spas.

8
00:00:36,347 --> 00:00:40,521
Well, it's not just spas. It's, um, you know, skin care, beauty treatments--

9
00:00:40,612 --> 00:00:45,968
Alana, dear, out of over 600 muscles in the human body, so far you've only done one.

10
00:00:46,957 --> 00:00:49,971
Um, just excuse us a minute, please.

11
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:56,062
She may be the best in Miami.

12
00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:59,033
In New York she'd be lucky to work at the Y.

13
00:00:59,133 --> 00:01:03,227
Mother, you see those hot tubs? Go soak yourself.

14
00:01:03,619 --> 00:01:07,825
Sweetheart, I'm thrilled you've found something that gratifies you.

15
00:01:07,832 --> 00:01:08,935
It's unbelievable.

16
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:12,967
You've managed to turn annihilating me into an art form.

17
00:01:13,369 --> 00:01:15,807
If you'd let me get you the settlement you deserved,

18
00:01:15,895 --> 00:01:18,667
you'd be halfway through your second year at med school.

19
00:01:18,764 --> 00:01:21,263
Before long you'd have had your own practice.

20
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:23,225
And bought a spa.

21
00:01:23,432 --> 00:01:26,633
And hired some other desperate divorcee to run it.

22
00:01:26,727 --> 00:01:28,272
What time did you say your plane was?

23
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:32,100
7:00. I moved it from 4:00 so we'd have time to spend together.

24
00:01:32,194 --> 00:01:34,490
Well, I think you should get the earlier flight.

25
00:01:34,586 --> 00:01:37,142
Darling, be proud of your spa.

26
00:01:37,252 --> 00:01:40,295
Stop looking to me for approval. You shouldn't need it anymore.

27
00:01:40,385 --> 00:01:41,855
I don't need it!

28
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:46,369
It's just that it would be nice to know what it feels like before either of us dies!

29
00:01:46,942 --> 00:01:48,131
Ok.

30
00:01:49,906 --> 00:01:55,075
There are specialists who deal in separation/individuation issues.

31
00:01:55,164 --> 00:01:57,374
- If you're interested--
- Ok, just get out!

32
00:01:57,463 --> 00:02:04,504
Get out and get your cold, judgmental, Michael Kors wearing ass out of my spa now! Ok?

33
00:02:04,584 --> 00:02:06,426
Just take the earlier flight!

34
00:02:06,519 --> 00:02:11,881
Erikson defines love as that which promotes another's growth.

35
00:02:11,966 --> 00:02:15,785
Oh, you want to see me grow, mother? Get the hell out of my life!

36
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,904
Thar she blows.

37
00:03:26,053 --> 00:03:29,502
Mrs. Winant is waiting. I'm not sure what I should tell her.

38
00:03:29,629 --> 00:03:32,809
Tell her that Dr. Costa was an hour and a half late.

39
00:03:33,081 --> 00:03:35,698
Give her another valium and tell her to relax.

40
00:03:37,375 --> 00:03:39,686
She's already had 20 milligrams.

41
00:03:39,818 --> 00:03:42,729
You sure you want to give her any more before she goes under?

42
00:03:43,142 --> 00:03:44,555
Would you like to finish for me?

43
00:03:44,659 --> 00:03:45,567
What?

44
00:03:45,683 --> 00:03:47,505
Well, I guess while I was oversleeping, someone went out

45
00:03:47,578 --> 00:03:49,878
and got themselves a license to practice medicine.

46
00:03:50,095 --> 00:03:52,141
Look, I didn't mean to interfere. I--

47
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:54,615
Honey, unless you have an M.D. after your name,

48
00:03:54,704 --> 00:03:58,174
stick to your facials and fluffy pillows and leave the medical procedures to me.

49
00:03:58,265 --> 00:03:59,894
Don't call me honey, Quentin.

50
00:04:00,002 --> 00:04:01,744
I happen to be your boss.

51
00:04:03,063 --> 00:04:04,734
Oh, I've been a bad boy.

52
00:04:05,293 --> 00:04:07,670
You gonna fire me or paddle my booty?

53
00:04:08,674 --> 00:04:11,410
I'll tell her you'll be with her as soon as you can.

54
00:04:12,546 --> 00:04:13,575
Thanks...

55
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:15,750
boss.

56
00:04:19,239 --> 00:04:20,162
Wow.

57
00:04:20,697 --> 00:04:23,982
And I thought this was the largest ass I'd ever seen.

58
00:05:20,681 --> 00:05:23,313
Excuse me, I'm looking for information on flight 237.

59
00:05:23,391 --> 00:05:24,750
My mother was on that plane.

60
00:05:24,847 --> 00:05:27,264
I'm sorry, there's no information at present. If you'd like to--

61
00:05:27,349 --> 00:05:29,672
What about survivors? Are there any survivors?

62
00:05:29,757 --> 00:05:33,689
Ma'am, we're asking all family members to gather at the hotel lobby right across the street.

63
00:05:33,774 --> 00:05:36,284
If you'd like transportation, there's a shuttle leaving right now.

64
00:05:52,697 --> 00:05:53,979
May I have your attention?

65
00:05:54,129 --> 00:05:57,165
Flight 237 ran into difficulties on takeoff,

66
00:05:57,265 --> 00:06:00,772
hitting the roof of a house, then crashing into a nearby street.

67
00:06:01,059 --> 00:06:04,258
The aircraft's body was divided into two parts.

68
00:06:04,365 --> 00:06:08,572
Now, the word from the crash site is that there are some survivors.

69
00:06:08,694 --> 00:06:10,247
Thank god. Who are they?

70
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:12,787
We are not releasing those names yet.

71
00:06:12,894 --> 00:06:17,304
But in the interim, please fill out the yellow identification forms

72
00:06:17,406 --> 00:06:19,036
and return them to the podium.

73
00:06:48,899 --> 00:06:49,749
Thanks.

74
00:06:50,497 --> 00:06:52,428
I've gone through 2 packs already.

75
00:06:57,173 --> 00:06:58,320
Natalie Holden.

76
00:06:59,676 --> 00:07:01,428
My mother's on that flight.

77
00:07:01,894 --> 00:07:03,326
Julia McNamara.

78
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:05,100
Mine is, too.

79
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:10,495
We flew her out here business class.

80
00:07:11,327 --> 00:07:13,840
She was going to New York to see her sister.

81
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:16,769
They just had to see a broadway show.

82
00:07:18,712 --> 00:07:19,723
I'm sorry.

83
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:22,584
I'm running my mouth. I do that when I'm nervous.

84
00:07:23,208 --> 00:07:26,729
No, please, it helps hearing you talk.

85
00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:34,154
Jewelry, watches. Are they kidding?

86
00:07:34,294 --> 00:07:36,995
I can't even remember what earrings I have on.

87
00:07:37,332 --> 00:07:38,965
Well, what about a wedding ring?

88
00:07:39,066 --> 00:07:42,077
Oh, please. She wouldn't be seen dead wearing...

89
00:07:45,046 --> 00:07:51,247
Mine never went anywhere without her silver cross and her 2004 world series necklace.

90
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:53,886
Your mom's a baseball fan?

91
00:07:54,005 --> 00:07:58,969
Nah. She's just an ex-catholic who believes god speaks to us through the Red Sox.

92
00:08:00,191 --> 00:08:02,837
Well, what's god trying to say?

93
00:08:04,074 --> 00:08:05,450
Miracles happen.

94
00:08:06,333 --> 00:08:10,270
Believe in someone enough and they'll surprise you.

95
00:08:14,858 --> 00:08:15,903
Blood type.

96
00:08:16,861 --> 00:08:18,613
I used to know that.

97
00:08:19,995 --> 00:08:21,581
Ma's O-negative.

98
00:08:22,601 --> 00:08:25,888
She said the best part about being a universal donor was that

99
00:08:25,977 --> 00:08:30,065
she could never be so broke that she couldn't give something to the needy.

100
00:08:30,202 --> 00:08:32,691
She sounds like a special person.

101
00:08:32,735 --> 00:08:33,656
Yeah. 

102
00:08:34,805 --> 00:08:37,356
She  stood by me when no one else would.

103
00:08:38,078 --> 00:08:42,812
I'd look into her eyes and see myself as she saw me...

104
00:08:43,282 --> 00:08:45,860
smart, successful.

105
00:08:46,068 --> 00:08:47,374
Beautiful.

106
00:08:48,725 --> 00:08:52,423
If someone does that long enough you begin to believe them.

107
00:08:54,764 --> 00:08:57,558
Um... yeah, well, I just, uh...

108
00:08:57,699 --> 00:09:01,263
No,  I mean... my mother and I, we...

109
00:09:01,899 --> 00:09:03,762
It doesn't matter.

110
00:09:04,733 --> 00:09:06,527
She knows you love her.

111
00:09:07,055 --> 00:09:08,140
Yeah.

112
00:09:09,608 --> 00:09:12,516
Uh, I better finish this.

113
00:09:14,226 --> 00:09:17,753
Wait here. I'm gonna go get us a fresh pack of tissues.

114
00:09:25,972 --> 00:09:28,082
WCNU breaking news.

115
00:09:28,159 --> 00:09:33,987
Viceroy Airlines, flight 237 had engine trouble on takeoff and has crashed.

116
00:09:34,074 --> 00:09:37,755
We have early reports of survivors but no names have been released.

117
00:09:37,801 --> 00:09:40,333
Due to fire and debris causing road closures,

118
00:09:40,411 --> 00:09:44,993
a triage center has been set up at dakota high school, 2 blocks from the site of the crash

119
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:47,403
- to avoid potentially fatal transport delays.
- Hi. It's me.

120
00:09:47,485 --> 00:09:51,713
God, I wish you were there. Something awful's happened.

121
00:09:58,328 --> 00:10:00,758
Julia? I'm here. What's wrong?

122
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:22,183
The chances for survival are no worse at a triage center than at an E.R.

123
00:10:22,262 --> 00:10:26,108
These are professionals, specially trained in dealing with crisis situations.

124
00:10:26,217 --> 00:10:27,845
Now, you sure you want to look for your mother?

125
00:10:27,923 --> 00:10:30,574
You might find something you wish you hadn't. I can call you.

126
00:10:30,652 --> 00:10:34,127
No. I can deal with what I know much better than what I don't.

127
00:10:34,209 --> 00:10:37,594
Besides, there's a chance that I may still be able to find her.

128
00:10:37,704 --> 00:10:40,094
It's a small chance, Jules. You know that.

129
00:10:40,185 --> 00:10:43,151
She wasn't supposed to leave until 7:00. We had a fight.

130
00:10:43,238 --> 00:10:46,308
I told her to get an earlier plane and get the hell out of my life.

131
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:49,172
Those can't be the last words I ever say to her.

132
00:10:52,577 --> 00:10:54,084
Thank you for coming.

133
00:10:54,604 --> 00:10:58,217
It says something, doesn't it, that you were the only one I thought to call?

134
00:10:58,314 --> 00:10:59,494
I'm glad you did.

135
00:11:04,351 --> 00:11:06,062
Sorry, emergency personnel only.

136
00:11:06,153 --> 00:11:09,619
Dr. Sean McNamara. It got a call saying you could use some help.

137
00:11:09,733 --> 00:11:11,281
I don't have you on the list.

138
00:11:11,387 --> 00:11:13,183
- What's the problem?
- I don't have him on the list.

139
00:11:13,267 --> 00:11:16,715
Who gives a shit? We need doctors. Check his license and send him in.

140
00:11:17,596 --> 00:11:19,167
Ok. Go. Go.

141
00:11:19,633 --> 00:11:22,477
Dr. McNamara of McNamara and Troy. I'm a plastic surgeon.

142
00:11:22,582 --> 00:11:24,926
Good. We can sure as hell use one in there. It's a barbecue.

143
00:11:25,024 --> 00:11:26,601
Dr. Russell Marcus. 

144
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:29,202
I'm sorry, authorized medical personnel only.

145
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:30,233
She's my assistant.

146
00:11:30,333 --> 00:11:31,297
Are you an R.N.?

147
00:11:31,429 --> 00:11:32,933
I had a year of premed.

148
00:11:33,056 --> 00:11:34,078
Wait outside, please.

149
00:11:34,176 --> 00:11:36,053
My mother was on that plane.

150
00:11:38,448 --> 00:11:39,668
I'm sorry.

151
00:11:41,749 --> 00:11:44,407
He's right, Julia. It's crazy to think you can handle this.

152
00:11:44,499 --> 00:11:46,465
Take the car keys, go back to the hotel.

153
00:11:46,523 --> 00:11:49,952
Don't tell me what I can handle, Sean, please. Not now.

154
00:11:51,526 --> 00:11:52,726
You coming, doctor?

155
00:11:56,952 --> 00:11:58,238
Not without her.

156
00:12:01,605 --> 00:12:02,648
Follow me.

157
00:12:03,499 --> 00:12:05,352
We divided the gymnasium into 4 areas.

158
00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:08,735
Red tags need immediate attention--severe bleeding, shock, open wounds.

159
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:10,967
Yellow--serious but not immediately life-threatening--

160
00:12:11,042 --> 00:12:12,948
burns but no respiratory distress, spinal injuries.

161
00:12:13,042 --> 00:12:15,668
Greens can wait--cuts, bruises, contusions.

162
00:12:15,754 --> 00:12:17,682
Don't worry about the ones in the black area. They're not going to make it.

163
00:12:17,767 --> 00:12:19,269
Palliative measures only.

164
00:12:19,931 --> 00:12:21,531
Maybe you can hold some hands.

165
00:12:59,057 --> 00:13:01,800
Come on, doctor. Masks and gloves are on the table. Let's go!

166
00:13:27,023 --> 00:13:28,036
Stop!

167
00:13:30,058 --> 00:13:31,516
I think that's my mother.

168
00:13:34,117 --> 00:13:35,752
No. It's not her.

169
00:13:37,707 --> 00:13:40,439
Please, help me.

170
00:13:40,611 --> 00:13:41,867
I'm so cold.

171
00:13:47,546 --> 00:13:48,991
I'm so cold.

172
00:13:49,465 --> 00:13:51,386
I'll get you a blanket.

173
00:13:55,543 --> 00:13:56,723
My baby...

174
00:13:57,769 --> 00:13:59,688
I don't feel her kicking.

175
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:02,348
How far along are you?

176
00:14:02,978 --> 00:14:04,480
7 months.

177
00:14:05,221 --> 00:14:06,543
Please...

178
00:14:07,276 --> 00:14:09,147
is my baby ok?

179
00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:17,768
There.

180
00:14:18,834 --> 00:14:20,416
Can you feel that?

181
00:14:23,446 --> 00:14:25,415
It's happening again.

182
00:14:26,199 --> 00:14:27,373
Yes.

183
00:14:28,953 --> 00:14:30,683
I felt it that time.

184
00:14:32,666 --> 00:14:34,375
Do you know how to replace an I.V. bag?

185
00:14:34,476 --> 00:14:36,000
- I think so.
- Good. Come with me.

186
00:14:41,326 --> 00:14:42,792
Her face is the least of it.

187
00:14:42,890 --> 00:14:44,374
She's in D.I.C.

188
00:14:44,534 --> 00:14:48,420
That's where the blood clots throughout the body but not at the initial injury site.

189
00:14:48,514 --> 00:14:51,685
So the body responds by triggering clot-dissolving mechanisms

190
00:14:51,770 --> 00:14:53,476
which cause the patient to bleed to death.

191
00:14:53,577 --> 00:14:55,347
I'm sorry, doctor. I didn't realize that you--

192
00:14:55,430 --> 00:14:57,675
I'm not... a doctor.

193
00:14:58,199 --> 00:15:01,123
So all you can do is force fluids and keep her comfortable?

194
00:15:01,444 --> 00:15:02,586
Exactly.

195
00:15:02,728 --> 00:15:03,597
Thank you.

196
00:15:11,773 --> 00:15:13,852
Got any olive oil?

197
00:15:14,535 --> 00:15:16,790
To  prevent scarring.

198
00:15:19,253 --> 00:15:21,545
My grandmother used it all the time.

199
00:15:23,296 --> 00:15:25,558
Would antiseptic cream do?

200
00:15:30,242 --> 00:15:32,956
Rub some on my face, will you, honey?

201
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:34,739
It hurts like hell.

202
00:15:35,832 --> 00:15:38,964
Fractured my pelvis. Did they tell you?

203
00:15:39,544 --> 00:15:41,274
Fractured  pelvis.

204
00:15:41,403 --> 00:15:46,874
I mean, I'm 68. I was bound to break a hip one of these days.

205
00:15:47,764 --> 00:15:52,288
You're supposed to say, "you don't look 68."

206
00:15:54,137 --> 00:15:55,725
Relax, honey.

207
00:15:55,832 --> 00:15:59,716
It's just a little antiseptic cream, not surgery.

208
00:16:00,549 --> 00:16:02,300
That's lucky for you.

209
00:16:06,453 --> 00:16:07,521
Listen.

210
00:16:08,366 --> 00:16:09,934
Do you have a mirror?

211
00:16:10,925 --> 00:16:13,787
I left my purse in the car.

212
00:16:15,319 --> 00:16:18,641
Everybody's out of mirrors today.

213
00:16:20,242 --> 00:16:23,843
How come no one will let me see my face?

214
00:16:24,497 --> 00:16:28,911
I mean... I was no Angie Dickinson to start with.

215
00:16:29,025 --> 00:16:32,324
They're just a little backed up. That's all.

216
00:16:32,711 --> 00:16:34,057
Of course.

217
00:16:34,441 --> 00:16:37,275
Vanity, thy name is Helen.

218
00:16:37,892 --> 00:16:40,358
Shame on me.

219
00:16:40,924 --> 00:16:42,350
I survived.

220
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:45,971
I should be on my knees thanking god.

221
00:16:48,253 --> 00:16:53,044
Well, Helen, why don't we work our way from the neck up?

222
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:12,524
Kill me, please.

223
00:17:12,558 --> 00:17:13,990
It's important that you try not to move.

224
00:17:14,088 --> 00:17:16,500
- I'm begging you, please.
- Hey, hey, hey, calm down! Calm down!

225
00:17:16,571 --> 00:17:18,924
Can I get some phenobarbital, something to calm this guy down?

226
00:17:19,013 --> 00:17:20,750
I have a xanax in my purse.

227
00:17:20,847 --> 00:17:22,997
Save it. I'll split it with you later.

228
00:17:23,111 --> 00:17:25,526
This kid was reaching out to me...

229
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:29,739
but the fire was a foot away from the fuel tanks.

230
00:17:29,921 --> 00:17:31,136
I ran.

231
00:17:34,041 --> 00:17:35,747
I left him there.

232
00:17:36,679 --> 00:17:38,299
I--I watched him burn.

233
00:17:40,267 --> 00:17:43,167
He couldn't have been more than 8 or 9 years old.

234
00:17:43,756 --> 00:17:45,856
I let him sit in the cockpit...

235
00:17:46,004 --> 00:17:47,802
gave him a set of wings.

236
00:17:51,772 --> 00:17:53,317
You're the pilot.

237
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:57,867
I don't know who I am anymore.

238
00:18:00,621 --> 00:18:03,711
All I know is I'm not the man I thought I was.

239
00:18:07,053 --> 00:18:08,176
Dr. McNamara, I need you.

240
00:18:08,283 --> 00:18:10,455
- I'm not through here.
- Let the nurse finish.

241
00:18:14,179 --> 00:18:16,761
We got real trouble. 180-degree gashes around the mid-biceps.

242
00:18:16,842 --> 00:18:18,088
Both arms need to be amputated.

243
00:18:18,172 --> 00:18:20,308
In triage? That's crazy. Wait till he gets to an E.R.

244
00:18:20,396 --> 00:18:22,699
He's hypotensive. The blood vessels are ripped open. The arms are unstable.

245
00:18:22,786 --> 00:18:24,355
Every time we move them more vessels rip.

246
00:18:24,439 --> 00:18:25,816
He's already lost too much blood.

247
00:18:25,904 --> 00:18:29,085
Why not put a vacuum splint and keep him on dextran till he's transported?

248
00:18:29,168 --> 00:18:30,882
No time. He's going into shock.

249
00:18:32,534 --> 00:18:34,720
That's the other thing-- he's a type 2 diabetic.

250
00:18:35,214 --> 00:18:37,031
He lost both legs already before this.

251
00:18:37,118 --> 00:18:39,386
The tourniquets aren't holding. He's lost 2 liters of blood.

252
00:18:39,470 --> 00:18:40,758
You sure you're up to this?

253
00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:42,720
Let's get started.

254
00:18:43,949 --> 00:18:46,955
Hey, buddy. You ok?

255
00:18:47,198 --> 00:18:49,070
You don't look so good.

256
00:18:57,109 --> 00:18:58,783
Is something wrong?

257
00:18:59,410 --> 00:19:04,842
No. My hands just, uh, shake when I've drunk too much coffee.

258
00:19:06,567 --> 00:19:08,268
What's your name, honey?

259
00:19:09,125 --> 00:19:10,297
Julia.

260
00:19:11,271 --> 00:19:14,435
Beautiful name for a beautiful girl.

261
00:19:16,872 --> 00:19:19,447
I have a daughter about your age.

262
00:19:20,241 --> 00:19:23,288
Yeah. I met her.

263
00:19:23,476 --> 00:19:24,536
N atalie.

264
00:19:24,837 --> 00:19:25,908
Is she here?

265
00:19:26,015 --> 00:19:31,109
No. Uh, I talked to her at the hotel across from the airport.

266
00:19:31,213 --> 00:19:32,895
Does she know I'm all right?

267
00:19:34,071 --> 00:19:39,497
I'm sure if they haven't released the names of the survivors, they will soon.

268
00:19:42,152 --> 00:19:44,281
How did you know it was me?

269
00:19:45,790 --> 00:19:49,594
She told me you're a Red Sox fan.

270
00:20:05,943 --> 00:20:08,356
Julia... honey.

271
00:20:08,521 --> 00:20:10,155
Now, be a good girl.

272
00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:11,887
Level with me.

273
00:20:12,562 --> 00:20:15,048
It's not just my pelvis, is it?

274
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:24,963
It's ok, honey.

275
00:20:30,557 --> 00:20:34,482
Tell Natalie--you know, if I don't get to see her...

276
00:20:35,203 --> 00:20:37,184
that I want to be cremated.

277
00:20:37,251 --> 00:20:40,717
Hey. Is that any way for a Sox fan to talk?

278
00:20:40,844 --> 00:20:44,179
You tell her I had a great life

279
00:20:44,321 --> 00:20:48,030
and that she was the best part of it.

280
00:20:48,998 --> 00:20:58,543
Tell her not to forget that she is something rare and precious, ok?

281
00:21:00,110 --> 00:21:04,858
And that no mother ever loved a daughter more.

282
00:21:07,007 --> 00:21:08,869
Can you remember that?

283
00:21:10,031 --> 00:21:12,583
For the rest of my life.

284
00:21:27,257 --> 00:21:30,161
Hurry it up, ok, buddy? I got a plane to catch.

285
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:32,031
I'm singing at my son's wedding.

286
00:21:32,142 --> 00:21:33,780
Try not to move, Mr. Perri.

287
00:21:33,884 --> 00:21:36,849
I gotta talk to the band leader, give him the music.

288
00:21:36,958 --> 00:21:40,851
Mr. Perri, I'm gonna have to amputate both your arms before you lose any more blood.

289
00:21:40,948 --> 00:21:44,386
Now, once you've been moved to an E.R., we'll do everything we can to reattach them.

290
00:21:44,414 --> 00:21:45,799
Do you understand me?

291
00:21:46,093 --> 00:21:47,128
You need a hand?

292
00:21:47,226 --> 00:21:49,603
Oh, thank god. I was afraid you wouldn't get my message.

293
00:21:49,693 --> 00:21:54,346
Hey, beautiful! How you doin'? You want to see my arms come on and off?

294
00:21:54,446 --> 00:21:57,424
Let's see what kind of cocktail that last bartender made for you, ok?

295
00:21:57,512 --> 00:21:58,623
Any update on Erica?

296
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:00,001
No, not yet.

297
00:22:00,266 --> 00:22:03,195
Dr. Marcus, my associate Dr. Troy's arrived.

298
00:22:03,283 --> 00:22:05,776
Good. We can use you over there, Dr. Troy. curtained area.

299
00:22:05,868 --> 00:22:07,761
We got a 2-centimeter-long visible wound on the right-hand side--

300
00:22:07,773 --> 00:22:08,782
I'm busy here right now.

301
00:22:08,865 --> 00:22:10,576
It's one M.D. to a customer, doctor.

302
00:22:10,662 --> 00:22:12,791
There's a woman with a fork lodged in her chest bleeding to death

303
00:22:12,810 --> 00:22:14,754
because she was afraid she'd die waiting for medical attention,

304
00:22:14,841 --> 00:22:16,555
so she tried to remove it herself.

305
00:22:16,641 --> 00:22:17,835
You still busy?

306
00:22:22,182 --> 00:22:23,618
He's low on morphine, Sean.

307
00:22:23,712 --> 00:22:26,150
We need at least another 25 milligrams.

308
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:27,665
We need some morphine.

309
00:22:27,766 --> 00:22:29,331
Fentanyl, anything?

310
00:22:31,941 --> 00:22:33,255
We need something to put him out.

311
00:22:33,319 --> 00:22:36,375
Are you kidding? I want to watch.

312
00:22:41,541 --> 00:22:42,640
Christian!

313
00:22:43,529 --> 00:22:44,713
Oh, god!

314
00:22:46,154 --> 00:22:47,324
Thank you.

315
00:22:47,432 --> 00:22:48,918
Thank you for coming down.

316
00:22:49,006 --> 00:22:50,432
It's ok. We're all here.

317
00:22:50,724 --> 00:22:51,871
We're going to get through this together.

318
00:22:51,957 --> 00:22:54,653
I know, I know. Look, could you--just to make sure--

319
00:22:54,761 --> 00:22:57,579
this woman I was with, she was just talking to me and she just--

320
00:22:57,676 --> 00:23:01,065
her heart rate quickened and I--I think she's tachycardic.

321
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,024
She's--she's dead.

322
00:23:15,153 --> 00:23:16,907
There's nothing you can do for her now.

323
00:23:18,896 --> 00:23:24,163
Look, why don't you... go back to the hotel, or home, try and get some rest.

324
00:23:24,265 --> 00:23:26,723
No. I'm gonna stay.

325
00:23:26,889 --> 00:23:28,765
I need to find my mother.

326
00:23:44,350 --> 00:23:47,340
She's hypothermic. Her BP's dropping to 90 over 60.

327
00:23:47,430 --> 00:23:49,045
It may have nicked an artery.

328
00:23:49,996 --> 00:23:54,961
Give her O2 and 2 large-bore I.V.S., wide open.

329
00:24:00,558 --> 00:24:01,645
Miss me?

330
00:24:06,326 --> 00:24:09,956
I bet you wish I were dead in that crash, huh, baby?

331
00:24:10,995 --> 00:24:13,829
Then I'd finally be out of your head.

332
00:24:15,475 --> 00:24:17,067
Is everything all right, doctor?

333
00:24:19,288 --> 00:24:22,892
Uh, yeah, yeah. I'm fine. I just... a little tired.

334
00:24:23,084 --> 00:24:25,807
Uh, I need a--an angiocath.

335
00:24:27,431 --> 00:24:29,059
Am I gonna die?

336
00:24:31,148 --> 00:24:31,970
No.

337
00:24:32,358 --> 00:24:36,307
But  one of your lungs has collapsed, which means that I have to put a needle into your chest 

338
00:24:36,353 --> 00:24:39,634
so that I can reinflate it before I take out the...

339
00:24:39,968 --> 00:24:42,182
implement. Ok?

340
00:24:42,868 --> 00:24:44,439
- Here you go, doctor.
- Thank you.

341
00:24:46,987 --> 00:24:49,907
Why don't you just let me go, baby?

342
00:24:51,986 --> 00:24:54,596
I need some--some clamps, now.

343
00:24:57,188 --> 00:24:58,423
I'm still here.

344
00:24:59,205 --> 00:25:00,284
Here.

345
00:25:00,679 --> 00:25:01,709
There.

346
00:25:01,932 --> 00:25:03,360
And everywhere.

347
00:25:04,037 --> 00:25:07,264
Aren't you tired of carrying me around with you?

348
00:25:07,725 --> 00:25:09,434
Hon, let me go.

349
00:25:10,130 --> 00:25:11,399
Let me die.

350
00:25:14,313 --> 00:25:16,636
Where are the clamps?! Come on, give me the clamps!

351
00:25:16,725 --> 00:25:18,457
She--she's bleeding into the chest.

352
00:25:18,551 --> 00:25:20,268
Don't be afraid, baby.

353
00:25:20,596 --> 00:25:24,791
Death is just the ultimate orgasm of life.

354
00:25:28,991 --> 00:25:30,624
What is this? Give me something that I can use.

355
00:25:30,658 --> 00:25:33,066
This is all we've got. We're running out of instruments.

356
00:25:33,653 --> 00:25:35,044
Well, get me the oxygen.

357
00:25:35,624 --> 00:25:39,100
That's it, baby. I'm letting go.

358
00:25:42,790 --> 00:25:46,674
Yes, baby! I'm almost there.

359
00:25:47,432 --> 00:25:49,380
No. I can't.

360
00:25:49,510 --> 00:25:50,408
Yeah.

361
00:25:50,578 --> 00:25:51,555
I can't.

362
00:25:52,423 --> 00:25:54,307
Put pressure on this now. Come on, cover it.

363
00:25:55,654 --> 00:26:00,369
When you get her to the E.R., I want you to get a chest tube and some x-rays, all right?

364
00:26:02,626 --> 00:26:04,524
I'm not giving up on you, Kimber.

365
00:26:04,689 --> 00:26:06,103
My name is Karen.

366
00:26:06,479 --> 00:26:08,334
I'm sorry. Karen.

367
00:26:08,629 --> 00:26:10,029
You're gonna be fine.

368
00:26:11,633 --> 00:26:15,078
Hey, how am I supposed to see what's going on with all this stuff here?

369
00:26:15,162 --> 00:26:17,278
Try not to move your arms, Mr. Perri.

370
00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:20,159
Don't move your eyes...

371
00:26:20,244 --> 00:26:22,445
Sean, do it now before he comes down, I beg you.

372
00:26:22,775 --> 00:26:25,121
Once he does, he could go into cardiac arrest from the pain.

373
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:30,116
Set off alarms for me 'cause I'm in love...

374
00:26:32,755 --> 00:26:35,282
I've never performed this procedure with these.

375
00:26:35,388 --> 00:26:37,192
Sean, just do it.

376
00:26:37,372 --> 00:26:39,834
Keep singing, Mr. Perri. Come on, you have a lovely voice.

377
00:26:39,932 --> 00:26:44,145
Thank you. And now in honor of the bride and groom...

378
00:26:44,247 --> 00:26:47,110
When the moon hits your eye

379
00:26:47,206 --> 00:26:52,109
like a big pizza pie, that's amore...

380
00:26:54,130 --> 00:26:58,384
Bells will ring, ting-a-ling-a-ling--  come on. Ting-a-ling!

381
00:27:08,337 --> 00:27:09,906
- We're losing him, Sean.
- I know. I've almost got it.

382
00:27:10,003 --> 00:27:11,015
Do it.

383
00:27:19,453 --> 00:27:20,854
We're losing him, Sean.

384
00:27:20,950 --> 00:27:23,277
I've almost got it. Almost got it.

385
00:27:23,370 --> 00:27:24,446
Sorry.

386
00:27:25,787 --> 00:27:26,750
I got it.

387
00:27:27,431 --> 00:27:28,430
I got it.

388
00:27:38,839 --> 00:27:40,306
He's gone. Call it.

389
00:27:44,703 --> 00:27:46,804
Time of death 2:45 a.m.

390
00:27:47,268 --> 00:27:48,817
Are you all right, Dr. McNamara?

391
00:27:48,916 --> 00:27:50,514
He was gonna sing at his son's wedding.

392
00:27:50,621 --> 00:27:52,988
Yeah, well, that's a shame, but we can't think about that right now.

393
00:27:53,073 --> 00:27:54,491
You gave it your best shot.

394
00:27:56,631 --> 00:27:58,422
We shouldn't have done this here.

395
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:00,495
There was no way he was gonna make it. There was no way!

396
00:28:00,524 --> 00:28:03,780
The odds around here suck, doctor, but they're the only ones we got.

397
00:28:04,551 --> 00:28:07,265
I've got a severely burned patient that needs an allograft.

398
00:28:07,307 --> 00:28:08,495
This way.

399
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:17,031
This is bullshit!

400
00:28:17,125 --> 00:28:20,076
The patient's burnt skin has got to be excised to prevent bacterial infection.

401
00:28:20,177 --> 00:28:23,304
I need to cover the exposed tissue to prevent dehydration, atrophy.

402
00:28:23,393 --> 00:28:26,449
All right, all right. So you're suggesting we get donor skin from a human cadaver?

403
00:28:26,537 --> 00:28:28,373
A temporary measure just until we can get him to a burn unit

404
00:28:28,444 --> 00:28:29,848
where they'll do a permanent graft.

405
00:28:29,933 --> 00:28:32,845
A type O universal donor would lessen the chance of an allogenic reaction.

406
00:28:32,951 --> 00:28:35,515
Unfortunately, even if we started searching the morgue,

407
00:28:35,609 --> 00:28:37,264
identification would be impossible.

408
00:28:37,362 --> 00:28:38,724
I know someone.

409
00:28:38,815 --> 00:28:40,988
Her daughter told me she was a universal donor

410
00:28:41,065 --> 00:28:44,151
when we were filling out the identification forms.

411
00:28:44,263 --> 00:28:45,645
She's over here.

412
00:28:45,968 --> 00:28:47,043
Hold that gurney!

413
00:28:55,064 --> 00:28:57,687
Ok. So you'll excise the donor's dermis

414
00:28:57,773 --> 00:28:59,860
so I can cover the exposed tissue on my patient.

415
00:28:59,893 --> 00:29:00,993
Looks like there's plenty to harvest.

416
00:29:01,185 --> 00:29:02,637
How much are we talking about?

417
00:29:02,721 --> 00:29:04,115
Whatever's still usable.

418
00:29:12,453 --> 00:29:15,747
Do you want me to--to skin her?

419
00:29:15,921 --> 00:29:17,181
This is stuff you did in medical school.

420
00:29:17,266 --> 00:29:18,384
I know.

421
00:29:18,910 --> 00:29:19,972
Sorry.

422
00:29:22,984 --> 00:29:24,103
I need a break.

423
00:29:24,213 --> 00:29:25,463
- What? Are you--
- No.

424
00:29:31,691 --> 00:29:33,168
I can do it.

425
00:29:33,776 --> 00:29:34,936
You're not a doctor.

426
00:29:35,057 --> 00:29:36,702
She's already dead. I can't hurt her.

427
00:29:36,790 --> 00:29:39,583
You said yourself, this is stuff you do in med school.

428
00:29:41,816 --> 00:29:44,286
Besides, she'd want me to.

429
00:29:51,353 --> 00:29:53,359
I'll excise the patient's burnt areas.

430
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:55,041
You'll harvest the layers of skin from the donor.

431
00:29:55,132 --> 00:29:57,259
You've got to do it quickly and deeply, down to the dermis.

432
00:29:57,348 --> 00:29:59,164
We need to cover 4th-degree burns.

433
00:30:02,784 --> 00:30:05,158
Ok, med school, let's do it.

434
00:31:18,189 --> 00:31:20,875
Patient's been taken to the burn center. I think he's gonna make it.

435
00:31:21,216 --> 00:31:22,639
Good job, med school.

436
00:31:23,644 --> 00:31:25,156
I'm not still.

437
00:31:26,398 --> 00:31:28,611
I, uh, dropped out.

438
00:31:30,538 --> 00:31:32,185
That's a damn shame.

439
00:31:44,265 --> 00:31:45,979
Way to go, Helen.

440
00:31:46,756 --> 00:31:48,825
You just hit a home run.

441
00:32:03,741 --> 00:32:04,596
Julia...

442
00:32:11,844 --> 00:32:13,313
We found Erica.

443
00:32:15,603 --> 00:32:17,291
She didn't make it, sweetheart.

444
00:32:21,437 --> 00:32:22,975
Take me to her.

445
00:32:38,093 --> 00:32:41,710
Listen, Julia, the top half of her body is pretty badly burned.

446
00:32:41,750 --> 00:32:43,771
It's practically unrecognizable.

447
00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:46,359
Then how can you be sure it's her?

448
00:32:46,473 --> 00:32:48,766
There's identifying threads of the feather-lift that we gave her.

449
00:32:48,867 --> 00:32:52,507
She's the right height, right age, hair color and...

450
00:32:56,048 --> 00:32:57,186
And what?

451
00:32:59,222 --> 00:33:03,523
And the birthmark on her inner thigh is the shape of a diamond.

452
00:33:04,348 --> 00:33:05,927
It's still visible.

453
00:33:06,851 --> 00:33:08,971
Look, I know it's not that private, but

454
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:11,055
it's the best I could do.

455
00:33:12,258 --> 00:33:16,313
I'd like to be alone with her for a few minutes, if you don't mind.

456
00:33:45,665 --> 00:33:48,030
Mother, it's Julia.

457
00:33:49,396 --> 00:33:53,523
What I said at the spa, it was only the anger talking.

458
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:55,733
You know that, right?

459
00:34:11,245 --> 00:34:12,739
Do you remember--

460
00:34:13,772 --> 00:34:15,543
how old was I...

461
00:34:16,156 --> 00:34:19,685
about 5 or 6?

462
00:34:22,124 --> 00:34:25,239
And you and daddy had had this big fight, and...

463
00:34:26,559 --> 00:34:30,130
you took me by the hand, and you said,

464
00:34:31,918 --> 00:34:34,761
"Let's go, Julia. We're leaving."

465
00:34:35,987 --> 00:34:38,242
And we went outside,

466
00:34:39,555 --> 00:34:45,269
and we just walked for a long time in silence, holding hands.

467
00:34:46,321 --> 00:34:48,347
We went to the park...

468
00:34:53,859 --> 00:34:57,551
You showed me how to put a blade of grass in-between

469
00:34:57,652 --> 00:35:01,484
my thumbs and blow on it to make a noise.

470
00:35:01,639 --> 00:35:06,279
And how I laughed and... you took my face in your hands,

471
00:35:06,373 --> 00:35:10,653
and you said, "I love you, little girl."

472
00:35:11,416 --> 00:35:14,753
And I squeezed you so tight,

473
00:35:15,722 --> 00:35:17,275
and I said,

474
00:35:18,344 --> 00:35:20,792
"I love you, too, mommy."

475
00:35:22,524 --> 00:35:25,282
And we both knew it was true.

476
00:35:26,517 --> 00:35:28,130
Do you remember?

477
00:35:41,250 --> 00:35:45,026
And then one day... it wasn't true anymore.

478
00:35:49,755 --> 00:35:52,456
I forgive you for not loving me.

479
00:35:52,584 --> 00:35:54,151
It's ok.

480
00:35:55,484 --> 00:35:57,703
I didn't love you, either.

481
00:36:00,138 --> 00:36:01,447
I just...

482
00:36:02,531 --> 00:36:04,525
craved...

483
00:36:06,434 --> 00:36:09,153
your approval, like it was...

484
00:36:09,445 --> 00:36:11,768
somehow possible to get it.

485
00:36:16,285 --> 00:36:19,094
I saved a life tonight, mother.

486
00:36:19,409 --> 00:36:21,719
No. 2 lives, actually--

487
00:36:22,644 --> 00:36:25,273
a stranger's and my own.

488
00:36:30,590 --> 00:36:32,147
So it's ok.

489
00:36:34,607 --> 00:36:36,656
You can leave now.

490
00:36:39,006 --> 00:36:44,362
I don't need you to tell me who I am anymore.

491
00:38:17,503 --> 00:38:19,270
My mother's dead.

492
00:38:22,420 --> 00:38:24,655
Jules, I'm so sorry.

493
00:38:39,315 --> 00:38:43,305
- I feel so...
- Shaken. I can only imagine.

494
00:38:43,866 --> 00:38:44,842
No.

495
00:38:45,989 --> 00:38:47,031
Free.

496
00:38:51,999 --> 00:38:53,920
Am I a terrible person?

497
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:57,344
My mother just died and...

498
00:38:59,873 --> 00:39:04,541
and I feel like... everything's gonna be all right.

499
00:39:05,824 --> 00:39:08,683
You're a remarkable person, Jules.

500
00:39:09,747 --> 00:39:12,127
Every time I look at you in there,

501
00:39:12,223 --> 00:39:17,349
so capable and strong, unafraid of any of it.

502
00:39:22,314 --> 00:39:24,976
You would have been a much better doctor than I am.

503
00:39:33,811 --> 00:39:36,884
You know, I always thought I wish the one who could handle anything,

504
00:39:38,232 --> 00:39:40,890
who wasn't afraid to get his hands dirty,

505
00:39:41,809 --> 00:39:44,624
who could deal with all the shit that's just...

506
00:39:46,991 --> 00:39:48,277
part of life.

507
00:39:49,430 --> 00:39:53,403
I never wanted to know about Matt 'cause I couldn't live with the truth.

508
00:39:53,510 --> 00:39:55,650
I never asked about you and Christian

509
00:39:56,112 --> 00:39:59,413
because I couldn't deal with all the questions I'd have to ask about us.

510
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:04,581
You shouldn't be so hard on yourself.

511
00:40:06,438 --> 00:40:09,880
There's a reason I'm a plastic surgeon.

512
00:40:14,192 --> 00:40:16,962
If something's ugly, I fix it.

513
00:40:18,149 --> 00:40:22,676
What's imperfect, I make perfect. Wipe away the mess. Make it all nice.

514
00:40:23,849 --> 00:40:26,363
I couldn't do what these guys do:

515
00:40:27,138 --> 00:40:30,308
Life and death, losing more than you save,

516
00:40:30,402 --> 00:40:33,704
and moving on to the next, just one after the other.

517
00:40:35,927 --> 00:40:37,191
You could.

518
00:40:37,859 --> 00:40:38,862
Sean--

519
00:40:38,994 --> 00:40:43,830
All these years, all throughout our marriage, I left you to deal with it all:

520
00:40:45,326 --> 00:40:47,675
The mess of raising 2 kids...

521
00:40:51,309 --> 00:40:53,370
an unfaithful husband.

522
00:40:54,639 --> 00:40:56,170
You could hold it all--

523
00:40:56,404 --> 00:40:58,335
the good and the bad and...

524
00:40:59,557 --> 00:41:01,794
all the grays in-between .

525
00:41:08,766 --> 00:41:11,341
I'm not the man I thought I was.

526
00:41:44,702 --> 00:41:45,797
My god.

527
00:41:47,675 --> 00:41:49,785
I've been up all night. I've been trying to reach you.

528
00:41:50,877 --> 00:41:53,575
My cell battery died hours ago.

529
00:41:54,643 --> 00:41:59,126
Well, I called the airport. They weren't releasing any information. Any--any news?

530
00:42:00,765 --> 00:42:01,679
No...

531
00:42:02,665 --> 00:42:03,875
not yet.

532
00:42:04,082 --> 00:42:05,598
Gosh, you must be wiped.

533
00:42:06,587 --> 00:42:09,326
How about I give you a little massage? I have some time until my 7:00.

534
00:42:09,429 --> 00:42:12,674
You can let your feelings out. You can cry. Whatever you need, I'm here for you.

535
00:42:12,764 --> 00:42:14,088
Don't be.

536
00:42:14,390 --> 00:42:15,723
Don't be here.

537
00:42:15,833 --> 00:42:17,380
I want you out.

538
00:42:18,914 --> 00:42:22,666
Look, about yesterday...

539
00:42:23,912 --> 00:42:26,262
sometimes people misinterpret me

540
00:42:26,528 --> 00:42:28,463
until they get to know me.

541
00:42:33,204 --> 00:42:34,698
I know you.

542
00:42:35,043 --> 00:42:39,851
I know you're someone who can only be big by making others feel small.

543
00:42:40,453 --> 00:42:44,043
I know I don't need people like you in my life anymore,

544
00:42:44,159 --> 00:42:46,233
and I know you're fired.

545
00:42:49,418 --> 00:42:51,281
What about my 7:00 rhinoplasty?

546
00:42:51,383 --> 00:42:54,920
Canceled, as are the rest of your surgeries.

547
00:42:56,260 --> 00:42:57,556
You're a bitch.

548
00:42:59,944 --> 00:43:01,126
Maybe...

549
00:43:01,272 --> 00:43:03,342
but at least I'm not yours.

550
00:43:28,725 --> 00:43:33,401
Ahh, sweetheart. I've been waiting for you all night.

551
00:43:33,562 --> 00:43:36,901
I couldn't leave the way things are between us.

552
00:43:39,167 --> 00:43:41,356
Did you hear the news?

553
00:43:41,569 --> 00:43:45,251
That earlier flight you wanted me on crashed.

554
00:43:49,617 --> 00:43:52,101
