00:00:01,553 --> 00:00:03,487
<i>Previously on</i> Nip / Tuck:

2
00:00:03,821 --> 00:00:06,085
I'm telling you, man-to-man.

3
00:00:06,157 --> 00:00:07,488
I'm having an affair.

4
00:00:07,559 --> 00:00:08,821
You cheated on Mom?

5
00:00:08,893 --> 00:00:10,190
I won't see her again.

6
00:00:10,261 --> 00:00:13,128
The cancer's metastasized
in my lymph nodes.

7
00:00:13,197 --> 00:00:14,562
It's already stage four.

8
00:00:18,036 --> 00:00:19,264
Marker.

9
00:00:19,837 --> 00:00:21,202
Thank you.

10
00:00:21,372 --> 00:00:22,600
Scalpel.

11
00:00:24,676 --> 00:00:25,665
Thumb.

12
00:00:27,612 --> 00:00:28,738
Lawnmower?

13
00:00:28,813 --> 00:00:31,008
Garbage disposal. Guy's a plumber.

14
00:00:31,082 --> 00:00:33,880
The power surged,
and he's picking his nose with his elbow.

15
00:00:33,952 --> 00:00:35,886
-No room at the ER?
-HospitaI phobic.

16
00:00:35,954 --> 00:00:38,445
He caught a nasty Staph infection
at County last year.

17
00:00:38,523 --> 00:00:42,823
I took the cold call an hour ago.
I am happy to take the cold, hard cash.

18
00:00:42,894 --> 00:00:45,294
Maestro, some music, please.

19
00:00:54,872 --> 00:00:56,863
-How much have you lost?
-15 pounds.

20
00:00:56,941 --> 00:00:59,341
I make ketosis as we speak. Atkins.

21
00:00:59,410 --> 00:01:02,243
Would you hens quit squawking?
I'm trying to concentrate here.

22
00:01:02,313 --> 00:01:06,181
You better concentrate harder, Christian.
You attached those wrong.

23
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:07,649
Oh, my God.

24
00:01:09,988 --> 00:01:12,957
You put the index finger
where the middle finger should be.

25
00:01:13,024 --> 00:01:15,185
-No, I didn't.
-Yes, you did, Christian.

26
00:01:15,259 --> 00:01:17,887
He's a two-sy. Look at his other hand.

27
00:01:18,396 --> 00:01:21,456
The middle finger
is longer than the index finger.

28
00:01:22,367 --> 00:01:25,268
-Liz, didn't you just get LASlK surgery?
-Two weeks ago.

29
00:01:25,336 --> 00:01:26,428
Go back. It didn't work.

30
00:01:26,504 --> 00:01:29,302
Okay, this is bullshit. I'm getting Sean.

31
00:01:37,148 --> 00:01:39,673
Hey, Dad, here to pull over the car?

32
00:01:41,653 --> 00:01:43,018
-Oh, Christ.
-What?

33
00:01:43,087 --> 00:01:46,454
Liz is right.
You attached these fingers incorrectly.

34
00:01:48,626 --> 00:01:51,652
-It's a matter of millimeters. I don't see--
-That's the problem.

35
00:01:51,729 --> 00:01:56,189
Not only do you not see the error,
but you'd rather argue than correct it.

36
00:01:58,803 --> 00:02:01,533
-I'll fix it.
-No, I'll fix it. You can assist.

37
00:02:01,606 --> 00:02:02,698
It's my patient.

38
00:02:02,774 --> 00:02:05,868
Who's already been under anesthesia
for four hours.

39
00:02:06,277 --> 00:02:07,767
You want to aim for eight...

40
00:02:07,845 --> 00:02:11,941
or do you want to swallow your pride
and let me knock it out in six?

41
00:02:18,289 --> 00:02:21,486
-Well, at least he got the thumb right.
-15 blade.

42
00:02:42,146 --> 00:02:46,515
Better hope your assignment
at recertification isn't digit microsurgery.

43
00:02:52,824 --> 00:02:54,724
You had a rough month.

44
00:02:55,159 --> 00:02:58,651
The priest, the Kimber incident.
You just need a vacation.

45
00:02:58,730 --> 00:03:00,789
Don't make excuses for me, Sean.

46
00:03:01,632 --> 00:03:05,398
Let's just finally say out loud
what we've both known for years.

47
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:08,030
I am a goddamn terrible surgeon.

48
00:03:10,241 --> 00:03:12,607
Why do you even
want to be my partner, anyway?

49
00:03:12,677 --> 00:03:15,874
I'm proud of the business
we started from nothing.

50
00:03:16,714 --> 00:03:18,511
We're self-made men.

51
00:03:19,016 --> 00:03:22,144
You said it best
a couple of months ago. We fit.

52
00:03:22,253 --> 00:03:25,017
-You're the planner--
-And you're the talent.

53
00:03:25,089 --> 00:03:28,718
I've slid by on your skill for years,
and we both know it.

54
00:03:30,895 --> 00:03:33,762
I was in the bottom 10°%
of our class, Sean.

55
00:03:33,965 --> 00:03:36,433
The only reason I passed
was because you tutored me...

56
00:03:36,501 --> 00:03:39,163
and wouldn't give up untiI l'd learned it.

57
00:03:39,237 --> 00:03:41,102
But I never became it.

58
00:03:41,906 --> 00:03:43,339
I'm a mimic.

59
00:03:43,841 --> 00:03:45,536
I'm a myna bird with a scalpel.

60
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:47,237
No, worse.

61
00:03:47,712 --> 00:03:49,771
I'm Bobolit in better suits.

62
00:03:51,415 --> 00:03:54,976
I don't exceI at anything.
Relationships, my profession.

63
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:58,950
All I have to offer is a great smile...

64
00:03:59,557 --> 00:04:02,025
and a convincing line of bullshit.

65
00:04:57,748 --> 00:04:59,682
I've been going over your Q-TWiST.

66
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:01,012
My what?

67
00:05:01,185 --> 00:05:02,482
Your Q-TWiST.

68
00:05:02,553 --> 00:05:06,421
It's a statisticaI method
that provides a measure of survivaI time...

69
00:05:06,490 --> 00:05:08,958
weighted by a patient's quality of life.

70
00:05:09,026 --> 00:05:12,621
Quality time without symptoms
and toxicity: Q-TWiST.

71
00:05:13,364 --> 00:05:15,730
-That's very clever.
-And useful.

72
00:05:15,867 --> 00:05:19,894
It's how we determine if an alternative
course of treatment is warranted.

73
00:05:19,971 --> 00:05:22,769
lf? There's no "if" unless
it's followed by a "then."

74
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:25,638
lf tamoxifen doesn't work,
then we try something else.

75
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:27,610
ExperimentaI trials, clinicaI trials.

76
00:05:27,678 --> 00:05:29,976
I'm a doctor.
I'll pull whatever strings I need to.

77
00:05:30,047 --> 00:05:31,605
Dr. McNamara, when you compare...

78
00:05:31,682 --> 00:05:35,243
the patient's overall survival
with his or her clinicaI health state--

79
00:05:35,319 --> 00:05:37,184
The patient's name is Megan.

80
00:05:37,288 --> 00:05:40,257
Yes, and according to Megan's Q-TWiST--

81
00:05:40,324 --> 00:05:42,315
She'd be better off dead.

82
00:05:45,263 --> 00:05:48,027
Megan, there are always ways of fighting.

83
00:05:49,166 --> 00:05:53,569
It's entirely up to you to decide
whether the benefits outweigh the costs.

84
00:05:55,973 --> 00:05:59,101
-Could you give us a minute, please?
-Certainly.

85
00:06:04,048 --> 00:06:07,745
We should go somewhere and talk
about options. What we want to do.

86
00:06:07,818 --> 00:06:09,342
I can't, Sean.

87
00:06:10,554 --> 00:06:12,044
I'm exhausted.

88
00:06:12,890 --> 00:06:15,723
All the chemo
that I didn't want to have again...

89
00:06:15,793 --> 00:06:17,658
because I knew it wouldn't work this time.

90
00:06:17,728 --> 00:06:20,561
Okay. We'll do it tonight, after you rest.

91
00:06:21,666 --> 00:06:24,430
We made plans to celebrate
your last treatment.

92
00:06:24,502 --> 00:06:27,437
Now we'll celebrate
you finding a new doctor.

93
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:36,637
Mr. Charles, tell me
what you don't like about yourself.

94
00:06:36,714 --> 00:06:38,443
Let me see.

95
00:06:38,616 --> 00:06:41,676
I should be more patient
with my grandkids...

96
00:06:43,187 --> 00:06:46,623
and I shouldn't take my golf game
so damn seriously.

97
00:06:46,691 --> 00:06:50,559
Darling, no need for the windy analysis.

98
00:06:51,228 --> 00:06:55,164
Dr. Troy just wants to make sure
that you want a scrotaI lift.

99
00:06:55,232 --> 00:06:57,166
That you're not doing it just for me.

100
00:06:57,234 --> 00:07:00,294
Well, sure. It's never too late to look good.

101
00:07:00,671 --> 00:07:03,936
I wouldn't mind having
the cousin spruced up...

102
00:07:04,008 --> 00:07:06,340
and lifted off the floor.

103
00:07:07,278 --> 00:07:09,109
lsn't he just a doll?

104
00:07:09,547 --> 00:07:11,310
Now, Dr. Troy, write this down.

105
00:07:11,382 --> 00:07:14,681
We need to reserve both beds
in the recovery suite.

106
00:07:16,087 --> 00:07:17,145
Why?

107
00:07:17,321 --> 00:07:19,983
Because I will be recuperating as well.

108
00:07:20,057 --> 00:07:22,287
From my vaginaI rejuvenation.

109
00:07:22,626 --> 00:07:25,220
You see, Dr. Troy,
just because Sumner and l...

110
00:07:25,296 --> 00:07:29,232
are going to grow old together
doesn't mean we have to look old.

111
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:32,665
Strip us naked,
it's like <i>The Pit and the Pendulum.</i>

112
00:07:32,737 --> 00:07:35,763
We just want to freshen up
before the wedding.

113
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:38,032
You two are engaged?

114
00:07:38,109 --> 00:07:39,406
Congratulations.

115
00:07:39,477 --> 00:07:41,536
I've never been wealthier.

116
00:07:41,679 --> 00:07:43,237
On every level.

117
00:07:44,382 --> 00:07:46,748
And as you know, Dr. Troy...

118
00:07:46,884 --> 00:07:50,718
"free" is a word that us wealthy folks...

119
00:07:51,756 --> 00:07:53,189
just love.

120
00:07:58,195 --> 00:08:00,663
Mrs. Grubman, we are obligated...

121
00:08:00,731 --> 00:08:04,326
and, in fact, delighted
to do all of your cosmetic surgeries.

122
00:08:04,402 --> 00:08:08,736
But it does not include operations
for your friends and fiancé.

123
00:08:08,839 --> 00:08:10,773
Yes, it does, Dr. Troy.

124
00:08:10,975 --> 00:08:14,775
And don't think for one minute
I can't call up my lawyer next week...

125
00:08:14,845 --> 00:08:16,710
or even a year from now and say:

126
00:08:16,781 --> 00:08:19,841
"The veils have fallen from my eyes.

127
00:08:19,984 --> 00:08:22,976
"I now see that we have to sue
McNamara / Troy...

128
00:08:23,054 --> 00:08:25,147
"for every cent they have."

129
00:08:26,123 --> 00:08:27,818
lsn't she a tiger?

130
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:32,720
Your fiancée is very persuasive.

131
00:08:32,997 --> 00:08:35,761
Which rhymes with "invasive"...

132
00:08:35,933 --> 00:08:38,333
which I'm sorry to say, is a risk...

133
00:08:38,402 --> 00:08:40,427
I can't run with you again.

134
00:08:40,504 --> 00:08:42,529
-Sorry?
-Of course.

135
00:08:42,606 --> 00:08:45,632
You can lift Sumner's testicles.
I read the literature on that.

136
00:08:45,709 --> 00:08:46,698
It's a simple tuck.

137
00:08:46,777 --> 00:08:50,645
But I'm going to need Dr. McNamara
to perform my operation.

138
00:08:52,583 --> 00:08:54,983
At least that way
I'll have some confidence...

139
00:08:55,052 --> 00:08:59,182
that I won't wake up
with a cautery tip lodged in my uterus.

140
00:09:03,694 --> 00:09:05,855
That check? Nonrefundable.

141
00:09:05,996 --> 00:09:08,430
Even if you faiI recertification.

142
00:09:08,866 --> 00:09:11,357
Also, you should be aware
that if you do fail...

143
00:09:11,435 --> 00:09:15,064
you have to block out another week
of afternoons to take the test again...

144
00:09:15,139 --> 00:09:17,972
and you can't practice untiI you pass it.

145
00:09:18,409 --> 00:09:19,433
Thanks.

146
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:22,536
Don't forget your scrubs
and your instruments.

147
00:09:23,981 --> 00:09:26,176
Recertifications every 10 years?

148
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:28,718
Boys, we have got to stop
meeting like this.

149
00:09:28,786 --> 00:09:31,983
-I haven't seen you two since--
-Since graduation.

150
00:09:33,090 --> 00:09:35,320
My, how time and hairlines fly.

151
00:09:35,392 --> 00:09:39,590
Actually, that's not true, Christian.
You've seen him severaI times.

152
00:09:39,997 --> 00:09:41,396
The billboards?

153
00:09:41,465 --> 00:09:44,957
Featuring you and two strippers
with Hindenburgs in their chests.

154
00:09:45,035 --> 00:09:46,525
Classy stuff, Merrill.

155
00:09:46,604 --> 00:09:49,971
You're really upgrading the image
of an already beleaguered profession.

156
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:52,031
-Congratulations.
-Sean!

157
00:09:52,143 --> 00:09:54,611
Retract those claws. No, wait, you can't.

158
00:09:54,678 --> 00:09:58,512
Now that I'm stealing all your business,
you need them to scratch out a living.

159
00:09:58,582 --> 00:10:01,312
A warning: I may be forced
to tell the teacher...

160
00:10:01,385 --> 00:10:04,843
if I catch you cheating off my paper.
Or should I say head?

161
00:10:10,261 --> 00:10:13,719
Doctors, please introduce yourselves
to your patients.

162
00:10:17,101 --> 00:10:18,261
Great.

163
00:10:18,435 --> 00:10:20,232
I get the fat chick.

164
00:10:20,337 --> 00:10:22,532
From experience,
we know that many of you...

165
00:10:22,606 --> 00:10:24,471
find operating on a cadaver's head...

166
00:10:24,542 --> 00:10:27,841
to be an impersonal,
somewhat unsettling experience.

167
00:10:28,345 --> 00:10:32,076
We want to help with that.
So, at this time, if you wish...

168
00:10:32,416 --> 00:10:36,045
please feeI free to examine
your cadaver's personaI biography.

169
00:10:53,571 --> 00:10:56,131
-Yes?
-l'd like another head, please.

170
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:59,131
-Why?
-I have large hands...

171
00:10:59,543 --> 00:11:03,001
and as you can see,
this is the head of a small person.

172
00:11:03,214 --> 00:11:06,377
I won't be able to
properly manipulate the cranium, see?

173
00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:10,250
Dr. Troy, we only have a certain number
of bodies donated to science.

174
00:11:10,321 --> 00:11:13,779
To match a cadaver's head
with every surgeon was no small feat.

175
00:11:13,857 --> 00:11:17,190
We had to put out a call to four counties
to make sure we had enough.

176
00:11:17,261 --> 00:11:20,788
I'm sorry, but you're just gonna
have to make this work.

177
00:11:22,866 --> 00:11:26,495
Ladies and gentlemen, the first operation
for Boards is the rhinoplasty.

178
00:11:26,570 --> 00:11:28,231
You have one hour.

179
00:11:31,742 --> 00:11:32,834
Begin.

180
00:11:37,047 --> 00:11:39,777
lf you'd rather not discuss this now,
we don't have to.

181
00:11:39,850 --> 00:11:43,081
I'm just saying I went to med school
with this guy in Atlanta...

182
00:11:43,153 --> 00:11:45,678
who's been combining
lnsulin Potentiation Therapy...

183
00:11:45,756 --> 00:11:47,018
with this new drug, Ukrain.

184
00:11:47,091 --> 00:11:50,618
ls that Debussy or Scriabin?
I always get them confused.

185
00:11:51,428 --> 00:11:53,191
I wasn't listening.

186
00:11:53,597 --> 00:11:54,825
I know.

187
00:12:02,539 --> 00:12:04,166
Close your eyes.

188
00:12:14,084 --> 00:12:17,110
I used to play that when I was a little girl.

189
00:12:21,325 --> 00:12:23,190
It's beautiful, Megan.

190
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:27,356
It's funny. I hardly ever pay attention
to the music in a restaurant.

191
00:12:28,632 --> 00:12:31,362
You haven't been on a lot of bad dates.

192
00:12:32,202 --> 00:12:36,104
I've heard some entire symphonies
during some awkward silences.

193
00:12:39,076 --> 00:12:40,202
More?

194
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:43,774
No, but feeI free.

195
00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:49,283
-Excuse me, are you done?
-Yes, thank you.

196
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,751
You sure? You barely ate.

197
00:12:51,822 --> 00:12:54,188
-I could leave it here if you like.
-No, it's fine.

198
00:12:54,258 --> 00:12:56,249
You want to take it home?

199
00:12:56,493 --> 00:12:58,484
You may get hungry later.

200
00:13:02,866 --> 00:13:03,992
Shit.

201
00:13:07,771 --> 00:13:09,466
-Sorry.
-Please don't worry about it.

202
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:11,735
We'll get this taken care of.

203
00:13:17,848 --> 00:13:21,409
I shouldn't have made you come.
You said you were tired.

204
00:13:22,786 --> 00:13:24,083
Are you kidding?

205
00:13:24,154 --> 00:13:27,851
I've been trying to get a reservation
at this place for years.

206
00:13:27,925 --> 00:13:30,450
That'll teach them, damn snobs.

207
00:13:32,996 --> 00:13:35,021
At least it was romantic.

208
00:13:36,133 --> 00:13:38,067
Things will get better.

209
00:13:44,441 --> 00:13:46,568
You know, I don't think so.

210
00:13:49,313 --> 00:13:51,076
And neither do you.

211
00:13:53,150 --> 00:13:56,278
My body is expressing its opinion
very clearly.

212
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:58,879
Uncontrollable vomiting...

213
00:14:00,657 --> 00:14:02,648
loss of all my senses...

214
00:14:04,228 --> 00:14:06,128
diminished lucidity...

215
00:14:08,632 --> 00:14:11,260
a dramatic increase in pain...

216
00:14:12,236 --> 00:14:14,170
and a pretty excruciating death.

217
00:14:14,238 --> 00:14:17,366
And I will be there with you
every step of the way.

218
00:14:17,441 --> 00:14:21,605
That's going to make it pretty hard
to keep this thing under wraps.

219
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:27,217
lf you're rushing to my sickbed,
Julia's likely to notice after a while.

220
00:14:30,621 --> 00:14:33,454
I don't want a long-drawn-out death, Sean.

221
00:14:35,025 --> 00:14:36,549
I really don't.

222
00:14:38,862 --> 00:14:41,296
I want a quick and peacefuI one...

223
00:14:42,533 --> 00:14:44,524
that's under my control.

224
00:14:45,068 --> 00:14:47,229
That's what we all hope for.

225
00:14:53,577 --> 00:14:55,670
I'm gonna do more than hope.

226
00:15:13,363 --> 00:15:14,694
Can you believe that bitch?

227
00:15:14,765 --> 00:15:18,701
lnsinuating I'm a terrible surgeon
while she's blackmailing me.

228
00:15:19,002 --> 00:15:21,835
You're the one who left
the cautery tip in her gut, not me.

229
00:15:21,905 --> 00:15:24,430
I've done some of my best work
on the Grim Reaper there.

230
00:15:24,508 --> 00:15:27,636
lf it weren't for me, she'd look her age.
Screw her.

231
00:15:27,811 --> 00:15:30,644
I may slip up now and then,
but I am not devoid of skill.

232
00:15:30,714 --> 00:15:34,275
You may be the carpenter, but I am
the construction worker around here.

233
00:15:34,351 --> 00:15:37,013
I lay the foundations that you refine.

234
00:15:37,221 --> 00:15:39,689
-That's right.
-I'm gonna pass the recertification.

235
00:15:39,756 --> 00:15:41,917
I'm gonna work harder,
be less complacent.

236
00:15:41,992 --> 00:15:45,553
I'm gonna apply myself
and not coast by anymore on slick.

237
00:15:49,233 --> 00:15:51,201
We have to switch heads.

238
00:15:51,735 --> 00:15:52,759
What?

239
00:15:52,836 --> 00:15:56,067
I cannot pass with these big mitts
and that midget head.

240
00:15:56,139 --> 00:15:58,869
You operated on a cadaver head in college.
You passed.

241
00:15:58,942 --> 00:16:02,469
ln college, they let you slide by
on youth and hubris.

242
00:16:02,646 --> 00:16:04,910
They're tougher on you
in the recertification.

243
00:16:04,982 --> 00:16:08,577
Let's face it. I can do a nose job,
and certainly a brilliant tit job...

244
00:16:08,652 --> 00:16:11,416
but you're the craniofaciaI man, not me.

245
00:16:11,755 --> 00:16:14,383
You do most of our face-lifts.
It's not my specialty.

246
00:16:14,458 --> 00:16:18,087
Whenever I have done them,
you've been there to supervise.

247
00:16:19,229 --> 00:16:22,665
What am I gonna do? I can't fail.

248
00:16:22,733 --> 00:16:25,861
I can't have Bobolit laugh at me,
and I can't let Grubman be right.

249
00:16:25,936 --> 00:16:27,665
Practice makes perfect.

250
00:16:27,905 --> 00:16:30,635
Practice on what, Sean, Mr. Potato Head?

251
00:16:30,707 --> 00:16:33,642
It's not like I can brush up on a fetaI pig.

252
00:16:35,212 --> 00:16:37,442
There is only one thing to do.

253
00:16:38,382 --> 00:16:40,816
Kill Grubman and practice on her.

254
00:16:42,319 --> 00:16:44,378
What did your head die of?

255
00:16:46,356 --> 00:16:48,119
Heart attack. Yours?

256
00:16:48,458 --> 00:16:49,720
Suicide.

257
00:16:50,694 --> 00:16:52,491
You believe in that?

258
00:16:53,564 --> 00:16:56,158
I think if a person
is in a great deaI of pain...

259
00:16:56,233 --> 00:16:59,464
physicaI or spiritual,
and they've exhausted all their options...

260
00:16:59,536 --> 00:17:01,527
I wouldn't judge them for it.

261
00:17:01,605 --> 00:17:05,974
l'd say a silent prayer and hope they found
the peace life couldn't give them.

262
00:17:07,711 --> 00:17:12,148
I'll assist with the beef curtains
and then we'll wheeI in ColoneI Sanders.

263
00:17:23,226 --> 00:17:24,625
Forgive me?

264
00:17:25,295 --> 00:17:28,753
You did save me from a negligence suit.
Why not?

265
00:17:28,999 --> 00:17:32,765
The very fact that we can continue
to coexist in semi-hatred....

266
00:17:32,836 --> 00:17:34,701
I am bathed in relief.

267
00:17:38,041 --> 00:17:39,838
Anything interesting?

268
00:17:41,645 --> 00:17:44,842
Slow news day.
More scandaI in the police department.

269
00:17:44,915 --> 00:17:47,281
A little old homeless lady died.

270
00:17:47,784 --> 00:17:48,773
Little?

271
00:17:48,852 --> 00:17:53,289
A Jane Doe found unclaimed and dead
underneath a palm at the beach.

272
00:17:53,757 --> 00:17:55,782
-FouI play?
-NaturaI causes.

273
00:17:55,859 --> 00:17:58,191
They think she went to sit down to rest,
and kicked.

274
00:17:58,261 --> 00:17:59,819
Poor thing, she had no lD.

275
00:17:59,896 --> 00:18:02,160
They suspect she was around 80 years old.

276
00:18:02,232 --> 00:18:03,460
Weight?

277
00:18:04,901 --> 00:18:06,960
5' tall, 98 pounds.

278
00:18:07,571 --> 00:18:08,697
Sad.

279
00:18:28,725 --> 00:18:31,751
lf you want to see dead people,
you check with me first.

280
00:18:31,828 --> 00:18:33,728
Coroner's Office, Christian Troy.

281
00:18:33,797 --> 00:18:36,766
I'm here to investigate
a certain South Beach Jane Doe.

282
00:18:36,833 --> 00:18:37,925
lD?

283
00:18:40,170 --> 00:18:42,661
-I must've left it at home.
-Shame.

284
00:18:44,107 --> 00:18:46,667
Look, I'm here on officiaI business.

285
00:18:47,044 --> 00:18:48,944
It's officiaI business.

286
00:18:49,012 --> 00:18:50,639
That's different.

287
00:18:51,148 --> 00:18:53,480
What other business
would I have with a corpse?

288
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:55,142
Monkey business.

289
00:18:55,819 --> 00:19:00,415
Two months ago, I walked in on a guy
getting his freak on with his dead ex.

290
00:19:01,058 --> 00:19:03,993
Wanted to do it once
without her criticizing.

291
00:19:07,497 --> 00:19:09,829
I don't usually get criticized.

292
00:19:13,336 --> 00:19:14,963
I bet you don't.

293
00:19:15,639 --> 00:19:17,504
Not looking like that.

294
00:19:18,108 --> 00:19:19,598
Gucci suit...

295
00:19:20,010 --> 00:19:21,341
Rolex.

296
00:19:21,712 --> 00:19:23,407
One fancy coroner.

297
00:19:24,281 --> 00:19:27,648
I'm guessing you're either moonlighting
as an investment banker...

298
00:19:27,718 --> 00:19:30,812
or you're stealing this shit
off of dead people.

299
00:19:31,855 --> 00:19:34,722
Now you better tell me
what you want and why you're here...

300
00:19:34,791 --> 00:19:37,817
or else I'm going to tell security
that we have a problem...

301
00:19:37,894 --> 00:19:40,192
with a male modeI necrophiliac.

302
00:19:41,131 --> 00:19:42,928
I like your cologne.

303
00:19:43,333 --> 00:19:45,301
-Lagerfeld?
-Dialing.

304
00:19:50,273 --> 00:19:51,638
All right.

305
00:19:51,775 --> 00:19:53,242
I'm a plastic surgeon.

306
00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:55,471
Honey, it's way too late for these people.

307
00:19:55,545 --> 00:19:57,911
I just need the right kind of head.

308
00:19:59,583 --> 00:20:00,709
Okay.

309
00:20:01,151 --> 00:20:02,448
To practice on.

310
00:20:02,519 --> 00:20:05,852
I'm taking an exam, and if I fail,
I'm screwed.

311
00:20:06,156 --> 00:20:07,248
Shit.

312
00:20:09,826 --> 00:20:12,260
You want to practice on Jane Doe?

313
00:20:12,662 --> 00:20:14,789
I'm all about a trade.

314
00:20:15,065 --> 00:20:17,056
I could give you some new pecs.

315
00:20:17,134 --> 00:20:19,659
Ain't nothing wrong with my pecs.

316
00:20:19,736 --> 00:20:22,136
Worked my ass off for these pecs.

317
00:20:31,948 --> 00:20:33,279
I never...

318
00:20:34,050 --> 00:20:35,540
liked my chin.

319
00:20:41,758 --> 00:20:43,623
You've got one hour.

320
00:20:45,996 --> 00:20:48,521
I'll come by next week to schedule.

321
00:21:08,051 --> 00:21:10,485
It sucks getting old, doesn't it?

322
00:21:23,033 --> 00:21:24,523
No pictures of me?

323
00:21:24,601 --> 00:21:26,762
I'll have memories of you...

324
00:21:27,671 --> 00:21:30,003
and you'll have memories of me.

325
00:21:31,708 --> 00:21:33,767
We can make more memories.

326
00:21:34,845 --> 00:21:36,676
We could go to Paris.

327
00:21:37,113 --> 00:21:39,445
I always wanted to go to Paris.

328
00:21:41,151 --> 00:21:43,585
But if you can only walk
for a few minutes...

329
00:21:43,653 --> 00:21:46,144
and you can't drink all that wine...

330
00:21:46,223 --> 00:21:48,248
and you can't have sex...

331
00:21:49,059 --> 00:21:51,584
all you've got is the architecture.

332
00:21:52,395 --> 00:21:54,761
And I'm not so much for architecture.

333
00:21:58,702 --> 00:22:01,034
But you like this moteI by the sea.

334
00:22:01,104 --> 00:22:02,162
No.

335
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:04,967
I like this room.

336
00:22:07,177 --> 00:22:10,044
This room was the last place I feIt happy.

337
00:22:13,149 --> 00:22:15,913
This room is the last place I feIt hope.

338
00:22:20,156 --> 00:22:24,149
And you heard what the doctor said, Sean.
There is no more hope.

339
00:22:27,564 --> 00:22:29,930
All I can hope for is dignity...

340
00:22:32,736 --> 00:22:34,863
and a nice sunset tomorrow.

341
00:22:35,772 --> 00:22:38,263
-I won't let you do this.
-It's not your decision.

342
00:22:38,341 --> 00:22:41,538
-I just found you!
-And now you have to let me go.

343
00:22:44,314 --> 00:22:46,214
I don't fear death, Sean.

344
00:22:47,450 --> 00:22:49,645
I fear the prolongment of it.

345
00:22:52,088 --> 00:22:54,022
I can't condone this...

346
00:22:54,291 --> 00:22:56,816
or help you, Megan. This is rash.

347
00:22:57,294 --> 00:22:58,784
This is right.

348
00:23:06,903 --> 00:23:08,336
It's like...

349
00:23:11,141 --> 00:23:13,974
when you're a kid at an amusement park...

350
00:23:14,577 --> 00:23:17,137
and you're having the greatest time.

351
00:23:17,914 --> 00:23:21,509
lce cream and Ferris wheels
and stuffed animals.

352
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:27,617
And it gets late,
and you beg your parents to let you stay.

353
00:23:28,291 --> 00:23:31,351
You'll be so good,
you'll do anything they ask.

354
00:23:33,229 --> 00:23:34,890
So they say, "Okay."

355
00:23:37,834 --> 00:23:39,233
Only now...

356
00:23:40,403 --> 00:23:42,667
the steps are harder to climb.

357
00:23:42,772 --> 00:23:44,706
You have a tummy ache...

358
00:23:44,774 --> 00:23:48,505
and you're too tired to wait in line
for the rides anymore.

359
00:23:51,481 --> 00:23:53,745
And suddenly you begin to cry.

360
00:24:14,704 --> 00:24:16,501
It's no fun anymore.

361
00:24:26,483 --> 00:24:29,884
And you hear your mom's voice saying:

362
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:33,417
"Megan, when are you gonna learn
enough's enough?"

363
00:25:07,323 --> 00:25:10,156
We will start with the bicoronaI incision.

364
00:25:10,827 --> 00:25:12,920
And begin.

365
00:25:30,213 --> 00:25:33,307
-ls there a problem, Dr. Troy?
-No, Dr. Hiroshi.

366
00:25:35,351 --> 00:25:36,750
No problem at all.

367
00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:39,584
I hope you finish better than you begin.

368
00:25:55,572 --> 00:25:57,563
Can you do my eyes next?

369
00:25:57,841 --> 00:26:00,901
-I hate these crow's feet.
-I'm under stress.

370
00:26:01,511 --> 00:26:02,910
What's new?

371
00:26:03,113 --> 00:26:04,740
You're not real.

372
00:26:04,881 --> 00:26:06,781
This is my subconscious talking.

373
00:26:06,850 --> 00:26:09,080
Always with the intellectual.

374
00:26:09,252 --> 00:26:12,278
That mindset comes in handy,
doesn't it, Sean?

375
00:26:12,722 --> 00:26:15,282
When you're operating on the dead...

376
00:26:15,859 --> 00:26:18,953
or you're trying to talk your girlfriend
out of killing herself.

377
00:26:19,028 --> 00:26:20,256
Shut up!

378
00:26:20,630 --> 00:26:22,427
You mind if I talk while you work?

379
00:26:22,499 --> 00:26:23,966
You're not real.

380
00:26:24,033 --> 00:26:26,627
Death is an illusion, Sean.

381
00:26:27,103 --> 00:26:29,003
It's love that remains.

382
00:26:29,372 --> 00:26:33,866
You should know that your love for Megan
will remain even when she's gone.

383
00:26:34,844 --> 00:26:37,608
And so, for that matter,
will your love for Julia...

384
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:41,707
when she finds out that you
helped your girlfriend kill herself...

385
00:26:41,784 --> 00:26:43,274
and she divorces you.

386
00:26:43,353 --> 00:26:44,650
She won't find out.

387
00:26:44,721 --> 00:26:47,246
-I'm not killing anybody.
-Fine.

388
00:26:47,624 --> 00:26:49,956
We don't have to talk about it.

389
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:53,024
You just concentrate on your work, dear.

390
00:26:53,830 --> 00:26:56,492
-I'm gonna lift the brow now.
-Love it!

391
00:26:56,666 --> 00:26:58,133
Lift away!

392
00:27:02,539 --> 00:27:03,597
Cancer?

393
00:27:03,673 --> 00:27:05,732
Like Megan's? No, darling.

394
00:27:06,809 --> 00:27:09,004
I got this from the vomiting.

395
00:27:09,546 --> 00:27:12,606
When I got so bored with my life
I decided to end it all.

396
00:27:12,682 --> 00:27:15,207
I gathered up
all of mother's little helpers...

397
00:27:15,285 --> 00:27:18,413
and washed them down
with a tumbler of martinis.

398
00:27:18,721 --> 00:27:21,485
But what they don't tell you
is that pills and alcohol...

399
00:27:21,558 --> 00:27:25,016
almost always cause you
to retch uncontrollably.

400
00:27:26,763 --> 00:27:28,890
My throat just got ruined.

401
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:33,061
-Help Megan, Sean.
-No.

402
00:27:33,336 --> 00:27:37,466
Give her a nice glass of cold milk
to coat her stomach...

403
00:27:37,774 --> 00:27:41,642
so she won't humiliate herself
like she did in the restaurant.

404
00:27:41,744 --> 00:27:44,110
-And don't forget the plastic bag.
-No.

405
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:47,547
It's a necessary evil
when you're committing suicide.

406
00:27:48,518 --> 00:27:53,353
Pills and alcohoI alone
are an insufferably long, slow death.

407
00:27:53,990 --> 00:27:57,824
But with a bag over your head
after you've taken the pills....

408
00:27:59,429 --> 00:28:00,657
Heaven!

409
00:28:01,965 --> 00:28:05,264
The lack of oxygen makes you see colors.

410
00:28:06,336 --> 00:28:09,271
Just beautiful, glorious...

411
00:28:09,339 --> 00:28:11,569
vibrant colors.

412
00:28:13,276 --> 00:28:15,744
And you go off so peacefully...

413
00:28:16,579 --> 00:28:18,604
like you were in a dream.

414
00:28:19,315 --> 00:28:21,875
That's what you have to do. Bag her.

415
00:28:25,188 --> 00:28:26,314
Time.

416
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:25,769
Goodbye, Scarecrow.

417
00:30:27,310 --> 00:30:29,608
I'm going to miss you most of all.

418
00:30:40,790 --> 00:30:42,280
Do me a favor.

419
00:30:42,859 --> 00:30:44,121
Anything.

420
00:30:44,193 --> 00:30:47,492
Remember the beginning
and middle of me with you.

421
00:30:48,297 --> 00:30:49,696
Not the end.

422
00:30:57,039 --> 00:30:58,404
Thank you.

423
00:31:37,013 --> 00:31:39,140
I'm gonna put it on now.

424
00:33:12,241 --> 00:33:14,471
-What did she die of?
-Cancer.

425
00:33:16,078 --> 00:33:18,103
Did the implants bring it on again or--

426
00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:20,546
Statistically, the odds are low.

427
00:33:20,783 --> 00:33:22,307
You never know.

428
00:33:23,352 --> 00:33:25,513
I informed her of the risks.

429
00:33:29,926 --> 00:33:31,951
Was her husband with her?

430
00:33:32,028 --> 00:33:33,791
They were separated.

431
00:33:37,667 --> 00:33:39,157
I don't know.

432
00:33:40,970 --> 00:33:42,995
Your suit's been pressed.

433
00:33:43,072 --> 00:33:45,870
I'll pick up your shirt
from the dry cleaner's.

434
00:33:45,942 --> 00:33:47,170
Thanks.

435
00:33:53,449 --> 00:33:55,508
l'd like to come with you.

436
00:33:56,586 --> 00:33:58,076
You didn't know her.

437
00:33:58,154 --> 00:33:59,382
You did.

438
00:34:00,690 --> 00:34:03,989
And you're obviously very affected
by this patient.

439
00:34:05,761 --> 00:34:07,729
And I wanna support you.

440
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:12,932
You're not responsible, Sean,
statistics or not.

441
00:34:13,536 --> 00:34:15,731
I'll clear my afternoon tomorrow.

442
00:34:15,805 --> 00:34:18,035
I don't want you to go alone.

443
00:34:39,128 --> 00:34:41,289
Very nice, Dr. Troy. Pass.

444
00:34:50,373 --> 00:34:51,931
Tick-tock, Sean.

445
00:34:52,308 --> 00:34:54,538
When your time's up, it's up.

446
00:34:55,378 --> 00:34:57,141
Me, Megan.

447
00:34:57,346 --> 00:34:59,507
Don't flunk out, boy wonder.

448
00:34:59,682 --> 00:35:01,377
Be quiet. I have to concentrate.

449
00:35:01,450 --> 00:35:04,476
You got rid of Megan's pain.
Now what about yours?

450
00:35:04,553 --> 00:35:05,542
Please.

451
00:35:05,621 --> 00:35:08,317
What about your relationship
with your wife?

452
00:35:08,391 --> 00:35:10,484
She's coming to the funeral.

453
00:35:10,559 --> 00:35:11,856
You couldn't say no.

454
00:35:11,927 --> 00:35:14,623
She might suspect something if you did.

455
00:35:14,697 --> 00:35:16,597
lsn't that just a pip?

456
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:21,599
And aren't you just so weak...

457
00:35:21,971 --> 00:35:23,233
for lying?

458
00:35:23,305 --> 00:35:24,465
You're cruel.

459
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:26,701
I'm only telling you
what you already know.

460
00:35:26,776 --> 00:35:28,403
But let's be honest, shall we?

461
00:35:28,477 --> 00:35:30,502
Yeah, sure, I know you're sad...

462
00:35:30,579 --> 00:35:34,879
but aren't you just also a little bit happy?

463
00:35:35,084 --> 00:35:37,450
I'll sew your mouth shut, I swear to God.

464
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:40,614
Aren't you just a little bit thrilled...

465
00:35:40,690 --> 00:35:42,317
you got away with it?

466
00:35:42,391 --> 00:35:43,551
I didn't kill her.

467
00:35:43,626 --> 00:35:45,856
You got away with the affair.

468
00:35:46,195 --> 00:35:49,130
She was right
when she called you Scarecrow.

469
00:35:49,665 --> 00:35:51,326
You need a brain.

470
00:35:51,701 --> 00:35:53,134
Correct me if I'm wrong...

471
00:35:53,202 --> 00:35:55,432
but you could have
your medicaI license revoked...

472
00:35:55,504 --> 00:35:57,472
if someone saw you
at the scene of the crime.

473
00:35:57,540 --> 00:36:00,065
No one saw me. Housekeeping
found her body this morning.

474
00:36:00,142 --> 00:36:01,473
Of course.

475
00:36:01,544 --> 00:36:05,708
All those moving letters,
so no questions asked.

476
00:36:05,781 --> 00:36:07,749
She was sick. It was her time.

477
00:36:07,817 --> 00:36:11,275
And now, conveniently,
your wife doesn't have to know.

478
00:36:11,787 --> 00:36:13,687
-I love it.
-You shut up.

479
00:36:13,756 --> 00:36:16,623
-There's no trace of an affair.
-I said shut up!

480
00:36:16,692 --> 00:36:18,489
But the irony of it.

481
00:36:18,561 --> 00:36:20,893
lnstead of helping to mask your pain...

482
00:36:20,963 --> 00:36:24,558
the affair with Megan O'Hara
only made it worse.

483
00:36:24,667 --> 00:36:28,159
Ain't life a goddamn kick in the pants?

484
00:36:28,237 --> 00:36:29,465
Shut up!

485
00:36:43,652 --> 00:36:45,313
-Sean!
-Leave me alone.

486
00:36:47,256 --> 00:36:49,588
-What the hell happened in there?
-She's dead!

487
00:36:49,658 --> 00:36:51,649
-I would hope so!
-Megan.

488
00:36:52,394 --> 00:36:54,123
She killed herself.

489
00:36:55,197 --> 00:36:56,721
We were having an affair...

490
00:36:56,799 --> 00:36:59,734
the cancer came back,
and she took her life.

491
00:37:02,271 --> 00:37:04,364
-It's going to be okay.
-No, it's not.

492
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:05,873
Don't you get it?

493
00:37:05,941 --> 00:37:08,569
You're not the failure, Christian. I am.

494
00:37:08,644 --> 00:37:10,578
I'm the one who lied and cheated.

495
00:37:10,646 --> 00:37:12,614
I'm the one who let her die!

496
00:37:13,816 --> 00:37:16,444
I should have been strong, but I'm weak.

497
00:37:17,086 --> 00:37:18,519
You can't just leave.

498
00:37:18,587 --> 00:37:20,680
You have to go back in there
and take the test!

499
00:37:20,756 --> 00:37:22,951
Screw the test! I don't care!

500
00:37:23,092 --> 00:37:24,582
I don't care about anything.

501
00:37:30,633 --> 00:37:31,964
My wife...

502
00:37:32,434 --> 00:37:34,425
was crazy.

503
00:37:36,005 --> 00:37:37,939
That's why I loved her.

504
00:37:38,674 --> 00:37:42,110
She pushed me to try things
I was afraid of.

505
00:37:42,778 --> 00:37:44,405
She had no fear.

506
00:37:45,481 --> 00:37:48,382
On my first date with Megan,
she picked me up...

507
00:37:48,450 --> 00:37:52,477
in her ugly lime-green MG
and told me we were going hang-gliding.

508
00:37:52,755 --> 00:37:54,814
I thought she was kidding.

509
00:37:55,324 --> 00:37:56,723
She wasn't.

510
00:37:58,527 --> 00:38:01,826
I never won a single game of Scrabble
with my wife.

511
00:38:02,431 --> 00:38:05,264
She taught me the difference
between a pawpaw...

512
00:38:05,334 --> 00:38:06,824
and a butterfly weed.

513
00:38:06,902 --> 00:38:08,426
On our chalkboard in the kitchen...

514
00:38:08,504 --> 00:38:11,371
every day she wrote a new word...

515
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:13,499
she thought I should know.

516
00:38:15,211 --> 00:38:17,338
She forced me to be better.

517
00:38:18,848 --> 00:38:21,009
That's what marriage is.

518
00:38:22,551 --> 00:38:24,451
For better, for worse.

519
00:38:29,225 --> 00:38:31,125
Megan, you cheated me.

520
00:38:32,728 --> 00:38:35,856
You promised me for better,
for worse, remember?

521
00:38:36,465 --> 00:38:39,366
I deserved to go through
the worst with you.

522
00:38:40,669 --> 00:38:43,160
I wanted to. It was my place.

523
00:38:46,909 --> 00:38:48,274
It's okay.

524
00:39:01,590 --> 00:39:04,889
Megan asked that her ashes
be scattered into the ocean.

525
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:07,690
That way her spirit could be forever free.

526
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:14,595
She wanted those she loved
to help release a part of her.

527
00:39:15,004 --> 00:39:16,995
We'd like to do that now.

528
00:41:25,034 --> 00:41:27,434
I'm gonna make some coffee.
You want some?

529
00:41:27,503 --> 00:41:28,868
No, thanks.

530
00:41:28,937 --> 00:41:31,098
Do you want me to order out?

531
00:41:31,206 --> 00:41:33,003
I'm not that hungry.

532
00:41:34,276 --> 00:41:36,642
Did you have an affair with her?

533
00:41:39,181 --> 00:41:40,239
Yes.

534
00:41:59,601 --> 00:42:01,728
Please don't touch me.

535
00:42:09,845 --> 00:42:11,506
When did it start?

536
00:42:11,580 --> 00:42:13,548
After you lost the baby.

537
00:42:13,982 --> 00:42:17,179
Right around the time
you started sleeping with Jude.

538
00:42:18,253 --> 00:42:20,016
I didn't sleep with Jude.

539
00:42:20,089 --> 00:42:23,115
Julia, don't embarrass yourself with a lie.

540
00:42:23,192 --> 00:42:24,819
Like you have for months?

541
00:42:24,893 --> 00:42:27,885
I found the picture in your book.

542
00:42:27,963 --> 00:42:30,193
-You went through my things?
-Yes.

543
00:42:30,265 --> 00:42:35,066
And I found the half-naked picture of a boy
only a few years older than your son.

544
00:42:35,270 --> 00:42:38,569
And in that second,
I hated you for what you'd done.

545
00:42:40,642 --> 00:42:42,041
And I knew.

546
00:42:44,213 --> 00:42:47,239
Then I turned to someone
who could comfort me.

547
00:42:48,417 --> 00:42:49,816
And she did.

548
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:53,020
I didn't sleep with him.

549
00:42:53,088 --> 00:42:54,680
That's not true. I know--

550
00:42:54,756 --> 00:42:57,054
Was I tempted? Did I want to?

551
00:42:57,126 --> 00:42:59,458
Yes, I did, I'm ashamed to say.

552
00:43:01,263 --> 00:43:03,231
But I always wanted you more.

553
00:43:03,899 --> 00:43:06,493
So when it came to it, I did nothing.

554
00:43:21,283 --> 00:43:23,183
Did you love her?

555
00:43:28,891 --> 00:43:29,983
Yes.

556
00:43:32,561 --> 00:43:34,461
Do you love me anymore?

557
00:43:35,931 --> 00:43:37,091
More than you'll ever know.

558
00:43:37,166 --> 00:43:39,896
God! And this is how you show it, Sean?

559
00:43:40,702 --> 00:43:44,832
This is how you reward
my patience and my fidelity...

560
00:43:44,907 --> 00:43:47,467
and the sanctity of our children
and our marriage...

561
00:43:47,543 --> 00:43:49,602
by screwing another woman?

562
00:43:49,912 --> 00:43:53,678
God! Even your infidelity
is passive-aggressive.

563
00:43:55,551 --> 00:43:58,213
-How's that?
-Because she's dead, Sean.

564
00:44:00,289 --> 00:44:02,553
And she died a horrible death.

565
00:44:02,624 --> 00:44:06,025
And I can't hate a woman
who died of cancer at 36.

566
00:44:08,931 --> 00:44:10,125
Hit me.

567
00:44:10,666 --> 00:44:13,328
You want to. Do it. I deserve it!

568
00:44:13,402 --> 00:44:15,461
There's not a cup handy. Just hit me!

569
00:44:15,537 --> 00:44:18,665
I don't have the energy to hit you, Sean.

570
00:44:19,641 --> 00:44:21,268
Or to hate you...

571
00:44:21,843 --> 00:44:23,777
or to love you anymore.

572
00:44:24,680 --> 00:44:27,513
But you owe me this.
It's all I want to know.

573
00:44:30,652 --> 00:44:33,314
What did she give you that I couldn't?

574
00:44:36,892 --> 00:44:39,122
She saw the good in me, Julia.

575
00:44:41,063 --> 00:44:44,328
She saw the potential, the hope.

576
00:44:46,802 --> 00:44:48,963
Every time you look at me...

577
00:44:49,338 --> 00:44:51,203
I see it in your eyes.

578
00:44:51,373 --> 00:44:53,705
All I see staring back at me...

579
00:44:53,942 --> 00:44:55,273
is regret.

580
00:44:56,812 --> 00:44:58,439
lsn't that true?

581
00:44:59,381 --> 00:45:00,507
Yes.

582
00:45:01,650 --> 00:45:03,208
For both of us.

583
00:45:08,457 --> 00:45:10,357
We were so happy, Sean.

584
00:45:12,261 --> 00:45:14,525
We could do anything together.

585
00:45:16,999 --> 00:45:19,126
The night we got married...

586
00:45:20,102 --> 00:45:21,763
I couldn't sleep.

587
00:45:22,070 --> 00:45:24,163
All I did was stare at you.

588
00:45:25,674 --> 00:45:27,733
I was so in love with you.

589
00:45:29,144 --> 00:45:31,169
It was so full of promise.

590
00:45:34,349 --> 00:45:37,341
And now it's all gone,
and it's all turned to ash...

591
00:45:37,419 --> 00:45:39,046
just like Megan.

592
00:45:41,156 --> 00:45:43,056
And it breaks my heart.

593
00:45:47,429 --> 00:45:49,659
I can't lose you, too, Julia.

594
00:45:57,406 --> 00:46:00,239
We lost each other a long time ago, Sean.

595
00:46:16,758 --> 00:46:18,248
I'm so sorry.

596
00:47:03,505 --> 00:47:04,494
