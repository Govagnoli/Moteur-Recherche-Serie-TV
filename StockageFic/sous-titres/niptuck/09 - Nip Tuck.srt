1
00:00:13,225 --> 00:00:17,753
Here at Bare, Dr. Troy, we offer our clients
a wide range of full-body treatments.

2
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:22,360
lsn't that funny? l've found myself
saying the same thing on occasion.

3
00:00:22,935 --> 00:00:27,304
Or l could arrange to work
on a specific area of your body...

4
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:29,705
if that's what you'd like.

5
00:00:31,010 --> 00:00:32,409
Hey, honey.

6
00:00:34,013 --> 00:00:35,878
Don't you just love this place?

7
00:00:35,948 --> 00:00:38,849
Yes. l was just going over my options.

8
00:00:39,218 --> 00:00:43,211
l already took care of that. l called ahead
for the dual hot stone massages.

9
00:00:43,289 --> 00:00:44,950
lt should be under ''Troy.''

10
00:00:45,024 --> 00:00:47,151
Dual, as in we share the same room?

11
00:00:47,226 --> 00:00:51,287
lt's our three-month anniversary, honey.
l thought you'd wanna be together.

12
00:00:52,798 --> 00:00:55,164
l have another surprise for you.

13
00:01:14,987 --> 00:01:18,388
-What the hell is that?
-They waxed in your initials, see?

14
00:01:20,793 --> 00:01:25,457
K.T.? Sweetheart, it's Christian
with a ''C,'' not a ''K.''

15
00:01:26,332 --> 00:01:27,526
Really?

16
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:30,491
Has it always been that way?

17
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:34,200
So, this must be the better half.

18
00:01:34,807 --> 00:01:37,173
l never knew Christian had such taste.

19
00:01:37,242 --> 00:01:40,302
Merrill Bobolit, M.D. lt's a pleasure.

20
00:01:40,579 --> 00:01:42,012
Kimber Henry. Hello.

21
00:01:42,081 --> 00:01:45,676
You metro-sexual, you. What're
you doing here, getting your back waxed?

22
00:01:45,751 --> 00:01:46,809
Who told you?

23
00:01:46,885 --> 00:01:50,184
Baby, l'm gonna go see
if they can fix my ''K,'' okay?

24
00:01:53,425 --> 00:01:54,483
Okay.

25
00:01:55,661 --> 00:01:56,855
Wow!

26
00:01:57,529 --> 00:02:00,623
l'm betting that one
tastes like Golden Grahams.

27
00:02:00,733 --> 00:02:03,964
l really do hate to see
two beautiful people in love.

28
00:02:04,169 --> 00:02:08,469
Love, please. lf she wasn't the best sex
of my life, she'd be long gone by now.

29
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:10,701
She's just not bright enough to realize it.

30
00:02:10,776 --> 00:02:13,904
Good in bed, not too bright?
Oh, my God, she's my dream woman.

31
00:02:13,979 --> 00:02:17,938
She should be mine. She's beautiful,
doting, everything a guy should want.

32
00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:21,850
But if l wanted to do the high
maintenance thing, l'd get a '66 Fiat.

33
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,888
When are you gonna dump her?

34
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:27,218
Merrill, you trying
to move in on my girlfriend?

35
00:02:27,292 --> 00:02:30,659
When there's a towel on a chaise,
that means it's spoken for.

36
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:32,054
Up!

37
00:02:34,066 --> 00:02:35,226
Jesus.

38
00:02:37,002 --> 00:02:41,666
As l was saying, Kimber Henry would be
the perfect mother for my children.

39
00:02:41,807 --> 00:02:45,072
My DNA mixed with hers
all but assures a blond Jew.

40
00:02:46,445 --> 00:02:48,879
-Wanna make a trade?
-Trade for what?

41
00:02:48,947 --> 00:02:51,916
For Kimber. You remember Monica, right?

42
00:02:51,984 --> 00:02:55,181
You met her at my house.
l'll fix you up with her and her friend.

43
00:02:55,254 --> 00:02:57,381
A two-for-one. How about it?

44
00:02:58,424 --> 00:03:01,587
You're out of your league, Merrill.
You got nothing l want.

45
00:03:03,529 --> 00:03:06,828
Yes, l do. My car. Remember?

46
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:12,192
You're telling me
you'd trade your Lamborghini for Kimber?

47
00:03:12,938 --> 00:03:15,236
-You're insane.
-Yeah, you're right.

48
00:03:15,307 --> 00:03:18,174
She'll be back on the market soon.
l'll scoop her up then.

49
00:03:18,243 --> 00:03:21,144
Excuse me for trying to allow
a painless breakup for you.

50
00:03:21,213 --> 00:03:23,340
You're honestly prepared
to give me the car?

51
00:03:23,415 --> 00:03:26,976
You know how l operate, Christian.
l see something l like, l go for it.

52
00:03:27,052 --> 00:03:29,885
lt's the curse of being rich and impatient.

53
00:03:30,289 --> 00:03:32,416
Excuse me. Dr. Troy...

54
00:03:32,858 --> 00:03:35,418
your girlfriend wanted me
to double-check with you.

55
00:03:35,494 --> 00:03:38,258
That was a ''C'' and not a ''K,'' right?

56
00:03:43,302 --> 00:03:45,896
Merrill, l think we can work
something out.

57
00:04:40,559 --> 00:04:42,754
Are you sure it's calibrated right?

58
00:04:42,828 --> 00:04:45,262
l know. lt's an evil, evil device.

59
00:04:45,898 --> 00:04:48,492
But watch how it works. 140.

60
00:04:49,401 --> 00:04:50,834
You sure about that?

61
00:04:50,903 --> 00:04:54,964
lf she's gonna be a real woman,
she needs to start lying about her weight.

62
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,975
-l'm only trying to be helpful.
-l like her.

63
00:04:59,178 --> 00:05:02,477
Sophia, l need your signature
on this patient-consent form.

64
00:05:02,548 --> 00:05:04,345
l already signed one of those...

65
00:05:04,416 --> 00:05:07,283
after you fixed my Adam's apple
and before you did my breasts.

66
00:05:07,352 --> 00:05:11,311
The sexual reassignment surgery
has more risks. lnfections are possible.

67
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:14,359
On average, there's a 15°% chance
of hemorrhaging, which can--

68
00:05:14,426 --> 00:05:16,485
l could actually die from this?

69
00:05:18,297 --> 00:05:19,355
Yes.

70
00:05:20,165 --> 00:05:24,226
By law, l have to have you sign
a form specifically for the S.R.S.

71
00:05:24,436 --> 00:05:26,734
Okay. Sure.

72
00:05:38,450 --> 00:05:41,886
Do you need
the gender reassignment surgery, Sophia?

73
00:05:42,287 --> 00:05:45,222
Can't you just keep the breasts
and the Kibbles 'n Bits...

74
00:05:45,290 --> 00:05:49,158
and be satisfied with the knowledge
that emotionally and spiritually...

75
00:05:49,228 --> 00:05:51,662
you are more of a woman than most?

76
00:05:53,432 --> 00:05:56,924
That trade-off works for many
in the transgender community...

77
00:05:57,803 --> 00:05:59,828
but l wanna feel complete.

78
00:06:00,205 --> 00:06:03,333
Honestly, Liz, l'm more concerned
about my expanding fat ass...

79
00:06:03,408 --> 00:06:06,206
than l am about
turning my penis into a vagina.

80
00:06:06,678 --> 00:06:10,444
Gaining a few pounds before
your bottom surgery is normal, Sophia.

81
00:06:10,515 --> 00:06:14,144
Being off the estrogen is what causes it.
Nothing to worry about.

82
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,987
When you're in my situation,
that's when you need to worry.

83
00:06:18,056 --> 00:06:19,887
What situation is that, Liz?

84
00:06:19,958 --> 00:06:21,926
Forty. Single. Picky.

85
00:06:22,661 --> 00:06:25,562
Liz, you're dating again? Good for you.

86
00:06:26,999 --> 00:06:30,935
Going to bars and being rejected
is not something l consider dating.

87
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:35,499
l'm thinking about starting
an employee discount on Botox.

88
00:06:36,541 --> 00:06:38,566
Not that you would need it, Liz.

89
00:06:38,644 --> 00:06:42,603
You're right, Dr. McNamara,
she doesn't need it. Turn to me, Liz.

90
00:06:46,752 --> 00:06:51,155
You got a beautiful canvas.
You just need to throw some paint on it.

91
00:06:51,657 --> 00:06:55,024
A little concealer under the eyes,
a couple of shades of foundation...

92
00:06:55,093 --> 00:06:59,393
and guess what? You'll look like
a 25-year-old lipstick lesbian.

93
00:06:59,965 --> 00:07:02,160
You must know a lot about makeup.

94
00:07:02,334 --> 00:07:04,962
l've had to conceal a lot in my life.

95
00:07:06,204 --> 00:07:07,728
On every level.

96
00:07:10,342 --> 00:07:11,969
My place tonight?

97
00:07:12,277 --> 00:07:17,146
You bring the wine and l'll prove to you
you don't need a scalpel to turn back time.

98
00:07:22,421 --> 00:07:25,584
You ready to do some homework?
Let's see....

99
00:07:27,459 --> 00:07:30,292
We start with advanced calculus.

100
00:07:31,096 --> 00:07:33,121
No, l agree. Too boring.

101
00:07:38,203 --> 00:07:39,397
French?

102
00:07:40,505 --> 00:07:42,200
Okay, sure.

103
00:07:43,308 --> 00:07:45,105
French it is.

104
00:07:57,522 --> 00:07:59,012
Cara just....

105
00:08:00,192 --> 00:08:02,922
Matt, l'm with a patient.
You need to knock.

106
00:08:02,994 --> 00:08:04,791
lt's Cara. She moved.

107
00:08:04,930 --> 00:08:06,557
-Moved?
-Twitched.

108
00:08:07,632 --> 00:08:11,625
This is a good sign. Let me finish
my exam, and we'll talk later.

109
00:08:17,976 --> 00:08:19,068
Shit.

110
00:08:21,747 --> 00:08:24,147
You weren't doing anything
out of line, Sean.

111
00:08:24,216 --> 00:08:27,151
l was due for an exam.
You were giving it to me.

112
00:08:27,219 --> 00:08:29,414
That's not all we were doing.

113
00:08:33,325 --> 00:08:35,350
We can't do this anymore.

114
00:08:37,596 --> 00:08:38,756
l agree.

115
00:08:39,731 --> 00:08:41,221
l meant here.

116
00:08:45,303 --> 00:08:46,964
-Phase one.
-Trust.

117
00:08:49,408 --> 00:08:50,773
Hey, baby!

118
00:08:53,011 --> 00:08:55,343
You didn't say
you were bringing company.

119
00:08:55,414 --> 00:08:58,679
Sorry, sweetheart.
You remember Merrill, right?

120
00:08:59,151 --> 00:09:00,379
-Hi.
-Hello.

121
00:09:08,727 --> 00:09:09,955
Thank you.

122
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,729
What are you doing?

123
00:09:17,302 --> 00:09:19,827
We're gonna watch Pay-Per-View tonight.

124
00:09:22,174 --> 00:09:24,108
ls that the dress l hate?

125
00:09:24,409 --> 00:09:26,468
You never said you hated this dress.

126
00:09:26,545 --> 00:09:29,946
lt makes you look boxy.
Why are you wearing it?

127
00:09:34,286 --> 00:09:37,414
l thought we had plans
to go to the Conga Room tonight.

128
00:09:37,489 --> 00:09:39,480
Sorry, sweetheart. Slipped my mind.

129
00:09:39,558 --> 00:09:41,719
l invited some friends to watch the fight.

130
00:09:41,793 --> 00:09:43,852
You probably don't wanna stay for that.

131
00:09:43,929 --> 00:09:47,695
l can't figure out this DlRECTV thing.
You see if you can make that work.

132
00:09:47,766 --> 00:09:49,529
l'm gonna go change.

133
00:09:58,510 --> 00:10:01,240
Can't believe he talks to you like that.

134
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:03,812
He probably just had a hard day.

135
00:10:03,915 --> 00:10:07,043
Hey, if my gorgeous girlfriend
puts on a dress like that...

136
00:10:07,118 --> 00:10:09,382
l don't care what kind of day l've had,
l'm happy.

137
00:10:09,454 --> 00:10:11,752
And l don't break dinner plans.

138
00:10:12,724 --> 00:10:14,817
l'm sorry. l'm not helping.

139
00:10:15,627 --> 00:10:19,222
lf you wanted to talk about it,
you'd call a girlfriend or something.

140
00:10:20,198 --> 00:10:22,826
l don't really have many friends here.

141
00:10:23,068 --> 00:10:27,698
Don't feel bad. l told him, ''She's the most
beautiful woman in the world.

142
00:10:27,772 --> 00:10:29,672
''She's not an 8. She's a 15! ''

143
00:10:32,077 --> 00:10:34,068
He still thinks l'm an 8?

144
00:10:36,748 --> 00:10:38,306
But l did the surgery.

145
00:10:41,019 --> 00:10:44,045
l don't wanna sound forward, but...

146
00:10:46,291 --> 00:10:48,418
here, take my business card.

147
00:10:54,633 --> 00:10:57,033
-You think l need more work done?
-No.

148
00:10:57,602 --> 00:11:00,628
l want you to have somebody to call
when he's being a dick.

149
00:11:00,705 --> 00:11:03,902
And if you feel the need
to unload on somebody....

150
00:11:11,249 --> 00:11:13,774
-Okay. You gonna watch the fight?
-No.

151
00:11:16,454 --> 00:11:19,617
l think l'm gonna go for a walk
and get some air.

152
00:11:19,991 --> 00:11:21,151
Great.

153
00:11:34,973 --> 00:11:37,441
-How'd it go?
-Phase one, complete.

154
00:11:47,419 --> 00:11:49,887
-How do l look?
-More feminine.

155
00:11:50,488 --> 00:11:52,615
Okay, behold.

156
00:11:54,426 --> 00:11:55,950
l look straight.

157
00:11:56,494 --> 00:12:00,021
l'm sorry. They don't make a lipstick shade
called ''bull dyke.''

158
00:12:00,098 --> 00:12:02,328
Can't l look more me?

159
00:12:04,402 --> 00:12:05,391
Okay.

160
00:12:08,239 --> 00:12:11,333
But l must say,
l'm a little disappointed, Liz.

161
00:12:11,543 --> 00:12:13,602
Because l don't wanna look like a clown?

162
00:12:13,678 --> 00:12:18,172
Because you of all people should know
that a facade does not determine a person.

163
00:12:18,717 --> 00:12:21,379
Why get a sexual reassignment surgery?

164
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:24,889
Because my facade is hiding my person.

165
00:12:25,890 --> 00:12:28,586
l'm not trying to be a beautiful woman.

166
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:31,092
l know l'm no Salma Hayek, okay?

167
00:12:32,097 --> 00:12:35,931
l'm just trying to get rid of the man
on the outside as much as l can...

168
00:12:36,001 --> 00:12:38,492
so l somewhat can reflect what l am:

169
00:12:39,004 --> 00:12:40,232
a woman.

170
00:12:42,407 --> 00:12:44,705
Have you always been a lesbian, Liz?

171
00:12:44,776 --> 00:12:47,267
l slept with a man once in college.

172
00:12:47,646 --> 00:12:48,670
But he had long hair...

173
00:12:48,747 --> 00:12:52,080
and when l closed my eyes
and felt it sweeping across my face...

174
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:54,448
l pretended he was Joni Mitchell.

175
00:12:56,588 --> 00:12:58,647
What about you? You gay?

176
00:12:58,990 --> 00:13:00,787
-Today.
-And tomorrow?

177
00:13:01,426 --> 00:13:04,156
Straight. After the surgery.

178
00:13:04,629 --> 00:13:07,962
You're a conundrum
wrapped up in a riddle, babe.

179
00:13:12,303 --> 00:13:14,134
You look beautiful.

180
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,264
l do?

181
00:13:16,775 --> 00:13:20,506
l'm sorry. l pluck too many hairs?
lt hurts, l know.

182
00:13:20,578 --> 00:13:22,011
No, it's not that.

183
00:13:22,714 --> 00:13:24,306
l'm just so sad.

184
00:13:24,983 --> 00:13:26,041
Why?

185
00:13:31,156 --> 00:13:33,147
l just wanna love someone.

186
00:13:33,525 --> 00:13:35,755
And l want someone to love me back.

187
00:13:36,561 --> 00:13:38,620
And now l go to the bars and...

188
00:13:38,697 --> 00:13:41,757
l used to get looks back
when l was younger, you know?

189
00:13:41,833 --> 00:13:44,597
And now, l'm invisible.

190
00:13:44,669 --> 00:13:48,400
lt's like the whole culture
is geared toward 25-year-olds...

191
00:13:50,508 --> 00:13:52,305
and that's not me anymore.

192
00:13:54,012 --> 00:13:56,003
l know how you feel, Liz.

193
00:13:57,015 --> 00:13:58,539
l'm lonely, too.

194
00:13:59,384 --> 00:14:02,581
l feel like you do,
maybe the parade passed me by.

195
00:14:03,455 --> 00:14:06,686
l mean, l had trouble
getting men when l was a man.

196
00:14:07,392 --> 00:14:09,121
Didn't have any muscles.

197
00:14:09,594 --> 00:14:12,586
l was a fem,
which the boys hate these days.

198
00:14:13,364 --> 00:14:15,298
And now l wanna be a woman...

199
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:17,024
who, let's face it...

200
00:14:17,836 --> 00:14:19,531
still resembles a man.

201
00:14:20,872 --> 00:14:22,396
And l wonder...

202
00:14:25,777 --> 00:14:27,574
who's gonna want me now?

203
00:14:28,646 --> 00:14:30,443
Who'll see beyond...

204
00:14:32,083 --> 00:14:36,179
the makeup and the surgeries
and see the person who's inside?

205
00:14:36,588 --> 00:14:39,148
Shit. This isn't waterproof.

206
00:14:40,158 --> 00:14:43,525
This is the worst girls' night out
l ever had.

207
00:14:44,629 --> 00:14:45,687
Me, too.

208
00:14:47,632 --> 00:14:50,692
And yet, it's kind of the best.

209
00:14:56,407 --> 00:14:59,240
l see the person inside you, Sophia.

210
00:15:01,146 --> 00:15:02,477
Right now.

211
00:15:03,114 --> 00:15:04,376
l see you.

212
00:15:05,483 --> 00:15:07,246
l see you, too, Liz.

213
00:15:21,833 --> 00:15:23,164
Eight...

214
00:15:27,005 --> 00:15:28,302
nine....

215
00:15:32,977 --> 00:15:35,969
-Okay, come on. Last one.
-l can't.

216
00:15:36,047 --> 00:15:37,173
You gotta.

217
00:15:41,953 --> 00:15:45,855
Do all the other women you work with
need as much help as l do?

218
00:15:46,357 --> 00:15:48,154
You're kidding me, right?

219
00:15:48,993 --> 00:15:51,894
l wish all my class trained as hard as you.

220
00:15:52,931 --> 00:15:55,422
Okay, we're not finished yet. Over here.

221
00:15:57,202 --> 00:15:58,669
On your back.

222
00:16:01,105 --> 00:16:02,402
Leg up.

223
00:16:04,776 --> 00:16:07,404
-What are we doing now?
-Do you trust me?

224
00:16:18,223 --> 00:16:20,691
<i>Julia. Quelle surprise.</i>

225
00:16:20,758 --> 00:16:21,986
Suzanne!

226
00:16:23,895 --> 00:16:25,089
Hi.

227
00:16:25,964 --> 00:16:28,194
Jude, working hard today, are we?

228
00:16:28,266 --> 00:16:29,893
You two know each other?

229
00:16:29,968 --> 00:16:32,903
Yes, l trained a friend of Suzanne's
a few months ago.

230
00:16:32,971 --> 00:16:35,701
l think we're almost done.
Five minutes on the cardio.

231
00:16:35,773 --> 00:16:37,741
-Fancy a smoothie?
-Sure.

232
00:16:37,809 --> 00:16:39,071
My treat.

233
00:16:47,852 --> 00:16:50,946
How much for Jude?
Are you paying retail, honey?

234
00:16:51,189 --> 00:16:54,556
Hell, even if you are,
apparently he's worth the money.

235
00:16:55,093 --> 00:16:57,288
Yeah. He works me out hard.

236
00:16:58,730 --> 00:17:02,097
Oh, my God.
You really don't know, do you?

237
00:17:02,433 --> 00:17:03,798
Know what?

238
00:17:05,370 --> 00:17:08,897
Sweetheart, he's not
a real personal trainer.

239
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:11,838
That's only how he meets his real clients.

240
00:17:13,144 --> 00:17:14,771
For sex, sweetie.

241
00:17:15,947 --> 00:17:17,915
Don't be shocked. Enjoy.

242
00:17:18,816 --> 00:17:20,977
You paid him to have sex with you?

243
00:17:21,052 --> 00:17:24,715
No, not me, because l do not have
the morals of an alley cat.

244
00:17:24,856 --> 00:17:27,450
But a lot of the women
in my spinning class have...

245
00:17:27,525 --> 00:17:32,394
and the word is, once Jude puts you
through his bedroom calisthenics...

246
00:17:32,864 --> 00:17:34,695
you feel the burn for days.

247
00:17:34,766 --> 00:17:37,462
That is not true. Jude is a student--

248
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:39,867
How do you think
he affords those clothes?

249
00:17:39,938 --> 00:17:41,667
And that apartment?

250
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:44,574
Not by working at Subway, sweetie.

251
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:08,220
Hi.

252
00:18:08,833 --> 00:18:09,822
Hi.

253
00:18:11,436 --> 00:18:13,996
Look, l don't know how
this is gonna sound...

254
00:18:14,072 --> 00:18:18,338
seeing in five minutes your scrotum
is gonna be turned into a labia majora.

255
00:18:21,879 --> 00:18:23,471
But last night....

256
00:18:23,715 --> 00:18:25,478
Was incredible.

257
00:18:26,084 --> 00:18:30,453
-You thought so, too?
-l can't stop thinking about it.

258
00:18:30,588 --> 00:18:31,953
Me neither.

259
00:18:32,724 --> 00:18:35,215
lt's the first time in a long time that l felt--

260
00:18:35,293 --> 00:18:36,658
Connected?

261
00:18:38,196 --> 00:18:39,185
Yeah.

262
00:18:44,402 --> 00:18:47,894
What do you think that would be like,
to want to get rid of your penis...

263
00:18:47,972 --> 00:18:50,270
the hub of all power? Can you imagine?

264
00:18:50,975 --> 00:18:53,409
Actually, l admire her conviction.

265
00:18:53,578 --> 00:18:55,341
-lt takes....
-Balls?

266
00:19:01,719 --> 00:19:04,882
-What's going on in here?
-She doesn't wanna have the operation.

267
00:19:04,956 --> 00:19:06,218
-What?
-Sophia, why?

268
00:19:06,290 --> 00:19:08,315
l'm sorry, Dr. McNamara...

269
00:19:08,393 --> 00:19:13,353
but l'm having a sexual identity
and a sexual preference crisis.

270
00:19:13,698 --> 00:19:16,223
-l'm a wreck.
-Sophia, what happened?

271
00:19:16,901 --> 00:19:21,463
Last night l was intimate with someone.
More intimate than l've been in years...

272
00:19:23,141 --> 00:19:27,305
and now l can't do this today.
l'm confused.

273
00:19:27,645 --> 00:19:31,376
l'm sorry. Now l'm confused.
l thought you were with Liz last night.

274
00:19:41,292 --> 00:19:43,192
l'm gonna go play golf.

275
00:19:48,299 --> 00:19:49,823
Megan, it's Sean.

276
00:19:50,701 --> 00:19:52,726
My afternoon just opened up.

277
00:21:19,924 --> 00:21:23,189
You're a doctor.
You have to answer that, remember?

278
00:21:25,296 --> 00:21:28,959
For one afternoon in my life,
l'm gonna do what l wanna do...

279
00:21:29,033 --> 00:21:30,898
not what l have to do.

280
00:21:41,579 --> 00:21:42,568
Thanks.

281
00:21:46,717 --> 00:21:49,242
-Who is it?
-Office. Shit!

282
00:21:50,154 --> 00:21:51,314
Hello?

283
00:21:51,589 --> 00:21:53,989
Yeah, all right. l'll be there.

284
00:21:55,993 --> 00:21:59,087
-l forgot l scheduled surgery tonight.
-Tonight?

285
00:21:59,463 --> 00:22:03,832
-lsn't there somebody else on call?
-l'll make it up to you. l promise.

286
00:22:04,368 --> 00:22:07,633
But that's what we're
supposed to be doing tonight.

287
00:22:25,089 --> 00:22:27,580
<i>-Hi. lt's me.
-Kimber?</i>

288
00:22:30,661 --> 00:22:32,060
You're kidding.

289
00:22:33,064 --> 00:22:35,055
He said he had a surgery.

290
00:22:35,132 --> 00:22:37,965
He didn't even leave me money
for cab fare.

291
00:22:38,569 --> 00:22:40,833
Kimber, l hate to break it to you...

292
00:22:40,905 --> 00:22:44,363
but no plastic surgeon does surgery
after 6:00 on a weekday.

293
00:22:45,142 --> 00:22:46,666
lt's a diversion.

294
00:22:46,944 --> 00:22:49,435
You think he's seeing someone else?

295
00:22:49,947 --> 00:22:53,747
l've done the dinner page thing.
Ever single doctor l know has.

296
00:22:54,819 --> 00:22:58,778
lt's an ugly thing, is what it is.
But l stopped after l discovered kabala.

297
00:23:07,331 --> 00:23:08,662
lt's okay.

298
00:23:09,267 --> 00:23:11,167
Better to find out now.

299
00:23:27,618 --> 00:23:31,554
-Merrill.
-Phase two, seduction, is complete.

300
00:23:31,622 --> 00:23:34,887
She's in the bathroom barfing up
a bottle of Veuve. lt's going great.

301
00:23:34,959 --> 00:23:37,427
We're both going to hell for this,
you know.

302
00:23:37,495 --> 00:23:39,224
<i>As long as it ain't tonight.</i>

303
00:23:40,164 --> 00:23:42,189
She's weaving up. l gotta go.

304
00:23:44,869 --> 00:23:46,029
Jules?

305
00:23:52,476 --> 00:23:54,239
Where have you been?

306
00:23:54,512 --> 00:23:55,843
Late surgery.

307
00:23:56,380 --> 00:23:58,280
How was your day, Matt?

308
00:23:59,283 --> 00:24:00,477
Shitty.

309
00:24:01,752 --> 00:24:03,720
You wanna talk about it?

310
00:24:06,857 --> 00:24:10,759
l tried calling you earlier,
but the office said you were gone.

311
00:24:11,395 --> 00:24:14,228
You didn't answer your cell phone either.

312
00:24:14,999 --> 00:24:17,467
Well, l'm here now.

313
00:24:18,536 --> 00:24:20,265
What's on your mind?

314
00:24:21,272 --> 00:24:25,504
How come you never raised Annie and me
with any religious background?

315
00:24:27,144 --> 00:24:31,080
Your mother and l thought you should
make your own decisions about faith...

316
00:24:31,148 --> 00:24:32,809
when you're ready.

317
00:24:36,887 --> 00:24:39,048
Do you believe in God at all?

318
00:24:41,125 --> 00:24:43,719
Like if we hurt someone...

319
00:24:44,628 --> 00:24:46,994
and don't take responsibility...

320
00:24:47,465 --> 00:24:49,057
he knows about it.

321
00:24:50,534 --> 00:24:52,525
Because if that's true...

322
00:24:53,371 --> 00:24:56,499
we can't really get away
with anything, can we?

323
00:25:07,718 --> 00:25:09,652
What are you getting at, Matt?

324
00:25:13,991 --> 00:25:17,290
l'm saying you can lie to yourself...

325
00:25:17,728 --> 00:25:19,195
your friends...

326
00:25:19,697 --> 00:25:21,130
your family.

327
00:25:23,501 --> 00:25:25,492
But you can't lie to God.

328
00:25:27,671 --> 00:25:29,696
So the only thing to do...

329
00:25:31,375 --> 00:25:32,706
is confess.

330
00:25:35,379 --> 00:25:36,505
Right?

331
00:25:41,585 --> 00:25:43,348
How did you find out?

332
00:25:44,255 --> 00:25:47,190
When you opened the door
and saw us together?

333
00:25:52,062 --> 00:25:53,324
What did l see?

334
00:25:53,397 --> 00:25:56,798
Stop the games, Matt.
l'm telling you man-to-man.

335
00:25:56,867 --> 00:25:59,700
Yes, l'm having an affair.

336
00:26:12,583 --> 00:26:14,210
l'm gonna end it.

337
00:26:14,785 --> 00:26:17,583
l just needed something...

338
00:26:18,689 --> 00:26:20,384
and she gave it to me.

339
00:26:21,959 --> 00:26:24,086
How could you cheat on Mom?

340
00:26:25,763 --> 00:26:28,596
Your dad left you guys for another woman.

341
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,565
You told me that.

342
00:26:30,634 --> 00:26:33,432
You've been telling me that
since l was a little kid...

343
00:26:33,504 --> 00:26:35,472
about how that hurt you so much.

344
00:26:35,539 --> 00:26:37,632
l'm not my father. l'm not!

345
00:26:38,008 --> 00:26:41,535
Listen to me, Matt.
Nothing in your life is gonna be disrupted.

346
00:26:42,546 --> 00:26:44,275
You cheated on Mom?

347
00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:51,217
l don't know you right now.

348
00:26:55,659 --> 00:26:57,354
l won't see her again.

349
00:27:01,699 --> 00:27:03,826
You're more important to me.

350
00:27:06,237 --> 00:27:08,762
This family is more important to me.

351
00:27:17,314 --> 00:27:20,715
We won't tell your mom,
and this will all go away. l promise.

352
00:27:22,319 --> 00:27:23,650
l promise.

353
00:27:44,508 --> 00:27:45,668
Morning.

354
00:27:46,410 --> 00:27:47,672
What are you doing?

355
00:27:47,745 --> 00:27:51,704
l was staring at the nose job Christian
gave you. Frankly, l could've done better.

356
00:27:51,782 --> 00:27:53,181
Oh, my God!

357
00:27:56,453 --> 00:27:59,547
-Did we sleep together?
-Don't you remember?

358
00:28:02,226 --> 00:28:03,921
No, we didn't sleep together.

359
00:28:03,994 --> 00:28:06,690
l mean, we slept together,
but l didn't sleep.

360
00:28:06,764 --> 00:28:08,994
You snored. You were really drunk.

361
00:28:10,801 --> 00:28:12,860
Where are my clothes? l gotta go.

362
00:28:12,937 --> 00:28:13,926
Go where?

363
00:28:14,204 --> 00:28:16,695
Back to Christian,
to see if he'll forgive me.

364
00:28:16,774 --> 00:28:19,538
Forgive you? Come on. Get back in bed.

365
00:28:21,712 --> 00:28:24,374
Merrill, thank you for last night.

366
00:28:24,782 --> 00:28:28,479
Don't get the wrong impression.
There's nothing going on between us.

367
00:28:28,652 --> 00:28:30,381
You're not my type.

368
00:28:31,055 --> 00:28:32,920
How am l not your type?

369
00:28:32,990 --> 00:28:35,322
l make more money than Christian,
l'm more famous.

370
00:28:35,392 --> 00:28:38,884
Let's face the facts. You know
Christian will throw you out eventually...

371
00:28:38,963 --> 00:28:42,057
as your ass continues
its inevitable downward slide.

372
00:28:42,132 --> 00:28:43,394
But l won't.

373
00:28:44,735 --> 00:28:46,327
You don't even know me.

374
00:28:47,404 --> 00:28:51,340
Get it through your fuzzy head, okay?
l'm not attracted to you!

375
00:28:52,309 --> 00:28:55,278
You don't like the hair? Okay. lt's goofy.

376
00:28:55,646 --> 00:28:57,079
l'll change it for you.

377
00:28:57,147 --> 00:28:59,445
Yeah? Well, you'll still be a 4.

378
00:29:08,258 --> 00:29:09,555
l'm sorry.

379
00:29:10,928 --> 00:29:13,123
He's not gonna take you back.

380
00:29:13,464 --> 00:29:16,922
You two may look good together,
but you're not what he wants.

381
00:29:17,267 --> 00:29:18,791
You never were.

382
00:29:19,269 --> 00:29:21,396
He loves me. l know he does.

383
00:29:21,472 --> 00:29:23,770
He traded you for a goddamn car.

384
00:29:27,177 --> 00:29:28,906
How's that for love?

385
00:29:36,253 --> 00:29:38,949
Sean, Megan O'Hara again. Line two.

386
00:29:39,990 --> 00:29:42,823
l'm heading into a consult.
Take a message.

387
00:29:43,293 --> 00:29:46,023
You haven't returned my calls this week.

388
00:29:47,865 --> 00:29:49,799
-Why?
-l've been busy.

389
00:29:50,701 --> 00:29:52,601
l don't wanna study. l wanna talk.

390
00:29:52,670 --> 00:29:55,696
No, Jude. l get to talk. You get to listen.

391
00:29:56,140 --> 00:29:57,630
You're a liar.

392
00:29:59,276 --> 00:30:01,267
You're a liar and a fake.

393
00:30:05,315 --> 00:30:07,840
So that's why you called me over today?

394
00:30:08,018 --> 00:30:10,748
-'Cause you found out.
-Yeah. l found out.

395
00:30:11,922 --> 00:30:13,719
l wanted to tell you.

396
00:30:14,658 --> 00:30:17,786
You, of all people, but l didn't know how.

397
00:30:18,929 --> 00:30:22,126
So say it. Tell me what you are to my face.

398
00:30:28,739 --> 00:30:29,797
Okay.

399
00:30:33,844 --> 00:30:35,641
l'm not really British.

400
00:30:36,714 --> 00:30:39,274
l'm not from London.
l'm from New Hampshire.

401
00:30:40,517 --> 00:30:43,577
l started the whole accent thing
to boost business...

402
00:30:43,654 --> 00:30:45,679
when l moved out here last year.

403
00:30:46,757 --> 00:30:48,554
You're from New Hampshire.

404
00:30:48,625 --> 00:30:52,584
You know how women like
the whole foreign, sophisticated vibe...

405
00:30:54,431 --> 00:30:55,523
thing.

406
00:30:56,834 --> 00:30:58,199
Keep going.

407
00:30:58,368 --> 00:31:00,268
l told you everything.

408
00:31:02,673 --> 00:31:04,140
You hate me?

409
00:31:05,242 --> 00:31:07,733
-l hate myself.
-Why?

410
00:31:10,981 --> 00:31:15,645
l've been so desperately lonely
that l fell for a con man...

411
00:31:16,286 --> 00:31:18,049
who's also a hooker.

412
00:31:20,557 --> 00:31:23,822
l wasn't ever your friend.
l was just another paycheck.

413
00:31:24,795 --> 00:31:29,095
-Hold on. What are you talking about?
-Jude, l know!

414
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:32,467
l know women pay you for their orgasms.

415
00:31:33,070 --> 00:31:34,731
Who told you this?

416
00:31:37,574 --> 00:31:38,768
Suzanne?

417
00:31:41,378 --> 00:31:43,642
You trust that bitch over me?

418
00:31:45,983 --> 00:31:47,450
She hates you.

419
00:31:49,686 --> 00:31:52,120
How could you think that about me?

420
00:31:52,222 --> 00:31:55,123
That l would rent myself out
to women like her?

421
00:31:55,192 --> 00:31:57,752
l'm a trainer, Julia, not a whore!

422
00:32:01,632 --> 00:32:03,600
l guess 'cause l'm coming clean now...

423
00:32:03,667 --> 00:32:06,568
why don't we get everything out
in the open, okay?

424
00:32:07,838 --> 00:32:09,931
l do have feelings for you.

425
00:32:11,108 --> 00:32:14,339
And l know that it's wrong,
for the both of us...

426
00:32:18,849 --> 00:32:21,477
but l can't fight what l feel anymore.

427
00:32:25,823 --> 00:32:28,314
Get out, Jude. You can't afford me.

428
00:32:28,826 --> 00:32:32,318
So l made up a voice!
All right, but don't try and....

429
00:32:32,396 --> 00:32:36,662
Don't judge me for trying to be
a better person, a different person!

430
00:32:36,733 --> 00:32:39,429
Aren't you trying to do the same thing?

431
00:32:40,938 --> 00:32:42,701
You were a housewife.

432
00:32:42,773 --> 00:32:47,710
Now you're going to medical school, and
asking people to perceive you differently!

433
00:32:48,445 --> 00:32:50,743
And you won't give me that same break.

434
00:33:01,325 --> 00:33:02,917
You're very sad.

435
00:33:14,438 --> 00:33:16,429
Hi. Liz.

436
00:33:17,841 --> 00:33:19,069
We know.

437
00:33:28,285 --> 00:33:30,515
Where are my manners? Come in.

438
00:33:38,629 --> 00:33:40,392
Don't mind them, Liz.

439
00:33:40,464 --> 00:33:44,127
They just want me to take advantage
of my opportunities and get the surgery.

440
00:33:44,201 --> 00:33:45,429
So do l.

441
00:33:46,169 --> 00:33:48,137
lf that's what you want.

442
00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:52,873
l don't understand, Liz.
l thought you were confused, like me.

443
00:33:52,943 --> 00:33:55,138
Come on, Sophia, let's be real.

444
00:33:55,212 --> 00:33:58,670
We came together
out of loneliness, not passion.

445
00:34:00,751 --> 00:34:03,845
The truth is you like men. l like women.

446
00:34:04,721 --> 00:34:08,782
lt would be wonderful to look beyond
the wrapping for the real person inside.

447
00:34:08,859 --> 00:34:10,884
But l work for a plastic surgeon.

448
00:34:10,961 --> 00:34:14,158
l know more than anyone
that never really happens.

449
00:34:14,598 --> 00:34:16,361
Only in fairy tales.

450
00:34:17,901 --> 00:34:19,926
l guess l'm just thrown...

451
00:34:21,705 --> 00:34:25,436
because we had such chemistry, Liz.
That's rare.

452
00:34:25,876 --> 00:34:28,276
Chemistry can lead to friendship.

453
00:34:29,046 --> 00:34:31,981
And l'm here as your friend
to tell you that l think...

454
00:34:32,049 --> 00:34:35,507
that you want to become
a straight woman, and you should.

455
00:34:42,326 --> 00:34:45,386
The doctors have an opening
tomorrow afternoon.

456
00:34:47,030 --> 00:34:49,760
The appointment is yours if you want it.

457
00:34:54,004 --> 00:34:55,335
Hey, baby.

458
00:34:55,973 --> 00:34:57,565
See? l'm not mad.

459
00:34:58,542 --> 00:35:00,339
And why would you be?

460
00:35:02,846 --> 00:35:04,438
l know, Christian.

461
00:35:05,482 --> 00:35:06,881
About what?

462
00:35:07,584 --> 00:35:10,553
Honey, you don't have to lie anymore.

463
00:35:11,421 --> 00:35:13,946
Our whole relationship
was built on deceit.

464
00:35:14,024 --> 00:35:16,219
Can't we just end it in truth?

465
00:35:17,394 --> 00:35:19,794
l know you traded me for the car.

466
00:35:20,364 --> 00:35:22,229
Merrill told me everything.

467
00:35:23,367 --> 00:35:25,130
-You're not mad?
-Mad?

468
00:35:26,036 --> 00:35:27,799
How could l be mad?

469
00:35:28,238 --> 00:35:31,230
lsn't the Lamborghini worth $250,000?

470
00:35:31,975 --> 00:35:34,273
That must mean l'm worth a lot.

471
00:35:35,846 --> 00:35:38,041
At first l was a bit stung.

472
00:35:38,415 --> 00:35:40,212
But then l realized, shit.

473
00:35:40,517 --> 00:35:43,247
You're never gonna settle down.
Why should l?

474
00:35:43,653 --> 00:35:48,090
My modeling career is taking off.
That's what l want more than anything.

475
00:35:48,392 --> 00:35:50,019
Even more than you.

476
00:35:50,894 --> 00:35:53,328
l'm glad you realize that, Kimber.

477
00:35:53,830 --> 00:35:55,957
Maybe a break could be good for us.

478
00:35:56,033 --> 00:35:57,398
A break...

479
00:35:58,435 --> 00:36:00,426
with the occasional benefits.

480
00:36:03,740 --> 00:36:05,298
What are you doing?

481
00:36:06,843 --> 00:36:09,835
When l found out
how much the car was worth...

482
00:36:10,714 --> 00:36:12,079
l got hot.

483
00:36:13,784 --> 00:36:15,411
lsn't that weird?

484
00:36:18,755 --> 00:36:21,155
-Did he touch you?
-He tried.

485
00:36:22,426 --> 00:36:24,792
Doesn't that make you hot, too, baby...

486
00:36:24,861 --> 00:36:29,230
being able to screw now and then
what your biggest competitor couldn't?

487
00:36:31,168 --> 00:36:34,695
l know how you love to role play.
l've brought toys.

488
00:36:36,740 --> 00:36:38,401
What kind of toys?

489
00:36:45,916 --> 00:36:48,510
ls that as tight as you can make them?

490
00:36:50,487 --> 00:36:52,182
Where are you going?

491
00:36:54,057 --> 00:36:55,684
To get another toy.

492
00:37:02,365 --> 00:37:03,957
What's that for?

493
00:37:12,242 --> 00:37:15,006
You have no feelings whatsoever, do you?

494
00:37:28,558 --> 00:37:32,460
-l was wrong. You do.
-What are you doing, you crazy bitch?

495
00:37:33,196 --> 00:37:35,391
Getting ready to play doctor.

496
00:37:43,907 --> 00:37:46,432
You always play music
during a surgery, right?

497
00:37:46,510 --> 00:37:49,377
Let me go. Please.

498
00:37:49,946 --> 00:37:52,881
-l have to go to the bathroom.
-Not my problem.

499
00:37:57,354 --> 00:37:58,787
You're the one.

500
00:37:59,890 --> 00:38:02,620
The one who vandalized my car, my boat.

501
00:38:04,227 --> 00:38:05,592
lt's you.

502
00:38:06,897 --> 00:38:08,694
l don't know, Christian.

503
00:38:10,233 --> 00:38:13,634
lt looks like you could be getting
some love handles.

504
00:38:14,404 --> 00:38:16,395
l could fix that for you.

505
00:38:17,741 --> 00:38:20,733
Hell, if you can do it, how hard could it be?

506
00:38:27,784 --> 00:38:30,116
You know what l see, Christian?

507
00:38:30,220 --> 00:38:34,020
l see an asshole
who has spent his whole life...

508
00:38:34,090 --> 00:38:37,082
hurting other people
because he hates himself.

509
00:38:38,094 --> 00:38:42,588
l think the rest of the world
needs to see what a mess you really are.

510
00:38:51,141 --> 00:38:54,406
First, we're gonna carve open
the eyes a bit...

511
00:38:54,978 --> 00:38:58,414
so you can actually notice something
besides yourself.

512
00:38:59,249 --> 00:39:03,015
You fight me, and l will make you ugly.
l swear to God!

513
00:39:17,601 --> 00:39:21,662
After the eyes, we're gonna cut off
the other side of the mouth...

514
00:39:21,838 --> 00:39:24,898
the one that you talk shit out of
all the time.

515
00:39:40,590 --> 00:39:41,682
Wait.

516
00:39:43,693 --> 00:39:46,491
Do you think if l stab you here,
you'll even bleed...

517
00:39:46,563 --> 00:39:48,497
considering you don't have a heart?

518
00:39:48,565 --> 00:39:50,260
Don't do it, Kimber.

519
00:39:51,968 --> 00:39:54,903
You'll go to jail. Your career will be over.

520
00:39:54,971 --> 00:39:58,202
l'm pushing 30. My career is already over.

521
00:39:59,009 --> 00:40:02,706
Kimber, l'm sorry. l'm really, truly sorry.

522
00:40:02,812 --> 00:40:05,076
You're sorry? Then cry for me.

523
00:40:07,083 --> 00:40:08,550
Cry for me!

524
00:40:09,552 --> 00:40:12,077
Goddamn it, cry for me!

525
00:40:19,129 --> 00:40:23,259
l tried so hard
to make this relationship work.

526
00:40:23,333 --> 00:40:27,793
l tried so hard, Christian.
Why couldn't you just love me?

527
00:40:31,207 --> 00:40:32,697
lt's not you.

528
00:40:34,711 --> 00:40:36,576
l've never loved anyone.

529
00:40:49,059 --> 00:40:50,549
You know what?

530
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:52,359
l can't kill you.

531
00:40:53,063 --> 00:40:54,826
You're already dead.

532
00:41:14,651 --> 00:41:16,551
Just so we're clear...

533
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:18,615
l'm keeping the car.

534
00:41:22,759 --> 00:41:25,455
You can't just leave me here like this.

535
00:41:26,996 --> 00:41:30,363
You'll be fine, Christian.
Your maid comes on Friday.

536
00:41:39,676 --> 00:41:43,578
Sean, sorry. Megan O'Hara again.
She says it's an emergency.

537
00:41:44,447 --> 00:41:47,245
-l'll call her back.
-She's in your office.

538
00:41:54,124 --> 00:41:57,321
The cancer's metastasized
in my lymph nodes.

539
00:41:57,394 --> 00:41:59,191
lt's already stage four.

540
00:42:00,163 --> 00:42:02,290
My oncologist thinks...

541
00:42:03,733 --> 00:42:06,827
the implant operation
lowered my immune system.

542
00:42:07,604 --> 00:42:12,098
The stress of the recovery
helped the tumors get a strong foothold.

543
00:42:14,911 --> 00:42:17,903
No one could have predicted this, Sean.
lt's not your fault.

544
00:42:17,981 --> 00:42:20,074
You warned me of the risks.

545
00:42:28,658 --> 00:42:30,853
There are ways to fight this, Megan.

546
00:42:30,927 --> 00:42:34,192
Chemo won't work this time.
There's already fluid in the lungs.

547
00:42:34,264 --> 00:42:36,789
Then we'll look at other treatments.

548
00:42:36,866 --> 00:42:38,891
l.C.H. therapy, for instance.

549
00:42:38,968 --> 00:42:42,301
lt's aggressive, not like chemo.
lt heats up cells from the inside--

550
00:42:42,372 --> 00:42:45,034
l don't need another doctor
right now, Sean.

551
00:42:46,443 --> 00:42:47,808
l need you.

552
00:42:51,981 --> 00:42:53,812
But l can't have you, can l?

553
00:42:58,588 --> 00:43:00,055
You're married.

554
00:43:00,757 --> 00:43:03,749
You have kids, a career,
everything to lose.

555
00:43:05,595 --> 00:43:06,926
l'm sorry.

556
00:43:07,897 --> 00:43:09,888
This is not your problem.

557
00:43:16,473 --> 00:43:18,464
Hey, you're right.

558
00:43:19,676 --> 00:43:21,906
l do have everything to lose.

559
00:43:23,046 --> 00:43:24,946
That didn't stop me before...

560
00:43:26,683 --> 00:43:28,651
and it won't stop me now.

561
00:43:29,953 --> 00:43:31,215
l'm here.

562
00:43:43,299 --> 00:43:44,891
l'm afraid, Liz.

563
00:43:45,201 --> 00:43:48,693
Hold my hand during the surgery
like you did last night.

564
00:43:48,771 --> 00:43:52,901
Sophia, you are the neediest chick
l ever almost dated.

565
00:43:54,677 --> 00:43:56,304
Of course l will.

566
00:43:58,615 --> 00:44:03,279
Sophia, before we begin the surgery,
l need to make absolutely sure...

567
00:44:04,087 --> 00:44:06,180
are you prepared this time?

568
00:44:06,523 --> 00:44:08,787
Because it's not gonna grow back.

569
00:44:10,159 --> 00:44:11,319
Yes.

570
00:44:13,830 --> 00:44:16,162
All right. Let's do it.

571
00:44:18,835 --> 00:44:22,635
Someday we'll find the one
who loves us for who we are, Liz.

572
00:44:24,073 --> 00:44:26,041
A girl can dream, right?

573
00:44:31,381 --> 00:44:33,781
l need you to count back from 10.

574
00:44:36,419 --> 00:44:37,613
Ten...

575
00:44:38,121 --> 00:44:39,349
nine...

576
00:44:40,423 --> 00:44:41,651
eight....

577
00:44:54,370 --> 00:44:55,894
Let's prep her.

578
00:46:32,568 --> 00:46:33,557
