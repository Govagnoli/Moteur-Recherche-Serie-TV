1
00:00:03,895 --> 00:00:05,048
Nicole Moretti?

2
00:00:05,390 --> 00:00:07,500
I'm Dr. McNamara. I'll be doing your surgery.

3
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:08,840
Please call me Nikki.

4
00:00:09,564 --> 00:00:12,171
Your safe house isn't gonna be ready for a week.

5
00:00:12,448 --> 00:00:14,127
You could finish healing here.

6
00:00:14,317 --> 00:00:15,713
You shouldn't have brought them here, doctor.

7
00:00:15,801 --> 00:00:16,756
They're not prisoners.

8
00:00:16,855 --> 00:00:22,524
Mrs. Moretti's husband wasn't killed because he was talking to us.

9
00:00:22,629 --> 00:00:26,158
She killed him because he found out she was.

10
00:00:33,936 --> 00:00:36,474
I understand you're the one who made the appointment, Ms. Tedesco?

11
00:00:36,569 --> 00:00:37,217
Yes.

12
00:00:37,328 --> 00:00:41,365
In that case, tell me what you don't like about yourself.

13
00:00:43,398 --> 00:00:45,337
That's not why I'm here.

14
00:00:46,207 --> 00:00:49,588
Illana and I came here to speak on behalf of our daughters

15
00:00:49,694 --> 00:00:51,314
and to ask for your help.

16
00:00:51,458 --> 00:00:53,357
Oh? In what way?

17
00:00:57,744 --> 00:01:01,151
I should show you Hannah first.

18
00:01:08,962 --> 00:01:10,204
How did this happen?

19
00:01:10,382 --> 00:01:11,911
A carnival ride.

20
00:01:12,865 --> 00:01:16,323
Hannah's ponytail caught around one of the gears while it was moving.

21
00:01:16,373 --> 00:01:20,202
She couldn't get out of her seat, and the force just...

22
00:01:21,312 --> 00:01:22,865
ripped everything away.

23
00:01:22,965 --> 00:01:25,464
Aw, that's awful. I'm so sorry.

24
00:01:27,812 --> 00:01:29,944
How many grafts has she had so far?

25
00:01:30,032 --> 00:01:31,076
18.

26
00:01:31,694 --> 00:01:33,759
No matter how many we do, every doctor I've talked to

27
00:01:33,846 --> 00:01:36,444
says she'll never look much better than she does now.

28
00:01:38,036 --> 00:01:40,810
Ms. Manning, your daughter was in the accident as well?

29
00:01:40,906 --> 00:01:42,103
Lisa, no.

30
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:45,526
No. She has type one diabetes.

31
00:01:45,663 --> 00:01:47,568
She went into a coma 9 months ago.

32
00:01:47,678 --> 00:01:49,047
She's been on life support.

33
00:01:49,155 --> 00:01:52,347
Illana and I met at the hospital where Hannah was being treated.

34
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:55,867
We're both single moms so the support meant a lot.

35
00:01:56,306 --> 00:01:59,137
And I'm the first one to bring it up.

36
00:01:59,924 --> 00:02:01,047
Bring up what?

37
00:02:01,787 --> 00:02:03,848
My daughter is clinically brain-dead.

38
00:02:03,962 --> 00:02:07,968
Her doctors think they can keep her alive maybe another 6 months.

39
00:02:08,155 --> 00:02:10,496
But I've decided to let her die with dignity,

40
00:02:10,577 --> 00:02:13,039
and I'd like to donate her face to Hannah.

41
00:02:13,728 --> 00:02:15,867
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

42
00:02:15,952 --> 00:02:17,284
Donate her face?

43
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:21,003
Yes. Right now we're looking for surgeons

44
00:02:21,081 --> 00:02:24,821
who would be willing to perform a facial transplant surgery.

45
00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:29,728
That procedure is still only theoretical.

46
00:02:30,056 --> 00:02:32,577
A surgeon in Rome performed a partial surgery, but--

47
00:02:32,667 --> 00:02:36,079
All of the doctors we've interviewed in Europe and in the states,

48
00:02:36,108 --> 00:02:41,195
all of the research we've done over the past 6 months, proves the same theory.

49
00:02:41,291 --> 00:02:43,873
That because of advents in autoimmune therapy,

50
00:02:43,982 --> 00:02:47,461
a transplant that is successful is now possible.

51
00:02:47,573 --> 00:02:49,651
The problem has been finding suitable candidates

52
00:02:49,745 --> 00:02:51,560
and matching them with qualified surgeons.

53
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:54,698
Now, Hannah and Lisa are ideal for this.

54
00:02:54,791 --> 00:02:58,391
They have similar bone structure, delicate features.

55
00:02:58,493 --> 00:03:01,638
And McNamara/Troy is one of the best teams out there.

56
00:03:01,773 --> 00:03:05,745
You were the doctors brave enough to perform the conjoined twin surgery last year.

57
00:03:05,844 --> 00:03:10,251
Yes, we did, but Dr. McNamara is no longer a part of this practice.

58
00:03:10,344 --> 00:03:16,686
Although, thankfully, Dr. Troy and I have continued to build on that stellar reputation.

59
00:03:19,004 --> 00:03:22,375
Ultimate success will depend largely upon

60
00:03:22,458 --> 00:03:25,914
immunosuppressive therapy following the surgery.

61
00:03:25,998 --> 00:03:32,091
Barring that, I really don't see any reason to turn down this request.

62
00:03:37,132 --> 00:03:39,567
There are some ethical considerations.

63
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:40,713
Like what?

64
00:03:40,841 --> 00:03:43,961
Organ donation is generally an anonymous transaction.

65
00:03:44,055 --> 00:03:46,112
Removing your daughter's face, her identity,

66
00:03:46,206 --> 00:03:48,564
and transferring it to a relative stranger

67
00:03:48,649 --> 00:03:51,569
could be a disaster for you both, let alone Hannah.

68
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:55,662
My daughter's identity, doctor, was her spirit,

69
00:03:55,761 --> 00:03:58,325
which is now gone.

70
00:03:58,502 --> 00:04:03,074
She can't go out in public. People stare. They make fun.

71
00:04:04,041 --> 00:04:06,926
My daughter had such confidence, you know.

72
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:11,144
This is the only way for her to get back what she's lost.

73
00:04:12,041 --> 00:04:16,335
50 years ago, people thought that kidney transplants were immoral.

74
00:04:16,445 --> 00:04:18,768
My daughter went into a coma waiting for a transplant

75
00:04:18,867 --> 00:04:21,162
because too many people still believe that.

76
00:04:21,286 --> 00:04:25,389
I understand, but donating a kidney is about saving a life.

77
00:04:25,469 --> 00:04:27,810
What we're talking about is very different.

78
00:04:27,913 --> 00:04:30,784
The risks involved in what is basically an elective surgery--

79
00:04:30,876 --> 00:04:34,048
This is about saving a life, Dr. Troy.

80
00:04:34,642 --> 00:04:40,047
Before the accident Hannah was a beautiful girl with a bright future.

81
00:04:40,168 --> 00:04:44,023
This is the only way for her to look and feel

82
00:04:44,147 --> 00:04:47,066
and live like a normal person again.

83
00:04:47,154 --> 00:04:51,190
Please, give her that chance.

84
00:05:57,339 --> 00:06:00,139
That was my first good night's sleep in...

85
00:06:01,035 --> 00:06:02,410
I don't remember.

86
00:06:04,469 --> 00:06:05,852
Is there more coffee?

87
00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:11,813
What do you think smells better?

88
00:06:12,475 --> 00:06:17,636
Late afternoon thunderstorm or that first cup of coffee in the morning?

89
00:06:18,182 --> 00:06:19,641
Did you kill your husband?

90
00:06:24,033 --> 00:06:25,407
Why are you asking me that?

91
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:28,144
I can't have any more dishonesty in this house, Nikki.

92
00:06:28,290 --> 00:06:31,722
I dealt with that in my marriage and my business. I need to hear the truth from you.

93
00:06:32,439 --> 00:06:34,047
Did you kill your husband?

94
00:06:38,336 --> 00:06:39,856
Where is all this coming from?

95
00:06:40,841 --> 00:06:42,344
I talked to Sagamore.

96
00:06:42,674 --> 00:06:44,054
He told me everything.

97
00:06:44,401 --> 00:06:47,069
How you got your husband drunk, then shot him in the head.

98
00:06:47,168 --> 00:06:48,719
That's premeditated murder.

99
00:06:52,293 --> 00:06:55,559
You have been lied to, Sean.

100
00:07:02,292 --> 00:07:05,477
Vic found out that I was talking to the FBI.

101
00:07:08,941 --> 00:07:12,047
He dragged me out of bed and tried to kill me.

102
00:07:12,779 --> 00:07:15,645
He used his fists,

103
00:07:17,276 --> 00:07:18,486
a chair.

104
00:07:19,239 --> 00:07:24,010
I managed to break free long enough to grab one of the guns he has in his nightstand.

105
00:07:27,303 --> 00:07:29,269
Even then I didn't want to shoot him.

106
00:07:29,385 --> 00:07:31,383
I just asked him to leave.

107
00:07:34,261 --> 00:07:36,771
He came at me and I pulled the trigger.

108
00:07:38,909 --> 00:07:41,558
If it was really self-defense, why didn't you just tell me?

109
00:07:42,014 --> 00:07:44,234
You trusted me enough to come home with me.

110
00:07:44,627 --> 00:07:46,265
To bring your son in my house.

111
00:07:46,371 --> 00:07:49,152
To sleep in my bed. Was that all just a lie, too?

112
00:07:50,450 --> 00:07:52,498
Does it really feel that way to you?

113
00:07:54,738 --> 00:07:59,072
I'm sorry. I wanted things to work so bad.

114
00:07:59,549 --> 00:08:00,962
The three of us.

115
00:08:02,096 --> 00:08:05,376
I liked thinking about a future together.

116
00:08:08,225 --> 00:08:09,259
You do?

117
00:08:14,577 --> 00:08:16,637
I've sort of felt the same thing.

118
00:08:17,924 --> 00:08:19,305
About the three of us.

119
00:08:23,447 --> 00:08:25,292
You just like my cooking.

120
00:08:28,271 --> 00:08:29,518
Sorry, honey,

121
00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:32,952
your cooking ain't that hot.

122
00:08:38,618 --> 00:08:39,715
But you are.

123
00:08:45,489 --> 00:08:47,870
So what you're saying is...

124
00:08:49,749 --> 00:08:51,757
there's hope here?

125
00:08:53,291 --> 00:08:55,955
If from here on out everything's on the table.

126
00:08:56,889 --> 00:08:58,818
There can't be any more lies

127
00:08:59,042 --> 00:09:03,893
about who we really are or what we do or what we've done.

128
00:09:24,008 --> 00:09:25,559
Take me back to bed.

129
00:09:32,452 --> 00:09:36,089
Well, that's not accurate. You didn't come 6 times, it was 7.

130
00:09:37,002 --> 00:09:39,295
Because I remember these things.

131
00:09:41,111 --> 00:09:45,947
Please. Look, of course it's gonna be an exclusive. Have I ever lied to you?

132
00:09:47,050 --> 00:09:51,922
Patient's name is Hannah Tedesco. T-E-D-E-S-C-O.

133
00:09:52,564 --> 00:09:54,593
Am I hard right now?

134
00:09:54,777 --> 00:09:58,075
With you, my love, it's always like a rock.

135
00:10:01,046 --> 00:10:02,427
Talk to you later, Chris.

136
00:10:05,483 --> 00:10:09,271
Guess whose literary agent contact just got us the lead story

137
00:10:09,343 --> 00:10:11,832
in next month's New england journal of medicine?

138
00:10:11,924 --> 00:10:14,076
Is Chris a girl or a boy?

139
00:10:17,612 --> 00:10:19,174
She's a girl, Christian.

140
00:10:19,310 --> 00:10:21,446
With a bit of a mustache problem, so I just pretend

141
00:10:21,528 --> 00:10:23,882
that she's a boy when I'm banging her in the ass.

142
00:10:24,017 --> 00:10:24,896
Nice.

143
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:28,180
So's the publicity that this Tedesco surgery is gonna bring in.

144
00:10:29,384 --> 00:10:30,860
This is a goddamn windfall.

145
00:10:30,964 --> 00:10:34,209
This is exactly what you and I need to increase

146
00:10:34,303 --> 00:10:37,040
our profile in the international medical community.

147
00:10:37,277 --> 00:10:42,543
This is gonna totally change the face of this business. Pun intended.

148
00:10:42,648 --> 00:10:46,279
The face of this business has never been to exploit a surgery,

149
00:10:46,385 --> 00:10:48,505
especially before we know the results.

150
00:10:48,604 --> 00:10:51,799
Hey, win or lose, we're gonna wind up on the front page

151
00:10:51,874 --> 00:10:54,488
of the New York Times if we spin this properly.

152
00:10:54,588 --> 00:10:57,727
And guess what? If this doesn't work, we are not gonna get blamed for it,

153
00:10:57,834 --> 00:10:59,589
the patient's immune system will.

154
00:11:04,069 --> 00:11:05,810
Thank you for squeezing me in.

155
00:11:05,908 --> 00:11:09,508
Your head nurse said you were just crazy preparing for some big surgery.

156
00:11:12,001 --> 00:11:14,939
Tell me what you don't like about yourself, Mrs. Eubanks.

157
00:11:15,095 --> 00:11:17,762
My husband doesn't want to have sex with me anymore.

158
00:11:18,799 --> 00:11:20,684
That's entirely too upsetting, isn't it?

159
00:11:20,789 --> 00:11:22,884
He only likes screwing your fiancee.

160
00:11:23,547 --> 00:11:24,493
Excuse me?

161
00:11:24,607 --> 00:11:26,749
Kimber Henry. She's you're fiancee, right?

162
00:11:26,848 --> 00:11:29,918
I read about your engagement on spankgossip.com.

163
00:11:30,025 --> 00:11:32,409
Go back to the part about your husband screwing my fiancee.

164
00:11:32,508 --> 00:11:36,716
Her doll. The life-size Ms. Kimber doll she has on the market. That's what I meant.

165
00:11:36,929 --> 00:11:37,924
Your husband has one of those?

166
00:11:38,018 --> 00:11:40,177
Oh, yeah. I bought it for him.

167
00:11:40,431 --> 00:11:41,336
Why?

168
00:11:41,814 --> 00:11:44,721
You're not married yet, so you probably don't have this problem,

169
00:11:44,798 --> 00:11:48,771
but Mark and I have been together almost 10 years,

170
00:11:48,917 --> 00:11:50,999
and the sex gets a little routine.

171
00:11:51,094 --> 00:11:53,417
So I bought the doll to spice things up.

172
00:11:53,535 --> 00:11:54,631
Mark flipped.

173
00:11:54,733 --> 00:11:57,748
He loved to twist her in all these crazy positions, and dress her up in lingerie,

174
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:59,581
and do us both at the same time.

175
00:11:59,677 --> 00:12:01,550
How can I help you, Mrs. Eubanks?

176
00:12:02,061 --> 00:12:06,849
Oh, well, about 6 months ago Mark stopped having sex with me

177
00:12:06,933 --> 00:12:09,040
and would only get off with the doll.

178
00:12:09,497 --> 00:12:11,607
Sometimes 4 times a day.

179
00:12:11,805 --> 00:12:16,247
I know this sounds crazy, but if I don't change something now, I'm gonna lose him.

180
00:12:16,536 --> 00:12:17,566
What are you suggesting?

181
00:12:17,659 --> 00:12:18,816
Nothing too radical.

182
00:12:18,947 --> 00:12:22,128
Maybe go up a cup size, lift my ass a little bit,

183
00:12:22,221 --> 00:12:25,614
and, if you think I need it, reshaping my...

184
00:12:26,267 --> 00:12:30,842
you know... place... like hers.

185
00:12:31,369 --> 00:12:33,830
You want me to make you look like a Kimber doll?

186
00:12:33,923 --> 00:12:37,355
What better person to go to than the man who sleeps with the original, right?

187
00:12:37,528 --> 00:12:40,337
Let me save you a lot of money, ok?

188
00:12:40,448 --> 00:12:42,346
Throw the doll away when your husband's not home.

189
00:12:42,444 --> 00:12:43,834
That way, he has to sleep with you.

190
00:12:43,936 --> 00:12:45,721
Are you crazy? He'd kill me.

191
00:12:45,841 --> 00:12:48,312
I swear, I think Mark is in love with her.

192
00:12:49,584 --> 00:12:54,182
Mrs. Eubanks, not to be cruel, but have you no sense of self?

193
00:12:55,029 --> 00:12:58,459
My husband would rather screw a doll than me, ok?

194
00:12:58,649 --> 00:13:02,096
I think my sense of self is pretty much in the toilet.

195
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:06,717
Please, I want to be my husband's fantasy again.

196
00:13:08,181 --> 00:13:09,822
Make me like Kimber.

197
00:13:14,749 --> 00:13:17,193
My mom tried tossing a baseball with me once.

198
00:13:17,662 --> 00:13:18,990
She was horrible.

199
00:13:19,163 --> 00:13:20,333
Weren't you, mom?

200
00:13:20,664 --> 00:13:23,044
Hey, at least I get points for trying, don't I?

201
00:13:25,799 --> 00:13:27,991
You must've played a lot of catch with your dad.

202
00:13:28,610 --> 00:13:29,447
No.

203
00:13:30,730 --> 00:13:32,215
He never wanted to.

204
00:13:32,995 --> 00:13:34,799
He wasn't cool like you are.

205
00:13:44,898 --> 00:13:47,049
That doesn't mean you can hog the ball now.

206
00:13:50,504 --> 00:13:51,534
Pop fly.

207
00:13:54,572 --> 00:13:57,676
Hey, look at that. Future hall-of-famer right there.

208
00:14:03,922 --> 00:14:04,661
Sean!

209
00:14:06,269 --> 00:14:07,291
Austin!

210
00:14:07,546 --> 00:14:08,280
What?

211
00:14:08,596 --> 00:14:10,339
I'm sorry. He was supposed to catch it.

212
00:14:10,443 --> 00:14:11,541
You're right, it was my fault.

213
00:14:11,633 --> 00:14:12,509
No, no, no.

214
00:14:12,597 --> 00:14:14,640
I'll take this to the bathroom, run some water on it.

215
00:14:14,703 --> 00:14:15,806
Thank you.

216
00:14:16,108 --> 00:14:18,937
What are you doing, you crazy kook? Help me out.

217
00:14:41,748 --> 00:14:43,137
He's a cute kid.

218
00:14:44,145 --> 00:14:45,698
That one you were playing catch with.

219
00:14:46,710 --> 00:14:48,491
I thought I'd never get you alone.

220
00:14:51,353 --> 00:14:52,446
Who are you? Who sent you?

221
00:14:52,525 --> 00:14:53,299
What are you doing?

222
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:54,548
How'd you find us?

223
00:14:54,831 --> 00:14:57,045
I don't know what you're talking about. You're the one who gave me the sign.

224
00:14:57,139 --> 00:14:58,233
Sign? What sign?

225
00:14:58,326 --> 00:14:59,888
The glory hole sign.

226
00:15:00,978 --> 00:15:03,304
That's what men use this bathroom for.

227
00:15:04,005 --> 00:15:06,458
You thought I wanted to give you a blow job?

228
00:15:07,252 --> 00:15:09,753
Why else would you be staring at me like that?

229
00:15:11,002 --> 00:15:12,301
It's ok.

230
00:15:12,733 --> 00:15:14,745
So we got our signals crossed.

231
00:15:15,899 --> 00:15:17,357
You gonna let me go or what?

232
00:15:19,174 --> 00:15:20,487
Asshole.

233
00:15:21,188 --> 00:15:22,982
You're lucky I don't call a cop.

234
00:15:27,208 --> 00:15:30,965
Next time don't be such a flirty bitch, we won't have that problem.

235
00:15:45,102 --> 00:15:47,650
I hope you're hungry because we got way too much food.

236
00:15:47,732 --> 00:15:48,681
We have to go.

237
00:15:49,738 --> 00:15:50,347
What?

238
00:15:50,432 --> 00:15:52,600
I'm sorry, this is wonderful, but we have to.

239
00:15:52,757 --> 00:15:54,301
Take Austin and go wait in the car.

240
00:15:54,426 --> 00:15:56,468
What is going on? Did somebody follow us?

241
00:15:56,557 --> 00:16:00,189
No, no. I--I'm just not feeling well all of a sudden.

242
00:16:00,253 --> 00:16:03,209
I get allergies and, you know, they get serious.

243
00:16:03,477 --> 00:16:05,997
We can still have the picnic at home. It'll be fine.

244
00:16:06,112 --> 00:16:07,151
Let's just go.

245
00:16:17,424 --> 00:16:18,501
When do we start?

246
00:16:29,446 --> 00:16:30,359
Ms. Manning?

247
00:16:32,729 --> 00:16:35,537
As soon as you're ready, we can begin.

248
00:16:41,235 --> 00:16:42,490
27 hours.

249
00:16:44,773 --> 00:16:46,716
That's how long my labor was.

250
00:16:49,523 --> 00:16:54,073
I used to think the hardest thing I ever did was give birth to her.

251
00:16:58,039 --> 00:17:03,552
I never imagined how much worse it would be to send her from this world.

252
00:17:17,281 --> 00:17:19,009
Take as much time as you need.

253
00:17:21,488 --> 00:17:23,930
No, I'm ok. I'm ready.

254
00:17:24,704 --> 00:17:25,266
Ok.

255
00:17:32,658 --> 00:17:35,461
I'll see you again soon, ok, sweetheart?

256
00:17:36,634 --> 00:17:37,457
Ok.

257
00:17:44,772 --> 00:17:47,426
Is--is it all right if I do it?

258
00:18:21,279 --> 00:18:22,072
Doctor.

259
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:32,121
We're not gonna rush her.

260
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:34,201
Stop looking at your watch.

261
00:18:34,864 --> 00:18:36,587
Why in the hell are you so jumpy?

262
00:18:37,144 --> 00:18:40,406
Oh. I'm not jumpy, I'm excited.

263
00:18:41,246 --> 00:18:43,060
This is what life's about, Christian.

264
00:18:43,169 --> 00:18:45,076
Pushing your talents to the limits.

265
00:18:45,347 --> 00:18:46,967
Seeing what you're made of.

266
00:18:48,994 --> 00:18:51,225
Well, she just gave up her daughter.

267
00:18:51,497 --> 00:18:52,940
You need to respect that.

268
00:19:06,361 --> 00:19:07,298
All right.

269
00:19:07,781 --> 00:19:08,876
Let's do it.

270
00:19:25,828 --> 00:19:27,902
Are you hot? Is it hot in here?

271
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:36,313
Uh, can you turn up the air?

272
00:19:41,297 --> 00:19:42,148
Marker.

273
00:19:46,663 --> 00:19:47,699
Marker.

274
00:20:04,781 --> 00:20:05,866
You ready?

275
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:10,173
Christian, are you ready?

276
00:21:32,032 --> 00:21:38,359
Well, it's 3:15, so we have until 6:00 to get this back to the office for reattachment.

277
00:21:39,101 --> 00:21:40,869
This is gonna be an all-nighter.

278
00:21:40,974 --> 00:21:45,259
Maybe it's not a bad idea for us to pull in another surgeon for the second phase.

279
00:21:45,848 --> 00:21:50,593
Well, I think between the two of us, we're more than capable of doing the work...

280
00:21:51,092 --> 00:21:52,752
and reaping the rewards.

281
00:22:07,841 --> 00:22:10,668
I had to promise him you two would play more catch tomorrow.

282
00:22:11,511 --> 00:22:13,253
He's really upset.

283
00:22:14,841 --> 00:22:16,819
What happened in the park, Sean?

284
00:22:16,918 --> 00:22:20,085
One minute we're having a great time. The next we're being thrown into a car.

285
00:22:21,306 --> 00:22:25,593
You were the one who said we have to start being completely honest with each other.

286
00:22:25,675 --> 00:22:28,751
- If you can't do that now--
- Something did happen.

287
00:22:29,151 --> 00:22:30,518
In the bathroom.

288
00:22:31,592 --> 00:22:34,591
There was some guy I thought was following us.

289
00:22:36,071 --> 00:22:38,034
And I knocked him out.

290
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:39,596
You did what?

291
00:22:39,639 --> 00:22:42,541
He was some pervert. He followed me to the bathroom.

292
00:22:42,613 --> 00:22:46,824
He said the wrong thing, and I mistakenly thought he wanted to hurt you... us.

293
00:22:46,873 --> 00:22:48,992
And I knocked him out.

294
00:22:49,077 --> 00:22:51,067
I didn't say anything because I didn't want you to overreact

295
00:22:51,153 --> 00:22:53,911
and think you and Austin were in any kind of danger.

296
00:22:54,292 --> 00:22:57,279
What happened was a complete case of mistaken identity. That's all.

297
00:22:57,378 --> 00:22:58,619
I knew it.

298
00:22:59,834 --> 00:23:02,101
I could feel somebody watching us.

299
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:08,133
He waited until we separated and then he went for you first.

300
00:23:08,233 --> 00:23:09,472
But I told you, he was just some kind of--

301
00:23:09,576 --> 00:23:13,764
No. You don't understand who these people are, Sean, how they operate.

302
00:23:13,872 --> 00:23:18,402
They know I changed my face, and they will track you down first to get to me and Austin.

303
00:23:18,495 --> 00:23:19,957
You didn't overreact at all.

304
00:23:20,063 --> 00:23:23,115
All right, let's just calm down and be rational, ok?

305
00:23:23,219 --> 00:23:25,299
We have to leave.

306
00:23:26,764 --> 00:23:28,141
I'm sorry.

307
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:31,690
It's too dangerous for us now.

308
00:23:31,779 --> 00:23:34,191
Leave? That's it? You're just gonna disappear now?

309
00:23:34,278 --> 00:23:35,962
This is exactly the reaction I didn't want.

310
00:23:36,053 --> 00:23:38,835
If we stay together, we could all wind up dead.

311
00:23:41,413 --> 00:23:43,267
What if I joined the program?

312
00:23:44,915 --> 00:23:47,902
If we both get new identities, they'll never find us.

313
00:23:52,404 --> 00:23:53,943
You would do that?

314
00:23:55,424 --> 00:23:58,881
Leave everything? Just disappear?

315
00:24:04,527 --> 00:24:06,781
I already have, remember?

316
00:24:21,035 --> 00:24:24,509
I'm gonna go change. Then you and I have to have a talk.

317
00:24:26,393 --> 00:24:27,366
Hi, sweetie.

318
00:24:31,257 --> 00:24:32,368
Who's in the living room?

319
00:24:32,465 --> 00:24:33,864
You don't recognize her?

320
00:24:34,494 --> 00:24:36,901
Perfect. You're gonna love this.

321
00:24:37,094 --> 00:24:39,857
Ms. Kimber, could you come into the bedroom, please?

322
00:24:43,669 --> 00:24:47,206
Honey, you remember Colleen Eubanks, don't you?

323
00:24:48,152 --> 00:24:50,767
You gave her a consult yesterday.

324
00:24:51,204 --> 00:24:54,182
After our meeting, I got the feeling you weren't gonna do the work.

325
00:24:54,298 --> 00:24:56,858
Then I figured, why not go straight to the source?

326
00:24:57,028 --> 00:25:01,571
We talked all about the problem with her husband, and I felt so bad.

327
00:25:01,694 --> 00:25:03,596
But then I had a great idea.

328
00:25:03,694 --> 00:25:06,470
And you were right, by the way. Surgery was way too extreme.

329
00:25:06,581 --> 00:25:09,839
All men really want is the fantasy, right. It's why the doll works.

330
00:25:10,025 --> 00:25:13,975
So I thought I would give Colleen a few tips on how to be Kimber.

331
00:25:14,083 --> 00:25:15,634
Like the walk...

332
00:25:17,610 --> 00:25:19,320
the pouty face...

333
00:25:20,458 --> 00:25:23,558
- how to push your tits up so--
- Stop it!

334
00:25:24,547 --> 00:25:28,592
This is ridiculous. I'm tired, and I need to prepare for surgery.

335
00:25:28,674 --> 00:25:31,454
I don't need to deal with any of this frivolous bullshit.

336
00:25:31,887 --> 00:25:33,661
And get out of my apartment. And when you go home

337
00:25:33,734 --> 00:25:36,604
you tell your husband that you both need to go to therapy. Go.

338
00:25:36,949 --> 00:25:37,813
Go!

339
00:25:42,565 --> 00:25:44,512
I don't want you doing this anymore.

340
00:25:44,611 --> 00:25:48,134
You could've told me in private. Maybe spared the poor girl her feelings.

341
00:25:48,246 --> 00:25:52,092
No, no, no. I mean, I don't want you in the porn business anymore. Period.

342
00:25:52,331 --> 00:25:54,343
And I want you to stop selling those dolls.

343
00:25:54,468 --> 00:25:57,754
Do you realize how many men are boning you right now?

344
00:25:57,862 --> 00:26:00,409
I went online. Hundreds of those things have been sold.

345
00:26:00,541 --> 00:26:02,340
1,238.

346
00:26:02,494 --> 00:26:05,503
Each sale is $8,000 in my pocket, by the way.

347
00:26:05,613 --> 00:26:08,164
Well, now we're getting married, you don't need the money.

348
00:26:08,271 --> 00:26:10,141
But it's not about the money, Christian.

349
00:26:10,278 --> 00:26:13,364
This--this is about my career.

350
00:26:15,523 --> 00:26:18,074
How would you feel if I took a mold of my cock,

351
00:26:18,173 --> 00:26:21,596
passed it around south beach and called it a career?

352
00:26:22,709 --> 00:26:25,809
If you thought it was a solid business venture, I would let you.

353
00:26:25,918 --> 00:26:27,960
Now you're just full of shit.

354
00:26:28,722 --> 00:26:32,440
Well, at least I wouldn't be so uptight about it.

355
00:26:33,334 --> 00:26:35,461
And I would still love you.

356
00:26:36,407 --> 00:26:40,976
Knowing that all those other women are getting off because of me wouldn't bother you?

357
00:26:41,070 --> 00:26:44,292
I wouldn't have a problem with women objectifying you.

358
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,008
Please.

359
00:26:47,102 --> 00:26:50,374
What matters to me is that I see you for who you are.

360
00:26:50,472 --> 00:26:53,581
I think the problem here is that you don't see me.

361
00:26:53,687 --> 00:26:55,855
I'm not a doll, Christian.

362
00:26:55,906 --> 00:26:57,436
I'm not gonna let you treat me like one either.

363
00:26:57,540 --> 00:27:01,135
Well, I'm not spending the rest of my life married to a porn star!

364
00:27:01,378 --> 00:27:03,902
Well, no one is forcing you.

365
00:27:03,993 --> 00:27:06,849
Give up the porn business or give up the wedding.

366
00:27:07,138 --> 00:27:08,386
Your choice.

367
00:27:10,521 --> 00:27:11,675
Nice.

368
00:27:28,672 --> 00:27:31,737
I think that's it for the den if you want to seal that box up.

369
00:27:33,830 --> 00:27:36,291
We took this on Annie's birthday last year.

370
00:27:36,406 --> 00:27:37,918
You have a beautiful daughter.

371
00:27:38,519 --> 00:27:40,341
- How old?
- 9.

372
00:27:41,333 --> 00:27:44,482
Julia and I planned this big surprise party that year.

373
00:27:44,616 --> 00:27:47,140
We always loved planning parties for the kids.

374
00:27:49,259 --> 00:27:51,558
Are you sure you're ready to do this, Sean?

375
00:27:52,879 --> 00:27:54,584
Absolutely.

376
00:27:56,088 --> 00:27:58,341
Go get the tape and I'll seal this one up.

377
00:28:15,211 --> 00:28:16,407
You weren't answering your phone.

378
00:28:16,491 --> 00:28:18,790
I couldn't take the chance that you were avoiding my calls.

379
00:28:23,152 --> 00:28:24,404
Leaving again already?

380
00:28:24,975 --> 00:28:26,056
Where to this time?

381
00:28:26,230 --> 00:28:27,333
Not sure yet.

382
00:28:32,118 --> 00:28:33,152
Alone?

383
00:28:33,276 --> 00:28:36,479
I was going to call you. I've just been busy packing and I...

384
00:28:36,557 --> 00:28:37,970
You can't leave just yet.

385
00:28:38,467 --> 00:28:39,979
I need you in surgery.

386
00:28:40,091 --> 00:28:41,242
Right now.

387
00:28:42,747 --> 00:28:45,069
McNamara/Troy isn't my life anymore.

388
00:28:45,147 --> 00:28:48,798
I can't just run into surgery and assist. I'm in the middle of packing up my home.

389
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:51,635
And Quentin and I are in the middle of a facial transplant.

390
00:28:54,555 --> 00:28:56,781
We already removed the donor tissue.

391
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:59,134
We're operating in less than an hour.

392
00:28:59,237 --> 00:29:01,432
How did you get involved in an allotransplantation?

393
00:29:01,523 --> 00:29:03,085
I'll explain on the way.

394
00:29:03,189 --> 00:29:04,624
We don't have much time.

395
00:29:09,952 --> 00:29:13,969
Come on, Sean. I'm not asking you to rejoin the practice, for Christ's sake.

396
00:29:14,132 --> 00:29:16,130
I know this is hard for you, Christian.

397
00:29:16,368 --> 00:29:20,348
I've been either at your side or in the next room for every one of your surgeries,

398
00:29:20,431 --> 00:29:24,967
but you need to get used to having an identity as a doctor without me.

399
00:29:25,092 --> 00:29:29,057
Quentin is completely capable. More capable than I am for this surgery, as a matter of fact.

400
00:29:29,098 --> 00:29:31,452
Quentin is on drugs.

401
00:29:32,673 --> 00:29:35,106
He was high the whole way through the first surgery.

402
00:29:35,209 --> 00:29:37,459
He was jumpy, sweating bullets.

403
00:29:37,568 --> 00:29:38,914
Maybe he was just nervous.

404
00:29:39,905 --> 00:29:42,086
I've done a lot of blow in my day, Sean.

405
00:29:42,199 --> 00:29:45,123
I know the symptoms when somebody's doing too much.

406
00:29:48,565 --> 00:29:51,929
Ok, look. This isn't about me.

407
00:29:52,418 --> 00:29:54,685
It's about a patient. A young girl.

408
00:29:55,127 --> 00:29:56,517
She deserves to be more than just

409
00:29:56,543 --> 00:30:01,268
a failed ego-driven experiment written up in medical journals.

410
00:30:01,372 --> 00:30:02,875
You have a daughter.

411
00:30:03,355 --> 00:30:05,577
Think of it from her mother's perspective.

412
00:30:15,878 --> 00:30:17,277
You coming or what?

413
00:30:38,849 --> 00:30:40,254
Now what are you doing here?

414
00:30:40,375 --> 00:30:42,110
I asked him to assist.

415
00:30:42,707 --> 00:30:46,804
Sean has the most experience when it comes to micro-vascular anastomosis.

416
00:30:46,936 --> 00:30:50,499
We really should never have attempted this without him.

417
00:30:50,692 --> 00:30:52,375
This is a joke, right?

418
00:30:53,572 --> 00:30:57,075
Well, I appreciate the vote of confidence, Christian,

419
00:30:57,205 --> 00:31:00,880
but I told you, I am not gonna let anyone step in and finish what I started.

420
00:31:00,974 --> 00:31:03,787
I don't have to ask permission, Quentin. This is still my practice.

421
00:31:03,902 --> 00:31:06,520
That I've been running while you've been awol.

422
00:31:06,616 --> 00:31:08,356
Don't even try pulling rank on me, Sean.

423
00:31:08,458 --> 00:31:10,379
We're not gonna argue with you, Quentin.

424
00:31:11,123 --> 00:31:13,283
We're doing what's best for the patient.

425
00:31:15,795 --> 00:31:18,400
Things went so well earlier, why are you trying to blow this now?

426
00:31:18,493 --> 00:31:21,841
Speaking of blow, why were you so jumpy this afternoon?

427
00:31:22,301 --> 00:31:23,746
What are you talking about?

428
00:31:25,134 --> 00:31:27,758
I know what cocaine abuse looks like.

429
00:31:28,030 --> 00:31:29,416
You're not fooling anyone.

430
00:31:29,517 --> 00:31:33,107
And if anyone found out, you'd not only lose your license, we'd get sued for negligence.

431
00:31:33,205 --> 00:31:36,051
You could single-handedly destroy what's left of this practice.

432
00:31:37,130 --> 00:31:38,119
I see.

433
00:31:38,511 --> 00:31:40,635
Yeah, I see what's going on here.

434
00:31:40,779 --> 00:31:45,705
I bring in a surgical procedure that can re-invent this practice in an unprecedented way

435
00:31:45,795 --> 00:31:47,999
and you guys figure why not malign my reputation

436
00:31:48,088 --> 00:31:49,756
and take all the credit for yourself, is that it?

437
00:31:49,862 --> 00:31:51,454
That's bullshit, and it's not gonna work.

438
00:31:51,553 --> 00:31:52,755
Bullshit?

439
00:31:58,571 --> 00:32:00,866
Your pupils are dilated.

440
00:32:01,139 --> 00:32:02,570
Hold out your hand.

441
00:32:02,997 --> 00:32:03,996
So you can smack it.

442
00:32:04,097 --> 00:32:05,596
So I can see if it's shaky.

443
00:32:05,701 --> 00:32:07,797
She's been under for almost half an hour, guys.

444
00:32:07,895 --> 00:32:09,035
Can you hurry it up?

445
00:32:11,634 --> 00:32:13,390
You have 2 choices, Quentin.

446
00:32:13,495 --> 00:32:17,760
You can either leave and read about the surgery in the paper tomorrow with everyone else,

447
00:32:17,942 --> 00:32:19,954
or you can come in there and assist.

448
00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:27,644
We'll even let you pick out the music.

449
00:33:00,217 --> 00:33:02,826
Superficial temporal vessels look trashed.

450
00:33:03,185 --> 00:33:06,059
Let's start with the external carotid. Expose those first.

451
00:33:06,158 --> 00:33:07,282
Microscope.

452
00:33:19,243 --> 00:33:20,499
15 blade.

453
00:33:21,743 --> 00:33:22,699
Scissors.

454
00:33:40,816 --> 00:33:41,914
Clamp.

455
00:33:42,994 --> 00:33:43,842
You good?

456
00:33:44,694 --> 00:33:46,342
Take the microscope out.

457
00:33:53,765 --> 00:33:54,777
Thank you, nurse.

458
00:34:15,002 --> 00:34:16,931
Let's tie in the mitek screws.

459
00:34:40,876 --> 00:34:42,188
- You good?
- Yep.

460
00:35:24,282 --> 00:35:25,935
The flap fits perfectly.

461
00:35:27,190 --> 00:35:29,986
It's still not a face until you have some structure behind it.

462
00:35:30,468 --> 00:35:31,553
Bring the microscope.

463
00:36:01,686 --> 00:36:02,443
Glue.

464
00:36:02,970 --> 00:36:03,801
Glue.

465
00:36:39,196 --> 00:36:41,364
Let's put a light bandage on her, no pressure.

466
00:36:41,451 --> 00:36:43,543
The next 24 hours are the most critical.

467
00:36:47,433 --> 00:36:49,408
Why don't you go home, take a shower?

468
00:36:49,519 --> 00:36:51,530
We'll call you if there's any change.

469
00:37:09,846 --> 00:37:11,243
That was exhausting.

470
00:37:11,345 --> 00:37:12,088
Scary.

471
00:37:12,187 --> 00:37:13,150
Tedious.

472
00:37:13,286 --> 00:37:14,936
That's the most fun I've had in years.

473
00:37:21,523 --> 00:37:22,738
- Liz.
- Yeah?

474
00:37:23,567 --> 00:37:24,823
It's good to see you again.

475
00:37:25,228 --> 00:37:26,456
Good to see you.

476
00:37:31,323 --> 00:37:32,763
Thank you, Liz.

477
00:37:39,538 --> 00:37:41,976
And thank you, by the way.

478
00:37:42,501 --> 00:37:44,229
I couldn't have done it without you.

479
00:37:46,304 --> 00:37:48,220
You're not really leaving me again, are you?

480
00:37:48,430 --> 00:37:50,099
Sticking me with Quentin?

481
00:37:51,852 --> 00:37:54,559
You know I can't run this practice with him now.

482
00:37:56,054 --> 00:37:58,035
I guess you'll have to find a way.

483
00:38:14,965 --> 00:38:16,146
I'm coming.

484
00:38:21,676 --> 00:38:22,611
Hi.

485
00:38:24,598 --> 00:38:25,637
Can I come in?

486
00:38:25,797 --> 00:38:26,628
Nope.

487
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:29,434
Oh, I'm sorry. Is she not here yet?

488
00:38:29,562 --> 00:38:32,667
I thought our appointment was at 9:00, but maybe she did say 10:00.

489
00:38:32,763 --> 00:38:34,275
I'll call her right now.

490
00:38:40,137 --> 00:38:42,208
You know what? Don't bother.

491
00:38:42,685 --> 00:38:44,660
Why don't you just come in?

492
00:38:48,811 --> 00:38:50,508
She should be back soon.

493
00:38:54,276 --> 00:38:56,463
I'm sorry about what happened yesterday.

494
00:38:56,945 --> 00:38:59,649
Kimber told me how stressful your job can be.

495
00:39:00,026 --> 00:39:02,532
And I completely understood why you blew up.

496
00:39:02,928 --> 00:39:04,841
It's exciting, though, isn't it?

497
00:39:04,958 --> 00:39:07,526
I'm telling all my girlfriends about our workshops now.

498
00:39:09,196 --> 00:39:10,531
Workshops?

499
00:39:10,653 --> 00:39:13,518
Yeah. Bring out the porn star in you?

500
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:15,542
It's such a great idea.

501
00:39:15,673 --> 00:39:17,963
Very empowering for women, I think.

502
00:39:20,599 --> 00:39:26,675
You know, I was in surgery all night. I'm a little out of the loop.

503
00:39:26,788 --> 00:39:29,064
Oh, maybe she meant it as a surprise. I should have--

504
00:39:29,163 --> 00:39:31,641
No, no, no, no. She mentioned it before.

505
00:39:31,971 --> 00:39:34,320
I just wasn't listening.

506
00:39:34,684 --> 00:39:35,539
Tell me.

507
00:39:35,750 --> 00:39:39,170
Well, Kimber thought she'd sell the program in tandem with the doll.

508
00:39:39,299 --> 00:39:41,049
Women could sign up for these weekend workshops

509
00:39:41,135 --> 00:39:43,838
and learn all about how to be a porn star in the bedroom.

510
00:39:44,522 --> 00:39:47,320
It's a great way to spice up a marriage, don't you think?

511
00:39:49,327 --> 00:39:50,377
Definitely.

512
00:39:52,488 --> 00:39:59,683
And I think it's a great idea if I'm there to give some tips, as well.

513
00:40:01,505 --> 00:40:04,082
You said it yourself. Nobody knows Kimber

514
00:40:04,163 --> 00:40:06,984
better than the man who sleeps with the original.

515
00:40:07,081 --> 00:40:09,623
Right? So...

516
00:40:11,386 --> 00:40:14,006
why don't you show me what you've learned so far?

517
00:40:17,290 --> 00:40:22,374
Colleen, sweetheart, if you wanna be like Kimber, you can't be shy.

518
00:40:46,137 --> 00:40:47,321
Hey, baby.

519
00:40:48,471 --> 00:40:50,123
See anything you like?

520
00:40:53,597 --> 00:40:54,608
Wow.

521
00:40:56,105 --> 00:40:57,680
If I didn't know any better,

522
00:40:58,902 --> 00:40:59,955
I'd think you were Kimber.

523
00:40:59,977 --> 00:41:00,998
Really?

524
00:41:07,674 --> 00:41:09,186
You certainly fooled me.

525
00:41:20,740 --> 00:41:22,340
Do I kiss like her, too?

526
00:41:23,757 --> 00:41:24,928
Better.

527
00:41:35,136 --> 00:41:37,289
Now let's see how you taste.

528
00:41:59,349 --> 00:42:03,000
I figured I'd put the house on the market once we settle in the new location.

529
00:42:03,106 --> 00:42:04,748
Packing is pretty much done.

530
00:42:04,862 --> 00:42:07,091
We should be ready to leave in a day or so.

531
00:42:07,125 --> 00:42:12,992
Good. For now. I was hoping you could help me get a new driver's license.

532
00:42:15,185 --> 00:42:19,428
Nicole. Could you excuse Sean and me for a moment?

533
00:42:19,831 --> 00:42:23,242
Some security question I need for him to answer.

534
00:42:40,565 --> 00:42:41,878
Can I see your hands?

535
00:42:48,012 --> 00:42:50,362
Are you really serious about this, Sean?

536
00:42:50,477 --> 00:42:52,049
About joining the program?

537
00:42:52,498 --> 00:42:56,849
Because once I start the ball rolling, there won't be any going back to your old life.

538
00:42:56,965 --> 00:42:58,562
I understand that.

539
00:43:01,133 --> 00:43:05,756
So you understand that if you go on the run with Nikki,

540
00:43:06,895 --> 00:43:09,576
you will have made the same enemy she has.

541
00:43:10,523 --> 00:43:12,481
Just tell me what I have to do.

542
00:43:14,997 --> 00:43:19,421
All right. Well, first thing we have to do is get rid of your fingerprints.

543
00:43:19,569 --> 00:43:23,141
This is a diluted form of sulfuric acid.

544
00:43:23,513 --> 00:43:24,842
It might sting a bit.

545
00:43:41,495 --> 00:43:43,260
Why is this necessary?

546
00:43:43,954 --> 00:43:47,955
A new identity isn't just changing a driver's license.

547
00:43:48,176 --> 00:43:49,671
It's about death,

548
00:43:50,175 --> 00:43:52,762
killing what's left of the old you.

549
00:43:53,356 --> 00:43:57,337
Fingerprints are the most unique characteristic everyone has.

550
00:43:57,451 --> 00:44:03,432
In order to truly disappear, you'll have to lose yours, or risk leaving a trail.

551
00:44:13,381 --> 00:44:16,072
Wait. I can't do this.

552
00:44:16,198 --> 00:44:18,633
I'm a surgeon. I need my hands to work.

553
00:44:18,816 --> 00:44:19,712
If something goes wrong-

554
00:44:19,807 --> 00:44:22,178
You can't be a surgeon anymore, Sean.

555
00:44:22,346 --> 00:44:23,863
You'll have to give that up, too.

556
00:44:23,958 --> 00:44:25,781
Why can't I practice medicine?

557
00:44:26,591 --> 00:44:30,403
You use your medical license to get a job, you leave another trail.

558
00:44:30,521 --> 00:44:31,849
It's too dangerous.

559
00:44:32,935 --> 00:44:34,155
What am I supposed to do?

560
00:44:34,271 --> 00:44:35,765
I'm not trained for anything else.

561
00:44:35,875 --> 00:44:42,536
There's always a car salesman, U.P.S. delivery man, entry-level stuff.

562
00:44:42,627 --> 00:44:45,348
Well, I can't support a family on that kind of pay cut.

563
00:44:45,432 --> 00:44:48,606
Your family isn't there for you anymore, Sean.

564
00:44:49,260 --> 00:44:53,508
You get back in touch with them, even sending the money anonymously,

565
00:44:53,601 --> 00:44:55,443
you leave another trail.

566
00:44:55,944 --> 00:44:58,315
You'll be putting everyone at risk.

567
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:06,034
I can never see any of them again?

568
00:45:08,879 --> 00:45:12,197
If you wanna do what's best for you and Nikki,

569
00:45:12,300 --> 00:45:16,080
you're gonna have to say good-bye to somebody

570
00:45:16,796 --> 00:45:18,145
forever.

571
00:46:36,472 --> 00:46:38,163
My baby.

572
00:46:54,228 --> 00:46:56,011
Blood flow seems strong.

573
00:46:59,858 --> 00:47:01,600
There's no sign of infection.

574
00:47:08,124 --> 00:47:09,302
We're stable.

575
00:47:21,533 --> 00:47:26,249
Ms. Manning, I don't think now is the best time.

576
00:47:26,363 --> 00:47:29,386
No, please. Let her come in.

577
00:47:33,492 --> 00:47:35,770
This is her daughter, too.

578
00:47:52,707 --> 00:47:54,008
We did it.

579
00:47:57,389 --> 00:47:58,372
Thank you.

580
00:48:00,814 --> 00:48:01,688
Thank you.

581
00:48:23,937 --> 00:48:25,860
I tried the front door, but nobody answered.

582
00:48:25,917 --> 00:48:29,329
Oh, I just got out of the shower. I'm running late for work.

583
00:48:29,427 --> 00:48:30,947
What are you doing here?

584
00:48:32,011 --> 00:48:33,752
Just came by to...

585
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,594
see how you were doing.

586
00:48:38,127 --> 00:48:41,166
Oh, um, coffee?

587
00:48:50,928 --> 00:48:52,424
How does this look?

588
00:48:52,601 --> 00:48:55,225
My outfit. It's new.

589
00:48:56,789 --> 00:48:58,143
It looks great.

590
00:48:58,420 --> 00:49:01,008
I spent way too much money on it.

591
00:49:03,437 --> 00:49:05,201
Business must be going good then.

592
00:49:05,303 --> 00:49:07,148
Oh, it couldn't be better.

593
00:49:07,882 --> 00:49:12,770
Actually, I learned a lot from you, about how run a tight ship.

594
00:49:12,872 --> 00:49:14,553
You were always good at that.

595
00:49:21,364 --> 00:49:23,034
Is Annie still here?

596
00:49:23,205 --> 00:49:25,884
No. Matt took her to rehearsal.

597
00:49:27,969 --> 00:49:31,892
She has that solo in the school musical, remember?

598
00:49:34,918 --> 00:49:37,824
She's been practicing for three months.

599
00:49:37,965 --> 00:49:40,355
You are coming to the show next week?

600
00:49:42,194 --> 00:49:43,756
Absolutely.

601
00:49:44,969 --> 00:49:47,046
I wouldn't miss it for the world.

602
00:49:48,079 --> 00:49:49,916
Oh, my watch. Excuse me.

603
00:49:58,618 --> 00:49:59,680
Come in.

604
00:50:09,251 --> 00:50:10,650
What are you doing here?

605
00:50:11,113 --> 00:50:14,678
I thought you'd be out somewhere turning housewives into happy hookers.

606
00:50:15,538 --> 00:50:17,518
Colleen cancelled her appointment.

607
00:50:17,640 --> 00:50:19,220
Said she didn't need me anymore.

608
00:50:19,328 --> 00:50:20,975
All her problems were over.

609
00:50:21,181 --> 00:50:24,130
She seemed very happy when I left her.

610
00:50:25,326 --> 00:50:27,364
Just in case you're curious,

611
00:50:27,724 --> 00:50:31,034
married women do have the best sex.

612
00:50:31,347 --> 00:50:33,703
Too bad you'll never get a chance to test that theory.

613
00:50:33,791 --> 00:50:35,452
I know you slept with her, Christian.

614
00:50:35,549 --> 00:50:37,639
I could tell by the tone of your voice.

615
00:50:38,518 --> 00:50:41,423
It's the same one I have after having three orgasms.

616
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:45,522
4. She really couldn't get enough.

617
00:50:45,618 --> 00:50:47,725
Well, it's just like I taught her.

618
00:50:49,897 --> 00:50:51,900
At first I was pissed.

619
00:50:52,126 --> 00:50:58,452
But then I figured if hundreds of men can use my doll to get off four times a day,

620
00:50:58,601 --> 00:51:02,820
you screwing one Kimber wannabe isn't the end of the world.

621
00:51:03,264 --> 00:51:04,998
Was kind of flattered, actually.

622
00:51:05,094 --> 00:51:08,548
I mean you cheated on me, but with me.

623
00:51:08,911 --> 00:51:11,697
So I can screw all your graduates now?

624
00:51:14,139 --> 00:51:16,098
I'm not gonna do it anymore.

625
00:51:18,326 --> 00:51:20,905
I've decided to give up porn.

626
00:51:23,044 --> 00:51:25,762
I wanna be your wife, Christian.

627
00:51:26,014 --> 00:51:30,263
That means more to me than being some video director.

628
00:51:51,670 --> 00:51:53,675
Not so fast.

629
00:52:04,584 --> 00:52:05,998
A prenup?

630
00:52:06,288 --> 00:52:08,147
It's a fidelity prenup.

631
00:52:08,319 --> 00:52:10,341
I had my lawyers draw it up.

632
00:52:11,686 --> 00:52:14,981
It states that after the wedding, we agree on two things, ok?

633
00:52:15,078 --> 00:52:17,032
No more porn for me

634
00:52:17,428 --> 00:52:20,597
and no more affairs for you.

635
00:52:21,296 --> 00:52:24,362
I'm still a business woman with assets, you know?

636
00:52:24,498 --> 00:52:26,847
I've got a reputation to protect.

637
00:52:27,933 --> 00:52:32,296
Oh, don't worry, there's a clause in there that still allows for threesomes.

638
00:52:32,867 --> 00:52:36,358
Well, I don't wanna kill our sex life just because we're getting married either.

639
00:53:01,005 --> 00:53:06,580
Tell me, was she anywhere near as good as I am?

640
00:53:08,823 --> 00:53:12,299
Nothing is better than the original, baby.

641
00:53:33,332 --> 00:53:37,465
Wow. He did a really nice job.

642
00:53:38,143 --> 00:53:40,417
The doctor who did your face. I like the new look.

643
00:53:40,523 --> 00:53:42,023
How did you find me?

644
00:53:42,820 --> 00:53:45,769
Just because you change your face don't mean you disappear.

645
00:53:48,169 --> 00:53:50,911
You really do look like a whole new person.

646
00:53:53,836 --> 00:53:56,356
Except you've got the same rat eyes.

647
00:54:00,889 --> 00:54:02,461
Sorry, sweetie.

648
00:54:02,582 --> 00:54:05,009
I ain't as slow as your dead husband.

649
00:54:17,925 --> 00:54:19,843
You don't need to do this.

650
00:54:20,308 --> 00:54:22,997
This is the part of my job I really enjoy.

651
00:54:23,250 --> 00:54:24,411
Please.

652
00:54:28,788 --> 00:54:30,898
I love it when they beg, too.

653
00:54:43,467 --> 00:54:44,737
Here's a question.

654
00:54:44,989 --> 00:54:49,004
Do you think that in heaven you and Austin will both look like you do now,

655
00:54:49,121 --> 00:54:51,243
or how you looked before the surgery?

656
00:54:54,710 --> 00:54:55,872
My son.

657
00:54:56,407 --> 00:54:58,014
Please don't hurt him.

658
00:54:58,169 --> 00:54:59,534
It's too late.

659
00:55:39,770 --> 00:55:40,688
Nikki?

660
00:55:40,844 --> 00:55:42,280
Sean, it's Christian.

661
00:55:42,431 --> 00:55:43,810
We have a problem.

662
00:55:46,927 --> 00:55:48,692
We did the best we could, Sean.

663
00:55:49,289 --> 00:55:51,828
The vascular reattachments were flawless.

664
00:55:52,532 --> 00:55:55,075
Her body just rejected the tissue.

665
00:55:55,689 --> 00:55:59,281
I wonder what it would've felt like growing up with someone else's face.

666
00:55:59,426 --> 00:56:02,497
See a complete stranger every time you looked in the mirror.

667
00:56:02,612 --> 00:56:05,975
Well, if we want to spin this in our favor,

668
00:56:06,101 --> 00:56:09,053
at least we can say she's still alive.

669
00:56:12,559 --> 00:56:16,067
I can't find any music that feels appropriate right now.

670
00:56:16,765 --> 00:56:18,077
That's fine.

671
00:56:18,245 --> 00:56:19,929
We need to concentrate.

672
00:56:21,207 --> 00:56:22,391
Scissors.

673
00:56:53,707 --> 00:56:55,991
