1
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:02,189
Previously on Nip / Tuck...

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:05,431
He's making such a good recovery,
I'm thinking about calling Dr. Mugavi.

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:08,159
Move up the target date
for the operation on his other hand.

4
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:13,633
Julie and I have an intimacy that goes
beyond just employer and employee.

5
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:15,472
Are you having an affair with my wife?

6
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:17,232
You banged the nanny,
now your guilty conscience

7
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:18,673
is making you think
she's banging the nanny.

8
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:21,115
Marlowe and I had an affair.

9
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:22,315
Why would you, with him?

10
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:25,915
He accepted Conor
before he was even born,

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,275
and all you wanted to do was change him!

12
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:30,555
I had an affair with Monica.

13
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:36,319
Why now?

14
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:40,518
The age of consent for your surgery is 18,
that was two years ago.

15
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:43,633
I don't know.

16
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:48,032
I wasn't in college yet then and
didn't really know what I wanted to do.

17
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:51,271
Now, I'm pretty sure I wanna be a doctor.

18
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,157
Surgeon. Like my dad.

19
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:57,395
And, well, you know.

20
00:00:58,400 --> 00:00:59,913
Anything else?

21
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,514
I went to an all boys' prep school,

22
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:08,997
and there are a lot of girls at my college.

23
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:12,635
My mom always told me

24
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:16,759
that people would love me
for my big green eyes and my good heart.

25
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:19,351
But I've come to realize girls also like it

26
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:22,273
when you can unhook their bras
by yourself.

27
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:26,474
So why come to see me?
You seemed to have it all figured out.

28
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:31,918
As soon as I scheduled my surgery,
I started having nightmares.

29
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:34,638
About my parents.

30
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,314
They split up when I was just a baby.

31
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:40,079
I guess I never really thought about it.

32
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:43,675
I mean, I just always knew them
as two separate entities,

33
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:47,078
like Africa and South America.

34
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,595
They were these two huge land masses,
separated by an ocean,

35
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:57,037
but, one day, someone tells you
that they used to be one big continent,

36
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:00,437
and you start to see the places
where they...

37
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:04,554
You know, where they broke apart.

38
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,717
I'm not following.

39
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,992
I was six months old.

40
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:16,479
What makes a couple that's been married
for almost 20 years break up,

41
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,154
when they have a six-month-old baby?

42
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:21,551
So you wanna know for sure
why they divorced?

43
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:25,110
I wanna feel whole and normal
in every way possible and,

44
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:28,638
surgery or not,

45
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,589
I don't think I can until I know the truth.

46
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,796
You were just a baby then.

47
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:37,917
Even if you were the focus
for your parents' issues,

48
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,718
you weren't responsible.

49
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,677
But it's still a part of who I am.

50
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,512
It's like another handicap.

51
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:50,992
Look, all I want is to be able
to walk into a room one day,

52
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:52,638
hold my hand out proudly and say,

53
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:56,076
"Hi. I'm Conor McNamara. "

54
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:45,474
Do you have any memories at all
of your parents splitting up?

55
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:48,593
Sometimes images or words
can be recalled

56
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:52,309
from traumatic experiences
that occurred during infancy.

57
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,438
Maybe I blocked it all out.

58
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:56,272
What about your siblings?

59
00:03:56,360 --> 00:04:00,148
Did your sister or brother
ever tell you what they remember?

60
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:06,114
Matt wasn't around much.

61
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:09,033
Ann always says it was one hell of a week.

62
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:13,994
There was a hurricane or something,
back when they were rare.

63
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:18,000
She always talks about that hurricane.

64
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:20,958
With winds already topping
105 miles an hour,

65
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:24,669
it looks like Lenore is on her way
to becoming a category-three hurricane

66
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:27,593
before her western edge makes landfall
over the Bahamas

67
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,511
sometime early tomorrow.

68
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,592
And with the warm Gulf Stream waters
in her path,

69
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,870
it's very possible
Lenore could well strengthen

70
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,997
to become a category-four
or maybe even five

71
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:41,635
before it hits Miami head-on
Thursday morning.

72
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:44,359
Frankly, this could be one
of the worst storms we've seen

73
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:46,670
since Hurricane Andrew, folks.

74
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:59,833
Hurricane Lenore.
Sounds like an old-maid aunt

75
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:02,639
that's coming to town to kick your ass.

76
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,310
What about Conor's surgery?

77
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,913
It's not until the end of the week.

78
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,356
There could be a power outage
in the middle of the operation.

79
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:14,238
We have extra generators. We'll be fine.

80
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,630
I've got it under control.

81
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,669
Why haven't you asked me about Monica?

82
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:27,591
What I did? Why I did it?

83
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,591
I know why you did it.

84
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:32,911
The same reason
that I had an affair with Marlowe.

85
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,710
- I want to talk about it.
- I already know all the answers.

86
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,639
So do you.

87
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:46,069
We have to shore up the house tomorrow.
Put on the hurricane shutters.

88
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:49,550
If it's a category five like they said

89
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,356
and it's a direct hit,

90
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,318
then it's all gone with the wind anyway.

91
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,439
Storms blow over.

92
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:01,796
Sometimes you get lucky and you ride out
the winds and the terrible damage,

93
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:03,393
and you survive.

94
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:05,471
The sun comes out the next day,

95
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:08,279
and you forget how afraid you were
of losing everything.

96
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:11,955
It's all just a bad dream.

97
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,989
Florence is all about color and light.

98
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:21,275
It's what inspired me to become an artist.

99
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,079
How old were you
when you first went there?

100
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:28,790
I was about Annie's age.
My parents took us on a tour of Italy.

101
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:32,190
Once we got to Florence,
something happened to me.

102
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:38,597
Julia, it's where the Renaissance began.
It's the birthplace of humanism in art.

103
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:43,071
You can't avoid it, the whole city
is infused with beauty and clarity.

104
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,558
I have a feeling even Conor's gonna feel it.

105
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:49,315
By the way,
we need to buy him some warmer clothes.

106
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,277
The fall can be chilly.

107
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,828
I can shop for him next week.

108
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,709
We're gonna have to meet you there

109
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:00,917
in a month or so
as soon as Conor's able to fly.

110
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:06,992
I've decided to let Sean go ahead
and operate on his other hand.

111
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,719
Please, just don't look at me like that.

112
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,553
I mean he's his father. I can't just...

113
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:16,272
It's his dream for his son.

114
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:19,557
His dream is misguided and invasive,
you know that!

115
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:21,039
I know that you're angry with me,

116
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,315
but please,
just try and see it through my eyes.

117
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:26,472
Julia, yeah, I'm angry,
but mostly I'm disappointed in you.

118
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,675
Conor can't defend himself

119
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:31,435
from his father's obsession
with creating a perfect son.

120
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:35,274
It's an illusion. It's an ego trip.
It's harmful.

121
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,875
- The world you people live in, it's just...
- It's what?

122
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,714
Go on, Marlowe, say it. It's what?

123
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:48,112
If you're not his advocate, he's got no one.

124
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:53,748
Oh, my God, I am literally torn in pieces.

125
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,718
Everywhere I turn, I'm betraying someone.

126
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,879
I can't bear to torture Conor,

127
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:05,191
and I cannot bear to hurt Sean.

128
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,953
And I can't bear to lose your respect.

129
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:12,115
So what am I supposed to do?

130
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,798
Don't you think
you're over-packing a little?

131
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:48,156
Conor is only going to be
in recovery overnight.

132
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:52,836
He's not having the surgery, Sean.
He and Annie are coming with me.

133
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:55,036
You think I'm gonna
let you take my kids away from me?

134
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,712
I'll fight you with everything I have.

135
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,995
And ruin their lives in the process?

136
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:01,435
Once again I'm the one who has to suffer?

137
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:03,829
- The burden always has to be on me.
- Sean, stop it.

138
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:06,718
- You screwed Marlowe!
- You screwed Monica!

139
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:09,678
And it shouldn't take us
having to hurting each other like that

140
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:13,799
to realize that
we just don't belong together anymore.

141
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:15,108
Why him?

142
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,510
I understand you cheating on me.
Did you have to humiliate me, too?

143
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:21,637
You can forgive me for sleeping
with your best friend,

144
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:24,518
but you can't handle the fact
that I made love to a man

145
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:27,876
who looks different,
who's somehow imperfect.

146
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:30,349
I can handle imperfection, Julia.

147
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:33,955
Is that why you're so desperate
to operate on your son?

148
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:40,151
80% of your day
is spent making people look better,

149
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,959
as if it was gonna somehow
make them feel better, as well.

150
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,110
Yeah, that 80% paid for this house.

151
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,475
God, it did more than pay
for this house, Sean.

152
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:50,791
It seeped into its foundation,
the furniture, us.

153
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,674
It's a poison.

154
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:56,631
I know that being
with Marlowe was wrong,

155
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:02,078
but it opened my eyes
to how consumed I am with appearances.

156
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:05,318
It has eaten away at me like a cancer.

157
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:18,276
Julia, you just need
to express your feelings

158
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,799
about Monica,

159
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,515
about how I've neglected you.

160
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:29,510
Remember when you were so mad at me
that you threw one of these at my head?

161
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,637
Yeah, I was angry at you then, Sean.

162
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:35,393
But I'm not angry anymore.

163
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:36,993
I'm just done.

164
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,672
Well, I'm not!

165
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:49,077
Don't leave me, please. Don't do it.

166
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:59,111
We only got back together
because I was pregnant.

167
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:03,040
Conor is a gift,

168
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:06,430
and this is the price
we have to pay for having him.

169
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,878
Hurricane Lenore has mostly traveled
north ofPuerto Rico

170
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:44,270
and the southern Caribbean,
just the outer bands crossing those areas,

171
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:46,351
and they seem
to ha ve survived unscathed.

172
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:48,590
But she has just been devastating
to the smaller eastern islands.

173
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:51,035
Honey, did you move all the stuff away

174
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,031
from the windows in your room
like I asked?

175
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:56,430
What's it matter? I'm not going
to be sleeping in there anymore anyway.

176
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:59,478
Well, that's not true. I'm not leaving.

177
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:01,198
This will still be your home.

178
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:03,236
Your room can stay just the way
you want it.

179
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:06,392
And the storm is growing
as it heads westward for Miami

180
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:10,678
at a speed of 15 knots and
the best track has it making a direct hit.

181
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:13,558
The National Hurricane
Forecasting Center forecasting

182
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:16,791
that Lenore will become
a category-five within the next hour.

183
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:17,995
Winds of...

184
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:21,353
At least you get the day off
from school, huh?

185
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,396
Is this going to be like last time?

186
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:27,029
When Mom moved out
but you asked her to come back again?

187
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,756
I don't think so, Annie.

188
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:36,432
- Is it my fault, Dad?
- No.

189
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:39,597
Absolutely not.

190
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:41,598
Your mom and I...

191
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:47,717
We just grew apart.

192
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,870
Then it's because of Conor.

193
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:54,635
Maybe he can live with Mom
and I can stay here with you.

194
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:58,872
...storm surge of 15 to 20 feet.

195
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:03,192
It's time to pack up your essentials,
your prescriptions, and get out.

196
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:07,239
The mandatory evacuation begins
at 3:00 this afternoon for...

197
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:13,752
...highway as much as possible
before 3:00.

198
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:14,875
It's gonna be crowded,

199
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:18,157
and it's simply not the place
you'll want to get stranded.

200
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:22,149
Hi.

201
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:26,599
It is not getting any better out there,
that's for sure.

202
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,389
We should probably get going.
The roads are murder.

203
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,118
Where's your suitcase?

204
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,032
We're not going.

205
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:41,513
Julia, there's a mandatory evacuation.
Everyone has to go.

206
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:45,115
I know. And we are, just not with you.

207
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,751
- What are you talking about?
- I'm sorry.

208
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:51,515
I thought it was the right thing to do,
and it's not,

209
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,038
and I was wrong.

210
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,272
Oh, no, no, no. You're not wrong.

211
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,430
You're just under
a tremendous amount of stress right now.

212
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:01,954
I mean, I can only imagine
how unsettled you feel.

213
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:03,519
You just need me to take care of you.

214
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:06,876
Actually, I need to take care of myself.

215
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:10,669
And the only way that
I know how to do that is to be on my own.

216
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,029
Julia...

217
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:16,477
I have spent my whole life
depending on others for security.

218
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,152
Christian, Sean.

219
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:22,153
I am never going to be strong enough
to survive this moment in my life

220
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,753
if I don't do it on my own.

221
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:26,513
Is it... Is it Florence?
I mean, we don't have to go Florence.

222
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:29,194
No, no, no. It's not about Florence.

223
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,468
What is it? Is it my size?

224
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:36,158
God, you don't have to explain.
It's always like this.

225
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:39,994
It's fine for a while
and then the novelty wears off.

226
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,595
I thought we loved each other.

227
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:46,511
I do love you.

228
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:53,192
And I love you for allowing me
to be this imperfect woman.

229
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,355
But you're not in love with me.

230
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:05,877
What we have now
is a shared love for Conor.

231
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,597
And that's all we have.

232
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,873
I'm gonna go...

233
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:19,957
I'm gonna say goodbye to Conor, then go.

234
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:28,479
Hey, buddy.

235
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,595
It'll pass. It's just weather.

236
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:39,593
You've already been through a lot worse,

237
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:42,988
and you were a brave soldier, weren't you?

238
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:46,314
One day this will all be a distant memory.

239
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:48,436
You'll have your own life,

240
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:53,079
and you won't be at the mercy of storms
you don't understand.

241
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:04,235
It's been an honor to know you.

242
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:14,715
I've had to say goodbye a lot in this job,

243
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:17,268
but this one... This one's a bear.

244
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:21,278
I guess
we're all taking this one kind of hard.

245
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,790
- Thunder scaring him?
- Yeah.

246
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:27,392
What are you doing here?

247
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:30,315
I came to say goodbye to Conor.

248
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:33,911
Well, you better say it and go. The rain's
starting to come down in sheets.

249
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:39,358
Yeah, well,
I also wanted to apologize to you, Sean.

250
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:44,274
I'm sorry I lied about Julia and me.

251
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:49,556
I guess I wanted her to be the one
to tell you, but I shouldn't have lied.

252
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:52,552
And for what it's worth,
I think you're a good man.

253
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:54,119
I envy you.

254
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:58,554
And I'm really gonna miss your son.

255
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:05,872
Goodbye, Julia.

256
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:07,518
Goodbye, Conor.

257
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,154
Marlowe.

258
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:15,510
You've been a great friend to my son.
I'm sure he'll miss you.

259
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:20,795
I hope you'll feel free down the line
to stay in his life.

260
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:37,631
What happened to Marlowe?

261
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,232
We're still close, actually.

262
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,356
He took me to my first museum,

263
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:45,352
gives me advice on girls,
that kind of thing.

264
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:49,353
I'm close with his son, Zack, too.
He's just a year younger than me.

265
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,590
When I was 10,

266
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:58,035
I realized
that I didn't have any godparents.

267
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:01,157
In the midst of the divorce,
they kind of forgot to name them.

268
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:04,789
So I asked
if Marlowe could be my godfather.

269
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:07,751
Demanded it, actually.

270
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:10,512
They said yes.

271
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:12,636
I'm afraid our time is up.

272
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:17,911
No! I mean, I don't feel any better.

273
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:20,592
My operation is just two days away,

274
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:23,592
and I don't feel that anything is resolved.

275
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,912
Conor, maybe the thing you need to do

276
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,197
is to talk to your family
about how you feel, not just me.

277
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:35,715
You mean, ask them to sit down
and actually communicate together?

278
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:38,913
Yeah, that's hilarious.

279
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:44,715
I told you. My parents hate each other.

280
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:47,830
They'll never go for that.

281
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:49,239
How do you know
unless you present them

282
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:51,197
with the opportunity?

283
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:58,633
My spirit guides told me

284
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:02,235
that I'm not in the right place
to start a relationship right now.

285
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:04,993
Last night, I took a meditation pill.

286
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:08,277
They told me
I have too much emotional baggage.

287
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:11,511
What's my baggage? Where do I begin?

288
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:12,715
Let's start with the fact

289
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:16,270
that my mother flushed my pet gerbil,
Frisky I, down the toilet.

290
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:17,793
And did I also tell you

291
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:21,395
that she shamed me into having a party
to celebrate my first period?

292
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:23,869
I still get panic attacks
whenever I use a tampon.

293
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:25,757
Annie, get off the phone.

294
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:27,193
Pat, I have to go.

295
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:30,113
Julia beckons. I'll call you later.

296
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:34,075
Sweetheart, please call me Mom.

297
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:37,718
I know I don't care
how convenient those phone chips are,

298
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:40,519
I refuse to get one installed in my ear.

299
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:43,876
There's no red meat here.
You know I need my iron.

300
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:46,349
There is iron in fish, sweetheart,

301
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:48,158
and Conor needs his omega-threes

302
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:50,674
so that he can heal faster
after his surgery.

303
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:55,038
Oh, and, of course, his surgery
is more important than my anemia.

304
00:19:55,120 --> 00:20:00,478
Just like his hands were more important
than my bulimia or my agoraphobia or...

305
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:02,198
Ann, can we please have just one dinner

306
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:04,032
without talking
about your damn agoraphobia?

307
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:07,032
You refused to get off the couch
for a week because that guy dumped you.

308
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,473
That's not agoraphobia.

309
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:10,471
It's not all about you.

310
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:16,395
Why are we sitting alone
at this huge table?

311
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:19,756
Is it a metaphor for the chasm
that separates our family?

312
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:22,718
No, I was just saving seats
for your spirit guides.

313
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:29,118
Oh, my God.

314
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:34,874
- What is she doing here?
- I'm sorry, Dad.

315
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,154
I knew neither of you would come

316
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:37,559
if you knew the other one
was gonna be here.

317
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:38,834
You were right.

318
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:42,674
That's right, Sean. Walk out.
It's what you do best.

319
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:44,318
I never left you, Annie.

320
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,436
The fact is your mother walked out
on me, twice.

321
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:48,397
Dad, please, listen.

322
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:52,519
I know this is hard, but stay, for me.

323
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,833
I want you all
to meet my surgeon together.

324
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:06,320
So, how's your wife?

325
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:09,918
I'd rather not discuss my personal life,
thank you.

326
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,436
Look, we stopped trying to be friends
15 years ago.

327
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:15,957
Why start again now?

328
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:19,951
Why hasn't your surgeon called me?
I practically invented this surgery.

329
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:22,554
The New England Journal ofMedicine
did no less than three articles

330
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:25,438
on the microsurgery techniques
I used to fix your other hand.

331
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:28,080
He said he wanted
to discuss it with you personally.

332
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:29,673
He's very impressed with you, Dad.

333
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:31,478
Impressed?

334
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:33,516
He must not know him very well.

335
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:38,318
Oh, look at you. Look at you!

336
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:39,829
Hey.

337
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:45,035
Hey.

338
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:53,953
- Conor.
- Hey.

339
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,469
Seanie.

340
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:57,878
Who are your friends?

341
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:00,997
This is Delara and Nastran.

342
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:03,711
We met a month ago in Dubai.

343
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:06,917
Can't speak a word of English,
and they only love me for my money,

344
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,833
but they don't quit
until the Super Viagra wears off,

345
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:12,036
so who gives a shit?

346
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:14,715
Pee-pee.

347
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,358
- Pee-pee?
- Yeah.

348
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:18,237
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Go pee-pee.

349
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:20,629
Oh, my beautiful little dolly.

350
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:24,552
Well, thank God
for the polygamy amendment.

351
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:26,312
You can marry them both.

352
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:30,198
I don't think I'll ever
go down that road again.

353
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:33,114
Just doesn't seem right, you know?

354
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:37,795
Besides, this way I don't feel guilty
when I'm cheating.

355
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:41,233
You know, I think it's shameful
that you can marry two women,

356
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:44,949
but two gay men
still can't get married in this country.

357
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:47,474
The gays should
consider themselves lucky.

358
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,274
This is bullshit.

359
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:51,590
Okay, your son invited you here
to make nice.

360
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:53,511
Now you two make nice.

361
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:02,194
Your hair looks pretty.
It's nice that you're not coloring it.

362
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:06,432
Julia, your turn.

363
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:10,435
- Are you still jogging?
- Yeah.

364
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:12,830
I had a synovial replacement.

365
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:17,869
It shows. You look good, you know, fit.

366
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:32,680
So, Conor, we're all here, we made nice.

367
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:34,839
Now what?

368
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:38,719
I don't know.

369
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:42,156
We haven't all been together
in the same room since I was five.

370
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:44,117
I'm kind of just taking it all in.

371
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:47,237
Just so you all know,
I had an abortion last week.

372
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:51,074
- Hey, everybody.
- Mattie!

373
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:52,479
- Hey!
- Get over here!

374
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:56,758
- You look good.
- Thanks.

375
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:59,274
I thought you were still in Lhasa
with Doctors Without Borders.

376
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:01,920
Yeah, I was, but I came home early.

377
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:05,074
Hey.

378
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:06,715
Home early.

379
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:10,153
- How come?
- What? Conor didn't tell you?

380
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:14,997
I'm performing his surgery.

381
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:27,155
You need to go.

382
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:30,312
The storm's gonna hit within the hour.
You heard the TV.

383
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:32,272
- It's too late, Dad.
- It's not too late.

384
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:34,112
Your mother and the kids
went with Kimber to the shelter.

385
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:35,428
You go be with them.

386
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:37,351
They closed the roads, Dad.

387
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:39,351
Dad, look, please, just stop drinking.

388
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:42,716
Go to hell.
Even if I wanted to, I couldn't go.

389
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:45,356
There's a leak here, you see, God damn it?

390
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:48,432
I worked too hard to build this house.
I'm not going to let it...

391
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:51,990
The only thing I have left
just blow away with the winds!

392
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:55,835
- Hey, hey, hey.
- I gotta...

393
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:58,957
Look, we will weather this out together.

394
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:01,715
But we need to get into a room
with no windows.

395
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:04,792
- I gotta get this.
- No, Dad, we need to go now.

396
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:08,475
No, you get out of my house!
You go, be with your family!

397
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:11,430
Hold them, protect them!

398
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:13,511
Don't screw it up like I did.

399
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:16,192
- Dad.
- No, go, get out, leave!

400
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:18,669
- Go!
- I'm not leaving you alone.

401
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:26,071
I'm never gonna leave you.
I'm never gonna leave you.

402
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:29,837
So nerves on the fourth digit
look slightly more radial.

403
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:31,831
Just make sure we're prepared.

404
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:34,958
And you've done
the transdermal digital nerve mapping?

405
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:37,554
Yes, Dad, everything seems normal.

406
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:39,312
All right, thanks, Janet.

407
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,070
Sorry, just trying to help.

408
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:49,955
I won't be around
once you get into surgery.

409
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:53,396
I'm on call back at the office.
They paged me with an emergency.

410
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:55,710
Wait a minute. You're leaving?

411
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:11,958
How long are you planning on staying?
Looks like you're moving in.

412
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:16,588
These make it feel more like home.

413
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:20,951
- Oh, look it.
- Oh, yeah.

414
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:25,076
That's the only photo I have
where we're all together.

415
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:30,357
Why didn't you ask your father
to do the surgery?

416
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,516
I thought it would upset you.

417
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:35,828
Don't be so upset, Matt.

418
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:38,673
You're running out on him again.
On all of us.

419
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:40,113
I'm on call.

420
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:42,191
Why don't you just admit
what's really going on?

421
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:45,078
You want to leave because
Conor didn't ask you to do the surgery.

422
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:48,596
I would have been fine
if your father had done the surgery.

423
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:49,715
Why wouldn't I be?

424
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:53,952
Because, Mom, look, even though
you've always wanted me to,

425
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:58,750
I've never accepted my own handicap.

426
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,718
And so by asking Dad to do the surgery,

427
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:04,190
it would've looked like I was
choosing him over you now and it's...

428
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:05,429
Is that what you think?

429
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:09,235
Conor's never forgiven me for the divorce.

430
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,718
And I understand.

431
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:13,552
If I had kept the marriage together,

432
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:15,676
I could have fixed both his hands
the first time.

433
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:17,512
Maybe if I was born
with two perfect hands,

434
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,079
you and Dad would have stayed together.

435
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:21,628
Oh, honey.

436
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:29,796
Your father and I had our problems
long before you were born.

437
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:34,192
What happened 20 years ago,
it had nothing to do with you.

438
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:37,955
This has nothing to do with you.
Don't turn it into that.

439
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:40,838
I wish I would've heard
you say that earlier, Mom.

440
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:47,755
Mom, Conor.
I'd like you to meet my boyfriend, Ahmet.

441
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:50,788
Just so you know, Ahmet's bisexual.

442
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:53,870
Does anyone have any credits
for the vending machine?

443
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:55,632
I'm getting a headache
from a lack of sugar.

444
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:58,439
Well, maybe you should
eat some protein first, honey.

445
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:02,308
Why don't we go across the street
and grab something to eat?

446
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:04,750
- You stay here and rest.
- Yeah.

447
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:11,876
I have to say I admire Julia's decision
not to have any work done.

448
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:14,554
I agree. Looking real suits some women.

449
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:18,997
Hey, what did the cardiologist say?
No tatertots or any fried foams.

450
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:21,275
- Stop it.
- Christian!

451
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:23,430
I'm not ready to lose my partner
to heart disease.

452
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:25,351
I'm not going anywhere, pal.

453
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:29,395
Speaking of which,
did you book your flight to Beijing

454
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:32,233
for the opening of
the new McNamara/Troy?

455
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:33,628
The girls and I are leaving early

456
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:36,678
so we can spend a few days
in the Forbidden City Spa.

457
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:40,152
You want to join us?

458
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:42,676
- You go and enjoy.
- Oh, come on!

459
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:46,036
No, you're better
at these franchise openings than I am.

460
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:49,112
You had a ball in Caracas.
I just had jet lag.

461
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:54,075
- Hey.
- Conor, come on, grab a seat.

462
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:56,594
Dad, there's something I want to ask you.

463
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:01,635
I spoke with Matt and both of us would
like it if you joined him in the surgery.

464
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:05,955
I'm fine with Mattie doing the surgery,
you know.

465
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:08,952
There's no ego here,
if that's what you're thinking.

466
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:11,879
What he's trying to say
is that he'd love to.

467
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:15,555
He just wants to make sure that
you're doing exactly what you wanna do.

468
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:17,949
Thank you, Christian,
for putting words in my mouth.

469
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:19,553
You're welcome.

470
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:22,914
What does your mother think about it?

471
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:26,754
She wants it as much as we all do.
It was her idea, in fact.

472
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:53,471
- You ready, little brother?
- I think so.

473
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:57,348
Yeah, well, don't worry,
I'll keep these two old men in line.

474
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:04,873
Count back from 10 for me, okay, kiddo?

475
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:08,916
Ten, nine, eight,

476
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:13,519
seven, six, five...

477
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:24,030
- Ten laser-blade.
- Ten laser-blade.

478
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:29,389
- Are you sure, Dad?
- Absolutely.

479
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:40,793
I'll never get used to the lack of blood.

480
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:04,516
Mattie, how much
do you want me to elongate?

481
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:06,113
Two sonimeters.

482
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:13,078
TGF Growth Factor.

483
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:24,238
I'm gonna close.

484
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:00,475
What?

485
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:04,314
You did an excellent job, Doctor.

486
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:20,191
Conor's doing great.

487
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:22,795
Oh, thank God.

488
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:24,757
He should have full usage of his new hand,

489
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:28,992
and it's gonna be far more articulate
than the one I operated on 20 years ago.

490
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:31,275
Very impressed with Matt's work.

491
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:34,636
He's a top-notch surgeon.
You should be very proud.

492
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:36,832
We both should be.

493
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:38,759
Excuse me.

494
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:43,435
- Are you the parents of Annie McNamara?
- Yes.

495
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:46,910
- Could you come with me, please?
- What's going on?

496
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:48,594
Your daughter has been arrested

497
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:51,797
for stealing painkillers
from the hospital pharmacy.

498
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:58,110
- Annie...
- Save it, okay?

499
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:00,919
I'll get my own lawyer,
he'll get me probation again,

500
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,991
and don't worry about the bail money.
I'll pay you back.

501
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:04,559
No, you won't.

502
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:09,073
I can't believe you would say that
to your own daughter.

503
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:10,354
- It's true.
- Sean.

504
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:12,237
She's 30 years old, Julia.

505
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:16,199
- We don't have to protect her anymore.
- Yeah, like you've ever done it in the past.

506
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:17,793
What are you talking about?

507
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:21,919
- You don't care about me. You never have.
- That's ridiculous.

508
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:26,835
You know, I barely have any memories
of us being together as a family.

509
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:29,388
And when we were,
you were always yelling.

510
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:32,392
Like that time I cut up my doll's hands
to look like Conor

511
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:35,438
because I was trying to process,
and you went all psycho?

512
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:38,512
I was 10. What kind of parenting was that?

513
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:41,034
I still feel awful about that.

514
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:43,680
Well, imagine that pain I feel, Julia.

515
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:48,276
That's why I had to steal the pills today,
because my pain never goes away.

516
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:53,673
Sorry you were awful parents,
so this is what you get.

517
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:54,829
Deal.

518
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:05,755
You're right.
We were pretty awful sometimes.

519
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:08,353
I did my best, sweetheart.

520
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:12,228
I mean, I may not have always been right,
but I did try.

521
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:16,711
And your father and I, we have a lot of
regrets about our parenting.

522
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,916
Absolutely,
but we've never stopped loving you.

523
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:22,675
And whatever pain that I caused,
and whatever hurt that I did,

524
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:25,797
I am really, truly sorry.

525
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:30,309
Me, too. I can't apologize enough.

526
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:33,557
Baby. Sweetie.

527
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:34,868
Okay.

528
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:38,199
- Why are you being so mean?
- Mean?

529
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:39,508
We're agreeing with you.

530
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:41,272
I know. I hate it.

531
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,194
It's pretty funny, actually.

532
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:51,475
Christian is still chasing the skirts
like he's 30.

533
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:55,394
Well, I guess it's good to see that his ego
hasn't been bruised by old age.

534
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:58,472
Yeah, he keeps saying 62 is the new 26.

535
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,389
What about you and your new hand?

536
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:07,280
I know, you always taught me
that being different has never stopped me

537
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:09,157
from doing everything I wanted in life,
Marlowe, but...

538
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:10,753
You don't have to explain, Conor.

539
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:12,956
This decision was yours and nobody else's.

540
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:16,953
It's a completely different thing
if the operation is done on an infant.

541
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:18,593
Uh-oh.

542
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:21,399
- Don't slug him, Dad.
- Annie.

543
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:26,551
- Hi, Marlowe.
- Sean, Julia. Good to see you both.

544
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:30,748
- How's the family?
- Good, good. Sally's good,

545
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:34,355
and Zack hit the game-winning shot
against Georgia last night.

546
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:36,396
Yeah, I read about it in the papers.
Congrats.

547
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:39,790
- How you feeling, tiger?
- I'm good. Thanks for being here.

548
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:41,950
Where else would I be? I love hospitals.

549
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:44,156
I practically grew up in them.

550
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:45,992
How's my patient doing?

551
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:49,117
I... Just a little weirded out by all this.

552
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:56,919
Janet, his vitals haven't been checked
since 10:00.

553
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,672
Oh, lay off her, Mattie.

554
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:01,320
She was just giving me a quick tour
of the new cancer wing.

555
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:02,719
I'm fine, okay?

556
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,995
Janet can redeem herself
by taking a photo of everyone for me.

557
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:07,799
- Yes. Let's! Come on!
- Photo.

558
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:09,599
You better mark the occasion.

559
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:11,910
This is probably the last time
this group will be together

560
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,672
until we're all at Christian's funeral.

561
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:16,194
My funeral? Why am I going first?

562
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:19,238
Just keep eating those ribs,
Uncle Butterball.

563
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:21,515
Mom and Dad. Come over here.

564
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:24,557
Look at you. All right.

565
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:27,200
- Cancer wing, huh?
- Yes, yes.

566
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:29,669
- Good man, I'm very impressed with you.
- I'm impressed with you.

567
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:30,909
Yeah.

568
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:47,269
Okay, say cheese.

569
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:48,793
Cheese!

570
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:19,155
It looks like a normal hand.

571
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:21,676
It's extraordinary, Conor.

572
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:25,397
Your brother's clearly a gifted surgeon.

573
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:28,552
My dad was there, too. And Christian.
It was...

574
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:30,952
God, it was amazing.

575
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:34,196
Just having them all there.

576
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:36,194
All for me.

577
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:39,997
And my mom was so supportive, too.
Even my dad.

578
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:51,152
You know, all my life
I felt like I was this curse on the family.

579
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:54,029
I'm the one who tore them apart.

580
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:58,190
Maybe that's why
I didn't do the surgery any sooner.

581
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:03,237
I needed to wait
until it could bring us all together.

582
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:08,277
I must've known it couldn't have happened
any sooner than it did.

583
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:11,112
It's a gift, Conor.

584
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:17,158
You chose the perfect moment
to erase this so-called curse.

585
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,151
And in return,
you get to move on with your life.

586
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:26,398
What's going on?

587
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:32,037
At dinner one night,

588
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:36,159
Christian said that once upon a time,
they loved each other.

589
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:37,798
My mom and dad.

590
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:45,750
I've never known anything between them
but bitterness and anger.

591
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:49,753
I always imagined the night
that I was conceived was some sort of

592
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:54,914
random, lonely hook-up
after they'd already given up completely.

593
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:06,713
I wish I felt like my parents
really loved each other. That's all.

594
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:20,199
Tampa's supposedly a disaster area.
Gainesville, too.

595
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:22,157
Are the buildings downtown still there?

596
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:24,879
Miami actually got the least of it.

597
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:26,598
The city's like our house.

598
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:28,875
A little beat up, but still standing.

599
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:31,997
How are people gonna
clean up all this mess?

600
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:36,198
People rebuild. That's what we do.

601
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:48,949
I wrote down all my mother's numbers.
It's on the fridge.

602
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:52,077
How long are we going to be in New York?

603
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:53,639
A while, honey.

604
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:59,799
- Are you coming in?
- No. I think it would kill me.

605
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:05,353
- Oh, baby.
- Bye, Daddy.

606
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:08,553
I love you, sweetie.

607
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:39,193
See you, Jules.

608
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:10,635
- I love you, you know.
- I love you, too.

609
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:57,829
English
