<i>Previously on Nip / Tuck:</i>

2
00:00:04,868 --> 00:00:07,359
-Are you a doctor?
-Plastic surgeon.

3
00:00:13,444 --> 00:00:16,242
Girls don't care
if you have a 2-inch pecker...

4
00:00:16,313 --> 00:00:18,679
a hairy ass, or balls like cranberries.

5
00:00:18,749 --> 00:00:21,741
What they care about
is that you know what you're doing.

6
00:00:21,819 --> 00:00:23,184
You ever done twins?

7
00:00:23,253 --> 00:00:25,687
Mother and daughter once,
but never twins.

8
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:28,254
-Hi.
-Hi.

9
00:00:28,559 --> 00:00:30,356
How do you seduce women?

10
00:00:34,331 --> 00:00:37,425
It's about charm, Sean, and confidence.

11
00:00:37,968 --> 00:00:40,095
You wine, you dine, you romance.

12
00:00:40,671 --> 00:00:43,367
Julia needs that.
She's clearly starved for it.

13
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,772
-How do you know that?
-Every woman is.

14
00:00:54,918 --> 00:00:56,442
God, it's good to be back.

15
00:00:59,289 --> 00:01:01,621
Tell me what you don't like about yourself.

16
00:01:01,692 --> 00:01:02,954
My eyes.

17
00:01:03,994 --> 00:01:07,361
Mr. Dempsey, what exactly do you think
is wrong with them?

18
00:01:07,831 --> 00:01:10,425
I'd like them to look more like hers.

19
00:01:12,236 --> 00:01:14,329
It's for my parents, actually.

20
00:01:15,305 --> 00:01:17,739
We're very close, and they are....

21
00:01:19,343 --> 00:01:21,311
-Traditional?
-Xenophobic.

22
00:01:21,378 --> 00:01:25,542
Her mother's Nisei. She was born
in a Japanese-American internment camp.

23
00:01:25,783 --> 00:01:29,378
Her family lost everything,
their home, their business, their dignity.

24
00:01:29,453 --> 00:01:33,947
She's always disapproved of any man
I went out with who wasn't Japanese.

25
00:01:35,459 --> 00:01:37,927
I just can't take the chance this time.

26
00:01:40,397 --> 00:01:41,864
Not with him.

27
00:01:42,666 --> 00:01:44,531
Not when you've found the one.

28
00:01:45,969 --> 00:01:47,527
Miss Moriata, if he's the one...

29
00:01:47,604 --> 00:01:50,038
why not elope
and then introduce him to your mother?

30
00:01:50,107 --> 00:01:53,838
It's a lot more reasonable than asking
your fiancé to rearrange his face.

31
00:01:53,911 --> 00:01:57,005
The last man I was serious about
was also white.

32
00:01:57,514 --> 00:02:00,779
She said if I married him,
I will never see her again.

33
00:02:01,952 --> 00:02:04,512
Our children will never know their family.

34
00:02:04,588 --> 00:02:06,886
I can't let Leigh
make that kind of sacrifice...

35
00:02:06,957 --> 00:02:09,255
when I can prevent it
by having this operation.

36
00:02:09,326 --> 00:02:11,453
lt isn't quite so simple, Mr. Dempsey.

37
00:02:11,528 --> 00:02:15,020
There's no guarantee that the surgery,
no matter how good a job we do...

38
00:02:15,099 --> 00:02:18,660
is going to adequately convince
Leigh's mother that you're Japanese.

39
00:02:18,735 --> 00:02:21,829
I'd hate to put you through the pain
and trauma of an operation...

40
00:02:21,905 --> 00:02:24,203
and not have it come out
the way you'd like it to.

41
00:02:24,274 --> 00:02:26,401
And the procedure
is somewhat uncommon...

42
00:02:26,477 --> 00:02:28,570
so there would be some extra expense.

43
00:02:28,645 --> 00:02:30,306
Whatever the cost.

44
00:02:30,981 --> 00:02:34,041
-Maybe you should think about it.
-My mind's made up.

45
00:02:35,352 --> 00:02:39,652
Haven't you ever loved someone so much
that you're willing to do anything...

46
00:02:40,424 --> 00:02:42,255
to keep from losing them?

47
00:02:55,839 --> 00:02:59,570
Mom, I can't find my pyramid.
I don't know what you did with it.

48
00:02:59,643 --> 00:03:03,636
I'll be right there, Annie.
I'm just a little busy at the moment.

49
00:03:22,533 --> 00:03:23,625
Shit.

50
00:04:28,899 --> 00:04:30,230
It's real.

51
00:04:30,534 --> 00:04:33,094
-Yes.
-You weren't even looking, were you?

52
00:04:33,170 --> 00:04:34,967
I have firsthand knowledge.

53
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:39,304
You know, women in this country,
they've got no modesty.

54
00:04:39,876 --> 00:04:42,344
-God bless America.
-You interested?

55
00:04:42,412 --> 00:04:45,006
I'm looking for something higher
on the food chain.

56
00:04:45,082 --> 00:04:47,141
-What about you, Victor?
-I'm through looking.

57
00:04:47,217 --> 00:04:48,241
You're only engaged.

58
00:04:48,318 --> 00:04:50,878
Monogamy doesn't go into effect
until after the wedding.

59
00:04:50,954 --> 00:04:53,422
-Susannah doesn't see it that way.
-She'll never know.

60
00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:54,582
Yeah, she bloody will.

61
00:04:54,658 --> 00:04:57,092
After you commit,
it don't matter what you wash with...

62
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:59,151
they smell infidelity on you like cat piss.

63
00:04:59,229 --> 00:05:01,424
I get it. Two of you are just jealous...

64
00:05:01,498 --> 00:05:03,762
because I get all I want
whenever I want it.

65
00:05:03,834 --> 00:05:06,632
Ever notice
how monogamy rhymes with monotony?

66
00:05:06,703 --> 00:05:08,193
I feel sorry for you, man.

67
00:05:08,272 --> 00:05:10,900
-Obviously, you've never been in love.
-Of course I have.

68
00:05:10,974 --> 00:05:14,410
It's that beautiful moment between
meeting the woman of your dreams...

69
00:05:14,478 --> 00:05:16,378
and seeing her stretch marks.

70
00:05:17,948 --> 00:05:21,179
-Does Susannah give you head?
-All the time.

71
00:05:21,551 --> 00:05:23,712
Well, don't get too used to it.

72
00:05:23,787 --> 00:05:26,449
Once you say "I do," they say "I don't."

73
00:05:26,523 --> 00:05:29,720
Untrue. Some of the best blowjobs
I've had were from married women.

74
00:05:29,793 --> 00:05:31,727
Americans don't know
the meaning of oral sex.

75
00:05:31,795 --> 00:05:32,853
Okay, here we go.

76
00:05:32,929 --> 00:05:36,524
So everything European is better,
right, Serge? Cigarettes? Wine?

77
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,261
German women, they're the best.

78
00:05:38,335 --> 00:05:41,532
Speaking, of course,
as the expert on international head.

79
00:05:41,738 --> 00:05:44,366
Has to do with their ability
to follow orders.

80
00:05:48,278 --> 00:05:51,805
Excuse me, gentlemen,
but that poor girl looks parched.

81
00:05:52,115 --> 00:05:53,912
I'd better buy her a drink.

82
00:05:54,184 --> 00:05:56,209
Don't you ever get tired of it, man?

83
00:05:56,286 --> 00:05:58,550
The whole
who-am-l-gonna-lay-tonight scene?

84
00:05:58,622 --> 00:06:01,523
Yes, Victor, I do.
I get absolutely exhausted.

85
00:06:04,561 --> 00:06:06,995
It's not just peas and corn, people.

86
00:06:07,297 --> 00:06:10,733
Mendel and McClintock have provided us
with the key to understanding...

87
00:06:10,801 --> 00:06:14,362
how physical appearance,
metabolic capacity, and intelligence...

88
00:06:14,438 --> 00:06:17,066
are passed on from parents to offspring.

89
00:06:17,441 --> 00:06:20,069
Of course, we're talking about
inherent potential...

90
00:06:20,143 --> 00:06:23,806
which some organisms may reach,
while others will not.

91
00:06:26,583 --> 00:06:28,574
Someone's been studying, I see.

92
00:06:40,497 --> 00:06:44,194
Well, I guess I know who I'll be
sitting next to during the MCATs.

93
00:06:44,768 --> 00:06:46,201
Better pick someone else.

94
00:06:46,269 --> 00:06:50,035
No, listen, I promise I'll only copy
questions on Mendel and McClintock.

95
00:06:50,807 --> 00:06:52,331
Why don't we discuss it over lunch?

96
00:06:52,409 --> 00:06:54,468
-Have you ever been to Tantra?
-Oh, Jude, I'm--

97
00:06:54,544 --> 00:06:58,913
<i>No, it's great. They got this movie of the
Kamasutra playing in the dining room.</i>

98
00:06:59,116 --> 00:07:01,516
Perfect place to discuss reproduction.

99
00:07:02,219 --> 00:07:06,383
Look, Jude, I'm flattered in every way.

100
00:07:06,456 --> 00:07:08,822
But you'd just be wasting your time.

101
00:07:09,126 --> 00:07:11,924
I'm probably
not even going to med school.

102
00:07:12,396 --> 00:07:15,331
So what are you gonna do
with all that beauty and brains?

103
00:07:15,399 --> 00:07:18,232
I don't know.
Pass them on to my offspring?

104
00:07:20,504 --> 00:07:22,563
Apparently, she left him for someone else.

105
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:25,938
If she looked like this,
he probably paid the guy to abduct her.

106
00:07:26,009 --> 00:07:28,409
-What would make someone do this?
-Love.

107
00:07:29,413 --> 00:07:32,314
He was obviously
deeply in love with Toyota.

108
00:07:35,485 --> 00:07:37,282
The butt crack's tough to read.

109
00:07:37,354 --> 00:07:39,083
It's a sign of commitment.

110
00:07:39,723 --> 00:07:42,886
Maybe it was his way of telling the world
he'd met his soul mate.

111
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:44,893
Whom we'll now scrape off his back...

112
00:07:44,961 --> 00:07:47,452
along with two layers of skin
down to the dermis.

113
00:07:47,531 --> 00:07:49,226
You and Julia love each other.

114
00:07:49,299 --> 00:07:52,564
I don't see you branding
each other's names all over your butts.

115
00:07:52,636 --> 00:07:55,628
Then again, I haven't showered
with either of you since college.

116
00:07:55,705 --> 00:07:57,969
We discussed it before we got married.

117
00:07:58,975 --> 00:08:00,943
She thought I was crazy.

118
00:08:01,645 --> 00:08:03,169
I would've done it.

119
00:08:03,246 --> 00:08:05,373
I have a tattoo on my right breast.

120
00:08:05,916 --> 00:08:09,079
-Two female symbols intertwined.
-Double dykes.

121
00:08:09,719 --> 00:08:12,779
I'm expressing my lesbian identity.

122
00:08:14,524 --> 00:08:17,425
Excuse me. I have a couple
who have been waiting an hour.

123
00:08:17,494 --> 00:08:19,189
They want to talk to one of you.

124
00:08:19,262 --> 00:08:20,820
You go. I can do this.

125
00:08:21,832 --> 00:08:23,766
So can l. You go.

126
00:08:25,836 --> 00:08:27,269
Well, I need one of you.

127
00:08:27,337 --> 00:08:30,795
They've read the brochure so many times,
they've memorized it.

128
00:08:31,908 --> 00:08:35,207
Things won't improve unless
you work on them. You're not even trying.

129
00:08:35,278 --> 00:08:38,736
Believe me, if I wasn't trying,
she'd be dead by now.

130
00:08:54,197 --> 00:08:55,892
The car was totaled.

131
00:08:56,266 --> 00:08:59,861
People who saw what happened
couldn't believe I just walked away.

132
00:08:59,936 --> 00:09:03,770
I just thank God she's alive.
I don't know how I'd make it without her.

133
00:09:04,174 --> 00:09:05,937
Nothing else broken?

134
00:09:06,443 --> 00:09:09,344
-No, just my nose.
-I see.

135
00:09:10,213 --> 00:09:14,343
Since it has to be reset anyway,
if that is the right expression...

136
00:09:14,417 --> 00:09:17,682
I was hoping you could do something
to make it a little cuter.

137
00:09:17,754 --> 00:09:20,552
-Your nose couldn't be any cuter.
-Never mind him.

138
00:09:20,624 --> 00:09:24,720
I had a zit the size of Mt. Saint Helens
that he thought was adorable.

139
00:09:25,595 --> 00:09:26,926
Excuse me.

140
00:09:28,999 --> 00:09:30,330
Okay.

141
00:09:39,276 --> 00:09:40,607
Let's see.

142
00:09:41,411 --> 00:09:44,642
Maybe we could take off a little here.

143
00:09:46,283 --> 00:09:49,343
-And then--
-Any other side effects from the accident?

144
00:09:49,619 --> 00:09:53,180
Dreams? lnability to focus?
Undue fear? Sleeplessness?

145
00:09:53,957 --> 00:09:54,981
No.

146
00:09:55,058 --> 00:09:58,550
Excuse me, Dr. Santiago,
I'd assumed you'd asked these questions...

147
00:09:58,628 --> 00:10:01,597
while they were waiting for me
to get out of surgery.

148
00:10:04,034 --> 00:10:08,494
I tell you what. I'll talk it over
with my partner, Dr. McNamara...

149
00:10:08,939 --> 00:10:11,635
and we'll schedule you for surgery.

150
00:10:11,908 --> 00:10:13,705
-Okay?
-Okay.

151
00:10:14,544 --> 00:10:17,035
Anything you'd like to add, Dr. Santiago?

152
00:10:17,347 --> 00:10:19,315
-Not a thing.
-Excellent.

153
00:10:22,752 --> 00:10:24,276
Thank you, Dr. Troy.

154
00:10:24,354 --> 00:10:26,822
Make sure Nurse Linda
gets all your information.

155
00:10:26,890 --> 00:10:28,687
-This way.
-Thank you.

156
00:10:30,293 --> 00:10:32,727
I see no problem
after a life-threatening accident.

157
00:10:32,796 --> 00:10:34,593
A little change can be therapeutic.

158
00:10:34,664 --> 00:10:37,792
Dr. Santiago, do me a favor.
When a patient is waiting for me...

159
00:10:37,867 --> 00:10:41,997
for whatever reason, please begin
your consultation in your office.

160
00:10:42,238 --> 00:10:44,672
-And when I'm through?
-Stay there.

161
00:10:56,386 --> 00:10:57,910
-What?
-Nothing.

162
00:10:58,021 --> 00:11:02,287
I was just thinking, it's a shame
turtlenecks aren't in style anymore.

163
00:11:31,021 --> 00:11:33,046
Hi, honey. These are for you.

164
00:11:36,026 --> 00:11:37,459
That was a joke.

165
00:11:38,161 --> 00:11:41,858
Thank you. They're lovely.
You shouldn't have gone to the trouble.

166
00:11:44,501 --> 00:11:47,299
-What the hell is that stink?
-Decay.

167
00:11:48,038 --> 00:11:50,734
I kept meaning to throw them out, but....

168
00:11:52,242 --> 00:11:53,732
You need some help?

169
00:11:55,412 --> 00:11:57,209
Why don't I set the table.

170
00:12:07,691 --> 00:12:09,454
Hey, you got an A.

171
00:12:11,327 --> 00:12:12,487
Minus.

172
00:12:13,596 --> 00:12:15,291
Still, I'm impressed.

173
00:12:17,233 --> 00:12:20,566
-It's just one test.
-Is this the teacher you knew in college?

174
00:12:20,904 --> 00:12:24,362
lt was multiple-choice,
in case you think she showed favoritism.

175
00:12:24,474 --> 00:12:27,602
I meant you've always been
a great student. Better than me.

176
00:12:27,677 --> 00:12:31,579
-That was a long time ago.
-You've obviously still got potential.

177
00:12:33,650 --> 00:12:36,050
You know what potential is, Sean?

178
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:38,248
Nothing.

179
00:12:39,289 --> 00:12:40,881
Just wishful thinking.

180
00:12:40,957 --> 00:12:44,415
A possibility that doesn't exist
unless it's fulfilled.

181
00:12:45,428 --> 00:12:48,056
The truth about the acorn is the tree.

182
00:12:48,598 --> 00:12:51,999
-Remember? Junior year Philosophy?
-Nietzsche?

183
00:12:52,502 --> 00:12:54,936
-Hegel.
-I rest my case.

184
00:12:55,004 --> 00:12:56,869
But just look at us, Sean.

185
00:12:57,807 --> 00:13:02,005
I'm still the acorn
and you became the tree.

186
00:13:13,656 --> 00:13:16,921
You want to go to med school?
We'll make it happen.

187
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:20,887
You've got my support financially,
emotionally, whatever it takes.

188
00:13:20,964 --> 00:13:22,431
I'm pregnant.

189
00:13:23,299 --> 00:13:25,096
Hey, what's for supper?

190
00:13:27,170 --> 00:13:30,367
What's that smell?
Did something die in here or what?

191
00:13:38,481 --> 00:13:41,041
So you guys ready
to turn Charlie Brown into Pokémon?

192
00:13:41,117 --> 00:13:44,416
Does anyone here besides me
think it's morally reprehensible...

193
00:13:44,487 --> 00:13:47,479
for a white man
to pass himself off as a victim...

194
00:13:47,557 --> 00:13:49,320
of the American racial hierarchy?

195
00:13:49,392 --> 00:13:51,656
Tell her to quit using
those big words around me.

196
00:13:51,728 --> 00:13:54,458
-It's our job to alleviate pain.
-That's your answer?

197
00:13:54,531 --> 00:13:56,829
Why don't we just turn everyone
white and hetero?

198
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:59,368
We can change
the obstacle that separates this guy...

199
00:13:59,435 --> 00:14:02,427
from the one thing he wants.
I see nothing wrong in doing that.

200
00:14:02,505 --> 00:14:05,770
-Liz, you shave under your arms?
-Of course.

201
00:14:06,176 --> 00:14:08,576
Why, trying to pass yourself off
as being straight?

202
00:14:08,645 --> 00:14:12,240
Keep talking.
You are so close to a harassment suit.

203
00:14:15,185 --> 00:14:17,517
Could you act professional
around her for a change?

204
00:14:17,587 --> 00:14:18,849
Is that too much to ask?

205
00:14:18,922 --> 00:14:21,618
Who pissed in your CREAM OF WHEAT
this morning?

206
00:14:25,361 --> 00:14:26,988
Julia's pregnant.

207
00:14:30,433 --> 00:14:32,025
Congratulations.

208
00:14:34,137 --> 00:14:36,503
Or should I not say congratulations?

209
00:14:36,573 --> 00:14:38,165
I don't know, actually.

210
00:14:41,311 --> 00:14:42,903
Is Julia excited?

211
00:14:42,979 --> 00:14:46,346
It's complicated. I mean,
she started taking these premed courses.

212
00:14:46,416 --> 00:14:49,476
This was supposed to be her time to,
you know, do her thing.

213
00:14:49,552 --> 00:14:51,281
That was sort of the plan.

214
00:14:51,487 --> 00:14:53,148
So she's ambivalent.

215
00:14:53,223 --> 00:14:57,125
Timing has never been my strong suit
as far as Julia getting pregnant.

216
00:14:57,327 --> 00:15:00,922
Like with Matt, remember?
What you said back then really helped.

217
00:15:01,264 --> 00:15:03,255
I can't imagine my life now without him.

218
00:15:03,333 --> 00:15:06,268
I just told you
what you wanted to hear, that's all.

219
00:15:06,636 --> 00:15:08,831
Well, do it again.

220
00:15:09,606 --> 00:15:13,133
You mean talk you out of
pushing Julia into having an abortion?

221
00:15:13,676 --> 00:15:14,768
Yeah.

222
00:15:15,645 --> 00:15:17,169
I don't think I can.

223
00:15:17,547 --> 00:15:19,515
You were in a different place back then.

224
00:15:19,582 --> 00:15:23,018
-You guys were young. You were in love.
-We're still in love.

225
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:37,225
Listen, if your gut is telling you
something is not right, maybe it isn't.

226
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:40,827
Or maybe it is. Maybe it'll give us
something good to focus on.

227
00:15:41,237 --> 00:15:44,968
Don't take this the wrong way,
but you haven't exactly been Superdad.

228
00:15:45,642 --> 00:15:48,042
So I'll do better this time. People change.

229
00:15:48,111 --> 00:15:51,342
Faces change, and asses and thighs,
but people? Come on, Sean.

230
00:15:51,414 --> 00:15:54,247
You think he'll be Japanese
'cause we make him look Asian?

231
00:15:54,317 --> 00:15:56,444
No one changes. We are who we are.

232
00:16:36,259 --> 00:16:37,692
Oh, my God!

233
00:16:51,774 --> 00:16:56,006
It's considered a courtesy for the person
who finishes the pot to make more.

234
00:16:56,479 --> 00:17:00,575
Is it? I just assumed you had a coffee girl
who provided you with that service.

235
00:17:00,650 --> 00:17:02,117
No, we don't.

236
00:17:02,385 --> 00:17:04,751
Odd. I'd have thought
making coffee would be...

237
00:17:04,821 --> 00:17:07,289
a lot more difficult than watering plants.

238
00:17:07,957 --> 00:17:11,518
Jasmine's special.
She has a gift for making things grow.

239
00:17:12,295 --> 00:17:15,025
Are you repeatedly flaunting
this adolescent behavior...

240
00:17:15,098 --> 00:17:18,067
in front of me because a woman
has invaded your boys' club?

241
00:17:18,134 --> 00:17:21,934
If it makes you feel too uncomfortable,
feel free to leave.

242
00:17:22,005 --> 00:17:25,099
I'm sure that Sean will give you
a glowing recommendation.

243
00:17:25,174 --> 00:17:28,268
I hope you'll take this
in the spirit in which it is intended.

244
00:17:28,344 --> 00:17:31,438
I can tell you going any further
with that sentence is a mistake.

245
00:17:31,514 --> 00:17:34,608
The Presbyterian Church
on 64th and Collins has S.A. meetings...

246
00:17:34,684 --> 00:17:36,618
every night from 8:00 to 9:00.

247
00:17:38,121 --> 00:17:39,713
Sexaholics Anonymous.

248
00:17:39,789 --> 00:17:43,782
I'm speaking to you as a professional,
Christian. I think you've got a problem.

249
00:17:44,761 --> 00:17:48,390
Do you know how many men
would give their right nut for my problem?

250
00:17:48,464 --> 00:17:52,730
Too much sex is as strong an indication
of intimacy problems as too little.

251
00:17:53,036 --> 00:17:56,028
I've given you the information.
What you do with it is up to you.

252
00:17:56,105 --> 00:17:59,404
Dr. Santiago, perhaps you should consider
having your own orgasm...

253
00:17:59,475 --> 00:18:03,002
every now and then so that you don't
have to live through mine.

254
00:18:12,655 --> 00:18:14,555
-Hey.
-Hey.

255
00:18:25,034 --> 00:18:28,936
Listen, I've been giving it
a lot of thought...

256
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:33,606
and I think we should have the baby.

257
00:18:36,546 --> 00:18:39,811
I have, too, Sean,
been giving it a lot of thought.

258
00:18:41,117 --> 00:18:44,177
Come on, Jules. I think it'll be good for us.

259
00:18:45,288 --> 00:18:48,155
-Us?
-Yeah. Just what we need.

260
00:18:50,793 --> 00:18:53,227
I'm not sure you know what I need, Sean.

261
00:18:55,164 --> 00:18:57,428
I like being back at school.

262
00:18:58,835 --> 00:19:01,565
When am I gonna take the MCATs,
when I'm 50?

263
00:19:01,771 --> 00:19:03,500
Who's stopping you?

264
00:19:04,207 --> 00:19:06,266
You're always working.

265
00:19:06,709 --> 00:19:10,201
You have no idea
what it takes to raise a child.

266
00:19:11,247 --> 00:19:13,511
The energy, the patience.

267
00:19:14,083 --> 00:19:16,711
How much of yourself you have to give up.

268
00:19:19,155 --> 00:19:21,487
I don't think I can do it again.

269
00:19:23,192 --> 00:19:24,716
I'll stay home.

270
00:19:26,095 --> 00:19:28,427
I'll take off as much time as we need.

271
00:19:29,031 --> 00:19:33,127
There's no reason for you to give up
being a doctor if that's what you want.

272
00:19:38,808 --> 00:19:40,435
You'll stay home?

273
00:19:42,879 --> 00:19:45,746
Don't say it if you don't mean it.

274
00:19:45,815 --> 00:19:49,114
I have no intention of missing out
this time around.

275
00:19:59,662 --> 00:20:01,129
Macallan 18?

276
00:20:02,832 --> 00:20:06,029
-You know your scotch.
-I know my scotch drinkers.

277
00:20:17,046 --> 00:20:19,105
You don't remember me, do you?

278
00:20:20,917 --> 00:20:22,441
Shelly Edwards.

279
00:20:23,819 --> 00:20:27,152
I came to your office a couple of years ago
to have something done...

280
00:20:27,223 --> 00:20:30,124
in exchange
for you having a little something done.

281
00:20:32,261 --> 00:20:34,058
An awfully good time.

282
00:20:35,398 --> 00:20:39,357
Till I made the fatal mistake
of asking if you had any feelings for me.

283
00:20:41,737 --> 00:20:43,227
Eyes, chin.

284
00:20:43,839 --> 00:20:46,364
Especially nice job on the jaw line.

285
00:20:46,676 --> 00:20:50,168
Shelly Edwards, of course.
I'm sorry I didn't recognize you.

286
00:20:50,246 --> 00:20:52,043
Underneath the ruins?

287
00:21:01,691 --> 00:21:03,955
So, think you could freshen me up?

288
00:21:04,427 --> 00:21:06,054
Same arrangement?

289
00:21:08,431 --> 00:21:10,058
I don't think so.

290
00:21:13,336 --> 00:21:15,304
-Raised your prices?
-No.

291
00:21:15,972 --> 00:21:17,735
Prices are the same.

292
00:21:17,907 --> 00:21:19,932
-The currency's--
-Changed.

293
00:21:27,183 --> 00:21:29,879
It's late.
I've got surgery tomorrow morning.

294
00:21:31,187 --> 00:21:32,984
Remember my daughter?

295
00:21:34,490 --> 00:21:35,821
Seventeen now.

296
00:21:37,526 --> 00:21:39,551
Looks just like I used to.

297
00:21:40,896 --> 00:21:43,558
Not a mark on her, tight as a drum.

298
00:21:46,335 --> 00:21:48,860
You ever have
a mother-daughter, Christian?

299
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:52,831
You can have both of us, baby.

300
00:21:53,743 --> 00:21:55,142
Two for one.

301
00:21:59,348 --> 00:22:01,475
I know just how you like it.

302
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:05,619
I'll show her.

303
00:22:18,734 --> 00:22:22,226
...serenity to accept the things
I cannot change...

304
00:22:22,872 --> 00:22:25,636
courage to change the things I can...

305
00:22:25,708 --> 00:22:28,336
and the wisdom to know the difference.

306
00:22:36,719 --> 00:22:39,517
-Hi, I'm Gina.
-Hi, Gina.

307
00:22:40,222 --> 00:22:43,521
Before we begin, I'd like to ask
if there are any new people here...

308
00:22:43,592 --> 00:22:45,457
could you please raise your hands?

309
00:23:03,112 --> 00:23:05,808
I left halfway through
my first time here, too.

310
00:23:06,882 --> 00:23:08,747
Then I went out and got laid.

311
00:23:08,818 --> 00:23:11,719
I was considering that,
but I have surgery in the morning.

312
00:23:11,787 --> 00:23:13,015
Oh, boy.

313
00:23:13,322 --> 00:23:15,813
They must cream their panties
when they hear that.

314
00:23:15,891 --> 00:23:18,758
They do.
However, it's frequently the truth.

315
00:23:18,828 --> 00:23:20,796
So, how's it usually go?

316
00:23:20,963 --> 00:23:23,158
Girl meets surgeon, surgeon bangs girl...

317
00:23:23,232 --> 00:23:25,860
surgeon has great excuse
to leave before dawn?

318
00:23:26,268 --> 00:23:27,462
Am I close?

319
00:23:27,536 --> 00:23:30,130
We go to my place, and I give her cab fare.

320
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:33,265
A gentleman. Nice.

321
00:23:34,243 --> 00:23:37,679
So, how many women
have you slept with in the last year?

322
00:23:37,747 --> 00:23:40,045
Like you said, I'm a gentleman.

323
00:23:40,116 --> 00:23:42,050
How about in the last month?

324
00:23:42,118 --> 00:23:44,586
I'll go home
and count the notches on my bedpost.

325
00:23:44,653 --> 00:23:45,984
Last week?

326
00:23:46,088 --> 00:23:48,488
I bet you're searching
for that special someone.

327
00:23:48,557 --> 00:23:51,924
The one who's hotter and smarter
and better than the one you're with.

328
00:23:51,994 --> 00:23:53,018
You're good.

329
00:23:53,095 --> 00:23:55,359
Since I started the program,
things have changed.

330
00:23:55,431 --> 00:23:58,332
I don't go home with anyone
who reinforces my low self-image.

331
00:23:58,401 --> 00:24:02,132
I don't blow anyone off because he has
the bad taste to actually like me.

332
00:24:02,204 --> 00:24:04,968
I've gone eight months
without a one-nighter.

333
00:24:09,211 --> 00:24:10,838
Here's my number.

334
00:24:12,047 --> 00:24:14,379
You want a sponsor, give me a call.

335
00:24:23,192 --> 00:24:25,387
<i>-Hello?
-Want to go for a drink...</i>

336
00:24:26,195 --> 00:24:27,423
Sponsor?

337
00:24:36,806 --> 00:24:39,639
A plastic surgeon. Perfect.

338
00:24:40,342 --> 00:24:44,438
God, I must have wanted you to see
my flaws and find me repulsive. Shit!

339
00:24:44,513 --> 00:24:48,108
You're not repulsive. I said we could
do something about your stretch marks.

340
00:24:48,184 --> 00:24:51,551
Eight months of meetings,
my life was finally under control.

341
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:53,349
Under who's control?

342
00:24:53,422 --> 00:24:56,152
The anonymous sex-crazed sycophants
who meet once a week...

343
00:24:56,225 --> 00:24:58,250
to group-think
their way out of desperation?

344
00:24:58,327 --> 00:25:01,057
Well, I would not expect you
to believe in a higher power.

345
00:25:01,130 --> 00:25:03,030
You already think you're God.

346
00:25:03,666 --> 00:25:04,758
Here.

347
00:25:05,501 --> 00:25:07,366
What the hell is that?

348
00:25:07,536 --> 00:25:08,798
Cab fare.

349
00:25:09,371 --> 00:25:11,066
You're throwing me out?

350
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:14,598
I really do have surgery in four hours.
If I don't get some sleep...

351
00:25:14,677 --> 00:25:16,804
I could wind up scarring someone for life.

352
00:25:16,879 --> 00:25:18,676
And you're not scarring me for life?

353
00:25:18,747 --> 00:25:20,681
No, forget it. I am not leaving.

354
00:25:20,749 --> 00:25:23,149
I have too much self-respect for that.

355
00:25:25,221 --> 00:25:27,712
That's it. Come on!

356
00:25:27,790 --> 00:25:30,224
Time to 12-step your way out of here.

357
00:25:30,292 --> 00:25:33,284
You are a narcissistic bastard,
you know that?

358
00:25:34,196 --> 00:25:36,630
You want the wisdom
to know the difference between...

359
00:25:36,699 --> 00:25:38,633
what you can and can't change?

360
00:25:40,269 --> 00:25:43,261
Here's Step 13: Everything disappears.

361
00:25:43,339 --> 00:25:46,866
Love, trees, rocks, steel, plastic...

362
00:25:47,543 --> 00:25:50,774
human beings. None of us get out alive.

363
00:25:51,247 --> 00:25:54,307
You can huddle in a group
and face it one day at a time...

364
00:25:54,383 --> 00:25:58,683
or you can be grateful that when
your body rubs against somebody else's...

365
00:25:58,754 --> 00:26:02,781
it explodes with enough pleasure
to make you forget even for a minute...

366
00:26:02,858 --> 00:26:05,656
that you're only a walking pile of ashes.

367
00:26:06,028 --> 00:26:08,462
Now, that is the truth.

368
00:26:11,734 --> 00:26:13,827
If you're strong, it'll make you free.

369
00:26:13,903 --> 00:26:15,996
If you're weak, it'll make you...

370
00:26:17,806 --> 00:26:18,864
you.

371
00:26:29,351 --> 00:26:31,478
You still got my number, right?

372
00:26:49,138 --> 00:26:52,699
Just wanted to tell you the work
you did yesterday on that cleft palate...

373
00:26:52,775 --> 00:26:54,743
-didn't suck.
-Flatterer.

374
00:26:56,378 --> 00:26:59,370
And Julia and l
have decided to have the baby.

375
00:27:02,851 --> 00:27:05,081
If that's what you guys want, then...

376
00:27:05,387 --> 00:27:06,820
congratulations.

377
00:27:06,889 --> 00:27:10,154
And I want to take some time off
for paternity leave.

378
00:27:10,225 --> 00:27:11,920
At least three months.

379
00:27:12,027 --> 00:27:13,790
We'll hire somebody.

380
00:27:16,732 --> 00:27:19,132
Plastic surgeons
aren't your standard office temps.

381
00:27:19,201 --> 00:27:21,294
You can't put an ad in the paper saying:

382
00:27:21,370 --> 00:27:24,339
"Must type 70 words a minute
and do mammoplasty."

383
00:27:24,406 --> 00:27:26,306
I'm gonna make this work, Christian.

384
00:27:26,375 --> 00:27:29,902
I'm sorry for the inconvenience.
I'll do everything I can to minimize it.

385
00:27:29,979 --> 00:27:33,278
I'd love to feel you're behind my doing it,
but even if you're not...

386
00:27:33,349 --> 00:27:35,112
I'm doing it anyway.

387
00:27:40,990 --> 00:27:42,082
Shit!

388
00:27:57,506 --> 00:27:58,598
Shit!

389
00:27:59,008 --> 00:28:02,205
-What's the problem?
-Her jaw won't open far enough.

390
00:28:02,277 --> 00:28:05,178
-I can't see her cords.
-Maybe she broke it.

391
00:28:05,314 --> 00:28:07,942
I have to intubate her fiberoptically.

392
00:28:24,133 --> 00:28:25,395
I got it.

393
00:28:29,938 --> 00:28:31,963
Nose, nose, anything goes.

394
00:28:35,544 --> 00:28:36,943
Thank you, Nurse.

395
00:28:53,262 --> 00:28:54,490
Very gritty.

396
00:28:55,764 --> 00:28:57,493
Scar tissue, lots of it.

397
00:28:59,301 --> 00:29:00,666
She's a gusher.

398
00:29:03,105 --> 00:29:05,096
There shouldn't be that much blood.

399
00:29:12,848 --> 00:29:15,681
Dr. Santiago,
have you ever been sued for malpractice?

400
00:29:15,751 --> 00:29:17,343
As a matter of fact, I haven't.

401
00:29:17,419 --> 00:29:21,014
'Course not. lt'd be like suing
a witch doctor for a spell that didn't work.

402
00:29:21,090 --> 00:29:23,422
-Good night.
-We hired you to weed out the sickos...

403
00:29:23,492 --> 00:29:25,221
because you had professional insight...

404
00:29:25,294 --> 00:29:28,923
but when the big one came along,
it slipped by you just like everybody else.

405
00:29:28,997 --> 00:29:31,329
-What are you talking about?
-Ellie Collins.

406
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:33,595
She was never in an accident.

407
00:29:36,705 --> 00:29:39,799
There, that's where the trouble is,
right there.

408
00:29:40,042 --> 00:29:42,567
-I can't see anything.
-I don't understand.

409
00:29:42,644 --> 00:29:45,636
I didn't have this problem
with Matt or Annie.

410
00:29:45,714 --> 00:29:47,944
We don't know why it happens, Julia.

411
00:29:48,217 --> 00:29:51,050
Your age may be a factor.
You've had two kids.

412
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:54,556
I don't even know where to look,
and I'm a doctor, for God's sake.

413
00:29:54,623 --> 00:29:57,990
Here. You can't see the embryo.
It's still too early.

414
00:29:58,527 --> 00:30:01,052
lncompetent cervix. That fits.

415
00:30:01,130 --> 00:30:03,325
It's nothing to be too alarmed about.

416
00:30:03,398 --> 00:30:06,925
What's usually done in this situation
is something called a cerclage.

417
00:30:07,002 --> 00:30:09,698
I place a stitch around the cervix
to reinforce it...

418
00:30:09,772 --> 00:30:13,299
so it won't weaken and dilate
under the weight of your growing baby.

419
00:30:13,375 --> 00:30:15,036
Because we could miscarry.

420
00:30:15,110 --> 00:30:18,568
That, or have a premature rupture
of the fetal membranes...

421
00:30:18,781 --> 00:30:20,874
possibly preterm delivery.

422
00:30:22,317 --> 00:30:24,945
Okay. Good. That's what we'll do then.

423
00:30:25,554 --> 00:30:26,816
A cerclage.

424
00:30:26,889 --> 00:30:29,983
I would, however,
strongly recommend bed rest...

425
00:30:30,325 --> 00:30:33,761
both before the procedure and after,
until you are full-term.

426
00:30:33,829 --> 00:30:35,353
How much bed rest?

427
00:30:35,430 --> 00:30:37,591
Modified. I like to play it safe.

428
00:30:37,666 --> 00:30:40,533
You can sit up for meals,
shower every few days...

429
00:30:40,602 --> 00:30:43,230
bathroom privileges, but try to avoid...

430
00:30:43,305 --> 00:30:46,365
too much walking or lifting
or sexual intercourse.

431
00:30:50,078 --> 00:30:53,241
I don't think I can stay in bed
for seven months.

432
00:30:53,916 --> 00:30:57,682
You'd be amazed what you can do
if you want something badly enough.

433
00:31:14,536 --> 00:31:17,505
<i>I've known my ex-friend here for 10 years.</i>

434
00:31:17,573 --> 00:31:19,507
<i>I've known him from school and sports.</i>

435
00:31:19,575 --> 00:31:22,567
Okay, take-out menus
for when you're hungry...

436
00:31:22,945 --> 00:31:26,346
and more catalogues
for when you're bored and want to shop.

437
00:31:27,482 --> 00:31:30,417
I believe you're encouraging me
to spend money?

438
00:31:30,485 --> 00:31:31,816
I'm not an idiot.

439
00:31:31,887 --> 00:31:34,515
You never buy clothes
when you put on weight.

440
00:31:35,791 --> 00:31:37,486
I almost forgot. Here.

441
00:31:37,726 --> 00:31:41,162
The bed rest chat room says
it's the best thing for boredom.

442
00:31:42,564 --> 00:31:44,191
A Game Boy.

443
00:31:45,434 --> 00:31:47,459
Honey, you shouldn't have.

444
00:31:48,837 --> 00:31:50,395
Batteries included.

445
00:31:52,474 --> 00:31:54,374
Call me if you need anything.

446
00:32:02,684 --> 00:32:04,709
<i>So let's answer that.
Did you sleep with him?</i>

447
00:32:04,786 --> 00:32:06,310
<i>-No, I didn't.
-Okay.</i>

448
00:32:07,155 --> 00:32:09,055
I got you some take-out.

449
00:32:11,026 --> 00:32:13,654
Honey, you don't have to keep doing this.

450
00:32:13,729 --> 00:32:15,162
It's sweet of you, but--

451
00:32:15,230 --> 00:32:18,097
It's chicken and vegetables
with a ton of garlic.

452
00:32:18,901 --> 00:32:21,131
It's supposed to boost
your immune system.

453
00:32:21,203 --> 00:32:23,603
I'm not sick, Matt. I'm pregnant.

454
00:32:27,042 --> 00:32:29,943
When I asked for one of these,
Dad said no.

455
00:32:31,246 --> 00:32:34,682
I got this lecture about how I was using
only one-tenth of my brain.

456
00:32:34,750 --> 00:32:38,049
Like they say,
a brain is a terrible thing to waste.

457
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:39,587
What about yours?

458
00:32:40,422 --> 00:32:44,051
A son's brain.
Apparently a wife's is just excess baggage.

459
00:32:55,304 --> 00:32:57,795
I can't believe you're doing this again.

460
00:32:58,740 --> 00:32:59,832
What?

461
00:33:00,208 --> 00:33:02,403
Having a baby you don't want.

462
00:33:06,815 --> 00:33:08,715
What do you mean "again"?

463
00:33:16,525 --> 00:33:19,289
Maybe if you hadn't gotten pregnant
with me...

464
00:33:21,229 --> 00:33:22,958
you'd be a doctor today.

465
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:28,392
I have never regretted having
you or Annie.

466
00:33:29,438 --> 00:33:31,338
Do you understand that?

467
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:34,773
There is not a degree in the whole world...

468
00:33:34,843 --> 00:33:37,004
that would make me half as proud.

469
00:33:40,449 --> 00:33:43,714
-And once the baby's born--
-You'll go back to school?

470
00:33:46,154 --> 00:33:48,952
lsn't that what you said after I was born?

471
00:33:49,591 --> 00:33:50,990
After Annie?

472
00:33:51,827 --> 00:33:54,125
This baby's not about you, Matt.

473
00:33:54,463 --> 00:33:56,055
Is it about you?

474
00:34:06,708 --> 00:34:09,268
Do you even want to have another kid?

475
00:34:12,514 --> 00:34:15,506
Or are you just glad
to have another reason...

476
00:34:15,584 --> 00:34:18,314
why you can't go after
what you really want?

477
00:34:43,845 --> 00:34:45,472
How does it look?

478
00:34:46,948 --> 00:34:48,745
It'll be fine, Ellie...

479
00:34:49,451 --> 00:34:52,249
considering there's practically
nothing left of the septum...

480
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:55,915
and evidence that the cartilage
has been operated on previously.

481
00:34:56,158 --> 00:35:00,356
We'd like to talk to you before
your husband gets here, if that's all right.

482
00:35:06,201 --> 00:35:08,135
lt wasn't an accident, was it?

483
00:35:08,570 --> 00:35:09,867
Dave did it.

484
00:35:09,938 --> 00:35:12,668
You just said it was an accident
to protect him.

485
00:35:12,741 --> 00:35:13,765
No.

486
00:35:14,142 --> 00:35:16,576
lt won't stop
unless you want it to stop, Ellie.

487
00:35:16,645 --> 00:35:20,547
You have to know he's lying
when he promises it'll never happen again.

488
00:35:20,615 --> 00:35:22,549
What'll never happen again?

489
00:35:24,519 --> 00:35:27,386
Mr. Collins, visiting hours
aren't for another 15 minutes.

490
00:35:27,456 --> 00:35:29,151
If you could wait outside?

491
00:35:29,224 --> 00:35:32,660
Does your accident insurance
cover wife beating, Mr. Collins?

492
00:35:35,597 --> 00:35:36,928
Is that what you told them?

493
00:35:36,998 --> 00:35:40,661
She didn't have to. The inside of her face
looks like a patch quilt.

494
00:35:40,969 --> 00:35:43,699
Did you break her nose, Mr. Collins?

495
00:35:48,877 --> 00:35:49,935
Yes.

496
00:35:52,214 --> 00:35:55,274
Well, you bought her flowers,
so I guess you're even.

497
00:35:56,451 --> 00:36:00,148
I'm going to need to talk to you both.
We're required to file a report.

498
00:36:00,222 --> 00:36:01,689
I made him do it.

499
00:36:02,691 --> 00:36:03,919
Ellie...

500
00:36:04,226 --> 00:36:07,787
battered wives are often made to feel
as if they've had it coming.

501
00:36:07,863 --> 00:36:10,093
No, I forced him to break my nose.

502
00:36:10,165 --> 00:36:13,430
You never would've fixed it
if you'd known about the other operations.

503
00:36:13,502 --> 00:36:15,402
You would've been like the other doctors...

504
00:36:15,470 --> 00:36:17,404
who had said I'd done enough to my face.

505
00:36:17,472 --> 00:36:20,270
That it looked fine. But it didn't.

506
00:36:21,209 --> 00:36:22,972
My nose was hideous!

507
00:36:23,545 --> 00:36:25,513
Like some sort of freak.

508
00:36:26,014 --> 00:36:29,506
She begged me to break it
and tell you that it was an accident.

509
00:36:29,584 --> 00:36:32,815
That way you'd do the operation
with no questions asked.

510
00:36:34,322 --> 00:36:36,153
I didn't want to, but she swore:

511
00:36:36,224 --> 00:36:38,818
No more surgeries after this.

512
00:36:39,461 --> 00:36:40,928
I love Ellie.

513
00:36:41,096 --> 00:36:44,429
<i>Watching her suffer,
hating herself that way...</i>

514
00:36:44,499 --> 00:36:45,989
I couldn't stand it.

515
00:36:46,067 --> 00:36:48,763
<i>I had to do something to stop the pain.</i>

516
00:36:51,806 --> 00:36:53,671
Are you gonna report us?

517
00:36:55,243 --> 00:36:56,835
What's my crime?

518
00:36:58,246 --> 00:37:00,009
Is it loving her too much?

519
00:37:06,321 --> 00:37:08,050
Time. Pencils down.

520
00:37:08,790 --> 00:37:10,758
Pass your tests to the aisle.

521
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:29,232
Hey, I haven't seen you in a while.
Everything okay?

522
00:37:29,311 --> 00:37:31,506
Yeah, I've been
a little under the weather...

523
00:37:31,580 --> 00:37:33,480
but I wasn't gonna miss the midterm.

524
00:37:33,548 --> 00:37:36,449
Well, good.
I thought I was gonna die without you.

525
00:37:36,918 --> 00:37:40,251
It's true. I actually had to pay attention
in the lecture.

526
00:37:41,156 --> 00:37:42,987
My God, this shit is boring.

527
00:37:43,058 --> 00:37:46,425
Why is becoming a doctor so tedious...

528
00:37:47,195 --> 00:37:49,720
when playing doctor was so much fun?

529
00:37:53,001 --> 00:37:54,263
You okay?

530
00:37:56,571 --> 00:37:58,766
-Do you have a car?
-Yes. Why?

531
00:37:59,808 --> 00:38:02,208
-Can you take me to the hospital?
-Sure.

532
00:38:23,498 --> 00:38:25,227
Is this seat taken?

533
00:38:27,102 --> 00:38:28,467
lt will be.

534
00:38:29,137 --> 00:38:30,866
You're meeting someone?

535
00:38:32,574 --> 00:38:35,099
And he's keeping you waiting?
He must have balls.

536
00:38:35,176 --> 00:38:36,507
He called.

537
00:38:39,247 --> 00:38:41,875
And, yes, he's got major-league balls.

538
00:38:43,385 --> 00:38:44,909
I can take him.

539
00:38:47,022 --> 00:38:48,614
Can I buy you another drink?

540
00:38:48,690 --> 00:38:51,784
Now, that would be pointless, Dr. Troy...

541
00:38:51,860 --> 00:38:54,226
since you're the reason I'm drinking.

542
00:38:56,598 --> 00:38:58,031
Call me Christian.

543
00:38:58,099 --> 00:39:01,034
Haven't we seen enough of each other
for one day?

544
00:39:03,171 --> 00:39:05,230
How many of those have you had?

545
00:39:06,741 --> 00:39:08,299
Apparently not enough.

546
00:39:08,410 --> 00:39:10,071
I can still see you.

547
00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:13,875
Please go away.

548
00:39:17,385 --> 00:39:18,579
Look...

549
00:39:20,121 --> 00:39:21,588
I blamed you for Ellie...

550
00:39:21,656 --> 00:39:24,887
because I couldn't take responsibility
for my own negligence.

551
00:39:24,959 --> 00:39:26,426
I was an asshole.

552
00:39:28,363 --> 00:39:29,955
-I'm sorry.
-Damn it.

553
00:39:30,498 --> 00:39:31,590
What?

554
00:39:32,233 --> 00:39:35,634
No witnesses. It's like a UFO sighting.

555
00:39:35,704 --> 00:39:38,639
lt happened clear as day,
but no one will believe it.

556
00:39:38,707 --> 00:39:40,470
It's all in the delivery.

557
00:39:44,212 --> 00:39:47,272
You believed that crap Collins said
about loving Ellie so much...

558
00:39:47,349 --> 00:39:49,249
that he had to stop her pain?

559
00:39:51,052 --> 00:39:52,747
I believe he believes it.

560
00:39:53,788 --> 00:39:55,949
So you think that was what, love?

561
00:39:56,024 --> 00:39:57,924
They have a connection.

562
00:39:58,460 --> 00:40:01,190
They show each other
the darkest parts of themselves...

563
00:40:01,262 --> 00:40:04,789
without fearing
the other will run screaming for the hills.

564
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:07,468
Because they're both psycho.

565
00:40:07,602 --> 00:40:08,830
I guess.

566
00:40:11,106 --> 00:40:13,574
Still, it's a kind of sharing...

567
00:40:13,641 --> 00:40:16,235
most people won't experience
in a lifetime.

568
00:40:22,550 --> 00:40:25,713
lt gets old, doesn't it?
Looking for that person?

569
00:40:26,988 --> 00:40:28,455
Yes, it does.

570
00:40:30,191 --> 00:40:31,419
lt gets...

571
00:40:31,893 --> 00:40:34,418
absolutely exhausting.

572
00:43:00,408 --> 00:43:04,640
I'll notify the bed rest chat room
to take this off their anti-boredom list.

573
00:43:06,514 --> 00:43:09,210
lt was very sweet. Really.

574
00:43:17,425 --> 00:43:19,552
Ronald will be disappointed.

575
00:43:19,627 --> 00:43:20,685
Who?

576
00:43:20,962 --> 00:43:24,796
The guy I was interviewing
to take over during my paternity leave.

577
00:43:26,401 --> 00:43:29,564
I can't believe
you were really considering that.

578
00:43:30,638 --> 00:43:33,471
Yes, Julia, I was really considering that.

579
00:43:33,942 --> 00:43:36,775
I was actually putting you
ahead of my career.

580
00:43:36,878 --> 00:43:39,745
I know you've been doing it
for the past 16 years.

581
00:43:39,814 --> 00:43:43,147
It's not what it's cracked up to be.
You made that pretty clear.

582
00:43:43,685 --> 00:43:46,654
For God's sake, Sean!
Do you think I took the midterm...

583
00:43:46,721 --> 00:43:48,188
hoping I'd miscarry?

584
00:43:48,256 --> 00:43:49,985
You knew the risks.

585
00:43:52,060 --> 00:43:54,995
You're not the only one
who's lost a baby, Sean.

586
00:43:55,430 --> 00:43:57,830
But I was the only one who wanted one.

587
00:43:58,499 --> 00:44:01,468
You didn't even call me
to take you to the hospital.

588
00:44:01,536 --> 00:44:03,163
You asked that kid.

589
00:44:03,237 --> 00:44:05,330
He was there, that was all.

590
00:44:06,507 --> 00:44:10,568
The truth is, Julia, you didn't love me,
us, enough to even try.

591
00:44:11,045 --> 00:44:12,979
lt was too much of a sacrifice.

592
00:44:13,047 --> 00:44:16,380
I don't know where we're going, Sean.

593
00:44:17,819 --> 00:44:20,151
But if you think that by having a child...

594
00:44:20,221 --> 00:44:23,884
we can make
all our real problems go away...

595
00:44:25,193 --> 00:44:27,286
then maybe we are better off.

596
00:44:31,265 --> 00:44:33,324
You're saying you're relieved?

597
00:44:34,502 --> 00:44:37,062
Aren't you, just a little?

598
00:44:39,841 --> 00:44:43,072
Or is it easier
to live in denial and vilify me?

599
00:44:57,225 --> 00:44:58,817
It's the office.

600
00:45:03,431 --> 00:45:04,455
Hello?

601
00:45:04,532 --> 00:45:07,365
<i>Dr. McNamara, I have a call for you.
It's Leigh Moriata.</i>

602
00:45:07,435 --> 00:45:09,130
Yes, put her through.

603
00:45:14,709 --> 00:45:16,870
<i>Miss Moriata, this is Dr. McNamara.</i>

604
00:45:16,944 --> 00:45:18,468
Dr. McNamara...

605
00:45:19,547 --> 00:45:22,448
I'm calling you
from my engagement party.

606
00:45:25,486 --> 00:45:27,078
Congratulations.

607
00:45:27,155 --> 00:45:29,123
I'm glad your mother was convinced.

608
00:45:29,190 --> 00:45:31,488
She didn't buy it for a minute.

609
00:45:32,393 --> 00:45:33,621
I don't understand.

610
00:45:33,695 --> 00:45:37,153
But she could see that any guy
who was willing to change his face...

611
00:45:37,231 --> 00:45:39,461
to please his mother-in-law...

612
00:45:39,834 --> 00:45:41,859
<i>the man must really love me.</i>

613
00:45:44,238 --> 00:45:47,537
<i>If I invite you to the wedding,
would you come?</i>

614
00:45:49,310 --> 00:45:51,369
Of course, if I can.

615
00:45:52,980 --> 00:45:55,676
Thanks for telling me.
I'm very happy for you.

616
00:46:36,124 --> 00:46:37,113
Rip youyoup
