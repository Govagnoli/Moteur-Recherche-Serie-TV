1
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:02,269
Previously on Nip / Tuck...

2
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:05,909
The worst thing you can do for your son
is tip-toe around his condition.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,560
Luckily, it looks like we're gonna be
able to reconstruct his hands

4
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:09,868
with a series of surgeries.

5
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:12,599
We feel it's his best chance
to live a normal life.

6
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:16,195
Mrs. Grubman, you have
a plastic surgery addiction problem.

7
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:18,077
Holy shit, she's in V-fib.

8
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:20,993
Come on. You're not gonna
die on me, you crazy bitch.

9
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:22,593
Fix my face.

10
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:25,399
This time I can't. I'm sorry.

11
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:40,513
Just for old time's sake, tell me what
you don't like about yourself.

12
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:43,393
Dr. Troy...

13
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:44,948
Can I answer that one?

14
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:47,634
'Cause there are a few things I don't
like about Driving Miss Crazy here.

15
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:49,438
No, you can't answer that, Evetta.

16
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:52,671
If I wanted someone with an opinion,
I'd have hired Star Jones.

17
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:57,914
Well, let's see Star Jones wipe your ass
and change your Depends for $12 an hour.

18
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,310
Well, maybe if you learned to cook, I
wouldn't have diarrhea all the time.

19
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:04,119
I see the speech therapy's coming along
quite well, Mrs. G.

20
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:07,988
It had to, it's my only defense against
the verbal onslaught.

21
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:11,358
But it has been a long recovery, Dr. Troy.

22
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:13,032
A long recovery.

23
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:16,918
I couldn't stand that convalescent home
another day,

24
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,312
so I moved home and hired Evetta
for around-the-clock assistance.

25
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:23,914
I've been in seclusion
for almost two years.

26
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,991
I know. I tried to stop by and they said

27
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:27,149
you didn't wanna see me.

28
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:30,516
Now, don't take it personally, doll,
I haven't seen anyone.

29
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,511
I was so depressed about how I looked,

30
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:34,909
I wouldn't even let my own daughter
visit me.

31
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,312
You see, Dr. Troy,
I was preparing for my triumphant return.

32
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:42,073
Now, the goal was to re-emerge

33
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:46,870
at a gala affair attended by
everybody who's anybody in Miami.

34
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:50,111
And the final step before my coming out

35
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:54,637
was a visit here for a few
refresher operations.

36
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,352
Was? Why the past tense?

37
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:03,596
Well, there may not be time
for a party any longer, Dr. Troy.

38
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:08,190
You see, a few days ago,

39
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:11,798
I found out that I have
stage 4 lung cancer.

40
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:14,440
It has metastasized to
my bones and my liver.

41
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,078
There's nothing they can do.

42
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:19,948
The Grim Reaper could ask me for
a final samba at any moment.

43
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,872
Mrs. Grubman,

44
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:26,313
I'm very sorry.

45
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,075
Oh, don't be. I've accepted it.

46
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,831
But time is of the essence.

47
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,589
So, I'll need the surgeries right away.

48
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:38,509
You must be insane, Mrs. Grubman.

49
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:41,797
The stress of an invasive procedure
would be too much for you right now.

50
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:45,873
Yeah, I thought you might say that.
So we'll move on to Plan B.

51
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:48,793
You'll perform the operations after I die.

52
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:51,553
We'll make my coming out party
my funeral.

53
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:53,995
I'll be the best looking corpse
since Zsa Zsa Gabor.

54
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:58,995
Although she'd never fit into
the size two I'll be wearing in my casket.

55
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,672
Zsa Zsa's dead?

56
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:01,994
Not officially.

57
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,679
That was a good one, shitpants.

58
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:09,437
I'll need to suck 60 pounds out of you
to get you into a size 2 dress.

59
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,556
What do I care? I'll be dead.

60
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:13,392
Mrs. Grubman,

61
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:17,189
I'm your plastic surgeon.
I won't be your undertaker.

62
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,999
There is not an undertaker in Miami

63
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:24,119
who has an ounce
of your artistic talent, Dr. Troy.

64
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:26,430
My body is your canvas.

65
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:31,469
And I want you
to be the last man to touch it.

66
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,069
Hey.

67
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,793
I don't want to interrupt, I just...

68
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:38,508
Never mind. Have a great weekend.

69
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,511
What did you wanna say?

70
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:46,750
Well, I was just thinking,
how far you've come.

71
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,439
It's impressive.

72
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,471
Motherhood becomes you, Julia.

73
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,278
See you guys on Monday.

74
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,191
Have a lovely weekend.

75
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:07,556
You okay? You got in so late last night.

76
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:11,269
I was over at the anatomy lab
practicing digital nerve dissections.

77
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,635
I haven't done one since med school.

78
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:16,359
You've been dissecting fingers?

79
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,550
Do you use baby body parts?

80
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:28,868
See, this is why we shouldn't get into it.

81
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,269
I can't deal with you overreacting
to fetal cadavers.

82
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,828
You're the one who's overreacting, Sean.

83
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:41,069
You know, I mean, really,
if it were any other surgeon,

84
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:43,116
I would have a chance to ask questions.

85
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:46,431
As it is, everything I say
just seems to stress you out.

86
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:47,794
I'm just focused.

87
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:51,190
I'm trying to anticipate any and every
possible complication for our son.

88
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,350
That's a good thing, isn't it?

89
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:58,036
Yeah, of course. And I'm proud of you.

90
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,075
We're very lucky.

91
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:04,597
I mean, think of all the families who
don't have the talent or the money

92
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,432
to do what we're doing.

93
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,510
There is no money for it, Kathleen.

94
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,634
It's a vanity operation
and we can't afford it.

95
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:16,280
He's just going to have to toughen up.

96
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:18,316
We've got $5,000 saved, Tom.

97
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,356
Oh, that's brilliant, Kathleen.

98
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:22,874
Brilliant. It's his college fund.

99
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:27,112
You'd rather be the picture-perfect pretty
boy stocking shelves at the Tru Value?

100
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:29,111
No education, no prospects.

101
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:32,431
That's what she wants.
Is that what you want?

102
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:36,319
That's you in a nutshell.
Teach him to take the easy road.

103
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,992
No goddamn priorities.

104
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,479
This isn't about me!

105
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:44,432
He's being taunted and humiliated,
and he is suffering!

106
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:48,079
I love him too much to stand by
and do nothing.

107
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:52,312
And I don't love my son?
Is that where you're taking this?

108
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,391
Did I do this right, Dad?

109
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:02,758
I don't want you to think
that I'm not supportive.

110
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:09,352
No, you're right, Jules.
We're all incredibly lucky.

111
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:13,269
And I promise,
I'll schedule a sit-down at the office

112
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:16,238
and you can ask
all the questions you want.

113
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:25,028
Take the morning for yourself,
you deserve it.

114
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,634
I'll take the kids out for pancakes.

115
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,433
Thank you.

116
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:46,828
Sit here with your brother, honey,
while I put our name down.

117
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:01,038
You should try holding up
a little fish and see if he'll grab it.

118
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,838
- What?
- Leave him alone, Morgan.

119
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:06,356
He looks like a crab, Dad.
Here, baby, want a sardine?

120
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:10,349
Please don't make fun of my son's hands.

121
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,714
How would you like it if I teased you
about your pig nose, huh?

122
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,392
Or those chubby cheeks?
How would you like that?

123
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:17,357
Hey, take it easy, buddy. He's just a kid.

124
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,351
He's making fun of a handicap.

125
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:23,193
Maybe if you got your nose out of that
newspaper and paid him some attention,

126
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,111
he wouldn't be such a little asshole.

127
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,713
Don't call my son an asshole,

128
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:30,110
or your kids are gonna see
their old man get his ass kicked.

129
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,429
Daddy!

130
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:37,474
Your son's an asshole. But not
half as big an asshole as his father.

131
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,630
Let's go, honey, come on.

132
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:55,435
- Thanks for coming, Dr. Troy.
- How is she?

133
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:57,715
I told you, she stopped eating.
You gotta do something.

134
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:00,189
I gave her an IV
and she pulled it out of her arm.

135
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:01,713
That bitch has a death wish.

136
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:04,712
I know they're gonna claim elder abuse
when she finally kicks it.

137
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,518
- Why would they do that?
- Two priors, honey.

138
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,431
I got caught lifting a Gucci handbag

139
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:11,193
and slapped a cop
when he tried to fondle my sexy booty.

140
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:13,350
Nobody's going to blame you
for negligence, Evetta.

141
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:16,238
You're probably the only reason
she's still alive.

142
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,515
Just don't let her die, okay?

143
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:31,471
Slightly different circumstances
from when you were last here, Dr. Troy.

144
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,352
Though it doesn't have to be.

145
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:37,353
How about sending me out of this world
with a smile on my face?

146
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:40,997
- Why aren't you eating, Mrs. Grubman?
- I don't have time to eat.

147
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,389
There's too much work to do
on this funeral.

148
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:46,597
And the seating chart alone
has taken me four hours.

149
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:49,558
Blaine Trump's gonna need
a shoulder to cry on.

150
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:52,279
I'll just sit her right up front, next to you.

151
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,635
You're giving up, Mrs. Grubman.

152
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,992
That isn't like you.

153
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:05,994
I told you, I've had a wonderful life,
with only two regrets.

154
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:11,558
That I didn't sleep with you
when I had the chance,

155
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:15,271
and that I never got to sing
at the Rainbow Room.

156
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:19,510
The Rainbow Room?
Don't you have to be able to sing for that?

157
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,555
Listen to my demo on your way home,
you'll see.

158
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:27,872
I was gonna be Burt Bacharach's girl
before he picked Dionne Warwick.

159
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:31,873
And then I met my Marvin
and everything changed.

160
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:34,590
But you'll hear all the stories
at the funeral.

161
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:36,796
If you don't start eating, I won't be there.

162
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:40,429
You have to. You're slated to speak
right after Dominick Dunne.

163
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:42,033
I won't be a part of this.

164
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,348
If you wanna starve yourself to death

165
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:48,036
just to be a better-looking corpse,
find someone else to do your dirty work.

166
00:10:55,480 --> 00:11:00,952
These last two years
have been so lonely, you know?

167
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:07,636
Oh, I know it's my own fault,
I pushed everyone away.

168
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:12,274
Evetta does a great job,
she really tries hard to cheer me up.

169
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:15,271
I like having her around.

170
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:20,749
She fights back. Like you.

171
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:26,913
Shit, my Maybelline's running.
Hand me a tissue, would you?

172
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,479
Thank you.

173
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:36,354
I'm sorry I didn't come visit you
more often.

174
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:41,514
Oh, please. You should be out there
playing the field, Dr. Troy,

175
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:46,355
finding yourself the first in a series
of 24-year-old trophy wives.

176
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:51,148
Tell you what, I'll make you a deal.

177
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:56,238
For a spoonful of soup today,
I'll give you a Botox shot tomorrow.

178
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:00,832
I am kind of hungry.

179
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,637
I love you, you know.

180
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:32,068
You know what? Let him sue me.
It was worth it. Sick asshole.

181
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:39,397
Just say it, you think I should
go back to anger management. What?

182
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:43,917
What really concerns me, Sean,
is what all this intensity is about.

183
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:46,510
You didn't hear him being mocked
in front of a dozen strangers,

184
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:47,828
in front of Annie.

185
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,114
All I knew in that moment was that

186
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,953
people like them would be tormenting
my son for the rest of his life.

187
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:53,109
I had to do something.

188
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:56,556
You are doing something.
You're doing his surgery.

189
00:12:56,640 --> 00:13:00,235
For now, just promise me you'll talk
to this Mr. Thompson.

190
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:04,472
Apologize to him, so that we don't have
to deal with the headache of a lawsuit.

191
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,198
Will you do that?

192
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:09,198
I'm also gonna call Dr. Mugavi
and move up the surgery.

193
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:12,158
There's no reason to wait.
I'll be ready to go in two weeks.

194
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,673
But he's still so little.

195
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:16,399
The sooner I do this surgery,
the sooner he can begin developing

196
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:20,473
the coordination and function in his hands.
It's all he's gonna have.

197
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:29,559
Who are you doing this for, Sean?
You or Conor?

198
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:43,919
You stay right there.

199
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:02,075
Holy cow.

200
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:10,514
This one looks like it's out of here!

201
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:17,630
He's rounding third,
it's a race for the plate.

202
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:21,950
It's a home run!

203
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:28,438
When can I sign up for Little League, Dad?

204
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:32,475
Gee, thanks, buddy.
I come out here, play ball with you

205
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:33,913
and that's what you've got to say?

206
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:34,989
No,

207
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:40,792
I really like playing with you, it's just...
I just wanna play a real game.

208
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:42,993
You and your mother.

209
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:49,110
The kids'll laugh at you
and the coach'll keep you on the bench,

210
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:53,273
then stick you out in right field
for the last inning.

211
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:57,429
Oh, and they'll shove you in the back
for the team photo.

212
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,711
Is that what you want?

213
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:05,476
What are you doing here?

214
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:09,596
I called your house,
your wife told me you'd be here.

215
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,473
You have a moment to talk,
Mr. Thompson?

216
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,909
- I'm sorry I hit you.
- Yeah, I bet you are.

217
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,592
'Cause it's gonna cost you, McNamara.

218
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:21,990
I got 20 witnesses
that will swear to what they saw.

219
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:24,794
I never should have erupted like I did.

220
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:27,952
I just... My son...

221
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:31,515
He's about to have an operation
on his hands.

222
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:34,194
You humiliated me in front of my boy.

223
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:39,836
Looks like you two are working through it.

224
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,714
Yeah.

225
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:43,756
I had to explain to him
that what I did was wrong,

226
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:48,072
what he did was wrong,
and what you did was really, really wrong.

227
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:50,794
I think... I think he gets it now.

228
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:54,589
- What position does he play?
- Shortstop.

229
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:57,072
I mean, he's a little slower than
the other kids,

230
00:15:57,160 --> 00:16:01,551
but he did turn a double-play last night.
It won them the game.

231
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:05,793
Every kid should have a moment like that.

232
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:09,914
A walk-off home run, a buzzer beater.

233
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,038
It's all I want for Conor.

234
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:21,156
He may never get that chance,
but all I want is for him to be normal.

235
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:31,391
Look, do what you gotta do
with the lawsuit.

236
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:36,035
I just wanted to apologize
for what I did and what I said.

237
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:44,795
These webbed fingers
are known as syndactyly.

238
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,791
There are actually two fingers inside here.

239
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:50,395
We do a syndactyly release
on the index and middle finger,

240
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:54,110
and another one
between the ring and the pinky.

241
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:57,033
And what kind of complications
could arise?

242
00:16:57,200 --> 00:17:01,637
Oh, I'm so sorry I'm late.
There was this accident on the Causeway.

243
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:05,679
Marlowe's going to be involved
in Conor's care, so I asked him to join us.

244
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:08,957
Please, I'm sorry, don't mind me.
Please continue.

245
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:12,431
Let me get you a chair.

246
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:20,715
The main complication that could arise

247
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:23,917
is that the vessel or the nerve
could be damaged in the process.

248
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,752
Will you have to do a skin graft?

249
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:27,319
The short answer is yes, Julia, but...

250
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:30,472
Is that a very invasive procedure?
Will there be a lot of pain?

251
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:32,312
He'll be under anesthesia.

252
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,755
I was talking about his recovery.

253
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:37,513
We're pretty good with pain management.

254
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:41,755
Which brings us to the thumb distraction.

255
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:46,471
Now, we plan to turn this small
suggestion of a digit into a real thumb.

256
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,679
We make an incision in the thumb,

257
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:52,150
dissect the bone and apply
a distraction osteogenesis device.

258
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:55,277
It has little pins and screws
that go into the bone.

259
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:57,510
We sew the thumb back up
and over the next weeks,

260
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:01,434
we slowly turn the screws
and they basically stretch the bone.

261
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,595
Who turns these screws
over the next few weeks?

262
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:05,749
You do.

263
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:07,671
We've found that the pain level
is minimal to next to nothing

264
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,159
when the parents are the ones
to turn them.

265
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:11,629
How do you measure those pain levels,
if I may ask?

266
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:14,314
Oh, we doctors, we've got
all kinds of tricks up our sleeves.

267
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,391
That was a reasonable question, Christian.

268
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:19,392
Well, I'm only asking because according
to the research I've been reading,

269
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:23,837
the traditional ways of measuring
infant pain, tears and brain activity,

270
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:26,673
it's just not as conclusive
as we wish it was.

271
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:29,593
Are you aware of the expertise, mastery
and professional status

272
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:31,636
that's gathered in this room?

273
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:34,598
With all due respect,
Julia asked me to be here today

274
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:37,752
to bring up some of these issues.
In other words, I'm doing my job.

275
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:41,350
I'm sorry if that knocks anyone's nose
out of joint.

276
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:46,029
So, what is this research, Marlowe?

277
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:49,829
Some well-respected developmental
psychologists have done hypnoses

278
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:52,957
on a pretty large group of adults
who had surgery at an early age.

279
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:54,712
They all tend to have similar symptoms,

280
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:58,679
nervous system disorders,
digestive problems, debilitating phobia

281
00:18:58,760 --> 00:18:59,875
and panic attacks.

282
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:01,757
Are you aware of this, Sean?

283
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:04,479
I scheduled this meeting so you could
meet Dr. Mugavi

284
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,437
and ask specific questions
about the surgery.

285
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:10,115
I think the whole New Age
healing modality type of conversation

286
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,758
is better suited to the dinner table.

287
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:14,195
Well, in that case,
I'm gonna go home and make dinner

288
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:17,192
so that I can have that conversation.

289
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:20,670
Dr. Mugavi, Christian, feel free to join us.

290
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:37,439
Well, look at you two!

291
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:39,158
Burberry never looked so good
on Kate Moss.

292
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:42,994
Oh, you like it?
I had Evetta pick it up for me at Neiman's.

293
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:45,071
And she's lucky I made her wear a bib
at breakfast.

294
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:47,833
Otherwise, it'd have been covered in
strawberry crepe shit.

295
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:51,356
I also wore a huge hat,
so no one would recognize me.

296
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:55,638
But you were right, Dr. Troy,
not eating was a silly thing to do.

297
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:59,759
Oh, we had the most wonderful brunch
this morning at Restaurant St. Michel.

298
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:02,400
Eating out in public? That's fantastic.

299
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,789
Baby, it was like opening the gates to hell.

300
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:07,917
Anything on the menu with cheese,
beef, or cream in it,

301
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,672
Fatty Belt-Buckles had to have two.

302
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:12,877
Well, look who's talking.
I never saw anyone order

303
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:15,793
lobster and a chocolate milkshake
for breakfast before.

304
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:19,111
I figured if the old goat's gonna be
spending my inheritance,

305
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,428
I'm gonna enjoy it.

306
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:23,478
Though maybe I should've stopped with
the milkshake.

307
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:27,473
We can get you some liposuction, Evetta,
if you're worried about your weight.

308
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:29,792
I was talking about my heartburn, dummy.

309
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:32,189
I don't need no Hoover vacuum
stealing my ass.

310
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:35,198
Where I come from, I don't get lipo
to attract a man,

311
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:39,478
I eat another cherry pie and put more junk
in my trunk, know what I'm saying?

312
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:41,357
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to offend you.

313
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:45,069
Drum up your work with some
pitiful, self-hating creature, Dr. Troy.

314
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:49,153
Not me, okay?
I love myself. Every pound of it.

315
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:50,998
Go read a magazine in the lobby, Evetta.

316
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:52,672
I hear the new issue of Essence is here.

317
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:56,230
Yeah, I'll go read my Essence. I was tired
of talking to the two of you, anyway.

318
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:59,039
And stop shutting me up.
Always trying to get sucked and tucked,

319
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:02,112
that's what's wrong with your
crazy ass now.

320
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,633
I should go talk to her.

321
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:07,156
Oh, she'll be all right.
She's a spitfire though, huh?

322
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:12,909
Oh, breakfast was fun.
And thank God no one recognized me.

323
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:17,039
Well, after a few shots of Botox,
the old Mrs. Grubman will reappear.

324
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:20,999
A shot of Botox is the elixir of life,
Dr. Troy.

325
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:22,991
It's getting out in public
and seeing people again

326
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:25,878
that makes you feel good, Mrs. Grubman.

327
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,916
Oh, Mrs. Grubman.

328
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:16,112
- Julia...
- Listen to this.

329
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:20,716
"I saw these masked giants hovering
over me,

330
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:23,598
"the cold harsh light was in my eyes.

331
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:25,989
"Someone came toward me
with a black mask

332
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:28,435
"that had this smell and it made me sick.

333
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:30,875
"When I woke up, I started to vomit.

334
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:35,192
"A stranger shoved a huge teddy bear
at me, the eyes were terrifying. "

335
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:39,833
This memory is from
when he was seven months old.

336
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:41,759
It's the book you gave me.

337
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:42,829
Julia, I'm sorry.

338
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:44,956
I should've thought more carefully
about what I was doing.

339
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:47,270
But I'm so grateful to you.

340
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:51,672
You know, I knew these things
instinctively, I just hadn't articulated it.

341
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:54,832
A baby responds to surgery
as if he's dying,

342
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:58,230
because he has no understanding
of what's happening to him.

343
00:22:58,320 --> 00:22:59,355
Julia, listen to me...

344
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:02,273
We have to convince Sean
to postpone the surgery.

345
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:04,396
You know, at least until Conor's older,
you know?

346
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,630
So we can prepare him for it.

347
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:09,075
I'm not gonna sign
the surgery consent form.

348
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:11,390
Okay, but before you make any decisions,

349
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:14,517
let me tell you what I've decided.
I'm leaving.

350
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:19,474
You're what?

351
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:21,710
I don't...
I don't know how it ended up like this,

352
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:26,112
but it's clear that I've become
a disruptive influence in this household.

353
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:29,556
And that's not good for anyone,
especially not Conor.

354
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:41,308
Do you know the difference between
a surgeon and God?

355
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,710
God doesn't think he's a surgeon.

356
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:50,512
Now, I need you to stay,
to help me through this.

357
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:54,112
You're my rock.
I can't go through this alone.

358
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:57,078
You underestimate
how powerful you are, Julia.

359
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:59,879
And these books,
they have concrete suggestions

360
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:02,520
on how to help Conor through this.

361
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:03,874
It won't be the end of the world.

362
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:05,712
I can't... I just...

363
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:18,833
The thought of waking up
tomorrow and not seeing you...

364
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:24,471
You'll... You'll get through this.

365
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:26,516
You're a really good mother.

366
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:55,710
That's why I have to leave.

367
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:25,030
Thought I'd give you a hand today.

368
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:30,716
She's dead, Christian.

369
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:31,915
She's not gonna catch anything.

370
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,831
It's her last time in the saddle, Sean.

371
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:36,718
Might as well give her the full treatment.

372
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:37,789
Okay.

373
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:44,875
Linda told me you're doing the eulogy
at her funeral.

374
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:48,589
Yeah, but I'm struggling with
what I'm gonna say.

375
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:52,275
All Miami's gonna be there.
She sent out engraved invitations.

376
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:53,349
All I can think of is,

377
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:55,078
"Here lies a woman
who was so busy looking in the mirror

378
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:58,869
"and feeling she wasn't good enough
that she missed her life. "

379
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:02,670
She could have had a singing career,
did you know that?

380
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:06,196
I didn't know much about her besides
her desperate, overbearing personality.

381
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:09,113
Yeah, she wasn't such a bad egg.

382
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:11,358
But I'd certainly feel more comfortable

383
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:13,670
if I could stand up there
knowing that my contribution to her life

384
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:17,389
was a little more positive.

385
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:20,030
I feel like her drug-dealer.

386
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:22,912
You can't think like that.

387
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:27,391
I seem to recall a diatribe by you only
a few months ago about how we were

388
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:32,156
contributing to a society that was
obsessed with physical perfection.

389
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:34,435
At the moment, I'm grateful for
every single surgery

390
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:37,557
that's given me the skill
to make my son whole.

391
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:41,078
What if you couldn't fix Conor?

392
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:45,312
What if you couldn't make him
as close to perfect as possible?

393
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:49,470
How would that make you feel?

394
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:51,755
Have you been talking to my wife?

395
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:53,717
All I'm getting from
the people around me lately

396
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:56,917
is this touchy-feely
negative psychobabble.

397
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,878
Whoa, killer, it's not me you're mad at.

398
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:01,473
Maybe you should take the afternoon off.

399
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:04,028
Go home, make peace with your wife.

400
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:09,994
Besides, I could use the alone time
with Grubman to work out my eulogy.

401
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:25,310
Would you mind
changing the music, Linda?

402
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:30,153
Gangsta rap just doesn't seem like
the right choice for Mrs. Grubman.

403
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,800
I brought something. It's over there.

404
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:08,394
Ladies and gentlemen, Mrs. Grubman.

405
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:12,873
Thanks, Burt.

406
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:59,716
Don't forget your glove, Sean.

407
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:05,118
Go on, it's after 4:00, you're gonna miss it.

408
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:07,191
What'll I do if they laugh at me?

409
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:11,273
They're fools if they laugh,
and who cares what fools think?

410
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:14,272
- Dad's gonna be mad.
- I'll handle Dad, honey.

411
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:16,789
Now go on.

412
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:40,670
What're you doing home so early?

413
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:47,435
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

414
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:51,788
- We need to talk.
- Yes, Sean, we do.

415
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:54,950
I'm not ready to sign the consent form.

416
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:56,268
I know.

417
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:02,199
I know I've been kind of a madman lately,
I've been so obsessed with

418
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:04,589
making things perfect for Conor's surgery

419
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:09,117
and I see how counterproductive
that's been and unfair to you.

420
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:11,031
There are things that...

421
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:15,995
That I've never told you.

422
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:20,312
- About the surgery?
- No. About me.

423
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,957
What's he doing here?

424
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:43,914
- Am I too late?
- No. No, your timing's perfect.

425
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:46,835
Did you bring a signed consent form?
One of these?

426
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:48,188
Yeah, right here.

427
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:53,992
Great. Okay, next.
All right, stand on the line.

428
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:56,674
I'm gonna give you a count, give me
a good home run. Boom, pow. All right?

429
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:59,354
Home run, one, two.

430
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:01,476
Okay, get the next one in.

431
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:13,636
You wanna lower your arm a little bit?
Let me see some more face. How about it?

432
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:21,116
When did you have the surgery?
Who paid for it?

433
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:22,633
I was 8.

434
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:25,712
My mother used the college money,
we did it behind my dad's back.

435
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:29,634
Lucky for everyone I was a good student
and qualified for financial aid.

436
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:31,631
But he never forgave her.

437
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:34,277
He left a few months later.

438
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:36,510
That's why he left you guys?

439
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:40,354
It always seemed such a mystery to me.

440
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:45,235
I think he felt like he lost control
of the family. I guess we

441
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:48,998
pushed him out.

442
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:52,748
My mom worked two jobs to support us.

443
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:57,038
I just don't understand
why you didn't tell me.

444
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:58,838
'Cause I put that pathetic kid behind me.

445
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:00,478
No, you didn't.

446
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:03,870
That kid is why you're a plastic surgeon.

447
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:07,915
Why did you have to keep it a secret?

448
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:21,312
I couldn't let you see me
as that pathetic, ugly kid.

449
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:26,273
I was afraid that's all you'd ever see.

450
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:35,554
And in so many ways that little kid

451
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:38,990
is who I fell in love with.

452
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:41,355
Only because you never saw him.

453
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:11,436
Where is everyone, Evetta?

454
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:14,349
I guess they had better things to do.

455
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:17,113
Didn't you send out
all the invitations for her?

456
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:18,792
Every single one.

457
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:22,190
Maybe her address book was out of date
or something.

458
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:24,195
Her daughter, Claire?

459
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:25,998
She couldn't find the time to come to
her mother's funeral?

460
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:30,557
Claire called the house, said that her
mother died for her almost two years ago,

461
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:33,916
when she stopped seeing her
after she had the stroke.

462
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,753
Said that when she chose
vanity over family,

463
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:39,229
it was too much for her to handle.

464
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:42,079
Did you hear
what she put on her headstone?

465
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:45,632
"I came, I saw, I conga'd. "

466
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:51,394
Oh, Grubby, we did have
some fun times together.

467
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:54,834
Too bad you screwed me in your will.

468
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:58,514
Yeah, all I got was
a few old-lady muumuus.

469
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:02,237
I guess she thought I meant it
when I told her I liked them.

470
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:05,073
Either that or her last joke's on me.

471
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:08,312
Which I guess it is anyway.

472
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:14,239
Okay, well, I gotta go find a new job.

473
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:17,549
I'll see you next week, Dr. Troy.

474
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:21,239
Next week. What... What's next week?

475
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:25,233
Oh, I made an appointment
at McNamara/Troy.

476
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:30,075
Since she left you everything, I'm
at least gonna get some free lipo out of it.

477
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:33,318
She left me all her money?

478
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:34,958
You didn't hear? It's in her will.

479
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:38,191
She put it all in
the Hedda Grubman Plastic Surgery Fund.

480
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:42,068
For people that need a little work
but don't wanna pay for it.

481
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:31,914
I'm here to pay respects to
Hedda Grubman.

482
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:35,556
Her life was like that of any other,

483
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:37,358
filled with accomplishments
that should be exalted,

484
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:40,159
and regrets that should be learned from.

485
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:44,999
Her wit and candor...

486
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:54,393
This is bullshit.

487
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:02,310
The truth is, Mrs. Grubman,
you were a huge pain in the ass.

488
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:05,153
Pretty much everybody hated you.

489
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:08,073
It's no wonder they boycotted
your funeral.

490
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:11,432
You were obsessed with your looks
and plastic surgery

491
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:15,399
and in the end it cost you
every relationship you ever had.

492
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:21,797
But I know somewhere inside,

493
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:27,352
you meant well.

494
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:35,999
And you were funny, and honest,
and you stuck up for yourself.

495
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:41,790
I loved the fact
that you never let me off the hook.

496
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:49,551
Life was more interesting
