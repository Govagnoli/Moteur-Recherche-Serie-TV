1
00:00:01,768 --> 00:00:02,990
Previously on Nip/Tuck...

2
00:00:03,036 --> 00:00:03,768
What the hell's going on?

3
00:00:03,789 --> 00:00:06,610
Christian Troy, you are under arrest for the murder of Rhea Reynolds.

4
00:00:06,650 --> 00:00:10,435
This is gonna cost Christian everything he has if it goes to trial.

5
00:00:10,485 --> 00:00:12,503
Would you still stay in business with him?

6
00:00:12,558 --> 00:00:13,685
Of course I would.

7
00:00:13,741 --> 00:00:16,593
They found the tranquilizer in your apartment, Christian.

8
00:00:17,258 --> 00:00:19,108
You need to believe me, Sean.

9
00:00:21,153 --> 00:00:21,939
You're free to go.

10
00:00:22,001 --> 00:00:22,768
Why?

11
00:00:22,819 --> 00:00:24,980
I guess the real carver struck again last night.

12
00:00:25,037 --> 00:00:26,835
Half our appointments canceled this week.

13
00:00:26,887 --> 00:00:29,333
Right now, we have no surgeries on the books.

14
00:00:46,102 --> 00:00:47,078
Jesus.

15
00:00:48,103 --> 00:00:49,474
Was this a shark attack?

16
00:00:49,588 --> 00:00:50,949
Uterine cancer.

17
00:00:52,562 --> 00:00:54,387
I'm not sure we understand, Glenn.

18
00:00:54,904 --> 00:00:59,116
2 days ago, a man came in to retrieve his deceased wife's wedding ring.

19
00:00:59,288 --> 00:01:01,543
Normally, possessions are returned before cremation,

20
00:01:01,578 --> 00:01:04,067
and his wife's remains had been scheduled a week ago.

21
00:01:04,103 --> 00:01:06,402
But since he never received the ring,

22
00:01:06,607 --> 00:01:10,841
we checked down here to see if it had accidentally been left behind.

23
00:01:11,067 --> 00:01:13,872
And we're glad we did.

24
00:01:18,968 --> 00:01:20,015
Thank you.

25
00:01:21,158 --> 00:01:25,105
Our crematorium operator, Silas Prine,

26
00:01:25,192 --> 00:01:30,461
made this unused storage room his own private hideaway.

27
00:01:30,548 --> 00:01:34,889
We discovered 4 bodies, all young women in their twenties to thirties,

28
00:01:34,966 --> 00:01:37,428
each one missing a limb,

29
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:42,594
each one scheduled for cremation weeks or even months ago.

30
00:01:43,844 --> 00:01:44,802
And then...

31
00:01:46,523 --> 00:01:48,739
we found this.

32
00:01:56,798 --> 00:02:00,007
So the appendages are from different bodies?

33
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:04,290
It looks as if your crematorium operator has been embalming her for preservation,

34
00:02:04,367 --> 00:02:06,803
like they do with cadavers for anatomical study.

35
00:02:06,875 --> 00:02:10,438
That's correct. We're just not sure where he learned to do it.

36
00:02:10,603 --> 00:02:13,952
Embalming is the mortician's job, not the crematorium operator.

37
00:02:14,007 --> 00:02:15,667
Sounds like a lonely job.

38
00:02:15,799 --> 00:02:18,109
Prine is the quiet kind.

39
00:02:18,279 --> 00:02:20,842
We actually don't know much about him.

40
00:02:20,965 --> 00:02:23,843
He's a loner. No family, no relatives we could find.

41
00:02:23,904 --> 00:02:26,386
Speaking of family, I assume those of the deceased--

42
00:02:26,416 --> 00:02:29,760
They've all been notified and have agreed to keep it quiet for a substantial settlement

43
00:02:29,781 --> 00:02:35,420
while we rectify the situation, which is where you come in.

44
00:02:38,050 --> 00:02:39,321
I don't understand.

45
00:02:39,382 --> 00:02:41,650
Aren't they all gonna be cremated anyway?

46
00:02:41,735 --> 00:02:46,432
We'd be working with necrotic tissue, which would make reconstruction very, very difficult.

47
00:02:46,484 --> 00:02:49,992
Only when these bodies are whole can these women finally rest in peace.

48
00:02:50,166 --> 00:02:52,013
We just don't do this type of work.

49
00:02:52,042 --> 00:02:58,222
It's highly unusual, I know, but I am willing to pay whatever you need.

50
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:02,228
We've had some bad press lately.

51
00:03:02,314 --> 00:03:03,697
We're trying to clean up our image.

52
00:03:03,753 --> 00:03:06,529
I fully intend on keeping this quiet.

53
00:03:06,651 --> 00:03:08,715
If the media ever caught wind of what happened,

54
00:03:08,782 --> 00:03:11,413
Easley Mortuaries would never recover.

55
00:03:14,199 --> 00:03:15,847
Nobody needs to know.

56
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:19,385
We can come back after our scheduled surgery today,

57
00:03:19,463 --> 00:03:21,920
and it should take 3-4 hours tops.

58
00:03:22,539 --> 00:03:27,905
Actually, there is one more problem that may cause this to take some time.

59
00:03:29,424 --> 00:03:31,770
We can't locate one of the bodies.

60
00:03:32,093 --> 00:03:35,207
One of the arms or legs doesn't have an owner?

61
00:03:37,341 --> 00:03:38,462
The head.

62
00:03:39,544 --> 00:03:43,894
We don't know where the head came from or who it belongs to.

63
00:03:44,001 --> 00:03:47,274
And Prine isn't talking.

64
00:04:39,013 --> 00:04:42,507
Count back from 10 for me, Mrs. Hansen-tagen.

65
00:04:42,734 --> 00:04:44,723
What did you say ?

66
00:04:47,777 --> 00:04:49,682
One, two...

67
00:04:50,988 --> 00:04:53,226
One, two...

68
00:04:54,188 --> 00:04:55,243
Forget it.

69
00:04:57,254 --> 00:05:00,096
The next time we get a german tourist as a patient,

70
00:05:00,142 --> 00:05:04,935
we might want to make sure that we are able to understand what they're saying

71
00:05:05,085 --> 00:05:07,409
before we do any invasive procedures.

72
00:05:07,469 --> 00:05:11,140
Neck lipo is neck lipo, Liz, no matter how you say it.

73
00:05:12,196 --> 00:05:13,752
Actually, I take that back.

74
00:05:13,812 --> 00:05:18,058
In Mrs. Hansen-Tagen's case, it's a reprieve from being confused with a basset hound.

75
00:05:18,565 --> 00:05:20,152
And now that our website's been shut down,

76
00:05:20,203 --> 00:05:23,479
I doubt we'll have any more international customers anytime soon.

77
00:05:25,969 --> 00:05:30,147
I consider it a blessing that Mrs. Hansen-Tagen doesn't know english, actually.

78
00:05:30,432 --> 00:05:32,261
She's the last patient on our books--

79
00:05:32,337 --> 00:05:35,380
the only one who hasn't canceled because of the carver accusations.

80
00:05:35,452 --> 00:05:38,558
That's not true, Sean. You said no to the job at the mortuary.

81
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:40,960
The money he offered would have gotten us through this dry spell.

82
00:05:41,006 --> 00:05:43,956
Right now, we have no choice but to take whatever comes our way.

83
00:05:44,005 --> 00:05:45,133
Yes, we do.

84
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:48,251
Especially when the job will hurt our reputation further.

85
00:05:48,511 --> 00:05:50,612
And reconstructing dead bodies for cremation

86
00:05:50,663 --> 00:05:53,499
won't lead to the sort of clientele I'm interested in having.

87
00:05:54,175 --> 00:05:55,875
We need to make money, Sean.

88
00:05:55,942 --> 00:05:57,625
I can't afford to do this anymore.

89
00:05:57,711 --> 00:06:00,493
My nest egg has been cracked and scrambled.

90
00:06:00,835 --> 00:06:02,550
We'll get through this, Christian.

91
00:06:02,786 --> 00:06:04,245
We always have before.

92
00:06:04,313 --> 00:06:06,980
And I know that after your divorce and buying Julia's half of the house,

93
00:06:07,025 --> 00:06:08,878
you're not exactly rolling in it.

94
00:06:09,361 --> 00:06:11,527
No, I can't say that I am.

95
00:06:11,879 --> 00:06:14,982
So, what are we gonna do?

96
00:06:15,730 --> 00:06:17,615
If something doesn't come our way soon,

97
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:21,341
then your high standards are gonna send us all on long vacations.

98
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:26,405
We're just gonna have to make some tough decisions, that's all.

99
00:06:34,289 --> 00:06:36,615
So it's been really bad at work, huh?

100
00:06:36,691 --> 00:06:39,261
I think Sean blames me for the drop in business.

101
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:43,015
Would you want to be operated on by the guy who was accused of being the carver?

102
00:06:43,244 --> 00:06:47,428
Well, I might let you give me some new tits if it'll help with advertising.

103
00:06:49,138 --> 00:06:52,323
Though you did save my life when I showed up sick and dying.

104
00:06:52,569 --> 00:06:54,596
You look like you're doing ok, Gina.

105
00:06:54,688 --> 00:06:56,240
Yeah. You know, I'm ok.

106
00:06:56,254 --> 00:07:01,364
My viral load is down. My t-cell count's been really high.

107
00:07:01,467 --> 00:07:05,415
I've been going to the gym, eating well.

108
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:10,974
I've even had time to take a real estate class down at the community college.

109
00:07:13,059 --> 00:07:15,747
That'll make this a little easier then.

110
00:07:16,556 --> 00:07:19,537
I can't pay for your rent or your car lease anymore.

111
00:07:20,059 --> 00:07:21,584
That's not funny, asshole.

112
00:07:21,630 --> 00:07:24,109
I'll still pay for your prescriptions, but after this month,

113
00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:26,197
you're on your own for the rest.

114
00:07:27,079 --> 00:07:30,370
I'm sorry. I wish I could continue to help, but--

115
00:07:30,425 --> 00:07:31,824
You asshole.

116
00:07:32,069 --> 00:07:33,939
God, I should have known I couldn't count on you.

117
00:07:33,984 --> 00:07:36,898
You are a worthless sack of shit!

118
00:07:37,230 --> 00:07:39,367
For god sakes, keep your voice down.

119
00:07:39,683 --> 00:07:40,983
Why are you being so hostile?

120
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:43,968
Because I was gonna ask you for a loan today.

121
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:46,969
So you're admitting that you irresponsibly blew

122
00:07:47,016 --> 00:07:49,320
through all of the money that I've been giving you.

123
00:07:49,704 --> 00:07:50,493
Nice.

124
00:07:50,519 --> 00:07:52,392
I didn't blow through the money, asshole.

125
00:07:52,464 --> 00:07:54,675
I've been saving the leftover pittance,

126
00:07:54,737 --> 00:07:56,750
but it isn't enough to make the investment I want to make.

127
00:07:56,801 --> 00:07:58,792
That's why I need a goddamn loan.

128
00:07:58,884 --> 00:08:00,871
You know, I'm finally about to do something with my life,

129
00:08:00,917 --> 00:08:02,888
and you have to pull the rug out from under me!

130
00:08:02,914 --> 00:08:04,684
This wasn't alimony, you ungrateful bitch.

131
00:08:04,741 --> 00:08:06,825
You should have been thanking me for the money I did give you!

132
00:08:06,875 --> 00:08:10,921
I hope your business goes in the shitter and you have to come crawling to me for a job.

133
00:08:19,688 --> 00:08:22,488
I'm sure we all can benefit from the new aerobic stretches.

134
00:08:22,503 --> 00:08:25,877
Thank you, Mr. Davies of East Bay Gym.

135
00:08:26,015 --> 00:08:29,128
Well, next in our wednesday lecture series on health and beauty,

136
00:08:29,179 --> 00:08:31,868
please welcome Dr. Sean McNamara,

137
00:08:31,924 --> 00:08:36,245
who's come today to talk about the new, exciting developments in plastic surgery.

138
00:08:39,347 --> 00:08:40,315
Thank you.

139
00:08:40,433 --> 00:08:47,084
As nurse Stevens said, I'm Dr. Sean McNamara and I'm a plastic surgeon.

140
00:08:48,096 --> 00:08:52,869
Um... is there anyone here who's had a reconstructive procedure?

141
00:08:53,933 --> 00:08:56,028
Yes, ma'am. What have you had done?

142
00:08:56,146 --> 00:08:58,922
I had a hip replaced.

143
00:08:59,926 --> 00:09:01,410
I see.

144
00:09:01,892 --> 00:09:03,591
Well, that's a little different.

145
00:09:03,663 --> 00:09:06,745
A hip replacement is done by an orthopedic surgeon.

146
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:14,824
Let me put it to you a different way.

147
00:09:15,438 --> 00:09:17,297
Have you ever looked in the mirror

148
00:09:18,132 --> 00:09:21,711
and thought, "those crow's feet around my eyes really bother me"

149
00:09:21,803 --> 00:09:27,123
or "if I could just get rid of that tire around my midsection, I'd feel 10 years younger"?

150
00:09:27,287 --> 00:09:28,597
Well, if you have,

151
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,963
uh... if...

152
00:09:34,162 --> 00:09:35,175
um...

153
00:09:37,194 --> 00:09:38,064
uh...

154
00:09:38,736 --> 00:09:43,435
if you have, plastic surgery might be the solution for you.

155
00:09:44,567 --> 00:09:45,232
Yes?

156
00:09:45,309 --> 00:09:47,260
Isn't this pretty expensive?

157
00:09:47,335 --> 00:09:51,202
My daughter's brow lift cost $5,000.

158
00:09:51,693 --> 00:09:55,227
Some procedures are more expensive than others, yes, ma'am.

159
00:09:55,293 --> 00:10:00,556
But at McNamara/Troy, we will find a payment option to fit the patient's lifestyle.

160
00:10:00,935 --> 00:10:04,698
And right now we're offering a special through the end of the year.

161
00:10:04,765 --> 00:10:06,875
If you come in for one procedure,

162
00:10:07,314 --> 00:10:09,527
the second is only half price.

163
00:10:16,014 --> 00:10:18,236
Gina.

164
00:10:19,807 --> 00:10:22,998
Well, this is a surprise.

165
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:24,959
Can I come in?

166
00:10:25,466 --> 00:10:26,340
Yeah.

167
00:10:33,612 --> 00:10:36,771
I can't believe you didn't know I was hiv positive.

168
00:10:38,153 --> 00:10:41,415
Christian and I aren't as close as we used to be.

169
00:10:42,397 --> 00:10:45,725
I guess you and Sean have other things to talk about.

170
00:10:45,911 --> 00:10:47,456
You could say that.

171
00:10:48,756 --> 00:10:51,772
Listen, Julia, the reason that I'm here is...

172
00:10:51,849 --> 00:10:54,189
there's something I've wanted to tell you.

173
00:10:56,242 --> 00:10:57,487
I admire you.

174
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:01,423
Well, I've been working really hard to put my life back together

175
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:06,611
and one of the things that I'm trying to do is surround myself with people I respect.

176
00:11:07,629 --> 00:11:09,534
You're at the top of my list.

177
00:11:10,542 --> 00:11:14,183
Well, I'm flattered, really, but,

178
00:11:14,239 --> 00:11:17,715
god, I'm not sure I deserve to be put on a pedestal.

179
00:11:17,756 --> 00:11:19,902
You know, I'm a divorcee with no job,

180
00:11:19,963 --> 00:11:23,173
living in a short-term apartment with a 10-year-old

181
00:11:23,214 --> 00:11:26,143
and a high schooler who's pretty messed up.

182
00:11:26,410 --> 00:11:28,120
But you have dignity.

183
00:11:29,994 --> 00:11:31,949
That's something I've always wanted.

184
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:41,263
You know, Christian told me the business was failing.

185
00:11:41,291 --> 00:11:42,378
Really?

186
00:11:42,465 --> 00:11:46,644
Well, I saw Sean the other day. He didn't say anything.

187
00:11:46,736 --> 00:11:49,947
I guess the bad press has been really hard on them.

188
00:11:53,208 --> 00:11:57,600
Sean hasn't missed any alimony or child-support payments, has he?

189
00:11:57,662 --> 00:11:58,661
No.

190
00:11:59,506 --> 00:12:02,004
We just reached a settlement with the house,

191
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:06,607
and he's been really supportive since the divorce.

192
00:12:06,688 --> 00:12:09,760
Well, I know Sean would never do anything to hurt his children,

193
00:12:09,814 --> 00:12:12,458
but take it from me, Julia.

194
00:12:12,578 --> 00:12:15,690
There is a lot to be said for making money with the money you've been given

195
00:12:15,741 --> 00:12:19,059
so you're not left vulnerable when the--

196
00:12:20,605 --> 00:12:23,600
when the money tree gets dutch elm disease.

197
00:12:26,053 --> 00:12:29,811
Have you thought about how you're going to invest the money from the house?

198
00:12:34,564 --> 00:12:37,875
I wish you had called me before you went to Dr. Jordan.

199
00:12:40,527 --> 00:12:42,234
Next time, call me first.

200
00:12:43,594 --> 00:12:44,586
Ok.

201
00:12:45,719 --> 00:12:46,738
You, too.

202
00:12:47,684 --> 00:12:48,566
Bye.

203
00:12:55,099 --> 00:12:56,265
How's it going?

204
00:12:56,680 --> 00:13:00,941
I haven't struck out like this since there was a rumor I had genital warts.

205
00:13:02,194 --> 00:13:03,797
You're not alone.

206
00:13:07,392 --> 00:13:11,672
I went to Carl Harkness' nursing home yesterday to drum up some business.

207
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:15,230
The last thing those people care about is how they look.

208
00:13:18,897 --> 00:13:20,181
What are we gonna do?

209
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,569
How's your savings?

210
00:13:21,682 --> 00:13:23,526
Savings? What savings?

211
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:26,193
What about you?

212
00:13:26,264 --> 00:13:28,764
It's all in here or the house, just like you.

213
00:13:28,988 --> 00:13:32,003
And I won't touch Matt and Annie's education funds.

214
00:13:32,142 --> 00:13:35,500
Other than that, there's not much left.

215
00:13:36,802 --> 00:13:38,317
Hey, can I come in?

216
00:13:38,373 --> 00:13:39,668
Yeah, sure.

217
00:13:44,671 --> 00:13:47,626
It's pretty obvious that we're struggling right now,

218
00:13:47,933 --> 00:13:50,827
and, well, um...

219
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:53,402
I want to do my part to help.

220
00:13:53,816 --> 00:13:56,304
Don't tell me. You're finally gonna get that nose job.

221
00:13:56,781 --> 00:13:58,205
Not exactly.

222
00:13:59,083 --> 00:14:01,307
I'm going to resign.

223
00:14:06,386 --> 00:14:08,746
- Liz, you don't have to do this.
- Yeah, I do.

224
00:14:08,823 --> 00:14:11,527
Everyone knows that you guys have been dipping into your pockets

225
00:14:11,573 --> 00:14:14,389
to keep us all employed, and you shouldn't have to.

226
00:14:14,809 --> 00:14:19,677
So... I will still be available for surgeries,

227
00:14:19,738 --> 00:14:24,358
but other than that, I will be out of my office by the end of the week.

228
00:14:37,485 --> 00:14:39,798
It's only temporarily, I promise.

229
00:14:41,749 --> 00:14:43,815
You're welcome back whenever you want.

230
00:14:44,197 --> 00:14:45,123
Thanks.

231
00:14:45,318 --> 00:14:47,381
9 years we've all been together.

232
00:14:48,958 --> 00:14:49,773
Hey...

233
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,702
what will we do without you?

234
00:14:53,311 --> 00:14:54,238
Yeah.

235
00:14:57,492 --> 00:14:59,689
I'm gonna miss you guys, too.

236
00:15:01,001 --> 00:15:04,749
How about one last insult for old times' sake, huh?

237
00:15:05,061 --> 00:15:06,777
I'll call you when I come up with one.

238
00:15:06,869 --> 00:15:07,759
Ok.

239
00:15:08,405 --> 00:15:09,778
I can't wait.

240
00:15:29,819 --> 00:15:31,710
I'm calling Glenn Easley.

241
00:15:32,346 --> 00:15:34,091
If it's still available,

242
00:15:34,349 --> 00:15:36,714
we need to take the job at the mortuary.

243
00:16:01,909 --> 00:16:06,363
The hotel De La Mer was Miami's most exclusive spot in the twenties.

244
00:16:16,842 --> 00:16:18,447
Is that urine?

245
00:16:19,410 --> 00:16:21,252
I wouldn't touch anything.

246
00:16:25,128 --> 00:16:27,826
What happened to this place?

247
00:16:28,625 --> 00:16:30,228
Well, it only has 16 rooms.

248
00:16:30,235 --> 00:16:33,371
I guess it couldn't keep up with the big resorts that were being built.

249
00:16:33,837 --> 00:16:38,454
I read it was a boarding house for retards till they lost funding and closed down.

250
00:16:38,511 --> 00:16:42,414
Now it's just hookers and crackheads who call it home.

251
00:16:42,926 --> 00:16:45,168
This place is stunning.

252
00:16:45,435 --> 00:16:48,154
I can't believe nobody's rehabbed it.

253
00:16:54,385 --> 00:16:57,046
It would make a killer boutique hotel, right?

254
00:16:57,211 --> 00:17:00,513
You know, one of those fancy, minimalist places where you barely have a stool to sit on

255
00:17:00,548 --> 00:17:02,736
while you drink your $8.00 bottled water?

256
00:17:02,812 --> 00:17:06,892
Yeah. Somebody could make a lot of money.

257
00:17:07,230 --> 00:17:10,344
Well, why not me?

258
00:17:11,368 --> 00:17:13,488
It's not easy running a hotel.

259
00:17:13,538 --> 00:17:15,859
Who said run it? I'm just gonna buy it, throw up some walls,

260
00:17:15,914 --> 00:17:18,859
splash some paint on it and sell it for twice what I paid.

261
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:20,624
Do you have that kind of money?

262
00:17:20,702 --> 00:17:23,133
I know the guy who's handling the foreclosure auction.

263
00:17:23,230 --> 00:17:27,382
He said for the right price, I can buy it before anyone else has the chance.

264
00:17:27,464 --> 00:17:29,201
The bank will take care of the loan.

265
00:17:29,314 --> 00:17:32,309
I just need to come up with the 5% down payment.

266
00:17:34,730 --> 00:17:35,821
So?

267
00:17:36,829 --> 00:17:38,185
What do you think?

268
00:17:42,236 --> 00:17:44,228
You're asking me for the money?

269
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:46,419
I'm only looking for $40,000.

270
00:17:46,496 --> 00:17:48,969
You'll get it back in 6 months with interest.

271
00:17:49,026 --> 00:17:50,987
It is a good investment, Julia.

272
00:17:51,243 --> 00:17:54,959
I have to hand it to you, Gina. I did not see this coming.

273
00:17:55,011 --> 00:17:59,081
Hey, when I came to your apartment today, it was because I respect you. That's the truth.

274
00:17:59,143 --> 00:18:03,043
This loan, I just-- I think it could benefit both of us, that's all.

275
00:18:03,695 --> 00:18:06,085
And if I don't give you the money?

276
00:18:06,331 --> 00:18:10,684
One thing I've learned about myself, I can be very resourceful.

277
00:18:23,585 --> 00:18:26,846
Well, you deserve the credit for finding this place,

278
00:18:26,913 --> 00:18:29,403
but without my money, you have nothing.

279
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:32,879
So I have a proposal for you.

280
00:18:33,770 --> 00:18:36,565
I'll be your partner, 50-50,

281
00:18:36,876 --> 00:18:42,606
but instead of flipping it, we'll transform it into a surgical recovery spa.

282
00:18:44,203 --> 00:18:45,648
A spa?

283
00:18:46,917 --> 00:18:48,781
Where the hell did that idea come from?

284
00:18:48,931 --> 00:18:53,943
You know, I've been thinking about it for a while, ever since Matt had his operation.

285
00:18:54,102 --> 00:18:56,098
They wanted him out of there as soon as possible

286
00:18:56,154 --> 00:18:58,571
so they could use his bed for someone else.

287
00:18:58,606 --> 00:19:01,812
Patients should get better care than that, don't you think?

288
00:19:04,316 --> 00:19:06,587
I don't know anything about running a place like that.

289
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:08,545
Well, you leave that up to me.

290
00:19:08,610 --> 00:19:12,349
Now, what you're good at is getting people to do things for you,

291
00:19:12,390 --> 00:19:16,266
and I know what a huge asset that can be.

292
00:19:21,950 --> 00:19:25,711
So tell me a little more about this recovery spa idea.

293
00:19:25,806 --> 00:19:29,106
Let me introduce De La Mer, an exclusive oasis

294
00:19:29,158 --> 00:19:32,307
where recovering surgical patients can recuperate in style

295
00:19:32,357 --> 00:19:35,948
while they embark on a journey of personal renewal.

296
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:39,106
With all the amenities of a 5-star resort, including

297
00:19:39,167 --> 00:19:43,387
skin care, massage, water treatments, and full-body wellness,

298
00:19:43,449 --> 00:19:46,678
De La Mer offers guests the opportunity to refresh

299
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:50,667
their minds, spirits, and souls while their bodies heal.

300
00:19:50,729 --> 00:19:53,386
De La Mer will cater to a clientele that often recuperates

301
00:19:53,448 --> 00:19:56,334
from surgical procedures in the Caribbean or Europe.

302
00:19:56,402 --> 00:19:58,552
What we will provide is an alternative.

303
00:19:58,618 --> 00:20:02,280
We will package hospital stays and recovery vacations together.

304
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:04,220
One-stop shopping if you will.

305
00:20:04,307 --> 00:20:08,101
After arrival, our guests will check into the spa before their procedure,

306
00:20:08,163 --> 00:20:10,789
perhaps enjoying a gourmet meal from our kitchen,

307
00:20:10,851 --> 00:20:15,084
a bath or a swim in the pool to relax and get comfortable.

308
00:20:15,167 --> 00:20:17,696
When the time comes, we will deliver them to your offices

309
00:20:17,752 --> 00:20:21,371
for any pre-op appointments and the surgery itself.

310
00:20:21,459 --> 00:20:24,551
Even with only 50% occupancy,

311
00:20:24,628 --> 00:20:27,050
De La Mer has set up a revenue structure

312
00:20:27,112 --> 00:20:30,705
that will reach a profit by the end of fiscal year 3.

313
00:20:30,773 --> 00:20:33,814
Surgical vacations is a growth industry, gentlemen,

314
00:20:33,896 --> 00:20:36,364
and packaging your services and ours

315
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:41,540
will ensure that McNamara/Troy stays at the leading edge of quality patient care.

316
00:20:47,326 --> 00:20:50,726
Well, you guys have put a lot of work into this.

317
00:20:53,789 --> 00:20:57,193
I just don't see what you bring to the business, Gina.

318
00:20:57,259 --> 00:20:59,542
Happy endings for anybody who jumps on the massage table?

319
00:20:59,613 --> 00:21:01,175
I found the place, asshole.

320
00:21:01,207 --> 00:21:04,888
Yes, and you swindled Julia into joining you in this suckhole.

321
00:21:04,923 --> 00:21:06,996
This is a solid proposal, Christian.

322
00:21:07,009 --> 00:21:10,766
Well, I, for one, think that we should find a way to get involved.

323
00:21:11,673 --> 00:21:14,574
Well, nobody asked your opinion, and you don't get a vote.

324
00:21:17,944 --> 00:21:22,213
Julia, you don't have experience with anything like this.

325
00:21:22,311 --> 00:21:23,924
It's a lot of hard work.

326
00:21:24,017 --> 00:21:27,538
And I hate to mention it, but you've dropped out of med school twice.

327
00:21:27,543 --> 00:21:32,541
To look after our young child so that you could pursue your dream of becoming a doctor.

328
00:21:32,613 --> 00:21:36,314
Well, this is my dream, Sean, and I am not about to let it pass me by.

329
00:21:36,397 --> 00:21:36,848
Julia.

330
00:21:36,899 --> 00:21:40,482
We know that McNamara/Troy is having problems bringing in patients right now,

331
00:21:40,554 --> 00:21:43,431
but sometimes to make money, you have to spend money.

332
00:21:45,423 --> 00:21:46,554
I'm sorry.

333
00:21:46,637 --> 00:21:48,766
We can't help you in your venture.

334
00:21:49,631 --> 00:21:51,526
I told you we shouldn't have come here, Julia.

335
00:21:51,586 --> 00:21:55,386
De La Mer is happening with or without your involvement, Sean.

336
00:21:55,458 --> 00:21:56,739
Let's go, Gina.

337
00:21:58,120 --> 00:21:59,846
Sean. Quentin.

338
00:22:01,135 --> 00:22:02,314
Scumbag.

339
00:23:38,928 --> 00:23:42,846
Looks like Frankengina Vagenstein's been holding out on us.

340
00:23:44,018 --> 00:23:45,170
What is that?

341
00:23:45,381 --> 00:23:46,367
A sex toy?

342
00:23:46,445 --> 00:23:48,268
Well, it's not a thai spring roll.

343
00:23:48,585 --> 00:23:50,219
What? You're surprised?

344
00:23:50,449 --> 00:23:53,781
I just thought he was practicing his surgical technique.

345
00:23:56,757 --> 00:23:58,764
Why doesn't this haunt you?

346
00:23:59,046 --> 00:24:00,269
Because they're dead.

347
00:24:00,346 --> 00:24:01,713
They don't feel anything.

348
00:24:01,812 --> 00:24:06,347
Look, it's a terrible, horrible thing that this sicko did, but this is just rotting flesh.

349
00:24:06,399 --> 00:24:07,684
They're not people anymore.

350
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:11,923
And if they ever had a soul or a spirit or whatever that is, it's not here.

351
00:24:11,984 --> 00:24:13,100
They're gone.

352
00:24:14,754 --> 00:24:16,966
I'm sorry, but I see people here.

353
00:24:17,217 --> 00:24:21,875
They lived their lives and they died too young, and they deserve respect and dignity.

354
00:24:24,548 --> 00:24:27,825
Sorry to interrupt your work, but the police have had a breakthrough on Prine.

355
00:24:27,887 --> 00:24:30,944
He heard that some plastic surgeons were dismantling his work,

356
00:24:30,999 --> 00:24:34,245
and he feels you're kindred spirits.

357
00:24:34,322 --> 00:24:38,648
He'll only reveal the identity of the head to one of you.

358
00:26:22,169 --> 00:26:24,921
I just got off the phone with Sunset Marble and Tile.

359
00:26:24,962 --> 00:26:27,681
I think I'm gonna get us the travertine at cost.

360
00:26:27,747 --> 00:26:31,546
That's great. That'll save us almost $1,100.

361
00:26:31,558 --> 00:26:32,130
Yep.

362
00:26:32,196 --> 00:26:36,266
I've been very impressed by your negotiating skills, Gina.

363
00:26:36,483 --> 00:26:40,352
Well, you know, catch more bees with honey.

364
00:26:40,886 --> 00:26:43,507
I gotta run. I'm meeting the landscape architect, but

365
00:26:43,559 --> 00:26:45,867
I will be back for the concrete delivery at 3:00.

366
00:26:45,905 --> 00:26:46,564
Ok.

367
00:26:49,088 --> 00:26:54,987
Yeah. I've got 30 yards of concrete for Gina Russo.

368
00:26:55,171 --> 00:26:59,558
Ok. Well, you're a little early, but I'll go get the contractor.

369
00:26:59,619 --> 00:27:02,584
My boss said I'd get paid first.

370
00:27:03,179 --> 00:27:04,678
I'll get my checkbook.

371
00:27:07,715 --> 00:27:11,134
I was also hoping for a hot lunch.

372
00:27:12,144 --> 00:27:13,684
A hot lunch?

373
00:27:13,750 --> 00:27:16,552
Yeah. All the guys at the plant wanted to make this delivery

374
00:27:16,603 --> 00:27:20,412
when they heard about the pretty lady who put in the order.

375
00:27:20,484 --> 00:27:22,137
I won the pool.

376
00:27:22,321 --> 00:27:25,803
I'm sorry, but the kitchen isn't finished yet.

377
00:27:27,662 --> 00:27:29,930
I'd be happy with a tossed salad.

378
00:27:30,099 --> 00:27:32,367
You know what? How about just the bill.

379
00:27:33,867 --> 00:27:34,865
Ok.

380
00:27:35,741 --> 00:27:38,230
But then I can't give you the promised discount.

381
00:27:40,154 --> 00:27:41,819
You know what? That's fine.

382
00:27:46,357 --> 00:27:47,600
You can put it around back.

383
00:28:08,427 --> 00:28:11,166
Thank you so much for coming, Dr. McNamara.

384
00:28:15,483 --> 00:28:17,868
Uh... please have a seat.

385
00:28:20,901 --> 00:28:25,443
I appreciate you coming. I'm sorry we couldn't have met under different circumstances.

386
00:28:25,493 --> 00:28:30,266
Did the warden give you any problems? 'Cause I find him to be quite moody.

387
00:28:30,332 --> 00:28:32,405
What is it that you want from me, Mr. Prine?

388
00:28:32,477 --> 00:28:34,539
No--please call me Silas.

389
00:28:35,539 --> 00:28:36,916
Perhaps I can call you Sean.

390
00:28:36,968 --> 00:28:39,343
No. I prefer Dr. McNamara.

391
00:28:40,710 --> 00:28:43,188
You have earned that title, haven't you?

392
00:28:44,621 --> 00:28:45,799
I didn't come here to chat.

393
00:28:45,856 --> 00:28:47,499
Oh, yes, you did, Dr. McNamara.

394
00:28:47,539 --> 00:28:52,319
If you want any information out of me at all, you have to chat with me for quite some time.

395
00:28:52,972 --> 00:28:54,591
These are my rules.

396
00:29:01,134 --> 00:29:03,423
You know, I have to say, I was very impressed to hear

397
00:29:03,463 --> 00:29:09,900
that such an esteemed plastic surgeon would be the one disassembling my handiwork.

398
00:29:09,922 --> 00:29:14,933
I-- may I ask your professional opinion? What did you, uh--

399
00:29:15,353 --> 00:29:17,068
what did you think of her?

400
00:29:17,933 --> 00:29:20,406
I found the work to be quite crude.

401
00:29:23,094 --> 00:29:23,985
Yes.

402
00:29:24,338 --> 00:29:25,997
Um... ahem!

403
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:31,695
I'm gonna have to agree. I had only the most rudimentary tools at my disposal.

404
00:29:32,299 --> 00:29:34,343
You're a very sick man.

405
00:29:35,161 --> 00:29:36,534
You need help.

406
00:29:37,383 --> 00:29:38,351
I suppose.

407
00:29:39,269 --> 00:29:41,756
Maybe you could be the one who can give it to me.

408
00:29:42,074 --> 00:29:43,661
There's not much I can do.

409
00:29:43,727 --> 00:29:46,600
You'd think so, wouldn't you? But, you know, the fact is that, um,

410
00:29:46,702 --> 00:29:49,400
I'll be free in about 5 or 10 years.

411
00:29:49,456 --> 00:29:52,738
I'm not--I didn't kill anybody

412
00:29:52,964 --> 00:29:57,563
and I'm only 38, so I've got a lot of life ahead of me.

413
00:29:59,273 --> 00:30:02,943
So then, how can I help you?

414
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:14,269
I want you to save her head.

415
00:30:16,086 --> 00:30:17,356
She, um...

416
00:30:18,457 --> 00:30:20,505
she's very special to me...

417
00:30:22,210 --> 00:30:25,922
and I want to be with her when I'm released.

418
00:30:26,756 --> 00:30:28,262
She, um...

419
00:30:29,378 --> 00:30:31,718
she wanted to be cremated.

420
00:30:32,860 --> 00:30:37,451
I just can't let that happen. I mean, it's just an awful thing to do to people, cremate them.

421
00:30:38,011 --> 00:30:41,240
I mean, I should know. I've seen half-melted bodies

422
00:30:41,298 --> 00:30:44,227
that need to be repositioned in order to fully burn,

423
00:30:44,287 --> 00:30:49,121
their skin scorched off, their abdomens distended like balloons.

424
00:30:49,575 --> 00:30:52,382
Her head is decomposing.

425
00:30:52,469 --> 00:30:55,407
In 5 to 10 years, it'll be nothing but a brittle skull.

426
00:30:55,434 --> 00:30:57,328
Haven't you heard of cryonics?

427
00:30:57,414 --> 00:30:59,452
It's too late for her.

428
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:02,771
Cryonics requires that the body be frozen right after death.

429
00:31:02,822 --> 00:31:04,215
Science can't save her.

430
00:31:04,277 --> 00:31:05,746
Yeah? What if you're wrong?

431
00:31:06,104 --> 00:31:09,948
What if medicine does advance to the extent that she could be returned to me?

432
00:31:09,989 --> 00:31:11,608
I mean, what have I got to lose?

433
00:31:23,932 --> 00:31:25,273
I love her.

434
00:31:29,272 --> 00:31:31,459
She is all I have...

435
00:31:32,843 --> 00:31:38,165
and I will do everything possible to try to save her.

436
00:31:40,162 --> 00:31:41,571
And--and...

437
00:31:42,635 --> 00:31:46,204
who are you to try and stop me?

438
00:31:46,276 --> 00:31:48,052
I mean, really, Dr. McNamara?

439
00:31:48,103 --> 00:31:50,387
Isn't what you do pretty much the same thing?

440
00:31:50,443 --> 00:31:55,983
I mean, isn't plastic surgery just giving people the opportunity to put off their decay?

441
00:31:56,066 --> 00:31:59,566
I think what I do is make people feel better about themselves.

442
00:32:02,650 --> 00:32:08,337
Ok. Then just think of her as another patient.

443
00:32:09,387 --> 00:32:13,247
She wants to feel better about herself, too...

444
00:32:13,776 --> 00:32:15,522
by living again.

445
00:32:23,283 --> 00:32:25,412
If I agree to do this,

446
00:32:26,339 --> 00:32:28,506
will you tell me who she is?

447
00:32:36,514 --> 00:32:37,834
Of course.

448
00:32:53,134 --> 00:32:54,982
Her name is Laura...

449
00:32:56,998 --> 00:32:59,866
and she's my sister.

450
00:33:05,923 --> 00:33:08,273
Yeah. Right.

451
00:33:08,708 --> 00:33:10,111
I'll see you later.

452
00:33:14,955 --> 00:33:17,075
I need to speak with you, Gina.

453
00:33:18,072 --> 00:33:19,634
I'll see you later, Carlito.

454
00:33:23,270 --> 00:33:24,959
I know what's going on, Gina.

455
00:33:25,026 --> 00:33:28,396
This is a business, and bartering with sexual favors

456
00:33:28,467 --> 00:33:33,376
is unprofessional, illegal, and with your hiv, extremely dangerous.

457
00:33:33,422 --> 00:33:36,162
I have not endangered anyone's life, I haven't slept with anyone,

458
00:33:36,219 --> 00:33:38,072
and I've been very careful to protect myself.

459
00:33:38,129 --> 00:33:40,770
It's still not a way to run a company!

460
00:33:40,894 --> 00:33:43,929
I have worked too hard to be undermined like this.

461
00:33:43,991 --> 00:33:45,593
Julia, I didn't tell you about this because I--

462
00:33:45,654 --> 00:33:48,384
You didn't tell me about this because you knew I wouldn't agree with it!

463
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:50,938
Oh, but you agree with the money I've been saving, right?

464
00:33:51,363 --> 00:33:54,266
When people give you discounts, they expect something in return.

465
00:33:54,317 --> 00:33:56,647
You're still not getting it, Gina.

466
00:33:56,735 --> 00:33:59,649
It is difficult enough being a woman in the professional world.

467
00:33:59,699 --> 00:34:02,741
What you're doing makes it even harder. It cheapens us.

468
00:34:02,808 --> 00:34:06,667
You told me that I was good at convincing people to do things. That's what I'm doing!

469
00:34:06,825 --> 00:34:09,355
But you're better than this, Gina.

470
00:34:09,708 --> 00:34:12,488
Now, I wanted you as a partner because you're ambitious,

471
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:15,852
because you can stand up for yourself, because you're smart!

472
00:34:15,929 --> 00:34:18,601
Not because you can get a man to sleep with you.

473
00:34:19,432 --> 00:34:20,619
Now, look.

474
00:34:21,019 --> 00:34:24,413
We both want to do what it takes to be successful,

475
00:34:24,475 --> 00:34:28,697
and I just want to make sure that when we get there, there aren't any raised eyebrows.

476
00:34:28,847 --> 00:34:32,831
I don't want anyone to be able to say that we don't deserve it.

477
00:34:39,226 --> 00:34:41,494
I'll go see how the electrician's doing.

478
00:34:49,748 --> 00:34:51,326
- Hi.
- Hey.

479
00:34:51,441 --> 00:34:55,153
A package for you came to the house. I thought I'd bring it by, see how it's going.

480
00:34:56,546 --> 00:34:59,348
Looks like things are moving full steam ahead.

481
00:34:59,435 --> 00:35:01,672
Yeah. We're right on schedule.

482
00:35:02,794 --> 00:35:06,653
I have to say, Jules, I'm impressed.

483
00:35:07,068 --> 00:35:08,871
You're really making this happen.

484
00:35:10,379 --> 00:35:12,015
Congratulations.

485
00:35:12,357 --> 00:35:16,166
Yeah. Well, thanks for bringing this by, but if you don't mind, I have work to do.

486
00:35:16,243 --> 00:35:19,725
I was actually hoping we could talk.

487
00:35:22,316 --> 00:35:25,731
I wanted to apologize for how we treated you the other day.

488
00:35:27,313 --> 00:35:30,606
We've really taken a hit since these carver accusations,

489
00:35:30,667 --> 00:35:34,040
and after the divorce settlement,

490
00:35:34,133 --> 00:35:37,487
there just isn't enough money to invest in your spa.

491
00:35:37,768 --> 00:35:40,892
I should have told you about my situation earlier, I know.

492
00:35:42,084 --> 00:35:44,045
I haven't handled this well.

493
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:48,269
I just wanted you to know I'm still on your side.

494
00:35:49,713 --> 00:35:53,748
Well, that's funny, because you and Christian couldn't have made it more clear

495
00:35:53,799 --> 00:35:55,738
that you didn't believe in me.

496
00:35:57,622 --> 00:35:59,815
Look, the truth is, Sean,

497
00:36:00,281 --> 00:36:07,369
I am tired of destroying and resuscitating our relationship over and over again.

498
00:36:07,690 --> 00:36:10,937
I don't need you on my side anymore.

499
00:36:11,336 --> 00:36:14,484
All you are to me anymore is a parent to Matt and Annie.

500
00:36:14,501 --> 00:36:15,678
Nothing else.

501
00:36:45,828 --> 00:36:48,158
Liz, where you going?

502
00:36:48,537 --> 00:36:51,215
Didn't Christian tell you? We took the job at the mortuary.

503
00:36:51,383 --> 00:36:53,431
We don't have to worry about money for at least 3 months.

504
00:36:53,524 --> 00:36:54,917
I did tell her, Sean.

505
00:36:55,004 --> 00:36:56,894
Apparently, it's too late.

506
00:36:57,441 --> 00:37:00,788
I'm sorry, Sean, but I have taken another job.

507
00:37:01,409 --> 00:37:02,475
Where?

508
00:37:04,712 --> 00:37:06,165
Julia's spa.

509
00:37:06,959 --> 00:37:10,036
Why do they need an anesthesiologist at a recovery spa?

510
00:37:10,108 --> 00:37:13,079
I'm more than just an anesthesiologist, Sean.

511
00:37:13,104 --> 00:37:15,480
Julia hired me to be their general practitioner.

512
00:37:15,546 --> 00:37:17,767
What if it doesn't work out? What if they run out of money?

513
00:37:17,834 --> 00:37:20,215
You expect us just to take you in again?

514
00:37:20,804 --> 00:37:24,798
I believe in Julia, Sean. She is very smart.

515
00:37:24,874 --> 00:37:28,633
I think De La Mer has the potential to really help people.

516
00:37:28,699 --> 00:37:30,777
You don't think we're helping people?

517
00:37:32,464 --> 00:37:37,306
I guess I am just tired of putting them to sleep.

518
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:56,163
Tell me what you don't like about yourself, Mrs. Ogilvie?

519
00:37:56,265 --> 00:37:59,967
Well, after seeing Dr. McNamara's presentation,

520
00:38:00,038 --> 00:38:06,854
I thought it would be really nice to regain some of that hop in my step.

521
00:38:06,941 --> 00:38:09,163
And what exactly do you have in mind?

522
00:38:09,813 --> 00:38:12,091
I think I want a face lift.

523
00:38:12,398 --> 00:38:15,086
Great. You'll feel 25 years younger.

524
00:38:15,143 --> 00:38:20,824
Not 25. I don't want my daughter thinking I'm competing with her. Ha ha ha.

525
00:38:21,507 --> 00:38:24,251
Never feel guilty for being beautiful, Mrs. Ogilvie.

526
00:38:25,523 --> 00:38:28,768
And while you're here, why don't we work on a few other things?

527
00:38:28,829 --> 00:38:32,690
Perhaps remove the bags under your eyes, flatten your tummy a little?

528
00:38:32,745 --> 00:38:37,727
Well, Dr. McNamara did say that the second operation would be half-price.

529
00:38:37,755 --> 00:38:41,589
That's right. So, I think we have an opening coming up--

530
00:38:41,671 --> 00:38:45,725
Mrs. Ogilvie, let's take a step back and think clearly for a moment.

531
00:38:45,802 --> 00:38:49,350
For someone your age, these operations can be very dangerous.

532
00:38:49,407 --> 00:38:52,325
But you said more senior citizens were having plastic surgery.

533
00:38:52,361 --> 00:38:55,950
You're right, I did. And I should not have encouraged you.

534
00:38:56,641 --> 00:38:59,058
I'm afraid you're wasting your time.

535
00:38:59,446 --> 00:39:01,606
You're old, Mrs. Ogilvie.

536
00:39:01,710 --> 00:39:03,609
Your skin has very little elasticity.

537
00:39:03,691 --> 00:39:08,227
A face lift will pull it so tight, you'd have difficulty smiling, frowning, raising your eyebrows.

538
00:39:08,330 --> 00:39:10,829
It would mask the real you.

539
00:39:10,916 --> 00:39:14,816
You'll be fine. We'll take very good care of you here, I promise.

540
00:39:16,188 --> 00:39:21,601
Well, I think I want the operations later today.

541
00:39:21,688 --> 00:39:22,753
Great.

542
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,198
15 blade.

543
00:39:49,804 --> 00:39:51,087
Scissors.

544
00:39:57,933 --> 00:39:59,064
Shit, it's ripping.

545
00:39:59,106 --> 00:40:01,973
It's all right. It'll be excess when we pull the dermis tight.

546
00:40:02,301 --> 00:40:03,790
I'll have to go a little deeper.

547
00:40:12,499 --> 00:40:13,082
Be careful.

548
00:40:13,129 --> 00:40:16,271
I can't go any deeper. It's too delicate. I don't think this is gonna work.

549
00:40:16,324 --> 00:40:18,668
If we have to, we can grab some skin from her thigh.

550
00:40:18,726 --> 00:40:23,175
Her entire face is gonna be like this. The skin is just too thin. She's too old.

551
00:40:42,156 --> 00:40:43,664
What are you doing?

552
00:40:47,003 --> 00:40:49,462
I'm sorry, Christian. I can't do this anymore.

553
00:40:50,203 --> 00:40:52,518
It's all right. I'll finish up, and we can talk about it tomorrow.

554
00:40:52,529 --> 00:40:54,320
There's not gonna be a tomorrow for us!

555
00:40:54,386 --> 00:40:58,626
Quentin is an excellent surgeon. I'm sure you two will get along just fine.

556
00:40:58,698 --> 00:41:00,274
What's that supposed to mean?

557
00:41:00,346 --> 00:41:02,348
You can't just quit. We have a goddamn patient on the table!

558
00:41:02,404 --> 00:41:05,369
I saw Silas Prine today. The head belongs to his sister.

559
00:41:05,431 --> 00:41:07,832
He was screwing his sister.

560
00:41:15,844 --> 00:41:16,961
Jesus.

561
00:41:17,304 --> 00:41:18,671
Her name was Laura.

562
00:41:18,908 --> 00:41:21,376
She died in a car accident 4 years ago.

563
00:41:22,608 --> 00:41:24,933
Prine buried the body in the woods by his house,

564
00:41:24,978 --> 00:41:28,307
but not before he decapitated her first and kept the head for himself.

565
00:41:30,493 --> 00:41:32,459
Did you tell the police who she was?

566
00:41:35,454 --> 00:41:37,216
They found her body this afternoon,

567
00:41:38,858 --> 00:41:44,092
but to get her identity, I had to tell Prine I'd keep her head safe until he was released...

568
00:41:45,622 --> 00:41:47,794
so he could be with her again.

569
00:41:52,407 --> 00:41:53,979
He said I was like him.

570
00:41:56,922 --> 00:41:58,243
He wasn't wrong.

571
00:41:58,408 --> 00:42:01,065
Look at her. She's practically a corpse.

572
00:42:02,125 --> 00:42:04,526
We can't perform plastic surgery on her.

573
00:42:04,607 --> 00:42:07,158
She needs a feeding tube, not a face lift!

574
00:42:08,275 --> 00:42:09,538
Christian,

575
00:42:12,231 --> 00:42:15,426
I keep trying to put the pieces of my life together,

576
00:42:15,617 --> 00:42:20,280
to repair what's broken, Julia, Matt, this business.

577
00:42:23,256 --> 00:42:24,519
I can't.

578
00:42:26,250 --> 00:42:31,263
Everything I cared about at one time is dead.

579
00:42:31,407 --> 00:42:35,036
It's time I just stopped fighting the inevitable, let it all rot.

580
00:42:40,902 --> 00:42:42,405
What are you gonna do?

581
00:42:44,657 --> 00:42:47,360
For the first time in my life, I don't know.

582
00:45:23,620 --> 00:45:27,821
