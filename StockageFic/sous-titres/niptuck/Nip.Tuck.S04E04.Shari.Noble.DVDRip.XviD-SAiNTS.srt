1
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:02,189
Previously on Nip / Tuck...

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:04,748
You turned an innocent encounter
I had with an old friend

3
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:06,671
into a lurid, sexual tryst.

4
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:07,954
I know what I saw.

5
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:11,271
We should just
hop into the empty bed right here.

6
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:12,679
Before he wakes up.

7
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:17,276
Barring anything unforeseen, I think that
we'd love to have you working with us.

8
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:20,194
I just got off the phone
with Monica Wilder.

9
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:21,474
She's passing on the job.

10
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:24,233
Most couples have a hard time
with a male nurse.

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,069
We've got to talk.

12
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:42,195
I think you pretty much made your point

13
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:43,395
when I was late for Conor's birth.

14
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:46,438
I'm a shallow, insensitive dickwad,
and a disappointment as a friend.

15
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:48,670
- Christian...
- And you're probably right.

16
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:52,548
But this is called the break room.
As in, I need one.

17
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:59,355
I want to apologize for being a
self-righteous hypocrite.

18
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:03,350
You were right about the night nurse.

19
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:11,076
I screwed her and I gave her a gratis nose
job so she wouldn't say anything to Julia.

20
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:17,714
After Megan, I swore I'd never cheat again.

21
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:21,438
And now I've done just that
with someone I don't even like.

22
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:25,837
Don't be so hard on yourself.

23
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,559
Julia's been closed
for repairs lately, right?

24
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:31,393
It was a one time thing,
cut yourself some slack.

25
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,399
- Just don't do it again.
- I want to do it again.

26
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:36,634
Badly.

27
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,316
- What's her name?
- Monica.

28
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:45,469
Monica.

29
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:51,790
Gone. The little slut's history.
Easy as popping a zit, huh?

30
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,237
The thing is, Sean, some men can't
handle temptation.

31
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:58,873
And some men can.

32
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:13,433
- You know, it's just how I pictured it.
- I assume that's a compliment.

33
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:21,477
Before I forget, I have a table at
the Philharmonic fundraiser on Saturday.

34
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,754
- Burt's not feeling up to it so...
- Well, maybe you should try prune juice.

35
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,308
...I thought you might want to go with me.

36
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:31,231
I'll have my tux pressed.

37
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,354
Two settings?

38
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:46,352
I was under the impression
Sean would be joining us.

39
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:48,988
Wasn't this supposed to be
our bury-the-hatchet dinner?

40
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:51,799
He sends his regrets.
Diaper rash or something.

41
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,354
Try some beluga.

42
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:06,637
Nice and buttery, not too salty.

43
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:13,952
You know, I don't think I ever told you.

44
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,519
I went to medical school.

45
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:23,279
I wanted to specialize
in reconstructive surgery.

46
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,198
But you never finished?

47
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:30,832
In my second year,
my mother was diagnosed with lymphoma

48
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:34,151
and I had to go back
and help with the family.

49
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,798
But I have no regrets.

50
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:40,074
I'm not exactly the surgeon
I dreamt of becoming,

51
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:44,517
but I do own one of the
top 10 plastic surgery practices in Miami.

52
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,874
I have big dreams for this business.

53
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:52,517
- Let's make the most of this association.
- Let's.

54
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,631
What are you doing, Christian?

55
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,270
I think Oscar Wilde said it best.

56
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:12,596
To get rid of temptation,
you need to give in to it.

57
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:22,712
Just so you know, sweetie-pie,
I'm not into S&M.

58
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,109
And I'm not into you.

59
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,671
Who do you think you're kidding?

60
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,951
You and I both know
you spent hours deliberating

61
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:34,192
which dress in your closet best displayed
that world-class cleavage of yours.

62
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:41,798
Since you love being
a businesswoman so much, Michelle,

63
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,791
let me give you the bottom line.

64
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:47,316
You either get real with me
and give in to what we're both feeling,

65
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,516
or sell me my business back.

66
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:53,878
Although my nurses might enjoy it,
I don't like doing surgery with a hard-on.

67
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:57,035
If you're uncomfortable
with the way I dress,

68
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,918
or in fact
anything at all about me, Christian,

69
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,798
then you're the one
who should consider leaving.

70
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:09,197
'Cause me and my world-class cleavage
ain't going nowhere.

71
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,955
It's the baby's position that's wrong.

72
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:18,308
Let's try the football position.
Just put him... All right.

73
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:22,118
All right, just right under you there.
Excellent.

74
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,789
Like that?

75
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,231
All right, sweetie, come on.

76
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,275
Come on.

77
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,071
I feel like I'm running for a touchdown.

78
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,230
Try to keep an open mind, honey.

79
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:38,070
Okay, on to plan B.

80
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:41,118
- Any beer in the fridge, Dr. McNamara?
- Beer?

81
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,998
Beer can be helpful
with lactation promotion.

82
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,275
It relaxes the mommy
so the milk can flow.

83
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:51,035
You know what, Mrs. Gunther?
I don't feel like a beer.

84
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:56,674
I think we'll take it from here.
So, thank you for your time.

85
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:00,039
If you continue to deny him the breast,
he will lose interest...

86
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:04,750
You know what? I have nursed two babies
and I don't need these irritating clichés.

87
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:08,474
I'm just going to pump my milk
and take a nap.

88
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,632
I wish you the best.

89
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:14,876
Thank you, Mrs. Gunther.

90
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,869
We need to think about
his surgeries, honey.

91
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,279
His first one's in three months

92
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:28,271
and breastfeeding helps him
gain the weight he needs

93
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:30,191
so his immune system will be strong.

94
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:33,716
The skin-on-skin contact also makes
him secure so he can handle the stress.

95
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:36,917
Yeah, but what about my stress, Sean?

96
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:41,110
You know, the milk won't flow.
You know, I've tried everything.

97
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:43,839
I know you judge me,
and you think I'm a bad mother...

98
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:48,277
I'm not judging you, Julia.
I'm just worried about Conor.

99
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:58,829
I think I have postpartum depression.

100
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:06,876
Maybe I should be on medication.

101
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:12,637
I kept telling the doctor in the ER,

102
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,154
it has got to look like nothing happened.

103
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:18,313
Finally, he just said to me,
"Lady, if you're that worried about it,

104
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,470
"you need to see a plastic surgeon. "

105
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:21,829
Do you mind?

106
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:31,515
Are you in pain, Mrs. Noble?
This looks quite brutal.

107
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:35,275
Oh, no, they gave me shots in the ER,
right here, where it happened.

108
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:38,477
- Your dog did this to you?
- His name is Rojo.

109
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:40,039
He's a pit bull mix.

110
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:44,316
But truly, it wasn't his fault,
he is an angel.

111
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:48,593
- An angel who left you without a nipple.
- Well, he didn't mean to attack me.

112
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:50,910
We were minding our own business
in the dog park

113
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,276
when this psycho chow just attacked him.

114
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:57,113
How did your nipple
find its way into a dogfight?

115
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:00,110
I was trying to separate them.

116
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:06,230
I was wearing a little tank t-shirt,
and his teeth just landed here.

117
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:09,273
You know, I...
It ripped right through the fabric.

118
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:15,877
I never should have tried to stop things.
I know that I used bad judgment.

119
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:21,909
The good news is you used
excellent judgment in coming to us.

120
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:25,711
We can give you subcutaneous sutures
and you won't ever see the stitches...

121
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:28,314
But I need it to look like
it never happened.

122
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:30,949
Okay.

123
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:36,071
My husband, Mark,
is coming back from Iraq in a week.

124
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:39,599
And he'll have the dog put down
if he finds out.

125
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:42,433
See, he already thinks that
Rojo's a problem dog.

126
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:46,993
Mark's away a lot
and Rojo is my protector.

127
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,676
He makes me feel safe.

128
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:53,672
I would lose my mind
if anything happened to him.

129
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,190
I mean, he was just doing his job.

130
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:10,957
I didn't see any papers of resignation
on my desk.

131
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,356
So I'll assume we're back on track?

132
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:18,469
Your chocolate cupcakes are
looking very tasty this morning, Michelle.

133
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,434
I get it.

134
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:27,877
If a straight man mentions sex,
it's not sexual harassment, it's foreplay.

135
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:33,392
By the way, Burt's feeling better.

136
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:36,438
He's determined to take me to the
fundraiser tonight.

137
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:39,154
Sorry,
but I'll have to rescind my invitation.

138
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,836
I know how you feel, Christian.

139
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,992
I've had some extremely
hot dreams about her myself.

140
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,475
Who?

141
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:05,956
Our lady of the low-cut camisole
and vanilla-grapefruit musk.

142
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:08,953
You know, there's a price to be paid
for living in a fog of oblivion, Liz.

143
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,109
Look at this poor lady.

144
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:13,590
She thought her doggie was a pussycat
and she lost her nipple.

145
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,911
What makes you think
you've got a shot with her?

146
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,197
Michelle is the kind of woman
who wants to feel like a spider

147
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:21,589
and I'm a helpless little fly
caught in her web.

148
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:26,836
Do you think you that could teach me
to be as full of shit as you are?

149
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:28,239
I thought lesbians didn't play games.

150
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:32,279
I thought it was all about cuddling
and sharing your depilatory cream.

151
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:34,316
Have you been to a lesbian bar lately?

152
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:37,233
There is more gaming going on
than a Vegas casino.

153
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:40,118
And the girls,
they're younger and they're hotter.

154
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:44,919
When was the last time
you went on a date, Liz?

155
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:47,988
A real one? Year and a half.

156
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:54,111
Hey, I have my rabbit vibrator.
Who needs a real, live girl, right?

157
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:00,274
Maybe you just need
to get yourself a coach.

158
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,070
What are you doing Saturday night?

159
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,708
Morning.

160
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:51,235
Don't you think that's a little inappropriate
for a baby's room?

161
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:55,438
Well, I'm not finished.

162
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:59,674
When I'm done
it will be filled with magic and color.

163
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:03,639
And if you don't like it,
I'll just paint over it.

164
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,836
- But you'll love it.
- I hope so.

165
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:12,394
Maybe it's my mood, but lately
everything seems to unnerve me.

166
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:15,196
Yeah,
you have seemed a little down lately.

167
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,472
I think I have postpartum.

168
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:22,438
I told Sean
I was considering taking medication.

169
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,951
He's against it, of course.

170
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:33,790
I'm just tired of letting people down.
I mean, especially Conor.

171
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:37,395
He'll be fine on formula,
millions of babies take it.

172
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:41,995
Julia, I've been around a lot of
mothers with postpartum.

173
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:46,638
And you don't seem like someone
whose hormones are running amok.

174
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,072
Can I make an observation?

175
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:57,830
Well, it just seems to me like
you feel responsible for all of it.

176
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:01,556
For Conor's condition,
everything he's gonna have to go through.

177
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:06,551
Who could sit and enjoy
the simple act of nursing their baby

178
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:08,995
with all that weight on their shoulders?

179
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:12,478
I mean, don't get me wrong,

180
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:15,876
if you feel like you need to go
on medication, you should.

181
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:18,310
That's fine, but...

182
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,274
But what?

183
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:27,869
I know this one little trick.
I think it might be worth trying.

184
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:38,950
Shh, sweetie.

185
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:45,549
- What's that?
- A warm washcloth.

186
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,917
I'm just gonna move this.

187
00:14:57,280 --> 00:15:01,831
It should relax the milk ducts.
Help with the let-down reflex.

188
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:25,952
What a crying shame.

189
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:30,349
All these magnificent vaginas
wasted on other vaginas.

190
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:31,874
Focus, Christian.

191
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:34,520
This is about finding me
the vagina of my dreams.

192
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:38,639
As if anyone here wants to go home
with a geriatric butterball.

193
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:42,350
Tip number one,
the self-deprecation's gotta go, okay?

194
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:47,188
What about her?

195
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:52,070
She's an eight.
Eights go home with eights or nines.

196
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,354
I'm a six.

197
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:03,591
Is she looking at me? She, over there?

198
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:08,149
She can't be looking at me. She's a 10.

199
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:13,108
No offense, sweetheart,
but I think she's looking at me.

200
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,231
Watch and learn, dizzy Lizzy.

201
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:27,990
Here's something to think about while
you're nibbling on that swizzle stick.

202
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:31,755
I can munch, dive, and go fish better
than any girl in this place.

203
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:34,753
Plus I have in my possession a very
lifelike dildo

204
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:36,956
just in case you start to get kinky.

205
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,514
What do you say?

206
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:44,840
First of all, I do the munching.

207
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,512
Second of all, you're an asshole.

208
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:59,194
Goddamn dykes have no sense of humor.

209
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:04,759
More alcohol's not gonna
make your number go up, Lizzy.

210
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:06,990
This is from your friend over there.

211
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:10,711
She says she wants to know
how soon you can dump the fairy.

212
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,152
You're so beautiful. You're a goddess.

213
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:47,594
Are you really here or did I dream you up?

214
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:49,873
You're the dream.

215
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:39,036
- Hello.
- Don't move.

216
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:41,039
You were shot full oflidocaine

217
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:44,317
so there shouldn't be any pain
before the paramedics arrive.

218
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,913
They're on their way.

219
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,312
What's the matter with me?

220
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:51,035
Your kidney's been surgically removed.

221
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:02,591
But don't worry, honey,
you only need one to live.

222
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:12,673
Dr. Da vis, telephone, please.
Dr. Da vis, telephone, please.

223
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,399
How is she?

224
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:17,677
I'm Dr. McNamara, this is Dr. Troy.
Dr. Cruz works for us.

225
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:20,953
Nice to meet you. Dr. Mira Mukhtar.
I'm a nephrologist.

226
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:24,077
- Please tell me she's gonna be okay.
- She's actually in very good shape.

227
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:27,948
Whoever these organ thieves are,
they do a clean, sterile nephrectomy.

228
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:31,713
Do we have any information
on who these people are?

229
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:35,315
There have been four of these thefts
in Miami since Christmas, all similar.

230
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:39,188
A decoy in a bar, a clean surgery
and a polite phone call afterwards.

231
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:42,431
The investigating officers think an
organized ring has moved into the area.

232
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:44,988
How much does a black market kidney
go for?

233
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:47,116
$200,000, maybe more.

234
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:49,551
That's if you go through
a new breed of broker.

235
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:52,154
They handle your flights
to Shanghai, Brazil,

236
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:55,118
and a half-dozen other countries
where crime flies under the radar.

237
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,156
- Can we see her?
- Yeah.

238
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:03,197
Dr. Bell, contact 2479.
Dr. Bell, contact 2479.

239
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:05,629
Hey.

240
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,958
My first pick up in a gay bar. Ow.

241
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:13,160
You think
God's trying to tell me something?

242
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:14,912
You're gonna be okay, Liz.

243
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:19,516
I'm fine. These meds are fantastic.

244
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:27,440
What is it about a beautiful woman?

245
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:30,593
I'm so sorry, Liz.

246
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:41,355
They told me I would be
out of commission for four to six weeks.

247
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,389
We'll get someone to cover for you,
that's not a problem.

248
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,550
Take all the time you need.

249
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,877
That's not the problem.

250
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:55,069
I don't have anyone to take care of me.

251
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:57,952
I don't have anyone.

252
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:09,552
You're wrong, Liz. You're not alone.

253
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:12,634
You'll always have us, Lizzy.

254
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:16,156
We're taking you back to McNamara/Troy
as soon as you pass gas.

255
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:20,557
Don't make me laugh.

256
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:31,751
Congratulations, darling.
You almost look respectable.

257
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,109
Who's this?

258
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:37,153
This is Analise.

259
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:40,752
Analise has been working for me,
for how long has it been?

260
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:42,159
Two years.

261
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:47,837
Analise has been sloppy.

262
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:51,189
I'm afraid she's compromised a client.

263
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:54,639
We need to make some changes,
don't we, Analise?

264
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,797
- Changes?
- Yes.

265
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:01,473
Specifically, a new nose
and chin for our girl here.

266
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:04,077
And it needs to happen today.

267
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:06,837
I don't owe you this.

268
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:10,230
I owe you one last payment
and then we are finished.

269
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:16,194
I don't think you realize
what a boon your new business is, pet.

270
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:18,033
For all of us.

271
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:23,232
What's good for me
is always the best for you.

272
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,473
You're fine with this?

273
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:30,111
She says frog, you jump?

274
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:36,760
James has always taken good care of me.

275
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:39,998
She knows what's best.

276
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,708
And what am I supposed to say
to the doctors?

277
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:52,076
They'll take one look at her
and say she doesn't need anything at all.

278
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:54,549
They will turn her down, I guarantee it.

279
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:58,753
Come here, darling.

280
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:02,471
Let's see if we at least have a case
for a chemical peel.

281
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:12,397
Does that solve your problem?

282
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:15,358
Put her on the books. Now.

283
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:27,998
Christian, she's been through a
terrible head-on collision, let her...

284
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:30,150
- Let her have it the way she wants it.
- I examined her.

285
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:31,639
Her features have classical proportions.

286
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:34,359
Why would somebody who looks like a
supermodel want to change her face?

287
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:36,670
Our job is not to judge, Christian.

288
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:41,231
I have the patient's request in writing.
Aquiline nose and enhanced chin.

289
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:42,955
Fine.

290
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:49,638
How long are the procedures?

291
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:51,836
Do you have time
to do them both by yourself?

292
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:55,071
- I might need some help.
- I'll pull Sean.

293
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:56,832
He's in a consult.

294
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:02,710
I'd like you to help me, Dr. Landau.

295
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:08,275
Linda, did I tell you that Michelle
went to medical school?

296
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,154
Scrub up, doc.

297
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:17,996
You know, if somebody
offered me my dream, I'd just say yes.

298
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:34,476
Would you like to make the first cut,
doctor? I'll be right behind you.

299
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,115
15-blade.

300
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:51,679
15-blade.

301
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:32,276
A month's severance.
I think that's perfectly fair.

302
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:34,508
More than fair.

303
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:37,793
But I'm also entitled
to a reasonable explanation.

304
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:39,791
You crossed the line, Marlowe.

305
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:42,272
You fondled my wife's breast.

306
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:45,875
It was right in front of you
and you couldn't resist touching it.

307
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:48,191
I said reasonable explanation.

308
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:51,469
I was trying to help her milk let down.

309
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:53,758
Listen, I get it.

310
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:56,833
You're working around vulnerable women
in a state of semi-undress,

311
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:58,558
it's got to be tempting.

312
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:02,276
Especially when you might have
some frustrations in that area.

313
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:05,558
Meaning that
I have problems attracting women,

314
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:07,710
therefore in my sex-starved state

315
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:10,758
I couldn't help
but cop a feel of your wife's breast.

316
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:16,599
Too bad, I liked this job.

317
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:21,796
And strangely enough, I thought
you and I were on the same page.

318
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:23,359
About what?

319
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:26,876
About keeping Julia off of antidepressants
so she can nurse Conor.

320
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,552
He needs that from her.

321
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:31,757
But you know what?
He's not my kid, he's yours.

322
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,877
And about me and the ladies?

323
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:40,229
Between Gilda,
she's a dancer with the Miami Ballet,

324
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:44,230
and Rosie, a buyer for Saks, I get more...

325
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:49,479
- Send Julia my regrets.
- Wait a minute.

326
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:55,553
So in your opinion, what are the chances
we can keep her off the medication?

327
00:26:56,600 --> 00:27:00,752
Personally, I think the pills
are just an excuse not to breast-feed.

328
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:04,988
When she nurses, his little hands
on her skin make her anxious.

329
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:06,718
I've seen it firsthand.

330
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:09,758
So, what's your solution
if you don't mind my asking?

331
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:13,153
She needs the space to express herself.

332
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:16,314
Encouragement, not absolutes.

333
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:20,994
Anything more
and you're gonna have to pay me.

334
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:29,472
Hi. Is this a bad time?

335
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:43,031
It's all clear up there, Monica.

336
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:45,756
I'm not sure
why you're having trouble breathing.

337
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:48,229
- It isn't swollen?
- Nope.

338
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:56,233
Would you hate me if I told you
I wasn't really having trouble breathing?

339
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:04,914
What I'm having trouble with
is getting you out of my mind.

340
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:11,519
- How you touched me...
- Monica, I'm not gonna be with you again.

341
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:14,839
I'm married. We both made a mistake.

342
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:20,397
People say that eyes are the windows
to a person's soul.

343
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,239
I say it's the hands.

344
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:29,355
I love your hands.
They're so sensitive and confident.

345
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:34,719
Come see me tonight.

346
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:37,674
You know where I live,
you dropped me off.

347
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:41,275
You need to forget about me, Monica.

348
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:47,430
I can't. I tried, I can't.

349
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:02,918
I'll be at home tonight.

350
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:06,310
Thinking of your hands on me.

351
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:23,631
When will I get my sensation back?

352
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:26,280
It should come back
over the next few months.

353
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:29,955
Mark.

354
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:33,029
Hello, Shari.

355
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,719
- What are you... I thought...
- You thought what?

356
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:40,473
Excuse me,
but we're in the middle of an exam.

357
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:42,232
You'll have to take a seat
in the waiting room.

358
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:44,675
Well, you said you weren't coming back
until the 30th.

359
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:49,629
So you booked a little plastic surgery
to make yourself look all pretty for me?

360
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,275
- How'd you know?
- You weren't home.

361
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:57,310
- I called your sister.
- I'm sorry I didn't clean the house.

362
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:58,674
Guess what I saw?

363
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:02,036
Sir, the homecoming's gonna have to
wait until your wife is discharged.

364
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:05,715
Did Rojo poop inside?
I asked my sister to walk him.

365
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:10,828
I saw an open peanut butter jar
by the goddamn bed, Shari.

366
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:18,118
I thought we agreed
this wasn't gonna happen again.

367
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:23,839
I told you I didn't clean up, I didn't
know that you were coming back.

368
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:28,789
So now you just keep it there by the bed?
Case the spirit moves you?

369
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:32,271
How often? Every night?

370
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:36,271
Sergeant, if your wife's
peanut butter addiction is a problem,

371
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:37,793
you'll have to deal with this at home.

372
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:39,632
I'll be done in 60 seconds.

373
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:49,273
You know, on our very first date, Shari,

374
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:53,078
as you sat there, chattering away,

375
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:59,555
my mind ran through all the things about
you that could become a problem for me.

376
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:04,040
As you know, I like to anticipate.

377
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:07,237
You know what you failed to
anticipate, Mark?

378
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:12,432
How lonely I would get
with you gone for months at a time!

379
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:15,114
And I also failed to anticipate

380
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:20,556
that you would turn into
a faithless, demented whore

381
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:24,794
who would use peanut
butter to seduce your own dog!

382
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:33,755
What's in your duffel bag, Mark?
What did you do?

383
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:35,558
What was I supposed to do?

384
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:41,869
What any man would do
to his wife's lover.

385
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:17,516
Poor dog, never even saw it coming.

386
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:21,913
Seduced by a weakness for peanut butter
and a blind trust in humans.

387
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:26,474
This way, boys. It's out the back entrance.

388
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:35,072
Liz, I'm so sorry
about what happened to you.

389
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:41,156
If you ever need anything,
anything at all, don't hesitate to ask.

390
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:50,918
Careful, Christian.

391
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:54,151
Based on recent events,
it should be crystal clear

392
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:57,118
that there's a reason
that some fruit is forbidden.

393
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:01,718
I think you've had enough exercise
for today, Lizzy.

394
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:03,678
Let's get you back to bed.

395
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:12,752
You're Michelle's friend.

396
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:17,915
She'll be back in a minute, she just
went to take care of some business.

397
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,433
It's not a problem.

398
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:25,276
- Who's that?
- She's the one.

399
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:31,518
You know, the one who very obviously
was not fondling Michelle in the garage.

400
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:54,635
- How was your day?
- It was good. It was better, in fact.

401
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:57,193
I'm glad to hear that.

402
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:01,314
It's growing on me, what do you think?

403
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:05,234
Not sure yet.

404
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:08,834
- Want a beer?
- Sure.

405
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:47,599
Oh, my God, I'm so glad you came.

406
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,188
Come in.

407
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:54,319
I could use a drink.

408
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:57,319
I've got the ticket.

409
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:03,991
Actually, I'd prefer a Scotch.

410
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:08,515
They're hash brownies.
I made them this afternoon.

411
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:13,199
There's nothing better
than making love stoned.

412
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:15,078
Take off your tie, Doc.

413
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:27,154
Take your tie off, pussy.

414
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:30,277
I mean, you can't take her ass
with your tie on, right?

415
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:35,598
This is some good shit.

416
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:38,273
What are you doing here?

417
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:41,432
Hell was full,
so I came up to chaperone your ass.

418
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:44,669
You know how much I love a party, Sean.

419
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:05,395
What do you want?

420
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:09,598
No, my friend, I believe the question is
what do you want?

421
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:14,268
I believe you want this.
So take off your pants and be a man.

422
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:17,836
I think that's what I would do.

423
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:20,271
Won't turn out well, my love.

424
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:22,715
Megan? Oh, God.

425
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:25,870
Sometimes I miss you so much.

426
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:27,871
I'm always with you, Sean.

427
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:31,873
Hey, Sean, screw this cancer bitch,
she's a dead lady.

428
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:36,029
You got a live one here all ready to go.

429
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:41,230
- She's not what you want.
- I don't know what I want anymore.

430
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:45,076
Here's what you want.
It's called Daddy's Little Helper.

431
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:48,232
From the tree of knowledge.
Knowledge is power, Sean.

432
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:52,029
And power is taking that bitch's ass.

433
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:56,715
Come on. That's right, that's my boy.

434
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:59,234
You can do it. Come on. Come on, bite it.

435
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:02,916
You're just afraid. Go home.

436
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:05,751
They all need you now.

437
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:07,796
I can't keep being
everything to everybody.

438
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:09,438
I can't take the pressure anymore.

439
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:12,796
Then bust a hard nut, Sean,
and relieve the pressure, man.

440
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:20,629
I don't want this. I'm not you.

441
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:23,395
Sean, yes, you are.

442
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:31,432
Is this what you want?
Is this who you want to be?

443
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:36,993
Sean, your baby's a freak.
Make her pay for what she did to you.

444
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:40,789
Make God pay for giving you a baby
with lobster hands.

445
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:42,279
I love my baby.

446
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:45,278
I love him no matter what.

447
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:52,797
Do you still love me, Sean?
Or do you blame me for Conor?

448
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:56,953
Is that why you're doing this?
To make me pay? To hurt me?

449
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:58,678
I don't wanna hurt you.

450
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:04,119
I love you.

451
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:11,037
I love you too, Sean.

452
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,189
No.

453
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:24,155
You're lovely, and I want you, but no.

454
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:28,071
I'm gonna go home now.

455
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:47,908
- Hello, sweetheart.
- Hello, darling.

456
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:51,998
Look who stopped by
to check your old man's balls.

457
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:55,599
I guess you told him
I wasn't feeling well, huh?

458
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:57,669
Is everything okay?

459
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:00,593
Just a small hematoma from the surgery.
Nothing to worry about.

460
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:03,797
What's up, honey?
You look like you had a long day.

461
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:06,953
- It's... It's been a hard one.
- Wasn't it?

462
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:10,270
We had
an emergency facial reconstruction.

463
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:11,554
Bad car crash.

464
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:16,675
Actually, the patient, I believe,
was a friend of your wife's.

465
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:18,193
You know, the very stylish-looking woman

466
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:21,158
that Liz met in the parking garage
a few weeks ago.

467
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,518
Maybe you just missed her.

468
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:31,110
Like I said, it's been a long day.

469
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:33,948
I'm going to take a shower.

470
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:37,191
Thanks for stopping by, Christian.
I'll see you tomorrow.

471
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:40,638
Actually, Michelle,
I'll be keeping you company all night.

472
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:42,836
Burt's asked me to stay for dinner.

473
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:55,230
Who's the mystery woman, Michelle?

474
00:40:57,640 --> 00:40:59,039
Is she your lover?

475
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:06,956
Liz is a lonely woman
with a vivid imagination.

476
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:14,358
I'll see you at dinner.

477
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:19,239
Where, just so you know, I plan
on telling your husband, my other boss,

478
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:21,388
that I went through the records today

479
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:24,552
and realized we operated on a person
that didn't even exist.

480
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:26,710
A phantom patient, unbilled.

481
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:30,831
Burt would find that fascinating,
don't you think?

482
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:33,673
Christian, I'm not having an affair with her.

483
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:36,748
- Leave it alone.
- You talk or I will.

484
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:43,079
Lock the door.

485
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:58,072
Her name is James.
She runs a modeling agency.

486
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:00,116
And I'm indebted to her.

487
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:05,270
So indebted you agreed
to work on her little protégée for free?

488
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:11,270
And you let her squeeze your tits.

489
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:13,352
So, what's real, Michelle?

490
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:15,715
Is it all lies? Did you go to medical school?

491
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:19,429
Yes, I did. And James paid for it.

492
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:21,954
In exchange for what?
A modeling contract?

493
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:24,151
- In a way.
- Give me a straight answer, God damn it!

494
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:26,117
I was an escort.

495
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:32,314
I did it for a year and a half.

496
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:34,197
And then I couldn't take it anymore

497
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:37,431
so I quit medical school
and then I quit working for her.

498
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:39,758
So when did you meet Burt?

499
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:43,598
Before or after you
quit sucking dick for lunch money?

500
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:44,715
After.

501
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:46,711
And you saw your out
and you married him.

502
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:49,231
But now James
wants a piece of the action. I get it.

503
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:50,719
I thought I'd made my final payment,

504
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:54,349
but now she won't let me go,
or let me forget where I came from.

505
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:56,599
She's a psychopath.

506
00:42:56,680 --> 00:42:58,830
So you have a fatal attraction
for the good life.

507
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:00,273
Just like you do.

508
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:06,596
Please, please, don't tell Burt.

509
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:10,673
He doesn't deserve to be hurt.
He loves me.

510
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:14,791
I won't tell him your secret,
if you don't tell him mine.

511
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:16,313
What's your secret?

512
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:21,114
That I made love to his wife before dinner.

513
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:51,350
Should I be flattered, or worried?

514
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:55,919
It's beautiful.

515
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:04,797
It's just perfect.

516
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:14,717
Can you feed him, please? I am so tired.

517
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:16,677
- Julia...
- Please.

518
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:18,748
I can't.

519
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:30,076
That's an interesting word
you used to describe my work.

520
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:31,828
Perfect.

521
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:33,595
You don't say it out loud,

522
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:36,831
but sometimes you must think to yourself
that Conor is so imperfect.

523
00:44:36,920 --> 00:44:39,309
It's not something I like to talk about.

524
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,230
You have a deformed child, Julia.

525
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:46,310
It's not gonna go away
just because you don't say it out loud.

526
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:48,753
Come on, sweetie.

527
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:55,230
I just can't help thinking
you can't feel all the loving, tender things

528
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:57,709
without feeling the painful things, too.

529
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:01,110
You can't have one without the other.

530
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:10,196
My mother told me once
that she wished she had aborted me.

531
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:16,350
Naturally, I was a pretty angry kid.

532
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:19,119
Not unlike your son.

533
00:45:26,080 --> 00:45:29,117
We were at an abortion clinic, Sean and I.

534
00:45:31,560 --> 00:45:33,118
Conor was a mistake.

535
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:43,359
We were separated at the time
and I guess we just got lonely.

536
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:48,278
I never knew what happened,
but you know,

537
00:45:48,360 --> 00:45:51,750
we were sitting there and then
we just got up and left.

538
00:45:53,720 --> 00:45:55,233
We never said it to each other,

539
00:45:55,320 --> 00:46:02,271
but we knew that this baby
was our last hope of making it together.

540
00:46:06,320 --> 00:46:09,437
God forgive me,
I should have gone through with it.

541
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:12,193
I wish I had.

542
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:19,515
You know, Sean can't handle it, either.

543
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:24,438
You know, he acts like he can,
but he feels the same way I do. I know it.

544
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,116
We blew it with our normal, healthy child,

545
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:31,033
what hope do we have
of doing right by this one?

546
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:36,518
Hey.

547
00:46:43,640 --> 00:46:48,919
What did you do,
put some kind of magic spell on us?

548
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:56,632
I didn't do anything.

549
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:06,918
- Hi.
- Hey.

550
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:13,159
Can you believe it?

551
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:18,712
You do realize you're not supposed
to nurse if you're taking anti-depressants.

552
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:22,312
I filled the prescription,
but I didn't take it yet.

553
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:34,598
The mural's beautiful.

554
00:47:41,160 --> 00:47:43,549
A perfect world, before the fall.

555
00:48:29,160 --> 00:48:30,229
