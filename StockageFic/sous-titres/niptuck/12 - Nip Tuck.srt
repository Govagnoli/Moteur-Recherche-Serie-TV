1
00:00:09,729 --> 00:00:11,697
<i>Previously on Nip / Tuck:</i>

2
00:00:17,503 --> 00:00:20,165
Silvio stole that money!

3
00:00:20,273 --> 00:00:23,037
Yeah, that's right, asshole. I'm pregnant.

4
00:01:39,018 --> 00:01:40,178
Great.

5
00:01:43,156 --> 00:01:44,180
Good God.

6
00:01:44,257 --> 00:01:47,385
Every time I see what women do
to themselves with these tit jobs...

7
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:49,792
it makes me ashamed
of what I do for a living.

8
00:01:49,862 --> 00:01:52,854
These tit jobs are 70°% of our business, Liz.

9
00:01:53,266 --> 00:01:56,667
Think about that the next time
you slip your grossly overpaid ass...

10
00:01:56,736 --> 00:01:59,330
into your courtside seats at the WNBA.

11
00:02:01,307 --> 00:02:04,276
So, was Julia completely insane
when she was pregnant?

12
00:02:04,343 --> 00:02:06,038
No more than usual. Why?

13
00:02:06,112 --> 00:02:08,979
Gina just seems
particularly out of her mind lately.

14
00:02:09,048 --> 00:02:12,381
Apparently, so are you.
I can't believe you're sticking with this.

15
00:02:12,452 --> 00:02:15,615
She's keeping the child, Sean.
What was I supposed to do?

16
00:02:55,962 --> 00:02:58,954
This poor woman.
Those guys are butchers down there.

17
00:02:59,031 --> 00:03:01,966
I don't even think Bobolit
puts in doubles anymore.

18
00:03:02,969 --> 00:03:04,459
There. You all right?

19
00:03:04,537 --> 00:03:06,732
Okay, last one. Got it.

20
00:03:08,307 --> 00:03:10,400
Does this look like saline to you?

21
00:03:10,476 --> 00:03:12,876
The color's off. So is the consistency.

22
00:03:12,945 --> 00:03:15,345
What the hell are they putting
in these things there?

23
00:03:15,414 --> 00:03:16,608
Heroin.

24
00:03:18,484 --> 00:03:22,045
That tit you're holding is worth $250,000.

25
00:03:22,788 --> 00:03:24,415
What do you want?

26
00:03:24,657 --> 00:03:27,353
What's mine. Pepe, fetch the tits.

27
00:03:41,474 --> 00:03:45,274
Now finish sewing her up.
I'll wait in Dr. McNamara's office.

28
00:03:45,344 --> 00:03:47,437
I can't stand the sight of blood.

29
00:04:41,334 --> 00:04:42,892
Where's the dyke?

30
00:04:42,969 --> 00:04:45,301
Still throwing up her McGriddle.

31
00:04:45,404 --> 00:04:48,532
-And how's my Maria doing?
-Resting comfortably in recovery.

32
00:04:48,608 --> 00:04:50,075
When will she be ready to travel?

33
00:04:50,142 --> 00:04:52,804
I have to get her back to Colombia
to get implanted again.

34
00:04:52,878 --> 00:04:54,311
You can't put her through that.

35
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:57,076
Her muscle tissue was terribly damaged
by the last surgery.

36
00:04:57,149 --> 00:05:00,175
She could lose all feeling in her breasts
if you try again.

37
00:05:00,253 --> 00:05:03,518
Small price to pay
for the chance at the American dream.

38
00:05:03,889 --> 00:05:06,881
That girI begged to be my mule,
just to get into this country.

39
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:09,689
Who are we to judge her
if she wants something better...

40
00:05:09,762 --> 00:05:12,424
something you two
take for granted every day?

41
00:05:12,798 --> 00:05:14,959
I've heard enough of this bullshit.

42
00:05:15,034 --> 00:05:17,594
She's not going anywhere.
I'm calling the cops.

43
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:21,606
You do that, Dr. Troy. I had some things
I wanted to discuss with them...

44
00:05:21,674 --> 00:05:25,667
about a former patient of yours.
You guys remember Silvio Perez, right?

45
00:05:26,812 --> 00:05:29,906
I'm sure you remember
where you dumped his body.

46
00:05:35,721 --> 00:05:37,313
Now let's talk shop.

47
00:05:38,457 --> 00:05:41,085
Your business and mine are a lot alike.

48
00:05:41,727 --> 00:05:45,026
We help people deaI with the hate
they feeI about themselves.

49
00:05:45,097 --> 00:05:49,966
You do it by carving up their faces.
I do it by dulling their senses.

50
00:05:50,703 --> 00:05:52,694
A nose job, an eight ball....

51
00:05:53,172 --> 00:05:54,730
What's the difference?

52
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:58,901
Now, what keeps us in business
are two things. One:

53
00:05:59,745 --> 00:06:03,909
People are always
going to hate themselves.

54
00:06:05,284 --> 00:06:09,220
Two: We do our jobs
with the utmost precision.

55
00:06:10,589 --> 00:06:14,787
No scars, no loose ends,
and no missing $300,000.

56
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:16,691
I want my money back.

57
00:06:18,264 --> 00:06:19,629
What money?

58
00:06:19,965 --> 00:06:23,799
The money Silvio Perez stole from me
to pay for his new face.

59
00:06:24,136 --> 00:06:26,730
Now, I'll give you a week to pay me back...

60
00:06:26,806 --> 00:06:29,798
because you guys
did such a nice job on Maria.

61
00:06:33,979 --> 00:06:37,415
We don't have access to that kind of cash.
We spent it...

62
00:06:38,084 --> 00:06:40,814
-on business improvements.
-Not my problem.

63
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:43,354
We're not liquid right now. Sorry.

64
00:06:53,733 --> 00:06:57,931
That's a pretty wife, Dr. McNamara.
I could get it up for her.

65
00:06:59,271 --> 00:07:00,738
She work out?

66
00:07:04,744 --> 00:07:07,304
Remember your guiding principles, ladies:

67
00:07:08,214 --> 00:07:09,374
Form...

68
00:07:10,082 --> 00:07:11,413
precision...

69
00:07:12,251 --> 00:07:13,616
breathing.

70
00:07:14,353 --> 00:07:15,980
Find your core...

71
00:07:16,288 --> 00:07:19,280
and then just let your muscles
obey your will.

72
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:22,425
And lift...

73
00:07:23,729 --> 00:07:24,991
and switch.

74
00:07:27,967 --> 00:07:29,161
Julia.

75
00:07:30,002 --> 00:07:33,028
-Color me shocked.
-Shoulders pulled down your back.

76
00:07:33,105 --> 00:07:37,166
Never in a million years
would I imagine you'd give up Jude...

77
00:07:37,243 --> 00:07:39,541
-for us mere mortals.
-Long necks.

78
00:07:40,146 --> 00:07:42,307
-How's your core these days?
-Long lines.

79
00:07:42,381 --> 00:07:44,975
Overextended. How's your divorce?

80
00:07:45,751 --> 00:07:47,844
Going around, from what I hear.

81
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:50,684
Annie told Tory
that Mommy and Daddy aren't talking.

82
00:07:50,756 --> 00:07:53,418
-Let's do some roll-ups.
-My sympathies, Julia.

83
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:56,657
Raise up your arms...

84
00:07:56,996 --> 00:08:00,261
and roll up, with your head
and shoulders following.

85
00:08:01,133 --> 00:08:02,691
Deepen the curve...

86
00:08:04,503 --> 00:08:06,494
and exhale rolling down.

87
00:08:06,806 --> 00:08:08,068
Shoulders down your back.

88
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:10,938
Julia McNamara, right? Sophia Lopez.

89
00:08:12,244 --> 00:08:16,510
Oh, my manners! I'm sorry.
I am a patient of your husband's.

90
00:08:18,083 --> 00:08:20,643
You're just as pretty as in your picture.

91
00:08:20,719 --> 00:08:25,452
Right. Of course. Yeah.
Sophia, he's told me all about you.

92
00:08:25,524 --> 00:08:27,685
And he's told me all about you, too.

93
00:08:28,594 --> 00:08:33,054
Especially, Julia, about how yoga Pilates
really works for you.

94
00:08:33,499 --> 00:08:37,367
Dr. McNamara thought it would work
for me, too. Maybe lengthen my muscles.

95
00:08:37,436 --> 00:08:40,064
Make them look feminine
and lean like yours.

96
00:08:40,139 --> 00:08:43,540
Pull the belly off the floor.
Bellybutton to spine.

97
00:08:43,876 --> 00:08:46,003
Goodness, I feeI like Gumby.

98
00:08:46,078 --> 00:08:47,875
lnhale as you extend.

99
00:08:48,848 --> 00:08:50,213
Exhale down.

100
00:08:52,184 --> 00:08:54,880
Sit back on your heels to child's pose.

101
00:08:57,022 --> 00:08:59,013
Extend your back and breathe.

102
00:08:59,792 --> 00:09:01,817
-Good.
-Maybe after we're done...

103
00:09:03,062 --> 00:09:05,257
I could treat you to a smoothie.

104
00:09:05,664 --> 00:09:07,928
Sophia, l'd love to...

105
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,094
but I have to pick
my daughter up after school...

106
00:09:11,170 --> 00:09:12,603
and then I have a class, so....

107
00:09:12,671 --> 00:09:15,367
Excellent. Roll up to sitting...

108
00:09:17,209 --> 00:09:20,804
<i>and namaste. Thank you, class.
Great work today.</i>

109
00:09:31,390 --> 00:09:34,723
Do you have to eat that on my bed?
Those are $1,100 sheets.

110
00:09:34,793 --> 00:09:36,693
I have to eat, asshole.

111
00:09:37,029 --> 00:09:39,361
Fat makes the baby's brain grow.

112
00:09:41,901 --> 00:09:44,529
This bed has sharp corners. Not good.

113
00:09:44,637 --> 00:09:48,266
We're gonna have to babyproof this
before junior shows up.

114
00:09:49,808 --> 00:09:52,470
Too bad you didn't babyproof it before.

115
00:09:53,145 --> 00:09:56,512
Here. I earmarked the stuff we need.

116
00:10:02,721 --> 00:10:04,279
$4,000 for a pram?

117
00:10:04,356 --> 00:10:07,325
It's a Burberry. They're all the rage.

118
00:10:08,694 --> 00:10:11,060
Here. This one's half the price.

119
00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:14,497
Yeah, screw you
and your $1,100 sheets, asshole!

120
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,400
-You have the money.
-No, I don't!

121
00:10:22,841 --> 00:10:24,866
Jesus! What's up your ass?

122
00:10:25,978 --> 00:10:27,946
Hard day at work.

123
00:10:29,448 --> 00:10:31,439
I'm just a little tense.

124
00:10:32,284 --> 00:10:33,410
Really?

125
00:10:36,021 --> 00:10:40,515
Well, I could think of
a couple of interesting ways to relax.

126
00:10:44,330 --> 00:10:46,764
What's the matter?
Not turned on by pregnant women?

127
00:10:46,832 --> 00:10:48,959
No, just not turned on by you.

128
00:10:52,304 --> 00:10:54,534
-Sorry.
-Me, too.

129
00:10:55,441 --> 00:10:56,772
I'm repulsive.

130
00:10:58,043 --> 00:11:00,170
No more so than usual, sweetheart.

131
00:11:00,245 --> 00:11:04,477
Spare me, Christian. I know
how pathetic I am, coming on to you.

132
00:11:04,617 --> 00:11:07,108
You know, it's these damn hormones.

133
00:11:08,354 --> 00:11:11,016
What is this? You still smoking?

134
00:11:11,123 --> 00:11:13,614
How else am I supposed
to deaI with my cravings?

135
00:11:13,692 --> 00:11:17,150
The withdrawaI is hard on the baby.
I can only eat so much.

136
00:11:17,997 --> 00:11:20,761
What, would you rather I suck on these
or some random guy?

137
00:11:20,833 --> 00:11:24,064
Do you have any idea the damage
that cigarettes have on a fetus?

138
00:11:24,136 --> 00:11:25,501
Try acupuncture.

139
00:11:25,571 --> 00:11:28,597
That would take care of my addiction,
not my oraI fixation.

140
00:11:28,674 --> 00:11:31,768
Then I will buy you
a bag of goddamn lollipops!

141
00:11:33,679 --> 00:11:35,670
-No more of these.
-Fine.

142
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:40,677
But I get the Burberry pram.

143
00:11:44,723 --> 00:11:48,090
<i>-Did you sell a shirt?
- The Boatox. $140,000 for my speedboat.</i>

144
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,594
Can you believe it?
It's worth at least $75,000 more.

145
00:11:50,663 --> 00:11:53,131
We're lucky that Bobolit
had this kind of cash around.

146
00:11:53,198 --> 00:11:55,758
-ls that all you got?
-No, I hocked my Rolex for $20,000.

147
00:11:55,834 --> 00:11:56,823
How much did you get?

148
00:11:56,902 --> 00:11:59,803
I emptied our family emergency fund
and my personaI account...

149
00:11:59,872 --> 00:12:02,306
called in a few outstanding bills.

150
00:12:02,541 --> 00:12:03,633
And?

151
00:12:04,343 --> 00:12:06,208
I'm at $25,000 right now.

152
00:12:06,945 --> 00:12:08,435
-What?
-I'm sorry, Christian.

153
00:12:08,514 --> 00:12:11,642
I have a wife and kids.
I don't have the disposable income you do.

154
00:12:11,717 --> 00:12:14,686
I could cash in some bonds,
but I'm gonna take a bath on them.

155
00:12:14,753 --> 00:12:18,382
Then get wet, Sean! I sold my baby.
You need to come up with some money.

156
00:12:18,457 --> 00:12:21,017
I know that. Any ideas?

157
00:12:21,226 --> 00:12:25,287
I guess you're gonna have to take on
a few less desirable clients.

158
00:12:32,271 --> 00:12:34,831
Tell me what you don't like about yourself.

159
00:12:39,645 --> 00:12:42,341
I'll need the money
for your surgery up-front...

160
00:12:43,282 --> 00:12:44,613
and in cash.

161
00:12:52,424 --> 00:12:53,721
Here you go.

162
00:12:57,963 --> 00:13:00,124
Sure you're not hungry, guys?

163
00:13:01,967 --> 00:13:05,562
My girlfriend, she loves
the hot shit restaurants in town...

164
00:13:05,637 --> 00:13:07,468
but I prefer it here.

165
00:13:07,639 --> 00:13:09,869
Nothing beats a fruity tooty.

166
00:13:23,355 --> 00:13:25,448
He's your personaI taster?

167
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:28,859
With power comes envy.

168
00:13:30,062 --> 00:13:32,292
With envy comes assassination.

169
00:13:33,265 --> 00:13:36,792
Maybe if you laid off the cocaine,
you wouldn't be so paranoid.

170
00:13:37,703 --> 00:13:39,728
You need to watch your mouth.

171
00:13:39,972 --> 00:13:42,770
I don't tolerate rudeness
during the dinner hour.

172
00:13:46,178 --> 00:13:47,702
You got the money?

173
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:52,842
It's a little short.

174
00:13:53,552 --> 00:13:55,144
$20,000 at most.

175
00:13:55,654 --> 00:13:57,849
That's not what we discussed, gentlemen.

176
00:13:57,923 --> 00:13:59,652
We'll get the rest.

177
00:14:00,292 --> 00:14:01,782
Don't worry about it.

178
00:14:02,795 --> 00:14:05,787
-I've got another girI coming in.
-Another girl?

179
00:14:06,031 --> 00:14:08,397
<i>Si. You know, otro burro.</i>

180
00:14:09,234 --> 00:14:11,259
But getting in isn't easy.

181
00:14:11,637 --> 00:14:14,231
Not for them, and not for my shit.

182
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:17,140
Especially after 9/1 1 .

183
00:14:17,342 --> 00:14:19,071
So we make a deal.

184
00:14:19,311 --> 00:14:22,474
I get them a work permit
through the modeling agency...

185
00:14:22,714 --> 00:14:24,944
I set up in Fort Lauderdale...

186
00:14:25,017 --> 00:14:27,918
and in return,
they carry something in for me.

187
00:14:28,754 --> 00:14:30,449
Three trips for me...

188
00:14:31,190 --> 00:14:34,751
and they're free
to pursue the American dream.

189
00:14:35,561 --> 00:14:37,222
And everybody wins.

190
00:14:37,596 --> 00:14:40,394
Except for these poor girls
who have their chests butchered.

191
00:14:40,465 --> 00:14:43,434
My method beats
12-year-olds swallowing...

192
00:14:43,502 --> 00:14:48,201
20 rubbers full of rock cocaine
and swimming across the Rio Grande.

193
00:14:50,008 --> 00:14:52,272
We're not gonna operate
on your slaves anymore.

194
00:14:52,344 --> 00:14:55,142
We'll get you your money,
and then we'll be done.

195
00:14:59,284 --> 00:15:01,411
I tell you when you're done.

196
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:03,612
And know this:

197
00:15:05,224 --> 00:15:08,591
lf you don't do
what I've asked you politely to do...

198
00:15:08,794 --> 00:15:11,854
I'll take this hand
back to Colombia with me.

199
00:15:12,297 --> 00:15:17,257
And then your family will learn
what it means to be hungry.

200
00:15:29,948 --> 00:15:31,711
This fabric is cheap.

201
00:15:31,783 --> 00:15:35,082
It's nylon. Babies piss and shit.

202
00:15:35,153 --> 00:15:38,589
Then find it in basic black,
because I am not wearing orange.

203
00:15:38,657 --> 00:15:42,423
Bad news, folks. Your Burberry pram's
back-ordered for 16 weeks.

204
00:15:42,494 --> 00:15:45,190
Oh, shit, goddamn it!

205
00:15:47,165 --> 00:15:49,895
Have you met the mother of my child?
lsn't she lovely?

206
00:15:49,968 --> 00:15:53,802
It's a mommy thing. I get it.
What are you about, what, six months?

207
00:15:54,506 --> 00:15:57,270
-I'm six months and four days.
-Any kicking yet?

208
00:15:58,443 --> 00:16:00,604
Awesome! I just feIt something.

209
00:16:00,679 --> 00:16:03,204
It's probably just gas
from the three burritos.

210
00:16:03,282 --> 00:16:06,115
I have cravings,
and he doesn't understand.

211
00:16:06,318 --> 00:16:09,947
Tell you what. I'm gonna
sneak you to the top of the list.

212
00:16:10,188 --> 00:16:14,625
-One of my ladies isn't due for six months.
-Really? God, that would be so fantastic.

213
00:16:14,693 --> 00:16:16,092
No problem.

214
00:16:19,398 --> 00:16:20,729
Excuse me.

215
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,492
-Brad? I want to see that crib over there.
-Okay, I'll show you.

216
00:16:25,837 --> 00:16:26,997
Hello.

217
00:16:27,072 --> 00:16:30,132
The flight arrives at 7:00.
Be at your office by 8:00.

218
00:16:30,342 --> 00:16:32,173
<i>Leave the door unlocked.</i>

219
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:45,584
This is my address,
and you just have everything sent to here.

220
00:16:45,657 --> 00:16:48,888
-Great. I'll go get the color swatches.
-Okay. Thank you.

221
00:16:54,266 --> 00:16:57,394
You gave a clerk your address,
but you won't give it to me?

222
00:16:57,469 --> 00:17:00,927
Grow up, Gina.
We're having a baby. Together.

223
00:17:01,506 --> 00:17:03,235
I have a right to know where you live.

224
00:17:03,308 --> 00:17:06,277
Wrong. You have no rights
untiI you earn them.

225
00:17:06,345 --> 00:17:10,304
And give the guy your credit card.
I'm going next door to Baskin-Robbins.

226
00:17:13,352 --> 00:17:16,253
Okay, that'll be $4,250 plus tax.

227
00:17:25,263 --> 00:17:28,391
Say, Brad, can I take a look
at that order form?

228
00:17:28,934 --> 00:17:30,902
She wants to give you
her cell phone number.

229
00:17:30,969 --> 00:17:35,303
-Okay. Great. It's right there.
-Thanks.

230
00:17:39,478 --> 00:17:42,413
Just put your Jane Hancock
on the "X," Julia.

231
00:17:43,849 --> 00:17:47,717
-What's the petition for?
-To ban the trannie from our Pilates class.

232
00:17:50,389 --> 00:17:52,823
Don't you think that's a little harsh?

233
00:17:52,891 --> 00:17:56,327
Pilates is a sacred gift
we moms give ourselves.

234
00:17:56,628 --> 00:17:59,529
You know, I don't want the pressure
of having to wear makeup...

235
00:17:59,598 --> 00:18:02,431
or shave my legs
for some man in our midst.

236
00:18:02,534 --> 00:18:06,834
Sophia is a woman, and Sean
has assured me that she's into men.

237
00:18:06,905 --> 00:18:10,397
I get The Learning Channel.
I know how they do the operation.

238
00:18:10,475 --> 00:18:15,174
All they do is slice the penis in half like at
a weenie roast and then shove it all inside.

239
00:18:15,247 --> 00:18:17,772
-Suzanne!
-No, let me finish, Julia.

240
00:18:17,983 --> 00:18:22,079
The bottom line is if you've got a dick,
find a coed gym.

241
00:18:24,189 --> 00:18:26,487
Sorry, Suzanne. I'm not signing it.

242
00:18:26,958 --> 00:18:30,621
It's cruel. It's inhumane.

243
00:18:32,164 --> 00:18:34,689
Okay, Julia. Have it your way.

244
00:18:35,333 --> 00:18:39,531
I mean, the truth is, sweetie,
all the other moms in class have signed.

245
00:18:39,604 --> 00:18:42,072
That means I present the petition
to the teacher...

246
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:45,337
and Sophia Lopez is off to crunch.

247
00:18:51,516 --> 00:18:52,915
Suzanne, wait.

248
00:18:54,086 --> 00:18:57,351
Don't turn in the petition.
Let me talk to her.

249
00:18:57,756 --> 00:19:00,486
Maybe I can save her the embarrassment.

250
00:19:01,593 --> 00:19:05,324
Gently suggest that perhaps
this class isn't a good fit.

251
00:19:06,131 --> 00:19:08,793
Julia, you are so brave.

252
00:19:14,606 --> 00:19:18,303
This is insane! They just call
and expect us to jump? Forget it.

253
00:19:18,376 --> 00:19:20,537
Stall untiI we think up a way
to get out of this.

254
00:19:20,612 --> 00:19:24,343
Drug lords don't have voice mail, Sean.
And this is our way out of this.

255
00:19:24,416 --> 00:19:26,543
One more operation, and we walk away.

256
00:19:26,718 --> 00:19:29,915
He won't call the police.
He's bluffing. We bluff right back.

257
00:19:30,021 --> 00:19:33,787
The last time I called his bluff,
I got a shot of BOTOX in my dick!

258
00:19:33,859 --> 00:19:38,125
Trust me, this guy's dangerous.
We're stuck, and we're doing this.

259
00:20:12,464 --> 00:20:14,557
I said I wanted a Burberry.

260
00:20:14,766 --> 00:20:16,961
It's an additionaI present.

261
00:20:17,469 --> 00:20:19,664
Why didn't you tell me
you live on a houseboat?

262
00:20:19,738 --> 00:20:22,400
Jesus, you make me crazy over
babyproofing bed corners...

263
00:20:22,474 --> 00:20:25,102
and you live on
a goddamn floating deathtrap.

264
00:20:25,177 --> 00:20:26,804
Nobody invited you.

265
00:20:26,878 --> 00:20:30,279
There are rats the size of toddlers
down here at the docks.

266
00:20:30,348 --> 00:20:33,943
There's water everywhere.
He could fall off and drown.

267
00:20:34,019 --> 00:20:35,213
Or she.

268
00:20:35,921 --> 00:20:39,186
-Are you stupid?
-I told you I couldn't do this alone.

269
00:20:39,257 --> 00:20:40,918
You can't do it at all.

270
00:20:41,259 --> 00:20:43,750
Take your shitty stroller
and take your judgments...

271
00:20:43,828 --> 00:20:45,693
and get the hell off my property, asshole.

272
00:20:45,764 --> 00:20:47,629
At least move to a trailer park.

273
00:20:47,699 --> 00:20:52,102
There's lot of drunk, hard up men who'll
sleep with anything. You'd like it there.

274
00:21:17,729 --> 00:21:20,220
Dinner will be ready in 20 minutes.

275
00:21:20,665 --> 00:21:22,257
Where you going?

276
00:21:23,268 --> 00:21:26,203
-Late surgery.
-Who has surgery at this hour?

277
00:21:26,805 --> 00:21:29,672
-Busy patient.
-Well, thanks for the notice, Sean.

278
00:21:29,741 --> 00:21:32,904
lf I knew you wouldn't be here,
I wouldn't have made all this food.

279
00:21:32,978 --> 00:21:36,846
lf I don't go to work, there won't be
any food to put on the table!

280
00:21:43,722 --> 00:21:45,986
Screw it! We're going to McDonald's.

281
00:21:46,725 --> 00:21:49,091
Mom, I know what you're thinking...

282
00:21:50,395 --> 00:21:53,228
that Dad's.... You know.

283
00:21:55,166 --> 00:21:57,634
He told me about the affair.

284
00:21:59,437 --> 00:22:02,372
He'll never do it again.
That's not what's going on.

285
00:22:03,108 --> 00:22:06,043
Your father should
never have told you that.

286
00:22:07,946 --> 00:22:09,811
At least he didn't lie to me, Mom.

287
00:22:09,881 --> 00:22:12,372
Stop protecting him, Matt, and me!

288
00:22:12,684 --> 00:22:17,018
It is so damn inappropriate!
We're your parents, not your pals.

289
00:22:17,422 --> 00:22:21,017
A concept some people in this house
have lost totaI track of.

290
00:22:33,204 --> 00:22:36,469
Do you know
what's going on with him lately?

291
00:22:37,242 --> 00:22:38,334
Nope.

292
00:22:39,577 --> 00:22:42,341
Which is apparently just great,
because according to you...

293
00:22:42,414 --> 00:22:45,474
what happens in this family
is none of my business.

294
00:23:03,268 --> 00:23:05,065
Hey, guys. What's up?

295
00:23:05,637 --> 00:23:07,298
Celebrity surgery.

296
00:23:07,706 --> 00:23:10,732
You know how private
these aging pop singers are.

297
00:23:17,215 --> 00:23:20,116
Liz, you need to leave.

298
00:23:21,152 --> 00:23:25,213
Why, Christian? So you can remove
more implants filled with heroin...

299
00:23:25,290 --> 00:23:27,724
without a proper anesthesiologist?

300
00:23:27,792 --> 00:23:29,692
That's not what we're doing.

301
00:23:29,761 --> 00:23:34,095
Cut the bullshit, Sean. I know what's
going on. I can see the fear in your eyes.

302
00:23:39,404 --> 00:23:42,396
Liz, this is dangerous. Don't do this for us.

303
00:23:42,674 --> 00:23:44,539
I'm not doing it for you, Christian.

304
00:23:44,609 --> 00:23:48,067
I'm doing it for the girls
that monster is using as his mules.

305
00:23:48,146 --> 00:23:52,810
I can't give them back their dignity, but
I can damn well lessen their physicaI pain.

306
00:23:52,884 --> 00:23:54,283
I'm staying.

307
00:24:00,291 --> 00:24:04,318
Change of plans. We've got a big problem.
Get your stuff.

308
00:24:54,245 --> 00:24:57,544
Old school.
Guys, don't you miss the '80s, man?

309
00:25:05,089 --> 00:25:08,388
Yo, what's up? How you doing, man?
Let me give you a tour.

310
00:25:25,477 --> 00:25:28,640
Her fever's easily over 102.
How long has she been like this?

311
00:25:28,713 --> 00:25:31,511
She told Pepe
she was puking on the plane.

312
00:25:31,683 --> 00:25:35,084
lf the implant broke, you're gonna
have to scrape out whatever leaked.

313
00:25:35,153 --> 00:25:38,418
<i>I'm not leaving any of my shit
in this puta 's tits.</i>

314
00:25:38,523 --> 00:25:40,115
What's her name?

315
00:25:40,992 --> 00:25:42,220
Antonia Ramos.

316
00:25:44,128 --> 00:25:47,359
Antonia? Ms. Ramos? You speak English?

317
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:50,525
<i>Si. Yes.</i>

318
00:25:50,869 --> 00:25:54,066
My name is Dr. Troy.
Would you mind if I take a look?

319
00:25:54,138 --> 00:25:55,162
No.

320
00:26:00,211 --> 00:26:03,374
These aren't symptoms of
a heroin overdose but of sepsis.

321
00:26:03,448 --> 00:26:05,382
She's got an acute bacteriaI infection...

322
00:26:05,450 --> 00:26:08,942
undoubtedly from filthy instruments
used by your South American butchers.

323
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:10,112
That's good, right?

324
00:26:10,188 --> 00:26:12,748
No. lf it spreads to her heart or lungs,
she could die.

325
00:26:12,824 --> 00:26:15,384
-Can you put her out?
-I'll run an lV, give her Versed.

326
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:18,361
-She won't remember.
-Let's move her. All right, on three.

327
00:26:18,429 --> 00:26:21,398
Antonia, we're gonna move you, all right?
Two, three, go.

328
00:26:21,466 --> 00:26:25,732
It's okay. We're gonna give you a shot,
Antonia, and you're gonna be all right.

329
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:32,406
It's okay, sweetie. It won't even sting.
Okay, we're tight.

330
00:26:35,046 --> 00:26:36,138
Okay.

331
00:26:57,001 --> 00:26:58,662
Okay. Here we go.

332
00:27:06,277 --> 00:27:07,938
Ready? Go.

333
00:27:16,054 --> 00:27:17,715
-All right?
-Yeah.

334
00:27:31,002 --> 00:27:32,299
Last one.

335
00:27:34,472 --> 00:27:35,871
Okay, get them.

336
00:27:36,774 --> 00:27:39,299
That stuff's filthy. I could get her infection.

337
00:27:39,377 --> 00:27:41,868
Take it, man. Do it, now. Take it.

338
00:27:52,590 --> 00:27:55,582
-Wait. Where are you going?
-Don't worry, the room's paid for.

339
00:27:55,660 --> 00:27:58,891
This woman is ill and needs to be
given lV antibiotics immediately...

340
00:27:58,963 --> 00:28:00,988
or she could die.
You're responsible for her.

341
00:28:01,065 --> 00:28:03,124
Not anymore.
You guys can keep the girl, man.

342
00:28:03,201 --> 00:28:05,533
Like, you know, consider her a tip.

343
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:37,866
I know why you asked me here, Julia.

344
00:28:37,935 --> 00:28:42,031
Okay. And how do you feeI about that?

345
00:28:45,309 --> 00:28:48,574
I feeI you should give
Dr. McNamara another chance.

346
00:28:49,947 --> 00:28:51,881
When I first met you, Julia...

347
00:28:51,949 --> 00:28:56,147
I could sense you needed a girlfriend
to talk to, just like I do sometimes.

348
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:59,485
Sophia, how do you know
about my problems with Sean?

349
00:28:59,557 --> 00:29:01,650
Because I'm friends with Liz.

350
00:29:02,827 --> 00:29:06,160
Dr. McNamara loves you, Julia.

351
00:29:07,298 --> 00:29:10,461
The way he talks about you so admiringly.

352
00:29:11,502 --> 00:29:13,629
He thinks you hung the moon.

353
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:17,671
I'm sorry.

354
00:29:18,309 --> 00:29:21,369
It's okay, sweetie. Let it out.

355
00:29:23,081 --> 00:29:24,070
No.

356
00:29:24,916 --> 00:29:26,543
It's just that...

357
00:29:28,953 --> 00:29:31,183
I'm so angry with him.

358
00:29:32,590 --> 00:29:35,787
I know. It must feel
like unbearable pain, Julia.

359
00:29:35,927 --> 00:29:38,953
I recognize that. But he's a man...

360
00:29:39,864 --> 00:29:41,855
the most flawed of species.

361
00:29:42,767 --> 00:29:44,029
But, Julia...

362
00:29:45,002 --> 00:29:48,961
look at all of Dr. McNamara's
positive attributes.

363
00:29:52,043 --> 00:29:53,772
Actually, Sophia...

364
00:29:54,912 --> 00:29:57,574
I think he's the one that wants to leave.

365
00:29:58,416 --> 00:30:03,012
He's been almost unrecognizable lately.

366
00:30:06,557 --> 00:30:08,422
Marriage is hard, Julia.

367
00:30:09,227 --> 00:30:11,991
I know. I've been there, and I failed.

368
00:30:13,798 --> 00:30:15,561
When I was a man.

369
00:30:17,268 --> 00:30:18,428
Right.

370
00:30:27,345 --> 00:30:29,074
ls there a problem?

371
00:30:31,115 --> 00:30:32,844
Don't worry, Julia.

372
00:30:32,917 --> 00:30:37,081
lf I let those people bother me,
l'd have slit my wrists years ago.

373
00:30:37,255 --> 00:30:39,246
Well, actually, Sophia...

374
00:30:42,126 --> 00:30:45,459
as well as talking about my marriage...

375
00:30:46,063 --> 00:30:51,023
I also came here because of the women
in our Pilates class. They're....

376
00:30:52,036 --> 00:30:53,697
Curious about me.

377
00:30:55,706 --> 00:30:58,470
They don't want you in the class, Sophia.

378
00:31:05,383 --> 00:31:06,509
But I do.

379
00:31:16,828 --> 00:31:19,558
You're responding well to the Augmentin.

380
00:31:19,897 --> 00:31:23,196
The infection looks like it's subsiding,
Ms. Ramos.

381
00:31:23,267 --> 00:31:26,031
It's true what they say about the States.

382
00:31:28,539 --> 00:31:30,439
Things are better here.

383
00:31:31,609 --> 00:31:34,305
People are better here.

384
00:31:38,749 --> 00:31:42,276
When will I be well enough to travel
to Fort Lauderdale?

385
00:31:44,488 --> 00:31:46,456
I need to meet my agent.

386
00:31:48,059 --> 00:31:50,493
I'm going to be a model, you know.

387
00:32:01,939 --> 00:32:04,669
There is no modeling agency, sweetheart.

388
00:32:07,879 --> 00:32:11,542
We took the information you gave us
to check out the agency.

389
00:32:12,516 --> 00:32:15,110
It's nothing but a post office box...

390
00:32:15,486 --> 00:32:17,249
and an answering service.

391
00:32:18,689 --> 00:32:21,180
You were lied to. About everything.

392
00:32:25,396 --> 00:32:27,489
I don't understand.

393
00:32:28,199 --> 00:32:31,635
There is no work permit
waiting for you here, Antonia.

394
00:32:31,903 --> 00:32:35,532
You're gonna have to leave
once your tourist visa expires.

395
00:32:37,441 --> 00:32:38,601
Leave?

396
00:32:41,779 --> 00:32:44,612
But my family is counting on me.

397
00:32:46,083 --> 00:32:47,675
I can't go back.

398
00:32:48,753 --> 00:32:50,345
They need money.

399
00:32:51,989 --> 00:32:55,982
Please, isn't there something you can do?

400
00:32:57,662 --> 00:33:01,393
We can help you heal, Antonia,
but we can't change the laws.

401
00:33:29,694 --> 00:33:32,288
Hi, Suzanne. You remember Sophia.

402
00:33:32,663 --> 00:33:36,064
Hello, Suzanne.
Don't you just love this class?

403
00:33:36,467 --> 00:33:38,162
It's so harmonious.

404
00:33:39,503 --> 00:33:42,529
Julia, may I have a word with you outside?

405
00:33:43,674 --> 00:33:45,039
That's all right, Suzanne.

406
00:33:45,109 --> 00:33:48,567
Anything you want to say to me,
you can say in front of my friend.

407
00:33:48,646 --> 00:33:50,773
ls there a problem, Suzanne?

408
00:33:52,350 --> 00:33:55,285
No, Sophia. No problem at all.

409
00:34:15,339 --> 00:34:16,931
Can we begin?

410
00:34:18,175 --> 00:34:21,906
I'm sorry. I can't teach a class
with only two people in it.

411
00:34:22,613 --> 00:34:26,049
I've got a 3-person minimum. Sorry.

412
00:34:35,426 --> 00:34:38,862
Yeah, this is good stuff.
Pricey, but worth it.

413
00:34:38,996 --> 00:34:41,988
You live in a high-rise building
with a balcony, got rug rats...

414
00:34:42,066 --> 00:34:43,533
this stuff is a necessity.

415
00:34:43,601 --> 00:34:45,296
What about if you live on a houseboat?

416
00:34:45,369 --> 00:34:47,837
You could block a deck off with it, too.

417
00:34:47,938 --> 00:34:51,999
Actually, I recommend doing that.
She likes to keep the portholes open.

418
00:34:52,443 --> 00:34:54,707
Who? Gina? How would you know?

419
00:34:54,979 --> 00:34:58,847
<i>I delivered some stuff to her yesterday
on the good ship Lollipop.</i>

420
00:34:59,450 --> 00:35:03,011
You're one lucky dude.
Some women just take to pregnancy.

421
00:35:05,222 --> 00:35:08,988
Like I told you, Brad,
pregnant women are not my thing.

422
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:12,120
I've done way too many
post-delivery tummy tucks.

423
00:35:12,196 --> 00:35:15,563
You're missing the boat, Doc.
Pun intended.

424
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:19,959
Pregnancy does wonders for
a woman's sex drive. They're insatiable.

425
00:35:20,571 --> 00:35:23,438
You want to know the best time?
39 weeks.

426
00:35:23,641 --> 00:35:25,734
-Why is that, Brad?
-Two reasons.

427
00:35:25,810 --> 00:35:28,973
First, you get to come inside them,
and chemicals in the semen...

428
00:35:29,046 --> 00:35:32,812
help dilate the cervix and bring on labor.
They're desperate for it.

429
00:35:32,883 --> 00:35:35,943
Second, they start expelling breast milk.

430
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:39,251
You ever taste
the nectar of the gods? Sweet!

431
00:35:39,323 --> 00:35:44,124
Why don't we just order 50 yards
of fencing, and call it a day?

432
00:35:44,295 --> 00:35:46,058
Okay, buddy, but take my word for it.

433
00:35:46,130 --> 00:35:49,258
You liked Gina before she conceived,
you're gonna love her now.

434
00:35:49,333 --> 00:35:50,925
She's a tigress.

435
00:35:52,670 --> 00:35:54,331
Did you screw her?

436
00:35:54,405 --> 00:35:58,808
Well, yeah. She told me about you
guys' situation. I thought we were cool.

437
00:35:59,810 --> 00:36:03,302
You're bragging to me about banging
the mother of my unborn child...

438
00:36:03,380 --> 00:36:06,872
and you think I'm cooI with that?
What kind of sick fetish freak are you?

439
00:36:06,951 --> 00:36:08,714
She told me you weren't together.

440
00:36:08,786 --> 00:36:11,380
What's the difference?
That's my child you're poking at!

441
00:36:11,455 --> 00:36:13,719
I didn't mean to. I swear.

442
00:36:13,791 --> 00:36:18,057
She was just so lonely and beautiful.
You can't see it, but I can!

443
00:36:19,330 --> 00:36:22,697
CanceI my order! Stay away from my kid!

444
00:36:41,085 --> 00:36:42,518
Can we talk?

445
00:36:43,487 --> 00:36:44,613
Sure.

446
00:36:46,557 --> 00:36:47,819
I'm sorry...

447
00:36:48,626 --> 00:36:50,992
for yelling at you yesterday.

448
00:36:51,428 --> 00:36:54,989
Your dad and I are going through
a rough patch. I'm sure it won't--

449
00:36:55,065 --> 00:36:56,396
No, Mom...

450
00:36:56,934 --> 00:37:00,370
I think you're right about Dad.
Something is going on.

451
00:37:00,804 --> 00:37:01,998
Why do you say that?

452
00:37:02,072 --> 00:37:04,939
Because he wrote me a check
to buy some schooI stuff...

453
00:37:05,009 --> 00:37:08,672
and they wouldn't cash it.
The bookstore said it was overdrawn.

454
00:37:15,953 --> 00:37:18,854
Annie, honey, come over here, please.

455
00:37:20,391 --> 00:37:22,552
Go ahead, sweetie. Go to your mommy.

456
00:37:24,361 --> 00:37:27,353
-Who the hell are you?
-Get out of our house.

457
00:37:27,965 --> 00:37:31,264
No need for alarm, guys.
I'm a business associate of Sean's.

458
00:37:31,335 --> 00:37:32,927
I was in the neighborhood, and l--

459
00:37:33,003 --> 00:37:35,870
Get out of my house,
or I'm calling the police.

460
00:37:41,245 --> 00:37:42,735
Lovely house.

461
00:37:57,494 --> 00:38:00,395
That's delicious. What is that?
That's organic?

462
00:38:03,167 --> 00:38:04,566
Tell Sean...

463
00:38:05,336 --> 00:38:07,099
that I stopped by...

464
00:38:07,271 --> 00:38:11,173
and I met his beautifuI family.

465
00:38:12,943 --> 00:38:14,410
Bye, pumpkin.

466
00:38:42,406 --> 00:38:43,532
How many?

467
00:38:43,607 --> 00:38:46,201
lf you want me to quit,
prescribe some Wellbutrin.

468
00:38:46,277 --> 00:38:47,938
Not cigarettes, you dumb slut.

469
00:38:48,012 --> 00:38:51,209
How many dicks have you had
since you became pregnant with my baby?

470
00:38:51,282 --> 00:38:55,309
Just because I have your asshole DNA
inside me, doesn't mean you own me.

471
00:39:02,426 --> 00:39:05,884
When are you gonna realize
this isn't about me and you?

472
00:39:06,930 --> 00:39:08,420
You're carrying a baby.

473
00:39:08,499 --> 00:39:11,730
There's more than one life
depending on the well-being of your body.

474
00:39:11,802 --> 00:39:14,930
You can't just let some sicko
stick his dick inside you right now.

475
00:39:15,005 --> 00:39:17,132
Are you questioning my love for this baby?

476
00:39:17,207 --> 00:39:20,699
Along with the love you apparently
don't have for yourself, yes.

477
00:39:26,317 --> 00:39:27,614
Jesus.

478
00:39:30,921 --> 00:39:32,081
Why are you crying?

479
00:39:32,156 --> 00:39:36,149
I'm crying because I'm 35 years old,
I'm pregnant, and I'm alone!

480
00:39:37,127 --> 00:39:38,856
And I just slept with some pervert...

481
00:39:38,929 --> 00:39:42,126
who wanted to lick my stomach
while I went down on him.

482
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:44,800
I can't believe you had sex with that guy.

483
00:39:44,868 --> 00:39:47,769
It wasn't about sex, Christian.
It was about....

484
00:39:51,241 --> 00:39:53,141
It was about reassurance.

485
00:39:56,280 --> 00:40:00,216
For just half an hour
I feIt like I wasn't alone in this.

486
00:40:04,655 --> 00:40:06,555
I love this baby so much.

487
00:40:07,558 --> 00:40:10,493
And I know this is probably
my last chance to feeI whole...

488
00:40:10,561 --> 00:40:13,223
to have a purpose, but I cannot do it.

489
00:40:15,466 --> 00:40:17,093
I'm not equipped.

490
00:40:17,534 --> 00:40:19,661
I can't take care of a baby.

491
00:40:23,073 --> 00:40:24,836
What was I thinking?

492
00:40:29,046 --> 00:40:31,344
You can do this, Gina. You just...

493
00:40:32,750 --> 00:40:34,445
can't do it alone.

494
00:40:45,462 --> 00:40:47,089
Pack your things.

495
00:41:06,183 --> 00:41:08,743
Sean, just give me a second here, man.

496
00:41:12,289 --> 00:41:15,781
lf you even look at my family again,
I'll kill you! You understand?

497
00:41:15,859 --> 00:41:17,918
<i>-I will kill you.
-Puto.</i>

498
00:41:25,335 --> 00:41:27,030
Let me cap him, boss.

499
00:41:27,104 --> 00:41:30,938
No. We can't shoot him.
He's the talented one. Get up.

500
00:41:34,211 --> 00:41:35,678
Sit him down.

501
00:41:38,782 --> 00:41:42,980
That was brave, coming into my house,
roughing up my shit.

502
00:41:43,086 --> 00:41:45,281
You're not the pussy I thought you were.

503
00:41:45,355 --> 00:41:47,619
-Escobar.
-What?

504
00:41:48,759 --> 00:41:49,987
We done?

505
00:41:50,661 --> 00:41:52,151
Did I finish?

506
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:57,890
Where were we?

507
00:41:57,968 --> 00:42:00,163
Why did you threaten my family?

508
00:42:00,237 --> 00:42:02,705
I have done everything
you asked me to do.

509
00:42:02,773 --> 00:42:06,903
Yeah, this is true, Sean.
But I'm going to be asking you to do more.

510
00:42:07,177 --> 00:42:11,341
And frankly, I need to get
the resistance thing out of the way.

511
00:42:11,415 --> 00:42:14,441
And now that you know
that I know where you live...

512
00:42:14,518 --> 00:42:16,452
there won't be any resistance, will there?

513
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:21,082
You continue to work on my clients,
and I'll let your family live in peace.

514
00:42:26,930 --> 00:42:29,091
I want you to watch something.

515
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:31,892
<i>Turn around, mami.</i>

516
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:40,267
Now you watch this, okay,
and you realize...

517
00:42:40,978 --> 00:42:42,809
that if I wanted it...

518
00:42:44,982 --> 00:42:46,677
this could be your wife.

519
00:43:02,165 --> 00:43:03,894
What are you doing?

520
00:43:04,468 --> 00:43:06,868
What does it look like I'm doing?

521
00:43:07,504 --> 00:43:10,200
I don't want you sleeping on the couch.

522
00:43:13,010 --> 00:43:14,875
How about the balcony?

523
00:43:15,012 --> 00:43:17,742
At least I can smoke in peace out there.

524
00:43:20,551 --> 00:43:22,416
You can sleep with me.

525
00:43:25,589 --> 00:43:28,251
You're an expectant mother.
You need the back support.

526
00:43:28,325 --> 00:43:30,259
But no monkey business.

527
00:43:49,513 --> 00:43:52,607
-Better not snore, asshole.
-Right back at you.

528
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:57,880
What?

529
00:43:58,388 --> 00:44:00,117
I just feIt the baby.

530
00:44:01,291 --> 00:44:02,815
It's kicking.

531
00:44:06,964 --> 00:44:08,226
Really?

532
00:44:11,969 --> 00:44:13,596
What's it feeI like?

533
00:44:33,590 --> 00:44:36,150
We've got a heavyweight champion
in there.

534
00:44:38,095 --> 00:44:41,394
-He's a feisty little guy, isn't he?
-Or a girl.

535
00:44:48,238 --> 00:44:49,603
It's Russo.

536
00:44:52,576 --> 00:44:53,668
What?

537
00:44:55,212 --> 00:44:56,736
My last name.

538
00:44:59,216 --> 00:45:00,547
It's Russo.

539
00:45:37,187 --> 00:45:38,814
Our 2:00 is here.

540
00:45:56,406 --> 00:46:00,035
Miss Gutierrez, tell us
what you don't like about yourself.

541
00:46:00,377 --> 00:46:01,742
My breasts.

542
00:46:37,013 --> 00:46:38,002
