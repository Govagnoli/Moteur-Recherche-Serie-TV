1
00:00:16,394 --> 00:00:18,102
Previously on Nip/Tuck...

2
00:00:18,113 --> 00:00:21,838
The hotel De La Mer was Miami's most exclusive spot in the twenties.

3
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:24,122
I'll be your partner, 50-50.

4
00:00:24,593 --> 00:00:27,911
We'll transform it into a surgical recovery spa.

5
00:00:27,963 --> 00:00:30,896
I'm sorry, Sean, but I have taken another job.

6
00:00:31,178 --> 00:00:31,956
Where?

7
00:00:32,105 --> 00:00:33,410
Julia's spa.

8
00:00:36,945 --> 00:00:38,116
What are you doing?

9
00:00:38,159 --> 00:00:40,113
I'm sorry, Chritian. I can't do this anymore.

10
00:00:40,127 --> 00:00:41,163
We can talk about it tomorrow.

11
00:00:41,224 --> 00:00:42,923
There's not gonna be a tomorrow for us.

12
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:46,902
Quentin is an excellent surgeon. I'm sure you two will get along just fine.

13
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:53,020
Mr. White, tell me what you don't like about yourself.

14
00:00:54,449 --> 00:00:58,098
Uh, I can't look at myself in the mirror.

15
00:00:59,097 --> 00:01:01,379
It's, uh... it's too painful.

16
00:01:02,313 --> 00:01:05,283
Mr. White, I'm not exactly sure what we can do for you.

17
00:01:06,045 --> 00:01:10,669
I have a condition called B.I.I.D.-- Body integrity identity disorder.

18
00:01:10,699 --> 00:01:13,823
No matter how many psychiatrists I've seen or medications I've taken,

19
00:01:13,885 --> 00:01:16,280
I can't stop obsessing about my leg.

20
00:01:16,618 --> 00:01:20,375
Well, you've, uh... you've suffered a big loss. It's very natural--

21
00:01:20,422 --> 00:01:23,692
No, no, no, no, no. You don't understand. Uh...

22
00:01:24,601 --> 00:01:28,133
Mr. White, please, keep your pants on. We don't do prosthetics.

23
00:01:28,185 --> 00:01:31,784
I don't want one. I just want my body to reflect who I am inside.

24
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:47,589
I want you to remove my leg.

25
00:01:53,882 --> 00:01:58,203
Ever since I was 5 or 6, I've felt I had this extra appendage.

26
00:01:58,264 --> 00:02:00,875
I used to ask god to make this awful feeling go away.

27
00:02:00,933 --> 00:02:05,612
It didn't. I turned 40 last week, and now I have a different prayer.

28
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:09,109
If there is a god, I just want him to lead me to a doctor

29
00:02:09,305 --> 00:02:13,328
who will help me end this agony.

30
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:14,731
We don't do amputations.

31
00:02:14,777 --> 00:02:17,066
You have built your practice on body modification,

32
00:02:17,112 --> 00:02:19,989
and I am no different than somebody who'd come to you for a sex change.

33
00:02:20,036 --> 00:02:20,860
Would you turn him away?

34
00:02:20,926 --> 00:02:23,737
No, but we would be helping him, not maiming him.

35
00:02:26,481 --> 00:02:27,756
My friend Eric...

36
00:02:28,596 --> 00:02:30,183
I met him in a support group.

37
00:02:31,141 --> 00:02:36,347
He'd finally found a doctor willing to perform the surgery in Mexico-- a Dr. Carrion.

38
00:02:37,459 --> 00:02:41,565
So I loaned him the $10,000, I drove him to the airport. He was so happy.

39
00:02:42,486 --> 00:02:44,386
He'd finally be free.

40
00:02:46,246 --> 00:02:49,445
They found him in a garage with both of his legs cut off.

41
00:02:49,461 --> 00:02:51,555
He died of gangrene and infection.

42
00:02:51,606 --> 00:02:54,513
It turns out Dr. Carrion never had a license.

43
00:02:55,016 --> 00:03:01,261
Mr. White, no licensed physician will take off a healthy limb just because "it isn't you."

44
00:03:01,297 --> 00:03:03,519
Don't talk to me like I'm insane, Dr. Troy.

45
00:03:03,627 --> 00:03:06,315
I am a successful architect.

46
00:03:06,986 --> 00:03:10,903
I didn't ask for this condition. I was born this way. I had no choice in the matter.

47
00:03:10,964 --> 00:03:14,057
What about your family? Are they in favor of this?

48
00:03:14,123 --> 00:03:18,153
My wife, she, uh, took my son and left almost a year ago.

49
00:03:19,694 --> 00:03:20,830
Mr. White,

50
00:03:22,574 --> 00:03:26,892
a procedure like this, it wouldn't exactly be covered by your HMO.

51
00:03:26,953 --> 00:03:29,258
Money is not an object.

52
00:03:30,579 --> 00:03:35,192
I'm not asking for favors, just control over my own body.

53
00:03:37,235 --> 00:03:39,852
There are thousands of people like us all over the world

54
00:03:40,154 --> 00:03:44,920
who are willing to lose everything, our families, our friends, our lives,

55
00:03:45,351 --> 00:03:49,231
to be at peace and to finally feel whole.

56
00:04:42,936 --> 00:04:46,084
So I guess you're just going to dismiss this case.

57
00:04:46,448 --> 00:04:47,344
Watch me.

58
00:04:48,138 --> 00:04:49,248
Case dismissed.

59
00:04:49,981 --> 00:04:51,926
It is a little inconsistent, though, isn't it?

60
00:04:52,002 --> 00:04:56,545
I mean, we correct a lot of imagined flaws to alleviate psychological pain.

61
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:59,084
That's exactly what Mr. White's asking us to do.

62
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:02,438
And once he's lost his leg and he goes hopping down the loony trail,

63
00:05:02,499 --> 00:05:06,816
he'll realize that his amputation solved nothing.

64
00:05:07,486 --> 00:05:09,719
Well, I'm not saying we should do it.

65
00:05:09,743 --> 00:05:14,290
I'm just saying that maybe you should do a little research before you turn into Sean.

66
00:05:17,073 --> 00:05:18,813
And what's that supposed to mean?

67
00:05:19,248 --> 00:05:21,470
You always talk about Sean's moral posturing.

68
00:05:21,664 --> 00:05:23,276
Well, he's gone now,

69
00:05:23,405 --> 00:05:25,806
and you need to start thinking outside the box.

70
00:05:25,893 --> 00:05:27,655
You want to be cutting-edge, right?

71
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,560
Who's stopping you?

72
00:05:38,693 --> 00:05:40,598
You're certainly highly qualified.

73
00:05:42,257 --> 00:05:47,838
Damn. The money I could make as a civilian surgeon lifting saggy tits and asses.

74
00:05:48,518 --> 00:05:53,869
Tell me, Dr. McNamara, why would a rich, liberal plastic surgeon want to assist the FBI?

75
00:05:53,936 --> 00:05:57,037
It's just my work started to lose its meaning.

76
00:05:57,146 --> 00:06:00,315
I spoke to Dr. Grotten at the American board of plastic surgery.

77
00:06:00,376 --> 00:06:01,815
We were friends in medical school,

78
00:06:01,838 --> 00:06:04,713
and I told him I was looking for something with more purpose.

79
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:08,226
Want to get back in touch with the reason I became a physician in the first place.

80
00:06:08,298 --> 00:06:09,531
He told me about your program.

81
00:06:09,603 --> 00:06:11,897
6 figures isn't doing it for you anymore?

82
00:06:11,973 --> 00:06:13,570
I want to be of service.

83
00:06:15,855 --> 00:06:19,929
I left my practice, my wife, my son and daughter.

84
00:06:20,284 --> 00:06:23,110
I always thought I'd die without them, but I didn't.

85
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:24,518
I'm alive.

86
00:06:25,213 --> 00:06:27,195
Alive with nothing to live for.

87
00:06:27,257 --> 00:06:30,579
Could you speak up? It's hard to hear through all those violins.

88
00:06:30,647 --> 00:06:32,270
Listen, if you don't want my services--

89
00:06:32,331 --> 00:06:34,158
I didn't say that, but I do want you to know

90
00:06:34,203 --> 00:06:38,337
what you'd be getting yourself into were I to accept your services.

91
00:06:39,058 --> 00:06:43,334
Working as a surgeon in the witness protection program requires total secrecy.

92
00:06:43,395 --> 00:06:44,353
That's not a problem.

93
00:06:44,444 --> 00:06:47,686
And there's not a lot of warm and fuzzies, if that's what you're looking for.

94
00:06:47,754 --> 00:06:50,108
There is no doctor-patient relationship.

95
00:06:50,774 --> 00:06:54,941
Once you've altered their appearance, all contact ends.

96
00:06:54,996 --> 00:06:57,516
You will not be told their new names or their whereabouts.

97
00:06:57,572 --> 00:06:59,815
- It's the work I'm--
- Let me finish.

98
00:07:00,926 --> 00:07:05,508
Lives are at stake. It's not about your mid-life crisis.

99
00:07:05,575 --> 00:07:07,853
There's no room for emotion or debate.

100
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:11,525
And it's my call as to whether your shit's together enough to accept that.

101
00:07:11,591 --> 00:07:15,897
So... is your shit together, Dr. McNamara?

102
00:07:17,453 --> 00:07:18,944
No, it's not.

103
00:07:19,568 --> 00:07:21,994
My shit is definitely not together.

104
00:07:22,245 --> 00:07:23,203
Good.

105
00:07:24,115 --> 00:07:26,792
Then you won't have any trouble taking orders from me.

106
00:07:28,123 --> 00:07:30,565
Your first consult's waiting in the garden--

107
00:07:31,181 --> 00:07:32,635
Nicole morretti.

108
00:07:35,671 --> 00:07:36,797
She's very pretty.

109
00:07:38,308 --> 00:07:41,953
It's not about changing looks. It's about saving a life.

110
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:46,171
I'll be working alongside you to preserve the resemblance between the mother and son.

111
00:07:46,648 --> 00:07:47,785
Son?

112
00:08:02,444 --> 00:08:03,759
Nicole Morretti?

113
00:08:04,568 --> 00:08:05,352
Oh...

114
00:08:06,124 --> 00:08:08,741
I'm Dr. McNamara. I'll be doing your surgery.

115
00:08:09,268 --> 00:08:10,451
I'm sorry, Ms. Morretti.

116
00:08:10,462 --> 00:08:14,635
I guess sneaking up on someone about to enter the witness protection program--

117
00:08:14,645 --> 00:08:18,362
It's ok. You're a doctor. At least you know how to restart a heart.

118
00:08:19,672 --> 00:08:21,090
Please call me Nikki.

119
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:30,882
My husband Vic was a member of the Cardoni family.

120
00:08:31,029 --> 00:08:33,250
In the beginning, I pretended not to know.

121
00:08:33,814 --> 00:08:36,062
All I knew was that we belonged together.

122
00:08:37,111 --> 00:08:39,456
Don't get to pick whom you fall in love with, do you?

123
00:08:39,553 --> 00:08:40,864
No, you don't.

124
00:08:42,969 --> 00:08:45,038
The FBI saw me as a mark.

125
00:08:45,903 --> 00:08:48,815
They said if I gave them information, we would all have immunity.

126
00:08:48,871 --> 00:08:51,770
They would help us move, start over.

127
00:08:52,891 --> 00:08:55,051
But Cardoni didn't give immunity.

128
00:08:55,211 --> 00:09:00,530
On the afternoon of our son's birthday-- he had just turned 12--

129
00:09:01,681 --> 00:09:03,603
Vic was coming home early.

130
00:09:04,943 --> 00:09:09,106
They shot him, coming out of a sporting goods store.

131
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:12,674
He would still be alive today if it weren't for me.

132
00:09:13,525 --> 00:09:16,014
And now look at all this we gotta go through.

133
00:09:17,765 --> 00:09:20,002
You'll be fine, I promise.

134
00:09:20,078 --> 00:09:21,798
The procedure will be minimal,

135
00:09:22,065 --> 00:09:26,095
enough to be effective without being too radical.

136
00:09:28,629 --> 00:09:31,963
A narrowing of your nose, cheek implants,

137
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:35,914
possibly minor liposuction in the lower jaw region.

138
00:09:36,089 --> 00:09:39,351
A change in hair color, tinted contact lenses...

139
00:09:39,437 --> 00:09:42,935
sometimes minor adjustments are all that's needed to change your appearance.

140
00:09:43,851 --> 00:09:45,592
What about austin?

141
00:09:46,324 --> 00:09:49,252
Have you ever done something like this to a boy his age?

142
00:09:49,555 --> 00:09:51,377
A good surgeon always takes into account

143
00:09:51,428 --> 00:09:55,858
how the young person's bone structure will develop and change.

144
00:09:56,523 --> 00:09:58,755
And I'm a good surgeon, Ms. Morretti.

145
00:10:03,891 --> 00:10:07,891
Well, perhaps you'd like to reserve a space at another time?

146
00:10:10,317 --> 00:10:15,041
No, I understand, although being new does have its advantages.

147
00:10:15,539 --> 00:10:20,383
No, we're not listed in that publication yet, but once we're reviewed, I'm sure it'll be--

148
00:10:21,744 --> 00:10:23,107
Absolutely.

149
00:10:23,259 --> 00:10:24,592
We'll still be here.

150
00:10:26,676 --> 00:10:28,487
It's a vicious circle.

151
00:10:28,565 --> 00:10:30,777
People won't come because no one knows about us,

152
00:10:30,828 --> 00:10:33,398
and no one knows about us because no one comes.

153
00:10:33,465 --> 00:10:38,964
Well, Ms. Carr seems very happy and very well-connected.

154
00:10:39,619 --> 00:10:41,646
I'll bring her some flowers.

155
00:10:42,046 --> 00:10:46,540
I don't want our only client happy. I want her ecstatic.

156
00:10:50,832 --> 00:10:53,535
Good morning. I brought you some fresh flowers.

157
00:10:53,591 --> 00:10:56,888
A little pampering speeds up the recovery process.

158
00:10:57,006 --> 00:11:01,093
If there's anything else I can get you-- some fresh cucumber water or...

159
00:11:01,159 --> 00:11:07,251
Honey, please. It's gonna be hard enough adjustin' to reality after a week in this paradise.

160
00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:11,584
Well, we're still new, so if you can help spread the word.

161
00:11:11,650 --> 00:11:14,358
Oh, like wildfire, darlin'.

162
00:11:14,408 --> 00:11:17,542
A lot of us out-of-state girls come to Florida for a quickie

163
00:11:17,588 --> 00:11:19,755
and have no idea where to go afterwards.

164
00:11:19,831 --> 00:11:22,095
I just thank the lord he sent me to the gym that mornin'

165
00:11:22,141 --> 00:11:25,177
and then guided me to the elliptical machine next to Liz.

166
00:11:25,228 --> 00:11:28,731
Within 5 minutes, she knew I was gay, and I knew she was having lipo.

167
00:11:28,785 --> 00:11:32,118
There are no secrets when you're jiggling up an electronic mountain.

168
00:11:32,514 --> 00:11:35,177
The office toilet is overflowing.

169
00:11:35,242 --> 00:11:38,054
Either one of you took a big dump or some homeless bitch...

170
00:11:40,832 --> 00:11:43,742
Oh. I'm sorry.

171
00:11:44,130 --> 00:11:45,903
I thought you were discharged.

172
00:11:45,964 --> 00:11:50,679
Don't worry. I have two boys. I've been uncloggin' toilets for 17 years.

173
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:52,405
You don't have kids that old.

174
00:11:53,010 --> 00:11:55,698
So, what? Did you give birth at 13?

175
00:11:56,194 --> 00:11:57,535
23.

176
00:11:58,396 --> 00:12:00,255
I want the number of your surgeon.

177
00:12:00,316 --> 00:12:04,095
Oh, he hasn't touched my face... yet. I just had a little lipo.

178
00:12:04,156 --> 00:12:07,807
See? It's all a matter of diet--vegetables, 8 glasses of water a day.

179
00:12:07,874 --> 00:12:11,294
I put semen on my face every night before I go to bed.

180
00:12:12,783 --> 00:12:15,333
And I was worried about saying "shit."

181
00:12:15,938 --> 00:12:19,404
Before the divorce, my husband used to like to...

182
00:12:20,142 --> 00:12:23,301
spray his seed all over my face.

183
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:25,507
Didn't do a thing for me sexually,

184
00:12:25,564 --> 00:12:29,746
but I did notice how much better my skin looked afterwards.

185
00:12:29,808 --> 00:12:34,748
Well, I checked, and it turns out that sperm is chock full of all these wonderful things--

186
00:12:34,795 --> 00:12:38,466
amino acids, proteins, vitamin C.

187
00:12:38,518 --> 00:12:40,842
What do you do about supply now that your husband's not around?

188
00:12:40,882 --> 00:12:44,017
Oh, that's not a problem. I get all I need from my sons.

189
00:12:44,088 --> 00:12:48,880
Your sons? You put your sons' semen on your face?

190
00:12:48,965 --> 00:12:53,238
Well, it's not like I stand over them and watch.

191
00:12:53,304 --> 00:12:58,366
I give them these little amber bottles, they fill them up, and put them on my night table.

192
00:12:59,129 --> 00:13:03,841
Well, it's the least they can do. It's not like I'm asking them to unload the dishwasher.

193
00:13:04,664 --> 00:13:07,144
No one here could accuse me of being a prude, right?

194
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:08,511
No one anywhere.

195
00:13:08,566 --> 00:13:12,211
But taking your sons' spooge and putting it on your face?

196
00:13:12,925 --> 00:13:18,417
Well, scientifically speaking, Mrs. Carr is simply using an all-natural, fresh-cell,

197
00:13:18,468 --> 00:13:23,291
hormone-rich substance uncontaminated by cancer-causing preservatives.

198
00:13:23,431 --> 00:13:25,515
It sounds like you're making a sales pitch.

199
00:13:25,586 --> 00:13:28,405
You're not makin' a sales pitch... are you?

200
00:13:28,544 --> 00:13:32,369
No! No, of course not. It's totally disgusting.

201
00:13:32,816 --> 00:13:35,662
I'm just saying that, from a business perspective,

202
00:13:35,705 --> 00:13:39,087
it's effective, it's healthy, it's cheap to produce.

203
00:13:39,216 --> 00:13:42,763
Sperm banks throw away tons of unused donations,

204
00:13:43,014 --> 00:13:47,351
and semen's an anti-depressant. It has mood-altering hormones in it.

205
00:13:47,413 --> 00:13:48,467
I read about it.

206
00:13:48,529 --> 00:13:49,897
Didn't do a thing for me.

207
00:13:49,963 --> 00:13:51,120
That's unbelievable.

208
00:13:51,171 --> 00:13:54,989
My entire life I thought there was a psychological reason why I'm a sex addict.

209
00:13:55,046 --> 00:13:57,362
Turns out I was just jonesing for jizz.

210
00:13:57,729 --> 00:14:00,012
We are so sitting on a gold mine here.

211
00:14:00,064 --> 00:14:02,890
We are not going to bottle semen.

212
00:14:02,947 --> 00:14:05,527
Look, we need a signature product,

213
00:14:05,578 --> 00:14:09,116
something that makes us distinctive, gets people to notice us.

214
00:14:09,162 --> 00:14:12,763
I mean, if we can't make a name for ourselves, they're gonna foreclose this place, ok?

215
00:14:12,803 --> 00:14:16,119
And then Sean and Chritian will say they knew all along that we'd screw it up--

216
00:14:16,172 --> 00:14:20,263
that I would screw it up because I don't have what it takes to be a success,

217
00:14:20,309 --> 00:14:23,089
and I can't let them be right about that.

218
00:14:23,572 --> 00:14:24,851
Neither can you.

219
00:14:41,762 --> 00:14:44,567
Dr. Troy. Thank you for coming.

220
00:14:46,165 --> 00:14:49,282
I was thrilled when you called and agreed to see me again.

221
00:14:49,397 --> 00:14:54,055
I just thought by coming here, you'd see I'm not some, uh, crazy homeless man.

222
00:14:54,162 --> 00:14:56,631
I know it's a bizarre request.

223
00:14:57,322 --> 00:14:59,759
"The american architecture award."

224
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:02,899
That's impressive.

225
00:15:03,093 --> 00:15:07,357
I got it for an atrium house I designed in, uh, 2001.

226
00:15:08,353 --> 00:15:13,854
I utilized the power of negative space, the beauty of what's missing.

227
00:15:18,647 --> 00:15:20,638
That was the last thing I designed.

228
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:28,595
So... what does this have to do with your cutting off your leg?

229
00:15:28,631 --> 00:15:31,968
My obsession has gotten so bad lately, it's all I can think of.

230
00:15:32,255 --> 00:15:33,567
Nothing else matters.

231
00:15:34,094 --> 00:15:36,613
Depression has a dulling effect.

232
00:15:37,524 --> 00:15:39,296
When you implied that you still might do it--

233
00:15:39,352 --> 00:15:40,264
Might.

234
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:44,922
I took an oath as a physician.

235
00:15:45,188 --> 00:15:47,530
First do no harm.

236
00:15:48,425 --> 00:15:50,303
The "hypocritical" oath.

237
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:54,042
The medical profession's unwillingness to help me

238
00:15:54,077 --> 00:15:58,398
and others like me stop the pain is what's really harmful.

239
00:16:00,252 --> 00:16:03,584
That's why I wanted to show you my contingency plan.

240
00:16:14,992 --> 00:16:17,061
Auto-amputation, doctor.

241
00:16:18,689 --> 00:16:21,014
My first attempt at furniture design.

242
00:16:21,081 --> 00:16:24,669
I fill the chest with dry ice. At minus 78 1/2 degrees centigrade,

243
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:28,161
it's cold enough to freeze one's leg off-- quite literally.

244
00:16:28,448 --> 00:16:33,127
In a few hours, I'll be numb and my leg will feel like a block of wood.

245
00:16:33,184 --> 00:16:37,617
A member of my support group, a former nurse, has agreed to assist me.

246
00:16:37,807 --> 00:16:41,176
As plasma starts leaking through the capillary walls,

247
00:16:41,253 --> 00:16:44,112
the skin and tissues begin to freeze.

248
00:16:44,197 --> 00:16:46,793
Necrosis sets in at last.

249
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:51,831
Once the skin is cut, my leg will separate from my body as easily as a boiled chicken leg.

250
00:16:58,401 --> 00:17:01,959
Once it's gone, I'll finally feel whole.

251
00:17:02,026 --> 00:17:03,514
What about the risks?

252
00:17:03,765 --> 00:17:06,422
Sepsis, gangrene, infection?

253
00:17:07,339 --> 00:17:08,757
You might die.

254
00:17:09,229 --> 00:17:10,873
Is that why you wanted me here?

255
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:15,367
I just wanted you to know I'm losing my leg, doctor...

256
00:17:15,838 --> 00:17:17,548
one way or another.

257
00:17:27,311 --> 00:17:29,637
So your mom tells me you're into baseball.

258
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:33,631
I was. Who knows if they even have a team where we're going.

259
00:17:33,784 --> 00:17:36,432
Well, they pretty much play baseball everywhere in the country.

260
00:17:36,478 --> 00:17:38,699
That's why they call it the national pastime.

261
00:17:39,003 --> 00:17:42,954
Any allergies, penicillin, other medications?

262
00:17:43,006 --> 00:17:44,449
No, not a thing.

263
00:17:48,346 --> 00:17:49,487
Is it blocked?

264
00:17:49,565 --> 00:17:50,676
Is what blocked?

265
00:17:50,921 --> 00:17:52,678
My deviated septum.

266
00:17:52,924 --> 00:17:54,881
Dr. Sagamore said it was.

267
00:17:54,941 --> 00:17:57,367
He said I wasn't breathing through my nose enough.

268
00:17:57,931 --> 00:17:59,369
I don't understand.

269
00:18:00,667 --> 00:18:03,962
Well... that's why I'm here, right?

270
00:18:04,592 --> 00:18:06,799
I might have to wear strips at night.

271
00:18:09,292 --> 00:18:10,577
What's wrong?

272
00:18:14,591 --> 00:18:15,667
Austin...

273
00:18:18,355 --> 00:18:21,083
do you know what a plastic surgeon is?

274
00:18:21,658 --> 00:18:24,047
Yes. They change how people look.

275
00:18:24,130 --> 00:18:25,261
That's right.

276
00:18:25,630 --> 00:18:31,554
Well, Dr. Sagamore and Dr. McNamara are both plastic surgeons and--

277
00:18:31,615 --> 00:18:33,904
They're gonna change my face?

278
00:18:35,045 --> 00:18:37,483
No. No, I don't want them to do anything to it.

279
00:18:37,525 --> 00:18:40,208
Just little changes so that we can look different.

280
00:18:40,247 --> 00:18:41,985
I don't want to look different!

281
00:18:42,301 --> 00:18:43,893
I don't want you to look different!

282
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:46,956
I know, sweetie, but we have to do it. This is the only way we can be safe.

283
00:18:47,013 --> 00:18:49,465
- You're a liar!
- Austin. Austin, please.

284
00:18:49,511 --> 00:18:51,502
This is all your fault.

285
00:18:54,527 --> 00:18:57,472
Oh, Dr. Sagamore said not to tell him.

286
00:18:57,523 --> 00:18:58,654
I wish someone had told me.

287
00:18:58,717 --> 00:19:00,979
I should have told him, no matter what Dr. Sagamore said.

288
00:19:01,030 --> 00:19:03,104
I'm his mother. Now there's nobody he can trust.

289
00:19:16,073 --> 00:19:18,873
First the furniture, now the artwork.

290
00:19:19,765 --> 00:19:21,274
It's coming along, don't you think?

291
00:19:22,018 --> 00:19:22,903
Mm.

292
00:19:24,661 --> 00:19:26,865
I went to see Mr. White.

293
00:19:27,255 --> 00:19:28,585
A house call.

294
00:19:28,852 --> 00:19:33,614
Well, when I said research, I meant go online.

295
00:19:33,686 --> 00:19:37,618
I did that, too. B.I.I.D. case studies.

296
00:19:37,668 --> 00:19:41,069
One guy got drunk, laid down on the train tracks,

297
00:19:41,228 --> 00:19:45,299
woke up a double amputee. Somebody else, a guillotine.

298
00:19:45,370 --> 00:19:48,191
Necessity is the mother of invention.

299
00:19:48,277 --> 00:19:53,604
All had the best psychiatric help and meds. Nothing stops the obsession.

300
00:19:53,772 --> 00:19:56,152
Ok, ok, so we go for it.

301
00:19:56,208 --> 00:20:00,233
I mean, it's better they come to us than one of these do-it-yourself methods. Right?

302
00:20:00,289 --> 00:20:03,833
What next? If a guy thinks he's a dog, do we give him a tail?

303
00:20:04,391 --> 00:20:08,799
Look, Chritian, either you're serious about making our practice number one,

304
00:20:08,845 --> 00:20:10,529
or we are not gonna survive.

305
00:20:10,576 --> 00:20:12,799
What's operating on Mr. White got to do with--

306
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:15,553
For starters, he's willing to pay us $100,000.

307
00:20:15,613 --> 00:20:18,450
That's $70,000 over the asking price.

308
00:20:22,992 --> 00:20:24,962
Why didn't you tell me this?

309
00:20:25,286 --> 00:20:27,498
I am telling you. Now.

310
00:20:27,610 --> 00:20:29,633
You got any more renovations planned...

311
00:20:29,808 --> 00:20:32,101
that'll cost some poor schmuck an arm and a leg?

312
00:20:32,163 --> 00:20:35,791
Hey, at least I've paid my dues, doctor.

313
00:20:35,854 --> 00:20:37,778
You've always been in it for the money.

314
00:20:37,831 --> 00:20:41,331
Or were all those tit jobs your way of giving back to the world?

315
00:20:45,751 --> 00:20:48,038
We're not operating on Mr. White.

316
00:20:48,121 --> 00:20:50,400
Well, you better go break the news to him, then.

317
00:20:50,491 --> 00:20:52,611
Because I've already scheduled it.

318
00:21:03,190 --> 00:21:06,968
Maybe we should have waited until the spa had an actual signature

319
00:21:07,025 --> 00:21:09,492
before marketing a signature product.

320
00:21:09,554 --> 00:21:11,137
Maybe if we gave away samples--

321
00:21:11,198 --> 00:21:12,784
Oh, wait a few weeks.

322
00:21:12,841 --> 00:21:14,643
We're gonna get rid of crates of this stuff

323
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:17,254
just as soon as our active ingredient stops swimming.

324
00:21:17,316 --> 00:21:20,486
If you're thinking of becoming a motivational speaker-- don't.

325
00:21:20,553 --> 00:21:22,380
I'm just repeating what my friend told me

326
00:21:22,411 --> 00:21:24,633
when I went to pick the stuff up at the sperm bank.

327
00:21:24,679 --> 00:21:27,909
Success is where preparation and opportunity meet.

328
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:29,594
Oh, please. What do you know about preparation,

329
00:21:29,635 --> 00:21:33,208
miss "I'll design the packaging while you kids mix the yuck with lavender and alcohol."

330
00:21:33,275 --> 00:21:35,708
I'm the only one with marketing experience.

331
00:21:35,759 --> 00:21:38,375
I studied advertising before I went into premed.

332
00:21:38,431 --> 00:21:40,816
Oh, and you've been so successful at both.

333
00:21:40,878 --> 00:21:42,979
You can be a real bitch, you know that?

334
00:21:43,015 --> 00:21:45,497
Excuse me. I'm looking for Julia McNamara?

335
00:21:45,518 --> 00:21:46,665
Uh-huh?

336
00:21:46,732 --> 00:21:48,953
Hi. I'm Joan Rivers.

337
00:21:49,091 --> 00:21:52,469
Yes, of course. I'm a huge fan.

338
00:21:52,552 --> 00:21:54,651
Thank you. But don't think of me as a celebrity.

339
00:21:54,697 --> 00:21:57,990
Think of me as a familiar face that changes every couple of weeks.

340
00:21:58,207 --> 00:22:02,193
I'm here for a procedure, and the tabloids know my usual recovery places,

341
00:22:02,230 --> 00:22:05,045
so I thought I'd check you guys out.

342
00:22:05,915 --> 00:22:08,005
You're thinking about staying here?

343
00:22:08,117 --> 00:22:11,624
Well, my privacy certainly wouldn't be at risk.

344
00:22:13,022 --> 00:22:16,483
Wait a second. McNamara/Troy. Julia McNamara.

345
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:18,372
You must be the doctor's wife, right?

346
00:22:18,571 --> 00:22:20,462
Uh...e-ex.

347
00:22:20,524 --> 00:22:22,473
Oh, well, good for you.

348
00:22:22,529 --> 00:22:24,676
You're certainly putting your alimony to work.

349
00:22:24,901 --> 00:22:26,359
So what was it?

350
00:22:26,472 --> 00:22:28,014
"Change of wife?"

351
00:22:28,034 --> 00:22:31,858
Ha. It was more like a "mid-wife" crisis.

352
00:22:31,930 --> 00:22:34,633
That's very funny. I'm stealing that one.

353
00:22:35,044 --> 00:22:38,602
Ooh! Along with this beautiful guest robe.

354
00:22:38,658 --> 00:22:41,121
Oh, do take it with our compliments.

355
00:22:41,698 --> 00:22:43,600
Thank you very, very much.

356
00:22:43,773 --> 00:22:47,315
I know it sounds pushy, but could I have a book, too?

357
00:22:47,372 --> 00:22:49,072
It's my girlfriend's birthday.

358
00:22:49,118 --> 00:22:50,717
- It's yours.
- Thank you!

359
00:22:51,678 --> 00:22:54,635
Face masks! I love face masks!

360
00:22:54,645 --> 00:22:58,840
Actually, Ms. Rivers, we're only test marketing it right now.

361
00:22:58,897 --> 00:23:00,358
It's not really ready for--

362
00:23:00,414 --> 00:23:03,357
Come on! It's not like it's made of gold.

363
00:23:03,429 --> 00:23:07,067
"All-natural, protein enriched. Lavender."

364
00:23:08,933 --> 00:23:12,393
Smells like... like a saturday night at the drive-in.

365
00:23:12,470 --> 00:23:13,833
Can we take you on a tour?

366
00:23:13,910 --> 00:23:16,142
Our accommodations are state-of-the-art.

367
00:23:16,239 --> 00:23:17,872
This is very evocative.

368
00:23:17,959 --> 00:23:21,743
We have an electric magnetic resonance

369
00:23:21,793 --> 00:23:24,513
which is the latest thing in post-operative healing.

370
00:23:24,565 --> 00:23:25,911
And tivo.

371
00:23:26,853 --> 00:23:31,865
Whatever it is... my girlfriend Heidi Abramowitz used to wear this all the time.

372
00:23:37,852 --> 00:23:39,714
When were you planning on telling him?

373
00:23:40,554 --> 00:23:41,460
I wasn't.

374
00:23:41,532 --> 00:23:44,041
What were you gonna do, put him to sleep, change his face,

375
00:23:44,088 --> 00:23:46,985
and then when he woke up say, "surprise! Guess who you are."

376
00:23:47,046 --> 00:23:50,871
I was planning on mixing midazolam in with his juice to induce sleep.

377
00:23:50,932 --> 00:23:53,217
After the surgery, I'd tell him what I did.

378
00:23:53,273 --> 00:23:55,126
He'd either thank me or curse me.

379
00:23:55,177 --> 00:23:56,919
Either way, he'd stay alive.

380
00:23:56,954 --> 00:23:58,705
What about informed consent?

381
00:23:58,756 --> 00:23:59,569
If he were your son--

382
00:23:59,627 --> 00:24:02,397
He's a minor. His consent isn't necessary.

383
00:24:02,457 --> 00:24:03,498
It is for me.

384
00:24:03,553 --> 00:24:04,951
No, it is not.

385
00:24:05,014 --> 00:24:08,582
Your name is not on the door here, doctor. I thought I made that clear.

386
00:24:10,235 --> 00:24:14,189
Look, this isn't the first kid to come to us.

387
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:17,004
Last year we had one who ran away.

388
00:24:17,208 --> 00:24:18,319
Panicked.

389
00:24:18,801 --> 00:24:21,509
He was afraid his dog wouldn't recognize him.

390
00:24:22,197 --> 00:24:23,891
Ran home to find it...

391
00:24:24,490 --> 00:24:25,774
wound up dead.

392
00:24:26,614 --> 00:24:29,169
I don't want that on my conscience. Do you?

393
00:24:38,636 --> 00:24:41,206
Look, Chritian, this isn't a good time.

394
00:24:41,272 --> 00:24:43,069
Fine, thanks. And how are you?

395
00:24:44,223 --> 00:24:46,341
I'm sorry. I just can't talk now.

396
00:24:46,397 --> 00:24:48,697
No problem. You call me back from wherever the hell you are

397
00:24:48,732 --> 00:24:51,277
when you're finished doing whatever the hell you're doing.

398
00:24:51,641 --> 00:24:53,382
Ok. Go ahead. I'm listening.

399
00:24:57,989 --> 00:25:00,258
When we did the work on Mrs. Grubman,

400
00:25:00,612 --> 00:25:04,329
we both knew it was medically unsound, right?

401
00:25:04,407 --> 00:25:07,478
Ha. Mrs. Grubman was blackmailing us.

402
00:25:07,538 --> 00:25:09,699
She threatened to put us out of business. What's your point?

403
00:25:09,766 --> 00:25:13,709
So... we did it just for the money, didn't we?

404
00:25:13,946 --> 00:25:16,336
The patient was aware of the risks involved.

405
00:25:16,386 --> 00:25:18,598
She insisted on surgery despite our best advice,

406
00:25:18,644 --> 00:25:21,803
but yes, it was for the money. It was always for the money.

407
00:25:22,919 --> 00:25:26,299
Anyway, there's this new client who's offering a shit load of money

408
00:25:26,334 --> 00:25:29,775
for us to do this unorthodox procedure.

409
00:25:29,826 --> 00:25:31,716
Just what you always wanted, right?

410
00:25:31,813 --> 00:25:34,707
No ethnical restraints and a shit load of money.

411
00:25:34,733 --> 00:25:36,825
You left out sexual depravity and devil worship.

412
00:25:36,861 --> 00:25:40,215
What is it you want from me, advice? Because I don't have any to give!

413
00:25:40,824 --> 00:25:45,064
Chritian, I'm the last guy you should be calling for help with moral dilemmas,

414
00:25:45,071 --> 00:25:47,817
because I don't know. I don't have the answers.

415
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:52,632
You just have to figure it out on your own like I'm doing.

416
00:26:14,894 --> 00:26:16,302
How long have you been standing there?

417
00:26:16,870 --> 00:26:21,032
Uh, since sexual depravity and devil worship.

418
00:26:23,209 --> 00:26:24,730
Who were you talking to?

419
00:26:27,531 --> 00:26:29,896
No one. Anymore.

420
00:26:35,885 --> 00:26:36,976
Sean.

421
00:26:37,943 --> 00:26:38,932
Ahh!

422
00:26:40,780 --> 00:26:42,950
It's like we never even knew each other...

423
00:26:43,944 --> 00:26:45,567
ever cared about each other.

424
00:26:56,007 --> 00:26:57,620
He was my mirror, you know?

425
00:26:58,644 --> 00:27:01,936
I'd look at him and see who I was.

426
00:27:02,556 --> 00:27:04,864
Baby, you can't depend on mirrors.

427
00:27:05,315 --> 00:27:09,739
They can make you look fat or old or too thin.

428
00:27:11,250 --> 00:27:13,604
And Sean's made you look small.

429
00:27:14,716 --> 00:27:16,928
Way smaller than you are.

430
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:19,901
I feel like a part of me is gone.

431
00:27:22,078 --> 00:27:24,075
Maybe it's a part you don't need anymore...

432
00:27:24,218 --> 00:27:25,631
like an appendix.

433
00:27:26,333 --> 00:27:29,590
You only know it's there when it hurts, and once it's gone,

434
00:27:29,641 --> 00:27:33,041
you realize you never really needed it to begin with.

435
00:27:34,448 --> 00:27:36,794
You just got used to the pain.

436
00:27:37,449 --> 00:27:39,118
I'm glad Sean's gone.

437
00:27:45,697 --> 00:27:48,637
If you need a mirror to tell you who you are...

438
00:27:49,189 --> 00:27:50,757
you look at me.

439
00:27:56,689 --> 00:27:58,334
I know who you are,

440
00:27:58,503 --> 00:28:04,190
how big and strong and good you are.

441
00:28:11,123 --> 00:28:12,826
Let him go, baby.

442
00:28:14,769 --> 00:28:16,126
Just let him go.

443
00:28:27,056 --> 00:28:29,520
It's a quarter past. She said she'd be here at 4:00.

444
00:28:29,571 --> 00:28:31,270
It's called making us sweat.

445
00:28:31,317 --> 00:28:34,563
Look, we don't know why Ms. Rivers is coming.

446
00:28:34,614 --> 00:28:37,185
It may have nothing to do with the face mask.

447
00:28:37,507 --> 00:28:40,703
And if it does, we'll just play dumb and tell her to talk to our lawyer.

448
00:28:40,984 --> 00:28:42,187
We have a lawyer?

449
00:28:42,243 --> 00:28:43,257
We will.

450
00:28:43,375 --> 00:28:46,037
And if we can't afford one, the court will appoint one for us.

451
00:28:46,084 --> 00:28:49,560
Look on the bright side. The tabloids will go nuts.

452
00:28:49,621 --> 00:28:53,349
"Spa trio gives jizz to Joan." We'll be famous.

453
00:28:53,456 --> 00:28:56,189
Well, she'll be famous. We'll be stoned in the streets.

454
00:28:56,246 --> 00:28:57,275
That's the bright side?

455
00:28:57,307 --> 00:28:59,299
I don't wanna hear the dark side!

456
00:28:59,968 --> 00:29:02,272
Too late. I hear clicking down the hall.

457
00:29:02,975 --> 00:29:08,269
Ladies, time is money, and at my age inflation's a bitch.

458
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:12,478
I want to know who's responsible for La Premiere Vie face mask?

459
00:29:13,992 --> 00:29:15,596
It was my idea.

460
00:29:16,009 --> 00:29:18,144
Well, let's cut right to the chase.

461
00:29:18,487 --> 00:29:20,187
I think you know why I'm here, Julia.

462
00:29:20,228 --> 00:29:22,041
Ms. Rivers, please let me just say--

463
00:29:22,077 --> 00:29:24,458
Yesterday, I went home, I looked in the mirror.

464
00:29:24,514 --> 00:29:28,108
I looked like a goddamn gabor sister! I was a mess!

465
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:32,025
If I lived in Afghanistan, I wouldn't even come in last in a wet burka contest.

466
00:29:32,066 --> 00:29:33,863
I figured I had nothing to lose, so...

467
00:29:34,252 --> 00:29:35,568
Oh, dear god!

468
00:29:35,623 --> 00:29:36,874
Take a look at me.

469
00:29:36,935 --> 00:29:39,803
The three of you take a look at me!

470
00:29:40,145 --> 00:29:42,992
This stuff is miraculous!

471
00:29:43,044 --> 00:29:45,194
I'm canceling my surgery!

472
00:29:45,363 --> 00:29:47,503
And I'm here to offer the three of you a deal.

473
00:29:47,544 --> 00:29:51,656
50/50, plus my personal endorsement and infomercial.

474
00:29:51,737 --> 00:29:54,206
I'll have my lawyers draw up some contracts.

475
00:29:54,497 --> 00:29:56,596
Of course, with my name on it,

476
00:29:56,648 --> 00:30:00,212
we'll have this stuff on the face of every woman in America by Christmas.

477
00:30:00,263 --> 00:30:01,522
Uh, with your name?

478
00:30:01,578 --> 00:30:02,945
Of course!

479
00:30:03,211 --> 00:30:04,860
Joan Rivers...

480
00:30:05,219 --> 00:30:06,416
Forever.

481
00:30:06,523 --> 00:30:08,874
But it's our signature product.

482
00:30:09,288 --> 00:30:11,742
Your signature is worth bubkis.

483
00:30:11,793 --> 00:30:15,949
It's our entree into the business. It has to be connected to De La Mer.

484
00:30:17,650 --> 00:30:22,017
Ok, whatever. Then it'll be, uh... "Joan Rivers' De La Mer...

485
00:30:22,025 --> 00:30:25,724
La Premiere Vie, La Dolce Vida, La Grande Casa-- "

486
00:30:25,770 --> 00:30:28,100
who gives a damn? We'll just get a bigger jar!

487
00:30:28,156 --> 00:30:31,955
- But I want 50%.
- We'll take it.

488
00:30:32,006 --> 00:30:35,923
Ok. So, pending, of course, the manufacturer's specs.

489
00:30:35,975 --> 00:30:42,114
I want to know what is in this fabulous shit!

490
00:30:45,170 --> 00:30:49,194
Well, the active ingredient is...

491
00:30:54,013 --> 00:30:55,569
a spa secret.

492
00:30:57,497 --> 00:31:02,357
Your spa does not need a secret. Your spa is a secret!

493
00:31:02,404 --> 00:31:06,402
Ms. Rivers, we have no intention of divulging it to you or anyone,

494
00:31:06,443 --> 00:31:10,003
despite whatever advantages your name affords us.

495
00:31:10,284 --> 00:31:12,332
Take it or leave it.

496
00:31:15,801 --> 00:31:19,024
I totally underestimated you.

497
00:31:20,063 --> 00:31:24,747
I thought you were just one of those little... blond whoop de doops.

498
00:31:28,327 --> 00:31:29,294
Deal.

499
00:31:30,258 --> 00:31:33,115
I'll have my lawyer send the new contracts around in the morning.

500
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:39,991
See you tomorrow. Partners.

501
00:31:42,125 --> 00:31:43,539
And as for you...

502
00:31:44,337 --> 00:31:47,927
your husband was a schmuck to have dumped you.

503
00:31:49,376 --> 00:31:50,794
Schmuck.

504
00:31:59,350 --> 00:32:00,835
They're beautiful, aren't they?

505
00:32:01,357 --> 00:32:04,361
Did you know koi are one of the only fish that can see color?

506
00:32:05,247 --> 00:32:08,331
And apparently those guys can live to be over a hundred years old.

507
00:32:09,564 --> 00:32:10,976
They look sad.

508
00:32:12,487 --> 00:32:14,402
Like they're trapped or something.

509
00:32:15,075 --> 00:32:17,955
But they're a lot safer in here than in a lake, right?

510
00:32:18,078 --> 00:32:20,572
Fighting off predators and bacteria.

511
00:32:21,021 --> 00:32:25,026
They may not understand it, but if they did, I bet they'd feel a lot better.

512
00:32:26,777 --> 00:32:28,026
Will it hurt?

513
00:32:30,208 --> 00:32:31,769
The operation?

514
00:32:32,358 --> 00:32:34,084
During? No.

515
00:32:34,463 --> 00:32:36,351
After? Maybe a little.

516
00:32:37,017 --> 00:32:38,420
But you're a tough kid.

517
00:32:39,179 --> 00:32:42,209
I think you're strong enough to handle it. So does your mom.

518
00:32:47,115 --> 00:32:49,137
What if I refuse to do it?

519
00:32:51,142 --> 00:32:53,258
Would I be killed, like my dad?

520
00:32:53,656 --> 00:32:56,729
I don't know. But I don't want you to take that chance.

521
00:32:57,108 --> 00:33:00,042
I know it's tough when you think about what you'll be giving up,

522
00:33:00,072 --> 00:33:02,356
but when you think about what you're getting--

523
00:33:02,417 --> 00:33:05,064
a chance to grow up safe and protected...

524
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:06,641
it's worth it.

525
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:11,163
Well, we should go.

526
00:33:11,639 --> 00:33:13,746
I promised to have you home before dinner.

527
00:33:18,633 --> 00:33:19,569
Hey.

528
00:33:21,659 --> 00:33:22,933
Those fish in there...

529
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:26,036
they really live to be over a hundred?

530
00:33:26,452 --> 00:33:27,705
That's what I've heard.

531
00:33:30,891 --> 00:33:34,454
Ok. I can handle it.

532
00:33:34,807 --> 00:33:37,024
But I want you to be the one who does it.

533
00:33:54,494 --> 00:33:55,764
May I come in?

534
00:34:03,683 --> 00:34:07,724
Ah ha... I was actually planning on coming by later today.

535
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:10,028
I know that there are some papers for me to sign?

536
00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:12,655
We're not gonna do the surgery, Mr. White.

537
00:34:15,766 --> 00:34:17,248
- Is it a matter of money?
- No.

538
00:34:17,303 --> 00:34:19,300
- Because if it is, I can pay more.
- No.

539
00:34:19,350 --> 00:34:21,466
- How much do you want?
- No, it's got nothing to do with money.

540
00:34:21,516 --> 00:34:23,626
Dr. Costa assured me for a hundred thousand--

541
00:34:23,672 --> 00:34:27,036
He shouldn't have made any promises prematurely. Not without consulting me.

542
00:34:27,094 --> 00:34:28,444
I apologize.

543
00:34:29,002 --> 00:34:31,926
I have the name of a preeminent cognitive therapist.

544
00:34:31,977 --> 00:34:35,295
His speciaLizes in treating patients with ocd and other phobias.

545
00:34:35,336 --> 00:34:38,484
He feels confident that your particular... fetish--

546
00:34:38,537 --> 00:34:40,323
It's not a fetish.

547
00:34:40,999 --> 00:34:42,862
It is a legitimate medical condition.

548
00:34:42,908 --> 00:34:44,357
Whatever it is,

549
00:34:44,659 --> 00:34:48,792
he believes that he can treat it with behavioral modification.

550
00:34:55,350 --> 00:34:56,727
Do you think I'm crazy?

551
00:34:59,313 --> 00:35:00,501
Not at all.

552
00:35:01,223 --> 00:35:03,742
I wouldn't have... come here in person if I thought that.

553
00:35:03,789 --> 00:35:06,415
And I wouldn't have come to you if it weren't a last resort,

554
00:35:06,557 --> 00:35:08,007
if I weren't desperate.

555
00:35:08,062 --> 00:35:09,440
I understand that.

556
00:35:11,985 --> 00:35:13,343
Please put the gun down, Mr. White.

557
00:35:13,404 --> 00:35:17,560
I am so sick of you doctors who think you know all the goddamn answers.

558
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:21,821
Have you ever been desperate, Dr. Troy? Hmm?

559
00:35:22,149 --> 00:35:23,413
Yes, I have.

560
00:35:23,474 --> 00:35:25,344
You condescending asshole.

561
00:35:25,405 --> 00:35:27,735
You and your perfect body.

562
00:35:27,802 --> 00:35:31,267
You couldn't possibly understand what it is like to feel incomplete,

563
00:35:31,324 --> 00:35:33,444
that god made a mistake...

564
00:35:34,514 --> 00:35:36,776
that help is possible...

565
00:35:37,462 --> 00:35:40,529
But no one will give it to you!

566
00:35:47,749 --> 00:35:48,722
How much blood did he lose?

567
00:35:48,752 --> 00:35:51,087
At least a liter. Dr. Troy tied him up before there was more.

568
00:35:51,123 --> 00:35:53,068
Chritian... I didn't know you were there.

569
00:35:53,109 --> 00:35:54,379
He was a prospective patient.

570
00:35:54,426 --> 00:35:55,127
Blood pressure?

571
00:35:55,173 --> 00:35:56,810
80 systolic. Heart rate 120.

572
00:35:56,852 --> 00:35:59,161
Pupils are responsive. No sign of head injury.

573
00:35:59,314 --> 00:36:00,405
What the hell happened?

574
00:36:00,441 --> 00:36:01,265
He shot his leg off.

575
00:36:01,311 --> 00:36:04,346
Well, it's a good thing you were around. Any more blood loss, he'd be in shock now.

576
00:36:04,389 --> 00:36:08,803
Femoral artery is severed. It's missing about 10 centimeters proximal to the trifurcation.

577
00:36:08,848 --> 00:36:10,615
Most of the bone is still there.

578
00:36:10,666 --> 00:36:13,697
We can always do a vein graft, use bone plates if we have to.

579
00:36:13,733 --> 00:36:15,305
Ready the o-neg. Prep him for surgery.

580
00:36:15,350 --> 00:36:19,820
No... I don't want... I don't want it reattached.

581
00:36:20,041 --> 00:36:20,532
What?

582
00:36:20,594 --> 00:36:23,486
He did it on purpose. He wants to be an amputee.

583
00:36:23,759 --> 00:36:25,304
Please... help me...

584
00:36:25,345 --> 00:36:29,226
Look, it's a body integrity disorder, something he's suffered since childhood.

585
00:36:29,354 --> 00:36:31,505
I don't know, maybe it's not a good idea to--

586
00:36:31,561 --> 00:36:35,278
You know, Mr. White, you are a very lucky man.

587
00:36:35,335 --> 00:36:36,768
Your leg is salvageable.

588
00:36:37,301 --> 00:36:38,494
Move him into the O.R.

589
00:36:38,596 --> 00:36:41,202
I'll do it again... and again.

590
00:36:42,523 --> 00:36:44,505
And I'll keep doing it.

591
00:37:15,594 --> 00:37:19,515
Dr. Abrams has agreed to let me take over.

592
00:37:20,785 --> 00:37:23,565
Hospital privileges and patient requests.

593
00:37:25,419 --> 00:37:28,096
I reminded him of his "hypocritical" oath.

594
00:37:30,446 --> 00:37:31,352
Now...

595
00:37:33,211 --> 00:37:35,505
you sure about this? Because...

596
00:37:36,267 --> 00:37:39,519
once we separate the leg, there's no turning back.

597
00:37:42,275 --> 00:37:44,793
This might not give you what you're looking for.

598
00:37:45,654 --> 00:37:47,736
You might think it's the problem, but...

599
00:37:48,294 --> 00:37:51,396
once it's gone, you might miss it.

600
00:37:55,909 --> 00:37:56,983
Ok.

601
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:00,107
Let's take it off.

602
00:38:55,352 --> 00:38:57,317
First-rate, Dr. McNamara.

603
00:38:57,759 --> 00:38:59,878
'Course, the work isn't as lucrative.

604
00:38:59,955 --> 00:39:03,974
No. But it's a hell of a lot more satisfying.

605
00:39:04,898 --> 00:39:07,251
It's like we've given them a new life...

606
00:39:08,138 --> 00:39:09,750
a chance to start over.

607
00:39:11,082 --> 00:39:13,749
Too bad they had to lose everything to get it...

608
00:39:14,126 --> 00:39:17,235
their past, their identities.

609
00:39:17,419 --> 00:39:18,305
Yeah.

610
00:39:18,919 --> 00:39:22,774
Maybe sometimes you have to lose who you were to find out who you are.

611
00:39:25,709 --> 00:39:30,066
Believe me when I tell you this is a face mask that actually works,

612
00:39:30,132 --> 00:39:31,842
otherwise, I would not put my name on it.

613
00:39:31,858 --> 00:39:36,557
Don't worry, mrs. Cole. I have you down for a private room arriving on the 12th.

614
00:39:37,131 --> 00:39:39,516
I look forward to meeting you as well.

615
00:39:42,973 --> 00:39:44,878
De La Mer Spa. May I help you?

616
00:39:44,949 --> 00:39:47,975
Yes, I'm having my breasts enlarged, and I'd like to book a room.

617
00:39:48,037 --> 00:39:50,674
Sean, did you want something?

618
00:39:50,740 --> 00:39:52,983
'Cause we're kind of swamped right now.

619
00:39:53,054 --> 00:39:54,069
You're kidding?

620
00:39:54,232 --> 00:39:57,892
Don't act so shocked. We may even turn a profit this year.

621
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:59,215
Wow, that's, uh...

622
00:39:59,275 --> 00:40:03,412
Joan river endorsed us on an infomercial and business really picked up.

623
00:40:03,484 --> 00:40:07,410
Although it would be nice if McNamara/Troy threw us a patient every now and then.

624
00:40:07,483 --> 00:40:09,992
Oh. I'll tell Chritian then.

625
00:40:10,391 --> 00:40:11,963
That's amazing, Jules.

626
00:40:12,173 --> 00:40:16,289
All these years, I really believed I couldn't do anything without you.

627
00:40:16,356 --> 00:40:21,671
I kept looking to you for my self-esteem, hoping you'd complete me.

628
00:40:22,725 --> 00:40:25,291
Maybe we both just set it up that way.

629
00:40:25,817 --> 00:40:27,912
Maybe I needed to be depended on.

630
00:40:28,526 --> 00:40:29,617
Needed it.

631
00:40:30,743 --> 00:40:32,974
I guess we're both better off.

632
00:40:35,261 --> 00:40:37,768
I never in a million years would have guessed

633
00:40:37,813 --> 00:40:42,760
that in losing my marriage I'd be finding me.

634
00:40:42,837 --> 00:40:47,588
It's the first time in my life I feel like this... whole person.

635
00:40:47,952 --> 00:40:49,217
I'm happy for you.

636
00:40:49,831 --> 00:40:51,345
That you feel that way.

637
00:40:52,038 --> 00:40:53,143
Whole.

638
00:40:55,996 --> 00:40:58,412
I'd better go rescue Gina.

639
00:40:58,867 --> 00:41:02,063
When she gets flustered, she gets all potty-mouth.

640
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:03,572
Where are you calling from?

641
00:41:04,064 --> 00:41:06,717
Um... nowhere, really. Just--

642
00:41:06,752 --> 00:41:11,094
It's all right, Sean. You don't have to tell me. We're not married anymore, remember?

643
00:41:13,487 --> 00:41:15,692
I'm just touching base.

644
00:41:16,101 --> 00:41:17,817
I'm proud of you, Julia.

645
00:41:18,867 --> 00:41:23,233
You didn't compromise your integrity. You stayed true to yourself, and you succeeded.

646
00:41:25,456 --> 00:41:27,464
I... gotta go, Sean.

647
00:42:30,928 --> 00:42:32,031
Kimber.

648
00:42:39,307 --> 00:42:40,526
Chritian.

649
00:42:41,550 --> 00:42:43,127
What are you doing, honey?

650
00:42:45,850 --> 00:42:47,172
Marry me?

651
00:42:51,052 --> 00:42:52,917
Baby, we've been through this before.

652
00:42:52,967 --> 00:42:54,924
I know, I know, I know, but it's different now.

653
00:42:56,618 --> 00:42:57,858
Why?

654
00:43:02,103 --> 00:43:07,877
Today I took off a... man's leg so he could feel whole.

655
00:43:13,068 --> 00:43:15,169
What has that got to do with it?

656
00:43:15,251 --> 00:43:17,995
I guess you just have to do whatever it is that...

657
00:43:18,743 --> 00:43:22,326
makes you feel complete, no matter how crazy it is.

658
00:43:23,509 --> 00:43:27,589
All I know is that without you, something's... missing.

659
00:43:27,959 --> 00:43:28,874
Us.

660
00:43:30,125 --> 00:43:31,510
You and me.

661
00:43:33,974 --> 00:43:35,883
Till death do us part.

662
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:49,160
I love you.

663
00:43:51,730 --> 00:43:53,066
Say yes, Kimber.

664
00:44:00,685 --> 00:44:01,919
Marry me.

665
00:44:07,223 --> 00:44:08,237
Yes.

666
