1
00:00:00,455 --> 00:00:01,918
Previously on Nip/Tuck...

2
00:00:01,969 --> 00:00:03,244
Guess I'm early.

3
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:04,868
Maybe I should go.

4
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:06,086
Who are you?

5
00:00:06,362 --> 00:00:08,042
I'm me again, baby.

6
00:00:08,609 --> 00:00:09,582
I'm back.

7
00:00:10,925 --> 00:00:13,541
She came into my office for a small procedure.

8
00:00:13,607 --> 00:00:14,825
What kind of procedure?

9
00:00:14,902 --> 00:00:17,073
- Matt, it doesn't concern you.
- No, I wanna know.

10
00:00:17,185 --> 00:00:18,723
So is she a man or a woman?

11
00:00:18,814 --> 00:00:21,359
What matters is how she views herself, Matt.

12
00:00:21,416 --> 00:00:24,410
Are you man enough to make up your own mind about what pleases you?

13
00:00:24,483 --> 00:00:25,490
Buy me a drink?

14
00:00:27,037 --> 00:00:29,019
Whoa. You got a goddamn dick.

15
00:00:29,074 --> 00:00:31,989
Why didn't you tell me you were pre-op. You should've told me!

16
00:00:32,044 --> 00:00:34,107
If I wanna play with someone's cock,

17
00:00:34,164 --> 00:00:36,713
I got my own, you goddamn freak.

18
00:00:37,627 --> 00:00:40,570
I'm not gay, if that's what you're thinking, dad.

19
00:00:40,692 --> 00:00:42,980
You are almost unrecognizable.

20
00:00:43,893 --> 00:00:44,951
Holy shit.

21
00:00:47,061 --> 00:00:48,132
Come on, get him!

22
00:01:11,019 --> 00:01:12,702
He's gonna be all right, Julia.

23
00:01:12,774 --> 00:01:15,136
It's a simple reset with a couple of stitches.

24
00:01:15,289 --> 00:01:16,998
In 6 weeks, he'll look like new.

25
00:01:17,126 --> 00:01:20,279
I'm not worried about what he's gonna look like, Sean.

26
00:01:20,629 --> 00:01:23,471
I'm worried about what's going on inside him

27
00:01:23,684 --> 00:01:26,635
that's making him lie to us about what happened.

28
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:31,651
He's been completely shut off from us since you told him about Ava.

29
00:01:31,846 --> 00:01:32,697
Really?

30
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:37,162
I thought his erratic behavior began after you decided to serve me with divorce papers.

31
00:01:37,628 --> 00:01:39,111
What is wrong with you two?

32
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:41,466
Matt's bleeding, and you're so self-involved

33
00:01:41,477 --> 00:01:43,785
you're fighting over who gave him the straight razor.

34
00:01:43,791 --> 00:01:46,435
Christian, this really isn't any of your business.

35
00:01:46,505 --> 00:01:49,283
Your neglect of my son is my business.

36
00:01:49,438 --> 00:01:51,855
Look, I agreed to take a back seat to you two

37
00:01:51,901 --> 00:01:54,114
because I thought it was better to maintain consistency.

38
00:01:54,184 --> 00:01:55,670
Obviously, I was wrong.

39
00:01:55,721 --> 00:01:58,644
As soon as we're done resetting his face, I'm enlisting some professional help

40
00:01:58,696 --> 00:02:00,558
so we can make him talk about what happened.

41
00:02:00,605 --> 00:02:02,281
With all due respect, Christian,

42
00:02:02,326 --> 00:02:06,453
you know more about the different classes of tequila than you know about parenting.

43
00:02:06,811 --> 00:02:09,745
I know enough to know that the pound wouldn't give either of you

44
00:02:09,816 --> 00:02:12,767
a 10-year-old mutt covered in its own shit right now.

45
00:02:30,003 --> 00:02:31,342
What's he doing here?

46
00:02:31,613 --> 00:02:32,728
Assisting.

47
00:02:34,243 --> 00:02:35,746
Assisting who?

48
00:02:36,503 --> 00:02:37,602
Assisting me.

49
00:02:37,829 --> 00:02:40,578
This kind of cranial-facial work is Quentin's specialty.

50
00:02:40,655 --> 00:02:43,876
Not letting him operate on Matt would be... neglectful.

51
00:02:46,846 --> 00:02:48,734
Can't you all do it?

52
00:02:48,811 --> 00:02:50,433
No, Matt. It's a 2-man job,

53
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:52,175
and your father knew that.

54
00:02:52,570 --> 00:02:55,303
That's all right. Uh, well, I'm the short-timer.

55
00:02:55,437 --> 00:02:56,603
Christian can assist.

56
00:02:56,768 --> 00:02:57,761
Well, wait.

57
00:02:59,574 --> 00:03:02,360
Are you the guy that fixed my dad's face?

58
00:03:02,432 --> 00:03:03,597
Yes.

59
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:11,407
It's ok, Matt.

60
00:03:22,133 --> 00:03:23,438
You're gonna do great.

61
00:03:24,324 --> 00:03:27,550
Matt, count back from 10 for me, ok?

62
00:03:28,241 --> 00:03:32,300
10... 9... 8...

63
00:03:34,678 --> 00:03:35,860
11 blade...

64
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:39,730
Osteotome...

65
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:44,897
Mallet.

66
00:04:37,059 --> 00:04:40,198
How long is this gonna take, Mr. Miller? I've got a meeting in 45 minutes.

67
00:04:40,269 --> 00:04:41,775
Oh, like 10 minutes, tops.

68
00:04:41,821 --> 00:04:44,934
Look, I really appreciate you coming on short notice, Dr. Troy.

69
00:04:44,996 --> 00:04:47,704
The administration's pretty down on the greek system right now.

70
00:04:47,798 --> 00:04:49,595
We'd probably be expelled for this.

71
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:50,546
How'd you get my number?

72
00:04:50,612 --> 00:04:53,490
You did my mom. Her neck-lift.

73
00:04:53,598 --> 00:04:56,864
You did a great job, man. She got remarried, like, 4 months later.

74
00:04:57,161 --> 00:04:58,400
Congratulations.

75
00:04:58,703 --> 00:05:00,791
Plus, you're kind of a legend around here.

76
00:05:00,971 --> 00:05:03,413
Legend? Were you a brother at this frat?

77
00:05:03,474 --> 00:05:05,476
Chapter president, class of '86.

78
00:05:05,548 --> 00:05:07,122
And guys are still talking about him.

79
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:11,375
He turned this fraternity from a sausage fest into a pussy palace all by himself,

80
00:05:11,446 --> 00:05:12,986
and that's why we thought you'd be cool.

81
00:05:13,058 --> 00:05:16,950
Now, we can pay you everything in our rites of spring party fund, which is, like, 7 grand,

82
00:05:17,011 --> 00:05:18,752
but you have to keep this a secret.

83
00:05:18,829 --> 00:05:19,864
Keep what a secret?

84
00:05:22,976 --> 00:05:25,532
We tried watering them down and pulling them apart...

85
00:05:25,795 --> 00:05:27,958
But this stuff is like cement, man.

86
00:05:31,333 --> 00:05:33,258
Cyanoacrylate.

87
00:05:33,319 --> 00:05:35,577
This is industrial-strength adhesive.

88
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:38,295
Yeah. We tried calling the 800 number on the back of the bottle.

89
00:05:38,368 --> 00:05:40,702
They said once it dries, all you can use to unstick it

90
00:05:40,773 --> 00:05:44,388
is a chisel or a scraper or sandpaper.

91
00:05:49,318 --> 00:05:52,457
We should have enough lidocaine between the two of us for a quickie.

92
00:05:54,561 --> 00:05:55,760
You wanna operate in here?

93
00:05:55,831 --> 00:05:59,036
If we don't separate them here, we can't transport them.

94
00:06:05,929 --> 00:06:06,927
They're 18.

95
00:06:06,964 --> 00:06:10,751
We need them to sign this consent form to release us from any liability.

96
00:06:10,818 --> 00:06:12,748
You carry around your own release of liability forms.

97
00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:15,972
Physicians get sued for doing the heimlich maneuver at a restaurant.

98
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:17,638
You need to be prepared.

99
00:06:19,471 --> 00:06:22,702
Well, infection shouldn't be a problem if we can rush them to the E.R.

100
00:06:22,789 --> 00:06:25,292
We're gonna have to do some grafting in the office, but it can wait a day.

101
00:06:26,444 --> 00:06:28,236
Lidocaine or not, it's gonna hurt like hell.

102
00:06:31,806 --> 00:06:32,921
Hey, what's your name?

103
00:06:32,956 --> 00:06:34,431
Uh, D-Derek Jordan.

104
00:06:34,509 --> 00:06:36,671
Derek, I need you to sign this form

105
00:06:36,746 --> 00:06:40,721
so that Dr. Costa and I can perform surgery on the three of you.

106
00:06:40,832 --> 00:06:43,360
We're gonna give you local anesthetic, but, uh,

107
00:06:43,525 --> 00:06:45,138
there's still gonna be some pain.

108
00:06:45,368 --> 00:06:49,460
Now, you need to stay cool while we're cutting, understand?

109
00:06:49,551 --> 00:06:50,412
Got it.

110
00:06:52,474 --> 00:06:53,464
Thank you, Derek.

111
00:06:57,193 --> 00:06:58,363
And, you, sir?

112
00:07:00,175 --> 00:07:03,759
Screw this. I wanna go to the hospital. My dad's a doctor. I wanna talk to my dad.

113
00:07:03,836 --> 00:07:06,008
Your dad is an orthodontist, dickweed!

114
00:07:06,074 --> 00:07:08,261
You don't think dentists have to go to medical school, asshole?!

115
00:07:08,331 --> 00:07:13,180
Just sign the damn form, Alex, or I swear to god, I will shit your face.

116
00:07:13,846 --> 00:07:16,539
Dude, I'm freakin' out.

117
00:07:16,651 --> 00:07:21,290
If they don't cut me out of here soon, I'm gonna lose it and rip myself off.

118
00:07:22,054 --> 00:07:25,136
Fine. Give me the goddamn form.

119
00:07:31,222 --> 00:07:32,324
And you?

120
00:07:34,184 --> 00:07:35,185
Excellent.

121
00:07:35,478 --> 00:07:38,596
You guys might wanna leave. It's gonna get, uh, messy in here.

122
00:07:42,339 --> 00:07:44,080
At least give us some room?

123
00:07:44,341 --> 00:07:45,294
Please?

124
00:07:46,741 --> 00:07:47,716
Thank you.

125
00:07:49,105 --> 00:07:51,027
- Can I ask you a question?
- Mm-hmm.

126
00:07:52,276 --> 00:07:54,746
Why'd you ask me here with you instead of Sean?

127
00:07:56,813 --> 00:08:01,217
I was just thinking that if we're gonna be partners, then we needed to

128
00:08:01,282 --> 00:08:04,749
be active in developing our professional relationship.

129
00:08:12,102 --> 00:08:13,290
Bottoms up.

130
00:08:28,838 --> 00:08:29,797
Ready?

131
00:08:30,954 --> 00:08:34,870
1... 2... 3...

132
00:08:44,262 --> 00:08:45,070
Sorry.

133
00:08:46,109 --> 00:08:46,969
Did you read the file?

134
00:08:47,051 --> 00:08:47,917
Enough of it.

135
00:08:49,074 --> 00:08:50,339
Can you get him to talk?

136
00:08:51,092 --> 00:08:53,400
I think I can handle a teenage boy.

137
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,777
Your dad is an excellent surgeon.

138
00:08:58,197 --> 00:09:01,495
As soon as the swelling goes down, the girls won't notice a thing.

139
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:06,270
Who's this?

140
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,294
This is Kit McGraw.

141
00:09:08,332 --> 00:09:09,681
She's a friend of mine.

142
00:09:09,777 --> 00:09:13,537
She's also a detective in the, uh, Sex Crimes Unit at Miami-Dade.

143
00:09:13,609 --> 00:09:15,328
Well, this wasn't a sex crime.

144
00:09:15,513 --> 00:09:17,885
This was just a simple schoolyard fight.

145
00:09:17,965 --> 00:09:20,649
I mean, why would we waste Ms. McGraw's time with it?

146
00:09:20,721 --> 00:09:22,937
Because none of the doughnut-dunkers who have interviewed him

147
00:09:22,988 --> 00:09:25,523
have even come close to finding out who did this.

148
00:09:25,784 --> 00:09:28,324
Kit is the best detective in the department.

149
00:09:28,667 --> 00:09:31,857
She's handling the, um--the carver case.

150
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:36,929
This is standard stuff for me, Matt.

151
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:40,478
The file is pretty clear, but I'd like to go over your story again.

152
00:09:41,191 --> 00:09:43,664
They really did a number on you, didn't they?

153
00:09:43,951 --> 00:09:46,100
Matt said it was just one guy.

154
00:09:46,572 --> 00:09:49,411
The bruising on his arms is indicative of someone holding him down

155
00:09:49,427 --> 00:09:52,055
while at least one other person worked over his face.

156
00:09:52,128 --> 00:09:56,403
You seem like a pretty strong kid, but not even you could fight off 3 or 4 guys, right, Matt?

157
00:09:56,434 --> 00:10:00,479
Well... I mean, I guess it could've been more than one guy.

158
00:10:00,529 --> 00:10:04,749
After the first sucker punch, I don't really remember much except for the fists.

159
00:10:04,810 --> 00:10:07,381
In your statement, you described the guy--

160
00:10:07,452 --> 00:10:11,338
guys-- as latin with some gang tattoos.

161
00:10:11,414 --> 00:10:13,469
Can you tell me what their girlfriends looked like?

162
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:14,871
How the hell would I know that?

163
00:10:14,937 --> 00:10:16,355
These are fingernail marks.

164
00:10:16,427 --> 00:10:19,058
When men scratch they cause shallow, uneven cuts.

165
00:10:19,130 --> 00:10:20,820
These run deep and consistent.

166
00:10:20,887 --> 00:10:23,713
Someone with long manicured fingernails did this.

167
00:10:24,081 --> 00:10:25,751
I wish they'd scraped these for polish.

168
00:10:25,812 --> 00:10:28,577
Yeah, well, whatever. Like I said, I don't remember anything.

169
00:10:28,608 --> 00:10:30,666
Um, what is this, mom?

170
00:10:30,722 --> 00:10:34,322
I think this is enough, Miss McGraw. Matt should rest now.

171
00:10:35,622 --> 00:10:40,819
Thanks, Matt. I'll, uh, amend the report and make sure the investigating officer sees it.

172
00:10:46,923 --> 00:10:49,569
Wait, wait, wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait.

173
00:10:49,641 --> 00:10:50,352
That's it?

174
00:10:50,424 --> 00:10:51,249
He doesn't wanna talk.

175
00:10:51,304 --> 00:10:53,654
That didn't stop you from strapping the electrodes to my nuts.

176
00:10:53,716 --> 00:10:55,667
He's just a kid, Christian.

177
00:10:55,821 --> 00:10:59,015
I didn't bring you here to play tetherball with him, Kit.

178
00:10:59,093 --> 00:11:00,695
You're taking the leash off?

179
00:11:01,647 --> 00:11:03,967
Because you might not like what you hear.

180
00:11:09,373 --> 00:11:12,405
Have you committed a crime in the last few weeks, Matt?

181
00:11:12,461 --> 00:11:14,180
Rape, assault?

182
00:11:14,254 --> 00:11:16,450
Something to piss someone off enough for them to seek revenge?

183
00:11:16,490 --> 00:11:18,184
What? No.

184
00:11:18,246 --> 00:11:22,772
- Matt was the victim here.
- Matt is lying, Mrs. McNamara.

185
00:11:22,835 --> 00:11:26,177
People who get assaulted for no reason don't conceal facts.

186
00:11:26,223 --> 00:11:29,671
They don't forget how many people attacked them or if they were men or women.

187
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:32,588
That's what guilty people who were jumped for a reason do.

188
00:11:32,659 --> 00:11:34,768
Are you saying he did something to precipitate this?

189
00:11:34,831 --> 00:11:36,530
Whoa. I got jumped.

190
00:11:36,592 --> 00:11:38,804
I can't believe you're taking her word over mine.

191
00:11:38,871 --> 00:11:42,023
The police report says you were soaking wet when you were discovered, Matt.

192
00:11:42,172 --> 00:11:45,889
The lab results on your clothes revealed that the fluid covering your body was urine.

193
00:11:45,901 --> 00:11:47,912
We weren't told that. Did you know that, Sean?

194
00:11:47,979 --> 00:11:49,309
No. That's not in the file.

195
00:11:49,371 --> 00:11:51,795
Not yet, but you know how that works, Doctor.

196
00:11:51,806 --> 00:11:54,681
You need lab results quickly, you just need to know who to call.

197
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:57,112
What did you do to her, Matt?

198
00:11:57,610 --> 00:12:01,132
Did you screw her best friend, slip her a roofie, rape her?

199
00:12:01,143 --> 00:12:04,255
What made her so mad that she and a group of her girlfriends felt the need

200
00:12:04,261 --> 00:12:06,734
to mess up your pretty face and then piss all over you?

201
00:12:06,795 --> 00:12:08,572
You don't know shit.

202
00:12:08,584 --> 00:12:12,248
I know that I'd lie, too, if I had the crap beaten out of me by a bunch of cheerleaders.

203
00:12:12,319 --> 00:12:13,507
They weren't cheerleaders!

204
00:12:13,574 --> 00:12:14,931
They were men!

205
00:12:23,292 --> 00:12:25,611
They were men dressed as women.

206
00:12:30,343 --> 00:12:32,914
One of them made a pass at me outside of a she-male bar,

207
00:12:32,929 --> 00:12:35,125
and I beat the living shit out of him for it.

208
00:12:35,246 --> 00:12:37,571
I guess this was revenge.

209
00:12:38,569 --> 00:12:42,169
What were you doing at a bar for transsexuals?

210
00:12:44,043 --> 00:12:45,836
I was looking for Ava.

211
00:12:58,430 --> 00:12:59,848
Military school?

212
00:12:59,933 --> 00:13:03,613
The Hutton Academy is not a military school, it's a disciplinary institution.

213
00:13:03,668 --> 00:13:07,544
And the 2 plums between my legs are not balls, they're testicles.

214
00:13:08,297 --> 00:13:10,374
I can't believe that you want this for him.

215
00:13:10,422 --> 00:13:14,282
Matt needs something radical, so unless you have any better suggestions...

216
00:13:14,370 --> 00:13:18,486
He's depressed and highly anxious. I saw we start him off on a low dosage of Luvox,

217
00:13:18,557 --> 00:13:20,289
and Xanax for panic attacks.

218
00:13:20,349 --> 00:13:21,824
You're not starting him on anything.

219
00:13:21,881 --> 00:13:25,187
Matt's not gonna be able to face his issues if he's in a sedated haze.

220
00:13:25,243 --> 00:13:27,634
They're not sedatives, they just help him relax enough

221
00:13:27,691 --> 00:13:30,405
so that he can deal with what's really hurting him.

222
00:13:30,487 --> 00:13:31,619
I don't know, Christian.

223
00:13:31,675 --> 00:13:34,921
Maybe Sean's right. Matt needs structure, and,

224
00:13:35,003 --> 00:13:39,411
you know, maybe Hutton wouldn't be the worst idea for a couple of months.

225
00:13:39,647 --> 00:13:41,566
You put him in a straight jacket, and I swear to god,

226
00:13:41,618 --> 00:13:43,809
he will gnaw his arms off just to get out of it.

227
00:13:43,866 --> 00:13:47,218
Wake up, Christian. Our coddling and laissez-faire attitudes

228
00:13:47,292 --> 00:13:50,138
led to him getting pissed on by a bunch of transsexuals.

229
00:13:50,306 --> 00:13:54,839
Kids whose parents are on top of them don't beat down strangers outside of bars.

230
00:13:54,946 --> 00:13:56,307
I won't let you do this.

231
00:13:56,522 --> 00:13:57,793
It's 2 to one.

232
00:13:58,140 --> 00:13:59,528
You don't have a choice.

233
00:14:17,319 --> 00:14:18,365
You all right?

234
00:14:19,957 --> 00:14:21,989
Used to do this when he was a kid,

235
00:14:22,448 --> 00:14:23,633
watch him sleep.

236
00:14:24,523 --> 00:14:25,901
Well, he's going to be fine.

237
00:14:26,249 --> 00:14:29,040
Young skin, very elastic.

238
00:14:29,117 --> 00:14:31,625
I'm not worried about the outside scars.

239
00:14:31,891 --> 00:14:33,857
Those I know I can fix.

240
00:14:38,773 --> 00:14:41,522
Is every one of your screw-ups your father's fault?

241
00:14:42,577 --> 00:14:43,401
No.

242
00:14:43,546 --> 00:14:46,028
Then you need to stop killing yourself about this.

243
00:14:46,206 --> 00:14:47,406
Shit happens.

244
00:14:47,539 --> 00:14:48,916
People make mistakes.

245
00:14:50,186 --> 00:14:53,007
You just need to blow off some steam, and get some perspective.

246
00:14:53,079 --> 00:14:54,567
Take your head out of that vise.

247
00:14:56,355 --> 00:14:59,443
If you need anything, give a call.

248
00:15:00,856 --> 00:15:01,781
Hey.

249
00:15:02,162 --> 00:15:03,001
Yeah?

250
00:15:04,835 --> 00:15:07,378
You wanna go grab some stone-crabs?

251
00:15:08,765 --> 00:15:12,022
I'd love to, but I have plans.

252
00:15:13,144 --> 00:15:14,812
I think Christian's still here, though.

253
00:15:15,495 --> 00:15:19,621
If I can't offer him naked Victoria secret models, and a case of cristal,

254
00:15:19,713 --> 00:15:22,094
I'm persona-non-grata on a friday night.

255
00:15:26,676 --> 00:15:28,099
Do you wanna come out with me?

256
00:15:39,153 --> 00:15:41,504
Is this your usual party scene?

257
00:15:42,036 --> 00:15:46,243
No. No, even I tend to skew a little older.

258
00:15:46,834 --> 00:15:50,873
Christian and I were doing some work over here yesterday. The invite was a thank you.

259
00:15:51,109 --> 00:15:52,453
You and Christian?

260
00:15:52,972 --> 00:15:54,216
He didn't tell me about it.

261
00:15:54,279 --> 00:15:55,466
Well, it's no big deal.

262
00:15:55,743 --> 00:15:57,862
It was a college prank gone awry.

263
00:16:01,954 --> 00:16:04,170
We don't belong here, these are just kids.

264
00:16:04,251 --> 00:16:07,559
Sean, these are fountains of youth.

265
00:16:07,724 --> 00:16:12,460
We work all day on flabby, middle-aged flesh, boob jobs, tummy-tucks, lipo...

266
00:16:12,536 --> 00:16:16,715
all we do is try to make 40-year-olds look like these girls.

267
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:19,105
You can say this is research.

268
00:16:19,719 --> 00:16:23,565
Hey, you're not a nerdy pre-med anymore, Sean.

269
00:16:23,602 --> 00:16:28,133
You are a hot-shit plastic surgeon in reasonably expensive shoes.

270
00:16:28,711 --> 00:16:30,631
These girls are gonna be clawing for you.

271
00:16:32,228 --> 00:16:34,404
Doc, you made it!

272
00:16:34,421 --> 00:16:36,384
- Hey.
- Hey! Is doctor troy with ya?

273
00:16:36,472 --> 00:16:41,336
No, he sends his regrets, and his partner Dr. Sean McNamara.

274
00:16:41,403 --> 00:16:43,252
Right on! Hey, man.

275
00:16:43,355 --> 00:16:44,032
Hey.

276
00:16:46,462 --> 00:16:47,922
What are the bracelets for?

277
00:16:47,947 --> 00:16:49,647
Oh, it's a bracelet party.

278
00:16:50,491 --> 00:16:51,981
They're color coded.

279
00:16:52,124 --> 00:16:55,626
See, every girl where's which ever color they're looking for tonight.

280
00:16:55,692 --> 00:16:59,798
Like, blue means they like head, double blue means they like 69,

281
00:16:59,867 --> 00:17:03,522
pink means they're into girls, too. Sorta streamlines the whole process.

282
00:17:03,588 --> 00:17:06,507
Is there a bracelet for girls who likes guys twice their age?

283
00:17:06,906 --> 00:17:09,211
Green. Means they like money.

284
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:11,140
Come on.

285
00:17:14,882 --> 00:17:16,229
How's Matt, Christian?

286
00:17:16,598 --> 00:17:20,653
He's recovering faster from the first beat down he got than the one he got from herr McGraw.

287
00:17:20,734 --> 00:17:24,227
Don't let this slide, Christian. That kid has some deep-seated problems.

288
00:17:24,289 --> 00:17:26,332
I think I'll skip the parenting advice from the girl

289
00:17:26,382 --> 00:17:29,393
who likes to spank me while I call her "daddy."

290
00:17:29,496 --> 00:17:32,000
Every gay basher I've ever busted was expressing something

291
00:17:32,017 --> 00:17:34,208
they couldn't safely express sexually.

292
00:17:34,267 --> 00:17:36,086
Are you suggesting that Matt is gay?

293
00:17:36,152 --> 00:17:38,804
I'm just suggesting that he should talk to somebody.

294
00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:41,962
3 tickets to the Vin Diesel movie.

295
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:43,677
Ok. I thought we were seeing Jude Law.

296
00:17:43,756 --> 00:17:46,310
I am not sitting through 3 hours of Jude Law.

297
00:17:46,392 --> 00:17:48,690
Doesn't he get castrated at the end this one?

298
00:17:48,808 --> 00:17:52,588
You always get to choose the movie. We haven't seen a movie I liked in 2 years.

299
00:17:53,175 --> 00:17:57,564
Well, I'm sorry if the movies I like aren't the cinematic masterpieces you direct, Kimber.

300
00:17:57,743 --> 00:18:00,990
Those masterpieces grossed more in the first month dvd sales

301
00:18:01,046 --> 00:18:03,682
then you made last year, asshole.

302
00:18:07,062 --> 00:18:08,368
This is your fault.

303
00:18:08,819 --> 00:18:11,701
You're constantly whispering in her ear, trying to box me out.

304
00:18:11,782 --> 00:18:13,773
You've been treating Kimber like shit for years.

305
00:18:13,845 --> 00:18:15,811
You should be thanking me for helping your relationship grow

306
00:18:15,862 --> 00:18:17,778
by making sure she stands up for herself.

307
00:18:17,829 --> 00:18:19,648
Kimber and I understand each other.

308
00:18:19,729 --> 00:18:20,921
We've got a shorthand.

309
00:18:20,993 --> 00:18:23,072
Yeah, and you've been using it to slap her in the ass.

310
00:18:23,132 --> 00:18:26,006
Kimber's not some bimbo model anymore. She doesn't need you.

311
00:18:26,451 --> 00:18:29,507
You wanna keep her around, I recommend that you choose your moves,

312
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:32,119
and your movies, more carefully.

313
00:18:33,977 --> 00:18:34,965
Cheer up.

314
00:18:35,944 --> 00:18:38,243
If you're good, I'll give you a handjob in an hour or 2.

315
00:18:42,282 --> 00:18:44,633
2 for the one where the guy gets his balls cut off.

316
00:18:49,511 --> 00:18:50,940
Jerk each other off.

317
00:19:14,021 --> 00:19:14,789
Hi.

318
00:19:15,936 --> 00:19:16,689
Hi.

319
00:19:20,114 --> 00:19:21,277
I'm Amber.

320
00:19:21,406 --> 00:19:24,057
Sean. My tie.

321
00:19:26,796 --> 00:19:30,017
What do the braided ones mean?

322
00:19:31,727 --> 00:19:35,089
That means for the right guy, I'd do anything.

323
00:19:36,405 --> 00:19:37,338
Thank you.

324
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,296
Cheers.

325
00:19:59,774 --> 00:20:02,150
I'm happy to give you a cursory examination, Amber,

326
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:07,082
but I can tell you before I even look you do not need liposuction.

327
00:20:18,319 --> 00:20:19,195
Wait.

328
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:20,736
Now, come on.

329
00:20:22,729 --> 00:20:24,632
I'm old enough to be your father.

330
00:20:25,058 --> 00:20:26,952
Age is just a state of mind.

331
00:20:27,489 --> 00:20:29,860
My medieval lit professor taught me that.

332
00:20:30,537 --> 00:20:32,127
I slept with him, too.

333
00:20:46,374 --> 00:20:49,008
Do all surgeons have such great hands?

334
00:20:50,217 --> 00:20:53,575
Do all anthropology majors have such great breasts?

335
00:20:56,322 --> 00:20:57,907
You are cute.

336
00:21:15,233 --> 00:21:16,084
Hi.

337
00:21:19,339 --> 00:21:20,968
Do you guys mind if we use the bed?

338
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:22,933
Oh, no problem.

339
00:21:57,112 --> 00:22:01,524
Um, I'm sorry. I've got to go.

340
00:22:03,727 --> 00:22:04,596
Sorry.

341
00:22:15,179 --> 00:22:16,408
Looking for someone?

342
00:22:21,681 --> 00:22:22,628
How does it feel?

343
00:22:24,244 --> 00:22:25,723
It throbs a little.

344
00:22:29,842 --> 00:22:30,643
This'll help.

345
00:22:42,634 --> 00:22:45,867
Are you pissed at me for wanting that other guy to do my surgery?

346
00:22:47,225 --> 00:22:49,544
Biology aside, Mattie, we're friends.

347
00:22:49,857 --> 00:22:52,294
Takes a lot more than that to piss off a friend.

348
00:22:52,517 --> 00:22:54,009
What about mom and dad?

349
00:22:54,105 --> 00:22:56,615
They're not quite so high on you right now.

350
00:22:56,708 --> 00:22:59,488
They wanna send you to Hutton Academy for the rest of the semester.

351
00:22:59,718 --> 00:23:02,472
That place is a prison camp, man. They can't do that.

352
00:23:02,544 --> 00:23:03,920
Technically, they can,

353
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:05,826
but we're not gonna let 'em.

354
00:23:07,592 --> 00:23:11,061
To make the situation right, you and I have to work as a team.

355
00:23:16,512 --> 00:23:18,810
This is an antidepressant.

356
00:23:18,928 --> 00:23:20,793
Take one tablet every morning.

357
00:23:21,693 --> 00:23:25,307
This is for anxiety attacks.

358
00:23:25,395 --> 00:23:28,738
Take one tablet every time you feel like you're losing it.

359
00:23:29,082 --> 00:23:30,597
But no booze with these?

360
00:23:31,959 --> 00:23:33,300
- Hmm?
- Ok.

361
00:23:34,268 --> 00:23:35,313
Not so fast.

362
00:23:37,555 --> 00:23:38,997
We're teammates, right?

363
00:23:39,625 --> 00:23:40,527
Yeah.

364
00:23:41,754 --> 00:23:44,196
I wanna know the truth about you and Ava.

365
00:23:44,888 --> 00:23:48,461
Were you completely fooled or was there something about her being a man that worked for you?

366
00:23:48,517 --> 00:23:50,735
Why does everyone suddenly think I'm gay?

367
00:23:50,791 --> 00:23:55,096
Because you and I both know you didn't go to that tranny bar believing you'd actually find her.

368
00:23:56,654 --> 00:23:59,039
Look, it's totally cool with me if you are.

369
00:23:59,290 --> 00:24:02,177
Look, I like girls, ok?

370
00:24:02,295 --> 00:24:06,104
I liked Ava because I thought she was one.

371
00:24:12,294 --> 00:24:16,088
I guess someone with your limited experience could be fooled by her.

372
00:24:16,191 --> 00:24:18,505
It was only through my extensive vaginal expertise

373
00:24:18,567 --> 00:24:22,275
that I realized I was inside something artificial.

374
00:24:23,457 --> 00:24:25,146
What do you mean inside?

375
00:24:28,555 --> 00:24:30,465
Did you sleep with her?

376
00:24:33,518 --> 00:24:34,644
Just once.

377
00:24:35,253 --> 00:24:37,793
How else do you think we realized she was a post-op?

378
00:24:37,930 --> 00:24:40,071
You call yourself a friend?!

379
00:24:40,573 --> 00:24:41,438
Hey!

380
00:24:41,761 --> 00:24:46,184
Friends don't sleep with each other's girlfriends!

381
00:24:46,272 --> 00:24:49,716
Oh, wait. But I guess you have a habit of doing that, don't you?

382
00:24:49,783 --> 00:24:52,334
I was trying to save you from her, you little shit.

383
00:24:53,188 --> 00:24:54,817
I thought that if she had sex with me,

384
00:24:54,868 --> 00:24:57,294
you would see her for the manipulative slut that she is.

385
00:24:57,357 --> 00:25:00,227
Oh? And how did you think I was gonna feel about you afterwards?

386
00:25:00,232 --> 00:25:01,806
I didn't care!

387
00:25:01,954 --> 00:25:04,986
I'd rather you hate me than see you destroy yourself.

388
00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:13,735
Let her go.

389
00:25:32,006 --> 00:25:33,120
What are you doing here?

390
00:25:33,483 --> 00:25:38,824
Oh, I'm sorry. I was just picking up a couple of things to bring to Matt, you know,

391
00:25:38,856 --> 00:25:40,698
make him feel more at home.

392
00:25:41,675 --> 00:25:43,990
I guess I've been lingering.

393
00:25:47,779 --> 00:25:49,048
I know the feeling.

394
00:25:50,350 --> 00:25:52,694
I actually fell asleep in here last night.

395
00:25:58,075 --> 00:26:00,297
What happened to us, Sean?

396
00:26:01,751 --> 00:26:03,907
You know, I look at his bed, and

397
00:26:04,423 --> 00:26:10,082
I remember the 3 of us spending all day in that damn furniture showroom

398
00:26:10,152 --> 00:26:15,058
haggling over $200, remember, with the salesman wearing the bad toupee.

399
00:26:15,436 --> 00:26:16,558
Oh, god.

400
00:26:19,598 --> 00:26:23,477
Those parents would have never let this all happen.

401
00:26:24,315 --> 00:26:25,973
They were naive, but...

402
00:26:26,492 --> 00:26:27,919
they loved each other.

403
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:30,669
There's still love, Julia.

404
00:26:31,088 --> 00:26:32,114
It's just...

405
00:26:36,266 --> 00:26:39,645
it's just buried under all this... shit.

406
00:26:43,785 --> 00:26:47,310
Look what I found at the bottom of the desk drawer.

407
00:26:50,095 --> 00:26:53,729
"Happy anniversary to Dr. and Mrs. Perfect,

408
00:26:54,717 --> 00:26:59,331
love Matt... your son." Ha! That's great.

409
00:26:59,715 --> 00:27:00,657
When is this from?

410
00:27:00,956 --> 00:27:01,968
Fourth grade.

411
00:27:14,168 --> 00:27:17,037
I shouldn't have blamed you for all this.

412
00:27:22,116 --> 00:27:25,490
Just tell me everything's gonna be all right.

413
00:27:26,964 --> 00:27:29,185
Everything is gonna be all right.

414
00:28:26,167 --> 00:28:27,338
Very nice.

415
00:28:41,337 --> 00:28:42,883
What are you doing here?

416
00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:44,989
I thought I'd check myself out.

417
00:28:45,864 --> 00:28:48,475
I don't care how expensive the sheets are in that recovery spa,

418
00:28:48,521 --> 00:28:50,333
it still smells like a damn hospital.

419
00:28:50,406 --> 00:28:52,403
That's because it is a hospital, Matt,

420
00:28:52,463 --> 00:28:54,374
for patients that need around-the-clock monitoring.

421
00:28:54,430 --> 00:28:57,354
You're supposed to be on IV fluids for 2 more days.

422
00:28:57,789 --> 00:28:59,810
I can see why you'd want me there.

423
00:28:59,872 --> 00:29:02,800
What's the matter, your own bed have too many bad memories?

424
00:29:02,888 --> 00:29:05,193
This isn't what it looks like, Matt.

425
00:29:05,684 --> 00:29:08,433
Hey, it's cool. If you guys wanna give it another go...

426
00:29:08,531 --> 00:29:12,472
No, we're not giving it another go. It was a one-time thing.

427
00:29:14,049 --> 00:29:16,871
I'm gonna go put clean sheets on my bed...

428
00:29:17,035 --> 00:29:18,166
and take a nap.

429
00:29:20,623 --> 00:29:21,823
Xanex?!

430
00:29:23,072 --> 00:29:25,022
Who prescribed these for you?

431
00:29:27,838 --> 00:29:28,971
My dad.

432
00:29:30,721 --> 00:29:33,553
See, that's the advantage of having 3 parents.

433
00:29:33,609 --> 00:29:36,988
You can always be sure that one's gonna give you what you need.

434
00:29:38,401 --> 00:29:39,067
Hey--

435
00:29:39,070 --> 00:29:41,191
Hey! Don't put your hands on me!

436
00:29:41,273 --> 00:29:43,645
These drugs are only gonna stop your pain temporarily.

437
00:29:43,702 --> 00:29:46,214
They're not gonna help you deal with your real problems.

438
00:29:47,034 --> 00:29:49,967
You might think you outrank everyone,

439
00:29:50,034 --> 00:29:53,526
but that doesn't mean you have any idea what I need right now.

440
00:29:53,602 --> 00:29:55,220
Then tell us, Matt.

441
00:29:55,307 --> 00:29:58,103
We're your parents. We're not the enemy.

442
00:29:58,185 --> 00:29:59,429
Yes, tell me.

443
00:29:59,824 --> 00:30:02,486
Do you need me to hug you? Hit you?

444
00:30:02,552 --> 00:30:05,040
Whatever it takes to get you back, I'll do it.

445
00:30:06,384 --> 00:30:10,023
Then give me my pills and leave me alone.

446
00:30:10,299 --> 00:30:11,762
I can't do that.

447
00:30:12,101 --> 00:30:14,425
You're in no condition to be self-medicating.

448
00:30:15,727 --> 00:30:20,237
Don't ask me what I need if you're not willing to give it to me, all right?

449
00:31:26,101 --> 00:31:28,745
I can't believe you took those frat boys up on their offer.

450
00:31:28,957 --> 00:31:30,566
Rockin' the cradle of love, huh?

451
00:31:31,037 --> 00:31:32,506
Yeah. It was almost too easy.

452
00:31:32,572 --> 00:31:34,375
We were like these two vulva magnets.

453
00:31:34,447 --> 00:31:35,205
We?

454
00:31:35,511 --> 00:31:37,085
Yeah. Sean came with me.

455
00:31:39,362 --> 00:31:43,438
Sean? I... can't see Sean enjoying something like that.

456
00:31:43,499 --> 00:31:46,059
Well, tell that to the co-ed who had her head on his lap.

457
00:31:52,206 --> 00:31:55,894
I wish I had the energy for a little vagina U, but, uh...

458
00:31:56,421 --> 00:31:58,209
I got my hands full at home.

459
00:31:58,286 --> 00:31:59,971
Oh? Girlfriend?

460
00:32:00,037 --> 00:32:03,917
My girlfriend I can handle. It's my girlfriend's girlfriend that's wiping me out.

461
00:32:05,997 --> 00:32:07,947
You are my idol.

462
00:32:08,367 --> 00:32:09,770
How do you get up for work?

463
00:32:09,827 --> 00:32:13,339
The sex isn't the tiring part. It's the constant jockeying for position.

464
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:18,198
I find myself fighting nonstop to keep my status as cock of the walk.

465
00:32:18,269 --> 00:32:22,194
I know. Sounds like quite a burden. Hey, anytime I can help you out...

466
00:32:24,039 --> 00:32:25,269
How about tonight?

467
00:32:26,564 --> 00:32:29,482
I'm serious. I--I need a break.

468
00:32:30,363 --> 00:32:33,272
Come take kit off my hands for the night, hmm?

469
00:32:33,455 --> 00:32:37,434
College bj's are nice, q, but, uh, aim a little higher.

470
00:32:41,007 --> 00:32:43,143
Christian, are you sure there's not gonna be any jealousy?

471
00:32:43,179 --> 00:32:45,211
I'd hate to have things be awkward around here.

472
00:32:46,019 --> 00:32:47,222
Hardly.

473
00:32:47,668 --> 00:32:51,708
I'd consider it a... personal favor.

474
00:32:58,221 --> 00:33:02,286
So, Christian tells me that you're working the carver case.

475
00:33:02,304 --> 00:33:03,285
Any leads?

476
00:33:03,448 --> 00:33:04,427
Some.

477
00:33:05,302 --> 00:33:07,871
You've got to stalk his kind of predator.

478
00:33:08,522 --> 00:33:11,006
It takes time. My last case took 2 years.

479
00:33:11,033 --> 00:33:14,277
Some psycho near stepney green who got off on attacking couples.

480
00:33:14,375 --> 00:33:18,916
He'd tie the man up and then make him watch as he raped the girl.

481
00:33:22,582 --> 00:33:25,413
Well, there's a fetish for everyone, isn't there?

482
00:33:28,001 --> 00:33:29,746
I'm sorry, Kimber, uh...

483
00:33:30,734 --> 00:33:32,294
this is very embarrassing.

484
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:34,486
I'm completely star-struck.

485
00:33:34,548 --> 00:33:36,764
I--I've seen all your movies.

486
00:33:37,394 --> 00:33:38,809
How sweet.

487
00:33:38,882 --> 00:33:40,570
I have a new series coming up.

488
00:33:40,807 --> 00:33:43,739
It's called two girls, a guy, and a cum face.

489
00:33:43,752 --> 00:33:46,142
It's loosely based on our personal experiences.

490
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:48,511
We'll be sure to send you the dvds.

491
00:33:50,425 --> 00:33:52,187
Porn's for fat kids.

492
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,915
Why not offer him the real thing?

493
00:34:04,265 --> 00:34:05,601
I--I wouldn't want to impose.

494
00:34:06,493 --> 00:34:09,093
Christian won't mind a friend lending a hand.

495
00:34:09,529 --> 00:34:10,496
Not at all.

496
00:34:10,687 --> 00:34:13,394
Quentin, if that's what Kit wants,

497
00:34:14,065 --> 00:34:15,519
she's all yours.

498
00:34:26,156 --> 00:34:29,983
If you like her movies, wait 'til you have her when she's not acting.

499
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,215
She tastes like home maple syrup.

500
00:34:32,308 --> 00:34:34,631
Kimber isn't a condiment from ihop, sweetheart.

501
00:34:34,693 --> 00:34:36,942
She's not to be passed around the table.

502
00:34:38,994 --> 00:34:44,329
It's not your place to invite him into our arrangement, Kit.

503
00:34:44,774 --> 00:34:46,249
You're right, Christian.

504
00:34:46,818 --> 00:34:48,394
We need a majority.

505
00:34:48,908 --> 00:34:52,208
Would you like us to make love to Quentin tonight, baby?

506
00:34:55,651 --> 00:34:56,704
Sure.

507
00:34:57,340 --> 00:34:58,456
Why not?

508
00:35:01,057 --> 00:35:02,592
Then it's decided.

509
00:35:03,514 --> 00:35:06,227
Unless you're uncomfortable, Christian.

510
00:35:06,452 --> 00:35:07,829
Or intimidated.

511
00:35:15,469 --> 00:35:17,962
Baby, don't worry.

512
00:35:18,039 --> 00:35:22,940
If he's taking care of her, then I can have you all to myself again.

513
00:35:30,542 --> 00:35:34,663
To, um, even numbers.

514
00:36:11,197 --> 00:36:12,103
Hello?

515
00:36:12,179 --> 00:36:13,207
Is Matt there?

516
00:36:13,284 --> 00:36:14,677
No, what's wrong?

517
00:36:14,749 --> 00:36:18,568
What's wrong is that our son has polished off our entire liquor cabinet.

518
00:36:18,743 --> 00:36:20,227
How do you know it was him?

519
00:36:20,305 --> 00:36:22,833
Right, Julia, I shouldn't assume.

520
00:36:23,023 --> 00:36:26,381
Maybe the booze elves had a big blowout while I was at work!

521
00:36:26,463 --> 00:36:29,801
Oh, Jesus, he knows he's not supposed to be drinking.

522
00:36:29,883 --> 00:36:32,208
If Matt shows up there, tell him I expect him

523
00:36:32,281 --> 00:36:35,461
and you and Christian over here tomorrow night to settle this.

524
00:37:44,869 --> 00:37:46,295
What's wrong?

525
00:37:46,977 --> 00:37:49,071
Tell me that was an accident, Quentin.

526
00:37:49,660 --> 00:37:51,032
Relax, Christian.

527
00:37:51,488 --> 00:37:52,675
We're all just having a good time.

528
00:37:52,747 --> 00:37:54,831
No, I need to hear him say it.

529
00:37:54,898 --> 00:37:58,031
I need to hear him say that he did not mean to grab my ass.

530
00:37:59,388 --> 00:38:00,898
I think I should go.

531
00:38:12,949 --> 00:38:15,536
Why didn't you tell me that you were bi?

532
00:38:16,864 --> 00:38:21,005
You didn't tell me the specifics of your sex life until this afternoon.

533
00:38:21,230 --> 00:38:24,480
Frankly, I assumed you were, too.

534
00:38:26,525 --> 00:38:27,676
Well, I'm not.

535
00:38:31,290 --> 00:38:33,200
Well, this is my fault.

536
00:38:33,793 --> 00:38:35,234
I broke rule number one.

537
00:38:35,913 --> 00:38:38,275
Never cum where you eat.

538
00:38:42,783 --> 00:38:44,383
Thank you for a lovely evening.

539
00:38:45,094 --> 00:38:46,600
You're both incredible.

540
00:38:55,007 --> 00:38:56,641
Well then, Christian.

541
00:38:56,951 --> 00:38:58,284
Get out of my bed.

542
00:38:58,326 --> 00:38:59,179
Excuse me?

543
00:38:59,259 --> 00:39:01,135
I'm tired of all this 3-way bullshit.

544
00:39:01,207 --> 00:39:02,574
I want my girlfriend back.

545
00:39:02,642 --> 00:39:03,582
She's mine.

546
00:39:03,670 --> 00:39:07,899
Kimber isn't a possession, Christian. She doesn't belong to you.

547
00:39:08,406 --> 00:39:09,794
Yes, I do.

548
00:39:14,826 --> 00:39:16,701
You're beautiful,

549
00:39:16,931 --> 00:39:19,071
and you're really amazing, Kit,

550
00:39:19,132 --> 00:39:23,607
but I agreed to let you join us because I thought it would help make Christian feel better.

551
00:39:25,850 --> 00:39:30,525
Now he does. I like you, but I love him.

552
00:39:37,918 --> 00:39:41,000
I had higher expectations of you, Christian,

553
00:39:41,261 --> 00:39:44,845
but the truth is, you're nothing more than a domesticated house cat

554
00:39:44,917 --> 00:39:47,543
with an expensive haircut and no sense of adventure.

555
00:39:47,625 --> 00:39:51,235
Domesticated or not, there's no pussy for you here.

556
00:39:51,706 --> 00:39:54,220
Go find one someplace else.

557
00:39:59,602 --> 00:40:02,694
You'll never feel truly safe with him, Kimber.

558
00:40:31,791 --> 00:40:34,018
Matt will be at my house at 7:00.

559
00:40:34,205 --> 00:40:35,507
I'll get takeout.

560
00:40:36,070 --> 00:40:37,935
Don't order for me. I won't be there.

561
00:40:38,765 --> 00:40:40,316
This is important, Christian.

562
00:40:40,324 --> 00:40:42,195
Which is why he needs his parents there.

563
00:40:42,332 --> 00:40:43,838
His real parents.

564
00:40:45,958 --> 00:40:48,344
What happened to Mr. Hands-on dad?

565
00:40:55,359 --> 00:40:56,901
Threes don't work.

566
00:40:57,671 --> 00:41:01,212
Some old customs are still around for good reason.

567
00:41:02,388 --> 00:41:05,732
One wife, one husband, two parents.

568
00:41:07,124 --> 00:41:09,069
It would help us to have you there.

569
00:41:09,295 --> 00:41:12,311
He respects your opinion more than any of ours right now.

570
00:41:17,472 --> 00:41:19,888
I've got an 8:30 lift with Quentin.

571
00:41:19,955 --> 00:41:21,727
Make sure you don't drop the scalpel.

572
00:41:23,115 --> 00:41:26,151
Our new partner... plays for both teams.

573
00:41:26,162 --> 00:41:27,313
- You're joking.
- Mm-hmm.

574
00:41:27,385 --> 00:41:28,366
How do you know?

575
00:41:28,454 --> 00:41:30,128
He made a pass at me last night.

576
00:41:30,764 --> 00:41:32,438
You sure it was a pass?

577
00:41:32,542 --> 00:41:34,153
Could you have misconstrued something?

578
00:41:34,203 --> 00:41:37,901
I've never had a buddy try to snake his pinkie up my ass just for shits and giggles.

579
00:41:37,968 --> 00:41:41,269
I knew there was something weird about the way he was looking at me at that party.

580
00:41:41,398 --> 00:41:44,731
Makes sense. I think he's got a little man-crush on you.

581
00:41:44,787 --> 00:41:46,928
On me?! You're the one he tried to screw.

582
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:50,834
Somebody tell a good joke?

583
00:41:52,222 --> 00:41:56,974
No, just something I saw in the paper this morning.

584
00:41:57,050 --> 00:42:01,101
Oh. It must have been a pretty funny article.

585
00:42:01,949 --> 00:42:03,440
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

586
00:42:05,605 --> 00:42:06,938
Uh, hey...

587
00:42:09,225 --> 00:42:13,441
did either of you read the article last week about

588
00:42:13,655 --> 00:42:19,250
the Ohio state supreme court ruling that upheld a $6 million award

589
00:42:19,354 --> 00:42:23,695
to a bisexual woman who accused the law offices where she was clerking

590
00:42:23,756 --> 00:42:27,181
of turning her sexual practices into water cooler gossip?

591
00:42:28,876 --> 00:42:30,735
It was a landmark case.

592
00:42:34,334 --> 00:42:35,793
$6 million.

593
00:42:36,060 --> 00:42:38,681
That sets a motherlode of a precedent, eh?

594
00:42:39,089 --> 00:42:40,779
Basically shut the firm down.

595
00:42:45,203 --> 00:42:46,566
See you in surgery.

596
00:43:02,511 --> 00:43:04,516
Oh, god.

597
00:43:07,665 --> 00:43:12,335
Matt, where have you been? You were supposed to be here 2 hours ago.

598
00:43:12,412 --> 00:43:14,767
Oh, I must have lost track of time.

599
00:43:14,874 --> 00:43:16,210
Mattie, this is serious.

600
00:43:16,287 --> 00:43:19,216
Oh, I'm sure it is, man, but, uh, my face is killing me,

601
00:43:19,272 --> 00:43:22,554
so maybe we can get together at the dysfunctional family Christmas party, huh?

602
00:43:22,605 --> 00:43:23,783
That's enough, Matt.

603
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:26,968
Have you been drinking again?

604
00:43:27,638 --> 00:43:30,204
Yeah, just a couple of beers.

605
00:43:30,670 --> 00:43:32,149
Who are you?

606
00:43:33,025 --> 00:43:35,679
I don't even recognize you anymore.

607
00:43:35,922 --> 00:43:40,209
That's funny because you all look so familiar to me.

608
00:43:40,295 --> 00:43:44,422
Everything out of your mouth is some kind of snide, smartass comment.

609
00:43:45,082 --> 00:43:46,481
What's happened to you?

610
00:43:46,577 --> 00:43:49,818
Well, uh, let's see.

611
00:43:49,890 --> 00:43:55,619
In the past couple of months, I found out that my dad's best friend is my real dad,

612
00:43:55,686 --> 00:44:00,023
my old dad beat the crap out of my mom and threw her out of the house,

613
00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:05,271
my parents ruined my relationship with the only woman I've ever loved

614
00:44:05,327 --> 00:44:09,511
and then let it slip that not only was she a man,

615
00:44:09,925 --> 00:44:12,388
but that one of them slept with her.

616
00:44:13,694 --> 00:44:15,225
Is that enough?

617
00:44:15,465 --> 00:44:16,658
Or should I go on?

618
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:19,980
We understand, Matt, and that's why we've called this meeting

619
00:44:20,042 --> 00:44:23,437
to talk through your feelings about everything that's happened.

620
00:44:23,503 --> 00:44:27,508
We know we screwed the pooch. This is our chance to make it right.

621
00:44:27,702 --> 00:44:29,632
To be a family again.

622
00:44:30,626 --> 00:44:33,647
You want a family? You find someone sick enough to want one with you.

623
00:44:33,718 --> 00:44:36,632
Listen, you think you're a man?

624
00:44:36,730 --> 00:44:38,413
You want to hear it like a man?

625
00:44:38,515 --> 00:44:41,403
Your mother and I sacrificed everything for you.

626
00:44:41,507 --> 00:44:44,163
She buried her dreams and I sold my soul to that business

627
00:44:44,215 --> 00:44:46,590
so that we could provide you with the things we didn't have.

628
00:44:46,652 --> 00:44:48,648
Don't tell me we've turned you into this!

629
00:44:48,715 --> 00:44:52,775
We've given our lives for this family! You don't have the right to walk out on it!

630
00:44:56,738 --> 00:44:57,804
Watch me.

631
00:45:00,951 --> 00:45:03,537
Mattie, please-- oh, God!

632
00:45:07,209 --> 00:45:08,361
No!

633
00:45:08,648 --> 00:45:11,078
You wouldn't dare mess up your perfect work.

634
00:45:11,105 --> 00:45:12,630
I already have.

635
00:45:13,435 --> 00:45:14,234
Oh!

636
00:45:16,732 --> 00:45:18,114
Oh, my god!

637
00:45:18,487 --> 00:45:19,840
Oh, my god!

638
00:45:21,284 --> 00:45:22,251
Aah!
