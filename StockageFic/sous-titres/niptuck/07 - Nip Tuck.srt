00:00:02,387 --> 00:00:03,911
<i>Previously on</i> Nip / Tuck:

2
00:00:03,988 --> 00:00:05,512
This is my husband, Sean.

3
00:00:05,590 --> 00:00:08,184
It's a pleasure to meet you.
I've heard a lot about you.

4
00:00:08,259 --> 00:00:10,022
I've heard absolutely nothing about you.

5
00:00:12,463 --> 00:00:16,456
Don't for one second feeI ashamed
about these scars on your chest.

6
00:00:16,534 --> 00:00:20,026
<i>You're just wearing on the outside</i>
<i>what the rest of us wear on the inside.</i>

7
00:00:20,104 --> 00:00:24,165
Christian! I'm so glad you're here.

8
00:00:24,242 --> 00:00:26,233
Look at you, sweetheart. You're an 1 1 .

9
00:00:26,711 --> 00:00:28,906
You're proposing a three-way?

10
00:00:29,247 --> 00:00:30,305
Yes.

11
00:00:30,381 --> 00:00:32,679
Take off your clothes, Matthew.

12
00:01:01,212 --> 00:01:04,045
-Need a ride?
-I don't ride for free, honey.

13
00:01:04,882 --> 00:01:08,579
But maybe l'll make an exception
for a pretty boy like you.

14
00:01:24,435 --> 00:01:25,697
This car!

15
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:29,005
What are you doing?
A hooker wouldn't say that.

16
00:01:29,574 --> 00:01:31,974
I'm a model. I'm not an actress.

17
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:34,175
This is totally uncomfortable.

18
00:01:34,245 --> 00:01:35,610
Everything is a drama with you.

19
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,614
I'm trying to make this relationship work.

20
00:01:37,682 --> 00:01:39,081
And I'm not?

21
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:41,584
I'm the one
with candle-wax burns on her ass...

22
00:01:41,653 --> 00:01:44,713
standing out on a street corner
with her tits hanging out.

23
00:01:44,789 --> 00:01:48,555
I bust my butt to fulfill
every sexuaI desire you have.

24
00:01:48,626 --> 00:01:51,220
I want a little goddamn appreciation.

25
00:02:28,366 --> 00:02:29,560
Get in.

26
00:03:26,858 --> 00:03:30,123
Mr. Mantegna, tell me
what you don't like about yourself.

27
00:03:30,194 --> 00:03:32,059
That would be my tits.

28
00:03:33,197 --> 00:03:36,291
I work out six times a week.
I hit my pecs twice.

29
00:03:36,601 --> 00:03:39,627
Running, swimming, yoga.

30
00:03:39,904 --> 00:03:41,599
I do the Zone delivery thing.

31
00:03:41,672 --> 00:03:43,765
But I still can't seem...

32
00:03:43,841 --> 00:03:46,366
to shake these hairy mouthfuls.

33
00:03:48,713 --> 00:03:51,807
The gynecomastia procedure
you need to fix those...

34
00:03:51,883 --> 00:03:53,578
is extremely painful.

35
00:03:53,651 --> 00:03:56,620
You'd have to wear a bra-like
apparatus for six to eight weeks.

36
00:03:56,687 --> 00:03:59,781
What's six weeks after a lifetime
of titty jokes and rejection?

37
00:03:59,857 --> 00:04:02,382
Are you doing this
because you were rejected by a woman?

38
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:03,552
One woman?

39
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:07,760
Try 30. ln one night.

40
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:13,364
This isn't about a particular woman,
Dr. Troy. This is about my lifestyle.

41
00:04:13,604 --> 00:04:15,094
I'm a swinger.

42
00:04:15,606 --> 00:04:18,074
The problem is,
swinging is like anything else in life.

43
00:04:18,142 --> 00:04:20,906
It's a class system.
And I'm looking to move up.

44
00:04:21,479 --> 00:04:24,607
You know, get involved
with a higher class of people.

45
00:04:24,682 --> 00:04:28,948
I'm sick of banging fat German chicks
in front of their pasty husbands.

46
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:30,817
We've all been there.

47
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:35,322
Have you ever heard of The Scene?

48
00:04:35,393 --> 00:04:36,792
The Scene?

49
00:04:37,328 --> 00:04:40,263
It's the greatest swingers party of all time.

50
00:04:40,531 --> 00:04:44,126
We're talking supermodels,
actors, flawless talent.

51
00:04:44,202 --> 00:04:46,966
They started throwing it
twice a month in L.A. last year...

52
00:04:47,038 --> 00:04:51,031
and it was so popular
that now they're starting one up in Miami.

53
00:04:51,108 --> 00:04:53,736
I have to get in. It's an event.

54
00:04:55,546 --> 00:04:56,706
The problem is...

55
00:04:56,781 --> 00:05:00,376
that you have to submit a full body shot
to the governing committee...

56
00:05:00,451 --> 00:05:02,646
to get an invite, and mine got bounced...

57
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,416
for undisclosed reasons.

58
00:05:06,791 --> 00:05:10,227
I bet a guy like you
would have no trouble getting in.

59
00:05:10,962 --> 00:05:13,624
Cheer up, Mr. Mantegna.
When we're done with you...

60
00:05:13,698 --> 00:05:17,657
the only tits you'll be feeling up
are gonna belong to Hooters girls.

61
00:05:24,075 --> 00:05:26,475
I'm not bothering
with the Harvard application.

62
00:05:26,544 --> 00:05:29,672
Who needs those New England winters
when the University of Miami...

63
00:05:29,747 --> 00:05:33,649
provides year-round thong bikinis
just minutes from the campus?

64
00:05:33,851 --> 00:05:36,843
I think I missed
that section of the brochure.

65
00:05:37,521 --> 00:05:39,716
God, this place is beautiful.

66
00:05:40,191 --> 00:05:43,092
How can you afford it
on a personaI trainer's salary?

67
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,320
You're kidding me, right?

68
00:05:44,395 --> 00:05:48,092
I make $200 an hour
from some of my clients. Voilà !

69
00:05:49,767 --> 00:05:52,258
And now, <i>la touche finale.</i>

70
00:06:12,623 --> 00:06:13,885
You like?

71
00:06:14,592 --> 00:06:17,117
Good. Because there's something
I want to ask you.

72
00:06:17,194 --> 00:06:19,856
It's a big deaI for me,
but l'll totally understand...

73
00:06:19,931 --> 00:06:21,831
if you said no.

74
00:06:22,333 --> 00:06:25,461
You know those moments in life
where everything just opens up?

75
00:06:25,536 --> 00:06:27,026
TotaI clarity.

76
00:06:27,505 --> 00:06:30,303
I had one of those moments
the last time we were together...

77
00:06:30,374 --> 00:06:31,841
at your house.

78
00:06:31,909 --> 00:06:35,902
I looked at you, looked at your life,
and realized something.

79
00:06:39,016 --> 00:06:41,314
I wanna be a plastic surgeon.

80
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:44,647
But I can't do it without you.

81
00:06:44,722 --> 00:06:46,986
Miami has a speciaI program
that fast-tracks you...

82
00:06:47,058 --> 00:06:50,255
into a plastic-surgery residency
as soon as you're out of school...

83
00:06:50,328 --> 00:06:53,058
but the catch is,
they need a year-long internship...

84
00:06:53,130 --> 00:06:55,564
with a surgeon in order to get in.

85
00:06:57,335 --> 00:06:59,633
You wanna work with my husband?

86
00:06:59,704 --> 00:07:01,968
Would that be a problem for you?

87
00:07:02,039 --> 00:07:04,064
No. Not at all.

88
00:07:04,875 --> 00:07:06,570
I can ask.

89
00:07:07,144 --> 00:07:09,977
Sean can be a little funny
about the business.

90
00:07:10,614 --> 00:07:13,378
So I can't guarantee anything.

91
00:07:13,818 --> 00:07:16,548
Of course you can. Who'd say no to you?

92
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:21,783
I forgot something.

93
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:24,555
The whipped cream.

94
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:57,291
You like?

95
00:08:01,132 --> 00:08:02,599
They're lovely.

96
00:08:03,834 --> 00:08:06,268
So are you gonna do some modeling?

97
00:08:07,038 --> 00:08:09,632
God knows you're good-looking enough.

98
00:08:11,842 --> 00:08:13,935
Thank you, but....

99
00:08:15,379 --> 00:08:17,711
No, they're for something else.

100
00:08:40,838 --> 00:08:41,896
Yeah?

101
00:08:41,972 --> 00:08:44,907
Linda, can you void the billing
on this case?

102
00:08:45,376 --> 00:08:47,367
Megan O'Hara? Which one's she?

103
00:08:47,445 --> 00:08:50,141
She backed out of a breast
reconstruction a few weeks ago.

104
00:08:50,214 --> 00:08:53,650
Policy says I still have to bill her
for her pre-op and lab work anyway.

105
00:08:53,717 --> 00:08:57,016
I know what policy is.
I wrote the policy. Just do it.

106
00:09:01,025 --> 00:09:02,993
What was that all about?

107
00:09:03,461 --> 00:09:06,328
-ls everything all right?
-Everything's fine.

108
00:09:07,064 --> 00:09:08,964
I was just driving by Rascals...

109
00:09:09,033 --> 00:09:12,560
and I know how you've been jonesing
for a Reuben for weeks.

110
00:09:14,004 --> 00:09:16,199
Are you sure that's a Reuben?

111
00:09:17,775 --> 00:09:19,436
Smells more like a bribe to me.

112
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:22,377
Can't a woman just do something nice
for her husband?

113
00:09:22,446 --> 00:09:25,813
A woman can definitely
do something nice for her husband.

114
00:09:25,883 --> 00:09:28,078
You driving 20 minutes
to bring me lunch...

115
00:09:28,152 --> 00:09:30,017
sounds like a woman
who wants her husband...

116
00:09:30,087 --> 00:09:31,987
to do something nice for her.

117
00:09:32,056 --> 00:09:34,957
All right. I need a favor.

118
00:09:37,728 --> 00:09:40,925
I want you to take
my friend Jude on as an intern.

119
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:44,759
I know you're not fond of him--

120
00:09:44,835 --> 00:09:47,269
I never said I wasn't fond of him.

121
00:09:50,107 --> 00:09:53,941
I'm just gonna have to ask Christian
before we take anyone on.

122
00:09:54,645 --> 00:09:57,307
Will you? I mean,
all you have to let him do...

123
00:09:57,381 --> 00:10:00,077
is make lunch runs, clean the O.R....

124
00:10:02,953 --> 00:10:06,013
Actually, I've always wanted
to mentor someone.

125
00:10:26,043 --> 00:10:29,501
Hello, Dr. Troy.
Can I take your temperature?

126
00:10:31,916 --> 00:10:33,008
What?

127
00:10:35,953 --> 00:10:38,649
-I thought you'd like it.
-I do.

128
00:10:39,823 --> 00:10:41,256
You don't.

129
00:10:41,692 --> 00:10:43,751
I spent $400 on this.

130
00:10:43,827 --> 00:10:47,524
I'm just trying to do what you wanted
and spice things up.

131
00:10:47,598 --> 00:10:49,327
Here's the dilemma.

132
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,898
You think a jockey wants
to see his girlfriend...

133
00:10:51,969 --> 00:10:53,698
dressed like a horse?

134
00:10:53,971 --> 00:10:56,599
I'm around nurses all day, sweetheart.

135
00:10:56,774 --> 00:11:00,210
lf I wanted to screw one of them,
I would have by now.

136
00:11:01,478 --> 00:11:03,503
You wanna spice things up?

137
00:11:05,449 --> 00:11:07,246
What are we gonna do?

138
00:11:11,422 --> 00:11:14,323
We're gonna do
what you do best, sweetheart.

139
00:11:15,259 --> 00:11:17,454
We're gonna take some pictures.

140
00:11:26,370 --> 00:11:27,803
Really sexy.

141
00:11:30,107 --> 00:11:32,337
What's my motivation in these?

142
00:11:35,079 --> 00:11:36,603
To get us laid.

143
00:11:37,248 --> 00:11:39,273
You ever hear of something
called The Scene?

144
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:40,840
The sex party.

145
00:11:40,918 --> 00:11:44,547
One of the girls at the Tampax shoot
was talking about it.

146
00:11:47,625 --> 00:11:49,923
But don't we have to
sleep with other people...

147
00:11:49,994 --> 00:11:52,019
to go to something like that?

148
00:11:53,364 --> 00:11:56,094
-Aren't I enough?
-You're plenty, baby.

149
00:11:56,934 --> 00:11:59,801
I'm just looking to
put some frosting on our cake.

150
00:12:00,704 --> 00:12:03,764
We don't have to do anything
we don't wanna do.

151
00:12:29,233 --> 00:12:30,723
What the hell?

152
00:12:30,801 --> 00:12:32,393
What the hell....

153
00:12:37,241 --> 00:12:38,799
Mom, this isn't a big deal.

154
00:12:38,876 --> 00:12:42,505
Having three-way sex in my house
is a very big deal, Matt.

155
00:12:42,579 --> 00:12:45,377
You guys are lucky that
that was all I was doing.

156
00:12:45,449 --> 00:12:48,009
I know kids hooked on crank...

157
00:12:48,085 --> 00:12:50,110
kids who are plotting
to blow up the school.

158
00:12:50,187 --> 00:12:53,452
Congratulations. You win the award
for least screwed-up teenager.

159
00:12:53,524 --> 00:12:55,788
You guys are sending me mixed messages.

160
00:12:55,859 --> 00:12:57,827
I mean, how can Dad give me a condom...

161
00:12:57,895 --> 00:13:00,864
and then expect me
not to have sex in my own room?

162
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,934
You gave him a condom?

163
00:13:05,836 --> 00:13:07,599
I just wanted him to be safe.

164
00:13:07,671 --> 00:13:09,434
And you didn't discuss it with me?

165
00:13:09,506 --> 00:13:12,498
I didn't think we had to discuss
everything I say to my own son.

166
00:13:12,576 --> 00:13:15,044
When it comes to his sex life, you do.

167
00:13:15,112 --> 00:13:17,808
Yeah, and you wonder
why I'm having threesomes...

168
00:13:17,881 --> 00:13:21,373
when you two are such a fine example
of traditionaI coupling.

169
00:13:21,919 --> 00:13:23,614
Go to your room.

170
00:13:28,325 --> 00:13:30,293
And don't slam the door.

171
00:13:35,833 --> 00:13:38,825
Now I see how you can be
so nonchalant about this.

172
00:13:38,902 --> 00:13:40,369
You've been encouraging it.

173
00:13:40,437 --> 00:13:44,396
All I've been encouraging, Julia,
is a relationship with my son.

174
00:13:46,977 --> 00:13:49,445
He's just started to trust me
and communicate with me.

175
00:13:49,513 --> 00:13:52,641
I don't wanna throw all that away
over something as small as this.

176
00:13:52,716 --> 00:13:53,876
Small!

177
00:13:54,118 --> 00:13:58,612
A 16-year-old having a three-way
is about as big as it gets!

178
00:13:58,922 --> 00:14:00,116
This is the problem.

179
00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:02,158
You tell me to be a more involved parent...

180
00:14:02,226 --> 00:14:03,818
then judge me for the choices I make.

181
00:14:03,894 --> 00:14:06,021
No one is judging you, Sean.

182
00:14:06,163 --> 00:14:08,529
I just need you to understand that...

183
00:14:08,599 --> 00:14:10,863
the choices and the attitudes
that you have...

184
00:14:10,934 --> 00:14:13,903
are gonna have reaI implications
in the lives of our kids.

185
00:14:13,971 --> 00:14:15,700
What are you doing?

186
00:14:15,806 --> 00:14:18,138
I'm calling those girls' parents.

187
00:14:18,208 --> 00:14:19,766
We're all gonna sit down...

188
00:14:19,843 --> 00:14:21,970
and we're gonna
have a conversation about this.

189
00:14:22,045 --> 00:14:23,876
A sexuaI intervention?

190
00:14:24,248 --> 00:14:26,182
All that's gonna do is humiliate him.

191
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:28,548
You can't just be the good guy, Sean.

192
00:14:28,619 --> 00:14:31,315
Handing out prophylactics...

193
00:14:31,388 --> 00:14:34,186
and slapping him on the back
for his conquests.

194
00:14:34,558 --> 00:14:37,459
Welcome to the wonderfuI world
of parenting.

195
00:14:46,236 --> 00:14:48,363
Part of me agrees with Julia.

196
00:14:48,439 --> 00:14:50,600
The other part is saying,
''Way to go, Matt.''

197
00:14:50,674 --> 00:14:53,040
We all want more for our children
than we had.

198
00:14:53,110 --> 00:14:55,237
He never mentioned
anything about this to you?

199
00:14:55,312 --> 00:14:56,973
No. Of course not.

200
00:15:00,017 --> 00:15:01,507
You all right?

201
00:15:02,085 --> 00:15:05,452
My neck seized up this morning.
Must have slept funny.

202
00:15:05,522 --> 00:15:09,117
Twenty milligrams of Vicodin
and a blowjob will clear that right up.

203
00:15:09,193 --> 00:15:11,923
lf drug abuse isn't your thing,
why not try a chiropractor?

204
00:15:11,995 --> 00:15:15,761
Wasn't that patient we treated
a few weeks ago a back-cracker?

205
00:15:15,833 --> 00:15:17,130
Which one?

206
00:15:17,201 --> 00:15:19,294
Sexy curls. Double mastectomy.

207
00:15:19,369 --> 00:15:21,735
You and she seemed to really hit it off.

208
00:15:26,543 --> 00:15:28,773
Right. I think I remember her.

209
00:15:30,347 --> 00:15:32,975
Maybe l'll try and see her after work.

210
00:15:34,651 --> 00:15:35,982
Shit, I forgot.

211
00:15:36,053 --> 00:15:38,385
Julia wants to have
some kind of family meeting...

212
00:15:38,455 --> 00:15:40,013
with those girls' parents tonight.

213
00:15:40,090 --> 00:15:43,184
Can you take the consult
with Schiraldi this afternoon?

214
00:15:45,095 --> 00:15:47,120
God, I wish I was single sometimes.

215
00:15:47,197 --> 00:15:49,392
You know the saying:
''For every beautifuI woman...

216
00:15:49,466 --> 00:15:52,367
''there's a guy
who is tired of screwing her.''

217
00:16:09,987 --> 00:16:11,852
Four-millimeter cannula?

218
00:16:11,922 --> 00:16:13,082
Three.

219
00:16:13,657 --> 00:16:14,988
Thank you.

220
00:16:18,362 --> 00:16:21,798
Do you have any feelings
about taking on a college intern?

221
00:16:21,865 --> 00:16:23,355
What's she look like?

222
00:16:23,433 --> 00:16:26,061
He is a friend of Julia's from school.

223
00:16:26,370 --> 00:16:27,928
Jude something.

224
00:16:28,238 --> 00:16:29,899
I could use the points.

225
00:16:29,973 --> 00:16:33,807
She's pissed that I'm not
outraged enough about Matt's three-way.

226
00:16:33,877 --> 00:16:35,435
All right with me, partner.

227
00:16:35,512 --> 00:16:38,310
l'd rather have the kid
hanging around here, than sitting...

228
00:16:38,382 --> 00:16:41,112
shirtless by your pool
feeding the wife margaritas.

229
00:17:01,371 --> 00:17:03,066
Hi, I'm Jude.

230
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,067
Vivian Schiraldi.

231
00:17:05,375 --> 00:17:07,639
You're not here
to get anything done, are you?

232
00:17:07,711 --> 00:17:10,703
Because you certainly are
the after picture.

233
00:17:13,150 --> 00:17:15,641
I'm here to have my eyes looked at.

234
00:17:16,286 --> 00:17:18,777
This isn't an optometrist's office.

235
00:17:20,624 --> 00:17:23,058
The wrinkles around my eyes.

236
00:17:23,527 --> 00:17:26,690
I've tried the expensive creams.
Nothing's working.

237
00:17:26,763 --> 00:17:28,822
It's barely noticeable.

238
00:17:30,767 --> 00:17:31,995
Really.

239
00:17:35,539 --> 00:17:37,131
Unless you're up close.

240
00:17:37,407 --> 00:17:39,932
It's my post-divorce gift to myself.

241
00:17:44,014 --> 00:17:45,106
What?

242
00:17:46,049 --> 00:17:49,314
You're a knockout. You really are.
You don't need anything done.

243
00:17:49,386 --> 00:17:51,946
But since you're getting
your eyes done anyway...

244
00:17:52,022 --> 00:17:55,719
I think your ears are a little off balance.
A millimeter at the most.

245
00:17:57,394 --> 00:17:59,726
Balance takes off years.

246
00:18:00,030 --> 00:18:01,588
Mrs. Schiraldi.

247
00:18:02,232 --> 00:18:04,166
-I'm Dr. Troy.
-Hello.

248
00:18:04,234 --> 00:18:08,796
lf you'll just step down the hall,
my office is the first door on the left.

249
00:18:12,809 --> 00:18:15,778
Jude Sawyer.
Dr. McNamara told me to come by.

250
00:18:15,846 --> 00:18:19,077
You worked her pretty good.
Got a thing for hot middle-aged moms?

251
00:18:19,149 --> 00:18:21,049
Only if they've got a thing for me.

252
00:18:21,118 --> 00:18:24,383
-You're here to intern, right?
-That was the plan, yes.

253
00:18:24,888 --> 00:18:28,085
Take it to the Biscayne Wash
on 15th. Talk to a guy named Zook.

254
00:18:28,158 --> 00:18:31,321
Have it back by 3:00,
and no eating in the ride.

255
00:18:32,863 --> 00:18:34,387
By the way...

256
00:18:34,464 --> 00:18:36,989
you were off about Mrs. Schiraldi's ears...

257
00:18:37,067 --> 00:18:38,796
by two millimeters.

258
00:18:42,773 --> 00:18:44,934
My partner actually
brought your name up...

259
00:18:45,008 --> 00:18:47,067
this morning when he saw my neck.

260
00:18:47,144 --> 00:18:49,612
l'd totally forgotten
you were a chiropractor.

261
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:52,945
You should thank him.
You're all out of whack.

262
00:18:53,116 --> 00:18:55,414
Something new going on at home?

263
00:18:55,552 --> 00:18:56,883
Let's see.

264
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:00,317
My son's sex life
belongs in a Penthouse letter.

265
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:03,957
And my wife seems to have
turned on me because of it.

266
00:19:04,161 --> 00:19:06,152
Besides that, things--

267
00:19:07,664 --> 00:19:09,188
That's not where it hurts.

268
00:19:09,266 --> 00:19:12,633
Everything's connected.
You should know that, Doctor.

269
00:19:12,703 --> 00:19:16,833
lnjuries and tension
aren't caused by externaI events.

270
00:19:17,174 --> 00:19:19,438
They're caused by how you react to them.

271
00:19:19,509 --> 00:19:22,603
I'm really trying
to be open-minded and flexible.

272
00:19:22,679 --> 00:19:25,409
Being open-minded isn't a cure-all, Sean.

273
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:28,911
You can't just examine the situation...

274
00:19:28,985 --> 00:19:31,453
decide what the appropriate
open-minded response...

275
00:19:31,521 --> 00:19:33,955
is supposed to be,
and then follow through.

276
00:19:34,024 --> 00:19:36,652
Especially if that's not
what your heart is telling you...

277
00:19:36,727 --> 00:19:38,718
is the right thing to do.

278
00:19:38,929 --> 00:19:41,989
Your neck isn't spasming
because you're inflexible.

279
00:19:42,065 --> 00:19:46,399
Your neck is spasming because
you're not being honest with who you are.

280
00:19:47,437 --> 00:19:51,168
According to everyone in my life,
who I am is a rigid prick.

281
00:19:51,575 --> 00:19:53,372
Don't judge yourself.

282
00:19:53,577 --> 00:19:56,410
When you want water, a rock is useless.

283
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:59,176
But it's the best thing in the world
when you wanna keep...

284
00:19:59,249 --> 00:20:01,774
something important from flying away.

285
00:20:02,352 --> 00:20:03,717
I'm a rock.

286
00:20:06,356 --> 00:20:09,154
Now roll over, and l'll open that neck up.

287
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:18,897
I just need a second.

288
00:20:52,636 --> 00:20:54,866
I should go. I'm really sorry.

289
00:20:58,441 --> 00:21:01,001
Sean, it's all right. lt happens.

290
00:21:02,512 --> 00:21:05,504
Look, it was unprofessionaI of me
to start working on you...

291
00:21:05,582 --> 00:21:08,642
without talking about
what happened between us.

292
00:21:08,718 --> 00:21:11,653
I'm glad it happened.
I'm not upset about it.

293
00:21:12,889 --> 00:21:15,551
We were both feeling lonely,
and for that moment...

294
00:21:15,625 --> 00:21:18,423
coming together
made that feeling go away.

295
00:21:20,163 --> 00:21:24,600
But now, that moment is gone.

296
00:21:26,837 --> 00:21:28,361
lt has to be gone.

297
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,369
Good. I'm glad.

298
00:21:32,876 --> 00:21:36,277
I was worried you thought
it was more than it was.

299
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:39,175
Can I see you again?

300
00:21:39,249 --> 00:21:40,944
On a professionaI basis?

301
00:21:41,017 --> 00:21:42,211
Please.

302
00:21:42,652 --> 00:21:45,485
That swelling isn't going away on its own.

303
00:21:48,625 --> 00:21:49,717
Yeah.

304
00:21:52,229 --> 00:21:53,321
Look...

305
00:21:53,897 --> 00:21:56,661
try to be honest
with your feelings untiI then...

306
00:21:57,067 --> 00:21:58,864
no matter what they are.

307
00:22:05,242 --> 00:22:08,143
Would now be the right time
to break out the cyanide Kool-Aid?

308
00:22:08,211 --> 00:22:10,611
I really need your support tonight, Sean.

309
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:12,170
You've got it.

310
00:22:18,855 --> 00:22:20,982
Can we start this thing now?

311
00:22:21,458 --> 00:22:23,085
Okay, everybody.

312
00:22:23,293 --> 00:22:26,023
We all know why we're here.

313
00:22:26,096 --> 00:22:28,792
Something a little disturbing
has happened...

314
00:22:28,865 --> 00:22:31,663
and I think we should all
talk about it so that we know...

315
00:22:31,735 --> 00:22:34,033
it won't happen again. Agreed?

316
00:22:38,875 --> 00:22:41,343
This is gonna have to be
a frank conversation.

317
00:22:41,411 --> 00:22:45,245
We have to remember that
we're all adults. We've all had sex.

318
00:22:45,916 --> 00:22:48,714
Otherwise, none of you kids
would be here.

319
00:22:52,522 --> 00:22:55,218
We just need to remember
to be honest with our feelings...

320
00:22:55,292 --> 00:22:57,260
no matter what they are.

321
00:22:57,961 --> 00:22:59,986
What's the point in talking...

322
00:23:00,397 --> 00:23:03,195
when Mom's already decided
that what we were doing is wrong?

323
00:23:03,266 --> 00:23:04,699
lt was wrong, Matt.

324
00:23:04,768 --> 00:23:08,898
lt had serious consequences that
I don't think you've even considered.

325
00:23:09,272 --> 00:23:12,537
Pregnancy, disease, hurt feelings.

326
00:23:12,609 --> 00:23:16,045
You know, you kids, you think
you're all grown up, but you're not.

327
00:23:16,112 --> 00:23:17,909
I don't see what the big deaI is.

328
00:23:17,981 --> 00:23:21,178
I read this thing in <i>People</i>
about 12-year-olds giving blowjobs...

329
00:23:21,251 --> 00:23:22,775
to their Secret Santas.

330
00:23:22,852 --> 00:23:25,320
This stuff is just kids being kids nowadays.

331
00:23:25,388 --> 00:23:26,980
I'm sorry, Alexi.

332
00:23:27,057 --> 00:23:29,753
Stealing a six-pack is kids being kids.

333
00:23:29,859 --> 00:23:31,690
This is much more than that.

334
00:23:31,761 --> 00:23:33,285
Hold on a minute, Julia.

335
00:23:33,363 --> 00:23:35,263
There was a documentary recently...

336
00:23:35,332 --> 00:23:37,698
where a man named Marilyn Manson
said that...

337
00:23:37,767 --> 00:23:40,292
if he could say anything
to the kids of America...

338
00:23:40,370 --> 00:23:42,895
he wouldn't say a word. He'd listen.

339
00:23:46,643 --> 00:23:49,737
Matt, we obviously don't understand
why you kids did this.

340
00:23:49,813 --> 00:23:51,804
Why don't you try to explain it to us?

341
00:23:51,881 --> 00:23:54,850
I don't want an explanation.
I want him to promise...

342
00:23:54,918 --> 00:23:56,476
that it won't happen again.

343
00:23:56,553 --> 00:23:59,522
An empty promise isn't gonna
get to the source of the problem...

344
00:23:59,589 --> 00:24:00,988
if there is a problem at all.

345
00:24:01,057 --> 00:24:03,389
How can you even look at yourselves
in the mirror...

346
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:05,690
and call what we were doing a problem?

347
00:24:05,762 --> 00:24:08,526
Dad spends one week at home,
the next in a motel.

348
00:24:08,598 --> 00:24:12,034
Mom spends all of her time with
some guy who's barely older than me.

349
00:24:12,102 --> 00:24:13,933
We were having sex...

350
00:24:14,571 --> 00:24:17,472
just like every other teenager
in the world...

351
00:24:17,707 --> 00:24:19,732
with a condom that Dad gave me....

352
00:24:19,809 --> 00:24:22,073
Looks like we found
the source of the problem.

353
00:24:22,145 --> 00:24:24,306
Excuse me, but are you
blaming us for this?

354
00:24:24,381 --> 00:24:26,941
I'm sorry, but whose house
did this happen in?

355
00:24:27,017 --> 00:24:29,508
Ours, Lexi's, or this opium den?

356
00:24:29,586 --> 00:24:32,077
That's only because
my mom's unemployed...

357
00:24:32,155 --> 00:24:34,646
and you guys took all the locks
off Vanessa's doors.

358
00:24:34,724 --> 00:24:37,557
Trust me, honey. Being on alimony
is not being unemployed.

359
00:24:37,627 --> 00:24:39,788
Placing blame
isn't gonna get us anywhere.

360
00:24:39,863 --> 00:24:42,229
Julia is a good parent.
We're all good parents.

361
00:24:42,298 --> 00:24:45,825
Good parents teach their son
how to keep his dick in his pants...

362
00:24:45,902 --> 00:24:48,132
and to be smart enough
not to try to cut it off.

363
00:24:48,204 --> 00:24:50,195
-Daddy!
-Robert, you are out of line.

364
00:24:50,273 --> 00:24:51,535
Fine, I'm sorry.

365
00:24:51,608 --> 00:24:53,906
But to be honest,
I don't care whose fault this is.

366
00:24:53,977 --> 00:24:56,775
l'd rather not know any more
about my daughter's sex life...

367
00:24:56,846 --> 00:24:57,938
than I already do.

368
00:24:58,014 --> 00:25:00,380
She's assured us
that this was a one-time thing...

369
00:25:00,450 --> 00:25:01,712
and we're satisfied with that.

370
00:25:01,785 --> 00:25:04,686
ls this true, Matt?
Was it a one-time thing?

371
00:25:06,456 --> 00:25:08,117
Yeah, pretty much.

372
00:25:08,558 --> 00:25:11,083
Ridley, is this your story as well?

373
00:25:11,928 --> 00:25:13,020
It's okay, honey.

374
00:25:13,096 --> 00:25:15,894
You can be honest here.
No one's gonna get upset.

375
00:25:15,965 --> 00:25:17,830
We've done it before.

376
00:25:17,901 --> 00:25:21,029
I'm sorry, Vanessa. I tried.
What Dr. McNamara said is true.

377
00:25:21,104 --> 00:25:24,631
I have to be honest with my feelings
no matter what they are.

378
00:25:24,707 --> 00:25:27,141
I'm not like you. I'm not a lezzie.

379
00:25:28,511 --> 00:25:29,705
What's a lezzie?

380
00:25:29,779 --> 00:25:31,872
Your daughter likes vagina.

381
00:25:32,816 --> 00:25:34,306
I really like you, Vanessa.

382
00:25:34,384 --> 00:25:37,820
I think you're cool, pretty, sexy, and all...

383
00:25:37,887 --> 00:25:41,618
but I'm in love with Matt now.
We've been seeing each other.

384
00:25:45,495 --> 00:25:47,019
That's not true.

385
00:25:50,066 --> 00:25:51,499
Deny it, Matt.

386
00:26:05,381 --> 00:26:06,905
But I love you.

387
00:26:08,985 --> 00:26:10,509
I've had enough.

388
00:26:13,089 --> 00:26:14,215
Come on.

389
00:26:17,594 --> 00:26:19,892
Open and honest enough for you?

390
00:26:29,939 --> 00:26:32,772
Honestly, am I being
too uptight about this?

391
00:26:32,842 --> 00:26:34,571
For my tastes, yes.

392
00:26:35,145 --> 00:26:37,010
But I've always found...

393
00:26:37,447 --> 00:26:40,678
threesomes to be very satisfying.

394
00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:42,274
You've had one?

395
00:26:42,819 --> 00:26:45,379
Jesus, is there anyone under 30...

396
00:26:45,455 --> 00:26:47,514
who still believes in monogamy?

397
00:26:47,590 --> 00:26:51,617
There's a big difference
between monogamy and fidelity, Jules.

398
00:26:51,694 --> 00:26:53,662
Just look at it from Matt's perspective.

399
00:26:53,730 --> 00:26:56,597
Every guy wants a shot
at two girls at once.

400
00:26:56,666 --> 00:26:58,133
Tell me you've never fantasized...

401
00:26:58,201 --> 00:27:00,795
about being with two men
at the same time.

402
00:27:02,438 --> 00:27:05,100
What are you getting all dolled up for?
A hot date?

403
00:27:05,175 --> 00:27:07,075
You don't want to know.

404
00:27:08,077 --> 00:27:09,942
-Come on.
-No way.

405
00:27:10,013 --> 00:27:13,210
Not after how you reacted
to Matt's little ménage.

406
00:27:13,283 --> 00:27:17,014
I'm not a prude. I just hold my kids
to higher standards.

407
00:27:19,455 --> 00:27:21,116
You know those....

408
00:27:22,725 --> 00:27:24,989
The photos you saw the other day.

409
00:27:25,995 --> 00:27:28,623
-Remind me again.
-The provocative ones.

410
00:27:30,366 --> 00:27:32,527
Well, they were audition shots.

411
00:27:32,602 --> 00:27:34,001
For a party.

412
00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:37,767
What kind of party
do you have to audition for to get into?

413
00:27:37,974 --> 00:27:39,669
A swingers party.

414
00:27:41,211 --> 00:27:43,509
You still feeling open-minded?

415
00:27:43,947 --> 00:27:45,710
No. I mean, yes.

416
00:27:45,782 --> 00:27:47,807
I'm just surprised.

417
00:27:49,452 --> 00:27:53,149
You take such good care of your body.
Aren't you worried about diseases?

418
00:27:53,223 --> 00:27:54,884
We use protection.

419
00:27:55,358 --> 00:27:57,622
You're still sleeping with totaI strangers.

420
00:27:57,694 --> 00:27:59,161
They could be psychopaths.

421
00:27:59,229 --> 00:28:01,060
I knew I shouldn't have said anything.

422
00:28:01,130 --> 00:28:03,030
I knew you'd get all uptight.

423
00:28:03,132 --> 00:28:04,929
I'm not uptight.

424
00:28:05,335 --> 00:28:08,202
I just don't get the attraction
of that lifestyle.

425
00:28:08,271 --> 00:28:09,932
Then come with me.

426
00:28:14,844 --> 00:28:16,402
You're joking.

427
00:28:17,213 --> 00:28:18,737
I'm a married woman.

428
00:28:18,815 --> 00:28:22,478
You don't have to do anything.
Just come by. Check it out.

429
00:28:22,552 --> 00:28:26,886
You'll find that that lifestyle
is much more attractive than you think.

430
00:28:28,725 --> 00:28:30,454
This is ridiculous.

431
00:28:32,195 --> 00:28:36,131
How can I be part of something like that
when I've just grounded my son...

432
00:28:36,199 --> 00:28:38,690
for doing something half as sordid?

433
00:28:39,369 --> 00:28:40,597
Look, Julia...

434
00:28:41,371 --> 00:28:43,032
I'm no parent.

435
00:28:43,106 --> 00:28:45,836
lf you want to understand
what's going on in Matt's life...

436
00:28:45,908 --> 00:28:47,876
you gotta get into the reaI world.

437
00:28:47,944 --> 00:28:50,936
Threesomes. Foursomes. Moresomes.
They're like Starbucks.

438
00:28:51,014 --> 00:28:52,743
They're everywhere.

439
00:28:53,449 --> 00:28:56,816
Just look at it as a field trip
for modern parenting.

440
00:29:14,737 --> 00:29:16,796
-Let's get a drink.
-Let's go.

441
00:29:17,674 --> 00:29:19,039
What's the matter now?

442
00:29:19,108 --> 00:29:21,167
What if somebody sees us here?

443
00:29:21,244 --> 00:29:24,873
That Neutrogena contract I'm up for
has a morality clause, you know?

444
00:29:24,947 --> 00:29:26,505
Are you kidding me? Look around.

445
00:29:26,582 --> 00:29:30,848
There hasn't been a party this hot
since Versace's '96 New Year's Eve bash.

446
00:29:31,154 --> 00:29:34,715
Being seen here is gonna do nothing
but help your career.

447
00:29:35,958 --> 00:29:37,357
First time?

448
00:29:38,194 --> 00:29:39,218
Thought so.

449
00:29:39,295 --> 00:29:41,763
Hi, I'm Mia, one of the hosts
of tonight's party.

450
00:29:41,831 --> 00:29:44,391
-Thank you.
-Let me show you around.

451
00:29:44,701 --> 00:29:46,692
As you can see, this isn't a rave.

452
00:29:46,769 --> 00:29:49,260
There's no aggressive behavior allowed.

453
00:29:49,339 --> 00:29:51,830
Think of The Scene as a sexuaI buffet...

454
00:29:51,908 --> 00:29:54,274
with the finest of gourmet foods.

455
00:29:54,344 --> 00:29:58,246
You can eat all you want,
or you can nibble. That's up to you.

456
00:29:58,715 --> 00:30:01,240
For your protection,
each of the rooms comes complete...

457
00:30:01,317 --> 00:30:02,750
with an array of condoms.

458
00:30:02,819 --> 00:30:03,979
Rooms?

459
00:30:04,987 --> 00:30:06,614
Pleasure chambers.

460
00:30:07,256 --> 00:30:11,022
Orgy. Voyeur. Role-play. GirI on girl.

461
00:30:12,395 --> 00:30:14,522
Any questions, come see me.

462
00:30:15,298 --> 00:30:16,560
Enjoy.

463
00:30:17,967 --> 00:30:19,161
Thanks.

464
00:30:27,110 --> 00:30:29,874
Do you think these girls
are prettier than me?

465
00:30:29,946 --> 00:30:33,882
You are the hottest piece of ass
in this place. And you're mine.

466
00:30:33,950 --> 00:30:35,815
But if I'm gonna do
this one-woman thing...

467
00:30:35,885 --> 00:30:38,012
it can't be with just one woman.

468
00:30:40,490 --> 00:30:42,515
Whatever happens here...

469
00:30:43,292 --> 00:30:45,692
I'm with you, and you're with me.

470
00:31:08,618 --> 00:31:10,643
What do you wanna do first?

471
00:31:47,824 --> 00:31:49,849
Can she come out and play?

472
00:33:53,683 --> 00:33:54,945
Hey, Dad.

473
00:34:00,556 --> 00:34:02,581
-You got a minute?
-What's up?

474
00:34:03,559 --> 00:34:05,789
Nothing alarming. Don't worry.

475
00:34:07,163 --> 00:34:09,028
I just wanna tell you...

476
00:34:09,098 --> 00:34:12,397
I appreciate what you did
at the intervention thing.

477
00:34:12,902 --> 00:34:14,494
You had my back.

478
00:34:14,870 --> 00:34:17,805
You're my son, Matt.
I always have your back.

479
00:34:18,441 --> 00:34:21,069
Even when you feeI like I'm riding it.

480
00:34:22,111 --> 00:34:23,738
ls Mom coming home for dinner?

481
00:34:23,813 --> 00:34:26,475
She's studying with Jude.

482
00:34:29,819 --> 00:34:31,218
You wanna grab a bite?

483
00:34:31,287 --> 00:34:34,586
I can't. I got a date with Ridley.

484
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:41,061
ls that the kind of man
you're gonna be, Matt?

485
00:34:43,065 --> 00:34:45,260
What's that supposed to mean?

486
00:34:47,069 --> 00:34:48,900
When your mother
got pregnant with you...

487
00:34:48,971 --> 00:34:52,532
I didn't care if you were a boy
or a girl, as long as you were healthy.

488
00:34:52,608 --> 00:34:56,203
After a few months, I didn't even care
if you were healthy or not.

489
00:34:56,278 --> 00:34:57,768
You were mine.

490
00:34:57,947 --> 00:35:00,472
I was gonna love you no matter what.

491
00:35:00,549 --> 00:35:03,609
I never really cared if you excelled
in schooI or athletics...

492
00:35:03,686 --> 00:35:06,484
or what you decided to do with your life.

493
00:35:06,822 --> 00:35:10,986
The only thing I ever wanted for you
was that you be a good person...

494
00:35:11,327 --> 00:35:14,023
not someone who would
hurt someone intentionally.

495
00:35:14,096 --> 00:35:16,064
I didn't mean to hurt her, Dad.

496
00:35:17,867 --> 00:35:19,164
I didn't.

497
00:35:19,869 --> 00:35:21,700
Vanessa's gay, Matt.

498
00:35:22,271 --> 00:35:23,795
It's not a choice.

499
00:35:26,342 --> 00:35:28,333
You dating her friend is.

500
00:36:38,447 --> 00:36:39,607
Julia !

501
00:36:42,485 --> 00:36:43,782
Dr. Troy.

502
00:36:44,487 --> 00:36:47,388
Oh, my God, this is so embarrassing.

503
00:36:48,324 --> 00:36:50,554
I told you we'd run into someone I know.

504
00:36:50,626 --> 00:36:53,493
Everything okay, Dr. Troy?
You look a little flush.

505
00:36:53,696 --> 00:36:55,061
I'm fine.

506
00:36:55,131 --> 00:36:57,725
I just thought you were someone else.

507
00:36:58,033 --> 00:36:59,432
Really? Who?

508
00:37:00,603 --> 00:37:01,968
Julia McNamara...

509
00:37:03,739 --> 00:37:05,502
his partner's wife.

510
00:37:05,641 --> 00:37:08,075
You look a bit like her, actually.

511
00:37:11,347 --> 00:37:14,111
No need to be embarrassed,
Mrs. Schiraldi.

512
00:37:14,183 --> 00:37:15,980
My lips are sealed.

513
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:19,715
ln that case...

514
00:37:19,789 --> 00:37:22,087
we're gonna hit the voyeur room.

515
00:37:23,225 --> 00:37:24,590
Wanna come?

516
00:37:25,027 --> 00:37:26,961
-Maybe later.
-Okay.

517
00:37:33,669 --> 00:37:35,193
Where'd you go?

518
00:37:36,238 --> 00:37:37,899
I needed some air.

519
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:41,309
Did you see?
I did everything you asked me to.

520
00:37:44,346 --> 00:37:46,177
You were sexy, baby.

521
00:37:48,284 --> 00:37:49,842
Wanna get out of here?

522
00:37:55,457 --> 00:37:57,584
I think we're gonna be okay.

523
00:38:01,964 --> 00:38:04,091
She's at his place
studying almost every day.

524
00:38:04,166 --> 00:38:07,294
Now she's stashing pornographic
pictures of him in her schoolbook?

525
00:38:07,369 --> 00:38:09,803
-Something's going on.
-Burn it and stop worrying.

526
00:38:09,872 --> 00:38:11,396
She's not sleeping with him.

527
00:38:11,473 --> 00:38:13,338
How can you be so sure?

528
00:38:13,409 --> 00:38:16,674
Because you and Julia
are both too honest to cheat.

529
00:38:21,684 --> 00:38:25,051
He's probably worn out his welcome here
though, don't you think?

530
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:26,644
I can't fire him.

531
00:38:26,722 --> 00:38:28,986
She'd think I was doing it
because I was jealous.

532
00:38:29,058 --> 00:38:30,787
And she'd be right.

533
00:38:32,027 --> 00:38:34,325
l'll take the bullet for you on this one.

534
00:38:34,396 --> 00:38:36,023
The kid's bad news.

535
00:38:36,265 --> 00:38:38,597
He reminds me of me at that age.

536
00:38:49,478 --> 00:38:52,606
The extra blood work
you ordered on Cliff Mantegna.

537
00:38:52,681 --> 00:38:55,172
You might wanna check out Page 2.

538
00:38:59,021 --> 00:39:00,420
Hepatitis C?

539
00:39:01,657 --> 00:39:04,125
-ls that like AlDS?
-It's a virus.

540
00:39:04,426 --> 00:39:07,918
You were probably infected
by one of your sexuaI partners.

541
00:39:07,997 --> 00:39:09,396
Am I gonna die?

542
00:39:09,465 --> 00:39:11,262
The fatality rate is very low...

543
00:39:11,333 --> 00:39:13,995
but the chances of chronic infection
are high.

544
00:39:14,069 --> 00:39:17,266
You're gonna have to
get tested periodically for liver disease.

545
00:39:17,339 --> 00:39:20,740
Why didn't you tell me this
before my surgery?

546
00:39:20,809 --> 00:39:24,301
We usually don't run the full STD panel
on our patients.

547
00:39:24,380 --> 00:39:27,349
The law says we have to work on you
no matter what you have...

548
00:39:27,416 --> 00:39:29,884
but given your lifestyle,
I thought, as a courtesy...

549
00:39:29,952 --> 00:39:31,886
l'd run it through free of charge.

550
00:39:31,954 --> 00:39:34,650
I thought you could use it
to get into more parties.

551
00:39:34,723 --> 00:39:36,350
I wasn't anticipating this.

552
00:39:36,425 --> 00:39:38,985
You're gonna have to inform
your future sexuaI partners.

553
00:39:39,061 --> 00:39:40,551
That I'm sick?

554
00:39:41,530 --> 00:39:44,658
What swingers group
is gonna want me after that?

555
00:39:46,302 --> 00:39:49,703
Two months in this bra. All that money.

556
00:39:50,539 --> 00:39:52,507
This pain. And for what?

557
00:39:53,409 --> 00:39:57,641
So that I can try to find some girl
who doesn't care that I'm sick...

558
00:39:58,013 --> 00:39:59,640
and be monogamous?

559
00:39:59,915 --> 00:40:02,042
I can't do that. I can't.

560
00:40:02,151 --> 00:40:05,052
I can't just go back to normaI life.

561
00:40:06,622 --> 00:40:08,419
What am I gonna do?

562
00:40:22,137 --> 00:40:23,934
You wanted to see me?

563
00:40:24,206 --> 00:40:25,730
Yeah. Come in.

564
00:40:30,913 --> 00:40:32,403
Some party, huh?

565
00:40:32,481 --> 00:40:35,780
That Mrs. Schiraldi.
She's quite the hellcat.

566
00:40:37,786 --> 00:40:39,651
This is a business...

567
00:40:40,255 --> 00:40:41,984
not a pickup joint.

568
00:40:42,925 --> 00:40:44,449
You're right.

569
00:40:45,794 --> 00:40:47,125
lt won't happen again.

570
00:40:47,196 --> 00:40:50,996
That's right, it won't.
Because I want you out of here today.

571
00:40:51,834 --> 00:40:53,825
You're kidding me, right?

572
00:40:53,936 --> 00:40:55,767
And take some advice.

573
00:40:56,805 --> 00:40:58,500
Back off Julia as well.

574
00:41:00,042 --> 00:41:01,475
Who are you, her husband?

575
00:41:01,543 --> 00:41:04,273
Her husband's best friend. And partner.

576
00:41:06,248 --> 00:41:08,341
Very weird how upset you were...

577
00:41:08,417 --> 00:41:11,682
when you thought Mrs. Schiraldi
was Julia at the party.

578
00:41:12,287 --> 00:41:15,017
lt was as if I was there with your wife.

579
00:41:15,257 --> 00:41:17,919
That and the way she talks about you
could give someone...

580
00:41:17,993 --> 00:41:19,790
the wrong impression.

581
00:41:19,962 --> 00:41:21,452
Just a guess...

582
00:41:21,530 --> 00:41:24,090
but I bet you won't be flashing
those pearly whites...

583
00:41:24,166 --> 00:41:27,624
after I make a few calls and tell my pals
at the University of Miami...

584
00:41:27,703 --> 00:41:29,330
that I fired you.

585
00:41:30,372 --> 00:41:33,136
You make that call, Dr. Troy,
to the university.

586
00:41:33,208 --> 00:41:35,642
That will give me free time
to have a nice lunch...

587
00:41:35,711 --> 00:41:39,772
with your partner, and tell him
that you're in love with his wife.

588
00:41:43,886 --> 00:41:45,046
Do it.

589
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:47,918
Just make sure your insurance is paid up.

590
00:41:58,734 --> 00:42:00,395
Try moving it now.

591
00:42:12,881 --> 00:42:14,109
Amazing.

592
00:42:15,584 --> 00:42:18,951
Yeah, we're not all quacks,
no matter what the AMA says.

593
00:42:23,092 --> 00:42:26,994
My partner didn't have to remind me
that you're a chiropractor.

594
00:42:27,763 --> 00:42:29,856
I've never forgotten anything about you.

595
00:42:29,932 --> 00:42:31,331
Sean, don't.

596
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:36,066
You said I should be honest
with my feelings, no matter what they are.

597
00:42:36,905 --> 00:42:39,396
Sometimes people can be too honest.

598
00:42:40,509 --> 00:42:42,841
I can't stop thinking about you.

599
00:42:44,980 --> 00:42:49,110
Just tell me you don't feeI the same way,
and you'll never see me again.

600
00:42:51,687 --> 00:42:53,882
lt doesn't matter how I feel.

601
00:42:55,524 --> 00:42:57,219
You're married...

602
00:42:57,759 --> 00:43:00,091
and I'm barely divorced....

603
00:43:00,262 --> 00:43:02,253
I think you're beautiful.

604
00:43:02,531 --> 00:43:04,089
That's my point.

605
00:43:07,102 --> 00:43:09,070
The way you look at me....

606
00:43:09,505 --> 00:43:11,996
I don't think I can let myself
be that vulnerable...

607
00:43:12,074 --> 00:43:13,974
with a man that I can't have.

608
00:43:17,613 --> 00:43:19,706
Who says you can't have me?

609
00:43:53,448 --> 00:43:54,847
You asshole.

610
00:43:59,021 --> 00:44:00,648
Nice to see you too, Jules.

611
00:44:00,722 --> 00:44:04,089
How could you fire my friend
without talking to me about it first?

612
00:44:04,159 --> 00:44:06,855
This internship was very important to him.

613
00:44:06,929 --> 00:44:10,956
lf it was, he shouldn't have taken
one of our clients to a swingers party.

614
00:44:11,033 --> 00:44:13,365
You should reconsider
who you are friends with.

615
00:44:13,435 --> 00:44:14,732
He could've hurt our business.

616
00:44:14,803 --> 00:44:17,772
Bullshit, Christian.
This isn't about the business.

617
00:44:17,839 --> 00:44:19,704
This is about you and me.

618
00:44:19,775 --> 00:44:22,767
-You can't stand the competition.
-Don't flatter yourself.

619
00:44:22,844 --> 00:44:25,745
This is about you playing Demi Moore
with a 25-year-old kid...

620
00:44:25,814 --> 00:44:27,247
with an overactive libido.

621
00:44:27,316 --> 00:44:30,376
The one with the overactive libido
is a middle-aged surgeon.

622
00:44:30,452 --> 00:44:33,046
I'm looking after
my best friend's interests.

623
00:44:33,121 --> 00:44:34,713
You're my partner's wife.

624
00:44:34,790 --> 00:44:36,917
His well-being is intimately tied to mine.

625
00:44:36,992 --> 00:44:39,017
You fired him for revenge.

626
00:44:39,094 --> 00:44:41,619
Someone else is interested in me...

627
00:44:41,830 --> 00:44:44,264
and you can't stand it.

628
00:44:44,333 --> 00:44:45,527
Please.

629
00:44:45,968 --> 00:44:48,960
I can have anything I want,
any time I want it.

630
00:44:49,204 --> 00:44:50,865
You can't have me.

631
00:44:51,273 --> 00:44:54,071
Can't l? Face the cold, hard facts, Julia.

632
00:44:54,176 --> 00:44:57,976
You're still pining away for me
like you have been for years.

633
00:44:58,046 --> 00:44:59,775
Your boytoy is me.

634
00:45:01,049 --> 00:45:02,880
Fifteen years younger than you.

635
00:45:02,951 --> 00:45:05,215
Poor man's version of me.
Have you kissed him yet?

636
00:45:05,287 --> 00:45:07,619
You couldn't handle it if I did.

637
00:45:10,359 --> 00:45:13,522
When you did, were you thinking of me?

638
00:45:49,765 --> 00:45:52,495
You know what I was just thinking about?

639
00:45:56,171 --> 00:45:57,263
What?

640
00:45:57,906 --> 00:45:58,998
Jude.

641
00:46:34,843 --> 00:46:35,832
Rip by youyoup
