1
00:00:07,968 --> 00:00:11,418
Tell me what you don't like about yourself,
Mrs. Kringle.

2
00:00:11,418 --> 00:00:16,292
These last 15 pounds.
I've just had no luck getting rid of them.

3
00:00:16,292 --> 00:00:19,821
The first 75 didn't exactly fall off, either.

4
00:00:20,534 --> 00:00:24,145
It's a proven fact that men and women lose fat at different rates.

5
00:00:24,145 --> 00:00:26,255
Why do you always have to compare?

6
00:00:26,255 --> 00:00:29,106
You were the one sneaking all the extra zone bars, mama.

7
00:00:29,106 --> 00:00:30,869
That's all I'm saying.

8
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:35,120
Wesley and I used to both be a lot heavier,

9
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:38,358
but we went on a liquid diet last spring, and together

10
00:00:38,358 --> 00:00:41,190
lost almost 200 pounds.

11
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:43,040
That's impressive.
Congratulations.

12
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:44,923
But now the holidays are here and

13
00:00:44,923 --> 00:00:48,767
I've just gotta lose these last few inches before Christmas.

14
00:00:48,768 --> 00:00:50,043
Can lipo help?

15
00:00:50,043 --> 00:00:52,601
Usually we get requests like yours after new year's,

16
00:00:52,601 --> 00:00:54,479
when everyone makes their resolutions.

17
00:00:54,479 --> 00:00:58,828
Oh, we made a resolution a year ago to be at 10% body fat by now.

18
00:00:58,828 --> 00:01:00,735
It was a career choice.

19
00:01:00,735 --> 00:01:05,858
Joy and I, we're the feature attraction over at the dolphin mall during the holidays.

20
00:01:05,858 --> 00:01:09,429
We work as Santa and Mrs. Claus.

21
00:01:10,129 --> 00:01:12,388
With a name like kringle, what are the odds?

22
00:01:12,388 --> 00:01:14,922
Oh, it's not a coincidence, doctor.

23
00:01:17,334 --> 00:01:18,400
Thank you.

24
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:19,965
We used to be the Mayfields,

25
00:01:19,965 --> 00:01:23,518
but we had our name legally changed back in '91.

26
00:01:23,518 --> 00:01:25,786
I think that's when we started putting on the weight, right?

27
00:01:25,968 --> 00:01:28,421
Well, we were very method back then.

28
00:01:29,035 --> 00:01:32,612
Of course, with childhood obesity rates the way they are today, fat

29
00:01:32,612 --> 00:01:34,800
is not an image we want to promote anymore.

30
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:38,986
The holidays don't have to be about gluttony and overindulgence.

31
00:01:39,395 --> 00:01:43,150
The true spirit of Christmas is about celebration and good cheer,

32
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:47,049
and studies show that people are much cheerier if they're healthy.

33
00:01:47,049 --> 00:01:48,635
Now, we try to teach the kids that.

34
00:01:48,635 --> 00:01:51,868
Even our candy canes are sugar-free.

35
00:01:53,093 --> 00:01:55,305
We do this for the children.

36
00:01:56,065 --> 00:02:00,575
We never had any of our own and it ruined the holidays for us,

37
00:02:00,575 --> 00:02:04,076
so one year as a joke, we dressed up as the clauses

38
00:02:04,076 --> 00:02:08,752
and we got so much enjoyment out of seeing the kids' faces,

39
00:02:08,752 --> 00:02:11,534
we never stopped.

40
00:02:11,534 --> 00:02:14,396
We take it very seriously now.

41
00:02:15,727 --> 00:02:19,039
Does that mean we'll be sending your bill to the North Pole?

42
00:02:24,605 --> 00:02:29,629
Well, we can certainly explore the option of micro-lipo,

43
00:02:29,629 --> 00:02:31,997
although I have to say, having 2 kids of my own,

44
00:02:31,997 --> 00:02:37,785
the idea of a trim Santa seems nontraditional.

45
00:02:38,001 --> 00:02:39,912
You still pad the suit, though, right?

46
00:02:39,912 --> 00:02:42,336
I was planning on bringing my daughter by next week.

47
00:02:45,267 --> 00:02:47,084
It's our sincere hope

48
00:02:47,084 --> 00:02:50,230
that by the time your kids have kids, doctor,

49
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:53,306
Santa will no longer be thought of as the fat man.

50
00:02:53,825 --> 00:02:58,493
He'll be trim, tight, and a little bit sexy.

51
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:02,996
What about the elves?

52
00:03:02,996 --> 00:03:05,289
I always felt like that was indentured servitude.

53
00:03:05,289 --> 00:03:07,206
Are you gonna do something about that?

54
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:08,169
Do you think Mary had sex with God?

55
00:04:12,392 --> 00:04:16,586
Well, um, my personal theory

56
00:04:16,586 --> 00:04:21,410
is that Mary got it on with Joseph before the wedding,

57
00:04:21,410 --> 00:04:26,902
and then when Jesus was born less than 9 months later,

58
00:04:26,902 --> 00:04:30,062
she told everyone it was a virgin birth.

59
00:04:30,062 --> 00:04:33,748
That way, no one would know she had sex before she was married.

60
00:04:33,967 --> 00:04:36,525
It would be pretty tough to get away with that today.

61
00:04:36,525 --> 00:04:38,159
Matt, knock it off.

62
00:04:40,231 --> 00:04:43,029
Although, come to think of it,

63
00:04:43,029 --> 00:04:46,719
you and I know someone a lot like the virgin Mary,

64
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:50,730
only she got pregnant by her husband's best friend before the wedding.

65
00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:54,273
She also told a big old whopper of a lie,

66
00:04:54,273 --> 00:04:58,249
and everyone believed it for a very long time.

67
00:04:58,467 --> 00:05:02,006
Yes, but her baby was no son of God.

68
00:05:03,634 --> 00:05:06,208
It was a joke, mom.

69
00:05:06,209 --> 00:05:07,781
I'm sorry.

70
00:05:09,634 --> 00:05:11,978
Jesus, you're white as a sheet.

71
00:05:12,409 --> 00:05:13,668
Uh, I'm not feeling very...

72
00:05:13,668 --> 00:05:17,306
Oh, ok. Hey, whoa. I got you.
I got you, I got you.

73
00:05:17,306 --> 00:05:19,429
Here, come here.

74
00:05:21,134 --> 00:05:24,424
For years, I've been recommending you get a flu shot, Julia.

75
00:05:24,534 --> 00:05:28,334
Yeah, well, I wouldn't have bothered you,
but Dr. Edelman's out of town, and...

76
00:05:28,334 --> 00:05:31,367
I've been feeling really run down.

77
00:05:31,367 --> 00:05:33,379
Well, you've had a rough month.

78
00:05:34,607 --> 00:05:40,952
And it wouldn't be Christmas if you weren't trying to do more than humanly possible.

79
00:05:42,483 --> 00:05:44,492
At least when I was around,

80
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,124
you had a little help with all of it.

81
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,948
This will sting a little.

82
00:05:51,649 --> 00:05:55,380
I think you're mythologizing our holidays together, Sean.

83
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:59,157
What I remember most is nagging you endlessly.

84
00:05:59,338 --> 00:06:01,111
I remember that, too.

85
00:06:05,802 --> 00:06:07,475
Just hold this.

86
00:06:12,025 --> 00:06:14,063
I miss all of it.

87
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:22,657
Uh, so, you guys doing the big turkey dinner thing?

88
00:06:22,657 --> 00:06:24,986
No. Not this year.

89
00:06:24,986 --> 00:06:27,089
Matt's been invited to the Aldermans

90
00:06:27,089 --> 00:06:30,244
and Annie's going to Epcot with the Epsteins.

91
00:06:31,847 --> 00:06:37,602
So I imagine you and Quentin will be skiing in Gstaad or snorkeling in St. Bart's, then.

92
00:06:39,832 --> 00:06:42,704
I'm not seeing Quentin anymore.

93
00:06:43,934 --> 00:06:47,312
And he's no longer working at the spa.

94
00:06:47,649 --> 00:06:50,223
- He quit?
- I fired him.

95
00:06:50,733 --> 00:06:54,534
Please, Sean, no paternalistic I told you so's.

96
00:06:54,534 --> 00:06:57,560
I was just gonna say that

97
00:06:57,561 --> 00:07:00,196
I'm sorry if that puts a damper on your Christmas.

98
00:07:00,467 --> 00:07:04,093
No. I have a ton of work to do, and

99
00:07:04,093 --> 00:07:07,328
this year, Christmas is just another day.

100
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,157
Yeah.

101
00:07:12,568 --> 00:07:17,203
Well, aren't you gonna put the band-aid on me?

102
00:07:17,203 --> 00:07:18,456
R ight.

103
00:07:19,534 --> 00:07:20,878
Sorry.

104
00:07:45,156 --> 00:07:46,507
What?

105
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:51,385
I was just thinking that...

106
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,449
that we should have Linda do a blood panel,

107
00:08:01,449 --> 00:08:03,473
make sure you're not anemic.

108
00:08:06,722 --> 00:08:08,114
Y eah.

109
00:08:08,115 --> 00:08:09,308
Fine.

110
00:08:09,985 --> 00:08:11,687
You're the doctor.

111
00:08:32,635 --> 00:08:34,170
This is so wrong.

112
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:38,501
Yeah, I know. I didn't think they could put religious stuff on school grounds.

113
00:08:38,733 --> 00:08:40,820
Matt, are you looking at their faces?

114
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:42,026
They're black!

115
00:08:42,501 --> 00:08:44,299
Jesus was not black.

116
00:08:44,299 --> 00:08:47,715
They're a little dark-skinned, maybe, but it's not like they have afros.

117
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:52,346
Huh. It figures they would be allowed to do this.

118
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:54,824
Well, if you're that upset, talk to the principal.

119
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:58,644
Right. Principal Goldberg?

120
00:08:58,644 --> 00:09:01,789
Matt, she's a jew. She doesn't care about Christmas.

121
00:09:01,789 --> 00:09:04,357
She's at home on the 25th eating chinese food or something.

122
00:09:04,357 --> 00:09:07,152
I mean, if she really cared about this, this wouldn't have happened.

123
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:11,310
This whole thing is a fairy tale.

124
00:09:11,656 --> 00:09:13,932
Come on. I thought we were skipping last period.

125
00:09:13,932 --> 00:09:16,345
The story of the birth of Jesus is sacred, Matt.

126
00:09:16,539 --> 00:09:18,873
It's the foundation of all christianity.

127
00:09:18,873 --> 00:09:22,685
Saying that Jesus was a mud baby is like pissing on the bible.

128
00:09:22,969 --> 00:09:25,248
You're not supposed to take it literally.

129
00:09:25,248 --> 00:09:28,704
The story's for kids. Jesus is Santa Claus for adults.

130
00:09:29,125 --> 00:09:32,545
Do you know who Santa was before he became the marketing tool he's today ?

131
00:09:32,545 --> 00:09:34,619
St. Nicholas, the patron saint of charity.

132
00:09:34,619 --> 00:09:36,937
But by 1930, when Coca-Cola got ahold of him,

133
00:09:36,937 --> 00:09:39,648
he suddenly became this big fat-ass in a red suit,

134
00:09:39,648 --> 00:09:41,753
flying around with a sleigh and reindeer,

135
00:09:41,754 --> 00:09:45,123
totally corrupting the holiday and mocking any religious meaning behind it.

136
00:09:45,546 --> 00:09:47,382
- You're kidding.
- No, I'm not.

137
00:09:47,534 --> 00:09:50,644
It's a perfect example of what happens when we don't protect our history.

138
00:09:50,969 --> 00:09:53,290
When we don't protect our truth,

139
00:09:54,165 --> 00:09:55,918
it can be rewritten.

140
00:09:56,449 --> 00:09:58,162
We have to do something.

141
00:10:01,432 --> 00:10:02,628
The messiah?

142
00:10:02,629 --> 00:10:05,095
Liz, I thought you were an atheist.

143
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:06,947
I kind of go on the wagon around the holidays.

144
00:10:07,330 --> 00:10:09,750
You miss out on too much good music if you don't.

145
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:12,533
And it puts me in a very forgiving mood.

146
00:10:13,053 --> 00:10:15,567
Well, in that case, I'm glad it's on.

147
00:10:16,016 --> 00:10:19,773
All right. Shall we suck the pringles out of the kringle?

148
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,234
Oh, sorry, maestro.

149
00:10:29,234 --> 00:10:31,404
We started the performance without you.

150
00:10:35,767 --> 00:10:36,532
Are you ok?

151
00:10:36,532 --> 00:10:39,978
You look like somebody dumped a lump of coal in your stocking.

152
00:10:42,234 --> 00:10:44,172
Julia's pregnant.

153
00:10:45,465 --> 00:10:46,296
What?

154
00:10:46,296 --> 00:10:47,924
She came in earlier for a flu shot,

155
00:10:47,924 --> 00:10:50,183
I ran a blood panel as a precautionary measure,

156
00:10:50,183 --> 00:10:52,357
and the lab just called and said she was pregnant.

157
00:10:56,568 --> 00:10:57,894
Did you tell her?

158
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,232
Liz, you can't say anything.

159
00:11:03,233 --> 00:11:07,278
I think Julia's gonna be able to figure this out for herself.

160
00:11:08,946 --> 00:11:12,201
How long ago did she and Quentin start seeing each other?

161
00:11:12,201 --> 00:11:14,262
- Shit.
- Yeah.

162
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:16,560
No, shit, I hit something. Look.

163
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,574
What does it feel like?

164
00:11:19,575 --> 00:11:23,660
I don't know. Like a tumor or a hernia, maybe?

165
00:11:23,934 --> 00:11:25,813
That's no hernia.

166
00:11:26,172 --> 00:11:27,320
What are her vitals?

167
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:29,379
Heart rate's increasing.

168
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,599
We're gonna have to open her up.

169
00:11:32,968 --> 00:11:34,563
I'll go talk to Santa.

170
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:38,538
All right, we're gonna need a laparotomy tray.

171
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:51,060
Consent signed.
We're going in.

172
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:57,019
10 blade.

173
00:12:16,467 --> 00:12:18,551
What the hell is that?

174
00:12:21,401 --> 00:12:24,170
That's not growing out of her uterus, is it?

175
00:12:28,267 --> 00:12:29,864
Oh, my god.

176
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:33,451
It looks like somebody else didn't realize they were pregnant, either.

177
00:13:29,933 --> 00:13:31,393
Heads up.

178
00:13:33,467 --> 00:13:35,635
- Nice catch.
- I gots the good hands, baby.

179
00:13:35,674 --> 00:13:37,514
Oh, don't I know it.

180
00:13:41,634 --> 00:13:43,825
We have to do it, I guess.

181
00:14:10,086 --> 00:14:12,974
I know I'm supposed to call, but I...

182
00:14:13,363 --> 00:14:14,810
took a chance.

183
00:14:15,734 --> 00:14:17,549
I thought you'd want these.

184
00:14:17,905 --> 00:14:20,780
It's the handmad ornaments for when the kids were little.

185
00:14:22,167 --> 00:14:23,705
Great.

186
00:14:24,275 --> 00:14:27,986
One more box of decorations to hang.

187
00:14:29,706 --> 00:14:32,341
Annie said you guys already trimmed the tree.

188
00:14:32,341 --> 00:14:34,590
Yeah, well, you know how it is, Sean.

189
00:14:34,590 --> 00:14:37,139
Everyone starts out with good intentions.

190
00:14:37,139 --> 00:14:42,934
Than eventually I'm all by myself, eating all the cookies and guessing out loud to Jeopardy.

191
00:14:43,495 --> 00:14:46,025
By the way, have you seen Matt's baby ornament?

192
00:14:46,025 --> 00:14:48,719
I mean, maybe it's in here, but

193
00:14:48,719 --> 00:14:51,183
I don't know what could have happened to it.

194
00:14:51,334 --> 00:14:54,685
Do you think it's bad luck to lose your baby's first ornament?

195
00:14:54,685 --> 00:14:57,029
Is that like losing your wedding ring?

196
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:06,668
Julia, the blood panel came back.

197
00:15:10,394 --> 00:15:11,942
You're pregnant.

198
00:15:13,867 --> 00:15:16,706
Pregnant with a...
what did you call it?

199
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:18,699
A lithopedion.

200
00:15:18,699 --> 00:15:21,833
Litho meaning stone, pedion meaning child.

201
00:15:21,833 --> 00:15:26,259
You had a... petrified fetus inside of you.

202
00:15:26,567 --> 00:15:28,973
How does something like that happen?

203
00:15:30,301 --> 00:15:35,324
At some point, you had an undiagnose pregnancy and the fetus died.

204
00:15:35,324 --> 00:15:39,945
Through some fluke, it remained in your abdominal cavity and just calcified overtime.

205
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:44,626
Jesus, Mary, and Joseph.

206
00:15:44,626 --> 00:15:46,617
How long has it been in there?

207
00:15:48,668 --> 00:15:51,547
I'd say at least 15 years,

208
00:15:51,547 --> 00:15:54,334
maybe even 20 due to the level of calcification.

209
00:15:54,334 --> 00:15:56,902
The pathology lab will be much more precise.

210
00:15:59,501 --> 00:16:01,176
I'm sorry.

211
00:16:01,176 --> 00:16:03,689
This is kind of hard to believe.

212
00:16:03,690 --> 00:16:05,880
I don't believe it.

213
00:16:06,285 --> 00:16:08,633
The evidence is pretty irrefutable.

214
00:16:09,082 --> 00:16:13,173
I'm not pretending that I'm the virgin Mary,
but what I'm saying is that...

215
00:16:15,401 --> 00:16:19,122
I just didn't expect this.

216
00:16:23,601 --> 00:16:27,260
I have a colleague, a very good doctor who could take care...

217
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:29,514
I'm not ready for that conversation, Sean.

218
00:16:29,514 --> 00:16:31,322
I'm just trying to be helpful, Julia.

219
00:16:31,351 --> 00:16:33,269
I'm probably state it obviously here,

220
00:16:33,269 --> 00:16:34,550
but Quentin is not someone you want...

221
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:37,303
- Please Sean, don't say any more.
- Do you want this baby?

222
00:16:37,303 --> 00:16:39,537
I always wanted a baby.

223
00:16:40,933 --> 00:16:42,621
Both of us did.

224
00:16:44,701 --> 00:16:47,951
We were told it wasn't a possibility.

225
00:16:57,326 --> 00:16:59,554
Was it a boy or a girl?

226
00:17:01,867 --> 00:17:05,195
After they run all the tests, we'll know more.

227
00:17:05,196 --> 00:17:08,539
The organs weren't visible.

228
00:17:11,134 --> 00:17:14,805
Can I see it before it's sended off?

229
00:17:16,234 --> 00:17:19,000
I don't think that's a good idea.

230
00:17:23,642 --> 00:17:25,680
I need to see it.

231
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,623
I need to be alone now, Sean.

232
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:45,379
You haven't said anything to Quentin, have you?

233
00:17:47,142 --> 00:17:49,445
That's your job, Julia.

234
00:17:50,212 --> 00:17:52,121
I'd never do that.

235
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,438
Are you gonna tell him?

236
00:18:00,493 --> 00:18:04,751
Sorry. Like I said earlier, I should have call first.

237
00:19:20,334 --> 00:19:23,298
I don't know how I'm gonna tell Santa.

238
00:19:56,501 --> 00:19:59,906
Is that for me?
You shouldn't have.

239
00:20:01,334 --> 00:20:02,911
I'm here for my payout, Christian.

240
00:20:02,911 --> 00:20:04,704
You haven't answered my calls.

241
00:20:04,741 --> 00:20:06,148
I'll get it off in the morning.

242
00:20:06,148 --> 00:20:07,163
I need it now.

243
00:20:07,645 --> 00:20:09,597
I'm leaving for the holidays in the morning.

244
00:20:09,701 --> 00:20:10,985
All by your lonesome?

245
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,898
Whatever happened to your burgeoning relationship?

246
00:20:14,479 --> 00:20:16,172
What relationship?

247
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:22,334
I was under the impression that you and Julia...

248
00:20:22,334 --> 00:20:25,715
Julia and I had a parting of the ways.

249
00:20:27,425 --> 00:20:29,659
What was the problem, she didn't have a dick?

250
00:20:30,167 --> 00:20:31,685
I'll tell you something, Christian.

251
00:20:32,074 --> 00:20:34,904
She tried to blow me in her jacuzi and I had this epiphany.

252
00:20:34,904 --> 00:20:39,426
If I'm finding this the sad chore, how could I possibly go further?

253
00:20:40,158 --> 00:20:42,711
I had to finish off in the jet.

254
00:20:45,867 --> 00:20:49,749
- So you and Julia never...
- No. Not once.

255
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:53,170
I want my money now.

256
00:20:56,933 --> 00:20:59,762
To be honest, I'm thrilled to be writing this check.

257
00:20:59,762 --> 00:21:02,686
It means I'll never have to lay eyes on you again.

258
00:21:05,734 --> 00:21:07,321
What a gift.

259
00:21:09,067 --> 00:21:10,876
Happy holidays.

260
00:21:35,634 --> 00:21:38,176
Can you tell that she's still black?

261
00:21:41,758 --> 00:21:43,760
She looks albino.

262
00:21:44,685 --> 00:21:46,903
You know, I was, uh...

263
00:21:46,903 --> 00:21:48,661
I was thinking we should water

264
00:21:48,662 --> 00:21:52,636
some of this paint down so that they don't like so cartoonish.

265
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:56,780
No. I think we're gonna have to do second coats on all these.

266
00:21:57,167 --> 00:21:58,634
They're not white enough.

267
00:21:58,933 --> 00:22:00,246
You're kidding, right?

268
00:22:00,246 --> 00:22:02,545
No. I mean, you can tell that she's black.

269
00:22:02,546 --> 00:22:06,782
Look, when the light hits her, you can definitely tell.

270
00:22:07,314 --> 00:22:09,302
I think people will get the point.

271
00:22:09,601 --> 00:22:12,005
I don't want people to know that they were black underneath there before.

272
00:22:12,005 --> 00:22:13,738
Why is that wrong?

273
00:22:16,401 --> 00:22:17,808
Are you ok?

274
00:22:25,034 --> 00:22:26,432
Do you love me?

275
00:22:28,601 --> 00:22:31,659
- Is that what this is about?
- Do you love me ?

276
00:22:35,601 --> 00:22:43,514
Honey, I just stole the baby Jesus because you asked me to.

277
00:22:48,467 --> 00:22:51,496
Yes, I love you.

278
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:56,380
So if I told you a secret, you'd promise not to tell anyone, right ?

279
00:22:58,093 --> 00:22:59,985
You can trust me.

280
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:09,711
You had Mrs. Tigh's history class, right?

281
00:23:09,711 --> 00:23:13,061
She need us do this family tree,

282
00:23:13,062 --> 00:23:16,443
and I thought it was gonna be a good Christmas present for my family,

283
00:23:16,443 --> 00:23:23,660
you know, and I'm... and I've found out that my mom's great-grandmother...

284
00:23:25,501 --> 00:23:27,105
was black,

285
00:23:27,545 --> 00:23:30,154
which means that my mom is part black,

286
00:23:30,154 --> 00:23:33,060
which means that I'm...

287
00:23:33,467 --> 00:23:35,986
you didn't know that my mom was an octoroon when you met her, did you?

288
00:23:35,986 --> 00:23:37,780
- You couldn't tell.
- A what?

289
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:40,098
An octoroon 1/8 black.

290
00:23:40,098 --> 00:23:42,947
And that means that I'm 1/16... black.

291
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,771
Honey, I don't think anybody will ever be able to tell that.

292
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:49,914
My dad might.

293
00:23:49,914 --> 00:23:54,024
Matt, if I get any darker, then my dad's gonna be able to tell.

294
00:23:55,534 --> 00:23:58,633
Ariel, you're whiter than me.

295
00:23:58,633 --> 00:24:01,011
Well, genetically, I have more melanin in my skin.

296
00:24:01,334 --> 00:24:03,082
And one day, I could start to turn.

297
00:24:03,082 --> 00:24:05,194
I read it online, Matt.

298
00:24:15,367 --> 00:24:17,504
Could you help me bleach my skin?

299
00:24:18,289 --> 00:24:19,186
What?

300
00:24:19,186 --> 00:24:22,052
Yeah. There's this cream that you can get that whiter skin,

301
00:24:22,052 --> 00:24:24,483
and your mom probably has it at the spa,

302
00:24:24,483 --> 00:24:26,000
and all you need to do is just get ahold of some...

303
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,271
Honey, that's crazy.

304
00:24:27,271 --> 00:24:29,295
Why? People do it all the time, it's cosmetic.

305
00:24:29,296 --> 00:24:30,997
Trying to make your skin whiter?

306
00:24:30,997 --> 00:24:32,685
How is that gonna help anything?

307
00:24:32,685 --> 00:24:35,480
Because if my dad finds out that I have black blood in me,

308
00:24:35,886 --> 00:24:37,723
he's gonna go ballistic.

309
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:40,027
I mean, you've seen how he is,

310
00:24:40,027 --> 00:24:42,395
and I'm really scared what he's gonna do to me and my mom.

311
00:24:42,395 --> 00:24:45,595
Yeah, but so what if you've got black blood in you from 100 years ago?

312
00:24:45,734 --> 00:24:47,453
That doesn't change who you are now.

313
00:24:47,453 --> 00:24:49,236
- Oh, no?
- No.

314
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:53,579
Well, what happened when your dad found out 17 years later

315
00:24:53,579 --> 00:24:56,002
that you weren't the son that he thought you were?

316
00:24:58,668 --> 00:25:00,791
How did that work out for you?

317
00:25:21,994 --> 00:25:24,227
You must have been a very good boy this year.

318
00:25:24,227 --> 00:25:26,655
Santa brought you an early stuff in stuffer.

319
00:25:26,655 --> 00:25:30,705
Guess who is not the father of Julia's baby ?

320
00:25:31,518 --> 00:25:33,571
- You.
- Ha ha. Very funny.

321
00:25:33,591 --> 00:25:34,784
Quentin.

322
00:25:36,664 --> 00:25:39,143
You didn't tell him, did you?
I promised Julia...

323
00:25:39,143 --> 00:25:41,237
I wouldn't do that.
He volunteered it.

324
00:25:41,294 --> 00:25:44,031
He said that he never slept with Julia.

325
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:49,760
You believe him?

326
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:52,580
Why would he lie? He's too much of a cock not to crow.

327
00:25:53,131 --> 00:25:56,124
So she must be seeing someone.
She mention anything to you?

328
00:25:58,694 --> 00:26:02,659
No, uh... she hasn't.

329
00:26:02,659 --> 00:26:04,140
Are you sure?
Not even in passing ?

330
00:26:04,141 --> 00:26:06,794
I mean, you know, a friend or somebody new at work, or...

331
00:26:13,494 --> 00:26:15,085
Shit. Really?

332
00:26:18,279 --> 00:26:20,222
Then who the hell's the father?

333
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:23,948
Who is the goddamn father?!

334
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:27,947
It's a pretty simple question, Joy.

335
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:30,247
Everything all right in here?

336
00:26:32,127 --> 00:26:35,518
- I knew he wouldn't take it well.
- Take it well ?

337
00:26:35,518 --> 00:26:39,549
She tells me how she walks around with another man's baby inside of her ?

338
00:26:39,549 --> 00:26:41,979
Well, what am I supposed to say... ho, ho, ho?

339
00:26:41,979 --> 00:26:45,609
Let me tell you something.
You with a goddamn "Ho, Joy".

340
00:26:45,609 --> 00:26:48,418
Look, it's difficult news to absorb, Mr. Kringle,

341
00:26:48,418 --> 00:26:51,178
but your wife has just been through major surgery,

342
00:26:51,178 --> 00:26:52,619
and we need to stay calm.

343
00:26:52,619 --> 00:26:56,309
Oh, I'll be a lot calmer once I get an answer.

344
00:27:00,914 --> 00:27:04,184
It was 17 years ago.

345
00:27:04,804 --> 00:27:08,824
- It was just once.
- Who was it?!

346
00:27:11,446 --> 00:27:13,665
It was Andy.

347
00:27:19,635 --> 00:27:21,742
My assistant Andy?

348
00:27:23,594 --> 00:27:26,884
He was... he was 18 years old.

349
00:27:26,884 --> 00:27:31,271
He was... he was paying his way through college by working for us.

350
00:27:31,271 --> 00:27:33,859
How could you do that, Joy ?

351
00:27:34,027 --> 00:27:37,865
He paid me some goddamn attention, Wes.

352
00:27:37,866 --> 00:27:42,789
After the doctors told us your sperm was unvailable you just jumped

353
00:27:42,939 --> 00:27:47,812
headlong into the whole Santa thing and all the little brats.

354
00:27:48,379 --> 00:27:53,082
Worshipped you, and it was all about them and your career,

355
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:55,229
I got a little lonely.

356
00:27:55,327 --> 00:27:58,531
I couldn't talk to you.
I still can't.

357
00:28:01,261 --> 00:28:05,676
I'll never get past this, Joy... ever.

358
00:28:07,027 --> 00:28:11,412
You know, Mr. Kringle, I had a similar experience.

359
00:28:11,628 --> 00:28:14,833
Something from the past came up in my marriage, and

360
00:28:14,833 --> 00:28:16,863
given all you two have built together,

361
00:28:16,994 --> 00:28:19,399
I'd hate to see rashness prevail here.

362
00:28:19,561 --> 00:28:23,313
It's all been a lie, Joy ?
Our entire marriage?

363
00:28:23,313 --> 00:28:25,472
No, of course not.

364
00:28:25,472 --> 00:28:29,150
But every day isn't Christmas.

365
00:28:29,150 --> 00:28:32,787
Sometimes I don't feel jolly.
I feel like shit.

366
00:28:33,194 --> 00:28:36,824
I'm tired of being Mrs. Santa Claus.

367
00:28:36,824 --> 00:28:39,989
I just want to be myself...

368
00:28:39,990 --> 00:28:46,090
Joy Beckendahl, your normal, moody, middle-aged wife.

369
00:28:47,917 --> 00:28:51,057
Well, I don't think that's possible anymore, Joy.

370
00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:57,457
Maybe there's something to be said for embracing the truth,

371
00:28:57,933 --> 00:29:01,397
for living in the reality of a relationship instead of the myth.

372
00:29:05,533 --> 00:29:08,127
Well, here's my reality.

373
00:29:08,127 --> 00:29:13,992
She can be normal little Joy Beckendahl, the ex-Mrs. Kringle.

374
00:29:15,628 --> 00:29:17,509
Santa's going solo.

375
00:29:33,088 --> 00:29:37,748
If you want, I can give you a gift certificate for Mrs. Alderman came for a massage.

376
00:29:37,748 --> 00:29:40,348
Oh, please, mom.
This is already too much stuff.

377
00:29:40,348 --> 00:29:45,411
As a mother, I can tell you, if you're being invited to spend Christmas Eve at their house,

378
00:29:45,411 --> 00:29:47,108
you'd better make a good impression.

379
00:29:47,108 --> 00:29:49,896
Trust me. Giving Mrs. Alderman this much free swag

380
00:29:49,896 --> 00:29:52,750
will leave me impression I'm ready to marry her daughter.

381
00:29:53,227 --> 00:29:55,820
What's Ariel's mom like?

382
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:59,529
She's nice.
You know, typical mom.

383
00:29:59,530 --> 00:30:01,210
Nothing like you.

384
00:30:04,994 --> 00:30:07,255
I didn't mean that in a bad way.

385
00:30:08,094 --> 00:30:09,398
Sure you didn't.

386
00:30:09,527 --> 00:30:12,712
No. I meant you're more than just a mother.

387
00:30:15,274 --> 00:30:19,099
You're a big shot businesswoman with a whole new career for yourself.

388
00:30:20,784 --> 00:30:23,598
That's a hell of a lot better than being a stay-at-home mom, right?

389
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:29,735
Oh, honey, you don't need this.

390
00:30:29,735 --> 00:30:32,538
This is medical-grade skin bleach.

391
00:30:32,893 --> 00:30:35,602
Oh, wow thanks for catching that.

392
00:30:36,794 --> 00:30:42,423
Believe me, if Mrs. Alderman ever put that on by mistake you would never be invited back.

393
00:30:46,661 --> 00:30:48,707
Spa De La Mer.

394
00:31:08,202 --> 00:31:10,850
Thanks. You're busy.
I'll call you later, ok?

395
00:31:27,183 --> 00:31:29,451
Did you just call me?

396
00:31:31,998 --> 00:31:33,460
Did I?

397
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:37,427
Um... yeah.

398
00:31:37,628 --> 00:31:39,652
Why did you hang up?

399
00:31:42,615 --> 00:31:44,042
I was chicken.

400
00:31:48,827 --> 00:31:52,807
I was calling to see what you were doing Christmas Eve.

401
00:32:00,094 --> 00:32:01,801
Are you busy?

402
00:32:02,561 --> 00:32:04,228
Sort of. Uh...

403
00:32:06,094 --> 00:32:09,172
I have an appointment.

404
00:32:11,094 --> 00:32:13,783
And I'll probably want to be alone later.

405
00:32:22,294 --> 00:32:24,442
Maybe you should have someone drive you.

406
00:32:35,194 --> 00:32:37,540
Come on, let me see it, let me see it, let me see it.

407
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:39,782
All right. Jeez.

408
00:32:42,494 --> 00:32:43,981
Merry Christmas.

409
00:32:44,394 --> 00:32:47,030
You're silly. You didn't have to wrap it.

410
00:32:51,527 --> 00:32:53,511
Uh, what is this?

411
00:32:55,874 --> 00:33:00,629
Dr. Sloan is a psychotherapist who specializes in teen image issues.

412
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:02,849
My grandmother recommandize her.

413
00:33:04,661 --> 00:33:05,777
For what?

414
00:33:07,361 --> 00:33:10,470
I think you need to talk to someone about what you're going through,

415
00:33:10,470 --> 00:33:12,538
all this paranoia about being black.

416
00:33:12,538 --> 00:33:13,402
I'm worried.
You know,

417
00:33:13,402 --> 00:33:16,435
you're like an anorexic.
Only you can't get white enough.

418
00:33:16,461 --> 00:33:18,689
You are getting way too serious.

419
00:33:18,689 --> 00:33:20,264
Come on, just... where is the cream ?

420
00:33:20,264 --> 00:33:23,720
Look, I am serious, Ariel,
I think you need help.

421
00:33:23,793 --> 00:33:26,190
And when did you becoming expert on mental health?

422
00:33:30,094 --> 00:33:31,628
Aha! Found it!

423
00:33:31,628 --> 00:33:33,836
That's only in there because I'm returning it.

424
00:33:33,836 --> 00:33:35,553
- You can't have it.
- What is your problem?

425
00:33:35,553 --> 00:33:38,582
Yesterday we were having so much fun and you were totally on board in this.

426
00:33:38,582 --> 00:33:40,709
Yeah, well, it's not fun anymore.

427
00:33:40,709 --> 00:33:43,467
You're talking about hurting yourself with something crazy.

428
00:33:43,561 --> 00:33:46,168
Hurting myself ?
They sell this in beauty parlors, Matt.

429
00:33:46,527 --> 00:33:47,933
What's a big deal?

430
00:33:47,934 --> 00:33:49,702
It's stronger than that stuff.

431
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:51,805
You know what? If I knew you were gonna be like this,

432
00:33:51,805 --> 00:33:53,953
I would have ordered in my mind.

433
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:59,408
You think it's working?
How do I look?

434
00:34:01,361 --> 00:34:03,529
A little insane, actually.

435
00:34:05,261 --> 00:34:07,063
You know what?
Screw you, Matt.

436
00:34:07,063 --> 00:34:10,059
I thought you actually understood what I was going though, but you don't.

437
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:12,196
I should have never trusted you! Get out!

438
00:34:13,027 --> 00:34:14,312
Fine.

439
00:34:22,094 --> 00:34:23,527
Asshole.

440
00:34:28,027 --> 00:34:29,913
Wait.
Don't leave.

441
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:32,767
No, I think you're right.
I should go.

442
00:34:32,860 --> 00:34:34,752
My face... it feels like it's on fire.

443
00:34:35,006 --> 00:34:38,154
My face. How do you make it stop? It hurts!

444
00:34:39,458 --> 00:34:40,731
How do you make it stop?!

445
00:34:40,731 --> 00:34:42,254
Re making it worse!

446
00:34:42,254 --> 00:34:44,787
Ok, ok! Come on!

447
00:34:59,702 --> 00:35:01,537
Is she gonna be ok?

448
00:35:01,537 --> 00:35:04,232
It's nothing worse than a first-degree burn.

449
00:35:05,548 --> 00:35:08,774
You're lucky Matt brought you in as soon as he did.

450
00:35:09,118 --> 00:35:11,470
There should be no permanent scarring.

451
00:35:13,150 --> 00:35:15,238
Thank you by the way.

452
00:35:15,823 --> 00:35:19,914
So I guess plastic surgeons aren't the devil when you need them, huh?

453
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,371
Matt, can I have a word?

454
00:35:31,145 --> 00:35:32,487
You're both very lucky.

455
00:35:32,487 --> 00:35:35,190
If she had a reaction, she'd be in shock right now.

456
00:35:35,223 --> 00:35:37,651
Yeah. I told her it was a bad idea.

457
00:35:37,651 --> 00:35:40,824
Now, was that before or after you stole the cream from your mother ?

458
00:35:42,642 --> 00:35:44,609
Look, you want to shave your head and ruin your life, that's fine,

459
00:35:44,609 --> 00:35:47,749
but when you hurt other people, that's when I have a problem.

460
00:35:47,749 --> 00:35:49,857
Look, I came to you for help,

461
00:35:50,191 --> 00:35:52,579
gonna turn into a father/son lecture, then...

462
00:35:52,579 --> 00:35:55,562
Let's stop pretending we have a father/son relationship, shall we?

463
00:35:57,371 --> 00:35:59,174
I'm billing you for my time.

464
00:36:00,123 --> 00:36:02,915
Matt! Hey...

465
00:36:03,485 --> 00:36:07,175
Ariel. What... what's going on here?

466
00:36:07,175 --> 00:36:08,491
Dad, what are you doing here?

467
00:36:08,491 --> 00:36:11,809
Well, Matt called me.
What happened to your face?

468
00:36:11,809 --> 00:36:14,165
She had a reaction to a skin-bleaching cream.

469
00:36:14,165 --> 00:36:15,812
Nothing severe.
She's gonna be fine.

470
00:36:15,891 --> 00:36:17,542
Why did you call him?

471
00:36:18,002 --> 00:36:21,001
Because you can't keep hiding this anymore, Ariel.

472
00:36:21,001 --> 00:36:22,847
Hiding what?
What...

473
00:36:22,847 --> 00:36:24,484
How did this happen?

474
00:36:24,848 --> 00:36:27,405
Matt said that I should lighten my freckles,

475
00:36:27,405 --> 00:36:29,852
so he stole some bleach cream from his mom's spa,

476
00:36:29,852 --> 00:36:32,327
and we put it on my face and I had a reaction.

477
00:36:32,328 --> 00:36:33,887
You did this?

478
00:36:35,779 --> 00:36:38,445
Tell him you told me about the research paper.

479
00:36:38,868 --> 00:36:40,937
Honey, I won't let him hurt you.

480
00:36:40,938 --> 00:36:43,085
I don't know what you're talking about.

481
00:36:43,745 --> 00:36:47,275
Ariel discovered that her mother, your wife,

482
00:36:47,275 --> 00:36:48,641
comes from African lineage

483
00:36:48,641 --> 00:36:51,352
but she was so afraid of what you might do

484
00:36:51,352 --> 00:36:53,489
that she tried to bleach her skin!

485
00:36:53,489 --> 00:36:57,479
- What?
- Just tell her that being 1/16 black

486
00:36:57,479 --> 00:36:59,105
doesn't matter to you.

487
00:36:59,105 --> 00:37:02,432
That your love for her is not based on what color she is.

488
00:37:04,526 --> 00:37:05,959
Is that true?

489
00:37:06,588 --> 00:37:08,250
Of course not.

490
00:37:08,250 --> 00:37:10,208
Dad, I'm not black.

491
00:37:10,208 --> 00:37:13,399
He's just saying this to you because he doesn't want to get in trouble.

492
00:37:13,399 --> 00:37:16,742
- You are a sick person...
- You don't think

493
00:37:17,122 --> 00:37:20,668
that I'd ever hurt you, do you, sweetheart ?

494
00:37:32,245 --> 00:37:36,424
Well, I welcome you into our home,
and this is how you repay me,

495
00:37:36,424 --> 00:37:39,127
by making up these hateful lies?

496
00:37:39,492 --> 00:37:42,802
Mr. Alderman, she'll do something worse next now.

497
00:37:42,802 --> 00:37:45,824
No, my daughter is one of the most confident, strong women

498
00:37:45,824 --> 00:37:48,575
that I have ever known, and you couldn't handle that, could you?

499
00:37:48,575 --> 00:37:51,282
So you tried to change her face so that you feel better about yourself.

500
00:37:51,282 --> 00:37:53,118
You know, there's not definitively what he does.

501
00:37:53,118 --> 00:37:55,812
My son saved your daughter from a severe burn.

502
00:37:55,813 --> 00:37:58,521
Now, you can believe your own bullshit if you want to, that's fine.

503
00:37:58,521 --> 00:37:59,903
But unless you want a problem with me,

504
00:37:59,903 --> 00:38:01,780
I suggest you leave now.

505
00:38:02,730 --> 00:38:09,080
As long as your son stays away from my daughter, we have no problem.

506
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:21,176
Why didn't you tell me?

507
00:38:23,204 --> 00:38:26,564
Because people only believe what they want to.

508
00:38:30,311 --> 00:38:34,256
So, looks like my advice fell on deaf ears.

509
00:38:34,987 --> 00:38:36,954
Oh, I heard you, doctor.

510
00:38:36,954 --> 00:38:40,089
It's just that I hadn't met Circe yet.

511
00:38:42,284 --> 00:38:44,058
Well, that's not quite true.

512
00:38:44,058 --> 00:38:47,159
Joy used to catch us flirting all the time.

513
00:38:48,109 --> 00:38:51,119
Circe work on the Cinnabun near the North Pole.

514
00:38:51,913 --> 00:38:55,026
Well, she's not going to catch you here if that's what you were hoping.

515
00:38:55,026 --> 00:38:56,663
Your wife checked out this morning.

516
00:38:56,663 --> 00:38:58,685
- She did?
- Yes.

517
00:38:59,305 --> 00:39:00,572
Well, so what?

518
00:39:01,571 --> 00:39:04,630
She'll... she'll hear about it, one way or another.

519
00:39:04,631 --> 00:39:06,420
I work with Santa now.

520
00:39:06,815 --> 00:39:08,817
And you work quickly...

521
00:39:09,422 --> 00:39:11,730
Look, doc, all year long it's, uh...

522
00:39:11,730 --> 00:39:14,689
"Gimme an x-box.
Gimme a spongebob."

523
00:39:14,689 --> 00:39:17,696
I spend my life fulfilling other people's wishes.

524
00:39:17,696 --> 00:39:20,215
I'm sure you know something about that.

525
00:39:20,755 --> 00:39:23,578
This year, Santa got himself a present.

526
00:39:24,113 --> 00:39:28,552
Circe here has a fantastic, wonderful Christmas spirit,

527
00:39:28,806 --> 00:39:32,048
and I like a rewarder with some double ds.

528
00:39:33,109 --> 00:39:34,172
Come on, doc.

529
00:39:34,172 --> 00:39:37,347
What better way to remote Santa's new image than by

530
00:39:37,347 --> 00:39:41,143
showing off his healthy young woman?

531
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:12,438
Matty. What are you doing here?

532
00:40:12,438 --> 00:40:16,309
I didn't... I didn't think you'd be home on Christmas Eve.

533
00:40:16,969 --> 00:40:19,272
Uh, I was just leaving that for you.

534
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:34,440
It's an I.O.U.
30 hours slave labor...

535
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:36,294
car washes, coffee runs,

536
00:40:36,294 --> 00:40:38,881
whatever you need to pay off Ariel's visit.

537
00:40:40,152 --> 00:40:42,510
I'm not exactly liquid right now.

538
00:40:44,636 --> 00:40:46,717
- Merry Christmas.
- You're hungry ?

539
00:40:47,317 --> 00:40:49,641
I just bought a ton of food.

540
00:41:11,276 --> 00:41:13,284
Not a bad way to spend the holidays.

541
00:41:17,192 --> 00:41:21,542
Two single men watching football, eating Chinese,

542
00:41:21,542 --> 00:41:22,994
it's America.

543
00:41:28,462 --> 00:41:30,029
How are you doing by the way ?

544
00:41:33,389 --> 00:41:34,910
I don't think about her.

545
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:43,022
I was proud of what you did earlier.

546
00:41:43,022 --> 00:41:45,535
Standing up to that asshole took guts.

547
00:41:46,041 --> 00:41:47,979
It's not gonna change anything, man.

548
00:41:48,385 --> 00:41:51,574
They'll go on living in lie and no one ever talk about it.

549
00:41:57,151 --> 00:41:59,089
You ever wish you didn't know about me ?

550
00:41:59,531 --> 00:42:01,459
Being your biological father ?

551
00:42:06,074 --> 00:42:12,128
Yeah. It were certainly easier not knowing.

552
00:42:13,862 --> 00:42:15,585
But, uh...

553
00:42:18,987 --> 00:42:20,731
I'm adjusting.

554
00:42:29,053 --> 00:42:30,121
You?

555
00:42:35,852 --> 00:42:37,433
I'm adjusting, too.

556
00:43:00,947 --> 00:43:04,895
I'm Julia McNamara.
I have a 7:30 appointment.

557
00:43:05,888 --> 00:43:08,573
Just fill this out, Mrs. McNamara.

558
00:43:15,983 --> 00:43:17,524
Rain started yet?

559
00:43:17,524 --> 00:43:18,957
Not yet.

560
00:43:20,979 --> 00:43:22,501
Any minute, though.

561
00:43:26,934 --> 00:43:31,517
Thank you. Please have a sit, the doctor will be out in a few minutes.

562
00:43:56,600 --> 00:44:03,116
I was thinking... there are the first Christmas Eve alone without the kids in 18 years.

563
00:44:06,006 --> 00:44:10,160
Yes. Just thinking the same thing.

564
00:44:22,891 --> 00:44:25,282
It' your baby, Sean.

565
00:44:30,132 --> 00:44:31,514
I know.

566
00:44:36,543 --> 00:44:40,100
Mrs. McNamara?
The doctor's ready for you now.

567
00:45:34,700 --> 00:45:36,679
I don't want to do this.

568
00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:38,478
Me neither.

569
00:45:40,724 --> 00:45:42,531
Let's get out of here.

570
00:47:05,500 --> 00:47:11,568
