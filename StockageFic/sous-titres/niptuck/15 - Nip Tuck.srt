1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:02,155
<i>Previously on Nip / Tuck:</i>

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:04,675
Ms. Gaines was brutalized
by a serial rapist.

3
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:05,795
The Carver.

4
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:07,313
<i>That's what they're calling him.</i>

5
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:09,869
<i>We ran into Julia last night
on a date with some guy.</i>

6
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:11,917
It bothered me more
than I thought it would.

7
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:13,957
<i>You are the child's
biological mother.</i>

8
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:16,270
I fear for his life if he remains with you.

9
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:18,749
I'm granting the Sutherlands' request
for custody.

10
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:20,592
Christian, do something.

11
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:31,229
Looks like a basal cell carcinoma.
Nothing to worry about.

12
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:35,475
I can take it off with a local
right here in the office, Mrs. Camden.

13
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:38,032
That's Ms. Camden.

14
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:40,834
My divorce was final
three weeks ago.

15
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,797
I'm sorry to hear that.

16
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,549
I'm also sorry to say that you'll have
to stop the nude sunbathing.

17
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:50,789
Nope.

18
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:53,997
Tan lines are for strippers
and German tourists.

19
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:57,995
Then you'll have to find someone
to cover that...

20
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:01,869
three-spinning-classes-a-week
rear end of yours in SPF 50.

21
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:08,356
And how do you suppose I'll ever find
someone to perform that thankless task?

22
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:32,999
So how's next Tuesday for you,
Ms. Camden?

23
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,511
I think I can fit you in.

24
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,153
Hey, asshole.

25
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:58,871
You're like herpes. Every time I feel
like I'm getting my life back...

26
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,315
I have a Gina outbreak.
What do you want from me?

27
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:03,198
I need to talk. You need to listen.

28
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,396
Jesus, what is this? Step 9?

29
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:09,874
No need to apologize about
how you acted, Gina. I don't give a shit.

30
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:14,912
- I'm positive.
- Positive about what?

31
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,553
I had a fungus in my mouth.

32
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:38,871
<i>The doctor at the clinic
said it was Candid-something.</i>

33
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:45,118
<i>- Candida albicans.
- Yeah.</i>

34
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,272
I guess that could be
an early symptom for HIV...

35
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,878
so they tested me.

36
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,950
- When did you find out?
- A week.

37
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,233
Two weeks, maybe.

38
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,914
I'm all right, though.
They gave me some antibiotics...

39
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:07,799
for the fungus and put me on the cocktail.

40
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,669
Do they know when you contracted it?

41
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,872
They're not sure.

42
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,512
Six months or a year.

43
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:23,630
That's why I'm here,
to tell you to get tested.

44
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,279
How could you be so irresponsible?

45
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,954
You didn't stop to sheath your sword,
Sir Screws-A-Lot!

46
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:31,356
- I should have double-bagged it with you.
- You didn't, asshole, did you?

47
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:35,115
Because you thought you were invincible
and you didn't give a shit about me...

48
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,716
or any of the sluts you dumped your load
into over the past two decades!

49
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:39,949
Get out.

50
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,188
Get out of my life.

51
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:46,558
No, wait. Please, I need your help
to get a hold of James and Wilber!

52
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:58,790
The doctor said I could have passed it
on to him in utero.

53
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:03,349
I don't care about me,
but I need to know if my baby's sick.

54
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:06,110
I could deal with the pills
and with the pain...

55
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:08,475
but I cannot stand
not knowing if he's all right.

56
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,870
I am not helping you find shit.

57
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,032
You're a poison, Gina.

58
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:17,518
Everything you touch gets infected
with your own special brand of misery.

59
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:21,869
The way I figure it, asshole,
we're a match made in hell.

60
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:26,998
You know the only difference
between you and me?

61
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:30,509
I take responsibility for my mistakes.

62
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,155
"Beauty is a curse
on the world. "

63
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:44,793
<i>That's what he said
when he did this to me.</i>

64
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,073
And he's right. The way I look
has been my curse my whole life.

65
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,911
You can't take responsibility
for what happened to you, Mr. Rourke.

66
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:56,038
You were brutalized
by a very deranged individual.

67
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,031
My looks were his bait.

68
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,191
I never wanted to be a model.

69
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:08,875
<i>I was discovered at the beach,
celebrating an A in Legal Ethics.</i>

70
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:12,350
A photographer came up to me,
took a few pictures, and a month later...

71
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:16,115
I'm skipping the bar exam
to be on the cover of the J. Crew catalog.

72
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,750
Sounds like a dream come true.

73
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,669
May I?

74
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:38,468
I understand that you must be
feeling hopeless right now...

75
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,510
but have you seen Naomi Gaines?

76
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:44,590
She was one of The Carver's first, right?

77
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:49,038
<i>Yes. We did her corrective surgery.
She just booked the cover of SELF.</i>

78
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:52,237
<i>There's no reason why your surgery
won't be as successful as hers.</i>

79
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:55,198
We'll use musculature
from your inner thighs to repair...

80
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:58,796
- the nerve damage and cover the scarring.
- Not all of it.

81
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:04,079
Leave some of the cut on the right side.

82
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:07,394
The muscle loss from your legs
won't be noticeable...

83
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:10,432
- if that's what you're worried about.
- Look...

84
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:14,194
I have a responsibility to myself
to be more than...

85
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:18,672
some two-dimensional image in some
men's fitness magazine, okay?

86
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:26,519
Did you sustain any other injuries
besides the cuts to your face?

87
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:36,276
This is all covered under
the doctor-patient confidentiality, right?

88
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,469
Yes.

89
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:48,590
I've got a maxi pad shoved down
the back of my pants.

90
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,519
He raped me.

91
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,833
I've been shitting razor blades for a week.

92
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:06,359
I can bench 275 pounds.
I'm a goddamn black belt in Kenpo...

93
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:09,273
but I couldn't keep the son of a bitch...

94
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,118
He overpowered you?

95
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:15,392
He drugged me.
He shot me up with something.

96
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:18,555
I couldn't move, I couldn't talk.

97
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:23,597
We can repair the damage to your rectum
at the same time we work on your face.

98
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:28,349
Until then,
I'll prescribe some stool softeners.

99
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,516
I'm sorry I have to ask...

100
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:34,990
but have you had yourself tested for HIV?

101
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:36,309
No need to.

102
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:39,074
Asshole had enough
self-control to use a condom.

103
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:41,800
<i>Police said it was to avoid
leaving any DNA evidence...</i>

104
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:44,952
<i>but I think the guy just assumed
all male models were gay.</i>

105
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,270
He was just protecting his ass.

106
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:52,394
Can't be too careful nowadays, right?

107
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,634
What's this?

108
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:09,511
Just running some blood work.
I've been feeling a little weak lately.

109
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:12,194
I thought I might have
a vitamin deficiency.

110
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:16,069
More like a self-control deficiency.
You're not 20 anymore, pal.

111
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,310
Those all-nighters are catching up to you.

112
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,799
- Here, let me.
- No.

113
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:25,677
I was always better at finding
the vein than you were.

114
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:31,157
What's going on with you?

115
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,718
Gina's HIV positive.

116
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:46,193
Well, you...

117
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,072
slept with Gina...

118
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:54,476
what, three times?
I assume you never engaged in any...

119
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:58,236
high-risk behavior with her:
multiple partners...

120
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:01,189
anal sex.

121
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,271
Wouldn't go back there
with a monkey stick.

122
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,749
Good. Then I'm sure you're fine.

123
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:09,277
The statistical probability
of you contracting the virus...

124
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:13,956
from low-risk heterosexual activity
is actually very small.

125
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:17,438
Is that why you put gloves on
to take my blood?

126
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:22,958
Look, even if you do have the virus
this isn't the '80s anymore.

127
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:26,351
The cocktail's been wildly successful
in suppressing symptoms.

128
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:30,035
- People are living for years.
- Some are, some aren't.

129
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:34,278
The media has just decided
that the stories of the living...

130
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:36,954
are more interesting
than the stories of the dying.

131
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,680
Nobody talks about the side effects
of the cocktail.

132
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:43,469
The chronic diarrhea, kidney stones,
fat redistribution.

133
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:47,030
I'm just saying
you can still have a normal life.

134
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,479
Normal life?

135
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:54,277
Do you realize what this means?

136
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:57,512
Besides having to donate
my dick to charity...

137
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:00,717
we're gonna have to reveal my status
to our patients, Sean.

138
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:06,839
Would you want an HIV-positive surgeon
operating on you?

139
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,158
Stop being my doctor.

140
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:16,112
Start being my friend.

141
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:22,755
Well, as your friend...

142
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,192
and your doctor...

143
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:29,838
I suggest you go through your BlackBerry,
you get a hold of...

144
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,276
every woman you exchanged
bodily fluids with since your exposure.

145
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,749
I'll start calling after I get my results back.

146
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,797
How long will that take? Two, three days?

147
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:41,589
How many of the women are gonna sleep
with other men during that time?

148
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:44,149
Lives are at stake here, Christian.

149
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,710
Including my mother-in-law's.

150
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:59,757
I'm here for you.
I'll help you through all of this...

151
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:03,151
good results or bad,
but you got to own up to your part.

152
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:07,313
You may not have been responsible with
the women, but you're responsible now...

153
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:10,552
for what you might have
unknowingly done to them.

154
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:07,276
Hi, Erica? It's Christian.

155
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,631
Good to talk to you, too.

156
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:14,757
Look, Erica, I'm going to cut
to the chase here.

157
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:20,272
I've been with someone who tested
HIV positive, which means I might be.

158
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,557
Which means you might be.

159
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,790
I didn't say I had it. I said she had it.

160
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:31,511
I tested myself today. I'm just saying
that maybe you should do the same.

161
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:35,594
Look, sweetheart,
don't put this exclusively on me.

162
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:38,558
You're the one who put my hand
up your skirt.

163
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,557
Why would I consider condoms?

164
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:45,952
You haven't considered a pregnancy scare
since Gabe Kaplan was a celebrity.

165
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:49,874
Yeah, well, you're full of shit, Erica.
I did not violate you!

166
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:13,879
I don't remember you asking
about my sexual history...

167
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:17,953
when you were bent over my desk
with your ass hanging out, Ms. Camden!

168
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:21,480
You don't think I'm in pain over this?

169
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:28,951
Stop crying.

170
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:37,473
Stop crying.

171
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:49,239
Stop crying.

172
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:19,716
<i>But how do we stop
attacks that are so random?</i>

173
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:22,474
<i>How do we fight an enemy so vicious?</i>

174
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:26,708
<i>One man with an answer to these
questions is Dr. Sean McNamara...</i>

175
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:29,030
<i>a plastic surgeon from Miami...</i>

176
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:32,351
<i>who dedicated his time and skills
to fix what The Carver destroys.</i>

177
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:33,873
He looks good.

178
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:37,994
Makeup, a little Vaseline on the lens,
hell, my dog looks like Demi.

179
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:39,229
Shut up.

180
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:43,311
<i>It's not for money.
You're losing thousands in OR time...</i>

181
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:44,799
<i>to help these victims gratis.</i>

182
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:48,396
<i>Well, that's just it, isn't it?
It's for the victims.</i>

183
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:52,559
Sometimes we, as a society,
have to stop just watching the news...

184
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,314
and understand that we play
a part in all this.

185
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:59,155
That we have a responsibility
to our communities to stand up and fight.

186
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:02,710
I use a scalpel to do my talking,
but we all have tools.

187
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:05,316
<i>The police report
that The Carver...</i>

188
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:08,597
<i>delivers a message to his victims
before he cuts them.</i>

189
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,990
<i>"Beauty is a curse on the world. "</i>

190
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:14,596
<i>You're a plastic surgeon.
How can you not take that personally?</i>

191
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:15,829
<i>I do.</i>

192
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:19,312
<i>Look, we all get caught up
in the myth of beauty.</i>

193
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:22,313
<i>The difference between
what The Carver does and what I do...</i>

194
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:26,439
<i>is that he's trying to make people
look as ugly as he feels on the inside.</i>

195
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:30,354
<i>I'm trying to make people as beautiful
as they feel on the inside.</i>

196
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:34,115
<i>This is Andrea Hall
reporting from Miami Beach. Back to you.</i>

197
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,753
Nurse Kimberly...

198
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,912
I've never seen anyone
take someone's temperature using that.

199
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,115
Cut.

200
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,434
Okay. It was good.

201
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:59,199
Remember what's going on here, Fantasia.
He just slept with a candy striper...

202
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,954
so this blowjob isn't to get him off.

203
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:04,396
It's to get him to love you.

204
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,358
Okay? All right.

205
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:10,149
You should take your tit out sooner
because we're not reading it on camera.

206
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:11,389
Okay.

207
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:18,589
Well, this is a pleasant surprise.

208
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:23,355
Can we talk someplace private?

209
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,074
Yeah.

210
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:31,118
You'd think that being on
a porn set all day would make you horny...

211
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:35,839
but after a couple hours, it's like
the last thing you want to do is get laid.

212
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,910
I might be HIV positive.

213
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,152
This is serious, Kimber.

214
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:52,359
- You have to get yourself tested.
- Well, I have been. Every month.

215
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:55,598
I just got my PNR/DNA results
back last week.

216
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:59,117
I mean, it's sort of
an unwritten law in this business.

217
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:02,352
HIV, chlamydia, gonorrhea.

218
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:05,154
I'm clean.

219
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,193
Thank God.

220
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:16,639
Good.

221
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:28,830
I still have one call to make.
James and Wilber.

222
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,517
I'm so sorry, Christian.

223
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:43,109
Hey.

224
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,068
It's okay.

225
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:49,117
I'm all alone, Kimber.

226
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:52,989
I've had sex with a thousand
women, but the truth is I haven't...

227
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:56,270
been intimate with a single one.

228
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:00,113
You were intimate with me.

229
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:03,750
You tried to be, at least,
and that counts for something.

230
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,911
Why are you so good to me?

231
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,150
Because I love you, Christian.

232
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:24,991
You love the idea of me.

233
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:28,994
Money, good looks, nice
things. On paper, I'm your perfect man.

234
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:32,397
But how will feel about me
when I have no hair...

235
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:36,270
and I can't eat a bowl of brown rice
without throwing up...

236
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:41,591
and I'm lying in a hospital bed
wearing a diaper?

237
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:46,429
Your heart will still be there.

238
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:48,593
And so will I.

239
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:26,992
Amazing drug, isn't it?

240
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:29,674
It's a modified form
of mivacurium chloride.

241
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:31,876
They use it on
violent psych patients.

242
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:36,158
Causes a kind of waking coma.
Should wear off in a few minutes.

243
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:39,429
It's like a plane crash, though.

244
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:43,519
A few minutes waiting
to hit the ground can feel like a lifetime.

245
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:47,355
Awful feeling.
Being totally helpless, having no control.

246
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:50,434
That's how most people
spend their lives.

247
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:53,160
Slaves to the tyranny of beauty.

248
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:58,311
Carb counting
and kickboxing classes and chemical peels.

249
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:01,355
I'm rescuing people
from all of that...

250
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:05,674
and you are destroying my work.

251
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:11,232
They call me The Carver.
I'm an artist. You are the carver.

252
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:15,829
Fifty noses all the same,
1,000 flawless breasts.

253
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,115
You're the monster...

254
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:21,114
carving what's beautiful
and real out of life.

255
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:24,316
This is my city now, Doctor.

256
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:28,794
The drugs are wearing off.
That's good.

257
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:33,632
Beauty is a curse on the world.

258
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:36,951
It keeps us from seeing
who the real monsters are.

259
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:50,113
Repair one of my masterpieces
again and the next time I'll kill you.

260
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:01,474
I didn't see his face.

261
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:04,154
He was wearing
some kind of Mardi-Gras mask.

262
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,914
I don't understand how he got in.
We have an alarm.

263
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:09,355
Looks like he broke in
through your son's bedroom...

264
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:12,830
at some point during the day,
and waited until you got home.

265
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:17,313
I'm going to put a uniform out front 24/7.
One at your office, too.

266
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,119
Let's take a look.

267
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:26,394
- Sweetheart.
- Thanks for coming over.

268
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:29,757
I didn't tell them to call you,
but I'm glad they did.

269
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:48,670
We're going to need
some fresh bandages on this.

270
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:50,068
I'll get them.

271
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:55,793
Not as bad as the others.

272
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:59,873
Angle of incision is above the
nerve. Shouldn't be too complicated to fix.

273
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:02,600
We'll drop everything,
have you on the table first thing.

274
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:05,433
I'll get Quentin Costa
from Atlanta for this.

275
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:07,670
He's the best face man
in the country.

276
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:10,991
I don't care if I have to charter a plane
to get him here myself.

277
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:12,354
Thank you.

278
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:15,474
You know I'd do it myself if I could.

279
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:25,119
- He didn't...
- No.

280
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:44,916
I can't thank you enough for coming down
on such short notice for this.

281
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:46,399
Oh, please.

282
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:50,430
After what the two of you have done
for all of these Carver victims...

283
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:52,795
it's just the least I could do.

284
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:58,076
So your office said
that you recently got back from Sudan.

285
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:00,515
That's gruesome shit over there.

286
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:04,350
These rebels, they're basically mutilating
entire villages.

287
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:08,069
I was reattaching noses and ears
that had been macheted off.

288
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:12,631
Another soldier for lost causes.
Sean is going to love you.

289
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:13,869
Don't get me wrong.

290
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:16,759
I did reward myself with a bottle
of '83 Chateau Mouton...

291
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:19,718
and a suite at the Shore Club
when I got back, so...

292
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:22,838
I have some very fond
memories of the Shore Club.

293
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:28,519
You and I need to get a drink there.
I think we could tear this town up.

294
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:31,709
Sure.

295
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:40,631
The nerve damage seems to be minimal,
so there shouldn't be any...

296
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:49,517
serious microsurgery.

297
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:53,114
Just some irrigating and grafting.

298
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:00,592
- We already discussed that, didn't we?
- Twice.

299
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:02,673
Doc, relax.

300
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:05,277
Your partner's in good hands.

301
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:07,997
He's not just my partner.

302
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:10,392
He's my best friend.

303
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:14,952
I don't want his electric razor
knowing what happened to his face.

304
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:16,189
It won't.

305
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:19,511
A man's got to look as good
as his waiting room, right?

306
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:21,193
I'm sorry, I...

307
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:25,233
This damn wrist.

308
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:29,195
I respect your skills, it's just...

309
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:33,392
having someone else work
on Sean's face is like...

310
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:36,314
having another man sleep with my wife.

311
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:39,991
I promise I'll be gentle.

312
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:55,631
How are we feeling, Doctor?
Feels weird being on this side.

313
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:58,394
I can't stop shaking from the adrenaline.

314
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:01,110
Better give me 10 cc's of Versed.

315
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:05,714
This is your day off.
Just sit back and let us do the driving.

316
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:09,909
You'll be fine, buddy.
I'll be here with you every step of the way.

317
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,433
Let's hit it.

318
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:35,039
Marking pen.

319
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:32,834
He's so big.

320
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:37,391
I think he remembers you.

321
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:43,752
Hey, Wilber.

322
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:46,795
Gabriel.

323
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:50,389
Right.

324
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:54,195
Come in.

325
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:01,390
We live in a very tight community.

326
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:04,435
Our physician lives two doors down.

327
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:08,508
It was hard enough telling
everyone that I had a child out of wedlock.

328
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:10,352
How was I supposed to explain...

329
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:15,071
that I now needed to have that child
and myself tested for AIDS?

330
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:19,958
What about Cicely?

331
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:23,190
Do we need to have her tested, too?

332
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:28,033
We haven't been that way for a long time.

333
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:35,314
Is this thing going to kill me, Christian?

334
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:44,114
I'd be shocked if you had it, James.

335
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:46,033
But if I do...

336
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:49,678
am I going to die?

337
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:56,197
Cross that bridge if we come to it, okay?

338
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:01,998
You shun your responsibility
for one night...

339
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:06,040
and you're caught in the wake forever.

340
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,038
Your turn, buddy.

341
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:22,793
Come here.
You're such a big boy.

342
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:32,788
How's he been?

343
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:35,235
Good.

344
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:39,231
Standing up on his own now.

345
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:42,117
He's talking like crazy.

346
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,672
Bottle.

347
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:48,670
Bye-bye. Dada.

348
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:58,079
What about him?

349
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:00,518
If he's sick, what are we going to do?

350
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:03,672
Chances are very low
that he contracted it from her.

351
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:05,074
<i>If he did...</i>

352
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,436
I'm sure there are good
pediatric AIDS specialists...

353
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:13,032
in Scottsdale or Phoenix.

354
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:21,914
If it's necessary, I'd like you
to be a part of his treatment.

355
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:25,117
Having a doctor you trust
and can get on the phone...

356
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:27,316
can make all the difference.

357
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:33,552
Of course I will.

358
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:42,512
How is Gina, by the way?

359
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:46,636
I don't know. She can rot.

360
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:52,356
May I give you some advice?

361
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:55,478
I have hated Gina...

362
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:58,352
cursed her many times.

363
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:02,156
But then I look at Gabriel...

364
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:05,679
and I can't help but see the good in her.

365
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:11,714
He's the one good thing she did in her life.

366
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:14,593
Sometimes one good thing is enough...

367
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:18,792
so whatever love you still feel for him...

368
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:22,353
you owe to her.

369
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:31,869
Very nice.

370
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:36,592
Dr. Costa's almost as talented
as you are, Sean.

371
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:39,399
I'm glad your practice
is in Atlanta, Dr. Costa.

372
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:42,711
Any closer, I'd be a walking ad
for the competition.

373
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:45,917
Well, I'm happy being a big fish
in my small pond.

374
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:49,638
Wouldn't dream of swimming
here with you two sharks...

375
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:52,234
unless you made me one of your own.

376
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:57,872
I'll leave you in the hands
of your capable partner, Dr. McNamara.

377
00:32:58,040 --> 00:32:59,553
Thanks again, Doctor.

378
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:01,115
Thank you.

379
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:10,873
It's safe to say you can restart
your modeling career if you want to.

380
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:16,033
Come on, partner, smile.
You're on the mend.

381
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:17,629
Am I?

382
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:21,469
Doctors.

383
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:23,115
Thank you.

384
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,831
I come bearing bad news.

385
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:29,713
We found this next to the carved face
of a teenage girl.

386
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:31,472
<i>Homecoming queen at Coral Gables Prep.</i>

387
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:35,909
Christ. That's my son's school.

388
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:37,912
He hit her last night.

389
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:40,470
Parents are a mess.
They were out to dinner.

390
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:43,632
- Why is he leaving one of our cards there?
- It's a dare.

391
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:46,155
He wants to know if we're going to fix her.

392
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:48,072
We're sure as hell not going to.

393
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:50,674
I appreciate your desire
to help these people, Sean...

394
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:53,400
but not at the price this guy's charging.

395
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:59,273
Nobody's going to think twice
if you don't want to take this girl on.

396
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:01,471
<i>But I need to let
the parents know, though.</i>

397
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:05,792
They requested you specifically. I guess
they heard the piece on the news.

398
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:10,356
<i>So are you going to do it?</i>

399
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:23,151
This really isn't necessary, Julia.

400
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:27,836
I had to pick up Annie, anyway, so I think
staying for an extra half an hour...

401
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,355
to make you something to eat...

402
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:33,194
and straighten up the place
isn't going to kill me.

403
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:35,555
Is there anything else you need?

404
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:39,948
Well, if you're asking,
could you bring me that tube of vitamin E?

405
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,069
Wow.

406
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:51,318
That looks great.

407
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:54,234
Christian really outdid himself.

408
00:34:58,240 --> 00:34:59,639
No, here, let me.

409
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:12,635
It constantly amazes me
what you plastic surgeons can do.

410
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:16,400
You guys don't get the credit you deserve.

411
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:17,595
Really?

412
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:21,157
I always thought you had issues
with what I did.

413
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:24,913
Well, honestly, Sean, I did.

414
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:31,593
Whenever I used to tell people
what my husband did for a living...

415
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:36,116
there was always a little shame behind it.

416
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:38,715
The shallowness of the industry.

417
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:42,714
How it plays into our culture.
Self-loathing. You know?

418
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:45,909
The sick person who's doing this?

419
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:50,796
I hate to admit it, but there's a bit
of truth in his message.

420
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:54,874
I've contributed to the cult of beauty.
Built this house.

421
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:57,073
My work begat his work.

422
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:59,629
No, Sean, you can't do that to yourself.

423
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:02,475
Now, I was wrong to be ashamed.

424
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:05,470
Really?
What you're doing to help...

425
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:09,155
those poor people
that that monster is mutilating...

426
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:13,029
you should be proud of yourself for that.
I'm proud of you for that.

427
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:19,190
I wish you could have felt
more of that when we were together.

428
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:24,595
Maybe I needed some perspective...

429
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:27,750
to be able to really see you.

430
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:35,191
- Is that enough?
- Yeah.

431
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:37,028
Thank you.

432
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:45,911
They want me to fix this girl
he attacked the other night.

433
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:48,116
Her parents asked for me specifically.

434
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:50,999
Her parents don't know
that he's threatened to kill you...

435
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:53,071
if you correct his work.

436
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:57,635
You think I should do the operation?

437
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:02,316
My advice would be...

438
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:05,996
to ask you what you think.

439
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:10,158
I think I'm scared.

440
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:11,795
Oh, baby.

441
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:15,751
You don't have to, you know?

442
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:19,910
- What will you think of me if I don't?
- What is the difference?

443
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:22,992
The difference is
no matter how much you hurt me...

444
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:26,755
or how disconnected we are,
I still crave your respect.

445
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:31,556
I did when I was in school,
just starting the business.

446
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:36,672
Now it's still what lifts me up.

447
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:55,230
Listen, maybe you should stay here
until they catch this guy.

448
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:58,475
You can stay in here,
I'll take Matt's room.

449
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:02,394
I think he found a way to pirate
the adult channels on his cable box.

450
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:09,349
I just don't want you out there
unprotected and alone.

451
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:16,395
But I'm not alone, Sean.

452
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:20,037
Kevin is with me.

453
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:25,916
Ready when you are, Sean.

454
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:31,159
15-blade.

455
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:58,357
- What's with this hospital pit stop?
- You tell me.

456
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:04,752
There's one doctor in the whole place,
and his third language is English.

457
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:23,838
This doesn't make sense.

458
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:26,636
You have low-grade URI but...

459
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:29,310
your white-cell count is at three.

460
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:35,750
The cocktail should have prevented
all of this.

461
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:38,309
I'm sure it would if I was taking it.

462
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:40,994
You're not taking your... Jesus, Gina.

463
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:43,475
- What, do you got a death wish?
- No.

464
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:46,036
I have no health insurance.

465
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:49,515
I guess that's the same thing.

466
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:04,151
- Why didn't you come to me?
- And beg you for money?

467
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:08,429
I hate myself, but not that much.

468
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:19,635
Bed sores?
No...

469
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:24,513
but every muscle in my body is in a knot.

470
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:28,314
Roll over.

471
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:36,234
There you go.

472
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:48,948
I'm clean.

473
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:52,875
Good.

474
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,228
That's good.

475
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:01,796
Even you don't deserve this.

476
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:09,398
I just got the results for James and Wilber.

477
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:10,789
Gabriel.

478
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:13,598
<i>They're negative.</i>

479
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,513
How did he look?

480
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:27,956
Good. Big.

481
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:32,632
He's got your eyes.

482
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:36,275
I screwed everything up, Christian.

483
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:46,230
Do you know what it's like
to lie sick in a hospital bed...

484
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:49,358
and have no one come
to visit you for days?

485
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:52,719
<i>It's not that I burned bridges, I just...</i>

486
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:55,232
never built them.

487
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:05,911
I don't want to die alone.

488
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:54,153
Remember the time
Wilber exploded all over you?

489
00:43:56,520 --> 00:43:58,238
He ruined that shirt.

490
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:02,600
That kid could crap like an Olympian.

491
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:08,079
And what about the time
we gave him his first Cheerio...

492
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:10,674
and he was flapping his arms
around like he just...

493
00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:13,149
tasted a little "O"-shaped piece of heaven?

494
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:35,794
Thank you.

495
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,228
For what?

496
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:49,315
For him.

497
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:24,550
English - SDH
