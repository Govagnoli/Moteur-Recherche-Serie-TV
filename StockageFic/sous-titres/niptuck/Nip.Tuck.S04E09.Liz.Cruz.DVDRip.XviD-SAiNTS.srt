1
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:02,315
Previously on Nip / Tuck...

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:05,676
Don't move.
Your kidney's been surgically removed.

3
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:07,398
There have been four of these thefts
in Miami.

4
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:10,517
The investigating officers think
an organized ring has moved into the area.

5
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:14,354
I need you to stay to help me through this.

6
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:19,557
I was an escort. She won't let me forget
where I came from.

7
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:22,558
What do you want? More money?

8
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:26,792
I don't want money. I want your skills.

9
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:31,789
All right.

10
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:36,755
Tell me what you don't like about yourself.

11
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:39,354
Just start at your head
and work your way down.

12
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:46,150
I just want a little lipo
and maybe some work around the eyes.

13
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:49,718
- Oh, yeah. That oughta do it.
- Shut up, Christian.

14
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:53,312
Look. Tell you the truth,
we're just a little surprised.

15
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:55,757
I mean, what happened
to the girl who believed

16
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:57,751
that real change could only come
from within?

17
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,990
You don't get points
for keeping it real anymore.

18
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:04,033
Beauty has its privileges and damn it,
I want them!

19
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:07,440
I always thought it was different
between women.

20
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:09,112
Yeah, well, maybe once upon a time.

21
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:12,875
But in this culture, trust me,
dykes today are the worst.

22
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,997
If you don't have the body
of a professional athlete,

23
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,991
then you are a loser.

24
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:22,359
Look, I almost died, okay? But I didn't.

25
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:26,796
I got a second chance
and I'm not gonna blow it by spending

26
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:30,555
the rest of my Saturday nights home,
eating Cherry Garcia.

27
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:34,759
- Couldn't the two of you just watch TV?
- Asshole.

28
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:41,636
And for your information,
my girlfriend happens to be in great shape.

29
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:46,836
Oh, I didn't know you were
seeing anybody! That's great, Liz.

30
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:49,354
I didn't read the news today.
Did hell freeze over?

31
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:54,959
Her name's Poppy,
and she's an anesthesiologist just like me.

32
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:59,793
- We've been going out for two weeks.
- Well, I don't get it, Liz. Why now?

33
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:03,516
When you've found someone who's
obviously attracted to you as you are?

34
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:07,237
I just think I'd be happier
if I looked a little better.

35
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,912
I think the whole world would be.

36
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:10,754
But don't you think it's a little risky

37
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:13,354
to put your body through another trauma
so soon after your surgery?

38
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,557
The anesthesia is the riskiest part
of the procedure, and guess what?

39
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,878
- I'm approving it.
- I agree with Christian, Liz.

40
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:22,879
Give yourself some time to heal,
maybe in a couple of months...

41
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:29,479
Gentlemen! In case you haven't noticed,
I, too, have a license to practice medicine.

42
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:34,595
Now, I could practice it here, or I could
practice it over at Mike Hamoui's,

43
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:38,719
who has offered me a permanent
staff position upon my recovery

44
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:43,316
from a state-of-the-art makeover,
which he has offered to me free of charge.

45
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:44,959
You're not seriously thinking of...

46
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,270
Come on, Lizzy. You know
you love us too much to leave us.

47
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,475
Try me.

48
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:53,034
Furthermore, I don't wanna hear
one more snide remark

49
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:57,159
about me, my girlfriend,
or my physical shortcomings.

50
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:01,075
I want the fat sucked out of me,
and I want it sucked out now.

51
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:04,554
Are you or are you not gonna do it?

52
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,309
Please.

53
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,035
No...

54
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:10,751
Classy touch, James.
Nothing sexier than a French whore.

55
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:15,116
Speaking of which,
I could use a little divertissement.

56
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,875
I've only sampled one tart
from your dessert tray,

57
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,951
and it left a lasting impression,

58
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:24,112
one that's proving
a little difficult to forget.

59
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:28,837
- I understand.
- I thought you might.

60
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:35,353
How's an hour and a half? Your place?

61
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:37,998
Top of the line, James.

62
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:42,439
I want her dazzling enough
to give my dick amnesia.

63
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:46,712
Dr. Troy, I'm certain that come morning,

64
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:50,509
Michelle will be the last thing
on your mind.

65
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:05,233
Oh, he just seems so uncomfortable,
doesn't he?

66
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:08,918
I mean, every time I tried to put him down,
he'd cry.

67
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,195
He just doesn't wanna let go of me.

68
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,669
It's probably just a reaction
from all the anesthesia.

69
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:15,876
And the fact that
he's been missing the nipple.

70
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,712
You know how that affects me.

71
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:21,269
- Good evening, all.
- Evening, Marlowe.

72
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:26,839
- How's our little guy doing tonight?
- He has just been miserable all day.

73
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:30,118
His coloring still seems
a little on the pale side.

74
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,953
All his vital signs
are perfectly within range.

75
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:35,031
Good blood flow to the fingertips.

76
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,237
A little soreness and swelling
around the incision,

77
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:40,437
which I'm sure accounts
for some of the fussiness.

78
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:42,715
But you are doing great.

79
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:45,514
Once we get these bandages off you,

80
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,512
you're gonna be better than ever.

81
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:53,675
He's making such a good recovery,
I'm thinking about calling Dr. Mugavi.

82
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:56,752
Move up the target date
for the operation on his other hand.

83
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,950
Would you like that, huh?

84
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:05,439
Get it all done as soon as possible? Yeah.

85
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:09,909
Why don't you let me take over
so you guys can go get a bite to eat?

86
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,876
I should've thought of this
before and called you.

87
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,951
I'm home a little earlier than usual,

88
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:20,474
and I haven't spent as much time with him
as I'd like.

89
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:23,313
Why don't you take the night off?
Go to the movies or something?

90
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:28,194
- Really? Are you sure because I could...
- No, go before he changes his mind.

91
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:31,397
You too, Jules.
Go to your Pilates class, get some air.

92
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:33,516
I mean, you've been stuck inside all day.

93
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:39,111
Conor and I will have a boys' night
here at the homestead.

94
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:42,798
A couple of six packs and the Dolphins.
How does that sound?

95
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,996
Okay. I'll see you guys tomorrow.

96
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,158
There's a D.K. Zhang retrospective
at the Thalia.

97
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:53,394
- Oh, God! I loved Nine Suns.
- I think that's what's playing tonight.

98
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,114
You should go, too, Jules.

99
00:08:56,920 --> 00:09:00,356
No. You know, you've been working
all day, I wouldn't feel right about...

100
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:03,398
Oh, go.
When was the last time you saw a movie?

101
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:04,709
We'll be fine.

102
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:09,591
If he's unhappy, he gets to complain
to his daddy and his doctor. Have fun.

103
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,596
I love this film. He did the entire palette
in reds and yellows and oranges.

104
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:26,514
After I saw it for the first time,
that is the only colors I could paint with.

105
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,031
You know, Julia,
I can drive you home if you want.

106
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:37,750
- You seem a bit tense.
- No, no. It's just weird being out

107
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,990
after everything that happened, that's all.

108
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:45,599
You know,
people stare and you get used to it.

109
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:53,318
- Can I help you?
- Yes, you can.

110
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,515
Two for Nine Suns, please.

111
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:02,430
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

112
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,313
Thank you. Have a nice night.

113
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:08,555
After you.

114
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:07,552
Oh, I'm sorry. I just...
I can't do this. I can't...

115
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:24,151
- Marlowe, I am so sorry.
- No, no. It's my fault. I thought...

116
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:30,318
I have feelings for you, Julia.

117
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:33,517
And they're not like
anything I have ever felt before.

118
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:39,914
I have feelings for you, too, Marlowe.

119
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:43,958
It's just that, you know, I'm married,

120
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:51,188
and everything has been really stressful
with the baby and his recovery,

121
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:55,876
and I am just really confused
about everything right now.

122
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,158
What if you weren't married?

123
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:13,115
Come on. I'll drive you home.

124
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:34,829
Sweetheart, you're two hours late.
If you were a pizza, I'd get you for free.

125
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:40,272
That's because pizza gets cold.

126
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,830
Some things get hotter
the longer you wait for them.

127
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,035
May I come in?

128
00:12:56,040 --> 00:13:00,033
You must have the wrong apartment.
I distinctly asked for something sweet.

129
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:07,150
I was going to send Campbell.
Or maybe Brianne. Then I thought, no.

130
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:10,030
Christian specifically requested
top of the line.

131
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,952
Honey, I'm not looking to bond,

132
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:15,995
so if you're here to cry boo-hoo
over Michelle and then cuddle...

133
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:19,993
Look at me, Christian.
Do I seem like the cuddly type?

134
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:23,713
- Then why are you here?
- Oh, don't be coy.

135
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:32,436
Glencullen. 21. Rare.

136
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:34,829
I'm impressed.

137
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:37,748
Go ahead, help yourself.

138
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:40,877
I'm sure I'll find another bottle
on my next trip to the Isle of Islay.

139
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:46,108
One of the heaviest and most challenging
in single malt regions.

140
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:51,674
Some love their complexity
and robustness,

141
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,796
and others find them unspeakably foul.

142
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:59,993
- Well, darling. Down the hatch.
- And up your snatch.

143
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:12,915
Let's face it, Christian.
Not every man can appreciate

144
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:16,157
the experience of a perfectly-aged,
single malt.

145
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:26,876
Smoky scent. Sweet and salty taste.

146
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:35,115
Where do you get the balls
to come on to me?

147
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:37,392
We're inevitable, you and I.

148
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,272
The same refined taste.

149
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,718
In scotch and in women.

150
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:49,117
- Don't you believe in fate?
- Only in Greek tragedy.

151
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:52,510
I believe in critical mass, in tipping points.

152
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:56,313
Tiny straws that can break camels' backs.

153
00:14:57,560 --> 00:15:01,155
You've been trying to show me who's boss
for some time, haven't you?

154
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:03,478
Well, now's your chance.

155
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:14,280
Whatcha gonna do, hit me?

156
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:20,350
Whatcha gonna do, smash in my face?

157
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:35,432
You can't, can you? That's too bad.

158
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:41,191
But then that's what gives me the power.

159
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:43,634
The fact that I can.

160
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:48,068
I feel strange.

161
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:24,320
Michelle? We have an emergency.

162
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:28,590
I'm at Christian's apartment.
Come quickly.

163
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:30,798
It's a matter of life and death.

164
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,593
He's sweet when he's sleeping.

165
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,518
He knows who you are, James.

166
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:51,228
If we take his kidney,
he'll know it was you.

167
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:53,714
Why stop at one?

168
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:58,270
I wasn't planning on leaving him alive,
anyway. I'm not a fool.

169
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,916
I know two charming Asian gentlemen

170
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,594
who are absolute magicians
at making bodies disappear.

171
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:09,318
- You wouldn't do that. Not even you.
- It's harvest time, darling.

172
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:12,749
And I am under a lot of pressure.

173
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:15,271
I've been given 24 hours
to meet my quota.

174
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:26,112
You think I'm gonna let you get away
with murdering him? I'm not a killer.

175
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:29,158
No, but your hands aren't exactly
squeaky-clean now, are they?

176
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:33,718
- What do you want me to do?
- Find me a kidney.

177
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:37,631
In 21 hours.

178
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:41,750
And I will keep him from being
the next designated donor.

179
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:45,550
There's nothing human left in you,
is there?

180
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:49,193
I'm keeping him alive, aren't I? For you.

181
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:55,391
Tick-tock. Better hurry.

182
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:25,755
Well, let's see what all the fuss is about.

183
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:39,994
Impressive.

184
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:42,434
Perhaps another time.

185
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:45,755
When you're a little more up to it.

186
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:58,829
Trust me. In another week,
you won't even miss the caffeine.

187
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:01,229
Honey, the patient is supposed to sleep
through the surgery,

188
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:02,548
not the anesthesiologist.

189
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:05,672
Once we boost that metabolism of yours,
you'll be burning energy

190
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,113
you didn't even know existed.

191
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:11,593
- She's got me in training.
- For the surgery? That's a good idea.

192
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:14,319
No. A 5K run three weeks later.

193
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:17,314
- I didn't know you ran.
- Me, either.

194
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:20,472
I think people use recovery
as an excuse to sit on their asses.

195
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:22,113
Health is a choice.

196
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:25,113
Unless someone else chooses
to steal your kidney.

197
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:29,990
Hey. What did I say about pity parties?
No time, not interested.

198
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:33,469
You are so good for me.

199
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:36,711
Isn't this the cutest face you've ever seen
in your life?

200
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:39,633
I mean, don't you just wanna eat this face
right up?

201
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:44,670
Well, don't push too hard.

202
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:46,079
I know plenty of weekend warriors

203
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:48,151
who think they're 20
and end up with coronaries.

204
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,559
- Dr. McNamara...
- Oh, no, no, no!

205
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:51,676
You call him Sean. You are family.

206
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:54,759
- Isn't she, Sean?
- Absolutely.

207
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:57,912
Sean, don't give her excuses
to cop out on herself if you really love her.

208
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,831
I mean, see her for who she is,
but you know,

209
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:01,751
support her in becoming the best
she can be.

210
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:04,149
Sean. I need to see you right away.

211
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:07,153
Christian, Christian.
Did you meet my girlfriend, Poppy?

212
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:09,708
Later, Liz. Gimme something to live for.

213
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,595
Last thing I remember is locking eyes
with that bitch. Then nothing.

214
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:20,673
Next thing I know,
I'm waking up with a massive migraine

215
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:22,671
and puking my guts out.

216
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,789
I don't understand
why you'd get a hooker in the first place.

217
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:29,350
- I was upset about Michelle.
- Right.

218
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:32,315
"Gotta have it
just as long as I can't get it. "

219
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:37,476
Why don't you just go to a bar
and pick someone up like you usually do?

220
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:40,954
I'm sure there's another mother-daughter
team out there somewhere.

221
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:42,075
Nice.

222
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:43,957
At least at a bar,
what you see is what you get.

223
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:46,110
Oh, yeah, no risk there. Just ask Lizzy.

224
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:49,317
How'd ya find this madam anyway?
The Internet?

225
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:52,554
I met her through Michelle.

226
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:57,319
Michelle was one of her girls.

227
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,675
Was this before or after
she went to medical school?

228
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:04,557
That's how she went to medical school.

229
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:08,992
- We sold our business to a hooker?
- It's in the past, Sean.

230
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:12,357
It's not something she's proud of, and
it's not something she wants advertised.

231
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:13,555
Look, she's in my blood, Sean!

232
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:16,518
That's why the bitch is trying
to destroy me. She's in her blood, too.

233
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:24,513
You were right. She drugged you.

234
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,189
Triazolam.

235
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,633
The guys from biohazard are here.

236
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:32,234
Tell them most of it's out back.
There's some in the basement.

237
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:34,833
I thought they collected
at the end of the week.

238
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:36,194
They've been on strike.

239
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:39,871
Or haven't you noticed our dumpsters
overflowing with medical waste?

240
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:43,555
We could pollute a small reservoir
with all the tissue and fat

241
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:45,437
that's been piling up out there.

242
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:50,356
So you want to report this
to the police or what?

243
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:51,919
No, I don't think so.

244
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:58,038
Just wanna take care of it myself, quietly.
Then just let it go.

245
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:14,153
Dr. McNamara,
can I speak to you for a minute?

246
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:21,429
A leg-lengthening procedure
is not something I recommend, Marlowe.

247
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:24,318
It's incredibly painful, risky
and cost prohibitive.

248
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:28,359
I understand, but I'd still appreciate
you walking me through it.

249
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:31,995
- So to speak.
- I have to ask why.

250
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:35,998
Your stance on Conor's operation
was pretty clear.

251
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:40,757
A woman that I'm involved with,

252
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:48,232
she's having some difficulty dealing
with the height disparity between us.

253
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:54,188
Well, if she needs you to put yourself
through something like this,

254
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:57,955
I strongly suggest she's not the one you
want to spend the rest of your life with.

255
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:03,437
In theory, I agree with you.
You're right, it's insane.

256
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:05,679
But so is love, you know?

257
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:14,516
I'd start by breaking the tibia
and fibula bones of both your legs.

258
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:29,078
We'd attach an external fixator device
to each half of each severed bone

259
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:33,358
using 12-inch pins that we'd insert through
small holes drilled through your skin.

260
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:39,836
Once the surgery's completed,
a small screw is turned, stretching

261
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:43,674
the fixator device to increase the distance
between both halves of each bone.

262
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:48,349
The pain is considerable since
anti-inflammatory drugs slow bone growth

263
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:50,908
and are only prescribed in emergencies.

264
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:58,032
The screws are turned four times a day
to allow new bone growth to occur

265
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:01,192
in the space between,
roughly around 1 millimeter per day.

266
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:07,073
- How many inches of growth can I expect?
- Three to six.

267
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:10,475
Sometimes less, but rarely more.

268
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:13,757
Six inches taller?

269
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:25,798
- Can I help you?
- Two for Nine Suns, please.

270
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,396
Thank you. You have a great evening.

271
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:35,595
After you.

272
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:47,875
Let's do it.

273
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:16,950
- Great. That's a start.
- Damn, I'm gonna miss those bags.

274
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:20,112
I have to throw out a whole repertoire
of luggage insults.

275
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:21,758
Well, the first time I woke up next to her,

276
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:23,637
I thought I was sleeping
with Rocky Raccoon.

277
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,198
Only puffier, this one.

278
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:29,439
Imagine rolling over
and seeing that every morning.

279
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:35,595
Well, I think that should do it.

280
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:36,915
Come on, Sean.

281
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:39,470
The whole idea was to get rid
of cellulite city,

282
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:41,278
not just raze a couple of buildings.

283
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:45,553
And while she's under, might as well take
a look at these Hadassah arms over here.

284
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,992
A couple of flaps of these puppies
and she's liable to take off.

285
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:53,918
We usually like to stick
with what the patient's requested.

286
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:56,874
Guys, she's not in here for her health.
Come on.

287
00:25:57,320 --> 00:26:01,677
- This is exactly what she'd want.
- Right. What she wants.

288
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:04,396
Listen, I'm not having her come
down to the Keys with me

289
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:05,754
looking like a Teletubby, all right?

290
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:08,189
This is like Michelangelo and the David.

291
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:10,555
We're just whittling away
at anything that isn't the true Liz.

292
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,676
I think we're done whittling away
for today.

293
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:16,673
If she wants anything else done,
it's not like she has to make a special trip.

294
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:18,917
I got a lunch date. Later.

295
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:26,993
I think Christian's right.
We did what Liz asked for.

296
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:32,038
If she needs additional work,
she certainly knows where to find us.

297
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,914
I can never figure out
what comes first with guys.

298
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,150
Inflated ego or the small penis.

299
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:18,318
Bonjour, James.

300
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:23,597
I had so much fun the other night,
I thought maybe we should do it again.

301
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:28,234
- Care for some lunch?
- I'm gonna be sick.

302
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:31,956
It must be going around.
I was puking my guts out this morning.

303
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,038
Might've been something I drank.

304
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:36,830
When I finally woke up,
I thought I'd been robbed,

305
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:38,592
but everything was there.

306
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:44,114
But then I noticed something in the air,
and I recognized the scent.

307
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:47,590
L 'air du French cooch.

308
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:51,395
You're disgusting! That car is worth
more than $100,000!

309
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:54,916
A woman who won the lottery paid me
four times that much to ride my dick.

310
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:59,036
Which means, sweetheart,
you owe me 300,000 bucks.

311
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:02,719
Wait. Wait!

312
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:13,391
I have a girl who was offered a comparable
amount by an appallingly rich Saudi.

313
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:19,672
Perhaps if I send her to you,
we might call this even.

314
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:24,597
Why the sudden turnaround, James?
Scared of a little medical waste?

315
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:26,989
Afraid your living room might end up
like your Mercedes?

316
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:34,078
It's insane for us both to fight over a prize
neither of us could win.

317
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:40,238
- It's a peace offering.
- Peace offering?

318
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:46,396
She better be one hell of a piece.

319
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,068
Am I beautiful?

320
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:59,756
- I always thought so.
- Where's Poppy?

321
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:03,799
- I wanna know what she thinks.
- I'm really proud of you, Liz.

322
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:08,398
Changing your attitude,

323
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:11,670
realizing that you deserve someone

324
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:16,038
because you're so lovable and great.

325
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:20,073
What's going on with you?
Did you nick a vein or something?

326
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:23,118
No! No, no. Just...

327
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:29,431
You decided to find yourself a girlfriend
and poof! Poppy appeared.

328
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:33,675
- You hate her.
- No, I don't! I mean, who? Poppy?

329
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:37,759
- Did she say something?
- No! I mean...

330
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:40,190
She may have been a little
on the critical side, but...

331
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:41,918
Of who? Of me?

332
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:46,677
Well, it's just that she wants me to be
the best me I can be.

333
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:52,638
I mean... What did she say?
That she was stuck with a big old fat pig?

334
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:54,669
No.

335
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:58,878
- Oh, my God.
- You're putting words in my mouth.

336
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:01,918
Well, someone better,
because the ones you're not saying suck.

337
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:08,510
- That woman loves me, Sean.
- Of course she does.

338
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:10,678
You are very lovable.

339
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:15,315
And look, it's just me. It's me.

340
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:19,432
I think I'm being overprotective.

341
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:26,432
She was a little pushy in the OR,
and I overreacted.

342
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,189
Hey.

343
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:37,798
I'm really happy for you.

344
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:43,798
And if Poppy is the girl for you,
then she's family.

345
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:49,670
- How's my baby doing?
- Great. Just perfect.

346
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:57,438
I'll give you two some privacy.

347
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:02,994
And no monkey business
till she's out of recovery.

348
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:08,795
He's okay.

349
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:10,598
A little on a conservative side
for a surgeon,

350
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:12,910
but, you know,
much less of a pig than that other one.

351
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,718
Why? What did he do?

352
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:18,588
It's more really about what he didn't do,
but you know what? It doesn't matter.

353
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:21,592
We'll just go back in, in another month,
and we'll do some more, right?

354
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:23,079
I'll take care of it, so...

355
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:26,948
Hey, push over.

356
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:30,959
- You okay?
- Yeah.

357
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:05,915
- That woman in the waiting room...
- Pretty, isn't she?

358
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:09,520
A little gift from our good friend James.

359
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:11,918
Since I couldn't get what I wanted,

360
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,150
she thought she'd help compensate
for my loss.

361
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:17,198
Christian, don't do this.

362
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:20,632
Don't accept favors from James.
She's not to be trusted.

363
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:21,875
And your husband is?

364
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:28,114
But what the hell? You've made
your choice and now I'm making mine.

365
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:31,152
Do you think I chose to stay with Burt
to hurt you?

366
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:34,552
Do you have any idea
what my life has been like?

367
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:37,874
I'm 30 years old.

368
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:41,631
I sleep next to a man
who I have to feed and clean...

369
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:46,032
Just how much money could he be
leaving you, Mrs. Landau? A billion?

370
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,195
Because after everything
he's put you through,

371
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:53,112
you couldn't possibly owe that old bastard
a single thing.

372
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:59,073
You wanna sacrifice yourself from some
false sense of wifely obligation, go ahead.

373
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:02,152
- You'll die a rich martyr.
- Christian, please.

374
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:06,756
But I'm way past shooting for sainthood,
sweetheart.

375
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:13,830
God gave me a dick and I intend
to glorify him by playing that organ

376
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:20,309
as intensely and as often as possible.

377
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:24,709
Hello.

378
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:29,589
Let's go.

379
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:53,750
- Hey.
- Hey.

380
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:56,878
- I didn't hear you come in.
- Well, I didn't wanna wake Conor.

381
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:00,437
I think he's finally out.

382
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:03,037
We'll see how long that lasts.

383
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:08,994
You know,
he's probably scared of this thing.

384
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:11,152
Maybe we should paint over it.

385
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:12,912
Put something less weird in its place.

386
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,434
Marlowe thinks
it's actually quite good for him.

387
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:20,355
Marlowe is a capable night nurse, Julia,
who certainly talks a good game.

388
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:23,074
When it comes down to it,
he's kind of full of shit.

389
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:24,793
What are you talking about?

390
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:28,589
Guess who came into my office to discuss
a leg-lengthening procedure?

391
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:32,798
I don't understand. Why would he...

392
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:36,475
Apparently, he's in love with someone
who's got a problem with him being short.

393
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:39,949
So much for all that self-acceptance crap.

394
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:46,389
It must be that dancer,
the Miami ballet, he told me about.

395
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:48,999
Talk about hypocrisy, huh?

396
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:52,478
I told him
it's an incredibly painful procedure.

397
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:54,551
They have to cut the bones,
put a brace on,

398
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:56,358
turn a screw to force the bones apart...

399
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:58,112
Isn't that what you did to Conor?

400
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:04,317
It's not the same, Julia!
A baby's bones aren't completely formed.

401
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,789
The whole recovery process
is much easier...

402
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:10,669
I'll get him.

403
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:20,157
Come here. It's okay. It's okay.

404
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:24,317
Could you give me a pacifier?
Try to distract him?

405
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:27,799
Just rock him and maybe he'll fall asleep.

406
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:31,077
I can't. I need to turn the screw.

407
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,151
I have to get some air,
take a walk or something.

408
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:40,279
I'm sorry,
but I just can't watch you do this.

409
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:51,759
It's okay.

410
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:59,599
It's okay, it's okay.

411
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:31,431
Can I come in?

412
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,359
Hey.

413
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:53,075
It's not exactly Hieronymus Bosch.

414
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:56,869
I just can't seem to get
the colors quite right.

415
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:09,032
I don't want you to get
the procedure done.

416
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:12,669
The leg-lengthening. Not for me.

417
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:20,190
I'm not just doing it for you.
I'm doing it for us.

418
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:26,074
There is no us, Marlowe. I am married.
I've told you.

419
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:27,513
I know.

420
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:31,477
But you may not be forever.

421
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:39,268
Look, Julia, I have never thought
about doing something like this before.

422
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:41,233
It's just...

423
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:45,836
It's just that every other way,
we're a perfect fit.

424
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:52,638
And I just don't want the physical
difference between us to stand in the way.

425
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:57,151
How could you even think that?

426
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:02,519
Whatever happens between me and Sean,

427
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:07,596
there's not one thing
that I would change about you.

428
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:10,469
Not one.

429
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,275
- Marlowe.
- I know.

430
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:41,794
You have to go home.

431
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:04,359
Mrs. Landau. Oh, I'm sorry, dear.
I didn't mean to startle you.

432
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:09,195
I'm just a little on edge.
It's been a difficult day.

433
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:11,870
For Mr. Landau, too, I'm afraid.

434
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:16,476
I gave him his heparin over an hour ago,
and his blood pressure is still 180 over 90.

435
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:19,469
- I'd be happy to stay the night.
- No.

436
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:23,472
That's very sweet of you, Frances,
but I can handle it.

437
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:28,312
But if he has any more trouble breathing
or he complains of chest pains...

438
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:29,753
I said I can handle it.

439
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:34,510
- Now, go and enjoy your evening.
- Good night.

440
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:37,959
Darling, is that you?

441
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:42,916
Yes, Burt. I'll be right up.

442
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:15,359
I'll need to be able to use those
in the morning. I have a rhinoplasty.

443
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:21,793
Where the hell have you been?

444
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:25,876
Oh, God, I feel like shit.

445
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:27,957
My heart's racing a mile a minute.

446
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:31,990
I'll... I'll get you your beta blocker.

447
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:36,838
Now, where did Frances put them?

448
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:42,316
- I'll go look for them.
- No, no, wait a minute! Come back here!

449
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:43,949
Come on.

450
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:49,675
Please. Come over and sit by me.
Come on.

451
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:56,630
That's right. Keep me company.

452
00:40:57,880 --> 00:40:59,916
That's the best medicine there is.

453
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:03,073
Come on, a little closer.

454
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:08,349
Now show me.

455
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:14,070
Come on, honey,
let me nuzzle them a little bit.

456
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:17,597
I don't really think
you should excite yourself right now, Burt.

457
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:19,992
Shit, you're probably right.

458
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:24,990
Let this be a lesson. Never buy a used car.

459
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:27,518
Once you drive it off the lot,

460
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:30,512
one damn thing after another
starts to fall apart.

461
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:34,197
It's been a sweet ride though, hasn't it?

462
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:36,869
Sweet?

463
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:40,318
No, Burt, it hasn't.

464
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:49,359
It stopped being sweet the day you
forced me to make love to another man

465
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:50,555
in front of you.

466
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:54,554
Whatever love I had for you died that day.

467
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:58,110
You don't do that to someone you love.

468
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:01,110
You do that to something you own.

469
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:03,471
Marriage is a contract, darling.

470
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:07,598
What's mine is yours,
and what's yours is mine.

471
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:09,272
You knew I loved Christian!

472
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:11,955
And all your money and power
couldn't change that!

473
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:13,393
Well, you're here, aren't you?

474
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:16,675
If it wasn't the money and power,
why'd you stay?

475
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:21,152
I stayed because I pitied you.

476
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:27,273
Get my pills.

477
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:31,670
The little white ones. Come on.
Please! Where are they?

478
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:34,908
They're in the living room.

479
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:45,554
I'll get it myself.

480
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:12,873
Oh. Easy, baby. Better hold that thought.

481
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:15,071
Unless you're into golden showers.

482
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:11,954
Okay! Now, where were we?

483
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:27,075
Jules?

484
00:45:33,120 --> 00:45:34,599
That was a long walk.

485
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:41,233
Yeah, I sat by the ocean
and looked at the waves.

486
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:42,789
I think it helped.

487
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:45,998
By yourself, at night?

488
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:51,791
I don't wanna lie to you, Sean.

489
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:55,797
I was at Marlowe's.

490
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:00,513
Marlowe? What for?

491
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:07,431
He's my friend.
I wanted someone to talk to.

492
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:09,034
Process things.

493
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:14,315
