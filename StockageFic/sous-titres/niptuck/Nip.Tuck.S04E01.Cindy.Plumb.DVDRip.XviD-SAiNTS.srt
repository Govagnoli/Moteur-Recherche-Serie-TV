1
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:42,078
His-and-her face lifts.

2
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:46,359
If this is indicative of the state
of relationships in the 21st century,

3
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:47,509
then I'm staying single.

4
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,751
And cocker spaniels
all over South Florida howl in relief.

5
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:55,913
I admire the Cohens.

6
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:58,355
They want to stay attractive to each other
as they age,

7
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:00,237
keep the intimacy in their marriage alive.

8
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:03,835
Why shouldn't they look as young
and vital as the love they feel?

9
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:11,274
- I'm closed.
- Get over here, I'm lonely.

10
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:20,751
How many of these
would you say we've done?

11
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:22,956
I don't know. A couple of thousand?

12
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,315
Try five.

13
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:38,989
Four thousand, nine hundred ninety-nine.

14
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:41,670
- Five thousand.
- No shit.

15
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,033
To 5,000 more.

16
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:49,792
And they said it wouldn't last.

17
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:54,078
Come over for dinner tomorrow night.

18
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:57,197
Let's expand this celebration,
make it a family affair.

19
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:01,878
The only way I wanna celebrate is
with a nice big slice of hair pie.

20
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:06,677
Celebration aside, I want
some alone time with you this week.

21
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:09,433
We need to come up with a plan
for the next 10 years

22
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,238
so we firmly know where we're going.

23
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:12,878
Julia and I did it
when we got back together,

24
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,075
and now look at us.

25
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,798
Tighter than we've ever been.

26
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:20,315
Not everybody has what you have, Sean.

27
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:22,239
Absolut, neat.

28
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:23,829
Thanks.

29
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,116
I know you're struggling, Christian.

30
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:28,919
Everything you've been through
with Kimber, I know.

31
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,433
But the only way
you're gonna start to feel better

32
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,590
is to get close to someone again.

33
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:39,198
I couldn't agree more.

34
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:42,156
Can we buy you gentlemen a drink?

35
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,354
Absolutely.

36
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:48,234
I'm Christian Troy, this is Sean McNamara.

37
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:50,948
We're doctors.

38
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,592
We're Jill and Riley White.

39
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:57,559
- Sisters?
- Aren't you sweet.

40
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:00,918
Mom, can I get that credit card
to pay the bartender?

41
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,991
Thanks for the offer,

42
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,275
but I'm gonna go home
and make love to my wife.

43
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:14,635
And then I'm gonna propose to her.

44
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:22,111
Oh, a family man. That's so sweet.

45
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:24,675
Yeah.

46
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:27,752
Yeah, if there's one thing
that Dr. McNamara and I agree on,

47
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:33,592
it's the importance of family.

48
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:37,709
Shots!

49
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:51,119
Sweetie, the way the baby's sitting,
it's making me really gassy.

50
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:53,031
Can I give you a rain check?

51
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:54,829
Sure.

52
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,837
Oh, yeah! Yes!

53
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:07,037
Yeah! Yeah. That's good.
Oh, yeah. Harder!

54
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,548
Mr. Landau, tell me
what you don't like about yourself.

55
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:32,756
Well, if I had to pick one thing,

56
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:36,477
it'd be that I didn't meet
my lovely bride here sooner.

57
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:41,436
How long have you two been married?

58
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,519
Almost a year now.

59
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:46,396
I proposed the first night we met.

60
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:48,550
She kept me waiting a whole week.

61
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:52,513
But she saved my life.

62
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:54,558
Literally saved my life.

63
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:57,153
And what brings you here today?

64
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:00,232
My balls are no longer proportionate
to my wang.

65
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:05,355
Burt was diagnosed with late-stage
prostate cancer six months ago.

66
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,752
Aside from the radiology treatments,

67
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:11,037
our doctor recommended
he have a bilateral orchiectomy.

68
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,271
You had both testes removed?

69
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,995
And you're not happy
with the size of your implants now?

70
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,229
Lord, no.

71
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:21,549
Feels like I got an SUV riding around
on training wheels down there.

72
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:24,397
How much bigger would you like to go?

73
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:26,277
How about kiwi-sized, huh?

74
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:29,514
That's how
you first described them to me.

75
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:34,517
All my life I had a pair
that made me feel like a man.

76
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:36,033
I made my living

77
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:38,839
eating up pet shops
and shitting out circuses.

78
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:41,036
My husband's a medical venture capitalist.

79
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:44,908
Landau Industries can take
a half-assed HMO or radiology lab

80
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,873
and make it profitable in six months.
Six months!

81
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:50,038
Now, brains...

82
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:52,395
Brains can help you
recognize an opportunity,

83
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:56,837
but it is balls that make you a risk-taker.

84
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:01,397
And these 10-year-old-boy pits
I got down there,

85
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:03,158
they're sucking out all my oomph.

86
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:05,708
I told him
that doesn't matter to me anymore.

87
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,756
His health is what's important.

88
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,151
To go through another operation
this year is crazy to me.

89
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:15,312
Have you been intimate
with your husband since the operation?

90
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,435
Yes.

91
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:19,034
I think I would have
remembered that, honey.

92
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:22,074
Real intimacy isn't just about sex, Burt.

93
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:26,115
It's about me holding your head up
when you puked from the chemo.

94
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:29,678
It's about being man enough
to be vulnerable with me.

95
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:32,434
What about your sex life
before the operation?

96
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:37,000
What sort of details
are you interested in, Dr. Troy?

97
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:39,355
We did it four times a week. At least.

98
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:41,509
Right?

99
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,198
And that was enough for you?

100
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:45,749
What?

101
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,479
I think what my partner is getting at

102
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,790
is we'd like to gauge
what each of your expectations are

103
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:53,519
- before we schedule a procedure.
- Exactly.

104
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:57,511
Well, I told you.
I wanna go back to being the man I was.

105
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,274
Now, trust me, honey.

106
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,112
Once I get those boys back,

107
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,350
we're both gonna be much, much happier.

108
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:19,790
I've been feeling fine, actually.

109
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,790
Yeah, nothing different, really,

110
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:25,394
than I remember feeling
with Matt and Annie.

111
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:27,516
Maybe less appetite.

112
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,958
Does the baby look...

113
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:38,639
- Is everything all right?
- Oh, it's a boy.

114
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:47,435
It's also what I was afraid of, Julia.

115
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:52,071
I wish we could have made
a definitive evaluation earlier.

116
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:57,314
But with something like this,
the baby's size and the rotated position,

117
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,879
the bones still forming,

118
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:02,509
it often takes until the second trimester
to be absolutely sure.

119
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:06,918
And are you sure?

120
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:10,633
When you discussed
the possibility of this with Sean...

121
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:14,429
No, I didn't discuss it with him.

122
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:18,514
I mean,

123
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:22,550
I didn't wanna worry him
in case it turned out to be nothing.

124
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:25,720
I knew that I wanted this baby
no matter what.

125
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:31,553
And I was afraid that he wouldn't.
So I didn't say anything.

126
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:33,558
I know it's not my place, Julia,
but I think...

127
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:36,791
No. You know what? It's not your place.

128
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:40,278
You know, I'm sorry,
but this is very complicated.

129
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:46,268
There are people that you can talk to

130
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:48,191
that have lived with this

131
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,390
and lead happy and successful lives.

132
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,197
I think it would give you some relief.

133
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,119
I love your pad.

134
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:19,593
None of that metrosexual, pseudo-hip,
Design within Reach crap.

135
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:22,714
Yeah, you know, it usually takes a gay guy

136
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:26,190
to put together
a place as fashion-forward as yours.

137
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:29,274
A little less teeth down there, sweetheart.

138
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:31,629
Sorry.

139
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:33,709
Kids.

140
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:36,794
- Let Mommy, honey.
- I can do it, Mom!

141
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,996
I'm sure you can, sweetie.

142
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:42,709
It's just I was sucking dick
when you were sucking on a pacifier.

143
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,837
Watch and learn.

144
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:56,238
God! She's always telling me what to do.

145
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:59,198
Parents can be tough.

146
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:02,635
Yeah, it's cool, though.

147
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:06,749
We don't get to hang out together
as much since nursing school started,

148
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:09,559
so this is our only real
mother-daughter time.

149
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:13,871
You guys do this together a lot?

150
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:17,710
Ever since I was 16.

151
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,669
She caught me with my stepdad.

152
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:32,718
Mom, he won't kiss me.

153
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:39,436
Some guys just don't like to be kissed
after oral sex, sweetheart.

154
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:42,273
But he didn't kiss me
the other night, either.

155
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,679
Did he kiss you?

156
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:51,476
So our tongues are good enough
to go in your ass

157
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:52,788
but not your mouth?

158
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:55,270
Certainly not one after the other.

159
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:57,988
What kind of guy
doesn't want to be kissed?

160
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:01,031
The kind I warned you about.

161
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:03,152
Just like your father.

162
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:06,357
Do you know what kind of women
accept not being kissed?

163
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,309
Whores.

164
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:10,433
We're not whores.

165
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:13,914
No, you're the goddamn
Mother of the Year.

166
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,635
Get out.

167
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:21,470
This is too screwed up, even for me.

168
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:25,315
I'm not gonna be judged
by people like you.

169
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:26,469
What,

170
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,630
you think you're different than us?

171
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:31,109
There are three people
in this room, honey,

172
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,838
and you're playing, too.

173
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:36,355
Riley, get dressed. We're out of here.

174
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:49,677
You know, Mom and I might have our
problems, but at least we have each other.

175
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:52,349
Which is exactly the way
Mommy likes it, sweetheart.

176
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:55,000
Maybe if you let her keep the key
to your snatch long enough,

177
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:57,674
you'll be just as bitter and screwed up
when you turn 40.

178
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:58,749
Of course, by then she'll be 60,

179
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:00,751
so don't be surprised
if she takes you cruising for dates

180
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:03,798
down at the early bird special
at Long John Silver's.

181
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:05,313
Yeah, and you'll be there, too,

182
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,192
sitting by yourself.

183
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:14,590
You are so afraid of connecting,

184
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,197
you're destined to die alone.

185
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:20,999
Come on, honey.

186
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:34,510
The mushrooms are on the bottom shelf,
honey, behind the yogurt.

187
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,429
What?

188
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:46,034
You look beautiful.

189
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:49,396
You got that beautiful mother's glow
about you.

190
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:56,799
It's called retaining water.
My feet are so swollen I can barely walk.

191
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:04,550
- So what are we cooking?
- We have Chicken Tetrazzini.

192
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,632
Annie saw it on Rachael Ray.

193
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,751
It's kind of Mom's and my thing.

194
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,393
Well, it sounds yummy.

195
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:11,959
Smells good.

196
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:14,675
- Where's Mattie?
- He's in the garage.

197
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:17,071
Still? It's been over two hours.

198
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:18,593
Sweetheart, just let him be.

199
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:21,240
It's a family dinner, Julia.
That means all the family.

200
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:22,878
He'll come when he's ready.

201
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:26,389
Right?

202
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:31,079
Sweetie, why don't you let me finish
getting dinner ready

203
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:34,391
while you and your dad go and practice
the school play?

204
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:37,071
She got the lead in Puss in Boots.

205
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:39,310
- Puss in Boots?Wow!
- Yeah, come look.

206
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,832
I've come to see the King.

207
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,556
But you are merely a cat.

208
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:53,950
What business could you possibly have
with His Royal Highness?

209
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:56,838
I bear gifts from the Marquis of Carabas.

210
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:59,196
I have never heard of this Marquis.

211
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:01,032
How will you explain to your king

212
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:04,715
that you stopped a very important man
from talking to him?

213
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:08,319
Please forgive me.

214
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:11,278
I will announce your arrival
to His Royal Highness.

215
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:14,598
There I was, just staring at them,
the two of them.

216
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,950
The connection between them was...

217
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:23,508
I don't know.

218
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:27,354
I don't think I've ever felt
that kind of closeness before.

219
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:34,629
Good.

220
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:36,914
You've been sitting there for 30 minutes,

221
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,913
and that's the first time you've been
able to articulate why you're here.

222
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:42,792
"Why now?" is the question.

223
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:46,034
Well, I told you.
I was staring at Sean, and...

224
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:47,474
Nothing else?

225
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:53,038
I mean, in general,
your life was working relatively well.

226
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:57,238
Successful practice,
and according to your own estimation,

227
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:01,595
you've "screwed hundreds
of the hottest asses in South Beach. "

228
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,113
Why ask for help now?

229
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:14,432
Sean and I recently celebrated
5,000 surgeries,

230
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:20,433
and to reward my accomplishments,
I picked up a couple of gals

231
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:24,319
and screwed them
until my dick almost fell off.

232
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:30,278
Fifteen years ago, I celebrated
our first surgery the same way.

233
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:35,233
Have you ever had
any loving adult relationships?

234
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:40,355
Yeah, sure.

235
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:42,714
What happened?

236
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:46,156
One of them married Sean, and the other...

237
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:47,753
I don't know.

238
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:49,478
It just didn't work out.

239
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:51,759
Wasn't my fault.

240
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:54,714
Even Sean couldn't make it work with her.

241
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:56,315
I see.

242
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,555
And your recent celebratory sex.

243
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:01,358
How would you describe it?

244
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:03,870
I could demonstrate, if you're interested.

245
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:07,794
Christian, I'm not interested
in getting off on your sexual exploits.

246
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,230
I'm interested in understanding them.

247
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:14,431
Tell me about when you climax.

248
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:17,990
Do you look into your partner's eyes?

249
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:23,237
We're not exactly face to face,
if you get the picture.

250
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:29,954
Women who wanna play kissy-face
and gaze into someone's eyes

251
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:31,758
should find themselves a lesbian.

252
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:35,039
Watching your lover
give themselves to you

253
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:38,715
and allowing them to witness your
own surrender is a shared connection.

254
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:41,553
It takes trust, courage,
to be that vulnerable.

255
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:45,156
When you climax behind her back,
her identity doesn't matter.

256
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:47,555
She's just a substitute for your hand.

257
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:51,269
My hand never made me buy it dinner
and cuddle afterwards.

258
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:53,078
It's a power position.

259
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:55,276
Taking someone else's power
and using it for your own...

260
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,078
You know what? So is this.

261
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,079
It's ridiculous.

262
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:00,795
How much are you overcharging me?

263
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,552
I'm forcing you
to take an honest look at your behavior,

264
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:05,359
since there doesn't seem to be
anyone else in your life willing to do that.

265
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,908
Actually, Sean does that,
thank you very much.

266
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:11,914
Oh, yes, the man who has everything
you wish you had.

267
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,439
He's my best friend.

268
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:16,114
He doesn't demand anything in return,

269
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:18,316
like every other goddamn woman
I've ever been with.

270
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:19,435
I don't have to take care of him.

271
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:22,398
I don't have to take care
of his fragile little ego.

272
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,229
How much?

273
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:30,439
So you do have intimacy in your life
after all.

274
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:35,638
Maybe the reason your relationships
with women keep failing

275
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:37,358
is because you're taken.

276
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,150
What the hell are you talking about?

277
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:45,114
Have you ever considered the possibility
that you're in love with your partner?

278
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:07,549
Christian?

279
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:11,350
Come in here and check out my balls.

280
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:15,671
The shipment of Neuticles
for the Landau surgery arrived.

281
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,596
Which do you think would be appropriate?

282
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:22,149
I don't know. Ask him, they're his balls.

283
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,959
I know, but the ones he has now
are 22 cc's.

284
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:26,871
He said they were too small.

285
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,671
I don't think mine are
anything to be ashamed of,

286
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:32,069
and they're about that size.

287
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:33,993
Look at these 40s.

288
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:37,229
I don't know about you,

289
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:38,753
but I always thought
the size of a man's testes

290
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:40,671
was secondary to proportion.

291
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:44,196
I mean, you could sink the Bismarck
with these things, right?

292
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:46,468
Yours this big?

293
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:50,069
Huh?

294
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:52,271
- Jesus, Sean.
- Are they?

295
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:53,629
What's the matter?

296
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:56,996
Nothing. I just don't feel like playing
with your toy nuts, that's all.

297
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:59,878
They're not toys, Christian,
they're our future.

298
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:05,036
Do you realize that over 3,500
of the 5,000 surgeries we've done

299
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,269
have been cosmetic?

300
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:07,588
Yeah, I looked it up.

301
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:10,956
That's 70% of our OR time
spent on boob jobs and lipo,

302
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:13,713
and only 30% on cases like the Landaus.

303
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,470
Let's flip that ratio for the next 5,000.

304
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:21,117
Thirty percent cosmetic,
seventy percent reconstructive.

305
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:24,072
We have the skill to do it.

306
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:26,511
Now all we need are the balls.

307
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,949
Did you ever think
I might like doing tit jobs?

308
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:46,032
Tell me what you don't like
about yourself, Ms. Plumb.

309
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:47,919
I want a voice lift.

310
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:53,432
You'll make an incision,
implant some Gore-Tex, right?

311
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:56,674
And then the youthfully re-tightened
vocal cords

312
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:58,478
eliminate the wobbles, tremors,

313
00:22:58,560 --> 00:22:59,549
and in some cases,

314
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:01,358
raise the voice an octave.

315
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:03,398
You've done your research.

316
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:06,319
Are you a singer, or an actress, or...

317
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:09,070
"Cindy Plumb can make you cum

318
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:13,878
"in English, Spanish,
Mandarin and Japanese.

319
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:17,750
"You may be alone,
but you're not on your own. "

320
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:22,556
I'm a phone-sex artist.

321
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:25,748
I've been getting people off for 15 years.

322
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:32,112
Dr. Graham is a specialist
who does voice rehabilitation.

323
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:36,352
We don't like to cut into the larynx
unless it's a last resort.

324
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:39,792
- So he'll work with you and if that fails...
- As you know, Doctor,

325
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:41,029
time is money.

326
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:43,789
And my clients deserve the best.

327
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,518
I'll be honest with you.

328
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:55,229
From the rosacea and the thread veins
in your nasal area,

329
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:57,390
I'd guess you're a heavy drinker.

330
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:00,831
And your skin quality suggests
you're at least a pack-a-day smoker.

331
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:04,356
- Both those addictions affect your voice...
- I'm way ahead of you, Doc.

332
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:07,716
I'm off the booze,
and I just started on the patch.

333
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:13,192
It's been a long road, huh?

334
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:15,996
My marriage fell apart 17 years ago.

335
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:19,358
I couldn't give my husband
what he needed sexually.

336
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:23,472
Don't you love the irony?

337
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:26,351
I truly thought I would die.

338
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:29,310
I'd pour myself a big glass of bourbon

339
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:31,516
and call up one of those chat lines.

340
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:33,839
I was very lonely.

341
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:37,120
And then one night,
sitting there alone, I discovered

342
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,714
I wasn't just a sad, dumped first wife,

343
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:42,879
I was a goddamn sensual goddess.

344
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:45,433
That's how it works.

345
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:47,518
You may not get what you want,

346
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,272
but you get what you need.

347
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:52,799
Now I have a life
full of these extraordinary men

348
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:54,757
who know that there is nobody

349
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:56,512
as smoking hot

350
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,119
as yours truly.

351
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:02,193
I provide a connection
they can't get at home.

352
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:06,232
I save marriages now, I don't lose them.

353
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:13,360
- How long have you been sober?
- Two years.

354
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,317
And that's another irony.

355
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:18,517
I'm clearer now and better at what I do
than I ever have been.

356
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:22,798
But now that I sound
like a geriatric bullfrog,

357
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:25,030
thanks to the booze and the ciggies,

358
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:28,672
a lot of my regular clients
aren't calling as often.

359
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:37,069
Any ideas on how you'd like to sound?

360
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:45,999
Baby, you sound so good today.

361
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:48,192
Where's your hand, baby?

362
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:51,230
That's Mr. Chin, an accountant.

363
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:53,558
He's been with me for eight years.

364
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:55,153
That's it, baby.

365
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:57,113
Are you hard, baby?

366
00:25:57,920 --> 00:26:02,038
'Cause I'm all plumped up and juicy
just thinking about you.

367
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:05,951
Are you hard, baby?

368
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:09,350
'Cause I'm all plumped up and juicy
just thinking about you.

369
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:13,513
Oh, come on, Doc.

370
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:16,710
Give me back the real Cindy, huh?

371
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:25,515
- Where the hell is Christian?
- I'm sure his spirit's here

372
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,352
and it's just his body
that's still in the tanning booth.

373
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:30,000
- How long's she been under?
- I wouldn't wait much longer.

374
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:32,036
Get Christian on the Batphone.

375
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:39,958
- Hello?
- Where are you?

376
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:42,235
We have a patient prepped
and on the table.

377
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:44,470
I thought you said
our FeatherLift rescheduled.

378
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:48,030
And then I also told you that I
scheduled a laryngoplasty in its place!

379
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:50,156
I'm in the dentist's chair
getting a power bleaching.

380
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:52,754
So you're gonna have
to go ahead without me.

381
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:56,235
Okay, now, where were we?

382
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:57,913
You were saying
you were no longer happy

383
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,639
with the overly-styled,
metrosexual esthetic.

384
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,631
If you could be more specific.

385
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,916
Well, for example, the bedding.

386
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:09,829
- It's far too...
- Soft.

387
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:13,875
Yeah, soft. And the drapes,
the drapes are too filmy.

388
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:17,188
In other words,
you want me to butch it up.

389
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:19,671
Yeah. Yeah, butch it up.

390
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:04,993
Slowly bring her out.

391
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:13,549
Cindy, I need you to repeat after me, okay?

392
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:16,318
"She speaks pleasingly. "

393
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:21,638
She speaks pleasingly.

394
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:26,071
I wanna shave off just a hair.

395
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:37,594
The day Dr. Allenby told me
I had a 50-50 chance

396
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:40,877
of passing these beauties
down to my kids,

397
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:44,916
she also promised she would support
whatever decision I came to.

398
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:47,630
My coin came up tails each time.

399
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:48,948
Both kids have it.

400
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:55,793
Did it make you waver at all
in your decision

401
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:59,429
when you found out
that they had electrodact...

402
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,511
- Ectrodactyly.
- Sorry.

403
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:03,830
I know. Clumsy word, hard to pronounce.

404
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:07,151
But it's a hell of a lot better
than Lobster Claw Syndrome!

405
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,799
Yeah, I wavered.

406
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,188
But ultimately,

407
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:15,956
I decided they had every right to be here

408
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:17,393
and be different.

409
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:23,559
Was it hard as a child
to make the adjustments?

410
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:27,874
Physically, you figure it out.
Like standing and walking.

411
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:31,238
Emotionally, bit by bit.

412
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:32,715
Because, really,

413
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:36,475
it's the rest of the conventional world
that makes you feel handicapped.

414
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:43,391
And has it affected your ability
to make a living?

415
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:45,431
Are you kidding?

416
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:48,758
I'm the top sales rep at Lauder
because of it.

417
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,639
I've cultivated this gregarious personality

418
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:55,639
so people would be more fascinated
with who I was

419
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:57,358
than what I look like.

420
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:02,553
It's just, you know...

421
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:08,078
You know how it is.
We feel such love for our children.

422
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:11,709
We just want everything
to be perfect, you know?

423
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:14,431
You know, nothing's ever that.

424
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:18,509
I think life is more about
embracing your imperfections.

425
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:21,439
I mean, how else
can you embrace anyone else's?

426
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:22,909
You're so right.

427
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:26,037
You know, you seem so much
more comfortable with yourself

428
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:27,712
than I am, and...

429
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:30,314
God, you must have had
very special parents.

430
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:32,953
The day I was born,

431
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,792
my father took one look at me

432
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:36,069
and bolted.

433
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:38,509
Wussy.

434
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:58,909
Great. Wasn't sure you'd be here.

435
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:03,955
My soap's out. Move over.

436
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:14,069
Yeah, you know, I can do this one myself.

437
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:20,150
It's your turn to take the afternoon off.
Why don't you go play some golf?

438
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:23,118
Golf?
When have you ever seen me play golf?

439
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:24,918
Exactly. You need to learn.

440
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,752
Name me one other successful doctor
you know

441
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:30,037
that is so hard at work,
he doesn't have time for 18 holes.

442
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:33,478
Well, I could name you two.

443
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:37,948
And the reason is because we keep
doubling up on all these surgeries.

444
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:41,715
If we wanna grow, we need to learn
how to work smarter, not harder.

445
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:44,394
But I thought you liked to work that way.
As a team.

446
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:48,155
That was always your idea.
I'm fine flying solo. Always have been.

447
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:54,157
I can't keep being your hobby, Sean.

448
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:01,476
Okay, which one of you ladies
has this man's balls?

449
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:04,678
I should have guessed.

450
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:06,910
- We ready to go?
- Meter's running.

451
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:08,435
Excellent.

452
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:10,079
We're not waiting for Sean?

453
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:12,594
Nope. It's a one-man show today, darling.

454
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:14,991
That why you need an audience?

455
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:26,479
Am I in trouble?

456
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:28,714
That depends.

457
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:30,671
What are you doing out here?

458
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:33,230
- I wanted to watch.
- Really?

459
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:36,431
Do you like to watch, Mrs. Landau?

460
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:39,159
When it comes to my husband,

461
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:42,152
I'd rather be in there
suturing the implants myself.

462
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:46,189
He's been to so many doctors this year.

463
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:47,918
They all spend five minutes in a room
with him

464
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,197
and suddenly they're qualified
to take his life into their hands

465
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:54,272
and I have to sit in the waiting room
biting my nails.

466
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:56,398
I can't do that again.

467
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:01,196
Even the guy who fixes my car
lets me look under the hood.

468
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:04,797
I understand your concern,
but we have a policy

469
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:07,872
that strictly forbids
clients watching me play doctor.

470
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:09,759
Just looking at you,

471
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:15,113
I find it hard to believe you've never
broken that rule before, Dr. Troy.

472
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:20,119
Everything okay?

473
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:25,349
That better?

474
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:27,673
What are you doing?

475
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:30,515
She's his wife.
She can't observe the surgery.

476
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:33,797
If anything goes wrong,
malpractice is not gonna cover us.

477
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:40,992
You know what's great
about having a pair of these, Liz?

478
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:44,429
You're not afraid to work without a net.

479
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:46,669
Fifteen-blade.

480
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:48,716
His scrotum's gonna swell
to the size of a grapefruit

481
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:50,597
over the next couple of weeks.

482
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:53,069
I recommend the only sexual contact
you have with your husband

483
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:56,072
is throwing him a bag of ice
or a bucket of Vicodin.

484
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:59,869
What about irrigating the scar
with some saline and Betadine swabs?

485
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:05,478
Burt made his money in the medical field.

486
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:07,039
It kind of rubs off.

487
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:12,998
I wanna thank you again.

488
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:15,829
It's refreshing

489
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:19,835
to see a doctor put his ego aside
and treat me with equal respect.

490
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:21,069
Well, if you really want to thank me,

491
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:24,357
why don't you come to my place
for dinner tonight?

492
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:27,471
Why go through all that trouble?

493
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:31,911
We should just hop
into the empty bed right here.

494
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:34,473
Before he wakes up.

495
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:40,633
I'm flattered.

496
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:45,152
But I've never cheated on my husband,
and I never will.

497
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:48,437
I'm sorry. After the very strong signals
you've been sending me, I thought...

498
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:50,511
I know what you thought.

499
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,433
You don't understand
how someone my age

500
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:53,714
can be attracted to an older man.

501
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:54,915
Certainly not without a pre-nup.

502
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,592
So you just assumed
I married him for his money?

503
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:57,749
Absolutely.

504
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:01,110
You don't choose who you love, Dr. Troy.

505
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:02,428
It chooses you.

506
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:09,674
I never saw myself
with an older man, either.

507
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:13,637
But when I stopped fighting
what my heart truly wanted,

508
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:15,950
I realized how happy I was with Burt.

509
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:17,875
Content.

510
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:24,072
Well, in that case,

511
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:27,314
I humbly withdraw
my indecent proposition.

512
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:31,752
What if I had a proposition for you,
Dr. Troy?

513
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:36,556
Buy us? We're not for sale.

514
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:38,433
We are at this price.

515
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:51,592
- Impressive, but I'm not impressed.
- Just read the proposal.

516
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:54,148
The up-front payment is
just for majority stake in the company.

517
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:56,879
We still get our salary,
we still own part of the business.

518
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:59,474
We just don't have to deal
with all the managerial bullshit, that's all.

519
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:01,312
- But why us?
- Who cares?

520
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:03,959
You heard the guy.

521
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:07,637
He eats paper planes
and shits out space shuttles.

522
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:10,518
It's gonna make us rich.

523
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:16,353
Look, we work 70 hours a week
just to keep pace, right?

524
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:20,752
This is gonna give us
at least 30 of those hours back.

525
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:23,875
They're not just buying our business,
they're helping keep us sane.

526
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:26,599
- But I am sane.
- Bullshit! You're a workaholic!

527
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:28,272
And you got another kid on the way.

528
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:30,351
I mean, you gonna let Julia raise
another one on her own?

529
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:32,112
You saw what a 70-hour work week
did to Matt.

530
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:34,555
Your genes are as responsible for that
as my work habits.

531
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:37,757
Are the Landaus gonna pay
to replace those? I'd be all for that!

532
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:38,955
Why are you doing this?

533
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:40,871
You've been acting
strange and distant all week,

534
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:43,076
and now you want to sell off
this thing we made together.

535
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:45,151
- What the hell's wrong with you?
- Nothing is wrong with me.

536
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:46,912
I just think we're still young men.

537
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,639
Why tie ourselves down
until we're not anymore?

538
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:52,515
This isn't a burden that I'm tied to.

539
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:54,109
It's our child.

540
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:58,113
Well, maybe it's time
to let your kiddie grow up.

541
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:03,954
Come on. This is what it's all about.

542
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:05,996
You build a business, you sell it off

543
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:09,277
and walk off into the sunset
with a buttload of cash.

544
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:13,511
Sorry, Christian,

545
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:16,558
but we need to both sign off on a sale,
and I won't do it.

546
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:18,599
I guess you're stuck with me.

547
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:41,670
Christian wants to sell the business

548
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,150
and have us work there as employees.

549
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:47,435
I don't know what's going on with him.

550
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:50,469
Asshole!

551
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:56,477
I'm his partner.
He's acting like he's just in this alone.

552
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:01,038
What? What's the matter?

553
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:04,079
It's about the baby.

554
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:07,874
- You lost it?
- No.

555
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:11,833
It's Christian's?

556
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:19,188
Dr. Allenby took another sonogram,

557
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:23,071
and we're having a baby boy.

558
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:27,675
A boy?

559
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:32,833
I'm having a son?

560
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:40,879
Something wrong?

561
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:45,071
Something wrong with our baby?

562
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:47,075
Yeah.

563
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:52,669
It's called Electridl...

564
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:56,678
I can't even pronounce it.

565
00:39:57,880 --> 00:39:59,154
Ectrodactyly?

566
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:09,156
How long have you known about this?

567
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:13,309
Well, I knew
that there was a possibility that...

568
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,831
Wait, you knew that...

569
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:19,190
You knew there was a possibility?

570
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:21,358
And you didn't tell me?

571
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:24,518
I thought things
were gonna be different, Julia.

572
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:25,749
I mean, one son was a lie.

573
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:28,308
I thought we were really gonna be
together this time.

574
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:31,312
I didn't know what "we" were.

575
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:34,433
I mean,
after everything we've been through,

576
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:36,238
I didn't know how we'd be.

577
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:43,549
But I've made a decision
that I'm having this baby no matter what.

578
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:46,589
Our baby.

579
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:50,598
And, you know, I'm sorry.
Maybe I should've told you

580
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:52,671
instead of pulling away.

581
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:53,795
I'm sorry.

582
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:58,598
You still couldn't trust me?

583
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:00,272
No, Sean, it wasn't that.

584
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:04,148
It was because I didn't know
how it would feel between us.

585
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:07,429
And I was scared that if I told you,

586
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,274
you wouldn't want it,

587
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:12,518
and that I might lose you.

588
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:22,994
You should've been honest with me, Julia.

589
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:26,393
Look, I can leave. You know, you're...

590
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:28,914
We're not married,
you're not bound to me.

591
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,116
I'm not gonna ask anything of you.

592
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:37,834
And I'm selling my shares from the spa

593
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:40,998
so that I can be with the baby full-time.

594
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:07,033
I'm so sorry.

595
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:23,993
It's our baby, Julia.

596
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:29,792
I wanna do this with you.

597
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:36,395
It's not going to be easy.
I don't know what we're gonna do.

598
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:50,152
We're gonna love each other.

599
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:12,396
- What are you doing?
- Just taking a little drive.

600
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:15,119
I was in the neighborhood,
thought I'd drop by,

601
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:17,233
see my partner.

602
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:33,638
Why is there
a statue of a cock in the corner?

603
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:40,357
It's not a cock, Sean.
It's called abstract art.

604
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:42,630
It's from the Brutalism movement.

605
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:54,036
Is it a couch or is it a crocodile?

606
00:43:55,560 --> 00:43:58,597
Why'd you change everything?
I liked it the way it was.

607
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:05,154
Are you drunk?

608
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:07,876
Have you ever tried protein powder?

609
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:10,878
I've been working out.

610
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:13,714
You've officially been replaced
as my hobby.

611
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:17,994
Anyway, the stuff tastes like ass,

612
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:21,591
so I juiced it up a bit
with a delightfully-flavored vodka.

613
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:26,392
- I'll get you a cup of coffee.
- Oh, screw Folgers.

614
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:28,072
Break out the champagne!

615
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:33,393
Let's celebrate the sale of our business.

616
00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:40,952
- Are you serious?
- Oh, you're right, Christian.

617
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:42,598
I am a goddamn workaholic.

618
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:45,592
It's gotta stop
before I give myself a heart attack.

619
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:47,910
Julia's all for selling, by the way.

620
00:44:50,360 --> 00:44:53,113
She wants to be a full-time mom
this time around.

621
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:56,599
Gina's agreed to buy out
her shares of the spa.

622
00:44:58,840 --> 00:44:59,829
Yeah.

623
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,389
That cash isn't rolling in anytime soon.

624
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:12,434
Handicapped children
need a lot of extra care,

625
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:14,793
not to mention money,

626
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:17,751
so it all works out perfectly.

627
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:24,269
My little boy's got ectrodactyly.

628
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:33,554
My little innocent unborn baby boy got hit
with a one-in-a-million bolt of lightning.

629
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:37,549
Jesus.

630
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:48,194
I'm so sorry.

631
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:50,518
I don't want your pity.

632
00:45:52,440 --> 00:45:55,512
You should be happy, after all.
You got the perfect son.

633
00:45:58,600 --> 00:46:01,239
I know you don't believe this now,
but in time,

634
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:05,591
things will all work out fine.

635
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:08,554
- He'll be able to live a normal life.
- No, he won't!

636
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:10,153
He'll never be normal!

637
00:46:10,320 --> 00:46:12,629
Look, you're a doctor.
You know what those hands look like.

638
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:15,996
He's never gonna be able to play ball
in the backyard with his old man.

639
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:17,308
Never be able to go out in public

640
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:21,473
and not be stared at by strangers
who whisper and laugh that he's a freak!

641
00:46:28,360 --> 00:46:29,918
Did you just find out?

642
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:34,195
She got the final diagnosis this week.

643
00:46:37,560 --> 00:46:40,597
And now she's six months along.
The ship has sailed.

644
00:46:46,600 --> 00:46:49,239
Would you have asked her
to have an abortion

645
00:46:50,280 --> 00:46:52,157
if you knew about it earlier?

646
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:55,195
Yes.

647
00:46:57,200 --> 00:46:58,838
God help me, yes.

648
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:04,389
Yep.

649
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:53,876
I'll see you Monday at the lawyer's office.

650
00:49:42,280 --> 00:49:43,872
Hi, I'm Cindy.

651
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:47,396
What can I do for you this evening?

652
00:50:09,880 --> 00:50:10,915
Hi.

653
00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:15,552
Want some company?

654
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:20,432
Not tonight, sweetheart. Thanks.

655
00:51:14,080 --> 00:51:15,513
English
