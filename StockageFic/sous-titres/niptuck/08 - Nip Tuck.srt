<i>Previously on Nip / Tuck:</i>

2
00:00:10,805 --> 00:00:14,764
I don't think I can let myself be vulnerable
with a man that I can't have.

3
00:00:14,842 --> 00:00:16,776
Who says you can't have me?

4
00:00:40,501 --> 00:00:41,900
This is out.

5
00:00:43,904 --> 00:00:47,169
Just because we're smoking your shit
doesn't make me your bitch.

6
00:00:47,241 --> 00:00:49,766
It's Shabbos. I'm not allowed to make fire.

7
00:00:51,078 --> 00:00:54,275
Make fire.
And what else, invent the wheel?

8
00:00:54,849 --> 00:00:58,307
There are rules of conduct
laid down centuries ago...

9
00:00:58,386 --> 00:01:00,877
by the wisest men in the Sanhedrin.

10
00:01:01,255 --> 00:01:04,884
Have a little respect
and light my bong, Shabbos goy.

11
00:01:05,559 --> 00:01:09,586
That's a Gentile who does the work
we're not allowed to do on Shabbos.

12
00:01:09,664 --> 00:01:12,531
Driving, carrying, cooking--

13
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,227
Can you have sex?

14
00:01:16,137 --> 00:01:18,935
Depends on how you interpret
''no plowing.''

15
00:01:22,843 --> 00:01:26,836
I don't get it. You think God's gonna be
pissed at you for lighting a match?

16
00:01:26,914 --> 00:01:29,644
God won't give a shit. But I will.

17
00:01:30,451 --> 00:01:33,147
Look, if I follow the rules...

18
00:01:34,021 --> 00:01:36,046
l'lI live a happy life...

19
00:01:36,557 --> 00:01:38,184
and l'lI survive.

20
00:01:38,793 --> 00:01:42,627
That's how come we've been around
for over 3,000 years.

21
00:01:43,831 --> 00:01:47,562
Because, for Jews,
what's most important is, you know...

22
00:01:54,475 --> 00:01:56,238
living righteously.

23
00:02:01,716 --> 00:02:04,048
Henry, your ride is smooth.

24
00:02:04,118 --> 00:02:06,882
I know. Hanukkah present from the folks.

25
00:02:08,989 --> 00:02:11,753
There's definitely benefits
to being a Shabbos goy.

26
00:02:11,859 --> 00:02:15,989
I'm glad you feeI that way,
because when we stop at the 7-Eleven...

27
00:02:16,597 --> 00:02:19,191
you get to work the Big Gulp machine.

28
00:02:25,039 --> 00:02:28,839
Man, I love this.
I'm so down with this mofo shit!

29
00:02:29,210 --> 00:02:32,145
Dude, you only like it
because you're stoned.

30
00:02:35,549 --> 00:02:36,777
You bitch.

31
00:02:51,665 --> 00:02:52,893
Come on.

32
00:03:28,202 --> 00:03:29,430
Nothing.

33
00:03:31,605 --> 00:03:33,470
I think we hit a bird.

34
00:03:34,475 --> 00:03:35,703
Let's go.

35
00:04:47,181 --> 00:04:50,207
Mom's making French toast
instead of nuking an Eggo.

36
00:04:50,284 --> 00:04:52,149
ls it somebody's birthday?

37
00:04:52,219 --> 00:04:54,119
I was feeling generous.

38
00:05:00,194 --> 00:05:02,628
-Want to color?
-Yeah, sure, honey.

39
00:05:05,132 --> 00:05:06,565
How horrible.

40
00:05:06,634 --> 00:05:09,603
Another war break out
while we were sleeping?

41
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:12,366
Some girI got run over
by a hit-and-run driver.

42
00:05:12,439 --> 00:05:14,669
Right near your school, Matt.

43
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,671
Really? What does it say?

44
00:05:22,483 --> 00:05:25,680
''The victim, Cara Fitzgerald,
a 16-year-old junior...

45
00:05:25,753 --> 00:05:28,984
''was found near death in a ditch
behind CoraI Gables High School...

46
00:05:29,056 --> 00:05:31,047
''by an unidentified homeless man.''

47
00:05:31,125 --> 00:05:34,652
Who could run someone over
and then leave the scene of the crime?

48
00:05:34,728 --> 00:05:36,457
Matt, French toast?

49
00:05:38,299 --> 00:05:40,096
Sure, yeah.

50
00:05:43,337 --> 00:05:46,636
Miss Greco, telI me what you don't like
about yourself.

51
00:05:46,707 --> 00:05:47,935
My nose.

52
00:05:49,643 --> 00:05:52,737
-Too big, too small?
-Too much like my father's.

53
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:56,340
Miss Greco, not to be presumptuous,
but it looks fine.

54
00:05:56,417 --> 00:05:59,250
More than fine, Dr. Santiago.
It's the gold standard.

55
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:01,550
AlI the big models
possess the aquiline slope:

56
00:06:01,622 --> 00:06:03,419
Linda Evangelista, Christy Turlington.

57
00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:07,358
Well, I'm guessing that
Christy Turlington's father didn't rape her.

58
00:06:10,331 --> 00:06:12,060
But don't feeI bad.

59
00:06:12,132 --> 00:06:14,293
When I said I didn't feeI like it...

60
00:06:14,368 --> 00:06:17,394
he'd give me money
so I could buy more Barbies.

61
00:06:17,471 --> 00:06:19,302
I thought that was love, you know.

62
00:06:19,373 --> 00:06:22,934
-Did you report your father, Miss Greco?
-When I was 14.

63
00:06:23,010 --> 00:06:26,173
My younger sister Janice
had the room next to mine.

64
00:06:26,246 --> 00:06:27,804
She was seven then.

65
00:06:27,881 --> 00:06:30,145
I heard him through the walls,
whispering to her.

66
00:06:30,217 --> 00:06:32,549
So I called the cops that night.

67
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,054
We went to foster care.

68
00:06:37,091 --> 00:06:39,924
Are you currently in counseling,
Miss Greco?

69
00:06:39,994 --> 00:06:41,962
Why does that matter to you?

70
00:06:42,529 --> 00:06:44,895
You seem very angry.

71
00:06:45,599 --> 00:06:48,762
You seem like
you haven't really dealt with this.

72
00:06:49,069 --> 00:06:53,165
I've spent 12 years on a shrink's couch.

73
00:06:53,841 --> 00:06:55,968
I'm sick of dealing with it.

74
00:06:56,043 --> 00:07:00,377
Every day when I look in the mirror,
I see that man staring back at me.

75
00:07:01,548 --> 00:07:03,812
I want him carved off my face.

76
00:07:07,054 --> 00:07:10,888
Miss Greco, l'd like to recommend
a colleague of mine, Dr. Martin Hargrove.

77
00:07:10,958 --> 00:07:13,756
Wait a minute.
You're blowing me off? Why?

78
00:07:13,827 --> 00:07:15,852
I think you have unrealistic expectations.

79
00:07:15,929 --> 00:07:18,159
After you change your nose,
then what, Miss Greco?

80
00:07:18,232 --> 00:07:20,097
WilI you move on to altering your jawline?

81
00:07:20,167 --> 00:07:24,297
Who the helI are you to telI me
in what way I should properly heal?

82
00:07:25,239 --> 00:07:28,208
How dare you judge me
when you have no idea what it's like...

83
00:07:28,275 --> 00:07:32,405
to have a dick you can't say no to
forced on you for years?

84
00:07:39,486 --> 00:07:42,216
Excuse me. I'm late for a surgery.

85
00:07:42,890 --> 00:07:45,825
Dr. Santiago wilI show you out,
Miss Greco.

86
00:07:52,332 --> 00:07:55,631
Good afternoon, Mr. Shane.
How are we healing today?

87
00:07:56,937 --> 00:08:00,771
Dr. Troy told me not to take
the bandage off, so I don't know.

88
00:08:01,875 --> 00:08:05,140
-Sorry, you are?
-Dr. McNamara, Dr. Troy's partner.

89
00:08:05,979 --> 00:08:09,471
l'd really like him to do the follow-up,
if you don't mind.

90
00:08:10,084 --> 00:08:13,315
This has been
kind of embarrassing for me.

91
00:08:13,387 --> 00:08:16,220
I'm sorry. He's in surgery
that went longer than expected.

92
00:08:16,290 --> 00:08:18,155
He asked me to step in.

93
00:08:20,127 --> 00:08:22,823
You had a birthmark removed, Mr. Shane?

94
00:08:23,263 --> 00:08:26,027
Ugly and purple
and shaped like an amoeba.

95
00:08:27,501 --> 00:08:30,265
lt was on my balI sac. My fiancée hated it.

96
00:08:30,871 --> 00:08:33,101
AlI right. Let's take a look.

97
00:08:48,722 --> 00:08:51,122
Sorry. Caught a pubic hair there.

98
00:08:58,766 --> 00:09:00,097
There's a pink mark.

99
00:09:00,167 --> 00:09:03,625
That's normal. The laser made a scab
which has fallen away already.

100
00:09:03,704 --> 00:09:05,672
That's a sign you're healing properly.

101
00:09:05,739 --> 00:09:07,604
The slight pigmentation that remains--

102
00:09:07,674 --> 00:09:09,642
I was told this would be healed
in two weeks.

103
00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:11,041
You have a deadline?

104
00:09:11,111 --> 00:09:14,080
The honeymoon. That's why I paid $5,000.

105
00:09:15,215 --> 00:09:17,683
Well, there's stilI a mark there.

106
00:09:19,686 --> 00:09:21,313
I want Dr. Troy.

107
00:09:25,325 --> 00:09:27,759
I don't mean to be a horse's ass, Dr. Troy...

108
00:09:27,828 --> 00:09:31,229
but, you know,
it has been a little traumatic for me.

109
00:09:31,298 --> 00:09:33,596
You're the only one I want
handling my penis.

110
00:09:33,667 --> 00:09:36,966
Mike, you're the only man
who's ever said that to me.

111
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:43,576
Very nice. Slight pinkness,
but that should fade in a matter of weeks.

112
00:09:43,644 --> 00:09:46,613
You made a promise.
Two weeks, you said it would be gone.

113
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:48,807
It's my honeymoon, remember?

114
00:09:48,882 --> 00:09:52,215
-She hates giving me head.
-And you're gonna marry the bitch?

115
00:09:52,286 --> 00:09:54,550
Yeah, just don't telI my girlfriend.

116
00:09:58,158 --> 00:09:59,250
What's that?

117
00:09:59,326 --> 00:10:01,556
Bleaching cream. Twice a day, for a week.

118
00:10:01,628 --> 00:10:04,597
lt ought to take care
of any redness that remains.

119
00:10:06,433 --> 00:10:09,197
So, by my honeymoon, no sign of the scar.

120
00:10:10,637 --> 00:10:12,366
Or your money back.

121
00:10:15,142 --> 00:10:16,734
''Fieldencrantz.

122
00:10:17,845 --> 00:10:19,142
''Fields.''

123
00:10:20,714 --> 00:10:23,615
Here she is. ''Fitzgerald, Cara.

124
00:10:24,451 --> 00:10:28,080
''Founding member
of the Christian Fellowship Prayer Club.''

125
00:10:29,756 --> 00:10:33,021
According to the paper,
there were no eyewitnesses.

126
00:10:34,061 --> 00:10:37,292
-God was a witness.
-I mean, who could identify us.

127
00:10:43,303 --> 00:10:46,932
We have to go to the hospital
and find out what she knows.

128
00:10:47,274 --> 00:10:49,674
Maybe you'd like to feel
the soybean oiI implant.

129
00:10:49,743 --> 00:10:51,335
It's lighter than the saline.

130
00:10:51,411 --> 00:10:54,869
That's exactly what I'm looking for,
something lighter.

131
00:10:56,483 --> 00:10:58,144
Now what do we do?

132
00:10:58,418 --> 00:11:00,409
I got a couple of ideas.

133
00:11:08,462 --> 00:11:11,693
-God, you smelI good.
-You're alI I think about.

134
00:11:11,765 --> 00:11:13,357
-Really?
-Really.

135
00:11:14,301 --> 00:11:15,825
I wanna get the implants.

136
00:11:15,903 --> 00:11:17,928
The door's closed.
We don't have to pretend.

137
00:11:18,005 --> 00:11:21,736
No, really.
I've decided I wanna get the implants.

138
00:11:40,661 --> 00:11:42,094
Who are you?

139
00:11:44,932 --> 00:11:46,194
I'm Matt.

140
00:11:47,067 --> 00:11:49,092
I'm Matt McNamara.

141
00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:52,061
I'm Cara's mother, Kate.

142
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:55,731
I don't know you, Matt. Does Cara?

143
00:11:58,679 --> 00:12:00,169
We're friends.

144
00:12:00,247 --> 00:12:02,579
How did you and Cara meet, Matt?

145
00:12:03,884 --> 00:12:05,784
I'm in the Prayer Club.

146
00:12:06,086 --> 00:12:07,314
Really?

147
00:12:08,822 --> 00:12:10,881
Cara founded that club.

148
00:12:10,958 --> 00:12:14,121
I thought she couldn't find
anybody else to join.

149
00:12:18,198 --> 00:12:19,563
Has she...

150
00:12:22,035 --> 00:12:23,297
woken up?

151
00:12:24,671 --> 00:12:26,605
Not since the accident.

152
00:12:27,407 --> 00:12:29,238
She's not responding.

153
00:12:29,476 --> 00:12:32,445
The doctors say, on a coma scale,
she's a six.

154
00:12:33,013 --> 00:12:37,177
I don't understand that,
but the doctors say it's almost a blessing.

155
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:39,445
She is breathing on her own...

156
00:12:41,021 --> 00:12:43,012
and she's not in any pain.

157
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:45,615
She's not on any medication?

158
00:12:45,993 --> 00:12:48,325
No, that's against our beliefs.

159
00:12:48,729 --> 00:12:50,788
We're Christian Scientists.

160
00:12:50,964 --> 00:12:53,660
Didn't Cara telI you that
at your Prayer Club meeting?

161
00:12:53,734 --> 00:12:54,792
Yes.

162
00:12:57,671 --> 00:13:00,105
So this would be what she'd want.

163
00:13:01,141 --> 00:13:04,076
Sometimes she struggles with her faith...

164
00:13:04,144 --> 00:13:06,271
as I did when I was her age.

165
00:13:07,647 --> 00:13:09,376
The acne, you know.

166
00:13:09,616 --> 00:13:13,211
She wanted to try the Proactiv,
but we couldn't do that.

167
00:13:13,286 --> 00:13:17,313
And I would telI her,
''Sweetheart, the light in you is so bright.

168
00:13:18,392 --> 00:13:21,919
''That light wilI one day
bring someone into your life...

169
00:13:22,529 --> 00:13:25,498
''that wilI like you for who you really are.''

170
00:13:28,301 --> 00:13:29,893
And in you walk.

171
00:13:31,338 --> 00:13:33,101
God bless you, Matt.

172
00:13:36,877 --> 00:13:38,777
How badly was she hurt?

173
00:13:41,448 --> 00:13:45,009
There are 14 bones in the human face.
Did you know that?

174
00:13:45,685 --> 00:13:48,745
According to the doctors, she broke 10.

175
00:13:49,089 --> 00:13:52,820
When they found her in the ditch,
her face was so swollen...

176
00:13:54,261 --> 00:13:56,957
that it didn't even look like a person.

177
00:14:01,034 --> 00:14:02,797
She wilI get better.

178
00:14:03,370 --> 00:14:04,701
I know it.

179
00:14:12,612 --> 00:14:14,477
WilI you pray with me?

180
00:14:25,892 --> 00:14:27,257
Dear Heavenly Father...

181
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:31,525
thank you for sending Cara's friend, Matt,
here today to rally her spirit.

182
00:14:31,598 --> 00:14:33,429
It's such a blessing.

183
00:14:34,101 --> 00:14:37,628
Please help Cara to heal
in the manner that you see fit.

184
00:14:41,908 --> 00:14:43,398
And, Father...

185
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:50,716
please help them find the monster
who did this to her.

186
00:15:03,130 --> 00:15:07,658
Mrs. O'Hara, after looking at your chart,
I have to say I'm a little confused.

187
00:15:07,734 --> 00:15:11,670
You decided not to have
breast reconstruction during your surgery.

188
00:15:11,738 --> 00:15:16,038
You then came in for a consultation
and again decided against implants.

189
00:15:16,109 --> 00:15:17,667
Now you suddenly want them.

190
00:15:17,744 --> 00:15:22,340
Has something in your life changed
recently that's led you to this decision?

191
00:15:23,617 --> 00:15:26,552
I agree that the implants aren't necessary.

192
00:15:27,187 --> 00:15:29,519
So you're against the surgery, then?

193
00:15:29,589 --> 00:15:32,683
No. It's Mrs. O'Hara's choice. It's her body.

194
00:15:32,759 --> 00:15:34,818
I think, and I've told her this...

195
00:15:34,895 --> 00:15:38,194
that she looks spectacular
with or without breasts.

196
00:15:41,034 --> 00:15:43,662
No one's ever said that to me before.

197
00:15:43,970 --> 00:15:45,835
Not even your husband?

198
00:15:47,941 --> 00:15:50,171
Jim wasn't very communicative.

199
00:15:50,877 --> 00:15:53,402
Unlike the person you're seeing now?

200
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:56,514
I didn't say I was seeing anyone.

201
00:15:56,583 --> 00:16:01,043
I'm sorry. I jumped to the new-partner-
new-set-of-pressures theory.

202
00:16:01,321 --> 00:16:05,280
For many women, breasts are
the root place of sexuaI confidence.

203
00:16:06,226 --> 00:16:08,854
That's right. I would agree with that.

204
00:16:14,467 --> 00:16:16,264
I am dating someone.

205
00:16:18,171 --> 00:16:20,162
No, it's more than that.

206
00:16:22,209 --> 00:16:24,040
I'm in love with him.

207
00:16:25,011 --> 00:16:28,139
It's the first time in years
I've felt this alive.

208
00:16:28,915 --> 00:16:31,440
And after the chemo and the pain...

209
00:16:32,219 --> 00:16:34,119
and the living death...

210
00:16:34,421 --> 00:16:38,289
I want to embrace these feelings
with every ounce of my being.

211
00:16:47,067 --> 00:16:50,161
I wanna make love to him
with the lights on...

212
00:16:50,971 --> 00:16:55,101
without worrying about racing to a lamp
because I'm self-conscious.

213
00:16:57,110 --> 00:17:00,375
I don't wanna edit one minute of my life.

214
00:17:01,748 --> 00:17:03,511
Don't do it for him.

215
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:08,884
No, I'm doing it for me, Sean.

216
00:17:14,194 --> 00:17:15,855
<i>He's having an affair with her.</i>

217
00:17:15,929 --> 00:17:18,830
-Why would you assume that?
-Because of their interaction.

218
00:17:18,898 --> 00:17:21,526
She admitted in the room
that she was in love with him.

219
00:17:21,601 --> 00:17:25,128
-Sean's not the cheating kind.
-That's not necessarily true.

220
00:17:25,205 --> 00:17:28,538
70°% of alI men cheat.
The statistics are astounding.

221
00:17:28,942 --> 00:17:30,239
No, I'm disturbed by this.

222
00:17:30,310 --> 00:17:32,710
A plastic surgeon
giving his mistress implants...

223
00:17:32,779 --> 00:17:35,339
so that she can be
more sexually uninhibited with him.

224
00:17:35,415 --> 00:17:37,679
Don't you find that unsettling?

225
00:17:37,751 --> 00:17:41,585
Wait a minute. Who am I talking with?
Of course you wouldn't.

226
00:17:41,655 --> 00:17:44,556
She's been through cancer,
now a separation.

227
00:17:44,858 --> 00:17:46,758
This patient seems so fragile to me.

228
00:17:46,826 --> 00:17:49,124
She's making a rash decision
for the wrong reasons.

229
00:17:49,195 --> 00:17:50,321
You want me to talk to him?

230
00:17:50,397 --> 00:17:54,265
No, if I make an accusation
that's unfounded, he could fire me.

231
00:17:54,467 --> 00:17:56,594
Maybe you could feeI it out.

232
00:17:57,070 --> 00:17:59,004
When he talks about Devon Greco...

233
00:17:59,072 --> 00:18:02,007
casually mention the implants,
and see if you sense anything.

234
00:18:02,075 --> 00:18:05,306
Killer. Back up. Why would Sean
talk to me about Devon Greco?

235
00:18:05,378 --> 00:18:07,278
I bounced her case over to Hargrove.

236
00:18:07,347 --> 00:18:09,338
She was very upset by your nonchalance.

237
00:18:09,416 --> 00:18:12,317
She asked if there was another doctor
here she could speak to.

238
00:18:12,385 --> 00:18:15,013
So I made an appointment
for Sean to see her on Friday.

239
00:18:15,088 --> 00:18:16,817
Look, I'm gonna head to lunch.

240
00:18:16,890 --> 00:18:19,324
Thanks for listening to me
about Megan O'Hara.

241
00:18:19,392 --> 00:18:22,953
But please don't telI him
we had this conversation.

242
00:18:23,763 --> 00:18:25,128
Of course not.

243
00:18:27,634 --> 00:18:31,126
How dare you telI my partner
that I'm having an affair with a patient?

244
00:18:31,204 --> 00:18:34,901
I can't believe I was so stupid
as to think I could trust you...

245
00:18:34,974 --> 00:18:38,068
with even a moment of vulnerability.
You're an asshole.

246
00:18:38,144 --> 00:18:40,908
And you're an arrogant Ph.D.
in a Prada knockoff skirt...

247
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:43,244
who shouldn't be spreading lies
about my partner.

248
00:18:43,316 --> 00:18:45,443
Or accusing me
of being rude to a consult...

249
00:18:45,518 --> 00:18:47,850
and then trying to bypass
my executive decisions.

250
00:18:47,921 --> 00:18:50,185
Who else did you unload on, Dr. Santiago?

251
00:18:50,256 --> 00:18:51,917
The nurses? The janitor?

252
00:18:51,991 --> 00:18:54,516
lf I discover
you weakened the morale of this office...

253
00:18:54,594 --> 00:18:55,993
with your unfounded gossip--

254
00:18:56,062 --> 00:19:00,294
What, Sean? You'lI fire me?
Are my accusations that unfounded?

255
00:19:00,367 --> 00:19:02,232
You mind your own goddamn business!

256
00:19:02,302 --> 00:19:04,793
This is my business!
This patient is my business.

257
00:19:04,871 --> 00:19:06,930
You have put me in a difficult situation...

258
00:19:07,006 --> 00:19:09,702
and this is not the first time
you've done it.

259
00:19:12,979 --> 00:19:14,742
Let's take a break.

260
00:19:14,981 --> 00:19:18,542
No, I am sick of the secrets,
some of which are mine.

261
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:21,750
Let's just put it alI on the table.

262
00:19:21,821 --> 00:19:23,812
I'm not having an affair.

263
00:19:24,157 --> 00:19:25,385
I believe you, Sean.

264
00:19:25,458 --> 00:19:28,723
I don't believe you because
I know your marriage is in trouble.

265
00:19:28,795 --> 00:19:32,788
You told me that right before your hand
crept up my thigh under the table.

266
00:19:35,402 --> 00:19:39,395
Fascinating late-breaking information
here at the people's court.

267
00:19:40,073 --> 00:19:41,472
When did this happen?

268
00:19:41,541 --> 00:19:43,270
The day before I hired her.

269
00:19:43,343 --> 00:19:46,574
And did you hire her
because you were afraid she'd sue?

270
00:19:46,646 --> 00:19:50,605
Lawsuits usually happen when people
are fired after they sleep with the boss.

271
00:19:50,683 --> 00:19:52,651
-ls that a threat?
-Wait.

272
00:19:53,052 --> 00:19:54,883
You slept with Grace?

273
00:19:57,390 --> 00:19:58,687
lt won't happen again.

274
00:19:58,758 --> 00:20:01,625
Goddamn it! Are you out of your mind?
How could you do this?

275
00:20:01,694 --> 00:20:03,992
Sleep with someone that rejected you?

276
00:20:04,931 --> 00:20:06,455
Leave! Go home.

277
00:20:14,073 --> 00:20:15,597
Just for today.

278
00:20:19,312 --> 00:20:20,904
I don't want her here, Sean.

279
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:23,244
She's a troublemaker,
and her shoes are cheap.

280
00:20:23,316 --> 00:20:26,251
Shut up, Christian.
Shut up and let me think.

281
00:20:27,287 --> 00:20:31,121
lf Julia even suspected for a second
I was having an affair, that would be it.

282
00:20:31,191 --> 00:20:33,921
She'd file for divorce,
she'd take the kids away from me.

283
00:20:33,993 --> 00:20:35,654
I can't risk that.

284
00:20:35,795 --> 00:20:38,525
That's why I would never have an affair.

285
00:20:42,836 --> 00:20:45,430
Give Megan O'Hara the implants, Sean.

286
00:20:45,505 --> 00:20:46,938
Schedule it.

287
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:51,576
I can't do that now
after Grace's ridiculous accusation.

288
00:20:51,644 --> 00:20:54,204
lt would look suspicious
if you didn't do the operation.

289
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:57,374
Grace is obviously deluded,
about you, about me.

290
00:20:57,951 --> 00:21:00,385
You have my wholehearted support.

291
00:21:02,489 --> 00:21:05,219
Excuse me. Your son is here to see you.

292
00:21:05,358 --> 00:21:07,986
You said you wanted to do
more pro bono work.

293
00:21:08,061 --> 00:21:11,963
What's going on with you?
I thought you didn't even know this girl?

294
00:21:12,031 --> 00:21:14,431
I know her. I don't know her well.

295
00:21:18,905 --> 00:21:21,135
I visited her in the hospital.

296
00:21:23,243 --> 00:21:25,871
That story you read really got to me.

297
00:21:27,881 --> 00:21:30,145
Somebody ruined her life, Dad.

298
00:21:32,719 --> 00:21:36,553
Her mother's a fanaticaI religious person
who doesn't believe in medicine.

299
00:21:36,623 --> 00:21:39,023
Matt, the line that divides
Church and State...

300
00:21:39,092 --> 00:21:41,583
sometimes also applies to
medicine and the patient.

301
00:21:41,661 --> 00:21:44,323
You and I might not agree
with her mother's beliefs--

302
00:21:44,397 --> 00:21:48,197
When the bandages come off,
she is gonna look like a monster.

303
00:21:52,105 --> 00:21:53,766
I can't help her.

304
00:21:54,908 --> 00:21:56,170
You can.

305
00:21:57,377 --> 00:21:58,571
Please.

306
00:22:01,814 --> 00:22:04,305
<i>The alligator was removed
from the swimming pool...</i>

307
00:22:04,384 --> 00:22:06,579
<i>and taken to a reptile habitat in Key West.</i>

308
00:22:06,653 --> 00:22:10,248
<i>ln other news, a Catholic priest
was cleared of criminaI charges today...</i>

309
00:22:10,323 --> 00:22:13,554
<i>after a physicaI exam

310
00:22:13,626 --> 00:22:18,086
<i>that he had sexually abused 10 boys
over the past 5 years.</i>

311
00:22:18,164 --> 00:22:21,327
<i>The priest, Fr. MichaeI Shannon
of the St. Augustine Parish...</i>

312
00:22:21,401 --> 00:22:25,201
<i>proved his innocence, authorities say,
when a genitaI examination...</i>

313
00:22:25,271 --> 00:22:27,705

00:22:32,912 --> 00:22:37,212
<i>Fr. Shannon spoke to reporters

317
00:22:37,283 --> 00:22:40,775
<i>I want to thank everyone who stood by me
through this terrible ordeal.</i>

318
00:22:41,921 --> 00:22:44,981
<i>I want my accusers to know
they are forgiven...</i>

319
00:22:45,191 --> 00:22:47,955
<i>not just by me, but by God.</i>

320
00:22:48,628 --> 00:22:51,188
<i>Now it's time for alI of us
to put this behind us...</i>

321
00:22:51,264 --> 00:22:54,028
<i>and to focus our attention
on the reaI victims.</i>

322
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:58,537
<i>Those who have been abused by

323
00:22:58,838 --> 00:23:01,432
<i>They are the most in need of healing.</i>

324
00:23:02,141 --> 00:23:03,472
<i>Thank you.</i>

325
00:23:29,402 --> 00:23:30,835
Marking pen.

326
00:23:44,050 --> 00:23:45,210
Raytec.

327
00:23:48,788 --> 00:23:50,016
Scalpel.

328
00:24:27,226 --> 00:24:30,024
This surgery usually takes two hours, max.

329
00:24:30,496 --> 00:24:32,862
She's been under for three hours.

330
00:24:33,266 --> 00:24:36,531
-We should close.
-Does the inframammary falI too low?

331
00:24:37,437 --> 00:24:40,406
It's too low.
I think it needs to be higher. Scalpel.

332
00:24:40,473 --> 00:24:43,374
-Why?
-I'm gonna do it over. It's not right.

333
00:24:50,783 --> 00:24:51,977
What's wrong?

334
00:24:53,419 --> 00:24:55,353
Are you sure it was him on the news?

335
00:24:55,421 --> 00:24:57,719
lt was him. lt was him, and he lied.

336
00:24:57,790 --> 00:25:00,122
Stop asking questions
and offer some solutions.

337
00:25:00,193 --> 00:25:03,253
We shaved incriminating evidence
off a child molester's penis...

338
00:25:03,329 --> 00:25:05,729
-and helped him get away with it.
-We didn't know!

339
00:25:05,798 --> 00:25:07,766
We didn't know!
We thought she was a manatee.

340
00:25:07,834 --> 00:25:10,769
We've acted wickedly.
We've turned away from your good laws.

341
00:25:10,837 --> 00:25:13,135
When a man commits any wrong
toward a fellowman...

342
00:25:13,206 --> 00:25:16,175
thus breaking with Adonai,
he shalI confess the wrong done.

343
00:25:16,242 --> 00:25:18,210
lt was a hit-and-run, Henry.

344
00:25:18,277 --> 00:25:20,108
You think they serve kosher food in jail?

345
00:25:20,179 --> 00:25:22,647
Jail? Why would we go to jail
if we turn ourselves in?

346
00:25:22,715 --> 00:25:25,240
We had marijuana in the car.
That's 10 years.

347
00:25:25,318 --> 00:25:28,549
-Nobody has to know about that.
-They'lI figure it out.

348
00:25:31,591 --> 00:25:33,320
We didn't kilI her.

349
00:25:33,826 --> 00:25:36,886
This could alI go away
if we just keep it cool.

350
00:25:37,663 --> 00:25:41,258
-We have to keep a cooI head here.
-You may be comfortable with secrets--

351
00:25:41,334 --> 00:25:42,733
What's that supposed to mean?

352
00:25:42,802 --> 00:25:44,895
I'm not! We have to telI someone
what we did.

353
00:25:44,971 --> 00:25:47,439
Are you forgetting patient confidentiality?

354
00:25:47,507 --> 00:25:50,499
Bullshit! lf a person is a threat
to themselves or others...

355
00:25:50,576 --> 00:25:52,476
the point is moot. We're turning him in.

356
00:25:52,545 --> 00:25:54,513
I don't care about jail. I'm turning us in.

357
00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:56,980
No, you are not, Henry. Be smart.

358
00:25:57,116 --> 00:26:00,347
Be smart, Christian. Word leaks
to the media that we turned him in--

359
00:26:00,419 --> 00:26:03,877
-Are you defending this monster?
-I'm defending my family.

360
00:26:04,090 --> 00:26:06,957
Word travels fast in our luxurious circle.
You know that.

361
00:26:07,026 --> 00:26:09,586
People see that
we breached ethicaI agreements...

362
00:26:09,662 --> 00:26:13,154
and suddenly customers don't trust us,
and we go out of business.

363
00:26:13,232 --> 00:26:16,133
I've a family to support,
two children to put through college.

364
00:26:16,235 --> 00:26:18,260
What about college, Henry?

365
00:26:18,337 --> 00:26:22,068
lf a police record denies you medical
school, wilI the world be better off?

366
00:26:22,141 --> 00:26:23,506
We're not going to the police.

367
00:26:23,576 --> 00:26:26,306
-We're going to the police.
-And we'lI be called to trial.

368
00:26:26,379 --> 00:26:28,244
The Church, with its bottomless pockets...

369
00:26:28,314 --> 00:26:30,214
wilI investigate every mistake
we ever made.

370
00:26:30,283 --> 00:26:32,877
You think Liz wilI be quiet
in a room fulI of lawyers?

371
00:26:32,952 --> 00:26:35,819
She'lI lead them to the Everglades,
and off to prison we go.

372
00:26:35,888 --> 00:26:37,378
He raped boys!

373
00:26:46,966 --> 00:26:48,934
We have to do something.

374
00:26:49,001 --> 00:26:52,835
lsn't your dad gonna work on her face?
lsn't he gonna help us?

375
00:26:53,539 --> 00:26:57,066
We'lI calI the diocese
and telI them what we did, anonymously.

376
00:26:58,578 --> 00:27:02,036
And they'lI kick him out
and report what he did to the police.

377
00:27:02,114 --> 00:27:05,208
And it's their problem. We'lI be okay.

378
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:10,152
My dad's visiting her tomorrow.

379
00:27:15,394 --> 00:27:17,123
We're gonna be okay.

380
00:27:46,993 --> 00:27:48,392
Hello, Matt.

381
00:27:49,195 --> 00:27:50,355
Hello.

382
00:27:51,664 --> 00:27:53,996
Mrs. Fitzgerald, this is my dad.

383
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:56,190
He's a doctor.

384
00:27:56,502 --> 00:27:58,993
-Hello, Dr. McNamara.
-Sean.

385
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:04,901
Matt tells me
you're declining surgery for your daughter.

386
00:28:04,977 --> 00:28:07,878
I've hired a practitioner. One of the best.

387
00:28:08,314 --> 00:28:11,943
The environment at home
is much more conducive to healing.

388
00:28:12,251 --> 00:28:14,481
We'lI be moving her tomorrow.

389
00:28:14,987 --> 00:28:18,150
Mrs. Fitzgerald,
your daughter was in a serious accident.

390
00:28:18,224 --> 00:28:21,853
Without plastic surgery,
she'lI be permanently disfigured.

391
00:28:22,561 --> 00:28:24,791
False evidence appearing real.

392
00:28:24,864 --> 00:28:27,628
Mrs. Fitzgerald, you can't do this to her.

393
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:31,602
Cara wanted to fit in. You said so yourself.
Now, you know how cruel--

394
00:28:33,105 --> 00:28:37,633
<i>Dr. McNamara,
I respect your belief in materia medica.</i>

395
00:28:37,977 --> 00:28:40,775
Please respect my right as a parent...

396
00:28:40,846 --> 00:28:43,542
to determine
my daughter's course of treatment.

397
00:28:59,732 --> 00:29:01,222
Put that down.

398
00:29:04,470 --> 00:29:06,267
Dr. McNamara, please.

399
00:29:06,539 --> 00:29:08,700
Mrs. Fitzgerald, the x-rays indicate...

400
00:29:08,774 --> 00:29:10,901
that your daughter
suffered severaI fractures...

401
00:29:10,977 --> 00:29:13,468
which are encroaching on the optic nerve.

402
00:29:13,746 --> 00:29:15,839
We're praying to heaI that.

403
00:29:20,653 --> 00:29:23,850
Would you like to see
if your prayers are working?

404
00:29:36,569 --> 00:29:39,367
Matt, why don't you wait for me
in the cafeteria?

405
00:29:39,438 --> 00:29:42,601
No, l'd like to stay and support Cara.

406
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:30,511
Mrs. Fitzgerald, I'm very concerned.

407
00:30:39,031 --> 00:30:42,797
The cheekbone compression has stopped
blood supply to the optic nerve.

408
00:30:42,868 --> 00:30:46,599
-lf we don't correct this with surgery--
-No. We'lI pray harder.

409
00:30:46,672 --> 00:30:48,833
As much as I support
your right to do that...

410
00:30:48,908 --> 00:30:51,706
prayers won't stop your daughter
from going blind.

411
00:30:51,777 --> 00:30:53,369
She's gonna lose her sight?

412
00:30:53,446 --> 00:30:56,506
ln less than 48 hours,
if the blockage isn't repaired.

413
00:30:56,582 --> 00:31:01,019
You have to let me, or my equivalent
at this hospital, operate on your daughter.

414
00:31:01,087 --> 00:31:03,885
No, this is an illusion. Please leave.

415
00:31:03,956 --> 00:31:06,424
lf you don't agree to let me operate
on your daughter--

416
00:31:06,492 --> 00:31:08,858
You'lI what? Report me, Dr. McNamara?
To whom?

417
00:31:08,928 --> 00:31:11,692
l'lI have no choice
but to submit an immediate petition...

418
00:31:11,764 --> 00:31:13,527
and take medicaI custody of Cara.

419
00:31:13,599 --> 00:31:15,260
You won't do that.

420
00:31:16,635 --> 00:31:18,262
I love my daughter.

421
00:31:18,804 --> 00:31:20,431
You can see that.

422
00:31:20,706 --> 00:31:22,367
You won't do that.

423
00:31:37,223 --> 00:31:39,214
So since we have medicaI custody...

424
00:31:39,291 --> 00:31:41,987
does that mean
we have to pay for her college?

425
00:31:42,728 --> 00:31:45,526
Seriously, what happens
after we patch this pumpkin?

426
00:31:45,598 --> 00:31:49,762
We're now legally bound to supervise
the operation and her recuperation.

427
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:57,838
You think it's a good idea
to let him watch this?

428
00:31:58,010 --> 00:31:59,204
lf I were a mechanic...

429
00:31:59,278 --> 00:32:02,247
my son would wanna look under the hood
with me once in a while.

430
00:32:02,314 --> 00:32:04,145
I gave him the option. He was insistent.

431
00:32:04,216 --> 00:32:06,650
I don't recalI Matty ever talking
about this girl.

432
00:32:06,719 --> 00:32:08,744
Me, neither. But I'm proud of him.

433
00:32:08,821 --> 00:32:10,721
He's been so compassionate about her.

434
00:32:10,789 --> 00:32:14,418
lf he didn't get involved when he did,
she would have gone blind.

435
00:32:19,265 --> 00:32:21,392
Did you calI them, the diocese?

436
00:32:21,467 --> 00:32:24,459
-Got a machine.
-Did you leave a message though?

437
00:32:24,537 --> 00:32:27,768
We're doing this anonymously,
Christian, remember?

438
00:32:28,574 --> 00:32:33,034
lt is so shocking to me, parents' disregard
for their children's well-being.

439
00:32:33,112 --> 00:32:35,512
Her mother, Devon Greco's father.

440
00:32:38,617 --> 00:32:41,552
By the way, how was that appointment?

441
00:32:42,721 --> 00:32:44,746
Devon Greco? She canceled.

442
00:32:52,131 --> 00:32:53,564
May I help?

443
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:58,959
I saw on your patient form
that you owned your own flower store.

444
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:02,298
$45.

445
00:33:09,181 --> 00:33:10,671
Wrap for you?

446
00:33:13,252 --> 00:33:17,018
-Trying to get in some girl's pants?
-Trying to say I'm sorry.

447
00:33:21,293 --> 00:33:22,658
I'm sorry.

448
00:33:26,799 --> 00:33:29,029
You should put those in water.

449
00:33:35,341 --> 00:33:38,003
Look, I didn't mean to be rude to you.

450
00:33:40,145 --> 00:33:41,703
Well, you were.

451
00:33:46,318 --> 00:33:49,310
Hey, I just sent you flowers.
Give me a break.

452
00:33:51,190 --> 00:33:53,055
And l'lI give you one.

453
00:33:53,125 --> 00:33:55,150
You'lI give me a nose job?

454
00:34:02,568 --> 00:34:04,365
I saw him, you know.

455
00:34:05,704 --> 00:34:07,035
My father.

456
00:34:09,708 --> 00:34:11,198
Accidentally?

457
00:34:12,044 --> 00:34:13,375
Purposely.

458
00:34:15,748 --> 00:34:18,308
You were an asshole, but you were right.

459
00:34:18,384 --> 00:34:22,184
When you wouldn't give me the operation,
I realized, when was it gonna be over?

460
00:34:22,254 --> 00:34:25,883
I have his hands, too,
and one toe on my left foot.

461
00:34:25,958 --> 00:34:29,621
I realized, what was I gonna do,
make over my entire body?

462
00:34:29,695 --> 00:34:32,289
lf I did that, he'd stilI be winning.

463
00:34:33,666 --> 00:34:35,827
lt was never gonna be over...

464
00:34:36,035 --> 00:34:38,162
untiI I made it be over.

465
00:34:39,571 --> 00:34:41,334
So I looked him up.

466
00:34:45,411 --> 00:34:47,538
Did you get what you needed?

467
00:34:51,450 --> 00:34:53,748
That only happens in TV movies.

468
00:34:57,356 --> 00:34:59,256
He just kept crying...

469
00:34:59,558 --> 00:35:02,652
in his crappy studio apartment...

470
00:35:04,296 --> 00:35:06,264
and saying he was sorry.

471
00:35:07,399 --> 00:35:08,832
He was sick.

472
00:35:10,836 --> 00:35:12,770
He couldn't controI it.

473
00:35:16,608 --> 00:35:18,599
I thought I would cry...

474
00:35:19,478 --> 00:35:21,241
and rage...

475
00:35:22,781 --> 00:35:24,510
and get it alI out.

476
00:35:30,923 --> 00:35:32,618
But I did nothing.

477
00:35:37,930 --> 00:35:39,830
I felt nothing.

478
00:35:49,808 --> 00:35:53,710
What would you have done
if he was dead and you never...

479
00:35:55,347 --> 00:35:57,110
got to confront him?

480
00:35:59,752 --> 00:36:01,276
Why do you ask?

481
00:36:04,757 --> 00:36:08,853
It's good that you got to deaI with him
and what he did before he died.

482
00:36:15,167 --> 00:36:17,362
Won the battle, lost the war.

483
00:36:18,237 --> 00:36:19,829
Even when he dies...

484
00:36:19,905 --> 00:36:23,807
there'lI be a dozen other bastards
rising up to take his place.

485
00:36:24,910 --> 00:36:26,810
And just like him...

486
00:36:27,746 --> 00:36:29,737
they'lI get away with it.

487
00:36:38,157 --> 00:36:40,216
Thank you very much for coming.

488
00:36:40,292 --> 00:36:42,385
You had good time? You did good today.

489
00:36:42,461 --> 00:36:45,055
You did very well. I was very proud of you.

490
00:36:47,166 --> 00:36:48,895
And next week, you'lI be back?

491
00:36:48,967 --> 00:36:52,027
You'lI altar boy next week?
AlI right, that'lI be fun.

492
00:37:15,194 --> 00:37:16,821
How do you feel?

493
00:37:17,162 --> 00:37:18,527
Hung over.

494
00:37:20,199 --> 00:37:22,633
Nervous. Glad I did it.

495
00:37:24,903 --> 00:37:26,871
How do they look, doctor?

496
00:37:28,006 --> 00:37:29,701
It's my best work.

497
00:37:40,085 --> 00:37:42,144
So, I read this article...

498
00:37:44,690 --> 00:37:48,217
that said people in a coma
can hear everything you say...

499
00:37:50,496 --> 00:37:54,296
even though they probably won't
remember anything when they wake up.

500
00:38:07,279 --> 00:38:10,373
I'm sorry I never noticed you before
at school.

501
00:38:16,054 --> 00:38:18,420
And I'm sorry you felt so alone.

502
00:38:32,838 --> 00:38:34,829
I did this to you, Cara.

503
00:38:38,744 --> 00:38:40,075
lt was me.

504
00:38:46,318 --> 00:38:47,945
And I'm so sorry.

505
00:39:07,039 --> 00:39:09,530
Dr. McNamara, Dr. Troy on Line 2.

506
00:39:11,777 --> 00:39:12,937
Where are you?

507
00:39:13,545 --> 00:39:16,036
The gym. I needed to clear my head.

508
00:39:16,949 --> 00:39:18,541
Did you hear back from the diocese?

509
00:39:18,617 --> 00:39:21,882
Not yet. Look, if I can't get someone
on the phone by 5:00...

510
00:39:21,954 --> 00:39:23,421
we'lI come up with another plan.

511
00:39:23,555 --> 00:39:26,285
Don't worry, Sean. l'lI take care of it.

512
00:39:49,481 --> 00:39:51,039
Good afternoon.

513
00:39:53,251 --> 00:39:54,741
You may begin.

514
00:39:55,253 --> 00:39:57,847
Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned.

515
00:39:59,057 --> 00:40:01,958
It's been 22 years
since my last confession.

516
00:40:03,161 --> 00:40:04,822
These are my sins.

517
00:40:04,896 --> 00:40:06,557
Twenty-two years?

518
00:40:07,532 --> 00:40:09,159
That's a long time.

519
00:40:09,234 --> 00:40:11,327
I've lost my faith, Father.

520
00:40:12,904 --> 00:40:14,303
I've drank.

521
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:16,632
I've done drugs.

522
00:40:17,643 --> 00:40:21,204
I've fornicated with women
and discarded them like trash.

523
00:40:23,115 --> 00:40:24,844
I've lost my soul.

524
00:40:28,687 --> 00:40:30,484
The boys you raped...

525
00:40:31,289 --> 00:40:34,122
wilI be saying the same thing in 20 years.

526
00:40:35,794 --> 00:40:37,455
Did you know that?

527
00:40:44,202 --> 00:40:47,171
I know that
as a parent of one of my accusers...

528
00:40:47,239 --> 00:40:50,800
it's hard to look at your own child
and accept he's lied.

529
00:40:51,777 --> 00:40:53,404
Children make up stories.

530
00:40:53,478 --> 00:40:55,139
I'm not a parent.

531
00:40:57,249 --> 00:40:59,683
I'm your plastic surgeon, Michael.

532
00:41:01,186 --> 00:41:02,619
Remember me?

533
00:41:11,630 --> 00:41:13,097
I've stopped.

534
00:41:13,465 --> 00:41:15,660
I was sick, and I've stopped.

535
00:41:16,034 --> 00:41:18,025
I haven't touched anyone in two years.

536
00:41:18,103 --> 00:41:20,298
ls this a confession, Father?

537
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:24,167
I've repented in my own way.

538
00:41:27,412 --> 00:41:29,539
God doesn't judge. Why do you?

539
00:41:29,614 --> 00:41:33,106
Are you ready
to make a confession, Father?

540
00:41:35,053 --> 00:41:37,851
I have to live with it. I've done better.

541
00:41:42,494 --> 00:41:44,189
When does it stop?

542
00:41:44,596 --> 00:41:47,429
Are you ready
to make a confession, Father?

543
00:42:03,115 --> 00:42:04,878
Make your confession.

544
00:42:04,950 --> 00:42:07,145
CalI the police and make your confession...

545
00:42:07,219 --> 00:42:09,187
or I wilI leave you here to bleed out.

546
00:42:09,254 --> 00:42:11,586
I know just which artery to cut.

547
00:42:12,090 --> 00:42:13,352
I can't.

548
00:42:14,192 --> 00:42:15,523
I'm afraid.

549
00:42:16,194 --> 00:42:18,128
lf I go to prison, they'lI kilI me.

550
00:42:18,196 --> 00:42:20,289
Did you really think
you'd get away with it?

551
00:42:20,365 --> 00:42:21,764
There was no other way.

552
00:42:21,833 --> 00:42:25,564
After all, aren't you in the business of lies?

553
00:42:31,042 --> 00:42:32,475
I want to stop.

554
00:42:33,411 --> 00:42:34,537
I do.

555
00:42:36,748 --> 00:42:38,613
But when I see the boys...

556
00:42:40,485 --> 00:42:41,975
I feeI things.

557
00:42:46,625 --> 00:42:48,889
Oh, God!

558
00:42:51,830 --> 00:42:53,195
Forgive me.

559
00:42:57,202 --> 00:42:58,635
I want them.

560
00:43:04,042 --> 00:43:05,669
I have pictures.

561
00:43:06,912 --> 00:43:10,075
You want redemption, turn yourself in.

562
00:43:11,049 --> 00:43:13,449
Either way, you're going to jail.

563
00:43:13,985 --> 00:43:16,545
Whether you go to HelI is up to you.

564
00:43:38,944 --> 00:43:40,275
AlI right.

565
00:44:16,715 --> 00:44:20,412
Christian, what have you done?
What are you doing here?

566
00:44:25,123 --> 00:44:28,217
-I can't do it, Sean.
-You can't do what?

567
00:44:29,794 --> 00:44:31,557
I've been praying...

568
00:44:33,031 --> 00:44:35,295
to forgive, but I can't do it.

569
00:44:38,904 --> 00:44:41,600
The authorities wilI deaI with him now.

570
00:44:41,673 --> 00:44:42,935
Not him.

571
00:44:46,077 --> 00:44:47,135
Me.

572
00:44:55,220 --> 00:44:56,847
What did you do?

573
00:45:04,362 --> 00:45:06,125
I let him touch me.

574
00:45:07,299 --> 00:45:09,529
For years, I let him touch me.

575
00:45:12,237 --> 00:45:13,295
Who?

576
00:45:14,773 --> 00:45:16,070
Mr. Troy.

577
00:45:17,509 --> 00:45:19,272
Your foster father?

578
00:45:19,811 --> 00:45:23,474
He's dead and I thought that would end it.
But it didn't.

579
00:45:28,486 --> 00:45:30,784
Christian, you were just a boy.

580
00:45:33,925 --> 00:45:35,654
lf he abused you...

581
00:45:37,262 --> 00:45:38,889
it was his fault.

582
00:45:40,365 --> 00:45:42,026
He had the power.

583
00:45:45,003 --> 00:45:46,493
He's the one.

584
00:45:49,441 --> 00:45:52,308
I didn't have anything when he took me in.

585
00:45:54,346 --> 00:45:56,576
I wanted to be somebody.

586
00:46:03,755 --> 00:46:05,950
He said he'd give me money...

587
00:46:06,791 --> 00:46:08,656
if I let him touch me.

588
00:46:10,195 --> 00:46:11,560
And I did.

589
00:46:15,633 --> 00:46:17,225
I bought things.

590
00:46:20,839 --> 00:46:22,329
I sold myself.

591
00:46:26,044 --> 00:46:27,272
Oh, God.

592
00:46:28,213 --> 00:46:29,908
I sold myself.

593
00:46:33,818 --> 00:46:35,080
Oh, God.

594
00:47:13,725 --> 00:47:14,714
