1
00:00:00,008 --> 00:00:01,388
Previously on Nip/Tuck...

2
00:00:02,736 --> 00:00:03,996
I wanted to formally accept.

3
00:00:04,077 --> 00:00:05,817
I'm sorry. Accept what?

4
00:00:05,864 --> 00:00:08,163
Partnership in McNamara/Troy.

5
00:00:08,306 --> 00:00:09,341
Hire Quentin.

6
00:00:10,329 --> 00:00:12,965
Let's go away and start a new life together.

7
00:00:13,418 --> 00:00:14,838
Let's go to Paris.

8
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:16,381
Ava's a man.

9
00:00:18,408 --> 00:00:20,937
I needed to be sure you'd never leave me again.

10
00:00:21,496 --> 00:00:24,311
No. No.

11
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:37,951
Dr. Forsythe, tell us what you don't like about yourself.

12
00:00:38,285 --> 00:00:39,251
Why?

13
00:00:40,977 --> 00:00:43,385
So we can better understand how to help you.

14
00:00:43,425 --> 00:00:47,362
Kiki is the one who needs help, not me. I'm merely her advocate.

15
00:00:47,623 --> 00:00:52,498
I'm sorry. There's really no point in having a consultation without the patient present.

16
00:00:52,534 --> 00:00:53,716
She's a gorilla.

17
00:00:53,808 --> 00:00:56,629
I'm sure you're exaggerating.

18
00:00:56,794 --> 00:00:58,447
We've seen all sorts of serious...

19
00:00:58,534 --> 00:01:00,454
A mountain gorilla.

20
00:01:00,668 --> 00:01:04,555
I am Dr. Meredith Forsythe from the Gorilla Protection Agency.

21
00:01:06,514 --> 00:01:08,442
- This is a joke, right?
- I thought you knew.

22
00:01:08,504 --> 00:01:12,998
I sent information about my work and your nurse made an appointment for me.

23
00:01:13,081 --> 00:01:15,629
For you, yes. Not for some monkey.

24
00:01:15,713 --> 00:01:17,164
Ape. There's a difference.

25
00:01:17,259 --> 00:01:20,452
We share 98.4% of our D.N.A. with these creatures.

26
00:01:20,524 --> 00:01:23,766
I'm afraid there's been a terrible misunderstanding, Dr. Forsythe.

27
00:01:23,965 --> 00:01:25,588
We don't do animals.

28
00:01:25,728 --> 00:01:27,708
Kiki is not looking to be done.

29
00:01:28,102 --> 00:01:29,683
She wants to have a baby.

30
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:31,619
She told you that?

31
00:01:32,004 --> 00:01:35,931
Kiki can sign over 1,000 words and understands spoken english.

32
00:01:35,992 --> 00:01:40,063
She's already chosen a mate, Koomba, through video dating,

33
00:01:40,135 --> 00:01:43,099
but she can't meet him until the scar on her face is fixed.

34
00:01:45,581 --> 00:01:48,901
Are you saying that Kiki has a self-image problem?

35
00:01:48,981 --> 00:01:52,801
Apes are the only other creatures besides humans who can recognize themselves in the mirror.

36
00:01:52,858 --> 00:01:55,827
She knows she's different, imperfect in some way.

37
00:01:56,365 --> 00:01:58,429
She could use some lip gloss.

38
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:02,018
I'm sorry, Dr. Forsythe, but I have a hard time believing

39
00:02:02,069 --> 00:02:04,608
that self-loathing has extended to the animal kingdom.

40
00:02:04,674 --> 00:02:06,943
It's more a question of natural selection,

41
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:10,532
which, first and foremost, involves the selection of a mate.

42
00:02:10,643 --> 00:02:13,773
Any sort of deformity in an animal becomes undesirable,

43
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:17,208
a misfit, relegated to the outer edges of the herd.

44
00:02:17,536 --> 00:02:19,775
And so, she decided on plastic surgery?

45
00:02:19,850 --> 00:02:24,540
I am gravely concerned that when Koomba sees her scar, he will attack her,

46
00:02:24,612 --> 00:02:26,599
or more realistically, kill her.

47
00:02:28,047 --> 00:02:30,552
I'm appealing to you as scientists.

48
00:02:30,924 --> 00:02:34,877
At least look at some of my research before you decide.

49
00:02:37,653 --> 00:02:40,346
I began working with her when she was a baby.

50
00:02:41,378 --> 00:02:45,855
She'd been rescued after her mother was butchered by poachers.

51
00:02:46,342 --> 00:02:49,259
They cut off her mother's hands and head.

52
00:02:50,124 --> 00:02:55,445
It's illegal, but they still sold on the black market. It's a popular aphrodisiac.

53
00:02:56,859 --> 00:03:02,813
Kiki escaped with just a gash from the left side of her sagittal crest to her lips.

54
00:03:02,941 --> 00:03:06,084
What began as a 4-year study of primates and language

55
00:03:06,116 --> 00:03:09,765
turned into a lifelong study of interspecies communication.

56
00:03:11,184 --> 00:03:14,815
It is imperative that Kiki procreate in order to determine

57
00:03:14,881 --> 00:03:18,451
if she can pass on her language skills to her offspring.

58
00:03:18,618 --> 00:03:23,406
Otherwise, all the work we've done will disappear with her when she dies.

59
00:03:23,579 --> 00:03:28,817
Look, maybe Koomba can see past Kiki's scar to her inner beauty.

60
00:03:28,883 --> 00:03:31,131
Maybe he's not a shallow bastard like the rest of us.

61
00:03:31,209 --> 00:03:32,796
Don't be so hard on yourself.

62
00:03:32,882 --> 00:03:35,355
Beauty attracts to preserve the species.

63
00:03:35,427 --> 00:03:39,406
In evolutionary terms, Dr. Troy, all males are bastards.

64
00:04:39,689 --> 00:04:42,132
Oh, I missed having you inside me.

65
00:04:48,982 --> 00:04:50,993
I thought I could forget about you.

66
00:04:51,410 --> 00:04:53,514
You'd be better off without me.

67
00:04:55,429 --> 00:04:57,184
You're all I think about.

68
00:04:58,347 --> 00:05:00,011
No one else matters.

69
00:05:03,246 --> 00:05:04,628
The ticket's still good.

70
00:05:05,376 --> 00:05:07,465
Take it. It's back at the house.

71
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:18,886
Ohh! Cum with me, Matt. Ohh!

72
00:05:19,518 --> 00:05:23,953
Ohh! Please, cum with me. Ohh!

73
00:06:55,689 --> 00:06:58,800
A man washing a dish in this office?

74
00:06:58,914 --> 00:07:00,389
I must be dreaming.

75
00:07:01,531 --> 00:07:04,469
Elizabeth Cruz, Quentin Costa.

76
00:07:05,181 --> 00:07:07,684
They speak very highly of you at shands medical.

77
00:07:07,802 --> 00:07:08,801
They do?

78
00:07:08,949 --> 00:07:09,854
Oh, yeah.

79
00:07:09,975 --> 00:07:14,268
A distinguished residency, then you did a fellowship in pain management--

80
00:07:14,392 --> 00:07:16,644
Did you go gold rate or what?

81
00:07:16,756 --> 00:07:19,394
An attractive woman like you must go gold all the time.

82
00:07:19,685 --> 00:07:23,366
Save it for someone whose panties you may have a chance in hell of getting into.

83
00:07:23,449 --> 00:07:24,452
Liz is gay.

84
00:07:25,051 --> 00:07:27,829
Welcome to McNamara/Troy.

85
00:07:27,945 --> 00:07:28,867
I'm honored.

86
00:07:30,530 --> 00:07:33,978
You know, I've been reading up on your cases and it's cutting edge stuff.

87
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:36,132
- You guys are fearless.
- Ha!

88
00:07:37,232 --> 00:07:41,247
Apparently, Liz thinks I'm a pussy because I refuse to do a scar revision on an ape.

89
00:07:41,318 --> 00:07:44,575
A gorilla who can sign over 1,000 words.

90
00:07:45,021 --> 00:07:48,107
Christian, that tattoo removal consult's in my office.

91
00:07:48,696 --> 00:07:50,994
Hey, Quentin. How's your first morning going?

92
00:07:51,128 --> 00:07:52,669
Feels like home. Thank you.

93
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,729
You know, Sean, speaking of tattoos,

94
00:07:56,995 --> 00:08:00,288
I can get us a new med-life at cost, 79,000.

95
00:08:00,366 --> 00:08:01,204
It's state of the art.

96
00:08:01,216 --> 00:08:02,653
- The q-switch laser?
- Yeah.

97
00:08:02,665 --> 00:08:03,661
Been wanting to see how it works.

98
00:08:03,679 --> 00:08:05,490
Look, but don't touch. We can't afford it.

99
00:08:05,523 --> 00:08:08,567
Maybe the publicity from working on a world-famous gorilla...

100
00:08:08,578 --> 00:08:09,888
Drop it, Liz.

101
00:08:10,936 --> 00:08:13,578
Of course. Whatever you say.

102
00:08:15,484 --> 00:08:16,314
Shit.

103
00:08:22,278 --> 00:08:23,405
Hold it, hold it, hold it.

104
00:08:23,481 --> 00:08:25,094
Wait, don't wash that.

105
00:08:26,764 --> 00:08:29,896
When I was working in the Southern Sudan, the dinkas,

106
00:08:29,978 --> 00:08:35,130
I reattached the chief's index finger, so they made me an honorary member of their tribe.

107
00:08:35,936 --> 00:08:39,098
They made you a dinka just for sewing on a dinky dinka's finger?

108
00:08:40,027 --> 00:08:44,166
See, they have this blood ritual. They believe that if you share the same scar,

109
00:08:44,433 --> 00:08:45,999
you're united as warriors.

110
00:08:47,126 --> 00:08:48,902
What do you say, Sean? Are we a tribe?

111
00:08:50,199 --> 00:08:54,524
I have this thing about my fingers. I need them to operate.

112
00:08:54,907 --> 00:08:57,234
I know. Me, too.

113
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,066
I'm joking.

114
00:09:04,407 --> 00:09:07,452
Oh, come on. Look, I'm gonna go do that tattoo consult with you.

115
00:09:07,703 --> 00:09:10,320
You relax. I'm here to lighten your load, right?

116
00:09:11,112 --> 00:09:12,009
Let's go.

117
00:09:20,857 --> 00:09:24,405
Mr. Ramirez, tell us what you don't like about yourself.

118
00:09:24,681 --> 00:09:26,064
My skin.

119
00:09:26,621 --> 00:09:28,757
I want to get rid of my signs.

120
00:09:29,484 --> 00:09:33,298
See, there's this guy who teaches industrial arts at the youth authority,

121
00:09:33,436 --> 00:09:36,805
and he said he'd let me work at his electronics store if I get myself cleaned up

122
00:09:36,908 --> 00:09:38,904
and holy spirit church said they'd pay.

123
00:09:39,032 --> 00:09:41,562
The boys at ms-13 are gonna let you quit

124
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:42,831
just like that?

125
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:46,539
You know, they see I've done some time.

126
00:09:46,614 --> 00:09:48,634
You know, some good time for them I've been loyal.

127
00:09:48,791 --> 00:09:50,681
They'll let you go sometimes.

128
00:09:51,285 --> 00:09:55,397
But I'm through. I through even if that means I gotta get boxed out.

129
00:09:55,965 --> 00:09:58,188
I'm sorry. Boxed out?

130
00:09:58,814 --> 00:10:01,539
Well, see, they put you in this refrigerator box, they'll shut the door,

131
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:03,522
and they'll fire a dozen rounds into it.

132
00:10:03,611 --> 00:10:05,754
Now if you live, you out. You die...

133
00:10:12,138 --> 00:10:15,857
Mr. Ramirez, just because you and I are both of latin descent

134
00:10:15,917 --> 00:10:17,602
doesn't mean we speak the same language.

135
00:10:17,674 --> 00:10:18,615
Quentin, I--

136
00:10:18,697 --> 00:10:21,472
Castro opens his prisons and he floods our shores with marielitos,

137
00:10:21,534 --> 00:10:24,597
and they do what they've always done. They steal, they sell drugs, and they breed.

138
00:10:24,611 --> 00:10:27,111
Hey. Hey, look at me, man.

139
00:10:27,197 --> 00:10:29,722
You don't disrespect me like I'm not even here, huh?

140
00:10:29,905 --> 00:10:31,846
Oh, you want me to respect you?

141
00:10:31,924 --> 00:10:35,947
Why don't you tell Dr. McNamara here what those tears represent.

142
00:10:41,471 --> 00:10:42,925
One tear--

143
00:10:44,743 --> 00:10:46,545
one tear for every kill.

144
00:10:57,687 --> 00:11:01,254
Look, I was 10. I was 10, eating garbage.

145
00:11:01,543 --> 00:11:05,279
You know, shitting my guts out, moaning like some dog in an alley.

146
00:11:05,458 --> 00:11:06,994
That's how they found me.

147
00:11:07,154 --> 00:11:10,860
They gave me some tequila and some weed, we start laughing. We start kicking back.

148
00:11:10,973 --> 00:11:14,572
You know, for the first time in my life, I had some family.

149
00:11:14,633 --> 00:11:16,333
I had some place I could go.

150
00:11:17,456 --> 00:11:19,365
They asked me if I wanted to jump in.

151
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:22,159
And then, they rushed me, they beat me up,

152
00:11:22,397 --> 00:11:24,920
then they shook my hand. That was it. I was in.

153
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:31,786
From that day on, I never cried, not once. Not until the day--

154
00:11:32,466 --> 00:11:35,217
not until the day that Prima's mom spoke in court.

155
00:11:39,225 --> 00:11:41,463
See, he was a banger just like me.

156
00:11:42,154 --> 00:11:44,980
You know, I expected his mom to come in there screaming and stuff, but she didn't.

157
00:11:45,007 --> 00:11:46,874
She said that she forgave me.

158
00:11:46,972 --> 00:11:49,942
Like she forgave Prima because she couldn't do no better for him.

159
00:11:51,548 --> 00:11:56,910
She said that I had goodness in me.

160
00:11:57,559 --> 00:12:02,313
That god is the only one that had the whole story on me, and it wasn't written in no police file.

161
00:12:05,905 --> 00:12:09,106
I'm sorry to interrupt, Sean, but you've got a call on line one.

162
00:12:09,205 --> 00:12:10,632
I'm in a consult.

163
00:12:10,686 --> 00:12:13,525
It's Julia. She's calling from the police station.

164
00:12:24,605 --> 00:12:25,813
What the hell is going on?

165
00:12:25,904 --> 00:12:27,415
Adrian's dead.

166
00:12:27,788 --> 00:12:29,889
Ava's son, Adrian.

167
00:12:30,006 --> 00:12:32,485
Matt was over at the house. He found him.

168
00:12:32,756 --> 00:12:34,239
He'd been stabbed.

169
00:12:34,426 --> 00:12:35,807
- She do it?
- Sean--

170
00:12:35,863 --> 00:12:37,902
They were having an incestuous relationship, Julia.

171
00:12:37,935 --> 00:12:40,738
- Maybe he tried to stop it.
- That was a lie. They never slept together.

172
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:43,508
What were you doing there in the first place? We had an agreement.

173
00:12:43,531 --> 00:12:44,992
You promised us it was over.

174
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:48,899
Ava wouldn't hurt him or anyone. She's not capable of it.

175
00:12:49,099 --> 00:12:50,788
Sorry to keep you folks waiting.

176
00:12:50,831 --> 00:12:52,037
I'm detective Bowser.

177
00:12:52,055 --> 00:12:56,318
- Look, if my son isn't a suspect--
- My office, doctor, my questions.

178
00:13:02,017 --> 00:13:04,581
The only fingerprints on the knife were the victim's.

179
00:13:05,104 --> 00:13:07,638
Right now, it looks like a suicide.

180
00:13:08,468 --> 00:13:09,544
Surprised?

181
00:13:12,815 --> 00:13:13,842
No.

182
00:13:14,853 --> 00:13:16,670
He was pretty screwed up.

183
00:13:16,905 --> 00:13:18,268
About what?

184
00:13:18,396 --> 00:13:25,359
He, um... had a history of mental problems, according to his mother.

185
00:13:25,507 --> 00:13:27,392
Would you happen to know where she is at present?

186
00:13:27,424 --> 00:13:30,950
We would like to notify her, ask her some questions.

187
00:13:32,122 --> 00:13:33,481
She's in Paris.

188
00:13:34,345 --> 00:13:35,881
At least she was.

189
00:13:36,111 --> 00:13:37,945
Could you be a little more specific?

190
00:13:38,038 --> 00:13:39,931
Well, we haven't been in touch.

191
00:13:41,007 --> 00:13:43,960
Why were you in her house when you knew she was out of the country?

192
00:13:44,042 --> 00:13:47,390
All right, that's it. My son is not a suspect here. He's under no obligation--

193
00:13:47,472 --> 00:13:49,234
There was an extra ticket.

194
00:13:49,797 --> 00:13:53,581
I went there to try and find it, so that I could go and be with her.

195
00:13:59,919 --> 00:14:01,112
I love her,

196
00:14:01,722 --> 00:14:04,256
and there's nothing you can do about it.

197
00:14:05,285 --> 00:14:07,385
You're just about her son's age.

198
00:14:07,411 --> 00:14:08,365
Isn't that right?

199
00:14:08,455 --> 00:14:09,719
Let's go, Matt. We're leaving.

200
00:14:09,954 --> 00:14:12,591
When was the last time you saw her, Dr. McNamara?

201
00:14:17,901 --> 00:14:22,720
Uh... our interaction was minimal.

202
00:14:23,989 --> 00:14:25,908
But there was interaction?

203
00:14:30,711 --> 00:14:34,822
She came into my office for a small procedure before she left.

204
00:14:36,339 --> 00:14:37,854
What kind of procedure?

205
00:14:37,886 --> 00:14:40,092
- Matt, it doesn't concern you.
- No, I want to know.

206
00:14:45,837 --> 00:14:48,248
It was a vaginal reconstruction.

207
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:52,320
The final phase of a transsexual operation she'd had 16 years ago.

208
00:15:04,884 --> 00:15:07,715
You lying son of a bitch.

209
00:15:07,722 --> 00:15:10,284
I can show you the medical documentation if you don't believe me.

210
00:15:10,332 --> 00:15:12,087
- Matty, sweetheart--
- No!

211
00:15:12,149 --> 00:15:14,995
You know what? You'd say anything to make her look sick and disgusting

212
00:15:15,057 --> 00:15:18,409
because whatever I love, for some reason, you have to destroy!

213
00:15:18,513 --> 00:15:20,504
- Matt--
- No! Both of you!

214
00:15:28,124 --> 00:15:30,360
You can catch up to him if you'd like.

215
00:15:30,795 --> 00:15:33,433
That's a lot of information to digest.

216
00:15:35,010 --> 00:15:36,054
For everyone.

217
00:15:38,457 --> 00:15:39,669
We'll be in touch.

218
00:15:43,175 --> 00:15:45,481
We agreed never to tell him.

219
00:15:45,517 --> 00:15:47,507
You heard what he was planning. I had no choice.

220
00:15:47,605 --> 00:15:49,422
You had a choice, Sean.

221
00:15:49,514 --> 00:15:53,437
You could have chosen to ask me what I thought was best for our child!

222
00:15:53,748 --> 00:15:56,247
We're not married anymore, Julia.

223
00:15:56,323 --> 00:15:59,156
You're no longer the head of our little clan 'cause it no longer exists.

224
00:15:59,218 --> 00:16:00,840
I can parent however I want to!

225
00:16:00,896 --> 00:16:04,501
If you don't like what I'm doing, then complain to somebody who cares!

226
00:16:05,229 --> 00:16:06,769
Go find someone.

227
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:44,744
Your cell was off.

228
00:16:47,503 --> 00:16:49,637
Why own one if you never keep it on?

229
00:17:03,523 --> 00:17:05,572
I'm not gonna hold your head if you puke.

230
00:17:25,253 --> 00:17:26,913
So is she a man or a woman?

231
00:17:28,941 --> 00:17:31,933
In your opinion as a medical expert?

232
00:17:33,799 --> 00:17:36,025
It's a little more complicated than that.

233
00:17:36,039 --> 00:17:37,204
Oh, really?

234
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:43,916
'Cause I thought if you had a dick, you were a guy.

235
00:17:43,998 --> 00:17:48,177
And, if you had a pussy, you were a-- I don't know.

236
00:17:48,283 --> 00:17:51,264
What do I know? I know shit.

237
00:18:01,018 --> 00:18:03,521
Some medical circles believe that

238
00:18:04,908 --> 00:18:09,537
even if transsexuals like Ava modify their bodies

239
00:18:09,559 --> 00:18:13,745
- to physically resemble a woman's...
- Oh, yeah. Right, resemble.

240
00:18:13,799 --> 00:18:16,818
They still can't reproduce or change their sex chromosomes,

241
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:23,116
which is technically what distinguishes a man from a woman.

242
00:18:25,163 --> 00:18:26,136
Excellent.

243
00:18:28,005 --> 00:18:31,139
So the best blowjobs I ever got were from a guy.

244
00:18:32,481 --> 00:18:33,345
Ok.

245
00:18:34,538 --> 00:18:37,426
What matters is how she views herself, Matt.

246
00:18:38,604 --> 00:18:41,737
Changing public perception may take some time.

247
00:18:42,633 --> 00:18:44,210
Thanks for the clarification.

248
00:18:48,987 --> 00:18:49,863
Matt...

249
00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:54,975
Dad, you should have told me when you found out.

250
00:18:55,021 --> 00:18:56,831
I made a deal with her, Matt,

251
00:18:57,246 --> 00:19:00,734
that I'd keep her secret and do the surgery if she agreed to leave.

252
00:19:01,111 --> 00:19:02,632
I didn't want to hurt you.

253
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:09,146
You put your patient's confidentiality before your own son!

254
00:19:09,410 --> 00:19:11,832
What kind of father would do that?

255
00:19:14,511 --> 00:19:17,440
Oh, right. I forgot.

256
00:19:18,209 --> 00:19:19,432
Not a real one.

257
00:19:44,504 --> 00:19:46,071
Quentin did an awesome job.

258
00:19:46,162 --> 00:19:48,001
Your scar's almost completely gone.

259
00:19:48,059 --> 00:19:51,242
Well, maybe you should have asked Quentin to do Kiki.

260
00:19:51,549 --> 00:19:53,562
I'm just asking you to meet her.

261
00:19:53,627 --> 00:19:56,275
- It.
- She has a soul.

262
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:59,332
She mimics hand gestures and slings her poo.

263
00:19:59,399 --> 00:20:00,965
What is it with you and this animal?

264
00:20:01,273 --> 00:20:04,252
She is an outcast from her tribe, and she is suffering because of it.

265
00:20:04,323 --> 00:20:05,757
I know what that feels like.

266
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:10,131
Ok, I just want to point out that it was you who compared yourself to a gorilla, not me.

267
00:20:10,585 --> 00:20:12,454
You think you've got nothing in common?

268
00:20:12,530 --> 00:20:15,982
She's gonna be attacked and killed, and you can't relate to that?

269
00:20:30,550 --> 00:20:32,714
Lucky for you those tats are homemade, homie.

270
00:20:32,796 --> 00:20:34,127
Yeah, lucky.

271
00:20:49,519 --> 00:20:51,203
Yellow and green is tough,

272
00:20:51,587 --> 00:20:53,900
but the black absorbs 100% of the light.

273
00:20:55,032 --> 00:20:56,189
It's pretty impressive, huh?

274
00:20:57,608 --> 00:20:59,604
How's our little scarface doing?

275
00:20:59,856 --> 00:21:01,480
She's ready for her close-up.

276
00:21:07,751 --> 00:21:08,842
You want a go?

277
00:21:09,932 --> 00:21:10,745
Yeah.

278
00:21:51,390 --> 00:21:52,305
Matt?

279
00:21:55,470 --> 00:21:56,340
Matt?

280
00:21:59,874 --> 00:22:00,881
Matt?

281
00:22:01,695 --> 00:22:04,261
Matt, I want to talk to you in person.

282
00:22:05,035 --> 00:22:06,667
Can I please come in?

283
00:23:10,406 --> 00:23:11,641
Hello, Matt.

284
00:23:21,717 --> 00:23:22,735
Want a hit?

285
00:23:22,873 --> 00:23:24,184
That's sweet of you.

286
00:23:24,277 --> 00:23:28,008
Granny has to hold on to what few brain cells she has left.

287
00:23:28,101 --> 00:23:31,086
Erica, you used the "g" word.

288
00:23:31,145 --> 00:23:33,104
Sounds awful, doesn't it?

289
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:35,775
Still I am your grandmother.

290
00:23:40,538 --> 00:23:44,535
Although I'll admit I haven't been a very good one.

291
00:23:46,851 --> 00:23:47,727
Oh.

292
00:23:48,791 --> 00:23:52,789
Mom called you about Ava.

293
00:23:52,999 --> 00:23:55,462
She doesn't often ask for my help, you know.

294
00:23:55,545 --> 00:23:58,273
I figured that was worth a 3-hour flight.

295
00:24:02,205 --> 00:24:05,740
Oh, what the hell. Brains are overrated anyway.

296
00:24:29,547 --> 00:24:34,728
You kids today, you have no idea what great weed tastes like.

297
00:24:35,409 --> 00:24:37,272
Were you a hippie, Erica?

298
00:24:37,514 --> 00:24:39,607
Do you mean did I protest the war?

299
00:24:41,210 --> 00:24:45,163
Did I dare to go outside the bounds of accepted behavior?

300
00:24:45,306 --> 00:24:48,623
Make up my own mind about whom to share my body with and why?

301
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:51,507
You bet your sweet ass I was.

302
00:24:52,725 --> 00:24:54,835
That's what's so wonderful about being young.

303
00:24:54,896 --> 00:24:57,900
There are no mistakes, only research.

304
00:25:06,324 --> 00:25:12,361
My research has led me to conclude, doctor, that I get hard for hermaphrodites.

305
00:25:12,663 --> 00:25:16,589
Oops, transsexuals. Excuse me.

306
00:25:16,836 --> 00:25:20,619
She was quite a conquest. Breathtaking beauty.

307
00:25:23,072 --> 00:25:24,925
She was so strong.

308
00:25:30,865 --> 00:25:32,605
The way she held me.

309
00:25:32,969 --> 00:25:36,501
So, you were attracted to her masculine side.

310
00:25:36,771 --> 00:25:38,943
- Never mind.
- It turned you on.

311
00:25:39,030 --> 00:25:43,858
It's quite natural for a young man your age to experiment.

312
00:25:43,915 --> 00:25:46,940
How else will you discover how the adult body works?

313
00:25:47,038 --> 00:25:49,230
That you have nerve endings that pleasure you?

314
00:25:49,301 --> 00:25:52,209
- Your nipples, your anus--
- Ok, stop it.

315
00:25:52,327 --> 00:25:55,706
Enjoying anal stimulation doesn't make you a homosexual.

316
00:25:55,804 --> 00:25:57,212
Are you worried you might be?

317
00:25:57,284 --> 00:25:58,906
You know what? Never mind.

318
00:26:03,325 --> 00:26:07,935
Listen to me. I don't care what kind of sex you have or with whom,

319
00:26:09,044 --> 00:26:13,453
but if you're so appalled by your own feelings that you deny their existence,

320
00:26:13,529 --> 00:26:18,240
they'll run your tight little ass for the rest of your oppressed middlebrow life.

321
00:26:19,150 --> 00:26:20,999
Do you want a safe life

322
00:26:21,466 --> 00:26:23,647
or an authentic one?

323
00:26:33,165 --> 00:26:35,971
Steroid cream, morning and night.

324
00:26:38,556 --> 00:26:39,949
So when do you start?

325
00:26:41,762 --> 00:26:43,354
That guy changed his mind.

326
00:26:45,283 --> 00:26:47,568
I don't know. I guess he never thought I'd do it, you know?

327
00:26:47,681 --> 00:26:51,064
When I showed up, he said it didn't feel right.

328
00:26:52,657 --> 00:26:54,607
There are other jobs, Marlon.

329
00:26:55,099 --> 00:26:59,380
Yeah. Yeah, like this woman, this old lady from church,

330
00:26:59,435 --> 00:27:01,720
she says she needs someone to walk her dogs,

331
00:27:01,914 --> 00:27:04,326
and I even put on a tie for the interview.

332
00:27:04,469 --> 00:27:08,042
Father Ortista told her about how I cleaned up. She said,

333
00:27:08,196 --> 00:27:12,011
"oh, come on. A leopard never changes its spots."

334
00:27:14,367 --> 00:27:17,274
She didn't even trust me enough to pick up dog shit.

335
00:27:17,776 --> 00:27:22,507
She's just narrow minded. Look, there are placement counselors, want ads.

336
00:27:22,610 --> 00:27:26,045
Eventually, someone will give you a shot.

337
00:27:26,430 --> 00:27:28,461
You ever been convicted of a crime?

338
00:27:30,565 --> 00:27:32,736
That's on every application.

339
00:27:32,871 --> 00:27:35,046
Now you answer straight up, you never gonna hear from them again.

340
00:27:35,117 --> 00:27:38,475
But if you lie, you're violating parole.

341
00:27:44,132 --> 00:27:48,609
I was wondering if maybe you had some work around here?

342
00:27:48,718 --> 00:27:51,942
You know, it doesn't matter what. I could empty some bed pans

343
00:27:52,014 --> 00:27:54,953
- or clean up some toilets or--
- I can't.

344
00:27:55,818 --> 00:27:57,902
I'm sorry, Marlon.

345
00:27:58,307 --> 00:28:02,638
It's against the law for anyone in the medical profession to employ an ex-offender.

346
00:28:03,632 --> 00:28:07,891
Oh, yeah. Ok. That's cool, man.

347
00:28:08,202 --> 00:28:09,718
You've done your job.

348
00:28:10,742 --> 00:28:12,140
I just figured it--

349
00:28:14,234 --> 00:28:16,026
I figured it didn't hurt to ask.

350
00:28:22,109 --> 00:28:23,430
Good luck, Marlon.

351
00:28:31,182 --> 00:28:32,765
And stay out of trouble, ok?

352
00:30:01,626 --> 00:30:03,481
- Hi.
- Hi.

353
00:30:05,401 --> 00:30:08,693
Uh, can I get an absolut martini straight up?

354
00:30:08,842 --> 00:30:13,402
You know, I should really ask for your I.D., but you're just too cute to card.

355
00:30:16,902 --> 00:30:20,370
I had very delicate hands, remember?

356
00:30:21,688 --> 00:30:24,560
Fingers that knew exactly how to touch you,

357
00:30:25,226 --> 00:30:26,562
where to touch you,

358
00:30:27,310 --> 00:30:28,753
and for how long.

359
00:30:31,652 --> 00:30:32,967
There you go, angel.

360
00:30:33,259 --> 00:30:34,266
Straight up.

361
00:30:35,465 --> 00:30:36,357
Thanks.

362
00:30:40,663 --> 00:30:42,490
You shouldn't compare them to me.

363
00:30:43,879 --> 00:30:45,327
I was the best.

364
00:30:46,583 --> 00:30:48,154
The Venus Di Milo.

365
00:30:49,311 --> 00:30:51,861
Besides, change takes time.

366
00:30:51,917 --> 00:30:54,626
You don't become a woman overnight. It's a lifetime process

367
00:30:55,870 --> 00:30:57,723
just like becoming a man.

368
00:30:58,768 --> 00:31:02,188
Are you man enough to make up your own mind about what pleases you?

369
00:31:03,436 --> 00:31:04,487
Me?

370
00:31:05,542 --> 00:31:08,260
Honey, you were too scared to tell me the truth.

371
00:31:08,987 --> 00:31:10,953
You knew I would have left you.

372
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:13,724
At least I have the courage to be who I am.

373
00:31:14,788 --> 00:31:15,893
Do you?

374
00:31:25,166 --> 00:31:26,876
Another one, please.

375
00:31:51,128 --> 00:31:52,184
Thank you.

376
00:31:56,568 --> 00:31:57,781
This seat taken?

377
00:32:03,772 --> 00:32:04,750
Buy me a drink?

378
00:32:12,723 --> 00:32:13,940
You're a good kisser.

379
00:32:27,786 --> 00:32:29,934
How about a little music? Hmm?

380
00:32:45,658 --> 00:32:46,718
There.

381
00:32:48,042 --> 00:32:49,652
- Isn't that better?
- Mm-hmm.

382
00:33:05,442 --> 00:33:07,080
Oh, you're soft...

383
00:33:08,099 --> 00:33:09,149
hard!

384
00:33:19,426 --> 00:33:22,185
That's nice. Oh, that feels nice.

385
00:33:24,546 --> 00:33:26,341
That's good, baby, don't stop.

386
00:33:26,783 --> 00:33:30,649
Oh, yeah. Oh... oh...

387
00:33:31,647 --> 00:33:33,874
Oh! Jesus Christ!

388
00:33:34,510 --> 00:33:36,122
Come on, baby. Down here.

389
00:33:36,208 --> 00:33:37,754
You've got a goddamn dick!

390
00:33:37,857 --> 00:33:39,561
I'll cum wherever you want. Whatever you say.

391
00:33:39,638 --> 00:33:41,370
You got a goddamn dick!

392
00:33:41,397 --> 00:33:44,595
Why didn't you tell me you were pre-op?! You should've told me!

393
00:33:46,956 --> 00:33:48,558
Relax, ok?

394
00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:51,180
It's the best of both. I didn't think I was your first.

395
00:33:51,987 --> 00:33:55,618
I don't want a girl with a dick, ok?

396
00:33:55,716 --> 00:33:58,357
I'm not gay, ok? I'm not into that!

397
00:33:59,346 --> 00:34:02,285
Oh, you should have told me instead of trying to trick me.

398
00:34:02,555 --> 00:34:04,102
I thought you were one of us.

399
00:34:04,210 --> 00:34:08,326
What?! Do I look like one of you, you sick piece of shit?!

400
00:34:09,268 --> 00:34:11,951
I don't like being screwed with, ok?

401
00:34:12,228 --> 00:34:15,179
I don't like it!

402
00:34:15,781 --> 00:34:17,225
Stop! No!

403
00:34:18,004 --> 00:34:20,455
No, you look at me when I'm talking to you.

404
00:34:21,963 --> 00:34:26,796
If I want to play with someone's cock, I got my own, you goddamn freak.

405
00:35:49,925 --> 00:35:51,032
What are you doing?

406
00:35:52,290 --> 00:35:54,660
You're always telling me to get it cut.

407
00:35:56,299 --> 00:35:57,799
I'm getting it cut.

408
00:36:00,610 --> 00:36:02,694
I'm not sure it's an improvement.

409
00:36:03,959 --> 00:36:05,437
It's too late now.

410
00:36:09,769 --> 00:36:13,841
I just got tired of looking at myself. I need a change.

411
00:36:26,399 --> 00:36:29,712
I'm not sure changing how you look is gonna change how you feel inside.

412
00:36:30,997 --> 00:36:33,209
Is that what you say to all your patients?

413
00:36:33,702 --> 00:36:37,613
That their bigger tits or their brand-new face isn't really gonna change anything?

414
00:36:37,629 --> 00:36:41,582
Shaving your head's not gonna make you feel more like a man if you don't feel it inside.

415
00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:43,562
I think you need to talk to someone...

416
00:36:43,736 --> 00:36:44,939
a professional...

417
00:36:45,430 --> 00:36:47,275
who deals with gender issues.

418
00:36:47,751 --> 00:36:50,945
I'm not gay, if that's what you're thinking, dad.

419
00:36:51,130 --> 00:36:55,917
Don't worry. Your masculinity will not be threatened in any way.

420
00:36:56,956 --> 00:36:59,415
You're almost unrecognizable.

421
00:37:02,568 --> 00:37:04,124
What happened to your knuckles?

422
00:37:06,512 --> 00:37:09,193
I got drunk and punched a wall.

423
00:37:12,717 --> 00:37:14,819
Guess who I was pretending it was.

424
00:37:34,292 --> 00:37:35,536
Matt called.

425
00:37:35,859 --> 00:37:38,361
Did he talk about his new neo-nazi haircut?

426
00:37:39,008 --> 00:37:40,507
You told him about Ava.

427
00:37:40,588 --> 00:37:43,425
Don't you think somebody should have told me? That it concerns me?

428
00:37:43,478 --> 00:37:45,371
Don't you think I should have been told that the laser I bought

429
00:37:45,433 --> 00:37:47,020
was sent back without my knowledge?

430
00:37:47,037 --> 00:37:49,176
I warned you, Sean. We can't afford it

431
00:37:49,252 --> 00:37:53,082
and the salary we're paying Quentin for you to play tweedle dee to his tweedle dum.

432
00:37:53,104 --> 00:37:55,897
Since when did you become so fiscally responsible?

433
00:37:55,950 --> 00:37:58,663
Maybe if you came to work instead of wasting time

434
00:37:58,735 --> 00:38:01,008
and money at the zoo operating on some ape...

435
00:38:01,069 --> 00:38:04,115
You can't seriously be criticizing me for doing pro bono work.

436
00:38:04,188 --> 00:38:06,487
I'm criticizing you for acting unilaterally.

437
00:38:06,562 --> 00:38:09,385
Look, either you're gonna be a part of the team or stay a self-pitying victim

438
00:38:09,441 --> 00:38:11,785
who takes out his aggression by undermining us.

439
00:38:11,867 --> 00:38:14,827
Us? By us you mean you and Quentin.

440
00:38:14,848 --> 00:38:17,249
It looks like you've gotta be around other victims to be comfortable...

441
00:38:17,325 --> 00:38:18,395
human or not.

442
00:38:18,488 --> 00:38:21,349
If that animal can teach its language skills to future generations,

443
00:38:21,411 --> 00:38:25,773
then I might have in some way made a scientific contribution to the world.

444
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:27,611
Me, not you.

445
00:38:27,704 --> 00:38:29,388
Isn't that what really bugs you, Sean?

446
00:38:29,465 --> 00:38:31,763
I did something. I felt effective.

447
00:38:32,183 --> 00:38:34,998
And for the first time in weeks, I forgot all about the carver.

448
00:38:41,251 --> 00:38:42,905
Dr. Forsythe called.

449
00:38:42,921 --> 00:38:44,430
How did the insemination go?

450
00:38:44,968 --> 00:38:47,461
They promised to name the first born after me.

451
00:38:47,540 --> 00:38:51,297
They thought enough time had passed, that the scar wouldn't be visible.

452
00:38:51,353 --> 00:38:55,383
Apparently, animals have a sixth sense about these things.

453
00:38:55,496 --> 00:38:58,349
We couldn't see it, but Koomba could.

454
00:38:59,292 --> 00:39:02,623
He knew that there was something different about her.

455
00:39:03,285 --> 00:39:05,039
He attacked her.

456
00:39:06,861 --> 00:39:08,195
Kiki's dead.

457
00:39:28,109 --> 00:39:32,661
Matt, goddamn it! I can smell the dope all the way from the kitchen!

458
00:39:38,028 --> 00:39:41,826
I was going to pay him for it, but more than it's worth.

459
00:39:41,887 --> 00:39:45,866
You have to smoke a lid of this shit to get a decent buzz.

460
00:40:05,247 --> 00:40:08,451
Are you gonna bogart the damn thing or offer me some?

461
00:40:08,527 --> 00:40:09,654
Oh, here.

462
00:40:25,871 --> 00:40:29,764
We should have done more of this when I was growing up.

463
00:40:29,828 --> 00:40:35,853
You disapproved of me enough without adding corruption to the list of my war crimes.

464
00:40:37,055 --> 00:40:39,037
But you were a terrible mother.

465
00:40:39,324 --> 00:40:40,926
I thought I was...

466
00:40:41,674 --> 00:40:44,742
But it turned out I didn't do such a bad job.

467
00:40:46,932 --> 00:40:49,503
You mean, compared to me?

468
00:40:49,594 --> 00:40:53,619
No, I mean as evidenced by you.

469
00:41:02,825 --> 00:41:05,021
We're all terrible mothers.

470
00:41:05,954 --> 00:41:11,961
You go into the enterprise expecting your child to be a better version of yourself.

471
00:41:12,268 --> 00:41:16,854
And then the little bastards turn out to have souls all their own,

472
00:41:16,962 --> 00:41:19,271
destinies to be fulfilled,

473
00:41:19,516 --> 00:41:24,282
dreams and desires that have nothing to do with us or our D.N.A.

474
00:41:25,676 --> 00:41:29,864
I mean, I--I carried him inside of me and...

475
00:41:31,821 --> 00:41:33,997
it's just as if I don't even know him.

476
00:41:34,257 --> 00:41:35,364
You will again.

477
00:41:37,115 --> 00:41:37,965
When?

478
00:41:38,153 --> 00:41:39,556
When you grow up.

479
00:41:40,559 --> 00:41:41,606
Me?

480
00:41:42,414 --> 00:41:47,022
When you stop trying to create him in your image and likeness...

481
00:41:47,156 --> 00:41:49,459
and see him for who he is.

482
00:41:56,110 --> 00:41:58,117
You're stoned.

483
00:42:02,228 --> 00:42:06,590
You're right. We should have done this more often.

484
00:43:13,397 --> 00:43:14,621
Holy shit.

485
00:43:48,245 --> 00:43:49,365
Come here!

486
00:44:23,301 --> 00:44:24,622
Come on! Get him!

487
00:44:36,501 --> 00:44:37,903
You like that?

488
00:44:49,702 --> 00:44:51,033
Take that.

489
00:45:14,736 --> 00:45:15,912
Matt?

490
00:45:25,988 --> 00:45:29,854
