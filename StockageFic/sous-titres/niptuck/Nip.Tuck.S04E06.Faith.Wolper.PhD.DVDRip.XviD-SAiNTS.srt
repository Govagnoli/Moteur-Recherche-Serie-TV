1
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:02,599
Previously on Nip / Tuck...

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:06,512
I don't think it would be appropriate
for you to work for us, Monica.

3
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:09,399
The thing is, Sean,
some men can't handle temptation.

4
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:10,873
Marry me again, Julia.

5
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:12,518
Sean, what are you doing?

6
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:14,034
And some men can.

7
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:16,236
Burt can't find out about this.

8
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:17,435
He won't.

9
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,397
Christian, have you ever
considered the possibility

10
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:21,391
that you're in love with your partner?

11
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:34,116
Great spot, huh?

12
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,600
I feel a little exposed out here, don't you?

13
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:39,392
We're miles from home, Sean.

14
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:42,040
Nobody knows who we are,
and nobody's gonna judge.

15
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:44,156
It's safe, I promise.

16
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:51,676
Great.
Now let's go find ourselves a chaise.

17
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,194
This is so perfect.

18
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:22,189
We got the sun, we got the pool.
We got each other.

19
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:23,992
It's so hot.

20
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:27,958
And why does everyone here
look like they're covered in Crisco?

21
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:30,679
Don't they know
they're all gonna get skin cancer?

22
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:35,951
I know it's hard, Sean.

23
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,276
Studies show that coming out late in life

24
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:41,318
is the psychological equivalent
of dealing with a death.

25
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:45,796
That's why I'm here to help you adjust.

26
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:52,712
And we're gonna start
by waxing this chest hair off.

27
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:56,116
No wonder you're broiling.
It's like you're wearing a sweater.

28
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:58,476
I like my hair, Christian.

29
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,518
And I like bathing suits
that come down to my knees.

30
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:05,278
This lifestyle isn't for me.

31
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,438
I'm sorry.

32
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,558
Hey, gorgeous.

33
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:18,071
Do you wanna play?

34
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,639
Sean?

35
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,592
Sean?

36
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:01,277
Honey, what are you doing in the closet?

37
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:04,876
I have a family, Christian.
I can't do this anymore.

38
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:08,837
Well, can you at least come out
so we can talk about it?

39
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:24,230
Fine. If you won't come out, I'm coming in.

40
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:39,949
I think we can save him.

41
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,678
Hand me the bowl.

42
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,629
What do you think?

43
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,438
Definitely more gay.

44
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,317
Shit. We're losing him.

45
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,958
Stand back.

46
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,832
Clear.

47
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:47,272
He needs CPR, Christian. The kiss of life.

48
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:12,036
- Another bad dream?
- Yeah.

49
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:18,589
Real change takes time.
Long as we have each other, right?

50
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:22,791
Yeah.

51
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:41,229
Saturday night, yes, 6:00.

52
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:44,633
My wife and I are celebrating
our second honeymoon.

53
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:49,398
Great. Thank you very much.

54
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:55,473
We're set. I got us a suite
at the Four Seasons with dinner

55
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,719
and an in-room couples massage.

56
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:02,233
Better than the first honeymoon we spent
at my parents' house, huh?

57
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:04,754
- Oh, I remember having fun.
- Oh, yeah.

58
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:07,559
I remember having to put our faces
in a pillow every time we had sex

59
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:09,437
so we wouldn't make noise.

60
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:13,156
This time, you and I can make
all the noise we want.

61
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:19,118
You don't think
we're being bad parents, do you?

62
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:21,760
Leaving Conor for an overnight so soon?

63
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,798
I mean, we didn't leave
Matt and Annie till they were what, two?

64
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:28,236
It's just one night.
And we've got great help, remember?

65
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:30,788
Julia, do you have any Pepto-Bismol?
Like, immediately.

66
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,440
- For Conor?
- No. No, no, no, he's fine.

67
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:36,598
It's for me. I think it was the sushi
I had last night. Bad unagi.

68
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:38,318
Did you throw up?

69
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,153
No, that's not exactly
where it's coming out of right now.

70
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:43,117
I can write you a scrip for Compazine
if you want.

71
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,918
No, I'm sure I'll be fine.

72
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,909
I hope it's nothing serious.

73
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:02,758
First day back. How you feeling?

74
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:06,071
Pain's still there.
Plus, I have to tinkle every 10 minutes.

75
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:09,516
Other than that,
I feel I'm gonna die at an early age.

76
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:12,034
You wait.
The one kidney'll pick up all the slack.

77
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:14,918
In a couple of weeks,
you'll go right back to normal.

78
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,118
Is that the Village People?

79
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,918
I thought you'd recognize it.

80
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,719
I've been replacing all my
old college records with CDs lately.

81
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:32,634
- I forgot how much fun these guys were.
- We're not in college anymore, Sean.

82
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:36,998
And this is my operating room, too.
I need music that I can work with.

83
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:39,355
I hear that extends to
who you can work with, as well.

84
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:43,035
I understand you brought Michelle in here
the other day to assist in a surgery.

85
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,838
What the hell were you doing?

86
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:50,677
We all thought it. He can say it.

87
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:53,118
She wanted to observe.

88
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,760
She's been through medical school,
spent some time in the OR.

89
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,273
The patient was never in any danger.

90
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:00,670
But we are now because you can't keep
your dick in your pants.

91
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:04,395
I know you're sleeping with her,
and it has to stop, Christian.

92
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,754
When you came to me with the story

93
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,717
about the naughty little nanny
that you banged,

94
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,472
did I tell you what to do?

95
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,554
That was just between us.

96
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:15,677
If I'm supportive of your affairs, Sean,
you can't have a say in mine.

97
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:18,069
Well, if screwing the boss
means that we can all get fired,

98
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,309
you're damn right I have a say.

99
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,231
I happen to have
very strong feelings for Michelle.

100
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,912
You might want to keep those to yourself.

101
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,592
Why? You got a problem with it now, too?

102
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:27,592
No, I don't. But he might.

103
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:36,554
I'm in the middle of surgery,
Burt, so whatever this is about...

104
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,631
Believe me, it can wait.

105
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:43,478
Why are you wearing a coat?
You don't have a gun under there, do you?

106
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:45,391
Yes. And it's loaded.

107
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,949
Is that... What is that?

108
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:53,033
It's a penis pump.
I ordered it online to help me get it up.

109
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,350
It came this morning, I put it on and look.

110
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,192
Congratulations. It works.

111
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:59,236
No shit. I wouldn't be here if it didn't.

112
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:02,073
The problem is, it won't come off.

113
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:03,918
What do you want me to do?

114
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,594
Well, you're my doctor.
Why do you think I'm here? Get it off me.

115
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:08,989
I don't think you need a doctor, Burt.
Just pull.

116
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:13,915
Don't you think I tried that? My goddamn
arthritis won't even let me get a grip on it.

117
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:16,911
Take a seat.

118
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:24,434
The blood's probably stagnant,
so it can't re-circulate.

119
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:27,751
You're lucky you didn't burst
a blood vessel.

120
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:31,276
Why didn't you ask your wife to help?

121
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,356
And let her see me like this?

122
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,112
It's bad enough having fake gonads,

123
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:38,636
now I gotta tell her I need
a bicycle pump to get it on?

124
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:42,750
Put this on your gonads.
Take two of these.

125
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:50,832
Ice will help the swelling go down
and Sudafed will thin out the blood.

126
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:52,831
Just try and relax.

127
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:59,550
My first wife, she was hot as a pistol.

128
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:03,230
We used to hump like rabbits
every time we could get a chance.

129
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:06,273
We were married nearly 20 years.

130
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:10,276
And then she got leukemia and passed on.

131
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,874
And I never thought I'd find
another one like her.

132
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:18,115
God. And then along came Michelle.

133
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:21,869
What a gift, huh?

134
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:29,908
For the first time in my life, all I wanna do
is please her, not just myself.

135
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:34,194
I never felt like that before.

136
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:40,192
I think it's working.

137
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,353
Good.

138
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:50,830
Well, that's different.

139
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:53,639
It might take a while for the erection
to go away completely.

140
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:54,835
Really?

141
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,992
How long you think it could last?

142
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,878
I'm sure your wife is busy.

143
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:04,349
Trust me, she won't mind.

144
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:09,593
Honey, have I got a surprise for you.

145
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:17,270
Thanks for all your help.

146
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,870
Hello, Christian.

147
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:52,235
I hope this isn't a bad time.
I wanted to come by and thank you.

148
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,397
Well, it was good for me, too, Doctor,

149
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,596
but you could've just left
a message on my machine.

150
00:12:56,680 --> 00:13:01,470
That's why I wanted to see you in person.
The sex was not good for me at all.

151
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,674
I'm a diagnosed sexual compulsive.

152
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:08,432
Sex with strangers has been an issue

153
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:11,193
ever since my cousin
molested me when I was 12.

154
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:13,669
I've been in therapy for years.

155
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:17,594
I thought I had it under control,
but clearly I don't.

156
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:20,400
And now you wanna thank me
for helping you fall off the wagon?

157
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:24,234
I wanna thank you for helping me realize
I still have a problem.

158
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:29,438
And actually, I was hoping that
you would do me a favor.

159
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:37,718
Wow, you really do have a problem,
don't you, Doctor?

160
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,832
Who's Marco?

161
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:51,998
Someone I had a relationship with
five years ago.

162
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:55,192
We met after I answered his want ad
for a submissive.

163
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:59,108
He gave me the tattoo so when he
watched me have sex with other men,

164
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:01,475
they'd know who I really belonged to.

165
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:02,788
Marco was a romantic.

166
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:06,190
Marco was the low point of my life, I think.

167
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:08,875
Until I had sex with you in my office.

168
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:12,991
I don't remember seeing that
when I was holding on back there.

169
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:16,914
I cover it every day with makeup.
I've had so much shame surrounding it

170
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,912
I haven't even been able to bring myself
to show it to a doctor

171
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,560
so that I can have it taken off.

172
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,157
And yet here you are.

173
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:30,636
I spend months,
sometimes years with people

174
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:33,553
trying to change their behavior in therapy.

175
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:39,109
God knows I thought I'd changed.

176
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:42,552
But the truth is
nothing ever really happens

177
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:44,312
unless you take action in your life.

178
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:46,789
And I was hoping
that you would help me do that.

179
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,871
How's tomorrow sound?

180
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,912
Jules? I got Chinese for dinner.

181
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,798
Did you get enough for three?

182
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:11,754
Sean, you remember Monica?

183
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:15,793
Hello, Dr. McNamara.

184
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:17,677
Hello, Monica.

185
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:20,640
Guess what I found out this morning?

186
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:24,871
Marlowe has a stomach virus.

187
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:26,957
He threw up all over the house.

188
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,951
I took him to the emergency room,

189
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:31,793
and the doctor said that
he can't be around Conor for a week.

190
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:34,430
- That's terrible.
- Which meant no nanny.

191
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:37,592
So I called Monica to see if
she could refer someone,

192
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:41,912
and she said that she was still in town
and she'd be happy to fill in.

193
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:44,193
Really?

194
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:48,553
I thought this way, if it works out, then
we don't have to cancel the honeymoon.

195
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:52,077
Oh, he just woke up. I'll get him.

196
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,593
What the hell are you trying to do?

197
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:03,116
Nothing. She called me. She sounded
so desperate. I wanted to help.

198
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:05,919
Well, you're not gonna stay in this house
and take care of my son.

199
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,275
Well, if I say no now,
wouldn't she get suspicious?

200
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:10,396
How could you even say yes
in the first place?

201
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:13,392
I needed the money.
I haven't found any work yet.

202
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:16,679
Look, don't worry.

203
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:20,674
I will be completely professional
this week.

204
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:23,149
Our secret is safe.

205
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:27,551
Haven't you learned you can trust me yet?

206
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:33,473
Oh, he is so handsome.

207
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:36,552
He's a little cranky when he first gets up.

208
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:39,274
- Can I hold him?
- Sure.

209
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,718
Hi, there.

210
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,710
I think he likes you.

211
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:53,153
What a relief I found her, huh?

212
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:37,156
Isn't your partner going to join us?
I was hoping to meet him.

213
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:40,437
Sean and I do a lot more
solo surgeries these days.

214
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:41,748
Is that a recent decision?

215
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,478
Ever since our first session.

216
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:46,870
So I take it you told Sean
about your feelings for him, then.

217
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:51,277
The answer to your question is no.
I didn't tell him what we talked about.

218
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,669
I'm not gay, so it's not an issue.

219
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:56,320
It sounds like you're conflicted
about something.

220
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:17,631
I had a dream the other night.
Sean and I were lovers.

221
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:21,753
I said something,
he freaked out and hid in the closet.

222
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:27,833
I went in after him and wound up
in surgery, and there he was on the table.

223
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:32,395
Next thing I know, he's dead.

224
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:36,158
But then I wake up,
and he's in bed next to me.

225
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:39,200
In the dream, not in reality.

226
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:42,030
Just because we have dreams
where we can fly

227
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:44,839
doesn't make us Superman, Christian.

228
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:51,237
There was another person in the dream,
a woman.

229
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:55,396
Someone you care about, perhaps?

230
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:56,959
Yes.

231
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:59,190
And you've been intimate
with this person?

232
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,469
Definitely.

233
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:05,920
I really like this person, but it's
a relationship I need to keep secret.

234
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:08,991
It seems like your desire
to be with this woman

235
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:11,509
is being expressed through
your dream about Sean.

236
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:14,319
So you're saying if I'm dreaming about
spending my life with Sean,

237
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,595
I really wanna spend my life with her?

238
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:20,197
If you really want to ease your anxiety
about all this,

239
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:23,278
you need to confront the woman
you care about.

240
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:25,550
Tell her how you really feel.

241
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:35,357
There you are.

242
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:40,429
I've been waiting for you
to come out of surgery.

243
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:42,991
Ran a little longer than I thought.

244
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:47,957
Feels like we haven't
seen each other in days.

245
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:50,949
We need some time together.

246
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:54,996
Well, you're in luck.
My 10:00 a. m. consult just rescheduled.

247
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:58,959
I know.
I'm the one who asked them to come later.

248
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:10,994
I thought you could
make me come now, instead.

249
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:17,317
Sorry. I'm not interested
in sloppy seconds anymore.

250
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:22,238
Burt hasn't been able to have sex with me
in almost six months, Christian.

251
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,796
Yesterday in your office?

252
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:29,598
He tried. But things went soft pretty fast.

253
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:32,513
And now you want me
to be your stand-in dick.

254
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:40,430
You're not just a stand-in, Christian.
You know that.

255
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:45,517
No, I'm literally someone you need to lock
in a room just so you can have an orgasm.

256
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:50,235
I can't keep
giving you just a part of me anymore,

257
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:51,998
and not all of me.

258
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:54,068
What are you saying?

259
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:55,832
I'm saying I know you're never gonna
leave Burt.

260
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:57,512
And that's probably for the best.

261
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,876
If he did find out about us,
we'd lose the practice,

262
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,599
I'd lose my partner,
and we'd lose each other anyway.

263
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,036
It's over.

264
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,514
You're right.

265
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:20,079
We probably should've stopped this
a long time ago.

266
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,312
I'm sorry.

267
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:27,830
You're not sorry.
You got exactly what you wanted.

268
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:29,433
You're still married, you're still rich,

269
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:32,273
you still got to screw
the good-looking hotshot surgeon.

270
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:34,516
I'm sure you'll move on
to someone else now.

271
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:37,068
You think it's that easy for me?

272
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:39,999
That I had it all planned out like this?

273
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:43,630
I'm the one who's trapped now, not you.

274
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:52,710
Next time you decide to reschedule
a client, check with me first.

275
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:05,712
Just a sec.

276
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:11,469
Oh, my God, I am so glad you're here.

277
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:14,438
I was just thinking I could use a doctor.

278
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:16,754
What are you doing?

279
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:20,953
Something I've always wanted to do.
Pierce my bellybutton.

280
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:25,879
You wanna do the honors?

281
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:28,030
No. I really shouldn't stay.

282
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:32,551
I couldn't say anything earlier
'cause Julia was there,

283
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:35,950
but after having time to sleep on it
I just don't think that...

284
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:39,239
Wait, you're going to hurt yourself.

285
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:47,352
You have to sterilize the area first.

286
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:05,268
I guess you've done this before?

287
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:07,078
Needle.

288
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:11,597
The key is to do this as fast as possible.
Do you have the ring?

289
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:13,398
Yep.

290
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:18,239
Close your eyes.

291
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:22,996
Are you kidding?
I finally get to watch you work.

292
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:40,480
I didn't even feel it.

293
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:06,508
Next time you won't need my help.

294
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:12,878
You're paying me in advance?

295
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:15,076
It's more like a severance.

296
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:24,392
You don't have to pay me off, Sean.
I'm a big girl. I can take care of myself.

297
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:27,870
I heard what you said about not
finding work and needing money.

298
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:32,798
And you've been very kind,
considering the circumstances.

299
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:36,351
I should get going.

300
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:51,790
It's amazing.
There's not a trace of it anywhere.

301
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:54,872
Think of all the money
you'll save on makeup.

302
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:59,635
I wanna thank you for all your help.

303
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:03,235
No, thank you.
I took your advice the other day.

304
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:06,835
The woman in my dream? Called it off.
She was married.

305
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:09,554
And that complicated more
than just my personal life.

306
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:12,792
She and her husband own our business.

307
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:15,834
That's great.

308
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:19,794
Then why do you look like
I just killed your dog?

309
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:23,835
I thought... Never mind what I thought.

310
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:27,674
No, no, no, no. You're my patient now.
Tell me.

311
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:32,517
I thought the woman
you were talking about was me.

312
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:36,912
Silly, right? Yeah, I know.
My radar was off.

313
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:41,398
I overanalyzed.
But it's something shrinks do.

314
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:47,239
But thank you for everything
and good luck.

315
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:49,154
Great.

316
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,309
Jules?

317
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:13,469
Honey?

318
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:15,198
Oh, it's okay, I got him.

319
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:39,190
Julia was right.
He gets so fussy when he wakes up.

320
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:42,314
I think he might be teething.

321
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:46,393
Oh, it's okay. I got him.

322
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:48,638
Where's Julia?

323
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:51,071
She's at her Pilates class.

324
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:54,630
Guess she's still trying
to lose some of that baby weight.

325
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:58,789
Not that she has a stomach you'd want
to see a bellybutton ring on now.

326
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,199
Give me my son.

327
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:01,878
He just calmed down.

328
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:06,471
I thought no one was home,
and he just kept reaching for it,

329
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:11,516
and I didn't want him to cry.
I'm not that insensitive.

330
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:12,869
No!

331
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:17,078
Hand me my son and leave,
or I'm calling the police.

332
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:22,634
And I'll have to tell them about the affair.
Julia will find out. Your marriage is over.

333
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:25,029
Then who do you think
is really gonna suffer?

334
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:31,673
Conor. I'm the only one who's doing
what's best for your baby, not you.

335
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:51,434
Get the hell out. Now!

336
00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:02,036
You took advantage of me, Sean.
And Julia needs to know about that.

337
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:23,751
You can quit it with
the silent treatment, Sean.

338
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:27,719
I gave Michelle the big speech. It's over.
We're not gonna lose our jobs.

339
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:30,872
She's breastfeeding him.

340
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,598
Julia? What's so special about that?

341
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:34,272
Monica. I came home yesterday

342
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:36,430
and caught her with her breast
in my son's mouth.

343
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:39,671
What the hell was she doing in your
house, anyway? I thought you fired her.

344
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:43,435
And Julia rehired her to watch Conor
while Marlowe's out sick.

345
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:47,316
I kicked her out,
now she's threatening to tell Julia.

346
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:51,749
Let her.

347
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:55,116
She might as well cop to the Kennedy
assassination while she's at it.

348
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,270
Tell Julia
about the psychotic breastfeeding,

349
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:59,555
and she won't believe a word Monica says.

350
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:03,030
That girl is clearly a nut job.

351
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:07,790
You realize between the two of us, we've
almost ruined a marriage and a business

352
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:10,559
by screwing the wrong women this month.

353
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:13,276
What the hell is our problem?

354
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:19,991
She only said that to worry you, Sean.
She's not gonna tell Julia.

355
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:38,231
You think my shit don't stink, Sean?

356
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:40,032
What are you talking about?

357
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:43,510
My shit. It don't stink, right?

358
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:45,718
I mean, you gotta believe that

359
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:49,839
if you think Monica ain't gonna tell
your wife about you banging her.

360
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:54,269
And you know what Julia's really gonna do
when she finds out, right?

361
00:29:55,440 --> 00:30:00,355
You're never gonna have any peace
as long as this bitch is in the picture.

362
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:03,871
What am I supposed to do?

363
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:08,435
Kill her.

364
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:30,559
What are you doing here?

365
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:35,273
Burt called.
Something about not feeling well.

366
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:37,032
He said it was an emergency.

367
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:40,430
Yeah, he asked me to come home, too.
He said he wasn't feeling well.

368
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:43,557
Is that Dr. Troy I hear?

369
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:49,589
Come into the library.
There's something I want to show you.

370
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:05,512
A little token of my appreciation.

371
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:08,516
Well, open 'em up.

372
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:27,679
What is this?

373
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:33,075
Well, I thought you might want to wear
them the next time you two have sex.

374
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:39,788
I smelled it on you, honey.

375
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:45,636
Burt, I am so sorry.

376
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:50,312
I gave you the world,
and this is how you repay me?

377
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:53,429
The same goes for you.

378
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:01,073
You should know it's over between us.

379
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:04,313
Oh?

380
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:09,474
Well, what if I don't want it to be?

381
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:19,468
I wish I could be the lover I was 30 years
ago with you, Michelle, but I can't.

382
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:26,472
You know, the most beautiful thing
in the world I've ever seen

383
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:29,393
is that glow you get
after you've had an orgasm.

384
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:32,552
And I wanna see that again.

385
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:36,198
And you're the one
that can give it to her now.

386
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:42,074
No, Burt, I can't. I won't.

387
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:47,196
Don't worry, honey.
I'm gonna be there when it happens.

388
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:50,517
I think it's only fair that I get to watch.
Don't you?

389
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:54,912
Watch? What makes you think either of us
would agree to let you do that?

390
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,797
Well, I think I'm being very generous here.

391
00:32:56,880 --> 00:33:00,998
I'm not interested in being your hired stud.
You wanna be generous, then let her go.

392
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:02,195
- Christian...
- No, no.

393
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:05,192
It's the right thing to do.
If you want her to be happy,

394
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:07,874
let her be with me, instead of some
freak show of a marriage.

395
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:10,030
This is about more than sex.

396
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:13,518
Do you love him?

397
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:17,229
Yes.

398
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:20,472
Burt, please.
You're making this more difficult.

399
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:22,676
No, it's you two that's making it difficult.

400
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:24,751
I'm just trying to make the most
of a shitty situation.

401
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:27,229
Michelle has suffered enough.
There's no need to be so cruel.

402
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:29,311
Oh, cruel? You want cruel?

403
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,798
All right. First, I sell the business.

404
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:36,997
And then, after I've sued you
for negligence, you'll be lucky to find

405
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:41,153
a job as a veterinarian in some
shithole South American village.

406
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:45,157
And when I'm done dragging you
over the coals in a divorce court,

407
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:48,710
you'll go back to your gutter
where I found you.

408
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:53,353
Go ahead. I'm not gonna be your whore.

409
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:58,639
I swear on these fake balls of mine,
that I will ruin you both

410
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:02,349
before I give my blessing so you can
run away and play happy-ever-after.

411
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:13,918
I'll give you 24 hours,
and you can give me an answer.

412
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:27,352
I took your advice. I...

413
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:33,075
I confronted them. I made the offer.

414
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:34,349
And?

415
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:36,954
And I feel like shit.

416
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:41,912
Did I really do the right thing?

417
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,230
You don't know if they're gonna
follow through with it yet.

418
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:47,630
But even making the offer,
it almost killed me.

419
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:50,712
Burt, you've been through a lot this year.

420
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:54,839
The cancer, losing your ability
to function as a sexual person,

421
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:57,514
discovering the affair.

422
00:34:57,600 --> 00:35:00,160
Getting your power back is what these
intensive sessions

423
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:02,356
over the past couple of days
have been about.

424
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:04,351
I hope you're not losing faith.

425
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:08,835
I just don't want to lose Michelle.

426
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:11,680
Then trust me.

427
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:16,596
Do you always reach out
to the McNamara/Troy patients?

428
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:19,956
I mean, offer counseling,
that sort of thing?

429
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:27,356
I've been on retainer with the company
for the past two years.

430
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:30,796
I call all the patients
during the recuperation phase,

431
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:34,708
check on depression levels,
body dysmorphia issues post-surgery,

432
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,074
that sort of thing.

433
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:39,197
Of course, based on
the personal complications in your case,

434
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:43,239
I just want to reiterate that I hope
our sessions remain confidential.

435
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:45,914
Of course. Of course.

436
00:35:58,120 --> 00:36:02,671
I didn't think you'd come by my house
again, so this time I came to you.

437
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:04,992
Leave. I don't want you near me.

438
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:08,117
But it's infected now. I need your help.

439
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:10,236
Your navel looks fine.
Put your shirt back on.

440
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:15,514
It's not my navel that's infected, Sean.
It's my nipple.

441
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:19,875
Every time Conor latches on to me,
he doesn't want to let go now.

442
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:23,475
I wouldn't have this problem if your wife
was giving him enough attention.

443
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:27,949
I told you this bitch was crazy, Sean.

444
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:30,919
Do you really think telling Julia's
gonna make her go away now?

445
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,355
Sean? Can you fix it?

446
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:38,355
I think it's time that you got rid of her
once and for all.

447
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:40,670
What do you say?

448
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:48,830
Lie down on the table.

449
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:54,190
Can I ask you something?

450
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:58,793
If we were ever to have a baby,
would you want me to breastfeed,

451
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:02,509
or would you worry that
they'd lose their shape when I got older?

452
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:04,597
Oh, and just so you know,

453
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:08,639
I'm completely open to having
a boob job after our kids are born.

454
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:12,036
If that's what you'd want.

455
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:17,272
- Do it. Slit her throat.
- No.

456
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:23,070
Okay, cut her wrists then.
Let her bleed out. It'll look like a suicide.

457
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:35,597
What do you need a scalpel for?

458
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:48,389
Sean, this is better.

459
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:52,996
Put her under,
pump her full of tranquilizer.

460
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:56,629
Then dump the body in the Everglades.
You've done it before.

461
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:58,915
I don't need surgery, do I, Sean?

462
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:10,479
Just try and relax.

463
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:15,591
Haven't...
Haven't you learned you can trust me yet?

464
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:24,193
Sean, do it. Do it and get
your marriage back, your family.

465
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:38,200
You don't need surgery, Monica.

466
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:48,832
You need psychiatric help.
Get up, get dressed, come on.

467
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:50,148
What are you talking about?

468
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:53,471
I'm going to call a psychiatrist, and
we are going to get you some real help.

469
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:57,674
You're delusional and I'm worried
you're endangering my family.

470
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:04,598
Delusional? I've been doing my job.

471
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:08,870
No, you're the one who needs help, Sean.

472
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:10,598
You took advantage of me,

473
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:12,636
you tried to take away my job,

474
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:16,315
and now you're kicking me out
of your office when I'm clearly in pain.

475
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:21,111
Maybe you'll learn your lesson after I go
to the police and tell them you raped me.

476
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:23,999
If you didn't want me
to take care of your son,

477
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:27,072
you shouldn't have screwed me
like your wife.

478
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:31,833
You better go after her, Sean. Quickly.

479
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:40,277
Monica, wait. You're being irrational.
Let's talk about this.

480
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:43,279
You should worry more about
what Julia's gonna say

481
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:46,079
when I go to the police
and tell them what you did...

482
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:58,555
I didn't see her, I swear. Is she alive?

483
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:03,197
No.

484
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:23,237
Don't worry, Sean.
She probably didn't feel a thing. It's okay.

485
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:35,955
No. No kisses. No kisses.
Only she and I did that.

486
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:46,154
Find some other way to warm her up.

487
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:10,395
All right, show me what he likes.

488
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:40,834
Okay, okay, okay. Get on with it.

489
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:06,876
Stay with me. Stay with me.

490
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:28,318
It just seems so unlike her.

491
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:32,989
I mean, I didn't even get a call back,
and I left three messages.

492
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:41,399
Monica never gave you a hint
that she was going to stand us up?

493
00:43:41,560 --> 00:43:43,312
Me? No.

494
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:46,193
I just feel so bad, you know?

495
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:50,398
You'd gone to all the trouble
to plan this second honeymoon.

496
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:53,875
We'll get another chance.

497
00:43:54,680 --> 00:43:56,716
You never know, Sean.

498
00:43:57,520 --> 00:44:02,275
You know, life is full of surprises.

499
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:05,876
Just ask Monica.

500
00:44:11,080 --> 00:44:15,995
Maybe this is all we need,
some time alone,

501
00:44:16,840 --> 00:44:19,115
a chance to reconnect.

502
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:24,275
I have really missed you, you know?

00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:31,877
Honey, what's wrong?

504
00:44:33,160 --> 00:44:37,438
Nothing. I've missed you, too.

505
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:42,473
To us.

506
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:48,232
To us.

507
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:51,598
To us.

508
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:08,552
How's it look?

509
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:12,793
Great. I think he'll like it.

510
00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:15,790
Oh, I'm sure he will.
