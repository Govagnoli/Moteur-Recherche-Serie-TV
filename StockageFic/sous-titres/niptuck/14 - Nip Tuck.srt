2
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:04,236
Tell me what you don't like about yourself.

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:05,628
You tell me.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,673
<i>Except for your eyes,
you're a 10.</i>

5
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:12,990
What do you and Matt
have in common, Adrian?

6
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:15,390
Aside from the fact
I have to share him with my mom?

7
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:17,790
You stop jeopardizing
my relationship with Matt...

8
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:19,154
or you will pay the price.

9
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:20,673
How do I make you love me again?

10
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:22,432
I will always love you.

11
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:35,556
I am so excited. Are you sure
that you don't mind doing this?

12
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:39,509
And pass up yet another
vacant night at a tired, trendy club...

13
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,990
that smells like sweat, desperation,
and Drakkar Noir?

14
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:46,037
Movie night sounds fantastic.

15
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,997
- I just don't see how it's fun for you.
- Because you'll be my eyes.

16
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,196
When you describe to me
what's happening...

17
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:55,158
we see the same thing,
we experience it together.

18
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:57,276
It's very romantic.

19
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,831
Then I'll be quite imaginative
at describing the sex scenes.

20
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:04,710
And quite willing to act out
anything that you don't understand.

21
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:13,951
Anything you're dying to rent?

22
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:18,199
<i>No Miracle Worker, no Scent of a Woman,
and no Val Kilmer movies.</i>

23
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:23,038
I'll be right back.

24
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:27,234
You can listen to the radio.
Thank you.

25
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:48,113
<i>Avoid Britney Spears in Crossroads
at all costs.</i>

26
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:51,039
It's been known to cause
spontaneous combustion.

27
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:53,271
Thanks for the tip, Nightmare.

28
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:54,998
Help you find anything?

29
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:58,875
Here's my situation. I need to find
something for my girlfriend...

30
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:02,199
- but she's blind.
- Bummer.

31
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:06,196
But in that case, I guess she hasn't
seen much, so our world opens up.

32
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,669
<i>How about All About Eve?</i>

33
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:14,156
- I'm going to be there, too.
- Right, yeah. Might be a little gay.

34
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,278
Dude, I think she's blind.

35
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,509
No way.

36
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,433
Dude, check this out.

37
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:49,954
<i>How 'bout Amélie?</i>

38
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:55,832
Okay, be a cynic.
But it made me cry, dude.

39
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,911
Man, this is a sweet ride.

40
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,079
So is Helen Keller.

41
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:04,198
Nobody deserves to have both,
you know what I'm saying?

42
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:26,549
What about this? I love Brando.

43
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:29,393
<i>Last Tango. Are you serious?</i>

44
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:31,357
Are you really ready tell your girl:

45
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:35,069
"Okay, now Marlon is shoving
a stick of butter up his girl's butt"?

46
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:53,955
How about this?

47
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,754
Can I help you?

48
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:37,434
- What the hell just happened?
- What?

49
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:41,229
The whole front end of my car is gone.
Those rims are $7,000 apiece.

50
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:45,157
Christian, oh, my God, I'm so sorry.

51
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,195
Didn't you at least feel the car move?

52
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:51,951
I thought it was the bass in the song.

53
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:44,438
Ms. Nye, tell us
what you don't like about yourself.

54
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,269
My past.

55
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:50,718
I want to forget my last 25 years.
I want to forget...

56
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:53,150
who I was and what happened to my life.

57
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,631
Ms. Nye, we're plastic surgeons.

58
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,792
We work on the surface,
not what's underneath.

59
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,629
I'm sorry. I did sort of sound like a loon
just then, didn't I?

60
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,313
<i>I'll be more specific.</i>

61
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,792
My nose was broken 16 years ago...

62
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,958
and I would like to get it fixed.

63
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:14,669
You've been living with this fracture
all this time...

64
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:16,273
and now you want it repaired?

65
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:17,954
May I ask why?

66
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:21,552
Every time I look in the mirror,
it helps me remember...

67
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:23,875
Tyler.

68
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,234
It helps me hold onto him
in some small way.

69
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:30,076
Sorry, Tyler is my son.

70
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:35,228
He's our son, Stan's and mine.
And, well, Stan was a neatnik.

71
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:38,149
And Tyler...

72
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,392
Well, Tyler was 5.

73
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:45,271
He would always play with a toy
and leave it around the kitchen floor.

74
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:48,557
<i>And no matter how many times
Stan told him to pick up his things...</i>

75
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:52,508
Tyler continued to leave things around
for one of us to trip on. Then one day...

76
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,318
Stan just snapped...

77
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,592
and he hit me because...

78
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:01,517
I didn't pick up toys, either.

79
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,319
And then he threw one at Tyler.

80
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:08,276
It hit him in the head
and it knocked him unconscious...

81
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:11,038
and he died in my arms...

82
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:15,312
from bleeding on the brain. I'm sorry.

83
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:21,837
- Was this the first time he hit you?
- No.

84
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,716
He broke my wrist.
The bones stick out a little bit right here.

85
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:29,792
You know, they really
should've put Stan away for life...

86
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:33,919
but he's getting out in a couple weeks,
and he better not come looking for me...

87
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:37,629
because I am much stronger now,
I just wouldn't take that now.

88
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:42,116
Are you wanting the surgery now
to look different so your ex-husband...

89
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:45,829
We're not officially divorced,
but I'm going to file.

90
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:49,275
So your current husband won't find you?

91
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:52,318
No, I'm doing this for me.

92
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:56,150
I've lived with this pain long enough,
and it's time to move on.

93
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:00,234
Fixing my face...

94
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:03,599
completes my breakup with this man.

95
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:07,231
I want to look forward, not back.

96
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,952
Put on your clothes.

97
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:25,557
- How about you take yours off?
- Stop it.

98
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:29,111
I said stop it! Stop humiliating yourself.

99
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:32,315
If you have a sexual urge,
masturbate.

100
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:37,873
- Where are you going?
- Taking Matt to the Shore Club.

101
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:42,158
There's $20 on the kitchen counter.
Order yourself a pizza or something.

102
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:45,434
How could you still be seeing
that little shit?

103
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,591
- I thought we...
- You thought wrong.

104
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:51,916
What happened
was a momentary weakness.

105
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,712
You're a heartless bitch!

106
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,876
Vilify me if that helps
with your separation.

107
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:05,359
You treat me like a dog.

108
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:07,795
One day you hand-feed me
scraps from the table...

109
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:10,838
and the next day you just lock me up
in the basement!

110
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:13,515
You're the goddamn Mother of the Year.

111
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:31,359
I'm so sorry.
There was terrible traffic on the causeway.

112
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,279
Honey, what's wrong?

113
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,997
Sean, I have terrible news.

114
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:40,475
I went to see Alma today, my new psychic.

115
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,717
Look. My heart line, it breaks right here.

116
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:52,316
Alma said it's nice and high,
meaning passionate, which is true...

117
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,789
but do you see where it breaks into two?

118
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,395
Yeah.

119
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:01,870
It means I'm going to have
a terrible tragedy in my love life.

120
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:05,552
It means we're not going to make it
as a couple, Sean.

121
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,709
Don't say that, Kimber.
We're having a great time, aren't we?

122
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:15,390
Will you make my love lines longer?

123
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,834
I told Alma
my boyfriend's a plastic surgeon...

124
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:22,714
and she said that if I had my heart lines
connected and extended...

125
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:26,919
then we would always be together.
That the physical can determine fate.

126
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,149
Hello, Sean.

127
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:32,913
Julia. Hi.

128
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,311
- Hello, Kimber.
- Hi.

129
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:41,679
Kevin Hotchkiss, this is Sean,
whom I'm separated from.

130
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,839
- And this is his friend, Kimber.
- How you doing?

131
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,548
Nice to meet you.

132
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:49,118
Is this your first date?

133
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:53,472
No, actually this is
our third date in three days.

134
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:56,989
Such a coincidence
that you're at this restaurant.

135
00:10:57,160 --> 00:11:01,472
No, actually, Sean brought me here
for Valentine's Day last year...

136
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:04,910
and I always wanted to come back.

137
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,513
How did the two of you meet?

138
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:11,877
I started taking zennis lessons
with Kevin last week.

139
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:14,878
- Zennis?
- Yeah, it's a Zen approach to tennis.

140
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:18,556
I've found that most players
aren't tapping into their full potential...

141
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,837
because psychologically
they're standing in their own way.

142
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:25,033
I use the physical to access the emotional.

143
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:26,629
I see.

144
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:29,189
Already, it's made such a difference
to my game.

145
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:32,989
Really. Took a set off me this morning.
Can you believe that? You did, too.

146
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:34,513
You were in the zone.

147
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:36,477
Well, have a nice meal.

148
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,751
Okay. Nice to meet you.

149
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:43,071
I'll see you in the morning
when I come to get Annie.

150
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:52,156
- I can't believe the nerve.
- I know, right?

151
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:55,439
The nerve of you
to take me to this place, Sean.

152
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:59,432
It's kind of hard for me
to enjoy a romantic night out for two...

153
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:03,229
at a place where you and your wife
shared a Valentine's Day crème brulée.

154
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:05,072
Zennis! Please.

155
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:08,750
What a crock of New Age bullshit.
And could you believe that tan?

156
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:11,559
He's a walking, talking melanoma,
if you ask me.

157
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,552
Don't be upset, baby.

158
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:29,757
I'm sure he's not as good in bed
as you are.

159
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:42,396
I'm going to make love to you
from behind.

160
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:45,632
I want you to,
but how about some foreplay first?

161
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:59,192
It's just a simple surgery.

162
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:02,631
It's just that I'd have
so much more confidence about us...

163
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:03,835
with longer love lines.

164
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,718
This operation is crazy.

165
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:08,758
I told you,
you have nothing to worry about.

166
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:20,035
But if I had the surgery...

167
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,629
then I'd know for sure
we'd always be together.

168
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,153
We don't need that.

169
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:28,631
You really should be more secure.

170
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:36,396
- Tell me you'll do it.
- Oh, Kimber.

171
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,628
Tell me...

172
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:41,953
you'll do it tomorrow.

173
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:46,358
Okay. I'll fix your hands in the morning.

174
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,195
Good morning.

175
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,956
That's a nice way to start the day.

176
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:26,516
I think I can make it even better.

177
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:45,038
I think I've figured out
how to get you under my thumb.

178
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,874
I think I want you to use all five fingers.

179
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,039
What's the matter?

180
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:04,111
Why don't you have your eyes in?

181
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:08,395
You know that I have trouble
sleeping with them in, Christian.

182
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,552
Does it turn you off?

183
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,439
It might help...

184
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:22,156
make the moment more romantic
if I could see your pretty blue eyes...

185
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:25,153
instead of the veiny vitreous.

186
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:37,919
That's interesting.

187
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:39,998
So I guess it's...

188
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:43,718
what you see and not what you feel
that turns you on.

189
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:47,114
What I see is what I feel, Natasha.

190
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,713
They can't be separated.

191
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:54,234
- I thought you appreciated my honesty.
- I do.

192
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:57,995
It's just that I don't think that way.

193
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,151
I guess I'll go put my...

194
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:05,953
eyes in, since it disturbs you so much.

195
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:20,795
Which one's the love line?
The top one.

196
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:23,269
The other two are the head line
and the life line.

197
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,429
The head line?

198
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:27,353
Yep. The one that's
supposed to say how smart you are.

199
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:30,717
Go figure.
Kimber's head line is really long.

200
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:34,192
I want to thank you for not
drawing any conclusions about this.

201
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:36,191
Don't worry about it, partner.

202
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:39,158
If anybody understands
the power of the pussy, it's me.

203
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:41,276
I'm the one
dating the blind chick...

204
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:43,556
who mistook the closet
for the bathroom last night.

205
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:46,837
Luckily I stopped her before
she ruined my Prada loafers.

206
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,356
Natasha is a bright, beautiful girl.
You could do a lot worse.

207
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,998
You have done a lot worse.

208
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:57,509
This is crazy.

209
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:00,956
I shouldn't be assuaging Kimber's
insecurities about our relationship.

210
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,678
Should be breaking up with her.

211
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:04,751
I thought things
were getting serious.

212
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:06,148
It's moving too fast.

213
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:10,070
Frankly, she's superficial.

214
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:13,830
Her spiritual guide is a palm reader.

215
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:31,831
We ran into Julia last night,
on a date with some guy.

216
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:34,475
It bothered me much more
than I thought it would.

217
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,198
She's dating someone? Who?

218
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:39,875
Her zennis coach. It's some kind
of New Age approach to tennis.

219
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:43,828
Next thing you know, she'll
have hairy armpits and smell like patchouli.

220
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:48,438
I'm trapped, Christian.
I can't break up with Kimber.

221
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,911
She's been so sweet to me.

222
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:54,875
That sugar turns to acid
when she's crossed.

223
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:57,076
<i>Remember when I tried
to break up with her?</i>

224
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:00,152
She tied me to the bed
and threatened to re-circumcise me.

225
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,072
You watch out for her, Sean.

226
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:06,438
Kimber Henry is slippery
when wet, and unstable when crossed.

227
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:34,398
Hi, Mrs. McNamara.

228
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,560
Matt told me
you were the next Anna Kournikova.

229
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,876
What are you doing here, Adrian?

230
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:44,838
I need to hit something.

231
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:53,071
I need to hit something, too.

232
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:17,869
Nice shot...

233
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,271
but I'm done playing with you.

234
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,838
Well, I guess I win, then.

235
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:31,434
Everything is a game to you, Adrian,
isn't it?

236
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:33,349
Not everything.

237
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:36,432
I need to tell you something.

238
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:39,990
What, am I going to get to my car
and see you've slashed my tires?

239
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,752
It's about me and my mom.

240
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:44,273
She broke up with me.

241
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:51,192
You can't apply a romantic convention
to a parental relationship, Adrian.

242
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:55,952
Good point. I mean, we don't have sex
with candles blazing or anything.

243
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:00,875
In fact, the last time I went down on her,
the room was pitch black.

244
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:02,678
Mom has shame issues.

245
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:10,718
What can we do for you?

246
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:13,520
Well, Trudy's nose turned out terrific.

247
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:16,194
It really did. You guys fixed it real good.

248
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:17,634
I just love it.

249
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:21,712
So I thought I could come in,
talk to you about my face.

250
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:24,590
You're considering plastic surgery?

251
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:27,832
A new chin to go with those
prison-yard biceps, perhaps.

252
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:32,033
There seems to be a lot of attitude
in this room right now.

253
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,792
I understand your reaction.

254
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:36,269
- We get it everywhere.
- But it's not what you think.

255
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:37,953
I'm not being manipulated now.

256
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:41,510
You can understand how we might
hesitate to even be in the same room...

257
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:44,194
after you said your son died
at the hand of this man.

258
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:46,629
And how those fists destroyed your face.

259
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:49,758
He's a different person now.
I was amazed, too.

260
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:51,553
And when he saw me...

261
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:56,553
he got down on his knees,
and he literally begged for forgiveness.

262
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:58,759
I really meant it.

263
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:03,634
Why are you thinking about getting
a facial reconstruction, Mr. Nye?

264
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:06,310
Trudy's forgiven me. No one else has.

265
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:09,194
We go to restaurants,
a hush falls over the place.

266
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:10,759
Managers ask us to leave.

267
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:13,718
Yes, it's a rough world out there
for child-killers.

268
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:17,031
Even worse for those children they killed
who can't eat out.

269
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:20,158
Look, I repented for what happened...

270
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:23,120
but this face still scares a lot of people...

271
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:26,158
and they won't leave us alone.
The media...

272
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,394
I get death threats.

273
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:31,074
No one recognized me
after my new nose.

274
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:34,437
It totally changed the shape of my face,
so we were thinking...

275
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:38,195
maybe you could change Stan's nose,
or maybe his cheekbones.

276
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:40,920
Maybe give me some hair plugs.
I could dye the color.

277
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:43,116
Look, I just want to start over.

278
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,719
I want a quiet, anonymous life.

279
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:50,589
I served my time.
I did my sentence like a man.

280
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:54,673
Mr. Nye, as a victim myself
of childhood abuse...

281
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:57,390
I heard the same lament from my abuser.

282
00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:00,115
The truth is, I believe you are sorry.

283
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:04,109
Sorry for yourself.
Not for Tyler, or for your wife.

284
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:08,554
Mrs. Nye, if you want to continue...

285
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:11,234
to be an accomplice
in your husband's crimes...

286
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,833
it's your business.

287
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,678
But we simply won't be.

288
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:22,269
Good afternoon.

289
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:44,552
Hi, I have an appointment
with Dr. McNamara.

290
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:47,475
I'll be taking your stitches out, Kimber.

291
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:51,635
Where's Sean?

292
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:55,071
He's at the hospital
doing a cleft palate consult on a newborn.

293
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:59,597
You can wait for him in the lobby
if you like, but it might take a while.

294
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:04,114
So, how's everything going
between you two?

295
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:07,835
Fantastic. Sean's been talking
about us moving in together.

296
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:09,829
Really?

297
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,436
Well, he's been hinting at it.
I know it's just a matter of time.

298
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:15,471
Annie and I get along so well.

299
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:19,599
I think Sean likes having
another female influence around for her.

300
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:23,718
I'm happy for you, Kimber.

301
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,839
Thank you, Christian.

302
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,719
How have you been?

303
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:33,032
You still with a different girl
every night of the week?

304
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:34,875
Hardly.

305
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:38,232
I've slowed down a lot
since I lost custody of Wilber.

306
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:40,832
But I appreciate...

307
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,798
every moment I shared with that kid...

308
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:45,871
so much more, now that he's gone.

309
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:49,353
That must be so hard.

310
00:23:56,760 --> 00:24:01,311
- So, you guys going out this weekend?
- We're going salsa dancing.

311
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:03,232
- Café Iguana?
- Yeah.

312
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:07,239
Remember when we were sweating
so much from dancing there...

313
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:10,836
that we went to the beach, took off
our clothes, and jumped in the ocean?

314
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:15,596
Then that cop came with his flashlight
and was shining it on us in the water.

315
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:22,749
You and me, we had fun together,
didn't we?

316
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:25,994
Yeah. There were some good times.

317
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:31,312
But there were some pretty bad times,
too, though.

318
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:34,719
Well, the bad times
were mostly my fault...

319
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:39,032
but when it was good, it was so easy.

320
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:45,118
Sometimes with the person
I'm currently seeing, it's...

321
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:47,268
work.

322
00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:02,669
Okay, your new and improved
longer love lines are all set.

323
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:10,316
Your hands will be tender
for a couple of days, but after that...

324
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:29,677
I've scheduled the Myers...

325
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:40,233
I guess you can't change your heart lines,
can you, Kimber?

326
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:44,279
This isn't what you think.
This means nothing. This is just sex.

327
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,477
You're the one I want, not him.

328
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:51,191
I have to share my son with you...

329
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:53,832
I won't share my girlfriend.

330
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,673
We need to talk, Sean.

331
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:25,308
No need to talk.

332
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:28,555
It worked. Thank you.

333
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:34,789
You're welcome.

334
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:39,028
Obviously, you planned on me
finding you screwing Kimber in your office.

335
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:43,916
I did think that's what you wanted.

336
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:47,909
If that was your plan all along,
it was risky, but brilliant.

337
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:55,792
She threw herself at me,
like I knew she would.

338
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:00,111
- She pulled my dick out of my pants, Sean.
- I can only imagine.

339
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:02,350
I told you she wasn't good enough for you.

340
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:05,592
Well, thank God you proved that to me
before we got any deeper.

341
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:08,991
Now, this way,
the onus of the breakup is on her.

342
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:18,479
Don't worry, I won't tell Natasha.

343
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:51,948
This is Sean.

344
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:55,314
She what?

345
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:58,031
Do we have any idea if Matt's inside?

346
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:00,839
If he's not, he should be back from school
at any moment.

347
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,673
If this revelation doesn't cause him
to run out on her...

348
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:04,875
I'm going to drag him out.

349
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:07,235
All we have to do is threaten police action.

350
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:09,914
This is so far out of bounds,
she has no defense.

351
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:13,191
Wait. Before we go in there...

352
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:16,280
I'm sorry I was cold to Kevin
the other night.

353
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,558
I'm sure he's a nice guy.

354
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:21,234
It's okay, Sean.

355
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:25,478
I just have very high standards
for who you go out with.

356
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:30,832
- You ready?
- Yeah.

357
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:47,154
Julia, Sean. What a lovely surprise.

358
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:50,437
- Here for some couples counseling?
- Enough of your bullshit, Ava.

359
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:53,353
You're not gonna infect our son
with your poison any longer.

360
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:54,589
Where is he?

361
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:56,675
Matt?

362
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,719
So George and Martha
have finally rejoined forces.

363
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:05,949
What a breakthrough.

364
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:08,793
We know what's been going on
between you and Adrian, Ava.

365
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:11,394
Adrian's my son.
What business is that of yours?

366
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:15,792
It's our business when you're sleeping
with our son and yours at the same time.

367
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:19,996
- That's disgusting.
- Adrian's told me all about it.

368
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:22,758
Adrian's told you what?

369
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:27,039
Hello, everyone.

370
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:32,031
Adrian, tell your mother and Matt
what you told Julia earlier today.

371
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:34,111
Yes, Adrian. Tell us all.

372
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:36,233
What did you tell Julia?

373
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:39,116
I told her we were having sex, Mom.

374
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:44,074
I told her you gave
the best blowjob in town.

375
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:50,918
You're disgusting, Adrian.

376
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:52,989
Very sad.

377
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:56,115
How could you say that
about your own mother?

378
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:57,349
That's sick.

379
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:59,639
He is sick, Matt.

380
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:03,430
Adrian's been on several drug therapies
since his early teens.

381
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:06,590
He's a garden-variety manic-depressive.

382
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:12,870
Clearly, Julia,
Adrian skipped a dose of his meds...

383
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:14,598
when he told you this horrible lie.

384
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:16,830
Isn't it true, Adrian?
You shut up.

385
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:21,068
You gave me those drugs to shut me up.
But I won't be silenced anymore!

386
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:25,589
I mean, Mom,
can't you see what we've done?

387
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:28,593
We've done nothing.

388
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:32,192
You need professional help, Adrian.
A sanitarium, perhaps.

389
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:33,634
The doctors I've provided...

390
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:36,189
clearly haven't made a dent
in your twisted pathology.

391
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:39,238
No! You screwed me when I was 12
and you said that you loved me!

392
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:41,789
Is this what you want,
to be a part of their sickness?

393
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:43,518
It didn't happen, Matt!

394
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:47,469
I'm sending Adrian away tomorrow
to get help.

395
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:49,392
It did happen. I swear it!

396
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:54,359
Why would I ever lie about something
so dark and so evil as incest?

397
00:30:56,720 --> 00:31:00,349
Makes you sick to your stomach
to hear that word, doesn't it, Mom?

398
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:04,672
Say it! Say it with me. Incest!

399
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:13,115
I only held you when you were
unstable and upset, to calm you down.

400
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:15,197
Mothers don't screw their sons!

401
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:21,958
You're not my son, Adrian.

402
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:36,759
You were adopted.

403
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:45,148
That's not true.

404
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:50,950
Your father and I couldn't conceive.

405
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:58,552
Wait a minute.
This is not what you told me, Ava.

406
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:02,356
I'm tired of lying to spare his feelings...

407
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:05,151
when he only has contempt for mine.

408
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:09,516
My birth parents didn't want me?

409
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:18,309
Why not?

410
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:24,550
Why not?

411
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:31,474
The doctors said
you were mentally damaged.

412
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:35,076
A diagnosis that's proven correct.

413
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:53,669
I'm sorry I didn't tell you earlier, Matt.

414
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:02,435
Come on, Matt. Let's go home.

415
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:43,549
Christian?

416
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:46,109
In here.

417
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:47,795
In here where?

418
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:50,629
I'm in here.

419
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:53,919
Guess what?

420
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:59,278
We got word the test marketing
on my new fragrance was sky-high.

421
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:03,635
A keen sense of smell does come in handy.

422
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:13,515
What's wrong?

423
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:16,275
Nothing.

424
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:20,073
Am I a little rank?

425
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:24,635
No.

426
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:27,515
But she is.

427
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:31,794
Vaginal secretions are quite pungent.

428
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:34,233
You must know that.

429
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:39,474
Why didn't you try to shower off
the evidence?

430
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:45,997
Because I wanted you to know.

431
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:55,832
And her name is?

432
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:00,875
Kimber Henry.

433
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:06,590
She was Sean's girlfriend,
and before that, she was mine.

434
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:07,715
<i>It happened in my office.</i>

435
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:09,996
I was taking her stitches out
after an operation.

436
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:14,633
So it was an impulse interaction.

437
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:20,239
Well, I appreciate
your honesty...

438
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:26,198
but it's going to be okay,
because I know that you don't love her.

439
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:30,348
- Christ.
- I'm sorry.

440
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:33,114
The sorrys aren't enough.
I'm going to start billing you.

441
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:36,397
- Okay, why are you being such a prick?
- What, you're just noticing?

442
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:37,913
This is me, sweetheart.

443
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:40,435
I stink of stray pussy,
I don't like movie nights...

444
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:42,477
and I think about banging every girl I see.

445
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:46,076
You are very generous of heart.
You've been wonderful with me.

446
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:47,719
I cheated on you!

447
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:52,231
I keep putting myself in situations
where I should be broken up with...

448
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:53,469
but nobody cuts me loose.

449
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:55,995
Because we see the good
fighting the dark.

450
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:58,192
Because you're worth fighting for.

451
00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:00,999
Just shut up
with your poetic largesse, okay?

452
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:08,590
I can't take the guilt any longer.
You're too good to me.

453
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:11,433
Not to mention your incredible
handicap, which if I had...

454
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:14,592
I would've thrown myself
out the window in 10 seconds.

455
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:18,033
I can't take the heroics,
and the goodness, and...

456
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:34,478
I can't do this anymore.

457
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:37,275
It's strangling me. You're strangling me.

458
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:40,878
Your handicapped ramps...

459
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:44,671
and your superhuman sense
of freaky smell...

460
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:47,479
- and your scary eyes.
- Okay, stop it, Christian.

461
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:54,713
You're a hassle, okay, Natasha?

462
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:01,949
And I slept with Kimber today...

463
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:04,789
because she is fun and breezy...

464
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:08,191
and I don't have to hold her hand
when we cross the street.

465
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:14,799
So I'm not asking...

466
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:16,509
I'm telling.

467
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:22,115
The best thing for both of us
is if you walk out that door right now...

468
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:23,679
and never come back.

469
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:31,518
You're better than this.
No, sweetheart...

470
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:32,829
you are.

471
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:38,075
And I'm tired of being reminded of it.

472
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:44,469
Goodbye.

473
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:36,754
It's rude not to return a dozen phone calls.

474
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:39,078
I don't want to talk to you, Ava.

475
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:41,754
Just let me get my stuff
and get out of here.

476
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:49,279
Adrian's run away.

477
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:52,555
Good for him.

478
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:54,839
I'm worried about him.

479
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:58,114
He's unstable. He could hurt himself.

480
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:03,950
I'm worried he might want to hurt you.

481
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:05,753
I can defend myself.

482
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:13,155
You can stop acting, Matt.
I'm not your parents.

483
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:15,436
I don't expect an image.

484
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:19,037
I've seen the real soul inside.

485
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:24,474
And I know you miss me
as much as I miss you.

486
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:26,635
Don't.

487
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:34,030
You lied to me about Adrian.

488
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:38,955
I was trying to protect him
from a truth he clearly couldn't accept.

489
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:42,838
Did you sleep with him?

490
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:47,435
The only man I've been with
since I met you...

491
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:49,230
is you.

492
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,116
Why should I ever believe you again?

493
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:58,589
Because...

494
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:02,069
even with all that I risk by doing it...

495
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:05,793
I love you, and only you.

496
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:09,158
Everything else falls away.

497
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:52,198
It's not what you think.

498
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:54,519
Stan wasn't even home.

499
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:57,513
He went down to the corner
to pick up some dinner.

500
00:40:57,680 --> 00:40:58,999
Our freezer was on the fritz...

501
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:01,515
and there was water
all over the kitchen floor.

502
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:03,631
It was stupid. I knew it was there...

503
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:07,395
and I slipped on it anyway,
and hit my nose on the corner of the table.

504
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:09,312
Why didn't he come with you?

505
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:13,277
He would've,
but he had to be at his parole officer's.

506
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:17,836
Trudy, if Stan hit you again,
which he obviously did, you can tell us.

507
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,753
We'll call DHS and they'll put you
in a safe space tonight.

508
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:22,672
I'm telling you, he didn't do it!

509
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:25,274
It was my stupidity, and that is all.

510
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:29,479
Stan loves me, and I love Stan.
And we need each other.

511
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:33,269
What we don't need
is anyone telling us how to live our lives.

512
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:41,396
So can you please fix my nose?

513
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,150
Because I'm having trouble breathing.

514
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:51,990
We do have an opening this afternoon.

515
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:55,714
<i>We could do the operation today
if you'd like.</i>

516
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:01,279
I was wondering...

517
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:04,990
do you have to put me under anesthesia,
like you did last time?

518
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:06,309
Why do you ask?

519
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:08,315
I'm pregnant.

520
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:11,197
I don't want to hurt my baby.

521
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:31,237
It's sad, isn't it?
After all that's happened...

522
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:35,109
Stan Nye's power over Trudy
is still too strong for her to escape.

523
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:38,352
I don't see a
"happily ever after" in their future.

524
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:05,397
So, I guess we're just
two available bachelors now.

525
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:06,995
I guess.

526
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:09,958
What do you say
we grab a few beers...

527
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:12,114
get some steaks...

528
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:15,233
and have a rip-roaring
guys-on-the-town night?

529
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:19,190
I can't. I got plans.

530
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:23,355
Wow. A new girl already?

531
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:25,797
That's impressive, even for you.

532
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:28,829
When did you have time
to even meet her?

533
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:31,675
I'm having dinner
with Kimber tonight.

534
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:39,191
Why are you going out with her?

535
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:47,199
Know what? You're right.

536
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:49,669
I shouldn't
just use her sexually. You should.

537
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:53,549
I'll cancel, and then you can
play hide the pickle with her tonight.

538
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:55,759
I don't want that.

539
00:43:57,080 --> 00:43:58,638
I'm relieved it's over.

540
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:00,115
Let's be honest.

541
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:02,350
Only reason
she jumped in the sack with me...

542
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:03,953
is because of my proximity to you.

543
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:05,917
She can't be trusted.
No.

544
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:10,949
You don't belong with Kimber
anyway, Sean.

545
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:13,550
You belong
with someone like Julia.

546
00:44:13,720 --> 00:44:17,315
Yeah, well,
Julia is not available any longer.

547
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:55,790
