1
00:00:18,328 --> 00:00:19,415
She's in the bedroom.

2
00:00:22,331 --> 00:00:23,168
Watch your step.

3
00:00:29,488 --> 00:00:32,503
I'd introduce you two, but I believe you've already met.

4
00:00:32,897 --> 00:00:36,220
The carvings on the face are almost identical to the first attack.

5
00:00:37,254 --> 00:00:39,799
Identical except for 2 things.

6
00:00:40,541 --> 00:00:42,913
He's never come back for one of his victims,

7
00:00:43,003 --> 00:00:44,586
and he's never killed.

8
00:00:47,752 --> 00:00:50,510
Raping and carving isn't enough for him anymore.

9
00:00:52,744 --> 00:00:55,732
He's crossed the line. Lost control.

10
00:00:56,035 --> 00:00:58,169
That's when you start to make mistakes, isn't it?

11
00:01:07,156 --> 00:01:08,174
And there it is.

12
00:01:14,803 --> 00:01:18,050
Tell me what you don't like about yourself, Mr. Montejo.

13
00:01:18,132 --> 00:01:22,932
Montejo? My name is Trapp. Granville Trapp?

14
00:01:24,133 --> 00:01:26,320
I'm sorry. I must have grabbed the wrong file this morning.

15
00:01:26,391 --> 00:01:30,267
It's ok. People are always mistaking me for someone else these days.

16
00:01:30,324 --> 00:01:33,483
My own mother says she barely recognizes me anymore.

17
00:01:34,015 --> 00:01:37,165
Look at this mug, huh? It's a halloween mask.

18
00:01:37,181 --> 00:01:39,771
You're referring to the hollowness around your cheeks?

19
00:01:39,807 --> 00:01:42,444
I'm referring to my aids face.

20
00:01:42,894 --> 00:01:44,531
I'm HIV-positive.

21
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:47,331
The cocktail I'm on right now is what's doing this.

22
00:01:47,394 --> 00:01:51,771
Not that I'm complaining that much. I'm still alive, which is more than I can say for John.

23
00:01:52,662 --> 00:01:55,315
He was my partner for 5 years.

24
00:01:56,488 --> 00:01:59,057
And was he on a treatment plan as well?

25
00:01:59,156 --> 00:02:01,130
Mr. Homopathic?

26
00:02:01,357 --> 00:02:03,159
He wouldn't take ibuprofen.

27
00:02:03,228 --> 00:02:07,147
We tried licorice, cat's claw -- anything to boost his immune system.

28
00:02:07,223 --> 00:02:10,706
I cashed in my 401K for these meds and, well...

29
00:02:10,988 --> 00:02:13,603
he didn'td last a year after he was diagnosed.

30
00:02:14,069 --> 00:02:15,406
I'm very sorry.

31
00:02:16,425 --> 00:02:17,454
I'm not.

32
00:02:17,889 --> 00:02:21,786
Asshole was screwing around on me almost from the beginning.

33
00:02:21,822 --> 00:02:24,478
He used to meet men online and set up anonymous meetings for sex

34
00:02:24,535 --> 00:02:26,756
the whole time we were together. I never knew.

35
00:02:28,114 --> 00:02:33,499
It's scary. To get that close to someone, to know every detail of their life, to dress them...

36
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:36,976
I never imagined I would be deceived like that.

37
00:02:39,055 --> 00:02:42,921
Technically, the term for your condition is facial lipoatrophy.

38
00:02:42,982 --> 00:02:46,228
I'm guessing you're on a high dosage of zerit or retrovir?

39
00:02:47,301 --> 00:02:50,637
Over time, the reaction from those chemicals is that

40
00:02:50,699 --> 00:02:55,895
it will eat away the fat cells in the face, arms, legs, mid-section.

41
00:02:55,912 --> 00:03:01,103
Whatever you call it, it is my scarlet letter that screams, "sick gay man. Stay away."

42
00:03:01,609 --> 00:03:03,663
I just want to start dating again.

43
00:03:03,689 --> 00:03:04,739
Dating?

44
00:03:04,801 --> 00:03:07,051
I'm not dead. I'm just lonely.

45
00:03:08,633 --> 00:03:10,211
I want my old face back.

46
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:16,785
When did you get to be such an expert on aids medication?

47
00:03:16,868 --> 00:03:18,956
I buy Gina's supply every month.

48
00:03:19,058 --> 00:03:20,246
I never knew that.

49
00:03:21,009 --> 00:03:23,384
There's a lot of things you don't know about me, Sean.

50
00:03:28,198 --> 00:03:29,401
Miss McGraw.

51
00:03:29,852 --> 00:03:31,797
To what do we owe this displeasure?

52
00:03:31,899 --> 00:03:33,348
Step away from the counter, Christian.

53
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:36,251
Oh, we don't play those kinds of games anymore, sweetheart.

54
00:03:40,004 --> 00:03:41,187
What are you doing here?

55
00:03:41,294 --> 00:03:44,203
Step away from the counter and put your hands behind your head.

56
00:03:44,249 --> 00:03:45,288
Now!

57
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,259
Hey. Hold on a second.

58
00:03:47,341 --> 00:03:48,176
What the hell's going on?

59
00:03:48,202 --> 00:03:51,253
Christian Troy, you are under arrest or the murder of Rhea Reynolds.

60
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:53,368
You have the right to remain silent.

61
00:04:49,345 --> 00:04:52,038
The most important thing is to not let word of this get out.

62
00:04:52,099 --> 00:04:54,705
To anyone. The press gets wind of his arrest,

63
00:04:54,803 --> 00:04:56,785
business will suffer. Agreed?

64
00:04:56,846 --> 00:04:59,836
Sure. Fine. Everything's back to normal then.

65
00:05:00,912 --> 00:05:02,981
How can you be so blithe, Sean?

66
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:07,480
Look, the cops can't arrest anyone for a crime like this

67
00:05:07,527 --> 00:05:09,671
unless they have serious evidence, right?

68
00:05:09,712 --> 00:05:12,985
I'd be willing to bet Kit had Christian arrested just to get back at him.

69
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:15,985
Do you think she'd actually go that far just because she was dumped?

70
00:05:16,056 --> 00:05:17,704
That bitch? Hell yeah.

71
00:05:18,253 --> 00:05:21,397
Liz, you don't really think Christian is the carver, do you?

72
00:05:23,824 --> 00:05:26,814
People who knew Ted Bundy thought he was a hell of a guy.

73
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:31,928
He was college educated, very charming, good with the ladies.

74
00:05:32,143 --> 00:05:35,451
And then you find out he strangled them after biting their nipples off.

75
00:05:37,029 --> 00:05:41,001
Being charming and screwing a lot of women does not make you a serial killer.

76
00:05:41,052 --> 00:05:44,155
I know, Sean. I am just playing devil's advocate.

77
00:05:44,207 --> 00:05:46,287
I've known Christian for 20 years.

78
00:05:46,347 --> 00:05:49,188
For the better part of that time we've spent 14 hours a day together.

79
00:05:49,244 --> 00:05:51,682
I could tell you almost every detail of his life,

80
00:05:51,738 --> 00:05:55,578
from how many cavities he has to what he keeps in his sock drawer.

81
00:05:55,645 --> 00:05:57,566
I know him like he's a part of me.

82
00:05:57,622 --> 00:06:00,934
And I know there's no way in hell he did what he's being accused of.

83
00:06:01,088 --> 00:06:06,330
You knew him for 20 years, and you never would have imagined he was Matt's father, either.

84
00:06:19,869 --> 00:06:22,326
You know what we call the ones who fall asleep in here?

85
00:06:23,775 --> 00:06:24,686
Guilty.

86
00:06:26,274 --> 00:06:29,391
You see, an innocent man, he's terrified at this point.

87
00:06:29,770 --> 00:06:33,349
He's thinking that maybe he'll never see his family and friends again.

88
00:06:33,508 --> 00:06:35,843
He's thinking that maybe he'll get raped in prison.

89
00:06:35,924 --> 00:06:40,261
An innocent man won't sleep because he's too anxious.

90
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:44,696
A guilty man, he figures he's been caught.

91
00:06:44,946 --> 00:06:47,388
He can finally stop running and get some sleep.

92
00:06:47,426 --> 00:06:50,506
14 hour in this place without even a cup of coffee,

93
00:06:50,568 --> 00:06:52,882
and Gandhi would become a narcoleptic.

94
00:06:52,954 --> 00:06:55,657
Can I offer you something to drink, then? We might be here a while.

95
00:06:56,552 --> 00:06:58,047
I don't think so.

96
00:06:58,570 --> 00:07:01,494
You proved your point. You're pissed you got dumped. I get it.

97
00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:03,008
But I'm done playing.

98
00:07:04,970 --> 00:07:08,805
If I'm not home by 10:00 and deep into a beer and some chinese food,

99
00:07:08,867 --> 00:07:12,589
I'll have my lawyer sue you for defamation of character, false arrest

100
00:07:12,641 --> 00:07:15,268
and, if possible, being a royal bitch.

101
00:07:16,455 --> 00:07:18,538
You're under arrest for murder, Christian.

102
00:07:19,389 --> 00:07:20,848
This isn't a game.

103
00:07:21,344 --> 00:07:26,035
If you're so sure that I'm the carver, what's there to talk about? Hmm?

104
00:07:26,125 --> 00:07:27,724
You just want to torture me.

105
00:07:27,785 --> 00:07:29,219
Actually, I'm here to help you.

106
00:07:29,290 --> 00:07:30,024
Help me?

107
00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:31,232
With your confession.

108
00:07:31,502 --> 00:07:32,174
Oh.

109
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:35,332
Give it to me, and I'll work with the D.A. to waive the death penalty.

110
00:07:35,931 --> 00:07:37,801
You've hurt enough people, Christian.

111
00:07:38,738 --> 00:07:41,328
Spare the ones you love and confess your crimes.

112
00:07:41,799 --> 00:07:43,709
What the hell are you talking about?

113
00:07:43,791 --> 00:07:47,139
Kimber and I had a nice chat several hours ago.

114
00:07:50,385 --> 00:07:54,236
You're wasting my time. I'm not answering your questions, Kit.

115
00:07:54,583 --> 00:07:56,748
After all the intimacy we've shared?

116
00:07:57,225 --> 00:07:59,432
What do you have to hide from me now, Kimber?

117
00:07:59,561 --> 00:08:02,648
Of course, I should remind you that anything you say in here is on the record.

118
00:08:02,659 --> 00:08:05,412
Lying would only implicate you in Christian's crimes.

119
00:08:05,494 --> 00:08:10,558
Christian isn't a murderer. You know that. This is all entrapment.

120
00:08:10,619 --> 00:08:11,854
You mean because we slept together?

121
00:08:11,910 --> 00:08:14,669
Sweetheart, I hate to break it to you, but I was undercover.

122
00:08:15,862 --> 00:08:17,880
We're some sort of assignment to you?

123
00:08:20,113 --> 00:08:22,288
You really are a sick, twisted person.

124
00:08:22,350 --> 00:08:24,695
The truth is, if you want to catch a deviant killer,

125
00:08:24,761 --> 00:08:27,096
you have to get close enough to watch him work.

126
00:08:27,178 --> 00:08:28,791
As I recall, you're the deviant one.

127
00:08:28,857 --> 00:08:32,154
Interesting judgment, coming from someone who makes her living as a whore.

128
00:08:32,215 --> 00:08:35,535
All that sex desensitizes you after a while, doesn't it?

129
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:38,607
You start needing more and more kinkiness to get off.

130
00:08:38,682 --> 00:08:42,215
Bondage, role playing, masochistic behavior.

131
00:08:42,286 --> 00:08:43,839
Anything to keep upping the ante.

132
00:08:43,891 --> 00:08:48,324
In fact, maybe you and Christian are another Paul and Karla Bernardo.

133
00:08:48,998 --> 00:08:49,828
Who?

134
00:08:49,890 --> 00:08:52,283
Married couple from Canada, back in the nineties.

135
00:08:52,358 --> 00:08:55,343
Liked to kidnap and drug women, bring them back to their home.

136
00:08:55,401 --> 00:09:00,192
Before they killed them, Karla would videotape her husband raping the unconscious bodies.

137
00:09:00,366 --> 00:09:04,284
You can't dispute the fact that as a director, you know your way around a camera.

138
00:09:04,661 --> 00:09:06,295
You think I'm a killer?

139
00:09:07,078 --> 00:09:10,206
Why don't you admit why you really brought me down here, Kit?

140
00:09:10,268 --> 00:09:12,973
You're jealous of me. You fell in love with Christian,

141
00:09:13,048 --> 00:09:16,842
and now that it's just me and him, you're trying to get your revenge.

142
00:09:16,904 --> 00:09:20,555
Once you screw a girl's lover in front of her, there's no need to get revenge, is there?

143
00:09:24,497 --> 00:09:27,123
Then again, assaulting an officer is grounds for arrest.

144
00:09:27,222 --> 00:09:30,974
Oh, you're kidding. You're arresting me? You're not arresting me!

145
00:09:31,056 --> 00:09:32,198
Are you crazy?

146
00:09:34,414 --> 00:09:38,552
You have no right to treat her like that. She didn't hurt you.

147
00:09:39,066 --> 00:09:43,186
That's sweet. You're acting like a real person who's capable of loving someone.

148
00:09:43,569 --> 00:09:46,288
I do... love her.

149
00:09:47,276 --> 00:09:49,571
Look what you've done to her since you've met her.

150
00:09:49,657 --> 00:09:54,081
Cocaine addict, porn star. Now arrested for assaulting an officer.

151
00:09:54,306 --> 00:09:57,644
Has there ever been anything you've touched that you didn't destroy?

152
00:09:59,437 --> 00:10:03,000
You better wise up and start cooperating with me, Christian,

153
00:10:03,255 --> 00:10:05,282
or Kimber is only the beginning.

154
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:08,713
Once word of your arrest gets out, and people realize who you really are,

155
00:10:08,735 --> 00:10:11,115
I might be the only friend you have left.

156
00:10:20,398 --> 00:10:22,599
Did they set any kind of bail?

157
00:10:24,888 --> 00:10:29,168
This is gonna cost Christian everything he has if it goes to trial, isn't it?

158
00:10:29,210 --> 00:10:31,093
It won't go to trial. He didn't do anything.

159
00:10:31,211 --> 00:10:36,065
I know he didn't. But people get railroaded by the justice system all the time.

160
00:10:36,142 --> 00:10:41,549
I mean, even if he's found innocent, the damage it could do to his career, just to be accused.

161
00:10:42,326 --> 00:10:44,457
Would you still stay in business with him?

162
00:10:44,489 --> 00:10:45,614
Are you serious?

163
00:10:45,814 --> 00:10:48,599
Of course I would. Absolutely.

164
00:10:48,671 --> 00:10:53,489
Even if it cost you the practice? Everything you've worked for you whole life?

165
00:10:53,505 --> 00:10:58,430
He's innocent, Julia. If I have to, I'll help pay his legal fees myself.

166
00:11:12,368 --> 00:11:15,470
How could I be the carver if I was carved myself?


167
00:11:18,998 --> 00:11:21,470
You had all the right tools to begin with.

168
00:11:23,186 --> 00:11:25,709
First you gave yourself a trace amount of the tranquilizer--

169
00:11:25,781 --> 00:11:28,843
just enough to pass scrutiny and investigation.

170
00:11:33,442 --> 00:11:35,829
As a surgeon, you'd know exactly where to carve yourself,

171
00:11:35,850 --> 00:11:38,172
so you'd never be in any real danger.

172
00:11:39,174 --> 00:11:42,041
Then you hid all your tools and jumped into bed.

173
00:11:44,809 --> 00:11:46,957
After you let yourself bleed a while, you called the police.

174
00:11:47,008 --> 00:11:49,543
A brilliant misdirection, I must admit.

175
00:11:56,583 --> 00:11:58,472
What about the fact that I was raped?

176
00:11:59,471 --> 00:12:00,704
How could I fake that?

177
00:12:02,471 --> 00:12:05,297
You refused a police examination.

178
00:12:06,844 --> 00:12:10,029
There's no proof of any assault or penetration.

179
00:12:10,202 --> 00:12:12,220
You don't have a single hard fact.

180
00:12:12,308 --> 00:12:14,672
You want me or anyone else to believe that you have a case?

181
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:18,163
I think you need something a little more solid than a breakdown from my girlfriend

182
00:12:18,215 --> 00:12:21,333
and some far-flung theory about how I faked my own carving.

183
00:12:26,706 --> 00:12:28,076
Maybe this will help.

184
00:12:31,564 --> 00:12:33,242
Your size, I believe.

185
00:12:33,585 --> 00:12:36,064
Found in Rhea's apartment after the murder.

186
00:12:37,041 --> 00:12:39,744
Blood on the outside of the condom matches Rhea's.

187
00:12:40,396 --> 00:12:43,140
Semen on the inside matches yours.

188
00:12:44,281 --> 00:12:46,001
That solid enough for you?

189
00:12:58,281 --> 00:13:00,001
I can explain the condom.

190
00:13:00,711 --> 00:13:01,971
You planted it.

191
00:13:02,104 --> 00:13:03,119
That's your defense?

192
00:13:03,136 --> 00:13:06,108
Given all the used magnums I've used with you over the last 3 months,

193
00:13:06,159 --> 00:13:09,846
it would be easy for you to steal one and leave it in Rhea's bed.

194
00:13:11,208 --> 00:13:15,243
Let's see. I snuck into Rhea's apartment after she was murdered,

195
00:13:15,289 --> 00:13:18,473
but before the police showed up, and hid one of your used condoms

196
00:13:18,514 --> 00:13:21,406
that I stole from your trash can a week ago?

197
00:13:21,571 --> 00:13:26,158
I'm never adverse to a good conspiracy theory, Christian, but even that one's a little thin.

198
00:13:26,281 --> 00:13:28,241
If you didn't plant it, somebody did.

199
00:13:28,304 --> 00:13:29,164
Who would do that?

200
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:32,687
Throw a stone down south beach. You'll hit some model I screwed and never called back.

201
00:13:32,742 --> 00:13:33,863
Why don't you start there?

202
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:36,471
I'd rather look at something no one knows about.

203
00:13:36,665 --> 00:13:39,937
You were in reform school as a child. Is that right?

204
00:13:43,936 --> 00:13:46,479
When I was 12. What's that got to do with anything?

205
00:13:46,517 --> 00:13:50,397
Quite a lot, actually, when you consider what landed you there in the first place.

206
00:13:50,416 --> 00:13:53,736
I found a lot of fascinating newspaper articles from back then.

207
00:13:56,207 --> 00:13:59,336
Seems that you were quite the carver, even at an early age.

208
00:14:13,837 --> 00:14:18,075
Animal killing in children is one of the earliest signs ofd sociopathic behavior.

209
00:14:19,105 --> 00:14:22,075
Almost all serial killers start out that way.

210
00:14:29,427 --> 00:14:31,627
I didn't kill these animals.

211
00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:34,705
I found them that way. They were already dead.

212
00:14:34,718 --> 00:14:36,498
You just cut off their head as an experiment.

213
00:14:36,559 --> 00:14:38,209
What can I say? I've always wanted to be a surgeon.

214
00:14:38,275 --> 00:14:40,768
You mean you were exercising that god complex of yours.

215
00:14:40,829 --> 00:14:44,311
It's not a god complex. I was a kid. I was bored. Curious.

216
00:14:44,338 --> 00:14:47,546
That's funny. That's what Matt said the other day about why he picked up a transsexual.

217
00:14:47,572 --> 00:14:48,842
He was curious.

218
00:14:48,913 --> 00:14:52,488
Don't start comparing my childhood to what's going on with Matt.

219
00:14:52,569 --> 00:14:54,960
We grew up under very different circumstances.

220
00:14:55,007 --> 00:14:58,468
Yes, but that's what makes it so fascinating. That despite the different upbringings,

221
00:14:58,484 --> 00:15:02,706
your genes have produced a child that's proven to be as violent as yourself.

222
00:15:02,738 --> 00:15:05,528
Nature beats nurture every time.

223
00:15:05,626 --> 00:15:08,493
Your prosecutorial arguments will not stand up in court.

224
00:15:08,519 --> 00:15:13,485
Oh, I think they will once I prove beyond reasonable doubt that your violence is innate.

225
00:15:14,882 --> 00:15:16,051
Let's take a walk.

226
00:15:16,889 --> 00:15:18,191
You have visitors.

227
00:15:28,834 --> 00:15:31,174
Oh, my god. Christian.

228
00:15:33,305 --> 00:15:34,360
I'm ok.

229
00:15:40,047 --> 00:15:41,491
How have they been treating you?

230
00:15:41,518 --> 00:15:42,699
Like a criminal.

231
00:15:43,795 --> 00:15:47,676
Being lockedd alone in a room with that bitch for 2 hours, now I am ready to kill somebody.

232
00:15:47,737 --> 00:15:49,900
She's got a serious case from what I hear.

233
00:15:49,975 --> 00:15:51,434
What do you mean, from what you hear?

234
00:15:51,530 --> 00:15:54,670
They found one of your condoms at the site, right?

235
00:15:56,836 --> 00:15:57,921
Is that true?

236
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:01,439
You don't actually believe I could...

237
00:16:07,648 --> 00:16:10,849
She planted it, Sean. How else do you think it got there?

238
00:16:10,978 --> 00:16:13,245
She also told us that you haven't asked for a lawyer.

239
00:16:13,313 --> 00:16:15,472
I haven't done anything. I don't need one.

240
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:23,609
I asking for representation is tantamount to saying that I've got something to hide. I don't.

241
00:16:32,202 --> 00:16:34,981
I can't believe this is happening to me.

242
00:16:42,524 --> 00:16:44,406
We've hired a lawyer for you.

243
00:16:45,093 --> 00:16:47,013
Cunningham's the best in the city.

244
00:16:47,161 --> 00:16:48,073
He's on his way.

245
00:16:49,395 --> 00:16:50,141
Thank you.

246
00:16:50,204 --> 00:16:52,737
It's not because we doubt you, Christian.

247
00:16:52,830 --> 00:16:56,122
It's just because we want to make sure you're protected, that's all.

248
00:16:56,302 --> 00:16:57,959
You want to protect me?

249
00:16:58,071 --> 00:16:59,439
Then go to my condo.

250
00:16:59,531 --> 00:17:03,182
Kit's getting a search warrant and tearing the place apart tomorrow.

251
00:17:03,570 --> 00:17:05,061
What do you want us to do?

252
00:17:08,788 --> 00:17:13,912
I need somebody I trust to be there so she doesn't plant any more evidence.

253
00:17:14,032 --> 00:17:15,773
She knows she's not gonna get a confession,

254
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:19,279
so she's trying to turn everybody I know against me.

255
00:17:29,644 --> 00:17:31,721
Yeah. Maybe a little more on the right cheek.

256
00:17:31,756 --> 00:17:35,802
Another 3 ccs under there, he'll look exactly like his old, healthy self.

257
00:17:36,432 --> 00:17:37,768
This isn't right.

258
00:17:37,915 --> 00:17:40,584
Ok, then we start with a smaller dose. We'll wait to see how it settles--

259
00:17:40,651 --> 00:17:44,081
This man is sick. Why are we hiding his disease?

260
00:17:44,256 --> 00:17:46,584
If we make him look like a normal, healthy guy,

261
00:17:46,646 --> 00:17:50,041
he could sleep with anyone he wants and spread the virus undetected now.

262
00:17:50,087 --> 00:17:52,038
That's dangerous and irresponsible.

263
00:17:52,124 --> 00:17:54,469
Are you assuming he's gonna just run out of here when we're done

264
00:17:54,530 --> 00:17:56,467
and bang everyone he sees just to infect them?

265
00:17:56,527 --> 00:17:59,123
I only spent 10 minutes in a consultation with him.

266
00:17:59,194 --> 00:18:00,624
I don't know him at all.

267
00:18:00,701 --> 00:18:03,906
I think Christian's arrest has gotten you a little paranoid, my friend.

268
00:18:06,944 --> 00:18:10,347
You know they found a condom at the crime scene that matches Christian's DNA.

269
00:18:10,402 --> 00:18:13,414
So what? The police planted it. It happens all the time.

270
00:18:13,456 --> 00:18:15,087
DNA doesn't lie.

271
00:18:15,164 --> 00:18:17,725
Ask OJ. He'll tell you otherwise.

272
00:18:21,877 --> 00:18:23,284
You think Christian did it.

273
00:18:23,307 --> 00:18:25,834
I didn't say that. It's not what I think.

274
00:18:29,562 --> 00:18:31,308
You've only known him a few months.

275
00:18:31,369 --> 00:18:33,572
I'd say you'd be more susceptible to believing he's guilty.

276
00:18:33,603 --> 00:18:35,404
I think it's the opposite, really.

277
00:18:35,531 --> 00:18:37,713
I think you know more about someone in the first 5 minutes

278
00:18:37,754 --> 00:18:41,308
than you do in an entire 20-year relationship. Think about it.

279
00:18:41,447 --> 00:18:43,602
Those first gut instincts, they're always right.

280
00:18:43,697 --> 00:18:47,088
It's time and sentimentality that cloud the mind's ability to judge.

281
00:19:00,068 --> 00:19:04,558
I've taken the liberty of filling in a lot of details already on this crime report,

282
00:19:04,614 --> 00:19:07,599
dates of the attacks, victim's names, et cetera.

283
00:19:07,665 --> 00:19:10,503
All you need to do is sign here for now,

284
00:19:10,682 --> 00:19:14,005
and we can work on the language of your confession after you get some rest.

285
00:19:14,067 --> 00:19:17,651
I'm sure you'll agree that given all the evidence, this is your best way out.

286
00:19:19,472 --> 00:19:20,548
Screw you.

287
00:19:21,433 --> 00:19:22,807
I want my lawyer.

288
00:19:23,036 --> 00:19:26,090
You bring a lawyer into this, and I won't be able to help you anymore, Christian.

289
00:19:26,144 --> 00:19:27,941
My deal is off the table.

290
00:19:28,019 --> 00:19:31,786
You wanna play hardball, sweetheart? You have no idea who you're dealing with.

291
00:19:36,389 --> 00:19:37,747
I'm sorry to hear that.

292
00:19:38,565 --> 00:19:40,126
I'll get your lawyer, then.

293
00:19:40,326 --> 00:19:41,492
He's been waiting.

294
00:19:43,011 --> 00:19:46,711
Oh! If you don't mind, let me give you some advice.

295
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:48,837
Tell him you want to plead insanity.

296
00:19:48,899 --> 00:19:51,078
What, for sleeping with you in the first place?

297
00:19:51,155 --> 00:19:53,429
Given your family lineage, I think you have a good chance

298
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:55,548
to at least avoid the death penalty.

299
00:19:55,605 --> 00:19:57,586
A jury might even have sympathy for you.

300
00:19:57,648 --> 00:19:59,102
What do you know about my lineage?

301
00:19:59,168 --> 00:20:03,510
You have a genetic predisposition to violence, Christian. It's in your blood.

302
00:20:03,572 --> 00:20:04,780
What are you talking about?

303
00:20:04,857 --> 00:20:07,032
I found your birth mother, Christian.

304
00:20:08,804 --> 00:20:10,109
She's still alive.

305
00:20:19,767 --> 00:20:21,917
Your adoption records had been sealed by the court

306
00:20:21,968 --> 00:20:24,236
because she was only 15 when you were born.

307
00:20:24,314 --> 00:20:28,685
I had them subpoenaed as part of your investigation, then tracked her down from there.

308
00:20:29,903 --> 00:20:33,099
It turns out your mother lived only a hundred miles from Miami.

309
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:35,608
All this time?

310
00:20:36,748 --> 00:20:40,011
When I contacted her, she insisted on coming down personally.

311
00:20:41,367 --> 00:20:43,139
Normally, I'd never let a suspect do this, but

312
00:20:43,175 --> 00:20:46,113
I have a soft heart when it comes to family reunions.

313
00:20:47,578 --> 00:20:49,298
You have 5 minutes.

314
00:21:17,078 --> 00:21:18,140
Hello, Christian.

315
00:21:22,016 --> 00:21:23,936
They always told me you were dead.

316
00:21:26,651 --> 00:21:30,259
I'm sorry. This must be quite a shock for you, then.

317
00:22:01,185 --> 00:22:03,795
Detective McGraw has filled me in

318
00:22:03,846 --> 00:22:06,182
on most of the details of what's happening for you--

319
00:22:06,238 --> 00:22:09,688
Detective McGraw has the wrong man in custody. She knows that.

320
00:22:10,486 --> 00:22:13,288
Well, I suppose there's one thing you can't deny,

321
00:22:13,447 --> 00:22:16,482
and that is that you look a lot like your father.

322
00:22:18,459 --> 00:22:20,348
Is he still alive, my father?

323
00:22:20,765 --> 00:22:22,027
I don't know,

324
00:22:23,093 --> 00:22:26,359
but I'm pretty sure he never even knew you existed.

325
00:22:28,228 --> 00:22:29,836
You never told him about me?

326
00:22:33,988 --> 00:22:36,906
I was only 14 at the time...

327
00:22:37,844 --> 00:22:39,677
when he raped me.

328
00:22:42,964 --> 00:22:45,594
He attacked 10 other girls before me.

329
00:22:45,779 --> 00:22:48,728
Broke into their homes, raped them,

330
00:22:49,763 --> 00:22:53,608
cut off a piece of them to take with him as some sort of trophy.

331
00:22:53,731 --> 00:22:56,106
I suppose that's what was going to happen to me

332
00:22:56,162 --> 00:22:59,676
if my father hadn't come home early from work that night.

333
00:23:00,879 --> 00:23:02,358
They never caught him.

334
00:23:05,332 --> 00:23:07,003
Why didn't you get an abortion?

335
00:23:07,074 --> 00:23:08,861
I probably should have.

336
00:23:09,986 --> 00:23:13,095
But that isn't what my family believed in at the time.

337
00:23:13,270 --> 00:23:17,533
Regardless of how you were conceived, you were the innocent one.

338
00:23:17,616 --> 00:23:19,521
You deserved to be saved.

339
00:23:20,289 --> 00:23:21,630
Saved?

340
00:23:22,644 --> 00:23:27,027
Do you have any idea who my foster parents were, what they did to me?

341
00:23:27,390 --> 00:23:31,894
- No, and I'm sorry--
- I'm sorry. This is a little...

342
00:23:33,488 --> 00:23:35,956
Little much for me to deal with right now.

343
00:23:38,230 --> 00:23:44,056
The fact is I knew that looking into your face everyday would only remind me of the rape.

344
00:23:44,164 --> 00:23:48,306
I thought I was being responsible giving you up.

345
00:23:48,434 --> 00:23:50,082
But I wasn't.

346
00:23:50,804 --> 00:23:52,872
That's why I'm here now.

347
00:23:54,962 --> 00:23:58,402
You never had a chance to be a good man, Christian.

348
00:23:58,542 --> 00:24:01,920
When you realize who your father was, what he passed on,

349
00:24:03,006 --> 00:24:07,542
and I... I owed it to you after all this time

350
00:24:08,033 --> 00:24:09,887
to tell you myself...

351
00:24:10,572 --> 00:24:17,152
and I owe it to all those other poor girls to try to convince you to stop.

352
00:24:20,571 --> 00:24:25,149
You haven't seen me since I was born, and yet...

353
00:24:27,377 --> 00:24:29,217
you think I'm a killer.

354
00:24:31,730 --> 00:24:35,706
I earn $750,000 a year... at least.

355
00:24:35,810 --> 00:24:37,617
I'm a goddamn surgeon.

356
00:24:38,462 --> 00:24:41,856
Just because my father raped you doesn't mean that I've turned into the same man.

357
00:24:41,917 --> 00:24:42,618
Christian, please--

358
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:45,640
Please don't tell me you've come down here all this way after all this time

359
00:24:45,712 --> 00:24:48,001
to convince me that I'm a murderer.

360
00:24:48,066 --> 00:24:50,657
This wasn't easy for me, either, you know, to dig up the past!

361
00:24:50,714 --> 00:24:51,994
What do you think it's like?!

362
00:24:52,055 --> 00:24:54,304
To realize that my son, whom I never should have had,

363
00:24:54,370 --> 00:24:56,520
turned out to be my worst fear.

364
00:25:04,508 --> 00:25:09,325
I used to fantasize when I was being beaten and molested by my foster father that...

365
00:25:10,053 --> 00:25:12,173
none of that pain could hurt me

366
00:25:12,726 --> 00:25:19,340
because my mother was an angel looking down on me from heaven.

367
00:25:19,652 --> 00:25:21,834
That's what gave me the strength to go on,

368
00:25:24,023 --> 00:25:25,971
make something of my life.

369
00:25:32,381 --> 00:25:34,036
Now I just wish you were dead.

370
00:25:36,396 --> 00:25:38,033
How's that for a confession?

371
00:25:46,334 --> 00:25:47,604
I'm done in here.

372
00:26:04,936 --> 00:26:07,856
Is that really necessary? Those are all $200 shirts.

373
00:26:07,882 --> 00:26:09,829
They're evidence now.

374
00:26:09,910 --> 00:26:14,380
Each one will be sent to the lab for DNA testing to match for traces of blood and semen.

375
00:26:15,170 --> 00:26:16,781
Bag and tag all of these, please.

376
00:26:16,879 --> 00:26:20,693
It just seems excessive. What exactly are you looking for?

377
00:26:20,721 --> 00:26:25,322
Anything that links Dr. Troy to other crime scenes or fits with the profile.

378
00:26:25,394 --> 00:26:26,971
And what profile is that?

379
00:26:27,058 --> 00:26:30,386
Sexually deviant masochist obsessed with appearances.

380
00:26:30,765 --> 00:26:33,744
Well, what do we have here? His closet porn collection.

381
00:26:33,857 --> 00:26:36,202
Of human bondage and suffering.

382
00:26:36,325 --> 00:26:37,651
Whip smart.

383
00:26:37,748 --> 00:26:39,152
The gang-bang gang.

384
00:26:39,243 --> 00:26:41,824
Kimber directs adult videos. I'm sure those are hers.

385
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:45,014
The ones Kimber directs aren't nearly as hardcore as these.

386
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:47,818
Hers have themes of female empowerment, not degradation.

387
00:26:47,881 --> 00:26:49,487
Found these in the kitchen drawer.

388
00:26:52,874 --> 00:26:54,875
Can't say this surprises me.

389
00:26:54,928 --> 00:26:57,763
Very common for criminals to be obsessed with their own crimes

390
00:26:57,803 --> 00:26:59,191
and the press attention they get.

391
00:26:59,268 --> 00:27:01,567
It's a way to relive the rush of the attack.

392
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:04,065
McNamara/Troy is probably mentioned in half those articles.

393
00:27:04,112 --> 00:27:06,405
We do the pro bono work on the victims.

394
00:27:06,466 --> 00:27:10,936
Most people who are victims of violent crimes tend to shun reminders of their own abuse.

395
00:27:11,024 --> 00:27:13,922
That's just a theory. It doesn't prove anything.

396
00:27:13,983 --> 00:27:16,246
I don't even know why I'm indulging your presence.

397
00:27:16,302 --> 00:27:17,204
Why are you?

398
00:27:17,270 --> 00:27:19,963
Because it's time you see Christian for who he really is,

399
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:22,118
a terrifying sociopath.

400
00:27:25,744 --> 00:27:27,136
Case in point.

401
00:27:27,173 --> 00:27:29,696
What's your earth-shattering conclusion, that he's a neat freak?

402
00:27:29,769 --> 00:27:32,549
There's where the-maid-does- neat and then there's scary, obsessive, compulsive neat,

403
00:27:32,601 --> 00:27:35,067
which is always about trying to hide something.

404
00:27:40,628 --> 00:27:42,230
Tranquilizer.

405
00:27:42,635 --> 00:27:46,700
The exact same type the carver uses to paralyze his victims.

406
00:27:51,047 --> 00:27:52,476
I don't understand.

407
00:27:52,722 --> 00:27:55,185
Why would Kit bring your mother in to see you?

408
00:27:57,150 --> 00:27:59,747
Well, I'm busy. You're gonna have to take care of this, all right?

409
00:28:00,377 --> 00:28:02,117
I'm sorry. Where were we?

410
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:05,926
My bail. When can I go home and take a shower?

411
00:28:05,992 --> 00:28:09,899
Well, the police can hold you for another 24 hours before the D.A. has to set up a hearing,

412
00:28:09,956 --> 00:28:11,860
so you might be here for the weekend.

413
00:28:11,917 --> 00:28:14,752
Are you kidding? I have to spend 2 more days in this shit hole?

414
00:28:14,809 --> 00:28:16,412
Trust me, that's the good news.

415
00:28:16,468 --> 00:28:19,305
That means they're trying to buy some more time to build a stronger case.

416
00:28:19,365 --> 00:28:21,128
How can they not have a case?

417
00:28:21,189 --> 00:28:24,398
They've already arrested him, searched his apartment, found the condom...

418
00:28:24,456 --> 00:28:26,519
Bottom line, if they thought they had their man,

419
00:28:26,575 --> 00:28:29,412
they would've released his identity to the media by now.

420
00:28:29,464 --> 00:28:31,297
Which brings me to your defense.

421
00:28:31,383 --> 00:28:34,963
Now, our strategy from this point on is to expose police abuses,

422
00:28:35,023 --> 00:28:36,779
and discredit their investigation.

423
00:28:36,846 --> 00:28:40,594
Now, the way we do that is conduct our own inquiry, and spin it in our favor.

424
00:28:40,706 --> 00:28:42,657
That's gonna take a lot of resources.

425
00:28:42,714 --> 00:28:44,770
What does that mean in regards to your fee?

426
00:28:44,828 --> 00:28:47,128
Well, it's tough to give you a hard and fast number, but

427
00:28:47,179 --> 00:28:52,079
given the scope and nature of this case, I'd say anywhere between 3 and 5 million.

428
00:28:57,435 --> 00:28:59,601
Could you excuse us for a moment?

429
00:28:59,692 --> 00:29:00,528
Certainly.

430
00:29:00,644 --> 00:29:01,438
Thank you.

431
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:16,215
I can take out a loan against the business. Will you help me do that?

432
00:29:16,342 --> 00:29:18,196
Look, this guy's the best in Miami. It's gonna cost,

433
00:29:18,258 --> 00:29:20,449
but I can't take any more chances if I want my freedom.

434
00:29:20,511 --> 00:29:23,582
They found the tranquilizer in your apartment, Christian.

435
00:29:27,637 --> 00:29:30,342
So you're not gonna try to deny it was yours?

436
00:29:35,974 --> 00:29:39,578
I ordered it a month ago through the office.

437
00:29:39,875 --> 00:29:41,083
It's not what you think.

438
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:42,276
It's not?

439
00:29:42,486 --> 00:29:45,589
'Cause at this point, I'm not so sure anymore.

440
00:29:48,248 --> 00:29:50,509
Look, I bought it because I was having doubts.

441
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:54,226
I didn't know if I was actually paralyzed that night, or if...

442
00:29:55,071 --> 00:29:57,175
I was just willing to let him hurt me.

443
00:29:58,440 --> 00:29:59,766
I don't understand.

444
00:29:59,883 --> 00:30:03,185
Come on, Sean, I'm a strong guy. 5 ccs of that stuff isn't enough

445
00:30:03,238 --> 00:30:05,925
to paralyze me to the point where I can't move.

446
00:30:06,002 --> 00:30:08,680
I had the same thing happen to me, and I couldn't move for an hour.

447
00:30:08,730 --> 00:30:11,188
- I don't know why you would think--
- Because I did move.

448
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:14,619
I moved my fingers when it was happening to me.

449
00:30:15,243 --> 00:30:18,536
I don't know if it was a reflex or a nerve twitch or something, but...

450
00:30:21,019 --> 00:30:26,339
I lie awake every night wondering if I could've done something.

451
00:30:27,214 --> 00:30:30,307
If I didn't fight back because in some kind of way, I...

452
00:30:32,222 --> 00:30:33,923
I feel like I deserve it.

453
00:30:39,426 --> 00:30:40,654
For what?

454
00:30:40,752 --> 00:30:41,898
For what?!

455
00:30:43,614 --> 00:30:45,785
For screwing Julia when you were engaged.

456
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:49,323
For cheating on every girlfriend I've ever had.

457
00:30:49,682 --> 00:30:53,808
For charging 10 grand to raise a pair of sagging tits on some socialite bitch.

458
00:30:53,864 --> 00:30:56,138
For generally being a soulless man.

459
00:30:56,239 --> 00:30:57,469
Take your pick.

460
00:30:59,215 --> 00:31:01,267
You need to believe me, Sean.

461
00:31:01,678 --> 00:31:04,851
If I'm their guy, that means I cut you.

462
00:31:04,989 --> 00:31:08,078
That means I took a knife, and I cut your face.

463
00:31:11,682 --> 00:31:13,530
Do you really think I could do that?

464
00:31:25,267 --> 00:31:26,762
I'm gonna go back to my cell.

465
00:31:26,827 --> 00:31:29,736
It's getting a little uncomfortable in here.

466
00:32:19,007 --> 00:32:20,614
Good evening, this is Andrea Hall

467
00:32:20,670 --> 00:32:25,231
at Miami dade police processing center, with a WCNU exclusive.

468
00:32:25,288 --> 00:32:28,314
A local plastic surgeon, Dr. Christian Troy,

469
00:32:28,391 --> 00:32:31,822
has been arrested on suspicion of being the carver.

470
00:32:31,893 --> 00:32:34,536
Just 36 hours after the murder of Rhea Reynolds,

471
00:32:34,596 --> 00:32:38,165
police said they finally caught a break in the case that has kept Miami

472
00:32:38,221 --> 00:32:41,447
in the grip of fear for the last 6 months.

473
00:32:41,523 --> 00:32:43,919
A police spokesman would not reveal any details

474
00:32:43,930 --> 00:32:46,430
of the evidence that led to Dr. Troy's arrest,

475
00:32:46,486 --> 00:32:51,278
but did tell me a special investigator had been targeting the doctor for some time.

476
00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:54,800
An ironic twist in this arrest is that it was Dr. Troy,

477
00:32:54,866 --> 00:32:57,892
part of the surgery team of McNamara/Troy,

478
00:32:57,949 --> 00:33:02,875
who had volunteered to repair the faces of the victims he allegedly carved.

479
00:33:02,952 --> 00:33:06,029
A few of those women who were contacted for reaction to the news

480
00:33:06,075 --> 00:33:08,317
refused to comment at this time.

481
00:33:08,390 --> 00:33:14,784
Without a doubt, local reaction in the Miami area is one of relief and cautious optimism.

482
00:33:51,417 --> 00:33:52,713
Honey, are you awake?

483
00:33:56,895 --> 00:33:59,164
You were tossing and turning so much.

484
00:33:59,247 --> 00:34:00,849
What, you having a bad dream?

485
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:02,851
It was horrible.

486
00:34:03,609 --> 00:34:05,891
I was in prison.

487
00:34:06,995 --> 00:34:09,481
Well, I made you your favorite breakfast.

488
00:34:09,568 --> 00:34:11,924
Maybe that will help make you feel better.

489
00:34:16,139 --> 00:34:20,336
And if you hurry up and finish, I'll let you shave my legs.

490
00:34:23,915 --> 00:34:25,724
And who knows what else.

491
00:34:54,963 --> 00:34:57,112
Boy, is this your lucky day.

492
00:34:57,958 --> 00:34:58,908
Let's go.

493
00:35:07,539 --> 00:35:11,689
Isn't there some kind of rule where I'm allowed time to rest between interrogations?

494
00:35:11,706 --> 00:35:12,882
You're free to go.

495
00:35:13,110 --> 00:35:14,029
What?

496
00:35:14,470 --> 00:35:17,051
Detective McGraw met with the D.A. this morning,

497
00:35:17,532 --> 00:35:20,091
convinced him to drop all charges.

498
00:35:32,822 --> 00:35:33,880
Why?

499
00:35:34,371 --> 00:35:36,823
I guess the real carver struck again last night.

500
00:35:36,912 --> 00:35:40,388
Evidence at the crime scene was enough to convince her that you were innocent.

501
00:36:29,904 --> 00:36:31,077
Mr. Trapp.

502
00:36:31,685 --> 00:36:34,430
Oh, my god. It's you.

503
00:36:34,526 --> 00:36:35,997
I didn't mean to startle you.

504
00:36:36,021 --> 00:36:38,040
I'll go see if I can find Dr. McNamara.

505
00:36:38,051 --> 00:36:40,292
No. No. No. I'm glad you're here.

506
00:36:40,344 --> 00:36:43,426
Uh, I need someone to give me the final once over.

507
00:36:43,522 --> 00:36:45,499
Can you do it so I can be discharged?

508
00:36:58,745 --> 00:37:03,169
The filler has set, and I don't see any sign of infection.

509
00:37:03,256 --> 00:37:07,106
You'll need to take some antibiotics for a few weeks, but otherwise, you look--

510
00:37:07,148 --> 00:37:09,527
Like my old self again.

511
00:37:10,245 --> 00:37:11,494
It's funny.

512
00:37:12,088 --> 00:37:14,477
Last week when people looked at me,

513
00:37:14,582 --> 00:37:16,700
all they saw was ad dying man.

514
00:37:19,415 --> 00:37:22,082
Today I look ready to take on the world.

515
00:37:22,419 --> 00:37:25,405
It's like my whole identity changed overnight.

516
00:37:25,722 --> 00:37:27,535
At least yours was for the better.

517
00:37:28,692 --> 00:37:30,499
On the outside, yeah.

518
00:37:30,650 --> 00:37:33,290
But on the inside, I'm still the same person.

519
00:37:36,507 --> 00:37:38,046
I guess, uh...

520
00:37:40,950 --> 00:37:43,053
people only see what they want to.

521
00:37:59,870 --> 00:38:01,026
There you are.

522
00:38:05,296 --> 00:38:08,126
God, I was so relieved when I heard you got out.

523
00:38:19,448 --> 00:38:21,853
I never should have doubted you, Christian.

524
00:38:21,940 --> 00:38:24,322
I knew it was all a case of mistaken identity.

525
00:38:34,826 --> 00:38:37,427
Can you believe that Andrea Hall jumped the gun like that?

526
00:38:39,897 --> 00:38:42,390
Half our appointments cancelled this week.

527
00:38:42,487 --> 00:38:45,845
The other half, I'm sure, aren't even bothering to call to say they're not coming in.

528
00:38:46,036 --> 00:38:48,703
With everything you went through, I have half a mind to call the station and--

529
00:38:48,758 --> 00:38:50,183
It's not a problem, Sean.

530
00:38:50,269 --> 00:38:51,371
Are you kidding?

531
00:38:51,719 --> 00:38:54,176
This might take months for us to recover from.

532
00:38:54,263 --> 00:38:57,156
Right now, we have no surgeries on the books.

533
00:38:57,525 --> 00:39:02,098
She reported the story because I called her and told her what happened.

534
00:39:07,166 --> 00:39:09,577
They still give you one call in prison, you know.

535
00:39:10,437 --> 00:39:13,437
You leaked the story? Why?

536
00:39:14,837 --> 00:39:18,742
Because I knew the real carver would hate not getting credit for his own work.

537
00:39:18,887 --> 00:39:21,298
So you knew he would strike out again.

538
00:39:21,503 --> 00:39:22,792
I hoped he would.

539
00:39:23,064 --> 00:39:24,713
Then they'd have to release me.

540
00:39:24,814 --> 00:39:28,112
You planned to get out of prison by sacrificing another innocent person?

541
00:39:28,123 --> 00:39:29,392
How could you even think like that?

542
00:39:29,404 --> 00:39:31,107
I had no choice, Sean.

543
00:39:31,598 --> 00:39:35,459
Everyone in my life, everybody that I trusted abandoned me, including you!

544
00:39:38,951 --> 00:39:40,625
Jesus Christ.

545
00:39:44,302 --> 00:39:46,503
We've known each other for 20 years.

546
00:39:48,326 --> 00:39:50,127
I thought you knew me.

547
00:39:51,424 --> 00:39:53,189
I thought I did, too.

548
00:39:57,611 --> 00:39:58,864
You're back.

549
00:40:04,203 --> 00:40:07,950
The latest carver victim is in your office, Christian.

550
00:40:43,330 --> 00:40:45,632
Tell me what you don't like about yourself.
