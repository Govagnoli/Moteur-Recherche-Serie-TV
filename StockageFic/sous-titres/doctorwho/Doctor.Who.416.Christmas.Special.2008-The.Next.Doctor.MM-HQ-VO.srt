<i>Mistletoe!</i>

2
00:00:20,829 --> 00:00:21,807
<i>Mistletoe!</i>

3
00:00:30,158 --> 00:00:31,749
- Fresh here today.
- Good afternoon.

4
00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:54,618
Hot chestnuts. Chestnuts.

5
00:00:54,864 --> 00:00:58,509
# Oh, tidings of comfort and joy

6
00:00:58,669 --> 00:01:00,309
# Comfort and joy... #

7
00:01:00,651 --> 00:01:03,440
- You there, boy. What day is this?
- Christmas Eve, sir.

8
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:05,578
- What year?
- You thick or something?

9
00:01:05,874 --> 00:01:07,533
Oi. Just answer the question.

10
00:01:07,633 --> 00:01:09,809
Year of our Lord 1851, sir.

11
00:01:09,909 --> 00:01:12,360
Right. Nice year. Bit dull.

12
00:01:12,751 --> 00:01:13,872
<i>Doctor!</i>

13
00:01:16,067 --> 00:01:17,411
<i>Doctor?</i>

14
00:01:18,679 --> 00:01:19,739
Who, me?

15
00:01:21,373 --> 00:01:22,509
<i>Doctor!</i>

16
00:01:23,399 --> 00:01:25,890
Don't worry, don't worry. Stand back,
what have we got here?

17
00:01:27,613 --> 00:01:30,263
I Got it. Whatever's behind that door
I think you should get out of here.

18
00:01:30,363 --> 00:01:31,355
Doctor!

19
00:01:31,455 --> 00:01:33,083
No, I'm standing right here. Hello.

20
00:01:33,183 --> 00:01:35,779
- Don't be so stupid, who are you?
- I'm The Doctor.

21
00:01:35,943 --> 00:01:37,702
- Doctor who?
- Just The Doctor.

22
00:01:37,878 --> 00:01:40,762
Well, there can't be two of ya.
Where the hell have you been?

23
00:01:40,862 --> 00:01:43,741
Right there. Don't worry. Stand back.
What have we got here, then?

24
00:01:43,893 --> 00:01:47,789
- Hold on, hold on. Who are you?
- I'm The Doctor. Simply The Doctor.

25
00:01:48,126 --> 00:01:50,425
The one, the only and the best.

26
00:01:50,525 --> 00:01:52,481
Rosita, give me the sonic screwdriver.

27
00:01:52,581 --> 00:01:54,525
- What?
- Now quickly, get back to the TARDIS.

28
00:01:54,625 --> 00:01:56,389
- Back to the what?
- Stand back, sir.

29
00:01:56,489 --> 00:01:58,617
This is a job for a Time Lord.

30
00:01:59,027 --> 00:02:00,089
Job for a what lord?

31
00:02:02,049 --> 00:02:03,778
- Oh, that's different.
- Oh, that's new.

32
00:02:04,724 --> 00:02:06,282
"Allons-y."

37
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:48,687
I've been hunting this beast for a
good fortnight. Now step back, sir.

38
00:02:51,985 --> 00:02:53,771
Some sort of primitive conversion,

39
00:02:54,434 --> 00:02:56,110
like they took the brain
of a cat or a dog.

40
00:02:56,210 --> 00:02:58,349
Well, talking's all very well.
Rosita.

41
00:02:58,549 --> 00:03:01,381
- I'm ready.
- Now, watch and learn.

42
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:12,859
Excellent. Now then, let's pull
this timorous beastie down to earth.

43
00:03:16,211 --> 00:03:17,088
Or not.

44
00:03:17,188 --> 00:03:18,873
I might be in a little bit of trouble.

45
00:03:19,119 --> 00:03:20,842
Nothing changes. I've got you.

46
00:03:25,338 --> 00:03:26,369
You idiots!

47
00:03:29,376 --> 00:03:30,526
Perhaps if you could pull?

48
00:03:30,626 --> 00:03:33,548
I am pulling. In this position,
I couldn't not pull, could I?

49
00:03:38,149 --> 00:03:39,589
Then I'd suggest you let go, sir.

50
00:03:39,689 --> 00:03:42,798
I'm not letting you out of my sight,
Doctor. Don't you recognise me?

51
00:03:42,898 --> 00:03:44,869
No, should I? Have we met?

52
00:03:45,195 --> 00:03:48,212
This is hardly the right time for me
to go through my social calendar.

53
00:03:54,035 --> 00:03:54,824
Whoa!

54
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:11,149
- It's gonna jump!
- We're gonna fa-a-a-all!

55
00:04:40,723 --> 00:04:42,540
Well, I'm glad you think it's so funny.

56
00:04:43,732 --> 00:04:46,786
You're mad. Both of you.
You could've got killed.

57
00:04:47,026 --> 00:04:48,803
But, evidently, we did not.

58
00:04:48,974 --> 00:04:51,305
Oh, I should introduce Rosita.

59
00:04:51,709 --> 00:04:53,940
My faithful companion,
always telling me off.

60
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,349
Well, they do, don't they?

61
00:04:55,801 --> 00:04:56,794
Rosita?

62
00:04:57,597 --> 00:04:59,749
Good name. Hello, Rosita.

63
00:05:00,164 --> 00:05:02,600
Huh. Now I'll have to go
and dismantle the traps.

64
00:05:03,445 --> 00:05:04,530
All that for nothing.

65
00:05:04,758 --> 00:05:07,240
And we've only got 20 minutes
till the funeral, don't forget.

66
00:05:08,381 --> 00:05:10,029
Then back to the TARDIS, right?

67
00:05:10,394 --> 00:05:12,549
- Funeral?
- Oh, long story.

68
00:05:12,728 --> 00:05:14,769
Not my own, not yet.

69
00:05:14,869 --> 00:05:17,653
Oooh, I'm not as young as I was.

70
00:05:17,873 --> 00:05:20,044
Well, not as young as you were
when you were me.

71
00:05:20,144 --> 00:05:21,189
When I was who?

72
00:05:22,384 --> 00:05:24,469
- You really don't recognise me?
- Not at all.

73
00:05:25,644 --> 00:05:27,010
But you're The Doctor.

74
00:05:27,749 --> 00:05:29,004
The next Doctor.

75
00:05:29,673 --> 00:05:31,949
Or the next but one,
a future Doctor anyway.

76
00:05:32,178 --> 00:05:34,509
No, no, don't tell me
how it happened. Although...

77
00:05:35,264 --> 00:05:37,796
I hope I don't just trip over a brick,
that'd be embarrassing.

78
00:05:37,896 --> 00:05:39,283
Then again, painless.

79
00:05:39,719 --> 00:05:42,350
- Worse way to go, depends on the brick.
- You're gabbling, sir.

80
00:05:42,722 --> 00:05:45,661
Now, might I ask,
who are you, exactly?

81
00:05:48,886 --> 00:05:50,160
No, I'm, uh...

82
00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:53,918
I'm just Smith. John Smith.
But I've heard all about you, Doctor.

83
00:05:54,729 --> 00:05:56,574
Bit of a legend, if I say so myself.

84
00:05:57,569 --> 00:06:01,508
Modesty forbids me to agree
with you, sir. But yes. Yes, I am.

85
00:06:01,899 --> 00:06:04,666
A legend with certain memories missing.

86
00:06:04,766 --> 00:06:06,829
- Am I right?
- How do you know that?

87
00:06:07,263 --> 00:06:08,629
You've forgotten me.

88
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:13,149
Great swathes of my life
have been stolen away.

89
00:06:13,854 --> 00:06:15,766
When I turn my mind to the past,

90
00:06:17,034 --> 00:06:19,262
- there's nothing.
- Going how far back?

91
00:06:19,362 --> 00:06:20,536
Since the Cybermen.

92
00:06:21,807 --> 00:06:24,867
Masters of that hellish wall-scuttler
and old enemies of mine.

93
00:06:24,967 --> 00:06:26,555
Now at work in London town.

94
00:06:26,972 --> 00:06:28,366
You won't believe this, Mr Smith,

95
00:06:29,111 --> 00:06:31,469
but they are creatures
from another world.

96
00:06:31,924 --> 00:06:34,109
Really? Wow.

97
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:38,872
It's said they fell onto London,
out of the sky in a blaze of light.

98
00:06:41,511 --> 00:06:42,451
And they found me.

99
00:06:48,754 --> 00:06:50,193
Something was taken.

100
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:52,969
And something was lost.

101
00:06:55,381 --> 00:06:56,372
What was I like?

102
00:06:57,860 --> 00:06:58,689
In the past?

103
00:07:00,756 --> 00:07:02,788
I don't think I should say. Sorry.

104
00:07:03,097 --> 00:07:05,268
Got to be careful with memory loss.
One wrong word...

105
00:07:05,368 --> 00:07:06,568
It's strange, though.

106
00:07:07,299 --> 00:07:10,189
I talk of Cybermen from the stars

107
00:07:11,558 --> 00:07:13,477
and you don't blink, Mr Smith.

108
00:07:13,577 --> 00:07:14,961
Ah, don't blink, remember that?

109
00:07:15,789 --> 00:07:18,309
Whatever you do, don't blink?
The blinking and the statues?

110
00:07:18,866 --> 00:07:20,481
Sally and the angels? No?

111
00:07:21,112 --> 00:07:22,789
You're a very odd man.

112
00:07:23,579 --> 00:07:24,875
Hmm, I still am.

113
00:07:26,534 --> 00:07:28,402
- Something's wrong here.
- Oh, the funeral.

114
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:30,149
The funeral's at two o'clock.

115
00:07:30,484 --> 00:07:33,049
It's been a pleasure, Mr Smith.
Don't breathe a word of it.

116
00:07:33,149 --> 00:07:35,416
- Can't I come with you?
- It's far dangerous.

117
00:07:35,731 --> 00:07:38,009
Rest assured, I shall keep
this city safe.

118
00:07:38,109 --> 00:07:39,429
Oh, and, er...

119
00:07:40,249 --> 00:07:43,169
- merry Christmas, Mr Smith.
- Merry Christmas, Doctor.

120
00:07:55,866 --> 00:07:59,116
Report. Cybershade 16 has made contact.

121
00:07:59,835 --> 00:08:01,595
Then observe the enemy.

122
00:08:02,149 --> 00:08:03,909
This man is dangerous.

123
00:08:04,138 --> 00:08:06,309
This man is our enemy.

124
00:08:06,547 --> 00:08:08,794
This man is The Doctor.

125
00:08:08,894 --> 00:08:11,746
I've been hunting this beast for a
good fortnight. Now step back, sir.

126
00:08:12,484 --> 00:08:15,146
The attack is scheduled for 1400 hours.

127
00:08:15,246 --> 00:08:18,158
Plans for the Ascension
demand a successful intervention.

128
00:08:18,258 --> 00:08:20,176
Is everything in position?

129
00:08:20,276 --> 00:08:22,075
That's rather dependent on you.

130
00:08:22,542 --> 00:08:24,415
All I can promise is to do my best.

131
00:08:24,515 --> 00:08:26,789
Define the parameters of "best".

132
00:08:27,519 --> 00:08:31,809
As you would say, I will operate
at maximum efficiency.

133
00:08:32,414 --> 00:08:34,143
And you'll keep
your part of the bargain?

134
00:08:34,243 --> 00:08:38,553
You will be heralded, in the new age
at the Court of the CyberKing.

135
00:08:38,755 --> 00:08:40,709
The CyberKing will rise.

136
00:08:41,259 --> 00:08:45,137
The CyberKing will rise, indeed.

137
00:08:46,021 --> 00:08:47,062
How like a man.

138
00:08:48,828 --> 00:08:50,443
Now, if you'll excuse me,

139
00:08:51,314 --> 00:08:53,169
I have a funeral to attend.

140
00:09:03,133 --> 00:09:07,745
The late Reverend Fairchild, leaving his
place of residence for the last time.

141
00:09:09,297 --> 00:09:10,623
God rest his soul.

142
00:09:12,621 --> 00:09:14,804
Now, with the house empty,

143
00:09:14,904 --> 00:09:18,223
I shall effect an entrance at the rear
while you go back to the TARDIS.

144
00:09:19,132 --> 00:09:21,189
This is hardly work for a woman.

145
00:09:21,761 --> 00:09:23,484
Oh, don't mind me saving your life.

146
00:09:23,584 --> 00:09:25,067
That's work for a woman, isn't it?

147
00:09:25,167 --> 00:09:28,948
The Doctor's companion does what
The Doctor says. Off you go.

148
00:09:41,834 --> 00:09:43,803
- Hello.
- How did you get in?

149
00:09:43,967 --> 00:09:45,749
Oh, front door. I'm good at doors.

150
00:09:46,484 --> 00:09:49,375
Do you mind my asking,
is that your sonic screwdriver?

151
00:09:49,646 --> 00:09:51,789
Yeah. I'd be lost without it.

152
00:09:52,416 --> 00:09:53,444
That's a screwdriver.

153
00:09:55,047 --> 00:09:56,189
How's it sonic?

154
00:09:56,874 --> 00:09:58,590
Well, er, it makes a noise.

155
00:09:59,644 --> 00:10:00,957
That's sonic, isn't it?

156
00:10:01,228 --> 00:10:03,089
Now, since we're acting
like common burglars,

157
00:10:03,189 --> 00:10:04,609
I suggest we get out of plain view.

158
00:10:09,806 --> 00:10:12,078
This investigation of yours,
what's it about?

159
00:10:12,178 --> 00:10:13,561
It started with a murder.

160
00:10:13,661 --> 00:10:15,081
Oh, good.

161
00:10:16,690 --> 00:10:18,044
I mean bad, but whose?

162
00:10:18,732 --> 00:10:21,960
Mr Jackson Lake, a teacher
of mathematics from Sussex.

163
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:24,181
He came to London three weeks ago

164
00:10:24,824 --> 00:10:27,349
- and died a terrible death.
- Cybermen?

165
00:10:28,157 --> 00:10:32,029
It's hard to say, his body was
never found. But then it started.

166
00:10:32,129 --> 00:10:34,251
More secret murders,
then abductions.

167
00:10:35,128 --> 00:10:38,435
Children, stolen away in silence.

168
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,962
- So whose house is this?
- The latest murder.

169
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:46,229
The Reverend Aubrey Fairchild.
Found with burns to his forehead,

170
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:48,343
like some advanced form
of electrocution.

171
00:10:48,892 --> 00:10:51,738
- But who was he, was he important?
- You ask a lot of questions.

172
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,269
I'm your companion.

173
00:10:54,629 --> 00:10:56,896
The Reverend,
was the pillar of the community,

174
00:10:57,423 --> 00:10:59,103
a member of many parish boards.

175
00:10:59,203 --> 00:11:00,999
A keen advocate of children's charity.

176
00:11:01,099 --> 00:11:02,097
Children again.

177
00:11:02,273 --> 00:11:03,949
Why would the Cybermen want him dead?

178
00:11:04,646 --> 00:11:07,726
And what's his connection
to the first death, this Jackson Lake?

179
00:11:09,315 --> 00:11:10,344
It's funny,

180
00:11:11,719 --> 00:11:13,609
I seem to be telling you everything.

181
00:11:15,169 --> 00:11:17,100
As though you
engendered some sort of...

182
00:11:18,149 --> 00:11:18,849
trust.

183
00:11:20,690 --> 00:11:22,389
You seem familiar, Mr Smith.

184
00:11:23,832 --> 00:11:24,989
I know your face.

185
00:11:26,643 --> 00:11:29,356
- But how?
- I wonder.

186
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:33,413
I can't help noticing
you're wearing a fob watch.

187
00:11:35,299 --> 00:11:36,430
Is that important?

188
00:11:37,383 --> 00:11:40,273
Legend has it
that the memories of a Time Lord

189
00:11:40,689 --> 00:11:42,669
can be contained within a watch.

190
00:11:44,285 --> 00:11:44,989
Do you mind?

191
00:11:48,622 --> 00:11:49,682
It's said

192
00:11:50,401 --> 00:11:51,509
that if it's opened...

193
00:11:54,476 --> 00:11:56,069
Oh. Maybe not.

194
00:11:56,755 --> 00:12:00,206
- It's more for decoration.
- Yeah. Anyway, alien infiltration.

195
00:12:00,306 --> 00:12:02,925
Yes, Look for anything different,
possibly metal.

196
00:12:03,025 --> 00:12:04,522
Anything that doesn't seem to belong,

197
00:12:04,622 --> 00:12:07,251
perhaps a mechanical device
that could fit no earthly engine.

198
00:12:07,351 --> 00:12:08,796
It could even seem to be organic,

199
00:12:09,124 --> 00:12:11,926
but unlike any organism
of the natural world. Shh!

200
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:13,988
What's that noise?

201
00:12:14,468 --> 00:12:16,529
Oh, it's just me...

202
00:12:17,387 --> 00:12:18,245
whistling.

203
00:12:21,494 --> 00:12:22,964
I wonder what's in here, though.

204
00:12:25,764 --> 00:12:26,401
Ah.

205
00:12:27,858 --> 00:12:29,877
Different and metal, you were right.

206
00:12:29,977 --> 00:12:32,016
They are infostamps.

207
00:12:33,259 --> 00:12:34,830
I mean, at a guess.

208
00:12:35,959 --> 00:12:39,734
If I were you, I'd say they worked
something like this.

209
00:12:42,207 --> 00:12:44,453
See? Compressed information.

210
00:12:45,078 --> 00:12:46,018
Tons of it.

211
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:51,669
That is the history of London,
1066 to the present day.

212
00:12:52,829 --> 00:12:54,564
This is like a disk, a Cyberdisk.

213
00:12:54,664 --> 00:12:56,937
But why would the Cybermen
need something so simple?

214
00:12:58,689 --> 00:13:00,069
They've gotta be wireless.

215
00:13:01,875 --> 00:13:02,992
Unless...

216
00:13:03,932 --> 00:13:06,361
they're in the wrong century,
they haven't got much power.

217
00:13:06,904 --> 00:13:09,629
They need plain old basic
infostamps to update themselves.

218
00:13:09,729 --> 00:13:11,829
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

219
00:13:12,932 --> 00:13:13,815
No, what is it?

220
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:17,529
- What's wrong?
- I've seen one of these before.

221
00:13:22,981 --> 00:13:24,319
I was holding...

222
00:13:25,151 --> 00:13:26,349
this device,

223
00:13:27,006 --> 00:13:28,452
the night I lost my mind.

224
00:13:30,131 --> 00:13:31,506
The night I regenerated.

225
00:13:39,195 --> 00:13:42,015
The Cybermen, they made me change.

226
00:13:42,558 --> 00:13:44,789
My mind, my face, my whole self.

227
00:13:46,703 --> 00:13:47,757
And you were there.

228
00:13:49,164 --> 00:13:50,003
Who are you?

229
00:13:50,602 --> 00:13:51,442
A friend.

230
00:13:52,382 --> 00:13:53,227
I swear.

231
00:13:54,218 --> 00:13:55,709
Then I beg you, John.

232
00:13:56,186 --> 00:13:57,134
Help me.

233
00:13:57,638 --> 00:13:58,251
Ah.

234
00:13:59,241 --> 00:14:00,509
Two words I never refuse.

235
00:14:03,285 --> 00:14:05,375
But it's not a conversation
for a dead man's house.

236
00:14:05,475 --> 00:14:08,749
It'll make more sense if we go back
to the TARDIS... Your TARDIS.

237
00:14:08,909 --> 00:14:12,178
Hold on, I just need to do
a final check. Won't take a tick.

238
00:14:12,803 --> 00:14:16,336
There's one more thing I cannot figure.
If this room's got infostamps, maybe,

239
00:14:16,904 --> 00:14:19,546
just maybe, it's got something
that needs infostamping.

240
00:14:20,890 --> 00:14:21,811
OK.

241
00:14:22,234 --> 00:14:23,549
I think we should run.

242
00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:27,357
- Run, Doctor! Now, Doctor!
- Delete!

243
00:14:30,913 --> 00:14:32,569
The Doctor will be deleted.

244
00:14:34,768 --> 00:14:37,549
- Delete!
- Stairs! Can't lead them outside!

245
00:14:45,369 --> 00:14:46,253
Delete!

246
00:14:47,557 --> 00:14:49,178
I'm a dab hand with a cutlass.

247
00:14:49,278 --> 00:14:51,267
You don't want to come near me
when I've got one of these.

248
00:14:51,367 --> 00:14:53,189
This is your last warning. No?

249
00:14:53,289 --> 00:14:55,401
OK, this is really your last warning!

250
00:14:55,501 --> 00:14:56,544
- I give up.
- Delete!

251
00:14:56,644 --> 00:14:57,472
Listen to me!

252
00:14:57,572 --> 00:15:00,066
Whatever you're doing stuck in 1851,
I can help!

253
00:15:00,166 --> 00:15:03,246
I'm the only person in the world
who can help you! Listen to me!

254
00:15:03,346 --> 00:15:04,343
Delete!

255
00:15:04,646 --> 00:15:05,902
I'm The Doctor.

256
00:15:06,192 --> 00:15:09,711
You need me. Check your memory
banks, my name's The Doctor.

257
00:15:09,951 --> 00:15:12,909
Leave this man alone,
The Doctor is me!

258
00:15:14,231 --> 00:15:15,108
Delete!

259
00:15:15,929 --> 00:15:18,606
The Doctor, remember?
I'm The Doctor!

260
00:15:19,370 --> 00:15:22,969
You need me alive!
You need The Doctor, and that's me!

261
00:15:29,029 --> 00:15:30,183
Delete!

262
00:15:45,976 --> 00:15:48,549
Infostamp with
a cyclo-Steinham core.

263
00:15:48,886 --> 00:15:51,149
You ripped open the core
and broke the safety, zap!

264
00:15:52,672 --> 00:15:55,397
- Only The Doctor would think of that.
- I did that...

265
00:15:57,133 --> 00:15:58,061
last time.

266
00:15:59,032 --> 00:16:00,281
Come here, you'll be OK.

267
00:16:02,029 --> 00:16:03,208
Let me just check.

268
00:16:03,909 --> 00:16:06,313
You told them you were The Doctor.
Why did you do that?

269
00:16:06,413 --> 00:16:08,669
Oh, I was just protecting you.

270
00:16:08,993 --> 00:16:12,104
You're trying to take away
the only thing I've got, like they did.

271
00:16:13,044 --> 00:16:16,225
They stole something,
something so precious.

272
00:16:18,052 --> 00:16:19,109
But I can't remember.

273
00:16:19,998 --> 00:16:21,121
What happened to me?

274
00:16:21,727 --> 00:16:23,760
- What did they do?
- We'll find out.

275
00:16:25,009 --> 00:16:26,246
You and me, together.

276
00:16:30,277 --> 00:16:33,343
Forasmuch as it hath pleased
Almighty God of his great mercy,

277
00:16:33,494 --> 00:16:36,869
to take unto Himself the soul
of our dear brother here departed,

278
00:16:37,042 --> 00:16:39,275
we therefore commit
his body to the ground.

279
00:16:39,749 --> 00:16:43,585
Earth to earth, ashes to ashes
and dust to dust,

280
00:16:43,995 --> 00:16:47,396
in sure and certain hope of the
Resurrection to eternal life,

281
00:16:47,686 --> 00:16:49,427
through our Lord Jesus Christ,

282
00:16:50,998 --> 00:16:55,393
who shall change our vile body,
that it may be like

283
00:16:56,106 --> 00:17:00,833
unto his glorious body,
according to the mighty working...

284
00:17:02,650 --> 00:17:03,730
Do continue.

285
00:17:04,576 --> 00:17:06,771
Madam, I must protest.

286
00:17:06,979 --> 00:17:08,097
Whatever for?

287
00:17:08,197 --> 00:17:11,238
A lady at the graveside
is debatable enough, but...

288
00:17:12,071 --> 00:17:14,469
- your apparel...
- Is it too exciting?

289
00:17:14,569 --> 00:17:17,116
You're disgracing the ceremony,
dressed like a harlot.

290
00:17:17,375 --> 00:17:19,735
Oh, and you should know, Mr Cole.

291
00:17:19,835 --> 00:17:20,846
How do you know my name?

292
00:17:20,946 --> 00:17:26,069
You've walked past me so many times,
all you good men of charity,

293
00:17:26,398 --> 00:17:28,229
never once asking my name.

294
00:17:28,389 --> 00:17:30,461
It's Miss Hartigan, isn't it?

295
00:17:30,729 --> 00:17:32,177
Oh, you noticed.

296
00:17:32,588 --> 00:17:35,228
I saw you looking, you cheeky boy.

297
00:17:36,409 --> 00:17:37,789
I'm sorry, but who is she?

298
00:17:37,889 --> 00:17:41,902
Matron of the St Joseph Workhouse,
your humble servant.

299
00:17:42,444 --> 00:17:43,749
Oh, I've watched you all.

300
00:17:44,365 --> 00:17:45,790
Visiting, smiling.

301
00:17:46,579 --> 00:17:49,332
Bestowing your beneficence upon the poor

302
00:17:49,502 --> 00:17:51,490
while I scrubbed down their filthy beds.

303
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:53,983
I must insist that you depart.

304
00:17:54,261 --> 00:17:57,276
But that's why the late
Reverend Fairchild had to die.

305
00:17:58,891 --> 00:18:00,948
To gather you all in one place.

306
00:18:01,048 --> 00:18:02,616
Where better than a funeral?

307
00:18:03,323 --> 00:18:06,465
Man that is born of woman
hath but a short time to live.

308
00:18:06,748 --> 00:18:10,174
Although I've got some friends
who might disagree with that.

309
00:18:10,274 --> 00:18:11,518
Would you like to meet them?

310
00:18:12,282 --> 00:18:14,915
Hark! I can hear them now.

311
00:18:49,624 --> 00:18:54,431
Mr Cole, Mr Scoones, Mr Fetch,
Mr Milligan, stay where you are.

312
00:18:54,531 --> 00:18:59,309
You're needed. The rest of you are
disposable. Sorry.

313
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:01,319
But what manner of men are they?

314
00:19:02,183 --> 00:19:03,288
Cybermen.

315
00:19:04,467 --> 00:19:06,095
Save yourselves!

316
00:19:23,262 --> 00:19:28,354
I repeat, Mr Cole, Mr Scoones,
Mr Fetch, Mr Milligan. Stay.

317
00:19:54,294 --> 00:19:57,909
- You monstrous witch!
- Merry Christmas to you, too.

318
00:19:58,069 --> 00:19:59,649
But why are we spared?

319
00:19:59,749 --> 00:20:02,423
- What do you need us for?
- Your children.

320
00:20:03,312 --> 00:20:05,186
It's funny, now I think of it, but,

321
00:20:05,501 --> 00:20:08,940
in all these years not one
of you has asked my first name.

322
00:20:11,324 --> 00:20:12,569
It's Mercy.

323
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:17,389
Doctor!

324
00:20:18,436 --> 00:20:19,597
I thought you were dead!

325
00:20:20,149 --> 00:20:22,149
Now then, Rosita.
A little decorum.

326
00:20:22,822 --> 00:20:24,273
You've been gone for so long.

327
00:20:24,544 --> 00:20:28,432
He's always doing this,
leaving me behind. Going frantic.

328
00:20:28,532 --> 00:20:31,087
- What about the TARDIS?
- Oh, she's ready. Come on.

329
00:20:32,178 --> 00:20:33,901
I'm looking forward to this.

330
00:20:34,791 --> 00:20:36,286
You were right though, Rosita.

331
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:39,756
The Reverend Fairchild's death
was the work of the Cybermen.

332
00:20:40,381 --> 00:20:41,718
So, you live here?

333
00:20:41,965 --> 00:20:45,109
A temporary base,
until we rout the enemy.

334
00:20:45,531 --> 00:20:47,954
The TARDIS is magnificent,
but it's hardly a home.

335
00:20:48,054 --> 00:20:51,049
- And where's the TARDIS now?
- In the yard.

336
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:55,392
Er... What's all this luggage?

337
00:20:55,492 --> 00:20:59,794
Evidence. The property of Jackson Lake,
the first man to be murdered.

338
00:21:00,804 --> 00:21:04,791
Oh, but my new friend is a fighter,
Rosita, much like myself.

339
00:21:05,031 --> 00:21:07,211
He faced the Cybermen with a cutlass.

340
00:21:08,951 --> 00:21:11,529
I'm not ashamed to say,
he was braver than I.

341
00:21:13,758 --> 00:21:14,976
He was quite brilliant.

342
00:21:18,253 --> 00:21:19,458
Are you whistling again?

343
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:23,338
Yes. Yes, I am, yeah. Yeah.

344
00:21:31,934 --> 00:21:33,789
That's another man's property.

345
00:21:34,073 --> 00:21:36,249
Well, a dead man's.

346
00:21:38,510 --> 00:21:39,835
How did you two meet, then?

347
00:21:40,441 --> 00:21:41,671
He saved my life.

348
00:21:43,721 --> 00:21:46,050
Late one night, by the Osterman's Wharf,

349
00:21:46,870 --> 00:21:47,734
this...

350
00:21:48,489 --> 00:21:50,990
creature came out of the shadows.

351
00:21:51,690 --> 00:21:53,173
A man made of metal.

352
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:56,968
I thought I was gonna die.

353
00:21:58,223 --> 00:21:59,107
And then,

354
00:21:59,958 --> 00:22:00,873
there he was.

355
00:22:02,230 --> 00:22:03,113
The Doctor.

356
00:22:06,130 --> 00:22:07,341
Can you help him, sir?

357
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:10,155
He has such terrible dreams.

358
00:22:10,698 --> 00:22:11,726
Wakes at night

359
00:22:12,433 --> 00:22:13,909
in such a state of terror.

360
00:22:14,534 --> 00:22:15,543
Come now, Rosita.

361
00:22:16,952 --> 00:22:19,092
With all the things
a Time Lord has seen,

362
00:22:19,192 --> 00:22:22,799
everything he's lost,
he may surely have bad dreams.

363
00:22:24,471 --> 00:22:25,329
Yeah.

364
00:22:29,904 --> 00:22:32,189
Oh, now, look.

365
00:22:34,484 --> 00:22:36,308
Jackson Lake had an infostamp.

366
00:22:36,535 --> 00:22:37,547
But how?

367
00:22:38,228 --> 00:22:39,193
Is that significant?

368
00:22:39,705 --> 00:22:42,380
Doctor, the answer to all this
is in your TARDIS.

369
00:22:43,257 --> 00:22:46,140
- Can I see it?
- Mr Smith, it would be my honour.

370
00:22:51,467 --> 00:22:52,647
There she is!

371
00:22:53,536 --> 00:22:56,136
My transport through time and space.

372
00:22:58,174 --> 00:22:59,309
The TARDIS.

373
00:23:00,067 --> 00:23:02,136
You've got a balloon.

374
00:23:03,455 --> 00:23:06,189
TARDIS. T-A-R-D-I-S.

375
00:23:06,289 --> 00:23:10,332
It stands for Tethered Aerial
Release Developed In Style.

376
00:23:10,432 --> 00:23:11,169
D'you see?

377
00:23:12,729 --> 00:23:14,504
Well, I do now.

378
00:23:15,286 --> 00:23:17,974
I like it. Good TARDIS.

379
00:23:19,828 --> 00:23:23,015
Brilliant. Nice one.
And is it inflated by gas, yeah?

380
00:23:23,115 --> 00:23:26,309
We're adjacent to the Mutton Street
Gasworks, I pay them a modest fee.

381
00:23:26,578 --> 00:23:29,189
- Good work, Jed.
- Glad to be of service, sir.

382
00:23:31,903 --> 00:23:33,235
You've got quite a bit of money.

383
00:23:33,587 --> 00:23:35,254
Oh, you get nothing for nothing.

384
00:23:35,791 --> 00:23:38,755
- How's that ripped panel, Jed?
- All repaired, should work a treat.

385
00:23:38,855 --> 00:23:41,053
You never know,
maybe tonight's the night, Doctor.

386
00:23:41,936 --> 00:23:42,737
Imagine it,

387
00:23:43,324 --> 00:23:45,040
seeing Christmas from above.

388
00:23:46,927 --> 00:23:48,584
Well, not just yet, I think.

389
00:23:49,146 --> 00:23:50,862
One day, I will ascend.

390
00:23:51,392 --> 00:23:52,483
One day soon.

391
00:23:54,470 --> 00:23:55,833
You've never actually been up?

392
00:23:56,395 --> 00:23:59,039
He dreams of leaving,
but never does.

393
00:23:59,367 --> 00:24:03,014
I can depart, in the TARDIS,
once London is safe.

394
00:24:04,812 --> 00:24:06,610
And finally, when I'm up there...

395
00:24:07,632 --> 00:24:08,822
Think of it, John.

396
00:24:09,894 --> 00:24:11,421
The time and the space.

397
00:24:13,194 --> 00:24:14,696
The perfect escape.

398
00:24:17,692 --> 00:24:19,669
Do you ever wonder
what you're escaping from?

399
00:24:21,706 --> 00:24:23,012
With every moment.

400
00:24:23,788 --> 00:24:25,283
Then do you want me to tell you?

401
00:24:26,968 --> 00:24:28,694
Cos I think I've worked it out now.

402
00:24:30,328 --> 00:24:31,963
How you became The Doctor.

403
00:24:33,464 --> 00:24:34,499
What do you think?

404
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:37,168
Do you want to know?

405
00:24:41,217 --> 00:24:44,643
Mr Cole, Mr Scoones,
Mr Fetch and Mr Milligan,

406
00:24:45,305 --> 00:24:48,693
you have your instructions and
the Court of the CyberKing is waiting.

407
00:24:49,307 --> 00:24:51,509
First of all, let's just see.

408
00:24:52,278 --> 00:24:53,496
A little test.

409
00:24:54,499 --> 00:24:55,465
Turn right.

410
00:24:57,515 --> 00:24:58,449
Turn left.

411
00:25:01,211 --> 00:25:02,523
And face me.

412
00:25:04,510 --> 00:25:06,176
Oh, I could do this forever.

413
00:25:06,782 --> 00:25:07,564
But now,

414
00:25:08,201 --> 00:25:10,182
set about your appointed tasks.

415
00:25:11,357 --> 00:25:12,669
And bring them to me.

416
00:25:26,307 --> 00:25:28,509
The story begins with the Cybermen.

417
00:25:29,263 --> 00:25:30,694
A long time away,

418
00:25:30,952 --> 00:25:34,208
and not so far from here,
the Cybermen were fought

419
00:25:35,623 --> 00:25:36,589
and they were beaten.

420
00:25:37,181 --> 00:25:40,470
And they were sent into a howling
wilderness called The Void,

421
00:25:41,205 --> 00:25:42,989
locked inside forevermore.

422
00:25:43,498 --> 00:25:45,290
But then a greater battle rose up,

423
00:25:46,867 --> 00:25:49,498
so great that everything
inside The Void perished.

424
00:25:50,661 --> 00:25:52,958
But, as the walls of the world weakened,

425
00:25:54,049 --> 00:25:57,271
the last of the Cybermen must have
fallen through the dimensions,

426
00:25:57,371 --> 00:25:58,375
back in time,

427
00:25:59,229 --> 00:26:00,356
to land here.

428
00:26:00,991 --> 00:26:04,044
- And they found you.
- I fought them, I know that.

429
00:26:05,723 --> 00:26:06,669
But what happened?

430
00:26:07,217 --> 00:26:09,376
At the same time,
another man came to London.

431
00:26:10,417 --> 00:26:11,749
Mr Jackson Lake.

432
00:26:12,682 --> 00:26:14,802
Plenty of luggage,
money in his pocket. Maybe...

433
00:26:16,007 --> 00:26:18,184
coming to town for the winter season,
I don't know.

434
00:26:19,906 --> 00:26:21,610
But he found the Cybermen too.

435
00:26:23,030 --> 00:26:24,203
And just like you,

436
00:26:25,181 --> 00:26:26,342
exactly like you,

437
00:26:27,945 --> 00:26:29,711
he took hold of an infostamp.

438
00:26:30,834 --> 00:26:31,919
But he's dead.

439
00:26:32,184 --> 00:26:34,671
Jackson Lake is dead.
The Cybermen murdered him.

440
00:26:34,903 --> 00:26:36,701
You said no body was ever found.

441
00:26:37,819 --> 00:26:39,111
And you kept all his suitcases,

442
00:26:39,211 --> 00:26:41,289
but you could never bring
yourself to open them.

443
00:26:43,654 --> 00:26:46,306
I told you the answer
was in the fob watch.

444
00:26:47,965 --> 00:26:48,949
Can I see?

445
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:03,629
JL.

446
00:27:05,780 --> 00:27:07,395
The watch is Jackson Lake's.

447
00:27:09,547 --> 00:27:10,869
Jackson Lake is...

448
00:27:11,446 --> 00:27:12,500
you, sir?

449
00:27:14,385 --> 00:27:15,552
But I'm The Doctor.

450
00:27:17,918 --> 00:27:19,332
You became The Doctor

451
00:27:20,265 --> 00:27:25,237
because the infostamp you picked up
was a book about one particular man.

452
00:27:28,077 --> 00:27:29,680
The Cybermen's database.

453
00:27:32,281 --> 00:27:34,300
Stolen from the Daleks
inside The Void, I'd say,

454
00:27:34,609 --> 00:27:36,509
but it's everything
you could want to know

455
00:27:37,650 --> 00:27:38,829
about The Doctor.

456
00:27:43,399 --> 00:27:44,144
That's you.

457
00:27:46,074 --> 00:27:48,573
Time Lord, TARDIS,
enemy of the Cybermen.

458
00:27:50,346 --> 00:27:51,529
The one and the only.

459
00:27:55,261 --> 00:27:56,125
You see?

460
00:27:56,408 --> 00:27:58,813
The infostamp must have backfired,

461
00:28:00,112 --> 00:28:02,517
streamed all that information about me

462
00:28:03,514 --> 00:28:05,060
right inside your head.

463
00:28:22,095 --> 00:28:23,602
I am nothing but a lie.

464
00:28:23,962 --> 00:28:27,549
No, no, no, no, no. Infostamps
are just facts and figures.

465
00:28:28,239 --> 00:28:29,425
All that bravery,

466
00:28:30,201 --> 00:28:32,574
saving Rosita,
defending London town.

467
00:28:33,577 --> 00:28:37,522
Hmm? And the invention,
building a TARDIS. That's all you.

468
00:28:38,052 --> 00:28:39,143
And what else?

469
00:28:42,361 --> 00:28:43,856
Tell me what else?

470
00:28:45,533 --> 00:28:47,421
There's still something missing,
isn't there?

471
00:28:47,521 --> 00:28:49,069
I demand you tell me, sir.

472
00:28:50,253 --> 00:28:51,931
Tell me what they took.

473
00:28:56,230 --> 00:28:56,980
Sorry.

474
00:28:59,226 --> 00:29:00,753
Really, I am so sorry.

475
00:29:03,416 --> 00:29:05,917
But that's an awful lot
of luggage for one man.

476
00:29:09,274 --> 00:29:13,228
Cos an infostamp is plain technology.
Not enough to make a man lose his mind.

477
00:29:14,504 --> 00:29:16,929
What you suffered
is called a fugue.

478
00:29:18,529 --> 00:29:19,864
A fugue state.

479
00:29:20,987 --> 00:29:24,169
Where the mind just runs away,
because it can't bear to look back.

480
00:29:27,565 --> 00:29:29,609
You wanted to become someone else,

481
00:29:31,514 --> 00:29:33,811
because Jackson Lake
had lost so much.

482
00:29:38,781 --> 00:29:39,752
Midnight.

483
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:42,295
Christmas Day.

484
00:29:45,529 --> 00:29:46,670
I remember...

485
00:29:50,222 --> 00:29:51,654
Oh, my God...

486
00:30:01,525 --> 00:30:02,686
Caroline.

487
00:30:08,156 --> 00:30:09,532
They killed my wife.

488
00:30:14,329 --> 00:30:15,822
They killed her.

489
00:30:37,185 --> 00:30:38,230
Oh...

490
00:30:39,599 --> 00:30:42,659
- You found a whole cache of infostamps.
- But what is it?

491
00:30:43,151 --> 00:30:44,274
What's that noise?

492
00:30:44,689 --> 00:30:48,369
Activation. A call to arms.
The Cybermen are moving!

493
00:31:00,249 --> 00:31:01,650
The Doctor needs help.

494
00:31:03,145 --> 00:31:04,666
I learnt that much about him.

495
00:31:05,593 --> 00:31:07,284
There should be someone at his side.

496
00:31:08,476 --> 00:31:09,296
Now go.

497
00:31:10,999 --> 00:31:11,709
Go.

498
00:31:23,181 --> 00:31:24,815
What is it? What's happening?

499
00:31:31,723 --> 00:31:34,985
That's Mr Cole. He's Master
of the Hazel Street Workhouse.

500
00:31:35,529 --> 00:31:38,890
- Maybe he's taking them to prayers.
- Oh, nothing as holy as that.

501
00:31:39,363 --> 00:31:40,430
Can you hear me?

502
00:31:41,289 --> 00:31:42,269
Hello?

503
00:31:43,657 --> 00:31:44,471
No?

504
00:31:45,089 --> 00:31:47,709
Mr Cole, you seem to have
something in your ear.

505
00:31:48,017 --> 00:31:50,209
Now, this might hurt a bit,
but if I can just...

506
00:31:52,325 --> 00:31:53,429
They're on guard.

507
00:31:54,294 --> 00:31:56,083
Can't risk a fight.
Not with the children.

508
00:31:56,319 --> 00:31:57,420
But where are they going?

509
00:31:57,520 --> 00:31:59,459
All need a good whipping,
if you ask me.

510
00:31:59,559 --> 00:32:03,478
I've just seen another lot
coming from the Ingleby Workhouse.

511
00:32:03,578 --> 00:32:04,898
- Where's that?
- This way!

512
00:32:16,575 --> 00:32:17,869
Dozens of 'em!

513
00:32:18,442 --> 00:32:19,569
But what for?

514
00:32:55,329 --> 00:32:56,683
You will continue.

515
00:32:57,207 --> 00:32:59,257
You will enter
the Court of the CyberKing.

516
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:05,589
March.

517
00:33:06,057 --> 00:33:07,452
That is an order.

518
00:33:08,272 --> 00:33:09,237
March!

519
00:33:35,294 --> 00:33:36,391
Where is it?

520
00:33:41,338 --> 00:33:42,423
Where is it?

521
00:33:45,726 --> 00:33:47,137
That's the door to the sluice.

522
00:33:47,237 --> 00:33:49,604
All the sewage runs through there,
straight into the Thames.

523
00:33:49,704 --> 00:33:52,863
Yeah, that's too well guarded.
We'll have to find another way in.

524
00:33:53,235 --> 00:33:55,949
Whoa! That's cheating, sneaking up!

525
00:33:56,474 --> 00:33:58,114
Did you have your legs on silent?

526
00:33:58,884 --> 00:33:59,553
So...

527
00:34:00,329 --> 00:34:01,427
what do we have here?

528
00:34:01,527 --> 00:34:03,888
Just walk towards me, slowly.
Don't let them touch you.

529
00:34:03,988 --> 00:34:07,189
Oh, but they wouldn't hurt me,
my fine boys.

530
00:34:07,634 --> 00:34:09,925
They are my knights
in shining armour.

531
00:34:10,190 --> 00:34:11,206
Quite literally.

532
00:34:11,306 --> 00:34:13,989
Even if they've converted you,
that's not a Cyber speech pattern.

533
00:34:14,089 --> 00:34:16,468
You've still got free will.
Step away...

534
00:34:16,568 --> 00:34:18,189
There's been no conversion, sir.

535
00:34:18,845 --> 00:34:20,709
No-one's ever been able
to change my mind.

536
00:34:20,809 --> 00:34:25,021
The Cybermen offered me the one
thing I wanted: liberation.

537
00:34:25,324 --> 00:34:27,109
- Who are you?
- You can be quiet.

538
00:34:27,728 --> 00:34:31,293
I doubt he paid you to talk.
More importantly, who are you, sir?

539
00:34:31,393 --> 00:34:34,151
With such intimate knowledge
of my companions.

540
00:34:34,321 --> 00:34:35,429
I'm The Doctor.

541
00:34:35,529 --> 00:34:39,511
Incorrect. You do not correspond
to our image of The Doctor.

542
00:34:39,776 --> 00:34:43,308
Yeah, that's cos your database got
corrupted. Oh, look, look, look!

543
00:34:43,586 --> 00:34:45,668
Check this! The Doctor's infostamp.

544
00:34:48,053 --> 00:34:49,479
Plug it in. Go on, download.

545
00:34:50,078 --> 00:34:51,750
The core has been damaged.

546
00:34:51,929 --> 00:34:54,789
This infostamp would
damage Cyberunits.

547
00:34:54,889 --> 00:34:56,242
Oh, well. Nice try.

548
00:34:57,705 --> 00:34:59,529
Core repaired. Download.

549
00:35:10,123 --> 00:35:12,189
- You are The Doctor.
- Hello!

550
00:35:12,289 --> 00:35:13,638
You will be deleted.

551
00:35:13,738 --> 00:35:18,029
Oh, but let me die happy! Tell me:
what d'you need those children for?

552
00:35:18,129 --> 00:35:19,864
What are children ever needed for?

553
00:35:20,085 --> 00:35:21,949
- They're a workforce.
- But for what?

554
00:35:22,310 --> 00:35:24,677
Very soon now,
the whole Empire will see.

555
00:35:24,777 --> 00:35:26,768
And they will bow down, in worship.

556
00:35:26,868 --> 00:35:28,642
And it's all been timed
for Christmas Day.

557
00:35:28,742 --> 00:35:30,063
Was that your idea, Miss...?

558
00:35:30,163 --> 00:35:31,967
Hartigan. Yes.

559
00:35:32,239 --> 00:35:35,466
The perfect day for a birth,
with a new message for the people.

560
00:35:35,996 --> 00:35:38,128
Only this time, it won't be
the words of a man.

561
00:35:38,551 --> 00:35:39,589
The birth of what?

562
00:35:40,084 --> 00:35:41,380
A birth, and a death.

563
00:35:41,850 --> 00:35:42,829
Namely, yours.

564
00:35:43,415 --> 00:35:44,768
Thank you, Doctor.

565
00:35:45,096 --> 00:35:47,778
I'm glad to have been part
of your very last conversation.

566
00:35:48,626 --> 00:35:51,434
- Now, delete them.
- Delete!

567
00:36:06,008 --> 00:36:08,096
- At your service, Doctor.
- Shade!

568
00:36:08,418 --> 00:36:09,812
Sha-a-a-a-a-ade!

569
00:36:09,912 --> 00:36:11,447
- Run! Come on!
- Sha-a-a-a-ade!

570
00:36:11,547 --> 00:36:12,759
One last thing.

571
00:36:13,349 --> 00:36:14,191
Oh!

572
00:36:14,753 --> 00:36:16,532
Can I say, I completely disapprove!

573
00:36:16,632 --> 00:36:18,109
- Come on!
- Get off me.

574
00:36:18,209 --> 00:36:19,493
I said, get off!

575
00:36:20,722 --> 00:36:23,909
Tell your masters,
we're not waiting till dawn.

576
00:36:24,274 --> 00:36:26,349
The CyberKing will rise...

577
00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:29,575
...tonight!

578
00:36:32,483 --> 00:36:34,895
That stronghold down by the river.
I need to find a way in.

579
00:36:34,995 --> 00:36:36,117
I'm ahead of you!

580
00:36:36,534 --> 00:36:39,936
My wife and I were moving to London so I
could take up a post at the university.

581
00:36:40,036 --> 00:36:42,886
And while my memory
is still not intact, this...

582
00:36:43,543 --> 00:36:45,909
this was in the luggage.
The deeds:

583
00:36:46,275 --> 00:36:47,878
15 Latimer Street.

584
00:36:47,978 --> 00:36:50,364
If I discovered the Cybermen there,
in the cellar, then...

585
00:36:50,464 --> 00:36:53,029
- That might be a way in! Brilliant!
- But there's still more.

586
00:36:53,759 --> 00:36:55,121
I remember the cellar...

587
00:36:56,099 --> 00:36:57,342
and my wife.

588
00:37:00,099 --> 00:37:02,715
But I swear there was
something else in that room.

589
00:37:07,421 --> 00:37:11,501
If we can find that, perhaps that's
the key to defeating these invaders.

590
00:37:11,898 --> 00:37:13,629
So... onwards!

591
00:37:14,005 --> 00:37:16,094
- Maybe you should go back...
- Don't even try!

592
00:37:16,194 --> 00:37:16,983
No.

593
00:37:17,752 --> 00:37:18,949
You have wisdom.

594
00:37:19,049 --> 00:37:21,386
If The Doctor is planning to intervene,

595
00:37:21,486 --> 00:37:24,068
then the Ascension
will commence immediately.

596
00:37:24,168 --> 00:37:24,989
Excellent.

597
00:37:25,979 --> 00:37:30,058
And as for you, Mr Cole, Mr Scoones,
Mr Fetch and Mr Milligan,

598
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:32,398
your work is done.

599
00:37:48,489 --> 00:37:49,560
Children!

600
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:51,434
Pay attention!

601
00:37:52,544 --> 00:37:55,667
Now let the new
Industrial Revolution begin.

602
00:37:56,462 --> 00:37:57,756
I want to see you work!

603
00:38:30,258 --> 00:38:33,384
Energy levels 60% and rising.

604
00:38:34,084 --> 00:38:37,029
Soon the CyberKing will awake.

605
00:38:37,129 --> 00:38:38,160
Then show me.

606
00:38:46,359 --> 00:38:47,098
Delete!

607
00:38:53,258 --> 00:38:54,697
Must've been guarding this.

608
00:38:55,133 --> 00:38:57,498
A Dimension Vault!
Stolen from the Daleks again,

609
00:38:57,649 --> 00:39:00,482
that's how the Cybermen travelled
through time. Jackson, is this it ?

610
00:39:00,582 --> 00:39:02,022
the thing you couldn't remember?

611
00:39:02,384 --> 00:39:03,580
I don't think so.

612
00:39:04,110 --> 00:39:05,749
I'm... I just can't see.

613
00:39:06,533 --> 00:39:08,988
- It's like it's hidden.
- Not enough power. Come on!

614
00:39:09,088 --> 00:39:09,940
Avanti!

615
00:39:14,048 --> 00:39:15,998
Oh, that is magnificent.

616
00:39:20,187 --> 00:39:21,934
That is royalty, indeed.

617
00:39:22,338 --> 00:39:23,696
And that's quite a throne.

618
00:39:23,796 --> 00:39:25,528
Oh, you will look resplendent.

619
00:39:25,872 --> 00:39:29,669
The chair you designate as "throne"
is not intended for me.

620
00:39:29,777 --> 00:39:34,497
My function is to serve the CyberKing,
not to become the CyberKing.

621
00:39:35,033 --> 00:39:36,309
Then who sits there?

622
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:45,860
No! Now, just...
I think if you remember correctly...

623
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:47,487
you said I was to be heralded.

624
00:39:47,587 --> 00:39:49,652
All hail the CyberKing.

625
00:39:49,752 --> 00:39:51,558
"All hail the CyberKing."

626
00:39:51,658 --> 00:39:53,989
But you promised
I would never be converted!

627
00:39:54,089 --> 00:39:56,753
That was designated a "lie".

628
00:39:56,853 --> 00:39:58,236
What do the Cybermen want?

629
00:39:58,336 --> 00:39:59,464
They want us.

630
00:39:59,787 --> 00:40:03,725
That's what Cybermen are: human beings
with their brains put into metal shells.

631
00:40:03,939 --> 00:40:05,948
They want every living thing
to be like them.

632
00:40:06,895 --> 00:40:08,585
You can't do this to me!

633
00:40:09,053 --> 00:40:11,078
Incorrect. It is done.

634
00:40:11,576 --> 00:40:13,559
But I would have served you anyway!

635
00:40:13,659 --> 00:40:17,249
Your mind is riven with anger
and abuse and revenge.

636
00:40:17,596 --> 00:40:21,167
These have no place in a Cybermind.
Activate!

637
00:40:23,684 --> 00:40:26,719
Emotions have tormented you
all of your life.

638
00:40:27,034 --> 00:40:30,933
Now you will be set free.
This is your liberation.

639
00:40:31,337 --> 00:40:33,481
For the love of God!
Have you no pity?

640
00:40:35,159 --> 00:40:35,999
Correct.

641
00:40:45,873 --> 00:40:48,057
A CyberKing is born.

642
00:40:48,157 --> 00:40:50,559
"All hail the CyberKing."

643
00:41:12,089 --> 00:41:14,152
- 'Pon my soul...
- What is it?

644
00:41:15,048 --> 00:41:16,052
It's an engine.

645
00:41:29,170 --> 00:41:31,499
They're generating electricity.
But what for?

646
00:41:31,659 --> 00:41:32,861
We can set them free!

647
00:41:33,201 --> 00:41:34,479
No, no, no, no, no, no, no...

648
00:41:43,224 --> 00:41:44,927
Behold, such...

649
00:41:45,482 --> 00:41:46,753
information!

650
00:41:50,506 --> 00:41:51,897
Power at 90%!

651
00:41:51,997 --> 00:41:55,575
But if we stop the engine, the power
dies down, Cybermen will come running.

652
00:41:56,597 --> 00:41:59,178
Hold on. Power fluctuation.
That's not meant to happen.

653
00:41:59,462 --> 00:42:02,017
- It's going wrong?
- No, it's weird.

654
00:42:02,547 --> 00:42:04,419
The software's rewriting itself.

655
00:42:05,455 --> 00:42:06,324
It's changing.

656
00:42:06,911 --> 00:42:09,946
I can see the stars, the worlds beyond,

657
00:42:10,488 --> 00:42:14,259
the Vortex of Time itself
and the whole of infinity.

658
00:42:14,488 --> 00:42:16,186
Oh, but this is glorious!

659
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:19,766
That is incorrect.
"Glorious" is an emotional response.

660
00:42:19,961 --> 00:42:23,349
Exactly! There is so much joy
in this machine.

661
00:42:23,501 --> 00:42:25,368
Joy is not acceptable.

662
00:42:25,570 --> 00:42:26,674
Don't you see?

663
00:42:27,223 --> 00:42:29,387
My mind is stronger
than you ever thought!

664
00:42:29,487 --> 00:42:32,693
It dominates, sir!
It dominates you!

665
00:42:32,793 --> 00:42:36,102
Alert! You are operating beyond
the standard parameters.

666
00:42:36,202 --> 00:42:40,929
I am new.The might of your technology
combined with my own imagination.

667
00:42:41,029 --> 00:42:41,851
Yes!

668
00:42:42,582 --> 00:42:46,419
There will be a new race
of Cybermen. MY Cybermen!

669
00:42:46,519 --> 00:42:50,115
Logic and strength combined
with fury and passion!

670
00:42:50,316 --> 00:42:52,329
Diagnosis system failure!

671
00:42:52,575 --> 00:42:54,525
You will be removed
from the processor.

672
00:43:02,819 --> 00:43:05,251
Whoa! What the hell's happening?
It's out of control!

673
00:43:05,351 --> 00:43:06,253
It's accelerating.

674
00:43:06,638 --> 00:43:08,071
96%, 97...

675
00:43:08,171 --> 00:43:10,994
When it reaches 100,
what about the children?

676
00:43:11,094 --> 00:43:12,822
They're disposable. Come on!

677
00:43:16,356 --> 00:43:18,021
I am CyberKing.

678
00:43:18,774 --> 00:43:21,222
My mind inside the Cybermen.

679
00:43:22,175 --> 00:43:23,664
And you will obey me!

680
00:43:24,099 --> 00:43:26,270
"All hail the CyberKing!"

681
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:30,739
Power levels now at 100%.

682
00:43:30,839 --> 00:43:32,479
Delete the workforce.

683
00:43:34,344 --> 00:43:35,013
Delete.

684
00:43:37,107 --> 00:43:38,091
Delete.

685
00:43:39,395 --> 00:43:40,339
Delete.

686
00:43:41,496 --> 00:43:43,979
Right. Now! All of you, out!

687
00:43:45,137 --> 00:43:46,339
That's an order!

688
00:43:46,499 --> 00:43:48,444
Every single one of you, run!

689
00:43:48,544 --> 00:43:50,794
All of you, come on!
As fast as you can, come on!

690
00:43:51,523 --> 00:43:53,555
There's a hot pie for everyone,
if you leg it!

691
00:43:53,776 --> 00:43:54,527
Go!

692
00:43:55,044 --> 00:43:56,338
Get them out of the sluice gate!

693
00:43:56,438 --> 00:43:58,772
Once you're out, keep running!
Far as you can!

694
00:44:01,019 --> 00:44:03,006
Come on, come on, come on.

695
00:44:09,133 --> 00:44:10,319
Turn right at the corner!

696
00:44:10,495 --> 00:44:12,659
Fast as you can, and don't stop!

697
00:44:13,041 --> 00:44:15,275
Keep running, keep running!

698
00:44:15,716 --> 00:44:17,099
Come, my soldiers.

699
00:44:17,344 --> 00:44:18,366
Come to me.

700
00:44:23,269 --> 00:44:25,039
Come on, come on!

701
00:44:26,153 --> 00:44:27,839
Keep running! Keep running!

702
00:44:34,788 --> 00:44:36,199
Go! Quick, quick.

703
00:44:39,223 --> 00:44:41,879
It's some sort of starter motor,
but starting what?

704
00:45:00,583 --> 00:45:01,744
No!

705
00:45:06,346 --> 00:45:07,979
Help!

706
00:45:12,790 --> 00:45:15,118
Father!

707
00:45:20,519 --> 00:45:23,808
Father! Father...

708
00:45:23,908 --> 00:45:25,419
That's my son...

709
00:45:28,123 --> 00:45:29,284
My son.

710
00:45:30,262 --> 00:45:31,726
- Doctor, my son!
- What?!

711
00:45:32,677 --> 00:45:33,883
They took my son.

712
00:45:34,229 --> 00:45:37,384
No wonder my mind escaped!
Those damned Cybermen took my child.

713
00:45:37,586 --> 00:45:39,676
But he's alive, Doctor! Frederic!

714
00:45:39,776 --> 00:45:40,749
Come on!

715
00:45:41,285 --> 00:45:42,580
No, he's too scared.

716
00:45:42,680 --> 00:45:45,759
Stay there! Don't move! I'm coming.

717
00:45:47,405 --> 00:45:50,003
CyberKing rising.

718
00:45:57,259 --> 00:45:59,154
I can't get up there. Fred!

719
00:45:59,254 --> 00:46:01,348
They've finished the motor.
It's going to blow up.

720
00:46:01,448 --> 00:46:03,233
What are we going to do, Doctor?!

721
00:46:03,333 --> 00:46:04,538
Come on, Jackson.

722
00:46:09,025 --> 00:46:10,129
You know me.

723
00:46:16,552 --> 00:46:18,719
Oh, that's it. Hello!

724
00:46:18,819 --> 00:46:21,179
Now, hold on tight. Don't let go.

725
00:46:44,922 --> 00:46:46,152
Merry Christmas!

726
00:46:51,991 --> 00:46:55,119
Go to St Stephen's. Ask for the
Warden, he'll take care of you.

727
00:46:55,726 --> 00:46:57,339
Now run! Quickly!

728
00:47:11,248 --> 00:47:14,065
It's under the water!
There's something in the Thames!

729
00:47:25,240 --> 00:47:26,363
Head for the street.

730
00:47:29,779 --> 00:47:32,254
- Come on, Doctor! Hurry up!
- Gotcha!

731
00:47:37,717 --> 00:47:39,904
Behold! I am risen!

732
00:47:40,687 --> 00:47:44,539
Witness me, mankind,
as CyberKing of all!

733
00:47:47,769 --> 00:47:49,094
It's a CyberKing.

734
00:47:49,750 --> 00:47:50,855
And a CyberKing is what?

735
00:47:50,955 --> 00:47:52,343
It's a ship! Dreadnought class!

736
00:47:52,501 --> 00:47:53,879
Front line of an invasion.

737
00:47:54,072 --> 00:47:56,089
And inside the chest,
a Cyberfactory,

738
00:47:56,189 --> 00:47:57,919
ready to convert millions!

739
00:47:58,408 --> 00:47:59,779
And I will walk!

740
00:48:00,376 --> 00:48:05,499
I will stride across
this tiny little world!

741
00:48:20,418 --> 00:48:21,509
My people.

742
00:48:23,030 --> 00:48:24,708
Why do they not rejoice?

743
00:48:33,553 --> 00:48:35,688
Take him south, go to the parkland.

744
00:48:35,788 --> 00:48:37,159
- Where're you going?
- Stop that thing.

745
00:48:37,259 --> 00:48:38,244
I should be with you!

746
00:48:38,344 --> 00:48:41,022
Jackson, you've got your son.
You've got a reason to live.

747
00:48:41,122 --> 00:48:42,068
And you haven't?

748
00:48:46,617 --> 00:48:48,142
God save you, Doctor.

749
00:49:05,992 --> 00:49:10,408
- What the hell is that thing, sir?
- Oh, good man. Jed, wasn't it?

750
00:49:10,667 --> 00:49:12,780
- Jed, I need your help!
- I'm not going out there!

751
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:14,490
I'll give you five pound notes!

752
00:49:15,916 --> 00:49:18,390
Um... All right.
What d'you want me to do?

753
00:49:18,490 --> 00:49:20,351
The TARDIS is gonna fly!

754
00:49:27,436 --> 00:49:29,929
People of the world! Now hear me.

755
00:49:30,774 --> 00:49:33,222
Your governments will surrender.

756
00:49:34,465 --> 00:49:35,519
And if not,

757
00:49:36,307 --> 00:49:38,259
then behold my power!

758
00:49:58,687 --> 00:50:01,601
- You're flamin' bonkers, sir!
- It's been said before! Now gimme.

759
00:50:01,961 --> 00:50:03,426
Not enough power, come on!

760
00:50:03,526 --> 00:50:04,859
Jed! Let her loose!

761
00:50:06,737 --> 00:50:09,568
- Ever flown one of these before?
- Nope! Never!

762
00:50:11,243 --> 00:50:13,401
- Can I have my money now?
- Oh, get on with it!

763
00:50:19,499 --> 00:50:23,693
- Oh, sir. I thought I'd lost you.
- My son, Rosita. This boy is my son.

764
00:50:40,206 --> 00:50:42,068
Good luck to you, sir!

765
00:50:49,300 --> 00:50:52,764
It's the TARDIS. She's flying!

766
00:51:05,270 --> 00:51:08,122
- Who the 'ell is that?!
- His name, sir...

767
00:51:10,130 --> 00:51:11,480
..is The Doctor!

768
00:51:19,539 --> 00:51:22,199
Attention. Proximity alert!

769
00:51:22,299 --> 00:51:23,774
How is that even possible?

770
00:51:24,550 --> 00:51:27,017
Oh, this I would see. TURN!

771
00:51:44,538 --> 00:51:46,733
Excellent. The Doctor!

772
00:51:47,244 --> 00:51:50,310
Yet another man come to assert
himself against me in the night.

773
00:51:50,733 --> 00:51:51,959
Miss Hartigan!

774
00:51:52,470 --> 00:51:53,839
I'm offering you a choice.

775
00:51:54,287 --> 00:51:58,041
You might have the most remarkable
mind this world has ever seen.

776
00:51:58,401 --> 00:52:00,879
Strong enough to control
the Cybermen themselves!

777
00:52:01,145 --> 00:52:03,150
I don't need you to sanction me.

778
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:06,279
No, but such a mind
deserves to live!

779
00:52:06,671 --> 00:52:09,399
The Cybermen came to this world
using a Dimension Vault.

780
00:52:09,648 --> 00:52:13,919
I can use that device to find you
a home, with no people to convert,

781
00:52:14,327 --> 00:52:18,639
but a new world where you can live
out your mechanical life in peace.

782
00:52:19,013 --> 00:52:20,579
I have the world below.

783
00:52:21,101 --> 00:52:25,045
And it is abundant with so many minds,
ready to become extensions of me.

784
00:52:25,145 --> 00:52:26,779
Why would I leave this place?

785
00:52:26,987 --> 00:52:28,165
Because if you don't,

786
00:52:28,956 --> 00:52:30,199
I'll have to stop you.

787
00:52:30,776 --> 00:52:33,461
What do you make of me, sir?
An idiot?

788
00:52:34,149 --> 00:52:34,771
No.

789
00:52:36,399 --> 00:52:38,197
The question is,
what do you make of me?

790
00:52:43,656 --> 00:52:44,893
Destroy him!

791
00:52:45,196 --> 00:52:46,584
You make me into this.

792
00:53:05,051 --> 00:53:06,719
Then I have made you a failure.

793
00:53:07,127 --> 00:53:09,398
Your weapons are useless, sir.

794
00:53:09,587 --> 00:53:11,278
I wasn't trying to kill you.

795
00:53:12,382 --> 00:53:14,715
All I did was break
the Cyber-connection,

796
00:53:16,122 --> 00:53:17,567
leaving your mind open.

797
00:53:19,220 --> 00:53:20,046
Open,

798
00:53:21,371 --> 00:53:24,008
I think, for the first time
in far too many years.

799
00:53:25,018 --> 00:53:26,286
So you can see.

800
00:53:28,008 --> 00:53:29,409
Just look at yourself.

801
00:53:29,989 --> 00:53:31,270
Look at what you've done.

802
00:53:32,986 --> 00:53:34,419
I'm sorry, Miss Hartigan.

803
00:53:35,465 --> 00:53:36,872
But look at what you've become.

804
00:53:43,371 --> 00:53:44,399
I'm so sorry.

805
00:54:01,595 --> 00:54:04,402
He's killed it.
Whatever he did, he's killed it!

806
00:54:08,893 --> 00:54:10,154
But it's gonna fall!

807
00:54:32,067 --> 00:54:32,881
Oh!

808
00:54:33,770 --> 00:54:34,805
Now you're ready!

809
00:55:06,081 --> 00:55:07,722
I'd say he used that Dimension Vault

810
00:55:07,822 --> 00:55:10,636
to transfer the wreckage
of the CyberKing into the Time Vortex,

811
00:55:10,819 --> 00:55:12,637
there to be harmlessly disintegrated.

812
00:55:13,350 --> 00:55:15,596
Oh, I've picked up a lot.

813
00:55:16,215 --> 00:55:17,599
But here...

814
00:55:18,070 --> 00:55:19,345
Ladies and gentlemen,

815
00:55:20,196 --> 00:55:21,519
I know that man...

816
00:55:21,938 --> 00:55:23,319
That Doctor on high.

817
00:55:23,774 --> 00:55:27,399
And I know that he has done this
deed a thousand times! But not once.

818
00:55:27,704 --> 00:55:32,050
Not once, no sir, not ever,
has he ever been thanked!

819
00:55:32,713 --> 00:55:37,079
But no more! For I say to you,
on this Christmas morn,

820
00:55:37,325 --> 00:55:41,096
"Bravo, sir! Bravo!"

821
00:55:55,879 --> 00:55:57,259
Bravo, sir!

822
00:56:12,491 --> 00:56:13,746
Bravo, Doctor.

823
00:56:26,539 --> 00:56:29,761
The city will recover,
as London always does.

824
00:56:31,223 --> 00:56:32,998
Though the events of today
will be history,

825
00:56:33,098 --> 00:56:35,767
- spoken of for centuries to come!
- Yeah.

826
00:56:36,575 --> 00:56:37,490
Funny that.

827
00:56:38,285 --> 00:56:40,341
And a new history begins for me.

828
00:56:41,408 --> 00:56:43,875
I find myself a widower,
but with my son

829
00:56:44,600 --> 00:56:45,887
and with a good friend.

830
00:56:46,455 --> 00:56:48,878
Now, take care of that one.
She's marvellous.

831
00:56:49,603 --> 00:56:52,159
Frederic will need a nursemaid
and I can think of none better.

832
00:56:55,510 --> 00:56:56,980
But you're welcome to join us.

833
00:56:57,522 --> 00:57:00,389
We thought we might all dine
together, at the Traveller's Halt.

834
00:57:01,556 --> 00:57:03,480
A Christmas feast, in celebration...

835
00:57:06,319 --> 00:57:08,193
..and in memory
of those we have lost.

836
00:57:12,539 --> 00:57:13,580
You won't stay?

837
00:57:15,750 --> 00:57:16,939
Like I said, "You know me."

838
00:57:19,435 --> 00:57:20,224
No...

839
00:57:21,982 --> 00:57:23,584
I don't think anyone does.

840
00:57:25,256 --> 00:57:25,879
Oh!

841
00:57:26,688 --> 00:57:27,666
And this is it!

842
00:57:28,019 --> 00:57:28,682
Oh!

843
00:57:29,054 --> 00:57:31,639
Oh, if I might, Doctor?
One last adventure?

844
00:57:32,233 --> 00:57:34,372
Oh, be my guest.

845
00:57:40,252 --> 00:57:41,085
Oh...

846
00:57:45,179 --> 00:57:46,523
Oh, my word.

847
00:57:49,596 --> 00:57:51,779
Oh, goodness me.

848
00:57:54,909 --> 00:57:56,006
But this is...

849
00:57:58,215 --> 00:57:59,426
But this is nonsense!

850
00:58:00,890 --> 00:58:02,393
Well, that's one word for it!

851
00:58:03,832 --> 00:58:06,393
Complete and utter,
wonderful nonsense!

852
00:58:06,860 --> 00:58:08,810
How very, very silly!

853
00:58:11,024 --> 00:58:12,894
Oh, no. I can't bear it!

854
00:58:13,714 --> 00:58:15,052
Oh, it's causing my head to ache.

855
00:58:15,152 --> 00:58:17,177
No, no, no, no, no, no, no...

856
00:58:18,149 --> 00:58:19,919
Oh! Oh, gracious.

857
00:58:21,025 --> 00:58:22,054
That's quite enough.

858
00:58:28,338 --> 00:58:29,839
I take it this is goodbye.

859
00:58:30,950 --> 00:58:31,871
Onwards and upwards.

860
00:58:32,597 --> 00:58:33,776
Tell me one thing.

861
00:58:34,703 --> 00:58:37,045
All those facts and figures
I saw of The Doctor's life,

862
00:58:37,145 --> 00:58:38,357
you were never alone.

863
00:58:38,931 --> 00:58:40,956
All those bright
and shining companions!

864
00:58:42,212 --> 00:58:43,486
But not any more?

865
00:58:44,288 --> 00:58:44,900
No.

866
00:58:45,739 --> 00:58:46,699
Might I ask, why not?

867
00:58:47,455 --> 00:58:48,279
They leave.

868
00:58:50,502 --> 00:58:52,780
Because they should.
Or they find someone else.

869
00:58:55,063 --> 00:58:56,514
And some of them, some of them...

870
00:58:58,275 --> 00:58:59,082
forget me.

871
00:59:01,682 --> 00:59:02,969
I suppose, in the end...

872
00:59:09,765 --> 00:59:11,197
..they break my heart.

873
00:59:16,121 --> 00:59:17,635
That offer of Christmas dinner.

874
00:59:17,843 --> 00:59:20,099
It's no longer a request.
It's a demand!

875
00:59:21,761 --> 00:59:23,294
In memory of those we have lost.

876
00:59:27,561 --> 00:59:30,697
- Ohh, go on then!
- Really?!

877
00:59:30,797 --> 00:59:33,539
Just this once. You've actually
gone and changed my mind.

878
00:59:33,639 --> 00:59:34,999
Not many people can do that!

879
00:59:35,845 --> 00:59:36,596
Jackson...

880
00:59:37,835 --> 00:59:40,119
if anyone had to be The Doctor,
I'm glad it was you.

881
00:59:40,989 --> 00:59:44,732
The feast awaits. Come with me!
Walk this way.

882
00:59:44,832 --> 00:59:46,127
I certainly will!

883
00:59:47,477 --> 00:59:49,054
Merry Christmas to you, Jackson.

884
00:59:49,885 --> 00:59:51,629
Merry Christmas, indeed, Doctor!
