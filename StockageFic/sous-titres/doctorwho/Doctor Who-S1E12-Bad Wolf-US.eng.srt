1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,500
The Fourth Great
and Bountiful Human Empire.
Every fact beams out from here.

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:11,000
That's what I call power. 600
channels coming out of Satellite
Five, broadcasting everywhere.

3
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:13,300
This technology's wrong.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,700
Trouble? Oh, yeah.

5
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:19,400
This is not the Fourth Great
and Bountiful Human Empire.

6
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:22,700
Humans are allowed to live here
by kind permission of my client.

7
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,600
Who controls Satellite Five?

8
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:28,600
The Mighty Jagrafess of the
Holy Hadrojassic Maxarodenfoe.

9
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:31,400
You mean that thing's in
charge of Satellite Five?

10
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:34,000
Once you go to Floor
500, you never come back.

11
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:45,300
You'll have to stay and explain
it, no-one's gonna believe me.

12
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:48,300
Oh, they might start
believing a lot of things now.

13
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:51,500
The human race should accelerate.
All back to normal.

14
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:01,900
What is it? What's happening?

15
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:07,600
Oh, my God!

16
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:12,400
I don't believe it, why
did they put you in there?

17
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,400
They never said you were coming!

18
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,900
What happened? I was. . .

19
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,800
Careful now, oh. . .

20
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:19,700
Oh, mind yourself!

21
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:23,900
Oh, that's the transmat,
it scrambles your head.
I was sick for days.

22
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:25,600
You all right?

23
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:29,600
So. . .what's your name,
then, sweetheart?

24
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,000
The Doctor, I think, I was. . .

25
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:33,800
I don't know what happened!

26
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:36,000
You got chosen.

27
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Chosen for what?

28
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,500
You're a housemate! You're in
the house! Isn't that brilliant?

29
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,700
That's not fair, we've got
eviction in five minutes!

30
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:47,900
I've been here for all nine weeks,
I've followed the rules,

31
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,800
I haven't had a single warning,
and he comes swanning in!

32
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:54,000
If they keep changing the rules,
I'm gonna protest, I am.

33
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,400
I'm gonna paint the walls.

34
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:01,500
'Would the Doctor please
come to the Diary Room?'

35
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:17,100
You are live on Channel 44, 000.

36
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:20,400
Please do not swear.
You have GOT to be kidding.

37
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:03,300
Oh. . .

38
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,200
Ah. . .

39
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:08,000
What happened? It's all right.

40
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,800
It's the transmat.

41
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:12,600
It does your head in,
you get a bit of amnesia.

42
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,500
What's your name?

43
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:17,700
Rose. But. . .where's the Doctor?

44
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:20,800
Just remember,
do what the android says.

45
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:23,000
Don't provoke it.

46
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,300
The android's word is law.

47
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:27,700
What do you mean, android?
Like a robot?

48
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:30,600
Positions, everyone, thank you!

49
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:34,000
Come on, hurry up!
The contestants are in place,

50
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:36,100
the cameras. . . Oh, steady!

51
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,800
I was travelling,

52
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:42,600
with the Doctor and a
man called Captain Jack?

53
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:45,000
The Doctor wouldn't just leave me.

54
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,800
That's enough chat!

55
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:49,700
Positions! Final call. Good luck.

56
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:54,100
But I'm not supposed to be here.
It says Rose on the podium.

57
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:56,000
Come on.

58
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:10,600
Hold on. . .

59
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:12,800
I must be going mad.

60
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:19,500
It can't be, this looks like. . .
Android activated!

61
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:22,900
Oh, my God, the android. . .

62
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:26,700
The An. . .droid.

63
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:29,500
Welcome. . .to the Weakest Link!

64
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:32,200
WEAKEST LINKJINGLE

65
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:35,300
Here we go again.
We've got our work cut out for us.

66
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:38,900
I don't know, he's sort of
handsome. Good lantern jaw.

67
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:41,500
Lantern jaws are so last year.

68
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:44,800
Sorry. . . Nice to meet you,
ladies, but where exactly am I?

69
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,400
We're giving you
a brand new image.

70
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,200
Hold on, I was with the Doctor. . .

71
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:52,100
Why, is there something
wrong with what I'm wearing?

72
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:55,800
It's all very 20th century,
where did you get that denim?

73
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:59,600
A little place in Cardiff,
it was called. . .the Top Shop.

74
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:02,500
Ah, design classic!

75
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,900
We're gonna have to
find you some new colours,

76
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
maybe get rid of that Oklahoma
farm boy thing you've got going.

77
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,600
Just stand still and let the
defabricator work its magic.

78
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,100
What's a defabricator?

79
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:25,100
OK, defabricator. Does
exactly what it says on the tin.

80
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,500
Am I naked in front of
millions of viewers?

81
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,100
Absolutely!

82
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:33,600
Ladies. . .your viewing
figures just went up.

83
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:40,200
I can't open it. It's got a deadlock
seal, ever since Big Brother
504 when they all walked out.

84
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:43,200
You must remember that.
What about this?

85
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:47,600
Oh, that's exoglass, you'd need a
nuclear bomb to get through.
Don't tempt me.

86
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:53,800
I know you're not supposed to
talk about the outside world,
but you must've been watching.

87
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:57,100
Do people like me? Lynda, Lynda
with a Y, not Linda with an I,

88
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:01,100
she got forcibly evicted cos she
damaged a camera. Am I popular?

89
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:04,200
I don't remember.
Oh, but does that mean I'm nothing?

90
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:09,000
Some people get this far
just cos they're insignificant.
Doesn't anybody notice me?

91
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,100
No, you're nice, you're. . .sweet.

92
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:16,900
Everybody thinks you're sweet. Oh,
is that right? Is that what I am?

93
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
No-one's ever told me that before.

94
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:21,400
Am I sweet? Really?

95
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:22,900
Yeah, dead sweet.

96
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,500
Thank you.

97
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:29,800
It's a wall. Isn't there
supposed to be a garden out there?

98
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:33,200
Don't be daft, no-one's got a
garden any more! Who's got a garden?

99
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:35,100
Don't tell me you've got a garden!

100
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:37,500
No, I've just got the Tardis.

101
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:42,100
I remember.
That's the amnesia! So what
happened, where did they get you?

102
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:46,700
We'd just left
Raxacoricofallapatorius and then we
went to Kyoto, that's right,

103
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:52,000
Japan in 1336, and we only
just escaped. We were together
and we were laughing and then. . .

104
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,600
there was this light,

105
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:57,400
this white light
coming through the walls, and then. . .

106
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,200
I woke up here.

107
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:03,500
Yeah, that's the transmat beam,
that's how they pick the housemates.

108
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:08,000
Oh, Lynda with a Y. . .

109
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,700
Sweet little Lynda.

110
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:13,400
It's worse than that.

111
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,800
I'm not just some passing traveller.

112
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:18,900
No stupid little transmat
gets inside my ship.

113
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:24,900
That beam was 15 million
times more powerful, which
means. . .this isn't just a game.

114
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,300
There's something else going on.

115
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:33,300
Well, here's the latest update
from the Big Brother house.

116
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:35,200
I'm getting out,

117
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:38,000
I'm gonna find my friends. . .

118
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,800
and then I'm gonna find you.

119
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:50,300
Need a word. Hold on.

120
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:53,900
Let me finish this. 19, 18. . .

121
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:58,000
17, 16, 15. . .

122
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:01,400
Thank you, people, transmitting in. . .

123
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:05,000
12, 11, 10. . .

124
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:09,100
But I need to find the Doctor.
Just shut up and play the game!

125
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:11,000
All right, then. . .what the hell?

126
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,200
I'm gonna play to win!

127
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:15,800
And. . .cue.

128
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:18,700
Let's play the Weakest Link!

129
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:24,700
Start the clock. Agorax,
the name of which basic foodstuff
is an anagram of the word "beard"?

130
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:26,400
Bread. Correct.

131
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:31,900
Fitch, in the Pantraffic Calendar,
which month comes after Hoob?

132
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,800
Is it. . .Clavadoe?

133
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:41,400
No, Pandoff. Rose, in maths,
what is 258 minus 158? 100.

134
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:43,300
Correct. Rodrick. Bank!

135
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:46,300
Which letter of the alphabet
appears in the word "dangle"

136
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:49,000
but not in the word "gland"?

137
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:50,900
E. Correct.

138
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:57,700
Colleen, in social security, what

139
00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:05,500
Correct. Broff, the Great Cobalt
Pyramid is built on the remains of
which famous old Earth institute?

140
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:09,100
Touchdown. No, Torchwood.

141
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:14,100
Agorax, in language, all five
examples of which type of letter

142
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:17,500
appear in the word facetious?
Vowels.

143
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:22,600
Correct.
Fitch, in biology, which blood
cells contain iron - red or white?

144
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:23,600
Erm. . .

145
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:26,900
White. No, red.

146
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:33,400
Rose, in the holovid
series Jupiter Rising,
the Grexnik is married to whom?

147
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:35,700
How should I know?

148
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:38,500
Why is she laughing?

149
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:40,900
Rodrick, in maths. . .

150
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:44,800
Oh, my God, I think she knows.

151
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:47,400
And I've got a housemate
who appeared out of nowhere.

152
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:50,400
I told you.
It's like the game's running itself.

153
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:56,400
It's the buccaneer look - a
little a dash of pirate and just a
tweak of President Schwarzenegger.

154
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:59,600
I'm not sure about the vest, what
about a bit of colour to lift it?

155
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:02,400
Absolutely not,
never wear black with colour.

156
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:05,000
Now, let's talk jackets.

157
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:07,000
I kinda like the first one.

158
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:10,700
No, that's a bit too
much Hell's Angel,
I think I like the shorter one.

159
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,900
Look, waist-length, nice
and slimming, shows off the bum.

160
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,500
Works for me. Once we've got an
outfit, we can look at the face.

161
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,500
Ever thought about cosmetic
surgery?

162
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:25,300
I've considered it. A little
lift around the eyes, tighten up
the jaw line. What do you think?

163
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:28,200
Oh, let's have
a bit more ambition!

164
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:31,500
Let's do something. . .cutting edge.

165
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:34,100
So, Rose, what do you actually do?

166
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:39,500
I just travel about a bit,
a bit of a. . .tourist, I suppose.

167
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:41,800
Another way of saying unemployed?
No.

168
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:45,500
Have you got a job?
Well, not really, no, but. . .

169
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:50,700
Then you ARE unemployed, and yet
you've still got enough money
to buy peroxide. Why Fitch?

170
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:57,500
I think she got a few of
the questions wrong, that's all.
And you'd know all about that.

171
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:03,100
Well, yeah, but I can't vote for
myself, so it had to be Fitch.

172
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:08,100
I'm sorry, that's the game,
that's how it works.

173
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:10,100
I had to vote for someone.

174
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:13,800
Let me try again, it was the lights
and everything, I couldn't think.

175
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:19,700
In fact, with three answers wrong,
Broff was the weakest link in that
round, but it's votes that count.

176
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:22,700
I'm sorry, please. . .

177
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,400
Oh, God, help me!

178
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:30,900
Fitch, you are the weakest link.
Goodbye.

179
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:43,100
And we've gone to the adverts,
back in three minutes!

180
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:45,900
What was that? What just happened?

181
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:48,900
She was the weakest link,
she gets disintegrated.

182
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:53,800
Blasted into atoms.

183
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:55,700
But I voted for her!

184
00:11:58,100 --> 00:11:59,500
Oh, my God, this is sick!

185
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:04,500
All of you, you're just sick!
I'm not playing this!
I'm not playing!

186
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:09,200
I. . .I can't do it!

187
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:13,100
Oh, please, somebody let me out!

188
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:14,800
You are the weakest link.

189
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:19,200
Goodbye.

190
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:27,500
Don't try to escape.

191
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,800
It's play. . .or die.

192
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:39,400
Doctor,
they said all housemates must gather
on the sofa, you've got to.

193
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:41,100
I'm busy getting out, thanks.

194
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:44,800
But if you don't obey, then
all the housemates get punished.

195
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,900
Well, maybe I'll be voted out, then.

196
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,400
How stupid are you? You've only
just joined, you're not eligible.

197
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:53,000
Don't try anything clever
or we all get it in the neck.

198
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,100
Big Brother house,
this is Davina-droid.

199
00:12:56,100 --> 00:13:00,100
Crosbie, Lynda and Strood,
you have all been nominated
for eviction.

200
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:05,000
And the eighth person to be
evicted from the Big Brother house
is. . .

201
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:10,400
Crosbie!
Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

202
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:13,400
It should've been me,
that's not fair. Oh, Crosbie. . .

203
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:18,200
Crosbie, you have ten
seconds to make your farewells
and then we're gonna get you.

204
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,800
I won't forget you!
I'm sorry I stole your soap.

205
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,500
I don't mind, honestly!

206
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:27,400
Thanks for the food, you were
a smashing cook, bless you.

207
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:30,300
Crosbie, please leave
the Big Brother house.

208
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:38,300
Bye, then. Bye, Lynda.

209
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:39,800
Bye. . .

210
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:52,900
I don't believe it, poor Crosbie.

211
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:56,300
It's only a game show!
She'll make a fortune on the outside.

212
00:13:56,300 --> 00:14:01,000
Sell her story,
release a record, fitness video,
all of that, she'll be laughing.

213
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:04,600
What do you mean, on the outside?
Here we go.

214
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:17,900
Well, what are they waiting for?
Why don't they just let her go?
Stop it, it's not funny!

215
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:26,600
Eviction in five, four,
three, two, one!

216
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:36,500
What was that?

217
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:40,200
Disintegrator beam.

218
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,900
She's been evicted.

219
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:50,100
>From life.

220
00:14:56,900 --> 00:15:00,400
No-one programmed the transmat,
no-one selected the new contestants.

221
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:03,300
It is exactly like those stories.
Oh, don't start that again.

222
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:05,400
I think you need to
take a session off.

223
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:09,300
I would, if you'd take it with me.
And don't start that again either.

224
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:13,200
Though the rumours go back decades,
saying that something's been
hidden up here

225
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:15,800
underneath the transmissions.

226
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:17,900
But the controller would know.

227
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,300
She watches everything.

228
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:22,300
Maybe she just can't see it.

229
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:26,000
You've got to allow for human error.
Well, that's your problem, then.

230
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:30,800
I don't think she's been human
for years.

231
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:46,100
18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, transmit.

232
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:47,300
Are you insane?

233
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:52,300
You just step right into the
disintegrator? Is it that important,
getting your face on the telly?

234
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:54,800
Is it worth dying for? !
We haven't got a choice!

235
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:58,900
But I thought you had to apply.
Don't be so stupid, that's how
they played it centuries back.

236
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,100
You get chosen whether
you like it or not.

237
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:05,600
Everyone on Earth is a potential
contestant, the transmat beam
picks you out at random.

238
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,700
It's non-stop, there are 60
Big Brother Houses running at once.

239
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:12,000
How many, 60?! They've had to
cut back, it's not what it was.

240
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:13,900
It's a charnel house!

241
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:18,900
What about the winners, what do they
get? They get to live. Is that it? !
Well, isn't that enough?

242
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:23,500
Rose is out there. She got caught
in the transmat, she's a contestant.

243
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:25,200
Time I got out.

244
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:29,800
That other contestant, Linda with an
I, she was forcibly evicted for what?

245
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:33,500
Damage to property. What, like this?

246
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:41,500
No, I'm just not getting this,
it's just too. . .safe, too decent.
And you'd never keep it clean.

247
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,300
Stage two ready and waiting.

248
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:45,400
Bring it on, girls.

249
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:53,200
Now it's time for the face-off!

250
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:55,500
Does that mean I get
to compete with someone else?

251
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:59,000
No, like I said, face. . .off.

252
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:04,900
I think you'd look good
with a dog's head.

253
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:08,300
Or maybe no head at all,
that would be so outrageous.

254
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:11,300
And we could stitch your legs
to the middle of your chest.

255
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:14,100
Nothing is too extreme,
it's to die for!

256
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:16,700
Now hold on, ladies, I don't want
to have to shoot either one of you.

257
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,500
But you're unarmed.
You're naked!

258
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:22,200
But that's a Compact Laser Deluxe!

259
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:24,300
Where were you hiding that?

260
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:28,000
You really don't want to know.
Give me that accessory!

261
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:34,300
You are the weakest link, goodbye!

262
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:43,400
Going to the break,
two minutes on the clock.

263
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:47,100
Just a reminder, we've got solar
flare activity coming up in ten.

264
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:50,500
Colleen was clever, she banked all
the money, why'd you you vote
for her?

265
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:52,100
Cos I want to keep you in!

266
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:55,900
You're stupid, you don't even know
the Princess Vossaheen's surname.

267
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:58,600
When it comes to the final,
I want to be up against you.

268
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:05,500
So that you get disintegrated and I
get a load of credits, courtesy of
the Bad Wolf Corporation.

269
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,900
What do you mean? Who's Bad Wolf?

270
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:12,000
They're in charge.
They run the Game Station.

271
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:13,600
Why are they called Bad Wolf?

272
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,600
I dunno, it's just a name.

273
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:18,700
It's like an old Earth
nursery rhyme, what does it matter?

274
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:23,100
I keep hearing those words
everywhere we go, Bad Wolf. . .

275
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:27,800
The things you've seen. . .
The darkness!

276
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:31,600
The big bad wolf.

277
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:35,400
Attention, all personnel, Bad Wolf
One descending. Blaidd Drwg. . .

278
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:38,000
What does it mean? Bad Wolf.

279
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:46,000
Different times, different places,
like it's written all over the
universe. What are you on about?

280
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:50,700
If the Bad Wolf are in charge
of the quiz, then. . .
maybe I'm not here by mistake.

281
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:55,400
Someone's been planning this.

282
00:18:55,400 --> 00:19:01,300
The Doctor, you've broken the
house rules, Big Brother has
no choice but to evict you.

283
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:06,500
You have ten seconds
to make your farewells,
and then we're gonna get you.

284
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:09,700
Come on, then, open up! You're mad,
it's like you want to die!

285
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:13,000
I reckon he's a plant, he was
only brought in to stir things up.

286
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,600
The Doctor, please
leave the Big Brother house.

287
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:20,000
Come on, then! Disintegrate me!

288
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:23,200
Come on, what are you waiting for?
He's mad, he's bonkers.

289
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,800
I told you to keep an eye on him,
not kill him.

290
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:28,700
He damaged the property,
it's an automatic process.

291
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:34,400
Eviction in five, four. . .

292
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:37,000
three, two. . .

293
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,100
one!

294
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:45,300
Ha-ha, I knew it! Do you see?
Someone brought me into this game.

295
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:49,500
If they wanted me dead, they could've
transmatted me into a volcano.
What did you do? Nothing,

296
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:52,200
it's like. . .some sort of override.

297
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:54,700
Maybe the security
isn't as tight this end.

298
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:57,300
Are you following this?
I'm getting out!

299
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,600
Come with me.

300
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:07,100
We're not allowed!
Stay in there, you've got a 50/50
chance of disintegration.

301
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:10,000
Stay with me, I promise
I'll get you out alive, come on!

302
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,000
No, I can't. . .I can't.
Lynda, you're sweet.

303
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:17,600
>From what I've seen of your world,
do you think anybody votes for sweet?

304
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:31,200
Hold on. . .I've been here before.

305
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:33,100
This is Satellite Five.

306
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:41,100
No guards. That makes a change.

307
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:44,700
You'd think a big business like
Satellite Five
would be armed to the teeth.

308
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:48,200
No-one's called it Satellite Five in
ages. It's the Game Station now.

309
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:50,800
It hasn't been Satellite Five
in about 100 years.

310
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:54,400
100 years exactly.
It's the year 200100.

311
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,800
I was here before, Floor 139.

312
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:59,700
The satellite was broadcasting
news channels back then.

313
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:03,400
I had a bit of trouble upstairs,
nothing too serious.

314
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:06,200
Easy, gave 'em a hand,
home in time for tea.

315
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,900
100 years ago?

316
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:12,200
What, you were here 100 years ago?
Yep.

317
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:14,300
You're looking good on it.

318
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:15,900
I moisturise.

319
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:19,700
Funny sort of readings.
All kinds of energy.

320
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:24,000
The place is humming. It's weird.
This goes way beyond
normal transmissions.

321
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:27,400
What would they need all
that power for? I don't know,

322
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:31,000
I think we're the first ever
contestants to get outside.

323
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:35,000
I had two friends with me,
they must've got caught in the
same transmat, where would they be?

324
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,800
They could have been allocated
anywhere, there's 100
different games.

325
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:42,100
Like what? Well,
there's ten floors of Big Brother,

326
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:44,500
there's a different house
behind each door,

327
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:47,500
and beyond that there's all sorts of
shows, it's non-stop.

328
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:50,000
There's, em. . .Call My Bluff
with real guns,

329
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,500
Countdown where you've got 30
seconds to stop the bomb going off.

330
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:56,900
Ground Force, which is a nasty one,
you get turned into compost.

331
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,200
Erm. . .Wipeout,

332
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:02,600
speaks for itself, oh, and
Stars In Their Eyes, literally,

333
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:06,200
stars in their eyes -
if you don't sing, you get blinded.

334
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:08,000
And you watch this stuff?

335
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,500
Everyone does. How come you don't?

336
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:12,000
I never paid for my licence.

337
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,500
Oh, my God,
you get executed for that!

338
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:16,900
Let 'em try.

339
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:19,800
You keep saying things
that don't make sense.

340
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:21,700
Who are you, though, Doctor, really?

341
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:23,300
It doesn't matter.

342
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:27,800
Well, it does to me.
I've just put my life in your hands.

343
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:29,400
I'm a traveller wandering past.

344
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:32,000
Believe it or not,
all I'm after is a quiet life.

345
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:37,000
So. . .if we get out of here,
what are you gonna do,
just. . .wander off again?

346
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,200
Fast as I can.

347
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:42,900
Cos, em. . .I could come with ya.

348
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,100
Maybe you could.

349
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:50,000
I wouldn't get in the way.
I wouldn't mind if you did.

350
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:53,500
Not a bad idea, Lynda with a Y.

351
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:57,200
But first of all we've gotta
concentrate on the getting out,

352
00:22:57,300 --> 00:23:00,900
and to do that, you've got to know
your enemy. Who's controlling it?

353
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:04,100
Who's in charge of the satellite now?
Hold on. . .

354
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Your lords and masters.

355
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:21,200
OK, you win, the
Controller's got to handle this.

356
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:24,500
Archive makes a record of
all transmat activities.

357
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:26,900
Find out how he got on board.
Archive Six.

358
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:52,900
Controller. . .

359
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:55,000
we have a problem.

360
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:56,600
Continue working.

361
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:58,600
We have a security problem.

362
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:00,400
Continue working.

363
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:07,900
I'm sorry, but I can't. We have
contestants outside the games,
but the alarms haven't gone off.

364
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:10,500
No security, the games continue.

365
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:13,900
We can't just let them wander.
They are no-one.

366
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:17,900
They are no-one.

367
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:25,000
I'm sorry, I was just, erm. . .

368
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,900
Archive Six is out of bounds.

369
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,100
But I need to check the transmat log.
Archive Six is out of bounds.

370
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:32,300
No-one may enter Archive Six.

371
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,000
Return to work.

372
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:41,200
Return to work.

373
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:46,800
Inform all staff,
solar flares in delta point seven.

374
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:49,100
19, 20. . .

375
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:54,400
Compatible systems. . .

376
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:57,700
Just align the wave signature. . .

377
00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:01,100
That-a-boy! Got myself a gun!

378
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:06,100
Well, ladies, the pleasure was
all mine, which is the only
thing that matters in the end.

379
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:15,400
Two hearts, that's him.

380
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:16,900
Which floor?

381
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:24,900
Blimey!

382
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:28,300
I've never seen it for real before,
not from orbit.

383
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:30,000
Planet Earth!

384
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:34,300
What's happened to it?
It's always been like that,
ever since I was born. See there?

385
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:37,000
That's
the Great Atlantic Smog Storm.

386
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,700
We get newsflashes, telling us
when it's safe to breathe outside.

387
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:41,700
So the population just sits there.

388
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:44,800
Half the world's too fat, half's too
thin, and you lot just watch telly.

389
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:47,700
10, 000 channels,
all beaming down from here.

390
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:51,500
The human race! Brainless sheep,
being fed on a diet of. . .

391
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:54,600
Mind you, have they still got
that programme where three
people live with a bear?

392
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:58,700
Oh, Bear With Me, I love that one!
And me. The celebrity edition
where the bear got in the bath. . .

393
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:02,000
But it's all gone wrong,
I mean, history's gone wrong, again!

394
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,000
This should be the Fourth Great and
Bountiful Human Empire.

395
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:08,300
I don't understand.
Last time I was here I put it right.

396
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:11,800
No, but that's when it first went
wrong, 100 years ago, like you said.

397
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:14,800
All the news channels,
they just shut down overnight.

398
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,600
But that was me. I did that.

399
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:22,600
There was nothing left in their
place, no information.
The whole planet froze.

400
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:27,300
The government, the economy, they
collapsed. That was the start of it,

401
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:29,000
100 years of hell.

402
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,500
Oh, my. . .

403
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:36,600
I made this world.

404
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:48,600
That leaves Rose and Rodrick,
you're going head-to-head.

405
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:51,500
Let's play. . .the Weakest Link!

406
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:53,500
That's the end of tactical voting.

407
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:55,000
You're on your own now.

408
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:02,100
Hey, handsome, good to see you.
Any sign of Rose?
Can't you track her down?

409
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:04,900
She must be still inside the games,
all the rooms are shielded.

410
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,900
If I can get inside this computer.
She's got to be here somewhere.

411
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:10,400
Hurry, these games
don't have a happy ending.

412
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:12,600
You think I don't know that? !

413
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:17,100
There you go. Patch that in,
it's programmed to find her.

414
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:19,000
Thanks. Hey, there. Hello!

415
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:21,200
Captain Jack Harkness. Lynda Moss.

416
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:23,600
Nice to meet you, Lynda Moss.
Do you mind flirting outside?

417
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,700
I was just saying hello!
For you, that's flirting.

418
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:27,600
I'm not complaining. Muchas gracias.

419
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:31,300
Not compatible! This stupid
system doesn't make sense!

420
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:39,100
This place should be a basic
broadcaster, but the systems
are twice as complicated.

421
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:42,200
It's more than TV, this station's
transmitting something else.
Like what?

422
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:45,700
I don't know. This whole
Bad Wolf thing's tied up with me.

423
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:50,100
Someone's manipulating my entire
life, it's some sort of trap,
and Rose is stuck inside it.

424
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:54,900
Rose, in geography,
the Grand Central Ravine is named
after which ancient British city?

425
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:59,700
Is it York? No, the correct
answer is Sheffield.

426
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:04,800
Found her! Floor 407. Oh, my God,
she's with the Anne-droid,
get her out of there!

427
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:08,600
Rodrick, in literature, the
author of Lucky was Jackie who?

428
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:13,400
Stewart.
No, the correct answer is Collins.

429
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:17,000
Rose, the oldest inhabitant
of the Isop Galaxy

430
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,000
is the face of what? Boe!
The Face of Boe!

431
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:24,600
That is the correct answer.

432
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:30,300
Come on! Come on!

433
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:34,800
Rodrick, in history who was the
president of the Red Velvets?

434
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:36,700
Hoshbin Frane.

435
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:38,100
That is correct.

436
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:44,000
Rose, food, the dish gaffabeque
originated on which planet?

437
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
Em. . .is it. . . ?

438
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:53,400
Mars?

439
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:56,700
No, the correct answer is Lucifer.

440
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:06,100
Rodrick, which measurement
of length is said
to have been defined

441
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:07,500
by the Emperor Jate

442
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:10,200
as the distance from his nose
to his fingertip?

443
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:15,600
Would that be a goffle?
No, the correct answer is a paab.

444
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:19,800
Rose, in fashion, Stella Pok Baint
is famous for what?

445
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:25,900
Shoes.

446
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:28,200
No. The correct answer is hats.
Rodrick. . .

447
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:32,100
Game Room Six, which one is it?
Over here!

448
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:34,700
San Hazeldine.

449
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:36,800
No, the correct answer
is San Chen.

450
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:39,800
Let me blast it open.
You can't, it's a vital combination.

451
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:46,500
Rose, in history, which Icelandic
city hosted Murder Spree 20?

452
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:54,800
Reykjavik?

453
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:01,300
No, the correct answer
is Pola Ventura.

454
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:08,600
Oh, my God! I've done it!
You've lost!

455
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:12,900
Cone on, come on, come on!

456
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:16,100
Rodrick. . . I'm not mean to be
here. . .you ARE the strongest
link.

457
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:19,300
I need to find the Doctor,
he's gotta be here somewhere!

458
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:22,200
He wouldn't just leave me!

459
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:25,700
Thank you so much. This game is
illegal, I'm telling you to stop!

460
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:29,100
Rose! Stop this game!
I order you to stop this game!

461
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:30,600
You are the weakest link. . . .

462
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:33,200
Look out for the Anne-droid,
it's armed!

463
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:36,700
A-a-a-a-ah!

464
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:39,800
What the hell did you do to her?

465
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:43,200
I'm calling security,
you have no permission to be here.

466
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:44,900
Deactivate the Anne-droid.

467
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:49,500
You killed her and all
you're worried about money? !
Back off, mister! Back off!

468
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:54,100
Control, I'm overriding your
commands, I need security,
and I need it here right now!

469
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:55,700
It's that lot. . .

470
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:57,500
Leave him alone!

471
00:30:57,500 --> 00:31:00,400
Sir, put down the gun
or I'll have to shoot.

472
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:05,600
You killed her! Your stupid
freaking game show killed her!

473
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:10,600
Sir, I'm arresting you under Private
Legislation 16 of the Game Station
Syndicate. . .

474
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:13,000
HIS VOICE FADES OUT

475
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:28,900
Can you tell us the
purpose of this device, sir?

476
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,300
Can you tell us how you got
on board?

477
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:33,800
Just leave him alone.

478
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:35,700
I'm asking him.

479
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:41,400
Sir? Can you tell us who you are?

480
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:52,000
You will be taken from this
place to the lunar penal colony,
to be held without trial.

481
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:54,700
You may not appeal
against this sentence.

482
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:58,800
Is that understood?

483
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:06,300
Let's do it.

484
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:20,700
Oh, my God, now we're in trouble.

485
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:24,400
Floor 500.

486
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:26,900
ALARM SOUNDS
Clear the floor!

487
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,500
He's on his way up here. . .
with a gun!

488
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:36,500
This is an emergency,
close down the lift.

489
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:38,600
All staff are reminded that
solar flares commence. . .

490
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:41,300
Never mind solar flares,
he's gonna kill you!

491
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,700
OK, move away from the desk.
Nobody try anything clever.

492
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:51,700
Everybody clear, stand to the side
and stay there.

493
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:53,600
Who's in charge of this place?
19, 20. . .

494
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:57,700
This satellite's more than
a game station. 79, 80. . .
Who killed Rose Tyler?

495
00:32:57,800 --> 00:33:00,800
All staff are reminded. . .
I want an answer!

496
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:02,600
She can't reply. Don't shoot!

497
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:05,000
Oh, don't be so thick,
like I was ever gonna shoot.

498
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:09,500
Captain, we've got more guards on the
way up, secure the exits. Yes, sir!
What were you saying?

499
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:15,000
But. . .I've got your gun. OK, so
shoot me. Why can't she answer?
She's, erm. . . Can I put this down?

500
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,600
If you want, just hurry up. Thanks.

501
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:19,300
Sorry, erm. . .

502
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:22,900
The Controller is linked into
the transmissions, the entire
output goes through her brain.

503
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:26,700
You're not a member of staff, so she
doesn't recognise your existence.
What's her name?

504
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:31,800
I don't know. She was installed
when she was five years old, that's
the only life she's ever known.

505
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:34,300
Doors sealed, we're safe for about
ten minutes. Keep an eye on 'em.

506
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:37,400
That stuff about something going on
with the Game Station,
I think you're right.

507
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:41,400
I've kept a log, unauthorised
transmats, encrypted signals.

508
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:43,200
It's been going on for years.
Show me.

509
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:46,100
You're not allowed in there,
Archive Six is out of bounds.

510
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:48,800
Do I look like an
out-of-bounds sort of guy?

511
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:16,900
What the hell. . . ?

512
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,500
Solar flare activity in delta. . .

513
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:26,400
If you're not holding us hostage,
let us out, the staff are terrified!

514
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:30,400
That's the same staff who
execute hundreds of contestants?
We're just doing our jobs.

515
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:34,400
With that sentence you
just lost the right to even
talk to me, now back off!

516
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:39,900
That's just the solar flares.

517
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:44,500
They interfere with the
broadcast signal, so this place
automatically powers down.

518
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:49,100
Planet Earth gets a few repeats.
It's all quite normal. Doctor. . .

519
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:53,300
Doctor? Whatever it is,
you can wait. I think she wants you.

520
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:56,200
Doctor. . . Doctor. . .

521
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:58,600
Where's the Doctor? I'm here.

522
00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:01,500
I can't see, blind. . .

523
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:03,600
So blind, all my life blind.

524
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:07,000
All I can see is numbers,
but I saw you. What do you want?

525
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,300
Solar flares hiding me,
they can't hear me.

526
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:11,800
My masters listen, but they can't
hear me now, the sun,

527
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:14,500
the sun is so bright.
Who are your masters?

528
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:16,900
They wired my head,
the name is forbidden.

529
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:20,000
They control my thoughts,

530
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:24,100
my masters, I had to be careful.
They monitor transmission.
but they don't watch the programmes.

531
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:28,000
I could hide you inside the games.
My friend died inside your games.

532
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:30,600
It doesn't matter.
Don't you dare tell me that!

533
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:36,100
They've been hiding, my masters,
hiding in the dark space,
watching and shaping the Earth,

534
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:38,500
so. . .so. . .so many years.

535
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:43,200
Always been there, guiding humanity,
hundreds and hundreds of years.

536
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:46,100
Who are they? They wait and plan
and grow in numbers,

537
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:49,200
they're strong now,
so strong, my masters. Who are they?

538
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:51,100
But speak of you.

539
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:55,000
My masters, they fear the Doctor.
Tell me! Who are they?

540
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:03,900
When's the next solar flare?
Two years' time.

541
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:06,300
Fat lot of good that is!
Found the Tardis.

542
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:09,500
We're not leaving now.
No, but the Tardis worked it out.

543
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:13,400
You'll wanna watch this.
Lynda, could you stand
over there for me, please?

544
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:15,100
I just wanna go home.

545
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:19,000
It'll only take a second,
could you stand in that spot?
Quick as you can!

546
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,600
Everybody watching?

547
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:24,000
OK, three, two, one.

548
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:31,700
But you killed her! Oh, do you think?

549
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:42,400
What the hell was that? It's a
transmat beam, not a disintegrator,
a secondary transmat system.

550
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:46,600
People don't get killed in the
games, they get transported
across Space.

551
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:49,700
Doctor, Rose is still alive!

552
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:03,700
No, it can't be.

553
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:08,100
I saw you die!

554
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:14,300
She's out there somewhere! Doctor!

555
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:16,400
Coordinates 5.6.1.

556
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:19,300
Don't, the solar flare's gone,
they'll hear you!

557
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:21,500
No, my masters, no, I defy you!

558
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:27,500
Sigma 7. . . A-a-a-ah! They took her.

559
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,600
Oh, my masters. . .

560
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:52,600
you can kill me. . .

561
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:54,900
for I have brought your destruction.

562
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:03,300
Look, use that. It might contain
the final numbers,

563
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:07,500
I kept a log of all the unscheduled
transmissions. Nice. . .Thanks.

564
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:09,700
Captain Jack Harkness, by the way.

565
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:12,500
I'm Davitch Pavale.
Nice to meet you, Davitch Pavale.

566
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:14,000
There's a time and a place.

567
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:17,400
Are you saying that this whole
set-up's been a disguise all along?

568
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:20,600
Going way back, installing the
Jagrafess 100 years ago.

569
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:26,100
Someone's been playing a long game,
controlling the human race from
behind the scenes for generations.

570
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:27,600
Click on this.

571
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:33,200
The transmat delivers to that point,

572
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:36,500
right on the edge of the solar
system. But there's nothing there.

573
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:39,700
It looks like nothing because that's
what this satellite does.

574
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:43,100
Underneath the transmission
there's another signal. Doing what?

575
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:45,100
Hiding whatever's out there.

576
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:47,600
Hiding it from sonar, radar, scanner.

577
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:52,400
There's something's sitting
right on top of Planet Earth,
but it's completely invisible.

578
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:55,300
If I cancel the signal. . .

579
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:14,900
That's impossible.

580
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:18,100
I know those ships.
They were destroyed.

581
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:22,300
Obviously, they survived.
Who did? Who are they?

582
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:24,300
200 ships.

583
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:27,400
More than 2, 000 on board each one.

584
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:29,400
That's just about
half a million of them.

585
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:31,100
Half a million what?

586
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:32,900
Daleks.

587
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:36,900
Alert! Alert! We are detected!

588
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:40,000
It is the Doctor!
He has located us!

589
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,500
Open communications channel!

590
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:47,700
The female will stand! Stand!

591
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:56,300
I will talk to the Doctor.

592
00:39:56,300 --> 00:39:59,000
Oh, will you? That's nice, hello!

593
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:01,500
The Dalek stratagem
nears completion.

594
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:05,500
The fleet is almost ready.
You will not intervene.

595
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:07,500
Oh, really? Why's that, then?

596
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:10,200
We have your associate.

597
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:15,400
You will obey or she
will be exterminated.

598
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:17,900
No.

599
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:25,800
Explain yourself.

600
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:28,100
I said "no".

601
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:30,800
What is the meaning
of this negative?

602
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:34,300
It means no.
But she will be destroyed!

603
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:38,000
No. . .cos this is what I'M gonna do.

604
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:42,000
I'm gonna rescue her, I'm gonna save
Rose Tyler from the middle of the
Dalek fleet,

605
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:45,500
and then I'm gonna save the Earth,
and then just to finish off,

606
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:49,600
I'm gonna wipe every last
stinking Dalek out of the sky!

607
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:54,000
But you have no weapons,
no defences, no plan!

608
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,700
Yeah. . .

609
00:40:55,700 --> 00:40:58,500
and doesn't that scare you to death?

610
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:00,500
Rose? Yes, Doctor?

611
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:03,400
I'm coming to get you.

612
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:08,900
The Doctor is initiating hostile action!
The statagem must advance!

613
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:11,900
Begin the invasion of Earth!

614
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:14,300
The Doctor will be exterminated!

615
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:15,900
Exterminate! Exterminate!

616
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,900
Exterminate!

617
00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:22,500
Exterminate! Exterminate!

618
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:29,600
Launch missiles, exterminate.

619
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:34,200
We've got incoming! This is it,
ladies and gentlemen, we are at war.

620
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:37,400
There's an army
about to invade this station.

621
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:39,600
Defences have gone off-line.

622
00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:40,400
I'm dead or about to die any
second with no chance of escape.

623
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:43,700
I'm dead or about to die any
second with no chance of escape.

624
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:50,800
They interfere with the
broadcast signal, so this place
automatically powers down.

625
00:41:55,900 --> 00:41:58,800
How did you survive the Time War?

626
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:01,800
They survived through me!

627
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:21,700
