1
00:00:14,193 --> 00:00:17,540
- I said, no.
- A sapphire waterfall!

2
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:19,524
It's a waterfall, made of sapphires!

3
00:00:19,799 --> 00:00:21,430
<i>This enormous jewel,
size of a glacier,</i>

4
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:24,610
reaches the Cliffs of Oblivion, then
shatters into sapphires at the edge,

5
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:27,531
they fall 100,000 feet
into a crystal ravine.

6
00:00:27,631 --> 00:00:31,705
- I bet you say that to all the girls.
- Oh, come on, they're boarding now.

7
00:00:31,805 --> 00:00:34,200
It's no fun on my own.
Four hours, that's all it takes.

8
00:00:34,607 --> 00:00:38,839
<i>No, that's four hours there and four
hours back, that's like a school trip.</i>

9
00:00:38,939 --> 00:00:41,066
- I'd rather go sunbathing!
- You be careful.

10
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:42,966
<i>That's X-tonic sunlight.</i>

11
00:00:43,066 --> 00:00:47,425
Oh, I'm safe. It says in the brochure,
this glass is 15-feet thick.

12
00:00:47,525 --> 00:00:48,630
<i>All right, I give up.</i>

13
00:00:48,730 --> 00:00:51,454
Back for dinner, we'll try that
antigravity restaurant. With bibs.

14
00:00:51,554 --> 00:00:52,305
<i>That's a date.</i>

15
00:00:52,591 --> 00:00:53,717
Well, not a date.

16
00:00:53,817 --> 00:00:55,689
Oh, you know what I mean.
Oh, get off!

17
00:00:55,927 --> 00:00:57,070
- See you later.
- Oy!

18
00:00:57,170 --> 00:00:59,539
- And you be careful, all right?
- Naaah.

19
00:00:59,639 --> 00:01:00,640
Taking a big space truck

20
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:03,296
with bunch of strangers across
diamond planet called Midnight?

21
00:01:03,396 --> 00:01:04,935
What could possibly go wrong?

22
00:01:29,201 --> 00:01:32,460

00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:45,274
<i>Complimentary juicepack
and complimentary...</i>

27
00:01:45,374 --> 00:01:47,185
<i>Just the headphones, please.</i>

28
00:01:47,645 --> 00:01:48,884
There you go.

29
00:01:50,013 --> 00:01:52,510
That's the headphones
for Channels 1 to 36,

30
00:01:52,610 --> 00:01:55,362
modem link for 3D vidgames,
complimentary earplugs,

31
00:01:55,594 --> 00:01:57,870
<i>complimentary slippers,
complimentary juicepack,</i>

32
00:01:57,970 --> 00:01:59,421
<i>and complimentary peanuts.</i>

33
00:01:59,521 --> 00:02:01,495
I must warn you some
products may contain nuts.

34
00:02:01,764 --> 00:02:03,240
That'll be the peanuts.

35
00:02:03,885 --> 00:02:06,969
- Enjoy your trip.
- Oh, I can't wait! Allons-y!

36
00:02:07,658 --> 00:02:10,500
- I'm sorry?
- It's French, for let's go!

37
00:02:10,765 --> 00:02:12,020
Fascinating.

38
00:02:13,389 --> 00:02:15,898
- Headphones for channels 1-36...
- No thank you! Not for us!

39
00:02:15,998 --> 00:02:18,083
- Earplugs, please.
- There you go.

40
00:02:18,183 --> 00:02:21,705
They call it a sapphire waterfall,
but it's no such thing,

41
00:02:21,805 --> 00:02:23,990
sapphire's an aluminium oxide,

42
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:27,614
but the glacier is just a compound
silica with iron pigmentation!

43
00:02:27,714 --> 00:02:30,311
<i>- Have you got that pillow for my neck?
- Yes, sir.</i>

44
00:02:30,411 --> 00:02:31,505
<i>And the pills?</i>

45
00:02:31,605 --> 00:02:34,839
Yes, all measured
out for you, there you go.

46
00:02:35,477 --> 00:02:36,170
Hobbes!

47
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:38,140
Professor Winfold Hobbes!

48
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:40,668
- I'm the Doctor, hello!
- It's my 14th time!

49
00:02:40,887 --> 00:02:42,115
Oh! My first.

50
00:02:42,215 --> 00:02:44,067
And I'm Dee Dee, Dee Dee Blasco.

51
00:02:44,167 --> 00:02:47,282
Don't bother the man!
Where's my water bottle?

52
00:02:47,382 --> 00:02:50,092
<i>Complimentary slippers,
complimentary juicepack,</i>

53
00:02:50,192 --> 00:02:51,681
<i>and complimentary peanuts,</i>

54
00:02:51,781 --> 00:02:54,700
<i>I must warn you some
products may contain nuts.</i>

55
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:59,345
Don't be silly, come and sit with us.
Look! We get slippers!

56
00:02:59,445 --> 00:03:01,729
- Jethro! Do what your mother says.
- I'm sitting here.

57
00:03:01,829 --> 00:03:04,633
Oh, he's ashamed of us.
But he doesn't mind us paying, does he?

58
00:03:04,733 --> 00:03:07,943
Don't you two start. Should I save
the juicepack or have it now?

59
00:03:08,043 --> 00:03:09,820
Look, it's peach and clementine!

60
00:03:10,495 --> 00:03:12,812
Ladies and gentlemen
and variations thereupon,

61
00:03:12,912 --> 00:03:16,659
welcome on board the Crusader 50,
if you would fasten your seatbelts,

62
00:03:16,759 --> 00:03:18,620
we'll be leaving any moment.

63
00:03:19,285 --> 00:03:19,940
Doors!

64
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:23,860
Shields down!

65
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:32,088
I'm afraid the view is shielded
until we reach the Waterfall Palace.

66
00:03:32,495 --> 00:03:35,111
Also, a reminder, Midnight has no air,

67
00:03:35,211 --> 00:03:38,390
so please don't touch
the exterior door seals.

68
00:03:38,859 --> 00:03:41,069
Fire exit at the rear,
and should we need to use it...

69
00:03:41,338 --> 00:03:42,500
you first.

70
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:46,481
Now I will hand you
over to Driver Joe...

71
00:03:47,057 --> 00:03:48,095
<i>Driver Joe at the wheel!</i>

72
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:50,715
<i>There's been a diamondfall
at the Winter Witch Canyon,</i>

73
00:03:50,815 --> 00:03:53,975
<i>so we'll be taking a slight detour,
as you'll see on the map.</i>

74
00:03:54,388 --> 00:03:57,341
<i>The journey covers 500
kliks to the Multifaceted Coast,</i>

75
00:03:57,660 --> 00:04:00,350
<i>duration is estimated at four hours.</i>

76
00:04:00,676 --> 00:04:02,165
<i>Thank you for travelling with us,</i>

77
00:04:02,265 --> 00:04:05,370
<i>and as they used to say
in the olden days, wagons roll!</i>

78
00:04:13,189 --> 00:04:14,291
<i>For your entertainment,</i>

79
00:04:14,391 --> 00:04:18,345
we have the Music Channel
playing retrovids of Earth Classics.

80
00:04:19,021 --> 00:04:21,824
# "Do It Do It Again" #
by Raffaella Carra

81
00:04:21,924 --> 00:04:25,660
Also, the latest artistic
installation from Ludovic Klein.

82
00:04:28,032 --> 00:04:30,837
<i>Plus, for the youngsters,
a rare treat : </i>

83
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:32,420
the Animation Archives.

84
00:04:33,126 --> 00:04:36,480
Four hours of funtime!
Enjoy!

85
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:06,637
Well, that's a mercy!

86
00:05:06,737 --> 00:05:11,224
I do apologise, ladies and gentlemen
and variations thereupon.

87
00:05:11,324 --> 00:05:13,772
We seem to have had a failure
of the Entertainment System...

88
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:14,685
Aw...

89
00:05:14,785 --> 00:05:17,463
- But what do we do?!
- We've got four hours of this!

90
00:05:17,563 --> 00:05:19,584
Four hours of just sitting here!

91
00:05:19,684 --> 00:05:23,220
Tell you what! We'll have to talk
to each other instead!

92
00:05:28,242 --> 00:05:30,833
98 KLIKS LATER...

93
00:05:33,609 --> 00:05:35,079
<i>So Biff said, "I'm going swimming".</i>

94
00:05:35,179 --> 00:05:38,451
Oh, I was all ready,
trunks and everything! Nose plug!

95
00:05:38,551 --> 00:05:40,879
He had this little nose plug,
you should've seen him.

96
00:05:40,979 --> 00:05:43,062
I went marching up to the lifeguard,

97
00:05:43,162 --> 00:05:46,206
and he was a Shamboni,
you know, those big foreheads?

98
00:05:46,363 --> 00:05:47,677
<i>Great big forehead!</i>

99
00:05:47,777 --> 00:05:49,729
And I said, where's the pool?

100
00:05:49,829 --> 00:05:52,582
And he said, "The pool is abstract!"

101
00:05:54,713 --> 00:05:56,078
It wasn't a real pool!

102
00:05:56,178 --> 00:05:58,575
- It was a concept!
- And you wore a nose plug!

103
00:05:58,675 --> 00:06:01,096
I was like this!
Mmm... where's the pool?

104
00:06:04,541 --> 00:06:07,544
150 KLIKS LATER...

105
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:09,671
<i>I'm just a second-year student,</i>

106
00:06:09,771 --> 00:06:12,190
but I wrote a paper on
the Lost Moon of Poosh,

107
00:06:12,456 --> 00:06:15,550
Professor Hobbes read it, liked it,
took me on as a researcher.

108
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:17,356
Just for the holidays. Well...

109
00:06:17,456 --> 00:06:21,267
I say researcher, most of the time
he's got me fetching and carrying.

110
00:06:21,367 --> 00:06:24,016
- But it's all good experience!
- And did they ever find it?

111
00:06:24,116 --> 00:06:26,305
- Find what?
- The Lost Moon of Poosh!

112
00:06:26,837 --> 00:06:28,163
No! Not yet!

113
00:06:28,263 --> 00:06:32,345
Well, maybe that'll be your great
discovery, one day. Here's to Poosh!

114
00:06:32,665 --> 00:06:33,727
Poosh!

115
00:06:34,183 --> 00:06:35,841
209 KLIKS LATER...

116
00:06:35,941 --> 00:06:38,510
No, no, I'm with this
friend of mine,

117
00:06:38,675 --> 00:06:41,385
Donna, she stayed behind
in the Leisure Palace. You?

118
00:06:41,485 --> 00:06:42,950
No, it's just me.

119
00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:45,025
Oh, I've done plenty of that.

120
00:06:45,298 --> 00:06:46,910
Travelling on my own.

121
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:48,259
I love it.

122
00:06:48,359 --> 00:06:51,193
- Do what you want! Go anywhere!
- I'm still getting used to it.

123
00:06:51,937 --> 00:06:55,185
I've... found myself single,
rather recently. Not by choice.

124
00:06:55,377 --> 00:06:57,500
- What happened?
- Oh, the usual.

125
00:06:57,835 --> 00:07:00,300
She needed her own
space, as they say.

126
00:07:00,988 --> 00:07:02,795
A different galaxy, in fact.

127
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:05,097
I reckon that's enough space, don't you?

128
00:07:05,439 --> 00:07:06,099
Yeah.

129
00:07:07,451 --> 00:07:09,478
I had a friend who went
to a different universe.

130
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:13,739
Oh, what's this, chicken or beef?

131
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,730
I think it's both.

132
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:20,309
251 KLIKS LATER...

133
00:07:20,409 --> 00:07:22,636
<i>So this is Midnight, d'you see?</i>

134
00:07:22,736 --> 00:07:28,265
Bombarded by the sun!
X-tonic rays, raw Galvanic Radiation...

135
00:07:28,944 --> 00:07:30,345
<i>Dee Dee, next slide!</i>

136
00:07:31,387 --> 00:07:32,950
<i>It's my pet project.</i>

137
00:07:33,415 --> 00:07:36,887
Actually, I'm the first person
to research this.

138
00:07:36,987 --> 00:07:38,450
Because you see...

139
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:43,067
..the history is fascinating,

140
00:07:43,988 --> 00:07:46,150
because there is no history.

141
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:49,670
There's no life in this entire system,
there couldn't be.

142
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:52,399
Before the Leisure Palace
Company moved in,

143
00:07:52,499 --> 00:07:56,225
no-one had come here in all eternity.

144
00:07:56,618 --> 00:07:58,653
No living thing...

145
00:08:01,725 --> 00:08:03,030
But how d'you know?

146
00:08:03,436 --> 00:08:05,147
I mean, if no-one can go outside...

147
00:08:05,247 --> 00:08:06,874
Oh, his imagination! Here we go!

148
00:08:06,974 --> 00:08:08,861
- He's got a point, though.
- Exactly!

149
00:08:08,961 --> 00:08:13,479
We look upon this world through glass.
Safe inside our metal box.

150
00:08:13,579 --> 00:08:16,780
Even the Leisure Palace
was lowered down from orbit.

151
00:08:17,195 --> 00:08:20,025
And here we are now,
crossing Midnight...

152
00:08:20,598 --> 00:08:22,506
but never touching it.

153
00:08:26,789 --> 00:08:28,060
We've stopped.

154
00:08:30,679 --> 00:08:31,930
<i>Have we stopped?</i>

155
00:08:33,163 --> 00:08:33,951
<i>Are we there?</i>

156
00:08:34,051 --> 00:08:35,390
We can't be, it's too soon.

157
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:38,577
<i>They don't stop,
Crusader vehicles never stop.</i>

158
00:08:38,933 --> 00:08:42,780
If you could just return to your seats,
it's just a small delay.

159
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:49,460
- Maybe just a pit stop.
- What's going on?

160
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:52,848
There's no pit to stop in, I've been
on this expedition 14 times,

161
00:08:52,948 --> 00:08:53,774
they never stop.

162
00:08:53,874 --> 00:08:56,917
Evidently, we have stopped,
so there's no point in denying it.

163
00:08:57,883 --> 00:09:00,141
- We've broken down!
- Thanks, Jethro.

164
00:09:00,241 --> 00:09:02,436
- In the middle of nowhere!
- That's enough, stop it!

165
00:09:02,536 --> 00:09:05,319
Ladies and gentlemen
and variations thereupon,

166
00:09:05,419 --> 00:09:08,000
we're just experiencing a short...

167
00:09:08,238 --> 00:09:11,592
delay, the driver needs
to stabilise the engine feeds.

168
00:09:11,901 --> 00:09:14,563
Perfectly routine, so if you could
just stay in your seats...

169
00:09:14,663 --> 00:09:16,609
- No, I'm sorry sir...
- There you go,

170
00:09:16,709 --> 00:09:20,025
- engine expert Two ticks!
- Sorry, sir, if you could sit down!

171
00:09:20,227 --> 00:09:22,248
- You're not supposed...
- If you could return...

172
00:09:22,348 --> 00:09:24,260
Company insurance,
let's get an assessment...

173
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:26,371
So, what's the problem, Driver Joe?

174
00:09:26,471 --> 00:09:28,830
We're stabilising the engine feeds,
won't take long.

175
00:09:28,930 --> 00:09:32,381
Um, no, cos that's the engine feed,
that light there, and it's fine,

176
00:09:32,481 --> 00:09:35,209
and it's a micropetrol engine,
so stabilising doesn't make sense?

177
00:09:35,309 --> 00:09:38,232
Soory, I'm a doctor. I'm very clever.
So what's wrong?

178
00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:41,236
We just stopped, look, all systems fine
and everything's working,

179
00:09:41,336 --> 00:09:42,850
but we're not moving.

180
00:09:43,325 --> 00:09:45,967
You're right.
No faults. And who are you?

181
00:09:46,348 --> 00:09:48,940
Claude, I'm the mechanic. Trainee.

182
00:09:49,352 --> 00:09:50,684
Nice to meet you.

183
00:09:50,784 --> 00:09:54,077
I've sent a distress signal. They should
dispatch a rescue truck, top speed.

184
00:09:54,177 --> 00:09:56,345
- How long till they get here?
- About an hour.

185
00:09:56,642 --> 00:09:58,681
Well, since we're waiting...

186
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:01,173
shall we take a look outside?

187
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:04,550
Lift the screens a bit?

188
00:10:04,858 --> 00:10:07,790
It's 100% X-tonic out there,
we'd be vaporised.

189
00:10:07,890 --> 00:10:11,828
No, those windows are Finitoglass,
give you a couple of minutes. Go on!

190
00:10:12,541 --> 00:10:13,860
Live a little!

191
00:10:28,534 --> 00:10:30,025
<i>That is beautiful...</i>

192
00:10:30,758 --> 00:10:32,310
<i>Look at all those diamonds!</i>

193
00:10:32,597 --> 00:10:35,044
<i>Poisoned by the sun.
No-one can ever touch them.</i>

194
00:10:35,144 --> 00:10:36,912
Joe, you said we took a detour?

195
00:10:37,012 --> 00:10:39,942
- Just 40 kliks to the west.
- Is that a recognised path?

196
00:10:40,042 --> 00:10:42,972
No, it's a new one, the computer
worked it out, on automatic.

197
00:10:43,266 --> 00:10:44,736
So we're the first?

198
00:10:45,362 --> 00:10:46,707
<i>This piece of ground.</i>

199
00:10:47,314 --> 00:10:49,125
<i>No-one's ever been here before.</i>

200
00:10:50,795 --> 00:10:53,148
<i>Not in the whole of recorded history.</i>

201
00:10:53,248 --> 00:10:54,305
Did you just...?

202
00:10:56,069 --> 00:10:58,945
- No, sorry. Nothing.
- What did you see?

203
00:10:59,045 --> 00:11:00,510
Just there. That ridge.

204
00:11:01,035 --> 00:11:03,749
<i>Like... a shadow. Just for a second.</i>

205
00:11:04,006 --> 00:11:05,300
What sort of shadow?

206
00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:07,582
X-tonic rising!

207
00:11:07,821 --> 00:11:08,991
Shields down.

208
00:11:10,974 --> 00:11:13,470
Look, there he is, look, there!
- Where ?

209
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:15,979
What was it?

210
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:19,378
Like, just, something...
shifting, something sort of... dark.

211
00:11:19,798 --> 00:11:21,293
Like it was... running.

212
00:11:21,756 --> 00:11:23,185
Running which way?

213
00:11:23,533 --> 00:11:25,060
Towards us.

214
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:29,305
Doctor, back to your seat
and not a word, rescue's on its way.

215
00:11:29,610 --> 00:11:31,775
<i>If you could close the door,
thank you.</i>

216
00:11:35,833 --> 00:11:38,536
What did they say? Did they tell you?
What is it, what's wrong?

217
00:11:38,636 --> 00:11:40,670
Oh, just stabilising,
happens all the time.

218
00:11:40,907 --> 00:11:42,127
I don't need this.

219
00:11:42,334 --> 00:11:44,655
I'm on a schedule.
This is completely unnecessary!

220
00:11:44,755 --> 00:11:46,466
Back to your seats, thank you.

221
00:11:50,270 --> 00:11:51,596
Excuse me, Doctor,

222
00:11:52,669 --> 00:11:54,510
but they're micropetrol
engines, aren't they?

223
00:11:54,610 --> 00:11:56,977
- Now, don't bother the man.
- My father was a mechanic.

224
00:11:57,689 --> 00:12:00,621
Micropetrol doesn't stabilise,
what does 'stabilise' mean?

225
00:12:00,954 --> 00:12:03,460
Well. Bit of flim-flam.
Don't worry, they're sorting it out.

226
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:06,193
- So it's not the engines?
- Just a little pause, that's all.

227
00:12:06,487 --> 00:12:07,679
<i>How much air have we got?</i>

228
00:12:07,779 --> 00:12:08,667
Professor, it's fine.

229
00:12:08,767 --> 00:12:09,975
- What did he say?
- Nothing!

230
00:12:10,075 --> 00:12:12,371
- Are we running out of air?
- I was just speculating...

231
00:12:12,471 --> 00:12:15,262
- Right miss? Are we running out of air?
- Is that the Captain said?

232
00:12:15,362 --> 00:12:16,538
If you could remain calm...

233
00:12:16,638 --> 00:12:18,415
- How much air have we got?
- Mum, stop it.

234
00:12:18,515 --> 00:12:20,775
- Everything's under control.
- Doesn't look like it!

235
00:12:20,875 --> 00:12:21,551
He said it.

236
00:12:21,651 --> 00:12:23,572
Fine, the air is on a circular filter...

237
00:12:23,672 --> 00:12:26,065
- He started it!
- Everyone...

238
00:12:27,885 --> 00:12:29,310
QUIET!

239
00:12:34,202 --> 00:12:35,097
Thank you.

240
00:12:36,029 --> 00:12:38,932
Now, if you'd care to listen
to my good friend Dee Dee...

241
00:12:40,859 --> 00:12:41,535
Oh!

242
00:12:42,319 --> 00:12:43,164
Um...

243
00:12:43,508 --> 00:12:44,559
It's just that...

244
00:12:44,659 --> 00:12:48,745
Well, the air's on a circular filter so,
we could stay breathing for ten years.

245
00:12:49,495 --> 00:12:50,415
<i>There you go!</i>

246
00:12:50,982 --> 00:12:54,730
And I've spoken to the Captain,
I can guarantee you, everything's fine.

247
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:02,719
What was that?

248
00:13:02,819 --> 00:13:05,328
It must be the metal.
We're cooling down,

249
00:13:05,628 --> 00:13:07,940
- it's just settling...
- Rocks. Could be rocks falling.

250
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:10,427
What I want to know is,
how long do we have to sit here.

251
00:13:12,690 --> 00:13:14,279
- What is that?
- Someone's out there!

252
00:13:14,379 --> 00:13:16,694
- Don't be ridiculous!
- Like I said, it could be rocks.

253
00:13:16,794 --> 00:13:19,580
We're in the open.
Nothing could fall against the sides.

254
00:13:21,505 --> 00:13:22,740
Knock knock.

255
00:13:23,282 --> 00:13:24,502
Who's there?

256
00:13:30,627 --> 00:13:32,191
<i>Is there something out there?</i>

257
00:13:33,090 --> 00:13:35,144
Well? Anyone?

258
00:13:36,645 --> 00:13:38,134
What the hell is making that noise?

259
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:41,087
I'm sorry, but the light
out there is X-tonic,

260
00:13:41,557 --> 00:13:45,738
<i>that means it would destroy
any living thing, in a split-second.</i>

261
00:13:45,838 --> 00:13:50,099
<i>It is impossible for
someone to be outside.</i>

262
00:13:54,622 --> 00:13:56,153
What the hell is that, then?!

263
00:13:56,723 --> 00:13:58,922
Sir! You really should
get back to your seat.

264
00:14:04,434 --> 00:14:05,410
Hello?

265
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,290
It's moving...

266
00:14:16,330 --> 00:14:17,350
It's trying the door.

267
00:14:17,450 --> 00:14:21,667
There is no 'it',
there's nothing out there. Can't be.

268
00:14:36,964 --> 00:14:38,609
That's the entrance. Can it get in?

269
00:14:38,709 --> 00:14:40,943
No, that door's on 200
weight of hydraulics.

270
00:14:41,043 --> 00:14:44,465
- Stop it. Don't encourage them.
- What do you think it is?

271
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:46,625
- Biff, don't...
- Mr Cane, better not...

272
00:14:47,779 --> 00:14:49,028
It's cast iron, that door...

273
00:14:53,294 --> 00:14:55,983
Three times! Did you hear that,
it did it three times?!

274
00:14:56,083 --> 00:14:57,725
- It answered!
- It did it three times!

275
00:14:57,825 --> 00:14:59,314
All right, everyone, calm down.

276
00:14:59,414 --> 00:15:04,095
No, but it answered, don't tell me
that thing's not alive, it answered him!

277
00:15:05,203 --> 00:15:08,430
I really must insist,
you get back to your seats...

278
00:15:08,530 --> 00:15:10,852
No! Don't just stand there
telling us the rules!

279
00:15:10,952 --> 00:15:12,103
You're the hostess,

280
00:15:12,203 --> 00:15:14,225
you're supposed to do something!

281
00:15:25,770 --> 00:15:27,312
What the hell's making that noise?

282
00:15:27,846 --> 00:15:31,524
She said she'd get me. Stop it,
make it stop, somebody make it stop!

283
00:15:31,906 --> 00:15:35,303
Don't stand there looking at me, not
my fault, he started it with stories.

284
00:15:35,403 --> 00:15:37,129
- Calm down!
- He made it worse.

285
00:15:37,229 --> 00:15:39,989
- Why couldn't you leave it alone?
- Stop staring at me!

286
00:15:40,089 --> 00:15:42,370
- Just tell me what it is.
- Calm down!

287
00:15:45,639 --> 00:15:46,987
It's coming for me,

288
00:15:47,869 --> 00:15:50,828
it's coming for me,
it's coming for me...

289
00:15:51,754 --> 00:15:55,714
It's coming for me!
It's coming for me.

290
00:15:58,220 --> 00:15:59,360
Get out of there!

291
00:16:21,010 --> 00:16:21,580
OK?

292
00:16:27,850 --> 00:16:29,831
Arms. Legs. Neck.
Head. Nose. I'm fine...

293
00:16:31,107 --> 00:16:32,409
Everyone else?

294
00:16:34,615 --> 00:16:37,380
How are we?
Everyone all right?

295
00:16:37,812 --> 00:16:39,676
<i>Earthquake, must be...</i>

296
00:16:39,776 --> 00:16:42,817
But that's impossible,
the ground is fixed, it's solid.

297
00:16:42,917 --> 00:16:46,979
Got torches, everyone take a torch,
they're in the back of the seats.

298
00:16:50,796 --> 00:16:53,638
Oh, Jethro, sweetheart, come here...

299
00:16:53,738 --> 00:16:55,734
Never mind me, what about her?

300
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:00,351
<i>- What happened to the seats?
- Who did that?</i>

301
00:17:00,451 --> 00:17:01,755
<i>They've been ripped up.</i>

302
00:17:04,211 --> 00:17:06,778
It's all right, it's all right,
it's all right, it's over.

303
00:17:07,210 --> 00:17:08,417
We're still alive...

304
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:10,457
<i>Look, the wall's still intact.
D'you see?</i>

305
00:17:10,557 --> 00:17:12,460
- Joe, Claude?
- We're safe.

306
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:14,192
Driver Joe, can you hear me?

307
00:17:14,686 --> 00:17:17,629
I'm not getting any response,
the intercom must be down.

308
00:17:25,559 --> 00:17:26,829
What happened? What was that?

309
00:17:26,929 --> 00:17:28,980
Is it the driver?
Have we lost the driver?

310
00:17:29,713 --> 00:17:31,684
- The cabin's gone.
- Don't be ridiculous.

311
00:17:31,784 --> 00:17:34,606
- It can't be gone, how can it be gone?
- Well, you saw it!

312
00:17:34,706 --> 00:17:37,262
There was nothing there,
like it was ripped away.

313
00:17:37,362 --> 00:17:38,480
What are you doing?

314
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:40,520
That's bit of light, thank you.
Molto bene!

315
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:43,385
- You know what you're doing?
- Cabin's gone, leave that wall alone.

316
00:17:43,485 --> 00:17:44,662
The cabin can't be gone!

317
00:17:44,762 --> 00:17:48,110
No, it's safe, any rupture
would automatically seal itself...

318
00:17:50,325 --> 00:17:51,908
But something sliced it off.

319
00:17:53,818 --> 00:17:56,540
- You're right. The cabin's gone.
- But if it gets separated...

320
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:57,967
<i>It loses integrity.</i>

321
00:18:01,058 --> 00:18:03,135
I'm sorry. They've been reduced to dust.

322
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:05,739
<i>The driver and the mechanic.</i>

323
00:18:07,272 --> 00:18:08,893
But they sent a distress signal.

324
00:18:08,993 --> 00:18:10,701
Help is on its way.
They saved our lives!

325
00:18:10,801 --> 00:18:12,740
We're gonna get out of here, I promise.

326
00:18:13,141 --> 00:18:15,260
<i>We're still alive,
and they're gonna find us.</i>

327
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:16,652
Doctor. Look at her.

328
00:18:19,387 --> 00:18:21,864
Right, yes, sorry...
Have we got a medical kit?

329
00:18:22,164 --> 00:18:23,396
Why won't she turn around?

330
00:18:26,286 --> 00:18:30,420
- What's her name?
- Silvestry. Mrs Sky Silvestry.

331
00:18:32,042 --> 00:18:32,862
Sky?

332
00:18:34,019 --> 00:18:35,045
Can you hear me?

333
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:36,947
Are you all right?

334
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:40,801
Can you move, Sky?

335
00:18:42,785 --> 00:18:43,748
Just look at me.

336
00:18:46,714 --> 00:18:48,316
That noise, from outside...

337
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:52,139
- it's stopped.
- Well, thank God for that.

338
00:18:52,239 --> 00:18:54,108
But what if it's
not outside any more?

339
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:58,290
- What if it's inside?
- Inside? Where?

340
00:18:59,295 --> 00:19:00,590
It was heading for her.

341
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:02,631
<i>Sky...</i>

342
00:19:03,851 --> 00:19:05,090
it's all right, Sky.

343
00:19:07,336 --> 00:19:08,850
I just want you to turn around,

344
00:19:09,357 --> 00:19:10,220
face me.

345
00:19:47,555 --> 00:19:48,337
Sky?

346
00:19:50,881 --> 00:19:51,707
Sky?

347
00:19:53,658 --> 00:19:55,929
- Are you all right?
- Are you all right?

348
00:19:56,111 --> 00:19:58,020
- Are you hurt?
- Are you hurt?

349
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:01,066
- You don't have to talk.
- You don't have to talk.

350
00:20:01,441 --> 00:20:03,500
- I'm trying to help.
- I'm trying to help.

351
00:20:03,794 --> 00:20:06,289
- My name's the Doctor.
- My name's the Doctor.

352
00:20:06,621 --> 00:20:08,986
- OK, can you stop?
- OK, can you stop?

353
00:20:09,086 --> 00:20:11,146
- I'd like you to stop.
- I'd like you to stop.

354
00:20:11,246 --> 00:20:13,425
- Why's she doing that?
- Why's she doing that?

355
00:20:13,525 --> 00:20:15,011
- She's gone mad.
- She's gone mad.

356
00:20:15,111 --> 00:20:17,320
- Stop it. I said stop it!
- Stop it. I said stop it!

357
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:19,460
- I Don't think she can.
- I Don't think she can.

358
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:21,893
- Stop it, this isn't funny.
- Stop it, this isn't funny.

359
00:20:21,993 --> 00:20:23,982
- Sh, sh, all of you.
- Sh, sh, all of you.

360
00:20:24,082 --> 00:20:25,712
- My name's Jethro!
- My name's Jethro!

361
00:20:25,812 --> 00:20:28,585
- Jethro, leave it, shut up!
- Jethro, leave it, shut up!

362
00:20:34,864 --> 00:20:37,842
- Why are you repeating?
- Why are you repeating?

363
00:20:40,714 --> 00:20:43,140
- What is that, learning?
- What is that, learning?

364
00:20:43,746 --> 00:20:45,471
- Copying?
- Copying?

365
00:20:47,804 --> 00:20:49,869
- Absorbing?
- Absorbing?

366
00:20:52,828 --> 00:20:55,312
- The square root of pi is...
- The square root of pi is...

367
00:20:55,412 --> 00:21:00,705
- 1.77245385090551602729816748...
- 1.77245385090551602729816748...

368
00:21:00,805 --> 00:21:03,140
- 3341. Wow!
- 3341. Wow!

369
00:21:08,165 --> 00:21:10,156
- That's impossible.
- That's impossible.

370
00:21:10,256 --> 00:21:12,008
- She couldn't repeat all that.
- She...

371
00:21:12,108 --> 00:21:13,422
"Tell her to stop!"

372
00:21:13,522 --> 00:21:15,200
"She's driving me mad."

373
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:16,577
"Make her STOP!"

374
00:21:16,677 --> 00:21:19,223
"Stop her staring at me, shut her up..."

375
00:21:21,088 --> 00:21:22,827
"Telling you, whatever your name is."

376
00:21:22,927 --> 00:21:24,364
"Stop it..."

377
00:21:25,290 --> 00:21:27,617
"What's wrong with her eyes?"

378
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:35,896
"Six, six, six."

379
00:21:45,997 --> 00:21:48,300
- That's the back-up system.
- Well!

380
00:21:48,994 --> 00:21:49,920
That's a bit better.

381
00:21:50,083 --> 00:21:53,574
- What about rescue, how long's?
- About 60 minutes, that's all.

382
00:21:54,406 --> 00:21:57,420
Then I suggest we all calm down.

383
00:21:57,835 --> 00:21:59,568
<i>This panic isn't helping.</i>

384
00:22:00,181 --> 00:22:04,701
<i>That poor woman is evidently
in a state of self-induced hysteria,</i>

385
00:22:04,801 --> 00:22:06,543
- we should leave her alone.
- Doctor...

386
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:08,224
I know.

387
00:22:08,965 --> 00:22:10,837
Doctor, now step back,

388
00:22:11,512 --> 00:22:13,420
I think you should leave her...

389
00:22:14,444 --> 00:22:15,221
Alone.

390
00:22:18,816 --> 00:22:20,113
What's she doing?

391
00:22:21,654 --> 00:22:22,921
How can she do that?

392
00:22:23,021 --> 00:22:26,060
She's talking with you...
and with me!

393
00:22:26,570 --> 00:22:27,601
Oh, my God!

394
00:22:28,412 --> 00:22:29,353
Biff, what's she doing?

395
00:22:29,453 --> 00:22:30,481
She's repeating...

396
00:22:31,697 --> 00:22:34,427
- At exactly the same time.
- That's impossible.

397
00:22:34,527 --> 00:22:37,820
-There's not even a delay.
- Ohh man, that is weird.

398
00:22:38,005 --> 00:22:41,665
I think you should all be very,
very quiet, have you got that?

399
00:22:41,765 --> 00:22:43,878
- How's she doing it?
- Mrs Cane, please, be quiet.

400
00:22:43,978 --> 00:22:47,133
But how can she do that?
She's got my voice, she's got my words!

401
00:22:47,233 --> 00:22:49,445
Sweetheart, be quiet, just...
hush now. Hush.

402
00:22:50,528 --> 00:22:52,609
- She's doing it to me!
- Just stop it, all of you.

403
00:22:52,709 --> 00:22:53,762
Stop it. Please.

404
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:03,730
Now then, Sky. Are you Sky?

405
00:23:04,785 --> 00:23:06,318
Is Sky still in there?

406
00:23:06,418 --> 00:23:07,754
Mrs Silvestry?

407
00:23:10,894 --> 00:23:14,290
You know exactly what I'm going to say,
how are you doing that?

408
00:23:17,364 --> 00:23:18,544
Roast beef!

409
00:23:19,476 --> 00:23:20,452
Bananas!

410
00:23:21,403 --> 00:23:23,155
The Medusa Cascade.

411
00:23:26,289 --> 00:23:27,078
Bang!

412
00:23:27,447 --> 00:23:29,902
Rose Tyler, Martha Jones,
Donna Noble, TARDIS!

413
00:23:32,749 --> 00:23:35,489
Shamble bobble dibble dooble.

414
00:23:36,822 --> 00:23:39,226
Oh, Doctor, you're so handsome.
Yes, I am, thank you.

415
00:23:42,211 --> 00:23:45,370
A, B, C, D, E, F, G,
H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O...

416
00:23:51,444 --> 00:23:54,585
First she repeats. Then she catches up.
What's the next stage?

417
00:23:54,685 --> 00:23:56,061
Next stage of what?

418
00:23:56,161 --> 00:23:59,619
But that's not her, is it?
That's not Mrs Silvestry any more.

419
00:24:00,056 --> 00:24:01,824
I don't think so, no.

420
00:24:05,303 --> 00:24:06,292
I think...

421
00:24:07,268 --> 00:24:09,614
the more we talk,
the more she learns.

422
00:24:09,714 --> 00:24:12,148
Now, I'm all for education,
but in this case...

423
00:24:13,393 --> 00:24:16,881
maybe not. Let's just... move back.
Come on. Come with me.

424
00:24:16,981 --> 00:24:19,025
Everyone, get back,
all of you, as far as you can.

425
00:24:19,125 --> 00:24:20,526
Doctor, make her stop.

426
00:24:20,923 --> 00:24:23,044
Val, come on,
come to the back, stop looking at her,

427
00:24:23,144 --> 00:24:25,540
come on, Jethro, you too,
everyone, come on...

428
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:27,783
50 minutes. That's all we need.

429
00:24:27,883 --> 00:24:29,910
50 minutes till
the rescue arrives. And...

430
00:24:30,204 --> 00:24:33,470
she's not exactly strong, look at her,
all she's got is our voices.

431
00:24:33,845 --> 00:24:35,723
I can't look at her.
It's those eyes.

432
00:24:40,903 --> 00:24:42,743
We must not look at goblin men.

433
00:24:45,895 --> 00:24:49,468
- What's that supposed to mean?
- It's a poem. Christina Rossetti.

434
00:24:55,268 --> 00:24:58,193
We must not look at goblin men.
We must not buy their fruits.

435
00:24:58,293 --> 00:25:01,916
Who knows upon what soil they fed.
Their hungry, thirsty roots?

436
00:25:03,493 --> 00:25:04,694
I don't think that's helping.

437
00:25:04,794 --> 00:25:08,540
She's not a goblin, or a monster,
she's just a very sick woman.

438
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:11,739
- Maybe that's why it went for her.
- There is no 'it!'

439
00:25:11,839 --> 00:25:14,430
Think about it. That knocking,
went all the way round the bus.

440
00:25:14,530 --> 00:25:15,599
Till it found her.

441
00:25:15,881 --> 00:25:18,072
And she was the most scared,
out of all of us.

442
00:25:19,361 --> 00:25:21,980
Maybe that's what it needed.

443
00:25:22,614 --> 00:25:24,917
- That's how it got in.
- For the last time!

444
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:28,417
Nothing can live
on the surface of Midnight.

445
00:25:28,517 --> 00:25:31,483
Professor, I'm glad you've got
a definition of life in the universe,

446
00:25:31,583 --> 00:25:34,086
but perhaps the universe
has got ideas of its own, mm?

447
00:25:34,186 --> 00:25:35,933
Now trust me. I've got previous!

448
00:25:36,322 --> 00:25:38,023
I think there might well be some...

449
00:25:38,229 --> 00:25:41,439
consciousness inside Mrs Silvestry,
but maybe SHE's still in there.

450
00:25:41,539 --> 00:25:44,436
- It's our job to help her.
- You can help her, I'm not going near.

451
00:25:44,536 --> 00:25:45,768
No, I've got to stay back.

452
00:25:45,868 --> 00:25:48,578
If she's copying us,
maybe the final stage is becoming us.

453
00:25:48,678 --> 00:25:51,428
I don't want her becoming me,
or things could get a lot worse.

454
00:25:51,528 --> 00:25:54,403
- Oh, like you're so special.
- As it happens, yes, I am.

455
00:25:54,503 --> 00:25:56,868
So that's decided.
We stay back. And we wait.

456
00:25:57,100 --> 00:25:59,365
When the rescue ship comes,
we can get her to hospital.

457
00:26:01,730 --> 00:26:03,100
We should throw her out.

458
00:26:04,846 --> 00:26:06,229
I beg your pardon?

459
00:26:08,237 --> 00:26:09,970
- Can we do that?
- Don't be ridiculous.

460
00:26:10,070 --> 00:26:11,672
That thing, whatever it is,

461
00:26:11,772 --> 00:26:14,869
killed the driver, and the mechanic,
and I don't think she's finished yet.

462
00:26:14,969 --> 00:26:17,522
- She can't even move!
- Look, look at her eyes!

463
00:26:17,891 --> 00:26:21,060
She killed Joe,
and she killed Claude, and we're next.

464
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:23,451
She's still doing it. Just stop it!

465
00:26:23,551 --> 00:26:25,100
Stop talking!! STOP IT!!!

466
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,861
- Biff, don't, sweetheart!
- She won't stop!

467
00:26:28,896 --> 00:26:31,417
We can't throw her out though,
we can't even open the doors.

468
00:26:31,517 --> 00:26:33,382
No-one is getting thrown out!

469
00:26:41,029 --> 00:26:42,036
Yes, we can.

470
00:26:42,650 --> 00:26:44,194
<i>Cos there's an air pressure seal.</i>

471
00:26:44,515 --> 00:26:45,829
Like when you opened cabin door,

472
00:26:45,929 --> 00:26:47,924
you weren't pulled out,
you had a couple of sec,

473
00:26:48,024 --> 00:26:50,509
<i>cos it takes the pressure-wall
about six seconds to collapse.</i>

474
00:26:50,609 --> 00:26:52,517
Well, six seconds exactly.

475
00:26:53,186 --> 00:26:55,332
That's enough time to throw someone out.

476
00:26:55,808 --> 00:26:58,811
- Thanks, Dee Dee, just what we needed.
- Would it kill her? Outside?

477
00:26:58,911 --> 00:27:01,903
I don't know, but she's got a body now,
it would kill the physical form.

478
00:27:02,003 --> 00:27:04,150
No-one is killing anyone!

479
00:27:04,250 --> 00:27:06,855
I wouldn't risk the cabin door twice.
But we've got that one.

480
00:27:06,955 --> 00:27:09,288
All we need to do is grab hold
of her and throw her out.

481
00:27:09,388 --> 00:27:12,268
Now, listen! For all we know,
that's a brand new lifeform over there.

482
00:27:12,368 --> 00:27:14,945
And if it's come inside to discover us,
than what's it found?

483
00:27:15,352 --> 00:27:18,537
This little bunch of humans,
what d'you amount to?

484
00:27:19,281 --> 00:27:21,897
A murder? Cos this is where you decide.

485
00:27:21,997 --> 00:27:23,699
You decide who you are.

486
00:27:23,893 --> 00:27:26,865
Could you actually murder her?
Any of you?

487
00:27:27,371 --> 00:27:28,022
Really?

488
00:27:30,181 --> 00:27:31,860
Or are you better than that?

489
00:27:40,488 --> 00:27:41,340
I'd do it.

490
00:27:41,508 --> 00:27:42,503
- So would I.
- And me.

491
00:27:42,841 --> 00:27:44,155
- I think we should.
- What?!

492
00:27:44,255 --> 00:27:45,950
- I want her out.
- You can't say that!

493
00:27:46,050 --> 00:27:49,104
I'm sorry, but you said it yourself,
Doctor, she is growing in strength.

494
00:27:49,204 --> 00:27:51,472
- That's not what I said!
- I want to go home.

495
00:27:51,904 --> 00:27:54,225
I'm sorry. I want to be safe.

496
00:27:54,325 --> 00:27:56,678
You'll be safe,
the rescue truck is on its way.

497
00:27:56,778 --> 00:27:58,217
<i>What happens then, Doctor?</i>

498
00:27:58,779 --> 00:28:00,904
If it takes that thing back to
the Leisure Palace,

499
00:28:01,004 --> 00:28:03,464
if that thing reaches civilisation,
what if it spreads?

500
00:28:03,564 --> 00:28:05,969
When we get back to the base,
I'll be there to contain it.

501
00:28:06,069 --> 00:28:08,870
- You haven't done much so far!
- You'r standing with the rest of us!

502
00:28:08,970 --> 00:28:10,096
<i>She's dangerous.</i>

503
00:28:10,522 --> 00:28:13,620
It's my job to see this vessel is safe.
We should get rid of her.

504
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:17,522
Now hang on, I think, perhaps,
we're all going a little bit too far.

505
00:28:17,622 --> 00:28:20,587
- At last! Thank you.
- Two people are dead!

506
00:28:20,687 --> 00:28:22,121
Don't make it a third!

507
00:28:25,693 --> 00:28:27,064
Jethro, what d'you say?

508
00:28:27,433 --> 00:28:29,041
- I'm not killing anyone.
- Thank you.

509
00:28:29,141 --> 00:28:31,024
- He's just a boy!
- What, I don't get a vote?

510
00:28:31,124 --> 00:28:33,100
There isn't a vote,
it's not happening! Ever.

511
00:28:34,596 --> 00:28:37,752
If you try to throw her out that door,
you'll have to get past me first.

512
00:28:41,268 --> 00:28:43,383
- OK.
- Fine by me.

513
00:28:43,483 --> 00:28:45,962
Oh, now you're being stupid.
Just think about it!

514
00:28:46,062 --> 00:28:48,696
Could you take someone
and throw them out of that door?

515
00:28:48,796 --> 00:28:49,625
Calling me a coward?

516
00:28:49,725 --> 00:28:51,620
- Who put you in charge?
- I'm sorry, but...

517
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:53,723
you're a Doctor of what, exactly?

518
00:28:53,823 --> 00:28:55,074
He wasn't even booked in.

519
00:28:55,174 --> 00:28:58,922
Rest of you, tickets in advance.
He just turned up, out of the blue.

520
00:28:59,122 --> 00:29:00,197
<i>Where from?</i>

521
00:29:00,591 --> 00:29:01,880
I'm just... travelling,

522
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:03,825
- I'm a traveller..
- Like an immigrant?

523
00:29:03,925 --> 00:29:07,342
Who were you talking to?
Before you got on board, who was that?

524
00:29:07,442 --> 00:29:08,432
Just Donna, my friend.

525
00:29:08,532 --> 00:29:10,754
- What were you saying her?
- Hasn't told us his name.

526
00:29:10,854 --> 00:29:13,200
Thing is, Doctor,
you've been loving this.

527
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:14,827
Oh, Jethro, not you.

528
00:29:14,927 --> 00:29:17,786
No, but ever since all the trouble
started, you've been loving it.

529
00:29:17,886 --> 00:29:21,545
It has to be said,
you do seem to have a certain...glee.

530
00:29:21,645 --> 00:29:24,171
All right, I'm interested,
yes, I can't help it,

531
00:29:24,271 --> 00:29:26,542
cos whatever's inside her,
it's brand new,

532
00:29:26,642 --> 00:29:29,120
- and that's fascinating.
- What, you wanted this to happen?

533
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:29,655
No!

534
00:29:29,755 --> 00:29:32,133
You were talking to her,
on your own, before the trouble,

535
00:29:32,233 --> 00:29:34,855
right at the front, you were
talking to that Sky woman,

536
00:29:34,955 --> 00:29:37,103
- the two of you together, I saw you.
- We all did!

537
00:29:37,203 --> 00:29:39,174
- You went in the cabin!
- What you said to her?

538
00:29:39,274 --> 00:29:40,723
- I was talking!
- Saying what?

539
00:29:40,823 --> 00:29:42,762
You called us humans
like you're not one of us.

540
00:29:42,862 --> 00:29:44,915
- He did! That's what he said!
- And the wiring,

541
00:29:45,015 --> 00:29:47,035
he went into that panel
and opened up the wiring.

542
00:29:47,135 --> 00:29:48,030
That was after.

543
00:29:48,130 --> 00:29:51,035
- But how did you know what to do?
- Because I'm clever.

544
00:29:56,355 --> 00:29:58,365
I see. Well.

545
00:29:58,909 --> 00:30:00,329
That makes things clear.

546
00:30:00,429 --> 00:30:02,375
And what are we, then? Idiots?

547
00:30:02,475 --> 00:30:03,445
That's not what I meant.

548
00:30:03,545 --> 00:30:04,834
If you're clever what are we?

549
00:30:04,934 --> 00:30:07,190
You've looked down on us
from the moment we walked in.

550
00:30:07,290 --> 00:30:09,562
Even if he goes,
he's practically volunteered.

551
00:30:09,662 --> 00:30:12,628
Oh come on,
just listen to yourself, please!

552
00:30:12,728 --> 00:30:13,519
D'you mean...?

553
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:15,577
We throw him out as well?

554
00:30:23,527 --> 00:30:24,427
If we have to.

555
00:30:25,572 --> 00:30:26,486
Look, just...

556
00:30:27,424 --> 00:30:29,500
Right, sorry, yes, hold on, just...

557
00:30:30,690 --> 00:30:34,499
I know, you're scared,
and so am I, look at me, I am.

558
00:30:34,815 --> 00:30:38,835
But we have all got to calm down
and cool off and think.

559
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:40,912
Perhaps you could tell us your name.

560
00:30:41,012 --> 00:30:42,932
- What does it matter?
- Then tell us.

561
00:30:44,615 --> 00:30:46,372
- John Smith.
- Your real name.

562
00:30:46,472 --> 00:30:48,950
He's lying, look at his face.
His eyes are the same as hers.

563
00:30:49,050 --> 00:30:50,902
- Tell us?!
- He's been lying to us,

564
00:30:51,002 --> 00:30:51,934
right from the start.

565
00:30:52,034 --> 00:30:53,417
No-one's called John Smith!

566
00:30:53,517 --> 00:30:55,263
Now listen to me right now!

567
00:30:55,363 --> 00:30:58,919
You need me, all of you, if we're going
to get out of this, then you need me.

568
00:30:59,019 --> 00:31:01,510
So you keep saying!
You've repeated yourself more than her.

569
00:31:01,610 --> 00:31:04,331
If anyone's in charge, it should be
the Professor, he's the expert!

570
00:31:04,431 --> 00:31:06,239
Stop, just look...

571
00:31:06,415 --> 00:31:08,338
- You keep out of this, Jethro.
- Look at her!

572
00:31:08,751 --> 00:31:09,890
She's stopped...

573
00:31:15,352 --> 00:31:18,299
When did she...?
No, she hasn't, she's still doing it.

574
00:31:18,555 --> 00:31:19,950
<i>She looks the same to me...</i>

575
00:31:20,321 --> 00:31:22,555
No, she's stopped!

576
00:31:23,387 --> 00:31:25,353
<i>Look, I'm talking, and she's not!</i>

577
00:31:25,453 --> 00:31:26,636
<i>What about me? Is she?</i>

578
00:31:26,736 --> 00:31:30,470
Look! Look at that!
She's not doing me, she's let me go!

579
00:31:30,730 --> 00:31:32,085
Mrs Silvestry?

580
00:31:34,253 --> 00:31:35,899
Nor me! Nothing!

581
00:31:37,175 --> 00:31:38,107
Sky?

582
00:31:39,302 --> 00:31:40,235
What are you doing?

583
00:31:40,335 --> 00:31:41,792
She's still doing him!

584
00:31:43,050 --> 00:31:45,912
Doctor. It's you.
She's only copying you.

585
00:31:47,157 --> 00:31:49,547
Why me? Why are you doing this?

586
00:31:49,647 --> 00:31:53,507
She won't leave him alone!
D'you see? I said so, she's with him.

587
00:31:53,607 --> 00:31:55,726
- They're together!
- How d'you explain it, Doctor?

588
00:31:55,895 --> 00:31:58,079
- If you're so clever.
- I don't know.

589
00:31:59,255 --> 00:32:00,562
Sky, stop it.

590
00:32:01,463 --> 00:32:03,534
I said stop it. Just stop it!

591
00:32:03,634 --> 00:32:05,094
<i>Look at the two of them...</i>

592
00:32:07,688 --> 00:32:10,630
Mrs Silvestry. I'm trying to understand.

593
00:32:11,617 --> 00:32:14,164
<i>You've captured my speech, what for?</i>

594
00:32:15,409 --> 00:32:16,791
What d'you need?

595
00:32:19,923 --> 00:32:22,401
You need my voice in particular.

596
00:32:22,688 --> 00:32:24,503
The cleverest voice in the room.

597
00:32:24,959 --> 00:32:27,996
Why? Cos I'm the only
one who can help?

598
00:32:28,834 --> 00:32:31,782
Oh, I'd love that to be true.
But your eyes.

599
00:32:32,714 --> 00:32:34,200
They're saying something else.

600
00:32:35,298 --> 00:32:38,958
Listen to me.
Whatever you want, if it's life,

601
00:32:39,058 --> 00:32:44,017
or form, or consciousness,
or voice, you don't have to steal it.

602
00:32:44,117 --> 00:32:46,770
You can find it
without hurting anyone.

603
00:32:47,828 --> 00:32:49,210
And I'll help you.

604
00:32:49,911 --> 00:32:51,409
That's a promise.

605
00:32:52,003 --> 00:32:52,692
So.

606
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:55,105
What d'you think?

607
00:32:56,381 --> 00:32:58,571
- Do we have a deal?
- Do we have a deal?

608
00:33:03,341 --> 00:33:05,825
- Hold on, did she...?
- She spoke first.

609
00:33:05,925 --> 00:33:06,810
She can't have.

610
00:33:06,910 --> 00:33:08,700
<i>- She did!
- She spoke first!</i>

611
00:33:11,464 --> 00:33:17,057
Oh, look at that, I'm ahead of you.
Oh, look at that, I'm ahead of you.

612
00:33:17,157 --> 00:33:21,355
Did you see? She spoke
before he did! Definitely!

613
00:33:21,580 --> 00:33:22,797
He's copying her.

614
00:33:23,929 --> 00:33:25,850
<i>Doctor? What's happening?</i>

615
00:33:25,950 --> 00:33:29,211
- I think it's moved.
- I think it's moved.

616
00:33:29,311 --> 00:33:32,277
- I think it's letting me go.
- I think it's letting me go.

617
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:36,502
<i>What do you mean?
Letting you go from what?</i>

618
00:33:36,602 --> 00:33:39,190
<i>But he's repeating now,
he's the one doing it! It's him!</i>

619
00:33:39,946 --> 00:33:41,078
<i>They're separating.</i>

620
00:33:41,816 --> 00:33:43,111
<i>Mrs Silvestry?</i>

621
00:33:44,112 --> 00:33:45,247
Is that you?

622
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:49,258
Yes, yes, it's me.

623
00:33:49,420 --> 00:33:50,859
Yes, yes, it's me...

624
00:33:50,959 --> 00:33:53,037
I'm coming back, listen.

625
00:33:53,137 --> 00:33:54,468
- I'm coming back...
- It's me!

626
00:33:54,568 --> 00:33:56,339
Listen. It's me!

627
00:33:56,790 --> 00:34:00,043
Like it's passed into the Doctor.
It's transferred. Whatever it is,

628
00:34:00,535 --> 00:34:01,790
it's gone inside him.

629
00:34:02,433 --> 00:34:04,961
No, that's not what happened.

630
00:34:09,524 --> 00:34:10,806
But look at her!

631
00:34:13,472 --> 00:34:16,287
Look at me, I can move...

632
00:34:16,387 --> 00:34:18,416
- Look at me...
- I can feel again...

633
00:34:18,591 --> 00:34:20,706
- I'm coming back to life.
- I can move...

634
00:34:20,806 --> 00:34:21,842
I can feel again.

635
00:34:21,942 --> 00:34:23,863
- And look at him.
- I'm coming back to life.

636
00:34:23,963 --> 00:34:27,380
- He can't move.
- And look at him, he can't move.

637
00:34:32,111 --> 00:34:33,963
- Help me.
- Help me.

638
00:34:34,063 --> 00:34:35,690
- Professor?
- Professor?

639
00:34:35,884 --> 00:34:38,868
<i>- Get me away from him.
- Get me away from him.</i>

640
00:34:39,050 --> 00:34:41,314
- Please.
- Please.

641
00:34:54,879 --> 00:34:57,325
<i>Oh, thank you.</i>

642
00:34:57,425 --> 00:34:59,290
Oh, thank you.

643
00:34:59,390 --> 00:35:00,628
<i>They've completely separated.</i>

644
00:35:00,728 --> 00:35:03,950
It's in him, d'you see?
I said it was him all the time.

645
00:35:04,050 --> 00:35:06,323
She's free! She's been saved!

646
00:35:06,423 --> 00:35:09,520
- Oh, it was so cold.
- Oh, it was so cold.

647
00:35:09,783 --> 00:35:12,163
- I couldn't breathe.
- I couldn't breathe.

648
00:35:12,263 --> 00:35:13,960
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.

649
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:15,816
I must've scared you, so much.

650
00:35:15,916 --> 00:35:17,712
<i>I must've scared you, so much.</i>

651
00:35:17,812 --> 00:35:21,325
No, no, it's all right,
I've got you, ooh, there you are,

652
00:35:21,425 --> 00:35:23,828
my love, it's gone,
everything's all right now.

653
00:35:23,928 --> 00:35:24,875
I wouldn't touch her.

654
00:35:24,975 --> 00:35:26,910
But it's gone, she's clean,
it passed into him.

655
00:35:27,010 --> 00:35:28,172
That's not what happened.

656
00:35:28,272 --> 00:35:30,024
Thank you for your opinion, Dee,

657
00:35:30,124 --> 00:35:33,270
but clearly, Mrs Silvestry
has been released.

658
00:35:33,370 --> 00:35:35,219
- No.
- Just leave her alone!

659
00:35:35,444 --> 00:35:37,164
She's safe, isn't she?

660
00:35:37,727 --> 00:35:41,030
- Jethro? It's let her go, hasn't it?
- I think so, yeah.

661
00:35:41,290 --> 00:35:43,670
Looks like it. Professor?

662
00:35:44,338 --> 00:35:46,553
I'd say, from observation...

663
00:35:46,966 --> 00:35:48,880
the Doctor can't move,

664
00:35:49,143 --> 00:35:52,190
and when she was possessed,
she couldn't move, so...

665
00:35:52,290 --> 00:35:53,494
Well, there we are then!

666
00:35:54,132 --> 00:35:56,860
Now the only problem
we've got is this Doctor.

667
00:35:58,236 --> 00:36:01,463
- It's inside his head.
- It's inside his head.

668
00:36:02,855 --> 00:36:05,408
- It killed the driver.
- It killed the driver.

669
00:36:05,508 --> 00:36:07,681
- And the mechanic.
- And the mechanic.

670
00:36:07,781 --> 00:36:09,298
And now it wants us.

671
00:36:09,398 --> 00:36:11,735
- And now it wants us.
- I said so!

672
00:36:11,897 --> 00:36:14,869
- He's waited so long.
- He's waited so long.

673
00:36:14,969 --> 00:36:16,602
- In the dark.
- In the dark.

674
00:36:16,702 --> 00:36:18,735
- And the cold.
- And the cold.

675
00:36:18,835 --> 00:36:21,200
- And the diamonds.
- And the diamonds.

676
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:23,547
- Until you came.
- Until you came.

677
00:36:23,647 --> 00:36:25,324
Bodies so hot.

678
00:36:25,424 --> 00:36:26,482
Bodies so hot.

679
00:36:26,582 --> 00:36:28,403
- With blood.
- With blood.

680
00:36:28,503 --> 00:36:30,229
- And pain.
- And pain.

681
00:36:30,329 --> 00:36:31,431
Someone make him stop.

682
00:36:31,531 --> 00:36:33,664
- But she's saying it!
- And you can shut up!

683
00:36:33,764 --> 00:36:36,367
It's not him, it's her,
he's just repeating!

684
00:36:36,467 --> 00:36:38,257
But that's what the
thing does, it repeats!

685
00:36:38,357 --> 00:36:40,428
- Let her talk.
- What do you know?

686
00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:41,811
Fat lot of good you've been!

687
00:36:41,911 --> 00:36:43,682
Just let her explain.

688
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:45,427
I think...

689
00:36:46,078 --> 00:36:47,702
I mean, from what I've seen...

690
00:36:47,802 --> 00:36:50,647
it repeats, then it synchronises,
then it goes on to the next stage

691
00:36:50,747 --> 00:36:52,630
that's exactly what
the Doctor said would...

692
00:36:52,730 --> 00:36:54,546
- What, and you're on his side?
- No!

693
00:36:54,646 --> 00:36:57,185
- The voice is the thing!
- And she's the voice!

694
00:36:57,374 --> 00:36:59,630
She stole it! Look at her!

695
00:37:00,164 --> 00:37:02,473
It's not possessing him,
it's draining him!

696
00:37:02,786 --> 00:37:03,843
She's got his voice...

697
00:37:03,943 --> 00:37:06,002
<i>That's not true,
I saw it pass into him,</i>

698
00:37:06,102 --> 00:37:07,991
- I saw it with my own eyes!
- So did I!

699
00:37:08,091 --> 00:37:10,250
- You didn't!
- It went from her, to him.

700
00:37:10,613 --> 00:37:11,852
You saw it, didn't you?

701
00:37:11,952 --> 00:37:13,698
- I don't know.
- Don't be stupid, Jethro,

702
00:37:13,798 --> 00:37:14,756
of course you did!

703
00:37:14,975 --> 00:37:17,310
- I suppose he was right next to her.
- Everyone saw it!

704
00:37:17,410 --> 00:37:19,192
<i>But you're just making it up!</i>

705
00:37:19,292 --> 00:37:22,832
I know what I saw,
and I saw her stealing his voice.

706
00:37:22,932 --> 00:37:24,759
She's as bad as him,
someone shut her up.

707
00:37:24,859 --> 00:37:26,292
I think you should be quiet, Dee.

708
00:37:26,392 --> 00:37:28,288
- I'm only saying...
- And that's an order!

709
00:37:28,819 --> 00:37:30,483
<i>You're making a fool of yourself!</i>

710
00:37:30,583 --> 00:37:33,486
Pretending you're an expert
in mechanics and hydraulics,

711
00:37:33,586 --> 00:37:38,191
<i>when I can tell you, you are
nothing more than average, at best!</i>

712
00:37:38,372 --> 00:37:40,125
Now shut up!

713
00:37:40,225 --> 00:37:42,449
- That's how he does it.
- That's how he does it.

714
00:37:42,549 --> 00:37:44,751
- He makes you fight.
- He makes you fight.

715
00:37:44,851 --> 00:37:47,810
- Creeps into your head.
- Creeps into your head.

716
00:37:47,910 --> 00:37:50,043
- And whispers.
- And whispers.

717
00:37:50,143 --> 00:37:51,350
- Listen.
- Listen.

718
00:37:51,620 --> 00:37:53,228
- Just listen.
- Just listen.

719
00:37:53,328 --> 00:37:55,343
- That's him.
- That's him.

720
00:37:55,443 --> 00:37:57,389
- Inside.
- Inside.

721
00:37:57,489 --> 00:37:59,910
- Get him out of my head!
- Yeah, we should throw him out!

722
00:38:00,010 --> 00:38:01,901
Don't just talk about it!
Don't be so useless!

723
00:38:02,001 --> 00:38:04,316
- Do something!
- I will! You watch me!

724
00:38:04,416 --> 00:38:05,555
<i>I'm gonna throw him out!</i>

725
00:38:05,655 --> 00:38:06,957
- Yes!
- Yes!

726
00:38:07,057 --> 00:38:08,703
- Throw him out!
- Throw him out!

727
00:38:08,803 --> 00:38:10,899
- Get rid of him!
- Get rid of him!

728
00:38:10,999 --> 00:38:12,551
- Now!
- Now!

729
00:38:14,371 --> 00:38:16,098
- Don't!
- It'll be you next!

730
00:38:17,237 --> 00:38:18,744
I don't think we should do this.

731
00:38:18,844 --> 00:38:21,172
It was your idea!
Professor, help me.

732
00:38:21,272 --> 00:38:22,155
I can't...

733
00:38:22,255 --> 00:38:24,926
- I'm not...
- What sort of a man are you? Come on!

734
00:38:25,026 --> 00:38:28,110
Throw him out!
Just do it, throw him out!

735
00:38:28,558 --> 00:38:30,103
- Professor, help me.
- Get him out!

736
00:38:30,203 --> 00:38:32,481
Grab hold of him...
Not like that!! Are you stupid?!!

737
00:38:32,581 --> 00:38:34,307
- Cast him out!
- Cast him out!

738
00:38:34,407 --> 00:38:36,260
- Into the sun!
- Into the sun!

739
00:38:37,370 --> 00:38:39,500
- And the night!
- And the night!

740
00:38:40,370 --> 00:38:42,833
Come on.
Don't just stand there!

741
00:38:42,933 --> 00:38:45,111
- Do something say!!
- Get him out!

742
00:38:45,211 --> 00:38:46,343
- Do it!
- Do it!

743
00:38:46,443 --> 00:38:48,168
- Do it now!
- Do it now!

744
00:38:48,268 --> 00:38:50,033
- Faster!
- Faster!

745
00:38:50,210 --> 00:38:50,960
Just do it!

746
00:38:51,060 --> 00:38:53,380
- That's the way!
- That's the way!

747
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:55,630
- You can do it!
- You can do it!

748
00:38:56,623 --> 00:39:00,676
- Molto bene!
- Molto bene!

749
00:39:00,776 --> 00:39:01,480
<i>Get him out!</i>

750
00:39:01,580 --> 00:39:04,612
- Allons-y!
- Allons-y!

751
00:39:04,850 --> 00:39:06,320
That's his voice.

752
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:09,100
- The starlight waits!
- She's taken his voice.

753
00:39:09,677 --> 00:39:12,004
- The emptiness!
- Get him out!

754
00:39:12,104 --> 00:39:13,931
The Midnight sky!

755
00:39:14,031 --> 00:39:15,426
<i>The Midnight sky!</i>

756
00:39:15,526 --> 00:39:16,552
It's her.

757
00:39:22,729 --> 00:39:24,645
She's taken his voice!

758
00:39:28,575 --> 00:39:34,005
One, two, three, four, five, six.

759
00:39:38,844 --> 00:39:40,927
It's gone, it's gone...

760
00:39:42,285 --> 00:39:44,143
It's gone, it's gone, it's gone...

761
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:45,560
It's gone.

762
00:39:46,058 --> 00:39:47,055
It's gone...

763
00:39:49,990 --> 00:39:51,575
<i>It's gone, it's gone, it's gone...</i>

764
00:39:52,274 --> 00:39:54,185
It's gone, it's gone, it's gone...

765
00:40:30,545 --> 00:40:31,745
I said it was her.

766
00:40:48,170 --> 00:40:51,775
20 MINUTES LATER...

767
00:40:53,611 --> 00:40:59,117
<i>Repeat, Crusader 50, rescue vehicle
coming alongside in three minutes,</i>

768
00:40:59,623 --> 00:41:01,938
<i>door-seals set to automatic.</i>

769
00:41:02,476 --> 00:41:06,945
<i>Prepare for boarding,
repeat, prepare for boarding.</i>

770
00:41:08,011 --> 00:41:09,015
The Hostess...

771
00:41:11,609 --> 00:41:13,060
what was her name?

772
00:41:23,694 --> 00:41:24,764
I don't know.

773
00:41:57,698 --> 00:41:58,943
<i>What d'you think it was?</i>

774
00:42:01,733 --> 00:42:02,728
No idea.

775
00:42:04,130 --> 00:42:05,631
D'you think it's still out there?

776
00:42:09,889 --> 00:42:11,516
Well, you'd better tell 'em.

777
00:42:12,116 --> 00:42:13,775
- This lot.
- Yeah.

778
00:42:14,144 --> 00:42:16,308
They can build a Leisure
Palace somewhere else.

779
00:42:17,074 --> 00:42:18,794
Let this planet keep on turning.

780
00:42:18,894 --> 00:42:20,915
Round an X-tonic star.

781
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:23,011
In silence.

782
00:42:25,038 --> 00:42:26,928
Can't imagine you, without a voice.

783
00:42:28,279 --> 00:42:29,575
Molto bene.

784
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:32,295
Molto bene!

785
00:42:32,677 --> 00:42:34,235
No, don't do that.

786
00:42:36,148 --> 00:42:36,945
Don't.

787
00:42:40,703 --> 00:42:41,579
Don't.

788
00:42:48,727 --> 00:42:50,867
Found a body, sir.
The Doctor is dead.

789
00:42:51,117 --> 00:42:53,551
<i>How could anything...
be worse than this?</i>

790
00:42:53,970 --> 00:42:55,791
What happened, what did they find?

791
00:42:55,891 --> 00:42:58,480
Oh, my God. The stars are going out.

792
00:42:58,580 --> 00:43:01,168
- Who are you?
- I was like you.

793
00:43:01,268 --> 00:43:04,440
- Turn around... show me your back.
- I've been pulled across

794
00:43:04,595 --> 00:43:07,418
from a different universe because
every single universe is in danger.

795
00:43:07,518 --> 00:43:09,853
There's something on your back.

796
00:43:10,203 --> 00:43:12,987
- What am I supposed to do?!
- Powering up...

797
00:43:13,795 --> 00:43:16,816
None of this... was meant to happen.
You're going to die.

798
