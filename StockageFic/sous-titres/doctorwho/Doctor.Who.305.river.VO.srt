00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:01,440
Martha, have you met my friend?

3
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:03,480
I have always wanted
to go to New York

4
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:05,480
November 1st 1930

5
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:10,520
- You only come to Hooverville when there's nowhere else to go.
- Men going missing?

6
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:11,880
Laszlo?

7
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:16,240
DALEK: The Empire State Building
must be completed in time!

8
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:18,680
Are you trying to kill
us? Don't argue with me!

9
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:21,960
This human is our best option.

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,360
NO!

11
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:26,480
The final experiment will begin.

12
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:30,600
The children of
Skaro must walk again.

13
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:32,720
What is it?

14
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:35,240
I... am...

15
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,760
a human Dalek.

16
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:16,960
These humans...

17
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,640
will become like me.

18
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,560
Prepare them for hybridisation.

19
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:29,360
Leave him alone! Don't you dare!

20
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:32,880
MUSIC PLAYS What is that sound?!

21
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:37,480
Ah, well, now, that would
be me. Hello. Surprise!

22
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:40,200
Boo! Et cetera. Doctor?

23
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:42,920
The enemy of the Daleks!

24
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,440
Exterminate! Wait!

25
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:49,160
Well, then, a new form of Dalek.

26
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,000
Fascinating.

27
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,760
And very clever.

28
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:56,600
The Cult of Skaro
escaped your slaughter.

29
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,960
How did you end up in 1930?

30
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,640
Emergency Temporal Shift. Oh, oh...

31
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:07,960
That must've roasted up
your power cells, yeah?

32
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,240
Time was, four Daleks
could've conquered the world!

33
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:19,040
But instead, you're skulking away,
hidden in the dark... experimenting.

34
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:21,800
All of which results... in you.

35
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,360
I am Dalek in human form!

36
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,880
But what does it feel like?

37
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:31,560
You can talk to me, Dalek Sec
- it is Dalek Sec, isn't it, that's your name?

38
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:35,680
You've got a name, a mind of your own
- tell me what you're thinking, right now.

39
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:38,080
I...

40
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:40,400
feel...

41
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:43,520
humanity. Good, that's good.

42
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:46,520
I feel...

43
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,040
everything we wanted from mankind,

44
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,760
which is...

45
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,400
ambition...

46
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:58,160
hatred, aggression.

47
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:00,520
And war!

48
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:03,040
Such a genius for war!

49
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:06,440
No. That's not what humanity
means. I think it does!

50
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:10,600
At heart, this species

51
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:13,120
is so very Dalek.

52
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:17,600
Right! So what have you achieved,
then, with this Final Experiment, eh?

53
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:23,840
Nothing! Cos I can show you what you're missing, with this thing
- a simple little radio.

54
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:26,160
What is the purpose of that device?

55
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:30,280
Well, exactly. It plays music!
What's the point of that?

56
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:33,120
Oh, with music,
you can dance to it,

57
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:35,280
sing with it,

58
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:37,960
fall in love to it.

59
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,480
Unless you're a Dalek, of
course. Then it's all just noise.

60
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:44,880
HIGH-PITCHED WAIL

61
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:47,900
run! Protect the Hybrid!

62
00:03:47,935 --> 00:03:50,880
Protect! Protect! Protect!

63
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,600
Report status.

64
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,600
Pain.

65
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:04,320
Pain of the flesh,

66
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:07,920
like no Dalek has felt
for thousands of years.

67
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:10,280
The Doctor has escaped!

68
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:12,600
Then find him! Find him!

69
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:17,000
Find the Doctor!

70
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,320
The prisoners must be recaptured.

71
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:24,960
C'mon, move! Move!
Move! Move! Move!

72
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,480
And you, Tallulah, run!

73
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:30,000
What's happened to Laszlo?!

74
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:47,120
C'mon, everyone,
up! Come on! Come on!

75
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:05,560
They have ascended.

76
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:09,040
Return to base! PIG SIAVES GRUNT

77
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:18,280
Request information. What
is your opinion of Dalek Sec?

78
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:21,160
We were created to follow him.

79
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:24,120
But you have... doubts?

80
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,360
Affirmative.

81
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:40,240
These... Daleks. They sound like the stuff
of nightmares. And they want to breed?

82
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:43,000
They're splicing themselves
on to Human bodies.

83
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:46,720
They've a farm of breeding stock
right here. You've got to get out.

84
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:49,840
Hooverville's the lowest place
to go! There's nowhere else.

85
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:52,320
I'm sorry, Solomon, but
you've got to scatter!

86
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:56,120
Get on to the railroads, travel
across state, just get out of New York.

87
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:00,320
You ain't seen 'em, boss.

88
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:04,040
Daleks are bad enough at any time,
but right now, they're vulnerable.

89
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,520
That makes them more
dangerous than ever.

90
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:09,360
GRUNTS

91
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:23,640
WHISTIE BIOWS They're
coming! They're coming!

92
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,480
A sentry must have seen something!

93
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:28,360
They're here! I've seen them
- monsters!

94
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,080
It's started. We're under attack!

95
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,920
Everyone to arms!

96
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:37,920
I'm ready, boss! But all
of you, find a weapon!

97
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:41,480
Use anything! Come back!
We've got to stick together!

98
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,480
It's not safe out there, come back!

99
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,160
No, no!

100
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:02,620
We need to get out of the park.
We can't. They're on all sides.

101
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:06,040
They're driving everyone here.
We're trapped! Stand together!

102
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,440
Gather round!
Everybody, come to me!

103
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:11,240
You there, Jethro, Harry,
Seamus, stay together!

104
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,840
They can't take all of us! GUNSHOTS

105
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:26,960
they're just the foot soldiers.

106
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,480
Oh, my God!

107
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:43,600
What in this world...? It's
the Devil. A Devil in the sky.

108
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:47,440
God save us all! It's damnation!
Oh, yeah?! We'll see about that!

109
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:49,360
That's not gonna work!

110
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,280
Establish visual contact.

111
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:56,720
Commence the attack.

112
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:58,880
There's more than one of them.

113
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:25,480
The humans will surrender!

114
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:28,000
Leave them alone, they've
done nothing to you!

115
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:30,720
We have located the Doctor.

116
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:35,080
No, Solomon, stay back!

117
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:38,480
I'm told that I'm addressing
the Daleks, is that right?

118
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:40,920
Observe humanity.

119
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:46,040
For all their faults,
they have such courage.

120
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,800
From what I hear,
you're outcasts too.

121
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:51,520
Solomon, don't. Doctor,
this is my township.

122
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:53,720
'You will respect my authority. '

123
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,880
Just let me try.

124
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:03,680
Daleks, ain't we the same?

125
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:06,160
'Underneath, ain't we all kin? '

126
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,720
Cos you see,

127
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:15,800
I've just discovered,
this past day,

128
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:20,920
that God's universe is a thousand
times the size I thought it was.

129
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:24,160
And that scares me
- oh, yeah,

130
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:28,040
terrifies me, right
down to the bone.

131
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:31,840
But surely, it's
got to give me hope -

132
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:38,040
hope that, maybe together,
we can make a better tomorrow.

133
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:42,440
So I beg you now.

134
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:46,460
If you have any
compassion in your hearts,

135
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:50,440
then you'll meet with
us and stop this fight.

136
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:55,600
Well?

137
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:58,160
What do you say?

138
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:00,680
Exterminate!

139
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:03,840
Oh, no!

140
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:06,080
HE GASPS

141
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:08,200
No! Solomon!

142
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:12,200
They killed him. They
just shot him on the spot.

143
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,560
Daleks...!

144
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:21,280
All right, so it's
my turn! Then kill me!

145
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:25,260
Kill me, if it'll stop
you attacking these people!

146
00:10:25,295 --> 00:10:29,200
I will be the destroyer
of our greatest enemy!

147
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:32,880
Then do it! Do it! Just do it!

148
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:34,160
DO IT!

149
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,840
Extermina...

150
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:38,280
Stop! I command you, stop!

151
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,280
I do not understand.

152
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,920
It is the Doctor!

153
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:45,440
But I want him alive.

154
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:49,600
The urge to kill is too strong.

155
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:51,400
I have decided.

156
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,460
The Doctor must live.

157
00:10:53,495 --> 00:10:55,480
And you will obey me!

158
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:59,640
I... obey.

159
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,200
What's going on?!

160
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:03,160
Bring him to me.

161
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,080
You will follow.

162
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,760
No!

163
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,320
You can't go.

164
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:14,920
I've got to go. The Daleks just changed
their minds. Daleks NEVER change their minds.

165
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:17,920
But what about us?

166
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:24,520
One condition!

167
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:30,560
If I come with you, you spare the
lives of everyone here, d'you hear me?

168
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,440
Obey the Doctor.

169
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:36,920
Humans will be spared.
Doctor... follow.

170
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:41,360
Then I'm coming with
you. Martha, stay here.

171
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:46,200
Do what you do best. People are
hurt, you can help them. Let me go.

172
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:53,160
Oh, and...

173
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,480
Can I just say...

174
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:57,760
thank you very much.

175
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:15,000
You saved the Doctor.

176
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,920
Why?

177
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:19,120
He's a genius.

178
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:21,280
And we can use him.

179
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:24,720
The future of the Daleks might
well depend upon the Doctor.

180
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:37,920
Here you go, I got
some more on the boil.

181
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,360
Thanks.

182
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:43,160
You'll be OK. It's just a cut.
Try and keep it clean. Thanks.

183
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:48,520
So what about us?
What do we do now?

184
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,800
The Doctor gave me this.

185
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:54,960
He must've had a
reason. What's that for?

186
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,160
It gets you into places,
buildings and things.

187
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:02,320
But where? He must want me to go
somewhere, but... what am I supposed to do?

188
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:12,360
Those people were defenceless! You only
wanted me, but that wasn't enough for you!

189
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:16,280
You had to start killing, cos
that's all a Dalek's good for!

190
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,400
The deaths were wrong.

191
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:20,440
I'm sorry?

192
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:24,120
That man,

193
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:28,000
their leader, Solomon,
he showed courage.

194
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:31,880
And that's... good?!
That's excellent.

195
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:36,640
Is it me, or are you just becoming
a little bit more... Human?

196
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:39,640
You are the last of your kind.

197
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:42,800
And now I am the first of mine.

198
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:45,880
But what do you want me for?

199
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:49,520
We tried everything to survive...

200
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:53,480
when we found ourselves
stranded in this ignorant age.

201
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:59,760
First, we tried growing new Dalek
embryos, but their flesh was too weak.

202
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:02,080
Yeah, I found one
of your experiments.

203
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:04,400
Just left to die,
out there in the dark.

204
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:06,040
It forced us to conclude -

205
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:11,280
what is the greatest resource
of this planet? Its people.

206
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:41,040
We stole them.

207
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:45,800
We stole human beings
for our purpose.

208
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:48,560
look inside.

209
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:01,960
This is the true extent
of the Final Experiment.

210
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,560
Is he dead?

211
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,120
Near death.

212
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:07,840
With his mind wiped,

213
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:10,920
ready to be filled with new ideas.

214
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,480
Dalek ideas.

215
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:15,360
The Human Dalek race.

216
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:19,080
All of these people
- how many?

217
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:24,780
We have caverns beyond this,
storing more than a thousand.

218
00:15:24,815 --> 00:15:28,960
Is there any way to restore
them? To make them Human again?

219
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:33,160
Everything that they
were has been lost.

220
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:37,320
So they're like shells. You've got empty
human beings, ready to be converted.

221
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,080
That's gonna take a lot of power.

222
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:44,280
This planet hasn't even split the atom yet! How
are you gonna do it? Open the conductor plan.

223
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:53,320
Wait a minute. Down in the sewers!

224
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:58,200
The Daleks mentioned this... energy
conductor. What does that mean?

225
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:04,720
I dunno. Maybe like a
lightning conductor or...

226
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:06,760
Dalekanium! Oh.

227
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,560
They said the
Dalekanium was in place.

228
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,600
In place where?! Frank might know.

229
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:21,200
Frank? Hmm? That Mr Diagoras,
he was some sort of fixer, yeah?

230
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:25,000
Get you jobs all over town? He
could find a profit anywhere.

231
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:27,640
But where, though,
what sort of things?

232
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,560
You name it.

233
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:35,000
We were all so desperate for work, you'd just
hope Diagoras would pick you for something good.

234
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:37,520
Building work
- that pays the best.

235
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:41,760
But what sort of building work?

236
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,960
Mainly building that.

237
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:51,960
Yeah, the Empire State Building. We're
underneath it. I worked that out already.

238
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,840
But you've hijacked
the whole building?

239
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:57,720
We needed an energy
conductor. What for?

240
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:01,240
I am the genetic template.

241
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:06,080
My altered DNA was to be
administered to each Human body.

242
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:08,800
A strong enough blast
of gamma radiation

243
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:12,360
can splice the Dalek
and Human genetic codes,

244
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:15,240
and waken each body from its sleep.

245
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,920
Gamma radiation?

246
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:20,840
Oh, the sun! You're using the sun.

247
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:26,240
Soon, the greatest solar flare for
a thousand years will hit the Earth.

248
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:30,480
Gamma radiation will be drawn to the
energy conductor, and when it strikes...

249
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:32,360
The army wakes.

250
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:35,400
I still don't know what you
need me for. Your genius.

251
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:40,040
Consider the pure Dalek.

252
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:43,640
Intelligent, but emotionless.

253
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:49,960
Removing the emotions makes you stronger. That's
what your creator thought, all those years ago.

254
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,520
He was wrong.

255
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:56,800
He was what? It makes us
lesser than our enemies.

256
00:17:56,840 --> 00:18:00,800
We must return to the
flesh and also the heart.

257
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:04,800
You wouldn't be the
supreme beings any more.

258
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:06,800
And that is good.

259
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:08,760
That is incorrect!

260
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:12,320
Daleks are supreme!
No! Not any more.

261
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:14,320
But that is our purpose!

262
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:16,280
Then our purpose is wrong!

263
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:19,160
Where has our quest
for supremacy led us?

264
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:23,800
To this
- hiding in the sewers. On a primitive world.

265
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:26,160
Just four of us left.

266
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:32,560
If we do not change now,
then we deserve extinction.

267
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:35,760
So you want to change everything
that makes a Dalek a Dalek.

268
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:38,400
Lf... you can help me.

269
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:41,520
'I always wanted to go
to the Empire State! '

270
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:45,600
Never imagined it quite like this,
though. Where are we headed, anyway?

271
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:49,680
The top, they're still building. How
come those guys just let us through?

272
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:52,320
How does that thing
work? Psychic paper.

273
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:54,920
Shows them whatever
I want them to think.

274
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:59,240
According to this, we're two
engineers and an architect.

275
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:02,800
Your knowledge of genetic
engineering is even greater than ours.

276
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:06,280
The new race must be ready by
the time the solar flare erupts.

277
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:11,600
But you're the template, I thought they were getting
a dose of you. I want to change the gene sequence.

278
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:16,440
To make them even more Human?
Humans are the great survivors.

279
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:19,440
We need that ability.
Hold on a minute, though.

280
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:22,440
This lot won't let you
do it! I am their leader.

281
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,960
Oh, and that's
enough for you, is it?

282
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,280
Daleks must follow orders.

283
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:31,480
Dalek Sec commands. We obey.

284
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:35,360
If you don't help me...
nothing will change.

285
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:39,000
There's no room on Earth
for another race of people.

286
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:41,680
You have your Tardis.

287
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:46,720
Take us across the
stars, find us a new home.

288
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:51,400
And allow the new
Daleks to start again.

289
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,960
When's that solar flare?

290
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,880
11 minutes.

291
00:19:56,440 --> 00:20:00,080
Right, then! Better get to work!

292
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:10,640
Look at this place!
Top of the world!

293
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:13,120
OK, now this looks good.

294
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:20,320
Hey, look at the date. These
designs were issued today.

295
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:24,440
They must have changed something
last minute. The Daleks?

296
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:28,360
Yeah, could be. The ones
underneath, they're from before.

297
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:33,640
Whatever they changed must be on this top
sheet, but not here. Check one against the other.

298
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:37,120
The height of this
place! This is amazing!

299
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:41,720
Careful! We're a hundred floors up,
don't wander off. I just wanna see.

300
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:52,800
New York City.

301
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:57,240
If aliens had to come to Earth...

302
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:00,120
Oh, no wonder they came here.

303
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:08,920
There's no point in chromosomal
grafting, it's too erratic.

304
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:13,240
Split the genome and force the new
Dalek-Human sequence right into the cortex.

305
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:16,040
We need more chromatin solution.

306
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:18,280
The Pig Slaves have it.

307
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:24,880
These Pig Slaves
- what happens to them in the grand plan? Nothing.

308
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:28,480
They're just simple beasts.
Their life span is limited.

309
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:30,880
None survive beyond a few weeks.

310
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:35,200
Power up the line feeds.

311
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:43,360
Laszlo... I can't undo
what they've done to you.

312
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:48,200
But they won't do it to
anyone else. Do you trust him?

313
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:54,360
I know that one man can
change the course of history.

314
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:58,920
The right idea, in the right place, at the right time
- that's all it takes.

315
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:01,600
I've got to believe it's possible.

316
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:11,600
I'll go and keep an eye out. Make sure we're
safe here, don't want nobody butting in.

317
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:14,720
There's hell of a storm moving
in. I wish the Doctor was here.

318
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:17,440
He'd know what we're looking for!

319
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:22,600
So tell me, where did
you and him first hook up?

320
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:25,640
It was in a hospital. Sort of.

321
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:28,040
Course
- him being a doctor.

322
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,400
Actually, I'm the doctor.

323
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:34,080
Well, kind of. You're a physician?

324
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:38,960
Really? I was training. Still
am, if I ever get back home.

325
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,360
You could be doctors together!

326
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:43,560
What a partnership!

327
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,720
It's such a shame.

328
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:49,880
If only he wasn't so...
different, d'you know what I mean?

329
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:52,560
Oh, you have no idea how
different he really is.

330
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:55,880
Yeah, he's a man, sweetheart
- that's different enough.

331
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:01,120
He had this...

332
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:04,720
companion, a while
back, this friend.

333
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:07,160
And ever since then,
he's been on his own.

334
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:11,240
But sometimes, I say something or
do something and he looks at me,

335
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:12,840
and I just sort of think...

336
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,720
...that he's not seeing me.

337
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:20,960
He's just remembering.

338
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:25,760
Oh, listen. Sweetheart,
you want to get all sad...

339
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:30,520
you want to have a contest
with me and Laszlo? No.

340
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:35,800
Listen, if the Doctor's with Laszlo now,
there's every chance that he could get him out.

341
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:37,760
And then what?

342
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:39,640
Don't talk crazy.

343
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:42,800
There's no future for me and him.

344
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:45,880
Those Dalek things took that away.

345
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:49,720
The one good thing I had in
my life, and they destroyed it.

346
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:56,160
The line feeds are ready.

347
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:59,600
Then it's all systems go!
The solar flare is imminent.

348
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:04,080
The radiation will reach Earth in a matter
of minutes. And we'll be ready for it.

349
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:08,520
That compound will allow the gene bonds
to reconfigure in a new pattern. Power up!

350
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,920
Start the line feeds.

351
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:20,800
There goes the gene
solution. The life blood.

352
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:43,600
Gotcha! Look!

353
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:49,520
There, on the mast, those
little lines, they're new!

354
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:51,520
They've added something, see?

355
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:53,440
Added what?

356
00:24:57,240 --> 00:25:00,120
BOTH: Dalekanium!

357
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:03,120
ALARM BLARES What's that?

358
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:06,480
What's happening? Is
there a malfunction?

359
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:11,040
Answer me! No, no,
no... The gene feed!

360
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:15,760
They can't disobey orders!

361
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:20,720
The Doctor will step
away from the controls.

362
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:23,480
Stop! You will not fire!

363
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:26,640
He is an enemy of the Daleks.

364
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:29,240
And so are you.

365
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:32,960
I am your commander.
I am Dalek Sec!

366
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,800
You have lost your authority.

367
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:38,560
You are no longer a Dalek.

368
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:44,120
What's going into the gene feed?
The new bodies will be 100% Dalek.

369
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:45,880
No! You can't do this.

370
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:49,920
Pig Slaves, restrain Dalek Sec!

371
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:52,120
And the Doctor!

372
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:58,240
Release me! I created
you! I am your master!

373
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:01,120
ALARM BLARES Solar
flare approaching!

374
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:02,880
Prepare to intercept!

375
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:05,760
There's the lift. After you.

376
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:13,160
The Doctor is escaping!
Stop him! Stop him!

377
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:17,400
We've only got minutes! We need
to get to the top of the building!

378
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:20,320
LASZLO PANTS Laszlo, what's wrong?

379
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:23,520
Out of breath. It's nothing.

380
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:26,960
We escaped them, Doctor,
that's all that matters.

381
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:34,440
You have betrayed me.

382
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:37,480
You told us to imagine.

383
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:40,680
And we imagined your irrelevance.

384
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:46,200
I was your leader! I
am Dalek Sec! Obey me!

385
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:47,840
LIFT RINGS

386
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:52,080
Doctor! First floor, perfumery!
I never thought I'd see you again!

387
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:54,520
No stopping me.

388
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:57,040
We've worked it out, we
know what they've done!

389
00:26:57,080 --> 00:27:01,840
There's Dalekanium on the mast... and it's
good to see you too, by the way. Oh, come here!

390
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:05,520
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!
See? Never waste time with a hug!

391
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:09,200
Deadlock seal. I can't stop it.
Where's it going? To the Daleks.

392
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:12,760
They won't leave us alone. What's
the time? 11.15. Six minutes!

393
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:18,000
I must remove the Dalekanium before the gamma
radiation hits. Gammon radiation? What's that?

394
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:26,440
Oh, that's high. That's
very... Blimey, that's high.

395
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:30,280
And we've got to go even higher.
That's the mast, up there, look.

396
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:33,480
We have to get the three pieces
of Dalekanium off the base!

397
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:36,600
That's not WE, that's just ME.
I'm not gonna just watch you!

398
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:41,440
No, you're gonna have your hands full anyway.
I'm sorry, Martha, but you've got to fight.

399
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:45,160
Confirm time until solar intercept.

400
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:48,640
Gamma strike, four
minutes and counting!

401
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:34,220
Pig Slaves will take the lift!

402
00:28:34,255 --> 00:28:37,200
Find the Doctor! Kill him!

403
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:47,280
The lift's coming up. I
should've brought that gun!

404
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:50,920
Tallulah, stay back. You too, Martha.
Pig Slaves are trained to kill!

405
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:53,720
I'm not going anywhere!
They're savages!

406
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:56,920
They're trained to slit your
throat with their bare teeth.

407
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:04,160
Laszlo?! What is it? Nah, it's
nothing, I'm fine, just leave me.

408
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:10,800
Oh, honey. You're burning up.
What's wrong with you? Tell me.

409
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:13,600
One man down, we
ain't even started yet.

410
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:18,160
It's not looking good, Frank.
No We're gonna get slaughtered!

411
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:26,360
Wait a minute. Lightning!

412
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:49,640
Oh, you'll be all right,
sweetheart. Don't you worry.

413
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:52,120
What the hell are
you two clowns doing?!

414
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:55,560
This place is gonna get hit.
A great big bolt of lightning!

415
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:58,960
Connect this to the lift and
they get zapped with electricity!

416
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,680
Oh, my God! That could
work! Then give us a hand!

417
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:08,680
Gamma strike imminent! In 40 Rels!

418
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:11,880
39... 38... 37...

419
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:19,720
NO!

420
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:30,520
Is that gonna work? It's got to! I got it
all piped up to the scaffolding outside.

421
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:33,840
Come here! Sit in the middle,
don't touch anything metal! OK.

422
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:38,320
Aa-a-a-agh!
I can't...

423
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:41,800
12... 11... 10...

424
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:59,040
Zero! Gamma strike!

425
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:02,800

Aa-a-a-gh!

426
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,880
The army awakes.

427
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:56,280
You did it, Martha! They
used to be like Laszlo.

428
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:58,400
They were people.

429
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:00,520
And I killed 'em.

430
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:01,960
No.

431
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:06,240
The Daleks killed them... long ago.

432
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:10,160
What about the Doctor?

433
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:20,360
You will identify.

434
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:23,720
I... am a Dalek.

435
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:28,360
Excellent! Begin the
invasion of Manhattan.

436
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:32,960
The population will be
converted into Daleks.

437
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:37,600
And from this island, we
will conquer the world!

438
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:40,480
Assume battle positions!

439
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:42,000
Take arms!

440
00:32:58,040 --> 00:32:59,800
Doctor?

441
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:01,560
Doctor...

442
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:06,320
look what we found. Halfway down.

443
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:10,280
You're getting careless.

444
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:12,160
Oh, my head...

445
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:16,040
Hi ya.

446
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:18,880
Hi. You survived, then.

447
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:21,200
So did you. Just about.

448
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:23,440
I can't help noticing...

449
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:26,200
There's Dalekanium still attached.

450
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:50,800
War demands strategy.

451
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:53,800
I am designated Controller!

452
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:57,720
That was to be my
position! You are unfit!

453
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:00,760
Connect me to the
military computer!

454
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:03,920
I will co-ordinate all units!

455
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:07,680
The Daleks will have gone straight
to a war footing, using the sewers.

456
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:12,400
Spreading soldiers out underneath Manhattan.
How do we stop them? There's only one chance.

457
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:15,960
I got in the way. That gamma strike
went zapping through me first.

458
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,480
But what does that mean?
We need to draw fire.

459
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:20,960
I need to face them.
Where can I draw them out?

460
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,960
Think, think, think!

461
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:27,160
I need a space, somewhere safe,
somewhere out of the way. Tallulah!

462
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:32,360
That's me
- three Ls and an H! The theatre's above them! Can you get us inside? Don't see why not.

463
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:37,080
Is there another lift? We came up in the
service elevator. That'll do! Allons-y!

464
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:40,600
Report status!

465
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:42,640
Maximum efficiency!

466
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:46,360
I am now ready for full-scale war!

467
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:49,520
Control over Dalek-Humans?

468
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:54,680
Connection confirmed! All
soldiers will take heed!

469
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:56,840
Weapons will be primed!

470
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:03,400
This should do it. Here we go!

471
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:07,480
There ain't nothing more creepy
than a theatre in the dark.

472
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:13,600
Listen, Doctor, I know you've got a thing for
show tunes, but there's a time and a place!

473
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:16,520
Laszlo? What's wrong?

474
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:19,200
Nothing...

475
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:23,400
It's just so hot! But
it's freezing in here!

476
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:27,160
Doctor, what's happening to
him? Not now, Tallulah, sorry.

477
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:31,400
What are you doing? If the Daleks are at
war, they'll want their number-one enemy.

478
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:33,360
I'm just telling them where I am.

479
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:40,320
Sonic device detected!
The Doctor survived?

480
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:43,080
Find him! And exterminate!

481
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:45,480
I'm telling you to
go. Frank can take you!

482
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:48,640
I'm telling you I'm not
going! Martha! That's an order!

483
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:52,360
Who are you, then? A
Dalek?! DOORS CRASH OPEN

484
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,280
Doctor. Oh, my God!

485
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:03,400
Well, I guess that's them, then,
huh? Humans. With Dalek DNA.

486
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:06,640
All right. Just stay calm.
Don't antagonise them.

487
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:08,600
But where are the Dalek masters?

488
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:11,040
Doctor located!

489
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:13,440
Advance! Advance!

490
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:42,320
The Doctor will stand
before the Daleks.

491
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:54,120
You will die, Doctor, at
the beginning of a new age!

492
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:58,000
Planet Earth will become New Skaro!

493
00:36:58,040 --> 00:37:00,160
Oh, and what a world.

494
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:03,920
With anything just the slightest
bit different ground into the dirt.

495
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:06,960
That's Dalek Sec!
Don't you remember?!

496
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:10,200
The cleverest Dalek ever!
Look what you've done to him!

497
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:13,640
Is that your new empire?

498
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:15,880
Mmm?

499
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:19,720
Is that the foundation for
a whole new civilisation?

500
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:21,200
My Daleks...

501
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:25,280
just understand this.

502
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:29,280
If you choose death
and destruction...

503
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:32,840
then death and destruction
will choose you.

504
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:36,920
Incorrect! We always survive.

505
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:41,320
Now we will destroy our greatest enemy
- the Doctor.

506
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:46,080
But he can help you.
The Doctor must die! No!

507
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:48,200
I beg you, don't.

508
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:49,720
Exterminate!

509
00:37:57,080 --> 00:38:00,720
Your own leader. The only
creature who might have

510
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:04,360
led you out of the darkness
and you destroyed him!

511
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:07,400
D'you see what they did, huh?

512
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:10,360
D'you see what a Dalek really is?

513
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:15,000
Warning! Dalek-Humans show
increased levels of serotonin!

514
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:18,760
If I'm gonna die, let's give the new
boys a shot, what d'you think, eh?

515
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:22,320
The Dalek Humans.
Their first blood!

516
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:25,040
Go on! Baptise them!

517
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:27,720
Dalek-Humans, take aim.

518
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:35,840
What are you waiting
for? Give the command!

519
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:37,760
EXTERMINATE!

520
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:41,800
Exterminate!

521
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:47,440
Obey! Dalek-Humans will obey!

522
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:50,160
They're not firing.
... What have you done?

523
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:52,120
You will obey!

524
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:54,000
EXTERMINATE!

525
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:57,840
Why? Daleks do not question orders!

526
00:38:57,880 --> 00:39:01,560
But why? You will stop this!

527
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:05,240
But why? You must not question!

528
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:11,040
But you are not our Master.
And we... We are not Daleks.

529
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:16,400
No, you're not. And
you never will be.

530
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:22,360
Sorry. I got in the way
of the lightening strike.

531
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:28,040
Time lord DNA got all mixed up.
Just that little bit of freedom.

532
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:33,920
If they will not obey,
then they must die.

533
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:35,720
Get down!

534
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:37,480
Exterminate!

535
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:43,520
Exterminate!

536
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:46,600
Destroy the Hybrids! Destroy!

537
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:49,440
Exterminate! Extermin...

538
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:01,580
It's all right. It's
all right. You did it.

539
00:40:01,615 --> 00:40:05,400
You're free. The
Dalek-Humans are failures!

540
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:07,400
Destruct! Destruct!

541
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:09,960
Destruct! HIGH-PITCHED WAIL

542
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,040
No! HYBRIDS SCREAM

543
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:22,440
No, they can't, they can't!
What happened? What was that?

544
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:27,000
They killed them. Rather
than let them live.

545
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:29,560
An entire species!

546
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:32,440
Genocide!

547
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:35,080
Only two of the Daleks
have been destroyed.

548
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:39,800
One of the Dalek Masters
must still be alive.

549
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:41,280
Oh, yes...

550
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:46,200
...in the whole universe.

551
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:51,200
Just one.

552
00:40:56,040 --> 00:41:00,080
Now what? You will be exterminated!

553
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:02,920
Yeah, yeah, think about
it, Dalek, what's your name?

554
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,720
Dalek Caan.

555
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:07,440
Dalek Caan.

556
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:12,760
Your entire species
has been wiped out.

557
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:17,480
And now the Cult of Skaro
has been eradicated...

558
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:21,280
...leaving only you.

559
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:28,600
Right now, you're facing the only man in the
universe who might show you some compassion.

560
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:33,720
Cos I've just seen one genocide.

561
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:38,160
I won't cause another.

562
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:42,000
Caan...

563
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:46,160
let me help you.

564
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:49,200
What do you say?

565
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:52,280
Emergency temporal shift!

566
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:57,520
Argh! Doctor!

567
00:41:57,560 --> 00:42:02,000
Doctor, he's sick. LASZLO PANTS

568
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:04,320
It's OK, you're all right.

569
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:13,360
His heart's racing like mad!
I've never seen anything like it.

570
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:15,320
What is it, Doctor?
What's the matter with him?

571
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:17,840
He says he can't
breathe! What is it?

572
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:20,120
It's time, sweetheart.

573
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:23,120
What do you mean, time?
What are you talking about?

574
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:26,080
None of the slaves
survive for long.

575
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:30,800
Most of them only lived for
a few weeks. I was lucky.

576
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:36,200
I held on, cos I
had you. But now...

577
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:40,480
...I'm dying, Tallulah.
No, you're not!

578
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:45,240
Not now, after all this!
Doctor, can't you do something?

579
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:52,200
Oh, Tallulah, with
three L's and an H...

580
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:55,320
just you watch me. What do I need?

581
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:59,120
Oh, how about a great
big genetic laboratory?

582
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:02,840
Oh, look! I've got one!
Laszlo, just you hold on!

583
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:06,320
There's been too many deaths today,
way too many people have died!

584
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:09,840
Brand-new creatures and wise
old men and age-old enemies!

585
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:12,520
And I'm telling you, I'm
telling you right now...

586
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:15,280
I am not having one more death!

587
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:18,000
Have you got that? Not one!

588
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:22,200
Tallulah, out of the
way! The Doctor is in!

589
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:31,880
Well, I talked to them. I told
them what Solomon would've said.

590
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:35,600
And I reckon I shamed one or
two of them. What did they say?

591
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:42,440
They'll give you a home, Laszlo.

592
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:47,000
I mean, er... don't imagine
people ain't gonna stare.

593
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:49,000
I can't promise you'll be at peace.

594
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:53,480
But in the end, that is
what Hooverville is for -

595
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:55,520
people who ain't got nowhere else.

596
00:43:55,560 --> 00:43:57,120
Thank you.

597
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:00,520
I... I can't thank you enough.

598
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:08,680
D'you reckon it's
gonna work? Those two?

599
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:10,240
I don't know.

600
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:13,320
Anywhere else in the universe,
I might worry about them.

601
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:15,840
But New York? That's
what this city's good at.

602
00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:18,840
Give me your tired, your
poor, your huddled masses...

603
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:21,800
and maybe the odd pig slave
Dalek mutant hybrid too.

604
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:24,160
SHE LAUGHS The pig
and the showgirl!

605
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:26,000
The pig and the showgirl!

606
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:30,720
Just proves it, I suppose.
There's someone for everyone.

607
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:32,320
Maybe.

608
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:39,520
Meant to say.

609
00:44:39,560 --> 00:44:42,200
I'm sorry. What for?

610
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:46,160
Just... cos that Dalek got away.
I know what that means to you. Mmm.

611
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:50,000
D'you think you'll ever
see it again? Oh, yes.

612
00:44:55,840 --> 00:44:57,360
One day.

613
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:07,200
Tonight, I'm going
to perform a miracle.

614
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:13,280
Something's wrong. I'm 76
years old and I am reborn!

615
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:16,560
This is a friend of mine. lovely
to meet you, Mrs Jones. Tish!

616
00:45:19,480 --> 00:45:22,520
You people are in serious
danger! Get out of here right now!

617
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:26,200
SCREAMING

618
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:30,040
No, get away from
her! ... just one more!

619
00:45:30,120 --> 00:45:35,480
