00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:21,500
HE COUGHS

2
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:23,180
Sorry.

3
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:26,660
ORGAN PLAYS OPENING BARS
OF THE WEDDING MARCH

4
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:03,020
SHE SCREAMS

5
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:04,500
PEOPLE GASP

6
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:12,100
MURMURING

7
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:14,540
WOMAN: Where did she go ?

8
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:19,140
What ?

9
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:23,060
What ? Who are you ? But. . .

10
00:01:23,108 --> 00:01:24,260
Where am I ?

11
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:26,985
What ? What the hell is this place ?

12
00:01:27,026 --> 00:01:28,460
What ?  !

13
00:02:05,784 --> 00:02:07,547
You can't do that, I wasn't. . .

14
00:02:07,589 --> 00:02:10,703
We're in flight. That is physically
impossible, how did. . .  ?

15
00:02:10,745 --> 00:02:14,821
Tell me where I am. I demand
you tell me, right now, where am I ?

16
00:02:14,865 --> 00:02:16,623
Inside the TARDIS.

17
00:02:16,665 --> 00:02:18,861
The what ? The TARDIS.
What ? The TARDIS.

18
00:02:18,905 --> 00:02:21,543
The what ? It's called the TARDIS.

19
00:02:21,586 --> 00:02:23,940
That's not a proper word.
You're just saying things.

20
00:02:23,988 --> 00:02:26,262
How did you get in here ?

21
00:02:26,308 --> 00:02:28,700
Well, obviously,
when you kidnapped me.

22
00:02:28,745 --> 00:02:31,303
Who was it ? Who's paying you ?
Was it Nerys ?

23
00:02:31,347 --> 00:02:34,381
Oh, my God,
she's finally got me back.

24
00:02:34,426 --> 00:02:38,820
This has got Nerys written all
over it. Who the hell is Nerys ?

25
00:02:38,866 --> 00:02:40,380
Your best friend !

26
00:02:40,428 --> 00:02:42,862
Wait a minute. What are you
dressed like that for ?

27
00:02:42,907 --> 00:02:46,300
I'm going ten-pin bowling. . .
Why do you think, dumbo !

28
00:02:46,347 --> 00:02:50,142
I was halfway up the aisle !
I've waited all my life for this.

29
00:02:50,186 --> 00:02:52,182
I was just seconds away,
and then you. . .

30
00:02:52,228 --> 00:02:54,020
I dunno, you drug me or something.

31
00:02:54,066 --> 00:02:56,500
I haven't done anything.
I'm having the police on you !

32
00:02:56,547 --> 00:02:59,021
Me and my husband,
as soon as he is my husband,

33
00:02:59,065 --> 00:03:02,183
we're gonna sue
the living backside off you !

34
00:03:04,868 --> 00:03:07,661
No, wait a minute,
wait a minute, don't. . .

35
00:03:15,906 --> 00:03:17,860
You're in space,

36
00:03:17,905 --> 00:03:19,943
outer space.

37
00:03:19,987 --> 00:03:24,061
This is my. . .spaceship.

38
00:03:24,105 --> 00:03:26,382
It's called the TARDIS.

39
00:03:26,425 --> 00:03:28,021
How am I breathing ?

40
00:03:28,068 --> 00:03:30,182
The TARDIS is protecting us.

41
00:03:32,146 --> 00:03:34,502
Who are you ?

42
00:03:34,547 --> 00:03:36,700
I'm The Doctor. You ?

43
00:03:38,266 --> 00:03:41,941
Donna. Human ?

44
00:03:41,987 --> 00:03:43,901
Yeah.

45
00:03:43,948 --> 00:03:45,662
Is that optional ?

46
00:03:45,708 --> 00:03:47,183
It is for me.

47
00:03:51,467 --> 00:03:55,022
You're an alien ? Yeah.

48
00:03:59,905 --> 00:04:02,021
It's freezing
with these doors open.

49
00:04:02,065 --> 00:04:06,021
I don't understand it,
and I understand everything !

50
00:04:06,068 --> 00:04:09,063
This can't happen.
There is no way a human being

51
00:04:09,107 --> 00:04:12,661
can lock itself onto the TARDIS
and transport itself inside.
It must be. . .

52
00:04:12,706 --> 00:04:17,182
It must be some sort of
subatomic connection,
something in the temporal field.

53
00:04:17,228 --> 00:04:20,903
Maybe something macrobinding your
DNA with the interior matrix. . .

54
00:04:20,948 --> 00:04:22,380
Maybe a genetic. . .

55
00:04:22,428 --> 00:04:27,102
What was that for ?
Get me to the church !

56
00:04:27,147 --> 00:04:29,340
Right ! Fine,
I don't want you here anyway !

57
00:04:29,385 --> 00:04:30,862
Where is this wedding ?

58
00:04:30,907 --> 00:04:30,941
St Mary's, Haven Road, Chiswick.
London, England.

59
00:04:30,987 --> 00:04:34,783
Earth. The Solar System.

60
00:04:38,785 --> 00:04:40,822
I knew it.

61
00:04:40,865 --> 00:04:44,223
Acting all innocent,
I'm not the first, am I ?

62
00:04:44,268 --> 00:04:46,822
How many women have you abducted ?

63
00:04:50,508 --> 00:04:54,420
That's my friend's. Where is she
then, popped out for a spacewalk ?

64
00:04:54,466 --> 00:04:56,140
She's gone.

65
00:04:56,185 --> 00:04:58,301
Gone where ?

66
00:05:00,108 --> 00:05:02,223
I lost her.

67
00:05:02,268 --> 00:05:03,742
Well, you can hurry up and lose me !

68
00:05:07,425 --> 00:05:10,021
How do you mean, "lost" ?

69
00:05:16,628 --> 00:05:20,460
Right ! Chiswick !

70
00:05:20,505 --> 00:05:23,623
No, she didn't run away.

71
00:05:23,665 --> 00:05:27,183
We're not talking jitters,
she literally vanished,

72
00:05:27,225 --> 00:05:29,020
now go and check the house.

73
00:05:29,067 --> 00:05:32,181
Oh, Angelica, that's not helping,
is it ? Now smarten up.

74
00:05:32,227 --> 00:05:33,461
Lance, any sign ?

75
00:05:33,506 --> 00:05:36,182
I've looked all round.
Where the hell did she go ?

76
00:05:36,225 --> 00:05:39,461
Showing off. First day at school,
she was sent home for biting.

77
00:05:39,505 --> 00:05:42,541
It's a bit more serious than that.
She's never disappeared before.

78
00:05:42,585 --> 00:05:44,623
She didn't disappear !

79
00:05:44,666 --> 00:05:47,982
It's a trick, it's one of her silly
little "look at me" party pieces.

80
00:05:48,027 --> 00:05:50,023
Oh, what if she's dead ?

81
00:05:50,067 --> 00:05:52,101
Oh, don't say that.

82
00:05:54,468 --> 00:05:56,500
I said St Mary's.

83
00:05:56,546 --> 00:05:59,580
What sort of Martian are you ?
Where's this ?

84
00:05:59,627 --> 00:06:03,700
Something's wrong with her.
The TARDIS, like she's. . .

85
00:06:03,747 --> 00:06:06,581
recalibrating !

86
00:06:06,627 --> 00:06:10,380
She's digesting.

87
00:06:10,428 --> 00:06:13,262
What is it ? What's wrong ?

88
00:06:13,308 --> 00:06:14,860
Donna,

89
00:06:14,905 --> 00:06:18,381
is there anything
that might have caused this ?

90
00:06:18,426 --> 00:06:21,301
Anything you might've done ?
Any sort of alien contact ?

91
00:06:21,347 --> 00:06:23,901
I can't let you go wandering off,
not if you're dangerous.

92
00:06:23,945 --> 00:06:25,823
Have you seen lights in the sky,

93
00:06:25,866 --> 00:06:29,940
or did you touch something, like,
something different,

94
00:06:29,988 --> 00:06:33,862
something strange, like something
made out of a funny sort of metal. . .

95
00:06:33,905 --> 00:06:37,021
Who are you getting married to ?
You sure he's human ?

96
00:06:37,065 --> 00:06:42,061
He's not a bit overweight with
a zip round his forehead, is he ?

97
00:06:42,105 --> 00:06:43,702
Donna !

98
00:06:43,746 --> 00:06:46,580
Donna ? Leave me alone.

99
00:06:46,625 --> 00:06:48,902
I just want to get married.
Come back to the TARDIS.

100
00:06:48,948 --> 00:06:52,300
No way, that box is too weird.

101
00:06:52,348 --> 00:06:55,942
It's bigger on the inside,
that's all. Oh, that's all !

102
00:06:57,428 --> 00:06:59,182
Ten past three, I'm gonna miss it.

103
00:06:59,225 --> 00:07:02,380
Can't you phone them, tell them
where you are ? How do I do that ?

104
00:07:02,426 --> 00:07:04,060
Haven't you got a mobile ?

105
00:07:04,106 --> 00:07:07,021
I'm in my wedding dress.
It doesn't have pockets.

106
00:07:07,066 --> 00:07:10,381
Who has pockets ? Have you ever seen
a bride with pockets ?

107
00:07:10,427 --> 00:07:14,062
When I went to my fitting,
the one thing I forgot to say
was, "Give me pockets !"

108
00:07:14,207 --> 00:07:17,343
This man you're marrying,
what's his name ?

109
00:07:17,386 --> 00:07:19,540
Lance. Good luck, Lance.

110
00:07:19,588 --> 00:07:25,300
Oi ! No stupid Martian
is gonna stop me from getting
married. To hell with you !

111
00:07:25,346 --> 00:07:27,663
I'm not. . . I'm not from Mars.

112
00:07:28,468 --> 00:07:34,263
Taxi ! He had his light on !
There's another one.

113
00:07:35,746 --> 00:07:37,101
Taxi !

114
00:07:37,147 --> 00:07:39,061
Oi !

115
00:07:40,986 --> 00:07:42,780
There's one.

116
00:07:47,865 --> 00:07:50,823
Oi !

117
00:07:50,866 --> 00:07:53,342
Why aren't they stopping ?

118
00:07:53,388 --> 00:07:55,100
They think I'm in fancy dress.

119
00:07:55,145 --> 00:07:56,703
Lay off the sauce, darlin' !

120
00:07:56,748 --> 00:08:00,780
They think I'm drunk.
BOTH: You're fooling no-one, mate !

121
00:08:00,826 --> 00:08:02,620
They think I'm in drag !

122
00:08:04,066 --> 00:08:06,141
Hold on, hold on.

123
00:08:06,186 --> 00:08:10,262
HE WHISTLES

124
00:08:10,308 --> 00:08:13,342
St Mary's, in Chiswick,
just off Haven Road.

125
00:08:13,388 --> 00:08:16,382
It's an emergency, I'm getting
married, just. . . Hurry up !

126
00:08:16,428 --> 00:08:19,100
That'll cost you, sweetheart,
double rates today.

127
00:08:19,148 --> 00:08:21,582
Oh, my God. Have you got any money ?

128
00:08:21,625 --> 00:08:24,703
Um. No. Haven't you ?

129
00:08:24,746 --> 00:08:27,342
Pockets !

130
00:08:27,386 --> 00:08:30,701
 .And that goes double
for your mother !

131
00:08:32,825 --> 00:08:35,861
I'll have him. I've got his number,
I'll have him.

132
00:08:35,905 --> 00:08:37,981
Talk about the Christmas spirit.

133
00:08:38,028 --> 00:08:39,540
Is it Christmas ?

134
00:08:39,586 --> 00:08:44,102
Well, duh ! Maybe not on Mars,
but here it's Christmas Eve.

135
00:08:44,148 --> 00:08:45,980
Phone box !

136
00:08:46,027 --> 00:08:50,822
We can reverse the charges.
How come you're getting married
on Christmas Eve ?

137
00:08:50,868 --> 00:08:52,580
Can't bear it, I hate Christmas.

138
00:08:52,628 --> 00:08:55,023
Honeymoon, Morocco,
sunshine, lovely.

139
00:08:57,305 --> 00:09:00,861
What's the operator ?
I've not done this in years.
What do you dial, 100 ?

140
00:09:00,907 --> 00:09:02,942
Just call direct. What did you do ?

141
00:09:02,988 --> 00:09:06,421
Something. . .Martian.
Now phone ! I'll get money.

142
00:09:18,465 --> 00:09:20,461
Oh, answer the phone !

143
00:09:22,187 --> 00:09:25,340
Hello ? Oh, now the battery's gone
dead, has anyone got a charger ?

144
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:27,825
Could you try the hotel ?

145
00:09:27,866 --> 00:09:30,620
Hello ? Hello ?

146
00:09:30,664 --> 00:09:34,387
Vikram, is your phone working ?
I've got one wedding about to arrive

147
00:09:34,429 --> 00:09:37,783
and another wedding refusing
to leave, so it IS a police matter.

148
00:09:37,825 --> 00:09:39,743
Mum, get off the phone and listen !

149
00:09:39,787 --> 00:09:44,263
I'm in. . . Oh, my God,
I don't know where I am.

150
00:09:44,307 --> 00:09:47,581
It's a street. . .
and there's a WH Smith.

151
00:09:47,628 --> 00:09:49,343
But it's definitely Earth !

152
00:09:49,385 --> 00:09:52,583
MACHINE BEEPS

153
00:10:02,828 --> 00:10:06,663
Excuse me. I'm begging you,
I'm getting married, and I'm late,

154
00:10:06,706 --> 00:10:11,181
and I just need to borrow a tenner,
and I'll pay you back, I promise.

155
00:10:12,186 --> 00:10:18,023
THEY PLAY: "God Rest Ye
Merry Gentlemen"

156
00:10:18,065 --> 00:10:20,100
Taxi !

157
00:10:20,146 --> 00:10:21,662
St Mary's, Chiswick.

158
00:10:22,708 --> 00:10:27,622
Thanks for nothing, spaceman !
I'll see you in court !

159
00:10:30,786 --> 00:10:32,340
Donna !

160
00:10:54,426 --> 00:10:57,060
I'll give you the rest
when we get there.

161
00:10:57,106 --> 00:10:58,303
Oh, I look a mess.

162
00:10:58,347 --> 00:11:00,743
Hurry up !

163
00:11:06,028 --> 00:11:07,780
Hold on a minute, I said Chiswick !

164
00:11:07,825 --> 00:11:11,463
You've missed the turning.
Excuse me ?

165
00:11:11,505 --> 00:11:13,620
We should've turned off, back there.

166
00:11:13,665 --> 00:11:16,981
We're going the wrong way !

167
00:11:29,827 --> 00:11:31,583
What the hell are you doing ?

168
00:11:31,626 --> 00:11:33,420
I'm late for the wedding.

169
00:11:33,466 --> 00:11:36,422
My own wedding, do you get that ?

170
00:11:36,467 --> 00:11:39,423
METALLIC THRUMMING

171
00:11:42,306 --> 00:11:47,420
Turn around ! Turn this cab around
right now !

172
00:11:47,467 --> 00:11:49,861
Are you deaf or what ?

173
00:11:52,586 --> 00:11:54,262
Oh, my God.

174
00:11:57,187 --> 00:11:58,501
Help me !

175
00:11:59,546 --> 00:12:01,460
Help me !

176
00:12:03,427 --> 00:12:05,741
Help me ! Help me !

177
00:12:05,785 --> 00:12:07,380
Help me !

178
00:12:07,428 --> 00:12:10,663
Help me ! Help me !

179
00:12:10,706 --> 00:12:12,702
Help me ! Get me out !

180
00:12:12,747 --> 00:12:14,621
Help me !

181
00:12:14,666 --> 00:12:17,781
Help me, I'm being driven
by a robot !

182
00:12:20,146 --> 00:12:22,501
Behave !

183
00:12:32,027 --> 00:12:34,620
You are kidding me.

184
00:12:54,628 --> 00:12:56,860
Open the door !

185
00:12:56,907 --> 00:12:58,381
Do what ?

186
00:12:58,427 --> 00:12:59,741
Open the door !

187
00:12:59,788 --> 00:13:02,662
I can't ! It's locked !

188
00:13:08,065 --> 00:13:10,581
Santa's a robot !

189
00:13:10,627 --> 00:13:12,780
Donna, open the door.

190
00:13:12,826 --> 00:13:15,302
What for ?  ! You've got to jump !

191
00:13:15,345 --> 00:13:19,661
Am I blinking flip jumping !
I'm supposed to be getting married !

192
00:13:58,987 --> 00:14:01,701
Listen to me, you've got to jump !

193
00:14:01,748 --> 00:14:05,101
I'm not jumping on a motorway !

194
00:14:05,148 --> 00:14:07,142
Whatever that thing is,
it needs you.

195
00:14:07,188 --> 00:14:09,380
And whatever it needs you for,
it's not good !

196
00:14:09,426 --> 00:14:11,260
Now come on !

197
00:14:11,307 --> 00:14:14,942
I'm in my wedding dress !
Yes, you look lovely. Come on !

198
00:14:27,587 --> 00:14:29,820
I can't do it !

199
00:14:29,866 --> 00:14:31,141
Trust me.

200
00:14:31,186 --> 00:14:33,342
Is that what you said to her ?

201
00:14:33,385 --> 00:14:36,740
Your friend. The one you lost.

202
00:14:36,787 --> 00:14:38,500
Did she trust you ?

203
00:14:38,547 --> 00:14:44,221
Yes, she did. And she is not dead.
She is so alive. Now jump !

204
00:14:47,267 --> 00:14:49,303
SHE SCREAMS

205
00:15:04,747 --> 00:15:08,540
THE DOCTOR COUGHS

206
00:15:12,425 --> 00:15:17,822
Funny thing is, for a spaceship,
she doesn't do that much flying.

207
00:15:17,867 --> 00:15:22,143
We'd better give her a couple
of hours. You all right ?

208
00:15:22,185 --> 00:15:23,903
Doesn't matter.

209
00:15:23,945 --> 00:15:26,500
Did we miss it ?

210
00:15:26,546 --> 00:15:29,100
Yeah.

211
00:15:29,145 --> 00:15:30,903
Well, you can book another date.

212
00:15:30,948 --> 00:15:32,822
Course we can.

213
00:15:32,867 --> 00:15:34,543
You've still got the honeymoon.

214
00:15:34,585 --> 00:15:37,502
It's just a holiday, now.

215
00:15:37,546 --> 00:15:40,540
Yeah. Yeah.

216
00:15:40,587 --> 00:15:42,063
Sorry.

217
00:15:42,106 --> 00:15:44,342
It's not your fault. Oh.

218
00:15:44,387 --> 00:15:46,141
That's a change.

219
00:15:49,147 --> 00:15:51,142
Wish you had a time machine.

220
00:15:51,187 --> 00:15:54,063
Then we could go back
and get it right.

221
00:15:54,108 --> 00:15:55,540
Um, yeah, yeah.

222
00:15:57,747 --> 00:16:02,703
But. . .even if I did, I couldn't go
back on someone's personal timeline.

223
00:16:02,747 --> 00:16:04,221
Apparently.

224
00:16:19,746 --> 00:16:22,100
God, you're skinny.
This wouldn't fit a rat.

225
00:16:23,628 --> 00:16:26,140
Oh, and you'd better put this on.

226
00:16:26,188 --> 00:16:29,820
Oh, d'you have to rub it in ?
Those creatures can trace you.

227
00:16:29,865 --> 00:16:33,340
This is a biodamper,
should keep you hidden.

228
00:16:33,387 --> 00:16:36,503
With this ring. . .I thee biodamp.

229
00:16:36,546 --> 00:16:38,743
For better or for worse.

230
00:16:43,465 --> 00:16:47,381
So come on, then - robot Santas,
what are they for ?

231
00:16:47,425 --> 00:16:51,900
Your basic roboscavenger.
The Father Christmas stuff
is just a disguise.

232
00:16:51,946 --> 00:16:53,661
I met them last Christmas.

233
00:16:53,705 --> 00:16:55,182
Why, what happened then ?

234
00:16:56,707 --> 00:16:58,382
Great big spaceship,

235
00:16:58,428 --> 00:17:01,661
hovering over London ?
You didn't notice ?

236
00:17:01,705 --> 00:17:03,260
I had a bit of a hangover.

237
00:17:05,666 --> 00:17:09,020
I spent Christmas Day over there,
the Powell Estate, with this. . .

238
00:17:10,507 --> 00:17:11,703
 .family.

239
00:17:11,746 --> 00:17:14,142
My friend, she had this family.
Well, they. . .

240
00:17:19,106 --> 00:17:20,860
Still.

241
00:17:20,907 --> 00:17:22,942
Gone now.

242
00:17:24,468 --> 00:17:27,861
Your friend. Who was she ?

243
00:17:27,906 --> 00:17:32,581
The question is, what do camouflage
robot mercenaries want with you ?

244
00:17:32,625 --> 00:17:35,301
And how did you get inside
the TARDIS ? I dunno. . .

245
00:17:36,747 --> 00:17:38,780
What's your job ?

246
00:17:38,827 --> 00:17:42,381
I'm a secretary.

247
00:17:42,425 --> 00:17:45,302
Weird. I mean, you're not special,
you're not powerful,

248
00:17:45,345 --> 00:17:48,101
you're not clever,
you're not important. . .

249
00:17:48,145 --> 00:17:53,541
This friend of yours, just before
she left, did she punch you
in the face ? Stop bleeping me !

250
00:17:56,825 --> 00:17:58,542
What kind of secretary ?

251
00:17:58,588 --> 00:18:00,461
I'm at HC Clements.

252
00:18:00,506 --> 00:18:03,140
That's where I met Lance.
I was temping. . .

253
00:18:03,186 --> 00:18:06,143
I mean, it was all
a bit posh, really.

254
00:18:06,186 --> 00:18:08,781
I'd spent the last two years
at a double glazing firm.

255
00:18:08,825 --> 00:18:11,423
Well, I thought, I'm never
going to fit in here.

256
00:18:11,467 --> 00:18:13,061
And then he made me a cup of coffee.

257
00:18:13,105 --> 00:18:14,623
I mean, that just doesn't happen.

258
00:18:14,666 --> 00:18:18,180
Nobody gets the secretaries
a coffee.

259
00:18:18,225 --> 00:18:22,583
And Lance, he's the Head of HR,
he didn't need to bother with me.

260
00:18:22,625 --> 00:18:25,181
But he was nice, he was funny.

261
00:18:25,226 --> 00:18:29,822
And it turns out he thought everyone
else was really snotty too.

262
00:18:29,866 --> 00:18:32,422
So, that's how it started,
me and him.

263
00:18:32,466 --> 00:18:35,620
One cup of coffee and that was it.
When was this ?

264
00:18:35,705 --> 00:18:37,780
Six months ago.

265
00:18:37,828 --> 00:18:39,820
Bit quick, to get married.

266
00:18:39,865 --> 00:18:42,181
Well. . .he insisted.

267
00:18:42,228 --> 00:18:43,702
Will you marry me ?

268
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:48,981
And he nagged and he nagged me.

269
00:18:49,028 --> 00:18:50,500
Oh, just think about it.

270
00:18:50,547 --> 00:18:52,222
We'd make a great couple,

271
00:18:52,266 --> 00:18:55,862
and I'd get rid of the dog, and
we could do out that back bedroom.

272
00:18:55,908 --> 00:18:59,860
And he just wore me down. And
then finally I just gave in.

273
00:18:59,907 --> 00:19:00,901
Please.

274
00:19:00,948 --> 00:19:02,222
Oh, please.

275
00:19:02,265 --> 00:19:05,741
Please, please, please, please,
please, please.

276
00:19:05,785 --> 00:19:07,743
What does HC Clements do ?

277
00:19:07,786 --> 00:19:11,783
Oh, security systems. Y'know, entry
codes, ID cards, that sort of thing.

278
00:19:11,828 --> 00:19:14,582
Ask me, it's a posh name
for a locksmith's.

279
00:19:14,626 --> 00:19:16,380
Keys. . .

280
00:19:16,427 --> 00:19:20,581
Anyway, enough of my CV. Come on,
it's time to face the consequences.

281
00:19:20,627 --> 00:19:24,383
Oh, this is gonna be so shaming.

282
00:19:24,427 --> 00:19:27,663
You can do the explaining,
Martian Boy.

283
00:19:27,707 --> 00:19:31,301
Yeah, I'm not from Mars.

284
00:19:33,668 --> 00:19:37,541
Oh, I had this great big
reception all planned.

285
00:19:37,587 --> 00:19:39,863
Everyone's going to be heartbroken. .

286
00:19:39,906 --> 00:19:43,062
MUSIC: "Merry Xmas Everybody"
by Slade

287
00:20:10,148 --> 00:20:12,662
MUSIC STOPS

288
00:20:12,706 --> 00:20:15,942
You had the reception without me ?

289
00:20:15,988 --> 00:20:18,942
Donna, what happened to you ?

290
00:20:18,987 --> 00:20:24,063
You had the reception without me ?

291
00:20:24,108 --> 00:20:26,022
Hello, I'm The Doctor.

292
00:20:26,068 --> 00:20:30,103
They had the reception without me !
Yes, I gathered.

293
00:20:30,145 --> 00:20:34,021
Well, it was all paid for, why not ?
Thank you, Nerys.

294
00:20:34,067 --> 00:20:36,340
Well, what were we supposed to do ?

295
00:20:36,385 --> 00:20:38,783
I got your silly
little message in the end.

296
00:20:38,827 --> 00:20:43,580
"I'm on Earth" ?  ! Very funny.
But what the hell happened ?

297
00:20:43,627 --> 00:20:46,141
You vanished ! How did you do it ?

298
00:20:46,188 --> 00:20:48,503
What's the trick, cos I know
it's an illusion. . .

299

Awwww !

00:20:58,825 --> 00:21:02,183
APPLAUSE

303
00:21:19,626 --> 00:21:22,861
# I have wandered, I have rambled

304
00:21:22,905 --> 00:21:26,223
# I have crossed the stratosphere

305
00:21:26,268 --> 00:21:29,220
# I have seen a mess of problems

306
00:21:29,265 --> 00:21:32,541
# That I long to disappear

307

# Now all I have's
this anguished heart

308

# For you have vanished too

309
00:21:39,265 --> 00:21:43,821
# Oh, my girl
My girl, my precious girl

310
00:21:43,868 --> 00:21:45,741
# Just what is this man to do ?

311
00:21:45,786 --> 00:21:51,543
# So reel me in, my precious girl
Come on, take me home

312
00:21:51,585 --> 00:21:54,861
# Cos my body's tired of travelling

313
00:21:54,905 --> 00:21:58,383
# And my heart don't wish to roam

314
00:21:58,426 --> 00:22:04,420
# Yeah, reel me in, my precious girl
Come on, take me home

315
00:22:04,467 --> 00:22:07,143
# Cos my body's tired of travelling

316
00:22:07,188 --> 00:22:10,423
# And my heart don't wish to roam

317
00:22:10,467 --> 00:22:11,622
# No, no

318
00:22:16,025 --> 00:22:17,942
# Well, you took me in

319
00:22:17,985 --> 00:22:21,983
# You stole my heart
I cannot roam no more

320
00:22:22,025 --> 00:22:28,183
# Cos love, it stays within you
It doesn't wash up on a shore

321
00:22:28,228 --> 00:22:32,103
# And a fighting man
forgets each cut

322
00:22:32,146 --> 00:22:35,940
# Each knock, each bruise, each fall

323
00:22:35,985 --> 00:22:38,581
# But a fighting man
cannot forget. . . #

324
00:22:38,625 --> 00:22:40,941
Oh, I taped the whole thing.

325
00:22:40,985 --> 00:22:44,021
They've all had a look. They said
sell it to You've Been Framed.

326
00:22:44,067 --> 00:22:46,143
I said, more like the news !

327
00:22:46,187 --> 00:22:47,861
Here we are.

328
00:22:50,346 --> 00:22:53,181
It can't be. . . Play it again.

329
00:22:53,426 --> 00:22:55,782
Clever, mind.
Good trick, I'll give her that.

330
00:22:55,828 --> 00:22:57,300
I was clapping.

331
00:22:59,507 --> 00:23:01,300
But that looks like. . .

332
00:23:01,347 --> 00:23:03,180
Huon particles.

333
00:23:03,225 --> 00:23:06,303
What's that, then ?
That's impossible.

334
00:23:06,348 --> 00:23:08,860
That's. . .ancient. Huon energy
doesn't exist any more,

335
00:23:08,908 --> 00:23:10,982
not for billions of years.

336
00:23:11,025 --> 00:23:12,501
It's so old that. . .

337
00:23:16,626 --> 00:23:20,380
It can't be hidden by a biodamper !

338
00:23:33,148 --> 00:23:34,901
Donna !

339
00:23:34,947 --> 00:23:37,582
Donna ! They've found you !
You said I was safe !

340
00:23:37,628 --> 00:23:39,463
We've got to get everyone out.

341
00:23:39,507 --> 00:23:41,260
My God, it's all my family.

342
00:23:41,306 --> 00:23:43,622
Out the back door !

343
00:23:46,787 --> 00:23:48,983
Maybe not !

344
00:23:56,785 --> 00:23:58,582
We're trapped !

345
00:24:04,468 --> 00:24:07,142
Christmas trees. What about them ?

346
00:24:07,187 --> 00:24:09,181
They kill. Get away from the trees !

347
00:24:09,225 --> 00:24:12,782
Get away from the Christmas trees !
Everyone get away from the trees !

348
00:24:15,908 --> 00:24:21,902
Lance. . .  ! Turn the music off. Listen
to me - stay away from the trees.

349
00:24:21,948 --> 00:24:24,902
Stay away from the trees ! Oh,
for God's sake, the man's an idiot.

350
00:24:24,948 --> 00:24:28,902
What harm is a Christmas tree
gonna. . .  ? Oh.

351
00:24:36,986 --> 00:24:39,500
INDISTINCT CHATTER

352
00:24:47,706 --> 00:24:49,100
SCREAMING

353
00:25:24,705 --> 00:25:26,103
Oi !

354
00:25:26,148 --> 00:25:28,582
Santa ! Word of advice.

355
00:25:28,628 --> 00:25:32,702
If you're attacking a man
with a sonic screwdriver. . .

356
00:25:32,748 --> 00:25:35,742
don't let him near
the sound system.

357
00:25:35,788 --> 00:25:36,943
FEEDBACK SQUEALS

358
00:25:56,866 --> 00:26:00,141
It's all right, Stan,
you'll be all right.

359
00:26:00,186 --> 00:26:02,503
Michael ? Connie ?

360
00:26:04,386 --> 00:26:06,822
Oh, Sunita, do something useful.

361
00:26:06,867 --> 00:26:10,183
What is it ? What were they ?
Just stop wittering, just help 'em !

362
00:26:10,227 --> 00:26:14,941
Remote control for the decorations,
but there's a second
remote control for the robots.

363
00:26:14,988 --> 00:26:19,182
They're not scavengers any more.
Someone's taken possession.

364
00:26:19,228 --> 00:26:21,220
You're a doctor.
People have been hurt.

365
00:26:21,266 --> 00:26:24,502
Nah, they wanted you alive, look.
They're not active now.

366
00:26:24,546 --> 00:26:27,181
All the same, you could help.

367
00:26:27,226 --> 00:26:31,822
You've got to think of the bigger
picture. There's still a signal !

368
00:26:31,867 --> 00:26:33,863
Donna, who is he ?

369
00:26:33,905 --> 00:26:35,542
Who is that man ?

370
00:26:45,588 --> 00:26:48,621
There's someone behind this,
directing the roboforms.

371
00:26:48,666 --> 00:26:50,423
But why is it me ? What have I done ?

372
00:26:50,468 --> 00:26:53,581
Find the controller,
and we'll find that out. Ooh.

373
00:26:53,627 --> 00:26:55,140
It's up there.

374
00:26:56,826 --> 00:26:58,383
Something in the sky.

375
00:26:59,986 --> 00:27:03,502
Clever, clever, clever boy.

376
00:27:03,545 --> 00:27:05,421
CHUCKLES

377
00:27:05,467 --> 00:27:08,901
Eat you up all snicker-snacker,

378
00:27:08,945 --> 00:27:10,623
little travelling man. . .

379
00:27:12,186 --> 00:27:16,540
He shall come to me,
and the beautiful bride.

380
00:27:16,585 --> 00:27:21,580
Such secrets to unlock.

381
00:27:21,625 --> 00:27:24,501
I shall descend this night.

382
00:27:24,548 --> 00:27:28,303
I shall descend upon this Earth

383
00:27:28,345 --> 00:27:31,782
and shine !

384
00:27:34,106 --> 00:27:36,380
I've lost the signal ! We've got to
get to your office.

385
00:27:36,428 --> 00:27:39,822
I think that's where it all started.
Lance ! Is it Lance ?

386
00:27:39,868 --> 00:27:41,500
Lance, can you give me a lift ?

387
00:27:41,545 --> 00:27:45,581
To you lot this might just be
a locksmith's, but HC Clements

388
00:27:45,628 --> 00:27:49,820
was bought up 23 years ago by the
Torchwood Institute. Who are they ?

389
00:27:49,868 --> 00:27:52,782
They were behind
the Battle of Canary Wharf.

390
00:27:52,826 --> 00:27:55,860
Cyberman invasion.

391
00:27:55,907 --> 00:27:59,141
Skies over London full of Daleks ?
I was in Spain.

392
00:27:59,187 --> 00:28:01,221
They had Cybermen in Spain.

393
00:28:01,265 --> 00:28:04,621
Scuba-diving. That big picture,
you keep on missing it.

394
00:28:04,665 --> 00:28:07,660
Torchwood was destroyed,
but HC Clements stayed in business.

395
00:28:07,706 --> 00:28:10,340
I think someone else came in
and took over the operation.

396
00:28:10,388 --> 00:28:12,343
But what do they want with me ?

397
00:28:12,388 --> 00:28:16,063
Somehow, you've been dosed
with Huon energy.

398
00:28:16,108 --> 00:28:17,380
And that's a problem,

399
00:28:17,425 --> 00:28:20,181
because Huon energy hasn't existed
since the dark times.

400
00:28:20,226 --> 00:28:24,141
The only place you'd find
a Huon particle now is a remnant
in the heart of the TARDIS.

401
00:28:24,187 --> 00:28:27,381
Y'see, that's what happened.

402
00:28:27,428 --> 00:28:31,262
Say that's the TARDIS,
and that's you.

403
00:28:31,308 --> 00:28:35,022
The particles inside you activated,
the particles magnetised and whap !

404
00:28:35,065 --> 00:28:37,821
You were pulled inside the TARDIS.

405
00:28:37,867 --> 00:28:41,061
I'm a pencil inside a mug.
Yes, you are. 4H. Sums you up.

406
00:28:41,105 --> 00:28:43,263
Lance, what was HC Clements
working on ?

407
00:28:43,306 --> 00:28:46,300
Anything top secret, special
operations, do not enter ?

408
00:28:46,346 --> 00:28:49,502
I'm in charge of personnel,
I wasn't project manager. . .

409
00:28:49,548 --> 00:28:51,940
Why am I even explaining myself ?

410
00:28:51,987 --> 00:28:56,222
You make keys, that's the point -
and look at this !

411
00:28:56,268 --> 00:28:58,262
We're on the third floor.

412
00:28:58,305 --> 00:29:01,942
Underneath reception,
there's a basement, yes ?

413
00:29:01,988 --> 00:29:04,980
How come on the lift there's
a button marked lower basement ?

414
00:29:05,025 --> 00:29:08,061
There's a whole floor which doesn't
exist on the official plans.

415
00:29:08,107 --> 00:29:12,260
What's down there ?
Are you telling me this building's
got a secret floor ?

416
00:29:12,305 --> 00:29:15,940
No, I'm showing you this building's
got a secret floor. It needs a key.

417
00:29:15,985 --> 00:29:17,943
I don't.

418
00:29:17,988 --> 00:29:20,700
Right, thanks, you two,
I can handle this. See you later.

419
00:29:20,748 --> 00:29:23,222
No chance. You're the man
who keeps saving my life.

420
00:29:23,265 --> 00:29:25,063
I ain't letting you out of my sight.

421
00:29:25,107 --> 00:29:27,023
Going down ! Lance !

422
00:29:27,065 --> 00:29:29,821
Maybe I should go
to the police. . . Inside !

423
00:29:33,347 --> 00:29:36,781
To honour and obey.
Tell me about it, mate. Oi !

424
00:29:42,186 --> 00:29:45,261
The bride approaches.

425
00:29:45,308 --> 00:29:47,583
She is my key.

426
00:29:52,788 --> 00:29:54,621
Where are we ?

427
00:29:54,667 --> 00:29:57,703
What goes on down here ?
Let's find out.

428
00:29:57,747 --> 00:30:00,380
D'you think Mr Clements
knows about this place ?

429
00:30:00,425 --> 00:30:03,661
The mysterious HC Clements.
Oh, I think he's part of it.

430
00:30:03,706 --> 00:30:06,860
Oh, look. Transport !

431
00:30:15,025 --> 00:30:17,061
SHE LAUGHS

432
00:30:38,386 --> 00:30:42,782
Wait here, I just need to get
my bearings. Don't do anything.

433
00:30:42,825 --> 00:30:44,463
You'd better come back.

434
00:30:44,505 --> 00:30:46,782
Couldn't get rid of you if I tried.

435
00:30:56,065 --> 00:31:00,580
Donna, have you thought about this,
properly ?

436
00:31:00,627 --> 00:31:03,941
I mean, this is serious !

437
00:31:03,988 --> 00:31:06,502
What the hell are we gonna do ?

438
00:31:06,548 --> 00:31:08,303
Oh, I thought July.

439
00:31:41,548 --> 00:31:44,180
Thames Flood Barrier !
Right on top of us.

440
00:31:44,227 --> 00:31:46,743
Torchwood snuck in
and built this place underneath.

441
00:31:46,786 --> 00:31:50,863
What, there's, like,
a secret base hidden underneath
a major London landmark ?

442
00:31:50,907 --> 00:31:53,301
I know. Unheard of.

443
00:31:56,508 --> 00:31:59,822
Oooh, look at this.

444
00:32:00,345 --> 00:32:02,261
Stunning !

445
00:32:02,308 --> 00:32:04,183
What does it do ?

446
00:32:04,228 --> 00:32:06,623
Particle extrusion. Hold on. . .

447
00:32:09,745 --> 00:32:11,263
Brilliant !

448
00:32:11,307 --> 00:32:14,140
They've been manufacturing
Huon particles.

449
00:32:14,186 --> 00:32:17,461
My people got rid of Huons, they
unravelled the atomic structure.

450
00:32:17,505 --> 00:32:19,582
Your people ?

451
00:32:19,625 --> 00:32:22,541
Who are they ?
What company d'you represent ?

452
00:32:22,587 --> 00:32:24,221
Oh, I'm a freelancer.

453
00:32:24,266 --> 00:32:26,300
But this lot are rebuilding them.

454
00:32:26,348 --> 00:32:30,980
They've been using the river,
so they've got the end result. . .

455
00:32:31,026 --> 00:32:34,142
Huon particles in liquid form.

456
00:32:34,186 --> 00:32:36,262
And that's what's inside me ?

457
00:32:41,025 --> 00:32:43,141
Oh, my God.

458
00:32:44,705 --> 00:32:47,141
Genius ! Cos the particles are inert.

459
00:32:47,186 --> 00:32:50,543
They need something living to
catalyse inside, and that's you !

460
00:32:50,586 --> 00:32:53,420
Saturate the body, then. . .

461
00:32:53,468 --> 00:32:56,382
Oh ! The wedding !
Yes ! You were getting married !

462
00:32:56,426 --> 00:32:58,060
Best day of your life. . .

463
00:32:58,105 --> 00:32:59,783
Oh, your body's a battleground.

464
00:32:59,826 --> 00:33:04,900
It's a chemical war inside -
adrenalin, acetylcholine, wham go
the endorphins. Oh, you're cooking !

465
00:33:04,948 --> 00:33:08,062
You're like a pressure cooker,
a microwave, all churning away.

466
00:33:08,108 --> 00:33:10,860
The particles reach
boiling point, shazam !

467
00:33:10,908 --> 00:33:12,861
What did I do this time ?  !

468
00:33:12,908 --> 00:33:14,703
Are you enjoying this ?

469
00:33:17,426 --> 00:33:19,220
Right, just tell me,

470
00:33:19,265 --> 00:33:23,940
these particles,
are they dangerous ? Am I safe ?

471
00:33:23,987 --> 00:33:26,103
Yes !

472
00:33:26,145 --> 00:33:28,820
Doctor.

473
00:33:30,948 --> 00:33:33,900
If your lot got rid of
Huon particles,

474
00:33:33,946 --> 00:33:36,061
why did they do that ?

475
00:33:36,107 --> 00:33:37,983
Because they were deadly.

476
00:33:38,025 --> 00:33:40,541
Oh, my God.

477
00:33:40,588 --> 00:33:43,262
Whatever's been done to you,
I'll reverse it.

478
00:33:43,308 --> 00:33:45,260
I am not about to lose someone else.

479
00:33:45,305 --> 00:33:50,261
Oh, she is long since lost.

480
00:33:54,587 --> 00:33:58,780
I have waited so long,

481
00:33:58,826 --> 00:34:02,462
hibernating at the edge of
the universe

482
00:34:02,505 --> 00:34:07,140
until the secret heart was
uncovered and called out to waken. . .

483
00:34:17,187 --> 00:34:19,700
Someone's been digging.

484
00:34:21,188 --> 00:34:23,900
Oh, very Torchwood.
Drilled by laser.

485
00:34:23,947 --> 00:34:26,140
How far down does it go ?

486
00:34:26,188 --> 00:34:30,541
Down and down. All the way
to the centre of the earth.

487
00:34:30,587 --> 00:34:32,503
Really ?

488
00:34:32,546 --> 00:34:34,900
Seriously ? What for ?

489
00:34:34,947 --> 00:34:36,701
Dinosaurs. What ?

490
00:34:36,748 --> 00:34:39,581
Dinosaurs ?
What are you on about, dinosaurs ?

491
00:34:39,627 --> 00:34:41,261
That film, with dinosaurs.

492
00:34:41,306 --> 00:34:43,582
I'm trying to help.
That's not helping.

493
00:34:43,627 --> 00:34:46,502
Such a sweet couple.

494
00:34:46,548 --> 00:34:51,423
Only a madman talks to thin air,
and trust me, you don't want
to make me mad. Where are you ?

495
00:34:51,466 --> 00:34:54,220
High in the sky. . .

496
00:34:54,266 --> 00:34:59,580
Floating so high on Christmas night.

497
00:34:59,625 --> 00:35:02,223
I didn't come all this way
to talk on the intercom.

498
00:35:02,265 --> 00:35:05,701
Come on ! Let's have a look at you !

499
00:35:05,747 --> 00:35:07,741
Who are you, with such command ?

500
00:35:07,788 --> 00:35:09,383
I'm The Doctor.

501
00:35:09,425 --> 00:35:16,180
Prepare your best medicines,
Doctor-man,
for you will be sick at heart.

502
00:35:23,547 --> 00:35:26,662
Racnoss.

503
00:35:26,708 --> 00:35:29,063
But that's impossible.
You're one of the Racnoss.

504
00:35:29,105 --> 00:35:33,463
Empress of the Racnoss.

505
00:35:39,348 --> 00:35:42,383
If you're the Empress,
where's the rest of the Racnoss ?

506
00:35:42,425 --> 00:35:44,782
Or are you the only one ?

507
00:35:44,828 --> 00:35:48,262
Such a sharp mind.

508
00:35:48,306 --> 00:35:50,141
That's it - the last of your kind.

509
00:35:50,188 --> 00:35:53,021
The Racnoss come from the
dark times, billions of years ago.

510
00:35:53,067 --> 00:35:56,020
They were carnivores, omnivores,
they devoured whole planets.

511
00:35:56,065 --> 00:36:01,503
Racnoss are born starving -
is that our fault ?

512
00:36:02,506 --> 00:36:05,503
They eat people ?

513
00:36:05,547 --> 00:36:08,423
HC Clements, did he wear
those black and white shoes ?

514
00:36:08,465 --> 00:36:13,460
He did. We used to laugh, we used
to call him the Fat Cat in Spats.

515
00:36:15,105 --> 00:36:17,500
Oh, my God !

516
00:36:17,548 --> 00:36:20,700
My Christmas dinner.

517
00:36:20,747 --> 00:36:22,463
You shouldn't even exist.

518
00:36:22,505 --> 00:36:27,780
Way back in history, the
fledglingempires went to war against
the Racnoss. They were wiped out.

519
00:36:27,828 --> 00:36:29,422
Except for me.

520
00:36:29,466 --> 00:36:33,540
That's what I've got inside me,
that Huon energy thing. Oi !

521
00:36:33,588 --> 00:36:35,300
Look at me, lady, I'm talking !

522
00:36:35,348 --> 00:36:36,940
Where do I fit in ?

523
00:36:36,985 --> 00:36:39,821
How come I get all stacked up
with these Huon particles ?

524
00:36:39,866 --> 00:36:41,863
Look at me, you !

525
00:36:41,905 --> 00:36:46,302
Look me in the eye and tell me !
The bride is so feisty !

526
00:36:46,345 --> 00:36:48,500
Yes, I am !

527
00:36:48,546 --> 00:36:51,983
And I don't know what you are,
you big. . .thing,

528
00:36:52,025 --> 00:36:53,860
but a spider's just a spider. . .

529
00:36:53,906 --> 00:36:57,543
and an axe is an axe,

530
00:36:57,585 --> 00:36:59,620
now DO IT !

531
00:37:03,706 --> 00:37:05,502
LANCE LAUGHS

532
00:37:10,505 --> 00:37:13,780
That was a good one. Your face !

533
00:37:13,827 --> 00:37:16,300
Lance is funny.

534
00:37:16,345 --> 00:37:22,020
What ? I'm sorry. Sorry for what ?
Lance, don't be so stupid - get her !

535
00:37:22,065 --> 00:37:24,220
God, she's thick !

536
00:37:24,268 --> 00:37:27,703
Months I've had to
put up with her, months !

537
00:37:27,745 --> 00:37:30,741
A woman who can't even point
to Germany on a map !

538
00:37:34,426 --> 00:37:36,422
I don't understand.

539
00:37:36,465 --> 00:37:39,382
How did you meet him ?

540
00:37:39,427 --> 00:37:42,860
In the office. He made you coffee.

541
00:37:42,907 --> 00:37:44,663
What ?

542
00:37:44,707 --> 00:37:48,621
Every day, I made you coffee.

543
00:37:48,666 --> 00:37:53,382
You had to be dosed with liquid
particles over six months.

544
00:37:54,827 --> 00:37:56,622
He was poisoning me ?

545
00:37:58,345 --> 00:38:00,300
It was all there in the job title.

546
00:38:00,347 --> 00:38:02,140
The head of human resources.

547
00:38:02,187 --> 00:38:04,941
This time, it's personnel.

548
00:38:06,546 --> 00:38:10,582
But. . .we were getting married.

549
00:38:10,627 --> 00:38:13,222
Well, I couldn't risk
you running off !

550
00:38:13,268 --> 00:38:18,381
Then I was stuck with a woman
who thinks the height of excitement
is a new flavour Pringle !

551
00:38:18,426 --> 00:38:22,463
Oh, I had to sit there and listen
to all that yap yap yap. . .

552
00:38:22,507 --> 00:38:25,581
"Ooh, Brad and Angelina. . .
Is Posh pregnant ?

553
00:38:25,626 --> 00:38:31,501
"X Factor, Atkins Diet,
Feng Shui, split ends, text me,
text me, text me. . ."

554
00:38:31,546 --> 00:38:35,423
Dear God, the never-ending
fountain of fat, stupid trivia !

555
00:38:36,906 --> 00:38:38,742
I deserve a medal !

556
00:38:38,787 --> 00:38:41,902
Is that what she's offered you ?
The Empress of the Racnoss ?

557
00:38:41,948 --> 00:38:44,222
What are you, her consort ?

558
00:38:44,267 --> 00:38:47,023
It's better than a night with her.

559
00:38:47,066 --> 00:38:52,103
But I love you.
That's what made it easy.

560
00:38:52,146 --> 00:38:54,382
It's like you said, Doctor.

561
00:38:54,428 --> 00:38:56,621
The big picture.

562
00:38:56,665 --> 00:38:59,102
What's the point of it all
if the human race is nothing ?

563
00:38:59,147 --> 00:39:01,463
That's what the Empress
can give me -

564
00:39:01,505 --> 00:39:04,782
the chance to go out there,

565
00:39:04,826 --> 00:39:08,181
to see it, the size of it all.

566
00:39:08,227 --> 00:39:13,023
And I think you understand that,
don't you, Doctor ?

567
00:39:13,067 --> 00:39:16,262
Who is this little physician ?

568
00:39:16,307 --> 00:39:20,982
She said, Martian.
Oh, I'm sort of homeless.

569
00:39:21,027 --> 00:39:22,583
But the point is, what's down here ?

570
00:39:22,628 --> 00:39:26,101
The Racnoss are extinct. What's
gonna help you, 4, 000 miles down ?

571
00:39:26,146 --> 00:39:27,943
That's just the molten core
of the earth.

572
00:39:27,985 --> 00:39:31,663
I think he wants us to talk.
I think so too.

573
00:39:31,708 --> 00:39:33,821
Well, tough. All we need is Donna.

574
00:39:33,865 --> 00:39:37,660
Kill this chattering
little Doctor-man.

575
00:39:37,708 --> 00:39:40,782
Don't you hurt him ! No, it's
all right. No, I won't let them.

576
00:39:40,825 --> 00:39:42,660
At arms !

577
00:39:42,705 --> 00:39:46,783
Ah, now. . .except. . . Take aim !

578
00:39:46,828 --> 00:39:48,542
I just want to point out
the obvious.

579
00:39:48,586 --> 00:39:53,261
They won't hit the bride,
they're such very good shots.

580
00:39:53,306 --> 00:39:55,220
Just hold on. . .
Hold on just a tick,

581
00:39:55,267 --> 00:39:57,382
just a tiny little. . .just a tick. . .

582
00:39:57,427 --> 00:39:58,980
If you think about it,

583
00:39:59,028 --> 00:40:03,061
the particles activated in Donna,
and drew her inside my spaceship.

584
00:40:03,106 --> 00:40:08,021
So, reverse it. . .
and the spaceship comes to her !

585
00:40:08,068 --> 00:40:10,941
Fire !

586
00:40:10,988 --> 00:40:14,381
And off we go ! The key !

587
00:40:14,427 --> 00:40:18,221
My ke-e-e-ey !

588
00:40:18,268 --> 00:40:20,260
TARDIS THRUMS

589
00:40:22,185 --> 00:40:26,701
Oh. D'you know what you said
before, about a time machine ?
Well, I lied.

590
00:40:26,746 --> 00:40:28,741
And now we're gonna use it.

591
00:40:28,787 --> 00:40:31,903
We need to find out what the Empress
of the Racnoss is digging up.

592
00:40:31,945 --> 00:40:34,062
If something's buried
at the planet's core,

593
00:40:34,107 --> 00:40:37,701
it must've been there
since the beginning.
I've always wanted to see this.

594
00:40:37,746 --> 00:40:40,982
Donna, we're going further back
than I've ever been before !

595
00:40:45,106 --> 00:40:49,860
If a key is lost,
then another must be cut.

596
00:40:49,907 --> 00:40:53,142
At a-a-a-a-arms !

597
00:41:03,786 --> 00:41:06,422
We've arrived.

598
00:41:06,466 --> 00:41:08,020
D'you want to see ?

599
00:41:09,665 --> 00:41:11,220
Suppose.

600
00:41:13,786 --> 00:41:17,300
Hold on, scanner's a bit small.
Maybe your way's best.

601
00:41:20,466 --> 00:41:22,181
Come on.

602
00:41:26,145 --> 00:41:29,062
No human's ever seen this.
You'll be the first.

603
00:41:29,107 --> 00:41:31,302
All I want to see is my bed.

604
00:41:33,585 --> 00:41:36,142
Donna Noble. Welcome. . .

605
00:41:36,186 --> 00:41:37,823
to the creation of the Earth.

606
00:41:43,868 --> 00:41:48,062
We've gone back 4.6 billion years.

607
00:41:48,106 --> 00:41:50,983
There's no solar system, not yet.

608
00:41:51,025 --> 00:41:54,220
Only dust and rocks and gas.

609
00:41:54,267 --> 00:41:56,423
That's the sun, over there.

610
00:41:56,465 --> 00:41:58,063
Brand new.

611
00:41:58,107 --> 00:41:59,781
Just beginning to burn.

612
00:42:01,827 --> 00:42:03,543
Where's the Earth ?

613
00:42:03,587 --> 00:42:05,661
All around us.

614
00:42:05,705 --> 00:42:07,223
In the dust.

615
00:42:11,988 --> 00:42:14,103
Puts the wedding in perspective.

616
00:42:15,627 --> 00:42:19,381
Lance was right, we're just. . .tiny.

617
00:42:19,426 --> 00:42:23,141
No, but that's what you do,
the human race,

618
00:42:23,188 --> 00:42:25,660
make sense out of chaos.

619
00:42:25,707 --> 00:42:27,780
Marking it out with

620
00:42:27,825 --> 00:42:31,180
weddings and Christmas
and calendars.

621
00:42:31,227 --> 00:42:36,943
This whole process is beautiful,
but only if it's being observed.

622
00:42:38,505 --> 00:42:40,941
So I came out of all this ?

623
00:42:40,986 --> 00:42:42,663
Isn't that brilliant ?

624
00:42:47,945 --> 00:42:50,301
I think that's the Isle of Wight.

625
00:42:53,667 --> 00:42:55,823
Eventually, gravity takes hold.

626
00:42:55,867 --> 00:42:59,660
One big rock, heavier than others,
starts to pull other rocks
towards it.

627
00:42:59,706 --> 00:43:05,021
All the dust and gas and elements
get pulled in, everything piling in,
until you get. . . The Earth.

628
00:43:05,067 --> 00:43:09,740
But the question is,
what was that first rock ?

629
00:43:11,346 --> 00:43:13,262
Look. . .

630
00:43:14,788 --> 00:43:16,381
The Racnoss.

631
00:43:19,305 --> 00:43:22,460
Now I have measured the bride's
catalysis,

632
00:43:22,508 --> 00:43:26,222
I can force-feed it.

633
00:43:26,267 --> 00:43:29,980
Drink the particles,
become the key !

634
00:43:34,585 --> 00:43:38,382
Hold on, the Racnoss are hiding
from the war. What's it doing ?

635
00:43:38,427 --> 00:43:40,541
Exactly what you said !

636
00:43:44,227 --> 00:43:47,863
Oh ! They didn't just bury something
at the centre of the Earth !

637
00:43:47,908 --> 00:43:50,541
They BECAME the centre of the Earth.

638
00:43:50,586 --> 00:43:52,180
The first rock.

639
00:43:52,228 --> 00:43:53,300
EXPLOSION

640
00:43:53,346 --> 00:43:55,140
What was that ?

641
00:43:55,187 --> 00:43:56,342
Trouble.

642
00:43:56,385 --> 00:43:59,983
My wonderful key !

643
00:44:00,025 --> 00:44:03,342
Now, my servants, bind him !

644
00:44:04,065 --> 00:44:06,821
What the hell's it doing ?  !

645
00:44:06,867 --> 00:44:09,982
That little trick of mine,
particles pulling particles -

646
00:44:10,025 --> 00:44:12,623
it works in reverse.
They're pulling us back !

647
00:44:15,747 --> 00:44:18,743
Well, can't you stop it ?
Hasn't it got a handbrake ?

648
00:44:18,785 --> 00:44:22,100
Can't you reverse,
or, warp, or beam, or something ?

649
00:44:22,147 --> 00:44:24,823
Back-seat driver !
Oh ! Wait a minute.

650
00:44:25,588 --> 00:44:28,300
The extrapolator !

651
00:44:28,345 --> 00:44:31,822
Can't stop us,
but should give us a good bump !

652
00:44:33,348 --> 00:44:38,660
The bride shall join her groom -
what a wedding there shall be.

653
00:44:38,708 --> 00:44:39,861
Now !

654
00:44:44,626 --> 00:44:49,461
We've gone about 200 yards
to the right. Come on !

655
00:44:51,588 --> 00:44:56,380
She is close,
the holy bride in white !

656
00:44:56,426 --> 00:44:58,663
Find her ! Find her !

657
00:45:03,627 --> 00:45:08,301
What do we do ?  ! I don't know !
I'm making it up as I go along.
But trust me, I've got history.

658
00:45:08,347 --> 00:45:10,541
But I still don't understand.

659
00:45:10,585 --> 00:45:14,381
I'm full of particles,
but what for ? There's a Racnoss web

660
00:45:14,428 --> 00:45:19,942
at the centre of the Earth.
My people unravelled their power
source, so the Racnoss were stuck.

661
00:45:19,986 --> 00:45:23,182
They hibernated for billions
of years, frozen, dead, kaput !

662
00:45:23,227 --> 00:45:25,981
You're the new key -
brand-new living particles.

663
00:45:26,028 --> 00:45:30,903
They need you to open it. And you
have never been so quiet. Oh !

664
00:45:39,468 --> 00:45:43,623
I hate you. Yeah, I think we've gone
a bit beyond that now, sweetheart.

665
00:45:43,668 --> 00:45:46,620
My golden couple.

666
00:45:46,665 --> 00:45:51,783
Together at last,
your awful wedded life.

667
00:45:51,825 --> 00:45:55,142
Tell me, do you want
to be released ?

668
00:45:55,188 --> 00:45:59,743
Yes ! You're supposed to say, "I do."

669
00:45:59,787 --> 00:46:01,502
No chance.

670
00:46:01,547 --> 00:46:03,382
Say it !

671
00:46:08,145 --> 00:46:10,743
I do. I do.

672
00:46:11,625 --> 00:46:14,140
I. . .don't !

673
00:46:14,188 --> 00:46:17,661
Activate the particles !

674
00:46:17,705 --> 00:46:20,182
Purge every last one !

675
00:46:23,705 --> 00:46:25,103
And release !

676
00:46:27,465 --> 00:46:30,541
The Secret Heart unlocks

677
00:46:30,586 --> 00:46:35,503
and they will waken
from their sleep of ages.

678
00:46:35,547 --> 00:46:36,822
Who will ?

679
00:46:36,867 --> 00:46:38,383
What's down there ?

680
00:46:38,425 --> 00:46:40,823
How thick are you ?  !

681
00:46:40,866 --> 00:46:42,341
My children !

682
00:46:44,068 --> 00:46:50,543
The long-lost Racnoss,
now reborn to feast on flesh.

683
00:46:52,626 --> 00:46:55,742
The Webstar shall come to me.

684
00:47:00,707 --> 00:47:02,822
My babies will be hungry.

685
00:47:02,867 --> 00:47:05,660
They need sustenance.

686
00:47:05,705 --> 00:47:08,340
No. . . Perish the web.

687
00:47:08,387 --> 00:47:12,140
Use her, not me, use her !

688
00:47:12,188 --> 00:47:14,342
Oh, my funny little Lance.

689
00:47:14,388 --> 00:47:20,022
But you were quite impolite
to your lady-friend.

690
00:47:20,065 --> 00:47:22,661
The Empress does not approve.

691
00:47:27,628 --> 00:47:30,823
NO-O-O-O-O !

692
00:47:41,586 --> 00:47:43,620
It's Christmas !

693
00:47:43,668 --> 00:47:49,021
Harvest the humans !
Reduce them to meat !

694
00:48:07,587 --> 00:48:09,662
SHE SCREAMS

695
00:48:15,708 --> 00:48:21,741
My children are climbing towards me
and none shall stop them !

696
00:48:24,667 --> 00:48:30,143
So you might as well unmask,
my clever little Doctor-man.

697
00:48:30,185 --> 00:48:34,141
Oh, well, nice try.

698
00:48:34,186 --> 00:48:39,063
I've got you, Donna.
I'm gonna fall ! You're gonna swing !

699
00:48:41,547 --> 00:48:42,701
I've got you.

700
00:48:42,748 --> 00:48:43,862
SHE SCREAMS

701
00:48:46,427 --> 00:48:49,662
CLANGING

702
00:48:49,708 --> 00:48:51,861
Ooh, sorry.

703
00:48:51,908 --> 00:48:55,063
Thanks for nothing.

704
00:48:55,107 --> 00:48:58,823
The Doctor-man amuses me.

705
00:48:58,865 --> 00:49:02,301
Empress of the Racnoss,
I give you one last chance.

706
00:49:02,345 --> 00:49:07,182
I can find you a planet, I can
find you and your children a place
in the universe to co-exist.

707
00:49:07,226 --> 00:49:11,063
Take that offer, and end this now.

708
00:49:11,107 --> 00:49:14,542
These men are so funny !

709
00:49:14,588 --> 00:49:16,820
What's your answer ?

710
00:49:16,868 --> 00:49:19,860
Oh, I'm afraId I have to decline.

711
00:49:19,905 --> 00:49:22,183
Then what happens next
is your own doing.

712
00:49:22,228 --> 00:49:25,543
I'll show you what happens next !

713
00:49:26,625 --> 00:49:29,063
At arms !

714
00:49:29,107 --> 00:49:31,502
Take aim !

715
00:49:33,745 --> 00:49:35,300
And. . . relax.

716
00:49:39,748 --> 00:49:43,980
What did you do ?
Guess what I've got, Donna.

717
00:49:44,665 --> 00:49:46,503
Pockets !

718
00:49:46,548 --> 00:49:48,381
How did that fit in there ?

719
00:49:48,426 --> 00:49:50,302
They're bigger on the inside.

720
00:49:50,345 --> 00:49:53,381
Roboforms are not necessary.

721
00:49:53,425 --> 00:49:56,301
My children may feast
on Martian flesh.

722
00:49:56,347 --> 00:49:58,463
Oh, but I'm not from Mars.

723
00:49:58,508 --> 00:50:00,540
Then where ?

724
00:50:00,588 --> 00:50:04,703
My home planet is far away
and long since gone.

725
00:50:04,745 --> 00:50:06,381
But its name lives on.

726
00:50:07,907 --> 00:50:10,142
Gallifrey.

727
00:50:10,186 --> 00:50:12,783
They murdered the Racnoss !

728
00:50:12,825 --> 00:50:15,620
I warned you.

729
00:50:15,666 --> 00:50:17,501
You did this.

730
00:50:17,548 --> 00:50:21,141
No ! No ! Don't !

731
00:50:22,626 --> 00:50:24,181
NO-O-O !

732
00:50:24,226 --> 00:50:27,140
No ! NO !

733
00:50:27,188 --> 00:50:29,980
NO-O-O !

734
00:50:30,028 --> 00:50:31,781
NO-O-O-O-O !

735
00:50:54,228 --> 00:50:55,981
NO-O-O !

736
00:51:06,305 --> 00:51:10,823
NO ! My children !

737
00:51:13,705 --> 00:51:16,060
SHE SCREAMS

738
00:51:18,345 --> 00:51:20,783
My children !

739
00:51:28,428 --> 00:51:33,940
My children !

740
00:51:33,988 --> 00:51:36,461
Doctor !

741
00:51:36,507 --> 00:51:38,582
You can stop now.

742
00:51:38,628 --> 00:51:43,143
My children !

743
00:51:43,187 --> 00:51:45,660
EMPRESS SCREAMS

744
00:51:49,346 --> 00:51:51,543
Come on. Time I got you out.

745
00:52:01,506 --> 00:52:05,342
Transport me !

746
00:52:11,025 --> 00:52:14,263
Oh, they will suffer, so suffer.

747
00:52:14,306 --> 00:52:18,183
This planet shall be scorched.

748
00:52:18,227 --> 00:52:21,301
But what about the Empress ?

749
00:52:21,346 --> 00:52:24,542
She's used up all her Huon
energy - she's defenceless.

750
00:52:32,907 --> 00:52:34,821
Orders from Mr Saxon. Fire at will.

751
00:52:34,867 --> 00:52:36,103
FIRE !

752
00:53:06,627 --> 00:53:08,900
DONNA SQUEALS

753
00:53:17,826 --> 00:53:21,103
There's just one problem.

754
00:53:21,148 --> 00:53:24,862
What is it ?
We've drained the Thames.

755
00:53:27,107 --> 00:53:30,340
SHIPS' HORNS SOUND

756
00:53:36,546 --> 00:53:41,620
There we go, told you she'd be
all right. Survive anything.

757
00:53:41,665 --> 00:53:43,662
More than I've done.

758
00:53:48,025 --> 00:53:50,180
No, all the Huon particles
have gone.

759
00:53:50,225 --> 00:53:54,783
No damage. You're fine.
Yeah, but apart from that.

760
00:53:54,827 --> 00:54:01,102
I missed my wedding, lost
my job, and became a widow
on the same day. . .sort of.

761
00:54:01,145 --> 00:54:03,742
I couldn't save him.

762
00:54:03,785 --> 00:54:05,700
He deserved it.

763
00:54:09,707 --> 00:54:11,341
No, he didn't.

764
00:54:14,228 --> 00:54:16,182
Better get inside.

765
00:54:16,227 --> 00:54:20,381
They'll be worried. Best
Christmas present they could have.

766
00:54:20,428 --> 00:54:23,621
Oh, no !
I forgot, you hate Christmas.

767
00:54:23,665 --> 00:54:25,861
Yes, I do.

768
00:54:25,906 --> 00:54:30,180
Even. . .if it snows ?

769
00:54:40,786 --> 00:54:43,340
I can't believe you did that.

770
00:54:43,385 --> 00:54:46,141
Basic atmospheric excitation.

771
00:54:51,185 --> 00:54:53,661
Merry Christmas.

772
00:54:53,708 --> 00:54:54,940
And you.

773
00:54:59,908 --> 00:55:01,902
So. . .

774
00:55:01,947 --> 00:55:05,781
what will you do with yourself now ?

775
00:55:05,826 --> 00:55:08,263
Not getting married, for starters.

776
00:55:08,307 --> 00:55:10,700
And I'm not gonna temp any more.

777
00:55:10,746 --> 00:55:13,543
I dunno, travel.

778
00:55:13,588 --> 00:55:15,302
See a bit more of Planet Earth.

779
00:55:15,346 --> 00:55:17,300
Walk in the dust.

780
00:55:19,148 --> 00:55:23,783
Just go out there and do something.

781
00:55:25,386 --> 00:55:29,941
Well, you could always. . . What ?

782
00:55:31,145 --> 00:55:33,060
Come with me.

783
00:55:33,987 --> 00:55:35,540
No.

784
00:55:35,586 --> 00:55:37,023
OK.

785
00:55:37,068 --> 00:55:38,903
I can't. No, that's fine.

786
00:55:38,947 --> 00:55:40,462
No, but really.

787
00:55:40,508 --> 00:55:43,260
I mean, everything we did today. . .

788
00:55:43,306 --> 00:55:45,541
D'you live your life like that ?

789
00:55:47,265 --> 00:55:49,460
Not all the time.

790
00:55:49,508 --> 00:55:51,102
I think you do.

791
00:55:52,745 --> 00:55:54,421
And I couldn't.

792
00:55:55,785 --> 00:55:58,301
You've seen it out there.

793
00:55:59,228 --> 00:56:02,342
It's beautiful. And it's terrible.

794
00:56:02,388 --> 00:56:07,741
That place was flooding,
and burning, and they were dying,
and you stood there like. . .

795
00:56:07,785 --> 00:56:10,700
I don't know.

796
00:56:10,748 --> 00:56:12,703
A stranger.

797
00:56:12,745 --> 00:56:17,260
And then you made it snow.
I mean, you scare me to death.

798
00:56:19,827 --> 00:56:22,103
Well, then.

799
00:56:24,628 --> 00:56:26,623
Tell you what I will do, though.

800
00:56:26,668 --> 00:56:27,901
Christmas dinner.

801
00:56:29,106 --> 00:56:30,660
Oh, come on !

802
00:56:30,707 --> 00:56:34,021
I don't do that sort of thing.
You did it last year, you said so.

803
00:56:34,068 --> 00:56:38,541
And you might as well, because
Mum always cooks enough for 20.
Well. . .

804
00:56:41,267 --> 00:56:45,141
Oh, all right, then !
But you go first - better warn them.

805
00:56:45,185 --> 00:56:47,300
And don't say I'm a Martian.

806
00:56:47,346 --> 00:56:51,743
I just have to park her properly,
she might drift off
to the Middle Ages.

807
00:56:51,786 --> 00:56:53,262
I'll see you in a minute.

808
00:56:56,185 --> 00:57:00,422
TARDIS THRUMS
Doctor ! DOCTOR !

809
00:57:00,466 --> 00:57:03,781
THRUMMING STOPS
Blimey, you can shout.

810
00:57:05,666 --> 00:57:08,221
Am I ever going to see you again ?

811
00:57:08,266 --> 00:57:14,382
If I'm lucky.
Just. . .promise me one thing.

812
00:57:16,268 --> 00:57:18,701
Find someone.

813
00:57:19,788 --> 00:57:22,660
I don't need anyone. Yes, you do.

814
00:57:22,707 --> 00:57:26,700
Cos sometimes. . .I think
you need someone to stop you.

815
00:57:29,267 --> 00:57:30,782
Yeah.

816
00:57:33,065 --> 00:57:35,660
Thanks, then, Donna. Good luck.

817
00:57:35,708 --> 00:57:37,863
And just. . .

818
00:57:39,465 --> 00:57:41,342
 .be magnificent.

819
00:57:43,908 --> 00:57:46,140
I think I will, yeah.

820
00:57:49,508 --> 00:57:50,861
Doctor ?

821
00:57:50,907 --> 00:57:52,583
Oh, what is it now ?

822
00:57:54,587 --> 00:57:58,061
That friend of yours.
What was her name ?

823
00:57:59,028 --> 00:58:01,740
Her name was Rose.

824
00:58:26,466 --> 00:58:29,700
I'm The Doctor.
Me too, if I ever pass my exams.

825
00:58:29,748 --> 00:58:31,701
What was your name ? Martha Jones.

826
00:58:33,228 --> 00:58:36,223
Rose. Not that you're replacing her.
Never said I was. .

827
00:58:36,267 --> 00:58:38,062
EVIL CACKLE

828
00:58:38,105 --> 00:58:39,820
SHOUTING AND SCREAMING

829
00:58:39,865 --> 00:58:41,383
It's started.

830
00:58:48,627 --> 00:58:50,302
Let her go !

831
00:58:51,907 --> 00:58:54,343
The Globe Theatre.

832
00:58:54,385 --> 00:58:56,422
Mr Shakespeare, isn't it ?

833
00:58:56,465 --> 00:58:58,700
What are you standing there for ?
Come on !

834
00:59:01,106 --> 00:59:03,023
Very well dressed for a hitch-hiker.

835
00:59:08,425 --> 00:59:10,101
NO-O-O !

836
00:59:16,628 --> 00:59:18,421
Don't let go !

837
00:59:18,466 --> 00:59:21,503
Tonight, I am going to perform
a miracle.

838
00:59:22,705 --> 00:59:25,222
I am 76 years old.
