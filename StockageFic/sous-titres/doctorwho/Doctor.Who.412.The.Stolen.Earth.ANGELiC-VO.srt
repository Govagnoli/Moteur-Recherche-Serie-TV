1
00:00:05,545 --> 00:00:06,559
It's fine...

2
00:00:08,211 --> 00:00:09,568
Everything's fine.

3
00:00:10,206 --> 00:00:11,806
Nothing's wrong. All fine!

4
00:00:12,457 --> 00:00:14,728
'Scuse me! What day is it?

5
00:00:14,828 --> 00:00:16,780
- Saturday.
- Saturday.

6
00:00:16,954 --> 00:00:17,705
Good.

7
00:00:18,595 --> 00:00:22,110
- Good, I like Saturdays.
- So, I just met Rose Tyler?

8
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:23,142
Yeah.

9
00:00:23,818 --> 00:00:25,620
<i>But she's locked away
in a parallel world.</i>

10
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:26,493
Exactly.

11
00:00:26,593 --> 00:00:28,889
If she can cross from her world,
to your parallel world,

12
00:00:28,989 --> 00:00:30,897
the walls of the universe
are breaking down.

13
00:00:30,997 --> 00:00:33,866
Which puts everything in danger,
everything!

14
00:00:35,593 --> 00:00:36,531
But how?!

15
00:01:07,959 --> 00:01:08,990
Thing is, Doctor.

16
00:01:09,808 --> 00:01:13,011
No matter what's happening,
and I'm sure it's bad, I get that,

17
00:01:15,876 --> 00:01:16,421
but...

18
00:01:16,721 --> 00:01:19,870
Rose is coming back.
Isn't that good?

19
00:01:22,149 --> 00:01:22,701
Yeah.

20
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:28,485
- What the hell was that?!
- It came from outside.

21
00:01:36,296 --> 00:01:37,764
But... we're in space.

22
00:01:38,396 --> 00:01:39,685
How did that happen?

23
00:01:40,129 --> 00:01:41,330
<i>What did you do?</i>

24
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:45,591
We haven't moved, we're fixed...

25
00:01:48,318 --> 00:01:50,102
It can't have! No!

26
00:01:52,648 --> 00:01:55,290
The TARDIS is still in the same place.
But the Earth has gone.

27
00:01:56,967 --> 00:01:58,193
The entire planet.

28
00:01:59,682 --> 00:02:00,514
It's gone.

29
00:02:01,810 --> 00:02:05,830
FAR ACCROSS THE UNIVERSE...

30
00:02:07,586 --> 00:02:08,619
<i>Right now!</i>

31
00:02:08,883 --> 00:02:12,346
<i>Confirm all stations on line,
can anyone hear me?</i>

32
00:02:12,446 --> 00:02:13,729
<i>Have you got contact...</i>

33
00:02:13,908 --> 00:02:15,110
What was that?

34
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:19,245
Some sort of earthquake, or...

35
00:02:21,228 --> 00:02:22,859
Jalandra, you all right?

36
00:02:24,739 --> 00:02:28,306
Is anyone hurt? We've lost power,
will someone get the lights back on.

37
00:02:28,406 --> 00:02:29,926
DaCosta, see to it right now!

38
00:02:30,796 --> 00:02:34,990
- Suzanne, are you OK?
- Martha.

39
00:02:35,464 --> 00:02:37,547
- Look at the sky.
- Why, what is it?

40
00:02:37,810 --> 00:02:39,599
Just look at the sky!

41
00:02:40,707 --> 00:02:42,853
Whoa! What happened?

42
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:47,340
Was it the Rift?
Gwen, Ianto, you OK?

43
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:49,881
No broken bones.
Slight loss of dignity.

44
00:02:50,043 --> 00:02:52,667
- No change there then.
- The whole city must've felt that...

45
00:02:52,942 --> 00:02:55,263
- the whole of South Wales!
- I'll look outside.

46
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:04,430
Little bit bigger than South Wales.

47
00:03:07,536 --> 00:03:10,230
Luke, are you all right?

48
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:15,549
Felt like some sort of
cross-dimensional spatial transference.

49
00:03:15,931 --> 00:03:19,391
But it's night! It wasn't night,
it was eight o'clock in the morning...

50
00:03:19,579 --> 00:03:21,110
Mr Smith! I need you!

51
00:03:24,017 --> 00:03:27,039
I wish you'd stop giving that fanfare,
you just tell me what happened?

52
00:03:27,139 --> 00:03:29,692
<i>Sarah Jane,
I think you should look outside.</i>

53
00:03:30,048 --> 00:03:32,973
<i>I think you'll find the visual
evidence most conclusive.</i>

54
00:03:34,085 --> 00:03:35,192
It's gone dark!

55
00:03:35,793 --> 00:03:38,239
It's them aliens, I'll bet my pension!

56
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:41,083
What d'you want this time,
you green swine!

57
00:03:41,183 --> 00:03:41,895
Dad...

58
00:03:42,258 --> 00:03:45,524
Look, you get back inside, Sylvia.
They always want the women!

59
00:03:45,624 --> 00:03:50,070
No, Dad, just look. Oh, my God.
Look at the sky!

60
00:03:53,321 --> 00:03:54,630
That's impossible...

61
00:03:54,824 --> 00:03:56,190
That's just impossible...

62
00:03:58,484 --> 00:03:59,898
It can't be...

63
00:04:17,939 --> 00:04:19,709
Right, now we're in trouble...

64
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:23,357
And it's only just beginning.

69
00:05:11,412 --> 00:05:13,577
But if the Earth's been moved,

70
00:05:14,399 --> 00:05:15,466
they've lost the sun!

71
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,012
What about my Mum?

72
00:05:17,675 --> 00:05:20,103
And Grandad? They're dead,

73
00:05:21,755 --> 00:05:23,044
aren't they? Are they dead?

74
00:05:23,144 --> 00:05:25,790
I don't know, Donna, I'm sorry,
I don't know...

75
00:05:27,317 --> 00:05:28,429
That's my family.

76
00:05:29,543 --> 00:05:32,550
- My whole world.
- There's no readings. Nothing.

77
00:05:33,316 --> 00:05:34,467
Not a trace.

78
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:38,350
Not even a whisper.
Oh, that is fearsome technology.

79
00:05:39,795 --> 00:05:41,830
- So what do we do?
- We've got to get help.

80
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:43,874
From where?

81
00:05:45,062 --> 00:05:45,851
Donna...

82
00:05:46,665 --> 00:05:48,761
I'm taking you to the
Shadow Proclamation.

83
00:05:50,191 --> 00:05:51,350
Hold tight!

84
00:05:57,530 --> 00:06:01,948
The United Nations has issued an edict,
asking the citizens of the world

85
00:06:02,048 --> 00:06:03,180
not to panic.

86
00:06:03,607 --> 00:06:04,633
So far,

87
00:06:04,733 --> 00:06:09,230
there has been no explanation of the 26
planets which have appeared in the sky.

88
00:06:09,777 --> 00:06:11,761
But it's an empirical fact!

89
00:06:11,861 --> 00:06:14,745
The planets didn't come to us,
we came to them!

90
00:06:14,845 --> 00:06:16,241
Just look at the stars.

91
00:06:16,341 --> 00:06:20,390
We're in a completely different region
of space, we've travelled.

92
00:06:20,652 --> 00:06:23,567
D'you know what, I look up,
and there's all these moons and things!

93
00:06:23,667 --> 00:06:25,030
Have you seen them?

94
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:29,164
I thought, what was I drinking
last night? Furniture polish?

95
00:06:31,116 --> 00:06:33,070
Ianto. Time and a place.

96
00:06:33,364 --> 00:06:35,711
- He is funny, though.
- Gwen, come and see!

97
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:38,809
Rhys, I've got no idea,
just stay indoors.

98
00:06:38,909 --> 00:06:41,047
Can you phone my mother,
tell her, erm,

99
00:06:41,506 --> 00:06:44,128
oh, I dunno, just tell her to
take her pills and go to sleep.

100
00:06:46,143 --> 00:06:47,788
I'll come home as soon as I can,

101
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,534
I promise.

102
00:06:50,591 --> 00:06:52,537
I love you, you big idiot.

103
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:55,591
<i>Someone's established an artificial
atmospheric shell.</i>

104
00:06:55,691 --> 00:06:57,324
<i>Keeping the air and holding the heat.</i>

105
00:06:57,424 --> 00:07:00,202
Whoever's done this wants
the Human Race alive. That's a plus.

106
00:07:01,748 --> 00:07:03,852
<i>27 planets, including the Earth.</i>

107
00:07:06,611 --> 00:07:07,956
No, but what's that?

108
00:07:09,289 --> 00:07:10,565
That's not a planet...

109
00:07:11,053 --> 00:07:13,623
<i>The reading seems to be
artificial in construction.</i>

110
00:07:13,723 --> 00:07:16,907
Some sort of space station.
Sitting at the heart of the web.

111
00:07:17,239 --> 00:07:19,710
They're fine... Maria and her dad,
they're in Cornwall.

112
00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:22,376
I told them to stay indoors.
Clyde's OK, he's with his mum.

113
00:07:22,595 --> 00:07:23,594
Sarah Jane,

114
00:07:23,694 --> 00:07:26,590
I have detected movement.
Observe.

115
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:28,205
Spaceships!

116
00:07:30,595 --> 00:07:32,372
Tracking 200 objects.

117
00:07:32,472 --> 00:07:34,204
Earthbound trajectory!

118
00:07:34,304 --> 00:07:38,708
Geneva is calling a Code Red.
Everyone to battle positions!

119
00:07:38,996 --> 00:07:41,599
Dr Jones, if you're not too busy.

120
00:07:41,699 --> 00:07:43,176
I'm trying to phone the Doctor, sir.

121
00:07:43,276 --> 00:07:44,075
And?

122
00:07:44,439 --> 00:07:45,702
There's no signal!

123
00:07:45,952 --> 00:07:48,980
This number calls anywhere
in the universe, it never breaks down.

124
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,438
They must be blocking it.

125
00:07:51,101 --> 00:07:52,490
Whoever 'they' are.

126
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:54,383
We're about to find out.

127
00:07:55,096 --> 00:07:56,430
They're coming into orbit.

128
00:08:18,678 --> 00:08:20,270
The end of the world, darlin'!

129
00:08:20,610 --> 00:08:22,376
End of the stinkin' world!

130
00:08:22,739 --> 00:08:24,046
Have one on me, mate.

131
00:08:36,356 --> 00:08:38,060
Right, you two.

132
00:08:38,272 --> 00:08:41,570
You can put that stuff down,
or run for your lives.

133
00:08:42,471 --> 00:08:43,728
D'you like my gun?

134
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:52,723
We're now getting confirmed
reports of spaceships.

135
00:08:52,823 --> 00:08:55,232
The Pentagon has issued
an emergency report.

136
00:08:55,426 --> 00:08:57,659
Dad, come and see!

137
00:08:58,350 --> 00:08:59,814
They're saying spaceships!

138
00:09:00,578 --> 00:09:03,862
- Did you find her?
- No, no, there's no reply.

139
00:09:05,095 --> 00:09:06,571
Where are you, Donna?

140
00:09:08,367 --> 00:09:10,087
Where are you, sweetheart?

141
00:09:10,838 --> 00:09:12,415
<i>3,000 miles and closing...</i>

142
00:09:12,684 --> 00:09:13,923
But who are they?!

143
00:09:17,195 --> 00:09:20,776
Martha Jones! Voice of a nightingale!
Tell me you put something in my drink.

144
00:09:20,876 --> 00:09:23,084
No such luck,
have you heard from the Doctor?

145
00:09:23,184 --> 00:09:24,022
<i>Not a word.</i>

146
00:09:24,122 --> 00:09:25,605
- Where are you?
- New York.

147
00:09:25,993 --> 00:09:28,055
- Nice for some.
- I've been promoted.

148
00:09:28,155 --> 00:09:31,346
- Medical Director on Project Indigo.
- D'you get that thing working?

149
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:35,512
Indigo's top secret,
no-one's supposed to know about it.

150
00:09:35,713 --> 00:09:38,870
- I met a soldier in a bar, long story.
- When was that?

151
00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:41,234
- Strictly professional!
- 1,500 miles, boys,

152
00:09:41,535 --> 00:09:43,681
and accelerating.
They're almost here.

153
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:47,523
<i>I'm receiving a communication
from the Earthbound ships.</i>

154
00:09:47,623 --> 00:09:49,733
<i>They have a message for the human race.</i>

155
00:09:49,833 --> 00:09:51,573
Put it through, let's hear it.

156
00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:55,510
<i>Exterminate! Exterminate!</i>

157
00:09:55,838 --> 00:09:59,548
<i>Exterminate! EXTERMINATE!</i>

158
00:09:59,829 --> 00:10:02,655
<i>Exterminate! Exterminate...</i>

159
00:10:02,849 --> 00:10:03,625
No...

160
00:10:03,725 --> 00:10:05,230
<i>EXTERMINATE!</i>

161
00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:07,047
<i>Exterminate!</i>

162
00:10:07,317 --> 00:10:09,125
- Oh, no.
- What is it?

163
00:10:09,225 --> 00:10:11,019
Who are they?
D'you know them? Jack?

164
00:10:11,119 --> 00:10:15,060
<i>Exterminate, exterminate,</i>

165
00:10:15,692 --> 00:10:19,384
<i>exterminate, exterminate...</i>

166
00:10:20,586 --> 00:10:21,190
No.

167
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,220
There's nothing I can do.

168
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:27,005
I'm sorry. We're dead.

169
00:10:27,105 --> 00:10:29,420
<i>Exterminate, exterminate...</i>

170
00:10:29,583 --> 00:10:31,807
Not Luke. You're so young.

171
00:10:31,907 --> 00:10:35,150
Exterminate, exterminate...

172
00:11:06,932 --> 00:11:09,750
Dalek fleet in battle formation!

173
00:11:10,335 --> 00:11:16,076
- All systems locked and primed!
- Crucible at 90% efficiency!

174
00:11:16,176 --> 00:11:19,129
The Human Harvest will commence!

175
00:11:20,693 --> 00:11:22,021
Battle stations!

176
00:11:22,309 --> 00:11:24,736
Geneva declaring Ultimate Code Red!

177
00:11:25,293 --> 00:11:27,790
Ladies and gentlemen, we are at war!

178
00:11:46,549 --> 00:11:49,310
Supreme Dalek on the Bridge!

179
00:11:52,061 --> 00:11:55,218
Soon, the Crucible will be complete!

180
00:11:55,681 --> 00:11:59,677
We have waited long for this
ultimate destiny.

181
00:11:59,946 --> 00:12:03,830
Now the Daleks are
the masters of Earth!

182
00:12:04,784 --> 00:12:07,606
Daleks are the masters of Earth!

183
00:12:08,269 --> 00:12:11,150
Daleks are the masters of Earth!

184
00:12:15,009 --> 00:12:18,577
So go on then, what is
the Shadow Proclamation anyway?

185
00:12:18,677 --> 00:12:21,855
Posh name for police.
Outer space police. Here we go!

186
00:12:41,173 --> 00:12:44,908
Sco bo tro no flo jo ko fo. To to!

187
00:12:45,008 --> 00:12:49,746
No bo ho sho ko ro to so.
Bo-ko-do-zo-go-bo-fo-po-jo!

188
00:12:54,213 --> 00:12:54,987
Mo ho.

189
00:12:55,688 --> 00:12:57,984
Time Lords are the stuff of legend.

190
00:12:58,653 --> 00:13:01,870
They belong in the myths and
whispers of the Higher Species. You,

191
00:13:02,245 --> 00:13:04,021
cannot possibly exist.

192
00:13:04,334 --> 00:13:07,294
Yeah, more to the point,
I've got a missing planet!

193
00:13:07,394 --> 00:13:10,172
Then you're not as wise
as the stories would say.

194
00:13:10,272 --> 00:13:12,049
<i>The picture is far bigger
than you imagine.</i>

195
00:13:12,149 --> 00:13:14,797
The whole universe
is in outrage, Doctor.

196
00:13:14,897 --> 00:13:18,989
<i>24 worlds have been
taken from the sky.</i>

197
00:13:19,164 --> 00:13:19,984
How many?!

198
00:13:20,666 --> 00:13:22,456
Which ones?! Show me!

199
00:13:24,209 --> 00:13:25,929
Locations range far and wide.

200
00:13:26,330 --> 00:13:29,402
<i>But all disappeared at the exact
same moment. Leaving no trace.</i>

201
00:13:29,502 --> 00:13:31,359
<i>Callufrax Minor. Jahoo.</i>

202
00:13:31,459 --> 00:13:33,570
Shallacatop. Woman Wept...

203
00:13:33,827 --> 00:13:35,835
Clom! Clom's gone!
Who'd want Clom?!

204
00:13:35,935 --> 00:13:37,345
All different sizes,

205
00:13:38,152 --> 00:13:39,560
some populated, some not.

206
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:41,325
But all unconnected.

207
00:13:41,531 --> 00:13:42,732
What about Pyrovillia?

208
00:13:42,832 --> 00:13:44,761
Who is the female?

209
00:13:45,042 --> 00:13:47,294
Donna! I'm a Human Being,

210
00:13:47,941 --> 00:13:49,315
<i>maybe not the stuff of legend</i>

211
00:13:49,415 --> 00:13:51,593
but every bit as important
as Time Lords, thank you.

212
00:13:52,326 --> 00:13:54,060
Way back when we were in Pompeii,

213
00:13:54,329 --> 00:13:56,143
Lucius said Pyrovillia had gone missing.

214
00:13:56,375 --> 00:13:59,459
Pyrovillia is cold case.
Not relevant!

215
00:13:59,559 --> 00:14:01,017
How d'you mean, cold case?

216
00:14:01,117 --> 00:14:03,404
The planet Pyrovillia
can't be part of this,

217
00:14:03,504 --> 00:14:05,193
it disappeared over 2,000 years ago.

218
00:14:05,293 --> 00:14:06,526
Yes, yes, hang on.

219
00:14:06,626 --> 00:14:08,503
<i>But there's the Adipose
Breeding Planet too,</i>

220
00:14:09,097 --> 00:14:10,681
Miss Foster said that was lost,

221
00:14:11,106 --> 00:14:12,990
but that must've been a long time ago.

222
00:14:13,509 --> 00:14:15,780
That's it! Donna! Brilliant!

223
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:18,390
Planets are being taken
out of time as well as space...

224
00:14:19,178 --> 00:14:20,710
Let's put this into 3-D...

225
00:14:21,863 --> 00:14:25,254
<i>Now, if we add Pyrovillia...</i>

226
00:14:27,644 --> 00:14:29,239
And Adipose 3.

227
00:14:31,965 --> 00:14:35,550
Something missing. Where else,
where else? Lost, lost, lost... Oh!

228
00:14:35,763 --> 00:14:37,590
The Lost Moon of Poosh!

229
00:14:45,129 --> 00:14:46,999
- What did you do?
- Nothing.

230
00:14:48,326 --> 00:14:51,230
The planets rearranged themselves
into the optimum pattern.

231
00:14:52,718 --> 00:14:53,953
Oh, look at that!

232
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:59,246
27 planets in perfect balance.
Come on, that is gorgeous!

233
00:14:59,415 --> 00:15:01,870
Oi, don't get all spaceman,
what does it mean?

234
00:15:02,362 --> 00:15:05,424
All those worlds fit together
like pieces of an engine.

235
00:15:06,299 --> 00:15:07,500
It's like a powerhouse!

236
00:15:08,776 --> 00:15:11,360
- What for?
- Who could design such a thing?

237
00:15:12,036 --> 00:15:14,340
Someone tried to move
the Earth once before.

238
00:15:15,597 --> 00:15:16,905
Long time ago...

239
00:15:19,329 --> 00:15:20,443
can't be...

240
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:24,249
<i>Maximum extermination!</i>

241
00:15:27,195 --> 00:15:30,061
<i>The shields are down!
There's so many, abandon ship. </i>

242
00:15:30,161 --> 00:15:31,237
The Valiant's down.

243
00:15:31,337 --> 00:15:34,258
Airforce retreating over North Africa!
Daleks landing in Japan.

244
00:15:34,358 --> 00:15:37,724
<i>We've lost contact with the Prime
Minister's plane... Jack! Manhattan!</i>

245
00:15:38,356 --> 00:15:41,246
- Martha, get out of there !
- I can't Jack, I've got a job to do.

246
00:15:41,346 --> 00:15:44,108
They're targeting military bases,
you're next on the list!

247
00:15:44,208 --> 00:15:46,841
Dr Jones, you will come with me.

248
00:15:46,941 --> 00:15:48,999
Project Indigo is being activated.

249
00:15:50,188 --> 00:15:51,158
Quick march!

250
00:15:53,777 --> 00:15:55,748
But we can't use Project Indigo,

251
00:15:55,848 --> 00:15:58,670
it hasn't been tested,
sir, we don't even know if it works.

252
00:16:00,231 --> 00:16:03,496
<i>Unit forces will be exterminated.</i>

253
00:16:03,596 --> 00:16:05,460
<i>Annihilate Unit.</i>

254
00:16:12,170 --> 00:16:14,310
Exterminate!

255
00:16:22,126 --> 00:16:24,310
Put it on, fast as you can.

256
00:16:26,174 --> 00:16:29,878
Martha, I'm telling you,
don't use Project Indigo, it's not safe.

257
00:16:29,978 --> 00:16:33,127
You take your orders from UNIT,
Dr Jones, not from Torchwood.

258
00:16:33,483 --> 00:16:34,165
But why me?

259
00:16:34,265 --> 00:16:36,111
You're our only hope
of finding the Doctor.

260
00:16:36,418 --> 00:16:37,563
<i>But failing that,</i>

261
00:16:37,819 --> 00:16:39,421
if no help is coming,

262
00:16:39,596 --> 00:16:41,191
then with the power invested in me

263
00:16:41,291 --> 00:16:43,568
<i>by the Unified Intelligence Taskforce,</i>

264
00:16:43,668 --> 00:16:45,733
I authorise you, to take this:

265
00:16:46,828 --> 00:16:48,098
<i>The Osterhagen Key.</i>

266
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:51,310
I can't take that, sir.

267
00:16:51,570 --> 00:16:53,139
You know what to do.

268
00:16:53,452 --> 00:16:55,492
For the sake of the Human Race.

269
00:16:58,839 --> 00:17:02,409
<i>Daleks one five
reaching north corridor.</i>

270
00:17:02,509 --> 00:17:05,590
- Dr Jones... good luck.
- Exterminate, exterminate...

271
00:17:13,786 --> 00:17:15,212
Exterminate...

272
00:17:15,312 --> 00:17:16,107
Bye, Jack.

273
00:17:16,207 --> 00:17:17,270
Martha, don't do it!

274
00:17:20,690 --> 00:17:21,585
DON'T!!!!

275
00:17:24,776 --> 00:17:26,159
What's Project Indigo?

276
00:17:28,499 --> 00:17:29,764
Experimental teleport.

277
00:17:29,864 --> 00:17:31,673
Salvaged from the Sontarans.

278
00:17:32,298 --> 00:17:34,813
But they haven't got coordinates,
or stabilisation.

279
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:35,890
So where is she?

280
00:17:37,085 --> 00:17:38,369
Scattered into atoms.

281
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:41,572
Martha's down.

282
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:45,164
Commence the landings.

283
00:17:45,264 --> 00:17:47,425
Bring the Humans here!

284
00:17:47,525 --> 00:17:51,190
- Prepare the Crucible!
- Supreme Dalek,

285
00:17:51,447 --> 00:17:52,586
<i>is there news?</i>

286
00:17:52,686 --> 00:17:54,990
Earth has been subjugated!

287
00:17:55,985 --> 00:17:59,557
I mean, is there news of him?

288
00:17:59,726 --> 00:18:03,350
<i>Negative! No reports of Time Lord.</i>

289
00:18:03,610 --> 00:18:06,378
We are beyond the Doctor's reach!

290
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:12,037
Fascinating. If I had not elevated
you beyond crude emotions,

291
00:18:12,137 --> 00:18:15,750
<i>I could almost mistake
that tone for one of victory.</i>

292
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:18,318
Beware your pride.

293
00:18:18,418 --> 00:18:20,639
The Doctor cannot stop us!

294
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:25,281
And yet, Dalek Caan is uneasy.

295
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:31,155
The Abomination is insane.

296
00:18:31,255 --> 00:18:32,463
Show respect.

297
00:18:32,701 --> 00:18:35,841
Without Dalek Caan,
none of this would be possible.

298
00:18:36,430 --> 00:18:38,660
<i>And he speaks only the truth.</i>

299
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:41,083
He is coming.

300
00:18:41,390 --> 00:18:47,150
The threefold man, he dances
in the lonely places.

301
00:18:47,517 --> 00:18:50,207
<i>Oh, creator of us all.</i>

302
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:53,313
The Doctor is coming...

303
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:20,910
<i>You need sustenance.</i>

304
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:23,521
Take the water. It purifies.

305
00:19:24,448 --> 00:19:25,104
Thanks.

306
00:19:26,061 --> 00:19:27,638
There was something on your back.

307
00:19:29,802 --> 00:19:30,697
How d'you know that?

308
00:19:31,517 --> 00:19:33,039
You are something new.

309
00:19:33,972 --> 00:19:34,780
Not me.

310
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:37,151
<i>I'm just a temp.</i>

311
00:19:37,789 --> 00:19:40,179
Shorthand, filing,
100 words per minute,

312
00:19:41,230 --> 00:19:42,708
fat lot of good that is now.

313
00:19:43,521 --> 00:19:44,573
I'm no use to anyone.

314
00:19:45,050 --> 00:19:46,775
I'm so sorry for your loss.

315
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:49,035
Yeah.

316
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,550
My whole planet's gone.

317
00:19:53,221 --> 00:19:55,361
I mean the loss that is yet to come.

318
00:19:58,276 --> 00:19:59,215
God save you.

319
00:20:02,481 --> 00:20:04,821
Come on, think, Earth!
Must've been some sort of warning.

320
00:20:04,921 --> 00:20:06,880
Was there anything happening, like,

321
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:10,045
electrical storms, freak weather,
patterns in the sky?

322
00:20:10,145 --> 00:20:11,434
Well, how should I know?

323
00:20:12,185 --> 00:20:13,533
Um... no,

324
00:20:14,334 --> 00:20:15,373
I don't think so, no.

325
00:20:16,255 --> 00:20:18,350
- OK, never mind.
- Although...

326
00:20:20,478 --> 00:20:21,811
there were the bees disappearing.

327
00:20:22,624 --> 00:20:23,790
The bees disappearing...

328
00:20:25,010 --> 00:20:26,605
<i>The bees disappearing.</i>

329
00:20:27,613 --> 00:20:30,960
The bees disappearing.
How is that significant?

330
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:32,737
On Earth we have these insects.

331
00:20:32,837 --> 00:20:35,130
Some people said it was pollution,
or mobile phone...

332
00:20:35,299 --> 00:20:36,456
Or, they were going home!

333
00:20:36,869 --> 00:20:39,366
- Back home where?
- The planet Melissa Majoria!

334
00:20:39,785 --> 00:20:43,583
- Are you saying bees are aliens?!
- Don't be so daft. Not all of them.

335
00:20:43,683 --> 00:20:46,246
But if the migrant bees felt something
coming, and escaped...

336
00:20:46,346 --> 00:20:47,272
Tandocca!

337
00:20:47,372 --> 00:20:48,717
The Tandocca Scale!

338
00:20:48,817 --> 00:20:52,083
It's wavelengths used as
a carrier signal. Infinitely small!

339
00:20:52,183 --> 00:20:55,170
It's like looking for a speck
of cinnamon in the Sahara, but look,

340
00:20:55,270 --> 00:20:57,327
There it is. The Tandocca trail.

341
00:20:58,285 --> 00:21:01,501
The transmat that moved the planets used
the same wavelength, we can follow it!

342
00:21:01,601 --> 00:21:03,431
Find the Earth?!
Stop talking and do it!

343
00:21:03,531 --> 00:21:04,345
I am!

344
00:21:07,617 --> 00:21:08,574
We're a bit late.

345
00:21:10,730 --> 00:21:12,716
The signal's scattered.
But it's a start!

346
00:21:15,383 --> 00:21:17,535
I've got a blip! Just a blip!
But definitely a blip!

347
00:21:17,635 --> 00:21:19,925
According to the Strictures
of the Shadow Proclamation,

348
00:21:20,025 --> 00:21:22,841
I will have to seize your
transport and your technology.

349
00:21:22,941 --> 00:21:24,270
Oh, really, what for?

350
00:21:24,552 --> 00:21:26,948
The planets were stolen
with hostile intent.

351
00:21:27,048 --> 00:21:29,945
We are declaring war, Doctor.
Right across the universe.

352
00:21:30,045 --> 00:21:32,685
And you will lead us into battle!

353
00:21:33,542 --> 00:21:35,423
Right, yes,

354
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:38,201
course I will.

355
00:21:39,108 --> 00:21:40,673
I'll just go and...

356
00:21:42,136 --> 00:21:43,163
get you the key.

357
00:21:50,930 --> 00:21:52,433
Doctor! Come back!

358
00:21:54,930 --> 00:21:57,510
By the Holy Writ
of the Shadow Proclamation,

359
00:21:57,610 --> 00:22:00,287
I order you to stop!

360
00:22:00,387 --> 00:22:03,630
All Humans will leave their homes!

361
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:07,203
The males, the females,

362
00:22:07,303 --> 00:22:10,790
the descendants, you will come with us!

363
00:22:11,050 --> 00:22:13,030
Resistance is useless!

364
00:22:13,347 --> 00:22:17,903
- Where are you taking us?
- Daleks do not answer Human questions!

365
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:21,553
- Stand in line!
- Dad, please come home.

366
00:22:21,653 --> 00:22:24,264
- They're leaving our street alone.
- Yeah, I've got a weapon!

367
00:22:24,364 --> 00:22:26,516
- It's a paint gun!
- Exactly!

368
00:22:27,048 --> 00:22:29,813
Them Dalek things,
they've only got one eye...

369
00:22:30,151 --> 00:22:32,502
Good splodge of paint,
they'd be blinded!

370
00:22:32,602 --> 00:22:34,964
We're not going! D'you hear me?

371
00:22:35,627 --> 00:22:37,823
Laura, get back inside the house!

372
00:22:37,986 --> 00:22:39,669
Simon! Get inside! Go!

373
00:22:42,983 --> 00:22:44,447
Get back in the sky,

374
00:22:45,204 --> 00:22:47,751
<i>get back where you came from,
and leave us alone!</i>

375
00:22:49,377 --> 00:22:52,154
Dalek attack formation seven.

376
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:58,837
Maximum extermination!

377
00:23:05,803 --> 00:23:07,924
- They're monsters.
- Please, Dad.

378
00:23:08,024 --> 00:23:09,258
Come home.

379
00:23:13,031 --> 00:23:17,150
- Halt! You will come with me!
- Will I heck!

380
00:23:21,589 --> 00:23:24,442
My vision is NOT impaired!

381
00:23:24,542 --> 00:23:28,353
- I warned you, Dad!
- Hostility will not be tolerated!

382
00:23:28,453 --> 00:23:31,184
Exterminate! Exterminate! Exter...

383
00:23:40,550 --> 00:23:44,160
- Do you want to swap?
- You're Donna Noble's family, right?

384
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:46,625
I'm Rose Tyler. And I need you.

385
00:23:48,727 --> 00:23:50,929
I've tried calling her,
but I can't get through!

386
00:23:51,029 --> 00:23:53,551
But she's still with the Doctor,
I know that much...

387
00:23:53,754 --> 00:23:55,750
and the last time she phoned,

388
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:58,710
it was from a planet called Midnight,
made of diamonds!

389
00:23:58,810 --> 00:24:00,657
What the hell are you two on about?

390
00:24:00,757 --> 00:24:02,509
Look, she's out there, sweetheart.

391
00:24:02,828 --> 00:24:04,110
Your daughter.

392
00:24:04,567 --> 00:24:08,190
She's travelling the stars,
with that Doctor, she always has been!

393
00:24:08,290 --> 00:24:10,852
- Don't be ridiculous.
- Oh, come on open your eyes!

394
00:24:10,952 --> 00:24:13,411
Look at the sky! Look at the Daleks!

395
00:24:13,511 --> 00:24:16,108
You can't start denying things now!

396
00:24:16,308 --> 00:24:19,094
You were my last hope.
If we can't find Donna,

397
00:24:19,845 --> 00:24:21,215
<i>then we can't find the Doctor...</i>

398
00:24:24,575 --> 00:24:25,910
Where is he?!

399
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:37,106
It's stopped.

400
00:24:37,906 --> 00:24:38,770
What d'you mean?

401
00:24:40,253 --> 00:24:41,341
Is that good or bad?

402
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:43,074
Where are we?

403
00:24:43,650 --> 00:24:45,290
The Medusa Cascade.

404
00:24:55,712 --> 00:24:57,345
I came here when I was just a kid.

405
00:24:58,215 --> 00:24:59,422
90 years old.

406
00:25:00,811 --> 00:25:03,502
<i>It was the centre of
a rift in time and space...</i>

407
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:05,103
<i>So...</i>

408
00:25:06,269 --> 00:25:07,830
where are the 27 planets?

409
00:25:08,283 --> 00:25:09,115
Nowhere.

410
00:25:10,454 --> 00:25:12,106
The Tandocca Trail stops dead.

411
00:25:15,904 --> 00:25:16,995
End of the line.

412
00:25:18,547 --> 00:25:19,773
So what do we do?

413
00:25:22,038 --> 00:25:23,796
Doctor? What do we do?

414
00:25:26,090 --> 00:25:27,729
<i>Now don't do this to me.</i>

415
00:25:30,670 --> 00:25:31,746
No, don't,

416
00:25:32,741 --> 00:25:33,750
don't do this to me.

417
00:25:35,212 --> 00:25:36,069
<i>Not now.</i>

418
00:25:37,189 --> 00:25:39,387
Tell me, what are we going do?

419
00:25:42,402 --> 00:25:43,591
You never give up.

420
00:25:45,781 --> 00:25:46,625
Please.

421
00:25:53,756 --> 00:25:56,709
<i>This is the Commander General
of the United Nations</i>

422
00:25:56,972 --> 00:25:58,674
<i>calling the Dalek Fleet.</i>

423
00:25:59,324 --> 00:26:02,614
<i>We surrender, repeat, we surrender.</i>

424
00:26:03,298 --> 00:26:05,230
<i>Planet Earth surrenders.</i>

425
00:26:05,551 --> 00:26:10,790
<i>Humans selected for testing
will follow Dalek instruction...</i>

426
00:26:11,633 --> 00:26:14,085
<i>The Daleks reign supreme.</i>

427
00:26:14,273 --> 00:26:16,569
<i>All hail the Daleks.</i>

428
00:26:17,470 --> 00:26:21,490
<i>You will obey Dalek
instructions without question.</i>

429
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:24,588
<i>You will obey your Dalek Ma...</i>

430
00:26:31,130 --> 00:26:32,442
<i>Can anyone hear me?</i>

431
00:26:33,678 --> 00:26:35,605
<i>The Subwave Network is open.</i>

432
00:26:35,705 --> 00:26:37,532
<i>You should be able to hear my voice.</i>

433
00:26:39,453 --> 00:26:41,030
<i>Is there anyone there?</i>

434
00:26:41,407 --> 00:26:42,950
I know that voice.

435
00:26:43,690 --> 00:26:46,393
- Who's that?
- Some poor soul calling for help.

436
00:26:46,850 --> 00:26:48,710
- Can anyone...
- There's nothing we can do.

437
00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:50,015
But look at Mr Smith.

438
00:26:50,115 --> 00:26:52,724
<i>Processing incoming soundwave.</i>

439
00:26:52,956 --> 00:26:55,490
<i>This message is of
the utmost importance.</i>

440
00:26:55,590 --> 00:26:56,750
<i>We haven't much time...</i>

441
00:26:58,434 --> 00:26:59,517
<i>Can anyone hear me?</i>

442
00:27:01,093 --> 00:27:02,526
Someone's trying to get in touch.

443
00:27:03,896 --> 00:27:06,110
The whole world's crying out.
Just leave it.

444
00:27:06,518 --> 00:27:09,190
<i>Captain Jack Harkness,
shame on you!</i>

445
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:11,710
<i>Now stand to attention, sir!</i>

446
00:27:12,622 --> 00:27:13,360
What?!

447
00:27:14,399 --> 00:27:15,373
Who is that?

448
00:27:17,618 --> 00:27:20,234
Harriet Jones,
former Prime Minister.

449
00:27:20,553 --> 00:27:22,273
Yeah, I know who you are.

450
00:27:22,530 --> 00:27:26,210
Harriet! It's me, it's me.
Oh, she can't hear me...

451
00:27:26,310 --> 00:27:27,269
Have you got a webcam?

452
00:27:27,369 --> 00:27:29,430
She wouldn't let me,
said they're naughty.

453
00:27:30,865 --> 00:27:33,400
- I can't speak to her then, can I?
- Sarah Jane Smith,

454
00:27:33,699 --> 00:27:38,630
- 13 Bannerman Road... are you there?
- Yeah. I'm here! That's me!

455
00:27:38,890 --> 00:27:42,110
Good... Now, let's see
if we can talk to each other.

456
00:27:46,393 --> 00:27:49,075
The fourth contact is having
some trouble getting through.

457
00:27:49,175 --> 00:27:51,106
That's me! Harriet! That's me!

458
00:27:51,387 --> 00:27:53,026
I'll just boost the signal...

459
00:27:54,071 --> 00:27:54,870
Hello?

460
00:27:56,117 --> 00:27:57,278
Martha Jones!

461
00:27:57,547 --> 00:27:59,224
Who's she? I want to get through!

462
00:27:59,324 --> 00:28:00,263
Martha, where are you?!

463
00:28:00,363 --> 00:28:02,703
I guess Project Indigo
was more clever than we thought.

464
00:28:02,803 --> 00:28:04,605
One second I was in Manhattan...

465
00:28:06,006 --> 00:28:08,912
<i>Next second...
Maybe Indigo tapped into my mind.</i>

466
00:28:09,012 --> 00:28:11,634
<i>Cos I ended up in the
one place that I wanted to be.</i>

467
00:28:14,724 --> 00:28:15,256
Mum!

468
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,225
<i>You came home..</i>

469
00:28:20,688 --> 00:28:22,950
At the end of the world,
you came back to me.

470
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:28,130
But then all of a sudden,
it's like the laptop turned itself on.

471
00:28:28,230 --> 00:28:30,494
It did. That was me.

472
00:28:31,607 --> 00:28:33,453
Harriet Jones,
former Prime Minister.

473
00:28:33,553 --> 00:28:35,496
Yes, I know who you are.

474
00:28:35,596 --> 00:28:38,871
<i>I thought it was about time we all met.
Given the current crisis.</i>

475
00:28:38,971 --> 00:28:41,537
<i>Torchwood, this is Sarah Jane Smith.</i>

476
00:28:41,781 --> 00:28:43,288
I've been following your work.

477
00:28:43,639 --> 00:28:45,145
Nice job with the Slitheen.

478
00:28:45,489 --> 00:28:47,641
Yeah, well I've been
staying away from you lot.

479
00:28:47,848 --> 00:28:49,049
Too many guns!

480
00:28:49,550 --> 00:28:50,701
All the same,

481
00:28:51,339 --> 00:28:53,034
might I say, looking good, ma'am.

482
00:28:53,547 --> 00:28:54,894
Really? Oh.

483
00:28:55,245 --> 00:28:56,577
Not now, Captain.

484
00:28:57,159 --> 00:29:00,338
And Martha Jones,
former companion to the Doctor.

485
00:29:00,738 --> 00:29:01,845
Oi! So was I!!

486
00:29:01,945 --> 00:29:03,578
But how did you find me?

487
00:29:04,079 --> 00:29:07,251
<i>This, ladies and gentlemen,
this is the Subwave Network.</i>

488
00:29:07,507 --> 00:29:11,330
A sentient piece of software, programmed
to seek out anyone at everyone

489
00:29:11,549 --> 00:29:13,295
who can help to contact the Doctor.

490
00:29:13,395 --> 00:29:14,959
What if the Daleks can hear us?

491
00:29:15,059 --> 00:29:19,310
No, that's the beauty of the Subwave,
it's undetectable.

492
00:29:19,509 --> 00:29:21,292
And you invented it?

493
00:29:21,392 --> 00:29:25,046
I developed it. It was created
by the Mr Copper Foundation.

494
00:29:25,146 --> 00:29:27,285
<i>Yeah, but what we need, is a weapon!</i>

495
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:29,869
Martha, back there at UNIT,
what did they give you,

496
00:29:29,969 --> 00:29:31,208
<i>what was that key thing?</i>

497
00:29:32,453 --> 00:29:33,630
The Osterhagen Key.

498
00:29:33,890 --> 00:29:38,042
That key is not to be used, Dr Jones.
Not under any circumstances.

499
00:29:38,909 --> 00:29:40,630
But what is an Osterhagen Key?

500
00:29:40,811 --> 00:29:42,932
Forget about the key
and that's an order.

501
00:29:43,652 --> 00:29:45,383
<i>All we need is the Doctor.</i>

502
00:29:45,708 --> 00:29:49,043
Excuse me, Harriet, but,
if you're looking for the Doctor...

503
00:29:49,143 --> 00:29:51,414
- didn't he depose you?
- He did.

504
00:29:51,882 --> 00:29:54,741
And I've wondering about that for
a long time. Whether I was wrong,

505
00:29:55,292 --> 00:29:57,377
but I stand by my actions, to this day.

506
00:29:57,477 --> 00:29:59,523
Because I knew, I knew that one day,

507
00:29:59,921 --> 00:30:03,590
<i>the Earth would be in danger,
and the Doctor would fail to appear.</i>

508
00:30:04,419 --> 00:30:05,760
I told him so myself.

509
00:30:05,860 --> 00:30:06,950
And he didn't listen.

510
00:30:07,050 --> 00:30:08,413
But I've been trying to find him,

511
00:30:08,513 --> 00:30:11,016
he got my phone, on the TARDIS,
but I can't get through.

512
00:30:11,116 --> 00:30:12,922
Nor me, and I was here first!

513
00:30:13,022 --> 00:30:14,671
That's why we need the Subwave.

514
00:30:15,132 --> 00:30:16,383
To bring us all together,

515
00:30:16,483 --> 00:30:19,755
combine forces.
The Doctor's secret army.

516
00:30:20,813 --> 00:30:21,676
Wait a minute...

517
00:30:22,114 --> 00:30:23,634
we boost the signal! That's it!

518
00:30:24,191 --> 00:30:26,687
We transmit that telephone number
through Torchwood,

519
00:30:26,787 --> 00:30:28,350
using all the power of the Rift...

520
00:30:28,450 --> 00:30:29,830
And we've got Mr Smith!

521
00:30:30,203 --> 00:30:32,610
<i>He can link up with every
telephone exchange on the Earth!</i>

522
00:30:32,710 --> 00:30:35,243
<i>Can get the whole world to
call same number, at the same time!</i>

523
00:30:35,343 --> 00:30:37,202
Billions of phones,
calling out, all at once!

524
00:30:37,734 --> 00:30:39,742
Brilliant! Who's the kid?

525
00:30:40,405 --> 00:30:41,350
That's my son!

526
00:30:42,207 --> 00:30:43,364
But, excuse me, sorry,

527
00:30:43,758 --> 00:30:45,718
sorry, hello, Ianto Jones.

528
00:30:46,096 --> 00:30:47,442
If we start transmitting,

529
00:30:47,542 --> 00:30:50,441
then this Subwave Network
is going to become visible.

530
00:30:50,541 --> 00:30:51,999
I mean, to the Daleks.

531
00:30:52,099 --> 00:30:55,751
Yes, and they'll trace it back to me.
But my life doesn't matter.

532
00:30:56,070 --> 00:30:57,266
Not if it saves the Earth.

533
00:30:58,736 --> 00:31:00,630
- Ma'am.
- Thank you, Captain.

534
00:31:01,622 --> 00:31:04,281
But there are people out there dying,
on the streets.

535
00:31:04,719 --> 00:31:06,633
Marvellous woman. I voted for her.

536
00:31:06,896 --> 00:31:07,950
You did not.

537
00:31:08,272 --> 00:31:10,832
Now enough of words. Let's begin!

538
00:31:15,156 --> 00:31:16,452
Rift Power activated!

539
00:31:17,665 --> 00:31:19,186
All terminals coordinated!

540
00:31:28,505 --> 00:31:30,913
National grid online...
giving you everything we've got!

541
00:31:31,896 --> 00:31:33,185
Connecting you to Mr Smith!

542
00:31:33,285 --> 00:31:34,910
All telephone networks combined!

543
00:31:36,942 --> 00:31:38,870
Sending you the number... now!

544
00:31:39,601 --> 00:31:45,550
Opening Subwave Network to maximum.

545
00:31:45,735 --> 00:31:47,024
Mr Smith...

546
00:31:48,257 --> 00:31:51,470
- make that call!
- Calling the Doctor!

547
00:31:52,398 --> 00:31:53,630
So am I!

548
00:31:55,290 --> 00:31:58,251
A-a-a-and sending!

549
00:32:20,599 --> 00:32:22,043
- Phone!
- Phone!

550
00:32:23,364 --> 00:32:24,796
Martha, is that you?!

551
00:32:25,589 --> 00:32:26,359
It's the signal!

552
00:32:26,459 --> 00:32:29,224
- Can we follow it?
- Just watch me!

553
00:32:31,570 --> 00:32:35,825
Emergency! Unknown network detected!
Subwave frequency!

554
00:32:35,925 --> 00:32:40,347
Find the point of origin.
Find and exterminate!

555
00:32:40,447 --> 00:32:42,794
<i>I warned you, Supreme One...</i>

556
00:32:43,207 --> 00:32:45,830
Just as Dalek Caan foretold.

557
00:32:46,178 --> 00:32:49,435
The Children of Time
are moving against us.

558
00:32:49,714 --> 00:32:53,368
But everything is falling into place.

559
00:32:59,518 --> 00:33:01,340
I think we've got a fix!

560
00:33:01,610 --> 00:33:03,278
Mr Smith, now at 200%.

561
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:09,870
Oh, come on, Doctor!

562
00:33:20,442 --> 00:33:21,831
Find me, Doctor.

563
00:33:23,353 --> 00:33:24,492
Find me.

564
00:33:25,591 --> 00:33:27,631
Got it! Locking on!

565
00:33:34,009 --> 00:33:36,386
Harriet! A saucer's locked on
to your location,

566
00:33:36,768 --> 00:33:38,025
they've found you...

567
00:33:38,210 --> 00:33:41,579
I know. I'm using the Network
to mask your transmission. Keep going!

568
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:43,430
<i>Exterminate!</i>

569
00:33:49,654 --> 00:33:51,349
We're travelling through time.

570
00:33:53,330 --> 00:33:56,817
One second in the future!
The phone call's pulling us through!

571
00:33:59,494 --> 00:34:00,550
Captain,

572
00:34:01,208 --> 00:34:05,830
<i>I'm transferring the Subwave Network
to Torchwood, you're in charge now.</i>

573
00:34:06,526 --> 00:34:08,015
And tell the Doctor from me...

574
00:34:08,835 --> 00:34:10,578
<i>he chose his companions well.</i>

575
00:34:12,248 --> 00:34:13,287
It's been an honour.

576
00:34:22,592 --> 00:34:24,719
Harriet Jones.
Former Prime Minister.

577
00:34:24,819 --> 00:34:27,897
Yes, we know who you are.

578
00:34:29,049 --> 00:34:31,032
Oh, you know nothing of any Human.

579
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:33,109
And that will be your downfall.

580
00:34:35,174 --> 00:34:37,039
<i>Exterminate!</i>

581
00:34:47,130 --> 00:34:50,083
Three! Two! One!

582
00:35:06,374 --> 00:35:07,751
27 planets.

583
00:35:09,334 --> 00:35:10,310
And there's the Earth!

584
00:35:11,893 --> 00:35:13,270
<i>Why couldn't we see them?!</i>

585
00:35:13,904 --> 00:35:15,511
The entire Medusa Cascade

586
00:35:15,611 --> 00:35:18,427
has been put a second out of sync
with the rest of the universe.

587
00:35:18,527 --> 00:35:21,637
Perfect hiding place, tiny little pocket
of time. But we found them!

588
00:35:22,344 --> 00:35:24,907
Ooh, ooh, what's that?

589
00:35:25,789 --> 00:35:27,190
Hold on, hold on,

590
00:35:27,785 --> 00:35:29,630
some sort of Subwave Network...

591
00:35:32,383 --> 00:35:35,261
Where the hell have you been?!
Doctor, it's the Daleks!

592
00:35:35,361 --> 00:35:38,020
- He's nice I thought he'd be older.
- He's not that young.

593
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:40,348
<i>The Daleks are taking people
to their spaceship...</i>

594
00:35:40,761 --> 00:35:42,471
Look, Doctor, I've got a son!

595
00:35:42,571 --> 00:35:44,041
It's not just Dalek Caan!

596
00:35:44,141 --> 00:35:46,250
- That's Donna!
- That's my girl!

597
00:35:46,669 --> 00:35:48,630
Sarah Jane! Who's that boy?

598
00:35:49,253 --> 00:35:50,630
That must be Torchwood.

599
00:35:51,175 --> 00:35:52,310
Aren't they brilliant?

600
00:35:52,570 --> 00:35:54,576
<i>Look at you all, you clever people.</i>

601
00:35:54,877 --> 00:35:58,862
That's Martha. And who's... he?

602
00:35:59,299 --> 00:36:03,190
Captain Jack. Don't. Just... don't.

603
00:36:03,954 --> 00:36:05,249
Doctor, it's me,

604
00:36:06,306 --> 00:36:07,395
I came back.

605
00:36:08,483 --> 00:36:11,046
<i>It's like an outer space Facebook.</i>

606
00:36:11,405 --> 00:36:12,727
Everyone except Rose.

607
00:36:20,747 --> 00:36:22,414
He is here.

608
00:36:23,015 --> 00:36:25,734
The Dark Lord is come.

609
00:36:26,270 --> 00:36:28,517
Supreme One, this Subwave Network,

610
00:36:28,617 --> 00:36:30,669
I would address it, give me access.

611
00:36:33,738 --> 00:36:34,523
We've lost them!

612
00:36:34,623 --> 00:36:36,430
No, no, no, there's another signal.

613
00:36:36,530 --> 00:36:39,283
There's someone else out there.
Hello? Can you hear me?

614
00:36:39,713 --> 00:36:40,410
Rose?

615
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,274
<i>Your voice is different. And yet,</i>

616
00:36:45,315 --> 00:36:48,510
its arrogance is unchanged.

617
00:36:48,990 --> 00:36:49,456
No.

618
00:36:51,237 --> 00:36:52,339
But he's dead...

619
00:36:54,076 --> 00:36:57,694
Welcome to my new Empire, Doctor.

620
00:36:58,530 --> 00:37:02,382
It is only fitting that you should bear
witness to the resurrection,

621
00:37:02,482 --> 00:37:05,283
and the triumph, of Davros.

622
00:37:05,383 --> 00:37:09,808
Lord and Creator of the Dalek Race!

623
00:37:12,412 --> 00:37:15,112
- Doctor?
- Have you nothing to say?

624
00:37:16,853 --> 00:37:18,134
Doctor, it's all right.

625
00:37:19,100 --> 00:37:21,892
We're in the TARDIS. We're safe.

626
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:24,247
But you were destroyed.

627
00:37:25,555 --> 00:37:28,196
In the very first year of the Time War.
At the Gates of Elysium.

628
00:37:28,296 --> 00:37:31,280
<i>I saw your command ship fly into
the jaws of the Nightmare Child.</i>

629
00:37:31,812 --> 00:37:33,138
I tried to save you.

630
00:37:33,238 --> 00:37:35,447
But it took one stronger than you.

631
00:37:35,972 --> 00:37:38,030
Dalek Caan himself.

632
00:37:38,397 --> 00:37:41,888
I flew into the wild and fire,

633
00:37:42,010 --> 00:37:46,406
I danced and died a thousand times.

634
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:50,998
Emergency Temporal Shift took
him back into the Time War itself.

635
00:37:51,230 --> 00:37:53,413
That's impossible!
The entire war is timelocked!

636
00:37:53,513 --> 00:37:55,522
And yet he succeeded.

637
00:37:55,622 --> 00:37:58,702
Oh, it cost him his mind.
But imagine,

638
00:37:58,988 --> 00:38:02,986
a single, simple Dalek succeeded where

639
00:38:03,611 --> 00:38:06,470
Emperors and Time Lords have failed.

640
00:38:07,097 --> 00:38:11,790
A testament, don't you think,
to my remarkable creations?

641
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:14,367
And you made a new race of Daleks?

642
00:38:15,706 --> 00:38:17,466
I gave myself to them.

643
00:38:18,054 --> 00:38:19,475
Quite literally.

644
00:38:20,138 --> 00:38:24,692
Each one grown from a cell
of my own body.

645
00:38:27,679 --> 00:38:29,211
New Daleks.

646
00:38:29,486 --> 00:38:31,710
<i>True Daleks.</i>

647
00:38:32,283 --> 00:38:34,279
I have my children, Doctor.

648
00:38:35,511 --> 00:38:37,773
What do you have, now?

649
00:38:38,543 --> 00:38:39,744
After all this time.

650
00:38:40,332 --> 00:38:42,804
Everything we saw.
Everything we lost.

651
00:38:44,017 --> 00:38:46,630
I have only one thing to say to you...

652
00:38:47,093 --> 00:38:47,925
Bye!

653
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:52,999
Emergency!

654
00:38:53,099 --> 00:38:56,759
Locate the TARDIS! Find the Doctor!

655
00:38:56,940 --> 00:39:00,869
He will go to the Earth,
to find his precious Human allies!

656
00:39:01,140 --> 00:39:03,104
And death is coming.

657
00:39:03,354 --> 00:39:06,057
Oh, I can see it.

658
00:39:06,157 --> 00:39:11,824
Everlasting death for
the most faithful companion...

659
00:39:11,924 --> 00:39:16,047
Subwave Network rerouted.
New location : Torchwood!

660
00:39:16,147 --> 00:39:21,749
Then exterminate them, at once!
Exterminate Torchwood!

661
00:39:24,389 --> 00:39:25,303
Gwen,

662
00:39:26,366 --> 00:39:28,497
Dalek saucer heading for the Bay.
They've found us.

663
00:39:29,673 --> 00:39:31,270
<i>Martha, open that Indigo device...</i>

664
00:39:31,530 --> 00:39:34,922
Lift the central panel, there's
a string of numbers that change...

665
00:39:35,022 --> 00:39:38,685
<i>The fourth number oscillates between
two digits, tell me what they are.</i>

666
00:39:39,115 --> 00:39:41,912
It's a four, and a nine,
we could never work out what that was.

667
00:39:42,682 --> 00:39:44,152
That's the teleport base code.

668
00:39:44,477 --> 00:39:46,917
And that's all I need,
to get this thing working again!

669
00:39:48,062 --> 00:39:50,559
Oscillating four and nine...

670
00:39:51,466 --> 00:39:52,830
Thank you, Martha Jones!

671
00:39:55,130 --> 00:39:56,056
I've gotta go,

672
00:39:56,650 --> 00:39:57,895
I've gotta find the Doctor,

673
00:39:59,578 --> 00:40:00,617
I'll come back,

674
00:40:02,487 --> 00:40:03,476
I'm coming back.

675
00:40:03,638 --> 00:40:05,309
Don't worry about us! Just go!

676
00:40:05,985 --> 00:40:07,545
- We'll be fine!
- You'd better be.

677
00:40:24,375 --> 00:40:28,340
<i>Exterminate! Exterminate!</i>

678
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:29,507
They're here...

679
00:40:29,607 --> 00:40:31,578
TARDIS heading for Vector 7,

680
00:40:31,740 --> 00:40:34,179
- grid reference 665.
- But there are Daleks out there!

681
00:40:34,279 --> 00:40:38,572
I know, I'm sorry,
but I have got to find the Doctor...

682
00:40:39,344 --> 00:40:42,754
Don't move, don't leave the house,
don't do anything.

683
00:40:42,854 --> 00:40:45,118
<i>I will protect the boy,
Sarah Jane.</i>

684
00:40:46,247 --> 00:40:47,235
I love you.

685
00:40:47,886 --> 00:40:48,787
Remember that.

686
00:41:03,028 --> 00:41:04,543
Control? I need another shift.

687
00:41:04,643 --> 00:41:06,458
Lock me on to the TARDIS... now!

688
00:41:08,153 --> 00:41:10,318
Right, I'm gonna find them.

689
00:41:11,357 --> 00:41:12,270
Wish me luck!

690
00:41:12,585 --> 00:41:14,599
- Oh, good luck.
- Yeah, good luck, sweetheart!

691
00:41:27,217 --> 00:41:28,381
It's like a ghost town.

692
00:41:29,007 --> 00:41:32,191
<i>Sarah Jane said they were
taking the people. What for?</i>

693
00:41:32,291 --> 00:41:35,470
Think, Donna, when you met Rose in
that parallel world, what did she say?

694
00:41:36,034 --> 00:41:38,510
Just... the darkness is coming.

695
00:41:38,931 --> 00:41:39,913
Anything else?

696
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:45,550
Why don't you ask her yourself?

697
00:42:32,259 --> 00:42:34,198
Exterminate!

698
00:42:46,642 --> 00:42:48,501
I've got you, it missed you.

699
00:42:48,601 --> 00:42:49,871
Look, it's me.

700
00:42:50,736 --> 00:42:52,438
- Rose...
- Hi.

701
00:42:53,737 --> 00:42:55,495
- Long time no see...
- Yeah,

702
00:42:56,728 --> 00:42:58,039
been busy, y'know.

703
00:42:59,050 --> 00:43:01,340
Don't die, oh, my God, don't die.

704
00:43:02,660 --> 00:43:04,049
My god, don't die.

705
00:43:06,070 --> 00:43:08,430
Get him into the TARDIS,
quick. Move!

706
00:43:12,051 --> 00:43:15,104
- But they don't work against Daleks!
- Well, I'm going out fighting.

707
00:43:15,279 --> 00:43:17,157
Like Owen... Like Tosh.

708
00:43:18,721 --> 00:43:19,750
How about you?

709
00:43:22,926 --> 00:43:24,077
Yes, ma'am!

710
00:43:27,061 --> 00:43:28,675
<i>What. What do we do?!</i>

711
00:43:29,632 --> 00:43:31,522
There must be some medicine,
or something.

712
00:43:31,791 --> 00:43:33,705
Just step back. Rose!

713
00:43:34,062 --> 00:43:35,501
Do as I say, and get back!

714
00:43:35,745 --> 00:43:37,938
<i>He's dying and you know
what happens next.</i>

715
00:43:38,745 --> 00:43:39,702
What d'you mean?

716
00:43:41,235 --> 00:43:43,212
Oh, no, I came all this way.

717
00:43:43,431 --> 00:43:45,108
What d'you mean? What happens next?

718
00:43:51,378 --> 00:43:52,430
It's starting...

719
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:11,765
All Human transport is forbidden!

720
00:44:11,865 --> 00:44:16,107
- I surrender! I'm sorry!
- Daleks do not accept apologies!

721
00:44:16,207 --> 00:44:17,999
You will be exterminated!

722
00:44:18,174 --> 00:44:20,876
<i>Exterminate! Exterminate!</i>

723
00:44:27,346 --> 00:44:31,250
Exterminate. Exterminate.

724
00:44:35,799 --> 00:44:36,517
Here we go.

725
00:44:37,918 --> 00:44:39,026
Good luck, Doctor!

726
00:44:39,126 --> 00:44:43,209
- Will someone tell me what is going on!
- When he's dying, his body...

727
00:44:43,309 --> 00:44:45,088
it repairs itself. It changes.

728
00:44:45,633 --> 00:44:48,986
- But you can't!
- I'm sorry, it's too late.

729
00:44:51,749 --> 00:44:53,280
I'm regenerating.

730
00:45:36,542 --> 00:45:40,896
