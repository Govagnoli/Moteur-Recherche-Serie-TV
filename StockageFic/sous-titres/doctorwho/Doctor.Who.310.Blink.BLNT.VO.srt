Kathy?

00:03:02,198 --> 00:03:05,158
(voice from television)
Your life could depend on this.
Don't blink!

3
00:03:05,158 --> 00:03:07,278
Don't even blink.
Blink and you're dead.

4
00:03:08,838 --> 00:03:11,398
They are fast,
faster than you can believe.

5
00:03:11,398 --> 00:03:12,558
Don't turn your back,

6
00:03:12,558 --> 00:03:15,278
don't look away, and don't blink.

7
00:03:16,838 --> 00:03:18,318
Good luck.

Hello?

10
00:03:40,958 --> 00:03:43,758
Bit freaked.
Need to talk. Making you a coffee.

11
00:03:43,758 --> 00:03:47,038
(Kathy)
Sally Sparrow,
it's one in the morning.

12
00:03:47,038 --> 00:03:49,528
You think I'm coming round
at one in the morning?

13
00:03:49,529 --> 00:03:50,358
No.

14
00:03:50,358 --> 00:03:52,078
(Sally)
I'm in the kitchen.

15
00:03:52,078 --> 00:03:54,918
What's that on all those
screens in your front room?

16
00:03:54,918 --> 00:03:57,318
Oh, God!

17
00:03:57,318 --> 00:04:00,558
Oh, God! Sally, you've met
my brother Larry, haven't you?

18
00:04:00,558 --> 00:04:02,718
-No.
-You're about to.

19
00:04:04,918 --> 00:04:05,998
(Larry)
OK.

20
00:04:05,998 --> 00:04:12,398
Not sure, but really, really hoping.

21
00:04:13,238 --> 00:04:15,558
-Pants?
-No.

22
00:04:19,158 --> 00:04:21,798
(Kathy)
Put them on! Put them on!

23
00:04:21,798 --> 00:04:25,558
I hate you! What were you thinking?!

24
00:04:27,358 --> 00:04:28,398
Sorry.

25
00:04:28,398 --> 00:04:32,438
My useless brother.

26
00:04:32,438 --> 00:04:36,518
Sally! What's wrong?

27
00:04:36,518 --> 00:04:38,038
What's happened?

28
00:04:42,158 --> 00:04:44,998
(Kathy)
OK! Let's investigate!

29
00:04:44,998 --> 00:04:49,558
You and me, girl investigators.
Love it!

30
00:04:49,558 --> 00:04:51,798
Hey! Sparrow and Nightingale!

31
00:04:51,798 --> 00:04:54,158
-That SO works!
-Bit ITV.

32
00:04:54,158 --> 00:04:55,598
I know!

33
00:04:58,718 --> 00:05:01,758
(Kathy)
What did you come here for, anyway?

34
00:05:01,758 --> 00:05:04,278
(Sally)
I love old things.

35
00:05:04,278 --> 00:05:05,958
They make me feel sad.

36
00:05:05,958 --> 00:05:09,678
(Kathy)
What's good about sad?

37
00:05:09,678 --> 00:05:11,918
(Sally)
It's happy for deep people.

38
00:05:27,558 --> 00:05:29,158
The weeping angel.

39
00:05:29,158 --> 00:05:31,918
(Kathy)
Wouldn't have that in my garden.

40
00:05:31,918 --> 00:05:34,238
It's moved.

41
00:05:34,238 --> 00:05:35,998
It's what?

42
00:05:35,998 --> 00:05:37,838
Since yesterday.

43
00:05:37,838 --> 00:05:40,278
I'm sure of it. It's closer.

44
00:05:40,278 --> 00:05:41,878
It's got closer to the house.

45
00:05:52,158 --> 00:05:55,358
(Sally)
How can my name be written here?

46
00:05:56,718 --> 00:05:58,758
How is that possible?

48
00:06:02,478 --> 00:06:05,998
Who'd come here?

49
00:06:05,998 --> 00:06:08,518
What are you doing?!
It could be a burglar!

50
00:06:08,518 --> 00:06:10,478
A burglar who rings the doorbell(?)

51
00:06:11,958 --> 00:06:14,038
OK. I'll stay here in case of...

52
00:06:14,038 --> 00:06:17,478
-In case of...?
-..incidents?

53
00:06:30,758 --> 00:06:33,278
I'm looking for Sally Sparrow.

54
00:06:34,358 --> 00:06:35,758
How did you know I'd be here?

55
00:06:36,798 --> 00:06:39,438
I was told to bring this letter

56
00:06:39,438 --> 00:06:42,678
on this date at this exact time

57
00:06:42,678 --> 00:06:45,758
to Sally Sparrow.

58
00:06:45,758 --> 00:06:48,958
-It looks old.
-It is old.

59
00:06:48,958 --> 00:06:53,198
I'm sorry, do you have anything
with a photograph on it,
like a driving licence?

60
00:06:55,678 --> 00:06:57,838
(Sally)
How did he know I was coming here?

61
00:06:57,838 --> 00:06:59,758
I didn't tell anyone.

62
00:06:59,758 --> 00:07:01,718
How could anyone know?

63
00:07:01,718 --> 00:07:06,838
(Man)
It's all a bit complicated.
I'm not sure I understand it myself.

64
00:07:17,758 --> 00:07:22,478
(Man)
I'm sorry, I feel really stupid, but
I was told to make absolutely sure.

65
00:07:22,478 --> 00:07:25,388
It's so hard to tell with these
little photographs, isn't it?

66
00:07:25,389 --> 00:07:26,358
(Sally)
Apparently.

67
00:07:30,998 --> 00:07:33,838
Well, here goes, I suppose.

68
00:07:35,718 --> 00:07:38,198
(Man)
Funny feeling,
after all these years.

69
00:07:38,198 --> 00:07:39,518
Who's it from?

70
00:07:39,518 --> 00:07:41,878
Well, that's a long story, actually.

71
00:07:41,878 --> 00:07:44,158
Gimme a name.

72
00:07:44,158 --> 00:07:47,358
Katherine Wainwright.

73
00:07:47,358 --> 00:07:53,038
But she specified I should tell
you that prior to marriage
she was called Kathy Nightingale.

74
00:07:56,318 --> 00:08:02,558
-Kathy?
-Kathy, yes.

75
00:08:02,558 --> 00:08:06,598
-Katherine Costello Nightingale.
-Is this a joke?

76
00:08:06,598 --> 00:08:08,118
A joke?!

77
00:08:09,158 --> 00:08:12,958
Kathy, is this you? Very funny(!)

78
00:08:12,958 --> 00:08:14,998
Kathy?

79
00:08:21,838 --> 00:08:24,318
COWS MOO

80
00:08:25,438 --> 00:08:27,678
Kathy? Kathy!

81
00:08:27,678 --> 00:08:31,398
Please, you need to take this.

82
00:08:31,398 --> 00:08:32,918
I promised.

83
00:08:35,398 --> 00:08:37,518
(Kathy)
Excuse me?

84
00:08:37,518 --> 00:08:39,318
Where am I?

85
00:08:39,318 --> 00:08:41,238
I was in London.

86
00:08:41,238 --> 00:08:44,198
-I was in the middle of London.
-You're in Hull.

87
00:08:44,198 --> 00:08:46,078
No, I'm not.

88
00:08:46,078 --> 00:08:47,878
-This is Hull.
-No, it isn't.

89
00:08:47,878 --> 00:08:49,558
You're in Hull.

90
00:08:49,558 --> 00:08:52,558
I'm not in Hull. Stop saying Hull.

91
00:08:52,558 --> 00:08:53,678
(Sally)
Who are you?

92
00:08:53,678 --> 00:08:55,598
Why are you here?

93
00:08:55,598 --> 00:08:58,158
-I made a promise.
-Who to?

94
00:08:58,158 --> 00:09:01,918
My grandmother.
Katherine Costello Nightingale.

95
00:09:01,918 --> 00:09:06,078
(young man)
Don't have that in London. There's
no call for it. It's all Hull.

96
00:09:08,638 --> 00:09:10,438
(Kathy)
1920?

97
00:09:13,198 --> 00:09:14,958
-Your grandmother?
-Yes.

98
00:09:14,958 --> 00:09:16,678
She died 20 years ago.

99
00:09:24,518 --> 00:09:27,598
-So they're related?
-I'm sorry?

100
00:09:27,598 --> 00:09:31,198
My Kathy, your grandmother -
they're practically identical.

101
00:09:33,438 --> 00:09:34,598
Where are you going?

102
00:09:38,758 --> 00:09:40,678

"I named her after you, of course."

This is sick!

110
00:10:06,758 --> 00:10:09,518
This is totally sick!

(Ben)
Yeah.

00:14:05,438 --> 00:14:08,118
Hang on. We've met, haven't we?

144
00:14:08,118 --> 00:14:09,998
It'll come to you.

-There it is.
-Sorry.  Sorry again about the whole...

-Message from your sister.
-Oh! OK!

148
00:14:22,358 --> 00:14:26,118
What?
What is it? What's the message?

149
00:14:26,118 --> 00:14:27,798
She's had to go away for a bit.

150
00:14:27,798 --> 00:14:29,878
-Where?
-Just a work thing.

151
00:14:29,878 --> 00:14:31,158
Nothing to worry about.

152
00:14:31,158 --> 00:14:33,718
-OK.
-And...

153
00:14:35,278 --> 00:14:36,438
And what?

154
00:14:36,438 --> 00:14:38,118
She loves you.

155
00:14:38,118 --> 00:14:39,758
She what?!

156
00:14:39,758 --> 00:14:42,318
She said to say.
She just sort of mentioned it.

157
00:14:42,318 --> 00:14:45,998
She loves you.
There, that's nice, isn't it?

158
00:14:45,998 --> 00:14:48,518
-Is she ill?
-No! No.

159
00:14:48,518 --> 00:14:50,678
-Am I ill?
-No!

160
00:14:50,678 --> 00:14:54,718
-Is this a trick?
-No. She loves you.

161
00:14:54,718 --> 00:14:57,718
(Doctor on TV)
People don't understand time.

162
00:14:57,718 --> 00:14:59,638
It's not what you think it is.

163
00:14:59,638 --> 00:15:00,698
Who is this guy?

164
00:15:00,699 --> 00:15:03,878
Sorry, the pause thing
keeps slipping. Stupid thing.

165
00:15:03,878 --> 00:15:07,318
Last night at Kathy's, you had him
on those screens. That same guy.

166
00:15:07,318 --> 00:15:09,838
Talking about,
I dunno, blinking or something.

167
00:15:09,838 --> 00:15:12,078
Yeah, the bit about
the blinking's great!

168
00:15:12,078 --> 00:15:14,478
I was checking to see
if they were all the same.

169
00:15:14,478 --> 00:15:16,468
What were the same? What is this?
Who is he?

170
00:15:16,469 --> 00:15:18,198
An Easter egg.

171
00:15:18,198 --> 00:15:19,131
Excuse me?

172
00:15:19,132 --> 00:15:20,998
Like a DVD extra, yeah?

173
00:15:20,998 --> 00:15:24,638
You know how on DVDs they put
extras on, documentaries and stuff?

174
00:15:24,638 --> 00:15:28,158
Sometimes they put on hidden ones,
and they call them Easter eggs.

175
00:15:28,158 --> 00:15:31,198
You have to look for them,
follow clues in the menu screen.

Complicated.

177
00:15:32,599 --> 00:15:33,998
(Larry)
Sorry.

178
00:15:33,998 --> 00:15:36,198
It's interesting, actually.

179
00:15:36,198 --> 00:15:39,278
He is on 17 different DVDs.

180
00:15:39,278 --> 00:15:42,558
There are 17 totally unrelated
DVDs, all with him on,

181
00:15:42,558 --> 00:15:44,958
always hidden away, always a secret.

182
00:15:44,958 --> 00:15:47,318
Not even the publishers know
how he got there.

183
00:15:47,318 --> 00:15:50,918
I've talked to the manufacturers,
right? They don't even know.

184
00:15:50,918 --> 00:15:52,798
It's like he's a ghost DVD extra.

185
00:15:52,798 --> 00:15:57,118
Just shows up
where he's not supposed to be.
But only on those. Those 17.

186
00:15:57,118 --> 00:15:58,598
Well, what does he do?

187
00:15:58,598 --> 00:16:00,798
Just sits there
making random remarks.

188
00:16:00,798 --> 00:16:03,278
It's like we're hearing
half a conversation.

189
00:16:03,278 --> 00:16:06,318
Me and the guys are always
trying to work out the other half.

190
00:16:06,318 --> 00:16:10,278
When you say you and the guys,
you mean the internet, don't you?

191
00:16:10,278 --> 00:16:12,838
-How do you know?
-Spooky, isn't it?

192
00:16:14,318 --> 00:16:15,678
Very complicated.

193
00:16:15,678 --> 00:16:18,478
(man at counter)
Florence? Need you!

194
00:16:18,478 --> 00:16:19,958
'Scuse me a sec.

195
00:16:21,558 --> 00:16:25,318
People assume that time is a strict
progression of cause to effect,

196
00:16:25,318 --> 00:16:28,478
but actually from a non-linear,
non-subjective viewpoint,

197
00:16:28,478 --> 00:16:33,478
it's more like a big ball of
wibbly-wobbly, timey-wimey stuff.

198
00:16:33,478 --> 00:16:35,198
Started well, that sentence.

199
00:16:35,198 --> 00:16:37,718
It got away from me, yeah.

200
00:16:37,718 --> 00:16:39,678
OK, that was weird.

201
00:16:39,678 --> 00:16:40,938
(Sally)
Like you can hear me.

202
00:16:40,939 --> 00:16:42,198
Well, I CAN hear you.

203
00:16:42,198 --> 00:16:43,838
OK, that's enough.

204
00:16:43,838 --> 00:16:47,878
I've had enough now. I've had a
long day and I've had bloody enough!

205
00:16:47,878 --> 00:16:49,438
Sorry.

206
00:16:49,438 --> 00:16:51,598
Bad day.

207
00:16:51,598 --> 00:16:53,878
Got you the list.

208
00:16:53,878 --> 00:16:55,638
What?

209
00:16:55,638 --> 00:16:59,358
The 17 DVDs.
I thought you might be interested.

210
00:16:59,358 --> 00:17:01,718
Yeah, great, thanks!

211
00:17:04,278 --> 00:17:07,318
(man at counter)
Go to the police, you stupid woman!

212
00:17:07,318 --> 00:17:10,038
Why does nobody ever
just go to the police?

213
00:17:20,878 --> 00:17:23,158
(Sally)
Look, I know how mad I'm sounding.

214
00:17:23,518 --> 00:17:25,598
Shall we try it from the beginning?

215
00:17:25,598 --> 00:17:29,838
OK. There's this house,
a big old house,
been empty for years, falling apart.

216
00:17:29,838 --> 00:17:33,278
Wester Drumlins, out by the estate.
You've probably seen it.

217
00:17:33,278 --> 00:17:34,998
-Wester Drumlins?
-Yes.

218
00:17:34,998 --> 00:17:37,598
Could you just
wait here for a minute?

219
00:17:37,598 --> 00:17:38,958
SHE SIGHS

220
00:17:40,438 --> 00:17:42,078
THUNDER RUMBLES

221
00:18:09,038 --> 00:18:11,878
OK, cracking up now.

222
00:18:13,758 --> 00:18:16,398
Hi. DI Billy Shipton.

223
00:18:16,398 --> 00:18:18,158
Wester Drumlins, that's mine.

224
00:18:18,158 --> 00:18:22,878
Can't talk to you now,
got a thing I can't be late for,
so if you could just...

225
00:18:22,878 --> 00:18:24,958
Hello!

226
00:18:24,958 --> 00:18:27,118
Hello.

227
00:18:27,118 --> 00:18:31,638
Er, Marcie, can you tell them
I'm gonna be late for that thing?

228
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,078
Sally:All of them?
Billy: Over the last two years, yeah.

229
00:18:40,078 --> 00:18:44,598
(Billy)
They all still had personal items in them
and a couple still had the motor running.

230
00:18:44,598 --> 00:18:48,078
(Sally)
So over the last two years the
owners of all of these vehicles have

231
00:18:48,078 --> 00:18:52,758
driven up to Wester Drumlins House,
parked outside and just disappeared.

232
00:18:55,598 --> 00:18:57,878
(Sally)
What's that?

233
00:18:57,878 --> 00:19:00,958
(Billy)
Ah! The pride of the
Wester Drumlins collection.

234
00:19:00,958 --> 00:19:05,478
We found that there, too. Somebody's
idea of a joke, I suppose.

235
00:19:05,478 --> 00:19:07,438
But what is it? What's a police box?

236
00:19:07,438 --> 00:19:10,198
Well, it's a special kind
of phone box for policemen.

237
00:19:10,198 --> 00:19:13,158
They used to have them all over.
But this isn't a real one.

238
00:19:13,158 --> 00:19:16,238
The phone's just a dummy, and
the windows are the wrong size.

239
00:19:16,238 --> 00:19:18,078
We can't even get in it.

240
00:19:18,078 --> 00:19:21,038
Ordinary Yale lock,
but nothing fits.

241
00:19:21,038 --> 00:19:23,598
But that's not the big question.

242
00:19:23,598 --> 00:19:26,838
See,
you're missing the big question.

243
00:19:26,838 --> 00:19:29,118
OK, what's the big question?

244
00:19:29,118 --> 00:19:31,118
Will you have a drink with me?

245
00:19:31,118 --> 00:19:33,398
I'm sorry?

246
00:19:33,398 --> 00:19:36,478
Drink, you, me, now?

247
00:19:36,478 --> 00:19:39,798
Aren't you on duty,
Detective Inspector Shipton?

248
00:19:39,798 --> 00:19:42,398
Nope. Knocked off before I left.

249
00:19:42,398 --> 00:19:44,598
Told 'em I had a family crisis.

250
00:19:44,598 --> 00:19:46,998
-Why?
-Because life is short and you are hot.

251
00:19:46,998 --> 00:19:50,038
-Drink?
-No.

252
00:19:50,038 --> 00:19:51,798
-Ever?
-Maybe.

253
00:19:51,798 --> 00:19:53,758
Phone number?

254
00:19:53,758 --> 00:19:55,438
Moving kind of fast, DI Shipton.

255
00:19:55,438 --> 00:19:57,038
Billy. I'm off duty.

256
00:19:57,038 --> 00:19:58,518
Aren't you just!

257
00:20:00,438 --> 00:20:03,638
Is that your phone number?
Just my phone number.

258
00:20:03,638 --> 00:20:09,478
Not a promise, not a guarantee,
not an IOU, just a phone number.

259
00:20:09,478 --> 00:20:12,558
-And that's Sally...?
-Sally Shipton. Sparrow!

260
00:20:12,558 --> 00:20:14,038
Sally Sparrow.

261
00:20:15,758 --> 00:20:17,378
I'm going now. Don't look at me.

262
00:20:17,379 --> 00:20:18,998
-I'll phone you!
-Don't look at me.

263
00:20:18,998 --> 00:20:20,998
-Phone you tomorrow.
-Don't look at me!

264
00:20:20,998 --> 00:20:22,571
Might even phone you tonight.

265
00:20:22,572 --> 00:20:25,718
-Don't look at me!
-Definitely gonna phone you, gorgeous girl!

266
00:20:25,718 --> 00:20:26,998
(Sally)
You definitely better!

267
00:21:38,638 --> 00:21:41,718
Ordinary Yale lock,
but nothing fits.

268
00:22:05,798 --> 00:22:08,318
(Doctor)
Welcome.

269
00:22:08,318 --> 00:22:09,598
(Billy)
Where am I?

270
00:22:09,599 --> 00:22:13,438
(Doctor)
1969. Not bad,as it goes. You've got
the moon landing to look forward to.

271
00:22:13,438 --> 00:22:16,358
Oh, the moon landing's brilliant.
We went four times.

272
00:22:16,358 --> 00:22:18,998
-Back when we had transport...
-Working on it!

273
00:22:18,998 --> 00:22:22,038
-How did I get here?
-The same way we did. The touch of an angel.

274
00:22:22,038 --> 00:22:25,798
Same one, probably,
since you ended up in the same year.
No, don't get up.

275
00:22:25,798 --> 00:22:30,558
Time travel without a capsule,
nasty. Catch your breath, don't
go swimming for half an hour.

276
00:22:30,558 --> 00:22:31,958
I don't. I can't.

277
00:22:31,958 --> 00:22:34,078
Fascinating race,
the weeping angels.

278
00:22:34,078 --> 00:22:37,078
The only psychopaths
in the universe to kill you nicely.

279
00:22:37,078 --> 00:22:40,998
No mess, no fuss,
they just zap you into the past
and let you live to death.

280
00:22:40,998 --> 00:22:44,518
The rest of your life used up and
blown away in the blink of an eye.

281
00:22:44,518 --> 00:22:49,438
You die in the past, and in the
present they consume the energy
of all the days you might have had,

282
00:22:49,438 --> 00:22:54,998
all your stolen moments.
They're creatures of the abstract.
They live off potential energy.

283
00:22:54,998 --> 00:22:57,358
What in God's name
are you talking about?

284
00:22:57,358 --> 00:22:59,678
Trust me.
Just nod when he stops for breath.

285
00:22:59,678 --> 00:23:03,838
Tracked you down with this.
This is my timey-wimey detector.

286
00:23:03,838 --> 00:23:06,278
It goes ding when there's stuff.

287
00:23:06,278 --> 00:23:08,198
Also,
it can boil an egg at 30 paces,

288
00:23:08,198 --> 00:23:11,838
whether you want it to or not, so
I've learned to stay away from hens.

289
00:23:11,838 --> 00:23:13,758
It's not pretty when they blow.

290
00:23:15,318 --> 00:23:16,958
I don't understand. Where am I?

291
00:23:16,958 --> 00:23:19,038
1969, like he says.

292
00:23:19,038 --> 00:23:22,878
Normally, I'd offer you a lift
home, but somebody nicked my motor.

293
00:23:22,878 --> 00:23:27,438
So I need you to take
a message to Sally Sparrow.

294
00:23:27,438 --> 00:23:32,678
And I'm sorry, Billy,
I am very, very sorry.

295
00:23:32,678 --> 00:23:34,638
It's going to take you a while.

296
00:23:36,158 --> 00:23:37,958
PHONE RINGS

297
00:23:37,958 --> 00:23:39,878
Hello?

298
00:23:39,878 --> 00:23:41,838
Billy, where are you?

299
00:23:43,438 --> 00:23:44,878
Where?

300
00:24:01,278 --> 00:24:02,398
Billy?

301
00:24:20,118 --> 00:24:22,118
It was raining when we met.

302
00:24:24,598 --> 00:24:26,318
It's the same rain.

303
00:24:38,078 --> 00:24:41,598
-She looks nice.
-Her name was Sally too.

304
00:24:41,598 --> 00:24:43,518
(Sally)
Sally Shipton.

305
00:24:43,518 --> 00:24:45,478
(Billy)
Sally Shipton!

306
00:24:48,878 --> 00:24:52,318
I often thought about looking
for you before tonight,

307
00:24:52,318 --> 00:24:56,838
but apparently it would've torn a
hole in the fabric of space and time

308
00:24:56,838 --> 00:24:59,638
and destroyed two thirds
of the universe.

309
00:25:01,198 --> 00:25:03,558
Also I'd lost my hair.

310
00:25:04,638 --> 00:25:07,238
Two thirds of the universe.
Where'd you get that?

311
00:25:07,238 --> 00:25:11,598
There's a man in 1969.
He sent me with a message for you.

312
00:25:11,598 --> 00:25:13,398
-What man?
-The Doctor.

313
00:25:14,958 --> 00:25:17,878
-And what was the message?
-Just this.

314
00:25:17,878 --> 00:25:19,518
Look at the list.

315
00:25:19,518 --> 00:25:22,118
What does that mean?
Is that it, look at the list?

316
00:25:22,118 --> 00:25:23,958
He said you'd have it by now.

317
00:25:23,958 --> 00:25:25,878
A list of 17 DVDs.

318
00:25:32,118 --> 00:25:33,998
I didn't stay a policeman back then.

319
00:25:33,998 --> 00:25:36,238
Got into publishing.

320
00:25:36,238 --> 00:25:38,118
Then video publishing.

321
00:25:38,118 --> 00:25:40,798
Then DVDs, of course.

322
00:25:42,318 --> 00:25:43,598
You put the Easter Egg on?

323
00:25:46,918 --> 00:25:50,678
Have you noticed what
all 17 DVDs have in common yet?

324
00:25:50,678 --> 00:25:54,718
I suppose it's hard for you,
in a way.

325
00:25:54,718 --> 00:25:58,278
How could the Doctor have even known
I had a list? I only just got this.

326
00:25:58,278 --> 00:26:01,718
I asked him how, but he said
he couldn't tell me.

327
00:26:01,718 --> 00:26:04,838
He said you'd understand it one day,

328
00:26:04,838 --> 00:26:08,518
but that I never would.

329
00:26:08,518 --> 00:26:11,838
Soon as I understand it,
I'll come and tell you.

330
00:26:11,838 --> 00:26:15,438
No, gorgeous girl, you can't.

331
00:26:15,438 --> 00:26:17,518
There's only tonight.

332
00:26:17,518 --> 00:26:23,478
He told me all those years ago that
we'd only meet again this one time.

333
00:26:23,478 --> 00:26:25,118
On the night I die.

334
00:26:26,678 --> 00:26:28,238
Oh, Billy.

335
00:26:28,238 --> 00:26:30,318
It's kept me going.

336
00:26:30,318 --> 00:26:32,478
I'm an old, sick man.

337
00:26:32,478 --> 00:26:35,358
But I've had something to look
forward to.

338
00:26:39,318 --> 00:26:42,358
Ah, life is long.

339
00:26:42,358 --> 00:26:43,758
And you are hot.

340
00:26:48,838 --> 00:26:49,918
Oh, look at my hands.

341
00:26:49,918 --> 00:26:54,118
They're old man's hands.

342
00:26:54,118 --> 00:26:55,638
How did that happen?

343
00:26:58,838 --> 00:27:00,638
I'll stay.

344
00:27:00,638 --> 00:27:03,318
I'm going to stay with you. OK?

345
00:27:03,318 --> 00:27:05,518
Thank you, Sally Sparrow.

346
00:27:08,638 --> 00:27:10,438
I have till the rain stops.

347
00:27:42,558 --> 00:27:44,078
PHONE RINGS

348
00:27:44,078 --> 00:27:44,944
Banto's.

349
00:27:44,945 --> 00:27:46,678
Sally: They're mine.
Larry: What?

350
00:27:46,678 --> 00:27:49,318
The DVDs on the list. The 17 DVDs.

351
00:27:49,318 --> 00:27:51,078
What they've got in common is me.

352
00:27:51,078 --> 00:27:52,678
They're all the DVDs I own.

353
00:27:52,678 --> 00:27:55,118
The Easter Egg was intended for me!

354
00:27:55,118 --> 00:27:57,358
You've only got 17 DVDs?

355
00:27:57,358 --> 00:27:59,838
Do you have a portable DVD player?

356
00:27:59,838 --> 00:28:01,758
-Course, why?
-I want you to meet me.

357
00:28:01,758 --> 00:28:05,078
-Where?
-Wester Drumlins.

358
00:28:06,838 --> 00:28:09,078
You live in Scooby Doo's house!

359
00:28:10,638 --> 00:28:12,318
For God's sake, I don't live here!

360
00:28:14,318 --> 00:28:16,838
OK, this is the one
with the clearest sound.

361
00:28:16,838 --> 00:28:19,958
Slightly better picture quality
on this one, but I don't...

362
00:28:19,958 --> 00:28:21,038
Doesn't matter.

363
00:28:21,038 --> 00:28:22,518
OK.

364
00:28:30,438 --> 00:28:31,918
There he is.

365
00:28:36,718 --> 00:28:38,718
The Doctor!

366
00:28:38,718 --> 00:28:40,278
Who's the Doctor?

367
00:28:40,278 --> 00:28:42,718
-He's the Doctor.
-Yep. That's me.

368
00:28:42,718 --> 00:28:44,358
OK, that was scary.

369
00:28:44,358 --> 00:28:47,358
No, it sounds like he's
replying, but he always says that.

370
00:28:47,358 --> 00:28:48,398
(Doctor)
Yes, I do.

371
00:28:48,398 --> 00:28:50,438
Larry: And that.
Doctor: Yep, and this.

372
00:28:50,438 --> 00:28:54,198
He can hear us.
Oh, my God, you can really hear us!

373
00:28:54,198 --> 00:28:55,838
Of course he can't hear us. Look!

374
00:28:58,718 --> 00:29:01,318
I've got a transcript,
see, everything he says.

375
00:29:01,318 --> 00:29:04,718
"Yep, that's me". "Yes, I do".
"Yep, and this". Next it's...

376
00:29:04,718 --> 00:29:07,198
BOTH: Are you going to read
out the whole thing?

377
00:29:07,198 --> 00:29:08,678
-Sorry.
-Who are you?

378
00:29:08,678 --> 00:29:10,398
I'm a time traveller.

379
00:29:10,398 --> 00:29:14,518
Or I was. I'm stuck in 1969.

380
00:29:14,518 --> 00:29:17,438
We're stuck. All of space and time,
he promised me.

381
00:29:17,438 --> 00:29:19,574
Now I've got a job in a shop,
I've got to support him!

382
00:29:19,575 --> 00:29:20,998
-Martha!
-Sorry.

383
00:29:20,998 --> 00:29:22,478
I've seen this bit before.

384
00:29:22,478 --> 00:29:25,078
(Doctor)
Quite possibly.

385
00:29:25,078 --> 00:29:28,228
1969, that's where you're talking from?

386
00:29:28,229 --> 00:29:29,278
'Fraid so.

387
00:29:29,278 --> 00:29:31,678
But you're replying to me.

388
00:29:31,678 --> 00:29:34,998
You can't know exactly what I'll say,
40 years before I say it!

389
00:29:34,998 --> 00:29:37,078
-38.
-I'm getting this down!

390
00:29:37,078 --> 00:29:39,838
-I'm writing in your bits!!
-How? How is this possible?

391
00:29:39,838 --> 00:29:42,158
-Tell me!
-Not so fast.

392
00:29:42,158 --> 00:29:44,118
People don't understand time.

393
00:29:44,118 --> 00:29:46,518
-It's not what you think it is.
-Then what is it?

394
00:29:46,518 --> 00:29:48,918
-Complicated.
-Tell me.

395
00:29:48,918 --> 00:29:50,518
Very complicated.

396
00:29:50,518 --> 00:29:52,238
I'm clever and I'm listening.

397
00:29:52,238 --> 00:29:55,678
And don't patronise me because
people have died, and I'm not happy.

398
00:29:55,678 --> 00:29:57,158
Tell me!

399
00:29:58,718 --> 00:30:02,518
People assume that time is a strict
progression of cause to effect,

400
00:30:02,518 --> 00:30:05,598
but actually from a non-linear,
non-subjective viewpoint,

401
00:30:05,598 --> 00:30:09,598
it's more like a big ball of
wibbly-wobbly, timey-wimey stuff.

402
00:30:09,598 --> 00:30:13,398
Yeah, I've seen this bit before. You
said that sentence got away from you.

403
00:30:13,398 --> 00:30:15,198
It got away from me, yeah.

404
00:30:15,198 --> 00:30:18,158
Next thing you're going to say is,
"Well, I CAN hear you".

405
00:30:18,158 --> 00:30:20,998
-Well, I CAN hear you.
-This isn't possible! No!

406
00:30:20,998 --> 00:30:22,678
It's brilliant!

407
00:30:22,678 --> 00:30:25,758
Not hear you exactly, but
I know everything you'll to say.

408
00:30:25,758 --> 00:30:27,758
Always gives me the shivers, that
bit.

409
00:30:27,758 --> 00:30:30,478
How can you know
what I'm going to say?

410
00:30:30,478 --> 00:30:33,558
-Look to your left.
-What does he mean by, "Look to your left"?

411
00:30:33,558 --> 00:30:37,558
(Larry)
I've written tons about that on the
forums. I think it's a political statement.

412
00:30:37,558 --> 00:30:41,318
He means you. What are you doing?

413
00:30:41,318 --> 00:30:42,558
Writing in your bits.

414
00:30:42,558 --> 00:30:45,758
So I've got a complete transcript
of the whole conversation.

415
00:30:45,758 --> 00:30:49,318
Wait till this hits the net.
This will explode the egg forums.

416
00:30:49,318 --> 00:30:52,998
(Doctor)
I've got a copy of the finished
transcript. It's on my autocue.

417
00:30:52,998 --> 00:30:56,678
How can you have a copy of the
finished transcript. It is still being written.

418
00:30:56,678 --> 00:30:59,366
I told you. I'm a time traveller.
I got it in the future.

419
00:30:59,367 --> 00:31:01,158
OK, let me get my head round this.

420
00:31:01,158 --> 00:31:05,078
You're reading from a transcript of
a conversation you're still having?

421
00:31:05,078 --> 00:31:07,558
Wibbly-wobbly, timey-wimey.

422
00:31:07,558 --> 00:31:09,318
Actually, never mind that.

423
00:31:09,318 --> 00:31:10,918
You can do shorthand?

424
00:31:10,918 --> 00:31:12,838
So?

425
00:31:12,838 --> 00:31:15,518
What matters is we can communicate.

426
00:31:15,518 --> 00:31:17,078
We have got big problems now.

427
00:31:17,078 --> 00:31:19,198
They've taken the blue box, haven't
they?

428
00:31:19,198 --> 00:31:20,718
The angels have the phone box.

429
00:31:20,718 --> 00:31:22,558
The angels have the phone box!

430
00:31:22,558 --> 00:31:24,338
That's my favourite,
I have it on a T-shirt!

431
00:31:24,339 --> 00:31:26,118
What do you mean, angels?

432
00:31:26,118 --> 00:31:29,238
You mean those statue things?

433
00:31:29,238 --> 00:31:33,358
Creatures from another world.
They're just statues.
Only when you see them.

434
00:31:33,358 --> 00:31:36,758
-What does that mean?
-Lonely assassins, they were called.

435
00:31:36,758 --> 00:31:40,718
No-one knows where they came from.
They're as old as the universe,
or nearly.

436
00:31:40,718 --> 00:31:45,158
They've survived this long as they
have the most perfect
defence system ever evolved.

437
00:31:45,158 --> 00:31:48,518
They are quantum-locked. They don't
exist when being observed.

438
00:31:48,518 --> 00:31:52,358
The moment they're seen
by any living creature
they freeze into rock.

439
00:31:52,358 --> 00:31:54,158
It's a fact of their biology.

440
00:31:54,158 --> 00:31:58,078
In the sight of any living thing,
they literally turn to stone.

441
00:31:58,078 --> 00:32:00,718
And you can't kill a stone.

442
00:32:00,718 --> 00:32:02,798
Course,
a stone can't kill you either.

443
00:32:02,798 --> 00:32:08,318
But then you turn your head away,
then you blink, and oh, yes, it can!

444
00:32:08,318 --> 00:32:10,118
Don't take your eyes off that!

445
00:32:10,118 --> 00:32:15,078
That's why they cover their eyes.
They're not weeping, they
can't risk looking at each other.

446
00:32:15,078 --> 00:32:17,758
Their greatest asset
is their greatest curse.

447
00:32:17,758 --> 00:32:20,238
They can never be seen.

448
00:32:20,238 --> 00:32:22,998
The loneliest
creatures in the universe.

449
00:32:22,998 --> 00:32:27,598
And I'm sorry, I am very,
very sorry, it's up to you now.

450
00:32:27,598 --> 00:32:31,318
-What am I supposed to do?
-The blue box, my time machine.

451
00:32:31,318 --> 00:32:34,718
There is a world of time energy in
there they could feast on forever.

452
00:32:34,718 --> 00:32:37,038
The damage they can do
can switch off the sun.

453
00:32:37,038 --> 00:32:39,038
You have got to send it back to me!

454
00:32:39,038 --> 00:32:41,598
How? How??

455
00:32:41,598 --> 00:32:44,558
And that's it, I'm afraid.

456
00:32:44,558 --> 00:32:47,838
There's no more from you on the
transcript, that's all I've got.

457
00:32:47,838 --> 00:32:51,238
I dunno what stopped you talking,
but I can guess. They're coming.

458
00:32:51,238 --> 00:32:53,678
The angels are coming for you.

459
00:32:53,678 --> 00:32:59,278
Listen, your life could depend on
this. Don't blink! Don't even blink.
Blink and you're dead.

460
00:32:59,278 --> 00:33:05,238
They're fast, faster than you can
believe. Don't turn your back,
don't look away, and don't blink!

461
00:33:06,838 --> 00:33:09,118
Good luck!

462
00:33:10,158 --> 00:33:12,878
No, don't, you can't!

463
00:33:12,878 --> 00:33:15,478
I'll rewind him!
What good would that do?!

464
00:33:17,398 --> 00:33:19,198
You're not looking at the statue?

465
00:33:19,198 --> 00:33:20,598
Neither are you.

466
00:33:25,878 --> 00:33:28,478
Keep looking at it,
keep looking at it!!

467
00:33:28,478 --> 00:33:31,758
(Larry)
There's just one, right,
there's just this one.

468
00:33:31,758 --> 00:33:35,438
We're OK if we keep staring at this
one statue, everything will be fine.

469
00:33:35,438 --> 00:33:37,078
-There's three more.
-Three?!

470
00:33:37,078 --> 00:33:38,726
They were upstairs,
I think I heard them moving.

471
00:33:38,727 --> 00:33:41,198
Where? Three, moving where?

472
00:33:41,198 --> 00:33:45,238
I'll look around, I'm going to check.
Keep looking at this one,
don't blink.

473
00:33:45,238 --> 00:33:47,438
Remember what he said,
don't even blink!

474
00:33:47,438 --> 00:33:49,102
Who blinks? I'm too scared to blink.

475
00:33:49,103 --> 00:33:51,598
OK. We're going to the
door. The front door.

476
00:33:57,638 --> 00:34:01,148
OK. We can't both get to the door
without taking our eyes off that
thing. You stay here.

477
00:34:01,149 --> 00:34:02,318
What?!

478
00:34:02,318 --> 00:34:04,318
I'll be round the corner, stay here!

479
00:34:08,358 --> 00:34:10,608
They've locked it.
They've locked us in!

480
00:34:10,609 --> 00:34:11,358
Why?

481
00:34:11,358 --> 00:34:12,858
I've got something they want.

482
00:34:12,859 --> 00:34:13,358
What?

483
00:34:13,358 --> 00:34:16,958
A key I took last time I was here.
They followed me to get it back.

484
00:34:16,958 --> 00:34:19,518
I led them to the blue box!
Now they've got that!

485
00:34:19,518 --> 00:34:22,038
Give them the key!

486
00:34:22,038 --> 00:34:24,158
I'll check the back door,
you wait here.

487
00:34:24,158 --> 00:34:26,398
Give them the key,
give them what they want!

488
00:34:28,518 --> 00:34:30,638
(Larry)
Sally, no, what if
they come behind me?!

489
00:34:30,638 --> 00:34:33,438
(Sally)
Hang on!

490
00:34:33,438 --> 00:34:37,718
Oh, God! Oh, God!

491
00:34:37,718 --> 00:34:39,198
(Sally)
It's locked!

492
00:34:46,198 --> 00:34:48,038
Sally! Sally!

493
00:34:51,998 --> 00:34:53,598
(Sally)
It won't open!

494
00:34:58,478 --> 00:35:01,398
(Larry)
Sally, please, I can't do this!

495
00:35:05,678 --> 00:35:07,278
Sally, hurry up!

496
00:35:10,118 --> 00:35:12,358
(Larry)
Where are you?!

497
00:35:12,358 --> 00:35:17,278
Larry! They've blocked off the
back door, but there's a cellar.

498
00:35:17,278 --> 00:35:20,078
There might be a way out,
delivery hatch or something.

499
00:35:20,078 --> 00:35:23,238
I'm coming, I can't stay here!

500
00:35:42,598 --> 00:35:45,598
OK, boys, I know how this works.

501
00:35:45,598 --> 00:35:49,718
You can't move
so long as I can see you.

502
00:35:55,118 --> 00:35:57,358
Whole world in the box,
the Doctor says.

503
00:35:57,358 --> 00:36:02,398
Hope he's not lying, cos I don't see
how else we're getting out.

504
00:36:05,598 --> 00:36:07,518
Oh, and there's your one.

505
00:36:14,318 --> 00:36:15,838
Why's it pointing at the...

506
00:36:18,238 --> 00:36:19,238
..light?

507
00:36:19,238 --> 00:36:23,198
Oh, my God! It's turning out the lights!

508
00:36:23,198 --> 00:36:27,118
-Quickly! I can't find the lock!
-Sally, hurry up!

509
00:36:29,838 --> 00:36:32,678
They're getting faster, Sally,
come on!

510
00:36:32,678 --> 00:36:33,798
It won't turn!

511
00:36:37,198 --> 00:36:38,478
Sally!

512
00:36:57,078 --> 00:36:59,758
This is security protocol 712.

513
00:36:59,758 --> 00:37:04,998
This time capsule has detected
the presence of an authorised
control disc, valid one journey.

514
00:37:07,998 --> 00:37:11,278
Please insert the disc
and prepare for departure.

515
00:37:12,718 --> 00:37:14,838
Looks like a DVD player.
There's a slot.

516
00:37:16,878 --> 00:37:18,998
-They're trying to get in!
-Well, hurry up!

517
00:37:36,798 --> 00:37:37,838
(Sally)
What's happening?

518
00:37:37,838 --> 00:37:40,038
Oh, my God! It's leaving us behind!

519
00:37:40,038 --> 00:37:41,638
Doctor, no, you can't!

520
00:37:45,798 --> 00:37:48,878
THEY SCREAM

521
00:37:53,038 --> 00:37:54,718
Doctor!

522
00:38:08,158 --> 00:38:09,878
Look at them. Quick, look at them!

523
00:38:12,838 --> 00:38:15,278
I don't think we need to.

524
00:38:17,718 --> 00:38:21,518
He tricked them, The Doctor tricked
them. They're looking at each other.

525
00:38:21,518 --> 00:38:23,478
They're never going to move again.

526
00:38:50,478 --> 00:38:53,718
(Larry)
Can you mind the shop? I'm just
nipping next door for some milk.

527
00:38:53,718 --> 00:38:55,278
Yeah, no worries.

528
00:38:55,278 --> 00:38:56,958
What's this?

529
00:38:56,958 --> 00:38:58,198
Nothing.

530
00:39:08,078 --> 00:39:11,318
Oh, Sally!

531
00:39:11,318 --> 00:39:12,478
Can't you let it go?

532
00:39:12,478 --> 00:39:14,038
Of course I can't let it go!

533
00:39:14,038 --> 00:39:14,948
It's over.

534
00:39:14,949 --> 00:39:17,678
How did the Doctor know where
to write the words on the wall?

535
00:39:17,678 --> 00:39:19,718
How could he get the transcript?

536
00:39:19,718 --> 00:39:22,198
Where did he get
all that information from?

537
00:39:22,198 --> 00:39:25,198
Look, some things you never find
out. And that's OK.

538
00:39:25,198 --> 00:39:26,398
No, it isn't.

539
00:39:31,438 --> 00:39:36,478
Ever think this might be getting
in the way of...other things?

540
00:39:39,198 --> 00:39:40,798
We just run a shop together.

541
00:39:42,598 --> 00:39:44,078
That's all it is, just a shop.

542
00:39:46,238 --> 00:39:47,238
Anyway...

543
00:39:48,518 --> 00:39:49,518
..milk.

544
00:39:51,158 --> 00:39:52,638
Back in a mo.

545
00:40:13,358 --> 00:40:15,318
Doctor! Doctor! Doctor!

546
00:40:15,318 --> 00:40:16,838
Hello! Sorry, bit of a rush,

547
00:40:16,838 --> 00:40:20,158
there's a sort of thing happening,
fairly important we stop it.

548
00:40:20,158 --> 00:40:23,158
My God, it's you, it really is you.

549
00:40:23,158 --> 00:40:24,918
Oh, you don't remember me, do you?

550
00:40:24,918 --> 00:40:27,558
We don't have time for this!
Migration's started!

551
00:40:27,558 --> 00:40:29,958
Look, sorry,
I've got a bit of a complex life.

552
00:40:29,958 --> 00:40:32,278
Things don't always
happen to me in order.

553
00:40:32,278 --> 00:40:36,558
Gets confusing, especially weddings,
I'm rubbish at weddings, especially
my own.

554
00:40:36,558 --> 00:40:39,558
Oh, my God!
Of course, you're a time traveller.

555
00:40:39,558 --> 00:40:42,228
It hasn't happened yet! None of it,
it's still in your future!

556
00:40:42,229 --> 00:40:43,118
What?

557
00:40:43,118 --> 00:40:44,998
Doctor! 20 minutes to red hatching!

558
00:40:44,998 --> 00:40:46,318
It was me.

559
00:40:46,318 --> 00:40:50,118
Oh, for God's sake, it was me
all along. You got it all from me!

560
00:40:50,118 --> 00:40:53,078
-Got what?
-OK. Listen.

561
00:40:53,078 --> 00:40:56,038
One day you're going
to get stuck in 1969.

562
00:40:56,038 --> 00:40:57,958
Make sure you've got this with you.

563
00:40:57,958 --> 00:40:59,678
You're going to need it. Doctor!

564
00:40:59,678 --> 00:41:02,318
Yeah, listen,
got to dash...things happening.

565
00:41:02,318 --> 00:41:03,438
Well, four things.

566
00:41:03,438 --> 00:41:05,238
Well, four things and a lizard.

567
00:41:05,238 --> 00:41:09,598
OK. No worries, on you go.
See you around, some day.

568
00:41:09,598 --> 00:41:11,358
What was your name?

569
00:41:11,358 --> 00:41:12,958
Sally Sparrow.

570
00:41:12,958 --> 00:41:15,478
Good to meet you, Sally Sparrow.

571
00:41:27,198 --> 00:41:28,198
Goodbye, Doctor.

572
00:41:46,238 --> 00:41:47,238
Don't blink!

573
00:41:51,478 --> 00:41:54,158
Blink and you're dead!

574
00:41:55,278 --> 00:41:56,718
Don't turn your back.

575
00:41:58,598 --> 00:42:00,318
Don't look away.

576
00:42:01,638 --> 00:42:03,478
And don't blink!

577
00:42:09,358 --> 00:42:11,398
Good luck!

578
00:42:17,318 --> 00:42:19,358
We're going to the
end of the universe.

579
00:42:19,358 --> 00:42:21,838
The call came from across the stars.

580
00:42:21,838 --> 00:42:24,958
Over and over again, come to Utopia.

581
00:42:24,958 --> 00:42:25,998
Doctor.

582
00:42:25,998 --> 00:42:27,038
Captain.

583
00:42:36,518 --> 00:42:37,678
It's the Futurekind.

584
00:42:37,678 --> 00:42:41,158
-Utopia is?
-The last of the humans scattered across the night.

585
00:42:42,278 --> 00:42:43,558
Humans are coming.

586
00:42:43,558 --> 00:42:46,998
Not even the Time Lords
came this far. We should leave.

587
00:42:51,318 --> 00:42:54,358
