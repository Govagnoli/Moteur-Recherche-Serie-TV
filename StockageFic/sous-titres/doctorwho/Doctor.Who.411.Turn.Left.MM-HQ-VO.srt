1
00:00:27,588 --> 00:00:30,097
You're gonna love this.
One, two, three.

2
00:00:33,232 --> 00:00:34,120
It's lovely!

3
00:00:38,428 --> 00:00:39,961
You want to buy Shukina?

4
00:00:43,239 --> 00:00:46,379
<i>Or Peshwami? Most beautiful
Peshwami in all of Shan Shen.</i>

5
00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:47,920
Er, no, thanks.

6
00:00:57,371 --> 00:00:59,023
Tell your fortune, lady?

7
00:00:59,123 --> 00:01:00,618
The future predicted.

8
00:01:00,718 --> 00:01:03,771
- Your life foretold.
- Oh, no, thanks.

9
00:01:04,243 --> 00:01:07,527
Don't you want to know
if you're going to be happy?

10
00:01:08,728 --> 00:01:10,555
I'm happy right now, thanks.

11
00:01:10,843 --> 00:01:12,076
You've got red hair.

12
00:01:12,176 --> 00:01:14,373
The reading's free for red hair.

13
00:01:15,769 --> 00:01:16,701
All right, then.

14
00:01:28,951 --> 00:01:31,009
Oh, you're fascinating!

15
00:01:31,335 --> 00:01:33,242
No, but you're good.

16
00:01:33,946 --> 00:01:36,711
I can see... a man.

17
00:01:37,362 --> 00:01:39,850
The most remarkable man.

18
00:01:40,302 --> 00:01:41,599
How did you meet him?

19
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:43,219
You're supposed to tell me.

20
00:01:43,651 --> 00:01:45,059
I see the future.

21
00:01:45,678 --> 00:01:46,973
Tell me the past.

22
00:01:47,348 --> 00:01:49,213
When did your lives cross?

23
00:01:50,621 --> 00:01:52,210
It's sort of complicated.

24
00:01:52,572 --> 00:01:54,880
I ended up in his spaceship
on my wedding day.

25
00:01:55,306 --> 00:01:58,240
- Long story.
- But what led you to that meeting?

26
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,469
All sorts of things,

27
00:02:02,002 --> 00:02:04,104
but my job, I suppose.

28
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:07,552
It was on Earth,
this planet called Earth. Miles away.

29
00:02:07,889 --> 00:02:09,976
But I had this job, as a temp,

30
00:02:10,525 --> 00:02:13,050
I was a secretary,
in a place called HC Clements.

31
00:02:14,185 --> 00:02:16,170
<i>HC Clements, can I help you?</i>

32
00:02:21,795 --> 00:02:22,738
Sorry.

33
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:24,784
It's the incense.

34
00:02:25,109 --> 00:02:27,468
Just breathe deep.

35
00:02:29,213 --> 00:02:32,879
This job of yours.
What choices led you there?

36
00:02:34,531 --> 00:02:37,321
There was a choice.
Six months before.

37
00:02:38,335 --> 00:02:41,210
Cos the agency offered me
this contract with HC Clements.

38
00:02:42,289 --> 00:02:44,722
<i>There was this other job,
my mum knew this man...</i>

39
00:02:44,822 --> 00:02:48,752
Jival, he's called, Jival Chowdry.

40
00:02:50,016 --> 00:02:54,446
He runs that little photocopy
business and he needs a secretary.

41
00:02:54,546 --> 00:02:56,173
I've got a job!

42
00:02:56,273 --> 00:02:58,381
As a temp! This is permanent!

43
00:02:58,569 --> 00:03:00,422
It's 20,000 a year, Donna.

44
00:03:01,123 --> 00:03:03,326
HC Clements is in the City,

45
00:03:03,864 --> 00:03:07,330
it's nice, it's posh, so stop it!

46
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:14,060
Your life could have
gone one way or the other.

47
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:17,770
- What made you decide?
- I just did.

48
00:03:18,221 --> 00:03:19,737
But when was the moment?

49
00:03:20,181 --> 00:03:21,689
When did you choose?

50
00:03:24,379 --> 00:03:26,738
It won't take long, just turn right,

51
00:03:26,838 --> 00:03:30,485
we'll pop in and see Mr Chowdry,
so Suzette can introduce you.

52
00:03:30,585 --> 00:03:33,034
I'm going left,
if you don't like it, get out and walk!

53
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:37,326
If you turn right, you'll have a career.
Not just filling-in.

54
00:03:37,582 --> 00:03:38,958
You think I'm so useless.

55
00:03:39,058 --> 00:03:42,387
Oh, I know why you want
a job with HC Clements, lady.

56
00:03:42,487 --> 00:03:44,108
Cos you think you'll meet a man

57
00:03:44,208 --> 00:03:46,967
with lots of money and your
whole life will change.

58
00:03:47,067 --> 00:03:48,506
Well, let me tell you, sweetheart,

59
00:03:48,606 --> 00:03:52,492
City executives don't need temps.
Except for practice.

60
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,650
Yeah, well, they haven't met me!

61
00:03:59,143 --> 00:04:00,350
You turned left.

62
00:04:02,152 --> 00:04:04,867
<i>What if you'd turned right?
What then?</i>

63
00:04:05,931 --> 00:04:08,190
- Let go of my hands.
- What if it changes?

64
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:12,253
What if you go right?
What if you could still go right?

65
00:04:17,508 --> 00:04:18,378
Stop it!

66
00:04:21,314 --> 00:04:22,196
What's that?!

67
00:04:23,178 --> 00:04:24,092
What's on my back?

68
00:04:25,049 --> 00:04:25,950
What is it?

69
00:04:26,688 --> 00:04:27,552
What's on my back?

70
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:30,212
<i>Make the choice again, Donna Noble,</i>

71
00:04:30,312 --> 00:04:33,890
and change your mind. Turn right!

72
00:04:38,437 --> 00:04:39,730
I'm turning.

73
00:04:41,265 --> 00:04:43,048
Turn right.

74
00:04:44,105 --> 00:04:45,690
<i>Turn right!</i>

75
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:47,515
Turn RIGHT!

76
00:04:48,903 --> 00:04:52,958
Let me tell you, sweetheart,
City executives don't need temps.

77
00:04:53,058 --> 00:04:54,810
Except for practice.

78
00:04:55,354 --> 00:04:56,444
Yeah.

79
00:04:56,912 --> 00:04:58,226
Suppose you're right.

80
00:04:58,326 --> 00:05:02,193
<i>Turn right, and never meet that man.</i>

81
00:05:02,531 --> 00:05:06,229
<i>Turn right and change the world!</i>

82
00:05:30,434 --> 00:05:33,730

# We wish you a merry Christmas
We wish you a merry Christmas #

87
00:05:48,896 --> 00:05:52,715
# We wish you a merry Christmas
and a happy New Year... #

88
00:05:52,815 --> 00:05:54,168
Get out of the way!

89
00:05:57,072 --> 00:05:59,675
Here we are! Feed at the trough!

90
00:05:59,775 --> 00:06:01,373
Mooky says, let's go to the Boardwalk,

91
00:06:01,473 --> 00:06:04,048
- it's 2 for the price of 1.
- Christmas Eve? It'll be heaving!

92
00:06:04,148 --> 00:06:06,720
Well, exactly! Get in and grab 'em!

93
00:06:07,331 --> 00:06:10,395
That's the second round of drinks
you've bought, it was my turn.

94
00:06:10,704 --> 00:06:12,800
I can afford it. Promotion!

95
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:18,555
You are talking to Jival Chowdry's
Personal Assistant, I'll have you know.

96
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:22,992
Capital P, capital A,
£23,000 per annum, merci beaucoup!

97
00:06:23,092 --> 00:06:26,161
- Here's to Mr Chowdry!
- Mr Chowdry!

98
00:06:26,633 --> 00:06:28,106
<i>She gets all the luck.</i>

99
00:06:29,143 --> 00:06:31,703
What's wrong? What is it?

100
00:06:32,526 --> 00:06:33,105
Sorry?

101
00:06:33,205 --> 00:06:34,492
Someone spill a drink on me?

102
00:06:34,592 --> 00:06:35,107
No.

103
00:06:35,908 --> 00:06:39,007
Why d'you keep looking
at my shoulder, what's wrong?

104
00:06:39,243 --> 00:06:39,908
I don't know.

105
00:06:40,008 --> 00:06:42,118
Oh, don't tell me you're
getting all spooky again.

106
00:06:42,218 --> 00:06:45,580
It was bad enough when you saw the ghost
of Earl Mountbatten at the Boat Show.

107
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,031
What're you looking at?

108
00:06:47,131 --> 00:06:49,021
- What is it?
- It's like...

109
00:06:50,279 --> 00:06:52,431
It's like there's something I can't see.

110
00:06:52,862 --> 00:06:54,960
<i>No, shut up all of you!</i>

111
00:06:55,137 --> 00:06:57,411
<i>Come and see.
Just look at the sky!</i>

112
00:06:57,589 --> 00:07:00,054
It's a star! It's a Christmas star!

113
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,262
Come on, then.

114
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:10,422
What the hell is that?!
Ken Livingston, that's what!

115
00:07:10,522 --> 00:07:13,469
- Spending our money on decorations!
- How much did that cost?!

116
00:07:13,569 --> 00:07:16,660
Don't be so stupid,
it's flying, it's really flying!

117
00:07:21,549 --> 00:07:23,079
That's not a star,

118
00:07:23,273 --> 00:07:24,588
<i>that's a web.</i>

119
00:07:25,582 --> 00:07:28,271
It's heading east,
the middle of the city.

120
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:49,641
Alice, there's a great big
web star thing shooting at people

121
00:07:49,741 --> 00:07:51,220
and you're looking at ME!

122
00:07:52,287 --> 00:07:54,890
There's something on your back!

123
00:07:59,801 --> 00:08:01,846
Donna! Where you going?!

124
00:08:02,197 --> 00:08:05,365
You'll get yourself killed! Donna!!

125
00:08:10,072 --> 00:08:11,123
Fire!

126
00:08:17,704 --> 00:08:20,765
<i>Everyone stay back!
The Thames has been closed.</i>

127
00:08:21,523 --> 00:08:22,810
<i>Return to your homes.</i>

128
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:25,635
<i>Keep away from the river,
and that's an order.</i>

129
00:08:27,893 --> 00:08:31,504
<i>Trap 1 to Greyhound 15,
what is your report? Over.</i>

130
00:08:31,755 --> 00:08:34,251
From the evidence I'd say
he managed to stop a creature,

131
00:08:34,472 --> 00:08:35,924
some sort of red spider.

132
00:08:36,348 --> 00:08:39,253
<i>Blew up the base underneath the barrier,
flooded the whole thing. Over.</i>

133
00:08:39,353 --> 00:08:41,620
<i>And where is he now? Over.</i>

134
00:08:42,899 --> 00:08:45,432
We've found a body, sir. Over.

135
00:08:45,974 --> 00:08:48,507
- Is it him? Over.
- I think so.

136
00:08:48,817 --> 00:08:50,488
<i>Just didn't make it out in time.</i>

137
00:08:55,737 --> 00:08:56,946
The Doctor is dead.

138
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:59,835
<i>It must have happened
too fast for him to regenerate.</i>

139
00:09:06,415 --> 00:09:08,189
<i>Escort the ambulance back to unit base.</i>

140
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:22,970
What happened, what did they find?
Did they find someone?

141
00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:26,555
I don't know.
Bloke called the Doctor or something.

142
00:09:26,655 --> 00:09:27,720
Where is he?

143
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:29,858
They took him away. He's dead.

144
00:09:32,898 --> 00:09:34,494
I'm sorry. Did you know him?

145
00:09:35,624 --> 00:09:38,406
I mean, they didn't say his name.

146
00:09:39,064 --> 00:09:40,473
It could be any doctor.

147
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:43,620
I came so far.

148
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:47,521
It could be anyone.

149
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,971
- What's your name?
- Donna.

150
00:09:53,614 --> 00:09:56,104
- And you?
- Oh, I was just...

151
00:09:56,740 --> 00:09:59,100
passing by, I shouldn't even be here.

152
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:02,611
This is wrong. This is wrong.
This is so wrong.

153
00:10:04,990 --> 00:10:08,323
- Sorry, what was it, Donna what?
- Why d'you keep looking at my back?

154
00:10:08,423 --> 00:10:09,624
- I'm not.
- Yes, you are.

155
00:10:09,724 --> 00:10:11,880
You keep looking behind me,
you're doing it now.

156
00:10:12,242 --> 00:10:15,095
What is it, what's there?
Has someone put something on my back?

157
00:10:26,479 --> 00:10:30,530
You can't sack me!
I'm your Personal Assistant!

158
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:34,509
You don't have to make a scene,
just come downstairs, and we can talk.

159
00:10:34,609 --> 00:10:36,781
Oh, I'll make a scene,
right in front of a tribunal.

160
00:10:36,881 --> 00:10:38,956
And the first thing I'll say is
"wandering hands"!

161
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:41,312
You know what it's been like
for the past few months,

162
00:10:41,412 --> 00:10:42,706
ever since that Christmas thing.

163
00:10:42,806 --> 00:10:45,023
Half my contracts were on
the other side of the river,

164
00:10:45,123 --> 00:10:46,697
and the Thames is still closed off.

165
00:10:46,797 --> 00:10:49,028
Look, I can't deliver,
I'm losing a fortune.

166
00:10:49,128 --> 00:10:50,443
Well, sack one of this lot!

167
00:10:50,543 --> 00:10:53,561
Sack Cliff! He just sits there,
I don't know what he does all day.

168
00:10:53,661 --> 00:10:54,448
Sorry, Cliff.

169
00:10:54,548 --> 00:10:57,370
Actually, I'm not sorry,
what DO you do all day?

170
00:10:58,510 --> 00:10:59,540
What the hell?!

171
00:11:05,611 --> 00:11:06,862
Like an earthquake.

172
00:11:07,849 --> 00:11:08,886
That's weird.

173
00:11:09,545 --> 00:11:11,169
Funny sort of clouds...

174
00:11:12,291 --> 00:11:13,300
Who typed this?

175
00:11:13,607 --> 00:11:17,612
I'm your PA, did you get
someone else to type this?

176
00:11:20,129 --> 00:11:21,290
Beatrice!

177
00:11:22,716 --> 00:11:26,292
It sounds impossible,
but the entire hospital has vanished.

178
00:11:26,392 --> 00:11:28,402
<i>The Royal Hope no longer exists.</i>

179
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:30,776
<i>It's not been destroyed,
there's no wreckage,</i>

180
00:11:30,876 --> 00:11:32,125
<i>it's simply gone.</i>

181
00:11:32,318 --> 00:11:36,974
Reports from bystanders say that
the rain lifted up around the hospital.

182
00:11:37,288 --> 00:11:40,435
Hole punch, having that.
Stapler, mine.

183
00:11:40,535 --> 00:11:43,484
Toy cactus,
you can have that, Beatrice, catch!

184
00:11:43,955 --> 00:11:46,851
Cliff, I'd leave you my mousemat,
but I'm worried you'd cut yourself.

185
00:11:46,951 --> 00:11:48,432
All right, Donna, have some respect.

186
00:11:48,532 --> 00:11:51,115
There's 2,000 people in that hospital.
And it's vanished!

187
00:11:51,215 --> 00:11:54,130
I'll show you vanishing.
Thanks for nothing!

188
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:57,416
Oh, and you know when that
money went missing from the kitty?

189
00:11:57,773 --> 00:12:00,003
Anne Marie. That's all I'm saying.

190
00:12:00,239 --> 00:12:01,884
Anne Marie!

191
00:12:04,301 --> 00:12:06,532
Oh, don't tell me,
the hospital's back!

192
00:12:06,975 --> 00:12:08,885
Well, isn't that wizard?!

193
00:12:10,008 --> 00:12:14,163
To confirm. The Royal Hope Hospital
was returned to its original position.

194
00:12:14,263 --> 00:12:15,831
But with only one survivor.

195
00:12:16,496 --> 00:12:19,873
The only person left alive,
is medical student Oliver Morgenstern.

196
00:12:19,973 --> 00:12:21,939
And there were these creatures.

197
00:12:22,411 --> 00:12:25,555
Like rhinos.
Talking rhinos in black leather...

198
00:12:25,655 --> 00:12:26,635
Rhinos?

199
00:12:26,735 --> 00:12:28,738
Rhinos, could be aliens.

200
00:12:29,639 --> 00:12:32,607
<i>We couldn't breathe,
we were running out of air.</i>

201
00:12:32,707 --> 00:12:36,752
A colleague of mine gave
me the last oxygen tank. Martha.

202
00:12:37,095 --> 00:12:38,419
Martha Jones.

203
00:12:39,391 --> 00:12:40,943
And she died.

204
00:12:41,816 --> 00:12:44,010
Least you've got a hole punch.

205
00:12:44,539 --> 00:12:45,798
And a raffle ticket.

206
00:12:45,898 --> 00:12:49,366
Yeah, well, they can keep the raffle,
I wouldn't take a penny off that man.

207
00:12:49,466 --> 00:12:51,998
Honestly, you two!
There's aliens on the news!

208
00:12:52,098 --> 00:12:54,153
They took that hospital
all the way to the moon,

209
00:12:54,253 --> 00:12:56,048
and you're banging on
about raffle tickets!

210
00:12:56,148 --> 00:12:59,551
Don't be daft, Gramps,
it wasn't the moon, it couldn't be.

211
00:12:59,651 --> 00:13:02,640
I am telling you, it is getting worse,
these past few years.

212
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:04,235
It's like all of a sudden,

213
00:13:04,335 --> 00:13:07,598
they suddenly know all about us
and there's keen eyes up there

214
00:13:07,698 --> 00:13:09,772
and they're watching us,
and they're not friendly.

215
00:13:09,872 --> 00:13:11,425
This stapler says Bea.

216
00:13:11,525 --> 00:13:13,777
Can't believe how well you're taking
me getting sacked.

217
00:13:13,877 --> 00:13:15,021
Thought you'd hit the roof.

218
00:13:15,121 --> 00:13:16,172
I'm just tired, Donna.

219
00:13:16,272 --> 00:13:17,939
What with your father and everything.

220
00:13:18,783 --> 00:13:21,130
To be honest, I've given up on you.

221
00:13:21,230 --> 00:13:23,381
<i>This further report just in
from Oliver Morgenstern.</i>

222
00:13:23,481 --> 00:13:25,075
There was this woman
who took control.

223
00:13:25,175 --> 00:13:28,994
Said she knew what to do, said she
could stop the MRI or something.

224
00:13:29,094 --> 00:13:32,221
Sarah Jane, her name was.
Sarah Jane Smith.

225
00:13:32,393 --> 00:13:35,420
Sarah Jane Smith was
a freelance investigative journalist,

226
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:37,851
<i>formerly of Metropolitan Magazine.</i>

227
00:13:37,951 --> 00:13:41,370
<i>Her body was recovered from
the hospital late this afternoon...</i>

228
00:13:41,885 --> 00:13:44,490
- What's for tea?
- I've got nothing in.

229
00:13:45,410 --> 00:13:46,412
I'll get chips.

230
00:13:46,898 --> 00:13:49,950
Last of my wages.
Fish and chips, yeah?

231
00:13:50,050 --> 00:13:53,840
<i>Along with his teenage friends
Maria Jackson and Clyde Langer.</i>

232
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:56,393
<i>It is feared that they also perished.</i>

233
00:14:24,957 --> 00:14:26,931
Blimey, you all right?!

234
00:14:28,325 --> 00:14:31,242
- What was that, fireworks, or...?
- I dunno. I was just...

235
00:14:31,614 --> 00:14:33,237
walking along. That's weird!

236
00:14:35,668 --> 00:14:36,755
You're the one...

237
00:14:37,814 --> 00:14:39,650
Christmas Eve, I met you, in town.

238
00:14:40,255 --> 00:14:42,664
- Donna, isn't it?
- What was your name?

239
00:14:43,015 --> 00:14:44,595
How're you doing?
You're looking good.

240
00:14:44,781 --> 00:14:46,190
What you been up to?

241
00:14:46,662 --> 00:14:48,774
- You're doing it again.
- What?

242
00:14:49,253 --> 00:14:50,610
Looking behind me.

243
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:52,560
People keep on doing that.

244
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:55,188
- Looking at my back.
- What sort of people?

245
00:14:56,003 --> 00:14:57,150
People in the street.

246
00:14:57,455 --> 00:14:58,380
Strangers.

247
00:14:58,870 --> 00:15:00,382
I just catch them, sometimes.

248
00:15:00,482 --> 00:15:01,734
Staring at me.

249
00:15:02,656 --> 00:15:04,251
Like they're looking at something.

250
00:15:04,451 --> 00:15:07,749
And then I get home and
I look and there's nothing there.

251
00:15:10,481 --> 00:15:13,256
- See? Look, now I'M doing it!
- What are you doing for Christmas?

252
00:15:13,578 --> 00:15:14,786
What am I what?!

253
00:15:14,886 --> 00:15:17,096
Next Christmas. Any plans?

254
00:15:17,439 --> 00:15:18,984
I dunno, that's ages away!

255
00:15:19,084 --> 00:15:21,372
Nothing much, I suppose. Why?

256
00:15:22,209 --> 00:15:24,050
Just, I think you should get out,

257
00:15:24,319 --> 00:15:27,250
you and your family. Don't stay
in London. Just leave the city.

258
00:15:28,323 --> 00:15:29,246
What for?

259
00:15:29,346 --> 00:15:31,691
Nice hotel. Christmas break?

260
00:15:32,492 --> 00:15:33,322
Can't afford it.

261
00:15:33,422 --> 00:15:35,305
Well, now,
you've got that raffle ticket.

262
00:15:36,463 --> 00:15:38,537
- How d'you know about that?
- First prize.

263
00:15:39,588 --> 00:15:40,968
Luxury weekend break.

264
00:15:41,169 --> 00:15:43,130
Use it, Donna Noble.

265
00:15:43,830 --> 00:15:46,130
Why won't you tell me your name?

266
00:15:50,581 --> 00:15:52,541
I think you

267
00:15:53,191 --> 00:15:54,607
should leave me alone.

268
00:16:05,465 --> 00:16:09,241
# Merry Xmas Everybody #
by Slade

269
00:16:11,043 --> 00:16:13,890
<i>Cor blimey! That's what I call posh!</i>

270
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:17,315
I said you were lucky!
Didn't I always say, my lucky star?

271
00:16:18,810 --> 00:16:21,921
For God's sake, don't tell them
that we won it in a raffle. Be classy!

272
00:16:22,021 --> 00:16:24,824
- Dad, take those things off.
- No, I shan't, it's Christmas!

273
00:16:24,924 --> 00:16:27,527
I'll have that one, thank you,
it's got my liniment in it.

274
00:16:27,627 --> 00:16:29,329
I reckon we deserve this.

275
00:16:30,159 --> 00:16:31,568
It's been a hell of a year.

276
00:16:31,668 --> 00:16:33,599
Your Dad would've loved this.

277
00:16:34,417 --> 00:16:35,081
Yeah.

278
00:16:36,157 --> 00:16:37,223
He would've.

279
00:16:45,647 --> 00:16:48,650
<i>Oy! Gramps!
Get that, that'll be breakfast!</i>

280
00:16:48,910 --> 00:16:50,330
We've got croissants!

281
00:16:50,691 --> 00:16:52,570
Why can't you get it? Lady Muck!

282
00:16:52,830 --> 00:16:55,132
It's Christmas Day,
I never get up before ten.

283
00:16:55,568 --> 00:16:58,115
Only madam there
was up with the dawn chorus.

284
00:16:58,215 --> 00:17:00,075
<i>Like when she was six years old!</i>

285
00:17:00,175 --> 00:17:02,485
I'm not wasting a second in this place!

286
00:17:03,228 --> 00:17:06,530
- How was the sofa?
- Oh, yeah, not so good, really.

287
00:17:09,766 --> 00:17:12,126
You know we could've paid
for a second room.

288
00:17:13,018 --> 00:17:13,737
Oi!

289
00:17:14,892 --> 00:17:17,295
- Merry Christmas!
- Merry Christmas.

290
00:17:17,395 --> 00:17:18,889
Merry Christmas, Dad.

291
00:17:19,149 --> 00:17:23,416
All right! All right, my darlin'!
Grub's up! Merry Christmas!

292
00:17:23,516 --> 00:17:24,533
Merry Christmas, sir.

293
00:17:25,942 --> 00:17:26,936
Have you seen this?

294
00:17:27,036 --> 00:17:29,010
Nice early breakfast,
then we'll go for a walk.

295
00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:30,834
People always say that at Christmas,

296
00:17:30,934 --> 00:17:33,408
"Oh, we all went for a walk"
I've always wanted to do that.

297
00:17:33,508 --> 00:17:36,550
So, walk first, presents later, yeah?

298
00:17:36,650 --> 00:17:37,644
Donna, come and see.

299
00:17:37,744 --> 00:17:39,590
Tienes algo en tu espalda.

300
00:17:39,869 --> 00:17:41,049
- What?
- Look at the telly.

301
00:17:41,149 --> 00:17:42,607
Tienes algo en tu espalda.

302
00:17:42,707 --> 00:17:44,739
What does it mean?
Don't know what you're saying.

303
00:17:44,839 --> 00:17:48,028
- Donna, look at the TV!
- Tienes algo en tu espalda!

304
00:17:55,492 --> 00:17:58,238
For God's sake, Donna,
don't just stand there, come and look!

305
00:17:59,111 --> 00:18:04,736
<i>This footage is live and genuine.
The object is falling on Central London.</i>

306
00:18:04,836 --> 00:18:08,133
I repeat, this is not a hoax.
A replica of the Titanic

307
00:18:08,233 --> 00:18:11,935
is falling out of the sky and
it's heading for Buckingham Palace.

308
00:18:12,364 --> 00:18:15,572
<i>We're getting this footage from
the Guinnevere range of satellites.</i>

309
00:18:15,895 --> 00:18:17,982
Is that... a film or something?

310
00:18:20,467 --> 00:18:23,077
<i>The Royal Air Force
has declared an emerg...</i>

311
00:18:33,501 --> 00:18:34,752
It's gone dead.

312
00:18:35,646 --> 00:18:36,412
All of them.

313
00:18:36,512 --> 00:18:39,525
No, but the Titanic?!
Oh, don't be daft!

314
00:18:40,983 --> 00:18:42,414
Is that like a sequel?

315
00:18:43,501 --> 00:18:44,170
Oh...

316
00:18:46,097 --> 00:18:48,037
Oh, God rest their souls.

317
00:18:54,023 --> 00:18:56,068
<i>I was supposed to be out there,
selling papers.</i>

318
00:18:56,168 --> 00:18:57,807
I should've been there.
We all should.

319
00:18:58,451 --> 00:18:59,580
We'd be dead.

320
00:19:00,492 --> 00:19:01,812
That's everyone.

321
00:19:02,627 --> 00:19:04,987
Every single person we know.

322
00:19:05,409 --> 00:19:06,639
The whole city.

323
00:19:08,055 --> 00:19:09,020
Can't be.

324
00:19:09,685 --> 00:19:11,165
But it is. It's gone.

325
00:19:12,288 --> 00:19:13,539
London's gone.

326
00:19:14,719 --> 00:19:16,810
If you hadn't won that raffle...

327
00:19:23,710 --> 00:19:26,761
Leeds?! I'm not moving to Leeds!

328
00:19:26,861 --> 00:19:28,191
I'm afraid it's Leeds,

329
00:19:28,291 --> 00:19:30,906
or you can wait in the hostel
for another three months.

330
00:19:31,006 --> 00:19:32,437
All I want is a washing machine.

331
00:19:32,537 --> 00:19:35,010
What about Glasgow,
I heard there was jobs going in Glasgow.

332
00:19:35,110 --> 00:19:36,227
You can't pick and choose!

333
00:19:36,327 --> 00:19:39,023
All of Southern England's
flooded with radiation,

334
00:19:39,123 --> 00:19:41,760
7 million people in need of relocation,

335
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:46,528
and now France has closed its borders,
so it's Leeds or nothing. Next!

336
00:19:59,450 --> 00:20:02,344
<i>The Daniels Family,
billetted at number 15.</i>

337
00:20:02,444 --> 00:20:05,583
Mr & Mrs Obego, billetted at number 31.

338
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:08,265
<i>Miss Coltrane, you're in number 8.</i>

339
00:20:08,365 --> 00:20:10,770
The Noble family,
billetted at number 29...

340
00:20:10,870 --> 00:20:12,810
That's us! Come on. Off we go.

341
00:20:14,024 --> 00:20:14,760
All right?

342
00:20:16,870 --> 00:20:19,446
Used to be a nice little family,
number 29.

343
00:20:19,546 --> 00:20:21,778
They missed one mortgage
payment, just one,

344
00:20:21,878 --> 00:20:24,259
they got booted out, all for you lot.

345
00:20:24,359 --> 00:20:27,020
Don't get all chippy
with me, Vera Duckworth.

346
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:29,808
Pop your clogs on and go
and feed t'whippets.

347
00:20:29,908 --> 00:20:30,873
Sweetheart, come on.

348
00:20:30,973 --> 00:20:34,105
You're not gonna make the
world any better by shouting at it.

349
00:20:34,899 --> 00:20:36,108
I can try.

350
00:20:42,414 --> 00:20:44,252
What happens, do we get keys?

351
00:20:44,352 --> 00:20:47,127
- I don't know, do I?
- Who do we ask, the soldiers?

352
00:20:48,186 --> 00:20:50,844
Hey-ey! Is a big house!

353
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:54,320
Room for all! Welcome! In you come.

354
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:58,432
- I thought this was OUR house.
- Is many people's house! Is wonderful!

355
00:20:58,532 --> 00:20:59,760
In! In! In!

356
00:21:00,911 --> 00:21:02,835
<i>We've been here
for eight weeks already.</i>

357
00:21:02,935 --> 00:21:06,539
<i>I had a nice little paper shop
in Shepherd's Bush. All gone now.</i>

358
00:21:06,639 --> 00:21:10,357
So, upstairs, we have the
Merchandani family, seven of them,

359
00:21:10,457 --> 00:21:12,269
good family, good kids.

360
00:21:12,734 --> 00:21:15,401
Except that one, be careful of him.

361
00:21:16,059 --> 00:21:20,422
That's a joking! Where's that smile?

362
00:21:21,079 --> 00:21:24,312
Rocco Colosanto,
I'm here with my wife, and her sister,

363
00:21:24,412 --> 00:21:26,551
her husband, their kids,
and their daughter's kids.

364
00:21:26,651 --> 00:21:27,753
We've got the front room.

365
00:21:27,853 --> 00:21:31,515
My mother, she's got the back room.
She's old, you forgive.

366
00:21:31,908 --> 00:21:37,140
And this, this is you,
this is your palace!

367
00:21:40,126 --> 00:21:42,490
- What d'you mean, this is us?
- You live here!

368
00:21:43,429 --> 00:21:45,495
- We living in the kitchen?!
- You got camp beds!

369
00:21:45,595 --> 00:21:48,435
You got the cooker, you keep warm,
you got the fridge, you keep cool!

370
00:21:48,535 --> 00:21:50,331
- Is good!
- What about the bathroom?

371
00:21:50,431 --> 00:21:53,835
- Nobody lives in the bathroom!
- No, I mean, is there a rota?

372
00:21:53,935 --> 00:21:56,481
Is pot luck! Is fun!

373
00:21:56,703 --> 00:21:59,577
I go wake Mamma,
she likes new people.

374
00:21:59,677 --> 00:22:02,770
Mamma! Is people! Nice people!

375
00:22:05,242 --> 00:22:06,266
Ah, well...

376
00:22:07,210 --> 00:22:09,477
We'll settle in, won't we? Make do.

377
00:22:09,942 --> 00:22:11,909
Bit of wartime spirit, eh?

378
00:22:12,238 --> 00:22:15,038
But there isn't a war.
There's no fight,

379
00:22:15,989 --> 00:22:17,069
There's just...

380
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:18,794
this.

381
00:22:19,357 --> 00:22:20,898
Well, America, they'll save us.

382
00:22:20,998 --> 00:22:22,089
It was on the news.

383
00:22:22,189 --> 00:22:26,774
They're gonna send Great Britain
50 billion quid in financial aid!

384
00:22:27,215 --> 00:22:28,584
God bless America!

385
00:22:28,684 --> 00:22:33,040
America is in crisis with
over 60 million reported dead.

386
00:22:33,550 --> 00:22:38,126
Sixty million people have dissolved
into fat. And the fat is walking.

387
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:41,743
<i>People's fat has come to life
and is walking through the streets.</i>

388
00:22:42,279 --> 00:22:44,095
<i>And there are spaceships.</i>

389
00:22:44,195 --> 00:22:48,030
<i>There are reports of spaceships
over every major US city.</i>

390
00:22:48,130 --> 00:22:49,589
<i>The fat is flying...</i>

391
00:22:49,689 --> 00:22:50,690
Aliens.

392
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:52,698
Yeah.

393
00:22:52,864 --> 00:22:53,980
<i>...into the air.</i>

394
00:22:55,933 --> 00:22:59,279
Mary McGinty, d'you remember her?

395
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:00,996
Who was she?

396
00:23:01,410 --> 00:23:04,021
Worked in the newsagent on a Sunday.

397
00:23:04,977 --> 00:23:06,851
Little woman, black hair.

398
00:23:07,966 --> 00:23:09,454
Never really spoke to her.

399
00:23:09,997 --> 00:23:10,991
She'll be dead.

400
00:23:11,778 --> 00:23:13,659
<i>Every day, I think of someone else.</i>

401
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:15,243
<i>All dead.</i>

402
00:23:15,694 --> 00:23:17,560
Maybe she went away for Christmas.

403
00:23:18,046 --> 00:23:18,905
Maybe.

404
00:23:20,907 --> 00:23:24,125
I'll go out tomorrow,
I'll walk into town.

405
00:23:24,669 --> 00:23:25,937
There's got to be work.

406
00:23:26,215 --> 00:23:28,089
Everyone needs secretaries.

407
00:23:28,482 --> 00:23:31,370
Soon as I'm earning,
we'll get a proper place.

408
00:23:31,972 --> 00:23:33,202
Just you wait, Mum.

409
00:23:33,803 --> 00:23:35,330
What if it never gets better?

410
00:23:35,801 --> 00:23:37,010
Course it will.

411
00:23:37,353 --> 00:23:38,926
<i>Even the bees are disappearing.</i>

412
00:23:39,026 --> 00:23:41,014
You don't see bumble bees any more.

413
00:23:41,172 --> 00:23:42,430
They'll sort us out,

414
00:23:43,875 --> 00:23:45,164
the Emergency Government.

415
00:23:46,044 --> 00:23:48,075
- They'll do something.
- What if they don't?

416
00:23:49,598 --> 00:23:50,613
Then...

417
00:23:51,908 --> 00:23:53,109
we'll complain.

418
00:23:53,209 --> 00:23:54,570
Who's gonna listen to us?

419
00:23:55,121 --> 00:23:56,444
Refugees.

420
00:23:57,109 --> 00:23:58,640
We haven't even got a vote.

421
00:23:59,415 --> 00:24:01,035
We're just no-one, Donna.

422
00:24:01,815 --> 00:24:03,274
We don't exist.

423
00:24:03,889 --> 00:24:07,065
# ..And I spent all my
money on whisky and beer.. #

424
00:24:07,165 --> 00:24:10,190
I am going to kill that man!

425
00:24:12,872 --> 00:24:15,200
Now, listen, Mussolini!

426
00:24:16,215 --> 00:24:19,982
I am telling you, for the last time,
to button it!

427
00:24:20,318 --> 00:24:23,402
If I hear one more sea shanty...

428
00:24:26,630 --> 00:24:29,090
Always loved a sing-song.

429
00:24:29,538 --> 00:24:32,393
# ..I'm just a poor boy,
nobody loves me

430
00:24:32,493 --> 00:24:35,339
# He's just a poor boy
from a poor family

431
00:24:35,439 --> 00:24:38,329
# Spare him his life
from this monstrosity

432
00:24:39,773 --> 00:24:41,070
# Easy come, easy go

433
00:24:41,170 --> 00:24:43,300
# Will you let me go...? #

434
00:24:46,104 --> 00:24:47,985
You stay here!

435
00:24:48,828 --> 00:24:49,930
Everyone, stay!

436
00:24:52,707 --> 00:24:55,575
Hey! Firing at the car, is not so good!

437
00:24:55,675 --> 00:24:57,306
You crazy or what?!

438
00:24:57,470 --> 00:24:59,037
It's this ATMOS thing, it won't stop,

439
00:24:59,137 --> 00:25:00,245
it's like gas, it's toxic.

440
00:25:00,345 --> 00:25:01,394
Well, switch it off!

441
00:25:01,494 --> 00:25:03,747
I have done! It's still going!
It's all the cars,

442
00:25:03,847 --> 00:25:06,443
every single ATMOS car!
They've gone mad...

443
00:25:08,631 --> 00:25:10,290
You... lady, turn round.

444
00:25:10,671 --> 00:25:12,180
- Turn around!
- Are you crazy, boy?

445
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:12,680
Now!

446
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:14,962
- Put that down!
- Turn round!

447
00:25:16,030 --> 00:25:17,064
Do what he says!

448
00:25:17,190 --> 00:25:18,902
Show me your back! Turn around!

449
00:25:19,681 --> 00:25:21,004
<i>Show me your back!</i>

450
00:25:26,668 --> 00:25:27,264
Sorry.

451
00:25:27,644 --> 00:25:28,602
I thought I saw...

452
00:25:28,702 --> 00:25:32,759
Call yourself a soldier?!
Pointing guns at innocent women!

453
00:25:32,859 --> 00:25:34,040
<i>You're a disgrace!</i>

454
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:36,450
<i>In my day, we'd have
had you court-martialled!</i>

455
00:25:36,899 --> 00:25:40,589
Donna, where are you going?
It's not safe at night!

456
00:25:40,796 --> 00:25:42,810
Donna! Donna!

457
00:25:47,756 --> 00:25:48,385
Hello.

458
00:25:50,161 --> 00:25:50,843
Hi.

459
00:25:51,539 --> 00:25:53,191
It's the ATMOS devices.

460
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:57,074
We're lucky, it's not so bad here,
Britain hasn't got that much petrol.

461
00:25:57,174 --> 00:25:58,550
But all over Europe...

462
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:01,532
China, South Africa...

463
00:26:02,133 --> 00:26:04,000
They're getting choked by gas.

464
00:26:04,894 --> 00:26:06,252
Can't anyone stop it?

465
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:08,443
Yeah, they're trying right now.

466
00:26:08,543 --> 00:26:12,298
This little band of fighters,
on board the Sontaran ship.

467
00:26:13,814 --> 00:26:15,265
Any second now.

468
00:26:30,296 --> 00:26:31,576
And that was...?

469
00:26:32,358 --> 00:26:33,691
That was the Torchwood team.

470
00:26:34,448 --> 00:26:35,724
Gwen Cooper,

471
00:26:36,095 --> 00:26:38,108
Ianto Jones, they gave their lives.

472
00:26:39,029 --> 00:26:42,589
And Captain Jack Harkness has
transported to the Sontaran homeworld.

473
00:26:42,808 --> 00:26:43,980
There's no-one left.

474
00:26:47,012 --> 00:26:48,801
You're always wearing
the same clothes.

475
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:51,216
Why won't you tell me your name?

476
00:26:51,316 --> 00:26:53,894
None of this was meant to happen.

477
00:26:55,182 --> 00:26:56,215
There was a man.

478
00:26:57,435 --> 00:27:00,108
This wonderful man.
And he stopped it.

479
00:27:00,327 --> 00:27:04,488
The Titanic, the Adipose, the ATMOS,
he stopped them all from happening.

480
00:27:04,682 --> 00:27:06,250
That... Doctor?

481
00:27:06,965 --> 00:27:08,812
- You knew him.
- Did I?

482
00:27:10,218 --> 00:27:10,764
When?

483
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:14,387
I think you dream about him sometimes.
It's a man in a suit.

484
00:27:14,631 --> 00:27:17,484
Tall, thin man. Great hair.

485
00:27:18,141 --> 00:27:20,575
Some really great hair.

486
00:27:21,707 --> 00:27:22,933
Who are you?

487
00:27:23,309 --> 00:27:25,724
I was like you. I used to be you.

488
00:27:25,875 --> 00:27:27,570
Cos you travelled with him, Donna,

489
00:27:27,732 --> 00:27:29,836
you travelled with the Doctor
in a different world.

490
00:27:29,936 --> 00:27:32,126
I never met him. And he's dead.

491
00:27:32,226 --> 00:27:33,754
He died underneath the Thames

492
00:27:33,854 --> 00:27:35,862
on Christmas Eve.
But you were meant to be there.

493
00:27:35,962 --> 00:27:38,915
He needed someone to stop him,
and that was you. You made him leave.

494
00:27:39,472 --> 00:27:40,711
You saved his life.

495
00:27:48,795 --> 00:27:51,510
Doctor! You can stop now!

496
00:27:52,750 --> 00:27:55,395
Stop it! I don't know what you're
talking about, leave me alone!

497
00:27:55,495 --> 00:27:58,126
Something's coming, Donna.
Something worse.

498
00:27:58,415 --> 00:28:00,927
The whole world is stinking.

499
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:03,705
How could anything be worse than this?

500
00:28:03,805 --> 00:28:06,570
Trust me. We need the Doctor
more than ever. I've...

501
00:28:07,492 --> 00:28:09,933
I've been pulled across
from a different universe,

502
00:28:10,033 --> 00:28:12,015
because every single
universe is in danger.

503
00:28:12,347 --> 00:28:13,890
It's coming, Donna.

504
00:28:14,150 --> 00:28:17,593
<i>It's coming from across the stars,
and nothing can stop it.</i>

505
00:28:17,693 --> 00:28:18,770
What is?

506
00:28:19,796 --> 00:28:20,903
The darkness.

507
00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:27,435
Well, what d'you keep telling me for?
What am I supposed to do?!

508
00:28:27,854 --> 00:28:28,980
I'm nothing special.

509
00:28:29,224 --> 00:28:33,389
I mean... I'm not...
I'm nothing special. I'm a temp!

510
00:28:33,787 --> 00:28:36,050
I'm not even that! I'm nothing.

511
00:28:36,202 --> 00:28:40,290
Donna Noble, you're the most important
woman in the whole of creation.

512
00:28:41,814 --> 00:28:42,915
Oh, don't.

513
00:28:43,908 --> 00:28:46,127
Just... don't.

514
00:28:48,154 --> 00:28:49,290
I'm tired.

515
00:28:50,817 --> 00:28:53,301
I'm so tired.

516
00:28:55,188 --> 00:28:56,840
I need you to come with me.

517
00:28:57,684 --> 00:28:59,480
Yeah, well,

518
00:29:00,512 --> 00:29:03,492
blonde hair might work on the men,
but you ain't shifting me, lady!

519
00:29:03,592 --> 00:29:04,844
That's more like it.

520
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:08,266
- I've got plenty more.
- You'll come with me.

521
00:29:09,461 --> 00:29:10,787
Only when you want to.

522
00:29:11,285 --> 00:29:12,492
You'll have a long wait, then.

523
00:29:12,592 --> 00:29:13,631
Not really, just 3 weeks.

524
00:29:13,731 --> 00:29:16,315
Tell me, does your grandfather
still own that telescope?

525
00:29:18,893 --> 00:29:20,125
He never lets go of it.

526
00:29:20,563 --> 00:29:21,728
Three weeks' time.

527
00:29:23,311 --> 00:29:24,781
But you've got to be certain.

528
00:29:25,126 --> 00:29:27,466
Cos when you come with me,
Donna... I'm sorry,

529
00:29:28,266 --> 00:29:29,399
so sorry, but...

530
00:29:31,666 --> 00:29:32,986
you're going to die.

531
00:29:50,495 --> 00:29:53,117
And you! I'll gonna
miss you most of all!

532
00:29:53,217 --> 00:29:55,330
All flame-haired and fiery!

533
00:29:56,052 --> 00:29:58,205
Oh, but why d'you have to go?

534
00:29:58,361 --> 00:30:01,497
It's the new law!
England for the English, et cetera.

535
00:30:01,747 --> 00:30:03,893
They can't send us home,
the oceans are closed,

536
00:30:03,993 --> 00:30:05,151
they build labour camps!

537
00:30:05,251 --> 00:30:08,360
I know, but labour doing what?
There aren't any jobs.

538
00:30:09,125 --> 00:30:12,050
Sewing, digging, is good!

539
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:15,895
Now, stop it
before I kiss you too much...

540
00:30:17,915 --> 00:30:18,806
Wilfred!

541
00:30:19,825 --> 00:30:20,870
My capitano!

542
00:30:36,648 --> 00:30:38,262
<i>It'll be quiet with him gone.</i>

543
00:30:38,782 --> 00:30:40,650
<i>Still, we'll have more room.</i>

544
00:30:41,055 --> 00:30:42,041
Labour camps.

545
00:30:43,023 --> 00:30:44,869
That's what they called them last time.

546
00:30:45,432 --> 00:30:46,410
What d'you mean?

547
00:30:51,542 --> 00:30:52,650
It's happening again.

548
00:30:53,469 --> 00:30:54,257
What is?

549
00:31:00,502 --> 00:31:01,228
'Scuse me!

550
00:31:01,697 --> 00:31:03,261
'Scuse me, where
are you taking them?

551
00:31:03,912 --> 00:31:05,138
Where are you going?

552
00:31:05,420 --> 00:31:07,203
Where are you going?

553
00:31:07,578 --> 00:31:09,224
Where are you going?!

554
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:12,460
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?!

555
00:31:30,736 --> 00:31:32,019
I asked about jobs.

556
00:31:32,745 --> 00:31:33,715
With the army.

557
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:36,140
They said I wasn't qualified.

558
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:44,005
You were right. You said I should
have worked harder at school.

559
00:31:50,140 --> 00:31:51,967
Suppose I've always
been a disappointment.

560
00:31:52,893 --> 00:31:53,606
Yeah.

561
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:11,593
You know we'd get a bit of cash
if we sold this thing.

562
00:32:11,912 --> 00:32:13,013
Don't you dare.

563
00:32:14,552 --> 00:32:19,604
I always imagined, your old age...
I'd have put a bit of money by.

564
00:32:20,049 --> 00:32:21,223
Make you comfy.

565
00:32:22,462 --> 00:32:23,375
Never did.

566
00:32:24,364 --> 00:32:25,497
I'm just useless.

567
00:32:29,482 --> 00:32:31,570
You're supposed to say,
"No, you're not."

568
00:32:32,779 --> 00:32:34,450
Ah, it must be the alignment...

569
00:32:34,550 --> 00:32:35,125
What's wrong?

570
00:32:35,225 --> 00:32:38,598
Well, I dunno, I mean it can't be
the lens cos I was looking at Orion,

571
00:32:38,698 --> 00:32:40,613
the constellation of Orion.

572
00:32:40,713 --> 00:32:43,747
You take a look.
Now, tell me, what can you see?

573
00:32:43,847 --> 00:32:46,300
- Where?
- Well, up there, in the sky!

574
00:32:48,580 --> 00:32:50,880
Well, I can't see anything.
It's just black.

575
00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:53,713
Well, I mean it's working.
The telescope is working.

576
00:32:53,813 --> 00:32:54,495
Well...

577
00:32:55,033 --> 00:32:57,154
- maybe it's the clouds.
- There's no clouds.

578
00:32:57,254 --> 00:32:59,125
- Well, there must be!
- There's not!

579
00:32:59,225 --> 00:33:03,508
It was there, an entire constellation.

580
00:33:06,029 --> 00:33:06,730
<i>Look!</i>

581
00:33:08,158 --> 00:33:08,858
Look there.

582
00:33:11,158 --> 00:33:12,084
<i>They're going out.</i>

583
00:33:13,185 --> 00:33:14,242
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

584
00:33:14,999 --> 00:33:17,810
Donna, the stars are going out.

585
00:33:26,321 --> 00:33:27,610
I'm ready.

586
00:33:45,599 --> 00:33:48,446
<i>Loadstone testing now at 15.4,</i>

587
00:33:48,546 --> 00:33:50,398
<i>repeat 15.4.</i>

588
00:33:53,334 --> 00:33:55,573
- Ma'am.
- I've told you, don't salute.

589
00:33:55,673 --> 00:33:57,813
Well, if you're not going
to tell us your name...

590
00:33:58,063 --> 00:33:59,242
What, you don't know either?

591
00:33:59,342 --> 00:34:02,083
I've crossed too many different
realities. Trust me, the wrong word

592
00:34:02,183 --> 00:34:05,730
in the wrong place can change
an entire causal nexus.

593
00:34:05,830 --> 00:34:07,940
She talks like that. A lot.

594
00:34:08,753 --> 00:34:10,987
And you must be... Miss Noble.

595
00:34:11,475 --> 00:34:12,238
Donna.

596
00:34:12,676 --> 00:34:15,060
Captain Erisa Magambo.
Thank you for this.

597
00:34:15,348 --> 00:34:17,431
- I don't even know what I'm doing.
- Is it awake?

598
00:34:17,531 --> 00:34:20,075
Seems to be quiet, today.
Ticking over.

599
00:34:20,547 --> 00:34:21,761
<i>Like it's waiting.</i>

600
00:34:22,749 --> 00:34:23,980
D'you want to see it?

601
00:34:25,959 --> 00:34:27,386
What's a "police box"?

602
00:34:27,486 --> 00:34:30,026
They salvaged it from underneath
the Thames. Just go inside.

603
00:34:30,126 --> 00:34:32,084
- What for?
- Just go in.

604
00:34:50,448 --> 00:34:52,194
<i>No way!</i>

605
00:35:23,997 --> 00:35:25,023
What d'you think?

606
00:35:28,189 --> 00:35:29,196
Can I have a coffee?

607
00:35:29,296 --> 00:35:31,409
Time And Relative Dimension in Space.

608
00:35:32,797 --> 00:35:34,280
This room used to shine with light.

609
00:35:34,987 --> 00:35:36,100
I think it's dying.

610
00:35:41,952 --> 00:35:43,370
It's still trying to help.

611
00:35:44,355 --> 00:35:46,738
And... it belonged to the Doctor?

612
00:35:46,838 --> 00:35:49,598
He was a Time Lord. Last of his kind.

613
00:35:49,873 --> 00:35:51,622
But if he was so special,

614
00:35:52,817 --> 00:35:53,980
what was he doing with me?

615
00:35:54,281 --> 00:35:55,520
He thought you were brilliant.

616
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:57,503
- Don't be stupid.
- But you are.

617
00:35:57,603 --> 00:36:00,543
It just took the Doctor to show you
that, simply by being with him.

618
00:36:01,063 --> 00:36:04,047
He did the same to me,
to everyone he touches.

619
00:36:06,694 --> 00:36:08,083
Were you and him...?

620
00:36:18,321 --> 00:36:19,970
- D'you want to see it?
- No.

621
00:36:24,449 --> 00:36:25,172
Go on, then.

622
00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:27,103
We don't know how the TARDIS works,

623
00:36:27,203 --> 00:36:29,527
but we've managed to scrape off
the surface technology,

624
00:36:29,627 --> 00:36:31,250
enough to show you the creature.

625
00:36:32,505 --> 00:36:33,439
It's a creature?

626
00:36:33,764 --> 00:36:34,778
Just stand here.

627
00:36:35,041 --> 00:36:36,380
Out of the circle, please.

628
00:36:38,056 --> 00:36:39,120
Yes, ma'am.

629
00:36:40,328 --> 00:36:41,635
Can't you stay with me?

630
00:36:43,012 --> 00:36:43,985
Ready?

631
00:36:44,599 --> 00:36:46,845
And... activate.

632
00:36:53,671 --> 00:36:56,155
- Open your eyes, Donna.
- Is it there?

633
00:36:56,255 --> 00:36:57,920
Open your eyes. Look at it.

634
00:36:59,215 --> 00:37:01,574
- I can't.
- It's part of you, Donna. Look.

635
00:37:11,388 --> 00:37:15,690
It's OK, it's OK, it's OK, calm down!
Donna, Donna, Donna! OK.

636
00:37:27,329 --> 00:37:28,024
What is it?

637
00:37:28,593 --> 00:37:29,688
We don't know.

638
00:37:30,051 --> 00:37:32,466
Oh... thanks!

639
00:37:32,870 --> 00:37:34,178
It feeds off time.

640
00:37:34,772 --> 00:37:37,694
By changing time, by making
someone's life take a different turn,

641
00:37:37,794 --> 00:37:40,917
like, er, meetings never made,

642
00:37:41,919 --> 00:37:43,426
<i>children never born, </i>

643
00:37:43,795 --> 00:37:45,037
a life never loved.

644
00:37:46,451 --> 00:37:49,504
- But with you it's...
- I never did anything important.

645
00:37:49,604 --> 00:37:53,108
Yes, you did. One day, that thing
made you turn right, instead of left.

646
00:37:53,208 --> 00:37:55,155
- When was that?
- You wouldn't remember.

647
00:37:55,255 --> 00:37:57,990
It was the most ordinary day
in the world. But by turning right,

648
00:37:58,259 --> 00:38:02,207
you never met the Doctor. And the whole
world just changed around you.

649
00:38:02,735 --> 00:38:04,330
Can you get rid of it?

650
00:38:04,590 --> 00:38:06,417
No, I can't even touch it.

651
00:38:07,449 --> 00:38:09,161
Seems to be in a state of flux.

652
00:38:09,887 --> 00:38:12,321
What does that mean?

653
00:38:12,659 --> 00:38:13,572
I don't know.

654
00:38:14,173 --> 00:38:16,013
Sort of thing the Doctor would say.

655
00:38:16,113 --> 00:38:17,132
You liar!

656
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:20,874
You told me I was special.

657
00:38:21,581 --> 00:38:25,485
But it's not me,
it's this thing, I'm just a host!

658
00:38:25,654 --> 00:38:27,662
No, there's more than that...

659
00:38:28,175 --> 00:38:29,559
The readings are strange.

660
00:38:30,097 --> 00:38:32,412
It's like reality is just
bending around you.

661
00:38:32,512 --> 00:38:34,402
Because of this thing!

662
00:38:34,502 --> 00:38:36,829
No, no, we're getting
separate readings from you.

663
00:38:37,053 --> 00:38:39,555
And they've always been there,
since the day you were born.

664
00:38:39,655 --> 00:38:41,845
This is not relevant to the mission.

665
00:38:42,383 --> 00:38:44,335
I thought it was just
the Doctor we needed,

666
00:38:45,168 --> 00:38:48,704
but it's the both of you.
The Doctor and Donna Noble. Together.

667
00:38:49,405 --> 00:38:51,132
To stop the stars from going out.

668
00:38:52,015 --> 00:38:52,877
Why?

669
00:38:54,438 --> 00:38:56,570
What can I do?

670
00:39:02,703 --> 00:39:03,900
Turn it off!

671
00:39:05,620 --> 00:39:06,046
Please.

672
00:39:06,290 --> 00:39:07,885
- Captain.
- Power down.

673
00:39:16,734 --> 00:39:18,968
It's still there, though.

674
00:39:21,264 --> 00:39:22,203
What can I do...

675
00:39:23,276 --> 00:39:24,496
to get rid of it?

676
00:39:25,691 --> 00:39:27,170
You're going to travel in time!

677
00:39:27,430 --> 00:39:30,471
The TARDIS has tracked down the moment
of intervention, Monday the 25th,

678
00:39:30,571 --> 00:39:31,835
10:01 in the morning.

679
00:39:31,935 --> 00:39:35,130
Your car was on Little Sutton, leading
to Ealing Road, but you turned right,

680
00:39:35,230 --> 00:39:36,435
heading for Griffin's Parade.

681
00:39:36,535 --> 00:39:39,138
You need to turn left.
You've got to go back,

682
00:39:39,238 --> 00:39:40,450
turn left. Got that, Donna?

683
00:39:40,550 --> 00:39:44,115
At 10:01, make yourself turn left,
heading for the Chiswick High Road.

684
00:39:44,215 --> 00:39:47,398
Keep the jacket on at all times it's
insulation against temporal feedback.

685
00:39:47,498 --> 00:39:49,888
This will correspond to
local time wherever you land.

686
00:39:49,988 --> 00:39:52,130
This is to combat dehydration.

687
00:40:01,620 --> 00:40:03,097
This is where we leave you.

688
00:40:03,197 --> 00:40:04,836
Don't want to see that thing on my back.

689
00:40:04,936 --> 00:40:06,913
No, the mirrors are just incidental.

690
00:40:07,013 --> 00:40:09,055
<i>They bounce chronon
energy back into the centre,</i>

691
00:40:09,155 --> 00:40:12,008
which we control
and decide the destination.

692
00:40:12,371 --> 00:40:13,828
It's a time machine.

693
00:40:14,379 --> 00:40:15,837
It's a time machine.

694
00:40:16,156 --> 00:40:17,132
If you could...

695
00:40:23,732 --> 00:40:24,808
Powering up!

696
00:40:30,352 --> 00:40:32,636
- How d'you know it's gonna work?
- Hmm?

697
00:40:33,030 --> 00:40:37,730
Oh, we... we don't.
We're... we're just guessing.

698
00:40:40,173 --> 00:40:41,387
Brilliant!

699
00:40:41,487 --> 00:40:43,339
<i>Just remember,
when you get to the junction,</i>

700
00:40:43,439 --> 00:40:46,067
change the car's direction
by one minute past ten.

701
00:40:46,190 --> 00:40:48,250
- How do I do that?
- It's up to you.

702
00:40:48,645 --> 00:40:51,481
Well... I'll just have to...

703
00:40:51,925 --> 00:40:55,128
run up to myself and...
have a good argument.

704
00:40:55,503 --> 00:40:58,313
- I'd like to see that.
- Activate lodestone.

705
00:41:01,326 --> 00:41:02,221
Good luck.

706
00:41:02,991 --> 00:41:05,050
- I'm ready!
- One minute past ten.

707
00:41:05,537 --> 00:41:07,139
Cos I understand now!

708
00:41:07,852 --> 00:41:09,504
You said I was gonna die, but...

709
00:41:09,804 --> 00:41:14,290
you mean this whole world,
it's gonna blink out of existence...

710
00:41:14,775 --> 00:41:18,588
but that's not dying,
cos a better world takes its place.

711
00:41:19,176 --> 00:41:20,219
The Doctor's world!

712
00:41:21,114 --> 00:41:22,371
<i>And I'm still alive!</i>

713
00:41:24,511 --> 00:41:27,495
That's right, isn't it?
I don't die. If I change things,

714
00:41:27,595 --> 00:41:31,144
I don't die. That's...
that's right, isn't it?

715
00:41:35,436 --> 00:41:36,290
I'm sorry.

716
00:41:37,050 --> 00:41:38,410
But I can't die!

717
00:41:40,022 --> 00:41:41,370
<i>I've got a future!</i>

718
00:41:42,406 --> 00:41:44,770
With the Doctor, you told me!

719
00:41:45,910 --> 00:41:46,923
Activate!

720
00:42:21,791 --> 00:42:22,440
But...

721
00:42:23,235 --> 00:42:25,256
Hold on... But this is...

722
00:42:26,119 --> 00:42:27,020
I'm not...

723
00:42:28,672 --> 00:42:30,061
This is Sutton Court!

724
00:42:31,553 --> 00:42:35,075
I'm half a mile away!
I'M HALF A MILE AWAY!

725
00:42:38,430 --> 00:42:39,636
Four minutes.

726
00:42:41,094 --> 00:42:42,095
Oh, my God!

727
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:48,039
Jival Chowdry,

728
00:42:49,209 --> 00:42:52,132
he runs that little photocopy
business in Merchant Street

729
00:42:52,232 --> 00:42:53,897
and he needs a secretary.

730
00:42:54,066 --> 00:42:55,680
I've got a job!

731
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:08,471
HC Clements is in the city.
It's nice, it's posh,

732
00:43:08,655 --> 00:43:10,027
so stop it!

733
00:43:20,241 --> 00:43:22,700
It won't take long,
just turn right.

734
00:43:25,127 --> 00:43:27,570
I'm going left, if you don't like it,
get out and walk!

735
00:43:29,935 --> 00:43:31,334
You think I'm so useless.

736
00:43:31,434 --> 00:43:34,646
Oh, I know why you want
a job with HC Clements, lady.

737
00:43:34,746 --> 00:43:36,510
Cos you think you'll meet a man.

738
00:43:43,870 --> 00:43:45,300
I'm not gonna get there.

739
00:43:50,768 --> 00:43:51,900
You're gonna die.

740
00:43:59,060 --> 00:44:02,925
City executives don't need
temps, except for practice.

741
00:44:04,367 --> 00:44:04,980
Yeah.

742
00:44:05,893 --> 00:44:07,250
Suppose you're right.

743
00:44:12,347 --> 00:44:13,130
Please.

744
00:44:20,516 --> 00:44:22,170
Can you hear that?

745
00:44:22,906 --> 00:44:25,665
- Oh, no! Go back!
- Oi! Get a move on!

746
00:44:27,586 --> 00:44:30,668
- The traffic's stopping.
- Something must've happened.

747
00:44:40,587 --> 00:44:41,632
Tell him this.

748
00:44:42,758 --> 00:44:43,891
Two words.

749
00:44:54,879 --> 00:44:57,515
Well, that decides it.
I'm not sitting in a traffic jam.

750
00:44:57,734 --> 00:44:59,264
<i>I'm going left! I'm going left!</i>

751
00:44:59,364 --> 00:45:00,590
<i>Left... left... left...</i>

752
00:45:05,150 --> 00:45:06,130
<i>Left...</i>

753
00:45:06,302 --> 00:45:07,970
<i>Left... left...</i>

754
00:45:20,894 --> 00:45:22,890
What the hell is that?!

755
00:45:22,990 --> 00:45:24,748
You were so strong.

756
00:45:25,980 --> 00:45:27,526
What are you?

757
00:45:28,195 --> 00:45:29,975
What will you be?

758
00:45:31,501 --> 00:45:32,953
<i>What will you be?</i>

759
00:45:36,162 --> 00:45:37,188
Everything all right?

760
00:45:38,127 --> 00:45:39,224
Oh, God...!

761
00:45:41,695 --> 00:45:43,065
What was that for?!

762
00:45:44,003 --> 00:45:45,098
I don't know!

763
00:45:52,814 --> 00:45:54,103
<i>Can't remember.</i>

764
00:45:55,360 --> 00:45:56,600
It's slipping away.

765
00:45:58,132 --> 00:46:01,210
You know, like when you think
of a dream, and it sort of goes.

766
00:46:01,867 --> 00:46:03,062
Just got lucky, this thing.

767
00:46:03,312 --> 00:46:04,883
It's one of the Trickster's Brigade.

768
00:46:05,959 --> 00:46:07,917
Changes a life in tiny little ways.

769
00:46:08,380 --> 00:46:11,175
Most times, the universe just
compensates around it, but with you...

770
00:46:11,763 --> 00:46:13,896
great big parallel world!

771
00:46:15,016 --> 00:46:17,838
Hold on, you said
parallel worlds are sealed off.

772
00:46:18,095 --> 00:46:18,860
They are.

773
00:46:19,123 --> 00:46:20,810
But you had one created around you.

774
00:46:21,863 --> 00:46:24,970
Funny thing is...
seems to be happening a lot. To you.

775
00:46:25,911 --> 00:46:26,781
How d'you mean?

776
00:46:26,881 --> 00:46:28,841
Well, the Library. Then this.

777
00:46:29,642 --> 00:46:33,020
Just goes with the job, I suppose.

778
00:46:33,333 --> 00:46:36,361
Sometimes I think there's way
too much coincidence around you, Donna.

779
00:46:36,668 --> 00:46:39,715
I met you once. Then I met
your grandfather. Then I met you again.

780
00:46:39,925 --> 00:46:42,928
In the whole wide universe,
I met you for a second time.

781
00:46:44,323 --> 00:46:46,325
It's like something's
binding us together.

782
00:46:47,595 --> 00:46:50,073
Don't be so daft.
I'm nothing special.

783
00:46:50,173 --> 00:46:51,918
Yes, you are, you're brilliant.

784
00:46:53,383 --> 00:46:54,615
He thought you were brilliant.

785
00:46:56,849 --> 00:46:57,868
SHE said that.

786
00:46:59,040 --> 00:46:59,772
Who did?

787
00:47:00,091 --> 00:47:00,873
That woman.

788
00:47:01,886 --> 00:47:03,163
I can't remember...

789
00:47:03,263 --> 00:47:04,758
She never existed, now.

790
00:47:05,202 --> 00:47:06,291
No, but she said...

791
00:47:06,817 --> 00:47:07,770
<i>The stars...</i>

792
00:47:10,479 --> 00:47:12,093
She said the stars are going out.

793
00:47:12,193 --> 00:47:15,370
- Yeah, but that world's gone.
- No, but she said it was all worlds.

794
00:47:15,697 --> 00:47:16,798
Every world.

795
00:47:17,780 --> 00:47:19,915
She said the darkness is coming.

796
00:47:20,384 --> 00:47:22,050
- Even here.
- Who was she?

797
00:47:22,393 --> 00:47:24,733
- I don't know.
- What did she look like?

798
00:47:25,709 --> 00:47:26,503
She was...

799
00:47:28,064 --> 00:47:28,880
blonde.

800
00:47:29,079 --> 00:47:29,936
What was her name?

801
00:47:30,036 --> 00:47:31,940
- I don't know.
- Donna, what was her name?

802
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:35,570
But she told me...

803
00:47:36,074 --> 00:47:37,037
<i>to warn you.</i>

804
00:47:37,694 --> 00:47:39,480
She said... two words.

805
00:47:39,631 --> 00:47:41,740
What two words? What were they?
What did she say?

806
00:47:47,758 --> 00:47:48,841
"Bad Wolf."

807
00:47:51,295 --> 00:47:52,420
What does it mean?

808
00:48:14,932 --> 00:48:16,190
Doctor, what is it?

809
00:48:16,809 --> 00:48:18,167
What's Bad Wolf?

810
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:21,309
It's the end of the universe.

811
00:48:34,921 --> 00:48:37,317
Ladies and gentlemen, we are at war.

812
00:48:37,510 --> 00:48:39,770
- It can't be.
- There's nothing I can do.

813
00:48:39,925 --> 00:48:42,915
- Oh, my God!
- What is it, who are they?

814
00:48:43,166 --> 00:48:44,448
What are we going to do?

815
00:48:45,268 --> 00:48:46,370
It's impossible.

816
00:48:46,791 --> 00:48:48,074
It can't be!

817
00:48:48,443 --> 00:48:49,988
I'm sorry, we're dead.

818
00:48:50,088 --> 00:48:51,352
Doctor, come back!

819
00:48:53,029 --> 00:48:54,587
It's only just beginning.

820
