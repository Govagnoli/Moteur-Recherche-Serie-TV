1
00:00:01,009 --> 00:00:02,334
Salutations!

2
00:00:02,523 --> 00:00:05,571
This is Sally Calypso
    with the traffic news at 10.15

3
00:00:06,034 --> 00:00:09,681
We've got reports of a multiple
stack pile at Junction 509,

4
00:00:10,435 --> 00:00:13,421
with a spate of car jackings
reported on New Fifth Avenue,

5
00:00:13,747 --> 00:00:15,280
 so you take care now!

6
00:00:15,470 --> 00:00:16,889
Drive safely.

7
00:00:20,866 --> 00:00:22,275
They're gonna get in,

8
00:00:22,327 --> 00:00:23,347
 there's no stopping them.

9
00:00:25,934 --> 00:00:28,541
The police are on their way,
I promise, I've sounded the alarm.

10
00:00:29,089 --> 00:00:32,148
Repeat, this is Car One Zero
Hot Five,

11
00:00:32,149 --> 00:00:34,333
we have a problem,
require urgent assistance.

12
00:00:34,501 --> 00:00:37,129
'Thank you for your call,
you are on hold.'

13
00:00:37,186 --> 00:00:42,887
It's all your fault, you lied to the computer, 
you said there were three of us, you told them three!

14
00:00:42,964 --> 00:00:44,919
Repeat, urgent assistance, 

15
00:00:44,957 --> 00:00:47,628
Car One
Zero Hot Five, this is an emergency.

16
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:51,191
Help us! Oh, my God,
I'm begging you, please, help us.

17
00:00:54,509 --> 00:00:59,402
'The weather is at 36 degrees and 
it's blue skies all the way home.'

18
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:01,537
This is Sally Calypso signing off.

19
00:01:01,861 --> 00:01:03,307
Missing you already!

20
00:01:38,493 --> 00:01:39,460
 Just one trip,

21
00:01:39,575 --> 00:01:40,594
that's what I said, one trip

22
00:01:40,692 --> 00:01:41,908
in the TARDIS and then home.

23
00:01:42,532 --> 00:01:43,530
Although. . .

24
00:01:43,952 --> 00:01:45,831
I suppose we could...

25
00:01:46,137 --> 00:01:47,249
stretch the definition

26
00:01:47,616 --> 00:01:49,439
One trip into the past, one into
   the future,

27
00:01:49,948 --> 00:01:50,753
how do you fancy that?

28
00:01:50,852 --> 00:01:52,604
No complaints from me.

29
00:01:52,692 --> 00:01:53,595
How about...

30
00:01:54,617 --> 00:01:55,520
a different planet?

31
00:01:56,128 --> 00:01:57,212
Can we go to yours?

32
00:01:59,692 --> 00:02:01,433
Aah, there's plenty of other places.

33
00:02:01,499 --> 00:02:05,224
Come on! I mean, planet of the Time Lords,
that's gotta be worth a look.

34
00:02:05,658 --> 00:02:06,857
What's it like?

35
00:02:07,149 --> 00:02:08,085
Well, it's beautiful, yeah.

36
00:02:08,890 --> 00:02:10,286
Is it like, you know,

37
00:02:10,566 --> 00:02:13,337
outer space cities, all spires and stuff?

38
00:02:13,617 --> 00:02:14,438
Suppose it is.

39
00:02:14,536 --> 00:02:17,457
Great big temples and cathedrals?

40
00:02:17,818 --> 00:02:18,410
Yeah.

41
00:02:18,755 --> 00:02:20,375
With lots of planets in the sky?

42
00:02:22,985 --> 00:02:24,578
The sky's a burnt orange

43
00:02:26,697 --> 00:02:29,621
with the Citadel enclosed in a mighty glass dome,

44
00:02:30,895 --> 00:02:32,619
shining under the twin suns.

45
00:02:33,769 --> 00:02:35,560
Beyond that, the mountains go on
   for ever,

46
00:02:36,003 --> 00:02:37,005
slopes of. . .

47
00:02:37,416 --> 00:02:38,806
deep red grass,

48
00:02:40,021 --> 00:02:41,154
capped with snow.

49
00:02:45,819 --> 00:02:46,739
Can we go there?

50
00:02:49,425 --> 00:02:51,051
Naah, where's the fun for me?

51
00:02:51,101 --> 00:02:51,791
I don't want to go home!

52
00:02:51,988 --> 00:02:52,749
Instead...

53
00:02:55,630 --> 00:02:56,730
This is much better!

54
00:02:56,798 --> 00:02:59,758
The year 5 billion and 53, planet New Earth!

55
00:02:59,808 --> 00:03:01,236
Second home of mankind.

56
00:03:01,351 --> 00:03:02,928
50,000 light years from your old world,

57
00:03:03,142 --> 00:03:05,047
and we're slap bang in the middle of New New York.

58
00:03:05,326 --> 00:03:10,892
Technically, it's the 15th New York so it's New 
New New New New New New New New New 
New New New New New York,

59
00:03:10,975 --> 00:03:12,404
one of the most dazzling cities ever built.

60
00:03:13,471 --> 00:03:14,538
Oh, that's nice(!)

61
00:03:15,212 --> 00:03:17,150
Time Lord version of dazzling.

62
00:03:17,298 --> 00:03:20,658
Naah, bit of rain never hurt anyone. Come on!
Let's get undercover.

63
00:03:25,536 --> 00:03:26,847
He has arrived.

64
00:03:27,422 --> 00:03:28,342
What should I do?

65
00:03:28,867 --> 00:03:30,148
Find him.

66
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:32,079
Before it's too late.

67
00:03:40,362 --> 00:03:42,514
It looks like the same old Earth to me.

68
00:03:42,645 --> 00:03:44,107
On a Wednesday afternoon.

69
00:03:51,325 --> 00:03:53,444
And the driving should be clear and easy,

70
00:03:53,510 --> 00:03:57,205
with 15 extra lanes open for the New New Jersey Expressway.

71
00:03:57,831 --> 00:04:01,263
That's more like it, that's the view we had last time. 
This must be the lower levels,

72
00:04:02,101 --> 00:04:03,974
down at the base of the tower, some sort of Undercity.

73
00:04:04,483 --> 00:04:06,142
You've brought me to the slums.

74
00:04:06,454 --> 00:04:09,140
More interesting!
It's all cocktails and glitter up there.

75
00:04:09,288 --> 00:04:10,306
This is the real city.

76
00:04:10,602 --> 00:04:11,751
You'd enjoy anything.

77
00:04:11,899 --> 00:04:12,343
That's me!

78
00:04:12,490 --> 00:04:13,509
Ah, the rain's stopping.

79
00:04:14,041 --> 00:04:15,029
Better and better!

80
00:04:15,604 --> 00:04:16,885
When you say "last time",

81
00:04:17,296 --> 00:04:18,777
was that you and Rose?

82
00:04:19,398 --> 00:04:21,238
Um, yeah, yeah, it was, yeah.

83
00:04:22,289 --> 00:04:24,372
You're taking me to the same planets that you took her?

84
00:04:24,618 --> 00:04:25,456
What's wrong with that?

85
00:04:26,474 --> 00:04:27,214
Nothing.

86
00:04:27,781 --> 00:04:29,276
Just, ever heard the word "rebound"?

87
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:33,629
Oh, you should've said. 
How long have you been there?

88
00:04:33,661 --> 00:04:36,237
Happy, you want happy?
Happy, happy.

89
00:04:36,238 --> 00:04:37,629
Customers, customers.

90
00:04:37,695 --> 00:04:39,370
We've got customers.

91
00:04:39,371 --> 00:04:40,389
We're in business!

92
00:04:40,438 --> 00:04:42,294
Mother, open up the mellow!

93
00:04:42,343 --> 00:04:44,101
Happy happy, lovely happy happy.

94
00:04:44,166 --> 00:04:46,101
Anger! Buy some anger.

95
00:04:46,134 --> 00:04:48,877
Mellow, makes you feel bendy and soft all day long!

96
00:04:48,927 --> 00:04:51,580
They'll rip you off. Do you want some happy?

97
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:52,434
No, thanks.

98
00:04:53,108 --> 00:04:54,389
Are they selling drugs?

99
00:04:55,095 --> 00:04:57,345
I think they're selling moods.

100
00:04:57,444 --> 00:04:58,577
Same thing, isn't it?

101
00:05:00,121 --> 00:05:01,270
 Oi,

102
00:05:01,336 --> 00:05:03,225
you, over here! Over here.

103
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:04,720
Buy some happy, happy. happy.

104
00:05:05,048 --> 00:05:06,395
What can I get you?

105
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:07,680
I want to buy forget.

106
00:05:07,828 --> 00:05:10,209
I've got forget, what strength?

107
00:05:10,308 --> 00:05:11,688
How much do you want forgetting?

108
00:05:11,901 --> 00:05:14,272
My mother and father.
They went on the Motorway.

109
00:05:14,447 --> 00:05:16,135
Oh, that's a swine.

110
00:05:17,465 --> 00:05:18,287
Try this,

111
00:05:18,566 --> 00:05:19,633
Forget 43,

112
00:05:19,814 --> 00:05:20,810
that's two credits.

113
00:05:20,925 --> 00:05:22,124
Sorry, but,

114
00:05:22,206 --> 00:05:24,062
hold on a minute, what happened to your parents?

115
00:05:24,308 --> 00:05:25,261
They drove off.

116
00:05:25,754 --> 00:05:26,345
Yeah, but

117
00:05:27,265 --> 00:05:28,218
they might drive back.

118
00:05:28,605 --> 00:05:30,329
Everyone goes to the Motorway in the end.

119
00:05:31,315 --> 00:05:32,235
I've lost them.

120
00:05:33,042 --> 00:05:35,342
But they can't have gone far, you could find them.

121
00:05:37,619 --> 00:05:38,653
No, no, don't!

122
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:43,729
Sorry, what were you saying?

123
00:05:44,172 --> 00:05:44,928
Your parents,

124
00:05:45,618 --> 00:05:47,430
your mother and father, they're on the Motorway.

125
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:48,760
Are they?

126
00:05:50,107 --> 00:05:50,961
That's nice.

127
00:05:52,670 --> 00:05:54,246
I'm sorry, I won't keep you.

128
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:01,500
So that's the human race five billion years in the future.

129
00:06:02,009 --> 00:06:03,398
Off their heads on chemicals.

130
00:06:03,827 --> 00:06:06,703
I'm really, really sorry. We just need three, that's all.

131
00:06:06,733 --> 00:06:07,452
Let her go!

132
00:06:07,554 --> 00:06:08,743
I'm warning you,

133
00:06:08,805 --> 00:06:09,380
let her go!

134
00:06:09,421 --> 00:06:10,632
Whatever you want,

135
00:06:10,673 --> 00:06:14,388
I can help, both of us can help you, but first, you've got to let her go!

136
00:06:25,515 --> 00:06:28,614
The Doctor is so gonna kill you and never mind him, I'm gonna kill you myself.

137
00:06:28,696 --> 00:06:29,764
 Let go of me!

138
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,385
Give her some sleep.

139
00:06:31,467 --> 00:06:32,247
That's enough!

140
00:06:32,248 --> 00:06:34,356
Don't you dare!
It's just Sleep 14, 

141
00:06:34,526 --> 00:06:35,511
Don't you put that thing on me.

142
00:06:35,614 --> 00:06:37,809
Don't fight it. That's it, come on,

143
00:06:38,097 --> 00:06:39,881
that's it.
Get on board.

144
00:06:47,045 --> 00:06:48,113
Engaging antigravs.

145
00:06:48,893 --> 00:06:49,591
Hold on!

146
00:06:55,842 --> 00:06:58,080
MARTHA!

147
00:07:03,732 --> 00:07:04,574
 She's all right,

148
00:07:04,861 --> 00:07:06,277
she's breathing. Pulse is fine,

149
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,263
no harm done.

150
00:07:08,433 --> 00:07:09,356
She looks rich.

151
00:07:09,828 --> 00:07:11,162
She must've got lost.

152
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:13,461
She's worth her weight in gold to us.

153
00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:17,789
This is Car 465 Diamond 6, we have three passengers, repeat, three.

154
00:07:19,688 --> 00:07:21,043
'Access granted.'

155
00:07:21,228 --> 00:07:22,324
Oh, yes!

156
00:07:28,638 --> 00:07:29,623
Thought you'd come back.

157
00:07:29,972 --> 00:07:31,512
Do you want some happy happy?

158
00:07:31,594 --> 00:07:33,544
Who were those people?
Where did they take her?

159
00:07:33,810 --> 00:07:35,596
 They've taken her to the Motorway.

160
00:07:36,048 --> 00:07:37,690
Looked like carjackers.

161
00:07:37,936 --> 00:07:39,476
I'd give up now, darling,

162
00:07:39,784 --> 00:07:41,200
you won't see her again.

163
00:07:41,292 --> 00:07:42,750
Used to be thriving, this place.

164
00:07:42,914 --> 00:07:45,915
But they all go to the Motorway in the end.

165
00:07:45,992 --> 00:07:48,414
He kept on saying three, "We need three.
" What did he mean, three?

166
00:07:48,538 --> 00:07:51,021
It's the car-sharing policy, to save fuel.

167
00:07:51,144 --> 00:07:53,854
You get special access if you're carrying three adults.

168
00:07:53,977 --> 00:07:55,065
This motorway, how do I get there?

169
00:07:55,311 --> 00:07:58,041
Down the alley, keep going to the end, you can't miss it.

170
00:07:58,410 --> 00:07:59,457
Tell you what,

171
00:07:59,847 --> 00:08:00,996
buy some happy happy,

172
00:08:01,181 --> 00:08:02,618
then you'll be smiling, my love!

173
00:08:02,761 --> 00:08:04,157
Word of advice. All of you. . .

174
00:08:04,711 --> 00:08:05,368
cash up,

175
00:08:05,594 --> 00:08:07,523
close down and pack your bags.

176
00:08:07,646 --> 00:08:08,631
Why's that, then?

177
00:08:09,104 --> 00:08:11,177
 Because as soon as I've found her alive and well,

178
00:08:11,769 --> 00:08:14,111
and I will find her alive and well, then I'm coming back

179
00:08:14,789 --> 00:08:16,431
And this street is closing.

180
00:08:16,841 --> 00:08:17,744
Tonight!!

181
00:08:21,949 --> 00:08:27,393
# Car 465 Diamond 6 heading for the Fast Lane.
. . .Thank you very much.

182
00:08:27,469 --> 00:08:31,135
# - You just settle down. It's all gonna be worth it. 
# -Yeah.

183
00:08:33,329 --> 00:08:38,697
# The view from the windows.
# You can see all the way to the open sky.

184
00:08:39,004 --> 00:08:42,271
They say the air smells like apple grass, can you imagine?

185
00:08:42,353 --> 00:08:43,659
 And houses are made of wood,

186
00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:46,189
 there are jobs going in the foundries - everyone says so.

187
00:08:47,346 --> 00:08:48,064
Take me back.

188
00:08:48,516 --> 00:08:50,404
Whoever you are, just take me back to my friend,

189
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:51,820
that's all I want.

190
00:08:52,333 --> 00:08:54,017
I won't cause any trouble, just take me back.

191
00:08:54,222 --> 00:08:55,351
I'm sorry,

192
00:08:55,610 --> 00:08:56,837
that's not a real gun.

193
00:08:57,642 --> 00:08:58,676
Yeah, well, you would say that.

194
00:08:58,824 --> 00:09:00,774
Where do you get a gun from these days?

195
00:09:01,102 --> 00:09:02,457
I wouldn't even know how to fire.

196
00:09:03,504 --> 00:09:04,921
No, nor me.

197
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:06,521
OK.

198
00:09:07,137 --> 00:09:08,040
What's your name?

199
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:09,517
Martha.

200
00:09:10,318 --> 00:09:11,139
Martha Jones.

201
00:09:11,406 --> 00:09:13,581
Well, I'm Cheen, and this is Milo.

202
00:09:13,971 --> 00:09:15,490
And I swear, we're sorry,

203
00:09:15,552 --> 00:09:16,886
we're really, really sorry.

204
00:09:17,009 --> 00:09:18,723
We just needed access to the Fast Lane.

205
00:09:18,805 --> 00:09:21,884
As soon as we arrive, we'll drop you and you can go back to your friend.

206
00:09:21,966 --> 00:09:22,582
Seriously?

207
00:09:22,746 --> 00:09:23,957
I swear, look!

208
00:09:24,819 --> 00:09:25,578
Honesty patch.

209
00:09:26,687 --> 00:09:27,508
All the same,

210
00:09:28,042 --> 00:09:29,396
it's still kidnapping!

211
00:09:29,848 --> 00:09:30,710
Where are we, anyway?

212
00:09:30,966 --> 00:09:31,684
We're on the Motorway.

213
00:09:31,992 --> 00:09:33,121
What's that, then? Fog?

214
00:09:33,696 --> 00:09:34,804
It's exhaust fumes.

215
00:09:35,152 --> 00:09:35,973
We're going out to Brooklyn.

216
00:09:36,117 --> 00:09:37,903
Everyone says the air's so much cleaner,

217
00:09:38,026 --> 00:09:40,209
and we couldn't stay in Pharmacytown, cos. . .

218
00:09:40,272 --> 00:09:41,372
Well, cos of me.

219
00:09:41,803 --> 00:09:42,542
I'm pregnant.

220
00:09:42,768 --> 00:09:44,204
We only discovered it last week.

221
00:09:44,348 --> 00:09:45,928
Scan says it's going to be a boy.

222
00:09:46,113 --> 00:09:47,139
Right!

223
00:09:47,488 --> 00:09:49,541
What do I do now, congratulate my kidnappers?

224
00:09:49,643 --> 00:09:51,396
 Oh, we're not kidnappers,

225
00:09:51,983 --> 00:09:52,815
not really.

226
00:09:53,132 --> 00:09:53,604
No,

227
00:09:54,035 --> 00:09:54,877
you're idiots.

228
00:09:55,123 --> 00:09:56,560
You're having a baby and you're wearing that?

229
00:09:56,642 --> 00:09:57,299
 Ow!

230
00:09:58,387 --> 00:09:59,434
Not any more.

231
00:09:59,435 --> 00:10:01,157
We'll be as fast as we can.

232
00:10:01,609 --> 00:10:03,292
We'll take the Motorway to the Brooklyn Flyover. . .

233
00:10:03,661 --> 00:10:07,808
and then, after that, it's gonna take a while, cos there's no Fast Lane, 
just ordinary roads, but it's direct.

234
00:10:07,931 --> 00:10:09,019
It's only ten miles.

235
00:10:09,101 --> 00:10:10,209
How long's it gonna take?

236
00:10:10,537 --> 00:10:11,728
About six years.

237
00:10:14,478 --> 00:10:15,361
What?

238
00:10:15,977 --> 00:10:17,927
We'll be just in time for him to start school.

239
00:10:19,424 --> 00:10:21,021
No, sorry, hold on.

240
00:10:21,231 --> 00:10:22,154
Six years?

241
00:10:22,339 --> 00:10:23,714
Ten miles in six years?

242
00:10:23,879 --> 00:10:24,700
How come?

243
00:10:52,984 --> 00:10:53,728
 Hey,

244
00:10:53,843 --> 00:10:55,365
  you daft little streetstrut,

245
00:10:55,508 --> 00:10:57,109
what are you doing, standing there?

246
00:10:57,212 --> 00:10:59,080
Either get out or get in! Come on!

247
00:11:04,487 --> 00:11:05,832
Did you ever see the like?

248
00:11:06,293 --> 00:11:06,909
Here you go.

249
00:11:06,950 --> 00:11:09,043
He's just standing there, breathing it in.

250
00:11:11,055 --> 00:11:13,128
says back in the old days, on Junction 47,

251
00:11:13,773 --> 00:11:17,027
this woman stood in the exhaust fumes for a solid 20 minutes.

252
00:11:17,561 --> 00:11:20,579
By the time they found her, her head had swollen to 50 feet.

253
00:11:20,702 --> 00:11:21,872
Oh, you're making it up.

254
00:11:21,974 --> 00:11:23,922
A 50-foot head, just think of it!

255
00:11:24,816 --> 00:11:25,925
Imagine picking that nose.

256
00:11:26,089 --> 00:11:27,916
Stop it, that's disgusting!

257
00:11:28,101 --> 00:11:29,649
What? Did you never pick your nose?

258
00:11:29,793 --> 00:11:30,676
Bran, we're moving.

259
00:11:30,758 --> 00:11:32,133
Right, I'm there. I'm on it.

260
00:11:41,356 --> 00:11:43,409
20 yards - we're having a good day.

261
00:11:44,273 --> 00:11:45,217
And who might you be, sir?

262
00:11:45,607 --> 00:11:47,024
Very well dressed for a hitchhiker.

263
00:11:47,085 --> 00:11:49,097
Thanks. Sorry. I'm the Doctor.

264
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:52,566
Medical man!
My name's Thomas Kincaid Brannigan,

265
00:11:52,853 --> 00:11:54,947
and this is the bane of my life, the lovely Valerie.

266
00:11:55,234 --> 00:11:56,014
Nice to meet you.

267
00:11:56,322 --> 00:11:57,820
And that's the rest of the family, behind you.

268
00:12:02,142 --> 00:12:03,599
Ah, that's nice.

269
00:12:05,577 --> 00:12:06,542
Hello!

270
00:12:09,703 --> 00:12:10,524
How old are they?

271
00:12:10,811 --> 00:12:11,920
Just two months.

272
00:12:12,166 --> 00:12:13,110
Poor little souls,

273
00:12:13,254 --> 00:12:15,183
they've never known the ground beneath their paws.

274
00:12:16,046 --> 00:12:17,133
Children of the Motorway.

275
00:12:17,985 --> 00:12:18,929
What, they were born in here?

276
00:12:19,791 --> 00:12:20,530
We couldn't stop.

277
00:12:20,797 --> 00:12:23,927
We heard there were jobs out in the laundries, on Fire Island,

278
00:12:24,122 --> 00:12:25,169
thought we'd take a chance.

279
00:12:25,517 --> 00:12:27,057
You've been driving for two months?

280
00:12:27,734 --> 00:12:28,925
Do I look like a teenager?

281
00:12:29,109 --> 00:12:31,018
We've been driving for 12 years now.

282
00:12:31,336 --> 00:12:32,065
I'm sorry?

283
00:12:32,291 --> 00:12:32,908
Yeah,

284
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:34,200
started out as newlyweds.

285
00:12:34,621 --> 00:12:35,606
Feels like yesterday.

286
00:12:35,729 --> 00:12:37,187
Feels like 12 years to me.

287
00:12:37,248 --> 00:12:39,079
 Ah, sweetheart, but you still love me.

288
00:12:39,546 --> 00:12:41,887
But 12 years! How far did you come? Where did you start?

289
00:12:41,989 --> 00:12:43,960
Battery Park, five miles back.

290
00:12:44,103 --> 00:12:46,484
You've travelled five miles in 12 years?

291
00:12:46,628 --> 00:12:47,982
I think he's a bit slow.

292
00:12:49,583 --> 00:12:50,712
Where are you from?

293
00:12:51,451 --> 00:12:52,806
Never mind. I've got to get out.

294
00:12:53,123 --> 00:12:55,956
My friend's in one of these cars - she was taken hostage.
I should get back to the TARDIS.

295
00:12:57,331 --> 00:12:59,507
You're too late for that, 
we're past the lay-by.

296
00:13:00,586 --> 00:13:02,229
You're a passenger now, Sunny Jim.

297
00:13:02,475 --> 00:13:03,891
When's the next lay-by?

298
00:13:04,117 --> 00:13:05,184
Ooh,

299
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:06,847
six months.

300
00:13:13,852 --> 00:13:15,268
How many cars are out there?

301
00:13:15,474 --> 00:13:16,993
I don't think anyone knows.

302
00:13:18,183 --> 00:13:18,943
There we go.

303
00:13:19,251 --> 00:13:19,907
Hungry?

304
00:13:20,745 --> 00:13:21,940
Oh, thanks.

305
00:13:23,028 --> 00:13:25,122
But how far down is it to this Fast Lane?

306
00:13:25,450 --> 00:13:27,605
Right at the bottom, under the traffic jam.

307
00:13:27,749 --> 00:13:29,236
Not many people can afford three passengers,

308
00:13:29,237 --> 00:13:31,115
so it's empty down there.

309
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:33,784
Rumour has it you can reach up to 30mph!

310
00:13:33,948 --> 00:13:35,836
Wow, that's like, crazy(!)

311
00:13:36,821 --> 00:13:39,386
But how are you supposed to live inside this thing?
It's tiny.

312
00:13:39,509 --> 00:13:40,556
Oh, we stocked up!

313
00:13:41,192 --> 00:13:42,732
We've got self-replicating fuel,

314
00:13:42,835 --> 00:13:46,056
muscle stimulants for exercise, a chemical toilet at the back,

315
00:13:46,426 --> 00:13:49,279
and all waste products are recycled as food.

316
00:13:50,429 --> 00:13:51,496
OK.

317
00:13:51,632 --> 00:13:52,936
Another gap - this is brilliant!

318
00:13:53,846 --> 00:13:57,160
Car 465 Diamond 6 on descent to Fast Lane, thank you very much.

319
00:13:57,243 --> 00:13:58,289
#Please drive safely.#

320
00:14:00,834 --> 00:14:02,230
I need to talk to the police.

321
00:14:03,010 --> 00:14:05,827
'Thank you for your call.
    You have been placed on hold.'

322
00:14:05,904 --> 00:14:07,074
 You're the police!

323
00:14:07,177 --> 00:14:09,394
"Thank you for your call."
"You have been placed on hold.'"

324
00:14:11,753 --> 00:14:12,759
Is there anyone else?

325
00:14:12,821 --> 00:14:15,058
I once met the Duke of Manhattan.
Is there any way to contact him?

326
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:16,658
Oh, lordly!

327
00:14:16,679 --> 00:14:17,746
I have to find my friend!

328
00:14:17,808 --> 00:14:19,758
You can't make outside calls.

329
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,441
The Motorway's completely enclosed.

330
00:14:21,523 --> 00:14:22,672
What about the other cars?

331
00:14:22,755 --> 00:14:24,212
We have contact with them yet.

332
00:14:24,243 --> 00:14:25,105
"What's some of  the many way?"

333
00:14:25,167 --> 00:14:27,955
They must be on your Friends List.
Now, let's see, who's nearby?

334
00:14:31,058 --> 00:14:33,048
Be still your hearts, my handsome girls,

335
00:14:33,151 --> 00:14:34,239
it's Brannigan here.

336
00:14:34,341 --> 00:14:37,851
Get off the line, Brannigan, you're a pest and a menace.

337
00:14:37,913 --> 00:14:41,207
Come on, now, Sisters, 
is that any way to talk to an old friend?

338
00:14:41,555 --> 00:14:44,840
You know full well we're not sisters, we're married.

339
00:14:45,096 --> 00:14:47,601
Oooh, stop that modern talk, I'm an old-fashioned cat.

340
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:51,849
Now, I've got a hitchhiker here, calls himself the Doctor.

341
00:14:52,670 --> 00:14:55,975
I'm looking for someone called Martha Jones. 
She's been carjacked.

342
00:14:56,242 --> 00:14:58,130
She's inside one of these vehicles, but I don't know which one.

343
00:14:58,540 --> 00:14:59,300
Wait a minute!

344
00:15:01,434 --> 00:15:04,355
Could I ask, what entrance did they use?

345
00:15:04,493 --> 00:15:05,170
Where were we?

346
00:15:05,355 --> 00:15:05,991
Pharmacytown.

347
00:15:05,992 --> 00:15:07,798
Pharmacytown about 20 minutes ago.

348
00:15:08,036 --> 00:15:09,838
Let's have a look.

349
00:15:09,994 --> 00:15:12,407
Just my luck, to marry a carspotter.

350
00:15:12,601 --> 00:15:14,366
In the last half hour,

351
00:15:14,509 --> 00:15:18,389
 53 new cars joined from the Pharmacytown Junction.

352
00:15:18,512 --> 00:15:19,580
Anything more specific?

353
00:15:20,513 --> 00:15:22,258
All in good time.

354
00:15:22,566 --> 00:15:24,372
Was she carjacked by two people?

355
00:15:24,495 --> 00:15:25,337
Yes, she was, yeah.

356
00:15:25,911 --> 00:15:26,507
There we are.

357
00:15:26,609 --> 00:15:29,545
Just one of those cars was destined
for the Fast Lane.

358
00:15:29,729 --> 00:15:31,741
That means they
had three on board,

359
00:15:32,008 --> 00:15:35,175
and the Car number is 465 Diamond 6.

360
00:15:35,381 --> 00:15:36,633
That's it! So how do we find them?

361
00:15:36,863 --> 00:15:39,445
Ah, now, there, I'm afraid,
I can't help.

362
00:15:39,691 --> 00:15:41,744
 Can we call them?
We've got their number.

363
00:15:41,878 --> 00:15:44,792
Not if they're designated
Fast Lane, it's a different class.

364
00:15:45,383 --> 00:15:46,737
You could try the police.

365
00:15:47,045 --> 00:15:48,031
They put me on hold.

366
00:15:48,626 --> 00:15:51,007
You'll have to keep trying.
There's no-one else.

367
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:53,142
Thank you.

368
00:16:01,386 --> 00:16:02,083
Do you see?

369
00:16:02,391 --> 00:16:03,418
Another ten layers to go,

370
00:16:03,541 --> 00:16:04,321
and we're scorching.

371
00:16:09,751 --> 00:16:10,285
What's that?

372
00:16:12,296 --> 00:16:13,343
It's coming from underneath.

373
00:16:13,487 --> 00:16:14,698
It's that noise, isn't it?

374
00:16:14,996 --> 00:16:16,913
It's like Kate said.
The stories, they're true.

375
00:16:16,998 --> 00:16:17,941
What stories?

376
00:16:17,982 --> 00:16:20,137
It's the sound of the Air Vents, 
that's all.

377
00:16:20,443 --> 00:16:23,604
Exhaust fumes travel down to Air Vents 
at the base of the tunnel.

378
00:16:23,809 --> 00:16:25,657
No, but the stories are much better.

379
00:16:25,965 --> 00:16:28,797
They say people go missing on the Motorway.

380
00:16:28,961 --> 00:16:31,732
Some cars just vanish, never to be seen again.

381
00:16:31,834 --> 00:16:34,421
Cos there's something living down there,

382
00:16:34,606 --> 00:16:35,632
in the smoke.

383
00:16:36,289 --> 00:16:38,252
Something huge.

384
00:16:38,902 --> 00:16:40,219
And hungry.

385
00:16:41,122 --> 00:16:42,722
And if you get lost on the road,

386
00:16:43,112 --> 00:16:43,954
it's waiting for you.

387
00:16:50,173 --> 00:16:50,912
Like I said,

388
00:16:51,671 --> 00:16:52,615
Air Vents!

389
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:54,606
" That's the end of the next lay-by"

390
00:16:55,797 --> 00:16:57,275
Except, look out there.

391
00:16:57,747 --> 00:16:59,574
Does it look like the Air Vents are working?

392
00:17:00,097 --> 00:17:00,631
No.

393
00:17:05,776 --> 00:17:06,617
So what's that, then?

394
00:17:09,676 --> 00:17:10,374
Nah,

395
00:17:10,743 --> 00:17:11,544
kids' stuff.

396
00:17:12,488 --> 00:17:14,828
Car 465 Diamond 6 on descent.

397
00:17:15,258 --> 00:17:17,023
We've got go to the Fast Lane. Take me down.


398
00:17:17,434 --> 00:17:18,542
Not in a million years!

399
00:17:18,543 --> 00:17:19,856
You've got three passengers.

400
00:17:19,938 --> 00:17:21,334
I'm still not going!

401
00:17:21,354 --> 00:17:23,017
She's alone and she's lost.

402
00:17:23,099 --> 00:17:25,372
She doesn't even belong 
on this planet, and it's my fault.

403
00:17:26,111 --> 00:17:27,856
I'm asking you, Brannigan, take me down.

404
00:17:27,918 --> 00:17:29,899
That's a no, and that's final.

405
00:17:30,935 --> 00:17:32,536
I'm not risking the children down there.

406
00:17:33,357 --> 00:17:35,101
Why not? What happens down there?

407
00:17:35,122 --> 00:17:37,339
We're not discussing it.
The conversation is closed.

408
00:17:39,104 --> 00:17:40,130
So we keep on driving?

409
00:17:40,397 --> 00:17:41,054
Yes we do.

410
00:17:41,095 --> 00:17:42,101
For how long!?

411
00:17:42,244 --> 00:17:43,722
Till the journey's end.

412
00:17:46,452 --> 00:17:48,053
Mrs Cassini, this is the Doctor.

413
00:17:48,094 --> 00:17:49,962
How long have you been on the Motorway?

414
00:17:50,187 --> 00:17:51,891
Oh, we were amongst the first.

415
00:17:51,973 --> 00:17:54,128
It's been 23 years now.

416
00:17:54,518 --> 00:17:57,391
But in all that time, 
have you ever seen a police car?

417
00:18:01,059 --> 00:18:02,352
I'm not sure.

418
00:18:03,522 --> 00:18:04,487
Look at your notes.

419
00:18:05,021 --> 00:18:05,924
Any police?

420
00:18:07,238 --> 00:18:07,730
No.

421
00:18:07,956 --> 00:18:09,152
Not as such.

422
00:18:09,229 --> 00:18:10,255
Or an ambulance?

423
00:18:12,452 --> 00:18:13,103
Ever?

424
00:18:13,719 --> 00:18:15,320
I can't keep a note of everything.

425
00:18:15,977 --> 00:18:17,680
What if there's no-one out there?

426
00:18:17,865 --> 00:18:18,850
Stop it!

427
00:18:19,364 --> 00:18:20,698
The Cassinis were doing you a favour.

428
00:18:20,739 --> 00:18:21,868
Someone's got to ask.

429
00:18:22,237 --> 00:18:24,022
Cos you might not talk about it,
but it's there,

430
00:18:24,269 --> 00:18:25,644
in your eyes.

431
00:18:26,732 --> 00:18:28,846
What if the traffic jam never stops?

432
00:18:29,257 --> 00:18:30,817
There's a whole city above us -

433
00:18:31,022 --> 00:18:32,930
the mighty City State of New New York.

434
00:18:33,012 --> 00:18:34,326
They wouldn't just leave us.

435
00:18:34,408 --> 00:18:36,189
In that case, where are they? Hmm?

436
00:18:38,123 --> 00:18:40,197
What if there's no help coming, not ever?

437
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:42,228
What if there's nothing -

438
00:18:43,295 --> 00:18:44,506
just the Motorway,

439
00:18:44,887 --> 00:18:49,526
with the cars going round and round and round
and round, never stopping, for ever?

440
00:18:49,657 --> 00:18:50,498
Shut up!

441
00:18:50,909 --> 00:18:51,915
Just shut up!

442
00:18:52,818 --> 00:18:54,419
This is Sally Calypso

443
00:18:54,850 --> 00:18:56,061
and it's that time again.

444
00:18:57,128 --> 00:19:00,086
The sun is blazing high over the New Atlantic, 

445
00:19:00,702 --> 00:19:03,009
the perfect setting for the Daily Contemplation. 

446
00:19:03,275 --> 00:19:04,938
You think you know us so well, Doctor.

447
00:19:05,903 --> 00:19:07,134
We're not abandoned.

448
00:19:07,504 --> 00:19:08,797
Not while we have each other.

449
00:19:09,023 --> 00:19:11,095
This is for all of you out there on the roads. 

450
00:19:11,588 --> 00:19:12,963
We're so sorry. 

451
00:19:13,946 --> 00:19:14,951
Drive safe. 

452
00:19:16,256 --> 00:19:20,353
# On a hill, far away 

453
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:25,430
# Stood an old, rugged cross 

454
00:19:25,623 --> 00:19:33,731
# The emblem of suffering and shame

455
00:19:35,542 --> 00:19:40,530
# And I love that old cross

456
00:19:40,635 --> 00:19:45,292
# Where the dearest and best

457
00:19:45,486 --> 00:19:54,868
# For a world of lost sinners was slain

458
00:19:55,099 --> 00:20:04,245
# So I'll cherish the old, rugged cross, rugged cross

459
00:20:05,076 --> 00:20:13,961
# Till my trophies at last I lay down, I lay down

460
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:23,336
# I will cling to the old, rugged cross, rugged cross

461
00:20:23,683 --> 00:20:32,775
# And exchange it some day for a crown. #

462
00:20:39,031 --> 00:20:41,598
'Fast Lane access, please drive safely.'

463
00:20:41,675 --> 00:20:42,297
We made it.

464
00:20:42,606 --> 00:20:43,998
The Fast Lane.

465
00:20:53,855 --> 00:20:55,749
If you won't take me, I'll go down on my own.

466
00:20:56,798 --> 00:20:57,919
What do you think you're doing?

467
00:20:59,329 --> 00:21:00,412
Finding my own way.

468
00:21:00,508 --> 00:21:01,494
I usually do.

469
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:03,349
'Capsule open.'

470
00:21:06,721 --> 00:21:08,257
Here we go.

471
00:21:11,874 --> 00:21:12,802
Look after this.

472
00:21:14,127 --> 00:21:15,190
I love that coat.

473
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:17,045
Janis Joplin gave me that coat.

474
00:21:17,315 --> 00:21:18,726
But you can't jump!

475
00:21:19,170 --> 00:21:21,986
If it's any consolation, Valerie, 
right now, I'M having kittens.

476
00:21:22,295 --> 00:21:23,107
This Martha,

477
00:21:23,745 --> 00:21:25,117
she must mean an awful lot to you.

478
00:21:25,925 --> 00:21:26,640
Hardly know her.

479
00:21:27,441 --> 00:21:29,320
I was too busy showing off.

480
00:21:30,562 --> 00:21:31,567
And I lied to her.

481
00:21:32,017 --> 00:21:34,524
I couldn't help it, just lied.

482
00:21:35,766 --> 00:21:36,442
Bye, then!

483
00:21:44,645 --> 00:21:46,655
He's completely insane!

484
00:21:47,196 --> 00:21:50,132
That, and a bit magnificent!

485
00:21:52,472 --> 00:21:54,070
'Capsule open.'

486
00:21:55,061 --> 00:21:55,834
Who the hell are you?

487
00:21:55,911 --> 00:21:57,496
Sorry, Motorway Foot Patrol.

488
00:21:57,592 --> 00:21:59,641
I'm doing a survey. 
How are you enjoying your Motorway?

489
00:21:59,853 --> 00:22:03,435
Not very much. Junction five's
been closed for three years!

490
00:22:03,551 --> 00:22:05,686
Your comments have been noted.
Have a nice day.

491
00:22:17,211 --> 00:22:18,936
'Capsule open.'

492
00:22:23,627 --> 00:22:25,746
Thank you for your co-operation.
Your comments have been noted.

493
00:22:26,403 --> 00:22:27,447
Do you mind if I borrow this?

494
00:22:28,336 --> 00:22:30,687
Not my colour, but thank you very much.

495
00:22:32,953 --> 00:22:34,563
'Capsule open.'

496
00:22:35,210 --> 00:22:36,195
Don't mind me!

497
00:22:52,762 --> 00:22:53,574
Try again.

498
00:22:54,289 --> 00:22:56,182
'Brooklyn Turnoff One closed.'

499
00:22:56,279 --> 00:22:57,245
 Try the next one.

500
00:22:57,812 --> 00:22:59,906
'Brooklyn Turnoff Two closed.'

501
00:22:59,995 --> 00:23:01,097
What do we do?

502
00:23:01,802 --> 00:23:05,068
We'll do the whole loop. By the time
we come back round, they'll be open.

503
00:23:09,107 --> 00:23:10,161
You're still calling that Air Vents?

504
00:23:11,398 --> 00:23:12,210
What else could it be?

505
00:23:18,175 --> 00:23:19,258
What the hell is that?

506
00:23:19,335 --> 00:23:21,016
It's just...the hydraulics.

507
00:23:21,093 --> 00:23:22,991
Sounds like it's alive.

508
00:23:23,064 --> 00:23:25,143
It's all exhaust fumes out there,
nothing could breathe in that.

509
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:29,201
'Calling Car 465 Diamond 6.
Repeat, calling Car...'

510
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:31,481
This is 465 Diamond 6. Who's that?
Where are you?

511
00:23:31,558 --> 00:23:33,771
I'm in the Fast Lane, about
50 yards behind.

512
00:23:33,945 --> 00:23:36,187
Can you get back up,
off the Fast Lane?

513
00:23:36,361 --> 00:23:37,636
We only have permission to go down.

514
00:23:37,694 --> 00:23:38,950
We need the Brooklyn Flyover.

515
00:23:39,027 --> 00:23:40,399
It's closed. Go back up.

516
00:23:40,438 --> 00:23:41,665
We can't. We'll just go round.

517
00:23:42,071 --> 00:23:45,028
 Don't you understand? 
They're closed, 
they're always closed.

518
00:23:45,163 --> 00:23:49,119
We're stuck down here!
And there's something else out there,
in the fog. Can't you hear it?

519
00:23:50,776 --> 00:23:51,916
That's the Air Vents.

520
00:23:52,032 --> 00:23:54,312
Jehovah! What are you,
some stupid kid?

521
00:23:54,853 --> 00:23:55,858
Get out of here!

522
00:23:59,278 --> 00:24:00,167
What was that?

523
00:24:01,802 --> 00:24:04,225
I can't move, they've got us.

524
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:05,203
But what's happening?

525
00:24:05,281 --> 00:24:06,938
What's got you, what is it?

526
00:24:10,246 --> 00:24:11,010
Hello!

527
00:24:11,070 --> 00:24:13,623
Just drive, you idiots,
get out of here! Get out!

528
00:24:15,483 --> 00:24:17,396
Just drive!
Do what she said - 
get us out of here!

529
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:18,557
But where?

530
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:20,327
Straight ahead and fast!

531
00:24:21,072 --> 00:24:22,804
What is it?
What's out there?

532
00:24:22,892 --> 00:24:23,832
What is it?

533
00:24:29,048 --> 00:24:29,934
 'Scuse me, 

534
00:24:30,163 --> 00:24:31,082
is that legal?

535
00:24:31,158 --> 00:24:33,109
Sorry, Motorway Foot Patrol.

536
00:24:34,296 --> 00:24:35,457
Whatever. Have you got any water?

537
00:24:35,572 --> 00:24:38,946
Certainly. Never let it be said
I've lost my manners.

538
00:24:42,497 --> 00:24:43,481
Is this the last layer?

539
00:24:43,777 --> 00:24:44,837
We're right at the bottom.

540
00:24:44,969 --> 00:24:46,108
Nothing below us but the Fast Lane.

541
00:24:46,184 --> 00:24:47,101
Can we drive down?

542
00:24:47,243 --> 00:24:48,785
Both two of us.
You need three to go down.

543
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:49,594
Couldn't we just cheat?

544
00:24:49,627 --> 00:24:52,656
I'd love to, but it's an automated
system - the wheel would lock.

545
00:24:53,541 --> 00:24:54,850
If you'll excuse me.

546
00:24:56,356 --> 00:24:58,567
You can't jump,
it's a thousand feet down!

547
00:24:58,607 --> 00:24:59,954
No, I just want to look.

548
00:25:00,871 --> 00:25:02,430
What's that noise?

549
00:25:03,737 --> 00:25:04,283
I...

550
00:25:05,003 --> 00:25:06,310
I try not to think about it.

551
00:25:07,029 --> 00:25:08,380
What are those lights?

552
00:25:14,614 --> 00:25:15,720
I just need to see.

553
00:25:17,569 --> 00:25:19,235
There must be some sort of ventilation.

554
00:25:19,576 --> 00:25:22,350
If I could transmit a pulse through 
this thing, maybe I could trip the system,

555
00:25:22,967 --> 00:25:24,213
get a bit of a breeze.

556
00:25:27,872 --> 00:25:29,697
Just what we need - pirates!

557
00:25:30,364 --> 00:25:31,771
I'm calling the police!

558
00:25:34,358 --> 00:25:36,125
The Doctor - where is he?

559
00:25:38,478 --> 00:25:39,162
That's it!

560
00:25:39,222 --> 00:25:41,574
 Might shift the fumes a bit, give us a good look.

561
00:25:44,643 --> 00:25:45,869
What are those shapes?

562
00:25:47,517 --> 00:25:48,482
They're alive.

563
00:25:50,449 --> 00:25:52,298
What the hell are they?

564
00:25:57,639 --> 00:25:58,483
Macra.

565
00:26:04,371 --> 00:26:05,502
Go faster!

566
00:26:05,579 --> 00:26:07,189
I'm at top speed.

567
00:26:11,728 --> 00:26:13,376
'No access above.'

568
00:26:13,416 --> 00:26:15,065
But this is an emergency!

569
00:26:17,425 --> 00:26:19,650
'Thank you for your call.
You have been placed on hold.'

570
00:26:23,629 --> 00:26:24,353
Turn everything off!

571
00:26:24,453 --> 00:26:25,324
You've gotta be joking.

572
00:26:25,362 --> 00:26:27,871
No, listen, it's all fog out there, 
so how can they see us?

573
00:26:27,991 --> 00:26:29,499
Maybe it's the engines,

574
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:32,230
the sound or the heat. 

575
00:26:32,310 --> 00:26:34,419
Turn everything off. They might not find us.

576
00:26:39,902 --> 00:26:41,833
It can't be worse than this. Just do it!

577
00:27:06,656 --> 00:27:08,063
 They've stopped. 

578
00:27:08,968 --> 00:27:10,475
Yeah, but they're still out there.

579
00:27:13,005 --> 00:27:14,191
How did you think of that?

580
00:27:14,955 --> 00:27:16,161
Saw it on a film.

581
00:27:17,343 --> 00:27:18,790
They used to do it in submarines.

582
00:27:19,931 --> 00:27:22,122
Trouble is, I can't remember what they did next.

583
00:27:23,127 --> 00:27:24,313
You'd better think of something,

584
00:27:24,815 --> 00:27:25,720
cos we've lost the aircon.

585
00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:27,810
If we don't switch the engines back on, 
we won't be able to breathe.

586
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:29,736
How long have we got?

587
00:27:29,877 --> 00:27:32,570
Eight minutes - maximum.

588
00:27:36,906 --> 00:27:39,117
The Macra used to be the scourge of this galaxy.

589
00:27:39,519 --> 00:27:40,262
Gas, 

590
00:27:40,443 --> 00:27:42,192
they fed off gas, the filthier the better.

591
00:27:42,976 --> 00:27:46,487
They built an empire with Human
slaves, mining gas for food.

592
00:27:46,567 --> 00:27:49,207
They don't exactly look like
empire-builders to me. 

593
00:27:49,284 --> 00:27:51,623
Well, that was billions of years ago.

594
00:27:51,968 --> 00:27:54,963
Billions, they must've devolved down the
years and now they're just beasts.

595
00:27:56,471 --> 00:27:58,641
But they're still hungry
and my friend's down there.

596
00:28:00,410 --> 00:28:02,435
Oh, it's like New Times Square in here,

597
00:28:02,696 --> 00:28:03,922
for goodness' sake!

598
00:28:04,184 --> 00:28:05,430
I've invented a sport!

599
00:28:06,133 --> 00:28:06,877
Doctor,

600
00:28:07,159 --> 00:28:08,425
you're a hard man to find.

601
00:28:08,482 --> 00:28:10,093
No guns. I'm not having guns!

602
00:28:10,215 --> 00:28:11,978
I only brought this in case of pirates.

603
00:28:12,298 --> 00:28:13,042
Doctor,

604
00:28:13,283 --> 00:28:14,469
you've got to come with me.

605
00:28:14,810 --> 00:28:15,514
Do I know you?

606
00:28:16,519 --> 00:28:18,127
You haven't aged at all.

607
00:28:18,730 --> 00:28:20,720
Time has been less kind to me.

608
00:28:22,094 --> 00:28:23,179
Novice Hame!

609
00:28:23,943 --> 00:28:25,250
No! Hold on, get off!

610
00:28:25,632 --> 00:28:27,883
Last time we met, you were
breeding Humans for experimentation.

611
00:28:28,024 --> 00:28:29,792
I've sought forgiveness, Doctor,

612
00:28:30,195 --> 00:28:31,783
for so many years. . .

613
00:28:31,863 --> 00:28:33,109
under his guidance.

614
00:28:33,471 --> 00:28:34,657
And if you come with me,

615
00:28:34,918 --> 00:28:36,908
I might finally be able to redeem myself.

616
00:28:36,968 --> 00:28:39,374
I'm not going anywhere. You've got
Macra living under this city!

617
00:28:39,394 --> 00:28:41,684
Macra and my friend's stuck down there.

618
00:28:41,723 --> 00:28:43,696
You've got to come with me! Right now!

619
00:28:43,697 --> 00:28:44,560
 YOU'RE coming with ME.

620
00:28:44,566 --> 00:28:46,013
We've got three passengers, now!

621
00:28:46,073 --> 00:28:49,711
I'm sorry, Doctor. But the situation
is even worse than you can imagine.

622
00:28:50,958 --> 00:28:51,661
Transport.

623
00:28:51,701 --> 00:28:53,229
Don't you dare! Don't you dare!

624
00:28:57,118 --> 00:28:58,039
Oh!

625
00:28:59,666 --> 00:29:00,591
Rough teleport.

626
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:04,980
Ow! But you can go straight back out
and teleport people out, starting with Martha.

627
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:06,849
I only had the power for one trip.

628
00:29:06,990 --> 00:29:08,176
Then get some more!

629
00:29:08,256 --> 00:29:08,819
Where are we?

630
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:09,684
High above,

631
00:29:10,005 --> 00:29:11,151
in the Overcity.

632
00:29:11,554 --> 00:29:14,676
Good, cos you can tell the Senate
of New New York, I'd like a word!

633
00:29:14,737 --> 00:29:16,950
They've got millions
trapped on the Motorway!

634
00:29:16,970 --> 00:29:17,780
Millions!

635
00:29:17,861 --> 00:29:19,465
But you're inside the Senate,

636
00:29:19,830 --> 00:29:20,622
right now.

637
00:29:21,516 --> 00:29:23,526
May the Goddess Santori bless them.

638
00:29:28,838 --> 00:29:30,322
They died, Doctor.

639
00:29:34,743 --> 00:29:36,022
How long's it been like this?

640
00:29:36,408 --> 00:29:37,992
24 years.

641
00:29:45,371 --> 00:29:46,102
All of them?

642
00:29:46,650 --> 00:29:47,665
Everyone?
What happened?

643
00:29:47,868 --> 00:29:48,904
A new chemical,

644
00:29:49,615 --> 00:29:50,792
a new mood.

645
00:29:51,523 --> 00:29:53,150
They called it Bliss.

646
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:55,056
Everyone tried it.

647
00:29:55,625 --> 00:29:56,620
They couldn't stop.

648
00:29:57,249 --> 00:30:01,165
A virus mutated inside the compound
and became airborne.

649
00:30:02,262 --> 00:30:03,399
Everything perished,

650
00:30:03,985 --> 00:30:05,305
even the virus in the end.

651
00:30:07,132 --> 00:30:09,949
It killed the world
in seven minutes flat.

652
00:30:10,558 --> 00:30:15,350
There was just enough time to
close down the walkways and the
flyovers, sealing off the Undercity.

653
00:30:16,548 --> 00:30:19,247
Those people on the Motorway
aren't lost, Doctor.

654
00:30:19,835 --> 00:30:20,891
They were saved.

655
00:30:21,155 --> 00:30:23,246
So the whole thing
down there is running on automatic?


656
00:30:23,267 --> 00:30:25,135
There's not enough power to get them out.

657
00:30:25,236 --> 00:30:27,566
We did all we could to stop
the system from choking.

658
00:30:28,134 --> 00:30:29,576
Who's "we"? How did you survive?

659
00:30:30,124 --> 00:30:31,444
He protected me.

660
00:30:32,474 --> 00:30:35,682
And he has waited for you,
these long years.

661
00:30:36,778 --> 00:30:38,443
Doctor!

662
00:30:42,562 --> 00:30:43,618
The Face of Boe!

663
00:30:44,796 --> 00:30:46,699
I knew you would come.

664
00:30:47,836 --> 00:30:49,358
 Back in the old days,

665
00:30:49,622 --> 00:30:50,922
I was made his nurse,

666
00:30:51,470 --> 00:30:53,216
as penance for my sins.

667
00:30:53,663 --> 00:30:55,247
Old friend, what happened to you?

668
00:30:55,688 --> 00:30:57,170
Failing.

669
00:30:57,414 --> 00:31:01,028
He protected me from the
virus by shrouding me in his smoke.

670
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:04,642
But with no one to maintain it,
the City's power died.

671
00:31:05,228 --> 00:31:07,563
The Undercity would have fallen into the sea.

672
00:31:09,223 --> 00:31:10,278
So he saved them.

673
00:31:10,969 --> 00:31:13,527
The Face of Boe wired
himself into the mainframe.

674
00:31:14,583 --> 00:31:17,669
He's giving his life force
just to keep things running.

675
00:31:18,255 --> 00:31:20,326
But there are planets out there.
You could've called for help.

676
00:31:20,915 --> 00:31:23,955
The last act of the Senate was
to declare New Earth unsafe.

677
00:31:24,605 --> 00:31:27,488
 The automatic quarantine
lasts for 100 years.

678
00:31:33,858 --> 00:31:35,767
So the two of you stayed here...

679
00:31:38,366 --> 00:31:40,173
 ..on your own, for all these years.

680
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,157
We had no choice.

681
00:31:44,979 --> 00:31:45,852
Yes, you did.

682
00:31:48,005 --> 00:31:49,993
Save them, Doctor,

683
00:31:50,785 --> 00:31:52,348
save them!

684
00:31:58,901 --> 00:31:59,713
How much air's left?

685
00:32:02,738 --> 00:32:03,672
Two minutes.

686
00:32:07,159 --> 00:32:08,235
There's always the Doctor.

687
00:32:09,230 --> 00:32:10,184
That friend of mine.

688
00:32:11,464 --> 00:32:12,479
He might think of something.

689
00:32:13,590 --> 00:32:14,930
Martha, no-one's coming.

690
00:32:20,372 --> 00:32:21,570
 He looked kind of nice.

691
00:32:22,521 --> 00:32:23,618
He's a bit more than that.

692
00:32:24,891 --> 00:32:25,886
 Are you and him...?

693
00:32:26,054 --> 00:32:27,815
Sometimes, I think he likes me, but...

694
00:32:28,972 --> 00:32:30,922
sometimes I just think
he needs someone with him.

695
00:32:34,251 --> 00:32:35,490
I never even asked.

696
00:32:35,995 --> 00:32:36,685
Where's home?

697
00:32:38,431 --> 00:32:39,711
It's a long way away.

698
00:32:41,999 --> 00:32:45,147
I didn't really think,
I just followed the Doctor, and...

699
00:32:47,339 --> 00:32:48,883
They don't even know where I am,

700
00:32:50,037 --> 00:32:51,012
my mum and dad.

701
00:32:52,271 --> 00:32:54,545
If I died here, they'd never know.

702
00:32:57,181 --> 00:32:58,481
So, um, who is he, then,

703
00:32:59,166 --> 00:32:59,836
this Doctor?

704
00:33:01,744 --> 00:33:02,516
I don't know.

705
00:33:03,836 --> 00:33:04,729
Well, not really.

706
00:33:05,826 --> 00:33:07,795
There's so much he never says.

707
00:33:08,726 --> 00:33:09,884
 But that means that...

708
00:33:11,163 --> 00:33:12,868
the only hope, right now, is. . .

709
00:33:13,779 --> 00:33:14,877
a complete stranger.


710
00:33:19,003 --> 00:33:20,222
 Well, that's no use.

711
00:33:20,770 --> 00:33:21,785
 It is, though,

712
00:33:22,414 --> 00:33:24,181
because you haven't seen the things he can do.

713
00:33:24,831 --> 00:33:25,440
Honestly,

714
00:33:25,683 --> 00:33:26,496
just trust me,

715
00:33:26,821 --> 00:33:27,450
both of you.

716
00:33:27,942 --> 00:33:28,936
You've got your faith,

717
00:33:29,018 --> 00:33:30,784
you've got your songs and your hymns.

718
00:33:31,799 --> 00:33:32,794
And I've got the Doctor.

719
00:33:37,201 --> 00:33:37,930
 Right.

720
00:33:40,549 --> 00:33:42,864
'Systems back on line.'

721
00:33:46,376 --> 00:33:47,086
 Good luck.

722
00:33:47,432 --> 00:33:48,102
And you.

723
00:33:56,934 --> 00:33:59,759
 Car 465 Diamond 6,
it still registers! That's Martha.

724
00:33:59,881 --> 00:34:01,485
I knew she was good!
Novice Hame,

725
00:34:01,587 --> 00:34:02,582
hold that in place.

726
00:34:03,740 --> 00:34:08,552
 Think, think, think! Take the
residual energy, invert it,  feed
it through the Electricity Beds.

727
00:34:08,553 --> 00:34:09,706
There isn't the power.

728
00:34:09,746 --> 00:34:11,777
You've got power. You've got me!

729
00:34:11,834 --> 00:34:13,459
I'm brilliant with computers.
Just, just watch!

730
00:34:13,479 --> 00:34:15,997
 Hame, every switch on that bank,
up to maximum!

731
00:34:21,383 --> 00:34:24,496
 I can't power up the City,
but all the City needs is people.

732
00:34:24,862 --> 00:34:26,100
So what are you going to do?

733
00:34:26,626 --> 00:34:27,377
This!

734
00:34:29,407 --> 00:34:31,986
No, no, no, no, no, no!

735
00:34:46,528 --> 00:34:49,121
The transformers are blocked,
the signal can't get through.

736
00:34:49,669 --> 00:34:50,461
Doctor...

737
00:34:50,502 --> 00:34:51,862
Yeah, hold on, not now.

738
00:34:52,126 --> 00:34:54,542
I give you my last...

739
00:35:00,957 --> 00:35:01,932
Hame, look after him.

740
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:04,734
Don't you go dying on me, 
you big old face!

741
00:35:04,775 --> 00:35:06,054
You've got to see this.

742
00:35:07,375 --> 00:35:08,594
The open road! Hah!

743
00:35:11,355 --> 00:35:12,368
What in Jehovah was that?!

744
00:35:12,489 --> 00:35:13,667
It's coming from above.

745
00:35:13,870 --> 00:35:15,555
What is it? What's happening?

746
00:35:18,636 --> 00:35:19,651
Hold on, May.

747
00:35:23,590 --> 00:35:25,093
By all the Cats in the Kingdom...!

748
00:35:29,054 --> 00:35:29,643
What is it?

749
00:35:38,676 --> 00:35:39,407
What is it?

750
00:35:46,830 --> 00:35:48,426
It's the sun!

751
00:35:49,055 --> 00:35:50,883
 Oh, Brannigan!

752
00:35:51,938 --> 00:35:52,913
Children!

753
00:35:53,136 --> 00:35:55,228
It's the sunlight.

754
00:35:55,735 --> 00:35:58,456
Sorry, no Sally Calypso,
she was just a hologram.

755
00:35:58,552 --> 00:35:59,689
My name's the Doctor.


756
00:35:59,771 --> 00:36:00,684
He's a magician.

757
00:36:00,867 --> 00:36:01,943
And this is an order.

758
00:36:02,428 --> 00:36:03,605
Everyone, drive up!

759
00:36:04,296 --> 00:36:05,149
- Right now!
- Is he serious?

760
00:36:05,392 --> 00:36:06,915
I've opened the roof of the
Motorway, come on!

761
00:36:07,153 --> 00:36:09,711
Throttle those engines. Drive up,

762
00:36:10,199 --> 00:36:12,554
all of you. The whole Undercity. Drive up,

763
00:36:12,635 --> 00:36:13,529
drive up,

764
00:36:13,530 --> 00:36:14,036
Here we go.

765
00:36:14,077 --> 00:36:16,369
drive up!
We've got to clear that Fast Lane.

766
00:36:16,450 --> 00:36:17,973
Drive up and get out of the way.

767
00:36:20,842 --> 00:36:23,807
Oi! Car 465 Diamond 6.
Martha,

768
00:36:23,868 --> 00:36:24,660
drive up!

769
00:36:25,330 --> 00:36:26,183
That's the Doctor!

770
00:36:26,203 --> 00:36:27,563
We can't go up, we'll hit the layer.

771
00:36:27,604 --> 00:36:28,883
Do as he says, go up!

772
00:36:29,127 --> 00:36:31,178
 You've got access above!
Now, go!

773
00:36:44,110 --> 00:36:45,227
It's daylight!

774
00:36:46,831 --> 00:36:50,039
Oh, my God,
that's the sky, the real sky!

775
00:36:50,953 --> 00:36:51,866
He did it!

776
00:36:53,808 --> 00:36:55,230
I told you, he did it!

777
00:37:04,217 --> 00:37:05,456
 Did I tell you, Doctor?

778
00:37:05,659 --> 00:37:08,359
You're not bad, sir. You're not bad at all!

779
00:37:16,041 --> 00:37:18,741
You keep driving, Brannigan,
all the way up!

780
00:37:19,168 --> 00:37:20,244
Cos it's here,

781
00:37:20,508 --> 00:37:21,746
just waiting for you,

782
00:37:22,394 --> 00:37:24,324
 the City of New New York. 
And it's yours.

783
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:26,901
And don't forget, I want that coat back.

784
00:37:27,632 --> 00:37:29,704
'I reckon that's a fair bargain, sir.'

785
00:37:30,069 --> 00:37:33,337
And Car 465 Diamond 6,
I've sent you a flight path.
Come to the Senate.

786
00:37:33,398 --> 00:37:34,413
'On my way!'

787
00:37:34,981 --> 00:37:36,646
It's been quite a while since
I saw you, Martha Jones.

788
00:37:36,768 --> 00:37:37,743
Doctor!

789
00:38:00,668 --> 00:38:01,338
Doctor!

790
00:38:03,612 --> 00:38:04,221
Over here.

791
00:38:05,074 --> 00:38:06,902
Doctor, what happened out there?

792
00:38:10,197 --> 00:38:11,252
What's that?

793
00:38:11,537 --> 00:38:12,836
The Face of Boe. It's all right.

794
00:38:13,689 --> 00:38:14,460
Come and say hello.

795
00:38:14,948 --> 00:38:15,780
And this is Hame,

796
00:38:16,186 --> 00:38:17,506
she's a cat. Don't worry.

797
00:38:19,618 --> 00:38:21,263
He's the one that saved you, not me.

798
00:38:21,628 --> 00:38:23,195
My lord gave his life . . .

799
00:38:23,479 --> 00:38:24,596
to save the City.

800
00:38:26,342 --> 00:38:27,641
And now he's dying.

801
00:38:28,413 --> 00:38:29,611
No, don't say that.

802
00:38:29,652 --> 00:38:31,499
Not old Boe. Plenty of life left.

803
00:38:31,966 --> 00:38:34,728
It's good to breathe the air once more.

804
00:38:36,169 --> 00:38:37,103
Who is he?

805
00:38:39,743 --> 00:38:40,982
I don't even know.

806
00:38:42,159 --> 00:38:45,164
Legend says the Face of Boe 
has lived for billions of years.

807
00:38:46,728 --> 00:38:47,540
Isn't that right?

808
00:38:48,779 --> 00:38:50,423
And you're not about to give up now.

809
00:38:50,687 --> 00:38:53,083
Everything has its time.

810
00:38:53,976 --> 00:38:56,718
You know that, 
old friend, better than most.

811
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:58,443
The legend says more.

812
00:38:58,687 --> 00:38:59,946
Don't, there's no need for that.

813
00:39:00,230 --> 00:39:03,398
It says the Face of Boe will speak
his final secret . . .

814
00:39:04,108 --> 00:39:05,063
to a traveller.

815
00:39:05,261 --> 00:39:06,946
Yeah, but not yet.
Who needs secrets, eh?

816
00:39:07,860 --> 00:39:10,012
I have seen so much.

817
00:39:10,606 --> 00:39:12,738
Perhaps too much.

818
00:39:13,449 --> 00:39:15,601
I am the last of my kind...

819
00:39:16,556 --> 00:39:20,901
 ..as you are the last of yours, Doctor.

820
00:39:22,227 --> 00:39:23,770
That's why we have to survive.

821
00:39:25,688 --> 00:39:26,601
Both of us.

822
00:39:28,835 --> 00:39:29,586
Don't go.

823
00:39:29,870 --> 00:39:31,048
 I must.

824
00:39:31,576 --> 00:39:33,342
But know this, Time Lord.

825
00:39:34,175 --> 00:39:36,087
YOU are not . . .

826
00:39:36,493 --> 00:39:37,732
alone.

827
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:20,416
 All closed down.

828
00:40:21,228 --> 00:40:21,939
Happy?

829
00:40:22,711 --> 00:40:23,705
Happy happy.

830
00:40:25,228 --> 00:40:26,528
New New York can start again.

831
00:40:27,381 --> 00:40:28,294
And they've got Novice Hame.

832
00:40:29,228 --> 00:40:31,015
Just what every city needs - cats in charge!

833
00:40:31,096 --> 00:40:32,622
Come on, time we were off.

834
00:40:33,736 --> 00:40:34,731
But what did he mean,

835
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:35,990
the Face of Boe?

836
00:40:36,761 --> 00:40:37,735
You're not alone.

837
00:40:38,140 --> 00:40:38,871
I don't know.

838
00:40:40,820 --> 00:40:41,571
You've got me,

839
00:40:42,424 --> 00:40:43,277
is that what he meant?

840
00:40:45,652 --> 00:40:46,404
I don't think so.

841
00:40:48,164 --> 00:40:48,692
 Sorry.

842
00:40:50,438 --> 00:40:50,966
Then what?

843
00:40:51,694 --> 00:40:52,303
Doesn't matter.

844
00:40:52,973 --> 00:40:53,988
Back to the TARDIS, off we go.

845
00:41:00,729 --> 00:41:01,663
All right. You staying?

846
00:41:01,927 --> 00:41:03,409
Till you talk to me properly, yes.

847
00:41:04,181 --> 00:41:06,049
He said "last of your kind".
What does that mean?

848
00:41:06,211 --> 00:41:07,443
It really doesn't matter.

849
00:41:07,463 --> 00:41:09,534
You don't talk. You never say.

850
00:41:10,016 --> 00:41:10,726
Why not?

851
00:41:11,475 --> 00:41:16,689
# Fast falls the eventide... #

852
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:17,772
It's the city.

853
00:41:18,264 --> 00:41:21,561
# . . .The darkness . . .#

854
00:41:21,637 --> 00:41:22,519
They're singing.

855
00:41:22,634 --> 00:41:24,397
#. . .deepens. . . #

856
00:41:25,318 --> 00:41:31,955
# Lord, with me abide

857
00:41:32,629 --> 00:41:38,533
# When other helpers fail... #

858
00:41:38,753 --> 00:41:39,829
I lied to you...

859
00:41:41,007 --> 00:41:41,961
cos I liked it.

860
00:41:44,009 --> 00:41:45,004
I could pretend.

861
00:41:46,486 --> 00:41:49,001
Just for a bit, I could 
imagine they were still alive,

862
00:41:50,341 --> 00:41:52,044
underneath a burnt orange sky.

863
00:41:55,252 --> 00:41:56,647
I'm not just a Time Lord.

864
00:41:59,165 --> 00:42:00,383
I'm the last of the Time Lords.

865
00:42:03,328 --> 00:42:04,708
The Face of Boe was wrong,
there's no-one else.

866
00:42:06,956 --> 00:42:07,748
What happened?

867
00:42:20,662 --> 00:42:22,084
There was a war.

868
00:42:24,752 --> 00:42:25,686
A Time War -

869
00:42:26,823 --> 00:42:28,407
the Last Great Time War.

870
00:42:29,727 --> 00:42:32,306
My people fought a race
called the Daleks,

871
00:42:33,298 --> 00:42:34,597
for the sake of all creation.

872
00:42:35,064 --> 00:42:36,100
And they lost.

873
00:42:38,430 --> 00:42:38,999
We lost,

874
00:42:39,547 --> 00:42:40,460
everyone lost.

875
00:42:45,252 --> 00:42:46,207
They're all gone now.

876
00:42:47,907 --> 00:42:48,739
My family,

877
00:42:50,323 --> 00:42:51,196
my friends,

878
00:42:51,541 --> 00:42:52,536
even that sky.

879
00:42:54,926 --> 00:42:56,713
Oh, you should've seen it, 
that old planet.


880
00:43:01,870 --> 00:43:05,319
The second sun would
rise in the south,
and the mountains would shine.

881
00:43:08,191 --> 00:43:09,926
The leaves on the trees were silver,

882
00:43:11,974 --> 00:43:15,182
and when they caught the light every morning,
it looked like a forest on fire.

883
00:43:17,567 --> 00:43:18,786
When the autumn came,

884
00:43:19,496 --> 00:43:23,100
# . . .The darkness deepens. . . #
-the breeze would blow through the branches
 like a song...

885
00:43:23,368 --> 00:43:29,042
# Lord, with me abide... #

886
00:43:35,419 --> 00:43:36,435
It's the Statue of Liberty.

887
00:43:36,536 --> 00:43:38,343
I always wanted to go to New York.

888
00:43:39,713 --> 00:43:43,144
It's the Depression, sweetie.
Your heart might break
but the show goes on.

889
00:43:43,226 --> 00:43:44,870
"Hooverville mystery deepens".

890
00:43:45,073 --> 00:43:46,048
Arm yourselves!

891
00:43:46,144 --> 00:43:46,895
Come on!

892
00:43:46,976 --> 00:43:48,195
Who are we working for?

893
00:43:48,702 --> 00:43:49,819
Behold your masters!

894
00:43:50,164 --> 00:43:51,687
What do you mean, "creatures"?

895
00:43:53,027 --> 00:43:54,022
What the hell was that?

896
00:43:54,124 --> 00:43:54,872

RUN!

898
00:43:57,326 --> 00:43:59,600

899
00:43:59,620 --> 00:44:00,128
Where's Martha?

900
00:44:02,158 --> 00:44:04,087
He's insane! He's inhuman!

901
00:44:05,890 --> 00:44:08,637
They always survive, while I lose everything.
