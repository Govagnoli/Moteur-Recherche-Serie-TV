Good morning, Adipose Industries.

Adipose Industries.

00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,230
The 21st century way to lose weight.

9
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:30,660
No exercise, no diet, no pain.

10
00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:36,170
just lifelong freedom from fat, the Holy Grail of the modern age.

11
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:38,650
And here it is.

12
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:41,120
You just take one capsule.

13
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:44,210
One capsule, once a day, for three weeks.

14
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,990
And the fat, as they say...

15
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:50,010
'The fat just walks away.

16
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,810
' Excuse me, Miss Foster, if I could?

17
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,990
I am Penny Carter, Science Correspondent for the Observer.

18
00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:00,740
There are a thousand diet pills in the market, 
a thousand conmen stealing people's money.

19
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:04,000
How do we know the fat isn't going 
straight into your bank account?

20
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:08,080
Oh, Penny.If cynicism burnt up calories, 
we'd all be thin as rakes.

21
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:13,070
But if you want the science, I can oblige.

22
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:16,520
'Adipose Industries.

23
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:24,490
'The Adipose Capsule is composed of a synthesised mobilising lipase, 
'bound to a large protein molecule.

24
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:31,380

100% legal, 100% effective.

28
00:02:40,210 --> 00:02:43,520
But can Ijust ask, how many people 
have taken the pills to date?

29
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:51,180
We've already got one million customers 
within the Greater London area alone.

30
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:55,260
But from next week, we start rolling out nationwide.

31
00:02:56,170 --> 00:02:58,400
The future starts here.

32
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:03,510
And Britain will be thin.

33
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:06,430
Good morning, I represent Adipose Industries.

34
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:07,160
Good morning, I represent Adipose Industries.

35
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:08,890
Good morning, I represent Adipose Industries.

00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,640
Good morning, I represent Adipose Industries.

37
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:19,030
That's a three-week course of pills for 
the special price of ?l??

38
00:03:23,690 --> 00:03:26,850
We deliver within three working days.

39
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:31,410
The box comes with 21 days' worth of pills, 
a full information pack, 

40
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:35,860
and our special free gift, an Adipose Industries pendant.

41
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:39,520
It's made of 18-carat gold, 
and it's yours for free.

42
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:42,490
No, we don't give away pens. Sorry.

43
00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:45,140
No, I can't make an exception, no.

44
00:03:45,970 --> 00:03:47,450
I'll need to keep this for testing.

45
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:49,770
And Ijust need a list of your customers.

46
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:50,630
Could you print it off?

47
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:51,740
I suppose so.

48
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:53,090
Where's the printer?

49
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:54,890
just over there, by the plant.

50
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:56,740
Which plant, that plant?

51
00:03:57,530 --> 00:03:58,300
Yeah, that's the one.

52
00:03:58,680 --> 00:03:59,290
Lovely.

53
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,290
That's the printer there?

54
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:01,090
- By the plant, yeah.
- Really?

55
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:04,280
Does it need a code?
Last place I worked, the printer needed a code.

56
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:05,400
No, I can do it from here.

57
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,060
Has it got paper?

58
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:08,480
Yeah, jimbo keeps it stocked.

59
00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:10,210
Excuse me, everyone.

60
00:04:10,610 --> 00:04:12,150
If I could have your attention.

61
00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:18,260
0n average, you're each selling 40 Adipose packs per day.

62
00:04:18,650 --> 00:04:20,150
It's not enough.

63
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:23,760
I want 100 sales per person, per day.

64
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:26,970
And if not, you'll be replaced.

65
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:31,000
Cos if anyone's good at trimming the fat, it's me.

66
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,360
Now.

67
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,220
Back to it.

68
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:40,390
Anyway, If you could print that off, thanks.

69
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:42,840
So if you could print off that list, 
I'll get out of your way.

70
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,000
Lovely.

71
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:46,020
Thanks, then.

72
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:47,040
- See you!
- Thanks, then.

73
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:48,680
Ooh, what's that?

74
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:50,090
My telephone number.

75
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:51,880
- What for?
- Health and Safety.

76
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,160
You be health.I'll be safety.

77
00:04:56,690 --> 00:04:59,870
But that contravenes paragraph 5, subsection C.

78
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:00,830
Sorry.

79
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:11,760
Me again!

80
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:15,340
Stacy Campbell?

81
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:16,370
Who wants to know?

82
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:22,300
My name's Donna, I represent Adipose Industries, 
and you're on the list of our valued customers.

83
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:24,790
Mr Roger Davey!

84
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:28,100
I'm calling on behalf of Adipose Industries, 
just need to ask you a few questions.

85
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:29,030
It's been fantastic.

86
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:30,710
I started the pills on Thursday.

87
00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:33,280
Five days later, I've lost 11 pounds.

88
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:37,210
And no side effects or anything?

89
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:38,840
No, I feel fantastic.

90
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:39,890
It's a new lease of life.

91
00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:42,300
Now what do you think about these earrings, do they work?

92
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:43,960
Yeah, lovely.

93
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:48,110
I've been on the pills two weeks now, 
I've lost 14 kilos.

94
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,880
The same amount every day?

95
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:51,400
One kilo exactly.

96
00:05:51,770 --> 00:05:53,440
You wake up, and it's disappeared overnight.

97
00:05:54,210 --> 00:05:57,590
Well, technically speaking, 
it's gone by ten past one in the morning.

98
00:05:58,870 --> 00:05:59,540
What makes you say that?

99
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:01,940
That's when I get woken up.

100
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:03,990
Might as well weigh myself at the same time!

101
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:05,840
Are you going on a date?

102
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:08,450
I'm doing the opposite, I'm dumping him!

103
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:09,620
I can do better than him now.

104
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:12,150
Right, I won't be long.

105
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,570
If the taxi beeps, give me a shout.

106
00:06:14,790 --> 00:06:15,910
It is driving me mad.

107
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:23,760
Ten minutes past one, every night, bang on the dot without fail, 
the burglar alarm goes off.

108
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:28,040
I've had experts in, I've had it replaced, 
I've even phoned Watchdog.

109
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:28,580
But no!

110
00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:31,130
Ten past one in the morning, off it goes.

111
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:32,780
- But with no burglars?
- Nothing!

112
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:33,870
I've given up looking.

113
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:36,970
Tell me, Roger.
Have you got a cat flap?

114
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:39,520
It was here when I bought the house.

115
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:40,930
I've never bothered with it.

116
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:42,780
I'm not a cat person.

117
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:44,650
No, I've met cat people.

118
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,380
You're nothing like them.

119
00:06:46,890 --> 00:06:47,730
Is that what it is?

120
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,110
Cats getting inside the house?

121
00:06:50,170 --> 00:06:55,210
Well, the thing about cat flaps is they don't just let things in, 
they let things out as well.

122
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:57,620
Like what?

123
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:01,020
The fat just walks away.

124
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,180
Won't be long!

125
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:05,250
That's all right.

126
00:07:44,450 --> 00:07:45,960
We have unscheduled parthenogenesis.

127
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:48,310
Well, thanks for your help.

128
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:51,160
Tell you what, maybe you could lay off 
the pills for a week or so.

129
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:54,790
Gotta go, sorry!

130
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,050
Send out the Collection Squad.

131
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:01,980
Bring them home.

132
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:18,030
You all right up there?

133
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:20,880
Yeah.

134
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,360
The Adipose has been witnessed.

135
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:31,560
'Activating full parthenogenesisl

136
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:55,960
What are you?

137
00:08:57,510 --> 00:08:58,450
What are you?

138
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:00,120
I like what y0u've done with the hall.

139
00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:03,050
Stacy?

140
00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:07,340
Are you all right?

141
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:11,860
I wouldn't mind a little visit myself.

142
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:15,810
Everything all right in there?

143
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:22,060
 It's only me.

144
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:24,260
Do you mind if I pop to the loo?

145
00:09:26,090 --> 00:09:26,870
Stacy?

146
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:31,380
Help me!

147
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:32,910
0h, my God, help me!

148
00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:34,080
What is it? What's wrong?

149
00:09:36,970 --> 00:09:37,680
Stacy!

150
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:25,500
Stacy Campbell?

151
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,700
- She's gone.
- Gone where?

152
00:11:29,090 --> 00:11:30,030
She'sjust gone.

153
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:32,520
Oh, great Thanks for nothing.

154
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:58,020
It seems we have a case of industrial espionage.

155
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:02,820
One touch and the capsule bio-tunes itself to its owner,

156
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:06,890
but someone must have introduced a second, raw capsule.

157
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:11,090
Therefore, one of these people is a thief.

158
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:13,690
There!

159
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:16,990
0h, yes.There she is.

160
00:12:17,930 --> 00:12:18,690
Now...

161
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:24,220
What shall we do with her?

162
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:35,410
And what time's this?

163
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:37,440
How old am I?

164
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,450
Not old enough to use a phone.

165
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:44,750
I thought you were only moving back for a couple of weeks.

166
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:45,930
Look at you!

167
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:48,980
You're never gonna find a flat, not while you're on the dole.

168
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:55,860
It's no good sitting there dressed up looking 
like you're job-hunting, y0u've got to do something.

169
00:12:56,270 --> 00:12:57,930
It's not like the 1980s.

170
00:12:58,090 --> 00:13:00,640
No-one's unemployed these days, except you.

171
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:03,710
How long did that job with Health and Safety last?

172
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:07,020
Two days, and then you walk out.

173
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:09,150
'I have other plans.

174
00:13:10,110 --> 00:13:11,140
' Well, I've not seen them.

175
00:13:11,850 --> 00:13:16,960
And it's no good sitting there dreaming, no-one's gonna come along 
with a magic wand and make your life all better.

176
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:19,130
Where's Grandad?

177
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:21,360
Where d'you think he is?

178
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,710
Up the hill!
He's always up the hill!

179
00:13:31,930 --> 00:13:32,800
Here comes trouble.

180
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:35,260
Permission to board ship, sir.

181
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:36,300
Permission granted.

182
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:38,590
Was she nagging you?

183
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:40,070
Big time.

184
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:41,960
Brought you a Thermos.

185
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:42,980
0h, ta.

186
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:44,850
You seen anything?

187
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:51,110
Yeah, I've got Venus, with an apparent magnitude of minus 3.5

188
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:53,270
At least, that's what it says in my little book.

189
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,050
Here, come and see. come on

190
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:56,220
Here you go

191
00:13:58,050 --> 00:13:58,650
Right?

192
00:14:00,850 --> 00:14:04,850
That's the only planet in the solar system named after a woman.

193
00:14:06,650 --> 00:14:07,280
Good for her.

194
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:10,410
How far away is that?

195
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:13,910
It's about 26 million miles.

196
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:17,240
But we'll get there one day.

197
00:14:18,330 --> 00:14:21,260
100 years' time, we'll be striding out amongst the stars, 

198
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:25,100
jiggling about with all them aliens, just you wait.

199
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,280
You really believe in all that stuff, don't you?

200
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:32,050
They're all over the place these days.

201
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:34,030
If I wait here long enough...

202
00:14:35,090 --> 00:14:36,630
Don't suppose you've seen a little blue box?

203
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:39,400
Is that slang for something?

204
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:42,550
No, I mean it.

205
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:49,160
If you ever see a little blue box flying up there in the sky, 
you shout for me, Gramps.

206
00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:51,650
0h, you just shout.

207
00:14:55,650 --> 00:14:58,130
D'you know, I don't understand half the things you say these days.

208
00:14:59,730 --> 00:15:01,900
- Nor me.
- No, fair dos.

209
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:04,810
You've had a funny old time of it lately.

210
00:15:06,130 --> 00:15:08,740
There was poor old whats his name, Lance, bless him.

211
00:15:10,030 --> 00:15:11,350
That barmy old Christmas.

212
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:15,580
I wish you'd tell us what really happened.

213
00:15:16,650 --> 00:15:17,480
I know.

214
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,200
It's just...

215
00:15:21,070 --> 00:15:21,940
The things I've seen.

216
00:15:22,890 --> 00:15:24,140
Sometimes I think I'm going mad.

217
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:26,230
I mean, even tonight, I was in a...

218
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:30,640
Doesn't matter.

219
00:15:32,050 --> 00:15:33,540
Well, you're not yourself, I'll give you that.

220
00:15:35,190 --> 00:15:37,250
You just...You seem to be drifting, sweetheart.

221
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:39,030
I'm not drifting.

222
00:15:41,570 --> 00:15:42,280
I'm waiting.

223
00:15:42,850 --> 00:15:45,840
- What for?
- The right man.

224
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:49,950
Same old story.

225
00:15:50,590 --> 00:15:51,520
A man!

226
00:15:52,210 --> 00:15:53,890
No, I don't mean like that.

227
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:56,310
But he's real.

228
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:58,970
I've seen him.I've met him.
just once.

229
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:03,020
And then I let him fly away.

230
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:05,580
Well, there you are.Go and find him.

231
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:07,030
I've tried.

232
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:09,830
He's nowhere.

233
00:16:11,410 --> 00:16:12,380
Not like you to give up.

234
00:16:13,950 --> 00:16:18,650
I remember when you was about six years old, 
your mother said, 'No holiday this year.

235
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:23,270
' So off you toddled all on your own, and you got on a bus to Strathclyde!

236
00:16:24,490 --> 00:16:26,440
We had the police out and everything!

237
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,190
Where's she gone, then?

238
00:16:31,130 --> 00:16:32,120
Where's that girl?

239
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:34,600
You're right.

240
00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:39,050
Cos he's still out there, somewhere.

241
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:42,020
And I'll find him, Gramps.

242
00:16:44,310 --> 00:16:45,750
Even if I have to wait 100 years...

243
00:16:47,890 --> 00:16:48,690
I'll find him.

244
00:16:53,990 --> 00:16:55,290
Oh, fascinating.

245
00:16:56,610 --> 00:16:58,940
Seems to be a bioflip digital stitch, specifically for...

246
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,750
It's my turn for the car.
What do you need it for?

247
00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:25,170
A quick get away.

248
00:18:06,650 --> 00:18:07,220
Morning!

249
00:18:30,950 --> 00:18:32,390
Keep an eye out.She'll come back.

250
00:18:33,870 --> 00:18:36,170
And then she's mine.

251
00:18:46,690 --> 00:18:47,950
See you???

252
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:14,060
I need the car.

253
00:19:14,230 --> 00:19:14,980
Where are you?

254
00:19:15,890 --> 00:19:17,230
I can't. I'm busy.

255
00:19:17,450 --> 00:19:18,360
Why are you whispering?

256
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:19,950
I am in church.

257
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:22,230
What are you doing in church?

258
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:24,690
Praying

259
00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:26,310
Bit late for that, madam.

260
00:19:26,630 --> 00:19:28,120
What is she ?? for

261
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:29,610
Hush, you!Go up the hill.

262
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:33,060
But I need the car.

263
00:19:33,190 --> 00:19:34,140
I'm going out with Suzette.

264
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:36,140
She's asked all the Wednesday girls.

265
00:19:46,050 --> 00:19:49,750
We know you're in here, so why don't you make 
this nice and easy and show yourself?

266
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:54,820
I'm waiting.

267
00:19:55,810 --> 00:19:57,510
I warn you, I'm not a patient woman.

268
00:19:57,510 --> 00:19:59,180
Now, out you come.

269
00:20:00,510 --> 00:20:04,650
Right, we'll do it the hard way.

270
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:06,710
Get her!

271
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:19,160
There you are.

272
00:20:21,330 --> 00:20:25,190
I've been through the records, Foster, 
and all of your results have been faked.

273
00:20:25,450 --> 00:20:27,590
There's something about those pills 
you're not telling us.

274
00:20:27,590 --> 00:20:30,880
0h, I think I'll be conducting this interview, Penny.

275
00:20:56,710 --> 00:20:57,880
You've got no right to do this.

276
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:59,220
Let me go!

277
00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:16,610
This is ridiculous.

278
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,240
Sit there.

279
00:21:21,610 --> 00:21:22,750
I'm phoning my editor.

280
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:23,950
I said sit.

281
00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:27,750
'You can't tie me up!

282
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:29,520
' What sort of a country do you think this is?

283
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:32,540
Oh, it's a beautifully fat country.

284
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:36,050
I've travelled a long way to find obesity on this scale.

285
00:21:36,050 --> 00:21:38,060
So come on, then, Miss Foster.

286
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:41,410
Those pills, what are they?

287
00:21:41,410 --> 00:21:44,960
Well, you might as well have a scoop, 
since you'll never see it printed.

288
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:51,200
This is the spark of life.

289
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:53,190
And what's that supposed to mean?

290
00:21:53,190 --> 00:21:57,810
Officially, the capsule attracts 
all the fat cells and flushes them away.

291
00:21:57,810 --> 00:21:58,960
Well, it certainly attracts them.

292
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:01,010
That part's true.

293
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:04,930
But it binds the fat together 
and galvanises it to form a body.

294
00:22:04,930 --> 00:22:07,270
Well, what do you mean 'a body'?

295
00:22:07,270 --> 00:22:09,580
I am surprised you never asked about my name.

296
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:11,330
I chose it well.

297
00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:16,910
Foster, as in foster mother.

298
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:20,310
And these...

299
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:24,660
are my children.

300
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:26,290
You're kidding me.

301
00:22:26,690 --> 00:22:28,550
What the hell is that?

302
00:22:28,550 --> 00:22:30,350
Adipose.

303
00:22:32,030 --> 00:22:36,770
It's called an Adipose.

304
00:22:36,770 --> 00:22:39,860
Made out of living fat.

305
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,020
Are we interrupting you?

306
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:58,940
Get her!

307
00:24:00,970 --> 00:24:02,450
And him!

308
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,260
What about me?

309
00:24:37,870 --> 00:24:42,010
Oh, my God, I don't believe it!

310
00:24:42,010 --> 00:24:43,790
You've even got the same suit.

311
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:46,210
Don't you ever change?

312
00:24:46,210 --> 00:24:48,460
Yeah, thanks Donna, not right now.

313
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:54,190
just like old times!

314
00:24:57,380 --> 00:24:59,100
Cos I thought, 'How do you find the Doctor?

315
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:01,670
' Then I thought, 'Look for trouble, and he'll turn up.

316
00:25:01,670 --> 00:25:07,200
' I looked everywhere, you name it- UF0 sightings, 
crop circles, sea monsters...

317
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,330
I found them all.

318
00:25:08,330 --> 00:25:11,610
Like the bees disappearing, 
I thought, 'He's connected.

319
00:25:11,610 --> 00:25:14,810
' Cos the thing is, Doctor, 
I believe it all now.

320
00:25:14,810 --> 00:25:16,250
You opened my eyes.

321
00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:19,060
All those amazing things out there, 
I believe them all.

322
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:22,710
Apart from that replica of the Titanic flying over Buckingham Palace.

323
00:25:22,710 --> 00:25:24,010
That's a hoax.

324
00:25:24,010 --> 00:25:25,720
What do you mean, the bees are disappearing?

325
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:27,880
That's what it says on the internet.

326
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:32,180
There were conspiracy theories about Adipose Industries, 
so I thought I'd look.

327
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:33,040
In you get!

328
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:34,130
What, in that thing?

329
00:25:34,130 --> 00:25:37,590
But they'll just call us back up again.

330
00:25:37,590 --> 00:25:39,230
I've locked the controls with a sonic cage.

331
00:25:39,230 --> 00:25:40,850
Only I can control it.

332
00:25:40,850 --> 00:25:42,320
Not unless she's got a sonic device.

333
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:44,020
Which is very unlikely.

334
00:25:44,590 --> 00:25:46,200
Out of my way.

335
00:26:07,370 --> 00:26:09,490
0h, I don't think so.

336
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:31,320
Come on.

337
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:33,130
We can get in through the window.

338
00:26:33,130 --> 00:26:34,690
Deadlock the building.

339
00:26:34,690 --> 00:26:36,770
Can't get it open!

340
00:26:39,060 --> 00:26:40,730
We'll smash it, then!

341
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:58,010
She's cutting the cable!

342
00:27:02,190 --> 00:27:03,690
Donna!

343
00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:06,620
Doctor!

344
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:08,370
Hold on!

345
00:27:08,370 --> 00:27:10,290
I am!

346
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:19,830
Doctor!

347
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:25,390
And now for the other one.

348
00:27:56,330 --> 00:27:58,160
I'm going to fall!

349
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:03,910
What the hell is going on?

350
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:06,740
This is all your fault.

351
00:28:07,390 --> 00:28:09,490
I should've stayed at home!

352
00:28:09,490 --> 00:28:11,220
I won't be a minute!

353
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:19,860
Yes, he's slippery, that one.

354
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:22,220
Time we found out who he is.

355
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:37,050
Is anyone gonna tell me what's going on?

356
00:28:37,050 --> 00:28:38,000
You ajournalist?

357
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,200
Yes.

358
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,680
Well, make it up.

359
00:28:41,290 --> 00:28:42,800
Get off!

360
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:43,730
I've got you.

361
00:28:43,730 --> 00:28:44,690
I've got you.

362
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:46,680
Stop kicking!

363
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:54,020
I was right.

364
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:55,510
It's always like this with you, innit?

365
00:28:55,510 --> 00:28:56,380
Oh, yes!

366
00:28:56,380 --> 00:28:57,980
And off we go!

367
00:29:00,530 --> 00:29:01,780
Sorry!

368
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:06,250
Now do yourself a favour, get out.

369
00:29:11,370 --> 00:29:12,910
Well, then.

370
00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:16,600
At last.

371
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:17,320
Hello.

372
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:18,960
Nice to meet you. I'm the Doctor.

373
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:20,080
And I'm Donna.

374
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:21,620
Partners in crime.

375
00:29:22,210 --> 00:29:26,420
And evidently off-worlders, judging by your sonic technology.

376
00:29:26,420 --> 00:29:27,620
0h, yes!

377
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:29,980
I've still got your sonic pen.

378
00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:31,290
Nice! I like it.

379
00:29:31,290 --> 00:29:33,090
Sleek, it's kind of sleek.

380
00:29:33,090 --> 00:29:34,380
Oh, it's definitely sleek.

381
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:38,080
And if you were to sign your real name, 
that would be?

382
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:41,810
Matron Cofelia, of the Five-Straighten Classabindi Nursery Fleet.

383
00:29:41,810 --> 00:29:43,460
Intergalactic Class.

384
00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:45,110
A wet nurse.

385
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:47,950
Using humans as surrogates.

386
00:29:47,950 --> 00:29:54,150
I've been employed by the Adiposian first family to foster 
a new generation after their breeding planet was lost.

387
00:29:54,150 --> 00:29:56,290
How do you lose a planet?

388
00:29:56,290 --> 00:29:58,470
Oh, the politics are none of my concern.

389
00:29:58,470 --> 00:30:01,950
I'm just here to take care of the 
children on behalf ofthe parents.

390
00:30:01,950 --> 00:30:04,140
What, like an outer space Supernanny?

391
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:05,860
Yes, if you like.

392
00:30:06,450 --> 00:30:07,840
So.

393
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:11,620
So those little things, 
they're made out of fat, yeah?

394
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:14,640
But that woman, Stacy Campbell, 
there was nothing left of her.

395
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:19,330
0h, in a crisis, the Adipose can convert 
bone and hair and internal organs.

396
00:30:19,630 --> 00:30:22,510
Makes them a little bit sick, poor things.

397
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:25,520
What about poor Stacy?

398
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:29,340
Seeding a level five planet is against galactic law.

399
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:32,520
Are you threatening me?

400
00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:35,210
I'm trying to help you, Matron.

401
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:37,870
This is your one chance.

402
00:30:37,870 --> 00:30:42,570
Cos if you don't call this off, 
then I'll have to stop you.

403
00:30:42,570 --> 00:30:45,330
I hardly think you can stop bullets.

404
00:30:45,330 --> 00:30:46,890
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

405
00:30:46,890 --> 00:30:49,030
One more thing - before dying.

406
00:30:49,030 --> 00:30:54,000
Do you know what happens if you hold two 
identical sonic devices against each other?

407
00:30:55,350 --> 00:30:56,170
No.

408
00:30:56,170 --> 00:30:57,060
Nor me.

409
00:30:57,060 --> 00:30:58,290
Let's find out.

410
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:06,500
Come on!

411
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:11,750
I'm advancing the birth plan.

412
00:31:11,750 --> 00:31:13,750
We're going into premature labour.

413
00:31:15,910 --> 00:31:17,960
Cellular bossification.

414
00:31:20,250 --> 00:31:21,720
Tie her up.

415
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:24,700
Oh, you're kidding me.

416
00:31:35,540 --> 00:31:36,340
That's one solution.

417
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:37,600
Hide in a cupboard.

418
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:39,080
I like it!

419
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:40,300
I've been hacking into this all day, 

420
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:44,670
cos the Matron's got a computer core running 
through the building, triple-deadlocked.

421
00:31:44,670 --> 00:31:47,780
But now I've got this, I can get into it.

422
00:31:53,390 --> 00:31:55,070
What does that thing do?

423
00:31:55,430 --> 00:31:57,130
It's the inducer.

424
00:31:57,990 --> 00:32:00,110
We had planned to seed millions.

425
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:04,180
But if that man's an alien and 
he's alerted the Shadow Proclamation, 

426
00:32:04,180 --> 00:32:07,360
then the first one million humans will have to do.

427
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:09,820
Find him, and the woman.

428
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:11,980
Don't waste time, just kill them.

429
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:15,640
She's wired up the whole building.

430
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:19,290
And we need a bit of privacy.

431
00:32:22,870 --> 00:32:24,810
just enough to stun them.

432
00:32:24,810 --> 00:32:27,210
But why's she wired up a tower block?

433
00:32:27,210 --> 00:32:29,250
What's it all for?

434
00:32:36,890 --> 00:32:39,240
'Inducer online.

435
00:32:42,410 --> 00:32:43,910
' You look older.

436
00:32:43,910 --> 00:32:45,350
Thanks.

437
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:47,240
Still on your own?

438
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:48,490
Yep.

439
00:32:48,850 --> 00:32:50,030
Well, no.

440
00:32:50,030 --> 00:32:52,310
I had this friend. Martha, she was called

441
00:32:52,310 --> 00:32:54,400
Martha jones. She was brilliant.

442
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:57,800
And I destroyed half her life.

443
00:32:58,850 --> 00:33:00,650
But she's fine, she's good.

444
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:03,300
She's gone.

445
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:06,110
What about Rose?

446
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:08,690
Still lost.

447
00:33:10,070 --> 00:33:12,480
I thought you were gonna travel the world.

448
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,960
Easier said than done.

449
00:33:15,710 --> 00:33:19,250
It's like, I had that one day 
with you and I was gonna change.

450
00:33:19,250 --> 00:33:21,550
I was gonna do so much.

451
00:33:22,370 --> 00:33:26,780
And then I woke up the next morning, same old life.

452
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:30,600
It's like you were never there.

453
00:33:31,450 --> 00:33:34,550
And I tried, I did try.

454
00:33:34,550 --> 00:33:35,730
I went to Egypt.

455
00:33:35,730 --> 00:33:37,920
I was gonna go barefoot and everything.

456
00:33:39,210 --> 00:33:41,910
Then it's all bus trips and guidebooks 
and don't drink the water, 

457
00:33:41,910 --> 00:33:44,440
and two weeks later, you're back at home.

458
00:33:46,290 --> 00:33:47,950
It's nothing like being with you.

459
00:33:49,410 --> 00:33:51,150
I must've been mad, turning down that offer.

460
00:33:51,150 --> 00:33:52,560
What offer?

461
00:33:53,330 --> 00:33:54,870
To come with you.

462
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:57,630
You're coming with me?

463
00:33:58,070 --> 00:33:59,780
0h, yes, please!

464
00:34:01,170 --> 00:34:02,670
Right.

465
00:34:02,670 --> 00:34:04,840
'Inducer activated.

466
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:05,970
' What's it doing now?

467
00:34:05,970 --> 00:34:07,790
She started the program.

468
00:34:08,850 --> 00:34:11,400
'Inducer transmitting.

469
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:14,130
' Mark the date, Miss Carter.

470
00:34:14,130 --> 00:34:16,050
Happy birthday.

471
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:21,620
One million birthdays.

472
00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:27,720
I swear, that Adipose treatment is fabulous.

473
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:29,610
just look at my chin.

474
00:34:30,050 --> 00:34:33,090
And it's very good for back fat, 
I'm down two sizes.

475
00:34:33,090 --> 00:34:34,840
It's like a miracle.

476
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:37,190
All that from just one little pill.

477
00:34:37,190 --> 00:34:39,000
And I've been eating like normal.

478
00:34:41,530 --> 00:34:42,410
You all right, love?

479
00:34:42,410 --> 00:34:45,570
Yeah, I'm just.

480
00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:49,460
Funny sort of feeling, like it's.

481
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:50,610
What's happened?

482
00:34:50,610 --> 00:34:51,560
I'm not sure.

483
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:52,940
it just seems to be...

484
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:55,780
Better pop to the loo.

485
00:34:56,950 --> 00:34:59,210
- Oh, my God, Suzette!
- What?

486
00:35:04,070 --> 00:35:05,140
What is it?

487
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:07,590
Get it off me!

488
00:36:13,550 --> 00:36:15,680
Come to me, children.

489
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:18,290
Come to me.

490
00:36:18,890 --> 00:36:21,560
Everyone get back, don't touch them.

491
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:33,650
So far they're just losing weight, 

492
00:36:33,650 --> 00:36:35,900
but the Matron's gone up to emergency parthenogenesis.

493
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:37,120
And that's when they convert?

494
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:38,970
Skeletons, organs, everything.

495
00:36:38,970 --> 00:36:40,590
A million people are gonna die!

496
00:36:49,410 --> 00:36:51,130
Gotta cancel the signal.

497
00:36:52,330 --> 00:36:53,950
This contains the primary signal.

498
00:36:53,950 --> 00:36:56,660
If I can switch it off, 
the fat goes back to being just fat.

499
00:36:57,390 --> 00:36:59,030
A nice try.

500
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:01,010
Double strength.

501
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:04,440
'Inducer increasing.

502
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:05,750
' No, no, no, no, no, she's doubled it, I need.

503
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:08,000
Haven't got time.

504
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,970
It's too far, I can't override it.

505
00:37:10,410 --> 00:37:11,960
They're all gonna die!

506
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:17,320
Is there anything I can do?

507
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:18,820
Sorry, this is way beyond you.

508
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:20,690
Gotta double the base pulse...

509
00:37:20,690 --> 00:37:22,990
Doctor, tell me, what do you need?

510
00:37:22,990 --> 00:37:25,990
I need a second capsule to boost the override, 
but I've only got the one.

511
00:37:25,990 --> 00:37:27,710
I can't save them!

512
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:48,590
It's stopped.

513
00:37:49,940 --> 00:37:51,710
They've gone.

514
00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:08,550
What's happened?

515
00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:13,950
I think the Doctor happened.

516
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:18,280
But we've still given birth to 10,000 Adipose.

517
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:21,160
And the Nursery is coming.

518
00:38:24,110 --> 00:38:25,800
What the hell was that?

519
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:29,330
It s my lift home.

520
00:38:34,490 --> 00:38:36,740
You can't just leave me here!

521
00:38:37,850 --> 00:38:39,670
It just stopped.

522
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:46,120
What on earth is it now?

523
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:49,520
Oh, my god.

524
00:39:15,470 --> 00:39:16,920
Fine.

525
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:19,580
When you say 'nursery', 
you don't mean a creche in Notting Hill?

526
00:39:19,580 --> 00:39:21,530
Nursery ship.

527
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:24,570
'Incoming signal.

528
00:39:28,580 --> 00:39:30,400
Hadn't we better go and stop them?

529
00:39:30,940 --> 00:39:34,320
Instructions from the Adiposian first family.

530
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:36,000
Children!

531
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:39,740
0h, my children, be hold.

532
00:39:40,310 --> 00:39:43,880
I am taking you home.

533
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:49,610
Far across the galaxy, your new mummies 
and daddies are waiting.

534
00:39:49,610 --> 00:39:52,220
And you will fly!

535
00:39:56,170 --> 00:39:58,460
Up you go, babies.

536
00:39:58,660 --> 00:40:00,460
Up you go!

537
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:07,330
That's it, fly away home!

538
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:11,030
She's wired up the tower block to 
convert it into a levitation post.

539
00:40:15,550 --> 00:40:18,320
We're not the ones in trouble now.

540
00:40:19,030 --> 00:40:20,630
She is!

541
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,860
Take me.

542
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:29,340
The children need me!

543
00:40:40,350 --> 00:40:42,250
What you gonna do, then?

544
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:43,840
Blow them up?

545
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:44,520
They're just children.

546
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:46,510
They can't help where they came from.

547
00:40:46,510 --> 00:40:49,000
That makes a change from last time.

548
00:40:49,950 --> 00:40:52,190
That Martha must've done you good.

549
00:40:53,890 --> 00:40:55,730
Ah, she did.

550
00:40:55,730 --> 00:40:58,820
Yeah, yeah, she did.

551
00:40:59,820 --> 00:41:01,640
She fancied me.

552
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:03,610
Mad Martha, that one.

553
00:41:03,610 --> 00:41:04,440
Blind Martha.

554
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:06,030
Charity Martha.

555
00:41:11,950 --> 00:41:14,120
I'm waving at fat.

556
00:41:15,060 --> 00:41:18,020
Actually, as a diet plan, it sort of works.

557
00:41:18,020 --> 00:41:19,460
There she is!

558
00:41:23,210 --> 00:41:25,460
Matron Cofelia, listen to me!

559
00:41:25,460 --> 00:41:27,750
0h, I don't think so, Doctor.

560
00:41:27,750 --> 00:41:30,580
And if I never see you again, it'll be too soon.

561
00:41:30,580 --> 00:41:31,720
Why does no-one ever listen?

562
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:32,700
I'm trying to help!

563
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:34,020
just get across to the roof.

564
00:41:34,020 --> 00:41:35,440
Can you shift the levitation beam?

565
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:38,260
What, so that you can arrest me?

566
00:41:38,260 --> 00:41:42,890
I saw the Adiposian instructions - 
they know it's a crime, breeding on earth.

567
00:41:42,890 --> 00:41:44,670
So what's the one thing they want to get rid of?

568
00:41:44,670 --> 00:41:46,270
Their accomplice!

569
00:41:46,270 --> 00:41:48,920
I'm far more than that.

570
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:53,890
I'm nanny to all these children.

571
00:41:53,890 --> 00:41:58,150
????Mum and Dad have got the kids now, 
they don't need the nanny anymore.

572
00:42:25,350 --> 00:42:27,270
Oi, you two!

573
00:42:27,270 --> 00:42:28,890
You're just mad.

574
00:42:28,890 --> 00:42:30,030
Do you hear me?

575
00:42:30,030 --> 00:42:31,060
Mad!

576
00:42:31,060 --> 00:42:32,690
And I'm gonna report you for...

577
00:42:33,150 --> 00:42:34,820
madness!

578
00:42:39,090 --> 00:42:42,460
You see, some people just can't take it.

579
00:42:44,380 --> 00:42:46,580
NOPe` And some people can.

580
00:42:46,990 --> 00:42:48,270
So, then...

581
00:42:48,270 --> 00:42:49,880
Tardis!

582
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:51,320
Come on!

583
00:42:53,260 --> 00:42:54,910
That's my car!

584
00:42:57,160 --> 00:42:58,760
That is like destiny.

585
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:01,330
And I've been ready for this.

586
00:43:01,330 --> 00:43:03,660
I packed ages ago, just in case.

587
00:43:03,660 --> 00:43:09,600
Cos I thought, hot weather, cold weather, no weather - 

588
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:13,400
he goes anywhere, I've gotta be prepared.

589
00:43:14,410 --> 00:43:17,690
You've got a hatbox.

590
00:43:18,390 --> 00:43:21,470
Planet of the Hats, I'm ready!

591
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:23,860
Do I need injections?

592
00:43:23,860 --> 00:43:26,940
Like when you go to Cambodia, is there any of that?

593
00:43:26,940 --> 00:43:29,380
Cos my friend Veena went to Bahrain, and...

594
00:43:32,120 --> 00:43:33,950
You're not saying much.

595
00:43:34,670 --> 00:43:36,130
No, it's just.

596
00:43:38,750 --> 00:43:42,870
It's a funny old life, in the Tardis.

597
00:43:42,870 --> 00:43:44,560
You don't want me.

598
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:46,370
I'm not saying that.

599
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:49,790
But you asked me.

600
00:43:52,420 --> 00:43:54,440
Would you rather be on your own?

601
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:55,980
No.

602
00:43:55,980 --> 00:43:57,390
Actually, no.

603
00:43:57,390 --> 00:43:58,680
But...

604
00:44:03,350 --> 00:44:07,960
The last time, with Martha, like I said...

605
00:44:09,570 --> 00:44:11,370
it got complicated.

606
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:16,870
And that was all my fault.

607
00:44:20,610 --> 00:44:22,690
I just want a mate.

608
00:44:23,780 --> 00:44:25,880
You just want T0 MATE?

609
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:27,940
I just want A mate!

610
00:44:27,940 --> 00:44:29,770
You're not mating with me, sunshine!

611
00:44:29,770 --> 00:44:32,940
A mate, I want a mate!

612
00:44:33,270 --> 00:44:35,730
just as well, because I'm not having any of that nonsense.

613
00:44:35,730 --> 00:44:40,300
I mean, you're just a long streak of nothing, alien nothing.

614
00:44:40,300 --> 00:44:41,590
There we are, then.

615
00:44:42,330 --> 00:44:43,660
OK.

616
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:48,120
I can come?

617
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:49,370
Yeah.

618
00:44:49,370 --> 00:44:50,810
Course you can, yeah.

619
00:44:52,770 --> 00:44:54,300
I'd love it.

620
00:44:54,770 --> 00:44:56,800
Ohh, that's just...

621
00:44:57,320 --> 00:44:58,090
Car keys!

622
00:44:58,090 --> 00:44:59,200
What?

623
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:00,820
I've still got my mum's car keys!

624
00:45:00,820 --> 00:45:02,260
I won't be a minute.

625
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:15,370
I know, Mum, I saw it, little fat people.

626
00:45:15,370 --> 00:45:16,520
I've got to go.

627
00:45:16,520 --> 00:45:17,960
I'm going to stay with Veena for a bit.

628
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:18,890
'It was in the sky.

629
00:45:18,890 --> 00:45:21,080
' I know, spaceship.

630
00:45:21,080 --> 00:45:23,250
But I've still got the car keys.

631
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:28,380
There's a bin on Brook Street 30 feet from the corner, I'm going to leave them in there.

632
00:45:28,380 --> 00:45:29,420
'What? A bin?

633
00:45:29,420 --> 00:45:30,770
' Yes, I said 'bin'.

634
00:45:30,770 --> 00:45:31,600
'You can't do that.

635
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:33,920
Oh, stop complaining, the car'sjust down the road a bit.

636
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:36,610
Got to go, really got to go.

637
00:45:36,610 --> 00:45:37,280
Bye.

638
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:38,870
'But Donna, you can't...

639
00:45:40,780 --> 00:45:45,500
' There's this woman that's going to come along, tall blond woman called Sylvia, 

640
00:45:45,500 --> 00:45:47,530
tell her that bin there.

641
00:45:47,530 --> 00:45:48,500
It'll make sense.

642
00:45:48,500 --> 00:45:50,000
That bin there.

643
00:46:18,630 --> 00:46:19,920
Off we go, then!

644
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:22,250
Here it is, the Tardis.

645
00:46:22,420 --> 00:46:24,240
Bigger on the inside than it is on the outside.

646
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:25,970
0h, I know all that bit.

647
00:46:26,690 --> 00:46:29,900
Although frankly, you could turn the heating up.

648
00:46:29,900 --> 00:46:33,560
So, whole wide universe

649
00:46:34,700 --> 00:46:36,230
where do you want to go?

650
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:38,880
I know exactly the place.

651
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:40,180
Which is?

652
00:46:40,900 --> 00:46:42,830
Two and a half miles that way.

653
00:46:53,100 --> 00:46:54,420
Donna!

654
00:46:54,420 --> 00:46:56,270
It's the flying blue box!

655
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:04,360
What?

656
00:47:06,790 --> 00:47:08,180
That's Donna.

657
00:47:08,180 --> 00:47:10,230
That's Donna.

658
00:47:11,030 --> 00:47:12,290
And that's him!

659
00:47:12,290 --> 00:47:13,570
That's him!

660
00:47:17,490 --> 00:47:18,930
Go on, girl!

661
00:47:18,930 --> 00:47:21,670
Go on, get up there!

662
00:47:22,140 --> 00:47:23,760
Hey...

663
00:47:28,760 --> 00:47:30,020
Ancient Rome.

664
00:47:30,020 --> 00:47:31,510
This is fantastic.

665
00:47:31,510 --> 00:47:33,850
It has come, the blue box.

666
00:47:33,850 --> 00:47:35,980
I see the most terrible things.

667
00:47:36,420 --> 00:47:38,490
The prophecies of women are limited and dull.

668
00:47:38,490 --> 00:47:41,570
Only the menfolk have the capacity for true perception.

669
00:47:41,570 --> 00:47:43,510
I tell you where the wind's blowing now.

670
00:47:43,510 --> 00:47:46,420
Doctor, you bring bad luck.

671
00:47:46,420 --> 00:47:49,890
We are building the future as dictated by the gods.

672
00:47:49,890 --> 00:47:52,140
I demand you tell me who you are.

673
00:47:52,140 --> 00:47:53,160
Doctor!

674
00:47:53,160 --> 00:47:55,150
The sky is falling.

675
00:47:55,150 --> 00:47:56,600
We're in Pompeii!

676
00:47:57,320 --> 00:47:59,090
And it's volcano day.

677
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


678
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
