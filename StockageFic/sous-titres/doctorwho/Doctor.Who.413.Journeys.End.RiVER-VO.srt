1
00:00:01,972 --> 00:00:04,227
The Tardis is in the same place
but the Earth has gone.

2
00:00:04,404 --> 00:00:05,790
<i>Exterminate!</i>

3
00:00:11,191 --> 00:00:13,670
Welcome to my new empire.

4
00:00:14,107 --> 00:00:16,248
Ladies and gentlemen, we are at war.

5
00:00:16,348 --> 00:00:18,550
Exterminate Torchwood!

6
00:00:25,873 --> 00:00:27,550
I surrender! I'm sorry!

7
00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:29,816
The Doctor is coming.

8
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:34,030
He's dying, and you know
what happens next.

9
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:34,917
He can't.

10
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:37,690
- What do you mean, what happens next?
- I'm regenerating.

15
00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:36,990
Now then. Where were we?

16
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,708
Exterminate. Exterminate.

17
00:01:48,442 --> 00:01:49,364
Mickey?

18
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:51,562
Us Smiths gotta stick together!

19
00:01:51,662 --> 00:01:54,910
Jackie Tyler. Rose's mum.
Now where the hell is my daughter?!

20
00:02:25,258 --> 00:02:26,430
What the hell?

21
00:02:27,577 --> 00:02:28,584
There now...

22
00:02:33,098 --> 00:02:34,110
You see?

23
00:02:34,992 --> 00:02:36,890
Used the regeneration energy
to heal myself,

24
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:40,039
but as soon as that was done,
I didn't need to change, why would I?

25
00:02:40,139 --> 00:02:40,769
Look at me!

26
00:02:40,869 --> 00:02:43,748
To stop the energy going all the way,
I siphoned off the rest

27
00:02:43,848 --> 00:02:46,146
into a bio-matching receptacle,
namely, my hand,

28
00:02:46,508 --> 00:02:48,710
my hand there, my handy spare hand!

29
00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:51,908
Remember, Christmas Day,
Sycorax, lost my hand in a swordfight?

30
00:02:52,078 --> 00:02:53,227
<i>That's my hand.</i>

31
00:02:53,971 --> 00:02:55,085
What d'you think?

32
00:02:59,723 --> 00:03:00,482
You...

33
00:03:00,702 --> 00:03:01,921
You're still you?

34
00:03:03,426 --> 00:03:04,321
I'm still me.

35
00:03:11,756 --> 00:03:13,338
You can hug me, if you want.

36
00:03:14,785 --> 00:03:16,350
No, really, you can hug me.

37
00:03:22,037 --> 00:03:24,930
<i>It's a Time Lock!
The ultimate defence programme.</i>

38
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:28,484
Tosh was working on it, I never
thought she finished it, but she did!

39
00:03:29,122 --> 00:03:31,975
The Hub's sealed in a time bubble,
nothing can get in!

40
00:03:32,589 --> 00:03:33,908
But that means we can't get out.

41
00:03:34,008 --> 00:03:36,215
Nope.
Not without unlocking that Dalek.

42
00:03:36,852 --> 00:03:38,348
We're trapped inside.

43
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:39,760
It's all up to Jack now.

44
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:42,611
Report! Tardis has been located!

45
00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:44,291
Bring it here!

46
00:03:44,391 --> 00:03:46,816
Bring the Doctor to me!

47
00:03:47,022 --> 00:03:49,630
Initiate temporal prison!

48
00:03:52,622 --> 00:03:55,361
Temporal prison initiated!

49
00:03:59,686 --> 00:04:02,143
They've got us! Power's gone!

50
00:04:03,902 --> 00:04:05,590
Some kind of chronon loop.

51
00:04:07,803 --> 00:04:10,750
Transferring Tardis to the Crucible.

52
00:04:18,489 --> 00:04:20,577
Those teleport things,
can we use them?

53
00:04:21,116 --> 00:04:24,578
If they've taken the Doctor to the Dalek
spaceship, that's where we need to be.

54
00:04:24,925 --> 00:04:27,074
It's not just a teleport,
it's a Dimension Jump.

55
00:04:27,174 --> 00:04:29,205
It rips a hole in the fabric of space.

56
00:04:29,305 --> 00:04:30,213
But can we use it?

57
00:04:30,313 --> 00:04:32,992
Not yet, it burns up energy,
needs half an hour between jumps.

58
00:04:33,092 --> 00:04:35,192
- Then put down your guns.
- Do what?

59
00:04:35,525 --> 00:04:38,011
If you're carrying a gun,
they'll shoot you dead.

60
00:04:40,748 --> 00:04:41,910
Daleks!

61
00:04:42,607 --> 00:04:43,698
<i>I surrender!</i>

62
00:04:43,798 --> 00:04:48,528
All humans in this Sector
will be taken to the Crucible!

63
00:04:48,628 --> 00:04:50,644
- She's bloody mad!
- Yeah, but Mickey,

64
00:04:50,744 --> 00:04:53,013
if they've got the Doctor,
then they've got Rose.

65
00:04:55,107 --> 00:04:57,632
And us! We surrender!

66
00:05:02,746 --> 00:05:06,649
Jack's explained the base code,
I know how the teleport works. I think.

67
00:05:07,118 --> 00:05:09,373
But you stay indoors,
there's no Daleks on this street,

68
00:05:09,473 --> 00:05:11,374
you should be OK, just keep quiet.

69
00:05:11,594 --> 00:05:12,934
But where are you going?

70
00:05:13,034 --> 00:05:15,683
I'm a member of UNIT.
They gave me the Osterhagen Key.

71
00:05:15,783 --> 00:05:17,691
I've got to do my job.

72
00:05:18,259 --> 00:05:18,932
I'm sorry.

73
00:05:19,804 --> 00:05:20,570
Martha.

74
00:05:21,053 --> 00:05:22,556
What's an Osterhagen Key?

75
00:05:23,528 --> 00:05:24,341
<i>Tell me.</i>

76
00:05:24,989 --> 00:05:26,194
<i>What does it do?</i>

77
00:05:26,712 --> 00:05:27,870
Love you.

78
00:05:32,102 --> 00:05:34,630
GERMANY
60 miles outside Nuremberg.

79
00:05:36,389 --> 00:05:39,311
<i>Exterminieren! Exterminieren!</i>

80
00:05:39,411 --> 00:05:40,162
<i>Halt!</i>

81
00:05:40,262 --> 00:05:42,915
<i>Sonst werden wir Sie exterminieren!</i>

82
00:05:43,015 --> 00:05:46,003
<i>Sie sind jetzt
ein Gefangener der Daleks!</i>

83
00:05:49,407 --> 00:05:52,397
Exterminieren! Exterminieren!

84
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:58,142
<i>There's a massive Dalek ship
at the centre of the planets.</i>

85
00:05:58,330 --> 00:05:59,901
They're calling it the Crucible.

86
00:06:00,745 --> 00:06:02,002
Guess that's our destination.

87
00:06:02,102 --> 00:06:04,741
You said these planets were like
an engine. But what for?

88
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:08,343
Rose, you've been in a parallel world,
that worl's running ahead of universe.

89
00:06:08,443 --> 00:06:10,223
You've seen the future. What was it?

90
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:12,319
It's the darkness.

91
00:06:13,341 --> 00:06:14,709
The stars were going out.

92
00:06:15,057 --> 00:06:18,894
One by one. We looked up
at the sky and they were just dying.

93
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,532
Basically, we've been
building this, um...

94
00:06:22,121 --> 00:06:26,839
this, travel machine, this,
er, Dimension Cannon, so I could...

95
00:06:28,279 --> 00:06:30,217
- Well, so I could...
- What?

96
00:06:30,933 --> 00:06:32,110
So I could come back.

97
00:06:33,262 --> 00:06:34,190
Shut up.

98
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:37,957
Anyway, suddenly,
it started to work

99
00:06:38,213 --> 00:06:40,017
and the dimensions started to collapse.

100
00:06:40,117 --> 00:06:41,209
<i>Not just in our world</i>

101
00:06:41,309 --> 00:06:44,188
not just in yours, but the whole
of reality. Even the Void was dead.

102
00:06:44,408 --> 00:06:46,415
<i>Something is destroying everything.</i>

103
00:06:46,515 --> 00:06:47,862
In that parallel world...

104
00:06:49,188 --> 00:06:50,466
You said something about me.

105
00:06:50,566 --> 00:06:53,332
The Dimension Cannon
could measure Time Lines.

106
00:06:54,148 --> 00:06:56,765
It's weird, Donna,
but they all seemed to converge on you.

107
00:06:57,048 --> 00:06:57,850
But why me?

108
00:06:59,148 --> 00:07:01,079
I mean, what have I ever done?

109
00:07:01,179 --> 00:07:03,456
I'm a temp. From Chiswick!

110
00:07:05,981 --> 00:07:08,881
The Dalek Crucible. All aboard!

111
00:07:25,170 --> 00:07:27,190
The Tardis is secured.

112
00:07:29,869 --> 00:07:33,755
Doctor, you will step forth or die.

113
00:07:35,248 --> 00:07:36,702
We'll have to go out.

114
00:07:37,468 --> 00:07:38,908
Cos if we don't, they'll get in.

115
00:07:39,248 --> 00:07:41,381
You told me nothing could
get through those doors.

116
00:07:41,757 --> 00:07:43,324
You've got Extrapolator shielding!

117
00:07:44,161 --> 00:07:46,537
Last time we fought the Daleks,
they were scavengers

118
00:07:46,637 --> 00:07:48,190
and hybrids... and mad,

119
00:07:48,450 --> 00:07:50,643
<i>but this is a fully-fledged
Dalek Empire,</i>

120
00:07:51,143 --> 00:07:52,647
at the height of its power,

121
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:55,377
experts at fighting Tardises,
they can do anything.

122
00:07:56,313 --> 00:07:58,696
<i>Right now, that wooden door...</i>

123
00:07:59,781 --> 00:08:00,643
is just wood.

124
00:08:01,664 --> 00:08:03,125
<i>What about your Dimension Jump?</i>

125
00:08:03,225 --> 00:08:05,636
<i>It needs another 20 minutes,
and anyway, I'm not leaving.</i>

126
00:08:05,842 --> 00:08:08,416
<i>- What about your Teleport?
- Went down with the power loss.</i>

127
00:08:08,516 --> 00:08:12,510
<i>Right, then, all of us together. Yeah.</i>

128
00:08:14,313 --> 00:08:15,008
Donna?

129
00:08:19,552 --> 00:08:21,390
- Donna?
- Yeah.

130
00:08:22,105 --> 00:08:23,910
I'm sorry.
There's nothing else we can do.

131
00:08:24,453 --> 00:08:25,470
Look, I know.

132
00:08:27,885 --> 00:08:31,964
Surrender, Doctor,
and face your Dalek masters.

133
00:08:32,304 --> 00:08:34,710
Crucible on maximum alert.

134
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,342
Daleks.

135
00:08:36,725 --> 00:08:37,952
Oh, God!

136
00:08:40,737 --> 00:08:42,415
It's been good, though, hasn't it?

137
00:08:43,035 --> 00:08:44,928
<i>All of us, all of it.</i>

138
00:08:45,602 --> 00:08:46,744
Everything we did.

139
00:08:48,812 --> 00:08:50,082
You were brilliant.

140
00:08:51,982 --> 00:08:53,202
And you were brilliant.

141
00:08:54,770 --> 00:08:56,174
And you were brilliant.

142
00:08:58,741 --> 00:08:59,670
Blimey!

143
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:14,853
<i>Daleks reign supreme.</i>

144
00:09:14,953 --> 00:09:17,648
<i>All hail the Daleks!</i>

145
00:09:17,748 --> 00:09:21,603
<i>Daleks reign supreme.
All hail the Daleks!</i>

146
00:09:21,703 --> 00:09:25,960
<i>Daleks reign supreme.
All hail the Daleks!</i>

147
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:28,035
<i>Daleks reign supreme.</i>

148
00:09:28,135 --> 00:09:31,922
- All hail the Daleks!
- Behold, Doctor!

149
00:09:32,347 --> 00:09:36,310
Behold the might
of the true Dalek race!

150
00:09:40,984 --> 00:09:42,076
Donna,

151
00:09:42,835 --> 00:09:44,338
you're no safer in there.

152
00:09:48,344 --> 00:09:49,224
Donna?

153
00:09:49,486 --> 00:09:52,216
Doctor? What have you done?

154
00:09:52,316 --> 00:09:56,281
- It wasn't me, I didn't do anything!
- Oi, oi, I'm not staying behind!

155
00:09:56,472 --> 00:10:00,230
- What did you do?!
- This is not of Dalek origin.

156
00:10:01,778 --> 00:10:02,508
Doctor!

157
00:10:02,608 --> 00:10:05,842
Stop it, she's my friend,
now open the door and let her out.

158
00:10:06,055 --> 00:10:08,535
This is Time Lord treachery.

159
00:10:08,635 --> 00:10:10,350
Please, the door just closed on its own!

160
00:10:10,450 --> 00:10:14,364
Nevertheless, the Tardis is a weapon.

161
00:10:14,547 --> 00:10:16,937
<i>And it will be destroyed.</i>

162
00:10:22,128 --> 00:10:24,858
What are you doing? Bring it back!

163
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:28,550
Doctor!

164
00:10:28,650 --> 00:10:30,560
What've you done, where's it going?!

165
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:34,975
The Crucible has a heart
of Z-Neutrino Energy.

166
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:39,553
The Tardis will be deposited
into the core.

167
00:10:39,752 --> 00:10:41,801
You can't,
you've taken the defences down,

168
00:10:42,638 --> 00:10:43,979
it'll be torn apart!

169
00:11:01,359 --> 00:11:03,634
- But Donna's still in there!
- Let her go!

170
00:11:06,256 --> 00:11:10,043
The female and the Tardis
will perish together.

171
00:11:10,347 --> 00:11:11,602
Observe!

172
00:11:13,416 --> 00:11:17,550
<i>The last child of Gallifrey
is powerless.</i>

173
00:11:22,649 --> 00:11:24,876
Please, I'm begging you,
I'll do anything!

174
00:11:26,308 --> 00:11:27,436
Put me in her place,

175
00:11:27,536 --> 00:11:30,436
you can do anything to me,
I don't care, just get her out of there!

176
00:12:01,617 --> 00:12:04,701
<i>You are connected to the Tardis.</i>

177
00:12:04,801 --> 00:12:07,270
Now feel it die!

178
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:39,510
- It's you.
- Oh, yes!

179
00:12:42,201 --> 00:12:44,590
- You're naked.
- Oh, yes!

180
00:12:45,930 --> 00:12:49,864
<i>Total Tardis destruction in ten rels,</i>

181
00:12:50,318 --> 00:12:53,271
<i>nine, eight, seven,</i>

182
00:12:53,824 --> 00:12:55,950
<i>six, five,</i>

183
00:12:56,102 --> 00:12:58,285
<i>four, three,</i>

184
00:12:58,385 --> 00:13:00,318
<i>two, one...</i>

185
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:03,270
The Tardis has been destroyed.

186
00:13:03,530 --> 00:13:05,956
Now tell me, Doctor.

187
00:13:06,509 --> 00:13:08,750
<i>What do you feel?</i>

188
00:13:09,410 --> 00:13:10,527
Anger?

189
00:13:11,257 --> 00:13:12,561
<i>Sorrow?</i>

190
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:14,569
<i>Despair?</i>

191
00:13:16,568 --> 00:13:17,221
Yeah.

192
00:13:17,753 --> 00:13:21,093
<i>Then if emotions are so important,</i>

193
00:13:21,256 --> 00:13:24,341
surely we have enhanced you?

194
00:13:24,441 --> 00:13:25,950
Yeah? Feel this!

195
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,870
Exterminate!

196
00:13:34,129 --> 00:13:34,937
Jack!

197
00:13:35,755 --> 00:13:37,914
Oh, my God! Oh, no!

198
00:13:38,127 --> 00:13:38,971
Rose,

199
00:13:39,950 --> 00:13:41,333
come here, leave him.

200
00:13:41,964 --> 00:13:45,163
- They killed him.
- I know. I'm sorry.

201
00:13:45,702 --> 00:13:47,653
Escort them to the Vault.

202
00:13:48,326 --> 00:13:49,560
There's nothing we can do.

203
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:53,376
They are the playthings of Davros now.

204
00:14:03,370 --> 00:14:04,695
All repaired. Lovely.

205
00:14:04,865 --> 00:14:07,802
Ssh! No-one knows we're here.
Gotta keep quiet.

206
00:14:07,975 --> 00:14:11,045
Silent running, like on submarines!
Don't drop a spanner.

207
00:14:11,145 --> 00:14:14,170
- I like blue. What d'you think?
- You are bonkers!

208
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:16,524
- What's wrong with blue?
- Is that what Time Lords do?

209
00:14:16,624 --> 00:14:18,602
Lop a bit off, grow another?
You're like worms!

210
00:14:18,702 --> 00:14:20,021
No, no, no. I'm unique.

211
00:14:20,191 --> 00:14:21,667
Never been another like me.

212
00:14:21,767 --> 00:14:23,750
Cos all regeneration
energy went into the hand.

213
00:14:23,850 --> 00:14:26,951
Look at my hand! I love that hand!
But then you touched it, wham!

214
00:14:28,667 --> 00:14:30,866
Instantaneous biological metacrisis.

215
00:14:31,192 --> 00:14:33,148
I grew... out of you.

216
00:14:33,695 --> 00:14:35,836
- Still, could be worse.
- Oi! Watch it, space man!

217
00:14:35,936 --> 00:14:39,744
Oi! Watch it, Earth girl!
Oh... I sound like you.

218
00:14:40,970 --> 00:14:43,914
I sound all sort of... rough.

219
00:14:44,014 --> 00:14:44,723
- Oi!
- Oi!

220
00:14:44,823 --> 00:14:46,350
- Oi!
- Spanners! Ssh!

221
00:14:47,425 --> 00:14:50,950
I must've picked up a bit of your voice,
that's all. Is it? Did I? No! Oh!

222
00:14:51,241 --> 00:14:53,910
You are kidding me, no way.

223
00:14:54,387 --> 00:14:57,150
One heart. I've got one heart!

224
00:14:57,678 --> 00:15:00,167
This body has got only one heart!

225
00:15:01,057 --> 00:15:01,910
What?

226
00:15:03,661 --> 00:15:06,022
- What, like you're human?
- Oh, that's disgusting.

227
00:15:06,122 --> 00:15:07,101
- Oi!
- Oi!

228
00:15:07,201 --> 00:15:09,670
- Stop it!
- No, wait, I'm...

229
00:15:10,921 --> 00:15:12,910
part Time Lord, part human.

230
00:15:15,201 --> 00:15:16,825
Well, isn't that wizard?

231
00:15:16,925 --> 00:15:20,173
I kept hearing that noise,
that heartbeat...

232
00:15:20,653 --> 00:15:22,000
That was me, my single heart.

233
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:24,964
Cos I'm a complicated event in time
and space, must have rippled back.

234
00:15:25,064 --> 00:15:28,110
- Converging on you.
- But why me?

235
00:15:28,370 --> 00:15:31,659
- Cos you're special.
- I keep telling you, I'm not!

236
00:15:32,142 --> 00:15:32,998
No, but you are.

237
00:15:35,091 --> 00:15:35,779
Oh.

238
00:15:37,764 --> 00:15:39,430
You really don't believe that,
do you?

239
00:15:41,369 --> 00:15:42,589
I can see, Donna.

240
00:15:43,454 --> 00:15:46,645
What you're thinking.
All that attitude. All that lip.

241
00:15:46,745 --> 00:15:50,392
Cos all this time...
you think you're not worth it.

242
00:15:50,492 --> 00:15:51,408
Stop it.

243
00:15:51,649 --> 00:15:53,712
Shouting at the world.
Cos no-one's listening.

244
00:15:53,812 --> 00:15:56,358
- Well, why should they?
- Doctor.

245
00:15:56,770 --> 00:15:58,630
- Stop it.
- But look at what you did.

246
00:15:59,845 --> 00:16:00,526
No,

247
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:03,264
No, it's more than that, it's like...

248
00:16:05,945 --> 00:16:07,484
..we were always heading for this.

249
00:16:09,317 --> 00:16:12,630
You came to the Tardis.
Then you found me again.

250
00:16:13,054 --> 00:16:14,670
<i>Your granddad! Your car.</i>

251
00:16:15,324 --> 00:16:17,671
Donna, your car, you parked your car

252
00:16:17,771 --> 00:16:20,554
right where the Tardis was going
to land, that's not coincidence!

253
00:16:20,654 --> 00:16:21,590
We've been blind.

254
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:23,905
<i>Something's been drawing us
together for a long time.</i>

255
00:16:24,005 --> 00:16:26,190
But you're talking like... destiny.

256
00:16:26,551 --> 00:16:30,196
- There's no such thing, is there?
- It's still not finished.

257
00:16:30,296 --> 00:16:31,167
It's like,

258
00:16:31,919 --> 00:16:33,195
the pattern's not complete,

259
00:16:33,635 --> 00:16:35,350
<i>the strands are still
drawing together.</i>

260
00:16:36,025 --> 00:16:37,607
But heading for what?

261
00:16:43,163 --> 00:16:44,362
<i>Hier ist niemand.</i>

262
00:16:44,716 --> 00:16:46,941
<i>Was immer Sie wollen,
gehen Sie fort.</i>

263
00:16:47,553 --> 00:16:48,879
Lassen Sie mich in Ruhe.

264
00:16:48,979 --> 00:16:51,758
Ich heisse Martha Jones.
Ich komme von UNIT.

265
00:16:51,858 --> 00:16:54,219
Agentin funf sechs sechs sieben eins,

266
00:16:54,319 --> 00:16:57,496
- von der medizinicshen Abteilung.
- Es hiess Sie kamen vorbei.

267
00:16:58,227 --> 00:17:01,361
That accent, that is London, ja?

268
00:17:01,837 --> 00:17:02,839
I went to London.

269
00:17:03,010 --> 00:17:03,860
<i>Long time ago.</i>

270
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,867
Thought this place
was supposed to be guarded.

271
00:17:05,967 --> 00:17:08,113
They were soldiers. Boys.

272
00:17:08,314 --> 00:17:10,165
<i>I brought them food, every day.</i>

273
00:17:10,265 --> 00:17:12,824
But when der Albtraum came
from the sky... they went home,

274
00:17:13,009 --> 00:17:13,896
<i>for die.</i>

275
00:17:14,589 --> 00:17:17,070
- But not you?
- I've got a job to do.

276
00:17:40,919 --> 00:17:43,629
London, in those days. To see it!

277
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:47,490
<i>So much glamour. I was so young.</i>

278
00:17:49,497 --> 00:17:51,202
I heard the soldiers talking.

279
00:17:51,748 --> 00:17:52,820
<i>Many times.</i>

280
00:17:53,501 --> 00:17:55,415
They would speak of the Osterhagen Key.

281
00:17:58,267 --> 00:18:00,456
I think London must be
changed now, yes?

282
00:18:00,985 --> 00:18:02,822
But still... the glamour.

283
00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:08,470
You will not go.

284
00:18:09,385 --> 00:18:10,830
I've got no choice.

285
00:18:11,371 --> 00:18:12,463
I know the Key.

286
00:18:13,563 --> 00:18:14,626
What it does.

287
00:18:16,258 --> 00:18:19,196
Sie sind der Albtraum.
Nicht die anderen, Sie!

288
00:18:21,245 --> 00:18:24,430
Ich sollte Sie umbringen,
am besten gleich jetzt!

289
00:18:25,898 --> 00:18:26,749
Then do it.

290
00:18:36,456 --> 00:18:37,150
<i>Martha...</i>

291
00:18:39,311 --> 00:18:41,091
Zur Hoelle mit Dir!

292
00:18:42,713 --> 00:18:43,656
I know.

293
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:47,983
Commence disposal. Incinerate!

294
00:18:54,044 --> 00:18:56,214
Disposal completed.

295
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:31,190
This is Osterhagen Station One.
My name is Martha Jones.

296
00:19:31,290 --> 00:19:32,985
Is there anyone there? Over.

297
00:19:35,808 --> 00:19:38,510
<i>Prisoners now on board the Crucible!</i>

298
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:41,053
<i>They will be taken for testing!</i>

299
00:19:41,429 --> 00:19:43,457
One step closer to the Doctor.

300
00:19:48,835 --> 00:19:51,097
Activate the Holding Cells.

301
00:19:54,636 --> 00:19:55,828
Excellent.

302
00:19:56,466 --> 00:20:00,566
Even when powerless,
a Time Lord is best contained.

303
00:20:00,779 --> 00:20:01,963
Still scared of me, then?

304
00:20:02,771 --> 00:20:05,062
It is time we talked, Doctor.

305
00:20:05,162 --> 00:20:06,974
After so very long.

306
00:20:07,074 --> 00:20:10,037
No, we're not doing the nostalgia tour,
I want to know what's happening,

307
00:20:10,137 --> 00:20:13,023
right here, right now,
cos the Supreme Dalek said Vault,

308
00:20:13,123 --> 00:20:13,750
yeah?

309
00:20:14,095 --> 00:20:16,110
As in dungeon, cellar?

310
00:20:16,894 --> 00:20:17,830
Prison?

311
00:20:18,090 --> 00:20:20,110
You're not in charge
of the Daleks, are you?

312
00:20:20,370 --> 00:20:23,269
They've got you locked away
down here in the basement like, what,

313
00:20:23,369 --> 00:20:25,573
a servant? A slave?

314
00:20:26,537 --> 00:20:28,786
- Court jester?
- We have...

315
00:20:29,906 --> 00:20:32,686
- an arrangement.
- No, no, no, no... no.

316
00:20:32,786 --> 00:20:34,012
I've got the word.

317
00:20:34,112 --> 00:20:35,586
You're the Dalek's pet!

318
00:20:35,891 --> 00:20:39,529
So very full of fire, is he not?

319
00:20:39,629 --> 00:20:43,302
<i>And to think you crossed
entire universes,</i>

320
00:20:43,402 --> 00:20:47,127
striding parallel to parallel,
to find him again.

321
00:20:47,227 --> 00:20:51,177
- Leave her alone.
- She is mine, to do as I please.

322
00:20:51,347 --> 00:20:52,630
Then why am I still alive?

323
00:20:52,805 --> 00:20:56,301
You must be here. It was foretold.

324
00:20:56,606 --> 00:20:59,032
Even the Supreme Dalek would not

325
00:20:59,132 --> 00:21:02,401
dare to contradict
the prophecies of Dalek Caan.

326
00:21:03,231 --> 00:21:05,750
So cold and dark,

327
00:21:06,203 --> 00:21:11,145
<i>fire is coming,
the endless flames.</i>

328
00:21:11,549 --> 00:21:12,814
What is that thing?

329
00:21:13,268 --> 00:21:14,501
You've met before.

330
00:21:15,197 --> 00:21:17,016
The last of the Cult of Skaro.

331
00:21:18,378 --> 00:21:21,135
But it flew into the Time War,
unprotected.

332
00:21:21,235 --> 00:21:26,245
Caan did more than that,
he saw Time.

333
00:21:26,599 --> 00:21:30,989
Its infinite complexity and majesty,
raging through his mind.

334
00:21:31,089 --> 00:21:33,621
And he saw you.

335
00:21:34,117 --> 00:21:35,230
Both of you.

336
00:21:35,330 --> 00:21:39,421
This I have foreseen,
in the wild, and the wind,

337
00:21:39,521 --> 00:21:42,920
the Doctor will be here, as witness.

338
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:45,197
<i>At the end of everything.</i>

339
00:21:45,297 --> 00:21:48,773
The Doctor and his
precious Children of Time.

340
00:21:51,362 --> 00:21:53,710
And one of them will die.

341
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:56,177
Was it you, Caan? Did you kill Donna?

342
00:21:56,277 --> 00:21:58,446
Why did the Tardis door close, tell me!

343
00:21:58,546 --> 00:22:01,854
Oh, that's it! The anger!

344
00:22:01,954 --> 00:22:08,195
The fire! The rage of a Time Lord
who butchered millions!

345
00:22:08,924 --> 00:22:10,601
<i>There he is!</i>

346
00:22:12,884 --> 00:22:14,070
Why so shy?

347
00:22:14,438 --> 00:22:15,785
<i>Show your companion.</i>

348
00:22:15,885 --> 00:22:18,310
<i>Show her your true self.</i>

349
00:22:19,211 --> 00:22:22,132
Dalek Caan has promised me that, too.

350
00:22:22,232 --> 00:22:25,690
I have seen. At the time of ending.

351
00:22:25,973 --> 00:22:29,671
The Doctor's soul will be revealed.

352
00:22:29,771 --> 00:22:33,176
- What does that mean?
- We will discover it together.

353
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:35,510
Our final journey.

354
00:22:36,147 --> 00:22:38,415
Because the ending approaches,

355
00:22:38,807 --> 00:22:40,983
the testing begins!

356
00:22:41,083 --> 00:22:42,350
Testing of what?

357
00:22:45,410 --> 00:22:46,830
The Reality Bomb.

358
00:22:50,201 --> 00:22:54,428
Prisoners will stand
in the designated area!

359
00:22:54,711 --> 00:22:56,930
Move! Move!

360
00:23:04,355 --> 00:23:06,299
<i>You will stand!</i>

361
00:23:06,909 --> 00:23:09,790
- I can't...
- You will stand!

362
00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:11,620
<i>I can't. Please!</i>

363
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:14,362
<i>On your feet. On your feet!</i>

364
00:23:14,690 --> 00:23:15,440
Mickey.

365
00:23:16,010 --> 00:23:16,990
<i>Mickey.</i>

366
00:23:17,497 --> 00:23:18,497
Jackie!

367
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:22,378
Prisoners will stand
in the designated area!

368
00:23:22,478 --> 00:23:25,316
- We can't just leave her!
- No, Mickey, wait!

369
00:23:28,930 --> 00:23:30,082
What does it mean?

370
00:23:30,182 --> 00:23:32,361
What are they testing,
what are they gonna do?

371
00:23:36,168 --> 00:23:37,983
I reckon it's that thing there.

372
00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:41,936
<i>Testing calibration of Reality Bomb!</i>

373
00:23:42,149 --> 00:23:45,645
Firing in ten rels, nine,

374
00:23:46,056 --> 00:23:48,007
eight, seven...

375
00:23:48,170 --> 00:23:52,833
Behold the apotheosis of my genius!

376
00:23:53,252 --> 00:23:56,209
<i>two, one, zero...</i>

377
00:23:56,443 --> 00:23:59,081
Activate planetary alignment field!

378
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:06,535
It's the planets. The 27 planets!

379
00:24:16,290 --> 00:24:18,133
But that's Z-Neutrino Energy...

380
00:24:18,459 --> 00:24:21,620
Flattened by the alignment of
the planets into a single string. No!

381
00:24:21,804 --> 00:24:22,470
Davros!

382
00:24:22,570 --> 00:24:23,889
<i>Davros, you can't!</i>

383
00:24:24,223 --> 00:24:25,590
YOU CAN'T! No!

384
00:24:25,850 --> 00:24:28,681
Single-string Z-Neutrinos
compressed into...

385
00:24:31,021 --> 00:24:31,750
No.

386
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:33,392
No way!

387
00:24:55,355 --> 00:24:58,085
30 minutes... it's recharged!

388
00:25:08,886 --> 00:25:10,321
I'm so sorry.

389
00:25:40,458 --> 00:25:42,224
Test completed.

390
00:25:42,819 --> 00:25:43,877
What was it?

391
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:46,381
Doctor?

392
00:25:47,537 --> 00:25:48,835
What did it do?

393
00:25:50,690 --> 00:25:55,041
- Doctor? What happened?
- Electrical energy, Miss Tyler.

394
00:25:55,459 --> 00:26:00,118
Every atom in existence
is bound by an electrical field.

395
00:26:00,218 --> 00:26:02,785
The Reality Bomb cancels it out.

396
00:26:03,019 --> 00:26:05,376
Structure falls apart.

397
00:26:05,610 --> 00:26:09,110
That test was focused on
the prisoners alone.

398
00:26:09,455 --> 00:26:16,230
Full transmission will
dissolve every form of matter.

399
00:26:16,770 --> 00:26:17,897
Stars are going out.

400
00:26:17,997 --> 00:26:19,430
<i>The 27 planets.</i>

401
00:26:19,690 --> 00:26:21,884
They become one vast transmitter.

402
00:26:22,628 --> 00:26:23,853
Blasting that wavelength...

403
00:26:23,953 --> 00:26:27,356
Across the entire universe.

404
00:26:27,789 --> 00:26:30,753
Never stopping, never faltering,
never fading.

405
00:26:30,890 --> 00:26:35,190
<i>People and planets and stars
will become dust,</i>

406
00:26:35,450 --> 00:26:40,230
and the dust will become atoms,
and the atoms will become... nothing.

407
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:42,820
And the wavelength will continue,

408
00:26:43,083 --> 00:26:47,119
breaking through the Rift
at the heart of the Medusa Cascade

409
00:26:47,219 --> 00:26:49,310
into every dimension,

410
00:26:49,410 --> 00:26:50,981
every parallel,

411
00:26:51,081 --> 00:26:55,435
every single corner of creation!

412
00:26:55,673 --> 00:26:59,944
This is my ultimate victory, Doctor!

413
00:27:00,433 --> 00:27:02,149
The destruction...

414
00:27:02,667 --> 00:27:05,632
of reality itself!

415
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:08,646
Prepare for universal detonation!

416
00:27:09,107 --> 00:27:11,575
The fleet will gather at the Crucible!

417
00:27:11,802 --> 00:27:16,036
<i>All Daleks will return
to shelter from the cataclysm!</i>

418
00:27:16,690 --> 00:27:21,270
<i>We will become the only
life forms in existence!</i>

419
00:27:21,607 --> 00:27:25,415
They're leaving!
Dad, the Daleks are going!

420
00:27:25,515 --> 00:27:26,870
Going where, though?

421
00:27:27,130 --> 00:27:29,110
And Donna's still out there.

422
00:27:29,536 --> 00:27:31,480
<i>It's not over yet, sweetheart.</i>

423
00:27:45,469 --> 00:27:46,550
<i>Just my luck.</i>

424
00:27:46,764 --> 00:27:48,788
I climb through two miles
of ventilation shafts,

425
00:27:48,888 --> 00:27:50,695
chasing life signs on this thing...

426
00:27:50,795 --> 00:27:53,277
And who do I find? Mickey Mouse.

427
00:27:53,377 --> 00:27:55,438
You can talk, Captain Cheesecake!

428
00:27:58,047 --> 00:28:00,670
Good to see you...
and that's beefcake.

429
00:28:00,999 --> 00:28:02,221
And that's enough hugging.

430
00:28:05,675 --> 00:28:07,256
We meet at last, Miss Smith.

431
00:28:07,504 --> 00:28:10,310
There is something we can do.
You've got to understand.

432
00:28:10,410 --> 00:28:11,957
I have a son down there on Earth.

433
00:28:12,057 --> 00:28:14,156
He's only 14 years old.

434
00:28:14,858 --> 00:28:16,085
I've brought this.

435
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:20,855
It was given to me
by a Verron Soothsayer. He said...

436
00:28:21,462 --> 00:28:23,749
"This is for the End of Days."

437
00:28:27,046 --> 00:28:28,082
Is that a Warp Star?

438
00:28:28,905 --> 00:28:30,600
Gonna tell me what a Warp Star is?

439
00:28:30,954 --> 00:28:33,649
A warpfold conjugation
trapped in a carbonised shell.

440
00:28:34,217 --> 00:28:35,536
<i>It's an explosion, Mickey.</i>

441
00:28:36,947 --> 00:28:38,950
An explosion waiting to happen.

442
00:28:39,210 --> 00:28:43,190
This is Osterhagen Station Five.
Are you receiving, Station One?

443
00:28:43,290 --> 00:28:46,129
I've got you. That makes three of us.
Three is all we need.

444
00:28:46,357 --> 00:28:48,676
My name is Anna Zhou, what's yours?

445
00:28:49,045 --> 00:28:51,847
Martha Jones. What about you,
Station Four? You never said.

446
00:28:52,322 --> 00:28:53,712
I don't want my name on this.

447
00:28:54,251 --> 00:28:56,010
<i>Given what we're about to do.</i>

448
00:28:57,201 --> 00:28:59,990
So what happens now? Do we do it?

449
00:29:00,556 --> 00:29:01,499
No. Not yet.

450
00:29:01,670 --> 00:29:04,606
UNIT instructions say, once
three Osterhagen Stations are online...

451
00:29:04,706 --> 00:29:07,449
I've got a higher authority,
way above UNIT.

452
00:29:08,081 --> 00:29:10,052
And there's one more
thing the Doctor would do.

453
00:29:10,534 --> 00:29:12,276
-What's this thing?
- It's our only hope,

454
00:29:12,376 --> 00:29:14,683
a Z-Neutrino biological
inversion catalyser.

455
00:29:14,783 --> 00:29:15,725
Earth girl, remember?

456
00:29:15,825 --> 00:29:19,510
Davros built those Daleks from himself.
His genetic code runs through the race.

457
00:29:19,610 --> 00:29:22,630
If I can use it to lock the Crucible's
transmission onto Davros...

458
00:29:22,730 --> 00:29:23,792
It destroys the Daleks!

459
00:29:23,892 --> 00:29:25,350
Biggest backfire in history!

460
00:29:25,610 --> 00:29:27,360
Incoming transmission!

461
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:29,154
Origin Planet Earth.

462
00:29:29,254 --> 00:29:30,949
Display!

463
00:29:31,914 --> 00:29:36,690
This is Martha Jones, representing
the UNIT, on behalf of the Human Race.

464
00:29:36,790 --> 00:29:41,649
Send transmission to the Vault.
Continue to monitor.

465
00:29:41,749 --> 00:29:45,097
This message is for the Dalek Crucible,
repeat, can you hear me?

466
00:29:45,197 --> 00:29:49,515
- Put me through.
- It begins. As Dalek Caan foretold.

467
00:29:49,615 --> 00:29:55,190
The Children of Time will gather.
And one of them will die.

468
00:29:55,513 --> 00:29:57,425
Stop saying that! Put me through!

469
00:29:57,765 --> 00:29:58,941
Doctor.

470
00:29:59,730 --> 00:30:01,367
I'm sorry. I had to...

471
00:30:01,467 --> 00:30:04,190
Oh, but the Doctor is powerless.

472
00:30:04,290 --> 00:30:06,958
My prisoner! State your intent.

473
00:30:07,290 --> 00:30:08,830
I've got the Osterhagen Key.

474
00:30:09,090 --> 00:30:12,430
<i>Leave this planet and its people
alone. Or I'll use it.</i>

475
00:30:12,690 --> 00:30:14,550
Osterhagen what?
What's an Osterhagen Key?!

476
00:30:14,881 --> 00:30:17,505
There's a chain of 25 nuclear warheads,

477
00:30:17,605 --> 00:30:20,626
placed in strategic points
beneath the Earth's crust.

478
00:30:21,129 --> 00:30:23,370
If I use the key... they detonate.

479
00:30:23,470 --> 00:30:25,322
And the Earth gets ripped apart.

480
00:30:25,422 --> 00:30:27,506
What?! Who invented that?!

481
00:30:27,606 --> 00:30:30,750
Well, someone called Osterhagen,
I suppose. Martha, are you insane?

482
00:30:31,145 --> 00:30:33,564
The Osterhagen Key is to be used...

483
00:30:33,947 --> 00:30:36,881
if the suffering
of the Human Race is so great,

484
00:30:37,222 --> 00:30:38,725
so without hope,

485
00:30:39,867 --> 00:30:41,860
that this becomes the final option.

486
00:30:42,335 --> 00:30:43,441
That's never an option!

487
00:30:43,541 --> 00:30:46,419
Don't argue with me, Doctor!
Cos it's more than that.

488
00:30:46,646 --> 00:30:48,870
Now, I reckon the Daleks
need these 27 planets

489
00:30:48,970 --> 00:30:51,474
for something,
but what if it becomes 26?

490
00:30:51,644 --> 00:30:55,110
What happens then? Daleks?
Would you risk it?

491
00:30:55,370 --> 00:30:56,700
She's good.

492
00:30:57,274 --> 00:31:00,550
- Who's that?
- My name's Rose. Rose Tyler.

493
00:31:01,118 --> 00:31:02,487
Oh, my God!

494
00:31:03,998 --> 00:31:05,027
He found you.

495
00:31:07,134 --> 00:31:09,470
Second transmission, internal!

496
00:31:09,730 --> 00:31:11,020
Display!

497
00:31:11,410 --> 00:31:14,878
Captain Jack Harkness,
calling all Dalek boys and girls,

498
00:31:14,978 --> 00:31:17,416
are you receiving me?

499
00:31:18,049 --> 00:31:20,790
<i>Don't send in your goons,
or I'll set this thing off!</i>

500
00:31:21,155 --> 00:31:22,262
He's still alive!

501
00:31:23,304 --> 00:31:25,243
Oh, my God, that's my mum!

502
00:31:25,343 --> 00:31:27,037
<i>And Mickey!
Captain, what are you doing?</i>

503
00:31:27,137 --> 00:31:30,591
I've got a Warp Star wired into
the mainframe. I break this shell,

504
00:31:31,090 --> 00:31:32,634
the entire Crucible goes up.

505
00:31:32,882 --> 00:31:34,880
You can't! Where did you
get a Warp Star?!

506
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:35,710
From me.

507
00:31:36,093 --> 00:31:38,510
We had no choice.
We saw what happened to the prisoners.

508
00:31:38,610 --> 00:31:42,270
Impossible. That face.

509
00:31:42,625 --> 00:31:45,199
<i>After all these years.</i>

510
00:31:45,491 --> 00:31:46,420
Davros?

511
00:31:48,069 --> 00:31:49,722
It's been quite a while.

512
00:31:50,246 --> 00:31:52,523
Sarah Jane Smith, remember?

513
00:31:52,623 --> 00:31:55,660
Oh, this is meant to be!

514
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:58,089
The Circle of Time is closing.

515
00:31:58,189 --> 00:32:03,389
You were there, on Skaro,
at the very beginning of my creation.

516
00:32:03,703 --> 00:32:05,361
And I've learnt how to fight since then.

517
00:32:05,461 --> 00:32:08,151
Let the Doctor go,
or this Warp Star gets opened.

518
00:32:08,251 --> 00:32:08,995
<i>I'll do it!</i>

519
00:32:09,364 --> 00:32:10,590
Don't imagine I wouldn't.

520
00:32:10,850 --> 00:32:12,493
Now that's what I call a ransom!

521
00:32:15,472 --> 00:32:16,230
Doctor?

522
00:32:16,490 --> 00:32:19,692
And the prophecy unfolds.

523
00:32:19,792 --> 00:32:22,578
<i>The Doctor's soul is revealed.</i>

524
00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:26,979
See him! See the heart of him!

525
00:32:28,187 --> 00:32:31,157
The man who abhors violence.

526
00:32:31,476 --> 00:32:33,057
Never carrying a gun.

527
00:32:33,596 --> 00:32:35,367
<i>But this is the truth, Doctor!</i>

528
00:32:35,735 --> 00:32:39,950
You take ordinary people
and you fashion THEM into weapons.

529
00:32:40,523 --> 00:32:45,624
<i>Behold your Children of Time,
transformed into murderers.</i>

530
00:32:45,810 --> 00:32:47,576
I made the Daleks, Doctor.

531
00:32:48,328 --> 00:32:50,285
- You made this.
- They're trying to help.

532
00:32:50,385 --> 00:32:56,510
Already, I have seen them sacrificed
today, for their beloved Doctor.

533
00:32:57,617 --> 00:33:01,175
The Earth woman, who fell,
opening the Subwave Network.

534
00:33:01,275 --> 00:33:03,070
- Who was that?
- Harriet Jones.

535
00:33:04,769 --> 00:33:06,630
She gave her life to get you here.

536
00:33:11,851 --> 00:33:13,694
How many more? Just think!

537
00:33:13,794 --> 00:33:17,276
How many have died? In your name?

538
00:33:43,277 --> 00:33:44,469
<i>The Doctor.</i>

539
00:33:44,674 --> 00:33:47,993
<i>The man who keeps running,
never looking back.</i>

540
00:33:48,093 --> 00:33:50,993
Because he dare not, out of shame.

541
00:33:51,210 --> 00:33:54,176
This is my final victory, Doctor.

542
00:33:54,701 --> 00:33:56,126
I have shown you...

543
00:33:56,736 --> 00:33:57,786
yourself.

544
00:34:01,129 --> 00:34:02,178
Enough.

545
00:34:02,632 --> 00:34:05,350
Engage defence zero-five.

546
00:34:05,450 --> 00:34:07,430
It's the Crucible or the Earth.

547
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:10,069
Transmat engaged!

548
00:34:15,842 --> 00:34:18,416
- I've got you.
-Don't move, all of you, stay still!

549
00:34:18,516 --> 00:34:21,887
Guard them!
On your knees, all of you!

550
00:34:22,156 --> 00:34:23,910
- Surrender!
- Do as he says.

551
00:34:30,517 --> 00:34:32,034
Mum. I told you not to.

552
00:34:32,134 --> 00:34:33,470
I couldn't leave you.

553
00:34:35,829 --> 00:34:38,381
The final prophecy is in place.

554
00:34:38,630 --> 00:34:43,321
The Doctor and his children,
all gathered as witnesses!

555
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:47,589
Supreme Dalek, the time has come.

556
00:34:48,271 --> 00:34:48,881
<i>Now...</i>

557
00:34:50,524 --> 00:34:53,659
Detonate the Reality Bomb!

558
00:35:02,401 --> 00:35:05,470
Activate planetary alignment field!

559
00:35:10,761 --> 00:35:15,713
Universal Reality
detonation in 200 rels.

560
00:35:16,050 --> 00:35:18,798
<i>You can't, Davros,
just listen to me!</i>

561
00:35:19,237 --> 00:35:20,167
Just stop!

562
00:35:28,366 --> 00:35:31,593
Nothing can stop the detonation.

563
00:35:32,004 --> 00:35:35,004
Nothing and no-one!

564
00:35:38,082 --> 00:35:41,082
Ready? Maximum power!

565
00:35:49,250 --> 00:35:49,950
But that's...

566
00:35:54,730 --> 00:35:56,230
Impossible!

567
00:36:04,249 --> 00:36:05,070
Brilliant!

568
00:36:14,410 --> 00:36:14,972
Don't!

569
00:36:25,650 --> 00:36:27,470
Activate Holding Cell.

570
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:29,688
<i>Doctor...</i>

571
00:36:32,922 --> 00:36:33,823
I've got it.

572
00:36:34,943 --> 00:36:36,309
But I don't know what to do!

573
00:36:39,241 --> 00:36:40,104
Donna!

574
00:36:42,714 --> 00:36:44,111
Donna! Are you all right, Donna?

575
00:36:44,475 --> 00:36:45,899
<i>Destroy the weapon.</i>

576
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:51,110
I was wrong about your warriors, Doctor.

577
00:36:51,821 --> 00:36:53,740
They are pathetic!

578
00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:55,885
How come there's two of you?

579
00:36:56,126 --> 00:36:57,889
Human biological metacrisis.

580
00:36:57,989 --> 00:37:00,357
Never mind. Now we've got no way
to stop the Reality Bomb!

581
00:37:00,457 --> 00:37:02,705
Detonation in 20 rels...

582
00:37:03,031 --> 00:37:04,152
Nineteen...

583
00:37:04,330 --> 00:37:06,315
Stand witness, Time Lord!

584
00:37:06,415 --> 00:37:08,524
Stand witness, humans!

585
00:37:08,624 --> 00:37:11,206
Your strategies have failed!

586
00:37:11,306 --> 00:37:13,639
Your weapons are useless!

587
00:37:13,739 --> 00:37:17,350
And, oh, the end
of the universe is come.

588
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:20,536
<i>Nine... eight... seven...</i>

589
00:37:21,316 --> 00:37:23,293
<i>six... five...</i>

590
00:37:23,827 --> 00:37:25,642
<i>four... three...</i>

591
00:37:26,138 --> 00:37:28,087
<i>two... one...</i>

592
00:37:34,794 --> 00:37:36,414
<i>Closing all Z-Neutrino relay loops</i>

593
00:37:36,514 --> 00:37:39,259
using an internalised synchronous
back-feed reversal loop.

594
00:37:40,386 --> 00:37:41,443
That button there!

595
00:37:42,131 --> 00:37:45,801
- System in shutdown!
- Detonation negative!

596
00:37:45,978 --> 00:37:48,416
Explain! Explain!

597
00:37:48,516 --> 00:37:50,324
EXPLAIN!!

598
00:37:50,424 --> 00:37:53,451
- Donna, you can't even change a plug!
- D'you wanna bet, Time Boy?

599
00:37:53,551 --> 00:37:55,324
You'll suffer for this!

600
00:37:58,834 --> 00:38:02,392
Oh, bio-electric dampening field
with a retrogressive arc inversion?

601
00:38:02,492 --> 00:38:04,264
Exterminate her!

602
00:38:04,364 --> 00:38:06,190
Exterminate!

603
00:38:06,290 --> 00:38:08,190
Exterminate!

604
00:38:08,718 --> 00:38:10,229
Exterminate!

605
00:38:16,726 --> 00:38:18,461
Weapons non-functional.

606
00:38:19,762 --> 00:38:21,541
Macrotransmission
of a K-filter wavelength

607
00:38:21,641 --> 00:38:24,407
blocking Dalek weaponry in self
replicating energy blindfold matrix?

608
00:38:24,507 --> 00:38:25,727
How d'you work that out?

609
00:38:25,827 --> 00:38:27,190
You... Time Lord!

610
00:38:27,805 --> 00:38:28,947
Part Time Lord!

611
00:38:29,130 --> 00:38:30,865
Part human! Oh, yes!

612
00:38:31,219 --> 00:38:33,092
That was a two-way
biological metacrisis.

613
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:38,630
- Half Doctor, half Donna.
- The DoctorDonna!

614
00:38:40,133 --> 00:38:42,707
Just like the Ood said, remember?
They saw it coming!

615
00:38:42,807 --> 00:38:44,275
The DoctorDonna!

616
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:46,707
<i>Holding Cells deactivated!</i>

617
00:38:47,466 --> 00:38:48,630
<i>Unseal the Vault.</i>

618
00:38:48,792 --> 00:38:53,550
Well, don't just stand there,
you skinny boys in suits! Get to work!

619
00:38:53,910 --> 00:38:57,477
Stop them!
Get them away from the controls.

620
00:38:57,577 --> 00:38:58,924
A-A-And spin.

621
00:39:00,052 --> 00:39:02,495
Help me, help me!

622
00:39:03,450 --> 00:39:05,001
<i>A-A-And the other way.</i>

623
00:39:08,697 --> 00:39:10,700
- What did you do?!
- Trip-stitch circuit-breaker

624
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:12,510
in psycho-kinetic
threshold manipulator!

625
00:39:12,610 --> 00:39:13,550
That's brilliant!

626
00:39:13,650 --> 00:39:17,043
- Why did we never think of that?
- Because you two were just Time Lords,

627
00:39:17,143 --> 00:39:18,149
you dumbos,

628
00:39:18,290 --> 00:39:19,790
lacking that little bit of human,

629
00:39:19,890 --> 00:39:22,262
that gut instinct
that comes with Planet Earth.

630
00:39:22,362 --> 00:39:24,850
Can think of ideas you wouldn't
dream of in a million years!

631
00:39:24,950 --> 00:39:27,342
The universe has been waiting for me!

632
00:39:27,442 --> 00:39:29,950
Now, let's send that
trip-stitch all over the ship!

633
00:39:31,715 --> 00:39:34,140
Did I ever tell you?
Best temp in Chiswick,

634
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:35,644
100 words per minute!

635
00:39:35,915 --> 00:39:36,555
Ha!

636
00:39:38,236 --> 00:39:42,392
- System... malfunction!
- Motor casing interference!

637
00:39:42,492 --> 00:39:44,740
What is happening?

638
00:39:45,002 --> 00:39:46,541
Explain!

639
00:39:49,970 --> 00:39:52,550
Come on then, boys,
we've got 27 planets to send home!

640
00:39:52,998 --> 00:39:54,140
Activate Magnetron!

641
00:39:54,544 --> 00:39:56,410
Stop this at once!

642
00:39:57,410 --> 00:39:58,254
Mickey!

643
00:39:59,527 --> 00:40:01,550
You will desist.

644
00:40:02,357 --> 00:40:03,775
Just stay where you are, mister.

645
00:40:05,194 --> 00:40:06,449
Out of the way!

646
00:40:09,578 --> 00:40:11,628
- Good to see you again!
- Oh, you too!

647
00:40:18,039 --> 00:40:19,071
Ready?

648
00:40:19,930 --> 00:40:21,230
And reverse!

649
00:40:26,823 --> 00:40:30,110
Off you go, Clom!
Back home, Adipose 3!

650
00:40:30,210 --> 00:40:34,443
Shallacatop, Pyrovillia
and the Lost Moon of Poosh, sorted!

651
00:40:34,769 --> 00:40:35,386
Ha!

652
00:40:36,287 --> 00:40:36,932
Ha!

653
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:38,822
<i>We need more power.</i>

654
00:40:39,311 --> 00:40:41,205
Is anyone gonna tell us what's going on?

655
00:40:41,305 --> 00:40:43,857
He poured his regeneration energy
into his spare hand,

656
00:40:44,028 --> 00:40:45,723
I touched the hand, he grew out of that.

657
00:40:45,823 --> 00:40:49,120
That fed back into me.
But it just stayed dormant in my head

658
00:40:49,220 --> 00:40:51,850
till the synapses got that extra spark,
kicking them into life.

659
00:40:51,950 --> 00:40:53,013
Thank you, Davros!

660
00:40:58,006 --> 00:41:00,148
Part human, part Time Lord.

661
00:41:01,453 --> 00:41:03,091
And I got the best bit
of the Doctor.

662
00:41:04,275 --> 00:41:05,609
I got his mind!

663
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:07,937
So there's three of you?
Three Doctors?

664
00:41:08,178 --> 00:41:10,129
I can't tell you
what I'm thinking right now.

665
00:41:10,434 --> 00:41:12,739
You're so unique the Time Lines
were converging on you.

666
00:41:12,966 --> 00:41:14,583
A human with a Time Lord brain!

667
00:41:14,683 --> 00:41:17,350
But you promised me, Dalek Caan!

668
00:41:17,999 --> 00:41:20,360
Why did you not foresee this?

669
00:41:23,382 --> 00:41:24,382
Oh, I think he did.

670
00:41:24,530 --> 00:41:27,234
Something's been manipulating
the Time Lines for ages.

671
00:41:27,616 --> 00:41:30,184
Getting Donna Noble to the
right place at the right time.

672
00:41:30,284 --> 00:41:32,674
This would always have happened.

673
00:41:32,774 --> 00:41:35,283
I only helped, Doctor.

674
00:41:35,730 --> 00:41:38,857
You betrayed the Daleks!

675
00:41:38,957 --> 00:41:41,390
I saw the Daleks.

676
00:41:41,673 --> 00:41:44,503
<i>What we have done,
throughout time and space,</i>

677
00:41:44,603 --> 00:41:50,670
I saw the truth of us,
Creator, and I decreed, "No more!"

678
00:41:50,870 --> 00:41:54,113
I will descend... to the Vault!

679
00:41:55,354 --> 00:41:56,219
Heads up!

680
00:41:56,319 --> 00:41:59,276
Davros! You have betrayed us!

681
00:41:59,376 --> 00:42:02,566
- It was Dalek Caan.
- The Vault will be purged!

682
00:42:02,666 --> 00:42:05,495
You will all be exterminated!

683
00:42:09,330 --> 00:42:11,487
Like I was saying. Feel this!

684
00:42:16,301 --> 00:42:19,180
We've lost the Magnetron!
And there's only one planet left!

685
00:42:20,287 --> 00:42:22,351
Guess which one?
But we can use the Tardis.

686
00:42:25,759 --> 00:42:28,837
Holding Earth stability.
Maintaining atmospheric shell.

687
00:42:28,937 --> 00:42:31,185
The prophecy must complete.

688
00:42:31,816 --> 00:42:33,107
Don't listen to him!

689
00:42:33,207 --> 00:42:36,655
I have seen the end
of everything, Dalek,

690
00:42:36,967 --> 00:42:40,045
and you must make it happen, Doctor.

691
00:42:40,236 --> 00:42:42,569
He's right. Cos with or without
a Reality Bomb,

692
00:42:42,669 --> 00:42:45,343
this Dalek Empire's
big enough to slaughter the cosmos.

693
00:42:46,797 --> 00:42:49,229
- They've got to be stopped.
- Just wait for the Doctor.

694
00:42:50,088 --> 00:42:51,310
I am the Doctor!

695
00:42:51,471 --> 00:42:55,005
Maximising Dalekenium power feeds!
Blasting them back!

696
00:43:12,889 --> 00:43:13,956
What have you done?

697
00:43:14,621 --> 00:43:15,961
Fulfilling the prophecy.

698
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:29,578
There goes the Time Lock!

699
00:43:35,241 --> 00:43:38,030
D'you know what you've done?
Now get in the Tardis!

700
00:43:40,265 --> 00:43:42,882
Everyone! All of you, inside!

701
00:43:42,982 --> 00:43:45,426
- Run! In! In! In! In!
- Sarah Jane! Rose!

702
00:43:45,667 --> 00:43:48,910
Jackie! Jack! Mickey!

703
00:43:56,481 --> 00:43:58,687
Davros! Come with me!

704
00:43:59,247 --> 00:44:00,715
<i>I promise I can save you.</i>

705
00:44:00,815 --> 00:44:04,110
Never forget, Doctor. You did this!

706
00:44:04,751 --> 00:44:07,599
I name you, forever...

707
00:44:07,854 --> 00:44:12,430
you are the Destroyer of the Worlds!

708
00:44:16,094 --> 00:44:19,187
One will still die.

709
00:44:23,215 --> 00:44:26,061
And... off we go.

710
00:44:37,650 --> 00:44:40,129
What about the Earth?
It's stuck in the wrong part of space!

711
00:44:40,229 --> 00:44:42,948
I'm on it! Torchwood, this is
the Doctor! Are you receiving me?

712
00:44:43,048 --> 00:44:45,052
Loud and clear! Is Jack there?

713
00:44:45,463 --> 00:44:47,726
Can't get rid of him!
Jack, what's her name?

714
00:44:47,826 --> 00:44:48,722
Gwen Cooper.

715
00:44:49,438 --> 00:44:52,488
Tell me, Gwen Cooper,
are you from an old Cardiff family?

716
00:44:53,268 --> 00:44:55,534
Yes, all the way back to the 1800s!

717
00:44:56,073 --> 00:44:59,803
Thought so, spatial genetic
multiplicity, funny old world.

718
00:44:59,903 --> 00:45:03,328
Torchwood, open that Rift Manipulator.
Send all the power to me.

719
00:45:03,428 --> 00:45:04,628
Doing it now, sir!

720
00:45:04,855 --> 00:45:05,628
What's that for?

721
00:45:05,728 --> 00:45:07,784
It's a tow-rope. Sarah,
what was your son's name?

722
00:45:07,884 --> 00:45:09,189
Luke, he's called Luke.

723
00:45:09,289 --> 00:45:10,621
The computer's called Mr Smith.

724
00:45:10,721 --> 00:45:12,692
Calling Luke and Mr Smith.
This is the Doctor.

725
00:45:12,792 --> 00:45:14,409
<i>Come on Luke, shake your leg.</i>

726
00:45:16,090 --> 00:45:17,889
- Is Mum there?
- Oh, she's fine and dandy.

727
00:45:17,989 --> 00:45:20,743
Mr Smith, harness the Rift Power
and loop it around the Tardis,

728
00:45:20,843 --> 00:45:21,658
you got that?

729
00:45:21,758 --> 00:45:25,679
<i>I regret, I will need remote access
to Tardis basecode numerals.</i>

730
00:45:25,864 --> 00:45:28,816
- Oh, blimey, that's gonna take a while.
- No, no, no, let me!

731
00:45:30,681 --> 00:45:33,733
- K9! Out you come!
- Affirmative, Mistress!

732
00:45:34,917 --> 00:45:36,270
<i>Oh, good dog!</i>

733
00:45:36,370 --> 00:45:38,925
- K9, give Mr Smith the basecode!
- Master!

734
00:45:39,137 --> 00:45:41,293
Tardis basecode now
being transferred.

735
00:45:42,730 --> 00:45:44,066
<i>The process is simple!</i>

736
00:45:44,570 --> 00:45:45,812
Now then, you lot...

737
00:45:46,337 --> 00:45:48,706
Sarah, hold that down.
Mickey, you hold that.

738
00:45:48,968 --> 00:45:51,220
<i>D'you know why this Tardis
always rattles about?</i>

739
00:45:51,320 --> 00:45:53,995
Rose, that, there.
It's designed to have six pilots.

740
00:45:54,095 --> 00:45:56,028
I do it single handed! Martha,
keep that level.

741
00:45:56,128 --> 00:45:58,527
But not any more!
Jack, there you go, steady that...

742
00:45:58,627 --> 00:46:00,051
Now we can fly this thing...

743
00:46:00,725 --> 00:46:04,041
No, Jackie, no, no, not you,
don't touch anything, just...

744
00:46:04,701 --> 00:46:06,907
stand back.
Like it's meant to be flown!

745
00:46:07,176 --> 00:46:10,070
We've got the Torchwood Rift
looped around the Tardis by Mr Smith,

746
00:46:10,439 --> 00:46:13,184
and we're gonna fly
Planet Earth back home!

747
00:46:15,088 --> 00:46:16,904
Right then! Off we go!

748
00:47:24,654 --> 00:47:27,051
That's really good, Jack.
I think you're the best.

749
00:48:40,798 --> 00:48:44,642
You know, you act
like such a lonely man.

750
00:48:44,983 --> 00:48:45,897
But look at you.

751
00:48:45,997 --> 00:48:48,190
You've got the biggest
family on Earth!

752
00:48:54,391 --> 00:48:56,387
Gotta go. He's only 14.

753
00:48:56,912 --> 00:48:59,877
It's a long story. And thank you!

754
00:49:06,059 --> 00:49:08,241
Yeah, I'm fine, are you all right?

755
00:49:09,222 --> 00:49:09,938
<i>Yeah, I know.</i>

756
00:49:10,754 --> 00:49:11,950
I'm gonna miss you.

757
00:49:12,569 --> 00:49:14,597
- More than anyone.
- What d'you mean?

758
00:49:14,697 --> 00:49:16,553
The Doctor's going
to take us home, isn't he?

759
00:49:17,163 --> 00:49:18,230
Well, that's the point.

760
00:49:22,490 --> 00:49:23,788
I told you.

761
00:49:24,284 --> 00:49:25,604
No teleport!

762
00:49:26,855 --> 00:49:30,195
And Martha,
get rid of that Osterhagen thing, eh?

763
00:49:30,915 --> 00:49:32,246
Save the world one more time.

764
00:49:32,486 --> 00:49:33,608
Consider it done.

765
00:49:40,280 --> 00:49:42,575
You know, I'm not sure
about UNIT these days.

766
00:49:43,109 --> 00:49:45,237
Maybe there's something else
you could be doing.

767
00:49:48,413 --> 00:49:49,952
Oi, where are you going?

768
00:49:50,243 --> 00:49:52,399
I'm not stupid.
I can work out what happens next.

769
00:49:53,073 --> 00:49:56,413
And hey, I had a good time in that
parallel world, but my gran passed away.

770
00:49:57,250 --> 00:50:00,082
Nice and peaceful. She spent
her last years living in a mansion!

771
00:50:00,642 --> 00:50:02,869
There's nothing there for me now,
certainly not Rose.

772
00:50:04,848 --> 00:50:05,790
What will you do?

773
00:50:06,905 --> 00:50:08,750
Anything! Brand new life!

774
00:50:09,010 --> 00:50:10,022
Just you watch.

775
00:50:12,210 --> 00:50:13,150
See you, boss.

776
00:50:13,654 --> 00:50:14,611
Hey, you two!

777
00:50:17,306 --> 00:50:18,852
I thought I'd got rid of you.

778
00:50:25,048 --> 00:50:26,679
Just time for one last trip.

779
00:50:29,956 --> 00:50:31,445
Darlig Ulv Stranden.

780
00:50:33,083 --> 00:50:34,594
Better known as...

781
00:50:37,398 --> 00:50:40,022
Bad Wolf Bay

782
00:50:49,971 --> 00:50:51,631
Fat lot of good this is!

783
00:50:51,822 --> 00:50:53,964
Back of beyond. Bloody Norway!

784
00:50:54,127 --> 00:50:57,311
I'm going to have to phone your father,
he's on the nursery run.

785
00:50:57,709 --> 00:51:01,141
I was pregnant, do you remember?
Had a baby boy.

786
00:51:01,241 --> 00:51:01,999
Ah, brilliant.

787
00:51:02,099 --> 00:51:03,750
- What did you call him?
- Doctor.

788
00:51:05,709 --> 00:51:07,531
- Really?
- No, you plum!

789
00:51:07,900 --> 00:51:09,110
He's called Tony.

790
00:51:09,210 --> 00:51:11,935
Hold on. This is
the parallel universe, right?

791
00:51:12,035 --> 00:51:13,162
You're back home.

792
00:51:13,262 --> 00:51:14,990
<i>The walls of the world
are closing again,</i>

793
00:51:15,090 --> 00:51:18,612
now the Reality Bomb never
happened. Dimensional retroclosure.

794
00:51:19,434 --> 00:51:21,164
See, I really get that stuff now.

795
00:51:21,604 --> 00:51:22,150
<i>No but...</i>

796
00:51:22,320 --> 00:51:25,378
I spent all that time trying to find
you. I'm not going back now.

797
00:51:25,968 --> 00:51:27,190
But you've got to.

798
00:51:27,755 --> 00:51:29,953
Cos we saved the universe,
but at a cost,

799
00:51:31,223 --> 00:51:32,280
and the cost is him.

800
00:51:33,720 --> 00:51:35,870
He destroyed the Daleks.
He committed genocide.

801
00:51:36,061 --> 00:51:37,791
<i>He's too dangerous
to be left on his own.</i>

802
00:51:37,891 --> 00:51:38,820
You made me.

803
00:51:38,920 --> 00:51:43,090
Exactly. You were born in battle.
Full of blood and anger and revenge.

804
00:51:45,392 --> 00:51:46,505
Remind you of someone?

805
00:51:49,548 --> 00:51:51,950
That's me, when we first met.

806
00:51:55,055 --> 00:51:56,430
And you made me better.

807
00:51:57,083 --> 00:51:59,565
- Now you can do the same for him.
- But he's not you.

808
00:51:59,743 --> 00:52:00,799
He needs you.

809
00:52:01,601 --> 00:52:02,707
That's very me.

810
00:52:04,245 --> 00:52:05,713
<i>But it's better than that, though.</i>

811
00:52:05,976 --> 00:52:07,898
Don't you see
what he's trying to give you?

812
00:52:08,515 --> 00:52:09,557
Tell her, go on.

813
00:52:13,302 --> 00:52:14,956
I look like him. I think like him.

814
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:17,249
<i>Same memories, same thoughts,
same everything,</i>

815
00:52:18,313 --> 00:52:20,894
- except I've only got one heart.
- Which means?

816
00:52:21,845 --> 00:52:22,985
I'm part human.

817
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:25,963
Specifically, the ageing part.

818
00:52:26,559 --> 00:52:31,790
I'll grow old and never regenerate.
I've only got one life, Rose Tyler.

819
00:52:34,901 --> 00:52:37,510
I could spend it with you...
if you want.

820
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:41,150
You'll grow old...
at the same time as me?

821
00:52:41,522 --> 00:52:42,415
Together.

822
00:52:56,470 --> 00:52:59,697
We've got to go,
this reality is sealing itself off...

823
00:53:00,520 --> 00:53:01,590
for ever.

824
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,059
But... it's still not right.

825
00:53:05,236 --> 00:53:08,715
Cos the Doctor's... still you.

826
00:53:08,815 --> 00:53:11,062
- And I'm him!
- All right.

827
00:53:12,098 --> 00:53:13,550
Both of you. Answer me this.

828
00:53:16,112 --> 00:53:19,178
When I last stood on this beach,
on the worst day of my life,

829
00:53:20,611 --> 00:53:22,284
what was the last thing you said to me?

830
00:53:24,263 --> 00:53:25,390
Go on, say it.

831
00:53:26,916 --> 00:53:28,584
I said, "Rose Tyler."

832
00:53:30,279 --> 00:53:32,563
Yeah, and how was
that sentence gonna end?

833
00:53:34,450 --> 00:53:35,670
Does it need saying?

834
00:53:38,921 --> 00:53:40,098
And you, Doctor?

835
00:53:42,531 --> 00:53:44,325
What was the end of that sentence?

836
00:54:31,723 --> 00:54:34,595
I thought we could try the planet
Felspoon! Just cos...

837
00:54:34,695 --> 00:54:36,011
<i>What a good name! Felspoon!</i>

838
00:54:36,111 --> 00:54:38,368
Apparently, it's got mountains
that sway in the breeze

839
00:54:38,532 --> 00:54:40,910
mountains that move, can you imagine?

840
00:54:41,564 --> 00:54:42,777
And how d'you know that?

841
00:54:43,018 --> 00:54:45,818
Because it's in your head.
And if it's in your head, it's in mine!

842
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:48,449
- And how does that feel?
- Brilliant!

843
00:54:48,549 --> 00:54:49,740
Fantastic! Molto bene!

844
00:54:49,840 --> 00:54:51,818
Great big universe,
packed into my brain!

845
00:54:52,123 --> 00:54:55,049
You could fix that chameleon circuit
if you hotbind the fragment-links

846
00:54:55,149 --> 00:55:00,430
and supersede the binary, binary,
binary, binary, binary, binary, ...

847
00:55:00,530 --> 00:55:02,350
binary, binary... I'm fine!

848
00:55:03,217 --> 00:55:05,160
Never mind Felspoon.
Know who I'd like to meet?

849
00:55:05,260 --> 00:55:07,903
Charlie Chaplin! shall we do that?

850
00:55:08,003 --> 00:55:10,058
Shall we go see Charlie Chaplin?
Charlie Chaplin?

851
00:55:10,158 --> 00:55:12,193
Charlie Chester?
Charlie Brown, no, he's fiction,

852
00:55:12,293 --> 00:55:14,769
friction, fixing, mixing,
Rickston, Brixton...

853
00:55:19,050 --> 00:55:19,844
Oh, my God!

854
00:55:21,341 --> 00:55:22,525
D'you know what's happening?

855
00:55:27,043 --> 00:55:27,741
Yeah.

856
00:55:28,380 --> 00:55:31,310
There's never been a Human/Time Lord
metacrisis before now.

857
00:55:33,170 --> 00:55:34,337
And you know why.

858
00:55:34,810 --> 00:55:36,571
Because there can't be.

859
00:55:40,081 --> 00:55:41,170
I want to stay.

860
00:55:42,028 --> 00:55:42,965
Look at me.

861
00:55:44,582 --> 00:55:45,979
<i>Donna. Look at me.</i>

862
00:55:51,309 --> 00:55:52,770
I was gonna be with you.

863
00:55:54,805 --> 00:55:55,656
Forever.

864
00:55:56,127 --> 00:55:56,879
I know.

865
00:55:59,071 --> 00:56:00,334
Rest of my life.

866
00:56:01,532 --> 00:56:02,695
Travelling.

867
00:56:03,291 --> 00:56:04,547
In the Tardis.

868
00:56:06,298 --> 00:56:07,590
The DoctorDonna.

869
00:56:12,121 --> 00:56:12,750
Oh!

870
00:56:14,090 --> 00:56:17,190
Oh, but I... I can't go back.

871
00:56:19,317 --> 00:56:20,650
Don't make me go back.

872
00:56:21,359 --> 00:56:25,070
Doctor, please,
please don't make me go back.

873
00:56:25,330 --> 00:56:26,246
Donna.

874
00:56:28,799 --> 00:56:31,306
Oh, Donna Noble. I am so sorry.

875
00:56:34,121 --> 00:56:36,108
But we had the best of times.

876
00:56:39,086 --> 00:56:40,047
The best.

877
00:56:45,615 --> 00:56:47,849
- Goodbye.
- No, no, no, please!

878
00:56:48,075 --> 00:56:49,969
Please, no, no!

879
00:56:57,250 --> 00:56:57,968
No!

880
00:57:07,948 --> 00:57:10,537
That must be her! Donna?

881
00:57:14,439 --> 00:57:16,841
- Help me.
- Donna?

882
00:57:18,829 --> 00:57:19,850
Donna?

883
00:57:29,387 --> 00:57:33,390
She took my mind into her own head.
But that's a Time Lord consciousness.

884
00:57:34,029 --> 00:57:35,738
All that knowledge,
it was killing her.

885
00:57:36,395 --> 00:57:37,710
But she'll get better now?

886
00:57:38,277 --> 00:57:40,030
I had to wipe her mind completely.

887
00:57:40,600 --> 00:57:42,628
<i>Every trace of me, or the Tardis,</i>

888
00:57:42,976 --> 00:57:46,351
anything we did together,
anywhere we went... had to go.

889
00:57:46,848 --> 00:57:48,750
All those wonderful things she did.

890
00:57:49,129 --> 00:57:49,916
I know.

891
00:57:51,399 --> 00:57:53,307
But that version of Donna is dead.

892
00:57:55,052 --> 00:57:57,988
Cos if she remembers,
just for a second, she'll burn up.

893
00:57:58,257 --> 00:57:59,667
You can never tell her.

894
00:58:01,561 --> 00:58:03,525
You can't mention me or any of it...

895
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:06,270
for the rest of her life.

896
00:58:06,837 --> 00:58:10,771
The whole world's talking about it,
we travelled across space.

897
00:58:11,635 --> 00:58:12,854
It'll just be a story.

898
00:58:15,720 --> 00:58:18,341
One of those Donna Noble stories
where she missed it all again.

899
00:58:18,589 --> 00:58:20,029
But she was better with you.

900
00:58:20,129 --> 00:58:22,110
- Don't say that.
- No, she was.

901
00:58:22,858 --> 00:58:25,497
I just want you to know
there are worlds out there,

902
00:58:26,564 --> 00:58:28,315
safe in the sky, because of her.

903
00:58:30,110 --> 00:58:32,230
<i>That there are people
living in the light,</i>

904
00:58:33,987 --> 00:58:35,966
and singing songs of Donna Noble,

905
00:58:37,253 --> 00:58:39,452
a thousand million light years away.

906
00:58:42,600 --> 00:58:44,171
They will never forget her...

907
00:58:46,526 --> 00:58:48,306
<i>while she can never remember.</i>

908
00:58:51,866 --> 00:58:53,230
And for one moment...

909
00:58:56,081 --> 00:58:57,911
one shining moment...

910
00:59:01,996 --> 00:59:04,990
she was the most important
woman in the whole wide universe.

911
00:59:05,516 --> 00:59:08,390
She still is. She's my daughter.

912
00:59:09,439 --> 00:59:11,643
Then maybe you should
tell her that once in a while.

913
00:59:11,964 --> 00:59:16,546
I was asleep! On my bed!
In my clothes! Like a flippin' kid!

914
00:59:16,646 --> 00:59:18,227
<i>What d'you let me do that for?</i>

915
00:59:19,326 --> 00:59:20,432
Don't mind me. Donna.

916
00:59:22,044 --> 00:59:22,917
John Smith.

917
00:59:23,321 --> 00:59:24,711
Mr Smith was just leaving.

918
00:59:24,811 --> 00:59:27,179
My phone's gone mad, 32 texts!
Veena's gone barmy,

919
00:59:27,279 --> 00:59:28,751
she's saying planets in the sky!

920
00:59:28,851 --> 00:59:31,230
What have I missed now?
Nice to meet you.

921
00:59:33,694 --> 00:59:36,630
As I said... I think you should go.

922
00:59:44,051 --> 00:59:46,278
How thick d'you think I am? Planets!

923
00:59:46,551 --> 00:59:48,175
Tell you what that was, dumbo?

924
00:59:48,275 --> 00:59:50,323
That was those two lagers
you get down the offy

925
00:59:50,423 --> 00:59:52,416
cos you fancy
that little man with the goatee!

926
00:59:53,438 --> 00:59:55,572
Yes, you do. I've seen you!

927
00:59:55,672 --> 00:59:57,357
Donna. I was just going.

928
00:59:57,867 --> 00:59:59,257
Yeah, see you.

929
00:59:59,410 --> 01:00:01,135
You're wasting your time with that one,

930
01:00:01,235 --> 01:00:04,094
because Susie Mair, she went on
that dating site, and she saw him...

931
01:00:04,194 --> 01:00:06,784
No, listen, this is important!

932
01:00:07,267 --> 01:00:09,721
Susie Mair wouldn't lie!

933
01:00:10,061 --> 01:00:12,150
Not unless it was about calories!

934
01:00:14,715 --> 01:00:15,438
Ah.

935
01:00:16,475 --> 01:00:17,971
You'll have quite a bit of this.

936
01:00:18,801 --> 01:00:20,227
Atmospheric disturbance.

937
01:00:20,950 --> 01:00:22,134
Still, it'll pass.

938
01:00:23,198 --> 01:00:24,368
Everything does.

939
01:00:28,108 --> 01:00:29,087
Bye then, Wilfred.

940
01:00:31,888 --> 01:00:32,824
Oh, Doctor.

941
01:00:34,384 --> 01:00:36,567
What about you now?
Who have you got?

942
01:00:38,035 --> 01:00:40,510
I mean, all those friends of yours...

943
01:00:41,205 --> 01:00:42,730
They've all got someone else.

944
01:00:44,476 --> 01:00:45,682
Still, that's fine.

945
01:00:47,192 --> 01:00:49,576
- I'm fine.
- I'll watch out for you, sir.

946
01:00:49,676 --> 01:00:51,190
You can't ever tell her.

947
01:00:51,290 --> 01:00:52,334
No, no, no.

948
01:00:53,849 --> 01:00:55,729
But every night, Doctor,

949
01:00:56,949 --> 01:00:58,098
<i>when it gets dark,</i>

950
01:00:59,211 --> 01:01:00,623
<i>and the stars come out,</i>

951
01:01:01,998 --> 01:01:03,162
I'll look up...

952
01:01:04,626 --> 01:01:05,782
on her behalf.

953
01:01:07,158 --> 01:01:08,661
<i>I'll look up at the sky...</i>

954
01:01:10,413 --> 01:01:11,597
and think of you.

955
01:01:13,200 --> 01:01:14,243
Thank you.

956
01:02:59,602 --> 01:03:01,801
