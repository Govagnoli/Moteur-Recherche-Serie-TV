1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,300
You are the weakest link.

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:08,900
This isn't just a game.
There's something else going on.

3
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:12,000
We have contestants outside
the games. The games continue.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,800
This is Satellite Five.

5
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:16,700
10, 000 channels,
all beaming down from here.

6
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:18,300
My masters fear the Doctor.

7
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:22,600
Tell me, who they are? !
You're dead, I saw you die!

8
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:26,200
That's impossible, they were
destroyed. Obviously they survived.

9
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:32,100
We have your associate. You will
obey or she will be exterminated.

10
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:33,600
- Rose?
- Yes, Doctor?

11
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:35,100
I'm coming to get you.

12
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:15,900
You know the Doctor.

13
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:19,600
You understand him.
You will predict his actions.

14
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:22,900
I don't know! Even if I did,
I wouldn't tell you.

15
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,200
Predict! Predict! Predict!

16
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,700
Tardis detected in flight.

17
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:31,300
Launch missiles! Exterminate!

18
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:34,200
You can't! The Tardis has
no defences, you'll kill him!

19
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:37,700
You have predicted correctly.

20
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:42,700
We got incoming!

21
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,600
The extrapolator's working, we've
got a fully-functional force field.
Try saying that when you're drunk.

22
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:58,400
And for my next trick. . .

23
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:23,300
Rose, get down!

24
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,900
Get down, Rose! Exterminate!

25
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:30,400
Aaaah!

26
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,200
You did it.

27
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:41,600
It feels like I haven't
seen you in years!

28
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:46,200
I told you I'd come and get you.
I never doubted it. I did.
You all right? Yeah, you?

29
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:51,200
Not bad, been better. Hey,
don't I get a hug? Oh, come here!
I was talking to him.

30
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:54,800
Welcome home. Oh. . .
I thought I'd never see you again.

31
00:02:54,800 --> 00:03:00,400
You were lucky, that was a one-shot
wonder. It drained the gun of its
power supply, now it's just junk.

32
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:05,400
Patience, my brethren. . .

33
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,800
You said they were extinct.

34
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:12,100
One minute they're
the greatest threat in the universe,
then they vanish.

35
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:14,900
They went off to fight a bigger war.

36
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
The Time War.

37
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I thought that was just a legend.
I was there,

38
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:24,600
the war between the Daleks
and the Time Lords,
with the whole of creation at stake.

39
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:27,700
My people were destroyed,
but took the Daleks with them.

40
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:30,800
I almost thought it was worth it,

41
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:33,800
and now it turns out
they died for nothing.

42
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:37,300
There's thousands of them now,
we could hardly stop one.

43
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:39,400
What are we gonna do?

44
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:41,800
No good stood round here
chin-wagging.

45
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,600
Human Race, you'd gossip all day.

46
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:49,600
The Daleks have got the answers,
let's go and meet the neighbours.
You can't go out there!

47
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:52,200
Exterminate! Exterminate!

48
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:58,100
Is that it?

49
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:01,600
Useless! Nul points!

50
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:06,100
It's all right, come on out, that
force field can hold back anything.
Almost anything.

51
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:10,200
Yes, but I wasn't going to tell them
that, thanks. Sorry.

52
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,100
Do you know what they call me
in the ancient legends
of the Dalek homeworld?

53
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:19,100
The Oncoming Storm.

54
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:23,600
You might have removed all your
emotions, but I reckon, right down

55
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:27,800
deep in your DNA,
there's one little spark left.

56
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:29,100
And that's fear.

57
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,500
Doesn't it just burn
when you face me?

58
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,900
So tell me. . .

59
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:40,100
how did you survive the Time War?

60
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:43,400
They survived through me.

61
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:59,300
Rose, Captain. . .

62
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,900
 .this is the Emperor of the Daleks.

63
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,500
You destroyed us, Doctor.

64
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:09,700
The Dalek race died in your inferno,

65
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:12,200
but my ship survived,

66
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:16,900
falling through time,
crippled but alive.

67
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:18,900
I get it. Do not interrupt!

68
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:22,300
Do not interrupt! Do not interrupt!

69
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:27,600
I think you're forgetting something.
I'm the Doctor, and if there's
one thing I can do, it's talk.

70
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:31,100
I've got five billion languages
and you've no way of stopping me,

71
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:33,400
so if anybody's gonna shut up,
it's you!

72
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:37,400
Okey-doke! So. . .where were we?

73
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:42,000
We waited here in the dark space,

74
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,700
damaged but rebuilding.

75
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:52,900
Centuries passed, and we quietly
infiltrated the systems of Earth,

76
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:56,300
harvesting the waste of humanity.

77
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:02,600
The prisoners, the refugees, the
dispossessed, they all came to us.

78
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:06,900
The bodies were filleted,
pulped, sifted.

79
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:10,100
The seed of the human race
is perverted.

80
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:14,400
Only one cell in a billion
was fit to be nurtured.

81
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:17,800
So you created an army
of Daleks out of the dead.

82
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:21,100
That makes them. . .half human.

83
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:22,600
Those words are blasphemy!

84
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,600
Do not blaspheme!

85
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:29,800
Do not blaspheme! Do not blaspheme!

86
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:33,700
Everything human has been purged.

87
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:39,200
I cultivated pure and blessed Dalek.

88
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:45,900
Since when did the Daleks
have a concept of blasphemy?

89
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:50,800
I reached into the dirt
and made new life.

90
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:54,500
I am the god of all Daleks!

91
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:56,200
Worship him!

92
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:58,600
Worship him! Worship him!

93
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:01,400
They're insane.

94
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:05,400
Hiding in silence for hundreds of
years is enough to drive anyone mad,

95
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,600
but it's worse than that.

96
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:11,900
Driven mad by your own flesh. . .

97
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:15,500
The stink of humanity.

98
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,300
You hate your own existence.

99
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:26,200
And that makes them
more deadly than ever.

100
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:32,300
We're going.
You may not leave my presence!

101
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:34,300
Stay where you are!

102
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:37,500
Exterminate! Exterminate!

103
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:39,400
Exterminate!

104
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:42,000
Exterminate! Exterminate!

105
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,500
Exterminate!

106
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:47,000
Worship him! Worship him!

107
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:48,500
Exterminate! Exterminate!

108
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:58,400
TARDIS WHIRRS

109
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:03,900
Turn everything up,
all transmitters, full power, wide
open, now! Do it! What does this do?

110
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:09,000
Stops Daleks transmatting on board.
Did you contact Earth? I tried to,
but they suspended our licence

111
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,200
cos we stopped the programmes.
Then the planet's defenceless.

112
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:16,100
Lynda, what are you
still doing on board?

113
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:18,100
I told you to evacuate everyone!

114
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:20,900
She wouldn't go.
I didn't wanna leave you.

115
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,500
There weren't enough shuttles anyway
or I wouldn't be here.

116
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,900
We've got 100 people stranded
on Floor Zero.

117
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:29,500
Listen, listen, my name's Rodrick.

118
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:34,200
I won the game, where's my money? Is
anyone listening? Where's my money?

119
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,000
Oh, my God, the Fleet is moving.

120
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,900
They're on their way.

121
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:45,700
Purify the Earth with fire.

122
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:51,200
The planet will become my temple
and we shall rise.

123
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:56,100
This will be our paradise.

124
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:06,800
Dalek plan, big mistake, cos what
have they left me with? Anyone?

125
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:11,600
Oh, come on, it's obvious! A
great big transmitter, this station!

126
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:14,500
If I can change the signal,
sequence it? Anyone?

127
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:17,700
You gotta be kidding. Give the man
a medal! A delta wave?

128
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:20,200
A delta wave! What's a delta wave?

129
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,800
Van Cassadyne energy,
it fries your brain.

130
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:25,800
Stand in its way
and your head gets barbecued!

131
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:31,000
And this place can transmit a
massive wave, wipe out the Daleks!
Get started and do it, then!

132
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:36,000
But a wave this size, building
this big, brain as clever as mine,
should take. . .three days?

133
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,400
How long till the fleet arrive?
22 minutes.

134
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:56,800
With our force field, they can't
blast us out of the sky, but that
doesn't stop the Daleks invading.

135
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:59,900
Do they know about the delta wave?
They'll have worked it out.

136
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:03,900
They wanna stop the Doctor,
so they've got to get to level 500.

137
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,100
I can concentrate the extrapolator
on the top six levels, 500 to 495,

138
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:13,200
so they'll penetrate the station
below that, at level 494,
and fight their way up.

139
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,900
Who are they fighting? Us.
And what are we fighting with?

140
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:20,500
The guards had guns with bastic
bullets, enough to blow a Dalek
wide open. There's five of us.

141
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:23,900
Rose, you can help me, I need
all these wires stripping bare.

142
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,500
Right, now there's four of us.

143
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:29,600
Then let's move it! Into the lift,
isolate the lift controls.

144
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:35,900
I-I just wanna say, um. . .thanks,

145
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
I suppose. And I'll do my best.

146
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,900
Me too.

147
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:55,200
It's been fun.

148
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,900
But I guess this is goodbye.

149
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:03,200
Don't talk like that, the Doctor's
gonna do it, you just watch him.

150
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:04,700
Rose. . .

151
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:09,400
You are worth fighting for.

152
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:16,700
I wish I'd never met you, Doctor.

153
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:19,300
I was much better off as a coward.

154
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:27,000
See you in hell.

155
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:31,000
He's gonna be all right.

156
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,000
Isn't he?

157
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:38,200
SHOUTING AND JEERING

158
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:46,300
One last time!

159
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:48,600
Any more volunteers?

160
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,200
There's an army
about to invade this station.

161
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:58,600
I need every last citizen
to mount a defence.

162
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:00,700
Don't listen to him!

163
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:04,600
There aren't any Daleks, they
disappeared thousands of years ago!

164
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,300
Thanks.

165
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:12,800
As for the rest of you, the Daleks
will enter the station at Floor 494,

166
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:16,600
and as far as I can tell,
they'll head up, not down.

167
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,500
But that's not a promise,

168
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:21,900
so here's a few words of advice.

169
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:23,800
Keep quiet.

170
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:28,100
And if you hear fighting up above,
if you hear us dying. . .

171
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:32,900
then tell me
that the Daleks aren't real.

172
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:39,700
Don't make a sound.

173
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,200
Let's go.

174
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,400
Suppose. . .

175
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,300
What?

176
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:04,700
Nothing.

177
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:07,700
You said, "Suppose. . ."
No, I was just thinking. . .

178
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:10,300
and I mean, obviously,
you can't but. . .

179
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:14,700
you've got a time machine. Why not
go back to last week and warn them?

180
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:19,500
As soon as the Tardis lands,
in that second, I become part
of events, stuck in the timeline.

181
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:22,700
Yeah, I thought it'd be
something like that.

182
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:27,200
There's another thing the Tardis
could do. It could take us away.

183
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,100
We could leave.

184
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:31,000
Let history take its course.

185
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,100
We go to Marbella in 1989.

186
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,900
Yeah, but you'd never do that.

187
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:36,500
No, but you could ask.

188
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:44,100
It never even occurred to you,
did it? Well. . .I'm just too good.

189
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:46,200
WHINING

190
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:50,500
The delta wave's started building.
How long does it need?

191
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,900
Is that bad?

192
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:02,500
OK, it's bad. How bad is it?

193
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:06,000
Rose Tyler, you're a genius!

194
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,900
We can do it! If I use the Tardis
to cross my own timeline. . .

195
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,500
Yes!

196
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:20,300
Hold that down and keep position.
What's it do?

197
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:25,800
Cancels the buffers. If I'm -
and I'm I'm brilliant - I might
just save the world or rip it apart.

198
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:30,600
I'd go for the first one.
Me too! I've just got to power up
the Game Station, hold on!

199
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:55,900
Doctor, what are you doing? !

200
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:58,200
Can I take my hand off? It's moving!

201
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,700
Doctor, let me out!

202
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:05,800
Let me out!

203
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:08,300
Doctor, let me out!

204
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:27,800
This is Emergency Programme One.

205
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:30,600
Rose, now listen, this is important.

206
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:34,100
If this message has activated,
then it can only mean one thing.

207
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:37,200
We must be in danger,
and I mean fatal.

208
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:40,800
I'm dead or about to die at any
second with no chance of escape.

209
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,000
No! And that's OK,
hope it's a good death.

210
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:47,200
But I promised to look after you,
so the Tardis is taking you home.

211
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:51,000
I won't let you! And I bet you're
fussing and moaning now, typical!

212
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:53,100
But hold on
and just listen a bit more.

213
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:55,100
The Tardis can never return for me.

214
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:59,900
Emergency Programme One means
I'm facing an enemy that should
never get this machine.

215
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,100
So this is what you do should do,

216
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:04,100
let the Tardis die.

217
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:06,300
Just let this old box gather dust.

218
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,900
No-one can open it,
no-one'll even notice it.

219
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,500
Let it become a strange little
thing standing on a street corner.

220
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:15,800
Over the years the world will
move on and the box will be buried.

221
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:18,700
And if you want to remember me,
then you can do one thing.

222
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:20,700
That's all, one thing.

223
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:25,600
Have a good life.

224
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:30,100
Do that for me, Rose.

225
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:32,600
Have a fantastic life.

226
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:41,400
You can't do this to me. You can't!

227
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:44,100
Take me back! Take me back!

228
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,700
No!

229
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:06,300
Come on, fly!

230
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:09,000
How do you fly? !

231
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,500
Come on, help me!

232
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:28,800
I knew it!

233
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:31,800
I was down Clifton Parade
and I heard the engines.

234
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:35,300
I thought, "There's only one thing
that makes a noise like that."

235
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,600
What is it?

236
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:47,200
Rose, I've called up
the internal laser codes,

237
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:52,900
there should be a different number
on every screen. Read them to me.
She's not here. Taking a leak?!

238
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:57,600
When she gets back, tell her to read
me the codes. She's not coming back.
Where'd she go?

239
00:17:57,700 --> 00:17:59,900
Just get on with your work.

240
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,200
You took her home, didn't you? Yeah.

241
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:06,400
The delta wave,
is it ever gonna be ready?

242
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:09,900
DALEK VOICE: Tell him the truth,
Doctor.

243
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:15,600
There is every possibility
the delta wave could be complete,

244
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:19,600
but no possibility of refining it.

245
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:24,700
The delta wave must kill
every living thing in its path,

246
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:27,800
with no distinction
between human and Dalek.

247
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:32,500
All things will die

248
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:35,300
by your hand.

249
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:39,900
Doctor, the range of this
transmitter covers the whole Earth.

250
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:45,500
You would destroy
Daleks and humans together.

251
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:48,300
If I am God,

252
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,800
the creator of all things,

253
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:54,800
then what does that
make you, Doctor?

254
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,600
There are colonies out there.

255
00:18:56,600 --> 00:19:01,700
The human race would survive in
some shape or form, but you're
the only Daleks in existence.

256
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:05,000
The whole universe is in danger
if I let you live.

257
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:07,600
Do you see, Jack?

258
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:12,900
That's the decision I've got
to make for every living thing.

259
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:14,900
Die as a human or live as a Dalek.

260
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,700
What would you do?

261
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:19,600
You sent her home.

262
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,000
She's safe.

263
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:25,200
Keep working.
But he will exterminate you!

264
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:27,800
Never doubted him, never will.

265
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:34,800
Now you tell me, God of all Daleks,
cos there's one thing I never
worked out, the words "Bad Wolf"

266
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:39,600
spread across time and space,
everywhere, drawing me in,
how did you manage that?

267
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:41,800
I did nothing.

268
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:44,700
Oh, come on, there's no
secrets now, your worship.

269
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:47,800
They are not part of my design.

270
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:53,000
This is the Truth of God.

271
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:05,200
And it's gone upmarket, this
place, they're doing little tubs of
coleslaw now. It's not very nice.

272
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,400
It tastes a bit sort of clinical.

273
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:10,400
Have you tried that new
pizza place on Minto Road?

274
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,600
What's it selling? Pizza.

275
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:15,100
That's nice. Do they deliver?

276
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:16,700
Yeah.

277
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,900
Oh, Rose, have something to eat.

278
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:25,200
200, 000 years in the future, he's
dying, and there's nothing I can do.

279
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:28,400
Well, like you said,
200, 000 years, it's way off.

280
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:34,600
But it's not, it's now.
That fight is happening right now,
and he's fighting for us,

281
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:38,200
for the whole planet, and I'm
just sitting here, eating chips!

282
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:44,800
Listen to me, God knows,
I've hated that man, but right now
I love him and do you know why?

283
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:49,500
Cos he did the right thing,
he sent you back to me.

284
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:51,900
But what do I do every day, Mum?

285
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:53,700
What do I do?

286
00:20:53,800 --> 00:21:00,500
Get up, catch the bus,
go to work, come back home,
eat chips and go to bed, is that it? !

287
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:02,500
That's what we do. Well, I can't!

288
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:05,500
Why? Cos you're better than us?
No, I didn't mean that!

289
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:10,900
But it was.

290
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:14,700
It was a better life.

291
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:19,300
And I don't mean
all the travelling and. . .

292
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:23,700
seeing aliens and spaceships
and things, that don't matter.

293
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:27,000
The Doctor showed me
a better way of living your life.

294
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:32,100
You know, he showed you, too.

295
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:35,800
That you don't just give up,
you don't just let things happen.

296
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:38,500
You. . .make a stand,

297
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:40,200
you say no!

298
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:45,500
You have the guts to do what's right
when everyone else just runs away,
and I just can't!

299
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:53,600
Right, Lynda, you are my eyes and
ears. When the Daleks get in, follow
them on that screen and tell me.

300
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:58,000
Yes. They'll detect you,
but the hydra combination door
should keep them out. Should?

301
00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:02,500
It's the best I can do.
How long till the fleet arrives?
'They've accelerated.'

302
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:11,200
This is it,
ladies and gentlemen, we are at war!

303
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:45,600
You can't spend the rest of your
life thinking about the Doctor.

304
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,400
But how do I forget him?

305
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:49,400
Start living your own life.

306
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:55,100
A proper life,
the kind he's never had, the sort of
life that you could have with me.

307
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:20,000
Over here. . . It's over here as well!

308
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,300
That's been there for years,
it's just a phrase, just words.

309
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:25,400
I thought it was a warning.

310
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:27,000
Maybe it's the opposite.

311
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:31,900
Maybe it's a message!
The same words written down now
and 200, 000 years in the future.

312
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:36,400
It's a link between me
and the Doctor, Bad Wolf
here, Bad Wolf there.

313
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:42,300
If it's a message, what's it saying?
It's saying I can get back! The
least I can do is help him escape!

314
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:48,100
Stand your ground, everyone,
follow my commands and good luck.

315
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:53,600
You were right,
they're forcing the airlock on 494.

316
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:03,300
CLANKING

317
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:15,700
All the Tardis needs to do is
make a return trip. Just. . .reverse.

318
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:21,000
But we still can't do it. The Doctor
said the Tardis is telepathic.
It's alive, it can listen.

319
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:23,600
It's not listening now, is it?
We need to get inside it.

320
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:27,000
Last time I saw you, with the
Slitheen, this middle bit opened,

321
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:32,100
and there was this light, and
the Doctor said it was the heart
of the Tardis. If we can open it,

322
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:34,700
I can make contact,
I can tell it what to do.

323
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:38,300
Rose,
if you go back, you're gonna die.

324
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:40,400
That's a risk I've gotta take,

325
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:43,600
cos there's nothing left for me here.

326
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:46,200
Nothing? No.

327
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:50,600
OK, if that's what you think. . .
let's get this thing open.

328
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:06,500
OK, activate internal lasers.

329
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:08,900
Slice 'em up!

330
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:12,300
Defences have gone off-line.
The Daleks have overridden them.

331
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:35,700
You lied to me!
The bullets don't work!

332
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:39,900
Aaargh!

333
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:54,900
Faster!

334
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,200
Come on!

335
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:04,700
It's not moving!

336
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:26,300
Advance guard have got to 495.
Jack, how are we doing?
495 should be good, I like 495.

337
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:31,400
Identify yourself!

338
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:33,300
You are the weakest link, goodbye!

339
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:37,900
Yes!

340
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,200
You are the weakest link!

341
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:44,900
Goodbye. . .

342
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:47,700
Proceed to next level.

343
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,400
They're flying up the ventilation
shafts. . .No, wait a minute.

344
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:57,200
God, why are they doing that?
They're going down!

345
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:07,300
Exterminate!

346
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:11,000
Exterminate! Exterminate!
Exterminate!

347
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:12,600
Exterminate!

348
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:14,500
Exterminate!

349
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:19,100
You can't! You don't exist

350
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:24,300
It's not fair! I won the game!
I should be rich!

351
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:27,300
I'm a winner,
you can't do this to me!

352
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:28,700
Exterminate!

353
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:32,300
FIRING AND SCREAMS

354
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:43,400
Floor Zero. . . They killed them all.

355
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:49,800
It was never gonna work, sweetheart,
and the Doctor knew that,

356
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:53,000
he just wanted you to be safe.
I can't give up.

357
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:56,000
Lock the door. Walk away.

358
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,500
Dad wouldn't give up.

359
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:59,400
Well, he's not here, is he?

360
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:02,600
And even if he was,
he'd say the same.

361
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:06,900
No, he wouldn't.
He'd tell me to try anything.

362
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:11,600
If I could save the Doctor's life,
try anything.

363
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:16,200
Well, we're never gonna know.
Well, I know. Cos I met him.

364
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:20,100
I met Dad.

365
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:21,700
Don't be ridiculous.

366
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:25,400
The Doctor took me back in time
and I met Dad.

367
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:28,500
Don't say that.
Remember when Dad died?

368
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:32,000
There was someone with him. . .

369
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,100
A girl, a blonde girl.

370
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:36,800
She held his hand.

371
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:44,600
You saw her from a distance, Mum,
you saw her!

372
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:46,100
Think about it!

373
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:48,500
That was me, you saw me!

374
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:53,300
Stop it. That's how good
the Doctor. . . Stop it! Just stop it!

375
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:12,800
Lynda, what's happening on Earth?
The fleet's descending.

376
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:15,800
They're bombing whole continents.

377
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:18,000
Europa. . .

378
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,100
Pacifica, the New American Alliance.

379
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:24,100
Australasia's just. . .

380
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:29,700
gone. This is perfection.

381
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:33,000
I have created heaven on Earth.

382
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:37,600
Floor 499, we're the last defence.

383
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:41,200
The bullets should work
if you aim for the Daleks' eyestalk.

384
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:46,200
I've got the force field at
maximum, so Dalek firepower
should be at its weakest.

385
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:48,000
I'm only here cos of you.

386
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:52,200
I joined the programme
cos you were on it.

387
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:56,100
Am I supposed to say,
"When this is all over,
we could go for a drink?"

388
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:59,300
That'd be nice. Yeah, well, tough.

389
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:09,500
There's gotta be
something else we can do.

390
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:11,500
Mum was right.

391
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:14,900
Maybe we should lock the door
and walk away. I'm not having that.

392
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:18,400
I'm not having you just. . .
give up now, no way.

393
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:21,600
We just need something
stronger than my car,

394
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:25,500
Something bigger,
something like that.

395
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:42,600
You've only got this until six,
so get on with it. Where the hell
did you get that?

396
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:47,500
Rodrigo, he owes me a favour,
never mind why, but you were right
about your dad, sweetheart.

397
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:51,600
He was full of mad ideas, and it's
exactly what he would have done.

398
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:55,300
Now get on with it
before I change my mind.

399
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:08,800
Open fire!

400
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:31,400
It's not working!

401
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:34,700
Concentrate your fire!
Eyestalk two o'clock!

402
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:46,100
Eye vision is impaired! I cannot see!

403
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:48,400
We did it!

404
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:50,900
Aaaah!

405
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:52,300
No!

406
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:54,400
NO!

407
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:55,800
Aaaah!

408
00:31:58,300 --> 00:31:59,900
I've got a problem.

409
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:06,000
Human female detected.

410
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:16,000
They've found me. You'll be OK,
Lynda, that side's reinforced
against meteors.

411
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
I hope so.

412
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,100
You know what they say
about Earth workmanship.

413
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:10,600
Aaaargh!

414
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:16,100
Last man standing!

415
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:20,400
For God's sake, Doctor,
finish that thing and kill them!

416
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:26,000
Finish that thing and kill mankind.

417
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:43,000
Keep going! Put your foot down!

418
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:50,000
Faster! Give it some more, Mickey!

419
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:51,300
Aaaah!

420
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:54,600
Keep going!

421
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:58,000
Come on, come on!

422
00:33:58,100 --> 00:34:01,000
Keep going! Give it some more!

423
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:17,000
Rose!

424
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:39,700
Doctor, you've got
20 seconds maximum!

425
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:17,300
Exterminate!

426
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:19,300
I kinda figured that.

427
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:26,200
It's ready!

428
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:42,700
You really wanna think about this.

429
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:46,900
Cos if I activate the signal,
every living creature dies.

430
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,500
I am immortal.

431
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:55,400
Do you wanna put that to the test?
I want to see you become like me.

432
00:35:55,400 --> 00:36:00,500
Hail the Doctor,
the Great Exterminator!

433
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:04,300
I'll do it!
Then prove yourself, Doctor!

434
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:07,900
What are you - coward or killer?

435
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:20,000
Coward.

436
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,700
Any day.

437
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:27,300
Mankind will be harvested
because of YOUR weakness.

438
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:29,700
And what about me?

439
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:31,700
Am I becoming one of your angels?

440
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:34,500
You are the Heathen.

441
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:38,800
You will be exterminated.

442
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:41,500
Maybe it's time.

443
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:47,900
TARDIS WHIRRS

444
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:53,500
Alert! Tardis materialising!

445
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:56,400
You will not escape!

446
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:09,800
What have you done? !

447
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:12,800
I looked into the Tardis,

448
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,900
and the Tardis looked into me.

449
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:16,900
You looked into the time vortex.

450
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,900
Rose, no-one's meant to see that.

451
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:22,000
This is the Abomination!

452
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:23,900
Exterminate!

453
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:32,000
I am the Bad Wolf.

454
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:34,100
I create myself.

455
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:39,000
I take the words. . .

456
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:44,000
I scatter them in time and space.

457
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,900
A message to lead myself here.

458
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:53,700
Rose, you've got to stop this,
you've got to stop this now!

459
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:59,500
You've got the entire vortex running
through your head, you'll burn!

460
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:02,000
I want you safe.

461
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:05,000
My Doctor. . .

462
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:08,100
protected from the false god.

463
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:12,800
You cannot hurt me! I am immortal!

464
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:15,800
You are tiny.

465
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:19,000
I can see the whole
of time and space,

466
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:23,300
every single atom of your existence,
and I divide them.

467
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:31,300
Everything must come to dust.

468
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:36,200
All things.

469
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:38,600
Everything dies.

470
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:47,200
The Time War ends.

471
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:49,900
I will not die!

472
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:55,700
I cannot di-i-i-ie!

473
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:13,300
Rose, you've done it, now stop.

474
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:19,800
Just let go.
How can I let go of this?

475
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:22,700
I bring life.

476
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:28,300
But this is wrong!
You can't control life and death!

477
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:29,800
But I can.

478
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:34,200
The sun and the moon,

479
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:36,000
the day and night.

480
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:39,100
But why do they hurt?

481
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:41,800
The power's gonna kill you,
and it's my fault!

482
00:39:41,900 --> 00:39:45,300
I can see everything. . .

483
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:48,500
All that is. . .

484
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:51,200
all that was. . .

485
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:53,800
all that ever could be.

486
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:59,000
That's what I see, all the time.

487
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,100
And doesn't it drive you mad?

488
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:03,500
My head. . .

489
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:04,700
Come here.

490
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:06,800
It's killing me.

491
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:09,100
I think you need a doctor.

492
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:30,100
ETHEREAL VOICES SING

493
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:36,300
TARDIS WHIRRS

494
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:54,400
What happened?

495
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:55,900
Don't you remember?

496
00:41:57,800 --> 00:42:02,100
It's like. . .there was this singing.

497
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:05,100
That's right, I sang a song
and the Daleks ran away!

498
00:42:05,100 --> 00:42:07,100
I was at home.

499
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:10,900
No, I wasn't,
I was in the Tardis and. . .

500
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:13,400
there was this light.

501
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:16,900
I can't remember anything else.

502
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:25,000
Rose Tyler!

503
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:28,800
I was gonna take you
to so many places, Barcelona.

504
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:33,700
Not the city Barcelona,
the planet Barcelona, you'd love it,
fantastic place!

505
00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:36,700
They've got dogs with no noses!

506
00:42:36,700 --> 00:42:40,700
Imagine how many times you'd tell
that joke and it's still funny!

507
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:46,700
Then why can't we go?
Maybe you will, and maybe I will,
but not like this.

508
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:48,500
You're not making sense.

509
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:52,700
I might never make sense again,
I might have two heads or no head!

510
00:42:52,700 --> 00:42:55,900
Imagine me with no head,
and don't say that's an improvement.

511
00:42:55,900 --> 00:43:01,200
But it's a bit dodgy,
this process. You never know
what you'll end up with!

512
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,900
Doctor! Stay away!

513
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:07,600
Tell me what's goin' on.

514
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:11,700
I absorbed all the energy
of the time vortex,
and no-one's meant to do that.

515
00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:17,700
Every cell in my body's dying.

516
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:22,200
Well, can't you do something?
Yeah, I'm doin' it now!

517
00:43:22,300 --> 00:43:28,000
Time Lords have this little trick.
it's, er. . .sort of a way
of cheating death.

518
00:43:29,700 --> 00:43:31,300
Except. . .

519
00:43:33,100 --> 00:43:35,400
 .it means I'm gonna change.

520
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:39,100
I'm not gonna see you again. . .

521
00:43:40,700 --> 00:43:44,200
 .not like this,
not with this daft old face.

522
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,100
And before I go. . . Don't say that!

523
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:50,300
Rose. . .

524
00:43:50,300 --> 00:43:54,600
before I go, I just wanna tell you,
you were fantastic.

525
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:59,100
Absolutely fantastic!

526
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:02,800
And do you know what?

527
00:44:05,900 --> 00:44:07,900
So was I!

528
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,300
Hello! OK. . .

529
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,800
New teeth, that's weird.
Where was I?

530
00:44:35,900 --> 00:44:39,900
Oh, that's right! Barcelona!
