1
00:00:07,951 --> 00:00:10,062
Ooh, smell that air!

2
00:00:11,057 --> 00:00:12,510
Grass and lemonade,

3
00:00:12,915 --> 00:00:16,480
and a little bit of mint,
a hint of mint, must be the 1920s.

4
00:00:17,034 --> 00:00:19,983
You can tell what year
it is just by smelling?

5
00:00:20,165 --> 00:00:21,067
0h, yeah!

6
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:25,000
Or maybe that big vintage car
coming up the drive gave it away.

7
00:00:32,260 --> 00:00:34,877
<i>The professor's luggage,
Richard, step lively.</i>

8
00:00:37,005 --> 00:00:38,685
Good afternoon, Professor Peach.

9
00:00:38,785 --> 00:00:40,164
Hello, Greeves old man.

10
00:00:40,997 --> 00:00:42,122
Ah... Reverend!

11
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:44,663
Professor Peach! Beautiful day.

12
00:00:44,763 --> 00:00:46,821
Lord's in his heaven,
all's right with the world.

13
00:00:46,921 --> 00:00:48,324
Reverend Golightly.

14
00:00:48,605 --> 00:00:52,204
Lady Eddison requests that you make
yourselves comfortable in your rooms.

15
00:00:52,304 --> 00:00:55,351
Cocktails will be served on the lawn
from half past four.

16
00:00:55,451 --> 00:00:59,094
You go on up. I need to check
something in the library. Alone.

17
00:00:59,194 --> 00:01:02,937
It's supposed to be a party. All
this work, it'll be the death of you!

18
00:01:03,442 --> 00:01:05,252
Never mind Planet Zog.

19
00:01:05,352 --> 00:01:08,562
A party in the 1920s,
that's more like it!

20
00:01:08,662 --> 00:01:11,292
Trouble is, we haven't been invited.

21
00:01:11,392 --> 00:01:13,626
0h, I forgot, yes, we have!

22
00:01:16,034 --> 00:01:17,382
I was right.

23
00:01:17,894 --> 00:01:21,695
Kept secret all these years...
It's unbelievable!

24
00:01:22,293 --> 00:01:24,680
But why didn't they ask...?
Heavens!

25
00:01:25,195 --> 00:01:26,378
Oh, it's you.

26
00:01:26,681 --> 00:01:28,823
I was just doing a little research...

27
00:01:29,464 --> 00:01:32,543
I say, what are you doing
with that lead piping?

28
00:01:34,014 --> 00:01:36,800
But that's impossible...
No! No-!

29
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:03,680

33
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:17,581
We'll be late for cocktails!

34
00:02:20,104 --> 00:02:22,760
What d'you think?
Flapper or slapper?

35
00:02:24,214 --> 00:02:25,560
Flapper. You look lovely!

36
00:02:35,775 --> 00:02:37,564
Look sharp, we have guests!

37
00:02:37,737 --> 00:02:38,760
Good afternoon!

38
00:02:39,248 --> 00:02:41,260
Drinks, sir? Ma'am?

39
00:02:41,527 --> 00:02:44,614
- Sidecar please.
- And a lime and soda, thank you.

40
00:02:44,794 --> 00:02:47,120
May I announce Lady Clemency Eddison!

41
00:02:47,448 --> 00:02:48,840
Lady Eddison!

42
00:02:49,374 --> 00:02:52,692
Forgive me,
but who exactly might you be,

43
00:02:52,792 --> 00:02:55,360
- and what are you doing here?
- I'm the Doctor,

44
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:58,778
and this is Miss Donna Noble,
of the Chiswick Nobles.

45
00:02:58,878 --> 00:03:02,311
Good afternoon, my lady.
Topping day, what? Spiffing!

46
00:03:02,498 --> 00:03:04,885
- Top hole!
- No, no, no, no. No.

47
00:03:04,985 --> 00:03:06,414
Don't do that, don't.

48
00:03:06,583 --> 00:03:08,827
We were thrilled to receive
your invitation, my lady.

49
00:03:08,927 --> 00:03:10,818
We met at the Ambassador's reception.

50
00:03:11,005 --> 00:03:12,535
Doctor, how could I forget you?

51
00:03:12,635 --> 00:03:15,877
But one must be sure
with the Unicorn on the loose.

52
00:03:15,977 --> 00:03:18,012
A unicorn? Brilliant! Where?

53
00:03:18,112 --> 00:03:20,697
The Unicorn. The jewel thief.

54
00:03:20,797 --> 00:03:22,666
Nobody knows who he is.

55
00:03:22,766 --> 00:03:24,411
He's just struck again,

56
00:03:24,591 --> 00:03:28,024
snatched Lady Babbington's
pearls right from under her nose.

57
00:03:28,124 --> 00:03:30,086
- Funny place to wear pearls.
- May I announce,

58
00:03:30,186 --> 00:03:33,952
he Colonel Hugh Curbishley,
the Honourable Roger Curbishley.

59
00:03:34,052 --> 00:03:37,309
My husband, and my son.

60
00:03:37,409 --> 00:03:38,932
Forgive me for not rising.

61
00:03:39,032 --> 00:03:42,422
Never been the same ever since
that flu epidemic back in '18.

62
00:03:42,631 --> 00:03:43,756
My word,

63
00:03:44,154 --> 00:03:45,654
you are a super lady.

64
00:03:45,813 --> 00:03:49,195
Oh, I like the cut of your jib.
Chin, chin.

65
00:03:49,295 --> 00:03:50,977
Hello, I'm the Doctor.
How do you do?

66
00:03:51,077 --> 00:03:51,943
Very well.

67
00:03:52,368 --> 00:03:54,972
- Your usual, sir?
- Ah, thank you, Davenport.

68
00:03:55,174 --> 00:03:56,119
Just how l like it.

69
00:03:56,219 --> 00:03:59,678
How come she's an Eddison but her
husband and son are Curbishleys?

70
00:03:59,778 --> 00:04:02,320
The Eddison title ascends through her.

71
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:04,361
One day Roger will be a lord.

72
00:04:04,461 --> 00:04:05,781
..Miss Robina Redmond!

73
00:04:05,983 --> 00:04:10,721
She's the absolute hit of the
social scene. A must! Miss Redmond!

74
00:04:10,821 --> 00:04:13,400
Spiffing to meet you at last, my lady!

75
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:15,993
Reverend Arnold Golightly!

76
00:04:16,317 --> 00:04:19,280
Ah, Reverend, how are you?

77
00:04:19,807 --> 00:04:22,721
I heard about the church
last Thursday night,

78
00:04:22,821 --> 00:04:24,264
those ruffians breaking in.

79
00:04:24,364 --> 00:04:25,722
You apprehended them.

80
00:04:25,822 --> 00:04:29,320
As the Christian Fathers taught me,
we must forgive them their trespasses,

81
00:04:29,813 --> 00:04:30,909
quite literally.

82
00:04:31,009 --> 00:04:33,376
Some of these young boys
deserve a decent thrashing.

83
00:04:33,614 --> 00:04:35,114
Couldn't agree more, sir.

84
00:04:36,053 --> 00:04:36,846
Typical.

85
00:04:37,041 --> 00:04:38,952
All the decent men are on the other bus.

86
00:04:39,052 --> 00:04:39,825
Or Time Lords.

87
00:04:39,925 --> 00:04:42,422
What about this special
guest you promised us?

88
00:04:42,522 --> 00:04:43,720
Here she is!

89
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:46,840
A lady who needs no introduction.

90
00:04:47,845 --> 00:04:49,200
Oh, no, please don't.

91
00:04:49,994 --> 00:04:53,040
Thank you, Lady Eddison.
Honestly, there's no need.

92
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:55,280
- Agatha Christie.
- What about her?

93
00:04:55,866 --> 00:04:57,920
- That's me.
- No!

94
00:04:58,765 --> 00:05:00,431
You're kidding!

95
00:05:00,531 --> 00:05:01,505
Agatha Christie!

96
00:05:01,605 --> 00:05:04,210
I was just talking about.
I said, I bet she's brilliant!

97
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:06,178
I'm the Doctor, this is Donna. Oh!

98
00:05:06,339 --> 00:05:08,279
I love your stuff! What a mind!

99
00:05:08,379 --> 00:05:11,880
You fool me every time, well,
almost every time, well,

100
00:05:12,054 --> 00:05:15,996
once or twice, well, once.
But it was a good once!

101
00:05:16,096 --> 00:05:17,640
You make a rather unusual couple.

102
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:19,295
- We're not married!
- Not a couple!

103
00:05:19,395 --> 00:05:21,200
Obviously not. No wedding ring.

104
00:05:21,999 --> 00:05:24,487
Oh, you don't miss a trick.

105
00:05:24,587 --> 00:05:26,148
I'd stay that way,
if I were you.

106
00:05:26,248 --> 00:05:29,362
The thrill is in the chase,
never in the capture.

107
00:05:29,462 --> 00:05:32,270
Mrs Christie!
I'm so glad you could come,

108
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:37,090
I'm one of your greatest followers.
I've read all six of your books!

109
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:40,313
Is Mr Christie not joining us?

110
00:05:40,413 --> 00:05:41,597
Is he needed?

111
00:05:42,268 --> 00:05:44,295
Can't a woman make
her own way in the world?

112
00:05:44,395 --> 00:05:45,989
Don't give my wife ideas!

113
00:05:46,089 --> 00:05:47,705
Now, Mrs Christie, I've a question.

114
00:05:47,893 --> 00:05:49,919
Why a Belgian detective?

115
00:05:50,237 --> 00:05:52,271
Belgians make such lovely buns!

116
00:05:55,982 --> 00:05:59,205
I say, where on earth's Professor Peach?
He'd love to meet Mrs Christie.

117
00:05:59,305 --> 00:06:01,044
Said he was going to the library.

118
00:06:02,695 --> 00:06:05,796
Miss Chandrakala. Would you go
and collect the Professor?

119
00:06:05,896 --> 00:06:07,535
- At once, my lady.
- The date,

120
00:06:07,635 --> 00:06:09,120
on this newspaper.

121
00:06:10,073 --> 00:06:11,234
What about it?

122
00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:14,517
It's the day Agatha Christie
disappeared.

123
00:06:18,498 --> 00:06:20,020
Professor Peach?

124
00:06:24,365 --> 00:06:25,411
Professor?

125
00:06:28,685 --> 00:06:31,840
She'd just discovered her husband
was having an affair.

126
00:06:32,274 --> 00:06:34,733
You'd never think to look at her.
Smiling away.

127
00:06:34,833 --> 00:06:37,129
Well, she's British and moneyed.

128
00:06:37,309 --> 00:06:39,800
That's what they do, they carry on.

129
00:06:40,735 --> 00:06:42,653
Except for this one time.

130
00:06:42,753 --> 00:06:45,537
No-one knows exactly what happened,
she just vanished.

131
00:06:49,708 --> 00:06:52,816
<i>Her car will be found tomorrow morning
by the side of a lake.</i>

132
00:06:52,916 --> 00:06:56,240
Ten days later, Agatha Christie
turns up in a hotel in Harrogate.

133
00:06:58,339 --> 00:07:00,178
Said she'd lost her memory.

134
00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:03,763
She never spoke about the
disappearance, till the day she died.

135
00:07:03,863 --> 00:07:05,689
But whatever it was...

136
00:07:05,789 --> 00:07:07,040
It's about to happen.

137
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:09,080
Right here, right now.

138
00:07:09,272 --> 00:07:13,040
Professor... The library!
Murder! Murder!

139
00:07:17,678 --> 00:07:18,962
Oh, my goodness!

140
00:07:19,885 --> 00:07:22,272
Bashed on the head.
A blunt instrument.

141
00:07:22,957 --> 00:07:26,108
Watch broke as he fell,
time of death was a quarter past four.

142
00:07:26,284 --> 00:07:27,546
Bit of pipe.

143
00:07:28,476 --> 00:07:31,640
Call me Hercule Poirot,
but I reckon that's blunt enough.

144
00:07:36,383 --> 00:07:38,680
Nothing worth killing
for in that lot. Dry as dust.

145
00:07:39,895 --> 00:07:42,477
Hold on. The body in the library?

146
00:07:42,686 --> 00:07:46,840
I mean, Professor Peach,
in the library, with the lead piping?

147
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:48,341
- Let me see.
- Out of my way!

148
00:07:48,441 --> 00:07:51,000
- Gerald!
- Saints preserve us!

149
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:52,960
- Someone should call the police.
- No need.

150
00:07:53,287 --> 00:07:55,540
Chief Inspector Smith,
known as 'the Doctor'.

151
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:57,852
Miss Noble's the plucky
young girl who helps me out.

152
00:07:57,952 --> 00:07:58,624
I say!

153
00:07:58,724 --> 00:08:01,800
Go into the sitting room.
I will question each of you in turn.

154
00:08:02,145 --> 00:08:05,680
Come along. Do as the Doctor says,
leave the room undisturbed.

155
00:08:06,277 --> 00:08:08,491
'The plucky young girl
who helps me out?'

156
00:08:08,591 --> 00:08:10,519
No policewomen in 1926.

157
00:08:10,619 --> 00:08:13,274
I'll pluck you in a minute.
Why don't we phone the real police?

158
00:08:13,374 --> 00:08:16,353
Well, the last thing we want
is PC Plod sticking his nose in.

159
00:08:16,650 --> 00:08:20,520
Especially now I've found this.

160
00:08:21,496 --> 00:08:23,392
- Morphic residue.
- Morphic?

161
00:08:23,492 --> 00:08:25,004
Doesn't sound very 1926.

162
00:08:25,104 --> 00:08:28,336
Gets left behind when certain
species genetically re-encode.

163
00:08:29,223 --> 00:08:30,557
The murderer's an alien?

164
00:08:30,657 --> 00:08:32,989
Which means one of that lot
is an alien in human form.

165
00:08:33,089 --> 00:08:34,587
Yeah, but think about it.

166
00:08:34,687 --> 00:08:37,941
There's a murder, a mystery,
and Agatha Christie.

167
00:08:38,417 --> 00:08:39,960
So? Happens to me all the time.

168
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:43,396
No, but isn't that a bit weird?

169
00:08:43,598 --> 00:08:47,831
Agatha Christie didn't walk around
surrounded by murders. Not really.

170
00:08:47,995 --> 00:08:51,732
I mean, that's like meeting Charles
Dickens and he's surrounded by ghosts,

171
00:08:51,832 --> 00:08:53,173
at Christmas.

172
00:08:54,147 --> 00:08:55,683
- Well...
- Oh, come on!

173
00:08:55,783 --> 00:08:58,490
It's not like we could drive
across country and find Enid Blyton

174
00:08:58,590 --> 00:08:59,859
having tea with Noddy.

175
00:09:00,321 --> 00:09:01,337
Could we?

176
00:09:01,437 --> 00:09:03,156
Noddy's not real, is he?

177
00:09:03,256 --> 00:09:06,760
- Tell me there's no Noddy.
- There's no Noddy.

178
00:09:07,496 --> 00:09:10,677
Next thing, you'll be telling me
it's like Murder on The Orient Express,

179
00:09:10,777 --> 00:09:13,775
- and they all did it!
- Murder on the Orient Express?

180
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:15,808
Oh, yeah, one of your best!

181
00:09:15,996 --> 00:09:19,090
- But not yet.
- Marvellous idea though.

182
00:09:19,268 --> 00:09:23,080
Yeah, tell you what,
copyright Donna Noble, OK?

183
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:26,055
Anyway! Agatha and I
will question the suspects,

184
00:09:26,155 --> 00:09:28,903
Donna, you search the bedrooms.
Look for clues, any more residue.

185
00:09:29,003 --> 00:09:31,680
- You'll need this.
- Is that for real?

186
00:09:32,059 --> 00:09:34,360
Go on, you're ever so plucky.

187
00:09:36,134 --> 00:09:39,408
Right then! Solving a murder mystery
with Agatha Christie, brilliant!

188
00:09:39,725 --> 00:09:42,689
How like a man to have fun,
while there's disaster all around him.

189
00:09:42,789 --> 00:09:45,610
- Sorry, yeah.
- I'll work with you, gladly.

190
00:09:45,794 --> 00:09:49,248
But for the sake of justice.
Not your own amusement.

191
00:09:54,247 --> 00:09:56,078
Now then, Reverend.

192
00:09:57,232 --> 00:09:59,251
Where were you at a quarter past four?

193
00:09:59,489 --> 00:10:00,578
Let me think.

194
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:03,897
Why yes, I remember.

195
00:10:04,971 --> 00:10:07,344
I was unpacking in my room.

196
00:10:07,444 --> 00:10:08,519
No alibi then.

197
00:10:08,988 --> 00:10:10,135
You were alone?

198
00:10:10,916 --> 00:10:13,916
With the Lord one is never truly alone.

199
00:10:14,075 --> 00:10:15,885
- Doctor.
- And where were you?

200
00:10:16,087 --> 00:10:17,796
Let me think... I was...

201
00:10:17,896 --> 00:10:20,005
Oh, yes, I was taking
a constitutional,

202
00:10:20,105 --> 00:10:21,986
in the fields behind the house.

203
00:10:24,286 --> 00:10:26,680
<i>Just taking a stroll, that's all.</i>

204
00:10:27,697 --> 00:10:28,512
<i>Alone?</i>

205
00:10:28,765 --> 00:10:29,919
<i>Oh, yes, all alone.</i>

206
00:10:30,019 --> 00:10:32,039
<i>Totally alone! Absolutely alone.</i>

207
00:10:32,287 --> 00:10:36,311
<i>Completely, all of the time, I wandered
lonely as the proverbial cloud,</i>

208
00:10:36,693 --> 00:10:38,994
<i>there was no-one else
with me not at all.</i>

209
00:10:40,018 --> 00:10:40,840
Not ever!

210
00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:44,040
- And where were you?
- At a quarter past four?

211
00:10:44,681 --> 00:10:48,071
Well, I went to the toilet
when I arrived, and then erm...

212
00:10:50,884 --> 00:10:52,560
<i>Oh, yes, I remember.</i>

213
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:54,764
<i>I was preparing myself,</i>

214
00:10:54,995 --> 00:10:57,339
<i>positively buzzing with
excitement about the party...</i>

215
00:10:57,439 --> 00:10:59,315
and the super fun
of meeting Lady Eddy...

216
00:10:59,415 --> 00:11:01,168
We've only got your word for it.

217
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:03,245
That's your problem. Not mine.

218
00:11:04,165 --> 00:11:05,722
And where were you, sir?

219
00:11:05,989 --> 00:11:08,760
Quarter past four?
Dear me, let me think...

220
00:11:09,516 --> 00:11:11,254
Ah yes, I remember...

221
00:11:12,775 --> 00:11:16,240
<i>I was in me study reading
through military memoirs.</i>

222
00:11:17,253 --> 00:11:18,905
<i>Fascinating stuff.</i>

223
00:11:19,632 --> 00:11:22,033
<i>Took me back to my days in the army.</i>

224
00:11:22,689 --> 00:11:24,456
<i>Started reminiscing...</i>

225
00:11:24,831 --> 00:11:26,080
<i>Mafeking, you know...</i>

226
00:11:27,442 --> 00:11:28,360
<i>Terrible war.</i>

227
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:30,175
<i>Colonel, snap out of it!</i>

228
00:11:32,997 --> 00:11:35,781
- I was in my study...
- No no no, right out of it!

229
00:11:35,881 --> 00:11:36,840
Oh, sorry.

230
00:11:37,594 --> 00:11:39,960
Got a bit carried away there.

231
00:11:40,298 --> 00:11:43,096
And where were you at
a quarter past four, my lady?

232
00:11:43,933 --> 00:11:45,469
Now let me see...

233
00:11:47,448 --> 00:11:48,760
<i>Yes, I remember.</i>

234
00:11:49,171 --> 00:11:52,438
<i>I was sitting in the Blue Room,
taking my afternoon tea.</i>

235
00:11:52,864 --> 00:11:54,479
<i>It's a ritual of mine,</i>

236
00:11:54,650 --> 00:11:58,126
<i>I needed to gather strength
for the duty of hostess.</i>

237
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:00,682
I then proceeded to the lawn,

238
00:12:00,956 --> 00:12:03,069
where I met you, Doctor.

239
00:12:03,169 --> 00:12:08,016
<i>And I said, 'And who exactly might
you be and what are you doing here?'</i>

240
00:12:08,268 --> 00:12:12,753
<i>And you said, 'I'm the Doctor
and this is Miss Donna Noble.'</i>

241
00:12:12,953 --> 00:12:15,720
Yes, yes, you can stop now,
I was there for that bit.

242
00:12:16,126 --> 00:12:17,360
Of course.

243
00:12:19,148 --> 00:12:20,136
Excuse me.

244
00:12:20,511 --> 00:12:22,360
No alibis for any of them.

245
00:12:23,518 --> 00:12:26,352
The secret adversary remains hidden!

246
00:12:28,278 --> 00:12:32,538
We must look for a motive,
use 'the little grey cells.'

247
00:12:33,023 --> 00:12:35,320
Oh, yes, little grey cells,

248
00:12:35,764 --> 00:12:36,997
good old Poirot.

249
00:12:37,264 --> 00:12:40,300
Do you know, I've been to Belgium, yeah.

250
00:12:41,259 --> 00:12:42,456
I remember...

251
00:12:43,419 --> 00:12:47,213
<i>I was deep in the Ardennes,
trying to find Charlemagne.</i>

252
00:12:47,782 --> 00:12:49,996
<i>He'd been kidnapped
by an insane computer.</i>

253
00:12:50,096 --> 00:12:53,240
<i>- Doctor! Doctor!
- Sorry.</i>

254
00:12:53,890 --> 00:12:55,560
Charlemagne lived centuries ago.

255
00:12:56,061 --> 00:12:57,360
I've got a very good memory.

256
00:12:58,067 --> 00:13:00,600
For such an experienced detective,
you missed a big clue.

257
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:02,373
That bit of paper on the fire?

258
00:13:02,473 --> 00:13:05,800
- You were looking the other way!
- Yeah, but I saw your reflection.

259
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:12,320
You crafty man,
and this is all that was left.

260
00:13:15,907 --> 00:13:17,443
What's that first letter? N or M?

261
00:13:17,543 --> 00:13:18,972
It's an M. The word is maiden.

262
00:13:19,072 --> 00:13:21,525
MAIDEN! What does that mean?

263
00:13:22,563 --> 00:13:26,717
We're still no further forward.
Our nemesis remains at large.

264
00:13:26,933 --> 00:13:28,657
Unless Miss Noble's found something.

265
00:13:37,582 --> 00:13:39,717
You won't find anything in there.

266
00:13:41,036 --> 00:13:44,283
- How come it's locked?
- Lady Eddison commands it to be so.

267
00:13:44,499 --> 00:13:47,109
And I 'command it' to be otherwise.

268
00:13:47,362 --> 00:13:48,646
Scotland Yard, pip-pip.

269
00:13:52,396 --> 00:13:54,198
Why's it locked in the first place?

270
00:13:54,657 --> 00:13:55,904
Many years ago,

271
00:13:56,063 --> 00:13:58,219
when my father was butler to the family,

272
00:13:58,378 --> 00:14:00,845
Lady Eddison returned
from India with malaria.

273
00:14:01,159 --> 00:14:03,946
She locked herself in this room
for six months until she recovered.

274
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:08,439
Since then, the room
has remained undisturbed.

275
00:14:12,328 --> 00:14:13,878
There's nothing in here.

276
00:14:15,219 --> 00:14:16,770
How long's it been empty?

277
00:14:17,037 --> 00:14:18,320
Forty years.

278
00:14:19,121 --> 00:14:20,993
Why would she seal it off?

279
00:14:22,885 --> 00:14:26,693
All right, I need to investigate,
you just... buttle off.

280
00:14:46,449 --> 00:14:48,670
1926, they've still got bees...

281
00:14:51,439 --> 00:14:55,081
Oh, what a noise! All right,
busy bee, I'll let you out.

282
00:14:55,283 --> 00:14:56,256
Hold on.

283
00:14:56,738 --> 00:15:01,274
I shall find you with my
amazing powers of detection.

284
00:15:13,566 --> 00:15:14,878
That's impossible!

285
00:15:18,124 --> 00:15:19,336
Doctor!

286
00:15:25,761 --> 00:15:26,966
Doctor!

287
00:15:32,441 --> 00:15:35,196
It's a giant wasp!

288
00:15:35,456 --> 00:15:39,364
- What d'you mean, a giant wasp?
- I mean a wasp that's giant!

289
00:15:39,464 --> 00:15:41,748
It's only a silly little insect.

290
00:15:41,848 --> 00:15:47,050
When I say giant, I don't mean big!
I mean flippin' enormous!

291
00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:49,204
Look at its sting!

292
00:15:49,891 --> 00:15:50,880
Let me see.

293
00:15:52,303 --> 00:15:54,690
It's gone. Buzzed off.

294
00:15:57,805 --> 00:15:59,457
But that's fascinating...

295
00:15:59,557 --> 00:16:02,709
D-D-D-on't touch it,
don't touch it! Let me...

296
00:16:03,726 --> 00:16:04,840
Giant wasp...

297
00:16:05,664 --> 00:16:09,200
well, tons of amorphous
insectivorous lifeforms,

298
00:16:09,810 --> 00:16:11,498
but none in this galactic vector.

299
00:16:11,657 --> 00:16:14,274
I think I understood
some of those words.

300
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:16,387
Enough to know that
you're completely potty.

301
00:16:16,487 --> 00:16:18,573
Lost its sting though,
that makes it defenceless.

302
00:16:18,673 --> 00:16:21,118
Creature this size,
got to be able to grow a new one.

303
00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:23,036
Can we return to sanity?

304
00:16:23,215 --> 00:16:25,639
There are no such
things as giant wasps!

305
00:16:25,739 --> 00:16:28,760
Exactly. So the question is...

306
00:16:29,208 --> 00:16:30,427
what's it doing here?

307
00:16:32,612 --> 00:16:35,922
A murder! That's put the cat among
the pigeons, and no mistake!

308
00:16:36,088 --> 00:16:39,506
It's not the stuff of gossip, Mrs Hart.
Continue with your work.

309
00:16:39,858 --> 00:16:41,994
But who'd want to do
in the old Professor?

310
00:16:42,094 --> 00:16:44,339
He was always asking questions
about that book of his,

311
00:16:44,439 --> 00:16:45,636
what was all that about?

312
00:16:45,736 --> 00:16:48,392
A dead man's folly, nothing more.

313
00:16:49,481 --> 00:16:51,709
Though perhaps, if he asked about...

314
00:16:53,173 --> 00:16:55,120
I must go and see my lady.

315
00:17:15,197 --> 00:17:17,754
The poor little...

316
00:17:19,065 --> 00:17:20,204
child...

317
00:17:23,572 --> 00:17:24,358
There!

318
00:17:27,033 --> 00:17:28,199
Come on!

319
00:17:28,641 --> 00:17:32,002
Hey, this makes a change... there's
a monster, and we're chasing IT.

320
00:17:32,102 --> 00:17:35,000
Can't be a monster! It's a trick,
they do it with mirrors!

321
00:17:40,717 --> 00:17:45,001
- By all that's holy!
- Oh, but you are wonderful!

322
00:17:47,849 --> 00:17:50,840
Now just stop, stop there...

323
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:56,943
Fly boy!

324
00:18:00,215 --> 00:18:03,511
Don't let it get away! Quick,
before it reverts back to human form.

325
00:18:04,102 --> 00:18:05,660
Where are you? Come on !

326
00:18:05,984 --> 00:18:08,212
There's nowhere to run! Show yourself!

327
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:16,638
That's just cheating!

328
00:18:17,273 --> 00:18:20,410
My faithful companion.
This is terrible.

329
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:24,188
Excuse me, my lady, but... She was
on her way to tell you something.

330
00:18:24,414 --> 00:18:25,835
She never found me.

331
00:18:26,289 --> 00:18:28,799
She had an appointment
with death instead.

332
00:18:28,979 --> 00:18:32,779
She said, 'The poor little child.'
Does that mean anything to anyone?

333
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:35,298
No children in this house for years.

334
00:18:35,875 --> 00:18:38,450
Highly unlikely there will be.

335
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:42,840
Mrs Christie, you must
have twigged something!

336
00:18:43,530 --> 00:18:45,880
You've written simply
the best detective stories.

337
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:48,920
Tell us, what would Poirot do?

338
00:18:49,370 --> 00:18:52,880
Heaven's sake, cards on the table woman!
You should be helping us!

339
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:54,397
But...

340
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:56,971
I'm merely a writer.

341
00:18:57,071 --> 00:18:58,802
Surely you can crack it.

342
00:18:59,177 --> 00:19:02,148
These events, they're exactly
like one of your plots.

343
00:19:02,248 --> 00:19:05,160
That's what I've been saying!
Agatha, that's gotta mean something.

344
00:19:05,357 --> 00:19:06,560
But what?

345
00:19:07,196 --> 00:19:08,520
I've no answers.

346
00:19:09,173 --> 00:19:10,002
None.

347
00:19:10,521 --> 00:19:13,110
I'm sorry, all of you, I'm truly sorry.

348
00:19:13,601 --> 00:19:14,682
But I've failed.

349
00:19:15,295 --> 00:19:17,834
If anyone can help us,
then it's the Doctor, not me.

350
00:19:27,442 --> 00:19:30,040
Do you know what I think?
Those books of yours,

351
00:19:30,666 --> 00:19:32,656
one day, they could
turn them into films!

352
00:19:33,024 --> 00:19:34,784
They could be talking pictures!

353
00:19:35,166 --> 00:19:38,300
Talking pictures? Pictures that talk?

354
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,268
- What do you mean?
- Oh, blimey, I've done it again.

355
00:19:41,794 --> 00:19:43,554
I appreciate you trying to be kind.

356
00:19:44,167 --> 00:19:45,422
But you're right,

357
00:19:45,753 --> 00:19:48,018
these murders are like my own creations.

358
00:19:48,517 --> 00:19:50,263
It's as though someone's mocking me.

359
00:19:50,363 --> 00:19:52,613
And I've had enough
scorn for one lifetime.

360
00:19:52,713 --> 00:19:53,600
Yeah...

361
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:58,866
Thing is, I had this bloke once,
I was engaged,

362
00:19:59,054 --> 00:20:01,839
and I loved him, I really did.

363
00:20:01,939 --> 00:20:04,146
Turns out, he was lying
through his teeth.

364
00:20:04,391 --> 00:20:06,475
But d'you know what? I moved on.

365
00:20:06,787 --> 00:20:10,320
I was lucky, I found the Doctor.
It's changed my life.

366
00:20:11,114 --> 00:20:12,981
There's always someone else.

367
00:20:13,230 --> 00:20:16,194
I see. Is my marriage
the stuff of gossip, now?

368
00:20:16,294 --> 00:20:17,362
No, I just...

369
00:20:18,451 --> 00:20:19,194
Sorry.

370
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:23,360
No matter. The stories are true.

371
00:20:23,723 --> 00:20:25,822
I found my husband with another woman.

372
00:20:26,009 --> 00:20:28,760
A younger, prettier woman.
Isn't it always the way?

373
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:32,046
Well, mine was with
a Giant Spider, but...

374
00:20:32,507 --> 00:20:33,754
same difference.

375
00:20:33,993 --> 00:20:36,748
You and the Doctor talk
such wonderful nonsense.

376
00:20:36,848 --> 00:20:39,956
Agatha, people love
your books, they really do.

377
00:20:40,056 --> 00:20:43,006
They're gonna be reading
them for years to come.

378
00:20:43,106 --> 00:20:44,109
If only.

379
00:20:44,326 --> 00:20:46,540
Try as I might,
it's hardly great literature.

380
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:47,813
Now that's beyond me.

381
00:20:48,895 --> 00:20:53,063
I'm afraid my books will be
forgotten, like ephemera.

382
00:20:55,342 --> 00:20:57,058
Hello, what's that?

383
00:20:58,060 --> 00:21:00,327
Those flower beds
were perfectly neat earlier.

384
00:21:00,427 --> 00:21:02,642
Now some of the stalks are bent over.

385
00:21:07,578 --> 00:21:10,680
There you go! Who'd ever notice that?

386
00:21:11,083 --> 00:21:12,114
You're brilliant!

387
00:21:15,604 --> 00:21:17,360
Someone came here tooled up.

388
00:21:18,022 --> 00:21:19,955
The sort of stuff a thief would use.

389
00:21:20,222 --> 00:21:22,010
The Unicorn? He's here!

390
00:21:22,392 --> 00:21:23,791
The Unicorn and the wasp...

391
00:21:24,642 --> 00:21:26,106
Your drinks, ladies.

392
00:21:26,452 --> 00:21:28,363
- Doctor.
- Very good, Greeves.

393
00:21:31,218 --> 00:21:33,281
How about the science stuff?
What did you find?

394
00:21:34,961 --> 00:21:36,512
Vespiform sting.

395
00:21:36,778 --> 00:21:39,320
Vespiforms have got hives
in the Silfrax galaxy.

396
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:41,330
Again, you talk like Edward Lear.

397
00:21:41,430 --> 00:21:44,864
But for some reason, this one's behaving
like a character in one of your books.

398
00:21:44,964 --> 00:21:47,395
Come on, Agatha,
what would Miss Marple do?

399
00:21:47,614 --> 00:21:50,023
She'd have overheard something
vital because the murderer

400
00:21:50,123 --> 00:21:51,861
thinks she's a harmless old lady.

401
00:21:52,128 --> 00:21:53,441
Clever idea.

402
00:21:54,544 --> 00:21:56,860
Miss Marple? Who writes those?

403
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:00,089
Um... Copyright Donna Noble,
add it to the list.

404
00:22:00,189 --> 00:22:02,137
- Donna...
- OK, we could split the copyright.

405
00:22:02,237 --> 00:22:02,874
No.

406
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:05,260
Something's inhibiting my enzymes.

407
00:22:08,095 --> 00:22:09,458
I've been poisoned!

408
00:22:10,236 --> 00:22:12,710
What do we do? What do we do?

409
00:22:12,810 --> 00:22:15,054
Bitter almonds! It's cyanide!

410
00:22:15,228 --> 00:22:16,858
Sparkling cyanide!

411
00:22:23,449 --> 00:22:24,317
Ginger beer!

412
00:22:24,417 --> 00:22:26,136
- Beg your pardon?
- I need ginger beer!

413
00:22:26,236 --> 00:22:27,603
The gentleman's gone mad!

414
00:22:28,745 --> 00:22:30,431
I'm an expert in poisons, Doctor.

415
00:22:30,531 --> 00:22:32,616
There's no cure! It's fatal!

416
00:22:33,699 --> 00:22:36,440
Not for me! I can stimulate
the inhibited enzymes into reversal...

417
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:38,106
Protein! I need protein!

418
00:22:38,615 --> 00:22:40,678
- Walnuts?
- Brilliant!

419
00:22:43,368 --> 00:22:45,567
I can't understand you!
How many words?

420
00:22:45,870 --> 00:22:47,197
One! One word!

421
00:22:47,297 --> 00:22:50,640
Shake, milk shake, milk?
Milk? No, not milk?

422
00:22:50,976 --> 00:22:53,110
Shake shake shake... Cocktail shaker!

423
00:22:53,210 --> 00:22:55,793
- What do you want, a Harvey Wallbanger?
- Harvey Wallbanger?!

424
00:22:55,893 --> 00:22:58,215
- I don't know!
- How is Harvey Wallbanger one word?!

425
00:22:58,315 --> 00:22:59,619
What do you need, Doctor?!

426
00:22:59,719 --> 00:23:02,843
Salt, I was miming salt!
Salt! I need something salty!

427
00:23:02,943 --> 00:23:05,114
What about this?
What is it?

428
00:23:05,214 --> 00:23:06,592
- Salt!
- That's too salty!

429
00:23:06,692 --> 00:23:09,152
- Oh, that's too salty!
- What about this?!

430
00:23:10,075 --> 00:23:11,582
- What's that?
- Anchovies!

431
00:23:11,828 --> 00:23:13,349
What is it? What else?

432
00:23:13,939 --> 00:23:16,426
It's a song? Mammy?

433
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:19,130
I don't know, Camptown Races?

434
00:23:19,230 --> 00:23:20,577
Camptown Races?

435
00:23:20,677 --> 00:23:23,043
All right then, Towering Inferno!

436
00:23:23,143 --> 00:23:25,102
It's a shock! Look!
Shock! I need a shock!

437
00:23:25,202 --> 00:23:27,792
Right then, big shock coming up.

438
00:23:42,181 --> 00:23:42,982
Detox!

439
00:23:45,042 --> 00:23:46,585
I must do that more often!

440
00:23:47,494 --> 00:23:49,440
I mean the detox.

441
00:23:49,917 --> 00:23:52,152
Doctor, you are impossible!

442
00:23:52,934 --> 00:23:54,347
Who are you?

443
00:23:59,362 --> 00:24:01,359
A terrible day for all of us.

444
00:24:02,088 --> 00:24:03,818
The Professor struck down.

445
00:24:04,655 --> 00:24:07,410
Miss Chandrakala, cruelly taken from us.

446
00:24:07,781 --> 00:24:09,418
And yet, we still take dinner.

447
00:24:09,663 --> 00:24:11,228
We are British, Doctor.

448
00:24:12,274 --> 00:24:14,264
What else must we do?

449
00:24:14,364 --> 00:24:16,400
Then, someone tried to poison me.

450
00:24:17,551 --> 00:24:20,573
Any one of you had the chance
to put cyanide in my drink.

451
00:24:21,236 --> 00:24:23,933
- But it rather gave me an idea.
- And what would that be?

452
00:24:24,344 --> 00:24:25,116
Well.

453
00:24:25,628 --> 00:24:26,501
Poison.

454
00:24:27,352 --> 00:24:28,188
Drink up!

455
00:24:31,311 --> 00:24:33,800
I've laced the soup with pepper.

456
00:24:34,138 --> 00:24:36,359
Ah, I thought it was jolly spicy.

457
00:24:36,459 --> 00:24:39,534
But the active ingredient
of pepper is piperine.

458
00:24:40,133 --> 00:24:43,039
Traditionally used as an insecticide.

459
00:24:46,048 --> 00:24:48,200
So... Anyone got the shivers?

460
00:24:53,123 --> 00:24:55,647
- What the deuce is that?!
- Listen! Listen!

461
00:24:55,906 --> 00:24:58,560
No, it can't be...

462
00:25:03,979 --> 00:25:05,818
Show yourself, demon!

463
00:25:05,918 --> 00:25:07,280
Nobody move!

464
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:11,160
No, don't. .. stay where you are!

465
00:25:18,744 --> 00:25:20,540
Out, out, out!

466
00:25:23,822 --> 00:25:26,418
Not you, Agatha.
You've got a long life to lead yet.

467
00:25:26,518 --> 00:25:29,649
- Well, we know the butler didn't do it!
- Then who did?

468
00:25:38,142 --> 00:25:39,245
My jewellery.

469
00:25:40,269 --> 00:25:42,418
The Firestone, it's gone!

470
00:25:42,904 --> 00:25:45,175
- Stolen!
- Roger.

471
00:25:49,182 --> 00:25:52,766
My son. My child!

472
00:26:13,955 --> 00:26:15,657
That poor footman.

473
00:26:17,104 --> 00:26:19,411
Roger's dead and
he can't even mourn him.

474
00:26:19,909 --> 00:26:22,339
1926, it's more like the Dark Ages.

475
00:26:23,096 --> 00:26:25,166
Did you enquire after the necklace?

476
00:26:25,375 --> 00:26:27,328
Lady Eddison brought it back from India.

477
00:26:27,428 --> 00:26:31,160
- It's worth thousands.
- This thing can sting, it can fly,

478
00:26:32,686 --> 00:26:36,148
it could wipe us all out in seconds.
Why's it playing this game?

479
00:26:36,248 --> 00:26:38,661
Every murder is essentially the same.

480
00:26:38,761 --> 00:26:41,620
They are committed because
somebody wants something.

481
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:44,409
- But what does a Vespiform want?
- Doctor, stop it.

482
00:26:44,509 --> 00:26:46,751
The murderer is as human as you or I.

483
00:26:48,237 --> 00:26:53,133
You're right... I've been so caught up
with Giant Wasps, I've forgotten.

484
00:26:53,457 --> 00:26:55,820
- You're the expert!
- I'm not, I've told you.

485
00:26:56,003 --> 00:26:58,794
I'm just a purveyor of nonsense.

486
00:26:58,894 --> 00:27:02,778
No, cos plenty of people write detective
stories, but yours are the best,

487
00:27:02,878 --> 00:27:05,940
and why?
Why are you so good, Agatha Christie?

488
00:27:06,546 --> 00:27:08,104
Because you understand!

489
00:27:08,854 --> 00:27:09,936
You've lived,

490
00:27:10,895 --> 00:27:12,856
you've fought,
you've had your heart broken.

491
00:27:14,147 --> 00:27:15,590
You know about people,

492
00:27:16,141 --> 00:27:20,086
their passions, their hope and despair
and anger, all of those,

493
00:27:20,259 --> 00:27:24,745
tiny, huge things that can turn
the most ordinary person into a killer.

494
00:27:26,126 --> 00:27:27,835
Just think, Agatha!

495
00:27:28,131 --> 00:27:31,560
If anyone can solve this, it's you!

496
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:37,487
I've called you here,
on this endless night,

497
00:27:38,461 --> 00:27:40,833
because we have a murderer in our midst.

498
00:27:41,086 --> 00:27:43,840
And when it comes to detection,
there's none finer.

499
00:27:44,187 --> 00:27:47,829
Ladies and gentlemen. I give you...
Agatha Christie.

500
00:27:51,258 --> 00:27:52,938
This is a crooked house.

501
00:27:53,472 --> 00:27:55,000
A house of secrets.

502
00:27:56,371 --> 00:27:59,080
To understand the solution,
we must examine them all.

503
00:28:00,409 --> 00:28:01,765
Starting with you,

504
00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:03,920
Miss Redmond.

505
00:28:06,917 --> 00:28:08,749
But I'm innocent, surely?

506
00:28:09,174 --> 00:28:10,674
You've never met these people.

507
00:28:11,019 --> 00:28:13,240
And these people had never met you!

508
00:28:14,242 --> 00:28:18,060
I think the real Robina Redmond never
left London. You're impersonating her!

509
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:20,800
How silly! What proof do you have?

510
00:28:21,769 --> 00:28:23,760
You said you'd been to the toilet.

511
00:28:24,783 --> 00:28:27,675
Oh, I know this!
If she was really posh, she'd say loo.

512
00:28:27,862 --> 00:28:31,742
Earlier today, Miss Noble and I
found this on the lawn.

513
00:28:32,373 --> 00:28:34,522
Right beneath your bathroom window.

514
00:28:35,149 --> 00:28:37,820
You heard Miss Noble was searching
the bedrooms and panicked.

515
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:40,109
You ran upstairs and disposed
of the evidence...

516
00:28:44,133 --> 00:28:46,275
I've never seen that thing
before in my life!

517
00:28:47,090 --> 00:28:48,280
What's inside it?

518
00:28:48,837 --> 00:28:51,462
The tools of your trade, Miss Redmond.

519
00:28:52,046 --> 00:28:53,683
Or should I say...

520
00:28:54,577 --> 00:28:55,767
the Unicorn!

521
00:28:57,441 --> 00:29:00,200
You came to this house
with one sole intention.

522
00:29:00,607 --> 00:29:02,439
To steal the Firestone!

523
00:29:03,672 --> 00:29:05,294
Oh, all right then.

524
00:29:06,210 --> 00:29:07,520
It's a fair cop.

525
00:29:08,447 --> 00:29:10,163
Yes, I'm the bleedin' Unicorn!

526
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:13,402
Ever so nice to meet ya, I don't fink.

527
00:29:13,502 --> 00:29:15,983
I took my chance in the dark,
and nabbed it.

528
00:29:16,675 --> 00:29:18,168
Go on then, you knobs.

529
00:29:19,001 --> 00:29:22,280
Arrest me, sling me in jail!

530
00:29:23,739 --> 00:29:26,508
- So is she the murderer?
- Don't be so thick!

531
00:29:26,994 --> 00:29:29,460
I might be a thief,
but I ain't no killer.

532
00:29:29,807 --> 00:29:30,520
Quite.

533
00:29:31,105 --> 00:29:32,820
There are darker motives at work.

534
00:29:32,992 --> 00:29:34,715
And in examining this household,

535
00:29:35,811 --> 00:29:37,023
we come to you,

536
00:29:38,014 --> 00:29:38,901
Colonel!

537
00:29:43,070 --> 00:29:44,240
Damn it, woman!

538
00:29:44,577 --> 00:29:46,762
You with your perspicacity!

539
00:29:46,971 --> 00:29:48,623
You've rumbled me!

540
00:29:50,331 --> 00:29:52,018
Hugh! You can walk!

541
00:29:52,992 --> 00:29:53,973
But why?!

542
00:29:54,232 --> 00:29:58,833
My darling, how else could I be certain
of keeping you by my side?

543
00:29:58,933 --> 00:30:00,047
I don't understand.

544
00:30:00,147 --> 00:30:02,260
You're still a beautiful woman,
Clemency.

545
00:30:02,426 --> 00:30:04,799
Sooner or later some chap
will turn your head.

546
00:30:05,404 --> 00:30:06,919
I couldn't bear that.

547
00:30:07,268 --> 00:30:11,560
Staying in the chair was the only way
I could be certain of keeping you.

548
00:30:12,489 --> 00:30:15,929
Confound it, Mrs Christie,
how did you discover the truth?

549
00:30:16,060 --> 00:30:16,723
Um.

550
00:30:16,823 --> 00:30:19,954
Actually, I had no idea. I was just
going to say you're completely innocent

551
00:30:22,038 --> 00:30:22,838
Sorry.

552
00:30:23,617 --> 00:30:25,016
Shall I sit down then?

553
00:30:25,116 --> 00:30:26,840
I think you better had.

554
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:31,271
- So he's not the murderer?
- Indeed not.

555
00:30:32,245 --> 00:30:34,856
To find the truth, let's return...

556
00:30:36,327 --> 00:30:37,113
to this.

557
00:30:38,441 --> 00:30:41,650
Far more than the Unicorn's
object of desire.

558
00:30:43,194 --> 00:30:45,617
The Firestone has quite a history.

559
00:30:47,715 --> 00:30:50,000
- Lady Eddison...
- I've done nothing!

560
00:30:50,181 --> 00:30:52,157
You brought it back
from India, did you not?

561
00:30:52,257 --> 00:30:53,931
Before you met the Colonel.

562
00:30:55,013 --> 00:30:56,736
You came home with malaria,

563
00:30:57,318 --> 00:31:00,520
and confined yourself
to this house for six months,

564
00:31:00,693 --> 00:31:02,727
in a room that has been kept
locked ever since.

565
00:31:02,827 --> 00:31:04,645
- Which I rather think means...
- Stop.

566
00:31:04,745 --> 00:31:06,600
- Please.
- I'm so sorry.

567
00:31:06,974 --> 00:31:08,878
But you had fallen pregnant in India.

568
00:31:09,484 --> 00:31:11,240
Unmarried and ashamed,

569
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:14,100
you hurried back to England
with your confidante, a young maid,

570
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:16,281
later to become housekeeper.
Miss Chandrakala.

571
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:18,280
Clemency, is this true?

572
00:31:19,187 --> 00:31:20,520
My poor baby.

573
00:31:20,969 --> 00:31:22,440
I had to give him away.

574
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:23,912
The shame of it.

575
00:31:24,244 --> 00:31:25,975
But you've never said a word...

576
00:31:26,075 --> 00:31:28,640
I had no choice. Imagine the scandal.

577
00:31:29,155 --> 00:31:32,440
The family name!
I'm British, I carry on!

578
00:31:33,119 --> 00:31:35,720
And it was no ordinary pregnancy.

579
00:31:36,747 --> 00:31:37,944
How can you know that?

580
00:31:38,044 --> 00:31:41,233
Scuse me, Agatha, this is my territory.
But when you heard that buzzing sound

581
00:31:41,333 --> 00:31:43,692
in the dining room, you said,
'It can't be.'

582
00:31:44,885 --> 00:31:46,356
Why did you say that?

583
00:31:46,810 --> 00:31:49,406
- You'd never believe it.
- The Doctor has opened my mind

584
00:31:49,506 --> 00:31:52,096
to believe... many things.

585
00:31:52,989 --> 00:31:54,749
It was forty years ago

586
00:31:54,929 --> 00:31:57,085
<i>in the heat of Delhi, late one night...</i>

587
00:32:00,146 --> 00:32:02,952
<i>I was alone.
And that's when I saw it...</i>

588
00:32:03,146 --> 00:32:05,454
<i>A dazzling light in the sky.</i>

589
00:32:06,249 --> 00:32:08,513
The next day, he came to the house...

590
00:32:09,004 --> 00:32:09,927
<i>Christopher.</i>

591
00:32:10,027 --> 00:32:12,321
<i>The most handsome man I'd ever seen.</i>

592
00:32:12,902 --> 00:32:16,496
<i>Our love blazed like a wildfire.</i>

593
00:32:17,549 --> 00:32:19,474
<i>I held nothing back.</i>

594
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:27,800
And in return he showed me
the incredible truth about himself...

595
00:32:28,410 --> 00:32:31,410
<i>He'd made himself human,
to learn about us.</i>

596
00:32:31,792 --> 00:32:34,698
<i>This was his true shape.</i>

597
00:32:35,766 --> 00:32:38,225
I loved him so much, it didn't matter.

598
00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:40,447
But he was stolen from me.

599
00:32:40,547 --> 00:32:43,204
1885, the year of the great monsoon.

600
00:32:44,463 --> 00:32:47,528
The River Jumna rose up
and broke its banks.

601
00:32:47,628 --> 00:32:49,381
He was taken at the flood.

602
00:32:51,613 --> 00:32:56,048
<i>But Christopher left me a gift,
a jewel like no other.</i>

603
00:32:56,214 --> 00:32:58,789
<i>I wore it always.
Part of me never forgot.</i>

604
00:32:59,551 --> 00:33:00,770
<i>I kept it close.</i>

605
00:33:02,536 --> 00:33:03,618
Always.

606
00:33:03,718 --> 00:33:05,198
Just like a man,

607
00:33:05,396 --> 00:33:08,231
flashes his family jewels,
and you end up with a bun in the oven!

608
00:33:08,331 --> 00:33:10,119
A 'poor little child.'

609
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:14,274
Forty years ago, Miss Chandrakala took
that newborn babe to an orphanage.

610
00:33:14,374 --> 00:33:16,463
But Professor Peach worked it out.

611
00:33:16,563 --> 00:33:18,929
- He found the birth certificate.
- Oh, that's Maiden...

612
00:33:19,029 --> 00:33:20,790
maiden name! Precisely.

613
00:33:20,973 --> 00:33:23,100
- So she killed him?
- I did not!

614
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:26,800
Miss Chandrakala feared that
the Professor had unearthed your secret.

615
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:29,049
- She was coming to warn you.
- So she killed her?

616
00:33:29,149 --> 00:33:31,379
- I did not!
- Lady Eddison...

617
00:33:32,251 --> 00:33:33,246
is innocent.

618
00:33:34,429 --> 00:33:36,760
Because at this point... Doctor.

619
00:33:37,905 --> 00:33:42,369
Thank you. At this point, when
we consider the lies and the secrets,

620
00:33:42,469 --> 00:33:45,737
and the key to these events,
then we have to consider...

621
00:33:46,339 --> 00:33:48,387
It was you, Donna Noble!

622
00:33:49,512 --> 00:33:51,648
What?! Who did I kill?!

623
00:33:51,748 --> 00:33:54,600
No, but you said it,
all along, the vital clue...

624
00:33:55,012 --> 00:33:58,957
That this whole thing is being acted out
like a murder mystery. Which means...

625
00:33:59,923 --> 00:34:02,397
It was you, Agatha Christie!

626
00:34:02,923 --> 00:34:04,863
I beg your pardon, sir!

627
00:34:04,963 --> 00:34:07,437
- So she killed them?
- No, but she wrote!

628
00:34:07,537 --> 00:34:11,389
She wrote those brilliant, clever books!
And who's her greatest admirer?

629
00:34:11,807 --> 00:34:13,733
The moving finger points...

630
00:34:14,216 --> 00:34:15,146
At you,

631
00:34:15,593 --> 00:34:17,880
- Lady Eddison!
- Leave me alone!

632
00:34:18,348 --> 00:34:21,160
- So she did kill them?
- No! But just think...

633
00:34:21,903 --> 00:34:23,938
Last Thursday night,
what were you doing?

634
00:34:24,580 --> 00:34:27,672
I was... I was in the library...

635
00:34:30,006 --> 00:34:32,008
<i>I was reading my favourite
Agatha Christie,</i>

636
00:34:32,108 --> 00:34:35,519
<i>thinking about her plots,
and how clever she must be.</i>

637
00:34:35,779 --> 00:34:37,168
How is that relevant?

638
00:34:37,268 --> 00:34:38,278
Just think.

639
00:34:38,948 --> 00:34:41,352
What else happened on Thursday night?

640
00:34:45,099 --> 00:34:46,002
I'm sorry?

641
00:34:46,102 --> 00:34:48,180
You said, on the lawn, this afternoon.

642
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:51,210
Last Thursday night,
those boys broke into your church.

643
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:54,075
That's correct, they did.

644
00:34:58,340 --> 00:34:59,783
<i>I discovered the two of them.</i>

645
00:35:00,036 --> 00:35:02,833
<i>Thieves in the night,
I was most perturbed.</i>

646
00:35:03,979 --> 00:35:07,239
What the blazes are you doing boys?

647
00:35:09,580 --> 00:35:11,530
But I apprehended them.

648
00:35:12,147 --> 00:35:12,930
Really?

649
00:35:13,030 --> 00:35:15,240
A man of God, against two strong lads?

650
00:35:15,443 --> 00:35:16,690
A man in his forties?

651
00:35:17,022 --> 00:35:21,880
Or should I say,
forty years old, exactly?

652
00:35:22,394 --> 00:35:23,542
Oh, my God.

653
00:35:25,671 --> 00:35:29,720
Lady Eddison. Your child,
how old would he be now?

654
00:35:30,027 --> 00:35:30,856
Forty.

655
00:35:31,190 --> 00:35:32,543
He's forty!

656
00:35:33,351 --> 00:35:34,820
Your child has come home.

657
00:35:35,795 --> 00:35:38,312
- This is poppycock!
- Oh?

658
00:35:39,090 --> 00:35:41,984
You said you were taught
by the Christian Fathers. Meaning,

659
00:35:42,084 --> 00:35:43,614
raised in an orphanage!

660
00:35:43,714 --> 00:35:44,523
My son.

661
00:35:45,164 --> 00:35:46,120
Can it be?

662
00:35:46,610 --> 00:35:49,542
You found those thieves, Reverend.
And you got angry!

663
00:35:50,169 --> 00:35:52,420
A proper, deep anger,
for the first time in your life,

664
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:54,090
and it broke the genetic lock!

665
00:35:55,066 --> 00:35:56,126
You've changed!

666
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:05,100
Put tho-z-z-ze thing-z-z-z
back where you found them.

667
00:36:16,162 --> 00:36:17,972
You realised your inheritance!

668
00:36:18,549 --> 00:36:22,440
After all those years,
you knew who you were.

669
00:36:22,865 --> 00:36:24,665
Oh, and then it all kicks off. Cos this,

670
00:36:24,765 --> 00:36:27,845
isn't just a jewel, it's a Vespiform
Telepathic Recorder!

671
00:36:28,472 --> 00:36:32,560
It's part of you, your brain,
your very essence.

672
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:34,078
And when you activated.

673
00:36:34,178 --> 00:36:35,630
So did the Firestone!

674
00:36:35,730 --> 00:36:38,903
It beamed your full identity
directly into your mind,

675
00:36:39,003 --> 00:36:40,722
and at the same time.

676
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:45,013
<i>It absorbed the works of Agatha
Christie, directly from Lady Eddison.</i>

677
00:36:45,654 --> 00:36:47,299
<i>It all became part of you!</i>

678
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:51,760
<i>The mechanics of those novels
formed a template in your brain!</i>

679
00:36:52,580 --> 00:36:56,230
You've killed, in this pattern, because
that's what you think the world is!

680
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:59,000
Turns out we are in the middle
of a murder mystery!

681
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:00,686
One of yours, Dame Agatha!

682
00:37:01,284 --> 00:37:01,926
Dame?

683
00:37:02,258 --> 00:37:04,260
Oh, sorry, not yet.

684
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:05,388
So he killed them?

685
00:37:05,784 --> 00:37:07,550
Yes? Definitely?

686
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:09,237
Yes.

687
00:37:09,612 --> 00:37:10,362
Well.

688
00:37:11,610 --> 00:37:14,270
This has certainly been
an entertaining evening.

689
00:37:15,749 --> 00:37:19,590
Really, you can't believe any
of this surely, Lady Eddiz-z-z-z-on?

690
00:37:20,292 --> 00:37:21,190
Lady who?

691
00:37:22,180 --> 00:37:23,970
Lady Eddiz-z-z-z-on.

692
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:27,760
- Little bit of buzzing there, Vicar.
- Don't make me angry!

693
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:30,080
Why, what happens then?

694
00:37:30,931 --> 00:37:33,909
Damn it, you humanz-z-z-z-z-z-z!

695
00:37:34,299 --> 00:37:37,308
Worshipping your tribal sky godz-z-z-z!

696
00:37:37,582 --> 00:37:39,219
I am so much more!

697
00:37:39,486 --> 00:37:42,440
That night. The universe
exploded in my mind!

698
00:37:42,616 --> 00:37:45,160
I wanted to take what waz-z-z mine.

699
00:37:45,436 --> 00:37:51,640
And you, Agatha Christie, with your
railway station bookstall romancez-z-z.

700
00:37:52,064 --> 00:37:54,364
What'z-z-z- to stop me killing you?

701
00:37:54,464 --> 00:37:57,040
Oh, my dear God, my child!

702
00:37:57,140 --> 00:38:00,046
What'z-z-z to stop me killing you all?

703
00:38:03,285 --> 00:38:05,549
- Forgive me!
- No, no Clemency, come back!

704
00:38:05,649 --> 00:38:07,540
Keep away, keep away my darling!

705
00:38:07,893 --> 00:38:08,549
No!

706
00:38:08,881 --> 00:38:10,800
No! No more murder!

707
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:12,617
If my imagination made you kill,

708
00:38:12,717 --> 00:38:16,600
then my imagination will find
a way to stop you, foul creature!

709
00:38:20,657 --> 00:38:22,920
Wait! Now it's chasing us!

710
00:38:30,242 --> 00:38:32,580
<i>Over here! Come and get me, Reverend!</i>

711
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:34,041
Agatha, what are you doing?

712
00:38:34,590 --> 00:38:36,948
If I started this, Doctor,
then I must stop it!

713
00:38:39,859 --> 00:38:40,640
Come on!

714
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:56,080
It's all my fault, it's all my fault,
it's all my fault!

715
00:38:58,602 --> 00:39:01,110
You said this is the night
Agatha Christie loses her memory.

716
00:39:01,210 --> 00:39:02,654
Time is in flux, Donna!

717
00:39:02,850 --> 00:39:06,621
This could be the night Agatha Christie
loses her life and history gets changed!

718
00:39:06,721 --> 00:39:07,846
Where's she going?

719
00:39:20,108 --> 00:39:20,869
The lake!

720
00:39:20,969 --> 00:39:22,973
She's heading for the lake.
What's she doing?

721
00:39:31,381 --> 00:39:32,170
Here I am!

722
00:39:32,601 --> 00:39:34,102
The honey in the trap!

723
00:39:34,897 --> 00:39:37,431
- Come to me, Vespiform.
- She's controlling it.

724
00:39:37,531 --> 00:39:40,230
Its mind is based on her thought
processes, they're linked.

725
00:39:40,330 --> 00:39:41,360
Quite so, Doctor!

726
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:44,696
If l die, then this creature
might die with me.

727
00:39:45,591 --> 00:39:46,600
Don't hurt her!

728
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:50,130
You're not meant to be like this, you've
got the wrong template in your mind.

729
00:39:50,230 --> 00:39:51,240
<i>It's not listening.</i>

730
00:40:16,230 --> 00:40:17,737
How do you kill a wasp?

731
00:40:18,807 --> 00:40:19,658
Drown it.

732
00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:21,692
Just like his father.

733
00:40:21,792 --> 00:40:23,650
Donna, that thing couldn't help itself.

734
00:40:24,024 --> 00:40:25,197
Neither could I.

735
00:40:30,127 --> 00:40:32,030
Death comes as the end.

736
00:40:32,390 --> 00:40:34,056
And justice is served.

737
00:40:35,296 --> 00:40:36,992
Murder at the Vicar's Rage.

738
00:40:39,038 --> 00:40:40,364
Needs a bit of work.

739
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:42,860
Just one mystery left, Doctor.

740
00:40:44,169 --> 00:40:46,109
Who exactly are you?

741
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:52,670
Oh, it's the Firestone,
it's part of the Vespiform's mind!

742
00:40:52,890 --> 00:40:55,132
It's dying, and it's
connected to Agatha.

743
00:41:04,450 --> 00:41:05,550
It let her go.

744
00:41:06,689 --> 00:41:09,640
Right at the end, the Vespiform
chose to save someone's life.

745
00:41:10,210 --> 00:41:11,556
Is she all right, though?

746
00:41:11,656 --> 00:41:13,567
Oh, of course. The amnesia!

747
00:41:13,667 --> 00:41:16,088
Wiped her mind of everything
the wasp, the murders.

748
00:41:16,351 --> 00:41:17,200
And us.

749
00:41:18,003 --> 00:41:19,554
She'll forget about us.

750
00:41:19,654 --> 00:41:21,437
Yeah but we've solved another riddle.

751
00:41:21,825 --> 00:41:23,618
The Mystery of Agatha Christie.

752
00:41:24,220 --> 00:41:27,720
And tomorrow morning, her car
gets found by the side of a lake.

753
00:41:28,891 --> 00:41:32,350
<i>A few days later she turns up
in a hotel in Harrogate,</i>

754
00:41:32,695 --> 00:41:34,516
<i>with no idea of what just happened.</i>

755
00:41:40,341 --> 00:41:41,880
<i>No-one'll ever know.</i>

756
00:41:43,530 --> 00:41:47,030
<i>Lady Eddison, and the Colonel
and all the staff, what about them?</i>

757
00:41:47,130 --> 00:41:49,274
A shameful story.
They'd never talk of it.

758
00:41:49,374 --> 00:41:50,400
Too British.

759
00:41:51,152 --> 00:41:54,468
While the Unicorn does a bunk,
back to London town.

760
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,953
She could never even say she was there.

761
00:41:57,867 --> 00:41:59,181
But what happens to Agatha?

762
00:41:59,418 --> 00:42:00,551
Oh, great life!

763
00:42:00,958 --> 00:42:05,860
Met another man, married again, saw
the world, wrote and wrote and wrote.

764
00:42:06,061 --> 00:42:08,194
She never thought her books
were any good, though.

765
00:42:08,469 --> 00:42:10,747
And she must've spent
all those years wondering.

766
00:42:13,565 --> 00:42:17,594
Thing is, I don't think
she ever quite forgot.

767
00:42:18,470 --> 00:42:20,353
A great mind like that!
Some of the details

768
00:42:20,453 --> 00:42:21,805
kept bleeding through,

769
00:42:22,361 --> 00:42:25,280
all the stuff her imagination could use.
Like Miss Marple!

770
00:42:25,743 --> 00:42:28,815
- I should've made her sign a contract.
- And where is it, where is it?

771
00:42:28,915 --> 00:42:29,797
Hold on.

772
00:42:31,643 --> 00:42:32,632
Here we go.

773
00:42:36,064 --> 00:42:36,664
C.

774
00:42:39,568 --> 00:42:44,351
That is C for Cybermen,
C for Carrionites.

775
00:42:47,020 --> 00:42:47,778
And.

776
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:50,606
Christie, Agatha!

777
00:42:51,425 --> 00:42:52,552
Look at that.

778
00:42:52,652 --> 00:42:53,934
She did remember.

779
00:42:54,100 --> 00:42:56,587
Somewhere in the back
of her mind, it all lingered.

780
00:42:58,490 --> 00:42:59,803
And that's not all.

781
00:42:59,903 --> 00:43:01,321
Look at the copyright page.

782
00:43:05,590 --> 00:43:06,895
Facsimile edition.

783
00:43:07,558 --> 00:43:08,920
Published in the year.

784
00:43:11,876 --> 00:43:13,090
5 billion!

785
00:43:13,678 --> 00:43:15,242
People never stop reading them.

786
00:43:15,918 --> 00:43:19,120
She is the best selling
novelist of all time.

787
00:43:21,451 --> 00:43:22,489
But she never knew.

788
00:43:22,589 --> 00:43:24,322
Well, no-one knows how they're
going to be remembered.

789
00:43:24,422 --> 00:43:26,150
All you can do is hope for the best.

790
00:43:26,250 --> 00:43:28,183
Maybe that's what kept her writing.

791
00:43:29,171 --> 00:43:30,961
Same thing keeps me travelling.

792
00:43:32,327 --> 00:43:33,360
Onwards?

793
00:43:34,698 --> 00:43:35,620
Onwards!

794
00:43:40,820 --> 00:43:43,678
This is the biggest library
in the universe. So where is everyone?

795
00:43:46,144 --> 00:43:48,469
Run, for God's sake run.

796
00:43:48,569 --> 00:43:49,354
Run!

797
00:43:54,491 --> 00:43:57,150
Professor River Song, archaeologist.

798
00:43:57,250 --> 00:43:58,800
The shadows are moving again.

799
00:43:58,900 --> 00:44:01,560
- How could a shadow be infected?
- It's Vashta Nerada.

800
00:44:01,660 --> 00:44:02,500
Run!

801
00:44:03,352 --> 00:44:05,840
<i>Something came to this library
and killed everything in it.</i>

802
00:44:06,261 --> 00:44:07,769
- Donna?
- Yeah?

803
00:44:08,580 --> 00:44:10,000
Stay out of the shadows.

804
