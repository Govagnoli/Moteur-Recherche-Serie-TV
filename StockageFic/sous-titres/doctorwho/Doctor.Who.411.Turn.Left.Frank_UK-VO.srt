1
00:00:27,488 --> 00:00:29,997
You're gonna love this.
One, two, three.

2
00:00:33,132 --> 00:00:34,020
It's lovely!

3
00:00:38,328 --> 00:00:39,861
You want to buy Shukina?

4
00:00:43,139 --> 00:00:46,279
<i>Or Peshwami? Most beautiful
Peshwami in all of Shan Shen.</i>

5
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:47,820
Er, no, thanks.

6
00:00:57,271 --> 00:00:58,923
Tell your fortune, lady?

7
00:00:59,023 --> 00:01:00,518
The future predicted.

8
00:01:00,618 --> 00:01:03,671
- Your life foretold.
- Oh, no, thanks.

9
00:01:04,143 --> 00:01:07,427
Don't you want to know
if you're going to be happy?

10
00:01:08,628 --> 00:01:10,455
I'm happy right now, thanks.

11
00:01:10,743 --> 00:01:11,976
You've got red hair.

12
00:01:12,076 --> 00:01:14,273
The reading's free for red hair.

13
00:01:15,669 --> 00:01:16,601
All right, then.

14
00:01:28,851 --> 00:01:30,909
Oh, you're fascinating!

15
00:01:31,235 --> 00:01:33,142
No, but you're good.

16
00:01:33,846 --> 00:01:36,611
I can see... a man.

17
00:01:37,262 --> 00:01:39,750
The most remarkable man.

18
00:01:40,202 --> 00:01:41,499
How did you meet him?

19
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:43,119
You're supposed to tell me.

20
00:01:43,551 --> 00:01:44,959
I see the future.

21
00:01:45,578 --> 00:01:46,873
Tell me the past.

22
00:01:47,248 --> 00:01:49,113
When did your lives cross?

23
00:01:50,521 --> 00:01:52,110
It's sort of complicated.

24
00:01:52,472 --> 00:01:54,780
I ended up in his spaceship
on my wedding day.

25
00:01:55,206 --> 00:01:58,140
- Long story.
- But what led you to that meeting?

26
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:00,369
All sorts of things,

27
00:02:01,902 --> 00:02:04,004
but my job, I suppose.

28
00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:07,452
It was on Earth,
this planet called Earth. Miles away.

29
00:02:07,789 --> 00:02:09,876
But I had this job, as a temp,

30
00:02:10,425 --> 00:02:12,950
I was a secretary,
in a place called HC Clements.

31
00:02:14,085 --> 00:02:16,070
<i>HC Clements, can I help you?</i>

32
00:02:21,695 --> 00:02:22,638
Sorry.

33
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:24,684
It's the incense.

34
00:02:25,009 --> 00:02:27,368
Just breathe deep.

35
00:02:29,113 --> 00:02:32,779
This job of yours.
What choices led you there?

36
00:02:34,431 --> 00:02:37,221
There was a choice.
Six months before.

37
00:02:38,235 --> 00:02:41,110
Cos the agency offered me
this contract with HC Clements.

38
00:02:42,189 --> 00:02:44,622
<i>There was this other job,
my mum knew this man...</i>

39
00:02:44,722 --> 00:02:48,652
Jival, he's called, Jival Chowdry.

40
00:02:49,916 --> 00:02:54,346
He runs that little photocopy
business and he needs a secretary.

41
00:02:54,446 --> 00:02:56,073
I've got a job!

42
00:02:56,173 --> 00:02:58,281
As a temp! This is permanent!

43
00:02:58,469 --> 00:03:00,322
It's 20,000 a year, Donna.

44
00:03:01,023 --> 00:03:03,226
HC Clements is in the City,

45
00:03:03,764 --> 00:03:07,230
it's nice, it's posh, so stop it!

46
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:13,960
Your life could have
gone one way or the other.

47
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:17,670
- What made you decide?
- I just did.

48
00:03:18,121 --> 00:03:19,637
But when was the moment?

49
00:03:20,081 --> 00:03:21,589
When did you choose?

50
00:03:24,279 --> 00:03:26,638
It won't take long, just turn right,

51
00:03:26,738 --> 00:03:30,385
we'll pop in and see Mr Chowdry,
so Suzette can introduce you.

52
00:03:30,485 --> 00:03:32,934
I'm going left,
if you don't like it, get out and walk!

53
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:37,226
If you turn right, you'll have a career.
Not just filling-in.

54
00:03:37,482 --> 00:03:38,858
You think I'm so useless.

55
00:03:38,958 --> 00:03:42,287
Oh, I know why you want
a job with HC Clements, lady.

56
00:03:42,387 --> 00:03:44,008
Cos you think you'll meet a man

57
00:03:44,108 --> 00:03:46,867
with lots of money and your
whole life will change.

58
00:03:46,967 --> 00:03:48,406
Well, let me tell you, sweetheart,

59
00:03:48,506 --> 00:03:52,392
City executives don't need temps.
Except for practice.

60
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,550
Yeah, well, they haven't met me!

61
00:03:59,043 --> 00:04:00,250
You turned left.

62
00:04:02,052 --> 00:04:04,767
<i>What if you'd turned right?
What then?</i>

63
00:04:05,831 --> 00:04:08,090
- Let go of my hands.
- What if it changes?

64
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:12,153
What if you go right?
What if you could still go right?

65
00:04:17,408 --> 00:04:18,278
Stop it!

66
00:04:21,214 --> 00:04:22,096
What's that?!

67
00:04:23,078 --> 00:04:23,992
What's on my back?

68
00:04:24,949 --> 00:04:25,850
What is it?

69
00:04:26,588 --> 00:04:27,452
What's on my back?

70
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:30,112
<i>Make the choice again, Donna Noble,</i>

71
00:04:30,212 --> 00:04:33,790
and change your mind. Turn right!

72
00:04:38,337 --> 00:04:39,630
I'm turning.

73
00:04:41,165 --> 00:04:42,948
Turn right.

74
00:04:44,005 --> 00:04:45,590
<i>Turn right!</i>

75
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:47,415
Turn RIGHT!

76
00:04:48,803 --> 00:04:52,858
Let me tell you, sweetheart,
City executives don't need temps.

77
00:04:52,958 --> 00:04:54,710
Except for practice.

78
00:04:55,254 --> 00:04:56,344
Yeah.

79
00:04:56,812 --> 00:04:58,126
Suppose you're right.

80
00:04:58,226 --> 00:05:02,093
<i>Turn right, and never meet that man.</i>

81
00:05:02,431 --> 00:05:06,129
<i>Turn right and change the world!</i>

82
00:05:30,334 --> 00:05:33,630

# We wish you a merry Christmas
We wish you a merry Christmas #

87
00:05:48,796 --> 00:05:52,615
# We wish you a merry Christmas
and a happy New Year... #

88
00:05:52,715 --> 00:05:54,068
Get out of the way!

89
00:05:56,972 --> 00:05:59,575
Here we are! Feed at the trough!

90
00:05:59,675 --> 00:06:01,273
Mooky says, let's go to the Boardwalk,

91
00:06:01,373 --> 00:06:03,948
- it's 2 for the price of 1.
- Christmas Eve? It'll be heaving!

92
00:06:04,048 --> 00:06:06,620
Well, exactly! Get in and grab 'em!

93
00:06:07,231 --> 00:06:10,295
That's the second round of drinks
you've bought, it was my turn.

94
00:06:10,604 --> 00:06:12,700
I can afford it. Promotion!

95
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:18,455
You are talking to Jival Chowdry's
Personal Assistant, I'll have you know.

96
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:22,892
Capital P, capital A,
£23,000 per annum, merci beaucoup!

97
00:06:22,992 --> 00:06:26,061
- Here's to Mr Chowdry!
- Mr Chowdry!

98
00:06:26,533 --> 00:06:28,006
<i>She gets all the luck.</i>

99
00:06:29,043 --> 00:06:31,603
What's wrong? What is it?

100
00:06:32,426 --> 00:06:33,005
Sorry?

101
00:06:33,105 --> 00:06:34,392
Someone spill a drink on me?

102
00:06:34,492 --> 00:06:35,007
No.

103
00:06:35,808 --> 00:06:38,907
Why d'you keep looking
at my shoulder, what's wrong?

104
00:06:39,143 --> 00:06:39,808
I don't know.

105
00:06:39,908 --> 00:06:42,018
Oh, don't tell me you're
getting all spooky again.

106
00:06:42,118 --> 00:06:45,480
It was bad enough when you saw the ghost
of Earl Mountbatten at the Boat Show.

107
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:46,931
What're you looking at?

108
00:06:47,031 --> 00:06:48,921
- What is it?
- It's like...

109
00:06:50,179 --> 00:06:52,331
It's like there's something I can't see.

110
00:06:52,762 --> 00:06:54,860
<i>No, shut up all of you!</i>

111
00:06:55,037 --> 00:06:57,311
<i>Come and see.
Just look at the sky!</i>

112
00:06:57,489 --> 00:06:59,954
It's a star! It's a Christmas star!

113
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:01,162
Come on, then.

114
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:10,322
What the hell is that?!
Ken Livingston, that's what!

115
00:07:10,422 --> 00:07:13,369
- Spending our money on decorations!
- How much did that cost?!

116
00:07:13,469 --> 00:07:16,560
Don't be so stupid,
it's flying, it's really flying!

117
00:07:21,449 --> 00:07:22,979
That's not a star,

118
00:07:23,173 --> 00:07:24,488
<i>that's a web.</i>

119
00:07:25,482 --> 00:07:28,171
It's heading east,
the middle of the city.

120
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:49,541
Alice, there's a great big
web star thing shooting at people

121
00:07:49,641 --> 00:07:51,120
and you're looking at ME!

122
00:07:52,187 --> 00:07:54,790
There's something on your back!

123
00:07:59,701 --> 00:08:01,746
Donna! Where you going?!

124
00:08:02,097 --> 00:08:05,265
You'll get yourself killed! Donna!!

125
00:08:09,972 --> 00:08:11,023
Fire!

126
00:08:17,604 --> 00:08:20,665
<i>Everyone stay back!
The Thames has been closed.</i>

127
00:08:21,423 --> 00:08:22,710
<i>Return to your homes.</i>

128
00:08:22,810 --> 00:08:25,535
<i>Keep away from the river,
and that's an order.</i>

129
00:08:27,793 --> 00:08:31,404
<i>Trap 1 to Greyhound 15,
what is your report? Over.</i>

130
00:08:31,655 --> 00:08:34,151
From the evidence I'd say
he managed to stop a creature,

131
00:08:34,372 --> 00:08:35,824
some sort of red spider.

132
00:08:36,248 --> 00:08:39,153
<i>Blew up the base underneath the barrier,
flooded the whole thing. Over.</i>

133
00:08:39,253 --> 00:08:41,520
<i>And where is he now? Over.</i>

134
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:45,332
We've found a body, sir. Over.

135
00:08:45,874 --> 00:08:48,407
- Is it him? Over.
- I think so.

136
00:08:48,717 --> 00:08:50,388
<i>Just didn't make it out in time.</i>

137
00:08:55,637 --> 00:08:56,846
The Doctor is dead.

138
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:59,735
<i>It must have happened
too fast for him to regenerate.</i>

139
00:09:06,315 --> 00:09:08,089
<i>Escort the ambulance back to unit base.</i>

140
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:22,870
What happened, what did they find?
Did they find someone?

141
00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:26,455
I don't know.
Bloke called the Doctor or something.

142
00:09:26,555 --> 00:09:27,620
Where is he?

143
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,758
They took him away. He's dead.

144
00:09:32,798 --> 00:09:34,394
I'm sorry. Did you know him?

145
00:09:35,524 --> 00:09:38,306
I mean, they didn't say his name.

146
00:09:38,964 --> 00:09:40,373
It could be any doctor.

147
00:09:41,890 --> 00:09:43,520
I came so far.

148
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:47,421
It could be anyone.

149
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:52,871
- What's your name?
- Donna.

150
00:09:53,514 --> 00:09:56,004
- And you?
- Oh, I was just...

151
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:59,000
passing by, I shouldn't even be here.

152
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:02,511
This is wrong. This is wrong.
This is so wrong.

153
00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:08,223
- Sorry, what was it, Donna what?
- Why d'you keep looking at my back?

154
00:10:08,323 --> 00:10:09,524
- I'm not.
- Yes, you are.

155
00:10:09,624 --> 00:10:11,780
You keep looking behind me,
you're doing it now.

156
00:10:12,142 --> 00:10:14,995
What is it, what's there?
Has someone put something on my back?

157
00:10:26,379 --> 00:10:30,430
You can't sack me!
I'm your Personal Assistant!

158
00:10:30,530 --> 00:10:34,409
You don't have to make a scene,
just come downstairs, and we can talk.

159
00:10:34,509 --> 00:10:36,681
Oh, I'll make a scene,
right in front of a tribunal.

160
00:10:36,781 --> 00:10:38,856
And the first thing I'll say is
"wandering hands"!

161
00:10:39,050 --> 00:10:41,212
You know what it's been like
for the past few months,

162
00:10:41,312 --> 00:10:42,606
ever since that Christmas thing.

163
00:10:42,706 --> 00:10:44,923
Half my contracts were on
the other side of the river,

164
00:10:45,023 --> 00:10:46,597
and the Thames is still closed off.

165
00:10:46,697 --> 00:10:48,928
Look, I can't deliver,
I'm losing a fortune.

166
00:10:49,028 --> 00:10:50,343
Well, sack one of this lot!

167
00:10:50,443 --> 00:10:53,461
Sack Cliff! He just sits there,
I don't know what he does all day.

168
00:10:53,561 --> 00:10:54,348
Sorry, Cliff.

169
00:10:54,448 --> 00:10:57,270
Actually, I'm not sorry,
what DO you do all day?

170
00:10:58,410 --> 00:10:59,440
What the hell?!

171
00:11:05,511 --> 00:11:06,762
Like an earthquake.

172
00:11:07,749 --> 00:11:08,786
That's weird.

173
00:11:09,445 --> 00:11:11,069
Funny sort of clouds...

174
00:11:12,191 --> 00:11:13,200
Who typed this?

175
00:11:13,507 --> 00:11:17,512
I'm your PA, did you get
someone else to type this?

176
00:11:20,029 --> 00:11:21,190
Beatrice!

177
00:11:22,616 --> 00:11:26,192
It sounds impossible,
but the entire hospital has vanished.

178
00:11:26,292 --> 00:11:28,302
<i>The Royal Hope no longer exists.</i>

179
00:11:28,450 --> 00:11:30,676
<i>It's not been destroyed,
there's no wreckage,</i>

180
00:11:30,776 --> 00:11:32,025
<i>it's simply gone.</i>

181
00:11:32,218 --> 00:11:36,874
Reports from bystanders say that
the rain lifted up around the hospital.

182
00:11:37,188 --> 00:11:40,335
Hole punch, having that.
Stapler, mine.

183
00:11:40,435 --> 00:11:43,384
Toy cactus,
you can have that, Beatrice, catch!

184
00:11:43,855 --> 00:11:46,751
Cliff, I'd leave you my mousemat,
but I'm worried you'd cut yourself.

185
00:11:46,851 --> 00:11:48,332
All right, Donna, have some respect.

186
00:11:48,432 --> 00:11:51,015
There's 2,000 people in that hospital.
And it's vanished!

187
00:11:51,115 --> 00:11:54,030
I'll show you vanishing.
Thanks for nothing!

188
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:57,316
Oh, and you know when that
money went missing from the kitty?

189
00:11:57,673 --> 00:11:59,903
Anne Marie. That's all I'm saying.

190
00:12:00,139 --> 00:12:01,784
Anne Marie!

191
00:12:04,201 --> 00:12:06,432
Oh, don't tell me,
the hospital's back!

192
00:12:06,875 --> 00:12:08,785
Well, isn't that wizard?!

193
00:12:09,908 --> 00:12:14,063
To confirm. The Royal Hope Hospital
was returned to its original position.

194
00:12:14,163 --> 00:12:15,731
But with only one survivor.

195
00:12:16,396 --> 00:12:19,773
The only person left alive,
is medical student Oliver Morgenstern.

196
00:12:19,873 --> 00:12:21,839
And there were these creatures.

197
00:12:22,311 --> 00:12:25,455
Like rhinos.
Talking rhinos in black leather...

198
00:12:25,555 --> 00:12:26,535
Rhinos?

199
00:12:26,635 --> 00:12:28,638
Rhinos, could be aliens.

200
00:12:29,539 --> 00:12:32,507
<i>We couldn't breathe,
we were running out of air.</i>

201
00:12:32,607 --> 00:12:36,652
A colleague of mine gave
me the last oxygen tank. Martha.

202
00:12:36,995 --> 00:12:38,319
Martha Jones.

203
00:12:39,291 --> 00:12:40,843
And she died.

204
00:12:41,716 --> 00:12:43,910
Least you've got a hole punch.

205
00:12:44,439 --> 00:12:45,698
And a raffle ticket.

206
00:12:45,798 --> 00:12:49,266
Yeah, well, they can keep the raffle,
I wouldn't take a penny off that man.

207
00:12:49,366 --> 00:12:51,898
Honestly, you two!
There's aliens on the news!

208
00:12:51,998 --> 00:12:54,053
They took that hospital
all the way to the moon,

209
00:12:54,153 --> 00:12:55,948
and you're banging on
about raffle tickets!

210
00:12:56,048 --> 00:12:59,451
Don't be daft, Gramps,
it wasn't the moon, it couldn't be.

211
00:12:59,551 --> 00:13:02,540
I am telling you, it is getting worse,
these past few years.

212
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:04,135
It's like all of a sudden,

213
00:13:04,235 --> 00:13:07,498
they suddenly know all about us
and there's keen eyes up there

214
00:13:07,598 --> 00:13:09,672
and they're watching us,
and they're not friendly.

215
00:13:09,772 --> 00:13:11,325
This stapler says Bea.

216
00:13:11,425 --> 00:13:13,677
Can't believe how well you're taking
me getting sacked.

217
00:13:13,777 --> 00:13:14,921
Thought you'd hit the roof.

218
00:13:15,021 --> 00:13:16,072
I'm just tired, Donna.

219
00:13:16,172 --> 00:13:17,839
What with your father and everything.

220
00:13:18,683 --> 00:13:21,030
To be honest, I've given up on you.

221
00:13:21,130 --> 00:13:23,281
<i>This further report just in
from Oliver Morgenstern.</i>

222
00:13:23,381 --> 00:13:24,975
There was this woman
who took control.

223
00:13:25,075 --> 00:13:28,894
Said she knew what to do, said she
could stop the MRI or something.

224
00:13:28,994 --> 00:13:32,121
Sarah Jane, her name was.
Sarah Jane Smith.

225
00:13:32,293 --> 00:13:35,320
Sarah Jane Smith was
a freelance investigative journalist,

226
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:37,751
<i>formerly of Metropolitan Magazine.</i>

227
00:13:37,851 --> 00:13:41,270
<i>Her body was recovered from
the hospital late this afternoon...</i>

228
00:13:41,785 --> 00:13:44,390
- What's for tea?
- I've got nothing in.

229
00:13:45,310 --> 00:13:46,312
I'll get chips.

230
00:13:46,798 --> 00:13:49,850
Last of my wages.
Fish and chips, yeah?

231
00:13:49,950 --> 00:13:53,740
<i>Along with his teenage friends
Maria Jackson and Clyde Langer.</i>

232
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:56,293
<i>It is feared that they also perished.</i>

233
00:14:24,857 --> 00:14:26,831
Blimey, you all right?!

234
00:14:28,225 --> 00:14:31,142
- What was that, fireworks, or...?
- I dunno. I was just...

235
00:14:31,514 --> 00:14:33,137
walking along. That's weird!

236
00:14:35,568 --> 00:14:36,655
You're the one...

237
00:14:37,714 --> 00:14:39,550
Christmas Eve, I met you, in town.

238
00:14:40,155 --> 00:14:42,564
- Donna, isn't it?
- What was your name?

239
00:14:42,915 --> 00:14:44,495
How're you doing?
You're looking good.

240
00:14:44,681 --> 00:14:46,090
What you been up to?

241
00:14:46,562 --> 00:14:48,674
- You're doing it again.
- What?

242
00:14:49,153 --> 00:14:50,510
Looking behind me.

243
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,460
People keep on doing that.

244
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:55,088
- Looking at my back.
- What sort of people?

245
00:14:55,903 --> 00:14:57,050
People in the street.

246
00:14:57,355 --> 00:14:58,280
Strangers.

247
00:14:58,770 --> 00:15:00,282
I just catch them, sometimes.

248
00:15:00,382 --> 00:15:01,634
Staring at me.

249
00:15:02,556 --> 00:15:04,151
Like they're looking at something.

250
00:15:04,351 --> 00:15:07,649
And then I get home and
I look and there's nothing there.

251
00:15:10,381 --> 00:15:13,156
- See? Look, now I'M doing it!
- What are you doing for Christmas?

252
00:15:13,478 --> 00:15:14,686
What am I what?!

253
00:15:14,786 --> 00:15:16,996
Next Christmas. Any plans?

254
00:15:17,339 --> 00:15:18,884
I dunno, that's ages away!

255
00:15:18,984 --> 00:15:21,272
Nothing much, I suppose. Why?

256
00:15:22,109 --> 00:15:23,950
Just, I think you should get out,

257
00:15:24,219 --> 00:15:27,150
you and your family. Don't stay
in London. Just leave the city.

258
00:15:28,223 --> 00:15:29,146
What for?

259
00:15:29,246 --> 00:15:31,591
Nice hotel. Christmas break?

260
00:15:32,392 --> 00:15:33,222
Can't afford it.

261
00:15:33,322 --> 00:15:35,205
Well, now,
you've got that raffle ticket.

262
00:15:36,363 --> 00:15:38,437
- How d'you know about that?
- First prize.

263
00:15:39,488 --> 00:15:40,868
Luxury weekend break.

264
00:15:41,069 --> 00:15:43,030
Use it, Donna Noble.

265
00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:46,030
Why won't you tell me your name?

266
00:15:50,481 --> 00:15:52,441
I think you

267
00:15:53,091 --> 00:15:54,507
should leave me alone.

268
00:16:05,365 --> 00:16:09,141
# Merry Xmas Everybody #
by Slade

269
00:16:10,943 --> 00:16:13,790
<i>Cor blimey! That's what I call posh!</i>

270
00:16:14,050 --> 00:16:17,215
I said you were lucky!
Didn't I always say, my lucky star?

271
00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:21,821
For God's sake, don't tell them
that we won it in a raffle. Be classy!

272
00:16:21,921 --> 00:16:24,724
- Dad, take those things off.
- No, I shan't, it's Christmas!

273
00:16:24,824 --> 00:16:27,427
I'll have that one, thank you,
it's got my liniment in it.

274
00:16:27,527 --> 00:16:29,229
I reckon we deserve this.

275
00:16:30,059 --> 00:16:31,468
It's been a hell of a year.

276
00:16:31,568 --> 00:16:33,499
Your Dad would've loved this.

277
00:16:34,317 --> 00:16:34,981
Yeah.

278
00:16:36,057 --> 00:16:37,123
He would've.

279
00:16:45,547 --> 00:16:48,550
<i>Oy! Gramps!
Get that, that'll be breakfast!</i>

280
00:16:48,810 --> 00:16:50,230
We've got croissants!

281
00:16:50,591 --> 00:16:52,470
Why can't you get it? Lady Muck!

282
00:16:52,730 --> 00:16:55,032
It's Christmas Day,
I never get up before ten.

283
00:16:55,468 --> 00:16:58,015
Only madam there
was up with the dawn chorus.

284
00:16:58,115 --> 00:16:59,975
<i>Like when she was six years old!</i>

285
00:17:00,075 --> 00:17:02,385
I'm not wasting a second in this place!

286
00:17:03,128 --> 00:17:06,430
- How was the sofa?
- Oh, yeah, not so good, really.

287
00:17:09,666 --> 00:17:12,026
You know we could've paid
for a second room.

288
00:17:12,918 --> 00:17:13,637
Oi!

289
00:17:14,792 --> 00:17:17,195
- Merry Christmas!
- Merry Christmas.

290
00:17:17,295 --> 00:17:18,789
Merry Christmas, Dad.

291
00:17:19,049 --> 00:17:23,316
All right! All right, my darlin'!
Grub's up! Merry Christmas!

292
00:17:23,416 --> 00:17:24,433
Merry Christmas, sir.

293
00:17:25,842 --> 00:17:26,836
Have you seen this?

294
00:17:26,936 --> 00:17:28,910
Nice early breakfast,
then we'll go for a walk.

295
00:17:29,170 --> 00:17:30,734
People always say that at Christmas,

296
00:17:30,834 --> 00:17:33,308
"Oh, we all went for a walk"
I've always wanted to do that.

297
00:17:33,408 --> 00:17:36,450
So, walk first, presents later, yeah?

298
00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:37,544
Donna, come and see.

299
00:17:37,644 --> 00:17:39,490
Tienes algo en tu espalda.

300
00:17:39,769 --> 00:17:40,949
- What?
- Look at the telly.

301
00:17:41,049 --> 00:17:42,507
Tienes algo en tu espalda.

302
00:17:42,607 --> 00:17:44,639
What does it mean?
Don't know what you're saying.

303
00:17:44,739 --> 00:17:47,928
- Donna, look at the TV!
- Tienes algo en tu espalda!

304
00:17:55,392 --> 00:17:58,138
For God's sake, Donna,
don't just stand there, come and look!

305
00:17:59,011 --> 00:18:04,636
<i>This footage is live and genuine.
The object is falling on Central London.</i>

306
00:18:04,736 --> 00:18:08,033
I repeat, this is not a hoax.
A replica of the Titanic

307
00:18:08,133 --> 00:18:11,835
is falling out of the sky and
it's heading for Buckingham Palace.

308
00:18:12,264 --> 00:18:15,472
<i>We're getting this footage from
the Guinnevere range of satellites.</i>

309
00:18:15,795 --> 00:18:17,882
Is that... a film or something?

310
00:18:20,367 --> 00:18:22,977
<i>The Royal Air Force
has declared an emerg...</i>

311
00:18:33,401 --> 00:18:34,652
It's gone dead.

312
00:18:35,546 --> 00:18:36,312
All of them.

313
00:18:36,412 --> 00:18:39,425
No, but the Titanic?!
Oh, don't be daft!

314
00:18:40,883 --> 00:18:42,314
Is that like a sequel?

315
00:18:43,401 --> 00:18:44,070
Oh...

316
00:18:45,997 --> 00:18:47,937
Oh, God rest their souls.

317
00:18:53,923 --> 00:18:55,968
<i>I was supposed to be out there,
selling papers.</i>

318
00:18:56,068 --> 00:18:57,707
I should've been there.
We all should.

319
00:18:58,351 --> 00:18:59,480
We'd be dead.

320
00:19:00,392 --> 00:19:01,712
That's everyone.

321
00:19:02,527 --> 00:19:04,887
Every single person we know.

322
00:19:05,309 --> 00:19:06,539
The whole city.

323
00:19:07,955 --> 00:19:08,920
Can't be.

324
00:19:09,585 --> 00:19:11,065
But it is. It's gone.

325
00:19:12,188 --> 00:19:13,439
London's gone.

326
00:19:14,619 --> 00:19:16,710
If you hadn't won that raffle...

327
00:19:23,610 --> 00:19:26,661
Leeds?! I'm not moving to Leeds!

328
00:19:26,761 --> 00:19:28,091
I'm afraid it's Leeds,

329
00:19:28,191 --> 00:19:30,806
or you can wait in the hostel
for another three months.

330
00:19:30,906 --> 00:19:32,337
All I want is a washing machine.

331
00:19:32,437 --> 00:19:34,910
What about Glasgow,
I heard there was jobs going in Glasgow.

332
00:19:35,010 --> 00:19:36,127
You can't pick and choose!

333
00:19:36,227 --> 00:19:38,923
All of Southern England's
flooded with radiation,

334
00:19:39,023 --> 00:19:41,660
7 million people in need of relocation,

335
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:46,428
and now France has closed its borders,
so it's Leeds or nothing. Next!

336
00:19:59,350 --> 00:20:02,244
<i>The Daniels Family,
billetted at number 15.</i>

337
00:20:02,344 --> 00:20:05,483
Mr & Mrs Obego, billetted at number 31.

338
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:08,165
<i>Miss Coltrane, you're in number 8.</i>

339
00:20:08,265 --> 00:20:10,670
The Noble family,
billetted at number 29...

340
00:20:10,770 --> 00:20:12,710
That's us! Come on. Off we go.

341
00:20:13,924 --> 00:20:14,660
All right?

342
00:20:16,770 --> 00:20:19,346
Used to be a nice little family,
number 29.

343
00:20:19,446 --> 00:20:21,678
They missed one mortgage
payment, just one,

344
00:20:21,778 --> 00:20:24,159
they got booted out, all for you lot.

345
00:20:24,259 --> 00:20:26,920
Don't get all chippy
with me, Vera Duckworth.

346
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:29,708
Pop your clogs on and go
and feed t'whippets.

347
00:20:29,808 --> 00:20:30,773
Sweetheart, come on.

348
00:20:30,873 --> 00:20:34,005
You're not gonna make the
world any better by shouting at it.

349
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:36,008
I can try.

350
00:20:42,314 --> 00:20:44,152
What happens, do we get keys?

351
00:20:44,252 --> 00:20:47,027
- I don't know, do I?
- Who do we ask, the soldiers?

352
00:20:48,086 --> 00:20:50,744
Hey-ey! Is a big house!

353
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:54,220
Room for all! Welcome! In you come.

354
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:58,332
- I thought this was OUR house.
- Is many people's house! Is wonderful!

355
00:20:58,432 --> 00:20:59,660
In! In! In!

356
00:21:00,811 --> 00:21:02,735
<i>We've been here
for eight weeks already.</i>

357
00:21:02,835 --> 00:21:06,439
<i>I had a nice little paper shop
in Shepherd's Bush. All gone now.</i>

358
00:21:06,539 --> 00:21:10,257
So, upstairs, we have the
Merchandani family, seven of them,

359
00:21:10,357 --> 00:21:12,169
good family, good kids.

360
00:21:12,634 --> 00:21:15,301
Except that one, be careful of him.

361
00:21:15,959 --> 00:21:20,322
That's a joking! Where's that smile?

362
00:21:20,979 --> 00:21:24,212
Rocco Colosanto,
I'm here with my wife, and her sister,

363
00:21:24,312 --> 00:21:26,451
her husband, their kids,
and their daughter's kids.

364
00:21:26,551 --> 00:21:27,653
We've got the front room.

365
00:21:27,753 --> 00:21:31,415
My mother, she's got the back room.
She's old, you forgive.

366
00:21:31,808 --> 00:21:37,040
And this, this is you,
this is your palace!

367
00:21:40,026 --> 00:21:42,390
- What d'you mean, this is us?
- You live here!

368
00:21:43,329 --> 00:21:45,395
- We living in the kitchen?!
- You got camp beds!

369
00:21:45,495 --> 00:21:48,335
You got the cooker, you keep warm,
you got the fridge, you keep cool!

370
00:21:48,435 --> 00:21:50,231
- Is good!
- What about the bathroom?

371
00:21:50,331 --> 00:21:53,735
- Nobody lives in the bathroom!
- No, I mean, is there a rota?

372
00:21:53,835 --> 00:21:56,381
Is pot luck! Is fun!

373
00:21:56,603 --> 00:21:59,477
I go wake Mamma,
she likes new people.

374
00:21:59,577 --> 00:22:02,670
Mamma! Is people! Nice people!

375
00:22:05,142 --> 00:22:06,166
Ah, well...

376
00:22:07,110 --> 00:22:09,377
We'll settle in, won't we? Make do.

377
00:22:09,842 --> 00:22:11,809
Bit of wartime spirit, eh?

378
00:22:12,138 --> 00:22:14,938
But there isn't a war.
There's no fight,

379
00:22:15,889 --> 00:22:16,969
There's just...

380
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:18,694
this.

381
00:22:19,257 --> 00:22:20,798
Well, America, they'll save us.

382
00:22:20,898 --> 00:22:21,989
It was on the news.

383
00:22:22,089 --> 00:22:26,674
They're gonna send Great Britain
50 billion quid in financial aid!

384
00:22:27,115 --> 00:22:28,484
God bless America!

385
00:22:28,584 --> 00:22:32,940
America is in crisis with
over 60 million reported dead.

386
00:22:33,450 --> 00:22:38,026
Sixty million people have dissolved
into fat. And the fat is walking.

387
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:41,643
<i>People's fat has come to life
and is walking through the streets.</i>

388
00:22:42,179 --> 00:22:43,995
<i>And there are spaceships.</i>

389
00:22:44,095 --> 00:22:47,930
<i>There are reports of spaceships
over every major US city.</i>

390
00:22:48,030 --> 00:22:49,489
<i>The fat is flying...</i>

391
00:22:49,589 --> 00:22:50,590
Aliens.

392
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:52,598
Yeah.

393
00:22:52,764 --> 00:22:53,880
<i>...into the air.</i>

394
00:22:55,833 --> 00:22:59,179
Mary McGinty, d'you remember her?

395
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:00,896
Who was she?

396
00:23:01,310 --> 00:23:03,921
Worked in the newsagent on a Sunday.

397
00:23:04,877 --> 00:23:06,751
Little woman, black hair.

398
00:23:07,866 --> 00:23:09,354
Never really spoke to her.

399
00:23:09,897 --> 00:23:10,891
She'll be dead.

400
00:23:11,678 --> 00:23:13,559
<i>Every day, I think of someone else.</i>

401
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:15,143
<i>All dead.</i>

402
00:23:15,594 --> 00:23:17,460
Maybe she went away for Christmas.

403
00:23:17,946 --> 00:23:18,805
Maybe.

404
00:23:20,807 --> 00:23:24,025
I'll go out tomorrow,
I'll walk into town.

405
00:23:24,569 --> 00:23:25,837
There's got to be work.

406
00:23:26,115 --> 00:23:27,989
Everyone needs secretaries.

407
00:23:28,382 --> 00:23:31,270
Soon as I'm earning,
we'll get a proper place.

408
00:23:31,872 --> 00:23:33,102
Just you wait, Mum.

409
00:23:33,703 --> 00:23:35,230
What if it never gets better?

410
00:23:35,701 --> 00:23:36,910
Course it will.

411
00:23:37,253 --> 00:23:38,826
<i>Even the bees are disappearing.</i>

412
00:23:38,926 --> 00:23:40,914
You don't see bumble bees any more.

413
00:23:41,072 --> 00:23:42,330
They'll sort us out,

414
00:23:43,775 --> 00:23:45,064
the Emergency Government.

415
00:23:45,944 --> 00:23:47,975
- They'll do something.
- What if they don't?

416
00:23:49,498 --> 00:23:50,513
Then...

417
00:23:51,808 --> 00:23:53,009
we'll complain.

418
00:23:53,109 --> 00:23:54,470
Who's gonna listen to us?

419
00:23:55,021 --> 00:23:56,344
Refugees.

420
00:23:57,009 --> 00:23:58,540
We haven't even got a vote.

421
00:23:59,315 --> 00:24:00,935
We're just no-one, Donna.

422
00:24:01,715 --> 00:24:03,174
We don't exist.

423
00:24:03,789 --> 00:24:06,965
# ..And I spent all my
money on whisky and beer.. #

424
00:24:07,065 --> 00:24:10,090
I am going to kill that man!

425
00:24:12,772 --> 00:24:15,100
Now, listen, Mussolini!

426
00:24:16,115 --> 00:24:19,882
I am telling you, for the last time,
to button it!

427
00:24:20,218 --> 00:24:23,302
If I hear one more sea shanty...

428
00:24:26,530 --> 00:24:28,990
Always loved a sing-song.

429
00:24:29,438 --> 00:24:32,293
# ..I'm just a poor boy,
nobody loves me

430
00:24:32,393 --> 00:24:35,239
# He's just a poor boy
from a poor family

431
00:24:35,339 --> 00:24:38,229
# Spare him his life
from this monstrosity

432
00:24:39,673 --> 00:24:40,970
# Easy come, easy go

433
00:24:41,070 --> 00:24:43,200
# Will you let me go...? #

434
00:24:46,004 --> 00:24:47,885
You stay here!

435
00:24:48,728 --> 00:24:49,830
Everyone, stay!

436
00:24:52,607 --> 00:24:55,475
Hey! Firing at the car, is not so good!

437
00:24:55,575 --> 00:24:57,206
You crazy or what?!

438
00:24:57,370 --> 00:24:58,937
It's this ATMOS thing, it won't stop,

439
00:24:59,037 --> 00:25:00,145
it's like gas, it's toxic.

440
00:25:00,245 --> 00:25:01,294
Well, switch it off!

441
00:25:01,394 --> 00:25:03,647
I have done! It's still going!
It's all the cars,

442
00:25:03,747 --> 00:25:06,343
every single ATMOS car!
They've gone mad...

443
00:25:08,531 --> 00:25:10,190
You... lady, turn round.

444
00:25:10,571 --> 00:25:12,080
- Turn around!
- Are you crazy, boy?

445
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:12,580
Now!

446
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:14,862
- Put that down!
- Turn round!

447
00:25:15,930 --> 00:25:16,964
Do what he says!

448
00:25:17,090 --> 00:25:18,802
Show me your back! Turn around!

449
00:25:19,581 --> 00:25:20,904
<i>Show me your back!</i>

450
00:25:26,568 --> 00:25:27,164
Sorry.

451
00:25:27,544 --> 00:25:28,502
I thought I saw...

452
00:25:28,602 --> 00:25:32,659
Call yourself a soldier?!
Pointing guns at innocent women!

453
00:25:32,759 --> 00:25:33,940
<i>You're a disgrace!</i>

454
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:36,350
<i>In my day, we'd have
had you court-martialled!</i>

455
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:40,489
Donna, where are you going?
It's not safe at night!

456
00:25:40,696 --> 00:25:42,710
Donna! Donna!

457
00:25:47,656 --> 00:25:48,285
Hello.

458
00:25:50,061 --> 00:25:50,743
Hi.

459
00:25:51,439 --> 00:25:53,091
It's the ATMOS devices.

460
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:56,974
We're lucky, it's not so bad here,
Britain hasn't got that much petrol.

461
00:25:57,074 --> 00:25:58,450
But all over Europe...

462
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:01,432
China, South Africa...

463
00:26:02,033 --> 00:26:03,900
They're getting choked by gas.

464
00:26:04,794 --> 00:26:06,152
Can't anyone stop it?

465
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:08,343
Yeah, they're trying right now.

466
00:26:08,443 --> 00:26:12,198
This little band of fighters,
on board the Sontaran ship.

467
00:26:13,714 --> 00:26:15,165
Any second now.

468
00:26:30,196 --> 00:26:31,476
And that was...?

469
00:26:32,258 --> 00:26:33,591
That was the Torchwood team.

470
00:26:34,348 --> 00:26:35,624
Gwen Cooper,

471
00:26:35,995 --> 00:26:38,008
Ianto Jones, they gave their lives.

472
00:26:38,929 --> 00:26:42,489
And Captain Jack Harkness has
transported to the Sontaran homeworld.

473
00:26:42,708 --> 00:26:43,880
There's no-one left.

474
00:26:46,912 --> 00:26:48,701
You're always wearing
the same clothes.

475
00:26:49,340 --> 00:26:51,116
Why won't you tell me your name?

476
00:26:51,216 --> 00:26:53,794
None of this was meant to happen.

477
00:26:55,082 --> 00:26:56,115
There was a man.

478
00:26:57,335 --> 00:27:00,008
This wonderful man.
And he stopped it.

479
00:27:00,227 --> 00:27:04,388
The Titanic, the Adipose, the ATMOS,
he stopped them all from happening.

480
00:27:04,582 --> 00:27:06,150
That... Doctor?

481
00:27:06,865 --> 00:27:08,712
- You knew him.
- Did I?

482
00:27:10,118 --> 00:27:10,664
When?

483
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:14,287
I think you dream about him sometimes.
It's a man in a suit.

484
00:27:14,531 --> 00:27:17,384
Tall, thin man. Great hair.

485
00:27:18,041 --> 00:27:20,475
Some really great hair.

486
00:27:21,607 --> 00:27:22,833
Who are you?

487
00:27:23,209 --> 00:27:25,624
I was like you. I used to be you.

488
00:27:25,775 --> 00:27:27,470
Cos you travelled with him, Donna,

489
00:27:27,632 --> 00:27:29,736
you travelled with the Doctor
in a different world.

490
00:27:29,836 --> 00:27:32,026
I never met him. And he's dead.

491
00:27:32,126 --> 00:27:33,654
He died underneath the Thames

492
00:27:33,754 --> 00:27:35,762
on Christmas Eve.
But you were meant to be there.

493
00:27:35,862 --> 00:27:38,815
He needed someone to stop him,
and that was you. You made him leave.

494
00:27:39,372 --> 00:27:40,611
You saved his life.

495
00:27:48,695 --> 00:27:51,410
Doctor! You can stop now!

496
00:27:52,650 --> 00:27:55,295
Stop it! I don't know what you're
talking about, leave me alone!

497
00:27:55,395 --> 00:27:58,026
Something's coming, Donna.
Something worse.

498
00:27:58,315 --> 00:28:00,827
The whole world is stinking.

499
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:03,605
How could anything be worse than this?

500
00:28:03,705 --> 00:28:06,470
Trust me. We need the Doctor
more than ever. I've...

501
00:28:07,392 --> 00:28:09,833
I've been pulled across
from a different universe,

502
00:28:09,933 --> 00:28:11,915
because every single
universe is in danger.

503
00:28:12,247 --> 00:28:13,790
It's coming, Donna.

504
00:28:14,050 --> 00:28:17,493
<i>It's coming from across the stars,
and nothing can stop it.</i>

505
00:28:17,593 --> 00:28:18,670
What is?

506
00:28:19,696 --> 00:28:20,803
The darkness.

507
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:27,335
Well, what d'you keep telling me for?
What am I supposed to do?!

508
00:28:27,754 --> 00:28:28,880
I'm nothing special.

509
00:28:29,124 --> 00:28:33,289
I mean... I'm not...
I'm nothing special. I'm a temp!

510
00:28:33,687 --> 00:28:35,950
I'm not even that! I'm nothing.

511
00:28:36,102 --> 00:28:40,190
Donna Noble, you're the most important
woman in the whole of creation.

512
00:28:41,714 --> 00:28:42,815
Oh, don't.

513
00:28:43,808 --> 00:28:46,027
Just... don't.

514
00:28:48,054 --> 00:28:49,190
I'm tired.

515
00:28:50,717 --> 00:28:53,201
I'm so tired.

516
00:28:55,088 --> 00:28:56,740
I need you to come with me.

517
00:28:57,584 --> 00:28:59,380
Yeah, well,

518
00:29:00,412 --> 00:29:03,392
blonde hair might work on the men,
but you ain't shifting me, lady!

519
00:29:03,492 --> 00:29:04,744
That's more like it.

520
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:08,166
- I've got plenty more.
- You'll come with me.

521
00:29:09,361 --> 00:29:10,687
Only when you want to.

522
00:29:11,185 --> 00:29:12,392
You'll have a long wait, then.

523
00:29:12,492 --> 00:29:13,531
Not really, just 3 weeks.

524
00:29:13,631 --> 00:29:16,215
Tell me, does your grandfather
still own that telescope?

525
00:29:18,793 --> 00:29:20,025
He never lets go of it.

526
00:29:20,463 --> 00:29:21,628
Three weeks' time.

527
00:29:23,211 --> 00:29:24,681
But you've got to be certain.

528
00:29:25,026 --> 00:29:27,366
Cos when you come with me,
Donna... I'm sorry,

529
00:29:28,166 --> 00:29:29,299
so sorry, but...

530
00:29:31,566 --> 00:29:32,886
you're going to die.

531
00:29:50,395 --> 00:29:53,017
And you! I'll gonna
miss you most of all!

532
00:29:53,117 --> 00:29:55,230
All flame-haired and fiery!

533
00:29:55,952 --> 00:29:58,105
Oh, but why d'you have to go?

534
00:29:58,261 --> 00:30:01,397
It's the new law!
England for the English, et cetera.

535
00:30:01,647 --> 00:30:03,793
They can't send us home,
the oceans are closed,

536
00:30:03,893 --> 00:30:05,051
they build labour camps!

537
00:30:05,151 --> 00:30:08,260
I know, but labour doing what?
There aren't any jobs.

538
00:30:09,025 --> 00:30:11,950
Sewing, digging, is good!

539
00:30:12,210 --> 00:30:15,795
Now, stop it
before I kiss you too much...

540
00:30:17,815 --> 00:30:18,706
Wilfred!

541
00:30:19,725 --> 00:30:20,770
My capitano!

542
00:30:36,548 --> 00:30:38,162
<i>It'll be quiet with him gone.</i>

543
00:30:38,682 --> 00:30:40,550
<i>Still, we'll have more room.</i>

544
00:30:40,955 --> 00:30:41,941
Labour camps.

545
00:30:42,923 --> 00:30:44,769
That's what they called them last time.

546
00:30:45,332 --> 00:30:46,310
What d'you mean?

547
00:30:51,442 --> 00:30:52,550
It's happening again.

548
00:30:53,369 --> 00:30:54,157
What is?

549
00:31:00,402 --> 00:31:01,128
'Scuse me!

550
00:31:01,597 --> 00:31:03,161
'Scuse me, where
are you taking them?

551
00:31:03,812 --> 00:31:05,038
Where are you going?

552
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:07,103
Where are you going?

553
00:31:07,478 --> 00:31:09,124
Where are you going?!

554
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:12,360
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?!

555
00:31:30,636 --> 00:31:31,919
I asked about jobs.

556
00:31:32,645 --> 00:31:33,615
With the army.

557
00:31:34,459 --> 00:31:36,040
They said I wasn't qualified.

558
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:43,905
You were right. You said I should
have worked harder at school.

559
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:51,867
Suppose I've always
been a disappointment.

560
00:31:52,793 --> 00:31:53,506
Yeah.

561
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:11,493
You know we'd get a bit of cash
if we sold this thing.

562
00:32:11,812 --> 00:32:12,913
Don't you dare.

563
00:32:14,452 --> 00:32:19,504
I always imagined, your old age...
I'd have put a bit of money by.

564
00:32:19,949 --> 00:32:21,123
Make you comfy.

565
00:32:22,362 --> 00:32:23,275
Never did.

566
00:32:24,264 --> 00:32:25,397
I'm just useless.

567
00:32:29,382 --> 00:32:31,470
You're supposed to say,
"No, you're not."

568
00:32:32,679 --> 00:32:34,350
Ah, it must be the alignment...

569
00:32:34,450 --> 00:32:35,025
What's wrong?

570
00:32:35,125 --> 00:32:38,498
Well, I dunno, I mean it can't be
the lens cos I was looking at Orion,

571
00:32:38,598 --> 00:32:40,513
the constellation of Orion.

572
00:32:40,613 --> 00:32:43,647
You take a look.
Now, tell me, what can you see?

573
00:32:43,747 --> 00:32:46,200
- Where?
- Well, up there, in the sky!

574
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:50,780
Well, I can't see anything.
It's just black.

575
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:53,613
Well, I mean it's working.
The telescope is working.

576
00:32:53,713 --> 00:32:54,395
Well...

577
00:32:54,933 --> 00:32:57,054
- maybe it's the clouds.
- There's no clouds.

578
00:32:57,154 --> 00:32:59,025
- Well, there must be!
- There's not!

579
00:32:59,125 --> 00:33:03,408
It was there, an entire constellation.

580
00:33:05,929 --> 00:33:06,630
<i>Look!</i>

581
00:33:08,058 --> 00:33:08,758
Look there.

582
00:33:11,058 --> 00:33:11,984
<i>They're going out.</i>

583
00:33:13,085 --> 00:33:14,142
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

584
00:33:14,899 --> 00:33:17,710
Donna, the stars are going out.

585
00:33:26,221 --> 00:33:27,510
I'm ready.

586
00:33:45,499 --> 00:33:48,346
<i>Loadstone testing now at 15.4,</i>

587
00:33:48,446 --> 00:33:50,298
<i>repeat 15.4.</i>

588
00:33:53,234 --> 00:33:55,473
- Ma'am.
- I've told you, don't salute.

589
00:33:55,573 --> 00:33:57,713
Well, if you're not going
to tell us your name...

590
00:33:57,963 --> 00:33:59,142
What, you don't know either?

591
00:33:59,242 --> 00:34:01,983
I've crossed too many different
realities. Trust me, the wrong word

592
00:34:02,083 --> 00:34:05,630
in the wrong place can change
an entire causal nexus.

593
00:34:05,730 --> 00:34:07,840
She talks like that. A lot.

594
00:34:08,653 --> 00:34:10,887
And you must be... Miss Noble.

595
00:34:11,375 --> 00:34:12,138
Donna.

596
00:34:12,576 --> 00:34:14,960
Captain Erisa Magambo.
Thank you for this.

597
00:34:15,248 --> 00:34:17,331
- I don't even know what I'm doing.
- Is it awake?

598
00:34:17,431 --> 00:34:19,975
Seems to be quiet, today.
Ticking over.

599
00:34:20,447 --> 00:34:21,661
<i>Like it's waiting.</i>

600
00:34:22,649 --> 00:34:23,880
D'you want to see it?

601
00:34:25,859 --> 00:34:27,286
What's a "police box"?

602
00:34:27,386 --> 00:34:29,926
They salvaged it from underneath
the Thames. Just go inside.

603
00:34:30,026 --> 00:34:31,984
- What for?
- Just go in.

604
00:34:50,348 --> 00:34:52,094
<i>No way!</i>

605
00:35:23,897 --> 00:35:24,923
What d'you think?

606
00:35:28,089 --> 00:35:29,096
Can I have a coffee?

607
00:35:29,196 --> 00:35:31,309
Time And Relative Dimension in Space.

608
00:35:32,697 --> 00:35:34,180
This room used to shine with light.

609
00:35:34,887 --> 00:35:36,000
I think it's dying.

610
00:35:41,852 --> 00:35:43,270
It's still trying to help.

611
00:35:44,255 --> 00:35:46,638
And... it belonged to the Doctor?

612
00:35:46,738 --> 00:35:49,498
He was a Time Lord. Last of his kind.

613
00:35:49,773 --> 00:35:51,522
But if he was so special,

614
00:35:52,717 --> 00:35:53,880
what was he doing with me?

615
00:35:54,181 --> 00:35:55,420
He thought you were brilliant.

616
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,403
- Don't be stupid.
- But you are.

617
00:35:57,503 --> 00:36:00,443
It just took the Doctor to show you
that, simply by being with him.

618
00:36:00,963 --> 00:36:03,947
He did the same to me,
to everyone he touches.

619
00:36:06,594 --> 00:36:07,983
Were you and him...?

620
00:36:18,221 --> 00:36:19,870
- D'you want to see it?
- No.

621
00:36:24,349 --> 00:36:25,072
Go on, then.

622
00:36:25,250 --> 00:36:27,003
We don't know how the TARDIS works,

623
00:36:27,103 --> 00:36:29,427
but we've managed to scrape off
the surface technology,

624
00:36:29,527 --> 00:36:31,150
enough to show you the creature.

625
00:36:32,405 --> 00:36:33,339
It's a creature?

626
00:36:33,664 --> 00:36:34,678
Just stand here.

627
00:36:34,941 --> 00:36:36,280
Out of the circle, please.

628
00:36:37,956 --> 00:36:39,020
Yes, ma'am.

629
00:36:40,228 --> 00:36:41,535
Can't you stay with me?

630
00:36:42,912 --> 00:36:43,885
Ready?

631
00:36:44,499 --> 00:36:46,745
And... activate.

632
00:36:53,571 --> 00:36:56,055
- Open your eyes, Donna.
- Is it there?

633
00:36:56,155 --> 00:36:57,820
Open your eyes. Look at it.

634
00:36:59,115 --> 00:37:01,474
- I can't.
- It's part of you, Donna. Look.

635
00:37:11,288 --> 00:37:15,590
It's OK, it's OK, it's OK, calm down!
Donna, Donna, Donna! OK.

636
00:37:27,229 --> 00:37:27,924
What is it?

637
00:37:28,493 --> 00:37:29,588
We don't know.

638
00:37:29,951 --> 00:37:32,366
Oh... thanks!

639
00:37:32,770 --> 00:37:34,078
It feeds off time.

640
00:37:34,672 --> 00:37:37,594
By changing time, by making
someone's life take a different turn,

641
00:37:37,694 --> 00:37:40,817
like, er, meetings never made,

642
00:37:41,819 --> 00:37:43,326
<i>children never born, </i>

643
00:37:43,695 --> 00:37:44,937
a life never loved.

644
00:37:46,351 --> 00:37:49,404
- But with you it's...
- I never did anything important.

645
00:37:49,504 --> 00:37:53,008
Yes, you did. One day, that thing
made you turn right, instead of left.

646
00:37:53,108 --> 00:37:55,055
- When was that?
- You wouldn't remember.

647
00:37:55,155 --> 00:37:57,890
It was the most ordinary day
in the world. But by turning right,

648
00:37:58,159 --> 00:38:02,107
you never met the Doctor. And the whole
world just changed around you.

649
00:38:02,635 --> 00:38:04,230
Can you get rid of it?

650
00:38:04,490 --> 00:38:06,317
No, I can't even touch it.

651
00:38:07,349 --> 00:38:09,061
Seems to be in a state of flux.

652
00:38:09,787 --> 00:38:12,221
What does that mean?

653
00:38:12,559 --> 00:38:13,472
I don't know.

654
00:38:14,073 --> 00:38:15,913
Sort of thing the Doctor would say.

655
00:38:16,013 --> 00:38:17,032
You liar!

656
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:20,774
You told me I was special.

657
00:38:21,481 --> 00:38:25,385
But it's not me,
it's this thing, I'm just a host!

658
00:38:25,554 --> 00:38:27,562
No, there's more than that...

659
00:38:28,075 --> 00:38:29,459
The readings are strange.

660
00:38:29,997 --> 00:38:32,312
It's like reality is just
bending around you.

661
00:38:32,412 --> 00:38:34,302
Because of this thing!

662
00:38:34,402 --> 00:38:36,729
No, no, we're getting
separate readings from you.

663
00:38:36,953 --> 00:38:39,455
And they've always been there,
since the day you were born.

664
00:38:39,555 --> 00:38:41,745
This is not relevant to the mission.

665
00:38:42,283 --> 00:38:44,235
I thought it was just
the Doctor we needed,

666
00:38:45,068 --> 00:38:48,604
but it's the both of you.
The Doctor and Donna Noble. Together.

667
00:38:49,305 --> 00:38:51,032
To stop the stars from going out.

668
00:38:51,915 --> 00:38:52,777
Why?

669
00:38:54,338 --> 00:38:56,470
What can I do?

670
00:39:02,603 --> 00:39:03,800
Turn it off!

671
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:05,946
Please.

672
00:39:06,190 --> 00:39:07,785
- Captain.
- Power down.

673
00:39:16,634 --> 00:39:18,868
It's still there, though.

674
00:39:21,164 --> 00:39:22,103
What can I do...

675
00:39:23,176 --> 00:39:24,396
to get rid of it?

676
00:39:25,591 --> 00:39:27,070
You're going to travel in time!

677
00:39:27,330 --> 00:39:30,371
The TARDIS has tracked down the moment
of intervention, Monday the 25th,

678
00:39:30,471 --> 00:39:31,735
10:01 in the morning.

679
00:39:31,835 --> 00:39:35,030
Your car was on Little Sutton, leading
to Ealing Road, but you turned right,

680
00:39:35,130 --> 00:39:36,335
heading for Griffin's Parade.

681
00:39:36,435 --> 00:39:39,038
You need to turn left.
You've got to go back,

682
00:39:39,138 --> 00:39:40,350
turn left. Got that, Donna?

683
00:39:40,450 --> 00:39:44,015
At 10:01, make yourself turn left,
heading for the Chiswick High Road.

684
00:39:44,115 --> 00:39:47,298
Keep the jacket on at all times it's
insulation against temporal feedback.

685
00:39:47,398 --> 00:39:49,788
This will correspond to
local time wherever you land.

686
00:39:49,888 --> 00:39:52,030
This is to combat dehydration.

687
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:02,997
This is where we leave you.

688
00:40:03,097 --> 00:40:04,736
Don't want to see that thing on my back.

689
00:40:04,836 --> 00:40:06,813
No, the mirrors are just incidental.

690
00:40:06,913 --> 00:40:08,955
<i>They bounce chronon
energy back into the centre,</i>

691
00:40:09,055 --> 00:40:11,908
which we control
and decide the destination.

692
00:40:12,271 --> 00:40:13,728
It's a time machine.

693
00:40:14,279 --> 00:40:15,737
It's a time machine.

694
00:40:16,056 --> 00:40:17,032
If you could...

695
00:40:23,632 --> 00:40:24,708
Powering up!

696
00:40:30,252 --> 00:40:32,536
- How d'you know it's gonna work?
- Hmm?

697
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:37,630
Oh, we... we don't.
We're... we're just guessing.

698
00:40:40,073 --> 00:40:41,287
Brilliant!

699
00:40:41,387 --> 00:40:43,239
<i>Just remember,
when you get to the junction,</i>

700
00:40:43,339 --> 00:40:45,967
change the car's direction
by one minute past ten.

701
00:40:46,090 --> 00:40:48,150
- How do I do that?
- It's up to you.

702
00:40:48,545 --> 00:40:51,381
Well... I'll just have to...

703
00:40:51,825 --> 00:40:55,028
run up to myself and...
have a good argument.

704
00:40:55,403 --> 00:40:58,213
- I'd like to see that.
- Activate lodestone.

705
00:41:01,226 --> 00:41:02,121
Good luck.

706
00:41:02,891 --> 00:41:04,950
- I'm ready!
- One minute past ten.

707
00:41:05,437 --> 00:41:07,039
Cos I understand now!

708
00:41:07,752 --> 00:41:09,404
You said I was gonna die, but...

709
00:41:09,704 --> 00:41:14,190
you mean this whole world,
it's gonna blink out of existence...

710
00:41:14,675 --> 00:41:18,488
but that's not dying,
cos a better world takes its place.

711
00:41:19,076 --> 00:41:20,119
The Doctor's world!

712
00:41:21,014 --> 00:41:22,271
<i>And I'm still alive!</i>

713
00:41:24,411 --> 00:41:27,395
That's right, isn't it?
I don't die. If I change things,

714
00:41:27,495 --> 00:41:31,044
I don't die. That's...
that's right, isn't it?

715
00:41:35,336 --> 00:41:36,190
I'm sorry.

716
00:41:36,950 --> 00:41:38,310
But I can't die!

717
00:41:39,922 --> 00:41:41,270
<i>I've got a future!</i>

718
00:41:42,306 --> 00:41:44,670
With the Doctor, you told me!

719
00:41:45,810 --> 00:41:46,823
Activate!

720
00:42:21,691 --> 00:42:22,340
But...

721
00:42:23,135 --> 00:42:25,156
Hold on... But this is...

722
00:42:26,019 --> 00:42:26,920
I'm not...

723
00:42:28,572 --> 00:42:29,961
This is Sutton Court!

724
00:42:31,453 --> 00:42:34,975
I'm half a mile away!
I'M HALF A MILE AWAY!

725
00:42:38,330 --> 00:42:39,536
Four minutes.

726
00:42:40,994 --> 00:42:41,995
Oh, my God!

727
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:47,939
Jival Chowdry,

728
00:42:49,109 --> 00:42:52,032
he runs that little photocopy
business in Merchant Street

729
00:42:52,132 --> 00:42:53,797
and he needs a secretary.

730
00:42:53,966 --> 00:42:55,580
I've got a job!

731
00:43:03,660 --> 00:43:08,371
HC Clements is in the city.
It's nice, it's posh,

732
00:43:08,555 --> 00:43:09,927
so stop it!

733
00:43:20,141 --> 00:43:22,600
It won't take long,
just turn right.

734
00:43:25,027 --> 00:43:27,470
I'm going left, if you don't like it,
get out and walk!

735
00:43:29,835 --> 00:43:31,234
You think I'm so useless.

736
00:43:31,334 --> 00:43:34,546
Oh, I know why you want
a job with HC Clements, lady.

737
00:43:34,646 --> 00:43:36,410
Cos you think you'll meet a man.

738
00:43:43,770 --> 00:43:45,200
I'm not gonna get there.

739
00:43:50,668 --> 00:43:51,800
You're gonna die.

740
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:02,825
City executives don't need
temps, except for practice.

741
00:44:04,267 --> 00:44:04,880
Yeah.

742
00:44:05,793 --> 00:44:07,150
Suppose you're right.

743
00:44:12,247 --> 00:44:13,030
Please.

744
00:44:20,416 --> 00:44:22,070
Can you hear that?

745
00:44:22,806 --> 00:44:25,565
- Oh, no! Go back!
- Oi! Get a move on!

746
00:44:27,486 --> 00:44:30,568
- The traffic's stopping.
- Something must've happened.

747
00:44:40,487 --> 00:44:41,532
Tell him this.

748
00:44:42,658 --> 00:44:43,791
Two words.

749
00:44:54,779 --> 00:44:57,415
Well, that decides it.
I'm not sitting in a traffic jam.

750
00:44:57,634 --> 00:44:59,164
<i>I'm going left! I'm going left!</i>

751
00:44:59,264 --> 00:45:00,490
<i>Left... left... left...</i>

752
00:45:05,050 --> 00:45:06,030
<i>Left...</i>

753
00:45:06,202 --> 00:45:07,870
<i>Left... left...</i>

754
00:45:20,794 --> 00:45:22,790
What the hell is that?!

755
00:45:22,890 --> 00:45:24,648
You were so strong.

756
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:27,426
What are you?

757
00:45:28,095 --> 00:45:29,875
What will you be?

758
00:45:31,401 --> 00:45:32,853
<i>What will you be?</i>

759
00:45:36,062 --> 00:45:37,088
Everything all right?

760
00:45:38,027 --> 00:45:39,124
Oh, God...!

761
00:45:41,595 --> 00:45:42,965
What was that for?!

762
00:45:43,903 --> 00:45:44,998
I don't know!

763
00:45:52,714 --> 00:45:54,003
<i>Can't remember.</i>

764
00:45:55,260 --> 00:45:56,500
It's slipping away.

765
00:45:58,032 --> 00:46:01,110
You know, like when you think
of a dream, and it sort of goes.

766
00:46:01,767 --> 00:46:02,962
Just got lucky, this thing.

767
00:46:03,212 --> 00:46:04,783
It's one of the Trickster's Brigade.

768
00:46:05,859 --> 00:46:07,817
Changes a life in tiny little ways.

769
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:11,075
Most times, the universe just
compensates around it, but with you...

770
00:46:11,663 --> 00:46:13,796
great big parallel world!

771
00:46:14,916 --> 00:46:17,738
Hold on, you said
parallel worlds are sealed off.

772
00:46:17,995 --> 00:46:18,760
They are.

773
00:46:19,023 --> 00:46:20,710
But you had one created around you.

774
00:46:21,763 --> 00:46:24,870
Funny thing is...
seems to be happening a lot. To you.

775
00:46:25,811 --> 00:46:26,681
How d'you mean?

776
00:46:26,781 --> 00:46:28,741
Well, the Library. Then this.

777
00:46:29,542 --> 00:46:32,920
Just goes with the job, I suppose.

778
00:46:33,233 --> 00:46:36,261
Sometimes I think there's way
too much coincidence around you, Donna.

779
00:46:36,568 --> 00:46:39,615
I met you once. Then I met
your grandfather. Then I met you again.

780
00:46:39,825 --> 00:46:42,828
In the whole wide universe,
I met you for a second time.

781
00:46:44,223 --> 00:46:46,225
It's like something's
binding us together.

782
00:46:47,495 --> 00:46:49,973
Don't be so daft.
I'm nothing special.

783
00:46:50,073 --> 00:46:51,818
Yes, you are, you're brilliant.

784
00:46:53,283 --> 00:46:54,515
He thought you were brilliant.

785
00:46:56,749 --> 00:46:57,768
SHE said that.

786
00:46:58,940 --> 00:46:59,672
Who did?

787
00:46:59,991 --> 00:47:00,773
That woman.

788
00:47:01,786 --> 00:47:03,063
I can't remember...

789
00:47:03,163 --> 00:47:04,658
She never existed, now.

790
00:47:05,102 --> 00:47:06,191
No, but she said...

791
00:47:06,717 --> 00:47:07,670
<i>The stars...</i>

792
00:47:10,379 --> 00:47:11,993
She said the stars are going out.

793
00:47:12,093 --> 00:47:15,270
- Yeah, but that world's gone.
- No, but she said it was all worlds.

794
00:47:15,597 --> 00:47:16,698
Every world.

795
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:19,815
She said the darkness is coming.

796
00:47:20,284 --> 00:47:21,950
- Even here.
- Who was she?

797
00:47:22,293 --> 00:47:24,633
- I don't know.
- What did she look like?

798
00:47:25,609 --> 00:47:26,403
She was...

799
00:47:27,964 --> 00:47:28,780
blonde.

800
00:47:28,979 --> 00:47:29,836
What was her name?

801
00:47:29,936 --> 00:47:31,840
- I don't know.
- Donna, what was her name?

802
00:47:34,460 --> 00:47:35,470
But she told me...

803
00:47:35,974 --> 00:47:36,937
<i>to warn you.</i>

804
00:47:37,594 --> 00:47:39,380
She said... two words.

805
00:47:39,531 --> 00:47:41,640
What two words? What were they?
What did she say?

806
00:47:47,658 --> 00:47:48,741
"Bad Wolf."

807
00:47:51,195 --> 00:47:52,320
What does it mean?

808
00:48:14,832 --> 00:48:16,090
Doctor, what is it?

809
00:48:16,709 --> 00:48:18,067
What's Bad Wolf?

810
00:48:19,300 --> 00:48:21,209
It's the end of the universe.

811
00:48:34,821 --> 00:48:37,217
Ladies and gentlemen, we are at war.

812
00:48:37,410 --> 00:48:39,670
- It can't be.
- There's nothing I can do.

813
00:48:39,825 --> 00:48:42,815
- Oh, my God!
- What is it, who are they?

814
00:48:43,066 --> 00:48:44,348
What are we going to do?

815
00:48:45,168 --> 00:48:46,270
It's impossible.

816
00:48:46,691 --> 00:48:47,974
It can't be!

817
00:48:48,343 --> 00:48:49,888
I'm sorry, we're dead.

818
00:48:49,988 --> 00:48:51,252
Doctor, come back!

819
00:48:52,929 --> 00:48:54,487
It's only just beginning.

820
00:49:20,911 --> 00:49:24,320
