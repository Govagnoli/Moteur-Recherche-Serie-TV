1
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:15,680
There we go. Perfect landing. Which
isn't easy in such a tight spot.

2
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:17,980
You should be used
to tight spots by now!

3
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:24,320
Where are we? The end of the line.

4
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,040
No place like it.

5
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:34,880
Home?

6
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:37,760
You took me home.
Back to the morning after we left.

7
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:40,060
So you've only been gone about
twelve hours. No time at all, really!

8
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:44,480
But all the stuff we've done...
Shakespeare, New New York,
Old New York!

9
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:46,200
Yep. All in one night.

10
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:49,850
Relatively speaking. Everything
should be just as it was. Books,
CDs...

11
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:51,510
Laundry.

12
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:56,380
So, back where you were. As promised.

13
00:00:56,380 --> 00:00:59,070
This is it?

14
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:01,560
Yeah, I should probably, um...

15
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:06,560
PHONE RINGS
'Hi, I'm out. Leave a message.'
I'm sorry.

16
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:09,050
Martha? Are you there?
Pick it up, will you?

17
00:01:09,050 --> 00:01:10,780
It's Mum. It'll wait.

18
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:13,280
All right then. Pretend
that you're out, if you like.

19
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:16,540
I was only calling to say
that your sister's on TV.

20
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:19,800
On the news, of all things! Just
thought you might be interested.

21
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:21,340
The details are top secret.

22
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:23,260
How could Tish end up on the news?

23
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:27,100
But I can tell you that, tonight,
I will demonstrate a device...

24
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:29,480
She's got a new job.
PR for some research lab.

25
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:32,860
With the push of a single button,

26
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:35,550
I will change what it means

27
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:37,280
to be human!

28
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,310
Sorry. You were saying...

29
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:43,610
You should?

30
00:01:43,610 --> 00:01:46,300
Yes, yes. I should.

31
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:50,720
One trip is what we said. Yeah.

32
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:55,520
I suppose things just,
kind of, escalated. Mmm.

33
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,130
Seems to happen to me a lot.

34
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,890
Thank you.

35
00:02:00,890 --> 00:02:03,770
For everything.

36
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:05,000
It was my pleasure.

37
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:19,130
TARDIS WHIRRS

38
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:35,840
TARDIS WHIRRS

39
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:41,980
No, I'm sorry.

40
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:45,630
Did he say he was going to
change what it means to be human?

41
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:25,760
Are you sure it's safe? There were
some issues. They've been resolved.

42
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:29,210
I'm confident
I'm in no serious danger.

43
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:33,440
That's comforting, Richard, but it
wasn't just you I was worried about.

44
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,360
Your concern is touching.

45
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:39,960
The people in that room will
represent billions of pounds
worth of potential investment.

46
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:44,190
Mr Saxon wants to be sure
they'll like what they see.

47
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:48,410
Don't worry. Our friend
will get his money's worth.

48
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:53,210
You wanted to see the guest
lists for tonight, Professor.

49
00:03:53,210 --> 00:03:55,710
Yes, thank you, Letitia.

50
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:02,510
That's an interesting perfume.

51
00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:05,310
What's it called? Soap.

52
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:14,910
Oh, black tie. Whenever I wear this,
something bad always happens.

53
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:17,980
That's not the outfit,
that's just you.

54
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:20,860
Anyway, I think it suits you...

55
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:22,860
in a James Bond kinda way.

56
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:25,470
James Bond? Really?

57
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:48,700
Oh, look, they've got nibbles!

58
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:50,360
I love nibbles.

59
00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:54,460
Hello!

60
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:56,190
Tish!

61
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:58,680
You look great!

62
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:01,560
Impressive, isn't it? Very.

63
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:02,910
And two nights out in a row for you?

64
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:06,440
That's a social life! I'll end up
in all the gossip columns.

65
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:10,970
You should keep an eye out for
photographers. And Mum. She's
even dragging Leo along with her.

66
00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:13,080
Leo? In black tie?

67
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:16,160
That I must see!

68
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,960
This is, er, The Doctor.

69
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:20,000
Hello.

70
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,300
Is he with you? Yeah.

71
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:24,030
But he's not on the list.
How did he get in?

72
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:25,950
He's my plus one.

73
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:28,250
So, this Lazarus, he's your boss?

74
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:31,130
Professor Lazarus, yes.
I'm part of his executive staff.

75
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:34,590
She's in the PR department. I'm head
of the PR department, actually.

76
00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:36,890
You're joking?!
I put this whole thing together.

77
00:05:36,890 --> 00:05:39,000
So, do you know what the Professor's
going to be doing tonight?

78
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,960
That looks like it might be a
sonic micro-field manipulator.

79
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:46,110
He's a science geek. I should've
known. Got to get back to work now.

80
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:48,030
I'll catch up with you later.

81
00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:53,400
That you're obsessively
enthusiastic about it.

82
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,130
Ah. Nice.

83
00:05:55,130 --> 00:06:00,120
Your father's caused me enough
heartache already with his menopause
and his trophy girlfriend.

84
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:04,160
Yeah, Mum. It was just something
he said last night. Martha!

85
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,080
Mum!

86
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:10,490
All right. What's the occasion?

87
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:12,030
What do you mean?

88
00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:14,720
I'm just pleased to see you, that's
all. But you saw me last night.

89
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:17,980
I know, I just...missed you.

90
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:20,480
You're looking good, Leo.

91
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:23,550
If anyone asks me to fetch them
a drink, I'll swing for them.

92
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:26,620
You disappeared last night. I...

93
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:28,540
I just went home.

94
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:31,610
On your own?

95
00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:35,070
This is a friend of mine,
The Doctor. Doctor what?

96
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:36,600
No, it's just The Doctor.

97
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,220
We've been doing some work together.

98
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:41,290
All right, mate? Lovely to meet you,
Mrs Jones. Heard a lot about you.

99
00:06:41,290 --> 00:06:42,940
Have you? What have you heard, then?

100
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:47,050
Well, you know, that
your Martha's mother and...

101
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:52,160
Um, no, actually, that's about it.

102
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:57,150
We haven't had much time to chat,
you know? Been busy. Busy?
Doing what, exactly?

103
00:06:57,150 --> 00:06:58,680
Oh.

104
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:01,370
You know...stuff.

105
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:05,600
Ladies and Gentlemen,

106
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:12,510
I'm Professor Richard
Lazarus and tonight
I'm going to perform a miracle!

107
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:18,650
It is, I believe,
the most important advance
since Rutherford split the atom.

108
00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:22,300
The biggest leap
since Armstrong stood on the moon.

109
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:24,410
Tonight,

110
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:27,480
you will watch and wonder.

111
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:34,090
But tomorrow,
you will wake to a world
which will be changed forever.

112
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:15,100
MACHINE BEEPS
Something's wrong. It's overloading.

113
00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:32,960
Somebody stop him!
Get him away from those controls!

114
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:36,600
If this thing goes up it, it'll
take the whole building with it!

115
00:08:48,590 --> 00:08:50,040
Get it open!

116
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:17,770
Ladies and Gentlemen,

117
00:09:17,770 --> 00:09:20,760
I am Richard Lazarus.

118
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:23,640
I am 76 years old.

119
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:25,370
And I am reborn!

120
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:31,900
He did it.

121
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:34,970
He actually did it!

122
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:41,690
That can't be the same guy.
It's impossible. It must be a trick.

123
00:09:41,690 --> 00:09:43,420
Oh, it's not a trick.

124
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:45,040
I wish it were.

125
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,640
What just happened then?

126
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:50,300
He just changed
what it means to be human.

127
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:54,750
Excuse me.

128
00:09:56,280 --> 00:10:01,160
That was the most astonishing thing
I've ever seen.

129
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:03,200
Look at you!

130
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,120
This is only the beginning.

131
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:08,570
We're not just making history,
we're shaping the future, too.

132
00:10:08,570 --> 00:10:11,260
Think of the money we'll make!

133
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:14,600
People will sell their souls
to be transformed like that.

134
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:17,870
And I'll be first in line!

135
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:20,090
HE GASPS

136
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:34,300
Richard! I'm famished.

137
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:37,950
Energy deficit. Always happens
with this kind of process.

138
00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:41,020
You talk as if you see this
every day, Mr...? Doctor.

139
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:46,400
And no, not every day, but I
have some experience of this kind of
transformation. That's not possible.

140
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:50,240
Using hyper-sonic sound waves to
create a state of resonance?
That's inspired.

141
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,160
You understand the theory, then?

142
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:56,190
You couldn't possibly have allowed
for all the variables.

143
00:10:56,190 --> 00:10:58,300
No experiment is
entirely without risk.

144
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:01,950
The thing nearly exploded! You might
as well have stepped into a blender!

145
00:11:01,950 --> 00:11:04,250
You're not qualified to comment.

146
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:06,640
If I hadn't stopped it,
it would've exploded.

147
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:09,630
Then I thank you, Doctor. But
that's a simple engineering issue.

148
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:12,890
What happened inside the capsule was
exactly what was supposed to happen.

149
00:11:12,890 --> 00:11:17,690
No more. No less.
You've no way of knowing that
until you've run proper tests.

150
00:11:17,690 --> 00:11:21,340
Look at me! See what happened.
I'm all the proof you need.

151
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:26,720
The device will be properly
certified before we start to
operate commercially. Commercially?!

152
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:29,100
You are joking! That'll cause chaos.

153
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:30,750
Not chaos.

154
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:35,360
Change. A chance for
humanity to evolve, to improve.

155
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:39,390
This isn't about improving,
this is about you and your
customers living a little longer.

156
00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:41,500
Not a little longer, Doctor,

157
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:45,530
a lot longer. Perhaps indefinitely.

158
00:11:45,530 --> 00:11:48,030
Richard, we have things to discuss.

159
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:50,910
Upstairs. Goodbye, Doctor.

160
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:54,750
In a few years, you'll look back
and laugh at how wrong you were.

161
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:05,690
Ooh, he's out of his depth. He's no
idea the damage he might have done.

162
00:12:05,690 --> 00:12:08,000
So what do we do now?

163
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:13,560
Now? Well, this building must
be full of laboratories,
I say we do our own tests.

164
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:18,170
Lucky I've just collected a DNA
sample then, isn't it? Oh, oh, oh!

165
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:20,860
Martha Jones, you're a star!

166
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,080
I grew up over there.

167
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:27,580
Tiny flat above a butcher's shop.

168
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:30,080
It'll have a blue plaque soon.

169
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:32,190
"Richard Lazarus lived here."

170
00:12:32,190 --> 00:12:34,110
It's gone.

171
00:12:34,110 --> 00:12:37,070
Destroyed in the war. The bombing.

172
00:12:37,070 --> 00:12:39,290
Of course.

173
00:12:39,290 --> 00:12:42,440
1940. Do you remember?

174
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:44,480
Night after night...

175
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,970
Explosions.

176
00:12:46,970 --> 00:12:48,700
Guns.

177
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:51,200
Fire storms.

178
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:54,270
My parents had sent me
to the country by then.

179
00:12:54,270 --> 00:12:57,340
When the sirens went,
we'd go to the cathedral there.

180
00:12:57,340 --> 00:13:00,030
People used to shelter in the crypt.

181
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:03,480
The living, cowering among the dead.

182
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:06,560
But look what you've built here now.

183
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:10,400
You've laid the foundations
for an empire.

184
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:13,280
An empire we can rule together.

185
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:23,260
What's wrong?

186
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:25,180
HE SCOFFS

187
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:30,170
Look at yourself, woman.

188
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:36,700
Amazing. What?

189
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:38,620
Lazarus's DNA.

190
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:41,500
I can't see anything different.
Look at it.

191
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:45,340
Oh, my God! Did that just change?

192
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:47,840
But it can't have!

193
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:51,870
It did. It's impossible.
Two impossible things
we've seen so far tonight.

194
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:53,790
Don't you love it when that happens?

195
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:57,130
That means Lazarus has changed
his own molecular patterns.

196
00:13:57,130 --> 00:13:59,930
Hyper-sonic sound waves to
destabilise the cell structure.

197
00:13:59,930 --> 00:14:03,000
Then a metagenetic programme
to manipulate the coding.

198
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,460
He hacked into his own genes
and instructed them to rejuvenate.

199
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:08,000
But they're still mutating now.

200
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,490
Because he missed something.

201
00:14:10,490 --> 00:14:13,760
Something in his DNA's been activated
and won't let him stabilise.

202
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,680
Something's trying to change him.

203
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:20,090
Change him into what? I don't know,
but I think we need to find out.

204
00:14:20,090 --> 00:14:23,740
That woman said they
were going upstairs. Let's go.

205
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:26,810
It's me who made all this possible.

206
00:14:26,810 --> 00:14:29,880
This is my triumph, and I will not
be denied. Not by you.

207
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:32,760
Not after everything I've done.

208
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:36,800
You backed me because you saw
profit. Your concern was financial.

209
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,910
You want the money as much as I do.

210
00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:41,980
We had a plan.

211
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:45,440
When the device is ready,
I'll be rejuvenated too.

212
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:49,080
We could
be rich and young and together.

213
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:52,160
You think I'd waste
another lifetime on you?

214
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:58,490
Did that process make you
even more cruel?

215
00:14:58,490 --> 00:15:01,760
No, my love,
that I learned from you.

216
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:04,060
You have a gift for it.

217
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:08,280
Then you'll know that I'll protect
my involvement in the project.

218
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:11,360
I'm sure
Mr Saxon will be interested.

219
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,660
What's going on?

220
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:15,850
It must just be...

221
00:15:15,850 --> 00:15:17,690
What is it?

222
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,340
I'll be fine in a moment.

223
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:23,920
It's probably just cramp.

224
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:27,100
HE GASPS
Richard?

225
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,710
Is it some kind of seizure?

226
00:15:31,710 --> 00:15:33,240
What should I do?

227
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:35,930
I don't understand what's happening.

228
00:15:37,850 --> 00:15:40,540
Richard?
BONES CRUNCH

229
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:42,730
CREATURE SNARLS

230
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:54,850
Tish.

231
00:15:54,850 --> 00:15:57,450
Have you seen Martha and that
doctor anywhere?

232
00:15:57,450 --> 00:15:59,550
Not since the demonstration.

233
00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:02,810
Do you know anything about him? Has
she mentioned him before? Not to me.

234
00:16:02,810 --> 00:16:07,610
The way she followed him.
She's a doctor just doing her job.
She's not a doctor yet.

235
00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:10,110
Never will be if she
doesn't stay focused.

236
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:12,410
Look, she's found a bloke. So what?

237
00:16:12,410 --> 00:16:14,910
There's something's going on, Leo.

238
00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:16,910
I can feel it.

239
00:16:32,270 --> 00:16:34,680
Letitia Jones!

240
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:38,140
I'd recognise the smell of
that soap anywhere! Professor.

241
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:43,420
I'm sorry, ladies and gentlemen,
you'll have to excuse me while
I take care of Letitia here.

242
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:45,770
I've been neglecting her.

243
00:16:51,770 --> 00:16:54,840
This is his office, all right.

244
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:57,530
So where is he?

245
00:16:57,530 --> 00:17:01,760
Don't know. Let's try back at the...
reception.

246
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:11,740
Is that Lady Thaw?

247
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:13,470
Used to be.

248
00:17:13,470 --> 00:17:18,460
It's just a shell, had all the
life energy drained out of her.

249
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:22,760
Like squeezing the juice
out of an orange. Lazarus!

250
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:24,990
Could be. So he's changed already.

251
00:17:24,990 --> 00:17:28,250
Not necessarily.
You saw the DNA, it was fluctuating.

252
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:31,130
The process must demand energy.
This might not have been enough.

253
00:17:31,130 --> 00:17:33,820
So he might do this again? Mmm.

254
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:45,150
You seem very young to have
such a responsible position.
Have you much experience?

255
00:17:45,150 --> 00:17:49,450
Not really,
but the interview panel thought
I had all the necessary attributes.

256
00:17:49,450 --> 00:17:52,250
How perceptive of them.

257
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:55,710
So, where are you taking me? Up
to the roof. It's a lovely evening.

258
00:17:55,710 --> 00:17:58,590
I thought I would show you the view.
It's extraordinary.

259
00:17:58,590 --> 00:18:00,700
Like a lot of things
round here, then.

260
00:18:04,730 --> 00:18:06,270
BONES CRUNCH

261
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:13,370
I can't see him.
He can't be far. Keep looking.

262
00:18:13,370 --> 00:18:15,870
Hey, you all right, Marth?
I think Mum wants to talk to you.

263
00:18:15,870 --> 00:18:18,560
Have you seen Lazarus anywhere?
Well, he was getting cosy with Tish
a couple of minutes ago.

264
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:20,860
With Tish?! Ah, Doctor.

265
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:23,550
Where did they go?
Upstairs, I think. Why?

266
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:26,890
Doctor... I'm speaking to you!
Not now, Mum!

267
00:18:29,310 --> 00:18:31,610
I think you need one of these.

268
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:35,260
Thank you. That's very kind of you.

269
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:37,370
Do you know that man?

270
00:18:37,370 --> 00:18:41,020
No. He's a friend of my daughter's.

271
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:43,680
Perhaps she should choose
her friends more carefully.

272
00:18:51,770 --> 00:18:55,040
Where are they? The fluctuating
DNA'll give off an energy signature.

273
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:56,380
I might be able to pick it up.

274
00:18:58,490 --> 00:19:00,990
Got him. Where?

275
00:19:00,990 --> 00:19:02,640
But this is the top floor. The roof!

276
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:07,130
That clock tower is beautiful,
all lit up like that.

277
00:19:07,130 --> 00:19:11,930
It's Southwark Cathedral, one
of the oldest churches in London.

278
00:19:11,930 --> 00:19:15,000
Been around even longer than I have.

279
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,500
You're looking pretty
good for your age!

280
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:20,190
Thank you.

281
00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:21,920
Can I...?

282
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:24,030
Of course.

283
00:19:31,130 --> 00:19:32,860
I still can't take it in.

284
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:37,080
I'm still adjusting, myself.

285
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:39,200
I've been working toward it
for so many years.

286
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,880
It's hard to believe
the moment's finally arrived.

287
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:44,270
And is it like you expected?

288
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:49,760
I find that nothing's ever
exactly like you expect.

289
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:51,560
There's always
something to surprise you.

290
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:57,630
"Between the idea and the reality,
between the motion and the act."

291
00:19:57,630 --> 00:20:00,890
"..Falls the shadow."

292
00:20:00,890 --> 00:20:05,690
So, the mysterious Doctor
knows his Eliot. I'm impressed.

293
00:20:05,690 --> 00:20:10,490
Martha? Tish, get away from him!
What? Don't tell me what to do.

294
00:20:10,490 --> 00:20:16,060
You had time for poetry, Lazarus,
even being so busy defying the laws
of nature? You're right, Doctor.

295
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:19,320
One lifetime's been too short
for me to do everything I'd like.

296
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:25,280
How much more I'll get done
in two or three or four.
It doesn't work like that.

297
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:29,690
Some people live more
in 20 years than others do in 80.

298
00:20:29,690 --> 00:20:32,380
It's not the time that matters,
it's the person.

299
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:35,070
But if it's the right person,

300
00:20:35,070 --> 00:20:39,100
what a gift that would be!
Or what a curse.

301
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:41,980
Look at what you've done to yourself.

302
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:43,900
Who are you to judge me?

303
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:47,360
Over here, Tish. You have to spoil
everything, don't you?

304
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:50,240
Every time I find someone nice,
you have to try and find fault.

305
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:55,610
He's a monster! The age thing's
a bit freaky, but it works
for Catherine Zeta Jones!

Security one.

314
00:21:32,170 --> 00:21:34,970
What's happening? An intrusion.

315
00:21:34,970 --> 00:21:39,200
It triggers a security lockdown,
kills most of the power, stops
the lifts, seals the exits.

316
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,690
He must be breaking
through that door.

317
00:21:41,690 --> 00:21:44,190
The stairs, come on!

318
00:21:46,110 --> 00:21:49,180

319
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:52,060
He's inside!
We haven't got much time.

320
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:59,550
Tish, is there another way out?
There's an exit in the corner,
but it'll be locked now. Martha!

321
00:21:59,550 --> 00:22:01,470
Setting 54. Hurry.

322
00:22:01,470 --> 00:22:03,390
Listen to me!

323
00:22:03,390 --> 00:22:07,040
You people are in serious danger. You
need to get out of here right now!

324
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:09,530
The biggest danger here
is choking on an olive!

00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:39,680
Over here! This way. Everyone
down the stairs, now! Hurry!

329
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:48,970
No! Get away from her!

Leave them alone!

335
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:11,930
Martha. Come on, stay with me.

336
00:23:11,930 --> 00:23:15,770
What's the point? You can't control
it. The mutation is too strong.

337
00:23:15,770 --> 00:23:19,230
Killing those people won't help you.
You're a fool.

338
00:23:19,230 --> 00:23:22,880
A vain, old man
who thought he could defy nature.

339
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:26,140
Only Nature got her
own back, didn't she?

340
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:29,290
You're a joke, Lazarus!

341
00:23:29,290 --> 00:23:32,480
A footnote in the history of failure.

342
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,590
SNARLING

343
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:49,760
What's the Doctor doing? He's trying
to buy us some time. Leo,
focus on me. Let me see your eyes.

344
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:54,940
He's got concussion. Mum,
you'll need to help him downstairs.

345
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:56,480
This'll keep the swelling down.

346
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,780
Go, I'll be right behind you.

347
00:24:00,510 --> 00:24:02,620
Tish, move!
We need to get out of here.

348
00:24:30,650 --> 00:24:32,380
It's no good, Doctor.

349
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:34,490
You can't stop me.

350
00:24:34,490 --> 00:24:37,760
Is that the same arrogance you
had when you swore that nothing
had gone wrong with your device?

351
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:42,560
The arrogance is yours. You
can't stand in the way of progress.

352
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:46,400
You call feeding on
innocent people progress?

353
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,890
You're delusional!

354
00:24:48,890 --> 00:24:51,580
It is a necessary sacrifice!

355
00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:53,580
That's not your decision to make.

356
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:01,370
We're trapped!
There must be an over-ride switch.
Where's the security desk? Tish!

357
00:25:01,370 --> 00:25:03,030
There.

358
00:25:22,490 --> 00:25:23,840
Peek-a-boo!

359
00:25:27,370 --> 00:25:29,140
Oh. Hello.

360
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,970
I've got to go back.

361
00:25:34,970 --> 00:25:41,390
You can't! You saw what that
thing did. It'll kill you.
I don't care. I have to go.

362
00:25:41,390 --> 00:25:43,880
It's that Doctor, isn't it?

363
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:46,490
That's what's happened to you.
That's why you've changed.

364
00:25:46,490 --> 00:25:48,800
He was buying us time, Martha.

365
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:51,480
Time for you to get out too.
I'm not leaving him.

366
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:54,560
Martha!

367
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:27,930
GAS HISSES

368
00:26:30,270 --> 00:26:32,760
GLASS SMASHES

369
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:35,640
More hide and seek, Doctor?

370
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:37,760
How disappointing.

371
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:40,060
GAS HISSES

372
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:46,590
Why don't you come out and face me?
Have you looked in the mirror lately?

373
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:51,580
Why would I want to face that, hmm?

374
00:27:06,170 --> 00:27:10,200
What are you doing here?
Thought you might need this.
How did you...?

375
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:13,470
Heard the explosion. I blasted
Lazarus. Did you kill him?

376
00:27:13,470 --> 00:27:15,390
More, sort of, annoyed him, I'd say.

377
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:19,800
She'll be all right.

378
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:22,300
The Doctor and her,
they'll look out for each other.

379
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:24,410
She turned her back on us,

380
00:27:24,410 --> 00:27:26,600
went in there with that thing.

381
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:28,830
For him.

382
00:27:28,830 --> 00:27:31,130
He must be some guy.

383
00:27:31,130 --> 00:27:33,240
Maybe she loves him.

384
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:34,970
She just met him!

385
00:27:34,970 --> 00:27:38,810
Is your daughter still in there
with The Doctor? Do you know him?

386
00:27:39,770 --> 00:27:41,690
He's dangerous.

387
00:27:41,690 --> 00:27:43,310
There are things you should know.

388
00:27:43,310 --> 00:27:45,040
What things?

389
00:27:47,070 --> 00:27:48,990
INAUDIBLE WHISPER

390
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:54,170
What now?
We've just gone round in a circle.

391
00:27:54,170 --> 00:27:56,560
We can't lead him outside.
Come on, get in.

392
00:27:59,550 --> 00:28:01,360
Are we hiding?

393
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:05,120
No, he knows we're here,
but this is his masterpiece.

394
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:07,800
I'm betting he won't destroy it,
not even to get at us.

395
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:12,410
But we're trapped. Well, yeah,
that is a slight problem.

396
00:28:12,410 --> 00:28:16,440
You mean you don't have a plan? Yes.
The plan was to get inside here.

397
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:20,670
Then what? Well, then
I'd come up with another plan.

398
00:28:20,670 --> 00:28:22,970
In your own time, then.

399
00:28:27,390 --> 00:28:29,500
Hey! Sorry, sorry, sorry.

400
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:32,960
Ah. Here we are.
What are you going to do with that?

401
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:34,490
Improvise.

402
00:28:37,450 --> 00:28:40,520
CREATURE SNARLS

403
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:43,710
I still don't understand where
that thing came from. Is it alien?

404
00:28:43,710 --> 00:28:46,010
No. For once, it's
strictly human in origin.

405
00:28:46,010 --> 00:28:47,740
Human? How can it be human?

406
00:28:47,740 --> 00:28:51,000
Probably from dormant genes in
Lazarus's DNA. This reactivated them.

407
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,460
Now it looks like they're becoming
dominant. So it's a throwback.

408
00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:59,640
Some option that evolution rejected
millions of years ago.
But the potential is still there,

409
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:03,870
locked away in your genes, forgotten,
until Lazarus unlocked it by mistake.
It's like Pandora's box.

410
00:29:03,870 --> 00:29:05,980
Exactly. Nice shoes, by the way.

411
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:12,890
MACHINE WHIRRS

412
00:29:12,890 --> 00:29:15,770
Doctor, what's happening?
He's switched the machine on.

413
00:29:15,770 --> 00:29:19,420
That's not good, is it? I was hoping
it would to take him a bit longer.

414
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:25,640
I don't want to hurry you, but...
I know, I know. Nearly done.
Well, what are you doing?

415
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:30,560
Setting the capsule to reflect energy
rather than receive it.
Will that kill him?

416
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:34,590
When he transforms, he's three times
the size, spreading himself thin.

417
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:40,920
We're going to end up like him!
Just one more.

418
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:52,720
I thought we were going to go
through the blender then.

419
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:55,900
It really shouldn't take that long
just to reverse the polarity.

420
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:58,590
I must be a bit out of practice.

421
00:30:05,190 --> 00:30:08,280
He seems so....

422
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:10,880
human again.

423
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,600
It's kind of pitiful.

424
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:17,600
Eliot saw that too.
"This is the way the world ends

425
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:20,090
"Not with a bang, but a whimper."

426
00:30:43,130 --> 00:30:46,400
She's here! Oh, she's all right!

427
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:49,740
Mrs Jones!
We still haven't finished our chat.

428
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:53,120
Keep away from my daughter.
Mum, what are you doing?

429
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:55,310
Always the mothers! Every time!

430
00:30:55,310 --> 00:30:57,920
He's dangerous.
I've been told things.

431
00:30:57,920 --> 00:31:00,410
What are you talking about?

432
00:31:00,410 --> 00:31:05,600
Look around you.
Nothing but death and destruction.
This isn't his fault.

433
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:07,130
He saved us. All of us!

434
00:31:07,130 --> 00:31:08,670
And it was Tish who invited everyone
to this thing in the first place.

435
00:31:08,670 --> 00:31:10,970
So I'd say, technically,
it was her fault.

436
00:31:12,510 --> 00:31:15,000
CRASH

437
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:20,190
Leave him.

438
00:31:24,990 --> 00:31:26,910
Martha?

439
00:31:26,910 --> 00:31:29,020
Not you, too.

440
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:30,750
Sorry.

441
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:38,240
Lazarus, back from the dead.

442
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:40,350
Should've known, really.
Where's he gone?

443
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:45,340
That way.

444
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:48,410
The church. Cathedral.

445
00:31:48,410 --> 00:31:50,330
It's Southwark Cathedral.

446
00:31:50,330 --> 00:31:52,640
He told me.

447
00:32:06,650 --> 00:32:12,030
Do you think he's in here?
Where would you go, if you
were looking for sanctuary?

448
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:36,220
HE GASPS

449
00:32:42,940 --> 00:32:45,630
I came here before.

450
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:48,120
A lifetime ago.

451
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:50,430
I thought I was going to die then.

452
00:32:50,430 --> 00:32:53,500
In fact, I was sure of it.

453
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:56,000
I sat here...

454
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:59,070
just a child.

455
00:32:59,070 --> 00:33:03,290
The sound of planes
and bombs outside. The Blitz.

456
00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:08,090
You've read about it? I was there.

457
00:33:09,630 --> 00:33:12,510
You're too young.

458
00:33:12,510 --> 00:33:14,770
So are you.

459
00:33:15,770 --> 00:33:17,500
BONES CRUNCH

460
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:25,180
In the morning, the fires had died,

461
00:33:25,180 --> 00:33:27,180
but I was still alive.

462
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:31,020
I swore I'd never face
death like that again...

463
00:33:33,050 --> 00:33:35,160
..so defenceless.

464
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:39,770
I would arm myself, fight back.

465
00:33:39,770 --> 00:33:41,310
Defeat it.

466
00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:44,570
That's what you were trying to
do today? That's what I DID today.

467
00:33:44,570 --> 00:33:48,600
What about the other people who died?
They were nothing.

468
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:50,720
I changed the course of history.

469
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:55,710
Any of them might've done too.
You think history is only
made with equations?

470
00:33:55,710 --> 00:33:58,590
Facing death is part of being human.

471
00:33:58,590 --> 00:34:02,620
You can't change that. No, Doctor.

472
00:34:02,620 --> 00:34:05,880
Avoiding death, that's being human.

473
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:10,300
It's our strongest impulse, to cling
to life with every fibre of being.

474
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:14,520
I'm only doing what everyone
before me has tried to do.

475
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:17,210
I've simply been more successful.

476
00:34:17,210 --> 00:34:19,130
HE GASPS, BONES CRUNCH

477
00:34:19,130 --> 00:34:22,010
Look at yourself. You're mutating.

478
00:34:22,010 --> 00:34:25,660
You've no control over it. You call
that a success? I call it progress.

479
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:32,190
I'm more now than I was.

480
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:35,840
More than just an ordinary human.

481
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:39,870
There is no such thing
as an ordinary human.

482
00:34:39,870 --> 00:34:42,360
He's going to change
again any minute.

483
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:49,160
I know. If I could get him up into
the bell tower somehow, I've an idea
that might work. Up there?

484
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:57,530
You're so sentimental, Doctor.

485
00:34:57,530 --> 00:35:00,030
Maybe you are older than you look.

486
00:35:00,030 --> 00:35:03,480
I'm old enough to know that a longer
life isn't always a better one.

487
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:08,090
In the end, you just get tired.

488
00:35:08,090 --> 00:35:10,400
Tired of the struggle.

489
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:13,660
Tired of losing everyone
that matters to you.

490
00:35:15,770 --> 00:35:18,840
Tired of watching everything...
turn to dust.

491
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:24,030
If you live long enough, Lazarus,

492
00:35:24,030 --> 00:35:27,680
the only certainty left
is that you'll end up alone.

493
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:30,170
That's a price worth paying.

494
00:35:31,790 --> 00:35:34,670
Is it?

495
00:35:34,670 --> 00:35:36,700
BONES CRUNCH

496
00:35:44,190 --> 00:35:46,300
I will feed soon.

497
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:50,330
I'm not going to let that happen.

498
00:35:50,330 --> 00:35:53,600
You've not been able to stop me
so far! Leave him, Lazarus.

499
00:35:55,130 --> 00:35:57,050
He's old and bitter.

500
00:35:57,050 --> 00:36:01,660
I thought you had a taste
for fresher meat? Martha, no!

501
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:05,690
What are you doing? Keeping you out
of trouble. Doctor. The tower!

502
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:13,760
HE GROANS

503
00:36:14,990 --> 00:36:18,560
Did you hear that?
SNARLING

504
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:21,820
He's changed again. Keep moving.
We've got to lead him up.

505
00:36:27,390 --> 00:36:28,540
Where are they?

506
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:32,000
Martha?!

507
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:36,990
Doctor! Take him to the very top
of the bell tower! Do you hear me?

508
00:36:36,990 --> 00:36:40,440
Up to the top?
Martha? And then what?

509
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:41,980
Martha, come on!

510
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:00,990
Hyper-sonic sound waves. Inspired.

511
00:37:08,090 --> 00:37:09,630
There's nowhere else to go.

512
00:37:09,630 --> 00:37:14,620
This is where he said to bring him.
So then we're not trapped. We're
bait! He knows what he's doing.

513
00:37:14,620 --> 00:37:17,390
We have to trust him. Ladies!

514
00:37:22,110 --> 00:37:24,800
Stay behind me.

515
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:30,750
If he takes me, make a run for it.
Head back down the stairs. You
should have time. But... Just do it!

516
00:37:32,090 --> 00:37:34,590
SCREAMS

517
00:37:34,590 --> 00:37:37,280
I hope there's a good
acoustics in here!

ORGAN PLAYS

519
00:37:50,910 --> 00:37:54,830
Martha!
MARTHA SCREAMS

520
00:37:54,830 --> 00:37:57,440
Martha!

521
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:00,320
Get away from her!

522
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:02,430
ORGAN PLAYS

523
00:38:07,420 --> 00:38:10,110
We need to turn this up to eleven!

524
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:13,530
ORGAN MUSIC GROWS LOUDER

525
00:38:35,450 --> 00:38:37,760
I've got you! Hold on!

526
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:39,370
Martha!

527
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:49,740
I'm OK.

528
00:38:49,740 --> 00:38:51,510
We're both OK!

529
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:00,030
Thanks. It's your Doctor
you should be thanking.

530
00:39:00,030 --> 00:39:01,760
I told you he'd think of something.

531
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:06,360
He cut it a bit fine, though! He
always does. It's more fun that way.

532
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:08,560
Who is he?

533
00:39:10,970 --> 00:39:12,320
He's...

534
00:39:14,620 --> 00:39:16,480
He's the Doctor.

535
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:49,180
I didn't know you could play.

536
00:39:49,180 --> 00:39:53,400
Oh, well, if you hang around
with Beethoven, you're
bound to pick a few things up.

537
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:55,320
Especially about playing loud.

538
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:57,050
Sorry?

539
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:06,270
Something else that just
kind of escalated, then.

540
00:40:06,270 --> 00:40:10,190
I can see a pattern developing. You
should take more care in the future.

541
00:40:10,190 --> 00:40:13,950
And the past. And whatever other
time period you find yourself in.

542
00:40:13,950 --> 00:40:16,250
It's been fun, though, hasn't it?
Yeah.

543
00:40:16,250 --> 00:40:19,710
So what do you say, one more trip?

544
00:40:23,930 --> 00:40:28,730
No. Sorry. What do you mean?
I thought you liked it?

545
00:40:28,730 --> 00:40:30,460
I do, but I can't go on like this.

546
00:40:30,460 --> 00:40:33,340
"One more trip." It's not fair.
What are you talking about?

547
00:40:33,340 --> 00:40:37,840
I don't want to be just a
passenger any more, someone that
you take along for a treat.

548
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:41,020
If that's how you still see me,
well then, I'd rather stay here.

549
00:40:41,020 --> 00:40:43,130
OK, then. If that's what you want.

550
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:50,120
Right. Well, we've already
said goodbye once today.

551
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:52,700
It's probably best if you just go.

552
00:40:56,570 --> 00:40:58,110
What is it?

553
00:40:58,110 --> 00:41:00,600
What? I said, OK. Sorry?

554
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:02,720
OK!

555
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:05,210
Oh, thank you! Thank you!

556
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:10,590
Well, you were never really
"just a passenger", were you?

557
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:17,880
PHONE RINGS
'Hi, I'm out leave a message.'

558
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:20,190
Martha? It's your mother.

559
00:41:20,190 --> 00:41:22,110
'Please phone me back.

560
00:41:22,110 --> 00:41:25,180
'I'm begging you,
I know who this Doctor really is.

561
00:41:25,180 --> 00:41:28,440
'I know he's dangerous.
You're gonna get yourself killed.

562
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:32,670
'Please, trust me, this information
comes from Harold Saxon himself.

563
00:41:32,670 --> 00:41:34,200
'You're not safe.'

564
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:41,310
We need a time lord.

565
00:41:46,490 --> 00:41:50,140
Martha, you trust me, don't you? Of
course. Cos it all depends on you.

566
00:41:50,140 --> 00:41:52,830
I mean it this time.
Tell me about it!

567
00:41:52,830 --> 00:41:55,900
SCREAMING

568
00:41:55,900 --> 00:41:59,740
It all took
place in the future. ..Whoa!

569
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:05,960
God help him! Doctor, what do we do?

570
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:08,760
Don't look away, and don't... RUN!

571
00:42:11,070 --> 00:42:14,520
Doctor! What exactly do you do
for him? Why does he need you?

572
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:18,360
Martha! Was someone kissing me?

573
00:42:25,660 --> 00:42:28,730
He's fire and ice.

574
00:42:28,730 --> 00:42:31,690
And rage. He's like the night,

575
00:42:31,690 --> 00:42:33,720
and the storm in
the heart of the sun.
