00:02:23,087 --> 00:02:24,182
Hello!

6
00:02:31,037 --> 00:02:34,362
Hello and welcome
to the first ever Doctor Who prom,

7
00:02:34,462 --> 00:02:37,056
here in the wonderful
Royal Albert Hall.

8
00:02:37,365 --> 00:02:40,712
I'm Freema Agyeman and
I play Martha Jones in Doctor Who.

9
00:02:42,862 --> 00:02:44,137
Thank you!

10
00:02:45,953 --> 00:02:47,417
Now, I've been lucky enough

11
00:02:47,517 --> 00:02:49,657
to actually travel in the TARDIS.

12
00:02:49,926 --> 00:02:52,513
But today,
through the power of music,

13
00:02:52,784 --> 00:02:55,434
you get to experience
what that feels like too.

14
00:02:56,178 --> 00:02:59,302
This concert is a celebration
of the music of Doctor Who,

15
00:02:59,402 --> 00:03:01,157
composed by Murray Gold.

16
00:03:01,466 --> 00:03:04,635
Murray has written the music for
the last four seasons of Doctor Who

17
00:03:04,735 --> 00:03:08,625
and our Christmas specials.
And now we celebrate the monsters

18
00:03:08,725 --> 00:03:11,160
and the aliens that have kept
some of you out there

19
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:13,468
hiding behind the sofa
on Saturday nights

20
00:03:13,645 --> 00:03:18,152
and have kept Martha Jones
running and running and running!

21
00:03:19,528 --> 00:03:22,557
Conductor Ben Foster
takes us on a journey to discover

22
00:03:22,657 --> 00:03:24,481
all the strange, strange creatures.

23
00:07:44,207 --> 00:07:46,626
Now, let's take a moment to rejoice

24
00:07:46,726 --> 00:07:49,417
in this wonderful Time Lord,
the Doctor.

25
00:07:49,898 --> 00:07:52,447
We're going to remember
how he first met Rose Tyler

26
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:56,306
and then how Martha Jones travelled
the world keeping hope alive

27
00:07:56,571 --> 00:07:58,602
while the Master reigned supreme.

28
00:07:59,088 --> 00:08:01,455
To begin this sequence of music
from the series,

29
00:08:01,555 --> 00:08:03,327
please welcome back Ben Foster

30
00:08:03,544 --> 00:08:04,919
with The Doctor Forever.

31
00:19:24,641 --> 00:19:27,139
In that long sequence of music
from Doctor Who,

32
00:19:27,239 --> 00:19:31,796
we heard The Doctor Forever, Rose's
Theme and Martha Versus The Master.

33
00:19:31,896 --> 00:19:35,410
And I'm totally unbiased,
but the last bit was my favourite!

34
00:19:38,268 --> 00:19:39,167
But now,

35
00:19:39,327 --> 00:19:41,720
we've got a special treat for you.

36
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:46,297
This is truly exciting. We're going
to hear from the man himself.

37
00:19:46,888 --> 00:19:51,222
In a worldwide exclusive, never
seen before, especially for you,

38
00:19:51,525 --> 00:19:53,750
here's a brand-new mini-adventure

39
00:19:53,850 --> 00:19:56,690
starring that wanderer
from Gallifrey, the Doctor.

40
00:19:56,790 --> 00:20:00,071
Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls,
today at the Royal Albert Hall,

41
00:20:00,171 --> 00:20:03,530
here is the premiere
of Music Of The Spheres.

42
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:19,010
Not now, I'm busy!

43
00:20:20,762 --> 00:20:22,029
And now, what?

44
00:20:22,227 --> 00:20:23,462
ALERT
TELEPORT BREACH

45
00:20:23,710 --> 00:20:24,327
What?

46
00:20:24,845 --> 00:20:25,735
What?

47
00:20:28,859 --> 00:20:32,324
Oi! Get out of my TARDIS!
I let down the defenses for one second!

48
00:20:32,673 --> 00:20:33,769
I must speak to the Doctor!

49
00:20:34,017 --> 00:20:35,756
I don't care, you're a Graske,

50
00:20:35,856 --> 00:20:37,602
and a Graske is trouble.
Out!

51
00:20:38,777 --> 00:20:39,852
But that noise...

52
00:20:40,107 --> 00:20:41,910
Beautiful sound in the air,
what is it?

53
00:20:45,497 --> 00:20:49,484
If you must know,
it's the Music of the Spheres.

54
00:20:49,674 --> 00:20:51,662
Music of the Spheres is what?

55
00:20:51,762 --> 00:20:52,388
Well...

56
00:20:52,663 --> 00:20:55,136
You've got all these planets
revolving around suns,

57
00:20:55,322 --> 00:20:57,659
and all those suns revolving
around in a galaxy,

58
00:20:58,281 --> 00:21:00,597
and all those galaxies
revolving around each other.

59
00:21:01,374 --> 00:21:04,379
If you take the gravity patterns and
feed them to the TARDIS harmonic filter,

60
00:21:04,479 --> 00:21:05,212
that,

61
00:21:05,506 --> 00:21:06,547
Mr. Graske...

62
00:21:07,646 --> 00:21:09,485
is the sound of the Universe.

63
00:21:12,553 --> 00:21:14,450
The Universe sounds wonderful.

64
00:21:15,136 --> 00:21:16,057
Yeah...

65
00:21:17,018 --> 00:21:18,162
It does, doesn't it?

66
00:21:19,602 --> 00:21:22,397
- But you're still not staying!
- No, Graske came to warn you.

67
00:21:22,659 --> 00:21:23,219
About what?

68
00:21:23,319 --> 00:21:24,155
About that!

69
00:21:26,432 --> 00:21:28,278
Oh! Now...

70
00:21:29,347 --> 00:21:31,056
That looks like a space portal.

71
00:21:31,276 --> 00:21:32,375
Told you!
Danger!

72
00:21:32,506 --> 00:21:34,077
Nah, it's harmless.

73
00:21:34,917 --> 00:21:36,199
It's just a hole in space.

74
00:21:37,885 --> 00:21:39,744
I wonder what's on the other side.

75
00:21:44,805 --> 00:21:45,525
Hello?

76
00:21:47,415 --> 00:21:48,516
Where is that, then?

77
00:21:50,702 --> 00:21:52,168
Who are all those people?

78
00:21:53,803 --> 00:21:54,726
Hold on!

79
00:21:56,644 --> 00:21:58,504
That looks like...
Is that the Albert Hall?

80
00:22:00,438 --> 00:22:02,021
I said 'is that the Albert Hall?'

81
00:22:02,807 --> 00:22:04,046
"Yes!"

82
00:22:04,146 --> 00:22:07,016
I said 'is that the Albert Hall?'

83
00:22:07,182 --> 00:22:08,152
"Yes!"

84
00:22:08,252 --> 00:22:09,835
Oh! Brilliant!
Hello!

85
00:22:11,054 --> 00:22:12,332
I said 'hello!'

86
00:22:12,651 --> 00:22:13,975
"Hello!"

87
00:22:14,075 --> 00:22:18,807
No, no, no, sorry, you'll have to shout.
I said 'hello!'

88
00:22:18,907 --> 00:22:20,916
"Hello!"

89
00:22:21,196 --> 00:22:24,903
Listen, I'm the Doctor, I'm a Time Lord,
but that is an awful lot of people!

90
00:22:25,655 --> 00:22:27,189
What are you all doing there?
Oh!

91
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:32,315
Wait a minute, it's the Proms! Is that
the Proms? Are you in the Proms?

92
00:22:33,295 --> 00:22:36,092
Oh! I love the Proms!
I was in the very first Proms,

93
00:22:36,192 --> 00:22:38,330
1895, I played the tuba,
I was brilliant.

94
00:22:39,571 --> 00:22:40,926
Is that the orchestra down there?

95
00:22:41,198 --> 00:22:42,543
Oh! Wait a minute!

96
00:22:46,594 --> 00:22:51,175
'Cause, funny thing is, I've just been
composing something myself.

97
00:22:52,026 --> 00:22:55,067
I said to Beethoven I could rattle off
a tune, he said 'pardon'... But!

98
00:22:55,283 --> 00:22:58,741
I've just been inspired
by the Music of the Spheres.

99
00:22:59,526 --> 00:23:00,941
I've written my own symphony.

100
00:23:01,236 --> 00:23:01,870
Yeah.

101
00:23:02,185 --> 00:23:04,990
And if I can send these pages
through the portal

102
00:23:05,152 --> 00:23:07,423
then the orchestra can play it.

103
00:23:08,242 --> 00:23:09,563
A brand new piece of music.

104
00:23:10,306 --> 00:23:11,469
Composed by me.

105
00:23:12,348 --> 00:23:13,684
Ready for this, orchestra?

106
00:23:13,836 --> 00:23:14,660
Stand by!

107
00:23:15,003 --> 00:23:17,466
Three... Two... One...

108
00:23:21,059 --> 00:23:21,991
That's it, that's it.

109
00:23:24,206 --> 00:23:25,455
There you go, hurry up!

110
00:23:26,769 --> 00:23:29,260
This portal isn't gonna stay open
for long, right!

111
00:23:29,957 --> 00:23:30,518
Now!

112
00:23:30,618 --> 00:23:34,269
So! Er, if you don't mind,
Mr. conductor...

113
00:23:35,063 --> 00:23:35,911
Stand down.

114
00:23:37,098 --> 00:23:38,183
I'm in charge of this one.

115
00:23:38,467 --> 00:23:43,109
Quiet please! Shhht!
Silence, settle down.

116
00:23:43,422 --> 00:23:44,696
Oi! Settle down.

117
00:23:45,325 --> 00:23:45,935
So!

118
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,636
Ladies and Gentlemen...
and children,

119
00:23:48,971 --> 00:23:54,939
This is the world-wide premiere
of 'Ode to the Universe'.

120
00:23:56,266 --> 00:23:57,193
And...

121
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:12,641
Oh, come on, that was brilliant!

122
00:24:13,871 --> 00:24:19,268
Thank you... I thank you... No, no,
I thank you, really, you're too kind.

123
00:24:19,810 --> 00:24:22,654
Ah! You see, Graske, that's the thing
about Planet Earth.

124
00:24:23,575 --> 00:24:24,197
What?

125
00:24:24,534 --> 00:24:26,755
What? Where's he gone?

126
00:24:28,448 --> 00:24:29,082
No!

127
00:24:30,873 --> 00:24:31,847
I've lost a Graske.

128
00:24:32,203 --> 00:24:34,632
He must have slipped through the portal.
Have you seen him?

129
00:24:35,512 --> 00:24:36,221
Oh!

130
00:24:36,887 --> 00:24:37,717
There he is!

131
00:24:38,438 --> 00:24:40,710
Albert Hall, you've got
a Graske on the loose.

132
00:24:44,594 --> 00:24:46,374
And he's stolen my waterpistol!

133
00:24:47,778 --> 00:24:49,371
Oi! Graske!

134
00:24:49,601 --> 00:24:51,028
Stop it, behave!

135
00:24:51,776 --> 00:24:54,375
He wasn't trying to warn me, he was
trying to find a shortcut to Earth!

136
00:24:54,475 --> 00:24:56,785
If he escapes, he'll go around
the whole planet, causing troubles...

137
00:24:56,998 --> 00:24:58,138
stealing sweets...

138
00:24:58,819 --> 00:24:59,889
making smells...

139
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:01,429
Hold on! Hold on! Hold on!

140
00:25:01,890 --> 00:25:04,140
I'm just gonna reverse
the polarity of the neutron flow

141
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:06,725
and pull that Graske
back into the TARDIS!

142
00:25:08,315 --> 00:25:09,253
It's not fair!

143
00:25:09,913 --> 00:25:10,931
I'll give you not fair!

144
00:25:11,051 --> 00:25:12,915
I'm gonna reverse the teleport
and send you

145
00:25:13,015 --> 00:25:14,824
all the way to the other side
of the galaxy!

146
00:25:20,145 --> 00:25:20,784
Good!

147
00:25:22,343 --> 00:25:23,989
Well, that was fun.

148
00:25:24,719 --> 00:25:25,684
And a little bit mad!

149
00:25:25,784 --> 00:25:28,067
But I've got to close this portal
if I don't want anymore trouble.

150
00:25:28,167 --> 00:25:29,276
It was nice to see you all.

151
00:25:29,677 --> 00:25:31,051
But, one more thing...

152
00:25:32,092 --> 00:25:33,021
Just remember...

153
00:25:33,794 --> 00:25:36,333
Music isn't just orchestras
and popstars

154
00:25:36,548 --> 00:25:39,220
and a bunch of people with albums
and downloads and concerts...

155
00:25:40,062 --> 00:25:41,064
It's you.

156
00:25:42,335 --> 00:25:45,444
'Cause the music of the Spheres
is all around you.

157
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:49,254
When you're on your own,

158
00:25:49,556 --> 00:25:51,904
just close your eyes
and you'll hear it.

159
00:25:53,050 --> 00:25:53,908
Music.

160
00:25:54,206 --> 00:25:55,263
Inside your head.

161
00:25:56,362 --> 00:25:57,958
'Cause everyone's a musician.

162
00:25:58,394 --> 00:25:59,932
Everyone's got a song inside them.

163
00:26:01,447 --> 00:26:02,695
Every single one of you.

164
00:26:04,305 --> 00:26:04,914
Bye.

165
00:26:13,218 --> 00:26:14,967
Attention! Attention!

166
00:26:15,250 --> 00:26:18,927
The Daleks have taken over
the Royal Albert Hall.

167
00:26:19,174 --> 00:26:21,208
This building is surrounded.

168
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:24,212
There is no escape from the Daleks.

169
00:26:24,312 --> 00:26:26,603
Exterminate! Exterminate!

170
00:26:26,703 --> 00:26:28,564
Extermina-a-te!

171
00:26:28,664 --> 00:26:33,219
Move! Move,
or you will be exterminated.

172
00:26:36,759 --> 00:26:37,927
Move!

173
00:26:38,532 --> 00:26:41,173
Move to the platform and conduct.

174
00:26:41,457 --> 00:26:42,202
Move!

175
00:26:42,971 --> 00:26:44,044
Move!

176
00:26:44,536 --> 00:26:46,207
Behave yourself!

177
00:26:48,477 --> 00:26:53,051
We have travelled back in time
and captured Henry Wood.

178
00:26:55,114 --> 00:26:58,761
We will alter the history of the Proms.

179
00:26:59,165 --> 00:27:02,712
There will be only Dalek music.

180
00:27:04,422 --> 00:27:08,437
It is Davros,
creator of the Daleks.

181
00:27:12,476 --> 00:27:15,290
All hail Davros.

182
00:27:24,505 --> 00:27:27,041
All hail Davros.

183
00:27:29,249 --> 00:27:30,411
Welcome...

184
00:27:31,301 --> 00:27:33,767
to my Dalek empire.

185
00:27:37,054 --> 00:27:40,878
This Royal Albert Hall

186
00:27:41,807 --> 00:27:45,296
will become my new palace.

187
00:27:48,684 --> 00:27:53,295
And you humans shall become...

188
00:27:53,730 --> 00:27:56,167
my obedient slaves.

189
00:28:00,531 --> 00:28:01,445
Dalek,

190
00:28:02,714 --> 00:28:06,556
has the conductor been conditioned
to obey your commands?

191
00:28:08,167 --> 00:28:13,032
Yes, Davros.
He will obey or be exterminated.

192
00:28:14,868 --> 00:28:15,713
Excellent.

193
00:28:16,842 --> 00:28:20,728
Let the music of destruction commence.

194
00:28:21,087 --> 00:28:22,307
Conductor...

195
00:28:22,407 --> 00:28:24,110
begin!

196
00:35:22,517 --> 00:35:23,590
Hello!

197
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:31,117
Hello. I'm Catherine Tate,
otherwise known as Donna Noble.

198
00:35:36,215 --> 00:35:41,107
And, er, I don't know about you,
but after Davros and the Daleks,

199
00:35:41,562 --> 00:35:44,602
the soaring voices
of London Philharmonic Choir

200
00:35:44,702 --> 00:35:46,754
and the cries of "Exterminate!",

201
00:35:47,265 --> 00:35:49,219
I'm ready to welcome back
some friends.

202
00:35:50,171 --> 00:35:53,541
Let's hear the music that accompanied
some of the Doctor's companions -

203
00:35:53,983 --> 00:35:57,100
the women who have laughed
with and loved the Doctor

204
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:58,841
and left him broken-hearted.

205
00:35:59,819 --> 00:36:00,757
I know.

206
00:36:03,283 --> 00:36:07,817
Conducted by Ben Foster, here are
Murray Gold's beautiful themes,

207
00:36:08,183 --> 00:36:11,419
The Girl In The Fireplace
and Astrid Peth.

208
00:36:12,303 --> 00:36:14,208
Hello! Someone said hello.

209
00:36:16,132 --> 00:36:21,229
First, let's celebrate the super-temp
from Chiswick, Donna Noble...

210
00:36:26,478 --> 00:36:32,806
..and her adventures with the Doctor,
because poor Donna never can.

211
00:41:04,149 --> 00:41:07,425
In this next sequence, we're
going to be transported to a beach

212
00:41:07,525 --> 00:41:08,957
in a parallel world

213
00:41:09,057 --> 00:41:12,057
called Darlig Ulv Stranden,
otherwise known as...?

214
00:41:13,537 --> 00:41:15,575
Correct, Bad Wolf Bay.

215
00:41:15,771 --> 00:41:18,806
To perform Doomsday,
the BBC Philharmonic,

216
00:41:19,046 --> 00:41:22,617
the London Philharmonic Choir
and conductor Ben Foster

217
00:41:22,888 --> 00:41:25,898
are joined by composer
Murray Gold on keyboards

218
00:41:25,998 --> 00:41:28,236
with vocals by Melanie Pappenheim.

219
00:41:28,659 --> 00:41:31,264
Just before that,
we're off on a journey

220
00:41:31,523 --> 00:41:35,946
to the lost home of the Time Lords:
the planet of Gallifrey.

221
00:50:23,349 --> 00:50:26,214
Not a dry eye in the house,
I should imagine.

222
00:50:28,018 --> 00:50:29,179
Fantastic.

223
00:50:29,665 --> 00:50:33,577
Now, do you know, one of my
favourite days playing Martha Jones

224
00:50:33,677 --> 00:50:36,696
was Monday 25th February, 2008,

225
00:50:36,942 --> 00:50:40,608
which was when we filmed the scene
where the TARDIS flies Earth back home.

226
00:50:41,238 --> 00:50:44,326
At the controls there were
two Doctors, Martha, Donna,

227
00:50:44,426 --> 00:50:47,339
Rose, Captain Jack, Sarah Jane,
Mickey and Jackie,

228
00:50:47,439 --> 00:50:49,727
though Jackie wasn't allowed
to touch any buttons.

229
00:50:51,447 --> 00:50:53,244
The Doctor, so often alone,

230
00:50:53,344 --> 00:50:57,267
really does have the best
ready-made family in the universe.

231
00:50:57,608 --> 00:51:01,967
To celebrate this wonderful family,
their courage and laughter,

232
00:51:02,295 --> 00:51:03,918
here is The Doctor's Theme,

233
00:51:04,018 --> 00:51:06,498
followed by Song Of Freedom.

234
