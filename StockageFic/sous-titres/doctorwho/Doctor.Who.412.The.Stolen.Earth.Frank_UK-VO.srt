1
00:00:05,585 --> 00:00:06,599
It's fine...

2
00:00:08,251 --> 00:00:09,608
Everything's fine.

3
00:00:10,246 --> 00:00:11,846
Nothing's wrong. All fine!

4
00:00:12,497 --> 00:00:14,768
'Scuse me! What day is it?

5
00:00:14,868 --> 00:00:16,820
- Saturday.
- Saturday.

6
00:00:16,994 --> 00:00:17,745
Good.

7
00:00:18,635 --> 00:00:22,150
- Good, I like Saturdays.
- So, I just met Rose Tyler?

8
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:23,182
Yeah.

9
00:00:23,858 --> 00:00:25,660
<i>But she's locked away
in a parallel world.</i>

10
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:26,533
Exactly.

11
00:00:26,633 --> 00:00:28,929
If she can cross from her world,
to your parallel world,

12
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:30,937
the walls of the universe
are breaking down.

13
00:00:31,037 --> 00:00:33,906
Which puts everything in danger,
everything!

14
00:00:35,633 --> 00:00:36,571
But how?!

15
00:01:07,999 --> 00:01:09,030
Thing is, Doctor.

16
00:01:09,848 --> 00:01:13,051
No matter what's happening,
and I'm sure it's bad, I get that,

17
00:01:15,916 --> 00:01:16,461
but...

18
00:01:16,761 --> 00:01:19,910
Rose is coming back.
Isn't that good?

19
00:01:22,189 --> 00:01:22,741
Yeah.

20
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:28,525
- What the hell was that?!
- It came from outside.

21
00:01:36,336 --> 00:01:37,804
But... we're in space.

22
00:01:38,436 --> 00:01:39,725
How did that happen?

23
00:01:40,169 --> 00:01:41,370
<i>What did you do?</i>

24
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:45,631
We haven't moved, we're fixed...

25
00:01:48,358 --> 00:01:50,142
It can't have! No!

26
00:01:52,688 --> 00:01:55,330
The TARDIS is still in the same place.
But the Earth has gone.

27
00:01:57,007 --> 00:01:58,233
The entire planet.

28
00:01:59,722 --> 00:02:00,554
It's gone.

29
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:05,870
FAR ACCROSS THE UNIVERSE...

30
00:02:07,626 --> 00:02:08,659
<i>Right now!</i>

31
00:02:08,923 --> 00:02:12,386
<i>Confirm all stations on line,
can anyone hear me?</i>

32
00:02:12,486 --> 00:02:13,769
<i>Have you got contact...</i>

33
00:02:13,948 --> 00:02:15,150
What was that?

34
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:19,285
Some sort of earthquake, or...

35
00:02:21,268 --> 00:02:22,899
Jalandra, you all right?

36
00:02:24,779 --> 00:02:28,346
Is anyone hurt? We've lost power,
will someone get the lights back on.

37
00:02:28,446 --> 00:02:29,966
DaCosta, see to it right now!

38
00:02:30,836 --> 00:02:35,030
- Suzanne, are you OK?
- Martha.

39
00:02:35,504 --> 00:02:37,587
- Look at the sky.
- Why, what is it?

40
00:02:37,850 --> 00:02:39,639
Just look at the sky!

41
00:02:40,747 --> 00:02:42,893
Whoa! What happened?

42
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:47,380
Was it the Rift?
Gwen, Ianto, you OK?

43
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:49,921
No broken bones.
Slight loss of dignity.

44
00:02:50,083 --> 00:02:52,707
- No change there then.
- The whole city must've felt that...

45
00:02:52,982 --> 00:02:55,303
- the whole of South Wales!
- I'll look outside.

46
00:03:02,889 --> 00:03:04,470
Little bit bigger than South Wales.

47
00:03:07,576 --> 00:03:10,270
Luke, are you all right?

48
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:15,589
Felt like some sort of
cross-dimensional spatial transference.

49
00:03:15,971 --> 00:03:19,431
But it's night! It wasn't night,
it was eight o'clock in the morning...

50
00:03:19,619 --> 00:03:21,150
Mr Smith! I need you!

51
00:03:24,057 --> 00:03:27,079
I wish you'd stop giving that fanfare,
you just tell me what happened?

52
00:03:27,179 --> 00:03:29,732
<i>Sarah Jane,
I think you should look outside.</i>

53
00:03:30,088 --> 00:03:33,013
<i>I think you'll find the visual
evidence most conclusive.</i>

54
00:03:34,125 --> 00:03:35,232
It's gone dark!

55
00:03:35,833 --> 00:03:38,279
It's them aliens, I'll bet my pension!

56
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:41,123
What d'you want this time,
you green swine!

57
00:03:41,223 --> 00:03:41,935
Dad...

58
00:03:42,298 --> 00:03:45,564
Look, you get back inside, Sylvia.
They always want the women!

59
00:03:45,664 --> 00:03:50,110
No, Dad, just look. Oh, my God.
Look at the sky!

60
00:03:53,361 --> 00:03:54,670
That's impossible...

61
00:03:54,864 --> 00:03:56,230
That's just impossible...

62
00:03:58,524 --> 00:03:59,938
It can't be...

63
00:04:17,979 --> 00:04:19,749
Right, now we're in trouble...

64
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:23,397
And it's only just beginning.

69
00:05:11,452 --> 00:05:13,617
But if the Earth's been moved,

70
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:15,506
they've lost the sun!

71
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,052
What about my Mum?

72
00:05:17,715 --> 00:05:20,143
And Grandad? They're dead,

73
00:05:21,795 --> 00:05:23,084
aren't they? Are they dead?

74
00:05:23,184 --> 00:05:25,830
I don't know, Donna, I'm sorry,
I don't know...

75
00:05:27,357 --> 00:05:28,469
That's my family.

76
00:05:29,583 --> 00:05:32,590
- My whole world.
- There's no readings. Nothing.

77
00:05:33,356 --> 00:05:34,507
Not a trace.

78
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:38,390
Not even a whisper.
Oh, that is fearsome technology.

79
00:05:39,835 --> 00:05:41,870
- So what do we do?
- We've got to get help.

80
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:43,914
From where?

81
00:05:45,102 --> 00:05:45,891
Donna...

82
00:05:46,705 --> 00:05:48,801
I'm taking you to the
Shadow Proclamation.

83
00:05:50,231 --> 00:05:51,390
Hold tight!

84
00:05:57,570 --> 00:06:01,988
The United Nations has issued an edict,
asking the citizens of the world

85
00:06:02,088 --> 00:06:03,220
not to panic.

86
00:06:03,647 --> 00:06:04,673
So far,

87
00:06:04,773 --> 00:06:09,270
there has been no explanation of the 26
planets which have appeared in the sky.

88
00:06:09,817 --> 00:06:11,801
But it's an empirical fact!

89
00:06:11,901 --> 00:06:14,785
The planets didn't come to us,
we came to them!

90
00:06:14,885 --> 00:06:16,281
Just look at the stars.

91
00:06:16,381 --> 00:06:20,430
We're in a completely different region
of space, we've travelled.

92
00:06:20,692 --> 00:06:23,607
D'you know what, I look up,
and there's all these moons and things!

93
00:06:23,707 --> 00:06:25,070
Have you seen them?

94
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:29,204
I thought, what was I drinking
last night? Furniture polish?

95
00:06:31,156 --> 00:06:33,110
Ianto. Time and a place.

96
00:06:33,404 --> 00:06:35,751
- He is funny, though.
- Gwen, come and see!

97
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,849
Rhys, I've got no idea,
just stay indoors.

98
00:06:38,949 --> 00:06:41,087
Can you phone my mother,
tell her, erm,

99
00:06:41,546 --> 00:06:44,168
oh, I dunno, just tell her to
take her pills and go to sleep.

100
00:06:46,183 --> 00:06:47,828
I'll come home as soon as I can,

101
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,574
I promise.

102
00:06:50,631 --> 00:06:52,577
I love you, you big idiot.

103
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,631
<i>Someone's established an artificial
atmospheric shell.</i>

104
00:06:55,731 --> 00:06:57,364
<i>Keeping the air and holding the heat.</i>

105
00:06:57,464 --> 00:07:00,242
Whoever's done this wants
the Human Race alive. That's a plus.

106
00:07:01,788 --> 00:07:03,892
<i>27 planets, including the Earth.</i>

107
00:07:06,651 --> 00:07:07,996
No, but what's that?

108
00:07:09,329 --> 00:07:10,605
That's not a planet...

109
00:07:11,093 --> 00:07:13,663
<i>The reading seems to be
artificial in construction.</i>

110
00:07:13,763 --> 00:07:16,947
Some sort of space station.
Sitting at the heart of the web.

111
00:07:17,279 --> 00:07:19,750
They're fine... Maria and her dad,
they're in Cornwall.

112
00:07:19,850 --> 00:07:22,416
I told them to stay indoors.
Clyde's OK, he's with his mum.

113
00:07:22,635 --> 00:07:23,634
Sarah Jane,

114
00:07:23,734 --> 00:07:26,630
I have detected movement.
Observe.

115
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:28,245
Spaceships!

116
00:07:30,635 --> 00:07:32,412
Tracking 200 objects.

117
00:07:32,512 --> 00:07:34,244
Earthbound trajectory!

118
00:07:34,344 --> 00:07:38,748
Geneva is calling a Code Red.
Everyone to battle positions!

119
00:07:39,036 --> 00:07:41,639
Dr Jones, if you're not too busy.

120
00:07:41,739 --> 00:07:43,216
I'm trying to phone the Doctor, sir.

121
00:07:43,316 --> 00:07:44,115
And?

122
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:45,742
There's no signal!

123
00:07:45,992 --> 00:07:49,020
This number calls anywhere
in the universe, it never breaks down.

124
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,478
They must be blocking it.

125
00:07:51,141 --> 00:07:52,530
Whoever 'they' are.

126
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:54,423
We're about to find out.

127
00:07:55,136 --> 00:07:56,470
They're coming into orbit.

128
00:08:18,718 --> 00:08:20,310
The end of the world, darlin'!

129
00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:22,416
End of the stinkin' world!

130
00:08:22,779 --> 00:08:24,086
Have one on me, mate.

131
00:08:36,396 --> 00:08:38,100
Right, you two.

132
00:08:38,312 --> 00:08:41,610
You can put that stuff down,
or run for your lives.

133
00:08:42,511 --> 00:08:43,768
D'you like my gun?

134
00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:52,763
We're now getting confirmed
reports of spaceships.

135
00:08:52,863 --> 00:08:55,272
The Pentagon has issued
an emergency report.

136
00:08:55,466 --> 00:08:57,699
Dad, come and see!

137
00:08:58,390 --> 00:08:59,854
They're saying spaceships!

138
00:09:00,618 --> 00:09:03,902
- Did you find her?
- No, no, there's no reply.

139
00:09:05,135 --> 00:09:06,611
Where are you, Donna?

140
00:09:08,407 --> 00:09:10,127
Where are you, sweetheart?

141
00:09:10,878 --> 00:09:12,455
<i>3,000 miles and closing...</i>

142
00:09:12,724 --> 00:09:13,963
But who are they?!

143
00:09:17,235 --> 00:09:20,816
Martha Jones! Voice of a nightingale!
Tell me you put something in my drink.

144
00:09:20,916 --> 00:09:23,124
No such luck,
have you heard from the Doctor?

145
00:09:23,224 --> 00:09:24,062
<i>Not a word.</i>

146
00:09:24,162 --> 00:09:25,645
- Where are you?
- New York.

147
00:09:26,033 --> 00:09:28,095
- Nice for some.
- I've been promoted.

148
00:09:28,195 --> 00:09:31,386
- Medical Director on Project Indigo.
- D'you get that thing working?

149
00:09:32,862 --> 00:09:35,552
Indigo's top secret,
no-one's supposed to know about it.

150
00:09:35,753 --> 00:09:38,910
- I met a soldier in a bar, long story.
- When was that?

151
00:09:39,010 --> 00:09:41,274
- Strictly professional!
- 1,500 miles, boys,

152
00:09:41,575 --> 00:09:43,721
and accelerating.
They're almost here.

153
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:47,563
<i>I'm receiving a communication
from the Earthbound ships.</i>

154
00:09:47,663 --> 00:09:49,773
<i>They have a message for the human race.</i>

155
00:09:49,873 --> 00:09:51,613
Put it through, let's hear it.

156
00:09:51,770 --> 00:09:55,550
<i>Exterminate! Exterminate!</i>

157
00:09:55,878 --> 00:09:59,588
<i>Exterminate! EXTERMINATE!</i>

158
00:09:59,869 --> 00:10:02,695
<i>Exterminate! Exterminate...</i>

159
00:10:02,889 --> 00:10:03,665
No...

160
00:10:03,765 --> 00:10:05,270
<i>EXTERMINATE!</i>

161
00:10:05,530 --> 00:10:07,087
<i>Exterminate!</i>

162
00:10:07,357 --> 00:10:09,165
- Oh, no.
- What is it?

163
00:10:09,265 --> 00:10:11,059
Who are they?
D'you know them? Jack?

164
00:10:11,159 --> 00:10:15,100
<i>Exterminate, exterminate,</i>

165
00:10:15,732 --> 00:10:19,424
<i>exterminate, exterminate...</i>

166
00:10:20,626 --> 00:10:21,230
No.

167
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:23,260
There's nothing I can do.

168
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,045
I'm sorry. We're dead.

169
00:10:27,145 --> 00:10:29,460
<i>Exterminate, exterminate...</i>

170
00:10:29,623 --> 00:10:31,847
Not Luke. You're so young.

171
00:10:31,947 --> 00:10:35,190
Exterminate, exterminate...

172
00:11:06,972 --> 00:11:09,790
Dalek fleet in battle formation!

173
00:11:10,375 --> 00:11:16,116
- All systems locked and primed!
- Crucible at 90% efficiency!

174
00:11:16,216 --> 00:11:19,169
The Human Harvest will commence!

175
00:11:20,733 --> 00:11:22,061
Battle stations!

176
00:11:22,349 --> 00:11:24,776
Geneva declaring Ultimate Code Red!

177
00:11:25,333 --> 00:11:27,830
Ladies and gentlemen, we are at war!

178
00:11:46,589 --> 00:11:49,350
Supreme Dalek on the Bridge!

179
00:11:52,101 --> 00:11:55,258
Soon, the Crucible will be complete!

180
00:11:55,721 --> 00:11:59,717
We have waited long for this
ultimate destiny.

181
00:11:59,986 --> 00:12:03,870
Now the Daleks are
the masters of Earth!

182
00:12:04,824 --> 00:12:07,646
Daleks are the masters of Earth!

183
00:12:08,309 --> 00:12:11,190
Daleks are the masters of Earth!

184
00:12:15,049 --> 00:12:18,617
So go on then, what is
the Shadow Proclamation anyway?

185
00:12:18,717 --> 00:12:21,895
Posh name for police.
Outer space police. Here we go!

186
00:12:41,213 --> 00:12:44,948
Sco bo tro no flo jo ko fo. To to!

187
00:12:45,048 --> 00:12:49,786
No bo ho sho ko ro to so.
Bo-ko-do-zo-go-bo-fo-po-jo!

188
00:12:54,253 --> 00:12:55,027
Mo ho.

189
00:12:55,728 --> 00:12:58,024
Time Lords are the stuff of legend.

190
00:12:58,693 --> 00:13:01,910
They belong in the myths and
whispers of the Higher Species. You,

191
00:13:02,285 --> 00:13:04,061
cannot possibly exist.

192
00:13:04,374 --> 00:13:07,334
Yeah, more to the point,
I've got a missing planet!

193
00:13:07,434 --> 00:13:10,212
Then you're not as wise
as the stories would say.

194
00:13:10,312 --> 00:13:12,089
<i>The picture is far bigger
than you imagine.</i>

195
00:13:12,189 --> 00:13:14,837
The whole universe
is in outrage, Doctor.

196
00:13:14,937 --> 00:13:19,029
<i>24 worlds have been
taken from the sky.</i>

197
00:13:19,204 --> 00:13:20,024
How many?!

198
00:13:20,706 --> 00:13:22,496
Which ones?! Show me!

199
00:13:24,249 --> 00:13:25,969
Locations range far and wide.

200
00:13:26,370 --> 00:13:29,442
<i>But all disappeared at the exact
same moment. Leaving no trace.</i>

201
00:13:29,542 --> 00:13:31,399
<i>Callufrax Minor. Jahoo.</i>

202
00:13:31,499 --> 00:13:33,610
Shallacatop. Woman Wept...

203
00:13:33,867 --> 00:13:35,875
Clom! Clom's gone!
Who'd want Clom?!

204
00:13:35,975 --> 00:13:37,385
All different sizes,

205
00:13:38,192 --> 00:13:39,600
some populated, some not.

206
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:41,365
But all unconnected.

207
00:13:41,571 --> 00:13:42,772
What about Pyrovillia?

208
00:13:42,872 --> 00:13:44,801
Who is the female?

209
00:13:45,082 --> 00:13:47,334
Donna! I'm a Human Being,

210
00:13:47,981 --> 00:13:49,355
<i>maybe not the stuff of legend</i>

211
00:13:49,455 --> 00:13:51,633
but every bit as important
as Time Lords, thank you.

212
00:13:52,366 --> 00:13:54,100
Way back when we were in Pompeii,

213
00:13:54,369 --> 00:13:56,183
Lucius said Pyrovillia had gone missing.

214
00:13:56,415 --> 00:13:59,499
Pyrovillia is cold case.
Not relevant!

215
00:13:59,599 --> 00:14:01,057
How d'you mean, cold case?

216
00:14:01,157 --> 00:14:03,444
The planet Pyrovillia
can't be part of this,

217
00:14:03,544 --> 00:14:05,233
it disappeared over 2,000 years ago.

218
00:14:05,333 --> 00:14:06,566
Yes, yes, hang on.

219
00:14:06,666 --> 00:14:08,543
<i>But there's the Adipose
Breeding Planet too,</i>

220
00:14:09,137 --> 00:14:10,721
Miss Foster said that was lost,

221
00:14:11,146 --> 00:14:13,030
but that must've been a long time ago.

222
00:14:13,549 --> 00:14:15,820
That's it! Donna! Brilliant!

223
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:18,430
Planets are being taken
out of time as well as space...

224
00:14:19,218 --> 00:14:20,750
Let's put this into 3-D...

225
00:14:21,903 --> 00:14:25,294
<i>Now, if we add Pyrovillia...</i>

226
00:14:27,684 --> 00:14:29,279
And Adipose 3.

227
00:14:32,005 --> 00:14:35,590
Something missing. Where else,
where else? Lost, lost, lost... Oh!

228
00:14:35,803 --> 00:14:37,630
The Lost Moon of Poosh!

229
00:14:45,169 --> 00:14:47,039
- What did you do?
- Nothing.

230
00:14:48,366 --> 00:14:51,270
The planets rearranged themselves
into the optimum pattern.

231
00:14:52,758 --> 00:14:53,993
Oh, look at that!

232
00:14:55,351 --> 00:14:59,286
27 planets in perfect balance.
Come on, that is gorgeous!

233
00:14:59,455 --> 00:15:01,910
Oi, don't get all spaceman,
what does it mean?

234
00:15:02,402 --> 00:15:05,464
All those worlds fit together
like pieces of an engine.

235
00:15:06,339 --> 00:15:07,540
It's like a powerhouse!

236
00:15:08,816 --> 00:15:11,400
- What for?
- Who could design such a thing?

237
00:15:12,076 --> 00:15:14,380
Someone tried to move
the Earth once before.

238
00:15:15,637 --> 00:15:16,945
Long time ago...

239
00:15:19,369 --> 00:15:20,483
can't be...

240
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:24,289
<i>Maximum extermination!</i>

241
00:15:27,235 --> 00:15:30,101
<i>The shields are down!
There's so many, abandon ship. </i>

242
00:15:30,201 --> 00:15:31,277
The Valiant's down.

243
00:15:31,377 --> 00:15:34,298
Airforce retreating over North Africa!
Daleks landing in Japan.

244
00:15:34,398 --> 00:15:37,764
<i>We've lost contact with the Prime
Minister's plane... Jack! Manhattan!</i>

245
00:15:38,396 --> 00:15:41,286
- Martha, get out of there !
- I can't Jack, I've got a job to do.

246
00:15:41,386 --> 00:15:44,148
They're targeting military bases,
you're next on the list!

247
00:15:44,248 --> 00:15:46,881
Dr Jones, you will come with me.

248
00:15:46,981 --> 00:15:49,039
Project Indigo is being activated.

249
00:15:50,228 --> 00:15:51,198
Quick march!

250
00:15:53,817 --> 00:15:55,788
But we can't use Project Indigo,

251
00:15:55,888 --> 00:15:58,710
it hasn't been tested,
sir, we don't even know if it works.

252
00:16:00,271 --> 00:16:03,536
<i>Unit forces will be exterminated.</i>

253
00:16:03,636 --> 00:16:05,500
<i>Annihilate Unit.</i>

254
00:16:12,210 --> 00:16:14,350
Exterminate!

255
00:16:22,166 --> 00:16:24,350
Put it on, fast as you can.

256
00:16:26,214 --> 00:16:29,918
Martha, I'm telling you,
don't use Project Indigo, it's not safe.

257
00:16:30,018 --> 00:16:33,167
You take your orders from UNIT,
Dr Jones, not from Torchwood.

258
00:16:33,523 --> 00:16:34,205
But why me?

259
00:16:34,305 --> 00:16:36,151
You're our only hope
of finding the Doctor.

260
00:16:36,458 --> 00:16:37,603
<i>But failing that,</i>

261
00:16:37,859 --> 00:16:39,461
if no help is coming,

262
00:16:39,636 --> 00:16:41,231
then with the power invested in me

263
00:16:41,331 --> 00:16:43,608
<i>by the Unified Intelligence Taskforce,</i>

264
00:16:43,708 --> 00:16:45,773
I authorise you, to take this:

265
00:16:46,868 --> 00:16:48,138
<i>The Osterhagen Key.</i>

266
00:16:49,959 --> 00:16:51,350
I can't take that, sir.

267
00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:53,179
You know what to do.

268
00:16:53,492 --> 00:16:55,532
For the sake of the Human Race.

269
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:02,449
<i>Daleks one five
reaching north corridor.</i>

270
00:17:02,549 --> 00:17:05,630
- Dr Jones... good luck.
- Exterminate, exterminate...

271
00:17:13,826 --> 00:17:15,252
Exterminate...

272
00:17:15,352 --> 00:17:16,147
Bye, Jack.

273
00:17:16,247 --> 00:17:17,310
Martha, don't do it!

274
00:17:20,730 --> 00:17:21,625
DON'T!!!!

275
00:17:24,816 --> 00:17:26,199
What's Project Indigo?

276
00:17:28,539 --> 00:17:29,804
Experimental teleport.

277
00:17:29,904 --> 00:17:31,713
Salvaged from the Sontarans.

278
00:17:32,338 --> 00:17:34,853
But they haven't got coordinates,
or stabilisation.

279
00:17:35,010 --> 00:17:35,930
So where is she?

280
00:17:37,125 --> 00:17:38,409
Scattered into atoms.

281
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:41,612
Martha's down.

282
00:17:43,290 --> 00:17:45,204
Commence the landings.

283
00:17:45,304 --> 00:17:47,465
Bring the Humans here!

284
00:17:47,565 --> 00:17:51,230
- Prepare the Crucible!
- Supreme Dalek,

285
00:17:51,487 --> 00:17:52,626
<i>is there news?</i>

286
00:17:52,726 --> 00:17:55,030
Earth has been subjugated!

287
00:17:56,025 --> 00:17:59,597
I mean, is there news of him?

288
00:17:59,766 --> 00:18:03,390
<i>Negative! No reports of Time Lord.</i>

289
00:18:03,650 --> 00:18:06,418
We are beyond the Doctor's reach!

290
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:12,077
Fascinating. If I had not elevated
you beyond crude emotions,

291
00:18:12,177 --> 00:18:15,790
<i>I could almost mistake
that tone for one of victory.</i>

292
00:18:16,468 --> 00:18:18,358
Beware your pride.

293
00:18:18,458 --> 00:18:20,679
The Doctor cannot stop us!

294
00:18:21,079 --> 00:18:25,321
And yet, Dalek Caan is uneasy.

295
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:31,195
The Abomination is insane.

296
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:32,503
Show respect.

297
00:18:32,741 --> 00:18:35,881
Without Dalek Caan,
none of this would be possible.

298
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:38,700
<i>And he speaks only the truth.</i>

299
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:41,123
He is coming.

300
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:47,190
The threefold man, he dances
in the lonely places.

301
00:18:47,557 --> 00:18:50,247
<i>Oh, creator of us all.</i>

302
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:53,353
The Doctor is coming...

303
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:20,950
<i>You need sustenance.</i>

304
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:23,561
Take the water. It purifies.

305
00:19:24,488 --> 00:19:25,144
Thanks.

306
00:19:26,101 --> 00:19:27,678
There was something on your back.

307
00:19:29,842 --> 00:19:30,737
How d'you know that?

308
00:19:31,557 --> 00:19:33,079
You are something new.

309
00:19:34,012 --> 00:19:34,820
Not me.

310
00:19:36,290 --> 00:19:37,191
<i>I'm just a temp.</i>

311
00:19:37,829 --> 00:19:40,219
Shorthand, filing,
100 words per minute,

312
00:19:41,270 --> 00:19:42,748
fat lot of good that is now.

313
00:19:43,561 --> 00:19:44,613
I'm no use to anyone.

314
00:19:45,090 --> 00:19:46,815
I'm so sorry for your loss.

315
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,075
Yeah.

316
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:52,590
My whole planet's gone.

317
00:19:53,261 --> 00:19:55,401
I mean the loss that is yet to come.

318
00:19:58,316 --> 00:19:59,255
God save you.

319
00:20:02,521 --> 00:20:04,861
Come on, think, Earth!
Must've been some sort of warning.

320
00:20:04,961 --> 00:20:06,920
Was there anything happening, like,

321
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:10,085
electrical storms, freak weather,
patterns in the sky?

322
00:20:10,185 --> 00:20:11,474
Well, how should I know?

323
00:20:12,225 --> 00:20:13,573
Um... no,

324
00:20:14,374 --> 00:20:15,413
I don't think so, no.

325
00:20:16,295 --> 00:20:18,390
- OK, never mind.
- Although...

326
00:20:20,518 --> 00:20:21,851
there were the bees disappearing.

327
00:20:22,664 --> 00:20:23,830
The bees disappearing...

328
00:20:25,050 --> 00:20:26,645
<i>The bees disappearing.</i>

329
00:20:27,653 --> 00:20:31,000
The bees disappearing.
How is that significant?

330
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:32,777
On Earth we have these insects.

331
00:20:32,877 --> 00:20:35,170
Some people said it was pollution,
or mobile phone...

332
00:20:35,339 --> 00:20:36,496
Or, they were going home!

333
00:20:36,909 --> 00:20:39,406
- Back home where?
- The planet Melissa Majoria!

334
00:20:39,825 --> 00:20:43,623
- Are you saying bees are aliens?!
- Don't be so daft. Not all of them.

335
00:20:43,723 --> 00:20:46,286
But if the migrant bees felt something
coming, and escaped...

336
00:20:46,386 --> 00:20:47,312
Tandocca!

337
00:20:47,412 --> 00:20:48,757
The Tandocca Scale!

338
00:20:48,857 --> 00:20:52,123
It's wavelengths used as
a carrier signal. Infinitely small!

339
00:20:52,223 --> 00:20:55,210
It's like looking for a speck
of cinnamon in the Sahara, but look,

340
00:20:55,310 --> 00:20:57,367
There it is. The Tandocca trail.

341
00:20:58,325 --> 00:21:01,541
The transmat that moved the planets used
the same wavelength, we can follow it!

342
00:21:01,641 --> 00:21:03,471
Find the Earth?!
Stop talking and do it!

343
00:21:03,571 --> 00:21:04,385
I am!

344
00:21:07,657 --> 00:21:08,614
We're a bit late.

345
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:12,756
The signal's scattered.
But it's a start!

346
00:21:15,423 --> 00:21:17,575
I've got a blip! Just a blip!
But definitely a blip!

347
00:21:17,675 --> 00:21:19,965
According to the Strictures
of the Shadow Proclamation,

348
00:21:20,065 --> 00:21:22,881
I will have to seize your
transport and your technology.

349
00:21:22,981 --> 00:21:24,310
Oh, really, what for?

350
00:21:24,592 --> 00:21:26,988
The planets were stolen
with hostile intent.

351
00:21:27,088 --> 00:21:29,985
We are declaring war, Doctor.
Right across the universe.

352
00:21:30,085 --> 00:21:32,725
And you will lead us into battle!

353
00:21:33,582 --> 00:21:35,463
Right, yes,

354
00:21:37,290 --> 00:21:38,241
course I will.

355
00:21:39,148 --> 00:21:40,713
I'll just go and...

356
00:21:42,176 --> 00:21:43,203
get you the key.

357
00:21:50,970 --> 00:21:52,473
Doctor! Come back!

358
00:21:54,970 --> 00:21:57,550
By the Holy Writ
of the Shadow Proclamation,

359
00:21:57,650 --> 00:22:00,327
I order you to stop!

360
00:22:00,427 --> 00:22:03,670
All Humans will leave their homes!

361
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:07,243
The males, the females,

362
00:22:07,343 --> 00:22:10,830
the descendants, you will come with us!

363
00:22:11,090 --> 00:22:13,070
Resistance is useless!

364
00:22:13,387 --> 00:22:17,943
- Where are you taking us?
- Daleks do not answer Human questions!

365
00:22:18,043 --> 00:22:21,593
- Stand in line!
- Dad, please come home.

366
00:22:21,693 --> 00:22:24,304
- They're leaving our street alone.
- Yeah, I've got a weapon!

367
00:22:24,404 --> 00:22:26,556
- It's a paint gun!
- Exactly!

368
00:22:27,088 --> 00:22:29,853
Them Dalek things,
they've only got one eye...

369
00:22:30,191 --> 00:22:32,542
Good splodge of paint,
they'd be blinded!

370
00:22:32,642 --> 00:22:35,004
We're not going! D'you hear me?

371
00:22:35,667 --> 00:22:37,863
Laura, get back inside the house!

372
00:22:38,026 --> 00:22:39,709
Simon! Get inside! Go!

373
00:22:43,023 --> 00:22:44,487
Get back in the sky,

374
00:22:45,244 --> 00:22:47,791
<i>get back where you came from,
and leave us alone!</i>

375
00:22:49,417 --> 00:22:52,194
Dalek attack formation seven.

376
00:22:56,081 --> 00:22:58,877
Maximum extermination!

377
00:23:05,843 --> 00:23:07,964
- They're monsters.
- Please, Dad.

378
00:23:08,064 --> 00:23:09,298
Come home.

379
00:23:13,071 --> 00:23:17,190
- Halt! You will come with me!
- Will I heck!

380
00:23:21,629 --> 00:23:24,482
My vision is NOT impaired!

381
00:23:24,582 --> 00:23:28,393
- I warned you, Dad!
- Hostility will not be tolerated!

382
00:23:28,493 --> 00:23:31,224
Exterminate! Exterminate! Exter...

383
00:23:40,590 --> 00:23:44,200
- Do you want to swap?
- You're Donna Noble's family, right?

384
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:46,665
I'm Rose Tyler. And I need you.

385
00:23:48,767 --> 00:23:50,969
I've tried calling her,
but I can't get through!

386
00:23:51,069 --> 00:23:53,591
But she's still with the Doctor,
I know that much...

387
00:23:53,794 --> 00:23:55,790
and the last time she phoned,

388
00:23:55,959 --> 00:23:58,750
it was from a planet called Midnight,
made of diamonds!

389
00:23:58,850 --> 00:24:00,697
What the hell are you two on about?

390
00:24:00,797 --> 00:24:02,549
Look, she's out there, sweetheart.

391
00:24:02,868 --> 00:24:04,150
Your daughter.

392
00:24:04,607 --> 00:24:08,230
She's travelling the stars,
with that Doctor, she always has been!

393
00:24:08,330 --> 00:24:10,892
- Don't be ridiculous.
- Oh, come on open your eyes!

394
00:24:10,992 --> 00:24:13,451
Look at the sky! Look at the Daleks!

395
00:24:13,551 --> 00:24:16,148
You can't start denying things now!

396
00:24:16,348 --> 00:24:19,134
You were my last hope.
If we can't find Donna,

397
00:24:19,885 --> 00:24:21,255
<i>then we can't find the Doctor...</i>

398
00:24:24,615 --> 00:24:25,950
Where is he?!

399
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,146
It's stopped.

400
00:24:37,946 --> 00:24:38,810
What d'you mean?

401
00:24:40,293 --> 00:24:41,381
Is that good or bad?

402
00:24:42,270 --> 00:24:43,114
Where are we?

403
00:24:43,690 --> 00:24:45,330
The Medusa Cascade.

404
00:24:55,752 --> 00:24:57,385
I came here when I was just a kid.

405
00:24:58,255 --> 00:24:59,462
90 years old.

406
00:25:00,851 --> 00:25:03,542
<i>It was the centre of
a rift in time and space...</i>

407
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:05,143
<i>So...</i>

408
00:25:06,309 --> 00:25:07,870
where are the 27 planets?

409
00:25:08,323 --> 00:25:09,155
Nowhere.

410
00:25:10,494 --> 00:25:12,146
The Tandocca Trail stops dead.

411
00:25:15,944 --> 00:25:17,035
End of the line.

412
00:25:18,587 --> 00:25:19,813
So what do we do?

413
00:25:22,078 --> 00:25:23,836
Doctor? What do we do?

414
00:25:26,130 --> 00:25:27,769
<i>Now don't do this to me.</i>

415
00:25:30,710 --> 00:25:31,786
No, don't,

416
00:25:32,781 --> 00:25:33,790
don't do this to me.

417
00:25:35,252 --> 00:25:36,109
<i>Not now.</i>

418
00:25:37,229 --> 00:25:39,427
Tell me, what are we going do?

419
00:25:42,442 --> 00:25:43,631
You never give up.

420
00:25:45,821 --> 00:25:46,665
Please.

421
00:25:53,796 --> 00:25:56,749
<i>This is the Commander General
of the United Nations</i>

422
00:25:57,012 --> 00:25:58,714
<i>calling the Dalek Fleet.</i>

423
00:25:59,364 --> 00:26:02,654
<i>We surrender, repeat, we surrender.</i>

424
00:26:03,338 --> 00:26:05,270
<i>Planet Earth surrenders.</i>

425
00:26:05,591 --> 00:26:10,830
<i>Humans selected for testing
will follow Dalek instruction...</i>

426
00:26:11,673 --> 00:26:14,125
<i>The Daleks reign supreme.</i>

427
00:26:14,313 --> 00:26:16,609
<i>All hail the Daleks.</i>

428
00:26:17,510 --> 00:26:21,530
<i>You will obey Dalek
instructions without question.</i>

429
00:26:22,199 --> 00:26:24,628
<i>You will obey your Dalek Ma...</i>

430
00:26:31,170 --> 00:26:32,482
<i>Can anyone hear me?</i>

431
00:26:33,718 --> 00:26:35,645
<i>The Subwave Network is open.</i>

432
00:26:35,745 --> 00:26:37,572
<i>You should be able to hear my voice.</i>

433
00:26:39,493 --> 00:26:41,070
<i>Is there anyone there?</i>

434
00:26:41,447 --> 00:26:42,990
I know that voice.

435
00:26:43,730 --> 00:26:46,433
- Who's that?
- Some poor soul calling for help.

436
00:26:46,890 --> 00:26:48,750
- Can anyone...
- There's nothing we can do.

437
00:26:49,079 --> 00:26:50,055
But look at Mr Smith.

438
00:26:50,155 --> 00:26:52,764
<i>Processing incoming soundwave.</i>

439
00:26:52,996 --> 00:26:55,530
<i>This message is of
the utmost importance.</i>

440
00:26:55,630 --> 00:26:56,790
<i>We haven't much time...</i>

441
00:26:58,474 --> 00:26:59,557
<i>Can anyone hear me?</i>

442
00:27:01,133 --> 00:27:02,566
Someone's trying to get in touch.

443
00:27:03,936 --> 00:27:06,150
The whole world's crying out.
Just leave it.

444
00:27:06,558 --> 00:27:09,230
<i>Captain Jack Harkness,
shame on you!</i>

445
00:27:09,719 --> 00:27:11,750
<i>Now stand to attention, sir!</i>

446
00:27:12,662 --> 00:27:13,400
What?!

447
00:27:14,439 --> 00:27:15,413
Who is that?

448
00:27:17,658 --> 00:27:20,274
Harriet Jones,
former Prime Minister.

449
00:27:20,593 --> 00:27:22,313
Yeah, I know who you are.

450
00:27:22,570 --> 00:27:26,250
Harriet! It's me, it's me.
Oh, she can't hear me...

451
00:27:26,350 --> 00:27:27,309
Have you got a webcam?

452
00:27:27,409 --> 00:27:29,470
She wouldn't let me,
said they're naughty.

453
00:27:30,905 --> 00:27:33,440
- I can't speak to her then, can I?
- Sarah Jane Smith,

454
00:27:33,739 --> 00:27:38,670
- 13 Bannerman Road... are you there?
- Yeah. I'm here! That's me!

455
00:27:38,930 --> 00:27:42,150
Good... Now, let's see
if we can talk to each other.

456
00:27:46,433 --> 00:27:49,115
The fourth contact is having
some trouble getting through.

457
00:27:49,215 --> 00:27:51,146
That's me! Harriet! That's me!

458
00:27:51,427 --> 00:27:53,066
I'll just boost the signal...

459
00:27:54,111 --> 00:27:54,910
Hello?

460
00:27:56,157 --> 00:27:57,318
Martha Jones!

461
00:27:57,587 --> 00:27:59,264
Who's she? I want to get through!

462
00:27:59,364 --> 00:28:00,303
Martha, where are you?!

463
00:28:00,403 --> 00:28:02,743
I guess Project Indigo
was more clever than we thought.

464
00:28:02,843 --> 00:28:04,645
One second I was in Manhattan...

465
00:28:06,046 --> 00:28:08,952
<i>Next second...
Maybe Indigo tapped into my mind.</i>

466
00:28:09,052 --> 00:28:11,674
<i>Cos I ended up in the
one place that I wanted to be.</i>

467
00:28:14,764 --> 00:28:15,296
Mum!

468
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:20,265
<i>You came home..</i>

469
00:28:20,728 --> 00:28:22,990
At the end of the world,
you came back to me.

470
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:28,170
But then all of a sudden,
it's like the laptop turned itself on.

471
00:28:28,270 --> 00:28:30,534
It did. That was me.

472
00:28:31,647 --> 00:28:33,493
Harriet Jones,
former Prime Minister.

473
00:28:33,593 --> 00:28:35,536
Yes, I know who you are.

474
00:28:35,636 --> 00:28:38,911
<i>I thought it was about time we all met.
Given the current crisis.</i>

475
00:28:39,011 --> 00:28:41,577
<i>Torchwood, this is Sarah Jane Smith.</i>

476
00:28:41,821 --> 00:28:43,328
I've been following your work.

477
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:45,185
Nice job with the Slitheen.

478
00:28:45,529 --> 00:28:47,681
Yeah, well I've been
staying away from you lot.

479
00:28:47,888 --> 00:28:49,089
Too many guns!

480
00:28:49,590 --> 00:28:50,741
All the same,

481
00:28:51,379 --> 00:28:53,074
might I say, looking good, ma'am.

482
00:28:53,587 --> 00:28:54,934
Really? Oh.

483
00:28:55,285 --> 00:28:56,617
Not now, Captain.

484
00:28:57,199 --> 00:29:00,378
And Martha Jones,
former companion to the Doctor.

485
00:29:00,778 --> 00:29:01,885
Oi! So was I!!

486
00:29:01,985 --> 00:29:03,618
But how did you find me?

487
00:29:04,119 --> 00:29:07,291
<i>This, ladies and gentlemen,
this is the Subwave Network.</i>

488
00:29:07,547 --> 00:29:11,370
A sentient piece of software, programmed
to seek out anyone at everyone

489
00:29:11,589 --> 00:29:13,335
who can help to contact the Doctor.

490
00:29:13,435 --> 00:29:14,999
What if the Daleks can hear us?

491
00:29:15,099 --> 00:29:19,350
No, that's the beauty of the Subwave,
it's undetectable.

492
00:29:19,549 --> 00:29:21,332
And you invented it?

493
00:29:21,432 --> 00:29:25,086
I developed it. It was created
by the Mr Copper Foundation.

494
00:29:25,186 --> 00:29:27,325
<i>Yeah, but what we need, is a weapon!</i>

495
00:29:27,719 --> 00:29:29,909
Martha, back there at UNIT,
what did they give you,

496
00:29:30,009 --> 00:29:31,248
<i>what was that key thing?</i>

497
00:29:32,493 --> 00:29:33,670
The Osterhagen Key.

498
00:29:33,930 --> 00:29:38,082
That key is not to be used, Dr Jones.
Not under any circumstances.

499
00:29:38,949 --> 00:29:40,670
But what is an Osterhagen Key?

500
00:29:40,851 --> 00:29:42,972
Forget about the key
and that's an order.

501
00:29:43,692 --> 00:29:45,423
<i>All we need is the Doctor.</i>

502
00:29:45,748 --> 00:29:49,083
Excuse me, Harriet, but,
if you're looking for the Doctor...

503
00:29:49,183 --> 00:29:51,454
- didn't he depose you?
- He did.

504
00:29:51,922 --> 00:29:54,781
And I've wondering about that for
a long time. Whether I was wrong,

505
00:29:55,332 --> 00:29:57,417
but I stand by my actions, to this day.

506
00:29:57,517 --> 00:29:59,563
Because I knew, I knew that one day,

507
00:29:59,961 --> 00:30:03,630
<i>the Earth would be in danger,
and the Doctor would fail to appear.</i>

508
00:30:04,459 --> 00:30:05,800
I told him so myself.

509
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:06,990
And he didn't listen.

510
00:30:07,090 --> 00:30:08,453
But I've been trying to find him,

511
00:30:08,553 --> 00:30:11,056
he got my phone, on the TARDIS,
but I can't get through.

512
00:30:11,156 --> 00:30:12,962
Nor me, and I was here first!

513
00:30:13,062 --> 00:30:14,711
That's why we need the Subwave.

514
00:30:15,172 --> 00:30:16,423
To bring us all together,

515
00:30:16,523 --> 00:30:19,795
combine forces.
The Doctor's secret army.

516
00:30:20,853 --> 00:30:21,716
Wait a minute...

517
00:30:22,154 --> 00:30:23,674
we boost the signal! That's it!

518
00:30:24,231 --> 00:30:26,727
We transmit that telephone number
through Torchwood,

519
00:30:26,827 --> 00:30:28,390
using all the power of the Rift...

520
00:30:28,490 --> 00:30:29,870
And we've got Mr Smith!

521
00:30:30,243 --> 00:30:32,650
<i>He can link up with every
telephone exchange on the Earth!</i>

522
00:30:32,750 --> 00:30:35,283
<i>Can get the whole world to
call same number, at the same time!</i>

523
00:30:35,383 --> 00:30:37,242
Billions of phones,
calling out, all at once!

524
00:30:37,774 --> 00:30:39,782
Brilliant! Who's the kid?

525
00:30:40,445 --> 00:30:41,390
That's my son!

526
00:30:42,247 --> 00:30:43,404
But, excuse me, sorry,

527
00:30:43,798 --> 00:30:45,758
sorry, hello, Ianto Jones.

528
00:30:46,136 --> 00:30:47,482
If we start transmitting,

529
00:30:47,582 --> 00:30:50,481
then this Subwave Network
is going to become visible.

530
00:30:50,581 --> 00:30:52,039
I mean, to the Daleks.

531
00:30:52,139 --> 00:30:55,791
Yes, and they'll trace it back to me.
But my life doesn't matter.

532
00:30:56,110 --> 00:30:57,306
Not if it saves the Earth.

533
00:30:58,776 --> 00:31:00,670
- Ma'am.
- Thank you, Captain.

534
00:31:01,662 --> 00:31:04,321
But there are people out there dying,
on the streets.

535
00:31:04,759 --> 00:31:06,673
Marvellous woman. I voted for her.

536
00:31:06,936 --> 00:31:07,990
You did not.

537
00:31:08,312 --> 00:31:10,872
Now enough of words. Let's begin!

538
00:31:15,196 --> 00:31:16,492
Rift Power activated!

539
00:31:17,705 --> 00:31:19,226
All terminals coordinated!

540
00:31:28,545 --> 00:31:30,953
National grid online...
giving you everything we've got!

541
00:31:31,936 --> 00:31:33,225
Connecting you to Mr Smith!

542
00:31:33,325 --> 00:31:34,950
All telephone networks combined!

543
00:31:36,982 --> 00:31:38,910
Sending you the number... now!

544
00:31:39,641 --> 00:31:45,590
Opening Subwave Network to maximum.

545
00:31:45,775 --> 00:31:47,064
Mr Smith...

546
00:31:48,297 --> 00:31:51,510
- make that call!
- Calling the Doctor!

547
00:31:52,438 --> 00:31:53,670
So am I!

548
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:58,291
A-a-a-and sending!

549
00:32:20,639 --> 00:32:22,083
- Phone!
- Phone!

550
00:32:23,404 --> 00:32:24,836
Martha, is that you?!

551
00:32:25,629 --> 00:32:26,399
It's the signal!

552
00:32:26,499 --> 00:32:29,264
- Can we follow it?
- Just watch me!

553
00:32:31,610 --> 00:32:35,865
Emergency! Unknown network detected!
Subwave frequency!

554
00:32:35,965 --> 00:32:40,387
Find the point of origin.
Find and exterminate!

555
00:32:40,487 --> 00:32:42,834
<i>I warned you, Supreme One...</i>

556
00:32:43,247 --> 00:32:45,870
Just as Dalek Caan foretold.

557
00:32:46,218 --> 00:32:49,475
The Children of Time
are moving against us.

558
00:32:49,754 --> 00:32:53,408
But everything is falling into place.

559
00:32:59,558 --> 00:33:01,380
I think we've got a fix!

560
00:33:01,650 --> 00:33:03,318
Mr Smith, now at 200%.

561
00:33:07,959 --> 00:33:09,910
Oh, come on, Doctor!

562
00:33:20,482 --> 00:33:21,871
Find me, Doctor.

563
00:33:23,393 --> 00:33:24,532
Find me.

564
00:33:25,631 --> 00:33:27,671
Got it! Locking on!

565
00:33:34,049 --> 00:33:36,426
Harriet! A saucer's locked on
to your location,

566
00:33:36,808 --> 00:33:38,065
they've found you...

567
00:33:38,250 --> 00:33:41,619
I know. I'm using the Network
to mask your transmission. Keep going!

568
00:33:41,719 --> 00:33:43,470
<i>Exterminate!</i>

569
00:33:49,694 --> 00:33:51,389
We're travelling through time.

570
00:33:53,370 --> 00:33:56,857
One second in the future!
The phone call's pulling us through!

571
00:33:59,534 --> 00:34:00,590
Captain,

572
00:34:01,248 --> 00:34:05,870
<i>I'm transferring the Subwave Network
to Torchwood, you're in charge now.</i>

573
00:34:06,566 --> 00:34:08,055
And tell the Doctor from me...

574
00:34:08,875 --> 00:34:10,618
<i>he chose his companions well.</i>

575
00:34:12,288 --> 00:34:13,327
It's been an honour.

576
00:34:22,632 --> 00:34:24,759
Harriet Jones.
Former Prime Minister.

577
00:34:24,859 --> 00:34:27,937
Yes, we know who you are.

578
00:34:29,089 --> 00:34:31,072
Oh, you know nothing of any Human.

579
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:33,149
And that will be your downfall.

580
00:34:35,214 --> 00:34:37,079
<i>Exterminate!</i>

581
00:34:47,170 --> 00:34:50,123
Three! Two! One!

582
00:35:06,414 --> 00:35:07,791
27 planets.

583
00:35:09,374 --> 00:35:10,350
And there's the Earth!

584
00:35:11,933 --> 00:35:13,310
<i>Why couldn't we see them?!</i>

585
00:35:13,944 --> 00:35:15,551
The entire Medusa Cascade

586
00:35:15,651 --> 00:35:18,467
has been put a second out of sync
with the rest of the universe.

587
00:35:18,567 --> 00:35:21,677
Perfect hiding place, tiny little pocket
of time. But we found them!

588
00:35:22,384 --> 00:35:24,947
Ooh, ooh, what's that?

589
00:35:25,829 --> 00:35:27,230
Hold on, hold on,

590
00:35:27,825 --> 00:35:29,670
some sort of Subwave Network...

591
00:35:32,423 --> 00:35:35,301
Where the hell have you been?!
Doctor, it's the Daleks!

592
00:35:35,401 --> 00:35:38,060
- He's nice I thought he'd be older.
- He's not that young.

593
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:40,388
<i>The Daleks are taking people
to their spaceship...</i>

594
00:35:40,801 --> 00:35:42,511
Look, Doctor, I've got a son!

595
00:35:42,611 --> 00:35:44,081
It's not just Dalek Caan!

596
00:35:44,181 --> 00:35:46,290
- That's Donna!
- That's my girl!

597
00:35:46,709 --> 00:35:48,670
Sarah Jane! Who's that boy?

598
00:35:49,293 --> 00:35:50,670
That must be Torchwood.

599
00:35:51,215 --> 00:35:52,350
Aren't they brilliant?

600
00:35:52,610 --> 00:35:54,616
<i>Look at you all, you clever people.</i>

601
00:35:54,917 --> 00:35:58,902
That's Martha. And who's... he?

602
00:35:59,339 --> 00:36:03,230
Captain Jack. Don't. Just... don't.

603
00:36:03,994 --> 00:36:05,289
Doctor, it's me,

604
00:36:06,346 --> 00:36:07,435
I came back.

605
00:36:08,523 --> 00:36:11,086
<i>It's like an outer space Facebook.</i>

606
00:36:11,445 --> 00:36:12,767
Everyone except Rose.

607
00:36:20,787 --> 00:36:22,454
He is here.

608
00:36:23,055 --> 00:36:25,774
The Dark Lord is come.

609
00:36:26,310 --> 00:36:28,557
Supreme One, this Subwave Network,

610
00:36:28,657 --> 00:36:30,709
I would address it, give me access.

611
00:36:33,778 --> 00:36:34,563
We've lost them!

612
00:36:34,663 --> 00:36:36,470
No, no, no, there's another signal.

613
00:36:36,570 --> 00:36:39,323
There's someone else out there.
Hello? Can you hear me?

614
00:36:39,753 --> 00:36:40,450
Rose?

615
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:44,314
<i>Your voice is different. And yet,</i>

616
00:36:45,355 --> 00:36:48,550
its arrogance is unchanged.

617
00:36:49,030 --> 00:36:49,496
No.

618
00:36:51,277 --> 00:36:52,379
But he's dead...

619
00:36:54,116 --> 00:36:57,734
Welcome to my new Empire, Doctor.

620
00:36:58,570 --> 00:37:02,422
It is only fitting that you should bear
witness to the resurrection,

621
00:37:02,522 --> 00:37:05,323
and the triumph, of Davros.

622
00:37:05,423 --> 00:37:09,848
Lord and Creator of the Dalek Race!

623
00:37:12,452 --> 00:37:15,152
- Doctor?
- Have you nothing to say?

624
00:37:16,893 --> 00:37:18,174
Doctor, it's all right.

625
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:21,932
We're in the TARDIS. We're safe.

626
00:37:23,180 --> 00:37:24,287
But you were destroyed.

627
00:37:25,595 --> 00:37:28,236
In the very first year of the Time War.
At the Gates of Elysium.

628
00:37:28,336 --> 00:37:31,320
<i>I saw your command ship fly into
the jaws of the Nightmare Child.</i>

629
00:37:31,852 --> 00:37:33,178
I tried to save you.

630
00:37:33,278 --> 00:37:35,487
But it took one stronger than you.

631
00:37:36,012 --> 00:37:38,070
Dalek Caan himself.

632
00:37:38,437 --> 00:37:41,928
I flew into the wild and fire,

633
00:37:42,050 --> 00:37:46,446
I danced and died a thousand times.

634
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:51,038
Emergency Temporal Shift took
him back into the Time War itself.

635
00:37:51,270 --> 00:37:53,453
That's impossible!
The entire war is timelocked!

636
00:37:53,553 --> 00:37:55,562
And yet he succeeded.

637
00:37:55,662 --> 00:37:58,742
Oh, it cost him his mind.
But imagine,

638
00:37:59,028 --> 00:38:03,026
a single, simple Dalek succeeded where

639
00:38:03,651 --> 00:38:06,510
Emperors and Time Lords have failed.

640
00:38:07,137 --> 00:38:11,830
A testament, don't you think,
to my remarkable creations?

641
00:38:12,330 --> 00:38:14,407
And you made a new race of Daleks?

642
00:38:15,746 --> 00:38:17,506
I gave myself to them.

643
00:38:18,094 --> 00:38:19,515
Quite literally.

644
00:38:20,178 --> 00:38:24,732
Each one grown from a cell
of my own body.

645
00:38:27,719 --> 00:38:29,251
New Daleks.

646
00:38:29,526 --> 00:38:31,750
<i>True Daleks.</i>

647
00:38:32,323 --> 00:38:34,319
I have my children, Doctor.

648
00:38:35,551 --> 00:38:37,813
What do you have, now?

649
00:38:38,583 --> 00:38:39,784
After all this time.

650
00:38:40,372 --> 00:38:42,844
Everything we saw.
Everything we lost.

651
00:38:44,057 --> 00:38:46,670
I have only one thing to say to you...

652
00:38:47,133 --> 00:38:47,965
Bye!

653
00:38:52,119 --> 00:38:53,039
Emergency!

654
00:38:53,139 --> 00:38:56,799
Locate the TARDIS! Find the Doctor!

655
00:38:56,980 --> 00:39:00,909
He will go to the Earth,
to find his precious Human allies!

656
00:39:01,180 --> 00:39:03,144
And death is coming.

657
00:39:03,394 --> 00:39:06,097
Oh, I can see it.

658
00:39:06,197 --> 00:39:11,864
Everlasting death for
the most faithful companion...

659
00:39:11,964 --> 00:39:16,087
Subwave Network rerouted.
New location : Torchwood!

660
00:39:16,187 --> 00:39:21,789
Then exterminate them, at once!
Exterminate Torchwood!

661
00:39:24,429 --> 00:39:25,343
Gwen,

662
00:39:26,406 --> 00:39:28,537
Dalek saucer heading for the Bay.
They've found us.

663
00:39:29,713 --> 00:39:31,310
<i>Martha, open that Indigo device...</i>

664
00:39:31,570 --> 00:39:34,962
Lift the central panel, there's
a string of numbers that change...

665
00:39:35,062 --> 00:39:38,725
<i>The fourth number oscillates between
two digits, tell me what they are.</i>

666
00:39:39,155 --> 00:39:41,952
It's a four, and a nine,
we could never work out what that was.

667
00:39:42,722 --> 00:39:44,192
That's the teleport base code.

668
00:39:44,517 --> 00:39:46,957
And that's all I need,
to get this thing working again!

669
00:39:48,102 --> 00:39:50,599
Oscillating four and nine...

670
00:39:51,506 --> 00:39:52,870
Thank you, Martha Jones!

671
00:39:55,170 --> 00:39:56,096
I've gotta go,

672
00:39:56,690 --> 00:39:57,935
I've gotta find the Doctor,

673
00:39:59,618 --> 00:40:00,657
I'll come back,

674
00:40:02,527 --> 00:40:03,516
I'm coming back.

675
00:40:03,678 --> 00:40:05,349
Don't worry about us! Just go!

676
00:40:06,025 --> 00:40:07,585
- We'll be fine!
- You'd better be.

677
00:40:24,415 --> 00:40:28,380
<i>Exterminate! Exterminate!</i>

678
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:29,547
They're here...

679
00:40:29,647 --> 00:40:31,618
TARDIS heading for Vector 7,

680
00:40:31,780 --> 00:40:34,219
- grid reference 665.
- But there are Daleks out there!

681
00:40:34,319 --> 00:40:38,612
I know, I'm sorry,
but I have got to find the Doctor...

682
00:40:39,384 --> 00:40:42,794
Don't move, don't leave the house,
don't do anything.

683
00:40:42,894 --> 00:40:45,158
<i>I will protect the boy,
Sarah Jane.</i>

684
00:40:46,287 --> 00:40:47,275
I love you.

685
00:40:47,926 --> 00:40:48,827
Remember that.

686
00:41:03,068 --> 00:41:04,583
Control? I need another shift.

687
00:41:04,683 --> 00:41:06,498
Lock me on to the TARDIS... now!

688
00:41:08,193 --> 00:41:10,358
Right, I'm gonna find them.

689
00:41:11,397 --> 00:41:12,310
Wish me luck!

690
00:41:12,625 --> 00:41:14,639
- Oh, good luck.
- Yeah, good luck, sweetheart!

691
00:41:27,257 --> 00:41:28,421
It's like a ghost town.

692
00:41:29,047 --> 00:41:32,231
<i>Sarah Jane said they were
taking the people. What for?</i>

693
00:41:32,331 --> 00:41:35,510
Think, Donna, when you met Rose in
that parallel world, what did she say?

694
00:41:36,074 --> 00:41:38,550
Just... the darkness is coming.

695
00:41:38,971 --> 00:41:39,953
Anything else?

696
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:45,590
Why don't you ask her yourself?

697
00:42:32,299 --> 00:42:34,238
Exterminate!

698
00:42:46,682 --> 00:42:48,541
I've got you, it missed you.

699
00:42:48,641 --> 00:42:49,911
Look, it's me.

700
00:42:50,776 --> 00:42:52,478
- Rose...
- Hi.

701
00:42:53,777 --> 00:42:55,535
- Long time no see...
- Yeah,

702
00:42:56,768 --> 00:42:58,079
been busy, y'know.

703
00:42:59,090 --> 00:43:01,380
Don't die, oh, my God, don't die.

704
00:43:02,700 --> 00:43:04,089
My god, don't die.

705
00:43:06,110 --> 00:43:08,470
Get him into the TARDIS,
quick. Move!

706
00:43:12,091 --> 00:43:15,144
- But they don't work against Daleks!
- Well, I'm going out fighting.

707
00:43:15,319 --> 00:43:17,197
Like Owen... Like Tosh.

708
00:43:18,761 --> 00:43:19,790
How about you?

709
00:43:22,966 --> 00:43:24,117
Yes, ma'am!

710
00:43:27,101 --> 00:43:28,715
<i>What. What do we do?!</i>

711
00:43:29,672 --> 00:43:31,562
There must be some medicine,
or something.

712
00:43:31,831 --> 00:43:33,745
Just step back. Rose!

713
00:43:34,102 --> 00:43:35,541
Do as I say, and get back!

714
00:43:35,785 --> 00:43:37,978
<i>He's dying and you know
what happens next.</i>

715
00:43:38,785 --> 00:43:39,742
What d'you mean?

716
00:43:41,275 --> 00:43:43,252
Oh, no, I came all this way.

717
00:43:43,471 --> 00:43:45,148
What d'you mean? What happens next?

718
00:43:51,418 --> 00:43:52,470
It's starting...

719
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:11,805
All Human transport is forbidden!

720
00:44:11,905 --> 00:44:16,147
- I surrender! I'm sorry!
- Daleks do not accept apologies!

721
00:44:16,247 --> 00:44:18,039
You will be exterminated!

722
00:44:18,214 --> 00:44:20,916
<i>Exterminate! Exterminate!</i>

723
00:44:27,386 --> 00:44:31,290
Exterminate. Exterminate.

724
00:44:35,839 --> 00:44:36,557
Here we go.

725
00:44:37,958 --> 00:44:39,066
Good luck, Doctor!

726
00:44:39,166 --> 00:44:43,249
- Will someone tell me what is going on!
- When he's dying, his body...

727
00:44:43,349 --> 00:44:45,128
it repairs itself. It changes.

728
00:44:45,673 --> 00:44:49,026
- But you can't!
- I'm sorry, it's too late.

729
00:44:51,789 --> 00:44:53,320
I'm regenerating.

730
00:45:36,582 --> 00:45:41,041
