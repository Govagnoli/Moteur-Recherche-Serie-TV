1
00:00:08,278 --> 00:00:08,968
Ow!

2
00:00:11,878 --> 00:00:13,081
Come on! Stop struggling.

3
00:00:13,116 --> 00:00:15,860
You're gonna regret this!
Completely ridiculous!

4
00:00:15,895 --> 00:00:18,460
Get your hands off me! Ah!

5
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:24,105
I think that makes my answer clear.
Don't you?

6
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:28,020
Oh, and, er... If you're gonna
go to print, spell my name right.

7
00:00:28,055 --> 00:00:30,985
Rattigan, with two Ts.

8
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:33,185
Oh, this goes way beyond
the newspapers!

9
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:37,740
This thing's worldwide!
I'm telling you, ATMOS is dangerous.

10
00:00:37,775 --> 00:00:41,437
But if you had proof,
then you wouldn't be here. Fine.

11
00:00:41,472 --> 00:00:45,100
If you won't listen,
I'll find someone else who will.

12
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:53,960
'Welcome. What is your destination?'

13
00:00:53,995 --> 00:00:56,660
Oh, shut up,
you're the last thing I need.

14
00:00:56,695 --> 00:00:59,180
'ATMOS cannot be disabled.'

15
00:00:59,215 --> 00:01:00,785
Right, then.

16
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:03,660
Take me to UNIT headquarters.
Tower Bridge, London.

17
00:01:03,695 --> 00:01:07,497
'UNIT headquarters.'
Her name's Jo Nakashima.

18
00:01:07,532 --> 00:01:10,796
Freelance journalist.
Clever, by the sound of it.

19
00:01:10,831 --> 00:01:14,060
Not as clever as me,
but that goes without saying.

20
00:01:14,095 --> 00:01:16,957
I'd recommend...termination.

21
00:01:16,992 --> 00:01:19,785
Remember your status, boy.

22
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:22,020
We do not take orders from humans.

23
00:01:22,055 --> 00:01:24,705
I said...recommend.

24
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:29,220
Then your advice shows military
wisdom. She will be terminated.

25
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:34,265
Cool.

26
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:37,660
'This is UNIT extension
221...' Not answerphone!

27
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:44,060
Yes, this is a message for
Colonel Mace, from Jo, Jo Nakashima.

28
00:01:44,095 --> 00:01:46,305
Look, you should've got my e-mail.

29
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:50,185
I've been investigating deaths
related to ATMOS systems.

30
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:54,420
'Go straight on.'
I can't prove anything,
but there's got to be a link.

31
00:01:54,455 --> 00:01:58,300
I need you to check out the people
who died in ATMOS cars yesterday -

32
00:01:58,335 --> 00:01:59,657
check out the time.

33
00:01:59,692 --> 00:02:00,980
'Turn right.'

34
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:07,505
I don't believe this.

35
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:10,380
'This is your
final destination.'

36
00:02:10,415 --> 00:02:12,020
I said take me to UNIT!

37
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:16,080
'Go straight on.'
I don't think so.

38
00:02:16,115 --> 00:02:18,980
I'll find my own way, thanks.
ENGINE REVS

39
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:25,880
'This is your final
destination...' No!

40
00:02:25,915 --> 00:02:29,567
'This is your final destination...'
No! Help!

41
00:02:29,602 --> 00:02:33,220
'This is your final destination.'
No! No! No!

42
00:02:33,255 --> 00:02:35,300
NO!

43
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:46,840
I can't believe I'm doing this!

44
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:49,460
No, neither can I. Ooh, careful.

45
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:54,820
Left hand down. Left hand down!

46
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:58,345
You're getting a bit
too close to the 1980s!

47
00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:01,860
What am I gonna do,
put a dent in them? Someone did.

48
00:03:04,155 --> 00:03:05,306
Hold on.

49
00:03:05,341 --> 00:03:07,340
That's a phone!

50
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:12,940
You've got a mobile? Since when?

51
00:03:12,975 --> 00:03:14,220
It's not mine.

52
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:20,180
Hello.

53
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:24,225
Doctor? It's Martha.

54
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:26,660
And I'm bringing you back to earth.

55
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,595

59
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:20,940
Martha Jones.

60
00:04:20,975 --> 00:04:22,540
Doctor.

61
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:37,180
You haven't changed a bit!
Neither have you! How's the family?

62
00:04:37,215 --> 00:04:39,740
You know, not so bad. Recovering.
What about you?

63
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:43,465
Right.

64
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:46,740
I should've known. Didn't take
you long to replace me, then.

65
00:04:46,775 --> 00:04:49,220
Don't fight!
Martha, Donna, Donna, Martha.

66
00:04:49,255 --> 00:04:51,217
Please don't fight,
I can't bear it.

67
00:04:51,252 --> 00:04:53,145
You wish!
I've heard all about you.

68
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:55,740
He talks about you all the time.
I dread to think.

69
00:04:55,775 --> 00:04:57,785
No, no, no, no. He says nice things!

70
00:04:57,820 --> 00:05:00,420
Good things! Nice things.
Really good things.

71
00:05:00,455 --> 00:05:01,945
He's told you everything!

72
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:04,580
Didn't take you long
to get over it, though.

73
00:05:04,615 --> 00:05:06,660
Who's the lucky man?
Lucky what?

74
00:05:06,695 --> 00:05:08,345
She's engaged, you prawn.

75
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:11,025
Really? Who to?
Tom, that Tom Milligan.

76
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:13,945
He's in paediatrics,
working out in Africa right now.

77
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:18,740
I know - a doctor who disappears off
to distant places. Tell me about it.
Is he skinny?

78
00:05:18,775 --> 00:05:21,905
No, he's sort of...strong.

79
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:25,660
HE is too skinny for words! You
give him a hug, you get a paper cut!

80
00:05:25,695 --> 00:05:28,580
Oh! I'd rather you were fighting!
Speaking of which...

81
00:05:28,615 --> 00:05:31,065
'Dr Jones, come in. Over.'
This is Doctor Jones.

82
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:35,500
Operation Blue Sky is go, go, go.
I repeat, this is a go!

83
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:47,180
Unified Intelligence Taskforce!
Raise that barrier now!

84
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:59,465
Leave your safeties on, lads,
it's non-hostiles.

85
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:02,540
Workers,
lay down your tools and surrender.

86
00:06:02,575 --> 00:06:04,105
Greyhound Six to Trap One.

87
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:07,700
B Section, go, go, go! Search the
ground floor, grid pattern Delta.

88
00:06:07,735 --> 00:06:10,220
What are you searching for?
Illegal aliens.

89
00:06:10,255 --> 00:06:12,625
This is a UNIT operation!

90
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:17,540
All workers lay down your
tools and surrender immediately.

91
00:06:17,575 --> 00:06:19,225
This is a UNIT operation!

92
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:22,620
B Section mobilised!
E Section, F Section, on my command!

93
00:06:22,655 --> 00:06:24,817
Is that what you did to her?

94
00:06:24,852 --> 00:06:26,980
Turned her into a soldier?

95
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:34,380
As predicted. The UNIT forces have
moved to the penultimate stage.

96
00:06:34,415 --> 00:06:37,620
Observe their troops. Thin fabrics.

97
00:06:37,655 --> 00:06:40,425
Exposed skin. Feeble weapons.

98
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:43,540
These are toy soldiers!
The playthings of children!

99
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:52,905
And you're qualified now?

100
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:56,220
UNIT rushed it through, given my
field experience. Here we go.

101
00:06:56,255 --> 00:06:58,700
We're establishing
a field base on site.

102
00:06:58,735 --> 00:07:00,857
They're dying to meet you.

103
00:07:00,892 --> 00:07:02,980
Wish I could say the same.

104
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:07,705
Operation Blue Sky complete, sir.

105
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:12,020
Thanks for letting me take the lead.
And this...is the Doctor.

106
00:07:12,055 --> 00:07:15,105
Doctor, Colonel Mace. Sir!

107
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:18,580
Oh, don't salute.
But it's an honour, sir.
I've read all the files.

108
00:07:18,615 --> 00:07:21,660
Technically, you're still
on staff. You never resigned.

109
00:07:21,695 --> 00:07:23,665
What, you used to work for them?

110
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:26,825
Yeah, long time ago.
Back in the '70s.

111
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:30,220
Or was it the '80s? It was all
a bit more homespun back then.

112
00:07:30,255 --> 00:07:33,580
Times have changed, sir.
Yeah, that's enough of the "sir".

113
00:07:33,615 --> 00:07:36,105
Doctor, you've been
on board the Valiant.

114
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:41,100
We've got massive funding from
the United Nations. All in the name
of homeworld security.

115
00:07:41,135 --> 00:07:43,357
A modern UNIT for the modern world.

116
00:07:43,392 --> 00:07:45,666
Arresting ordinary factory workers?

117
00:07:45,701 --> 00:07:47,905
In the street? In broad daylight?

118
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:51,300
It's like Guantanamo Bay out there.
Donna, by the way.

119
00:07:51,335 --> 00:07:54,660
Donna Noble, since you didn't ask.
I'll have a salute.

120
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:58,800
Ma'am.

121
00:07:58,835 --> 00:08:00,465
Thank you.

122
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:02,745
So tell me.
What's going on in that factory?

123
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:05,760
Yesterday, 52 people died
in identical circumstances.

124
00:08:05,795 --> 00:08:08,705
Right across the world,
in 11 different time zones.

125
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:13,700
5am in the UK, 6am in France,
8am in Moscow, 1pm in China...

126
00:08:13,735 --> 00:08:15,145
Simultaneously?

127
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:19,300
Exactly. 52 deaths, at the exact
same moment, worldwide.

128
00:08:19,335 --> 00:08:21,625
How?
They were all inside their cars.

129
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:24,380
Poisoned. I checked
the biopsies, no toxins.

130
00:08:24,415 --> 00:08:27,065
Whatever it is,
left the system immediately.

131
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:30,500
What have the cars got in common?
They're all fitted with ATMOS.

132
00:08:30,535 --> 00:08:32,065
And that is the ATMOS factory.

133
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:34,665
What's ATMOS?
Oh, come on. Even I know that.

134
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:38,920
Everyone's got ATMOS! Stands
for Atmospheric Omission System.

135
00:08:38,955 --> 00:08:43,140
Fit ATMOS in your car, it reduces
CO2 emissions to zero. Zero?!

136
00:08:43,175 --> 00:08:45,265
No carbon, none at all?

137
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:49,500
Sat-nav and 20 quid in shopping
vouchers if you introduce a friend.
Bargain!

138
00:08:49,535 --> 00:08:52,697
And this is where they make it,
Doctor. Shipping worldwide.

139
00:08:52,732 --> 00:08:55,825
17 factories worldwide,
but this is the central depot -

140
00:08:55,860 --> 00:09:02,620
sending ATMOS to every country on
earth. And you think ATMOS is alien?

141
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:07,665
SOLDIER: Come on, look lively.

142
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:10,460
Up the pace.
We haven't got all day now!

143
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:13,865
And here it is, laid bare.

144
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:17,100
ATMOS can be threaded through
any and every make of car.

145
00:09:17,135 --> 00:09:19,865
You must've checked it.
We did, we found nothing.

146
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:23,420
That's why I thought we needed
an expert. Really, who did you get?

147
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:29,300
Oh, right! Me! Yes! Good.

148
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:36,860
OK, so why would aliens be so keen
on cleaning up our atmosphere?

149
00:09:36,895 --> 00:09:38,625
Very good question.

150
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:40,385
Maybe they want to help.

151
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:43,305
Get rid of pollution and stuff.

152
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:46,620
Do you know how many cars
there are on planet earth?

153
00:09:46,655 --> 00:09:48,237
800 million.

154
00:09:48,272 --> 00:09:49,820
Imagine that.

155
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:55,060
If you could control them,
you'd have 800 million weapons.

156
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:02,665
We should head back.

157
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:07,140
There's not much down here. Should
be just boiler rooms, generators.

158
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:12,145
Aye, aye.

159
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:13,620
What's this, then?

160
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:22,660
You two. All personnel have
been ordered to evacuate.
The building's under UNIT control.

161
00:10:22,695 --> 00:10:25,620
This area is out of bounds.
Excuse me, sunshine?

162
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:29,420
I think you'll find we're in charge.

163
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:33,940
We can do this the easy way...

164
00:10:33,975 --> 00:10:35,620
or the hard way.

165
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:38,585
General Staal. They are close.

166
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:40,825
Excellent! And like a good warrior,

167
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:43,660
I shall enter the fray myself!
Let them pass.

168
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:57,340
Come on.

169
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:15,940
What the hell?

170
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:21,825
Greyhound 16 to Trap One.

171
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:27,220
We've found something. Basement
corridor, north side, grid 36.

172
00:11:27,255 --> 00:11:29,637
Request backup, over.

173
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:36,740
It's like something boiling...

174
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:42,985
Don't touch it! Come on, Steve!

175
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:45,700
We get first rights on this.
That means promotion!

176
00:11:45,735 --> 00:11:47,797
Just leave it alone!

177
00:11:47,832 --> 00:11:49,926
Wait for back up.

178
00:11:49,961 --> 00:11:52,020
What was that?

179
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:56,100
Came from inside.

180
00:11:57,540 --> 00:11:59,420
Could just be the machinery.

181
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:13,020
Is there someone in there? Hello?

182
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:16,665
We've got to get this open.

183
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:19,220
We should wait!
You could suffocate in there!

184
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:24,420
Greyhound 16 to Trap One,
request immediate assistance.

185
00:12:24,455 --> 00:12:26,657
Repeat, immediate assistance, over.

186
00:12:26,692 --> 00:12:28,860
How do you work this thing? Come on!

187
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:43,620
Oh, God, it stinks!

188
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:47,540
What the hell is that stuff?

189
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:58,620
Identify yourself! Identify!

190
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:03,180
Greyhound 16 declaring
absolute emergency, sir.

191
00:13:03,215 --> 00:13:06,025
Repeat, absolute emergency, over!

192
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:09,820
Can you hear me?
Can you understand me?

193
00:13:09,855 --> 00:13:12,345
Look at its neck.

194
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:14,700
It's like...an umbilical cord.

195
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:17,780
Well, don't get too close.

196
00:13:17,815 --> 00:13:19,740
I think it's harmless.

197
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:23,860
I don't even think
it's properly alive.

198
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:27,620
It's gonna drown. No...

199
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:31,185
I think it breathes this stuff.

200
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:34,140
Like some kind of embryo.
What do you mean, an embryo?

201
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:38,660
Someone's growing a body.

202
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:44,385
A human body.
Excellent skills of deduction.

203
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:47,580
I would rate you above average,
soldier. Well done.

204
00:13:47,615 --> 00:13:51,505
Whereas you,
you smell of sweat and fear.

205
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:56,185
Yeah? Well, we're not the ones who
got out of school early, sonny.

206
00:13:56,220 --> 00:14:01,460
Stop playing Humpty Dumpty
and tell us who you are.
Is that a reference to my height?

207
00:14:01,495 --> 00:14:04,425
Short answer, yes. A pity.

208
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:08,700
Words are the weapons of womenfolk.
I must judge you unfit!

209
00:14:08,735 --> 00:14:12,500
Oh! What you gonna do,
bite our ankles?

210
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:19,340
I'm warning you!
A proper soldier gives no warning!

211
00:14:19,375 --> 00:14:21,060
Fire! I order you! Fire!

212
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:26,060
The room is contained within
a Cordolaine signal,

213
00:14:26,095 --> 00:14:28,385
exciting the copper surface
of the bullet

214
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:33,380
and causing expansion within the
barrel, rendering your guns useless.

215
00:14:33,415 --> 00:14:38,020
And your radio signals
have been blocked. Agh!

216
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:44,820
My legs! I can't feel my legs!

217
00:14:44,855 --> 00:14:47,460
I apologise for disabling you.

218
00:14:47,495 --> 00:14:49,385
Death has more honour,

219
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:52,420
but you are needed
for the stratagem.

220
00:14:52,455 --> 00:14:54,825
Prepare them for processing.

221
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:58,180
You spoke of promotion.
Now you will serve a greater cause.

222
00:14:58,215 --> 00:15:03,545
But...who are you?
Indeed, know your enemy!

223
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:06,980
I am General Staal of the
10th Sontaran Battle Fleet.

224
00:15:07,015 --> 00:15:08,860
Known as Staal the Undefeated!

225
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:14,060
Help us!

226
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:16,465
Oh, my God, help us!

227
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:21,700
Ionising nano membrane
carbon dioxide converter -
which means that ATMOS works.

228
00:15:21,735 --> 00:15:23,545
Filters CO2 at a molecular level.

229
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:26,340
We know all that,
but what's its origin? Is it alien?

230
00:15:26,375 --> 00:15:28,225
No. Decades ahead of its time.

231
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:31,940
Do you mind? Could you stand back?
Have I done something wrong?

232
00:15:31,975 --> 00:15:35,620
I don't like people with
guns hanging around me, all right?

233
00:15:35,655 --> 00:15:37,140
If you insist.

234
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:43,385
Tetchy.
Well, it's true. He's a good man.

235
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:46,780
People with guns are usually
the enemy, in my books.

236
00:15:46,815 --> 00:15:49,477
You seem at home.
You got me used to fighting.

237
00:15:49,512 --> 00:15:52,140
Oh, right, so it's my fault.
You got me the job!

238
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:54,220
Besides, look at me.

239
00:15:56,380 --> 00:15:58,940
Am I carrying a gun? Suppose not.

240
00:15:58,975 --> 00:16:00,385
It's all right for you.

241
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:04,060
You can just come and go, but
some of us have got to stay behind.

242
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:07,277
I've got to work from the inside
and by staying inside,

243
00:16:07,312 --> 00:16:10,460
maybe I stand a chance
of making them better. Yeah?

244
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:16,980
That's more like Martha Jones.
I learned from the best.

245
00:16:17,015 --> 00:16:18,785
Well... Oi, you lot!

246
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:21,780
All your storm troopers
and your sonics...

247
00:16:21,815 --> 00:16:23,797
Rubbish! You should've come with me.

248
00:16:23,832 --> 00:16:25,745
Why, where have you been? Personnel.

249
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:28,945
That's where the weird stuff's
happening - paperwork.

250
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:32,660
I worked as a temp for years -
I can find my way
round an office blindfold,

251
00:16:32,695 --> 00:16:35,497
and the first thing
I noticed is an empty file.

252
00:16:35,532 --> 00:16:38,300
Why, what's inside it?
Or what's not inside it?

253
00:16:38,335 --> 00:16:40,185
Sick days -

254
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:45,220
there aren't any. Hundreds of people
working here and no one's sick -

255
00:16:45,255 --> 00:16:49,420
not one hangover, man flu,
sneaky little shopping trip, nothing

256
00:16:49,455 --> 00:16:51,700
Not ever! They don't get ill.

257
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:53,745
That can't be right.

258
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:56,380
You've been checking out
the building -

259
00:16:56,415 --> 00:16:58,980
should've been
checking out the workforce.

260
00:16:59,015 --> 00:17:01,020
I can see why he likes you. Mm-hmm.

261
00:17:01,055 --> 00:17:03,185
You are good. Super temp!

262
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:06,900
Doctor Jones, set up a medical post,
start examining the workers.

263
00:17:06,935 --> 00:17:10,220
I'll get them sent through.
Come on, Donna. Gimme a hand.

264
00:17:10,255 --> 00:17:13,700
So, this ATMOS thing -
where did it come from?

265
00:17:13,735 --> 00:17:15,037
Luke Rattigan himself.

266
00:17:15,072 --> 00:17:16,340
And himself would be?

267
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:19,105
Child genius.

268
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:24,020
Invented the Fountain Six search
engine when he was 12 years old.
Millionaire overnight.

269
00:17:24,055 --> 00:17:25,705
Now runs the Rattigan Academy -

270
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:29,900
a private school, educating students
hand picked from all over the world.

271
00:17:29,935 --> 00:17:33,940
A hot-house for geniuses wouldn't
mind going there. I get lonely.

272
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:45,540
Do you think I should warn my mum...
about the ATMOS in her car?

273
00:17:45,575 --> 00:17:48,860
Better safe than sorry.
I'll give her a call.

274
00:17:48,895 --> 00:17:50,905
Donna.

275
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:53,865
Do they know where
you are, your family?

276
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:56,740
I mean, that you're travelling
with the Doctor?

277
00:17:56,775 --> 00:17:58,625
Not really.

278
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:07,500
Although my grandad
sort of waved us off,
but I didn't have time to explain.

279
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:11,220
I didn't tell my family,

280
00:18:11,255 --> 00:18:13,345
kept it all so secret,

281
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:15,305
and it almost destroyed them.

282
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:19,860
In what way? They ended up
imprisoned, they were tortured.

283
00:18:19,895 --> 00:18:22,857
My mum, my dad, my sister.

284
00:18:22,892 --> 00:18:25,296
It wasn't the Doctor's fault,

285
00:18:25,331 --> 00:18:27,665
but you need to be careful.

286
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:31,780
Cos you know the Doctor,
he's wonderful, he's brilliant,

287
00:18:31,815 --> 00:18:33,940
but he's like fire.

288
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:37,980
Stand too close
and people get burned.

289
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:48,105
Conditioning is complete.

290
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:52,420
Now do your duty
and advance the conquest.

291
00:18:52,455 --> 00:18:53,900
Yes, sir.

292
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:01,440
General Staal returning.

293
00:19:01,475 --> 00:19:04,100
The stratagem advances.

294
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:10,180
The last days of planet earth.

295
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:16,140
You are not coming with me!
I want to talk to Luke Rattigan,
not point a gun at him.

296
00:19:16,175 --> 00:19:18,837
It's ten miles outside London.
Then get me a Jeep!

297
00:19:18,872 --> 00:19:21,500
According to the records,
you travel by TARDIS.

298
00:19:21,535 --> 00:19:23,105
If there are hostile aliens,

299
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:26,025
it's best to keep
a super-duper time machine safe.

300
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:29,545
So you do have weapons, but you
choose to keep them hidden. Jenkins!

301
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:33,665
Sir. You will accompany the Doctor
and take orders from him!
I don't do orders.

302
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:38,580
Any sign of trouble, get Jenkins
to declare a Code Red and good luck,
sir. I said no salutes.

303
00:19:38,615 --> 00:19:40,305
Now you're giving orders.

304
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:43,100
You're getting
a bit cheeky, you are. Doctor...

305
00:19:43,135 --> 00:19:45,345
Just in time!
We're going to the country.

306
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:47,980
Fresh air and geniuses -
what more could you ask?

307
00:19:48,015 --> 00:19:49,300
I'm not coming with you.

308
00:19:49,335 --> 00:19:51,345
I've been thinking.

309
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:54,300
I'm sorry. I'm going home.

310
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:58,460
Really? I've got to.

311
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:03,380
Well, if that's what you want.

312
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:07,505
I mean, it's a bit soon.

313
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:09,900
I had so many places
I wanted to take you.

314
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:14,540
The Fifteenth Broken Moon
of the Medusa Cascade,

315
00:20:14,575 --> 00:20:17,717
the Lightning Skies
of Cotter Palluni's World,

316
00:20:17,752 --> 00:20:20,860
the Diamond Coral Reefs
of Kataa Flo Ko...

317
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:26,860
Thank you.

318
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:30,600
Thank you, Donna Noble.

319
00:20:30,635 --> 00:20:32,025
It's been brilliant.

320
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:35,700
You saved my life, in so many ways.

321
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:38,705
You're...

322
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:43,340
You're just popping home
for a visit, that's what you mean.

323
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:44,905
You dumbo.

324
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:47,180
Then you're coming back.
Know what you are?

325
00:20:47,215 --> 00:20:50,317
A great big, outer-space dunce.

326
00:20:50,352 --> 00:20:53,385
Yeah. Ready when you are, sir!

327
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:57,060
What's more, you can give me a lift.
Come on!

328
00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:00,980
Broken moon of what? I know, I know!

329
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:09,385
And your name's Treppa, yeah?
Is that Polish?

330
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:13,380
We're not checking passports, but did
you come from Poland just to work?

331
00:21:13,415 --> 00:21:16,665
I came to do my job. OK.

332
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:18,560
I need to listen to your heartbeat.

333
00:21:18,595 --> 00:21:20,420
This might be a bit cold. Lift.

334
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:34,260
Are you on any medication?
I'm here to work.

335
00:21:34,295 --> 00:21:35,980
How many hours a day do you work?

336
00:21:36,015 --> 00:21:38,940
24. You work 24 hours a day?

337
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:42,265
Down.

338
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:45,020
Mr Treppa, have you ever
had any form of hypnosis?

339
00:21:45,055 --> 00:21:47,060
I'm here to work.

340
00:21:47,095 --> 00:21:49,225
OK. Um...

341
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:51,700
If you could just wait here...

342
00:21:57,060 --> 00:22:00,745
Doctor Jones.
Not now, I'm busy. Just one question.

343
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:03,825
Do you have security clearance
level one? Yes, I do. Why?

344
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:07,900
Colonel Mace wants to see you.
Oh, good, cos I want to see him.
Where is he?

345
00:22:07,935 --> 00:22:09,220
Come with us.

346
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:23,820
I'll see you back
at the factory, yeah? Bye!

347
00:22:23,855 --> 00:22:25,300
And you be careful!

348
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:45,820
Haven't seen you for days.

349
00:22:45,855 --> 00:22:47,260
Been away.

350
00:22:57,020 --> 00:22:59,940
Hold on! I am!

351
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:21,980
I'm waving at fat.

352
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:13,100
Why's he down here?
He asked to see you.

353
00:24:13,135 --> 00:24:14,380
Has he found something?

354
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:40,785
I said so, didn't I? Aliens!

355
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:44,740
I said they was real! I just didn't
expect them in a little blue box.

356
00:24:44,775 --> 00:24:46,345
It's bigger on the inside.

357
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:51,020
Yeah, but is it safe?
This Doctor, are you safe with him?

358
00:24:51,055 --> 00:24:55,785
He's amazing, Gramps.
He's just...dazzling.

359
00:24:55,820 --> 00:24:59,380
And never tell him I said that.
No. But I'd trust him with my life.

360
00:24:59,415 --> 00:25:02,620
Hold up! I thought that was my job!
You still come first.

361
00:25:02,655 --> 00:25:04,700
For God's sake,
don't tell your mother!

362
00:25:04,735 --> 00:25:06,305
I dunno.

363
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:08,785
I mean, this is massive.

364
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:13,020
It's sort of not fair if she doesn't
know. Doesn't know what?

365
00:25:13,055 --> 00:25:14,825
And who's she, the cat's mother?

366
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:19,380
And where've you been
these past few days, lady,
after that trick with the car keys?

367
00:25:19,415 --> 00:25:21,620
Veena said
she hadn't seen hide nor hair.

368
00:25:21,655 --> 00:25:24,037
I've just been...travelling.

369
00:25:24,072 --> 00:25:26,385
Oh, hark at her - Michael Palin!

370
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:28,665
Are you having tea?
I haven't got anything.

371
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:31,940
I've been trying to keep your
grandad on that macrobiotic diet,

372
00:25:31,975 --> 00:25:35,145
but he sneaks off and gets pork pies
at the petrol station.

373
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:39,300
Don't deny it. I've seen the wrappers
in the car. I don't miss a trick!

374
00:25:39,335 --> 00:25:42,180
Now then, what were you gonna
tell me? What don't I know?

375
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:49,825
Nothing. Just...nothing.

376
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:53,420
Good. Right then, you can sit
there and cut out those coupons.

377
00:25:53,455 --> 00:25:56,980
Every penny helps. This new
mortgage doesn't pay for itself.

378
00:25:57,015 --> 00:25:58,700
Dad, kettle on. Yeah, kettle on.

379
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:04,060
UNIT's been watching
the Rattigan Academy for ages.

380
00:26:04,095 --> 00:26:05,585
It's all a bit Hitler Youth -

381
00:26:05,620 --> 00:26:08,420
exercise at dawn
and classes and special diets.

382
00:26:08,455 --> 00:26:09,625
'Turn left.'

383
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:12,700
Ross, one question.
If UNIT think that ATMOS is dodgy...

384
00:26:12,735 --> 00:26:14,545
How come it's in the Jeeps? Yeah.

385
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:18,180
Tell me about it. It's standard
in all government vehicles.

386
00:26:18,215 --> 00:26:20,940
We can't get rid of them
till we can prove something.

387
00:26:20,975 --> 00:26:23,060
'Turn right.'
Drives me round the bend.

388
00:26:23,095 --> 00:26:24,025
Oh, nice one!

389
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:25,940
I timed that perfectly. Yeah.

390
00:26:25,975 --> 00:26:27,985
Yeah, you did.

391
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:30,860
'This is your final destination.'

392
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:45,820
Is it PE?
I wouldn't mind a kick around.

393
00:26:45,855 --> 00:26:47,385
I've got my daps on.

394
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:49,705
Suppose you're the Doctor. Hello.

395
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:51,945
Your commanding officer
phoned ahead.

396
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:55,200
Ah, but I haven't got a commanding
officer. Have you?

397
00:26:55,235 --> 00:26:58,385
Oh, this is Ross. Say hello, Ross.
Afternoon, sir.

398
00:26:58,420 --> 00:27:01,460
Let's have a look, then.
I can smell genius! In a good way.

399
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:08,025
Oh, now!

400
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:10,545
That's clever, look!

401
00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:13,180
Single molecule fabric -
how thin is that?

402
00:27:13,215 --> 00:27:15,140
You could pack a tent in a thimble!

403
00:27:15,175 --> 00:27:17,060
Ooh! Gravity simulators.

404
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:23,820
Terraforming, biospheres,
nano tech steel construction.

405
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:29,820
This is brilliant! Do you know,
with equipment like this,
you could, ooh, I don't know...

406
00:27:29,855 --> 00:27:31,860
move to another planet
or something...

407
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:35,120
If only that was possible.

408
00:27:35,155 --> 00:27:37,265
If only that WERE possible.

409
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:42,100
Conditional clause.
I think you'd better come with me.

410
00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:48,305
You're smarter than the usual
UNIT grunts, all right.

411
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:51,540
He called you a grunt!
Don't call Ross a grunt. He's nice!

412
00:27:51,575 --> 00:27:54,697
We like Ross. Look at this!
What exactly do you want?

413
00:27:54,732 --> 00:27:57,820
I was just thinking,
what a responsible 18-year-old!

414
00:27:57,855 --> 00:28:01,020
Inventing zero-carbon cars,

415
00:28:01,055 --> 00:28:03,785
saving the world...

416
00:28:03,820 --> 00:28:05,825
Takes a man with vision.

417
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:09,745
But ATMOS means more people driving.
More cars, more petrol -

418
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:13,740
the oil will run out faster. The
ATMOS system could make it worse.

419
00:28:13,775 --> 00:28:14,945
See, that's tautology.

420
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:16,585
You can't say "ATMOS system" -

421
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:18,945
it stands for
Atmospheric Omission System,

422
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:22,140
so you're saying "Atmospheric
Omission System system".

423
00:28:22,175 --> 00:28:23,825
See, Mr "Conditional Clause"?

424
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:27,220
It's been a long time since anyone
said no to you, hasn't it?

425
00:28:27,255 --> 00:28:28,905
I'm still right though.

426
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:31,420
Not easy, is it, being clever?

427
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:37,100
You look at the world and you
connect things, random things.

428
00:28:37,135 --> 00:28:39,860
You think,
"Why can't anyone else see it?"

429
00:28:39,895 --> 00:28:42,397
The rest of the world is so slow.

430
00:28:42,432 --> 00:28:44,900
Yeah. You're all on your own.

431
00:28:44,935 --> 00:28:46,465
I know.

432
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:49,985
But not with this! There's no way
you invented this single-handed.

433
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:55,340
Earth technology, but like finding
a mobile phone in the Middle Ages.
No, I'll tell you what it's like -

434
00:28:55,375 --> 00:28:58,020
it's like finding THIS
in someone's front room,

435
00:28:58,055 --> 00:29:00,265
albeit a very big front room.
What is it?

436
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:03,620
Yeah. Just looks like a "thing".
People don't question things.

437
00:29:03,655 --> 00:29:06,185
They think, "Just a thing."
Leave it alone.

438
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:09,580
I make these connections,
and this looks like a teleport pod.

439
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:19,820
Oh! 'Orbit now holding at 556.3,
sector 270.'

440
00:29:19,855 --> 00:29:21,505
We have an intruder!

441
00:29:21,540 --> 00:29:24,100
How did he get in?
"In-tru-der window"?!

442
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:27,105
Bye-bye!

443
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:29,420
Ross, get out!
Luke, come with me.

444
00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:34,620
Sontaran!

445
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:36,705
That's your name, isn't it?

446
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:39,065
You're a Sontaran.
How did I know that, eh?

447
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:42,345
Fascinating, isn't it?
Isn't that worth keeping me alive?

448
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:46,200
I order you to surrender, in the
name of UNIT. That's not gonna work.

449
00:29:46,235 --> 00:29:50,020
Cordolaine signal, am I right?
Copper excitation -
stops the bullets.

450
00:29:50,055 --> 00:29:52,077
How do you know so much? Well...

451
00:29:52,112 --> 00:29:54,065
Who is he? He didn't give his name.

452
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:58,820
This isn't typical
Sontaran behaviour, is it?

453
00:29:58,855 --> 00:30:02,737
Hiding, using teenagers,
stopping bullets...

454
00:30:02,772 --> 00:30:06,620
You dishonour me, sir!
Yeah? Then show yourself!

455
00:30:06,655 --> 00:30:08,940
I will look into my enemy's eyes!

456
00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:20,945
Oh, my God! And your name?

457
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:26,220
General Staal of the 10th Sontaran
Fleet. Staal the Undefeated!

458
00:30:26,255 --> 00:30:28,465
What if you DO get defeated?

459
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:31,105
Not Quite So Undefeated Any More,
But Never Mind?

460
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:34,940
He's like a potato. A baked potato,
a talking baked potato.

461
00:30:34,975 --> 00:30:38,740
Now, Ross, don't be rude.
You look like a pink weasel to him.

462
00:30:38,775 --> 00:30:42,500
The Sontarans are
the finest soldiers in the galaxy,

463
00:30:42,535 --> 00:30:44,145
dedicated to a life of warfare.

464
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:47,540
A clone race, grown in batches of
millions - only one weakness.

465
00:30:47,575 --> 00:30:49,065
Sontarans have no weakness!

466
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:51,540
A good weakness.
Aren't you meant to be clever?

467
00:30:51,575 --> 00:30:53,185
Only an idiot would provoke him.

468
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:55,980
They're fed by a probic vent
in the back of their neck -

469
00:30:56,015 --> 00:30:57,305
that's their weak spot -

470
00:30:57,340 --> 00:30:59,860
so they have to face
their enemies in battle.

471
00:30:59,895 --> 00:31:02,380
Brilliant -
they can never turn their back.

472
00:31:02,415 --> 00:31:05,340
We stare into the face of death!

473
00:31:05,375 --> 00:31:07,700
Yeah? Well, stare at this.

474
00:31:11,660 --> 00:31:13,340
What have you done?!

475
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:27,380
Don't touch me!

476
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:32,700
A Sontaran would rather be
court martialled than show pain.

477
00:31:32,735 --> 00:31:35,100
I must return.
But he broke the teleport.

478
00:31:35,135 --> 00:31:38,860
Pah! Primitive sonic trickery!

479
00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:43,180
The device is now repaired.

480
00:31:48,060 --> 00:31:50,225
Our presence is known.

481
00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:52,825
Soldiers, we move to a war footing!

482
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:56,460
I see you face battle open skinned,
sir. Might I share that honour?

483
00:31:56,495 --> 00:31:58,177
You may.

484
00:31:58,212 --> 00:31:59,860
Thank you.

485
00:32:04,420 --> 00:32:10,460
How...do you tell each other apart?
We say the same of humans.

486
00:32:10,495 --> 00:32:14,260
Tell me, boy. How many ATMOS
devices have been installed?

487
00:32:14,295 --> 00:32:16,945
They've gone worldwide,
but only about half.

488
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:21,860
Which means 400 million cars
converted - a fine arsenal!

489
00:32:21,895 --> 00:32:23,585
Sufficient for conversion?

490
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:27,260
More than enough, yeah, and that
test signal proved that it works.

491
00:32:27,295 --> 00:32:30,060
52 deaths in the same second.
Man, that is so cool!

492
00:32:30,095 --> 00:32:32,180
Is the temperature significant?

493
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:38,180
No, that's just a phrase.

494
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:42,820
I'll get my people ready, General.
Just tell me where and when.

495
00:32:42,855 --> 00:32:46,257
Have we infiltrated UNIT?
The process is about to begin.

496
00:32:46,292 --> 00:32:49,660
Then you'll see it completed,
Commander Skorr! Get to it!

497
00:32:49,695 --> 00:32:51,140
Yes, sir!

498
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:03,660
Is someone gonna tell me
what the hell is going on?

499
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:07,420
OK...

500
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:14,180
So, listen,
you're not the first aliens I've met.
Just tell me who you are.

501
00:33:14,215 --> 00:33:18,145
Commander Skorr
of the 10th Sontaran Battle Fleet,

502
00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:22,180
known as Skorr the Bloodbringer.
What have you done to those two?

503
00:33:22,215 --> 00:33:25,940
Simple hypnotic control,
as with the factory drones,

504
00:33:25,975 --> 00:33:29,060
but with you,
we need something more complex.

505
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:40,385
What...is that?!

506
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:43,100
Soon, THAT will be you.

507
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:53,260
ATMOS devices
operating at 100% efficiency.

508
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:01,060
Continue.

509
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:17,740
War can never come too soon.

510
00:34:17,775 --> 00:34:20,540
Take your last look, boy.

511
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:25,420
It was never big enough for me.

512
00:34:25,455 --> 00:34:27,460
I like your ambition.

513
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:32,280
That Doctor, he was in a UNIT jeep.

514
00:34:32,315 --> 00:34:34,347
It should have ATMOS installed.

515
00:34:34,382 --> 00:34:36,380
You said you didn't know his name.

516
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:41,720
I don't. He just said Doctor.
Does that mean something?

517
00:34:41,755 --> 00:34:45,460
There is an enemy of the Sontarans
known as the Doctor,

518
00:34:45,495 --> 00:34:47,105
a face changer.

519
00:34:47,140 --> 00:34:48,905
Do you mean he's an alien, too?

520
00:34:48,940 --> 00:34:52,305
Legend says he led the battle
in the last great Time War.

521
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:57,420
The finest war in history, and we
weren't allowed to be part of it!

522
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:05,420
The last of the Time Lords will die
at the hands of the Sontaran Empire

523
00:35:05,455 --> 00:35:08,460
in the ruins of his precious earth.

524
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:29,360
It is inadvisable to struggle.

525
00:35:29,395 --> 00:35:31,425
The female has a weak thorax.

526
00:35:31,460 --> 00:35:34,460
But what are you doing?
Completing mental transfer.

527
00:35:34,495 --> 00:35:37,540
The clone needs full memory access.
Clone?

528
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:49,340
You can't...

529
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:57,200
That's not... You will sleep, girl.

530
00:35:57,235 --> 00:36:00,507
Sleep, and keep the memories alive.

531
00:36:00,542 --> 00:36:03,121
Memories we can use - in battle.

532
00:36:03,156 --> 00:36:05,665
We have the Doctor's vehicle.

533
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:10,580
An ordinary death for such
a remarkable enemy, but proceed.

534
00:36:10,615 --> 00:36:15,460
Greyhound 40 to Trap One.
Repeat, can you hear me? Over!

535
00:36:15,495 --> 00:36:17,865
Why's it not working?
Must be the Sontarans.

536
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:21,500
If they can trace that, they
can isolate the ATMOS. 'Turn left.'

537
00:36:21,535 --> 00:36:25,060
Try going right. It said left.
I know, so go right.

538
00:36:25,095 --> 00:36:27,860
I've got no control.
It's driving itself!

539
00:36:27,895 --> 00:36:30,825
It won't stop! The doors are locked!

540
00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:33,705
Ah, it's deadlocked!
I can't stop it. Let me.

541
00:36:33,740 --> 00:36:37,200
The sat-nav's just a box
wired through the whole car!

542
00:36:37,235 --> 00:36:40,660
Is he going in the water?
I love it, with the water!

543
00:36:41,540 --> 00:36:43,420
We're heading for the river!

544
00:36:44,580 --> 00:36:48,180
ATMOS, are you programmed to
contradict my orders? 'Confirmed.'

545
00:36:48,215 --> 00:36:51,025
Anything I say, you ignore it?
'Confirmed.'

546
00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:55,620
Drive into the river!
I order you to drive into the river!
Do it! Drive into the river!

547
00:37:05,580 --> 00:37:08,425
'Turn right, left...' Get down!

548
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:11,940
'Left, right, left, right, left...'

549
00:37:16,580 --> 00:37:19,900
Oh, is that it?

550
00:37:19,935 --> 00:37:23,185
ATMOS terminated.

551
00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:25,300
Then prepare the weapons.

552
00:37:25,335 --> 00:37:27,380
Is the operative in place?

553
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:40,220
Ready and waiting to advance
the great Sontaran cause, sir.

554
00:37:40,255 --> 00:37:41,660
Then go to work.

555
00:37:49,620 --> 00:37:51,980
You would not believe
the day I'm having.

556
00:38:04,005 --> 00:38:05,145
I'll requisition us a vehicle.

557
00:38:05,180 --> 00:38:08,380
Anything without ATMOS,
and don't point your gun at people!

558
00:38:08,415 --> 00:38:12,140
Is it him? Is it him?
Is it the Doctor?

559
00:38:12,175 --> 00:38:16,140
Ah! It's you! Who?

560
00:38:16,860 --> 00:38:20,185
Oh! It's you!

561
00:38:20,220 --> 00:38:22,145
What? Have you met before?

562
00:38:22,180 --> 00:38:25,580
Yeah, Christmas Eve.
He disappeared right in front of me!

563
00:38:25,615 --> 00:38:28,380
And you never said?
Well, you never said!

564
00:38:28,415 --> 00:38:30,385
Wilf, sir. Wilfred Mott.

565
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:32,585
You must be one of them aliens!

566
00:38:32,620 --> 00:38:35,940
Yeah, but don't shout it out.
Nice to meet you properly, Wilf.

567
00:38:35,975 --> 00:38:38,865
An alien hand! Donna, anything?
She's not answering.

568
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:42,185
What is it, "Sonteruns"?
Sont-ar-ans.
There must be more to it.

569
00:38:42,220 --> 00:38:47,420
They can't be just remote
controlling cars. That's not enough.
Is anyone answering? Hold on.

570
00:38:47,455 --> 00:38:50,940
Don't tell me...Donna Noble!
Martha! Hold on, he's here.

571
00:38:50,975 --> 00:38:53,277
Martha, tell Colonel Mace
it's the Sontarans.

572
00:38:53,312 --> 00:38:55,545
They're in the file -
Code Red Sontarans -

573
00:38:55,580 --> 00:38:59,820
but if they're inside,
tell him not to start shooting.
UNIT will get massacred.

574
00:38:59,855 --> 00:39:03,740
I'll get back as soon as I can.
Got that? Code Red Sontaran. Gotcha.

575
00:39:03,775 --> 00:39:08,820
Dr Jones, found anything yet?
No, sir. Nothing to report.

576
00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:14,545
You didn't find anything before.

577
00:39:14,580 --> 00:39:17,820
Yeah, but now I know it's Sontaran,
I know what I'm looking for.

578
00:39:17,855 --> 00:39:19,825
Doctor, Donna
is my only grandchild.

579
00:39:19,860 --> 00:39:22,220
Promise me you're gonna
take care of her.

580
00:39:22,255 --> 00:39:24,545
She takes care of me!
That's my Donna!

581
00:39:24,580 --> 00:39:27,480
She was always bossing us round,
even when she was tiny.

582
00:39:27,515 --> 00:39:30,467
The little General,
we used to call her. Don't start!

583
00:39:30,502 --> 00:39:33,420
And some of the boys!
A different one every week.

584
00:39:33,455 --> 00:39:35,545
Who was that one
with the nail varnish?

585
00:39:35,580 --> 00:39:40,025
Matthew Richards. He lives
in Kilburn now...with a man.

586
00:39:40,060 --> 00:39:44,940
Whoa! It's a temporal pocket. I knew
there was something else in there!

587
00:39:44,975 --> 00:39:48,297
It's hidden just a second
out of sync with real time.

588
00:39:48,332 --> 00:39:51,620
But what's it hiding?
I don't know - men and their cars!

589
00:39:51,655 --> 00:39:54,377
Sometimes I think, if I was a car...

590
00:39:54,412 --> 00:39:57,100
Oh, it's you! Doctor...what was it?

591
00:39:57,135 --> 00:39:58,905
That's me!

592
00:39:58,940 --> 00:40:02,140
Have you met him as well?
Dad, it's the man from the wedding,

593
00:40:02,175 --> 00:40:04,425
when you were laid up
with Spanish flu!

594
00:40:04,460 --> 00:40:08,220
I'm warning you, last time that man
turned up, it was a disaster.

595
00:40:08,255 --> 00:40:10,740
Get back!

596
00:40:12,460 --> 00:40:13,460
Show me where!

597
00:40:15,740 --> 00:40:17,905
London. That's Chiswick.

598
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:19,940
Who could have such knowledge?

599
00:40:19,975 --> 00:40:21,905
Only the Doctor. He survived!

600
00:40:21,940 --> 00:40:26,360
Excellent! Then battle will
be joined. Glorious warfare!

601
00:40:26,395 --> 00:40:30,847
10th Sontaran Battle Fleet,
we move to the final phase!

602
00:40:30,882 --> 00:40:35,300
Prepare the subjugation of
earth for the glory of Sontar!

603
00:40:35,335 --> 00:40:37,397
Announcing Battle Status One.

604
00:40:37,432 --> 00:40:39,425
All soldiers to positions.

605
00:40:39,460 --> 00:40:42,900
Repeat, we are now
at Battle Status One.

606
00:40:42,935 --> 00:40:44,380
Rejoice!

607
00:40:56,260 --> 00:40:59,900
That'll stop it. I told you!

608
00:40:59,935 --> 00:41:02,145
He's blown up the car!

609
00:41:02,180 --> 00:41:06,340
Who is he anyway? What sort of doctor
blows up cars?! Oh, not now, Mum!

610
00:41:06,375 --> 00:41:08,557
Should I make an appointment?

611
00:41:08,592 --> 00:41:11,146
That wasn't just exhaust fumes.

612
00:41:11,181 --> 00:41:13,460
Some sort of gas, artificial gas.

613
00:41:13,495 --> 00:41:15,740
And it's aliens, is it? Aliens?

614
00:41:15,775 --> 00:41:17,900
If it's poisonous...

615
00:41:24,540 --> 00:41:25,945
Trigger the converters!

616
00:41:25,980 --> 00:41:31,300
And deadlock every single one!

617
00:41:32,420 --> 00:41:36,620
No, don't! Turn it off!

618
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:42,100
Grandad, get out of there!
I can't! It's not locked!
It's them aliens again!

619
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:47,140
What's he doing? What's he done?
They've isolated it!

620
00:42:01,420 --> 00:42:04,060
Turn them off! Turn them off!

621
00:42:05,140 --> 00:42:06,665
Turn off the engines!

622
00:42:06,700 --> 00:42:09,900
It's all of them, sir.
Every single car on the planet!

623
00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:16,380
Now we begin. Let's get to work.

624
00:42:20,340 --> 00:42:25,900
There's gas inside the car!
He's gonna choke! Doctor!

625
00:42:27,260 --> 00:42:29,320
It won't open!

626
00:42:31,380 --> 00:42:32,900
It's the whole world...

627
00:42:40,820 --> 00:42:43,740
400 million weapons!

628
00:42:43,775 --> 00:42:46,625
Sontar, ha! Sontar, ha!

629
00:42:47,578 --> 00:42:50,425
Sontar, ha! Sontar, ha!

630
00:42:50,460 --> 00:42:54,380
Sontar, ha! Sontar, ha!
Sontar, ha! Sontar, ha!

631
00:42:54,415 --> 00:42:58,300
Sontar, ha! Sontar,ha!
Sontar, ha! Sontar, ha!

632
00:43:10,780 --> 00:43:14,225
Sontar, ha! Sontar, ha!
Sontar, ha! Sontar, ha!

633
00:43:14,260 --> 00:43:20,060
Sontar, ha! Sontar, ha!
Sontar, ha! Sontar, ha!
Sontar, ha! Sontar, ha!

634
00:43:20,095 --> 00:43:23,140
Sontar, ha! Sontar, ha!
Sontar, ha! Sontar, ha!

635
00:43:23,175 --> 00:43:25,700
Doctor! Sontar, ha! Sontar, ha!

636
00:43:55,620 --> 00:43:59,460
The Government has declared a state
of emergency. Launching in ten...

637
00:43:59,495 --> 00:44:01,345
Oh, man! This is war! Nine...

638
00:44:01,380 --> 00:44:04,260
Do not engage the Sontarans
in battle. Eight...

639
00:44:04,295 --> 00:44:06,185
The planet is going nuclear!

640
00:44:06,220 --> 00:44:09,100
Seven. It's time I revealed
what our work has been for.

641
00:44:09,135 --> 00:44:13,100
Six. The bravery of idiots
is bravery nonetheless.

642
00:44:13,135 --> 00:44:14,545
Five. God save us.

643
00:44:14,580 --> 00:44:17,620
Four. They need this gas
for something else.

644
00:44:17,655 --> 00:44:19,740
Three. All troops, Code Red.

645
00:44:19,775 --> 00:44:21,745
Two. At arms.

646
00:44:21,780 --> 00:44:23,900
One. Get them out of there!

647
00:44:23,901 --> 00:44:25,384
Zero.

648
