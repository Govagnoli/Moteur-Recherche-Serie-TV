1
00:00:14,243 --> 00:00:17,590
- I said, no.
- A sapphire waterfall!

2
00:00:17,690 --> 00:00:19,574
It's a waterfall, made of sapphires!

3
00:00:19,849 --> 00:00:21,480
<i>This enormous jewel,
size of a glacier,</i>

4
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:24,660
reaches the Cliffs of Oblivion, then
shatters into sapphires at the edge,

5
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:27,581
they fall 100,000 feet
into a crystal ravine.

6
00:00:27,681 --> 00:00:31,755
- I bet you say that to all the girls.
- Oh, come on, they're boarding now.

7
00:00:31,855 --> 00:00:34,250
It's no fun on my own.
Four hours, that's all it takes.

8
00:00:34,657 --> 00:00:38,889
<i>No, that's four hours there and four
hours back, that's like a school trip.</i>

9
00:00:38,989 --> 00:00:41,116
- I'd rather go sunbathing!
- You be careful.

10
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:43,016
<i>That's X-tonic sunlight.</i>

11
00:00:43,116 --> 00:00:47,475
Oh, I'm safe. It says in the brochure,
this glass is 15-feet thick.

12
00:00:47,575 --> 00:00:48,680
<i>All right, I give up.</i>

13
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:51,504
Back for dinner, we'll try that
antigravity restaurant. With bibs.

14
00:00:51,604 --> 00:00:52,355
<i>That's a date.</i>

15
00:00:52,641 --> 00:00:53,767
Well, not a date.

16
00:00:53,867 --> 00:00:55,739
Oh, you know what I mean.
Oh, get off!

17
00:00:55,977 --> 00:00:57,120
- See you later.
- Oy!

18
00:00:57,220 --> 00:00:59,589
- And you be careful, all right?
- Naaah.

19
00:00:59,689 --> 00:01:00,690
Taking a big space truck

20
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:03,346
with bunch of strangers across
diamond planet called Midnight?

21
00:01:03,446 --> 00:01:04,985
What could possibly go wrong?

22
00:01:29,251 --> 00:01:32,510

00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:45,324
<i>Complimentary juicepack
and complimentary...</i>

27
00:01:45,424 --> 00:01:47,235
<i>Just the headphones, please.</i>

28
00:01:47,695 --> 00:01:48,934
There you go.

29
00:01:50,063 --> 00:01:52,560
That's the headphones
for Channels 1 to 36,

30
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:55,412
modem link for 3D vidgames,
complimentary earplugs,

31
00:01:55,644 --> 00:01:57,920
<i>complimentary slippers,
complimentary juicepack,</i>

32
00:01:58,020 --> 00:01:59,471
<i>and complimentary peanuts.</i>

33
00:01:59,571 --> 00:02:01,545
I must warn you some
products may contain nuts.

34
00:02:01,814 --> 00:02:03,290
That'll be the peanuts.

35
00:02:03,935 --> 00:02:07,019
- Enjoy your trip.
- Oh, I can't wait! Allons-y!

36
00:02:07,708 --> 00:02:10,550
- I'm sorry?
- It's French, for let's go!

37
00:02:10,815 --> 00:02:12,070
Fascinating.

38
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:15,948
- Headphones for channels 1-36...
- No thank you! Not for us!

39
00:02:16,048 --> 00:02:18,133
- Earplugs, please.
- There you go.

40
00:02:18,233 --> 00:02:21,755
They call it a sapphire waterfall,
but it's no such thing,

41
00:02:21,855 --> 00:02:24,040
sapphire's an aluminium oxide,

42
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:27,664
but the glacier is just a compound
silica with iron pigmentation!

43
00:02:27,764 --> 00:02:30,361
<i>- Have you got that pillow for my neck?
- Yes, sir.</i>

44
00:02:30,461 --> 00:02:31,555
<i>And the pills?</i>

45
00:02:31,655 --> 00:02:34,889
Yes, all measured
out for you, there you go.

46
00:02:35,527 --> 00:02:36,220
Hobbes!

47
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:38,190
Professor Winfold Hobbes!

48
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:40,718
- I'm the Doctor, hello!
- It's my 14th time!

49
00:02:40,937 --> 00:02:42,165
Oh! My first.

50
00:02:42,265 --> 00:02:44,117
And I'm Dee Dee, Dee Dee Blasco.

51
00:02:44,217 --> 00:02:47,332
Don't bother the man!
Where's my water bottle?

52
00:02:47,432 --> 00:02:50,142
<i>Complimentary slippers,
complimentary juicepack,</i>

53
00:02:50,242 --> 00:02:51,731
<i>and complimentary peanuts,</i>

54
00:02:51,831 --> 00:02:54,750
<i>I must warn you some
products may contain nuts.</i>

55
00:02:55,010 --> 00:02:59,395
Don't be silly, come and sit with us.
Look! We get slippers!

56
00:02:59,495 --> 00:03:01,779
- Jethro! Do what your mother says.
- I'm sitting here.

57
00:03:01,879 --> 00:03:04,683
Oh, he's ashamed of us.
But he doesn't mind us paying, does he?

58
00:03:04,783 --> 00:03:07,993
Don't you two start. Should I save
the juicepack or have it now?

59
00:03:08,093 --> 00:03:09,870
Look, it's peach and clementine!

60
00:03:10,545 --> 00:03:12,862
Ladies and gentlemen
and variations thereupon,

61
00:03:12,962 --> 00:03:16,709
welcome on board the Crusader 50,
if you would fasten your seatbelts,

62
00:03:16,809 --> 00:03:18,670
we'll be leaving any moment.

63
00:03:19,335 --> 00:03:19,990
Doors!

64
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:23,910
Shields down!

65
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:32,138
I'm afraid the view is shielded
until we reach the Waterfall Palace.

66
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:35,161
Also, a reminder, Midnight has no air,

67
00:03:35,261 --> 00:03:38,440
so please don't touch
the exterior door seals.

68
00:03:38,909 --> 00:03:41,119
Fire exit at the rear,
and should we need to use it...

69
00:03:41,388 --> 00:03:42,550
you first.

70
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:46,531
Now I will hand you
over to Driver Joe...

71
00:03:47,107 --> 00:03:48,145
<i>Driver Joe at the wheel!</i>

72
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:50,765
<i>There's been a diamondfall
at the Winter Witch Canyon,</i>

73
00:03:50,865 --> 00:03:54,025
<i>so we'll be taking a slight detour,
as you'll see on the map.</i>

74
00:03:54,438 --> 00:03:57,391
<i>The journey covers 500
kliks to the Multifaceted Coast,</i>

75
00:03:57,710 --> 00:04:00,400
<i>duration is estimated at four hours.</i>

76
00:04:00,726 --> 00:04:02,215
<i>Thank you for travelling with us,</i>

77
00:04:02,315 --> 00:04:05,420
<i>and as they used to say
in the olden days, wagons roll!</i>

78
00:04:13,239 --> 00:04:14,341
<i>For your entertainment,</i>

79
00:04:14,441 --> 00:04:18,395
we have the Music Channel
playing retrovids of Earth Classics.

80
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:21,874
# "Do It Do It Again" #
by Raffaella Carra

81
00:04:21,974 --> 00:04:25,710
Also, the latest artistic
installation from Ludovic Klein.

82
00:04:28,082 --> 00:04:30,887
<i>Plus, for the youngsters,
a rare treat : </i>

83
00:04:30,987 --> 00:04:32,470
the Animation Archives.

84
00:04:33,176 --> 00:04:36,530
Four hours of funtime!
Enjoy!

85
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:06,687
Well, that's a mercy!

86
00:05:06,787 --> 00:05:11,274
I do apologise, ladies and gentlemen
and variations thereupon.

87
00:05:11,374 --> 00:05:13,822
We seem to have had a failure
of the Entertainment System...

88
00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:14,735
Aw...

89
00:05:14,835 --> 00:05:17,513
- But what do we do?!
- We've got four hours of this!

90
00:05:17,613 --> 00:05:19,634
Four hours of just sitting here!

91
00:05:19,734 --> 00:05:23,270
Tell you what! We'll have to talk
to each other instead!

92
00:05:28,292 --> 00:05:30,883
98 KLIKS LATER...

93
00:05:33,659 --> 00:05:35,129
<i>So Biff said, "I'm going swimming".</i>

94
00:05:35,229 --> 00:05:38,501
Oh, I was all ready,
trunks and everything! Nose plug!

95
00:05:38,601 --> 00:05:40,929
He had this little nose plug,
you should've seen him.

96
00:05:41,029 --> 00:05:43,112
I went marching up to the lifeguard,

97
00:05:43,212 --> 00:05:46,256
and he was a Shamboni,
you know, those big foreheads?

98
00:05:46,413 --> 00:05:47,727
<i>Great big forehead!</i>

99
00:05:47,827 --> 00:05:49,779
And I said, where's the pool?

100
00:05:49,879 --> 00:05:52,632
And he said, "The pool is abstract!"

101
00:05:54,763 --> 00:05:56,128
It wasn't a real pool!

102
00:05:56,228 --> 00:05:58,625
- It was a concept!
- And you wore a nose plug!

103
00:05:58,725 --> 00:06:01,146
I was like this!
Mmm... where's the pool?

104
00:06:04,591 --> 00:06:07,594
150 KLIKS LATER...

105
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:09,721
<i>I'm just a second-year student,</i>

106
00:06:09,821 --> 00:06:12,240
but I wrote a paper on
the Lost Moon of Poosh,

107
00:06:12,506 --> 00:06:15,600
Professor Hobbes read it, liked it,
took me on as a researcher.

108
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:17,406
Just for the holidays. Well...

109
00:06:17,506 --> 00:06:21,317
I say researcher, most of the time
he's got me fetching and carrying.

110
00:06:21,417 --> 00:06:24,066
- But it's all good experience!
- And did they ever find it?

111
00:06:24,166 --> 00:06:26,355
- Find what?
- The Lost Moon of Poosh!

112
00:06:26,887 --> 00:06:28,213
No! Not yet!

113
00:06:28,313 --> 00:06:32,395
Well, maybe that'll be your great
discovery, one day. Here's to Poosh!

114
00:06:32,715 --> 00:06:33,777
Poosh!

115
00:06:34,233 --> 00:06:35,891
209 KLIKS LATER...

116
00:06:35,991 --> 00:06:38,560
No, no, I'm with this
friend of mine,

117
00:06:38,725 --> 00:06:41,435
Donna, she stayed behind
in the Leisure Palace. You?

118
00:06:41,535 --> 00:06:43,000
No, it's just me.

119
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:45,075
Oh, I've done plenty of that.

120
00:06:45,348 --> 00:06:46,960
Travelling on my own.

121
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:48,309
I love it.

122
00:06:48,409 --> 00:06:51,243
- Do what you want! Go anywhere!
- I'm still getting used to it.

123
00:06:51,987 --> 00:06:55,235
I've... found myself single,
rather recently. Not by choice.

124
00:06:55,427 --> 00:06:57,550
- What happened?
- Oh, the usual.

125
00:06:57,885 --> 00:07:00,350
She needed her own
space, as they say.

126
00:07:01,038 --> 00:07:02,845
A different galaxy, in fact.

127
00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:05,147
I reckon that's enough space, don't you?

128
00:07:05,489 --> 00:07:06,149
Yeah.

129
00:07:07,501 --> 00:07:09,528
I had a friend who went
to a different universe.

130
00:07:11,089 --> 00:07:13,789
Oh, what's this, chicken or beef?

131
00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:15,780
I think it's both.

132
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,359
251 KLIKS LATER...

133
00:07:20,459 --> 00:07:22,686
<i>So this is Midnight, d'you see?</i>

134
00:07:22,786 --> 00:07:28,315
Bombarded by the sun!
X-tonic rays, raw Galvanic Radiation...

135
00:07:28,994 --> 00:07:30,395
<i>Dee Dee, next slide!</i>

136
00:07:31,437 --> 00:07:33,000
<i>It's my pet project.</i>

137
00:07:33,465 --> 00:07:36,937
Actually, I'm the first person
to research this.

138
00:07:37,037 --> 00:07:38,500
Because you see...

139
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:43,117
..the history is fascinating,

140
00:07:44,038 --> 00:07:46,200
because there is no history.

141
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:49,720
There's no life in this entire system,
there couldn't be.

142
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:52,449
Before the Leisure Palace
Company moved in,

143
00:07:52,549 --> 00:07:56,275
no-one had come here in all eternity.

144
00:07:56,668 --> 00:07:58,703
No living thing...

145
00:08:01,775 --> 00:08:03,080
But how d'you know?

146
00:08:03,486 --> 00:08:05,197
I mean, if no-one can go outside...

147
00:08:05,297 --> 00:08:06,924
Oh, his imagination! Here we go!

148
00:08:07,024 --> 00:08:08,911
- He's got a point, though.
- Exactly!

149
00:08:09,011 --> 00:08:13,529
We look upon this world through glass.
Safe inside our metal box.

150
00:08:13,629 --> 00:08:16,830
Even the Leisure Palace
was lowered down from orbit.

151
00:08:17,245 --> 00:08:20,075
And here we are now,
crossing Midnight...

152
00:08:20,648 --> 00:08:22,556
but never touching it.

153
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:28,110
We've stopped.

154
00:08:30,729 --> 00:08:31,980
<i>Have we stopped?</i>

155
00:08:33,213 --> 00:08:34,001
<i>Are we there?</i>

156
00:08:34,101 --> 00:08:35,440
We can't be, it's too soon.

157
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:38,627
<i>They don't stop,
Crusader vehicles never stop.</i>

158
00:08:38,983 --> 00:08:42,830
If you could just return to your seats,
it's just a small delay.

159
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:49,510
- Maybe just a pit stop.
- What's going on?

160
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:52,898
There's no pit to stop in, I've been
on this expedition 14 times,

161
00:08:52,998 --> 00:08:53,824
they never stop.

162
00:08:53,924 --> 00:08:56,967
Evidently, we have stopped,
so there's no point in denying it.

163
00:08:57,933 --> 00:09:00,191
- We've broken down!
- Thanks, Jethro.

164
00:09:00,291 --> 00:09:02,486
- In the middle of nowhere!
- That's enough, stop it!

165
00:09:02,586 --> 00:09:05,369
Ladies and gentlemen
and variations thereupon,

166
00:09:05,469 --> 00:09:08,050
we're just experiencing a short...

167
00:09:08,288 --> 00:09:11,642
delay, the driver needs
to stabilise the engine feeds.

168
00:09:11,951 --> 00:09:14,613
Perfectly routine, so if you could
just stay in your seats...

169
00:09:14,713 --> 00:09:16,659
- No, I'm sorry sir...
- There you go,

170
00:09:16,759 --> 00:09:20,075
- engine expert Two ticks!
- Sorry, sir, if you could sit down!

171
00:09:20,277 --> 00:09:22,298
- You're not supposed...
- If you could return...

172
00:09:22,398 --> 00:09:24,310
Company insurance,
let's get an assessment...

173
00:09:24,410 --> 00:09:26,421
So, what's the problem, Driver Joe?

174
00:09:26,521 --> 00:09:28,880
We're stabilising the engine feeds,
won't take long.

175
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:32,431
Um, no, cos that's the engine feed,
that light there, and it's fine,

176
00:09:32,531 --> 00:09:35,259
and it's a micropetrol engine,
so stabilising doesn't make sense?

177
00:09:35,359 --> 00:09:38,282
Soory, I'm a doctor. I'm very clever.
So what's wrong?

178
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:41,286
We just stopped, look, all systems fine
and everything's working,

179
00:09:41,386 --> 00:09:42,900
but we're not moving.

180
00:09:43,375 --> 00:09:46,017
You're right.
No faults. And who are you?

181
00:09:46,398 --> 00:09:48,990
Claude, I'm the mechanic. Trainee.

182
00:09:49,402 --> 00:09:50,734
Nice to meet you.

183
00:09:50,834 --> 00:09:54,127
I've sent a distress signal. They should
dispatch a rescue truck, top speed.

184
00:09:54,227 --> 00:09:56,395
- How long till they get here?
- About an hour.

185
00:09:56,692 --> 00:09:58,731
Well, since we're waiting...

186
00:09:59,570 --> 00:10:01,223
shall we take a look outside?

187
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,600
Lift the screens a bit?

188
00:10:04,908 --> 00:10:07,840
It's 100% X-tonic out there,
we'd be vaporised.

189
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:11,878
No, those windows are Finitoglass,
give you a couple of minutes. Go on!

190
00:10:12,591 --> 00:10:13,910
Live a little!

191
00:10:28,584 --> 00:10:30,075
<i>That is beautiful...</i>

192
00:10:30,808 --> 00:10:32,360
<i>Look at all those diamonds!</i>

193
00:10:32,647 --> 00:10:35,094
<i>Poisoned by the sun.
No-one can ever touch them.</i>

194
00:10:35,194 --> 00:10:36,962
Joe, you said we took a detour?

195
00:10:37,062 --> 00:10:39,992
- Just 40 kliks to the west.
- Is that a recognised path?

196
00:10:40,092 --> 00:10:43,022
No, it's a new one, the computer
worked it out, on automatic.

197
00:10:43,316 --> 00:10:44,786
So we're the first?

198
00:10:45,412 --> 00:10:46,757
<i>This piece of ground.</i>

199
00:10:47,364 --> 00:10:49,175
<i>No-one's ever been here before.</i>

200
00:10:50,845 --> 00:10:53,198
<i>Not in the whole of recorded history.</i>

201
00:10:53,298 --> 00:10:54,355
Did you just...?

202
00:10:56,119 --> 00:10:58,995
- No, sorry. Nothing.
- What did you see?

203
00:10:59,095 --> 00:11:00,560
Just there. That ridge.

204
00:11:01,085 --> 00:11:03,799
<i>Like... a shadow. Just for a second.</i>

205
00:11:04,056 --> 00:11:05,350
What sort of shadow?

206
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:07,632
X-tonic rising!

207
00:11:07,871 --> 00:11:09,041
Shields down.

208
00:11:11,024 --> 00:11:13,520
Look, there he is, look, there!
- Where ?

209
00:11:15,130 --> 00:11:16,029
What was it?

210
00:11:16,129 --> 00:11:19,428
Like, just, something...
shifting, something sort of... dark.

211
00:11:19,848 --> 00:11:21,343
Like it was... running.

212
00:11:21,806 --> 00:11:23,235
Running which way?

213
00:11:23,583 --> 00:11:25,110
Towards us.

214
00:11:25,210 --> 00:11:29,355
Doctor, back to your seat
and not a word, rescue's on its way.

215
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:31,825
<i>If you could close the door,
thank you.</i>

216
00:11:35,883 --> 00:11:38,586
What did they say? Did they tell you?
What is it, what's wrong?

217
00:11:38,686 --> 00:11:40,720
Oh, just stabilising,
happens all the time.

218
00:11:40,957 --> 00:11:42,177
I don't need this.

219
00:11:42,384 --> 00:11:44,705
I'm on a schedule.
This is completely unnecessary!

220
00:11:44,805 --> 00:11:46,516
Back to your seats, thank you.

221
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,646
Excuse me, Doctor,

222
00:11:52,719 --> 00:11:54,560
but they're micropetrol
engines, aren't they?

223
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:57,027
- Now, don't bother the man.
- My father was a mechanic.

224
00:11:57,739 --> 00:12:00,671
Micropetrol doesn't stabilise,
what does 'stabilise' mean?

225
00:12:01,004 --> 00:12:03,510
Well. Bit of flim-flam.
Don't worry, they're sorting it out.

226
00:12:03,610 --> 00:12:06,243
- So it's not the engines?
- Just a little pause, that's all.

227
00:12:06,537 --> 00:12:07,729
<i>How much air have we got?</i>

228
00:12:07,829 --> 00:12:08,717
Professor, it's fine.

229
00:12:08,817 --> 00:12:10,025
- What did he say?
- Nothing!

230
00:12:10,125 --> 00:12:12,421
- Are we running out of air?
- I was just speculating...

231
00:12:12,521 --> 00:12:15,312
- Right miss? Are we running out of air?
- Is that the Captain said?

232
00:12:15,412 --> 00:12:16,588
If you could remain calm...

233
00:12:16,688 --> 00:12:18,465
- How much air have we got?
- Mum, stop it.

234
00:12:18,565 --> 00:12:20,825
- Everything's under control.
- Doesn't look like it!

235
00:12:20,925 --> 00:12:21,601
He said it.

236
00:12:21,701 --> 00:12:23,622
Fine, the air is on a circular filter...

237
00:12:23,722 --> 00:12:26,115
- He started it!
- Everyone...

238
00:12:27,935 --> 00:12:29,360
QUIET!

239
00:12:34,252 --> 00:12:35,147
Thank you.

240
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:38,982
Now, if you'd care to listen
to my good friend Dee Dee...

241
00:12:40,909 --> 00:12:41,585
Oh!

242
00:12:42,369 --> 00:12:43,214
Um...

243
00:12:43,558 --> 00:12:44,609
It's just that...

244
00:12:44,709 --> 00:12:48,795
Well, the air's on a circular filter so,
we could stay breathing for ten years.

245
00:12:49,545 --> 00:12:50,465
<i>There you go!</i>

246
00:12:51,032 --> 00:12:54,780
And I've spoken to the Captain,
I can guarantee you, everything's fine.

247
00:13:01,630 --> 00:13:02,769
What was that?

248
00:13:02,869 --> 00:13:05,378
It must be the metal.
We're cooling down,

249
00:13:05,678 --> 00:13:07,990
- it's just settling...
- Rocks. Could be rocks falling.

250
00:13:08,090 --> 00:13:10,477
What I want to know is,
how long do we have to sit here.

251
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:14,329
- What is that?
- Someone's out there!

252
00:13:14,429 --> 00:13:16,744
- Don't be ridiculous!
- Like I said, it could be rocks.

253
00:13:16,844 --> 00:13:19,630
We're in the open.
Nothing could fall against the sides.

254
00:13:21,555 --> 00:13:22,790
Knock knock.

255
00:13:23,332 --> 00:13:24,552
Who's there?

256
00:13:30,677 --> 00:13:32,241
<i>Is there something out there?</i>

257
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:35,194
Well? Anyone?

258
00:13:36,695 --> 00:13:38,184
What the hell is making that noise?

259
00:13:38,284 --> 00:13:41,137
I'm sorry, but the light
out there is X-tonic,

260
00:13:41,607 --> 00:13:45,788
<i>that means it would destroy
any living thing, in a split-second.</i>

261
00:13:45,888 --> 00:13:50,149
<i>It is impossible for
someone to be outside.</i>

262
00:13:54,672 --> 00:13:56,203
What the hell is that, then?!

263
00:13:56,773 --> 00:13:58,972
Sir! You really should
get back to your seat.

264
00:14:04,484 --> 00:14:05,460
Hello?

265
00:14:09,410 --> 00:14:10,340
It's moving...

266
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:17,400
It's trying the door.

267
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:21,717
There is no 'it',
there's nothing out there. Can't be.

268
00:14:37,014 --> 00:14:38,659
That's the entrance. Can it get in?

269
00:14:38,759 --> 00:14:40,993
No, that door's on 200
weight of hydraulics.

270
00:14:41,093 --> 00:14:44,515
- Stop it. Don't encourage them.
- What do you think it is?

271
00:14:44,809 --> 00:14:46,675
- Biff, don't...
- Mr Cane, better not...

272
00:14:47,829 --> 00:14:49,078
It's cast iron, that door...

273
00:14:53,344 --> 00:14:56,033
Three times! Did you hear that,
it did it three times?!

274
00:14:56,133 --> 00:14:57,775
- It answered!
- It did it three times!

275
00:14:57,875 --> 00:14:59,364
All right, everyone, calm down.

276
00:14:59,464 --> 00:15:04,145
No, but it answered, don't tell me
that thing's not alive, it answered him!

277
00:15:05,253 --> 00:15:08,480
I really must insist,
you get back to your seats...

278
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:10,902
No! Don't just stand there
telling us the rules!

279
00:15:11,002 --> 00:15:12,153
You're the hostess,

280
00:15:12,253 --> 00:15:14,275
you're supposed to do something!

281
00:15:25,441 --> 00:15:27,362
What the hell's making that noise?

282
00:15:27,556 --> 00:15:31,799
She said she'd get me. Stop it,
make it stop, somebody make it stop!

283
00:15:31,899 --> 00:15:35,013
Don't stand there looking at me, not
my fault, he started it with stories.

284
00:15:35,113 --> 00:15:36,839
- Calm down!
- He made it worse.

285
00:15:36,939 --> 00:15:39,699
- Why couldn't you leave it alone?
- Stop staring at me!

286
00:15:39,799 --> 00:15:42,080
- Just tell me what it is.
- Calm down!

287
00:15:45,349 --> 00:15:46,697
It's coming for me,

288
00:15:47,579 --> 00:15:50,538
it's coming for me,
it's coming for me...

289
00:15:51,464 --> 00:15:55,424
It's coming for me!
It's coming for me.

290
00:15:57,930 --> 00:15:59,070
Get out of there!

291
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:21,190
OK?

292
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:29,441
Arms. Legs. Neck.
Head. Nose. I'm fine...

293
00:16:30,717 --> 00:16:32,019
Everyone else?

294
00:16:34,225 --> 00:16:36,990
How are we?
Everyone all right?

295
00:16:37,422 --> 00:16:39,286
<i>Earthquake, must be...</i>

296
00:16:39,386 --> 00:16:42,427
But that's impossible,
the ground is fixed, it's solid.

297
00:16:42,527 --> 00:16:46,589
Got torches, everyone take a torch,
they're in the back of the seats.

298
00:16:50,406 --> 00:16:53,248
Oh, Jethro, sweetheart, come here...

299
00:16:53,348 --> 00:16:55,344
Never mind me, what about her?

300
00:16:58,090 --> 00:16:59,961
<i>- What happened to the seats?
- Who did that?</i>

301
00:17:00,061 --> 00:17:01,365
<i>They've been ripped up.</i>

302
00:17:03,821 --> 00:17:06,388
It's all right, it's all right,
it's all right, it's over.

303
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:08,027
We're still alive...

304
00:17:08,290 --> 00:17:10,067
<i>Look, the wall's still intact.
D'you see?</i>

305
00:17:10,167 --> 00:17:12,070
- Joe, Claude?
- We're safe.

306
00:17:12,170 --> 00:17:13,802
Driver Joe, can you hear me?

307
00:17:14,296 --> 00:17:17,239
I'm not getting any response,
the intercom must be down.

308
00:17:25,169 --> 00:17:26,439
What happened? What was that?

309
00:17:26,539 --> 00:17:28,590
Is it the driver?
Have we lost the driver?

310
00:17:29,323 --> 00:17:31,294
- The cabin's gone.
- Don't be ridiculous.

311
00:17:31,394 --> 00:17:34,216
- It can't be gone, how can it be gone?
- Well, you saw it!

312
00:17:34,316 --> 00:17:36,872
There was nothing there,
like it was ripped away.

313
00:17:36,972 --> 00:17:38,090
What are you doing?

314
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:40,130
That's bit of light, thank you.
Molto bene!

315
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:42,995
- You know what you're doing?
- Cabin's gone, leave that wall alone.

316
00:17:43,095 --> 00:17:44,272
The cabin can't be gone!

317
00:17:44,372 --> 00:17:47,720
No, it's safe, any rupture
would automatically seal itself...

318
00:17:49,935 --> 00:17:51,518
But something sliced it off.

319
00:17:53,428 --> 00:17:56,150
- You're right. The cabin's gone.
- But if it gets separated...

320
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:57,577
<i>It loses integrity.</i>

321
00:18:00,668 --> 00:18:02,745
I'm sorry. They've been reduced to dust.

322
00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:05,349
<i>The driver and the mechanic.</i>

323
00:18:06,882 --> 00:18:08,503
But they sent a distress signal.

324
00:18:08,603 --> 00:18:10,311
Help is on its way.
They saved our lives!

325
00:18:10,411 --> 00:18:12,350
We're gonna get out of here, I promise.

326
00:18:12,751 --> 00:18:14,870
<i>We're still alive,
and they're gonna find us.</i>

327
00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:16,262
Doctor. Look at her.

328
00:18:18,997 --> 00:18:21,474
Right, yes, sorry...
Have we got a medical kit?

329
00:18:21,774 --> 00:18:23,006
Why won't she turn around?

330
00:18:25,896 --> 00:18:30,030
- What's her name?
- Silvestry. Mrs Sky Silvestry.

331
00:18:31,652 --> 00:18:32,472
Sky?

332
00:18:33,629 --> 00:18:34,655
Can you hear me?

333
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:36,557
Are you all right?

334
00:18:39,310 --> 00:18:40,411
Can you move, Sky?

335
00:18:42,395 --> 00:18:43,358
Just look at me.

336
00:18:46,324 --> 00:18:47,926
That noise, from outside...

337
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:51,749
- it's stopped.
- Well, thank God for that.

338
00:18:51,849 --> 00:18:53,718
But what if it's
not outside any more?

339
00:18:55,370 --> 00:18:57,900
- What if it's inside?
- Inside? Where?

340
00:18:58,905 --> 00:19:00,200
It was heading for her.

341
00:19:01,530 --> 00:19:02,241
<i>Sky...</i>

342
00:19:03,461 --> 00:19:04,700
it's all right, Sky.

343
00:19:06,946 --> 00:19:08,460
I just want you to turn around,

344
00:19:08,967 --> 00:19:09,830
face me.

345
00:19:47,165 --> 00:19:47,947
Sky?

346
00:19:50,491 --> 00:19:51,317
Sky?

347
00:19:53,268 --> 00:19:55,539
- Are you all right?
- Are you all right?

348
00:19:55,721 --> 00:19:57,630
- Are you hurt?
- Are you hurt?

349
00:19:58,230 --> 00:20:00,676
- You don't have to talk.
- You don't have to talk.

350
00:20:01,051 --> 00:20:03,110
- I'm trying to help.
- I'm trying to help.

351
00:20:03,404 --> 00:20:05,899
- My name's the Doctor.
- My name's the Doctor.

352
00:20:06,231 --> 00:20:08,596
- OK, can you stop?
- OK, can you stop?

353
00:20:08,696 --> 00:20:10,756
- I'd like you to stop.
- I'd like you to stop.

354
00:20:10,856 --> 00:20:13,035
- Why's she doing that?
- Why's she doing that?

355
00:20:13,135 --> 00:20:14,621
- She's gone mad.
- She's gone mad.

356
00:20:14,721 --> 00:20:16,930
- Stop it. I said stop it!
- Stop it. I said stop it!

357
00:20:17,030 --> 00:20:19,070
- I Don't think she can.
- I Don't think she can.

358
00:20:19,170 --> 00:20:21,503
- Stop it, this isn't funny.
- Stop it, this isn't funny.

359
00:20:21,603 --> 00:20:23,592
- Sh, sh, all of you.
- Sh, sh, all of you.

360
00:20:23,692 --> 00:20:25,322
- My name's Jethro!
- My name's Jethro!

361
00:20:25,422 --> 00:20:28,195
- Jethro, leave it, shut up!
- Jethro, leave it, shut up!

362
00:20:34,474 --> 00:20:37,452
- Why are you repeating?
- Why are you repeating?

363
00:20:40,324 --> 00:20:42,750
- What is that, learning?
- What is that, learning?

364
00:20:43,356 --> 00:20:45,081
- Copying?
- Copying?

365
00:20:47,414 --> 00:20:49,479
- Absorbing?
- Absorbing?

366
00:20:52,438 --> 00:20:54,922
- The square root of pi is...
- The square root of pi is...

367
00:20:55,022 --> 00:21:00,315
- 1.77245385090551602729816748...
- 1.77245385090551602729816748...

368
00:21:00,415 --> 00:21:02,750
- 3341. Wow!
- 3341. Wow!

369
00:21:07,775 --> 00:21:09,766
- That's impossible.
- That's impossible.

370
00:21:09,866 --> 00:21:11,618
- She couldn't repeat all that.
- She...

371
00:21:11,718 --> 00:21:13,032
"Tell her to stop!"

372
00:21:13,132 --> 00:21:14,810
"She's driving me mad."

373
00:21:14,910 --> 00:21:16,187
"Make her STOP!"

374
00:21:16,287 --> 00:21:18,833
"Stop her staring at me, shut her up..."

375
00:21:20,698 --> 00:21:22,437
"Telling you, whatever your name is."

376
00:21:22,537 --> 00:21:23,974
"Stop it..."

377
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:27,227
"What's wrong with her eyes?"

378
00:21:33,650 --> 00:21:35,506
"Six, six, six."

379
00:21:45,607 --> 00:21:47,910
- That's the back-up system.
- Well!

380
00:21:48,604 --> 00:21:49,530
That's a bit better.

381
00:21:49,693 --> 00:21:53,184
- What about rescue, how long's?
- About 60 minutes, that's all.

382
00:21:54,016 --> 00:21:57,030
Then I suggest we all calm down.

383
00:21:57,445 --> 00:21:59,178
<i>This panic isn't helping.</i>

384
00:21:59,791 --> 00:22:04,311
<i>That poor woman is evidently
in a state of self-induced hysteria,</i>

385
00:22:04,411 --> 00:22:06,153
- we should leave her alone.
- Doctor...

386
00:22:07,030 --> 00:22:07,834
I know.

387
00:22:08,575 --> 00:22:10,447
Doctor, now step back,

388
00:22:11,122 --> 00:22:13,030
I think you should leave her...

389
00:22:14,054 --> 00:22:14,831
Alone.

390
00:22:18,426 --> 00:22:19,723
What's she doing?

391
00:22:21,264 --> 00:22:22,531
How can she do that?

392
00:22:22,631 --> 00:22:25,670
She's talking with you...
and with me!

393
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:27,211
Oh, my God!

394
00:22:28,022 --> 00:22:28,963
Biff, what's she doing?

395
00:22:29,063 --> 00:22:30,091
She's repeating...

396
00:22:31,307 --> 00:22:34,037
- At exactly the same time.
- That's impossible.

397
00:22:34,137 --> 00:22:37,430
-There's not even a delay.
- Ohh man, that is weird.

398
00:22:37,615 --> 00:22:41,275
I think you should all be very,
very quiet, have you got that?

399
00:22:41,375 --> 00:22:43,488
- How's she doing it?
- Mrs Cane, please, be quiet.

400
00:22:43,588 --> 00:22:46,743
But how can she do that?
She's got my voice, she's got my words!

401
00:22:46,843 --> 00:22:49,055
Sweetheart, be quiet, just...
hush now. Hush.

402
00:22:50,138 --> 00:22:52,219
- She's doing it to me!
- Just stop it, all of you.

403
00:22:52,319 --> 00:22:53,372
Stop it. Please.

404
00:23:00,710 --> 00:23:03,340
Now then, Sky. Are you Sky?

405
00:23:04,395 --> 00:23:05,928
Is Sky still in there?

406
00:23:06,028 --> 00:23:07,364
Mrs Silvestry?

407
00:23:10,504 --> 00:23:13,900
You know exactly what I'm going to say,
how are you doing that?

408
00:23:16,974 --> 00:23:18,154
Roast beef!

409
00:23:19,086 --> 00:23:20,062
Bananas!

410
00:23:21,013 --> 00:23:22,765
The Medusa Cascade.

411
00:23:25,899 --> 00:23:26,688
Bang!

412
00:23:27,057 --> 00:23:29,512
Rose Tyler, Martha Jones,
Donna Noble, TARDIS!

413
00:23:32,359 --> 00:23:35,099
Shamble bobble dibble dooble.

414
00:23:36,432 --> 00:23:38,836
Oh, Doctor, you're so handsome.
Yes, I am, thank you.

415
00:23:41,821 --> 00:23:44,980
A, B, C, D, E, F, G,
H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O...

416
00:23:51,054 --> 00:23:54,195
First she repeats. Then she catches up.
What's the next stage?

417
00:23:54,295 --> 00:23:55,671
Next stage of what?

418
00:23:55,771 --> 00:23:59,229
But that's not her, is it?
That's not Mrs Silvestry any more.

419
00:23:59,666 --> 00:24:01,434
I don't think so, no.

420
00:24:04,913 --> 00:24:05,902
I think...

421
00:24:06,878 --> 00:24:09,224
the more we talk,
the more she learns.

422
00:24:09,324 --> 00:24:11,758
Now, I'm all for education,
but in this case...

423
00:24:13,003 --> 00:24:16,491
maybe not. Let's just... move back.
Come on. Come with me.

424
00:24:16,591 --> 00:24:18,635
Everyone, get back,
all of you, as far as you can.

425
00:24:18,735 --> 00:24:20,136
Doctor, make her stop.

426
00:24:20,533 --> 00:24:22,654
Val, come on,
come to the back, stop looking at her,

427
00:24:22,754 --> 00:24:25,150
come on, Jethro, you too,
everyone, come on...

428
00:24:25,910 --> 00:24:27,393
50 minutes. That's all we need.

429
00:24:27,493 --> 00:24:29,520
50 minutes till
the rescue arrives. And...

430
00:24:29,814 --> 00:24:33,080
she's not exactly strong, look at her,
all she's got is our voices.

431
00:24:33,455 --> 00:24:35,333
I can't look at her.
It's those eyes.

432
00:24:40,513 --> 00:24:42,353
We must not look at goblin men.

433
00:24:45,505 --> 00:24:49,078
- What's that supposed to mean?
- It's a poem. Christina Rossetti.

434
00:24:54,878 --> 00:24:57,803
We must not look at goblin men.
We must not buy their fruits.

435
00:24:57,903 --> 00:25:01,526
Who knows upon what soil they fed.
Their hungry, thirsty roots?

436
00:25:03,103 --> 00:25:04,304
I don't think that's helping.

437
00:25:04,404 --> 00:25:08,150
She's not a goblin, or a monster,
she's just a very sick woman.

438
00:25:08,410 --> 00:25:11,349
- Maybe that's why it went for her.
- There is no 'it!'

439
00:25:11,449 --> 00:25:14,040
Think about it. That knocking,
went all the way round the bus.

440
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:15,209
Till it found her.

441
00:25:15,491 --> 00:25:17,682
And she was the most scared,
out of all of us.

442
00:25:18,971 --> 00:25:21,590
Maybe that's what it needed.

443
00:25:22,224 --> 00:25:24,527
- That's how it got in.
- For the last time!

444
00:25:25,050 --> 00:25:28,027
Nothing can live
on the surface of Midnight.

445
00:25:28,127 --> 00:25:31,093
Professor, I'm glad you've got
a definition of life in the universe,

446
00:25:31,193 --> 00:25:33,696
but perhaps the universe
has got ideas of its own, mm?

447
00:25:33,796 --> 00:25:35,543
Now trust me. I've got previous!

448
00:25:35,932 --> 00:25:37,633
I think there might well be some...

449
00:25:37,839 --> 00:25:41,049
consciousness inside Mrs Silvestry,
but maybe SHE's still in there.

450
00:25:41,149 --> 00:25:44,046
- It's our job to help her.
- You can help her, I'm not going near.

451
00:25:44,146 --> 00:25:45,378
No, I've got to stay back.

452
00:25:45,478 --> 00:25:48,188
If she's copying us,
maybe the final stage is becoming us.

453
00:25:48,288 --> 00:25:51,038
I don't want her becoming me,
or things could get a lot worse.

454
00:25:51,138 --> 00:25:54,013
- Oh, like you're so special.
- As it happens, yes, I am.

455
00:25:54,113 --> 00:25:56,478
So that's decided.
We stay back. And we wait.

456
00:25:56,710 --> 00:25:58,975
When the rescue ship comes,
we can get her to hospital.

457
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:02,710
We should throw her out.

458
00:26:04,456 --> 00:26:05,839
I beg your pardon?

459
00:26:07,847 --> 00:26:09,580
- Can we do that?
- Don't be ridiculous.

460
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:11,282
That thing, whatever it is,

461
00:26:11,382 --> 00:26:14,479
killed the driver, and the mechanic,
and I don't think she's finished yet.

462
00:26:14,579 --> 00:26:17,132
- She can't even move!
- Look, look at her eyes!

463
00:26:17,501 --> 00:26:20,670
She killed Joe,
and she killed Claude, and we're next.

464
00:26:20,770 --> 00:26:23,061
She's still doing it. Just stop it!

465
00:26:23,161 --> 00:26:24,710
Stop talking!! STOP IT!!!

466
00:26:24,810 --> 00:26:27,471
- Biff, don't, sweetheart!
- She won't stop!

467
00:26:28,506 --> 00:26:31,027
We can't throw her out though,
we can't even open the doors.

468
00:26:31,127 --> 00:26:32,992
No-one is getting thrown out!

469
00:26:40,639 --> 00:26:41,646
Yes, we can.

470
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:43,804
<i>Cos there's an air pressure seal.</i>

471
00:26:44,125 --> 00:26:45,439
Like when you opened cabin door,

472
00:26:45,539 --> 00:26:47,534
you weren't pulled out,
you had a couple of sec,

473
00:26:47,634 --> 00:26:50,119
<i>cos it takes the pressure-wall
about six seconds to collapse.</i>

474
00:26:50,219 --> 00:26:52,127
Well, six seconds exactly.

475
00:26:52,796 --> 00:26:54,942
That's enough time to throw someone out.

476
00:26:55,418 --> 00:26:58,421
- Thanks, Dee Dee, just what we needed.
- Would it kill her? Outside?

477
00:26:58,521 --> 00:27:01,513
I don't know, but she's got a body now,
it would kill the physical form.

478
00:27:01,613 --> 00:27:03,760
No-one is killing anyone!

479
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:06,465
I wouldn't risk the cabin door twice.
But we've got that one.

480
00:27:06,565 --> 00:27:08,898
All we need to do is grab hold
of her and throw her out.

481
00:27:08,998 --> 00:27:11,878
Now, listen! For all we know,
that's a brand new lifeform over there.

482
00:27:11,978 --> 00:27:14,555
And if it's come inside to discover us,
than what's it found?

483
00:27:14,962 --> 00:27:18,147
This little bunch of humans,
what d'you amount to?

484
00:27:18,891 --> 00:27:21,507
A murder? Cos this is where you decide.

485
00:27:21,607 --> 00:27:23,309
You decide who you are.

486
00:27:23,503 --> 00:27:26,475
Could you actually murder her?
Any of you?

487
00:27:26,981 --> 00:27:27,632
Really?

488
00:27:29,791 --> 00:27:31,470
Or are you better than that?

489
00:27:40,098 --> 00:27:40,950
I'd do it.

490
00:27:41,118 --> 00:27:42,113
- So would I.
- And me.

491
00:27:42,451 --> 00:27:43,765
- I think we should.
- What?!

492
00:27:43,865 --> 00:27:45,560
- I want her out.
- You can't say that!

493
00:27:45,660 --> 00:27:48,714
I'm sorry, but you said it yourself,
Doctor, she is growing in strength.

494
00:27:48,814 --> 00:27:51,082
- That's not what I said!
- I want to go home.

495
00:27:51,514 --> 00:27:53,835
I'm sorry. I want to be safe.

496
00:27:53,935 --> 00:27:56,288
You'll be safe,
the rescue truck is on its way.

497
00:27:56,388 --> 00:27:57,827
<i>What happens then, Doctor?</i>

498
00:27:58,389 --> 00:28:00,514
If it takes that thing back to
the Leisure Palace,

499
00:28:00,614 --> 00:28:03,074
if that thing reaches civilisation,
what if it spreads?

500
00:28:03,174 --> 00:28:05,579
When we get back to the base,
I'll be there to contain it.

501
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:08,480
- You haven't done much so far!
- You'r standing with the rest of us!

502
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:09,706
<i>She's dangerous.</i>

503
00:28:10,132 --> 00:28:13,230
It's my job to see this vessel is safe.
We should get rid of her.

504
00:28:13,330 --> 00:28:17,132
Now hang on, I think, perhaps,
we're all going a little bit too far.

505
00:28:17,232 --> 00:28:20,197
- At last! Thank you.
- Two people are dead!

506
00:28:20,297 --> 00:28:21,731
Don't make it a third!

507
00:28:25,303 --> 00:28:26,674
Jethro, what d'you say?

508
00:28:27,043 --> 00:28:28,651
- I'm not killing anyone.
- Thank you.

509
00:28:28,751 --> 00:28:30,634
- He's just a boy!
- What, I don't get a vote?

510
00:28:30,734 --> 00:28:32,710
There isn't a vote,
it's not happening! Ever.

511
00:28:34,206 --> 00:28:37,362
If you try to throw her out that door,
you'll have to get past me first.

512
00:28:40,878 --> 00:28:42,993
- OK.
- Fine by me.

513
00:28:43,093 --> 00:28:45,572
Oh, now you're being stupid.
Just think about it!

514
00:28:45,672 --> 00:28:48,306
Could you take someone
and throw them out of that door?

515
00:28:48,406 --> 00:28:49,235
Calling me a coward?

516
00:28:49,335 --> 00:28:51,230
- Who put you in charge?
- I'm sorry, but...

517
00:28:51,490 --> 00:28:53,333
you're a Doctor of what, exactly?

518
00:28:53,433 --> 00:28:54,684
He wasn't even booked in.

519
00:28:54,784 --> 00:28:58,532
Rest of you, tickets in advance.
He just turned up, out of the blue.

520
00:28:58,732 --> 00:28:59,807
<i>Where from?</i>

521
00:29:00,201 --> 00:29:01,490
I'm just... travelling,

522
00:29:01,590 --> 00:29:03,435
- I'm a traveller..
- Like an immigrant?

523
00:29:03,535 --> 00:29:06,952
Who were you talking to?
Before you got on board, who was that?

524
00:29:07,052 --> 00:29:08,042
Just Donna, my friend.

525
00:29:08,142 --> 00:29:10,364
- What were you saying her?
- Hasn't told us his name.

526
00:29:10,464 --> 00:29:12,810
Thing is, Doctor,
you've been loving this.

527
00:29:12,910 --> 00:29:14,437
Oh, Jethro, not you.

528
00:29:14,537 --> 00:29:17,396
No, but ever since all the trouble
started, you've been loving it.

529
00:29:17,496 --> 00:29:21,155
It has to be said,
you do seem to have a certain...glee.

530
00:29:21,255 --> 00:29:23,781
All right, I'm interested,
yes, I can't help it,

531
00:29:23,881 --> 00:29:26,152
cos whatever's inside her,
it's brand new,

532
00:29:26,252 --> 00:29:28,730
- and that's fascinating.
- What, you wanted this to happen?

533
00:29:28,830 --> 00:29:29,265
No!

534
00:29:29,365 --> 00:29:31,743
You were talking to her,
on your own, before the trouble,

535
00:29:31,843 --> 00:29:34,465
right at the front, you were
talking to that Sky woman,

536
00:29:34,565 --> 00:29:36,713
- the two of you together, I saw you.
- We all did!

537
00:29:36,813 --> 00:29:38,784
- You went in the cabin!
- What you said to her?

538
00:29:38,884 --> 00:29:40,333
- I was talking!
- Saying what?

539
00:29:40,433 --> 00:29:42,372
You called us humans
like you're not one of us.

540
00:29:42,472 --> 00:29:44,525
- He did! That's what he said!
- And the wiring,

541
00:29:44,625 --> 00:29:46,645
he went into that panel
and opened up the wiring.

542
00:29:46,745 --> 00:29:47,640
That was after.

543
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:50,645
- But how did you know what to do?
- Because I'm clever.

544
00:29:55,675 --> 00:29:57,685
I see. Well.

545
00:29:58,229 --> 00:29:59,649
That makes things clear.

546
00:29:59,749 --> 00:30:01,695
And what are we, then? Idiots?

547
00:30:01,795 --> 00:30:02,765
That's not what I meant.

548
00:30:02,865 --> 00:30:04,154
If you're clever what are we?

549
00:30:04,254 --> 00:30:06,510
You've looked down on us
from the moment we walked in.

550
00:30:06,610 --> 00:30:08,882
Even if he goes,
he's practically volunteered.

551
00:30:08,982 --> 00:30:11,948
Oh come on,
just listen to yourself, please!

552
00:30:12,048 --> 00:30:12,839
D'you mean...?

553
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:14,897
We throw him out as well?

554
00:30:22,847 --> 00:30:23,747
If we have to.

555
00:30:24,892 --> 00:30:25,806
Look, just...

556
00:30:26,744 --> 00:30:28,820
Right, sorry, yes, hold on, just...

557
00:30:30,010 --> 00:30:33,819
I know, you're scared,
and so am I, look at me, I am.

558
00:30:34,135 --> 00:30:38,155
But we have all got to calm down
and cool off and think.

559
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:40,232
Perhaps you could tell us your name.

560
00:30:40,332 --> 00:30:42,252
- What does it matter?
- Then tell us.

561
00:30:43,935 --> 00:30:45,692
- John Smith.
- Your real name.

562
00:30:45,792 --> 00:30:48,270
He's lying, look at his face.
His eyes are the same as hers.

563
00:30:48,370 --> 00:30:50,222
- Tell us?!
- He's been lying to us,

564
00:30:50,322 --> 00:30:51,254
right from the start.

565
00:30:51,354 --> 00:30:52,737
No-one's called John Smith!

566
00:30:52,837 --> 00:30:54,583
Now listen to me right now!

567
00:30:54,683 --> 00:30:58,239
You need me, all of you, if we're going
to get out of this, then you need me.

568
00:30:58,339 --> 00:31:00,830
So you keep saying!
You've repeated yourself more than her.

569
00:31:00,930 --> 00:31:03,651
If anyone's in charge, it should be
the Professor, he's the expert!

570
00:31:03,751 --> 00:31:05,559
Stop, just look...

571
00:31:05,735 --> 00:31:07,658
- You keep out of this, Jethro.
- Look at her!

572
00:31:08,071 --> 00:31:09,210
She's stopped...

573
00:31:14,672 --> 00:31:17,619
When did she...?
No, she hasn't, she's still doing it.

574
00:31:17,875 --> 00:31:19,270
<i>She looks the same to me...</i>

575
00:31:19,641 --> 00:31:21,875
No, she's stopped!

576
00:31:22,707 --> 00:31:24,673
<i>Look, I'm talking, and she's not!</i>

577
00:31:24,773 --> 00:31:25,956
<i>What about me? Is she?</i>

578
00:31:26,056 --> 00:31:29,790
Look! Look at that!
She's not doing me, she's let me go!

579
00:31:30,050 --> 00:31:31,405
Mrs Silvestry?

580
00:31:33,573 --> 00:31:35,219
Nor me! Nothing!

581
00:31:36,495 --> 00:31:37,427
Sky?

582
00:31:38,622 --> 00:31:39,555
What are you doing?

583
00:31:39,655 --> 00:31:41,112
She's still doing him!

584
00:31:42,370 --> 00:31:45,232
Doctor. It's you.
She's only copying you.

585
00:31:46,477 --> 00:31:48,867
Why me? Why are you doing this?

586
00:31:48,967 --> 00:31:52,827
She won't leave him alone!
D'you see? I said so, she's with him.

587
00:31:52,927 --> 00:31:55,046
- They're together!
- How d'you explain it, Doctor?

588
00:31:55,215 --> 00:31:57,399
- If you're so clever.
- I don't know.

589
00:31:58,575 --> 00:31:59,882
Sky, stop it.

590
00:32:00,783 --> 00:32:02,854
I said stop it. Just stop it!

591
00:32:02,954 --> 00:32:04,414
<i>Look at the two of them...</i>

592
00:32:07,008 --> 00:32:09,950
Mrs Silvestry. I'm trying to understand.

593
00:32:10,937 --> 00:32:13,484
<i>You've captured my speech, what for?</i>

594
00:32:14,729 --> 00:32:16,111
What d'you need?

595
00:32:19,243 --> 00:32:21,721
You need my voice in particular.

596
00:32:22,008 --> 00:32:23,823
The cleverest voice in the room.

597
00:32:24,279 --> 00:32:27,316
Why? Cos I'm the only
one who can help?

598
00:32:28,154 --> 00:32:31,102
Oh, I'd love that to be true.
But your eyes.

599
00:32:32,034 --> 00:32:33,520
They're saying something else.

600
00:32:34,618 --> 00:32:38,278
Listen to me.
Whatever you want, if it's life,

601
00:32:38,378 --> 00:32:43,337
or form, or consciousness,
or voice, you don't have to steal it.

602
00:32:43,437 --> 00:32:46,090
You can find it
without hurting anyone.

603
00:32:47,148 --> 00:32:48,530
And I'll help you.

604
00:32:49,231 --> 00:32:50,729
That's a promise.

605
00:32:51,323 --> 00:32:52,012
So.

606
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:54,425
What d'you think?

607
00:32:55,701 --> 00:32:57,891
- Do we have a deal?
- Do we have a deal?

608
00:33:02,661 --> 00:33:05,145
- Hold on, did she...?
- She spoke first.

609
00:33:05,245 --> 00:33:06,130
She can't have.

610
00:33:06,230 --> 00:33:08,020
<i>- She did!
- She spoke first!</i>

611
00:33:10,784 --> 00:33:16,377
Oh, look at that, I'm ahead of you.
Oh, look at that, I'm ahead of you.

612
00:33:16,477 --> 00:33:20,675
Did you see? She spoke
before he did! Definitely!

613
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:22,117
He's copying her.

614
00:33:23,249 --> 00:33:25,170
<i>Doctor? What's happening?</i>

615
00:33:25,270 --> 00:33:28,531
- I think it's moved.
- I think it's moved.

616
00:33:28,631 --> 00:33:31,597
- I think it's letting me go.
- I think it's letting me go.

617
00:33:33,020 --> 00:33:35,822
<i>What do you mean?
Letting you go from what?</i>

618
00:33:35,922 --> 00:33:38,510
<i>But he's repeating now,
he's the one doing it! It's him!</i>

619
00:33:39,266 --> 00:33:40,398
<i>They're separating.</i>

620
00:33:41,136 --> 00:33:42,431
<i>Mrs Silvestry?</i>

621
00:33:43,432 --> 00:33:44,567
Is that you?

622
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:48,578
Yes, yes, it's me.

623
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:50,179
Yes, yes, it's me...

624
00:33:50,279 --> 00:33:52,357
I'm coming back, listen.

625
00:33:52,457 --> 00:33:53,788
- I'm coming back...
- It's me!

626
00:33:53,888 --> 00:33:55,659
Listen. It's me!

627
00:33:56,110 --> 00:33:59,363
Like it's passed into the Doctor.
It's transferred. Whatever it is,

628
00:33:59,855 --> 00:34:01,110
it's gone inside him.

629
00:34:01,753 --> 00:34:04,281
No, that's not what happened.

630
00:34:08,844 --> 00:34:10,126
But look at her!

631
00:34:12,792 --> 00:34:15,607
Look at me, I can move...

632
00:34:15,707 --> 00:34:17,736
- Look at me...
- I can feel again...

633
00:34:17,911 --> 00:34:20,026
- I'm coming back to life.
- I can move...

634
00:34:20,126 --> 00:34:21,162
I can feel again.

635
00:34:21,262 --> 00:34:23,183
- And look at him.
- I'm coming back to life.

636
00:34:23,283 --> 00:34:26,700
- He can't move.
- And look at him, he can't move.

637
00:34:31,431 --> 00:34:33,283
- Help me.
- Help me.

638
00:34:33,383 --> 00:34:35,010
- Professor?
- Professor?

639
00:34:35,204 --> 00:34:38,188
<i>- Get me away from him.
- Get me away from him.</i>

640
00:34:38,370 --> 00:34:40,634
- Please.
- Please.

641
00:34:54,199 --> 00:34:56,645
<i>Oh, thank you.</i>

642
00:34:56,745 --> 00:34:58,610
Oh, thank you.

643
00:34:58,710 --> 00:34:59,948
<i>They've completely separated.</i>

644
00:35:00,048 --> 00:35:03,270
It's in him, d'you see?
I said it was him all the time.

645
00:35:03,370 --> 00:35:05,643
She's free! She's been saved!

646
00:35:05,743 --> 00:35:08,840
- Oh, it was so cold.
- Oh, it was so cold.

647
00:35:09,103 --> 00:35:11,483
- I couldn't breathe.
- I couldn't breathe.

648
00:35:11,583 --> 00:35:13,280
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.

649
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:15,136
I must've scared you, so much.

650
00:35:15,236 --> 00:35:17,032
<i>I must've scared you, so much.</i>

651
00:35:17,132 --> 00:35:20,645
No, no, it's all right,
I've got you, ooh, there you are,

652
00:35:20,745 --> 00:35:23,148
my love, it's gone,
everything's all right now.

653
00:35:23,248 --> 00:35:24,195
I wouldn't touch her.

654
00:35:24,295 --> 00:35:26,230
But it's gone, she's clean,
it passed into him.

655
00:35:26,330 --> 00:35:27,492
That's not what happened.

656
00:35:27,592 --> 00:35:29,344
Thank you for your opinion, Dee,

657
00:35:29,444 --> 00:35:32,590
but clearly, Mrs Silvestry
has been released.

658
00:35:32,690 --> 00:35:34,539
- No.
- Just leave her alone!

659
00:35:34,764 --> 00:35:36,484
She's safe, isn't she?

660
00:35:37,047 --> 00:35:40,350
- Jethro? It's let her go, hasn't it?
- I think so, yeah.

661
00:35:40,610 --> 00:35:42,990
Looks like it. Professor?

662
00:35:43,658 --> 00:35:45,873
I'd say, from observation...

663
00:35:46,286 --> 00:35:48,200
the Doctor can't move,

664
00:35:48,463 --> 00:35:51,510
and when she was possessed,
she couldn't move, so...

665
00:35:51,610 --> 00:35:52,814
Well, there we are then!

666
00:35:53,452 --> 00:35:56,180
Now the only problem
we've got is this Doctor.

667
00:35:57,556 --> 00:36:00,783
- It's inside his head.
- It's inside his head.

668
00:36:02,175 --> 00:36:04,728
- It killed the driver.
- It killed the driver.

669
00:36:04,828 --> 00:36:07,001
- And the mechanic.
- And the mechanic.

670
00:36:07,101 --> 00:36:08,618
And now it wants us.

671
00:36:08,718 --> 00:36:11,055
- And now it wants us.
- I said so!

672
00:36:11,217 --> 00:36:14,189
- He's waited so long.
- He's waited so long.

673
00:36:14,289 --> 00:36:15,922
- In the dark.
- In the dark.

674
00:36:16,022 --> 00:36:18,055
- And the cold.
- And the cold.

675
00:36:18,155 --> 00:36:20,520
- And the diamonds.
- And the diamonds.

676
00:36:20,620 --> 00:36:22,867
- Until you came.
- Until you came.

677
00:36:22,967 --> 00:36:24,644
Bodies so hot.

678
00:36:24,744 --> 00:36:25,802
Bodies so hot.

679
00:36:25,902 --> 00:36:27,723
- With blood.
- With blood.

680
00:36:27,823 --> 00:36:29,549
- And pain.
- And pain.

681
00:36:29,649 --> 00:36:30,751
Someone make him stop.

682
00:36:30,851 --> 00:36:32,984
- But she's saying it!
- And you can shut up!

683
00:36:33,084 --> 00:36:35,687
It's not him, it's her,
he's just repeating!

684
00:36:35,787 --> 00:36:37,577
But that's what the
thing does, it repeats!

685
00:36:37,677 --> 00:36:39,748
- Let her talk.
- What do you know?

686
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:41,131
Fat lot of good you've been!

687
00:36:41,231 --> 00:36:43,002
Just let her explain.

688
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:44,747
I think...

689
00:36:45,398 --> 00:36:47,022
I mean, from what I've seen...

690
00:36:47,122 --> 00:36:49,967
it repeats, then it synchronises,
then it goes on to the next stage

691
00:36:50,067 --> 00:36:51,950
that's exactly what
the Doctor said would...

692
00:36:52,050 --> 00:36:53,866
- What, and you're on his side?
- No!

693
00:36:53,966 --> 00:36:56,505
- The voice is the thing!
- And she's the voice!

694
00:36:56,694 --> 00:36:58,950
She stole it! Look at her!

695
00:36:59,484 --> 00:37:01,793
It's not possessing him,
it's draining him!

696
00:37:02,106 --> 00:37:03,163
She's got his voice...

697
00:37:03,263 --> 00:37:05,322
<i>That's not true,
I saw it pass into him,</i>

698
00:37:05,422 --> 00:37:07,311
- I saw it with my own eyes!
- So did I!

699
00:37:07,411 --> 00:37:09,570
- You didn't!
- It went from her, to him.

700
00:37:09,933 --> 00:37:11,172
You saw it, didn't you?

701
00:37:11,272 --> 00:37:13,018
- I don't know.
- Don't be stupid, Jethro,

702
00:37:13,118 --> 00:37:14,076
of course you did!

703
00:37:14,295 --> 00:37:16,630
- I suppose he was right next to her.
- Everyone saw it!

704
00:37:16,730 --> 00:37:18,512
<i>But you're just making it up!</i>

705
00:37:18,612 --> 00:37:22,152
I know what I saw,
and I saw her stealing his voice.

706
00:37:22,252 --> 00:37:24,079
She's as bad as him,
someone shut her up.

707
00:37:24,179 --> 00:37:25,612
I think you should be quiet, Dee.

708
00:37:25,712 --> 00:37:27,608
- I'm only saying...
- And that's an order!

709
00:37:28,139 --> 00:37:29,803
<i>You're making a fool of yourself!</i>

710
00:37:29,903 --> 00:37:32,806
Pretending you're an expert
in mechanics and hydraulics,

711
00:37:32,906 --> 00:37:37,511
<i>when I can tell you, you are
nothing more than average, at best!</i>

712
00:37:37,692 --> 00:37:39,445
Now shut up!

713
00:37:39,545 --> 00:37:41,769
- That's how he does it.
- That's how he does it.

714
00:37:41,869 --> 00:37:44,071
- He makes you fight.
- He makes you fight.

715
00:37:44,171 --> 00:37:47,130
- Creeps into your head.
- Creeps into your head.

716
00:37:47,230 --> 00:37:49,363
- And whispers.
- And whispers.

717
00:37:49,463 --> 00:37:50,670
- Listen.
- Listen.

718
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:52,548
- Just listen.
- Just listen.

719
00:37:52,648 --> 00:37:54,663
- That's him.
- That's him.

720
00:37:54,763 --> 00:37:56,709
- Inside.
- Inside.

721
00:37:56,809 --> 00:37:59,230
- Get him out of my head!
- Yeah, we should throw him out!

722
00:37:59,330 --> 00:38:01,221
Don't just talk about it!
Don't be so useless!

723
00:38:01,321 --> 00:38:03,636
- Do something!
- I will! You watch me!

724
00:38:03,736 --> 00:38:04,875
<i>I'm gonna throw him out!</i>

725
00:38:04,975 --> 00:38:06,277
- Yes!
- Yes!

726
00:38:06,377 --> 00:38:08,023
- Throw him out!
- Throw him out!

727
00:38:08,123 --> 00:38:10,219
- Get rid of him!
- Get rid of him!

728
00:38:10,319 --> 00:38:11,871
- Now!
- Now!

729
00:38:13,691 --> 00:38:15,418
- Don't!
- It'll be you next!

730
00:38:16,557 --> 00:38:18,064
I don't think we should do this.

731
00:38:18,164 --> 00:38:20,492
It was your idea!
Professor, help me.

732
00:38:20,592 --> 00:38:21,475
I can't...

733
00:38:21,575 --> 00:38:24,246
- I'm not...
- What sort of a man are you? Come on!

734
00:38:24,346 --> 00:38:27,430
Throw him out!
Just do it, throw him out!

735
00:38:27,878 --> 00:38:29,423
- Professor, help me.
- Get him out!

736
00:38:29,523 --> 00:38:31,801
Grab hold of him...
Not like that!! Are you stupid?!!

737
00:38:31,901 --> 00:38:33,627
- Cast him out!
- Cast him out!

738
00:38:33,727 --> 00:38:35,580
- Into the sun!
- Into the sun!

739
00:38:36,690 --> 00:38:38,820
- And the night!
- And the night!

740
00:38:39,690 --> 00:38:42,153
Come on.
Don't just stand there!

741
00:38:42,253 --> 00:38:44,431
- Do something say!!
- Get him out!

742
00:38:44,531 --> 00:38:45,663
- Do it!
- Do it!

743
00:38:45,763 --> 00:38:47,488
- Do it now!
- Do it now!

744
00:38:47,588 --> 00:38:49,353
- Faster!
- Faster!

745
00:38:49,530 --> 00:38:50,280
Just do it!

746
00:38:50,380 --> 00:38:52,700
- That's the way!
- That's the way!

747
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:54,950
- You can do it!
- You can do it!

748
00:38:55,678 --> 00:38:59,731
- Molto bene!
- Molto bene!

749
00:38:59,831 --> 00:39:00,535
<i>Get him out!</i>

750
00:39:00,635 --> 00:39:03,667
- Allons-y!
- Allons-y!

751
00:39:03,905 --> 00:39:05,375
That's his voice.

752
00:39:05,475 --> 00:39:08,155
- The starlight waits!
- She's taken his voice.

753
00:39:08,462 --> 00:39:10,789
- The emptiness!
- Get him out!

754
00:39:10,889 --> 00:39:12,716
The Midnight sky!

755
00:39:12,816 --> 00:39:14,211
<i>The Midnight sky!</i>

756
00:39:14,311 --> 00:39:15,337
It's her.

757
00:39:21,514 --> 00:39:23,430
She's taken his voice!

758
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:32,790
One, two, three, four, five, six.

759
00:39:37,699 --> 00:39:39,782
It's gone, it's gone...

760
00:39:41,140 --> 00:39:42,998
It's gone, it's gone, it's gone...

761
00:39:43,455 --> 00:39:44,415
It's gone.

762
00:39:44,913 --> 00:39:45,910
It's gone...

763
00:39:48,845 --> 00:39:50,430
<i>It's gone, it's gone, it's gone...</i>

764
00:39:51,129 --> 00:39:53,040
It's gone, it's gone, it's gone...

765
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:30,600
I said it was her.

766
00:40:47,025 --> 00:40:50,630
20 MINUTES LATER...

767
00:40:52,466 --> 00:40:57,972
<i>Repeat, Crusader 50, rescue vehicle
coming alongside in three minutes,</i>

768
00:40:58,478 --> 00:41:00,793
<i>door-seals set to automatic.</i>

769
00:41:01,331 --> 00:41:05,800
<i>Prepare for boarding,
repeat, prepare for boarding.</i>

770
00:41:06,866 --> 00:41:07,870
The Hostess...

771
00:41:10,464 --> 00:41:11,915
what was her name?

772
00:41:22,549 --> 00:41:23,619
I don't know.

773
00:41:56,553 --> 00:41:57,798
<i>What d'you think it was?</i>

774
00:42:00,588 --> 00:42:01,583
No idea.

775
00:42:02,985 --> 00:42:04,486
D'you think it's still out there?

776
00:42:08,744 --> 00:42:10,371
Well, you'd better tell 'em.

777
00:42:10,971 --> 00:42:12,630
- This lot.
- Yeah.

778
00:42:12,999 --> 00:42:15,163
They can build a Leisure
Palace somewhere else.

779
00:42:15,929 --> 00:42:17,649
Let this planet keep on turning.

780
00:42:17,749 --> 00:42:19,770
Round an X-tonic star.

781
00:42:20,615 --> 00:42:21,866
In silence.

782
00:42:23,893 --> 00:42:25,783
Can't imagine you, without a voice.

783
00:42:27,134 --> 00:42:28,430
Molto bene.

784
00:42:29,755 --> 00:42:31,150
Molto bene!

785
00:42:31,532 --> 00:42:33,090
No, don't do that.

786
00:42:35,003 --> 00:42:35,800
Don't.

787
00:42:39,558 --> 00:42:40,434
Don't.

788
00:42:47,582 --> 00:42:49,722
Found a body, sir.
The Doctor is dead.

789
00:42:49,972 --> 00:42:52,406
<i>How could anything...
be worse than this?</i>

790
00:42:52,825 --> 00:42:54,646
What happened, what did they find?

791
00:42:54,746 --> 00:42:57,335
Oh, my God. The stars are going out.

792
00:42:57,435 --> 00:43:00,023
- Who are you?
- I was like you.

793
00:43:00,123 --> 00:43:03,295
- Turn around... show me your back.
- I've been pulled across

794
00:43:03,451 --> 00:43:06,273
from a different universe because
every single universe is in danger.

795
00:43:06,373 --> 00:43:08,708
There's something on your back.

796
00:43:09,058 --> 00:43:11,842
- What am I supposed to do?!
- Powering up...

797
00:43:12,650 --> 00:43:15,671
None of this... was meant to happen.
You're going to die.
