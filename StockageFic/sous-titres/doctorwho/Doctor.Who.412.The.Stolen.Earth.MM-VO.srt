1
00:00:05,535 --> 00:00:06,549
It's fine...

2
00:00:08,201 --> 00:00:09,558
Everything's fine.

3
00:00:10,196 --> 00:00:11,796
Nothing's wrong. All fine!

4
00:00:12,447 --> 00:00:14,718
'Scuse me! What day is it?

5
00:00:14,818 --> 00:00:16,770
- Saturday.
- Saturday.

6
00:00:16,944 --> 00:00:17,695
Good.

7
00:00:18,585 --> 00:00:22,100
- Good, I like Saturdays.
- So, I just met Rose Tyler?

8
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:23,132
Yeah.

9
00:00:23,808 --> 00:00:25,610
<i>But she's locked away
in a parallel world.</i>

10
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:26,483
Exactly.

11
00:00:26,583 --> 00:00:28,879
If she can cross from her world,
to your parallel world,

12
00:00:28,979 --> 00:00:30,887
the walls of the universe
are breaking down.

13
00:00:30,987 --> 00:00:33,856
Which puts everything in danger,
everything!

14
00:00:35,583 --> 00:00:36,521
But how?!

15
00:01:07,949 --> 00:01:08,980
Thing is, Doctor.

16
00:01:09,798 --> 00:01:13,001
No matter what's happening,
and I'm sure it's bad, I get that,

17
00:01:15,866 --> 00:01:16,411
but...

18
00:01:16,711 --> 00:01:19,860
Rose is coming back.
Isn't that good?

19
00:01:22,139 --> 00:01:22,691
Yeah.

20
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:28,475
- What the hell was that?!
- It came from outside.

21
00:01:36,286 --> 00:01:37,754
But... we're in space.

22
00:01:38,386 --> 00:01:39,675
How did that happen?

23
00:01:40,119 --> 00:01:41,320
<i>What did you do?</i>

24
00:01:44,010 --> 00:01:45,581
We haven't moved, we're fixed...

25
00:01:48,308 --> 00:01:50,092
It can't have! No!

26
00:01:52,638 --> 00:01:55,280
The TARDIS is still in the same place.
But the Earth has gone.

27
00:01:56,957 --> 00:01:58,183
The entire planet.

28
00:01:59,672 --> 00:02:00,504
It's gone.

29
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:05,820
FAR ACCROSS THE UNIVERSE...

30
00:02:07,576 --> 00:02:08,609
<i>Right now!</i>

31
00:02:08,873 --> 00:02:12,336
<i>Confirm all stations on line,
can anyone hear me?</i>

32
00:02:12,436 --> 00:02:13,719
<i>Have you got contact...</i>

33
00:02:13,898 --> 00:02:15,100
What was that?

34
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:19,235
Some sort of earthquake, or...

35
00:02:21,218 --> 00:02:22,849
Jalandra, you all right?

36
00:02:24,729 --> 00:02:28,296
Is anyone hurt? We've lost power,
will someone get the lights back on.

37
00:02:28,396 --> 00:02:29,916
DaCosta, see to it right now!

38
00:02:30,786 --> 00:02:34,980
- Suzanne, are you OK?
- Martha.

39
00:02:35,454 --> 00:02:37,537
- Look at the sky.
- Why, what is it?

40
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,589
Just look at the sky!

41
00:02:40,697 --> 00:02:42,843
Whoa! What happened?

42
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:47,330
Was it the Rift?
Gwen, Ianto, you OK?

43
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,871
No broken bones.
Slight loss of dignity.

44
00:02:50,033 --> 00:02:52,657
- No change there then.
- The whole city must've felt that...

45
00:02:52,932 --> 00:02:55,253
- the whole of South Wales!
- I'll look outside.

46
00:03:02,839 --> 00:03:04,420
Little bit bigger than South Wales.

47
00:03:07,526 --> 00:03:10,220
Luke, are you all right?

48
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:15,539
Felt like some sort of
cross-dimensional spatial transference.

49
00:03:15,921 --> 00:03:19,381
But it's night! It wasn't night,
it was eight o'clock in the morning...

50
00:03:19,569 --> 00:03:21,100
Mr Smith! I need you!

51
00:03:24,007 --> 00:03:27,029
I wish you'd stop giving that fanfare,
you just tell me what happened?

52
00:03:27,129 --> 00:03:29,682
<i>Sarah Jane,
I think you should look outside.</i>

53
00:03:30,038 --> 00:03:32,963
<i>I think you'll find the visual
evidence most conclusive.</i>

54
00:03:34,075 --> 00:03:35,182
It's gone dark!

55
00:03:35,783 --> 00:03:38,229
It's them aliens, I'll bet my pension!

56
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:41,073
What d'you want this time,
you green swine!

57
00:03:41,173 --> 00:03:41,885
Dad...

58
00:03:42,248 --> 00:03:45,514
Look, you get back inside, Sylvia.
They always want the women!

59
00:03:45,614 --> 00:03:50,060
No, Dad, just look. Oh, my God.
Look at the sky!

60
00:03:53,311 --> 00:03:54,620
That's impossible...

61
00:03:54,814 --> 00:03:56,180
That's just impossible...

62
00:03:58,474 --> 00:03:59,888
It can't be...

63
00:04:17,929 --> 00:04:19,699
Right, now we're in trouble...

64
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:23,347
And it's only just beginning.

69
00:05:11,402 --> 00:05:13,567
But if the Earth's been moved,

70
00:05:14,389 --> 00:05:15,456
they've lost the sun!

71
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:17,002
What about my Mum?

72
00:05:17,665 --> 00:05:20,093
And Grandad? They're dead,

73
00:05:21,745 --> 00:05:23,034
aren't they? Are they dead?

74
00:05:23,134 --> 00:05:25,780
I don't know, Donna, I'm sorry,
I don't know...

75
00:05:27,307 --> 00:05:28,419
That's my family.

76
00:05:29,533 --> 00:05:32,540
- My whole world.
- There's no readings. Nothing.

77
00:05:33,306 --> 00:05:34,457
Not a trace.

78
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:38,340
Not even a whisper.
Oh, that is fearsome technology.

79
00:05:39,785 --> 00:05:41,820
- So what do we do?
- We've got to get help.

80
00:05:42,970 --> 00:05:43,864
From where?

81
00:05:45,052 --> 00:05:45,841
Donna...

82
00:05:46,655 --> 00:05:48,751
I'm taking you to the
Shadow Proclamation.

83
00:05:50,181 --> 00:05:51,340
Hold tight!

84
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:01,938
The United Nations has issued an edict,
asking the citizens of the world

85
00:06:02,038 --> 00:06:03,170
not to panic.

86
00:06:03,597 --> 00:06:04,623
So far,

87
00:06:04,723 --> 00:06:09,220
there has been no explanation of the 26
planets which have appeared in the sky.

88
00:06:09,767 --> 00:06:11,751
But it's an empirical fact!

89
00:06:11,851 --> 00:06:14,735
The planets didn't come to us,
we came to them!

90
00:06:14,835 --> 00:06:16,231
Just look at the stars.

91
00:06:16,331 --> 00:06:20,380
We're in a completely different region
of space, we've travelled.

92
00:06:20,642 --> 00:06:23,557
D'you know what, I look up,
and there's all these moons and things!

93
00:06:23,657 --> 00:06:25,020
Have you seen them?

94
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:29,154
I thought, what was I drinking
last night? Furniture polish?

95
00:06:31,106 --> 00:06:33,060
Ianto. Time and a place.

96
00:06:33,354 --> 00:06:35,701
- He is funny, though.
- Gwen, come and see!

97
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:38,799
Rhys, I've got no idea,
just stay indoors.

98
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:41,037
Can you phone my mother,
tell her, erm,

99
00:06:41,496 --> 00:06:44,118
oh, I dunno, just tell her to
take her pills and go to sleep.

100
00:06:46,133 --> 00:06:47,778
I'll come home as soon as I can,

101
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:49,524
I promise.

102
00:06:50,581 --> 00:06:52,527
I love you, you big idiot.

103
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:55,581
<i>Someone's established an artificial
atmospheric shell.</i>

104
00:06:55,681 --> 00:06:57,314
<i>Keeping the air and holding the heat.</i>

105
00:06:57,414 --> 00:07:00,192
Whoever's done this wants
the Human Race alive. That's a plus.

106
00:07:01,738 --> 00:07:03,842
<i>27 planets, including the Earth.</i>

107
00:07:06,601 --> 00:07:07,946
No, but what's that?

108
00:07:09,279 --> 00:07:10,555
That's not a planet...

109
00:07:11,043 --> 00:07:13,613
<i>The reading seems to be
artificial in construction.</i>

110
00:07:13,713 --> 00:07:16,897
Some sort of space station.
Sitting at the heart of the web.

111
00:07:17,229 --> 00:07:19,700
They're fine... Maria and her dad,
they're in Cornwall.

112
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:22,366
I told them to stay indoors.
Clyde's OK, he's with his mum.

113
00:07:22,585 --> 00:07:23,584
Sarah Jane,

114
00:07:23,684 --> 00:07:26,580
I have detected movement.
Observe.

115
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:28,195
Spaceships!

116
00:07:30,585 --> 00:07:32,362
Tracking 200 objects.

117
00:07:32,462 --> 00:07:34,194
Earthbound trajectory!

118
00:07:34,294 --> 00:07:38,698
Geneva is calling a Code Red.
Everyone to battle positions!

119
00:07:38,986 --> 00:07:41,589
Dr Jones, if you're not too busy.

120
00:07:41,689 --> 00:07:43,166
I'm trying to phone the Doctor, sir.

121
00:07:43,266 --> 00:07:44,065
And?

122
00:07:44,429 --> 00:07:45,692
There's no signal!

123
00:07:45,942 --> 00:07:48,970
This number calls anywhere
in the universe, it never breaks down.

124
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:50,428
They must be blocking it.

125
00:07:51,091 --> 00:07:52,480
Whoever 'they' are.

126
00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:54,373
We're about to find out.

127
00:07:55,086 --> 00:07:56,420
They're coming into orbit.

128
00:08:18,668 --> 00:08:20,260
The end of the world, darlin'!

129
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,366
End of the stinkin' world!

130
00:08:22,729 --> 00:08:24,036
Have one on me, mate.

131
00:08:36,346 --> 00:08:38,050
Right, you two.

132
00:08:38,262 --> 00:08:41,560
You can put that stuff down,
or run for your lives.

133
00:08:42,461 --> 00:08:43,718
D'you like my gun?

134
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,713
We're now getting confirmed
reports of spaceships.

135
00:08:52,813 --> 00:08:55,222
The Pentagon has issued
an emergency report.

136
00:08:55,416 --> 00:08:57,649
Dad, come and see!

137
00:08:58,340 --> 00:08:59,804
They're saying spaceships!

138
00:09:00,568 --> 00:09:03,852
- Did you find her?
- No, no, there's no reply.

139
00:09:05,085 --> 00:09:06,561
Where are you, Donna?

140
00:09:08,357 --> 00:09:10,077
Where are you, sweetheart?

141
00:09:10,828 --> 00:09:12,405
<i>3,000 miles and closing...</i>

142
00:09:12,674 --> 00:09:13,913
But who are they?!

143
00:09:17,185 --> 00:09:20,766
Martha Jones! Voice of a nightingale!
Tell me you put something in my drink.

144
00:09:20,866 --> 00:09:23,074
No such luck,
have you heard from the Doctor?

145
00:09:23,174 --> 00:09:24,012
<i>Not a word.</i>

146
00:09:24,112 --> 00:09:25,595
- Where are you?
- New York.

147
00:09:25,983 --> 00:09:28,045
- Nice for some.
- I've been promoted.

148
00:09:28,145 --> 00:09:31,336
- Medical Director on Project Indigo.
- D'you get that thing working?

149
00:09:32,812 --> 00:09:35,502
Indigo's top secret,
no-one's supposed to know about it.

150
00:09:35,703 --> 00:09:38,860
- I met a soldier in a bar, long story.
- When was that?

151
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:41,224
- Strictly professional!
- 1,500 miles, boys,

152
00:09:41,525 --> 00:09:43,671
and accelerating.
They're almost here.

153
00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:47,513
<i>I'm receiving a communication
from the Earthbound ships.</i>

154
00:09:47,613 --> 00:09:49,723
<i>They have a message for the human race.</i>

155
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:51,563
Put it through, let's hear it.

156
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:55,500
<i>Exterminate! Exterminate!</i>

157
00:09:55,828 --> 00:09:59,538
<i>Exterminate! EXTERMINATE!</i>

158
00:09:59,819 --> 00:10:02,645
<i>Exterminate! Exterminate...</i>

159
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:03,615
No...

160
00:10:03,715 --> 00:10:05,220
<i>EXTERMINATE!</i>

161
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,037
<i>Exterminate!</i>

162
00:10:07,307 --> 00:10:09,115
- Oh, no.
- What is it?

163
00:10:09,215 --> 00:10:11,009
Who are they?
D'you know them? Jack?

164
00:10:11,109 --> 00:10:15,050
<i>Exterminate, exterminate,</i>

165
00:10:15,682 --> 00:10:19,374
<i>exterminate, exterminate...</i>

166
00:10:20,576 --> 00:10:21,180
No.

167
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:23,210
There's nothing I can do.

168
00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:26,995
I'm sorry. We're dead.

169
00:10:27,095 --> 00:10:29,410
<i>Exterminate, exterminate...</i>

170
00:10:29,573 --> 00:10:31,797
Not Luke. You're so young.

171
00:10:31,897 --> 00:10:35,140
Exterminate, exterminate...

172
00:11:06,922 --> 00:11:09,740
Dalek fleet in battle formation!

173
00:11:10,325 --> 00:11:16,066
- All systems locked and primed!
- Crucible at 90% efficiency!

174
00:11:16,166 --> 00:11:19,119
The Human Harvest will commence!

175
00:11:20,683 --> 00:11:22,011
Battle stations!

176
00:11:22,299 --> 00:11:24,726
Geneva declaring Ultimate Code Red!

177
00:11:25,283 --> 00:11:27,780
Ladies and gentlemen, we are at war!

178
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:49,300
Supreme Dalek on the Bridge!

179
00:11:52,051 --> 00:11:55,208
Soon, the Crucible will be complete!

180
00:11:55,671 --> 00:11:59,667
We have waited long for this
ultimate destiny.

181
00:11:59,936 --> 00:12:03,820
Now the Daleks are
the masters of Earth!

182
00:12:04,774 --> 00:12:07,596
Daleks are the masters of Earth!

183
00:12:08,259 --> 00:12:11,140
Daleks are the masters of Earth!

184
00:12:14,999 --> 00:12:18,567
So go on then, what is
the Shadow Proclamation anyway?

185
00:12:18,667 --> 00:12:21,845
Posh name for police.
Outer space police. Here we go!

186
00:12:41,163 --> 00:12:44,898
Sco bo tro no flo jo ko fo. To to!

187
00:12:44,998 --> 00:12:49,736
No bo ho sho ko ro to so.
Bo-ko-do-zo-go-bo-fo-po-jo!

188
00:12:54,203 --> 00:12:54,977
Mo ho.

189
00:12:55,678 --> 00:12:57,974
Time Lords are the stuff of legend.

190
00:12:58,643 --> 00:13:01,860
They belong in the myths and
whispers of the Higher Species. You,

191
00:13:02,235 --> 00:13:04,011
cannot possibly exist.

192
00:13:04,324 --> 00:13:07,284
Yeah, more to the point,
I've got a missing planet!

193
00:13:07,384 --> 00:13:10,162
Then you're not as wise
as the stories would say.

194
00:13:10,262 --> 00:13:12,039
<i>The picture is far bigger
than you imagine.</i>

195
00:13:12,139 --> 00:13:14,787
The whole universe
is in outrage, Doctor.

196
00:13:14,887 --> 00:13:18,979
<i>24 worlds have been
taken from the sky.</i>

197
00:13:19,154 --> 00:13:19,974
How many?!

198
00:13:20,656 --> 00:13:22,446
Which ones?! Show me!

199
00:13:24,199 --> 00:13:25,919
Locations range far and wide.

200
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:29,392
<i>But all disappeared at the exact
same moment. Leaving no trace.</i>

201
00:13:29,492 --> 00:13:31,349
<i>Callufrax Minor. Jahoo.</i>

202
00:13:31,449 --> 00:13:33,560
Shallacatop. Woman Wept...

203
00:13:33,817 --> 00:13:35,825
Clom! Clom's gone!
Who'd want Clom?!

204
00:13:35,925 --> 00:13:37,335
All different sizes,

205
00:13:38,142 --> 00:13:39,550
some populated, some not.

206
00:13:39,650 --> 00:13:41,315
But all unconnected.

207
00:13:41,521 --> 00:13:42,722
What about Pyrovillia?

208
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:44,751
Who is the female?

209
00:13:45,032 --> 00:13:47,284
Donna! I'm a Human Being,

210
00:13:47,931 --> 00:13:49,305
<i>maybe not the stuff of legend</i>

211
00:13:49,405 --> 00:13:51,583
but every bit as important
as Time Lords, thank you.

212
00:13:52,316 --> 00:13:54,050
Way back when we were in Pompeii,

213
00:13:54,319 --> 00:13:56,133
Lucius said Pyrovillia had gone missing.

214
00:13:56,365 --> 00:13:59,449
Pyrovillia is cold case.
Not relevant!

215
00:13:59,549 --> 00:14:01,007
How d'you mean, cold case?

216
00:14:01,107 --> 00:14:03,394
The planet Pyrovillia
can't be part of this,

217
00:14:03,494 --> 00:14:05,183
it disappeared over 2,000 years ago.

218
00:14:05,283 --> 00:14:06,516
Yes, yes, hang on.

219
00:14:06,616 --> 00:14:08,493
<i>But there's the Adipose
Breeding Planet too,</i>

220
00:14:09,087 --> 00:14:10,671
Miss Foster said that was lost,

221
00:14:11,096 --> 00:14:12,980
but that must've been a long time ago.

222
00:14:13,499 --> 00:14:15,770
That's it! Donna! Brilliant!

223
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:18,380
Planets are being taken
out of time as well as space...

224
00:14:19,168 --> 00:14:20,700
Let's put this into 3-D...

225
00:14:21,853 --> 00:14:25,244
<i>Now, if we add Pyrovillia...</i>

226
00:14:27,634 --> 00:14:29,229
And Adipose 3.

227
00:14:31,955 --> 00:14:35,540
Something missing. Where else,
where else? Lost, lost, lost... Oh!

228
00:14:35,753 --> 00:14:37,580
The Lost Moon of Poosh!

229
00:14:45,119 --> 00:14:46,989
- What did you do?
- Nothing.

230
00:14:48,316 --> 00:14:51,220
The planets rearranged themselves
into the optimum pattern.

231
00:14:52,708 --> 00:14:53,943
Oh, look at that!

232
00:14:55,301 --> 00:14:59,236
27 planets in perfect balance.
Come on, that is gorgeous!

233
00:14:59,405 --> 00:15:01,860
Oi, don't get all spaceman,
what does it mean?

234
00:15:02,352 --> 00:15:05,414
All those worlds fit together
like pieces of an engine.

235
00:15:06,289 --> 00:15:07,490
It's like a powerhouse!

236
00:15:08,766 --> 00:15:11,350
- What for?
- Who could design such a thing?

237
00:15:12,026 --> 00:15:14,330
Someone tried to move
the Earth once before.

238
00:15:15,587 --> 00:15:16,895
Long time ago...

239
00:15:19,319 --> 00:15:20,433
can't be...

240
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:24,239
<i>Maximum extermination!</i>

241
00:15:27,185 --> 00:15:30,051
<i>The shields are down!
There's so many, abandon ship. </i>

242
00:15:30,151 --> 00:15:31,227
The Valiant's down.

243
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:34,248
Airforce retreating over North Africa!
Daleks landing in Japan.

244
00:15:34,348 --> 00:15:37,714
<i>We've lost contact with the Prime
Minister's plane... Jack! Manhattan!</i>

245
00:15:38,346 --> 00:15:41,236
- Martha, get out of there !
- I can't Jack, I've got a job to do.

246
00:15:41,336 --> 00:15:44,098
They're targeting military bases,
you're next on the list!

247
00:15:44,198 --> 00:15:46,831
Dr Jones, you will come with me.

248
00:15:46,931 --> 00:15:48,989
Project Indigo is being activated.

249
00:15:50,178 --> 00:15:51,148
Quick march!

250
00:15:53,767 --> 00:15:55,738
But we can't use Project Indigo,

251
00:15:55,838 --> 00:15:58,660
it hasn't been tested,
sir, we don't even know if it works.

252
00:16:00,221 --> 00:16:03,486
<i>Unit forces will be exterminated.</i>

253
00:16:03,586 --> 00:16:05,450
<i>Annihilate Unit.</i>

254
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,300
Exterminate!

255
00:16:22,116 --> 00:16:24,300
Put it on, fast as you can.

256
00:16:26,164 --> 00:16:29,868
Martha, I'm telling you,
don't use Project Indigo, it's not safe.

257
00:16:29,968 --> 00:16:33,117
You take your orders from UNIT,
Dr Jones, not from Torchwood.

258
00:16:33,473 --> 00:16:34,155
But why me?

259
00:16:34,255 --> 00:16:36,101
You're our only hope
of finding the Doctor.

260
00:16:36,408 --> 00:16:37,553
<i>But failing that,</i>

261
00:16:37,809 --> 00:16:39,411
if no help is coming,

262
00:16:39,586 --> 00:16:41,181
then with the power invested in me

263
00:16:41,281 --> 00:16:43,558
<i>by the Unified Intelligence Taskforce,</i>

264
00:16:43,658 --> 00:16:45,723
I authorise you, to take this:

265
00:16:46,818 --> 00:16:48,088
<i>The Osterhagen Key.</i>

266
00:16:49,909 --> 00:16:51,300
I can't take that, sir.

267
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:53,129
You know what to do.

268
00:16:53,442 --> 00:16:55,482
For the sake of the Human Race.

269
00:16:58,829 --> 00:17:02,399
<i>Daleks one five
reaching north corridor.</i>

270
00:17:02,499 --> 00:17:05,580
- Dr Jones... good luck.
- Exterminate, exterminate...

271
00:17:13,776 --> 00:17:15,202
Exterminate...

272
00:17:15,302 --> 00:17:16,097
Bye, Jack.

273
00:17:16,197 --> 00:17:17,260
Martha, don't do it!

274
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:21,575
DON'T!!!!

275
00:17:24,766 --> 00:17:26,149
What's Project Indigo?

276
00:17:28,489 --> 00:17:29,754
Experimental teleport.

277
00:17:29,854 --> 00:17:31,663
Salvaged from the Sontarans.

278
00:17:32,288 --> 00:17:34,803
But they haven't got coordinates,
or stabilisation.

279
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:35,880
So where is she?

280
00:17:37,075 --> 00:17:38,359
Scattered into atoms.

281
00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:41,562
Martha's down.

282
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:45,154
Commence the landings.

283
00:17:45,254 --> 00:17:47,415
Bring the Humans here!

284
00:17:47,515 --> 00:17:51,180
- Prepare the Crucible!
- Supreme Dalek,

285
00:17:51,437 --> 00:17:52,576
<i>is there news?</i>

286
00:17:52,676 --> 00:17:54,980
Earth has been subjugated!

287
00:17:55,975 --> 00:17:59,547
I mean, is there news of him?

288
00:17:59,716 --> 00:18:03,340
<i>Negative! No reports of Time Lord.</i>

289
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:06,368
We are beyond the Doctor's reach!

290
00:18:06,550 --> 00:18:12,027
Fascinating. If I had not elevated
you beyond crude emotions,

291
00:18:12,127 --> 00:18:15,740
<i>I could almost mistake
that tone for one of victory.</i>

292
00:18:16,418 --> 00:18:18,308
Beware your pride.

293
00:18:18,408 --> 00:18:20,629
The Doctor cannot stop us!

294
00:18:21,029 --> 00:18:25,271
And yet, Dalek Caan is uneasy.

295
00:18:28,430 --> 00:18:31,145
The Abomination is insane.

296
00:18:31,245 --> 00:18:32,453
Show respect.

297
00:18:32,691 --> 00:18:35,831
Without Dalek Caan,
none of this would be possible.

298
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:38,650
<i>And he speaks only the truth.</i>

299
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:41,073
He is coming.

300
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:47,140
The threefold man, he dances
in the lonely places.

301
00:18:47,507 --> 00:18:50,197
<i>Oh, creator of us all.</i>

302
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:53,303
The Doctor is coming...

303
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:20,900
<i>You need sustenance.</i>

304
00:19:21,870 --> 00:19:23,511
Take the water. It purifies.

305
00:19:24,438 --> 00:19:25,094
Thanks.

306
00:19:26,051 --> 00:19:27,628
There was something on your back.

307
00:19:29,792 --> 00:19:30,687
How d'you know that?

308
00:19:31,507 --> 00:19:33,029
You are something new.

309
00:19:33,962 --> 00:19:34,770
Not me.

310
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,141
<i>I'm just a temp.</i>

311
00:19:37,779 --> 00:19:40,169
Shorthand, filing,
100 words per minute,

312
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:42,698
fat lot of good that is now.

313
00:19:43,511 --> 00:19:44,563
I'm no use to anyone.

314
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:46,765
I'm so sorry for your loss.

315
00:19:48,350 --> 00:19:49,025
Yeah.

316
00:19:51,110 --> 00:19:52,540
My whole planet's gone.

317
00:19:53,211 --> 00:19:55,351
I mean the loss that is yet to come.

318
00:19:58,266 --> 00:19:59,205
God save you.

319
00:20:02,471 --> 00:20:04,811
Come on, think, Earth!
Must've been some sort of warning.

320
00:20:04,911 --> 00:20:06,870
Was there anything happening, like,

321
00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:10,035
electrical storms, freak weather,
patterns in the sky?

322
00:20:10,135 --> 00:20:11,424
Well, how should I know?

323
00:20:12,175 --> 00:20:13,523
Um... no,

324
00:20:14,324 --> 00:20:15,363
I don't think so, no.

325
00:20:16,245 --> 00:20:18,340
- OK, never mind.
- Although...

326
00:20:20,468 --> 00:20:21,801
there were the bees disappearing.

327
00:20:22,614 --> 00:20:23,780
The bees disappearing...

328
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,595
<i>The bees disappearing.</i>

329
00:20:27,603 --> 00:20:30,950
The bees disappearing.
How is that significant?

330
00:20:31,050 --> 00:20:32,727
On Earth we have these insects.

331
00:20:32,827 --> 00:20:35,120
Some people said it was pollution,
or mobile phone...

332
00:20:35,289 --> 00:20:36,446
Or, they were going home!

333
00:20:36,859 --> 00:20:39,356
- Back home where?
- The planet Melissa Majoria!

334
00:20:39,775 --> 00:20:43,573
- Are you saying bees are aliens?!
- Don't be so daft. Not all of them.

335
00:20:43,673 --> 00:20:46,236
But if the migrant bees felt something
coming, and escaped...

336
00:20:46,336 --> 00:20:47,262
Tandocca!

337
00:20:47,362 --> 00:20:48,707
The Tandocca Scale!

338
00:20:48,807 --> 00:20:52,073
It's wavelengths used as
a carrier signal. Infinitely small!

339
00:20:52,173 --> 00:20:55,160
It's like looking for a speck
of cinnamon in the Sahara, but look,

340
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:57,317
There it is. The Tandocca trail.

341
00:20:58,275 --> 00:21:01,491
The transmat that moved the planets used
the same wavelength, we can follow it!

342
00:21:01,591 --> 00:21:03,421
Find the Earth?!
Stop talking and do it!

343
00:21:03,521 --> 00:21:04,335
I am!

344
00:21:07,607 --> 00:21:08,564
We're a bit late.

345
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,706
The signal's scattered.
But it's a start!

346
00:21:15,373 --> 00:21:17,525
I've got a blip! Just a blip!
But definitely a blip!

347
00:21:17,625 --> 00:21:19,915
According to the Strictures
of the Shadow Proclamation,

348
00:21:20,015 --> 00:21:22,831
I will have to seize your
transport and your technology.

349
00:21:22,931 --> 00:21:24,260
Oh, really, what for?

350
00:21:24,542 --> 00:21:26,938
The planets were stolen
with hostile intent.

351
00:21:27,038 --> 00:21:29,935
We are declaring war, Doctor.
Right across the universe.

352
00:21:30,035 --> 00:21:32,675
And you will lead us into battle!

353
00:21:33,532 --> 00:21:35,413
Right, yes,

354
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:38,191
course I will.

355
00:21:39,098 --> 00:21:40,663
I'll just go and...

356
00:21:42,126 --> 00:21:43,153
get you the key.

357
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:52,423
Doctor! Come back!

358
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:57,500
By the Holy Writ
of the Shadow Proclamation,

359
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:00,277
I order you to stop!

360
00:22:00,377 --> 00:22:03,620
All Humans will leave their homes!

361
00:22:04,270 --> 00:22:07,193
The males, the females,

362
00:22:07,293 --> 00:22:10,780
the descendants, you will come with us!

363
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:13,020
Resistance is useless!

364
00:22:13,337 --> 00:22:17,893
- Where are you taking us?
- Daleks do not answer Human questions!

365
00:22:17,993 --> 00:22:21,543
- Stand in line!
- Dad, please come home.

366
00:22:21,643 --> 00:22:24,254
- They're leaving our street alone.
- Yeah, I've got a weapon!

367
00:22:24,354 --> 00:22:26,506
- It's a paint gun!
- Exactly!

368
00:22:27,038 --> 00:22:29,803
Them Dalek things,
they've only got one eye...

369
00:22:30,141 --> 00:22:32,492
Good splodge of paint,
they'd be blinded!

370
00:22:32,592 --> 00:22:34,954
We're not going! D'you hear me?

371
00:22:35,617 --> 00:22:37,813
Laura, get back inside the house!

372
00:22:37,976 --> 00:22:39,659
Simon! Get inside! Go!

373
00:22:42,973 --> 00:22:44,437
Get back in the sky,

374
00:22:45,194 --> 00:22:47,741
<i>get back where you came from,
and leave us alone!</i>

375
00:22:49,367 --> 00:22:52,144
Dalek attack formation seven.

376
00:22:56,031 --> 00:22:58,827
Maximum extermination!

377
00:23:05,793 --> 00:23:07,914
- They're monsters.
- Please, Dad.

378
00:23:08,014 --> 00:23:09,248
Come home.

379
00:23:13,021 --> 00:23:17,140
- Halt! You will come with me!
- Will I heck!

380
00:23:21,579 --> 00:23:24,432
My vision is NOT impaired!

381
00:23:24,532 --> 00:23:28,343
- I warned you, Dad!
- Hostility will not be tolerated!

382
00:23:28,443 --> 00:23:31,174
Exterminate! Exterminate! Exter...

383
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:44,150
- Do you want to swap?
- You're Donna Noble's family, right?

384
00:23:44,550 --> 00:23:46,615
I'm Rose Tyler. And I need you.

385
00:23:48,717 --> 00:23:50,919
I've tried calling her,
but I can't get through!

386
00:23:51,019 --> 00:23:53,541
But she's still with the Doctor,
I know that much...

387
00:23:53,744 --> 00:23:55,740
and the last time she phoned,

388
00:23:55,909 --> 00:23:58,700
it was from a planet called Midnight,
made of diamonds!

389
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:00,647
What the hell are you two on about?

390
00:24:00,747 --> 00:24:02,499
Look, she's out there, sweetheart.

391
00:24:02,818 --> 00:24:04,100
Your daughter.

392
00:24:04,557 --> 00:24:08,180
She's travelling the stars,
with that Doctor, she always has been!

393
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:10,842
- Don't be ridiculous.
- Oh, come on open your eyes!

394
00:24:10,942 --> 00:24:13,401
Look at the sky! Look at the Daleks!

395
00:24:13,501 --> 00:24:16,098
You can't start denying things now!

396
00:24:16,298 --> 00:24:19,084
You were my last hope.
If we can't find Donna,

397
00:24:19,835 --> 00:24:21,205
<i>then we can't find the Doctor...</i>

398
00:24:24,565 --> 00:24:25,900
Where is he?!

399
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:37,096
It's stopped.

400
00:24:37,896 --> 00:24:38,760
What d'you mean?

401
00:24:40,243 --> 00:24:41,331
Is that good or bad?

402
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:43,064
Where are we?

403
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:45,280
The Medusa Cascade.

404
00:24:55,702 --> 00:24:57,335
I came here when I was just a kid.

405
00:24:58,205 --> 00:24:59,412
90 years old.

406
00:25:00,801 --> 00:25:03,492
<i>It was the centre of
a rift in time and space...</i>

407
00:25:04,430 --> 00:25:05,093
<i>So...</i>

408
00:25:06,259 --> 00:25:07,820
where are the 27 planets?

409
00:25:08,273 --> 00:25:09,105
Nowhere.

410
00:25:10,444 --> 00:25:12,096
The Tandocca Trail stops dead.

411
00:25:15,894 --> 00:25:16,985
End of the line.

412
00:25:18,537 --> 00:25:19,763
So what do we do?

413
00:25:22,028 --> 00:25:23,786
Doctor? What do we do?

414
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:27,719
<i>Now don't do this to me.</i>

415
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:31,736
No, don't,

416
00:25:32,731 --> 00:25:33,740
don't do this to me.

417
00:25:35,202 --> 00:25:36,059
<i>Not now.</i>

418
00:25:37,179 --> 00:25:39,377
Tell me, what are we going do?

419
00:25:42,392 --> 00:25:43,581
You never give up.

420
00:25:45,771 --> 00:25:46,615
Please.

421
00:25:53,746 --> 00:25:56,699
<i>This is the Commander General
of the United Nations</i>

422
00:25:56,962 --> 00:25:58,664
<i>calling the Dalek Fleet.</i>

423
00:25:59,314 --> 00:26:02,604
<i>We surrender, repeat, we surrender.</i>

424
00:26:03,288 --> 00:26:05,220
<i>Planet Earth surrenders.</i>

425
00:26:05,541 --> 00:26:10,780
<i>Humans selected for testing
will follow Dalek instruction...</i>

426
00:26:11,623 --> 00:26:14,075
<i>The Daleks reign supreme.</i>

427
00:26:14,263 --> 00:26:16,559
<i>All hail the Daleks.</i>

428
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:21,480
<i>You will obey Dalek
instructions without question.</i>

429
00:26:22,149 --> 00:26:24,578
<i>You will obey your Dalek Ma...</i>

430
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:32,432
<i>Can anyone hear me?</i>

431
00:26:33,668 --> 00:26:35,595
<i>The Subwave Network is open.</i>

432
00:26:35,695 --> 00:26:37,522
<i>You should be able to hear my voice.</i>

433
00:26:39,443 --> 00:26:41,020
<i>Is there anyone there?</i>

434
00:26:41,397 --> 00:26:42,940
I know that voice.

435
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:46,383
- Who's that?
- Some poor soul calling for help.

436
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:48,700
- Can anyone...
- There's nothing we can do.

437
00:26:49,029 --> 00:26:50,005
But look at Mr Smith.

438
00:26:50,105 --> 00:26:52,714
<i>Processing incoming soundwave.</i>

439
00:26:52,946 --> 00:26:55,480
<i>This message is of
the utmost importance.</i>

440
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:56,740
<i>We haven't much time...</i>

441
00:26:58,424 --> 00:26:59,507
<i>Can anyone hear me?</i>

442
00:27:01,083 --> 00:27:02,516
Someone's trying to get in touch.

443
00:27:03,886 --> 00:27:06,100
The whole world's crying out.
Just leave it.

444
00:27:06,508 --> 00:27:09,180
<i>Captain Jack Harkness,
shame on you!</i>

445
00:27:09,669 --> 00:27:11,700
<i>Now stand to attention, sir!</i>

446
00:27:12,612 --> 00:27:13,350
What?!

447
00:27:14,389 --> 00:27:15,363
Who is that?

448
00:27:17,608 --> 00:27:20,224
Harriet Jones,
former Prime Minister.

449
00:27:20,543 --> 00:27:22,263
Yeah, I know who you are.

450
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:26,200
Harriet! It's me, it's me.
Oh, she can't hear me...

451
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:27,259
Have you got a webcam?

452
00:27:27,359 --> 00:27:29,420
She wouldn't let me,
said they're naughty.

453
00:27:30,855 --> 00:27:33,390
- I can't speak to her then, can I?
- Sarah Jane Smith,

454
00:27:33,689 --> 00:27:38,620
- 13 Bannerman Road... are you there?
- Yeah. I'm here! That's me!

455
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:42,100
Good... Now, let's see
if we can talk to each other.

456
00:27:46,383 --> 00:27:49,065
The fourth contact is having
some trouble getting through.

457
00:27:49,165 --> 00:27:51,096
That's me! Harriet! That's me!

458
00:27:51,377 --> 00:27:53,016
I'll just boost the signal...

459
00:27:54,061 --> 00:27:54,860
Hello?

460
00:27:56,107 --> 00:27:57,268
Martha Jones!

461
00:27:57,537 --> 00:27:59,214
Who's she? I want to get through!

462
00:27:59,314 --> 00:28:00,253
Martha, where are you?!

463
00:28:00,353 --> 00:28:02,693
I guess Project Indigo
was more clever than we thought.

464
00:28:02,793 --> 00:28:04,595
One second I was in Manhattan...

465
00:28:05,996 --> 00:28:08,902
<i>Next second...
Maybe Indigo tapped into my mind.</i>

466
00:28:09,002 --> 00:28:11,624
<i>Cos I ended up in the
one place that I wanted to be.</i>

467
00:28:14,714 --> 00:28:15,246
Mum!

468
00:28:19,190 --> 00:28:20,215
<i>You came home..</i>

469
00:28:20,678 --> 00:28:22,940
At the end of the world,
you came back to me.

470
00:28:24,064 --> 00:28:27,414
But then all of a sudden,
it's like the laptop turned itself on.

471
00:28:27,514 --> 00:28:29,778
It did. That was me.

472
00:28:30,891 --> 00:28:32,737
Harriet Jones,
former Prime Minister.

473
00:28:32,837 --> 00:28:34,780
Yes, I know who you are.

474
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:38,155
<i>I thought it was about time we all met.
Given the current crisis.</i>

475
00:28:38,255 --> 00:28:40,821
<i>Torchwood, this is Sarah Jane Smith.</i>

476
00:28:41,065 --> 00:28:42,572
I've been following your work.

477
00:28:42,923 --> 00:28:44,429
Nice job with the Slitheen.

478
00:28:44,773 --> 00:28:46,925
Yeah, well I've been
staying away from you lot.

479
00:28:47,132 --> 00:28:48,333
Too many guns!

480
00:28:48,834 --> 00:28:49,985
All the same,

481
00:28:50,623 --> 00:28:52,318
might I say, looking good, ma'am.

482
00:28:52,831 --> 00:28:54,178
Really? Oh.

483
00:28:54,529 --> 00:28:55,861
Not now, Captain.

484
00:28:56,443 --> 00:28:59,622
And Martha Jones,
former companion to the Doctor.

485
00:29:00,022 --> 00:29:01,129
Oi! So was I!!

486
00:29:01,229 --> 00:29:02,862
But how did you find me?

487
00:29:03,363 --> 00:29:06,535
<i>This, ladies and gentlemen,
this is the Subwave Network.</i>

488
00:29:06,791 --> 00:29:10,614
A sentient piece of software, programmed
to seek out anyone at everyone

489
00:29:10,833 --> 00:29:12,579
who can help to contact the Doctor.

490
00:29:12,679 --> 00:29:14,243
What if the Daleks can hear us?

491
00:29:14,343 --> 00:29:18,594
No, that's the beauty of the Subwave,
it's undetectable.

492
00:29:18,793 --> 00:29:20,576
And you invented it?

493
00:29:20,676 --> 00:29:24,330
I developed it. It was created
by the Mr Copper Foundation.

494
00:29:24,430 --> 00:29:26,569
<i>Yeah, but what we need, is a weapon!</i>

495
00:29:26,963 --> 00:29:29,153
Martha, back there at UNIT,
what did they give you,

496
00:29:29,253 --> 00:29:30,492
<i>what was that key thing?</i>

497
00:29:31,737 --> 00:29:32,914
The Osterhagen Key.

498
00:29:33,174 --> 00:29:37,326
That key is not to be used, Dr Jones.
Not under any circumstances.

499
00:29:38,193 --> 00:29:39,914
But what is an Osterhagen Key?

500
00:29:40,095 --> 00:29:42,216
Forget about the key
and that's an order.

501
00:29:42,936 --> 00:29:44,667
<i>All we need is the Doctor.</i>

502
00:29:44,992 --> 00:29:48,327
Excuse me, Harriet, but,
if you're looking for the Doctor...

503
00:29:48,427 --> 00:29:50,698
- didn't he depose you?
- He did.

504
00:29:51,166 --> 00:29:54,025
And I've wondering about that for
a long time. Whether I was wrong,

505
00:29:54,576 --> 00:29:56,661
but I stand by my actions, to this day.

506
00:29:56,761 --> 00:29:58,807
Because I knew, I knew that one day,

507
00:29:59,205 --> 00:30:02,874
<i>the Earth would be in danger,
and the Doctor would fail to appear.</i>

508
00:30:03,703 --> 00:30:05,044
I told him so myself.

509
00:30:05,144 --> 00:30:06,234
And he didn't listen.

510
00:30:06,334 --> 00:30:07,697
But I've been trying to find him,

511
00:30:07,797 --> 00:30:10,300
he got my phone, on the TARDIS,
but I can't get through.

512
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:12,206
Nor me, and I was here first!

513
00:30:12,306 --> 00:30:13,955
That's why we need the Subwave.

514
00:30:14,416 --> 00:30:15,667
To bring us all together,

515
00:30:15,767 --> 00:30:19,039
combine forces.
The Doctor's secret army.

516
00:30:20,097 --> 00:30:20,960
Wait a minute...

517
00:30:21,398 --> 00:30:22,918
we boost the signal! That's it!

518
00:30:23,475 --> 00:30:25,971
We transmit that telephone number
through Torchwood,

519
00:30:26,071 --> 00:30:27,634
using all the power of the Rift...

520
00:30:27,734 --> 00:30:29,114
And we've got Mr Smith!

521
00:30:29,487 --> 00:30:31,894
<i>He can link up with every
telephone exchange on the Earth!</i>

522
00:30:31,994 --> 00:30:34,527
<i>Can get the whole world to
call same number, at the same time!</i>

523
00:30:34,627 --> 00:30:36,486
Billions of phones,
calling out, all at once!

524
00:30:37,018 --> 00:30:39,026
Brilliant! Who's the kid?

525
00:30:39,689 --> 00:30:40,634
That's my son!

526
00:30:41,491 --> 00:30:42,648
But, excuse me, sorry,

527
00:30:43,042 --> 00:30:45,002
sorry, hello, Ianto Jones.

528
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:46,726
If we start transmitting,

529
00:30:46,826 --> 00:30:49,725
then this Subwave Network
is going to become visible.

530
00:30:49,825 --> 00:30:51,283
I mean, to the Daleks.

531
00:30:51,383 --> 00:30:55,035
Yes, and they'll trace it back to me.
But my life doesn't matter.

532
00:30:55,354 --> 00:30:56,550
Not if it saves the Earth.

533
00:30:58,020 --> 00:30:59,914
- Ma'am.
- Thank you, Captain.

534
00:31:00,906 --> 00:31:03,565
But there are people out there dying,
on the streets.

535
00:31:04,003 --> 00:31:05,917
Marvellous woman. I voted for her.

536
00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:07,234
You did not.

537
00:31:07,556 --> 00:31:10,116
Now enough of words. Let's begin!

538
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:15,736
Rift Power activated!

539
00:31:16,949 --> 00:31:18,470
All terminals coordinated!

540
00:31:27,789 --> 00:31:30,197
National grid online...
giving you everything we've got!

541
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:32,469
Connecting you to Mr Smith!

542
00:31:32,569 --> 00:31:34,194
All telephone networks combined!

543
00:31:36,226 --> 00:31:38,154
Sending you the number... now!

544
00:31:38,885 --> 00:31:44,834
Opening Subwave Network to maximum.

545
00:31:45,019 --> 00:31:46,308
Mr Smith...

546
00:31:47,541 --> 00:31:50,754
- make that call!
- Calling the Doctor!

547
00:31:51,682 --> 00:31:52,914
So am I!

548
00:31:54,574 --> 00:31:57,535
A-a-a-and sending!

549
00:32:19,883 --> 00:32:21,327
- Phone!
- Phone!

550
00:32:22,648 --> 00:32:24,080
Martha, is that you?!

551
00:32:24,873 --> 00:32:25,643
It's the signal!

552
00:32:25,743 --> 00:32:28,508
- Can we follow it?
- Just watch me!

553
00:32:30,854 --> 00:32:35,109
Emergency! Unknown network detected!
Subwave frequency!

554
00:32:35,209 --> 00:32:39,631
Find the point of origin.
Find and exterminate!

555
00:32:39,731 --> 00:32:42,078
<i>I warned you, Supreme One...</i>

556
00:32:42,491 --> 00:32:45,114
Just as Dalek Caan foretold.

557
00:32:45,462 --> 00:32:48,719
The Children of Time
are moving against us.

558
00:32:48,998 --> 00:32:52,652
But everything is falling into place.

559
00:32:58,802 --> 00:33:00,624
I think we've got a fix!

560
00:33:00,894 --> 00:33:02,562
Mr Smith, now at 200%.

561
00:33:07,203 --> 00:33:09,154
Oh, come on, Doctor!

562
00:33:19,726 --> 00:33:21,115
Find me, Doctor.

563
00:33:22,637 --> 00:33:23,776
Find me.

564
00:33:24,875 --> 00:33:26,915
Got it! Locking on!

565
00:33:33,293 --> 00:33:35,670
Harriet! A saucer's locked on
to your location,

566
00:33:36,052 --> 00:33:37,309
they've found you...

567
00:33:37,494 --> 00:33:40,863
I know. I'm using the Network
to mask your transmission. Keep going!

568
00:33:40,963 --> 00:33:42,714
<i>Exterminate!</i>

569
00:33:48,938 --> 00:33:50,633
We're travelling through time.

570
00:33:52,614 --> 00:33:56,101
One second in the future!
The phone call's pulling us through!

571
00:33:58,778 --> 00:33:59,834
Captain,

572
00:34:00,492 --> 00:34:05,114
<i>I'm transferring the Subwave Network
to Torchwood, you're in charge now.</i>

573
00:34:05,810 --> 00:34:07,299
And tell the Doctor from me...

574
00:34:08,119 --> 00:34:09,862
<i>he chose his companions well.</i>

575
00:34:11,532 --> 00:34:12,571
It's been an honour.

576
00:34:21,876 --> 00:34:24,003
Harriet Jones.
Former Prime Minister.

577
00:34:24,103 --> 00:34:27,181
Yes, we know who you are.

578
00:34:28,333 --> 00:34:30,316
Oh, you know nothing of any Human.

579
00:34:30,884 --> 00:34:32,393
And that will be your downfall.

580
00:34:34,458 --> 00:34:36,323
<i>Exterminate!</i>

581
00:34:46,414 --> 00:34:49,367
Three! Two! One!

582
00:35:05,658 --> 00:35:07,035
27 planets.

583
00:35:08,618 --> 00:35:09,594
And there's the Earth!

584
00:35:11,177 --> 00:35:12,554
<i>Why couldn't we see them?!</i>

585
00:35:13,188 --> 00:35:14,795
The entire Medusa Cascade

586
00:35:14,895 --> 00:35:17,711
has been put a second out of sync
with the rest of the universe.

587
00:35:17,811 --> 00:35:20,921
Perfect hiding place, tiny little pocket
of time. But we found them!

588
00:35:21,628 --> 00:35:24,191
Ooh, ooh, what's that?

589
00:35:25,073 --> 00:35:26,474
Hold on, hold on,

590
00:35:27,069 --> 00:35:28,914
some sort of Subwave Network...

591
00:35:31,667 --> 00:35:34,545
Where the hell have you been?!
Doctor, it's the Daleks!

592
00:35:34,645 --> 00:35:37,304
- He's nice I thought he'd be older.
- He's not that young.

593
00:35:37,404 --> 00:35:39,632
<i>The Daleks are taking people
to their spaceship...</i>

594
00:35:40,045 --> 00:35:41,755
Look, Doctor, I've got a son!

595
00:35:41,855 --> 00:35:43,325
It's not just Dalek Caan!

596
00:35:43,425 --> 00:35:45,534
- That's Donna!
- That's my girl!

597
00:35:45,953 --> 00:35:47,914
Sarah Jane! Who's that boy?

598
00:35:48,537 --> 00:35:49,914
That must be Torchwood.

599
00:35:50,459 --> 00:35:51,594
Aren't they brilliant?

600
00:35:51,854 --> 00:35:53,860
<i>Look at you all, you clever people.</i>

601
00:35:54,161 --> 00:35:58,146
That's Martha. And who's... he?

602
00:35:58,583 --> 00:36:02,474
Captain Jack. Don't. Just... don't.

603
00:36:03,238 --> 00:36:04,533
Doctor, it's me,

604
00:36:05,590 --> 00:36:06,679
I came back.

605
00:36:07,767 --> 00:36:10,330
<i>It's like an outer space Facebook.</i>

606
00:36:10,689 --> 00:36:12,011
Everyone except Rose.

607
00:36:20,031 --> 00:36:21,698
He is here.

608
00:36:22,299 --> 00:36:25,018
The Dark Lord is come.

609
00:36:25,554 --> 00:36:27,801
Supreme One, this Subwave Network,

610
00:36:27,901 --> 00:36:29,953
I would address it, give me access.

611
00:36:33,022 --> 00:36:33,807
We've lost them!

612
00:36:33,907 --> 00:36:35,714
No, no, no, there's another signal.

613
00:36:35,814 --> 00:36:38,567
There's someone else out there.
Hello? Can you hear me?

614
00:36:38,997 --> 00:36:39,694
Rose?

615
00:36:41,284 --> 00:36:43,558
<i>Your voice is different. And yet,</i>

616
00:36:44,599 --> 00:36:47,794
its arrogance is unchanged.

617
00:36:48,274 --> 00:36:48,740
No.

618
00:36:50,521 --> 00:36:51,623
But he's dead...

619
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:56,978
Welcome to my new Empire, Doctor.

620
00:36:57,814 --> 00:37:01,666
It is only fitting that you should bear
witness to the resurrection,

621
00:37:01,766 --> 00:37:04,567
and the triumph, of Davros.

622
00:37:04,667 --> 00:37:09,092
Lord and Creator of the Dalek Race!

623
00:37:11,696 --> 00:37:14,396
- Doctor?
- Have you nothing to say?

624
00:37:16,137 --> 00:37:17,418
Doctor, it's all right.

625
00:37:18,384 --> 00:37:21,176
We're in the TARDIS. We're safe.

626
00:37:22,424 --> 00:37:23,531
But you were destroyed.

627
00:37:24,839 --> 00:37:27,480
In the very first year of the Time War.
At the Gates of Elysium.

628
00:37:27,580 --> 00:37:30,564
<i>I saw your command ship fly into
the jaws of the Nightmare Child.</i>

629
00:37:31,096 --> 00:37:32,422
I tried to save you.

630
00:37:32,522 --> 00:37:34,731
But it took one stronger than you.

631
00:37:35,256 --> 00:37:37,314
Dalek Caan himself.

632
00:37:37,681 --> 00:37:41,172
I flew into the wild and fire,

633
00:37:41,294 --> 00:37:45,690
I danced and died a thousand times.

634
00:37:45,884 --> 00:37:50,282
Emergency Temporal Shift took
him back into the Time War itself.

635
00:37:50,514 --> 00:37:52,697
That's impossible!
The entire war is timelocked!

636
00:37:52,797 --> 00:37:54,806
And yet he succeeded.

637
00:37:54,906 --> 00:37:57,986
Oh, it cost him his mind.
But imagine,

638
00:37:58,272 --> 00:38:02,270
a single, simple Dalek succeeded where

639
00:38:02,895 --> 00:38:05,754
Emperors and Time Lords have failed.

640
00:38:06,381 --> 00:38:11,074
A testament, don't you think,
to my remarkable creations?

641
00:38:11,574 --> 00:38:13,651
And you made a new race of Daleks?

642
00:38:14,990 --> 00:38:16,750
I gave myself to them.

643
00:38:17,338 --> 00:38:18,759
Quite literally.

644
00:38:19,422 --> 00:38:23,976
Each one grown from a cell
of my own body.

645
00:38:26,963 --> 00:38:28,495
New Daleks.

646
00:38:28,770 --> 00:38:30,994
<i>True Daleks.</i>

647
00:38:31,567 --> 00:38:33,563
I have my children, Doctor.

648
00:38:34,795 --> 00:38:37,057
What do you have, now?

649
00:38:37,827 --> 00:38:39,028
After all this time.

650
00:38:39,616 --> 00:38:42,088
Everything we saw.
Everything we lost.

651
00:38:43,301 --> 00:38:45,914
I have only one thing to say to you...

652
00:38:46,377 --> 00:38:47,209
Bye!

653
00:38:51,363 --> 00:38:52,283
Emergency!

654
00:38:52,383 --> 00:38:56,043
Locate the TARDIS! Find the Doctor!

655
00:38:56,224 --> 00:39:00,153
He will go to the Earth,
to find his precious Human allies!

656
00:39:00,424 --> 00:39:02,388
And death is coming.

657
00:39:02,638 --> 00:39:05,341
Oh, I can see it.

658
00:39:05,441 --> 00:39:11,108
Everlasting death for
the most faithful companion...

659
00:39:11,208 --> 00:39:15,331
Subwave Network rerouted.
New location : Torchwood!

660
00:39:15,431 --> 00:39:21,033
Then exterminate them, at once!
Exterminate Torchwood!

661
00:39:23,673 --> 00:39:24,587
Gwen,

662
00:39:25,650 --> 00:39:27,781
Dalek saucer heading for the Bay.
They've found us.

663
00:39:28,957 --> 00:39:30,554
<i>Martha, open that Indigo device...</i>

664
00:39:30,814 --> 00:39:34,206
Lift the central panel, there's
a string of numbers that change...

665
00:39:34,306 --> 00:39:37,969
<i>The fourth number oscillates between
two digits, tell me what they are.</i>

666
00:39:38,399 --> 00:39:41,196
It's a four, and a nine,
we could never work out what that was.

667
00:39:41,966 --> 00:39:43,436
That's the teleport base code.

668
00:39:43,761 --> 00:39:46,201
And that's all I need,
to get this thing working again!

669
00:39:47,346 --> 00:39:49,843
Oscillating four and nine...

670
00:39:50,750 --> 00:39:52,114
Thank you, Martha Jones!

671
00:39:54,414 --> 00:39:55,340
I've gotta go,

672
00:39:55,934 --> 00:39:57,179
I've gotta find the Doctor,

673
00:39:58,862 --> 00:39:59,901
I'll come back,

674
00:40:01,771 --> 00:40:02,760
I'm coming back.

675
00:40:02,922 --> 00:40:04,593
Don't worry about us! Just go!

676
00:40:05,269 --> 00:40:06,829
- We'll be fine!
- You'd better be.

677
00:40:23,659 --> 00:40:27,624
<i>Exterminate! Exterminate!</i>

678
00:40:27,724 --> 00:40:28,791
They're here...

679
00:40:28,891 --> 00:40:30,862
TARDIS heading for Vector 7,

680
00:40:31,024 --> 00:40:33,463
- grid reference 665.
- But there are Daleks out there!

681
00:40:33,563 --> 00:40:37,856
I know, I'm sorry,
but I have got to find the Doctor...

682
00:40:38,628 --> 00:40:42,038
Don't move, don't leave the house,
don't do anything.

683
00:40:42,138 --> 00:40:44,402
<i>I will protect the boy,
Sarah Jane.</i>

684
00:40:45,531 --> 00:40:46,519
I love you.

685
00:40:47,170 --> 00:40:48,071
Remember that.

686
00:41:02,312 --> 00:41:03,827
Control? I need another shift.

687
00:41:03,927 --> 00:41:05,742
Lock me on to the TARDIS... now!

688
00:41:07,437 --> 00:41:09,602
Right, I'm gonna find them.

689
00:41:10,641 --> 00:41:11,554
Wish me luck!

690
00:41:11,869 --> 00:41:13,883
- Oh, good luck.
- Yeah, good luck, sweetheart!

691
00:41:26,501 --> 00:41:27,665
It's like a ghost town.

692
00:41:28,291 --> 00:41:31,475
<i>Sarah Jane said they were
taking the people. What for?</i>

693
00:41:31,575 --> 00:41:34,754
Think, Donna, when you met Rose in
that parallel world, what did she say?

694
00:41:35,318 --> 00:41:37,794
Just... the darkness is coming.

695
00:41:38,215 --> 00:41:39,197
Anything else?

696
00:41:43,484 --> 00:41:44,834
Why don't you ask her yourself?

697
00:42:31,543 --> 00:42:33,482
Exterminate!

698
00:42:45,926 --> 00:42:47,785
I've got you, it missed you.

699
00:42:47,885 --> 00:42:49,155
Look, it's me.

700
00:42:50,020 --> 00:42:51,722
- Rose...
- Hi.

701
00:42:53,021 --> 00:42:54,779
- Long time no see...
- Yeah,

702
00:42:56,012 --> 00:42:57,323
been busy, y'know.

703
00:42:58,334 --> 00:43:00,624
Don't die, oh, my God, don't die.

704
00:43:01,944 --> 00:43:03,333
My god, don't die.

705
00:43:05,354 --> 00:43:07,714
Get him into the TARDIS,
quick. Move!

706
00:43:11,335 --> 00:43:14,388
- But they don't work against Daleks!
- Well, I'm going out fighting.

707
00:43:14,563 --> 00:43:16,441
Like Owen... Like Tosh.

708
00:43:18,005 --> 00:43:19,034
How about you?

709
00:43:22,210 --> 00:43:23,361
Yes, ma'am!

710
00:43:26,345 --> 00:43:27,959
<i>What. What do we do?!</i>

711
00:43:28,916 --> 00:43:30,806
There must be some medicine,
or something.

712
00:43:31,075 --> 00:43:32,989
Just step back. Rose!

713
00:43:33,346 --> 00:43:34,785
Do as I say, and get back!

714
00:43:35,029 --> 00:43:37,222
<i>He's dying and you know
what happens next.</i>

715
00:43:38,029 --> 00:43:38,986
What d'you mean?

716
00:43:40,519 --> 00:43:42,496
Oh, no, I came all this way.

717
00:43:42,715 --> 00:43:44,392
What d'you mean? What happens next?

718
00:43:50,662 --> 00:43:51,714
It's starting...

719
00:44:08,364 --> 00:44:11,049
All Human transport is forbidden!

720
00:44:11,149 --> 00:44:15,391
- I surrender! I'm sorry!
- Daleks do not accept apologies!

721
00:44:15,491 --> 00:44:17,283
You will be exterminated!

722
00:44:17,458 --> 00:44:20,160
<i>Exterminate! Exterminate!</i>

723
00:44:26,630 --> 00:44:30,534
Exterminate. Exterminate.

724
00:44:35,083 --> 00:44:35,801
Here we go.

725
00:44:37,202 --> 00:44:38,310
Good luck, Doctor!

726
00:44:38,410 --> 00:44:42,493
- Will someone tell me what is going on!
- When he's dying, his body...

727
00:44:42,593 --> 00:44:44,372
it repairs itself. It changes.

728
00:44:44,917 --> 00:44:48,270
- But you can't!
- I'm sorry, it's too late.

729
00:44:51,033 --> 00:44:52,564
I'm regenerating.

730
00:45:35,826 --> 00:45:40,345
