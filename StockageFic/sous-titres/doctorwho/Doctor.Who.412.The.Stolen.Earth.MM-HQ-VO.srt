1
00:00:05,515 --> 00:00:06,529
It's fine...

2
00:00:08,181 --> 00:00:09,538
Everything's fine.

3
00:00:10,176 --> 00:00:11,776
Nothing's wrong. All fine!

4
00:00:12,427 --> 00:00:14,698
'Scuse me! What day is it?

5
00:00:14,798 --> 00:00:16,750
- Saturday.
- Saturday.

6
00:00:16,924 --> 00:00:17,675
Good.

7
00:00:18,565 --> 00:00:22,080
- Good, I like Saturdays.
- So, I just met Rose Tyler?

8
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:23,112
Yeah.

9
00:00:23,788 --> 00:00:25,590
<i>But she's locked away
in a parallel world.</i>

10
00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:26,463
Exactly.

11
00:00:26,563 --> 00:00:28,859
If she can cross from her world,
to your parallel world,

12
00:00:28,959 --> 00:00:30,867
the walls of the universe
are breaking down.

13
00:00:30,967 --> 00:00:33,836
Which puts everything in danger,
everything!

14
00:00:35,563 --> 00:00:36,501
But how?!

15
00:01:07,929 --> 00:01:08,960
Thing is, Doctor.

16
00:01:09,778 --> 00:01:12,981
No matter what's happening,
and I'm sure it's bad, I get that,

17
00:01:15,846 --> 00:01:16,391
but...

18
00:01:16,691 --> 00:01:19,840
Rose is coming back.
Isn't that good?

19
00:01:22,119 --> 00:01:22,671
Yeah.

20
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:28,455
- What the hell was that?!
- It came from outside.

21
00:01:36,266 --> 00:01:37,734
But... we're in space.

22
00:01:38,366 --> 00:01:39,655
How did that happen?

23
00:01:40,099 --> 00:01:41,300
<i>What did you do?</i>

24
00:01:43,990 --> 00:01:45,561
We haven't moved, we're fixed...

25
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:50,072
It can't have! No!

26
00:01:52,618 --> 00:01:55,260
The TARDIS is still in the same place.
But the Earth has gone.

27
00:01:56,937 --> 00:01:58,163
The entire planet.

28
00:01:59,652 --> 00:02:00,484
It's gone.

29
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:05,800
FAR ACCROSS THE UNIVERSE...

30
00:02:07,556 --> 00:02:08,589
<i>Right now!</i>

31
00:02:08,853 --> 00:02:12,316
<i>Confirm all stations on line,
can anyone hear me?</i>

32
00:02:12,416 --> 00:02:13,699
<i>Have you got contact...</i>

33
00:02:13,878 --> 00:02:15,080
What was that?

34
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:19,215
Some sort of earthquake, or...

35
00:02:21,198 --> 00:02:22,829
Jalandra, you all right?

36
00:02:24,709 --> 00:02:28,276
Is anyone hurt? We've lost power,
will someone get the lights back on.

37
00:02:28,376 --> 00:02:29,896
DaCosta, see to it right now!

38
00:02:30,766 --> 00:02:34,960
- Suzanne, are you OK?
- Martha.

39
00:02:35,434 --> 00:02:37,517
- Look at the sky.
- Why, what is it?

40
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:39,569
Just look at the sky!

41
00:02:40,677 --> 00:02:42,823
Whoa! What happened?

42
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:47,310
Was it the Rift?
Gwen, Ianto, you OK?

43
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:49,851
No broken bones.
Slight loss of dignity.

44
00:02:50,013 --> 00:02:52,637
- No change there then.
- The whole city must've felt that...

45
00:02:52,912 --> 00:02:55,233
- the whole of South Wales!
- I'll look outside.

46
00:03:02,819 --> 00:03:04,400
Little bit bigger than South Wales.

47
00:03:07,506 --> 00:03:10,200
Luke, are you all right?

48
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:15,519
Felt like some sort of
cross-dimensional spatial transference.

49
00:03:15,901 --> 00:03:19,361
But it's night! It wasn't night,
it was eight o'clock in the morning...

50
00:03:19,549 --> 00:03:21,080
Mr Smith! I need you!

51
00:03:23,987 --> 00:03:27,009
I wish you'd stop giving that fanfare,
you just tell me what happened?

52
00:03:27,109 --> 00:03:29,662
<i>Sarah Jane,
I think you should look outside.</i>

53
00:03:30,018 --> 00:03:32,943
<i>I think you'll find the visual
evidence most conclusive.</i>

54
00:03:34,055 --> 00:03:35,162
It's gone dark!

55
00:03:35,763 --> 00:03:38,209
It's them aliens, I'll bet my pension!

56
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:41,053
What d'you want this time,
you green swine!

57
00:03:41,153 --> 00:03:41,865
Dad...

58
00:03:42,228 --> 00:03:45,494
Look, you get back inside, Sylvia.
They always want the women!

59
00:03:45,594 --> 00:03:50,040
No, Dad, just look. Oh, my God.
Look at the sky!

60
00:03:53,291 --> 00:03:54,600
That's impossible...

61
00:03:54,794 --> 00:03:56,160
That's just impossible...

62
00:03:58,454 --> 00:03:59,868
It can't be...

63
00:04:17,909 --> 00:04:19,679
Right, now we're in trouble...

64
00:04:21,550 --> 00:04:23,327
And it's only just beginning.

69
00:05:11,382 --> 00:05:13,547
But if the Earth's been moved,

70
00:05:14,369 --> 00:05:15,436
they've lost the sun!

71
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:16,982
What about my Mum?

72
00:05:17,645 --> 00:05:20,073
And Grandad? They're dead,

73
00:05:21,725 --> 00:05:23,014
aren't they? Are they dead?

74
00:05:23,114 --> 00:05:25,760
I don't know, Donna, I'm sorry,
I don't know...

75
00:05:27,287 --> 00:05:28,399
That's my family.

76
00:05:29,513 --> 00:05:32,520
- My whole world.
- There's no readings. Nothing.

77
00:05:33,286 --> 00:05:34,437
Not a trace.

78
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:38,320
Not even a whisper.
Oh, that is fearsome technology.

79
00:05:39,765 --> 00:05:41,800
- So what do we do?
- We've got to get help.

80
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:43,844
From where?

81
00:05:45,032 --> 00:05:45,821
Donna...

82
00:05:46,635 --> 00:05:48,731
I'm taking you to the
Shadow Proclamation.

83
00:05:50,161 --> 00:05:51,320
Hold tight!

84
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:01,918
The United Nations has issued an edict,
asking the citizens of the world

85
00:06:02,018 --> 00:06:03,150
not to panic.

86
00:06:03,577 --> 00:06:04,603
So far,

87
00:06:04,703 --> 00:06:09,200
there has been no explanation of the 26
planets which have appeared in the sky.

88
00:06:09,747 --> 00:06:11,731
But it's an empirical fact!

89
00:06:11,831 --> 00:06:14,715
The planets didn't come to us,
we came to them!

90
00:06:14,815 --> 00:06:16,211
Just look at the stars.

91
00:06:16,311 --> 00:06:20,360
We're in a completely different region
of space, we've travelled.

92
00:06:20,622 --> 00:06:23,537
D'you know what, I look up,
and there's all these moons and things!

93
00:06:23,637 --> 00:06:25,000
Have you seen them?

94
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,134
I thought, what was I drinking
last night? Furniture polish?

95
00:06:31,086 --> 00:06:33,040
Ianto. Time and a place.

96
00:06:33,334 --> 00:06:35,681
- He is funny, though.
- Gwen, come and see!

97
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:38,779
Rhys, I've got no idea,
just stay indoors.

98
00:06:38,879 --> 00:06:41,017
Can you phone my mother,
tell her, erm,

99
00:06:41,476 --> 00:06:44,098
oh, I dunno, just tell her to
take her pills and go to sleep.

100
00:06:46,113 --> 00:06:47,758
I'll come home as soon as I can,

101
00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:49,504
I promise.

102
00:06:50,561 --> 00:06:52,507
I love you, you big idiot.

103
00:06:53,290 --> 00:06:55,561
<i>Someone's established an artificial
atmospheric shell.</i>

104
00:06:55,661 --> 00:06:57,294
<i>Keeping the air and holding the heat.</i>

105
00:06:57,394 --> 00:07:00,172
Whoever's done this wants
the Human Race alive. That's a plus.

106
00:07:01,718 --> 00:07:03,822
<i>27 planets, including the Earth.</i>

107
00:07:06,581 --> 00:07:07,926
No, but what's that?

108
00:07:09,259 --> 00:07:10,535
That's not a planet...

109
00:07:11,023 --> 00:07:13,593
<i>The reading seems to be
artificial in construction.</i>

110
00:07:13,693 --> 00:07:16,877
Some sort of space station.
Sitting at the heart of the web.

111
00:07:17,209 --> 00:07:19,680
They're fine... Maria and her dad,
they're in Cornwall.

112
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:22,346
I told them to stay indoors.
Clyde's OK, he's with his mum.

113
00:07:22,565 --> 00:07:23,564
Sarah Jane,

114
00:07:23,664 --> 00:07:26,560
I have detected movement.
Observe.

115
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:28,175
Spaceships!

116
00:07:30,565 --> 00:07:32,342
Tracking 200 objects.

117
00:07:32,442 --> 00:07:34,174
Earthbound trajectory!

118
00:07:34,274 --> 00:07:38,678
Geneva is calling a Code Red.
Everyone to battle positions!

119
00:07:38,966 --> 00:07:41,569
Dr Jones, if you're not too busy.

120
00:07:41,669 --> 00:07:43,146
I'm trying to phone the Doctor, sir.

121
00:07:43,246 --> 00:07:44,045
And?

122
00:07:44,409 --> 00:07:45,672
There's no signal!

123
00:07:45,922 --> 00:07:48,950
This number calls anywhere
in the universe, it never breaks down.

124
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:50,408
They must be blocking it.

125
00:07:51,071 --> 00:07:52,460
Whoever 'they' are.

126
00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:54,353
We're about to find out.

127
00:07:55,066 --> 00:07:56,400
They're coming into orbit.

128
00:08:18,648 --> 00:08:20,240
The end of the world, darlin'!

129
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:22,346
End of the stinkin' world!

130
00:08:22,709 --> 00:08:24,016
Have one on me, mate.

131
00:08:36,326 --> 00:08:38,030
Right, you two.

132
00:08:38,242 --> 00:08:41,540
You can put that stuff down,
or run for your lives.

133
00:08:42,441 --> 00:08:43,698
D'you like my gun?

134
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:52,693
We're now getting confirmed
reports of spaceships.

135
00:08:52,793 --> 00:08:55,202
The Pentagon has issued
an emergency report.

136
00:08:55,396 --> 00:08:57,629
Dad, come and see!

137
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,784
They're saying spaceships!

138
00:09:00,548 --> 00:09:03,832
- Did you find her?
- No, no, there's no reply.

139
00:09:05,065 --> 00:09:06,541
Where are you, Donna?

140
00:09:08,337 --> 00:09:10,057
Where are you, sweetheart?

141
00:09:10,808 --> 00:09:12,385
<i>3,000 miles and closing...</i>

142
00:09:12,654 --> 00:09:13,893
But who are they?!

143
00:09:17,165 --> 00:09:20,746
Martha Jones! Voice of a nightingale!
Tell me you put something in my drink.

144
00:09:20,846 --> 00:09:23,054
No such luck,
have you heard from the Doctor?

145
00:09:23,154 --> 00:09:23,992
<i>Not a word.</i>

146
00:09:24,092 --> 00:09:25,575
- Where are you?
- New York.

147
00:09:25,963 --> 00:09:28,025
- Nice for some.
- I've been promoted.

148
00:09:28,125 --> 00:09:31,316
- Medical Director on Project Indigo.
- D'you get that thing working?

149
00:09:32,792 --> 00:09:35,482
Indigo's top secret,
no-one's supposed to know about it.

150
00:09:35,683 --> 00:09:38,840
- I met a soldier in a bar, long story.
- When was that?

151
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:41,204
- Strictly professional!
- 1,500 miles, boys,

152
00:09:41,505 --> 00:09:43,651
and accelerating.
They're almost here.

153
00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:47,493
<i>I'm receiving a communication
from the Earthbound ships.</i>

154
00:09:47,593 --> 00:09:49,703
<i>They have a message for the human race.</i>

155
00:09:49,803 --> 00:09:51,543
Put it through, let's hear it.

156
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:55,480
<i>Exterminate! Exterminate!</i>

157
00:09:55,808 --> 00:09:59,518
<i>Exterminate! EXTERMINATE!</i>

158
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:02,625
<i>Exterminate! Exterminate...</i>

159
00:10:02,819 --> 00:10:03,595
No...

160
00:10:03,695 --> 00:10:05,200
<i>EXTERMINATE!</i>

161
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:07,017
<i>Exterminate!</i>

162
00:10:07,287 --> 00:10:09,095
- Oh, no.
- What is it?

163
00:10:09,195 --> 00:10:10,989
Who are they?
D'you know them? Jack?

164
00:10:11,089 --> 00:10:15,030
<i>Exterminate, exterminate,</i>

165
00:10:15,662 --> 00:10:19,354
<i>exterminate, exterminate...</i>

166
00:10:20,556 --> 00:10:21,160
No.

167
00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:23,190
There's nothing I can do.

168
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:26,975
I'm sorry. We're dead.

169
00:10:27,075 --> 00:10:29,390
<i>Exterminate, exterminate...</i>

170
00:10:29,553 --> 00:10:31,777
Not Luke. You're so young.

171
00:10:31,877 --> 00:10:35,120
Exterminate, exterminate...

172
00:11:06,902 --> 00:11:09,720
Dalek fleet in battle formation!

173
00:11:10,305 --> 00:11:16,046
- All systems locked and primed!
- Crucible at 90% efficiency!

174
00:11:16,146 --> 00:11:19,099
The Human Harvest will commence!

175
00:11:20,663 --> 00:11:21,991
Battle stations!

176
00:11:22,279 --> 00:11:24,706
Geneva declaring Ultimate Code Red!

177
00:11:25,263 --> 00:11:27,760
Ladies and gentlemen, we are at war!

178
00:11:46,519 --> 00:11:49,280
Supreme Dalek on the Bridge!

179
00:11:52,031 --> 00:11:55,188
Soon, the Crucible will be complete!

180
00:11:55,651 --> 00:11:59,647
We have waited long for this
ultimate destiny.

181
00:11:59,916 --> 00:12:03,800
Now the Daleks are
the masters of Earth!

182
00:12:04,754 --> 00:12:07,576
Daleks are the masters of Earth!

183
00:12:08,239 --> 00:12:11,120
Daleks are the masters of Earth!

184
00:12:14,979 --> 00:12:18,547
So go on then, what is
the Shadow Proclamation anyway?

185
00:12:18,647 --> 00:12:21,825
Posh name for police.
Outer space police. Here we go!

186
00:12:41,143 --> 00:12:44,878
Sco bo tro no flo jo ko fo. To to!

187
00:12:44,978 --> 00:12:49,716
No bo ho sho ko ro to so.
Bo-ko-do-zo-go-bo-fo-po-jo!

188
00:12:54,183 --> 00:12:54,957
Mo ho.

189
00:12:55,658 --> 00:12:57,954
Time Lords are the stuff of legend.

190
00:12:58,623 --> 00:13:01,840
They belong in the myths and
whispers of the Higher Species. You,

191
00:13:02,215 --> 00:13:03,991
cannot possibly exist.

192
00:13:04,304 --> 00:13:07,264
Yeah, more to the point,
I've got a missing planet!

193
00:13:07,364 --> 00:13:10,142
Then you're not as wise
as the stories would say.

194
00:13:10,242 --> 00:13:12,019
<i>The picture is far bigger
than you imagine.</i>

195
00:13:12,119 --> 00:13:14,767
The whole universe
is in outrage, Doctor.

196
00:13:14,867 --> 00:13:18,959
<i>24 worlds have been
taken from the sky.</i>

197
00:13:19,134 --> 00:13:19,954
How many?!

198
00:13:20,636 --> 00:13:22,426
Which ones?! Show me!

199
00:13:24,179 --> 00:13:25,899
Locations range far and wide.

200
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:29,372
<i>But all disappeared at the exact
same moment. Leaving no trace.</i>

201
00:13:29,472 --> 00:13:31,329
<i>Callufrax Minor. Jahoo.</i>

202
00:13:31,429 --> 00:13:33,540
Shallacatop. Woman Wept...

203
00:13:33,797 --> 00:13:35,805
Clom! Clom's gone!
Who'd want Clom?!

204
00:13:35,905 --> 00:13:37,315
All different sizes,

205
00:13:38,122 --> 00:13:39,530
some populated, some not.

206
00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:41,295
But all unconnected.

207
00:13:41,501 --> 00:13:42,702
What about Pyrovillia?

208
00:13:42,802 --> 00:13:44,731
Who is the female?

209
00:13:45,012 --> 00:13:47,264
Donna! I'm a Human Being,

210
00:13:47,911 --> 00:13:49,285
<i>maybe not the stuff of legend</i>

211
00:13:49,385 --> 00:13:51,563
but every bit as important
as Time Lords, thank you.

212
00:13:52,296 --> 00:13:54,030
Way back when we were in Pompeii,

213
00:13:54,299 --> 00:13:56,113
Lucius said Pyrovillia had gone missing.

214
00:13:56,345 --> 00:13:59,429
Pyrovillia is cold case.
Not relevant!

215
00:13:59,529 --> 00:14:00,987
How d'you mean, cold case?

216
00:14:01,087 --> 00:14:03,374
The planet Pyrovillia
can't be part of this,

217
00:14:03,474 --> 00:14:05,163
it disappeared over 2,000 years ago.

218
00:14:05,263 --> 00:14:06,496
Yes, yes, hang on.

219
00:14:06,596 --> 00:14:08,473
<i>But there's the Adipose
Breeding Planet too,</i>

220
00:14:09,067 --> 00:14:10,651
Miss Foster said that was lost,

221
00:14:11,076 --> 00:14:12,960
but that must've been a long time ago.

222
00:14:13,479 --> 00:14:15,750
That's it! Donna! Brilliant!

223
00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:18,360
Planets are being taken
out of time as well as space...

224
00:14:19,148 --> 00:14:20,680
Let's put this into 3-D...

225
00:14:21,833 --> 00:14:25,224
<i>Now, if we add Pyrovillia...</i>

226
00:14:27,614 --> 00:14:29,209
And Adipose 3.

227
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:35,520
Something missing. Where else,
where else? Lost, lost, lost... Oh!

228
00:14:35,733 --> 00:14:37,560
The Lost Moon of Poosh!

229
00:14:45,099 --> 00:14:46,969
- What did you do?
- Nothing.

230
00:14:48,296 --> 00:14:51,200
The planets rearranged themselves
into the optimum pattern.

231
00:14:52,688 --> 00:14:53,923
Oh, look at that!

232
00:14:55,281 --> 00:14:59,216
27 planets in perfect balance.
Come on, that is gorgeous!

233
00:14:59,385 --> 00:15:01,840
Oi, don't get all spaceman,
what does it mean?

234
00:15:02,332 --> 00:15:05,394
All those worlds fit together
like pieces of an engine.

235
00:15:06,269 --> 00:15:07,470
It's like a powerhouse!

236
00:15:08,746 --> 00:15:11,330
- What for?
- Who could design such a thing?

237
00:15:12,006 --> 00:15:14,310
Someone tried to move
the Earth once before.

238
00:15:15,567 --> 00:15:16,875
Long time ago...

239
00:15:19,299 --> 00:15:20,413
can't be...

240
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:24,219
<i>Maximum extermination!</i>

241
00:15:27,165 --> 00:15:30,031
<i>The shields are down!
There's so many, abandon ship. </i>

242
00:15:30,131 --> 00:15:31,207
The Valiant's down.

243
00:15:31,307 --> 00:15:34,228
Airforce retreating over North Africa!
Daleks landing in Japan.

244
00:15:34,328 --> 00:15:37,694
<i>We've lost contact with the Prime
Minister's plane... Jack! Manhattan!</i>

245
00:15:38,326 --> 00:15:41,216
- Martha, get out of there !
- I can't Jack, I've got a job to do.

246
00:15:41,316 --> 00:15:44,078
They're targeting military bases,
you're next on the list!

247
00:15:44,178 --> 00:15:46,811
Dr Jones, you will come with me.

248
00:15:46,911 --> 00:15:48,969
Project Indigo is being activated.

249
00:15:50,158 --> 00:15:51,128
Quick march!

250
00:15:53,747 --> 00:15:55,718
But we can't use Project Indigo,

251
00:15:55,818 --> 00:15:58,640
it hasn't been tested,
sir, we don't even know if it works.

252
00:16:00,201 --> 00:16:03,466
<i>Unit forces will be exterminated.</i>

253
00:16:03,566 --> 00:16:05,430
<i>Annihilate Unit.</i>

254
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:14,280
Exterminate!

255
00:16:22,096 --> 00:16:24,280
Put it on, fast as you can.

256
00:16:26,144 --> 00:16:29,848
Martha, I'm telling you,
don't use Project Indigo, it's not safe.

257
00:16:29,948 --> 00:16:33,097
You take your orders from UNIT,
Dr Jones, not from Torchwood.

258
00:16:33,453 --> 00:16:34,135
But why me?

259
00:16:34,235 --> 00:16:36,081
You're our only hope
of finding the Doctor.

260
00:16:36,388 --> 00:16:37,533
<i>But failing that,</i>

261
00:16:37,789 --> 00:16:39,391
if no help is coming,

262
00:16:39,566 --> 00:16:41,161
then with the power invested in me

263
00:16:41,261 --> 00:16:43,538
<i>by the Unified Intelligence Taskforce,</i>

264
00:16:43,638 --> 00:16:45,703
I authorise you, to take this:

265
00:16:46,798 --> 00:16:48,068
<i>The Osterhagen Key.</i>

266
00:16:49,889 --> 00:16:51,280
I can't take that, sir.

267
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:53,109
You know what to do.

268
00:16:53,422 --> 00:16:55,462
For the sake of the Human Race.

269
00:16:58,809 --> 00:17:02,379
<i>Daleks one five
reaching north corridor.</i>

270
00:17:02,479 --> 00:17:05,560
- Dr Jones... good luck.
- Exterminate, exterminate...

271
00:17:13,756 --> 00:17:15,182
Exterminate...

272
00:17:15,282 --> 00:17:16,077
Bye, Jack.

273
00:17:16,177 --> 00:17:17,240
Martha, don't do it!

274
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:21,555
DON'T!!!!

275
00:17:24,746 --> 00:17:26,129
What's Project Indigo?

276
00:17:28,469 --> 00:17:29,734
Experimental teleport.

277
00:17:29,834 --> 00:17:31,643
Salvaged from the Sontarans.

278
00:17:32,268 --> 00:17:34,783
But they haven't got coordinates,
or stabilisation.

279
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:35,860
So where is she?

280
00:17:37,055 --> 00:17:38,339
Scattered into atoms.

281
00:17:40,610 --> 00:17:41,542
Martha's down.

282
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:45,134
Commence the landings.

283
00:17:45,234 --> 00:17:47,395
Bring the Humans here!

284
00:17:47,495 --> 00:17:51,160
- Prepare the Crucible!
- Supreme Dalek,

285
00:17:51,417 --> 00:17:52,556
<i>is there news?</i>

286
00:17:52,656 --> 00:17:54,960
Earth has been subjugated!

287
00:17:55,955 --> 00:17:59,527
I mean, is there news of him?

288
00:17:59,696 --> 00:18:03,320
<i>Negative! No reports of Time Lord.</i>

289
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:06,348
We are beyond the Doctor's reach!

290
00:18:06,530 --> 00:18:12,007
Fascinating. If I had not elevated
you beyond crude emotions,

291
00:18:12,107 --> 00:18:15,720
<i>I could almost mistake
that tone for one of victory.</i>

292
00:18:16,398 --> 00:18:18,288
Beware your pride.

293
00:18:18,388 --> 00:18:20,609
The Doctor cannot stop us!

294
00:18:21,009 --> 00:18:25,251
And yet, Dalek Caan is uneasy.

295
00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:31,125
The Abomination is insane.

296
00:18:31,225 --> 00:18:32,433
Show respect.

297
00:18:32,671 --> 00:18:35,811
Without Dalek Caan,
none of this would be possible.

298
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,630
<i>And he speaks only the truth.</i>

299
00:18:38,730 --> 00:18:41,053
He is coming.

300
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:47,120
The threefold man, he dances
in the lonely places.

301
00:18:47,487 --> 00:18:50,177
<i>Oh, creator of us all.</i>

302
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:53,283
The Doctor is coming...

303
00:19:19,810 --> 00:19:20,880
<i>You need sustenance.</i>

304
00:19:21,850 --> 00:19:23,491
Take the water. It purifies.

305
00:19:24,418 --> 00:19:25,074
Thanks.

306
00:19:26,031 --> 00:19:27,608
There was something on your back.

307
00:19:29,772 --> 00:19:30,667
How d'you know that?

308
00:19:31,487 --> 00:19:33,009
You are something new.

309
00:19:33,942 --> 00:19:34,750
Not me.

310
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:37,121
<i>I'm just a temp.</i>

311
00:19:37,759 --> 00:19:40,149
Shorthand, filing,
100 words per minute,

312
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,678
fat lot of good that is now.

313
00:19:43,491 --> 00:19:44,543
I'm no use to anyone.

314
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:46,745
I'm so sorry for your loss.

315
00:19:48,330 --> 00:19:49,005
Yeah.

316
00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:52,520
My whole planet's gone.

317
00:19:53,191 --> 00:19:55,331
I mean the loss that is yet to come.

318
00:19:58,246 --> 00:19:59,185
God save you.

319
00:20:02,451 --> 00:20:04,791
Come on, think, Earth!
Must've been some sort of warning.

320
00:20:04,891 --> 00:20:06,850
Was there anything happening, like,

321
00:20:06,950 --> 00:20:10,015
electrical storms, freak weather,
patterns in the sky?

322
00:20:10,115 --> 00:20:11,404
Well, how should I know?

323
00:20:12,155 --> 00:20:13,503
Um... no,

324
00:20:14,304 --> 00:20:15,343
I don't think so, no.

325
00:20:16,225 --> 00:20:18,320
- OK, never mind.
- Although...

326
00:20:20,448 --> 00:20:21,781
there were the bees disappearing.

327
00:20:22,594 --> 00:20:23,760
The bees disappearing...

328
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:26,575
<i>The bees disappearing.</i>

329
00:20:27,583 --> 00:20:30,930
The bees disappearing.
How is that significant?

330
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:32,707
On Earth we have these insects.

331
00:20:32,807 --> 00:20:35,100
Some people said it was pollution,
or mobile phone...

332
00:20:35,269 --> 00:20:36,426
Or, they were going home!

333
00:20:36,839 --> 00:20:39,336
- Back home where?
- The planet Melissa Majoria!

334
00:20:39,755 --> 00:20:43,553
- Are you saying bees are aliens?!
- Don't be so daft. Not all of them.

335
00:20:43,653 --> 00:20:46,216
But if the migrant bees felt something
coming, and escaped...

336
00:20:46,316 --> 00:20:47,242
Tandocca!

337
00:20:47,342 --> 00:20:48,687
The Tandocca Scale!

338
00:20:48,787 --> 00:20:52,053
It's wavelengths used as
a carrier signal. Infinitely small!

339
00:20:52,153 --> 00:20:55,140
It's like looking for a speck
of cinnamon in the Sahara, but look,

340
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:57,297
There it is. The Tandocca trail.

341
00:20:58,255 --> 00:21:01,471
The transmat that moved the planets used
the same wavelength, we can follow it!

342
00:21:01,571 --> 00:21:03,401
Find the Earth?!
Stop talking and do it!

343
00:21:03,501 --> 00:21:04,315
I am!

344
00:21:07,587 --> 00:21:08,544
We're a bit late.

345
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:12,686
The signal's scattered.
But it's a start!

346
00:21:15,353 --> 00:21:17,505
I've got a blip! Just a blip!
But definitely a blip!

347
00:21:17,605 --> 00:21:19,895
According to the Strictures
of the Shadow Proclamation,

348
00:21:19,995 --> 00:21:22,811
I will have to seize your
transport and your technology.

349
00:21:22,911 --> 00:21:24,240
Oh, really, what for?

350
00:21:24,522 --> 00:21:26,918
The planets were stolen
with hostile intent.

351
00:21:27,018 --> 00:21:29,915
We are declaring war, Doctor.
Right across the universe.

352
00:21:30,015 --> 00:21:32,655
And you will lead us into battle!

353
00:21:33,512 --> 00:21:35,393
Right, yes,

354
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:38,171
course I will.

355
00:21:39,078 --> 00:21:40,643
I'll just go and...

356
00:21:42,106 --> 00:21:43,133
get you the key.

357
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:52,403
Doctor! Come back!

358
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:57,480
By the Holy Writ
of the Shadow Proclamation,

359
00:21:57,580 --> 00:22:00,257
I order you to stop!

360
00:22:00,357 --> 00:22:03,600
All Humans will leave their homes!

361
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:07,173
The males, the females,

362
00:22:07,273 --> 00:22:10,760
the descendants, you will come with us!

363
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:13,000
Resistance is useless!

364
00:22:13,317 --> 00:22:17,873
- Where are you taking us?
- Daleks do not answer Human questions!

365
00:22:17,973 --> 00:22:21,523
- Stand in line!
- Dad, please come home.

366
00:22:21,623 --> 00:22:24,234
- They're leaving our street alone.
- Yeah, I've got a weapon!

367
00:22:24,334 --> 00:22:26,486
- It's a paint gun!
- Exactly!

368
00:22:27,018 --> 00:22:29,783
Them Dalek things,
they've only got one eye...

369
00:22:30,121 --> 00:22:32,472
Good splodge of paint,
they'd be blinded!

370
00:22:32,572 --> 00:22:34,934
We're not going! D'you hear me?

371
00:22:35,597 --> 00:22:37,793
Laura, get back inside the house!

372
00:22:37,956 --> 00:22:39,639
Simon! Get inside! Go!

373
00:22:42,953 --> 00:22:44,417
Get back in the sky,

374
00:22:45,174 --> 00:22:47,721
<i>get back where you came from,
and leave us alone!</i>

375
00:22:49,347 --> 00:22:52,124
Dalek attack formation seven.

376
00:22:56,011 --> 00:22:58,807
Maximum extermination!

377
00:23:05,773 --> 00:23:07,894
- They're monsters.
- Please, Dad.

378
00:23:07,994 --> 00:23:09,228
Come home.

379
00:23:13,001 --> 00:23:17,120
- Halt! You will come with me!
- Will I heck!

380
00:23:21,559 --> 00:23:24,412
My vision is NOT impaired!

381
00:23:24,512 --> 00:23:28,323
- I warned you, Dad!
- Hostility will not be tolerated!

382
00:23:28,423 --> 00:23:31,154
Exterminate! Exterminate! Exter...

383
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:44,130
- Do you want to swap?
- You're Donna Noble's family, right?

384
00:23:44,530 --> 00:23:46,595
I'm Rose Tyler. And I need you.

385
00:23:48,697 --> 00:23:50,899
I've tried calling her,
but I can't get through!

386
00:23:50,999 --> 00:23:53,521
But she's still with the Doctor,
I know that much...

387
00:23:53,724 --> 00:23:55,720
and the last time she phoned,

388
00:23:55,889 --> 00:23:58,680
it was from a planet called Midnight,
made of diamonds!

389
00:23:58,780 --> 00:24:00,627
What the hell are you two on about?

390
00:24:00,727 --> 00:24:02,479
Look, she's out there, sweetheart.

391
00:24:02,798 --> 00:24:04,080
Your daughter.

392
00:24:04,537 --> 00:24:08,160
She's travelling the stars,
with that Doctor, she always has been!

393
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:10,822
- Don't be ridiculous.
- Oh, come on open your eyes!

394
00:24:10,922 --> 00:24:13,381
Look at the sky! Look at the Daleks!

395
00:24:13,481 --> 00:24:16,078
You can't start denying things now!

396
00:24:16,278 --> 00:24:19,064
You were my last hope.
If we can't find Donna,

397
00:24:19,815 --> 00:24:21,185
<i>then we can't find the Doctor...</i>

398
00:24:24,545 --> 00:24:25,880
Where is he?!

399
00:24:36,330 --> 00:24:37,076
It's stopped.

400
00:24:37,876 --> 00:24:38,740
What d'you mean?

401
00:24:40,223 --> 00:24:41,311
Is that good or bad?

402
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,044
Where are we?

403
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:45,260
The Medusa Cascade.

404
00:24:55,682 --> 00:24:57,315
I came here when I was just a kid.

405
00:24:58,185 --> 00:24:59,392
90 years old.

406
00:25:00,781 --> 00:25:03,472
<i>It was the centre of
a rift in time and space...</i>

407
00:25:04,410 --> 00:25:05,073
<i>So...</i>

408
00:25:06,239 --> 00:25:07,800
where are the 27 planets?

409
00:25:08,253 --> 00:25:09,085
Nowhere.

410
00:25:10,424 --> 00:25:12,076
The Tandocca Trail stops dead.

411
00:25:15,874 --> 00:25:16,965
End of the line.

412
00:25:18,517 --> 00:25:19,743
So what do we do?

413
00:25:22,008 --> 00:25:23,766
Doctor? What do we do?

414
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:27,699
<i>Now don't do this to me.</i>

415
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:31,716
No, don't,

416
00:25:32,711 --> 00:25:33,720
don't do this to me.

417
00:25:35,182 --> 00:25:36,039
<i>Not now.</i>

418
00:25:37,159 --> 00:25:39,357
Tell me, what are we going do?

419
00:25:42,372 --> 00:25:43,561
You never give up.

420
00:25:45,751 --> 00:25:46,595
Please.

421
00:25:53,726 --> 00:25:56,679
<i>This is the Commander General
of the United Nations</i>

422
00:25:56,942 --> 00:25:58,644
<i>calling the Dalek Fleet.</i>

423
00:25:59,294 --> 00:26:02,584
<i>We surrender, repeat, we surrender.</i>

424
00:26:03,268 --> 00:26:05,200
<i>Planet Earth surrenders.</i>

425
00:26:05,521 --> 00:26:10,760
<i>Humans selected for testing
will follow Dalek instruction...</i>

426
00:26:11,603 --> 00:26:14,055
<i>The Daleks reign supreme.</i>

427
00:26:14,243 --> 00:26:16,539
<i>All hail the Daleks.</i>

428
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:21,460
<i>You will obey Dalek
instructions without question.</i>

429
00:26:22,129 --> 00:26:24,558
<i>You will obey your Dalek Ma...</i>

430
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:32,412
<i>Can anyone hear me?</i>

431
00:26:33,648 --> 00:26:35,575
<i>The Subwave Network is open.</i>

432
00:26:35,675 --> 00:26:37,502
<i>You should be able to hear my voice.</i>

433
00:26:39,423 --> 00:26:41,000
<i>Is there anyone there?</i>

434
00:26:41,377 --> 00:26:42,920
I know that voice.

435
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:46,363
- Who's that?
- Some poor soul calling for help.

436
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:48,680
- Can anyone...
- There's nothing we can do.

437
00:26:49,009 --> 00:26:49,985
But look at Mr Smith.

438
00:26:50,085 --> 00:26:52,694
<i>Processing incoming soundwave.</i>

439
00:26:52,926 --> 00:26:55,460
<i>This message is of
the utmost importance.</i>

440
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:56,720
<i>We haven't much time...</i>

441
00:26:58,404 --> 00:26:59,487
<i>Can anyone hear me?</i>

442
00:27:01,063 --> 00:27:02,496
Someone's trying to get in touch.

443
00:27:03,866 --> 00:27:06,080
The whole world's crying out.
Just leave it.

444
00:27:06,488 --> 00:27:09,160
<i>Captain Jack Harkness,
shame on you!</i>

445
00:27:09,649 --> 00:27:11,680
<i>Now stand to attention, sir!</i>

446
00:27:12,592 --> 00:27:13,330
What?!

447
00:27:14,369 --> 00:27:15,343
Who is that?

448
00:27:17,588 --> 00:27:20,204
Harriet Jones,
former Prime Minister.

449
00:27:20,523 --> 00:27:22,243
Yeah, I know who you are.

450
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:26,180
Harriet! It's me, it's me.
Oh, she can't hear me...

451
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:27,239
Have you got a webcam?

452
00:27:27,339 --> 00:27:29,400
She wouldn't let me,
said they're naughty.

453
00:27:30,835 --> 00:27:33,370
- I can't speak to her then, can I?
- Sarah Jane Smith,

454
00:27:33,669 --> 00:27:38,600
- 13 Bannerman Road... are you there?
- Yeah. I'm here! That's me!

455
00:27:38,860 --> 00:27:42,080
Good... Now, let's see
if we can talk to each other.

456
00:27:46,363 --> 00:27:49,045
The fourth contact is having
some trouble getting through.

457
00:27:49,145 --> 00:27:51,076
That's me! Harriet! That's me!

458
00:27:51,357 --> 00:27:52,996
I'll just boost the signal...

459
00:27:54,041 --> 00:27:54,840
Hello?

460
00:27:56,087 --> 00:27:57,248
Martha Jones!

461
00:27:57,517 --> 00:27:59,194
Who's she? I want to get through!

462
00:27:59,294 --> 00:28:00,233
Martha, where are you?!

463
00:28:00,333 --> 00:28:02,673
I guess Project Indigo
was more clever than we thought.

464
00:28:02,773 --> 00:28:04,575
One second I was in Manhattan...

465
00:28:05,976 --> 00:28:08,882
<i>Next second...
Maybe Indigo tapped into my mind.</i>

466
00:28:08,982 --> 00:28:11,604
<i>Cos I ended up in the
one place that I wanted to be.</i>

467
00:28:14,694 --> 00:28:15,226
Mum!

468
00:28:19,170 --> 00:28:20,195
<i>You came home..</i>

469
00:28:20,658 --> 00:28:22,920
At the end of the world,
you came back to me.

470
00:28:24,750 --> 00:28:28,100
But then all of a sudden,
it's like the laptop turned itself on.

471
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:30,464
It did. That was me.

472
00:28:31,577 --> 00:28:33,423
Harriet Jones,
former Prime Minister.

473
00:28:33,523 --> 00:28:35,466
Yes, I know who you are.

474
00:28:35,566 --> 00:28:38,841
<i>I thought it was about time we all met.
Given the current crisis.</i>

475
00:28:38,941 --> 00:28:41,507
<i>Torchwood, this is Sarah Jane Smith.</i>

476
00:28:41,751 --> 00:28:43,258
I've been following your work.

477
00:28:43,609 --> 00:28:45,115
Nice job with the Slitheen.

478
00:28:45,459 --> 00:28:47,611
Yeah, well I've been
staying away from you lot.

479
00:28:47,818 --> 00:28:49,019
Too many guns!

480
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:50,671
All the same,

481
00:28:51,309 --> 00:28:53,004
might I say, looking good, ma'am.

482
00:28:53,517 --> 00:28:54,864
Really? Oh.

483
00:28:55,215 --> 00:28:56,547
Not now, Captain.

484
00:28:57,129 --> 00:29:00,308
And Martha Jones,
former companion to the Doctor.

485
00:29:00,708 --> 00:29:01,815
Oi! So was I!!

486
00:29:01,915 --> 00:29:03,548
But how did you find me?

487
00:29:04,049 --> 00:29:07,221
<i>This, ladies and gentlemen,
this is the Subwave Network.</i>

488
00:29:07,477 --> 00:29:11,300
A sentient piece of software, programmed
to seek out anyone at everyone

489
00:29:11,519 --> 00:29:13,265
who can help to contact the Doctor.

490
00:29:13,365 --> 00:29:14,929
What if the Daleks can hear us?

491
00:29:15,029 --> 00:29:19,280
No, that's the beauty of the Subwave,
it's undetectable.

492
00:29:19,479 --> 00:29:21,262
And you invented it?

493
00:29:21,362 --> 00:29:25,016
I developed it. It was created
by the Mr Copper Foundation.

494
00:29:25,116 --> 00:29:27,255
<i>Yeah, but what we need, is a weapon!</i>

495
00:29:27,649 --> 00:29:29,839
Martha, back there at UNIT,
what did they give you,

496
00:29:29,939 --> 00:29:31,178
<i>what was that key thing?</i>

497
00:29:32,423 --> 00:29:33,600
The Osterhagen Key.

498
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:38,012
That key is not to be used, Dr Jones.
Not under any circumstances.

499
00:29:38,879 --> 00:29:40,600
But what is an Osterhagen Key?

500
00:29:40,781 --> 00:29:42,902
Forget about the key
and that's an order.

501
00:29:43,622 --> 00:29:45,353
<i>All we need is the Doctor.</i>

502
00:29:45,678 --> 00:29:49,013
Excuse me, Harriet, but,
if you're looking for the Doctor...

503
00:29:49,113 --> 00:29:51,384
- didn't he depose you?
- He did.

504
00:29:51,852 --> 00:29:54,711
And I've wondering about that for
a long time. Whether I was wrong,

505
00:29:55,262 --> 00:29:57,347
but I stand by my actions, to this day.

506
00:29:57,447 --> 00:29:59,493
Because I knew, I knew that one day,

507
00:29:59,891 --> 00:30:03,560
<i>the Earth would be in danger,
and the Doctor would fail to appear.</i>

508
00:30:04,389 --> 00:30:05,730
I told him so myself.

509
00:30:05,830 --> 00:30:06,920
And he didn't listen.

510
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:08,383
But I've been trying to find him,

511
00:30:08,483 --> 00:30:10,986
he got my phone, on the TARDIS,
but I can't get through.

512
00:30:11,086 --> 00:30:12,892
Nor me, and I was here first!

513
00:30:12,992 --> 00:30:14,641
That's why we need the Subwave.

514
00:30:15,102 --> 00:30:16,353
To bring us all together,

515
00:30:16,453 --> 00:30:19,725
combine forces.
The Doctor's secret army.

516
00:30:20,783 --> 00:30:21,646
Wait a minute...

517
00:30:22,084 --> 00:30:23,604
we boost the signal! That's it!

518
00:30:24,161 --> 00:30:26,657
We transmit that telephone number
through Torchwood,

519
00:30:26,757 --> 00:30:28,320
using all the power of the Rift...

520
00:30:28,420 --> 00:30:29,800
And we've got Mr Smith!

521
00:30:30,173 --> 00:30:32,580
<i>He can link up with every
telephone exchange on the Earth!</i>

522
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:35,213
<i>Can get the whole world to
call same number, at the same time!</i>

523
00:30:35,313 --> 00:30:37,172
Billions of phones,
calling out, all at once!

524
00:30:37,704 --> 00:30:39,712
Brilliant! Who's the kid?

525
00:30:40,375 --> 00:30:41,320
That's my son!

526
00:30:42,177 --> 00:30:43,334
But, excuse me, sorry,

527
00:30:43,728 --> 00:30:45,688
sorry, hello, Ianto Jones.

528
00:30:46,066 --> 00:30:47,412
If we start transmitting,

529
00:30:47,512 --> 00:30:50,411
then this Subwave Network
is going to become visible.

530
00:30:50,511 --> 00:30:51,969
I mean, to the Daleks.

531
00:30:52,069 --> 00:30:55,721
Yes, and they'll trace it back to me.
But my life doesn't matter.

532
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:57,236
Not if it saves the Earth.

533
00:30:58,706 --> 00:31:00,600
- Ma'am.
- Thank you, Captain.

534
00:31:01,592 --> 00:31:04,251
But there are people out there dying,
on the streets.

535
00:31:04,689 --> 00:31:06,603
Marvellous woman. I voted for her.

536
00:31:06,866 --> 00:31:07,920
You did not.

537
00:31:08,242 --> 00:31:10,802
Now enough of words. Let's begin!

538
00:31:15,126 --> 00:31:16,422
Rift Power activated!

539
00:31:17,635 --> 00:31:19,156
All terminals coordinated!

540
00:31:28,475 --> 00:31:30,883
National grid online...
giving you everything we've got!

541
00:31:31,866 --> 00:31:33,155
Connecting you to Mr Smith!

542
00:31:33,255 --> 00:31:34,880
All telephone networks combined!

543
00:31:36,912 --> 00:31:38,840
Sending you the number... now!

544
00:31:39,571 --> 00:31:45,520
Opening Subwave Network to maximum.

545
00:31:45,705 --> 00:31:46,994
Mr Smith...

546
00:31:48,227 --> 00:31:51,440
- make that call!
- Calling the Doctor!

547
00:31:52,368 --> 00:31:53,600
So am I!

548
00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:58,221
A-a-a-and sending!

549
00:32:20,569 --> 00:32:22,013
- Phone!
- Phone!

550
00:32:23,334 --> 00:32:24,766
Martha, is that you?!

551
00:32:25,559 --> 00:32:26,329
It's the signal!

552
00:32:26,429 --> 00:32:29,194
- Can we follow it?
- Just watch me!

553
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:35,795
Emergency! Unknown network detected!
Subwave frequency!

554
00:32:35,895 --> 00:32:40,317
Find the point of origin.
Find and exterminate!

555
00:32:40,417 --> 00:32:42,764
<i>I warned you, Supreme One...</i>

556
00:32:43,177 --> 00:32:45,800
Just as Dalek Caan foretold.

557
00:32:46,148 --> 00:32:49,405
The Children of Time
are moving against us.

558
00:32:49,684 --> 00:32:53,338
But everything is falling into place.

559
00:32:59,488 --> 00:33:01,310
I think we've got a fix!

560
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:03,248
Mr Smith, now at 200%.

561
00:33:07,889 --> 00:33:09,840
Oh, come on, Doctor!

562
00:33:20,412 --> 00:33:21,801
Find me, Doctor.

563
00:33:23,323 --> 00:33:24,462
Find me.

564
00:33:25,561 --> 00:33:27,601
Got it! Locking on!

565
00:33:33,979 --> 00:33:36,356
Harriet! A saucer's locked on
to your location,

566
00:33:36,738 --> 00:33:37,995
they've found you...

567
00:33:38,180 --> 00:33:41,549
I know. I'm using the Network
to mask your transmission. Keep going!

568
00:33:41,649 --> 00:33:43,400
<i>Exterminate!</i>

569
00:33:49,624 --> 00:33:51,319
We're travelling through time.

570
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:56,787
One second in the future!
The phone call's pulling us through!

571
00:33:59,464 --> 00:34:00,520
Captain,

572
00:34:01,178 --> 00:34:05,800
<i>I'm transferring the Subwave Network
to Torchwood, you're in charge now.</i>

573
00:34:06,496 --> 00:34:07,985
And tell the Doctor from me...

574
00:34:08,805 --> 00:34:10,548
<i>he chose his companions well.</i>

575
00:34:12,218 --> 00:34:13,257
It's been an honour.

576
00:34:22,562 --> 00:34:24,689
Harriet Jones.
Former Prime Minister.

577
00:34:24,789 --> 00:34:27,867
Yes, we know who you are.

578
00:34:29,019 --> 00:34:31,002
Oh, you know nothing of any Human.

579
00:34:31,570 --> 00:34:33,079
And that will be your downfall.

580
00:34:35,144 --> 00:34:37,009
<i>Exterminate!</i>

581
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:50,053
Three! Two! One!

582
00:35:06,344 --> 00:35:07,721
27 planets.

583
00:35:09,304 --> 00:35:10,280
And there's the Earth!

584
00:35:11,863 --> 00:35:13,240
<i>Why couldn't we see them?!</i>

585
00:35:13,874 --> 00:35:15,481
The entire Medusa Cascade

586
00:35:15,581 --> 00:35:18,397
has been put a second out of sync
with the rest of the universe.

587
00:35:18,497 --> 00:35:21,607
Perfect hiding place, tiny little pocket
of time. But we found them!

588
00:35:22,314 --> 00:35:24,877
Ooh, ooh, what's that?

589
00:35:25,759 --> 00:35:27,160
Hold on, hold on,

590
00:35:27,755 --> 00:35:29,600
some sort of Subwave Network...

591
00:35:32,353 --> 00:35:35,231
Where the hell have you been?!
Doctor, it's the Daleks!

592
00:35:35,331 --> 00:35:37,990
- He's nice I thought he'd be older.
- He's not that young.

593
00:35:38,090 --> 00:35:40,318
<i>The Daleks are taking people
to their spaceship...</i>

594
00:35:40,731 --> 00:35:42,441
Look, Doctor, I've got a son!

595
00:35:42,541 --> 00:35:44,011
It's not just Dalek Caan!

596
00:35:44,111 --> 00:35:46,220
- That's Donna!
- That's my girl!

597
00:35:46,639 --> 00:35:48,600
Sarah Jane! Who's that boy?

598
00:35:49,223 --> 00:35:50,600
That must be Torchwood.

599
00:35:51,145 --> 00:35:52,280
Aren't they brilliant?

600
00:35:52,540 --> 00:35:54,546
<i>Look at you all, you clever people.</i>

601
00:35:54,847 --> 00:35:58,832
That's Martha. And who's... he?

602
00:35:59,269 --> 00:36:03,160
Captain Jack. Don't. Just... don't.

603
00:36:03,924 --> 00:36:05,219
Doctor, it's me,

604
00:36:06,276 --> 00:36:07,365
I came back.

605
00:36:08,453 --> 00:36:11,016
<i>It's like an outer space Facebook.</i>

606
00:36:11,375 --> 00:36:12,697
Everyone except Rose.

607
00:36:20,717 --> 00:36:22,384
He is here.

608
00:36:22,985 --> 00:36:25,704
The Dark Lord is come.

609
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:28,487
Supreme One, this Subwave Network,

610
00:36:28,587 --> 00:36:30,639
I would address it, give me access.

611
00:36:33,708 --> 00:36:34,493
We've lost them!

612
00:36:34,593 --> 00:36:36,400
No, no, no, there's another signal.

613
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:39,253
There's someone else out there.
Hello? Can you hear me?

614
00:36:39,683 --> 00:36:40,380
Rose?

615
00:36:41,970 --> 00:36:44,244
<i>Your voice is different. And yet,</i>

616
00:36:45,285 --> 00:36:48,480
its arrogance is unchanged.

617
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:49,426
No.

618
00:36:51,207 --> 00:36:52,309
But he's dead...

619
00:36:54,046 --> 00:36:57,664
Welcome to my new Empire, Doctor.

620
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:02,352
It is only fitting that you should bear
witness to the resurrection,

621
00:37:02,452 --> 00:37:05,253
and the triumph, of Davros.

622
00:37:05,353 --> 00:37:09,778
Lord and Creator of the Dalek Race!

623
00:37:12,382 --> 00:37:15,082
- Doctor?
- Have you nothing to say?

624
00:37:16,823 --> 00:37:18,104
Doctor, it's all right.

625
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:21,862
We're in the TARDIS. We're safe.

626
00:37:23,110 --> 00:37:24,217
But you were destroyed.

627
00:37:25,525 --> 00:37:28,166
In the very first year of the Time War.
At the Gates of Elysium.

628
00:37:28,266 --> 00:37:31,250
<i>I saw your command ship fly into
the jaws of the Nightmare Child.</i>

629
00:37:31,782 --> 00:37:33,108
I tried to save you.

630
00:37:33,208 --> 00:37:35,417
But it took one stronger than you.

631
00:37:35,942 --> 00:37:38,000
Dalek Caan himself.

632
00:37:38,367 --> 00:37:41,858
I flew into the wild and fire,

633
00:37:41,980 --> 00:37:46,376
I danced and died a thousand times.

634
00:37:46,570 --> 00:37:50,968
Emergency Temporal Shift took
him back into the Time War itself.

635
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:53,383
That's impossible!
The entire war is timelocked!

636
00:37:53,483 --> 00:37:55,492
And yet he succeeded.

637
00:37:55,592 --> 00:37:58,672
Oh, it cost him his mind.
But imagine,

638
00:37:58,958 --> 00:38:02,956
a single, simple Dalek succeeded where

639
00:38:03,581 --> 00:38:06,440
Emperors and Time Lords have failed.

640
00:38:07,067 --> 00:38:11,760
A testament, don't you think,
to my remarkable creations?

641
00:38:12,260 --> 00:38:14,337
And you made a new race of Daleks?

642
00:38:15,676 --> 00:38:17,436
I gave myself to them.

643
00:38:18,024 --> 00:38:19,445
Quite literally.

644
00:38:20,108 --> 00:38:24,662
Each one grown from a cell
of my own body.

645
00:38:27,649 --> 00:38:29,181
New Daleks.

646
00:38:29,456 --> 00:38:31,680
<i>True Daleks.</i>

647
00:38:32,253 --> 00:38:34,249
I have my children, Doctor.

648
00:38:35,481 --> 00:38:37,743
What do you have, now?

649
00:38:38,513 --> 00:38:39,714
After all this time.

650
00:38:40,302 --> 00:38:42,774
Everything we saw.
Everything we lost.

651
00:38:43,987 --> 00:38:46,600
I have only one thing to say to you...

652
00:38:47,063 --> 00:38:47,895
Bye!

653
00:38:52,049 --> 00:38:52,969
Emergency!

654
00:38:53,069 --> 00:38:56,729
Locate the TARDIS! Find the Doctor!

655
00:38:56,910 --> 00:39:00,839
He will go to the Earth,
to find his precious Human allies!

656
00:39:01,110 --> 00:39:03,074
And death is coming.

657
00:39:03,324 --> 00:39:06,027
Oh, I can see it.

658
00:39:06,127 --> 00:39:11,794
Everlasting death for
the most faithful companion...

659
00:39:11,894 --> 00:39:16,017
Subwave Network rerouted.
New location : Torchwood!

660
00:39:16,117 --> 00:39:21,719
Then exterminate them, at once!
Exterminate Torchwood!

661
00:39:24,359 --> 00:39:25,273
Gwen,

662
00:39:26,336 --> 00:39:28,467
Dalek saucer heading for the Bay.
They've found us.

663
00:39:29,643 --> 00:39:31,240
<i>Martha, open that Indigo device...</i>

664
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:34,892
Lift the central panel, there's
a string of numbers that change...

665
00:39:34,992 --> 00:39:38,655
<i>The fourth number oscillates between
two digits, tell me what they are.</i>

666
00:39:39,085 --> 00:39:41,882
It's a four, and a nine,
we could never work out what that was.

667
00:39:42,652 --> 00:39:44,122
That's the teleport base code.

668
00:39:44,447 --> 00:39:46,887
And that's all I need,
to get this thing working again!

669
00:39:48,032 --> 00:39:50,529
Oscillating four and nine...

670
00:39:51,436 --> 00:39:52,800
Thank you, Martha Jones!

671
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:56,026
I've gotta go,

672
00:39:56,620 --> 00:39:57,865
I've gotta find the Doctor,

673
00:39:59,548 --> 00:40:00,587
I'll come back,

674
00:40:02,457 --> 00:40:03,446
I'm coming back.

675
00:40:03,608 --> 00:40:05,279
Don't worry about us! Just go!

676
00:40:05,955 --> 00:40:07,515
- We'll be fine!
- You'd better be.

677
00:40:24,345 --> 00:40:28,310
<i>Exterminate! Exterminate!</i>

678
00:40:28,410 --> 00:40:29,477
They're here...

679
00:40:29,577 --> 00:40:31,548
TARDIS heading for Vector 7,

680
00:40:31,710 --> 00:40:34,149
- grid reference 665.
- But there are Daleks out there!

681
00:40:34,249 --> 00:40:38,542
I know, I'm sorry,
but I have got to find the Doctor...

682
00:40:39,314 --> 00:40:42,724
Don't move, don't leave the house,
don't do anything.

683
00:40:42,824 --> 00:40:45,088
<i>I will protect the boy,
Sarah Jane.</i>

684
00:40:46,217 --> 00:40:47,205
I love you.

685
00:40:47,856 --> 00:40:48,757
Remember that.

686
00:41:02,998 --> 00:41:04,513
Control? I need another shift.

687
00:41:04,613 --> 00:41:06,428
Lock me on to the TARDIS... now!

688
00:41:08,123 --> 00:41:10,288
Right, I'm gonna find them.

689
00:41:11,327 --> 00:41:12,240
Wish me luck!

690
00:41:12,555 --> 00:41:14,569
- Oh, good luck.
- Yeah, good luck, sweetheart!

691
00:41:27,187 --> 00:41:28,351
It's like a ghost town.

692
00:41:28,977 --> 00:41:32,161
<i>Sarah Jane said they were
taking the people. What for?</i>

693
00:41:32,261 --> 00:41:35,440
Think, Donna, when you met Rose in
that parallel world, what did she say?

694
00:41:36,004 --> 00:41:38,480
Just... the darkness is coming.

695
00:41:38,901 --> 00:41:39,883
Anything else?

696
00:41:44,170 --> 00:41:45,520
Why don't you ask her yourself?

697
00:42:32,229 --> 00:42:34,168
Exterminate!

698
00:42:46,612 --> 00:42:48,471
I've got you, it missed you.

699
00:42:48,571 --> 00:42:49,841
Look, it's me.

700
00:42:50,706 --> 00:42:52,408
- Rose...
- Hi.

701
00:42:53,707 --> 00:42:55,465
- Long time no see...
- Yeah,

702
00:42:56,698 --> 00:42:58,009
been busy, y'know.

703
00:42:59,020 --> 00:43:01,310
Don't die, oh, my God, don't die.

704
00:43:02,630 --> 00:43:04,019
My god, don't die.

705
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:08,400
Get him into the TARDIS,
quick. Move!

706
00:43:12,021 --> 00:43:15,074
- But they don't work against Daleks!
- Well, I'm going out fighting.

707
00:43:15,249 --> 00:43:17,127
Like Owen... Like Tosh.

708
00:43:18,691 --> 00:43:19,720
How about you?

709
00:43:22,896 --> 00:43:24,047
Yes, ma'am!

710
00:43:27,031 --> 00:43:28,645
<i>What. What do we do?!</i>

711
00:43:29,602 --> 00:43:31,492
There must be some medicine,
or something.

712
00:43:31,761 --> 00:43:33,675
Just step back. Rose!

713
00:43:34,032 --> 00:43:35,471
Do as I say, and get back!

714
00:43:35,715 --> 00:43:37,908
<i>He's dying and you know
what happens next.</i>

715
00:43:38,715 --> 00:43:39,672
What d'you mean?

716
00:43:41,205 --> 00:43:43,182
Oh, no, I came all this way.

717
00:43:43,401 --> 00:43:45,078
What d'you mean? What happens next?

718
00:43:51,348 --> 00:43:52,400
It's starting...

719
00:44:09,050 --> 00:44:11,735
All Human transport is forbidden!

720
00:44:11,835 --> 00:44:16,077
- I surrender! I'm sorry!
- Daleks do not accept apologies!

721
00:44:16,177 --> 00:44:17,969
You will be exterminated!

722
00:44:18,144 --> 00:44:20,846
<i>Exterminate! Exterminate!</i>

723
00:44:27,316 --> 00:44:31,220
Exterminate. Exterminate.

724
00:44:35,769 --> 00:44:36,487
Here we go.

725
00:44:37,888 --> 00:44:38,996
Good luck, Doctor!

726
00:44:39,096 --> 00:44:43,179
- Will someone tell me what is going on!
- When he's dying, his body...

727
00:44:43,279 --> 00:44:45,058
it repairs itself. It changes.

728
00:44:45,603 --> 00:44:48,956
- But you can't!
- I'm sorry, it's too late.

729
00:44:51,719 --> 00:44:53,250
I'm regenerating.

730
00:45:36,512 --> 00:45:41,108
