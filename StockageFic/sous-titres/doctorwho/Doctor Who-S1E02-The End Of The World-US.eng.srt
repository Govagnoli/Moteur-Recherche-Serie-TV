1
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:02,900
CREAK

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Run.

3
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:09,900
- I'm The Doctor, by the way. What's your name?
- Rose.
- Nice to meet you.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,200
Run for your life.

5
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:22,300
It'll follow us!
The hordes of Genghis Khan couldn't get through
that door. Believe me, they tried.

6
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:24,600
Are you alien? Yes.

7
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:31,700
You could come with me.
Is it always this dangerous? Yeah.

8
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:40,100
Right, Rose Tyler, you tell me -

9
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:44,000
where do you wanna go? Backwards
or forwards in time? Your choice.

10
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:46,300
What's it gonna be?

11
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:47,600
Forwards.

12
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:54,900
How far? ...One hundred years.

13
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:01,700
TARDIS REVS AND GROANS

14
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:08,900
Step outside those doors - it's
the 22nd century. You're kidding.

15
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,300
That's a bit boring, though.
D'you wanna go further? Fine by me.

16
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:22,200
Ten thousand years in the future.

17
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:26,500
Step outside - it's the year 12005.
The new Roman Empire.

18
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:30,600
You think you're so impressive.
I am so impressive. You wish!

19
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:34,500
Right, then. You asked for it.
I know exactly where to go.

20
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:38,800
Hold on!

21
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:41,800
TARDIS GROANS AND ROARS

22
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:51,600
PING!

23
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,700
Where are we?

24
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,800
FAINT CREAKS

25
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:00,200
What's out there?

26
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:32,600
You lot... you spend all your time
thinking about dying.

27
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:38,500
Like you're gonna get killed
by eggs or beef
or global warming or asteroids.

28
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:43,500
But you never take time to imagine
the impossible,
that maybe you survive.

29
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:49,200
This is the year 5.5/Apple/26.

30
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:51,600
Five billion years in your future.

31
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:53,800
And this is the day...

32
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:55,800
Hold on...

33
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:04,500
This is the day the sun expands.

34
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:08,600
Welcome to the end of the world.

35
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:00,300
Shuttles five and six now docking.

36
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,300
Guests are reminded

37
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:06,800
that Platform One forbids the use of
weapons, teleportation and religion.

38
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:11,600
Earth-death is scheduled for 15:39,

39
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:15,200
followed by drinks in the Manchester Suite.

40
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,800
So when it says "guests",
does that mean people?

41
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:21,100
Depends what you mean by people.
I mean people. What do you mean?

42
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:25,800
Aliens. What are they doing on board
this space-ship? What's it all for?

43
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:28,900
It's not really a spaceship,
more like an observation deck.

44
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,000
The great and the good are gathering
to watch the planet burn. What for?

45
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:34,400
Fun.

46
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:40,600
Mind you, when I say "the great and
the good" what I mean is the rich.

47
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:45,200
But, hold on, they did this once on
Newsround Extra, the sun expanding,

48
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:47,100
it takes hundreds of years. Millions.

49
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:51,400
But the planet's now the property
of the National Trust.
They've been keeping it preserved.

50
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:55,300
See down there? Gravity satellites
holding back the sun.

51
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:59,300
The planet looks
the same as ever. I thought
the continents shifted and things.

52
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:06,100
They did. The Trust moved 'em back.
That's a Classic Earth. Now the
money's run out, nature takes over.

53
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,700
How long's it got?

54
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:11,000
About half an hour.
Then the planet gets roasted.

55
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:13,100
Is that why we're here?

56
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:15,100
I mean, is that what you do?

57
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:17,300
Jump in at the last
minute and save the Earth?

58
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,900
I'm not saving it. Time's up.

59
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,000
But what about the people? It's
empty. They've all gone. All left.

60
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:30,200
Just me, then.
Who the hell are you?

61
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:33,500
Oh, that's nice. Thanks(!)
But how did you get in?

62
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:38,600
This is a maximum hospitality zone,
the guests have disembarked. They're
on their way! Any second now...

63
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:44,700
No, that's me, I'm a guest. Look,
I've got an invitation. Look. Y'see?
It's fine. "The Doctor plus one".

64
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:50,600
I'm the Doctor, this is Rose Tyler,
she's my plus one. That all right?
Well, obviously.

65
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:52,700
Apologies, et cetera.

66
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:56,000
If you're on board,
we'd better start.

67
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:57,300
Enjoy.

68
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:02,800
The paper's slightly psychic. It
shows whatever I want them to see.

69
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:07,800
Saves a lot of time.
He's blue. Yeah... OK.

70
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:14,900
We have in attendance the Doctor
and Rose Tyler. Thank you.
All staff to their positions!

71
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,600
Hurry now! Thank you! Quick as
we can, come along, come along!

72
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:26,100
And now, might I introduce
the next honoured guest?
Representing the Forest of Cheam

73
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,900
we have trees,

74
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,600
namely Jabe, Lute and Coffa.

75
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:37,300
There will be an exchange of gifts
representing peace. If you could keep
the room circulating, thank you...

76
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:43,700
Next, from the solicitors Jolco &
Jolco, we have the Moxx of Balhoon.

77
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:46,700
And next,
from Financial Family Seven,

78
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,900
we have
the Adherents of the Repeated Meme.

79
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:55,500
The inventors of hyposlip travel
systems, the brothers Hop Pyleen!

80
00:06:55,600 --> 00:07:01,800
..Cal "Spark" Plug... Mrs and Mrs
Pacoon... The ambassadors from
the City-State of Binding Light...

81
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:07,500
A gift of peace. I bring you
a cutting of my grandfather.

82
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:11,400
Thank you, yes...
Gifts, um...

83
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:14,100
Ahem! I give you in return...

84
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,800
air from my lungs.

85
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:21,500
How... intimate.

86
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:25,500
There's more where that came from.
I bet there is.

87
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:30,700
..Our friend from
the Silver Devastation, the sponsor
of the main event, please welcome...

88
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,700
..the Face of Boe.

89
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:38,200
The Moxx of Balhoon.

90
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:41,600
My felicitations
upon this historical happenstance.

91
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:43,600
I bring the gift of bodily salivas.

92
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:46,600
HAWKS AND SPITS
Thank you very much.

93
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:53,800
Ah, the Adherents of the Repeated
Meme! I bring you air from my lungs.

94
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:59,400
A gift of peace. In all good faith.

95
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:03,500
..And last but not least,
our very special guest.

96
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:08,400
Ladies and gentlemen
and trees and multiforms,

97
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:12,400
consider the Earth, below.
In memory of this dying world,

98
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:14,200
we call forth...

99
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:17,500
the Last Human.

100
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:22,000
The Lady Cassandra O'Brien Dot Delta
Seventeen.

101
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:26,400
Oh, now don't stare! I know,
I know - it's shocking, isn't it?

102
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:33,700
I've had my chin completely taken
away, and look at the difference,
look how thin I am!

103
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:36,400
Thin and dainty!

104
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:38,700
I don't look a day over 2, 000.

105
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:41,600
(Moisturise me, moisturise me!)

106
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:50,900
Truly, I am the Last Human.
My father was a Texan, my
mother was from the Arctic Desert.

107
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:58,000
They were born on the Earth,
and they were the last to be buried
in its soil.

108
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:01,600
I have come to honour them...

109
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:04,400
HER VOICE BREAKS
..and say goodbye.

110
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:08,000
Oh, no tears, no tears...

111
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:09,600
I'm sorry.

112
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:13,600
But behold!

113
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:15,500
I bring gifts!

114
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:20,700
>From Earth itself,
the last remaining ostrich egg.

115
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:27,100
Legend says
it had a wing-span of 50 feet
and blew fire from its nostrils.

116
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,200
Or was that my THIRD husband?

117
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:34,600
Oh, no, oh, don't laugh,
I'll get laughter-lines. No, stop!

118
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:38,600
SHE GIGGLES
Mercy!

119
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:42,400
And here! Another rarity.

120
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:46,800
According to the archives,
this was called an iPod,

121
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:50,800
it stores classical music from
humanity's greatest composers.

122
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:52,400
Play on!

123
00:09:57,300 --> 00:10:00,700
INTRO TO "Tainted Love" by Soft Cell

124
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:04,800
The refreshments will now be served.

125
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:07,100
Earth-death in 30 minutes.

126
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:12,600
MARC ALMOND:
# Sometimes I feel I've got to
Run away

127
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:15,600
# I've got to
Get away... #

128
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:18,700
POLITE CHAT

129
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:27,100
#... The love we share
Seems to go nowhere

130
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,800
# And I've lost my light

131
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:33,600
# For I toss and turn
I can't sleep at night... #

132
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:35,600
Doctor.

133
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:37,200
Thank you.

134
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:42,400
A gift of peace.
In all good faith.

135
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:45,600
Er, no, you're very kind,
but I'm just the steward.

136
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:48,200
A gift of PEACE.
In all good FAITH.

137
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:51,100
Oh... yes. Thank you.

138
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,400
Of course.

139
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:54,100
Identify species.

140
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:59,200
Please identify species.
IT WHISTLES

141
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:03,200
Now stop it! Identify his race.
Where's he from?

142
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:05,800
IT WHISTLES AND TRILLS

143
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,900
It's impossible.

144
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:38,800
Sorry, am I allowed to be in 'ere?

145
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:43,300
..You have to give us
permission to talk.

146
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:45,800
Um...

147
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:49,500
Y-You have permission.

148
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,900
Thank you.

149
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,300
And, no, you're not in the way.
Guests are allowed anywhere. Oh.

150
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:00,700
BUTTONS BLEEP

151
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,400
What's your name?

152
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:04,400
Raffalo.

153
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:06,000
Raffalo?

154
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:07,700
Yes, miss.

155
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:11,800
I... I won't be long I've just got
to carry out some maintenance.

156
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:15,700
There's a tiny little glitch
in the Face of Boe's suite.

157
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:22,600
There must be something blocking
the system. He's getting no hot
water. So... you're a plumber?

158
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:24,700
That's right miss.

159
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:27,000
They still have plumbers?

160
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:29,500
I hope so, else I'm out of a job!

161
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:33,400
Where are you from? Crespallion.

162
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:37,300
That's a planet, is it?

163
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:43,900
No, Crespallion's part
of the Jaggit Brocade affiliated
to the Scarlet Junction. Convex 56.

164
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:50,000
And where are you from, miss?
If you don't mind my asking?
No, not at all...

165
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:52,200
Um, I dunno

166
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:54,700
A long way away.

167
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:59,100
I just sort of hitched a lift
with this man...

168
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:03,800
I didn't even think about it.
Don't even know who he is.

169
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:08,400
He's a complete stranger.

170
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:13,600
Anyway, um, don't let me keep you.
Good luck with it!

171
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:16,100
Thank you, miss. And, er...

172
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:20,000
thank you for the permission. Not
many people are that considerate.

173
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:22,900
OK... See you later.

174
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:32,000
Now, then.

175
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:35,000
Control, I'm at junction 19. I think
the problem's coming from in here.

176
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:37,200
I'll go inside and have a look.

177
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:41,600
IRREGULAR CLICKS
What's that?
Is there something in there?

178
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:44,600
Ooh, who are you, then?

179
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:45,600
Hold on!

180
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:52,100
If you're an upgrade,
I just need to register you,
that's all. Oh, come back.

181
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:55,600
Ah, there you are.

182
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:58,300
Now, I just need to register
your ident.

183
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:03,400
Aw, there's two of ya!
Got yourself a little mate?

184
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:05,500
MORE AND MORE CLICKS

185
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:10,100
I think I'd better report this to
control. How many of you ARE there?

186
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,900
What are you?

187
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,400
Oh, no!

188
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:17,400
NO! NO-O-O!

189
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:30,200
MUTED BLEEPS
What's that?

190
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:33,200
MORE BLEEPS
Well, how should I know?

191
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:39,000
PING!
Would the owner of the blue box
in Private Gallery 15

192
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:42,800
please report to
the steward's office immediately.

193
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:48,400
Guests are reminded that
the use of teleportation
devices is strictly forbidden

194
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:52,700
under peace treaty 5.4/cup/16.
Thank you.

195
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:57,000
'Earth-death in 25 minutes.

196
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:59,200
'Earthdeath in 25 minutes.'

197
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:00,800
Oh, thanks.

198
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,800
Hello!

199
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:10,400
My name's Rose.

200
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:13,200
That's a... sort of plant.

201
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:14,900
We might be related.

202
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,700
I'm talking to a twig.

203
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:34,800
Oi now, careful with that,
park it properly. No scratches.

204
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,600
ALIEN LANGUAGE

205
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:58,200
Rose, are you in there?

206
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,500
Aye-aye!

207
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:05,800
What d'you think, then? Great, yeah.

208
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:11,200
Fine. Once you get past
the slightly psychic paper.

209
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:14,900
They're just so alien!

210
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:19,200
The aliens are so alien.

211
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:23,700
You look at 'em...
and they're alien.

212
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:26,300
Good thing I didn't take you
to the deep South(!)

213
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:30,100
Where are you from?

214
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:32,400
All over the place.

215
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:37,900
They all speak English. No,
you just hear English. It's a gift
of the Tardis. Telepathic field,

216
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,200
gets inside your brain, translates.
It's inside MY brain?

217
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:45,300
Well, in a good way.
Your machine gets inside my head?

218
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:50,500
It gets inside and it changes
my mind, and you didn't even ask?
I didn't think about it like that.

219
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:54,800
No, you were too busy thinking up
cheap shots about the deep South!

220
00:16:54,900 --> 00:17:01,200
Who are YOU, then, Doctor? What're
you called? What sort of alien
are you? I'm just the Doctor.

221
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:06,100
>From what planet? It's not as if
you'd know it where it is(!) Where
are you from? What's it matter?

222
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:11,000
Tell me who you are! THIS is who
I am, right here, right now,
all right? All that counts

223
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:15,700
is here and now. And this is me.
Yes, and I'm here too, cos you
brought me here. So just tell me!

224
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:27,400
'Earth-death in 20 minutes,

225
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:32,200
'Earth-death in 20 minutes.'

226
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:42,300
All right.

227
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:47,700
As my mate Shireen says, don't argue
with the designated driver.

228
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:52,300
Can't exactly call for a taxi.

229
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:55,200
No signal.

230
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:58,000
We're out of range. Just a bit.

231
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:05,600
Tell you what. With a little bit
of jiggery-pokery... Is that a
technical term, jiggery-pokery(?)

232
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:08,400
Yes, I came first in jiggery-pokery.
What about you?

233
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:10,900
No, failed hullabaloo. Aw.

234
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:14,800
There you go.

235
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,800
PHONE RINGS AT OTHER END

236
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:31,400
Hello? Mum? Oh, what is it?
What's wrong, what have I done now?

237
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:35,500
Ooh, this red top's falling to bits!
You should get your money back.

238
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:40,700
Go on, there must be something.
You never phone in the middle
of the day... What's so funny?

239
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:44,600
Nothing. You all right, though?
Yeah, why wouldn't I be?

240
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:48,900
What day is it? Wednesday all day.
You got a hangover?

241
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:55,300
Ooh, I tell you what, put a quid
in that lottery syndicate. I'll pay
you back later. Yeah, um, I...

242
00:18:55,400 --> 00:19:02,300
I was just calling cos... I might
be late home. Is there something
wrong? No, I'm fine.

243
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:05,000
Top of the world!

244
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:11,300
Think THAT'S amazing,
you wanna see the bill.

245
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,000
That was five billion years ago.

246
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:16,700
So...

247
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:18,200
She's dead now.

248
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:23,400
Five billion years later,
my mum's dead.

249
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:25,400
Bundle of laughs, you are.

250
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,400
BIG RUMBLE

251
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:32,200
That's not supposed to happen.

252
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:35,700
Well, what was it? I'm just
getting green lights at this end.

253
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:42,400
Honoured guests may be reassured
that gravity pockets may cause
slight turbulence. Thanking you...

254
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:45,200
The whole place shook! I felt it!

255
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:51,000
I've hosted all sorts of events
on platforms 1, 3, 6 and 15 and
never felt the slightest tremor.

256
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:53,800
I warn you, if this lot decide
to sue...!

257
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:55,900
I'm gonna scan the infrastructure.

258
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:02,700
CLICKS AND SQUEAKS
What's that?

259
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:07,600
Control, I don't want to worry you
but I'm picking up readings...

260
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:12,400
I have no idea! They're small.
The scan says they're metal...

261
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:14,700
I don't know what they look like!

262
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:21,400
Although I imagine they might look
rather like that.

263
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:27,200
You're not on the guest list.

264
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:30,000
How did you get on board?

265
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:35,200
No! 'Sunfilter deactivated.'

266
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:36,600
No!

267
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:38,800
'Sunfilter descending.' No!

268
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:40,000
Sunfilter up!

269
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:41,900
No, no, no!

270
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,800
Control! Respond!
'Sunfilter descending.'

271
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:46,400
SUNFILTER UP!

272
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:49,600
'Sunfilter descending... '
HE SCREAMS

273
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:12,000
Indubitably, this is the Bad-Boo
scenario. I find the inherent laxity
of the unknown multiverse...

274
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:18,000
That wasn't a gravity pocket, I know
gravity pockets, and they don't feel
like that... What d'you think, Jabe?

275
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:21,900
Listen to the engines.
They've pitched up about 30 hertz.
Is that dodgy or what?!

276
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:28,200
It's the sound of metal - it doesn't
make any sense to me. Where's
the engine room? I don't know.

277
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:34,200
But the maintenance duct
is just behind our guest suite.
I could show you. And... your wife.

278
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:36,000
Oh, she's not my wife.

279
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:38,400
Partner? No. Concubine?

280
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:39,900
Nope.

281
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Prostitute? Whatever I am,
it must be invisible(!) D'you mind?!

282
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:51,500
Tell you what, you two go...
pollinate. I'll catch up with family.
Quick word with Michael Jackson.

283
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,400
Don't start a fight.

284
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:55,900
I'm all yours.

285
00:21:57,700 --> 00:21:59,600
And I want you home by midnight.

286
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:04,400
'Earth-death in 15 minutes.
Earth-death in 15 minutes.'

287
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:19,000
Who's in charge of Platform One?
Has it got a captain or what?

288
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:25,100
There's just the steward and staff.
All the rest is controlled by the
metalmind. You mean the computer?

289
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,700
Well, who controls that?
The Corporation.

290
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:31,900
They move Platform One
from one artistic event to another.

291
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:37,900
There's no-one from the corporation
on board? They're not needed.
This facility is purely automatic.

292
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,800
It's the height of the Alpha Class.

293
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:42,100
Nothing can go wrong. Unsinkable(?)

294
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:45,700
If you like. The nautical metaphor
is appropriate.

295
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:49,200
You're telling me! I was on board
another ship they called unsinkable.

296
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:52,300
I ended up clinging to an iceberg.
Wasn't half cold.

297
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:57,400
So what you're saying is
if we get in trouble,
there's no-one to help us out.

298
00:22:57,500 --> 00:23:00,200
I'm afraid not. Fantastic!

299
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:01,900
I don't understand.

300
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,800
In what way is that fantastic?

301
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:13,900
Soon the sun
will blossom into a red giant

302
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,500
And my home will die.

303
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:19,100
That's where I used to live,
when I was a little boy. Down there.

304
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:26,400
Mummy and Daddy had a house built
into the side of the Los Angeles
Crevasse. Ah, I'd have such fun.

305
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:30,200
What happened to everyone else?
The human race, where did it go?

306
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:34,400
They say mankind has touched
every star in the sky.

307
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:36,500
So you're not the last human.

308
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:40,100
I am the Last Pure Human.

309
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:43,100
The others... mingled.

310
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:48,200
Oh, they call themselves
New Humans and Protohumans and
Digihumans - even Human-ish -

311
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:50,800
but d'you know what I call them?

312
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:52,600
Mongrels.

313
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:55,400
Right(!) And you stayed behind.

314
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:58,300
I kept myself pure.

315
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,800
How many operations have you had?

316
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:03,000
708. Next week, it's 709.

317
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:06,000
I'm having my blood bleached.

318
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:09,100
Is that why you wanted a word?

319
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:14,600
You could be flatter, Rose.
You've got a little bit
of a... chin poking out.

320
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:17,900
I'd rather die.
Honestly, it doesn't hurt.

321
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,100
I mean it. I would rather die.

322
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:24,400
It's better to die than to live
like you, a bitchy trampoline.

323
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:27,100
Oh, well, what do YOU know?

324
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:29,800
I was born on that planet.

325
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:35,100
And so was my mum, and so was my dad,
and that makes me, officially,
the last human being in this room.

326
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:41,300
Cos you're not human. You've had it
all nipped and tucked and flattened
till there's nothing left.

327
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:46,600
Anything human got chucked
in the bin. You're just skin,
Cassandra, lipstick and skin.

328
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:48,200
Nice talking.

329
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:00,600
So, tell me, Jabe,
what's a tree like you
doing in a place like this?

330
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:05,200
Respect for the Earth.
Oh, come on, everyone on
this Platform's worth zillions.

331
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:09,500
Well. Perhaps it's a case of having
to be seen at the right occasions.

332
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:15,100
In case your share prices drop?
I know you lot, you've got massive
forests, roots everywhere.

333
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:21,100
And there's always money in land.
All the same, we respect the Earth
as family.

334
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:25,400
So many species evolved from
that planet. Mankind is only one.

335
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:31,000
I'm another. My ancestors were
transplanted from the planet down
below, and I'm a direct descendant

336
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:33,000
of the tropical rainforest.

337
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:34,500
Excuse me.

338
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:39,900
And what about your ancestry,
Doctor?

339
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:45,200
Perhaps you could tell
a story or two.

340
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:50,600
Perhaps a man only enjoys trouble
when there's nothing else left...?

341
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:54,300
I scanned you earlier.

342
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:58,300
The metalmachine had trouble
identifying your species.

343
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,700
It refused to admit your existence.

344
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:04,200
And even when it named you,
I wouldn't believe it.

345
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:07,100
But it was right.

346
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,500
I know where you're from!

347
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:16,900
Forgive me for intruding, but
it's remarkable that you even exist.

348
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,900
I just want to say...

349
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,900
how sorry I am.

350
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:42,400
SLOW CHUFFING

351
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,200
Is it me, or is it a bit nippy?

352
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,200
SHE CRIES OUT

353
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:21,400
Fair do's though - that's a great
bit of air-conditioning. Sort of
nice and old-fashioned.

354
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:23,500
Bet they call it retro.

355
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:26,000
Gotcha.

356
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:35,200
What the hell's that?
Is it part of the "retro"?

357
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:37,400
I don't think so, hold on.

358
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:47,200
Hey, nice liana. Thank you.

359
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:49,300
Not supposed to show them in public.

360
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:51,400
Don't worry, I won't tell anybody.

361
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:55,400
Now then, who's been bringing their
pets on board? What does it do?

362
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:58,600
Sabotage...
'Earth-death in ten minutes... '

363
00:27:58,700 --> 00:28:03,400
And the temperature's
about to rocket. Come on.
'... Earth death in ten minutes.'

364
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:05,400
The planet's end!

365
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:07,900
Come gather, come gather!

366
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,900
Bid farewell to the cradle
of civilisation.

367
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,400
Let us mourn her
with a traditional ballad.

368
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:21,800
INTRO TO: "Toxic"
sung by Britney Spears

369
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:25,800
# Baby, can't you see
I'm calling

370
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:28,800
# A guy like you
Should wear a warning

371
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:32,000
# It's dangerous
I'm fallin'... #

372
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:35,600
SQUEAKS AND TRILLS
All right, hold on, get back.

373
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:40,400
'Sunfilter rising.
Sunfilter rising.'

374
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:43,800
Is the Steward in there?
You can smell him.

375
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:48,500
Hold on. There's another sunfilter
programmed to descend.

376
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:51,500
#... Too high
Can't come down

377
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,000
# Losing my head
Spinning round and round

378
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:59,700
# Do you feel me now...? #

379
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:04,200
'Sunfilter descending.
Sunfilter descending... '

380
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:11,000
'Sunfilter descending... '

381
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:15,000
Let me out! Let me out!
'... Sunfilter descending... '

382
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:17,000
LOUD BANGING

383
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:19,400
Let me out! Let me out!

384
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:23,600
'... Sunfilter descending.
Sunfilter descending... '

385
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:25,400
MORE BANGING
Anyone in there?

386
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:30,400
Let me out! Oh, well,
it would be you(!) Open the door!

387
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:31,800
Give us two ticks...

388
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:35,800
'... Sunfilter descending.
Sunfilter descending... '

389
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:40,100
'Sunfilter rising. Sunfilter rising.

390
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:42,200
'Sunfilter rising.
Sunfilter rising... '

391
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:48,300
'... Sunfilter rising.
Sunfilter rising... '

392
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:53,300
'Sunfilter descending... '
Just what we need -
the computer's getting clever.

393
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:57,300
Stop mucking about! I'm not mucking
about! It's fighting back.

394
00:29:57,400 --> 00:30:00,500
'... Sunfilter descending... '
Open the door! I know!

395
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:04,400
'... Sunfilter descending... '
The lock's melted!

396
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:09,200
'... Sunfilter descending.
Sunfilter descending.

397
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:18,200
'Sunfilter rising.
Sunfilter rising... '

398
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:27,100
The whole thing's
jammed. I can't open the door.
Stay there, don't move.

399
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,800
Where am I gonna go - Ipswich(?)

400
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:30,900
'Earth-death in five minutes.'

401
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:39,200
The metalmachine confirms.
The spider devices have infiltrated
the whole of Platform One.

402
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:43,200
How's that possible? Our private
rooms are protected by a codewall.

403
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:45,300
(Moisturise me, moisturise me!)

404
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:49,400
Summon the Steward! I'm afraid the
Steward is dead.

405
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:52,000
THEY GASP AND MURMUR

406
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:55,100
Who killed him?

407
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:59,800
This whole event was sponsored
by the Face of Boe. He invited us.
Talk to the Face, talk to the Face!

408
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:03,700
Easy way of finding out. Someone
brought their little pet on board.

409
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:05,400
Let's send him back to master.

410
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:30,000
The Adherents of the Repeated Meme!
J'accuse!

411
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:35,400
That's all very well,
and really kind of obvious but,
if you stop and think about it...

412
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:38,600
A repeated meme is just an idea.

413
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:41,700
And that's all they are, an idea.

414
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:48,800
Remote-control 'droids. Nice little
cover for the real troublemaker.

415
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:51,300
Go on, Jimbo. Go home.

416
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:55,200
GUESTS GASP

417
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:58,300
I bet you were the school swot
and never got kissed.

418
00:31:58,400 --> 00:31:59,700
At arms!

419
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:01,400
What you gonna do, moisturise me?

420
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:03,000
With acid.

421
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:07,200
Oh, you're too late, anyway.
My spiders have control
of the mainframe.

422
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:12,600
Oh, you all carried them as gifts,
tax-free, past every codewall.

423
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:18,200
I'm not just a pretty face.
Sabotaging a ship while you're
inside it, how stupid's that?

424
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:21,300
I'd hoped to manufacture
a hostage situation.

425
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:26,000
With myself as one of the victims,
the compensation
would have been enormous.

426
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:29,600
Five billion years,
and it still comes down to money.

427
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:32,500
D'you think it's cheap,
looking like this?

428
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:35,400
Flatness costs a fortune!

429
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:37,800
I am the Last Human, Doctor.

430
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:42,500
Me, not that freaky little kid
of yours.

431
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:44,800
Arrest her! The infidel!

432
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:49,200
Oh, shut it, pixie!
I've still got my final option.

433
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:51,500
'Earth-death in three minutes,
Earth-death in three minutes... '

434
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:55,400
And here it comes. You're
just as useful dead, all of you.

435
00:32:55,500 --> 00:33:00,400
I have shares in
your rival companies. They'll triple
in price as soon as you're dead.

436
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:04,500
My spiders are primed and ready
to destroy the safety systems.

437
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:06,800
How did that old Earth song go?

438
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:08,500
"Burn baby, burn."

439
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:10,400
Then you'll burn with us!

440
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:12,600
Oh, I'm so sorry!

441
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:17,400
I know the use of teleportation is
strictly forbidden, but...

442
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:19,300
I'm such a naughty thing.

443
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:19,700
Spiders, activate!

444
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:22,300
Spiders, activate!

445
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:25,800
THUNDEROUS WHOOSHES

446
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:34,600
Force-fields gone,
with the planet about to explode...

447
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:36,800
At least it'll be quick.

448
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:43,300
Just like my fifth husband... Oops!
Oh, shame on me! Bye bye, darlings.

449
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:45,900
'Safety systems failing... '
Bye-bye, my darlings!

450

'... Heat levels rising... '

451
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,700
Reset the computer!
Only the Steward would know how.

452
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:56,200
No, we can do it by hand.
There must be a "system restore"
switch. Jabe, come on.

453
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:58,200
You lot, just chill.

'... Heat levels rising.

00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:52,300
You can't, the heat's gonna vent
through this place. I know. Jabe!

462
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:56,500
You're made of wood. Then stop
wasting time - Time Lord.

I'm full of ideas.
I'm bristling with 'em!

490
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:24,900
Idea number one.
Teleportation through 5, 000 degrees
needs some kind of feed.

491
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:29,300
Idea number two.
This feed must be hidden nearby.

492
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:33,600
Idea number three.

493
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:38,000
If you're as clever as me, then a
teleportation-feed can be reversed.

00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:48,400
The last human. So.

497
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:50,400
You passed my little test. Bravo!

498
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:53,500
This makes you eligible to join, um,
the... the Human Club.

499
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:58,600
People have died, Cassandra.
You murdered them. It depends
on your definition of people.

500
00:38:58,700 --> 00:39:02,600
And that's enough of a technicality
to keep your lawyers dizzy
for centuries.

501
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:05,800
Take me to court then, Doctor,

502
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:08,700
and watch me smile and cry...
QUIET CREAKS

503
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,800
..and flutter. And creak?

504
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:14,400
And what? Creak. You're creaking.

505
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:15,800
What?

506
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:18,800
Agh! I-I'm drying out!

507
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:22,600
Oh, sweet heavens!
Moisturise me, moisturise me!

508
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:28,400
Where are my surgeons,
my lovely boys? It's too hot!
YOU raised the temperature.

509
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:30,000
Have pity!

510
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:32,300
SHE GROWLS:
Moisturise me!

511
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:34,400
Oh, Doctor!

512
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:39,300
Oh, Doctor, I'll do anything...!
Help her. Everything has its time.
And everything dies.

513
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:43,000
I'm... too... young...!

514
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:58,800
'Shuttles four and six departing.

515
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:02,500
'This unit now closing
down for maintenance.'

516
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:19,400
The end of the Earth.

517
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:22,000
It's gone.

518
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:28,700
We were too busy saving ourselves.
No-one saw it go.

519
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:37,100
All those years, all that history,
and no-one was even looking.

520
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:40,000
It's just...

521
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:43,400
Come with me.

522
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:12,700
A TODDLER CRIES

523
00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:26,700
Big Issue!

524
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,900
Big Issue...!

525
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:34,600
You think it'll last forever,
people and cars and concrete.

526
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:36,600
But it won't.

527
00:41:36,700 --> 00:41:39,100
One day, it's all gone.

528
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:41,600
Even the sky.

529
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:49,800
My planet's gone.

530
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:52,600
It's dead.

531
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:57,000
It burned, like the Earth.

532
00:41:57,100 --> 00:41:59,800
It's just rocks and dust.

533
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:02,700
Before its time.

534
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:05,800
What happened?

535
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:10,100
There was a war, and we lost.

536
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:11,700
A war with who?

537
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:17,600
What about your people?

538
00:42:18,700 --> 00:42:20,800
I'm a Time Lord.

539
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:23,800
I'm the last of the Time Lords.

540
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:25,800
They're all gone.

541
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:27,800
I'm the only survivor.

542
00:42:28,900 --> 00:42:31,800
I'm left travelling on my own
cos there's no-one else.

543
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:34,800
There's me.

544
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:41,400
You've seen how dangerous it is.
D'you wanna go home?

545
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:46,300
I don't know.

546
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
I want...

547
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:55,200
Can you smell chips?

548
00:42:55,300 --> 00:42:57,100
Yeah.

549
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:59,400
Yeah! I want chips.

550
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:05,900
Me too. Right, then. Before
you get me back in that box, chips
it is. And you can pay. No money.

551
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:09,600
What sort of date are you? Come on,
then, tightwad. Chips are on me.

552
00:43:09,700 --> 00:43:13,600
We've only got five billion years
till the shops close.

553
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:26,200
Now - you've seen the future,
so let's have a look at the past.

554
00:43:26,300 --> 00:43:31,400
1860, how does 1860 sound?
What happened in 1860?
I don't know. Let's find out.

555
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:37,800
..I can't believe she's gone.
Not gone, Mr Redpath, sir.
Merely sleeping.

556
00:43:38,900 --> 00:43:44,200
She's up and on her feet and out
there somewhere. Mr Sneed for shame,
how many more times? It's ungodly!

557
00:43:44,300 --> 00:43:47,300
'... Excuse me, sir.
Mr Dickens, this is your call.'

558
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:52,000
..Use the sight. Find the old lady
or you're dismissed.

559
00:43:52,100 --> 00:43:54,600
What phantasmagoria is this?

560
00:43:56,900 --> 00:43:58,400
That's more like it!

561
00:44:34,100 --> 00:44:37,200
