Join Confidential this
Christmas for double the action,

2
00:00:02,823 --> 00:00:06,622
double The Doctor, and a few
extra treats to fill your stockings.

3
00:00:06,623 --> 00:00:11,462
This episode is a Gothic cyber
Victorian epic nightmare.

4
00:00:11,463 --> 00:00:15,182
# I used to rule the world

5
00:00:15,183 --> 00:00:17,622
# Seas would rise
When I gave the word

6
00:00:17,623 --> 00:00:21,942
# Now in the morning I sleep alone

7
00:00:21,943 --> 00:00:25,902
# Sweep the streets
I used to own... # Action!

8
00:00:25,903 --> 00:00:27,582
The Cybermen are quite up there.

9
00:00:27,583 --> 00:00:29,902
We haven't seen them for a couple
of years,

10
00:00:29,903 --> 00:00:32,583
so it was great to see
them marching through the snow.

11
00:00:39,583 --> 00:00:41,383
Who the hell is that? Hello.

12
00:00:42,503 --> 00:00:43,743
His name, sir...

13
00:00:44,783 --> 00:00:46,503
..is The Doctor.

14
00:00:46,543 --> 00:00:46,583
..is The Doctor.

19
00:01:17,703 --> 00:01:19,503
it's an early
scene when The Doctor arrives

20
00:01:21,663 --> 00:01:23,982
in this courtyard and
meets the other Doctor.

21
00:01:23,983 --> 00:01:27,782
Hold on, who are you? I'm The Doctor.
Simply, The Doctor.

22
00:01:27,783 --> 00:01:30,262
The one, the only, and the best.

23
00:01:30,263 --> 00:01:31,982
We start out with a bit of a mystery

24
00:01:31,983 --> 00:01:34,542
which again is unusual
for a Christmas special.

25
00:01:34,543 --> 00:01:35,902
Who is this man?

26
00:01:35,903 --> 00:01:39,262
If you could step back, sir,
this is a job for a Time Lord.

27
00:01:39,263 --> 00:01:42,622
He's had information
into his head, so he's slightly

28
00:01:42,623 --> 00:01:44,582
been brainwashed into a situation

29
00:01:44,583 --> 00:01:46,702
where he believes he's someone else.

30
00:01:46,703 --> 00:01:49,262
At the start,
you would absolutely believe

31
00:01:49,263 --> 00:01:51,302
this is who The Doctor has become.

32
00:01:51,303 --> 00:01:55,943
I love that conceit that The
Doctor's companion in this episode

33
00:01:56,023 --> 00:01:57,182
would be himself.

34
00:01:57,183 --> 00:01:58,742
THEY LAUGH

35
00:01:58,743 --> 00:02:01,902
David Morrissey is in some ways
the great Doctor we'll never have.

36
00:02:01,903 --> 00:02:05,262
I've been hunting this beast for
a good fortnight. Step back, sir.

37
00:02:05,263 --> 00:02:07,222
We've just seen a Cybershade
jump on a wall.

38
00:02:07,223 --> 00:02:09,302
The other Doctor and then The Doctor

39
00:02:09,303 --> 00:02:11,462
grab onto the Cybershade
with a rope,

40
00:02:11,463 --> 00:02:14,182
and then get wheeched up
through a window.

41
00:02:14,183 --> 00:02:16,903
I might be in a
little bit of trouble.

42
00:02:23,263 --> 00:02:24,542
So to make this happen,

43
00:02:24,543 --> 00:02:27,982
we've put wires in the rope
and hung the actors off the wires.

44
00:02:27,983 --> 00:02:30,742
Once more for a rehearsal, please,
folks.

45
00:02:30,743 --> 00:02:33,062
Is there a way to
get a bit more stable?

46
00:02:33,063 --> 00:02:37,902
Wires are always fun the first couple
of times you get hauled up and down,

47
00:02:37,903 --> 00:02:40,102
because it is a bit like flying.

48
00:02:40,103 --> 00:02:43,702
But come take 10, when
your back starts to go

49
00:02:43,703 --> 00:02:48,302
and other areas are
needing some attention,

50
00:02:48,303 --> 00:02:50,542
it can start to feel
like a long day.

51
00:02:50,543 --> 00:02:51,543
Action!

52
00:02:52,743 --> 00:02:55,542
Ah! I think I might be in
a bit of trouble.

53
00:02:55,543 --> 00:02:58,022
Nothing changes. I've got you.

54
00:02:58,023 --> 00:03:00,502
Hold it there. Thank you very much.

55
00:03:00,503 --> 00:03:02,502
Reset, guys, please.

56
00:03:02,503 --> 00:03:05,182
Being in a harness
for quite a long time,

57
00:03:05,183 --> 00:03:10,302
usually in a pair of highly
padded cycling shorts to protect

58
00:03:10,303 --> 00:03:13,743
um, what dignity you might have
left after three years of this.

59
00:03:15,543 --> 00:03:18,582
Look at that. Sexy!

60
00:03:18,583 --> 00:03:21,462
Actually, it was fine for
the majority of the day.

61
00:03:21,463 --> 00:03:25,062
We were on there
for four or five hours.

62
00:03:25,063 --> 00:03:27,582
Then we broke and I
took the harness off.

63
00:03:27,583 --> 00:03:30,262
Then we had to go
back into the harness.

64
00:03:30,263 --> 00:03:32,182
It was going back into the harness

65
00:03:32,183 --> 00:03:34,142
and doing it again, that really
hurts.

66
00:03:34,143 --> 00:03:36,302
I don't know why.
I bruised all my thighs.

67
00:03:36,303 --> 00:03:39,342
Good position? It is a good position.
OK, thanks.

68
00:03:39,343 --> 00:03:43,662
That's a major cheat. We went up the
side of that building about 17 times,

69
00:03:43,663 --> 00:03:46,783
making it look three or four
times the length it actually was.

70
00:03:47,903 --> 00:03:51,582
There can be some chafing and
there can be some unpleasantness,

71
00:03:51,583 --> 00:03:54,022
but you forget about that when it's
cut together

72
00:03:54,023 --> 00:03:55,862
and hopefully all looks exciting.

73
00:03:55,863 --> 00:03:58,382
# Secrets of the universe

74
00:03:58,383 --> 00:04:00,462
# The mysteries of life

75
00:04:00,463 --> 00:04:03,222
# And the things
That don't make sense

76
00:04:03,223 --> 00:04:09,143
# All come clear cos the music
Takes me up... #

77
00:04:14,383 --> 00:04:19,063
# The music takes me up... #

78
00:04:20,503 --> 00:04:23,942
I'm not letting you out of my sight,
Doctor. Don't you recognise me?

79
00:04:23,943 --> 00:04:25,942
No. Should I? Have we met?

80
00:04:25,943 --> 00:04:29,262
It's not slapstick, but
it's quite a strange thing

81
00:04:29,263 --> 00:04:31,182
that they have to go through.

82
00:04:31,183 --> 00:04:32,542
This is hardly the right time

83
00:04:32,543 --> 00:04:34,742
for me to go through
my social calendar. Argh!

84
00:04:34,743 --> 00:04:36,782
We want these two men
to come together quickly.

85
00:04:36,783 --> 00:04:39,102
They could do that through dialogue
but it's much better fun

86
00:04:39,103 --> 00:04:40,742
to have them pulled along by a rope.

87
00:04:40,743 --> 00:04:43,862
After that they're friends,
no matter what happens.

88
00:04:43,863 --> 00:04:45,462
It's shorthand to
bring them together.

89
00:04:45,463 --> 00:04:47,582
THEY LAUGH

90
00:04:47,583 --> 00:04:49,542
Oh!

91
00:04:49,543 --> 00:04:51,703
THEY LAUGH RIOTOUSLY

92
00:04:53,543 --> 00:04:55,143
It's quite a juicy part to cast.

93
00:04:57,303 --> 00:04:58,463
Oh, that's new.

94
00:04:59,663 --> 00:05:01,662
BOTH: Allons-y.

95
00:05:01,663 --> 00:05:05,222
Every actor wants to create good
characters and be in good stories,

96
00:05:05,223 --> 00:05:10,982
and Russell and his team here have
really created that with Doctor Who.

97
00:05:10,983 --> 00:05:12,942
You ask a lot of questions.

98
00:05:12,943 --> 00:05:14,503
I'm your companion.

99
00:05:15,663 --> 00:05:19,462
Whenever there were articles written
about who's going to take over,

100
00:05:19,463 --> 00:05:21,862
there's always four or five names
that crop up

101
00:05:21,863 --> 00:05:24,102
and Dave Morrissey
is usually in there.

102
00:05:24,103 --> 00:05:26,142
That's not why we
got him for this part.

103
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:29,142
Dave Morrissey's name crops up
because he's a great actor

104
00:05:29,143 --> 00:05:31,742
and we wanted a great actor.

105
00:05:31,743 --> 00:05:34,502
There's no way we thought, "Let's
play into the game

106
00:05:34,503 --> 00:05:37,142
"of casting someone who
might be the next Doctor."

107
00:05:37,143 --> 00:05:39,742
That's too complicated.
You just want to cast a great actor.

108
00:05:39,743 --> 00:05:43,423
I've worked with David before.
We did a series called Blackpool.

109
00:05:46,903 --> 00:05:49,823
Which was a musical, actually.
We danced the tango together...

110
00:05:51,863 --> 00:05:55,062
..to These Boots Are Made For
Walking, a Nancy Sinatra number.

111
00:05:55,063 --> 00:05:59,423
# You keep lying
When you ought to be truthing

112
00:06:00,743 --> 00:06:04,502
# And you keep losing
When you ought to not bet... #

113
00:06:04,503 --> 00:06:06,782
We had a really great time on that.

114
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:09,982
It was a very dark comedy-musical.

115
00:06:09,983 --> 00:06:11,262
We all sang and danced.

116
00:06:11,263 --> 00:06:14,222
# These boots are made for walking

117
00:06:14,223 --> 00:06:17,462
# And that's just what they'll do

118
00:06:17,463 --> 00:06:22,582
# One of these days these boots
Are gonna walk all over you. #

119
00:06:22,583 --> 00:06:24,062
We were very good.

120
00:06:24,063 --> 00:06:28,262
The Doctor at first thinks he's
another Time Lord and then gradually

121
00:06:28,263 --> 00:06:32,903
he realises that this man is
working under an illusion.

122
00:06:34,183 --> 00:06:35,703
But I'm The Doctor.

123
00:06:37,863 --> 00:06:41,662
You became The Doctor. It
becomes apparent in the story that

124
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:45,862
the next Doctor is in fact not a
Time Lord but a human, Jackson Lake.

125
00:06:45,863 --> 00:06:48,382
Let me just check.

126
00:06:48,383 --> 00:06:50,422
You told them you were The Doctor.
Why did you do that?

127
00:06:50,423 --> 00:06:53,262
Oh, just...protecting you.

128
00:06:53,263 --> 00:06:55,622
There's a tiny moment where
we cut some lines of dialogue.

129
00:06:55,623 --> 00:06:58,902
The Doctor listens to his heartbeat
and originally in the script

130
00:06:58,903 --> 00:07:00,982
you realised he was
listening to one heart.

131
00:07:00,983 --> 00:07:03,902
We took that out just to keep
the mystery going longer.

132
00:07:03,903 --> 00:07:05,622
I can't remember...

133
00:07:05,623 --> 00:07:09,142
what happened to me.
What did they do?

134
00:07:09,143 --> 00:07:12,622
I approached it in that way of a
character who is suffering from

135
00:07:12,623 --> 00:07:18,862
memory loss and is working on an
energy that is trying to get him

136
00:07:18,863 --> 00:07:22,102
to block out something that
has been very painful for him,

137
00:07:22,103 --> 00:07:23,383
that's happened to him.

138
00:07:25,863 --> 00:07:27,463
JL.

139
00:07:28,463 --> 00:07:30,942
The watch is Jackson Lake's.

140
00:07:30,943 --> 00:07:33,182
The things that he's invented,

141
00:07:33,183 --> 00:07:37,982
particularly the TARDIS that he's
invented himself, save the day.

142
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:40,142
All that bravery.

143
00:07:40,143 --> 00:07:43,622
Saving Rosita, defending London town.

144
00:07:43,623 --> 00:07:47,662
Hm? The invention,
building a TARDIS, that's all you.

145
00:07:47,663 --> 00:07:50,182
So actually in small ways,
vital ways,

146
00:07:50,183 --> 00:07:53,463
he becomes a proper Doctor
and helps to save the Earth.

147
00:08:03,503 --> 00:08:06,582
At your service, Doctor. He
would have been a wonderful Doctor.

148
00:08:06,583 --> 00:08:07,902
The point is in the end

149
00:08:07,903 --> 00:08:10,982
that for the course of that
story he was The Doctor.

150
00:08:10,983 --> 00:08:14,662
At one point my character, when
he is completely delusional

151
00:08:14,663 --> 00:08:20,102
and does think he's a superhero, he
decides to lasso this Cybershade.

152
00:08:20,103 --> 00:08:23,302
As an actor I have done very
little lassoing in my life.

153
00:08:23,303 --> 00:08:27,542
So we got in this guy who taught me
how to lasso, and it was brilliant.

154
00:08:27,543 --> 00:08:28,983
My name is Guido Louis.

155
00:08:31,663 --> 00:08:33,863
Gonna catch a monster, be exciting.

156
00:08:37,023 --> 00:08:41,903
I'm called in for the day to show
David Morrissey about roping.

157
00:08:44,863 --> 00:08:45,983
Ha-ha!

158
00:08:47,223 --> 00:08:50,662
It was really good. I spent quite
a lot of the morning

159
00:08:50,663 --> 00:08:52,142
with him and his rope.

160
00:08:52,143 --> 00:08:53,263
This is called a lasso.

161
00:08:55,823 --> 00:08:57,502
You have the loop ready and now

162
00:08:57,503 --> 00:08:59,782
you swing it above
your head in this way.

163
00:08:59,783 --> 00:09:02,382
Throw it at the target,
hopefully you hit it.

164
00:09:02,383 --> 00:09:07,702
That's good. The lasso we're
using today is not an actual lasso.

165
00:09:07,703 --> 00:09:09,422
It's an ordinary rope.

166
00:09:09,423 --> 00:09:10,862
Quite heavy, quite thick,

167
00:09:10,863 --> 00:09:13,103
a lot heavier than I
would use for a lasso.

168
00:09:15,143 --> 00:09:17,062
That's it.

169
00:09:17,063 --> 00:09:19,422
But I will show him how to
lay it in his hands

170
00:09:19,423 --> 00:09:20,982
and swing it above his head.

171
00:09:20,983 --> 00:09:23,023
We can do it. We'll be all right.

172
00:09:25,183 --> 00:09:29,622
I had to aim at the first assistant
and I got him first time,

173
00:09:29,623 --> 00:09:31,143
which I was very happy about.

174
00:09:34,183 --> 00:09:35,422
Ha!

175
00:09:35,423 --> 00:09:36,782
Ha!

176
00:09:36,783 --> 00:09:41,142
So yeah, my lasso skills are
up there now.

177
00:09:41,143 --> 00:09:44,543
If I have to give up the
day job I can join a circus.

178
00:09:47,423 --> 00:09:48,863
Excellent.

179
00:09:50,863 --> 00:09:53,542
In an abandoned Welsh warehouse,

180
00:09:53,543 --> 00:09:57,342
it's time for the two
Doctors to go on the pull.

181
00:09:57,343 --> 00:10:00,862
Today I've been pulling The Doctors
along through the Warehouse,

182
00:10:00,863 --> 00:10:03,782
which is linking from the scene we
were shooting yesterday

183
00:10:03,783 --> 00:10:06,462
where I was pulling them
up a wall, Spiderman-style.

184
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:09,862
So Ruari, you're running down here.

185
00:10:09,863 --> 00:10:12,942
We'll just track along in the
camera vehicle next to you, OK?

186
00:10:12,943 --> 00:10:15,622
I wanted a great big opening
Christmas Day stunt.

187
00:10:15,623 --> 00:10:16,862
I wanted it to be funny.

188
00:10:16,863 --> 00:10:19,262
Obviously, ideally,
you're on all fours,

189
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:23,782
but it's going to be impossible so,
um, it's to get as much speed,

190
00:10:23,783 --> 00:10:27,622
but give the impression that you're
kind of lolloping low. OK.

191
00:10:27,623 --> 00:10:29,983
Then look back over your shoulder.

192
00:10:32,823 --> 00:10:34,343
A little bit quicker.

193
00:10:37,223 --> 00:10:39,382
That's good. Chuck some looks back.

194
00:10:39,383 --> 00:10:40,942
Once they're off the vertical

195
00:10:40,943 --> 00:10:43,222
and start going horizontally,
it's just funny.

196
00:10:43,223 --> 00:10:46,342
I've got to run on all fours,
on the impression of all fours,

197
00:10:46,343 --> 00:10:47,782
as quickly as possible,

198
00:10:47,783 --> 00:10:50,983
while two people hold onto the rope
behind me, which is interesting.

199
00:11:05,783 --> 00:11:07,782
In my head, I have rough
practicalities.

200
00:11:07,783 --> 00:11:09,623
Basically, I knew it
would be a nightmare.

201
00:11:10,663 --> 00:11:15,462
They'd set up this rig
on the back of a quad bike.

202
00:11:15,463 --> 00:11:17,662
Basically just
underneath their bums

203
00:11:17,663 --> 00:11:19,463
was a little saddle pad to sit on.

204
00:11:21,543 --> 00:11:27,382
It was just kind of two little
seats on a kind of metal frame.

205
00:11:27,383 --> 00:11:29,662
I sat strapped in one, David
in the other,

206
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:31,342
and we're holding these ropes

207
00:11:31,343 --> 00:11:34,343
and we just get dragged endlessly
round this warehouse.

208
00:11:36,223 --> 00:11:39,942
On days like that, when two actors
are being pulled across a warehouse

209
00:11:39,943 --> 00:11:41,582
on a quad bike on their bums...

210
00:11:41,583 --> 00:11:43,622
Oh! Oh!

211
00:11:43,623 --> 00:11:45,662
That's why I don't
go on set very often.

212
00:11:45,663 --> 00:11:48,142
You write that stuff
and go, "Over to you!"

213
00:11:48,143 --> 00:11:51,383
Three, two, one. Action.

214
00:11:53,583 --> 00:11:57,822
It's the sort of thing that when
you're first told you'll be sitting

215
00:11:57,823 --> 00:12:01,502
on a bit of tin being dragged along
the floor by a quad bike,

216
00:12:01,503 --> 00:12:03,262
you can't quite imagine...

217
00:12:03,263 --> 00:12:07,942
either that it's going to work
or that it's not going to kill you.

218
00:12:07,943 --> 00:12:10,822
Cut there. Don't try
that at home, kids.

219
00:12:10,823 --> 00:12:13,222
It signals up the kind of
episode it's going to be.

220
00:12:13,223 --> 00:12:15,862
A romp, slapstick, we'll
have fun along the way.

221
00:12:15,863 --> 00:12:18,382
BOTH SCREAM

222
00:12:18,383 --> 00:12:21,502
It was so funny. The two of them
just act their hearts out in that.

223
00:12:21,503 --> 00:12:23,422
Imagine being pulled
along by a quad bike

224
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:26,542
and having to do all that acting
at the same time. It's brilliant.

225
00:12:26,543 --> 00:12:28,823
It was really good fun.

226
00:12:40,703 --> 00:12:46,182
We had real fun. Again it was
pretty uncomfortable the next day.

227
00:12:46,183 --> 00:12:48,623
But David and I had quite a laugh.

228
00:12:52,943 --> 00:12:54,902
So just what is it that makes

229
00:12:54,903 --> 00:12:58,182
The Doctor Who Christmas
Special so special?

230
00:12:58,183 --> 00:12:59,702
I love the Christmas specials.

231
00:12:59,703 --> 00:13:03,182
Mums and dads and kids, more than
any other day of the year,

232
00:13:03,183 --> 00:13:06,622
more than all the Saturdays, will be
sitting down and watching telly.

233
00:13:06,623 --> 00:13:11,702
It's just the scale, the ambition
in the writing. Anything goes.

234
00:13:11,703 --> 00:13:13,943
One part of you wants to make
it bigger and better each year.

235
00:13:15,703 --> 00:13:17,502
At the same time, you
shouldn't go mad with that.

236
00:13:17,503 --> 00:13:19,742
So long as you've got a good story.
That's the main thing.

237
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:24,223
Witness me, mankind.
A CyberKing of all.

238
00:13:25,783 --> 00:13:27,542
It's a CyberKing.

239
00:13:27,543 --> 00:13:30,462
In some ways last year with
Kylie Minogue and the Titanic,

240
00:13:30,463 --> 00:13:32,103
that's about as big as you can go.

241
00:13:33,383 --> 00:13:35,542
It's tempting in
a way to try and copy that

242
00:13:35,543 --> 00:13:37,102
but what would you have done?

243
00:13:37,103 --> 00:13:40,342
You'd have Cheryl Cole on board
the Hindenburg or something...

244
00:13:40,343 --> 00:13:42,222
Now I say that...
HE LAUGHS

245
00:13:42,223 --> 00:13:46,382
Record viewing figures! It's got
more intimacy than we've had before.

246
00:13:46,383 --> 00:13:49,582
Then again, when you get the
CyberKing stepping on London,

247
00:13:49,583 --> 00:13:51,022
it's not exactly subtle.

248
00:13:51,023 --> 00:13:52,783
So we've still got the size as well.

249
00:13:54,463 --> 00:13:56,062
It's got that Dickensian feel to it.

250
00:13:56,063 --> 00:13:57,983
THEY SCREAM

251
00:14:00,103 --> 00:14:03,942
Dickens, if he thought of putting
a great big robot

252
00:14:03,943 --> 00:14:05,983
in A Christmas Carol,
he would have done it.

253
00:14:07,543 --> 00:14:09,543
I like to think I've
improved on Dickens!

254
00:14:15,343 --> 00:14:19,703
The graveyard scene was a
collective favourite for everybody.

255
00:14:21,783 --> 00:14:24,902
We've been filming in
this graveyard in Newport.

256
00:14:24,903 --> 00:14:27,703
We're saying it's a
Victorian funeral happening.

257
00:14:28,743 --> 00:14:31,142
The visuals just popped
right off the page.

258
00:14:31,143 --> 00:14:34,102
You always want to give the
Cybermen a nice big entrance,

259
00:14:34,103 --> 00:14:36,182
some kind of barnstorming appearance.

260
00:14:36,183 --> 00:14:37,862
What manner of men are they?

261
00:14:37,863 --> 00:14:39,343
Cybermen.

262
00:14:43,103 --> 00:14:46,782
You had people clashing into
each other from nowhere.

263
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:49,063
You have Cybershapes leaping over
their backs.

264
00:14:54,623 --> 00:14:58,423
There's a lovely top shot where you
see people scrambling over graves.

265
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:10,783
Just nightmarish.

266
00:15:14,503 --> 00:15:15,902
You monstrous witch!

267
00:15:15,903 --> 00:15:18,582
Merry Christmas to you, too.

268
00:15:18,583 --> 00:15:23,182
This time I thought,
a great entrance is the snow.

269
00:15:23,183 --> 00:15:25,782
You had the white snow, these
men in black

270
00:15:25,783 --> 00:15:27,982
and then the figure of Miss Hartigan

271
00:15:27,983 --> 00:15:30,462
in this scarlet dress coming
through the snow.

272
00:15:30,463 --> 00:15:32,582
So, all the components were there.

273
00:15:32,583 --> 00:15:37,702
It was just a question of marrying
the seductiveness of Miss Hartigan,

274
00:15:37,703 --> 00:15:40,503
and that femme-fatale element
and the horror of the Cybermen.

275
00:15:42,943 --> 00:15:46,982
You've got the soft snow and the
cold chrome steel of the Cybermen.

276
00:15:46,983 --> 00:15:50,102
Amid all the statues and graves
and this odd match

277
00:15:50,103 --> 00:15:53,422
with all the silvers and greys
of the snow and the metal

278
00:15:53,423 --> 00:15:54,982
all sort of worked together.

279
00:15:54,983 --> 00:15:57,342
The Cybermen looked right
in that setting.

280
00:15:57,343 --> 00:16:00,942
With the Cybermen, because of the
whole marching army

281
00:16:00,943 --> 00:16:03,382
it's good to be a good team.

282
00:16:03,383 --> 00:16:07,702
You work out little ways of how to
do things and how to count things,

283
00:16:07,703 --> 00:16:10,582
and how we're all going
to stop at the same time

284
00:16:10,583 --> 00:16:12,982
and what's the
best way for everybody.

285
00:16:12,983 --> 00:16:15,182
If I stay to the right,

286
00:16:15,183 --> 00:16:20,102
this side, then hopefully it'll give
you enough room if you do pass me,

287
00:16:20,103 --> 00:16:22,182
to take over, if I'm killing.

288
00:16:22,183 --> 00:16:26,782
It's kind of funny, really. They're
a lovely, normal bunch of blokes

289
00:16:26,783 --> 00:16:29,702
and they're sweating away
in those suits.

290
00:16:29,703 --> 00:16:31,902
I think they have a
pretty tough time of it.

291
00:16:31,903 --> 00:16:34,542
Mind you, I wore a really
tight corset all day

292
00:16:34,543 --> 00:16:37,262
so it's uncomfortable
for everyone, really.

293
00:16:37,263 --> 00:16:41,342
There's basically a number of key
choreographed elements

294
00:16:41,343 --> 00:16:46,182
that were basically stunts that I
wanted to put into the action.

295
00:16:46,183 --> 00:16:47,782
What if two guys clash?

296
00:16:47,783 --> 00:16:49,502
They collide and fall over?

297
00:16:49,503 --> 00:16:51,942
Then a Cyberman comes towards him

298
00:16:51,943 --> 00:16:54,382
and the other one pushes
him to save himself.

299
00:16:54,383 --> 00:16:57,342
It's quite restrictive
with the choreography

300
00:16:57,343 --> 00:17:00,502
because the Cybermen have
got limited movement.

301
00:17:00,503 --> 00:17:03,822
It's all about maximising the
space and the distance.

302
00:17:03,823 --> 00:17:05,102
I went in with certain ideas

303
00:17:05,103 --> 00:17:07,142
and Tom threw up
other things in the day.

304
00:17:07,143 --> 00:17:11,182
We're just having you
two bump into each other,

305
00:17:11,183 --> 00:17:15,703
like stumble, and then as Paul comes
you just do that with Nick, push him.

306
00:17:17,383 --> 00:17:20,863
Rehearsing and action!

307
00:17:24,903 --> 00:17:29,822
Basically, it was to make the
mayhem when the Cybermen attack

308
00:17:29,823 --> 00:17:32,662
just look as chaotic as possible.

309
00:17:32,663 --> 00:17:35,742
One leaps over the grave,
clambers over the earth, and legs it.

310
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:37,182
He falls down over the earth.

311
00:17:37,183 --> 00:17:39,822
The other one comes up this way
and falls over. That way.

312
00:17:39,823 --> 00:17:41,502
Takes a tumble and falls over.

313
00:17:41,503 --> 00:17:45,062
Max, can you do me a favour
and run the other way, please?

314
00:17:45,063 --> 00:17:48,582
I think we'll have four of you,
in a bit of a broken line

315
00:17:48,583 --> 00:17:50,302
coming out from the mist up there.

316
00:17:50,303 --> 00:17:52,982
We'll spread you out and you'll start
walking down.

317
00:17:52,983 --> 00:17:54,342
It's very beautiful.

318
00:17:54,343 --> 00:17:56,622
It's very Tim Burton, almost.

319
00:17:56,623 --> 00:18:01,542
We had acres of snow,
it was a beautiful day.

320
00:18:01,543 --> 00:18:03,742
It's very hard with the graveyard.

321
00:18:03,743 --> 00:18:06,742
It was a great, big,
open Victorian graveyard

322
00:18:06,743 --> 00:18:09,862
and that entire area has
to be covered in snow.

323
00:18:09,863 --> 00:18:13,182
We've got a lot of dressed
snow, which is paper snow,

324
00:18:13,183 --> 00:18:15,462
all around the graves as you can see.

325
00:18:15,463 --> 00:18:19,222
This tree in the background
and these headstones.

326
00:18:19,223 --> 00:18:23,222
# Deep beneath the cover of
Another perfect wonder

327
00:18:23,223 --> 00:18:27,942
# Where it's so white as snow. #

328
00:18:27,943 --> 00:18:31,062
As well as that we've got
falling snow and mist.

329
00:18:31,063 --> 00:18:33,902
Just to create the sense
of that real moodiness.

330
00:18:33,903 --> 00:18:36,742
It's basically tiny little particles
of paper,

331
00:18:36,743 --> 00:18:40,222
which are just sprayed
across the set from this giant hose.

332
00:18:40,223 --> 00:18:42,902
It looks fabulous but it sticks
to your shoes,

333
00:18:42,903 --> 00:18:45,662
it goes up your trousers,
it gets everywhere.

334
00:18:45,663 --> 00:18:47,862
If it rains,
it turns to papier-mache.

335
00:18:47,863 --> 00:18:51,143
Danny, just cover the
footprints just there.

336
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:55,862
They're starting to get into the
frame. You're starting to see them.

337
00:18:55,863 --> 00:19:00,462
There's snow everywhere, I'm
quite lucky I'm not clearing it up.

338
00:19:00,463 --> 00:19:02,782
It was a great scene,
one of my favourite scenes.

339
00:19:02,783 --> 00:19:04,102
I really enjoyed doing it.

340
00:19:04,103 --> 00:19:06,062
Take one, A camera.

341
00:19:06,063 --> 00:19:09,663
Shooting and...action!

342
00:19:19,263 --> 00:19:23,462
You monstrous witch.
Merry Christmas to you, too.

343
00:19:23,463 --> 00:19:26,542
Why are we spared?
What do you need us for?

344
00:19:26,543 --> 00:19:28,062
Your children.

345
00:19:28,063 --> 00:19:32,262
What makes that scene nightmarish
is that it's not the snow,

346
00:19:32,263 --> 00:19:35,302
and it's not the Cybermen, not the
people screaming and running about,

347
00:19:35,303 --> 00:19:37,222
it's the fact that The Doctor
isn't there.

348
00:19:37,223 --> 00:19:39,342
That makes it without hope,
that scene.

349
00:19:39,343 --> 00:19:42,062
There's something
really remorseless and awful.

350
00:19:42,063 --> 00:19:43,982
At the same time we've
got a woman there

351
00:19:43,983 --> 00:19:45,502
in a red dress with a parasol.

352
00:19:45,503 --> 00:19:47,142
There's a bit of colour in there.

353
00:19:47,143 --> 00:19:49,342
It was very dramatic

354
00:19:49,343 --> 00:19:54,902
and it will be a very funny,
powerful and scary scene.

355
00:19:54,903 --> 00:19:56,022
It's magnificent.

356
00:19:56,023 --> 00:19:59,582
I remember when the rushes came in
and it just looked extraordinary.

357
00:19:59,583 --> 00:20:02,942
It's funny now I think of it,
but in all these years

358
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:05,223
not one of you has
asked my first name.

359
00:20:07,343 --> 00:20:08,942
It's Mercy.

360
00:20:08,943 --> 00:20:10,862
Dervla is somebody we've
talked about a lot

361
00:20:10,863 --> 00:20:13,142
and who we really wanted
to find the right part for.

362
00:20:13,143 --> 00:20:14,822
Your work is done.

363
00:20:14,823 --> 00:20:17,422
She's got the red dress,
she's in charge of the Cybermen.

364
00:20:17,423 --> 00:20:19,822
Delete them. Delete.

365
00:20:19,823 --> 00:20:21,862
You could get too big for that part,

366
00:20:21,863 --> 00:20:24,862
you want a proper, proper actor who
will take it seriously.

367
00:20:24,863 --> 00:20:28,582
Those velvety tones that she has
worked so well for Miss Hartigan.

368
00:20:28,583 --> 00:20:33,062
She kind of wheels you in and
then spits you out the other side.

369
00:20:33,063 --> 00:20:34,622
Thank you, Doctor.

370
00:20:34,623 --> 00:20:38,462
Dervla is so beautiful and
we could just see her in that dress.

371
00:20:38,463 --> 00:20:42,662
I know I'm here, but
I can't believe that I am,

372
00:20:42,663 --> 00:20:44,782
so it's great, it's really good.

373
00:20:44,783 --> 00:20:47,142
A fairly immaculate piece
of casting, I think.

374
00:20:47,143 --> 00:20:48,863
And she wears a red dress very well.

375
00:20:50,703 --> 00:20:52,823
Oh, that is magnificent!

376
00:20:55,423 --> 00:20:57,423
I think the Cybermen are terrifying.

377
00:20:59,183 --> 00:21:00,422
Report.

378
00:21:00,423 --> 00:21:03,422
There's something so
impenetrable about them.

379
00:21:03,423 --> 00:21:05,382
You can't do this to me.

380
00:21:05,383 --> 00:21:07,382
Incorrect, it is done.

381
00:21:07,383 --> 00:21:11,622
That sense of there's
nothing to appeal to.

382
00:21:11,623 --> 00:21:13,462
They're such a great monster.

383
00:21:13,463 --> 00:21:15,062
Visually and emotionally.

384
00:21:15,063 --> 00:21:16,862
Come on, Doctor!

385
00:21:16,863 --> 00:21:19,782
They're on a level
pegging with the Daleks.

386
00:21:19,783 --> 00:21:21,302
They look...

387
00:21:21,303 --> 00:21:23,862
amazingly scary in their movements

388
00:21:23,863 --> 00:21:29,382
and just the whole sheen of
them is quite horrible.

389
00:21:29,383 --> 00:21:32,582
They're pretty scary creatures.

390
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:35,262
You can't really see what's
going on behind their eyes.

391
00:21:35,263 --> 00:21:40,223
They're robots and monsters and they
are metal and they show no emotion.

392
00:21:41,423 --> 00:21:43,143
I think the word
iconic is over-used.

393
00:21:44,343 --> 00:21:47,383
But I think that
just about merits it.

394
00:21:51,663 --> 00:21:53,302
I know why they fit the snow.

395
00:21:53,303 --> 00:21:55,262
It's an image that's
lodged in my head.

396
00:21:55,263 --> 00:21:56,302
In the first Cyberman story,

397
00:21:56,303 --> 00:21:58,182
they appeared out of the
snow in The Tenth Planet.

398
00:21:58,183 --> 00:22:01,382
They were first seen marching
out of a snow blizzard.

399
00:22:01,383 --> 00:22:05,103
It's right and proper that they
should be doing that again in 2008.

400
00:22:06,663 --> 00:22:09,462
They attack the North Pole, which was
the first time we saw Cybermen.

401
00:22:09,463 --> 00:22:13,222
I remember watching that story.
I know I look impossibly young!

402
00:22:13,223 --> 00:22:15,742
ROBOTIC VOICE:
We are called Cybermen.

403
00:22:15,743 --> 00:22:18,382
Cybermen? Yes, Cybermen.

404
00:22:18,383 --> 00:22:21,422
The original Cybermen in the
'60s come from fears that people

405
00:22:21,423 --> 00:22:25,422
had about transplant surgery,
heart transplants were new then.

406
00:22:25,423 --> 00:22:27,982
People feared that having
a bionic arm

407
00:22:27,983 --> 00:22:30,222
would make you have a bionic brain.

408
00:22:30,223 --> 00:22:31,822
It was real body horror

409
00:22:31,823 --> 00:22:35,782
and modern science fetishes and
fear coming out there.

410
00:22:35,783 --> 00:22:41,422
Our lifespan was getting shorter
so our scientists and doctors

411
00:22:41,423 --> 00:22:45,262
devised spare parts for
our bodies until we could be

412
00:22:45,263 --> 00:22:47,462
almost completely replaced.

413
00:22:47,463 --> 00:22:50,382
If they were just robots,
I think they'd be a bit dull.

414
00:22:50,383 --> 00:22:52,422
But the fact that they were human,

415
00:22:52,423 --> 00:22:54,702
that they wanted to
make you like them.

416
00:22:54,703 --> 00:22:59,382
Come to Mondas and you will
have no need of emotions.

417
00:22:59,383 --> 00:23:01,902
You will become like us.

418
00:23:01,903 --> 00:23:05,302
They were machines in some way,
but they were human,

419
00:23:05,303 --> 00:23:10,142
but it's like there's nothing
that you can appeal to

420
00:23:10,143 --> 00:23:13,142
or bargain with or reason with.

421
00:23:13,143 --> 00:23:16,302
We need your power.

422
00:23:16,303 --> 00:23:19,222
You need our mass intelligence.

423
00:23:19,223 --> 00:23:21,263
Are you listening?

424
00:23:22,303 --> 00:23:23,942
Do you understand me?

425
00:23:23,943 --> 00:23:27,582
Now that I've released you...
Aaagh!

426
00:23:27,583 --> 00:23:28,942
Let me go.

427
00:23:28,943 --> 00:23:32,503
I set you free! It was our plan.

428
00:23:34,263 --> 00:23:37,622
You belong to us.

429
00:23:37,623 --> 00:23:39,742
I remember watching
Tomb Of The Cybermen.

430
00:23:39,743 --> 00:23:41,262
Look!

431
00:23:41,263 --> 00:23:43,062
They wake up in tombs.

432
00:23:43,063 --> 00:23:44,582
I was terrified.

433
00:23:44,583 --> 00:23:47,862
Actually, the bit
I genuinely remember,

434
00:23:47,863 --> 00:23:51,262
hiding by the arm of the settee,
literally,

435
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:54,942
was when they wake up
the Cyber Controller.

436
00:23:54,943 --> 00:23:57,022
They opened his door and out he steps

437
00:23:57,023 --> 00:24:00,222
and he's got a flesh-like brain on
top of his head.

438
00:24:00,223 --> 00:24:03,062
YOU BELONG TO US.

439
00:24:03,063 --> 00:24:05,782
I've always tried to keep
that as part of the design,

440
00:24:05,783 --> 00:24:08,782
because I remember being
stormingly terrified by it.

441
00:24:08,783 --> 00:24:11,942
My brain fleeing out of my head,
it was just so frightening.

442
00:24:11,943 --> 00:24:13,183
ROBOTIC BEEPING

443
00:24:14,543 --> 00:24:16,222
Cybermen. Sshhh!

444
00:24:16,223 --> 00:24:17,822
Where do they come from?

445
00:24:17,823 --> 00:24:20,622
I don't know, Jamie,
but they are here, aren't they?

446
00:24:20,623 --> 00:24:24,942
The invasion and the pods
and they cut their way through

447
00:24:24,943 --> 00:24:27,422
and they were born out of eggs.

448
00:24:27,423 --> 00:24:30,543
That sense of being born was
often there in the old ones.

449
00:24:32,343 --> 00:24:34,062
There's a Peter Davidson story

450
00:24:34,063 --> 00:24:36,942
called Earth Shock
where the Cybermen haven't been

451
00:24:36,943 --> 00:24:40,342
seen for years and they made this
huge return with a huge redesign.

452
00:24:40,343 --> 00:24:44,062
So...we meet again, Doctor.

453
00:24:44,063 --> 00:24:48,022
In that they're wrapped in
cellophane and inside these tubes.

454
00:24:48,023 --> 00:24:52,382
They force their way out
of the cellophane and metal tubes.

455
00:24:52,383 --> 00:24:54,462
It's a great big return,

456
00:24:54,463 --> 00:24:56,503
"We're back," and they start
to march en masse.

457
00:24:57,743 --> 00:25:01,383
It's terrifying, really,
so they're a great creation.

458
00:25:06,463 --> 00:25:08,423
Cybermen!

459
00:25:17,103 --> 00:25:22,623
Emotion - love, pride, hate,
fear... Have you no emotion, sir?

460
00:25:25,823 --> 00:25:29,343
YOU SHALL BE LIKE US.

461
00:25:33,663 --> 00:25:36,382
You've no home planet,
no influence, nothing!

462
00:25:36,383 --> 00:25:39,542
You never change,
always the perfect guests.

463
00:25:39,543 --> 00:25:41,582
You're a pathetic bunch
of tin soldiers

464
00:25:41,583 --> 00:25:45,063
stomping about the
galaxy in an ancient spaceship.

465
00:25:46,423 --> 00:25:50,543
But don't you care!?
CARE? NO, WHY SHOULD I CARE?

466
00:25:51,583 --> 00:25:53,222
Emotions have their uses.

467
00:25:53,223 --> 00:25:57,422
"FEEL-INGS", I DO NOT
UNDER-STAND THAT WORD.

468
00:25:57,423 --> 00:26:00,582
When did you last smell a flower,
watch a sunset?

469
00:26:00,583 --> 00:26:02,302
Good afternoon.

470
00:26:02,303 --> 00:26:05,022
These things are irrelevant.

471
00:26:05,023 --> 00:26:08,543
For some people, small, beautiful
events is what life is all about.

472
00:26:12,503 --> 00:26:16,783
WE KNOW OF YOUR INTELLIGENCE.
Oh, thank you very much(!)

473
00:26:22,143 --> 00:26:24,422
EXPLODE THE BOMB.

474
00:26:24,423 --> 00:26:25,743
EXPLOSION

475
00:26:28,703 --> 00:26:31,143
The Doctor is a formidable opponent.

476
00:26:37,823 --> 00:26:41,023
WE WILL SURVIVE.

477
00:26:52,143 --> 00:26:54,462
Run, Doctor! Now, Doctor!

478
00:26:54,463 --> 00:26:58,422
But for now, let's leave the cyber
attack in Christmas present

479
00:26:58,423 --> 00:27:00,343
and take a look
at Christmas past.

480
00:27:09,943 --> 00:27:11,782
I think the Christmas invasion's

481
00:27:11,783 --> 00:27:14,102
always going to have
a big place in my heart

482
00:27:14,103 --> 00:27:17,463
because of David Tennant
stepping out of the TARDIS.

483
00:27:19,223 --> 00:27:23,423
Here we are then, London, Earth,
the solar system. Look at it!

484
00:27:25,343 --> 00:27:28,342
The Christmas invasion is still one
of my probably top five

485
00:27:28,343 --> 00:27:30,542
favourite episodes
that I've done, I think.

486
00:27:30,543 --> 00:27:33,942
Rose! Rose! I've got you.

487
00:27:33,943 --> 00:27:36,542
My Lord, my precious thing.

488
00:27:36,543 --> 00:27:40,702
The Doctor, is he with you? No.

489
00:27:40,703 --> 00:27:44,142
We're on our own.

490
00:27:44,143 --> 00:27:47,902
Everyone is gathered and the whole
Earth is going to be doomed.

491
00:27:47,903 --> 00:27:49,782
IT SNARLS

492
00:27:49,783 --> 00:27:52,542
Now you're going to die.
Leave her alone! Don't touch her!

493
00:27:52,543 --> 00:27:54,222
Just that sense that all is lost,

494
00:27:54,223 --> 00:27:59,542
that we can't even tell what
the aliens are saying any more.

495
00:27:59,543 --> 00:28:01,702
And then slowly,
almost imperceptibly,

496
00:28:01,703 --> 00:28:03,782
the leader starts speaking
in English.

497
00:28:03,783 --> 00:28:07,902
Then your world will be gutted...
Then your world will be gutted

498
00:28:07,903 --> 00:28:12,302
..and your people enslaved...
..and your people enslaved.

499
00:28:12,303 --> 00:28:13,902
Hold on, that's English.

500
00:28:13,903 --> 00:28:17,622
And therefore, if you can understand
what he says, then that means

501
00:28:17,623 --> 00:28:21,142
the TARDIS translation circuits
are working again, and that means

502
00:28:21,143 --> 00:28:22,542
that The Doctor's woken up

503
00:28:22,543 --> 00:28:25,383
and that means that there might
just be a hope after all.

504
00:28:28,343 --> 00:28:30,222
And then the camera zooms in,

505
00:28:30,223 --> 00:28:33,902
the doors open and there's
David Tennant in his pyjamas.

506
00:28:33,903 --> 00:28:35,222
Did you miss me?

507
00:28:35,223 --> 00:28:37,183
It was a whole new
era of the programme.

508
00:28:44,503 --> 00:28:47,862
My favourite bit of The Runaway
Bride is that bit on the motorway,

509
00:28:47,863 --> 00:28:50,463
when the TARDIS
bounces down the road.

510
00:28:57,743 --> 00:29:00,102
You are kidding me.

511
00:29:00,103 --> 00:29:03,662
It's something I've always wanted
to see, ever since I was a child.

512
00:29:03,663 --> 00:29:07,262
I sat in the car and imagined
the TARDIS flying alongside.

513
00:29:07,263 --> 00:29:08,902
When you get to put that on screen

514
00:29:08,903 --> 00:29:11,982
with Catherine Tate in a wedding
dress being watched by two kids

515
00:29:11,983 --> 00:29:13,702
in the car in front, and David being

516
00:29:13,703 --> 00:29:16,663
his most heroic, and the TARDIS
being its most heroic.

517
00:29:19,463 --> 00:29:21,742
It's pretty hard to beat, really.

518
00:29:21,743 --> 00:29:23,263
Oh!

519
00:29:29,583 --> 00:29:33,423
And then, of course, there's the old
Christmas special from last year.

520
00:29:40,143 --> 00:29:43,743
It ends with a replica Titanic
plunging towards Buckingham Palace.

521
00:29:47,063 --> 00:29:49,662
And I don't think you can
get more Doctor Who than that.

522
00:29:49,663 --> 00:29:50,623
That's just barmy.

523
00:29:52,183 --> 00:29:54,342
Could you get me Buckingham Palace?

524
00:29:54,343 --> 00:29:57,182
Only in Dr Who could you get
something that mad

525
00:29:57,183 --> 00:29:59,342
and that heroic and that much fun.

526
00:29:59,343 --> 00:30:02,902
And the Queen waving as it sails over
Buckingham Palace. That's Dr Who.

527
00:30:02,903 --> 00:30:05,502
Bring in the Time Lord.

528
00:30:05,503 --> 00:30:09,062
And being the nation's favourite
Time Lord brings with it a whole

529
00:30:09,063 --> 00:30:13,383
history of comic sketches, all
there to pay homage to The Doctor.

530
00:30:15,023 --> 00:30:18,462
My old favourite, I don't know if
it still exists in the archive,

531
00:30:18,463 --> 00:30:20,862
Crackerjack would do little
Dr Who sketches

532
00:30:20,863 --> 00:30:22,462
and sort of pantos and things.

533
00:30:22,463 --> 00:30:24,862
Dr Who! Don't forget the jewels.

534
00:30:24,863 --> 00:30:26,062
APPLAUSE

535
00:30:26,063 --> 00:30:28,022
All these jewels are ours!

536
00:30:28,023 --> 00:30:30,262
I used to love it. As a Dr Who fan,
you'd sit up

537
00:30:30,263 --> 00:30:33,782
cos it was your favourite show being
referenced. I loved it.

538
00:30:33,783 --> 00:30:34,862
EERIE BLARING

539
00:30:34,863 --> 00:30:37,302
Oh dear, what a funny noise
you're making!

540
00:30:37,303 --> 00:30:39,502
You've been bolting your food again.

541
00:30:39,503 --> 00:30:40,983
Good heavens, what is that?

542
00:30:42,783 --> 00:30:45,902
It's a giant-sized money
box for putting coppers in.

543
00:30:45,903 --> 00:30:48,262
Things like that would
crop up all the time,

544
00:30:48,263 --> 00:30:49,862
like Emu's Pink Windmill show

545
00:30:49,863 --> 00:30:52,342
did Dr Emu.

546
00:30:52,343 --> 00:30:54,143
They did daft little sketches.

547
00:31:05,063 --> 00:31:06,702
And later on, all those people

548
00:31:06,703 --> 00:31:09,183
who did big formal sketches,
like Lenny Henry.

549
00:31:16,623 --> 00:31:19,582
Doctor, what happened,
what happened? What's going on?

550
00:31:19,583 --> 00:31:21,662
Doctor, where are you?
What happened?

551
00:31:21,663 --> 00:31:23,702
Doctor? Doctor...

552
00:31:23,703 --> 00:31:26,102
Doctor, what's happened to you?

553
00:31:26,103 --> 00:31:27,782
You're different! Doctor!

554
00:31:27,783 --> 00:31:30,622
Doctor, what's happening?
Doctor, what...?

555
00:31:30,623 --> 00:31:32,622
Penny? What? Shut up.

556
00:31:32,623 --> 00:31:34,742
I used to think it was a compliment,

557
00:31:34,743 --> 00:31:38,302
even though they are clearly taking
the mickey out of Dr Who,

558
00:31:38,303 --> 00:31:39,982
but that's part of the fun of it.

559
00:31:39,983 --> 00:31:43,662
So do Dr Who fans. It was like lots
of people were in on the game.

560
00:31:43,663 --> 00:31:46,902
Because all the work is now
being done by robots.

561
00:31:46,903 --> 00:31:51,862
You mean? The Daleks?
No, not them, the Cybermen.

562
00:31:51,863 --> 00:31:52,982
Ah!

563
00:31:52,983 --> 00:31:56,302
There's only one thing to do now,
but I can't remember what it is.

564
00:31:56,303 --> 00:31:59,342
Run up and down lot of corridors!
That was the one.

565
00:31:59,343 --> 00:32:01,342
There is, I don't know
if you've got...

566
00:32:01,343 --> 00:32:04,622
There's a French and Saunders
sketch that was never transmitted.

567
00:32:04,623 --> 00:32:06,342
Welcome, Time Lord.

568
00:32:06,343 --> 00:32:11,782
I must protest, questioner.
All in good time, Time...Lord.

569
00:32:11,783 --> 00:32:15,262
I think it's on the Trial Of
The Time Lord set, larking about.

570
00:32:15,263 --> 00:32:18,262
Now, we are on Syluria, aren't we?
Yes, we are.

571
00:32:18,263 --> 00:32:20,622
And you know how we know that? How?

572
00:32:20,623 --> 00:32:23,262
Because we're Sylurians.
Yes. I know.

573
00:32:23,263 --> 00:32:25,622
I have the seeds
of Agron in my possession.

574
00:32:25,623 --> 00:32:27,822
He's very good, isn't he?

575
00:32:27,823 --> 00:32:29,822
Tom Baker's my favourite, really.

576
00:32:29,823 --> 00:32:33,222
Yes, yes, I like
Patrick Lichfield the best.

577
00:32:33,223 --> 00:32:36,862
Two Ronnies, I remember vividly,
there's a sketch in The Two Ronnies.

578
00:32:36,863 --> 00:32:39,903
It's one of their big song-and-dance
sketches at the end.

579
00:32:52,663 --> 00:32:55,502
Gor, it's a bit of a mix up.
Who are you supposed to be?

580
00:32:55,503 --> 00:32:58,542
I be Dr Who, that's who I be.
Who be you be?

581
00:32:58,543 --> 00:33:02,462
No, you used to be Dr Who,
now you're Worzel Gummidge.

582
00:33:02,463 --> 00:33:05,543
Oh, I must have got
the wrong head on.

583
00:33:07,263 --> 00:33:10,622
# Life can be terribly tame

584
00:33:10,623 --> 00:33:13,982
# If you don't play
the game with two.... #

585
00:33:13,983 --> 00:33:16,942
I remember an episode
of the Generation Game

586
00:33:16,943 --> 00:33:18,622
where Bruce
says "Bring on the dialects."

587
00:33:18,623 --> 00:33:22,142
Could we have the varied
dialects, please?

588
00:33:22,143 --> 00:33:25,143
This is a good game,
you'll really love this.

589
00:33:28,143 --> 00:33:29,742
I said "Dialects!"

590
00:33:29,743 --> 00:33:32,502
APPLAUSE

591
00:33:32,503 --> 00:33:35,942
For a Dalek to appear out of the
blue was the most exciting thing.

592
00:33:35,943 --> 00:33:38,262
A Dalek and Bruce Forsyth.
Marvellous!

593
00:33:38,263 --> 00:33:41,142
And the one I loved,

594
00:33:41,143 --> 00:33:45,022
the one everyone always went on
about in school for years, everyone,

595
00:33:45,023 --> 00:33:47,742
not just Dr Who fans,
was the Spike Milligan sketch.

596
00:33:47,743 --> 00:33:51,262
HEL-LO DAR-LING, I'M HOME!

597
00:33:51,263 --> 00:33:52,983
LAUGHTER

598
00:33:57,423 --> 00:34:00,063
You're late tonight.

599
00:34:01,503 --> 00:34:03,822
I'M SOR-RY I'M LATE.

600
00:34:03,823 --> 00:34:07,503
THE TUBES WERE FULL OF COM-MUTERS.

601
00:34:09,463 --> 00:34:11,462
How did you get on then?

602
00:34:11,463 --> 00:34:14,063
I EX-TER-MINA-TED THEM.

603
00:34:14,983 --> 00:34:16,622
It's got a little baby Dalek.

604
00:34:16,623 --> 00:34:20,222
Johnny, have you
finished your homework?

605
00:34:20,223 --> 00:34:23,062
YES, I HAVE DESTROYED IT.

606
00:34:23,063 --> 00:34:25,302
You used to be thrilled
when you saw that.

607
00:34:25,303 --> 00:34:27,262
Who is it, Doctor?

608
00:34:27,263 --> 00:34:29,982
I'm not very bright and I
haven't got my glasses on.

609
00:34:29,983 --> 00:34:31,982
It's my old enemy, Crayola.

610
00:34:31,983 --> 00:34:34,022
Hello, Crayola.

611
00:34:34,023 --> 00:34:39,222
Doctor, it's been a long time.
Eons. As long as that?

612
00:34:39,223 --> 00:34:42,062
You don't look a day over 5 million.

613
00:34:42,063 --> 00:34:44,502
How do you do it? Table tennis.

614
00:34:44,503 --> 00:34:45,982
HE LAUGHS

615
00:34:45,983 --> 00:34:48,462
We don't have much time.
I'll keep him talking,

616
00:34:48,463 --> 00:34:51,422
you creep behind him and disconnect
his blademite tubing.

617
00:34:51,423 --> 00:34:53,142
But we haven't got the ming mongs!

618
00:34:53,143 --> 00:34:55,662
I just love it.
It's like an extra bit of Dr Who.

619
00:34:55,663 --> 00:34:58,782
Even though they're not legitimate
Dr Who, you'd be chuffed

620
00:34:58,783 --> 00:35:01,982
for that night that someone
was referencing Dr Who.

621
00:35:01,983 --> 00:35:03,623
Here's a clip of The Who.

622
00:35:08,183 --> 00:35:10,662
# People try to put us down

623
00:35:10,663 --> 00:35:13,982
DR WHO THEME: # Dum di de dum
Dum di de dum di de dum di de

624
00:35:13,983 --> 00:35:16,062
# Just because we get around. #

625
00:35:16,063 --> 00:35:18,503
There's lot of stuff,
when you look for it.

626
00:35:20,983 --> 00:35:24,982
Cat Deely, alien. Chris Tarrant,
alien.

627
00:35:24,983 --> 00:35:27,502
The Queen. ALL: Alien!

628
00:35:27,503 --> 00:35:32,462
MUSIC: "Doctor Who Theme"

629
00:35:32,463 --> 00:35:34,502
Where does the transporter
arrive at?

630
00:35:34,503 --> 00:35:37,262
In France. France?

631
00:35:37,263 --> 00:35:40,822
France, Casterberus,
or France, Neptune?

632
00:35:40,823 --> 00:35:44,822
That would be France, French...
French land.

633
00:35:44,823 --> 00:35:45,823
Good.

634
00:35:47,583 --> 00:35:49,182
What are you doing here?

635
00:35:49,183 --> 00:35:51,102
I work here.

636
00:35:51,103 --> 00:35:53,142
You've been telling these people

637
00:35:53,143 --> 00:35:56,102
that you're the train guard,
but you're really the Master.

638
00:35:56,103 --> 00:35:59,582
You've been telling the humans that
they were going to the Eurotunnel,

639
00:35:59,583 --> 00:36:02,382
when you were taking them
into the vortex of the black hole.

640
00:36:02,383 --> 00:36:04,342
You're very naughty.

641
00:36:04,343 --> 00:36:07,822
I'm going to the bathroom and
then I'm dealing with you. OK.

642
00:36:07,823 --> 00:36:10,902
You got lots of these sketches,
which are taking the mickey

643
00:36:10,903 --> 00:36:14,062
out of Doctor Who, which is what
we do when we sit in the pub.

644
00:36:14,063 --> 00:36:16,982
But it all sort of built up to this
Comic Relief thing,

645
00:36:16,983 --> 00:36:20,062
written by Steven Moffat,
who you might have heard of,

646
00:36:20,063 --> 00:36:22,622
and it's a great big,
Comic Relief sketch

647
00:36:22,623 --> 00:36:24,302
called Curse of the Fatal Death.

648
00:36:24,303 --> 00:36:25,582
Exterminate!

649
00:36:25,583 --> 00:36:29,102
It's a beautiful piece of work, I
think, because it's having a laugh

650
00:36:29,103 --> 00:36:32,342
with Doctor Who. The Master's in it,
Jonathan Pryce is the Master.

651
00:36:32,343 --> 00:36:35,702
You are piloting your
TARDIS into a deadly trap.

652
00:36:35,703 --> 00:36:40,382
And even you will not suspect
until it's far too late.

653
00:36:40,383 --> 00:36:43,982
Nyaa-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

654
00:36:43,983 --> 00:36:46,942
If you're going to spy on me,
you should turn the speaker off.

655
00:36:46,943 --> 00:36:49,182
It's sending up The Doctor
and the companion.

656
00:36:49,183 --> 00:36:53,862
A girl more exciting than
an escape up a ventilation shaft,

657
00:36:53,863 --> 00:36:58,182
a lover more thrilling
than an army of Cybernetic slugs.

658
00:36:58,183 --> 00:37:02,542
Euw! There's lots of people been
marvellous as The Doctor.

659
00:37:02,543 --> 00:37:05,943
Cute,
sexy and lick-the-mirror handsome.

660
00:37:08,983 --> 00:37:10,022
Doctor?

661
00:37:10,023 --> 00:37:14,062
Ah, you're my fiancee, aren't you?

662
00:37:14,063 --> 00:37:16,182
Oh, dear.

663
00:37:16,183 --> 00:37:18,862
Seem to be a bit shy of girls now.

664
00:37:18,863 --> 00:37:22,422
You've come back to life and
this time, you're a woman.

665
00:37:22,423 --> 00:37:25,982
Really? I've always wanted to
get my hands on one of these.

666
00:37:25,983 --> 00:37:29,662
And it had, fleetingly, one of the
best Doctor Whos there's ever been,

667
00:37:29,663 --> 00:37:30,782
which is Hugh Grant.

668
00:37:30,783 --> 00:37:34,302
Oh dear, I've used up three whole
bodies in just under a minute,

669
00:37:34,303 --> 00:37:36,702
and all because
I forgot to unplug first.

670
00:37:36,703 --> 00:37:38,822
That really was
terribly silly of me.

671
00:37:38,823 --> 00:37:42,142
Sorry about that, my dear,
a bit unfortunate.

672
00:37:42,143 --> 00:37:45,262
Oh, Doctor. Oh, assistant.

673
00:37:45,263 --> 00:37:48,782
He's brilliant, he's absolutely
genuinely brilliant

674
00:37:48,783 --> 00:37:50,942
and I wish he'd be
a Doctor one day.

675
00:37:50,943 --> 00:37:53,022
Look after the universe for me.

676
00:37:53,023 --> 00:37:55,382
I've put a lot of work into it.

677
00:37:55,383 --> 00:37:59,142
Actually, it's in love
with Doctor Who and really, genuinely

678
00:37:59,143 --> 00:38:01,382
says beautiful Doctor Who things
in it.

679
00:38:01,383 --> 00:38:04,422
And you can see Steven's
love of Doctor Who coming out.

680
00:38:04,423 --> 00:38:09,222
You're like Father Christmas,
the Wizard of Oz, Scooby-Doo,

681
00:38:09,223 --> 00:38:15,542
and I love you very much, and we all
need you and you simply cannot die!

682
00:38:15,543 --> 00:38:17,862
Before Donna Noble came on the TARDIS
full time,

683
00:38:17,863 --> 00:38:20,742
you had Catherine Tate doing sketches
with David Tennant.

684
00:38:20,743 --> 00:38:23,142
Is your name
Lauren Cooper by any chance?

685
00:38:23,143 --> 00:38:25,422
Yeah.

686
00:38:25,423 --> 00:38:28,942
Why? Your reputation precedes you.

687
00:38:28,943 --> 00:38:31,342
Innit though.

688
00:38:31,343 --> 00:38:34,142
He appears in the sketch
as a teacher. Can I ask a question?

689
00:38:34,143 --> 00:38:35,942
Not just now. Can I ask a question?

690
00:38:35,943 --> 00:38:38,262
Just wait.
But can I just ask you a question?

691
00:38:38,263 --> 00:38:41,582
Can't I ask you a question?
I'm just asking you a question.

692
00:38:41,583 --> 00:38:44,142
Can't I ask you a QUESTION?

693
00:38:44,143 --> 00:38:46,662
What is it?

694
00:38:46,663 --> 00:38:49,982
Are you The Doctor?

695
00:38:49,983 --> 00:38:54,022
I like it when Doctor Who's involved
in this stuff. We actually enjoy it

696
00:38:54,023 --> 00:38:56,982
and try to help as much we can,
because the more Doctor Who

697
00:38:56,983 --> 00:38:59,342
in any shape or form
we get on the screen,

698
00:38:59,343 --> 00:39:00,542
the better.

699
00:39:00,543 --> 00:39:01,782
The plot thickens

700
00:39:01,783 --> 00:39:05,022
and The Doctor,
Jackson and Rosita find themselves

701
00:39:05,023 --> 00:39:08,223
at the hub of all the action.

702
00:39:12,783 --> 00:39:15,503
Upon my soul...
What is it? It's an engine.

703
00:39:20,863 --> 00:39:23,422
I wonder if anyone'll recognise
The Hub

704
00:39:23,423 --> 00:39:25,502
before they watch Doctor Who
Confidential

705
00:39:25,503 --> 00:39:27,382
and realise
that's what we filmed on?

706
00:39:27,383 --> 00:39:29,862
I'd imagined it'd be a location
first of all,

707
00:39:29,863 --> 00:39:33,222
that we'd find an old Cardiff
warehouse. When you think of it,

708
00:39:33,223 --> 00:39:35,742
it's got so much design in it,
it's got CGI in it,

709
00:39:35,743 --> 00:39:37,302
and it's got kids running about,

710
00:39:37,303 --> 00:39:40,062
a lot of health and safety
issues and stuff like that.

711
00:39:40,063 --> 00:39:41,622
Because Torchwood

712
00:39:41,623 --> 00:39:44,902
were not filming at the time
that we were filming this story,

713
00:39:44,903 --> 00:39:46,902
we basically rebuilt it.

714
00:39:46,903 --> 00:39:49,022
I did sit there at the meeting going,

715
00:39:49,023 --> 00:39:52,302
"As long as you can turn it back
to the original Hub."

716
00:39:52,303 --> 00:39:56,262
In terms of scale and dimensions,
it offered everything we needed.

717
00:39:56,263 --> 00:39:59,342
The shape's still here but, other
than that, it's unrecognisable.

718
00:39:59,343 --> 00:40:01,702
Behind us is Captain Jack's office,

719
00:40:01,703 --> 00:40:03,902
his lovely round window
is now a ser-tunnel.

720
00:40:03,903 --> 00:40:06,222
It was unusual for me
cos I've done Torchwood,

721
00:40:06,223 --> 00:40:08,702
so it was strange
stepping onto that set.

722
00:40:08,703 --> 00:40:10,902
It really was unrecognisable
actually

723
00:40:10,903 --> 00:40:13,302
and I thought it was fantastic
what they did.

724
00:40:13,303 --> 00:40:16,702
You've got to have a sharp eye to
spot it as the same place.

725
00:40:16,703 --> 00:40:19,502
I don't think I'd have recognised
it. It was brilliantly done.

726
00:40:19,503 --> 00:40:22,582
So all that's left it to do
is set the cogs in motion

727
00:40:22,583 --> 00:40:24,822
and fill the place
with over-excited kids.

728
00:40:24,823 --> 00:40:28,102
They do say you should
never work with kids.

729
00:40:28,103 --> 00:40:30,902
Children! Pay attention!

730
00:40:30,903 --> 00:40:33,742
# It's a hard-knock life, hard life

731
00:40:33,743 --> 00:40:36,743
# It's a hard-knock life for us

732
00:40:38,023 --> 00:40:39,422
# Steada treated we get tricked

733
00:40:39,423 --> 00:40:43,022
# Steada kisses we get kicked

734
00:40:43,023 --> 00:40:45,222
# It's a hard-knock life. #

735
00:40:45,223 --> 00:40:46,542
I've spent many years

736
00:40:46,543 --> 00:40:47,822
on set working with kids

737
00:40:47,823 --> 00:40:50,622
and I've always found them
a very receptive audience.

738
00:40:50,623 --> 00:40:52,702
Shelley and Amy,
you stay there for me.

739
00:40:52,703 --> 00:40:56,302
My AD Richard Harris, he was fab.
I workshop with him actually.

740
00:40:56,303 --> 00:41:00,022
When she says that,
pull this lever with two hands.

741
00:41:00,023 --> 00:41:03,422
Pull it back
and everything's going to begin.

742
00:41:03,423 --> 00:41:06,102
We had to hit the ground running
and get a step ahead.

743
00:41:06,103 --> 00:41:08,662
This is the first time
they've seen the set,

744
00:41:08,663 --> 00:41:11,142
and they've found their feet
so they've done well.

745
00:41:11,143 --> 00:41:13,462
Max, go down there, mate.

746
00:41:13,463 --> 00:41:16,382
Thank you very much.
You're gonna help John,

747
00:41:16,383 --> 00:41:19,422
so take a handle each... Not too
close to the edge, mate.

748
00:41:19,423 --> 00:41:22,502
Take a handle each. Up there, John.
Ready, Max?

749
00:41:22,503 --> 00:41:25,982
Come on, John. We can do this! And
turn it clockwise. Are you ready?

750
00:41:25,983 --> 00:41:28,023
Is anyone listening? Anyone?

751
00:41:28,223 --> 00:41:30,102
Anyone? All right, here we go. Ready?

752
00:41:30,103 --> 00:41:33,342
He's like the Pied Piper, he's
brilliant. He remembers their names

753
00:41:33,343 --> 00:41:35,942
and bonds with them. They
really respond well to him.

754
00:41:35,943 --> 00:41:38,422
So, all face...
All face that way, please.

755
00:41:38,423 --> 00:41:42,022
Turn round, and can you go round
the other side of that handle?

756
00:41:42,023 --> 00:41:44,462
And if you go just one behind...
Watch your back.

757
00:41:44,463 --> 00:41:46,902
Well done.
So I'll count to three, OK?

758
00:41:46,903 --> 00:41:48,982
Then we start walking round, OK?

759
00:41:48,983 --> 00:41:52,702
Here we go. One, two, three. Good.

760
00:41:52,703 --> 00:41:55,023
Not too fast. Slow down.

761
00:41:57,663 --> 00:42:01,102
Brilliant. Well done, fellas.
So, Jack,

762
00:42:01,103 --> 00:42:04,982
you look after the speed
of that, all right? Not too quick.

763
00:42:04,983 --> 00:42:07,622
And you need to be
leaning, all right?

764
00:42:07,623 --> 00:42:11,342
He knows how to deal with them, so I
felt in very safe hands with him.

765
00:42:11,343 --> 00:42:13,702
And we're gonna put in lots of
extra effort,

766
00:42:13,703 --> 00:42:16,222
so you're gonna be going
fast with that, Jack.

767
00:42:16,223 --> 00:42:19,782
We'll shovel twice as hard. You're
gonna be pulling this down

768
00:42:19,783 --> 00:42:21,943
as fast as you can.

769
00:42:24,423 --> 00:42:27,382
Yeah, I enjoyed working with them.
The kids were fantastic.

770
00:42:27,383 --> 00:42:28,742
B camera.

771
00:42:28,743 --> 00:42:29,743
Action.

772
00:42:30,663 --> 00:42:34,702
Children! Pay attention.

773
00:42:34,703 --> 00:42:37,542
Now, let the new
industrial revolution begin.

774
00:42:37,543 --> 00:42:39,062
I want to see you work!

775
00:42:39,063 --> 00:42:40,743
Go.

776
00:43:06,103 --> 00:43:08,142
Thank you very much. Cut there.

777
00:43:08,143 --> 00:43:10,382
OK, testing. One.

778
00:43:10,383 --> 00:43:11,862
We've just been filming

779
00:43:11,863 --> 00:43:16,583
a scene which involved a lot of
stunts and pyrotechnics and stuff.

780
00:43:17,703 --> 00:43:20,342
My son?

781
00:43:20,343 --> 00:43:22,702
Doctor, my son! What?

782
00:43:22,703 --> 00:43:24,302
They took my son! No wonder

783
00:43:24,303 --> 00:43:27,742
I can't escape those damned
Cybermen! They took my child!

784
00:43:27,743 --> 00:43:29,783
Action.

785
00:43:30,863 --> 00:43:33,742
Sorry. That's all right,
it's our fault. Sorry, mate.

786
00:43:33,743 --> 00:43:35,343
That was real fun to do.

787
00:43:37,703 --> 00:43:39,942
15, and action. What are we gonna
do, Doctor? What are we gonna do?

788
00:43:39,943 --> 00:43:42,383
Come on, Jackson.

789
00:43:44,103 --> 00:43:45,583
You know me.

790
00:43:48,663 --> 00:43:50,022
They're really full on

791
00:43:50,023 --> 00:43:51,863
Indiana Jones hero scenes.

792
00:43:53,903 --> 00:43:56,102
Oh, that's it! Hello!

793
00:43:56,103 --> 00:43:59,062
Like any of our big set pieces,
everything's planned,

794
00:43:59,063 --> 00:44:01,262
planned, planned
and we break it down.

795
00:44:01,263 --> 00:44:03,382
Action. Both Davids were
really up for it

796
00:44:03,383 --> 00:44:05,422
and Tom Langford,
who was our little boy,

797
00:44:05,423 --> 00:44:07,742
Frederick,
was really brave and great.

798
00:44:07,743 --> 00:44:12,303
I love, love going on the wires
but I hate heights.

799
00:44:13,543 --> 00:44:15,302
I'm Frederick.

800
00:44:15,303 --> 00:44:17,262
I'm, like, Frederick.

801
00:44:17,263 --> 00:44:19,982
I don't know how old I am.

802
00:44:19,983 --> 00:44:23,342
Um... But in real life I'm eight,

803
00:44:23,343 --> 00:44:26,662
but in this I'm about five, I think.

804
00:44:26,663 --> 00:44:28,702
Action.

805
00:44:28,703 --> 00:44:31,862
I've been doing some
scenes with Dave Tennant.

806
00:44:31,863 --> 00:44:34,702
I've been doing loads of
scenes with David Morrissey.

807
00:44:34,703 --> 00:44:36,262
Thank you, gents.

808
00:44:36,263 --> 00:44:38,662
Blue-eyed Frederick. He was lovely.

809
00:44:38,663 --> 00:44:41,982
What was wonderful about him
was, when we were cutting it,

810
00:44:41,983 --> 00:44:43,942
his reactions to all the explosions

811
00:44:43,943 --> 00:44:46,342
were just really spot on,
and he was lovely.

812
00:44:46,343 --> 00:44:50,262
He's the best child actor
I've ever seen. Big eyes! Fantastic.

813
00:44:50,263 --> 00:44:53,862
He just had this kind of
cherubic quality that I think

814
00:44:53,863 --> 00:44:57,182
you associate with these kind of,
you know, Victorian stories.

815
00:44:57,183 --> 00:45:00,742
Hello! Now, hold on tight, don't
let go. 'There was more wirework'

816
00:45:00,743 --> 00:45:04,182
for rescuing young Frederick. Again,
that's one of those scenes,

817
00:45:04,183 --> 00:45:06,062
because The Hub set is quite tall,

818
00:45:06,063 --> 00:45:10,942
and therefore the set that we had
for the Cyberbase was quite tall

819
00:45:10,943 --> 00:45:13,142
and had three or four
different levels.

820
00:45:13,143 --> 00:45:16,462
Little Tom who played Frederick
had to be wired to me.

821
00:45:16,463 --> 00:45:21,902
I had a sort of... This rig
round, all round me, quite a big rig,

822
00:45:21,903 --> 00:45:25,502
which was then wired through the
front of my shirt onto the rope.

823
00:45:25,503 --> 00:45:29,342
And then little Tom
was attached to my back

824
00:45:29,343 --> 00:45:32,143
so that, if we fell,
we were going down together.

825
00:45:37,583 --> 00:45:39,422
Russell's got a thing
about up and down.

826
00:45:39,423 --> 00:45:41,142
Perhaps if you could pull. I am!

827
00:45:41,143 --> 00:45:43,622
In this position
I couldn't not pull, could I?

828
00:45:43,623 --> 00:45:47,022
He believes that up and down is
more exciting than left to right.

829
00:45:47,023 --> 00:45:48,942
He's probably right. He usually is.

830
00:45:48,943 --> 00:45:50,662
I just love them somehow. I think

831
00:45:50,663 --> 00:45:53,702
they're more exciting.
Most stuff goes from right to left.

832
00:45:53,703 --> 00:45:56,742
Life goes right to left,
and chases tend to go

833
00:45:56,743 --> 00:45:59,142
right to left
on screen and things like that.

834
00:45:59,143 --> 00:46:00,982
When we take a sort of deep breath,

835
00:46:00,983 --> 00:46:03,342
it's more thrilling.
We're all afraid of heights.

836
00:46:03,343 --> 00:46:07,662
Woah! Gotcha.

837
00:46:07,663 --> 00:46:10,502
When we take a chase
and have it going up and down,

838
00:46:10,503 --> 00:46:13,062
then it
becomes really, really exciting,

839
00:46:13,063 --> 00:46:16,142
and, you know,
everyone fears a drop behind them.

840
00:46:16,143 --> 00:46:19,582
He's always finding different ways to
send the characters up and down,

841
00:46:19,583 --> 00:46:23,223
which usually means we're on wires,
like the lift shaft in New Earth.

842
00:46:25,103 --> 00:46:26,862
You're completely mad!

843
00:46:26,863 --> 00:46:30,142
I can see why she likes you.
Going down!

844
00:46:30,143 --> 00:46:31,222
THEY SCREAM

845
00:46:31,223 --> 00:46:34,902
One of my favourite sequences - Rose
and The Doctor whizzing up and down.

846
00:46:34,903 --> 00:46:37,942
That whole story actually
goes up and down the hospital,

847
00:46:37,943 --> 00:46:40,823
all the time, but ends classically
in that slide down.

848
00:46:48,063 --> 00:46:50,462
Well, that's one way to lose weight.

849
00:46:50,463 --> 00:46:52,662
It's a bit of a motif
in Russell's scripts

850
00:46:52,663 --> 00:46:54,342
that the characters will be...

851
00:46:54,343 --> 00:46:58,062
will be on the vertical
as much as possible.

852
00:46:58,063 --> 00:47:01,662
You've got to be kidding!
Rose, get up!

853
00:47:01,663 --> 00:47:04,622
Our very first Cyberman story
has an escape

854
00:47:04,623 --> 00:47:06,622
up a rope ladder

855
00:47:06,623 --> 00:47:07,862
flying from a zeppelin

856
00:47:07,863 --> 00:47:11,182
above an exploding factory with
the Cyber Controller after you.

857
00:47:11,183 --> 00:47:13,022
It doesn't get much more vertical!

858
00:47:13,023 --> 00:47:15,182
It was people
hanging on for dear lives,

859
00:47:15,183 --> 00:47:17,543
and a Cyber Controller
pulling them down.

860
00:47:23,663 --> 00:47:25,862
It wouldn't have been as exciting

861
00:47:25,863 --> 00:47:29,862
if you did that on the horizontal.
Gridlock's a classic up-and-down.

862
00:47:29,863 --> 00:47:33,422
And in it The Doctor
breaks the rules of the world.

863
00:47:33,423 --> 00:47:38,023
Everyone's stuck in place and he
goes down through the motorway.

864
00:47:46,143 --> 00:47:49,222
He's completely insane!

865
00:47:49,223 --> 00:47:52,222
That, and a bit magnificent.

866
00:47:52,223 --> 00:47:53,942
And the whole motorway has to go

867
00:47:53,943 --> 00:47:58,422
up to escape, so it's got a great
sense of movement to it really.

868
00:47:58,423 --> 00:48:00,622
The most vertical moment the
Doctor had

869
00:48:00,623 --> 00:48:03,782
was when he's stuck in the bowels
of an exploding Titanic,

870
00:48:03,783 --> 00:48:07,182
and has to get out, which is
about to crash onto the Earth,

871
00:48:07,183 --> 00:48:09,622
and The Host lift him up,
and he literally

872
00:48:09,623 --> 00:48:12,622
travels through the story.
He cuts through the story

873
00:48:12,623 --> 00:48:14,302
by going up through the bridge.

874
00:48:14,303 --> 00:48:16,943
He flies, The Doctor flies,
in order to save the day.

875
00:48:22,703 --> 00:48:25,902
I think it's the most vertical
moment The Doctor ever had.

876
00:48:25,903 --> 00:48:27,422
It's something I love doing.

877
00:48:27,423 --> 00:48:31,502
Back on location, and the
children are ready...to be afraid.

878
00:48:31,503 --> 00:48:33,582
Very afraid.

879
00:48:33,583 --> 00:48:34,863
Action!

880
00:48:49,823 --> 00:48:51,783
THEY GASP

881
00:48:53,583 --> 00:48:54,822
You will continue.

882
00:48:54,823 --> 00:48:56,583
And cut.

883
00:48:59,303 --> 00:49:01,662
The scenes where the children
were marched

884
00:49:01,663 --> 00:49:04,542
into the factory with the Cybermen
and the Cybershades,

885
00:49:04,543 --> 00:49:08,702
we shot in Monmouth. It was a
question of having heavily rehearsed

886
00:49:08,703 --> 00:49:11,382
a lot of the stuff with the kids,
and Richard came into his own

887
00:49:11,383 --> 00:49:13,102
in sort of getting a shape to it.

888
00:49:13,103 --> 00:49:16,022
Turn round, please, face the front,
turn left.

889
00:49:16,023 --> 00:49:20,622
To work with that amount of kids
under such a restricted timescale,

890
00:49:20,623 --> 00:49:23,302
it helps to get a sense of the shape
of where you're going.

891
00:49:23,303 --> 00:49:26,062
Obviously you get 30 kids

892
00:49:26,063 --> 00:49:28,182
between the ages of four
and I think 11

893
00:49:28,183 --> 00:49:30,222
on Doctor Who, so they're gonna be

894
00:49:30,223 --> 00:49:32,302
really, really excitable!
So it's hard

895
00:49:32,303 --> 00:49:33,702
calming them all down.

896
00:49:33,703 --> 00:49:35,262
But they have been fantastic

897
00:49:35,263 --> 00:49:38,582
and when the work starts,
they're really professional.

898
00:49:38,583 --> 00:49:39,663
Action.

899
00:49:42,783 --> 00:49:43,823
Keep running!

900
00:49:46,103 --> 00:49:47,903
Keep running! Keep running!

901
00:49:52,903 --> 00:49:54,382
Put me to shame a bit.

902
00:49:54,383 --> 00:49:58,302
DERVLA: They looked fantastic.
They are having fun.

903
00:49:58,303 --> 00:50:01,022
They're really well looked after.
They want to be there.

904
00:50:01,023 --> 00:50:03,022
For any kid,
if I'd had that experience,

905
00:50:03,023 --> 00:50:04,622
to see how it all works

906
00:50:04,623 --> 00:50:07,422
and to see the amount
of different jobs

907
00:50:07,423 --> 00:50:09,022
that go into making

908
00:50:09,023 --> 00:50:13,022
a couple of seconds on film,
it's a great education, really.

909
00:50:13,023 --> 00:50:17,102
Amelia? When you go running,
you stay that side of that lamp

910
00:50:17,103 --> 00:50:19,462
and you go running to that corner.

911
00:50:19,463 --> 00:50:21,942
That's it.
And then you'll see a Cybershade

912
00:50:21,943 --> 00:50:24,222
and you'll come running back.
Well done.

913
00:50:24,223 --> 00:50:27,342
As soon as we've got the frames
and done the lights, we'll rehearse.

914
00:50:27,343 --> 00:50:29,702
There we go, folks.

915
00:50:29,703 --> 00:50:31,823
Rehearsing, and action!

916
00:50:32,863 --> 00:50:36,822
GASPING AND GROWLING

917
00:50:36,823 --> 00:50:39,262
What I like about the scene

918
00:50:39,263 --> 00:50:43,023
is it's one of the scenes you see the
Cybershades almost as guard dogs.

919
00:50:47,543 --> 00:50:50,503
Which I think is the role
they play with the Cybermen.

920
00:50:52,743 --> 00:50:54,902
Thank you.

921
00:50:54,903 --> 00:50:57,662
Shooting, and action!

922
00:50:57,663 --> 00:51:00,622
So, what do we have here?

923
00:51:00,623 --> 00:51:02,782
Walk to me slowly.
Don't let them touch you.

924
00:51:02,783 --> 00:51:05,062
The Doctor meets Miss Hartigan
for the first time

925
00:51:05,063 --> 00:51:08,582
and he initially thinks
that she's on his side.

926
00:51:08,583 --> 00:51:12,182
Oh, but they wouldn't hurt me,
my fine boys.

927
00:51:12,183 --> 00:51:14,262
They're my knights in shining armour

928
00:51:14,263 --> 00:51:16,142
quite literally.

929
00:51:16,143 --> 00:51:19,262
Well, he just assumes
that she's somebody

930
00:51:19,263 --> 00:51:23,342
unwittingly caught up
amongst this Cyber business.

931
00:51:23,343 --> 00:51:24,782
Even if they've converted you,

932
00:51:24,783 --> 00:51:27,462
that's not a Cyber speech pattern.
You've got free will.

933
00:51:27,463 --> 00:51:30,742
I'm telling you, step away!
There has been no conversion, sir.

934
00:51:30,743 --> 00:51:33,182
Miss Hartigan is this, I guess,

935
00:51:33,183 --> 00:51:37,382
this wonderful mix of a
classic Christmas villain.

936
00:51:37,383 --> 00:51:40,582
In that red dress,
she's something for the dads.

937
00:51:40,583 --> 00:51:44,022
At the same time, she's someone
for the kids to boo and hiss at.

938
00:51:44,023 --> 00:51:46,222
Who are you? You can be quiet.

939
00:51:46,223 --> 00:51:48,142
I doubt he paid you to talk.

940
00:51:48,143 --> 00:51:49,462
RUSSELL: There's a hint

941
00:51:49,463 --> 00:51:52,662
That she's a lady of the night,
shall we say, on Christmas Day.

942
00:51:52,663 --> 00:51:54,622
There's a little bit of a past there.

943
00:51:54,623 --> 00:51:56,942
I'm playing Rosita,

944
00:51:56,943 --> 00:51:59,742
and she's basically really sassy,
really mouthy,

945
00:51:59,743 --> 00:52:03,102
she doesn't take anything
from anyone, a tough East End girl.

946
00:52:03,103 --> 00:52:05,542
This is hardly work for a woman.

947
00:52:05,543 --> 00:52:07,582
Don't mind me saving your life!

948
00:52:07,583 --> 00:52:10,542
That's work for a woman, isn't it?
The Doctor's companion

949
00:52:10,543 --> 00:52:12,422
does what The Doctor says.

950
00:52:12,423 --> 00:52:15,662
I've got another big scene coming
up and I get to punch the bad guy,

951
00:52:15,663 --> 00:52:17,663
which is really good.
I can't wait to do it!

952
00:52:20,863 --> 00:52:23,022
Can I say, I completely disapprove?
Come on!

953
00:52:23,023 --> 00:52:25,782
Get up now!

954
00:52:25,783 --> 00:52:28,062
We filmed that
from nine in the evening

955
00:52:28,063 --> 00:52:31,262
till five in the morning so, by
about four o'clock in the morning,

956
00:52:31,263 --> 00:52:33,023
I am no good to anyone.

957
00:52:36,783 --> 00:52:40,622
I was remarkably relaxed,
because I was absolutely exhausted,

958
00:52:40,623 --> 00:52:45,222
and we had a stunt co-ordinator and
we practised it many, many times.

959
00:52:45,223 --> 00:52:49,262
Drop into it, rather than
just going straight back. OK.

960
00:52:49,263 --> 00:52:52,982
Hit and sort of stagger and fall.
OK, that's great.

961
00:52:52,983 --> 00:52:55,902
Otherwise you'll just end up
going straight back. OK.

962
00:52:55,903 --> 00:52:58,942
I've never done anything like that.
I'll see what they tell me to do.

963
00:52:58,943 --> 00:53:02,142
Hopefully I won't make a mistake -
I don't want black eyes on set.

964
00:53:02,143 --> 00:53:05,662
I'm gonna do it slowly, so I'm
kind of going across like that.

965
00:53:05,663 --> 00:53:10,342
It doesn't have to be closer.
It's just the angle of the body.

966
00:53:10,343 --> 00:53:12,102
I'm just gonna go for it.

967
00:53:12,103 --> 00:53:13,502
# I want to get in trouble

968
00:53:13,503 --> 00:53:15,942
# I wanna start a fight na-na-na-na

969
00:53:15,943 --> 00:53:19,742
# Na-na-na-na, I wanna start a fight

970
00:53:19,743 --> 00:53:23,983
# Na-na-na-na-na-na-na,
I wanna start a fight! # Like that.

971
00:53:25,743 --> 00:53:26,783
Camera...

972
00:53:27,703 --> 00:53:30,463
and...action. One last thing.

973
00:53:31,743 --> 00:53:33,662
Argh! Oh!

974
00:53:33,663 --> 00:53:36,542
Can I say, I completely disapprove?
Come on!

975
00:53:36,543 --> 00:53:39,502
RUSSELL: Rosita is designed to be

976
00:53:39,503 --> 00:53:43,023
the archetypal companion. When
The Doctor meets the next Doctor,

977
00:53:43,103 --> 00:53:44,742
he needs to look like The Doctor.

978
00:53:44,743 --> 00:53:48,862
Give me the sonic screwdriver. What?
Quickly! Get back to the TARDIS.

979
00:53:48,863 --> 00:53:53,102
In miniature, she's an absolutely
proper companion, and is brave

980
00:53:53,103 --> 00:53:56,502
and fights and saves the children.
She's wonderful.

981
00:53:56,503 --> 00:53:58,742
So, onwards.

982
00:53:58,743 --> 00:54:00,903
Maybe you should go back.
Don't even try.

983
00:54:02,183 --> 00:54:04,902
She's really good and devoted
and, in the end,

984
00:54:04,903 --> 00:54:08,502
through the whole process, finds
a family and will find a proper home

985
00:54:08,503 --> 00:54:09,622
with Jackson Lake

986
00:54:09,623 --> 00:54:12,503
looking after Frederick. She becomes
the best of friends to him.

987
00:54:16,023 --> 00:54:17,702
I love the end scene at Christmas.

988
00:54:17,703 --> 00:54:21,943
For me it's always The Doctor and
a guest star, the TARDIS and snow.

989
00:54:22,943 --> 00:54:26,542
The city will recover,
as London always does.

990
00:54:26,543 --> 00:54:29,542
The Doctor
is essentially this lonely figure,

991
00:54:29,543 --> 00:54:31,302
and the thing about Christmas

992
00:54:31,303 --> 00:54:33,382
is it's a time for sharing,
for belonging.

993
00:54:33,383 --> 00:54:36,062
And a new history begins for me.

994
00:54:36,063 --> 00:54:41,262
I find myself a widower, but
with my son and with a good friend.

995
00:54:41,263 --> 00:54:44,582
Now, take care of that one.
She's marvellous!

996
00:54:44,583 --> 00:54:47,222
It shows,
finally, how The Doctor is alone.

997
00:54:47,223 --> 00:54:50,302
He's rebuilt Jackson's life and
there's some sort of family

998
00:54:50,303 --> 00:54:54,022
that's come back together, and
The Doctor's heading off on his own.

999
00:54:54,023 --> 00:54:56,023
You won't stay?

1000
00:54:57,583 --> 00:54:59,302
No, you know me.

1001
00:54:59,303 --> 00:55:00,422
It's kind of a curse

1002
00:55:00,423 --> 00:55:03,542
being The Doctor, in some ways,
cos of that loneliness.

1003
00:55:03,543 --> 00:55:05,142
All those facts and figures

1004
00:55:05,143 --> 00:55:07,902
I saw of The Doctor's life,
you were never alone.

1005
00:55:07,903 --> 00:55:10,782
All those bright
and shining companions?

1006
00:55:10,783 --> 00:55:12,742
But not any more?

1007
00:55:12,743 --> 00:55:14,382
No.

1008
00:55:14,383 --> 00:55:18,102
Just having wonderful relationships,
these wonderful bonds with people

1009
00:55:18,103 --> 00:55:19,782
but, ultimately, they have to end.

1010
00:55:19,783 --> 00:55:21,623
I suppose, in the end...

1011
00:55:28,063 --> 00:55:30,782
..they break my heart.

1012
00:55:30,783 --> 00:55:32,982
It's wonderful at the end
where they go off

1013
00:55:32,983 --> 00:55:34,902
into the sunset
for Christmas dinner.

1014
00:55:34,903 --> 00:55:36,383
Action!

1015
00:55:37,983 --> 00:55:41,022
Merry Christmas to you, Jack.

1016
00:55:41,023 --> 00:55:42,902
Merry Christmas indeed, Doctor.

1017
00:55:42,903 --> 00:55:44,342
RUSSELL: He is a man alone,

1018
00:55:44,343 --> 00:55:47,342
and we're gonna be looking
at that in these final stories,

1019
00:55:47,343 --> 00:55:48,702
in David's last stories,

1020
00:55:48,703 --> 00:55:51,342
we're really gonna look at him
and focus on that.

1021
00:55:51,343 --> 00:55:54,262
You can never stop asking yourself,
"Who is The Doctor?"

1022
00:55:54,263 --> 00:55:55,463
It's called Doctor Who.

1023
00:55:56,503 --> 00:55:58,622
There's huge stuff to come -

1024
00:55:58,623 --> 00:56:01,222
epic stuff,
heartbreaking stuff to come.

1025
00:56:01,223 --> 00:56:03,862
He's just the best character
in the world.

1026
00:56:03,863 --> 00:56:10,863
# Have yourself
a merry little Christmas

1027
00:56:12,263 --> 00:56:16,503
# Let your heart be light

1028
00:56:18,783 --> 00:56:21,182
# From now on

1029
00:56:21,183 --> 00:56:26,742
# Our troubles
will be out of sight... #

1030
00:56:26,743 --> 00:56:28,463
A bit of a legend,
if I say so myself.

1031
00:56:31,863 --> 00:56:42,302
# ..Oh, have yourself
a merry little Christmas now. #

1032
00:56:42,303 --> 00:56:45,640
Merry Christmas, Mr Smith.
Merry Christmas, Doctor.

1033
00:57:42,430 --> 00:57:47,880
Come with us as we take you on
a voyage to Christmases past
and present with The Doctor.

1034
00:57:53,569 --> 00:57:59,488
When The Doctor returned to our
screens, his very first trip
back in time was to Christmas.

1035
00:57:59,489 --> 00:58:03,768
Did we make it? Where are we?
I did it! Give the man a medal.

1036
00:58:03,769 --> 00:58:07,928
Naples, December 24th, 1860.
That's so weird.

1037
00:58:07,929 --> 00:58:09,928
It's Christmas.

1038
00:58:09,929 --> 00:58:11,408
All yours.

1039
00:58:11,409 --> 00:58:16,248
'In fact the very first trip
into history that Rose Tyler took
was to Christmas -

1040
00:58:16,249 --> 00:58:19,088
'although that wasn't quite
the plan.'

1041
00:58:19,089 --> 00:58:22,208
It's 1869. I don't care.
And it's not Naples.

1042
00:58:22,209 --> 00:58:24,929
I don't care. It's Cardiff.

1043
00:58:26,729 --> 00:58:27,729
Right.

1044
00:58:30,409 --> 00:58:34,768
'The time and place may have been
wrong, but the date was spot on.'

1045
00:58:34,769 --> 00:58:37,448
It's always very complicated,
but it's doubly so tonight,

1046
00:58:37,449 --> 00:58:41,968
cos we've got special effects,
horses and carriages,

1047
00:58:41,969 --> 00:58:46,368
we've got something like 70 extras
all in period dress as well.

1048
00:58:46,369 --> 00:58:49,368
So it's an enormous thing
to co-ordinate. Terrifying.

1049
00:58:49,369 --> 00:58:52,888
During this very festive visit,
the production team discovered

1050
00:58:52,889 --> 00:58:56,168
that the real magic ingredient
of Christmas is trouble.

1051
00:58:56,169 --> 00:58:57,169
Cut.

1052
00:59:01,529 --> 00:59:03,408
One more, please.

1053
00:59:03,409 --> 00:59:08,448
What scuppered us was the snow
took an hour-and-a-half longer
to lay than we'd planned.

1054
00:59:08,449 --> 00:59:11,848
So from the very beginning
of that night

1055
00:59:11,849 --> 00:59:15,048
we knew that we were up against
it. There was a wind howling

1056
00:59:15,049 --> 00:59:19,608
and the snow is made of paper,
so it gusts it up into the air

1057
00:59:19,609 --> 00:59:22,128
and the horses were terrified.

1058
00:59:22,129 --> 00:59:23,968
HORSE NEIGHS

1059
00:59:23,969 --> 00:59:28,368
It was a very difficult environment
to work in and I was panicking

1060
00:59:28,369 --> 00:59:31,648
that I didn't have the performances
that I wanted from these artists.

1061
00:59:31,649 --> 00:59:36,768
Still, this adventure of showing
how this wonderful place...

1062
00:59:36,769 --> 00:59:40,328
We'll have a couple of beats of that
before the reaction to...

1063
00:59:40,329 --> 00:59:41,368
Exactly, yeah.

1064
00:59:41,369 --> 00:59:45,528
Thank goodness, when I came back
into the edit suite,
I was kind of delighted.

1065
00:59:45,529 --> 00:59:48,089
I'd panicked unnecessarily.

1066
00:59:55,609 --> 00:59:56,688
Action.

1067
00:59:56,689 --> 01:00:01,128
The next time the production team
landed at Christmas
was in the middle of summer.

1068
01:00:01,129 --> 01:00:04,808
The twist for this episode,
given that it's Doctor Who,

1069
01:00:04,809 --> 01:00:08,248
is The Doctor is in the middle of
his regeneration when this happens

1070
01:00:08,249 --> 01:00:09,688
and he ain't there to save us.

1071
01:00:09,689 --> 01:00:12,768
I still say we should take him
to hospital. We can't.

1072
01:00:12,769 --> 01:00:16,368
A lot of this week I'm spending
flat on my back,

1073
01:00:16,369 --> 01:00:20,088
in a poet-regenerative trauma, which
basically means I just lie there

1074
01:00:20,089 --> 01:00:21,968
and everyone comes and mops my brow

1075
01:00:21,969 --> 01:00:26,008
and is terribly nice about me
and listens to my heart
and worries about me.

1076
01:00:26,009 --> 01:00:29,368
It's tough, but I'm getting there.
I'm coping with it.

1077
01:00:29,369 --> 01:00:33,128
So far I think I'm doing a
damn fine job of being unconscious.

1078
01:00:33,129 --> 01:00:35,208
It's some of my finest work,
actually.

1079
01:00:35,209 --> 01:00:40,488
Here we go. Tina the cleaner's
got this medical student.
No she hasn't - she's got a lodger!

1080
01:00:40,489 --> 01:00:42,048
There you go!

1081
01:00:42,049 --> 01:00:44,528
Good as far as it went.
Still rolling.

1082
01:00:44,529 --> 01:00:47,608
While David Tennant enjoyed
an easy day,

1083
01:00:47,609 --> 01:00:49,809
the crew were in
for a long hard night.

1084
01:00:52,409 --> 01:00:54,129
And action.

1085
01:00:57,169 --> 01:00:58,968
Whenever we'd come outdoors,

1086
01:00:58,969 --> 01:01:02,289
on something like this,
it's to do something big.

1087
01:01:06,129 --> 01:01:08,129
SCREAMING

1088
01:01:16,889 --> 01:01:20,688
You can see this huge tree here,
then if we can just...

1089
01:01:20,689 --> 01:01:27,888
just turn and see this tree here,
which, later on, is gonna fall down.

1090
01:01:27,889 --> 01:01:34,288
Santa's over there. Yes. Camera's
back here. Yeah. How's that?

1091
01:01:34,289 --> 01:01:37,448
Then I was gonna put the second
camera looking up at it. OK.

1092
01:01:37,449 --> 01:01:40,208
We'll get that sense of it coming
down towards us. Fine.

1093
01:01:40,209 --> 01:01:43,288
Every set up takes a while.
You can't make this go any faster,

1094
01:01:43,289 --> 01:01:46,329
cos they have to set it safely
and know where it's gonna go "bang".

1095
01:01:49,209 --> 01:01:55,848
Huge set up. Stunt man. Special
effects team. I have to get that
money on camera somehow today,

1096
01:01:55,849 --> 01:01:57,329
to tell that bit of the story.

1097
01:02:00,169 --> 01:02:03,128
Smoke in...and action.

1098
01:02:03,129 --> 01:02:05,928
The Doctor's Christmases
are very much like ours.

1099
01:02:05,929 --> 01:02:10,168
Last minute shopping,
some unexpected guests...

1100
01:02:10,169 --> 01:02:11,568
and there's always a fight.

1101
01:02:11,569 --> 01:02:13,889
Oh, and you've got to have a tree.

1102
01:02:19,649 --> 01:02:21,128
Wagghhh!

1103
01:02:21,129 --> 01:02:25,008
There's definitely
a pattern emerging.

1104
01:02:25,009 --> 01:02:27,328
Killer robots? Check.

1105
01:02:27,329 --> 01:02:28,728
Lethal trees? Yeah.

1106
01:02:28,729 --> 01:02:31,568
Snow? It goes without saying.

1107
01:02:31,569 --> 01:02:34,168
Earth in danger? Definitely.

1108
01:02:34,169 --> 01:02:35,689
And action!

1109
01:02:38,009 --> 01:02:42,088
No matter how much you dread
Christmas with your relatives,

1110
01:02:42,089 --> 01:02:45,088
would you really want to spend it
with The Doctor?

1111
01:02:45,089 --> 01:02:47,848
Come on, then. Robot Santas.
What are they for?

1112
01:02:47,849 --> 01:02:51,968
Ah, your basic robo-scavenger.
The Father Christmas stuff
is just a disguise.

1113
01:02:51,969 --> 01:02:53,488
They're trying to blend in.

1114
01:02:53,489 --> 01:02:57,009
I met them last Christmas.
Why? What happened then?

1115
01:02:58,129 --> 01:03:02,169
Great big spaceship...hovering
over London? You didn't notice?

1116
01:03:03,169 --> 01:03:04,929
I had a bit of a hangover.

1117
01:03:08,729 --> 01:03:10,368
ROARING

1118
01:03:10,369 --> 01:03:15,448
But this was one alien encounter
even Donna Noble couldn't miss.

1119
01:03:15,449 --> 01:03:16,929
SHRIEKING

1120
01:03:19,049 --> 01:03:20,408
ROARING

1121
01:03:20,409 --> 01:03:26,769
MY CHILDREN! AAARGHHH!

1122
01:03:28,889 --> 01:03:32,168
And one thing that Donna realized
early on -

1123
01:03:32,169 --> 01:03:34,368
the ending isn't always happy.

1124
01:03:34,369 --> 01:03:36,608
I DIE!

1125
01:03:36,609 --> 01:03:39,448
Doctor! Aaargh!

1126
01:03:39,449 --> 01:03:41,288
You can stop now.

1127
01:03:41,289 --> 01:03:46,329
MY CHILDREN!

1128
01:03:49,889 --> 01:03:54,568
But Christmas wouldn't be Christmas
without the gift
of a great companion.

1129
01:03:54,569 --> 01:03:58,249
Last year that role was taken
by pint-sized pop princess Kylie.

1130
01:03:59,089 --> 01:04:02,848
It's quite an unusual situation
to find The Doctor in
wandering mode here.

1131
01:04:02,849 --> 01:04:05,928
I was on that ship and he has a
wander, a mooch about on his own

1132
01:04:05,929 --> 01:04:10,168
and joins in with the party,
still feeling like an outsider.
I love that side of him -

1133
01:04:10,169 --> 01:04:13,168
that he travels
to see and experience the world

1134
01:04:13,169 --> 01:04:17,928
and yet that leaves you outside
it all. Yet within seconds
he's making friends with Astrid.

1135
01:04:17,929 --> 01:04:22,208
There we go. Thank you, sir.
I can manage. Just Doctor, not sir.

1136
01:04:22,209 --> 01:04:24,208
The Doctor and she click
within seconds.

1137
01:04:24,209 --> 01:04:28,568
You're not with anyone? No. Just me.
Just, eh...

1138
01:04:28,569 --> 01:04:31,688
'Astrid is a dreamer.
She's alone and dreams to travel.'

1139
01:04:31,689 --> 01:04:37,288
In The Doctor she sees someone who's
living a life that she's dreamt of.

1140
01:04:37,289 --> 01:04:39,248
Red six-seven, plus one?

1141
01:04:39,249 --> 01:04:44,088
Ah, quickly sir, please
and take two bracelets if you would.

1142
01:04:44,089 --> 01:04:50,889
I'll get the sack. Bright new sky.
To repeat, I am Mr Copper,
the ship's historian...

1143
01:04:52,169 --> 01:04:53,368
Oh.

1144
01:04:53,369 --> 01:04:57,408
Donna may not have been paying
attention
but her granddad certainly was.

1145
01:04:57,409 --> 01:05:00,968
Sorry. Obvious question,
but where's everybody gone?

1146
01:05:00,969 --> 01:05:02,368
Oh-ho. Scared.

1147
01:05:02,369 --> 01:05:03,928
Right, yes.

1148
01:05:03,929 --> 01:05:07,848
London? At Christmas?
It's not safe, is it?

1149
01:05:07,849 --> 01:05:11,288
Why? Well, it's them, up above.

1150
01:05:11,289 --> 01:05:16,768
The Christmas before last,
we had that big bloody spaceship -
everyone standing on the roof.

1151
01:05:16,769 --> 01:05:23,648
Last year we had that Christmas star
electrocuting all over the place,
draining the Thames.

1152
01:05:23,649 --> 01:05:29,048
This place is amazing. This year,
God knows what.
So, everybody's scarpered.

1153
01:05:29,049 --> 01:05:30,169
Gone to the country.

1154
01:05:32,049 --> 01:05:33,449
And cut there.

1155
01:05:36,929 --> 01:05:40,088
Of course, some things never change.

1156
01:05:40,089 --> 01:05:42,888
It's Christmas time.
The Doctor is alone again.

1157
01:05:42,889 --> 01:05:45,889
Oh, and the earth is being invaded
by killer machines.

1158
01:05:48,729 --> 01:05:54,888
I'm saying if one of you at least
starts your shot not in the side
we're aiming, that'll help the cut.

1159
01:05:54,889 --> 01:05:58,169
Still, please, folks...and action.

1160
01:05:59,689 --> 01:06:00,928
OK.

1161
01:06:00,929 --> 01:06:02,369
I think we should run.

1162
01:06:03,809 --> 01:06:05,928
Run, Doctor! Now, Doctor.

1163
01:06:05,929 --> 01:06:06,929
Delete.

1164
01:06:09,209 --> 01:06:13,128
I think that's why this episode
worked. It's this wonderful
amalgamation

1165
01:06:13,129 --> 01:06:16,528
of Christmas splendour
and romance and mystery

1166
01:06:16,529 --> 01:06:18,328
and then a great big old
sci-fi romp.

1167
01:06:18,329 --> 01:06:22,088
I'm The Doctor. You need me.
Change your memory banks.

1168
01:06:22,089 --> 01:06:23,248
My name's The Doctor.

1169
01:06:23,249 --> 01:06:26,249
Leave this man alone.
The Doctor is me!

1170
01:06:27,729 --> 01:06:28,888
Delete!

1171
01:06:28,889 --> 01:06:32,088
The Doctor, remember? Agh!
I'm The Doctor.

1172
01:06:32,089 --> 01:06:35,608
You need me alive.
You need The Doctor.

1173
01:06:35,609 --> 01:06:38,248
He may have started out lonely
this Christmas,

1174
01:06:38,249 --> 01:06:41,208
but this year he's got a doctor
as a companion

1175
01:06:41,209 --> 01:06:46,089
and if that isn't confusing enough,
try working out
just who is saving who.

1176
01:06:48,809 --> 01:06:51,129
Arrrgh!

1177
01:06:53,729 --> 01:06:57,528
We've seen Christmas past
and Christmas present

1178
01:06:57,529 --> 01:06:59,129
but what about Christmas future?

1179
01:07:00,449 --> 01:07:07,329
One thing we can say for sure
is that he'll be there
and trouble won't be far behind.
