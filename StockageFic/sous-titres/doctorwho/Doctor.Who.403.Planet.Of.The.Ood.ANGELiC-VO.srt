1
00:00:03,259 --> 00:00:06,700
The Ood.
They came from a distant world.

2
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:09,300
They voyaged across the stars.

3
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:11,660
All with one purpose.

4
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:13,539
Do you take milk and sugar?

5
00:00:13,539 --> 00:00:15,979
To serve! Oh, that's good.

6
00:00:15,979 --> 00:00:18,619
That's excellent. I like it, sir.

7
00:00:18,619 --> 00:00:20,980
Buy one now!
Direct, straight to the point!

8
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:24,699
We play that across the Tri-Galactic
for two weeks, then introduce this.

9
00:00:24,699 --> 00:00:27,179
Now only 50 credits.

10
00:00:27,179 --> 00:00:29,980
50? We're reducing the
price to 50 credits?

11
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:33,699
Sales are down, we've got to
reposition ourselves. So get going.

12
00:00:33,699 --> 00:00:37,220
Idiot! Bleeding us dry.

13
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:40,300
You there, get me last month's
military export figures.

14
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:42,539
The army always need more grunts.

15
00:00:42,539 --> 00:00:45,299
Yes, sir.

16
00:00:45,299 --> 00:00:47,459
Mr Bartle, you asked me to call you?

17
00:00:47,459 --> 00:00:51,539
Solana, when those buyers arrive, we
are going to pitch like never before.

18
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:53,740
I want those Ood flying out of here!

19
00:00:55,299 --> 00:00:58,700
That... I said military figures,
that's the domestic file.

20
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:01,139
Get me the military!

21
00:01:01,139 --> 00:01:03,139
The file is irrelevant, sir.

22
00:01:03,139 --> 00:01:04,940
Oh, and why's that?

23
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:07,260
Aargh! Have a nice day!

24
00:01:32,402 --> 00:01:34,902
Doctor Who - 4x03

26
00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:55,499
Set the controls to random.
Mystery tour!

27
00:01:55,499 --> 00:01:59,699
Outside that door
could be any planet, anywhere,
anywhen, in the whole, wide uni...

28
00:02:02,099 --> 00:02:06,900
I mean, history's one thing,
but an alien planet!
I could always take you home.

29
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:09,659
Yeah, don't laugh at me.
I know what it's like.

30
00:02:09,659 --> 00:02:11,540
Everything you're feeling right now.

31
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:14,180
The fear, the joy, the wonder.
I get that.

32
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:16,219
Seriously? After all this time?

33
00:02:16,219 --> 00:02:18,059
Yeah! Why do you think I keep going?

34
00:02:18,059 --> 00:02:21,499
Oh, all right then. You and me both.

35
00:02:21,499 --> 00:02:23,579
This is barmy!

36
00:02:23,579 --> 00:02:26,819
I was born in Chiswick!
I've only ever done package
holidays.

37
00:02:26,819 --> 00:02:30,220
Now I'm here! This is...

38
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:32,379
I mean it's...
I dunno, it's all sort of...

39
00:02:32,379 --> 00:02:34,499
I don't even know what the word is!

40
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:40,979
Oh, I've got the word.

41
00:02:40,979 --> 00:02:43,180
Freezing!

42
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:46,859
Snow! Ah, real snow.

43
00:02:46,859 --> 00:02:48,659
Proper snow at last!

44
00:02:48,659 --> 00:02:50,779
That's more like it, lovely!
What do you think?

45
00:02:50,779 --> 00:02:53,260
Bit cold. look at that view!

46
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:54,899
Yep.

47
00:02:54,899 --> 00:02:56,459
Beautiful, cold view.

48
00:02:56,459 --> 00:02:59,980
Millions of planets in millions
of galaxies, and we're on this one!

49
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:02,459
Multo bene! Bellissimo!

50
00:03:02,459 --> 00:03:05,019
Says Donna. Born in Chiswick.

51
00:03:05,019 --> 00:03:11,660
Oh, you've had a life of work
and sleep and telly, and rent
and tax and takeaway dinners.

52
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:16,979
All birthdays and Christmases
and two weeks holiday a year.
And then you end up here.

53
00:03:16,979 --> 00:03:19,619
Donna Noble, citizen of the Earth.

54
00:03:19,619 --> 00:03:21,779
Standing on a different planet!

55
00:03:21,779 --> 00:03:23,219
How about that, Donna?

56
00:03:24,859 --> 00:03:27,739
Donna?

57
00:03:27,739 --> 00:03:30,419
Sorry, you were saying? Better?

58
00:03:30,419 --> 00:03:33,059
Lovely, thanks. Comfy? Yup.

59
00:03:33,059 --> 00:03:36,340
Can you hear anything inside that?
Pardon?

60
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:39,059
Right, I was saying,
citizen of the Earth.

61
00:03:39,059 --> 00:03:42,019
A rocket!

62
00:03:42,019 --> 00:03:44,140
Blimey, a real, proper rocket!

63
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:48,140
Now, that's what I call a spaceship.

64
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:50,740
You've got a box,
he's got a Ferrari!

65
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:54,020
Come on, let's see where he's going.

66
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:01,700
Mr Halpen, sir.
Dr Ryder, new Head of Ood Management.

67
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:03,700
How many dead? Come on,
facts and figures.

68
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:08,339
I haven't flown all this way
to discuss the weather. Which is
freezing. Solana has the figures.

69
00:04:08,339 --> 00:04:12,460
Solana Mercurio, sir. Head of
Marketing and Galactic Liaison.
Just what I need, a PR woman(!)

70
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:14,620
I don't want a word of this
getting out, understand?

71
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:17,860
Now, get to the point.
How many dead?

72
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:21,059
In the past financial quarter, we've
had three deaths in the complex.

73
00:04:21,059 --> 00:04:24,140
All attributed to heart attacks
or industrial accidents.

74
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:27,700
But now we've captured this on tape,
the cause would seem the same.

75
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:30,460
It's using the translator ball
as a weapon. How's that work?

76
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:33,339
I've no idea. I'm checking
the equipment, nothing so far.

77
00:04:33,339 --> 00:04:35,500
Can't see its eyes from this angle.

78
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,059
I think we have to assume...

79
00:04:37,059 --> 00:04:38,779
Red-eye. I would think so, sir.

80
00:04:38,779 --> 00:04:40,300
That Ood, what happened to it?

81
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:41,939
Ran for the wilds, sir, like a dog.

82
00:04:41,939 --> 00:04:45,140
One of the guards fired off a shot,
it'll be dead by now.

83
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:46,900
Can I ask, what's red-eye, sir?

84
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:50,299
Some sort of infection.
The Ood eyes literally change colour.

85
00:04:50,299 --> 00:04:54,220
Drink! I can't find the source,
all the bacterial scans
register negative.

86
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:58,580
I'm sorry, but according
to your own rules, sir,
there's no alcohol allowed on base.

87
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:01,180
It's hair tonic, if you must know.

88
00:05:04,099 --> 00:05:06,460
Five years ago,
I had a full head of hair.

89
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:09,419
Stress, that's what this is, stress!

90
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:16,820
THEY LAUGH

91
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:26,380
EERIE SINGING
Hold on, can you hear that?

92
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:30,700
That noise, it's like a song.

93
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:34,420
Over there!

94
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:38,139
What is it?

95
00:05:38,139 --> 00:05:40,820
An Ood. He's called an Ood.

96
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:42,619
But its face...

97
00:05:42,619 --> 00:05:46,580
Donna, don't. Not now.
It's a he, not an it. Give me a hand.

98
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:48,980
Sorry!

99
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:51,940
I don't know where the heart is.
I don't know if he's GOT a heart.

100
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:53,500
Talk to him, keep him going.

101
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:55,780
It's all right, we've got you.

102
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:59,980
Um, what's your name?

103
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:02,019
Designated Ood

104
00:06:02,019 --> 00:06:03,779
Delta 50.

105
00:06:06,739 --> 00:06:08,339
My name's Donna.

106
00:06:08,339 --> 00:06:10,300
No, no, no, no. You don't need to...

107
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:12,500
Sorry.

108
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:15,419
Oh, God! This is the Doctor!

109
00:06:15,419 --> 00:06:19,300
Just what you need, a doctor.
Couldn't be better, eh?

110
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:21,019
You've been shot.

111
00:06:21,019 --> 00:06:23,020
The circle... No, don't try to talk.

112
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:24,619
The circle must be broken.

113
00:06:24,619 --> 00:06:27,459
Circle? What do you mean?
Delta 50, what circle?

114
00:06:27,459 --> 00:06:30,059
Delta 50, what circle?

115
00:06:30,059 --> 00:06:32,060
Aargh!

116
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:41,340
He's gone.

117
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:42,780
Careful.

118
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:46,379
There you are, sweetheart.

119
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:51,980
We were too late. What do we do,
do we bury him or...?

120
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:54,740
The snow will take care of that.

121
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:56,379
Who was he? What's an Ood?

122
00:06:56,379 --> 00:07:00,419
They're servants,
of humans in the 42nd century.

123
00:07:00,419 --> 00:07:02,660
Mildly telepathic, that was the song.

124
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:05,340
It was his mind calling out.

125
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:06,819
Couldn't hear anything.

126
00:07:09,499 --> 00:07:11,220
He sang as he was dying.

127
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:14,420
His eyes turned red.
What's that mean?

128
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:17,019
Trouble. Come on.

129
00:07:17,019 --> 00:07:19,619
The Ood are harmless.
They're completely benign.

130
00:07:19,619 --> 00:07:22,859
Except, the last time I met them,
there was this force,

131
00:07:22,859 --> 00:07:26,019
like a stronger mind,
powerful enough to take them over.

132
00:07:26,019 --> 00:07:28,820
What sort of force? Long story.

133
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:31,220
Long walk. It was the Devil.

134
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:33,979
If you're gonna take the mickey,
I'll just put my hood back up.

135
00:07:33,979 --> 00:07:36,460
Must be something different
this time, though.

136
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:38,819
Something closer to home.

137
00:07:38,819 --> 00:07:41,020
A-ha!

138
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:43,340
Civilisation!

139
00:07:44,779 --> 00:07:47,980
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to the Ood-Sphere.

140
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:55,059
And isn't it bracing? Here are your
information packs, with vouchers,
3D tickets and a map of the complex.

141
00:07:55,059 --> 00:07:59,060
My name's Solana, Head of Marketing.
I'm sure we've all spoken
on the vidfone.

142
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:01,059
Now, if you'd like to follow me.
Sorry, sorry, sorry! Late.

143
00:08:01,059 --> 00:08:02,740
Don't mind us. Hello!
The guards let us through.

144
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:05,179
And you would be?
The Doctor and Donna Noble.

145
00:08:05,179 --> 00:08:09,620
Representing the Noble Corporation
PLC Limited, Intergalactic.

146
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:12,779
Must have fallen off my list,
my apologies. Won't happen again.

147
00:08:12,779 --> 00:08:15,259
Now then, Dr Noble, Mrs Noble,
if you'd like to come with me.

148
00:08:15,259 --> 00:08:17,740
Oh, no, no, we're not married!
We're so not married. Never.

149
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:19,700
Never ever! Of course.

150
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:22,140
And here are your information
packs, vouchers inside.

151
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:25,940
Now if you'd like to come with me,
the Executive Suites
are nice and warm.

152
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:29,139
ALARM WAILS
What's that? Sounds like an alarm.

153
00:08:29,139 --> 00:08:32,259
For God's sake, we've got the buyers
arriving, who sounded the alarm?

154
00:08:32,259 --> 00:08:37,340
Drink! Oh, it's just a siren
for the end of the work shift. Now
then, this way, quick as you can!

155
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:42,419
Mr Kess, what the hell's going on?
Ood on the loose, sir.

156
00:08:42,419 --> 00:08:45,460
Looks like we've got another one.
Red-eye? As red as sin, sir.

157
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:47,020
Don't worry, Mr Halpen, we're on it.

158
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:48,539
Sir!

159
00:08:48,539 --> 00:08:51,140
All right then, lads - go, get him!

160
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:57,179
As you can see, the Ood are happy
to serve, and we keep them in
facilities of the highest standard.

161
00:08:58,619 --> 00:09:04,819
Here at the Double O - that's
Ood Operations - we like to think
of the Ood as our trusted friends.

162
00:09:04,819 --> 00:09:06,779
Over there. You two follow me.

163
00:09:06,779 --> 00:09:09,539
We keep the Ood healthy,
safe, and educated.

164
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:12,940
Take him alive!

165
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:15,220
We don't just breed the Ood.

166
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:20,939
We make them better.

167
00:09:20,939 --> 00:09:23,780
but a reflection of us?

168
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:26,380
If your Ood is happy...

169
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:29,140
Aaargh!

170
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:30,739
..then you'll be happy, too.

171
00:09:33,539 --> 00:09:38,339
Mr Halpen, this is a bit more
than red-eye, sir.

172
00:09:38,339 --> 00:09:40,300
This is something new,

173
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:43,259
it's rabid, sir. Aaargh!

174
00:09:43,259 --> 00:09:44,860
Take it to Dr Ryder.

175
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:50,660
Just get it out of sight!

176
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:52,219
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

177
00:09:59,939 --> 00:10:02,460
What do you think? Growing back?

178
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:03,939
Just a little bit?

179
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:08,500
Like you'd know!

180
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:12,500
I'd now like to point out a new
innovation from Ood Operations.

181
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:16,019
W've introduced a variety package
with the Ood translator ball.

182
00:10:16,019 --> 00:10:18,020
You can now have
the Standard Setting.

183
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:19,859
How are you today, Ood?

184
00:10:19,859 --> 00:10:22,019
I'm perfectly well, thank you.

185
00:10:22,019 --> 00:10:25,780
Or perhaps, after a stressful day, a
little something for the gentlemen.

186
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:27,340
And how are you, Ood?

187
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:29,379
SULTRY FEMALE VOICE:
All the better for seeing you.

188
00:10:29,379 --> 00:10:32,539
And the comedy classic option.
Ood, you dropped something.

189
00:10:32,539 --> 00:10:34,580
D'oh!

190
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:37,739
All that for only five
additional credits.

191
00:10:37,739 --> 00:10:39,739
The details are in your brochures.

192
00:10:39,739 --> 00:10:43,619
Now, there's plenty more food
and drink, so, don't hold back.

193
00:10:51,299 --> 00:10:53,539
Ah, got it!

194
00:10:53,539 --> 00:10:58,900
The Ood-Sphere, I've been to this
solar system before, years ago, ages!

195
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:01,100
Close to the planet Sense-Sphere.

196
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:02,540
Widen out.

197
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:12,700
The year 4126. That is the Second
Great and Bountiful Human Empire.

198
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:14,979
4126.

199
00:11:14,979 --> 00:11:17,699
It's 4126.

200
00:11:17,699 --> 00:11:21,860
I'm in 4126. It's good, isn't it?

201
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:23,500
What's the Earth like now?

202
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:27,340
Bit full. But you see, the Empire
stretches out across three galaxies.

203
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:30,179
It's weird.
I mean, it's brilliant, but...

204
00:11:30,179 --> 00:11:34,140
Back home, the papers and the telly
keep saying we haven't got long
to live.

205
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:36,579
Global warming. Flooding.

206
00:11:36,579 --> 00:11:36,659
All the bees disappearing. Yeah,

207
00:11:36,659 --> 00:11:39,299
that thing about the bees is odd.

208
00:11:42,059 --> 00:11:44,660
But look at us! We're everywhere.

209
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:47,380
Is that good or bad, though?
Are we like explorers?

210
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:50,260
Or more like a virus?
Sometimes I wonder.

211
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:51,900
What are the red dots?

212
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:53,860
Ood distribution centres.

213
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:55,859
Across three galaxies?

214
00:11:55,859 --> 00:11:57,580
Don't the Ood get a say in this?

215
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:02,460
Um, sorry, but...

216
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:10,060
Hello. Tell me,
are you ALL like this?

217
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:11,899
I do not understand, Miss.

218
00:12:11,899 --> 00:12:13,940
Why do you say "Miss",
do I look single?

219
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:16,060
Back to the point. Yeah.

220
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:19,660
What I mean is,
are there any free Ood?

221
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:23,860
Are there Ood running wild
somewhere? Like wildebeest.

222
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:25,859
All Ood are born to serve.

223
00:12:25,859 --> 00:12:27,420
Otherwise, we would die.

224
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:30,019
But you can't have
started like that.

225
00:12:30,019 --> 00:12:34,140
Before the humans,
what were you like? The circle.

226
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:35,739
What do you mean, what circle?

227
00:12:35,739 --> 00:12:38,019
The circle, the circle is...

228
00:12:38,019 --> 00:12:41,500
Ladies and gentlemen! All Ood
to Hospitality Stations, please.

229
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:44,259
I've had enough of the schmoozing.

230
00:12:44,259 --> 00:12:47,660
Do you fancy going off the beaten
track? If I can introduce you...

231
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:49,460
Rough Guide to the Ood-Sphere?

232
00:12:51,899 --> 00:12:54,659
Waargh! What the hell
is wrong with it?

233
00:12:54,659 --> 00:12:56,660
It's obviously stage two of red-eye.

234
00:12:56,660 --> 00:12:58,220
Whatever that means.

235
00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:00,980
Ood Sigma, have you
seen this before?

236
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:02,740
Humanity defines us, sir.

237
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:04,460
We look to you for answers.

238
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:06,860
Fat lot of good, all of you.

239
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:11,060
We're exporting hundreds
of thousands of Ood
to all the civilised planets.

240
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:13,500
If they turn rabid,
you know what it'll mean.

241
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:16,940
There's only one thing
I haven't checked, sir. Warehouse 15.

242
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:21,539
Why should that cause trouble?
It's been two centuries now.

243
00:13:21,539 --> 00:13:26,499
I know it's restricted access,
but if I'm going to work on this,
I should see it. Just in case.

244
00:13:26,499 --> 00:13:29,140
Can't stand the place.

245
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:32,660
Still. Warehouse 15 then, come on.

246
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:34,299
What about this one, sir?

247
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:38,499
Well, I'd suggest a post mortem.

248
00:13:38,499 --> 00:13:40,460
Which means it's
got to be dead first.

249
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:43,460
Aargh! Aargh!

250
00:13:45,179 --> 00:13:47,619
GUNFIRE

251
00:13:47,619 --> 00:13:50,860
'Ood shift eight, now commencing.

252
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:54,340
'Repeat,
Ood shift eight now commencing.'

253
00:14:14,659 --> 00:14:17,740
Get up! I said get up!

254
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:20,980
Servants? They're slaves.

255
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:23,060
Get up!

256
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:25,300
March!

257
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:31,859
Last time I met the Ood,
I never thought. I never asked.
That's not like you. I was busy.

258
00:14:31,859 --> 00:14:37,460
So busy I couldn't save them,
I had to let the Ood die.
I reckon I owe them one.

259
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:41,260
That looks like the boss.
Let's keep out of his way. Come on.

260
00:14:44,299 --> 00:14:46,620
How long since you went inside?

261
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:50,460
Must be... ten years ago.

262
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:57,899
'Warehouse 15.' My father brought
me here, when I was six years old.

263
00:14:57,899 --> 00:15:00,940
'Security protocol initiated.'
God, the stench of it.

264
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:03,340
'Warehouse 15. Door open.'

265
00:15:07,299 --> 00:15:09,860
ELECTRICAL CRACKLING

266
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:18,539
Incredible.

267
00:15:18,539 --> 00:15:22,340
Like I said. Nothing's changed.

268
00:15:25,059 --> 00:15:29,740
I've read the documents, but...
it doesn't quite prepare you.

269
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:33,100
Is it just me, or does it feel
as if it's looking at you?

270
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:33,140
I think I understand
the barrier mechanics well enough.
I'll check the signal.

271
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:37,420
Suppose it's home sweet home to you.
What d'you think?

272
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:47,780
I have no opinion, sir. Well...

273
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:50,459
say hello to Daddy.

274
00:15:50,459 --> 00:15:55,260
Nothing. The barrier's intact.
No abnormal signal.
Same as it's been for 200 years.

275
00:15:57,380 --> 00:16:02,260
'Mr Halpen, the two people from the
Noble Corporation failed to pass
security checks.

276
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:05,659
There's no such company,
the Noble Corporation doesn't exist.

277
00:16:05,659 --> 00:16:08,539
And on top of that, they seem
to have gone missing, sir,

278
00:16:08,539 --> 00:16:10,700
'the Doctor and Miss Noble.'

279
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:14,579
Just what I need(!)
Start a search, no alarms, got that?

280
00:16:14,579 --> 00:16:16,460
Keep it quiet.

281
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:20,099
You see? Hair loss! Drink!

282
00:16:23,699 --> 00:16:27,820
Tell you what, old friend.
Have this one on me.

283
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:30,900
Cheers!

284
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:33,979
LOUD RUMBLE

285
00:16:33,979 --> 00:16:36,179
I think we're finished here.

286
00:16:42,419 --> 00:16:44,579
Sorry.

287

ELECTRICAL CRACKLING

288
00:16:52,659 --> 00:16:54,659
PIERCING WHISTLE

289
00:16:56,739 --> 00:17:00,060
Where d'you learn to whistle?
West Ham, every Saturday.

290
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:20,180
Ood export.

291
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:22,540
D'you see?
Lifts up the containers,

292
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:26,580
takes them to the rocket sheds,
ready to be flown out,

293
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:29,300
all over the three galaxies...

294
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:32,700
What, you mean,
these containers are full of..?

295
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:35,060
What d'you think?

296
00:17:41,099 --> 00:17:43,859
Ohhh, it stinks!

297
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:48,700
How many of them
do you think there are in each one?

298
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:54,500
A hundred? More? A great big
empire, built on slavery.

299
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:57,899
It's not so different from your
time. Oy! I haven't got slaves!

300
00:17:57,899 --> 00:18:03,020
Who d'you think made your clothes?
Is that why you travel
round with a human

301
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:06,979
at your side? It's not so you can
show them the wonders
of the universe,

302
00:18:06,979 --> 00:18:09,379
it's so you can take cheap shots?

303
00:18:09,379 --> 00:18:12,179
Sorry. Well, don't.

304
00:18:12,179 --> 00:18:14,460
Space Man.

305
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:18,700
I don't understand, the door was
open, why don't you just run away?

306
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:24,260
For what reason? You could be free.
I do not understand the concept.

307
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:27,019
What is it with that Persil ball?

308
00:18:27,019 --> 00:18:31,060
I mean, they're not born with it,
are they? Why do they have to be
all plugged in?

309
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:33,820
Ood, tell me, does 'the circle'
mean anything to you?

310
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:36,779
ALL: The circle must be broken.

311
00:18:36,779 --> 00:18:39,340
Woah, that is creepy!

312
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:43,420
But what is it? What is the circle?
The circle must be broken.

313
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:44,739
Why?

314
00:18:44,739 --> 00:18:47,980
So that we can sing.

315
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:54,020
Mr Halpen? I'm in Ood Cargo,
I've found your unwanted guests. Go!

00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:56,979
ALARM WAILS
Oh, I think that's us! Come on!

317
00:18:56,979 --> 00:19:01,020
Cut the alarms! I said, no alarms!

318
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:04,940
Nothing to worry about, ladies and
gentlemen, it's just a fire drill.

319
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:09,380
We test the system at this time
every day. If you'll excuse me.

320
00:19:15,499 --> 00:19:18,300
Doctor, there's a door!

321
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:23,100
Don't move... Where've you gone?
..stay where you are.

322
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:27,779
Get off me! Get off me!

323
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:37,220
Donna! Where are you?

324
00:19:38,779 --> 00:19:41,620
All guards withdraw. 'Sir?'
I said withdraw.

325
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:45,020
Keep to the perimeter.
I've got this one.

326
00:19:50,339 --> 00:19:53,699
I've always wanted to do this.

327
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:01,940
Container locked. Ahh!

328
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:17,060
Can you help me?

329
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:19,740
Oh, no, you don't!

330
00:20:31,259 --> 00:20:35,060
What have I done? I'm not one
of that lot. I'm on YOUR side!

331
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:48,100
Just stay where you are.
That's an order.

332
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:52,259
I said, stay! Doctor! Doctor...!

333
00:21:11,619 --> 00:21:14,339
You heard the instructions.
Mr Halpen wants them alive.

334
00:21:14,339 --> 00:21:17,579
Doctor, get me out!

335
00:21:17,579 --> 00:21:23,339
Doctor, get me out of here!

336
00:21:23,339 --> 00:21:26,900
Not from me, from her.
Unlock the container!

337
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:33,100
Doctor! There we go, safe and sound.

338
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:35,300
Never mind about me,
what about them?!

339
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:36,620
Aaargh!

340
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:40,500
Red alert! Fire!

341
00:21:41,379 --> 00:21:43,900
Shoot to kill!

342
00:22:01,339 --> 00:22:05,579
If people back on Earth...
knew what was going on here...
Oh, don't be so stupid.

343
00:22:05,579 --> 00:22:10,100
Of course they know.
They know how you treat the Ood?
They don't ask. Same thing.

344
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:14,940
The Ood aren't born like this.
A species born to serve could never
evolve in the first place.

345
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:19,380
What does the company do to make them
obey? That's nothing to do with me!
What, cos you don't ask?

346
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:23,459
That's Dr Ryder's territory. And
where's he? What part of the complex?

347
00:22:23,459 --> 00:22:26,500
I could help,
with the red-eye, now show me!

348
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:29,140
There. Beyond the red section.

349
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:32,980
Come with me.
You've seen the warehouse,
you can't agree with all this.

350
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:36,380
You know this place better than me,
you could help.

351
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:44,140
SHE SHOUTS: They're over here!
Guards! They're over here!

352
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:48,379
Male and female suspects escaped.
Wasteridge corridor.

353
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:58,300
Mr Halpen, I found the Doctor.
He's heading for Ood Conversion.

354
00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:01,220
'On my way.'
Mr Kess, what's the situation?

355
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:06,500
We've contained it, sir, fenced them
in. But the red eye seems to be
permanent this time, it's not fading.

356
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:09,580
Worse than that, sir...
there's more of them going rabid.

357
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:13,580
My opinion, sir, I think we've lost
them. The entire batch, contaminated.

358
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:18,100
What's causing it?
Why now? What's changed?

359
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:26,860
How many Ood, in total?
I'd say about 2,000, sir.

360
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:29,300
'We can write them off,
that's what insurance is for.'

361
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:33,859
Drink! We've plenty more on the
Breeding Farms, let's start again.

362
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:42,099
Fetch the canisters.
'No survivors.'

363
00:23:42,099 --> 00:23:45,099
My pleasure, sir.
You lot - canisters!

364
00:23:56,140 --> 00:23:58,859
Oh, can you hear it?

365
00:23:58,859 --> 00:24:02,060
I didn't need the map,
I should've listened.

366
00:24:08,739 --> 00:24:11,339
Hold on. Does that mean
we're locked in? Listen.

367
00:24:11,339 --> 00:24:15,539
Listen, listen, listen, listen...
EERIE SINGING

368

Oh, my head!

369
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:29,140
What is it? Can't you hear it?

370
00:24:29,140 --> 00:24:31,139
The singing?

371
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:44,379
THEY SING

372
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:53,819
They look different to the others.

373
00:24:53,819 --> 00:24:57,740
That's because they're
natural-born Ood, unprocessed,

374
00:24:57,740 --> 00:25:00,779
before they're adapted to slavery.
Unspoilt.

375
00:25:00,779 --> 00:25:04,060
SINGING CONTINUES

376
00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:08,700
That's their song. I can't hear it.

377
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:10,979
D'you want to?

378
00:25:12,859 --> 00:25:14,019
Yeah.

379
00:25:15,259 --> 00:25:19,260
It's the song of captivity.
Let me hear it.

380
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:21,820
Face me.

381
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:28,579
Open your mind, that's it.

382
00:25:28,579 --> 00:25:31,779
CLEAR, SAD SINGING
Hear it, Donna.

383
00:25:31,779 --> 00:25:36,459
Hear the music. Oh...!

SINGING CONTINUES

385
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:51,860
Take it away.

386
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:53,780
You sure?

387
00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:55,979
I can't bear it.

388
00:26:00,299 --> 00:26:01,980
I'm sorry.

389
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:03,299
That's OK.

390
00:26:07,499 --> 00:26:10,620
But you can still hear it?

391
00:26:12,579 --> 00:26:14,579
All the time.

392
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:24,460
What's the hold-up? It's the
experimentation lab, maximum
security, he's fused the system.

393
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:29,059
Don't just stand there, get the
bolt-cutters, rip that door off!
Solana, go back to the reps,

394
00:26:29,059 --> 00:26:33,500
I don't want any of them wandering
off and seeing this. And get them
away from the Ood, just in case.

395
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:35,779
Hurry up! Yes, sir.

396
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:41,300
METALLIC THUD
They're breaking in.

397
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:43,859
Ah, let them.

398
00:26:44,899 --> 00:26:47,339
What are you holding? Show me.

399
00:26:49,660 --> 00:26:52,219
Friend.

400
00:26:52,219 --> 00:26:54,419
Doctor. Donna. Friend.

401
00:26:54,419 --> 00:26:58,140
Let me see... Look at me...

402
00:26:58,140 --> 00:27:00,340
Let me see.

403
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:03,580
That's it. That's it, go on. Go on...

404
00:27:09,539 --> 00:27:11,500
Is that...?

405
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:14,099
It's a brain. A hind brain.

406
00:27:14,099 --> 00:27:18,059
The Ood are born with a secondary
brain. Like the amygdala in humans,

407
00:27:18,059 --> 00:27:22,540
it processes memory and emotions.
Get rid of that and you wouldn't be
Donna any more. You'd be like an Ood,

408
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:26,339
a processed Ood. So the company...
cuts off their brains?

409
00:27:26,339 --> 00:27:28,499
And they stitch on the translator.

410
00:27:28,499 --> 00:27:30,460
Like a lobotomy.

411
00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:34,499
I spent all that time
looking for you, Doctor,

412
00:27:34,499 --> 00:27:38,260
because I thought it would be
so wonderful out here.

413
00:27:39,779 --> 00:27:42,020
I want to go home.

414
00:27:44,579 --> 00:27:46,060
THUD

415
00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:50,860
They're with the Ood, sir.
What you gonna do, then? Arrest me?

416
00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:55,779
Lock me up? Throw me in a cage?
Well, you're too late! Hah!

417
00:27:55,779 --> 00:27:59,380
Why don't you just come out
and say it? FOTO activists!

418
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:03,979
If that's what Friends Of The Ood
are trying to prove, yes!
The Ood were nothing without us,

419
00:28:03,979 --> 00:28:08,299
just animals roaming on the ice.
That's because you can't hear them.
They welcomed it!

420
00:28:08,299 --> 00:28:11,100
It's not as if they put up a fight.
You idiot!

421
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:14,900
They're born with their brains
in their hands, don't you see?

422
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:18,339
That makes them peaceful,
they've got to be,

423
00:28:18,339 --> 00:28:22,420
cos a creature like that
would have to trust anyone it meets.
Oh, nice one. Thank you!

424
00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:26,219
The system's worked for 200 years.
All we've got is a rogue batch.

425
00:28:26,219 --> 00:28:31,019
But the infection is about
to be sterilised. Mr Kess?

426
00:28:31,019 --> 00:28:35,020
How do we stand?
Canisters primed, sir.

427
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:38,420
As soon as the core heats up,
the gas is released.

428
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:42,299
Give it 200 marks...
and counting.

429
00:28:42,299 --> 00:28:45,219
You're gonna gas them?!
Kill the livestock.

430
00:28:45,219 --> 00:28:48,260
The classic foot-and-mouth solution
from the olden days.

431
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:49,580
Still works.

I'm sorry, if I could ask you one
more time, could all the Reps please

436
00:29:08,939 --> 00:29:13,059
come through to the
Education Suites.
Why move now? It's a free bar!

437
00:29:13,059 --> 00:29:17,620
Could I ask all the Ood
to withdraw, it's feeding time.

438
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:21,820
Aw! You've upset them.
Leave them alone!

439
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:24,779
I have to insist.
If all the Ood could please leave...

440
00:29:35,579 --> 00:29:39,700
Ladies and gentlemen,
change of plan. If you could leave
by the fire exits.

441
00:29:41,660 --> 00:29:44,180
I could sell this!
You could offer different colours.

449
00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:37,780
'Emergency status. Emergency status.
All exits sealed.'

450
00:30:47,659 --> 00:30:50,060

No reports of trouble
off-world, sir, it's still
contained to the Ood-Sphere.

455
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:20,820
We've got a public duty to stop it

456
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:25,140
Everything you wanted.
No doubt there'll be a full police
investigation once this place

457
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:30,580
has been sterilised, so I can't risk
a bullet to the head. I'll leave
you to the mercies of the Ood.

458
00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:34,580
But there's something else,
isn't there? Something
we haven't seen! What?

459
00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:38,619
A creature couldn't survive with a
separate fore brain and hind brain,
they'd be at war with themselves,

460
00:31:38,619 --> 00:31:44,220
there's got to be a third element.
So clever! It's got to be connected
to the red-eye, what is it?

461
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:47,459
"It" won't exist
for very much longer.

00:31:47,459 --> 00:31:49,780

It's always been an option,
my grandfather drew up this plan.

488
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:39,299
That's the advantage of a family-run
business, Dr Ryder. The personal
touch. But we should evacuate.

connecting all the Ood in song.

500
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:51,700
Cargo. I can always go into cargo.

501
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:58,499
I've got the rockets, I've got the
sheds. Smaller business, much more
manageable, without livestock.

502
00:35:58,499 --> 00:36:01,339
He's mined the area.
They're gonna kill it?

503
00:36:01,339 --> 00:36:05,579
They found that...thing centuries
ago beneath the Northern Glacier.

504
00:36:05,579 --> 00:36:12,540
Those pylons. In a circle.
"The circle must be broken."
Damping the telepathic field.

505
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:15,700
Stopping the Ood from connecting
for 200 years.

506
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:22,580
And you, Ood Sigma, you brought
them here. I expected better.

507
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:25,619
Ha-ha! Still subservient.

508
00:36:25,619 --> 00:36:27,700
Good Ood.

509
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:31,499
If that barrier thing's in place,
how come the Ood started
breaking out?

510
00:36:31,499 --> 00:36:35,780
Maybe it's taken centuries to adapt.
The subconscious reaching out.

511
00:36:35,780 --> 00:36:39,980
But the process was too slow.
Had to be accelerated.

512
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:45,260
You should never have given me
access to the controls, Mr Halpen.
I lowered the barrier to its minimum.

513
00:36:45,260 --> 00:36:47,899
Friends Of The Ood, sir.

514
00:36:47,899 --> 00:36:51,700
It's taken me ten years
to infiltrate the company.

515
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:54,419
And I succeeded.

516
00:36:54,419 --> 00:36:57,780
Yes. Yes, you did.

517
00:36:59,579 --> 00:37:02,179
Aargh!

518
00:37:14,019 --> 00:37:16,619
You... murdered him!

519
00:37:16,619 --> 00:37:18,899
Very observant, Ginger.

520
00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:22,619
Now, then...

521
00:37:22,619 --> 00:37:25,659
can't say I've ever shot
anyone before.

522
00:37:25,659 --> 00:37:27,820
Can't say I'm gonna like it.

523
00:37:27,820 --> 00:37:33,580
But it's not exactly a normal day,
is it? Still...

524
00:37:33,580 --> 00:37:36,419
Would you like a drink, sir?

525
00:37:36,419 --> 00:37:39,860
I think hair loss is the least
of my problems right now, thanks.

526
00:37:39,860 --> 00:37:45,620
Please have a drink, sir. If... If
you're going to stand in their way,

527
00:37:45,620 --> 00:37:48,299
I'll shoot you too.

528
00:37:48,299 --> 00:37:50,219
Please have a drink, sir.

529
00:37:52,899 --> 00:37:56,700
Have... Have you... poisoned me?

530
00:37:56,700 --> 00:38:00,899
Natural Ood must never kill, sir.
What is that stuff?

531
00:38:00,899 --> 00:38:05,340
Ood-graft suspended
in a biological compound, sir.
What the hell does THAT mean?!

532
00:38:05,340 --> 00:38:08,259
Oh, dear... Tell me!

533
00:38:08,259 --> 00:38:12,659
Funny thing, the subconscious.
Takes all sorts of shapes.

534
00:38:12,659 --> 00:38:16,300
It came out in the
red-eye as revenge.
Came out in the rabid Ood as anger.

535
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:19,499
And then there was patience.

536
00:38:20,539 --> 00:38:26,019
All that intelligence and mercy,
focused on Ood Sigma.

537
00:38:26,019 --> 00:38:28,820
How's that hair loss, Mr Halpen?

538
00:38:34,299 --> 00:38:36,820
What have you done?

539
00:38:36,820 --> 00:38:41,059
Oh, they've been preparing you for a
very long time.

540
00:38:41,059 --> 00:38:45,419
Now you're standing next to the Ood
Brain. Mr Halpen, can you hear it?

541
00:38:45,419 --> 00:38:46,939
Listen...

542
00:38:46,939 --> 00:38:48,940
EERIE SINGING

543
00:38:52,019 --> 00:38:54,819
What have you...?

544
00:38:54,819 --> 00:38:57,580
I'm...not...!

545
00:39:06,860 --> 00:39:08,860
HE DROPS GUN

546
00:39:33,660 --> 00:39:38,659
They... They turned him
into an Ood?!

547
00:39:41,020 --> 00:39:42,980
He's an Ood.

548
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:44,459
I noticed.

549
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:55,619
He has become Oodkind.

550
00:39:55,619 --> 00:39:57,620
And we will take care of him.

551
00:40:00,980 --> 00:40:05,060
It's weird,
being with you, I can't tell what's
right and what's wrong any more.

552
00:40:05,060 --> 00:40:09,059
It's better that way.
People who know for certain
tend to be like Mr Halpen.

553
00:40:09,059 --> 00:40:11,540
BEEPING
Ooh!

554
00:40:11,540 --> 00:40:14,060
That's better. And now...

555
00:40:14,060 --> 00:40:17,859
Sigma, would you allow me the honour?

556
00:40:17,859 --> 00:40:20,579
It is yours, Doctor. Oh, yes!

557
00:40:20,579 --> 00:40:22,420
Stifled for 200 years.

558
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:27,099
But not any more. The circle
is broken, the Ood can sing.

559
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:35,180
JOYOUS SINGING

560
00:40:37,859 --> 00:40:39,299
I can hear it!

561
00:40:59,740 --> 00:41:02,579
SINGING CONTINUES

562
00:41:14,420 --> 00:41:16,780
The message has gone out.

563
00:41:16,780 --> 00:41:23,020
That song resonated across the
galaxies, everyone heard it.

564
00:41:23,020 --> 00:41:25,300
The rockets are bringing them back,

565
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:28,100
the Ood are coming home.

566
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:29,940
We thank you, Doctor-Donna.

567
00:41:29,940 --> 00:41:31,579
Friends of Oodkind.

568
00:41:31,579 --> 00:41:34,379
And what of you now, will you stay?

569
00:41:34,379 --> 00:41:36,220
There is room in the song for you.

570
00:41:36,220 --> 00:41:37,859
Oh, I've...

571
00:41:37,859 --> 00:41:40,259
sort of got a song of my own, thanks.

572
00:41:40,259 --> 00:41:43,619
I think your song must end soon.

573
00:41:43,619 --> 00:41:47,779
Meaning? Every song must end.

574
00:41:47,779 --> 00:41:49,780
Yeah.

575
00:41:49,780 --> 00:41:52,419
Erm, what about you?

576
00:41:52,419 --> 00:41:54,780
You still want to go home? No.

577
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:56,579
Definitely not.

578
00:41:56,579 --> 00:42:01,220
Then, we'll be off.
Take this song with you. We will.

579
00:42:01,220 --> 00:42:02,860
Always.

580
00:42:02,860 --> 00:42:06,340
And know this, Doctor-Donna.
You will never be forgotten.

581
00:42:06,340 --> 00:42:09,259
Our children will sing
of the Doctor-Donna,

582
00:42:09,259 --> 00:42:16,059
and our children's children,
and the wind and the ice and the
snow will carry your names, forever.

583
00:42:34,140 --> 00:42:37,059
Doctor, it's Martha,

584
00:42:37,059 --> 00:42:39,580
and I'm bringing you back to Earth.

585
00:42:39,580 --> 00:42:42,619
Yesterday 52 people died
in identical circumstances,

586
00:42:42,619 --> 00:42:45,019
right across the world
in 11 different timezones.

587
00:42:45,019 --> 00:42:46,739
And you think ATMOS is alien?

588
00:42:46,739 --> 00:42:48,980
It's our job to investigate
that possibility.

589
00:42:48,980 --> 00:42:52,780
Who are you? I am General Staal
of the Tenth Sontaran Battle Fleet.

590
00:42:52,780 --> 00:42:56,260
We have an intruder!
Operation Blue Sky is go go go!

591
00:42:56,260 --> 00:42:58,900
Is that what you did to her?
Turn her into a soldier?

592
00:42:58,900 --> 00:43:01,460
What is that?! Sontaron!

593
00:43:01,460 --> 00:43:03,739
Stare into the face of death!
