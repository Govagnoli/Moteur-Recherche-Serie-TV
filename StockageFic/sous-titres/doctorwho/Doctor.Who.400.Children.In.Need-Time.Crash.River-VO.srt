1
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:49,000
- Oh, excuse me.
- So sorry.

2
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:53,200
What?

3
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:54,500
What?

4
00:00:55,150 --> 00:00:56,317
What?

5
00:00:57,318 --> 00:01:00,818
Subbed by Corax

6
00:01:01,019 --> 00:01:05,519
°.° www.SubCentral.de °.°

7
00:01:25,207 --> 00:01:26,515
Who're you?

8
00:01:26,816 --> 00:01:29,200
Oh, brilliant!

9
00:01:29,216 --> 00:01:30,116
I mean, don't get me wrong.

10
00:01:30,117 --> 00:01:33,217
Big emergency, universe goes bang
in five minutes, but brilliant.

11
00:01:33,218 --> 00:01:35,218
I'm the Doctor.
Who are you?

12
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:37,540
Yes, you are.
You are the Doctor.

13
00:01:37,541 --> 00:01:40,829
- Yes, i am. I'm the Doctor.
- Oh, good for you, Doctor.

14
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:42,520
Good for brilliant old you.

15
00:01:42,531 --> 00:01:44,531
Is there something wrong with you?

16
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:48,130
Oh! There it goes! The frowny face!
I remember that one.

17
00:01:48,331 --> 00:01:49,531
Mind you,

18
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:51,702
Bit saggier than it ought to be.
Hair's a bit greyer. That's 'cause of me, though.

19
00:01:53,203 --> 00:01:54,952
Two of us together has
shorted out the time differential.

20
00:01:54,953 --> 00:01:56,912
It should all snap back in place
when we get you home.

21
00:01:56,923 --> 00:02:00,753
Be able to close that coat again.
But nevermind that! Look at you!

22
00:02:00,819 --> 00:02:05,595
The hat, the coat, the cricket-y cricket stuff...
the stick of celery. Yeah.

23
00:02:06,003 --> 00:02:07,002
Brave choice, celery.

24
00:02:07,005 --> 00:02:09,600
But fair play to you, not a lot of men
can pull off a decorative vegetable.

25
00:02:09,603 --> 00:02:11,230
Shut up!

26
00:02:12,175 --> 00:02:13,974
There is something very wrong with my TARDIS

27
00:02:13,975 --> 00:02:16,375
and I've got to do something about it
verry, verry quickly.

28
00:02:16,425 --> 00:02:17,675
And it would help,

29
00:02:17,676 --> 00:02:18,676
it really would help, if there wasn't
some skinny idiot ranting in my face

30
00:02:21,776 --> 00:02:24,926
about every single thing
that happens to be in front of him.

31
00:02:25,327 --> 00:02:26,927
Oh, okay. Sorry...

32
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:28,256
... Doctor.

33
00:02:28,607 --> 00:02:29,857
Thank you.

34
00:02:30,007 --> 00:02:32,107
- Oh, the back of our head!
- What?

35
00:02:32,305 --> 00:02:33,060
Sorry, sorry.

36
00:02:33,061 --> 00:02:35,285
It's not something you see every day, is it.
The back of your own head.

37
00:02:35,309 --> 00:02:40,265
Mind you, I can see why you wear a hat. I don't
want to seem vain, but could you keep that on?

38
00:02:40,866 --> 00:02:44,966
What have you done to my TARDIS?
You've changed the desktop theme, haven't you?

39
00:02:45,322 --> 00:02:49,457
What's this one? Coral?
It's worse than the leopard skin.

40
00:02:49,558 --> 00:02:52,358
Oh, now they come.
The brainy specs!

41
00:02:52,659 --> 00:02:55,059
You don't even need them,
you just think they make you look a bit clever.

42
00:02:56,758 --> 00:03:01,058
That's an alert. Level 5!
Indicating a temporal collision!

43
00:03:01,736 --> 00:03:07,237
It's like two TARDISes have merged,
but there's definitely only one TARDIS present.

44
00:03:08,715 --> 00:03:11,914
It looks like two time zones
at war in the heart of the TARDIS.

45
00:03:13,314 --> 00:03:14,896
That's a paradox.

46
00:03:15,181 --> 00:03:18,251
Could blow a hole in the
space-time continuum the size of...

47
00:03:19,969 --> 00:03:23,053
Well, actually,
the exact size of... Belgium.

48
00:03:23,754 --> 00:03:25,750
That's a bit undramatic, isn't it.
Belgium?

49
00:03:25,755 --> 00:03:27,455
- Need this?
- Nah, I'm fine.

50
00:03:27,531 --> 00:03:30,407
Oh, no, of course, you mostly
went hand-free didn't you?

51
00:03:30,408 --> 00:03:31,752
Like, "Hey, I'm the Doctor.

52
00:03:31,753 --> 00:03:34,124
I can save the universe
using a kettle and some string.

53
00:03:34,125 --> 00:03:36,225
And look at me.
I'm wearing a vegetable."

54
00:03:37,906 --> 00:03:40,200
- Who are you?
- Take a look.

55
00:03:42,095 --> 00:03:44,595
- Oh. Oh, no.
- Oh, yes...

56
00:03:44,712 --> 00:03:48,270
- You're...
- Here it comes. Yeah, yeah, I am.

57
00:03:48,571 --> 00:03:50,271
- A fan.
- Yeah.

58
00:03:50,572 --> 00:03:52,472
- What?
- Level 10 now.

59
00:03:52,473 --> 00:03:54,673
This is bad.
Two minutes to Belgium.

60
00:03:54,993 --> 00:03:57,629
What d'you mean, a fan?
I'm not just a fan. I'm you!

61
00:03:57,660 --> 00:03:59,987
Okay, you're my biggest fan.

62
00:04:00,288 --> 00:04:03,187
Look, ist perfectly understandable.
I go zooming around space and time,

63
00:04:03,188 --> 00:04:05,408
saving planets, fighting monsters,
an being,

64
00:04:05,409 --> 00:04:07,607
well, let's be honest,
pretty sort of marvellous.

65
00:04:07,608 --> 00:04:09,626
So naturally, now and then,
people notice me.

66
00:04:09,627 --> 00:04:11,627
Start up their litte groups.

67
00:04:11,737 --> 00:04:13,327
That L.I.N.D.A. lot.

68
00:04:13,927 --> 00:04:15,727
Are you one of them?

69
00:04:16,528 --> 00:04:18,228
How did you get in here?

70
00:04:18,328 --> 00:04:19,970
Can't have you lot knowing where I live.

71
00:04:19,972 --> 00:04:22,186
Listen to me.
I'm you, I'm you with a new face!

72
00:04:22,187 --> 00:04:25,587
Check out this bone structure, Doctor,
cos one day, you're gonna be shaving it.

73
00:04:27,137 --> 00:04:28,567
The cloister bell.

74
00:04:29,168 --> 00:04:30,668
Yeah, right on time. That's my cue.

75
00:04:30,669 --> 00:04:31,639
In less than a minute,

76
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:35,790
we're gonna detonate a black hole
strong enough to swallow the entire universe!

77
00:04:35,793 --> 00:04:37,522
Yeah.
That's my fault, actually.

78
00:04:37,548 --> 00:04:39,855
I was rebuilding the TARDIS,
forgot to put the shields back up.

79
00:04:39,956 --> 00:04:41,656
Your TARDIS and my TARDIS, well.
The same TARDIS,

80
00:04:41,657 --> 00:04:44,455
different points in it's own time stream,
collided and there you go.

81
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:45,659
End of the universe, butterfingers.

82
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:48,411
But don't worry.
I know exactly how this all works out. Watch.

83
00:04:48,812 --> 00:04:50,412
Venting the thermo-buffer.

84
00:04:50,813 --> 00:04:52,913
Flooring the helmic regulator.

85
00:04:53,014 --> 00:04:55,910
And just to finish off,
let's fry those Zyton crystals.

86
00:04:55,913 --> 00:04:57,713
- You'll blow up the TARDIS.
- Only way I have.

87
00:04:57,716 --> 00:04:59,979
- Who told you that?
- You told me that.

88
00:05:09,104 --> 00:05:13,163
Supernova and blackhole
at the exact same instant.

89
00:05:13,164 --> 00:05:14,891
Explosion cancels out implosion.

90
00:05:14,892 --> 00:05:16,692
Matter remains constant.

91
00:05:17,065 --> 00:05:19,077
Brilliant.
Far too brilliant.

92
00:05:19,378 --> 00:05:22,078
I've never met anyone else
who cold fly the TARDIS like that.

93
00:05:22,079 --> 00:05:23,178
Sorry, mate. You still haven't.

94
00:05:23,179 --> 00:05:25,779
You didn't have time to work all that out.
Even I couldn't do it.

95
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:28,680
I didn't work it out.
I didn't have to.

96
00:05:30,381 --> 00:05:31,681
You remembered.

97
00:05:31,982 --> 00:05:33,682
Because you will remember.

98
00:05:34,041 --> 00:05:37,996
You rememberered being me
watching you doing that.

99
00:05:38,997 --> 00:05:42,897
You only knew what to do because...
I saw do it.

100
00:05:42,991 --> 00:05:44,102
Wibby-wobbly...

101
00:05:44,103 --> 00:05:46,103
- timey-wimey.
- timey-wimey.

102
00:05:51,504 --> 00:05:53,404
Back to long ago.
Where are you now?

103
00:05:53,905 --> 00:05:54,905
Nyssa and Tegan?

104
00:05:54,906 --> 00:05:57,706
Cybermen and Mara and Time Lord
in funny hats and the Master?

105
00:05:57,707 --> 00:06:01,007
Oh, he just showed up again, same as ever.
Oh, no. Really?

106
00:06:01,708 --> 00:06:03,408
Does he still have that rubbisch beard?

107
00:06:03,509 --> 00:06:06,109
No, no beard this time.
Well, a wife.

108
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:09,110
Oh oh!

109
00:06:09,411 --> 00:06:11,311
I seem to be off.

110
00:06:11,612 --> 00:06:13,112
What can I say?

111
00:06:13,713 --> 00:06:16,713
- Thank you, Doctor.
- Thank you.

112
00:06:17,014 --> 00:06:18,314
I'm verry welcome.

113
00:06:21,715 --> 00:06:23,215
You know...

114
00:06:24,416 --> 00:06:26,016
I love being you.

115
00:06:26,817 --> 00:06:28,417
Back when I first started
at the verry beginning,

116
00:06:28,418 --> 00:06:30,318
I was always trying to be old
and grumpy and important,

117
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:31,999
like you do when you're young.

118
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:34,300
And then I was you...

119
00:06:34,801 --> 00:06:38,301
It was all dashing about and playing cricket
and my voice going all suerky when I shouted.

120
00:06:38,302 --> 00:06:41,102
I still do that, the voice thing.
I got that from you.

121
00:06:41,503 --> 00:06:44,383
Oh, and the trainers.
And...

122
00:06:46,607 --> 00:06:47,907
snap.

123
00:06:48,808 --> 00:06:50,508
Cos you know what, Doctor?

124
00:06:51,808 --> 00:06:53,808
You were my Doctor.

125
00:06:57,209 --> 00:06:58,909
To days to come.

126
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:01,938
All my love to long ago.

127
00:07:10,539 --> 00:07:13,539
Oh, Doctor, remember to put your shields up.

128
00:07:22,846 --> 00:07:24,073
What?

129
00:07:26,174 --> 00:07:27,274
What?

130
00:07:34,475 --> 00:07:35,475
What?

131
00:07:37,176 --> 00:07:38,976
Want more Doctor Who?
