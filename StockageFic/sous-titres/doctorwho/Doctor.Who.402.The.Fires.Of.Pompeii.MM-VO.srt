1
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:07,580
Ancient Rome.

2
00:00:11,412 --> 00:00:12,463
Well, not to them, obviously.

3
00:00:12,498 --> 00:00:15,282
To all intents and purposes,
right now, this is Brand New Rome.

4
00:00:16,133 --> 00:00:17,649
Oh, my God, it's...

5
00:00:18,732 --> 00:00:20,288
It's so Roman!

6
00:00:21,552 --> 00:00:22,956
This is fantastic.

7
00:00:26,357 --> 00:00:27,808
I'm here,

8
00:00:28,687 --> 00:00:31,951
in Rome,
Donna Noble, in Rome.

9
00:00:32,807 --> 00:00:34,350
This isjust weird.

10
00:00:34,561 --> 00:00:36,322
- I mean, everyone here's dead
- Well,

11
00:00:36,898 --> 00:00:38,105
don't tell THEM that.

12
00:00:38,685 --> 00:00:39,633
Hold on a minute,

13
00:00:40,231 --> 00:00:41,850
that sign over there's in English.

14
00:00:42,369 --> 00:00:43,899
Are you having me on, are we in Epcot?

15
00:00:43,934 --> 00:00:46,029
No,no no, it's TARDIS
translation circuits,

16
00:00:46,145 --> 00:00:48,030
it looks like English
Speech as well,

17
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:50,306
- you're talking Latin right now
- Seriously?

18
00:00:50,567 --> 00:00:52,496
- Ijust said 'seriously'in Latin.
- Yeah.

19
00:00:53,918 --> 00:00:56,351
What if I said something in actual Latin?

20
00:00:57,039 --> 00:00:59,768
Like, 'Veni, vidi, vici'? My dad said
that coming back from the football.

21
00:00:59,803 --> 00:01:03,197
Ifl said, 'Veni, vidi, vici' to that
lot, what would it sound like?

22
00:01:03,232 --> 00:01:05,420
I'm not sure.You do think of
difficult questions.

23
00:01:06,013 --> 00:01:07,082
I'm gonna try it.

24
00:01:09,137 --> 00:01:11,526
Afternoon, sweetheart,
what can I get you, my love?

25
00:01:12,112 --> 00:01:14,341
Erm... Veni, vidi, vici.

26
00:01:15,033 --> 00:01:15,991
Ah? Sorry?

27
00:01:17,204 --> 00:01:21,407
Me-no-speak-Celtic.
No-can-do, missy.

28
00:01:21,932 --> 00:01:23,012
Yeah.

29
00:01:24,493 --> 00:01:26,446
- How's he mean, Celtic?
- Welsh

30
00:01:26,775 --> 00:01:27,749
You sound Welsh.

31
00:01:28,516 --> 00:01:29,623
There we are, learnt something, hm?

32
00:01:35,885 --> 00:01:37,520
Don't our clothes look a bit odd?

33
00:01:38,022 --> 00:01:39,572
Naaah. Ancient Rome, anything goes.

34
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:41,671
It's like Soho, but bigger.

35
00:01:42,272 --> 00:01:43,527
- Have you been here before, then?
- Mm.

36
00:01:44,063 --> 00:01:45,129
Ages ago.

37
00:01:45,177 --> 00:01:47,726
And that fire had nothing to do with me.

38
00:01:48,267 --> 00:01:50,943
Well... a bit. But I haven't got
the chance to look around properly.

39
00:01:51,462 --> 00:01:53,627
The Colosseum. The Pantheon.

40
00:01:53,659 --> 00:01:54,877
The Circus Maximus...

41
00:01:55,674 --> 00:01:57,753
You'd expect them to be looming by now.

42
00:01:58,654 --> 00:01:59,565
Where is everything?

43
00:02:01,215 --> 00:02:02,305
Try this one.

44
00:02:14,547 --> 00:02:15,729
I'm not expert,

45
00:02:17,021 --> 00:02:18,912
but there's SEVEN hills of Rome,
aren't there?

46
00:02:20,051 --> 00:02:21,246
How come they've only got one?

47
00:02:23,442 --> 00:02:24,414
Here we go again!

48
00:02:28,929 --> 00:02:30,008
Wait a minute...

49
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:32,133
One mountain.

50
00:02:32,433 --> 00:02:33,854
With smoke.

51
00:02:34,069 --> 00:02:36,020
- Which makes this...
- Pompeii.

52
00:02:36,947 --> 00:02:38,260
We're in Pompeii

53
00:02:39,732 --> 00:02:41,268
And it's volcano day.

54
00:03:05,508 --> 00:03:07,508

56
00:03:29,091 --> 00:03:32,115
I beg audience with the High
Priestess ofthe Sibylline.

57
00:03:32,121 --> 00:03:34,538
The High Priestess cannot be seen.

58
00:03:41,156 --> 00:03:43,895
- What would you tell her, sister?
- It has come.

59
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:46,223
As foretold in the prophecy.

60
00:03:46,714 --> 00:03:47,813
The box.

61
00:03:48,109 --> 00:03:49,528
The blue box.

62
00:04:05,349 --> 00:04:06,888
You're kidding.

63
00:04:07,076 --> 00:04:09,813
- You're not telling me the TARDIS has gone?
- OK.

64
00:04:10,362 --> 00:04:11,406
Where is it, then?

65
00:04:12,024 --> 00:04:13,779
You told me not to tell you.

66
00:04:14,744 --> 00:04:16,492
-0i. Don't get clever in Latin.
Hold on.

67
00:04:18,703 --> 00:04:20,123
'Scuse me, 'scuse me,

68
00:04:20,158 --> 00:04:22,423
there was a box, big blue box,
big blue wooden box,

69
00:04:22,441 --> 00:04:24,185
over there,
where is it gonne?

70
00:04:24,732 --> 00:04:27,119
- I sold it, didn't I?
- But...

71
00:04:27,925 --> 00:04:30,365
- It wasn't yours to sell!
- It was on my patch, weren't it?

72
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,124
I got 15 sesterce for it, lovely jubbly.

73
00:04:33,159 --> 00:04:35,848
- Who did you sell it to?
- Old Caecilius. Look,

74
00:04:36,339 --> 00:04:38,565
if you want to argue, why don't
you take it out with him?

75
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,792
He's on Foss Street,
big villa, can't miss it.

76
00:04:40,827 --> 00:04:41,884
Thanks.

77
00:04:43,314 --> 00:04:44,783
What did he buy a big
blue wooden box for?

78
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:46,756
Modern art!

79
00:04:47,175 --> 00:04:49,136
Out ofthe way, thafs it.

80
00:04:49,952 --> 00:04:53,420
Oh, Rhombus, I'm a little bit peckish,
get me some ants in honey, good lad.

81
00:04:55,262 --> 00:04:56,458
Ooh, maybe a dormouse?

82
00:05:00,656 --> 00:05:01,705
What d'you think?

83
00:05:01,758 --> 00:05:03,173
You call it modern art.

84
00:05:03,248 --> 00:05:05,532
I call it a blooming great waste of space.

85
00:05:05,558 --> 00:05:07,413
But we're going up in the world, my love.

86
00:05:07,582 --> 00:05:10,475
Lucius Dextrus himself is coming here.
This afternoon.

87
00:05:10,607 --> 00:05:12,569
What with that, and our Evelina
about to be elevated...

88
00:05:12,604 --> 00:05:14,165
Oh, don't go on about it, Dad!

89
00:05:14,401 --> 00:05:17,632
If we'd moved to Rome, as I said,
she could have been a Vestal Virgin.

90
00:05:17,667 --> 00:05:20,813
- Someone mention Vestal Virgins?
- Quintus, don't be so rude.

91
00:05:20,848 --> 00:05:22,591
You apologise to the household gods!

92
00:05:22,642 --> 00:05:24,632
- Get off.
- Apologise, right now!

93
00:05:24,667 --> 00:05:26,249
The gods are always watching.

94
00:05:30,063 --> 00:05:31,316
Positions!

95
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:49,423
There, now you've made the Heavens angry.

96
00:05:49,458 --> 00:05:50,703
Just say sorry.

97
00:05:52,204 --> 00:05:54,628
I tell you, Caecilius,
that boy will come to no good.

98
00:05:55,581 --> 00:05:57,574
Sorry, household gods.

99
00:05:57,609 --> 00:05:59,979
So where were you last night?
Down the thermopolium, I bet?

100
00:06:00,014 --> 00:06:02,750
Cavorting with Etruscans and Christians and all sorts.

101
00:06:02,785 --> 00:06:05,486
How's your head, sunshine?
How's your head?

102
00:06:05,521 --> 00:06:07,259
All right, Dad, give us a break!

103
00:06:07,294 --> 00:06:09,202
You want to smarten yourself up,
Quintus.

104
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:11,044
Before Lucius Dextrus gets here.

105
00:06:11,502 --> 00:06:12,595
Look at your sister,

106
00:06:13,153 --> 00:06:15,632
she's giving us... status.

107
00:06:15,667 --> 00:06:18,184
Oh, yeah,
cos it's all about Evelina.

108
00:06:18,769 --> 00:06:22,697
She has the gift.
Be proud of your sister, for once.

109
00:06:22,732 --> 00:06:25,481
- Have you been consuming?
- Not this morning.

110
00:06:25,635 --> 00:06:28,092
Well, come on, sweetheart.
Practise!

111
00:06:28,474 --> 00:06:31,360
Oh, it's hot today,
the hypocaust is on full blast.

112
00:06:31,395 --> 00:06:32,949
The Mountain God must be happy.

113
00:06:33,217 --> 00:06:35,903
Breathe deeply.
Remember what the Sisterhood said.

114
00:06:39,188 --> 00:06:41,708
- It hurts.
- Oh, my love, is it too hot?

115
00:06:42,437 --> 00:06:44,383
Sometimes, in the smoke...

116
00:06:45,551 --> 00:06:48,644
- I see the most terrible things.
- Like what?

117
00:06:50,264 --> 00:06:51,495
A face.

118
00:06:53,058 --> 00:06:54,516
A face of stone.

119
00:06:54,803 --> 00:06:57,044
It'll make sense.
One day.

120
00:06:57,079 --> 00:06:58,664
Sister Spurrina promised.

121
00:06:58,948 --> 00:07:02,233
The veil will be parted,
and you'll be a seer.

122
00:07:28,422 --> 00:07:29,645
Who are you?

123
00:07:32,706 --> 00:07:34,660
Ah, I've got it!
Foss Street, this way!

124
00:07:34,695 --> 00:07:36,614
No, but I found this big sort
of amphitheatre thing,

125
00:07:36,795 --> 00:07:38,565
we could gather
everyone together there,

126
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,602
then we could ring a big bell...

127
00:07:40,643 --> 00:07:42,363
- They got bells yet?
- What d'you want a bell for?

128
00:07:42,398 --> 00:07:43,416
To warn everyone.

129
00:07:43,451 --> 00:07:44,586
Start the evacuation.

130
00:07:44,875 --> 00:07:46,586
What time does Vesuvius erupt?

131
00:07:46,621 --> 00:07:48,354
It's 79AD, 23rd of August,

132
00:07:48,389 --> 00:07:50,088
which makes Volcano Day... tomorrow.

133
00:07:50,123 --> 00:07:52,281
Plenty of time
to get everyone out, easy.

134
00:07:52,287 --> 00:07:53,573
Yeah,
except we're not going to.

135
00:07:54,277 --> 00:07:56,417
But that's what you do,
Doctor, you save people!

136
00:07:56,452 --> 00:07:58,557
Not this time.
Pompeii is a fixed point in history.

137
00:07:58,592 --> 00:08:00,692
What happens, happens.
There is no stopping it.

138
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,678
- Says who?
- Says me.

139
00:08:02,713 --> 00:08:03,718
What, and you're in charge?

140
00:08:03,753 --> 00:08:04,940
TARDIS, Time Lord, yeah!

141
00:08:04,975 --> 00:08:06,128
Donna, Human, no!

142
00:08:06,187 --> 00:08:07,897
I don't need your permission!
I'm telling myself!

143
00:08:07,932 --> 00:08:09,396
You stand here announcing the end,

144
00:08:09,431 --> 00:08:11,525
they'll just think you're a mad old soothsayer!

145
00:08:11,585 --> 00:08:14,198
Now, come on. TARDIS. We are getting out of here.

146
00:08:14,615 --> 00:08:17,856
I might just have something
to say about that, spaceman!

147
00:08:17,958 --> 00:08:19,134
Oh, I bet you will!

148
00:08:29,282 --> 00:08:30,697
The tall one.

149
00:08:31,185 --> 00:08:32,918
He calls us mad.

150
00:08:33,055 --> 00:08:35,032
Then he is a stranger to Pompeii.

151
00:08:35,707 --> 00:08:37,060
Soon, he will learn.

152
00:08:37,259 --> 00:08:38,910
We have found it, Sister Spurrina.

153
00:08:39,408 --> 00:08:42,448
In the Thirteenth Book
of the Sibylline Oracles.

154
00:08:42,483 --> 00:08:43,766
The blue box.

155
00:08:44,528 --> 00:08:46,761
A temple made of wood.

156
00:08:47,021 --> 00:08:50,944
And yet, the Sibyl foretold that the box
would appear at the time of storms

157
00:08:51,019 --> 00:08:53,601
and fire and betrayal.

158
00:08:53,826 --> 00:08:55,415
Sisters!

159
00:09:04,084 --> 00:09:05,691
Reverend Mother, you should sleep.

160
00:09:05,726 --> 00:09:08,985
The Sibylline Oracles are wrong.

161
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:11,801
But we have venerated her
words for generations.

162
00:09:11,836 --> 00:09:14,264
This is a new age.

163
00:09:14,742 --> 00:09:17,443
Heed my words.

164
00:09:17,829 --> 00:09:22,173
I predict a future
of prosperity and might.

165
00:09:22,208 --> 00:09:25,410
An endless Empire of Pompeii,

166
00:09:25,836 --> 00:09:30,289
reaching out from this city
to topple Rome itself,

167
00:09:30,324 --> 00:09:34,573
and encompass the whole wide world.

168
00:09:35,382 --> 00:09:39,505
If the disciples of the blue box
defy this prophecy,

169
00:09:39,764 --> 00:09:44,764
their blood will run across
the Temple floor.

170
00:09:47,137 --> 00:09:48,796
The gods approve.

171
00:09:49,446 --> 00:09:50,770
Positions!

172
00:09:58,467 --> 00:09:59,527
There you go.

173
00:09:59,856 --> 00:10:01,534
Thank you, kind sir.

174
00:10:02,048 --> 00:10:04,807
I'm afraid business is closed for the day.
I'm expecting a visitor.

175
00:10:04,842 --> 00:10:06,784
That's me.
I'm a visitor. Hello.

176
00:10:08,523 --> 00:10:10,573
- Who are you?
- I am...

177
00:10:11,187 --> 00:10:12,109
Spartacus.

178
00:10:13,261 --> 00:10:14,268
And so am I.

179
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:15,633
Mr and Mrs Spartacus?

180
00:10:15,773 --> 00:10:17,711
- 0h, no, we're not married.
- We're not together.

181
00:10:17,773 --> 00:10:18,917
0h, brother and sister?

182
00:10:19,303 --> 00:10:21,568
Yes, ofcourse!
You look very much alike.

183
00:10:22,473 --> 00:10:23,568
- Really?
- Really?

184
00:10:23,603 --> 00:10:25,342
I'm sorry,
but I'm not open for trading.

185
00:10:25,442 --> 00:10:27,582
- And that trade would be...?
- Marble.

186
00:10:28,044 --> 00:10:29,366
Lobus Caecilius.

187
00:10:29,764 --> 00:10:32,402
Mining,
polishing and design thereof.

188
00:10:33,732 --> 00:10:36,224
- If you want marble, I'm your man.
- That's good, cos...

189
00:10:36,259 --> 00:10:37,915
I'm the marble inspector.

190
00:10:38,297 --> 00:10:40,659
By the gods of Commerce,
an inspection!

191
00:10:40,987 --> 00:10:44,695
I'm sorry, sir.
I do apologise for my son.

192
00:10:45,218 --> 00:10:46,405
This is my good wife, Metella.

193
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:49,802
- I confess, we're not prepared...
- Don't worry.

194
00:10:49,837 --> 00:10:53,165
I'm sure you've nothing to hide.
Although, frankly, THAT object...

195
00:10:53,259 --> 00:10:55,988
- looks rather like wood to me.
- I told you to get rid of it.

196
00:10:56,631 --> 00:10:58,111
I only bought it today!

197
00:10:59,599 --> 00:11:00,838
Ah, well... Caveat emptor.

198
00:11:00,884 --> 00:11:03,323
Oh, you're Celtic. There's lovely.

199
00:11:03,477 --> 00:11:07,526
I'm sure it's fine, but I might have to take
it off your hands, for a proper inspection.

200
00:11:07,561 --> 00:11:10,513
While we're here,
would you recommend a holiday, Spartacus?

201
00:11:11,265 --> 00:11:12,862
Don't know what you mean, Spartacus.

202
00:11:13,112 --> 00:11:17,058
Well, this lovely family.
Mother and father and son.

203
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:19,055
Don't you think
they should get out of town?

204
00:11:19,090 --> 00:11:21,272
- Why should we do that?
- Well, the volcano, for start.

205
00:11:21,307 --> 00:11:22,629
- What?
- The volcano.

206
00:11:22,664 --> 00:11:25,569
- The WHAT-ano?
- That great big volcano right on your doorstep...

207
00:11:25,604 --> 00:11:28,475
Oh, Spartacus, for shame, we haven't
even greeted the household gods yet.

208
00:11:29,627 --> 00:11:32,082
They don't know what it is.
Vesuvius is just a mountain to them,

209
00:11:32,117 --> 00:11:33,300
the top hasn't blown off yet.

210
00:11:33,814 --> 00:11:35,776
The Romans haven't even got a word for volcano.

211
00:11:35,964 --> 00:11:37,174
Not until tomorrow.

212
00:11:37,317 --> 00:11:38,972
Oh, great, they can learn a new word.

213
00:11:39,246 --> 00:11:41,257
- As they die.
- Donna, stop it.

214
00:11:41,766 --> 00:11:44,296
Whatever sort of kids
you've been flying round with,

215
00:11:44,436 --> 00:11:45,700
don't tell me to shut up.

216
00:11:46,009 --> 00:11:48,585
That boy, how old is he? Sixteen?

217
00:11:48,965 --> 00:11:51,556
- And tomorrow, he burns to death.
- And that's my fault?

218
00:11:51,647 --> 00:11:52,664
Right now, yes.

219
00:11:53,007 --> 00:11:56,366
Announcing Lucius Petrus Dextrus,

220
00:11:56,769 --> 00:11:59,477
Chief Augur of the City Government.

221
00:12:03,363 --> 00:12:05,909
Lucius. My pleasure, as always.

222
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,005
Quintus, stand up!

223
00:12:07,795 --> 00:12:10,721
A rare and great honour, sir,
for you to come to my house...

224
00:12:12,626 --> 00:12:16,210
The birds are flying north,
and the wind is in the west.

225
00:12:17,269 --> 00:12:18,555
Quite. Absolutely.

226
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:19,925
That's good, is it?

227
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:23,239
- Only the grain of wheat knows where it will grow.
- There now, Metella.

228
00:12:23,274 --> 00:12:26,297
- Have you ever heard SUCH wisdom?
- Never.

229
00:12:27,037 --> 00:12:28,193
It's an honour.

230
00:12:29,833 --> 00:12:32,075
Pardon me, sir, I have guests,

231
00:12:32,110 --> 00:12:34,317
this is Spartacus and... Spartacus.

232
00:12:34,586 --> 00:12:36,693
A name is but a cloud upon a summer wind.

233
00:12:36,728 --> 00:12:38,800
But the wind is felt most keenly in the dark.

234
00:12:41,129 --> 00:12:42,399
But what is the dark,

235
00:12:42,825 --> 00:12:46,925
- other than an omen ofthe sun?
- I concede that every sun must set...

236
00:12:46,997 --> 00:12:50,064
- And yet the son of the father must also rise.
- Damn.

237
00:12:51,092 --> 00:12:52,292
Very clever, sir.

238
00:12:52,826 --> 00:12:54,434
Evidently, a man of learning.

239
00:12:54,528 --> 00:12:57,111
Oh, yes. But don't mind me, don't want to disturb the status quo.

240
00:12:57,146 --> 00:12:58,232
He's Celtic.

241
00:12:58,267 --> 00:13:00,969
- We'll be off in a minute.
- I'm not going.

242
00:13:01,004 --> 00:13:02,320
It's ready, sir.

243
00:13:02,355 --> 00:13:03,637
- You've got to.
- Well, I'm not.

244
00:13:03,646 --> 00:13:05,663
The moment of revelation.

245
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:09,294
And here it is!
Exactly as you've specified.

246
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:12,863
- It pleases you, sir?
- As the rain pleases the soil.

247
00:13:12,999 --> 00:13:15,545
Oh, now that's... different.
Who designed that, then?

248
00:13:15,665 --> 00:13:17,254
My Lord Lucius was very specific.

249
00:13:17,318 --> 00:13:19,640
- Where did you get the pattern?
- On the rain and mist and wind.

250
00:13:19,732 --> 00:13:22,154
- But that looks like a circuit.
- Made of stone.

251
00:13:22,189 --> 00:13:24,576
D'you mean you just dreamt that thing up?

252
00:13:24,796 --> 00:13:26,909
That is my job.
As City Augur.

253
00:13:26,944 --> 00:13:28,188
What's that, then, like the mayor?

254
00:13:29,827 --> 00:13:32,790
Oh! You must excuse my friend.
She's from Barcelona.

255
00:13:32,825 --> 00:13:35,551
But this is an age of superstition,
of OFFICIAL superstition.

256
00:13:35,967 --> 00:13:38,431
The Augur is paid by the city
to tell the future.

257
00:13:38,978 --> 00:13:41,603
"The wind will blow from the west",
that's their Ten O'Clock News.

258
00:13:41,685 --> 00:13:43,226
They're laughing at us.

259
00:13:44,351 --> 00:13:48,050
Those two use words like tricksters,
they're mocking us.

260
00:13:48,272 --> 00:13:50,852
No, no, no.
I meant no offence.

261
00:13:50,887 --> 00:13:53,174
I'm sorry, my daughter's
been consuming the vapours.

262
00:13:53,209 --> 00:13:55,461
By the gods, mother,
what have you been doing?

263
00:13:55,988 --> 00:13:58,461
- Not now, Quintus.
- But she's sick, just look at her!

264
00:13:58,496 --> 00:14:00,973
I gather I have a rival
in this household.

265
00:14:01,099 --> 00:14:02,545
Another with the gift.

266
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:05,046
Oh, she's been promised to
the Sibylline Sisterhood.

267
00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:07,785
They say she has remarkable visions.

268
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:10,116
The prophecies of women
are limited and dull,

269
00:14:10,147 --> 00:14:13,219
only the menfolk have the capacity
for true perception.

270
00:14:13,221 --> 00:14:15,144
I'll tell you where the wind's blowing right now, mate.

271
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:19,718
The Mountain God marks your words.

272
00:14:19,759 --> 00:14:21,419
I'd be careful, if I were you.

273
00:14:21,421 --> 00:14:24,062
- Consuming the vapours, you said?
- They give me strength.

274
00:14:24,154 --> 00:14:26,667
- It doesn't look like it to me.
- Is that your opinion...

275
00:14:27,481 --> 00:14:29,358
- as a doctor?
- I beg your pardon?

276
00:14:29,393 --> 00:14:31,177
Doctor, that's your name.

277
00:14:31,555 --> 00:14:33,551
- How did you know that?
- And YOU...

278
00:14:34,972 --> 00:14:36,941
You call yourself Noble.

279
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:39,532
Now then, Evelina, don't be rude.

280
00:14:39,794 --> 00:14:41,472
No, no, no, no, let her talk.

281
00:14:41,476 --> 00:14:43,859
You both come from so far away.

282
00:14:43,894 --> 00:14:47,441
The female soothsayer is inclined
to invent all sorts of vagaries.

283
00:14:47,476 --> 00:14:49,228
0h, not this time, Lucius.

284
00:14:49,245 --> 00:14:51,374
No, I reckon
you've been out-soothsayed.

285
00:14:51,425 --> 00:14:52,685
Is that so...

286
00:14:53,581 --> 00:14:56,504
- man from Gallifrey?
- What?

287
00:14:59,516 --> 00:15:01,281
The strangest of images...

288
00:15:01,541 --> 00:15:04,199
Your home is lost in fire, is it not?

289
00:15:04,241 --> 00:15:05,185
Doctor, what are they doing?

290
00:15:05,398 --> 00:15:09,921
- And you, daughter of... London.
- How does he know that?

291
00:15:10,030 --> 00:15:11,785
This is the gift of Pompeii.

292
00:15:12,081 --> 00:15:14,206
Every single oracle tells the truth.

293
00:15:14,241 --> 00:15:16,331
- That's impossible.
- Doctor...

294
00:15:17,641 --> 00:15:18,988
she is returning.

295
00:15:20,633 --> 00:15:21,805
Who is? Who's she?

296
00:15:21,857 --> 00:15:24,290
And you, daughter of London...

297
00:15:25,894 --> 00:15:27,872
there is something on your back.

298
00:15:29,687 --> 00:15:30,666
What's that mean?

299
00:15:30,701 --> 00:15:33,029
Even the word 'doctor' is false.

300
00:15:33,332 --> 00:15:34,945
Your real name is hidden.

301
00:15:36,152 --> 00:15:40,585
It burns in the stars, in the Cascade of Medusa herself.

302
00:15:41,219 --> 00:15:42,901
You are a Lord, sir.

303
00:15:44,486 --> 00:15:46,931
A Lord of Time.

304
00:15:51,023 --> 00:15:52,197
Evelina!

305
00:15:56,178 --> 00:15:57,746
She didn't mean to be rude,

306
00:15:58,892 --> 00:16:00,559
she's ever such a good girl.

307
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,222
But when the gods speak through her...

308
00:16:04,768 --> 00:16:07,240
- What's wrong with her arm?
- An irritation of the skin.

309
00:16:07,476 --> 00:16:09,247
She never complains, bless her.

310
00:16:09,591 --> 00:16:11,231
We bathe it in olive oil every night.

311
00:16:11,266 --> 00:16:12,275
What is it?

312
00:16:14,070 --> 00:16:16,459
Evelina said you'd come from far away.

313
00:16:17,752 --> 00:16:20,398
Please, have you ever seen anything like it?

314
00:16:30,022 --> 00:16:31,312
It's stone.

315
00:16:41,112 --> 00:16:42,941
- Different sort of hypocaust.
- Oh, yes.

316
00:16:42,976 --> 00:16:44,531
We're very advanced in Pompeii.

317
00:16:44,566 --> 00:16:47,384
In Rome, they're still using
the old wood-burning furnaces.

318
00:16:47,419 --> 00:16:50,625
But we've got hot springs, leading from Vesuvius itself.

319
00:16:50,821 --> 00:16:52,991
- Who thought of that?
- The soothsayers.

320
00:16:53,433 --> 00:16:55,532
After the great earthquake,
17 years ago.

321
00:16:55,991 --> 00:16:57,174
An awful lot of damage.

322
00:16:58,123 --> 00:16:59,514
But we rebuilt.

323
00:16:59,636 --> 00:17:01,044
Didn't you think of moving away?

324
00:17:01,463 --> 00:17:03,173
No, then again, San Francisco...

325
00:17:03,208 --> 00:17:05,930
That's a little restaurant in...
Naples, isn't it?

326
00:17:05,945 --> 00:17:07,988
- What's that noise?
- Don't know.

327
00:17:08,301 --> 00:17:09,389
Happens all the time.

328
00:17:10,243 --> 00:17:12,613
They say the gods of the Underworld
are stirring.

329
00:17:14,388 --> 00:17:16,170
But after the earthquake,
let me guess...

330
00:17:16,330 --> 00:17:19,757
- is that when the soothsayers started making sense?
- Oh, yes, very much so.

331
00:17:20,418 --> 00:17:23,182
I mean, they'd always been,
shall we say, imprecise?

332
00:17:23,781 --> 00:17:26,912
But then the soothsayers, the augurs,
the haruspex, all of them,

333
00:17:26,947 --> 00:17:28,691
they saw the truth,
again and again.

334
00:17:28,726 --> 00:17:29,730
It's quite amazing.

335
00:17:30,363 --> 00:17:33,185
They predict crops and rainfall with absolute precision.

336
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:34,717
Have they said anything about tomorrow?

337
00:17:34,833 --> 00:17:35,907
No.

338
00:17:36,405 --> 00:17:37,858
Why, should they?
Why d'you ask?

339
00:17:37,893 --> 00:17:39,765
No, no, no reason.
Just asking.

340
00:17:39,987 --> 00:17:42,911
But the soothsayers,
they all consume the vapours, yeah?

341
00:17:42,946 --> 00:17:44,147
That's how they see.

342
00:17:45,310 --> 00:17:46,844
Ipso facto...

343
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:49,531
Look you. ..

344
00:17:50,634 --> 00:17:52,980
- They're all consuming this.
- Dust?

345
00:17:53,354 --> 00:17:54,811
Tiny particles of rock.

346
00:18:00,430 --> 00:18:02,247
They're breathing in Vesuvius.

347
00:18:06,471 --> 00:18:07,724
Quintus, me old son.

348
00:18:07,759 --> 00:18:11,521
This Lucius Petrus Dextrus,
where does he live?

349
00:18:11,556 --> 00:18:12,879
It's nothing to do with me.

350
00:18:13,716 --> 00:18:14,716
Let me try again.

351
00:18:15,203 --> 00:18:18,504
This Lucius Petrus Dextrus...

352
00:18:21,066 --> 00:18:21,977
Where does he live?

353
00:18:38,082 --> 00:18:39,221
Don't tell my dad.

354
00:18:42,222 --> 00:18:43,524
Only if you don't tell mine.

355
00:18:48,363 --> 00:18:49,535
Pass me that torch.

356
00:19:07,162 --> 00:19:08,132
The liar!

357
00:19:08,309 --> 00:19:09,822
He told my father
it was the only one.

358
00:19:10,616 --> 00:19:13,224
Well, plenty of marble
merchants in this town.

359
00:19:13,684 --> 00:19:16,764
Tell them all the same,
get all the components from different places,

360
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:18,347
so no-one can see what it is.

361
00:19:18,448 --> 00:19:20,019
- Which is what?
- The future.

362
00:19:20,089 --> 00:19:22,437
Doctor, we are building the future.

363
00:19:22,632 --> 00:19:24,489
As dictated by the gods.

364
00:19:27,699 --> 00:19:30,494
You're not supposed to laugh.
Thanks for that.

365
00:19:31,159 --> 00:19:32,222
What d'you think?

366
00:19:33,098 --> 00:19:34,269
The Goddess Venus.

367
00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:35,815
That's sacrilege.

368
00:19:36,709 --> 00:19:38,147
Nice to see you laugh, though.

369
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:43,653
What d'you do in old Pompeii,
then, girls of your age?

370
00:19:43,866 --> 00:19:47,373
You got... mates?
D'you go hanging about round the shops?

371
00:19:47,821 --> 00:19:49,041
TK Maximus?

372
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:52,298
I am promised to
the Sisterhood for life.

373
00:19:53,234 --> 00:19:56,039
- D'you get any choice in that?
- It's not my decision.

374
00:19:56,091 --> 00:19:58,437
The Sisters chose for me.
I have the gift of sight.

375
00:19:59,193 --> 00:20:00,261
Then...

376
00:20:01,028 --> 00:20:03,535
- What can you see happening tomorrow?
- Is tomorrow special?

377
00:20:04,346 --> 00:20:05,531
You tell me.

378
00:20:06,298 --> 00:20:07,474
What do you see?

379
00:20:10,573 --> 00:20:12,661
The sun will rise. The sun will set.

380
00:20:12,953 --> 00:20:14,154
Nothing special at all.

381
00:20:16,399 --> 00:20:17,441
Look,

382
00:20:18,247 --> 00:20:20,567
don't tell the Doctor
I said anything cos he'll kill me,

383
00:20:20,685 --> 00:20:22,378
but I've got a prophecy too.

384
00:20:24,701 --> 00:20:27,212
Evelina, I'm sorry,
but you've got to hear me out.

385
00:20:27,247 --> 00:20:29,604
- Sisters!
- Evelina, can you hear me?

386
00:20:30,406 --> 00:20:31,490
Listen...

387
00:20:34,064 --> 00:20:35,659
There is only one prophecy.

388
00:20:35,914 --> 00:20:38,826
But everything I'm about to say to you is true. I swear.

389
00:20:39,130 --> 00:20:40,349
just listen to me.

390
00:20:40,861 --> 00:20:44,038
Tomorrow,
that mountain is gonna explode.

391
00:20:44,481 --> 00:20:45,897
Evelina, please listen.

392
00:20:46,584 --> 00:20:48,757
The air is gonna fill with ash and rocks,

393
00:20:48,792 --> 00:20:49,995
tons and tons of it,

394
00:20:50,547 --> 00:20:53,412
and this whole town is gonna get buried.
That's not true.

395
00:20:53,845 --> 00:20:54,914
I'm sorry.

396
00:20:55,492 --> 00:20:56,801
I'm really sorry.

397
00:20:57,984 --> 00:21:00,261
- But everyone's going to die.
- A new prophecy!

398
00:21:00,296 --> 00:21:02,632
Impossible.
There is only one.

399
00:21:02,667 --> 00:21:05,583
Even if you don't believe me, tell your family to get out of town.

400
00:21:05,662 --> 00:21:08,623
Just for one day, just for tomorrow.
But you've got to get out.

401
00:21:08,772 --> 00:21:11,629
- You've got to leave Pompeii!
- This is false prophecy.

402
00:21:17,102 --> 00:21:18,220
The noblewoman.

403
00:21:18,255 --> 00:21:21,548
She spoke of a new prophecy,
the fall of Pompeii.

404
00:21:21,624 --> 00:21:23,629
Pompeii will last forever.

405
00:21:23,631 --> 00:21:27,616
- Then what must we do?
- The False Prophet must die.

406
00:21:28,148 --> 00:21:29,615
Sacrifice her!

407
00:21:31,354 --> 00:21:33,740
Put this one... there.

408
00:21:35,069 --> 00:21:36,061
This one...

409
00:21:38,094 --> 00:21:39,344
there.

410
00:21:40,179 --> 00:21:42,621
Er, keep that one upside down,
what have you got?

411
00:21:42,656 --> 00:21:45,028
- Enlighten me.
- What, the soothsayer doesn't know?

412
00:21:45,063 --> 00:21:47,444
A seed may float on the breeze
in any direction.

413
00:21:47,497 --> 00:21:48,651
Yeah, I knew you would say that.

414
00:21:48,686 --> 00:21:52,337
- But it's an energy converter.
- An energy converter of what?

415
00:21:52,533 --> 00:21:53,619
I don't know.

416
00:21:54,099 --> 00:21:56,435
Isn't that brilliant? I love not knowing. Keeps me on my toes.

417
00:21:56,446 --> 00:21:58,254
It must be awful being a prophet,

418
00:21:58,464 --> 00:22:00,634
waking up every morning,
"Is it raining? Yes, I said so."

419
00:22:00,669 --> 00:22:03,242
Takes all the fun out of life.
But who designed this, Lucius, hm?

420
00:22:04,913 --> 00:22:07,768
- Who gave you these instructions?
- I think you've babbled enough.

421
00:22:07,803 --> 00:22:09,930
Lucius, tell me, honestly,
I'm on your side.

422
00:22:09,965 --> 00:22:11,966
- I can help.
- You insult the gods.

423
00:22:12,569 --> 00:22:14,910
There can be only one sentence.
At arms!

424
00:22:16,171 --> 00:22:17,560
Oh, morituri te salutant.

425
00:22:17,595 --> 00:22:18,908
Celtic prayers won't help you now.

426
00:22:18,943 --> 00:22:20,222
But, sir, he made me do it.

427
00:22:20,667 --> 00:22:22,693
- Mr Dextrus, please, don't.
- Come on now, Quintus.

428
00:22:22,728 --> 00:22:23,860
Dignity in death.

429
00:22:24,277 --> 00:22:25,807
I respect your victory, Lucius.

430
00:22:26,615 --> 00:22:27,535
Shake on it?

431
00:22:28,898 --> 00:22:29,983
Come on.

432
00:22:31,457 --> 00:22:32,501
Dying man's wish?

433
00:22:37,481 --> 00:22:39,257
- But he's...
- Show me.

434
00:22:42,524 --> 00:22:43,973
The work of the gods.

435
00:22:44,986 --> 00:22:46,066
He's stone!

436
00:22:46,101 --> 00:22:48,395
Armless enough, though.
Whoops! Quintus!

437
00:22:51,479 --> 00:22:53,295
- Run!
- The carvings!

438
00:22:53,469 --> 00:22:54,822
Run!

439
00:22:55,377 --> 00:22:56,785
My carvings!

440
00:22:58,185 --> 00:22:59,400
The work is unbroken.

441
00:23:00,025 --> 00:23:02,309
Oh, Lord of the Mountain,
I beseech you!

442
00:23:02,661 --> 00:23:03,729
This man...

443
00:23:04,439 --> 00:23:06,431
would prevent the rise of Pompeii.

444
00:23:08,995 --> 00:23:11,174
Lord, I beg of you, show yourself.

445
00:23:13,815 --> 00:23:15,306
Show yourself!

446
00:23:23,221 --> 00:23:24,288
No sign of them.

447
00:23:24,982 --> 00:23:26,754
Nice little bit of allons-y.
I think we're all right.

448
00:23:26,789 --> 00:23:27,743
But his arm, Doctor.

449
00:23:28,518 --> 00:23:29,825
Is that happening to Evelina?

450
00:23:31,261 --> 00:23:32,310
What was that?

451
00:23:35,133 --> 00:23:36,048
The mountain?

452
00:23:36,877 --> 00:23:37,988
No, it's closer.

453
00:23:46,169 --> 00:23:48,730
- Footsteps...
- It can't be.

454
00:23:51,301 --> 00:23:53,642
- Footsteps underground.
- What is it?

455
00:23:54,041 --> 00:23:55,120
What IS it?

456
00:24:02,163 --> 00:24:03,961
What is it?
What's that noise?

457
00:24:05,222 --> 00:24:06,913
Doesn't sound like Vesuvius!

458
00:24:06,948 --> 00:24:08,569
Caecilius, all of you! Get out!

459
00:24:08,604 --> 00:24:10,284
- Doctor! What is it?
- I think we're being followed.

460
00:24:14,235 --> 00:24:15,429
Just get out!

461
00:24:30,418 --> 00:24:31,496
The gods are with us.

462
00:24:31,607 --> 00:24:32,692
Water! We need water!

463
00:24:32,727 --> 00:24:34,744
Quintus, all of you, get water!
Donna!

464
00:24:34,956 --> 00:24:37,057
Blest are we to see the gods.

465
00:24:43,441 --> 00:24:44,829
Talk to me, that's all I want!

466
00:24:45,546 --> 00:24:47,378
Talk to me, just tell me you are.

467
00:24:47,764 --> 00:24:49,133
Don't hurt these people!

468
00:24:52,874 --> 00:24:54,807
I'm the Doctor,
just tell me who you are.

469
00:24:57,616 --> 00:24:58,657
Doctor!

470
00:25:17,302 --> 00:25:18,356
What was it?

471
00:25:18,552 --> 00:25:22,385
Carapace of stone,
held together by internal magma,

472
00:25:23,515 --> 00:25:26,479
not too difficult to stop.
But I reckon that's just the foot soldier.

473
00:25:26,698 --> 00:25:28,948
Doctor, or whatever your name is,

474
00:25:29,321 --> 00:25:31,033
you bring bad luck on this house.

475
00:25:31,068 --> 00:25:33,101
I thought your son was brilliant,
aren't you going to thank him?

476
00:25:37,231 --> 00:25:38,318
Still...

477
00:25:38,962 --> 00:25:40,706
If there ARE aliens at work in Pompeii,

478
00:25:40,741 --> 00:25:41,987
it's a good thing we stayed.

479
00:25:42,546 --> 00:25:43,582
Donna!

480
00:25:45,262 --> 00:25:46,251
Donna?

481
00:25:48,223 --> 00:25:49,269
Donna?

482
00:25:49,331 --> 00:25:52,376
You have got to be kidding me.

483
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:55,676
The False Prophet
will surrender both her blood

484
00:25:56,801 --> 00:25:58,778
- and her breath.
- I'll surrender you in a minute.

485
00:25:58,813 --> 00:25:59,764
Don't you dare!

486
00:25:59,799 --> 00:26:01,710
- You will be silent.
- Listen, sister.

487
00:26:02,032 --> 00:26:03,819
You might have eyes
on the back of your hands,

488
00:26:03,843 --> 00:26:06,699
but they'll be in the back of your head
when I've finished with you!

489
00:26:06,838 --> 00:26:08,837
LET me GO!

490
00:26:08,967 --> 00:26:12,293
This prattling voice will cease forever!

491
00:26:12,313 --> 00:26:13,675
Oh, that'll be the day.

492
00:26:16,843 --> 00:26:19,629
No man is allowed
to enter the Temple of Sibyl.

493
00:26:19,664 --> 00:26:21,650
Well, that's all right, just us girls.

494
00:26:21,685 --> 00:26:24,470
Do you know, I met the Sibyl once,
hell of a woman.

495
00:26:24,552 --> 00:26:27,972
Blimey, she could dance the Tarantella!
Nice teeth.

496
00:26:28,315 --> 00:26:30,602
Truth be told, I think
she had a bit of a thing for me.

497
00:26:30,637 --> 00:26:32,153
I said it would never last,
she said, "I know".

498
00:26:32,188 --> 00:26:33,267
Well, she would.

499
00:26:33,302 --> 00:26:35,094
- You OK there?
- Oh, never better.

500
00:26:35,276 --> 00:26:36,779
- I like the toga.
- Thank you.

501
00:26:37,086 --> 00:26:39,268
- And the ropes?
- Yeah, not so much.

502
00:26:41,614 --> 00:26:42,654
What magic is this?

503
00:26:43,053 --> 00:26:46,125
Let me tell you about the Sibyl,
the founder of this religion.

504
00:26:46,353 --> 00:26:48,265
She would be ashamed of you.

505
00:26:48,302 --> 00:26:50,876
All her wisdom and insight gone sour.

506
00:26:51,047 --> 00:26:53,233
Is that how you spread the word?
On the blade of a knife?

507
00:26:53,268 --> 00:26:55,906
Yes, a knife that now welcomes you.

508
00:26:55,941 --> 00:26:58,278
Show me this man!

509
00:27:01,583 --> 00:27:03,915
High Priestess,
the stranger would defile us.

510
00:27:03,950 --> 00:27:06,172
Let me see.
This one is different.

511
00:27:06,207 --> 00:27:08,810
He carries starlight in his wake.

512
00:27:08,825 --> 00:27:10,070
Oh, very perceptive.

513
00:27:10,218 --> 00:27:12,266
Where do these words of wisdom come from?

514
00:27:12,301 --> 00:27:15,629
- The gods whisper to me.
- They've done far more than that.

515
00:27:16,742 --> 00:27:19,778
Might I beg audience?
Look upon the High Priestess?

516
00:27:22,229 --> 00:27:23,318
Oh, my God.

517
00:27:23,992 --> 00:27:26,821
- What's happened to YOU?
- The heavens have blessed me.

518
00:27:27,646 --> 00:27:28,677
If I might...

519
00:27:35,274 --> 00:27:36,945
- Does it hurt?
- It is necessary.

520
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:38,616
- Who told you that?
- The voices.

521
00:27:38,777 --> 00:27:40,317
Is that what's gonna happen to Evelina?

522
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:42,628
Is this what's gonna happen to all of you?

523
00:27:43,722 --> 00:27:45,091
The blessings are manifold.

524
00:27:48,575 --> 00:27:50,888
- They're stone.
- Exactly.

525
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:55,884
The people of Pompeii are turning to stone BEFORE the volcano erupts.

526
00:27:56,186 --> 00:27:59,806
- But why?
- This word, this image in your mind.

527
00:27:59,816 --> 00:28:02,526
This... volcano...
What is that?

528
00:28:02,561 --> 00:28:04,445
More to the point,
why don't you know about it?

529
00:28:05,357 --> 00:28:08,702
- Who are you?
- High Priestess ofthe Sibylline.

530
00:28:08,851 --> 00:28:11,292
No, no, no, no, no,
I'm talking to the creature inside you.

531
00:28:11,541 --> 00:28:13,396
The thing seeding itself
into a human body,

532
00:28:13,431 --> 00:28:14,787
in the dust, in the lungs,

533
00:28:15,233 --> 00:28:17,363
taking over the flesh and turning it into...

534
00:28:17,793 --> 00:28:19,633
- What?
- Your knowledge...

535
00:28:19,951 --> 00:28:21,053
is impossible.

536
00:28:21,434 --> 00:28:23,866
Oh, but you can read my mind,
you know it's not.

537
00:28:23,901 --> 00:28:26,046
I demand you tell me who you are!

538
00:28:26,178 --> 00:28:29,684
We... are... awakening.

539
00:28:29,719 --> 00:28:30,935
The voice of the gods!

540
00:28:31,810 --> 00:28:36,810
Words of wisdom, words of power.
Words of wisdom, words of power...

541
00:28:37,914 --> 00:28:39,327
Name yourself! Planet of origin.

542
00:28:39,362 --> 00:28:40,741
Galactic coordinates.

543
00:28:40,790 --> 00:28:44,371
Designation according to the ratification of the Shadow Proclamation.

544
00:28:44,463 --> 00:28:46,866
We...

545
00:28:47,474 --> 00:28:48,647
... are... rising.

546
00:28:48,682 --> 00:28:51,387
Tell... me... your name!

547
00:28:53,615 --> 00:28:56,841
Pyrovile.

548
00:28:58,787 --> 00:29:02,356
Pyrovile, Pyrovile, Pyrovile...

549
00:29:02,390 --> 00:29:04,708
- What's a Pyrovile?
- That, growing inside HER.

550
00:29:04,743 --> 00:29:07,188
- She's the halfway stage.
- And that turns into...

551
00:29:07,223 --> 00:29:08,973
That thing in the villa was an adult Pyrovile.

552
00:29:09,025 --> 00:29:13,882
And the breath of a Pyrovile will incinerate YOU, Doctor.

553
00:29:13,917 --> 00:29:15,696
I warn you, I'm armed!

554
00:29:15,761 --> 00:29:16,817
Donna, get that grille open.

555
00:29:17,492 --> 00:29:18,948
- What for?
- Just...

556
00:29:20,493 --> 00:29:21,900
What are the Pyrovile doing here?

557
00:29:21,935 --> 00:29:23,308
We fell from the heavens.

558
00:29:23,495 --> 00:29:26,591
We fell so far and so fast,
we were rendered into dust.

559
00:29:26,734 --> 00:29:28,801
Right, creatures of stone,
shattered on impact.

560
00:29:28,836 --> 00:29:30,325
When was that, 17 years ago?

561
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:32,865
We have slept beneath
for thousands of years.

562
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:35,370
OK, so 17 years ago woke you up,

563
00:29:35,552 --> 00:29:37,680
and now you're using human bodies
to reconstitute yourselves,

564
00:29:37,715 --> 00:29:42,015
- but why the psychic powers?
- We opened their minds and found such gifts.

565
00:29:42,050 --> 00:29:43,955
OK, so you force yourself inside a human brain,

566
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:45,295
use the latent psychic talent to bond,

567
00:29:45,330 --> 00:29:46,410
I get that.

568
00:29:46,445 --> 00:29:48,375
But seeing the future, that is way beyond psychic,

569
00:29:48,410 --> 00:29:49,774
you can see through time.

570
00:29:50,182 --> 00:29:52,045
Where does the gift of prophecy come from?

571
00:29:53,043 --> 00:29:54,049
Got it!

572
00:29:54,178 --> 00:29:56,095
- Now get down!
- What, down there?

573
00:29:56,130 --> 00:29:57,134
Yes, down there.

574
00:29:57,233 --> 00:29:59,418
Why can't they predict a volcano?
Why is it being hidden?

575
00:29:59,453 --> 00:30:01,409
Sisters, I see into his mind.

576
00:30:01,636 --> 00:30:02,869
The weapon is harmless!

577
00:30:03,981 --> 00:30:05,163
Yeah, but it's gotta sting.

578
00:30:06,601 --> 00:30:07,800
Get down there!

579
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:14,464
You fought her off with a water pistol.

580
00:30:14,955 --> 00:30:16,762
I bloody love you!

581
00:30:17,397 --> 00:30:18,477
This way!

582
00:30:18,835 --> 00:30:20,941
- Where are we going now?
- Into the volcano.

583
00:30:21,115 --> 00:30:22,846
- No way.
- Yes way.

584
00:30:23,174 --> 00:30:24,227
Appian way.

585
00:30:25,884 --> 00:30:30,110
The stranger would threaten our great endeavour.

586
00:30:30,584 --> 00:30:32,533
The time has come.

587
00:30:33,497 --> 00:30:37,126
The prophecy must ADVANCE!

588
00:30:37,944 --> 00:30:40,690
The prophecy must advance.

589
00:30:41,956 --> 00:30:43,377
Thy will be done.

590
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:47,699
- Summon the Cult of Vulcan.
- Yes, sir.

591
00:30:48,017 --> 00:30:49,529
We must go to the mountain.

592
00:30:51,367 --> 00:30:53,609
Vesuvius awaits.

593
00:30:59,936 --> 00:31:01,392
Sunrise, my love.

594
00:31:02,697 --> 00:31:03,926
A new day.

595
00:31:04,949 --> 00:31:06,955
Even the longest night must end.

596
00:31:07,189 --> 00:31:08,846
The mountain's worse than ever.

597
00:31:09,469 --> 00:31:12,384
We killed a messenger of the gods
in our own house.

598
00:31:13,094 --> 00:31:14,590
Sweetheart, can you see?

599
00:31:15,085 --> 00:31:16,179
Tell us.

600
00:31:16,832 --> 00:31:17,926
What's going to happen?

601
00:31:18,936 --> 00:31:19,927
Just leave her alone.

602
00:31:25,204 --> 00:31:26,846
- I can see...
- What is it?

603
00:31:26,974 --> 00:31:28,108
A choice.

604
00:31:29,349 --> 00:31:30,959
Someone must make a choice.

605
00:31:36,092 --> 00:31:37,950
The most terrible choice.

606
00:31:38,427 --> 00:31:40,575
But if it's aliens setting off the volcano,

607
00:31:41,398 --> 00:31:44,023
doesn't that make it all right,
for you to stop it?

608
00:31:44,058 --> 00:31:45,135
Still part of history.

609
00:31:46,232 --> 00:31:47,948
But I'm history to you.

610
00:31:48,372 --> 00:31:51,598
You saved me, in 2008, you saved us all. Why's that different?

611
00:31:51,745 --> 00:31:53,455
Some things are fixed, some things are in flux.

612
00:31:53,490 --> 00:31:57,105
- Pompeii is fixed.
- How do you know which is which?

613
00:31:57,722 --> 00:31:59,524
Because that's how I see the universe.

614
00:31:59,735 --> 00:32:02,604
Every waking second,
I can see what is, what was,

615
00:32:02,888 --> 00:32:04,903
what could be, what must not.

616
00:32:07,511 --> 00:32:09,133
That's the burden of the Time Lord, Donna.

617
00:32:12,568 --> 00:32:14,127
And I'm the only one left.

618
00:32:16,101 --> 00:32:18,049
- How many people died?
- Stop it.

619
00:32:18,947 --> 00:32:21,624
Doctor, how many people died?

620
00:32:21,659 --> 00:32:22,798
20,000.

621
00:32:23,945 --> 00:32:25,415
Is that what you can see, Doctor?

622
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:27,627
All 20,000?

623
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:30,524
And you think that's all right, do you?

624
00:32:33,872 --> 00:32:35,135
They know we're here.
Come on!

625
00:32:46,823 --> 00:32:48,730
Almighty Vesuvius,

626
00:32:48,894 --> 00:32:52,725
accept these offerings, in Vulcan's design,

627
00:32:52,854 --> 00:32:57,395
and show unto us, I beseech you, the gods of the Underworld.

628
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:31,053
It's the heart of Vesuvius.

629
00:33:35,967 --> 00:33:37,626
We're right inside the mountain.

630
00:33:38,441 --> 00:33:39,537
There's tons of them.

631
00:33:40,012 --> 00:33:40,955
What's that thing?

632
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:45,445
Oh, hurry up and think of something,
Rocky fall's on its way.

633
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:46,820
That's how they arrived.

634
00:33:47,413 --> 00:33:49,101
Or what's left of it. Escape pod?

635
00:33:49,606 --> 00:33:50,700
Prison ship?

636
00:33:51,488 --> 00:33:52,463
Gene bank?

637
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:54,750
But why do they need a volcano?

638
00:33:55,787 --> 00:33:56,831
Maybe...

639
00:33:57,275 --> 00:33:59,745
it erupts, and they launch themselves back into space or something.

640
00:34:00,363 --> 00:34:01,909
Oh, it's worse than that.

641
00:34:02,568 --> 00:34:03,670
How could it be worse?

642
00:34:05,624 --> 00:34:06,834
Doctor, it's getting closer.

643
00:34:07,744 --> 00:34:08,883
Heathens!

644
00:34:10,227 --> 00:34:11,750
Defile us!

645
00:34:11,945 --> 00:34:15,438
They would desecrate your temple, My Lord gods!

646
00:34:15,797 --> 00:34:16,838
Come on.

647
00:34:17,367 --> 00:34:18,993
- We can't go in!
- Well, we can't go back.

648
00:34:20,682 --> 00:34:21,658
Crush them!

649
00:34:21,981 --> 00:34:23,128
Burn them!

650
00:34:43,813 --> 00:34:47,840
There is nowhere to run, Doctor, and daughter of London.

651
00:34:48,535 --> 00:34:51,877
Now then, Lucius, My Lords Pyrovillian,

652
00:34:52,311 --> 00:34:53,890
don't get yourselves in a lava.

653
00:34:54,363 --> 00:34:55,618
- In a lava?
- No?

654
00:34:55,653 --> 00:34:58,226
No. No. But if I might beg the wisdom of the gods,

655
00:34:58,458 --> 00:34:59,690
before we perish,

656
00:35:00,747 --> 00:35:03,428
once this new race of creatures is complete,

657
00:35:03,866 --> 00:35:04,889
then what?

658
00:35:06,065 --> 00:35:09,588
My masters will follow the example of Rome itself.

659
00:35:09,753 --> 00:35:14,753
An almighty empire, bestriding the whole of civilisation.

660
00:35:14,787 --> 00:35:16,428
But if you've crashed,

661
00:35:16,994 --> 00:35:18,885
and you've got all this technology,

662
00:35:19,306 --> 00:35:21,404
why don't you just go home?

663
00:35:21,439 --> 00:35:24,086
The Heaven of Pyrovillia is gone.

664
00:35:24,121 --> 00:35:25,475
What do you mean, "gone"?
Where's it gone?

665
00:35:25,551 --> 00:35:28,537
It was taken.
Pyrovillia is lost.

666
00:35:28,824 --> 00:35:33,824
But there is heat enough in this world for a new species to rise.

667
00:35:33,890 --> 00:35:36,266
Yeah, I should warn you, it's 70% water out there.

668
00:35:36,301 --> 00:35:40,749
Water can boil.
And everything will burn, Doctor.

669
00:35:41,122 --> 00:35:43,336
Then the whole planet is at stake.

670
00:35:43,371 --> 00:35:45,657
Thank you.
That's all I needed to know.

671
00:35:45,692 --> 00:35:46,718
Donna!

672
00:35:51,061 --> 00:35:52,826
You have them, My Lords!

673
00:35:55,829 --> 00:35:57,371
Could we be any more trapped?

674
00:36:04,627 --> 00:36:05,790
Little bit hot.

675
00:36:05,846 --> 00:36:08,502
See? The energy converter takes the lava,

676
00:36:08,824 --> 00:36:10,351
uses the power to create a fusion matrix,

677
00:36:10,386 --> 00:36:11,882
which welds Pyrovile to human.

678
00:36:11,912 --> 00:36:13,694
It's complete, they can convert millions.

679
00:36:13,996 --> 00:36:16,006
Can't you change it?
With these controls?

680
00:36:16,337 --> 00:36:17,544
Course I can, but don't you see?

681
00:36:17,591 --> 00:36:20,687
That's why the soothsayers can't see the volcano.
There IS no volcano.

682
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:22,462
Vesuvius is never going to erupt.

683
00:36:22,990 --> 00:36:24,545
The Pyrovile are stealing all its power,

684
00:36:24,936 --> 00:36:26,678
they'll use it to take over the world.

685
00:36:28,185 --> 00:36:29,284
But... you can change it back?

686
00:36:29,958 --> 00:36:33,157
I can invert the system, set off the volcano, and blow them up, yes.

687
00:36:34,354 --> 00:36:35,554
But that's the choice, Donna.

688
00:36:36,219 --> 00:36:37,656
It's Pompeii or the world.

689
00:36:39,238 --> 00:36:40,403
Oh, my God.

690
00:36:40,551 --> 00:36:42,743
If Pompeii is destroyed then it's notjust history.

691
00:36:43,330 --> 00:36:44,269
It's me.

692
00:36:45,881 --> 00:36:46,943
I make it happen.

693
00:36:54,581 --> 00:36:57,019
But the Pyrovile are rocks, maybe they can't be blown up.

694
00:36:57,054 --> 00:36:59,598
Vesuvius explodes with the force of 24 nuclear bombs.

695
00:37:00,176 --> 00:37:01,337
Nothing can survive it.

696
00:37:02,724 --> 00:37:04,017
Certainly not us.

697
00:37:06,983 --> 00:37:08,772
Never mind us.

698
00:37:14,394 --> 00:37:15,935
Push this lever and it's over.

699
00:37:19,438 --> 00:37:21,324
20,000 people.

700
00:37:41,348 --> 00:37:43,334
Nooooooo!

701
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:54,203
A new prophecy.

702
00:37:54,206 --> 00:37:56,041
The future is changing.

703
00:38:31,701 --> 00:38:33,613
The sky is FALLING!

704
00:38:33,774 --> 00:38:36,737
Death. Only death!

705
00:38:46,101 --> 00:38:47,423
It WAS an escape pod.

706
00:39:07,189 --> 00:39:09,121
Out! Out, everybody out!

707
00:39:10,276 --> 00:39:11,579
Quickly!

708
00:39:31,685 --> 00:39:33,420
You lied to us!

709
00:39:35,263 --> 00:39:36,884
And yet, this was meant to be.

710
00:39:51,724 --> 00:39:52,667
Don't!

711
00:39:52,849 --> 00:39:54,407
Don't go to the beach!

712
00:39:54,805 --> 00:39:56,950
Don't go to the beach, go to the hills!

713
00:39:56,985 --> 00:39:57,990
Listen to me!

714
00:39:58,204 --> 00:40:00,141
Don't go to the beach, it's not SAFE!

715
00:40:00,724 --> 00:40:01,774
Listen to me...!

716
00:40:03,158 --> 00:40:04,094
Come here.

717
00:40:04,438 --> 00:40:05,523
Give him to me!

718
00:40:09,283 --> 00:40:10,369
Come on.

719
00:40:21,465 --> 00:40:23,532
Yeah! God save us, Doctor!

720
00:40:31,231 --> 00:40:32,260
No!

721
00:40:34,629 --> 00:40:36,085
Don't say you can't!

722
00:40:42,177 --> 00:40:43,395
DOCTOR!

723
00:41:07,195 --> 00:41:09,056
You can't just LEAVE them!

724
00:41:09,626 --> 00:41:11,063
Don't you think I've done enough?

725
00:41:11,844 --> 00:41:14,125
History's back in place.
Everyone dies.

726
00:41:15,388 --> 00:41:16,890
You've got to go back.

727
00:41:17,036 --> 00:41:19,806
Doctor, I'm telling you, take this thing BACK!

728
00:41:29,442 --> 00:41:30,891
It's not fair.

729
00:41:31,781 --> 00:41:33,024
No, it's not.

730
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:39,046
But your own planet.
It burned.

731
00:41:40,085 --> 00:41:42,004
That's just it. Don't you see, Donna?

732
00:41:42,225 --> 00:41:44,618
Can't you understand? If I could go back and save them then I would,

733
00:41:44,653 --> 00:41:45,727
but I can't.

734
00:41:50,259 --> 00:41:51,996
I can never go back, I can't.

735
00:41:52,031 --> 00:41:53,747
I just can't, I can't.

736
00:41:54,236 --> 00:41:55,418
Just someone.

737
00:41:56,284 --> 00:41:57,388
Please.

738
00:42:00,235 --> 00:42:01,551
Not the whole town.

739
00:42:02,215 --> 00:42:03,863
Just save someone.

740
00:42:44,555 --> 00:42:45,625
Come with me.

741
00:43:09,922 --> 00:43:11,896
It's never forgotten, Caecilius.

742
00:43:13,468 --> 00:43:16,973
Oh, time will pass, men will move on, and stories will fade.

743
00:43:17,008 --> 00:43:18,022
But one day,

744
00:43:19,751 --> 00:43:21,917
Pompeii will be found, again.

745
00:43:23,304 --> 00:43:24,744
In thousands of years.

746
00:43:28,677 --> 00:43:30,322
And everyone will remember you.

747
00:43:38,517 --> 00:43:39,693
What about you, Evelina?

748
00:43:40,970 --> 00:43:42,176
Can you see anything?

749
00:43:45,952 --> 00:43:47,162
The visions have gone.

750
00:43:48,047 --> 00:43:51,632
The explosion was so powerful
it cracked open a rift in time.

751
00:43:51,917 --> 00:43:54,395
Just for a second. That's what
gave you the gift of prophecy.

752
00:43:55,747 --> 00:43:58,604
It echoed back into the Pyrovillian alternative.

753
00:44:00,382 --> 00:44:01,724
But not any more.

754
00:44:02,844 --> 00:44:04,145
You're free.

755
00:44:07,421 --> 00:44:08,410
But tell me,

756
00:44:10,289 --> 00:44:11,627
who are you, Doctor?

757
00:44:12,415 --> 00:44:16,646
With your words, and your temple containing such size within?

758
00:44:17,075 --> 00:44:18,340
Oh, I was never here.

759
00:44:19,506 --> 00:44:20,473
Don't tell anyone.

760
00:44:22,823 --> 00:44:26,152
The great god Vulcan must be enraged!

761
00:44:29,066 --> 00:44:30,413
It's so volcanic.

762
00:44:35,173 --> 00:44:36,247
It's like some sort of...

763
00:44:38,305 --> 00:44:39,396
volcano.

764
00:44:44,085 --> 00:44:45,228
All those people.

765
00:45:35,515 --> 00:45:36,614
Thank you.

766
00:45:37,691 --> 00:45:38,883
Yeah.

767
00:45:43,838 --> 00:45:44,765
You were right.

768
00:45:46,002 --> 00:45:47,657
Sometimes I need someone.

769
00:45:50,602 --> 00:45:51,694
Welcome aboard.

770
00:45:53,129 --> 00:45:54,152
Yeah.

771
00:46:07,538 --> 00:46:09,032
Metella, my love,

772
00:46:09,067 --> 00:46:10,694
have you seen that clasp?

773
00:46:10,827 --> 00:46:11,835
The beetle one.

774
00:46:12,422 --> 00:46:15,986
- The Egyptians do love a scarab.
- Here we are, I was giving it a polish.

775
00:46:16,296 --> 00:46:17,625
Now calm down.

776
00:46:17,694 --> 00:46:20,963
If I get that contract, for the marble granaries of Alexandria,

777
00:46:21,147 --> 00:46:22,850
we'll be rich, you'll see...

778
00:46:23,065 --> 00:46:24,663
Hold on there, Evelina.

779
00:46:25,105 --> 00:46:27,044
You are not going out wearing that!

780
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:30,620
Don't start, Dad,
it's what all the girls in Rome are wearing.

781
00:46:31,367 --> 00:46:32,323
I'll see you later.

782
00:46:34,007 --> 00:46:35,366
Are you seeing that boy again?

783
00:46:35,610 --> 00:46:37,070
Oh, look at Quintus.

784
00:46:37,117 --> 00:46:38,757
My son, the doctor.

785
00:46:38,792 --> 00:46:41,232
Mum, I've told you,
I'm not a doctor, not yet.

786
00:46:41,555 --> 00:46:43,614
I'm just a student ofthe physical sciences.

787
00:46:43,615 --> 00:46:45,140
Well, that's a doctor to me.

788
00:46:46,569 --> 00:46:48,873
Give thanks to the household gods before you go.

789
00:46:48,908 --> 00:46:49,975
There's a good boy.

790
00:46:51,357 --> 00:46:54,905
Come here, let me fix it.
You've got that folded all wrong...

791
00:46:57,894 --> 00:46:59,355
Thank you, household gods.

792
00:47:00,712 --> 00:47:02,000
Thank you for everything.

793
00:47:13,242 --> 00:47:15,680
Now then, Doctor Noble, Mrs Noble, come with me.

794
00:47:15,715 --> 00:47:17,278
Oh, no, no, we're not married.

795
00:47:17,313 --> 00:47:18,842
- So not married.
- Never.

796
00:47:18,927 --> 00:47:23,551
Here at Ood Operations, we like to think ofthe Ood as our trusted friends...

797
00:47:23,586 --> 00:47:24,885
Your unwanted guests.

798
00:47:24,958 --> 00:47:27,698
- Because at heart, what is an Ood...
- I'm on YOUR side!

799
00:47:27,733 --> 00:47:29,393
... but a reflection of us?

800
00:47:29,409 --> 00:47:30,430
It's a revolution.

801
00:47:30,447 --> 00:47:33,288
- If your Ood is happy...
- The circle must be broken.

802
00:47:33,296 --> 00:47:34,655
What is it? What is the circle?

803
00:47:34,656 --> 00:47:36,354
Then you'll be happy, too.

804
00:47:37,070 --> 00:47:38,108
Shoot!

805
00:47:38,703 --> 00:47:41,108
Doctor, Donna, friends!
Doctor, Donna, friends!
