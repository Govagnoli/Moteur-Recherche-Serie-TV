<i>Mistletoe!</i>

2
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:21,058
<i>Mistletoe!</i>

3
00:00:29,409 --> 00:00:31,000
- Fresh here today.
- Good afternoon.

4
00:00:51,541 --> 00:00:53,869
Hot chestnuts. Chestnuts.

5
00:00:54,115 --> 00:00:57,760
# Oh, tidings of comfort and joy

6
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:59,560
# Comfort and joy... #

7
00:00:59,902 --> 00:01:02,691
- You there, boy. What day is this?
- Christmas Eve, sir.

8
00:01:02,791 --> 00:01:04,829
- What year?
- You thick or something?

9
00:01:05,125 --> 00:01:06,784
Oi. Just answer the question.

10
00:01:06,884 --> 00:01:09,060
Year of our Lord 1851, sir.

11
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:11,611
Right. Nice year. Bit dull.

12
00:01:12,002 --> 00:01:13,123
<i>Doctor!</i>

13
00:01:15,318 --> 00:01:16,662
<i>Doctor?</i>

14
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:18,990
Who, me?

15
00:01:20,624 --> 00:01:21,760
<i>Doctor!</i>

16
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:25,141
Don't worry, don't worry. Stand back,
what have we got here?

17
00:01:26,864 --> 00:01:29,514
I Got it. Whatever's behind that door
I think you should get out of here.

18
00:01:29,614 --> 00:01:30,606
Doctor!

19
00:01:30,706 --> 00:01:32,334
No, I'm standing right here. Hello.

20
00:01:32,434 --> 00:01:35,030
- Don't be so stupid, who are you?
- I'm The Doctor.

21
00:01:35,194 --> 00:01:36,953
- Doctor who?
- Just The Doctor.

22
00:01:37,129 --> 00:01:40,013
Well, there can't be two of ya.
Where the hell have you been?

23
00:01:40,113 --> 00:01:42,992
Right there. Don't worry. Stand back.
What have we got here, then?

24
00:01:43,144 --> 00:01:47,040
- Hold on, hold on. Who are you?
- I'm The Doctor. Simply The Doctor.

25
00:01:47,377 --> 00:01:49,676
The one, the only and the best.

26
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:51,732
Rosita, give me the sonic screwdriver.

27
00:01:51,832 --> 00:01:53,776
- What?
- Now quickly, get back to the TARDIS.

28
00:01:53,876 --> 00:01:55,640
- Back to the what?
- Stand back, sir.

29
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:57,868
This is a job for a Time Lord.

30
00:01:58,278 --> 00:01:59,340
Job for a what lord?

31
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:03,029
- Oh, that's different.
- Oh, that's new.

32
00:02:03,975 --> 00:02:05,533
"Allons-y."

37
00:02:44,601 --> 00:02:47,938
I've been hunting this beast for a
good fortnight. Now step back, sir.

38
00:02:51,236 --> 00:02:53,022
Some sort of primitive conversion,

39
00:02:53,685 --> 00:02:55,361
like they took the brain
of a cat or a dog.

40
00:02:55,461 --> 00:02:57,600
Well, talking's all very well.
Rosita.

41
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:00,632
- I'm ready.
- Now, watch and learn.

42
00:03:06,691 --> 00:03:12,110
Excellent. Now then, let's pull
this timorous beastie down to earth.

43
00:03:15,462 --> 00:03:16,339
Or not.

44
00:03:16,439 --> 00:03:18,124
I might be in a little bit of trouble.

45
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:20,093
Nothing changes. I've got you.

46
00:03:24,589 --> 00:03:25,620
You idiots!

47
00:03:28,627 --> 00:03:29,777
Perhaps if you could pull?

48
00:03:29,877 --> 00:03:32,799
I am pulling. In this position,
I couldn't not pull, could I?

49
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,840
Then I'd suggest you let go, sir.

50
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:42,049
I'm not letting you out of my sight,
Doctor. Don't you recognise me?

51
00:03:42,149 --> 00:03:44,120
No, should I? Have we met?

52
00:03:44,446 --> 00:03:47,463
This is hardly the right time for me
to go through my social calendar.

53
00:03:53,286 --> 00:03:54,075
Whoa!

54
00:04:07,681 --> 00:04:10,400
- It's gonna jump!
- We're gonna fa-a-a-all!

55
00:04:39,974 --> 00:04:41,791
Well, I'm glad you think it's so funny.

56
00:04:42,983 --> 00:04:46,037
You're mad. Both of you.
You could've got killed.

57
00:04:46,277 --> 00:04:48,054
But, evidently, we did not.

58
00:04:48,225 --> 00:04:50,556
Oh, I should introduce Rosita.

59
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:53,191
My faithful companion,
always telling me off.

60
00:04:53,291 --> 00:04:54,600
Well, they do, don't they?

61
00:04:55,052 --> 00:04:56,045
Rosita?

62
00:04:56,848 --> 00:04:59,000
Good name. Hello, Rosita.

63
00:04:59,415 --> 00:05:01,851
Huh. Now I'll have to go
and dismantle the traps.

64
00:05:02,696 --> 00:05:03,781
All that for nothing.

65
00:05:04,009 --> 00:05:06,491
And we've only got 20 minutes
till the funeral, don't forget.

66
00:05:07,632 --> 00:05:09,280
Then back to the TARDIS, right?

67
00:05:09,645 --> 00:05:11,800
- Funeral?
- Oh, long story.

68
00:05:11,979 --> 00:05:14,020
Not my own, not yet.

69
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:16,904
Oooh, I'm not as young as I was.

70
00:05:17,124 --> 00:05:19,295
Well, not as young as you were
when you were me.

71
00:05:19,395 --> 00:05:20,440
When I was who?

72
00:05:21,635 --> 00:05:23,720
- You really don't recognise me?
- Not at all.

73
00:05:24,895 --> 00:05:26,261
But you're The Doctor.

74
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,255
The next Doctor.

75
00:05:28,924 --> 00:05:31,200
Or the next but one,
a future Doctor anyway.

76
00:05:31,429 --> 00:05:33,760
No, no, don't tell me
how it happened. Although...

77
00:05:34,515 --> 00:05:37,047
I hope I don't just trip over a brick,
that'd be embarrassing.

78
00:05:37,147 --> 00:05:38,534
Then again, painless.

79
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:41,601
- Worse way to go, depends on the brick.
- You're gabbling, sir.

80
00:05:41,973 --> 00:05:44,912
Now, might I ask,
who are you, exactly?

81
00:05:48,137 --> 00:05:49,411
No, I'm, uh...

82
00:05:49,821 --> 00:05:53,169
I'm just Smith. John Smith.
But I've heard all about you, Doctor.

83
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:55,825
Bit of a legend, if I say so myself.

84
00:05:56,820 --> 00:06:00,759
Modesty forbids me to agree
with you, sir. But yes. Yes, I am.

85
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:03,917
A legend with certain memories missing.

86
00:06:04,017 --> 00:06:06,080
- Am I right?
- How do you know that?

87
00:06:06,514 --> 00:06:07,880
You've forgotten me.

88
00:06:09,871 --> 00:06:12,400
Great swathes of my life
have been stolen away.

89
00:06:13,105 --> 00:06:15,017
When I turn my mind to the past,

90
00:06:16,285 --> 00:06:18,513
- there's nothing.
- Going how far back?

91
00:06:18,613 --> 00:06:19,787
Since the Cybermen.

92
00:06:21,058 --> 00:06:24,118
Masters of that hellish wall-scuttler
and old enemies of mine.

93
00:06:24,218 --> 00:06:25,806
Now at work in London town.

94
00:06:26,223 --> 00:06:27,617
You won't believe this, Mr Smith,

95
00:06:28,362 --> 00:06:30,720
but they are creatures
from another world.

96
00:06:31,175 --> 00:06:33,360
Really? Wow.

97
00:06:33,921 --> 00:06:38,123
It's said they fell onto London,
out of the sky in a blaze of light.

98
00:06:40,762 --> 00:06:41,702
And they found me.

99
00:06:48,005 --> 00:06:49,444
Something was taken.

100
00:06:50,901 --> 00:06:52,220
And something was lost.

101
00:06:54,632 --> 00:06:55,623
What was I like?

102
00:06:57,111 --> 00:06:57,940
In the past?

103
00:07:00,007 --> 00:07:02,039
I don't think I should say. Sorry.

104
00:07:02,348 --> 00:07:04,519
Got to be careful with memory loss.
One wrong word...

105
00:07:04,619 --> 00:07:05,819
It's strange, though.

106
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:09,440
I talk of Cybermen from the stars

107
00:07:10,809 --> 00:07:12,728
and you don't blink, Mr Smith.

108
00:07:12,828 --> 00:07:14,212
Ah, don't blink, remember that?

109
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:17,560
Whatever you do, don't blink?
The blinking and the statues?

110
00:07:18,117 --> 00:07:19,732
Sally and the angels? No?

111
00:07:20,363 --> 00:07:22,040
You're a very odd man.

112
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:24,126
Hmm, I still am.

113
00:07:25,785 --> 00:07:27,653
- Something's wrong here.
- Oh, the funeral.

114
00:07:27,861 --> 00:07:29,400
The funeral's at two o'clock.

115
00:07:29,735 --> 00:07:32,300
It's been a pleasure, Mr Smith.
Don't breathe a word of it.

116
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,667
- Can't I come with you?
- It's far dangerous.

117
00:07:34,982 --> 00:07:37,260
Rest assured, I shall keep
this city safe.

118
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,680
Oh, and, er...

119
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:42,420
- merry Christmas, Mr Smith.
- Merry Christmas, Doctor.

120
00:07:55,117 --> 00:07:58,367
Report. Cybershade 16 has made contact.

121
00:07:59,086 --> 00:08:00,846
Then observe the enemy.

122
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:03,160
This man is dangerous.

123
00:08:03,389 --> 00:08:05,560
This man is our enemy.

124
00:08:05,798 --> 00:08:08,045
This man is The Doctor.

125
00:08:08,145 --> 00:08:10,997
I've been hunting this beast for a
good fortnight. Now step back, sir.

126
00:08:11,735 --> 00:08:14,397
The attack is scheduled for 1400 hours.

127
00:08:14,497 --> 00:08:17,409
Plans for the Ascension
demand a successful intervention.

128
00:08:17,509 --> 00:08:19,427
Is everything in position?

129
00:08:19,527 --> 00:08:21,326
That's rather dependent on you.

130
00:08:21,793 --> 00:08:23,666
All I can promise is to do my best.

131
00:08:23,766 --> 00:08:26,040
Define the parameters of "best".

132
00:08:26,770 --> 00:08:31,060
As you would say, I will operate
at maximum efficiency.

133
00:08:31,665 --> 00:08:33,394
And you'll keep
your part of the bargain?

134
00:08:33,494 --> 00:08:37,804
You will be heralded, in the new age
at the Court of the CyberKing.

135
00:08:38,006 --> 00:08:39,960
The CyberKing will rise.

136
00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:44,388
The CyberKing will rise, indeed.

137
00:08:45,272 --> 00:08:46,313
How like a man.

138
00:08:48,079 --> 00:08:49,694
Now, if you'll excuse me,

139
00:08:50,565 --> 00:08:52,420
I have a funeral to attend.

140
00:09:02,384 --> 00:09:06,996
The late Reverend Fairchild, leaving his
place of residence for the last time.

141
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:09,874
God rest his soul.

142
00:09:11,872 --> 00:09:14,055
Now, with the house empty,

143
00:09:14,155 --> 00:09:17,474
I shall effect an entrance at the rear
while you go back to the TARDIS.

144
00:09:18,383 --> 00:09:20,440
This is hardly work for a woman.

145
00:09:21,012 --> 00:09:22,735
Oh, don't mind me saving your life.

146
00:09:22,835 --> 00:09:24,318
That's work for a woman, isn't it?

147
00:09:24,418 --> 00:09:28,199
The Doctor's companion does what
The Doctor says. Off you go.

148
00:09:41,085 --> 00:09:43,054
- Hello.
- How did you get in?

149
00:09:43,218 --> 00:09:45,000
Oh, front door. I'm good at doors.

150
00:09:45,735 --> 00:09:48,626
Do you mind my asking,
is that your sonic screwdriver?

151
00:09:48,897 --> 00:09:51,040
Yeah. I'd be lost without it.

152
00:09:51,667 --> 00:09:52,695
That's a screwdriver.

153
00:09:54,298 --> 00:09:55,440
How's it sonic?

154
00:09:56,125 --> 00:09:57,841
Well, er, it makes a noise.

155
00:09:58,895 --> 00:10:00,208
That's sonic, isn't it?

156
00:10:00,479 --> 00:10:02,340
Now, since we're acting
like common burglars,

157
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,860
I suggest we get out of plain view.

158
00:10:09,057 --> 00:10:11,329
This investigation of yours,
what's it about?

159
00:10:11,429 --> 00:10:12,812
It started with a murder.

160
00:10:12,912 --> 00:10:14,332
Oh, good.

161
00:10:15,941 --> 00:10:17,295
I mean bad, but whose?

162
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:21,211
Mr Jackson Lake, a teacher
of mathematics from Sussex.

163
00:10:21,501 --> 00:10:23,432
He came to London three weeks ago

164
00:10:24,075 --> 00:10:26,600
- and died a terrible death.
- Cybermen?

165
00:10:27,408 --> 00:10:31,280
It's hard to say, his body was
never found. But then it started.

166
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:33,502
More secret murders,
then abductions.

167
00:10:34,379 --> 00:10:37,686
Children, stolen away in silence.

168
00:10:39,251 --> 00:10:41,213
- So whose house is this?
- The latest murder.

169
00:10:41,611 --> 00:10:45,480
The Reverend Aubrey Fairchild.
Found with burns to his forehead,

170
00:10:45,721 --> 00:10:47,594
like some advanced form
of electrocution.

171
00:10:48,143 --> 00:10:50,989
- But who was he, was he important?
- You ask a lot of questions.

172
00:10:51,411 --> 00:10:52,520
I'm your companion.

173
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:56,147
The Reverend,
was the pillar of the community,

174
00:10:56,674 --> 00:10:58,354
a member of many parish boards.

175
00:10:58,454 --> 00:11:00,250
A keen advocate of children's charity.

176
00:11:00,350 --> 00:11:01,348
Children again.

177
00:11:01,524 --> 00:11:03,200
Why would the Cybermen want him dead?

178
00:11:03,897 --> 00:11:06,977
And what's his connection
to the first death, this Jackson Lake?

179
00:11:08,566 --> 00:11:09,595
It's funny,

180
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:12,860
I seem to be telling you everything.

181
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:16,351
As though you
engendered some sort of...

182
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,100
trust.

183
00:11:19,941 --> 00:11:21,640
You seem familiar, Mr Smith.

184
00:11:23,083 --> 00:11:24,240
I know your face.

185
00:11:25,894 --> 00:11:28,607
- But how?
- I wonder.

186
00:11:29,831 --> 00:11:32,664
I can't help noticing
you're wearing a fob watch.

187
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:35,681
Is that important?

188
00:11:36,634 --> 00:11:39,524
Legend has it
that the memories of a Time Lord

189
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:41,920
can be contained within a watch.

190
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:44,240
Do you mind?

191
00:11:47,873 --> 00:11:48,933
It's said

192
00:11:49,652 --> 00:11:50,760
that if it's opened...

193
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:55,320
Oh. Maybe not.

194
00:11:56,006 --> 00:11:59,457
- It's more for decoration.
- Yeah. Anyway, alien infiltration.

195
00:11:59,557 --> 00:12:02,176
Yes, Look for anything different,
possibly metal.

196
00:12:02,276 --> 00:12:03,773
Anything that doesn't seem to belong,

197
00:12:03,873 --> 00:12:06,502
perhaps a mechanical device
that could fit no earthly engine.

198
00:12:06,602 --> 00:12:08,047
It could even seem to be organic,

199
00:12:08,375 --> 00:12:11,177
but unlike any organism
of the natural world. Shh!

200
00:12:12,211 --> 00:12:13,239
What's that noise?

201
00:12:13,719 --> 00:12:15,780
Oh, it's just me...

202
00:12:16,638 --> 00:12:17,496
whistling.

203
00:12:20,745 --> 00:12:22,215
I wonder what's in here, though.

204
00:12:25,015 --> 00:12:25,652
Ah.

205
00:12:27,109 --> 00:12:29,128
Different and metal, you were right.

206
00:12:29,228 --> 00:12:31,267
They are infostamps.

207
00:12:32,510 --> 00:12:34,081
I mean, at a guess.

208
00:12:35,210 --> 00:12:38,985
If I were you, I'd say they worked
something like this.

209
00:12:41,458 --> 00:12:43,704
See? Compressed information.

210
00:12:44,329 --> 00:12:45,269
Tons of it.

211
00:12:46,434 --> 00:12:50,920
That is the history of London,
1066 to the present day.

212
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:53,815
This is like a disk, a Cyberdisk.

213
00:12:53,915 --> 00:12:56,188
But why would the Cybermen
need something so simple?

214
00:12:57,940 --> 00:12:59,320
They've gotta be wireless.

215
00:13:01,126 --> 00:13:02,243
Unless...

216
00:13:03,183 --> 00:13:05,612
they're in the wrong century,
they haven't got much power.

217
00:13:06,155 --> 00:13:08,880
They need plain old basic
infostamps to update themselves.

218
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:11,080
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

219
00:13:12,183 --> 00:13:13,066
No, what is it?

220
00:13:13,874 --> 00:13:16,780
- What's wrong?
- I've seen one of these before.

221
00:13:22,232 --> 00:13:23,570
I was holding...

222
00:13:24,402 --> 00:13:25,600
this device,

223
00:13:26,257 --> 00:13:27,703
the night I lost my mind.

224
00:13:29,382 --> 00:13:30,757
The night I regenerated.

225
00:13:38,446 --> 00:13:41,266
The Cybermen, they made me change.

226
00:13:41,809 --> 00:13:44,040
My mind, my face, my whole self.

227
00:13:45,954 --> 00:13:47,008
And you were there.

228
00:13:48,415 --> 00:13:49,254
Who are you?

229
00:13:49,853 --> 00:13:50,693
A friend.

230
00:13:51,633 --> 00:13:52,478
I swear.

231
00:13:53,469 --> 00:13:54,960
Then I beg you, John.

232
00:13:55,437 --> 00:13:56,385
Help me.

233
00:13:56,889 --> 00:13:57,502
Ah.

234
00:13:58,492 --> 00:13:59,760
Two words I never refuse.

235
00:14:02,536 --> 00:14:04,626
But it's not a conversation
for a dead man's house.

236
00:14:04,726 --> 00:14:08,000
It'll make more sense if we go back
to the TARDIS... Your TARDIS.

237
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:11,429
Hold on, I just need to do
a final check. Won't take a tick.

238
00:14:12,054 --> 00:14:15,587
There's one more thing I cannot figure.
If this room's got infostamps, maybe,

239
00:14:16,155 --> 00:14:18,797
just maybe, it's got something
that needs infostamping.

240
00:14:20,141 --> 00:14:21,062
OK.

241
00:14:21,485 --> 00:14:22,800
I think we should run.

242
00:14:23,801 --> 00:14:26,608
- Run, Doctor! Now, Doctor!
- Delete!

243
00:14:30,164 --> 00:14:31,820
The Doctor will be deleted.

244
00:14:34,019 --> 00:14:36,800
- Delete!
- Stairs! Can't lead them outside!

245
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:45,504
Delete!

246
00:14:46,808 --> 00:14:48,429
I'm a dab hand with a cutlass.

247
00:14:48,529 --> 00:14:50,518
You don't want to come near me
when I've got one of these.

248
00:14:50,618 --> 00:14:52,440
This is your last warning. No?

249
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:54,652
OK, this is really your last warning!

250
00:14:54,752 --> 00:14:55,795
- I give up.
- Delete!

251
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:56,723
Listen to me!

252
00:14:56,823 --> 00:14:59,317
Whatever you're doing stuck in 1851,
I can help!

253
00:14:59,417 --> 00:15:02,497
I'm the only person in the world
who can help you! Listen to me!

254
00:15:02,597 --> 00:15:03,594
Delete!

255
00:15:03,897 --> 00:15:05,153
I'm The Doctor.

256
00:15:05,443 --> 00:15:08,962
You need me. Check your memory
banks, my name's The Doctor.

257
00:15:09,202 --> 00:15:12,160
Leave this man alone,
The Doctor is me!

258
00:15:13,482 --> 00:15:14,359
Delete!

259
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:17,857
The Doctor, remember?
I'm The Doctor!

260
00:15:18,621 --> 00:15:22,220
You need me alive!
You need The Doctor, and that's me!

261
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:29,434
Delete!

262
00:15:45,227 --> 00:15:47,800
Infostamp with
a cyclo-Steinham core.

263
00:15:48,137 --> 00:15:50,400
You ripped open the core
and broke the safety, zap!

264
00:15:51,923 --> 00:15:54,648
- Only The Doctor would think of that.
- I did that...

265
00:15:56,384 --> 00:15:57,312
last time.

266
00:15:58,283 --> 00:15:59,532
Come here, you'll be OK.

267
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:02,459
Let me just check.

268
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:05,564
You told them you were The Doctor.
Why did you do that?

269
00:16:05,664 --> 00:16:07,920
Oh, I was just protecting you.

270
00:16:08,244 --> 00:16:11,355
You're trying to take away
the only thing I've got, like they did.

271
00:16:12,295 --> 00:16:15,476
They stole something,
something so precious.

272
00:16:17,303 --> 00:16:18,360
But I can't remember.

273
00:16:19,249 --> 00:16:20,372
What happened to me?

274
00:16:20,978 --> 00:16:23,011
- What did they do?
- We'll find out.

275
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:25,497
You and me, together.

276
00:16:29,528 --> 00:16:32,594
Forasmuch as it hath pleased
Almighty God of his great mercy,

277
00:16:32,745 --> 00:16:36,120
to take unto Himself the soul
of our dear brother here departed,

278
00:16:36,293 --> 00:16:38,526
we therefore commit
his body to the ground.

279
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,836
Earth to earth, ashes to ashes
and dust to dust,

280
00:16:43,246 --> 00:16:46,647
in sure and certain hope of the
Resurrection to eternal life,

281
00:16:46,937 --> 00:16:48,678
through our Lord Jesus Christ,

282
00:16:50,249 --> 00:16:54,644
who shall change our vile body,
that it may be like

283
00:16:55,357 --> 00:17:00,084
unto his glorious body,
according to the mighty working...

284
00:17:01,901 --> 00:17:02,981
Do continue.

285
00:17:03,827 --> 00:17:06,022
Madam, I must protest.

286
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:07,348
Whatever for?

287
00:17:07,448 --> 00:17:10,489
A lady at the graveside
is debatable enough, but...

288
00:17:11,322 --> 00:17:13,720
- your apparel...
- Is it too exciting?

289
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:16,367
You're disgracing the ceremony,
dressed like a harlot.

290
00:17:16,626 --> 00:17:18,986
Oh, and you should know, Mr Cole.

291
00:17:19,086 --> 00:17:20,097
How do you know my name?

292
00:17:20,197 --> 00:17:25,320
You've walked past me so many times,
all you good men of charity,

293
00:17:25,649 --> 00:17:27,480
never once asking my name.

294
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:29,712
It's Miss Hartigan, isn't it?

295
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:31,428
Oh, you noticed.

296
00:17:31,839 --> 00:17:34,479
I saw you looking, you cheeky boy.

297
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:37,040
I'm sorry, but who is she?

298
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:41,153
Matron of the St Joseph Workhouse,
your humble servant.

299
00:17:41,695 --> 00:17:43,000
Oh, I've watched you all.

300
00:17:43,616 --> 00:17:45,041
Visiting, smiling.

301
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:48,583
Bestowing your beneficence upon the poor

302
00:17:48,753 --> 00:17:50,741
while I scrubbed down their filthy beds.

303
00:17:50,841 --> 00:17:53,234
I must insist that you depart.

304
00:17:53,512 --> 00:17:56,527
But that's why the late
Reverend Fairchild had to die.

305
00:17:58,142 --> 00:18:00,199
To gather you all in one place.

306
00:18:00,299 --> 00:18:01,867
Where better than a funeral?

307
00:18:02,574 --> 00:18:05,716
Man that is born of woman
hath but a short time to live.

308
00:18:05,999 --> 00:18:09,425
Although I've got some friends
who might disagree with that.

309
00:18:09,525 --> 00:18:10,769
Would you like to meet them?

310
00:18:11,533 --> 00:18:14,166
Hark! I can hear them now.

311
00:18:48,875 --> 00:18:53,682
Mr Cole, Mr Scoones, Mr Fetch,
Mr Milligan, stay where you are.

312
00:18:53,782 --> 00:18:58,560
You're needed. The rest of you are
disposable. Sorry.

313
00:18:58,791 --> 00:19:00,570
But what manner of men are they?

314
00:19:01,434 --> 00:19:02,539
Cybermen.

315
00:19:03,718 --> 00:19:05,346
Save yourselves!

316
00:19:22,513 --> 00:19:27,605
I repeat, Mr Cole, Mr Scoones,
Mr Fetch, Mr Milligan. Stay.

317
00:19:53,545 --> 00:19:57,160
- You monstrous witch!
- Merry Christmas to you, too.

318
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:58,900
But why are we spared?

319
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,674
- What do you need us for?
- Your children.

320
00:20:02,563 --> 00:20:04,437
It's funny, now I think of it, but,

321
00:20:04,752 --> 00:20:08,191
in all these years not one
of you has asked my first name.

322
00:20:10,575 --> 00:20:11,820
It's Mercy.

323
00:20:15,611 --> 00:20:16,640
Doctor!

324
00:20:17,687 --> 00:20:18,848
I thought you were dead!

325
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:21,400
Now then, Rosita.
A little decorum.

326
00:20:22,073 --> 00:20:23,524
You've been gone for so long.

327
00:20:23,795 --> 00:20:27,683
He's always doing this,
leaving me behind. Going frantic.

328
00:20:27,783 --> 00:20:30,338
- What about the TARDIS?
- Oh, she's ready. Come on.

329
00:20:31,429 --> 00:20:33,152
I'm looking forward to this.

330
00:20:34,042 --> 00:20:35,537
You were right though, Rosita.

331
00:20:36,351 --> 00:20:39,007
The Reverend Fairchild's death
was the work of the Cybermen.

332
00:20:39,632 --> 00:20:40,969
So, you live here?

333
00:20:41,216 --> 00:20:44,360
A temporary base,
until we rout the enemy.

334
00:20:44,782 --> 00:20:47,205
The TARDIS is magnificent,
but it's hardly a home.

335
00:20:47,305 --> 00:20:50,300
- And where's the TARDIS now?
- In the yard.

336
00:20:52,631 --> 00:20:54,643
Er... What's all this luggage?

337
00:20:54,743 --> 00:20:59,045
Evidence. The property of Jackson Lake,
the first man to be murdered.

338
00:21:00,055 --> 00:21:04,042
Oh, but my new friend is a fighter,
Rosita, much like myself.

339
00:21:04,282 --> 00:21:06,462
He faced the Cybermen with a cutlass.

340
00:21:08,202 --> 00:21:10,780
I'm not ashamed to say,
he was braver than I.

341
00:21:13,009 --> 00:21:14,227
He was quite brilliant.

342
00:21:17,504 --> 00:21:18,709
Are you whistling again?

343
00:21:20,191 --> 00:21:22,589
Yes. Yes, I am, yeah. Yeah.

344
00:21:31,185 --> 00:21:33,040
That's another man's property.

345
00:21:33,324 --> 00:21:35,500
Well, a dead man's.

346
00:21:37,761 --> 00:21:39,086
How did you two meet, then?

347
00:21:39,692 --> 00:21:40,922
He saved my life.

348
00:21:42,972 --> 00:21:45,301
Late one night, by the Osterman's Wharf,

349
00:21:46,121 --> 00:21:46,985
this...

350
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:50,241
creature came out of the shadows.

351
00:21:50,941 --> 00:21:52,424
A man made of metal.

352
00:21:55,001 --> 00:21:56,219
I thought I was gonna die.

353
00:21:57,474 --> 00:21:58,358
And then,

354
00:21:59,209 --> 00:22:00,124
there he was.

355
00:22:01,481 --> 00:22:02,364
The Doctor.

356
00:22:05,381 --> 00:22:06,592
Can you help him, sir?

357
00:22:07,671 --> 00:22:09,406
He has such terrible dreams.

358
00:22:09,949 --> 00:22:10,977
Wakes at night

359
00:22:11,684 --> 00:22:13,160
in such a state of terror.

360
00:22:13,785 --> 00:22:14,794
Come now, Rosita.

361
00:22:16,203 --> 00:22:18,343
With all the things
a Time Lord has seen,

362
00:22:18,443 --> 00:22:22,050
everything he's lost,
he may surely have bad dreams.

363
00:22:23,722 --> 00:22:24,580
Yeah.

364
00:22:29,155 --> 00:22:31,440
Oh, now, look.

365
00:22:33,735 --> 00:22:35,559
Jackson Lake had an infostamp.

366
00:22:35,786 --> 00:22:36,798
But how?

367
00:22:37,479 --> 00:22:38,444
Is that significant?

368
00:22:38,956 --> 00:22:41,631
Doctor, the answer to all this
is in your TARDIS.

369
00:22:42,508 --> 00:22:45,391
- Can I see it?
- Mr Smith, it would be my honour.

370
00:22:50,718 --> 00:22:51,898
There she is!

371
00:22:52,787 --> 00:22:55,387
My transport through time and space.

372
00:22:57,425 --> 00:22:58,560
The TARDIS.

373
00:22:59,318 --> 00:23:01,387
You've got a balloon.

374
00:23:02,706 --> 00:23:05,440
TARDIS. T-A-R-D-I-S.

375
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:09,583
It stands for Tethered Aerial
Release Developed In Style.

376
00:23:09,683 --> 00:23:10,420
D'you see?

377
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:13,755
Well, I do now.

378
00:23:14,537 --> 00:23:17,225
I like it. Good TARDIS.

379
00:23:19,079 --> 00:23:22,266
Brilliant. Nice one.
And is it inflated by gas, yeah?

380
00:23:22,366 --> 00:23:25,560
We're adjacent to the Mutton Street
Gasworks, I pay them a modest fee.

381
00:23:25,829 --> 00:23:28,440
- Good work, Jed.
- Glad to be of service, sir.

382
00:23:31,154 --> 00:23:32,486
You've got quite a bit of money.

383
00:23:32,838 --> 00:23:34,505
Oh, you get nothing for nothing.

384
00:23:35,042 --> 00:23:38,006
- How's that ripped panel, Jed?
- All repaired, should work a treat.

385
00:23:38,106 --> 00:23:40,304
You never know,
maybe tonight's the night, Doctor.

386
00:23:41,187 --> 00:23:41,988
Imagine it,

387
00:23:42,575 --> 00:23:44,291
seeing Christmas from above.

388
00:23:46,178 --> 00:23:47,835
Well, not just yet, I think.

389
00:23:48,397 --> 00:23:50,113
One day, I will ascend.

390
00:23:50,643 --> 00:23:51,734
One day soon.

391
00:23:53,721 --> 00:23:55,084
You've never actually been up?

392
00:23:55,646 --> 00:23:58,290
He dreams of leaving,
but never does.

393
00:23:58,618 --> 00:24:02,265
I can depart, in the TARDIS,
once London is safe.

394
00:24:04,063 --> 00:24:05,861
And finally, when I'm up there...

395
00:24:06,883 --> 00:24:08,073
Think of it, John.

396
00:24:09,145 --> 00:24:10,672
The time and the space.

397
00:24:12,445 --> 00:24:13,947
The perfect escape.

398
00:24:16,943 --> 00:24:18,920
Do you ever wonder
what you're escaping from?

399
00:24:20,957 --> 00:24:22,263
With every moment.

400
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:24,534
Then do you want me to tell you?

401
00:24:26,219 --> 00:24:27,945
Cos I think I've worked it out now.

402
00:24:29,579 --> 00:24:31,214
How you became The Doctor.

403
00:24:32,715 --> 00:24:33,750
What do you think?

404
00:24:35,491 --> 00:24:36,419
Do you want to know?

405
00:24:40,468 --> 00:24:43,894
Mr Cole, Mr Scoones,
Mr Fetch and Mr Milligan,

406
00:24:44,556 --> 00:24:47,944
you have your instructions and
the Court of the CyberKing is waiting.

407
00:24:48,558 --> 00:24:50,760
First of all, let's just see.

408
00:24:51,529 --> 00:24:52,747
A little test.

409
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:54,716
Turn right.

410
00:24:56,766 --> 00:24:57,700
Turn left.

411
00:25:00,462 --> 00:25:01,774
And face me.

412
00:25:03,761 --> 00:25:05,427
Oh, I could do this forever.

413
00:25:06,033 --> 00:25:06,815
But now,

414
00:25:07,452 --> 00:25:09,433
set about your appointed tasks.

415
00:25:10,608 --> 00:25:11,920
And bring them to me.

416
00:25:25,558 --> 00:25:27,760
The story begins with the Cybermen.

417
00:25:28,514 --> 00:25:29,945
A long time away,

418
00:25:30,203 --> 00:25:33,459
and not so far from here,
the Cybermen were fought

419
00:25:34,874 --> 00:25:35,840
and they were beaten.

420
00:25:36,432 --> 00:25:39,721
And they were sent into a howling
wilderness called The Void,

421
00:25:40,456 --> 00:25:42,240
locked inside forevermore.

422
00:25:42,749 --> 00:25:44,541
But then a greater battle rose up,

423
00:25:46,118 --> 00:25:48,749
so great that everything
inside The Void perished.

424
00:25:49,912 --> 00:25:52,209
But, as the walls of the world weakened,

425
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:56,522
the last of the Cybermen must have
fallen through the dimensions,

426
00:25:56,622 --> 00:25:57,626
back in time,

427
00:25:58,480 --> 00:25:59,607
to land here.

428
00:26:00,242 --> 00:26:03,295
- And they found you.
- I fought them, I know that.

429
00:26:04,974 --> 00:26:05,920
But what happened?

430
00:26:06,468 --> 00:26:08,627
At the same time,
another man came to London.

431
00:26:09,668 --> 00:26:11,000
Mr Jackson Lake.

432
00:26:11,933 --> 00:26:14,053
Plenty of luggage,
money in his pocket. Maybe...

433
00:26:15,258 --> 00:26:17,435
coming to town for the winter season,
I don't know.

434
00:26:19,157 --> 00:26:20,861
But he found the Cybermen too.

435
00:26:22,281 --> 00:26:23,454
And just like you,

436
00:26:24,432 --> 00:26:25,593
exactly like you,

437
00:26:27,196 --> 00:26:28,962
he took hold of an infostamp.

438
00:26:30,085 --> 00:26:31,170
But he's dead.

439
00:26:31,435 --> 00:26:33,922
Jackson Lake is dead.
The Cybermen murdered him.

440
00:26:34,154 --> 00:26:35,952
You said no body was ever found.

441
00:26:37,070 --> 00:26:38,362
And you kept all his suitcases,

442
00:26:38,462 --> 00:26:40,540
but you could never bring
yourself to open them.

443
00:26:42,905 --> 00:26:45,557
I told you the answer
was in the fob watch.

444
00:26:47,216 --> 00:26:48,200
Can I see?

445
00:27:02,050 --> 00:27:02,880
JL.

446
00:27:05,031 --> 00:27:06,646
The watch is Jackson Lake's.

447
00:27:08,798 --> 00:27:10,120
Jackson Lake is...

448
00:27:10,697 --> 00:27:11,751
you, sir?

449
00:27:13,636 --> 00:27:14,803
But I'm The Doctor.

450
00:27:17,169 --> 00:27:18,583
You became The Doctor

451
00:27:19,516 --> 00:27:24,488
because the infostamp you picked up
was a book about one particular man.

452
00:27:27,328 --> 00:27:28,931
The Cybermen's database.

453
00:27:31,532 --> 00:27:33,551
Stolen from the Daleks
inside The Void, I'd say,

454
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:35,760
but it's everything
you could want to know

455
00:27:36,901 --> 00:27:38,080
about The Doctor.

456
00:27:42,650 --> 00:27:43,395
That's you.

457
00:27:45,325 --> 00:27:47,824
Time Lord, TARDIS,
enemy of the Cybermen.

458
00:27:49,597 --> 00:27:50,780
The one and the only.

459
00:27:54,512 --> 00:27:55,376
You see?

460
00:27:55,659 --> 00:27:58,064
The infostamp must have backfired,

461
00:27:59,363 --> 00:28:01,768
streamed all that information about me

462
00:28:02,765 --> 00:28:04,311
right inside your head.

463
00:28:21,346 --> 00:28:22,853
I am nothing but a lie.

464
00:28:23,213 --> 00:28:26,800
No, no, no, no, no. Infostamps
are just facts and figures.

465
00:28:27,490 --> 00:28:28,676
All that bravery,

466
00:28:29,452 --> 00:28:31,825
saving Rosita,
defending London town.

467
00:28:32,828 --> 00:28:36,773
Hmm? And the invention,
building a TARDIS. That's all you.

468
00:28:37,303 --> 00:28:38,394
And what else?

469
00:28:41,612 --> 00:28:43,107
Tell me what else?

470
00:28:44,784 --> 00:28:46,672
There's still something missing,
isn't there?

471
00:28:46,772 --> 00:28:48,320
I demand you tell me, sir.

472
00:28:49,504 --> 00:28:51,182
Tell me what they took.

473
00:28:55,481 --> 00:28:56,231
Sorry.

474
00:28:58,477 --> 00:29:00,004
Really, I am so sorry.

475
00:29:02,667 --> 00:29:05,168
But that's an awful lot
of luggage for one man.

476
00:29:08,525 --> 00:29:12,479
Cos an infostamp is plain technology.
Not enough to make a man lose his mind.

477
00:29:13,755 --> 00:29:16,180
What you suffered
is called a fugue.

478
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:19,115
A fugue state.

479
00:29:20,238 --> 00:29:23,420
Where the mind just runs away,
because it can't bear to look back.

480
00:29:26,816 --> 00:29:28,860
You wanted to become someone else,

481
00:29:30,765 --> 00:29:33,062
because Jackson Lake
had lost so much.

482
00:29:38,032 --> 00:29:39,003
Midnight.

483
00:29:40,291 --> 00:29:41,546
Christmas Day.

484
00:29:44,780 --> 00:29:45,921
I remember...

485
00:29:49,473 --> 00:29:50,905
Oh, my God...

486
00:30:00,776 --> 00:30:01,937
Caroline.

487
00:30:07,407 --> 00:30:08,783
They killed my wife.

488
00:30:13,580 --> 00:30:15,073
They killed her.

489
00:30:36,436 --> 00:30:37,481
Oh...

490
00:30:38,850 --> 00:30:41,910
- You found a whole cache of infostamps.
- But what is it?

491
00:30:42,402 --> 00:30:43,525
What's that noise?

492
00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:47,620
Activation. A call to arms.
The Cybermen are moving!

493
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:00,901
The Doctor needs help.

494
00:31:02,396 --> 00:31:03,917
I learnt that much about him.

495
00:31:04,844 --> 00:31:06,535
There should be someone at his side.

496
00:31:07,727 --> 00:31:08,547
Now go.

497
00:31:10,250 --> 00:31:10,960
Go.

498
00:31:22,432 --> 00:31:24,066
What is it? What's happening?

499
00:31:30,974 --> 00:31:34,236
That's Mr Cole. He's Master
of the Hazel Street Workhouse.

500
00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:38,141
- Maybe he's taking them to prayers.
- Oh, nothing as holy as that.

501
00:31:38,614 --> 00:31:39,681
Can you hear me?

502
00:31:40,540 --> 00:31:41,520
Hello?

503
00:31:42,908 --> 00:31:43,722
No?

504
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:46,960
Mr Cole, you seem to have
something in your ear.

505
00:31:47,268 --> 00:31:49,460
Now, this might hurt a bit,
but if I can just...

506
00:31:51,576 --> 00:31:52,680
They're on guard.

507
00:31:53,545 --> 00:31:55,334
Can't risk a fight.
Not with the children.

508
00:31:55,570 --> 00:31:56,671
But where are they going?

509
00:31:56,771 --> 00:31:58,710
All need a good whipping,
if you ask me.

510
00:31:58,810 --> 00:32:02,729
I've just seen another lot
coming from the Ingleby Workhouse.

511
00:32:02,829 --> 00:32:04,149
- Where's that?
- This way!

512
00:32:15,826 --> 00:32:17,120
Dozens of 'em!

513
00:32:17,693 --> 00:32:18,820
But what for?

514
00:32:54,580 --> 00:32:55,934
You will continue.

515
00:32:56,458 --> 00:32:58,508
You will enter
the Court of the CyberKing.

516
00:33:03,611 --> 00:33:04,840
March.

517
00:33:05,308 --> 00:33:06,703
That is an order.

518
00:33:07,523 --> 00:33:08,488
March!

519
00:33:34,545 --> 00:33:35,642
Where is it?

520
00:33:40,589 --> 00:33:41,674
Where is it?

521
00:33:44,977 --> 00:33:46,388
That's the door to the sluice.

522
00:33:46,488 --> 00:33:48,855
All the sewage runs through there,
straight into the Thames.

523
00:33:48,955 --> 00:33:52,114
Yeah, that's too well guarded.
We'll have to find another way in.

524
00:33:52,486 --> 00:33:55,200
Whoa! That's cheating, sneaking up!

525
00:33:55,725 --> 00:33:57,365
Did you have your legs on silent?

526
00:33:58,135 --> 00:33:58,804
So...

527
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:00,678
what do we have here?

528
00:34:00,778 --> 00:34:03,139
Just walk towards me, slowly.
Don't let them touch you.

529
00:34:03,239 --> 00:34:06,440
Oh, but they wouldn't hurt me,
my fine boys.

530
00:34:06,885 --> 00:34:09,176
They are my knights
in shining armour.

531
00:34:09,441 --> 00:34:10,457
Quite literally.

532
00:34:10,557 --> 00:34:13,240
Even if they've converted you,
that's not a Cyber speech pattern.

533
00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:15,719
You've still got free will.
Step away...

534
00:34:15,819 --> 00:34:17,440
There's been no conversion, sir.

535
00:34:18,096 --> 00:34:19,960
No-one's ever been able
to change my mind.

536
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:24,272
The Cybermen offered me the one
thing I wanted: liberation.

537
00:34:24,575 --> 00:34:26,360
- Who are you?
- You can be quiet.

538
00:34:26,979 --> 00:34:30,544
I doubt he paid you to talk.
More importantly, who are you, sir?

539
00:34:30,644 --> 00:34:33,402
With such intimate knowledge
of my companions.

540
00:34:33,572 --> 00:34:34,680
I'm The Doctor.

541
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:38,762
Incorrect. You do not correspond
to our image of The Doctor.

542
00:34:39,027 --> 00:34:42,559
Yeah, that's cos your database got
corrupted. Oh, look, look, look!

543
00:34:42,837 --> 00:34:44,919
Check this! The Doctor's infostamp.

544
00:34:47,304 --> 00:34:48,730
Plug it in. Go on, download.

545
00:34:49,329 --> 00:34:51,001
The core has been damaged.

546
00:34:51,180 --> 00:34:54,040
This infostamp would
damage Cyberunits.

547
00:34:54,140 --> 00:34:55,493
Oh, well. Nice try.

548
00:34:56,956 --> 00:34:58,780
Core repaired. Download.

549
00:35:09,374 --> 00:35:11,440
- You are The Doctor.
- Hello!

550
00:35:11,540 --> 00:35:12,889
You will be deleted.

551
00:35:12,989 --> 00:35:17,280
Oh, but let me die happy! Tell me:
what d'you need those children for?

552
00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:19,115
What are children ever needed for?

553
00:35:19,336 --> 00:35:21,200
- They're a workforce.
- But for what?

554
00:35:21,561 --> 00:35:23,928
Very soon now,
the whole Empire will see.

555
00:35:24,028 --> 00:35:26,019
And they will bow down, in worship.

556
00:35:26,119 --> 00:35:27,893
And it's all been timed
for Christmas Day.

557
00:35:27,993 --> 00:35:29,314
Was that your idea, Miss...?

558
00:35:29,414 --> 00:35:31,218
Hartigan. Yes.

559
00:35:31,490 --> 00:35:34,717
The perfect day for a birth,
with a new message for the people.

560
00:35:35,247 --> 00:35:37,379
Only this time, it won't be
the words of a man.

561
00:35:37,802 --> 00:35:38,840
The birth of what?

562
00:35:39,335 --> 00:35:40,631
A birth, and a death.

563
00:35:41,101 --> 00:35:42,080
Namely, yours.

564
00:35:42,666 --> 00:35:44,019
Thank you, Doctor.

565
00:35:44,347 --> 00:35:47,029
I'm glad to have been part
of your very last conversation.

566
00:35:47,877 --> 00:35:50,685
- Now, delete them.
- Delete!

567
00:36:05,259 --> 00:36:07,347
- At your service, Doctor.
- Shade!

568
00:36:07,669 --> 00:36:09,063
Sha-a-a-a-a-ade!

569
00:36:09,163 --> 00:36:10,698
- Run! Come on!
- Sha-a-a-a-ade!

570
00:36:10,798 --> 00:36:12,010
One last thing.

571
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:13,442
Oh!

572
00:36:14,004 --> 00:36:15,783
Can I say, I completely disapprove!

573
00:36:15,883 --> 00:36:17,360
- Come on!
- Get off me.

574
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:18,744
I said, get off!

575
00:36:19,973 --> 00:36:23,160
Tell your masters,
we're not waiting till dawn.

576
00:36:23,525 --> 00:36:25,600
The CyberKing will rise...

577
00:36:27,671 --> 00:36:28,826
...tonight!

578
00:36:31,734 --> 00:36:34,146
That stronghold down by the river.
I need to find a way in.

579
00:36:34,246 --> 00:36:35,368
I'm ahead of you!

580
00:36:35,785 --> 00:36:39,187
My wife and I were moving to London so I
could take up a post at the university.

581
00:36:39,287 --> 00:36:42,137
And while my memory
is still not intact, this...

582
00:36:42,794 --> 00:36:45,160
this was in the luggage.
The deeds:

583
00:36:45,526 --> 00:36:47,129
15 Latimer Street.

584
00:36:47,229 --> 00:36:49,615
If I discovered the Cybermen there,
in the cellar, then...

585
00:36:49,715 --> 00:36:52,280
- That might be a way in! Brilliant!
- But there's still more.

586
00:36:53,010 --> 00:36:54,372
I remember the cellar...

587
00:36:55,350 --> 00:36:56,593
and my wife.

588
00:36:59,350 --> 00:37:01,966
But I swear there was
something else in that room.

589
00:37:06,672 --> 00:37:10,752
If we can find that, perhaps that's
the key to defeating these invaders.

590
00:37:11,149 --> 00:37:12,880
So... onwards!

591
00:37:13,256 --> 00:37:15,345
- Maybe you should go back...
- Don't even try!

592
00:37:15,445 --> 00:37:16,234
No.

593
00:37:17,003 --> 00:37:18,200
You have wisdom.

594
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:20,637
If The Doctor is planning to intervene,

595
00:37:20,737 --> 00:37:23,319
then the Ascension
will commence immediately.

596
00:37:23,419 --> 00:37:24,240
Excellent.

597
00:37:25,230 --> 00:37:29,309
And as for you, Mr Cole, Mr Scoones,
Mr Fetch and Mr Milligan,

598
00:37:30,211 --> 00:37:31,649
your work is done.

599
00:37:47,740 --> 00:37:48,811
Children!

600
00:37:49,751 --> 00:37:50,685
Pay attention!

601
00:37:51,795 --> 00:37:54,918
Now let the new
Industrial Revolution begin.

602
00:37:55,713 --> 00:37:57,007
I want to see you work!

603
00:38:29,509 --> 00:38:32,635
Energy levels 60% and rising.

604
00:38:33,335 --> 00:38:36,280
Soon the CyberKing will awake.

605
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:37,411
Then show me.

606
00:38:45,610 --> 00:38:46,349
Delete!

607
00:38:52,509 --> 00:38:53,948
Must've been guarding this.

608
00:38:54,384 --> 00:38:56,749
A Dimension Vault!
Stolen from the Daleks again,

609
00:38:56,900 --> 00:38:59,733
that's how the Cybermen travelled
through time. Jackson, is this it ?

610
00:38:59,833 --> 00:39:01,273
the thing you couldn't remember?

611
00:39:01,635 --> 00:39:02,831
I don't think so.

612
00:39:03,361 --> 00:39:05,000
I'm... I just can't see.

613
00:39:05,784 --> 00:39:08,239
- It's like it's hidden.
- Not enough power. Come on!

614
00:39:08,339 --> 00:39:09,191
Avanti!

615
00:39:13,299 --> 00:39:15,249
Oh, that is magnificent.

616
00:39:19,438 --> 00:39:21,185
That is royalty, indeed.

617
00:39:21,589 --> 00:39:22,947
And that's quite a throne.

618
00:39:23,047 --> 00:39:24,779
Oh, you will look resplendent.

619
00:39:25,123 --> 00:39:28,920
The chair you designate as "throne"
is not intended for me.

620
00:39:29,028 --> 00:39:33,748
My function is to serve the CyberKing,
not to become the CyberKing.

621
00:39:34,284 --> 00:39:35,560
Then who sits there?

622
00:39:41,881 --> 00:39:45,111
No! Now, just...
I think if you remember correctly...

623
00:39:45,211 --> 00:39:46,738
you said I was to be heralded.

624
00:39:46,838 --> 00:39:48,903
All hail the CyberKing.

625
00:39:49,003 --> 00:39:50,809
"All hail the CyberKing."

626
00:39:50,909 --> 00:39:53,240
But you promised
I would never be converted!

627
00:39:53,340 --> 00:39:56,004
That was designated a "lie".

628
00:39:56,104 --> 00:39:57,487
What do the Cybermen want?

629
00:39:57,587 --> 00:39:58,715
They want us.

630
00:39:59,038 --> 00:40:02,976
That's what Cybermen are: human beings
with their brains put into metal shells.

631
00:40:03,190 --> 00:40:05,199
They want every living thing
to be like them.

632
00:40:06,146 --> 00:40:07,836
You can't do this to me!

633
00:40:08,354 --> 00:40:10,379
Incorrect. It is done.

634
00:40:10,877 --> 00:40:12,860
But I would have served you anyway!

635
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:16,550
Your mind is riven with anger
and abuse and revenge.

636
00:40:16,897 --> 00:40:20,468
These have no place in a Cybermind.
Activate!

637
00:40:22,985 --> 00:40:26,020
Emotions have tormented you
all of your life.

638
00:40:26,335 --> 00:40:30,234
Now you will be set free.
This is your liberation.

639
00:40:30,638 --> 00:40:32,782
For the love of God!
Have you no pity?

640
00:40:34,460 --> 00:40:35,300
Correct.

641
00:40:45,174 --> 00:40:47,358
A CyberKing is born.

642
00:40:47,458 --> 00:40:49,860
"All hail the CyberKing."

643
00:41:11,390 --> 00:41:13,453
- 'Pon my soul...
- What is it?

644
00:41:14,349 --> 00:41:15,353
It's an engine.

645
00:41:28,471 --> 00:41:30,800
They're generating electricity.
But what for?

646
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:32,162
We can set them free!

647
00:41:32,502 --> 00:41:33,780
No, no, no, no, no, no, no...

648
00:41:42,525 --> 00:41:44,228
Behold, such...

649
00:41:44,783 --> 00:41:46,054
information!

650
00:41:49,807 --> 00:41:51,198
Power at 90%!

651
00:41:51,298 --> 00:41:54,876
But if we stop the engine, the power
dies down, Cybermen will come running.

652
00:41:55,898 --> 00:41:58,479
Hold on. Power fluctuation.
That's not meant to happen.

653
00:41:58,763 --> 00:42:01,318
- It's going wrong?
- No, it's weird.

654
00:42:01,848 --> 00:42:03,720
The software's rewriting itself.

655
00:42:04,756 --> 00:42:05,625
It's changing.

656
00:42:06,212 --> 00:42:09,247
I can see the stars, the worlds beyond,

657
00:42:09,789 --> 00:42:13,560
the Vortex of Time itself
and the whole of infinity.

658
00:42:13,789 --> 00:42:15,487
Oh, but this is glorious!

659
00:42:15,701 --> 00:42:19,067
That is incorrect.
"Glorious" is an emotional response.

660
00:42:19,262 --> 00:42:22,650
Exactly! There is so much joy
in this machine.

661
00:42:22,802 --> 00:42:24,669
Joy is not acceptable.

662
00:42:24,871 --> 00:42:25,975
Don't you see?

663
00:42:26,524 --> 00:42:28,688
My mind is stronger
than you ever thought!

664
00:42:28,788 --> 00:42:31,994
It dominates, sir!
It dominates you!

665
00:42:32,094 --> 00:42:35,403
Alert! You are operating beyond
the standard parameters.

666
00:42:35,503 --> 00:42:40,230
I am new.The might of your technology
combined with my own imagination.

667
00:42:40,330 --> 00:42:41,152
Yes!

668
00:42:41,883 --> 00:42:45,720
There will be a new race
of Cybermen. MY Cybermen!

669
00:42:45,820 --> 00:42:49,416
Logic and strength combined
with fury and passion!

670
00:42:49,617 --> 00:42:51,630
Diagnosis system failure!

671
00:42:51,876 --> 00:42:53,826
You will be removed
from the processor.

672
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:04,552
Whoa! What the hell's happening?
It's out of control!

673
00:43:04,652 --> 00:43:05,554
It's accelerating.

674
00:43:05,939 --> 00:43:07,372
96%, 97...

675
00:43:07,472 --> 00:43:10,295
When it reaches 100,
what about the children?

676
00:43:10,395 --> 00:43:12,123
They're disposable. Come on!

677
00:43:15,657 --> 00:43:17,322
I am CyberKing.

678
00:43:18,075 --> 00:43:20,523
My mind inside the Cybermen.

679
00:43:21,476 --> 00:43:22,965
And you will obey me!

680
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:25,571
"All hail the CyberKing!"

681
00:43:27,741 --> 00:43:30,040
Power levels now at 100%.

682
00:43:30,140 --> 00:43:31,780
Delete the workforce.

683
00:43:33,645 --> 00:43:34,314
Delete.

684
00:43:36,408 --> 00:43:37,392
Delete.

685
00:43:38,696 --> 00:43:39,640
Delete.

686
00:43:40,797 --> 00:43:43,280
Right. Now! All of you, out!

687
00:43:44,438 --> 00:43:45,640
That's an order!

688
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:47,745
Every single one of you, run!

689
00:43:47,845 --> 00:43:50,095
All of you, come on!
As fast as you can, come on!

690
00:43:50,824 --> 00:43:52,856
There's a hot pie for everyone,
if you leg it!

691
00:43:53,077 --> 00:43:53,828
Go!

692
00:43:54,345 --> 00:43:55,639
Get them out of the sluice gate!

693
00:43:55,739 --> 00:43:58,073
Once you're out, keep running!
Far as you can!

694
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:02,307
Come on, come on, come on.

695
00:44:08,434 --> 00:44:09,620
Turn right at the corner!

696
00:44:09,796 --> 00:44:11,960
Fast as you can, and don't stop!

697
00:44:12,342 --> 00:44:14,576
Keep running, keep running!

698
00:44:15,017 --> 00:44:16,400
Come, my soldiers.

699
00:44:16,645 --> 00:44:17,667
Come to me.

700
00:44:22,570 --> 00:44:24,340
Come on, come on!

701
00:44:25,454 --> 00:44:27,140
Keep running! Keep running!

702
00:44:34,089 --> 00:44:35,500
Go! Quick, quick.

703
00:44:38,524 --> 00:44:41,180
It's some sort of starter motor,
but starting what?

704
00:44:59,944 --> 00:45:01,105
No!

705
00:45:05,707 --> 00:45:07,340
Help!

706
00:45:12,151 --> 00:45:14,479
Father!

707
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:23,169
Father! Father...

708
00:45:23,269 --> 00:45:24,780
That's my son...

709
00:45:27,484 --> 00:45:28,645
My son.

710
00:45:29,623 --> 00:45:31,087
- Doctor, my son!
- What?!

711
00:45:32,038 --> 00:45:33,244
They took my son.

712
00:45:33,590 --> 00:45:36,745
No wonder my mind escaped!
Those damned Cybermen took my child.

713
00:45:36,947 --> 00:45:39,037
But he's alive, Doctor! Frederic!

714
00:45:39,137 --> 00:45:40,110
Come on!

715
00:45:40,646 --> 00:45:41,941
No, he's too scared.

716
00:45:42,041 --> 00:45:45,120
Stay there! Don't move! I'm coming.

717
00:45:46,766 --> 00:45:49,364
CyberKing rising.

718
00:45:56,620 --> 00:45:58,515
I can't get up there. Fred!

719
00:45:58,615 --> 00:46:00,709
They've finished the motor.
It's going to blow up.

720
00:46:00,809 --> 00:46:02,594
What are we going to do, Doctor?!

721
00:46:02,694 --> 00:46:03,899
Come on, Jackson.

722
00:46:08,386 --> 00:46:09,490
You know me.

723
00:46:15,913 --> 00:46:18,080
Oh, that's it. Hello!

724
00:46:18,180 --> 00:46:20,540
Now, hold on tight. Don't let go.

725
00:46:44,283 --> 00:46:45,513
Merry Christmas!

726
00:46:51,352 --> 00:46:54,480
Go to St Stephen's. Ask for the
Warden, he'll take care of you.

727
00:46:55,087 --> 00:46:56,700
Now run! Quickly!

728
00:47:10,609 --> 00:47:13,426
It's under the water!
There's something in the Thames!

729
00:47:24,601 --> 00:47:25,724
Head for the street.

730
00:47:29,140 --> 00:47:31,615
- Come on, Doctor! Hurry up!
- Gotcha!

731
00:47:37,078 --> 00:47:39,265
Behold! I am risen!

732
00:47:40,048 --> 00:47:43,900
Witness me, mankind,
as CyberKing of all!

733
00:47:47,130 --> 00:47:48,455
It's a CyberKing.

734
00:47:49,111 --> 00:47:50,216
And a CyberKing is what?

735
00:47:50,316 --> 00:47:51,704
It's a ship! Dreadnought class!

736
00:47:51,862 --> 00:47:53,240
Front line of an invasion.

737
00:47:53,433 --> 00:47:55,450
And inside the chest,
a Cyberfactory,

738
00:47:55,550 --> 00:47:57,280
ready to convert millions!

739
00:47:57,769 --> 00:47:59,140
And I will walk!

740
00:47:59,737 --> 00:48:04,860
I will stride across
this tiny little world!

741
00:48:19,779 --> 00:48:20,870
My people.

742
00:48:22,391 --> 00:48:24,069
Why do they not rejoice?

743
00:48:32,914 --> 00:48:35,049
Take him south, go to the parkland.

744
00:48:35,149 --> 00:48:36,520
- Where're you going?
- Stop that thing.

745
00:48:36,620 --> 00:48:37,605
I should be with you!

746
00:48:37,705 --> 00:48:40,383
Jackson, you've got your son.
You've got a reason to live.

747
00:48:40,483 --> 00:48:41,429
And you haven't?

748
00:48:45,978 --> 00:48:47,503
God save you, Doctor.

749
00:49:05,353 --> 00:49:09,769
- What the hell is that thing, sir?
- Oh, good man. Jed, wasn't it?

750
00:49:10,028 --> 00:49:12,141
- Jed, I need your help!
- I'm not going out there!

751
00:49:12,241 --> 00:49:13,851
I'll give you five pound notes!

752
00:49:15,277 --> 00:49:17,751
Um... All right.
What d'you want me to do? 

753
00:49:17,851 --> 00:49:19,712
The TARDIS is gonna fly!

754
00:49:26,797 --> 00:49:29,290
People of the world! Now hear me.

755
00:49:30,135 --> 00:49:32,583
Your governments will surrender.

756
00:49:33,826 --> 00:49:34,880
And if not,

757
00:49:35,668 --> 00:49:37,620
then behold my power!

758
00:49:58,048 --> 00:50:00,962
- You're flamin' bonkers, sir!
- It's been said before! Now gimme.

759
00:50:01,322 --> 00:50:02,787
Not enough power, come on!

760
00:50:02,887 --> 00:50:04,220
Jed! Let her loose!

761
00:50:06,098 --> 00:50:08,929
- Ever flown one of these before?
- Nope! Never!

762
00:50:10,604 --> 00:50:12,762
- Can I have my money now?
- Oh, get on with it!

763
00:50:18,860 --> 00:50:23,054
- Oh, sir. I thought I'd lost you.
- My son, Rosita. This boy is my son.

764
00:50:39,567 --> 00:50:41,429
Good luck to you, sir!

765
00:50:48,661 --> 00:50:52,125
It's the TARDIS. She's flying!

766
00:51:04,631 --> 00:51:07,483
- Who the 'ell is that?!
- His name, sir...

767
00:51:09,491 --> 00:51:10,841
..is The Doctor!

768
00:51:18,900 --> 00:51:21,560
Attention. Proximity alert!

769
00:51:21,660 --> 00:51:23,135
How is that even possible?

770
00:51:23,911 --> 00:51:26,378
Oh, this I would see. TURN!

771
00:51:43,899 --> 00:51:46,094
Excellent. The Doctor!

772
00:51:46,605 --> 00:51:49,671
Yet another man come to assert
himself against me in the night.

773
00:51:50,094 --> 00:51:51,320
Miss Hartigan!

774
00:51:51,831 --> 00:51:53,200
I'm offering you a choice.

775
00:51:53,648 --> 00:51:57,402
You might have the most remarkable
mind this world has ever seen.

776
00:51:57,762 --> 00:52:00,240
Strong enough to control
the Cybermen themselves!

777
00:52:00,506 --> 00:52:02,511
I don't need you to sanction me.

778
00:52:02,801 --> 00:52:05,640
No, but such a mind
deserves to live!

779
00:52:06,032 --> 00:52:08,760
The Cybermen came to this world
using a Dimension Vault.

780
00:52:09,009 --> 00:52:13,280
I can use that device to find you
a home, with no people to convert,

781
00:52:13,688 --> 00:52:18,000
but a new world where you can live
out your mechanical life in peace.

782
00:52:18,374 --> 00:52:19,940
I have the world below.

783
00:52:20,462 --> 00:52:24,406
And it is abundant with so many minds,
ready to become extensions of me.

784
00:52:24,506 --> 00:52:26,140
Why would I leave this place?

785
00:52:26,348 --> 00:52:27,526
Because if you don't,

786
00:52:28,317 --> 00:52:29,560
I'll have to stop you.

787
00:52:30,137 --> 00:52:32,822
What do you make of me, sir?
An idiot?

788
00:52:33,510 --> 00:52:34,132
No.

789
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:37,558
The question is,
what do you make of me?

790
00:52:43,017 --> 00:52:44,254
Destroy him!

791
00:52:44,557 --> 00:52:45,945
You make me into this.

792
00:53:04,412 --> 00:53:06,080
Then I have made you a failure.

793
00:53:06,488 --> 00:53:08,759
Your weapons are useless, sir.

794
00:53:08,948 --> 00:53:10,639
I wasn't trying to kill you.

795
00:53:11,743 --> 00:53:14,076
All I did was break
the Cyber-connection,

796
00:53:15,483 --> 00:53:16,928
leaving your mind open.

797
00:53:18,581 --> 00:53:19,407
Open,

798
00:53:20,732 --> 00:53:23,369
I think, for the first time
in far too many years.

799
00:53:24,379 --> 00:53:25,647
So you can see.

800
00:53:27,369 --> 00:53:28,770
Just look at yourself.

801
00:53:29,350 --> 00:53:30,631
Look at what you've done.

802
00:53:32,347 --> 00:53:33,780
I'm sorry, Miss Hartigan.

803
00:53:34,826 --> 00:53:36,233
But look at what you've become.

804
00:53:42,732 --> 00:53:43,760
I'm so sorry.

805
00:54:00,956 --> 00:54:03,763
He's killed it.
Whatever he did, he's killed it!

806
00:54:08,254 --> 00:54:09,515
But it's gonna fall!

807
00:54:31,428 --> 00:54:32,242
Oh!

808
00:54:33,131 --> 00:54:34,166
Now you're ready!

809
00:55:05,442 --> 00:55:07,083
I'd say he used that Dimension Vault

810
00:55:07,183 --> 00:55:09,997
to transfer the wreckage
of the CyberKing into the Time Vortex,

811
00:55:10,180 --> 00:55:11,998
there to be harmlessly disintegrated.

812
00:55:12,711 --> 00:55:14,957
Oh, I've picked up a lot.

813
00:55:15,576 --> 00:55:16,960
But here...

814
00:55:17,431 --> 00:55:18,706
Ladies and gentlemen,

815
00:55:19,557 --> 00:55:20,880
I know that man...

816
00:55:21,299 --> 00:55:22,680
That Doctor on high.

817
00:55:23,135 --> 00:55:26,760
And I know that he has done this
deed a thousand times! But not once.

818
00:55:27,065 --> 00:55:31,411
Not once, no sir, not ever,
has he ever been thanked!

819
00:55:32,074 --> 00:55:36,440
But no more! For I say to you,
on this Christmas morn,

820
00:55:36,686 --> 00:55:40,457
"Bravo, sir! Bravo!"

821
00:55:55,240 --> 00:55:56,620
Bravo, sir!

822
00:56:11,852 --> 00:56:13,107
Bravo, Doctor.

823
00:56:25,900 --> 00:56:29,122
The city will recover,
as London always does.

824
00:56:30,584 --> 00:56:32,359
Though the events of today
will be history,

825
00:56:32,459 --> 00:56:35,128
- spoken of for centuries to come!
- Yeah.

826
00:56:35,936 --> 00:56:36,851
Funny that.

827
00:56:37,646 --> 00:56:39,702
And a new history begins for me.

828
00:56:40,769 --> 00:56:43,236
I find myself a widower,
but with my son

829
00:56:43,961 --> 00:56:45,248
and with a good friend.

830
00:56:45,816 --> 00:56:48,239
Now, take care of that one.
She's marvellous.

831
00:56:48,964 --> 00:56:51,520
Frederic will need a nursemaid
and I can think of none better.

832
00:56:54,871 --> 00:56:56,341
But you're welcome to join us.

833
00:56:56,883 --> 00:56:59,750
We thought we might all dine
together, at the Traveller's Halt.

834
00:57:00,917 --> 00:57:02,841
A Christmas feast, in celebration...

835
00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:07,554
..and in memory
of those we have lost.

836
00:57:11,900 --> 00:57:12,941
You won't stay?

837
00:57:15,111 --> 00:57:16,300
Like I said, "You know me."

838
00:57:18,796 --> 00:57:19,585
No...

839
00:57:21,343 --> 00:57:22,945
I don't think anyone does.

840
00:57:24,617 --> 00:57:25,240
Oh!

841
00:57:26,049 --> 00:57:27,027
And this is it!

842
00:57:27,380 --> 00:57:28,043
Oh!

843
00:57:28,415 --> 00:57:31,000
Oh, if I might, Doctor?
One last adventure?

844
00:57:31,594 --> 00:57:33,733
Oh, be my guest.

845
00:57:39,613 --> 00:57:40,446
Oh...

846
00:57:44,540 --> 00:57:45,884
Oh, my word.

847
00:57:48,957 --> 00:57:51,140
Oh, goodness me.

848
00:57:54,270 --> 00:57:55,367
But this is...

849
00:57:57,576 --> 00:57:58,787
But this is nonsense!

850
00:58:00,251 --> 00:58:01,754
Well, that's one word for it!

851
00:58:03,193 --> 00:58:05,754
Complete and utter,
wonderful nonsense!

852
00:58:06,221 --> 00:58:08,171
How very, very silly!

853
00:58:10,385 --> 00:58:12,255
Oh, no. I can't bear it!

854
00:58:13,075 --> 00:58:14,413
Oh, it's causing my head to ache.

855
00:58:14,513 --> 00:58:16,538
No, no, no, no, no, no, no...

856
00:58:17,510 --> 00:58:19,280
Oh! Oh, gracious.

857
00:58:20,386 --> 00:58:21,415
That's quite enough.

858
00:58:27,699 --> 00:58:29,200
I take it this is goodbye.

859
00:58:30,311 --> 00:58:31,232
Onwards and upwards.

860
00:58:31,958 --> 00:58:33,137
Tell me one thing.

861
00:58:34,064 --> 00:58:36,406
All those facts and figures
I saw of The Doctor's life,

862
00:58:36,506 --> 00:58:37,718
you were never alone.

863
00:58:38,292 --> 00:58:40,317
All those bright
and shining companions!

864
00:58:41,573 --> 00:58:42,847
But not any more?

865
00:58:43,649 --> 00:58:44,261
No.

866
00:58:45,100 --> 00:58:46,060
Might I ask, why not?

867
00:58:46,816 --> 00:58:47,640
They leave.

868
00:58:49,863 --> 00:58:52,141
Because they should.
Or they find someone else.

869
00:58:54,424 --> 00:58:55,875
And some of them, some of them...

870
00:58:57,636 --> 00:58:58,443
forget me.

871
00:59:01,043 --> 00:59:02,330
I suppose, in the end...

872
00:59:09,126 --> 00:59:10,558
..they break my heart.

873
00:59:15,482 --> 00:59:16,996
That offer of Christmas dinner.

874
00:59:17,204 --> 00:59:19,460
It's no longer a request.
It's a demand!

875
00:59:21,122 --> 00:59:22,655
In memory of those we have lost.

876
00:59:26,922 --> 00:59:30,058
- Ohh, go on then!
- Really?!

877
00:59:30,158 --> 00:59:32,900
Just this once. You've actually
gone and changed my mind.

878
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:34,360
Not many people can do that!

879
00:59:35,206 --> 00:59:35,957
Jackson...

880
00:59:37,196 --> 00:59:39,480
if anyone had to be The Doctor,
I'm glad it was you.

881
00:59:40,350 --> 00:59:44,093
The feast awaits. Come with me!
Walk this way.

882
00:59:44,193 --> 00:59:45,488
I certainly will!

883
00:59:46,838 --> 00:59:48,415
Merry Christmas to you, Jackson.

884
00:59:49,246 --> 00:59:50,990
Merry Christmas, indeed, Doctor!
