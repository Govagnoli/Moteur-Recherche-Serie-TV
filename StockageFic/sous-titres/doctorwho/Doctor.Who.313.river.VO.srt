1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,040
The Master is Prime Minister.

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:04,080
And these are my friends.

3
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:06,240
They're called the Toclafane.
What?!

4
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:08,360
Tell us who he is. He's a Time Lord.

5
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:11,320
He's cannibalised the TARDIS,
it's a Paradox Machine.

6
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:13,680
We meet at last, Doctor.

7
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:16,120
Stop this, stop it now!

8
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,280
We can't stop him.

9
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:24,080
Down you go, kids, remove one tenth
of the population. I'm coming back.

10
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:25,920
And the Earth was no more.

11
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:09,400
'Spacelane traffic is advised
to stay away from Sol 3,
also known as Earth.

12
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:14,760
'Pilots are warned Sol 3 is
now entering Terminal Extinction.

13
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:18,600
'Planet Earth is closed.

14
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:21,720
'Planet Earth is closed...'

15
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,760
What's your name? Tom Milligan.

16
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:59,640
No need to ask who you are,
the famous Martha Jones.

17
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:03,520
How long since you were
last in Britain? 365 days.

18
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:06,240
It's been a long year.
What's the plan?

19
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:09,520
I must see Professor Docherty,
can you get me there?

20
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:13,280
She works in a repair shed, Nuclear
Plant Seven, I'll get you inside.

21
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:15,120
What's so important about her?

22
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:18,040
The more you know,
the more you're at risk.

23
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:27,560
A lot of people depend on you.
You're a legend. What does the
legend say?

24
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:30,280
Martha Jones, she's
gonna save the world.

25
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:35,640
Bit late for that. How come you can
drive, don't you get stopped?

26
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:39,120
Medical staff. Used to be in
paediatrics in the old days.

27
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:43,240
Gives me a licence to travel,
I help out at labour camps. Great.

28
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46,040
I'm travelling with a doctor(!)

29
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:52,080
Story goes, you're the only person
on Earth who can kill him.

30
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:55,280
That you alone can kill the Master
stone dead.

31
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:56,840
Let's just drive.

32
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,680
Citizens rejoice!

33
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:10,200
Your Lord and Master stands on high!

34
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:13,680
Playing Track Three...

35
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:17,480
SCISSOR SISTERS: # I can decide
whether you should live or die

36
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:19,720
# Oh, you'll probably go to heaven

37
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,880
# Please don't hang your head and cry

38
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:25,360
# I wonder why
my heart feels dead inside

39
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,880
# It's cold and hard and petrified

40
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:30,360
# Lock the doors and close the blinds

41
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,120
# We're going for a ride

42
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:34,560
# Oh, I could throw you in the lake

43
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,960
# Or feed you poisoned birthday cake

44
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,080
# I won't deny I'm gonna miss you
when you're gone

45
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,480
# Oh, I could bury you alive

46
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:46,880
# But you might crawl out
with a knife

47
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:50,640
# And kill me when
I'm sleeping, that's why...

48
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:54,320
# I can't decide whether you should
live or die

49
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:59,320
# Oh, you'll probably go to heaven
Please don't hang your head and cry

50
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,280
# I wonder why my heart feels dead
inside

51
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:04,720
# It's cold and hard and petrified

52
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:06,680
# Lock the doors and... #

53
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:09,840
It's ready to rise, Doctor.

54
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:12,520
The new Time Lord Empire.

55
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,280
It's good, isn't it?

56
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:16,480
Anything?

57
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:18,680
No? Anything?

58
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:26,600
Ohh, but they broke your heart,
didn't they? Those Toclafane.

59
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:31,720
Ever since you worked out what they
really are. They say...

60
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:34,800
Martha Jones has come back home.

61
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:37,360
Now why would she do that?

62
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:41,000
Leave her alone. But you said
something to her.

63
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,560
The day I took control.

64
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:50,280
What did you tell her?
I have one thing to say to you.

65
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:53,240
You know what it is...
Ohh, no, you don't!

66
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:58,080
'Valiant now entering
Zone One airspace. Citizens rejoice.'

67
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:00,680
Come on, people! What are we doing?

68
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:05,800
Launch Day in 24 hours!

69
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,560
Morning, Tish!

70
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:26,080
Ah! Smell that sea air!

71
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:29,840
Makes me long for good old British
fish and chips.

72
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:31,640
And what do I get?

73
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:36,120
Cold mashed swede. Some hotel!
Last time I book on the Internet.

74
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:45,560
All over the Earth, those things.
He's even carved himself
into Mount Rushmore.

75
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,640
Best to keep down.

76
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,880
Here we go...

77
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:53,600
The entire south coast of England.

78
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:59,160
Converted into shipyards. They
bring in slave labour every morning.

79
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:02,120
Break up cars, houses,
just for the metal.

80
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,920
Building the fleet out of scrap.

81
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:10,160
You should see Russia.
That's Shipyard Number One.

82
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:15,840
Black Sea to the Bering Strait,
100, 000 rockets ready for war. War,
with who? The rest of the universe.

83
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:18,840
I've been out in space.
Before all this.

84
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:23,760
And there's a thousand civilisations
with no idea of what's happening.

85
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,160
The Master can build weapons
to devastate them all.

86
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:30,520
You've been in space?
Problem with that? Nope! No, just...

87
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:33,760
Wow. Anything else I should know?

88
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:36,000
I've met Shakespeare.

89
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,560
Identify, little man.

90
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:47,480
I've got a licence! Milligan,
Peripatetic Medical Squad,
I may travel.

91
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,280
I was just checking for...

92
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:53,440
Soon the rockets will fly!
And everyone will need medicine!

93
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,560
You'll be so busy!

94
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,680
TOCLAFANE LAUGH

95
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:06,440
But...they didn't see you.

96
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:10,400
How d'you think I travelled
the world?

97
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:14,160
The Master set up Archangel that
mobile-phone network, 15 satellites.

98
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:17,280
It transmits a low-level psychic
field. That's how everyone

99
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:21,520
got hypnotised into thinking he was
Harold Saxon. Feels like years ago.

100
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:28,800
But the key's tuned into the same
frequency, makes me sort of...not
invisible, just unnoticeable.

101
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:34,680
I could see you. That's cos you
wanted to. Yeah, I suppose I did.

102
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,600
Is there a Mrs Milligan?

103
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:38,800
No. No, what about you?

104
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:40,960
There used to be someone.

105
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:52,160
Long time ago.

106
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:57,560
I must find this Docherty woman.
We'll wait till the next work shift,
what time is it?

107
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,680
It's nearly three o'clock.

108
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,960
Time for my massage!
Who shall I have? Tanya!

109
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,680
Lucy, have you met Tanya?

110
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,200
She's gorgeous!

111
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:34,800
Tanya, when we go to the stars,
I'm going to take you to the
Catrigan Nova. Whirlpools of gold.

112
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:43,640
You two should get to know each
other. That might be fun!

113
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:44,920
Oh!

114
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,440
What the hell? 'Condition red,
condition red!'

115
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,040
Ohh, I see. I told you.

116
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:15,160
I have one thing to say...

117
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,080
Ohhhh, here we go again.

118
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:33,240
Isomorphic controls.

119
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:38,560
Which means, they only work for me.

120
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,800
Like this!

121
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,280
Say sorry! Sorry, sorry, sorry.

122
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:49,400
Didn't you learn anything
from the blessed Saint Martha?

123
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,800
Siding with the Doctor

124
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:58,040
is a very dangerous thing to do.
Take them away!

125
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:02,560
Move! Come on. OK, gotcha.

126
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,280
There you go, Gramps.

127
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:11,400
Oh, d'you know,
I remember the days when the Doctor,

128
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:14,160
oh, that famous Doctor, was waging

129
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:19,680
a Time War, battling Sea Devils,
and Axons,

130
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:23,920
he sealed the rift at
the Medusa Cascade, single-handed!

131
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:27,560
And look at him now.

132
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,600
Stealing screwdrivers.

133
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:32,160
How did he ever come to this?

134
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:34,360
Oh, yeah! Me!

135
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,000
I just...

136
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,840
need you to listen...

137
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:43,120
No, it's MY turn. Revenge!

138
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:46,760
Best served hot! And this time...

139
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:50,400
It's a message for Miss Jones.

140
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:06,520
Professor Docherty? Busy!

141
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:10,280
They sent word, I'm Tom Milligan.
This is Martha Jones.

142
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:15,120
She can be the Queen of Sheba, I'm
still busy. TVs don't work any more.

143
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:17,040
Oh, God, I miss Countdown.

144
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:20,400
Never been the same since
Des took over. Both Deses.

145
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:22,240
What's the plural? Desii?

146
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:25,880
Deseen? But we've been told
there's going to be a transmission.

147
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,480
From the man himself.
There!

148
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:33,400
'My people!

149
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:37,200
'Salutations on this,
the eve of war.

150
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,560
'Lovely woman.

151
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:44,400
'But I know there's all sorts of
whispers, stories of a child,
walking the Earth.

152
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:46,960
'Giving you hope.

153
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:50,240
'But I ask you...

154
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:54,120
'how much hope has this man got?

155
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,480
'Say hello, Gandalf!

156
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:59,280
'Except...he's not that old!

157
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:02,960
'But he's an alien.
With a much greater

158
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,640
'lifespan than you stunted little
apes,

159
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:08,160
'what if it showed?'

160
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:11,240
What if I suspend
your capacity to regenerate?

161
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:18,880
All 900 years of your life,
Doctor. What if we could see them?

162
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:28,600
Older and older and older...

163
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:33,200
Down, you go, Doctor!

164
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:39,760
Down, down, down the years.

165
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:56,280
Doctor...

166
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:32,360
'Received and understood,
Miss Jones?'

167
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:36,880
I'm sorry.

168
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,400
The Doctor's still alive.

169
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:49,880
The Archangel network seems to be
the Master's greatest weakness...

170
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:54,000
15 satellites, all around the Earth,
still transmitting.

171
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:56,440
That's why there's no resistance,

172
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:01,120
it's broadcasting a telepathic
signal that keeps people scared.

173
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:02,880
We could take them out.

174
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:08,960
We could, 15 ground-to-air missiles,
got any? Any military action,
the Toclafane descend.

175
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,280
They're not Toclafane.
The Master made that up.

176
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:15,560
Then what are they? That's why I
came to you. Know your enemy.

177
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,840
I've got this...

178
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:24,240
No-one's been able to see a Sphere
close up, they can't even be damaged.

179
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:30,640
The lightning strike in South Africa
brought one down. By chance. I've got
the readings. On this.

180
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:35,720
Oh! Whoever thought we'd miss
Bill Gates?

181
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:39,600
Is that why you travelled the world?
To find a disc? No, just got lucky.

182
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:43,800
I heard you walked the Earth to
find a way to build a weapon.

183
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:52,000
There! A current of 58.5
kilo amperes,

184
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:55,560
transferred charge of
510 mega joules precisely.

185
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:59,120
Can you recreate that?
I think so. Easily, yes.

186
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:01,480
Right then, Dr Milligan.

187
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:03,880
We're gonna get us a Sphere.

188
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:35,760
He's coming...you ready? You do your
job, I'll do mine.

189
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:37,760
Now!

190
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:53,800
That's only half the job.

191
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:56,800
Let's find out what's inside.

192
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:11,920
I'm gonna kill him.
If I have to wait a hundred years.

193
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:14,480
I'm going to kill the Master.

194
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:17,680
One day, he'll let his guard down.
One day.

195
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:19,600
And I'll be there.

196
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:21,520
No, that's my job.

197
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:27,440
I swear to you,
I'd shoot that man stone dead.

198
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,480
I'll get him.

199
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:37,560
Even if it kills me.
Don't say that. I mean it.

200
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:42,000
That man made us stand on deck and
watch the islands of Japan burning.

201
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:44,000
Millions of people.

202
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:47,960
I swear to you. He's dead.

203
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,120
Tomorrow, they launch.

204
00:16:56,440 --> 00:17:00,080
We're opening up a rift in
the Braccatolian space.

205
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:06,120
Won't see us coming. Kind of scary.
Then stop.

206
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:12,360
Once the Empire is established,
and there's a New Gallifrey in
the heavens...

207
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,080
maybe then, it stops.

208
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:24,680
The drumming.
The never-ending drumbeat.

209
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,840
'Ever since I was a child.
I looked into the Vortex.

210
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:33,200
'That's when it chose me. The
drumming, the call to war.'

211
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:34,840
Can't you hear it?

212
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:39,440
Listen. It's there now, right now.

213
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:42,080
Tell me you can hear it, Doctor.

214
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,720
Tell me. It's only you.

215
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,640
Good.

216
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,720
Tomorrow, the War!

217
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:55,400
Tomorrow, we rise, never to fall!

218
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,960
You see?

219
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,360
I'm doing it for them.
You should be grateful.

220
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,520
After all, you love them.

221
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:04,720
So very, very much.

222
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:12,200
There's some sort of magnetic clamp,
hold on... I'll just trip the...

223
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:26,760
Oh, my God...!

224
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:37,560
THEY GASP
It's alive!

225
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:41,040
Martha. Martha Jones.

226
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:46,520
It knows you. Sweet kind Martha
Jones. You helped us to fly.

227
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:50,200
What d'you mean? You led us to
salvation.

228
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:53,800
Who are you?
The skies are made of diamonds.

229
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:58,360
No... You can't be him.
'The skies are made of diamonds.'

230
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:05,520
We share each other's memories. You
sent him to Utopia. Oh, my God.

231
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:07,160
What's it talking about?

232
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,720
What are they? Martha.

233
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:11,400
Martha, tell us. What are they?

234
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:15,840
They're us. They're humans.

235
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:18,440
The human race, from the future.

236
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:29,280
I took Lucy to Utopia.

237
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:31,440
Isn't that right, sweetheart?

238
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:34,360
Trillions of years into the future.

239
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,560
To the end of the universe.

240
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:38,720
Tell him what you saw. Dying.

241
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,480
Everything, dying.

242
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:42,960
The whole of creation falling apart.

243
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,360
And I thought...there's no point.

244
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:49,160
No point to anything. Not ever.
And it's all your fault.

245
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:52,920
MARTHA: I'd sort of worked it
out with the Paradox Machine.

246
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:56,440
The Doctor said the day before the
Master came to power...

247
00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:00,360
When he stole the TARDIS, all I
could do was fuse the coordinates.

248
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:04,760
I locked them permanently.

249
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:08,680
He could only travel between the
year one hundred trillion and the
last place the TARDIS landed.

250
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,480
Which is right here, right now.

251
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:16,640
The Master had the TARDIS, this time
machine. But the only place he could
go was the end of the universe.

252
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:18,320
So he found Utopia.

253
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:23,440
You should have seen it, Doctor.
Furnaces. Burning.

254
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:26,720
The last of humanity,
screaming at the dark.

255
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:30,160
The Utopia Project was the last hope.

256
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:34,200
Trying to find a way to escape
the end of everything.

257
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:36,440
There was no solution. No diamonds.

258
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,360
Just the dark and the cold.

259
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:45,520
Human invention that had sustained
them across the aeons turned inward.
They cannibalised themselves.

260
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:47,280
We made ourselves so pretty.

261
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:51,960
Regressing into children.
But it didn't work. The universe
was collapsing around them.

262
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,160
But then the Master came.
With his wonderful Time Machine!

263
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,760
To bring us back home.

264
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:58,280
But that's a paradox!

265
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:01,440
If you're the future and you've come
back to murder your ancestors,

266
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:05,640
you should cancel yourselves out,
you shouldn't exist.

267
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:07,400
That's the Paradox Machine.

268
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:17,080
My masterpiece, Doctor,
a living TARDIS, strong enough
to hold the paradox in place.

269
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:22,400
Allowing the past and the future
to collide in infinite majesty.

270
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:25,400
But you're changing history.

271
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:30,120
Not just Earth. The entire universe.

272
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:32,000
I'm a Time Lord.

273
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:34,440
I have that right.

274
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,840
But even then.

275
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:39,720
Why come all this way
just to destroy?

276
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:44,320
We've come backwards in time
all to build a brand-new empire!

277
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:47,120
Lasting one hundred trillion years!

278
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:48,800
With me as their Master.

279
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:55,640
Time Lord and humans combined.
Haven't you always dreamt of that,
Doctor?

280
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:59,840
What about us? We're the same
species. Why d'you kill us?

281
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:01,400
Because it's fun.

282
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:02,920
SPHERE LAUGHS

283
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,760
Human race -

284
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:11,960
greatest monsters of them all.

285
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:19,720
Night, then.

286
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:36,640
It's time we had the truth,
Miss Jones.

287
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:43,600
Legend says you travelled the world,
to find a way of killing the Master.
Tell us. Is it true?

288
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:48,440
Just before I escaped.
The Doctor told me...

289
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:58,400
The Doctor and the Master, they've
been coming to Earth for years. And
they've been watched.

290
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:03,040
There's UNIT, and Torchwood,
all studying Time Lords in secret.

291
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:05,560
They made this. The ultimate defence.

292
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:08,040
I can shoot the Master with this.

293
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:10,160
You can put that down now.

294
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:14,360
It's not easy to kill a Time Lord,
they can regenerate.

295
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:21,600
Literally bring themselves back
to life. Ah, The Master's immortal!
Wonderful(!) Except for this!

296
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:24,440
Four chemicals in the gun, inject
him...

297
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:27,320
Kills a Time Lord, permanently.

298
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:30,320
Four chemicals? You've only got
three.

299
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:34,480
Still need the last one, the
components were kept safe, scattered
across the world.

300
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:38,560
And I found them. San Diego,
Beijing, Budapest...and London.

301
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:39,440
Then where is it?!

302
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:44,080
An old UNIT base, north London, I've
found the access codes. Get me there.

303
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:48,320
We can't get across London at night,
it's full of wild dogs.

304
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:52,400
Tomorrow we can go with the medical
convoy. You can stay here.

305
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:57,920
We can get halfway, stay at the
slave quarters in Bexley. Professor,
thank you. And you.

306
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:00,680
Good luck. Thanks.

307
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,520
Martha.

308
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:11,840
Could you do it? Could you actually
kill him?

309
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:16,360
Got no choice. You're many things.
But you don't look like a killer.

310
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:40,080
Let me in, it's Milligan.

311
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:44,880
D'you bring food?
Couldn't get any. And I'm starving.

312
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:46,640
All we've got is water.

313
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:47,120
Sorry...

314
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:54,160
It's cheap. Pack them in, hundred in
each house, ferry them off to the
shipyards every morning.

315
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:56,000
Are you Martha Jones?
Yeah, that's me.

316
00:24:56,040 --> 00:25:00,120
Can you kill him? They said you can
kill the Master, can you?

317
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:02,400
Tell us you can do it, please.

318
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:04,680
THEY SPEAK OVER EACH OTHER

319
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:07,960
Come on, leave her alone...
she's exhausted.

320
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,840
No, it's all right.

321
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:12,400
They want me to talk. And I will.

322
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,240
Access Priority One.

323
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:26,880
This is Professor Alison Docherty.
'State your intent.' First of
all, I need to know about my son.

324
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:31,480
'State your intent.'
Is my son still alive?

325
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:34,000
'State your intent.'

326
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:40,120
I have some information
for the Master.

327
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:45,200
Concerning Martha Jones.

328
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:55,600
Guess what?!

329
00:25:55,640 --> 00:26:00,400
I travelled from the ruins of New
York, to the Fusion Mills of China,

330
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:03,480
right across
the Radiation Pits of Europe.

331
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:07,400
Everywhere I saw people like you,
living as slaves.

332
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:12,680
If Martha Jones became a legend,
that's wrong, because I'm not
important.

333
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:14,640
There's someone else.

334
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:19,120
The man who sent me. The man
who told me to walk the Earth.

335
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:27,120
And his name...is the Doctor.

336
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:33,000
He never stops, he never stays,
he never asks to be thanked.

337
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:36,360
But I've seen him. I know him.

338
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:40,320
I love him.

339
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:44,760
And I know what he can do.

340
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:48,560
It's him! Oh, my God, it's him!
The Master! He's here!

341
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:52,720
But he never comes to Earth! He
never walks on the ground! Hide her!

342
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:10,080
He walks among us,
our lord and master. Martha?

343
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:12,560
Martha Jo-hones?

344
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:15,000
I can see-ee-ee you.

345
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:18,800
Out you come, little girl.
Come and meet your Master.

346
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,960
Anybody? Nobody? No? Nothing?

347
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:29,880
Positions!

348
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:34,600
I'll give the order.

349
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,160
Unless you surrender.

350
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:37,920
Ask yourself.

351
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:40,560
What would the Doctor do?

352
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:10,800
Oh, yes!

353
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:12,360
Oh, very well done!

354
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:14,720
Good girl! He trained you well!

355
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:19,920
Bag! Give me the bag!

356
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:24,000
No, stay there, just throw it!

357
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:37,000
And now, good companion...

358
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:38,960
your work is done.

359
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,120
No!

360
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:52,440
But you...when you die,

361
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,800
the Doctor should be witness. Hmmm?

362
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:01,280
Almost dawn, Martha,

363
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:04,840
and Planet Earth

364
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:06,880
marches to war.

365
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:08,840
'Citizens of earth,

366
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,760
'rejoice and observe.'

367
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,440
Your teleport device.
In case you thought I'd forgotten.

368
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,320
And now.

369
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:50,600
Kneel.

370
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:53,520
Down below,
the fleet is ready to launch.

371
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:59,400
200, 000 ships,
set to burn across the universe.

372
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:03,840
Are we ready?

373
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:08,120
'The fleet awaits your signal.
Rejoice!'

374
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:13,400
Three minutes to align the Black
Hole Convertors! Counting down!

375
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:15,560
TICKING

376
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:20,160
I never could resist a ticking
clock! My children! Are you ready?

377
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:25,840
SPHERES: We will fly and blaze
and slice! We will fly and blaze
and slice!

378
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:32,000
At zero, to mark this day,
the child, Martha Jones, will die.

379
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:34,320
My first blood.

380
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:36,640
Any last words?

381
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:38,000
No?

382
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:43,880
Such a disappointment, this one.
Days of old, Doctor,

383
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:49,400
you had companions who could absorb
the Time Vortex! This one's useless!

384
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:51,800
Bow your head.

385
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:59,040
And so it falls to me, as Master of
all, to establish, from this day,
a new order of Time Lords.

386
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:00,400
From this day forward...

387
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:02,640
SHE LAUGHS

388
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:05,480
What...What's so funny?

389
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:10,440
A gun?
What about it? A gun, in four parts?

390
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:13,080
Yes, and I destroyed it.

391
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:16,720
A gun, in four parts, scattered
across the world... I mean!

392
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:19,280
Did you really believe that?! What
d'you mean?

393
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:22,160
As if I would ask her to kill.

394
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:26,600
Oh Well! It does not matter, I have her
exactly where I want her.

395
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:29,360
But I knew what Professor Doherty would do.

396
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:32,240
The resistance, knew.....
About her Son.

397
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:34,880
That's why I came to you.
Know your enemy.

398
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:42,120
I told her about the gun so she'd get
me here. At the right time. You're
still gonna die.

399
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:44,440
Don't you want to know what I was
doing?

400
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:47,640
Tell me. I told a story. That's all.

401
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:49,560
No weapons, just words.

402
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:53,440
I did what the Doctor said. I went
across the continents.

403
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:58,200
And everywhere I went, I found the
people. And I told them my story.

404
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:02,880
He saved your lives so many times
and you never knew he was there.

405
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:06,480
I know him. 'I told them about the
Doctor.' I love him.

406
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:11,720
I told them to pass it on. So
everyone would know about the Doctor.

407
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:13,760
Faith and hope? Is that all?

408
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:17,440
No, I gave them an instruction.
As the Doctor said.

409
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:22,720
'Use the countdown.'
I told them if everyone thinks
of one word at one time...

410
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:24,720
Nothing will happen!

411
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:26,720
Is that your weapon?

412
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:28,960
Prayer?! Right across the world.

413
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:32,600
One word, just one thought,
at one moment...

414
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:35,920
But with 15 satellites.

415
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:37,360
What? The Archangel Network!

416
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:40,480
A telepathic field binding the
human race together,

417
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:43,920
with all of them, every single person
on Earth, thinking the same thing at
the same time.

418
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:45,800
And that word... is "Doctor".

419
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:58,680
Stop it. No, no, no, no, you
don't...

420
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:03,240
Doctor. Doctor.

421
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:05,200
Doc...?

422
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:07,080
Doctor.

423
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:08,880
THEY CHANT

424
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:10,400
Stop this right now! Stop it!

425
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:13,120
Doctor.

426
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:14,920
Doctor. Doctor.

427
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,080
MASSES CHANT: Doctor!

428
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:23,760
I've had a year to tune into the
psychic network and integrate
with its matrices.

429
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:29,200
Doctor. Doctor. Doctor.

430
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:30,240
Doctor.

431
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:38,960
The one thing you can't do.
Stop them thinking.

432
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:46,000
Tell me the human race is degenerate
now,

433
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:47,600
when they can do this.

434
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:56,880
No!

435
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:59,800
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

436
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:03,400
Then I'll kill THEM!

437
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:04,320
You can't do this!

438
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:13,120
You can't do this! It's not fair!

439
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:17,880
And you know what happens now.
No!

440
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:21,680
No! No...

441
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:25,880
No! No!

442
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:31,240
You wouldn't listen. No! Because
you know what I'm going to say...

443
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:41,920
I forgive you.

444
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:44,440
My children!

445
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:48,160
Protect the Paradox!
Protect the Paradox!

446
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:50,520
Protect the Paradox!

447
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:55,960
Captain! The Paradox Machine!
You men! With me! You stay here.

448
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:58,400
No!

449
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:06,680
Now it ends, Doctor!

450
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:09,040
Now it ends!

451
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:11,000
SIRENS

452
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:19,120
We've six billion Spheres
heading for us!

453
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:23,680
We've got control of the Valiant,
you can't launch. I've got this.

454
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:30,520
Black Hole Convertor inside every
ship. If I can't have this world,
then neither can you.

455
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:35,000
We shall stand upon this Earth
together as it burns!

456
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:52,240
Can't get in. We'd get slaughtered.

457
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:54,120
Yeah. Happens to me a lot.

458
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:04,880
Weapon after weapon after weapon,

459
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:11,360
all you do is talk and talk
and talk, but over all these years

460
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:16,880
and all these disasters, I've always
had the greatest secret of them all.

461
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:19,560
I know you.

462
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:23,080
Explode those ships,
you kill yourself.

463
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:26,560
That's the one thing
you can never do.

464
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:30,400
Give that to me.

465
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:05,480
Everyone! Get down!

466
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:07,880
Time is reversing.

467
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:10,920
The paradox is broken.

468
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:15,800
We've reverted back, one year and
one day, 8.02am.

469
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:21,320
'This is UNIT Central, what's
happened? We saw the President
assassinated!'

470
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:24,760
After the President was killed,
before the Spheres.

471
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,480
Planet Earth restored.

472
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:29,800
It never happened. The rockets, the
terror. It never was.

473
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:33,080
What about the Spheres? Trapped at
the end of the universe.

474
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:34,880
But I can remember it.

475
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:39,080
We're at the eye of the storm. The
only ones who'll ever know.

476
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:42,880
Oh, hello! You must be Mr
Jones, we haven't actually met.

477
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:47,000
Whoa, big fella.
You don't want to miss the party.

478
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:48,840
Cuffs.

479
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:54,560
So, what do we do with this one?

480
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:56,520
We kill him. We execute him.

481
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:58,440
No, that's not the solution.

482
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:04,760
Oh, I think so.

483
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:07,960
Cos all those things.

484
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:11,160
They still happened.

485
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:16,200
Because of him. I saw them.

486
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:20,040
Go on! Do it!

487
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:27,560
You're better than him.

488
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:38,240
You still haven't answered the
question. What happens to me?

489
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:43,400
You're my responsibility, from now
on. The only Time Lord
left in existence.

490
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:48,480
Yeah, but you can't trust him. No.
The only safe place
for him is the TARDIS.

491
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:51,520
You mean you're just
gonna...keep me?

492
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:54,560
Mm. If that's what I have to do...

493
00:39:57,480 --> 00:40:02,240
It's time to change. Maybe
I've been wandering for too long.

494
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:05,760
Now, I've got someone to care for.

495
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:20,600
Put it down. There you go...
I've got you, I've got you...

496
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:24,640
Always, the women. I didn't see her.

497
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:28,240
Dying in your arms. Happy now?

498
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:30,720
You're not dying. Don't be stupid.
It's only a bullet. Just regenerate.

499
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:35,320
No. One little bullet, come on.
I guess you don't know me so well.
I refuse.

500
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:39,920
Regenerate, just regenerate, please,
please just regenerate, come on...

501
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:44,600
And spend the rest of my life
imprisoned with you?

502
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:49,080
But you've got to! Come on!

503
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:51,160
It can't end like this!

504
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:52,800
You and me!
All the things we've done.

505
00:40:54,320 --> 00:41:00,040
Axons! Remember the Axons, and the
Daleks... We're the only two left.

506
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:05,640
And no-one else.

507
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:07,720
Regenerate!

508
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:13,640
How about that? I win.

509
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:22,520
Will it stop, Doctor?

510
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:26,320
The drumming? Will it stop?

511
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:54,080
NO-O-O-O!

512
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:10,080
Just to say... I don't blame you.
But who are you?

513
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:24,080
Time was, every single one of
these people knew your name.

514
00:43:24,120 --> 00:43:27,960
Now they've all forgotten you. Good.

515
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:31,520
Back to work.
I really don't mind, though.

516
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:35,560
Come with me. Had plenty of
time to think, that past year.

517
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:38,560
The year that never was.

518
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:41,800
And I kept thinking
about that team of mine.

519
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:45,240
Like you said, Doctor.

520
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:48,200
Responsibility. Defending the Earth.

521
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:50,120
Can't argue with that.

522
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:52,880
Hey, I need that!

523
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:58,320
I can't have you walking round
with a time-travelling teleport,
you could go anywhere. Twice.

524
00:43:58,360 --> 00:44:00,200
Second time to apologise.

525
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:03,000
And what about me? Can you fix that?
Will I ever be able to die?

526
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:05,240
Nothing I can do.

527
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:08,200
You're an impossible thing, Jack.

528
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:10,800
Been called that before.

529
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:15,880
Sir.

530
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:18,480
Ma'am.

531
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:24,800
But I keep wondering,
what about ageing?

532
00:44:24,840 --> 00:44:30,880
Cos I can't die,
but I keep getting older,
the odd little grey hair, y'know?

533
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:35,360
What happens if I live for a
million years? I really don't know.

534
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:37,040
OK, vanity, sorry, yeah.

535
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:40,960
Can't help it.
Used to be a poster boy!

536
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:44,840
When I was a kid,
living in the Boeshane Peninsula,

537
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:46,640
tiny little place,

538
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:50,040
I was the first one ever to be
signed up for the Time Agency.

539
00:44:50,080 --> 00:44:53,440
They were so proud of me.
The Face of Boe, they called me.

540
00:44:53,480 --> 00:44:55,200
Hmm!

541
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:57,000
I'll see you.

542
00:45:01,720 --> 00:45:04,400
No. Can't be.

543
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:08,320
No. Definitely not. No.

544
00:45:10,120 --> 00:45:13,160
No!

545
00:45:59,720 --> 00:46:02,240
Yeah, could you put me through?

546
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:10,280
Hi, I'm looking for
a Dr Thomas Milligan.

547
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:14,000
Yeah? Hello?

548
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:16,720
Hello?

549
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:31,880
Right then! Off we go.

550
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:35,000
The open road! There is a burst of
starfire, right now, over the coast

551
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:40,200
of Meta Sigmafolio, the sky is like
oil on water, fancy a look?

552
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:42,760
Or...back in time, we could...

553
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:44,360
I don't know, Charles II?

554
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:46,840
Henry VIII?
I know, what about Agatha Christie?!

555
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:50,480
I'd love to meet Agatha
Christie, bet she's brilliant!

556
00:46:56,680 --> 00:47:03,200
OK. I just can't. Yeah. Spent all
these years training to be a doctor.

557
00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:08,360
Now I've got people to look after.
They saw half the planet slaughtered,
and they're devastated.

558
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:10,920
I can't leave them. Course not.

559
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:27,360
Thank you.

560
00:47:32,040 --> 00:47:33,760
Martha Jones, you saved the world.

561
00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:35,560
Yes, I did!

562
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:42,680
I spent a lot of time with you,
thinking I was second best.
But d'you know what? I am good!

563
00:47:45,640 --> 00:47:48,600
You going to be all right?
Always, yeah.

564
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:51,240
Right, then. Bye.

565
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:13,560
Cos the thing is, it's like my
friend Vicky, she lived with
this bloke, student housing,

566
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:15,520
there were five of them, all packed
in, and this bloke was called Shaun,

567
00:48:15,560 --> 00:48:22,120
and she loved him, she did,
she completely adored him, spent
all day long talking about him.

568
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:24,920
Is this going anywhere? Yes!

569
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:26,960
Cos he never looked at her twice.

570
00:48:29,320 --> 00:48:32,480
I mean, he liked her, that was it!

571
00:48:34,040 --> 00:48:36,720
And she wasted years pining
after him, years of her life,

572
00:48:36,760 --> 00:48:39,360
cos while he was around, she
never looked at anyone else.

573
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:47,080
And I told her, I always said to her,
time and time again, I said,
"Get out."

574
00:48:51,120 --> 00:48:53,720
So this is me.

575
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:56,360
Getting out.

576
00:49:00,920 --> 00:49:03,280
Keep that.

577
00:49:03,320 --> 00:49:05,560
Cos I'm not having you disappear!

578
00:49:05,600 --> 00:49:09,040
If that rings, WHEN that rings,
you'd better come running, got it?

579
00:49:09,080 --> 00:49:10,840
Got it!

580
00:49:16,080 --> 00:49:18,720
I'll see you again, mister.

581
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:12,480
HORN BLARES

582
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:19,880
What?

583
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:22,400
But... What?!

584
00:50:26,920 --> 00:50:31,080
BELL TOLLS
What?!

585
00:50:31,120 --> 00:50:37,120
