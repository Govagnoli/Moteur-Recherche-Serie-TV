1
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:04,600
Solar flare activity has increased
across space lanes 556

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:06,700
and all commercial flights
are advised. . .

3
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:18,400
THROBBING HUM

4
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:28,400
So, it's 200, 000, it's a
spaceship. . . No, wait a minute,
space STATION.

5
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:29,500
And, er. . .

6
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:31,200
Go try that gate over there!

7
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:35,500
200,000? 200,000.
Adam! Out you come.

8
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:40,000
Oh, my God. . .
Don't worry, you'll get used to it.

9
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:42,600
Where are we? Good question.

10
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:43,900
Let's see.

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,400
So, erm,
judging by the architecture, I'd
say we're around the year 200,000.

12
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:50,900
THROBBING
And if you listen. . .

13
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:52,200
Engines.

14
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:54,300
We're on some sort of space station.

15
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:56,800
Yeah, definitely a space station.

16
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:59,900
It's a bit warm in here,
they could turn the heating down.

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,600
Tell you what, let's try that gate.
Come on.

18
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:10,700
Here we go.

19
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:13,500
And this is. . .

20
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:20,000
I'll let the Doctor describe it.

21
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:23,700
The Fourth Great and Bountiful
Human Empire. And there it is.

22
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:25,900
Planet Earth, at its height.

23
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:30,700
Covered with mega-cities, five
moons, population 96 billion,

24
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:35,000
the hub of a galactic domain
stretching across a million planets,

25
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
a million species,
with mankind right in the middle.

26
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:43,500
He's your boyfriend.

27
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:45,400
Not any more.

28
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:28,900
Come on, Adam, open your mind.
You'll like this.

29
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,500
Fantastic period of history, the
human race at its most intelligent.

30
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:34,000
Culture! Art! Politics!

31
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,600
This era has got fine food, good
manners, the works. . . Out the way!

32
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,400
Somebody there? What do you
want, love? Keep it moving.

33
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:46,900
I'll be with you lot in a minute.
One at a time!

34
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Now what was it? Kronkburger with
cheese, kronkburger with pajatos.

35
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,600
Oi! You, mate! stop pushing.

36
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:58,600
Get back! I said back!

37
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:02,000
Fine cuisine?
My watch must be wrong.

38
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:04,500
No, it's fine. That's weird.

39
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:07,200
That's showing off.
Your history's not that good.

40
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,200
My history is perfect.
Obviously not.

41
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:13,500
They're all human. What about the
millions of planets, the millions
of species?

42
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:16,000
Good question.
That IS a good question.

43
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,500
Adam, me old mate,
you must be starving!

44
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:20,100
No, I'm just a bit timesick.

45
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,700
You just need grub.
How much is a kronkburger?

46
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,600
Two credits twenty, sweetheart.
Now join the queue!

47
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:27,900
Money! We need money.

48
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,500
Let's use a cashpoint.

49
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:33,400
HIGH-PITCHED TONE

50
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:40,000
There you go, pocket money.
Don't spend it all on sweets.

51
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:41,800
Well, how does it work?

52
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,800
Go and find out, stop nagging me!

53
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:47,000
The thing is, Adam,
time travel's like visiting Paris.

54
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
You can't just read the guidebook.

55
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,100
You've got to eat the food,
get charged double and
kiss complete strangers.

56
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,400
Or is that just me?

57
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,500
Stop asking questions, go and do it!

58
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:00,300
Off you go then. Your first date.

59
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:02,100
You're gonna get a smack, you are!

60
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:09,900
Erm, this is gonna sound daft,
but can you tell me where I am?

61
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:11,400
Floor 139.

62
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:14,900
Could they write it any bigger?
Floor 139 of what?

63
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:19,300
Must've been a hell of a party.
You're on Satellite Five.
And what's Satellite Five?

64
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:22,900
How could you get on board
without knowing where you are?
I'm stupid!

65
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:25,100
Hold on, wait a minute. . .
Are you a test?

66
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:28,400
Some sort of management test
kind of thing? You've got me!

67
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,400
Well done! You're too clever for me.

68
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,800
We were warned about this
in basic training.

69
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:37,900
All workers have to be versed
in company promotion.

70
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:40,000
Right, fire away,
ask your questions.

71
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:42,400
If it gets me to Floor
500, I'll do anything.

72
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,000
What happens on Floor 500?

73
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,100
The walls are made of gold!

74
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:50,300
And you should know, Mr Management.

75
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:53,000
So. . .this is what we do.

76
00:04:55,400 --> 00:05:00,300
Latest news! Sandstorms on the
New Venus Archipelago, 200 dead.

77
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,700
Glasgow water riots
into their third day.

78
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:06,300
Spacelane 77 closed
by sunspot activity.

79
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:10,500
Over on the Bad Wolf channel,
The Face of Boe has just
announced he's pregnant.

80
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,500
I get it. You broadcast the news.

81
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:14,000
We ARE the news.

82
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,700
We're the journalists.

83
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:18,700
We write it, package it and sell it.

84
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:22,700
600 channels,
all coming out of Satellite Five,
broadcasting everywhere.

85
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,300
Something. . .

86
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:30,600
is wrong.

87
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,500
Something fictional.

88
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,600
Those people.

89
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:41,800
Nothing happens in the Empire
without it going through us.

90
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:44,300
Security check.

91
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,900
Go deep.

92
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:52,800
'Staff are reminded that the canteen
area now operates a self-cleaning
table system. Thank you.'

93
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:57,000
Try this, it's called zaffic.
It's nice, like, erm, a Slush Puppy.

94
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:58,500
What flavour?

95
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:02,600
It's sort of beef.

96
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,300
Oh, my God!

97
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,200
It's like everything's gone.

98
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:11,200
Home, family. . .

99
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,800
Everything.

100
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:16,900
This  helps. The Doctor
gave it a bit of a top-up.

101
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,600
Who's back home, your mum and dad?

102
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:19,700
Yeah.

103
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:21,500
Phone 'em up.

104
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,600
But that's 198, 000 years ago.

105
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:27,500
Honestly, try it. Go on.

106
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,900
Is there a code for planet Earth?
Just dial!

107
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:34,600
TELEPHONE RINGS

108
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:40,900
'I'm sorry, we're not in.
Please leave a message. Thanks, bye!'

109
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:43,700
Erm. . .hi!

110
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:45,700
It.  . .it's me.

111
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:50,100
'I've sort of gone travelling.

112
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:54,900
'I met these people
and we're travelling together'

113
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:58,300
but, erm, I'm fine.
And I'll call you later.

114
00:06:58,300 --> 00:06:59,800
Love you. Bye.

115
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:05,100
KLAXON SOUNDS

116
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:08,300
Oi, Mutt and Jeff! Over 'ere!

117
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:23,300
'Security check cleared.'
No, something's wrong!

118
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:25,000
I can taste it.

119
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:29,400
A tiny little shift
in the information.

120
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:33,000
Someone down there
shouldn't be here.

121
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,900
Double check.

122
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:36,600
Triple check.

123
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,300
Follow them.

124
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:45,400
Now everybody behave,
we have a management inspection.
How d'you want it, by the book?

125
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:47,200
Right from scratch, thanks.

126
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:51,800
OK. So! Ladies, gentlemen,
multisex, undecided or robot,

127
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:54,800
my name is Cathica Santini Khadeni.

128
00:07:54,800 --> 00:08:00,100
That's Cathica with a C,
in case you want to write to Floor
500, praising me. And please do.

129
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:02,600
Now, please feel free
to ask any questions.

130
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:06,900
The process of news gathering must
be open, honest and beyond bias.

131
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:09,000
That's company policy.

132
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,600
Actually, erm, it's the law.

133
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:15,000
Yes, thank you, Suki.

134
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,500
OK, keep it calm.

135
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:19,000
Don't show off for the guests.

136
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,400
Here we go.

137
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:23,600
And. . .

138
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,600
engage safety.

139
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:28,300
HUMMING

140
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:44,400
And three. . .

141
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:47,400
two. . .and spike!

142
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,300
Compressed information.

143
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,900
Streaming into her!

144
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,400
Reports from every city,
every country, every planet,

145
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,800
and they all get packaged
inside her head.

146
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,900
She becomes part of the software.

147
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:05,200
Her brain IS the computer!

148
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,700
If it all goes through her,
she must be a genius.

149
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:12,500
Nah, she wouldn't remember any of it.
There's too much. Her head'd blow up!

150
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,400
The brain's the processor.

151
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:16,800
Soon as it closes, she forgets.

152
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:19,000
What about these people
round the edge?

153
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:24,100
They've all got tiny little chips in
their head, connecting them to her.
And they transmit.

154
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:28,500
600 channels. Every single fact in
the Empire beams out of this place.

155
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:33,300
Now that's what I call power.

156
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:37,100
'Analysis confirmed.
Security breach.'

157
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:40,100
I knew it! Which one?

158
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:42,700
It's someone inside
that room, which one?

159
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:47,600
'Isolating breach.'

160
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:50,200
Come on. Show me! Who is it?

161
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:55,800
You all right? I can see her brain.

162
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:58,600
D'you wanna get out? No, but this. . .

163
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:00,700
this technology, it's. . . amazing.

164
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:03,800
This technology's wrong.

165
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:07,400
Trouble?

166
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:08,900
Oh, yeah.

167
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:12,100
BEEPING

168
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:14,900
That's it! Ho, ho, ho, yes!

169
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:18,900
She's the liar! Intercept and scan.

170
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:20,400
Gotcha!

171
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:30,500
Come off it, Suki, I wasn't
even halfway! What was that for?

172
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:33,000
Sorry. It must've been a glitch.

173
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:36,400
Her information's
been tampered with.

174
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:39,300
There's a second biography
hidden underneath.

175
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:42,800
Grrr! Yes, sir. Absolutely, sir.

176
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:47,500
Yeah, her data was encrypted,
so there's no way we
could've found her sooner.

177
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:50,900
Grrr!
Yeah, sorry, I. . .yeah, sorry, sir.

178
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:53,000
GRRR!
Yeah, absolutely.

179
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,600
Get her up here! Now!

180
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:58,300
Promotion.

181
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:01,500
Come on, this is it, come on!

182
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,100
Oh, my God, make it me!

183
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:07,500
Come on, say my name,
say my name, say my name!

184
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:09,800
Promotion for. . .

185
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:14,200
Suki Macrae Cantrell.
Please proceed to floor 500.

186
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:18,200
I don't believe it! Floor 500!

187
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,700
How the hell did you manage that?
I'm above you!

188
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:24,500
I don't know,
I just applied on the off chance.

189
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,300
And they've said yes!

190
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:30,900
Oh, it's so not fair,
I've been applying to
Floor 500 for three years!

191
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,800
What's Floor 500?

192
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:35,800
The walls are made of gold.

193
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,700
Cathica, I'm gonna miss you.

194
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:42,900
Floor 500! Thank you!
I didn't do anything!

195
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:44,200
You're my lucky charm!

196
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:46,900
All right, I'll hug anyone!

197
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,800
Come on, it's not that bad.

198
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:52,300
What? With the. . .the head-thing? !

199
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:54,000
Yeah, well, she's closed it now.

200
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,500
Yeah,  but. . .

201
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:59,900
It's everything.
It freaks me out.

202
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:01,800
And I just need to. . .

203
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,400
ah, if I could just. . .

204
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:07,200
cool down. Sort of acclimatise.

205
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:09,500
How d'you mean?

206
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:14,300
Maybe I could just go and sit
on the observation deck.
Would that be all right?

207
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:19,100
Soak it in, y'know. Pretend I'm
a citizen of the year 200, 000.

208
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:21,200
D'you want me to come with ya?

209
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,800
No, no, you stick with the Doctor.

210
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,800
You'd rather be with him.

211
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:34,200
It's gonna take a better man
than me to get between you two.

212
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:36,900
Anyway. . .

213
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:38,500
I'll be on the deck.

214
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:41,000
Here you go, take the Tardis key.

215
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:43,300
Just in case
it gets a bit too much.

216
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:46,000
Yeah, like it's not weird in there.

217
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,300
Oh my God, I've got to go!
I can't keep them waiting.
I'm sorry!

218
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:03,800
Say goodbye to Steve for me.

219
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:06,000
Bye!

220
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,800
Good riddance!

221
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,600
You're talking like you'll
never see her again.

222
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:15,700
We won't. Once you go to Floor 500,
you never come back.

223
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:28,700
Have you ever been up there? Can't.

224
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:32,000
You need a key for the lift, and
you only get a key with promotion.

225
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,900
No-one gets to 500,
except for the chosen few.

226
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,400
SHE SCREAMS

227
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,500
Who are you?

228
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:18,400
I'm the Editor.

229
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:21,800
What's happening?

230
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:25,400
There are bodies out there.
What's going on?

231
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:29,400
While we're asking questions,
would you please confirm your name?

232
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:37,400
'My name is Suki Macrae Cantrell.
I was born 199 apostrophe 89 in the
Independent Republic of Morocco.'

233
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:38,500
Liar!

234
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:42,300
'Hobbies include reading
and archaeology.

235
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:45,800
'I'm not an expert or anything,
I just like digging.' Liar!

236
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:50,800
'I want to work for Satellite Five
because my sister can't afford
university,

237
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:53,100
'and the pay-scheme
is really good. . .'

238
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:54,000
LIAR!

239
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:58,400
Let's look at the facts, shall we?

240
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:01,400
Hidden behind a genetic graft,
but that's still you.

241
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:06,800
Eva Saint Julienne, last surviving
member of the Freedom Fifteen.

242
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:09,600
Mmm, self-declared anarchist,
is that right?

243
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:11,800
Who controls Satellite Five?

244
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:21,800
There's the truth!

245
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:27,100
The Freedom Foundation has been
monitoring Satellite Five's
transmissions.

246
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:30,700
We have absolute proof that
the facts are being manipulated.

247
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:33,200
YOU are lying to the people!

248
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:34,800
Oooh, I love it! Say it again!

249
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,400
This whole system is corrupt.

250
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,100
Who do you represent?

251
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:43,000
I'm merely a humble slave.

252
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,500
I answer to the Editor In Chief.

253
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:49,300
Who is he, where is he?
He's overseeing everything.

254
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:51,600
Literally everything.

255
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:56,100
If you don't mind, I'm gonna
have to refer this upwards.

256
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:58,500
Grrr!

257
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:03,300
What is that? Your boss.

258
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:05,600
This has always been your boss.

259
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,500
Since the day you were born.

260
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:29,200
Give me access.

261
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:35,800
Give me. . .

262
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:40,900
I can learn anything.

263
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:49,900
Let's try, erm, computers.

264
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:55,500
From the 21st century to the
present day, give me the history
of the microprocessor.

265
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:00,900
Oh my God.

266
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:04,600
They only give us
twenty minutes maintenance,
can't you give it a rest?

267
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:08,100
But you've never been to another
floor? Not even one floor down?

268
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:12,500
I went to Floor 16 when I first
arrived, that's Medical, that's
where I got my head done

269
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:14,400
and then I. . .I came straight here.

270
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:18,000
Satellite Five. You work,
eat and sleep on the same floor,
that's it.

271
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,900
You're not management, are you?

272
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:22,800
At last, she's clever!

273
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:26,000
Whatever it is, don't involve me.
I don't know anything.

274
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,200
Don't you even ask?
Why would I? You're a journalist!

275
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,900
Why's all the crew human?

276
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
What's that got to do with anything?

277
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,100
There's no aliens on board. Why?

278
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:38,200
I dunno, no real reason.

279
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:40,800
They're not banned.
Then where are they?

280
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:45,800
Immigration's tightened up. . .
It's had to, with all the threats.

281
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:46,900
What threats?

282
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:50,700
I dunno, all of them. Usual stuff.

283
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:54,100
The price of spacewarp doubled,
so that kept the visitors away.

284
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:59,400
Oh, and the government on
Chavic Fice collapsed, so that
lot stopped coming, y'see?

285
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:01,300
Lots of little reasons, that's all.

286
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:04,600
Adding up to one great big fact.
And you didn't even notice.

287
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:09,100
Doctor, I think if there was any
sort of conspiracy, Satellite
Five would have seen it.

288
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:11,300
We see everything. I can see better.

289
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:15,300
This society's the wrong shape, even
the technology. It's cutting edge!

290
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:16,700
There's a door in your head!

291
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:19,900
Should've chucked this out years ago!
What's going on?

292
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:23,300
It's not just this space station,
it's the way people think.

293
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:27,000
The Great and Bountiful
Human Empire, something's
holding it back.

294
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:28,900
And how would you know?

295
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:31,700
Humanity's been
set back about 90 years.

296
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:35,200
When did Satellite Five
start broadcasting?

297
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:37,100
91 years ago.

298
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:44,400
Mum, Dad, keep this message, OK?

299
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:47,100
Whatever you do, don't erase it.

300
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:50,100
Save  it, you got that?

301
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:57,900
The microprocessor became redundant
in the year 2019,

302
00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:03,500
replaced by a system called SMT -
that's Single Molecule
Transcription.

303
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:05,800
No, no, no, no, no!
What are you doing?

304
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:09,500
Come back, come. . .
Why are you doing that?

305
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:15,200
What's Floor 16? What's down there?

306
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,700
Sorry, erm. . .

307
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:45,100
Floor 16, that's, erm. . .
What do you cover?

308
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,000
Medical non-emergency.

309
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:52,400
Right! Wrong floor. I'm having
technical difficulties, my screen
keeps freezing, locking me out.

310
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:56,900
No, that's medical. There must
be something wrong with your chip.

311
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,600
Yes! Yeah, of course, yeah!

312
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:02,800
I haven't got one.

313
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:05,000
No wonder you can't
get a screen to work.

314
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:08,800
What are you, a. . .student?

315
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:12,500
Yes. Yeah, I'm, erm. . .

316
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:15,100
I'm on a research project. . .

317
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:17,600
from the University of Mars.

318
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:22,000
The Martian boondocks, typical. Yep!

319
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:24,600
Well, you still need chipping.

320
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:27,600
So, does that mean, like. . .

321
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:32,500
brain surgery?
That's an old-fashioned phrase,
but it's the same thing, yes.

322
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:34,900
Oh! OK. Never mind.

323
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,700
But if I get a chip,

324
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:41,100
that means I could use any computer?

325
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:43,500
Absolutely.

326
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:45,900
You'll have to pay for it.

327
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:47,800
They've stopped subsidising.

328
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:51,000
Oh, right, sorry. Wasting your time.

329
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,500
Thanks.

330
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:57,600
Hold on!

331
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,900
Can I use this?

332
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,400
That'll do nicely.

333
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:05,100
It all comes down
to two basic types.

334
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:11,900
Type one, the head-chip,
inserted into the back of the skull,
one hundred credits.

335
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:13,500
There's the chip.

336
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:17,300
Tiny, invisible, no scarring.

337
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:20,700
Type two is the full info-spike.

338
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:22,400
Oh, erm, that's the. . .

339
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:26,000
. .thing. That's the one.

340
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:28,400
It does cost 10, 000.

341
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:31,700
Oh, well I, erm,
I couldn't afford it then.

342
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:36,600
Not at all. Turns out
you've got unlimited credit.

343
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:41,900
No, but I. . .well,
I couldn't have it done.

344
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:45,200
I mean. . .that's gotta hurt,
hasn't it?

345
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:48,400
Painless. Contractual guarantee.

346
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:53,000
No, my. . .my mate's waiting upstairs,
I can't have major surgery.

347
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:55,300
It takes ten minutes.

348
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:59,600
That sort of money buys
a very fast picosurgeon.

349
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:02,000
No, but I. . .

350
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:03,600
I couldn't though, no.

351
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:10,600
Type one, you can interface
with a simple computer.

352
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:15,500
Type two, you ARE the computer.

353
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:20,600
You can transmit any piece of
information from the archive
of Satellite Five,

354
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:24,100
which is just about the entire
history of the human race.

355
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,100
Now. . .

356
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
. .which one's it going to be?

357
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,800
We're so gonna get in trouble.

358
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:41,700
You're not allowed to touch
the mainframe, we'll get told off.

359
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:46,300
Rose, tell her to button it.
You can't vandalise the place,
someone's gonna notice!

360
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:48,900
I don't understand!

361
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:54,900
We did a full security scan.
That man was there when we
found Suki Macrae Cantrell.

362
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:57,600
There were no
indications about him.

363
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:00,500
And yet here he is.

364
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:03,000
Clearly acting
outside the parameters.

365
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:06,600
Fascinating!

366
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:09,200
Grrr!

367
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:10,800
Yes, sir!

368
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:14,900
Absolutely!

369
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:16,400
At once!

370
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,800
Check him.

371
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:21,100
Double check him,
triple check him, quadruple!

372
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:26,700
This is nothing to do with me,
I'm going back to work.

373
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:29,600
Go on then, see ya!
I can't just leave you, can I?

374
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:33,800
If you want to be useful,
get them to turn the heating down,
it's boiling.

375
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:35,700
Can't they do something about it?

376
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:38,500
We keep asking.
Something to do with the turbines.

377
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:43,000
"Something to do with the turbines".
I don't know!
Exactly. I give up on you, Cathica.

378
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,800
Now, Rose, look at Rose. 
Rose is asking the right kind of questions.

379
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:48,200
I thank you. 
Why is it so hot?

380
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:52,200
One minute you worry about the Empire,
the next it's the central heating!

381
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:54,800
Oh, never underestimate plumbing.
Plumbing is very important.

382
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,700
'Security scan complete.'

383
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:04,700
Well, who is he? 'He is no-one.'

384
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:07,200
What does THAT mean?

385
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:08,800
'He is no-one.'

386
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:11,400
What, you mean he has a fake ID?

387
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:13,700
'He has no identification.'

388
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:18,000
But everyone's registered. We have
a census for the entire Empire!

389
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,500
'He is no-one.'

390
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:21,400
What, he doesn't exist?

391
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:23,200
Not anywhere? 'He is no-one.'

392
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,700
What about the blonde?

393
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:28,100
'She is no-one.' BOTH of them?!

394
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:33,200
Well, we all know what happens
to non-entities.

395
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,800
They get promoted.

396
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:37,800
Bring them up!

397
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:43,400
Here we go. Satellite Five. Pipes
and plumbing. Look at the layout.

398
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:45,400
This is ridiculous.

399
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:48,200
You've got access to
the computer's core.

400
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:51,700
You could look at the archive,
the news, the stock exchange. . .

401
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:55,300
And you're looking at pipes?
But there's something wrong.

402
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:57,600
I suppose. . . Why, what is it?

403
00:26:57,700 --> 00:27:00,200
The ventilation system.

404
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:03,200
Cooling ducts. Ice filters.
All working flat out.

405
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:06,000
Channelling massive
amounts of heat down.

406
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,300
All the way from the top. Floor 500.

407
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:11,300
Something up there is
generating tons and tons of heat.

408
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:14,300
Don't know about you but I feel
I'm missing out on a party.

409
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:15,900
It's all going on upstairs.

410
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:18,500
Fancy a trip?
You can't, you need a key.

411
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:22,300
Keys are just codes. And I've
got the codes right here. Here we go.

412
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:25,500
Override 215.9.

413
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,300
How come it's giving YOU the code?

414
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:32,100
Someone up there likes me.

415
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:41,800
I told you it was painless.

416
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:44,800
No scarring, you see?

417
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:46,600
Perfect success.

418
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:50,100
How do I. . .activate it?

419
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:52,100
It's a personal choice.

420
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:54,000
Some people whistle.

421
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,800
I know one man who triggers it
with "Oh, Danny Boy".

422
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:01,700
But you're set on default for now.

423
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:04,000
That's a click of the fingers.

424
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:05,700
You mean I just. . . ?

425
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:09,300
Click.

426
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:15,300
Come on, come with us. No way!

427
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:18,300
Bye! Well, don't mention my name.

428
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:21,600
When you get in trouble,
just don't involve me.

429
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:25,300
That's her gone. Adam's given up.
Looks like it's just you and me.

430
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:27,100
Yeah. Good.

431
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:28,600
Yep.

432
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:45,000
Oh, my God! I'm gonna be sick!

433
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,600
HE RETCHES

434
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,600
Special offer.

435
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:58,400
We installed the vomit-o-matic
at the same time.

436
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:01,600
Nano-termites have been placed
in the lining of your throat.

437
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:03,200
In the event of sickness. . .

438
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:06,600
they freeze the waste.

439
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:21,300
The walls are not made of gold.

440
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:23,400
You should go back downstairs.

441
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:24,900
Tough.

442
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:44,700
I started without you.

443
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:46,900
This is fascinating.

444
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:52,800
Satellite Five contains every piece
of information within the Fourth
Great and Bountiful Human Empire.

445
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:57,900
Birth certificates, shopping habits,
bank statements, but you two. . .

446
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,200
You don't exist.

447
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:01,400
There's not a trace.

448
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:04,900
No birth, no job,
not the slightest kiss.

449
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:08,500
How can you walk through the world
and not leave a single footprint?

450
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:10,500
Suki. . .Suki!

451
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:12,400
Hello?

452
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:14,500
Can you hear me? Suki?

453
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:17,400
What have you done to her?
I think she's dead.

454
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:21,800
But she's. . .working.

455
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:25,900
They've all got chips in their head.
And the chips keep going.
Like puppets.

456
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:30,700
Oh! You're full of information,
but it's only fair
we get some information back.

457
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:33,200
Because, apparently, you're no-one.

458
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:35,700
It's so rare, not to know something.

459
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:37,400
Who are you?

460
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:40,200
It doesn't matter, cos we're off.
Nice to meet you.

461
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:41,700
Come on!

462
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:48,300
Tell me who you are! Since that
information's keeping us alive,
I'm hardly gonna say.

463
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:51,700
Well, perhaps my Editor In Chief
can convince you otherwise.

464
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:53,400
And who's that?

465
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:59,600
It may interest you to know
that this is NOT the Fourth Great
and Bountiful Human Empire.

466
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:02,600
In fact,
it's not actually human at all.

467
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:06,800
It's merely a place where
humans happen to live. Grrr!

468
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:08,800
Yep. Yep.

469
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:12,400
Sorry!

470
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:17,600
It's a place where
humans are allowed to live,
by kind permission of my client.

471
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:20,500
Grrr!

472
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:29,500
What is that?

473
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:32,900
You mean that thing's in
charge of Satellite Five?

474
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:37,500
That "thing", as you put it,
is in charge of the human race.

475
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:40,800
For almost 100 years, mankind
has been shaped and guided.

476
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:44,600
His knowledge and ambition, strictly
controlled, by its broadcast news.

477
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:47,600
Edited by my superior, your master,

478
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:50,500
and humanity's guiding light,

479
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:54,100
The Mighty Jagrafess of the
Holy Hadrojassic Maxarodenfoe.

480
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:56,400
I call him Max!

481
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:36,800
Create a climate of fear, and it's
easy to keep the borders closed.

482
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:39,800
It's just a matter of emphasis.

483
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:44,700
The right word in the right
broadcast repeated often enough
can destabilise an economy.

484
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:46,700
Invent an enemy. Change a vote.

485
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:49,600
So all the people on
Earth are like. . .slaves?

486
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:53,200
Well, now,
there's an interesting point.

487
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:57,400
Is a slave a slave if
he doesn't know he's enslaved? Yes.

488
00:32:57,400 --> 00:33:01,400
Oh, I was hoping for a philosophical
debate. Is that all I'm gonna get?

489
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:02,900
"Yes"? Yes.

490
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,600
You're no fun.

491
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:07,800
Let me out of these manacles.
You'll find out how much fun I am.

492
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:09,700
Oh, he's tough, isn't he? !

493
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:12,600
But come on!
Isn't it a great system?

494
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:14,600
You've got to admire it, just a bit.

495
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:18,100
You can't hide something on this
scale, somebody must've noticed.

496
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:20,700
From time to time, someone, yes.

497
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:24,300
But the computer-chip system
allows me to see inside
their brains.

498
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:27,500
I can see the smallest doubt.
And crush it!

499
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:47,400
And then they just carry on, living
the life, strutting about downstairs

500
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:51,100
and all over the surface of the
Earth, like they're SO individual.

501
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:53,900
When, of course, they're not.
They're just cattle.

502
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:57,600
In that respect, the Jagrafess
hasn't changed a thing.

503
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:01,200
But what about you?
You're not a Jagra. . .er. . .belly.

504
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:03,900
Jagrafess.
Jagrafess. You're not a Jagrafess.

505
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:07,500
You're human. Yeah, well, simply
being human doesn't pay very well.

506
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:11,000
But you couldn't have done
this all on your own. No!

507
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:14,100
I represent a consortium of banks.

508
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:16,700
Money prefers
a long-term investment.

509
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:21,200
Also the Jagrafess needed a little
hand, to, erm, install himself.

510
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:24,000
No wonder, creature that size.
What's its lifespan?

511
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:28,100
3,000 years.
That's one hell of a metabolism.
Generating all that heat.

512
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:30,800
That's why Satellite Five's so hot.

513
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:35,600
You pump it out of the creature,
channel it downstairs, Jagrafess
stays cool, stays alive.

514
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:39,400
Satellite Five is one great
big life-support system.

515
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:44,500
HE DIALS

516
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:47,100
'Me again. Don't wipe this message.'

517
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:51,700
It's just gonna sound like
white noise, but save it,
cos I can translate it, OK?

518
00:34:55,200 --> 00:35:00,900
Three, two, one, and spike!

519
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:08,000
But THAT'S why you're so dangerous.

520
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,800
Knowledge is power,
but you remain unknown.

521
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:14,700
ELECTRICAL SURGE
Who are you?

522
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:24,800
Leave her alone! I'm the Doctor.

523
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:27,900
She's Rose Tyler, we're nothing,
we're just wandering.

524
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,100
Tell me who you are! I've just said!

525
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:31,700
Yeah, but who do you work for?

526
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:33,800
Who sent you? Who knows about us?

527
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:34,900
Who exactly. . . ?

528
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:42,200
Time Lord.

529
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:43,400
What?

530
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:47,400
Oh, yes! The last of the Time Lords.

531
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:49,200
And his travelling machine.

532
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:52,000
With his little human girl
from long ago.

533
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:55,700
Don't know what you're talking about.
Time travel!

534
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:58,900
HE SCREAMS

535
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:03,100
Someone's been telling you lies.

536
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:05,800
Young master Adam Mitchell?

537
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:08,300
ADAM SCREAMS

538
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:13,000
Oh, my God, his head. . .

539
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,500
What the hell's he done?

540
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:17,700
What the hell's he gone and done?

541
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:20,700
They're reading his mind,
he's telling them everything.

542
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:23,500
And through HIM,
I know everything about YOU.

543
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:27,200
Every piece of information
in his head is now mine.

544
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:30,500
And YOU have infinite
knowledge, Doctor.

545
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:36,000
The Human Empire is tiny, compared
to what you've seen in your
T, A, R, D, I, S. . .

546
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:39,400
Tardis! Well, you'll never get your
hands on it, I'll die first!

547
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:42,400
Well, die all you like,
I don't need ya! I've got the key!

548
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:53,400
You and your boyfriends!

549
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:56,200
Today, WE are the headlines.

550
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:58,100
We can re-write history.

551
00:36:58,100 --> 00:37:00,500
We could prevent mankind
from developing.

552
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:02,200
And no-one's gonna stop you.

553
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:06,000
Because you've bred a
human race which doesn't
bother to ask questions.

554
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:09,000
Stupid little slaves
believing every lie.

555
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:13,500
They'll just trot
right into the slaughterhouse
if they're told it's made of gold.

556
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:16,000
Grrr!

557
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:30,500
Disengage safety.

558
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:34,100
ALARM SOUNDS

559
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:36,400
What's happening?

560
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:40,500
Maximum access, override Floor 139.

561
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,500
And. . .spike!

562
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:50,900
Someone's disengaged the safety.

563
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,900
Who's that?

564
00:37:57,100 --> 00:37:59,800
It's Cathica. And she's thinking!

565
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:01,600
She's using what she knows.

566
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:03,500
Terminate her access!

567
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:08,200
Everything I told her about Satellite
Five, the pipes, the filters,
she's reversing it!

568
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:10,500
Look at that. It's getting hot.

569
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:13,100
I said, terminate!

570
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:18,400
Burn out her mind!

571
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:20,700
Oh no you don't!

572
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:24,000
You should've
promoted me years back!

573
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,800
She's venting the heat up here.

574
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:54,100
The Jagrafess needs to stay cool and
now it's sitting on top of a volcano!

575
00:38:56,900 --> 00:38:58,100
GRRR!

576
00:38:58,100 --> 00:39:02,500
Oh, um, yes, I'm trying, sir,
but I don't know how she did it,
it's impossible!

577
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:04,300
A member of staff
with an idea!

578
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:14,400
What do I do?

579
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:15,500
Flick the switch!

580
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:25,300
ALARM SOUNDS

581
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:34,100
Oi, mate!
You want to bank on a certainty?

582
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:35,900
Massive heat, in a massive body. . .

583
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,800
Massive bang!

584
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:39,400
See you in the headlines!

585
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:48,600
If it's all the same to you,
I think I'll resign. Bye, then.

586
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:52,900
Let go of me!

587
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:04,100
Let go of me!

588
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:05,900
Let go of me!

589
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:31,600
We're just gonna go, I hate tidying up.
Too many questions. You'll manage.

590
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:36,700
You'll have to stay and explain it,
no-one's gonna believe me.
Why, they might believe a lot of things.

591
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:42,400
Human race should accelerate.
All back to normal. What about your
friend? He's not my friend.

592
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:44,300
Now, don't. . .

593
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:47,800
I'm all right now. Much better.

594
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:50,100
And I've got the key.
Look, it's. . .

595
00:40:50,100 --> 00:40:51,700
And, well. . .

596
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:54,500
it all worked out for the best,
didn't it?

597
00:40:54,500 --> 00:41:01,200
You know it's not actually my fault
because you were in charge.

598
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:03,300
It's my house!

599
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:06,800
I'm home. Oh, my God, I'm home!

600
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:10,000
Blimey. I thought you were
gonna chuck me out of an airlock.

601
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,400
Is there something else
you want to tell me?

602
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:15,000
No. Erm, what d'you mean?

603
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:20,600
The archive of Satellite Five.
One second of that message
could've changed the world.

604
00:41:28,300 --> 00:41:30,400
That's it then. See ya.

605
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:32,700
How d'you mean, "see ya"?
As in, goodbye.

606
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:37,400
What about me? You can't just
go, I've got my head. I've got
a chip type two, my head opens!

607
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:39,500
What, like this?

608
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:42,700
Don't! Don't do what?

609
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:45,700
Stop it!

610
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:48,200
All right now, Doctor.
That's enough. Stop it.

611
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,600
Thank you.

612
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:55,500
Oi! Sorry, I couldn't resist.

613
00:41:55,500 --> 00:42:00,700
The whole of history could've changed
because of you. I just wanted to
help. You were helping yourself.

614
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:03,400
I've said I'm sorry,
and I am, I really am.

615
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:06,000
But you can't just leave me like this. 
Yes, I can.

616
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,500
'Cos if you show that head to anyone,
they'll dissect you in seconds.

617
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:13,100
You'll have to live a very
quiet life. Keep out of trouble.
Be average. Unseen. Good luck.

618
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:14,500
But I wanna come with you.

619
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:16,700
I only take the best.

620
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:19,500
I've got Rose.

621
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:21,100
Rose, Rose!

622
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:22,200
Oh, my God!

623
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:23,300
Who's that?

624
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:26,400
Geoff, is that you? It's me, Mum.

625
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:28,200
Don't come in, wait there a minute.

626
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:31,600
Oh, my Lord! You never told me
you were coming home!

627
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:33,400
Hold on, I'll just take my coat off!

628
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:37,300
I wish you'd told me you were
coming home. Rose, take me with you.

629
00:42:37,300 --> 00:42:40,600
I would've got your favourite tea in.

630
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:43,000
THROBBING HUM
What's that noise?

631
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,800
Have you left the back door open?

632
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:47,100
Blimey, there's a draught.

633
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:48,500
What a surprise!

634
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:50,800
Oh, let me look at you.

635
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:56,000
Aw, six months. It's like
I saw you yesterday. Isn't it funny?

636
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,900
The time goes by like that.
CLICK

637
00:42:57,900 --> 00:42:59,500
WHIRR!

638
00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:06,900
Your wish is my command,
but be careful what you wish for.

639
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,200
The day my father died.

640
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:12,600
I thought it would be grim and
stormy, it's just an ordinary day.
Oh, gosh, this is it!

641
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:13,800
He can't die on his own!

642
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
Can I try again?

643
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:19,900
Oh, gosh, this is it.

644
00:43:19,900 --> 00:43:21,500
Rose! No!

645
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:25,300
I did it again,
I picked another stupid ape!

646
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:27,300
It's not like I've changed history.

647
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:30,600
Rose, there's a man alive in the
world who wasn't alive before.

648
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:33,200
The whole world's different
because he's alive!

649
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:37,500
Time's been damaged and they've
come to sterilise the wound.

650
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:39,400
Rose, get in the church!

651
