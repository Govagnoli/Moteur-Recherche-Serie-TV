1
00:00:36,708 --> 00:00:38,960  X1:188 X2:531 Y1:488 Y2:523
Doctor! Doctor! Look out!

2
00:00:43,655 --> 00:00:48,210  X1:108 X2:611 Y1:452 Y2:523
Where's he gone? Have you seen him?
There he is. Stop! No!

3
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:50,607  X1:286 X2:433 Y1:488 Y2:523
Watch out!

4
00:00:50,647 --> 00:00:53,110  X1:264 X2:455 Y1:488 Y2:523
There! There!

5
00:00:56,721 --> 00:00:58,641  X1:078 X2:289 Y1:488 Y2:523
LOW GROWLING

6
00:00:58,681 --> 00:01:01,553  X1:078 X2:259 Y1:488 Y2:523
WATER DRIPS

7
00:01:05,233 --> 00:01:07,042  X1:078 X2:259 Y1:488 Y2:523
LOW GROWLS

8
00:01:22,135 --> 00:01:25,371  X1:242 X2:477 Y1:452 Y2:523
That's what it did.
It went ROAR!

9
00:01:25,411 --> 00:01:30,886  X1:176 X2:543 Y1:416 Y2:523
And if you think that was the
most exciting day of my life,
wait till you hear the rest.

10
00:01:30,926 --> 00:01:32,524  X1:298 X2:421 Y1:488 Y2:523
Oh, boy!

11
00:02:09,007 --> 00:02:12,170  X1:210 X2:509 Y1:452 Y2:523
So there I was, with
that thing going ROAR!

12
00:02:15,557 --> 00:02:18,796  X1:140 X2:577 Y1:488 Y2:523
Here boy, eat the food. Come on.

13
00:02:18,836 --> 00:02:22,473  X1:192 X2:527 Y1:416 Y2:487
Look at the lovely food.
Isn't that nice? Yes, it is!

14
00:02:22,513 --> 00:02:24,033  X1:202 X2:517 Y1:488 Y2:523
Get out of here, quickly!

15
00:02:24,073 --> 00:02:27,753  X1:150 X2:569 Y1:452 Y2:523
Who would like a porkie choppie,
then? I said, "RUN!"

16
00:02:30,944 --> 00:02:32,497  X1:136 X2:583 Y1:488 Y2:523
Wrong one! You've made it worse!

17
00:02:32,537 --> 00:02:36,388  X1:142 X2:575 Y1:488 Y2:523
You said, "Blue!" I said NOT blue!

18
00:02:38,492 --> 00:02:40,175  X1:300 X2:419 Y1:488 Y2:523
Hold on.

19
00:02:45,409 --> 00:02:48,243  X1:316 X2:403 Y1:488 Y2:523
Ahhh!

20
00:02:48,283 --> 00:02:50,746  X1:258 X2:461 Y1:488 Y2:523
Aaagh! Aaagh!

21
00:03:02,789 --> 00:03:05,212  X1:300 X2:419 Y1:488 Y2:523
Hold on.

22
00:03:05,909 --> 00:03:07,922  X1:242 X2:477 Y1:488 Y2:523
Don't I know you?

23
00:03:16,214 --> 00:03:19,370  X1:078 X2:287 Y1:488 Y2:523
TARDIS WHIRRS

24
00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:22,288  X1:216 X2:503 Y1:452 Y2:523
You can't imagine it.
The Doctor's machine.

25
00:03:22,328 --> 00:03:26,122  X1:196 X2:523 Y1:452 Y2:523
The most beautiful sound
in the world.

26
00:03:26,162 --> 00:03:31,958  X1:162 X2:557 Y1:416 Y2:523
That wasn't the first time I met
the Doctor and it certainly
wasn't the last. Oh, no!

27
00:03:31,998 --> 00:03:36,193  X1:146 X2:573 Y1:452 Y2:523
I just put that bit at the beginning
because it's a brilliant opening.

28
00:03:36,233 --> 00:03:42,227  X1:152 X2:565 Y1:452 Y2:523
This is the story of me and my
encounters with alien life forms.

29
00:03:42,267 --> 00:03:44,904  X1:258 X2:461 Y1:488 Y2:523
But be warned!

30
00:03:44,944 --> 00:03:48,021  X1:140 X2:579 Y1:488 Y2:523
Because it is gonna get sca-a-ary.

31
00:03:49,858 --> 00:03:51,695  X1:166 X2:553 Y1:488 Y2:523
I need a remote control zoom.

32
00:03:51,735 --> 00:03:55,292  X1:182 X2:537 Y1:452 Y2:523
I'm having to do that
with the lean, sca-a-a-ary.

33
00:03:55,332 --> 00:04:00,167  X1:126 X2:593 Y1:452 Y2:523
But look, don't worry, cos it's not
just me sitting here talking. Oh, no.

34
00:04:00,207 --> 00:04:03,644  X1:154 X2:565 Y1:488 Y2:523
That's Ursula on camera. Hello!

35
00:04:03,684 --> 00:04:06,920  X1:168 X2:551 Y1:452 Y2:523
My good friend, Ursula Blake.
On my brand new camera.

36
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:11,238  X1:112 X2:607 Y1:488 Y2:523
That was my family home, down there.

37
00:04:11,278 --> 00:04:14,715  X1:116 X2:603 Y1:452 Y2:523
I did try,
but there's two women live there now.

38
00:04:14,755 --> 00:04:16,512  X1:226 X2:493 Y1:488 Y2:523
They're a bit severe.

39
00:04:16,552 --> 00:04:20,306  X1:168 X2:551 Y1:452 Y2:523
Never mind,
but that's where it all started.

40
00:04:20,346 --> 00:04:23,059  X1:182 X2:537 Y1:452 Y2:523
Cos that's
when I first met the Doctor.

41
00:04:25,059 --> 00:04:28,737  X1:180 X2:537 Y1:452 Y2:523
What was it, I must've been
three or four years old.

42
00:04:28,777 --> 00:04:32,571  X1:236 X2:483 Y1:452 Y2:523
Middle of the night
I went downstairs

43
00:04:32,611 --> 00:04:35,278  X1:192 X2:527 Y1:488 Y2:523
and there was this...man.

44
00:04:39,284 --> 00:04:42,002  X1:248 X2:471 Y1:488 Y2:523
What happened?

45
00:04:42,042 --> 00:04:44,300  X1:126 X2:591 Y1:488 Y2:523
Elton? Tell me. Why was he there?

46
00:04:46,759 --> 00:04:49,057  X1:192 X2:525 Y1:488 Y2:523
I dunno. Still don't know.

47
00:04:50,553 --> 00:04:52,692  X1:230 X2:489 Y1:488 Y2:523
All those years ago.

48
00:04:58,388 --> 00:05:00,303  X1:218 X2:501 Y1:488 Y2:523
OK! First things first.

49
00:05:00,343 --> 00:05:03,625  X1:192 X2:527 Y1:452 Y2:523
My name is Elton,
not to be confused with...

50
00:05:05,376 --> 00:05:09,332  X1:126 X2:591 Y1:452 Y2:523
I left school. I got a job,
transport manager for Rita Logistics,

51
00:05:09,372 --> 00:05:13,770  X1:148 X2:571 Y1:452 Y2:523
modest little haulage company,
perfectly normal life, and then...

52
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:16,126  X1:254 X2:463 Y1:488 Y2:523
it all went mad!

53
00:05:16,166 --> 00:05:18,404  X1:170 X2:549 Y1:488 Y2:523
Two years ago, I was in town.

54
00:05:18,444 --> 00:05:22,161  X1:136 X2:581 Y1:452 Y2:523
I was stocking up,
nothing special, all the usual stuff.

55
00:05:22,201 --> 00:05:24,041  X1:208 X2:511 Y1:488 Y2:523
When all of a sudden...

56
00:05:24,081 --> 00:05:26,669  X1:078 X2:295 Y1:488 Y2:523
PEOPLE SCREAM

57
00:05:32,312 --> 00:05:34,388  X1:206 X2:511 Y1:488 Y2:523
Shop window dummies!

58
00:05:34,428 --> 00:05:36,515  X1:272 X2:447 Y1:488 Y2:523
Come to life!

59
00:05:44,978 --> 00:05:48,251  X1:204 X2:515 Y1:488 Y2:523
I survived... Obviously.

60
00:05:48,291 --> 00:05:51,489  X1:222 X2:497 Y1:452 Y2:523
Twelve months later,
I'm back in town,

61
00:05:51,529 --> 00:05:56,529  X1:152 X2:567 Y1:452 Y2:523
looking for a new suit,
when I hear this plane overhead.

62
00:06:05,914 --> 00:06:07,768  X1:078 X2:175 Y1:488 Y2:523
DONG!

63
00:06:09,511 --> 00:06:12,748  X1:186 X2:531 Y1:452 Y2:523
But it wasn't over yet!
Cos then, Christmas Day...

64
00:06:12,788 --> 00:06:17,982  X1:146 X2:571 Y1:452 Y2:523
I'm in bed, fast asleep, nice
and cosy, when all of a sudden...

65
00:06:18,022 --> 00:06:20,659  X1:238 X2:479 Y1:488 Y2:523
Like, ptscccchhhh!

66
00:06:20,699 --> 00:06:25,572  X1:148 X2:569 Y1:452 Y2:523
I'm stuck in bed cos there's glass
everywhere and I was barefoot.

67
00:06:25,612 --> 00:06:31,590  X1:126 X2:593 Y1:416 Y2:523
I had to invent this rudimentary
pulley system just to reach my boots
and by the time I'd done that...

68
00:06:38,999 --> 00:06:42,035  X1:130 X2:589 Y1:488 Y2:523
that's when it all started happening.

69
00:06:42,075 --> 00:06:46,433  X1:150 X2:569 Y1:416 Y2:523
That's how I met Ursula.
His name is the Doctor.
That's how I met Victor Kennedy.

70
00:06:46,473 --> 00:06:47,593  X1:252 X2:467 Y1:488 Y2:523
You stupid man!

71
00:06:47,633 --> 00:06:50,309  X1:170 X2:549 Y1:452 Y2:523
That's how I met Jackie Tyler.
You don't meet many Elton's.

72
00:06:50,349 --> 00:06:54,180  X1:202 X2:517 Y1:452 Y2:523
And that's how I
finally met the Doctor...

73
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:56,762  X1:214 X2:505 Y1:488 Y2:523
and realised the truth.

74
00:07:04,691 --> 00:07:06,288  X1:274 X2:445 Y1:488 Y2:523
I should say,

75
00:07:06,328 --> 00:07:11,326  X1:156 X2:561 Y1:452 Y2:523
this isn't my whole life -
it's not all spaceships and stuff.

76
00:07:11,366 --> 00:07:13,803  X1:164 X2:555 Y1:488 Y2:523
Cos I'm into all sorts of things.

77
00:07:13,843 --> 00:07:15,559  X1:266 X2:453 Y1:488 Y2:523
I like football.

78
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:18,597  X1:190 X2:529 Y1:488 Y2:523
I like a drink. I like Spain.

79
00:07:18,637 --> 00:07:22,754  X1:156 X2:563 Y1:452 Y2:523
And if there's one thing I really,
really love,

80
00:07:22,794 --> 00:07:26,908  X1:154 X2:563 Y1:452 Y2:523
then it's Jeff Lynne
and the Electric Light Orchestra.

81
00:07:26,948 --> 00:07:29,126  X1:162 X2:557 Y1:488 Y2:523
Cos you can't beat a bit of ELO.

82
00:07:34,059 --> 00:07:36,976  X1:164 X2:555 Y1:488 Y2:523
# The sun is shining in the sky

83
00:07:37,016 --> 00:07:40,013  X1:174 X2:545 Y1:488 Y2:523
# There ain't a cloud in sight

84
00:07:40,053 --> 00:07:41,617  X1:218 X2:501 Y1:488 Y2:523
# It's stopped raining

85
00:07:42,010 --> 00:07:43,811  X1:196 X2:523 Y1:488 Y2:523
# Everybody's in the play

86
00:07:43,851 --> 00:07:46,678  X1:216 X2:503 Y1:452 Y2:523
# And don't you know
it's a beautiful day

87
00:07:48,204 --> 00:07:50,058  X1:214 X2:505 Y1:488 Y2:523
# Hey, hey, hey... #

88
00:07:51,281 --> 00:07:52,481  X1:332 X2:387 Y1:488 Y2:523
So!

89
00:07:52,521 --> 00:07:55,879  X1:150 X2:569 Y1:452 Y2:523
Great big spaceship hanging over
London, imagine the theories!

90
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:59,075  X1:146 X2:573 Y1:488 Y2:523
The internet went into meltdown!

91
00:07:59,115 --> 00:08:00,832  X1:218 X2:499 Y1:488 Y2:523
But I kept on digging.

92
00:08:00,872 --> 00:08:02,590  X1:198 X2:521 Y1:488 Y2:523
Something was going on.

93
00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:07,223  X1:178 X2:541 Y1:452 Y2:523
Oh, yes! And then one day,
on some obscure little blog

94
00:08:07,263 --> 00:08:13,858  X1:150 X2:567 Y1:452 Y2:523
by someone called Ursula Blake,
it was like a chance in a million.

95
00:08:13,898 --> 00:08:19,612  X1:164 X2:555 Y1:416 Y2:523
'It was him. It was that man
again, but the photo was new,
it was taken on Christmas Day.

96
00:08:19,652 --> 00:08:25,926  X1:148 X2:569 Y1:416 Y2:523
'But Christmas just gone
and he looked exactly the same.'
His name is the Doctor.

97
00:08:25,966 --> 00:08:29,881  X1:112 X2:607 Y1:488 Y2:523
Doctor what? That's all anyone knows.

98
00:08:29,921 --> 00:08:33,237  X1:154 X2:565 Y1:452 Y2:523
But Christmas Day, I was
taking photos all over the place.

99
00:08:33,277 --> 00:08:37,035  X1:146 X2:571 Y1:452 Y2:523
I went mad with it all, spaceships
and lasers and everything.

100
00:08:37,075 --> 00:08:43,385  X1:160 X2:559 Y1:416 Y2:523
We all went to Trafalgar Square
that night, cos everyone was
celebrating, just being alive.

101
00:08:43,425 --> 00:08:46,782  X1:134 X2:585 Y1:452 Y2:523
I snapped him in passing,
that's all. He was just some bloke.

102
00:08:46,822 --> 00:08:50,777  X1:146 X2:573 Y1:452 Y2:523
I didn't realise he was significant,
until Mr Skinner pointed it out.

103
00:08:50,817 --> 00:08:53,256  X1:236 X2:483 Y1:488 Y2:523
Who's Mr Skinner?

104
00:08:53,296 --> 00:08:55,533  X1:206 X2:513 Y1:488 Y2:523
Oh, there's a few of us.

105
00:08:55,573 --> 00:08:59,488  X1:204 X2:515 Y1:452 Y2:523
The inner sanctum.
All studying this Doctor.

106
00:08:59,528 --> 00:09:03,644  X1:188 X2:531 Y1:452 Y2:523
I've seen him,
the Doctor, I swear to you.

107
00:09:03,684 --> 00:09:06,844  X1:130 X2:587 Y1:452 Y2:523
I saw him when I was a kid. He was
in my house and he was downstairs.

108
00:09:06,884 --> 00:09:11,999  X1:124 X2:595 Y1:452 Y2:523
Don't tell me. He looked exactly
the same then as he does now. Yes!

109
00:09:12,039 --> 00:09:13,842  X1:324 X2:395 Y1:488 Y2:523
Yes!

110
00:09:17,033 --> 00:09:19,536  X1:170 X2:549 Y1:488 Y2:523
Oh, my God, you believe me!

111
00:09:20,590 --> 00:09:24,300  X1:182 X2:537 Y1:452 Y2:523
'So that's how I met Ursula.
All thanks to the Doctor.

112
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:28,418  X1:126 X2:593 Y1:452 Y2:523
'Turns out we read all the same sites
and she only lived half a mile away.

113
00:09:28,458 --> 00:09:31,899  X1:180 X2:539 Y1:452 Y2:523
She was like a proper mate.
Poor Ursula.'

114
00:09:34,692 --> 00:09:39,127  X1:150 X2:569 Y1:452 Y2:523
But like she said, there was this
little community, the select few,

115
00:09:39,167 --> 00:09:42,123  X1:140 X2:579 Y1:488 Y2:523
all with their stories of the Doctor.

116
00:09:42,163 --> 00:09:46,214  X1:146 X2:571 Y1:416 Y2:523
'This little gang used to meet up,
underneath the old library
on Maccateer Street.

117
00:09:46,254 --> 00:09:50,535  X1:124 X2:595 Y1:452 Y2:523
'Mr Skinner, first name Colin,
but we always called him Mr Skinner.

118
00:09:50,575 --> 00:09:55,332  X1:162 X2:557 Y1:452 Y2:523
'I don't know why, we just did.'
To me, the Doctor isn't a man,

119
00:09:55,372 --> 00:09:58,566  X1:218 X2:501 Y1:452 Y2:523
he's more a collection
of archetypes...

120
00:09:58,606 --> 00:10:02,680  X1:124 X2:595 Y1:416 Y2:487
'Then there was Bridget.' All
these different Doctors come and go,

121
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:08,754  X1:152 X2:567 Y1:416 Y2:523
but the single constant factor
is this faux-police box. It keeps
cropping up, throughout history.

122
00:10:08,794 --> 00:10:13,192  X1:124 X2:595 Y1:452 Y2:523
'She lived way up north but she
travelled down just for the meetings.

123
00:10:13,232 --> 00:10:15,749  X1:202 X2:517 Y1:452 Y2:523
'Then there was Bliss...'
What I'm trying to do,

124
00:10:15,789 --> 00:10:19,303  X1:220 X2:499 Y1:452 Y2:523
is sum up the Doctor,
what he means to us.

125
00:10:19,343 --> 00:10:20,983  X1:166 X2:553 Y1:488 Y2:523
'She was ever so sweet, Bliss.

126
00:10:21,023 --> 00:10:26,976  X1:160 X2:557 Y1:416 Y2:523
'"Bless Bliss," we used to say.'
What he could represent
and what he should represent

127
00:10:27,016 --> 00:10:29,934  X1:262 X2:457 Y1:488 Y2:523
and what he...

128
00:10:29,974 --> 00:10:34,211  X1:156 X2:561 Y1:452 Y2:523
never won't represent, sort of
thing. We should have a name.

129
00:10:34,251 --> 00:10:37,685  X1:214 X2:505 Y1:488 Y2:523
You know, as a group.

130
00:10:37,725 --> 00:10:40,045  X1:186 X2:531 Y1:488 Y2:523
Names are very important.

131
00:10:40,085 --> 00:10:44,717  X1:114 X2:605 Y1:452 Y2:523
What we need is a good, strong name,
like a team, something like...

132
00:10:44,757 --> 00:10:48,514  X1:224 X2:495 Y1:452 Y2:523
London Investigation
'n' Detective Agency.

133
00:10:48,554 --> 00:10:50,670  X1:166 X2:553 Y1:488 Y2:523
LINDA for short. Say it again?

134
00:10:50,710 --> 00:10:55,068  X1:224 X2:495 Y1:452 Y2:523
London Investigation
'n' Detective Agency.

135
00:10:55,108 --> 00:10:57,184  X1:234 X2:483 Y1:488 Y2:523
'N'? Fish 'n' chips!

136
00:10:57,224 --> 00:11:01,061  X1:128 X2:591 Y1:488 Y2:523
Rock 'n' roll! Chakademus 'n' Pliers!

137
00:11:01,101 --> 00:11:04,496  X1:156 X2:563 Y1:452 Y2:523
LINDA! Oh, I like it, it's not too
solemn! I like the 'N'!

138
00:11:04,536 --> 00:11:07,976  X1:158 X2:561 Y1:452 Y2:523
We're the men from LINDA!
And the women! LINDA united!

139
00:11:08,016 --> 00:11:11,325  X1:138 X2:581 Y1:452 Y2:523
Did you think of that on the spot?
No, I've wanted to use it for years.

140
00:11:11,365 --> 00:11:15,324  X1:078 X2:477 Y1:452 Y2:523
I give you, LINDA!
ALL: LINDA!

141
00:11:15,364 --> 00:11:17,401  X1:078 X2:503 Y1:488 Y2:523
So we'd all meet up, every week.

142
00:11:17,441 --> 00:11:19,878  X1:078 X2:535 Y1:488 Y2:523
We'd talk about the Doctor for a bit,

143
00:11:19,918 --> 00:11:22,278  X1:204 X2:515 Y1:452 Y2:523
but after a while,
Bridget started cooking.

144
00:11:22,318 --> 00:11:24,795  X1:168 X2:551 Y1:488 Y2:523
Oh, my God, that's gorgeous!

145
00:11:24,835 --> 00:11:28,349  X1:132 X2:585 Y1:452 Y2:523
No, really. Wow!
Oh, rest of you, get your hands off!

146
00:11:28,389 --> 00:11:32,465  X1:144 X2:575 Y1:416 Y2:523
'Next thing you know,
Mr Skinner started his readings,
cos he was writing his own novel.'

147
00:11:32,505 --> 00:11:38,103  X1:136 X2:581 Y1:416 Y2:523
"That's the last time you ride the
Ghost Train, Johnny Franzetta, now
say your prayers!"

148
00:11:38,143 --> 00:11:40,660  X1:250 X2:469 Y1:488 Y2:523
To be continued.

149
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:45,093  X1:122 X2:595 Y1:452 Y2:523
No-o-o-o! 'Time went on, we got to
know each other better and better.'

150
00:11:45,133 --> 00:11:49,029  X1:172 X2:547 Y1:452 Y2:523
I only started all this because
my daughter disappeared.

151
00:11:50,486 --> 00:11:53,123  X1:232 X2:485 Y1:452 Y2:523
But it wasn't aliens
that took her away.

152
00:11:53,163 --> 00:11:56,439  X1:246 X2:473 Y1:488 Y2:523
It was just drugs.

153
00:11:56,479 --> 00:12:01,650  X1:138 X2:581 Y1:452 Y2:523
I come down to London every week
and I just keep looking for her.

154
00:12:04,194 --> 00:12:07,106  X1:264 X2:455 Y1:488 Y2:523
Oh, Bridget...

155
00:12:09,027 --> 00:12:11,945  X1:188 X2:531 Y1:488 Y2:523
# I gave my love a chicken

156
00:12:11,985 --> 00:12:15,802  X1:248 X2:471 Y1:488 Y2:523
# It had no bone

157
00:12:17,379 --> 00:12:20,096  X1:194 X2:523 Y1:488 Y2:523
# I gave my love a cherry

158
00:12:20,136 --> 00:12:23,652  X1:208 X2:511 Y1:488 Y2:523
# It had no stone... #

159
00:12:23,692 --> 00:12:28,488  X1:212 X2:507 Y1:452 Y2:523
# I've got a brand new
pair of roller-skates

160
00:12:28,528 --> 00:12:30,845  X1:128 X2:591 Y1:488 Y2:523
# You've got a brand-new key... #

161
00:12:30,885 --> 00:12:34,001  X1:180 X2:537 Y1:452 Y2:523
'Then it turned out that
Bridget could play the piano

162
00:12:34,041 --> 00:12:38,870  X1:124 X2:595 Y1:452 Y2:523
and I confessed my love of ELO.
Next thing you know, musical LINDA!

163
00:12:47,666 --> 00:12:51,265  X1:216 X2:503 Y1:452 Y2:523
# You got me running
going out of my mind

164
00:12:51,305 --> 00:12:55,060  X1:198 X2:519 Y1:452 Y2:523
# You got me thinking
that I'm wasting my time

165
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:57,577  X1:172 X2:545 Y1:488 Y2:523
# Don't bring me down... #

166
00:12:57,617 --> 00:12:58,657  X1:278 X2:439 Y1:488 Y2:523
Just for fun.

167
00:12:58,697 --> 00:13:01,295  X1:172 X2:545 Y1:488 Y2:523
# Don't bring me down... #

168
00:13:01,335 --> 00:13:03,929  X1:300 X2:419 Y1:488 Y2:523
Your go.

169
00:13:03,969 --> 00:13:07,695  X1:236 X2:481 Y1:488 Y2:523
Grooves! Your go.

170
00:13:09,563 --> 00:13:12,100  X1:162 X2:557 Y1:488 Y2:523
Now, careful, mind the cables.

171
00:13:25,265 --> 00:13:26,945  X1:158 X2:559 Y1:488 Y2:523
'And that's when it all changed.

172
00:13:26,985 --> 00:13:29,063  X1:172 X2:547 Y1:488 Y2:523
'That Tuesday night in March.

173
00:13:29,103 --> 00:13:31,691  X1:202 X2:517 Y1:488 Y2:523
'That's when he arrived.'

174
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:39,770  X1:106 X2:613 Y1:452 Y2:523
Lights. 'That's when we met Victor
Kennedy and the Golden Age was gone.'

175
00:13:39,810 --> 00:13:42,807  X1:226 X2:493 Y1:488 Y2:523
So, we meet at last.

176
00:13:42,847 --> 00:13:46,841  X1:132 X2:585 Y1:452 Y2:523
"LINDA". Pleased to meet you, sir.
I'm sorry, was the music too loud?

177
00:13:46,881 --> 00:13:48,401  X1:150 X2:567 Y1:488 Y2:523
No, no, no, I don't shake hands.

178
00:13:48,441 --> 00:13:50,041  X1:166 X2:553 Y1:452 Y2:523
Back, back.
I suffer from a skin complaint.

179
00:13:50,081 --> 00:13:52,359  X1:132 X2:585 Y1:488 Y2:523
Ex-ee-ma. Oh, you mean Eczema.

180
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:58,590  X1:154 X2:565 Y1:416 Y2:523
Oh, this is worse, much worse,
I blister to the touch. Back,
back, all of you further, further.

181
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:01,430  X1:284 X2:433 Y1:488 Y2:523
Thank you.

182
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:05,743  X1:172 X2:547 Y1:452 Y2:523
Sorry, don't mind me asking,
but who are you?

183
00:14:05,783 --> 00:14:09,501  X1:230 X2:489 Y1:488 Y2:523
I am your salvation.

184
00:14:09,541 --> 00:14:12,058  X1:242 X2:477 Y1:452 Y2:523
That's the Doctor.
That's really him.

185
00:14:12,098 --> 00:14:14,495  X1:228 X2:491 Y1:452 Y2:523
You've forgotten
your purpose in life.

186
00:14:14,535 --> 00:14:20,209  X1:178 X2:539 Y1:416 Y2:523
You with your band and your
cakes and your blubbing and
all the while he still exists.

187
00:14:20,249 --> 00:14:22,326  X1:130 X2:589 Y1:488 Y2:523
The Doctor. Look at him. Just look!

188
00:14:22,366 --> 00:14:26,043  X1:144 X2:575 Y1:488 Y2:523
Move back! Move back all of you.

189
00:14:26,083 --> 00:14:29,596  X1:146 X2:573 Y1:452 Y2:523
Wait for this bit. The picture
cuts out but the sound continues.

190
00:14:29,636 --> 00:14:33,874  X1:174 X2:545 Y1:452 Y2:523
Listen. Just listen. Listen
to the sound of the universe.

191
00:14:33,914 --> 00:14:36,331  X1:078 X2:373 Y1:488 Y2:523
SOUND OF THE TARDIS

192
00:14:41,026 --> 00:14:43,733  X1:298 X2:419 Y1:488 Y2:523
That's...

193
00:14:45,863 --> 00:14:48,819  X1:110 X2:607 Y1:488 Y2:523
What is it? What's wrong? Leave him!

194
00:14:48,859 --> 00:14:50,896  X1:128 X2:591 Y1:488 Y2:523
You've heard it before, haven't you?

195
00:14:50,936 --> 00:14:54,411  X1:162 X2:557 Y1:452 Y2:523
When? When was it? Where?
Where were you?

196
00:14:54,451 --> 00:14:56,407  X1:260 X2:459 Y1:488 Y2:523
I'd forgotten...

197
00:14:56,447 --> 00:14:59,165  X1:302 X2:417 Y1:488 Y2:523
till now.

198
00:14:59,205 --> 00:15:01,565  X1:222 X2:497 Y1:488 Y2:523
But it was that night.

199
00:15:01,605 --> 00:15:03,123  X1:276 X2:441 Y1:488 Y2:523
What night?

200
00:15:04,679 --> 00:15:06,362  X1:256 X2:463 Y1:488 Y2:523
I was just a kid.

201
00:15:07,878 --> 00:15:10,236  X1:172 X2:547 Y1:488 Y2:523
That's why I went downstairs.

202
00:15:10,276 --> 00:15:13,153  X1:260 X2:459 Y1:488 Y2:523
It woke me up.

203
00:15:13,193 --> 00:15:17,249  X1:078 X2:447 Y1:452 Y2:523
That noise...
TARDIS WHIRRS

204
00:15:20,383 --> 00:15:22,181  X1:262 X2:457 Y1:488 Y2:523
But what is it?

205
00:15:22,221 --> 00:15:27,857  X1:140 X2:579 Y1:452 Y2:523
What does it mean?
That is the sound of his spaceship.

206
00:15:27,897 --> 00:15:30,935  X1:188 X2:529 Y1:452 Y2:523
Right then! Homework!
Using the Torchwood files,

207
00:15:30,975 --> 00:15:34,446  X1:152 X2:567 Y1:452 Y2:523
we can look at the old databases
in a completely new light.

208
00:15:34,486 --> 00:15:40,161  X1:140 X2:579 Y1:416 Y2:523
We are able to build up a more
detailed profile of the Doctor.
I've allocated tasks to each of you.

209
00:15:40,201 --> 00:15:43,121  X1:196 X2:523 Y1:452 Y2:523
I'd like you to... Careful!
Watch the ex-ee-ma!

210
00:15:43,161 --> 00:15:45,277  X1:212 X2:507 Y1:452 Y2:523
I would like you to
complete your targets.

211
00:15:45,317 --> 00:15:50,032  X1:164 X2:555 Y1:416 Y2:523
We'll meet back here this time
next week, one step closer
to catching the Doctor.

212
00:15:50,072 --> 00:15:52,832  X1:150 X2:569 Y1:488 Y2:523
Well, don't just sit there! Move!

213
00:15:52,872 --> 00:15:56,109  X1:164 X2:553 Y1:488 Y2:523
Um, Bliss. It is Bliss, isn't it?

214
00:15:56,149 --> 00:16:00,142  X1:180 X2:537 Y1:452 Y2:523
Yes. Could I have a word
with you in private, please?

215
00:16:00,182 --> 00:16:03,860  X1:142 X2:577 Y1:488 Y2:523
Course you can, yeah. Thank you.

216
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:05,464  X1:232 X2:487 Y1:488 Y2:523
Goodbye, goodbye.

217
00:16:07,057 --> 00:16:10,168  X1:160 X2:559 Y1:488 Y2:523
Better get to work. Lots to do.

218
00:16:10,208 --> 00:16:13,768  X1:146 X2:573 Y1:452 Y2:523
I never thought of it as work. It's
what we always wanted, though -

219
00:16:13,808 --> 00:16:16,805  X1:128 X2:591 Y1:488 Y2:523
to find the Doctor. Yeah, I suppose.

220
00:16:16,845 --> 00:16:18,922  X1:078 X2:271 Y1:488 Y2:523
GIRL SCREAMS

221
00:16:18,962 --> 00:16:24,201  X1:128 X2:591 Y1:416 Y2:523
All of a sudden, without
anyone saying so,
we were working for Victor Kennedy.

222
00:16:27,434 --> 00:16:32,948  X1:110 X2:607 Y1:452 Y2:523
'And we had to admit, he was right,
his methods were much more rigorous.

223
00:16:32,988 --> 00:16:36,745  X1:146 X2:573 Y1:452 Y2:523
'It felt like we were getting closer
and closer to the Doctor.'

224
00:16:36,785 --> 00:16:39,620  X1:234 X2:483 Y1:488 Y2:523
Mr Kennedy? Yes.

225
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:45,213  X1:146 X2:573 Y1:452 Y2:523
We were wondering... No sign of
Bliss, do you know where she is?

226
00:16:45,253 --> 00:16:50,407  X1:156 X2:563 Y1:416 Y2:523
Yes. Didn't she tell you? She's
getting married.
She left a message.

227
00:16:50,447 --> 00:16:53,854  X1:186 X2:533 Y1:452 Y2:523
It'll never last. Stupid girl.
Come on, back to work!

228
00:16:55,601 --> 00:16:58,681  X1:166 X2:553 Y1:452 Y2:523
But we did get lucky once.
A police box, newly-arrived...

229
00:16:58,721 --> 00:17:01,758  X1:228 X2:491 Y1:452 Y2:523
It says newly arrived
today in Woolwich.

230
00:17:01,798 --> 00:17:05,431  X1:178 X2:541 Y1:452 Y2:523
Well, don't just stand there!
Move! Move! Go! Go!

231
00:17:05,471 --> 00:17:08,749  X1:192 X2:527 Y1:452 Y2:523
But don't get excited.
That's where you came in.

232
00:17:08,789 --> 00:17:12,586  X1:200 X2:519 Y1:452 Y2:523
Woolwich, police box,
red bucket, blue bucket,

233
00:17:12,626 --> 00:17:15,102  X1:228 X2:491 Y1:488 Y2:523
me so stupid, etc...

234
00:17:15,142 --> 00:17:17,340  X1:220 X2:499 Y1:488 Y2:523
Useless! I just froze!

235
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:20,418  X1:172 X2:545 Y1:452 Y2:523
You met him and you froze?!
You stupid man!

236
00:17:20,458 --> 00:17:23,971  X1:140 X2:577 Y1:452 Y2:523
You can't hit me cos you don't
touch, you said so. I can use this!

237
00:17:24,011 --> 00:17:27,809  X1:160 X2:559 Y1:452 Y2:523
Use that cane on him and you'll
get one hell of a smack off me!

238
00:17:27,849 --> 00:17:32,363  X1:120 X2:599 Y1:452 Y2:523
And then a good kick. Is that
completely understood, Mr Kennedy?

239
00:17:32,403 --> 00:17:34,999  X1:280 X2:437 Y1:488 Y2:523
Duly noted.

240
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:37,439  X1:268 X2:449 Y1:488 Y2:523
Ursula Blake,

241
00:17:37,479 --> 00:17:40,351  X1:198 X2:519 Y1:488 Y2:523
most likely to fight back.

242
00:17:42,114 --> 00:17:45,790  X1:162 X2:555 Y1:452 Y2:523
Right then! We'll change tack.
We'll approach this sideways.

243
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:49,505  X1:210 X2:509 Y1:452 Y2:523
If we're to discover the
truth about the Doctor,

244
00:17:49,545 --> 00:17:52,505  X1:152 X2:565 Y1:488 Y2:523
then we should try to find...her.

245
00:17:52,545 --> 00:17:57,378  X1:168 X2:551 Y1:416 Y2:523
When it comes to the Doctor's
companion, the Torchwood
files are strangely lacking.

246
00:17:57,418 --> 00:18:02,770  X1:150 X2:569 Y1:416 Y2:523
It seems the evidence
has been corrupted,
something called Bad Wolf virus.

247
00:18:02,810 --> 00:18:04,967  X1:204 X2:515 Y1:452 Y2:523
At least we've got these
photographs.

248
00:18:05,007 --> 00:18:07,087  X1:168 X2:551 Y1:452 Y2:523
They're first-hand evidence...
Elton?

249
00:18:07,127 --> 00:18:10,921  X1:166 X2:551 Y1:452 Y2:523
Oh, it was a London accent,
definitely, she's from London.

250
00:18:10,961 --> 00:18:13,561  X1:220 X2:499 Y1:452 Y2:523
So we hit the streets.
We get out there.

251
00:18:13,601 --> 00:18:15,638  X1:122 X2:597 Y1:452 Y2:523
We take the photograph. Someone's
got to know who she is. Somewhere.

252
00:18:15,678 --> 00:18:21,392  X1:166 X2:551 Y1:416 Y2:523
Yes, but London's a big place.
I should know - my own
daughter's out there.

253
00:18:21,432 --> 00:18:23,589  X1:140 X2:579 Y1:488 Y2:523
Bridget, don't make this personal.

254
00:18:23,629 --> 00:18:29,943  X1:148 X2:571 Y1:416 Y2:523
I don't like to be touched literally
or metaphorically. I haven't got
the time.

255
00:18:29,983 --> 00:18:32,261  X1:216 X2:503 Y1:488 Y2:523
Find me that girl! Go!

256
00:18:32,301 --> 00:18:34,298  X1:274 X2:445 Y1:488 Y2:523
Now! Move!

257
00:18:34,338 --> 00:18:38,332  X1:218 X2:499 Y1:452 Y2:523
'And so it began.
The impossible task -

258
00:18:38,372 --> 00:18:40,729  X1:184 X2:533 Y1:488 Y2:523
'to scour the mean streets.

259
00:18:40,769 --> 00:18:43,729  X1:196 X2:523 Y1:452 Y2:523

city for an unknown girl.

260
00:18:43,769 --> 00:18:47,842  X1:130 X2:589 Y1:452 Y2:523
To hunt down that face in a seething
metropolis of lost souls,

261
00:18:47,882 --> 00:18:50,920  X1:230 X2:489 Y1:452 Y2:523

262
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:54,477  X1:194 X2:525 Y1:452 Y2:523
Oh, that's Rose Tyler,
she lives just down there,

263
00:18:54,517 --> 00:19:01,280  X1:176 X2:543 Y1:416 Y2:523

her mother's Jackie Tyler.
Nice family, bit odd.

264
00:19:04,385 --> 00:19:08,862  X1:210 X2:507 Y1:452 Y2:523
# Don't you know
it's a beautiful new day

265
00:19:08,902 --> 00:19:10,989  X1:214 X2:505 Y1:488 Y2:523
# Hey, hey, hey... #

266
00:19:12,659 --> 00:19:16,570  X1:236 X2:483 Y1:452 Y2:523
Oi! Jackie!
Hello, sweetheart!

267
00:19:16,610 --> 00:19:20,631  X1:120 X2:599 Y1:452 Y2:523
I'll see you down the Spinning Wheel
tonight, yeah? Pub quiz. Get 'em in!

268
00:19:27,961 --> 00:19:29,598  X1:200 X2:519 Y1:488 Y2:523
'I'd been trained for this.

'But how was I gonna do this?'

273
00:19:42,707 --> 00:19:47,787  X1:128 X2:589 Y1:452 Y2:523
'Scuse me, you couldn't give us quid

My name's Jackie, by the way.

277

Um! Elton. Oh, you don't
meet many Eltons, do you?

278
00:20:06,561 --> 00:20:09,467  X1:206 X2:513 Y1:488 Y2:523
Apart from the obvious.

I tell you what, Elton, here we are,
complete strangers
and I'm flashing you my knickers!

integrate yourself into the

Mind you, I'm only down here
cos my washing machine's knackered.

283
00:20:32,530 --> 00:20:35,888  X1:158 X2:561 Y1:452 Y2:523
I don't suppose you're any good
at fixing things, are you?

284
00:20:35,928 --> 00:20:39,605  X1:168 X2:551 Y1:488 Y2:523
There we are, it was the fuse!

285
00:20:39,645 --> 00:20:43,239  X1:148 X2:571 Y1:452 Y2:523
Nothing wrong with the machine,
that's fine, all working.

286
00:20:43,279 --> 00:20:46,239  X1:128 X2:589 Y1:488 Y2:523
Oh, Elton, I should have you on tap!

287
00:20:46,279 --> 00:20:50,832  X1:206 X2:513 Y1:416 Y2:523
I used to have this little
mate called Mickey,
he did all that stuff.

288
00:20:50,872 --> 00:20:53,190  X1:188 X2:531 Y1:488 Y2:523
He's gone now, bless him.

289
00:20:53,230 --> 00:20:56,987  X1:128 X2:589 Y1:452 Y2:523
Well, if you need me, give us a call,
I'll jot down my number.

290
00:20:57,027 --> 00:21:00,384  X1:168 X2:549 Y1:452 Y2:523
You do that, and I'll make us
a cup of tea, go and sit down.

291
00:21:00,424 --> 00:21:02,421  X1:180 X2:537 Y1:488 Y2:523
Put the telly on if you want,

292
00:21:02,461 --> 00:21:04,719  X1:228 X2:491 Y1:488 Y2:523
I can't bear it silent.

293
00:21:12,289 --> 00:21:15,406  X1:202 X2:517 Y1:452 Y2:523
It's just me, these days,
rattling about.

294
00:21:15,446 --> 00:21:18,083  X1:196 X2:523 Y1:452 Y2:523
There's my daughter,
but she's gone travelling.

295
00:21:18,123 --> 00:21:24,044  X1:124 X2:595 Y1:416 Y2:523
I keep her bedroom all nice and
ready though, just in case she comes
back. And her name is? Rose.

296
00:21:25,855 --> 00:21:28,376  X1:186 X2:531 Y1:488 Y2:523
That's a nice name - Rose.

297
00:21:28,416 --> 00:21:30,370  X1:180 X2:539 Y1:488 Y2:523
So, where is she travelling?

298
00:21:30,410 --> 00:21:35,886  X1:158 X2:559 Y1:416 Y2:523
All over. She's got her mobile,
I get a call, now and then.
Not as often as I'd like.

299
00:21:35,926 --> 00:21:39,697  X1:178 X2:541 Y1:452 Y2:523
Still - that age, who can
be bothered phoning home?

300
00:21:41,801 --> 00:21:45,157  X1:138 X2:581 Y1:452 Y2:523
Who's she with, is it mates, or...?
Just mates.

301
00:21:48,749 --> 00:21:53,826  X1:146 X2:573 Y1:416 Y2:523
Well, if I had you,
making a nice cuppa tea like this,
I wouldn't stray far from home.

302
00:21:53,866 --> 00:21:56,222  X1:242 X2:477 Y1:488 Y2:523
You're a charmer.

303
00:21:56,262 --> 00:21:58,315  X1:276 X2:443 Y1:488 Y2:523
Say it again!

304
00:22:00,818 --> 00:22:05,373  X1:140 X2:577 Y1:452 Y2:523
Magnificent! Oh, I could kiss you,
except I can't. The ex-ee-ma!

305
00:22:05,413 --> 00:22:07,971  X1:162 X2:555 Y1:452 Y2:523
I even got a picture of her
on my phone. That's amazing.

306
00:22:08,011 --> 00:22:10,611  X1:130 X2:589 Y1:452 Y2:523
You've achieved Steps 1-4 in precise
order, how did you manage it?

307
00:22:10,651 --> 00:22:14,125  X1:138 X2:581 Y1:452 Y2:523
Oh, I had to work hard. She keeps
everything very close to her chest.

308
00:22:14,165 --> 00:22:16,605  X1:192 X2:527 Y1:452 Y2:523
That's hell of a chest.
But how do you move on?

309
00:22:16,645 --> 00:22:19,036  X1:170 X2:549 Y1:452 Y2:523
Step five, that's the problem.
Step Five.

310
00:22:19,076 --> 00:22:22,913  X1:128 X2:589 Y1:452 Y2:523
This week's homework! I want a full
plan of attack from each of you!

311
00:22:22,953 --> 00:22:25,111  X1:212 X2:507 Y1:488 Y2:523
Now go on! Vamoose!

312
00:22:25,151 --> 00:22:27,472  X1:182 X2:537 Y1:488 Y2:523
Avanti! There's work to do!

313
00:22:27,512 --> 00:22:30,548  X1:180 X2:539 Y1:488 Y2:523
And Elton, keep infiltrating!

314
00:22:30,588 --> 00:22:35,821  X1:128 X2:591 Y1:452 Y2:523
You will do anything to get that
information, boy, anything! Yes, sir

315
00:22:35,861 --> 00:22:38,178  X1:238 X2:479 Y1:488 Y2:523
Oh, oh, Bridget...

316
00:22:38,218 --> 00:22:43,653  X1:144 X2:575 Y1:452 Y2:523
Bridget? Oh, yes. Could I have a
word with you in private? Um.

317
00:22:43,693 --> 00:22:46,051  X1:174 X2:543 Y1:488 Y2:523
Mr Skinner's giving me a lift.

318
00:22:46,091 --> 00:22:48,850  X1:152 X2:567 Y1:452 Y2:523
I can drop you to the station.
I'm sure Mr Skinner won't mind?

319
00:22:48,890 --> 00:22:51,087  X1:290 X2:429 Y1:488 Y2:523
Not at all.

320
00:22:51,127 --> 00:22:54,488  X1:158 X2:559 Y1:452 Y2:523
Bridget, I'll see you next week.
All right, then.

321
00:22:59,154 --> 00:23:00,678  X1:298 X2:421 Y1:488 Y2:523
Bye bye.

322
00:23:01,912 --> 00:23:03,592  X1:124 X2:595 Y1:488 Y2:523
Now Mr Skinner, I don't mean to pry.

323
00:23:03,632 --> 00:23:08,345  X1:162 X2:557 Y1:452 Y2:523
But did you give Bridget a little
kiss back there? I think I did.

324
00:23:08,385 --> 00:23:13,900  X1:128 X2:591 Y1:416 Y2:523
And, if you get your way, might
there be more little kisses between
the two of you? I think there might.

325
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:15,499  X1:194 X2:525 Y1:488 Y2:523
I knew it! That's brilliant.

326
00:23:15,539 --> 00:23:18,097  X1:144 X2:575 Y1:488 Y2:523
Now don't get excited. We'll see.

327
00:23:18,137 --> 00:23:20,964  X1:078 X2:479 Y1:488 Y2:523
WOMAN SCREAMS IN DISTANCE

328
00:23:23,811 --> 00:23:28,967  X1:164 X2:555 Y1:416 Y2:523
Infiltration went well,
cos Jackie kept phoning up,
needing this and needing that.

329
00:23:29,007 --> 00:23:35,679  X1:178 X2:541 Y1:416 Y2:523
It was strange, the amount
of things that needed doing,
it's like that flat was jinxed.

330
00:23:43,228 --> 00:23:46,186  X1:078 X2:545 Y1:452 Y2:523
ROMANTIC MUSIC PLAYS
It's weird, these fuses keep blowing.

331
00:23:46,226 --> 00:23:49,702  X1:152 X2:567 Y1:452 Y2:523
You must be near a sub-station,
cos then you get power surges.

332
00:23:49,742 --> 00:23:51,829  X1:200 X2:519 Y1:488 Y2:523
Still, there we go, fixed!

333
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:57,573  X1:182 X2:537 Y1:452 Y2:523
There we are. Little reward
for my favourite handyman.

334
00:23:57,613 --> 00:23:59,653  X1:188 X2:531 Y1:452 Y2:523
Oh, well I shouldn't really,
I've got the car outside.

335
00:23:59,693 --> 00:24:02,690  X1:130 X2:589 Y1:488 Y2:523
You can always splash out on a taxi,

336
00:24:02,730 --> 00:24:04,767  X1:262 X2:457 Y1:488 Y2:523
or...whatever.

337
00:24:04,807 --> 00:24:07,644  X1:236 X2:483 Y1:488 Y2:523
See what happens.

338
00:24:07,684 --> 00:24:10,762  X1:222 X2:497 Y1:488 Y2:523
Right, yeah. Cheers.

339
00:24:10,802 --> 00:24:12,366  X1:306 X2:413 Y1:488 Y2:523
Cheers!

340
00:24:15,076 --> 00:24:18,033  X1:158 X2:559 Y1:488 Y2:523
Very nice, what's that, French?

341
00:24:18,073 --> 00:24:23,547  X1:176 X2:543 Y1:452 Y2:523
Suppose so. They know how
to do things, the French.

342
00:24:23,587 --> 00:24:26,703  X1:196 X2:523 Y1:452 Y2:523
Is that from Rose?
I mean, is she in France?

343
00:24:26,743 --> 00:24:30,140  X1:140 X2:579 Y1:416 Y2:523
My daughter won't be coming back
tonight, just in case you're
wondering.

344
00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:32,817  X1:146 X2:571 Y1:488 Y2:523
We've got the place to ourselves.

345
00:24:32,857 --> 00:24:34,341  X1:314 X2:405 Y1:488 Y2:523
Right.

346
00:24:38,492 --> 00:24:40,209  X1:280 X2:439 Y1:488 Y2:523
Nice music.

347
00:24:40,249 --> 00:24:42,646  X1:264 X2:453 Y1:488 Y2:523
Il Divo. Yeah.

348
00:24:42,686 --> 00:24:45,206  X1:248 X2:471 Y1:488 Y2:523
You were saying.

349
00:24:45,246 --> 00:24:48,040  X1:178 X2:541 Y1:452 Y2:523
Power surges.
From the sub-station, yeah.

350
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:50,077  X1:144 X2:573 Y1:488 Y2:523
Is that why it gets so hot in here?

351
00:24:50,117 --> 00:24:53,475  X1:158 X2:561 Y1:452 Y2:523
Is it hot? Oh, I think so.
You should take your jacket off.

352
00:24:53,515 --> 00:24:56,671  X1:138 X2:579 Y1:452 Y2:523
No, I'm fine. Oh, look at you, you
must be boiling. Oh, your shirt!

353
00:24:56,711 --> 00:25:00,785  X1:148 X2:571 Y1:452 Y2:523
Sorry! No, I'm fine, it's all right.
I've ruined it.

354
00:25:00,825 --> 00:25:04,186  X1:176 X2:543 Y1:452 Y2:523
No, honestly, it's fine. Take
it off, I'll put it in the wash.

355
00:25:04,226 --> 00:25:06,313  X1:134 X2:585 Y1:488 Y2:523
Oh, come on, it's only a little drop.

356
00:25:08,182 --> 00:25:09,576  X1:284 X2:435 Y1:488 Y2:523
There now.

357
00:25:09,616 --> 00:25:12,377  X1:304 X2:415 Y1:488 Y2:523
Ruined.

358
00:25:12,417 --> 00:25:14,253  X1:252 X2:467 Y1:488 Y2:523
And there I was.

359
00:25:14,293 --> 00:25:16,730  X1:208 X2:509 Y1:488 Y2:523
The ultimate Step Five!

360
00:25:16,770 --> 00:25:18,807  X1:210 X2:509 Y1:488 Y2:523
The perfect infiltration.

361
00:25:18,847 --> 00:25:20,527  X1:296 X2:423 Y1:488 Y2:523
Target...

362
00:25:20,567 --> 00:25:22,051  X1:278 X2:441 Y1:488 Y2:523
Jackie Tyler.

363
00:25:24,605 --> 00:25:28,316  X1:182 X2:537 Y1:452 Y2:523
You're right - it is a bit hot!
But it's about to get hotter!

364
00:25:28,356 --> 00:25:30,233  X1:246 X2:471 Y1:488 Y2:523
I'll see you soon.

365
00:25:30,273 --> 00:25:33,191  X1:190 X2:527 Y1:488 Y2:523
All right, be careful. Bye.

366
00:25:35,189 --> 00:25:37,707  X1:228 X2:491 Y1:488 Y2:523
Everything all right?

367
00:25:37,747 --> 00:25:39,345  X1:212 X2:507 Y1:488 Y2:523
That was my daughter.

368
00:25:41,146 --> 00:25:44,461  X1:184 X2:535 Y1:488 Y2:523
Oh, look at you. I'm sorry.

369
00:25:44,501 --> 00:25:46,457  X1:210 X2:509 Y1:488 Y2:523
I was just being stupid.

370
00:25:46,497 --> 00:25:48,495  X1:286 X2:433 Y1:488 Y2:523
Is she OK?

371
00:25:48,535 --> 00:25:50,775  X1:242 X2:477 Y1:488 Y2:523
She's so far away.

372
00:25:50,815 --> 00:25:53,932  X1:178 X2:539 Y1:488 Y2:523
I get left here sometimes...

373
00:25:53,972 --> 00:25:56,889  X1:166 X2:553 Y1:488 Y2:523
and I don't know where she is.

374
00:25:56,929 --> 00:25:59,566  X1:180 X2:537 Y1:452 Y2:523
Anything could be
happening to her, anything.

375
00:25:59,606 --> 00:26:02,148  X1:208 X2:511 Y1:488 Y2:523
And I just go a bit mad.

376
00:26:03,798 --> 00:26:06,835  X1:214 X2:505 Y1:488 Y2:523
Put your shirt back on.

377
00:26:10,311 --> 00:26:12,309  X1:264 X2:455 Y1:488 Y2:523
Where is she?

378
00:26:12,349 --> 00:26:14,588  X1:254 X2:463 Y1:488 Y2:523
Doesn't matter.

379
00:26:14,628 --> 00:26:16,505  X1:292 X2:427 Y1:488 Y2:523
I'm sorry.

380
00:26:16,545 --> 00:26:18,598  X1:252 X2:467 Y1:488 Y2:523
You'd better go.

381
00:26:23,539 --> 00:26:25,059  X1:286 X2:431 Y1:488 Y2:523
Actually...

382
00:26:25,099 --> 00:26:28,453  X1:168 X2:551 Y1:488 Y2:523
'And that's when it struck me.

383
00:26:28,493 --> 00:26:31,571  X1:158 X2:559 Y1:452 Y2:523
'Funny, the things you think of,
with your shirt off.

384
00:26:31,611 --> 00:26:35,608  X1:184 X2:533 Y1:452 Y2:523
'But that's when I realised
what was really important.'

385
00:26:35,648 --> 00:26:37,604  X1:204 X2:515 Y1:488 Y2:523
Never mind about Rose.

386
00:26:37,644 --> 00:26:39,759  X1:204 X2:515 Y1:488 Y2:523
I'm not even gonna ask.

387
00:26:39,799 --> 00:26:45,194  X1:160 X2:557 Y1:416 Y2:523
And I will put my shirt back on,
because I am gonna go out
and get us both a pizza.

388
00:26:45,234 --> 00:26:50,229  X1:138 X2:581 Y1:416 Y2:523
Cos I reckon you need cheering up.
She goes swanning off and who's
left to care about you, eh?

389
00:26:50,269 --> 00:26:53,747  X1:134 X2:585 Y1:452 Y2:523
So I say, nice bit of pizza,
we'll put the telly on nice and loud,

390
00:26:53,787 --> 00:26:58,861  X1:138 X2:579 Y1:416 Y2:523
we'll annoy that woman next door,
just you and me, as proper mates.
Yeah?

391
00:26:58,901 --> 00:27:02,018  X1:260 X2:459 Y1:488 Y2:523
Mates! Go on,

392
00:27:02,058 --> 00:27:03,896  X1:282 X2:437 Y1:488 Y2:523
say, "Yes."

393
00:27:03,936 --> 00:27:05,830  X1:324 X2:395 Y1:488 Y2:523
Yes!

394
00:27:08,092 --> 00:27:11,770  X1:184 X2:535 Y1:452 Y2:523
All of a sudden,
a lot of things made sense.

395
00:27:11,810 --> 00:27:17,841  X1:172 X2:547 Y1:416 Y2:523
I'd got so lost in conspiracies
and aliens and targets,
I'd been missing the obvious.

396
00:27:17,881 --> 00:27:19,557  X1:230 X2:489 Y1:488 Y2:523
Cos I did like Jackie.

397
00:27:19,597 --> 00:27:22,219  X1:230 X2:489 Y1:452 Y2:523
But I liked someone
else even more.

398
00:27:24,675 --> 00:27:27,072  X1:164 X2:555 Y1:488 Y2:523
# Hey you with the pretty face

399
00:27:27,112 --> 00:27:30,346  X1:164 X2:555 Y1:488 Y2:523
# Welcome to the human race

400
00:27:30,386 --> 00:27:34,582  X1:166 X2:553 Y1:452 Y2:523
# A celebration
Mr Blue Sky's up there waiting

401
00:27:34,622 --> 00:27:38,460  X1:190 X2:529 Y1:452 Y2:523
# And today
is the day we've waited for

402
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:40,977  X1:278 X2:441 Y1:488 Y2:523
# Oh ho-ho

403
00:27:41,017 --> 00:27:43,605  X1:126 X2:593 Y1:488 Y2:523
# Mr Blue Sky, please tell us why...

404
00:27:46,611 --> 00:27:48,568  X1:170 X2:549 Y1:488 Y2:523
Right. Let's get inside, then.

405
00:27:48,608 --> 00:27:50,928  X1:204 X2:515 Y1:488 Y2:523
The pizza's getting cold.

406
00:27:50,968 --> 00:27:53,761  X1:234 X2:485 Y1:488 Y2:523
I went in your coat.

407
00:27:53,801 --> 00:27:55,839  X1:232 X2:485 Y1:452 Y2:523
For once in my life,
I thought, I'll pay.

408
00:27:55,879 --> 00:27:58,917  X1:154 X2:565 Y1:452 Y2:523
I thought, he's such a nice man,
he won't accept anything

409
00:27:58,957 --> 00:28:03,594  X1:170 X2:549 Y1:452 Y2:523
so I'll just slip a tenner in his
pocket and look what I found.

410
00:28:03,634 --> 00:28:05,631  X1:168 X2:551 Y1:488 Y2:523
A photograph of my daughter.

411
00:28:05,671 --> 00:28:09,385  X1:168 X2:551 Y1:452 Y2:523
No, no, no. It's not like that.
I can explain. I bet you can.

412
00:28:09,425 --> 00:28:12,625  X1:152 X2:567 Y1:452 Y2:523
I wasn't being pervy or anything,
I wasn't after her.

413
00:28:12,665 --> 00:28:14,222  X1:178 X2:541 Y1:488 Y2:523
I was looking for the Doctor.

414
00:28:14,262 --> 00:28:19,216  X1:134 X2:585 Y1:452 Y2:523
Oh, I know that. I worked that out.
Cos it's never me, is it?

415
00:28:19,256 --> 00:28:21,573  X1:196 X2:523 Y1:452 Y2:523
No, that's how it started,
but I changed my mind.

416
00:28:21,613 --> 00:28:25,689  X1:152 X2:567 Y1:452 Y2:523
Let me tell you something
about those who get left behind.

417
00:28:25,729 --> 00:28:29,724  X1:134 X2:585 Y1:452 Y2:523
Because it's hard
and that's what you become. Hard.

418
00:28:29,764 --> 00:28:35,279  X1:148 X2:571 Y1:416 Y2:523
But if there's
one thing I've learnt,
it's that I will never let her down.

419
00:28:35,319 --> 00:28:38,555  X1:188 X2:531 Y1:452 Y2:523
So whatever you want,
I'm warning you. Back off.

420
00:28:42,789 --> 00:28:46,306  X1:136 X2:583 Y1:452 Y2:523
But Jackie, I only wanted to
meet him. I thought you liked me.

421
00:28:46,346 --> 00:28:49,183  X1:192 X2:527 Y1:488 Y2:523
I do. Just get out of here!

422
00:28:49,223 --> 00:28:52,023  X1:266 X2:453 Y1:488 Y2:523
I said get out!

423
00:28:52,063 --> 00:28:53,058  X1:226 X2:493 Y1:488 Y2:523
And leave me alone!

424
00:28:59,575 --> 00:29:02,171  X1:126 X2:593 Y1:452 Y2:523
And she was right.
It's shameful. We used that woman!

425
00:29:02,211 --> 00:29:07,203  X1:158 X2:561 Y1:416 Y2:523
I knew I couldn't trust you!
You broke cover, you stupid
little man, you failed Step Five.

426
00:29:07,243 --> 00:29:08,683  X1:180 X2:539 Y1:488 Y2:523
I don't care about Step Five!

427
00:29:08,723 --> 00:29:12,494  X1:126 X2:593 Y1:452 Y2:523
Cos it's all gone wrong, Mr Kennedy,
ever since you turned up.

428
00:29:14,157 --> 00:29:18,354  X1:136 X2:583 Y1:452 Y2:523
We used to come here, every week
and we'd have a laugh.

429
00:29:18,394 --> 00:29:20,235  X1:248 X2:471 Y1:488 Y2:523
We were friends.

430
00:29:20,275 --> 00:29:25,145  X1:124 X2:595 Y1:416 Y2:523
No wonder they stopped coming,
I mean there's no Bliss any more and
even Bridget, she hasn't turned up.

431
00:29:25,185 --> 00:29:28,702  X1:116 X2:603 Y1:452 Y2:523
I've been phoning and phoning,
there's no reply. Who can blame her?

432
00:29:28,742 --> 00:29:32,300  X1:206 X2:511 Y1:452 Y2:523
I'm sorry, Victor,
but you're on your own.

433
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:35,256  X1:182 X2:537 Y1:452 Y2:523
Cos I'm leaving,
and so are you, Mr Skinner.

434
00:29:35,296 --> 00:29:39,013  X1:210 X2:509 Y1:452 Y2:523
And as for you, Ursula,
you're coming with me

435
00:29:39,053 --> 00:29:42,647  X1:126 X2:593 Y1:452 Y2:523
and we're going to the Golden Locust
and we're gonna have a Chinese!

436
00:29:42,687 --> 00:29:46,600  X1:160 X2:557 Y1:452 Y2:523
What's that got to do with it?
I mean, you and me, together.

437
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:49,159  X1:260 X2:459 Y1:488 Y2:523
Having a meal.

438
00:29:49,199 --> 00:29:51,741  X1:280 X2:439 Y1:488 Y2:523
If you want.

439
00:29:53,956 --> 00:29:55,552  X1:262 X2:457 Y1:488 Y2:523
Oh, I'd love it!

440
00:29:55,592 --> 00:29:59,350  X1:122 X2:597 Y1:452 Y2:523
But you can't leave.
You'll never know what he was doing.

441
00:29:59,390 --> 00:30:03,424  X1:128 X2:591 Y1:452 Y2:523
You'll never know what he was doing
in your house, all those years ago.

442
00:30:03,464 --> 00:30:06,871  X1:230 X2:489 Y1:488 Y2:523
No, I'll never know.

443
00:30:09,181 --> 00:30:11,177  X1:304 X2:415 Y1:488 Y2:523
Ursula?

444
00:30:11,217 --> 00:30:12,775  X1:262 X2:455 Y1:488 Y2:523
Get your stuff.

445
00:30:12,815 --> 00:30:15,855  X1:174 X2:545 Y1:488 Y2:523
Mr Skinner, are you coming?

446
00:30:15,895 --> 00:30:19,368  X1:160 X2:559 Y1:452 Y2:523
Not to the Chinese, if you don't
mind, just sort of walking out.

447
00:30:19,408 --> 00:30:23,403  X1:198 X2:521 Y1:488 Y2:523
I certainly am! Victor....

448
00:30:23,443 --> 00:30:25,043  X1:286 X2:431 Y1:488 Y2:523
Good luck.

449
00:30:25,083 --> 00:30:27,360  X1:294 X2:425 Y1:488 Y2:523
Goodbye.

450
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:28,960  X1:276 X2:441 Y1:488 Y2:523
Mr Skinner?

451
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,954  X1:218 X2:501 Y1:452 Y2:523
W-would you stay
for a minute, please?

452
00:30:31,994 --> 00:30:33,471  X1:238 X2:481 Y1:488 Y2:523
We're walking out.

453
00:30:33,511 --> 00:30:35,031  X1:174 X2:545 Y1:488 Y2:523
I've got numbers for Bridget.

454
00:30:35,071 --> 00:30:39,868  X1:130 X2:589 Y1:416 Y2:523
I've kept records. I've got old
numbers. We could track her down.
Together, you and I.

455
00:30:39,908 --> 00:30:43,266  X1:232 X2:485 Y1:452 Y2:523
That's more like
the old team spirit.

456
00:30:43,306 --> 00:30:45,980  X1:194 X2:525 Y1:452 Y2:523
You two have a nice time.
I hope you find her.

457
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:48,299  X1:260 X2:459 Y1:488 Y2:523
I'll e-mail you.

458
00:30:48,339 --> 00:30:51,211  X1:202 X2:517 Y1:488 Y2:523
Just come a little closer.

459
00:30:54,171 --> 00:30:57,251  X1:078 X2:529 Y1:452 Y2:523
Mm! Yeah, I love prawns.
DISTANT SCREAM

460
00:30:57,291 --> 00:30:59,924  X1:226 X2:493 Y1:488 Y2:523
Oh, I left my phone.

461
00:30:59,964 --> 00:31:03,042  X1:124 X2:595 Y1:488 Y2:523
Really? Yeah. It's not in my pocket.

462
00:31:03,082 --> 00:31:05,158  X1:200 X2:519 Y1:488 Y2:523
So much for the big exit.

463
00:31:05,198 --> 00:31:07,331  X1:204 X2:513 Y1:488 Y2:523
Yeah. C'mon, hurry up.

464
00:31:13,673 --> 00:31:15,827  X1:148 X2:571 Y1:488 Y2:523
I'm not stopping, I just left my...

465
00:31:15,867 --> 00:31:17,987  X1:308 X2:409 Y1:488 Y2:523
phone.

466
00:31:18,027 --> 00:31:20,979  X1:148 X2:571 Y1:488 Y2:523
Victor? Take your phone and go.

467
00:31:22,183 --> 00:31:24,141  X1:224 X2:495 Y1:488 Y2:523
Where's Mr Skinner?

468
00:31:24,181 --> 00:31:27,057  X1:208 X2:509 Y1:488 Y2:523
He's gone to the toilet.

469
00:31:27,097 --> 00:31:32,092  X1:130 X2:589 Y1:452 Y2:523
But we haven't got toilets. We have
to use the pub on the corner.

470
00:31:32,132 --> 00:31:34,570  X1:164 X2:555 Y1:488 Y2:523
Well, that's where he is, then.

471
00:31:34,610 --> 00:31:36,094  X1:294 X2:423 Y1:488 Y2:523
Help me!

472
00:31:38,083 --> 00:31:42,120  X1:136 X2:581 Y1:452 Y2:523
What was that? It was nothing.
It was nothing! Help me! Get out.

473
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:45,197  X1:240 X2:479 Y1:488 Y2:523
That's Mr Skinner.

474
00:31:45,237 --> 00:31:47,904  X1:188 X2:531 Y1:488 Y2:523
Victor, look at your hands.

475
00:31:49,751 --> 00:31:52,909  X1:210 X2:509 Y1:488 Y2:523
Look at the rest of me!

476
00:31:52,949 --> 00:31:55,026  X1:184 X2:535 Y1:488 Y2:523
You've dabbled with aliens.

477
00:31:55,066 --> 00:31:58,146  X1:166 X2:553 Y1:488 Y2:523
Now meet the genuine article!

478
00:31:58,186 --> 00:32:01,979  X1:198 X2:519 Y1:488 Y2:523
Oh, my God! You're a...

479
00:32:02,019 --> 00:32:04,737  X1:254 X2:463 Y1:488 Y2:523
thing. A thing?

480
00:32:04,777 --> 00:32:07,454  X1:188 X2:531 Y1:488 Y2:523
This thing is my true form.

481
00:32:07,494 --> 00:32:11,451  X1:186 X2:533 Y1:452 Y2:523
Better than that crude
pink shape you call a body.

482
00:32:11,491 --> 00:32:13,645  X1:162 X2:557 Y1:488 Y2:523
What happened? Where am I?

483
00:32:13,685 --> 00:32:16,522  X1:230 X2:489 Y1:488 Y2:523
Ursula, is that you?

484
00:32:16,562 --> 00:32:18,799  X1:240 X2:479 Y1:488 Y2:523
That's Mr Skinner.

485
00:32:18,839 --> 00:32:23,075  X1:176 X2:543 Y1:452 Y2:523
What have you done to him?
I've absorbed him.

486
00:32:23,115 --> 00:32:26,033  X1:078 X2:409 Y1:452 Y2:523
Colin? Is that you?
Colin? Bridget, my love?

487
00:32:26,073 --> 00:32:28,470  X1:180 X2:539 Y1:488 Y2:523
Oh, my God, that's Bridget!

488
00:32:28,510 --> 00:32:30,747  X1:156 X2:561 Y1:452 Y2:523
Colin, where are you?
I'm here, Bridget. It's all right.

489
00:32:30,787 --> 00:32:32,787  X1:292 X2:427 Y1:488 Y2:523
I'm close.

490
00:32:32,827 --> 00:32:34,824  X1:178 X2:541 Y1:488 Y2:523
You've absorbed them both.

491
00:32:34,864 --> 00:32:37,862  X1:144 X2:573 Y1:488 Y2:523
What about Bliss? Where is she?

492
00:32:37,902 --> 00:32:40,178  X1:078 X2:407 Y1:452 Y2:523
MUFFLED YELP
What?

493
00:32:40,218 --> 00:32:44,055  X1:148 X2:571 Y1:452 Y2:523
I said you really don't want
to know. You've absorbed them.

494
00:32:44,095 --> 00:32:46,653  X1:214 X2:503 Y1:488 Y2:523
You're some sort of...

495
00:32:46,693 --> 00:32:50,447  X1:164 X2:555 Y1:488 Y2:523
Absorbathon. An Absorbaling.

496
00:32:50,487 --> 00:32:52,643  X1:256 X2:461 Y1:488 Y2:523
An Abzorbaloff!

497
00:32:52,683 --> 00:32:55,281  X1:164 X2:553 Y1:488 Y2:523
Yes. I like that. Let them go.

498
00:32:55,321 --> 00:32:57,081  X1:246 X2:473 Y1:488 Y2:523
I'm ordering you.

499
00:32:57,121 --> 00:32:58,957  X1:224 X2:493 Y1:488 Y2:523
Let those people go!

500
00:32:58,997 --> 00:33:01,115  X1:202 X2:517 Y1:488 Y2:523
But they taste so sweet.

501
00:33:01,155 --> 00:33:03,235  X1:182 X2:535 Y1:488 Y2:523
Just think about the Doctor.

502
00:33:03,275 --> 00:33:05,991  X1:210 X2:507 Y1:488 Y2:523
Oh, how will HE taste?

503
00:33:06,031 --> 00:33:08,709  X1:230 X2:489 Y1:452 Y2:523
All that experience,
all that knowledge.

504
00:33:08,749 --> 00:33:12,503  X1:146 X2:573 Y1:452 Y2:523
And if I've got to absorb Jackie
Tyler to get to him, then so be it.

505
00:33:12,543 --> 00:33:15,302  X1:258 X2:461 Y1:488 Y2:523
Don't you dare!

506
00:33:15,342 --> 00:33:18,620  X1:138 X2:581 Y1:488 Y2:523
If I have to beat them out of you...

507
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:20,538  X1:176 X2:543 Y1:488 Y2:523
No, no, please don't hit me!

508
00:33:20,578 --> 00:33:24,292  X1:142 X2:575 Y1:452 Y2:523
Look at me!
I'm such a slow and clumsy beast.

509
00:33:24,332 --> 00:33:26,226  X1:228 X2:491 Y1:488 Y2:523
Please don't hit me.

510
00:33:28,645 --> 00:33:31,002  X1:180 X2:539 Y1:488 Y2:523
Well, then, give them back.

511
00:33:31,042 --> 00:33:34,039  X1:184 X2:535 Y1:488 Y2:523
What, you mean like this?!

512
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:39,026  X1:140 X2:577 Y1:488 Y2:523
Just one touch! That's all it takes!

513
00:33:44,552 --> 00:33:46,152  X1:298 X2:419 Y1:488 Y2:523
No! No!

514
00:33:46,192 --> 00:33:49,269  X1:144 X2:575 Y1:488 Y2:523
Leave her alone! Don't touch me.

515
00:33:50,785 --> 00:33:54,419  X1:202 X2:517 Y1:452 Y2:523
Oh, Elton. I'm so sorry.
You can't touch me.

516
00:33:54,459 --> 00:33:56,499  X1:308 X2:411 Y1:488 Y2:523
Ursula!

517
00:33:56,539 --> 00:33:59,056  X1:142 X2:577 Y1:488 Y2:523
"Most likely to fight back" indeed!

518
00:33:59,096 --> 00:34:00,739  X1:250 X2:469 Y1:488 Y2:523
Leave her alone!

519
00:34:15,598 --> 00:34:18,226  X1:196 X2:523 Y1:488 Y2:523
Yes! No! That's not fair!

520
00:34:19,672 --> 00:34:21,389  X1:208 X2:511 Y1:488 Y2:523
She tastes like chicken.

521
00:34:21,429 --> 00:34:24,308  X1:216 X2:503 Y1:488 Y2:523
Elton, where are you?

522
00:34:24,348 --> 00:34:26,269  X1:306 X2:413 Y1:488 Y2:523
Please.

523
00:34:26,309 --> 00:34:29,223  X1:224 X2:495 Y1:488 Y2:523
Mr Kennedy, please.

524
00:34:29,263 --> 00:34:30,863  X1:258 X2:461 Y1:488 Y2:523
I'm asking you.

525
00:34:30,903 --> 00:34:33,821  X1:248 X2:469 Y1:488 Y2:523
I'm begging you.

526
00:34:33,861 --> 00:34:36,738  X1:174 X2:545 Y1:488 Y2:523
Give her back to me. I can't.

527
00:34:36,778 --> 00:34:41,007  X1:174 X2:545 Y1:452 Y2:523
Once they've been absorbed,
the process is irreversible.

528
00:34:41,047 --> 00:34:42,765  X1:262 X2:457 Y1:488 Y2:523
Wait a minute.

529
00:34:42,805 --> 00:34:45,726  X1:200 X2:519 Y1:452 Y2:523
Now I've been absorbed,
I can read his thoughts!

530
00:34:45,766 --> 00:34:48,642  X1:274 X2:445 Y1:488 Y2:523
Oh, my God.

531
00:34:48,682 --> 00:34:52,040  X1:130 X2:589 Y1:488 Y2:523
Elton, you're next! Get out of here!

532
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:56,513  X1:172 X2:545 Y1:452 Y2:523
Now you've seen him,
he can't let you go. Just run!

533
00:34:56,553 --> 00:34:59,710  X1:150 X2:569 Y1:488 Y2:523
Go on! Never mind me, get out!

534
00:34:59,750 --> 00:35:02,788  X1:122 X2:597 Y1:488 Y2:523
Isn't she the clever one? Run, Elton!

535
00:35:02,828 --> 00:35:06,349  X1:078 X2:525 Y1:452 Y2:523
RUN! Save yourself, boy!
Run for your life!

536
00:35:29,318 --> 00:35:31,038  X1:208 X2:511 Y1:488 Y2:523
Oh, what's the matter?

537
00:35:31,078 --> 00:35:32,796  X1:180 X2:537 Y1:488 Y2:523
Have you given up so soon?

538
00:35:32,836 --> 00:35:34,952  X1:248 X2:471 Y1:488 Y2:523
There's no point.

539
00:35:34,992 --> 00:35:37,909  X1:236 X2:481 Y1:488 Y2:523
Where would I go?

540
00:35:37,949 --> 00:35:39,547  X1:184 X2:533 Y1:488 Y2:523
Everything I ever wanted...

541
00:35:39,587 --> 00:35:43,703  X1:190 X2:529 Y1:452 Y2:523
Has been absorbed.
Oh, Elton. Don't say that.

542
00:35:43,743 --> 00:35:45,301  X1:274 X2:445 Y1:488 Y2:523
But it's true!

543
00:35:45,341 --> 00:35:48,622  X1:150 X2:569 Y1:488 Y2:523
Then join us. Join us, little man.

544
00:35:48,662 --> 00:35:53,214  X1:124 X2:595 Y1:452 Y2:523
Come on. There's everlasting peace.
Come on, join us -

545
00:35:53,254 --> 00:35:55,671  X1:246 X2:473 Y1:488 Y2:523
dissolve into me.

546
00:35:59,289 --> 00:36:02,190  X1:078 X2:287 Y1:488 Y2:523
TARDIS WHIRRS

547
00:36:16,749 --> 00:36:19,616  X1:150 X2:569 Y1:488 Y2:523
Someone wants a word with you.

548
00:36:21,422 --> 00:36:22,901  X1:210 X2:509 Y1:488 Y2:523
You've upset my mum.

549
00:36:24,022 --> 00:36:29,936  X1:166 X2:553 Y1:416 Y2:523
A great big absorbing creature
from outer space,
and you're having a go at me?

550
00:36:29,976 --> 00:36:31,850  X1:144 X2:575 Y1:488 Y2:523
No-one upsets my mum. At last.

551
00:36:31,890 --> 00:36:35,567  X1:194 X2:525 Y1:452 Y2:523
The greatest feast of all -
the Doctor. Interesting.

552
00:36:35,607 --> 00:36:38,444  X1:194 X2:525 Y1:488 Y2:523
Some sort of Absorbatrix.

553
00:36:38,484 --> 00:36:41,082  X1:180 X2:539 Y1:488 Y2:523
Absorbaklon, Abzorbaloff...

554
00:36:41,122 --> 00:36:45,119  X1:156 X2:563 Y1:452 Y2:523
Abzorbaloff, yes.
Is it me, or is he a bit Slitheen?

555
00:36:45,159 --> 00:36:47,635  X1:146 X2:571 Y1:452 Y2:523
Not from
Raxacoricofallapatorius, are you?

556
00:36:47,675 --> 00:36:49,432  X1:180 X2:539 Y1:488 Y2:523
No, I'm not! They're swine.

557
00:36:49,472 --> 00:36:52,070  X1:160 X2:559 Y1:452 Y2:523
I spit on them.
I was born on their twin planet.

558
00:36:52,110 --> 00:36:56,306  X1:142 X2:577 Y1:452 Y2:523
Really? What's the twin planet
of Raxacoricofallapatorius? Clom.

559
00:36:56,346 --> 00:37:02,221  X1:146 X2:573 Y1:416 Y2:523
Clom? Clom, yes. And I'll return
there victorious, once I possess
your travelling machine.

560
00:37:02,261 --> 00:37:04,938  X1:148 X2:571 Y1:452 Y2:523
Well, that's never gonna happen.
Oh, it will.

561
00:37:04,978 --> 00:37:09,572  X1:156 X2:563 Y1:452 Y2:523
You'll surrender yourself to me,
Doctor, or this one dies.

562
00:37:09,612 --> 00:37:11,172  X1:170 X2:547 Y1:452 Y2:523
You see, I've read about you,
Doctor.

563
00:37:11,212 --> 00:37:14,046  X1:152 X2:567 Y1:488 Y2:523
I've studied you. So passionate.

564
00:37:14,086 --> 00:37:17,604  X1:184 X2:535 Y1:452 Y2:523
So sweet. You wouldn't let
an innocent man die.

565
00:37:17,644 --> 00:37:22,678  X1:160 X2:559 Y1:452 Y2:523
And I'll absorb him
unless you give yourself to me.

566
00:37:24,715 --> 00:37:26,914  X1:258 X2:459 Y1:488 Y2:523
Sweet, maybe.

567
00:37:26,954 --> 00:37:29,991  X1:154 X2:565 Y1:452 Y2:523
Passionate, I suppose. But
don't ever mistake that for nice.

568
00:37:30,031 --> 00:37:33,677  X1:238 X2:479 Y1:488 Y2:523
Do what you want.

569
00:37:35,307 --> 00:37:38,014  X1:160 X2:559 Y1:488 Y2:523
He'll die, Doctor! Go on, then.

570
00:37:40,180 --> 00:37:45,777  X1:112 X2:607 Y1:452 Y2:523
So be it. Mind you, the others
might have something to say. Others?

571
00:37:45,817 --> 00:37:48,971  X1:166 X2:553 Y1:452 Y2:523
He's right! The Doctor's right!
We can't let him.

572
00:37:49,011 --> 00:37:53,604  X1:166 X2:553 Y1:488 Y2:523
Oh, Mr Skinner, Bridget, pull.

573
00:37:53,644 --> 00:37:58,079  X1:160 X2:559 Y1:452 Y2:523
No! For God's sake, pull,
if it's the last thing we ever do!

574
00:37:58,119 --> 00:38:01,316  X1:184 X2:533 Y1:488 Y2:523
Bliss! All of us, together -

575
00:38:01,356 --> 00:38:03,273  X1:258 X2:461 Y1:488 Y2:523
come on! Pull!

576
00:38:03,313 --> 00:38:06,313  X1:266 X2:451 Y1:488 Y2:523
LINDA united!

577
00:38:06,353 --> 00:38:08,281  X1:266 X2:451 Y1:488 Y2:523
PU-U-U-ULL!

578
00:38:12,068 --> 00:38:15,621  X1:186 X2:533 Y1:488 Y2:523
Elton! The cane! Break it!

579
00:38:15,661 --> 00:38:17,141  X1:296 X2:423 Y1:488 Y2:523
My cane!

580
00:38:17,181 --> 00:38:19,339  X1:266 X2:451 Y1:488 Y2:523
Y'stupid man!

581
00:38:19,379 --> 00:38:22,081  X1:304 X2:415 Y1:488 Y2:523
Oh, no!

582
00:38:27,368 --> 00:38:32,123  X1:138 X2:581 Y1:452 Y2:523
What did I do?
The cane created a limitation field.

583
00:38:32,163 --> 00:38:34,481  X1:162 X2:555 Y1:488 Y2:523
Now it's broken, he can't stop.

584
00:38:34,521 --> 00:38:38,247  X1:156 X2:563 Y1:452 Y2:523
The absorber is being absorbed.
By what?

585
00:38:39,915 --> 00:38:42,167  X1:272 X2:447 Y1:488 Y2:523
By the Earth.

586
00:38:48,269 --> 00:38:50,726  X1:254 X2:465 Y1:488 Y2:523
Bye-bye, Elton.

587
00:38:51,706 --> 00:38:53,230  X1:294 X2:423 Y1:488 Y2:523
Bye-bye.

588
00:39:01,014 --> 00:39:03,232  X1:264 X2:455 Y1:488 Y2:523
Who was she?

589
00:39:05,288 --> 00:39:06,937  X1:250 X2:469 Y1:488 Y2:523
That was Ursula.

590
00:39:23,311 --> 00:39:26,267  X1:272 X2:447 Y1:488 Y2:523
And that's it.

591
00:39:26,307 --> 00:39:27,987  X1:302 X2:415 Y1:488 Y2:523
Almost.

592
00:39:28,027 --> 00:39:30,705  X1:220 X2:497 Y1:452 Y2:523
Because the Doctor
still had more to say.

593
00:39:30,745 --> 00:39:34,457  X1:166 X2:553 Y1:452 Y2:523
You don't remember, do you?
And then he explained.

594
00:39:34,497 --> 00:39:38,413  X1:148 X2:571 Y1:488 Y2:523
That night, all those years ago...

595
00:39:38,453 --> 00:39:41,155  X1:138 X2:581 Y1:488 Y2:523
There was a shadow in your house.

596
00:39:42,647 --> 00:39:45,287  X1:154 X2:565 Y1:488 Y2:523
A living shadow in the darkness.

597
00:39:45,327 --> 00:39:49,084  X1:152 X2:565 Y1:452 Y2:523
An elemental shade had
escaped from the Howling Halls.

598
00:39:49,124 --> 00:39:51,801  X1:236 X2:483 Y1:488 Y2:523
I stopped it, but...

599
00:39:51,841 --> 00:39:54,133  X1:180 X2:539 Y1:488 Y2:523
I wasn't in time to save her.

600
00:39:56,074 --> 00:39:58,087  X1:292 X2:427 Y1:488 Y2:523
I'm sorry.

601
00:40:03,548 --> 00:40:06,711  X1:186 X2:531 Y1:452 Y2:523
Because that was the night
my mother died.

602
00:40:46,462 --> 00:40:48,919  X1:176 X2:541 Y1:488 Y2:523
We forget because we must.

603
00:40:55,132 --> 00:40:58,167  X1:244 X2:475 Y1:488 Y2:523
So, there you go.

604
00:40:58,207 --> 00:41:03,564  X1:158 X2:561 Y1:416 Y2:523
Turns out I've had
the most terrible things happen
and the most brilliant things,

605
00:41:03,604 --> 00:41:07,241  X1:190 X2:529 Y1:452 Y2:523
and sometimes, well,
I can't tell the difference -

606
00:41:07,281 --> 00:41:10,995  X1:188 X2:531 Y1:452 Y2:523
they're all the same thing,
they're just me.

607
00:41:11,035 --> 00:41:14,673  X1:202 X2:515 Y1:452 Y2:523
You know, Stephen King
said once, he said,

608
00:41:14,713 --> 00:41:18,347  X1:196 X2:523 Y1:452 Y2:523
"Salvation and damnation
are the same thing,"

609
00:41:18,387 --> 00:41:21,626  X1:148 X2:571 Y1:488 Y2:523
and I never knew what he meant.

610
00:41:21,666 --> 00:41:24,583  X1:258 X2:459 Y1:488 Y2:523
But I do now...

611
00:41:24,623 --> 00:41:28,574  X1:164 X2:553 Y1:452 Y2:523
Cos the Doctor might be
wonderful, but, thinking back,

612
00:41:28,614 --> 00:41:31,371  X1:152 X2:567 Y1:488 Y2:523
I was having such a special time.

613
00:41:31,411 --> 00:41:35,089  X1:194 X2:523 Y1:452 Y2:523
Just for a bit,
I had this nice little gang.

614
00:41:35,129 --> 00:41:38,166  X1:166 X2:551 Y1:452 Y2:523
# I'll tell you once more,
before I get off the floor... #

615
00:41:38,206 --> 00:41:41,123  X1:194 X2:525 Y1:488 Y2:523
And they were destroyed.

616
00:41:41,163 --> 00:41:43,881  X1:250 X2:469 Y1:488 Y2:523
It's not his fault,

617
00:41:43,921 --> 00:41:47,557  X1:160 X2:557 Y1:452 Y2:523
but maybe that's what happens
if you touch the Doctor,

618
00:41:47,597 --> 00:41:49,855  X1:238 X2:479 Y1:488 Y2:523
even for a second.

619
00:41:51,352 --> 00:41:54,151  X1:146 X2:573 Y1:488 Y2:523
I keep thinking of Rose and Jackie

620
00:41:54,191 --> 00:41:57,188  X1:190 X2:529 Y1:452 Y2:523
and how much longer
before they pay the price?

621
00:41:57,228 --> 00:41:59,665  X1:152 X2:567 Y1:488 Y2:523
Oh, now don't get all miserable.

622
00:41:59,705 --> 00:42:02,222  X1:128 X2:591 Y1:488 Y2:523
Come on, Elton, you've still got me.

623
00:42:02,262 --> 00:42:04,179  X1:290 X2:429 Y1:488 Y2:523
Oh, yeah,

624
00:42:04,219 --> 00:42:09,333  X1:136 X2:583 Y1:452 Y2:523
cos the Doctor said he could do
one last thing with his magic wand.

625
00:42:09,373 --> 00:42:13,846  X1:192 X2:527 Y1:416 Y2:523
If I can key into the
absorption matrix and
separate the last victim...

626
00:42:13,886 --> 00:42:16,804  X1:218 X2:501 Y1:452 Y2:523
It's too late for total
reconstruction, but...

627
00:42:18,762 --> 00:42:21,761  X1:218 X2:501 Y1:488 Y2:523
Elton! Fetch a spade!

628
00:42:21,801 --> 00:42:25,039  X1:198 X2:519 Y1:488 Y2:523
Even then, after all that,

629
00:42:25,079 --> 00:42:27,542  X1:136 X2:583 Y1:488 Y2:523
the Doctor saved me one last time.

630
00:42:34,586 --> 00:42:37,064  X1:172 X2:547 Y1:488 Y2:523
Here she is. Could be worse.

631
00:42:37,104 --> 00:42:38,743  X1:216 X2:503 Y1:488 Y2:523
At least I'll never age.

632
00:42:38,783 --> 00:42:42,255  X1:168 X2:551 Y1:452 Y2:523
And it really is quite peaceful.
You'd be surprised.

633
00:42:42,295 --> 00:42:45,615  X1:178 X2:541 Y1:488 Y2:523
It's a relationship. Of sorts.

634
00:42:45,655 --> 00:42:48,212  X1:274 X2:443 Y1:488 Y2:523
We manage.

635
00:42:48,252 --> 00:42:50,209  X1:142 X2:577 Y1:488 Y2:523
We've even got a bit of a love life.

636
00:42:50,249 --> 00:42:51,807  X1:194 X2:525 Y1:488 Y2:523
Oh, let's not go into that.

637
00:42:51,847 --> 00:42:56,842  X1:122 X2:595 Y1:452 Y2:523
And I don't care what anyone thinks -
I love her.

638
00:42:56,882 --> 00:42:59,379  X1:316 X2:403 Y1:488 Y2:523
Aaah!

639
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:03,357  X1:242 X2:477 Y1:488 Y2:523
But the thing is...

640
00:43:03,397 --> 00:43:05,157  X1:278 X2:441 Y1:488 Y2:523
There y'are.

641
00:43:05,197 --> 00:43:07,045  X1:148 X2:569 Y1:488 Y2:523
I've even bought a remote zoom.

642
00:43:08,872 --> 00:43:11,090  X1:170 X2:547 Y1:488 Y2:523
But what I wanted to say is...

643
00:43:12,586 --> 00:43:14,545  X1:176 X2:541 Y1:488 Y2:523
..y'know, when you're a kid,

644
00:43:14,585 --> 00:43:20,016  X1:130 X2:589 Y1:452 Y2:523
they tell you it's all "grow up,
get a job, get married, get a house,

645
00:43:20,056 --> 00:43:22,553  X1:196 X2:523 Y1:488 Y2:523
"have a kid and that's it".

646
00:43:24,054 --> 00:43:26,530  X1:330 X2:389 Y1:488 Y2:523
No.

647
00:43:26,570 --> 00:43:29,977  X1:170 X2:549 Y1:452 Y2:523
But the truth is, the world is
so much stranger than that...

648
00:43:31,444 --> 00:43:33,842  X1:204 X2:515 Y1:488 Y2:523
..and so much darker...

649
00:43:33,882 --> 00:43:35,890  X1:218 X2:499 Y1:488 Y2:523
and so much madder.

650
00:43:38,559 --> 00:43:41,505  X1:224 X2:495 Y1:488 Y2:523
And SO much better.

652
00:43:46,271 --> 00:43:49,672  X1:170 X2:549 Y1:380 Y2:415
30th Olympiad! That's great!

653
00:43:51,584 --> 00:43:56,217  X1:216 X2:501 Y1:416 Y2:523
They're not safe!
They're in the garden!
I'm begging you!

654
00:43:56,257 --> 00:43:59,698  X1:158 X2:559 Y1:452 Y2:523
In the last six days, three of
your children have been stolen.

655
00:44:01,452 --> 00:44:04,730  X1:228 X2:491 Y1:452 Y2:523
If we find the source
of that power...

656
00:44:04,770 --> 00:44:06,807  X1:130 X2:589 Y1:488 Y2:523
They're kids' pictures. Now get out!

657
00:44:06,847 --> 00:44:10,403  X1:158 X2:559 Y1:452 Y2:523
Chloe has a power. She's using
it to snatch the kids. Get out.

658
00:44:10,443 --> 00:44:13,201  X1:216 X2:503 Y1:452 Y2:523
If living things
can become drawings,

659
00:44:13,241 --> 00:44:16,477  X1:196 X2:523 Y1:452 Y2:523
then maybe drawings
can become living things.

660
00:44:17,533 --> 00:44:27,532  X1:124 X2:595 Y1:488 Y2:523
