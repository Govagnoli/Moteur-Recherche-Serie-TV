4
00:00:52,678 --> 00:00:54,139
Not now, I'm busy!

5
00:00:55,891 --> 00:00:57,158
And now, what?

6
00:00:57,356 --> 00:00:58,591
ALERT
TELEPORT BREACH

7
00:00:58,839 --> 00:00:59,456
What?

8
00:00:59,974 --> 00:01:00,864
What?

9
00:01:03,988 --> 00:01:07,453
Oi! Get out of my TARDIS!
I let down the defenses for one second!

10
00:01:07,802 --> 00:01:08,898
I must speak to the Doctor!

11
00:01:09,146 --> 00:01:10,885
I don't care, you're a Graske,

12
00:01:10,985 --> 00:01:12,731
and a Graske is trouble.
Out!

13
00:01:13,906 --> 00:01:14,981
But that noise...

14
00:01:15,236 --> 00:01:17,039
Beautiful sound in the air,
what is it?

15
00:01:20,626 --> 00:01:24,613
If you must know,
it's the music of the Spheres.

16
00:01:24,803 --> 00:01:26,791
Music of the Spheres is what?

17
00:01:26,891 --> 00:01:27,362
Well...

18
00:01:27,792 --> 00:01:30,265
You've got all these planets
revolving around suns,

19
00:01:30,451 --> 00:01:32,788
and all those suns revolving
around in galaxies,

20
00:01:33,410 --> 00:01:35,726
and all those galaxies
revolving around each other.

21
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:39,508
If you take the gravity patterns and
feed them to the TARDIS harmonic filter,

22
00:01:39,608 --> 00:01:40,341
that,

23
00:01:40,635 --> 00:01:41,676
Mr. Graske...

24
00:01:42,775 --> 00:01:44,614
is the sound of the Universe.

25
00:01:47,682 --> 00:01:49,579
The Universe sounds wonderful.

26
00:01:50,265 --> 00:01:51,186
Yeah...

27
00:01:52,147 --> 00:01:53,291
It does, doesn't it?

28
00:01:54,731 --> 00:01:57,526
- But you're still not staying!
- No, Graske came to warn you.

29
00:01:57,788 --> 00:01:58,348
About what?

30
00:01:58,448 --> 00:01:59,284
About that!

31
00:02:01,561 --> 00:02:03,407
Oh! Now...

32
00:02:04,476 --> 00:02:06,185
That looks like a space portal.

33
00:02:06,405 --> 00:02:07,504
Told you!
Danger!

34
00:02:07,635 --> 00:02:09,206
Nah, it's harmless.

35
00:02:10,046 --> 00:02:11,328
It's just a hole in space.

36
00:02:13,014 --> 00:02:14,873
I wonder what's on the other side.

37
00:02:19,934 --> 00:02:20,654
Hello?

38
00:02:22,544 --> 00:02:23,645
What is that, then?

39
00:02:25,831 --> 00:02:27,297
Who are all those people?

40
00:02:28,932 --> 00:02:29,855
Hold on!

41
00:02:31,773 --> 00:02:33,633
That looks like...
Is that the Albert Hall?

42
00:02:35,567 --> 00:02:37,150
I said 'is that the Albert Hall?'

43
00:02:39,275 --> 00:02:42,145
I said 'is that the Albert Hall?'

44
00:02:43,381 --> 00:02:44,964
Oh! Brilliant!
Hello!

45
00:02:46,183 --> 00:02:47,461
I said 'hello!'

46
00:02:49,204 --> 00:02:54,172
No, no, no, sorry, you'll have to shout.
I said 'hello!'

47
00:02:56,325 --> 00:03:00,032
Listen, I'm the Doctor, I'm a Time Lord,
but that is an awful lot of people!

48
00:03:00,784 --> 00:03:02,318
What are you all doing there?
Oh!

49
00:03:03,689 --> 00:03:07,444
Wait a minute, it's the Proms! Is that
the Proms? Are you in the Proms?

50
00:03:08,424 --> 00:03:11,221
Oh! I love the Proms!
I was in the very first Proms,

51
00:03:11,321 --> 00:03:13,459
1895, I played the tuba,
I was brilliant.

52
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:16,055
Is that the orchestra down there?

53
00:03:16,327 --> 00:03:17,672
Oh! Wait a minute!

54
00:03:21,723 --> 00:03:26,304
'Cause, funny thing is, I've just been
composing something myself.

55
00:03:27,155 --> 00:03:30,196
I said to Beethoven I could rattle off
a tune, he said 'pardon'... But!

56
00:03:30,412 --> 00:03:33,870
I've just been inspired
by the Music of the Spheres.

57
00:03:34,655 --> 00:03:36,070
I've written my own symphony.

58
00:03:36,365 --> 00:03:36,876
Yeah.

59
00:03:37,314 --> 00:03:40,119
And if I can send these pages
through the portal

60
00:03:40,281 --> 00:03:42,552
then the orchestra can play it.

61
00:03:43,371 --> 00:03:44,692
A brand new piece of music.

62
00:03:45,435 --> 00:03:46,598
Composed by me.

63
00:03:47,477 --> 00:03:48,813
Ready for this, orchestra?

64
00:03:48,965 --> 00:03:49,789
Stand by!

65
00:03:50,132 --> 00:03:52,595
Three... Two... One...

66
00:03:56,188 --> 00:03:57,120
That's it, that's it.

67
00:03:59,335 --> 00:04:00,584
There you go, hurry up!

68
00:04:01,898 --> 00:04:04,389
This portal isn't gonna stay open
for long, right!

69
00:04:05,086 --> 00:04:05,535
Now!

70
00:04:05,747 --> 00:04:09,398
So! Er, if you don't mind,
Mr. conductor...

71
00:04:10,192 --> 00:04:11,040
Stand out.

72
00:04:12,227 --> 00:04:13,312
I'm in charge of this one.

73
00:04:13,596 --> 00:04:18,238
Quiet please! Shhht!
Silence, settle down.

74
00:04:18,551 --> 00:04:19,825
Oi! Settle down.

75
00:04:20,454 --> 00:04:21,064
So!

76
00:04:21,929 --> 00:04:23,765
Ladies and Gentlemen...
and children,

77
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:30,068
This is the world-wide premiere
of 'Ode to the Universe'.

78
00:04:31,395 --> 00:04:32,322
And...

79
00:04:44,809 --> 00:04:47,770
Oh, come on, that was brilliant!

80
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:54,397
Thank you... I thank you... No, no,
I thank you, really, you're too kind.

81
00:04:54,939 --> 00:04:57,783
Ah! You see, Graske, that's the thing
about Planet Earth.

82
00:04:58,704 --> 00:04:59,228
What?

83
00:04:59,663 --> 00:05:01,884
What? Where's he gone?

84
00:05:03,577 --> 00:05:04,052
No!

85
00:05:06,002 --> 00:05:06,976
I've lost a Graske.

86
00:05:07,398 --> 00:05:08,818
He must have slipped
through the portal.

87
00:05:08,938 --> 00:05:09,658
Have you seen him?

88
00:05:10,641 --> 00:05:11,350
Oh!

89
00:05:12,016 --> 00:05:12,846
There he is!

90
00:05:13,567 --> 00:05:15,839
Albert Hall, you've got
a Graske on the loose.

91
00:05:19,723 --> 00:05:21,503
And he's stolen my waterpistol!

92
00:05:22,907 --> 00:05:24,500
Oi! Graske!

93
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:26,157
Stop it, behave!

94
00:05:27,063 --> 00:05:29,497
He wasn't trying to warn me, he was
trying to find a shortcut to Earth!

95
00:05:29,597 --> 00:05:31,914
If he escapes, he'll run
the whole planet, causing troubles...

96
00:05:32,127 --> 00:05:33,267
stealing sweets...

97
00:05:33,948 --> 00:05:35,018
making smells...

98
00:05:35,409 --> 00:05:36,558
Hold on! Hold on! Hold on!

99
00:05:37,054 --> 00:05:39,269
I'm just gonna reverse
the polarity of the neutron flow

100
00:05:39,369 --> 00:05:41,854
and pull that Graske
back into the TARDIS!

101
00:05:43,444 --> 00:05:44,382
It's not fair!

102
00:05:45,042 --> 00:05:46,060
I'll give you not fair!

103
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:48,044
I'm gonna reverse the teleport
and send you

104
00:05:48,144 --> 00:05:49,909
all the way to the other side
of the galaxy!

105
00:05:55,274 --> 00:05:55,794
Good!

106
00:05:57,472 --> 00:05:59,118
Well, that was fun.

107
00:05:59,848 --> 00:06:00,813
And a little bit mad!

108
00:06:00,913 --> 00:06:03,196
But I've got to close this portal
if I don't want anymore trouble.

109
00:06:03,296 --> 00:06:04,355
It's nice to see you all.

110
00:06:04,806 --> 00:06:06,180
But, one more thing...

111
00:06:07,221 --> 00:06:08,150
Just remember...

112
00:06:08,923 --> 00:06:11,462
Music isn't just orchestras
and popstars

113
00:06:11,677 --> 00:06:14,349
and a bunch of people with albums
and downloads and concerts...

114
00:06:15,191 --> 00:06:16,193
It's you.

115
00:06:17,464 --> 00:06:20,573
'Cause the music of the Spheres
is all around you.

116
00:06:23,289 --> 00:06:24,383
When you're on your own,

117
00:06:24,685 --> 00:06:27,033
just close your eyes
and you'll hear it.

118
00:06:28,179 --> 00:06:29,037
Music.

119
00:06:29,335 --> 00:06:30,392
Inside your head.

120
00:06:31,491 --> 00:06:33,087
'Cause everyone's a musician.

121
00:06:33,523 --> 00:06:35,061
Everyone's got a song inside them.

122
00:06:36,576 --> 00:06:37,824
Every single one of you.

123
00:06:39,434 --> 00:06:40,043
Bye.

129
