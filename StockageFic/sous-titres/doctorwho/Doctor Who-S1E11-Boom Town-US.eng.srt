1
00:00:05,008 --> 00:00:07,704  X1:170 X2:549 Y1:452 Y2:523
There's still no word
from inside Downing Street. . .

2
00:00:11,485 --> 00:00:14,147  X1:204 X2:515 Y1:452 Y2:523
 .though we are getting
even more new arrivals.

3
00:00:17,517 --> 00:00:19,388  X1:226 X2:493 Y1:488 Y2:523
We are the Slitheen.

4
00:00:19,428 --> 00:00:22,946  X1:148 X2:571 Y1:452 Y2:523
Reduce the Earth to molten slag,
then sell it.

5
00:00:22,986 --> 00:00:24,994  X1:150 X2:569 Y1:488 Y2:523
Leave this planet or I'll stop you.

6
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:29,618  X1:188 X2:531 Y1:488 Y2:523
The world is in your hands.

7
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:50,037  X1:136 X2:581 Y1:452 Y2:523
I've checked the figures,
I've checked them again and again.

8
00:00:50,077 --> 00:00:52,598  X1:204 X2:515 Y1:488 Y2:523
Always the same result.

9
00:00:52,638 --> 00:00:57,748  X1:160 X2:559 Y1:452 Y2:523
The design is not safe. It could
result in the death of millions.

10
00:00:57,788 --> 00:01:02,945  X1:140 X2:577 Y1:452 Y2:523
I beg of you, stop the project right
now before it's too late.

11
00:01:02,985 --> 00:01:05,607  X1:222 X2:497 Y1:488 Y2:523
Well. . .goodness me.

12
00:01:07,261 --> 00:01:10,536  X1:212 X2:507 Y1:452 Y2:523
Obviously, Mr Cleaver,
you're the expert.

13
00:01:10,576 --> 00:01:13,448  X1:234 X2:485 Y1:488 Y2:523
Then you'll stop it?

14
00:01:13,488 --> 00:01:15,487  X1:192 X2:527 Y1:488 Y2:523
It seems I have no choice.

15
00:01:15,527 --> 00:01:18,962  X1:078 X2:219 Y1:488 Y2:523
GURGLING

16
00:01:19,002 --> 00:01:22,041  X1:220 X2:499 Y1:488 Y2:523
Oh. . . Do excuse me.

17
00:01:22,081 --> 00:01:24,798  X1:194 X2:525 Y1:452 Y2:523
Civic duties leave
little time for a sandwich.

18
00:01:24,838 --> 00:01:27,035  X1:230 X2:489 Y1:452 Y2:523
But you promise
you'll stop it today?

19
00:01:27,075 --> 00:01:28,834  X1:254 X2:465 Y1:488 Y2:523
Well, of course.

20
00:01:28,874 --> 00:01:33,389  X1:186 X2:533 Y1:452 Y2:523
Nothing is more
important than human life.

21
00:01:33,429 --> 00:01:36,705  X1:196 X2:523 Y1:452 Y2:523
What do you take me for,
some sort of maniac?

22
00:01:36,745 --> 00:01:38,623  X1:296 X2:423 Y1:488 Y2:523
Why, no.

23
00:01:38,663 --> 00:01:42,463  X1:158 X2:561 Y1:452 Y2:523
Am I right in thinking you've
shown your results only to me?

24
00:01:42,503 --> 00:01:44,340  X1:196 X2:521 Y1:488 Y2:523
Just to you, no-one else.

25
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:46,381  X1:280 X2:439 Y1:488 Y2:523
Wise move.

26
00:01:46,421 --> 00:01:48,854  X1:144 X2:575 Y1:488 Y2:523
This is such a weight off my mind.

27
00:01:48,894 --> 00:01:52,088  X1:134 X2:583 Y1:452 Y2:523
I've barely slept.
I couldn't believe my own readings.

28
00:01:52,128 --> 00:01:54,365  X1:250 X2:469 Y1:488 Y2:523
The scale of it. . .

29
00:01:54,405 --> 00:01:58,085  X1:156 X2:563 Y1:452 Y2:523
Destruction like the British Isles
has never seen before.

30
00:01:58,125 --> 00:02:03,639  X1:120 X2:599 Y1:416 Y2:523
If I didn't know better,
I'd almost think that someone wanted
this project to go wrong,

31
00:02:03,679 --> 00:02:09,273  X1:152 X2:567 Y1:452 Y2:523
as though they intended this city
should be wiped off the map.

32
00:02:09,313 --> 00:02:13,209  X1:160 X2:559 Y1:452 Y2:523
Thank goodness we've got you,
our esteemed leader.

33
00:03:28,987 --> 00:03:31,983  X1:112 X2:605 Y1:452 Y2:523
Who the hell are you?
What do you mean, who the hell am I?

34
00:03:32,023 --> 00:03:36,738  X1:136 X2:583 Y1:452 Y2:523
Who the hell are you? Captain Jack
Harkness. Get out of my way!

35
00:03:36,778 --> 00:03:38,616  X1:134 X2:585 Y1:488 Y2:523
Don't tell me, this must be Mickey.

36
00:03:38,656 --> 00:03:42,292  X1:142 X2:575 Y1:452 Y2:523
Here comes trouble! How are you
doing, Ricky boy? It's Mickey!

37
00:03:42,332 --> 00:03:46,609  X1:132 X2:585 Y1:452 Y2:523
Don't listen to him, he's
winding you up. You look fantastic.

38
00:03:46,649 --> 00:03:52,961  X1:116 X2:603 Y1:416 Y2:523
Aw, sweet! How come I never get any
of that? Buy me a drink first.
You're such hard work. But worth it!

39
00:03:53,001 --> 00:03:54,757  X1:190 X2:529 Y1:488 Y2:523
Did you manage to find it?

40
00:03:54,797 --> 00:03:57,235  X1:116 X2:603 Y1:488 Y2:523
There you go. I can go anywhere now!

41
00:03:57,275 --> 00:04:03,389  X1:140 X2:577 Y1:416 Y2:523
You don't need a passport. It's all
very well going to Platform One
in Justicia and the Glass Pyramid,

42
00:04:03,429 --> 00:04:07,824  X1:132 X2:585 Y1:416 Y2:523
but what if we end up in Brazil?
I might need it.
You see, I'm prepared for anything.

43
00:04:07,864 --> 00:04:10,247  X1:138 X2:581 Y1:488 Y2:523
It sounds like you're staying, then.

44
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:18,489  X1:118 X2:599 Y1:452 Y2:523
So what are you doing in Cardiff? And
who the hell's Jumping Jack Flash?

45
00:04:18,529 --> 00:04:22,612  X1:124 X2:595 Y1:452 Y2:523
I don't mind you hanging out with Big
Ears there. . . Oi! Look in the mirror.

46
00:04:22,652 --> 00:04:26,522  X1:162 X2:557 Y1:452 Y2:523
 .but this guy, he's kinda. . .
Handsome? More like cheesy.

47
00:04:26,562 --> 00:04:30,363  X1:152 X2:567 Y1:452 Y2:523
Early 21st-century slang,
is cheesy good or bad? It's bad.

48
00:04:30,403 --> 00:04:32,439  X1:220 X2:499 Y1:452 Y2:523
But bad means good,
isn't that right?

49
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:36,273  X1:112 X2:607 Y1:452 Y2:523
Are you saying I'm not handsome? We
just stopped off, we need to refuel.

50
00:04:36,313 --> 00:04:39,113  X1:194 X2:525 Y1:452 Y2:523
Cardiff's got a rift through
the middle of the city.

51
00:04:39,153 --> 00:04:45,464  X1:152 X2:567 Y1:416 Y2:523
It's like an earthquake fault
between different dimensions.
The rift was healed back in 1869.

52
00:04:45,504 --> 00:04:50,101  X1:142 X2:577 Y1:452 Y2:523
Thanks to a girl named Gwyneth.
She saved the world and closed it.

53
00:04:50,141 --> 00:04:54,815  X1:156 X2:563 Y1:416 Y2:523
But closing a rift leaves a scar,
and that scar generates energy,
harmless to the human race. . .

54
00:04:54,855 --> 00:05:00,805  X1:144 X2:573 Y1:416 Y2:523
But perfect for the Tardis. I park
on top of the scar. . . Open up the
engines, soak up the radiation. . .

55
00:05:00,845 --> 00:05:04,609  X1:144 X2:575 Y1:452 Y2:523
Like filling her up with petrol, and
off we go! Into time! And space!

56
00:05:04,649 --> 00:05:09,922  X1:132 X2:587 Y1:416 Y2:523
My God, have you seen yourselves?
You all think you're so clever,
don't you? Yep. Yeah! Yup.

57
00:05:11,118 --> 00:05:14,314  X1:186 X2:531 Y1:452 Y2:523
It'll take another 24 hours,
so we've got time to kill.

58
00:05:14,354 --> 00:05:19,349  X1:124 X2:593 Y1:416 Y2:523
That old lady's staring.
Probably wondering what four people
can do inside a small wooden box.

59
00:05:19,389 --> 00:05:22,261  X1:196 X2:521 Y1:452 Y2:523
What are you captain of -
the Innuendo Squad?

60
00:05:24,343 --> 00:05:27,263  X1:212 X2:505 Y1:452 Y2:523
Wait, er, the Tardis,
doesn't it get noticed?

61
00:05:27,303 --> 00:05:30,300  X1:150 X2:569 Y1:452 Y2:523
Yeah, why does it look like that?
It's a cloaking device.

62
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:35,448  X1:162 X2:557 Y1:416 Y2:523
It's called a chameleon circuit.
The Tardis is meant to disguise
itself wherever it lands.

63
00:05:35,488 --> 00:05:41,723  X1:146 X2:573 Y1:416 Y2:523
I landed in the 1960s,
it disguised itself as a police box,
and the circuit got stuck.

64
00:05:41,763 --> 00:05:43,842  X1:150 X2:569 Y1:488 Y2:523
There actually was police boxes?

65
00:05:43,882 --> 00:05:51,473  X1:122 X2:595 Y1:416 Y2:523
Yeah. Before they had radios, they'd
phone for help. If they arrested
someone, they could put 'em inside.

66
00:05:51,513 --> 00:05:54,790  X1:146 X2:571 Y1:452 Y2:523
Why don't you just fix the circuit?
I like it, don't you? I love it.

67
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:58,553  X1:142 X2:577 Y1:452 Y2:523
There's no police boxes any more,
so doesn't it get noticed?

68
00:05:58,593 --> 00:06:05,381  X1:126 X2:593 Y1:416 Y2:523
Ricky, you put a mysterious blue box
slap bang in the middle of town,
what do people do? Walk past it.

69
00:06:05,421 --> 00:06:08,377  X1:206 X2:513 Y1:452 Y2:523
Now stop your nagging,
let's go and explore.

70
00:06:08,417 --> 00:06:11,529  X1:160 X2:559 Y1:452 Y2:523
What's the plan? I don't know.
Cardiff, early 21st century,

71
00:06:11,569 --> 00:06:16,126  X1:152 X2:565 Y1:416 Y2:523
and the wind's coming
from the. . .east. Trust me.
The safest place in the universe.

72
00:06:16,166 --> 00:06:21,655  X1:160 X2:559 Y1:416 Y2:523
This nuclear power station right
in the heart of Cardiff city
will bring jobs for all!

73
00:06:22,601 --> 00:06:29,235  X1:160 X2:559 Y1:416 Y2:523
As you can see, as Lord Mayor,
I've had to sanction some
radical redevelopments.

74
00:06:29,275 --> 00:06:32,272  X1:146 X2:571 Y1:488 Y2:523
No photographs! What did I say?

75
00:06:32,312 --> 00:06:36,586  X1:148 X2:571 Y1:452 Y2:523
Take pictures of the project by all
means, but not me, thank you.

76
00:06:36,626 --> 00:06:38,703  X1:320 X2:399 Y1:488 Y2:523
So. . .

77
00:06:38,743 --> 00:06:44,897  X1:146 X2:571 Y1:416 Y2:523
Cardiff Castle will be demolished,
allowing the Blaidd Drwg Project
to rise up, tall and proud,

78
00:06:44,937 --> 00:06:47,614  X1:158 X2:561 Y1:488 Y2:523
a monument to Welsh industry.

79
00:06:47,654 --> 00:06:50,171  X1:128 X2:591 Y1:488 Y2:523
And, yes, some of you might shiver.

80
00:06:50,211 --> 00:06:52,048  X1:142 X2:577 Y1:488 Y2:523
The words "nuclear power station"

81
00:06:52,088 --> 00:06:56,325  X1:128 X2:591 Y1:452 Y2:523
and "major population centre" aren't
exactly the happiest of bedfellows.

82
00:06:56,365 --> 00:06:59,043  X1:212 X2:507 Y1:452 Y2:523
But I give you
my personal guarantee

83
00:06:59,083 --> 00:07:05,396  X1:184 X2:535 Y1:416 Y2:523
that as long as I walk upon
this Earth, no harm will
come to any of my citizens.

84
00:07:05,436 --> 00:07:08,191  X1:204 X2:515 Y1:488 Y2:523
Now drink up, a toast. . .

85
00:07:08,231 --> 00:07:10,790  X1:190 X2:529 Y1:488 Y2:523
To the future! The future!

86
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:13,426  X1:240 X2:479 Y1:488 Y2:523
And believe me. . .

87
00:07:13,466 --> 00:07:14,984  X1:280 X2:439 Y1:488 Y2:523
it will glow.

88
00:07:19,579 --> 00:07:26,012  X1:136 X2:583 Y1:416 Y2:523
Excuse me, my name's Cathy Salt,
I represent the Cardiff Gazette.
I'm sorry, I'm not doing interviews.

89
00:07:26,052 --> 00:07:27,569  X1:156 X2:563 Y1:488 Y2:523
But are you aware of the curse?

90
00:07:27,609 --> 00:07:31,246  X1:202 X2:515 Y1:452 Y2:523
Whatever do you mean?
Cathy, wasn't it?

91
00:07:31,286 --> 00:07:37,079  X1:140 X2:579 Y1:416 Y2:523
Some of your engineers are saying
that the Blaidd Drwg Project is
cursed. Sounds rather silly to me.

92
00:07:37,119 --> 00:07:39,677  X1:216 X2:501 Y1:488 Y2:523
That's what I thought,

93
00:07:39,717 --> 00:07:43,354  X1:218 X2:501 Y1:452 Y2:523
but the funny thing is
it does look a bit odd.

94
00:07:43,394 --> 00:07:47,631  X1:130 X2:589 Y1:452 Y2:523
In what way? The number of deaths
associated with this project -

95
00:07:47,671 --> 00:07:50,749  X1:182 X2:537 Y1:452 Y2:523
the entire team of
European safety inspectors.

96
00:07:50,789 --> 00:07:55,021  X1:182 X2:537 Y1:416 Y2:523
They were French,
and, "Danger! Explosives!"
was only written in Welsh.

97
00:07:55,061 --> 00:08:01,172  X1:118 X2:601 Y1:416 Y2:523
And the accident with the Cardiff
Heritage Committee. The electrocutio
of that swimming pool was accidental.

98
00:08:01,212 --> 00:08:02,651  X1:210 X2:507 Y1:488 Y2:523
And then the architect.

99
00:08:02,691 --> 00:08:06,926  X1:148 X2:571 Y1:452 Y2:523
It was raining, visibility was
low, my car simply couldn't stop.

100
00:08:06,966 --> 00:08:12,881  X1:122 X2:597 Y1:416 Y2:523
And then recently Mr Cleaver, the
government's nuclear adviser. Slippe
on an icy patch. He was decapitated.

101
00:08:12,921 --> 00:08:20,074  X1:126 X2:593 Y1:416 Y2:523
It was a very icy patch. These
stories are nothing more than typical
small-town thinking. Excuse me.

102
00:08:20,114 --> 00:08:24,990  X1:126 X2:593 Y1:452 Y2:523
Before he died, Mr Cleaver posted
some of his findings online. Did he?

103
00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:28,947  X1:128 X2:591 Y1:452 Y2:523
He was concerned about the reactor.
Oh! All that technical stuff.

104
00:08:28,987 --> 00:08:33,301  X1:146 X2:573 Y1:416 Y2:523
Specifically that the design of
the suppression pool would cause
the hydrogen recombiners to fail,

105
00:08:33,341 --> 00:08:38,892  X1:100 X2:619 Y1:416 Y2:523
precipitating the collapse of the
containment system, causing
meltdown. You've done your homework.

106
00:08:38,932 --> 00:08:40,212  X1:264 X2:453 Y1:488 Y2:523
That's my job.

107
00:08:40,252 --> 00:08:42,840  X1:220 X2:499 Y1:488 Y2:523
I think. . .Cathy Salt. . .

108
00:08:44,409 --> 00:08:47,723  X1:198 X2:521 Y1:452 Y2:523
 .I think you and I should
have a word in private.

109
00:08:47,763 --> 00:08:50,523  X1:078 X2:219 Y1:488 Y2:523
GURGLING

110
00:08:50,563 --> 00:08:56,635  X1:134 X2:585 Y1:416 Y2:523
Oh, my little tummy's complaining.
We might have to make a detour
to the ladies. I'll wait here.

111
00:08:56,675 --> 00:08:59,634  X1:150 X2:569 Y1:488 Y2:523
Oh, come on! All girls together!

112
00:08:59,674 --> 00:09:04,424  X1:136 X2:583 Y1:452 Y2:523
So you were saying?
These outlandish theories of yours.

113
00:09:06,345 --> 00:09:08,625  X1:078 X2:219 Y1:488 Y2:523
GURGLING

114
00:09:08,665 --> 00:09:14,973  X1:142 X2:577 Y1:416 Y2:523
It sounds like we got here just
in time. Continue. Well, I don't
know much about nuclear physics,

115
00:09:15,013 --> 00:09:22,288  X1:128 X2:591 Y1:416 Y2:523
but from what I could make out,
Cleaver was saying the whole project
could go up, worse than Chernobyl.

116
00:09:22,328 --> 00:09:25,485  X1:196 X2:523 Y1:452 Y2:523
Is there something wrong
with the lights?

117
00:09:25,525 --> 00:09:30,879  X1:156 X2:563 Y1:416 Y2:523
Oh, they're always on the blink.
I can't tell you how
many memos I've sent.

118
00:09:30,919 --> 00:09:32,956  X1:252 X2:467 Y1:488 Y2:523
So. . .Chernobyl?

119
00:09:32,996 --> 00:09:35,516  X1:176 X2:541 Y1:452 Y2:523
Apparently,
but a thousand times worse.

120
00:09:35,556 --> 00:09:39,313  X1:128 X2:591 Y1:452 Y2:523
I mean it sounds absurd, there must
be so many safety regulations,

121
00:09:39,353 --> 00:09:45,224  X1:126 X2:591 Y1:416 Y2:523
but Cleaver seemed to be talking
about a nuclear holocaust.
He almost made it sound deliberate.

122
00:09:45,264 --> 00:09:51,655  X1:118 X2:601 Y1:416 Y2:523
We're hardly The Sunday Times, we're
only the Cardiff Gazette, but we do
have a duty to report the facts.

123
00:09:51,695 --> 00:09:58,369  X1:158 X2:561 Y1:416 Y2:523
And you're going to print this
information? Are you all right?
You sound a bit. . . Sore throat.

124
00:09:58,409 --> 00:10:01,687  X1:194 X2:525 Y1:488 Y2:523
Ahem. Just a little tickle.

125
00:10:01,727 --> 00:10:07,057  X1:136 X2:583 Y1:452 Y2:523
But tell me, do you intend to make
this information public? I have to.

126
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,877  X1:300 X2:419 Y1:488 Y2:523
So be it.

127
00:10:10,917 --> 00:10:16,191  X1:144 X2:575 Y1:416 Y2:523
Mind you,
my boyfriend thinks I'm mad.
We're getting married next month

128
00:10:16,231 --> 00:10:20,108  X1:156 X2:563 Y1:452 Y2:523
and he says I could lose my job,
just when we need the money.

129
00:10:20,148 --> 00:10:23,586  X1:138 X2:581 Y1:488 Y2:523
Boyfriend? Jeffrey, civil servant. . .

130
00:10:23,626 --> 00:10:27,975  X1:124 X2:595 Y1:452 Y2:523
He's nothing exciting,
but he's mine. When's the wedding?

131
00:10:28,015 --> 00:10:33,709  X1:156 X2:561 Y1:416 Y2:523
The 19th. It's really just to stop
my mother from nagging,
but the baby sort of clinched it.

132
00:10:35,291 --> 00:10:38,647  X1:242 X2:477 Y1:488 Y2:523
You're with child?

133
00:10:40,046 --> 00:10:43,762  X1:128 X2:589 Y1:488 Y2:523
Three months. It's not showing yet.

134
00:10:43,802 --> 00:10:46,358  X1:238 X2:481 Y1:452 Y2:523
It wasn't planned,
it was an accident.

135
00:10:46,398 --> 00:10:48,956  X1:214 X2:505 Y1:488 Y2:523
Nice accident, though.

136
00:10:48,996 --> 00:10:52,595  X1:176 X2:543 Y1:452 Y2:523
Congratulations. Thank you.
How about you?

137
00:10:52,635 --> 00:10:55,148  X1:330 X2:389 Y1:488 Y2:523
No.

138
00:10:55,188 --> 00:10:56,786  X1:222 X2:497 Y1:488 Y2:523
Is there a Mr Blaine?

139
00:10:56,826 --> 00:10:58,665  X1:264 X2:455 Y1:488 Y2:523
Not any more.

140
00:10:58,705 --> 00:11:01,303  X1:238 X2:481 Y1:488 Y2:523
I'm all on my own.

141
00:11:01,343 --> 00:11:05,378  X1:130 X2:587 Y1:452 Y2:523
I had quite a sizeable family once
upon a time. Wonderful brothers. . .

142
00:11:05,418 --> 00:11:08,092  X1:228 X2:489 Y1:488 Y2:523
Oh, they were bold!

143
00:11:08,132 --> 00:11:09,980  X1:192 X2:527 Y1:488 Y2:523
But all of them gone now.

144
00:11:11,492 --> 00:11:14,726  X1:112 X2:607 Y1:488 Y2:523
Maybe you're right. Maybe I'm cursed.

145
00:11:14,766 --> 00:11:17,646  X1:202 X2:517 Y1:452 Y2:523
Oh, no, I don't think so,
not really.

146
00:11:17,686 --> 00:11:19,246  X1:248 X2:471 Y1:488 Y2:523
You're very kind.

147
00:11:19,286 --> 00:11:21,080  X1:322 X2:395 Y1:488 Y2:523
Er. . .

148
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:24,200  X1:236 X2:481 Y1:452 Y2:523
If you don't mind,
I might be a while.

149
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:27,157  X1:118 X2:601 Y1:452 Y2:523
You run along.
Perhaps we could do this another day.

150
00:11:27,197 --> 00:11:30,074  X1:206 X2:513 Y1:488 Y2:523
Are you all right? Fine!

151
00:11:30,114 --> 00:11:35,683  X1:160 X2:559 Y1:416 Y2:523
OK, I tell you what,
I'll leave my details with
your office. Thanks for talking.

152
00:11:36,587 --> 00:11:38,236  X1:284 X2:433 Y1:488 Y2:523
Thank you.

153
00:11:48,254 --> 00:11:49,778  X1:318 X2:401 Y1:488 Y2:523
Oh. . .

154
00:11:53,725 --> 00:11:55,818  X1:318 X2:401 Y1:488 Y2:523
Oh. . .

155
00:11:56,004 --> 00:11:58,201  X1:156 X2:563 Y1:488 Y2:523
You're lying through your teeth!

156
00:11:58,241 --> 00:12:04,274  X1:128 X2:591 Y1:416 Y2:523
I swear, it turns out the white
things are tusks, and I mean, tusks!
And it's woken and it's not happy!

157
00:12:04,314 --> 00:12:10,868  X1:120 X2:599 Y1:416 Y2:523
How could you not know it was there?
15 of us, naked, and I'm going like,
"Nothing to do with me!"

158
00:12:10,908 --> 00:12:15,103  X1:142 X2:575 Y1:452 Y2:523
Then it roars, and we are running!
Brakovitch falls, so I say. . .

159
00:12:15,143 --> 00:12:18,935  X1:154 X2:563 Y1:452 Y2:523
I knew we should've turned left!
That's my line!

160
00:12:18,975 --> 00:12:23,895  X1:166 X2:553 Y1:452 Y2:523
I don't believe a word you say!
That is so brilliant!

161
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:26,052  X1:134 X2:585 Y1:488 Y2:523
Did you ever get your clothes back?

162
00:12:26,092 --> 00:12:31,846  X1:146 X2:573 Y1:416 Y2:523
No, I just picked him up and went
right for the ship, full throttle.
I mean I was shaking!

163
00:12:31,886 --> 00:12:34,303  X1:228 X2:489 Y1:452 Y2:523
It was unbelievable!
It freaked me out. . .

164
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:38,713  X1:148 X2:571 Y1:488 Y2:523
And I was having such a nice day.

165
00:12:50,068 --> 00:12:55,499  X1:158 X2:559 Y1:416 Y2:523
According to intelligence,
the target is the last surviving
member of the Slitheen family,

166
00:12:55,539 --> 00:13:00,454  X1:148 X2:569 Y1:416 Y2:523
a criminal sect from the planet
Raxacoricofallapatorious,
masquerading as a human being.

167
00:13:00,494 --> 00:13:06,925  X1:136 X2:581 Y1:416 Y2:523
OK! Plan of attack, we assume a
basic 57-56 strategy, covering all
available exits on the ground floor.

168
00:13:06,965 --> 00:13:14,000  X1:132 X2:587 Y1:416 Y2:523
Doctor, you go face to face, that'll
designate exit 1. I'll cover exit 2.
Rose, exit 3. Mickey Smith, exit 4.

169
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:16,878  X1:168 X2:551 Y1:488 Y2:523
Excuse me. Who's in charge?

170
00:13:16,918 --> 00:13:19,474  X1:182 X2:537 Y1:488 Y2:523
Sorry. Awaiting orders, sir.

171
00:13:19,514 --> 00:13:22,056  X1:212 X2:505 Y1:488 Y2:523
Right, here's the plan.

172
00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:27,666  X1:164 X2:553 Y1:452 Y2:523
Like he said. Nice plan!
Anything else? Present arms.

173
00:13:27,706 --> 00:13:30,184  X1:208 X2:511 Y1:488 Y2:523
Ready. Ready. Ready.

174
00:13:30,224 --> 00:13:34,109  X1:158 X2:561 Y1:452 Y2:523
Speed dial? Yep.
Ready. Check. See you in hell.

175
00:13:41,692 --> 00:13:43,769  X1:228 X2:489 Y1:452 Y2:523
Hello, I've come to
see the Lord Mayor.

176
00:13:43,809 --> 00:13:45,446  X1:164 X2:555 Y1:488 Y2:523
Have you got an appointment?

177
00:13:45,486 --> 00:13:51,519  X1:132 X2:587 Y1:416 Y2:523
No, just an old friend, passing by,
bit of a surprise. I can't wait to
see her face. She'sjust having tea.

178
00:13:51,559 --> 00:13:55,397  X1:150 X2:567 Y1:452 Y2:523
Just go in there and tell her
the Doctor would like to see her.

179
00:13:55,437 --> 00:13:57,354  X1:170 X2:547 Y1:488 Y2:523
Doctor who? Just the Doctor.

180
00:13:57,394 --> 00:14:00,114  X1:150 X2:567 Y1:488 Y2:523
Tell her exactly that, the Doctor.

181
00:14:00,154 --> 00:14:02,446  X1:260 X2:459 Y1:488 Y2:523
Hang on a tick.

182
00:14:09,302 --> 00:14:11,964  X1:078 X2:295 Y1:488 Y2:523
CHINA SMASHES

183
00:14:17,092 --> 00:14:20,610  X1:196 X2:523 Y1:452 Y2:523
Er, the Lord Mayor says
thank you for popping by.

184
00:14:20,650 --> 00:14:25,003  X1:130 X2:589 Y1:452 Y2:523
She'd love to have a chat but, em. . .
she's up to her eyes in paperwork.

185
00:14:25,043 --> 00:14:28,281  X1:172 X2:545 Y1:452 Y2:523
Perhaps if you could make an
appointment for next week?

186
00:14:28,321 --> 00:14:32,217  X1:144 X2:573 Y1:452 Y2:523
She's climbing out of the window,
isn't she? Yes, she is.

187
00:14:40,309 --> 00:14:43,870  X1:128 X2:591 Y1:452 Y2:523
Slitheen heading north! On my way.
Over and out.

188
00:14:44,827 --> 00:14:46,147  X1:274 X2:445 Y1:488 Y2:523
Oh, my God!

189
00:14:46,187 --> 00:14:48,274  X1:208 X2:511 Y1:488 Y2:523
Leave the mayor alone!

190
00:15:20,627 --> 00:15:22,106  X1:290 X2:427 Y1:488 Y2:523
Margaret!

191
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:30,573  X1:248 X2:471 Y1:488 Y2:523
Who's on exit 4?

192
00:15:30,613 --> 00:15:32,730  X1:174 X2:545 Y1:488 Y2:523
That was Mickey! Here I am!

193
00:15:32,770 --> 00:15:38,246  X1:128 X2:591 Y1:452 Y2:523
Mickey the idiot. Oh, be fair, she's
not exactly gonna outrun us, is she?

194
00:15:38,286 --> 00:15:42,361  X1:226 X2:493 Y1:452 Y2:523
She's got a teleport,
that's cheating!

195
00:15:42,401 --> 00:15:45,808  X1:134 X2:585 Y1:452 Y2:523
Oh,
the Doctor's very good at teleports.

196
00:16:01,063 --> 00:16:08,572  X1:124 X2:595 Y1:416 Y2:523
I could do this all day. This is
persecution! Why can't you leave me
alone? What did I ever do to you?

197
00:16:08,612 --> 00:16:12,808  X1:130 X2:589 Y1:452 Y2:523
You tried to kill me and destroy
this entire planet. Apart from that?

198
00:16:12,848 --> 00:16:15,845  X1:156 X2:563 Y1:452 Y2:523
So you're a Slitheen,
you're on Earth, you're trapped.

199
00:16:15,885 --> 00:16:19,443  X1:214 X2:503 Y1:452 Y2:523
Your family get killed,
but you teleport out.

200
00:16:19,483 --> 00:16:24,557  X1:126 X2:593 Y1:416 Y2:523
You have no means of escape,
what do you do? You build a nuclear
power station, but what for?

201
00:16:24,597 --> 00:16:30,709  X1:132 X2:587 Y1:416 Y2:523
A philanthropic gesture. I've learnt
the error of my ways. And it just so
happens to be on top of the rift.

202
00:16:30,749 --> 00:16:37,023  X1:122 X2:597 Y1:416 Y2:523
What rift would that be? A rift in
space and time. If this went into
meltdown, the entire planet would. . .

203
00:16:37,063 --> 00:16:40,699  X1:140 X2:579 Y1:452 Y2:523
This station is designed to explode
the minute it reaches capacity.

204
00:16:40,739 --> 00:16:44,693  X1:118 X2:601 Y1:452 Y2:523
Didn't anyone notice? Doesn't anyone
in London check this stuff?

205
00:16:44,733 --> 00:16:51,087  X1:148 X2:571 Y1:416 Y2:523
We're in Cardiff, London doesn't
care! South Wales could fall into
the sea and they wouldn't notice.

206
00:16:51,127 --> 00:16:53,807  X1:166 X2:551 Y1:488 Y2:523
Oh. I sound like a Welshman.

207
00:16:53,847 --> 00:16:56,004  X1:162 X2:557 Y1:488 Y2:523
God help me, I've gone native.

208
00:16:56,044 --> 00:16:59,440  X1:150 X2:569 Y1:452 Y2:523
But why would she do that?
She'd only end up killing herself.

209
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:02,755  X1:190 X2:529 Y1:452 Y2:523
- She's got a name.
- She's a thing, not a she.

210
00:17:02,795 --> 00:17:05,337  X1:224 X2:495 Y1:488 Y2:523
Oh, but she's clever!

211
00:17:10,869 --> 00:17:17,221  X1:116 X2:603 Y1:416 Y2:523
Fantastic! Is that a tribophysical
waveform macro-kinetic extrapolator?
Couldn't have put it better myself.

212
00:17:17,261 --> 00:17:21,191  X1:136 X2:583 Y1:452 Y2:523
Ooh, genius! You didn't build this.
I have my hobbies.

213
00:17:23,494 --> 00:17:27,968  X1:134 X2:585 Y1:452 Y2:523
No, you REALLY didn't build this.
Way beyond you. I bet she stole it.

214
00:17:28,008 --> 00:17:31,165  X1:166 X2:553 Y1:452 Y2:523
It fell into my hands.
Is it a weapon? It's transport.

215
00:17:31,205 --> 00:17:36,362  X1:170 X2:549 Y1:416 Y2:523
You see, if the reactor blows,
the rift opens,
phenomenal cosmic disaster

216
00:17:36,402 --> 00:17:43,033  X1:148 X2:571 Y1:416 Y2:523
but this thing shrouds
you in a force field, you have this
energy bubble, so you're safe.

217
00:17:43,073 --> 00:17:47,229  X1:134 X2:585 Y1:452 Y2:523
You ride the concussion
all the way out of the solar system.

218
00:17:47,269 --> 00:17:50,227  X1:168 X2:551 Y1:452 Y2:523
It's a surfboard.
A pan-dimensional surfboard.

219
00:17:50,267 --> 00:17:54,939  X1:126 X2:593 Y1:452 Y2:523
I'd have surfed away from this
dead-end dump, back to civilisation.

220
00:17:54,979 --> 00:17:57,056  X1:132 X2:587 Y1:488 Y2:523
You'd blow up a planet to get a lift?

221
00:17:57,096 --> 00:17:59,775  X1:186 X2:533 Y1:488 Y2:523
Like stepping on an anthill.

222
00:17:59,815 --> 00:18:04,329  X1:108 X2:611 Y1:452 Y2:523
How did you think of the name? What?
Blaidd Drwg? It's Welsh.

223
00:18:04,369 --> 00:18:08,527  X1:134 X2:585 Y1:452 Y2:523
I know, but how did you think of it?
I chose it at random, that's all.

224
00:18:08,567 --> 00:18:12,293  X1:166 X2:553 Y1:452 Y2:523
I dunno, it just sounded good.
Does it matter?

225
00:18:15,797 --> 00:18:19,995  X1:166 X2:553 Y1:452 Y2:523
Blaidd Drwg. What's it mean?
Bad Wolf.

226
00:18:20,035 --> 00:18:24,629  X1:138 X2:581 Y1:452 Y2:523
I've heard that before, "Bad Wolf."
I've heard that lots of times.

227
00:18:24,669 --> 00:18:28,744  X1:206 X2:511 Y1:452 Y2:523
Everywhere we go,
two words following us.

228
00:18:28,784 --> 00:18:31,895  X1:166 X2:553 Y1:452 Y2:523
Bad Wolf.
How can they be following us?

229
00:18:35,097 --> 00:18:40,411  X1:128 X2:589 Y1:416 Y2:523
Nah, just a coincidence!
Like hearing a word on the radio,
then hearing it all day. Never mind!

230
00:18:40,451 --> 00:18:44,688  X1:112 X2:607 Y1:452 Y2:523
Margaret, we're gonna take you home.
Hold on, like letting her go?

231
00:18:44,728 --> 00:18:48,006  X1:158 X2:561 Y1:452 Y2:523
I don't believe it,
we actually get to go to Raxa. . .

232
00:18:48,046 --> 00:18:52,158  X1:186 X2:533 Y1:452 Y2:523
Wait a minute! Raxacori. . .
Raxacoricofallapatorious.

233
00:18:52,198 --> 00:18:54,157  X1:170 X2:547 Y1:488 Y2:523
Raxacorico. . . Fallapatorious.

234
00:18:54,197 --> 00:18:59,072  X1:198 X2:521 Y1:452 Y2:523
Raxacoricofallapatorious!
That's it! I did it!

235
00:18:59,112 --> 00:19:01,654  X1:174 X2:545 Y1:488 Y2:523
They have the death penalty.

236
00:19:05,542 --> 00:19:11,217  X1:148 X2:571 Y1:416 Y2:523
The family Slitheen
was tried in its absence
many years ago and found guilty.

237
00:19:11,257 --> 00:19:14,093  X1:194 X2:525 Y1:488 Y2:523
With no chance of appeal.

238
00:19:14,133 --> 00:19:18,690  X1:120 X2:599 Y1:452 Y2:523
According to the statutes, the
moment I return I am to be executed.

239
00:19:18,730 --> 00:19:20,988  X1:136 X2:583 Y1:488 Y2:523
What do you make of that, Doctor?

240
00:19:22,367 --> 00:19:27,077  X1:136 X2:583 Y1:452 Y2:523
Take me home, and you take
me to my death. Not my problem.

241
00:19:33,955 --> 00:19:37,272  X1:208 X2:509 Y1:488 Y2:523
This ship is impossible!

242
00:19:37,312 --> 00:19:41,429  X1:156 X2:563 Y1:452 Y2:523
It's superb! How do you get the
outside around the inside?

243
00:19:41,469 --> 00:19:44,341  X1:144 X2:575 Y1:488 Y2:523
Like I'd give you the secret, yeah.

244
00:19:44,381 --> 00:19:47,019  X1:216 X2:503 Y1:452 Y2:523
I almost feel better
about being defeated.

245
00:19:47,059 --> 00:19:50,894  X1:142 X2:577 Y1:452 Y2:523
We never stood a chance,
this is the technology of the gods.

246
00:19:50,934 --> 00:19:55,569  X1:142 X2:577 Y1:452 Y2:523
I'd make a very bad god. You
wouldn't get a day off for starters.

247
00:19:55,609 --> 00:19:57,409  X1:202 X2:517 Y1:488 Y2:523
Jack, are how we doing?

248
00:19:57,449 --> 00:20:00,644  X1:238 X2:481 Y1:452 Y2:523
This extrapolator's
top of the range.

249
00:20:00,684 --> 00:20:04,603  X1:132 X2:587 Y1:452 Y2:523
Where did you get it? I don't know.
Some airlock sale?

250
00:20:04,643 --> 00:20:09,756  X1:132 X2:587 Y1:416 Y2:523
It must have been a great big heist.
It's stacked with power.
But we can use it for fuel.

251
00:20:09,796 --> 00:20:15,473  X1:154 X2:565 Y1:416 Y2:523
It's not compatible, but it
should knock off about 12 hours,
we'll be ready to go by morning.

252
00:20:15,513 --> 00:20:18,271  X1:150 X2:567 Y1:488 Y2:523
Then we're stuck here overnight.

253
00:20:18,311 --> 00:20:19,904  X1:258 X2:461 Y1:488 Y2:523
I'm in no hurry.

254
00:20:19,944 --> 00:20:24,658  X1:156 X2:563 Y1:452 Y2:523
We've got a prisoner. The
police box is really a police box.

255
00:20:24,698 --> 00:20:27,736  X1:164 X2:555 Y1:488 Y2:523
You're not just police, though.

256
00:20:27,776 --> 00:20:33,452  X1:130 X2:589 Y1:452 Y2:523
Since you're taking me to my death,
that makes you my executioners.

257
00:20:33,492 --> 00:20:36,410  X1:188 X2:531 Y1:488 Y2:523
Each and every one of you.

258
00:20:36,450 --> 00:20:38,537  X1:224 X2:495 Y1:488 Y2:523
Well, you deserve it.

259
00:20:39,563 --> 00:20:42,041  X1:184 X2:535 Y1:488 Y2:523
You're very quick to say so.

260
00:20:42,081 --> 00:20:47,775  X1:128 X2:589 Y1:416 Y2:523
You're very quick to soak your hands
in my blood. Which makes you
better than me how, exactly?

261
00:20:49,995 --> 00:20:52,452  X1:242 X2:477 Y1:488 Y2:523
Long night ahead.

262
00:21:06,614 --> 00:21:09,526  X1:120 X2:597 Y1:488 Y2:523
Let's see who can look me in the eye.

263
00:21:37,219 --> 00:21:39,418  X1:218 X2:499 Y1:488 Y2:523
It's freezing out here.

264
00:21:39,458 --> 00:21:42,000  X1:226 X2:493 Y1:488 Y2:523
Better than in there.

265
00:21:44,855 --> 00:21:48,412  X1:190 X2:529 Y1:452 Y2:523
She does deserve it, she's
a Slitheen, I don't care.

266
00:21:48,452 --> 00:21:52,223  X1:182 X2:537 Y1:488 Y2:523
It's just. . .weird in that box.

267
00:21:53,125 --> 00:21:56,322  X1:152 X2:565 Y1:488 Y2:523
I didn't really need my passport.

268
00:22:03,834 --> 00:22:08,952  X1:170 X2:549 Y1:452 Y2:523
I've been thinking, you know,
we could. . .go have a drink,

269
00:22:08,992 --> 00:22:13,620  X1:150 X2:569 Y1:452 Y2:523
have a pizza or something,
just you and me. That'd be nice.

270
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:18,785  X1:160 X2:559 Y1:452 Y2:523
And I mean, if the Tardis can't
leave until morning we could. . .

271
00:22:20,734 --> 00:22:23,414  X1:148 X2:571 Y1:488 Y2:523
 .go to a hotel, spend the night?

272
00:22:23,454 --> 00:22:27,728  X1:144 X2:575 Y1:452 Y2:523
I mean if you want to,
I've got some money. OK. Yeah.

273
00:22:27,768 --> 00:22:31,084  X1:208 X2:509 Y1:488 Y2:523
Is that all right? Yeah.

274
00:22:32,445 --> 00:22:36,799  X1:122 X2:597 Y1:452 Y2:523
Cool, er. . .there's a couple of bars
round here, we should give 'em a go.

275
00:22:36,839 --> 00:22:39,396  X1:156 X2:563 Y1:488 Y2:523
Do you have to go and tell him?

276
00:22:39,436 --> 00:22:41,694  X1:198 X2:519 Y1:488 Y2:523
It's none of his business.

277
00:22:45,550 --> 00:22:47,070  X1:266 X2:453 Y1:488 Y2:523
So what's on?

278
00:22:47,110 --> 00:22:50,016  X1:254 X2:463 Y1:488 Y2:523
Nothing, just. . .

279
00:22:53,938 --> 00:22:56,600  X1:156 X2:563 Y1:488 Y2:523
I gather it's not always like this.

280
00:22:58,058 --> 00:22:59,571  X1:260 X2:459 Y1:488 Y2:523
Having to wait.

281
00:23:05,208 --> 00:23:08,164  X1:214 X2:505 Y1:452 Y2:523
I bet you're always the
first to leave, Doctor.

282
00:23:08,204 --> 00:23:11,163  X1:162 X2:557 Y1:452 Y2:523
Never mind the consequences,
off you go.

283
00:23:11,203 --> 00:23:15,677  X1:142 X2:577 Y1:452 Y2:523
You butchered my family and then
ran for the stars, am I right?

284
00:23:15,717 --> 00:23:18,114  X1:242 X2:475 Y1:488 Y2:523
But not this time.

285
00:23:18,154 --> 00:23:20,787  X1:160 X2:559 Y1:488 Y2:523
At last you have consequences.

286
00:23:22,912 --> 00:23:25,904  X1:218 X2:501 Y1:452 Y2:523
How does it feel?
I didn't butcher them.

287
00:23:25,944 --> 00:23:28,782  X1:158 X2:561 Y1:452 Y2:523
Don't answer back,
that's what she wants. I didn't.

288
00:23:28,822 --> 00:23:35,577  X1:102 X2:617 Y1:416 Y2:523
What about you? You had an emergency
teleport. You didn't zap them
to safety. It only carries one.

289
00:23:35,617 --> 00:23:37,694  X1:150 X2:569 Y1:488 Y2:523
I had to fly without co-ordinates.

290
00:23:37,734 --> 00:23:42,248  X1:180 X2:539 Y1:452 Y2:523
I ended up in a skip
on the Isle of Dogs. Ha-ha!

291
00:23:42,288 --> 00:23:44,207  X1:256 X2:461 Y1:488 Y2:523
It wasn't funny.

292
00:23:44,247 --> 00:23:45,720  X1:314 X2:403 Y1:488 Y2:523
Sorry.

293
00:23:48,482 --> 00:23:50,450  X1:254 X2:463 Y1:488 Y2:523
It is a bit funny.

294
00:23:54,356 --> 00:23:56,796  X1:206 X2:511 Y1:488 Y2:523
Do I get a last request?

295
00:23:56,836 --> 00:23:58,969  X1:234 X2:485 Y1:488 Y2:523
Depends what it is.

296
00:23:59,993 --> 00:24:04,063  X1:176 X2:543 Y1:452 Y2:523
I grew quite fond of my little
human life, all those rituals.

297
00:24:04,103 --> 00:24:07,981  X1:142 X2:577 Y1:452 Y2:523
The brushing of the teeth and the
complicated way they cook things.

298
00:24:08,021 --> 00:24:13,556  X1:132 X2:587 Y1:416 Y2:523
There's a little restaurant,
just round the bay,
it became quite a favourite of mine.

299
00:24:18,773 --> 00:24:21,366  X1:134 X2:585 Y1:488 Y2:523
Is that what you want, a last meal?

300
00:24:21,406 --> 00:24:24,562  X1:166 X2:551 Y1:452 Y2:523
Don't I have rights? Oh, like
she's not gonna try to escape.

301
00:24:24,602 --> 00:24:28,953  X1:158 X2:561 Y1:452 Y2:523
Except I can never escape the
Doctor, so where's the danger?

302
00:24:32,515 --> 00:24:35,872  X1:188 X2:531 Y1:488 Y2:523
I wonder if you could do it.

303
00:24:35,912 --> 00:24:40,912  X1:170 X2:547 Y1:452 Y2:523
To sit with a creature you're
about to kill and take supper.

304
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:45,260  X1:174 X2:545 Y1:488 Y2:523
How strong is your stomach?

305
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:47,888  X1:192 X2:527 Y1:488 Y2:523
Strong enough. I wonder.

306
00:24:48,979 --> 00:24:51,766  X1:148 X2:571 Y1:488 Y2:523
I've seen you fight your enemies.

307
00:24:52,733 --> 00:24:54,701  X1:224 X2:495 Y1:488 Y2:523
Now dine with them.

308
00:24:56,208 --> 00:24:58,711  X1:122 X2:597 Y1:488 Y2:523
You won't change my mind. Prove it.

309
00:25:02,003 --> 00:25:04,522  X1:182 X2:537 Y1:488 Y2:523
There are people out there.

310
00:25:04,562 --> 00:25:10,556  X1:176 X2:543 Y1:416 Y2:523
If you slip away just for one
second, they'll be in danger.
Except. . .I've got these.

311
00:25:10,596 --> 00:25:17,227  X1:146 X2:573 Y1:452 Y2:523
You both wear one. If she moves
more than ten feet away, zzzt!

312
00:25:17,267 --> 00:25:21,501  X1:144 X2:575 Y1:488 Y2:523
She gets zapped by 10, 000 volts.

313
00:25:21,541 --> 00:25:25,232  X1:162 X2:557 Y1:452 Y2:523
Margaret, would you like to
come out to dinner? My treat.

314
00:25:26,775 --> 00:25:28,788  X1:236 X2:483 Y1:488 Y2:523
Dinner in bondage.

315
00:25:30,690 --> 00:25:32,942  X1:254 X2:465 Y1:488 Y2:523
It works for me.

316
00:26:08,931 --> 00:26:12,806  X1:124 X2:593 Y1:452 Y2:523
Here we are out on a date, and you
haven't even asked my proper name.

317
00:26:12,846 --> 00:26:15,244  X1:262 X2:457 Y1:488 Y2:523
It's not a date.

318
00:26:15,284 --> 00:26:18,365  X1:192 X2:527 Y1:488 Y2:523
What's your name? Blon.

319
00:26:18,405 --> 00:26:21,998  X1:196 X2:523 Y1:452 Y2:523
I'm Blon Fel Fotch
Passameer-Day Slitheen.

320
00:26:22,038 --> 00:26:25,676  X1:206 X2:513 Y1:452 Y2:523
That's what it'll say
on my death certificate.

321
00:26:25,716 --> 00:26:27,912  X1:204 X2:515 Y1:488 Y2:523
Nice to meet you, Blon.

322
00:26:27,952 --> 00:26:29,946  X1:296 X2:423 Y1:488 Y2:523
I'm sure.

323
00:26:29,986 --> 00:26:35,621  X1:166 X2:553 Y1:416 Y2:523
Look, that's where I was living
as Margaret, a nice little flat,
over there. On the top.

324
00:26:35,661 --> 00:26:38,261  X1:146 X2:573 Y1:488 Y2:523
Next to the one with the light on.

325
00:26:38,301 --> 00:26:42,495  X1:162 X2:557 Y1:452 Y2:523
Two bedrooms, bay-side view,
I was rather content.

326
00:26:42,535 --> 00:26:44,383  X1:158 X2:559 Y1:488 Y2:523
I don't suppose I'll see it again.

327
00:26:49,129 --> 00:26:51,086  X1:270 X2:447 Y1:488 Y2:523
Suppose not.

328
00:26:51,126 --> 00:26:52,766  X1:284 X2:433 Y1:488 Y2:523
Thank you.

329
00:26:52,806 --> 00:26:54,609  X1:294 X2:425 Y1:488 Y2:523
Pleasure!

330
00:26:56,162 --> 00:27:00,077  X1:144 X2:573 Y1:452 Y2:523
Tell me then, Doctor,
what do you know of our species?

331
00:27:00,117 --> 00:27:01,837  X1:228 X2:491 Y1:488 Y2:523
Only what I've seen.

332
00:27:01,877 --> 00:27:07,988  X1:112 X2:607 Y1:452 Y2:523
Did you know, for example, in extreme
cases, when her life is in danger,

333
00:27:08,028 --> 00:27:14,462  X1:152 X2:565 Y1:416 Y2:523
a female Raxacoricofallapatorian
can manufacture a poison dart
within her own finger?

334
00:27:14,502 --> 00:27:16,999  X1:194 X2:523 Y1:488 Y2:523
Yes, I did. Just checking.

335
00:27:18,179 --> 00:27:20,576  X1:224 X2:493 Y1:488 Y2:523
And one more thing,

336
00:27:20,616 --> 00:27:23,693  X1:208 X2:511 Y1:488 Y2:523
between you and me. . .

337
00:27:27,370 --> 00:27:33,957  X1:142 X2:577 Y1:416 Y2:523
 .as a final resort,
the excess poison
can be exhaled through the lungs.

338
00:27:35,839 --> 00:27:41,698  X1:118 X2:599 Y1:416 Y2:523
That's better. Now then, what
d'you think? Mmm, steak looks nice.
Steak and chips!

339
00:27:45,905 --> 00:27:49,624  X1:146 X2:573 Y1:452 Y2:523
The Doctor took me to this planet
a while back.

340
00:27:49,664 --> 00:27:53,698  X1:174 X2:545 Y1:452 Y2:523
It was much colder than this.
They called it Women Wept.

341
00:27:53,738 --> 00:28:00,372  X1:120 X2:599 Y1:416 Y2:523
The planet was actually called Women
Wept cos if you looked at it from
above, there's this huge continent,

342
00:28:00,412 --> 00:28:04,768  X1:150 X2:569 Y1:452 Y2:523
like all curved round. It sort of
looked like a woman, lamenting.

343
00:28:04,808 --> 00:28:08,244  X1:192 X2:527 Y1:452 Y2:523
Oh, my God, and we went
to this beach, right?

344
00:28:08,284 --> 00:28:13,040  X1:134 X2:585 Y1:452 Y2:523
No people, no buildings, just this
beach like a thousand miles across.

345
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:18,317  X1:122 X2:597 Y1:416 Y2:523
Something had happened, something
to do with the sun, I don't know,
but the sea had just frozen.

346
00:28:18,357 --> 00:28:21,668  X1:156 X2:563 Y1:452 Y2:523
Like in a split second,
in the middle of a storm, right?

347
00:28:21,708 --> 00:28:25,225  X1:168 X2:551 Y1:452 Y2:523
Waves and foam, just frozen,
all the way out to the horizon.

348
00:28:25,265 --> 00:28:30,262  X1:132 X2:587 Y1:416 Y2:523
Midnight,
we walk underneath these waves,
a hundred feet tall and made of ice.

349
00:28:30,302 --> 00:28:34,073  X1:142 X2:575 Y1:488 Y2:523
I'm going out with Trisha Delaney.

350
00:28:35,535 --> 00:28:37,972  X1:290 X2:427 Y1:488 Y2:523
Oh, right.

351
00:28:38,012 --> 00:28:40,330  X1:282 X2:437 Y1:488 Y2:523
That's nice.

352
00:28:40,370 --> 00:28:44,527  X1:182 X2:537 Y1:452 Y2:523
Trisha from the shop?
Yeah, Rob Delaney's sister.

353
00:28:44,567 --> 00:28:47,083  X1:250 X2:469 Y1:488 Y2:523
Well, she's nice.

354
00:28:47,123 --> 00:28:49,131  X1:152 X2:565 Y1:488 Y2:523
She's a bit big. She lost weight.

355
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:54,115  X1:238 X2:481 Y1:488 Y2:523
You've been away.

356
00:28:54,155 --> 00:28:56,663  X1:162 X2:555 Y1:488 Y2:523
Well, good for you, she's nice.

357
00:28:58,670 --> 00:29:02,686  X1:144 X2:573 Y1:452 Y2:523
So tell us more about this planet,
then. That was it, really.

358
00:29:07,538 --> 00:29:10,496  X1:156 X2:563 Y1:488 Y2:523
Public execution's a slow death.

359
00:29:11,975 --> 00:29:17,993  X1:160 X2:557 Y1:416 Y2:523
They prepare a thin acetic acid,
lower me into the cauldron. . .
and boil me.

360
00:29:18,809 --> 00:29:22,806  X1:168 X2:551 Y1:452 Y2:523
The acidity is perfectly
gauged to strip away the skin.

361
00:29:22,846 --> 00:29:25,722  X1:220 X2:499 Y1:452 Y2:523
Internal organs
fall out into the liquid

362
00:29:25,762 --> 00:29:27,920  X1:232 X2:487 Y1:488 Y2:523
and I become soup.

363
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:30,037  X1:264 X2:455 Y1:488 Y2:523
And still alive.

364
00:29:30,077 --> 00:29:35,031  X1:172 X2:547 Y1:452 Y2:523
Still screaming. I don't make
the law. But you deliver it.

365
00:29:35,913 --> 00:29:37,392  X1:210 X2:509 Y1:488 Y2:523
Will you stay to watch?

366
00:29:39,065 --> 00:29:40,704  X1:230 X2:487 Y1:488 Y2:523
What else can I do?

367
00:29:40,744 --> 00:29:46,660  X1:110 X2:609 Y1:416 Y2:523
The Slitheen family's huge,
there's a lot more of us, all
scattered off-world. Take me to them.

368
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:48,460  X1:190 X2:529 Y1:488 Y2:523
Take me somewhere safe.

369
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:51,176  X1:162 X2:557 Y1:452 Y2:523
But then you'll just start again.
I promise I won't.

370
00:29:51,216 --> 00:29:56,728  X1:134 X2:585 Y1:416 Y2:523
You've been in that skin-suit too
long, you've forgotten. There used
to be a real Margaret Blaine.

371
00:29:56,768 --> 00:30:02,682  X1:138 X2:581 Y1:416 Y2:523
You killed her and stripped her and
used the skin. You're pleading for
mercy out of a dead woman's lips.

372
00:30:02,722 --> 00:30:07,796  X1:168 X2:551 Y1:452 Y2:523
Perhaps I have got used to it.
A human life, an ordinary life.

373
00:30:07,836 --> 00:30:10,299  X1:224 X2:495 Y1:488 Y2:523
That's all I'm asking.

374
00:30:11,869 --> 00:30:14,087  X1:190 X2:527 Y1:488 Y2:523
Give me a chance, Doctor.

375
00:30:15,706 --> 00:30:18,823  X1:144 X2:573 Y1:488 Y2:523
I can change. I don't believe you.

376
00:30:20,701 --> 00:30:24,023  X1:114 X2:605 Y1:452 Y2:523
So what do you want to do now? Don't
mind.

377
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:27,615  X1:186 X2:533 Y1:488 Y2:523
We could ask about hotels.

378
00:30:27,655 --> 00:30:30,012  X1:154 X2:563 Y1:488 Y2:523
What would Trisha Delaney say?

379
00:30:30,052 --> 00:30:37,086  X1:124 X2:593 Y1:416 Y2:523
Suppose. There's a bar down there
with a Spanish name or something. . .
You don't even like Trisha Delaney!

380
00:30:37,126 --> 00:30:39,003  X1:180 X2:537 Y1:488 Y2:523
What the hell do you know?

381
00:30:39,043 --> 00:30:44,478  X1:130 X2:589 Y1:416 Y2:523
I know YOU! And I know her, and I
know that's never gonna happen, so
who do you think you're kidding? !

382
00:30:44,518 --> 00:30:46,161  X1:174 X2:543 Y1:488 Y2:523
At least I know where she is!

383
00:30:48,154 --> 00:30:50,430  X1:230 X2:489 Y1:488 Y2:523
There we are, then.

384
00:30:50,470 --> 00:30:55,015  X1:144 X2:575 Y1:452 Y2:523
It's got nothing to do with Trisha,
this is all about me! You left me!

385
00:30:56,862 --> 00:31:01,617  X1:108 X2:611 Y1:452 Y2:523
We were nice, we were happy, then you
give me a kiss and run off with him

386
00:31:01,657 --> 00:31:05,453  X1:134 X2:585 Y1:452 Y2:523
and you make me feel like nothing,
Rose! I was nothing!

387
00:31:05,493 --> 00:31:12,207  X1:138 X2:581 Y1:416 Y2:523
I can't even go out with a stupid
girl from a shop because you pick
up the phone and I comes running.

388
00:31:12,247 --> 00:31:15,483  X1:146 X2:573 Y1:452 Y2:523
I mean, is that what I am, Rose -
standby?

389
00:31:15,523 --> 00:31:21,262  X1:138 X2:579 Y1:416 Y2:523
Am I just supposed to sit here for
the rest of my life waiting for you?
Because I will! I'm sorry.

390
00:31:29,189 --> 00:31:33,183  X1:188 X2:529 Y1:452 Y2:523
I promise you I've changed
since we last met, Doctor.

391
00:31:33,223 --> 00:31:36,263  X1:164 X2:555 Y1:488 Y2:523
There was this girl, just today,

392
00:31:36,303 --> 00:31:39,020  X1:264 X2:455 Y1:488 Y2:523
a young thing.

393
00:31:39,060 --> 00:31:42,412  X1:180 X2:537 Y1:452 Y2:523
And something of a danger,
she was getting too close.

394
00:31:42,452 --> 00:31:50,407  X1:124 X2:593 Y1:416 Y2:523
I felt the blood lust rising, just as
the family taught me. I was going to
kill her without a thought. Then. . .

395
00:31:50,447 --> 00:31:52,580  X1:290 X2:429 Y1:488 Y2:523
I stopped.

396
00:31:54,481 --> 00:32:01,515  X1:134 X2:585 Y1:416 Y2:523
She's alive somewhere, right now,
she's walking round this city,
because I can change, I did change.

397
00:32:01,555 --> 00:32:04,710  X1:216 X2:503 Y1:452 Y2:523
I know I can't prove it.
I believe you.

398
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:07,466  X1:124 X2:595 Y1:488 Y2:523
Then you know I'm capable of better.

399
00:32:07,506 --> 00:32:09,145  X1:194 X2:525 Y1:488 Y2:523
It doesn't mean anything.

400
00:32:09,185 --> 00:32:11,464  X1:250 X2:469 Y1:488 Y2:523
I spared her life.

401
00:32:11,504 --> 00:32:14,301  X1:204 X2:513 Y1:452 Y2:523
You let one of them go,
but that's nothing new.

402
00:32:14,341 --> 00:32:18,576  X1:130 X2:589 Y1:452 Y2:523
Every now and then, a little
victim's spared because she smiled,

403
00:32:18,616 --> 00:32:21,453  X1:220 X2:497 Y1:452 Y2:523
cos he's got freckles,
cos they begged.

404
00:32:21,493 --> 00:32:27,886  X1:144 X2:575 Y1:416 Y2:523
And that's how you
live with yourself,
that's how you slaughter millions,

405
00:32:27,926 --> 00:32:35,000  X1:130 X2:589 Y1:416 Y2:523
because once in a while, on a whim,
if the wind's in the right
direction, you happen to be kind.

406
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:37,677  X1:168 X2:549 Y1:488 Y2:523
Only a killer would know that.

407
00:32:37,717 --> 00:32:44,029  X1:134 X2:585 Y1:416 Y2:523
Is that right? From what I've seen,
your funny little, happy-go-lucky
life leaves devastation in its wake.

408
00:32:44,069 --> 00:32:47,544  X1:196 X2:523 Y1:452 Y2:523
Always moving on,
cos you dare not go back.

409
00:32:47,584 --> 00:32:51,401  X1:130 X2:589 Y1:452 Y2:523
Playing with so many people's lives,
you might as well be a god.

410
00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:55,455  X1:198 X2:519 Y1:488 Y2:523
And you're right, Doctor,

411
00:32:55,495 --> 00:32:57,455  X1:210 X2:509 Y1:488 Y2:523
you're absolutely right.

412
00:32:57,495 --> 00:33:01,551  X1:174 X2:545 Y1:488 Y2:523
Sometimes. . .you let one go.

413
00:33:03,568 --> 00:33:05,092  X1:284 X2:433 Y1:488 Y2:523
Let me go.

414
00:33:11,163 --> 00:33:15,197  X1:154 X2:565 Y1:452 Y2:523
I'm not asking you to leave him,
cos I know that's not fair.

415
00:33:15,237 --> 00:33:21,028  X1:122 X2:597 Y1:416 Y2:523
But I just need something, some sort
of promise, that when you do come
back, you're coming back for me.

416
00:33:21,068 --> 00:33:24,108  X1:078 X2:501 Y1:452 Y2:523
RUMBLING
Is that thunder? Does it matter?

417
00:33:24,148 --> 00:33:26,624  X1:234 X2:485 Y1:488 Y2:523
That's not thunder.

418
00:33:26,664 --> 00:33:31,857  X1:116 X2:603 Y1:416 Y2:523
In the family Slitheen,
we had no choice. I was made to carry
out my first kill at 13.

419
00:33:31,897 --> 00:33:35,653  X1:148 X2:571 Y1:452 Y2:523
If I'd refused, my father would
have fed me to the venom grubs!

420
00:33:35,693 --> 00:33:38,773  X1:162 X2:557 Y1:452 Y2:523
If I'm a killer, it's because I
was born to kill, it's all I know!

421
00:33:38,813 --> 00:33:42,765  X1:078 X2:575 Y1:452 Y2:523
RUMBLING
Doctor? Are you even listening to me?

422
00:33:42,805 --> 00:33:47,600  X1:156 X2:563 Y1:452 Y2:523
Can you hear that? I'm begging
for my life! Listen, shush.

423
00:33:57,112 --> 00:34:00,984  X1:128 X2:591 Y1:452 Y2:523
Ah, go on then, run! It's him again,
isn't it? ! It's the Doctor!

424
00:34:01,024 --> 00:34:04,351  X1:132 X2:585 Y1:452 Y2:523
It's always the Doctor! It's always
gonna be the Doctor, it's never me!

425
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:07,498  X1:266 X2:453 Y1:488 Y2:523
My handcuffs!

426
00:34:11,617 --> 00:34:15,930  X1:154 X2:565 Y1:452 Y2:523
Don't think you're running away.
Oh, I'm sticking with you!

427
00:34:15,970 --> 00:34:18,148  X1:150 X2:567 Y1:488 Y2:523
Some date this turned out to be!

428
00:34:30,916 --> 00:34:33,498  X1:162 X2:557 Y1:488 Y2:523
It's the rift. The rift's opening.

429
00:34:52,572 --> 00:34:56,807  X1:174 X2:545 Y1:452 Y2:523
What the hell are you doing?
It just went crazy!

430
00:34:56,847 --> 00:35:02,461  X1:146 X2:573 Y1:416 Y2:523
It's the rift!
Time and space are ripping apart,
the whole city's gonna disappear!

431
00:35:35,925 --> 00:35:41,201  X1:162 X2:557 Y1:416 Y2:523
It's the extrapolator!
I've disconnected it, but
it's still feeding off the engine.

432
00:35:41,241 --> 00:35:45,993  X1:166 X2:553 Y1:416 Y2:523
It's using the Tardis!
Never mind Cardiff,
it's gonna rip open the planet.

433
00:35:46,033 --> 00:35:49,963  X1:150 X2:569 Y1:452 Y2:523
What is it? ! What's happening? !
Oh, just little me!

434
00:35:51,907 --> 00:35:57,500  X1:132 X2:587 Y1:452 Y2:523
One wrong move and she snaps like
a promise. I might have known.

435
00:35:57,540 --> 00:36:03,378  X1:166 X2:553 Y1:452 Y2:523
I've had you bleating all night,
poor baby, now shut it. You!

436
00:36:03,418 --> 00:36:07,758  X1:156 X2:563 Y1:452 Y2:523
Fly boy!
Put the extrapolator at my feet!

437
00:36:20,401 --> 00:36:22,198  X1:284 X2:433 Y1:488 Y2:523
Thank you.

438
00:36:23,592 --> 00:36:28,388  X1:154 X2:565 Y1:416 Y2:523
Just as I planned.
I thought you needed to blow up
the nuclear power station.

439
00:36:28,428 --> 00:36:31,826  X1:194 X2:525 Y1:452 Y2:523
Failing that,
if I were to be. . .arrested,

440
00:36:31,866 --> 00:36:38,740  X1:120 X2:599 Y1:416 Y2:523
then anyone capable of tracking me
down would have considerable
technology of their own. Therefore. . .

441
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:42,097  X1:162 X2:555 Y1:452 Y2:523
they would be
captivated by the extrapolator.

442
00:36:42,137 --> 00:36:46,210  X1:198 X2:521 Y1:452 Y2:523
Especially a magpie mind
like yours, Doctor.

443
00:36:46,250 --> 00:36:50,888  X1:140 X2:579 Y1:452 Y2:523
So the extrapolator
was programmed to go to Plan B -

444
00:36:50,928 --> 00:36:56,559  X1:126 X2:593 Y1:452 Y2:523
to lock on to the nearest
alien power source and open the rift.

445
00:36:56,599 --> 00:37:00,116  X1:132 X2:587 Y1:488 Y2:523
And what a power source it found. . .

446
00:37:00,156 --> 00:37:02,593  X1:208 X2:511 Y1:488 Y2:523
I'm back on schedule. . .

447
00:37:02,633 --> 00:37:05,670  X1:264 X2:455 Y1:488 Y2:523
thanks to you.

448
00:37:05,710 --> 00:37:10,175  X1:130 X2:589 Y1:452 Y2:523
The rift's gonna convulse, you'll
destroy the planet. And you with it!

449
00:37:12,661 --> 00:37:19,533  X1:180 X2:539 Y1:416 Y2:523
While I ride this board
over the crest of the inferno
all the way to freedom!

450
00:37:19,573 --> 00:37:22,400  X1:242 X2:477 Y1:488 Y2:523
Stand back, boys!

451
00:37:23,333 --> 00:37:25,790  X1:292 X2:425 Y1:488 Y2:523
Surf's up!

452
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:40,951  X1:150 X2:567 Y1:452 Y2:523
Of course, opening the rift
means you'll pull this ship apart.

453
00:37:40,991 --> 00:37:42,866  X1:282 X2:437 Y1:488 Y2:523
So sue me!

454
00:37:42,906 --> 00:37:45,026  X1:144 X2:575 Y1:488 Y2:523
It's not just any old power source.

455
00:37:45,066 --> 00:37:49,741  X1:170 X2:549 Y1:452 Y2:523
It's the Tardis, my Tardis.
The best ship in the universe.

456
00:37:49,781 --> 00:37:52,139  X1:188 X2:531 Y1:488 Y2:523
It'll make wonderful scrap.

457
00:37:52,179 --> 00:37:55,777  X1:208 X2:511 Y1:452 Y2:523
What's that light? !
The heart of the Tardis.

458
00:37:55,817 --> 00:37:59,463  X1:208 X2:511 Y1:452 Y2:523
This ship's alive.
You've opened its soul.

459
00:38:03,648 --> 00:38:05,331  X1:316 X2:403 Y1:488 Y2:523
It's. . .

460
00:38:06,923 --> 00:38:09,282  X1:270 X2:449 Y1:488 Y2:523
 .so bright. . .

461
00:38:09,322 --> 00:38:11,401  X1:224 X2:495 Y1:488 Y2:523
Look at it, Margaret.

462
00:38:11,441 --> 00:38:13,954  X1:280 X2:439 Y1:488 Y2:523
Beautiful. . .

463
00:38:13,994 --> 00:38:16,633  X1:180 X2:537 Y1:488 Y2:523
Look inside, Blon Fel Fotch.

464
00:38:16,673 --> 00:38:19,045  X1:246 X2:473 Y1:488 Y2:523
Look at the light.

465
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:50,468  X1:284 X2:433 Y1:488 Y2:523
Thank you.

466
00:39:00,148 --> 00:39:03,185  X1:180 X2:539 Y1:452 Y2:523
Don't look!
Stay there, close your eyes!

467
00:39:04,983 --> 00:39:10,683  X1:150 X2:569 Y1:416 Y2:523
Jack, shut it all down!
Rose, that panel over there,
turn all the switches to the right!

468
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:30,873  X1:172 X2:547 Y1:452 Y2:523
Nicely done. Thank you, all.
What happened to Margaret?

469
00:39:30,913 --> 00:39:35,990  X1:130 X2:587 Y1:416 Y2:523
Must've got burnt up,
carried out her own death sentence.
I don't think she's dead.

470
00:39:36,030 --> 00:39:41,861  X1:142 X2:577 Y1:416 Y2:523
Then where'd she go? She looked
into the heart of the Tardis. Even
I don't know how strong that is.

471
00:39:41,901 --> 00:39:47,895  X1:186 X2:533 Y1:416 Y2:523
And the ship's telepathic,
it gets inside your head,
translates alien languages.

472
00:39:47,935 --> 00:39:52,116  X1:134 X2:585 Y1:452 Y2:523
Maybe the raw energy can translate
all sorts of thoughts.

473
00:39:55,490 --> 00:39:57,726  X1:278 X2:441 Y1:488 Y2:523
Here she is!

474
00:39:57,766 --> 00:40:02,363  X1:156 X2:563 Y1:452 Y2:523
She's an egg? Regressed
to her childhood. She's an egg!

475
00:40:02,403 --> 00:40:08,434  X1:132 X2:585 Y1:416 Y2:523
She can start again. If we take her
home, give her to a different family
who bring her up properly,

476
00:40:08,474 --> 00:40:14,549  X1:136 X2:583 Y1:416 Y2:523
she might be all right. Or she
might be worse. That's her choice.
She's an egg. She's an egg.

477
00:40:14,589 --> 00:40:17,086  X1:222 X2:497 Y1:488 Y2:523
Oh, my God, Mickey!

478
00:41:07,252 --> 00:41:13,066  X1:172 X2:547 Y1:416 Y2:523
Opening the rift filled us up
with energy, we can go.
If that's all right. Yeah, fine.

479
00:41:14,004 --> 00:41:17,678  X1:126 X2:593 Y1:488 Y2:523
How's Mickey? He's OK. He's gone.

480
00:41:17,718 --> 00:41:24,191  X1:160 X2:559 Y1:416 Y2:523
Do you wanna go and find him?
We'll wait.
No need. He deserves better.

481
00:41:24,231 --> 00:41:27,588  X1:128 X2:591 Y1:488 Y2:523
Off we go, then. Always moving on.

482
00:41:27,628 --> 00:41:30,386  X1:128 X2:591 Y1:488 Y2:523
Next stop, Raxacoricofallapatorious.

483
00:41:30,426 --> 00:41:32,386  X1:130 X2:589 Y1:488 Y2:523
Now you don't often get to say that.

484
00:41:32,426 --> 00:41:37,661  X1:144 X2:575 Y1:416 Y2:523
We'll pop her in the hatchery.
Margaret the Slitheen can live her
life again. A second chance.

485
00:41:37,701 --> 00:41:40,323  X1:262 X2:457 Y1:488 Y2:523
That'd be nice.

486
00:41:56,955 --> 00:42:01,390  X1:122 X2:597 Y1:272 Y2:343
You got chosen, you're a housemate,
you're in the house!

487
00:42:01,430 --> 00:42:04,870  X1:164 X2:555 Y1:488 Y2:523
Welcome to The Weakest Link.

488
00:42:04,910 --> 00:42:08,806  X1:122 X2:595 Y1:452 Y2:523
We're giving you a brand-new image.
What's wrong with what I'm wearing?

489
00:42:10,304 --> 00:42:12,317  X1:128 X2:589 Y1:488 Y2:523
What was that? She's been evicted.

490
00:42:14,662 --> 00:42:19,013  X1:198 X2:521 Y1:452 Y2:523
This isn't just a game.
I need to find the Doctor!

491
00:42:19,053 --> 00:42:22,332  X1:120 X2:599 Y1:452 Y2:523
There's something else going on. We
have contestants outside the games.

492
00:42:22,372 --> 00:42:25,170  X1:202 X2:515 Y1:452 Y2:523
They fear the Doctor.
Tell me, who are they? !

493
00:42:25,210 --> 00:42:28,486  X1:142 X2:577 Y1:452 Y2:523
That's impossible. I know
those ships, they were destroyed.

494
00:42:28,526 --> 00:42:33,560  X1:164 X2:555 Y1:452 Y2:523
Obviously they survived.
Alert, alert! We are detected!

495
00:44:04,906 --> 00:44:10,820  X1:140 X2:577 Y1:488 Y2:523
