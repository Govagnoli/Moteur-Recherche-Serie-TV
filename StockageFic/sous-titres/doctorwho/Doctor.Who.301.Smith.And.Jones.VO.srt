1
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:42,620
RAP: What can happen on the
average beautiful day ?

3
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:44,300
You never know

4
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:47,580
Celebrate seasonal changes...

5
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:50,700
MOBILE RINGS

6
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:52,620
You're up early ! What's happening ?

7
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:56,140
It's a nightmare, cos Dad
won't listen, Mum is going mental.

8
00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:58,740
Martha, this is epic.
You've gotta stop him.

9
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:01,860
How do I do that ?
Tell Dad he can't bring her.
PHONE BEEPS

10
00:01:01,906 --> 00:01:03,780
That's Leo, I'll call you back.

11
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:07,625
Martha, if Mum and Dad kick off,
tell 'em I don't even want a party.

12
00:01:07,666 --> 00:01:10,820
I didn't ask for one. They can
always give me the money instead.

13
00:01:10,864 --> 00:01:13,347
Why do I have to tell them ?
Hold on, that's Mum.

14
00:01:13,389 --> 00:01:15,223
I'll call you back.

15
00:01:15,266 --> 00:01:18,623
I don't mind your father making
a fool of himself in private,

16
00:01:18,668 --> 00:01:22,502
but this is Leo's 21st -
everyone is going to be there,

17
00:01:22,546 --> 00:01:24,860
and the entire family
will look ridiculous.

18
00:01:24,906 --> 00:01:28,342
Mum, it's a party ! I can't stop Dad
from bringing his girlfriend.

19
00:01:28,386 --> 00:01:31,941
Hold on, that's Dad.
I'll call you back. Ohh !

20
00:01:31,988 --> 00:01:35,862
Martha ? Now, tell your mother.
Leo is my son,

21
00:01:35,908 --> 00:01:39,142
AND I'm paying for half that party.

22
00:01:39,185 --> 00:01:41,342
I'm entitled to bring who I like.

23
00:01:41,385 --> 00:01:44,460
What will it look like for Mum
if you're there with Annalise ?

24
00:01:44,506 --> 00:01:46,101
What's wrong with Annalise ?

25
00:01:46,146 --> 00:01:48,860
Is that Martha ? Say hi !

26
00:01:48,908 --> 00:01:51,902
Hi, Martha ! Hiii !
Hiii, Annalise...

27
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:54,541
Big kiss ! Lots of love !
See you at the party, babes !

28
00:01:54,588 --> 00:01:56,982
Now take me shopping, big boy.

29
00:01:59,666 --> 00:02:03,500
Like so ! You see ?

30
00:02:19,586 --> 00:02:21,542
Oi ! Watch it, mate !

31
00:02:45,667 --> 00:02:48,941
I was all right till this morning
and then, I don't know,

32
00:02:48,986 --> 00:02:51,062
I woke up
and I felt all dizzy again.

33
00:02:51,108 --> 00:02:53,420
It was worse than when I came in.

34
00:02:53,467 --> 00:02:55,260
Pulse is slightly thready.

35
00:02:55,308 --> 00:02:58,103
Well, let's see what Britain's
finest might suggest.

36
00:02:58,147 --> 00:02:59,461
Any ideas, Morgenstern ?

37
00:02:59,505 --> 00:03:03,101
Er, dizziness could be a sign
of early-onset diabetes.

38
00:03:03,145 --> 00:03:07,582
Hardly early onset, if you'll
forgive me, Miss Finnegan.
Any more ideas ? Swales ?

39
00:03:07,626 --> 00:03:10,500
Erm, could recommend a CT scan.

40
00:03:10,546 --> 00:03:12,942
And spend all our money ? Jones ?

41
00:03:12,985 --> 00:03:15,780
We could take bloods and
check for Meniere's disease.

42
00:03:15,827 --> 00:03:17,543
Or we could just ask the patient.

43
00:03:17,585 --> 00:03:20,582
What did you have for dinner
last night ?

44
00:03:20,627 --> 00:03:24,260
I had salad. And the night before ?
Salad again.

45
00:03:24,306 --> 00:03:29,901
And salad every night for the past
week, contrary to my instructions.

46
00:03:29,948 --> 00:03:34,821
Salt deficiency, that's all.
Simple, honest salt.

47
00:03:34,865 --> 00:03:38,621
Hippocrates himself expounded
on the virtues of salt.

48
00:03:38,667 --> 00:03:41,821
Recommended the inhalation
of steam from sea water.

49
00:03:41,867 --> 00:03:44,860
Though no doubt, if he'd been
afflicted with my students,

50
00:03:44,905 --> 00:03:47,743
his oaths might have been
rather more colourful.

51
00:03:54,266 --> 00:03:57,340
Now then, Mr Smith, good morning
to you. How are you today ?

52
00:03:57,388 --> 00:04:00,303
Oh, not so bad.
Still a bit, y'know, bleuch.

53
00:04:00,346 --> 00:04:04,143
John Smith, admitted yesterday
with severe abdominal pains. Jones ?

54
00:04:04,185 --> 00:04:06,583
Why don't you see
what you can find ? Amaze me.

55
00:04:06,626 --> 00:04:10,861
Well, it wasn't very clever running
round outside, was it ? Sorry ?

56
00:04:10,905 --> 00:04:14,340
On Chancellor Street ? You came up to
me and took your tie off. Really ?

57
00:04:14,387 --> 00:04:16,181
What did I do that for ?

58
00:04:16,225 --> 00:04:20,703
I don't know. You just did. Not me.
I was here in bed. Ask the nurses.

59
00:04:20,747 --> 00:04:23,860
That's weird, cos it looked like
you. Have you got a brother ?

60
00:04:23,906 --> 00:04:25,783
No, not any more. Just me.

61
00:04:25,826 --> 00:04:29,940
As time passes and I grow ever more
infirm and weary, Miss Jones ?

62
00:04:29,985 --> 00:04:31,942
Sorry.

63
00:04:31,988 --> 00:04:34,420
Right...

64
00:04:34,466 --> 00:04:36,580
HEART BEATS

65
00:04:39,028 --> 00:04:41,740
HEART BEATS

66
00:04:41,785 --> 00:04:44,142
I weep for future generations.

67
00:04:44,188 --> 00:04:46,700
Are you having trouble
locating the heart ?

68
00:04:46,746 --> 00:04:49,781
Erm, I don't know.

69
00:04:49,828 --> 00:04:54,263
Stomach cramps ?
That is a symptom, not a diagnosis.

70
00:04:54,308 --> 00:04:59,903
And you rather failed basic
techniques by not consulting first
with the patient's chart.

71
00:05:01,665 --> 00:05:04,622
That happened to me this morning.
I had the same thing.

72
00:05:04,667 --> 00:05:07,543
And me, in the lift.
Well, it's only to be expected.

73
00:05:07,585 --> 00:05:10,143
There's a thunderstorm moving in,
and lightning

74
00:05:10,187 --> 00:05:13,581
is a form of static electricity,
as was first proven by...

75
00:05:13,626 --> 00:05:16,140
Anyone ? Benjamin Franklin.

76
00:05:16,185 --> 00:05:17,862
Correct.

77
00:05:17,905 --> 00:05:21,902
My mate Ben ! That was a day.
I got rope burns off that kite.
And I got soaked.

78
00:05:21,948 --> 00:05:24,061
Quite. And then I got electrocuted !

79
00:05:24,107 --> 00:05:28,782
Moving on... I think perhaps
a visit from Psychiatric.

80
00:05:28,826 --> 00:05:31,863
And next we have Mr...

81
00:05:35,588 --> 00:05:37,781
No, listen, I've worked out a plan.

82
00:05:37,826 --> 00:05:41,863
We tell Annalise that the buffet
tonight is 100% carbohydrate

83
00:05:41,907 --> 00:05:43,381
and she won't turn up !

84
00:05:43,426 --> 00:05:47,823
Take this seriously. That's
our inheritance she's spending.
On fake tan !

85
00:05:47,866 --> 00:05:49,663
I'm not far away, let's meet up.

86
00:05:49,705 --> 00:05:51,423
We can draw up a battle plan.

87
00:05:51,466 --> 00:05:55,620
In this weather ? I'm not going out.
It's pouring. It's not raining here.

88
00:05:59,225 --> 00:06:01,102
God, that's weird.

89
00:06:01,148 --> 00:06:06,223
It's raining right on top of you. I
can see it, but it's dry where I am.
Well, you just got lucky.

90
00:06:06,267 --> 00:06:09,181
It's like in cartoons,
when a man's got a cloud over him.

91
00:06:09,226 --> 00:06:10,941
I'll tell you what we'll do.

92
00:06:14,227 --> 00:06:17,381
We tell Dad and Annalise
to get there early, about 7:30,

93
00:06:17,425 --> 00:06:21,381
and we tell Leo to get there at the
same time to do that birthday stuff.

94
00:06:21,427 --> 00:06:23,582
We tell Mum to get there
for about 8:30, 9,

95
00:06:23,627 --> 00:06:28,261
then that gives me time to have
a word with Annalise, and... What ?

96
00:06:28,308 --> 00:06:30,580
The rain. It's only rain.

97
00:06:30,627 --> 00:06:32,781
Martha, have you seen the rain ?

98
00:06:32,825 --> 00:06:34,903
Why's everyone fussing about rain ?

99
00:06:34,945 --> 00:06:38,341
It's going up. The rain is going up.

100
00:06:47,906 --> 00:06:51,261
THUNDER CLAPS, GLASS SMASHES

101
00:07:09,385 --> 00:07:12,981
What the hell was that ?
Are you all right ?

102
00:07:13,027 --> 00:07:14,982
I think so, yeah.

103
00:07:15,025 --> 00:07:19,343
It felt like an earthquake, or...  ?
Martha !

104
00:07:19,388 --> 00:07:21,581
It's night.

105
00:07:23,107 --> 00:07:25,103
But it was lunchtime.

106
00:07:25,146 --> 00:07:28,142
It's not night. But it's got to be.

107
00:07:28,185 --> 00:07:30,660
It's dark.

108
00:07:30,806 --> 00:07:32,302
We're on the moon.

109
00:07:32,347 --> 00:07:36,821
Can't be ! We're on the moon.

110
00:07:36,868 --> 00:07:40,063
We're on the bloody moon !

111
00:08:03,387 --> 00:08:05,422
THEY ALL SCREAM

112
00:08:19,587 --> 00:08:23,420
I'm sorry, miss, no. My God.

113
00:08:33,505 --> 00:08:35,543
Martha ? Martha, can you hear me ?

114
00:08:36,545 --> 00:08:38,863
Martha ?

115
00:08:43,987 --> 00:08:45,502
Somebody help me !

116
00:09:01,068 --> 00:09:04,461
Have you seen Mr Stoker ?
I'm sorry, I can't.

117
00:09:06,867 --> 00:09:12,782
All right, now, everyone,
back to bed. We've got an emergency,
but we'll sort it out, don't worry.

118
00:09:12,827 --> 00:09:17,981
It's real. It's really real !

119
00:09:18,025 --> 00:09:21,182
Hold on.
Don't ! We'll lose all the air !

120
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:26,900
They're not airtight. If the air was
gonna get sucked out, it would have
done. But it didn't, so how come ?

121
00:09:26,948 --> 00:09:30,062
Very good point ! Brilliant, in fact.
What was your name ?

122
00:09:30,107 --> 00:09:32,983
Martha. And it was Jones, wasn't it ?

123
00:09:33,028 --> 00:09:36,143
Well, Martha Jones, question is,
how are we breathing ?

124
00:09:36,185 --> 00:09:38,182
We can't be !
We are, don't waste my time.

125
00:09:38,225 --> 00:09:41,463
Martha, is there a balcony on
this floor, or a veranda, or...  ?

126
00:09:41,507 --> 00:09:45,141
By the patients' lounge, yeah.
Do you fancy going out ?

127
00:09:45,188 --> 00:09:47,420
OK. We might die.

128
00:09:47,466 --> 00:09:49,023
We might not.

129
00:09:49,068 --> 00:09:51,101
Good ! Come on.

130
00:09:51,147 --> 00:09:53,140
Not her, she'd hold us up.

131
00:10:18,748 --> 00:10:20,262
We've got air !

132
00:10:22,068 --> 00:10:24,140
How does that work ?

133
00:10:24,186 --> 00:10:26,702
Just be glad it does.

134
00:10:32,988 --> 00:10:35,221
I've got a party tonight.

135
00:10:35,266 --> 00:10:37,741
It's my brother's 21st.

136
00:10:37,785 --> 00:10:41,382
My mother's gonna be really...

137
00:10:41,426 --> 00:10:44,983
really... You OK ? Yeah.

138
00:10:45,027 --> 00:10:48,223
Sure ? Yeah.
D'you want to go back in ? No way.

139
00:10:48,266 --> 00:10:50,503
We could die any minute,
but all the same...

140
00:10:50,547 --> 00:10:52,383
It's beautiful.

141
00:10:52,427 --> 00:10:56,062
D'you think ? How many people
want to go to the moon ?

142
00:10:56,105 --> 00:10:57,741
And here we are.

143
00:10:57,785 --> 00:11:00,900
Standing in the Earthlight.

144
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:03,345
What do you think happened ?

145
00:11:03,386 --> 00:11:07,900
What do you think ? Extraterrestrial.

146
00:11:07,944 --> 00:11:10,187
It's got to be.
I dunno, a few years ago

147
00:11:10,229 --> 00:11:12,941
that would've sounded mad,
but these days...

148
00:11:12,986 --> 00:11:15,223
That spaceship flying into Big Ben.

149
00:11:15,268 --> 00:11:18,582
Christmas. Those Cybermen things.

150
00:11:20,947 --> 00:11:22,780
I had a cousin.

151
00:11:22,825 --> 00:11:24,781
Adeola.

152
00:11:24,827 --> 00:11:27,702
She worked at Canary Wharf.

153
00:11:27,748 --> 00:11:29,261
She never came home.

154
00:11:31,147 --> 00:11:32,702
I'm sorry.

155
00:11:32,746 --> 00:11:35,500
Yeah.

156
00:11:35,545 --> 00:11:37,503
I was there,

157
00:11:37,546 --> 00:11:40,860
in the battle. They were...

158
00:11:44,428 --> 00:11:47,261
I promise you, Mr Smith,
we will find a way out.

159
00:11:47,308 --> 00:11:49,742
If we can travel to the moon,
we can travel back.

160
00:11:49,787 --> 00:11:51,701
There must be a way.
It's not Smith.

161
00:11:51,747 --> 00:11:53,980
That's not my real name.
Who are you, then ?

162
00:11:54,028 --> 00:11:55,582
I'm the Doctor.

163
00:11:55,627 --> 00:11:58,143
Me too, if I ever pass my exams.

164
00:11:58,188 --> 00:12:00,023
What is it, then - Dr Smith ?

165
00:12:00,066 --> 00:12:03,500
Just the Doctor.
How do you mean, "Just the Doctor" ?

166
00:12:03,546 --> 00:12:07,142
Just the Doctor.
What, people call you "the Doctor" ?

167
00:12:07,186 --> 00:12:09,543
Yeah. Well, I'm not.

168
00:12:09,588 --> 00:12:12,380
Far as I'm concerned,
you've got to earn that title.

169
00:12:12,426 --> 00:12:14,902
I'd better make a start, then.
Let's have a look,

170
00:12:14,947 --> 00:12:16,823
there must be some sort of...

171
00:12:20,585 --> 00:12:24,062
 .forcefield keeping the air in.

172
00:12:24,107 --> 00:12:29,863
But if that's like a bubble,
sealing us in, that means
this is the only air we've got.

173
00:12:29,905 --> 00:12:32,862
What happens when it runs out ?
How many people here ?

174
00:12:32,905 --> 00:12:34,461
Dunno, a thousand ?

175
00:12:34,508 --> 00:12:37,821
One thousand people suffocating.

176
00:12:37,868 --> 00:12:40,581
Why would anyone do that ?
ENGINES ROAR

177
00:12:40,628 --> 00:12:43,381
Heads up ! Ask 'em yourself.

178
00:13:42,427 --> 00:13:44,982
Aliens.

179
00:13:45,026 --> 00:13:49,621
That's aliens. Real, proper aliens.

180
00:13:49,667 --> 00:13:51,143
Judoon.

181
00:14:07,665 --> 00:14:08,940
Mr Stoker ?

182
00:14:08,987 --> 00:14:13,263
I'm sorry, I didn't know who else
to ask. But can you help me ?

183
00:14:13,306 --> 00:14:15,943
I think we've gone
beyond aspirin, Miss, er...  ?

184
00:14:15,985 --> 00:14:18,102
Finnegan. Names !

185
00:14:18,148 --> 00:14:21,861
What are names now, when something
unnameable is marching towards us ?

186
00:14:21,906 --> 00:14:25,943
Two more years, I thought, two more
years, and then retire to Florida.

187
00:14:25,987 --> 00:14:27,582
But there is Florida, in the sky.

188
00:14:27,626 --> 00:14:31,663
I can see it ! My daughter -

189
00:14:31,705 --> 00:14:33,220
she's still in university.

190
00:14:33,268 --> 00:14:34,943
I am never going to see her again.

191
00:14:34,985 --> 00:14:37,180
But I need help, Mr Stoker.

192
00:14:37,225 --> 00:14:40,981
I can't do anything !
Oh, I think you can.

193
00:14:41,025 --> 00:14:44,741
What do you two want ? It's a bit
late to sign for anything.

194
00:14:44,788 --> 00:14:46,942
These are my lovely boys.

195
00:14:46,988 --> 00:14:48,980
I prefer not to get my hands dirty.

196
00:14:49,028 --> 00:14:52,380
I'm sorry ? You see,
there are great tests to come,

197
00:14:52,426 --> 00:14:55,222
and terrible deeds,
some of them my own.

198
00:14:55,265 --> 00:14:58,943
But if I'm to survive this,
I need you.

199
00:14:58,988 --> 00:15:00,823
What are you talking about ? Blood.

200
00:15:00,866 --> 00:15:03,863
Specifically, yours.

201
00:15:03,907 --> 00:15:06,702
What are you doing ?

202
00:15:06,748 --> 00:15:10,063
What are you doing ?
Let go of me ! What the hell ? Let go !

203
00:15:10,105 --> 00:15:15,140
You see, I was only salt-deficient
because I'm so very good
at absorbing it.

204
00:15:15,187 --> 00:15:17,661
But now I need fire in my veins.

205
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:22,142
And who better than a consultant,
with blood full

206
00:15:22,188 --> 00:15:28,221
of salty fats and vintage wines and
all those Michelin-star sauces ?

207
00:15:28,266 --> 00:15:32,700
Who are you ?
Oh, I'm a survivor, Mr Stoker.

208
00:15:32,745 --> 00:15:36,583
At any cost. Look !

209
00:15:38,905 --> 00:15:42,262
I've even brought a straw.

210
00:15:49,987 --> 00:15:52,740
THEY MUTTER IN ALARM

211
00:16:35,065 --> 00:16:37,500
Bo ! Sco ! Fo ! Do !

212
00:16:37,545 --> 00:16:39,622
No ! Kro ! Blo ! Co ! Sho ! Ro !

213
00:16:45,545 --> 00:16:48,222
Erm, we are citizens of planet Earth.

214
00:16:48,267 --> 00:16:49,980
We welcome you in peace.

215
00:16:50,025 --> 00:16:51,582
IT GRUNTS

216
00:16:53,588 --> 00:16:55,143
P-Please don't hurt me.

217
00:16:55,188 --> 00:16:59,062
I was just trying to help. I'm sorry.
Don't hurt me, please don't hurt me.

218
00:16:59,107 --> 00:17:02,542
ON DEVICE: 'P-Please don't hurt me.
I was just trying to help.

219
00:17:02,588 --> 00:17:05,580
'I'm sorry. Don't hurt me.'
Language assimilated.

220
00:17:05,627 --> 00:17:08,420
Designation: Earth English.

221
00:17:08,465 --> 00:17:11,222
You will be catalogued.

222
00:17:11,268 --> 00:17:13,663
Category: human.

223
00:17:18,867 --> 00:17:21,302
Catalogue all suspects.

224
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:34,701
Aw, look, you've got a little shop !
I like a little shop.

225
00:17:34,745 --> 00:17:37,303
Never mind that ! What are Judoon ?

226
00:17:37,348 --> 00:17:39,343
They're like police. Well...

227
00:17:39,385 --> 00:17:42,143
Police for hire.
More like interplanetary thugs.

228
00:17:42,186 --> 00:17:44,860
And they brought us to the moon ?
Neutral territory.

229
00:17:44,908 --> 00:17:48,621
According to Galactic Law, they've
got no jurisdiction over the Earth.

230
00:17:48,667 --> 00:17:53,181
That rain and lightning ?
That was them using an H2O Scoop.

231
00:17:53,227 --> 00:17:57,341
What are you on about, "Galactic
Law" ? Where d'you get that from ?

232
00:18:00,785 --> 00:18:04,540
Human. If they're police,
are we under arrest ?

233
00:18:04,586 --> 00:18:08,343
Are we trespassing on the moon ?
No, but I like that ! Good thinking.

234
00:18:08,385 --> 00:18:12,063
No, wish it were that simple.
They're making a catalogue.

235
00:18:12,108 --> 00:18:16,380
That means they're after something
non-human, which is bad news for me.
Why ?

236
00:18:18,988 --> 00:18:20,941
Oh, you're kidding me.

237
00:18:20,987 --> 00:18:23,463
Don't be ridiculous.

238
00:18:24,947 --> 00:18:27,980
Stop looking at me like that.
Come on, then.

239
00:18:31,428 --> 00:18:35,220
Troop Five, floor one !
Troop Six, floor two !

240
00:18:35,265 --> 00:18:39,541
Identify humans
and find the transgressor ! Find it !

241
00:18:50,666 --> 00:18:54,981
Prepare to be catalogued !
Do what they say ! All they do
is shine this light thing.

242
00:18:55,026 --> 00:18:57,423
They're not going to hurt us.
Listen to them.

243
00:19:03,588 --> 00:19:05,861
Witness the crime.

244
00:19:05,906 --> 00:19:08,501
Charge: physical assault.

245
00:19:08,545 --> 00:19:11,822
Plea: guilty. Sentence: execution.

246
00:19:16,946 --> 00:19:19,060
You didn't have to do that.

247
00:19:19,106 --> 00:19:20,860
Justice is swift.

248
00:19:26,745 --> 00:19:28,460
They've reached the third floor.

249
00:19:28,505 --> 00:19:30,822
What's that thing ?
Sonic screwdriver.

250
00:19:30,868 --> 00:19:32,781
Well, if you won't answer
properly...

251
00:19:32,827 --> 00:19:36,663
No, really, it is ! It's a
screwdriver. And it's sonic. Look.

252
00:19:36,708 --> 00:19:39,861
What else have you got ?
A laser spanner ?

253
00:19:39,907 --> 00:19:42,580
No, it was stolen by Emily Pankhurst,
cheeky woman.

254
00:19:42,628 --> 00:19:45,102
What's wrong with this computer ?  !

255
00:19:45,145 --> 00:19:47,782
Judoon must have locked it down.

256
00:19:47,828 --> 00:19:50,701
Judoon platoon upon the moon.

257
00:19:50,748 --> 00:19:54,423
I was just travelling past, I swear.
I wasn't looking for trouble.

258
00:19:54,467 --> 00:19:57,180
I noticed these plasma coils
around the hospital.

259
00:19:57,226 --> 00:19:59,703
It's been building up
for two days now.

260
00:19:59,745 --> 00:20:01,940
So I thought something was going on
inside.

261
00:20:01,986 --> 00:20:04,023
Turns out it was the Judoon up above.

262
00:20:04,068 --> 00:20:07,383
What are they looking for ?
Something that looks human but isn't.

263
00:20:07,428 --> 00:20:09,863
Like you. Apparently. Like me.

264
00:20:09,907 --> 00:20:13,790
But not me. Haven't they got a photo ?
Might be a shape-changer.

265
00:20:13,866 --> 00:20:16,980
Whatever it is, can't you just
leave the Judoon to find it ?

266
00:20:17,026 --> 00:20:20,981
If they find the hospital guilty
of harbouring a fugitive,
they'll execute it.

267
00:20:21,028 --> 00:20:24,540
All of us ? Oh, yes.
But if I can find this thing first...

268
00:20:24,588 --> 00:20:27,143
Oh ! See ?  ! They're thick !
Judoon are thick.

269
00:20:27,188 --> 00:20:29,143
So thick, they've wiped the records !

270
00:20:29,185 --> 00:20:32,063
Oh, that's clever.
What are we looking for ? Don't know.

271
00:20:32,107 --> 00:20:36,063
Say, any patient admitted
with unusual symptoms.
Maybe there's a backup...

272
00:20:36,105 --> 00:20:39,260
Just keep working. I'll go and
ask Mr Stoker. He might know.

273
00:20:45,868 --> 00:20:48,381
Mr Stoker ?

274
00:20:55,545 --> 00:20:56,623
Kill her !

275
00:20:58,828 --> 00:21:02,060
I've restored the backup.
I found her ! You did what ?

276
00:21:02,108 --> 00:21:03,383
Run !

277
00:21:50,708 --> 00:21:52,620
When I say "Now," press the button.

278
00:21:52,665 --> 00:21:55,262
But I don't know which one !
Then find out !

279
00:22:10,786 --> 00:22:12,260
NOW !

280
00:22:23,108 --> 00:22:25,341
What did you do ?

281
00:22:25,385 --> 00:22:29,343
Increased the radiation by 5, 000%.
Killed him dead.

282
00:22:29,385 --> 00:22:32,863
But isn't that gonna kill you ?
Nah, it's only Rontgen radiation.

283
00:22:32,907 --> 00:22:34,783
We used to play with Rontgen bricks.

284
00:22:34,828 --> 00:22:37,700
It's safe for you to come out.
I've absorbed it all.

285
00:22:37,748 --> 00:22:40,700
All I need to do is expel it.

286
00:22:40,748 --> 00:22:44,220
If I concentrate,

287
00:22:44,265 --> 00:22:49,420
shift the radiation out of my body
and into one spot -

288
00:22:49,466 --> 00:22:51,380
say, my left shoe.

289
00:22:51,425 --> 00:22:54,381
Here we go. Here we go. Easy does it !

290
00:22:54,425 --> 00:22:57,020
Out, out, out, out,

291
00:22:57,068 --> 00:23:02,383
out, out out, ow, ah, itches,
itches, itches, itches !

292
00:23:04,746 --> 00:23:07,823
Done ! You're completely mad.

293
00:23:07,866 --> 00:23:10,101
You're right.
I look daft with one shoe.

294
00:23:13,105 --> 00:23:15,383
Barefoot on the moon !

295
00:23:16,626 --> 00:23:17,701
What is that thing ?

296
00:23:17,745 --> 00:23:21,340
Where's it from, the Planet Zovirax ?
Just a Slab.

297
00:23:21,385 --> 00:23:23,423
They're called Slabs.

298
00:23:23,467 --> 00:23:27,101
Basic slave drones, you see.
Solid leather all the way through.

299
00:23:27,148 --> 00:23:29,621
Someone has got one hell of a fetish.

300
00:23:29,665 --> 00:23:31,740
But it was that woman,
Miss Finnegan.

301
00:23:31,788 --> 00:23:34,581
It was working for her,
just like a servant.

302
00:23:34,626 --> 00:23:38,661
My sonic screwdriver !
She was a patient...
Burnt out my sonic screwdriver !

303
00:23:38,708 --> 00:23:41,183
She had this straw,
like some sort of vampire.

304
00:23:41,226 --> 00:23:43,900
I love my sonic screwdriver !
Doctor !

305
00:23:43,945 --> 00:23:45,860
Sorry.

306
00:23:45,905 --> 00:23:48,420
You called me Doctor. Anyway !

307
00:23:48,465 --> 00:23:50,102
Miss Finnegan is the alien.

308
00:23:50,145 --> 00:23:52,180
She was drinking Mr Stoker's blood.

309
00:23:52,228 --> 00:23:55,700
Funny time to take a snack.
You'd think she'd be hiding.

310
00:23:55,747 --> 00:23:58,701
Unless... No ?

311
00:23:58,745 --> 00:24:01,060
Yes ! That's it ! Wait a minute.

312
00:24:01,105 --> 00:24:03,141
YES ! Internal shape-changer !

313
00:24:03,188 --> 00:24:06,061
She wasn't drinking blood,
she was assimilating it.

314
00:24:08,788 --> 00:24:10,623
Prepare to be catalogued !

315
00:24:16,186 --> 00:24:17,662
Human.

316
00:24:21,987 --> 00:24:26,581
If she can assimilate Mr Stoker's
blood, mimic the biology,
she'll register as human !

317
00:24:26,627 --> 00:24:29,781
We've got to find her
and show the Judoon. Come on !

318
00:24:29,828 --> 00:24:30,862
Human.

319
00:24:53,026 --> 00:24:56,862
That's the thing about Slabs -
they always travel in pairs.

320
00:24:56,906 --> 00:24:59,220
What about you ? What about me what ?

321
00:24:59,268 --> 00:25:03,902
Well, haven't you got backup ? You
must have a partner or something.

322
00:25:06,667 --> 00:25:12,141
Humans ! We're on the moon, with
Judoon and a bloodsucking criminal,
and you ask personal questions ?  !

323
00:25:12,185 --> 00:25:16,502
I like that - "Humans" ( !) I'm
still not convinced you're an alien.

324
00:25:17,986 --> 00:25:19,501
Non-human !

325
00:25:19,546 --> 00:25:22,301
Oh, my God, you really are !
And again.

326
00:25:40,508 --> 00:25:42,103
They've done this floor.

327
00:25:42,146 --> 00:25:43,741
Come on.

328
00:25:43,787 --> 00:25:47,342
The Judoon are logical
and just a little bit thick.

329
00:25:47,387 --> 00:25:51,021
They won't check a floor they've
checked already. If we're lucky.

330
00:25:51,065 --> 00:25:52,622
How much oxygen is there ?

331
00:25:52,665 --> 00:25:54,301
Not enough for all these people.

332
00:25:54,345 --> 00:25:57,980
We're gonna run out.
How you feeling ? You all right ?

333
00:25:58,026 --> 00:25:59,781
Running on adrenaline.

334
00:25:59,826 --> 00:26:02,261
Welcome to my world.
What about the Judoon ?

335
00:26:02,308 --> 00:26:06,341
Big lung reserves. Won't slow them
down. Where's Mr Stoker's office ?

336
00:26:06,385 --> 00:26:07,620
It's this way.

337
00:26:15,547 --> 00:26:17,580
She's gone !

338
00:26:17,627 --> 00:26:19,180
She was here.

339
00:26:20,907 --> 00:26:22,541
Drained him dry.

340
00:26:22,586 --> 00:26:25,541
Every last drop.
I was right, she's a Plasmavore.

341
00:26:25,588 --> 00:26:27,261
Then what's she doing on Earth ?

342
00:26:27,307 --> 00:26:29,780
Hiding. On the run,

343
00:26:29,826 --> 00:26:31,742
like Ronald Biggs in Rio de Janeiro.

344
00:26:31,787 --> 00:26:34,060
What's she doing now ?
She's still not safe.

345
00:26:34,107 --> 00:26:37,381
The Judoon could execute us all.
Come on. Wait a minute.

346
00:26:47,146 --> 00:26:52,063
Think, think, think. If I was
a wanted Plasmavore surrounded
by police, what would I do ?

347
00:26:52,108 --> 00:26:54,502
Ohh...

348
00:26:54,545 --> 00:26:56,420
She's as clever as me.

349
00:26:56,465 --> 00:26:58,460
Almost.

350
00:26:58,507 --> 00:27:00,943
Find the non-human ! Execute !

351
00:27:00,988 --> 00:27:03,023
Stay here.
You've got to hold them up.

352
00:27:03,105 --> 00:27:04,943
How do I do that ?
Just... Forgive me.

353
00:27:04,988 --> 00:27:08,261
It could save a thousand lives.
It means nothing. Honestly.

354
00:27:16,745 --> 00:27:18,823
That was nothing ?

355
00:27:43,305 --> 00:27:45,101
Have you seen ? !

356
00:27:45,148 --> 00:27:49,341
There are these things,
these great big space rhino things.

357
00:27:49,388 --> 00:27:52,622
I mean, rhinos from space ?  !
And we're on the moon !

358
00:27:52,667 --> 00:27:54,982
Great big space rhinos
with guns on the moon !

359
00:27:55,025 --> 00:27:59,660
I only came in for my bunions ! Look !
All fixed now. Good treatment.
The nurses were lovely.

360
00:27:59,708 --> 00:28:03,782
I'd recommend this place to anyone,
but then we end up on the moon !

361
00:28:03,825 --> 00:28:07,103
Did I mention the rhinos ?  ! Hold him.

362
00:28:10,386 --> 00:28:13,580
Find the non-human ! Execute !

363
00:28:19,147 --> 00:28:21,862
Now listen.
I know who you're looking for.

364
00:28:21,908 --> 00:28:25,820
She's this woman.
She calls herself Florence.

365
00:28:25,865 --> 00:28:29,022
Human. Wait !
Non-human trace suspected !

366
00:28:29,066 --> 00:28:31,703
Non-human element confirmed !

367
00:28:31,747 --> 00:28:34,301
Authorise full scan !

368
00:28:36,306 --> 00:28:40,141
What are you ? What are you ?

369
00:28:40,187 --> 00:28:44,181
Um, that big, erm, machine thing - is
it supposed to be making that noise ?

370
00:28:44,228 --> 00:28:49,383
You wouldn't understand.
But isn't that a magnetic
resonance imaging thing ?

371
00:28:49,428 --> 00:28:52,343
Like a ginormous sort of a magnet ?
I did Magnetics GCSE.

372
00:28:52,388 --> 00:28:54,140
Well, I failed, but all the same...

373
00:28:54,185 --> 00:28:58,140
A magnet with its setting
now increased to 50,000 tesla.

374
00:28:58,187 --> 00:29:00,582
Ooh, that's a bit strong. Isn't it ?

375
00:29:00,625 --> 00:29:04,341
It'll send out a magnetic pulse
that'll fry the brain stems

376
00:29:04,385 --> 00:29:07,380
of every living thing
within 250, 000 miles.

377
00:29:07,428 --> 00:29:10,900
Except for me. Safe in this room.

378
00:29:10,946 --> 00:29:14,742
But hold on, hold on. I did
Geography GCSE. I passed that one.

379
00:29:14,786 --> 00:29:18,541
Doesn't that distance include the
Earth ? Only the side facing the moon.

380
00:29:18,586 --> 00:29:21,100
The other half will survive.
Call it my gift.

381
00:29:21,147 --> 00:29:23,222
Sorry,
I'm a little bit out of my depth.

382
00:29:23,265 --> 00:29:27,542
I've spent 15 years working
as a postman. Hence the bunion.
Why would you do that ?

383
00:29:27,587 --> 00:29:31,700
With everyone dead, the Judoon ships
will be mine to make my escape.

384
00:29:31,745 --> 00:29:34,701
That's weird. You talk like
you're some sort of an alien.

385
00:29:34,746 --> 00:29:36,220
Quite so.

386
00:29:36,268 --> 00:29:38,022
No ? ! Oh, yes. You're joshing me.

387
00:29:38,068 --> 00:29:40,900
I am not. I'm talking to an alien ?

388
00:29:40,945 --> 00:29:42,821
In hospital ?

389
00:29:42,865 --> 00:29:45,780
Has it got an ET department ?
It's a perfect hiding place.

390
00:29:45,825 --> 00:29:48,303
Blood banks downstairs
for a midnight feast.

391
00:29:48,346 --> 00:29:53,101
And all this equipment,
ready to arm myself with,
should the police come looking.

392
00:29:53,147 --> 00:29:55,261
So those rhinos are looking for you !

393
00:29:55,308 --> 00:29:59,101
Yes. But I'm hidden.

394
00:29:59,148 --> 00:30:02,660
Oh, right.

395
00:30:02,708 --> 00:30:05,940
Maybe that's why they're increasing
their scans. What ?

396
00:30:05,986 --> 00:30:11,702
Big Chief Rhino boy, he said,
no sign of a non-human, we must
increase our scans up to setting two ?

397
00:30:11,745 --> 00:30:13,222
I must assimilate again.

398
00:30:13,267 --> 00:30:16,261
What does that mean ?
I must appear to be human.

399
00:30:16,307 --> 00:30:19,582
You're welcome to come home and meet
the wife, she'd be honoured.

400
00:30:19,627 --> 00:30:22,300
We can have cake !
Why should I have cake ?

401
00:30:22,345 --> 00:30:24,302
I've got my little straw.

402
00:30:24,348 --> 00:30:27,982
That's nice.
Milkshake ? I like banana.

403
00:30:28,026 --> 00:30:29,500
You're quite the funny man.

404
00:30:29,545 --> 00:30:32,223
And yet, I think,
laughing on purpose.

405
00:30:32,265 --> 00:30:34,260
At the darkness.

406
00:30:34,307 --> 00:30:37,022
I think it's time
you found some peace. Steady him !

407
00:30:40,668 --> 00:30:42,302
What are you doing ?

408
00:30:42,346 --> 00:30:44,820
I'm afraid this is going to hurt.

409
00:30:44,867 --> 00:30:49,662
But if it's any consolation,
the dead don't tend to remember.

410
00:30:51,585 --> 00:30:53,180
Confirm human.

411
00:30:53,227 --> 00:30:56,380
Traces of facial contact
with non-human.

412
00:30:56,427 --> 00:30:58,021
Continue the search !

413
00:30:58,066 --> 00:31:00,262
You will need this. What's that for ?

414
00:31:00,306 --> 00:31:01,903
Compensation.

415
00:31:18,866 --> 00:31:22,262
Now see what you've done !
This poor man just died of fright.

416
00:31:22,307 --> 00:31:24,222
Scan him !

417
00:31:28,226 --> 00:31:29,822
Confirmation, deceased.

418
00:31:29,868 --> 00:31:33,061
No, he can't be.
Let me through, let me see him.

419
00:31:33,106 --> 00:31:35,342
Stop. Case closed. But it was her !

420
00:31:35,386 --> 00:31:39,101
She killed him, she did it,
she murdered him.

421
00:31:39,147 --> 00:31:42,662
Judoon have no authority
over human crime.

422
00:31:42,707 --> 00:31:45,820
But she's not human !
Oh, but I am, I've been catalogued.

423
00:31:45,868 --> 00:31:47,701
But she's not, she assim...

424
00:31:47,748 --> 00:31:49,221
Wait a minute.

425
00:31:49,268 --> 00:31:53,222
You drank his blood ?
The Doctor's blood !

426
00:31:55,348 --> 00:31:59,543
Oh, I don't mind, scan all you like.
Non-human !

427
00:31:59,587 --> 00:32:02,623
What ? Confirm analysis.

428
00:32:02,665 --> 00:32:05,703
Oh, but that's a mistake, surely.

429
00:32:05,745 --> 00:32:07,941
I'm human,
I'm as human as they come.

430
00:32:07,985 --> 00:32:09,783
He gave his life so they'd find you.

431
00:32:09,825 --> 00:32:12,301
Confirm, Plasmavore !

432
00:32:12,345 --> 00:32:16,861
Charged with the crime
of murdering the Child Princess
of Padrivole Regency Nine.

433
00:32:16,906 --> 00:32:18,661
Well, she deserved it !

434
00:32:18,705 --> 00:32:23,020
Those pink cheeks and those blonde
curls, and that simpering voice,

435
00:32:23,065 --> 00:32:26,183
she was begging for the bite
of a Plasmavore !

436
00:32:26,227 --> 00:32:29,703
Then you confess ?
Confess ? I'm proud of it !

437
00:32:29,747 --> 00:32:31,262
Slab, stop them !

438
00:32:36,988 --> 00:32:39,982
Verdict: guilty.
Sentence: execution !

439
00:32:43,426 --> 00:32:48,580
Enjoy your victory, Judoon.
Cos you're going to burn with me !

440
00:32:48,625 --> 00:32:50,062
Burn in hell !

441
00:32:57,145 --> 00:32:58,901
Case closed.

442
00:32:58,947 --> 00:33:00,900
But what did she mean, burn with me ?

443
00:33:00,948 --> 00:33:03,782
The scanner shouldn't do that,
she's done something.

444
00:33:07,667 --> 00:33:12,142
Scans detect lethal acceleration
of mono-magnetic pulse.

445
00:33:12,188 --> 00:33:15,020
Well, do something, stop it !

446
00:33:15,068 --> 00:33:17,622
Our jurisdiction has ended.

447
00:33:17,667 --> 00:33:19,380
Judoon will evacuate.

448
00:33:19,426 --> 00:33:21,662
You can't just leave it !
What's it gonna do ?

449
00:33:21,706 --> 00:33:25,302
All units withdraw !

450
00:33:37,265 --> 00:33:40,741
What about the air ?
We're running out of air.

451
00:33:51,186 --> 00:33:55,341
You can't go ! That thing's gonna
explode, and it's your fault !

452
00:34:03,266 --> 00:34:06,821
One, two, three, four, five.

453
00:34:06,865 --> 00:34:10,181
One, two, three, four, five...

454
00:34:11,628 --> 00:34:13,580
Two hearts !

455
00:34:13,626 --> 00:34:21,900
One, two, three, four, five...
One, two, three, four, five...

456
00:34:35,587 --> 00:34:37,341
The scanner,

457
00:34:37,387 --> 00:34:40,140
she did something.

458
00:35:12,466 --> 00:35:14,542
The sonic !

459
00:36:08,265 --> 00:36:09,943
Come on, come on,

460
00:36:09,988 --> 00:36:11,780
come on, come on, please.

461
00:36:11,827 --> 00:36:14,142
Come on, Judoon, reverse it.

462
00:36:16,106 --> 00:36:20,262
It's raining, Martha.
It's raining on the moon.

463
00:36:20,306 --> 00:36:21,782
THUNDER CLAPS

464
00:36:41,788 --> 00:36:45,500
 .I represented the human race.

465
00:36:45,545 --> 00:36:49,303
I told them, "You can't do that,"
I said... Martha !

466
00:36:49,347 --> 00:36:52,861
Oh, my God, I thought you were dead,
what happened ?

467
00:36:52,908 --> 00:36:54,622
It was so weird !

468
00:36:54,665 --> 00:36:58,102
The police didn't have a clue, and
I tried phoning. Mum's on her way.

469
00:36:58,146 --> 00:37:00,460
But they've closed off
all the roads.

470
00:37:00,506 --> 00:37:02,980
There's thousands of people
trying to get in.

471
00:37:03,028 --> 00:37:06,142
Dad phoned. It's on the news
and everything, he was crying.

472
00:37:06,188 --> 00:37:09,182
Oh, my God, I've been a mess,
but what happened ?

473
00:37:09,228 --> 00:37:12,663
I mean, what really happened,
where were you ?

474
00:37:12,706 --> 00:37:16,063
'Eyewitness reports from the Royal
Hope Hospital are pouring in,

475
00:37:16,107 --> 00:37:18,382
'and all seem to be
remarkably consistent.

476
00:37:18,427 --> 00:37:21,861
'This from medical student
Oliver Morgenstern.

477
00:37:21,906 --> 00:37:27,863
'I was there, I saw it happen
and I feel uniquely privileged.

478
00:37:27,908 --> 00:37:30,543
'I looked out at the surface
of the moon.

479
00:37:30,586 --> 00:37:33,300
'I saw the Earth suspended in space,

480
00:37:33,346 --> 00:37:36,383
'and it all just proves
Mr Saxon right.

481
00:37:36,425 --> 00:37:38,540
'We're not alone in the Universe.

482
00:37:38,585 --> 00:37:42,421
'There's life out there.
Wild and extraordinary life.'

483
00:37:42,468 --> 00:37:45,381
I am not staying in there
to be insulted !

484
00:37:45,428 --> 00:37:48,341
She didn't mean it,
she just said you look healthy.

485
00:37:48,388 --> 00:37:52,261
No, I said orange !
Clive, she is disrespecting me !
She's never liked me !

486
00:37:52,307 --> 00:37:55,742
Oh, can't think why,
after you stole my husband !

487
00:37:55,785 --> 00:37:57,901
I was seduced ! Tell her, babes !

488
00:37:57,947 --> 00:38:01,943
And then she has a go at Martha,
accused her of making it all up.

489
00:38:01,988 --> 00:38:03,582
Mum, I don't mind, just leave it.

490
00:38:03,625 --> 00:38:05,343
Oh ! "I've been to the Moon !"

491
00:38:05,386 --> 00:38:08,421
As if. They were drugged,
it said so on the news !

492
00:38:08,466 --> 00:38:12,022
Since when did you watch the news ?
You can't handle Quizmania !

493
00:38:12,068 --> 00:38:14,662
Annalise started it,
she did, I heard her.

494
00:38:14,705 --> 00:38:17,981
Tish, don't make it worse.
Leo, what did she buy you ? Soap !

495
00:38:18,025 --> 00:38:22,183
A 75 pence soap ! I'm never
talking to your family again.

496
00:38:22,226 --> 00:38:25,023
Annalise, don't you dare !
I'm putting my foot down !

497
00:38:25,066 --> 00:38:26,982
Make a fool of yourself.

498
00:38:27,026 --> 00:38:30,460
God knows, you've been doing it
for the last 25 years, why stop now ?

499
00:38:30,507 --> 00:38:34,501
Oh, Mum, don't ! I asked the DJ
and he's playing that song later,

500
00:38:34,545 --> 00:38:36,141
he's playing Popcorn...

501
00:39:09,627 --> 00:39:11,663
I went to the moon today.

502
00:39:11,706 --> 00:39:14,261
Bit more peaceful than down here.

503
00:39:14,307 --> 00:39:18,343
You never even told me who you are.
The Doctor.

504
00:39:18,388 --> 00:39:22,223
But what sort of species ? It's not
every day I get to ask that.

505
00:39:22,268 --> 00:39:25,221
I'm a Time Lord. Right.

506
00:39:25,265 --> 00:39:27,943
Not pompous at all, then.

507
00:39:27,988 --> 00:39:30,301
I just thought,
since you saved my life,

508
00:39:30,347 --> 00:39:34,623
and I've got a brand new sonic
screwdriver which needs road-testing,

509
00:39:34,667 --> 00:39:36,820
you might fancy a trip.

510
00:39:36,868 --> 00:39:39,941
What, into space ? Well...

511
00:39:39,987 --> 00:39:41,261
I can't, I've got exams.

512
00:39:41,305 --> 00:39:45,503
I've got things to do,
I've got to go and pay the rent.
I've got my family going mad.

513
00:39:45,546 --> 00:39:47,823
If it helps,

514
00:39:47,866 --> 00:39:52,021
I can travel in time as well.
Get out of here. I can !

515
00:39:52,068 --> 00:39:54,381
Come on, that is going too far.
I'll prove it.

516
00:40:20,745 --> 00:40:23,743
Told you ! No, but,

517
00:40:23,786 --> 00:40:27,221
that was this morning, but...
Did you ?

518
00:40:27,268 --> 00:40:30,141
Oh, my God ! You can travel in time.

519
00:40:30,186 --> 00:40:34,301
But if you could see me
this morning, why didn't you tell me
not to go into work ?

520
00:40:34,346 --> 00:40:38,181
Crossing into established events
is strictly forbidden.

521
00:40:38,227 --> 00:40:39,740
Except for cheap tricks.

522
00:40:39,788 --> 00:40:41,780
And that's your spaceship ?

523
00:40:41,827 --> 00:40:43,900
It's called the TARDIS.

524
00:40:43,948 --> 00:40:47,181
Time And Relative Dimension In Space.

525
00:40:47,228 --> 00:40:49,542
Your spaceship's made of wood.

526
00:40:49,585 --> 00:40:53,103
But there's not much room,
we'd be a bit intimate.

527
00:40:54,545 --> 00:40:56,101
Take a look.

528
00:41:03,227 --> 00:41:05,860
No, no, no.

529
00:41:07,467 --> 00:41:09,942
But it's just a box.

530
00:41:09,987 --> 00:41:13,463
But it's huge ! How does it do that ?

531
00:41:13,506 --> 00:41:15,382
It's wood !

532
00:41:15,425 --> 00:41:19,060
It's like a box with that room
just crammed in !

533
00:41:21,147 --> 00:41:24,381
It's bigger on the inside !
Is it ? I hadn't noticed.

534
00:41:25,867 --> 00:41:28,103
Right then, let's get going.

535
00:41:28,146 --> 00:41:30,423
But is there a crew ?

536
00:41:30,468 --> 00:41:33,543
Like, a navigator and stuff,
where is everyone ?

537
00:41:33,585 --> 00:41:35,423
Just me.

538
00:41:35,468 --> 00:41:37,021
All on your own ?

539
00:41:37,067 --> 00:41:39,620
Well, sometimes I have guests.

540
00:41:39,667 --> 00:41:41,743
I mean, friends,
travelling with me.

541
00:41:41,788 --> 00:41:45,220
I had... There was recently
a friend of mine.

542
00:41:45,268 --> 00:41:47,142
Rose, her name was Rose.

543
00:41:48,708 --> 00:41:51,983
And we were together. Anyway.

544
00:41:52,027 --> 00:41:55,100
Where is she now ? With her family.
Happy ! She's fine.

545
00:41:55,147 --> 00:41:57,262
Not that you're replacing her !

546
00:41:57,305 --> 00:41:59,183
Never said I was. Just one trip.

547
00:41:59,227 --> 00:42:04,181
To say thanks, you get one trip, then
back home. I'd rather be on my own.

548
00:42:06,388 --> 00:42:09,143
Well, you're the one that kissed me.

549
00:42:09,185 --> 00:42:12,381
That was a genetic transfer !

550
00:42:15,265 --> 00:42:18,781
Now, don't. And then travel
all the way across the universe

551
00:42:18,825 --> 00:42:20,223
just to ask me on a date.

552
00:42:20,267 --> 00:42:22,460
Stop it !

553
00:42:22,508 --> 00:42:25,861
For the record,
I'm not remotely interested.

554
00:42:25,906 --> 00:42:28,783
I only go for humans.

555
00:42:28,825 --> 00:42:31,782
Good ! Now then,

556
00:42:31,826 --> 00:42:33,700
close down the gravitic anomalyser.

557
00:42:33,746 --> 00:42:35,942
Fire up the helmic regulator.

558
00:42:35,987 --> 00:42:38,060
And finally,

559
00:42:38,105 --> 00:42:40,461
the handbrake !

560
00:42:40,506 --> 00:42:42,462
Ready ?

561
00:42:42,507 --> 00:42:45,662
No ! Off we go !

562
00:42:48,427 --> 00:42:53,460
Blimey, it's a bit bumpy !
Welcome aboard, Miss Jones.

563
00:42:53,506 --> 00:42:55,461
It's my pleasure, Mr Smith.

564
00:43:05,788 --> 00:43:09,141
The Globe Theatre
containing the man himself.

565
00:43:09,188 --> 00:43:11,223
Shut your big fat mouths !

566
00:43:11,268 --> 00:43:12,860
Mr Shakespeare, isn't it ?

567
00:43:12,905 --> 00:43:16,742
No autographs. Loves Labours Won
will never be played.

568
00:43:16,786 --> 00:43:18,580
Upon this night the work is done.

569
00:43:18,628 --> 00:43:20,143
Witchcraft.

570
00:43:22,386 --> 00:43:25,700
Hey nonny nonny ! No !

571
00:43:25,748 --> 00:43:31,063
The entire future of the human race,
it ends right now in 1599
if we don't stop it.

572
00:43:31,105 --> 00:43:33,580
Ba-da-boom-ba ! That's quite good.

573
00:44:10,348 --> 00:44:14,903
