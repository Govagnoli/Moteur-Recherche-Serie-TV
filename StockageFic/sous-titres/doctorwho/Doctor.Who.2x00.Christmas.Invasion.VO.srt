Here we are, then. London, Earth,
the Solar System. I did it!

00:01:44,413 --> 00:01:46,214  X1:256 X2:463 Y1:488 Y2:523

00:01:46,258 --> 00:01:48,403  X1:168 X2:551 Y1:488 Y2:523

16
00:01:51,648 --> 00:01:56,362  X1:156 X2:563 Y1:416 Y2:523
There was something I had to
tell you, something important.
What was it? Hold on, hold on.

17
00:01:56,406 --> 00:01:57,840  X1:264 X2:455 Y1:488 Y2:523
Hold on. Shh.

18
00:01:57,888 --> 00:02:00,620  X1:276 X2:443 Y1:488 Y2:523
Oh! I know!

19
00:02:02,236 --> 00:02:04,402  X1:246 X2:471 Y1:488 Y2:523
Merry Christmas!

20
00:02:07,348 --> 00:02:12,343  X1:126 X2:593 Y1:416 Y2:523
What happened? Is he all right?
I dunno, he just keeled over.
But where's the Doctor? That's him.

21
00:02:12,386 --> 00:02:15,340  X1:224 X2:495 Y1:452 Y2:523
Right in front of you.
That's the Doctor.

22
00:02:15,385 --> 00:02:19,310  X1:188 X2:531 Y1:452 Y2:523
What d'you mean, "That's
the Doctor"? Doctor who?

23
00:02:59,856 --> 00:03:01,571  X1:278 X2:441 Y1:488 Y2:523
Here we go.

24
00:03:01,618 --> 00:03:07,081  X1:144 X2:575 Y1:416 Y2:523
Tina the Cleaner's got this lodger,
medical student, and she was
fast asleep, so I just took it.

25
00:03:07,127 --> 00:03:11,392  X1:142 X2:575 Y1:416 Y2:523
I still say we should take him
to a hospital. They'd lock him up.
They'd dissect him.

26
00:03:11,446 --> 00:03:15,492  X1:124 X2:595 Y1:416 Y2:523
One bottle of his blood could
change the future of the human race.
Now shush!

HEARTBEAT SOUNDS

29
00:03:33,777 --> 00:03:35,892  X1:188 X2:531 Y1:452 Y2:523
Both working.
What d'you mean, "both"?

30
00:03:35,938 --> 00:03:40,002  X1:172 X2:545 Y1:452 Y2:523
He's got two hearts.
Oh, don't be stupid. He has.

31
00:03:40,045 --> 00:03:43,163  X1:164 X2:553 Y1:452 Y2:523
Anything else he's got two of?
Leave him alone!

32
00:04:05,467 --> 00:04:08,943  X1:146 X2:573 Y1:488 Y2:523
How can he go changing his face?

33
00:04:08,987 --> 00:04:11,733  X1:184 X2:535 Y1:452 Y2:523
Is that a different face
or is he a different person?

34
00:04:11,777 --> 00:04:14,113  X1:228 X2:489 Y1:488 Y2:523
How should I know?

35
00:04:15,735 --> 00:04:17,401  X1:314 X2:403 Y1:488 Y2:523
Sorry.

36
00:04:17,447 --> 00:04:21,673  X1:180 X2:539 Y1:452 Y2:523
The thing is...
I thought I knew him, Mum.

37
00:04:23,355 --> 00:04:24,833  X1:170 X2:549 Y1:488 Y2:523
I thought me and him were...

38
00:04:27,156 --> 00:04:30,550  X1:180 X2:539 Y1:488 Y2:523
Then he goes and does this.

39
00:04:30,598 --> 00:04:33,871  X1:146 X2:573 Y1:488 Y2:523
I keep forgetting he's not human.

40
00:04:37,348 --> 00:04:42,701  X1:136 X2:583 Y1:452 Y2:523
The big question is, where did you
get a pair of men's pyjamas from?!

41
00:04:42,746 --> 00:04:47,731  X1:144 X2:573 Y1:416 Y2:523
Howard's been staying over.
What? Howard from the market?
How long's that been going on?

42
00:04:47,777 --> 00:04:51,931  X1:156 X2:563 Y1:416 Y2:523
A month or so. First,
he starts delivering to the door.
I thought, "That's odd."

43
00:04:51,978 --> 00:04:56,682  X1:132 X2:587 Y1:416 Y2:523
Next thing you know, there's a bag
of oranges... Is that Harriet Jones?
Never mind me!

44
00:04:56,727 --> 00:05:01,442  X1:172 X2:547 Y1:416 Y2:523
Why's she on telly?
She's Prime Minister now!
I'm 18 quid a week better off.

45
00:05:01,487 --> 00:05:06,033  X1:166 X2:553 Y1:416 Y2:523
They're calling it Britain's
golden age. I keep on saying,
"My Rose has met her."

46
00:05:06,075 --> 00:05:10,232  X1:138 X2:581 Y1:452 Y2:523
Did more than that.
Stopped World War Three with her.

47
00:05:10,275 --> 00:05:11,871  X1:268 X2:451 Y1:488 Y2:523
Harriet Jones.

48
00:05:11,917 --> 00:05:17,741  X1:132 X2:585 Y1:416 Y2:523
What about those calling the
Guinevere One Space Probe a waste
of money? I completely disagree.

49
00:05:17,787 --> 00:05:22,861  X1:158 X2:561 Y1:416 Y2:523
The Guinevere One Space Probe
represents this country's
limitless ambition.

50
00:05:22,905 --> 00:05:26,142  X1:178 X2:541 Y1:452 Y2:523
British workmanship, sailing
up there among the stars.

51
00:05:26,186 --> 00:05:32,640  X1:168 X2:551 Y1:416 Y2:523
This is the spirit of Christmas,
birth, and rejoicing,
and the dawn of a new age.

52
00:05:32,688 --> 00:05:35,521  X1:174 X2:543 Y1:452 Y2:523
That is what we're achieving,
50 million miles away.

53
00:05:35,565 --> 00:05:37,201  X1:218 X2:501 Y1:488 Y2:523
Our very own miracle!

54
00:05:37,247 --> 00:05:40,801  X1:130 X2:589 Y1:452 Y2:523
The unmanned probe Guinevere One
is about to make its final descent.

55
00:05:40,847 --> 00:05:45,262  X1:172 X2:545 Y1:416 Y2:523
Photographs of the Martian
landscape should be received
by midnight tonight.

56
00:06:01,976 --> 00:06:03,651  X1:186 X2:533 Y1:488 Y2:523
What d'you need, 20 quid?

57
00:06:03,697 --> 00:06:06,891  X1:164 X2:555 Y1:452 Y2:523
D'you mind? I'll pay you back.
Call it a Christmas present.

58
00:06:06,937 --> 00:06:09,881  X1:196 X2:523 Y1:488 Y2:523
God, I'm all out of synch.

59
00:06:09,927 --> 00:06:13,241  X1:158 X2:559 Y1:452 Y2:523
You just forget about Christmas
and things in the TARDIS.

60
00:06:13,287 --> 00:06:16,241  X1:186 X2:533 Y1:452 Y2:523
They don't exist.
You get sort of...timeless.

61
00:06:16,285 --> 00:06:19,710  X1:132 X2:585 Y1:452 Y2:523
That's fascinating(!) I love
hearing stories about the TARDIS(!)

62
00:06:19,758 --> 00:06:22,753  X1:182 X2:535 Y1:452 Y2:523
Go on, tell us another,
I could listen to it all day(!)

63
00:06:22,797 --> 00:06:25,153  X1:182 X2:537 Y1:452 Y2:523
TARDIS this, TARDIS that...
Shut up!

64
00:06:25,198 --> 00:06:29,342  X1:148 X2:571 Y1:416 Y2:523
Ooh, and one time,
the TARDIS landed in a big yellow
garden, full of balloons!

65
00:06:29,387 --> 00:06:31,581  X1:170 X2:549 Y1:488 Y2:523
I'm not like that! You so are!

66
00:06:31,625 --> 00:06:34,861  X1:160 X2:559 Y1:452 Y2:523
Must drive you mad. Surprised
you don't give up on me.

67
00:06:34,907 --> 00:06:39,813  X1:164 X2:555 Y1:416 Y2:523
That's the thing, isn't it?
You can rely on me. I don't go
changing my face. Yeah.

68
00:06:39,858 --> 00:06:43,293  X1:148 X2:571 Y1:488 Y2:523
What if he's dying? OK... Sorry!

69
00:06:43,338 --> 00:06:46,683  X1:208 X2:511 Y1:452 Y2:523
Just let it be Christmas.
Can you do that?

70
00:06:46,728 --> 00:06:50,760  X1:204 X2:515 Y1:452 Y2:523
Just for a bit?
You, me and Christmas.

71
00:06:50,808 --> 00:06:52,520  X1:286 X2:433 Y1:488 Y2:523
No Doctor,

72
00:06:52,568 --> 00:06:55,602  X1:136 X2:583 Y1:488 Y2:523
no bog-monsters, no life or death.

73
00:06:55,646 --> 00:06:57,000  X1:328 X2:389 Y1:488 Y2:523
OK.

74
00:06:57,048 --> 00:06:59,193  X1:258 X2:461 Y1:488 Y2:523
Promise? Yes!

75
00:06:59,238 --> 00:07:02,180  X1:194 X2:523 Y1:452 Y2:523
Right. What are you
gonna get for your mum?

76
00:07:03,197 --> 00:07:06,381  X1:148 X2:571 Y1:452 Y2:523
I'm round there all the time now.
She does my dinner on a Sunday.

77
00:07:06,428 --> 00:07:10,242  X1:144 X2:575 Y1:452 Y2:523
She talks about you all afternoon.
Yap, yap, yap, yap...

78
00:07:11,146 --> 00:07:12,700  X1:230 X2:487 Y1:488 Y2:523
A nice pen in a box.

00:07:57,898 --> 00:08:01,213  X1:110 X2:609 Y1:452 Y2:523

82

Taxi!

83
00:08:03,365 --> 00:08:05,002  X1:202 X2:517 Y1:488 Y2:523
They're after the Doctor.

84
00:08:05,047 --> 00:08:09,882  X1:144 X2:575 Y1:416 Y2:523
I can't even go shopping with you!
We get attacked by a brass band!
Who are you phoning? My mum.

85
00:08:09,928 --> 00:08:13,551  X1:192 X2:527 Y1:452 Y2:523
She  turns up, no warning,
I've got nothing in.

86
00:08:13,596 --> 00:08:17,831  X1:158 X2:561 Y1:416 Y2:523
I said, "Rose, if you want
a Christmas dinner
of meat paste, then so be it..."

87
00:08:17,875 --> 00:08:19,871  X1:240 X2:479 Y1:488 Y2:523
Get off the phone!

88
00:08:19,917 --> 00:08:22,023  X1:166 X2:553 Y1:488 Y2:523
Who were those Santa things?

89
00:08:22,068 --> 00:08:26,063  X1:182 X2:537 Y1:416 Y2:523
I dunno, but think about it.
They were after us.
What's important about us?

90
00:08:26,106 --> 00:08:28,742  X1:190 X2:527 Y1:452 Y2:523
Nothing, except we've got
the Doctor!

91
00:08:28,786 --> 00:08:30,453  X1:212 X2:507 Y1:488 Y2:523
No, don't come round.

92
00:08:30,496 --> 00:08:32,772  X1:196 X2:523 Y1:488 Y2:523
The flat's all topsy-turvy.

93
00:08:32,818 --> 00:08:35,450  X1:224 X2:495 Y1:452 Y2:523
She just barges in
and litters the place.

94
00:08:35,497 --> 00:08:37,863  X1:182 X2:537 Y1:452 Y2:523
Yeah, I'll come and see you
Boxing Day.

95
00:08:47,368 --> 00:08:49,593  X1:200 X2:517 Y1:488 Y2:523
So save us a chipolata...

96
00:08:49,638 --> 00:08:53,193  X1:150 X2:567 Y1:452 Y2:523
Get off the phone! It's only Bev.
She says hello.

97
00:08:53,238 --> 00:08:56,352  X1:170 X2:549 Y1:488 Y2:523
Bev? Look, it'll have to wait.

98
00:08:56,398 --> 00:08:59,270  X1:140 X2:579 Y1:452 Y2:523
It's not safe. We've gotta get out.
Where can we go?

99
00:08:59,318 --> 00:09:02,982  X1:174 X2:545 Y1:416 Y2:523
My mate Stan will put us up.
That's only two streets away.
Where's Mo now?

100
00:09:03,028 --> 00:09:06,180  X1:166 X2:553 Y1:452 Y2:523
I dunno, the Peak District.
We'll go to Cousin Mo's, then.

101
00:09:06,226 --> 00:09:08,690  X1:190 X2:529 Y1:452 Y2:523
It's Christmas Eve,
we're not going anywhere!

102
00:09:08,738 --> 00:09:11,402  X1:124 X2:595 Y1:488 Y2:523
What are you babbling about? Mum.

103
00:09:11,895 --> 00:09:15,803  X1:174 X2:545 Y1:452 Y2:523
Where did you get that tree?
That's a new tree.

104
00:09:15,847 --> 00:09:18,083  X1:220 X2:499 Y1:452 Y2:523
Where did you get it?
I thought it was you.

105
00:09:18,127 --> 00:09:20,042  X1:108 X2:611 Y1:488 Y2:523
How can it be me? You went shopping.

106
00:09:20,085 --> 00:09:24,512  X1:142 X2:577 Y1:452 Y2:523
There was a ring at the door,
and there it was.  That wasn't me.

107
00:09:24,558 --> 00:09:26,890  X1:246 X2:473 Y1:488 Y2:523
Then  who was it?

108
00:09:30,836 --> 00:09:32,952  X1:236 X2:483 Y1:488 Y2:523
You're kidding me.

00:09:37,747 --> 00:09:40,691  X1:078 X2:295 Y1:488 Y2:523
JACKIE SCREAMS

111
00:09:45,027 --> 00:09:46,783  X1:246 X2:471 Y1:488 Y2:523
Go, go! Get out!

112
00:09:49,217 --> 00:09:52,891  X1:132 X2:587 Y1:452 Y2:523
We've gotta save the Doctor. What
are you doing? We can't leave him.

113
00:09:52,938 --> 00:09:54,902  X1:304 X2:415 Y1:488 Y2:523
Mickey!

114
00:09:55,886 --> 00:09:59,083  X1:186 X2:533 Y1:452 Y2:523
Leave it. Get out, get out!
Mickey!

115
00:09:59,728 --> 00:10:01,532  X1:248 X2:469 Y1:488 Y2:523
Get out of there!

116
00:10:02,328 --> 00:10:05,432  X1:164 X2:555 Y1:452 Y2:523
No, leave him, just leave him.
Get in here!

117
00:10:09,078 --> 00:10:10,632  X1:246 X2:471 Y1:488 Y2:523
Doctor, wake up!

118
00:10:30,925 --> 00:10:34,450  X1:228 X2:491 Y1:452 Y2:523
I'm gonna get killed
by a Christmas tree!

119
00:10:37,248 --> 00:10:38,760  X1:294 X2:423 Y1:488 Y2:523
Help me.

120
00:10:49,397 --> 00:10:52,062  X1:252 X2:467 Y1:488 Y2:523
Remote control.

121
00:10:52,107 --> 00:10:54,081  X1:202 X2:517 Y1:488 Y2:523
But who's controlling it?

122
00:10:59,547 --> 00:11:02,571  X1:172 X2:547 Y1:488 Y2:523
That's them. What are they?

123
00:11:18,045 --> 00:11:20,671  X1:240 X2:479 Y1:488 Y2:523
They've just gone!

124
00:11:20,715 --> 00:11:23,391  X1:154 X2:565 Y1:488 Y2:523
What kind of rubbish were they?

125
00:11:23,438 --> 00:11:26,750  X1:164 X2:555 Y1:452 Y2:523
They're  not much cop if a sonic
screwdriver scares them off.

126
00:11:26,797 --> 00:11:29,463  X1:244 X2:475 Y1:488 Y2:523
Pilot fish. What?

127
00:11:29,507 --> 00:11:31,661  X1:200 X2:519 Y1:488 Y2:523
They were just pilot fish.

128
00:11:31,708 --> 00:11:34,022  X1:078 X2:415 Y1:452 Y2:523
HE COUGHS
Aaargh!

129
00:11:34,066 --> 00:11:36,700  X1:260 X2:457 Y1:488 Y2:523
What's wrong?

130
00:11:36,745 --> 00:11:39,332  X1:188 X2:531 Y1:488 Y2:523
You woke me up too soon.

131
00:11:39,378 --> 00:11:42,560  X1:198 X2:521 Y1:452 Y2:523
I'm still regenerating.
I'm bursting with energy.

132
00:11:44,488 --> 00:11:48,561  X1:164 X2:553 Y1:452 Y2:523
You see? The pilot fish could
smell it, a million miles away,

133
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:51,841  X1:158 X2:561 Y1:452 Y2:523
so they eliminate the defence -
you lot - then carry me off.

134
00:11:51,888 --> 00:11:55,321  X1:166 X2:551 Y1:452 Y2:523
They could run their batteries
off me for a couple of years...

135
00:11:57,837 --> 00:12:00,471  X1:178 X2:541 Y1:452 Y2:523
My head! I'm having a
neuron implosion. I need...

136
00:12:00,515 --> 00:12:04,273  X1:120 X2:599 Y1:452 Y2:523
What d'you need? Tell me. I need...
Painkillers? D'you need aspirin?

137
00:12:04,316 --> 00:12:07,020  X1:140 X2:579 Y1:452 Y2:523
I need... Codeine? Paracetamol?
Pepto-Bismol?

138
00:12:07,066 --> 00:12:10,142  X1:182 X2:537 Y1:452 Y2:523
Liquid paraffin? Vitamin C?
Vitamin D? Vitamin E?

139
00:12:10,188 --> 00:12:13,940  X1:120 X2:597 Y1:452 Y2:523
Is it food? Something simple?
A bowl of soup? A nice bowl of soup.

140
00:12:13,985 --> 00:12:17,772  X1:154 X2:565 Y1:416 Y2:523
Soup and a sandwich?
Soup and a little ham sandwich?
I need you to shut up.

141
00:12:17,817 --> 00:12:20,600  X1:116 X2:603 Y1:488 Y2:523
He hasn't changed that much, has he?

142
00:12:24,096 --> 00:12:26,042  X1:186 X2:533 Y1:488 Y2:523
We haven't got much time.

143
00:12:26,087 --> 00:12:28,003  X1:186 X2:533 Y1:488 Y2:523
If there's pilot fish, then...

144
00:12:28,042 --> 00:12:31,645  X1:130 X2:587 Y1:452 Y2:523
Why's there an apple in my dressing
gown? That's Howard, sorry.

145
00:12:31,689 --> 00:12:34,913  X1:114 X2:605 Y1:452 Y2:523
He keeps apples in his dressing gown?
He gets hungry.

146
00:12:34,953 --> 00:12:37,314  X1:176 X2:541 Y1:452 Y2:523
He gets hungry in his sleep?
Sometimes.

147
00:12:37,358 --> 00:12:40,150  X1:228 X2:489 Y1:488 Y2:523
Graaaargh! Aaargh!

148
00:12:40,196 --> 00:12:43,540  X1:244 X2:475 Y1:488 Y2:523
Brain, collapsing!

149
00:12:43,587 --> 00:12:45,071  X1:232 X2:485 Y1:488 Y2:523
But the pilot fish...

150
00:12:45,828 --> 00:12:48,903  X1:120 X2:597 Y1:488 Y2:523
The pilot fish mean that something...

151
00:12:50,388 --> 00:12:52,062  X1:270 X2:449 Y1:488 Y2:523
Something...

152
00:12:55,578 --> 00:12:57,702  X1:222 X2:495 Y1:488 Y2:523
Something's coming.

153
00:13:17,875 --> 00:13:21,840  X1:154 X2:565 Y1:452 Y2:523
Jackie, I'm using the phone line.
Is that OK? Keep account of it.

154
00:13:23,505 --> 00:13:25,901  X1:270 X2:449 Y1:488 Y2:523
It's midnight.

155
00:13:25,947 --> 00:13:28,860  X1:174 X2:545 Y1:488 Y2:523
Christmas Day. Any change?

156
00:13:28,905 --> 00:13:31,773  X1:132 X2:587 Y1:488 Y2:523
He's worse. Just one heart beating.

157
00:13:31,818 --> 00:13:34,651  X1:184 X2:535 Y1:452 Y2:523
TV: Scientists in charge
of Britain's mission to Mars

158
00:13:34,698 --> 00:13:38,443  X1:124 X2:595 Y1:452 Y2:523
have re-established contact
with the Guinevere One Space Probe.

159
00:13:38,486 --> 00:13:42,720  X1:174 X2:545 Y1:416 Y2:523
They're expecting the first
transmission from the planet
in the next few minutes.

160
00:13:42,766 --> 00:13:44,242  X1:202 X2:515 Y1:488 Y2:523
We're back on schedule.

161
00:13:44,285 --> 00:13:46,961  X1:210 X2:509 Y1:452 Y2:523
We've received a signal
from Guinevere One.

162
00:13:47,005 --> 00:13:50,551  X1:170 X2:549 Y1:452 Y2:523
The Mars landing would seem
to be an unqualified success.

163
00:13:50,597 --> 00:13:53,793  X1:180 X2:537 Y1:452 Y2:523
Is it true you completely
lost contact earlier tonight?

164
00:13:53,836 --> 00:13:55,950  X1:178 X2:541 Y1:488 Y2:523
Yes, we had a bit of a scare.

165
00:13:55,997 --> 00:14:02,182  X1:132 X2:587 Y1:416 Y2:523
Guinevere seemed to fall off the
scope, but it was just a blip,
only disappeared for a few seconds.

166
00:14:02,228 --> 00:14:04,262  X1:158 X2:561 Y1:488 Y2:523
She's fine now, absolutely fine.

167
00:14:04,308 --> 00:14:08,412  X1:142 X2:575 Y1:452 Y2:523
We're getting the first pictures,
transmitted live, any minute now.

168
00:14:08,457 --> 00:14:11,053  X1:154 X2:563 Y1:488 Y2:523
I'd better get back to it, thanks.

169
00:14:11,096 --> 00:14:14,360  X1:214 X2:505 Y1:488 Y2:523
Here we go, pilot fish.

170
00:14:14,408 --> 00:14:17,800  X1:150 X2:567 Y1:452 Y2:523
They're scavengers, like he said.
Harmless, they're just tiny.

171
00:14:17,845 --> 00:14:20,721  X1:180 X2:539 Y1:452 Y2:523
But the little fish
swim alongside the big fish.

172
00:14:20,768 --> 00:14:22,881  X1:202 X2:517 Y1:452 Y2:523
D'you mean like sharks?
Big sharks.

173
00:14:22,927 --> 00:14:26,832  X1:136 X2:583 Y1:452 Y2:523
The Doctor means we've had them,
now we get that.

174
00:14:26,876 --> 00:14:28,561  X1:218 X2:499 Y1:488 Y2:523
Something is coming.

175
00:14:30,956 --> 00:14:32,473  X1:282 X2:437 Y1:488 Y2:523
How close?

176
00:14:32,518 --> 00:14:36,581  X1:162 X2:557 Y1:416 Y2:523
I don't know, but the pilot fish
don't swim far from the daddy.
So it's close?

177
00:14:36,626 --> 00:14:39,262  X1:230 X2:489 Y1:488 Y2:523
Funny sort of rocks.

178
00:14:39,306 --> 00:14:41,192  X1:250 X2:469 Y1:488 Y2:523
That's not rocks.

179
00:14:43,706 --> 00:14:47,752  X1:154 X2:565 Y1:452 Y2:523
TV: Coming live from the depths
of space on Christmas morn.

180
00:14:48,416 --> 00:14:50,750  X1:078 X2:207 Y1:488 Y2:523
IT ROARS

181
00:14:52,537 --> 00:14:55,840  X1:126 X2:593 Y1:344 Y2:415
The face of an alien life was
transmitted live tonight on BBC One.

182
00:14:55,887 --> 00:15:02,361  X1:122 X2:595 Y1:416 Y2:523
On the 25th of December, the
human race has been shown absolute
proof that alien life exists.

183
00:15:02,408 --> 00:15:05,712  X1:128 X2:591 Y1:452 Y2:523
These remarkable images have been
relayed across the world.

184
00:15:27,896 --> 00:15:29,400  X1:270 X2:449 Y1:488 Y2:523
This way, sir.

185
00:15:49,678 --> 00:15:51,190  X1:268 X2:449 Y1:488 Y2:523
Mr Llewellyn.

186
00:15:56,268 --> 00:15:59,462  X1:168 X2:551 Y1:452 Y2:523
Mr Llewellyn, ma'am.
Harriet Jones, Prime Minister.

187
00:15:59,506 --> 00:16:03,212  X1:132 X2:587 Y1:452 Y2:523
Yes, I know who you are.
Suppose I've ruined your Christmas.

188
00:16:03,258 --> 00:16:07,412  X1:144 X2:573 Y1:416 Y2:523
Never off duty.
Now, we've put out a cover story,
Alex has been handling it.

189
00:16:07,457 --> 00:16:11,080  X1:144 X2:575 Y1:452 Y2:523
We've said it was a hoax,
some sort of mask or prosthetics,

190
00:16:11,125 --> 00:16:13,881  X1:172 X2:547 Y1:452 Y2:523
students hijacking the signal,
that sort of thing.

191
00:16:13,928 --> 00:16:19,230  X1:132 X2:718 Y1:416 Y2:523
Alex is my right-hand man. I'm not
used to having a right-hand man.
I quite like it, though.   So do I.

192
00:16:19,275 --> 00:16:23,991  X1:136 X2:583 Y1:416 Y2:523
I don't suppose there is any chance
it was a hoax? That would be nice.
Then we could all go home.

193
00:16:24,036 --> 00:16:28,862  X1:162 X2:557 Y1:416 Y2:523
I don't suppose anyone's
offered you a coffee? Um, no.
The transmission was genuine.

194
00:16:28,918 --> 00:16:33,940  X1:138 X2:581 Y1:416 Y2:523
And this seems to be a new
species of alien. At least,
not one we've encountered before.

195
00:16:33,985 --> 00:16:37,292  X1:132 X2:587 Y1:452 Y2:523
You seem to be talking about aliens
as a matter of fact.

196
00:16:37,336 --> 00:16:42,572  X1:164 X2:553 Y1:416 Y2:523
There's an Act of Parliament
banning my autobiography.
Prime Minister? I'm with you.

197
00:16:45,087 --> 00:16:47,243  X1:204 X2:515 Y1:488 Y2:523
Miss Jacobs can explain.

198
00:16:47,287 --> 00:16:51,761  X1:168 X2:551 Y1:416 Y2:523
We haven't been introduced.
Harriet Jones, Prime Minister.
Yes, I know who you are.

199
00:16:51,805 --> 00:16:55,481  X1:172 X2:547 Y1:452 Y2:523
The transmission didn't come
from the surface of Mars.

200
00:16:55,527 --> 00:16:59,873  X1:116 X2:601 Y1:452 Y2:523
Guinevere One was broadcasting from
a point 5,000 miles above the planet.

201
00:16:59,916 --> 00:17:03,111  X1:140 X2:579 Y1:452 Y2:523
In other words, they've got a ship,
and the probe is on board.

202
00:17:03,155 --> 00:17:08,262  X1:138 X2:581 Y1:416 Y2:523
But if they're not from the surface,
they might not be from Mars.
Maybe they're not actual Martians.

203
00:17:08,305 --> 00:17:11,220  X1:136 X2:583 Y1:452 Y2:523
Of course not.
Martians look completely different.

204
00:17:11,268 --> 00:17:15,853  X1:132 X2:587 Y1:416 Y2:523
We think the ship was in flight when
they just came across the probe.
And they're moving.

205
00:17:15,897 --> 00:17:18,972  X1:178 X2:539 Y1:452 Y2:523
The ship's still in flight now.
It's on the Hubble Array.

206
00:17:19,018 --> 00:17:22,651  X1:188 X2:529 Y1:452 Y2:523
Moving in which direction?
Towards us. How fast?

207
00:17:22,695 --> 00:17:25,123  X1:112 X2:607 Y1:488 Y2:523
Very fast. What was your name again?

208
00:17:25,165 --> 00:17:26,733  X1:318 X2:401 Y1:488 Y2:523
Sally.

209
00:17:27,726 --> 00:17:29,232  X1:246 X2:473 Y1:488 Y2:523
Thank you, Sally.

210
00:17:33,598 --> 00:17:37,830  X1:180 X2:539 Y1:452 Y2:523
Rose! Take a look. I've got
access to the military.

211
00:17:37,875 --> 00:17:41,301  X1:144 X2:575 Y1:452 Y2:523
They're tracking a spaceship.
It's big, fast and coming this way.

212
00:17:41,347 --> 00:17:43,871  X1:156 X2:563 Y1:488 Y2:523
Coming for what? The Doctor?!

213
00:17:43,917 --> 00:17:48,223  X1:162 X2:557 Y1:452 Y2:523
I don't know.
Maybe it's coming for all of us.

214
00:17:48,268 --> 00:17:50,941  X1:246 X2:471 Y1:452 Y2:523
Gatz tak ka thaa!
Ka zu me fedrok,

215
00:17:50,985 --> 00:17:53,892  X1:240 X2:477 Y1:488 Y2:523
ka zu me Sycorax!

216
00:17:53,935 --> 00:17:56,252  X1:174 X2:543 Y1:488 Y2:523
Have you seen them before?

217
00:17:56,297 --> 00:17:57,811  X1:330 X2:389 Y1:488 Y2:523
No.

218

226
00:18:14,876 --> 00:18:16,351  X1:300 X2:419 Y1:488 Y2:523
Yes, sir.

227
00:18:17,598 --> 00:18:19,951  X1:286 X2:433 Y1:488 Y2:523
Di-ga gah!

228
00:18:19,997 --> 00:18:22,300  X1:228 X2:491 Y1:452 Y2:523
I don't understand
what they're saying.

229
00:18:22,346 --> 00:18:27,981  X1:148 X2:571 Y1:416 Y2:523
The TARDIS translates
alien languages, inside my head,
all the time, wherever I am.

230
00:18:28,026 --> 00:18:29,981  X1:180 X2:539 Y1:488 Y2:523
So why isn't it doing it now?

231
00:18:31,497 --> 00:18:33,621  X1:170 X2:549 Y1:488 Y2:523
I dunno. Must be the Doctor.

232
00:18:35,098 --> 00:18:37,591  X1:184 X2:535 Y1:452 Y2:523
Like he's part of the circuit,
and he's...

233
00:18:39,136 --> 00:18:41,303  X1:264 X2:455 Y1:488 Y2:523
.he's broken.

234
00:18:59,357 --> 00:19:01,860  X1:190 X2:527 Y1:452 Y2:523
I'm getting demands
from Washington, ma'am.

235
00:19:01,918 --> 00:19:06,200  X1:150 X2:567 Y1:452 Y2:523
The President is insisting that
he takes control of the situation.

236
00:19:07,458 --> 00:19:11,851  X1:140 X2:579 Y1:452 Y2:523
You can tell the President,
and please use these exact words,

237
00:19:11,898 --> 00:19:15,500  X1:132 X2:587 Y1:452 Y2:523
he's not my boss, and he's certainly
not turning this into a war.

238
00:19:17,806 --> 00:19:22,322  X1:150 X2:569 Y1:416 Y2:523
What have we got? Nothing yet.
Translating an alien
language is going to take time.

239
00:19:22,365 --> 00:19:24,393  X1:208 X2:509 Y1:488 Y2:523
How far off is the ship?

240
00:19:24,437 --> 00:19:26,831  X1:246 X2:473 Y1:488 Y2:523
About five hours.

241
00:19:26,875 --> 00:19:34,273  X1:156 X2:563 Y1:416 Y2:523
Despite claims of an alien hoax,
it's been reported that NATO
forces are on red alert.

242
00:19:34,316 --> 00:19:36,502  X1:216 X2:503 Y1:488 Y2:523
Come on, sweetheart.

243
00:19:36,548 --> 00:19:38,582  X1:234 X2:485 Y1:488 Y2:523
What do you need?

244
00:19:38,625 --> 00:19:41,142  X1:166 X2:553 Y1:488 Y2:523
What is it you need? Tell me.

245
00:19:41,185 --> 00:19:47,113  X1:158 X2:561 Y1:416 Y2:523
Speaking strictly off the record,
government sources are
calling this our longest night.

246
00:19:52,456 --> 00:19:55,600  X1:206 X2:513 Y1:452 Y2:523
I don't suppose
we've had a Code Nine?

247
00:19:55,648 --> 00:19:58,022  X1:128 X2:589 Y1:488 Y2:523
No sign of the Doctor? Nothing yet.

248
00:19:59,608 --> 00:20:02,481  X1:166 X2:551 Y1:488 Y2:523
You've met him, haven't you?

249
00:20:02,528 --> 00:20:05,101  X1:172 X2:547 Y1:452 Y2:523
More like the stuff of legend.
He is that.

250
00:20:06,077 --> 00:20:08,231  X1:268 X2:451 Y1:488 Y2:523
Failing him...

251
00:20:08,277 --> 00:20:10,113  X1:204 X2:515 Y1:488 Y2:523
What about Torchwood?

252
00:20:10,155 --> 00:20:13,980  X1:138 X2:581 Y1:416 Y2:523
I'm not supposed to know about it,
I realise that.
Not even the UN knows.

253
00:20:14,025 --> 00:20:20,302  X1:158 X2:561 Y1:416 Y2:523
But if ever there was a need
for Torchwood, it's now. I can't
take responsibility. I can.

254
00:20:20,347 --> 00:20:22,721  X1:186 X2:531 Y1:488 Y2:523
See to it. Get them ready.

255
00:20:27,217 --> 00:20:31,593  X1:152 X2:565 Y1:452 Y2:523
Prime Minister? Has it worked?
Just about.

256
00:20:34,967 --> 00:20:37,561  X1:164 X2:555 Y1:488 Y2:523
"People," that could be cattle,

257
00:20:37,606 --> 00:20:39,951  X1:136 X2:583 Y1:488 Y2:523
"you belong to us, to the Sycorax."

258
00:20:39,996 --> 00:20:42,351  X1:154 X2:565 Y1:452 Y2:523
They seem to be called Sycorax,
not Martians.

259
00:20:42,397 --> 00:20:46,511  X1:160 X2:559 Y1:416 Y2:523
"We own you. We now possess
your land, your minerals,
your precious stones.

260
00:20:46,555 --> 00:20:53,703  X1:152 X2:567 Y1:416 Y2:523
"You will surrender
or they will die. Sycorax strong,
Sycorax mighty. Sycorax rock,"

261
00:20:53,746 --> 00:20:56,500  X1:124 X2:595 Y1:488 Y2:523
as in the modern sense, "They rock!"

262
00:20:56,547 --> 00:20:58,211  X1:256 X2:463 Y1:488 Y2:523
"THEY will die."

263
00:20:58,256 --> 00:21:00,850  X1:134 X2:585 Y1:452 Y2:523
Not "YOU will die," "THEY will die."
Who's they?

264
00:21:00,897 --> 00:21:04,492  X1:164 X2:555 Y1:452 Y2:523
I don't know, but it is the right
personal pronoun. It's "they".

265
00:21:04,536 --> 00:21:07,362  X1:234 X2:483 Y1:488 Y2:523
Send them a reply.

266
00:21:07,405 --> 00:21:11,203  X1:162 X2:557 Y1:452 Y2:523
Tell  them this is a day of peace
on Planet Earth.

267
00:21:11,248 --> 00:21:15,130  X1:158 X2:561 Y1:452 Y2:523
Tell them we extend that peace
to the Sycorax.

268
00:21:16,965 --> 00:21:19,513  X1:236 X2:483 Y1:488 Y2:523
And then tell them

269
00:21:19,557 --> 00:21:22,553  X1:198 X2:521 Y1:452 Y2:523
this planet is armed,
and we do not surrender.

270
00:21:44,527 --> 00:21:46,881  X1:178 X2:539 Y1:488 Y2:523
The Doctor wouldn't do this,

271
00:21:46,928 --> 00:21:49,561  X1:142 X2:577 Y1:488 Y2:523
the old Doctor, the proper Doctor.

272
00:21:49,606 --> 00:21:52,000  X1:174 X2:545 Y1:488 Y2:523
He'd wake up. He'd save us.

273
00:21:52,046 --> 00:21:54,332  X1:158 X2:559 Y1:488 Y2:523
You really love him, don't you?

274
00:22:10,188 --> 00:22:11,740  X1:212 X2:507 Y1:488 Y2:523
They got the message.

275
00:22:11,785 --> 00:22:13,790  X1:190 X2:529 Y1:488 Y2:523
Here comes the response.

276
00:22:16,738 --> 00:22:19,230  X1:078 X2:193 Y1:488 Y2:523
HISSING

277
00:22:23,846 --> 00:22:25,960  X1:256 X2:463 Y1:488 Y2:523
What was that?

278
00:22:26,006 --> 00:22:27,562  X1:244 X2:475 Y1:488 Y2:523
Was that a reply?

279
00:22:27,607 --> 00:22:31,483  X1:160 X2:559 Y1:452 Y2:523
I don't know. Looked like
some sort of energy, or static?

280
00:22:31,526 --> 00:22:34,351  X1:126 X2:593 Y1:488 Y2:523
Almost like someone casting a spell.

281
00:22:34,398 --> 00:22:39,632  X1:174 X2:545 Y1:416 Y2:523
Maybe it's a different form
of language, some sort of
ideogram or pictogram, or...

282
00:22:39,676 --> 00:22:41,580  X1:260 X2:457 Y1:488 Y2:523
What the hell?

283
00:22:41,628 --> 00:22:44,460  X1:146 X2:571 Y1:488 Y2:523
It's the light. It's the same light.

284
00:22:44,505 --> 00:22:46,743  X1:134 X2:585 Y1:488 Y2:523
Sally? What are you doing? Sally?

285
00:22:46,788 --> 00:22:51,212  X1:112 X2:607 Y1:452 Y2:523
Leave her, you'll hurt her.
Let them pass! Where are they going?

286
00:22:51,256 --> 00:22:53,572  X1:202 X2:517 Y1:488 Y2:523
What is wrong with you?

287
00:22:53,618 --> 00:22:55,252  X1:310 X2:409 Y1:488 Y2:523
Jason?

288
00:22:55,298 --> 00:22:57,850  X1:250 X2:469 Y1:488 Y2:523
Jason?! Sandra!

289
00:22:57,896 --> 00:23:00,042  X1:138 X2:581 Y1:488 Y2:523
He won't listen. He's just walking.

290
00:23:00,086 --> 00:23:01,761  X1:212 X2:507 Y1:488 Y2:523
He won't stop walking.

291
00:23:01,808 --> 00:23:04,161  X1:180 X2:539 Y1:488 Y2:523
There's a sort of light thing.

292
00:23:04,206 --> 00:23:05,761  X1:314 X2:405 Y1:488 Y2:523
Jason!

293
00:23:05,807 --> 00:23:08,320  X1:232 X2:487 Y1:488 Y2:523
Stop  it! Right now.

294
00:23:08,367 --> 00:23:09,841  X1:264 X2:455 Y1:488 Y2:523
Please, Jason.

295
00:23:15,597 --> 00:23:18,592  X1:218 X2:501 Y1:452 Y2:523
They're all heading
in the same direction.

296
00:23:18,637 --> 00:23:22,061  X1:182 X2:537 Y1:452 Y2:523
But it's only certain people.
Why isn't it affecting us?

297
00:23:22,106 --> 00:23:24,182  X1:138 X2:581 Y1:488 Y2:523
It's happening all over the country.

298
00:23:24,226 --> 00:23:28,290  X1:130 X2:587 Y1:452 Y2:523
Alan, stop this! It's not funny any
more. Come back inside the house!

299
00:23:28,338 --> 00:23:33,493  X1:130 X2:587 Y1:452 Y2:523
Catrin, listen to Mummy, come
back inside now. And you Jonathan!

300
00:23:33,538 --> 00:23:35,360  X1:182 X2:535 Y1:488 Y2:523
Come back in with Mummy.

301
00:23:35,407 --> 00:23:41,061  X1:120 X2:597 Y1:416 Y2:523
Jonathan, come back in with Mummy.
You're scaring me now, come on!
Alan, help me out here, please!

302
00:23:42,845 --> 00:23:47,163  X1:184 X2:535 Y1:416 Y2:523
As far as I can tell,
they're heading for any sort
of high-rise building.

303
00:23:47,208 --> 00:23:49,940  X1:226 X2:493 Y1:452 Y2:523
Anything with stairs,
anything with steps.

304
00:24:04,458 --> 00:24:08,132  X1:176 X2:543 Y1:452 Y2:523
They're going all the way up.
They're going to the roof.

305
00:24:08,177 --> 00:24:12,011  X1:190 X2:529 Y1:416 Y2:523
Just making my way to
the front of the building.
There's hundreds of them.

306
00:24:12,056 --> 00:24:16,842  X1:124 X2:595 Y1:452 Y2:523
Oh, my God, they're going right up
to the edge. They're all gonna jump!

307
00:24:16,888 --> 00:24:18,730  X1:268 X2:451 Y1:488 Y2:523
Sally, stop it!

308
00:24:20,888 --> 00:24:23,641  X1:224 X2:493 Y1:452 Y2:523
It's Danny Llewellyn,
Daniel Llewellyn.

309
00:24:23,686 --> 00:24:26,643  X1:204 X2:515 Y1:452 Y2:523
Sally, just concentrate.
You're being controlled.

310
00:24:26,685 --> 00:24:28,712  X1:268 X2:451 Y1:488 Y2:523
We need you.

311
00:24:28,758 --> 00:24:30,473  X1:268 X2:451 Y1:488 Y2:523
Stop it, Sally!

312
00:24:35,678 --> 00:24:38,022  X1:196 X2:521 Y1:488 Y2:523
Jason, I'm talking to you.

313
00:24:38,066 --> 00:24:39,542  X1:292 X2:425 Y1:488 Y2:523
Just stop!

314
00:24:55,287 --> 00:24:57,720  X1:164 X2:555 Y1:488 Y2:523
It's not just the whole country.

315
00:24:57,766 --> 00:24:59,811  X1:226 X2:493 Y1:488 Y2:523
It's the whole world.

316
00:25:07,755 --> 00:25:10,912  X1:228 X2:491 Y1:452 Y2:523
They've stopped.
They've all stopped.

317
00:25:10,956 --> 00:25:14,781  X1:182 X2:535 Y1:452 Y2:523
They're just standing there.
Right on the edge.

318
00:25:14,825 --> 00:25:17,981  X1:222 X2:497 Y1:452 Y2:523
According to reports,
it's like a third.

319
00:25:18,025 --> 00:25:22,121  X1:132 X2:585 Y1:452 Y2:523
One third of the world's population,
two billion people, ready to jump.

320
00:25:24,055 --> 00:25:27,613  X1:192 X2:527 Y1:488 Y2:523
Surrender or they will die.

321
00:25:27,655 --> 00:25:30,000  X1:252 X2:465 Y1:488 Y2:523
What do we do?

322
00:25:30,047 --> 00:25:32,043  X1:298 X2:421 Y1:488 Y2:523
Nothing.

323
00:25:32,088 --> 00:25:35,533  X1:186 X2:531 Y1:452 Y2:523
There's no-one to save us.
Not any more.

324
00:25:37,445 --> 00:25:39,712  X1:140 X2:579 Y1:488 Y2:523
Wait a minute. There is a pattern.

325
00:25:39,756 --> 00:25:45,233  X1:118 X2:599 Y1:416 Y2:523
All these people tend to be
father and son, mother and daughter,
brothers and sisters.

326
00:25:45,276 --> 00:25:49,190  X1:138 X2:579 Y1:452 Y2:523
Family groups, but not
husbands and wives. Oh, my God.

327
00:25:49,235 --> 00:25:51,782  X1:234 X2:485 Y1:488 Y2:523
It's Guinevere One.

328
00:25:51,827 --> 00:25:54,343  X1:172 X2:547 Y1:452 Y2:523
Have you got medical records
for all your staff?

329
00:25:54,388 --> 00:25:55,892  X1:204 X2:515 Y1:488 Y2:523
Of course we have, yes.

330
00:25:58,815 --> 00:26:01,331  X1:204 X2:515 Y1:488 Y2:523
What about Torchwood?

331
00:26:01,378 --> 00:26:03,531  X1:240 X2:479 Y1:488 Y2:523
Still working on it.

332
00:26:03,577 --> 00:26:07,972  X1:152 X2:567 Y1:416 Y2:523
Bear in mind, they just
lost a third of their staff.
But they do have what we need?

333
00:26:08,016 --> 00:26:09,882  X1:272 X2:445 Y1:488 Y2:523
Yes, ma'am.

334
00:26:09,928 --> 00:26:11,643  X1:216 X2:501 Y1:488 Y2:523
Tell  them to hurry up.

335
00:26:11,688 --> 00:26:15,122  X1:202 X2:515 Y1:452 Y2:523
Here it is! Sally Jacobs,
blood group, A Positive.

336
00:26:15,165 --> 00:26:18,510  X1:122 X2:597 Y1:488 Y2:523
Who else walked out? Luke Parsons.

337
00:26:18,556 --> 00:26:21,832  X1:196 X2:523 Y1:488 Y2:523
Luke Parsons, A Positive!

338
00:26:21,875 --> 00:26:23,991  X1:250 X2:467 Y1:488 Y2:523
Geoffrey Baxter.

339
00:26:24,035 --> 00:26:26,830  X1:174 X2:545 Y1:488 Y2:523
Baxter, A Positive. That's it.

340
00:26:26,878 --> 00:26:31,621  X1:166 X2:551 Y1:416 Y2:523
They're all A Positive.
How many people in the world
are A Positive? No idea,

341
00:26:31,668 --> 00:26:33,811  X1:212 X2:505 Y1:488 Y2:523
but I bet it's one third.

342
00:26:33,856 --> 00:26:36,932  X1:168 X2:551 Y1:452 Y2:523
What's so special about that
blood group? Nothing, but...

343
00:26:36,975 --> 00:26:42,612  X1:170 X2:549 Y1:416 Y2:523
It's my fault. Guinevere One,
it's got one of those plaques,
identifying the human race.

344
00:26:42,657 --> 00:26:44,282  X1:204 X2:513 Y1:488 Y2:523
A message to the stars.

345
00:26:44,327 --> 00:26:48,842  X1:166 X2:551 Y1:416 Y2:523
You don't expect anything
to come of it, but I put on
maps and music and samples.

346
00:26:48,888 --> 00:26:51,200  X1:120 X2:597 Y1:488 Y2:523
There's wheat seeds and water and...

347
00:26:51,248 --> 00:26:53,831  X1:284 X2:433 Y1:488 Y2:523
And blood.

348
00:26:53,876 --> 00:26:56,072  X1:286 X2:433 Y1:488 Y2:523
A Positive.

349
00:26:56,115 --> 00:27:00,231  X1:186 X2:531 Y1:452 Y2:523
The Sycorax have got a vial
of A Positive,

350
00:27:00,276 --> 00:27:04,991  X1:136 X2:583 Y1:452 Y2:523
and, I don't know how, but through
that... They control the blood.

351
00:27:05,037 --> 00:27:08,963  X1:128 X2:589 Y1:452 Y2:523
Oh, my God. There's only one more
thing I can try. Major! With me!

352
00:27:11,546 --> 00:27:17,572  X1:132 X2:587 Y1:452 Y2:523
Ladies and gentlemen, if I may take
a moment during this terrible time.

353
00:27:17,618 --> 00:27:21,950  X1:154 X2:563 Y1:452 Y2:523
It's hardly the Queen's speech.
I'm afraid that's been cancelled.

354
00:27:22,767 --> 00:27:25,141  X1:134 X2:585 Y1:488 Y2:523
Did we ask about the Royal Family?

355
00:27:26,607 --> 00:27:28,281  X1:318 X2:401 Y1:488 Y2:523
Oh...

356
00:27:28,328 --> 00:27:31,022  X1:232 X2:487 Y1:488 Y2:523
they're on the roof.

357
00:27:31,885 --> 00:27:35,991  X1:182 X2:535 Y1:452 Y2:523
But, ladies and gentlemen,
this crisis is unique,

358
00:27:36,035 --> 00:27:39,670  X1:198 X2:521 Y1:452 Y2:523
and I'm afraid to say
it might get much worse.

359
00:27:39,715 --> 00:27:43,103  X1:138 X2:581 Y1:488 Y2:523
I would ask you all to remain calm.

360
00:27:43,148 --> 00:27:46,100  X1:208 X2:511 Y1:488 Y2:523
But I have one request.

361
00:27:46,145 --> 00:27:47,931  X1:304 X2:415 Y1:488 Y2:523
Doctor?

362
00:27:47,976 --> 00:27:51,411  X1:150 X2:569 Y1:488 Y2:523
If you're out there, we need you.

363
00:27:52,977 --> 00:27:55,691  X1:204 X2:515 Y1:488 Y2:523
I don't know what to do.

364
00:27:55,738 --> 00:28:01,321  X1:180 X2:537 Y1:416 Y2:523
If you can hear me, Doctor,
if anyone knows the Doctor,
if anyone can find him,

365
00:28:01,367 --> 00:28:04,772  X1:212 X2:507 Y1:452 Y2:523
the situation has never
been more desperate.

366
00:28:06,168 --> 00:28:08,430  X1:300 X2:419 Y1:488 Y2:523
Help us.

367
00:28:08,475 --> 00:28:11,682  X1:202 X2:517 Y1:488 Y2:523
Please, Doctor, help us.

368
00:28:26,466 --> 00:28:28,142  X1:286 X2:433 Y1:488 Y2:523
He's gone.

369
00:28:30,695 --> 00:28:33,410  X1:236 X2:481 Y1:488 Y2:523
The Doctor's gone.

370
00:28:33,458 --> 00:28:34,931  X1:230 X2:489 Y1:488 Y2:523
He's left me, Mum.

371
00:28:36,765 --> 00:28:38,290  X1:258 X2:461 Y1:488 Y2:523
Left me, Mum.

372
00:28:55,875 --> 00:28:59,553  X1:160 X2:559 Y1:452 Y2:523
Sonic wave! It's the spaceship,
it's hit the atmosphere!

373
00:29:05,296 --> 00:29:08,211  X1:078 X2:287 Y1:488 Y2:523
LOW RUMBLING

374
00:30:17,457 --> 00:30:19,501  X1:160 X2:559 Y1:488 Y2:523
Mickey, we're gonna carry him.

375
00:30:19,548 --> 00:30:22,771  X1:134 X2:583 Y1:452 Y2:523
Mum, get your stuff, and get some
food, we're going. Where to?

376
00:30:22,815 --> 00:30:27,372  X1:166 X2:553 Y1:416 Y2:523
The TARDIS. It's the only safe
place. What are we gonna do
in there? Hide. Is that it?

377
00:30:27,415 --> 00:30:32,803  X1:146 X2:573 Y1:416 Y2:523
Look in the sky. There's
a great big alien invasion
and I don't know what to do, OK?

378
00:30:32,846 --> 00:30:37,440  X1:156 X2:561 Y1:416 Y2:523
I've travelled with him and seen
all that stuff, but when
I'm stuck at home, I'm useless.

379
00:30:37,485 --> 00:30:41,253  X1:170 X2:547 Y1:452 Y2:523
All we can do is run and hide,
and I'm sorry. Now move!

380
00:30:44,158 --> 00:30:46,730  X1:148 X2:571 Y1:488 Y2:523
They're transmitting. On screen.

384
00:30:59,695 --> 00:31:02,170  X1:140 X2:579 Y1:488 Y2:523
I'm proud to represent this planet.

00:31:03,817 --> 00:31:05,770  X1:254 X2:463 Y1:488 Y2:523
"Come aboard!"

387
00:31:07,615 --> 00:31:09,451  X1:242 X2:477 Y1:488 Y2:523
How do I do that?

388
00:31:11,848 --> 00:31:14,441  X1:234 X2:483 Y1:488 Y2:523
What's happening?

389
00:31:14,486 --> 00:31:16,941  X1:192 X2:525 Y1:452 Y2:523
I would imagine it's called
a teleport.

391
00:31:36,816 --> 00:31:38,370  X1:268 X2:449 Y1:488 Y2:523
It's a helmet.

392
00:31:38,418 --> 00:31:40,670  X1:216 X2:503 Y1:488 Y2:523
They might be like us!

393
00:31:43,658 --> 00:31:45,090  X1:308 X2:411 Y1:488 Y2:523
Or not.

394
00:31:45,136 --> 00:31:47,923  X1:278 X2:439 Y1:488 Y2:523

395
00:31:56,475 --> 00:31:59,073  X1:168 X2:551 Y1:452 Y2:523
Mum, will you leave that stuff
and give us a hand?

396
00:31:59,116 --> 00:32:02,382  X1:166 X2:553 Y1:452 Y2:523
It's food. You said we need...
Just leave it!

399
00:32:12,305 --> 00:32:13,943  X1:176 X2:541 Y1:488 Y2:523
"and your people will jump."

400
00:32:13,988 --> 00:32:16,611  X1:254 X2:463 Y1:488 Y2:523
If I can speak...

401
00:32:16,657 --> 00:32:18,612  X1:134 X2:585 Y1:488 Y2:523
Mr Llewellyn, you're a civilian. No.

402
00:32:18,656 --> 00:32:21,483  X1:144 X2:575 Y1:452 Y2:523
I sent out the probe,
I made contact with these people.

403
00:32:21,526 --> 00:32:23,911  X1:128 X2:589 Y1:488 Y2:523
This whole thing's my responsibility.

404
00:32:25,286 --> 00:32:28,402  X1:244 X2:473 Y1:488 Y2:523
With respect, sir.

407
00:32:35,995 --> 00:32:38,110  X1:204 X2:515 Y1:488 Y2:523

00:32:38,156 --> 00:32:40,161  X1:158 X2:559 Y1:488 Y2:523
Children who need compassion.

409
00:32:41,668 --> 00:32:45,191  X1:210 X2:509 Y1:452 Y2:523
I beg of you now.
Show that compassion.

out of my head, like it's forbidden.

If it picks up TV, maybe
we can see what's going on.

00:34:37,748 --> 00:34:42,333  X1:114 X2:605 Y1:452 Y2:523

441
00:34:55,927 --> 00:34:59,241  X1:214 X2:505 Y1:452 Y2:523
They're accusing us of
hiding it, conspiring...

442
00:34:59,286 --> 00:35:00,320  X1:308 X2:411 Y1:488 Y2:523
.Kora.

443
00:35:00,366 --> 00:35:03,231  X1:254 X2:465 Y1:488 Y2:523
Kres ta forok si!

444
00:35:04,158 --> 00:35:05,762  X1:244 X2:475 Y1:488 Y2:523
Bring it on board!

445
00:35:09,465 --> 00:35:11,722  X1:312 X2:405 Y1:488 Y2:523
Rose?

446
00:35:12,947 --> 00:35:14,460  X1:316 X2:403 Y1:488 Y2:523
Rose!

447
00:35:21,696 --> 00:35:26,770  X1:130 X2:589 Y1:416 Y2:523
Maybe it's a distress signal. Fat
lot of good that's gonna do. Are
you gonna be a misery all the time?

448
00:35:26,817 --> 00:35:32,082  X1:128 X2:591 Y1:416 Y2:523
Yes. Look at it from my point of
view. Stuck in here with
your mum's cooking! Where is she?

449
00:35:32,127 --> 00:35:36,683  X1:136 X2:583 Y1:452 Y2:523
I'd better give her a hand. It might
start raining missiles out there.

450
00:35:36,727 --> 00:35:39,391  X1:216 X2:503 Y1:452 Y2:523
Tell her anything from
a tin, that's fine.

451
00:35:39,437 --> 00:35:44,801  X1:150 X2:567 Y1:452 Y2:523
Why don't you tell her yourself?
I'm not that brave. Oh, I dunno.

452
00:35:48,387 --> 00:35:49,701  X1:078 X2:283 Y1:488 Y2:523
ROSE SCREAMS

453
00:35:49,748 --> 00:35:53,421  X1:262 X2:457 Y1:488 Y2:523
Rose! Get off!

454
00:35:53,466 --> 00:35:55,860  X1:282 X2:437 Y1:488 Y2:523
Get off me!

455
00:35:55,906 --> 00:35:58,151  X1:192 X2:527 Y1:488 Y2:523
The door. Close the door!

456
00:36:15,046 --> 00:36:17,293  X1:306 X2:411 Y1:488 Y2:523
Yas vil!

457
00:36:19,597 --> 00:36:21,712  X1:272 X2:445 Y1:488 Y2:523
Rose! Rose!

458
00:36:21,757 --> 00:36:25,622  X1:154 X2:565 Y1:452 Y2:523
I've got you!
My Lord, oh, my precious thing.

459
00:36:25,667 --> 00:36:28,500  X1:184 X2:535 Y1:488 Y2:523
The Doctor, is he with you?

460
00:36:28,545 --> 00:36:30,822  X1:330 X2:389 Y1:488 Y2:523
No.

461
00:36:30,866 --> 00:36:33,192  X1:240 X2:479 Y1:488 Y2:523
We're on our own.

462
00:36:50,128 --> 00:36:52,372  X1:078 X2:239 Y1:488 Y2:523

She has the clever blue box.

467
00:37:08,108 --> 00:37:10,620  X1:210 X2:509 Y1:452 Y2:523
"Therefore, she speaks
for your planet."

468
00:37:10,665 --> 00:37:12,692  X1:184 X2:533 Y1:488 Y2:523
But she can't. Yeah, I can.

469
00:37:12,736 --> 00:37:15,410  X1:182 X2:535 Y1:452 Y2:523
Don't you dare. Someone's
gotta be the Doctor.

470
00:37:15,456 --> 00:37:17,623  X1:230 X2:489 Y1:452 Y2:523
They'll kill you.
Never stopped him.

476
00:37:39,985 --> 00:37:41,782  X1:136 X2:583 Y1:488 Y2:523
I command you to leave this world,

499
00:38:57,067 --> 00:38:59,600  X1:190 X2:529 Y1:488 Y2:523
and your people enslaved.

500
00:39:01,148 --> 00:39:04,903  X1:206 X2:511 Y1:416 Y2:523
Hold on, that's English.
He's talking English.
You're talking English.

501
00:39:04,946 --> 00:39:07,732  X1:170 X2:549 Y1:452 Y2:523
I would never dirty my tongue
with your primitive bile!

502
00:39:07,777 --> 00:39:09,893  X1:216 X2:501 Y1:452 Y2:523
But that's English!
Can you hear English?

503
00:39:09,937 --> 00:39:12,162  X1:140 X2:579 Y1:488 Y2:523
Yeah. English. Definitely English.

504
00:39:12,207 --> 00:39:14,602  X1:214 X2:505 Y1:488 Y2:523
I speak only Sycoraxic!

505
00:39:14,647 --> 00:39:17,120  X1:226 X2:493 Y1:488 Y2:523
If I can hear English,

506
00:39:17,167 --> 00:39:19,563  X1:192 X2:527 Y1:488 Y2:523
then it's being translated,

507
00:39:19,608 --> 00:39:21,483  X1:194 X2:525 Y1:488 Y2:523
which means it's working,

508
00:39:21,526 --> 00:39:23,001  X1:256 X2:461 Y1:488 Y2:523
which means...

509
00:39:30,107 --> 00:39:31,911  X1:242 X2:477 Y1:488 Y2:523
Did you miss me?

510
00:39:32,837 --> 00:39:34,341  X1:274 X2:443 Y1:488 Y2:523
Rrrraaaargh!

511
00:39:37,506 --> 00:39:40,862  X1:164 X2:555 Y1:452 Y2:523
You could have someone's eye
out with that! How dare...

512
00:39:44,378 --> 00:39:48,453  X1:184 X2:535 Y1:452 Y2:523
You just can't get the staff.
Now you, just wait!

513
00:39:48,497 --> 00:39:50,821  X1:294 X2:423 Y1:488 Y2:523
I'm busy.

514
00:39:51,448 --> 00:39:53,681  X1:264 X2:455 Y1:488 Y2:523
Mickey, hello!

515
00:39:53,726 --> 00:39:55,841  X1:220 X2:499 Y1:452 Y2:523
And Harriet Jones,
MP for Flydale North.

516
00:39:55,887 --> 00:39:58,321  X1:148 X2:569 Y1:452 Y2:523
Blimey, it's like This Is Your Life.
Tea!

517
00:39:58,367 --> 00:40:03,351  X1:128 X2:589 Y1:416 Y2:523
That's all I needed, good cup of tea,
a superheated infusion
of free radicals and tannin.

518
00:40:03,398 --> 00:40:06,590  X1:216 X2:503 Y1:452 Y2:523
Just the thing to heal
the synapses. Now...

519
00:40:06,636 --> 00:40:09,300  X1:164 X2:555 Y1:488 Y2:523
First things first. Be honest...

520
00:40:09,347 --> 00:40:12,260  X1:214 X2:505 Y1:488 Y2:523
How do I look? Um...

521
00:40:12,308 --> 00:40:15,383  X1:156 X2:563 Y1:452 Y2:523
Different.
Good different or bad different?

522
00:40:15,428 --> 00:40:17,021  X1:266 X2:451 Y1:488 Y2:523
Just different.

523
00:40:17,065 --> 00:40:18,421  X1:306 X2:411 Y1:488 Y2:523
Am I...

524
00:40:18,468 --> 00:40:19,892  X1:304 X2:415 Y1:488 Y2:523
ginger?

525
00:40:21,105 --> 00:40:23,373  X1:170 X2:549 Y1:488 Y2:523
No, you're just sort of brown.

526
00:40:23,416 --> 00:40:25,613  X1:210 X2:509 Y1:452 Y2:523
I wanted to be ginger.
I've never been ginger.

527
00:40:25,656 --> 00:40:29,961  X1:126 X2:591 Y1:416 Y2:523
And you, Rose Tyler, fat lot of
good you were! You gave up on me.
Ooh, that's rude.

528
00:40:30,006 --> 00:40:33,962  X1:142 X2:577 Y1:452 Y2:523
Is that the sort of man I am now?
Am I rude? Rude and not ginger?

529
00:40:34,008 --> 00:40:37,361  X1:152 X2:567 Y1:452 Y2:523
I'm sorry, who is this?
I'm the Doctor. He's the Doctor.

530
00:40:37,405 --> 00:40:41,473  X1:130 X2:589 Y1:452 Y2:523
What happened to my Doctor? Or is
it a title that's just passed on?

531
00:40:41,516 --> 00:40:43,633  X1:190 X2:529 Y1:488 Y2:523
I'm him. I'm literally him.

532
00:40:43,676 --> 00:40:46,303  X1:216 X2:501 Y1:452 Y2:523
Same man, new face.
Well, new everything.

533
00:40:46,347 --> 00:40:48,663  X1:144 X2:575 Y1:488 Y2:523
But you can't be... Harriet Jones.

534
00:40:48,707 --> 00:40:53,780  X1:130 X2:589 Y1:416 Y2:523
We were trapped in Downing Street,
and the thing that scared you
wasn't the aliens, wasn't the war,

535
00:40:53,825 --> 00:40:57,222  X1:146 X2:573 Y1:452 Y2:523
it was the thought of your mother
being on her own. Oh, my God!

536
00:40:57,268 --> 00:41:00,732  X1:196 X2:521 Y1:452 Y2:523
Did you win the election?
Landslide majority.

537
00:41:00,778 --> 00:41:02,492  X1:222 X2:497 Y1:488 Y2:523
If I might interrupt...

538
00:41:02,537 --> 00:41:04,773  X1:178 X2:539 Y1:488 Y2:523
Yes, sorry. Hello, big fella.

539
00:41:04,816 --> 00:41:07,292  X1:220 X2:499 Y1:488 Y2:523
Who exactly are you?

540
00:41:07,336 --> 00:41:08,852  X1:194 X2:525 Y1:488 Y2:523
Well, that's the question.

541
00:41:08,896 --> 00:41:11,083  X1:160 X2:559 Y1:488 Y2:523
I demand to know who you are!

542
00:41:11,127 --> 00:41:12,612  X1:272 X2:447 Y1:488 Y2:523
I don't know!

543
00:41:14,888 --> 00:41:19,122  X1:138 X2:579 Y1:452 Y2:523
That's the thing. I'm the Doctor,
but beyond that, I just don't know.

544
00:41:19,168 --> 00:41:21,712  X1:154 X2:565 Y1:488 Y2:523
I literally do not know who I am.

545
00:41:21,755 --> 00:41:24,100  X1:168 X2:551 Y1:488 Y2:523
It's all untested. Am I funny?

546
00:41:24,146 --> 00:41:26,740  X1:212 X2:507 Y1:488 Y2:523
Am I sarcastic? Sexy?

547
00:41:26,786 --> 00:41:31,151  X1:140 X2:579 Y1:452 Y2:523
A right old misery? Life and soul?
Right handed, left handed?

548
00:41:31,198 --> 00:41:34,813  X1:146 X2:573 Y1:452 Y2:523
A gambler, a fighter, a coward,
a traitor, a liar, a nervous wreck?

549
00:41:34,855 --> 00:41:37,943  X1:202 X2:517 Y1:452 Y2:523
Judging by the evidence,
I've certainly got a gob.

550
00:41:37,985 --> 00:41:42,122  X1:180 X2:539 Y1:452 Y2:523
And how am I going to react
when I see this?

551
00:41:42,166 --> 00:41:46,160  X1:160 X2:557 Y1:488 Y2:523
A great big threatening button.

552
00:41:46,206 --> 00:41:51,763  X1:120 X2:599 Y1:416 Y2:523
A Great Big Threatening Button
Which Must Not Be Pressed
Under Any Circumstances, am I right?

553
00:41:51,807 --> 00:41:56,071  X1:176 X2:543 Y1:416 Y2:523
Let me guess, it's some sort
of control matrix.
Hold on, what's feeding it?

554
00:41:56,118 --> 00:41:59,742  X1:202 X2:515 Y1:488 Y2:523
What have we got here?

555
00:41:59,788 --> 00:42:01,753  X1:308 X2:411 Y1:488 Y2:523
Blood?

556
00:42:01,798 --> 00:42:06,943  X1:136 X2:581 Y1:452 Y2:523
Definitely blood, human blood,
A Positive, with just a dash of iron.

557
00:42:06,988 --> 00:42:08,143  X1:242 X2:477 Y1:488 Y2:523
But that means...

558
00:42:08,188 --> 00:42:10,823  X1:170 X2:549 Y1:488 Y2:523
Blood control. Blood control!

559
00:42:10,868 --> 00:42:13,863  X1:208 X2:511 Y1:452 Y2:523
Oh, I haven't seen
blood control for years!

560
00:42:13,907 --> 00:42:16,373  X1:236 X2:483 Y1:452 Y2:523
You're controlling
all the A Positives!

561
00:42:16,416 --> 00:42:20,100  X1:184 X2:533 Y1:452 Y2:523
Which leaves us with a
great big stinking problem.

562
00:42:20,148 --> 00:42:22,560  X1:150 X2:569 Y1:488 Y2:523
Cos I really don't know who I am.

563
00:42:22,608 --> 00:42:25,250  X1:188 X2:529 Y1:488 Y2:523
I don't know when to stop.

564
00:42:25,298 --> 00:42:29,753  X1:148 X2:571 Y1:416 Y2:523
So if I see a great big threatening
button, which should never,
ever, ever be pressed,

565
00:42:29,796 --> 00:42:32,221  X1:166 X2:553 Y1:488 Y2:523
then I just wanna do this! No!

566
00:42:39,347 --> 00:42:41,462  X1:142 X2:577 Y1:488 Y2:523
What the hell am I doing up here?

567
00:42:41,507 --> 00:42:43,112  X1:200 X2:519 Y1:488 Y2:523
Get away from the edge!

568
00:42:47,268 --> 00:42:51,730  X1:134 X2:585 Y1:416 Y2:523
You killed them! What d'you think,
big fella? Are they dead?
We allow them to live.

569
00:42:51,778 --> 00:42:54,411  X1:188 X2:529 Y1:488 Y2:523
Allow?! You've no choice!

570
00:42:54,455 --> 00:42:57,372  X1:192 X2:527 Y1:452 Y2:523
That's all blood control is,
a cheap bit of voodoo.

571
00:42:57,417 --> 00:43:02,243  X1:114 X2:603 Y1:416 Y2:523
Scary, but that's it. It's like
hypnosis. You can hypnotise someone
to walk like a chicken

572
00:43:02,286 --> 00:43:06,242  X1:174 X2:545 Y1:416 Y2:523
but you can't hypnotise them
to death.
Survival instinct's too strong.

573
00:43:06,285 --> 00:43:08,673  X1:190 X2:529 Y1:452 Y2:523
Blood control was just one
form of conquest.

574
00:43:08,718 --> 00:43:11,831  X1:178 X2:541 Y1:452 Y2:523
I can summon the Armada
and take this world by force.

575
00:43:11,878 --> 00:43:14,871  X1:128 X2:591 Y1:452 Y2:523
Yeah, you could.
You could do that, course you could.

576
00:43:14,915 --> 00:43:17,312  X1:288 X2:429 Y1:488 Y2:523
But why?!

577
00:43:17,356 --> 00:43:20,021  X1:218 X2:501 Y1:452 Y2:523
Look at these people.
These human beings.

578
00:43:20,066 --> 00:43:22,823  X1:204 X2:515 Y1:488 Y2:523
Consider their potential.

579
00:43:22,866 --> 00:43:27,731  X1:186 X2:533 Y1:416 Y2:523
>From the day they arrive
on the planet, and blinking
step into the sun,

580
00:43:27,775 --> 00:43:30,933  X1:212 X2:507 Y1:452 Y2:523
there is more to see
than can ever be seen,

581
00:43:30,978 --> 00:43:33,312  X1:150 X2:567 Y1:488 Y2:523
more to do than... No, hold on.

582
00:43:34,817 --> 00:43:37,052  X1:186 X2:531 Y1:488 Y2:523
Sorry, that's the Lion King.

583
00:43:37,097 --> 00:43:39,083  X1:196 X2:523 Y1:488 Y2:523
But the point still stands.

584
00:43:39,125 --> 00:43:41,681  X1:238 X2:481 Y1:452 Y2:523
Leave them alone.
Or what?

585
00:43:41,727 --> 00:43:43,243  X1:320 X2:397 Y1:488 Y2:523
Or...

586
00:43:47,676 --> 00:43:49,311  X1:254 X2:465 Y1:488 Y2:523
I challenge you!

587
00:43:49,356 --> 00:43:52,553  X1:078 X2:297 Y1:488 Y2:523
SYCORAX LAUGH

588
00:43:52,596 --> 00:43:55,071  X1:188 X2:531 Y1:488 Y2:523
Ohh, that's struck a chord.

589
00:43:55,117 --> 00:43:58,500  X1:142 X2:577 Y1:452 Y2:523
Am I right that the sanctified rules
of combat still apply?

590
00:43:58,548 --> 00:44:02,290  X1:200 X2:519 Y1:452 Y2:523
You stand as this world's
champion?

591
00:44:02,338 --> 00:44:03,613  X1:284 X2:433 Y1:488 Y2:523
Thank you.

592
00:44:03,655 --> 00:44:07,212  X1:158 X2:561 Y1:452 Y2:523
I've no idea who I am,
but you've just summed me up.

593
00:44:07,256 --> 00:44:09,573  X1:190 X2:529 Y1:488 Y2:523
D'you accept my challenge

594
00:44:09,615 --> 00:44:12,810  X1:186 X2:533 Y1:452 Y2:523
or are you just a cranak pel
casackree salvak?

595
00:44:13,686 --> 00:44:15,942  X1:078 X2:293 Y1:488 Y2:523
SYCORAX CHEER

596
00:44:19,527 --> 00:44:22,443  X1:234 X2:461 Y1:452 Y2:523
For the planet?
For the planet!

597
00:44:22,487 --> 00:44:24,900  X1:078 X2:293 Y1:488 Y2:523
SYCORAX CHEER

598
00:44:34,868 --> 00:44:36,881  X1:284 X2:435 Y1:488 Y2:523
Ha haaaaa!

599
00:44:47,138 --> 00:44:48,623  X1:294 X2:425 Y1:488 Y2:523
Look out!

600
00:44:48,668 --> 00:44:51,443  X1:144 X2:575 Y1:452 Y2:523
Yeah, that helps. I wouldn't have
thought of that.

601
00:44:55,888 --> 00:44:58,182  X1:280 X2:439 Y1:488 Y2:523
Rrraaaargh!

602
00:45:01,357 --> 00:45:03,122  X1:256 X2:463 Y1:488 Y2:523
Bit of fresh air?

603
00:45:21,696 --> 00:45:26,052  X1:134 X2:583 Y1:452 Y2:523
Stay back! Invalidate the challenge
and he wins the planet.

604
00:45:26,096 --> 00:45:28,490  X1:298 X2:421 Y1:488 Y2:523
Yaaargh!

605
00:45:28,535 --> 00:45:31,083  X1:290 X2:429 Y1:488 Y2:523
Raaaargh!

606
00:45:49,228 --> 00:45:50,861  X1:206 X2:511 Y1:488 Y2:523
You've cut my hand off!

607
00:45:50,908 --> 00:45:54,060  X1:268 X2:451 Y1:488 Y2:523
Jah! Sycorax!

608
00:45:55,187 --> 00:45:57,373  X1:112 X2:607 Y1:488 Y2:523
And now I know what sort of man I am.

609
00:45:57,417 --> 00:46:03,930  X1:158 X2:561 Y1:416 Y2:523
I'm lucky. Cos quite by chance,
I'm still within the first 15
hours of my regeneration cycle,

610
00:46:03,978 --> 00:46:09,301  X1:142 X2:577 Y1:452 Y2:523
which means I've got just enough
residual cellular energy to do this.

611
00:46:16,237 --> 00:46:18,150  X1:286 X2:433 Y1:488 Y2:523
Witchcraft.

612
00:46:18,195 --> 00:46:20,733  X1:286 X2:433 Y1:488 Y2:523
Time Lord.

613
00:46:21,797 --> 00:46:23,383  X1:306 X2:411 Y1:488 Y2:523
Doctor!

614
00:46:25,148 --> 00:46:26,983  X1:172 X2:547 Y1:488 Y2:523
So I'm still the Doctor, then?

615
00:46:27,025 --> 00:46:29,541  X1:192 X2:527 Y1:452 Y2:523
No arguments from me!
Wanna know the best bit?

616
00:46:29,585 --> 00:46:32,371  X1:236 X2:483 Y1:452 Y2:523
This new hand...
It's a fightin' hand!

617
00:46:48,725 --> 00:46:49,842  X1:318 X2:401 Y1:488 Y2:523
I win.

618
00:46:49,885 --> 00:46:52,390  X1:270 X2:447 Y1:488 Y2:523
Then kill me.

619
00:46:52,438 --> 00:46:56,871  X1:158 X2:561 Y1:452 Y2:523
I'll spare your life if you'll
take this champion's command.

620
00:46:56,915 --> 00:47:00,472  X1:130 X2:587 Y1:488 Y2:523
Leave this planet, and never return.

621
00:47:00,516 --> 00:47:03,220  X1:244 X2:475 Y1:452 Y2:523
What do you say?
Yes.

622
00:47:03,266 --> 00:47:06,130  X1:134 X2:585 Y1:488 Y2:523
Swear on the blood of your species!

623
00:47:07,786 --> 00:47:10,463  X1:302 X2:415 Y1:488 Y2:523
I swear.

624
00:47:10,505 --> 00:47:13,022  X1:162 X2:557 Y1:452 Y2:523
There we are. Thanks for that.
Cheers, big fella.

625
00:47:13,067 --> 00:47:16,051  X1:210 X2:509 Y1:488 Y2:523
Bravo! That says it all.

626
00:47:16,097 --> 00:47:17,573  X1:312 X2:407 Y1:488 Y2:523
Bravo!

627
00:47:17,616 --> 00:47:19,292  X1:140 X2:579 Y1:488 Y2:523
Not bad for a man in his jim-jams.

628
00:47:19,338 --> 00:47:22,280  X1:186 X2:533 Y1:452 Y2:523
Very Arthur Dent.
Now there was a nice man.

629
00:47:22,326 --> 00:47:26,203  X1:146 X2:573 Y1:452 Y2:523
Hold on, what have I got in here?
A satsuma!

630
00:47:26,248 --> 00:47:29,241  X1:174 X2:543 Y1:452 Y2:523
That friend of your mother's,
he does like his snacks.

631
00:47:29,287 --> 00:47:31,312  X1:128 X2:589 Y1:488 Y2:523
Doesn't that just sum up Christmas?

632
00:47:31,358 --> 00:47:34,270  X1:138 X2:581 Y1:452 Y2:523
You go through all those presents,
and right at the end,

633
00:47:34,317 --> 00:47:37,870  X1:136 X2:583 Y1:452 Y2:523
tucked away at the bottom, there's
always one stupid old satsuma.

634
00:47:37,918 --> 00:47:39,803  X1:210 X2:509 Y1:452 Y2:523
Who wants a satsuma?
Raaaargh!

635
00:47:41,665 --> 00:47:43,582  X1:290 X2:429 Y1:488 Y2:523
Aaaaargh!

636
00:47:43,627 --> 00:47:47,553  X1:212 X2:505 Y1:452 Y2:523
No second chances.
I'm that sort of a man.

637
00:47:54,018 --> 00:48:00,203  X1:162 X2:557 Y1:416 Y2:523
By the ancient rites of combat,
I forbid you to scavenge here
for the rest of time.

638
00:48:00,248 --> 00:48:03,923  X1:142 X2:577 Y1:452 Y2:523
And when you go back to the stars
and tell others of this planet,

639
00:48:03,967 --> 00:48:09,112  X1:158 X2:559 Y1:452 Y2:523
when you tell them of its riches
its people, its potential...

640
00:48:09,155 --> 00:48:11,830  X1:184 X2:535 Y1:488 Y2:523
When you talk of the Earth,

641
00:48:11,878 --> 00:48:14,671  X1:136 X2:583 Y1:488 Y2:523
make sure that you tell them this -

642
00:48:14,718 --> 00:48:18,351  X1:262 X2:455 Y1:488 Y2:523
it is defended.

643
00:48:24,667 --> 00:48:26,250  X1:260 X2:459 Y1:488 Y2:523
Where are we?

644
00:48:26,298 --> 00:48:28,291  X1:172 X2:547 Y1:488 Y2:523
We're just off Bloxham Road.

645
00:48:28,338 --> 00:48:30,412  X1:180 X2:539 Y1:452 Y2:523
We're just round the corner.
We did it!

646
00:48:30,458 --> 00:48:32,292  X1:168 X2:551 Y1:488 Y2:523
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

647
00:48:40,326 --> 00:48:43,360  X1:196 X2:523 Y1:488 Y2:523
Go on, my son! Oh, yes!

648
00:48:43,405 --> 00:48:46,030  X1:214 X2:503 Y1:488 Y2:523
Yes, don't come back!

649
00:48:46,078 --> 00:48:47,540  X1:262 X2:457 Y1:488 Y2:523
It is defended!

650
00:48:57,948 --> 00:49:00,933  X1:182 X2:537 Y1:488 Y2:523
My Doctor. Prime Minister!

651
00:49:05,055 --> 00:49:07,402  X1:190 X2:529 Y1:488 Y2:523
Absolutely the same man.

652
00:49:11,408 --> 00:49:13,971  X1:152 X2:567 Y1:488 Y2:523
Are there many more out there?

653
00:49:14,015 --> 00:49:16,960  X1:248 X2:471 Y1:488 Y2:523
Not just Sycorax.

654
00:49:17,007 --> 00:49:20,323  X1:222 X2:495 Y1:452 Y2:523
Hundreds of species,
thousands of 'em.

655
00:49:21,796 --> 00:49:24,753  X1:188 X2:531 Y1:452 Y2:523
And the human race is
drawing attention to itself.

656
00:49:24,795 --> 00:49:27,632  X1:120 X2:599 Y1:488 Y2:523
Every day, you're sending out probes,

657
00:49:27,678 --> 00:49:29,420  X1:212 X2:505 Y1:488 Y2:523
messages and signals.

658
00:49:29,465 --> 00:49:34,303  X1:212 X2:507 Y1:452 Y2:523
This planet's so noisy.
You're getting noticed.

659
00:49:34,347 --> 00:49:35,832  X1:252 X2:465 Y1:488 Y2:523
More and more.

660
00:49:37,585 --> 00:49:39,781  X1:184 X2:533 Y1:488 Y2:523
You'd better get used to it.

661
00:49:39,827 --> 00:49:45,432  X1:150 X2:567 Y1:452 Y2:523
Rose! Mum! Talking of trouble.
Oh, my God! We did it, mum!

662
00:49:46,617 --> 00:49:50,323  X1:168 X2:551 Y1:452 Y2:523
You did it too! It was the tea!
Fixed his head!

663
00:49:50,365 --> 00:49:53,723  X1:158 X2:559 Y1:452 Y2:523
That's all I needed! Cup of tea!
I said so! And look at him!

664
00:49:53,767 --> 00:49:56,760  X1:214 X2:505 Y1:452 Y2:523
Is it him, though?
Is it really the Doctor?

665
00:49:58,928 --> 00:50:03,500  X1:146 X2:573 Y1:452 Y2:523
Oh, my God, it's the bleedin'
Prime Minister! Come here, you!

666
00:50:06,278 --> 00:50:07,792  X1:254 X2:463 Y1:488 Y2:523
Are you better?

667
00:50:11,627 --> 00:50:14,343  X1:156 X2:563 Y1:488 Y2:523
It's a message from Torchwood.

668
00:50:14,388 --> 00:50:16,883  X1:210 X2:509 Y1:488 Y2:523
They say they're ready.

669
00:50:20,375 --> 00:50:24,232  X1:214 X2:503 Y1:452 Y2:523
You left me. Sorry.
And I had all the food!

670
00:50:25,858 --> 00:50:27,453  X1:246 X2:471 Y1:488 Y2:523
Tell them to fire.

671
00:50:32,166 --> 00:50:33,692  X1:282 X2:437 Y1:488 Y2:523
Fire at will.

672
00:51:06,845 --> 00:51:09,683  X1:144 X2:575 Y1:488 Y2:523
What is that? What's happening?

673
00:51:16,435 --> 00:51:18,992  X1:126 X2:593 Y1:488 Y2:523
That was murder. That was defence.

674
00:51:19,035 --> 00:51:25,353  X1:136 X2:581 Y1:416 Y2:523
It's adapted from alien technology,
a ship that fell to Earth ten
years ago. But they were leaving!

675
00:51:25,395 --> 00:51:30,343  X1:158 X2:561 Y1:416 Y2:523
You said yourself, Doctor,
they'd go back to the stars
and tell others about the Earth.

676
00:51:30,387 --> 00:51:33,450  X1:152 X2:565 Y1:452 Y2:523
I'm sorry, Doctor, but you're not
here all the time.

677
00:51:33,496 --> 00:51:37,733  X1:156 X2:563 Y1:416 Y2:523
It happened today.
Mr Llewellyn and the Major,
they were murdered, they died,

678
00:51:37,775 --> 00:51:40,570  X1:200 X2:519 Y1:452 Y2:523
right in front of me
while you were sleeping.

679
00:51:40,618 --> 00:51:45,363  X1:150 X2:569 Y1:452 Y2:523
In which case, we have to defend
ourselves. Britain's golden age.

680
00:51:45,406 --> 00:51:48,830  X1:158 X2:561 Y1:452 Y2:523
It comes with a price.
I gave them the wrong warning.

681
00:51:48,876 --> 00:51:52,472  X1:148 X2:571 Y1:452 Y2:523
I should have told them to run,
as fast as they can, run and hide.

682
00:51:52,516 --> 00:51:55,391  X1:138 X2:579 Y1:452 Y2:523
Because the monsters are coming.
The human race.

683
00:51:55,437 --> 00:51:58,430  X1:146 X2:573 Y1:452 Y2:523
Those are the people I represent.
I did it on their behalf.

684
00:51:58,478 --> 00:52:01,632  X1:138 X2:581 Y1:452 Y2:523
And I should have stopped you.
What does that make you, Doctor?

685
00:52:01,677 --> 00:52:03,343  X1:220 X2:499 Y1:488 Y2:523
Another alien threat?

686
00:52:03,387 --> 00:52:07,180  X1:140 X2:579 Y1:452 Y2:523
Don't challenge me, Harriet Jones.
Cos I'm a completely new man.

687
00:52:07,227 --> 00:52:10,941  X1:132 X2:587 Y1:452 Y2:523
I could bring down your government
with a single word.

688
00:52:10,985 --> 00:52:14,132  X1:150 X2:569 Y1:452 Y2:523
You're the most remarkable man
I've ever met.

689
00:52:15,615 --> 00:52:18,212  X1:212 X2:507 Y1:452 Y2:523
But I don't think you're
quite capable of that.

690
00:52:18,256 --> 00:52:21,162  X1:128 X2:589 Y1:488 Y2:523
No, you're right. Not a single word.

691
00:52:22,406 --> 00:52:25,323  X1:184 X2:535 Y1:452 Y2:523
Just six.
I don't think so. Six words.

692
00:52:25,367 --> 00:52:26,971  X1:274 X2:443 Y1:488 Y2:523
Stop it. Six.

693
00:52:38,146 --> 00:52:40,600  X1:156 X2:563 Y1:488 Y2:523
Don't you think she looks tired?

694
00:52:54,256 --> 00:52:56,693  X1:216 X2:501 Y1:452 Y2:523
What did he say?
Nothing really, just...

695
00:52:56,735 --> 00:52:59,450  X1:140 X2:577 Y1:452 Y2:523
What did he say?!
Nothing, I don't know... Doctor?!

696
00:52:59,495 --> 00:53:01,403  X1:204 X2:515 Y1:488 Y2:523
Doctor! What did you...

697
00:53:01,445 --> 00:53:04,520  X1:142 X2:575 Y1:452 Y2:523
What was that? What did he say?
What did you say, Doctor?!

698
00:53:04,567 --> 00:53:06,121  X1:306 X2:411 Y1:488 Y2:523
Doctor!

699
00:53:09,275 --> 00:53:11,043  X1:292 X2:427 Y1:488 Y2:523
I'm sorry.

700
00:53:22,626 --> 00:53:25,410  X1:202 X2:515 Y1:488 Y2:523
# Well, I woke up today

701
00:53:25,945 --> 00:53:31,011  X1:204 X2:515 Y1:452 Y2:523
# And the world
seemed a restless place

702
00:53:31,576 --> 00:53:37,020  X1:224 X2:495 Y1:452 Y2:523
# It could have been
that way for me

703
00:53:38,805 --> 00:53:42,203  X1:196 X2:523 Y1:488 Y2:523
# And I wandered around

704
00:53:43,207 --> 00:53:46,512  X1:186 X2:533 Y1:488 Y2:523
# And thought of your face

705
00:53:46,556 --> 00:53:51,591  X1:236 X2:483 Y1:452 Y2:523
# That Christmas,
looking back at me

706
00:53:51,636 --> 00:53:54,420  X1:204 X2:513 Y1:488 Y2:523
# Ah, ah, ah-ah-ah-ah

707
00:53:54,468 --> 00:54:00,083  X1:184 X2:535 Y1:452 Y2:523
# I wish today was just like
every other day

708
00:54:01,626 --> 00:54:05,251  X1:138 X2:579 Y1:488 Y2:523
# Cos today has been the best day

709
00:54:05,295 --> 00:54:08,930  X1:176 X2:543 Y1:488 Y2:523
# Everything I ever dreamed

710
00:54:08,977 --> 00:54:11,612  X1:208 X2:509 Y1:488 Y2:523
# And I started to walk

711
00:54:11,658 --> 00:54:15,643  X1:218 X2:501 Y1:488 Y2:523
# Very soon I will run

712
00:54:15,688 --> 00:54:20,883  X1:150 X2:569 Y1:488 Y2:523
# And I'll be running back to you

713
00:54:23,636 --> 00:54:27,111  X1:200 X2:517 Y1:488 Y2:523
# Cos I followed my star

714
00:54:27,155 --> 00:54:30,513  X1:192 X2:527 Y1:488 Y2:523
# And that's what you are

715
00:54:31,147 --> 00:54:36,303  X1:154 X2:565 Y1:488 Y2:523
# I've led a merry time with you

716
00:54:36,348 --> 00:54:39,261  X1:168 X2:551 Y1:488 Y2:523
# Ah, ah, ah-ah-ah-ah... #

717
00:54:39,305 --> 00:54:40,783  X1:248 X2:471 Y1:488 Y2:523
Oh, that's yours.

718
00:54:40,826 --> 00:54:43,252  X1:184 X2:535 Y1:452 Y2:523
# I wish today was just like
every other day... #

719
00:54:43,295 --> 00:54:46,122  X1:174 X2:543 Y1:488 Y2:523
It's pink! It should be yours.

720
00:54:48,326 --> 00:54:50,442  X1:206 X2:513 Y1:488 Y2:523
Look, it's Harriet Jones!

721
00:54:50,485 --> 00:54:53,323  X1:154 X2:565 Y1:452 Y2:523
TV: Is it true you're no longer fit
to be in position?

722
00:54:53,368 --> 00:54:55,002  X1:126 X2:593 Y1:380 Y2:415
No. Can we talk about other things?

723
00:54:55,045 --> 00:54:57,842  X1:158 X2:559 Y1:488 Y2:523
Is it true you're unfit for office?

724
00:54:57,887 --> 00:55:02,712  X1:162 X2:557 Y1:416 Y2:523
There is nothing wrong with
my health. I don't know where
these stories are coming from

725
00:55:02,758 --> 00:55:05,391  X1:184 X2:535 Y1:452 Y2:523
and a vote of no confidence
is unjustified.

726
00:55:05,437 --> 00:55:07,071  X1:078 X2:465 Y1:452 Y2:523
PHONE RINGS
Will you resign?

727
00:55:07,117 --> 00:55:11,541  X1:158 X2:561 Y1:416 Y2:523
On today of all days, I'm fine.
I'm fine! Look at me! I'm fine!
I look fine, I feel fine.

728
00:55:11,588 --> 00:55:14,420  X1:174 X2:543 Y1:452 Y2:523
It's Bev. She says,
"Go and look outside." Why?

729
00:55:14,468 --> 00:55:17,051  X1:144 X2:575 Y1:452 Y2:523
I dunno, just go outside and look.
Come on, shift!

730
00:55:19,256 --> 00:55:21,093  X1:288 X2:431 Y1:488 Y2:523
Wow! Oh!

731
00:55:21,138 --> 00:55:23,601  X1:318 X2:401 Y1:488 Y2:523
Wow!

732
00:55:31,367 --> 00:55:34,640  X1:196 X2:521 Y1:452 Y2:523
That's beautiful.
What are they, meteors?

733
00:55:34,686 --> 00:55:38,350  X1:158 X2:561 Y1:452 Y2:523
It's the spaceship.
Breaking up in the atmosphere.

734
00:55:38,395 --> 00:55:40,753  X1:204 X2:515 Y1:488 Y2:523
This isn't snow, it's ash.

735
00:55:40,796 --> 00:55:43,713  X1:222 X2:495 Y1:488 Y2:523
OK, not so beautiful.

736
00:55:43,755 --> 00:55:46,982  X1:122 X2:597 Y1:488 Y2:523
And this is a brand-new Planet Earth.

737
00:55:47,028 --> 00:55:50,983  X1:176 X2:541 Y1:452 Y2:523
No denying the existence of
aliens now, everyone saw it.

738
00:55:51,026 --> 00:55:55,532  X1:132 X2:587 Y1:452 Y2:523
Everything's new. What about you?
What are you gonna do next?

739
00:55:55,576 --> 00:55:58,413  X1:308 X2:411 Y1:488 Y2:523
Well...

740
00:55:58,455 --> 00:56:00,870  X1:136 X2:583 Y1:488 Y2:523
Back to the TARDIS. Same old life.

741
00:56:02,217 --> 00:56:06,683  X1:106 X2:613 Y1:452 Y2:523
On your own? Don't you want to come?
Well, yeah. Do you, though? Yeah.

742
00:56:06,725 --> 00:56:08,762  X1:254 X2:465 Y1:488 Y2:523
I just thought...

743
00:56:08,806 --> 00:56:13,243  X1:144 X2:575 Y1:416 Y2:523
Cos I changed.
I thought, cos you changed,
you might not want me any more.

744
00:56:13,286 --> 00:56:17,492  X1:140 X2:577 Y1:452 Y2:523
I'd love you to come. OK!
You're never gonna stay, are you?

745
00:56:18,595 --> 00:56:21,351  X1:160 X2:559 Y1:488 Y2:523
There's just so much out there.

746
00:56:21,397 --> 00:56:22,910  X1:252 X2:467 Y1:488 Y2:523
So much to see.

747
00:56:22,957 --> 00:56:24,740  X1:284 X2:435 Y1:488 Y2:523
I've got to.

748
00:56:24,787 --> 00:56:26,580  X1:316 X2:403 Y1:488 Y2:523
Yeah.

749
00:56:26,628 --> 00:56:28,421  X1:226 X2:493 Y1:488 Y2:523
I reckon you're mad.

750
00:56:28,468 --> 00:56:31,503  X1:188 X2:531 Y1:452 Y2:523
The pair of you. It's like
you go looking for trouble.

751
00:56:31,547 --> 00:56:34,090  X1:142 X2:577 Y1:488 Y2:523
Trouble's just the bits in between.

752
00:56:34,136 --> 00:56:36,732  X1:156 X2:563 Y1:488 Y2:523
It's all waiting out there, Jackie.

753
00:56:36,777 --> 00:56:40,812  X1:162 X2:557 Y1:452 Y2:523
Everything's brand-new to me,
all those planets,

754
00:56:40,858 --> 00:56:42,803  X1:208 X2:511 Y1:488 Y2:523
creatures and horizons.

755
00:56:42,848 --> 00:56:46,133  X1:202 X2:517 Y1:452 Y2:523
I haven't seen them yet,
not with these eyes.

756
00:56:47,596 --> 00:56:49,120  X1:226 X2:493 Y1:488 Y2:523
And it is gonna be...

757
00:56:51,238 --> 00:56:52,921  X1:284 X2:435 Y1:488 Y2:523
.fantastic!

758
00:56:56,237 --> 00:56:59,061  X1:196 X2:523 Y1:452 Y2:523
That hand of yours
still gives me the creeps.

759
00:57:07,866 --> 00:57:10,583  X1:148 X2:571 Y1:488 Y2:523
So, where are we gonna go first?

760
00:57:10,626 --> 00:57:12,423  X1:314 X2:405 Y1:488 Y2:523
Um...

761
00:57:13,455 --> 00:57:16,602  X1:198 X2:521 Y1:488 Y2:523
.that way. No, hold on.

762
00:57:17,655 --> 00:57:19,810  X1:222 X2:497 Y1:488 Y2:523
That way. That way?

763
00:57:19,857 --> 00:57:21,681  X1:274 X2:443 Y1:488 Y2:523
D'you think?

764
00:57:21,726 --> 00:57:23,982  X1:254 X2:463 Y1:488 Y2:523
Yeah, that way.

765
00:57:34,235 --> 00:57:36,771  X1:168 X2:551 Y1:452 Y2:523
Where are we going?
Further than we've ever gone.

766
00:57:40,546 --> 00:57:42,861  X1:192 X2:527 Y1:452 Y2:523
I don't believe we've met.
I'm the Doctor.

767
00:57:42,907 --> 00:57:45,281  X1:208 X2:511 Y1:452 Y2:523
May I introduce
Miss Sarah Jane Smith?

768
00:57:50,015 --> 00:57:51,823  X1:330 X2:389 Y1:488 Y2:523
K9!

769
00:57:55,218 --> 00:57:58,282  X1:156 X2:563 Y1:452 Y2:523
He said he'll talk to a wanderer,
to the man without a home.

770
00:57:59,005 --> 00:58:02,481  X1:164 X2:553 Y1:452 Y2:523
Might I introduce Her Majesty,
Queen Victoria.

771
00:58:02,528 --> 00:58:04,362  X1:224 X2:493 Y1:488 Y2:523
Give her back to me.

772
00:58:06,797 --> 00:58:08,722  X1:228 X2:491 Y1:488 Y2:523
Bullets can't stop it.

773
00:58:21,508 --> 00:58:29,602  X1:160 X2:557 Y1:452 Y2:523
