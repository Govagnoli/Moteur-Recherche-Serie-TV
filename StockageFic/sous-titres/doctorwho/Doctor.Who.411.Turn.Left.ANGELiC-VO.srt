1
00:00:27,888 --> 00:00:30,397
You're gonna love this.
One, two, three.

2
00:00:33,532 --> 00:00:34,420
It's lovely!

3
00:00:38,728 --> 00:00:40,261
You want to buy Shukina?

4
00:00:43,539 --> 00:00:46,679
<i>Or Peshwami? Most beautiful
Peshwami in all of Shan Shen.</i>

5
00:00:46,779 --> 00:00:48,220
Er, no, thanks.

6
00:00:57,671 --> 00:00:59,323
Tell your fortune, lady?

7
00:00:59,423 --> 00:01:00,918
The future predicted.

8
00:01:01,018 --> 00:01:04,071
- Your life foretold.
- Oh, no, thanks.

9
00:01:04,543 --> 00:01:07,827
Don't you want to know
if you're going to be happy?

10
00:01:09,028 --> 00:01:10,855
I'm happy right now, thanks.

11
00:01:11,143 --> 00:01:12,376
You've got red hair.

12
00:01:12,476 --> 00:01:14,673
The reading's free for red hair.

13
00:01:16,069 --> 00:01:17,001
All right, then.

14
00:01:29,251 --> 00:01:31,309
Oh, you're fascinating!

15
00:01:31,635 --> 00:01:33,542
No, but you're good.

16
00:01:34,246 --> 00:01:37,011
I can see... a man.

17
00:01:37,662 --> 00:01:40,150
The most remarkable man.

18
00:01:40,602 --> 00:01:41,899
How did you meet him?

19
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:43,519
You're supposed to tell me.

20
00:01:43,951 --> 00:01:45,359
I see the future.

21
00:01:45,978 --> 00:01:47,273
Tell me the past.

22
00:01:47,648 --> 00:01:49,513
When did your lives cross?

23
00:01:50,921 --> 00:01:52,510
It's sort of complicated.

24
00:01:52,872 --> 00:01:55,180
I ended up in his spaceship
on my wedding day.

25
00:01:55,606 --> 00:01:58,540
- Long story.
- But what led you to that meeting?

26
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:00,769
All sorts of things,

27
00:02:02,302 --> 00:02:04,404
but my job, I suppose.

28
00:02:04,730 --> 00:02:07,852
It was on Earth,
this planet called Earth. Miles away.

29
00:02:08,189 --> 00:02:10,276
But I had this job, as a temp,

30
00:02:10,825 --> 00:02:13,350
I was a secretary,
in a place called HC Clements.

31
00:02:14,485 --> 00:02:16,470
<i>HC Clements, can I help you?</i>

32
00:02:22,095 --> 00:02:23,038
Sorry.

33
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:25,084
It's the incense.

34
00:02:25,409 --> 00:02:27,768
Just breathe deep.

35
00:02:29,513 --> 00:02:33,179
This job of yours.
What choices led you there?

36
00:02:34,831 --> 00:02:37,621
There was a choice.
Six months before.

37
00:02:38,635 --> 00:02:41,510
Cos the agency offered me
this contract with HC Clements.

38
00:02:42,589 --> 00:02:45,022
<i>There was this other job,
my mum knew this man...</i>

39
00:02:45,122 --> 00:02:49,052
Jival, he's called, Jival Chowdry.

40
00:02:50,316 --> 00:02:54,746
He runs that little photocopy
business and he needs a secretary.

41
00:02:54,846 --> 00:02:56,473
I've got a job!

42
00:02:56,573 --> 00:02:58,681
As a temp! This is permanent!

43
00:02:58,869 --> 00:03:00,722
It's 20,000 a year, Donna.

44
00:03:01,423 --> 00:03:03,626
HC Clements is in the City,

45
00:03:04,164 --> 00:03:07,630
it's nice, it's posh, so stop it!

46
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,360
Your life could have
gone one way or the other.

47
00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:18,070
- What made you decide?
- I just did.

48
00:03:18,521 --> 00:03:20,037
But when was the moment?

49
00:03:20,481 --> 00:03:21,989
When did you choose?

50
00:03:24,679 --> 00:03:27,038
It won't take long, just turn right,

51
00:03:27,138 --> 00:03:30,785
we'll pop in and see Mr Chowdry,
so Suzette can introduce you.

52
00:03:30,885 --> 00:03:33,334
I'm going left,
if you don't like it, get out and walk!

53
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:37,626
If you turn right, you'll have a career.
Not just filling-in.

54
00:03:37,882 --> 00:03:39,258
You think I'm so useless.

55
00:03:39,358 --> 00:03:42,687
Oh, I know why you want
a job with HC Clements, lady.

56
00:03:42,787 --> 00:03:44,408
Cos you think you'll meet a man

57
00:03:44,508 --> 00:03:47,267
with lots of money and your
whole life will change.

58
00:03:47,367 --> 00:03:48,806
Well, let me tell you, sweetheart,

59
00:03:48,906 --> 00:03:52,792
City executives don't need temps.
Except for practice.

60
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,950
Yeah, well, they haven't met me!

61
00:03:59,443 --> 00:04:00,650
You turned left.

62
00:04:02,452 --> 00:04:05,167
<i>What if you'd turned right?
What then?</i>

63
00:04:06,231 --> 00:04:08,490
- Let go of my hands.
- What if it changes?

64
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:12,553
What if you go right?
What if you could still go right?

65
00:04:17,808 --> 00:04:18,678
Stop it!

66
00:04:21,614 --> 00:04:22,496
What's that?!

67
00:04:23,478 --> 00:04:24,392
What's on my back?

68
00:04:25,349 --> 00:04:26,250
What is it?

69
00:04:26,988 --> 00:04:27,852
What's on my back?

70
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:30,512
<i>Make the choice again, Donna Noble,</i>

71
00:04:30,612 --> 00:04:34,190
and change your mind. Turn right!

72
00:04:38,737 --> 00:04:40,030
I'm turning.

73
00:04:41,565 --> 00:04:43,348
Turn right.

74
00:04:44,405 --> 00:04:45,990
<i>Turn right!</i>

75
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:47,815
Turn RIGHT!

76
00:04:49,203 --> 00:04:53,258
Let me tell you, sweetheart,
City executives don't need temps.

77
00:04:53,358 --> 00:04:55,110
Except for practice.

78
00:04:55,654 --> 00:04:56,744
Yeah.

79
00:04:57,212 --> 00:04:58,526
Suppose you're right.

80
00:04:58,626 --> 00:05:02,493
<i>Turn right, and never meet that man.</i>

81
00:05:02,831 --> 00:05:06,529
<i>Turn right and change the world!</i>

82
00:05:30,734 --> 00:05:34,030

# We wish you a merry Christmas
We wish you a merry Christmas #

87
00:05:49,196 --> 00:05:53,015
# We wish you a merry Christmas
and a happy New Year... #

88
00:05:53,115 --> 00:05:54,468
Get out of the way!

89
00:05:57,372 --> 00:05:59,975
Here we are! Feed at the trough!

90
00:06:00,075 --> 00:06:01,673
Mooky says, let's go to the Boardwalk,

91
00:06:01,773 --> 00:06:04,348
- it's 2 for the price of 1.
- Christmas Eve? It'll be heaving!

92
00:06:04,448 --> 00:06:07,020
Well, exactly! Get in and grab 'em!

93
00:06:07,631 --> 00:06:10,695
That's the second round of drinks
you've bought, it was my turn.

94
00:06:11,004 --> 00:06:13,100
I can afford it. Promotion!

95
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:18,855
You are talking to Jival Chowdry's
Personal Assistant, I'll have you know.

96
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:23,292
Capital P, capital A,
£23,000 per annum, merci beaucoup!

97
00:06:23,392 --> 00:06:26,461
- Here's to Mr Chowdry!
- Mr Chowdry!

98
00:06:26,933 --> 00:06:28,406
<i>She gets all the luck.</i>

99
00:06:29,443 --> 00:06:32,003
What's wrong? What is it?

100
00:06:32,826 --> 00:06:33,405
Sorry?

101
00:06:33,505 --> 00:06:34,792
Someone spill a drink on me?

102
00:06:34,892 --> 00:06:35,407
No.

103
00:06:36,208 --> 00:06:39,307
Why d'you keep looking
at my shoulder, what's wrong?

104
00:06:39,543 --> 00:06:40,208
I don't know.

105
00:06:40,308 --> 00:06:42,418
Oh, don't tell me you're
getting all spooky again.

106
00:06:42,518 --> 00:06:45,880
It was bad enough when you saw the ghost
of Earl Mountbatten at the Boat Show.

107
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:47,331
What're you looking at?

108
00:06:47,431 --> 00:06:49,321
- What is it?
- It's like...

109
00:06:50,579 --> 00:06:52,731
It's like there's something I can't see.

110
00:06:53,162 --> 00:06:55,260
<i>No, shut up all of you!</i>

111
00:06:55,437 --> 00:06:57,711
<i>Come and see.
Just look at the sky!</i>

112
00:06:57,889 --> 00:07:00,354
It's a star! It's a Christmas star!

113
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:01,562
Come on, then.

114
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:10,722
What the hell is that?!
Ken Livingston, that's what!

115
00:07:10,822 --> 00:07:13,769
- Spending our money on decorations!
- How much did that cost?!

116
00:07:13,869 --> 00:07:16,960
Don't be so stupid,
it's flying, it's really flying!

117
00:07:21,849 --> 00:07:23,379
That's not a star,

118
00:07:23,573 --> 00:07:24,888
<i>that's a web.</i>

119
00:07:25,882 --> 00:07:28,571
It's heading east,
the middle of the city.

120
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:49,941
Alice, there's a great big
web star thing shooting at people

121
00:07:50,041 --> 00:07:51,520
and you're looking at ME!

122
00:07:52,587 --> 00:07:55,190
There's something on your back!

123
00:08:00,101 --> 00:08:02,146
Donna! Where you going?!

124
00:08:02,497 --> 00:08:05,665
You'll get yourself killed! Donna!!

125
00:08:10,372 --> 00:08:11,423
Fire!

126
00:08:18,004 --> 00:08:21,065
<i>Everyone stay back!
The Thames has been closed.</i>

127
00:08:21,823 --> 00:08:23,110
<i>Return to your homes.</i>

128
00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:25,935
<i>Keep away from the river,
and that's an order.</i>

129
00:08:28,193 --> 00:08:31,804
<i>Trap 1 to Greyhound 15,
what is your report? Over.</i>

130
00:08:32,055 --> 00:08:34,551
From the evidence I'd say
he managed to stop a creature,

131
00:08:34,772 --> 00:08:36,224
some sort of red spider.

132
00:08:36,648 --> 00:08:39,553
<i>Blew up the base underneath the barrier,
flooded the whole thing. Over.</i>

133
00:08:39,653 --> 00:08:41,920
<i>And where is he now? Over.</i>

134
00:08:43,199 --> 00:08:45,732
We've found a body, sir. Over.

135
00:08:46,274 --> 00:08:48,807
- Is it him? Over.
- I think so.

136
00:08:49,117 --> 00:08:50,788
<i>Just didn't make it out in time.</i>

137
00:08:56,037 --> 00:08:57,246
The Doctor is dead.

138
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:00,135
<i>It must have happened
too fast for him to regenerate.</i>

139
00:09:06,715 --> 00:09:08,489
<i>Escort the ambulance back to unit base.</i>

140
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:23,270
What happened, what did they find?
Did they find someone?

141
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:26,855
I don't know.
Bloke called the Doctor or something.

142
00:09:26,955 --> 00:09:28,020
Where is he?

143
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:30,158
They took him away. He's dead.

144
00:09:33,198 --> 00:09:34,794
I'm sorry. Did you know him?

145
00:09:35,924 --> 00:09:38,706
I mean, they didn't say his name.

146
00:09:39,364 --> 00:09:40,773
It could be any doctor.

147
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:43,920
I came so far.

148
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:47,821
It could be anyone.

149
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:53,271
- What's your name?
- Donna.

150
00:09:53,914 --> 00:09:56,404
- And you?
- Oh, I was just...

151
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:59,400
passing by, I shouldn't even be here.

152
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:02,911
This is wrong. This is wrong.
This is so wrong.

153
00:10:05,290 --> 00:10:08,623
- Sorry, what was it, Donna what?
- Why d'you keep looking at my back?

154
00:10:08,723 --> 00:10:09,924
- I'm not.
- Yes, you are.

155
00:10:10,024 --> 00:10:12,180
You keep looking behind me,
you're doing it now.

156
00:10:12,542 --> 00:10:15,395
What is it, what's there?
Has someone put something on my back?

157
00:10:26,779 --> 00:10:30,830
You can't sack me!
I'm your Personal Assistant!

158
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:34,809
You don't have to make a scene,
just come downstairs, and we can talk.

159
00:10:34,909 --> 00:10:37,081
Oh, I'll make a scene,
right in front of a tribunal.

160
00:10:37,181 --> 00:10:39,256
And the first thing I'll say is
"wandering hands"!

161
00:10:39,450 --> 00:10:41,612
You know what it's been like
for the past few months,

162
00:10:41,712 --> 00:10:43,006
ever since that Christmas thing.

163
00:10:43,106 --> 00:10:45,323
Half my contracts were on
the other side of the river,

164
00:10:45,423 --> 00:10:46,997
and the Thames is still closed off.

165
00:10:47,097 --> 00:10:49,328
Look, I can't deliver,
I'm losing a fortune.

166
00:10:49,428 --> 00:10:50,743
Well, sack one of this lot!

167
00:10:50,843 --> 00:10:53,861
Sack Cliff! He just sits there,
I don't know what he does all day.

168
00:10:53,961 --> 00:10:54,748
Sorry, Cliff.

169
00:10:54,848 --> 00:10:57,670
Actually, I'm not sorry,
what DO you do all day?

170
00:10:58,810 --> 00:10:59,840
What the hell?!

171
00:11:05,911 --> 00:11:07,162
Like an earthquake.

172
00:11:08,149 --> 00:11:09,186
That's weird.

173
00:11:09,845 --> 00:11:11,469
Funny sort of clouds...

174
00:11:12,591 --> 00:11:13,600
Who typed this?

175
00:11:13,907 --> 00:11:17,912
I'm your PA, did you get
someone else to type this?

176
00:11:20,429 --> 00:11:21,590
Beatrice!

177
00:11:23,016 --> 00:11:26,592
It sounds impossible,
but the entire hospital has vanished.

178
00:11:26,692 --> 00:11:28,702
<i>The Royal Hope no longer exists.</i>

179
00:11:28,850 --> 00:11:31,076
<i>It's not been destroyed,
there's no wreckage,</i>

180
00:11:31,176 --> 00:11:32,425
<i>it's simply gone.</i>

181
00:11:32,618 --> 00:11:37,274
Reports from bystanders say that
the rain lifted up around the hospital.

182
00:11:37,588 --> 00:11:40,735
Hole punch, having that.
Stapler, mine.

183
00:11:40,835 --> 00:11:43,784
Toy cactus,
you can have that, Beatrice, catch!

184
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:47,151
Cliff, I'd leave you my mousemat,
but I'm worried you'd cut yourself.

185
00:11:47,251 --> 00:11:48,732
All right, Donna, have some respect.

186
00:11:48,832 --> 00:11:51,415
There's 2,000 people in that hospital.
And it's vanished!

187
00:11:51,515 --> 00:11:54,430
I'll show you vanishing.
Thanks for nothing!

188
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:57,716
Oh, and you know when that
money went missing from the kitty?

189
00:11:58,073 --> 00:12:00,303
Anne Marie. That's all I'm saying.

190
00:12:00,539 --> 00:12:02,184
Anne Marie!

191
00:12:04,601 --> 00:12:06,832
Oh, don't tell me,
the hospital's back!

192
00:12:07,275 --> 00:12:09,185
Well, isn't that wizard?!

193
00:12:10,308 --> 00:12:14,463
To confirm. The Royal Hope Hospital
was returned to its original position.

194
00:12:14,563 --> 00:12:16,131
But with only one survivor.

195
00:12:16,796 --> 00:12:20,173
The only person left alive,
is medical student Oliver Morgenstern.

196
00:12:20,273 --> 00:12:22,239
And there were these creatures.

197
00:12:22,711 --> 00:12:25,855
Like rhinos.
Talking rhinos in black leather...

198
00:12:25,955 --> 00:12:26,935
Rhinos?

199
00:12:27,035 --> 00:12:29,038
Rhinos, could be aliens.

200
00:12:29,939 --> 00:12:32,907
<i>We couldn't breathe,
we were running out of air.</i>

201
00:12:33,007 --> 00:12:37,052
A colleague of mine gave
me the last oxygen tank. Martha.

202
00:12:37,395 --> 00:12:38,719
Martha Jones.

203
00:12:39,691 --> 00:12:41,243
And she died.

204
00:12:42,116 --> 00:12:44,310
Least you've got a hole punch.

205
00:12:44,839 --> 00:12:46,098
And a raffle ticket.

206
00:12:46,198 --> 00:12:49,666
Yeah, well, they can keep the raffle,
I wouldn't take a penny off that man.

207
00:12:49,766 --> 00:12:52,298
Honestly, you two!
There's aliens on the news!

208
00:12:52,398 --> 00:12:54,453
They took that hospital
all the way to the moon,

209
00:12:54,553 --> 00:12:56,348
and you're banging on
about raffle tickets!

210
00:12:56,448 --> 00:12:59,851
Don't be daft, Gramps,
it wasn't the moon, it couldn't be.

211
00:12:59,951 --> 00:13:02,940
I am telling you, it is getting worse,
these past few years.

212
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,535
It's like all of a sudden,

213
00:13:04,635 --> 00:13:07,898
they suddenly know all about us
and there's keen eyes up there

214
00:13:07,998 --> 00:13:10,072
and they're watching us,
and they're not friendly.

215
00:13:10,172 --> 00:13:11,725
This stapler says Bea.

216
00:13:11,825 --> 00:13:14,077
Can't believe how well you're taking
me getting sacked.

217
00:13:14,177 --> 00:13:15,321
Thought you'd hit the roof.

218
00:13:15,421 --> 00:13:16,472
I'm just tired, Donna.

219
00:13:16,572 --> 00:13:18,239
What with your father and everything.

220
00:13:19,083 --> 00:13:21,430
To be honest, I've given up on you.

221
00:13:21,530 --> 00:13:23,681
<i>This further report just in
from Oliver Morgenstern.</i>

222
00:13:23,781 --> 00:13:25,375
There was this woman
who took control.

223
00:13:25,475 --> 00:13:29,294
Said she knew what to do, said she
could stop the MRI or something.

224
00:13:29,394 --> 00:13:32,521
Sarah Jane, her name was.
Sarah Jane Smith.

225
00:13:32,693 --> 00:13:35,720
Sarah Jane Smith was
a freelance investigative journalist,

226
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:38,151
<i>formerly of Metropolitan Magazine.</i>

227
00:13:38,251 --> 00:13:41,670
<i>Her body was recovered from
the hospital late this afternoon...</i>

228
00:13:42,185 --> 00:13:44,790
- What's for tea?
- I've got nothing in.

229
00:13:45,710 --> 00:13:46,712
I'll get chips.

230
00:13:47,198 --> 00:13:50,250
Last of my wages.
Fish and chips, yeah?

231
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:54,140
<i>Along with his teenage friends
Maria Jackson and Clyde Langer.</i>

232
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,693
<i>It is feared that they also perished.</i>

233
00:14:25,257 --> 00:14:27,231
Blimey, you all right?!

234
00:14:28,625 --> 00:14:31,542
- What was that, fireworks, or...?
- I dunno. I was just...

235
00:14:31,914 --> 00:14:33,537
walking along. That's weird!

236
00:14:35,968 --> 00:14:37,055
You're the one...

237
00:14:38,114 --> 00:14:39,950
Christmas Eve, I met you, in town.

238
00:14:40,555 --> 00:14:42,964
- Donna, isn't it?
- What was your name?

239
00:14:43,315 --> 00:14:44,895
How're you doing?
You're looking good.

240
00:14:45,081 --> 00:14:46,490
What you been up to?

241
00:14:46,962 --> 00:14:49,074
- You're doing it again.
- What?

242
00:14:49,553 --> 00:14:50,910
Looking behind me.

243
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:52,860
People keep on doing that.

244
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:55,488
- Looking at my back.
- What sort of people?

245
00:14:56,303 --> 00:14:57,450
People in the street.

246
00:14:57,755 --> 00:14:58,680
Strangers.

247
00:14:59,170 --> 00:15:00,682
I just catch them, sometimes.

248
00:15:00,782 --> 00:15:02,034
Staring at me.

249
00:15:02,956 --> 00:15:04,551
Like they're looking at something.

250
00:15:04,751 --> 00:15:08,049
And then I get home and
I look and there's nothing there.

251
00:15:10,781 --> 00:15:13,556
- See? Look, now I'M doing it!
- What are you doing for Christmas?

252
00:15:13,878 --> 00:15:15,086
What am I what?!

253
00:15:15,186 --> 00:15:17,396
Next Christmas. Any plans?

254
00:15:17,739 --> 00:15:19,284
I dunno, that's ages away!

255
00:15:19,384 --> 00:15:21,672
Nothing much, I suppose. Why?

256
00:15:22,509 --> 00:15:24,350
Just, I think you should get out,

257
00:15:24,619 --> 00:15:27,550
you and your family. Don't stay
in London. Just leave the city.

258
00:15:28,623 --> 00:15:29,546
What for?

259
00:15:29,646 --> 00:15:31,991
Nice hotel. Christmas break?

260
00:15:32,792 --> 00:15:33,622
Can't afford it.

261
00:15:33,722 --> 00:15:35,605
Well, now,
you've got that raffle ticket.

262
00:15:36,763 --> 00:15:38,837
- How d'you know about that?
- First prize.

263
00:15:39,888 --> 00:15:41,268
Luxury weekend break.

264
00:15:41,469 --> 00:15:43,430
Use it, Donna Noble.

265
00:15:44,130 --> 00:15:46,430
Why won't you tell me your name?

266
00:15:50,881 --> 00:15:52,841
I think you

267
00:15:53,491 --> 00:15:54,907
should leave me alone.

268
00:16:05,765 --> 00:16:09,541
# Merry Xmas Everybody #
by Slade

269
00:16:11,343 --> 00:16:14,190
<i>Cor blimey! That's what I call posh!</i>

270
00:16:14,450 --> 00:16:17,615
I said you were lucky!
Didn't I always say, my lucky star?

271
00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:22,221
For God's sake, don't tell them
that we won it in a raffle. Be classy!

272
00:16:22,321 --> 00:16:25,124
- Dad, take those things off.
- No, I shan't, it's Christmas!

273
00:16:25,224 --> 00:16:27,827
I'll have that one, thank you,
it's got my liniment in it.

274
00:16:27,927 --> 00:16:29,629
I reckon we deserve this.

275
00:16:30,459 --> 00:16:31,868
It's been a hell of a year.

276
00:16:31,968 --> 00:16:33,899
Your Dad would've loved this.

277
00:16:34,717 --> 00:16:35,381
Yeah.

278
00:16:36,457 --> 00:16:37,523
He would've.

279
00:16:45,947 --> 00:16:48,950
<i>Oy! Gramps!
Get that, that'll be breakfast!</i>

280
00:16:49,210 --> 00:16:50,630
We've got croissants!

281
00:16:50,991 --> 00:16:52,870
Why can't you get it? Lady Muck!

282
00:16:53,130 --> 00:16:55,432
It's Christmas Day,
I never get up before ten.

283
00:16:55,868 --> 00:16:58,415
Only madam there
was up with the dawn chorus.

284
00:16:58,515 --> 00:17:00,375
<i>Like when she was six years old!</i>

285
00:17:00,475 --> 00:17:02,785
I'm not wasting a second in this place!

286
00:17:03,528 --> 00:17:06,830
- How was the sofa?
- Oh, yeah, not so good, really.

287
00:17:10,066 --> 00:17:12,426
You know we could've paid
for a second room.

288
00:17:13,318 --> 00:17:14,037
Oi!

289
00:17:15,192 --> 00:17:17,595
- Merry Christmas!
- Merry Christmas.

290
00:17:17,695 --> 00:17:19,189
Merry Christmas, Dad.

291
00:17:19,449 --> 00:17:23,716
All right! All right, my darlin'!
Grub's up! Merry Christmas!

292
00:17:23,816 --> 00:17:24,833
Merry Christmas, sir.

293
00:17:26,242 --> 00:17:27,236
Have you seen this?

294
00:17:27,336 --> 00:17:29,310
Nice early breakfast,
then we'll go for a walk.

295
00:17:29,570 --> 00:17:31,134
People always say that at Christmas,

296
00:17:31,234 --> 00:17:33,708
"Oh, we all went for a walk"
I've always wanted to do that.

297
00:17:33,808 --> 00:17:36,850
So, walk first, presents later, yeah?

298
00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:37,944
Donna, come and see.

299
00:17:38,044 --> 00:17:39,890
Tienes algo en tu espalda.

300
00:17:40,169 --> 00:17:41,349
- What?
- Look at the telly.

301
00:17:41,449 --> 00:17:42,907
Tienes algo en tu espalda.

302
00:17:43,007 --> 00:17:45,039
What does it mean?
Don't know what you're saying.

303
00:17:45,139 --> 00:17:48,328
- Donna, look at the TV!
- Tienes algo en tu espalda!

304
00:17:55,792 --> 00:17:58,538
For God's sake, Donna,
don't just stand there, come and look!

305
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:05,036
<i>This footage is live and genuine.
The object is falling on Central London.</i>

306
00:18:05,136 --> 00:18:08,433
I repeat, this is not a hoax.
A replica of the Titanic

307
00:18:08,533 --> 00:18:12,235
is falling out of the sky and
it's heading for Buckingham Palace.

308
00:18:12,664 --> 00:18:15,872
<i>We're getting this footage from
the Guinnevere range of satellites.</i>

309
00:18:16,195 --> 00:18:18,282
Is that... a film or something?

310
00:18:20,767 --> 00:18:23,377
<i>The Royal Air Force
has declared an emerg...</i>

311
00:18:33,801 --> 00:18:35,052
It's gone dead.

312
00:18:35,946 --> 00:18:36,712
All of them.

313
00:18:36,812 --> 00:18:39,825
No, but the Titanic?!
Oh, don't be daft!

314
00:18:41,283 --> 00:18:42,714
Is that like a sequel?

315
00:18:43,801 --> 00:18:44,470
Oh...

316
00:18:46,397 --> 00:18:48,337
Oh, God rest their souls.

317
00:18:54,323 --> 00:18:56,368
<i>I was supposed to be out there,
selling papers.</i>

318
00:18:56,468 --> 00:18:58,107
I should've been there.
We all should.

319
00:18:58,751 --> 00:18:59,880
We'd be dead.

320
00:19:00,792 --> 00:19:02,112
That's everyone.

321
00:19:02,927 --> 00:19:05,287
Every single person we know.

322
00:19:05,709 --> 00:19:06,939
The whole city.

323
00:19:08,355 --> 00:19:09,320
Can't be.

324
00:19:09,985 --> 00:19:11,465
But it is. It's gone.

325
00:19:12,588 --> 00:19:13,839
London's gone.

326
00:19:15,019 --> 00:19:17,110
If you hadn't won that raffle...

327
00:19:24,010 --> 00:19:27,061
Leeds?! I'm not moving to Leeds!

328
00:19:27,161 --> 00:19:28,491
I'm afraid it's Leeds,

329
00:19:28,591 --> 00:19:31,206
or you can wait in the hostel
for another three months.

330
00:19:31,306 --> 00:19:32,737
All I want is a washing machine.

331
00:19:32,837 --> 00:19:35,310
What about Glasgow,
I heard there was jobs going in Glasgow.

332
00:19:35,410 --> 00:19:36,527
You can't pick and choose!

333
00:19:36,627 --> 00:19:39,323
All of Southern England's
flooded with radiation,

334
00:19:39,423 --> 00:19:42,060
7 million people in need of relocation,

335
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:46,828
and now France has closed its borders,
so it's Leeds or nothing. Next!

336
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:02,644
<i>The Daniels Family,
billetted at number 15.</i>

337
00:20:02,744 --> 00:20:05,883
Mr & Mrs Obego, billetted at number 31.

338
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:08,565
<i>Miss Coltrane, you're in number 8.</i>

339
00:20:08,665 --> 00:20:11,070
The Noble family,
billetted at number 29...

340
00:20:11,170 --> 00:20:13,110
That's us! Come on. Off we go.

341
00:20:14,324 --> 00:20:15,060
All right?

342
00:20:17,170 --> 00:20:19,746
Used to be a nice little family,
number 29.

343
00:20:19,846 --> 00:20:22,078
They missed one mortgage
payment, just one,

344
00:20:22,178 --> 00:20:24,559
they got booted out, all for you lot.

345
00:20:24,659 --> 00:20:27,320
Don't get all chippy
with me, Vera Duckworth.

346
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:30,108
Pop your clogs on and go
and feed t'whippets.

347
00:20:30,208 --> 00:20:31,173
Sweetheart, come on.

348
00:20:31,273 --> 00:20:34,405
You're not gonna make the
world any better by shouting at it.

349
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:36,408
I can try.

350
00:20:42,714 --> 00:20:44,552
What happens, do we get keys?

351
00:20:44,652 --> 00:20:47,427
- I don't know, do I?
- Who do we ask, the soldiers?

352
00:20:48,486 --> 00:20:51,144
Hey-ey! Is a big house!

353
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:54,620
Room for all! Welcome! In you come.

354
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:58,732
- I thought this was OUR house.
- Is many people's house! Is wonderful!

355
00:20:58,832 --> 00:21:00,060
In! In! In!

356
00:21:01,211 --> 00:21:03,135
<i>We've been here
for eight weeks already.</i>

357
00:21:03,235 --> 00:21:06,839
<i>I had a nice little paper shop
in Shepherd's Bush. All gone now.</i>

358
00:21:06,939 --> 00:21:10,657
So, upstairs, we have the
Merchandani family, seven of them,

359
00:21:10,757 --> 00:21:12,569
good family, good kids.

360
00:21:13,034 --> 00:21:15,701
Except that one, be careful of him.

361
00:21:16,359 --> 00:21:20,722
That's a joking! Where's that smile?

362
00:21:21,379 --> 00:21:24,612
Rocco Colosanto,
I'm here with my wife, and her sister,

363
00:21:24,712 --> 00:21:26,851
her husband, their kids,
and their daughter's kids.

364
00:21:26,951 --> 00:21:28,053
We've got the front room.

365
00:21:28,153 --> 00:21:31,815
My mother, she's got the back room.
She's old, you forgive.

366
00:21:32,208 --> 00:21:37,440
And this, this is you,
this is your palace!

367
00:21:40,426 --> 00:21:42,790
- What d'you mean, this is us?
- You live here!

368
00:21:43,729 --> 00:21:45,795
- We living in the kitchen?!
- You got camp beds!

369
00:21:45,895 --> 00:21:48,735
You got the cooker, you keep warm,
you got the fridge, you keep cool!

370
00:21:48,835 --> 00:21:50,631
- Is good!
- What about the bathroom?

371
00:21:50,731 --> 00:21:54,135
- Nobody lives in the bathroom!
- No, I mean, is there a rota?

372
00:21:54,235 --> 00:21:56,781
Is pot luck! Is fun!

373
00:21:57,003 --> 00:21:59,877
I go wake Mamma,
she likes new people.

374
00:21:59,977 --> 00:22:03,070
Mamma! Is people! Nice people!

375
00:22:05,542 --> 00:22:06,566
Ah, well...

376
00:22:07,510 --> 00:22:09,777
We'll settle in, won't we? Make do.

377
00:22:10,242 --> 00:22:12,209
Bit of wartime spirit, eh?

378
00:22:12,538 --> 00:22:15,338
But there isn't a war.
There's no fight,

379
00:22:16,289 --> 00:22:17,369
There's just...

380
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:19,094
this.

381
00:22:19,657 --> 00:22:21,198
Well, America, they'll save us.

382
00:22:21,298 --> 00:22:22,389
It was on the news.

383
00:22:22,489 --> 00:22:27,074
They're gonna send Great Britain
50 billion quid in financial aid!

384
00:22:27,515 --> 00:22:28,884
God bless America!

385
00:22:28,984 --> 00:22:33,340
America is in crisis with
over 60 million reported dead.

386
00:22:33,850 --> 00:22:38,426
Sixty million people have dissolved
into fat. And the fat is walking.

387
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:42,043
<i>People's fat has come to life
and is walking through the streets.</i>

388
00:22:42,579 --> 00:22:44,395
<i>And there are spaceships.</i>

389
00:22:44,495 --> 00:22:48,330
<i>There are reports of spaceships
over every major US city.</i>

390
00:22:48,430 --> 00:22:49,889
<i>The fat is flying...</i>

391
00:22:49,989 --> 00:22:50,990
Aliens.

392
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:52,998
Yeah.

393
00:22:53,164 --> 00:22:54,280
<i>...into the air.</i>

394
00:22:56,233 --> 00:22:59,579
Mary McGinty, d'you remember her?

395
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:01,296
Who was she?

396
00:23:01,710 --> 00:23:04,321
Worked in the newsagent on a Sunday.

397
00:23:05,277 --> 00:23:07,151
Little woman, black hair.

398
00:23:08,266 --> 00:23:09,754
Never really spoke to her.

399
00:23:10,297 --> 00:23:11,291
She'll be dead.

400
00:23:12,078 --> 00:23:13,959
<i>Every day, I think of someone else.</i>

401
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:15,543
<i>All dead.</i>

402
00:23:15,994 --> 00:23:17,860
Maybe she went away for Christmas.

403
00:23:18,346 --> 00:23:19,205
Maybe.

404
00:23:21,207 --> 00:23:24,425
I'll go out tomorrow,
I'll walk into town.

405
00:23:24,969 --> 00:23:26,237
There's got to be work.

406
00:23:26,515 --> 00:23:28,389
Everyone needs secretaries.

407
00:23:28,782 --> 00:23:31,670
Soon as I'm earning,
we'll get a proper place.

408
00:23:32,272 --> 00:23:33,502
Just you wait, Mum.

409
00:23:34,103 --> 00:23:35,630
What if it never gets better?

410
00:23:36,101 --> 00:23:37,310
Course it will.

411
00:23:37,653 --> 00:23:39,226
<i>Even the bees are disappearing.</i>

412
00:23:39,326 --> 00:23:41,314
You don't see bumble bees any more.

413
00:23:41,472 --> 00:23:42,730
They'll sort us out,

414
00:23:44,175 --> 00:23:45,464
the Emergency Government.

415
00:23:46,344 --> 00:23:48,375
- They'll do something.
- What if they don't?

416
00:23:49,898 --> 00:23:50,913
Then...

417
00:23:52,208 --> 00:23:53,409
we'll complain.

418
00:23:53,509 --> 00:23:54,870
Who's gonna listen to us?

419
00:23:55,421 --> 00:23:56,744
Refugees.

420
00:23:57,409 --> 00:23:58,940
We haven't even got a vote.

421
00:23:59,715 --> 00:24:01,335
We're just no-one, Donna.

422
00:24:02,115 --> 00:24:03,574
We don't exist.

423
00:24:04,189 --> 00:24:07,365
# ..And I spent all my
money on whisky and beer.. #

424
00:24:07,465 --> 00:24:10,490
I am going to kill that man!

425
00:24:13,172 --> 00:24:15,500
Now, listen, Mussolini!

426
00:24:16,515 --> 00:24:20,282
I am telling you, for the last time,
to button it!

427
00:24:20,618 --> 00:24:23,702
If I hear one more sea shanty...

428
00:24:26,930 --> 00:24:29,390
Always loved a sing-song.

429
00:24:29,838 --> 00:24:32,693
# ..I'm just a poor boy,
nobody loves me

430
00:24:32,793 --> 00:24:35,639
# He's just a poor boy
from a poor family

431
00:24:35,739 --> 00:24:38,629
# Spare him his life
from this monstrosity

432
00:24:40,073 --> 00:24:41,370
# Easy come, easy go

433
00:24:41,470 --> 00:24:43,600
# Will you let me go...? #

434
00:24:46,404 --> 00:24:48,285
You stay here!

435
00:24:49,128 --> 00:24:50,230
Everyone, stay!

436
00:24:53,007 --> 00:24:55,875
Hey! Firing at the car, is not so good!

437
00:24:55,975 --> 00:24:57,606
You crazy or what?!

438
00:24:57,770 --> 00:24:59,337
It's this ATMOS thing, it won't stop,

439
00:24:59,437 --> 00:25:00,545
it's like gas, it's toxic.

440
00:25:00,645 --> 00:25:01,694
Well, switch it off!

441
00:25:01,794 --> 00:25:04,047
I have done! It's still going!
It's all the cars,

442
00:25:04,147 --> 00:25:06,743
every single ATMOS car!
They've gone mad...

443
00:25:08,931 --> 00:25:10,590
You... lady, turn round.

444
00:25:10,971 --> 00:25:12,480
- Turn around!
- Are you crazy, boy?

445
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:12,980
Now!

446
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:15,262
- Put that down!
- Turn round!

447
00:25:16,330 --> 00:25:17,364
Do what he says!

448
00:25:17,490 --> 00:25:19,202
Show me your back! Turn around!

449
00:25:19,981 --> 00:25:21,304
<i>Show me your back!</i>

450
00:25:26,968 --> 00:25:27,564
Sorry.

451
00:25:27,944 --> 00:25:28,902
I thought I saw...

452
00:25:29,002 --> 00:25:33,059
Call yourself a soldier?!
Pointing guns at innocent women!

453
00:25:33,159 --> 00:25:34,340
<i>You're a disgrace!</i>

454
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:36,750
<i>In my day, we'd have
had you court-martialled!</i>

455
00:25:37,199 --> 00:25:40,889
Donna, where are you going?
It's not safe at night!

456
00:25:41,096 --> 00:25:43,110
Donna! Donna!

457
00:25:48,056 --> 00:25:48,685
Hello.

458
00:25:50,461 --> 00:25:51,143
Hi.

459
00:25:51,839 --> 00:25:53,491
It's the ATMOS devices.

460
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:57,374
We're lucky, it's not so bad here,
Britain hasn't got that much petrol.

461
00:25:57,474 --> 00:25:58,850
But all over Europe...

462
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:01,832
China, South Africa...

463
00:26:02,433 --> 00:26:04,300
They're getting choked by gas.

464
00:26:05,194 --> 00:26:06,552
Can't anyone stop it?

465
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:08,743
Yeah, they're trying right now.

466
00:26:08,843 --> 00:26:12,598
This little band of fighters,
on board the Sontaran ship.

467
00:26:14,114 --> 00:26:15,565
Any second now.

468
00:26:30,596 --> 00:26:31,876
And that was...?

469
00:26:32,658 --> 00:26:33,991
That was the Torchwood team.

470
00:26:34,748 --> 00:26:36,024
Gwen Cooper,

471
00:26:36,395 --> 00:26:38,408
Ianto Jones, they gave their lives.

472
00:26:39,329 --> 00:26:42,889
And Captain Jack Harkness has
transported to the Sontaran homeworld.

473
00:26:43,108 --> 00:26:44,280
There's no-one left.

474
00:26:47,312 --> 00:26:49,101
You're always wearing
the same clothes.

475
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:51,516
Why won't you tell me your name?

476
00:26:51,616 --> 00:26:54,194
None of this was meant to happen.

477
00:26:55,482 --> 00:26:56,515
There was a man.

478
00:26:57,735 --> 00:27:00,408
This wonderful man.
And he stopped it.

479
00:27:00,627 --> 00:27:04,788
The Titanic, the Adipose, the ATMOS,
he stopped them all from happening.

480
00:27:04,982 --> 00:27:06,550
That... Doctor?

481
00:27:07,265 --> 00:27:09,112
- You knew him.
- Did I?

482
00:27:10,518 --> 00:27:11,064
When?

483
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:14,687
I think you dream about him sometimes.
It's a man in a suit.

484
00:27:14,931 --> 00:27:17,784
Tall, thin man. Great hair.

485
00:27:18,441 --> 00:27:20,875
Some really great hair.

486
00:27:22,007 --> 00:27:23,233
Who are you?

487
00:27:23,609 --> 00:27:26,024
I was like you. I used to be you.

488
00:27:26,175 --> 00:27:27,870
Cos you travelled with him, Donna,

489
00:27:28,032 --> 00:27:30,136
you travelled with the Doctor
in a different world.

490
00:27:30,236 --> 00:27:32,426
I never met him. And he's dead.

491
00:27:32,526 --> 00:27:34,054
He died underneath the Thames

492
00:27:34,154 --> 00:27:36,162
on Christmas Eve.
But you were meant to be there.

493
00:27:36,262 --> 00:27:39,215
He needed someone to stop him,
and that was you. You made him leave.

494
00:27:39,772 --> 00:27:41,011
You saved his life.

495
00:27:49,095 --> 00:27:51,810
Doctor! You can stop now!

496
00:27:53,050 --> 00:27:55,695
Stop it! I don't know what you're
talking about, leave me alone!

497
00:27:55,795 --> 00:27:58,426
Something's coming, Donna.
Something worse.

498
00:27:58,715 --> 00:28:01,227
The whole world is stinking.

499
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:04,005
How could anything be worse than this?

500
00:28:04,105 --> 00:28:06,870
Trust me. We need the Doctor
more than ever. I've...

501
00:28:07,792 --> 00:28:10,233
I've been pulled across
from a different universe,

502
00:28:10,333 --> 00:28:12,315
because every single
universe is in danger.

503
00:28:12,647 --> 00:28:14,190
It's coming, Donna.

504
00:28:14,450 --> 00:28:17,893
<i>It's coming from across the stars,
and nothing can stop it.</i>

505
00:28:17,993 --> 00:28:19,070
What is?

506
00:28:20,096 --> 00:28:21,203
The darkness.

507
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:27,735
Well, what d'you keep telling me for?
What am I supposed to do?!

508
00:28:28,154 --> 00:28:29,280
I'm nothing special.

509
00:28:29,524 --> 00:28:33,689
I mean... I'm not...
I'm nothing special. I'm a temp!

510
00:28:34,087 --> 00:28:36,350
I'm not even that! I'm nothing.

511
00:28:36,502 --> 00:28:40,590
Donna Noble, you're the most important
woman in the whole of creation.

512
00:28:42,114 --> 00:28:43,215
Oh, don't.

513
00:28:44,208 --> 00:28:46,427
Just... don't.

514
00:28:48,454 --> 00:28:49,590
I'm tired.

515
00:28:51,117 --> 00:28:53,601
I'm so tired.

516
00:28:55,488 --> 00:28:57,140
I need you to come with me.

517
00:28:57,984 --> 00:28:59,780
Yeah, well,

518
00:29:00,812 --> 00:29:03,792
blonde hair might work on the men,
but you ain't shifting me, lady!

519
00:29:03,892 --> 00:29:05,144
That's more like it.

520
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:08,566
- I've got plenty more.
- You'll come with me.

521
00:29:09,761 --> 00:29:11,087
Only when you want to.

522
00:29:11,585 --> 00:29:12,792
You'll have a long wait, then.

523
00:29:12,892 --> 00:29:13,931
Not really, just 3 weeks.

524
00:29:14,031 --> 00:29:16,615
Tell me, does your grandfather
still own that telescope?

525
00:29:19,193 --> 00:29:20,425
He never lets go of it.

526
00:29:20,863 --> 00:29:22,028
Three weeks' time.

527
00:29:23,611 --> 00:29:25,081
But you've got to be certain.

528
00:29:25,426 --> 00:29:27,766
Cos when you come with me,
Donna... I'm sorry,

529
00:29:28,566 --> 00:29:29,699
so sorry, but...

530
00:29:31,966 --> 00:29:33,286
you're going to die.

531
00:29:50,795 --> 00:29:53,417
And you! I'll gonna
miss you most of all!

532
00:29:53,517 --> 00:29:55,630
All flame-haired and fiery!

533
00:29:56,352 --> 00:29:58,505
Oh, but why d'you have to go?

534
00:29:58,661 --> 00:30:01,797
It's the new law!
England for the English, et cetera.

535
00:30:02,047 --> 00:30:04,193
They can't send us home,
the oceans are closed,

536
00:30:04,293 --> 00:30:05,451
they build labour camps!

537
00:30:05,551 --> 00:30:08,660
I know, but labour doing what?
There aren't any jobs.

538
00:30:09,425 --> 00:30:12,350
Sewing, digging, is good!

539
00:30:12,610 --> 00:30:16,195
Now, stop it
before I kiss you too much...

540
00:30:18,215 --> 00:30:19,106
Wilfred!

541
00:30:20,125 --> 00:30:21,170
My capitano!

542
00:30:36,948 --> 00:30:38,562
<i>It'll be quiet with him gone.</i>

543
00:30:39,082 --> 00:30:40,950
<i>Still, we'll have more room.</i>

544
00:30:41,355 --> 00:30:42,341
Labour camps.

545
00:30:43,323 --> 00:30:45,169
That's what they called them last time.

546
00:30:45,732 --> 00:30:46,710
What d'you mean?

547
00:30:51,842 --> 00:30:52,950
It's happening again.

548
00:30:53,769 --> 00:30:54,557
What is?

549
00:31:00,802 --> 00:31:01,528
'Scuse me!

550
00:31:01,997 --> 00:31:03,561
'Scuse me, where
are you taking them?

551
00:31:04,212 --> 00:31:05,438
Where are you going?

552
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:07,503
Where are you going?

553
00:31:07,878 --> 00:31:09,524
Where are you going?!

554
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:12,760
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?!

555
00:31:31,036 --> 00:31:32,319
I asked about jobs.

556
00:31:33,045 --> 00:31:34,015
With the army.

557
00:31:34,859 --> 00:31:36,440
They said I wasn't qualified.

558
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:44,305
You were right. You said I should
have worked harder at school.

559
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:52,267
Suppose I've always
been a disappointment.

560
00:31:53,193 --> 00:31:53,906
Yeah.

561
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:11,893
You know we'd get a bit of cash
if we sold this thing.

562
00:32:12,212 --> 00:32:13,313
Don't you dare.

563
00:32:14,852 --> 00:32:19,904
I always imagined, your old age...
I'd have put a bit of money by.

564
00:32:20,349 --> 00:32:21,523
Make you comfy.

565
00:32:22,762 --> 00:32:23,675
Never did.

566
00:32:24,664 --> 00:32:25,797
I'm just useless.

567
00:32:29,782 --> 00:32:31,870
You're supposed to say,
"No, you're not."

568
00:32:33,079 --> 00:32:34,750
Ah, it must be the alignment...

569
00:32:34,850 --> 00:32:35,425
What's wrong?

570
00:32:35,525 --> 00:32:38,898
Well, I dunno, I mean it can't be
the lens cos I was looking at Orion,

571
00:32:38,998 --> 00:32:40,913
the constellation of Orion.

572
00:32:41,013 --> 00:32:44,047
You take a look.
Now, tell me, what can you see?

573
00:32:44,147 --> 00:32:46,600
- Where?
- Well, up there, in the sky!

574
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:51,180
Well, I can't see anything.
It's just black.

575
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:54,013
Well, I mean it's working.
The telescope is working.

576
00:32:54,113 --> 00:32:54,795
Well...

577
00:32:55,333 --> 00:32:57,454
- maybe it's the clouds.
- There's no clouds.

578
00:32:57,554 --> 00:32:59,425
- Well, there must be!
- There's not!

579
00:32:59,525 --> 00:33:03,808
It was there, an entire constellation.

580
00:33:06,329 --> 00:33:07,030
<i>Look!</i>

581
00:33:08,458 --> 00:33:09,158
Look there.

582
00:33:11,458 --> 00:33:12,384
<i>They're going out.</i>

583
00:33:13,485 --> 00:33:14,542
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

584
00:33:15,299 --> 00:33:18,110
Donna, the stars are going out.

585
00:33:26,621 --> 00:33:27,910
I'm ready.

586
00:33:45,899 --> 00:33:48,746
<i>Loadstone testing now at 15.4,</i>

587
00:33:48,846 --> 00:33:50,698
<i>repeat 15.4.</i>

588
00:33:53,634 --> 00:33:55,873
- Ma'am.
- I've told you, don't salute.

589
00:33:55,973 --> 00:33:58,113
Well, if you're not going
to tell us your name...

590
00:33:58,363 --> 00:33:59,542
What, you don't know either?

591
00:33:59,642 --> 00:34:02,383
I've crossed too many different
realities. Trust me, the wrong word

592
00:34:02,483 --> 00:34:06,030
in the wrong place can change
an entire causal nexus.

593
00:34:06,130 --> 00:34:08,240
She talks like that. A lot.

594
00:34:09,053 --> 00:34:11,287
And you must be... Miss Noble.

595
00:34:11,775 --> 00:34:12,538
Donna.

596
00:34:12,976 --> 00:34:15,360
Captain Erisa Magambo.
Thank you for this.

597
00:34:15,648 --> 00:34:17,731
- I don't even know what I'm doing.
- Is it awake?

598
00:34:17,831 --> 00:34:20,375
Seems to be quiet, today.
Ticking over.

599
00:34:20,847 --> 00:34:22,061
<i>Like it's waiting.</i>

600
00:34:23,049 --> 00:34:24,280
D'you want to see it?

601
00:34:26,259 --> 00:34:27,686
What's a "police box"?

602
00:34:27,786 --> 00:34:30,326
They salvaged it from underneath
the Thames. Just go inside.

603
00:34:30,426 --> 00:34:32,384
- What for?
- Just go in.

604
00:34:50,748 --> 00:34:52,494
<i>No way!</i>

605
00:35:24,297 --> 00:35:25,323
What d'you think?

606
00:35:28,489 --> 00:35:29,496
Can I have a coffee?

607
00:35:29,596 --> 00:35:31,709
Time And Relative Dimension in Space.

608
00:35:33,097 --> 00:35:34,580
This room used to shine with light.

609
00:35:35,287 --> 00:35:36,400
I think it's dying.

610
00:35:42,252 --> 00:35:43,670
It's still trying to help.

611
00:35:44,655 --> 00:35:47,038
And... it belonged to the Doctor?

612
00:35:47,138 --> 00:35:49,898
He was a Time Lord. Last of his kind.

613
00:35:50,173 --> 00:35:51,922
But if he was so special,

614
00:35:53,117 --> 00:35:54,280
what was he doing with me?

615
00:35:54,581 --> 00:35:55,820
He thought you were brilliant.

616
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,803
- Don't be stupid.
- But you are.

617
00:35:57,903 --> 00:36:00,843
It just took the Doctor to show you
that, simply by being with him.

618
00:36:01,363 --> 00:36:04,347
He did the same to me,
to everyone he touches.

619
00:36:06,994 --> 00:36:08,383
Were you and him...?

620
00:36:18,621 --> 00:36:20,270
- D'you want to see it?
- No.

621
00:36:24,749 --> 00:36:25,472
Go on, then.

622
00:36:25,650 --> 00:36:27,403
We don't know how the TARDIS works,

623
00:36:27,503 --> 00:36:29,827
but we've managed to scrape off
the surface technology,

624
00:36:29,927 --> 00:36:31,550
enough to show you the creature.

625
00:36:32,805 --> 00:36:33,739
It's a creature?

626
00:36:34,064 --> 00:36:35,078
Just stand here.

627
00:36:35,341 --> 00:36:36,680
Out of the circle, please.

628
00:36:38,356 --> 00:36:39,420
Yes, ma'am.

629
00:36:40,628 --> 00:36:41,935
Can't you stay with me?

630
00:36:43,312 --> 00:36:44,285
Ready?

631
00:36:44,899 --> 00:36:47,145
And... activate.

632
00:36:53,971 --> 00:36:56,455
- Open your eyes, Donna.
- Is it there?

633
00:36:56,555 --> 00:36:58,220
Open your eyes. Look at it.

634
00:36:59,515 --> 00:37:01,874
- I can't.
- It's part of you, Donna. Look.

635
00:37:11,688 --> 00:37:15,990
It's OK, it's OK, it's OK, calm down!
Donna, Donna, Donna! OK.

636
00:37:27,629 --> 00:37:28,324
What is it?

637
00:37:28,893 --> 00:37:29,988
We don't know.

638
00:37:30,351 --> 00:37:32,766
Oh... thanks!

639
00:37:33,170 --> 00:37:34,478
It feeds off time.

640
00:37:35,072 --> 00:37:37,994
By changing time, by making
someone's life take a different turn,

641
00:37:38,094 --> 00:37:41,217
like, er, meetings never made,

642
00:37:42,219 --> 00:37:43,726
<i>children never born, </i>

643
00:37:44,095 --> 00:37:45,337
a life never loved.

644
00:37:46,751 --> 00:37:49,804
- But with you it's...
- I never did anything important.

645
00:37:49,904 --> 00:37:53,408
Yes, you did. One day, that thing
made you turn right, instead of left.

646
00:37:53,508 --> 00:37:55,455
- When was that?
- You wouldn't remember.

647
00:37:55,555 --> 00:37:58,290
It was the most ordinary day
in the world. But by turning right,

648
00:37:58,559 --> 00:38:02,507
you never met the Doctor. And the whole
world just changed around you.

649
00:38:03,035 --> 00:38:04,630
Can you get rid of it?

650
00:38:04,890 --> 00:38:06,717
No, I can't even touch it.

651
00:38:07,749 --> 00:38:09,461
Seems to be in a state of flux.

652
00:38:10,187 --> 00:38:12,621
What does that mean?

653
00:38:12,959 --> 00:38:13,872
I don't know.

654
00:38:14,473 --> 00:38:16,313
Sort of thing the Doctor would say.

655
00:38:16,413 --> 00:38:17,432
You liar!

656
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,174
You told me I was special.

657
00:38:21,881 --> 00:38:25,785
But it's not me,
it's this thing, I'm just a host!

658
00:38:25,954 --> 00:38:27,962
No, there's more than that...

659
00:38:28,475 --> 00:38:29,859
The readings are strange.

660
00:38:30,397 --> 00:38:32,712
It's like reality is just
bending around you.

661
00:38:32,812 --> 00:38:34,702
Because of this thing!

662
00:38:34,802 --> 00:38:37,129
No, no, we're getting
separate readings from you.

663
00:38:37,353 --> 00:38:39,855
And they've always been there,
since the day you were born.

664
00:38:39,955 --> 00:38:42,145
This is not relevant to the mission.

665
00:38:42,683 --> 00:38:44,635
I thought it was just
the Doctor we needed,

666
00:38:45,468 --> 00:38:49,004
but it's the both of you.
The Doctor and Donna Noble. Together.

667
00:38:49,705 --> 00:38:51,432
To stop the stars from going out.

668
00:38:52,315 --> 00:38:53,177
Why?

669
00:38:54,738 --> 00:38:56,870
What can I do?

670
00:39:03,003 --> 00:39:04,200
Turn it off!

671
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:06,346
Please.

672
00:39:06,590 --> 00:39:08,185
- Captain.
- Power down.

673
00:39:17,034 --> 00:39:19,268
It's still there, though.

674
00:39:21,564 --> 00:39:22,503
What can I do...

675
00:39:23,576 --> 00:39:24,796
to get rid of it?

676
00:39:25,991 --> 00:39:27,470
You're going to travel in time!

677
00:39:27,730 --> 00:39:30,771
The TARDIS has tracked down the moment
of intervention, Monday the 25th,

678
00:39:30,871 --> 00:39:32,135
10:01 in the morning.

679
00:39:32,235 --> 00:39:35,430
Your car was on Little Sutton, leading
to Ealing Road, but you turned right,

680
00:39:35,530 --> 00:39:36,735
heading for Griffin's Parade.

681
00:39:36,835 --> 00:39:39,438
You need to turn left.
You've got to go back,

682
00:39:39,538 --> 00:39:40,750
turn left. Got that, Donna?

683
00:39:40,850 --> 00:39:44,415
At 10:01, make yourself turn left,
heading for the Chiswick High Road.

684
00:39:44,515 --> 00:39:47,698
Keep the jacket on at all times it's
insulation against temporal feedback.

685
00:39:47,798 --> 00:39:50,188
This will correspond to
local time wherever you land.

686
00:39:50,288 --> 00:39:52,430
This is to combat dehydration.

687
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:03,397
This is where we leave you.

688
00:40:03,497 --> 00:40:05,136
Don't want to see that thing on my back.

689
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:07,213
No, the mirrors are just incidental.

690
00:40:07,313 --> 00:40:09,355
<i>They bounce chronon
energy back into the centre,</i>

691
00:40:09,455 --> 00:40:12,308
which we control
and decide the destination.

692
00:40:12,671 --> 00:40:14,128
It's a time machine.

693
00:40:14,679 --> 00:40:16,137
It's a time machine.

694
00:40:16,456 --> 00:40:17,432
If you could...

695
00:40:24,032 --> 00:40:25,108
Powering up!

696
00:40:30,652 --> 00:40:32,936
- How d'you know it's gonna work?
- Hmm?

697
00:40:33,330 --> 00:40:38,030
Oh, we... we don't.
We're... we're just guessing.

698
00:40:40,473 --> 00:40:41,687
Brilliant!

699
00:40:41,787 --> 00:40:43,639
<i>Just remember,
when you get to the junction,</i>

700
00:40:43,739 --> 00:40:46,367
change the car's direction
by one minute past ten.

701
00:40:46,490 --> 00:40:48,550
- How do I do that?
- It's up to you.

702
00:40:48,945 --> 00:40:51,781
Well... I'll just have to...

703
00:40:52,225 --> 00:40:55,428
run up to myself and...
have a good argument.

704
00:40:55,803 --> 00:40:58,613
- I'd like to see that.
- Activate lodestone.

705
00:41:01,626 --> 00:41:02,521
Good luck.

706
00:41:03,291 --> 00:41:05,350
- I'm ready!
- One minute past ten.

707
00:41:05,837 --> 00:41:07,439
Cos I understand now!

708
00:41:08,152 --> 00:41:09,804
You said I was gonna die, but...

709
00:41:10,104 --> 00:41:14,590
you mean this whole world,
it's gonna blink out of existence...

710
00:41:15,075 --> 00:41:18,888
but that's not dying,
cos a better world takes its place.

711
00:41:19,476 --> 00:41:20,519
The Doctor's world!

712
00:41:21,414 --> 00:41:22,671
<i>And I'm still alive!</i>

713
00:41:24,811 --> 00:41:27,795
That's right, isn't it?
I don't die. If I change things,

714
00:41:27,895 --> 00:41:31,444
I don't die. That's...
that's right, isn't it?

715
00:41:35,736 --> 00:41:36,590
I'm sorry.

716
00:41:37,350 --> 00:41:38,710
But I can't die!

717
00:41:40,322 --> 00:41:41,670
<i>I've got a future!</i>

718
00:41:42,706 --> 00:41:45,070
With the Doctor, you told me!

719
00:41:46,210 --> 00:41:47,223
Activate!

720
00:42:22,091 --> 00:42:22,740
But...

721
00:42:23,535 --> 00:42:25,556
Hold on... But this is...

722
00:42:26,419 --> 00:42:27,320
I'm not...

723
00:42:28,972 --> 00:42:30,361
This is Sutton Court!

724
00:42:31,853 --> 00:42:35,375
I'm half a mile away!
I'M HALF A MILE AWAY!

725
00:42:38,730 --> 00:42:39,936
Four minutes.

726
00:42:41,394 --> 00:42:42,395
Oh, my God!

727
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:48,339
Jival Chowdry,

728
00:42:49,509 --> 00:42:52,432
he runs that little photocopy
business in Merchant Street

729
00:42:52,532 --> 00:42:54,197
and he needs a secretary.

730
00:42:54,366 --> 00:42:55,980
I've got a job!

731
00:43:04,060 --> 00:43:08,771
HC Clements is in the city.
It's nice, it's posh,

732
00:43:08,955 --> 00:43:10,327
so stop it!

733
00:43:20,541 --> 00:43:23,000
It won't take long,
just turn right.

734
00:43:25,427 --> 00:43:27,870
I'm going left, if you don't like it,
get out and walk!

735
00:43:30,235 --> 00:43:31,634
You think I'm so useless.

736
00:43:31,734 --> 00:43:34,946
Oh, I know why you want
a job with HC Clements, lady.

737
00:43:35,046 --> 00:43:36,810
Cos you think you'll meet a man.

738
00:43:44,170 --> 00:43:45,600
I'm not gonna get there.

739
00:43:51,068 --> 00:43:52,200
You're gonna die.

740
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:03,225
City executives don't need
temps, except for practice.

741
00:44:04,667 --> 00:44:05,280
Yeah.

742
00:44:06,193 --> 00:44:07,550
Suppose you're right.

743
00:44:12,647 --> 00:44:13,430
Please.

744
00:44:20,816 --> 00:44:22,470
Can you hear that?

745
00:44:23,206 --> 00:44:25,965
- Oh, no! Go back!
- Oi! Get a move on!

746
00:44:27,886 --> 00:44:30,968
- The traffic's stopping.
- Something must've happened.

747
00:44:40,887 --> 00:44:41,932
Tell him this.

748
00:44:43,058 --> 00:44:44,191
Two words.

749
00:44:55,179 --> 00:44:57,815
Well, that decides it.
I'm not sitting in a traffic jam.

750
00:44:58,034 --> 00:44:59,564
<i>I'm going left! I'm going left!</i>

751
00:44:59,664 --> 00:45:00,890
<i>Left... left... left...</i>

752
00:45:05,450 --> 00:45:06,430
<i>Left...</i>

753
00:45:06,602 --> 00:45:08,270
<i>Left... left...</i>

754
00:45:21,194 --> 00:45:23,190
What the hell is that?!

755
00:45:23,290 --> 00:45:25,048
You were so strong.

756
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:27,826
What are you?

757
00:45:28,495 --> 00:45:30,275
What will you be?

758
00:45:31,801 --> 00:45:33,253
<i>What will you be?</i>

759
00:45:36,462 --> 00:45:37,488
Everything all right?

760
00:45:38,427 --> 00:45:39,524
Oh, God...!

761
00:45:41,995 --> 00:45:43,365
What was that for?!

762
00:45:44,303 --> 00:45:45,398
I don't know!

763
00:45:53,114 --> 00:45:54,403
<i>Can't remember.</i>

764
00:45:55,660 --> 00:45:56,900
It's slipping away.

765
00:45:58,432 --> 00:46:01,510
You know, like when you think
of a dream, and it sort of goes.

766
00:46:02,167 --> 00:46:03,362
Just got lucky, this thing.

767
00:46:03,612 --> 00:46:05,183
It's one of the Trickster's Brigade.

768
00:46:06,259 --> 00:46:08,217
Changes a life in tiny little ways.

769
00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:11,475
Most times, the universe just
compensates around it, but with you...

770
00:46:12,063 --> 00:46:14,196
great big parallel world!

771
00:46:15,316 --> 00:46:18,138
Hold on, you said
parallel worlds are sealed off.

772
00:46:18,395 --> 00:46:19,160
They are.

773
00:46:19,423 --> 00:46:21,110
But you had one created around you.

774
00:46:22,163 --> 00:46:25,270
Funny thing is...
seems to be happening a lot. To you.

775
00:46:26,211 --> 00:46:27,081
How d'you mean?

776
00:46:27,181 --> 00:46:29,141
Well, the Library. Then this.

777
00:46:29,942 --> 00:46:33,320
Just goes with the job, I suppose.

778
00:46:33,633 --> 00:46:36,661
Sometimes I think there's way
too much coincidence around you, Donna.

779
00:46:36,968 --> 00:46:40,015
I met you once. Then I met
your grandfather. Then I met you again.

780
00:46:40,225 --> 00:46:43,228
In the whole wide universe,
I met you for a second time.

781
00:46:44,623 --> 00:46:46,625
It's like something's
binding us together.

782
00:46:47,895 --> 00:46:50,373
Don't be so daft.
I'm nothing special.

783
00:46:50,473 --> 00:46:52,218
Yes, you are, you're brilliant.

784
00:46:53,683 --> 00:46:54,915
He thought you were brilliant.

785
00:46:57,149 --> 00:46:58,168
SHE said that.

786
00:46:59,340 --> 00:47:00,072
Who did?

787
00:47:00,391 --> 00:47:01,173
That woman.

788
00:47:02,186 --> 00:47:03,463
I can't remember...

789
00:47:03,563 --> 00:47:05,058
She never existed, now.

790
00:47:05,502 --> 00:47:06,591
No, but she said...

791
00:47:07,117 --> 00:47:08,070
<i>The stars...</i>

792
00:47:10,779 --> 00:47:12,393
She said the stars are going out.

793
00:47:12,493 --> 00:47:15,670
- Yeah, but that world's gone.
- No, but she said it was all worlds.

794
00:47:15,997 --> 00:47:17,098
Every world.

795
00:47:18,080 --> 00:47:20,215
She said the darkness is coming.

796
00:47:20,684 --> 00:47:22,350
- Even here.
- Who was she?

797
00:47:22,693 --> 00:47:25,033
- I don't know.
- What did she look like?

798
00:47:26,009 --> 00:47:26,803
She was...

799
00:47:28,364 --> 00:47:29,180
blonde.

800
00:47:29,379 --> 00:47:30,236
What was her name?

801
00:47:30,336 --> 00:47:32,240
- I don't know.
- Donna, what was her name?

802
00:47:34,860 --> 00:47:35,870
But she told me...

803
00:47:36,374 --> 00:47:37,337
<i>to warn you.</i>

804
00:47:37,994 --> 00:47:39,780
She said... two words.

805
00:47:39,931 --> 00:47:42,040
What two words? What were they?
What did she say?

806
00:47:48,058 --> 00:47:49,141
"Bad Wolf."

807
00:47:51,595 --> 00:47:52,720
What does it mean?

808
00:48:15,232 --> 00:48:16,490
Doctor, what is it?

809
00:48:17,109 --> 00:48:18,467
What's Bad Wolf?

810
00:48:19,700 --> 00:48:21,609
It's the end of the universe.

811
00:48:35,221 --> 00:48:37,617
Ladies and gentlemen, we are at war.

812
00:48:37,810 --> 00:48:40,070
- It can't be.
- There's nothing I can do.

813
00:48:40,225 --> 00:48:43,215
- Oh, my God!
- What is it, who are they?

814
00:48:43,466 --> 00:48:44,748
What are we going to do?

815
00:48:45,568 --> 00:48:46,670
It's impossible.

816
00:48:47,091 --> 00:48:48,374
It can't be!

817
00:48:48,743 --> 00:48:50,288
I'm sorry, we're dead.

818
00:48:50,388 --> 00:48:51,652
Doctor, come back!

819
00:48:53,329 --> 00:48:54,887
It's only just beginning.

820
