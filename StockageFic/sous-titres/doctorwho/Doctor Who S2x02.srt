1
00:00:01,587 --> 00:00:08,789
In his scariest adventure yet,
the Doctor comes face to face
with a werewolf.

2
00:00:17,887 --> 00:00:21,565
Come now, Father,
you should know better.

3
00:00:21,605 --> 00:00:24,682
You're not welcome here,
and especially not today.

4
00:00:24,722 --> 00:00:28,239
I've got no time to start old
arguments. We want only one thing.

5
00:00:28,279 --> 00:00:30,473
And what would that be?

6
00:00:30,513 --> 00:00:32,390
This house.

7
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:34,150
You want the house?

8
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:37,468
We will take the house. Would you
like my wife while you're at it?

9
00:00:37,508 --> 00:00:40,224
If you won't stand aside,
we'll take it by force.

10
00:00:40,264 --> 00:00:43,141
By what power? The hand of God?

11
00:00:43,181 --> 00:00:46,976
No, the fist of man.

12
00:00:47,016 --> 00:00:49,934
Aghhh! Aghhh!

13
00:00:51,495 --> 00:00:52,689
Aghhh!

14
00:01:33,368 --> 00:01:34,881
MAIDS SCREAM

15
00:01:50,511 --> 00:01:52,867
What in the name of heaven?

16
00:01:52,907 --> 00:01:55,324
My lady?

17
00:02:02,096 --> 00:02:03,449
What's in there?

18
00:02:03,496 --> 00:02:06,973
What is it, what's
under that canvas?

19
00:02:07,013 --> 00:02:08,861
Father, answer me. What's in there?

20
00:02:09,689 --> 00:02:12,192
May God forgive me.

21
00:02:15,803 --> 00:02:18,954
Aghhhhhhhh!

22
00:02:59,996 --> 00:03:03,790
What d'you think of this?
For the late 1970s you'd be
better off in a bin bag.

23
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:10,904
Listen. Ian Dury and the Blockheads.
Number one in 1979.

24
00:03:10,944 --> 00:03:12,741
You're a punk!

25
00:03:12,781 --> 00:03:18,215
# It's good to be a lunatic. . . #
That's what you are, a big old punk,
with a bit of rockabilly thrown in.

26
00:03:18,255 --> 00:03:22,372
Want to go and see him?
You mean in concert?
What else is a Tardis for?

27
00:03:22,412 --> 00:03:25,966
I can take you to the
Battle of Trafalgar,
the Antigravity Olympics,

28
00:03:26,006 --> 00:03:27,766
Caesar crossing the Rubicon,

29
00:03:27,806 --> 00:03:33,997
or Ian Dury at the Top Rank,
Sheffield, England, Earth, 21st
November 1979, what d'you think?

30
00:03:34,037 --> 00:03:36,534
Sheffield it is! Hold on tight!

31
00:03:41,992 --> 00:03:46,066
# Hit me with your rhythm stick
Hit me, hit me. . . #

32
00:03:46,106 --> 00:03:47,590
Aghhhh! Laandiing!

33
00:03:48,026 --> 00:03:52,861
Stop!
THEY LAUGH

34
00:03:53,299 --> 00:03:56,376
1979, hell of a year.

35
00:03:56,416 --> 00:03:57,973
China invades Vietnam,

36
00:03:58,013 --> 00:04:00,250
The Muppet Movie, love that film.

37
00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:04,568
Margaret Thatcher, urgh!
Skylab falls to Earth,
with a little help from me.

38
00:04:04,608 --> 00:04:07,405
Nearly took off my thumb,
and I like my thumb.

39
00:04:07,445 --> 00:04:11,501
GUN COCKS
I need my thumb, I'm very
attached to. . . my thumb.

40
00:04:14,196 --> 00:04:17,113
1879. Same difference.

41
00:04:17,153 --> 00:04:21,426
You'll explain your presence,
and the nakedness of this girl.

42
00:04:21,466 --> 00:04:24,504
Are we in Scotland?
How can you be ignorant of that?

43
00:04:24,544 --> 00:04:26,701
Oh, I'm dazed and confused.

44
00:04:26,741 --> 00:04:30,659
I've been chasing this wee naked
child over hill and over dale.

45
00:04:30,699 --> 00:04:34,494
In't that right,
ye. . .timorous beastie?

46
00:04:34,534 --> 00:04:36,412
Och, aye.

47
00:04:36,452 --> 00:04:38,089
I've been oot and aboot.

48
00:04:38,129 --> 00:04:39,809
No, don't do that.

49
00:04:39,849 --> 00:04:41,449
Hoots mon?

50
00:04:41,489 --> 00:04:43,006
No, really, don't. Really.

51
00:04:43,046 --> 00:04:45,243
Identify yourself, sir.

52
00:04:45,283 --> 00:04:50,278
I'm Dr James McCrimmon,
from the township of. . . Balamory.

53
00:04:50,318 --> 00:04:53,554
I have my credentials, if I may. . . ?

54
00:04:58,188 --> 00:05:01,385
As you can see, a doctorate
from the University of Edinburgh.

55
00:05:01,425 --> 00:05:06,140
I trained under Dr Bell himself.
Let them approach.

56
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:09,587
I don't think that's wise, ma'am.
Let them approach.

57
00:05:11,854 --> 00:05:14,411
You will approach the carriage.

58
00:05:14,451 --> 00:05:17,198
And show all due deference.

59
00:05:28,594 --> 00:05:32,869
Rose, might I introduce
Her Majesty Queen Victoria,

60
00:05:32,909 --> 00:05:36,467
Empress of India,
and Defender of the Faith.

61
00:05:36,507 --> 00:05:41,620
Rose Tyler, ma'am. And my
apologies. . .for being so naked.

62
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:44,138
I've had five daughters,
it's nothing to me.

63
00:05:44,178 --> 00:05:45,737
But you, Doctor -

64
00:05:45,777 --> 00:05:47,705
show me these credentials.

65
00:05:51,732 --> 00:05:53,849
Why didn't you say so immediately?

66
00:05:53,889 --> 00:05:58,606
It states clearly here
that you have been appointed
by the Lord Provost as my protector.

67
00:05:58,646 --> 00:06:01,680
Does it? Yes, it does. Good, good!

68
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:07,831
Then let me ask, why's your Majesty
travelling by road, when there's
a train all the way to Aberdeen?

69
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:11,631
A tree on the line. An accident?

70
00:06:11,671 --> 00:06:15,786
I am the Queen of the United Kingdom
of Great Britain and Ireland,

71
00:06:15,826 --> 00:06:17,982
everything around me
tends to be planned.

72
00:06:18,022 --> 00:06:20,380
An assassination attempt?

73
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:23,816
What, seriously?
There's people out to kill ya?

74
00:06:23,856 --> 00:06:25,974
I'm used to staring
down the barrel of a gun.

75
00:06:26,014 --> 00:06:28,573
Sir Robert MacLeish
lives but ten miles hence.

76
00:06:28,613 --> 00:06:30,373
We've sent word ahead.

77
00:06:30,413 --> 00:06:33,368
He'll shelter us,
then we'll reach Balmoral tomorrow.

78
00:06:33,408 --> 00:06:37,684
This doctor and his "timorous
beastie" will come with us.

79
00:06:37,724 --> 00:06:41,996
Yes, ma'am. We'd better get
moving, it's almost nightfall.

80
00:06:42,036 --> 00:06:45,633
Indeed. And there are stories
of wolves in these parts.

81
00:06:45,673 --> 00:06:48,709
Fanciful tales,
intended to scare the children.

82
00:06:48,749 --> 00:06:51,746
But good for the blood, I think.
Drive on.

83
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:59,618
It's funny, cos you say
assassination, and you just think
of Kennedy and stuff.

84
00:06:59,658 --> 00:07:02,695
Not 'er. 1879, she's had, ooh,

85
00:07:02,735 --> 00:07:06,132
six attempts on her life.
And I'll tell you something else,

86
00:07:06,172 --> 00:07:10,049
we just met Queen Victoria!
I know!   What a laugh!
She was just sitting there.

87
00:07:10,089 --> 00:07:14,243
Like a stamp. I want her to say,
"We are not amused. "

88
00:07:14,283 --> 00:07:16,401
Bet you five quid
I can make her say it.

89
00:07:16,441 --> 00:07:20,074
If I gambled, it'd be
an abuse of my privilege
as a traveller in time.

90
00:07:20,114 --> 00:07:22,326
Ten quid. Done.

91
00:07:33,025 --> 00:07:36,539
I can't do this. It's treason.

92
00:07:36,579 --> 00:07:39,257
Then your wife
will suffer the consequences.

93
00:07:39,297 --> 00:07:41,653
And believe me, Sir Robert,

94
00:07:41,693 --> 00:07:43,621
she will be devoured.

95
00:07:59,876 --> 00:08:02,870
Your Majesty. Sir Robert.

96
00:08:02,910 --> 00:08:04,987
My apologies for the emergency.

97
00:08:05,027 --> 00:08:06,708
And how is Lady Isobel?

98
00:08:06,748 --> 00:08:10,104
She's. . . indisposed, I'm afraid.

99
00:08:10,144 --> 00:08:12,460
She's gone to
Edinburgh for the season.

100
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:15,578
She's taken the cook.
The kitchens are barely stocked.

101
00:08:15,618 --> 00:08:18,655
I wouldn't blame your Majesty
if you wanted to ride on. No!

102
00:08:18,695 --> 00:08:24,129
I've had quite enough carriage
exercise, and this is. . .charming. . .

103
00:08:24,169 --> 00:08:28,686
if rustic. It's my first
visit to this house.

104
00:08:28,726 --> 00:08:31,241
My late husband spoke of it often.

105
00:08:31,281 --> 00:08:33,116
The Torchwood Estate.

106
00:08:33,156 --> 00:08:36,434
Now, shall we go inside?

107
00:08:36,474 --> 00:08:38,551
And please excuse the naked girl.

108
00:08:38,591 --> 00:08:44,148
Sorry! She's a feral child. I bought
her for sixpence in old London town.

109
00:08:44,188 --> 00:08:45,785
It was her or the Elephant Man.

110
00:08:45,825 --> 00:08:49,662
Thinks he's funny, but I'm so not
amused. What do you think, ma'am?

111
00:08:49,702 --> 00:08:51,579
It hardly matters.

112
00:08:51,619 --> 00:08:53,262
Shall we proceed?

113
00:08:54,856 --> 00:08:57,333
So close.

114
00:08:57,373 --> 00:09:01,190
Mackeson and Ramsay, you will
escort the property,
hurry up. Yes, sir.

115
00:09:07,759 --> 00:09:09,918
So what's in there, then?

116
00:09:09,958 --> 00:09:11,478
Property of the Crown.

117
00:09:11,518 --> 00:09:13,821
You will dismiss
any further thoughts, sir.

118
00:09:14,596 --> 00:09:16,711
The rest of you,
go to the rear.

119
00:09:16,751 --> 00:09:18,710
Assume your designated positions.

120
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:21,247
You heard the orders.
Positions! Sir.

121
00:09:32,695 --> 00:09:35,812
Shhhhh.

122
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:49,948
Guard it with your life.

123
00:09:54,190 --> 00:09:58,068
This, I take it,
is the famous endeavour.

124
00:09:58,108 --> 00:10:00,384
All my father's work.

125
00:10:00,424 --> 00:10:02,702
Built by hand, in his final years.

126
00:10:02,742 --> 00:10:04,819
It became something of an obsession.

127
00:10:04,859 --> 00:10:08,459
He spent his money on this,
rather than caring for
the house, or himself.

128
00:10:08,499 --> 00:10:11,176
I wish I'd met him. I like him.

129
00:10:11,216 --> 00:10:13,533
That thing's beautiful. Can I. . . ?
Help yourself.

130
00:10:13,573 --> 00:10:16,450
What did he model it on?
I know nothing about it.

131
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:18,887
To be honest,
most of us thought him. . .

132
00:10:18,927 --> 00:10:21,264
shall we say, eccentric. Hah!

133
00:10:24,038 --> 00:10:27,895
I wish now I'd spent more time with
him. And listened to his stories.

134
00:10:29,355 --> 00:10:32,232
It's a bit rubbish.
How many prisms has it got?

135
00:10:32,272 --> 00:10:39,024
Way too many! The magnification's
gone right over the top, that's a
stupid. . .am I being rude again? Yep.

136
00:10:39,064 --> 00:10:40,901
But it's pretty!

137
00:10:40,941 --> 00:10:44,697
It's very pretty.
And the imagination of it
should be applauded.

138
00:10:44,737 --> 00:10:47,055
I thought you might
disapprove, Your Majesty.

139
00:10:47,095 --> 00:10:48,614
Star gazing.

140
00:10:48,654 --> 00:10:50,931
Isn't that a bit fanciful?

141
00:10:50,971 --> 00:10:55,569
You could easily. . . not
be amused, or something. No?

142
00:10:55,609 --> 00:11:00,439
This device surveys
the infinite work of God.

143
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:02,877
What could be finer?

144
00:11:02,917 --> 00:11:06,354
Sir Robert's father was
an example to us all. A polymath,

145
00:11:06,394 --> 00:11:12,867
steeped in astronomy and the
sciences, yet equally well versed
in folklore and fairytales.

146
00:11:12,907 --> 00:11:15,244
Stars and magic.
I like him more and more.

147
00:11:15,985 --> 00:11:19,624
Oh, my late husband
enjoyed his company.

148
00:11:19,664 --> 00:11:26,173
Prince Albert himself was acquainted
with many rural superstitions,
coming as he did from Saxe-Coburg.

149
00:11:26,213 --> 00:11:27,731
That's Bavaria.

150
00:11:28,812 --> 00:11:34,086
When Albert was told about your
local wolf, he was transported.

151
00:11:34,126 --> 00:11:39,285
What's this wolf, then?
It's just a story. Then tell it.

152
00:11:42,515 --> 00:11:45,513
It's said. . . Excuse me, sir. . .

153
00:11:45,553 --> 00:11:49,189
perhaps her Majesty's party
could repair to their rooms.

154
00:11:49,229 --> 00:11:50,872
It's almost dark.

155
00:11:52,705 --> 00:11:56,620
Of course. Yes, of course.
And then supper.

156
00:11:56,660 --> 00:12:01,378
And could we find some clothes
for Miss Tyler?

157
00:12:01,418 --> 00:12:03,853
I'm tired of nakedness.

158
00:12:03,893 --> 00:12:06,151
It's not amusing, is it?

159
00:12:07,091 --> 00:12:11,006
Sir Robert, your wife must have
left some clothes. See to it.

160
00:12:11,046 --> 00:12:14,759
We shall dine at seven,
and talk some more of this wolf.

161
00:12:14,799 --> 00:12:18,331
After all, there is
a full moon tonight.

162
00:12:19,357 --> 00:12:20,870
So there is, ma'am.

163
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:14,808
Ughhh!

164
00:13:32,797 --> 00:13:34,437
They came through the house.

165
00:13:34,477 --> 00:13:38,951
In silence. Took the steward,
and the master, and my lady.

166
00:13:38,991 --> 00:13:40,551
Listen, I've got a friend,

167
00:13:40,591 --> 00:13:42,147
he's called the Doctor.

168
00:13:42,187 --> 00:13:43,625
He'll know what to do.

169
00:13:43,665 --> 00:13:45,905
Come with me.
Oh, but I can't, miss.

170
00:13:45,945 --> 00:13:47,545
What's your name?

171
00:13:47,585 --> 00:13:49,382
Flora.

172
00:13:49,422 --> 00:13:52,538
Flora, we'll be safe.

173
00:13:52,578 --> 00:13:55,973
There's more people arrived
downstairs, they can help us.

174
00:13:56,013 --> 00:13:58,555
I promise. Come on.

175
00:14:00,650 --> 00:14:02,584
OK? Come on.

176
00:14:12,635 --> 00:14:15,422
Oh, miss, I did warn you!

177
00:14:17,070 --> 00:14:19,029
He's not dead. I don't think.

178
00:14:19,069 --> 00:14:21,146
He must be drugged, or something.

179
00:14:21,186 --> 00:14:23,603
Agggh! Agggh!

180
00:14:33,015 --> 00:14:34,731
Your companion begs an apology.

181
00:14:34,771 --> 00:14:36,932
Her clothing has
somewhat delayed her.

182
00:14:36,972 --> 00:14:38,968
That's all right,
save her a bit of ham.

183
00:14:39,008 --> 00:14:42,283
The feral child could
probably eat it raw.

184
00:14:42,323 --> 00:14:44,239
Ha! Very wise, ma'am ! Very witty!

185
00:14:44,279 --> 00:14:46,519
Slightly witty, perhaps.

186
00:14:46,559 --> 00:14:50,833
I know you rarely get the chance
to dine with me, Captain,
but don't get too excited.

187
00:14:50,873 --> 00:14:57,187
I shall contain my wit in case I do
you further injury. Yes, ma'am.

188
00:14:57,227 --> 00:15:00,065
Sorry, ma'am. We're all
waiting on Sir Robert.

189
00:15:00,105 --> 00:15:03,102
Come, sir. You promised
us a tale of nightmares.

190
00:15:03,142 --> 00:15:08,179
Indeed. Since my husband's death,
I find myself with more of a taste
for supernatural fiction.

191
00:15:08,219 --> 00:15:09,737
You must miss him.

192
00:15:11,415 --> 00:15:12,939
Very much.

193
00:15:15,969 --> 00:15:17,493
Oh, completely.

194
00:15:19,444 --> 00:15:22,000
And that's the charm of
a ghost story, isn't it?

195
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:25,518
Not the scares and the chills,
that's just for children, but the. . .

196
00:15:25,558 --> 00:15:29,249
hope of some contact
with the great beyond.

197
00:15:30,072 --> 00:15:34,829
We all want some message
from that place.

198
00:15:34,869 --> 00:15:39,698
It's the Creator's greatest mystery,
that we're allowed no
such consolation.

199
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:43,872
The dead stay silent.

200
00:15:46,338 --> 00:15:48,056
And we must wait.

201
00:15:52,411 --> 00:15:55,803
But come, begin your tale,
Sir Robert.

202
00:15:55,843 --> 00:15:57,562
There's a chill in the air,

203
00:15:57,602 --> 00:16:01,578
the wind is howling through
the eaves. Tell us of monsters.

204
00:16:05,194 --> 00:16:06,753
Don't make a sound.

205
00:16:06,793 --> 00:16:10,628
They said if we scream or shout,
then he will slaughter us.

206
00:16:10,668 --> 00:16:13,707
But. . . he's in a cage.

207
00:16:13,747 --> 00:16:15,585
He's a prisoner,
he's the same as us.

208
00:16:15,625 --> 00:16:18,421
He's nothing like us.

209
00:16:18,461 --> 00:16:20,844
That creature's not mortal.

210
00:16:27,256 --> 00:16:30,170
The story goes back 300 years.

211
00:16:30,210 --> 00:16:33,564
Every full moon, the howling
rings through the valley.

212
00:16:33,604 --> 00:16:39,638
Next morning, livestock is found,
ripped apart and. . .devoured.

213
00:16:39,678 --> 00:16:43,395
Tales like this just
disguise the work of thieves.

214
00:16:43,435 --> 00:16:45,952
Steal a sheep, blame a wolf,
simple as that.

215
00:16:45,992 --> 00:16:48,509
But sometimes a child goes missing.

216
00:16:48,549 --> 00:16:53,014
Once in a generation, a boy
will vanish from his homestead.

217
00:16:55,223 --> 00:16:56,827
Don't, child.

218
00:17:06,170 --> 00:17:08,646
Who are you? Don't enrage him.

219
00:17:08,686 --> 00:17:10,486
Where are you from?

220
00:17:10,526 --> 00:17:12,169
You're not from Earth.

221
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:17,479
What planet are you from? Ohhh.

222
00:17:17,519 --> 00:17:19,196
Intelligence.

223
00:17:19,236 --> 00:17:21,712
Where were you born?

224
00:17:21,752 --> 00:17:24,270
This body?

225
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:27,227
Ten miles away.

226
00:17:27,267 --> 00:17:29,785
A weakling, heartsick boy

227
00:17:29,825 --> 00:17:34,006
stolen away at night by the
Brethren for my. . .cultivation.

228
00:17:35,578 --> 00:17:40,456
I carved out his soul
and sat in his heart.

229
00:17:40,496 --> 00:17:43,809
Are there descriptions
of the creature? Oh, yes, Doctor.

230
00:17:43,849 --> 00:17:47,167
Drawings, and wood carvings.

231
00:17:47,207 --> 00:17:49,124
And it's not merely a wolf.

232
00:17:49,164 --> 00:17:52,160
It's more than that.

233
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:55,482
This is a man who becomes an animal.

234
00:17:57,914 --> 00:17:59,434
A werewolf?

235
00:17:59,474 --> 00:18:03,588
All right, so the body's human.

236
00:18:03,628 --> 00:18:05,226
What about you?

237
00:18:05,266 --> 00:18:07,505
The thing inside?

238
00:18:07,545 --> 00:18:10,820
So far from home.

239
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:13,260
If you want to get
back home, we can help.

240
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:16,098
Why would I leave this place?

241
00:18:16,138 --> 00:18:21,171
A world of industry, of workforce,
and warfare.

242
00:18:21,211 --> 00:18:25,605
I could turn it to such purpose.
How would you do that?

243
00:18:25,645 --> 00:18:28,243
I would migrate to the holy monarch.

244
00:18:28,283 --> 00:18:35,752
You mean Queen Victoria? With one
bite, I would pass into her blood.

245
00:18:35,792 --> 00:18:39,233
And then it begins,
the Empire of the Wolf.

246
00:18:40,390 --> 00:18:42,608
Many questions.

247
00:18:45,304 --> 00:18:47,301
Look!

248
00:18:47,341 --> 00:18:49,902
Inside your eyes.
You've seen it too.

249
00:18:49,942 --> 00:18:53,178
Seen what? The wolf. There is
something of the wolf about you.

250
00:18:55,575 --> 00:18:57,873
I don't know what you mean.

251
00:18:59,332 --> 00:19:01,166
You burnt like the Sun.

252
00:19:01,206 --> 00:19:05,182
But all I require is the Moon.

253
00:19:07,961 --> 00:19:10,158
My father didn't treat
it as a story.

254
00:19:10,198 --> 00:19:12,074
He said it was fact.

255
00:19:12,114 --> 00:19:15,112
He even claimed to have
communed with the beast,

256
00:19:15,152 --> 00:19:16,989
to have learned its purpose.

257
00:19:17,029 --> 00:19:20,069
I should have listened.

258
00:19:20,109 --> 00:19:23,346
His work was hindered.
He made enemies.

259
00:19:23,386 --> 00:19:26,063
There's a monastery in
the Glen of St Catherine.

260
00:19:26,103 --> 00:19:29,301
The Brethren opposed
my father's investigations.

261
00:19:29,341 --> 00:19:32,813
Perhaps they thought his work
ungodly. That's what I thought.

262
00:19:32,853 --> 00:19:40,084
But now I wonder. . .what if
they had a different reason
for wanting the story kept quiet?

263
00:19:40,124 --> 00:19:42,922
What if they turned from God

264
00:19:42,962 --> 00:19:44,799
and worshipped the wolf?

265
00:19:44,839 --> 00:19:48,974
And what if they were
with us right now?

266
00:19:56,707 --> 00:19:58,959
Moonlight. . .

267
00:20:19,123 --> 00:20:23,078
All of you, stop looking at it.
Flora, don't look, listen to me.

268
00:20:23,118 --> 00:20:26,714
Grab hold of the chain, and pull!
Come on! With me! Pull!

269
00:20:26,754 --> 00:20:32,192
We can't, miss, we can't!
The Brethren. . . I said pull!
Stop your whining and listen to me.

270
00:20:32,232 --> 00:20:37,266
And that means you, Your Ladyship!
Now, come on! Pull!

271
00:20:38,025 --> 00:20:39,583
What is the meaning of this?

272
00:20:39,623 --> 00:20:41,103
Sorry, they've got my wife.

273
00:20:41,143 --> 00:20:43,765
Where's Rose? Where is she?
Sir Robert! Come on!

274
00:20:47,497 --> 00:20:50,494
Aghhhhhhhh! Aghhhhhhh!

275
00:20:50,534 --> 00:20:54,884
Roarrrrrrrr! Roarrrrrr!

276
00:20:54,924 --> 00:21:01,960
Quick! Pull. . .
One, two, three, pull!

277
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:07,312
Tell me, sir, I demand to know
your intention. Lupus deus est. . .

278
00:21:07,352 --> 00:21:08,950
What is it that you want?

279
00:21:11,907 --> 00:21:13,665
The throne.

280
00:21:13,705 --> 00:21:14,905
Ahhhhh!

281
00:21:19,862 --> 00:21:24,494
Roarrrrrr! Roarrrrr!
One! Two! Three! Pull!

282
00:21:24,534 --> 00:21:30,592
One. . .two. . .three. . . Pull!

283
00:21:37,841 --> 00:21:40,378
Where the hell have you been?

284
00:21:42,474 --> 00:21:44,772
Oh, that's beautiful.

285
00:21:46,749 --> 00:21:48,922
Get out! All of you.

286
00:21:50,148 --> 00:21:51,666
WOLF ROARS
Out! Out! Out!

287
00:21:51,706 --> 00:21:52,906
Out! Out! Come on!

288
00:21:52,946 --> 00:21:54,669
Roarrrrr! Roarrrrr!

289
00:21:56,779 --> 00:21:59,486
Roarrrrr!

290
00:22:01,497 --> 00:22:04,173
Howwwwlllll!

291
00:22:04,213 --> 00:22:07,565
I take it, sir, that you
halted my train, to bring me here.

292
00:22:07,605 --> 00:22:12,241
We've waited so long for one of your
journeys to coincide with the Moon.

293
00:22:12,281 --> 00:22:14,399
Then you have waited in vain.

294
00:22:14,439 --> 00:22:18,035
After six attempts on my life,

295
00:22:18,075 --> 00:22:21,482
I am hardly unprepared.

296
00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:24,804
Oh, I don't think so, woman.

297
00:22:25,830 --> 00:22:30,223
The correct form of address
is "Your Majesty".
BANG

298
00:22:30,263 --> 00:22:32,262
At arms. . .

299
00:22:32,302 --> 00:22:35,577
Lady Isobel, take the girls!
Get them out through the kitchen.

300
00:22:35,617 --> 00:22:37,776
Robert, I can't leave.
What will you do?

301
00:22:37,816 --> 00:22:41,052
I must defend Her Majesty.
Now, don't think of me, just go.

302
00:22:42,535 --> 00:22:45,166
All of you! At my side! Come on!

303
00:22:45,206 --> 00:22:47,723
Could be any species triggered
by wavelengths.

304
00:22:47,763 --> 00:22:51,659
Did it say what it wanted?
The Queen, the crown,
the throne, you name it.

305
00:22:58,515 --> 00:23:02,149
GROWLING

306
00:23:02,189 --> 00:23:09,223
Grrrrrr! Grrrrrr! Grrrrrr! Grrrrrr!
Grrrrrr! Grrrrrr!

307
00:23:09,263 --> 00:23:12,784
Grrrrrr!

308
00:23:16,694 --> 00:23:20,346
Fire! Aghhhhhh! Fire!

309
00:23:26,842 --> 00:23:30,119
It won't open! They've sealed us in.
Oh, my lady! Look.

310
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:32,236
They'll never let us out.

311
00:23:32,276 --> 00:23:33,916
They mean for us to die!

312
00:23:33,956 --> 00:23:37,750
Don't say that, Flora.
All right, men, we should
retreat upstairs. Come.

313
00:23:37,790 --> 00:23:38,750
I'll not retreat.

314
00:23:38,790 --> 00:23:44,823
There's no creature on God's Earth
could survive such an assault.
I'm telling you, come upstairs!

315
00:23:44,863 --> 00:23:49,988
I'm telling you, sir, I will sleep
well tonight with that thing's
hide upon my wall.

316
00:23:55,214 --> 00:23:57,289
It must have crawled away to die. . .

317
00:23:57,329 --> 00:23:58,608
Grrrrrrr! Aghhhhhh!

318
00:23:59,329 --> 00:24:01,446
There's nothing we can do.

319
00:24:01,486 --> 00:24:07,919
Grrrrrrr! Stop!
GUNSHOTS

320
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:11,932
Did they kill it?

321
00:24:18,351 --> 00:24:20,946
Grrrrr! Grrrrr!

322
00:24:20,986 --> 00:24:25,007
Grrrrr! Grrrrr!

323
00:24:47,595 --> 00:24:49,476
Your Majesty? Your Majesty!

324
00:24:49,516 --> 00:24:52,112
Sir Robert? What's happening?

325
00:24:52,152 --> 00:24:54,030
I heard such terrible noises.

326
00:24:54,070 --> 00:24:55,707
Your Majesty, we've got to go.

327
00:24:55,747 --> 00:24:59,107
But what of Father Angelo,
is he still here?

328
00:24:59,147 --> 00:25:03,060
Captain Reynolds disposed of him.
The front door's no good,
it's blocked.

329
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:05,073
You'll have to leg it
out of a window.

330
00:25:11,051 --> 00:25:15,365
Excuse my manners, ma'am,
but I shall go first,
the better to assist Her Majesty.

331
00:25:15,405 --> 00:25:18,072
A noble sentiment.
Any chance you can hurry?

332
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:23,189
BANG! BANG! BANG!

333
00:25:25,837 --> 00:25:27,437
They want us to stay inside.

334
00:25:27,477 --> 00:25:30,712
Do they know who I am?
Yeah! That's why they want you.

335
00:25:30,752 --> 00:25:33,748
The wolf's lined you
up for. . .a biting.

336
00:25:33,788 --> 00:25:35,468
Now stop this talk.

337
00:25:35,508 --> 00:25:37,265
There can't be an actual wolf.

338
00:25:37,305 --> 00:25:40,826
WOLF HOWLS

339
00:25:43,299 --> 00:25:46,732
What do we do? We. . . run.
BANGING ON DOOR

340
00:25:46,772 --> 00:25:49,210
Is that it? Got any silver bullets?
Not on me, no.

341
00:25:49,250 --> 00:25:53,965
There we are, we run.
Your Majesty, I recommend a
vigorous jog. Good for the health.

342
00:26:00,442 --> 00:26:03,104
Grrrrr! Grrrrr!

343
00:26:10,870 --> 00:26:12,947
Come on! Come on!

344
00:26:12,987 --> 00:26:18,271
Grrrrr! Grrrrr!

345
00:26:27,568 --> 00:26:29,206
BANG!
Aghhhhh!

346
00:26:29,927 --> 00:26:32,243
I'll take this position and hold it.

347
00:26:32,283 --> 00:26:34,483
You keep moving, for God's sake.

348
00:26:34,523 --> 00:26:37,360
Your Majesty, I went to look for
the property, it was taken.

349
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:40,157
The chest was empty.
I have it, it's safe.

350
00:26:40,197 --> 00:26:42,234
Then remove yourself, ma'am.

351
00:26:42,274 --> 00:26:45,311
Doctor, you stand as
Her Majesty's protector.

352
00:26:45,351 --> 00:26:47,069
And you, Sir Robert,

353
00:26:47,109 --> 00:26:49,629
you're a traitor to the Crown.

354
00:26:49,669 --> 00:26:51,149
Bullets can't stop it.

355
00:26:51,189 --> 00:26:53,606
They'll buy you time. Now run!

356
00:27:03,531 --> 00:27:09,060
BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG!

357
00:27:11,012 --> 00:27:16,478
Aghhhh! Aghhhh! Aghhhh!

358
00:27:16,518 --> 00:27:17,991
Barricade the door.

359
00:27:25,711 --> 00:27:27,551
Wait a minute, shh, wait.

360
00:27:27,591 --> 00:27:30,074
WOLF HOWLS

361
00:27:30,114 --> 00:27:31,189
It's stopped.

362
00:27:38,252 --> 00:27:40,300
Grrrrr!

363
00:27:42,369 --> 00:27:47,366
Grrrrrrrrr!

364
00:27:47,406 --> 00:27:49,459
It's gone.

365
00:27:50,959 --> 00:27:52,483
Listen. . .

366
00:27:54,517 --> 00:27:56,610
WOLF'S FOO TSTEPS THUD

367
00:28:00,510 --> 00:28:02,909
(Is this the only door? )

368
00:28:02,949 --> 00:28:06,235
Yes, sir. No! Grrrrrrr!

369
00:28:06,275 --> 00:28:11,222
Grrrrrr! Grrrrrr! Grrrrrr!

370
00:28:11,262 --> 00:28:14,294
Shhhhhh!

371
00:28:18,329 --> 00:28:19,933
DOOR CREAKS

372
00:28:28,201 --> 00:28:32,035
Grrrrrr! Grrrrrr!

373
00:28:32,075 --> 00:28:33,674
I don't understand.

374
00:28:33,714 --> 00:28:35,403
What's stopping it?

375
00:28:38,513 --> 00:28:40,811
Something inside this room.

376
00:28:42,350 --> 00:28:45,304
What is it? Why can't it get in?

377
00:28:45,344 --> 00:28:47,751
Tell you what, though. What?

378
00:28:47,791 --> 00:28:49,311
Werewolf.

379
00:28:49,351 --> 00:28:52,781
I know! Uh!

380
00:28:52,821 --> 00:28:54,972
You all right? I'm OK, yeah.

381
00:28:55,012 --> 00:28:57,020
I'm sorry, ma'am.

382
00:28:58,975 --> 00:29:01,445
It's all my fault.

383
00:29:01,485 --> 00:29:03,572
I should have sent you away.

384
00:29:05,049 --> 00:29:07,560
I tried to suggest
something was wrong.

385
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:09,717
I thought you might notice.

386
00:29:09,757 --> 00:29:13,033
Was there nothing strange
about my household staff?

387
00:29:13,073 --> 00:29:14,393
They were bald, athletic.

388
00:29:14,433 --> 00:29:17,590
Your wife's away,
I thought you were happy.

389
00:29:18,588 --> 00:29:22,505
I tell you what, ma'am.
I bet you're not amused now.
Do you think this funny?

390
00:29:22,545 --> 00:29:24,621
No, I'm sorry.

391
00:29:24,661 --> 00:29:30,773
What, exactly, I pray, tell me
someone, please, what, exactly,
is that creature?

392
00:29:30,813 --> 00:29:34,976
You'd call it a werewolf,
but it's more of a lupine
wavelength "haemovariform".

393
00:29:35,016 --> 00:29:39,203
Should I trust you, sir? You, who
change your voice so easily?

394
00:29:39,243 --> 00:29:40,810
What happened to your accent?

395
00:29:40,850 --> 00:29:43,281
Oh, right, sorry. . .

396
00:29:43,321 --> 00:29:44,917
I'll not have it.

397
00:29:44,957 --> 00:29:49,876
No, sir, not you,
not that thing, none of it.

398
00:29:49,916 --> 00:29:53,152
This is not my world.

399
00:29:57,186 --> 00:30:03,059
Mistletoe! They're all garlanded
in mistletoe, and the wolf
doesn't attack them.

400
00:30:03,099 --> 00:30:07,215
Who brought this into the kitchen?
Must have been the Brethren.

401
00:30:07,255 --> 00:30:09,131
Gather it up. Quickly!

402
00:30:09,171 --> 00:30:11,361
Every last scrap. Quick, now!

403
00:30:16,445 --> 00:30:18,049
Mistletoe.

404
00:30:19,002 --> 00:30:20,845
Did your father put that there?

405
00:30:22,319 --> 00:30:23,836
I don't know. I suppose.

406
00:30:23,876 --> 00:30:28,275
On the other door too, though
a carving wouldn't be enough.

407
00:30:28,315 --> 00:30:30,243
I wonder. . .

408
00:30:30,991 --> 00:30:36,625
Viscum album. The oil of the
mistletoe, it's been worked
into the wood like a varnish.

409
00:30:36,665 --> 00:30:38,425
How clever was your dad? I love him !

410
00:30:38,465 --> 00:30:41,775
Powerful stuff, mistletoe,
bursting with viscotoxins.

411
00:30:41,815 --> 00:30:44,373
And the wolf's allergic to it?
Or it thinks it is.

412
00:30:44,413 --> 00:30:47,213
Maybe it's the way the monks
control the wolf.

413
00:30:47,253 --> 00:30:52,692
Nevertheless, that creature won't
give up, Doctor. And we still
don't possess an actual weapon.

414
00:30:52,732 --> 00:30:55,564
Your father got all the brains.
Being rude again?

415
00:30:55,604 --> 00:30:58,081
Good, I meant that one.
You want weapons?

416
00:30:58,121 --> 00:31:00,318
We're in a library. Books!

417
00:31:00,358 --> 00:31:02,835
Best weapons in the world.

418
00:31:02,875 --> 00:31:08,899
This room's the greatest arsenal
we could have. Arm yourself!

419
00:31:11,954 --> 00:31:15,584
There's no sound of the wolf,
my lady. Perhaps it's gone.

420
00:31:15,624 --> 00:31:17,868
And perhaps it's toying with us.

421
00:31:17,908 --> 00:31:22,817
My husband's up there,
if there's any chance he's still
alive, then by God, I'll assist him.

422
00:31:27,687 --> 00:31:32,003
Look up biology, zoology.
There might be something on wolves. . .
What about this?

423
00:31:32,043 --> 00:31:33,963
A book on mistletoe!
We need magic.

424
00:31:34,003 --> 00:31:35,559
If we could make explosives. . .

425
00:31:35,599 --> 00:31:37,439
That's the sort
of thing. Ooh!

426
00:31:37,479 --> 00:31:41,162
Look what your old dad found.

427
00:31:41,202 --> 00:31:43,234
Something fell to Earth.

428
00:31:43,274 --> 00:31:45,230
A spaceship? Shooting star.

429
00:31:45,270 --> 00:31:52,869
"In the year of our Lord 1540,
under the reign of King James V, an
almighty fire did burn in the pit. "

430
00:31:52,909 --> 00:31:55,702
That's the Glen of Saint
Catherine, by the monastery.

431
00:31:55,742 --> 00:31:58,456
That's 300 years ago.
What's it been waiting for?

432
00:31:58,496 --> 00:32:00,092
Maybe a single cell survived.

433
00:32:00,132 --> 00:32:03,130
Adapting slowly, down the
generations, it survived,

434
00:32:03,170 --> 00:32:06,334
through the humans,
host after host after host.

435
00:32:06,374 --> 00:32:07,964
Why does it want the throne?

436
00:32:08,004 --> 00:32:09,884
That's what it wants, it said so.

437
00:32:09,924 --> 00:32:12,801
The Empire of the Wolf. Imagine it.

438
00:32:12,841 --> 00:32:16,038
The Victorian age, accelerated -

439
00:32:16,078 --> 00:32:20,952
starships and missiles fuelled
by coal and driven by steam. . .

440
00:32:20,992 --> 00:32:24,237
leaving history devastated
in its wake.

441
00:32:24,277 --> 00:32:25,986
Sir Robert,

442
00:32:26,026 --> 00:32:27,906
if I am to die here. . .

443
00:32:27,946 --> 00:32:30,183
Don't say that, Your Majesty.

444
00:32:30,223 --> 00:32:34,538
I would destroy myself, rather
than let that creature infect me.

445
00:32:34,578 --> 00:32:37,972
But that's no matter. I ask only
that you might find some place of

446
00:32:38,012 --> 00:32:42,288
safekeeping for something far
older and more precious than myself.

447
00:32:42,328 --> 00:32:44,525
Hardly time to worry about
your valuables.

448
00:32:44,565 --> 00:32:47,005
Thank you for your opinion.

449
00:32:47,045 --> 00:32:50,083
But there is nothing
more valuable than this.

450
00:32:50,123 --> 00:32:52,880
Oh, Your Majesty.

451
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:58,393
Is that the Koh-i-Noor? Oh, yes.

452
00:32:58,433 --> 00:33:01,591
The greatest diamond in the world.

453
00:33:01,631 --> 00:33:03,764
Given to me as the spoils of war.

454
00:33:04,827 --> 00:33:07,105
Perhaps its legend
is now coming true.

455
00:33:07,145 --> 00:33:10,341
It is said that whoever owns it
must surely die.

456
00:33:10,381 --> 00:33:13,253
That's true of anything,
if you wait long enough. Can I?

457
00:33:21,767 --> 00:33:24,724
That is so beautiful.
How much is that worth?

458
00:33:24,764 --> 00:33:30,286
They say, the wages of the
entire planet, for a whole week.

459
00:33:30,326 --> 00:33:33,756
My mum'd be fighting the wolf off
with her bare hands for that thing.

460
00:33:33,796 --> 00:33:37,549
And she'd win. Where is the wolf?

461
00:33:37,589 --> 00:33:41,109
I don't trust this silence.
Why d'you travel with it?

462
00:33:41,149 --> 00:33:42,946
My annual pilgrimage.

463
00:33:42,986 --> 00:33:45,383
I'm taking it to Hellier and Carew,

464
00:33:45,423 --> 00:33:48,024
the royal jewellers, at Hazlehead.

465
00:33:48,064 --> 00:33:50,014
The stone needs recutting.

466
00:33:50,054 --> 00:33:52,654
But it's perfect.

467
00:33:52,694 --> 00:33:55,331
My late husband never thought so.
There's a fact.

468
00:33:55,371 --> 00:33:57,888
Prince Albert kept on
having it cut down.

469
00:33:57,928 --> 00:33:59,608
Used to be 40% bigger than this.

470
00:33:59,648 --> 00:34:01,245
But he was never happy.

471
00:34:01,285 --> 00:34:03,682
Kept on cutting and cutting.

472
00:34:03,722 --> 00:34:07,279
He always said the shine
was not quite right.

473
00:34:07,319 --> 00:34:12,319
But he died with it
still unfinished.

474
00:34:13,401 --> 00:34:14,914
Unfinished. . .

475
00:34:17,593 --> 00:34:20,665
Oh, yes! There's a lot of
unfinished business here.

476
00:34:20,705 --> 00:34:24,348
His father's research. . .
and your husband, ma'am,
he came here.

477
00:34:24,388 --> 00:34:29,256
Hold on, all these separate things,
they're not separate at all,
they're connected. My head!

478
00:34:29,296 --> 00:34:31,853
This house, it's a trap
for you, is that right?

479
00:34:31,893 --> 00:34:34,050
Obviously. That's what
the wolf intended.

480
00:34:34,090 --> 00:34:36,286
But what if there's
a trap inside the trap?

481
00:34:36,326 --> 00:34:40,804
Explain. What if his father and your
husband weren't just telling
each other stories?

482
00:34:40,844 --> 00:34:46,663
They dared to imagine all this was
true. Laying the real trap,
not for you, but for the wolf.

483
00:34:51,192 --> 00:34:53,205
Grrrrr! Grrrrr!

484
00:34:54,394 --> 00:34:56,266
That wolf there.

485
00:34:56,306 --> 00:34:59,827
GLASS CRACKS
Out! Out! Out! Out!

486
00:35:04,377 --> 00:35:06,140
Grrrrrr!

487
00:35:08,851 --> 00:35:10,580
Gotta get to the observatory!

488
00:35:11,648 --> 00:35:14,765
Grrrrrr! Grrrrrr!
Aghhhhhh! !

489
00:35:14,805 --> 00:35:18,488
Aghhhhhh! Grrrr!

490
00:35:18,528 --> 00:35:21,440
Good shot!
It was mistletoe.

491
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:25,357
Isobel. . . Now get back downstairs.

492
00:35:25,397 --> 00:35:26,792
Keep yourself safe.

493
00:35:26,832 --> 00:35:30,673
My love. Now go.

494
00:35:30,713 --> 00:35:32,193
Girls, come with me.

495
00:35:32,233 --> 00:35:34,868
Down the back stairs
back to the kitchens.

496
00:35:34,908 --> 00:35:38,144
Come on. The observatory's this way.

497
00:35:49,334 --> 00:35:52,286
No mistletoe here, cos your father
wanted the wolf inside.

498
00:35:52,326 --> 00:35:54,284
Is there any way of
barricading this?

499
00:35:54,324 --> 00:35:55,961
Do your work, and I'll defend it.

500
00:35:56,001 --> 00:35:57,521
If we could bind them shut. . .

501
00:35:57,561 --> 00:36:00,003
I said, I'll find you time, sir.

502
00:36:00,043 --> 00:36:01,563
Now get inside.

503
00:36:01,603 --> 00:36:03,315
Good man.

504
00:36:03,355 --> 00:36:06,077
Your Majesty, the diamond.

505
00:36:06,117 --> 00:36:08,789
For what purpose? The purpose
it was designed for.

506
00:36:08,829 --> 00:36:11,781
WOLF GROWLS

507
00:36:18,977 --> 00:36:20,126
Rose. . .

508
00:36:22,374 --> 00:36:24,891
Lift it. Come on.

509
00:36:24,931 --> 00:36:28,368
It's not the right time
for stargazing. . .

510
00:36:28,408 --> 00:36:30,131
Oh, yes, it is. . .

511
00:36:35,083 --> 00:36:38,359
Grrrrr! Grrrrr! Grrrrr!

512
00:36:40,236 --> 00:36:43,148
I committed treason for you.

513
00:36:43,993 --> 00:36:46,030
But now my wife

514
00:36:46,070 --> 00:36:48,027
will remember me with honour.

515
00:36:48,067 --> 00:36:51,918
Grrrrr! Grrrrr! Aghhhhhh!

516
00:37:01,253 --> 00:37:04,815
Thought you said this doesn't work.
It doesn't work as a telescope.

517
00:37:04,855 --> 00:37:07,087
It's a light chamber. . .
it's like a weapon.

518
00:37:07,127 --> 00:37:10,898
We've just got to power it up.
With what? There's no electricity.

519
00:37:12,486 --> 00:37:16,517
Moonlight? But the wolf needs
moonlight, it's made by moonlight.

520
00:37:16,557 --> 00:37:19,463
You're 70% water - you can
still drown. Come on!

521
00:37:24,193 --> 00:37:25,433
Come on!

522
00:37:38,015 --> 00:37:42,349
Grrrrrr! Grrrrrr!

523
00:38:04,389 --> 00:38:06,100
Make it brighter.

524
00:38:06,140 --> 00:38:07,624
Let me go.

525
00:38:28,401 --> 00:38:31,677
WOLF HOWLS

526
00:38:44,543 --> 00:38:46,661
Your Majesty?

527
00:38:46,701 --> 00:38:49,217
Did it bite you?

528
00:38:49,257 --> 00:38:53,278
No, it's. . . it's a cut, that's all.

529
00:38:54,692 --> 00:38:57,327
If that thing bit you. . .

530
00:38:57,367 --> 00:39:01,184
It was a splinter of wood when
the door came apart. It's nothing.

531
00:39:03,522 --> 00:39:05,205
Let me see. It is nothing.

532
00:39:14,110 --> 00:39:19,559
By the power invested in me
by the Church and the state,
I dub thee Sir Doctor of Tardis.

533
00:39:21,981 --> 00:39:25,935
By the power invested in me by the
Church and the state, I dub thee

534
00:39:25,975 --> 00:39:29,611
Dame Rose of the Powell Estate.

535
00:39:29,651 --> 00:39:31,970
You may stand.

536
00:39:32,010 --> 00:39:35,373
Many thanks, ma'am. They're never
gonna believe this back home.

537
00:39:35,413 --> 00:39:40,843
Your Majesty, you said last
night about receiving no
message from the great beyond.

538
00:39:40,883 --> 00:39:44,401
I think your husband cut
that diamond to save your life.

539
00:39:44,441 --> 00:39:47,040
He's protecting you even now, ma'am,

540
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:49,235
from beyond the grave. Indeed.

541
00:39:49,275 --> 00:39:54,869
Then you may think on
this also, that I am not amused.

542
00:39:54,909 --> 00:39:56,429
Yes!

543
00:39:56,469 --> 00:40:00,419
Not remotely amused.

544
00:40:00,459 --> 00:40:04,259
And henceforth, I banish you.

545
00:40:04,299 --> 00:40:06,014
I'm sorry?

546
00:40:06,054 --> 00:40:12,317
I have rewarded you, Sir
Doctor, and now you are exiled
from this empire, never to return.

547
00:40:14,286 --> 00:40:16,207
I don't know what you are,

548
00:40:16,247 --> 00:40:18,401
or where you're from

549
00:40:18,441 --> 00:40:23,242
but I know that you consort with
stars and magic, and think it fun.

550
00:40:23,282 --> 00:40:28,592
But your world is steeped in terror,
and blasphemy, and death,

551
00:40:28,632 --> 00:40:30,552
and I will not allow it.

552
00:40:30,592 --> 00:40:33,427
You will leave these shores.

553
00:40:33,467 --> 00:40:40,178
And you will reflect, I hope,
on how you came to stray so far
from all that is good,

554
00:40:40,218 --> 00:40:43,864
and how much longer you may survive
this terrible life.

555
00:40:47,295 --> 00:40:49,810
Now leave my world.

556
00:40:49,850 --> 00:40:53,329
And never return.

557
00:40:53,369 --> 00:40:55,324
Whoa.

558
00:40:55,364 --> 00:40:56,837
Cheers, Dougal!

559
00:40:58,719 --> 00:41:02,874
The funny thing is, Queen Victoria
actually did suffer a mutation
of the blood,

560
00:41:02,914 --> 00:41:04,034
it's historical fact.

561
00:41:04,074 --> 00:41:05,951
She was haemophiliac.

562
00:41:05,991 --> 00:41:08,228
But it's always been a mystery.

563
00:41:08,268 --> 00:41:10,671
She didn't inherit it,
it came from nowhere.

564
00:41:10,711 --> 00:41:12,351
You're saying that's a wolf bite?

565
00:41:12,391 --> 00:41:15,420
Well, maybe haemophilia's
just a Victorian euphemism.

566
00:41:15,460 --> 00:41:17,537
For werewolf? Could be.

567
00:41:17,577 --> 00:41:19,417
Queen Victoria's a werewolf?

568
00:41:19,457 --> 00:41:22,013
Could be. And her children
had the disease.

569
00:41:22,053 --> 00:41:24,250
Maybe she gave them a quick nip.

570
00:41:24,290 --> 00:41:26,609
So the Royal Family are werewolves?

571
00:41:26,649 --> 00:41:31,686
Well, maybe not yet.
A single wolf cell could take
a hundred years to mature.

572
00:41:31,726 --> 00:41:33,764
Might be ready by, ooh. . .

573
00:41:33,804 --> 00:41:35,404
early 21st century.

574
00:41:35,444 --> 00:41:37,679
Nah, that's just ridiculous.

575
00:41:37,719 --> 00:41:41,358
Mind you. Princess Anne. . .
I'll say no more.

576
00:41:41,398 --> 00:41:43,434
And if you think about it,

577
00:41:43,474 --> 00:41:45,189
they're very private.

578
00:41:45,229 --> 00:41:47,028
They plan everything in advance.

579
00:41:47,068 --> 00:41:50,225
They could schedule themselves
around the Moon!

580
00:41:50,265 --> 00:41:52,943
And. . .they like hunting.

581
00:41:52,983 --> 00:41:55,219
They love blood sports.

582
00:41:55,259 --> 00:41:58,415
Oh, my God! They're werewolves!

583
00:41:58,455 --> 00:42:00,588
THEY BOTH HOWL

584
00:42:07,208 --> 00:42:09,283
What will you do,
will you stay here?

585
00:42:09,323 --> 00:42:11,376
I don't think I could.

586
00:42:12,961 --> 00:42:15,157
I'd sell it.

587
00:42:15,197 --> 00:42:16,875
Or pull this place down.

588
00:42:20,990 --> 00:42:25,786
Although we may not speak
of these events in public,
they will not be forgotten.

589
00:42:25,826 --> 00:42:27,825
I promise you that.

590
00:42:27,865 --> 00:42:30,820
Your husband's sacrifice,

591
00:42:30,860 --> 00:42:32,856
the ingenuity of his father,

592
00:42:32,896 --> 00:42:36,334
they will live on. But how?

593
00:42:36,374 --> 00:42:41,807
I saw last night that Great Britain
has enemies beyond imagination.

594
00:42:41,847 --> 00:42:45,083
And we must defend our
borders on all sides.

595
00:42:46,525 --> 00:42:49,799
I propose. . .an institute,

596
00:42:49,839 --> 00:42:54,555
to investigate these strange
happenings, and to fight them.

597
00:42:54,595 --> 00:42:57,113
I would call it Torchwood.

598
00:42:57,153 --> 00:42:59,990
The Torchwood Institute.

599
00:43:00,030 --> 00:43:04,267
And if this Doctor should return,
then he should beware.

600
00:43:04,307 --> 00:43:07,464
Because Torchwood will be waiting.

601
00:43:12,495 --> 00:43:15,282
Good morning, class.
Are we sitting comfortably?

602
00:43:16,889 --> 00:43:19,651
It turns out all the kitchen
staff were replaced.

603
00:43:19,691 --> 00:43:21,251
There's something going on.

604
00:43:21,291 --> 00:43:24,564
May I introduce Miss Sarah-Jane
Smith? Nice to meet you.

605
00:43:24,604 --> 00:43:26,360
Nice to meet you! Yes, very nice!

606
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:29,756
You were not permitted to leave
your station during a sitting.

607
00:43:29,796 --> 00:43:32,715
Boy in class, got a knowledge
way beyond Earth.

608
00:43:32,755 --> 00:43:33,750
Squawkkkkkkkkk!

609
00:43:34,475 --> 00:43:38,309
K-9! Our time has come, my brothers.

610
00:43:38,349 --> 00:43:40,527
Today we shall become gods.

611
00:43:41,662 --> 00:43:45,549
