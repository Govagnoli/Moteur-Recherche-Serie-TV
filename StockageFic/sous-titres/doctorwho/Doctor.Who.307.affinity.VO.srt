1
00:00:08,870 --> 00:00:11,090
There we go! Universal roaming.

2
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:15,130
Never have to worry
about a signal again.

3
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:17,430
No way! It's too mad.

4
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:21,080
So I can phone anyone, anywhere
in space and time on my mobile?

5
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:23,460
Long as you know the area code.

6
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:25,300
Frequent flyer's privilege.

7
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:29,410
Go on, try it.

8
00:00:32,410 --> 00:00:35,480
Distress signal! Locking on,
might be a bit of...

9
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:40,660
..turbulence. Sorry!

10
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:43,930
Come on, Martha, let's take a look.

11
00:00:43,930 --> 00:00:47,270
'Automated distress signal
transmitting.' Woh! Now that is hot!

12
00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:50,650
'Automated distress
signal transmitting.'
It's like a sauna in here!

13
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:52,760
Venting systems.

14
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:56,210
Working at full pelt,
trying to cool down...

15
00:00:56,210 --> 00:00:58,130
wherever it is we are.

16
00:00:58,130 --> 00:01:01,590
Well! If you can't stand the heat...

17
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:05,810
That's better! Oi, you two!

18
00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:07,930
Get out of there.
Seal that door! Now!

19
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:13,690
Who are you? What're you doing
on my ship? Are you police?

20
00:01:13,690 --> 00:01:16,180
Why would we be police?
We got your distress signal.

21
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:19,830
If this is a ship,
why can't I hear any engines?
It went dead four minutes ago.

22
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:24,250
So maybe we should stop chatting
and get to engineering. Captain.
'Secure closure active.'

23
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:27,890
What? This ship's gone mad.

24
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:32,310
Who activated secure closure?
I nearly got locked into Area 27!

25
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:38,650
Who are you? He's the Doctor
and I'm Martha. Hello.

26
00:01:38,650 --> 00:01:42,870
'Impact projection
42 minutes, 27 seconds.'

27
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:47,290
We'll get out of this. I promise.
Doctor! 42 minutes until what?

28
00:01:47,290 --> 00:01:49,590
Doctor!

29
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:51,130
Look.

30
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:56,310
42 minutes
until we crash into the sun.

31
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:01,590
How many crew members on board?
Seven, including us.

32
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:04,660
We transport cargo across the galaxy.
Everything's automated.

33
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:07,810
Call the others. I'll get you out.
What's he doing?! Doctor, don't!

34
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:09,650
AAAGH!

35
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:13,110
But my ship's in there!

36
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:17,910
In the vent chamber?!
It's our lifeboat! It's lava.

37
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:22,790
The temperature's going mad in there.
Up 3,000 degrees in ten
seconds and still rising.

38
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:27,320
Channelling the air. The closer we
get to the sun, the hotter that
room'll get. We're stuck here.

39
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:30,580
So, we fix the engines, we steer
the ship away from the sun. Simple!

40
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:35,770
Engineering down here, is it?
'Impact in 40.26.'

41
00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:39,030
Blimey! D'you always leave things
in such a mess? Oh, my God.

42
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:41,220
What happened?

43
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:46,520
It's wrecked!
Pretty efficiently, too.
Someone knew what they were doing.

44
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:49,400
Where's Korwin?
Anyone heard from him or Ashton?

45
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:52,660
No. D'you mean someone
did this on purpose?

46
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:55,730
Korwin, Ashton, where are you?

47
00:03:55,730 --> 00:03:59,270
Korwin, can you answer?!

48
00:03:59,270 --> 00:04:01,110
He should be up here!

49
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:05,720
Oh, we're in the
Torajii system, lovely!

50
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:08,490
You're a long way from home, Martha.
Half a universe away.

51
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:12,820
Yeah, feels it. And you're still
using energy scoops for fusion!

52
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:15,320
Hasn't that been outlawed yet?

53
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:17,620
We're due to upgrade next docking.

54
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:20,120
Scannell, engine report!

55
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:28,150
No response.
What?

56
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:35,290
The controls are wrecked,
I can't get them back online.

57
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:39,130
Oh, come on! Auxiliary engines!
Every craft's got auxiliaries!

58
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:42,770
We don't have access from here.
The auxiliary controls are
in the front of the ship.

59
00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:46,890
With 29 password-sealed doors
between us and them.
We'll never get there on time.

60
00:04:46,890 --> 00:04:51,990
Can't you override the doors?
No, sealed closure means what it says.
They're all deadlock sealed.

61
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:56,870
So a sonic screwdriver's no use.
Nothing's any use! We've got no
engines, no time and no chance.

62
00:04:56,870 --> 00:05:00,250
Oh, listen to you,
defeated before you've even started!

63
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:03,010
Where's your Dunkirk spirit?
Who's got the door passwords?

64
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:05,620
They're randomly generated.
Reckon I'd know most of them.

65
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:08,500
Sorry, Riley Vashtee. What're you
waiting for, Riley Vashtee?

66
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:14,260
It's a two person job.
One to take this for the questions,
the other to carry this.

67
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:19,060
The oldest and cheapest security
system around. Reliable and simple.
Just like you, Riley.

68
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:23,480
Try to be helpful, get abuse. Nice.
I'll help you. Make myself useful.

69
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:29,240
It's remotely controlled
by the computer panel. That's why
it needs two. Oi, be careful.

70
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:31,730
You too.

71
00:05:31,730 --> 00:05:33,650
'McDonnell, it's Ashton.'

72
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:37,300
Where are you? Is Korwin with you?
'Get up to the Medcentre, now!'

73
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:53,810
You've gotta stop it!

74
00:05:53,810 --> 00:05:58,040
Korwin, it's Abi, open your eyes,
I need to take a look at you.

75
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:02,650
Korwin! What's happened? Is he OK?
Kath! Help me! It's burning me!

76
00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:07,450
How long's he been like this?
Ashton just brought him in. What are
you doing?! Don't get too close.

77
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:11,670
He's my husband! And he's
just sabotaged our ship!

78
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:13,970
What? He went mad.

79
00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:17,620
He locked the ship, then sent a heat
pulse to melt the controls.

80
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:20,120
He wouldn't do that!
I saw it happen, Captain.

81
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:22,610
Korwin? Korwin, open
your eyes for me a second?

82
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:24,530
I can't.
Yeah, course you can. Go on.

83
00:06:24,530 --> 00:06:26,840
Don't make me look at you. Please.

84
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:28,450
All right, all right just relax.

85
00:06:28,450 --> 00:06:29,910
Sedative?

86
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:35,480
What's wrong with him?

87
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:38,930
Rising body temperature,
unusual energy readings.

88
00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:44,500
I do love a good stasis chamber!
Keep him sedated in there,
regulate the body temperature.

89
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:48,150
And run a bio-scan, a tissue profile
and a metabolic detail.

90
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:51,410
Just doing them now.
Ooh, you're good!

91
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:55,830
Anyone else presenting these
symptoms? Not so far.
That's something!

92
00:06:55,830 --> 00:07:00,630
What's the matter with him?
Some sort of infection.
We'll get the test results.

93
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:06,850
Now, back downstairs, eh, see
about those engines, go.

94
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:14,450
Call us if there's news.
Any questions? Yeah. Who are you?

95
00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:16,370
I'm the Doctor!

96
00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:27,700
Heat shield failing at 25.

97
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:31,540
Impact in 32.50.

98
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:35,960
Hurry up, will you? All right!

99
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:40,070
Fix the clamp on.
What're you typing?

100
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:43,830
Each door's code is the answer to
a random question set by the crew.

101
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:46,900
Nine tours back,
we got drunk, thought them up.

102
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:50,740
If we're hijacked, we're the only
ones who know all the answers.

103
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:55,160
So you type in the right answer.
This sends an unlock pulse
to the clamp.

104
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:57,460
But we only get one chance per door.

105
00:07:57,460 --> 00:08:00,150
Get it wrong,
the whole system freezes.

106
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:05,530
Better not get it wrong then. OK!
Date of SS Pentallian's first
flight? That's all right! Go!

107
00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:11,290
Yes! 28 more to go!

108
00:08:13,010 --> 00:08:16,170
Abi, how's Korwin doing?
Any results from the bioscan?

109
00:08:16,170 --> 00:08:20,310
He's under heavy sedation. I'm just
trying to make sense of this data.

110
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:23,380
Give me a couple of minutes
and I'll let you know.

111
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:39,890
Martha, Riley! How you doing?
Area 29, at the door to 28.

112
00:08:39,890 --> 00:08:42,970
Yeah, you've gotta move faster!
We're doing our best!

113
00:08:42,970 --> 00:08:48,920
Find the next number in
the sequence. 313, 331, 367. What?!

114
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:50,450
You said the crew
knew all the answers!

115
00:08:50,450 --> 00:08:52,260
The crew's changed since
we set the questions.

116
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:54,370
You're joking. 379! What?

117
00:08:54,370 --> 00:08:56,600
It's a sequence of happy primes.
379!

118
00:08:56,600 --> 00:09:01,290
Happy what? Just enter it! Are you
sure? We only get one chance!

119
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:05,210
Any number that reduces to one
when you take the sum of
the squares of its digits,

120
00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:09,670
A happy prime is a number that's
both happy and prime.

121
00:09:05,210 --> 00:09:08,270
and continue iterating until it
yields one, is a happy number.
Any number that doesn't, isn't.

122
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:14,650
Now type it in! I dunno, talk about
dumbing down, don't they teach
recreational mathematics any more?

123
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:18,870
We're through!

124
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:21,750
Keep moving, fast as you can.

125
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:25,010
And Martha, be careful. There may be
something else on board the ship.

126
00:09:25,010 --> 00:09:28,280
Any time you wanna unnerve me,
feel free. Will do, thanks.

127
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:35,190
Impact in 30.50. Can't believe
our lives depend on some stupid
pub quiz. Is that the next one?

128
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:37,690
Ah, this is a nightmare.

129
00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:40,570
Classical music. Who had the
most predownload number ones?

130
00:09:40,570 --> 00:09:43,830
Elvis Presley? Or The Beatles?

131
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:45,750
How are we supposed to know that?

132
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:49,010
We need a back-up,
in case they don't reach
the auxiliary engines in time.

133
00:09:49,010 --> 00:09:51,010
What have we got? Doctor!

134
00:09:51,010 --> 00:09:54,660
What is it now? Who had the most
number ones, Elvis or the Beatles?

135
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:56,310
Pre-downloads? Elvis!

136
00:09:56,310 --> 00:09:57,850
No! The Beatles!

137
00:09:57,850 --> 00:09:59,380
No! Wait!

138
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:02,070
Erm, that remix?

139
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:06,370
I don't know! I am a bit busy!
All right! I'll ask someone else!

140
00:10:06,370 --> 00:10:09,170
Now, where was I?
Here Comes The Sun!

141
00:10:09,170 --> 00:10:14,360
No! Resources! So! The power's still
working, the generator's going,
if we could harness that. Ah!

142
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:20,580
Use the generators to jump start
the ship. Exactly! It'll buy some
more time. That is brilliant!

143
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:23,960
I know! See, tiny glimmer of hope!

144
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:27,610
If it works. Oh, believe me,
you're gonna make it work.

145
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:32,410
That told him!

146
00:10:32,410 --> 00:10:34,710
Impact in 29.46.

147
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:38,550
MOBILE RINGS

148
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:40,850
Hello? Mum! It's me!

149
00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:42,390
It's Martha! Wow!

150
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:46,310
Where are you? Don't you check
your messages? I've been calling you!

151
00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:49,880
Actually, bit busy, need you to do
something for me. No, listen to me.

152
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:54,490
We have to talk about this Doctor.
Not now. I need you to
look something up on the internet.

153
00:10:54,490 --> 00:10:57,370
Do it yourself! Oh, just DO IT!

154
00:11:03,890 --> 00:11:06,660
Please. When did you get so rude?

155
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:10,690
I'll tell you when -
ever since you met that man.

156
00:11:10,690 --> 00:11:16,180
I need to know who had more number
ones, the Beatles or Elvis.
Hang on, the mouse is unplugged.

157
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:22,330
OK, I'm on. What is this, a pub quiz?

158
00:11:22,330 --> 00:11:25,400
Yeah. Pub quiz.
Using your mobile is cheating.

159
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:29,240
Have you found it?
There's over 400,000 results.

160
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:31,050
Give me a minute!

161
00:11:31,050 --> 00:11:34,690
'Impact in 28.50.'

162
00:11:34,690 --> 00:11:38,260
Doctor, these readings are starting
to scare me. What d'you mean?

163
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:39,990
Korwin's body's changing.

164
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:43,450
His whole biological make-up,
it's impossible.

165
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:55,080
This is Medcentre, urgent assistance
requested, urgent assistance!

166
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:59,000
Stay here! Keep working!

167
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:04,370
Urgent assistance!

168
00:12:04,370 --> 00:12:07,030
Abi, they're on their way.

169
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:13,590
What's happening to you?
Burn with me.

170
00:12:13,590 --> 00:12:16,250
Burn with me. Captain!

171
00:12:18,010 --> 00:12:20,310
I told you to stay in engineering!

172
00:12:20,310 --> 00:12:24,150
I only take orders from one person.
Is he always this cheery?

173
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:26,340
Elvis! What?

174
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:28,760
Really? Elvis!

175
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:30,870
Burn with me.

176
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:32,790
Korwin, you're sick.

177
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:37,010
Burn...with...me!

178
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:42,770
Mum, you're a star!

179
00:12:42,770 --> 00:12:44,690
Now, we need to have a serious talk.

180
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:50,530
SCREAMING

181
00:12:52,570 --> 00:12:54,870
What was that?

182
00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:56,530
I've gotta go!

183
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:10,610
Doctor, what were those screams?
Concentrate on those doors!

184
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:16,370
Impact in 27.06.

185
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:23,290
Korwin's gone!

186
00:13:23,290 --> 00:13:25,480
Oh, my God...

187
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:34,010
Tell me that's not Lerner.

188
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:40,570
Endothermic vaporisation. Horrible.

189
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:42,870
I've never seen one this ferocious.

190
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:45,940
Burn with me.

191
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:49,210
That's what we heard Korwin say.
What?

192
00:13:49,210 --> 00:13:51,320
You think...?

193
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:54,970
No way! Scannell, tell him!
Korwin is not a killer.

194
00:13:54,970 --> 00:13:57,270
He can't vaporise people! He's human!

195
00:13:57,270 --> 00:13:59,190
His bio-scan results.

196
00:13:59,190 --> 00:14:03,410
Internal temperature 100 degrees,
body oxygen replaced by hydrogen.

197
00:14:03,410 --> 00:14:06,290
Your husband hasn't been infected.
He's been overwhelmed.

198
00:14:06,290 --> 00:14:10,330
The test results are wrong. What is
it? A parasite, mutagenic virus?

199
00:14:10,330 --> 00:14:13,590
Something that needs a host body,
but how did it get inside him?

200
00:14:13,590 --> 00:14:18,010
Stop talking like he's some kind of
experiment! Where's the ship
been recently?

201
00:14:18,010 --> 00:14:23,570
Docked with any other vessels?
Any sort of external contact?
Is this an interrogation?

202
00:14:23,570 --> 00:14:27,610
We've gotta stop him, before he
kills again. We're just a cargo ship

203
00:14:30,490 --> 00:14:33,370
Doctor, if you give her a minute.

204
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:39,700
I'm fine, I need to warn the crew.

205
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:43,620
Everybody, listen to me. Something
has infected Korwin.

206
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:46,040
We think...

207
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:50,260
..he killed Abi Lerner.

208
00:14:53,330 --> 00:14:56,410
None of you must go anywhere
near him. Is that clear?

209
00:14:57,940 --> 00:15:02,170
Understood, Captain. Erina,
get back here with that equipment.

210
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:06,390
Whatever you say, boss.

211
00:15:06,390 --> 00:15:11,380
Go there, come back,
fetch this, carry these, make drinks,

212
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:15,030
sweep up. please, kill me now!

213
00:15:17,330 --> 00:15:19,830
Burn with me.

214
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:25,210
Burn with me.

215
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:33,460
Impact in 24.51.

216
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:36,730
Is the infection permanent?
Can you cure him?

217
00:15:39,410 --> 00:15:42,870
I don't know.
Don't lie to me, Doctor.

218
00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:45,830
11 years, we've been married.

219
00:15:45,830 --> 00:15:49,010
Chose this ship together.

220
00:15:49,010 --> 00:15:54,390
He keeps me honest.
So I don't want false hope.

221
00:15:54,390 --> 00:15:57,460
The parasite's too aggressive.
Your husband's gone.

222
00:15:59,190 --> 00:16:00,730
There's no way back. I'm sorry.

223
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:05,530
Thank you.

224
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:10,330
Are you certain nothing
happened to provoke this?

225
00:16:10,330 --> 00:16:15,320
Nobody's working on anything secret?
Cos it's vital that you tell me.

226
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:17,700
I know every inch of this ship.

227
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:22,420
I know every detail of my
crew's lives. There is nothing.

228
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:26,070
Then why's this thing
so interested in you?

229
00:16:29,330 --> 00:16:30,680
I wish I knew.

230
00:16:39,890 --> 00:16:41,890
Doctor, we're through to Area 17.

231
00:16:41,890 --> 00:16:45,270
Keep going. You've got to get to
Area One and reboot those engines.

232
00:16:53,530 --> 00:16:56,020
You got those tools, Erina?
Cos I'm...

233
00:17:01,210 --> 00:17:04,660
Korwin, it's me...

234
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:07,730
we're mates. They're getting too far.

235
00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:09,650
We must share the light.

236
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:28,090
Heatshield failing at 20%.

237
00:17:28,090 --> 00:17:30,850
Come on!

238
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:32,890
Everything on this ship is so cheap!
CLANG!

239
00:17:32,890 --> 00:17:34,420
Who's there?

240
00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:47,670
Is that Korwin? No, wait a minute.

241
00:17:47,670 --> 00:17:49,780
Oh, Ashton. What're you doing?

242
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:52,850
Burn with me.

243
00:17:52,850 --> 00:17:58,500
Well, if you wanna help.
Burn with me. Burn with me.

244
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:01,690
Move! Come on!

245
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:25,190
What is happening on this ship?
Never mind that, where are we?

246
00:18:25,190 --> 00:18:26,840
Airlock sealed.

247
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:28,950
Jettison escape pod.

248
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:31,830
That doesn't mean us? Doctor!

249
00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:34,130
Pod jettison initiated.

250
00:18:34,130 --> 00:18:38,550
Doctor! We're stuck in an escape
pod off the Area 17 airlock!

251
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:44,770
One of the crew's trying to jettison
us! You've gotta help us!
Tell me you can stop it.

252
00:18:45,650 --> 00:18:49,960
Why's this happening? Stay here.
I mean it this time!

253
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:52,570
Jump start those engines!

254
00:18:59,170 --> 00:19:02,550
It's picking us off...

255
00:19:02,550 --> 00:19:04,550
one by one.

256
00:19:06,390 --> 00:19:08,690
Jettison held.

257
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:10,810
Thank you.

258
00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:17,140
Jettison reactivated.

259
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:21,170
Come on!

260
00:19:29,050 --> 00:19:31,730
Sierpinski sequence!
This'll get him.

261
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:38,340
Jettison held. Escape Pod stabilised.

262
00:19:39,990 --> 00:19:47,480
You're pretty good.

263
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:50,740
Ashton?

264
00:19:54,770 --> 00:19:58,040
Someone's hacked at the systems.

265
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:01,490
I can't re-route the generators.

266
00:20:01,490 --> 00:20:04,950
There's no way I'm gonna be
able to jumpstart this ship!

267
00:20:04,950 --> 00:20:07,610
Who the hell did that?!

268
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:11,670
Korwin?

269
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:16,280
What are you?

270
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:19,350
Why are you killing my crew?

271
00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:21,930
What did you do to him?

272
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:25,490
What have you done to my husband?

273
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:27,410
You recognise me.

274
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:32,020
Korwin, you know me!

275
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:35,290
It's Kath. Your wife.

276
00:20:35,290 --> 00:20:37,210
My wife.

277
00:20:37,210 --> 00:20:39,130
That's right!

278
00:20:39,130 --> 00:20:42,970
You're still in there! I'm your wife.

279
00:20:45,850 --> 00:20:48,730
It's your fault.

280
00:21:01,210 --> 00:21:03,700
That's enough!

281
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:08,500
What do you want? Why this ship?

282
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:11,960
Tell me! Jettison activated.

283
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:16,840
He's crashed the circuit,
I can't stop it. I can't stop it!

284
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:18,950
What d'you mean it's my fault?

285
00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:21,560
It's your fault.

286
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:24,050
Now burn with me.

287
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:31,730
What're you doing? Freezing him!
Ice vents! You'll kill him!

288
00:21:31,730 --> 00:21:33,850
Come on.

289
00:21:33,850 --> 00:21:36,920
Let's see you.

290
00:21:39,410 --> 00:21:41,910
I wanna know what you really are.

291
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:54,200
Airlock sealed.

292
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:03,690
McDonnell!
Ashton's heading in your direction.

293
00:22:03,690 --> 00:22:05,720
He's been infected just like Korwin.

294
00:22:09,170 --> 00:22:11,670
Korwin's dead, Doctor.

295
00:22:11,670 --> 00:22:13,970
Everything's locked!

296
00:22:13,970 --> 00:22:18,010
Airlock decompression completed.

297
00:22:18,010 --> 00:22:20,660
Jettisoning pod.

298
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:26,070
Doctor!

299
00:22:26,070 --> 00:22:29,330
I'll save you!

300
00:22:29,330 --> 00:22:31,250
Martha, it's too late.

301
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:32,980
Doctor!

302
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:34,900
I'll save you.

303
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:36,820
Doctor! I can't hear you.

304
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:38,480
INAUDIBLE

305
00:22:41,130 --> 00:22:42,890
INAUDIBLE

306
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:54,760
INAUDIBLE

307
00:23:03,130 --> 00:23:04,660
Sorry.

308
00:23:16,570 --> 00:23:18,870
Impact in 17.05.

309
00:23:26,170 --> 00:23:28,280
What did he mean, "your fault"?

310
00:23:31,050 --> 00:23:35,570
Don't touch him, he's infected!
We don't know how it spreads.

311
00:23:35,570 --> 00:23:38,450
You murdered him.
He was about to kill you.

312
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:42,870
He recognised me. You heard the
Doctor! It isn't Korwin any more.

313
00:23:42,870 --> 00:23:45,060
The Doctor doesn't know!
None of us know.

314
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:48,440
So what're you gonna do, sit here
until we burn? Cos without you,

315
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:50,740
none of us stand a chance
of getting out of here.

316
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:53,810
Scannell,
I need a spacesuit in Area 17, now!

317
00:23:53,810 --> 00:23:57,080
What for? Just get down here!

318
00:23:57,080 --> 00:24:00,340
Go on, do what he says.

319
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:02,840
Ashton's still out there.

320
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:05,800
I'll deal with him.

321
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:21,080
The wonderful world of space travel.

322
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:24,530
Prettier it looks,
the more likely it is to kill you.

323
00:24:24,530 --> 00:24:26,450
He'll come for us.

324
00:24:26,450 --> 00:24:28,180
It's too late.

325
00:24:28,180 --> 00:24:32,210
Our heat shields'll pack in any
minute. Then we go into freefall.

326
00:24:32,210 --> 00:24:36,250
We'll fall into the sun way before
he has a chance to do anything.

327
00:24:36,250 --> 00:24:38,930
You don't know the Doctor.

328
00:24:38,930 --> 00:24:40,850
I believe in him.

329
00:24:40,850 --> 00:24:45,080
Then you're lucky. I've never found
anyone worth believing in.

330
00:24:47,850 --> 00:24:50,070
No girlfriend?

331
00:24:50,070 --> 00:24:52,180
Boyfriend?

332
00:24:52,180 --> 00:24:58,330
The job doesn't lend itself to
stable relationships. Family, then?

333
00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:01,010
My dad's dead.

334
00:25:01,010 --> 00:25:04,470
I haven't seen my mum in six years.

335
00:25:04,470 --> 00:25:08,310
She didn't want me to
sign up for cargo tours.

336
00:25:08,310 --> 00:25:11,960
Things were said and, since then,

337
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:13,490
all silent.

338
00:25:15,030 --> 00:25:20,020
She wanted to hold on to me.
I know that. God, she's so stubborn.

339
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:22,130
Yeah, well. That's families.

340
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:26,170
What about you?

341
00:25:26,170 --> 00:25:28,090
Oh, the works.

342
00:25:28,090 --> 00:25:32,120
Mum, Dad, Dad's girlfriend,

343
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:35,000
brother, sister.

344
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,530
There's no silence there.

345
00:25:38,450 --> 00:25:39,990
So much noise!

346
00:25:42,290 --> 00:25:44,020
God!

347
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:46,330
They'll never know.

348
00:25:46,330 --> 00:25:48,440
I'll just have disappeared.

349
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:50,740
And they'll always be waiting.

350
00:25:52,470 --> 00:25:54,390
Call them.

351
00:25:58,420 --> 00:26:05,530
Ashton!

352
00:26:40,470 --> 00:26:42,390
I can't let you do this!

353
00:26:42,390 --> 00:26:44,310
You're wasting your breath,
Scannell. You're not gonna stop me.

354
00:26:44,310 --> 00:26:47,570
Open an airlock on a ship spinning
into the sun? You can't survive.

355
00:26:47,570 --> 00:26:51,800
Oh, just you watch! It's suicide.
This close to the sun, the
shields'll barely protect you.

356
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:54,870
If I can boost the magnetic lock,
it should remagnetise the pod.

357
00:26:54,870 --> 00:26:59,090
You've got to get the rest
of the doors open,
we need those auxiliary engines.

358
00:26:59,090 --> 00:27:03,130
Doctor! They're too far away. It's
too late. I'm not gonna lose her.

359
00:27:18,870 --> 00:27:20,980
Decompression initiated.

360
00:27:27,130 --> 00:27:29,430
Impact in 12.55.

361
00:27:29,430 --> 00:27:32,690
MOBILE RINGS
Hello?

362
00:27:32,690 --> 00:27:36,920
It's me again. Sorry about earlier.
Is everything all right?

363
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:40,180
Yeah, course.

364
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:41,990
Martha?

365
00:27:41,990 --> 00:27:43,640
Mum, I...

366
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:48,630
You know I love you, don't you?

367
00:27:48,630 --> 00:27:50,740
Of course I do.

368
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:54,200
What's brought this on?
I never say it.

369
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:57,650
Never get the time
or never think of it and then...

370
00:27:59,770 --> 00:28:02,840
I really love you.

371
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:06,280
Tell Dad, Leo and Tish
that I love them too.

372
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:08,980
Martha, what's wrong?

373
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:12,050
Nothing. Promise. Where are you?

374
00:28:12,050 --> 00:28:14,930
Just out. With anyone nice?

375
00:28:14,930 --> 00:28:16,660
Some mates.

376
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:18,580
What mates?

377
00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:20,500
Mum, can we not just talk?

378
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:24,530
Of course, what d'you want
to talk about?

379
00:28:24,530 --> 00:28:26,650
I dunno, anything.

380
00:28:26,650 --> 00:28:30,490
What you had for breakfast,
what you watched on telly,

381
00:28:30,490 --> 00:28:34,900
how much you're gonna kill Dad
when you see him. Just anything.

382
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:37,010
Is the Doctor with you?

383
00:28:37,010 --> 00:28:38,550
Is he there now?

384
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:40,090
Mum, just leave it.

385
00:28:40,090 --> 00:28:42,390
It's a simple enough question.

386
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:47,080
I'd better go.

387
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:49,650
No, Martha, wait.

388
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:51,920
See you, Mum.

389
00:29:06,390 --> 00:29:08,690
Impact in 11.15.

390
00:29:08,690 --> 00:29:11,380
Heat-shield failing at 10%.

391
00:29:46,330 --> 00:29:48,440
Come on!

392
00:29:53,050 --> 00:29:54,770
Go on, my son!

393
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:05,910
Doctor! How're you doing?
I can't get it! I can't reach!

394
00:30:05,910 --> 00:30:08,980
I dunno how much longer I can last!

395
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:11,290
Come on! Don't give up now.

396
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:49,690
We're being pulled back!
I told you! The Doctor!

397
00:31:06,390 --> 00:31:10,230
It's alive!

398
00:31:11,850 --> 00:31:14,260
It's alive!

399
00:31:14,260 --> 00:31:16,760
It's alive.

400
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:19,060
Doctor, close the airlock now!

401
00:31:19,060 --> 00:31:20,600
That pod's gonna smash into him!

402
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:23,480
Stay here.

403
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:26,550
Impact in 8.57.

404
00:31:28,930 --> 00:31:30,970
Airlock repressurisation completed.

405
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:39,800
Doctor! Doctor! Are you OK?

406
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:41,910
Stay away from me!

407
00:31:41,910 --> 00:31:43,830
What's happened?

408
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:49,090
It's your fault, Captain McDonnell!

409
00:31:49,090 --> 00:31:53,810
Riley, get down to Area 10 and help
Scannell with the doors. Go!

410
00:31:53,810 --> 00:31:59,190
You mined that sun,
scooped its surface for cheap fuel!

411
00:31:59,190 --> 00:32:01,110
You should've scanned for life!

412
00:32:01,110 --> 00:32:03,030
I don't understand.
Doctor, what're you talking about?

413
00:32:03,030 --> 00:32:05,140
That sun's alive!

414
00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:06,950
A living organism!

415
00:32:06,950 --> 00:32:10,710
They scooped out its heart, used
it for fuel and now it's screaming.

416
00:32:10,710 --> 00:32:15,890
What d'you mean? How can a sun
be alive, why's he saying that?
Because it's living in me!

417
00:32:15,890 --> 00:32:21,350
Oh, my God. Humans! You grab
whatever's nearest and bleed it dry!

418
00:32:21,350 --> 00:32:25,110
You should have scanned!
It takes too long, we'd be caught!

419
00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:29,720
Fusion scoops are illegal! Martha!
You've gotta freeze me! Quickly!
What?

420
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:32,020
Stasis chamber!

421
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:35,480
You've got to take me to below
minus 200, freeze it out of me.

422
00:32:39,510 --> 00:32:42,010
It'll use me
to kill you if you don't!

423
00:32:42,010 --> 00:32:44,890
The closer we get to the sun,
the stronger the link.

424
00:32:44,890 --> 00:32:47,570
Medcentre quickly! Quickly!

425
00:32:47,570 --> 00:32:49,300
Help me!

426
00:32:51,990 --> 00:32:54,290
Impact in 7.30.

427
00:33:15,030 --> 00:33:18,180
What's your favourite colour? You
what? It's the question! Purple!

428
00:33:20,870 --> 00:33:23,090
Or did I say orange? Come on!

429
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:28,660
I can do this, I can do it.

430
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:34,810
Martha! Where are you? It's all
right. Just setting everything up.

431
00:33:34,810 --> 00:33:36,730
Stasis chamber. Minus 200, yeah?

432
00:33:36,730 --> 00:33:41,140
You'll kill him! Nobody
can survive those temperatures.

433
00:33:41,140 --> 00:33:46,900
He's not human! If he says he can
survive, then he can. Let me help yo
then. You've done enough damage.

434
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:50,170
Ten seconds, that's all I'll be
able to take. No more.

435
00:33:50,170 --> 00:33:55,160
Martha? Yeah? It's burning me up,
I can't control it!

436
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:58,230
If you don't get rid of it,
I could kill you.

437
00:33:58,230 --> 00:34:01,880
I could kill you all.

438
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:03,800
I'm scared. I'm so scared.

439
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:05,910
Just stay calm. You saved me.

440
00:34:05,910 --> 00:34:08,210
Now I return the favour.

441
00:34:08,210 --> 00:34:12,250
Just believe in me. It's burning
through me, I dunno what'll happen.

442
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:15,130
That's enough. I've got you.

443
00:34:15,130 --> 00:34:20,310
There's this process,
this, this thing
that happens, if I'm about to die.

444
00:34:20,310 --> 00:34:23,380
Shhh, quiet now.
Cos that is not gonna happen.

445
00:34:23,380 --> 00:34:25,690
You ready? No.

446
00:34:39,130 --> 00:34:41,620
DOCTOR SCREAMS

447
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,650
Heat-shields failing at 5%.

448
00:35:17,610 --> 00:35:20,980
No! Martha,
you can't stop it, not yet.

449
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:23,860
What's happened?
Power's been cut in Engineering.

450
00:35:23,860 --> 00:35:27,700
But who's down there?
Leave it to me.

451
00:35:29,810 --> 00:35:32,310
DOCTOR GASPS

452
00:35:32,310 --> 00:35:34,810
HE SCREAMS

453
00:35:34,810 --> 00:35:37,110
Impact in 4.47.

454
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:45,060
Are we gonna do it in time?

455
00:35:50,550 --> 00:35:53,810
Come on! You're defrosting.

456
00:35:53,810 --> 00:35:57,080
Martha, listen.
Only got a moment, you've gotta go.

457
00:35:57,080 --> 00:36:01,300
No way!
Get to the front, vent the engines,

458
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:03,690
sun particles in the fuel,
get rid of them.

459
00:36:03,690 --> 00:36:05,720
I am not leaving you! You've got to!

460
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:08,790
Give back what they took!

461
00:36:08,790 --> 00:36:11,480
Doctor. PLEASE! GO!

462
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:13,400
I'll be back for you.

463
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:15,970
Impact in 4.08.

464
00:36:23,850 --> 00:36:26,650
You were right.

465
00:36:26,650 --> 00:36:29,300
It was my fault.

466
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:40,930
Impact in 3.43.

467
00:37:20,410 --> 00:37:23,750
I didn't know. I really didn't know.

468
00:37:23,750 --> 00:37:26,170
Korwin, please, stop.

469
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:30,770
Everyone must burn.

470
00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:39,610
Riley, Scannell. I'm sorry.
McDonnell! McDonnell!

471
00:37:42,490 --> 00:37:44,600
I love you.

472
00:37:55,350 --> 00:37:58,040
Exterior airlock open.

473
00:37:58,040 --> 00:38:01,690
It's the last door. We've
gotta keep going.

474
00:38:04,370 --> 00:38:07,250
Impact in 2.17.

475
00:38:12,250 --> 00:38:14,360
Primary engines critical.

476
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:17,240
Repeat, primary engines critical.

477
00:38:29,910 --> 00:38:34,130
Survival estimate projection, 0%.

478
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:40,930
Martha!

479
00:38:40,930 --> 00:38:42,200
Doctor!

480
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:44,890
What're you doing?

481
00:38:47,380 --> 00:38:49,110
I can't fight it.

482
00:38:49,110 --> 00:38:51,770
Give it back or...

483
00:38:56,020 --> 00:38:59,090
Burn with me. Burn with me, Martha.

484
00:39:00,250 --> 00:39:02,740
Impact in 1.21.

485
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:06,580
NO-O-O-O-O-O!

486
00:39:06,580 --> 00:39:08,120
Got it!

487
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:11,770
Life support systems
reaching critical.

488
00:39:11,770 --> 00:39:15,410
Repeat, life support systems
reaching critical.

489
00:39:15,410 --> 00:39:21,170
Impact in 1.06.
Collision alert. Collision alert.

490
00:39:21,170 --> 00:39:23,670
It's not working!
Why's it not working?!

491
00:39:23,670 --> 00:39:27,890
Collision alert. 58 seconds to
fatal impact. Vent the engines!

492
00:39:27,890 --> 00:39:30,200
Dump the fuel! What?

493
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:32,310
Sun particles in the fuel!
Get rid of them!

494
00:39:32,310 --> 00:39:33,930
DO IT!

495
00:39:33,930 --> 00:39:35,380
NOW!

496
00:39:40,570 --> 00:39:42,680
Come on, Doctor, hold on!

497
00:39:44,790 --> 00:39:49,480
Fuel dump in progress.

498
00:40:10,330 --> 00:40:13,210
It worked!
The auxiliaries are firing!

499
00:40:24,730 --> 00:40:26,260
Impact averted.

500
00:40:26,260 --> 00:40:28,920
Impact averted. Impact averted.

501
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:36,050
We're clear!

502
00:40:38,740 --> 00:40:41,050
We've got just enough reserves.

503
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:46,610
Doctor.

504
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:12,340
This is never your ship. Compact, eh?

505
00:41:12,340 --> 00:41:15,220
And another good word - robust.

506
00:41:15,220 --> 00:41:19,830
Barely a scorch mark on her.
We can't just leave you
drifting with no fuel.

507
00:41:19,830 --> 00:41:23,090
We've sent out an official mayday.
The authorities'll
pick us up soon enough.

508
00:41:23,090 --> 00:41:25,780
Though how we
explain what happened...

509
00:41:25,780 --> 00:41:31,620
Just tell them
that sun needs care and protection
just like any other living thing.

510
00:41:31,620 --> 00:41:35,770
So...you're off then?

511
00:41:35,770 --> 00:41:38,450
No chance I'll see you again?

512
00:41:40,180 --> 00:41:42,100
Not really.

513
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:43,830
It was nice -

514
00:41:43,830 --> 00:41:45,750
not dying with you.

515
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:53,620
I reckon you'll find someone worth
believing in. I think I already did.

516
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:09,370
Well done.

517
00:42:11,090 --> 00:42:12,630
Very hot.

518
00:42:15,890 --> 00:42:19,240
So, didn't really need
you in the end, did we?

519
00:42:20,310 --> 00:42:23,190
Sorry.

520
00:42:23,190 --> 00:42:26,530
How are you doing?

521
00:42:26,530 --> 00:42:30,100
Now! What d'you say, ice skating
on the mineral lakes of Kurhan.

522
00:42:30,100 --> 00:42:32,870
Fancy it? Whatever you like.

523
00:42:35,860 --> 00:42:37,400
By the way,

524
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:41,430
you'll be needing this.

525
00:42:41,430 --> 00:42:44,090
Really? Frequent flyer's privilege.

526
00:42:50,450 --> 00:42:52,370
Thank you.

527
00:42:52,370 --> 00:42:55,250
Don't mention it.

528
00:42:55,250 --> 00:42:57,170
Oh no.

529
00:42:57,170 --> 00:42:58,710
Mum!

530
00:43:03,510 --> 00:43:05,240
PHONE RINGS

531
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:07,540
Hello? It's me again.

532
00:43:07,540 --> 00:43:09,270
Three calls in one day?

533
00:43:09,270 --> 00:43:11,380
Sorry about earlier. Over-emotional.

534
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:13,490
Mad day. What're you doing tonight?

535
00:43:13,490 --> 00:43:16,950
Why don't you come round, I'll make
something nice, and we can catch up.

536
00:43:16,950 --> 00:43:18,760
Yeah. Tonight.

537
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:23,860
Do my best. Um, just remind me
what day is it again? Election day.

538
00:43:23,860 --> 00:43:25,400
Right. Course.

539
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:27,700
I'll be round for tea. Roughly.

540
00:43:27,700 --> 00:43:32,310
And what about... Anyway, gotta
go! See you later! Love you!

541
00:43:44,100 --> 00:43:45,370
Is that all?

542
00:43:45,370 --> 00:43:48,630
For now. Have you voted? Of course!

543
00:43:48,630 --> 00:43:51,510
Just don't expect me
to tell you who for.

544
00:43:51,510 --> 00:43:53,810
Thanks for all you're
doing, Mrs Jones.

545
00:43:53,810 --> 00:43:57,080
Mr Saxon will be very grateful.

546
00:44:03,220 --> 00:44:05,330
Martha, this watch is...

547
00:44:06,490 --> 00:44:10,020
If anything goes wrong,
it's all down to you, Martha.

548
00:44:10,020 --> 00:44:12,820
It's Monday, November 10th, 1913.

549
00:44:13,970 --> 00:44:16,280
We make quite a team. Don't we just!

550
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:19,050
You like pretty girls.
Oh, in the sky! Help me!

551
00:44:28,370 --> 00:44:30,870
Completely human.

552
