ALARM CLOCK BUZZES

2
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,700
Bye. See you later.

3
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:03,700
'This is a customer announcement.
The store closes in five minutes.'

4
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:10,000
Oi!

5
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,000
Wilson?

6
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:43,600
I've got the lottery money.

7
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:45,900
Wilson?

8
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
You there?

9
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:53,500
I can't hang about
cos they're closing the shop.

10
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,500
Wilson?

11
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:58,300
(Oh, come on.)

12
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,700
SOMETHING BANGS
Hello?

13
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,100
Hello? Wilson, it's Rose.

14
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:11,400
Hello?

15
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:14,400
W... Wilson?

16
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:41,200
Wilson!

17
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,600
Wilson?

18
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:58,400
DOOR SLAMS SHUT

19
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:09,500
(Oh, you're kidding me!)

20
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,900
SOMETHING BANGS

21
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,800
Is that someone mucking about?

22
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,400
Who is it?

23
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,800
OK. You got me. Very funny.

24
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:56,400
Right, I've got the joke!
Whose idea was this? Is it Derek's?

25
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:59,000
Is it?

26
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:01,600
Derek, is this you?

27
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,800
Run!

28
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:57,500
You pulled his arm off!
Yep, plastic.

29
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:01,700
Very clever, nice trick. Who are
they, students? A student thing?

30
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:04,100
Why would they be students?
I don't know!

31
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,800
You said it. Why students?

32
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:10,100
Cos... that many people dressed up
and being silly has to be students.

33
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:14,700
That makes sense. Well done.
Thanks. They're not students.

34
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:20,300
When Wilson finds them, he'll call the police.
- Who's Wilson?
- Chief electrician.
- Wilson's dead.

35
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:23,100
That's just not funny. That's sick!

36
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:25,800
Mind your eyes.
I've had enough of this.

37
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:29,700
Who are you, then?
Who's that lot down there...?

38
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,800
I said WHO are they?

39
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:34,000
They're living plastic creatures.

40
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:38,900
They're being controlled
by a relay device from the roof,
which would be a great big problem

41
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,900
IF I didn't have this. So I'm gonna
go upstairs and blow it up.

42
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I might well die, but don't worry(!)

43
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:48,700
You go home. Go and have
your lovely beans on toast.

44
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:52,500
Don't tell anyone.
If you do, you'll get them killed.

45
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:57,000
I'm the Doctor, what's your name?
Rose.

46
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:59,300
Nice to meet you. Run for your life!

47
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:57,400
TV: 'Central London has been closed
off as police investigate the fire.'

48
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:01,700
I know, it's on the telly! It's
everywhere, she's lucky to be alive.

49
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:04,900
Honestly, it's aged her.
Skin like an old Bible.

50
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,100
You'd think I was her daughter.

51
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:11,500
Oh, and here's himself. I've been
phoning! You could have been dead!

52
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:14,100
It's all on the news!
I can't believe your shop went up!

53
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:16,900
Honestly, I'm fine. Don't fuss!

54
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,900
But what happened? I don't know.

55
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,000
What caused it? I wasn't in there. I
was outside, I didn't see anything.

56
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:27,100
It's Debbie. She knows a man on the
Mirror, 500 quid for an interview.

57
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:29,300
Oh, that's brilliant, give it here.

58
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:35,400
You've got to find some way to make
money. I'm not bailing you out.

59
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,500
PHONE RINGS

60
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,400
Bev, she's alive!

61
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:42,700
I've told her,
sue for compensation...

62
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:46,700
She was within seconds of death.
You drinking tea? That's no good!

63
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,600
You need something stronger. I'm OK.

64
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:52,300
You deserve a proper drink.
We're going down the pub. My treat.

65
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:56,300
Is there a match on? ...No, no...
I'm just thinking about you!

66
00:08:56,400 --> 00:09:00,900
There's a match on, ain't there? We
COULD catch the last five minutes.

67
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Go on, then. I'm fine, really, go.

68
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:05,100
And get rid of that.

69
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:17,100
Bye-bye. Bye! Aaaggghhh!

70
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:21,700
'15 fire crews are present, though
it's thought there's little chance

71
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:24,500

ALARM CLOCK BUZZES

73
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:57,600
There's no point in getting up,
sweetheart. You've no job to go to.

74
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:03,800
There's Finch's. You could try them.

75
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:07,600
They've always got jobs.
Oh, great, the butcher's.

76
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:10,600
It might be good.
You were getting airs and graces.

77
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:14,900
I'm not joking about compensation,
you've had genuine shock and trauma.

78
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:20,800
Arianna got 2,000 quid off the
council, just cos the old man behind
the desk said she looked Greek!

79
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:24,900
I know she is Greek, but that's
not the point. It was a valid claim.

80
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Mum, you're such a liar! I said to
nail the cat-flap. We'll get strays!

81
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:36,400
I did it weeks back.
Na... you thought about it.

82
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:56,800
What are you doing here? I live here.
What do you do that for? Cos I do!

83
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:59,000
I'm here cos someone blew up my job!

84
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:04,300
I must have the wrong signal.
You're not plastic, are you?
Nope, bonehead. Bye.

85
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:06,100
You, inside, right now.

86
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,100
Who is it?

87
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:11,200
It's about last night.
He's part of the inquiry.

88
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:14,000
She deserves compensation!

89
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:16,600
Oh, we're talking millions.

90
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:19,600
I'm... I'm in my dressing gown.

91
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:22,300
Yes, you are.

92
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:25,700
There's a strange man in my bedroom.

93
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:30,700
Yes, there is.
..Well, anything could happen.

94
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:34,200
No.

95
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:39,000
Don't mind the mess. Coffee?

96
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:41,500
Might as well, thanks, just milk.

97
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,300
We should go to the police.

98
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:46,700
Seriously. That won't last.
He's gay and she's an alien.

99
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:50,900
I'm not blaming you, even if it was
some sort of joke... Sad ending.

100
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,300
It said on the news
they found a body. "Rose Tyler."

101
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:59,400
Ah, could've been worse.
Look at the ears!

102
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:02,700
He was nice. He was a nice bloke.

103
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:07,400
Anyway, if we do go to the police,
I wanna know what I'm saying.

104
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:09,900
I want you to explain. Maybe not.

105
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,600
FLAPPING SOUND
What's that? ...Have you got a cat?

106
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:20,600
No. We did have, but we just get
strays. They come in off the estate.

107
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:28,300
I told Mickey to chuck that out.

108
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:31,300
You're all the same.
Give a man a plastic hand...

109
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:34,900
Anyway, I don't even know your name.
Doctor what?

110
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:07,500
It's all right, I've stopped it.
There. See... armless! You think?!

111
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:12,300
Hold on a minute,
you can't just go swanning off?

112
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,300
I can. This is me, swanning off.

113
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:19,500
But that arm was moving,
it tried to kill me! Well observed.
You can't walk away!

114
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:23,500
That's not fair. You've got to tell
me what's going on. No, I don't.

115
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:29,600
All right, I'll go to the police.
I'll tell everyone.

116
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:35,900
You said I'd get people killed, so,
your choice. Tell me or I'll talk.

117
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Is that supposed to sound tough?
Sort of.

118
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:43,000
Doesn't work. Who are you?
Told you, the Doctor.

119
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:45,100
Yeah, but Doctor what?

120
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:47,800
Just the Doctor. The Doctor? Hello!

121
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:51,000
Is that meant to sound impressive?!

122
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:53,000
Sort of.

123
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:57,500
Come on then, you can tell me.
I've seen enough.

124
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:02,000
Are you the police? No! I was just
passing. I'm a long way from home...

125
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:06,000
But what have I done wrong? How come
those plastic things come after me?

126
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:09,900
Oh, suddenly the entire world
revolves around you.

127
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
You got in the way, that's all.

128
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:15,000
It tried to kill me!
It was after me, not you!

129
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:18,800
I was in the shop, you blundered in,
almost ruined it all!

130
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:24,300
I was tracking it down, it was
tracking me down. It fixed on you
cos you'd met me.

131
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:28,200
So, you're saying the entire world
revolves around you?

132
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:30,200
Sort of, yeah. You're full of it!

133
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:32,100
Sort of, yeah.

134
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:36,100
All this plastic stuff,
who else knows? No-one.

135
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:38,100
What, you're on your own?

136
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:42,200
Well, who else is there? I mean, you
lot, all you do is eat chips, sleep

137
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:46,700
and watch telly while underneath you,
there's a war going on.

138
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,600
OK. Start from the beginning.

139
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:55,900
I mean, if we're going with living
plastic, and I don't believe that,

140
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,300
how did you kill it?

141
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:02,400
The thing controlling it projects
life into it. I cut off the signal.

142
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:05,700
So, radio control? Thought control.

143
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,800
You all right? Yeah.

144
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:09,800
So... who's controlling it, then?

145
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:14,400
Long story. What's it all for? Shop
window dummies, what's that about?

146
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:18,400
Is someone trying to take over
Britain's shops?!

147
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,600
No!

148
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:23,100
Well, no! It's not a price war.

149
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:28,300
They want to overthrow the human race
and destroy you.

150
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:30,500
Do you believe me? No.

151
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:32,700
But you're still listening.

152
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:36,000
Really, though, Doctor... Tell me.

153
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:38,100
Who are you?

154
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:45,500
Do you know like we were saying?
About the Earth revolving?

155
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:49,400
It's like when you're a kid.

156
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:53,200
The first time they tell you
the world's turning

157
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:58,000
and you can't believe it cos it looks
like everything's standing still.

158
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:00,600
..I can feel it.

159
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,800
The turn of the Earth.

160
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:08,600
The ground beneath our feet
is spinning at 1, 000 miles an hour.

161
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:12,600
The entire planet is hurtling round
the sun at 67, 000 miles an hour.

162
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:16,500
I can feel it, we're falling
through Space, you and me.

163
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:20,900
Clinging to the skin of this tiny
little world, and if we let go...

164
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:29,300
That's who I am.
Now forget me, Rose Tyler.

165
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:31,700
Go home.

166
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:03,000
STRANGE MACHINE-LIKE NOISE

167
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,800
H... hey, here's my woman! Kit off.

168
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:38,000
Oh, shut up. Coffee?
Yeah, only if you wash the mug.

169
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:42,000
I don't mean rinse, I mean wash.
Can I use your computer?

170
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:45,600
Yeah, any excuse
to get in the bedroom.

171
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:48,500
Don't read my e-mails!

172
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:30,900
You're not coming in.

173
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,400
He's safe, he's got a wife and kids.

174
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:39,600
Who told you that? He did!
That's exactly what an internet
lunatic murderer would say.

175
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Um, hello, I've come to see Clive.
We've been e-mailing.

176
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:09,500
Dad! It's one of your nutters.

177
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:16,200
Sorry, hello! You must be Rose.
I'm Clive. Obviously.

178
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:20,700
I'd better tell you - my boyfriend's
in the car, in case you kill me!

179
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:24,700
No, good point! No murders!
Who is it?

180
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:30,300
It's to do with the Doctor,
she's been reading the website.
Please come through, I'm in the shed.

181
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:36,200
She? She's read a website
about the Doctor, she's a she?

182
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:44,700
This is quite sensitive, I couldn't
just send it. People might intercept.

183
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:48,500
If you know what I mean.
If you dig deep enough

184
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:52,900
and keep a lively mind, this Doctor
keeps cropping up all over the place.

185
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:57,300
Political diaries, conspiracy
theories, even ghost stories.

186
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:02,500
No first name, no last name,
just the Doctor. Always the Doctor.

187
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:07,300
The title seems to be passed from
father to son, like an inheritance.

188
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:10,200
That's your Doctor there, isn't it?

189
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:14,100
Yeah. I tracked it down to the
Washington Public Archive, last year.

190
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:18,600
The online photo's enhanced,
but if we look at the original...

191
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:35,200
November 22nd 1963, the assassination
of President Kennedy. See.

192
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,100
Must be his father.

193
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,500
Going further back...

194
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,700
April 1912,

195
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:48,800
this is a photograph of the Daniels
family of Southampton, and friend...

196
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:53,000
Taken the day before they were due to
go to the new world. On the Titanic.

197
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:57,100
But for some unknown reason, they
cancelled the trip, and survived.

198
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,900
And here we are...

199
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,700
1883, another Doctor.

200
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:06,700
Look, the same lineage,
he's identical...

201
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:11,700
This one washed up on the Sumatran
coast, the night Krakatoa exploded.

202
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:15,200
The Doctor is a legend,
woven throughout history.

203
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:17,300
When disaster comes, he's there.

204
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:22,400
He brings the storm in his wake,
and has one constant companion.
Who's that?

205
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:24,400
Death.

206
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:49,900
If the Doctor's back,
if you've seen him, Rose,

207
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,400
one thing's for certain.

208
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:54,700
We're all in danger.

209
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:34,300
Come on then. If he singled you out,
if the Doctor's making house calls...

210
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,700
..then God help you.

211
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:52,800
BIN ROARS

212
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:21,600
BIN BURPS
But who is he?

213
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:23,600
Who d'you think he is?

214
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:26,300
I think he's the same man.

215
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:33,300
I think he's immortal. I think
he's an alien from another world.

216
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:38,000
All right, he's a nutter.
Off his head.

217
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:41,400
Complete online conspiracy freak,
you win!

218
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:43,600
So, what are we going to do tonight?

219
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:46,300
I fancy a pizza.

220
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,300
Pizza! Puh-puh-puh.

221
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,700
Pizza! Or Chinese.

222
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:52,900
Pizzaaaaaaaa!

223
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:04,100
Should I try the hospital?

224
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:07,900
Suki said they had jobs going
in the canteen.

225
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,900
Is that it then, dishing out chips?

226
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,300
I could do A-levels. I dunno.

227
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:20,100
It's all Jimmy Stones's fault.
I only left school cos of him
and look where he ended up.

228
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,900
What do you think?

229
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,800
So where did you meet this Doctor?

230
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:26,300
Oh, sorry, was I talking about me?

231
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,300
I reckon it started at the shop,
am I right?

232
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,800
Was he something to do with that?
No.

233
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:33,100
Come on.

234
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,400
Sort of.

235
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:39,500
What was he doing there? I'm not
going on about it, really I'm not.

236
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,900
Cos I know it sounds daft,

237
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,300
but I don't think he's safe.

238
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:47,200
He's dangerous. You can trust me,
sweetheart.

239
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:50,100
HIS VOICE IS ROBOTIC AT TURNS
Babe, darling, sugar...

240
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:55,500
You can tell me anything.
Tell me about the Doctor and what
he's planning. I can help you, Rose.

241
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:59,600
That's all I want, sweetheart,
darling, babe, sugar sweetheart.

242
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:03,500
What are you doing that for?
Champagne. We didn't order any.

243
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:06,300
Where's the Doctor?
Madam, your champagne.

244
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:10,000
It's not ours.
Mickey, what is it, what's wrong?

245
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:12,500
I need know out how much he knows,
so where is he?

246
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:15,800
Doesn't anybody want this champagne?
Look, we didn't order...

247
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,900
Ah, gotcha. Don't mind me.
I'm just toasting the happy couple.

248
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,200
On the house!

249
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:31,200
Anyway!

250
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:45,900
Don't think that's gonna stop me.

251
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,200
Everyone, out, now!

252
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:56,800
Get out, get out, get out!

253
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:20,100
Open the gate! Use that tube thing!

254
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:22,100
Sonic screwdriver. Use it!

255
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:25,500
Nah, tell you what, let's go in here.

256
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:32,700
You can't hide in a wooden box!

257
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:39,200
He's gonna get us!

258
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:42,400
Doctor!

259
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,100
It's gonna follow us.

260
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:13,100
The assembled hordes of Genghis Khan
couldn't get through that door.

261
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:17,000
Believe me, they've tried!
Now, shut up a minute.

262
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:28,500
You see, the arm was too simple,
but a head's perfect.

263
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:33,600
I can use it to trace the signal
back to the original source.

264
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:36,100
Right. Where d'you want to start?

265
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:39,400
Um... The inside's bigger
than the outside.

266
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:41,500
Yes. It's... alien.

267
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:45,500
Yep... Are you alien?

268
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:48,200
Yes.

269
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:50,000
Is that all right? Yeah.

270
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:52,000
It's called the Tardis, this thing.

271
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:56,100
T-A-R-D-I-S, that's Time And
Relative Dimension In Space.

272
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,300
That's OK. Culture shock.

273
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:03,300
Happens to the best of us.
Did they kill him? Mickey?

274
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:05,300
Did they kill Mickey? Is he dead?

275
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:07,900
Oh, I didn't think of that.

276
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:13,700
He's my boyfriend! You pulled off
his head, they copied him,
and you didn't even think?

277
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:16,100
Now you're just gonna let him melt.
Melt?!

278
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:21,700
Aw, no, no, no, NO!

279
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:26,400
What are you doing? Following
the signal. It's fading!

280
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:30,100
No, no, no, no, no, no, NO!

281
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:34,600
Almost there, almost there...

282
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:36,800
Here we go!

283
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:42,800
You can't go out there.
It's not safe!

284
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:48,600
I lost the signal. I got so close.

285
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,700
We've moved. Does it fly?

286
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:55,000
It disappears there
and reappears here.

287
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:59,500
But if we're... somewhere else, that
headless thing's still on the loose.

288
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:05,200
Melted with the head.
Are you gonna witter on all night?
I'll have to tell his mother.

289
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:12,200
Mickey. I'll have to tell his
mother he's dead, and you just
went and forgot him. Again!

290
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:14,200
You were right. You are alien.

291
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:17,200
If I did forget some kid called
Mickey. He's not a kid!

292
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:20,900
..It's because I'm trying to save
every stupid ape blundering about

293
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:24,500
on this planet, all right?
All right?! Yes, it is!

294
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:28,200
If you are an alien, why do you
sound like you're from the north?

295
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:30,200
Lots of planets have a north!

296
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:34,100
..What's a police public call box?

297
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:41,200
It's a telephone box,
from the 1950s. It's a disguise.

298
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:46,100
OK. And, this, this living plastic,
what's it got against us?

299
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:50,200
Nothing. It loves you. You've got a
good planet, lots of smoke and oil,

300
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:55,200
plenty of toxins and dioxins,
perfect. Just what
the Nestene Consciousness needs.

301
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:58,900
Its food stock was destroyed in
the war, its protein planets rotted.

302
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:03,500
So. Earth. Dinner.
Any way of stopping it? Antiplastic.

303
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:05,200
Antiplastic? Antiplastic!

304
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:07,300
But first, I've got to find it.

305
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:10,400
How can you hide something that big
in a city this small?

306
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:12,400
Hide what? A transmitter.

307
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:15,700
The Consciousness
is controlling all plastic,

308
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:19,700
a transmitter boosts the signal. What
does it look like? A transmitter!

309
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:22,500
Round and massive -
in the middle of London.

310
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:26,500
A huge, metal, circular structure,
like a dish, like a wheel, radial,

311
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:30,700
close to where we're standing,
it must be completely invisible.

312
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:32,300
What?

313
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:36,100
What?

314
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:39,900
What is it? What?

315
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:44,300
Oh.

316
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:48,700
Fantastic!

317
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:12,700
Think. Plastic. Everywhere, every
artificial thing waiting to be alive.

318
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:16,100
The shop window dummies,
phones, wires, cables.

319
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:19,400
The breast implants.
Still, we've found the transmitter.

320
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:22,700
The Consciousness must be
somewhere underneath.

321
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:27,200
What about down here?

322
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,200
Looks good to me.

323
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:15,300
The Nestene Consciousness.

324
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:19,300
That's it, inside the vat,
a living plastic creature.

325
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:26,100
Well, tip in your antiplastic
and let's go. I'm not here to kill
it. I've got to give it a chance.

326
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:35,500
I seek audience with the Nestene
Consciousness under peaceful contract

327
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:39,500
according to Convention 15
of the Shadow Proclamation.

328
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:45,400
Thank you. If I might have
permission to approach.

329
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:49,500
Oh, my God.

330
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:53,900
Mickey! It's me! It's OK.

331
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,200
It's all right. Shhh.
That thing, down there...

332
00:32:57,300 --> 00:33:00,200
The liquid, it can talk!
Oh, you're stinking!

333
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:02,200
Doctor, they kept him alive!

334
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:06,200
Yeah, that was always a possibility -
keep him alive to maintain the copy.

335
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:10,500
You knew that and never said?! Can
we keep domestics outside, thank you!

336
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:25,300
Am I addressing the Consciousness?

337
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:27,700
Thank you. If I might observe,

338
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:32,300
you infiltrated this civilisation
by means of warp, shunt technology.

339
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:35,900
So, may I suggest, with greatest
respect, that you shunt off?!

340
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:40,700
Oh, don't give me that! It's an
invasion, plain and simple.

341
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:43,100
Don't talk
about constitutional rights.

342
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:48,300
I AM TALKING!

343
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:50,900
This planet is just starting.

344
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:56,300
These stupid, little people
have just learnt how to walk.
They are capable of so much more.

345
00:33:56,400 --> 00:34:01,100
I'm asking you, on their behalf.
Please, just go. Doctor!

346
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:10,200
That was just insurance!
I wasn't gonna use it.

347
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:16,500
I was not attacking you. I'm here to
help. I'm not your enemy, I swear.

348
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:21,700
What do you mean?

349
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:24,300
No! Honestly, no...

350
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:27,000
Yes, that's my ship.

351
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:30,200
That's not true!

352
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:34,200
I should know, I was there. I fought
in the war. It wasn't my fault.

353
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:37,600
I couldn't save your world.
I couldn't save any of them.

354
00:34:39,700 --> 00:34:41,500
What's it doing? It's the Tardis.

355
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:45,400
The Nestene's identified it as
superior technology. It's terrified!

356
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:48,100
It's going to the final base.

357
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:52,500
It's starting the invasion...
Get out, Rose! Just leg it!

358
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:56,900
Mum? Oh, there you are.
I was gonna phone.

359
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:01,800
You CAN get compensation. I've got
this document thing off the police.
Don't thank me!

360
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:04,500
Where are you, Mum? I'm in town.

361
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:06,700
Look, go! Just go home right now.

362
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:12,000
Darling, you're breaking up.
I'm just gonna do a bit shopping.
I'll see you later, ta-ra.

363
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:13,800
Mum? Mum?

364
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:24,500
It's the activation signal!
It's transmitting.

365
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:30,900
It's the end of the world.

366
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:42,100
There's no point in a spreadsheet
if you spend summer money in winter.

367
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:47,000
My God! I thought they were dummies!
I nearly had a heart attack.

368
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:16,900
It's true. Everything I've read.
All those stories, it's all true.

369
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:27,400
Get out, Rose! Just get out!

370
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:30,200
RUN! The stairs have gone.

371
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:37,800
I haven't got a key...

372
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:41,400
We're gonna die!

373
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:02,800
Leave him!

374
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:10,700
There's nothing you can do!

375
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,900
I've got no A-levels,

376
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,100
no job.

377
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:17,300
No future.

378
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:20,300
But I'll tell you what I have got.

379
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:23,400
Jericho Street Junior School
Under-7s gymnastic team.

380
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:25,500
I got the bronze!

381
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:40,500
Rose!

382
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:45,800
Now we're in trouble!

383
00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:23,200
Rose, don't go out of the house!

384
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:27,200
'Lt's not safe. There are these
things, they were shooting and... '

385
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:29,900
Hello?

386
00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:35,300
Fat lot of good you were!

387
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:41,500
Nestene Consciousness? Easy!

388
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:45,500
You were useless! You'd be dead if
it wasn't for me. Yes, I would.

389
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:48,700
..Thank you. Right, then!

390
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:50,800
I'll be off.

391
00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:52,800
Unless... I dunno.

392
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:54,800
You could come with me.

393
00:40:54,900 --> 00:41:00,900
This box isn't just a London hopper,
you know. It goes anywhere
in the universe. Free of charge.

394
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,300
Don't! He's an alien, he's a thing.

395
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:05,600
He's not invited.

396
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:08,600
What d'you think?

397
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:10,600
You could... stay here.

398
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:15,300
Fill your life with work and food and
sleep, or you could go... anywhere.

399
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:18,600
Is it always this dangerous? Yeah.

400
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:22,700
Yeah... I can't.

401
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:28,700
I've got to go and find my mum
and someone's got to look
after this stupid lump. So...

402
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,700
OK. See you around.

403
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:08,100
Come on, let's go.

404
00:42:27,100 --> 00:42:31,700
By the way, did I mention
it also travels in time?

405
00:42:35,100 --> 00:42:38,400
Thanks. Thanks for what?

406
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:41,200
Exactly.

407
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:54,500
This is the year five billion,

408
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:56,700
and this is the day... Hold on...

409
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:01,600
Welcome to the end of the world.

410
00:43:01,700 --> 00:43:05,700
Who the hell are you? Ooh,
I'm The Doctor this is Rose Tyler.

411
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:07,700
She's my plus one, is that all right?

412
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:13,900
Representing the Forest of Cheam,
we have Trees, the Moxx of Balhoon,

413
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:20,100
the Face of Boe, the last human -
the Lady Cassandra O'Brien.

414
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:23,700
Oh, now, don't stare,
look how thin I am.

415
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:27,500
That's not supposed to happen.

416
00:44:02,700 --> 00:44:04,700
