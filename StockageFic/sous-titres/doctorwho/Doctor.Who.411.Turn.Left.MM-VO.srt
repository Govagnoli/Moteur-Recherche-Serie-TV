1
00:00:27,488 --> 00:00:29,997
You're gonna love this.
One, two, three.

2
00:00:33,132 --> 00:00:34,020
It's lovely!

3
00:00:38,328 --> 00:00:39,861
You want to buy Shukina?

4
00:00:43,139 --> 00:00:46,279
<i>Or Peshwami? Most beautiful
Peshwami in all of Shan Shen.</i>

5
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:47,820
Er, no, thanks.

6
00:00:57,271 --> 00:00:58,923
Tell your fortune, lady?

7
00:00:59,023 --> 00:01:00,518
The future predicted.

8
00:01:00,618 --> 00:01:03,671
- Your life foretold.
- Oh, no, thanks.

9
00:01:04,143 --> 00:01:07,427
Don't you want to know
if you're going to be happy?

10
00:01:08,628 --> 00:01:10,455
I'm happy right now, thanks.

11
00:01:10,743 --> 00:01:11,976
You've got red hair.

12
00:01:12,076 --> 00:01:14,273
The reading's free for red hair.

13
00:01:15,669 --> 00:01:16,601
All right, then.

14
00:01:28,851 --> 00:01:30,909
Oh, you're fascinating!

15
00:01:31,235 --> 00:01:33,142
No, but you're good.

16
00:01:33,846 --> 00:01:36,611
I can see... a man.

17
00:01:37,262 --> 00:01:39,750
The most remarkable man.

18
00:01:40,202 --> 00:01:41,499
How did you meet him?

19
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:43,119
You're supposed to tell me.

20
00:01:43,551 --> 00:01:44,959
I see the future.

21
00:01:45,578 --> 00:01:46,873
Tell me the past.

22
00:01:47,248 --> 00:01:49,113
When did your lives cross?

23
00:01:50,521 --> 00:01:52,110
It's sort of complicated.

24
00:01:52,472 --> 00:01:54,780
I ended up in his spaceship
on my wedding day.

25
00:01:55,206 --> 00:01:58,140
- Long story.
- But what led you to that meeting?

26
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:00,369
All sorts of things,

27
00:02:01,902 --> 00:02:04,004
but my job, I suppose.

28
00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:07,452
It was on Earth,
this planet called Earth. Miles away.

29
00:02:07,789 --> 00:02:09,876
But I had this job, as a temp,

30
00:02:10,425 --> 00:02:12,950
I was a secretary,
in a place called HC Clements.

31
00:02:14,085 --> 00:02:16,070
<i>HC Clements, can I help you?</i>

32
00:02:21,695 --> 00:02:22,638
Sorry.

33
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:24,684
It's the incense.

34
00:02:25,009 --> 00:02:27,368
Just breathe deep.

35
00:02:29,113 --> 00:02:32,779
This job of yours.
What choices led you there?

36
00:02:34,431 --> 00:02:37,221
There was a choice.
Six months before.

37
00:02:38,235 --> 00:02:41,110
Cos the agency offered me
this contract with HC Clements.

38
00:02:42,189 --> 00:02:44,622
<i>There was this other job,
my mum knew this man...</i>

39
00:02:44,722 --> 00:02:48,652
Jival, he's called, Jival Chowdry.

40
00:02:49,916 --> 00:02:54,346
He runs that little photocopy
business and he needs a secretary.

41
00:02:54,446 --> 00:02:56,073
I've got a job!

42
00:02:56,173 --> 00:02:58,281
As a temp! This is permanent!

43
00:02:58,469 --> 00:03:00,322
It's 20,000 a year, Donna.

44
00:03:01,023 --> 00:03:03,226
HC Clements is in the City,

45
00:03:03,764 --> 00:03:07,230
it's nice, it's posh, so stop it!

46
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:13,960
Your life could have
gone one way or the other.

47
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:17,670
- What made you decide?
- I just did.

48
00:03:18,121 --> 00:03:19,637
But when was the moment?

49
00:03:20,081 --> 00:03:21,589
When did you choose?

50
00:03:24,279 --> 00:03:26,638
It won't take long, just turn right,

51
00:03:26,738 --> 00:03:30,385
we'll pop in and see Mr Chowdry,
so Suzette can introduce you.

52
00:03:30,485 --> 00:03:32,934
I'm going left,
if you don't like it, get out and walk!

53
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:37,226
If you turn right, you'll have a career.
Not just filling-in.

54
00:03:37,482 --> 00:03:38,858
You think I'm so useless.

55
00:03:38,958 --> 00:03:42,287
Oh, I know why you want
a job with HC Clements, lady.

56
00:03:42,387 --> 00:03:44,008
Cos you think you'll meet a man

57
00:03:44,108 --> 00:03:46,867
with lots of money and your
whole life will change.

58
00:03:46,967 --> 00:03:48,406
Well, let me tell you, sweetheart,

59
00:03:48,506 --> 00:03:52,392
City executives don't need temps.
Except for practice.

60
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,550
Yeah, well, they haven't met me!

61
00:03:59,043 --> 00:04:00,250
You turned left.

62
00:04:02,052 --> 00:04:04,767
<i>What if you'd turned right?
What then?</i>

63
00:04:05,831 --> 00:04:08,090
- Let go of my hands.
- What if it changes?

64
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:12,153
What if you go right?
What if you could still go right?

65
00:04:17,408 --> 00:04:18,278
Stop it!

66
00:04:21,214 --> 00:04:22,096
What's that?!

67
00:04:23,078 --> 00:04:23,992
What's on my back?

68
00:04:24,949 --> 00:04:25,850
What is it?

69
00:04:26,588 --> 00:04:27,452
What's on my back?

70
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:30,112
<i>Make the choice again, Donna Noble,</i>

71
00:04:30,212 --> 00:04:33,790
and change your mind. Turn right!

72
00:04:38,337 --> 00:04:39,630
I'm turning.

73
00:04:41,165 --> 00:04:42,948
Turn right.

74
00:04:44,005 --> 00:04:45,590
<i>Turn right!</i>

75
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:47,415
Turn RIGHT!

76
00:04:48,803 --> 00:04:52,858
Let me tell you, sweetheart,
City executives don't need temps.

77
00:04:52,958 --> 00:04:54,710
Except for practice.

78
00:04:55,254 --> 00:04:56,344
Yeah.

79
00:04:56,812 --> 00:04:58,126
Suppose you're right.

80
00:04:58,226 --> 00:05:02,093
<i>Turn right, and never meet that man.</i>

81
00:05:02,431 --> 00:05:06,129
<i>Turn right and change the world!</i>

82
00:05:30,334 --> 00:05:33,630

# We wish you a merry Christmas
We wish you a merry Christmas #

87
00:05:48,796 --> 00:05:52,615
# We wish you a merry Christmas
and a happy New Year... #

88
00:05:52,715 --> 00:05:54,068
Get out of the way!

89
00:05:56,972 --> 00:05:59,575
Here we are! Feed at the trough!

90
00:05:59,675 --> 00:06:01,273
Mooky says, let's go to the Boardwalk,

91
00:06:01,373 --> 00:06:03,948
- it's 2 for the price of 1.
- Christmas Eve? It'll be heaving!

92
00:06:04,048 --> 00:06:06,620
Well, exactly! Get in and grab 'em!

93
00:06:07,231 --> 00:06:10,295
That's the second round of drinks
you've bought, it was my turn.

94
00:06:10,604 --> 00:06:12,700
I can afford it. Promotion!

95
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:18,455
You are talking to Jival Chowdry's
Personal Assistant, I'll have you know.

96
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:22,892
Capital P, capital A,
£23,000 per annum, merci beaucoup!

97
00:06:22,992 --> 00:06:26,061
- Here's to Mr Chowdry!
- Mr Chowdry!

98
00:06:26,533 --> 00:06:28,006
<i>She gets all the luck.</i>

99
00:06:29,043 --> 00:06:31,603
What's wrong? What is it?

100
00:06:32,426 --> 00:06:33,005
Sorry?

101
00:06:33,105 --> 00:06:34,392
Someone spill a drink on me?

102
00:06:34,492 --> 00:06:35,007
No.

103
00:06:35,808 --> 00:06:38,907
Why d'you keep looking
at my shoulder, what's wrong?

104
00:06:39,143 --> 00:06:39,808
I don't know.

105
00:06:39,908 --> 00:06:42,018
Oh, don't tell me you're
getting all spooky again.

106
00:06:42,118 --> 00:06:45,480
It was bad enough when you saw the ghost
of Earl Mountbatten at the Boat Show.

107
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:46,931
What're you looking at?

108
00:06:47,031 --> 00:06:48,921
- What is it?
- It's like...

109
00:06:50,179 --> 00:06:52,331
It's like there's something I can't see.

110
00:06:52,762 --> 00:06:54,860
<i>No, shut up all of you!</i>

111
00:06:55,037 --> 00:06:57,311
<i>Come and see.
Just look at the sky!</i>

112
00:06:57,489 --> 00:06:59,954
It's a star! It's a Christmas star!

113
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:01,162
Come on, then.

114
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:10,322
What the hell is that?!
Ken Livingston, that's what!

115
00:07:10,422 --> 00:07:13,369
- Spending our money on decorations!
- How much did that cost?!

116
00:07:13,469 --> 00:07:16,560
Don't be so stupid,
it's flying, it's really flying!

117
00:07:21,449 --> 00:07:22,979
That's not a star,

118
00:07:23,173 --> 00:07:24,488
<i>that's a web.</i>

119
00:07:25,482 --> 00:07:28,171
It's heading east,
the middle of the city.

120
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:49,541
Alice, there's a great big
web star thing shooting at people

121
00:07:49,641 --> 00:07:51,120
and you're looking at ME!

122
00:07:52,187 --> 00:07:54,790
There's something on your back!

123
00:07:59,701 --> 00:08:01,746
Donna! Where you going?!

124
00:08:02,097 --> 00:08:05,265
You'll get yourself killed! Donna!!

125
00:08:09,972 --> 00:08:11,023
Fire!

126
00:08:17,604 --> 00:08:20,665
<i>Everyone stay back!
The Thames has been closed.</i>

127
00:08:21,423 --> 00:08:22,710
<i>Return to your homes.</i>

128
00:08:22,810 --> 00:08:25,535
<i>Keep away from the river,
and that's an order.</i>

129
00:08:27,793 --> 00:08:31,404
<i>Trap 1 to Greyhound 15,
what is your report? Over.</i>

130
00:08:31,655 --> 00:08:34,151
From the evidence I'd say
he managed to stop a creature,

131
00:08:34,372 --> 00:08:35,824
some sort of red spider.

132
00:08:36,248 --> 00:08:39,153
<i>Blew up the base underneath the barrier,
flooded the whole thing. Over.</i>

133
00:08:39,253 --> 00:08:41,520
<i>And where is he now? Over.</i>

134
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:45,332
We've found a body, sir. Over.

135
00:08:45,874 --> 00:08:48,407
- Is it him? Over.
- I think so.

136
00:08:48,717 --> 00:08:50,388
<i>Just didn't make it out in time.</i>

137
00:08:55,637 --> 00:08:56,846
The Doctor is dead.

138
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:59,735
<i>It must have happened
too fast for him to regenerate.</i>

139
00:09:06,315 --> 00:09:08,089
<i>Escort the ambulance back to unit base.</i>

140
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:22,870
What happened, what did they find?
Did they find someone?

141
00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:26,455
I don't know.
Bloke called the Doctor or something.

142
00:09:26,555 --> 00:09:27,620
Where is he?

143
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,758
They took him away. He's dead.

144
00:09:32,798 --> 00:09:34,394
I'm sorry. Did you know him?

145
00:09:35,524 --> 00:09:38,306
I mean, they didn't say his name.

146
00:09:38,964 --> 00:09:40,373
It could be any doctor.

147
00:09:41,890 --> 00:09:43,520
I came so far.

148
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:47,421
It could be anyone.

149
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:52,871
- What's your name?
- Donna.

150
00:09:53,514 --> 00:09:56,004
- And you?
- Oh, I was just...

151
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:59,000
passing by, I shouldn't even be here.

152
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:02,511
This is wrong. This is wrong.
This is so wrong.

153
00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:08,223
- Sorry, what was it, Donna what?
- Why d'you keep looking at my back?

154
00:10:08,323 --> 00:10:09,524
- I'm not.
- Yes, you are.

155
00:10:09,624 --> 00:10:11,780
You keep looking behind me,
you're doing it now.

156
00:10:12,142 --> 00:10:14,995
What is it, what's there?
Has someone put something on my back?

157
00:10:26,379 --> 00:10:30,430
You can't sack me!
I'm your Personal Assistant!

158
00:10:30,530 --> 00:10:34,409
You don't have to make a scene,
just come downstairs, and we can talk.

159
00:10:34,509 --> 00:10:36,681
Oh, I'll make a scene,
right in front of a tribunal.

160
00:10:36,781 --> 00:10:38,856
And the first thing I'll say is
"wandering hands"!

161
00:10:39,050 --> 00:10:41,212
You know what it's been like
for the past few months,

162
00:10:41,312 --> 00:10:42,606
ever since that Christmas thing.

163
00:10:42,706 --> 00:10:44,923
Half my contracts were on
the other side of the river,

164
00:10:45,023 --> 00:10:46,597
and the Thames is still closed off.

165
00:10:46,697 --> 00:10:48,928
Look, I can't deliver,
I'm losing a fortune.

166
00:10:49,028 --> 00:10:50,343
Well, sack one of this lot!

167
00:10:50,443 --> 00:10:53,461
Sack Cliff! He just sits there,
I don't know what he does all day.

168
00:10:53,561 --> 00:10:54,348
Sorry, Cliff.

169
00:10:54,448 --> 00:10:57,270
Actually, I'm not sorry,
what DO you do all day?

170
00:10:58,410 --> 00:10:59,440
What the hell?!

171
00:11:05,511 --> 00:11:06,762
Like an earthquake.

172
00:11:07,749 --> 00:11:08,786
That's weird.

173
00:11:09,445 --> 00:11:11,069
Funny sort of clouds...

174
00:11:12,191 --> 00:11:13,200
Who typed this?

175
00:11:13,507 --> 00:11:17,512
I'm your PA, did you get
someone else to type this?

176
00:11:20,029 --> 00:11:21,190
Beatrice!

177
00:11:22,616 --> 00:11:26,192
It sounds impossible,
but the entire hospital has vanished.

178
00:11:26,292 --> 00:11:28,302
<i>The Royal Hope no longer exists.</i>

179
00:11:28,450 --> 00:11:30,676
<i>It's not been destroyed,
there's no wreckage,</i>

180
00:11:30,776 --> 00:11:32,025
<i>it's simply gone.</i>

181
00:11:32,218 --> 00:11:36,874
Reports from bystanders say that
the rain lifted up around the hospital.

182
00:11:37,188 --> 00:11:40,335
Hole punch, having that.
Stapler, mine.

183
00:11:40,435 --> 00:11:43,384
Toy cactus,
you can have that, Beatrice, catch!

184
00:11:43,855 --> 00:11:46,751
Cliff, I'd leave you my mousemat,
but I'm worried you'd cut yourself.

185
00:11:46,851 --> 00:11:48,332
All right, Donna, have some respect.

186
00:11:48,432 --> 00:11:51,015
There's 2,000 people in that hospital.
And it's vanished!

187
00:11:51,115 --> 00:11:54,030
I'll show you vanishing.
Thanks for nothing!

188
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:57,316
Oh, and you know when that
money went missing from the kitty?

189
00:11:57,673 --> 00:11:59,903
Anne Marie. That's all I'm saying.

190
00:12:00,139 --> 00:12:01,784
Anne Marie!

191
00:12:04,201 --> 00:12:06,432
Oh, don't tell me,
the hospital's back!

192
00:12:06,875 --> 00:12:08,785
Well, isn't that wizard?!

193
00:12:09,908 --> 00:12:14,063
To confirm. The Royal Hope Hospital
was returned to its original position.

194
00:12:14,163 --> 00:12:15,731
But with only one survivor.

195
00:12:16,396 --> 00:12:19,773
The only person left alive,
is medical student Oliver Morgenstern.

196
00:12:19,873 --> 00:12:21,839
And there were these creatures.

197
00:12:22,311 --> 00:12:25,455
Like rhinos.
Talking rhinos in black leather...

198
00:12:25,555 --> 00:12:26,535
Rhinos?

199
00:12:26,635 --> 00:12:28,638
Rhinos, could be aliens.

200
00:12:29,539 --> 00:12:32,507
<i>We couldn't breathe,
we were running out of air.</i>

201
00:12:32,607 --> 00:12:36,652
A colleague of mine gave
me the last oxygen tank. Martha.

202
00:12:36,995 --> 00:12:38,319
Martha Jones.

203
00:12:39,291 --> 00:12:40,843
And she died.

204
00:12:41,716 --> 00:12:43,910
Least you've got a hole punch.

205
00:12:44,439 --> 00:12:45,698
And a raffle ticket.

206
00:12:45,798 --> 00:12:49,266
Yeah, well, they can keep the raffle,
I wouldn't take a penny off that man.

207
00:12:49,366 --> 00:12:51,898
Honestly, you two!
There's aliens on the news!

208
00:12:51,998 --> 00:12:54,053
They took that hospital
all the way to the moon,

209
00:12:54,153 --> 00:12:55,948
and you're banging on
about raffle tickets!

210
00:12:56,048 --> 00:12:59,451
Don't be daft, Gramps,
it wasn't the moon, it couldn't be.

211
00:12:59,551 --> 00:13:02,540
I am telling you, it is getting worse,
these past few years.

212
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:04,135
It's like all of a sudden,

213
00:13:04,235 --> 00:13:07,498
they suddenly know all about us
and there's keen eyes up there

214
00:13:07,598 --> 00:13:09,672
and they're watching us,
and they're not friendly.

215
00:13:09,772 --> 00:13:11,325
This stapler says Bea.

216
00:13:11,425 --> 00:13:13,677
Can't believe how well you're taking
me getting sacked.

217
00:13:13,777 --> 00:13:14,921
Thought you'd hit the roof.

218
00:13:15,021 --> 00:13:16,072
I'm just tired, Donna.

219
00:13:16,172 --> 00:13:17,839
What with your father and everything.

220
00:13:18,683 --> 00:13:21,030
To be honest, I've given up on you.

221
00:13:21,130 --> 00:13:23,281
<i>This further report just in
from Oliver Morgenstern.</i>

222
00:13:23,381 --> 00:13:24,975
There was this woman
who took control.

223
00:13:25,075 --> 00:13:28,894
Said she knew what to do, said she
could stop the MRI or something.

224
00:13:28,994 --> 00:13:32,121
Sarah Jane, her name was.
Sarah Jane Smith.

225
00:13:32,293 --> 00:13:35,320
Sarah Jane Smith was
a freelance investigative journalist,

226
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:37,751
<i>formerly of Metropolitan Magazine.</i>

227
00:13:37,851 --> 00:13:41,270
<i>Her body was recovered from
the hospital late this afternoon...</i>

228
00:13:41,785 --> 00:13:44,390
- What's for tea?
- I've got nothing in.

229
00:13:45,310 --> 00:13:46,312
I'll get chips.

230
00:13:46,798 --> 00:13:49,850
Last of my wages.
Fish and chips, yeah?

231
00:13:49,950 --> 00:13:53,740
<i>Along with his teenage friends
Maria Jackson and Clyde Langer.</i>

232
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:56,293
<i>It is feared that they also perished.</i>

233
00:14:24,857 --> 00:14:26,831
Blimey, you all right?!

234
00:14:28,225 --> 00:14:31,142
- What was that, fireworks, or...?
- I dunno. I was just...

235
00:14:31,514 --> 00:14:33,137
walking along. That's weird!

236
00:14:35,568 --> 00:14:36,655
You're the one...

237
00:14:37,714 --> 00:14:39,550
Christmas Eve, I met you, in town.

238
00:14:40,155 --> 00:14:42,564
- Donna, isn't it?
- What was your name?

239
00:14:42,915 --> 00:14:44,495
How're you doing?
You're looking good.

240
00:14:44,681 --> 00:14:46,090
What you been up to?

241
00:14:46,562 --> 00:14:48,674
- You're doing it again.
- What?

242
00:14:49,153 --> 00:14:50,510
Looking behind me.

243
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,460
People keep on doing that.

244
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:55,088
- Looking at my back.
- What sort of people?

245
00:14:55,903 --> 00:14:57,050
People in the street.

246
00:14:57,355 --> 00:14:58,280
Strangers.

247
00:14:58,770 --> 00:15:00,282
I just catch them, sometimes.

248
00:15:00,382 --> 00:15:01,634
Staring at me.

249
00:15:02,556 --> 00:15:04,151
Like they're looking at something.

250
00:15:04,351 --> 00:15:07,649
And then I get home and
I look and there's nothing there.

251
00:15:10,381 --> 00:15:13,156
- See? Look, now I'M doing it!
- What are you doing for Christmas?

252
00:15:13,478 --> 00:15:14,686
What am I what?!

253
00:15:14,786 --> 00:15:16,996
Next Christmas. Any plans?

254
00:15:17,339 --> 00:15:18,884
I dunno, that's ages away!

255
00:15:18,984 --> 00:15:21,272
Nothing much, I suppose. Why?

256
00:15:22,109 --> 00:15:23,950
Just, I think you should get out,

257
00:15:24,219 --> 00:15:27,150
you and your family. Don't stay
in London. Just leave the city.

258
00:15:28,223 --> 00:15:29,146
What for?

259
00:15:29,246 --> 00:15:31,591
Nice hotel. Christmas break?

260
00:15:32,392 --> 00:15:33,222
Can't afford it.

261
00:15:33,322 --> 00:15:35,205
Well, now,
you've got that raffle ticket.

262
00:15:36,363 --> 00:15:38,437
- How d'you know about that?
- First prize.

263
00:15:39,488 --> 00:15:40,868
Luxury weekend break.

264
00:15:41,069 --> 00:15:43,030
Use it, Donna Noble.

265
00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:46,030
Why won't you tell me your name?

266
00:15:50,481 --> 00:15:52,441
I think you

267
00:15:53,091 --> 00:15:54,507
should leave me alone.

268
00:16:03,465 --> 00:16:07,241
# Merry Xmas Everybody #
by Slade

269
00:16:09,043 --> 00:16:11,890
<i>Cor blimey! That's what I call posh!</i>

270
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:15,315
I said you were lucky!
Didn't I always say, my lucky star?

271
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:19,921
For God's sake, don't tell them
that we won it in a raffle. Be classy!

272
00:16:20,021 --> 00:16:22,824
- Dad, take those things off.
- No, I shan't, it's Christmas!

273
00:16:22,924 --> 00:16:25,527
I'll have that one, thank you,
it's got my liniment in it.

274
00:16:25,627 --> 00:16:27,329
I reckon we deserve this.

275
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:29,568
It's been a hell of a year.

276
00:16:29,668 --> 00:16:31,599
Your Dad would've loved this.

277
00:16:32,417 --> 00:16:33,081
Yeah.

278
00:16:34,157 --> 00:16:35,223
He would've.

279
00:16:43,647 --> 00:16:46,650
<i>Oy! Gramps!
Get that, that'll be breakfast!</i>

280
00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:48,330
We've got croissants!

281
00:16:48,691 --> 00:16:50,570
Why can't you get it? Lady Muck!

282
00:16:50,830 --> 00:16:53,132
It's Christmas Day,
I never get up before ten.

283
00:16:53,568 --> 00:16:56,115
Only madam there
was up with the dawn chorus.

284
00:16:56,215 --> 00:16:58,075
<i>Like when she was six years old!</i>

285
00:16:58,175 --> 00:17:00,485
I'm not wasting a second in this place!

286
00:17:01,228 --> 00:17:04,530
- How was the sofa?
- Oh, yeah, not so good, really.

287
00:17:07,766 --> 00:17:10,126
You know we could've paid
for a second room.

288
00:17:11,018 --> 00:17:11,737
Oi!

289
00:17:12,892 --> 00:17:15,295
- Merry Christmas!
- Merry Christmas.

290
00:17:15,395 --> 00:17:16,889
Merry Christmas, Dad.

291
00:17:17,149 --> 00:17:21,416
All right! All right, my darlin'!
Grub's up! Merry Christmas!

292
00:17:21,516 --> 00:17:22,533
Merry Christmas, sir.

293
00:17:23,942 --> 00:17:24,936
Have you seen this?

294
00:17:25,036 --> 00:17:27,010
Nice early breakfast,
then we'll go for a walk.

295
00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:28,834
People always say that at Christmas,

296
00:17:28,934 --> 00:17:31,408
"Oh, we all went for a walk"
I've always wanted to do that.

297
00:17:31,508 --> 00:17:34,550
So, walk first, presents later, yeah?

298
00:17:34,650 --> 00:17:35,644
Donna, come and see.

299
00:17:35,744 --> 00:17:37,590
Tienes algo en tu espalda.

300
00:17:37,869 --> 00:17:39,049
- What?
- Look at the telly.

301
00:17:39,149 --> 00:17:40,607
Tienes algo en tu espalda.

302
00:17:40,707 --> 00:17:42,739
What does it mean?
Don't know what you're saying.

303
00:17:42,839 --> 00:17:46,028
- Donna, look at the TV!
- Tienes algo en tu espalda!

304
00:17:53,492 --> 00:17:56,238
For God's sake, Donna,
don't just stand there, come and look!

305
00:17:57,111 --> 00:18:02,736
<i>This footage is live and genuine.
The object is falling on Central London.</i>

306
00:18:02,836 --> 00:18:06,133
I repeat, this is not a hoax.
A replica of the Titanic

307
00:18:06,233 --> 00:18:09,935
is falling out of the sky and
it's heading for Buckingham Palace.

308
00:18:10,364 --> 00:18:13,572
<i>We're getting this footage from
the Guinnevere range of satellites.</i>

309
00:18:13,895 --> 00:18:15,982
Is that... a film or something?

310
00:18:18,467 --> 00:18:21,077
<i>The Royal Air Force
has declared an emerg...</i>

311
00:18:31,501 --> 00:18:32,752
It's gone dead.

312
00:18:33,646 --> 00:18:34,412
All of them.

313
00:18:34,512 --> 00:18:37,525
No, but the Titanic?!
Oh, don't be daft!

314
00:18:38,983 --> 00:18:40,414
Is that like a sequel?

315
00:18:41,501 --> 00:18:42,170
Oh...

316
00:18:44,097 --> 00:18:46,037
Oh, God rest their souls.

317
00:18:52,023 --> 00:18:54,068
<i>I was supposed to be out there,
selling papers.</i>

318
00:18:54,168 --> 00:18:55,807
I should've been there.
We all should.

319
00:18:56,451 --> 00:18:57,580
We'd be dead.

320
00:18:58,492 --> 00:18:59,812
That's everyone.

321
00:19:00,627 --> 00:19:02,987
Every single person we know.

322
00:19:03,409 --> 00:19:04,639
The whole city.

323
00:19:06,055 --> 00:19:07,020
Can't be.

324
00:19:07,685 --> 00:19:09,165
But it is. It's gone.

325
00:19:10,288 --> 00:19:11,539
London's gone.

326
00:19:12,719 --> 00:19:14,810
If you hadn't won that raffle...

327
00:19:21,710 --> 00:19:24,761
Leeds?! I'm not moving to Leeds!

328
00:19:24,861 --> 00:19:26,191
I'm afraid it's Leeds,

329
00:19:26,291 --> 00:19:28,906
or you can wait in the hostel
for another three months.

330
00:19:29,006 --> 00:19:30,437
All I want is a washing machine.

331
00:19:30,537 --> 00:19:33,010
What about Glasgow,
I heard there was jobs going in Glasgow.

332
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:34,227
You can't pick and choose!

333
00:19:34,327 --> 00:19:37,023
All of Southern England's
flooded with radiation,

334
00:19:37,123 --> 00:19:39,760
7 million people in need of relocation,

335
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:44,528
and now France has closed its borders,
so it's Leeds or nothing. Next!

336
00:19:57,450 --> 00:20:00,344
<i>The Daniels Family,
billetted at number 15.</i>

337
00:20:00,444 --> 00:20:03,583
Mr & Mrs Obego, billetted at number 31.

338
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:06,265
<i>Miss Coltrane, you're in number 8.</i>

339
00:20:06,365 --> 00:20:08,770
The Noble family,
billetted at number 29...

340
00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:10,810
That's us! Come on. Off we go.

341
00:20:12,024 --> 00:20:12,760
All right?

342
00:20:14,870 --> 00:20:17,446
Used to be a nice little family,
number 29.

343
00:20:17,546 --> 00:20:19,778
They missed one mortgage
payment, just one,

344
00:20:19,878 --> 00:20:22,259
they got booted out, all for you lot.

345
00:20:22,359 --> 00:20:25,020
Don't get all chippy
with me, Vera Duckworth.

346
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:27,808
Pop your clogs on and go
and feed t'whippets.

347
00:20:27,908 --> 00:20:28,873
Sweetheart, come on.

348
00:20:28,973 --> 00:20:32,105
You're not gonna make the
world any better by shouting at it.

349
00:20:32,899 --> 00:20:34,108
I can try.

350
00:20:40,414 --> 00:20:42,252
What happens, do we get keys?

351
00:20:42,352 --> 00:20:45,127
- I don't know, do I?
- Who do we ask, the soldiers?

352
00:20:46,186 --> 00:20:48,844
Hey-ey! Is a big house!

353
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:52,320
Room for all! Welcome! In you come.

354
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:55,900
- I thought this was OUR house.
- Is many people's house! Is wonderful!

355
00:20:56,032 --> 00:20:57,360
In! In! In!

356
00:20:58,511 --> 00:21:00,435
<i>We've been here
for eight weeks already.</i>

357
00:21:00,535 --> 00:21:04,139
<i>I had a nice little paper shop
in Shepherd's Bush. All gone now.</i>

358
00:21:04,239 --> 00:21:07,957
So, upstairs, we have the
Merchandani family, seven of them,

359
00:21:08,057 --> 00:21:09,869
good family, good kids.

360
00:21:10,334 --> 00:21:13,001
Except that one, be careful of him.

361
00:21:13,659 --> 00:21:18,022
That's a joking! Where's that smile?

362
00:21:18,679 --> 00:21:21,912
Rocco Colosanto,
I'm here with my wife, and her sister,

363
00:21:22,012 --> 00:21:24,151
her husband, their kids,
and their daughter's kids.

364
00:21:24,251 --> 00:21:25,353
We've got the front room.

365
00:21:25,453 --> 00:21:29,115
My mother, she's got the back room.
She's old, you forgive.

366
00:21:29,508 --> 00:21:34,740
And this, this is you,
this is your palace!

367
00:21:37,726 --> 00:21:40,090
- What d'you mean, this is us?
- You live here!

368
00:21:41,029 --> 00:21:43,095
- We living in the kitchen?!
- You got camp beds!

369
00:21:43,195 --> 00:21:46,035
You got the cooker, you keep warm,
you got the fridge, you keep cool!

370
00:21:46,135 --> 00:21:47,931
- Is good!
- What about the bathroom?

371
00:21:48,031 --> 00:21:51,435
- Nobody lives in the bathroom!
- No, I mean, is there a rota?

372
00:21:51,535 --> 00:21:54,081
Is pot luck! Is fun!

373
00:21:54,303 --> 00:21:57,177
I go wake Mamma,
she likes new people.

374
00:21:57,277 --> 00:22:00,370
Mamma! Is people! Nice people!

375
00:22:02,842 --> 00:22:03,866
Ah, well...

376
00:22:04,810 --> 00:22:07,077
We'll settle in, won't we? Make do.

377
00:22:07,542 --> 00:22:09,509
Bit of wartime spirit, eh?

378
00:22:09,838 --> 00:22:12,638
But there isn't a war.
There's no fight,

379
00:22:13,589 --> 00:22:14,669
There's just...

380
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:16,394
this.

381
00:22:16,957 --> 00:22:18,498
Well, America, they'll save us.

382
00:22:18,598 --> 00:22:19,689
It was on the news.

383
00:22:19,789 --> 00:22:24,374
They're gonna send Great Britain
50 billion quid in financial aid!

384
00:22:24,815 --> 00:22:26,184
God bless America!

385
00:22:26,284 --> 00:22:30,640
America is in crisis with
over 60 million reported dead.

386
00:22:31,150 --> 00:22:35,726
Sixty million people have dissolved
into fat. And the fat is walking.

387
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:39,343
<i>People's fat has come to life
and is walking through the streets.</i>

388
00:22:39,879 --> 00:22:41,695
<i>And there are spaceships.</i>

389
00:22:41,795 --> 00:22:45,630
<i>There are reports of spaceships
over every major US city.</i>

390
00:22:45,730 --> 00:22:47,189
<i>The fat is flying...</i>

391
00:22:47,289 --> 00:22:48,290
Aliens.

392
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:50,298
Yeah.

393
00:22:50,464 --> 00:22:51,580
<i>...into the air.</i>

394
00:22:53,533 --> 00:22:56,879
Mary McGinty, d'you remember her?

395
00:22:57,580 --> 00:22:58,596
Who was she?

396
00:22:59,010 --> 00:23:01,621
Worked in the newsagent on a Sunday.

397
00:23:02,577 --> 00:23:04,451
Little woman, black hair.

398
00:23:05,566 --> 00:23:07,054
Never really spoke to her.

399
00:23:07,597 --> 00:23:08,591
She'll be dead.

400
00:23:09,378 --> 00:23:11,259
<i>Every day, I think of someone else.</i>

401
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:12,843
<i>All dead.</i>

402
00:23:13,294 --> 00:23:15,160
Maybe she went away for Christmas.

403
00:23:15,646 --> 00:23:16,505
Maybe.

404
00:23:18,507 --> 00:23:21,725
I'll go out tomorrow,
I'll walk into town.

405
00:23:22,269 --> 00:23:23,537
There's got to be work.

406
00:23:23,815 --> 00:23:25,689
Everyone needs secretaries.

407
00:23:26,082 --> 00:23:28,970
Soon as I'm earning,
we'll get a proper place.

408
00:23:29,572 --> 00:23:30,802
Just you wait, Mum.

409
00:23:31,403 --> 00:23:32,930
What if it never gets better?

410
00:23:33,401 --> 00:23:34,610
Course it will.

411
00:23:34,953 --> 00:23:36,526
<i>Even the bees are disappearing.</i>

412
00:23:36,626 --> 00:23:38,614
You don't see bumble bees any more.

413
00:23:38,772 --> 00:23:40,030
They'll sort us out,

414
00:23:41,475 --> 00:23:42,764
the Emergency Government.

415
00:23:43,644 --> 00:23:45,675
- They'll do something.
- What if they don't?

416
00:23:47,198 --> 00:23:48,213
Then...

417
00:23:49,508 --> 00:23:50,709
we'll complain.

418
00:23:50,809 --> 00:23:52,170
Who's gonna listen to us?

419
00:23:52,721 --> 00:23:54,044
Refugees.

420
00:23:54,709 --> 00:23:56,240
We haven't even got a vote.

421
00:23:57,015 --> 00:23:58,635
We're just no-one, Donna.

422
00:23:59,415 --> 00:24:00,874
We don't exist.

423
00:24:01,489 --> 00:24:04,665
# ..And I spent all my
money on whisky and beer.. #

424
00:24:04,765 --> 00:24:07,790
I am going to kill that man!

425
00:24:10,472 --> 00:24:12,800
Now, listen, Mussolini!

426
00:24:13,815 --> 00:24:17,582
I am telling you, for the last time,
to button it!

427
00:24:17,918 --> 00:24:21,002
If I hear one more sea shanty...

428
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:26,690
Always loved a sing-song.

429
00:24:27,138 --> 00:24:29,993
# ..I'm just a poor boy,
nobody loves me

430
00:24:30,093 --> 00:24:32,939
# He's just a poor boy
from a poor family

431
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:35,929
# Spare him his life
from this monstrosity

432
00:24:37,373 --> 00:24:38,670
# Easy come, easy go

433
00:24:38,770 --> 00:24:40,900
# Will you let me go...? #

434
00:24:43,704 --> 00:24:45,585
You stay here!

435
00:24:46,428 --> 00:24:47,530
Everyone, stay!

436
00:24:50,307 --> 00:24:53,175
Hey! Firing at the car, is not so good!

437
00:24:53,275 --> 00:24:54,906
You crazy or what?!

438
00:24:55,070 --> 00:24:56,637
It's this ATMOS thing, it won't stop,

439
00:24:56,737 --> 00:24:57,845
it's like gas, it's toxic.

440
00:24:57,945 --> 00:24:58,994
Well, switch it off!

441
00:24:59,094 --> 00:25:01,347
I have done! It's still going!
It's all the cars,

442
00:25:01,447 --> 00:25:04,043
every single ATMOS car!
They've gone mad...

443
00:25:06,231 --> 00:25:07,890
You... lady, turn round.

444
00:25:08,271 --> 00:25:09,780
- Turn around!
- Are you crazy, boy?

445
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:10,280
Now!

446
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:12,562
- Put that down!
- Turn round!

447
00:25:13,630 --> 00:25:14,664
Do what he says!

448
00:25:14,790 --> 00:25:16,502
Show me your back! Turn around!

449
00:25:17,281 --> 00:25:18,604
<i>Show me your back!</i>

450
00:25:24,268 --> 00:25:24,864
Sorry.

451
00:25:25,244 --> 00:25:26,202
I thought I saw...

452
00:25:26,302 --> 00:25:30,359
Call yourself a soldier?!
Pointing guns at innocent women!

453
00:25:30,459 --> 00:25:31,640
<i>You're a disgrace!</i>

454
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:34,050
<i>In my day, we'd have
had you court-martialled!</i>

455
00:25:34,499 --> 00:25:38,189
Donna, where are you going?
It's not safe at night!

456
00:25:38,396 --> 00:25:40,410
Donna! Donna!

457
00:25:45,356 --> 00:25:45,985
Hello.

458
00:25:47,761 --> 00:25:48,443
Hi.

459
00:25:49,139 --> 00:25:50,791
It's the ATMOS devices.

460
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:54,674
We're lucky, it's not so bad here,
Britain hasn't got that much petrol.

461
00:25:54,774 --> 00:25:56,150
But all over Europe...

462
00:25:56,980 --> 00:25:59,132
China, South Africa...

463
00:25:59,733 --> 00:26:01,600
They're getting choked by gas.

464
00:26:02,494 --> 00:26:03,852
Can't anyone stop it?

465
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:06,043
Yeah, they're trying right now.

466
00:26:06,143 --> 00:26:09,898
This little band of fighters,
on board the Sontaran ship.

467
00:26:11,414 --> 00:26:12,865
Any second now.

468
00:26:27,896 --> 00:26:29,176
And that was...?

469
00:26:29,958 --> 00:26:31,291
That was the Torchwood team.

470
00:26:32,048 --> 00:26:33,324
Gwen Cooper,

471
00:26:33,695 --> 00:26:35,708
Ianto Jones, they gave their lives.

472
00:26:36,629 --> 00:26:40,189
And Captain Jack Harkness has
transported to the Sontaran homeworld.

473
00:26:40,408 --> 00:26:41,580
There's no-one left.

474
00:26:44,612 --> 00:26:46,401
You're always wearing
the same clothes.

475
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:48,816
Why won't you tell me your name?

476
00:26:48,916 --> 00:26:51,494
None of this was meant to happen.

477
00:26:52,782 --> 00:26:53,815
There was a man.

478
00:26:55,035 --> 00:26:57,708
This wonderful man.
And he stopped it.

479
00:26:57,927 --> 00:27:02,088
The Titanic, the Adipose, the ATMOS,
he stopped them all from happening.

480
00:27:02,282 --> 00:27:03,850
That... Doctor?

481
00:27:04,565 --> 00:27:06,412
- You knew him.
- Did I?

482
00:27:07,818 --> 00:27:08,364
When?

483
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:11,987
I think you dream about him sometimes.
It's a man in a suit.

484
00:27:12,231 --> 00:27:15,084
Tall, thin man. Great hair.

485
00:27:15,741 --> 00:27:18,175
Some really great hair.

486
00:27:19,307 --> 00:27:20,533
Who are you?

487
00:27:20,909 --> 00:27:23,324
I was like you. I used to be you.

488
00:27:23,475 --> 00:27:25,170
Cos you travelled with him, Donna,

489
00:27:25,332 --> 00:27:27,436
you travelled with the Doctor
in a different world.

490
00:27:27,536 --> 00:27:29,726
I never met him. And he's dead.

491
00:27:29,826 --> 00:27:31,354
He died underneath the Thames

492
00:27:31,454 --> 00:27:33,462
on Christmas Eve.
But you were meant to be there.

493
00:27:33,562 --> 00:27:36,515
He needed someone to stop him,
and that was you. You made him leave.

494
00:27:37,072 --> 00:27:38,311
You saved his life.

495
00:27:46,395 --> 00:27:49,110
Doctor! You can stop now!

496
00:27:50,350 --> 00:27:52,995
Stop it! I don't know what you're
talking about, leave me alone!

497
00:27:53,095 --> 00:27:55,726
Something's coming, Donna.
Something worse.

498
00:27:56,015 --> 00:27:58,527
The whole world is stinking.

499
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:01,305
How could anything be worse than this?

500
00:28:01,405 --> 00:28:04,170
Trust me. We need the Doctor
more than ever. I've...

501
00:28:05,092 --> 00:28:07,533
I've been pulled across
from a different universe,

502
00:28:07,633 --> 00:28:09,615
because every single
universe is in danger.

503
00:28:09,947 --> 00:28:11,490
It's coming, Donna.

504
00:28:11,750 --> 00:28:15,193
<i>It's coming from across the stars,
and nothing can stop it.</i>

505
00:28:15,293 --> 00:28:16,370
What is?

506
00:28:17,396 --> 00:28:18,503
The darkness.

507
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:25,035
Well, what d'you keep telling me for?
What am I supposed to do?!

508
00:28:25,454 --> 00:28:26,580
I'm nothing special.

509
00:28:26,824 --> 00:28:30,989
I mean... I'm not...
I'm nothing special. I'm a temp!

510
00:28:31,387 --> 00:28:33,650
I'm not even that! I'm nothing.

511
00:28:33,802 --> 00:28:37,890
Donna Noble, you're the most important
woman in the whole of creation.

512
00:28:39,414 --> 00:28:40,515
Oh, don't.

513
00:28:41,508 --> 00:28:43,727
Just... don't.

514
00:28:45,754 --> 00:28:46,890
I'm tired.

515
00:28:48,417 --> 00:28:50,901
I'm so tired.

516
00:28:52,788 --> 00:28:54,440
I need you to come with me.

517
00:28:55,284 --> 00:28:57,080
Yeah, well,

518
00:28:58,112 --> 00:29:01,092
blonde hair might work on the men,
but you ain't shifting me, lady!

519
00:29:01,192 --> 00:29:02,444
That's more like it.

520
00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:05,866
- I've got plenty more.
- You'll come with me.

521
00:29:07,061 --> 00:29:08,387
Only when you want to.

522
00:29:08,885 --> 00:29:10,092
You'll have a long wait, then.

523
00:29:10,192 --> 00:29:11,231
Not really, just 3 weeks.

524
00:29:11,331 --> 00:29:13,915
Tell me, does your grandfather
still own that telescope?

525
00:29:16,493 --> 00:29:17,725
He never lets go of it.

526
00:29:18,163 --> 00:29:19,328
Three weeks' time.

527
00:29:20,911 --> 00:29:22,381
But you've got to be certain.

528
00:29:22,726 --> 00:29:25,066
Cos when you come with me,
Donna... I'm sorry,

529
00:29:25,866 --> 00:29:26,999
so sorry, but...

530
00:29:29,266 --> 00:29:30,586
you're going to die.

531
00:29:48,095 --> 00:29:50,717
And you! I'll gonna
miss you most of all!

532
00:29:50,817 --> 00:29:52,930
All flame-haired and fiery!

533
00:29:53,652 --> 00:29:55,805
Oh, but why d'you have to go?

534
00:29:55,961 --> 00:29:59,097
It's the new law!
England for the English, et cetera.

535
00:29:59,347 --> 00:30:01,493
They can't send us home,
the oceans are closed,

536
00:30:01,593 --> 00:30:02,751
they build labour camps!

537
00:30:02,851 --> 00:30:05,960
I know, but labour doing what?
There aren't any jobs.

538
00:30:06,725 --> 00:30:09,650
Sewing, digging, is good!

539
00:30:09,910 --> 00:30:13,495
Now, stop it
before I kiss you too much...

540
00:30:15,515 --> 00:30:16,406
Wilfred!

541
00:30:17,425 --> 00:30:18,470
My capitano!

542
00:30:34,248 --> 00:30:35,862
<i>It'll be quiet with him gone.</i>

543
00:30:36,382 --> 00:30:38,250
<i>Still, we'll have more room.</i>

544
00:30:38,655 --> 00:30:39,641
Labour camps.

545
00:30:40,623 --> 00:30:42,469
That's what they called them last time.

546
00:30:43,032 --> 00:30:44,010
What d'you mean?

547
00:30:49,142 --> 00:30:50,250
It's happening again.

548
00:30:51,069 --> 00:30:51,857
What is?

549
00:30:58,102 --> 00:30:58,828
'Scuse me!

550
00:30:59,297 --> 00:31:00,861
'Scuse me, where
are you taking them?

551
00:31:01,512 --> 00:31:02,738
Where are you going?

552
00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:04,803
Where are you going?

553
00:31:05,178 --> 00:31:06,824
Where are you going?!

554
00:31:07,820 --> 00:31:10,060
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?!

555
00:31:28,336 --> 00:31:29,619
I asked about jobs.

556
00:31:30,345 --> 00:31:31,315
With the army.

557
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:33,740
They said I wasn't qualified.

558
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:41,605
You were right. You said I should
have worked harder at school.

559
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:49,567
Suppose I've always
been a disappointment.

560
00:31:50,493 --> 00:31:51,206
Yeah.

561
00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:09,193
You know we'd get a bit of cash
if we sold this thing.

562
00:32:09,512 --> 00:32:10,613
Don't you dare.

563
00:32:12,152 --> 00:32:17,204
I always imagined, your old age...
I'd have put a bit of money by.

564
00:32:17,649 --> 00:32:18,823
Make you comfy.

565
00:32:20,062 --> 00:32:20,975
Never did.

566
00:32:21,964 --> 00:32:23,097
I'm just useless.

567
00:32:27,082 --> 00:32:29,170
You're supposed to say,
"No, you're not."

568
00:32:30,379 --> 00:32:32,050
Ah, it must be the alignment...

569
00:32:32,150 --> 00:32:32,725
What's wrong?

570
00:32:32,825 --> 00:32:36,198
Well, I dunno, I mean it can't be
the lens cos I was looking at Orion,

571
00:32:36,298 --> 00:32:38,213
the constellation of Orion.

572
00:32:38,313 --> 00:32:41,347
You take a look.
Now, tell me, what can you see?

573
00:32:41,447 --> 00:32:43,900
- Where?
- Well, up there, in the sky!

574
00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:48,480
Well, I can't see anything.
It's just black.

575
00:32:48,580 --> 00:32:51,313
Well, I mean it's working.
The telescope is working.

576
00:32:51,413 --> 00:32:52,095
Well...

577
00:32:52,633 --> 00:32:54,754
- maybe it's the clouds.
- There's no clouds.

578
00:32:54,854 --> 00:32:56,725
- Well, there must be!
- There's not!

579
00:32:56,825 --> 00:33:01,108
It was there, an entire constellation.

580
00:33:03,629 --> 00:33:04,330
<i>Look!</i>

581
00:33:05,758 --> 00:33:06,458
Look there.

582
00:33:08,758 --> 00:33:09,684
<i>They're going out.</i>

583
00:33:10,785 --> 00:33:11,842
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

584
00:33:12,599 --> 00:33:15,410
Donna, the stars are going out.

585
00:33:23,921 --> 00:33:25,210
I'm ready.

586
00:33:43,199 --> 00:33:46,046
<i>Loadstone testing now at 15.4,</i>

587
00:33:46,146 --> 00:33:47,998
<i>repeat 15.4.</i>

588
00:33:50,934 --> 00:33:53,173
- Ma'am.
- I've told you, don't salute.

589
00:33:53,273 --> 00:33:55,413
Well, if you're not going
to tell us your name...

590
00:33:55,663 --> 00:33:56,842
What, you don't know either?

591
00:33:56,942 --> 00:33:59,683
I've crossed too many different
realities. Trust me, the wrong word

592
00:33:59,783 --> 00:34:03,330
in the wrong place can change
an entire causal nexus.

593
00:34:03,430 --> 00:34:05,540
She talks like that. A lot.

594
00:34:06,353 --> 00:34:08,587
And you must be... Miss Noble.

595
00:34:09,075 --> 00:34:09,838
Donna.

596
00:34:10,276 --> 00:34:12,660
Captain Erisa Magambo.
Thank you for this.

597
00:34:12,948 --> 00:34:15,031
- I don't even know what I'm doing.
- Is it awake?

598
00:34:15,131 --> 00:34:17,675
Seems to be quiet, today.
Ticking over.

599
00:34:18,147 --> 00:34:19,361
<i>Like it's waiting.</i>

600
00:34:20,349 --> 00:34:21,580
D'you want to see it?

601
00:34:23,559 --> 00:34:24,986
What's a "police box"?

602
00:34:25,086 --> 00:34:27,626
They salvaged it from underneath
the Thames. Just go inside.

603
00:34:27,726 --> 00:34:29,684
- What for?
- Just go in.

604
00:34:48,048 --> 00:34:49,794
<i>No way!</i>

605
00:35:21,597 --> 00:35:22,623
What d'you think?

606
00:35:25,789 --> 00:35:26,796
Can I have a coffee?

607
00:35:26,896 --> 00:35:29,009
Time And Relative Dimension in Space.

608
00:35:30,397 --> 00:35:31,880
This room used to shine with light.

609
00:35:32,587 --> 00:35:33,700
I think it's dying.

610
00:35:39,552 --> 00:35:40,970
It's still trying to help.

611
00:35:41,955 --> 00:35:44,338
And... it belonged to the Doctor?

612
00:35:44,438 --> 00:35:47,198
He was a Time Lord. Last of his kind.

613
00:35:47,473 --> 00:35:49,222
But if he was so special,

614
00:35:50,417 --> 00:35:51,580
what was he doing with me?

615
00:35:51,881 --> 00:35:53,120
He thought you were brilliant.

616
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:55,103
- Don't be stupid.
- But you are.

617
00:35:55,203 --> 00:35:58,143
It just took the Doctor to show you
that, simply by being with him.

618
00:35:58,663 --> 00:36:01,647
He did the same to me,
to everyone he touches.

619
00:36:04,294 --> 00:36:05,683
Were you and him...?

620
00:36:15,921 --> 00:36:17,570
- D'you want to see it?
- No.

621
00:36:22,049 --> 00:36:22,772
Go on, then.

622
00:36:22,950 --> 00:36:24,703
We don't know how the TARDIS works,

623
00:36:24,803 --> 00:36:27,127
but we've managed to scrape off
the surface technology,

624
00:36:27,227 --> 00:36:28,850
enough to show you the creature.

625
00:36:30,105 --> 00:36:31,039
It's a creature?

626
00:36:31,364 --> 00:36:32,378
Just stand here.

627
00:36:32,641 --> 00:36:33,980
Out of the circle, please.

628
00:36:35,656 --> 00:36:36,720
Yes, ma'am.

629
00:36:37,928 --> 00:36:39,235
Can't you stay with me?

630
00:36:40,612 --> 00:36:41,585
Ready?

631
00:36:42,199 --> 00:36:44,445
And... activate.

632
00:36:51,271 --> 00:36:53,755
- Open your eyes, Donna.
- Is it there?

633
00:36:53,855 --> 00:36:55,520
Open your eyes. Look at it.

634
00:36:56,815 --> 00:36:59,174
- I can't.
- It's part of you, Donna. Look.

635
00:37:08,988 --> 00:37:13,290
It's OK, it's OK, it's OK, calm down!
Donna, Donna, Donna! OK.

636
00:37:24,929 --> 00:37:25,624
What is it?

637
00:37:26,193 --> 00:37:27,288
We don't know.

638
00:37:27,651 --> 00:37:30,066
Oh... thanks!

639
00:37:30,470 --> 00:37:31,778
It feeds off time.

640
00:37:32,372 --> 00:37:35,294
By changing time, by making
someone's life take a different turn,

641
00:37:35,394 --> 00:37:38,517
like, er, meetings never made,

642
00:37:39,519 --> 00:37:41,026
<i>children never born, </i>

643
00:37:41,395 --> 00:37:42,637
a life never loved.

644
00:37:44,051 --> 00:37:47,104
- But with you it's...
- I never did anything important.

645
00:37:47,204 --> 00:37:50,708
Yes, you did. One day, that thing
made you turn right, instead of left.

646
00:37:50,808 --> 00:37:52,755
- When was that?
- You wouldn't remember.

647
00:37:52,855 --> 00:37:55,590
It was the most ordinary day
in the world. But by turning right,

648
00:37:55,859 --> 00:37:59,807
you never met the Doctor. And the whole
world just changed around you.

649
00:38:00,335 --> 00:38:01,930
Can you get rid of it?

650
00:38:02,190 --> 00:38:04,017
No, I can't even touch it.

651
00:38:05,049 --> 00:38:06,761
Seems to be in a state of flux.

652
00:38:07,487 --> 00:38:09,921
What does that mean?

653
00:38:10,259 --> 00:38:11,172
I don't know.

654
00:38:11,773 --> 00:38:13,613
Sort of thing the Doctor would say.

655
00:38:13,713 --> 00:38:14,732
You liar!

656
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:18,474
You told me I was special.

657
00:38:19,181 --> 00:38:23,085
But it's not me,
it's this thing, I'm just a host!

658
00:38:23,254 --> 00:38:25,262
No, there's more than that...

659
00:38:25,775 --> 00:38:27,159
The readings are strange.

660
00:38:27,697 --> 00:38:30,012
It's like reality is just
bending around you.

661
00:38:30,112 --> 00:38:32,002
Because of this thing!

662
00:38:32,102 --> 00:38:34,429
No, no, we're getting
separate readings from you.

663
00:38:34,653 --> 00:38:37,155
And they've always been there,
since the day you were born.

664
00:38:37,255 --> 00:38:39,445
This is not relevant to the mission.

665
00:38:39,983 --> 00:38:41,935
I thought it was just
the Doctor we needed,

666
00:38:42,768 --> 00:38:46,304
but it's the both of you.
The Doctor and Donna Noble. Together.

667
00:38:47,005 --> 00:38:48,732
To stop the stars from going out.

668
00:38:49,615 --> 00:38:50,477
Why?

669
00:38:52,038 --> 00:38:54,170
What can I do?

670
00:39:00,303 --> 00:39:01,500
Turn it off!

671
00:39:03,220 --> 00:39:03,646
Please.

672
00:39:03,890 --> 00:39:05,485
- Captain.
- Power down.

673
00:39:14,334 --> 00:39:16,568
It's still there, though.

674
00:39:18,864 --> 00:39:19,803
What can I do...

675
00:39:20,876 --> 00:39:22,096
to get rid of it?

676
00:39:23,291 --> 00:39:24,770
You're going to travel in time!

677
00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:28,071
The TARDIS has tracked down the moment
of intervention, Monday the 25th,

678
00:39:28,171 --> 00:39:29,435
10:01 in the morning.

679
00:39:29,535 --> 00:39:32,730
Your car was on Little Sutton, leading
to Ealing Road, but you turned right,

680
00:39:32,830 --> 00:39:34,035
heading for Griffin's Parade.

681
00:39:34,135 --> 00:39:36,738
You need to turn left.
You've got to go back,

682
00:39:36,838 --> 00:39:38,050
turn left. Got that, Donna?

683
00:39:38,150 --> 00:39:41,715
At 10:01, make yourself turn left,
heading for the Chiswick High Road.

684
00:39:41,815 --> 00:39:44,998
Keep the jacket on at all times it's
insulation against temporal feedback.

685
00:39:45,098 --> 00:39:47,488
This will correspond to
local time wherever you land.

686
00:39:47,588 --> 00:39:49,730
This is to combat dehydration.

687
00:39:59,220 --> 00:40:00,697
This is where we leave you.

688
00:40:00,797 --> 00:40:02,436
Don't want to see that thing on my back.

689
00:40:02,536 --> 00:40:04,513
No, the mirrors are just incidental.

690
00:40:04,613 --> 00:40:06,655
<i>They bounce chronon
energy back into the centre,</i>

691
00:40:06,755 --> 00:40:09,608
which we control
and decide the destination.

692
00:40:09,971 --> 00:40:11,428
It's a time machine.

693
00:40:11,979 --> 00:40:13,437
It's a time machine.

694
00:40:13,756 --> 00:40:14,732
If you could...

695
00:40:21,332 --> 00:40:22,408
Powering up!

696
00:40:27,952 --> 00:40:30,236
- How d'you know it's gonna work?
- Hmm?

697
00:40:30,630 --> 00:40:35,330
Oh, we... we don't.
We're... we're just guessing.

698
00:40:37,773 --> 00:40:38,987
Brilliant!

699
00:40:39,087 --> 00:40:40,939
<i>Just remember,
when you get to the junction,</i>

700
00:40:41,039 --> 00:40:43,667
change the car's direction
by one minute past ten.

701
00:40:43,790 --> 00:40:45,850
- How do I do that?
- It's up to you.

702
00:40:46,245 --> 00:40:49,081
Well... I'll just have to...

703
00:40:49,525 --> 00:40:52,728
run up to myself and...
have a good argument.

704
00:40:53,103 --> 00:40:55,913
- I'd like to see that.
- Activate lodestone.

705
00:40:58,926 --> 00:40:59,821
Good luck.

706
00:41:00,591 --> 00:41:02,650
- I'm ready!
- One minute past ten.

707
00:41:03,137 --> 00:41:04,739
Cos I understand now!

708
00:41:05,452 --> 00:41:07,104
You said I was gonna die, but...

709
00:41:07,404 --> 00:41:11,890
you mean this whole world,
it's gonna blink out of existence...

710
00:41:12,375 --> 00:41:16,188
but that's not dying,
cos a better world takes its place.

711
00:41:16,776 --> 00:41:17,819
The Doctor's world!

712
00:41:18,714 --> 00:41:19,971
<i>And I'm still alive!</i>

713
00:41:22,111 --> 00:41:25,095
That's right, isn't it?
I don't die. If I change things,

714
00:41:25,195 --> 00:41:28,744
I don't die. That's...
that's right, isn't it?

715
00:41:33,036 --> 00:41:33,890
I'm sorry.

716
00:41:34,650 --> 00:41:36,010
But I can't die!

717
00:41:37,622 --> 00:41:38,970
<i>I've got a future!</i>

718
00:41:40,006 --> 00:41:42,370
With the Doctor, you told me!

719
00:41:43,510 --> 00:41:44,523
Activate!

720
00:42:19,391 --> 00:42:20,040
But...

721
00:42:20,835 --> 00:42:22,856
Hold on... But this is...

722
00:42:23,719 --> 00:42:24,620
I'm not...

723
00:42:26,272 --> 00:42:27,661
This is Sutton Court!

724
00:42:29,153 --> 00:42:32,675
I'm half a mile away!
I'M HALF A MILE AWAY!

725
00:42:36,030 --> 00:42:37,236
Four minutes.

726
00:42:38,694 --> 00:42:39,695
Oh, my God!

727
00:42:44,100 --> 00:42:45,639
Jival Chowdry,

728
00:42:46,809 --> 00:42:49,732
he runs that little photocopy
business in Merchant Street

729
00:42:49,832 --> 00:42:51,497
and he needs a secretary.

730
00:42:51,666 --> 00:42:53,280
I've got a job!

731
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:06,071
HC Clements is in the city.
It's nice, it's posh,

732
00:43:06,255 --> 00:43:07,627
so stop it!

733
00:43:17,841 --> 00:43:20,300
It won't take long,
just turn right.

734
00:43:22,727 --> 00:43:25,170
I'm going left, if you don't like it,
get out and walk!

735
00:43:27,535 --> 00:43:28,934
You think I'm so useless.

736
00:43:29,034 --> 00:43:32,246
Oh, I know why you want
a job with HC Clements, lady.

737
00:43:32,346 --> 00:43:34,110
Cos you think you'll meet a man.

738
00:43:41,470 --> 00:43:42,900
I'm not gonna get there.

739
00:43:48,368 --> 00:43:49,500
You're gonna die.

740
00:43:56,660 --> 00:44:00,525
City executives don't need
temps, except for practice.

741
00:44:01,967 --> 00:44:02,580
Yeah.

742
00:44:03,493 --> 00:44:04,850
Suppose you're right.

743
00:44:09,947 --> 00:44:10,730
Please.

744
00:44:18,116 --> 00:44:19,770
Can you hear that?

745
00:44:20,506 --> 00:44:23,265
- Oh, no! Go back!
- Oi! Get a move on!

746
00:44:25,186 --> 00:44:28,268
- The traffic's stopping.
- Something must've happened.

747
00:44:38,187 --> 00:44:39,232
Tell him this.

748
00:44:40,358 --> 00:44:41,491
Two words.

749
00:44:52,479 --> 00:44:55,115
Well, that decides it.
I'm not sitting in a traffic jam.

750
00:44:55,334 --> 00:44:56,864
<i>I'm going left! I'm going left!</i>

751
00:44:56,964 --> 00:44:58,190
<i>Left... left... left...</i>

752
00:45:02,750 --> 00:45:03,730
<i>Left...</i>

753
00:45:03,902 --> 00:45:05,570
<i>Left... left...</i>

754
00:45:18,494 --> 00:45:20,490
What the hell is that?!

755
00:45:20,590 --> 00:45:22,348
You were so strong.

756
00:45:23,580 --> 00:45:25,126
What are you?

757
00:45:25,795 --> 00:45:27,575
What will you be?

758
00:45:29,101 --> 00:45:30,553
<i>What will you be?</i>

759
00:45:33,762 --> 00:45:34,788
Everything all right?

760
00:45:35,727 --> 00:45:36,824
Oh, God...!

761
00:45:39,295 --> 00:45:40,665
What was that for?!

762
00:45:41,603 --> 00:45:42,698
I don't know!

763
00:45:50,414 --> 00:45:51,703
<i>Can't remember.</i>

764
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:54,200
It's slipping away.

765
00:45:55,732 --> 00:45:58,810
You know, like when you think
of a dream, and it sort of goes.

766
00:45:59,467 --> 00:46:00,662
Just got lucky, this thing.

767
00:46:00,912 --> 00:46:02,483
It's one of the Trickster's Brigade.

768
00:46:03,559 --> 00:46:05,517
Changes a life in tiny little ways.

769
00:46:05,980 --> 00:46:08,775
Most times, the universe just
compensates around it, but with you...

770
00:46:09,363 --> 00:46:11,496
great big parallel world!

771
00:46:12,616 --> 00:46:15,438
Hold on, you said
parallel worlds are sealed off.

772
00:46:15,695 --> 00:46:16,460
They are.

773
00:46:16,723 --> 00:46:18,410
But you had one created around you.

774
00:46:19,463 --> 00:46:22,570
Funny thing is...
seems to be happening a lot. To you.

775
00:46:23,511 --> 00:46:24,381
How d'you mean?

776
00:46:24,481 --> 00:46:26,441
Well, the Library. Then this.

777
00:46:27,242 --> 00:46:30,620
Just goes with the job, I suppose.

778
00:46:30,933 --> 00:46:33,961
Sometimes I think there's way
too much coincidence around you, Donna.

779
00:46:34,268 --> 00:46:37,315
I met you once. Then I met
your grandfather. Then I met you again.

780
00:46:37,525 --> 00:46:40,528
In the whole wide universe,
I met you for a second time.

781
00:46:41,923 --> 00:46:43,925
It's like something's
binding us together.

782
00:46:45,195 --> 00:46:47,673
Don't be so daft.
I'm nothing special.

783
00:46:47,773 --> 00:46:49,518
Yes, you are, you're brilliant.

784
00:46:50,983 --> 00:46:52,215
He thought you were brilliant.

785
00:46:54,449 --> 00:46:55,468
SHE said that.

786
00:46:56,640 --> 00:46:57,372
Who did?

787
00:46:57,691 --> 00:46:58,473
That woman.

788
00:46:59,486 --> 00:47:00,763
I can't remember...

789
00:47:00,863 --> 00:47:02,358
She never existed, now.

790
00:47:02,802 --> 00:47:03,891
No, but she said...

791
00:47:04,417 --> 00:47:05,370
<i>The stars...</i>

792
00:47:08,079 --> 00:47:09,693
She said the stars are going out.

793
00:47:09,793 --> 00:47:12,970
- Yeah, but that world's gone.
- No, but she said it was all worlds.

794
00:47:13,297 --> 00:47:14,398
Every world.

795
00:47:15,380 --> 00:47:17,515
She said the darkness is coming.

796
00:47:17,984 --> 00:47:19,650
- Even here.
- Who was she?

797
00:47:19,993 --> 00:47:22,333
- I don't know.
- What did she look like?

798
00:47:23,309 --> 00:47:24,103
She was...

799
00:47:25,664 --> 00:47:26,480
blonde.

800
00:47:26,679 --> 00:47:27,536
What was her name?

801
00:47:27,636 --> 00:47:29,540
- I don't know.
- Donna, what was her name?

802
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:33,170
But she told me...

803
00:47:33,674 --> 00:47:34,637
<i>to warn you.</i>

804
00:47:35,294 --> 00:47:37,080
She said... two words.

805
00:47:37,231 --> 00:47:39,340
What two words? What were they?
What did she say?

806
00:47:45,358 --> 00:47:46,441
"Bad Wolf."

807
00:47:48,895 --> 00:47:50,020
What does it mean?

808
00:48:12,532 --> 00:48:13,790
Doctor, what is it?

809
00:48:14,409 --> 00:48:15,767
What's Bad Wolf?

810
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:18,909
It's the end of the universe.

811
00:48:32,521 --> 00:48:34,917
Ladies and gentlemen, we are at war.

812
00:48:35,110 --> 00:48:37,370
- It can't be.
- There's nothing I can do.

813
00:48:37,525 --> 00:48:40,515
- Oh, my God!
- What is it, who are they?

814
00:48:40,766 --> 00:48:42,048
What are we going to do?

815
00:48:42,868 --> 00:48:43,970
It's impossible.

816
00:48:44,391 --> 00:48:45,674
It can't be!

817
00:48:46,043 --> 00:48:47,588
I'm sorry, we're dead.

818
00:48:47,688 --> 00:48:48,952
Doctor, come back!

819
00:48:50,629 --> 00:48:52,187
It's only just beginning.

820
