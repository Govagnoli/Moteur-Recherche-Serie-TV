1
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:17,300
Sneed and Company offer
their sincerest condolences, sir,
in this most trying hour.

2
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:22,100
Grandmama had a good innings,
Mr Sneed.

3
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:24,200
She was so full of life,

4
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:26,600
I can't believe she's gone.

5
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:28,600
Not gone, Mr Redpath, sir.

6
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:30,500
Merely sleeping.

7
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,400
May I have a moment?

8
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:37,100
Yes, of course.

9
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,900
I shall be in the next, er, room
should you require anything.

10
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,700
HE CHOKES

11
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:09,400
Oh, no!

12
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:11,700
No!

13
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:18,300
Gwyneth!

14
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:21,300
Get down here now!
We've got another one!

15
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,900
GHOULISH MOANS

16
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:26,800
Hold that one down!
I'm holding this one down!

17
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:29,300
Well, hold them both down!
It's not gonna work.

18
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,600
Oi! I promised you a time machine!

19
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:36,000
Now you've seen the future,
let's have a look at the past...
How does 1860 sound?

20
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:37,500
What happened in 1860?

21
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,700
Let's find out!
Hold on... here we go!

22
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:49,600
Gwyneth!

23
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:52,400
Where are you, girl?

24
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,200
Gwyneth!

25
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:57,800
Where've you been? I was shouting.

26
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:00,100
Been in the stable
breaking the ice for Samson.

27
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:02,100
Well, get back in there
and harness him up!

28
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,900
Whatever for, sir?

29
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,100
The stiffs are getting lively again.
Mr Redpath's grandmother,
she's is up there on her feet,

30
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:12,600
and out there somewhere, on the
streets, we've got to find her.

31
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:16,100
Mr Sneed, for shame,
how many more times? It's ungodly!

32
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:22,300
Don't look at me like it's <i>MY</i> fault.
Now come on, hurry up, she was 86,
she can't have got far!

33
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:26,000
What about Mr Redpath?
Did you deal with him?

34
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:27,600
No.

35
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:28,900
SHE did.

36
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:31,600
That's awful, sir.

37
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:38,600
I know it's not my place,
and please forgive me for
talking out of turn, sir,

38
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,200
but this is getting beyond now.

39
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:47,200
Something terrible is
happening in this house
and we've got to get help.

40
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:52,100
And we will, as soon as
I've got that dead old woman
locked up and safe and sound.

41
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,700
Now, stop prevaricating, girl.

42
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:56,500
Get the hearse ready.
We're going bodysnatching.

43
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:00,100
WHOOSH OF THE TARDIS

44
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,700
Blimey! Telling me! You all right?

45
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:15,100
Yeah, I think so. Nothing broken.

46
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,900
Did we make it? Where are we?

47
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:22,400
I did it! Give the man a medal.
Earth, Naples, December 24th, 1860.

48
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:25,600
That's so weird. It's Christmas.

49
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:27,700
All yours.

50
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,400
But it's like...

51
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:31,900
Think about it, though.

52
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:37,600
Christmas 1860 happens once,
just once, and then it's...

53
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:40,500
gone, it's finished,
it'll never happen again.

54
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,000
Except for you.

55
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:47,300
You can go back and see
days that are dead and gone.

56
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:50,500
A hundred thousand sunsets ago.

57
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,600
No wonder you never stay still.

58
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:54,300
Not a bad life.

59
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,700
Better with two.

60
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:00,900
Come on then! Oi, oi, oi!

61
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,300
Where d'you think you're going?
1860.

62
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,800
Dressed like that,
you'll start a riot, Barbarella.

63
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:08,700
There's a wardrobe through there,
1st left, 2nd right,

64
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,700
under the stairs, past the bins,
on your left. Hurry up!

65
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,300
Not a sign.

66
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,400
Where is she?

67
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,900
She's vanished into the ether, sir.
Where can she be?

68
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:33,100
You tell me, girl. What do you mean?

69
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,300
Gwyneth, you know full well.

70
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:38,900
No, sir, I can't. Use the sight.

71
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:44,300
It's not right, sir. Find the
old lady or you're dismissed.

72
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,900
Now.

73
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,100
Look inside, girl.

74
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,700
Look deep.

75
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,400
Where is she?

76
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,100
She's lost, sir.

77
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:01,000
She's so alone.

78
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:04,400
Oh, my Lord.
So many strange things in her head.

79
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,500
But where?

80
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,900
She was excited.

81
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,100
About tonight.

82
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:14,700
Before she passed on,
she was going to see him.

83
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,600
Who's him? The great man.

84
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:23,000
All the way from London,
the great, great man.

85
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,500
Mr Dickens? Mr Dickens?

86
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,900
Excuse me, sir,
Mr Dickens, this is your call.

87
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:31,500
Are you quite well, sir?

88
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,700
Splendid. Splendid. Sorry!

89
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,300
Time you were on, sir.

90
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,100
Absolutely.

91
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:40,200
I was just brooding...

92
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:42,500
Christmas Eve.

93
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:45,600
Not the best of times to be alone.

94
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:49,200
Did no-one travel with you, sir?
No lady wife waiting out front?

95
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:50,600
I'm afraid not.

96
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:53,100
You can have mine if you want.

97
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:55,700
Oh, I wouldn't dare.

98
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:58,400
I've, I've been rather...
let's say, clumsy,

99
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:01,400
with family matters.

100
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:05,700
Thank God I'm
too old to cause any more trouble.

101
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:09,000
You speak as if it's all over, sir.
Oh, it's never over!

102
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:13,500
On and on I go.

103
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:16,100
The same old show.

104
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:23,100
I'm like a ghost, condemned to repeat
myself through all eternity.

105
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:26,400
It's never too late, sir, you could
always think up some new turns.

106
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:28,100
No, I can't.

107
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:31,400
Even MY imagination grows stale.

108
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:38,900
I'm an old man, perhaps I've thought
everything I will ever think.

109
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:45,000
Still. The lure of the limelight's
as potent as a pipe, eh?

110
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:53,300
On with the motley.

111
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:05,500
Blimey. Don't laugh.

112
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,200
You look beautiful.

113
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,800
Considering.

114
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:11,600
Considering what?

115
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:14,200
That you're human.

116
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:17,700
I think that's a compliment.
Aren't you gonna change?

117
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,700
I've changed my jumper! Come on.

118
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:22,300
You stay there,
you've done this before.

119
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,600
This is mine.

120
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:45,500
Ready for this?

121
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:48,200
Here we go.

122
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:49,700
History.

123
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,800
APPLAUSE

124
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:29,400
# Oh tidings of comfort and joy... #

125
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:31,900
She's in there, sir,
I'm certain of it.

126
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,700
Right.

127
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:43,000
I got the flight a bit wrong.

128
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:46,700
I don't care.
It's not 1860, it's 1869.

129
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:49,000
I don't care. And it's not Naples.

130
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:51,600
I don't care. It's Cardiff.

131
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:56,000
Right.

132
00:09:56,100 --> 00:10:02,500
Now, it is a fact
that there was nothing particular
at all about the knocker

133
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:06,900
on the door of this house but,
let any man explain to me,

134
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:14,400
if he can, how it happened
that Scrooge, having his key
in the lock of the door,

135
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:22,300
saw in the knocker,
without its undergoing
any intermediate process of change,

136
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:26,100
not a knocker, but Marley's face!

137
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,800
MURMURS OF SURPRISE

138
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:29,800
Marley's face!

139
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:35,800
It looked at Scrooge

140
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:40,100
as Marley used to look.

141
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,900
It looked like...

142
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:46,500
..Oh, my Lord...

143
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:51,500
it looked... like that!

144
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,100
SOME LADIES GASP

145
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:57,000
What phantasmagoria is this?

146
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,200
ETHEREAL GROAN FOLLOWED BY SHRIEKS

147
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,100
That's more like it.

148
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,300
HIGH-PITCHED SCREAM

149
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:14,300
Stay in your seats, I, I beg you!

150
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:18,200
It is a lantern show, trickery!

151
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,400
There she is, sir!

152
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:23,100
I can see that!

153
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:29,500
Whole bloomin' world can see that!

154
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:32,700
POLICE WHISTLES
AND SHOUTS FROM THE CROWD

155
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:41,100
Fantastic!

156
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:49,800
Did you see where it came from?
Ah! The wag reveals himself, does he?

157
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:51,700
I trust you're satisfied, sir!

158
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:53,500
Oi! Leave her alone.

159
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56,700
Doctor! I'll get them. Be careful!

160
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:59,800
Did it say anything? Can it speak?
I'm the Doctor, by the way.

161
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:01,700
Doctor? You look more like a navvy.

162
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:04,300
What's wrong with this jumper?

163
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:06,600
What are you doing?
A tragedy, miss.

164
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:09,300
Don't worry yourself,
me and the master'll deal with it.

165
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:13,400
Fact is, this poor lady's been
taken with a brain-fever and we
have to get her to the infirmary.

166
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,900
She's cold. She's dead.

167
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,200
Oh, my God, what did you do to her?

168
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:23,200
MUFFLED SHOUTS

169
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,800
What did you do that for?

170
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:30,600
She's seen too much!

171
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:32,500
Get her in the hearse! Legs!

172
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,800
Gas.

173
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:39,400
It's made of gas.

174
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:52,400
Rose! You're not escaping me, sir!

175
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,400
What do you know about
that hob-goblin?

176
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:59,500
Projection on glass, I suppose.
Who put you up to it?

177
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,100
Yeah, mate, not now, thanks.

178
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:04,000
Oi! You! Follow that hearse!

179
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:05,800
Can't do that, sir. Why not?

180
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:09,200
I'll give you a very good reason
why not. Because this is my coach.

181
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:11,000
Well, get in, then!

182
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:12,900
Move!

183
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,100
You're losing them!
Everything in order, Mr Dickens?

184
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:20,300
No, it is not! What did he say?

185
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,700
I am not without a sense of humour...

186
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,200
Dickens? Yes. Charles Dickens?

187
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:28,900
Yes! THE Charles Dickens?
Should I remove the gentleman, sir?

188
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,900
You're brilliant, you are!
Completely, 100% brilliant!
I've read 'em all!

189
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:37,700
Great Expectations, Oliver Twist
and what's the one with the ghost?
Christmas Carol?

190
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:40,900
No, the one with the trains.
The Signalman - terrifying!

191
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,700
The best short story ever written!

192
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:45,400
You're a genius. Do
you want me to get rid of him, sir?

193
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:47,200
Er, no, I think he can stay.

194
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:50,200
Honestly, Charles... er, can I call
you Charles? I'm such a big fan.

195
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:54,400
Eh, you're a what? A big what?
Fan. Number one fan, that's me!

196
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,800
How exactly are you a "fan"?

197
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:59,900
In what way do you resemble
a means of keeping oneself cool?

198
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,900
No, it means fanatic. Mind you, that
American bit in Martin Chuzzlewit,
what's that about?

199
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,700
Was that just padding or what?
It's rubbish.
I thought you were my fan?

200
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,900
Oh, well,
if you can't take criticism...

201
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,400
Do the death of Little Nell.
It cracks me up. No! Sorry!

202
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:15,000
Forget about that. Come on! Faster!

203
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:21,000
Who exactly is in that hearse?

204
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:24,600
My friend. She's only 19
and it's my fault. She's in
my care, now she's in danger.

205
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:27,200
Why are we wasting my time
talking about dry old books?

206
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:29,300
This is much more important. Driver!

207
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:31,700
Be swift! The chase is on! Yes, sir!

208
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:34,000
Attaboy, Charlie.
Nobody calls me Charlie.

209
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:37,300
The ladies do. How do you know that?
I told you! I'm your number one...

210
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:39,100
Number one fan.

211
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:46,200
The poor girl's still alive, sir,
what are we going to do with her?

212
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:47,500
I don't know!

213
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,700
I didn't plan any of this, did I?

214
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:52,700
Is it my fault
if the dead won't stay dead?

215
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:55,400
Then whose fault is it, sir?

216
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:57,400
Why is this happening to us?

217
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:12,300
I did the Bishop a favour once.

218
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:16,800
Made his nephew look like a cherub
even though he'd been
a fortnight in the weir.

219
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:20,500
Hey, perhaps he'll do us
an exorcism on the cheap!

220
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:21,900
KNOCK AT DOOR

221
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,200
Say I'm not in.
Tell 'em we're closed.

222
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:25,900
Just, just, get rid of 'em.

223
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,900
GHOSTLY SIGHS AND WHISPERINGS

224
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:46,800
I'm sorry sir, we're closed.
Nonsense, since when did
an undertaker keep office hours?

225
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:49,700
The dead don't die on schedule,
I demand to see your master.

226
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,400
He's not in, sir.

227
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:54,300
Don't lie to me, child,
summon the master!

228
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:57,800
I'm awfully sorry, Mr Dickens,
but the master is indisposed.

229
00:15:57,900 --> 00:15:59,800
Having trouble with your gas?

230
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:03,400
What the Shakespeare is going on?

231
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:11,300
Are you all right?

232
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:17,400
You're kidding me, yeah?
You're just kidding.

233
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:19,600
You are kidding me, aren't you?

234
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:21,100
OK, not kidding.

235
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:28,800
You're not allowed inside, sir.
There's something inside the walls.

236
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,300
The gas pipes.

237
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:36,400
Something's living inside the gas.

238
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:44,300
Let me out! Open the door!

239
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:46,700
That's her! Please, let me out!

240
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:52,900
How dare you, sir! This is my house.

241
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:57,300
I told you...
Let me out, somebody open the door!

242
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:02,900
Open the door!

243
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,700
I think this is my dance.

244
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:17,600
It's a prank. Must be.
We're under some mesmeric influence.

245
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:19,200
No, the dead are walking.

246
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:21,500
Hi. Hi. Who's your friend?

247
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:23,200
Charles Dickens.

248
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:26,900
OK. My name's the Doctor.
Who are you, then? What do you want?

249
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,100
Failing! Open the rift. We're dying.

250
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,900
Trapped in this form.

251
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,700
Cannot sustain. Help us.

252
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,500
IT SCREAMS

253
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:52,300
First you drug me,
then you kidnap me, and don't think
I didn't feel your hands

254
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:55,700
having a wander, you dirty old man.
I won't be spoken to like this.

255
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:57,900
Then you sent me
in a room full of zombies!

256
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:02,500
And if that ain't enough,
you swan off and leave me to die!
So come on! Talk!

257
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,300
It's not my fault, it's this house!

258
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:08,400
It always had a reputation.

259
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:10,300
Haunted.

260
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:14,500
But I never had much bother,
until about three months back.
And then the stiffs...

261
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:17,900
The, erm...

262
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,000
the dear departed
started getting restless.

263
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:23,000
Tommyrot!

264
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:24,600
You witnessed it!

265
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:26,800
Can't keep the beggars down, sir.

266
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:28,900
They walk.

267
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,000
And it's the queerest thing,
but they hang onto scraps...

268
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:34,000
Two sugars, sir,
just how you like it.

269
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:38,000
One old fella, used to be a sexton,
almost walked into his own
memorial service.

270
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:42,000
Just like the old lady,
going to your performance, sir,
just as she'd planned.

271
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:43,900
Morbid fancy.

272
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,500
Oh, Charles, you were there.
I saw nothing but an illusion.

273
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:51,700
If you're going to deny it,
don't waste my time, just shut up.

274
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:57,800
What about the gas? That's new, sir.
I never seen anything like that.

275
00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:02,000
Means it's getting stronger.
The rift's getting wider,
and something's sneaking through.

276
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:04,300
What's the rift?
A weak point in time and space.

277
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,500
A connection between
this place and another.

278
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:08,600
That's the cause of ghost stories,
most of the time.

279
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:12,900
That's how I got the house so cheap,
stories going back generations.

280
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:17,500
Echoes in the dark.
Queer songs in the air.

281
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:20,900
And this feeling, like a shadow

282
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,900
passing over your soul.

283
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Mind you, truth be told,
it's been good for business,

284
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:29,000
just what people expect from
a gloomy old trade like mine.

285
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:37,000
FAINT GHOSTLY WHISPERS

286
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,100
Impossible!

287
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,100
Checking for strings?

288
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,700
Wires... perhaps.

289
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:08,400
There must be some
mechanism behind this fraud.

290
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:10,200
Oh, come on, Charles.

291
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:14,100
All right, I shouldn't have
told you to shut up. I'm sorry.

292
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:18,900
But you've got one of the best minds
in the world and you saw those gas
creatures. I cannot accept that.

293
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:23,300
And what does the human body do,
when it decomposes? It breaks down.
Produces gas.

294
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:27,200
Perfect home for these gas-things,
they can slip inside,
use it as a vehicle.

295
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:30,100
Just like your driver and his coach.
Stop it!

296
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:34,600
Can it be that I have the world
entirely wrong?

297
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:37,200
Not wrong. There's just more
to learn.

298
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:39,900
I've always
railed against the fantasists!

299
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:44,600
Oh, I loved an illusion -
revelled in them, but that's
exactly what they were, illusions.

300
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:48,800
The real world is something else.

301
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:52,300
I dedicated myself to that -
injustices,

302
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,700
the great social causes.

303
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:57,700
I hoped that I was a force for good.

304
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:01,900
Now, you tell me
that the real world

305
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,700
is a realm of spectres
and jack o'lanterns.

306
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:08,500
In which case...

307
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:12,000
have I wasted my brief span here,
Doctor?

308
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:15,800
Has it all been for nothing?

309
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:22,900
Please, miss, you shouldn't
be helping, it's not right.

310
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,300
Don't be daft, I bet
Sneed works you to death.

311
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:31,900
How much do you get paid?

312
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,400
Eight pound a year, miss.
How much? I know!

313
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:37,000
I would've been happy with six.

314
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:42,400
So did you even go to school,
or what?

315
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:45,700
Of course I did,
what do you think I am, an urchin?

316
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:49,600
I went every Sunday,
nice and proper.

317
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:51,100
What, once a week?!

318
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:54,600
We did sums and everything.

319
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:56,500
To be honest,

320
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:59,500
I hated every second. Me, too!

321
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,800
Don't tell anyone...

322
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:09,900
but one week I didn't go and I ran
down the Heath, all on my own.

323
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:14,200
I did plenty of that,
I used to go round
the shops with my mate, Shareen.

324
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:15,900
And we used to go and look at boys.

325
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,900
Well, I don't know
much about that, miss.

326
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,400
Oh, come on,
times haven't changed that much.

327
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:26,600
I bet you've done the same.
I don't think so, miss.

328
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:29,100
Gwyneth, you can tell me.

329
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,900
I bet you've got
your eye on someone.

330
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:35,300
I suppose, there is one lad.

331
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:40,400
The butcher's boy,
he comes by every Tuesday.

332
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:42,000
Such a lovely smile on him.

333
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:44,300
I like a nice smile.

334
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:47,100
Good smile, nice bum.

335
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,700
Well, I have never heard the like!

336
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:55,400
Ask him out. Give him a cup of
tea or something, that's a start.

337
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:58,800
I swear,
it's the strangest thing, miss.

338
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:03,100
You've got all the clothes
and the breeding. But you talk
like some sort of wild thing.

339
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:06,600
Maybe I am.

340
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:09,800
Maybe that's a good thing.

341
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:13,500
You need a bit more
in your life than Mr Sneed.

342
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:16,600
Oh, now, that's not fair.

343
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:18,700
He's not so bad, old Sneed.

344
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:23,500
He was very kind to me to take
me in, cos I lost my mam and
dad to the 'flu when I was 12.

345
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:25,200
Oh, I'm sorry.

346
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:30,900
Thank you, miss. But I'll
be with them again, one day.

347
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,800
Sitting with them in Paradise.

348
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:35,500
I shall be so blessed.

349
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,100
They're waiting for me.

350
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:40,400
Maybe your dad's up there
waiting for you too, miss.

351
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:41,900
Maybe.

352
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:46,100
Um, who told you he was dead?

353
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:52,000
I dunno, must've been the Doctor.

354
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:54,600
My father died years back.

355
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:57,800
You've been thinking about
him lately. More than ever.

356
00:23:57,900 --> 00:23:59,300
Suppose so.

357
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:03,100
How do you know all this?

358
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:06,500
Mr Sneed says I think too much,

359
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:09,100
I'm all alone down here.

360
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,100
I bet you've got dozens of servants.

361
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,700
No, no servants where I'm from.

362
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:15,400
And you've come such a long way.

363
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:19,200
What makes you think so?

364
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,300
You're from London.

365
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:26,700
I've seen London in drawings,
but never like that,

366
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:30,100
all those people rushing about.

367
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:33,400
Half-naked, for shame.

368
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:36,100
And the noise...

369
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:40,300
and the metal boxes racing past...

370
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:44,900
and the birds in the sky!
No, no, they're metal as well.

371
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,200
Metal birds with people in them.

372
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:50,200
People are flying.

373
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:52,100
And you. You've flown so far.

374
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:53,900
Further than anyone.

375
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,000
The things you've seen.

376
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:59,500
The darkness.

377
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,000
The big bad wolf.

378
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:06,700
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, miss.
It's all right. I can't help it.

379
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:09,600
Ever since I was a little girl,
my mam said I had the sight.

380
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:11,900
She told me to hide it.
But it's getting stronger.

381
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,500
More powerful. Is that right?

382
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:16,800
All the time, sir.

383
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:21,000
Every night,

384
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:23,100
voices in my head.

385
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:26,500
You grew up on top of the rift.
You're part of it.

386
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:29,600
You're the key.
I've tried to make sense of it, sir.

387
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:31,500
Consulted with...

388
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:36,900
spiritualists, table-rappers,
all sorts. Well, that should help.

389
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,300
You can show us what to do.

390
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:41,200
What to do where, sir?

391
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:43,300
We're going to have a seance.

392
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:51,100
This is how Madame Mortlock summons
those from the land of mists,
down in Butetown.

393
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:54,800
Come. We must all join hands.
I can't take part in this.

394
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:57,200
Humbug? Come on. Open mind.

395
00:25:57,300 --> 00:26:01,500
This is precisely the sort of cheap
mummery I strive to unmask.

396
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,100
Seances!

397
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:09,800
Nothing but luminous tambourines
and a squeeze-box concealed between
the knees. This girl knows nothing!

398
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:11,500
Now, don't antagonise her.

399
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:13,200
I love a happy medium.

400
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:15,300
I can't believe you just said that.

401
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:17,400
Come on. We might need you.

402
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,400
Good man.

403
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:24,200
Now, Gwyneth.

404
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:25,700
Reach out.

405
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:30,900
Speak to us.

406
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:35,100
Are you there?

407
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:38,300
Spirits, come.

408
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:41,500
Speak to us
that we may relieve your burden.

409
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:45,000
DISTANT DISTORTED VOICES

410
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:46,300
Can you hear that?

411
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:50,400
Nothing can happen,
this is sheer folly. Look at her.

412
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:52,700
I see them!

413
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:55,200
I feel them!

414
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:09,400
What's it saying?
It can't get through the rift.

415
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:12,200
Gwyneth, it's not controlling you,
you're controlling it.

416
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:14,300
Now look deep. Allow them through.
I can't.

417
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:18,700
Yes, you can. Just believe it.
I have faith in you, Gwyneth.

418
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:20,200
Make the link.

419
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,800
Yes!

420
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:33,500
Great God!

421
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,800
Spirits from the other side!

422
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:38,300
The other side of the universe.

423
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:40,300
Pity us!

424
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:42,100
Pity the Gelth!

425
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:44,300
There is so little time. Help us!

426
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:46,700
What do you want us to do? The rift.

427
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:48,300
Take the girl to the rift.

428
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,400
Make the bridge. What for?

429
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:53,000
We are so very few.

430
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:54,900
The last of our kind.

431
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,300
We face extinction!
Why, what happened?

432
00:27:57,400 --> 00:28:00,600
Once we had
a physical form, like you.

433
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:02,900
But then the War came.

434
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,700
- War? What war?
- The Time War.

435
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:08,900
The whole universe convulsed.

436
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:16,300
The Time War raged,
invisible to smaller species
but devastating to higher forms.

437
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:18,500
Our bodies wasted away.

438
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:23,300
We're trapped in this gaseous state.

439
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:25,400
So that's why you need the corpses.

440
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:27,700
We want to stand tall.

441
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:29,600
To feel the sunlight.

442
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:31,500
To live again.

443
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:36,300
We need a physical form
and your dead are abandoned.

444
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:38,900
They go to waste. Give them to us.

445
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,900
But we can't. Why not?

446
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,700
It's not... I mean,

447
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:45,500
it's not... Not decent? Not polite?
It could save their lives.

448
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:47,600
Open the rift.

449
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:50,100
Let the Gelth through.

450
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:52,600
We're dying. Help us.

451
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:54,400
Pity the Gelth!

452
00:28:57,500 --> 00:28:59,100
Gwyneth!

453
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:02,600
All true.

454
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:07,700
It's all true.

455
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:19,500
It's all right. You just sleep.

456
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:22,000
But my angels, miss!

457
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:24,300
They came, didn't they?
They need me.

458
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:26,900
Yes, Gwyneth.
You're their only chance of survival

459
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,300
I told you, leave her alone.

460
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:31,500
She's exhausted
and she's not fighting your battles.

461
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,800
Now, drink this.

462
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:39,000
But what did you say, Doctor?
Explain it again.

463
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:41,500
What are they? Aliens.

464
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:43,600
Like, foreigners, you mean?

465
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:45,600
Pretty foreign, yeah. From up there.

466
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:51,100
Brecon? Close. And they've been
trying to get through from Brecon
to Cardiff but the road's blocked.

467
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:55,500
Only a few can get through. Even
then, they're weak. They can only
test-drive the bodies for so long.

468
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,800
Then they have to revert to
gas and hide in the pipes.

469
00:29:57,900 --> 00:29:59,700
Which is why they need the girl?

470
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:02,400
They're not having her.
But she can help.

471
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:06,300
Living on the rift she's become
part of it. She can open it up,
make a bridge and let them through.

472
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:11,500
Incredible. Ghosts that are not
ghosts but beings from another world.

473
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:16,100
Who can only exist
in our realm by inhabiting cadavers.

474
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:17,700
Good system. It might work.

475
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:21,800
You can't let them run
around inside of dead people!

476
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:23,400
Why not? It's like recycling.

477
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:26,000
Seriously though, you can't.
Seriously though, I can.

478
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:27,500
But it's just wrong.

479
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:31,800
Those bodies were living people. We
should respect them, even in death.

480
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:33,300
Do you carry a donor card?

481
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:35,900
It's different, that's...
It is different, yeah.

482
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,700
It's a different morality.
Get used to it. Or go home.

483
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:42,700
You heard what they said,
time's short.

484
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:46,100
I can't worry about a few corpses
when the last
of the Gelth could be dying.

485
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:49,500
I don't care, they're not using her.
Don't I get a say, miss?

486
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:52,400
Well, yes... no.

487
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:58,300
You don't understand what's going
on. You would say that, miss, cos
that's very clear inside your head.

488
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:01,800
That you think I'm stupid.
That's not fair. It's true though.

489
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:08,700
Things might be very different
where you're from, but here and now,
I know my own mind.

490
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:11,300
And the angels need me.

491
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:13,800
Doctor? What do I have to do?

492
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:18,300
You don't HAVE to do anything.
They've been singing to me
since I was a child.

493
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:21,100
Sent by my mam on holy mission,

494
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:23,900
so tell me.

495
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,700
We need to find the rift.

496
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:29,700
This house is on a weak-spot,
so there must be a spot
that's weaker than any other.

497
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:32,600
Mr Sneed, what's the weakest
part of this house?

498
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:35,500
The place where
most of the ghosts have been seen?

499
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:38,600
That would be the morgue.

500
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:41,000
No chance you were going
to say gazebo, is there?

501
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:54,800
Huh!

502
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:56,800
Talk about bleak house.

503
00:31:56,900 --> 00:32:01,200
The thing is, Doctor,
the Gelth don't succeed,
cos I know they don't.

504
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:04,600
I know for a fact that corpses
weren't walking round in 1869.

505
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:09,100
Time's in flux, changing every
second. Your cosy little
world could be rewritten like that.

506
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:10,800
Nothing is safe. Remember that.

507
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:15,300
Nothing. Doctor,
I think the room is getting colder.

508
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:23,500
Here they come. You've come to help!

509
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:25,700
Praise the Doctor! Praise him.

510
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:27,200
Promise you won't hurt her.

511
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:31,100
Hurry! Please! So little time.
Pity the Gelth!

512
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:34,000
I'll take you somewhere else
after the transfer.

513
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:36,200
Somewhere you can build
proper bodies.

514
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:38,800
This isn't a permanent solution,
all right?

515
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:42,100
My angels! I can help them live.

516
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:45,800
OK, where's the weak point?
Here, beneath the arch!

517
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:48,100
Beneath the arch.

518
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:50,500
You don't have to do this.

519
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:54,500
My angels. Establish the bridge!
Reach out to the void.
Let us through!

520
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:56,700
Yes!

521
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:58,300
I can see you.

522
00:32:58,400 --> 00:32:59,900
I can see you! Come!

523
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,900
Bridgehead establishing. Come to me.

524
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,400
Come to this world. Poor lost souls.

525
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:09,500
It has begun! The bridge is made.

526
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:15,100
She has given herself
to the Gelth!

527
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:16,800
Rather a lot of them, eh?

528
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:20,600
The bridge is open. We descend.

529
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:27,000
The Gelth will
come through in force.

530
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:29,900
You said
that you were few in number!

531
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,200
A few billion!
And all of us in need of corpses!

532
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,900
Now, Gwyneth,

533
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,700
stop this.

534
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:43,100
Listen to your master!

535
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:48,500
This has gone far enough,
stop dabbling, child, and leave
these things alone, I beg of you.

536
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:50,900
Mr Sneed, get back! Don't go near.

537
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:08,800
I think it's going
a little bit wrong.

538
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:11,700
I have joined the legions
of the Gelth.

539
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:18,000
- Come, march with us.
- Oh, Glory!

540
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:24,200
We need bodies. All of you, dead.

541
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:26,300
The human race, dead.

542
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:28,400
Gwyneth, stop them!
Send them back, now!

543
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:30,200
Three more bodies! Convert them!

544
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:32,100
Make them vessels for the Gelth!

545
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:35,000
Doctor, I can't! I'm sorry.

546
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:38,900
This new world of yours,
it's too much for me.

547
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:42,000
I'm so...

548
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:44,100
Give yourself to glory.

549
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:47,300
Sacrifice your lives to the Gelth.

550
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:49,300
I trusted you. I pitied you!

551
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:53,600
We don't want your pity! We want
this world and all its flesh.

552
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:55,300
Not while I'm alive.

553
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:57,300
Then live no more.

554
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:21,300
But I can't die. Tell me I can't.

555
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:25,300
I haven't even been born yet,
it's impossible for me to die.

556
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:27,500
Isn't it?

557
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:29,500
I'm sorry.

558
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:38,700
Failing! Atmosphere hostile!

559
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:40,500
Gas!

560
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:43,100
The gas!

561
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:47,100
But it's 1869, how can I die now?

562
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:50,700
Time isn't a straight line,
it can twist into any shape.

563
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:53,500
You can be born in the 20th century
and die in the 19th.

564
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:55,600
And it's all my fault.

565
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:58,300
I brought you here.

566
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:00,900
It's not your fault.

567
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,300
I wanted to come. What about me?

568
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:05,500
I saw the fall of Troy.
World War Five.

569
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:08,400
I pushed boxes
at the Boston Tea Party.

570
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:10,400
Now I'm gonna die in a dungeon,

571
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:13,300
in Cardiff!

572
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:15,400
And it's not just dying.

573
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:18,600
We're gonna become one of them.

574
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:33,700
We'll go down fighting, yeah?

575
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:36,300
Yeah. Together? Yeah.

576
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:41,100
I'm so glad I met you.

577
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:44,000
Me, too.

578
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:45,700
Doctor! Doctor!

579
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:50,600
Turn off the flame, turn up the gas.
Now fill the room! All of it, now.

580
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:53,000
What are you doing? Turn it all on!

581
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:54,700
Flood the place!

582
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:57,900
Brilliant, gas!
What, so we choke to death instead?

583
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,600
Am I correct, Doctor?

584
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:03,400
These creatures are gaseous.

585
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:09,300
Fill the room with gas. It'll draw
them out of the host, suck them into
the air, like poison from a wound.

586
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:10,900
I hope...

587
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,200
Oh, lord!

588
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:16,300
I hope that this theory
will be validated... soon.

589
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,000
If not immediately.

590
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:19,900
Plenty more.

591
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:32,900
It's working!

592
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,500
Gwyneth, send them back.
They lied, they're not angels!

593
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:40,500
Liars? Look at them!

594
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:44,500
If your mother and father could look
down and see this,
they'd tell you the same.

595
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:47,000
They'd give you the strength.
Now send them back!

596
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:50,300
Can't breathe. Charles, get her out.

597
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:52,600
I'm not leaving her.
They're too strong.

598
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:54,200
Remember that world you saw?

599
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:55,900
Rose's world? All those people.

600
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:59,200
None of it will exist unless you
send them back through the rift!

601
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:02,100
I can't send them back.

602
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:04,600
But I can hold them.

603
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:06,900
Hold them in this place.
Hold them here.

604
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:10,800
Get out.

605
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:12,500
You can't! Leave this place.

606
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:14,100
Rose, get out, go now.

607
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:17,300
I won't leave her while
she's still in danger. Now go!

608
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:19,400
Come on. Leave that to me.

609
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:33,800
I'm sorry.

610
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,400
Thank you.

611
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:12,300
She didn't make it.

612
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:16,300
I'm sorry. She closed the rift.

613
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:19,000
At such a cost.

614
00:39:19,100 --> 00:39:20,700
The poor child.

615
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:23,700
I did try, Rose,
but Gwyneth was already dead.

616
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:26,500
She had been for at least
five minutes. What do you mean?

617
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:32,400
I think she was dead from
the minute she stood in that arch.

618
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:36,900
But she can't have, she spoke to us,
she helped us, she saved us.

619
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,700
How could she have done that?

620
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:45,700
There are more things
in Heaven and Earth than
are dreamt of in your philosophy.

621
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:48,400
Even for you, Doctor.

622
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:53,900
She saved the world.

623
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
A servant girl.

624
00:39:56,100 --> 00:39:57,500
And no-one will ever know.

625
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:14,200
Right then, Charlie boy,
I've just got to go into my, erm...

626
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:16,000
shed.

627
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:17,700
Won't be long.

628
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:20,000
What are you going to do now?

629
00:40:20,100 --> 00:40:23,300
I shall take the mail-coach back to
London, quite literally post-haste.

630
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:26,500
This is no time for me
to be on my own.

631
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:30,100
I shall spend Christmas with my
family and make amends to them.

632
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:34,100
After all I've learnt tonight,
there can be nothing more vital.

633
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:36,900
You've cheered up. Exceedingly!

634
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,900
This morning, I thought I knew
everything in the world.

635
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
Now I know I've just started.

636
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:46,300
All these huge
and wonderful notions, Doctor!

637
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:48,300
I am inspired,
I must write about them!

638
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:50,600
Do you think that's wise?

639
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:52,100
I shall be subtle, at first.

640
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:56,200
The Mystery Of Edwin Drood
still lacks an ending.

641
00:40:56,300 --> 00:41:00,600
Perhaps the killer
was not the boy's uncle.

642
00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:03,700
Perhaps he was not of this earth!

643
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:09,200
The Mystery Of Edwin Drood
And The Blue Elementals!

644
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:11,300
I can spread the word,
tell the truth!

645
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:13,200
Good luck with it.

646
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:15,100
Nice to meet you, fantastic.

647
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:17,700
Bye, then. And thanks.

648
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:21,000
Oh, my dear!

649
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:23,000
How modern.

650
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:29,700
Thank you. But I don't understand,
in what way is this goodbye?

651
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:33,500
Where are you going?
You'll see. In the shed.

652
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:37,100
Upon my soul, Doctor, it's one
riddle after another with you.

653
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:43,800
But after all these revelations,
there's one mystery
you still haven't explained.

654
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:45,900
Answer me this.

655
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,600
Who are you?

656
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:53,700
Just a friend. Passing through.

657
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:57,000
But you have such knowledge
of future times.

658
00:41:57,100 --> 00:42:00,600
I don't wish to impose on you
but I must ask you,

659
00:42:00,700 --> 00:42:04,300
my books... Doctor.

660
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:10,100
Do they last? Oh, yes. For how long?

661
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:11,700
Forever.

662
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:16,900
Right.

663
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
Shed. Come on, Rose.

664
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:20,600
What? In the box?

665
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:22,400
Both of you?

666
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:24,100
Down, boy.

667
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:26,400
See ya.

668
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:32,300
Doesn't that change history,
if he writes about blue ghosts?

669
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:34,100
In a week's time, it's 1870.

670
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:36,200
And that's the year he dies. Sorry.

671
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:37,800
He'll never get to tell his story.

672
00:42:37,900 --> 00:42:40,200
Oh, no. He was so nice.

673
00:42:40,300 --> 00:42:43,500
But in your time, he was already
dead. We've brought him back to life

674
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:46,900
and he's more alive now than
he's ever been. Old Charlie Boy.

675
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,400
Let's give him one last surprise.

676
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:51,900
WHOOSH OF TARDIS DISAPPEARING

677
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:07,800
HE CHUCKLES TO HIMSELF

678
00:43:15,100 --> 00:43:18,600
Merry Christmas, sir.
Merry Christmas to you!

679
00:43:18,700 --> 00:43:20,400
God bless us.

680
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:21,900
Every one.

681
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:38,600
Big Ben destroyed as a UFO
crash lands in Central London.

682
00:43:44,900 --> 00:43:49,300
What is it then? Are they
invading? Funny way to invade,
putting the world on red alert.

683
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:52,100
My God, I'll put this country
