1
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:07,500
There's a strange man in my bedroom.

2
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:09,700
No.

3
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:11,700
Mum? I'm in town!

4
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:15,700
No, go home! Go home right now.
Darling you're breaking up. Mum!

5
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:21,200
Right then, I'll be off.

6
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:25,200
Unless. . .I dunno,
you could come with me.

7
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:27,500
Is it always this dangerous? Yeah.

8
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:03,000
How long have I been gone?
About 12 hours.

9
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:08,700
Oh. . . ! Right, I won't be long.
I just want to see my mum.

10
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:13,000
What you gonna tell her? I dunno.
That I've been to the year five
billion and only been gone, what,

11
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,000
12 hours? No, I'll just tell her
I spent the night at Shereen's.

12
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:19,900
See you later.

13
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:21,800
Don't you disappear.

14
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:54,800
I'm back! I was with Shereen. She
got all upset again. . . Are you in?

15
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:57,100
What's been goin' on?
How've you been?

16
00:01:57,100 --> 00:02:02,300
What's that face for?
It's not the first time
I've stayed out all night.

17
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:10,900
It's you.

18
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:12,600
Course it's me.

19
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:15,900
Oh, my God, it's you. Oh, my God.

20
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:30,000
I-It's not 12 hours, it's 12 months.
You've been gone a whole year.

21
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,500
Sorry!

22
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:15,400
The hours I sat here - days and
weeks and months - all on my own!

23
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:19,500
I thought you were dead,
and where were you? "Travelling"!

24
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:22,100
What the hell's it mean, travelling?

25
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:25,900
That's no sort of answer!
 .You ask her, she won't tell me.

26
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:27,600
That's all she says, "travelling".

27
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:32,700
That's what I was doing. With
your passport still in the drawer?
It's just one lie after another!

28
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:35,200
I meant to phone, I really did.
I just. . .

29
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:40,100
I forgot. For a year? You forgot for
a year, and I'm left sitting here? !

30
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:44,300
I just don't believe you! Why won't
you tell me where you've been?

31
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:49,200
Actually, it's my fault. I sort of. . .
employed Rose as my companion.

32
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:53,100
When you say companion, is
this a sexual relationship? No! No!

33
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:57,900
Then what is it? Because you. . . ! You
waltz in here, all charm and smiles,

34
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:00,300
and the next thing I know, she
vanishes off the face of the Earth!

35
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:05,400
How old are you then, 40, 45? What,
did you find her on the Internet,

36
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:09,000
go online and pretend you're
a doctor(? ) I am a doctor. Prove it.

37
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,700
Stitch this.

38
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:11,800
Ow!

39
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:14,100
(Oh-h!)

40
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:20,400
Did you think about me at all?
I did, all the time, but. . .

41
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:24,700
One phone call.
Just to know that you were alive.

42
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:29,900
I'm sorry, I really am.

43
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:35,200
But d'you know, what terrifies me
is that you still can't say.

44
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:42,000
What happened to you, Rose?
What can be so bad that you can't
tell me, sweetheart? Where were you?

EMERGENCY SIRENS PASS

46
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:53,800
I can't tell her.
I can't even begin.

47
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:59,900
She's never going to forgive me.
And I missed a year. Was it good?
Middling. You're so useless.

48
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:05,500
Well, if it's this much trouble,
are you gonna stay here now? I dunno.

49
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:09,100
Can't do that to her again, though.
Well, she's not coming with us.

50
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:12,900
No chance! I don't do families.

51
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:18,500
She slapped you! 900 years of time
and space - I've never been slapped
by someone's mother. Your face.

52
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:21,600
It hurt! You're so gay!

53
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,400
When you say 900 years. . .

54
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:27,000
That's my age. You're 900 years old.

55
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,200
Yeah.

56
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:32,500
My mum was right.
That is one hell of an age gap.

57
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:39,500
Every conversation
with you just goes mental.

58
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:43,500
There's no-one else I can talk to!
I've seen all that stuff, up there,

59
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:49,100
the size of it, and I can't say
a word. Aliens and spaceships
and things. . .

60
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:53,600
and I'm the only person on
planet Earth who knows they exist.

61
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:56,600
PAAAAAARP!

Ah, just my luck.

00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:19,300
Stay BACK, please. Back, thank you.

68
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:24,200
It's blocked off!

69
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:28,000
We're miles from the centre.
The city must be gridlocked.

70
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:30,000
The whole of London
must be closing down.

71
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:35,600
I know! I can't believe I'm here to
see this. This is fantastic! Did you
know this was gonna happen? Nope!

72
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:39,500
D'you recognise the ship? Nope!
D'you know why it crashed? Nope!

73
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:44,700
So glad I've got you(!) Bet you are!
This is why I travel, Rose. History
happening right in front of us!

74
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:50,200
Well, let's go and see it.
Never mind the traffic, we've
got the Tardis. Hmm. Better not.

75
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:54,700
With one spaceship in the middle of
London, I don't wanna shove another
on top. Yeah. . .

76
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:58,100
but yours looks like a big blue box.
No-one'd notice. You'd be surprised.

77
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:03,200
Emergency like this, all kinds of
people will be watching. Trust me,
the Tardis stays where it is.

78
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:08,200
So history is happening, and we're
stuck here. Yes, we are. . .This has
gotta be Ken Livingstone, innit. . . ?

79
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:10,700
We COULD do what everyone else does.

80
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,500
Watch it on TV.

81
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:21,700

a body's been found in the wreckage,

'A body has been found inside

It's not a hoax or a dummy, or. . ?
I've x-rayed the skull.

No-one could make this up.

Until they arrive,
get that out of sight.

126
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:44,100
Excuse me, sir. I know it's a state
of emergency and there's a lot
of rumour flying around, but. . .

127
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:47,500
is it true what they're saying?
About the Prime Minister?

128
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:05,000
Mystery surrounds the whereabouts
of the Prime Minister. He's not been
seen since the emergency began.

129
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,700
The opposition are criticising
his lack of leadership. . . Hold on.

130
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:16,100
Oh, that's Joseph Green,
MP for Hartley Dale.

131
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:22,100
He's Chairman of the Parliamentary
Commission on the Monitoring of Sugar
Standards in Exported Confectionery.

132
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:25,600
With respect, hardly
the most important person right now.

133
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:31,700
Indra Ganesh, sir, Junior Secretary
with the MOD. I'll be your liaison.
Where the hell is he?

00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:35,500
If we could talk in private, sir?
Follow me upstairs. Excuse me. . .

00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:41,400
Harriet Jones, MP for Flydale North.
I'm sorry, can't it wait? But I did
have an appointment at 3.15. Yes.

136
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:46,500
Then a spaceship crashed
in the middle of London. I think
the schedule might have changed(!)

137
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:53,900
You've heard about the body, sir?
Never mind that. Where is he?
Where's the Prime Minister?

138
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:57,500
No-one knows, he's disappeared.
I have to inform you,

139
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:02,500
with the city gridlocked and the
Cabinet stranded outside London, you
become Acting Prime Minister. Now.

140
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:05,200
Oh, Lord! Oh, hold on.
PHRRRRT!

141
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:08,900

Margaret Blaine, she's with MI5
There's no more information sir.

143
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:23,200
I personally escorted the PM from
the Cabinet Room to his car. This is
Oliver Charles, Transport Liaison.

144
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:28,900
The car's disappeared.
There's no record of it, sir.
Literally vanished. Right - inside,

145
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:32,100
tell me everything. Er, sir. . .

146
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:39,300
Emergency protocols. The actions
to be taken by the Government
in the event of an alien incursion.

147
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:40,800
Right. Good.

148
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:42,200
PHRRRT!
Blimey!

149
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,600
Pardon me.

150
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:45,800
Get to work, eh?

151
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:24,000
DOGS BARK

152
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:35,400
And where d'you think you're going?
Nowhere. It's. . .just
a bit human in there for me.

153
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:40,700
History's happened. They're talking
about where to buy dodgy top-up cards
half-price. I'm only off on a wander.

154
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:46,000
Right. A spaceship on the Thames,
and you're just wandering(? ) Nothing
to do with me! It's not an invasion.

155
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:52,100
That was a genuine crash-landing.
Angle of descent, colour of smoke,
everything. It was perfect. So?

156
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:57,200
So maybe this is it. First contact.
The day mankind officially comes
into contact with an alien race.

157
00:14:57,300 --> 00:15:02,100
I'm not interfering. You've GOT to
handle this on your own.
And the human race finally grows up!

158
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:08,000
Just this morning, you were
all tiny and small and made of clay!
Now you can expand!

159
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:14,100
You don't need me. Go and celebrate
history. Spend time with your mum.
Promise you won't disappear.

160
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,300
Tell you what.

161
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:23,900
Tardis key. About time you had one.
See you later.

162
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:28,800
MUSIC STARTS UP

163
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:35,300
MUSIC AND LAUGHTER

164
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:44,000
WOMAN: Oi, gorgeous, come
back and join the party!

165
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:58,400
Oh, my God!

166
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:28,400
Oi! Doctor!

167
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:29,600
DOCTOR!

168
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:22,800
I bet no-one's brought you a coffee.

169
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:25,100
Thank you. Pleasure.

170
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:27,600
You still can't go in.

171
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:31,000
Damn, you've seen through
my cunning plan.

172
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:35,600
Look, I'm sorry, it's impossible.
Not even for two minutes?

173
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:39,700
I don't get many chances
to walk these corridors,

174
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:42,400
I'm hardly one of the "babes",
just a faithful backbencher.

175
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:47,500
And I know we've had a brave new
world land right on our doorstep,
and that's wonderful.

176
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:52,200
I think that's. . .probably wonderful,
nevertheless, ordinary life
keeps ticking away.

177
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:54,800
I need to enter this paper.

178
00:17:55,700 --> 00:18:02,000
Oh, Mr Green sir, I know you're
busy, but could you put this
on the next Cabinet agenda?

179
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:05,500
What is it? Cottage hospitals.
I've worked out a system

180
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:09,300
where cottage hospitals need not be
excluded from Centres of Excellence.

181
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:13,000
You see, my mother's in the Flydale
Infirmary, that's my constituency,

182
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:17,000
tiny little place, you wouldn't know
it - but it. . . By all the saints,

183
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,600
get some perspective, woman!
I'm busy!

184
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:34,600
DISTANT THUD ECHOES

185
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:40,500
LOUDER THUD

186
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:46,100
ANOTHER THUD

187
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:53,600
THUD AND METALLIC CLANK

188
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:01,800
REGULAR THUDS CONTINUE

189
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:17,400
LOUD WHIRR
Shhh!

190
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,400
THUDS AND CRASHES

191
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,500
THUMPS BECOME FASTER

192
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:45,900
CHAT AND BANTER

193
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:47,700
THEY FALL SILENT

194
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:59,800
THUDS AND BANGS

195
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:14,800
SHE SCREAMS

196
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:19,600
SCREAM AUDIBLE
Defence plan delta! Come on, MOVE!

197
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:34,700
It's alive. Spread out,
tell the perimeter it's a lockdown.

198
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,800
Oh, my God it's still alive!

199
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,200
Do it!

200
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:44,900
Mick! Terry! Side rooms! Now!

201
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:47,300
Clear!

202
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:52,600
Clear! Keep it moving! Clear!

203
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:54,800
I swear, it was dead. . .

204
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,700
Coma, shock, hibernation, anything. . .
What does it look like?

205
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:00,700
METALLIC CLINK

206
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:03,200
It's still here.

207
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:19,500
METAL CLINKS

208
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:36,200
IT GRUNTS

209
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:38,700
Hello.

210
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:40,700
LOUD SQUEAL

211
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:43,500
Don't shoot!

212
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:48,300
LOUD SCREECHES

213
00:22:58,100 --> 00:23:01,300
What did you do that for?
It was scared!

214
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,900
It was scared!

215
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:10,700
SOFT GROAN

216
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:18,400
MAN OUTSIDE: . .I have the White House
phoning me direct because Downing
Street won't answer their calls!

217
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:23,800
this is outrageous! We haven't even
started the vaccination programme.
This is appalling!

218
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:29,000
The nations of the world are
watching the United Kingdom. Well,
it HAS all been a bit of a shock.

219
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,800
It's the greatest crisis in modern
history, and you've done nothing.

220
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:37,500
Your behaviour's been shameful, sir!
You're supposed to be in charge.
We need leadership.

221
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:39,600
The capital's ground to a halt.

222
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:44,800
Furthermore, we can only assume
the PM's disappearance is the direct
result of hostile alien action,

223
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:48,200
and what've you been doing? Nothing!
Sorry. . .

224
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:50,300
Sorry, ah. . .I thought

225
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,800
I was Prime Minister now.

226
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:57,000
Only by default!
Oh-h-h, that's not fair(!)

227
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,700
I've been having such fun.
You think this is fun?

228
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:02,700
It's a hoot, this job.

229
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:04,800
Honestly, it's super!

230
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:07,300
PHRRRT!
Oh! 'Scuse me.

231
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:08,600
PHRRRT!

232
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:13,700
PHRRRT!
What's going on here?

233
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:20,000
Where's the rest of the Cabinet? Why
haven't they been airlifted in? I
cancelled it. They'd get in the way.

234
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:22,100
PHRRRT!
Oops, there I go.

235
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:25,700
PHRRRT! PHRRRT!
PHRRRT-SQUEAK!
Ooh! And me!

236
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:27,100
THEY GIGGLE

237
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:29,900
I'M. . .shaking my booty.
PHRRRT!

238
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,100
PHRRRT!
Sir!

239
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:37,400
Under Section 5 of the emergency
protocols, it is my duty
to relieve you of command.

240
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:42,400
And by God, I'll put this country
under martial law if I have to.

241
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,900
Ooh I'm scared(!)

242
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:47,300
I mean. . .

243
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:49,700
that's hair-raising.

244
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:53,100
I mean, literally.

245
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,200
Look.

246
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:03,400
THE OTHERS GIGGLE

247
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:10,500
THEY LAUGH

248
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:13,100
SQUELCHY GURGLES AND CRACKLES

249
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,600
HE SCREAMS

250
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:29,700
I just assumed
that's what aliens looked like.

251
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:33,900
You're saying it's an ordinary pig,
from Earth? More like a mermaid.

252
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:39,600
Victorian showmen used to draw the
crowds by gluing the skull of a cat
to a fish, then calling it a mermaid.

253
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:44,400
Now someone's taken a pig,
opened up its brain, stuck bits on.

254
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:48,000
Then they strapped it in that ship,
made it dive-bomb,

255
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,700
it must've been terrified.

256
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:53,500
They've taken this animal
and turned it into a joke.

257
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:57,800
So it's a fake, a pretend,
like the mermaid.

258
00:25:57,800 --> 00:26:02,300
But the technology augmenting its
brain, it's like nothing on Earth.

259
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:05,600
It's alien.
Aliens are faking aliens?

260
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:07,200
Why would they. . . ?

261
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,700
Doctor?

262
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,900
Doctor?

263
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:21,300
TARDIS GRINDS AND GROANS

264
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:29,600
Here's to the Martians!
The Martians!

265
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:39,800
I was gonna come and see ya.
Someone owes Mickey an apology.

266
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:42,400
I'm sorry. Not you.

267
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:46,600
Well, it's not my fault. Be fair,
what was I supposed to think?

268
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:54,600
You disappear, who do they turn to?
Your boyfriend. Five times I was
taken in for questioning. Five!

269
00:26:54,600 --> 00:27:00,400
No evidence. Couldn't be, could
there? And HER whispering round
the estate, pointing the finger.

270
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:05,900
Stuff through my letterbox - all cos
of you. I didn't think I'd be gone
so long. And I waited for you, Rose!

271
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:12,200
12 months, waiting for you and the
doctor to come back. You knew about
the doctor? Why didn't you tell me?

272
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:17,700
Yeah, why not, Rose?
How could I tell her
where you went? Tell me now!

273
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:23,900
I might as well, cos you're stuck
here. The doctor's gone. Just now,
that box thing just faded away.

274
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:28,200
What d'you mean? He's left you.
Some boyfriend he turned out to be.

275
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:40,400
He wouldn't just go. He promised me.
Aw, he's dumped you, Rose, sailed
off into space. How does it feel?

276
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:45,900
Huh? Now you are left behind
with the rest of us earthlings. Get
used to it! But he would've said.

277
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:51,800
What are you two chimps on about?
What's going on? What's this doctor
done now? Huh! He's vamoosed!

278
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:54,400
He's not! Cos he gave me this.

279
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:57,300
He's not my boyfriend, Mickey,
he's better than that.

280
00:27:57,300 --> 00:28:00,000
He's much more important. And he. . .

281
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:08,900
I said so!

282
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,100
Mum! Mum! Go inside!

283
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:13,500
Don't stand there! Go inside, Mum!

284
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:15,800
Oh, blimey.

285
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:27,000
How'd you do that, then?

286
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:36,700
OK, so I lied. I went for a look.
The whole crash-landing's a fake.
I thought so - just too perfect.

287
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:41,200
I mean, hitting Big Ben, come on!
So I thought, "Let's go and have
a look at the pilot." My mum's here.

288
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:46,200
Oh, just what I need. Don't you dare
make this place domestic!
You ruined my life, Doctor.

289
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:51,600
They thought she was dead. I was
a murder suspect because of you.
You see what I mean? Domestic!

290
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:55,500
I bet you don't even remember
my name! Ricky. It's Mickey.
No, it's Ricky.

291
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:59,500
I think I know my own name! THINK
you know it? How stupid are you?
Mum, don't! Don't go anywhere.

292
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:01,700
Don't start a fight.

293
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:04,400
Mum! It's not like that, he's not. . .

294
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:09,100
I'll be up in a minute hold on!

295
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:16,000
That was a real spaceship? Yep.
So it's all a pack of lies.
What is it then? Are they invading?

296
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:21,300
Funny way to invade,
putting the world on red alert.
Good point. So what they up to?

297
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:30,700
'. .Crisis continues. the Government
shows remarkable lack of leadership,
paranoia sweeps the country.

298
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:35,900
'There've been at least three reports
of public assaults on people
possibly identified as aliens.

299
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:38,300

ENGAGED TONE

307
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:08,200
Yes, I've seen one, I really
have, an alien. And she's with him.

308
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:12,600
My daughter, she's with him and she's
not safe. Oh, my God, she's not safe.

309
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:18,100
I've seen an alien and I know
his name. He's called the Doctor.

310
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:23,800
It's a box, a blue box.
She called it a Tardis.

So what you doing down there?
Ricky. . . Mickey.

312

Ricky, if I was to tell you what
I was doing to the controls of
my frankly magnificent timeship,

would you even begin to understand?
I suppose not. . .

00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:52,400
Shut it, then.

315
00:30:57,400 --> 00:31:00,800
Some friend you've got.
He's winding you up.

316
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:05,100
I am sorry.

317
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:07,300
OK. I am, though.

318
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:14,300
Every day, I looked.

319
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:19,800
On every street corner, wherever
I went. Looking for a blue box.
For a whole year.

320
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:21,800
It's only been a few days for me.

321
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:28,500
I dunno, it's hard to tell
inside this thing but I swear, it's
just a few days since I left you.

322
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:32,800
Not enough time to miss me, then.

323
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:34,900
I did miss you.

324
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:42,400
I missed you.

325
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:47,400
So, um, in 12 months. . .

326
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:50,000
have you been seeing anyone else?

327
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:51,600
Nope.

328
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:56,000
OK. . . Mainly cos everyone thinks
I murdered you.

329
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,100
Right.

330
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:03,600
So, now that you've come back. . .

331
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:06,800
are you gonna stay?

332
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:09,900
Got it!

333
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
Aha!

334
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:18,200
Patched in the radar, looped it back
12 hours so it followed the flight of
that spaceship. Here we go, hold on.

335
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:19,500
Come on!

336
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:23,200
That's the spaceship
on its way to Earth, see?

337
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:26,000
Except! Hold on. . .

338
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,600
See? The space-ship did a slingshot
round the Earth before it landed.

339
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:35,000
What's that mean? It came from Earth
in the first place. Went up and came
back down. Whoever those aliens are,

340
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:39,700
they've been here a while. Question
is, what've they been doing?

341
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:51,000
What d'you think, how's
the compression? I think I've got
too much ballast round the middle.

342
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:54,100
PHRRRT!
Ooh, that's better!

343
00:32:54,200 --> 00:33:00,100
We must fix the gas exchange. It's
getting ridiculous. Oh, seems human
to me. . . Better get rid of his skin.

344
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:03,200
Shame, I quite enjoyed being Oliver.

345
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:07,600
He had a wife,
a mistress and a young farmer.

346
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:09,900
HE CHUCKLES

347
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:12,500
God, I was busy!

348
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:15,800
Back to work.

349
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:19,600
I have an army to command!
Careful now. We're not there yet.

350
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:32,600
General Asquith.
Sir, we've had a priority alarm,
it's code nine, confirmed code nine.

351
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:35,400
Right. Good. Code Nine.

352
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:39,200
Which would mean. . . ?

353
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:42,400
In the event of emergency protocols
being activated,

354
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:47,600
our software automatically searches
all communications for keywords.
And one of those words is "doctor".

355
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:51,500
I think we've found him, sir.
What sort of doctor? Who is he?

356
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:57,100
Evidently, he's some sort of expert
in extraterrestrial affairs - the
ultimate expert! We need him, sir,

357
00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:59,300
we need him here right now.

358
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:07,700
How many channels you get? All the
basic packages. Sports channels?

359
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:11,300
Yes, I get the football.
Hold on. I know that lot.

360
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:15,600
'. .but likely that the Government's
bringing in alien-specialists,

361
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:19,200
'those people who've devoted their
lives to studying outer space.'

362
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:24,600
UNIT, United Nations
Intelligence Taskforce. Good people.
How d'you know 'em?

363
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:30,200
Cos he's worked for them. Oh, yeah,
don't think I sat on my backside for
12 months, Doctor, I read up on you.

364
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:34,900
Look deep enough on the Internet or
in history books - there's his name.
Followed by a list of the dead.

365
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:38,600
That's nice, good boy, Ricky(!) If
you know 'em, why not go and help?

366
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:44,000
They wouldn't recognise me. I've
changed a lot since the old days.
Besides, the world's on a knife-edge.

367
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:49,500
There's aliens out there - and fake
aliens. I wanna keep this alien
out of the mix. I'm going undercover.

368
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:54,100
PING!
I'd better keep the Tardis out
of sight. Ricky, you've got a car,

369
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:57,700
you can drive. Where to? The roads
are clearing. Let's see that ship.

370
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:03,200
'DO NOT MOVE!'
SIRENS WHOOP

371
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:14,500
TROOPS YELL

372
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:20,700
ROSE!

373
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:23,500
Rose!

374
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:32,800
ON PA: Raise your hands above your
heads! You are under arrest!

375
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:35,000
Take me to your leader.

376
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,300
 .My daughter. . . !

377
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:38,700
CHATTER AND STATIC ON RADIOS

378
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:45,500
This is a bit posh! If I'd known it
would be like this, being arrested,
I would've done it years ago.

379
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:52,100
We're not being arrested,
we're being escorted. Where to?
Downing Street. Where d'you think?

380
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:54,900
You're kidding! I'm not!

381
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:58,600
10 Downing Street? That's the one!
Oh, my God!

382
00:35:58,700 --> 00:36:03,400
I'm going to 10 Downing Street?
How come? I hate to say it,
but Mickey was right.

383
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:08,800
Over the years I've visited this
planet, a lot of times, and I've
been. . .noticed. Now they need you.

384
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:14,000
Like it said on the news, they're
gathering experts in alien knowledge.
Who's the biggest expert of the lot?

385
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:20,900
Patrick Moore. Apart from him.
Oh, don't you just love it(!) Ah,
I'm telling you! Lloyd George,

386
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:26,600
he used to drink me under the table.
Who's the Prime Minister now?
How should I know? I missed a year.

387
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:39,300
PRESS PACK SHOUT QUESTIONS

388
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:49,200
(Oh, my God.)

389
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:53,300
 .So she's OK, then?

390
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:58,400
She's not in any trouble? All I can
say is that your daughter and her
companion might be in a position

391
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:04,700
to help the country. We'll need
to know how she made contact
with this man. IF he is a man.

392
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,600
PHRRRT!
Oops!

393
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:11,700
Right, off you go, then.
I need to talk with Mrs Tyler
on my own, thank you.

394
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:14,200
TUMMY RUMBLES

395
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:23,100
Harriet Jones, MP Flydale North.

396
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:36,200
Ladies and gentlemen, can we
convene? Quick as we can please.

397
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:40,400
This way, on the right. ID cards
are to be worn at all times.

398
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:46,000
Here's your ID card. I'm sorry, your
companion doesn't have clearance.
I don't go anywhere without her.

399
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:50,300
You're the Code Nine, not her.
Now, I'm sorry, er. . .Doctor,

400
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:55,800
She'll have to stay outside. She's
staying with me. Look, even I don't
have clearance to go in there.

401
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:58,200
I can't let her in.
That's OK. . .You go.

402
00:37:58,300 --> 00:38:04,300
Excuse me, are you the doctor? . .Not
now! We're busy, can't you go home?
I just need a word in private. . .OK.

403
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:07,900
You haven't clearance. Leave it!
 .I'll leave you with security.

404
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:12,300
It's all right, I'll look after her.
Let me be of some use.

405
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:14,100
Walk with me.

406
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:16,200
Just keep walking. . .

407
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:18,700
That's right, don't look round.

408
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:22,100
Harriet Jones MP, Flydale North.

409
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:43,700
'. .This friend of yours,'

410
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:47,300
 .he's an expert, is that right?

411
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:52,900
He know. . H-He knows about aliens?
Why d'you wanna to know?

412
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:07,100
Ladies and gentlemen. . . Attention,
please? As you see from the summary,
the ship had one porcine pilot.

413
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:12,200
Of course the really interesting bit
happened three days ago, see? Filed
away under "any other business".

414
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:17,700
The North Sea. A satellite detected
a signal, a blip of radiation
at 100 fathoms.

415
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:22,300
Like there's something's down there.
You were just about to investigate,
next thing you know, this happens.

416
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:25,600
Spaceships, pigs, massive diversion.
>From what?

417
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:29,300
They turn the body into a suit,
a disguise, for the thing inside. . . !

418
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:32,300
It's all right, I believe you.

419
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:34,900
It's. . . It's, alien.

420
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:41,800
But they must have some serious
technology behind this. If we could
find it, we could use it.

421
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:45,900
Oh, my God. Is that. . . ?

422
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:49,900
 .Harriet, for God's sake! This is
beyond a joke, you cannot wander. . .

423
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:54,800
Oh, my God.
That's the Prime Minister.

424
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:58,800
If aliens fake an alien crash and
an alien pilot, what do they get?

425
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:04,200
Us.

426
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:06,400
They get us.

427
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:08,700
It's not a diversion, it's a trap.

428
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:11,600
Oh. . .

429
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:14,700
 .has someone been naughty?

430
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:25,700
It was bigger on the inside. . .
I don't know! What do I know
about spaceships?

431
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:29,800
That's what worries me. You see,
this man is classified as trouble,

432
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:34,600
which means that anyone associated
with him. . .is trouble.

433
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:37,200
And that's my job,

434
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:39,500
eliminating trouble.

435
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:46,000
But that's not possible.

436
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,100
He left this afternoon.

437
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:51,600
I mean, the Prime Minister left
Downing Street, he was driven away.

438
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:54,400
And who told you that(? )

439
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:57,100
Hmm?

440
00:40:58,900 --> 00:41:00,700
Me.

441
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:10,400
This is about us! Alien experts,
the only people who know how to fight
them - gathered together in one room.

442
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:12,300
PHRRRT!

443
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:16,000
'Scuse me. D'you mind not farting
while I'm saving the world?

444
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:19,300
Would you rather
silent but deadly?

445
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:29,300
EVIL SNIGGER

446
00:41:38,100 --> 00:41:41,100
REALLY EVIL GUFFAWS

447
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:55,800
MENACING GURGLES

448
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:01,000
Grrr! Hmmm!

449
00:42:06,700 --> 00:42:09,500
SLITHERY SQUELCHING

450
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:18,600
GRRR!

451
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:53,300
We are the Slitheen.

452
00:42:56,100 --> 00:42:57,400
GRRR!

453
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:14,900
Thank you all for wearing
your ID. cards.

454
00:43:14,900 --> 00:43:17,500
They'll help to identify the bodies.

455
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:44,500
'. .Yesterday saw the start
of a brave new world.'

456
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:47,800
Today might see it end.

457
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:52,000
Oi. If you want aliens, you've got
'em. They're inside Downing Street.

458
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:00,600
Planet Earth is at war.

459
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:06,600
GUNSHOT
Everybody RUN!

460
00:44:07,900 --> 00:44:10,100
Who exactly are Slitheen? Aliens.

461
00:44:12,500 --> 00:44:14,800
I could save the world but lose you.
