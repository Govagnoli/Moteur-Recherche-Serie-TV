1
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:04,560
Get down! Aargh! They're
following us! And the good news is?

2
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:10,440
Their lifespans are running out so
we wait for them to die. I must stop
being a Time Lord and become human.

3
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:13,200
Chameleon arch, rewrites my biology.

4
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:17,200
Journal of impossible things,
such imagination.

5
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:21,480
It's become quite a hobby!
He's different from any man
you've ever met, right? Yes.

6
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:24,080
He had to go and fall in love
with a human and it wasn't me.

7
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:26,480
If they find us, Martha,
open the watch.

8
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:29,200
Sometimes I say things,
they turn out to be correct.

9
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:32,800
Arghhh!

10
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,800
They found us.

11
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,520
Oh, my God, where's the watch.
What are you talking about?

12
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:41,920
This is not you, this is 1913.

13
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:43,800
Change back!

14
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:46,000
Arghh!

15
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:48,480
We need a Time Lord.

16
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:51,360
Which one of them do you want us
to kill?

17
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:54,200
Doesn't this scare you enough
to change back?

18
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:56,920
Your friend or your lover?

19
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,960
Make your decision, Mr Smith.

20
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:45,400
Perhaps if that human heart
breaks, the Time Lord will emerge.

21
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,360
Time Lord...
TICKING

22
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:52,080
All right!

23
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:55,240
One more move and I shoot. Oh,
the maid is full of fire!

24
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,080
And you can shut up!

25
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,880
Careful, Son of Mine.

26
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:03,800
This is all for you, so that you
can live forever. Shoot you down.

27
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,880
Try it. We'll die together.

28
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,600
Would you really pull the trigger?

29
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:12,680
You look too scared.

30
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,640
Scared and holding a gun's a good
combination! Want to risk it?

31
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:29,240
Doctor,
get everyone out, there's a door at
the side, it's over there, go on,

32
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,880
Do it. Mr Smith, I mean you!

33
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,040
Do what she said.

34
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:34,120
Everybody out! Now!

35
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:39,400
Don't argue, Mr Jackson, they're mad,
that's all we need to know. Susan,
Miss Cooper, outside, all of you!

36
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,200
THEY SCREAM

37
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:47,200
Back to the school, quickly.
And you, go on, just shift.
What about you?

38
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:51,280
Mr Smith, I think you should
escort your lady friend
to safety, don't you?

39
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:04,120
Get everyone out!... Latimer,
get back to the school, tell the
Headmaster...

40
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:06,240
Don't touch me!
You're as bad as them!

41
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:16,080
Don't try anything! I'm warning
you, or Sonny Boy gets it. She's
almost brave, this one.

42
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:21,080
I should have taken her form. Much
more fun. So much spirit.

43
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:25,280
What happened to jenny? Is she gone?
She is consumed. Her body's mine.

44
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:29,440
You mean she's dead? Yes! And she
went with precious little dignity.

45
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:31,360
All that "aah!" - screaming!

46
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,120
Get the gun!

47
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:35,320
Good work.

48
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:40,840
Don't just stand there! Move! God,
you're rubbish as a human, come on!

49
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:43,040
PEOPLE SCREAMING

50
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:45,360
EXPLOSIONS

51
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:53,400
Run! Oh, this is super! We've been
hiding for too long, this is sport!

52
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:57,760
I can smell the schoolteacher,
he's gone back to his academy.

53
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:00,200
And what do we know about her?

54
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,600
This body has traces of memory.

55
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:06,800
Was once her friend.
Martha would go walking to the west.

56
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:11,000
Husband of Mine, follow
the maid's scent, go to the west.

57
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,320
Find out what she
was keeping secret.

58
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,000
Soldiers!

59
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:20,360
As for you, Mother of Mine...

60
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:24,040
...let's go to school.

61
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,520
RINGS BELL

62
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:43,400
What are you doing?! Maybe I can't
fight them. But this school teaches
us to stand together! Take arms!

63
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:46,720
You can't do that. You want me to
fight, don't you? Take arms!

64
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:50,720
Take arms! Take arms!
I say, sir! What's the matter?

65
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:55,320
Enemy at the door, Hutchinson!
Enemy at the door! Take arms!

66
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:04,160
They're sounding the alarms! I
wouldn't be so pleased, Son of Mine.

67
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:07,720
These bodies can damage and die,
that's why we need the Time Lord.

68
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:09,720
Indeed, they will have guns.

69
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:11,680
Perhaps a little caution.

70
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:15,040
Sister of Mine.
You're such a small little thing.

71
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:17,320
Find a way in and spy on them.

72
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:25,920
We can't do this, Doctor! Mr Smith?

73
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:29,800
Redford, maintain position,
faster now. They're boys!
They don't stand a chance.

74
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:32,960
They are cadets, trained to defend
the King and all properties.

75
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:39,200
What in thunder's name is this?!
Before I devise an excellent and
endless series of punishments for

76
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:45,400
each and every one of you, could
someone explain, very simply, and
immediately, exactly is going on?

77
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:49,840
Headmaster, I have to report the
school is under attack. Really? Is
that so?

78
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:53,440
Perhaps we should have a word in
private. Sir, I was in the village,
with Matron.

79
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:56,840
It's Baines, sir, Jeremy Baines, and
Mr Clark, from Oakham Farm, they've

80
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:01,680
gone mad, sir, they've got guns.
They've already murdered people
in the village, I saw it happen.

81
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:05,840
Matron? Is that so? I'm afraid it's
true, sir. Murder? On our own soil?

82
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:08,200
I saw it, yes.

83
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:12,720
Perhaps you did well then, Mr Smith.
What makes you think the
danger's coming here?

84
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:17,000
Well... they said, uh...
Baines threatened Mr Smith, sir.

85
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:22,160
Said he'd follow him.
We don't know why. Very well.

86
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:25,280
You boys, remain on guard.
Mr Snell, telephone for the police.

87
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:28,440
Mr Phillips, with me.
We shall investigate.
But it's not safe out there.

88
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:35,080
Mr Smith, it seems your favourite
servant is giving me advice. You
will control her, sir.

89
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,480
Gotta find that watch.

90
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:44,880
'Hold me, keep me safe,
keep me dark.

91
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:48,160
'And keep me closed -
the time is not right.

92
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:51,440
'Not yet,
not while The Family is abroad.

93
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:54,280
'Danger.'

94
00:06:56,280 --> 00:07:01,360
So... Baines
and one of the cleaning staff,
there's always a woman involved.

95
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:06,600
Am I to gather that some practical
joke has got out of hand?
Headmaster, sir! Good evening, sir!

96
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:10,400
Come to give me a caning, sir,
would you like that, sir?
Keep a civil tongue.

97
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:13,480
Come on, everyone, I suspect
alcohol's played its part in this.

98
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:16,560
Let’s just calm down. And who
are these friends of yours, Baines?

99
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:19,840
In fancy dress?
D'you like them, Mr Phillips?

100
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:26,320
Look.

101
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:30,000
S'called molecular
fringe animation!
Fashioned in the shape of straw men.

102
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:32,120
My own private army!
S'ever so good, sir!

103
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,160
Baines, step apart and
come inside with me.

104
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:39,080
No sir, you sir,
YOU will send us Mr john Smith.

105
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:42,240
That's all we want, sir, Mr john
Smith and whatever he's done with

106
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:46,640
his Time Lord consciousness,
then we'll be very happy
to leave you alone.

107
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:49,760
You speak with someone else's
voice, Baines. Who might that be?

108
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,960
We are the Family of Blood.

109
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,680
Mr Smith said there had been deaths.
Yes, sir! And they were good, sir!

110
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:01,360
Well, I warn you. The school is
armed. All your little tin soldiers!

111
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:03,520
But tell me, sir...

112
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:07,040
will they thank you?
I don't understand.

113
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:09,080
What do you know of history, sir?

114
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,080
What d'you know of next year?

115
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:14,640
You're not making sense. 1914, sir.

116
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:22,320
Because the Family has travelled
far and wide, looking for Mr Smith,
and oh, the things we have seen.

117
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:24,440
War is coming.

118
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:31,880
In foreign fields. War of the
whole wide world, with all your
boys falling down in the mud.

119
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:36,200
Do you think they will thank the
man who taught them it was glorious?

120
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,960
Don't you forget, boy.
I've been a soldier.

121
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I was in South Africa.
I used my dead mates for sandbags.

122
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:45,000
I fought with the butt of my rifle
when the bullets ran out,

123
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:47,920
and I would go back there tomorrow
for King and Country.

124
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,840
Etcetera... etcetera.

125
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:53,120
HE SCREAMS

126
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:58,400
Run along, Headmaster. Run back
to school. And send us Mr Smith!

127
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:01,360
LAUGHTER

128
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:17,320
Mr Phillips has been murdered,
Mr Smith. Can you tell me why?

129
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,880
Honestly, sir, I have no idea.

130
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:22,000
And the telephone line's been
disconnected. We're on our own.

131
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:25,520
If we have to make a fight of it,
then make a fight we shall.

132
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:28,960
Hutchinson! We'll build a
barricade within the courtyards!

133
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,840
Fortify the entrances!
Build defences!

134
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:36,160
Gentlemen, in the name of the King,
we shall stand against them!
Yes, sir!

135
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:47,240
Barricade the kitchens,
secure the passageway to the stables.

136
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:49,280
You little coward.

137
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:51,680
You'll do your duty, Latimer.
With the rest of us!

138
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:54,400
Sandbags to the north and west!
Williams, you take charge!

139
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:57,840
Quickly now...
Pemberton, load the spare magazines
with bullets!

140
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:59,960
Take the magazine cut-off out!

141
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,160
They've got an army...

142
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:05,840
...So do we.

143
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:07,760
Soldiers!

144
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,600
SOLDIERS!

145
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:30,840
Ashington, we need water
for the Vickers Gun, see to it!
Faster, all of you! Faster.

146
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:38,320
Lockley, when firing commences,
you're in charge of the gathering.

147
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:41,440
Peterson, that's not acceptable,
report to your senior officer.

148
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:04,520
War comes to England,
a year in advance.

149
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,040
'Family of Mine, wait.

150
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:11,760
'Hold the soldiers back. The Time
Lord is playing some sort of trick.'

151
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:15,520
'Discover him, Sister of Mine.'

152
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:18,400
I know it sounds mad! But
when the Doctor became human,

153
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:21,600
he took the alien part of himself,
and stored it inside the watch.

154
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:23,520
It's not a watch,
it just looks like a watch.

155
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:25,240
And "alien" means?

156
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:27,640
Not from abroad, I take it?

157
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:30,000
The man you call john Smith.

158
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:32,480
He was born on another world.

159
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:34,920
A different species? Yeah.

160
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:40,120
Then tell me.
In this fairy tale... who are you?

161
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,240
Just a friend, I'm not...

162
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:45,440
I mean, you haven't got a rival!
As much as I might...

163
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:48,880
just his friend.
And... human, I take it?

164
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:53,200
Human, don't worry! And,
I don't just follow him around,
I'm training to be a doctor...

165
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:56,040
Not an alien doctor, a proper
doctor, a doctor of medicine.

166
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:57,600
Well, that is nonsense.

167
00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:02,120
Women might train to be doctors,
but hardly the skivvy. And hardly
one of your colour.

168
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,880
Oh, d'you think?

169
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:07,560
Bones of the hand.

170
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:11,000
Carpal bones, proximal row,
scaphoid, lunate, triquetrum,

171
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:15,680
pisiform, distal row, trapezium,
trapezoid, capitate, hamate,
then the metacarpal bones,

172
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:19,320
extending in three distinct
phalanges, proximal, middle, distal.

173
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:22,800
You read that in a book.
Yes! To pass my exams!

174
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:25,400
Can't you see? This is true.

175
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:29,000
I must go. If we find that
watch, then we can stop them.

176
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:34,120
Those boys are going to fight.
I might not be a doctor, but I'm
still their nurse. They need me.

177
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:43,760
Son of Mine, Wife of Mine. 'Father
of Mine, what have you found?'

178
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:46,280
His Tardis!

179
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,200
The Doctor can't escape.

180
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:52,760
You're with Armitage and
Thwaites, they know the drill.

181
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,640
Joan, it's not safe.

182
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:59,320
I'm doing my duty,
just as much as you.

183
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:03,640
Fine evening we've had together.

184
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:07,120
Not quite as planned.

185
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:10,520
Tell me about Nottingham.

186
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,760
I'm sorry?
That's where you were brought up.

187
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:15,080
Tell me about it.

188
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:19,960
Well... It lies on the River Leen,

189
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:25,160
with its southern boundary following
the course of the River Trent, which
flows from Stoke to the Humber.

190
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:28,000
That sounds like an encyclopaedia.
Where did you live?

191
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:34,080
Broadmarsh Street. Adjacent to
Hockley Terrace, in the district of
Radford Parade. But more than facts.

192
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:36,520
When you were a child,
where did you play?

193
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:40,240
All those secret little places,
the dens and hideaways
that only a child knows.

194
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:45,400
Tell me, john, please tell me.

195
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:48,200
How can you think I'm not real?

196
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:51,800
When I kissed you, was that a lie?
No, it wasn't, no.

197
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:58,240
But this Doctor, sounds like some,
some romantic lost prince.

198
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:00,000
Would you rather that?

199
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:07,120
Am I not enough? No, that's
not true. Never. I've got to go.

200
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:10,720
Martha was right about one thing,
though. Those boys, they're children.

201
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:14,040
John Smith wouldn't want them
to fight, never mind the Doctor,

202
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:16,920
the john Smith I was getting to know.

203
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:19,160
He knows it's wrong.

204
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:22,960
Doesn't he? Mr Smith, if you please.

205
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,080
What choice do I have?

206
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:41,560
Get those bags piled up, filth,
they'll be the difference
between life and death for us!

207
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,960
Not for you and me.
What are you babbling about?

208
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,840
We go to battle together.

209
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:50,360
We fight alongside.

210
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:54,520
I've seen it. But not here, not now.
What's that supposed to mean?

211
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:57,400
It means that you and
I both survive this.

212
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:01,800
And maybe I was given this watch...

213
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:05,080
so I could help.

214
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,640
I'm sorry.

215
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:08,360
Latimer! You filthy coward!

216
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:10,800
Yes, sir. Every time.

217
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:22,280
What do I do?

218
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:26,360
What do I do? What do I do?

219
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:30,160
'Beware. ' Beware of what? 'Her.'

220
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:40,160
Keep away. Who are you?
I saw you at the dance.

221
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:43,280
You were with that family,
you're one of them.

222
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:45,720
What are you hiding? Nothing.

223
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:48,160
What have you got there? Nothing.

224
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:50,080
Show me, little boy.

225
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,840
I reckon whatever you are,

226
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:54,640
you're still in the shape of a girl.

227
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:57,080
How strong is she, d'you think?

228
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:59,520
Does she really want to see this?!

229
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:10,320
Time Lord! Inside the device!
Everything he is. Concealed away.
In the hands of a schoolboy.

230
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:14,960
But now we know. That's all we need
to find - the boy, and the watch.

231
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:20,240
What are we waiting for?!
Attaaaaack!

232
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:29,320
Stand to!

233
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,880
THUDDING AND CRASHING

234
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:42,400
At post! Enemy approaching, sir.

235
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:49,720
Steady. Find the biting point...

236
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:52,560
PANICKED BREATHING

237
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,920
CRASHING

238
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:07,840
Fire!
LOUD GUNFIRE

239
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:13,160
RAT-A-TAT OF MACHINE GUN

240
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:21,640
CHOIR SINGS

241
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:43,320
Cease fire!

242
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,880
Just straw.

243
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:58,000
Like he said.

244
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:00,680
Straw. Then no-one's dead, sir.

245
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,840
We killed no-one.

246
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:07,720
Stand to!

247
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:13,560
You child, come out of the way.
Come into the school,
we don't know who's out there.

248
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:16,520
It's the Cartwright girl, isn't it?
Come here, come to me.

249
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:18,080
Mr Rocastle, please.

250
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:21,000
Don't go near her.
You were told to be quiet.

251
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:23,240
Just listen to me. She's part of it.

252
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,960
Matron, tell him.

253
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,120
I don't know, I think you should
stay back, Headmaster. Mr Smith...

254
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:32,400
She was...
She was with Baines, in the village.

255
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:35,600
Mr Smith, I've seen many
strange sights this night.

256
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:40,840
But there is no cause on God's Earth
that would allow me to see this
child in the field of battle, sir.

257
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:44,760
Come with me. You're funny.

258
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:48,800
That's right. Now take my hand.
So funny.

259
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:51,960
HE SCREAMS

260
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:58,200
Now who's going to shoot me?
Any of you? Really?

261
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:01,120
Put down your guns.
But, sir. The Headmaster...

262
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:02,920
I'll not see this happen.

263
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,600
Not any more.

264
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:09,400
You will retreat. In an orderly
fashion. Back through the school.
Hutchinson, lead the way.

265
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,920
But sir... I said, lead the way.

266
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:14,800
Well, go on then, run!

267
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:18,760
Soldiers! Come on! Reanimate!

268
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,160
PANICKED SHOUTING

269
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:37,280
Out you go, quick as you can.

270
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:40,240
Don't go to the village,
it's not safe. And you, ladies.

271
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:42,760
Not till we've got the boys out.

272
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:45,280
One of these boys has got the watch.

273
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:47,320
This one?

274
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,760
No. This one? No.

275
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:51,840
This one? No. Get off me!

276
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:54,080
I said get off!

277
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:56,320
This one, is that him?

278
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:57,960
No.

279
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,200
Right, then we can kill this lot.

280
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:05,600
'Lord of time.' That's him!
Upstairs.

281
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:11,200
Don't just stand there.
Outside, come on, out!

282
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,800
I insist, the pair of you, just go.

283
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:23,680
If there are any more boys inside,
I'll find them.

284
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:26,480
I think... retreat!

285
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:44,960
Doctor!

286
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,600
Doc-taaaar!

287
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:54,040
Come back, Doctor! Come home!

288
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:57,280
Come and claim your prize!

289
00:20:57,320 --> 00:21:00,440
Out you come, Doctor!
There's a good boy!

290
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,000
Come to the family!

291
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:06,000
Time to end it, now!
You recognise it, don't you?

292
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:08,680
Come out, Doctor!

293
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:13,720
Come to us.
I've never seen it in my life.

294
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:16,600
Do you remember its name?

295
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:20,000
I'm sorry, john,
but you wrote about it.

296
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:23,400
The blue box,
you dreamt of a blue box.

297
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:27,320
I'm not...

298
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:29,120
I'm john Smith.

299
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:31,040
That's all I want to be. John Smith.

300
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:34,080
With his life. And his job.

301
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:37,560
And his love. Why can't I be
john Smith? Isn't he a good man?

302
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:40,880
Yes, yes, he is. Why can't I stay?

303
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:43,520
But we need the Doctor.

304
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:50,240
And who am I, then? Nothing?

305
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:51,800
I'm just a story?

306
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,400
One more phase, and
we won't have to hunt.

307
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:04,800
The Doctor, Mr Smith,
the boy, the watch -

308
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:07,320
they will come to us!

309
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:10,760
Soldiers, guard this thing!

310
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:18,440
This way!
I think I know somewhere we can hide.

311
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:21,760
We've got to keep going. Just listen
to me for once, john, follow me!

312
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:27,560
Power up! Fully armed and ready.

313
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:30,440
Mother and Father
and Sister of Mine,

314
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,640
prepare the armaments.

315
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:36,000
I doubt that England
is ready for this.

316
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:38,920
Fix targets. And counting down.

317
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:45,760
Here we are. It should be empty.

318
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:49,920
Oh, it's a long time
since I've run that far!

319
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:54,000
- But who lives here?
- If I'm right... no-one.

320
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:07,800
Hello?

321
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:09,400
No-one home.

322
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:12,640
We should be safe here.
Whose house is it, though?

323
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:17,000
The Cartwright’s', that little
girl at the school,
she's Lucy Cartwright.

324
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:19,560
Or she's taken
Lucy Cartwright's form.

325
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:29,160
If she came home this
afternoon, and if the parents

326
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,840
How easily I accept these ideas.

327
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:42,120
I must go to them.
Before anyone else dies.

328
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:46,240
You can't! Martha, there
must be something we can do.

329
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:50,160
Not without the watch. You're this
Doctor's companion, can't you help?!

330
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:53,120
What exactly d'you do for him?

331
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:55,960
Why does he need you?

332
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,680
Because he's lonely.

333
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,720
And that's what you
want me to become?

334
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:08,120
KNOCK ON DOOR
What if it's them?

335
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:12,040
I'm not an expert, but I
don't think scarecrows knock.

336
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:25,760
I brought you this.

337
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:29,680
Hold it. I won't.

338
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:31,880
Please. Just hold it.

339
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:34,400
It told me to find you,
it wants to be held.

340
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:37,960
You've had this watch all this time,
why didn't you return it?

341
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,360
Because it was waiting,

342
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:43,560
then because I was so scared.

343
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:47,360
Of the Doctor. Why?

344
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:51,440
Because... I've seen him.

345
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:57,120
He's like fire. And ice. And rage.

346
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:59,760
He's like the night and
the storm and the heart of the sun.

347
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:05,360
Stop it. He's ancient and forever.
He burns at the centre of time, and
he can see the turn of the universe.

348
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:06,960
Stop it, I said stop it.

349
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,360
And he's wonderful.

350
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:17,680
I've still got this - the journal.

351
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:20,200
Those are just stories.

352
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:24,240
Now we know that's not true.
Perhaps there's something in here.

353
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:26,680
LOUD EXPLOSION
What the hell?

354
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:34,920
This'll flush him out.
This'll do it. Super, super fun!

355
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,880
They're destroying the village.

356
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:43,960
The watch. John, don't.

357
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,160
Can you hear it?
FAINT VOICE MURMURS

358
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:48,000
Like he's asleep.

359
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:49,760
Waiting to waken.

360
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:53,520
Why did he speak to me?
Oh, low level telepathic field,
you were born with it,

361
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:55,600
just an extra synaptic engram,
causing...

362
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:03,000
Is that how he talks?
That's him. All you have to do
is open it, and he's back.

363
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:10,400
You knew this. And yet you
watched, while Miss Redfern and I...
I didn't know how to stop you.

364
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:13,840
He gave me a list of things to watch
out for, but that wasn't included!

365
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:16,480
Falling in love.
That didn't even occur to him?

366
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:18,480
No.

367
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:21,240
Then what sort of man is that?

368
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:23,920
And now you expect me to die?

369
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:27,000
It was always gonna end.
The Doctor said, the Family's got

370
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:31,080
a limited lifespan, that's why
they need to consume a Time Lord.

371
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:33,680
Otherwise, three months,
and they die.

372
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:36,680
Like mayflies, he said.

373
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:39,080
So your job was to execute me.

374
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:43,320
People are dying out there!

375
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:45,920
They need him. And I need him.

376
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:50,960
Cos you've got no idea what he's
like. I've only just met him.
It wasn't even that long ago, but...

377
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:54,520
He is everything.

378
00:26:54,560 --> 00:27:00,120
He’s just everything to me,
and he doesn't even look
at me but I don't care,

379
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:05,680
cos I love him to bits, and I hope to
God he won't remember me saying this.

380
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:07,760
LOUDER EXPLOSION

381
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:09,760
It's getting closer.

382
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:12,880
I should have thought of it before!
I can give them this!

383
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:16,000
Just the watch! Then they can
leave and I can stay as I am!

384
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:19,040
You can't do that! If they want
the Doctor, they can have him!

385
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:22,000
He'll never let you do it.
If they get what they want, then...

386
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:24,640
Then it all ends in destruction.

387
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:29,200
I never read to the end.
Those creatures would live forever.

388
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:33,760
To breed and conquer. War,
across the stars. For every child.

389
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:38,280
Martha. Timothy.

390
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:40,880
Could you leave us alone, please?

391
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:01,040
SHELLS WHISTLE OVERHEAD

392
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:16,360
If I could do this instead of you,
then I would.

393
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:26,480
But my hopes aren't important.

394
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:28,880
He won't love you.

395
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:31,400
If he's not you, then
I don't want him to.

396
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:36,200
I had one husband and he died,

397
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:38,880
and I never thought, ever again...

398
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:42,800
And then you...

399
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:46,800
You were so... And it was real,
I wasn't.

400
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:50,320
I really thought...

401
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:55,200
Let me see. Blasted thing.

402
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:58,320
Blasted, blasted thing.

403
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:00,880
I can't even hear it.
Says nothing to me.

404
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:10,800
BABY CRIES

405
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:16,040
LAUGHTER

406
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:27,080
They're all safe, aren't they?
The children.

407
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:30,560
The grandchildren.

408
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:36,120
Everyone's safe? Everyone's safe.

409
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:40,120
And they all send their love, john.

410
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:44,080
Well, then. It's done.

411
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:46,600
Thank you.

412
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:55,360
Did you see?

413
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:58,160
The Time Lord has such adventures.

414
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:05,480
But he could never have a life
like that. And yet I could.

415
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:13,680
What are you going to do?

416
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:24,720
We'll blast them into dust,
then fuse the dust into glass,
then shatter them all over again.

417
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:26,520
FOOTSTEPS

418
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:29,320
just...
PINGING NOISES

419
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:32,080
just stop the bombardment,

420
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:34,920
That's all I ask. I'll do
anything you want, just stop.

421
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:37,400
Say please.

422
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:39,880
Please.

423
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:44,560
Wait a minute...

424
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:48,560
Still human.

425
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:54,800
I can't pretend to understand,
not for a second. But I want you
to know, I'm innocent in all this.

426
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:59,440
He made me john Smith, it's not
like I had any control over it.

427
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:04,040
He didn't just make himself human,
he made himself an idiot.

428
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:05,560
Same thing, isn't it?

429
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:10,800
I don't care about this Doctor, and
your Family, I just want you to go.

430
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:13,480
So I've made my choice.

431
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:14,960
You can have him,

432
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:19,640
just take it, please, take him away.
At last.

433
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,840
Don't think that's saved your life.

434
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:32,080
Family of Mine.

435
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:37,120
Now we shall have the
lives of a Time Lord.

436
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:47,840
It's empty. Where's he gone?

437
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:50,040
You tell me.

438
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:55,320
Oh, I think the explanation
might be you've been fooled by a
simple olfactory misdirection.

439
00:31:55,360 --> 00:32:00,560
A little bit like ventriloquism of
the nose. It's an elementary trick
in certain parts of the galaxy.

440
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:04,160
And it's got to be said,
I don't like the look
of that hydrokinometer.

441
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:10,320
It seems to be indicating you've got
energy feedback all the way through
the retro-stabilisers feeding back

442
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:14,960
into the primary heat converters.
Cos if there's one thing
you shouldn't have done,

443
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:18,840
you shouldn't have let me
press all those buttons.

444
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:22,720
But, in fairness,
I will give you one word of advice.

445
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:24,560
Run.

446
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:27,880
Get out! Get out!

It's done.

471
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,520
The police and the
army are at school.

472
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:50,040
Parents have come,
to take the boys home.

473
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:52,520
I should go,
they'll have so many questions,

474
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:54,560
I'm not sure what to say.

475
00:34:57,640 --> 00:35:00,600
Oh.

476
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:03,000
You look the same.

477
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:05,320
Goodness!
You must forgive my rudeness.

478
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:19,880
John Smith? He's in here somewhere.

479
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:22,080
Like a story.

480
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:25,480
Could you change back? Yes.

481
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:27,280
Will you?

482
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:29,400
No.

483
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:33,760
I see.

484
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:35,320
Well, then.

485
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:41,920
He was braver than you, in the end.

486
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:44,640
That ordinary man...

487
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:48,480
...you chose to change,

488
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:51,280
he chose to die.

489
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:55,080
Come with me. I'm sorry?

490
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:57,320
Travel with me.

491
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:59,640
As what? My companion.

492
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:01,960
Oh, but that's not fair.

493
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:07,480
What must I look like to you, Doctor?

494
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:09,280
I must seem so very small.

495
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:13,960
No. We could start again.
I'd like that.

496
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,320
You and me, we could try, at least.

497
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:23,520
Cos everything that john Smith
is and was,

498
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:26,800
I can't.

499
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:29,120
Please come with me. I can't.
Why not?

500
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:33,200
John Smith is dead.

501
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:34,800
And you look like him.

502
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,840
But he's here.

503
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:42,520
Inside.

504
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:46,480
If you look in my eyes.

505
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:52,720
Answer me this.
Just one question, that's all.

506
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:55,920
If the Doctor
had never visited us, if...

507
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:58,400
he'd never chosen this place,

508
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:01,320
on a whim...

509
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:03,640
Would anyone here have died?

510
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:13,280
(You can go.)

511
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:01,440
Right then. Molto bene!

512
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:03,000
How was she?

513
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:04,720
Time we moved on.

514
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:06,640
If you want, I could go and...

515
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:09,120
Time we moved on.

516
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:11,520
Um. Meant to say.

517
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:15,240
Back there, last night, I would've
said anything to get you to change.

518
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:17,240
Yeah, course you would.
I wasn't really...

519
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:19,240
No! No, no. Good! Fine!

520
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:21,840
So there we are, then.
There we are then, yes.

521
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:25,240
And I never said.

522
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:27,520
Thanks for looking after me.

523
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,880
Doctor! Martha!

524
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:37,720
Tim, Timothy, Tim!

525
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:40,640
I just wanted to say goodbye,

526
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:42,120
and thank you,

527
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:44,800
because I've seen the future,
and I now know what must be done.

528
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:48,760
It's coming, isn't it?

529
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:50,960
The biggest war ever.

530
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,240
You don't have to fight.
I think we do.

531
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:54,840
But you could get hurt.

532
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:58,760
Well, so could you,
travelling around with him.
But it's not going to stop you!

533
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:02,840
Tim.
I'd be honoured if you'd take this.

534
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:11,360
I can't hear anything.
No, it’s just a watch, now.

535
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:15,280
But keep it with you. For good luck.

536
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:17,160
Look after yourself.

537
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:26,640

Thank you, Doctor.

Come on, old chap.

550
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:42,920
Leave me. Not gonna make it.

551

Oh, yes, you are. Didn't I
promise you, all those years ago?

VICAR READS

555
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:18,160
They went with songs to the battle.
They were young, straight of limb,
true of eye, steady and aglow.

556
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:21,320
They were staunch to the end
against odds uncounted.

557
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:26,120
They fell with their faces
to the foe.

558
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:31,720
They shall grow not old, as
we that are left grow old.

559
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:36,440
Age shall not weary them,
nor the years condemn.

00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:41,160
At the going down of the sun
and in the morning,

561
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:43,200
we will remember them.

562
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:54,560
Don't blink. Blink and you're dead.

563
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:56,880
Don't turn your back.

564
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:58,480
Don't look away.

565
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:01,720
And don't blink.

566
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:04,880
Good luck.
