1
00:00:14,223 --> 00:00:17,570
- I said, no.
- A sapphire waterfall!

2
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:19,554
It's a waterfall, made of sapphires!

3
00:00:19,829 --> 00:00:21,460
<i>This enormous jewel,
size of a glacier,</i>

4
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:24,640
reaches the Cliffs of Oblivion, then
shatters into sapphires at the edge,

5
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:27,561
they fall 100,000 feet
into a crystal ravine.

6
00:00:27,661 --> 00:00:31,735
- I bet you say that to all the girls.
- Oh, come on, they're boarding now.

7
00:00:31,835 --> 00:00:34,230
It's no fun on my own.
Four hours, that's all it takes.

8
00:00:34,637 --> 00:00:38,869
<i>No, that's four hours there and four
hours back, that's like a school trip.</i>

9
00:00:38,969 --> 00:00:41,096
- I'd rather go sunbathing!
- You be careful.

10
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:42,996
<i>That's X-tonic sunlight.</i>

11
00:00:43,096 --> 00:00:47,455
Oh, I'm safe. It says in the brochure,
this glass is 15-feet thick.

12
00:00:47,555 --> 00:00:48,660
<i>All right, I give up.</i>

13
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:51,484
Back for dinner, we'll try that
antigravity restaurant. With bibs.

14
00:00:51,584 --> 00:00:52,335
<i>That's a date.</i>

15
00:00:52,621 --> 00:00:53,747
Well, not a date.

16
00:00:53,847 --> 00:00:55,719
Oh, you know what I mean.
Oh, get off!

17
00:00:55,957 --> 00:00:57,100
- See you later.
- Oy!

18
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:59,569
- And you be careful, all right?
- Naaah.

19
00:00:59,669 --> 00:01:00,670
Taking a big space truck

20
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:03,326
with bunch of strangers across
diamond planet called Midnight?

21
00:01:03,426 --> 00:01:04,965
What could possibly go wrong?

22
00:01:29,231 --> 00:01:32,490

00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:45,304
<i>Complimentary juicepack
and complimentary...</i>

27
00:01:45,404 --> 00:01:47,215
<i>Just the headphones, please.</i>

28
00:01:47,675 --> 00:01:48,914
There you go.

29
00:01:50,043 --> 00:01:52,540
That's the headphones
for Channels 1 to 36,

30
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,392
modem link for 3D vidgames,
complimentary earplugs,

31
00:01:55,624 --> 00:01:57,900
<i>complimentary slippers,
complimentary juicepack,</i>

32
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,451
<i>and complimentary peanuts.</i>

33
00:01:59,551 --> 00:02:01,525
I must warn you some
products may contain nuts.

34
00:02:01,794 --> 00:02:03,270
That'll be the peanuts.

35
00:02:03,915 --> 00:02:06,999
- Enjoy your trip.
- Oh, I can't wait! Allons-y!

36
00:02:07,688 --> 00:02:10,530
- I'm sorry?
- It's French, for let's go!

37
00:02:10,795 --> 00:02:12,050
Fascinating.

38
00:02:13,419 --> 00:02:15,928
- Headphones for channels 1-36...
- No thank you! Not for us!

39
00:02:16,028 --> 00:02:18,113
- Earplugs, please.
- There you go.

40
00:02:18,213 --> 00:02:21,735
They call it a sapphire waterfall,
but it's no such thing,

41
00:02:21,835 --> 00:02:24,020
sapphire's an aluminium oxide,

42
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:27,644
but the glacier is just a compound
silica with iron pigmentation!

43
00:02:27,744 --> 00:02:30,341
<i>- Have you got that pillow for my neck?
- Yes, sir.</i>

44
00:02:30,441 --> 00:02:31,535
<i>And the pills?</i>

45
00:02:31,635 --> 00:02:34,869
Yes, all measured
out for you, there you go.

46
00:02:35,507 --> 00:02:36,200
Hobbes!

47
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:38,170
Professor Winfold Hobbes!

48
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:40,698
- I'm the Doctor, hello!
- It's my 14th time!

49
00:02:40,917 --> 00:02:42,145
Oh! My first.

50
00:02:42,245 --> 00:02:44,097
And I'm Dee Dee, Dee Dee Blasco.

51
00:02:44,197 --> 00:02:47,312
Don't bother the man!
Where's my water bottle?

52
00:02:47,412 --> 00:02:50,122
<i>Complimentary slippers,
complimentary juicepack,</i>

53
00:02:50,222 --> 00:02:51,711
<i>and complimentary peanuts,</i>

54
00:02:51,811 --> 00:02:54,730
<i>I must warn you some
products may contain nuts.</i>

55
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:59,375
Don't be silly, come and sit with us.
Look! We get slippers!

56
00:02:59,475 --> 00:03:01,759
- Jethro! Do what your mother says.
- I'm sitting here.

57
00:03:01,859 --> 00:03:04,663
Oh, he's ashamed of us.
But he doesn't mind us paying, does he?

58
00:03:04,763 --> 00:03:07,973
Don't you two start. Should I save
the juicepack or have it now?

59
00:03:08,073 --> 00:03:09,850
Look, it's peach and clementine!

60
00:03:10,525 --> 00:03:12,842
Ladies and gentlemen
and variations thereupon,

61
00:03:12,942 --> 00:03:16,689
welcome on board the Crusader 50,
if you would fasten your seatbelts,

62
00:03:16,789 --> 00:03:18,650
we'll be leaving any moment.

63
00:03:19,315 --> 00:03:19,970
Doors!

64
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:23,890
Shields down!

65
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:32,118
I'm afraid the view is shielded
until we reach the Waterfall Palace.

66
00:03:32,525 --> 00:03:35,141
Also, a reminder, Midnight has no air,

67
00:03:35,241 --> 00:03:38,420
so please don't touch
the exterior door seals.

68
00:03:38,889 --> 00:03:41,099
Fire exit at the rear,
and should we need to use it...

69
00:03:41,368 --> 00:03:42,530
you first.

70
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:46,511
Now I will hand you
over to Driver Joe...

71
00:03:47,087 --> 00:03:48,125
<i>Driver Joe at the wheel!</i>

72
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:50,745
<i>There's been a diamondfall
at the Winter Witch Canyon,</i>

73
00:03:50,845 --> 00:03:54,005
<i>so we'll be taking a slight detour,
as you'll see on the map.</i>

74
00:03:54,418 --> 00:03:57,371
<i>The journey covers 500
kliks to the Multifaceted Coast,</i>

75
00:03:57,690 --> 00:04:00,380
<i>duration is estimated at four hours.</i>

76
00:04:00,706 --> 00:04:02,195
<i>Thank you for travelling with us,</i>

77
00:04:02,295 --> 00:04:05,400
<i>and as they used to say
in the olden days, wagons roll!</i>

78
00:04:13,219 --> 00:04:14,321
<i>For your entertainment,</i>

79
00:04:14,421 --> 00:04:18,375
we have the Music Channel
playing retrovids of Earth Classics.

80
00:04:19,051 --> 00:04:21,854
# "Do It Do It Again" #
by Raffaella Carra

81
00:04:21,954 --> 00:04:25,690
Also, the latest artistic
installation from Ludovic Klein.

82
00:04:28,062 --> 00:04:30,867
<i>Plus, for the youngsters,
a rare treat : </i>

83
00:04:30,967 --> 00:04:32,450
the Animation Archives.

84
00:04:33,156 --> 00:04:36,510
Four hours of funtime!
Enjoy!

85
00:05:05,410 --> 00:05:06,667
Well, that's a mercy!

86
00:05:06,767 --> 00:05:11,254
I do apologise, ladies and gentlemen
and variations thereupon.

87
00:05:11,354 --> 00:05:13,802
We seem to have had a failure
of the Entertainment System...

88
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:14,715
Aw...

89
00:05:14,815 --> 00:05:17,493
- But what do we do?!
- We've got four hours of this!

90
00:05:17,593 --> 00:05:19,614
Four hours of just sitting here!

91
00:05:19,714 --> 00:05:23,250
Tell you what! We'll have to talk
to each other instead!

92
00:05:28,272 --> 00:05:30,863
98 KLIKS LATER...

93
00:05:33,639 --> 00:05:35,109
<i>So Biff said, "I'm going swimming".</i>

94
00:05:35,209 --> 00:05:38,481
Oh, I was all ready,
trunks and everything! Nose plug!

95
00:05:38,581 --> 00:05:40,909
He had this little nose plug,
you should've seen him.

96
00:05:41,009 --> 00:05:43,092
I went marching up to the lifeguard,

97
00:05:43,192 --> 00:05:46,236
and he was a Shamboni,
you know, those big foreheads?

98
00:05:46,393 --> 00:05:47,707
<i>Great big forehead!</i>

99
00:05:47,807 --> 00:05:49,759
And I said, where's the pool?

100
00:05:49,859 --> 00:05:52,612
And he said, "The pool is abstract!"

101
00:05:54,743 --> 00:05:56,108
It wasn't a real pool!

102
00:05:56,208 --> 00:05:58,605
- It was a concept!
- And you wore a nose plug!

103
00:05:58,705 --> 00:06:01,126
I was like this!
Mmm... where's the pool?

104
00:06:04,571 --> 00:06:07,574
150 KLIKS LATER...

105
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,701
<i>I'm just a second-year student,</i>

106
00:06:09,801 --> 00:06:12,220
but I wrote a paper on
the Lost Moon of Poosh,

107
00:06:12,486 --> 00:06:15,580
Professor Hobbes read it, liked it,
took me on as a researcher.

108
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,386
Just for the holidays. Well...

109
00:06:17,486 --> 00:06:21,297
I say researcher, most of the time
he's got me fetching and carrying.

110
00:06:21,397 --> 00:06:24,046
- But it's all good experience!
- And did they ever find it?

111
00:06:24,146 --> 00:06:26,335
- Find what?
- The Lost Moon of Poosh!

112
00:06:26,867 --> 00:06:28,193
No! Not yet!

113
00:06:28,293 --> 00:06:32,375
Well, maybe that'll be your great
discovery, one day. Here's to Poosh!

114
00:06:32,695 --> 00:06:33,757
Poosh!

115
00:06:34,213 --> 00:06:35,871
209 KLIKS LATER...

116
00:06:35,971 --> 00:06:38,540
No, no, I'm with this
friend of mine,

117
00:06:38,705 --> 00:06:41,415
Donna, she stayed behind
in the Leisure Palace. You?

118
00:06:41,515 --> 00:06:42,980
No, it's just me.

119
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:45,055
Oh, I've done plenty of that.

120
00:06:45,328 --> 00:06:46,940
Travelling on my own.

121
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,289
I love it.

122
00:06:48,389 --> 00:06:51,223
- Do what you want! Go anywhere!
- I'm still getting used to it.

123
00:06:51,967 --> 00:06:55,215
I've... found myself single,
rather recently. Not by choice.

124
00:06:55,407 --> 00:06:57,530
- What happened?
- Oh, the usual.

125
00:06:57,865 --> 00:07:00,330
She needed her own
space, as they say.

126
00:07:01,018 --> 00:07:02,825
A different galaxy, in fact.

127
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:05,127
I reckon that's enough space, don't you?

128
00:07:05,469 --> 00:07:06,129
Yeah.

129
00:07:07,481 --> 00:07:09,508
I had a friend who went
to a different universe.

130
00:07:11,069 --> 00:07:13,769
Oh, what's this, chicken or beef?

131
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:15,760
I think it's both.

132
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:20,339
251 KLIKS LATER...

133
00:07:20,439 --> 00:07:22,666
<i>So this is Midnight, d'you see?</i>

134
00:07:22,766 --> 00:07:28,295
Bombarded by the sun!
X-tonic rays, raw Galvanic Radiation...

135
00:07:28,974 --> 00:07:30,375
<i>Dee Dee, next slide!</i>

136
00:07:31,417 --> 00:07:32,980
<i>It's my pet project.</i>

137
00:07:33,445 --> 00:07:36,917
Actually, I'm the first person
to research this.

138
00:07:37,017 --> 00:07:38,480
Because you see...

139
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:43,097
..the history is fascinating,

140
00:07:44,018 --> 00:07:46,180
because there is no history.

141
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:49,700
There's no life in this entire system,
there couldn't be.

142
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:52,429
Before the Leisure Palace
Company moved in,

143
00:07:52,529 --> 00:07:56,255
no-one had come here in all eternity.

144
00:07:56,648 --> 00:07:58,683
No living thing...

145
00:08:01,755 --> 00:08:03,060
But how d'you know?

146
00:08:03,466 --> 00:08:05,177
I mean, if no-one can go outside...

147
00:08:05,277 --> 00:08:06,904
Oh, his imagination! Here we go!

148
00:08:07,004 --> 00:08:08,891
- He's got a point, though.
- Exactly!

149
00:08:08,991 --> 00:08:13,509
We look upon this world through glass.
Safe inside our metal box.

150
00:08:13,609 --> 00:08:16,810
Even the Leisure Palace
was lowered down from orbit.

151
00:08:17,225 --> 00:08:20,055
And here we are now,
crossing Midnight...

152
00:08:20,628 --> 00:08:22,536
but never touching it.

153
00:08:26,819 --> 00:08:28,090
We've stopped.

154
00:08:30,709 --> 00:08:31,960
<i>Have we stopped?</i>

155
00:08:33,193 --> 00:08:33,981
<i>Are we there?</i>

156
00:08:34,081 --> 00:08:35,420
We can't be, it's too soon.

157
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:38,607
<i>They don't stop,
Crusader vehicles never stop.</i>

158
00:08:38,963 --> 00:08:42,810
If you could just return to your seats,
it's just a small delay.

159
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:49,490
- Maybe just a pit stop.
- What's going on?

160
00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:52,878
There's no pit to stop in, I've been
on this expedition 14 times,

161
00:08:52,978 --> 00:08:53,804
they never stop.

162
00:08:53,904 --> 00:08:56,947
Evidently, we have stopped,
so there's no point in denying it.

163
00:08:57,913 --> 00:09:00,171
- We've broken down!
- Thanks, Jethro.

164
00:09:00,271 --> 00:09:02,466
- In the middle of nowhere!
- That's enough, stop it!

165
00:09:02,566 --> 00:09:05,349
Ladies and gentlemen
and variations thereupon,

166
00:09:05,449 --> 00:09:08,030
we're just experiencing a short...

167
00:09:08,268 --> 00:09:11,622
delay, the driver needs
to stabilise the engine feeds.

168
00:09:11,931 --> 00:09:14,593
Perfectly routine, so if you could
just stay in your seats...

169
00:09:14,693 --> 00:09:16,639
- No, I'm sorry sir...
- There you go,

170
00:09:16,739 --> 00:09:20,055
- engine expert Two ticks!
- Sorry, sir, if you could sit down!

171
00:09:20,257 --> 00:09:22,278
- You're not supposed...
- If you could return...

172
00:09:22,378 --> 00:09:24,290
Company insurance,
let's get an assessment...

173
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:26,401
So, what's the problem, Driver Joe?

174
00:09:26,501 --> 00:09:28,860
We're stabilising the engine feeds,
won't take long.

175
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:32,411
Um, no, cos that's the engine feed,
that light there, and it's fine,

176
00:09:32,511 --> 00:09:35,239
and it's a micropetrol engine,
so stabilising doesn't make sense?

177
00:09:35,339 --> 00:09:38,262
Soory, I'm a doctor. I'm very clever.
So what's wrong?

178
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:41,266
We just stopped, look, all systems fine
and everything's working,

179
00:09:41,366 --> 00:09:42,880
but we're not moving.

180
00:09:43,355 --> 00:09:45,997
You're right.
No faults. And who are you?

181
00:09:46,378 --> 00:09:48,970
Claude, I'm the mechanic. Trainee.

182
00:09:49,382 --> 00:09:50,714
Nice to meet you.

183
00:09:50,814 --> 00:09:54,107
I've sent a distress signal. They should
dispatch a rescue truck, top speed.

184
00:09:54,207 --> 00:09:56,375
- How long till they get here?
- About an hour.

185
00:09:56,672 --> 00:09:58,711
Well, since we're waiting...

186
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:01,203
shall we take a look outside?

187
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:04,580
Lift the screens a bit?

188
00:10:04,888 --> 00:10:07,820
It's 100% X-tonic out there,
we'd be vaporised.

189
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:11,858
No, those windows are Finitoglass,
give you a couple of minutes. Go on!

190
00:10:12,571 --> 00:10:13,890
Live a little!

191
00:10:28,564 --> 00:10:30,055
<i>That is beautiful...</i>

192
00:10:30,788 --> 00:10:32,340
<i>Look at all those diamonds!</i>

193
00:10:32,627 --> 00:10:35,074
<i>Poisoned by the sun.
No-one can ever touch them.</i>

194
00:10:35,174 --> 00:10:36,942
Joe, you said we took a detour?

195
00:10:37,042 --> 00:10:39,972
- Just 40 kliks to the west.
- Is that a recognised path?

196
00:10:40,072 --> 00:10:43,002
No, it's a new one, the computer
worked it out, on automatic.

197
00:10:43,296 --> 00:10:44,766
So we're the first?

198
00:10:45,392 --> 00:10:46,737
<i>This piece of ground.</i>

199
00:10:47,344 --> 00:10:49,155
<i>No-one's ever been here before.</i>

200
00:10:50,825 --> 00:10:53,178
<i>Not in the whole of recorded history.</i>

201
00:10:53,278 --> 00:10:54,335
Did you just...?

202
00:10:56,099 --> 00:10:58,975
- No, sorry. Nothing.
- What did you see?

203
00:10:59,075 --> 00:11:00,540
Just there. That ridge.

204
00:11:01,065 --> 00:11:03,779
<i>Like... a shadow. Just for a second.</i>

205
00:11:04,036 --> 00:11:05,330
What sort of shadow?

206
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,612
X-tonic rising!

207
00:11:07,851 --> 00:11:09,021
Shields down.

208
00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:13,500
Look, there he is, look, there!
- Where ?

209
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:16,009
What was it?

210
00:11:16,109 --> 00:11:19,408
Like, just, something...
shifting, something sort of... dark.

211
00:11:19,828 --> 00:11:21,323
Like it was... running.

212
00:11:21,786 --> 00:11:23,215
Running which way?

213
00:11:23,563 --> 00:11:25,090
Towards us.

214
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:29,335
Doctor, back to your seat
and not a word, rescue's on its way.

215
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:31,805
<i>If you could close the door,
thank you.</i>

216
00:11:35,863 --> 00:11:38,566
What did they say? Did they tell you?
What is it, what's wrong?

217
00:11:38,666 --> 00:11:40,700
Oh, just stabilising,
happens all the time.

218
00:11:40,937 --> 00:11:42,157
I don't need this.

219
00:11:42,364 --> 00:11:44,685
I'm on a schedule.
This is completely unnecessary!

220
00:11:44,785 --> 00:11:46,496
Back to your seats, thank you.

221
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:51,626
Excuse me, Doctor,

222
00:11:52,699 --> 00:11:54,540
but they're micropetrol
engines, aren't they?

223
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:57,007
- Now, don't bother the man.
- My father was a mechanic.

224
00:11:57,719 --> 00:12:00,651
Micropetrol doesn't stabilise,
what does 'stabilise' mean?

225
00:12:00,984 --> 00:12:03,490
Well. Bit of flim-flam.
Don't worry, they're sorting it out.

226
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:06,223
- So it's not the engines?
- Just a little pause, that's all.

227
00:12:06,517 --> 00:12:07,709
<i>How much air have we got?</i>

228
00:12:07,809 --> 00:12:08,697
Professor, it's fine.

229
00:12:08,797 --> 00:12:10,005
- What did he say?
- Nothing!

230
00:12:10,105 --> 00:12:12,401
- Are we running out of air?
- I was just speculating...

231
00:12:12,501 --> 00:12:15,292
- Right miss? Are we running out of air?
- Is that the Captain said?

232
00:12:15,392 --> 00:12:16,568
If you could remain calm...

233
00:12:16,668 --> 00:12:18,445
- How much air have we got?
- Mum, stop it.

234
00:12:18,545 --> 00:12:20,805
- Everything's under control.
- Doesn't look like it!

235
00:12:20,905 --> 00:12:21,581
He said it.

236
00:12:21,681 --> 00:12:23,602
Fine, the air is on a circular filter...

237
00:12:23,702 --> 00:12:26,095
- He started it!
- Everyone...

238
00:12:27,915 --> 00:12:29,340
QUIET!

239
00:12:34,232 --> 00:12:35,127
Thank you.

240
00:12:36,059 --> 00:12:38,962
Now, if you'd care to listen
to my good friend Dee Dee...

241
00:12:40,889 --> 00:12:41,565
Oh!

242
00:12:42,349 --> 00:12:43,194
Um...

243
00:12:43,538 --> 00:12:44,589
It's just that...

244
00:12:44,689 --> 00:12:48,775
Well, the air's on a circular filter so,
we could stay breathing for ten years.

245
00:12:49,525 --> 00:12:50,445
<i>There you go!</i>

246
00:12:51,012 --> 00:12:54,760
And I've spoken to the Captain,
I can guarantee you, everything's fine.

247
00:13:01,610 --> 00:13:02,749
What was that?

248
00:13:02,849 --> 00:13:05,358
It must be the metal.
We're cooling down,

249
00:13:05,658 --> 00:13:07,970
- it's just settling...
- Rocks. Could be rocks falling.

250
00:13:08,070 --> 00:13:10,457
What I want to know is,
how long do we have to sit here.

251
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,309
- What is that?
- Someone's out there!

252
00:13:14,409 --> 00:13:16,724
- Don't be ridiculous!
- Like I said, it could be rocks.

253
00:13:16,824 --> 00:13:19,610
We're in the open.
Nothing could fall against the sides.

254
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:22,770
Knock knock.

255
00:13:23,312 --> 00:13:24,532
Who's there?

256
00:13:30,657 --> 00:13:32,221
<i>Is there something out there?</i>

257
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,174
Well? Anyone?

258
00:13:36,675 --> 00:13:38,164
What the hell is making that noise?

259
00:13:38,264 --> 00:13:41,117
I'm sorry, but the light
out there is X-tonic,

260
00:13:41,587 --> 00:13:45,768
<i>that means it would destroy
any living thing, in a split-second.</i>

261
00:13:45,868 --> 00:13:50,129
<i>It is impossible for
someone to be outside.</i>

262
00:13:54,652 --> 00:13:56,183
What the hell is that, then?!

263
00:13:56,753 --> 00:13:58,952
Sir! You really should
get back to your seat.

264
00:14:04,464 --> 00:14:05,440
Hello?

265
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:10,320
It's moving...

266
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:17,380
It's trying the door.

267
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:21,697
There is no 'it',
there's nothing out there. Can't be.

268
00:14:36,994 --> 00:14:38,639
That's the entrance. Can it get in?

269
00:14:38,739 --> 00:14:40,973
No, that door's on 200
weight of hydraulics.

270
00:14:41,073 --> 00:14:44,495
- Stop it. Don't encourage them.
- What do you think it is?

271
00:14:44,789 --> 00:14:46,655
- Biff, don't...
- Mr Cane, better not...

272
00:14:47,809 --> 00:14:49,058
It's cast iron, that door...

273
00:14:53,324 --> 00:14:56,013
Three times! Did you hear that,
it did it three times?!

274
00:14:56,113 --> 00:14:57,755
- It answered!
- It did it three times!

275
00:14:57,855 --> 00:14:59,344
All right, everyone, calm down.

276
00:14:59,444 --> 00:15:04,125
No, but it answered, don't tell me
that thing's not alive, it answered him!

277
00:15:05,233 --> 00:15:08,460
I really must insist,
you get back to your seats...

278
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,882
No! Don't just stand there
telling us the rules!

279
00:15:10,982 --> 00:15:12,133
You're the hostess,

280
00:15:12,233 --> 00:15:14,255
you're supposed to do something!

281
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,342
What the hell's making that noise?

282
00:15:27,876 --> 00:15:31,554
She said she'd get me. Stop it,
make it stop, somebody make it stop!

283
00:15:31,936 --> 00:15:35,333
Don't stand there looking at me, not
my fault, he started it with stories.

284
00:15:35,433 --> 00:15:37,159
- Calm down!
- He made it worse.

285
00:15:37,259 --> 00:15:40,019
- Why couldn't you leave it alone?
- Stop staring at me!

286
00:15:40,119 --> 00:15:42,400
- Just tell me what it is.
- Calm down!

287
00:15:45,669 --> 00:15:47,017
It's coming for me,

288
00:15:47,899 --> 00:15:50,858
it's coming for me,
it's coming for me...

289
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:55,744
It's coming for me!
It's coming for me.

290
00:15:58,250 --> 00:15:59,390
Get out of there!

291
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:21,610
OK?

292
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:29,861
Arms. Legs. Neck.
Head. Nose. I'm fine...

293
00:16:31,137 --> 00:16:32,439
Everyone else?

294
00:16:34,645 --> 00:16:37,410
How are we?
Everyone all right?

295
00:16:37,842 --> 00:16:39,706
<i>Earthquake, must be...</i>

296
00:16:39,806 --> 00:16:42,847
But that's impossible,
the ground is fixed, it's solid.

297
00:16:42,947 --> 00:16:47,009
Got torches, everyone take a torch,
they're in the back of the seats.

298
00:16:50,826 --> 00:16:53,668
Oh, Jethro, sweetheart, come here...

299
00:16:53,768 --> 00:16:55,764
Never mind me, what about her?

300
00:16:58,510 --> 00:17:00,381
<i>- What happened to the seats?
- Who did that?</i>

301
00:17:00,481 --> 00:17:01,785
<i>They've been ripped up.</i>

302
00:17:04,241 --> 00:17:06,808
It's all right, it's all right,
it's all right, it's over.

303
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:08,447
We're still alive...

304
00:17:08,710 --> 00:17:10,487
<i>Look, the wall's still intact.
D'you see?</i>

305
00:17:10,587 --> 00:17:12,490
- Joe, Claude?
- We're safe.

306
00:17:12,590 --> 00:17:14,222
Driver Joe, can you hear me?

307
00:17:14,716 --> 00:17:17,659
I'm not getting any response,
the intercom must be down.

308
00:17:25,589 --> 00:17:26,859
What happened? What was that?

309
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:29,010
Is it the driver?
Have we lost the driver?

310
00:17:29,743 --> 00:17:31,714
- The cabin's gone.
- Don't be ridiculous.

311
00:17:31,814 --> 00:17:34,636
- It can't be gone, how can it be gone?
- Well, you saw it!

312
00:17:34,736 --> 00:17:37,292
There was nothing there,
like it was ripped away.

313
00:17:37,392 --> 00:17:38,510
What are you doing?

314
00:17:38,610 --> 00:17:40,550
That's bit of light, thank you.
Molto bene!

315
00:17:40,650 --> 00:17:43,415
- You know what you're doing?
- Cabin's gone, leave that wall alone.

316
00:17:43,515 --> 00:17:44,692
The cabin can't be gone!

317
00:17:44,792 --> 00:17:48,140
No, it's safe, any rupture
would automatically seal itself...

318
00:17:50,355 --> 00:17:51,938
But something sliced it off.

319
00:17:53,848 --> 00:17:56,570
- You're right. The cabin's gone.
- But if it gets separated...

320
00:17:56,670 --> 00:17:57,997
<i>It loses integrity.</i>

321
00:18:01,088 --> 00:18:03,165
I'm sorry. They've been reduced to dust.

322
00:18:04,410 --> 00:18:05,769
<i>The driver and the mechanic.</i>

323
00:18:07,302 --> 00:18:08,923
But they sent a distress signal.

324
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:10,731
Help is on its way.
They saved our lives!

325
00:18:10,831 --> 00:18:12,770
We're gonna get out of here, I promise.

326
00:18:13,171 --> 00:18:15,290
<i>We're still alive,
and they're gonna find us.</i>

327
00:18:15,390 --> 00:18:16,682
Doctor. Look at her.

328
00:18:19,417 --> 00:18:21,894
Right, yes, sorry...
Have we got a medical kit?

329
00:18:22,194 --> 00:18:23,426
Why won't she turn around?

330
00:18:26,316 --> 00:18:30,450
- What's her name?
- Silvestry. Mrs Sky Silvestry.

331
00:18:32,072 --> 00:18:32,892
Sky?

332
00:18:34,049 --> 00:18:35,075
Can you hear me?

333
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:36,977
Are you all right?

334
00:18:39,730 --> 00:18:40,831
Can you move, Sky?

335
00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:43,778
Just look at me.

336
00:18:46,744 --> 00:18:48,346
That noise, from outside...

337
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:52,169
- it's stopped.
- Well, thank God for that.

338
00:18:52,269 --> 00:18:54,138
But what if it's
not outside any more?

339
00:18:55,790 --> 00:18:58,320
- What if it's inside?
- Inside? Where?

340
00:18:59,325 --> 00:19:00,620
It was heading for her.

341
00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:02,661
<i>Sky...</i>

342
00:19:03,881 --> 00:19:05,120
it's all right, Sky.

343
00:19:07,366 --> 00:19:08,880
I just want you to turn around,

344
00:19:09,387 --> 00:19:10,250
face me.

345
00:19:47,585 --> 00:19:48,367
Sky?

346
00:19:50,911 --> 00:19:51,737
Sky?

347
00:19:53,688 --> 00:19:55,959
- Are you all right?
- Are you all right?

348
00:19:56,141 --> 00:19:58,050
- Are you hurt?
- Are you hurt?

349
00:19:58,650 --> 00:20:01,096
- You don't have to talk.
- You don't have to talk.

350
00:20:01,471 --> 00:20:03,530
- I'm trying to help.
- I'm trying to help.

351
00:20:03,824 --> 00:20:06,319
- My name's the Doctor.
- My name's the Doctor.

352
00:20:06,651 --> 00:20:09,016
- OK, can you stop?
- OK, can you stop?

353
00:20:09,116 --> 00:20:11,176
- I'd like you to stop.
- I'd like you to stop.

354
00:20:11,276 --> 00:20:13,455
- Why's she doing that?
- Why's she doing that?

355
00:20:13,555 --> 00:20:15,041
- She's gone mad.
- She's gone mad.

356
00:20:15,141 --> 00:20:17,350
- Stop it. I said stop it!
- Stop it. I said stop it!

357
00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:19,490
- I Don't think she can.
- I Don't think she can.

358
00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:21,923
- Stop it, this isn't funny.
- Stop it, this isn't funny.

359
00:20:22,023 --> 00:20:24,012
- Sh, sh, all of you.
- Sh, sh, all of you.

360
00:20:24,112 --> 00:20:25,742
- My name's Jethro!
- My name's Jethro!

361
00:20:25,842 --> 00:20:28,615
- Jethro, leave it, shut up!
- Jethro, leave it, shut up!

362
00:20:34,894 --> 00:20:37,872
- Why are you repeating?
- Why are you repeating?

363
00:20:40,744 --> 00:20:43,170
- What is that, learning?
- What is that, learning?

364
00:20:43,776 --> 00:20:45,501
- Copying?
- Copying?

365
00:20:47,834 --> 00:20:49,899
- Absorbing?
- Absorbing?

366
00:20:52,858 --> 00:20:55,342
- The square root of pi is...
- The square root of pi is...

367
00:20:55,442 --> 00:21:00,735
- 1.77245385090551602729816748...
- 1.77245385090551602729816748...

368
00:21:00,835 --> 00:21:03,170
- 3341. Wow!
- 3341. Wow!

369
00:21:08,195 --> 00:21:10,186
- That's impossible.
- That's impossible.

370
00:21:10,286 --> 00:21:12,038
- She couldn't repeat all that.
- She...

371
00:21:12,138 --> 00:21:13,452
"Tell her to stop!"

372
00:21:13,552 --> 00:21:15,230
"She's driving me mad."

373
00:21:15,330 --> 00:21:16,607
"Make her STOP!"

374
00:21:16,707 --> 00:21:19,253
"Stop her staring at me, shut her up..."

375
00:21:21,118 --> 00:21:22,857
"Telling you, whatever your name is."

376
00:21:22,957 --> 00:21:24,394
"Stop it..."

377
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:27,647
"What's wrong with her eyes?"

378
00:21:34,070 --> 00:21:35,926
"Six, six, six."

379
00:21:46,027 --> 00:21:48,330
- That's the back-up system.
- Well!

380
00:21:49,024 --> 00:21:49,950
That's a bit better.

381
00:21:50,113 --> 00:21:53,604
- What about rescue, how long's?
- About 60 minutes, that's all.

382
00:21:54,436 --> 00:21:57,450
Then I suggest we all calm down.

383
00:21:57,865 --> 00:21:59,598
<i>This panic isn't helping.</i>

384
00:22:00,211 --> 00:22:04,731
<i>That poor woman is evidently
in a state of self-induced hysteria,</i>

385
00:22:04,831 --> 00:22:06,573
- we should leave her alone.
- Doctor...

386
00:22:07,450 --> 00:22:08,254
I know.

387
00:22:08,995 --> 00:22:10,867
Doctor, now step back,

388
00:22:11,542 --> 00:22:13,450
I think you should leave her...

389
00:22:14,474 --> 00:22:15,251
Alone.

390
00:22:18,846 --> 00:22:20,143
What's she doing?

391
00:22:21,684 --> 00:22:22,951
How can she do that?

392
00:22:23,051 --> 00:22:26,090
She's talking with you...
and with me!

393
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:27,631
Oh, my God!

394
00:22:28,442 --> 00:22:29,383
Biff, what's she doing?

395
00:22:29,483 --> 00:22:30,511
She's repeating...

396
00:22:31,727 --> 00:22:34,457
- At exactly the same time.
- That's impossible.

397
00:22:34,557 --> 00:22:37,850
-There's not even a delay.
- Ohh man, that is weird.

398
00:22:38,035 --> 00:22:41,695
I think you should all be very,
very quiet, have you got that?

399
00:22:41,795 --> 00:22:43,908
- How's she doing it?
- Mrs Cane, please, be quiet.

400
00:22:44,008 --> 00:22:47,163
But how can she do that?
She's got my voice, she's got my words!

401
00:22:47,263 --> 00:22:49,475
Sweetheart, be quiet, just...
hush now. Hush.

402
00:22:50,558 --> 00:22:52,639
- She's doing it to me!
- Just stop it, all of you.

403
00:22:52,739 --> 00:22:53,792
Stop it. Please.

404
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:03,760
Now then, Sky. Are you Sky?

405
00:23:04,815 --> 00:23:06,348
Is Sky still in there?

406
00:23:06,448 --> 00:23:07,784
Mrs Silvestry?

407
00:23:10,924 --> 00:23:14,320
You know exactly what I'm going to say,
how are you doing that?

408
00:23:17,394 --> 00:23:18,574
Roast beef!

409
00:23:19,506 --> 00:23:20,482
Bananas!

410
00:23:21,433 --> 00:23:23,185
The Medusa Cascade.

411
00:23:26,319 --> 00:23:27,108
Bang!

412
00:23:27,477 --> 00:23:29,932
Rose Tyler, Martha Jones,
Donna Noble, TARDIS!

413
00:23:32,779 --> 00:23:35,519
Shamble bobble dibble dooble.

414
00:23:36,852 --> 00:23:39,256
Oh, Doctor, you're so handsome.
Yes, I am, thank you.

415
00:23:42,241 --> 00:23:45,400
A, B, C, D, E, F, G,
H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O...

416
00:23:51,474 --> 00:23:54,615
First she repeats. Then she catches up.
What's the next stage?

417
00:23:54,715 --> 00:23:56,091
Next stage of what?

418
00:23:56,191 --> 00:23:59,649
But that's not her, is it?
That's not Mrs Silvestry any more.

419
00:24:00,086 --> 00:24:01,854
I don't think so, no.

420
00:24:05,333 --> 00:24:06,322
I think...

421
00:24:07,298 --> 00:24:09,644
the more we talk,
the more she learns.

422
00:24:09,744 --> 00:24:12,178
Now, I'm all for education,
but in this case...

423
00:24:13,423 --> 00:24:16,911
maybe not. Let's just... move back.
Come on. Come with me.

424
00:24:17,011 --> 00:24:19,055
Everyone, get back,
all of you, as far as you can.

425
00:24:19,155 --> 00:24:20,556
Doctor, make her stop.

426
00:24:20,953 --> 00:24:23,074
Val, come on,
come to the back, stop looking at her,

427
00:24:23,174 --> 00:24:25,570
come on, Jethro, you too,
everyone, come on...

428
00:24:26,330 --> 00:24:27,813
50 minutes. That's all we need.

429
00:24:27,913 --> 00:24:29,940
50 minutes till
the rescue arrives. And...

430
00:24:30,234 --> 00:24:33,500
she's not exactly strong, look at her,
all she's got is our voices.

431
00:24:33,875 --> 00:24:35,753
I can't look at her.
It's those eyes.

432
00:24:40,933 --> 00:24:42,773
We must not look at goblin men.

433
00:24:45,925 --> 00:24:49,498
- What's that supposed to mean?
- It's a poem. Christina Rossetti.

434
00:24:55,298 --> 00:24:58,223
We must not look at goblin men.
We must not buy their fruits.

435
00:24:58,323 --> 00:25:01,946
Who knows upon what soil they fed.
Their hungry, thirsty roots?

436
00:25:03,523 --> 00:25:04,724
I don't think that's helping.

437
00:25:04,824 --> 00:25:08,570
She's not a goblin, or a monster,
she's just a very sick woman.

438
00:25:08,830 --> 00:25:11,769
- Maybe that's why it went for her.
- There is no 'it!'

439
00:25:11,869 --> 00:25:14,460
Think about it. That knocking,
went all the way round the bus.

440
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:15,629
Till it found her.

441
00:25:15,911 --> 00:25:18,102
And she was the most scared,
out of all of us.

442
00:25:19,391 --> 00:25:22,010
Maybe that's what it needed.

443
00:25:22,644 --> 00:25:24,947
- That's how it got in.
- For the last time!

444
00:25:25,470 --> 00:25:28,447
Nothing can live
on the surface of Midnight.

445
00:25:28,547 --> 00:25:31,513
Professor, I'm glad you've got
a definition of life in the universe,

446
00:25:31,613 --> 00:25:34,116
but perhaps the universe
has got ideas of its own, mm?

447
00:25:34,216 --> 00:25:35,963
Now trust me. I've got previous!

448
00:25:36,352 --> 00:25:38,053
I think there might well be some...

449
00:25:38,259 --> 00:25:41,469
consciousness inside Mrs Silvestry,
but maybe SHE's still in there.

450
00:25:41,569 --> 00:25:44,466
- It's our job to help her.
- You can help her, I'm not going near.

451
00:25:44,566 --> 00:25:45,798
No, I've got to stay back.

452
00:25:45,898 --> 00:25:48,608
If she's copying us,
maybe the final stage is becoming us.

453
00:25:48,708 --> 00:25:51,458
I don't want her becoming me,
or things could get a lot worse.

454
00:25:51,558 --> 00:25:54,433
- Oh, like you're so special.
- As it happens, yes, I am.

455
00:25:54,533 --> 00:25:56,898
So that's decided.
We stay back. And we wait.

456
00:25:57,130 --> 00:25:59,395
When the rescue ship comes,
we can get her to hospital.

457
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,130
We should throw her out.

458
00:26:04,876 --> 00:26:06,259
I beg your pardon?

459
00:26:08,267 --> 00:26:10,000
- Can we do that?
- Don't be ridiculous.

460
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:11,702
That thing, whatever it is,

461
00:26:11,802 --> 00:26:14,899
killed the driver, and the mechanic,
and I don't think she's finished yet.

462
00:26:14,999 --> 00:26:17,552
- She can't even move!
- Look, look at her eyes!

463
00:26:17,921 --> 00:26:21,090
She killed Joe,
and she killed Claude, and we're next.

464
00:26:21,190 --> 00:26:23,481
She's still doing it. Just stop it!

465
00:26:23,581 --> 00:26:25,130
Stop talking!! STOP IT!!!

466
00:26:25,230 --> 00:26:27,891
- Biff, don't, sweetheart!
- She won't stop!

467
00:26:28,926 --> 00:26:31,447
We can't throw her out though,
we can't even open the doors.

468
00:26:31,547 --> 00:26:33,412
No-one is getting thrown out!

469
00:26:41,059 --> 00:26:42,066
Yes, we can.

470
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:44,224
<i>Cos there's an air pressure seal.</i>

471
00:26:44,545 --> 00:26:45,859
Like when you opened cabin door,

472
00:26:45,959 --> 00:26:47,954
you weren't pulled out,
you had a couple of sec,

473
00:26:48,054 --> 00:26:50,539
<i>cos it takes the pressure-wall
about six seconds to collapse.</i>

474
00:26:50,639 --> 00:26:52,547
Well, six seconds exactly.

475
00:26:53,216 --> 00:26:55,362
That's enough time to throw someone out.

476
00:26:55,838 --> 00:26:58,841
- Thanks, Dee Dee, just what we needed.
- Would it kill her? Outside?

477
00:26:58,941 --> 00:27:01,933
I don't know, but she's got a body now,
it would kill the physical form.

478
00:27:02,033 --> 00:27:04,180
No-one is killing anyone!

479
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:06,885
I wouldn't risk the cabin door twice.
But we've got that one.

480
00:27:06,985 --> 00:27:09,318
All we need to do is grab hold
of her and throw her out.

481
00:27:09,418 --> 00:27:12,298
Now, listen! For all we know,
that's a brand new lifeform over there.

482
00:27:12,398 --> 00:27:14,975
And if it's come inside to discover us,
than what's it found?

483
00:27:15,382 --> 00:27:18,567
This little bunch of humans,
what d'you amount to?

484
00:27:19,311 --> 00:27:21,927
A murder? Cos this is where you decide.

485
00:27:22,027 --> 00:27:23,729
You decide who you are.

486
00:27:23,923 --> 00:27:26,895
Could you actually murder her?
Any of you?

487
00:27:27,401 --> 00:27:28,052
Really?

488
00:27:30,211 --> 00:27:31,890
Or are you better than that?

489
00:27:40,518 --> 00:27:41,370
I'd do it.

490
00:27:41,538 --> 00:27:42,533
- So would I.
- And me.

491
00:27:42,871 --> 00:27:44,185
- I think we should.
- What?!

492
00:27:44,285 --> 00:27:45,980
- I want her out.
- You can't say that!

493
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:49,134
I'm sorry, but you said it yourself,
Doctor, she is growing in strength.

494
00:27:49,234 --> 00:27:51,502
- That's not what I said!
- I want to go home.

495
00:27:51,934 --> 00:27:54,255
I'm sorry. I want to be safe.

496
00:27:54,355 --> 00:27:56,708
You'll be safe,
the rescue truck is on its way.

497
00:27:56,808 --> 00:27:58,247
<i>What happens then, Doctor?</i>

498
00:27:58,809 --> 00:28:00,934
If it takes that thing back to
the Leisure Palace,

499
00:28:01,034 --> 00:28:03,494
if that thing reaches civilisation,
what if it spreads?

500
00:28:03,594 --> 00:28:05,999
When we get back to the base,
I'll be there to contain it.

501
00:28:06,099 --> 00:28:08,900
- You haven't done much so far!
- You'r standing with the rest of us!

502
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,126
<i>She's dangerous.</i>

503
00:28:10,552 --> 00:28:13,650
It's my job to see this vessel is safe.
We should get rid of her.

504
00:28:13,750 --> 00:28:17,552
Now hang on, I think, perhaps,
we're all going a little bit too far.

505
00:28:17,652 --> 00:28:20,617
- At last! Thank you.
- Two people are dead!

506
00:28:20,717 --> 00:28:22,151
Don't make it a third!

507
00:28:25,723 --> 00:28:27,094
Jethro, what d'you say?

508
00:28:27,463 --> 00:28:29,071
- I'm not killing anyone.
- Thank you.

509
00:28:29,171 --> 00:28:31,054
- He's just a boy!
- What, I don't get a vote?

510
00:28:31,154 --> 00:28:33,130
There isn't a vote,
it's not happening! Ever.

511
00:28:34,626 --> 00:28:37,782
If you try to throw her out that door,
you'll have to get past me first.

512
00:28:41,298 --> 00:28:43,413
- OK.
- Fine by me.

513
00:28:43,513 --> 00:28:45,992
Oh, now you're being stupid.
Just think about it!

514
00:28:46,092 --> 00:28:48,726
Could you take someone
and throw them out of that door?

515
00:28:48,826 --> 00:28:49,655
Calling me a coward?

516
00:28:49,755 --> 00:28:51,650
- Who put you in charge?
- I'm sorry, but...

517
00:28:51,910 --> 00:28:53,753
you're a Doctor of what, exactly?

518
00:28:53,853 --> 00:28:55,104
He wasn't even booked in.

519
00:28:55,204 --> 00:28:58,952
Rest of you, tickets in advance.
He just turned up, out of the blue.

520
00:28:59,152 --> 00:29:00,227
<i>Where from?</i>

521
00:29:00,621 --> 00:29:01,910
I'm just... travelling,

522
00:29:02,010 --> 00:29:03,855
- I'm a traveller..
- Like an immigrant?

523
00:29:03,955 --> 00:29:07,372
Who were you talking to?
Before you got on board, who was that?

524
00:29:07,472 --> 00:29:08,462
Just Donna, my friend.

525
00:29:08,562 --> 00:29:10,784
- What were you saying her?
- Hasn't told us his name.

526
00:29:10,884 --> 00:29:13,230
Thing is, Doctor,
you've been loving this.

527
00:29:13,330 --> 00:29:14,857
Oh, Jethro, not you.

528
00:29:14,957 --> 00:29:17,816
No, but ever since all the trouble
started, you've been loving it.

529
00:29:17,916 --> 00:29:21,575
It has to be said,
you do seem to have a certain...glee.

530
00:29:21,675 --> 00:29:24,201
All right, I'm interested,
yes, I can't help it,

531
00:29:24,301 --> 00:29:26,572
cos whatever's inside her,
it's brand new,

532
00:29:26,672 --> 00:29:29,150
- and that's fascinating.
- What, you wanted this to happen?

533
00:29:29,250 --> 00:29:29,685
No!

534
00:29:29,785 --> 00:29:32,163
You were talking to her,
on your own, before the trouble,

535
00:29:32,263 --> 00:29:34,885
right at the front, you were
talking to that Sky woman,

536
00:29:34,985 --> 00:29:37,133
- the two of you together, I saw you.
- We all did!

537
00:29:37,233 --> 00:29:39,204
- You went in the cabin!
- What you said to her?

538
00:29:39,304 --> 00:29:40,753
- I was talking!
- Saying what?

539
00:29:40,853 --> 00:29:42,792
You called us humans
like you're not one of us.

540
00:29:42,892 --> 00:29:44,945
- He did! That's what he said!
- And the wiring,

541
00:29:45,045 --> 00:29:47,065
he went into that panel
and opened up the wiring.

542
00:29:47,165 --> 00:29:48,060
That was after.

543
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:51,065
- But how did you know what to do?
- Because I'm clever.

544
00:29:56,385 --> 00:29:58,395
I see. Well.

545
00:29:58,939 --> 00:30:00,359
That makes things clear.

546
00:30:00,459 --> 00:30:02,405
And what are we, then? Idiots?

547
00:30:02,505 --> 00:30:03,475
That's not what I meant.

548
00:30:03,575 --> 00:30:04,864
If you're clever what are we?

549
00:30:04,964 --> 00:30:07,220
You've looked down on us
from the moment we walked in.

550
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:09,592
Even if he goes,
he's practically volunteered.

551
00:30:09,692 --> 00:30:12,658
Oh come on,
just listen to yourself, please!

552
00:30:12,758 --> 00:30:13,549
D'you mean...?

553
00:30:14,250 --> 00:30:15,607
We throw him out as well?

554
00:30:23,557 --> 00:30:24,457
If we have to.

555
00:30:25,602 --> 00:30:26,516
Look, just...

556
00:30:27,454 --> 00:30:29,530
Right, sorry, yes, hold on, just...

557
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:34,529
I know, you're scared,
and so am I, look at me, I am.

558
00:30:34,845 --> 00:30:38,865
But we have all got to calm down
and cool off and think.

559
00:30:39,390 --> 00:30:40,942
Perhaps you could tell us your name.

560
00:30:41,042 --> 00:30:42,962
- What does it matter?
- Then tell us.

561
00:30:44,645 --> 00:30:46,402
- John Smith.
- Your real name.

562
00:30:46,502 --> 00:30:48,980
He's lying, look at his face.
His eyes are the same as hers.

563
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:50,932
- Tell us?!
- He's been lying to us,

564
00:30:51,032 --> 00:30:51,964
right from the start.

565
00:30:52,064 --> 00:30:53,447
No-one's called John Smith!

566
00:30:53,547 --> 00:30:55,293
Now listen to me right now!

567
00:30:55,393 --> 00:30:58,949
You need me, all of you, if we're going
to get out of this, then you need me.

568
00:30:59,049 --> 00:31:01,540
So you keep saying!
You've repeated yourself more than her.

569
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:04,361
If anyone's in charge, it should be
the Professor, he's the expert!

570
00:31:04,461 --> 00:31:06,269
Stop, just look...

571
00:31:06,445 --> 00:31:08,368
- You keep out of this, Jethro.
- Look at her!

572
00:31:08,781 --> 00:31:09,920
She's stopped...

573
00:31:15,382 --> 00:31:18,329
When did she...?
No, she hasn't, she's still doing it.

574
00:31:18,585 --> 00:31:19,980
<i>She looks the same to me...</i>

575
00:31:20,351 --> 00:31:22,585
No, she's stopped!

576
00:31:23,417 --> 00:31:25,383
<i>Look, I'm talking, and she's not!</i>

577
00:31:25,483 --> 00:31:26,666
<i>What about me? Is she?</i>

578
00:31:26,766 --> 00:31:30,500
Look! Look at that!
She's not doing me, she's let me go!

579
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:32,115
Mrs Silvestry?

580
00:31:34,283 --> 00:31:35,929
Nor me! Nothing!

581
00:31:37,205 --> 00:31:38,137
Sky?

582
00:31:39,332 --> 00:31:40,265
What are you doing?

583
00:31:40,365 --> 00:31:41,822
She's still doing him!

584
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:45,942
Doctor. It's you.
She's only copying you.

585
00:31:47,187 --> 00:31:49,577
Why me? Why are you doing this?

586
00:31:49,677 --> 00:31:53,537
She won't leave him alone!
D'you see? I said so, she's with him.

587
00:31:53,637 --> 00:31:55,756
- They're together!
- How d'you explain it, Doctor?

588
00:31:55,925 --> 00:31:58,109
- If you're so clever.
- I don't know.

589
00:31:59,285 --> 00:32:00,592
Sky, stop it.

590
00:32:01,493 --> 00:32:03,564
I said stop it. Just stop it!

591
00:32:03,664 --> 00:32:05,124
<i>Look at the two of them...</i>

592
00:32:07,718 --> 00:32:10,660
Mrs Silvestry. I'm trying to understand.

593
00:32:11,647 --> 00:32:14,194
<i>You've captured my speech, what for?</i>

594
00:32:15,439 --> 00:32:16,821
What d'you need?

595
00:32:19,953 --> 00:32:22,431
You need my voice in particular.

596
00:32:22,718 --> 00:32:24,533
The cleverest voice in the room.

597
00:32:24,989 --> 00:32:28,026
Why? Cos I'm the only
one who can help?

598
00:32:28,864 --> 00:32:31,812
Oh, I'd love that to be true.
But your eyes.

599
00:32:32,744 --> 00:32:34,230
They're saying something else.

600
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:38,988
Listen to me.
Whatever you want, if it's life,

601
00:32:39,088 --> 00:32:44,047
or form, or consciousness,
or voice, you don't have to steal it.

602
00:32:44,147 --> 00:32:46,800
You can find it
without hurting anyone.

603
00:32:47,858 --> 00:32:49,240
And I'll help you.

604
00:32:49,941 --> 00:32:51,439
That's a promise.

605
00:32:52,033 --> 00:32:52,722
So.

606
00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:55,135
What d'you think?

607
00:32:56,411 --> 00:32:58,601
- Do we have a deal?
- Do we have a deal?

608
00:33:03,371 --> 00:33:05,855
- Hold on, did she...?
- She spoke first.

609
00:33:05,955 --> 00:33:06,840
She can't have.

610
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:08,730
<i>- She did!
- She spoke first!</i>

611
00:33:11,494 --> 00:33:17,087
Oh, look at that, I'm ahead of you.
Oh, look at that, I'm ahead of you.

612
00:33:17,187 --> 00:33:21,385
Did you see? She spoke
before he did! Definitely!

613
00:33:21,610 --> 00:33:22,827
He's copying her.

614
00:33:23,959 --> 00:33:25,880
<i>Doctor? What's happening?</i>

615
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:29,241
- I think it's moved.
- I think it's moved.

616
00:33:29,341 --> 00:33:32,307
- I think it's letting me go.
- I think it's letting me go.

617
00:33:33,730 --> 00:33:36,532
<i>What do you mean?
Letting you go from what?</i>

618
00:33:36,632 --> 00:33:39,220
<i>But he's repeating now,
he's the one doing it! It's him!</i>

619
00:33:39,976 --> 00:33:41,108
<i>They're separating.</i>

620
00:33:41,846 --> 00:33:43,141
<i>Mrs Silvestry?</i>

621
00:33:44,142 --> 00:33:45,277
Is that you?

622
00:33:45,490 --> 00:33:49,288
Yes, yes, it's me.

623
00:33:49,450 --> 00:33:50,889
Yes, yes, it's me...

624
00:33:50,989 --> 00:33:53,067
I'm coming back, listen.

625
00:33:53,167 --> 00:33:54,498
- I'm coming back...
- It's me!

626
00:33:54,598 --> 00:33:56,369
Listen. It's me!

627
00:33:56,820 --> 00:34:00,073
Like it's passed into the Doctor.
It's transferred. Whatever it is,

628
00:34:00,565 --> 00:34:01,820
it's gone inside him.

629
00:34:02,463 --> 00:34:04,991
No, that's not what happened.

630
00:34:09,554 --> 00:34:10,836
But look at her!

631
00:34:13,502 --> 00:34:16,317
Look at me, I can move...

632
00:34:16,417 --> 00:34:18,446
- Look at me...
- I can feel again...

633
00:34:18,621 --> 00:34:20,736
- I'm coming back to life.
- I can move...

634
00:34:20,836 --> 00:34:21,872
I can feel again.

635
00:34:21,972 --> 00:34:23,893
- And look at him.
- I'm coming back to life.

636
00:34:23,993 --> 00:34:27,410
- He can't move.
- And look at him, he can't move.

637
00:34:32,141 --> 00:34:33,993
- Help me.
- Help me.

638
00:34:34,093 --> 00:34:35,720
- Professor?
- Professor?

639
00:34:35,914 --> 00:34:38,898
<i>- Get me away from him.
- Get me away from him.</i>

640
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:41,344
- Please.
- Please.

641
00:34:54,909 --> 00:34:57,355
<i>Oh, thank you.</i>

642
00:34:57,455 --> 00:34:59,320
Oh, thank you.

643
00:34:59,420 --> 00:35:00,658
<i>They've completely separated.</i>

644
00:35:00,758 --> 00:35:03,980
It's in him, d'you see?
I said it was him all the time.

645
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:06,353
She's free! She's been saved!

646
00:35:06,453 --> 00:35:09,550
- Oh, it was so cold.
- Oh, it was so cold.

647
00:35:09,813 --> 00:35:12,193
- I couldn't breathe.
- I couldn't breathe.

648
00:35:12,293 --> 00:35:13,990
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.

649
00:35:14,090 --> 00:35:15,846
I must've scared you, so much.

650
00:35:15,946 --> 00:35:17,742
<i>I must've scared you, so much.</i>

651
00:35:17,842 --> 00:35:21,355
No, no, it's all right,
I've got you, ooh, there you are,

652
00:35:21,455 --> 00:35:23,858
my love, it's gone,
everything's all right now.

653
00:35:23,958 --> 00:35:24,905
I wouldn't touch her.

654
00:35:25,005 --> 00:35:26,940
But it's gone, she's clean,
it passed into him.

655
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:28,202
That's not what happened.

656
00:35:28,302 --> 00:35:30,054
Thank you for your opinion, Dee,

657
00:35:30,154 --> 00:35:33,300
but clearly, Mrs Silvestry
has been released.

658
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:35,249
- No.
- Just leave her alone!

659
00:35:35,474 --> 00:35:37,194
She's safe, isn't she?

660
00:35:37,757 --> 00:35:41,060
- Jethro? It's let her go, hasn't it?
- I think so, yeah.

661
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:43,700
Looks like it. Professor?

662
00:35:44,368 --> 00:35:46,583
I'd say, from observation...

663
00:35:46,996 --> 00:35:48,910
the Doctor can't move,

664
00:35:49,173 --> 00:35:52,220
and when she was possessed,
she couldn't move, so...

665
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:53,524
Well, there we are then!

666
00:35:54,162 --> 00:35:56,890
Now the only problem
we've got is this Doctor.

667
00:35:58,266 --> 00:36:01,493
- It's inside his head.
- It's inside his head.

668
00:36:02,885 --> 00:36:05,438
- It killed the driver.
- It killed the driver.

669
00:36:05,538 --> 00:36:07,711
- And the mechanic.
- And the mechanic.

670
00:36:07,811 --> 00:36:09,328
And now it wants us.

671
00:36:09,428 --> 00:36:11,765
- And now it wants us.
- I said so!

672
00:36:11,927 --> 00:36:14,899
- He's waited so long.
- He's waited so long.

673
00:36:14,999 --> 00:36:16,632
- In the dark.
- In the dark.

674
00:36:16,732 --> 00:36:18,765
- And the cold.
- And the cold.

675
00:36:18,865 --> 00:36:21,230
- And the diamonds.
- And the diamonds.

676
00:36:21,330 --> 00:36:23,577
- Until you came.
- Until you came.

677
00:36:23,677 --> 00:36:25,354
Bodies so hot.

678
00:36:25,454 --> 00:36:26,512
Bodies so hot.

679
00:36:26,612 --> 00:36:28,433
- With blood.
- With blood.

680
00:36:28,533 --> 00:36:30,259
- And pain.
- And pain.

681
00:36:30,359 --> 00:36:31,461
Someone make him stop.

682
00:36:31,561 --> 00:36:33,694
- But she's saying it!
- And you can shut up!

683
00:36:33,794 --> 00:36:36,397
It's not him, it's her,
he's just repeating!

684
00:36:36,497 --> 00:36:38,287
But that's what the
thing does, it repeats!

685
00:36:38,387 --> 00:36:40,458
- Let her talk.
- What do you know?

686
00:36:40,690 --> 00:36:41,841
Fat lot of good you've been!

687
00:36:41,941 --> 00:36:43,712
Just let her explain.

688
00:36:44,350 --> 00:36:45,457
I think...

689
00:36:46,108 --> 00:36:47,732
I mean, from what I've seen...

690
00:36:47,832 --> 00:36:50,677
it repeats, then it synchronises,
then it goes on to the next stage

691
00:36:50,777 --> 00:36:52,660
that's exactly what
the Doctor said would...

692
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:54,576
- What, and you're on his side?
- No!

693
00:36:54,676 --> 00:36:57,215
- The voice is the thing!
- And she's the voice!

694
00:36:57,404 --> 00:36:59,660
She stole it! Look at her!

695
00:37:00,194 --> 00:37:02,503
It's not possessing him,
it's draining him!

696
00:37:02,816 --> 00:37:03,873
She's got his voice...

697
00:37:03,973 --> 00:37:06,032
<i>That's not true,
I saw it pass into him,</i>

698
00:37:06,132 --> 00:37:08,021
- I saw it with my own eyes!
- So did I!

699
00:37:08,121 --> 00:37:10,280
- You didn't!
- It went from her, to him.

700
00:37:10,643 --> 00:37:11,882
You saw it, didn't you?

701
00:37:11,982 --> 00:37:13,728
- I don't know.
- Don't be stupid, Jethro,

702
00:37:13,828 --> 00:37:14,786
of course you did!

703
00:37:15,005 --> 00:37:17,340
- I suppose he was right next to her.
- Everyone saw it!

704
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:19,222
<i>But you're just making it up!</i>

705
00:37:19,322 --> 00:37:22,862
I know what I saw,
and I saw her stealing his voice.

706
00:37:22,962 --> 00:37:24,789
She's as bad as him,
someone shut her up.

707
00:37:24,889 --> 00:37:26,322
I think you should be quiet, Dee.

708
00:37:26,422 --> 00:37:28,318
- I'm only saying...
- And that's an order!

709
00:37:28,849 --> 00:37:30,513
<i>You're making a fool of yourself!</i>

710
00:37:30,613 --> 00:37:33,516
Pretending you're an expert
in mechanics and hydraulics,

711
00:37:33,616 --> 00:37:38,221
<i>when I can tell you, you are
nothing more than average, at best!</i>

712
00:37:38,402 --> 00:37:40,155
Now shut up!

713
00:37:40,255 --> 00:37:42,479
- That's how he does it.
- That's how he does it.

714
00:37:42,579 --> 00:37:44,781
- He makes you fight.
- He makes you fight.

715
00:37:44,881 --> 00:37:47,840
- Creeps into your head.
- Creeps into your head.

716
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:50,073
- And whispers.
- And whispers.

717
00:37:50,173 --> 00:37:51,380
- Listen.
- Listen.

718
00:37:51,650 --> 00:37:53,258
- Just listen.
- Just listen.

719
00:37:53,358 --> 00:37:55,373
- That's him.
- That's him.

720
00:37:55,473 --> 00:37:57,419
- Inside.
- Inside.

721
00:37:57,519 --> 00:37:59,940
- Get him out of my head!
- Yeah, we should throw him out!

722
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:01,931
Don't just talk about it!
Don't be so useless!

723
00:38:02,031 --> 00:38:04,346
- Do something!
- I will! You watch me!

724
00:38:04,446 --> 00:38:05,585
<i>I'm gonna throw him out!</i>

725
00:38:05,685 --> 00:38:06,987
- Yes!
- Yes!

726
00:38:07,087 --> 00:38:08,733
- Throw him out!
- Throw him out!

727
00:38:08,833 --> 00:38:10,929
- Get rid of him!
- Get rid of him!

728
00:38:11,029 --> 00:38:12,581
- Now!
- Now!

729
00:38:14,401 --> 00:38:16,128
- Don't!
- It'll be you next!

730
00:38:17,267 --> 00:38:18,774
I don't think we should do this.

731
00:38:18,874 --> 00:38:21,202
It was your idea!
Professor, help me.

732
00:38:21,302 --> 00:38:22,185
I can't...

733
00:38:22,285 --> 00:38:24,956
- I'm not...
- What sort of a man are you? Come on!

734
00:38:25,056 --> 00:38:28,140
Throw him out!
Just do it, throw him out!

735
00:38:28,588 --> 00:38:30,133
- Professor, help me.
- Get him out!

736
00:38:30,233 --> 00:38:32,511
Grab hold of him...
Not like that!! Are you stupid?!!

737
00:38:32,611 --> 00:38:34,337
- Cast him out!
- Cast him out!

738
00:38:34,437 --> 00:38:36,290
- Into the sun!
- Into the sun!

739
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:39,530
- And the night!
- And the night!

740
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:42,863
Come on.
Don't just stand there!

741
00:38:42,963 --> 00:38:45,141
- Do something say!!
- Get him out!

742
00:38:45,241 --> 00:38:46,373
- Do it!
- Do it!

743
00:38:46,473 --> 00:38:48,198
- Do it now!
- Do it now!

744
00:38:48,298 --> 00:38:50,063
- Faster!
- Faster!

745
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:50,990
Just do it!

746
00:38:51,090 --> 00:38:53,410
- That's the way!
- That's the way!

747
00:38:53,510 --> 00:38:55,660
- You can do it!
- You can do it!

748
00:38:56,653 --> 00:39:00,706
- Molto bene!
- Molto bene!

749
00:39:00,806 --> 00:39:01,510
<i>Get him out!</i>

750
00:39:01,610 --> 00:39:04,642
- Allons-y!
- Allons-y!

751
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:06,350
That's his voice.

752
00:39:06,450 --> 00:39:09,130
- The starlight waits!
- She's taken his voice.

753
00:39:09,707 --> 00:39:12,034
- The emptiness!
- Get him out!

754
00:39:12,134 --> 00:39:13,961
The Midnight sky!

755
00:39:14,061 --> 00:39:15,456
<i>The Midnight sky!</i>

756
00:39:15,556 --> 00:39:16,582
It's her.

757
00:39:22,759 --> 00:39:24,675
She's taken his voice!

758
00:39:28,605 --> 00:39:34,035
One, two, three, four, five, six.

759
00:39:38,874 --> 00:39:40,957
It's gone, it's gone...

760
00:39:42,315 --> 00:39:44,173
It's gone, it's gone, it's gone...

761
00:39:44,630 --> 00:39:45,590
It's gone.

762
00:39:46,088 --> 00:39:47,085
It's gone...

763
00:39:50,020 --> 00:39:51,605
<i>It's gone, it's gone, it's gone...</i>

764
00:39:52,304 --> 00:39:54,215
It's gone, it's gone, it's gone...

765
00:40:30,575 --> 00:40:31,775
I said it was her.

766
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:51,805
20 MINUTES LATER...

767
00:40:53,641 --> 00:40:59,147
<i>Repeat, Crusader 50, rescue vehicle
coming alongside in three minutes,</i>

768
00:40:59,653 --> 00:41:01,968
<i>door-seals set to automatic.</i>

769
00:41:02,506 --> 00:41:06,975
<i>Prepare for boarding,
repeat, prepare for boarding.</i>

770
00:41:08,041 --> 00:41:09,045
The Hostess...

771
00:41:11,639 --> 00:41:13,090
what was her name?

772
00:41:23,724 --> 00:41:24,794
I don't know.

773
00:41:57,728 --> 00:41:58,973
<i>What d'you think it was?</i>

774
00:42:01,763 --> 00:42:02,758
No idea.

775
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:05,661
D'you think it's still out there?

776
00:42:09,919 --> 00:42:11,546
Well, you'd better tell 'em.

777
00:42:12,146 --> 00:42:13,805
- This lot.
- Yeah.

778
00:42:14,174 --> 00:42:16,338
They can build a Leisure
Palace somewhere else.

779
00:42:17,104 --> 00:42:18,824
Let this planet keep on turning.

780
00:42:18,924 --> 00:42:20,945
Round an X-tonic star.

781
00:42:21,790 --> 00:42:23,041
In silence.

782
00:42:25,068 --> 00:42:26,958
Can't imagine you, without a voice.

783
00:42:28,309 --> 00:42:29,605
Molto bene.

784
00:42:30,930 --> 00:42:32,325
Molto bene!

785
00:42:32,707 --> 00:42:34,265
No, don't do that.

786
00:42:36,178 --> 00:42:36,975
Don't.

787
00:42:40,733 --> 00:42:41,609
Don't.

788
00:42:48,757 --> 00:42:50,897
Found a body, sir.
The Doctor is dead.

789
00:42:51,147 --> 00:42:53,581
<i>How could anything...
be worse than this?</i>

790
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,821
What happened, what did they find?

791
00:42:55,921 --> 00:42:58,510
Oh, my God. The stars are going out.

792
00:42:58,610 --> 00:43:01,198
- Who are you?
- I was like you.

793
00:43:01,298 --> 00:43:04,470
- Turn around... show me your back.
- I've been pulled across

794
00:43:04,625 --> 00:43:07,448
from a different universe because
every single universe is in danger.

795
00:43:07,548 --> 00:43:09,883
There's something on your back.

796
00:43:10,233 --> 00:43:13,017
- What am I supposed to do?!
- Powering up...

797
00:43:13,825 --> 00:43:16,846
None of this... was meant to happen.
You're going to die.

798
