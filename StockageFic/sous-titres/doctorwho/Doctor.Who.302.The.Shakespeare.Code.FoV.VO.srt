1
00:00:01,296 --> 00:00:05,310
# This was like a winter moon

2
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:09,730
# That lights the traveller's way

3
00:00:10,056 --> 00:00:14,520
# Her smile was like
a summer bloom

4
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:19,630
# That bursts then fades away

5
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:22,470
# My love is night

6
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:26,040
# My love is day, my love

7
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:28,793
# She is my world. #

8
00:00:29,096 --> 00:00:32,042
Such sweet music
shows your blood to be afire.

9
00:00:32,582 --> 00:00:34,627
Why wait we on stale
custom for consummation?

10
00:00:35,283 --> 00:00:36,248
Oh yes,

11
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:37,888
tonight's the night!

12
00:00:43,729 --> 00:00:45,562
Would you enter, bold sir?

13
00:00:46,449 --> 00:00:47,607
Oh, I would!

14
00:00:52,675 --> 00:00:53,447
Lilith,

15
00:00:54,334 --> 00:00:56,881
this cannot be
the home of one so beautiful?

16
00:00:57,170 --> 00:00:58,182
Forgive me,

17
00:00:58,240 --> 00:00:59,668
this is foul.

18
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:00,440
Sssh,

19
00:01:01,636 --> 00:01:03,903
sad words suit not
upon a lover's tongue.

20
00:01:11,039 --> 00:01:13,200
Oh, your kiss transformed me!

21
00:01:13,296 --> 00:01:15,746
A suitor should meet
his beloved's parents -

22
00:01:16,325 --> 00:01:18,119
Mother Doomfinger!

23
00:01:20,604 --> 00:01:22,630
And Mother Bloodtide!

24
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:36,258
Soon,

25
00:01:36,415 --> 00:01:38,865
at the Hour of Woven Words,

26
00:01:38,955 --> 00:01:40,418
we shall rise again,

27
00:01:40,531 --> 00:01:43,795
and this fleeting Earth
will perish!

28
00:02:26,172 --> 00:02:29,122
But how do you travel
in time, what makes it go?

29
00:02:29,234 --> 00:02:32,646
Oh, take the fun and the mystery out
of everything. It just does!

30
00:02:32,781 --> 00:02:33,974
Hold on tight!

31
00:02:37,608 --> 00:02:39,972
Blimey! D'you have to pass a test to
fly this thing?

32
00:02:40,062 --> 00:02:44,993
Yes, and I failed.
Now, make the most of it, I promised
you one trip and one trip only.

33
00:02:45,061 --> 00:02:46,051
Outside this door...

34
00:02:47,651 --> 00:02:48,732
brave new world.

35
00:02:49,227 --> 00:02:49,947
Where are we?

36
00:02:51,141 --> 00:02:51,937
Take a look...

37
00:02:53,694 --> 00:02:54,639
After you.

38
00:03:01,866 --> 00:03:03,648
Oh, you're kidding me.

39
00:03:03,828 --> 00:03:05,440
You're so. . .

40
00:03:05,441 --> 00:03:07,674
kidding me.
Oh, my God. We did it!

41
00:03:07,696 --> 00:03:09,610
We travelled in time.

42
00:03:11,478 --> 00:03:12,248
Where are we?

43
00:03:12,428 --> 00:03:13,711
No, sorry,

44
00:03:13,824 --> 00:03:15,985
gotta get used to this,
whole new language.

45
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,201
WHEN are we?

46
00:03:17,291 --> 00:03:17,741
Mind out!

47
00:03:17,831 --> 00:03:18,732
Gardez-loo!

48
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:22,396
Somewhere before the invention
of the toilet.

49
00:03:22,509 --> 00:03:23,319
Sorry about that.

50
00:03:23,544 --> 00:03:26,539
I've seen worse, I've worked the
late night-shift in A&E.

51
00:03:27,057 --> 00:03:28,168
But, are we safe?

52
00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:30,419
I mean,
can we move around and stuff?

53
00:03:30,554 --> 00:03:31,770
Course we can, why'd you ask?

54
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:36,025
In those films, you
step on a butterfly, you change
the future of the human race.

55
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:37,474
Tell you what then,

56
00:03:38,036 --> 00:03:40,378
don't
step on any butterflies. What have
butterflies ever done to you?

57
00:03:41,211 --> 00:03:43,170
What if, I dunno,

58
00:03:43,305 --> 00:03:45,038
what if I kill my grandfather?

59
00:03:45,173 --> 00:03:46,074
Are you planning to?

60
00:03:46,164 --> 00:03:46,682
No!

61
00:03:46,817 --> 00:03:47,335
Well then.

62
00:03:48,513 --> 00:03:50,067
This is London?

63
00:03:50,068 --> 00:03:51,035
Think so,

64
00:03:51,147 --> 00:03:54,637
round about, em, ooh, 1599.

65
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:57,249
Oh, but hold on, am I all right?

66
00:03:57,414 --> 00:03:59,373
I'm not going to get carted off as a
slave, am I?

67
00:03:59,463 --> 00:04:00,769
Why did you "learn"?

68
00:04:00,881 --> 00:04:02,682
I'm not exactly
white, in case you haven't noticed?

69
00:04:02,828 --> 00:04:05,349
I'm not even human, Walk about like
you own the place, works for me.

70
00:04:05,552 --> 00:04:07,932
Besides, you'd be surprised...

71
00:04:08,023 --> 00:04:09,373
Elizabethan England,

72
00:04:09,621 --> 00:04:11,355
it's not
so different from your time.

73
00:04:11,827 --> 00:04:12,938
Look over there. . .

74
00:04:13,681 --> 00:04:14,942
They've got recycling.

75
00:04:18,387 --> 00:04:19,557
Water cooler moment.

76
00:04:20,098 --> 00:04:23,119
And the Earth
will be consumed by flame!

77
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,271
Global Warming!

78
00:04:24,361 --> 00:04:30,417
Oh yes, and entertainment,
popular entertainment for
the masses. If I'm right,

79
00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:34,386
we're just down the river,
by Southwark, right next to...

80
00:04:36,322 --> 00:04:37,920
Ah yes!

81
00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:40,262
..the Globe Theatre,

82
00:04:40,515 --> 00:04:41,799
brand new, just opened!

83
00:04:42,114 --> 00:04:45,716
Though strictly speaking, it's
not a globe, it's a tetradecagon, 14
sides,

84
00:04:45,851 --> 00:04:47,990
containing the man himself.

85
00:04:48,403 --> 00:04:49,979
Whoa, you don't mean...?

86
00:04:51,015 --> 00:04:52,185
Is Shakespeare in there!?

87
00:04:52,208 --> 00:04:53,086
Oh, yes.

88
00:04:53,446 --> 00:04:55,810
Miss Jones, will you accompany me
to the theatre?

89
00:04:55,878 --> 00:04:57,544
Mr Smith, I will!

90
00:04:57,859 --> 00:05:00,366
When you get home, you can tell
everyone you've seen Shakespeare!

91
00:05:00,636 --> 00:05:02,302
And then I could get sectioned!

92
00:05:24,089 --> 00:05:28,547
That's amazing! Just amazing! It's
worth putting up with the smell!

93
00:05:30,266 --> 00:05:32,427
And those are men
dressed up as women, yeah?

94
00:05:32,495 --> 00:05:34,138
London never changes.

95
00:05:35,692 --> 00:05:36,638
Where's Shakespeare?

96
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:37,921
I want
to see Shakespeare!

97
00:05:38,056 --> 00:05:39,925
Author, author!

98
00:05:40,267 --> 00:05:42,180
Do people shout that, do they
shout "author"?

99
00:05:42,248 --> 00:05:43,171
Author!

100
00:05:43,309 --> 00:05:44,120
Author!

101
00:05:44,165 --> 00:05:47,767
#Author, author, author. . .

102
00:05:50,687 --> 00:05:52,106
Well, they do know.

103
00:06:11,597 --> 00:06:13,398
He's a bit different
to his portraits!

104
00:06:33,675 --> 00:06:34,688
Genius!

105
00:06:34,891 --> 00:06:38,558
He's a genius,
THE genius, the most human human
there's ever been.

106
00:06:38,670 --> 00:06:40,382
And now we're gonna hear him speak!

107
00:06:40,562 --> 00:06:45,608
Always, he chooses the best words,
new, beautiful, brilliant words...

108
00:06:46,891 --> 00:06:49,286
Shut your big fat mouths!

109
00:06:52,775 --> 00:06:53,653
Oh, well!

110
00:06:53,834 --> 00:06:55,274
You should never meet
your heroes.

111
00:06:55,364 --> 00:06:56,963
You've got excellent taste,

112
00:06:57,076 --> 00:06:59,448
I'll give you that! Oh, that's a wig!

113
00:07:02,353 --> 00:07:04,671
Wind the craft of ancient harm,

114
00:07:05,212 --> 00:07:07,531
the time approaches for our charm.

115
00:07:07,733 --> 00:07:09,088
But I know what you're all saying,

116
00:07:09,358 --> 00:07:12,352
Love's Labours Lost, that's a funny
ending, isn't it?

117
00:07:12,532 --> 00:07:13,703
It just stops!

118
00:07:13,891 --> 00:07:15,557
Will the boys get the girls?

119
00:07:16,277 --> 00:07:18,866
Well,
don't get your hose in a tangle.
You'll find out soon!

120
00:07:19,002 --> 00:07:20,375
# When?

121
00:07:20,915 --> 00:07:21,928
When? When?

122
00:07:22,221 --> 00:07:23,752
All in good time,

123
00:07:23,873 --> 00:07:25,674
you don't rush a genius.

124
00:07:30,943 --> 00:07:31,708
When?

125
00:07:33,998 --> 00:07:35,146
Tomorrow night!

126
00:07:38,089 --> 00:07:40,903
The premiere of my brand new play!

127
00:07:40,993 --> 00:07:42,434
A sequel, no less!

128
00:07:42,727 --> 00:07:43,875
And I call it,

129
00:07:44,303 --> 00:07:45,975
Love's Labours Won!

130
00:07:53,696 --> 00:07:56,916
I'm not an expert but I've never
heard of Love's Labours Won.

131
00:07:57,028 --> 00:07:59,685
Exactly. The lost play.

132
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:01,126
It doesn't exist, only in rumours.

133
00:08:01,238 --> 00:08:03,715
It's mentioned in lists of his
plays, but it never, ever turns up.

134
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:05,600
And no-one knows why.

135
00:08:05,758 --> 00:08:08,099
?????

136
00:08:11,899 --> 00:08:12,732
No!

137
00:08:13,205 --> 00:08:14,331
That would be bad?

138
00:08:14,444 --> 00:08:15,601
Yeah, yeah

139
00:08:18,752 --> 00:08:19,923
well. . .

140
00:08:21,049 --> 00:08:23,361
I was just gonna give you
a quick little trip in the Tardis,

141
00:08:24,892 --> 00:08:27,324
but I suppose
we could stay a bit longer.

142
00:08:41,629 --> 00:08:42,709
Here you go, Will!

143
00:08:42,935 --> 00:08:44,038
Drink up!

144
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:47,235
There's enough beer in this
lodging house to sink the Spanish!

145
00:08:47,392 --> 00:08:49,171
Dolly Bailey, you've saved my life!

146
00:08:49,524 --> 00:08:51,100
I'll do more than that,
later tonight!

147
00:08:53,194 --> 00:08:54,950
And you girl, hurry up with the
tasks,

148
00:08:55,085 --> 00:08:56,999
the talk of gentlemen
is best not overheard!

149
00:08:57,224 --> 00:08:58,275
Yes, ma'am. Sorry, ma'am.

150
00:08:58,388 --> 00:09:03,836
Love's Labours Won? We're not ready!
It's supposed to be next week!
What made you say that?

151
00:09:04,039 --> 00:09:05,412
It's not finished!

152
00:09:05,615 --> 00:09:07,791
Just the final scene to go,
you'll get it by morning.

153
00:09:07,836 --> 00:09:10,785
Hello! Excuse me, not interrupting,
am I?

154
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,091
Mr Shakespeare, isn't it?

155
00:09:12,676 --> 00:09:14,545
Oh no. No, no, no, who let you in?

156
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:17,337
No autographs. You can't be sketched
with me.

157
00:09:17,449 --> 00:09:20,268
Don't ask where I get my
ideas. Thanks for the interest.

158
00:09:20,403 --> 00:09:21,776
Now be a good boy and shove...

159
00:09:24,422 --> 00:09:26,065
Hey nonny, nonny...

160
00:09:26,741 --> 00:09:30,726
Sit right down here next to
me. You two, get sewing on
them costumes, off you go.

161
00:09:31,536 --> 00:09:32,437
Come on, lads,

162
00:09:32,752 --> 00:09:34,891
I think our
William's found his new muse.

163
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:36,471
Sweet lady.

164
00:09:38,632 --> 00:09:41,289
Such unusual clothes, so...

165
00:09:41,582 --> 00:09:42,662
fitted.

166
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:43,928
Um...

167
00:09:44,085 --> 00:09:46,517
Verily, forsooth.
Egads.

168
00:09:46,652 --> 00:09:49,038
No, no, don't do that.

169
00:09:49,604 --> 00:09:50,167
Don't.

170
00:09:50,325 --> 00:09:54,220
I'm Sir Doctor of Tardis and this
is my companion, Miss Martha Jones.

171
00:09:54,449 --> 00:09:56,115
Interesting. That bit of paper,

172
00:09:56,476 --> 00:09:56,971
it's blank.

173
00:09:57,309 --> 00:09:58,232
Oh, that's...

174
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:01,119
very clever. That proves it.

175
00:10:01,299 --> 00:10:02,425
Absolute genius.

176
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:05,622
No, it says right there, Sir
Doctor, Martha Jones, it says so.

177
00:10:05,824 --> 00:10:06,905
And I say, it's blank.

178
00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:08,526
Psychic paper.

179
00:10:08,593 --> 00:10:11,913
Um...long story, oh I hate
starting from scratch. "Psychic"?

180
00:10:12,026 --> 00:10:12,589
"Psychic"?

181
00:10:12,679 --> 00:10:15,448
Never heard that before, and words
are my trade. who are you exactly?

182
00:10:15,628 --> 00:10:18,735
More to the point,
who's your delicious blackamoor lady?

183
00:10:18,825 --> 00:10:19,613
What did you say?

184
00:10:19,891 --> 00:10:22,165
Whoops. Isn't that a word
we use nowadays?

185
00:10:22,638 --> 00:10:25,609
An Ethiop girl, a swarth,
a Queen of Afric?

186
00:10:26,037 --> 00:10:27,106
- Can't believe. I'm hearing this.

187
00:10:27,241 --> 00:10:28,682
It's political correctness gone mad.

188
00:10:28,839 --> 00:10:30,978
Em, Martha's from a far-off land.

189
00:10:31,406 --> 00:10:32,216
Freedonia.

190
00:10:32,305 --> 00:10:33,205
Excuse me!

191
00:10:33,295 --> 00:10:34,489
Hold hard a moment!

192
00:10:34,849 --> 00:10:36,965
This is abominable behaviour,

193
00:10:37,168 --> 00:10:38,947
a new play, with no warning!

194
00:10:39,269 --> 00:10:41,431
I demand to see
a script, Mr Shakespeare.

195
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:43,637
As Master of the Revels,

196
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:47,757
every new script must be registered
at my office and examined by me,

197
00:10:47,847 --> 00:10:49,468
before it can be performed!

198
00:10:49,643 --> 00:10:51,354
Tomorrow
first thing, I'll send it round.

199
00:10:51,467 --> 00:10:53,988
I don't work to your schedule,
you work to mine!

200
00:10:54,123 --> 00:10:55,227
The script, now!

201
00:10:55,317 --> 00:10:56,307
I can't!

202
00:10:56,623 --> 00:10:58,806
Then tomorrow's
performance is cancelled.

203
00:10:59,205 --> 00:11:00,286
It's all go around here!

204
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:02,402
I am returning to my Office
for a banning order!

205
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:04,384
If it's the last thing I do -

206
00:11:04,969 --> 00:11:07,648
Love's
Labours Won will never be played!

207
00:11:11,859 --> 00:11:14,020
Sorry, sir, begging your pardon,
sir.

208
00:11:14,245 --> 00:11:16,519
Mind you don't hurt that
handsome head of yours, sir...

209
00:11:16,609 --> 00:11:18,162
Hold hard, wanton woman!

210
00:11:19,755 --> 00:11:21,241
I shall return later.

211
00:11:31,438 --> 00:11:32,271
Oh, my mothers!

212
00:11:32,721 --> 00:11:35,130
There's one seeks to stop
the performance tomorrow!

213
00:11:36,588 --> 00:11:38,096
But it must be tomorrow.

214
00:11:38,254 --> 00:11:40,640
Love's Labours Won must be performed!

215
00:11:40,865 --> 00:11:41,991
Fear not!

216
00:11:42,644 --> 00:11:44,017
Chant with me.

217
00:11:45,751 --> 00:11:48,483
Water damps the fiercest flame,

218
00:11:48,551 --> 00:11:51,545
drowns down girls and boys the same!

219
00:12:02,553 --> 00:12:03,341
Well then,

220
00:12:03,679 --> 00:12:04,489
mystery solved!

221
00:12:04,872 --> 00:12:06,511
That's Love's Labours Won
over and done with.

222
00:12:06,826 --> 00:12:08,808
Thought it might be something more,
you know,

223
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:10,293
more mysterious?

224
00:12:14,046 --> 00:12:14,857
Help me!

225
00:12:28,716 --> 00:12:29,774
It's that Lynley bloke.

226
00:12:29,796 --> 00:12:30,629
What's wrong with him?

227
00:12:31,597 --> 00:12:32,611
Leave it to me, I'm a doctor.

228
00:12:32,746 --> 00:12:34,502
So am I, near enough.

229
00:12:37,571 --> 00:12:41,489
Now to halt the vital part,
stab the flesh...

230
00:12:41,646 --> 00:12:42,885
And stop the heart!

231
00:12:46,933 --> 00:12:48,802
Eternal sleep is thine.

232
00:12:52,787 --> 00:12:57,059
Get the heart going,
Mr Lynley, come on, can you hear me?

233
00:12:58,387 --> 00:12:59,760
You're gonna be all right.

234
00:13:01,719 --> 00:13:02,687
What the hell is that?!

235
00:13:03,385 --> 00:13:06,740
I've never seen a death like it. His
lungs are full of water, he drowned.

236
00:13:08,423 --> 00:13:09,662
I dunno, like a...

237
00:13:10,562 --> 00:13:12,431
blow to the heart?
An invisible blow.

238
00:13:15,403 --> 00:13:18,755
Good mistress, this poor
fellow has died from a sudden
imbalance of the humours.

239
00:13:18,913 --> 00:13:20,466
A natural, if unfortunate demise.

240
00:13:20,624 --> 00:13:21,862
Call a constable, have him taken
away

241
00:13:21,997 --> 00:13:23,258
Yes, sir. I'll do it, ma'am.

242
00:13:27,828 --> 00:13:29,202
And why are you telling them that?

243
00:13:29,365 --> 00:13:33,192
They're still in the Dark Ages.
If I tell them the truth
they'll think it was witchcraft.

244
00:13:33,643 --> 00:13:34,633
OK, what was it then?

245
00:13:35,984 --> 00:13:37,065
Witchcraft.

246
00:13:38,168 --> 00:13:40,105
The potion is prepared,

247
00:13:40,758 --> 00:13:42,694
now take it.

248
00:13:43,415 --> 00:13:46,943
Magic words for the
playwright's fevered mind.

249
00:13:47,483 --> 00:13:49,082
Shakespeare will release us!

250
00:13:49,239 --> 00:13:53,269
The mind of a genius
will unlock the Tide of Blood!

251
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:56,643
Upon this night, the work is done,

252
00:13:57,318 --> 00:13:59,772
a muse to pen Love's Labours Won!

253
00:14:12,437 --> 00:14:13,923
I've got you a room, Sir Doctor,

254
00:14:14,238 --> 00:14:15,994
you and Miss Jones are
just across the landing.

255
00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:18,178
Poor Lynley.

256
00:14:18,456 --> 00:14:19,852
So many strange events.

257
00:14:20,527 --> 00:14:24,084
Not least of all,
this land of Freedonia,
where a woman can be a doctor?

258
00:14:24,197 --> 00:14:25,660
Where a woman can do what she likes.

259
00:14:26,834 --> 00:14:29,919
And you, Sir Doctor. How can
a man so young have eyes so old?

260
00:14:30,909 --> 00:14:32,215
I do a lot of reading.

261
00:14:32,891 --> 00:14:35,210
A trite reply, yeah,
that's what I do.

262
00:14:36,947 --> 00:14:38,028
And you,

263
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,684
you look at him
like you're surprised he exists.

264
00:14:41,337 --> 00:14:43,453
He's as much of a puzzle
to you as he is to me.

265
00:14:44,984 --> 00:14:46,448
I think we should say goodnight.

266
00:14:50,658 --> 00:14:51,626
I must to work,

267
00:14:52,031 --> 00:14:53,449
I have a play to complete.

268
00:14:55,633 --> 00:14:57,772
But I'll get my answers
tomorrow, Doctor,

269
00:14:58,042 --> 00:15:01,397
and I'll discover more about you,
and why this constant performance
of yours.

270
00:15:02,552 --> 00:15:04,263
All the world's a stage.

271
00:15:04,871 --> 00:15:05,704
Hmm.

272
00:15:06,087 --> 00:15:06,965
I might use that.

273
00:15:08,046 --> 00:15:09,261
Good night, Doctor.

274
00:15:09,959 --> 00:15:11,475
Nighty night, Shakespeare.

275
00:15:20,316 --> 00:15:22,207
It's not exactly five star, is it?

276
00:15:22,635 --> 00:15:24,369
Oh, it'll do, I've seen worse.

277
00:15:24,729 --> 00:15:25,990
I haven't even got a toothbrush.

278
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:30,819
Oh, contains Venusian spearmint.

279
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:34,367
So, who's going where? I mean,
there's only one bed.

280
00:15:34,502 --> 00:15:35,290
We'll manage! Come on...

281
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:41,464
So, magic and stuff,

282
00:15:41,824 --> 00:15:44,121
that's a surprise.
It's all a bit Harry Potter.

283
00:15:48,916 --> 00:15:52,118
But is it real? I mean, witches,
Black magic and all that, it's real?

284
00:15:52,321 --> 00:15:53,627
Of course it isn't(!)

285
00:15:53,807 --> 00:15:54,914
How am I supposed to know?

286
00:15:55,049 --> 00:15:57,368
I've only just started
believing in time travel.
Give me a brake.

287
00:15:57,458 --> 00:15:59,101
It looks like witchcraft.
But it isn't,

288
00:16:00,047 --> 00:16:01,735
You gonna stand there all night?

289
00:16:08,431 --> 00:16:09,601
Budge up a bit then.

290
00:16:11,121 --> 00:16:13,282
Sorry. Not much room.

291
00:16:13,485 --> 00:16:15,016
Us two here. Same bed.

292
00:16:15,415 --> 00:16:16,609
Tongues will wag.

293
00:16:16,879 --> 00:16:19,783
There's psychic energy, but a
human couldn't channel it,

294
00:16:20,706 --> 00:16:24,038
not without a generator
the size of Taunton,
and we'd have spotted that. No.

295
00:16:27,763 --> 00:16:29,249
There's something I'm missing,
Martha.

296
00:16:31,491 --> 00:16:32,797
Something really close...

297
00:16:34,441 --> 00:16:36,557
staring me right in the face,
and I can't see it.

298
00:16:40,384 --> 00:16:41,330
Rose would know.

299
00:16:44,487 --> 00:16:47,572
That friend of mine, Rose,
right now, she'd say
exactly the right thing.

300
00:16:51,016 --> 00:16:52,930
Still, can't be helped,

301
00:16:53,093 --> 00:16:54,151
you're a novice. Never mind!

302
00:16:55,232 --> 00:16:56,493
I'll take you back home tomorrow.

303
00:16:57,393 --> 00:16:58,384
Great!

304
00:17:49,249 --> 00:17:50,712
Bind the mind. . .

305
00:17:51,297 --> 00:17:52,761
and take the man,

306
00:17:53,531 --> 00:17:55,354
speed the words

307
00:17:56,367 --> 00:17:58,304
to writer's hand!

308
00:18:40,001 --> 00:18:40,699
Will!

309
00:18:40,857 --> 00:18:43,828
I've finished cleaning, just
in time for your special treat...

310
00:18:44,234 --> 00:18:45,022
Oh aye,

311
00:18:46,147 --> 00:18:47,408
I'm not the first then!

312
00:18:49,111 --> 00:18:51,070
I'll take that, to aid my flight

313
00:18:51,362 --> 00:18:53,704
and you shall speak no more, this night.

314
00:19:01,056 --> 00:19:01,687
What...?

315
00:19:04,096 --> 00:19:04,951
What was that?

316
00:19:09,147 --> 00:19:10,161
Her heart gave out.

317
00:19:11,174 --> 00:19:12,705
She died of fright.

318
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:13,718
Doctor...

319
00:19:14,866 --> 00:19:15,654
What did you see?

320
00:19:16,307 --> 00:19:17,050
A witch.

321
00:19:23,811 --> 00:19:26,017
Oh, sweet Dolly Bailey.

322
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:30,047
She sat out three bouts of the plague
in this place. We all ran like rats.

323
00:19:30,566 --> 00:19:34,214
But what could have scared her so?
She had such enormous spirit.

324
00:19:34,326 --> 00:19:37,050
Rage, rage against
the dying of the light.

325
00:19:37,681 --> 00:19:38,762
I might use that.

326
00:19:39,032 --> 00:19:40,383
You can't, it's someone else's.

327
00:19:40,810 --> 00:19:43,017
But the thing is, Lynley drowned
on dry land,

328
00:19:43,219 --> 00:19:46,259
Dolly died of fright,
and they were both connected to you.

329
00:19:46,709 --> 00:19:47,587
You're accusing me?

330
00:19:47,663 --> 00:19:49,194
No, but I saw a witch -

331
00:19:49,442 --> 00:19:50,320
big as you like,

332
00:19:50,410 --> 00:19:53,111
flying, cackling away -
and you've written about witches.

333
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:54,225
I have? When was that?

334
00:19:54,315 --> 00:19:56,026
Not...quite yet.

335
00:19:56,297 --> 00:19:57,647
Peter Streete spoke of witches.

336
00:19:57,747 --> 00:19:58,603
Who's Peter Streete?

337
00:19:58,648 --> 00:19:59,211
Our builder.

338
00:19:59,346 --> 00:20:00,516
He sketched the plans to the Globe.

339
00:20:00,719 --> 00:20:01,552
The architect.

340
00:20:02,734 --> 00:20:05,931
Hold on, the architect! The Globe!
Come on!

341
00:20:07,845 --> 00:20:10,502
The columns there, right,
and 14 sides...

342
00:20:11,853 --> 00:20:14,555
I've always wondered but I've never
asked, Will, why 14 sides?

343
00:20:14,667 --> 00:20:16,716
It was the shape Peter Streete
thought best, that's all.

344
00:20:17,255 --> 00:20:19,394
He said it carried the sound well.
But 14?

345
00:20:20,430 --> 00:20:22,231
Why does that ring a bell?

346
00:20:22,388 --> 00:20:24,099
14? There's 14 lines in a sonnet.

347
00:20:24,369 --> 00:20:25,338
So there is.

348
00:20:25,810 --> 00:20:28,403
Good point! Words, and
shapes, following the same design.

349
00:20:28,741 --> 00:20:31,172
14 lines, 14 sides, 14 facets.

350
00:20:31,307 --> 00:20:32,005
Oh, my head!

351
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:34,445
Tetradecagon! Think!
Words, letters, numbers, lines...

352
00:20:34,558 --> 00:20:35,774
But this is just a theatre.

353
00:20:35,864 --> 00:20:37,575
Yes,
but a theatre's magic, isn't it?

354
00:20:38,205 --> 00:20:40,299
You should know!
Stand on this stage.

355
00:20:40,772 --> 00:20:43,319
Say the right words, with the right
emphasis, at the right time.

356
00:20:43,409 --> 00:20:45,391
Oh, you can make men weep.

357
00:20:46,291 --> 00:20:47,507
Or cry with joy.

358
00:20:48,254 --> 00:20:49,605
Change them...

359
00:20:51,027 --> 00:20:54,944
Yu can change people's minds,
just with words in this place!

360
00:20:57,294 --> 00:20:58,758
And if you exaggerate that...

361
00:20:58,848 --> 00:21:02,248
It's
like your police box. Small wooden
box, but with all that power inside.

362
00:21:02,405 --> 00:21:02,991
Oh!

363
00:21:04,274 --> 00:21:06,345
Oh, Martha Jones, I like you!

364
00:21:06,435 --> 00:21:08,089
Tell you what though,
Peter would know, can I talk to him?

365
00:21:08,269 --> 00:21:09,373
You won't get an answer.

366
00:21:09,890 --> 00:21:12,164
A month after finishing this place,
lost his mind.

367
00:21:12,232 --> 00:21:12,997
Why, what happened?

368
00:21:13,583 --> 00:21:16,375
He started raving about
witches, hearing voices, babbling.

369
00:21:16,533 --> 00:21:17,456
His mind was addled.

370
00:21:17,568 --> 00:21:18,109
Where is he now?

371
00:21:18,154 --> 00:21:18,649
Bedlam.

372
00:21:18,739 --> 00:21:19,324
What's Bedlam?

373
00:21:19,437 --> 00:21:21,215
Bethlem Hospital, the madhouse.

374
00:21:21,306 --> 00:21:22,859
We've gotta go there, right now,
come on!

375
00:21:23,003 --> 00:21:26,425
I'm coming with you! I want
to witness this at first hand.

376
00:21:26,492 --> 00:21:26,988
Ralph,

377
00:21:27,078 --> 00:21:28,429
the last scene, as promised,

378
00:21:28,631 --> 00:21:30,635
copy it, hand it round,
learn it, speak it.

379
00:21:30,725 --> 00:21:32,909
Back before curtain-up, and remember,
kid, project,

380
00:21:33,038 --> 00:21:36,010
eyes and teeth, you
never know the Queen might turn up!

381
00:21:37,001 --> 00:21:38,869
As if! She never does.

382
00:21:40,693 --> 00:21:44,672
So tell me of Freedonia - where women
can be doctors, writers, actors?

383
00:21:44,808 --> 00:21:46,181
This country's ruled by a woman.

384
00:21:46,293 --> 00:21:48,076
She's Royal, that's God's business.

385
00:21:48,189 --> 00:21:50,080
Though you are a Royal beauty.

386
00:21:50,148 --> 00:21:53,687
Whoa, Nelly. I know for a fact
you've got a wife in the country.

387
00:21:53,822 --> 00:21:55,218
But Martha, this is town.

388
00:21:55,353 --> 00:21:57,019
Come on! We can all have a good flirt later!

389
00:21:57,176 --> 00:21:58,283
Is that a promise, Doctor?

390
00:21:59,812 --> 00:22:03,706
Oh, 57 academics just
punched the air, now move!

391
00:22:07,037 --> 00:22:08,501
Love's Labours Won.

392
00:22:08,771 --> 00:22:11,112
I don't think
much of sequels, they're never
as good as the original.

393
00:22:11,113 --> 00:22:12,351
Have you seen this bit?

394
00:22:12,576 --> 00:22:15,187
He must've been dozing off!
I don't even know what it means.

395
00:22:15,277 --> 00:22:16,898
That goes for most of his stuff.

396
00:22:16,989 --> 00:22:19,273
Ah, but at least it's my speech!

397
00:22:20,296 --> 00:22:21,827
I get centre stage!

398
00:22:23,523 --> 00:22:25,819
"The light of Shadmoch's hollow moon,

399
00:22:26,135 --> 00:22:28,296
doth shine on to a point in space,

400
00:22:28,476 --> 00:22:30,637
"betwixt Dravidian shores..."

401
00:22:34,168 --> 00:22:34,889
What was that?

402
00:22:35,969 --> 00:22:38,806
"..Dravidian shores and linear five,

403
00:22:38,896 --> 00:22:41,666
nine three o one six."

404
00:22:41,846 --> 00:22:44,473
A spirit stirs the ether!

405
00:22:45,351 --> 00:22:48,008
Too soon! Too soon!

406
00:22:48,729 --> 00:22:50,800
Naught to fear, my mothers,

407
00:22:51,303 --> 00:22:53,757
it is merely a rehearsal
of what's to come.

408
00:22:56,391 --> 00:23:00,019
"And strikes the fulsome grove
of Rexel Four..."

409
00:23:02,698 --> 00:23:03,877
By all the saints!

410
00:23:05,408 --> 00:23:06,511
It's a spirit!

411
00:23:08,672 --> 00:23:10,361
It's a vile shade.

412
00:23:17,132 --> 00:23:19,203
I think we should never
speak of this again,

413
00:23:20,307 --> 00:23:22,243
else we'll end up
in Bedlam ourselves.

414
00:23:28,928 --> 00:23:30,369
Please, please!

415
00:23:30,459 --> 00:23:33,003
Does my Lord Doctor wish some
entertainment while he waits?

416
00:23:33,701 --> 00:23:35,023
I can whip these mad men,

417
00:23:35,158 --> 00:23:36,802
they'll put on a good show for you.

418
00:23:36,892 --> 00:23:37,905
Bandog and Bedlam!

419
00:23:37,995 --> 00:23:38,828
No. I don't.

420
00:23:39,751 --> 00:23:41,935
Wait here, my lords while I...

421
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:43,916
make him decent for the lady.

422
00:23:45,087 --> 00:23:49,094
So, you call this a hospital?!
Where patients are whipped
to entertain the gentry.

423
00:23:49,274 --> 00:23:50,355
And you put your friend in here?

424
00:23:50,558 --> 00:23:52,944
Oh,
it's all so different in Freedonia.

425
00:23:53,238 --> 00:23:55,917
But you're clever! D'you honestly
think this place does any good?

426
00:23:56,210 --> 00:23:57,853
I've been mad, I've lost my mind.

427
00:23:58,056 --> 00:24:00,893
The fear of this place set me
right again, it serves its purpose.

428
00:24:00,983 --> 00:24:01,883
Mad in what way?

429
00:24:02,064 --> 00:24:03,077
You lost your son.

430
00:24:03,970 --> 00:24:04,825
My only boy.

431
00:24:04,938 --> 00:24:07,415
The Black Death took him.
I wasn't even there.

432
00:24:08,090 --> 00:24:09,171
I didn't know, I'm sorry.

433
00:24:09,238 --> 00:24:10,296
It made me question everything.

434
00:24:10,499 --> 00:24:13,673
The
futility of this fleeting existence.
To be or not to be...

435
00:24:14,784 --> 00:24:15,460
Ooh,

436
00:24:16,270 --> 00:24:17,283
that's quite good.

437
00:24:17,734 --> 00:24:18,837
You should write that down.

438
00:24:18,972 --> 00:24:21,291
Maybe not, bit pretentious.

439
00:24:22,011 --> 00:24:23,025
This way, my lord.

440
00:24:39,366 --> 00:24:40,469
They can be dangerous.

441
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:41,842
Don't know
their own strength.

442
00:24:41,955 --> 00:24:44,026
It helps if you
don't whip them. Now, get out.

443
00:24:49,036 --> 00:24:49,734
Peter...

444
00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:52,458
Peter Streete?

445
00:24:53,651 --> 00:24:55,092
He's the same as he was.

446
00:24:55,390 --> 00:24:56,560
You'll get nothing out of him.

447
00:24:59,510 --> 00:25:00,230
Peter?

448
00:25:06,422 --> 00:25:07,323
What is this?

449
00:25:07,728 --> 00:25:09,192
I must see.

450
00:25:15,766 --> 00:25:16,914
That stranger!

451
00:25:18,183 --> 00:25:20,120
He was at the inn with Shakespeare.

452
00:25:20,682 --> 00:25:23,046
I thought
then, he smelt of something new.

453
00:25:23,159 --> 00:25:26,851
Now he visits the madhouse -
the architect!

454
00:25:34,844 --> 00:25:36,127
Peter, I'm the Doctor.

455
00:25:38,544 --> 00:25:39,580
Go into the past.

456
00:25:41,133 --> 00:25:42,034
One year ago.

457
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:44,083
Let your mind go back.

458
00:25:45,771 --> 00:25:47,978
Back, to when
everything was fine and shining.

459
00:25:49,899 --> 00:25:53,029
Everything that happened
in this year since,
happened to somebody else.

460
00:25:54,222 --> 00:25:55,303
It was just a story,

461
00:25:59,885 --> 00:26:00,695
Let go...

462
00:26:01,505 --> 00:26:02,136
That's it.

463
00:26:04,568 --> 00:26:05,626
Just let go...

464
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:11,860
Tell me the story, Peter.

465
00:26:13,527 --> 00:26:15,125
Tell me about the witches.

466
00:26:15,553 --> 00:26:16,904
Who is this Doctor?

467
00:26:17,085 --> 00:26:19,247
Why does he come now,
at our time of glory?

468
00:26:20,418 --> 00:26:21,656
Doomfinger!

469
00:26:21,836 --> 00:26:23,074
Transport yourself!

470
00:26:23,628 --> 00:26:24,866
Doom the Doctor,

471
00:26:25,879 --> 00:26:27,320
doom his hide!

472
00:26:27,646 --> 00:26:29,785
Hide...

473
00:26:30,663 --> 00:26:31,778
The witches...

474
00:26:32,194 --> 00:26:33,506
spoke to Peter.

475
00:26:34,605 --> 00:26:36,564
In the night, they whispered.

476
00:26:36,699 --> 00:26:37,464
Whispered...

477
00:26:42,771 --> 00:26:46,261
Got Peter to build the Globe
to their design. THEIR design.

478
00:26:47,522 --> 00:26:48,873
The 14 walls.

479
00:26:49,736 --> 00:26:51,447
Always 14.

480
00:26:52,775 --> 00:26:53,833
When the work was done...

481
00:26:57,256 --> 00:27:00,295
..they snapped poor Peter's wits...

482
00:27:00,592 --> 00:27:03,384
But where did Peter see the witches?
Where in the city?

483
00:27:05,087 --> 00:27:06,303
Peter, tell me.

484
00:27:06,731 --> 00:27:08,667
You've got to tell me,
where were they?

485
00:27:11,729 --> 00:27:13,372
Allhallows Street...

486
00:27:13,482 --> 00:27:14,923
Too many words...

487
00:27:14,946 --> 00:27:15,846
What the hell?

488
00:27:15,981 --> 00:27:19,516
Just one touch of the heart.

489
00:27:20,447 --> 00:27:21,572
Noooo!

490
00:27:25,422 --> 00:27:27,629
A witch, I'm seeing a witch!

491
00:27:27,944 --> 00:27:30,131
Who would be next, mmm?

492
00:27:30,289 --> 00:27:33,261
Just one touch...

493
00:27:36,679 --> 00:27:39,673
I'll stop your frantic hearts.

494
00:27:39,831 --> 00:27:42,082
Poor fragile mortals.

495
00:27:42,217 --> 00:27:44,334
Let us out! Let us out!

496
00:27:44,491 --> 00:27:46,331
That's not gonna work,
the whole building's shouting that!

497
00:27:46,421 --> 00:27:49,125
Who would die first? Mmm?

498
00:27:49,237 --> 00:27:51,309
Well, if you're looking
for volunteers.

499
00:27:51,444 --> 00:27:52,007
No don't!

500
00:27:52,052 --> 00:27:53,650
Doctor, can you stop her?

501
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:55,654
No mortal has power over me.

502
00:27:55,767 --> 00:27:57,658
Oh,
but there's a power in words.

503
00:27:58,040 --> 00:28:00,234
If I can find the right one,
if I could just know you...

504
00:28:00,437 --> 00:28:02,441
None on Earth has knowledge of us.

505
00:28:02,576 --> 00:28:07,374
Now, think. Humanoid, female, uses
shapes and words to channel energy.

506
00:28:07,532 --> 00:28:09,203
Ah! 14!

507
00:28:09,316 --> 00:28:11,101
That's it! 14!

508
00:28:11,214 --> 00:28:14,152
The 14 stars of
the Rexel Planetary Configuration!

509
00:28:14,242 --> 00:28:16,263
Creature, I name you...

510
00:28:16,557 --> 00:28:17,822
Carrionite!

511
00:28:24,466 --> 00:28:25,483
What did you do?

512
00:28:25,619 --> 00:28:26,251
I named her.

513
00:28:26,553 --> 00:28:27,683
The power of a name.

514
00:28:27,864 --> 00:28:29,378
That's old magic.

515
00:28:29,830 --> 00:28:31,366
But there's no such thing as magic!

516
00:28:32,157 --> 00:28:33,242
It's a different sort of science.

517
00:28:33,287 --> 00:28:34,191
You chose mathematics.

518
00:28:34,304 --> 00:28:36,387
The right numbers, the right
equation, can split the atom.

519
00:28:36,861 --> 00:28:38,624
Carrionites use words.

520
00:28:39,008 --> 00:28:39,799
Use them for what?

521
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:42,649
The end of the world.

522
00:28:50,333 --> 00:28:52,455
He knows us!

523
00:28:52,545 --> 00:28:54,150
He spoke our name!

524
00:28:55,551 --> 00:28:56,997
Then he will know death!

525
00:28:57,562 --> 00:28:59,415
He will perish at my hand!

526
00:29:00,293 --> 00:29:02,870
My mothers, the time approaches,

527
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:05,853
you must away to the Globe, go!
I will join you,

528
00:29:05,988 --> 00:29:09,017
as soon as
this Doctor screams his last!

529
00:29:10,395 --> 00:29:13,460
The Carrionites disappeared way
back at the dawn of the universe.

530
00:29:13,550 --> 00:29:15,336
No-one was sure whether they were real or legend.

531
00:29:15,337 --> 00:29:16,398
I'm going for real.

532
00:29:16,533 --> 00:29:17,596
But, what do they want?

533
00:29:17,731 --> 00:29:19,630
A new empire on Earth.

534
00:29:21,261 --> 00:29:24,040
A world of bones and blood
and witchcraft.

535
00:29:24,334 --> 00:29:25,216
But how?

536
00:29:25,984 --> 00:29:27,543
I'm looking
at the man with the words.

537
00:29:28,899 --> 00:29:29,600
Me?

538
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:31,023
But I've done nothing.

539
00:29:31,475 --> 00:29:34,628
Hold on, what were you doing
last night, when that Carrionite
was in the room?

540
00:29:34,809 --> 00:29:36,232
Finishing the play.

541
00:29:37,209 --> 00:29:38,746
What happens on the last page?

542
00:29:39,627 --> 00:29:43,537
The boys get the girls, they have
a bit of a dance, it's all as funny
and thought-provoking as usual.

543
00:29:45,119 --> 00:29:46,678
Except those last few line.

544
00:29:47,903 --> 00:29:49,010
Funny thing is,

545
00:29:49,824 --> 00:29:51,247
I don't actually
remember writing them.

546
00:29:51,798 --> 00:29:52,792
That's it!

547
00:29:53,967 --> 00:29:55,097
They used you!

548
00:29:56,250 --> 00:30:00,092
They gave you the final words,
like a spell, like a code!
Love's Labour's Won, it's a weapon!

549
00:30:00,521 --> 00:30:04,869
The right words, spoken in the right
place, with the shape of the Globe
as an energy-converter!

550
00:30:05,027 --> 00:30:06,157
The play's the thing!

551
00:30:06,586 --> 00:30:08,100
And yes, you can have that!

552
00:30:17,328 --> 00:30:19,113
We left the lovers of Navarre

553
00:30:19,249 --> 00:30:20,989
by cruel chance sep'rated,

554
00:30:21,260 --> 00:30:25,586
none to claim his heart, their
labours lost, now will they find

555
00:30:25,812 --> 00:30:27,213
Love's Labours Won?

556
00:30:35,221 --> 00:30:36,577
Allhallows Street, there it is.

557
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:38,498
Martha, we'll track them down,
Will, get to the Globe.

558
00:30:38,611 --> 00:30:40,238
Whatever you do, stop that play!

559
00:30:40,396 --> 00:30:43,108
I'll do it! All these years I've
been the cleverest man around.

560
00:30:43,226 --> 00:30:44,627
Next to you, I know nothing!

561
00:30:44,717 --> 00:30:45,734
Oh, don't complain(!)

562
00:30:45,870 --> 00:30:47,135
I'm not, it's
marvellous!

563
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:48,070
Good luck, Doctor!

564
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:48,996
Good luck, Shakespeare!

565
00:30:49,132 --> 00:30:50,397
Once more
unto the breach!

566
00:30:50,510 --> 00:30:51,618
I like that...

567
00:30:52,092 --> 00:30:52,770
Wait a minute!

568
00:30:52,861 --> 00:30:53,991
That words are mine!

569
00:30:54,126 --> 00:30:55,460
Oh, just shift!

570
00:30:56,612 --> 00:30:59,119
The eye should have contentment
where it rests.

571
00:30:59,368 --> 00:31:02,080
This spun-out year I watch on...

572
00:31:02,419 --> 00:31:05,176
Patience, my sisters, patience...

573
00:31:05,348 --> 00:31:07,449
And mewling poor, drooped men
in stench'd...

574
00:31:07,495 --> 00:31:08,511
Stop the play!

575
00:31:09,099 --> 00:31:10,048
I'm sorry,

576
00:31:10,207 --> 00:31:12,014
adies and gentlemen,
but stop!

577
00:31:12,294 --> 00:31:14,825
This performance must end,
immediately.

578
00:31:14,916 --> 00:31:16,227
Oh, everyone's a critic.

579
00:31:16,317 --> 00:31:18,034
The wordsmith! Fear not!

580
00:31:18,351 --> 00:31:20,227
I have the doll!

581
00:31:20,475 --> 00:31:22,351
I'm sorry, you'll get a refund,

582
00:31:22,472 --> 00:31:25,477
but this play must not be performed.

583
00:31:28,754 --> 00:31:29,907
Is he drunk or what?

584
00:31:30,042 --> 00:31:31,443
Get him out of the way!

585
00:31:35,836 --> 00:31:38,909
You must forgive, our irksome Will,

586
00:31:39,090 --> 00:31:41,790
he's been on the beer
and feeling ill.

587
00:31:47,983 --> 00:31:49,994
There is naught can stop us now!

588
00:31:53,113 --> 00:31:54,356
Allhallows Street.

589
00:31:55,033 --> 00:31:56,254
But which house?

590
00:31:57,213 --> 00:31:59,405
Thing is though,
am I missing something here?

591
00:31:59,563 --> 00:32:03,156
The world didn't end in
1599, it just didn't.
Look at me, I'm living proof.

592
00:32:07,707 --> 00:32:09,786
Back to the Future! It's like Back
to the Future!

593
00:32:09,944 --> 00:32:10,667
The film?

594
00:32:11,130 --> 00:32:13,051
No, the novelisation, yes the film!

595
00:32:13,458 --> 00:32:15,062
Marty McFly goes back
and changes history...

596
00:32:15,198 --> 00:32:16,305
And he starts fading away!

597
00:32:16,909 --> 00:32:18,536
Oh, my God, am I gonna fade?

598
00:32:18,694 --> 00:32:20,773
You and the entire future of the
human race -

599
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:24,303
it ends, right now, in 1599, if we don't stop it.

600
00:32:25,297 --> 00:32:26,359
But which house?

601
00:32:33,281 --> 00:32:34,976
Make that "witch" house.

602
00:32:47,227 --> 00:32:48,741
I take it we're expected?

603
00:32:48,786 --> 00:32:52,131
Oh, I think death has been
waiting for you a very long time.

604
00:32:52,334 --> 00:32:53,125
Right then!

605
00:32:53,616 --> 00:32:54,452
It's my turn.

606
00:32:54,588 --> 00:32:56,328
I know how to do this.

607
00:32:56,667 --> 00:32:58,565
I name thee,

608
00:32:58,863 --> 00:32:59,767
Carrionite!

609
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:00,377
Argh! Huh...

610
00:33:01,937 --> 00:33:03,609
What was wrong? The finger?

611
00:33:03,730 --> 00:33:05,628
The power of a name works only once.

612
00:33:05,741 --> 00:33:06,803
Observe.

613
00:33:07,165 --> 00:33:11,527
I gaze upon this bag of bones,
and now I name thee Martha Jones!

614
00:33:12,091 --> 00:33:13,455
What have you done?

615
00:33:14,608 --> 00:33:15,986
Only sleeping, alas.

616
00:33:16,529 --> 00:33:17,614
It's curious,

617
00:33:18,178 --> 00:33:21,839
the name has less impact,
she's somehow out of her time.

618
00:33:22,450 --> 00:33:24,194
And as for you, Sir Doctor...

619
00:33:26,093 --> 00:33:27,313
Fascinating.

620
00:33:28,583 --> 00:33:29,894
There is no name.

621
00:33:30,481 --> 00:33:33,713
Why would a man hide his title
in such despair?

622
00:33:35,529 --> 00:33:37,472
Oh! But look!

623
00:33:38,082 --> 00:33:40,546
There's still one word
with a power that aches...

624
00:33:40,726 --> 00:33:42,195
The naming won't work on me.

625
00:33:42,263 --> 00:33:44,102
But your heart grows cold,

626
00:33:44,396 --> 00:33:47,922
the north wind blows and carries down, the distant...

627
00:33:48,803 --> 00:33:50,046
Rose.

628
00:33:50,973 --> 00:33:52,532
Oh, big mistake

629
00:33:52,713 --> 00:33:54,723
cos that name keeps me fighting.

630
00:33:55,490 --> 00:33:57,705
The Carrionites vanished,
where did you go?

631
00:33:57,976 --> 00:34:01,660
The Eternals found the right word
to banish us into Deep Darkness.

632
00:34:01,705 --> 00:34:02,767
Then how did you escape?

633
00:34:02,835 --> 00:34:05,768
New words, new and glittering.

634
00:34:06,152 --> 00:34:07,779
From a mind like no other.

635
00:34:07,870 --> 00:34:09,293
Shakespeare?

636
00:34:11,463 --> 00:34:12,954
His son perished!

637
00:34:13,807 --> 00:34:15,434
The grief of a genius -

638
00:34:16,293 --> 00:34:17,807
grief without measure,

639
00:34:18,485 --> 00:34:20,564
madness enough to allow us entrance.

640
00:34:20,858 --> 00:34:21,694
How many of you?

641
00:34:21,716 --> 00:34:22,530
Just the three.

642
00:34:23,795 --> 00:34:26,029
But the play tonight
shall restore the rest.

643
00:34:26,165 --> 00:34:29,536
Then the human race will be purged,
as pestilence.

644
00:34:30,169 --> 00:34:32,610
And from this world,
we will lead the universe back. . .

645
00:34:32,949 --> 00:34:35,529
into
the old ways of blood and magic.

646
00:34:36,253 --> 00:34:38,038
Mmm, busy schedule.

647
00:34:38,128 --> 00:34:39,786
But. . . first. . .

648
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:41,729
you've got to get past me.

649
00:34:42,633 --> 00:34:44,351
Oh, that should be a pleasure...

650
00:34:45,164 --> 00:34:47,131
considering my enemy
has such a . . .

651
00:34:47,921 --> 00:34:49,503
handsome shape.

652
00:34:50,055 --> 00:34:53,377
Now that's one form of magic that's
definitely not going to work on me.

653
00:34:54,168 --> 00:34:55,185
Oh, we'll see.

654
00:34:56,902 --> 00:34:58,032
What was that for, what did you do?

655
00:34:58,213 --> 00:34:59,254
A souvenir.

656
00:34:59,820 --> 00:35:00,731
Well, give it back!

657
00:35:05,330 --> 00:35:06,871
Well, that's just cheating.

658
00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:08,459
Behold, Doctor.

659
00:35:08,692 --> 00:35:11,120
Men, to Carrionites, are nothing

660
00:35:11,214 --> 00:35:12,965
but puppets.

661
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:18,772
Now, you might call that magic, I'd
call that a DNA Replication Module.

662
00:35:18,865 --> 00:35:20,429
What use is your science now?

663
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:28,294
Oh, my God, Doctor!

664
00:35:29,018 --> 00:35:30,886
Don't worry, I've got you.

665
00:35:34,019 --> 00:35:35,443
Hold on, mister.

666
00:35:36,026 --> 00:35:37,077
Two hearts?!

667
00:35:37,567 --> 00:35:39,178
You're making a habit of this.

668
00:35:39,879 --> 00:35:40,999
Ow!

669
00:35:42,013 --> 00:35:43,554
I've only got one heart working,

670
00:35:45,095 --> 00:35:46,379
how do you people cope?

671
00:35:47,173 --> 00:35:49,951
I gotta get the other one started,
hit me! Hit me on the chest. Argh!

672
00:35:50,068 --> 00:35:52,368
Argh!
Other side!

673
00:35:52,508 --> 00:35:56,452
Argh!
On the back, on the back.
Damned it!

674
00:35:56,453 --> 00:35:58,695
Left a bit. Argh!

675
00:35:58,741 --> 00:36:01,759
Lovely. There we go! Ba-da-boom!

676
00:36:01,899 --> 00:36:05,051
Well what are you standing
there for? Come on, the Globe!

677
00:36:08,596 --> 00:36:09,530
The Doctor?

678
00:36:10,324 --> 00:36:10,861
Dead.

679
00:36:10,954 --> 00:36:12,728
The ladies have prepared a show.

680
00:36:12,868 --> 00:36:16,511
Maria means to present
Isis descending
from the dewy orb of Heav'n.

681
00:36:17,304 --> 00:36:19,172
Ah, here comes Costard.

682
00:36:23,378 --> 00:36:24,265
Masters!

683
00:36:27,510 --> 00:36:28,636
We're going the wrong way!

684
00:36:28,707 --> 00:36:29,547
No, we're not!

685
00:36:31,368 --> 00:36:32,815
We're going the wrong way!

686
00:36:35,673 --> 00:36:38,124
Behold the swinish sight
of woman's love!

687
00:36:38,521 --> 00:36:41,323
Pish, it's out of season
to be heavy disposed.

688
00:36:41,416 --> 00:36:42,817
It is now, my mothers!

689
00:36:43,004 --> 00:36:45,838
The final words,
to activate the tetradecagon!

690
00:36:45,931 --> 00:36:52,707
Betwixt Dravidian shores and linear
five, nine, three, o, one, six,
seven, point, o, two

691
00:36:52,894 --> 00:36:55,958
and strikes the fulsome grove
of Rexel Four.

692
00:36:56,215 --> 00:36:58,456
Co-radiating crystal activate!

693
00:36:58,713 --> 00:37:01,030
The portal opens!

694
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:02,034
It begins!

695
00:37:07,043 --> 00:37:10,311
I told thee so! I told thee!

696
00:37:13,113 --> 00:37:14,163
Stage door!

697
00:37:33,334 --> 00:37:34,314
Stop the play!

698
00:37:34,408 --> 00:37:36,532
I think that was
it. Yes, I said, "Stop the play!"

699
00:37:36,555 --> 00:37:37,396
I hit my head.

700
00:37:37,468 --> 00:37:38,706
Yeah, don't rub it,
you'll go bald.

701
00:37:39,219 --> 00:37:40,550
I think that's my cue.

702
00:37:42,714 --> 00:37:47,010
Now begins the Millennium of Blood!

703
00:37:51,386 --> 00:37:53,393
The Doctor, he lives!

704
00:37:53,977 --> 00:37:56,358
Then watch this world
become a blasted heath!

705
00:37:57,035 --> 00:37:58,226
They come!

706
00:37:58,411 --> 00:37:59,625
They come!

707
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:32,957
Come on, Will!

708
00:38:33,074 --> 00:38:34,078
History needs you!

709
00:38:34,125 --> 00:38:35,105
But what can I do?

710
00:38:35,176 --> 00:38:36,016
Reverse it!

711
00:38:36,086 --> 00:38:37,300
How am I supposed to do that?

712
00:38:37,347 --> 00:38:39,950
The shape of the Globe gives words
power, you're the wordsmith -

713
00:38:40,186 --> 00:38:42,707
the one, true genius, the only
man clever enough to do it.

714
00:38:42,801 --> 00:38:44,528
What words? I have none.

715
00:38:44,715 --> 00:38:46,186
You're William Shakespeare!

716
00:38:46,349 --> 00:38:49,996
But these Carrionite phrases, they
need such precision.

717
00:38:50,136 --> 00:38:51,257
Trust yourself.

718
00:38:51,327 --> 00:38:54,058
With you the words just come
like magic!

719
00:38:54,151 --> 00:38:57,665
The right sound, the right shape,
the right rhythm,
words that last forever.

720
00:38:57,782 --> 00:39:01,003
That's what you do, Will, you choose
perfect words,

721
00:39:01,097 --> 00:39:03,081
do it! Improvise!

722
00:39:09,601 --> 00:39:12,403
Close up this din
of hateful dire decay!

723
00:39:12,776 --> 00:39:15,228
Decomposition of your witches' plot.

724
00:39:15,344 --> 00:39:17,883
You thieve my brains,
consider me your toy

725
00:39:18,023 --> 00:39:20,521
my doting Doctor tells me I am not!

726
00:39:20,637 --> 00:39:23,042
No! Words of power!

727
00:39:23,159 --> 00:39:25,680
Foul Carrionite spectres. . .

728
00:39:25,820 --> 00:39:28,885
cease your show between the points...

729
00:39:30,076 --> 00:39:31,617
Seven, six, one, three, nine, o...

730
00:39:31,833 --> 00:39:34,261
Sev'n, six, one, three, nine, o..

731
00:39:34,378 --> 00:39:36,773
And banished like a tinker's cuss,

732
00:39:36,913 --> 00:39:37,801
I say to thee...

733
00:39:40,625 --> 00:39:41,443
God!

734
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:43,917
Expelliamus!

735
00:39:43,990 --> 00:39:44,737
Expelliamus!

736
00:39:44,830 --> 00:39:45,670
Expelliamus!

737
00:39:45,741 --> 00:39:47,749
Good old JK!

738
00:39:51,387 --> 00:39:52,788
The Deep Darkness...

739
00:39:53,021 --> 00:39:55,169
They are consumed!

740
00:39:55,309 --> 00:39:57,901
No...!

741
00:40:11,001 --> 00:40:12,239
Love's Labours Won!

742
00:40:12,869 --> 00:40:14,060
There it goes!

743
00:40:46,252 --> 00:40:47,886
They think it was all
special effects.

744
00:40:48,259 --> 00:40:50,454
Your effect is special indeed.

745
00:40:50,571 --> 00:40:51,645
That's not your best line.

746
00:41:23,140 --> 00:41:24,237
And I say,

747
00:41:24,494 --> 00:41:27,599
a heart for a hart,
a dear for a deer.

748
00:41:27,807 --> 00:41:28,975
I don't get it.

749
00:41:29,161 --> 00:41:31,052
Then give me a joke from Freedonia.

750
00:41:31,548 --> 00:41:34,280
OK. Shakespeare walks into a pub

751
00:41:34,373 --> 00:41:37,047
and the landlord says,
"Oi, mate, you're barred."

752
00:41:38,659 --> 00:41:39,640
Oh, that's brilliant!

753
00:41:40,154 --> 00:41:42,582
Doesn't make sense, mind you,
but never mind that, come here

754
00:41:42,908 --> 00:41:44,262
I've only just met you.

755
00:41:44,403 --> 00:41:47,956
The Doctor might never kiss you.
Why not entertain a man who will?

756
00:41:49,917 --> 00:41:52,520
I don't know how to tell you
this, oh, great genius, but. . .

757
00:41:53,223 --> 00:41:54,857
your breath doesn't half stink.

758
00:41:55,044 --> 00:41:57,005
Good props store, back there.

759
00:41:57,775 --> 00:41:59,573
Not sure about this, though,

760
00:41:59,856 --> 00:42:01,607
reminds me of a Sycorax.

761
00:42:01,748 --> 00:42:03,755
Sycorax? Nice word.

762
00:42:03,942 --> 00:42:05,366
I'll have that off you as well.

763
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:08,670
I should be on 10%. How's your head?
Still aching. 'Ere...

764
00:42:09,279 --> 00:42:10,353
I got you this...

765
00:42:11,007 --> 00:42:12,058
Neck brace.

766
00:42:13,225 --> 00:42:15,023
Wear that for a few
days, till it's better. Although,

767
00:42:15,657 --> 00:42:16,661
you might want to keep it,

768
00:42:17,058 --> 00:42:17,711
suits you.

769
00:42:17,851 --> 00:42:18,809
What about the play?

770
00:42:19,509 --> 00:42:20,233
Gone.

771
00:42:20,350 --> 00:42:23,618
I looked all over,
every single copy of Love's
Labours Won, went up in the sky.

772
00:42:23,773 --> 00:42:25,127
My lost masterpiece.

773
00:42:25,337 --> 00:42:26,785
You could write it up again.

774
00:42:27,018 --> 00:42:28,466
Yeah, better not, Will.

775
00:42:28,979 --> 00:42:30,473
There's still power in those words,

776
00:42:31,127 --> 00:42:32,131
maybe it'd best stay forgotten.

777
00:42:32,201 --> 00:42:33,672
Oh, but I've got new ideas!

778
00:42:34,045 --> 00:42:36,266
Perhaps it's time I wrote
about fathers and sons.

779
00:42:36,546 --> 00:42:38,670
In memory of my boy.
My precious Hamnet.

780
00:42:38,834 --> 00:42:39,546
Hamnet?

781
00:42:39,639 --> 00:42:40,106
That's him.

782
00:42:40,620 --> 00:42:41,483
Ham...net?

783
00:42:41,670 --> 00:42:42,441
What's wrong with that?

784
00:42:42,534 --> 00:42:44,355
Anyway, time we were off.

785
00:42:44,612 --> 00:42:48,791
I've got a nice
attic in the Tardis, where this lot
can scream for all eternity.

786
00:42:49,247 --> 00:42:51,325
I've gotta take Martha back from Freedonia.

787
00:42:51,418 --> 00:42:53,473
You mean trouble of through time and space?

788
00:42:54,476 --> 00:42:55,013
You what?

789
00:42:55,130 --> 00:42:58,141
You're from another
world, like the Carrionites.
Martha's from the future.

790
00:42:58,404 --> 00:42:59,759
It's not that hard to work out.

791
00:42:59,922 --> 00:43:02,747
That's . . . incredible.
You are incredible!

792
00:43:02,887 --> 00:43:04,358
We're alike in many ways, Doctor.

793
00:43:05,616 --> 00:43:08,698
Martha, let me say goodbye
to you with a new verse.

794
00:43:09,164 --> 00:43:11,312
A sonnet for my Dark Lady.

795
00:43:14,114 --> 00:43:16,184
Shall I compare thee
to a summer's day?

796
00:43:16,465 --> 00:43:18,753
Thou art more lovely
and more temperate...

797
00:43:18,893 --> 00:43:19,640
Will!

798
00:43:20,340 --> 00:43:22,231
You'll never believe it!
She's here!

799
00:43:22,441 --> 00:43:23,772
She's turned up!

800
00:43:23,912 --> 00:43:25,656
We're the talk of the town.

801
00:43:25,843 --> 00:43:28,388
She heard about last night,
she wants us to perform it again!

802
00:43:28,504 --> 00:43:31,143
Who? Her Majesty, she's here.

803
00:43:34,586 --> 00:43:36,197
Queen Elizabeth the First!

804
00:43:36,570 --> 00:43:37,738
Doctor!

805
00:43:37,831 --> 00:43:38,368
What?

806
00:43:38,508 --> 00:43:40,469
My sworn enemy!

807
00:43:40,545 --> 00:43:40,895
What?

808
00:43:41,362 --> 00:43:42,926
Off with his head!

809
00:43:43,043 --> 00:43:43,650
What?!

810
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:44,724
Never mind what,

811
00:43:44,841 --> 00:43:45,243
run!

812
00:43:45,290 --> 00:43:46,107
See you, Will!

813
00:43:46,224 --> 00:43:46,948
And thanks!

814
00:43:47,321 --> 00:43:49,049
Stop that pernicious
Doctor!

815
00:43:53,546 --> 00:43:55,507
Stop in the name of the queen!

816
00:43:56,908 --> 00:43:58,215
What have you done to upset her?

817
00:43:58,332 --> 00:43:58,846
I don't know.

818
00:43:58,916 --> 00:44:00,900
I haven't met her yet!
That's time travel for you!

819
00:44:00,970 --> 00:44:02,371
Still, can't wait to find out...

820
00:44:02,931 --> 00:44:04,496
that's something to look forward to!

821
00:44:05,369 --> 00:44:06,513
Oh...

822
00:44:11,795 --> 00:44:13,662
We're
in the middle of New New York...

823
00:44:13,849 --> 00:44:15,320
He has arrived.

824
00:44:19,575 --> 00:44:21,070
You've got to let her go!

825
00:44:21,163 --> 00:44:23,194
Doctor! No!

826
00:44:23,848 --> 00:44:24,898
I need to talk to the police.

827
00:44:27,326 --> 00:44:28,143
You want happy?

828
00:44:28,237 --> 00:44:29,485
Bucket of anger.

829
00:44:29,509 --> 00:44:30,582
How much do you want forgetting?

830
00:44:30,746 --> 00:44:32,240
Well dressed for a hitch-hiker.

831
00:44:32,410 --> 00:44:34,745
They say people go missing
on the motorway.

832
00:44:34,862 --> 00:44:37,453
Some cars just vanish,
never to be seen again.

833
00:44:37,570 --> 00:44:40,167
Is there something living down there?

834
00:44:40,168 --> 00:44:41,661
What the hell are they?
