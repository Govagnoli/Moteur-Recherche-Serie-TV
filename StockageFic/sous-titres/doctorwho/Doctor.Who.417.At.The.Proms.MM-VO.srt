00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:22,895
Hello!

6
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:33,075
Hello and welcome
to the first ever Doctor Who prom,

7
00:02:33,175 --> 00:02:35,769
here in the wonderful
Royal Albert Hall.

8
00:02:36,078 --> 00:02:39,425
I'm Freema Agyeman and
I play Martha Jones in Doctor Who.

9
00:02:41,575 --> 00:02:42,850
Thank you!

10
00:02:44,666 --> 00:02:46,130
Now, I've been lucky enough

11
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:48,370
to actually travel in the TARDIS.

12
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:51,226
But today,
through the power of music,

13
00:02:51,497 --> 00:02:54,147
you get to experience
what that feels like too.

14
00:02:54,891 --> 00:02:58,015
This concert is a celebration
of the music of Doctor Who,

15
00:02:58,115 --> 00:02:59,870
composed by Murray Gold.

16
00:03:00,179 --> 00:03:03,348
Murray has written the music for
the last four seasons of Doctor Who

17
00:03:03,448 --> 00:03:07,338
and our Christmas specials.
And now we celebrate the monsters

18
00:03:07,438 --> 00:03:09,873
and the aliens that have kept
some of you out there

19
00:03:09,973 --> 00:03:12,181
hiding behind the sofa
on Saturday nights

20
00:03:12,358 --> 00:03:16,865
and have kept Martha Jones
running and running and running!

21
00:03:18,241 --> 00:03:21,270
Conductor Ben Foster
takes us on a journey to discover

22
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:23,194
all the strange, strange creatures.

23
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:45,339
Now, let's take a moment to rejoice

24
00:07:45,439 --> 00:07:48,130
in this wonderful Time Lord,
the Doctor.

25
00:07:48,611 --> 00:07:51,160
We're going to remember
how he first met Rose Tyler

26
00:07:51,673 --> 00:07:55,019
and then how Martha Jones travelled
the world keeping hope alive

27
00:07:55,284 --> 00:07:57,315
while the Master reigned supreme.

28
00:07:57,801 --> 00:08:00,168
To begin this sequence of music
from the series,

29
00:08:00,268 --> 00:08:02,040
please welcome back Ben Foster

30
00:08:02,257 --> 00:08:03,632
with The Doctor Forever.

31
00:19:23,354 --> 00:19:25,852
In that long sequence of music
from Doctor Who,

32
00:19:25,952 --> 00:19:30,509
we heard The Doctor Forever, Rose's
Theme and Martha Versus The Master.

33
00:19:30,609 --> 00:19:34,123
And I'm totally unbiased,
but the last bit was my favourite!

34
00:19:36,981 --> 00:19:37,880
But now,

35
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:40,433
we've got a special treat for you.

36
00:19:40,533 --> 00:19:45,010
This is truly exciting. We're going
to hear from the man himself.

37
00:19:45,601 --> 00:19:49,935
In a worldwide exclusive, never
seen before, especially for you,

38
00:19:50,238 --> 00:19:52,463
here's a brand-new mini-adventure

39
00:19:52,563 --> 00:19:55,403
starring that wanderer
from Gallifrey, the Doctor.

40
00:19:55,503 --> 00:19:58,784
Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls,
today at the Royal Albert Hall,

41
00:19:58,884 --> 00:20:02,243
here is the premiere
of Music Of The Spheres.

42
00:20:16,262 --> 00:20:17,723
Not now, I'm busy!

43
00:20:19,475 --> 00:20:20,742
And now, what?

44
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:22,175
ALERT
TELEPORT BREACH

45
00:20:22,423 --> 00:20:23,040
What?

46
00:20:23,558 --> 00:20:24,448
What?

47
00:20:27,572 --> 00:20:31,037
Oi! Get out of my TARDIS!
I let down the defenses for one second!

48
00:20:31,386 --> 00:20:32,482
I must speak to the Doctor!

49
00:20:32,730 --> 00:20:34,469
I don't care, you're a Graske,

50
00:20:34,569 --> 00:20:36,315
and a Graske is trouble.
Out!

51
00:20:37,490 --> 00:20:38,565
But that noise...

52
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:40,623
Beautiful sound in the air,
what is it?

53
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:48,197
If you must know,
it's the Music of the Spheres.

54
00:20:48,387 --> 00:20:50,375
Music of the Spheres is what?

55
00:20:50,475 --> 00:20:51,101
Well...

56
00:20:51,376 --> 00:20:53,849
You've got all these planets
revolving around suns,

57
00:20:54,035 --> 00:20:56,372
and all those suns revolving
around in a galaxy,

58
00:20:56,994 --> 00:20:59,310
and all those galaxies
revolving around each other.

59
00:21:00,087 --> 00:21:03,092
If you take the gravity patterns and
feed them to the TARDIS harmonic filter,

60
00:21:03,192 --> 00:21:03,925
that,

61
00:21:04,219 --> 00:21:05,260
Mr. Graske...

62
00:21:06,359 --> 00:21:08,198
is the sound of the Universe.

63
00:21:11,266 --> 00:21:13,163
The Universe sounds wonderful.

64
00:21:13,849 --> 00:21:14,770
Yeah...

65
00:21:15,731 --> 00:21:16,875
It does, doesn't it?

66
00:21:18,315 --> 00:21:21,110
- But you're still not staying!
- No, Graske came to warn you.

67
00:21:21,372 --> 00:21:21,932
About what?

68
00:21:22,032 --> 00:21:22,868
About that!

69
00:21:25,145 --> 00:21:26,991
Oh! Now...

70
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:29,769
That looks like a space portal.

71
00:21:29,989 --> 00:21:31,088
Told you!
Danger!

72
00:21:31,219 --> 00:21:32,790
Nah, it's harmless.

73
00:21:33,630 --> 00:21:34,912
It's just a hole in space.

74
00:21:36,598 --> 00:21:38,457
I wonder what's on the other side.

75
00:21:43,518 --> 00:21:44,238
Hello?

76
00:21:46,128 --> 00:21:47,229
Where is that, then?

77
00:21:49,415 --> 00:21:50,881
Who are all those people?

78
00:21:52,516 --> 00:21:53,439
Hold on!

79
00:21:55,357 --> 00:21:57,217
That looks like...
Is that the Albert Hall?

80
00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:00,734
I said 'is that the Albert Hall?'

81
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:02,759
"Yes!"

82
00:22:02,859 --> 00:22:05,729
I said 'is that the Albert Hall?'

83
00:22:05,895 --> 00:22:06,865
"Yes!"

84
00:22:06,965 --> 00:22:08,548
Oh! Brilliant!
Hello!

85
00:22:09,767 --> 00:22:11,045
I said 'hello!'

86
00:22:11,364 --> 00:22:12,688
"Hello!"

87
00:22:12,788 --> 00:22:17,520
No, no, no, sorry, you'll have to shout.
I said 'hello!'

88
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:19,629
"Hello!"

89
00:22:19,909 --> 00:22:23,616
Listen, I'm the Doctor, I'm a Time Lord,
but that is an awful lot of people!

90
00:22:24,368 --> 00:22:25,902
What are you all doing there?
Oh!

91
00:22:27,273 --> 00:22:31,028
Wait a minute, it's the Proms! Is that
the Proms? Are you in the Proms?

92
00:22:32,008 --> 00:22:34,805
Oh! I love the Proms!
I was in the very first Proms,

93
00:22:34,905 --> 00:22:37,043
1895, I played the tuba,
I was brilliant.

94
00:22:38,284 --> 00:22:39,639
Is that the orchestra down there?

95
00:22:39,911 --> 00:22:41,256
Oh! Wait a minute!

96
00:22:45,307 --> 00:22:49,888
'Cause, funny thing is, I've just been
composing something myself.

97
00:22:50,739 --> 00:22:53,780
I said to Beethoven I could rattle off
a tune, he said 'pardon'... But!

98
00:22:53,996 --> 00:22:57,454
I've just been inspired
by the Music of the Spheres.

99
00:22:58,239 --> 00:22:59,654
I've written my own symphony.

100
00:22:59,949 --> 00:23:00,583
Yeah.

101
00:23:00,898 --> 00:23:03,703
And if I can send these pages
through the portal

102
00:23:03,865 --> 00:23:06,136
then the orchestra can play it.

103
00:23:06,955 --> 00:23:08,276
A brand new piece of music.

104
00:23:09,019 --> 00:23:10,182
Composed by me.

105
00:23:11,061 --> 00:23:12,397
Ready for this, orchestra?

106
00:23:12,549 --> 00:23:13,373
Stand by!

107
00:23:13,716 --> 00:23:16,179
Three... Two... One...

108
00:23:19,772 --> 00:23:20,704
That's it, that's it.

109
00:23:22,919 --> 00:23:24,168
There you go, hurry up!

110
00:23:25,482 --> 00:23:27,973
This portal isn't gonna stay open
for long, right!

111
00:23:28,670 --> 00:23:29,231
Now!

112
00:23:29,331 --> 00:23:32,982
So! Er, if you don't mind,
Mr. conductor...

113
00:23:33,776 --> 00:23:34,624
Stand down.

114
00:23:35,811 --> 00:23:36,896
I'm in charge of this one.

115
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:41,822
Quiet please! Shhht!
Silence, settle down.

116
00:23:42,135 --> 00:23:43,409
Oi! Settle down.

117
00:23:44,038 --> 00:23:44,648
So!

118
00:23:45,513 --> 00:23:47,349
Ladies and Gentlemen...
and children,

119
00:23:47,684 --> 00:23:53,652
This is the world-wide premiere
of 'Ode to the Universe'.

120
00:23:54,979 --> 00:23:55,906
And...

121
00:24:08,393 --> 00:24:11,354
Oh, come on, that was brilliant!

122
00:24:12,584 --> 00:24:17,981
Thank you... I thank you... No, no,
I thank you, really, you're too kind.

123
00:24:18,523 --> 00:24:21,367
Ah! You see, Graske, that's the thing
about Planet Earth.

124
00:24:22,288 --> 00:24:22,910
What?

125
00:24:23,247 --> 00:24:25,468
What? Where's he gone?

126
00:24:27,161 --> 00:24:27,795
No!

127
00:24:29,586 --> 00:24:30,560
I've lost a Graske.

128
00:24:30,916 --> 00:24:33,345
He must have slipped through the portal.
Have you seen him?

129
00:24:34,225 --> 00:24:34,934
Oh!

130
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:36,430
There he is!

131
00:24:37,151 --> 00:24:39,423
Albert Hall, you've got
a Graske on the loose.

132
00:24:43,307 --> 00:24:45,087
And he's stolen my waterpistol!

133
00:24:46,491 --> 00:24:48,084
Oi! Graske!

134
00:24:48,314 --> 00:24:49,741
Stop it, behave!

135
00:24:50,489 --> 00:24:53,088
He wasn't trying to warn me, he was
trying to find a shortcut to Earth!

136
00:24:53,188 --> 00:24:55,498
If he escapes, he'll go around
the whole planet, causing troubles...

137
00:24:55,711 --> 00:24:56,851
stealing sweets...

138
00:24:57,532 --> 00:24:58,602
making smells...

139
00:24:58,993 --> 00:25:00,142
Hold on! Hold on! Hold on!

140
00:25:00,603 --> 00:25:02,853
I'm just gonna reverse
the polarity of the neutron flow

141
00:25:02,953 --> 00:25:05,438
and pull that Graske
back into the TARDIS!

142
00:25:07,028 --> 00:25:07,966
It's not fair!

143
00:25:08,626 --> 00:25:09,644
I'll give you not fair!

144
00:25:09,764 --> 00:25:11,628
I'm gonna reverse the teleport
and send you

145
00:25:11,728 --> 00:25:13,537
all the way to the other side
of the galaxy!

146
00:25:18,858 --> 00:25:19,497
Good!

147
00:25:21,056 --> 00:25:22,702
Well, that was fun.

148
00:25:23,432 --> 00:25:24,397
And a little bit mad!

149
00:25:24,497 --> 00:25:26,780
But I've got to close this portal
if I don't want anymore trouble.

150
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:27,989
It was nice to see you all.

151
00:25:28,390 --> 00:25:29,764
But, one more thing...

152
00:25:30,805 --> 00:25:31,734
Just remember...

153
00:25:32,507 --> 00:25:35,046
Music isn't just orchestras
and popstars

154
00:25:35,261 --> 00:25:37,933
and a bunch of people with albums
and downloads and concerts...

155
00:25:38,775 --> 00:25:39,777
It's you.

156
00:25:41,048 --> 00:25:44,157
'Cause the music of the Spheres
is all around you.

157
00:25:46,873 --> 00:25:47,967
When you're on your own,

158
00:25:48,269 --> 00:25:50,617
just close your eyes
and you'll hear it.

159
00:25:51,763 --> 00:25:52,621
Music.

160
00:25:52,919 --> 00:25:53,976
Inside your head.

161
00:25:55,075 --> 00:25:56,671
'Cause everyone's a musician.

162
00:25:57,107 --> 00:25:58,645
Everyone's got a song inside them.

163
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:01,408
Every single one of you.

164
00:26:03,018 --> 00:26:03,627
Bye.

165
00:26:11,931 --> 00:26:13,680
Attention! Attention!

166
00:26:13,963 --> 00:26:17,640
The Daleks have taken over
the Royal Albert Hall.

167
00:26:17,887 --> 00:26:19,921
This building is surrounded.

168
00:26:20,293 --> 00:26:22,925
There is no escape from the Daleks.

169
00:26:23,025 --> 00:26:25,316
Exterminate! Exterminate!

170
00:26:25,416 --> 00:26:27,277
Extermina-a-te!

171
00:26:27,377 --> 00:26:31,932
Move! Move,
or you will be exterminated.

172
00:26:35,472 --> 00:26:36,640
Move!

173
00:26:37,245 --> 00:26:39,886
Move to the platform and conduct.

174
00:26:40,170 --> 00:26:40,915
Move!

175
00:26:41,684 --> 00:26:42,757
Move!

176
00:26:43,249 --> 00:26:44,920
Behave yourself!

177
00:26:47,190 --> 00:26:51,764
We have travelled back in time
and captured Henry Wood.

178
00:26:53,827 --> 00:26:57,474
We will alter the history of the Proms.

179
00:26:57,878 --> 00:27:01,425
There will be only Dalek music.

180
00:27:03,135 --> 00:27:07,150
It is Davros,
creator of the Daleks.

181
00:27:11,189 --> 00:27:14,003
All hail Davros.

182
00:27:23,218 --> 00:27:25,754
All hail Davros.

183
00:27:27,962 --> 00:27:29,124
Welcome...

184
00:27:30,014 --> 00:27:32,480
to my Dalek empire.

185
00:27:35,767 --> 00:27:39,591
This Royal Albert Hall

186
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:44,009
will become my new palace.

187
00:27:47,397 --> 00:27:52,008
And you humans shall become...

188
00:27:52,443 --> 00:27:54,880
my obedient slaves.

189
00:27:59,244 --> 00:28:00,158
Dalek,

190
00:28:01,427 --> 00:28:05,269
has the conductor been conditioned
to obey your commands?

191
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:11,745
Yes, Davros.
He will obey or be exterminated.

192
00:28:13,581 --> 00:28:14,426
Excellent.

193
00:28:15,555 --> 00:28:19,441
Let the music of destruction commence.

194
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:21,020
Conductor...

195
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,823
begin!

196
00:35:21,230 --> 00:35:22,303
Hello!

197
00:35:25,653 --> 00:35:29,830
Hello. I'm Catherine Tate,
otherwise known as Donna Noble.

198
00:35:34,928 --> 00:35:39,820
And, er, I don't know about you,
but after Davros and the Daleks,

199
00:35:40,275 --> 00:35:43,315
the soaring voices
of London Philharmonic Choir

200
00:35:43,415 --> 00:35:45,467
and the cries of "Exterminate!",

201
00:35:45,978 --> 00:35:47,932
I'm ready to welcome back
some friends.

202
00:35:48,884 --> 00:35:52,254
Let's hear the music that accompanied
some of the Doctor's companions -

203
00:35:52,696 --> 00:35:55,813
the women who have laughed
with and loved the Doctor

204
00:35:55,913 --> 00:35:57,554
and left him broken-hearted.

205
00:35:58,532 --> 00:35:59,470
I know.

206
00:36:01,996 --> 00:36:06,530
Conducted by Ben Foster, here are
Murray Gold's beautiful themes,

207
00:36:06,896 --> 00:36:10,132
The Girl In The Fireplace
and Astrid Peth.

208
00:36:11,016 --> 00:36:12,921
Hello! Someone said hello.

209
00:36:14,845 --> 00:36:19,942
First, let's celebrate the super-temp
from Chiswick, Donna Noble...

210
00:36:25,191 --> 00:36:31,519
..and her adventures with the Doctor,
because poor Donna never can.

211
00:41:02,862 --> 00:41:06,138
In this next sequence, we're
going to be transported to a beach

212
00:41:06,238 --> 00:41:07,670
in a parallel world

213
00:41:07,770 --> 00:41:10,770
called Darlig Ulv Stranden,
otherwise known as...?

214
00:41:12,250 --> 00:41:14,288
Correct, Bad Wolf Bay.

215
00:41:14,484 --> 00:41:17,519
To perform Doomsday,
the BBC Philharmonic,

216
00:41:17,759 --> 00:41:21,330
the London Philharmonic Choir
and conductor Ben Foster

217
00:41:21,601 --> 00:41:24,611
are joined by composer
Murray Gold on keyboards

218
00:41:24,711 --> 00:41:26,949
with vocals by Melanie Pappenheim.

219
00:41:27,372 --> 00:41:29,977
Just before that,
we're off on a journey

220
00:41:30,236 --> 00:41:34,659
to the lost home of the Time Lords:
the planet of Gallifrey.

221
00:50:22,062 --> 00:50:24,927
Not a dry eye in the house,
I should imagine.

222
00:50:26,731 --> 00:50:27,892
Fantastic.

223
00:50:28,378 --> 00:50:32,290
Now, do you know, one of my
favourite days playing Martha Jones

224
00:50:32,390 --> 00:50:35,409
was Monday 25th February, 2008,

225
00:50:35,655 --> 00:50:39,321
which was when we filmed the scene
where the TARDIS flies Earth back home.

226
00:50:39,951 --> 00:50:43,039
At the controls there were
two Doctors, Martha, Donna,

227
00:50:43,139 --> 00:50:46,052
Rose, Captain Jack, Sarah Jane,
Mickey and Jackie,

228
00:50:46,152 --> 00:50:48,440
though Jackie wasn't allowed
to touch any buttons.

229
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:51,957
The Doctor, so often alone,

230
00:50:52,057 --> 00:50:55,980
really does have the best
ready-made family in the universe.

231
00:50:56,321 --> 00:51:00,680
To celebrate this wonderful family,
their courage and laughter,

232
00:51:01,008 --> 00:51:02,631
here is The Doctor's Theme,

233
00:51:02,731 --> 00:51:05,211
followed by Song Of Freedom.

234
00:59:02,120 --> 00:59:05,358
