Good morning, Adipose Industries.

Adipose Industries.

00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:30,130
The 21st century way to lose weight.

9
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:34,560
No exercise, no diet, no pain.

10
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:40,070
just lifelong freedom from fat, the Holy Grail of the modern age.

11
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:42,550
And here it is.

12
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,020
You just take one capsule.

13
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:48,110
One capsule, once a day, for three weeks.

14
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:50,890
And the fat, as they say...

15
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,910
'The fat just walks away.

16
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:56,710
' Excuse me, Miss Foster, if I could?

17
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:59,890
I am Penny Carter, Science Correspondent for the Observer.

18
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:04,640
There are a thousand diet pills in the market,
a thousand conmen stealing people's money.

19
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:07,900
How do we know the fat isn't going
straight into your bank account?

20
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:11,980
Oh, Penny.If cynicism burnt up calories,
we'd all be thin as rakes.

21
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:16,970
But if you want the science, I can oblige.

22
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:20,420
'Adipose Industries.

23
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:28,390
'The Adipose Capsule is composed of a synthesised mobilising lipase,
'bound to a large protein molecule.

24
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:35,280

100% legal, 100% effective.

28
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:47,420
But can Ijust ask, how many people
have taken the pills to date?

29
00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:55,080
We've already got one million customers
within the Greater London area alone.

30
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:59,160
But from next week, we start rolling out nationwide.

31
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:02,300
The future starts here.

32
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:07,410
And Britain will be thin.

33
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:10,330
Good morning, I represent Adipose Industries.

34
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:11,060
Good morning, I represent Adipose Industries.

35
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,790
Good morning, I represent Adipose Industries.

Good morning, I represent Adipose Industries.

37
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:22,930
That's a three-week course of pills for
the special price of ?l??

38
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:30,750
We deliver within three working days.

39
00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:35,310
The box comes with 21 days' worth of pills,
a full information pack,

40
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:39,760
and our special free gift, an Adipose Industries pendant.

41
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:43,420
It's made of 18-carat gold,
and it's yours for free.

42
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:46,390
No, we don't give away pens. Sorry.

43
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:49,040
No, I can't make an exception, no.

44
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:51,350
I'll need to keep this for testing.

45
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:53,670
And Ijust need a list of your customers.

46
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:54,530
Could you print it off?

47
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:55,640
I suppose so.

48
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:56,990
Where's the printer?

49
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:58,790
just over there, by the plant.

50
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:00,640
Which plant, that plant?

51
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:02,200
Yeah, that's the one.

52
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:03,190
Lovely.

53
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:04,190
That's the printer there?

54
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:04,990
- By the plant, yeah.
- Really?

55
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:08,180
Does it need a code?
Last place I worked, the printer needed a code.

56
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:09,300
No, I can do it from here.

57
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:10,960
Has it got paper?

58
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,380
Yeah, jimbo keeps it stocked.

59
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:14,110
Excuse me, everyone.

60
00:04:14,510 --> 00:04:16,050
If I could have your attention.

61
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:22,160
0n average, you're each selling 40 Adipose packs per day.

62
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:24,050
It's not enough.

63
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:27,660
I want 100 sales per person, per day.

64
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:30,870
And if not, you'll be replaced.

65
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:34,900
Cos if anyone's good at trimming the fat, it's me.

66
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:37,260
Now.

67
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:39,120
Back to it.

68
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:44,290
Anyway, If you could print that off, thanks.

69
00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:46,740
So if you could print off that list,
I'll get out of your way.

70
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:48,900
Lovely.

71
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:49,920
Thanks, then.

72
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:50,940
- See you!
- Thanks, then.

73
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:52,580
Ooh, what's that?

74
00:04:53,090 --> 00:04:53,990
My telephone number.

75
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:55,780
- What for?
- Health and Safety.

76
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:58,060
You be health.I'll be safety.

77
00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:03,770
But that contravenes paragraph 5, subsection C.

78
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:04,730
Sorry.

79
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:15,660
Me again!

80
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,240
Stacy Campbell?

81
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:20,270
Who wants to know?

82
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:26,200
My name's Donna, I represent Adipose Industries,
and you're on the list of our valued customers.

83
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:28,690
Mr Roger Davey!

84
00:05:28,890 --> 00:05:32,000
I'm calling on behalf of Adipose Industries,
just need to ask you a few questions.

85
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:32,930
It's been fantastic.

86
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:34,610
I started the pills on Thursday.

87
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:37,180
Five days later, I've lost 11 pounds.

88
00:05:38,210 --> 00:05:41,110
And no side effects or anything?

89
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,740
No, I feel fantastic.

90
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:43,790
It's a new lease of life.

91
00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:46,200
Now what do you think about these earrings, do they work?

92
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:47,860
Yeah, lovely.

93
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:52,010
I've been on the pills two weeks now,
I've lost 14 kilos.

94
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:53,780
The same amount every day?

95
00:05:54,210 --> 00:05:55,300
One kilo exactly.

96
00:05:55,670 --> 00:05:57,340
You wake up, and it's disappeared overnight.

97
00:05:58,110 --> 00:06:01,490
Well, technically speaking,
it's gone by ten past one in the morning.

98
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:03,440
What makes you say that?

99
00:06:04,290 --> 00:06:05,840
That's when I get woken up.

100
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:07,890
Might as well weigh myself at the same time!

101
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:09,740
Are you going on a date?

102
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,350
I'm doing the opposite, I'm dumping him!

103
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:13,520
I can do better than him now.

104
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,050
Right, I won't be long.

105
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:17,470
If the taxi beeps, give me a shout.

106
00:06:18,690 --> 00:06:19,810
It is driving me mad.

107
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:27,660
Ten minutes past one, every night, bang on the dot without fail,
the burglar alarm goes off.

108
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:31,940
I've had experts in, I've had it replaced,
I've even phoned Watchdog.

109
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:32,480
But no!

110
00:06:32,570 --> 00:06:35,030
Ten past one in the morning, off it goes.

111
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:36,680
- But with no burglars?
- Nothing!

112
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:37,770
I've given up looking.

113
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:40,870
Tell me, Roger.
Have you got a cat flap?

114
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,420
It was here when I bought the house.

115
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:44,830
I've never bothered with it.

116
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:46,680
I'm not a cat person.

117
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,550
No, I've met cat people.

118
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:50,280
You're nothing like them.

119
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:51,630
Is that what it is?

120
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:53,010
Cats getting inside the house?

121
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:59,110
Well, the thing about cat flaps is they don't just let things in,
they let things out as well.

122
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:01,520
Like what?

123
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,920
The fat just walks away.

124
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:08,080
Won't be long!

125
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,150
That's all right.

126
00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:49,860
We have unscheduled parthenogenesis.

127
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,210
Well, thanks for your help.

128
00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:55,060
Tell you what, maybe you could lay off
the pills for a week or so.

129
00:07:57,980 --> 00:07:58,690
Gotta go, sorry!

130
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:03,950
Send out the Collection Squad.

131
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:05,880
Bring them home.

132
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:21,930
You all right up there?

133
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:24,780
Yeah.

134
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:31,260
The Adipose has been witnessed.

135
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:35,460
'Activating full parthenogenesisl

136
00:08:58,930 --> 00:08:59,860
What are you?

137
00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:02,350
What are you?

138
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,020
I like what y0u've done with the hall.

139
00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:06,950
Stacy?

140
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:11,240
Are you all right?

141
00:09:14,570 --> 00:09:15,760
I wouldn't mind a little visit myself.

142
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:19,710
Everything all right in there?

143
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:25,960
It's only me.

144
00:09:27,090 --> 00:09:28,160
Do you mind if I pop to the loo?

145
00:09:29,990 --> 00:09:30,770
Stacy?

146
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:35,280
Help me!

147
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:36,810
0h, my God, help me!

148
00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:37,980
What is it? What's wrong?

149
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:41,580
Stacy!

150
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:29,400
Stacy Campbell?

151
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:31,600
- She's gone.
- Gone where?

152
00:11:32,990 --> 00:11:33,930
She'sjust gone.

153
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:36,420
Oh, great Thanks for nothing.

154
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,920
It seems we have a case of industrial espionage.

155
00:12:03,650 --> 00:12:06,720
One touch and the capsule bio-tunes itself to its owner,

156
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:10,790
but someone must have introduced a second, raw capsule.

157
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:14,990
Therefore, one of these people is a thief.

158
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:17,590
There!

159
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:20,890
0h, yes.There she is.

160
00:12:21,830 --> 00:12:22,590
Now...

161
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,120
What shall we do with her?

162
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,310
And what time's this?

163
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:41,340
How old am I?

164
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:44,350
Not old enough to use a phone.

165
00:12:46,830 --> 00:12:48,650
I thought you were only moving back for a couple of weeks.

166
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:49,830
Look at you!

167
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:52,880
You're never gonna find a flat, not while you're on the dole.

168
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:59,760
It's no good sitting there dressed up looking
like you're job-hunting, y0u've got to do something.

169
00:13:00,170 --> 00:13:01,830
It's not like the 1980s.

170
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:04,540
No-one's unemployed these days, except you.

171
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:07,610
How long did that job with Health and Safety last?

172
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:10,920
Two days, and then you walk out.

173
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:13,050
'I have other plans.

174
00:13:14,010 --> 00:13:15,040
' Well, I've not seen them.

175
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:20,860
And it's no good sitting there dreaming, no-one's gonna come along
with a magic wand and make your life all better.

176
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,030
Where's Grandad?

177
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:25,260
Where d'you think he is?

178
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:28,610
Up the hill!
He's always up the hill!

179
00:13:35,830 --> 00:13:36,700
Here comes trouble.

180
00:13:37,570 --> 00:13:39,160
Permission to board ship, sir.

181
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:40,200
Permission granted.

182
00:13:41,810 --> 00:13:42,490
Was she nagging you?

183
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:43,970
Big time.

184
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:45,860
Brought you a Thermos.

185
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:46,880
0h, ta.

186
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:48,750
You seen anything?

187
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:55,010
Yeah, I've got Venus, with an apparent magnitude of minus 3.5

188
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:57,170
At least, that's what it says in my little book.

189
00:13:57,980 --> 00:13:58,950
Here, come and see. come on

190
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:00,120
Here you go

191
00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:02,550
Right?

192
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:08,750
That's the only planet in the solar system named after a woman.

193
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:11,180
Good for her.

194
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:14,310
How far away is that?

195
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,810
It's about 26 million miles.

196
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:21,140
But we'll get there one day.

197
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:25,160
100 years' time, we'll be striding out amongst the stars,

198
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:29,000
jiggling about with all them aliens, just you wait.

199
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:33,180
You really believe in all that stuff, don't you?

200
00:14:34,650 --> 00:14:35,950
They're all over the place these days.

201
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:37,930
If I wait here long enough...

202
00:14:38,990 --> 00:14:40,530
Don't suppose you've seen a little blue box?

203
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,300
Is that slang for something?

204
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:46,450
No, I mean it.

205
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:53,060
If you ever see a little blue box flying up there in the sky,
you shout for me, Gramps.

206
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:55,550
0h, you just shout.

207
00:14:59,550 --> 00:15:02,030
D'you know, I don't understand half the things you say these days.

208
00:15:03,630 --> 00:15:05,800
- Nor me.
- No, fair dos.

209
00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:08,710
You've had a funny old time of it lately.

210
00:15:10,030 --> 00:15:12,640
There was poor old whats his name, Lance, bless him.

211
00:15:13,930 --> 00:15:15,250
That barmy old Christmas.

212
00:15:17,770 --> 00:15:19,480
I wish you'd tell us what really happened.

213
00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:21,380
I know.

214
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:23,100
It's just...

215
00:15:24,970 --> 00:15:25,840
The things I've seen.

216
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:28,040
Sometimes I think I'm going mad.

217
00:15:28,650 --> 00:15:30,130
I mean, even tonight, I was in a...

218
00:15:33,930 --> 00:15:34,540
Doesn't matter.

219
00:15:35,950 --> 00:15:37,440
Well, you're not yourself, I'll give you that.

220
00:15:39,090 --> 00:15:41,150
You just...You seem to be drifting, sweetheart.

221
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:42,930
I'm not drifting.

222
00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:46,180
I'm waiting.

223
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:49,740
- What for?
- The right man.

224
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:53,850
Same old story.

225
00:15:54,490 --> 00:15:55,420
A man!

226
00:15:56,110 --> 00:15:57,790
No, I don't mean like that.

227
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,210
But he's real.

228
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,870
I've seen him.I've met him.
just once.

229
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,920
And then I let him fly away.

230
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:09,480
Well, there you are.Go and find him.

231
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:10,930
I've tried.

232
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:13,730
He's nowhere.

233
00:16:15,310 --> 00:16:16,280
Not like you to give up.

234
00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:22,550
I remember when you was about six years old,
your mother said, 'No holiday this year.

235
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:27,170
' So off you toddled all on your own, and you got on a bus to Strathclyde!

236
00:16:28,390 --> 00:16:30,340
We had the police out and everything!

237
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:33,090
Where's she gone, then?

238
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:36,020
Where's that girl?

239
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:38,500
You're right.

240
00:16:40,830 --> 00:16:42,950
Cos he's still out there, somewhere.

241
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:45,920
And I'll find him, Gramps.

242
00:16:48,210 --> 00:16:49,650
Even if I have to wait 100 years...

243
00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:52,590
I'll find him.

244
00:16:57,890 --> 00:16:59,190
Oh, fascinating.

245
00:17:00,510 --> 00:17:02,840
Seems to be a bioflip digital stitch, specifically for...

246
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:26,650
It's my turn for the car.
What do you need it for?

247
00:17:28,010 --> 00:17:29,070
A quick get away.

248
00:18:10,550 --> 00:18:11,120
Morning!

249
00:18:34,850 --> 00:18:36,290
Keep an eye out.She'll come back.

250
00:18:37,770 --> 00:18:40,070
And then she's mine.

251
00:18:50,590 --> 00:18:51,850
See you???

252
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:17,960
I need the car.

253
00:19:18,130 --> 00:19:18,880
Where are you?

254
00:19:19,790 --> 00:19:21,130
I can't. I'm busy.

255
00:19:21,350 --> 00:19:22,260
Why are you whispering?

256
00:19:22,850 --> 00:19:23,850
I am in church.

257
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:26,130
What are you doing in church?

258
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:28,590
Praying

259
00:19:29,370 --> 00:19:30,210
Bit late for that, madam.

260
00:19:30,530 --> 00:19:32,020
What is she ?? for

261
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:33,510
Hush, you!Go up the hill.

262
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:36,960
But I need the car.

263
00:19:37,090 --> 00:19:38,040
I'm going out with Suzette.

264
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,040
She's asked all the Wednesday girls.

265
00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:53,650
We know you're in here, so why don't you make
this nice and easy and show yourself?

266
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,720
I'm waiting.

267
00:19:59,710 --> 00:20:01,410
I warn you, I'm not a patient woman.

268
00:20:01,410 --> 00:20:03,080
Now, out you come.

269
00:20:04,410 --> 00:20:08,550
Right, we'll do it the hard way.

270
00:20:09,370 --> 00:20:10,610
Get her!

271
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:23,060
There you are.

272
00:20:25,230 --> 00:20:29,090
I've been through the records, Foster,
and all of your results have been faked.

273
00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:31,490
There's something about those pills
you're not telling us.

274
00:20:31,490 --> 00:20:34,780
0h, I think I'll be conducting this interview, Penny.

275
00:21:00,610 --> 00:21:01,780
You've got no right to do this.

276
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:03,120
Let me go!

277
00:21:18,550 --> 00:21:20,510
This is ridiculous.

278
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:25,140
Sit there.

279
00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:26,650
I'm phoning my editor.

280
00:21:26,650 --> 00:21:27,850
I said sit.

281
00:21:30,010 --> 00:21:31,650
'You can't tie me up!

282
00:21:31,650 --> 00:21:33,420
' What sort of a country do you think this is?

283
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:36,440
Oh, it's a beautifully fat country.

284
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:39,950
I've travelled a long way to find obesity on this scale.

285
00:21:39,950 --> 00:21:41,960
So come on, then, Miss Foster.

286
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:45,310
Those pills, what are they?

287
00:21:45,310 --> 00:21:48,860
Well, you might as well have a scoop,
since you'll never see it printed.

288
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:55,100
This is the spark of life.

289
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,090
And what's that supposed to mean?

290
00:21:57,090 --> 00:22:01,710
Officially, the capsule attracts
all the fat cells and flushes them away.

291
00:22:01,710 --> 00:22:02,860
Well, it certainly attracts them.

292
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:04,910
That part's true.

293
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:08,830
But it binds the fat together
and galvanises it to form a body.

294
00:22:08,830 --> 00:22:11,170
Well, what do you mean 'a body'?

295
00:22:11,170 --> 00:22:13,480
I am surprised you never asked about my name.

296
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:15,230
I chose it well.

297
00:22:16,730 --> 00:22:20,810
Foster, as in foster mother.

298
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:24,210
And these...

299
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,560
are my children.

300
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:30,190
You're kidding me.

301
00:22:30,590 --> 00:22:32,450
What the hell is that?

302
00:22:32,450 --> 00:22:34,250
Adipose.

303
00:22:35,930 --> 00:22:40,670
It's called an Adipose.

304
00:22:40,670 --> 00:22:43,760
Made out of living fat.

305
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:58,920
Are we interrupting you?

306
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:02,840
Get her!

307
00:24:04,870 --> 00:24:06,350
And him!

308
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:34,160
What about me?

309
00:24:41,770 --> 00:24:45,910
Oh, my God, I don't believe it!

310
00:24:45,910 --> 00:24:47,690
You've even got the same suit.

311
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:50,110
Don't you ever change?

312
00:24:50,110 --> 00:24:52,360
Yeah, thanks Donna, not right now.

313
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:58,090
just like old times!

314
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:03,000
Cos I thought, 'How do you find the Doctor?

315
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,570
' Then I thought, 'Look for trouble, and he'll turn up.

316
00:25:05,570 --> 00:25:11,100
' I looked everywhere, you name it- UF0 sightings,
crop circles, sea monsters...

317
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:12,230
I found them all.

318
00:25:12,230 --> 00:25:15,510
Like the bees disappearing,
I thought, 'He's connected.

319
00:25:15,510 --> 00:25:18,710
' Cos the thing is, Doctor,
I believe it all now.

320
00:25:18,710 --> 00:25:20,150
You opened my eyes.

321
00:25:20,150 --> 00:25:22,960
All those amazing things out there,
I believe them all.

322
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:26,610
Apart from that replica of the Titanic flying over Buckingham Palace.

323
00:25:26,610 --> 00:25:27,910
That's a hoax.

324
00:25:27,910 --> 00:25:29,620
What do you mean, the bees are disappearing?

325
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:31,780
That's what it says on the internet.

326
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:36,080
There were conspiracy theories about Adipose Industries,
so I thought I'd look.

327
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:36,940
In you get!

328
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:38,030
What, in that thing?

329
00:25:38,030 --> 00:25:41,490
But they'll just call us back up again.

330
00:25:41,490 --> 00:25:43,130
I've locked the controls with a sonic cage.

331
00:25:43,130 --> 00:25:44,750
Only I can control it.

332
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:46,220
Not unless she's got a sonic device.

333
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:47,920
Which is very unlikely.

334
00:25:48,490 --> 00:25:50,100
Out of my way.

335
00:26:11,270 --> 00:26:13,390
0h, I don't think so.

336
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:35,220
Come on.

337
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:37,030
We can get in through the window.

338
00:26:37,030 --> 00:26:38,590
Deadlock the building.

339
00:26:38,590 --> 00:26:40,670
Can't get it open!

340
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,630
We'll smash it, then!

341
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:01,910
She's cutting the cable!

342
00:27:06,090 --> 00:27:07,590
Donna!

343
00:27:09,090 --> 00:27:10,520
Doctor!

344
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:12,270
Hold on!

345
00:27:12,270 --> 00:27:14,190
I am!

346
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:23,730
Doctor!

347
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:29,290
And now for the other one.

348
00:28:00,230 --> 00:28:02,060
I'm going to fall!

349
00:28:05,780 --> 00:28:07,810
What the hell is going on?

350
00:28:08,780 --> 00:28:10,640
This is all your fault.

351
00:28:11,290 --> 00:28:13,390
I should've stayed at home!

352
00:28:13,390 --> 00:28:15,120
I won't be a minute!

353
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:23,760
Yes, he's slippery, that one.

354
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:26,120
Time we found out who he is.

355
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,950
Is anyone gonna tell me what's going on?

356
00:28:40,950 --> 00:28:41,900
You ajournalist?

357
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:43,100
Yes.

358
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:44,580
Well, make it up.

359
00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:46,700
Get off!

360
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:47,630
I've got you.

361
00:28:47,630 --> 00:28:48,590
I've got you.

362
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:50,580
Stop kicking!

363
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:57,920
I was right.

364
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:59,410
It's always like this with you, innit?

365
00:28:59,410 --> 00:29:00,280
Oh, yes!

366
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:01,880
And off we go!

367
00:29:04,430 --> 00:29:05,680
Sorry!

368
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:10,150
Now do yourself a favour, get out.

369
00:29:15,270 --> 00:29:16,810
Well, then.

370
00:29:18,650 --> 00:29:20,500
At last.

371
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:21,220
Hello.

372
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:22,860
Nice to meet you. I'm the Doctor.

373
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:23,980
And I'm Donna.

374
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:25,520
Partners in crime.

375
00:29:26,110 --> 00:29:30,320
And evidently off-worlders, judging by your sonic technology.

376
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:31,520
0h, yes!

377
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,880
I've still got your sonic pen.

378
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:35,190
Nice! I like it.

379
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:36,990
Sleek, it's kind of sleek.

380
00:29:36,990 --> 00:29:38,280
Oh, it's definitely sleek.

381
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:41,980
And if you were to sign your real name,
that would be?

382
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:45,710
Matron Cofelia, of the Five-Straighten Classabindi Nursery Fleet.

383
00:29:45,710 --> 00:29:47,360
Intergalactic Class.

384
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:49,010
A wet nurse.

385
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:51,850
Using humans as surrogates.

386
00:29:51,850 --> 00:29:58,050
I've been employed by the Adiposian first family to foster
a new generation after their breeding planet was lost.

387
00:29:58,050 --> 00:30:00,190
How do you lose a planet?

388
00:30:00,190 --> 00:30:02,370
Oh, the politics are none of my concern.

389
00:30:02,370 --> 00:30:05,850
I'm just here to take care of the
children on behalf ofthe parents.

390
00:30:05,850 --> 00:30:08,040
What, like an outer space Supernanny?

391
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:09,760
Yes, if you like.

392
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:11,740
So.

393
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:15,520
So those little things,
they're made out of fat, yeah?

394
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:18,540
But that woman, Stacy Campbell,
there was nothing left of her.

395
00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:23,230
0h, in a crisis, the Adipose can convert
bone and hair and internal organs.

396
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:26,410
Makes them a little bit sick, poor things.

397
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:29,420
What about poor Stacy?

398
00:30:29,420 --> 00:30:33,240
Seeding a level five planet is against galactic law.

399
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:36,420
Are you threatening me?

400
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:39,110
I'm trying to help you, Matron.

401
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:41,770
This is your one chance.

402
00:30:41,770 --> 00:30:46,470
Cos if you don't call this off,
then I'll have to stop you.

403
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:49,230
I hardly think you can stop bullets.

404
00:30:49,230 --> 00:30:50,790
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

405
00:30:50,790 --> 00:30:52,930
One more thing - before dying.

406
00:30:52,930 --> 00:30:57,900
Do you know what happens if you hold two
identical sonic devices against each other?

407
00:30:59,250 --> 00:31:00,070
No.

408
00:31:00,070 --> 00:31:00,960
Nor me.

409
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:02,190
Let's find out.

410
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,400
Come on!

411
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:15,650
I'm advancing the birth plan.

412
00:31:15,650 --> 00:31:17,650
We're going into premature labour.

413
00:31:19,810 --> 00:31:21,860
Cellular bossification.

414
00:31:24,150 --> 00:31:25,620
Tie her up.

415
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:28,600
Oh, you're kidding me.

416
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:40,240
That's one solution.

417
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:41,500
Hide in a cupboard.

418
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:42,980
I like it!

419
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:44,200
I've been hacking into this all day,

420
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:48,570
cos the Matron's got a computer core running
through the building, triple-deadlocked.

421
00:31:48,570 --> 00:31:51,680
But now I've got this, I can get into it.

422
00:31:57,290 --> 00:31:58,970
What does that thing do?

423
00:31:59,330 --> 00:32:01,030
It's the inducer.

424
00:32:01,890 --> 00:32:04,010
We had planned to seed millions.

425
00:32:04,780 --> 00:32:08,080
But if that man's an alien and
he's alerted the Shadow Proclamation,

426
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:11,260
then the first one million humans will have to do.

427
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:13,720
Find him, and the woman.

428
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:15,880
Don't waste time, just kill them.

429
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:19,540
She's wired up the whole building.

430
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:23,190
And we need a bit of privacy.

431
00:32:26,770 --> 00:32:28,710
just enough to stun them.

432
00:32:28,710 --> 00:32:31,110
But why's she wired up a tower block?

433
00:32:31,110 --> 00:32:33,150
What's it all for?

434
00:32:40,790 --> 00:32:43,140
'Inducer online.

435
00:32:46,310 --> 00:32:47,810
' You look older.

436
00:32:47,810 --> 00:32:49,250
Thanks.

437
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:51,140
Still on your own?

438
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:52,390
Yep.

439
00:32:52,750 --> 00:32:53,930
Well, no.

440
00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:56,210
I had this friend. Martha, she was called

441
00:32:56,210 --> 00:32:58,300
Martha jones. She was brilliant.

442
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:01,700
And I destroyed half her life.

443
00:33:02,750 --> 00:33:04,550
But she's fine, she's good.

444
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:07,200
She's gone.

445
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:10,010
What about Rose?

446
00:33:11,010 --> 00:33:12,590
Still lost.

447
00:33:13,970 --> 00:33:16,380
I thought you were gonna travel the world.

448
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:18,860
Easier said than done.

449
00:33:19,610 --> 00:33:23,150
It's like, I had that one day
with you and I was gonna change.

450
00:33:23,150 --> 00:33:25,450
I was gonna do so much.

451
00:33:26,270 --> 00:33:30,680
And then I woke up the next morning, same old life.

452
00:33:31,660 --> 00:33:34,500
It's like you were never there.

453
00:33:35,350 --> 00:33:38,450
And I tried, I did try.

454
00:33:38,450 --> 00:33:39,630
I went to Egypt.

455
00:33:39,630 --> 00:33:41,820
I was gonna go barefoot and everything.

456
00:33:43,110 --> 00:33:45,810
Then it's all bus trips and guidebooks
and don't drink the water,

457
00:33:45,810 --> 00:33:48,340
and two weeks later, you're back at home.

458
00:33:50,190 --> 00:33:51,850
It's nothing like being with you.

459
00:33:53,310 --> 00:33:55,050
I must've been mad, turning down that offer.

460
00:33:55,050 --> 00:33:56,460
What offer?

461
00:33:57,230 --> 00:33:58,770
To come with you.

462
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:01,530
You're coming with me?

463
00:34:01,970 --> 00:34:03,680
0h, yes, please!

464
00:34:05,070 --> 00:34:06,570
Right.

465
00:34:06,570 --> 00:34:08,740
'Inducer activated.

466
00:34:08,740 --> 00:34:09,870
' What's it doing now?

467
00:34:09,870 --> 00:34:11,690
She started the program.

468
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:15,300
'Inducer transmitting.

469
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:18,030
' Mark the date, Miss Carter.

470
00:34:18,030 --> 00:34:19,950
Happy birthday.

471
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:25,520
One million birthdays.

472
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:31,620
I swear, that Adipose treatment is fabulous.

473
00:34:31,620 --> 00:34:33,510
just look at my chin.

474
00:34:33,950 --> 00:34:36,990
And it's very good for back fat,
I'm down two sizes.

475
00:34:36,990 --> 00:34:38,740
It's like a miracle.

476
00:34:38,740 --> 00:34:41,090
All that from just one little pill.

477
00:34:41,090 --> 00:34:42,900
And I've been eating like normal.

478
00:34:45,430 --> 00:34:46,310
You all right, love?

479
00:34:46,310 --> 00:34:49,470
Yeah, I'm just.

480
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:53,360
Funny sort of feeling, like it's.

481
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:54,510
What's happened?

482
00:34:54,510 --> 00:34:55,460
I'm not sure.

483
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:56,840
it just seems to be...

484
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:59,680
Better pop to the loo.

485
00:35:00,850 --> 00:35:03,110
- Oh, my God, Suzette!
- What?

486
00:35:07,970 --> 00:35:09,040
What is it?

487
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:11,490
Get it off me!

488
00:36:17,450 --> 00:36:19,580
Come to me, children.

489
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:22,190
Come to me.

490
00:36:22,790 --> 00:36:25,460
Everyone get back, don't touch them.

491
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:37,550
So far they're just losing weight,

492
00:36:37,550 --> 00:36:39,800
but the Matron's gone up to emergency parthenogenesis.

493
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:41,020
And that's when they convert?

494
00:36:41,020 --> 00:36:42,870
Skeletons, organs, everything.

495
00:36:42,870 --> 00:36:44,490
A million people are gonna die!

496
00:36:53,310 --> 00:36:55,030
Gotta cancel the signal.

497
00:36:56,230 --> 00:36:57,850
This contains the primary signal.

498
00:36:57,850 --> 00:37:00,560
If I can switch it off,
the fat goes back to being just fat.

499
00:37:01,290 --> 00:37:02,930
A nice try.

500
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:04,910
Double strength.

501
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:08,340
'Inducer increasing.

502
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:09,650
' No, no, no, no, no, she's doubled it, I need.

503
00:37:10,580 --> 00:37:11,900
Haven't got time.

504
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:13,870
It's too far, I can't override it.

505
00:37:14,310 --> 00:37:15,860
They're all gonna die!

506
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:21,220
Is there anything I can do?

507
00:37:21,220 --> 00:37:22,720
Sorry, this is way beyond you.

508
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:24,590
Gotta double the base pulse...

509
00:37:24,590 --> 00:37:26,890
Doctor, tell me, what do you need?

510
00:37:26,890 --> 00:37:29,890
I need a second capsule to boost the override,
but I've only got the one.

511
00:37:29,890 --> 00:37:31,610
I can't save them!

512
00:37:50,740 --> 00:37:52,490
It's stopped.

513
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:55,610
They've gone.

514
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:12,450
What's happened?

515
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:17,850
I think the Doctor happened.

516
00:38:18,650 --> 00:38:22,180
But we've still given birth to 10,000 Adipose.

517
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:25,060
And the Nursery is coming.

518
00:38:28,010 --> 00:38:29,700
What the hell was that?

519
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:33,230
It s my lift home.

520
00:38:38,390 --> 00:38:40,640
You can't just leave me here!

521
00:38:41,750 --> 00:38:43,570
It just stopped.

522
00:38:46,820 --> 00:38:50,020
What on earth is it now?

523
00:38:51,020 --> 00:38:53,420
Oh, my god.

524
00:39:19,370 --> 00:39:20,820
Fine.

525
00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:23,480
When you say 'nursery',
you don't mean a creche in Notting Hill?

526
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:25,430
Nursery ship.

527
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:28,470
'Incoming signal.

528
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:34,300
Hadn't we better go and stop them?

529
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:38,220
Instructions from the Adiposian first family.

530
00:39:38,220 --> 00:39:39,900
Children!

531
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,640
0h, my children, be hold.

532
00:39:44,210 --> 00:39:47,780
I am taking you home.

533
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:53,510
Far across the galaxy, your new mummies
and daddies are waiting.

534
00:39:53,510 --> 00:39:56,120
And you will fly!

535
00:40:00,070 --> 00:40:02,360
Up you go, babies.

536
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:04,360
Up you go!

537
00:40:08,010 --> 00:40:11,230
That's it, fly away home!

538
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:14,930
She's wired up the tower block to
convert it into a levitation post.

539
00:40:19,450 --> 00:40:22,220
We're not the ones in trouble now.

540
00:40:22,930 --> 00:40:24,530
She is!

541
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:30,760
Take me.

542
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:33,240
The children need me!

543
00:40:44,250 --> 00:40:46,150
What you gonna do, then?

544
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:47,740
Blow them up?

545
00:40:47,740 --> 00:40:48,420
They're just children.

546
00:40:48,420 --> 00:40:50,410
They can't help where they came from.

547
00:40:50,410 --> 00:40:52,900
That makes a change from last time.

548
00:40:53,850 --> 00:40:56,090
That Martha must've done you good.

549
00:40:57,790 --> 00:40:59,630
Ah, she did.

550
00:40:59,630 --> 00:41:02,720
Yeah, yeah, she did.

551
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:05,540
She fancied me.

552
00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:07,510
Mad Martha, that one.

553
00:41:07,510 --> 00:41:08,340
Blind Martha.

554
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:09,930
Charity Martha.

555
00:41:15,850 --> 00:41:18,020
I'm waving at fat.

556
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:21,920
Actually, as a diet plan, it sort of works.

557
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:23,360
There she is!

558
00:41:27,110 --> 00:41:29,360
Matron Cofelia, listen to me!

559
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:31,650
0h, I don't think so, Doctor.

560
00:41:31,650 --> 00:41:34,480
And if I never see you again, it'll be too soon.

561
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:35,620
Why does no-one ever listen?

562
00:41:35,620 --> 00:41:36,600
I'm trying to help!

563
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:37,920
just get across to the roof.

564
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:39,340
Can you shift the levitation beam?

565
00:41:39,340 --> 00:41:42,160
What, so that you can arrest me?

566
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:46,790
I saw the Adiposian instructions -
they know it's a crime, breeding on earth.

567
00:41:46,790 --> 00:41:48,570
So what's the one thing they want to get rid of?

568
00:41:48,570 --> 00:41:50,170
Their accomplice!

569
00:41:50,170 --> 00:41:52,820
I'm far more than that.

570
00:41:52,820 --> 00:41:57,790
I'm nanny to all these children.

571
00:41:57,790 --> 00:42:02,050
????Mum and Dad have got the kids now,
they don't need the nanny anymore.

572
00:42:29,250 --> 00:42:31,170
Oi, you two!

573
00:42:31,170 --> 00:42:32,790
You're just mad.

574
00:42:32,790 --> 00:42:33,930
Do you hear me?

575
00:42:33,930 --> 00:42:34,960
Mad!

576
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:36,590
And I'm gonna report you for...

577
00:42:37,050 --> 00:42:38,720
madness!

578
00:42:42,990 --> 00:42:46,360
You see, some people just can't take it.

579
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:50,480
NOPe` And some people can.

580
00:42:50,890 --> 00:42:52,170
So, then...

581
00:42:52,170 --> 00:42:53,780
Tardis!

582
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:55,220
Come on!

583
00:42:57,160 --> 00:42:58,810
That's my car!

584
00:43:01,060 --> 00:43:02,660
That is like destiny.

585
00:43:03,420 --> 00:43:05,230
And I've been ready for this.

586
00:43:05,230 --> 00:43:07,560
I packed ages ago, just in case.

587
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:13,500
Cos I thought, hot weather, cold weather, no weather -

588
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:17,300
he goes anywhere, I've gotta be prepared.

589
00:43:18,310 --> 00:43:21,590
You've got a hatbox.

590
00:43:22,290 --> 00:43:25,370
Planet of the Hats, I'm ready!

591
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:27,760
Do I need injections?

592
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:30,840
Like when you go to Cambodia, is there any of that?

593
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:33,280
Cos my friend Veena went to Bahrain, and...

594
00:43:36,020 --> 00:43:37,850
You're not saying much.

595
00:43:38,570 --> 00:43:40,030
No, it's just.

596
00:43:42,650 --> 00:43:46,770
It's a funny old life, in the Tardis.

597
00:43:46,770 --> 00:43:48,460
You don't want me.

598
00:43:48,460 --> 00:43:50,270
I'm not saying that.

599
00:43:51,700 --> 00:43:53,690
But you asked me.

600
00:43:56,320 --> 00:43:58,340
Would you rather be on your own?

601
00:43:58,340 --> 00:43:59,880
No.

602
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:01,290
Actually, no.

603
00:44:01,290 --> 00:44:02,580
But...

604
00:44:07,250 --> 00:44:11,860
The last time, with Martha, like I said...

605
00:44:13,470 --> 00:44:15,270
it got complicated.

606
00:44:18,700 --> 00:44:20,770
And that was all my fault.

607
00:44:24,510 --> 00:44:26,590
I just want a mate.

608
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:29,780
You just want T0 MATE?

609
00:44:29,780 --> 00:44:31,840
I just want A mate!

610
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:33,670
You're not mating with me, sunshine!

611
00:44:33,670 --> 00:44:36,840
A mate, I want a mate!

612
00:44:37,170 --> 00:44:39,630
just as well, because I'm not having any of that nonsense.

613
00:44:39,630 --> 00:44:44,200
I mean, you're just a long streak of nothing, alien nothing.

614
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:45,490
There we are, then.

615
00:44:46,230 --> 00:44:47,560
OK.

616
00:44:50,700 --> 00:44:52,020
I can come?

617
00:44:52,020 --> 00:44:53,270
Yeah.

618
00:44:53,270 --> 00:44:54,710
Course you can, yeah.

619
00:44:56,670 --> 00:44:58,200
I'd love it.

620
00:44:58,670 --> 00:45:00,700
Ohh, that's just...

621
00:45:01,220 --> 00:45:01,990
Car keys!

622
00:45:01,990 --> 00:45:03,100
What?

623
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:04,720
I've still got my mum's car keys!

624
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:06,160
I won't be a minute.

625
00:45:16,540 --> 00:45:19,270
I know, Mum, I saw it, little fat people.

626
00:45:19,270 --> 00:45:20,420
I've got to go.

627
00:45:20,420 --> 00:45:21,860
I'm going to stay with Veena for a bit.

628
00:45:21,860 --> 00:45:22,790
'It was in the sky.

629
00:45:22,790 --> 00:45:24,980
' I know, spaceship.

630
00:45:24,980 --> 00:45:27,150
But I've still got the car keys.

631
00:45:28,220 --> 00:45:32,280
There's a bin on Brook Street 30 feet from the corner, I'm going to leave them in there.

632
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:33,320
'What? A bin?

633
00:45:33,320 --> 00:45:34,670
' Yes, I said 'bin'.

634
00:45:34,670 --> 00:45:35,500
'You can't do that.

635
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:37,820
Oh, stop complaining, the car'sjust down the road a bit.

636
00:45:37,820 --> 00:45:40,510
Got to go, really got to go.

637
00:45:40,510 --> 00:45:41,180
Bye.

638
00:45:41,180 --> 00:45:42,770
'But Donna, you can't...

639
00:45:44,680 --> 00:45:49,400
' There's this woman that's going to come along, tall blond woman called Sylvia,

640
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:51,430
tell her that bin there.

641
00:45:51,430 --> 00:45:52,400
It'll make sense.

642
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:53,900
That bin there.

643
00:46:22,530 --> 00:46:23,820
Off we go, then!

644
00:46:23,820 --> 00:46:26,150
Here it is, the Tardis.

645
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:28,140
Bigger on the inside than it is on the outside.

646
00:46:28,140 --> 00:46:29,870
0h, I know all that bit.

647
00:46:30,590 --> 00:46:33,800
Although frankly, you could turn the heating up.

648
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:37,460
So, whole wide universe

649
00:46:38,600 --> 00:46:40,130
where do you want to go?

650
00:46:40,940 --> 00:46:42,780
I know exactly the place.

651
00:46:42,780 --> 00:46:44,080
Which is?

652
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:46,730
Two and a half miles that way.

653
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:58,320
Donna!

654
00:46:58,320 --> 00:47:00,170
It's the flying blue box!

655
00:47:06,220 --> 00:47:08,260
What?

656
00:47:10,690 --> 00:47:12,080
That's Donna.

657
00:47:12,080 --> 00:47:14,130
That's Donna.

658
00:47:14,930 --> 00:47:16,190
And that's him!

659
00:47:16,190 --> 00:47:17,470
That's him!

660
00:47:21,390 --> 00:47:22,830
Go on, girl!

661
00:47:22,830 --> 00:47:25,570
Go on, get up there!

662
00:47:26,040 --> 00:47:27,660
Hey...

663
00:47:32,660 --> 00:47:33,920
Ancient Rome.

664
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:35,410
This is fantastic.

665
00:47:35,410 --> 00:47:37,750
It has come, the blue box.

666
00:47:37,750 --> 00:47:39,880
I see the most terrible things.

667
00:47:40,320 --> 00:47:42,390
The prophecies of women are limited and dull.

668
00:47:42,390 --> 00:47:45,470
Only the menfolk have the capacity for true perception.

669
00:47:45,470 --> 00:47:47,410
I tell you where the wind's blowing now.

670
00:47:47,410 --> 00:47:50,320
Doctor, you bring bad luck.

671
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:53,790
We are building the future as dictated by the gods.

672
00:47:53,790 --> 00:47:56,040
I demand you tell me who you are.

673
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:57,060
Doctor!

674
00:47:57,060 --> 00:47:59,050
The sky is falling.

675
00:47:59,050 --> 00:48:00,500
We're in Pompeii!

676
00:48:01,220 --> 00:48:02,990
And it's volcano day.
