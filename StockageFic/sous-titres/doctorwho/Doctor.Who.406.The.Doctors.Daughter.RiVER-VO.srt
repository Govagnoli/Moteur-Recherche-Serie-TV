1
00:00:03,999 --> 00:00:06,925
- What the hell's it doing?!
- Control's not working!

2
00:00:07,936 --> 00:00:11,124
I don't know where we're going, but
my old hand's very excited about it!

3
00:00:11,159 --> 00:00:14,799
I thought that was just
some freaky alien thing!
You telling me it's yours? Well...

4
00:00:14,834 --> 00:00:16,760
It got cut off. He grew a new one.

5
00:00:17,984 --> 00:00:24,382
You are completely...impossible! Not
impossible...just a bit unlikely.

6
00:00:41,079 --> 00:00:43,440
Why would the TARDIS bring us here?

7
00:00:43,475 --> 00:00:45,444
Oh, I love this bit.

8
00:00:45,479 --> 00:00:48,619
Thought you wanted to go home.
I know, but all the same...

9
00:00:48,654 --> 00:00:51,759
It's that feeling you get...
Like you've swallowed a hamster?

10
00:00:51,794 --> 00:00:54,165
Don't move! Drop your weapons!

11
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:58,045
We're not armed! Look, no weapons,
never any weapons, we're safe.

12
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:01,959
Look at their hands. They're clean.
All right. Process them. Him first.

13
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,205
Oi. Oi!

14
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:07,760
What's wrong with clean hands?

15
00:01:07,795 --> 00:01:10,245
What's going on?
Leave him alone!

16
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:14,284
Something tells me this isn't about
to check my blood pressure. Aarrgh!

17
00:01:14,319 --> 00:01:19,279
What're you doing to him?!
Everyone gets processed!
It's taken a tissue sample.

18
00:01:19,314 --> 00:01:20,765
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

19
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:24,639
And extrapolated it.
Some kind of accelerator?

20
00:01:27,279 --> 00:01:29,404
Are you all right?

21
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:33,000
What on earth? That's just...

22
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:46,800
Arm yourself.

23
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:52,320
Where did she come from? From me.

24
00:01:52,355 --> 00:01:54,444
From you?!

25
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:58,919
How? Who is she?! Well, she's...

26
00:01:58,954 --> 00:02:01,405
Well...

27
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:03,840
She's my daughter.

28
00:02:03,875 --> 00:02:06,560
Hello, Dad!

00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000

33
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,485
You primed to take orders,
ready to fight?

34
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:53,159
Instant mental download of strategic
and military protocols, sir.
Generation 5000 Soldier. I'm ready.

35
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:59,040
Did you say daughter? Mmm.
Technically. Technically how?

36
00:02:59,075 --> 00:03:02,205
Progenation.
Reproduction from a single organism.

37
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:06,379
You take a sample of diploid cells,
split them into haploids,

38
00:03:06,414 --> 00:03:10,519
then recombine them in a
different arrangement...and grow.

39
00:03:10,554 --> 00:03:12,919
Very quickly, apparently!
Something's coming!

40
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:21,600
It's the Hath! Get down!

41
00:03:29,319 --> 00:03:32,000
We have to blow the tunnel!
Get the detonator!

42
00:03:32,035 --> 00:03:34,839
I'm not detonating anything!

43
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:49,359
Blow the thing! Martha! No! Don't!

44
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:14,839
You've sealed off the tunnel.
Why did you do that?!
They were trying to kill us!

45
00:04:14,874 --> 00:04:17,884
But they've got my friend.
Collateral damage.

46
00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:21,324
At least you've still got her.
He lost both his men.

47
00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:28,279
Her name's Martha, and she's not
collateral damage, not for anyone!
Have you got that, GI Jane?!

48
00:04:28,314 --> 00:04:31,324
I'm going to find her.

49
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:36,639
You're going nowhere.
You don't make sense, you two,
no guns, no marks, no fight in you...

50
00:04:38,079 --> 00:04:41,200
I'm taking you to General Cobb!
Now, move.

51
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:08,400
Hold on,
I've got you, is it your arm, yeah?

52
00:05:08,435 --> 00:05:10,959
GURGLING
Is that a yes?

53
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:17,000
Let me examine it. Keep still.

54
00:05:17,035 --> 00:05:19,037
Still, yeah?

55
00:05:19,072 --> 00:05:21,040
No move!

56
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:27,080
Half fish, half human,

57
00:05:27,115 --> 00:05:29,605
how'm I supposed to know?

58
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:33,320
Is that a shoulder?
Feels like a shoulder!

59
00:05:33,355 --> 00:05:36,159
I think it's dislocated.

60
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:46,799
I'm trying to help him.
I am a doctor, and he is my
patient, and I'm not leaving him.

61
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:53,079
Now, this is gonna hurt.

62
00:05:53,114 --> 00:05:57,240
One, two, three.

63
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:13,800
Now, then. I'm Doctor Martha Jones.

64
00:06:13,835 --> 00:06:16,084
Who the hell are you?

65
00:06:16,119 --> 00:06:19,324
I'm Donna. What's your name?

66
00:06:19,359 --> 00:06:22,324
Don't know. It's not been assigned.

67
00:06:22,359 --> 00:06:26,339
Well, if you don't know that,
what do you know? How to fight.

68
00:06:26,374 --> 00:06:30,320
Nothing else? The machine must
embed military history and tactics

69
00:06:30,355 --> 00:06:34,519
but no name.
She's a generated anomaly.

70
00:06:34,554 --> 00:06:38,116
Generated anomaly? Jenny-rated.

71
00:06:38,151 --> 00:06:41,735
Well, what about that? Jenny!

72
00:06:41,770 --> 00:06:45,285
Jenny. Yeah, I like that, Jenny.

73
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:50,124
What d'you think, "Dad"?
Good as anything, I suppose.

74
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:55,719
Not what you'd call a natural parent,
are you? They stole a tissue sample
at gunpoint and processed it.

75
00:06:55,754 --> 00:06:58,525
It's not what I'd call
natural parenting. Rubbish.

76
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:02,565
You can't extrapolate a relationship
from a biological accident.
Er, Child Support Agency can.

77
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:07,440
Just because I share physiological
traits with simian primates doesn't
make me a monkey's uncle, does it?

78
00:07:07,475 --> 00:07:10,440
I'm not a monkey!

79
00:07:10,475 --> 00:07:12,324
Or a child.

80
00:07:12,359 --> 00:07:18,039
So where are we? What planet's this?
Messaline. Well, what's left of it.

81
00:07:18,074 --> 00:07:22,280
663 - 75 deceased.

82
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:27,960
Generation 6671 extinct...

83
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:36,480
Generation 6672 - 46 deceased.
Generation 6680 - 14 deceased.

84
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:46,000
But...this is a theatre!
Maybe they're doing Miss Saigon.

85
00:07:47,559 --> 00:07:49,684
It's like a town, or a city,

86
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:53,404
But why? General Cobb, I presume?

87
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:56,284
Found in the western tunnels,
I'm told, with no marks.

88
00:07:56,319 --> 00:08:02,359
There was an outbreak of pacifism in
the Eastern Zone, three generations
back, before we lost contact,

89
00:08:02,394 --> 00:08:08,080
is that where you came from? Eastern
Zone, yeah. I'm the Doctor.
This is Donna. And I'm Jenny.

90
00:08:08,115 --> 00:08:10,800
Don't think you can infect
us with your peacemaking.

91
00:08:10,835 --> 00:08:12,805
We're committed to the fight.

92
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:15,484
I can't stay anyway,
gotta go and find my friend.

93
00:08:15,519 --> 00:08:19,119
That's not possible. All
movement is regulated. We're at war.

94
00:08:19,154 --> 00:08:21,005
Yes. I noticed. With the Hath.

95
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:28,000
But tell me, cos we got a bit out
of circulation, Eastern Zone and all
that, so...who exactly are the Hath?

96
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:08,605
Back at the dawn of this planet,
these ancient halls were carved
from the earth.

97
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:16,280
Our ancestors dreamt of a new
beginning, a colony where Human and
Hath would work and live together.

98
00:09:16,315 --> 00:09:20,857
So what happened? The dream died -
broken, along with Hath promises.

99
00:09:20,892 --> 00:09:25,364
They wanted it all for themselves.
But the early pioneers fought back.

100
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:31,560
They used the machines to produce
soldiers instead of colonists,
and began this battle for survival.

101
00:09:31,595 --> 00:09:36,120
There's nothing but earth outside,
why's that? Why build underground?

102
00:09:36,155 --> 00:09:38,205
The surface is too dangerous.

103
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:41,884
Then why build windows?
And what does this mean?

104
00:09:41,919 --> 00:09:45,999
The rites and symbols of our
ancestors.
The meanings...lost in time.

105
00:09:46,034 --> 00:09:50,079
How long's this war gone on for?
Longer than anyone can remember.

106
00:09:50,114 --> 00:09:53,417
Countless generations,
marked only by the dead.

107
00:09:53,452 --> 00:09:56,685
What, fighting all this time?
Because we must.

108
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:00,080
Every child of the machine
is born with this knowledge.

109
00:10:00,115 --> 00:10:03,119
It's our inheritance.
It's all we know.

110
00:10:03,154 --> 00:10:05,880
How to fight. And how to die.

111
00:10:17,799 --> 00:10:21,005
Right...

112
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:23,640
So, we're here?

113
00:10:27,799 --> 00:10:31,859
Does this show the entire city?
Including the Hath zones? Yes. Why?

114
00:10:31,894 --> 00:10:35,885
Well, it'll help us find Martha.
We've more important things to do.

115
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:41,804
The Progenation Machines are powered
down, but we could breed
a whole platoon from you two.

116
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:47,920
I'm not having sons and daughters
by some great big machine! Sorry,
no offence, but you're not real.

117
00:10:47,955 --> 00:10:51,360
You're no better than him!
I have a body, I have a mind,

118
00:10:51,395 --> 00:10:54,519
I have independent thought,
how am I not real?

119
00:10:54,554 --> 00:10:56,605
What makes you better than me?

120
00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:00,859
Well said. We need more like you
if ever we're to find the Source.

121
00:11:00,894 --> 00:11:05,079
Ooh, the Source, what's that then?
I like a Source, what is it?

122
00:11:05,114 --> 00:11:08,445
The Breath of Life.
And that would be?

123
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:12,759
In the beginning, the Great One
breathed life into the universe.

124
00:11:12,794 --> 00:11:17,756
Then she looked at what she'd done
and she sighed. She? I like that.

125
00:11:17,791 --> 00:11:22,719
Right, so it's a creation myth. It's
not myth. It's real. That sigh,

126
00:11:22,754 --> 00:11:25,844
it was caught and kept
as the Source.

127
00:11:25,879 --> 00:11:29,725
It was lost when the war started.
But it's here, somewhere.

128
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:33,879
Whoever holds the Source controls
the destiny of this planet. Ah!

129
00:11:33,914 --> 00:11:37,999
I thought so. There's a suppressed
layer of information in this map.

130
00:11:38,034 --> 00:11:39,999
If I can just...

131
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:46,520
What is it? See? A whole complex
of tunnels, hidden from sight.

132
00:11:47,919 --> 00:11:50,964
Hold on, look!

133
00:11:50,999 --> 00:11:54,924
That must be the lost temple.
The Source will be inside.

134
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:59,880
You've shown us the way! And we're
closer than the Hath! It's ours!

135
00:11:59,915 --> 00:12:02,480
That's a new map.
There's a different set of tunnels.

136
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:10,639
Tell them to prepare to move out.
We'll progenate new soldiers on
the morning shift, then we march!

137
00:12:10,674 --> 00:12:13,764
Once we reach the Temple, peace
will be restored at long last.

138
00:12:13,799 --> 00:12:19,239
If you really wanted peace,
couldn't you just stop fighting?
Only when we have the Source.

139
00:12:19,274 --> 00:12:23,840
It'll give us the power to
erase every stinking Hath
from the face of this planet.

140
00:12:23,875 --> 00:12:27,577
A second ago, it was peace in our
time, now you're talking genocide?!

141
00:12:27,612 --> 00:12:31,245
For us, that means the same thing.
Then you need a better dictionary!

142
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:36,360
Look up genocide. You'll see a
picture of me there and the caption
will read "over my dead body"!

143
00:12:36,395 --> 00:12:39,817
You're the one who showed us
the path to victory.

144
00:12:39,852 --> 00:12:43,204
But you can consider the irony
from your prison cell.

145
00:12:43,239 --> 00:12:47,739
Cline, at arms! Oi oi! All right!
Cool the beans, Rambo. Take them.

146
00:12:47,774 --> 00:12:52,240
And if you try anything, Doctor,
I'll see that your woman dies first.

147
00:12:52,275 --> 00:12:54,964
I am not his woman!
W-We're not a couple!

148
00:12:54,999 --> 00:12:58,004
Come on. This way. I'm going to stop
you, Cobb.

149
00:12:58,039 --> 00:13:02,765
I have an army and the breath of god
on my side. What'll you have? This.

150
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:09,680
Lock them up. What about the new
soldier? Can't trust her. She's from
pacifist stock. Take them all!

151
00:13:13,479 --> 00:13:20,319
But I didn't do anything!

152
00:13:22,999 --> 00:13:25,559
I think I just started a war.

153
00:13:30,999 --> 00:13:34,965
More numbers.
They've gotta mean something.

154
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,399
Makes as much sense
as the breath of life story.

155
00:13:38,434 --> 00:13:40,404
You mean that's not true?

156
00:13:40,439 --> 00:13:43,324
No. It's a myth. Isn't it, Doctor?

157
00:13:43,359 --> 00:13:49,485
Yes. But there could be something
real in that temple, something
that's become a myth. A weapon?

158
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:55,880
So the Source could be a weapon
and we've given directions to Captain
Nutjob? Oh, yes. Not good, is it?

159
00:13:55,915 --> 00:14:00,400
We need to get out of here,
find Martha and stop Cobb
from slaughtering the Hath.

160
00:14:00,435 --> 00:14:03,879
What, what are you...
What are you staring at?

161
00:14:03,914 --> 00:14:06,765
You keep insisting
you're not a soldier.

162
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,885
But look at you. Drawing up
strategies like a proper general.

163
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:17,000
No, I'm trying to stop the fighting.
Isn't every soldier? Well.
I suppose. But...that's...that's...

164
00:14:17,035 --> 00:14:20,925
Donna, give me your phone!
Time for an upgrade!

165
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:24,765
You've got a weapon!
It's not a weapon!
You're using it to fight back!

166
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:30,999
I'm gonna learn so much from you,
you are such a soldier!
Donna, will you tell her?

167
00:14:31,034 --> 00:14:35,479
Oh, you are speechless, I'm
loving this! You keep on, Jenny!

168
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:42,999
Doctor? Martha! You're alive! Oh,
am I glad to hear your voice!
Are you all right?

169
00:14:43,034 --> 00:14:45,885
I'm with Donna, we're fine,
what about you?

170
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:49,604
And Jenny, she's fine too!
Yes, all right, and Jenny...

171
00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:56,200
That's the woman from the machine,
the soldier, my daughter, except
she isn't... Anyway! Where are you?

172
00:14:56,235 --> 00:15:00,124
I'm in the Hath camp.
I'm OK. But something's going on.

173
00:15:00,159 --> 00:15:03,364
The Hath are marching off to some
place that appeared on this map.

174
00:15:03,399 --> 00:15:10,359
Ohhh... That was me.
If both armies are heading that way,
there's going to be a bloodbath.

175
00:15:10,394 --> 00:15:13,840
What do you want me to do?
Just stay where you are.

176
00:15:13,875 --> 00:15:17,765
But I can help.
PHONE BEEPS
Doctor? Doctor!

177
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:22,419
The doors that have been closed
will be open to us now.

178
00:15:22,454 --> 00:15:27,039
The door to the Temple,
to the Source, and to Victory!

179
00:15:32,199 --> 00:15:38,324
Come the dawn cycle we march.
CHANTING

180
00:15:38,359 --> 00:15:42,560
They're getting ready to move out.
We have to get past that guard.

181
00:15:42,595 --> 00:15:45,724
I can deal with him. No, no.
You're not going anywhere. What?

182
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:51,525
You belong here. With them.
She belongs with us. With you.
She's your daughter!

183
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:57,200
She's a soldier. She came out of
that machine! I know!
Have you got that stethoscope?

184
00:15:57,235 --> 00:15:58,920
Give it to me.

185
00:15:58,955 --> 00:16:00,519
Come on!

186
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:08,960
What're you doing?
It's all right. Just hold still.

187
00:16:17,319 --> 00:16:19,804
Come here. Listen.

188
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:22,760
And then tell me where she belongs.

189
00:16:43,239 --> 00:16:47,965
Two hearts. Exactly. What's going
on? Does that mean she's a...?

190
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:53,725
What do you call a female Time Lord?
What's a Time Lord? It's who I am.

191
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:59,720
It's where I'm from. And I'm from
you. You're an echo, that's all.
A Time Lord is so much more.

192
00:16:59,755 --> 00:17:04,839
A sum of knowledge. A code. A shared
history. A shared suffering.

193
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:09,120
Only it's gone now. All of it.

194
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,980
Gone forever.

195
00:17:15,015 --> 00:17:17,480
What happened?

196
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:22,000
There was a war. Like this one?

197
00:17:27,399 --> 00:17:29,099
And you fought?

198
00:17:29,134 --> 00:17:30,800
And killed?

199
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:35,885
Yes.

200
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:39,760
Then how are we different?

201
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:46,280
I need to charge it up,
I need power, d'you understand?

202
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:54,679
There's even more! In 3D!
Oh, you're a clever Hath!

203
00:17:54,714 --> 00:17:57,005
So this is where everybody's headed?

204
00:17:57,040 --> 00:18:00,685
But look...
those tunnels sort of zig-zag.

205
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:04,800
If I went up and over the surface in
a straight line, I'd get there first.

206
00:18:04,835 --> 00:18:06,320
Why not?

207
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:12,079
Are these the readings for the
surface? It doesn't look too bad.

208
00:18:12,114 --> 00:18:14,617
Nitrogen and oxygen about 80:20.

209
00:18:14,652 --> 00:18:17,120
That's fine. Ozone levels are high.

210
00:18:17,155 --> 00:18:19,324
And some big radiation spikes.

211
00:18:19,359 --> 00:18:22,519
But as long as I'm
not out there too long.

212
00:18:22,554 --> 00:18:24,320
I have to find my friends.

213
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:32,640
Come on, then.

214
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:35,280
Hey.

215
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:39,680
I'm not supposed to talk to you.
I'm on duty. I know.

216
00:18:39,715 --> 00:18:42,804
Guarding me.

217
00:18:42,839 --> 00:18:46,160
So does that mean I'm dangerous?

218
00:18:46,195 --> 00:18:47,960
Or that I need protecting?

219
00:18:47,995 --> 00:18:49,925
Protecting from what?

220
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:52,680
Oh, I don't know. Men like you?

221
00:18:58,359 --> 00:19:02,880
Keep quiet and open the door.

222
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,959
I'd like to see you try that!

223
00:19:19,959 --> 00:19:23,040
Let me distract this one.

224
00:19:24,119 --> 00:19:28,640
I have picked up a few womanly wiles
over the years.

225
00:19:28,675 --> 00:19:32,679
Let's save your wiles for later.

226
00:19:32,714 --> 00:19:35,440
In case of emergency.

227
00:19:55,920 --> 00:20:00,124
I was gonna distract him, not
clobber him! Well, it worked!

228
00:20:00,159 --> 00:20:07,040
They must all have
a copy of that new map.
Just stay there, don't hurt anyone.

229
00:20:30,879 --> 00:20:40,840
You can stay down here and live
your whole life in the shadows.

230
00:20:40,875 --> 00:20:45,120
It's up to you.
But nothing's gonna stop me.

231
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,440
I knew you couldn't resist it.

232
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:28,119
Er, language! ..Come on.

233
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:41,325
It was the girl. She tricked me.
They got away. I'm sorry.

234
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:48,279
I waited all my life for this
moment. No-one is going to get in
my way. Certainly not this Doctor.

235
00:21:48,314 --> 00:21:52,320
At arms! We march! To war!

236
00:21:52,355 --> 00:21:54,879
Wait!

237
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:58,924
The hidden tunnel.

238
00:21:58,959 --> 00:22:00,565
There must be a control panel.

239
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:03,885
It's another one of those numbers.
They're everywhere.

240
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:08,360
The original builders must've left
them. Some old cataloguing system.

241
00:22:08,395 --> 00:22:10,485
You got a pen? Bit of paper?

242
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:13,360
Cos, d'you see,
the numbers are counting down.

243
00:22:13,395 --> 00:22:15,297
This one ends in 1-4,

244
00:22:15,332 --> 00:22:17,164
the prison cell said 1-6.

245
00:22:17,199 --> 00:22:20,600
Always thinking, both of you.
Who are you people? I told you.

246
00:22:20,635 --> 00:22:22,004
I'm the Doctor. The Doctor?

247
00:22:22,039 --> 00:22:27,159
That's it?
That's all he ever says.

248
00:22:27,194 --> 00:22:29,164
No.

249
00:22:29,199 --> 00:22:32,619
Oh, come off it! You're the most
anomalous bloke I've ever met!

250
00:22:32,654 --> 00:22:36,040
Here it is! And Time Lords,
what are they for exactly? "For"?

251
00:22:36,075 --> 00:22:38,839
They're not...
They're not "for" anything.

252
00:22:38,874 --> 00:22:41,600
So what do you do? I travel.

253
00:22:41,635 --> 00:22:42,879
Through time and space.

254
00:22:42,914 --> 00:22:44,485
He saves planets,

255
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:46,564
rescues civilisations.

256
00:22:46,599 --> 00:22:48,279
defeats terrible creatures.

257
00:22:48,314 --> 00:22:49,325
And runs a lot.

258
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:52,400
Seriously, there's an outrageous
amount of running involved.

259
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:54,964
Got it!

260
00:22:54,999 --> 00:22:57,285
Squad 5, with me!

261
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:59,600
Now, what were you saying
about running?

262
00:23:12,639 --> 00:23:14,399
That's not mood lighting, is it?

263
00:23:20,199 --> 00:23:21,320
No, I didn't think so.

264
00:23:21,355 --> 00:23:23,199
Arming device.

265
00:23:26,839 --> 00:23:28,564
There's more of these.

266
00:23:28,599 --> 00:23:32,600
Always eight numbers, counting down,
the closer we get...

267
00:23:32,635 --> 00:23:34,204
Here we go!

268
00:23:34,239 --> 00:23:36,080
You better be quick! The General!

269
00:23:37,599 --> 00:23:41,000
Where are you going? I can hold them
up. No, we don't need any more dead.

270
00:23:41,035 --> 00:23:43,200
It's them or us. It doesn't mean
you have to kill them!

271
00:23:43,235 --> 00:23:44,719
But I'm trying to save your life!

272
00:23:44,754 --> 00:23:47,537
Listen to me, the killing,

273
00:23:47,572 --> 00:23:50,285
after a while it infects you.

274
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:52,324
And once it does
you're never rid of it.

275
00:23:52,359 --> 00:23:55,520
But we don't have a choice.
We always have a choice.

276
00:23:55,555 --> 00:23:58,239
I'm sorry. Jenny!

277
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:00,880
This door! Now!

278
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:05,919
There she is!

279
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:17,039
I told you. Nothing but a soldier.
She's trying to help.

280
00:24:25,559 --> 00:24:28,320
Jenny! Come on! I'm coming.

281
00:24:29,439 --> 00:24:31,959
Ceasefire! Ceasefire!

282
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:35,600
That's it!
Jenny! Leave it! Let's go!

283
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
You're a child of the machine.

284
00:24:39,035 --> 00:24:40,560
You're on my side.

285
00:24:40,595 --> 00:24:42,125
Join us!

286
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:44,845
Join us in the war against the Hath.

287
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:48,080
It's in your blood, girl,
don't deny it.

288
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:00,925
Jenny! Come on!

289
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:03,765
That's it! Hurry up!

290
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:06,004
No, no, no, no!
The circuit's looped back!

291
00:25:06,039 --> 00:25:09,199
Zap it back again!
The controls are back there!

292
00:25:09,234 --> 00:25:11,697
They're coming! Wait! J-Just...!

293
00:25:11,732 --> 00:25:13,685
There isn't...! Jenny, I can't!

294
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:15,639
I'll have to manage on my own.

295
00:25:18,879 --> 00:25:21,879
Watch and learn, Father!

296
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,599
No way!

297
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:34,599
That was impossible!
Not impossible.

298
00:25:34,634 --> 00:25:36,937
Just a bit unlikely! Brilliant!

299
00:25:36,972 --> 00:25:39,205
You were brilliant! Brilliant!

300
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:41,519
I didn't kill General Cobb.
I could have, but I didn't.

301
00:25:41,554 --> 00:25:43,440
You were right. I had a choice.

302
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:45,080
Spread out!

303
00:25:47,959 --> 00:25:49,564
I warned you, Cobb.

304
00:25:49,599 --> 00:25:53,000
If the Source is a weapon, I'm gonna
make sure you never use it.

305
00:25:53,035 --> 00:25:55,520
One of us is gonna die today
and it won't be me.

306
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:12,639
It can't be much further.

307
00:26:25,435 --> 00:26:27,440
Help me!

308
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:31,919
I'm sinking! I'm sinking! Help me!

309
00:26:31,954 --> 00:26:34,125
Peck! Help me!

310
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:37,760
Help me, Peck! I'm sinking!

311
00:26:37,795 --> 00:26:42,320
It's no good. Aah!

312
00:26:42,355 --> 00:26:43,719
Aah!

313
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:03,639
Noooo!

314
00:27:08,035 --> 00:27:09,759
No-oo-o!

315
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:38,639
So, you travel together,
but you're not "together"?

316
00:27:38,674 --> 00:27:41,884
What? No, no! No way!

317
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:44,879
No, no. We're friends. That's all.

318
00:27:44,914 --> 00:27:47,676
We're not even the same species.

319
00:27:47,711 --> 00:27:50,439
And what's it like, the travelling?

320
00:27:50,474 --> 00:27:51,924
Never a dull moment.

321
00:27:51,959 --> 00:27:55,200
Can be terrifying,
brilliant and funny -

322
00:27:55,235 --> 00:27:57,324
sometimes all at the same time.

323
00:27:57,359 --> 00:28:00,960
I've seen some amazing things though.
Whole new worlds.

324
00:28:00,995 --> 00:28:03,617
Oh, I'd love to see new worlds.

325
00:28:03,652 --> 00:28:06,240
You will. Won't she, Doctor?

326
00:28:06,275 --> 00:28:07,324
Hm?

327
00:28:07,359 --> 00:28:11,199
Do you think Jenny'll see
any new worlds?

328
00:28:11,234 --> 00:28:12,720
I suppose so.

329
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:14,964
You mean...

330
00:28:14,999 --> 00:28:18,319
You mean, you'll take me with you?
We can't leave you here, can we?

331
00:28:18,354 --> 00:28:20,805
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

332
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:24,840
Come on! Let's get a move on!
Careful, there might be traps!

333
00:28:24,875 --> 00:28:27,639
Kids! They never listen!

334
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:36,365
Oh, I know that look.
See it a lot round our way.

335
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:40,839
Blokes with pushchairs and frowns.
You've got dad-shock.

336
00:28:40,874 --> 00:28:43,404
Dad-shock?
Sudden, unexpected fatherhood.

337
00:28:43,439 --> 00:28:45,765
Take a bit of getting used to.
No, it's not that.

338
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:49,199
Well, what is it then? Having Jenny
in the TARDIS is that it?

339
00:28:49,234 --> 00:28:51,284
What's she gonna do,
cramp your style?

340
00:28:51,319 --> 00:28:54,160
Like you've got a sports car and
she'll turn it into a people-carrier?

341
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:57,800
Donna, I've been a father before.
What?

342
00:28:57,835 --> 00:28:59,319
I lost all that a long time ago.

343
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:02,520
Along with everything else.

344
00:29:02,555 --> 00:29:04,680
I'm sorry. I didn't know.

345
00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:08,079
Why didn't you tell me?

346
00:29:09,879 --> 00:29:12,800
You talk all the time,
but you don't say anything.

347
00:29:12,835 --> 00:29:14,280
I know. I'm just...

348
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:19,080
When I look at her now
I can see them.

349
00:29:21,399 --> 00:29:23,799
The hole they left.
All the pain that filled it.

350
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:30,279
I just don't know
if I can face that every day.

351
00:29:30,314 --> 00:29:32,000
It won't stay like that.

352
00:29:32,035 --> 00:29:33,297
She'll help you.

353
00:29:33,332 --> 00:29:34,560
We both will.

354
00:29:35,799 --> 00:29:38,520
But when they died,
that part of me died with them.

355
00:29:40,279 --> 00:29:42,200
It'll never come back. Not now.

356
00:29:43,799 --> 00:29:46,644
I tell you something, Doctor,

357
00:29:46,679 --> 00:29:48,960
something I've never told you before.

358
00:29:51,119 --> 00:29:52,920
I think you're wrong.

359
00:29:54,999 --> 00:29:58,960
They've blasted through the beams.
Time to run again! Love the running!

360
00:29:58,995 --> 00:30:00,400
Yeah? Love the running.

361
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:30,159
We're trapped.
Can't be. This must be the temple.

362
00:30:30,194 --> 00:30:33,360
This is a door.

363
00:30:33,395 --> 00:30:34,765
And again!

364
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:37,479
We're down to 1-2 now... I've got it!

365
00:30:37,514 --> 00:30:39,084
I can hear them! Nearly done.

366
00:30:39,119 --> 00:30:42,800
These can't be a cataloguing system.
They're getting closer! Get back!

367
00:30:42,835 --> 00:30:45,480
They're too similar. Too familiar.
Not yet. Now!

368
00:30:46,599 --> 00:30:47,600
Got it!

369
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:56,480
They're coming!

370
00:30:57,519 --> 00:30:59,319
Close the door!

371
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:03,399
That was close! No fun otherwise!

372
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:11,844
It's not what I'd call a temple...

373
00:31:11,879 --> 00:31:14,760
It looks more like...
Fusion-drive transport.

374
00:31:14,795 --> 00:31:16,765
It's a spaceship!

375
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:19,764
The original one? The one
the first colonists arrived in?

376
00:31:19,799 --> 00:31:23,679
Could be, but the power cells would
have run down after all that time.

377
00:31:23,714 --> 00:31:26,559
This one's still powered-up
and functioning. Come on!

378
00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:36,525
It's the Hath! That door's
not gonna last much longer.

379
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:39,480
If General Cobb gets through
down there, war's gonna break out.

380
00:31:39,515 --> 00:31:41,920
Look, look, look, look, look!

381
00:31:41,955 --> 00:31:43,285
Ship's log!

382
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:46,319
"First wave of Human - Hath
co-colonisation of Messaline".

383
00:31:46,354 --> 00:31:48,445
It is the original ship.
What happened?

384
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:52,279
"Phase one. Construction." They used
robot drones to build the city.

385
00:31:52,314 --> 00:31:55,440
But, does it mention the war?
Final entry...

386
00:31:55,475 --> 00:31:56,925
"Mission commander dead.

387
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:59,724
"Still no agreement on
who should assume leadership.

388
00:31:59,759 --> 00:32:02,360
"Hath and humans divided into
factions." That must be it!

389
00:32:02,395 --> 00:32:03,404
A power vacuum.

390
00:32:03,439 --> 00:32:06,199
The crew divided into two factions
and turned on each other.

391
00:32:06,234 --> 00:32:07,684
Start using the progenation machines

392
00:32:07,719 --> 00:32:10,599
and you've got two armies
fighting a never-ending war!

393
00:32:10,634 --> 00:32:13,480
Two armies who are now both outside.
Look at that.

394
00:32:13,515 --> 00:32:15,639
It's like the numbers
in the tunnels.

395
00:32:15,674 --> 00:32:17,245
No, no, no, no. But listen...

396
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:20,119
I spent six months working
as a temp in Hounslow Library,

397
00:32:20,154 --> 00:32:22,959
and I mastered the Dewey Decimal
System in two days flat.

398
00:32:22,994 --> 00:32:24,884
I'm good with numbers!

399
00:32:24,919 --> 00:32:27,319
It's staring us in the face! What is?

400
00:32:28,879 --> 00:32:30,120
It's the date!

401
00:32:31,479 --> 00:32:34,519
Assuming the first two numbers
are some big old space date,

402
00:32:34,554 --> 00:32:36,485
then you've got year, month, day.

403
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:38,960
It's the other way round,
like it is in America! Ohhh!

404
00:32:38,995 --> 00:32:41,404
It's the New Byzantine Calendar!

405
00:32:41,439 --> 00:32:44,560
The codes are completion dates
for each section.

406
00:32:44,595 --> 00:32:47,077
They finish it,
they stamp the date on!

407
00:32:47,112 --> 00:32:49,525
So the numbers aren't counting down,

408
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:52,959
they're going out,
from here, day by day,

409
00:32:52,994 --> 00:32:54,637
as the city got built.

410
00:32:54,672 --> 00:32:56,245
Yes! Oh, good work, Donna!

411
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:58,445
Yeah! But you're
still not getting it.

412
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:03,879
The first number I saw back there,
was 6012-07-17.

413
00:33:03,914 --> 00:33:05,640
Well, look at the date today!

414
00:33:05,675 --> 00:33:07,604
07-24. No!

415
00:33:07,639 --> 00:33:11,840
What does it mean?
Seven days? That's it!

416
00:33:11,875 --> 00:33:13,485
Seven days! Just seven days?!

417
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:16,959
What d'you mean, seven days?
Seven days since war broke out.

418
00:33:16,994 --> 00:33:19,120
This war started seven days ago!

419
00:33:19,155 --> 00:33:20,844
Just a week! A week!

420
00:33:20,879 --> 00:33:24,124
They said years!
No. They said generations.

421
00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:27,039
If they're all like you,
products of those machines...

422
00:33:27,074 --> 00:33:29,445
They could have 20 generations
in a day!

423
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:32,000
Each generation gets killed,
passes on the legend!

424
00:33:32,035 --> 00:33:33,645
Ohhh! Donna, you're a genius!

425
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:35,720
All the buildings, they're in ruins.

426
00:33:35,755 --> 00:33:37,760
They're not ruined!
They're just empty!

427
00:33:37,795 --> 00:33:39,685
Waiting to be populated!

428
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:42,679
Ohh, they've mythologised
their entire history!

429
00:33:42,714 --> 00:33:45,399
The Source must be part of that too.

430
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:51,244
Doctor! Martha!

431
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:53,880
I should've known you wouldn't
stay away from the excitement!

432
00:33:53,915 --> 00:33:56,680
Donna!!
Oooh, you're filthy, what happened?!

433
00:33:56,715 --> 00:33:58,760
I, erm, took the surface route.

434
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:01,364
That's the general!
We haven't much time.

435
00:34:01,399 --> 00:34:04,599
We don't know what we're looking for!
Is it me, or can you smell flowers?

436
00:34:04,634 --> 00:34:06,164
Yes!

437
00:34:06,199 --> 00:34:07,400
Bougainvillea!

438
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:10,804
I say we follow our nose!

439
00:34:10,839 --> 00:34:12,680
GENERAL: Blocks 7 to 10, advance!

440
00:34:12,715 --> 00:34:14,400
With me!

441
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:25,480
Oh, yes!

442
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:29,400
Yes!

443
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:34,320
Isn't this brilliant?

444
00:34:35,519 --> 00:34:37,339
Is that the Source?

445
00:34:37,374 --> 00:34:39,226
It's beautiful.

446
00:34:39,261 --> 00:34:40,970
What is it?

447
00:34:41,005 --> 00:34:42,644
Terraforming!

448
00:34:42,679 --> 00:34:45,680
It's a third generation
terraforming device!

449
00:34:45,715 --> 00:34:47,205
So why are we suddenly
in Kew Gardens?

450
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:49,800
Because that's what it does.
All this only bigger.

451
00:34:49,835 --> 00:34:51,604
Much bigger!
It's in a transit state.

452
00:34:51,639 --> 00:34:54,999
Producing this must help keep it
stable before they finally...

453
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:01,239
Stop! Hold your fire!

454
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:04,840
What is this? Some kind of trap?

455
00:35:04,875 --> 00:35:07,045
I want this war won.

456
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:11,040
You can't win. No-one can.
You don't even know why you're here.

457
00:35:11,075 --> 00:35:14,137
Your whole history,
it's just Chinese whispers.

458
00:35:14,172 --> 00:35:17,200
Getting more distorted
the more it's passed on.

459
00:35:17,235 --> 00:35:20,404
This is the Source.

460
00:35:20,439 --> 00:35:22,725
This is what you're fighting over.

461
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:27,080
A device to rejuvenate a planet's
ecosystem. It's nothing mystical.

462
00:35:27,115 --> 00:35:29,919
It's from a laboratory,
not some creator.

463
00:35:29,954 --> 00:35:32,445
It's a bubble of gases.

464
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:36,525
A cocktail of stuff
for accelerated evolution.

465
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:39,560
Methane, hydrogen, ammonia, amino
acids, proteins, nucleic acids.

466
00:35:39,595 --> 00:35:42,519
It's used to make
barren planets habitable.

467
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:45,644
Look around you!

468
00:35:45,679 --> 00:35:47,479
It's not for killing.

469
00:35:47,514 --> 00:35:49,245
It's bringing life.

470
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:54,999
If you allow it, it can lift you
out of these dark tunnels

471
00:35:55,034 --> 00:35:58,200
and into the bright,
bright sunlight!

472
00:36:00,159 --> 00:36:02,059
No more fighting.

473
00:36:02,094 --> 00:36:03,960
No more killing.

474
00:36:05,999 --> 00:36:07,924
I'm the Doctor

475
00:36:07,959 --> 00:36:10,920
and I declare this war is over!

476
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:51,484
What's happening?

477
00:36:51,519 --> 00:36:54,879
The gases will escape and trigger
the terraforming process.

478
00:36:54,914 --> 00:36:57,480
What does that mean?
It means a new world.

479
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:00,399
No!

480
00:37:03,399 --> 00:37:06,920
Jenny! Jenny! Talk to me, Jenny!

481
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:14,400
Is she gonna be all right?

482
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:28,240
(A new world.)

483
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:31,965
It's beautiful.

484
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,124
Jenny? Be strong, now.

485
00:37:34,159 --> 00:37:36,565
You need to hold on. D'you hear me?

486
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:40,279
We've got things to do,
you and me. Eh?

487
00:37:40,314 --> 00:37:42,885
Eh?

488
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:45,839
We can go anywhere.

489
00:37:45,874 --> 00:37:48,759
Everywhere. You choose.

490
00:37:50,359 --> 00:37:53,059
That sounds good.

491
00:37:53,094 --> 00:37:55,725
You're my daughter

492
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:57,559
and we've only just got started.

493
00:38:00,239 --> 00:38:01,879
You're gonna be great.

494
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:05,760
You're gonna be more than great.

495
00:38:05,795 --> 00:38:07,959
You're gonna be amazing.

496
00:38:07,994 --> 00:38:09,040
You hear me? Jenny?

497
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:36,604
Two hearts.

498
00:38:36,639 --> 00:38:38,120
Two hearts, she's like me.

499
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:40,765
If we wait...

500
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,844
If we just wait...

501
00:38:42,879 --> 00:38:45,124
There's no sign, Doctor.

502
00:38:45,159 --> 00:38:48,639
There's no regeneration.
She's like you, but...

503
00:38:48,674 --> 00:38:50,400
Maybe not enough.

504
00:38:50,435 --> 00:38:51,805
No.

505
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:53,000
Too much.

506
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:57,620
That's the truth of it.

507
00:38:57,655 --> 00:38:59,920
She was too much like me.

508
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:42,319
I never would.

509
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:46,599
Have you got that?

510
00:39:46,634 --> 00:39:48,919
I never would.

511
00:39:54,039 --> 00:39:55,959
When you start this new world...

512
00:39:57,720 --> 00:39:59,720
..this world of Human and Hath...

513
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:03,560
..remember that.

514
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:09,639
Make the foundation of this society

515
00:40:09,674 --> 00:40:12,400
a man who never would.

516
00:40:42,039 --> 00:40:43,719
It's happening.

517
00:40:43,754 --> 00:40:45,364
The terraforming.

518
00:40:45,399 --> 00:40:49,440
Build a city,
nice and safe underground.

519
00:40:49,475 --> 00:40:50,960
Strip away the top soil.

520
00:40:50,995 --> 00:40:52,800
And there it is.

521
00:40:54,959 --> 00:40:56,525
And what about Jenny?

522
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:59,679
Let us give her a proper ceremony.

523
00:40:59,714 --> 00:41:01,800
I think it would help us.

524
00:41:01,835 --> 00:41:03,280
Please.

525
00:41:10,479 --> 00:41:14,159
Jenny was the reason for
the TARDIS bringing us here.

526
00:41:14,194 --> 00:41:16,324
It just got here too soon,

527
00:41:16,359 --> 00:41:19,479
which then created Jenny
in the first place.

528
00:41:21,399 --> 00:41:23,325
Paradox.

529
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:25,439
An endless paradox.

530
00:41:29,799 --> 00:41:32,319
Time to go home? Yeah.

531
00:41:32,354 --> 00:41:33,480
Home.

532
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:55,400
You sure about this?

533
00:41:55,435 --> 00:41:57,925
Yeah, positive.

534
00:41:57,960 --> 00:42:00,040
I can't do this any more.

535
00:42:00,075 --> 00:42:02,120
You'll be the same one day.

536
00:42:02,155 --> 00:42:04,405
Not me. Never!

537
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:07,680
How could I ever go back to
normal life after seeing all this?

538
00:42:08,879 --> 00:42:10,920
I'm gonna travel
with that man for ever.

539
00:42:18,759 --> 00:42:20,520
Good luck. And you.

540
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:25,800
We're making a habit of this. Yeah.

541
00:42:25,835 --> 00:42:27,720
And you'd think it'd get easier.

542
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:32,119
All those things
you've been ready to die for.

543
00:42:32,154 --> 00:42:33,524
I thought for a moment there

544
00:42:33,559 --> 00:42:36,119
you'd finally found something
worth living for.

545
00:42:36,154 --> 00:42:37,524
Oh...

546
00:42:37,559 --> 00:42:40,240
There's always something
worth living for, Martha.

547
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:51,680
Bye, Doctor.

548
00:42:51,715 --> 00:42:52,977
Goodbye.

549
00:42:53,012 --> 00:42:54,240
Dr Jones.

550
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:35,240
Hello, boys.

551
00:43:39,879 --> 00:43:42,165
The shuttle!

552
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:46,839
Jenny? What're you doing? Come back!
Sorry. Can't stop.

553
00:43:46,874 --> 00:43:48,805
What you gonna do, tell my dad?

554
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:52,040
But where are you going?!
Ohh, I've got the whole universe!

555
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:54,244
Planets to save,

556
00:43:54,279 --> 00:43:56,079
civilisations to rescue,

557
00:43:56,114 --> 00:43:57,879
creatures to defeat.

558
00:44:00,439 --> 00:44:02,359
And an awful lot of running to do.

559
00:44:07,079 --> 00:44:08,560
Agatha Christie.

560
00:44:08,595 --> 00:44:09,600
What about her?

561
00:44:09,635 --> 00:44:10,697
That's me.

562
00:44:10,732 --> 00:44:11,760
Noooooooo!

563
00:44:12,680 --> 00:44:15,045
Murder! Chief Inspector Smith
from Scotland Yard,

564
00:44:15,080 --> 00:44:18,280
known as The Doctor. Miss Noble is
the plucky young girl who helps me.

565
00:44:18,315 --> 00:44:22,560
I say! There's a murder,
a mystery and Agatha Christie.

566
00:44:22,595 --> 00:44:24,840
So? It happens to me all the time.

567
00:44:24,875 --> 00:44:27,200
Show yourself, demon!

568
00:44:28,119 --> 00:44:29,404
There's nowhere to run.

569
00:44:29,439 --> 00:44:32,301
The thrill is in the chase,
never in the capture.

570
00:44:32,336 --> 00:44:36,939
Oh, my God!
If anyone can solve this, it's you.
