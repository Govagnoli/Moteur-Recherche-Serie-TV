BIG BAND MUSIC PLAYS

2
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:12,080
Two minutes to curtain up, c'mon!

3
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:13,720
Two minutes to curtain up.

4
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:16,000
Where's Tallulah?
Where do you think?

5
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:19,040
Hey, Tallulah, leave him alone!

6
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:27,520
It's nearly Showtime, Laszlo -
I gotta go.

7
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:31,440
Promise you'll come on Sunday.
My mother will kill me
if she doesn't get to meet you.

8
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:33,360
What if she doesn't like me?

9
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:37,360
Tallulah, she'll love you
just as much as I do.

10
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:40,720
Aw, you say the sweetest things!

11
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:44,480
But it's true. Now promise me,
Sunday - you'll come?

12
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:47,200
I promise. Cross my heart.

13
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:51,400
Here - take this, sweetheart.

14
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:53,280
Wear it on stage and think of me.

15
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:57,360
Tallulah!
I'm coming! Quit Yelling!

16
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:01,000
How do I look?

17
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:07,360
Like an angel.

18
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,400
Wish me luck, Laszlo!

19
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:22,120
Break a leg, sweetheart.

20
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:29,320
Tallulah?

21
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:42,000
Who's there?

22
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:53,440
Hello?

23
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,080
Hello?

24
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:00,880
LOW GRUNTING

25
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,680
DOOR SLAMS

26
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:17,720
Who's there?

27
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,400
Who are you?

28
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:35,160
GRUNTING AND SQUEALING

29
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:26,800
Where are we?
Ahh, smell that Atlantic breeze.

30
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,480
Nice and cold, lovely!

31
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,960
Martha, have you met my friend?

32
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,320
Is that...?

33
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:35,080
Oh, my God,
that's the Statue of liberty!

34
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:37,040
Gateway to the New World.

35
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:42,920
"Give me your tired,
your poor, your huddled masses
yearning to breathe free."

36
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:46,800
That's so brilliant. I've
always wanted to go to New York...

37
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:50,200
I mean, the real New York,
not the New New New New New one.

38
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,200
Well, there's the genuine article.

39
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:56,440
So good they named it twice.
Mind you, it was New Amsterdam,
originally.

40
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:58,720
Harder to say twice -
no wonder it didn't catch on...

41
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,480
New Amsterdam, NewAmsterdam.

42
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:05,400
Wonder what year it is? Cos look,
the Empire State Building, it's not
even finished yet. Work in progress.

43
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:10,640
They've still got a couple of floors
to go, and if I know my history that
makes the date somewhere around...

44
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:13,080
November 1st 1930.

45
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,720
You're getting good at this.

46
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:17,120
Nearly 80 years ago.

47
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:22,240
It's funny, cos you see those old
newsreels, all in black and white,
like it's so far away.

48
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,840
But here we are.

49
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:26,000
It's real. It's now.

50
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,600
C'mon then, you!
Where do you wanna go first?

51
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,680
I think our detour just got longer.

52
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:35,920
"Hooverville Mystery Deepens".
What's Hooverville?

53
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:38,880
# If you're blue and
you don't know where to go to... #

54
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:42,840
Herbert Hoover, 31st President of
the USA, came to power a year ago.

55
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:45,240
Up till then, New York was a
boomtown, the roaring Twenties.

56
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:47,080
And then...
The Wall Street Crash, yeah?

57
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:50,400
When was that, 1929? Yup. The
whole economy wiped out overnight.

58
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,880
Thousands of people unemployed.

59
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:55,200
All of a sudden, the huddled masses
doubled in number, with nowhere to go.

60
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:57,520
So they ended up here
in Central Park.

61
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:00,160
What, they actually live
in the Park?

62
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,760
In the middle of the city?

63
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:12,960
0rdinary people...

64
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:14,960
Lost their jobs,

65
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:17,280
couldn't pay the rent...
they lost everything.

66
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:24,480
There are places like this all over
America, and no-one's helping them.

67
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,920
You only come to Hooverville
when there's no where else to go.

68
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:31,400
You thieving low life!

69
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:36,640
All morning I wait in the bread line
for a single loaf. I didn't touch it.

70
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:42,320
Cut that out! Cut it out, right now!

71
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:46,440
He stole my bread! That's enough!

72
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:48,280
Did you take it?

73
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,280
I don't know what happened.
He just went crazy.

74
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,600
That's enough!

75
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:59,600
Now, think real careful
before you lie to me.

76
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:02,200
I'm starving, Solomon.

77
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,320
We all starving.

78
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:14,080
And we all got family somewhere.

79
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:20,200
No stealing and no fighting.
You know the rules.

80
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:25,640
Thirteen years ago, I fought
in the Great War, a lot of us did.

81
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:31,080
And the only reason we got through
was because we stuck together.

82
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:36,920
No matter how bad things get,
we still act like human beings.

83
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:39,520
It's all we've got.

84
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:44,120
Come on.

85
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:47,840
I suppose that makes you
the boss around here?

86
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:54,160
And, er, who might you be?
He's the Doctor, I'm Martha.

87
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,040
A doctor?

88
00:06:56,040 --> 00:07:00,480
Well, we got stockbrokers,

89
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:03,960
we've got a lawyer,
but you're the first doctor.

90
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:06,520
The neighbourhood gets classier
by the day.

91
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:12,240
How many people live here?
Any one time... hundreds.

92
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:16,680
No place else to go. But I will
say this about Hooverville -
we're a truly equal society.

93
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:21,360
Black, white,
all the same, all starving.

94
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:25,160
So you're welcome, both of you.

95
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:30,600
But tell me, Doctor, you're a man of
learning, right? Explain this to me,

96
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:36,440
that there is going to be the
tallest building in the world.

97
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:39,440
How come they can do that

98
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:43,520
and we've got people starving
in the heart of Manhattan?

99
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,080
Hoist!

100
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:59,440
I'm telling ya,
the men won't stand for it.

101
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,480
I mean, are you out of your mind?

102
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:06,560
I got 500 men working seven
days a week. They're flat out.
And you want us to go faster?!

103
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:09,480
The new masters demand it.

104
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:14,040
But we're on schedule,
what's the problem? Another month
and we'll be done.

105
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:18,520
The mast on this building needs
extra work, completed by tonight.

106
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:21,280
Tonight? No way! It's impossible.

107
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,360
That's an order. Yeah?

108
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:27,680
Well, one word from me, and
every man on this site stops work.

109
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:30,440
So go on! Tell your masters that!

110
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:34,440
If that's your attitude, I think
you should tell them yourself.

111
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:38,920
Yeah? Well, I ain't afraid
of no man in a suit.

112
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:41,680
So these new bosses,
what's their names?

113
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:45,800
I think you could say they're
from out of town. Italians?

114
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,680
Bit further than that.

115
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,680
How much further?

116
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:52,000
Beyond your imagination.

117
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,280
What's that supposed to mean?
Who are they?

118
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:57,880
Mr Diagoras, who are we working for?

119
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,280
Behold your masters.

120
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,560
What the hell?

121
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,480
I have been summoned. Explain.

122
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,920
Explain!

123
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:29,840
It can talk. How does it talk?!

124
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:33,600
And what the hell are they?!
You've gotta be kidding me!

125
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:38,040
I'm sorry, my lord. But this man
is refusing to complete the work.

126
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,800
Then we must replace him.

127
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:44,000
Is anybody gonna tell me what the
hell is happening here?! Use him!

128
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,520
Take him for the Final Experiment.

129
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:48,600
What's going on? Let go!

130
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:52,560
Let go of me, let go of me!
Get off me!

131
00:09:56,840 --> 00:10:01,760
The Empire State Building
must be completed in time.

132
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:05,120
It will be, trust me.

133
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:08,000
Labour is cheap,
and that man can be replaced.

134
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,600
The plan must not fail.

135
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:13,680
We calculate the Gamma strike
has accelerated.

136
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,480
We need more bodies. Immediately!

137
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,200
Yes, master.

138
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:27,920
So, men going missing. Is this true?

139
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:32,160
It's true all right.

140
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:37,400
But what does "missing" mean?

141
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:43,000
People must come and go here
all the time. It's not like anyone
keeps a register. Come on in.

142
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:46,320
This is different.

143
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:50,280
In what way? Someone takes them.

144
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,440
At night.

145
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,720
We hear something,
someone calls out for help.

146
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,640
By the time we get there,
they're gone.

147
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,600
Like they've vanished into thin air.

148
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,840
And you're sure
someone's taking them?

149
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:05,640
Doctor, when you've got next to nothing,
you hold on to the little you got.

150
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,840
A knife, a blanket.
You take it with you.

151
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:13,000
You don't leave bread uneaten,
a fire still burning. Have you been
to the police?

152
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:17,520
Yeah, we tried that, another
deadbeat goes missing, big deal.

153
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:21,880
So the question is...
who's taking them, and what for?

154
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:24,200
Solomon! Mr Diagoras is here.

155
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:31,480
I need men. Volunteers.
I've got a little work for you.

156
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:33,640
And you sure look like
you could use the money.

157
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,280
What is the money? A dollar a day.

158
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:38,600
What's the work?

159
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,760
A little trip down the sewers.

160
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:45,840
Got a tunnel collapsed, needs
clearing and fixing. Any takers?

161
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:48,520
A dollar a day is a slave wage.

162
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:53,520
And men don't always come back up,
do they? Accidents happen.

163
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:55,440
What sort of accidents?

164
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:58,840
You don't need the work, that's fine.
Anybody else?

165
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,000
Enough with the questions.

166
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,960
Ah, no, no, no. I'm volunteering.

167
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,720
I'll go.

168
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,760
I'll kill you for this.

169
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:08,520
Anybody else?

170
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:17,560
Turn left, go about half a mile,
follow tunnel 273.

171
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:22,120
The fall's right ahead of you,
you can't miss it.
When do we get our dollar?

172
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:24,800
When you come back up.
And if we don't come back up?

173
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:26,680
Then I got no-one to pay.

174
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:29,040
Don't worry, we'll be back.

175
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,080
Let's hope so.

176
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:36,120
Just gotta stick together.

177
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:40,480
Easy to get lost.
It's like a huge rabbit warren.

178
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,280
Could hide an army down here.

179
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:47,240
So what about you, Frank?

180
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:51,200
You're not from around these parts,
are you? You can talk!

181
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:53,720
No, I'm Tennessee born and bred.

182
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:55,360
So how come you're here?

183
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:57,840
Oh, my Daddy died...

184
00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:02,800
Momma couldn't afford to feed
us all, so I'm the oldest -
up to me to feed myself.

185
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,600
So I put on my coat,
hitched up here on the railroads.

186
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:08,240
There's a whole lot of
runaways in the camp,

187
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:12,640
younger than me, from all over -
Missouri, Oklahoma, Texas.

188
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:16,360
Solomon keeps a look out for us.

189
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:18,440
So, what about you?

190
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:20,800
You're a long way from home.

191
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:24,080
Yeah. I'm just a hitcher too.

192
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,840
You stick with me,
you'll be all right.

193
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:28,760
This Diagoras bloke, who is he?

194
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:35,520
Couple of months ago, he was just
another foreman. Now seems like
he's running most of Manhattan.

195
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:37,480
How'd he manage that, then?

196
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:39,920
These are strange times.

197
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:45,360
A man can go from being the king of
the hill to the lowest of the low
overnight.

198
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:49,960
Guess for some folks
it works the other way round. Whoa!

199
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:52,240
Is it radioactive or something?

200
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,320
It's gone off, whatever it is.

201
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:04,880
And you've got to pick it up.

202
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Shine your torch through it.

203
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,080
Composite organic matter.

204
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:16,640
Martha, medical opinion?

205
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:18,680
It's not human, I know that.

206
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:20,760
No.

207
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:22,520
It's not.

208
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:25,240
And I'll tell you something else.

209
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:29,440
We must be at least
half a mile in. I don't see
any signs of a collapse, do you?

210
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:32,480
So why did Mr Diagoras
send us down here?

211
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,360
Where are we now, what's up above?

212
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:37,840
Well, we're right underneath
Manhattan.

213
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:51,400
And here, the crowning glory
of the Empire State Building,
the mast itself.

214
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:55,200
1,472 feet above New York.

215
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,800
It's a beautiful thing, sir.

216
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:59,280
And every single one of us
is proud of it.

217
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:03,400
My wife says it's like a spire
reaching into heaven.

218
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:06,840
Except the gates of heaven
need a little decoration.

219
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:15,000
These plates
have gotta be fixed to the mast,
right to the base itself.

220
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,000
That's Ok.
That shouldn't take too long.

221
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,680
But the work
has gotta be finished tonight.

222
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,520
Are you trying to kill us?!

223
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:25,800
Don't argue with me!

224
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:29,560
But sir, the men can't work up
there at night. It's freezing.

225
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:31,840
Your hands go numb,
you lose your grip, you fall.

226
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:33,360
You don't get it.

227
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:39,800
If you won't work,

228
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:41,800
I can replace you like that.

229
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:48,360
Now, take those panels,

230
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:50,320
and get going!

231
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:01,520
What sort of metal is this, anyway?

232
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:03,440
Don't ask questions. Just go.

233
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:21,880
I don't care how cold it is,
how tired you are, just
get out there and finish the job!

234
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:33,120
The conductor must be complete
for our plan to succeed.

235
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,600
Unemployment is such an incentive.

236
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:38,320
It'll get done, don't worry.

237
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:41,760
Daleks have no concept of worry.

238
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:43,640
Yeah?

239
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,800
Well, lucky you.

240
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:48,680
This day is ending.

241
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:53,480
Humankind is weak,
you shelter from the dark.

242
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:59,400
And yet, you have built all this.

243
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:05,240
That's progress. Gotta move with
the times or you get left behind.

244
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:08,240
My planet is gone.

245
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:11,920
Destroyed in a great war.

246
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:16,520
Yet versions of this city
stand throughout history.

247
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:21,280
The human race always continues.

248
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:23,040
We've had wars.

249
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:26,200
I've been a soldier myself.

250
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:30,320
And I swore then I'd survive,
no matter what.

251
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:33,600
You have rare ambition.

252
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,880
Oh, I want to run this city,
whatever it takes...

253
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:42,000
by any means necessary.

254
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,200
You think like a Dalek.

255
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:48,280
I'll take that as a compliment.

256
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:56,120
This human is our best option.

257
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:58,320
Bring him to me.

258
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:03,160
Your loyalty will be rewarded.
Come with me.

259
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:13,560
Prepare the laboratory.
The Final Experiment will begin!

260
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:15,240
We obey.

261
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:33,920
Where are we going? You have been
summoned by our leader.

262
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:37,000
Oh, and about time too!

263
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:27,040
I bring you the human.
I take it... you're in charge?

264
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:30,440
Correct. I am Dalek Sec.

265
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:33,560
Leader of the Cult of Skaro.

266
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:42,440
Then, my lord Sec, I am honoured
to meet you. Ever since you
first made contact with me...

267
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:48,520
transmitting your thoughts into the
corners of my mind, tempting me
with such images, such ideas,

268
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:53,520
oh sir, I'd always dreamed
that together... Cease talking.

269
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:58,280
I just wanna let you know
how grateful I am. I said cease!

270
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:01,680
Slaves! Secure the human. But...

271
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:04,280
you don't need to do that,
I'm on your side.

272
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:05,840
I'm working with you.

273
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:08,760
I'm your partner! I'm your friend!

274
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:12,320
We're way beyond half a mile.

275
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,280
There's no collapse, nothing.

276
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:16,440
That Diagoras bloke, was he lying?

277
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:19,520
Looks like it. So why did
he want people to come down here?

278
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:23,640
Solomon, take these two back.
I'll be much quicker on my own.

279
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:28,320
SQUEALING
What the hell was that? Hello?

280
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:31,000
Ssh! What if it's one
of the folk gone missing?

281
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,440
You'd be scared half mad
down here on your own.

282
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:38,680
You think they're still alive?
Heck, we ain't seen no bodies down
here. Maybe they just got lost.

283
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:40,440
MORE SQUEALS

284
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:44,440
I never heard nobody
make a sound like that.
Where's it's coming from?

285
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:50,960
It sounds like
there's more than one of them.

286
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:52,480
This way? No, that way.

287
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:58,240
Doctor...

288
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:09,000
Who are you? Are you lost?

289
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Can you understand me?

290
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:17,040
I've been thinking about folk
lost down here.

291
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:21,360
It's all right, Frank,
just stay back. Let me have a look.

292
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:26,440
He's got a point, though,
my mate Frank.

293
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:30,360
I would hate to be stuck
down here all on my own.

294
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:33,080
But we know the way out,

295
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:36,400
daylight, if you come with us...

296
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:42,640
Oh, but what are you?

297
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,720
Is that...

298
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,680
some kinda carnival mask?

299
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,840
No, it's real.

300
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:56,120
I'm sorry. But listen to me.

301
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:58,960
I promise I can help.

302
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,960
Who did this to you?

303
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:03,280
Doctor...

304
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:06,000
I think you'd better get back here.

305
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,120
Doctor!

306
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:09,760
Actually...

307
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:11,640
good point.

308
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:16,800
They're following you...
Yeah, I noticed that, thanks.

309
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,320
Right then... Martha.

310
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:20,800
Frank. Solomon. What?

311
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:23,360
I think, um...

312
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:26,440
Basically... RUN!

313
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:39,120
Where are we going? This way!

314
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:49,680
There's a ladder! Come on!

315
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:59,000
THEY SQUEAL

316
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,160
Frank!

317
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:06,120
THEY GRUNT

318
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:10,760
THEY SQUEAL

319
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:13,160
Come on, Frank. Come on...

320
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:19,680
I've got you. Come on!
Come on! Come on!

321
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:25,200
Frank! N0-0-0-0!

322
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,240
Come on!

323
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:30,640
We can't go after him. I've got to
go back down! We can't leave him!

324
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:34,480
No! I'm not losing anybody else!
Those creatures were from Hell!

325
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:38,000
From Hell itself! If we go after
him, they'll take us all!

326
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,640
There's nothing we can do.

327
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:41,640
I'm sorry.

328
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,960
All right then, put 'em up!

329
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:50,000
Hands in the air!
And no funny business.

330
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,360
Now tell me, you shmucks.

331
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:56,640
What have you done with Laszlo?

332
00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:00,680
Who's Laszlo? Laszlo's my boyfriend.

333
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:03,920
WAS my boyfriend.
Until he disappeared, two weeks ago.

334
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:05,840
No letter, no goodbye, no nothing.

335
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:10,760
And I'm not stupid, I know some guys
are just pigs, but not my Laszlo.

336
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:14,120
I mean, what kind of guy asks you to
meet his mom before he vamooses?

337
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:16,840
It might just help if you
put that down...

338
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:18,720
Huh?

339
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,160
Oh, sure.

340
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:24,320
Oh, c'mon, it's not real,
it's just a prop...

341
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:27,680
it was either that or a spear. What
do you think happened to Laszlo?

342
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:29,280
I wish I knew.

343
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:32,480
0ne minute he's there, the next -
zip - vanished.

344
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,720
Listen, em, what was your name?

345
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:37,800
Tallulah. Tallulah.
Three I's and an h. Right.

346
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:40,960
Um, we can try and find Laszlo...
but he's not the only one.

347
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:44,840
There are people disappearing every
night. And there are creatures.

348
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:47,520
Such creatures...

349
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:49,520
Whaddya mean, creatures?

350
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:52,960
Look, listen, just trust me.
Everyone is in danger.

351
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:55,720
I need to find out
exactly what THIS is.

352
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:58,440
Because then, I'll know
exactly what we're fighting.

353
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:00,640
Yay.

354
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:11,720
How 'bout this? Found it backstage.

355
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:14,120
Perfect. It's the capacitors I need.

356
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:17,760
I'm just rigging up a crude
little DNA scan, for this beastie.

357
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:20,800
If I can get a chromosomal reading,
I can find out where it's from.

358
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:22,600
How about you, Doctor?

359
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:24,160
Where are you from?

360
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:27,680
I been all over, I never
heard anybody talk like you.

361
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:30,480
Just exactly who are you?

362
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:32,560
Oh, I'm just, sort of, passing by.

363
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:35,440
I'm not a fool, Doctor.

364
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:37,720
No.

365
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:39,240
Sorry.

366
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:50,280
I was scared, Doctor.

367
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:53,040
I let 'em take Frank cos...

368
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:54,960
I was just so scared.

369
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:00,600
I got to get back to Hooverville.

370
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:03,320
With those creatures on the loose,
we gotta protect ourselves.

371
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:05,360
Cos no-one else is gonna help us.
Good luck.

372
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:09,840
I hope you find what
you're looking for,

373
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:12,240
for all our sakes.

374
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:16,960
Laszlo...

375
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:22,000
he'd wait for me after the show,
walk me home, like I was a lady...

376
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,480
He'd leave a flower for
me on my dressing table.

377
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,400
Every day, just a single rosebud.

378
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:29,040
Haven't you reported him missing?

379
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:34,320
Sure, but he's just a
stage hand, who cares?
The management certainly don't.

380
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:37,720
Can't you kick up a fuss or
something? Ok, so then they fire me!

381
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:41,520
But they'd listen to Y0U,
you're one of the stars!

382
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:44,400
Oh, honey, I got one song, in a
back street revue,

383
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:47,400
and that's only cos
Heidi Chicane broke her ankle,

384
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:50,480
which had nothing to do with
me, whatever anybody says.

385
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:52,080
I can't afford to make a fuss!

386
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:53,840
If I don't make this month's rent,

387
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:56,200
then before you know it,
I'm in Hooverville.

388
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:57,960
OK, I get it.

389
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:00,080
It's the Depression, sweetie.

390
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:05,440
Your heart might break,
but the show goes on, because
if it stops, you starve.

391
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:13,000
Every night I have to go out there,
sing, dance, keep going,
hoping he's gonna to come back.

392
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:16,440
I'm sorry...

393
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:20,680
Hey, you're lucky, though.

394
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:22,840
You got yourself a
forward-thinking guy

395
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:26,200
with that hot potato in the
sharp suit. Oh, he's not...

396
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:27,760
We're not together.

397
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:31,800
Oh, sure you are! I've seen the
way you look at him. It's obvious!

398
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:33,120
Not to him.

399
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:39,280
Oh, I shoulda realised.
He's into musical theatre, huh?

400
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:43,640
What a waste! N... n...
Still, ya gotta live in hope.

401
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:46,280
It's the only thing
that's kept me going, cos...

402
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:48,840
well, look.

403
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:52,200
0n my dressing table.
Every day still...

404
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:55,200
You think it's Laszlo? I don't know.

405
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:57,680
If he's still around,
why is he being all secret,

406
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:59,480
like he doesn't want me to see him?

407
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,360
The stories are true.

408
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:06,800
People ARE being taken.

409
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:09,320
We lost Frank today.

410
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:12,200
He was stolen from
right in front of me,

411
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:14,720
but no more!
I swear to you, no more!

412
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:19,680
Now I made a pledge, that this
place would be a peaceful place.

413
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:22,360
But now it's time to take up arms.

414
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:23,760
All: Yeah!

415
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:26,760
We need weapons.
We need sentries on duty. Yeah!

416
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:28,840
We need men prepared to fight.

417
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:33,400
We got to protect ourselves,
cos you know no-one else will.

418
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:37,080
Now get moving!
Arm yourselves, come on!

419
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:53,920
I can't feel my fingers!

420
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:55,640

DRILLING

422
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:05,520
We can't stay here for much longer.
We'll fall. C'mon, we're nearly done.

423
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:11,120
DRILLING

424
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,800
The chromatin solution is ready.

425
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:20,200
Then our preparations are complete.

426
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:22,720
What are you doing?
Preparations for what?

427
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:26,080
This is the Final Experiment.

428
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:27,960
What do you mean?

429
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:30,400
D'you mean like these Pigmen things?

430
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:34,000
You're not gonna turn me into one
of those, oh God, please don't...

431
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,400
The Pig Slaves are primitive.

432
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:40,600
The Final Experiment is greater
by far.

433
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:44,440
But how does that involve me?

434
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:47,640
We need your flesh.

435
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:49,600
Bring him to me.

436
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:52,160
Halt!

437
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:55,400
This action contradicts the
Dalek imperative.

438
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:58,640
Daleks are supreme. Humans are weak.

439
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:04,240
But there are millions of humans,
and only four of us.

440
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:08,640
If we are supreme,
why are we not victorious?

441
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:17,240
The Cult of Skaro was created by
the Emperor, for this very purpose.

442
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:20,720
To imagine new ways of survival.

443
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:23,560
But we must remain pure.

444
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:25,480
No, Dalek Thay!

445
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:29,640
0ur purity has brought
us to extinction!

446
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:33,200
We must adapt to survive.

447
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:36,840
You have all made sacrifices...

448
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:41,520
And now, I will sacrifice myself.

449
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:43,480
For the greater cause.

450
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:49,880
For the future of Dalek-kind.
Now bring me the human!

451
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:53,400
But I don't understand!
What do you mean? Get offa me!

452
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:57,520
Behold. The true Dalek form.

453
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:06,400
Now. Join with me.

454
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:11,520
No... Get off me... I've done
everything you asked me...

455
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:12,560
N0!

456
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:30,320

to heat you up...

Martha!

514
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:37,720
You're alive! Oh...

515
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:42,200
We thought we'd lost you.

516
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:46,000
SQUEALING
All right, all right, we're moving!

517
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,600
Where are they taking us?

518
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:50,120
I don't know. But we can find
out what's going on down here...

519
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:56,680
When you say, "THEY've taken
her", who's "they", exactly?

520
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:59,000
And who are you anyway?

521
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:02,280
I never asked. Shhh. OK, OK... Shhhh!

522
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,080
I mean, you're a handsome enough...

523
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:30,840
No, no, no, no, no, no, no...

524
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:38,720
They survive. They always
survive, while I lose everything.

525
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:41,360
That metal thing...

526
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:43,320
What was it?

527
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:47,280
It's called a Dalek.

528
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:49,160
And it's not just metal. It's alive.

529
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:53,440
You're kidding me!
Do I look like I'm kidding?

530
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:58,560
Inside that shell, there's
a creature, born to hate,

531
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:03,080
who's only thought is to destroy
everything and everyone
that isn't a Dalek too.

532
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:08,440
It won't stop until it's
killed every human being alive.

533
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:13,440
But... if that's not a human
being, that kinda implies...

534
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:15,360
it's from outer space.

535
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:19,760
Yet again, that's a
no with the kidding.

536
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:23,440
0i... But what's it doing here?

537
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:25,120
In New York?

538
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:29,480
Stop the process!

539
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:31,600
Dalek Sec is failing!

540
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:37,520
No! The experiment must continue!

541
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:41,200
Administer the solution!

542
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:48,360
We must evolve... Evolve! Evolve!

543
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:53,120
Every second you're here you're in
danger, I'm taking you back now.
SHE SCREAMS

544
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:56,000
Where's Martha? What have you
done with her?

545
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:59,920
What have you done with Martha?
I didn't take her.

546
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:02,480
Can you remember your name?

547
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:04,120
Don't... Iook at me.

548
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:09,560
Do you know where she is?
Stay back! Don't look at me.

549
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:11,200
What happened to you?

550
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:13,800
They made me a monster. Who did?

551
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:17,280
The Masters. The Daleks. Why?

552
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:19,480
They needed slaves.

553
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:26,040
They needed slaves to steal more
people. So they created us.

554
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:29,120
Part animal, part human.

555
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:31,240
I escaped before they got my mind...

556
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:34,360
but it was still too late.

557
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:36,000
Do you know what happened to Martha?

558
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:40,760
They took her.

559
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:43,160
It's my fault, she was following me.

560
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:45,400
Were you in the theatre?

561
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:46,960
I never...

562
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:50,040
Yes... Why?

563
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:53,840
Why were you there? I never
wanted you to see me like this.

564
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:55,400
Why me?

565
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:58,120
What have I got to do with this?

566
00:38:58,120 --> 00:39:00,720
Were you following me?
Is that why you were there?

567
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:05,800
Yes.

568
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:10,560
Who are you?

569
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:13,040
I was lonely.

570
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:14,920
Who are you?

571
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:16,560
I needed to see you.

572
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:19,520
Who... are you?

573
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:21,680
I'm sorry.

574
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:23,160
No, wait.

575
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:26,840
Let me look at you.

576
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:41,640
Laszlo? My Laszlo?

577
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:44,960
What have they done to you?

578
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:48,760
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry...

579
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:52,880
Laszlo. Can you show me
where they are?

580
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:56,480
But they'll kill you. If I don't
stop them, they'll kill everyone.

581
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:04,600
Then follow me.

582
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:09,800
What are they keeping us here for?

583
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:13,000
I dunno. Got a nasty feeling
we're being kept in the larder.

584
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:16,280
GRUNTING

585
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:23,520
What are they doing? What's wrong?
Silence! Silence!

586
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:26,320
What the hell is that?

587
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:35,440
You will form a line! Move! Move!!
Just do what it says, everyone, OK?
Just... obey.

588
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:39,680
The female is wise. 0bey!

589
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:41,240
Report!

590
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:46,280
These are strong specimens.
They will help the Dalek cause.

591
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:50,640
Dalek... What is the status of
the Final Experiment??

592
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:56,480
The Dalekenium is in place. The
Energy Conductor is now complete.

593
00:40:56,480 --> 00:41:00,200
Then I will extract
prisoners for selection!

594
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:04,640
Intelligence scan - initiate!

595
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:09,400
Reading brain waves.

596
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:11,160
Low intelligence.

597
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:12,960
You callin' me stupid? Silence!

598
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:16,000
This one will become a Pig Slave.

599
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,640
Next. No! Let go of me!

600
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:20,800
I'm not becoming one of them,

601
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:24,600
let me go! Intelligence scan -
initiate!

602
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:27,760
They're divided into two groups.

603
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:30,480
High intelligence
and low intelligence.

604
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:32,240
The low intelligence are taken,

605
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:36,000
to become Pig Slaves, like
me. That's not fair! Sh!

606
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:39,280
You're the smartest guy I ever dated!

607
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:42,120
And the others? They are taken to
the laboratory.

608
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:43,800
But why? What for?

609
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:49,560
I don't know. The Masters
only call it the Final Experiment.

610
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:53,000
Superior intelligence.

611
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:57,480
Intelligence scan - initiate.

612
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:00,720
Superior intelligence.

613
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:05,280
This one will become part
of the Final Experiment.

614
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:08,880
You can't just experiment on people,
it's insane, it's inhuman.

615
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:11,280
We are not human.

616
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:18,760
Prisoners of high intelligence
will be taken to the Transgenic
Laboratory.

617
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:21,760
Look out, they're moving.

618
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:27,880
Doctor. Doctor, quickly. I'm not
coming, I've got an idea... You go.

619
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:30,680
Laszlo, come on.
Can you remember the way?

620
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:32,440
Yeah, I think so. Then go, please.

621
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:35,600
But Laszlo you've got to come
with me. Where would I go?

622
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:39,680
Tallulah, I'm begging you. Save
yourself. Just run! Just go!

623
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:42,760
Go.

624
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:56,520
Keep walking.
I am so glad to see you!

625
00:42:56,520 --> 00:43:01,040
Yeah, well you can kiss me later.
You too, Frank, if you want.

626
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:17,480
SHE SOBS

627
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:37,160
report!

628
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:42,160
Dalek Sec is entering the
final stage of evolution.

629
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:46,400
Scan him!
Prepare for birth! Evolution?

630
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:49,840
What's wrong with old Charlie Boy
over there? Ask them.

631
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:53,040
What, me? Don't be daft.

632
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:56,440
I don't exactly want to get noticed.
Ask them what's going on.

633
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:03,440
Daleks. I demand to be told.

634
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:07,240
What is this... Final Experiment?

635
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:09,240
Report!

636
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:13,760
You will bear witness. To what?

637
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:17,680
This is the dawn of a new age.

638
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:20,200
What does that mean?

639
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:24,560
We are the only four
Daleks in existence.

640
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:27,240
So the species must evolve.

641
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:29,920
A life outside the shell.

642
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:34,040
The children of Skaro
must walk again.

643
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:06,880
What is it?

644
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:24,040
I... am a Human Dalek.

645
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:28,960
I... am your future.

Move, move, move, move move!
Come on, everyone up, come on!

648
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:27,480
The Daleks are bad enough at any
time, but right now they're
vulnerable!

649
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:29,760
That makes them more
dangerous than ever!

650
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:31,360
SHOUTING

651
00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:32,800
It's started!

652
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:35,080
Got to get everyone out.

653
00:46:35,080 --> 00:46:38,600
Hooverville's the lowest
place a man can fall, there's
nowhere else to go.

654
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:39,960
Oh, my God.

655
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:41,000
Take aim...

656
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:48,440
EXTERMINATE!
