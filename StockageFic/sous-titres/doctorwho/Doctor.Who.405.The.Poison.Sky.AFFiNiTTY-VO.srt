1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,693
Doctor, it's Martha.
And I'm bringing you back to Earth.

2
00:00:04,728 --> 00:00:07,686
52 deaths at the exact same moment,
worldwide.

3
00:00:07,721 --> 00:00:10,860
All inside their cars.
They were all fitted with ATMOS.

4
00:00:10,895 --> 00:00:13,965
ATMOS can be threaded through
any and every make of car.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,361
Get back! Then they've got
poisonous gas in every car on earth.

6
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:22,161
Sontaran! General Staal
of the tenth Sontaran fleet.

7
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:28,520
And this is Ross.
Good afternoon, sir.

8
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:32,726
What is that?

9
00:00:32,761 --> 00:00:35,966
Soon, THAT will be you.

10
00:00:36,001 --> 00:00:39,560
Now we begin. Martha, tell
Colonel Mace it's the Sontarans.

11
00:00:39,595 --> 00:00:42,126
Code Red Sontaran.
If they're in the factory

12
00:00:42,161 --> 00:00:44,801
tell him not to start shooting,
UNIT will get massacred.

13
00:00:44,836 --> 00:00:46,446
Code Red Sontaran. Gotcha.

14
00:00:46,481 --> 00:00:48,800
Found anything yet?
Nothing to report.

15
00:00:48,835 --> 00:00:51,366
Prepare the subjugation of Earth!

16
00:00:51,401 --> 00:00:54,520
Sontar-ha! Sontar-ha! Sontar-ha!
Sontar-ha!

17
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,760
Doctor!

18
00:01:22,555 --> 00:01:25,062

22
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:40,360
He's gonna choke! Doctor!

23
00:01:42,041 --> 00:01:43,801
It won't open!

24
00:01:48,721 --> 00:01:51,320
Well, don't just stand there!

25
00:01:51,355 --> 00:01:53,486
Get him out!

26
00:01:53,521 --> 00:01:55,605
All soldiers to a door!

27
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:58,121
Take positions on the ground floor.

28
00:01:58,156 --> 00:01:59,685
Wicowsky!

29
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:02,720
Take the soldiers into the factory!
Make the area secure!

30
00:02:02,755 --> 00:02:04,205
Seal off doors and windows!

31
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,401
We've tried everything,
it won't stop.

32
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,165
What have we got?
ATMOS is running wild, sir.

33
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:15,241
It can't be stopped,
it's everywhere. The whole planet.

34
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:35,805
Thanks!

35
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:38,220
I can't believe you've got an axe!
Burglars?

36
00:02:38,255 --> 00:02:40,565
Get inside, try to close off
doors and windows.

37
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:43,561
Doctor! This is all I could
find but it hasn't got ATMOS.

38
00:02:43,596 --> 00:02:45,246
Donna, you coming? Yeah.

39
00:02:45,281 --> 00:02:45,361
Don't go. Look what happens
every time that Doctor appears.

40
00:02:45,396 --> 00:02:48,601
Stay with us, please.
You go, my darlin'. Dad!

41
00:02:52,321 --> 00:02:54,181
Don't listen to her.

42
00:02:54,216 --> 00:02:56,041
You go with The Doctor.

43
00:02:56,076 --> 00:02:58,160
That's my girl!

44
00:02:59,921 --> 00:03:01,280
Bye.

45
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:44,100
Success. The Operative has
the necessary information.

46
00:03:44,135 --> 00:03:47,120
Good work, for a female.
Now she must be protected.

47
00:03:47,155 --> 00:03:48,881
I will prepare an attack squad.

48
00:03:50,441 --> 00:03:52,980
This is it, isn't it?

49
00:03:53,015 --> 00:03:55,485
Oh, man. This is war!

50
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,161
And how does it feel, boy?

51
00:03:57,196 --> 00:03:58,721
Magnificent!

52
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:03,060
The government has declared
a state of emergency.

53
00:04:03,095 --> 00:04:05,921
People are being told to stay away
from all cars

54
00:04:05,956 --> 00:04:08,098
with ATMOS devices attached.

55
00:04:08,133 --> 00:04:10,206
The gas appears to be toxic.

56
00:04:10,241 --> 00:04:14,000
We're warning anyone and everyone,
stay away from the cars.

57
00:04:14,035 --> 00:04:16,481
Repeat, stay away from your cars.

58
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,880
Ross, look after yourself.
Get inside the building! Will do.

59
00:04:25,915 --> 00:04:27,885
Greyhound 40 to Trap One.

60
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:30,161
I've just returned The Doctor
to base, over.

61
00:04:30,196 --> 00:04:32,638
Trap One, received. Over.

62
00:04:32,673 --> 00:04:35,317
Sir! Message from The Doctor.

63
00:04:35,352 --> 00:04:37,926
He says Code Red Sontaran.

64
00:04:37,961 --> 00:04:42,440
All troops. Code Red Sontaran.
Code Red Sontaran.

65
00:04:42,475 --> 00:04:43,725
The air is disgusting.

66
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:46,280
It's not so bad for me.
Get inside the TARDIS. Oh!

67
00:04:46,315 --> 00:04:47,965
I've never given you a key.

68
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,526
That's yours.
Quite a big moment, really.

69
00:04:50,561 --> 00:04:54,161
Maybe we can get sentimental after
the world's choked to death.

70
00:04:54,196 --> 00:04:56,640
Good idea! Where are you going?

71
00:04:56,675 --> 00:04:58,321
To stop a war!

72
00:05:14,881 --> 00:05:19,040
Here I am! Whatever you do,
Colonel Mace, do not engage
the Sontarans in battle.

73
00:05:19,075 --> 00:05:22,125
There is nothing they like better
than a war! Leave this to me.

74
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:26,480
And what are you going to do?
I've got the TARDIS, I'm gonna
get on board their ship.

75
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:33,320
Come on.

76
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,321
Ready for transport.

77
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:14,325
The spoils of war.

78
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:18,926
The Doctor's infamous vessel
in Sontaran hands.

79
00:06:18,961 --> 00:06:22,280
It's time I made a move, sir.
I have soldiers of my own.

80
00:06:22,315 --> 00:06:25,160
I'll tell them of the honour
and the glory, sir.

81
00:06:25,195 --> 00:06:27,840
I'll tell them that Planetfall
is coming!

82
00:06:30,881 --> 00:06:33,686
He is behaving exactly
as predicted, sir.

83
00:06:33,721 --> 00:06:37,361
None of the humans can
guess our true purpose.

84
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:42,685
But...

85
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,161
where's the Tardis? Taste that,

86
00:06:45,196 --> 00:06:47,205
in the air. Yecch.

87
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:50,161
That sort of metal tang.

88
00:06:50,196 --> 00:06:53,166
Teleport exchange.

89
00:06:53,201 --> 00:06:55,760
It's the Sontarans,
they've taken it.

90
00:06:56,761 --> 00:06:58,446
I'm stuck.

91
00:06:58,481 --> 00:07:00,725
On Earth, like...

92
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:03,961
Like an ordinary person.
Like a Human! How rubbish is that!

93
00:07:03,996 --> 00:07:06,041
Sorry, no offence, but come on!

94
00:07:06,076 --> 00:07:09,006
So, what do we do? Well...

95
00:07:09,041 --> 00:07:11,520
It's shielded,
they could never detect it.

96
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:17,441
What? I'm just wondering.
Have you phoned your family and Tom?

97
00:07:17,476 --> 00:07:21,258
No, what for? The gas.

98
00:07:21,293 --> 00:07:25,040
Tell them to stay inside.

99
00:07:25,075 --> 00:07:27,157
I mean, where's she?

100
00:07:27,192 --> 00:07:29,205
Oh, she's gone home.

101
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,721
She's not like you,
she's not a soldier.

102
00:07:31,756 --> 00:07:33,641
Right. So, avanti!

103
00:07:42,801 --> 00:07:44,840
Leave it.

104
00:07:44,875 --> 00:07:46,845
Turn away.

105
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,606
Civilisation is falling!

106
00:07:48,641 --> 00:07:51,840
But it's all over the news,
sir, it's everywhere.

107
00:07:51,875 --> 00:07:54,485
Paris and New York.

108
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:57,246
It's time I told you, all of you.

109
00:07:57,281 --> 00:08:00,245
It's time I revealed what
our work has been for.

110
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:03,480
Change of plan! Good to have you
fighting alongside us, Doctor.

111
00:08:03,515 --> 00:08:07,077
I'm not. I'm not-fighting,
as in not hyphen fighting, got it?

112
00:08:07,112 --> 00:08:10,640
Now, does anyone know what this
gas is yet? We're working on it.

113
00:08:10,675 --> 00:08:14,017
It's harmful but not lethal
until it reaches 80% density.

114
00:08:14,052 --> 00:08:17,360
We're having the first reports
of deaths from Tokyo City.

115
00:08:17,395 --> 00:08:18,765
And who are you?

116
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:22,220
Captain Marion Price, sir. Oh, put
your hand down. Don't salute.

117
00:08:22,255 --> 00:08:25,988
Jodrell Bank's traced a signal
coming from 5,000 miles above Earth.

118
00:08:26,023 --> 00:08:29,721
We're guessing that's what triggered
the cars. The Sontaran ship.

119
00:08:29,756 --> 00:08:32,526
NATO has gone to Defcon One,
we're preparing a strike.

120
00:08:32,561 --> 00:08:36,645
Nuclear missiles
won't even scratch the surface.
Let me talk to the Sontarans.

121
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:41,241
You're not authorised
to speak on behalf of the Earth.
Oh, I earned that a long time ago.

122
00:08:41,276 --> 00:08:44,205
Calling the Sontaran Command Ship
under Jurisdiction Two

123
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:47,760
of the Intergalactic Rules of
Engagement. This is The Doctor.

124
00:08:47,795 --> 00:08:51,961
Doctor, I'm here. Can you hear me?

125
00:08:51,996 --> 00:08:54,258
Doctor. Breathing your last?

126
00:08:54,293 --> 00:08:56,486
My God. They're like trolls.

127
00:08:56,521 --> 00:08:59,120
Yeah, loving the diplomacy, thanks.

128
00:08:59,155 --> 00:09:02,646
So, tell me, General Staal.

129
00:09:02,681 --> 00:09:06,841
Since when did you lot
become cowards? How dare you!

130
00:09:06,876 --> 00:09:08,286
Oh, that's diplomacy?

131
00:09:08,321 --> 00:09:10,045
Doctor! You impugn my honour!

132
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:15,840
Yeah. I'm really glad you didn't
say belittle cos then I'd have
a field day. But poison gas?

133
00:09:15,875 --> 00:09:18,778
That's the weapon of a coward
and you know it.

134
00:09:18,813 --> 00:09:21,646
Staal, you could blast
this planet out of the sky.

135
00:09:21,681 --> 00:09:24,401
And yet you're sitting up above
watching it die.

136
00:09:24,436 --> 00:09:27,121
Where's the fight in that?
Where's the honour?

137
00:09:27,156 --> 00:09:30,486
Or are you lot
planning something else?

138
00:09:30,521 --> 00:09:34,245
Cos this isn't normal Sontaran
warfare. What are you lot up to?

139
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:38,641
A General would be unwise to reveal
his strategy to the opposing forces.

140
00:09:38,676 --> 00:09:41,881
Ahhh, the war's not going so
well, then? Losing, are we?

141
00:09:41,916 --> 00:09:44,166
Such a suggestion is impossible.

142
00:09:44,201 --> 00:09:48,020
What war? The war between
the Sontarans and the Rutans.

143
00:09:48,055 --> 00:09:51,840
It's been raging, far out in
the stars, for 50,000 years.

144
00:09:51,875 --> 00:09:56,281
50,000 years of bloodshed.
And for what?

145
00:09:56,316 --> 00:09:58,966
For victory! Sontar-ha!

146
00:09:59,001 --> 00:10:03,241
Sontar-ha! Sontar-ha! Sontar-ha!

147
00:10:04,921 --> 00:10:06,200
Give me a break.

148
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:14,840
Doctor, I would seriously recommend
that this dialogue is handled by
official Earth representation.

149
00:10:14,875 --> 00:10:20,081
Finished? You will not be so quick
to ridicule when you see our prize.

150
00:10:20,116 --> 00:10:21,645
Behold!

151
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:26,400
We are the first Sontarans in
history to capture a TARDIS!

152
00:10:26,435 --> 00:10:30,001
Well, as prizes go, that's...

153
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:36,326
Noble. As they say in Latin,
"Donna" nobis pacem.

154
00:10:36,361 --> 00:10:40,046
That's me. I'm here! But did you
never wonder about its design?

155
00:10:40,081 --> 00:10:45,001
It's a phone box,
it contains a phone. A telephonic
device for communication.

156
00:10:45,036 --> 00:10:46,086
It's sort of symbolic.

157
00:10:46,121 --> 00:10:48,765
Like, if only we could communicate,
you and I.

158
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,680
All you have communicated
is your distress, Doctor.

159
00:10:51,715 --> 00:10:54,165
Oh, my God.

160
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:56,881
Big mistake though,
showing it to me.

161
00:10:56,916 --> 00:10:58,525
But who do I phone?

162
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,320
Cos I've got a remote control.

163
00:11:00,355 --> 00:11:01,885
Cease transmission!

164
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:04,961
Doctor! What number are you on?

165
00:11:05,801 --> 00:11:07,445
You haven't even got a number!

166
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:11,960
Remove the box from the War Room,
beyond the transmission field.

167
00:11:11,995 --> 00:11:15,560
Well, that achieved nothing.
Oh, you'd be surprised.

168
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,646
But what do I do?

169
00:11:23,681 --> 00:11:27,125
All this stuff we've been building.

170
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:30,405
All this invention.
Where's it been heading?

171
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:34,801
Gravity densifiers, hydroponics,
atmospheric conversion, ecoshells.

172
00:11:34,836 --> 00:11:37,365
More than enough to build
a brand new world!

173
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:41,441
Luke, we haven't got time for this.
I've got to find my parents.

174
00:11:41,476 --> 00:11:43,361
Oh, but this isn't just theory.

175
00:11:45,001 --> 00:11:47,005
I'm talking Planetfall.
For all of us.

176
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:50,161
A brand new start,
for a brand new human race. Look.

177
00:11:53,161 --> 00:11:58,781
A new world. Far out, beyond Alpha
Geminorum, just waiting for us.

178
00:11:58,816 --> 00:12:04,401
Its official designation is Castor
36. I think of it as Earth 0.2.

179
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,405
I did wonder about Rattigan's World.

180
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:11,480
But we can take a vote on that.
What the hell are you on about?

181
00:12:11,515 --> 00:12:13,446
This is where we're going.

182
00:12:13,481 --> 00:12:16,521
I have partners.
Willing to take us there.

183
00:12:16,556 --> 00:12:19,561
Oh, he's lost it,
I haven't got time for this.

184
00:12:19,596 --> 00:12:22,046
Where are you going?
To find my brother.

185
00:12:22,081 --> 00:12:25,201
I didn't say you could leave.
I told him to put ATMOS in his car,

186
00:12:25,236 --> 00:12:27,761
I've got to go and help him.
Stay where you are!

187
00:12:29,681 --> 00:12:32,840
what do you think you're doing?
Luke... Put that down.

188
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,420
I did this for you. Don't you see?

189
00:12:38,455 --> 00:12:40,841
We've spent all our lives excluded.

190
00:12:40,876 --> 00:12:42,446
The clever ones.

191
00:12:42,481 --> 00:12:45,165
They've laughed at us
and pulled us down,

192
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:48,605
those ordinary people out there.
Those...cattle.

193
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:53,441
This is our chance to leave them
behind. You mean you want them dead?

194
00:12:53,476 --> 00:12:55,360
And I chose you to survive!

195
00:12:57,521 --> 00:13:00,605
With Planetfall, we can start again.

196
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:04,441
We can build and breed, we can
prosper, we can do anything!

197
00:13:04,476 --> 00:13:05,565
We're going to breed?

198
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:09,440
I've designed a mating programme.
I've planned the whole thing!

199
00:13:09,475 --> 00:13:11,597
Well, then. Shoot me.

200
00:13:11,632 --> 00:13:13,685
Stay where you are!

201
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:15,325
Stay where you are, I said!

202
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,720
Stay where you are, that's an order!

203
00:13:24,921 --> 00:13:26,961
Castor 36?

204
00:13:29,321 --> 00:13:31,081
You're just sick.

205
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:36,880
Guess that just proves it.

206
00:13:36,915 --> 00:13:39,206
I'm cleverer than you!

207
00:13:39,241 --> 00:13:43,041
I'm cleverer than everyone!
D'you hear me? I'm clever!

208
00:13:43,076 --> 00:13:46,841
The United Nations has issued
a directive worldwide,

209
00:13:46,876 --> 00:13:50,038
telling urban populations
to stay indoors.

210
00:13:50,073 --> 00:13:52,597
Those in rural areas
are being ordered

211
00:13:52,632 --> 00:13:55,086
to stay away
from all major cities.

212
00:13:55,121 --> 00:13:57,926
There are reports
from every country in Europe

213
00:13:57,961 --> 00:14:01,246
of thousands of people
walking across country to escape.

214
00:14:01,281 --> 00:14:05,241
And on the Eastern seaboard of
America, it's said to be reminiscent

215
00:14:05,276 --> 00:14:09,486
of Dunkirk with boats taking
refugees out into the Atlantic.

216
00:14:09,521 --> 00:14:13,760
With the freeways blocked by ATMOS
cars, populations of major cities

217
00:14:13,795 --> 00:14:17,641
are now walking across
open country to escape the fumes.

218
00:14:17,676 --> 00:14:20,018
It is being likened
to a Biblical plague.

219
00:14:20,053 --> 00:14:22,361
Some are calling
this the End of Days.

220
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:32,325
"Mum? You all right?"

221
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:35,121
Donna! Where are you, sweetheart?
Is that her?

222
00:14:35,156 --> 00:14:37,486
Oh, just finish the job.

223
00:14:37,521 --> 00:14:39,525
Your Grandad's sealing us in.

224
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:43,460
He's sealing the windows.
Our own house, and we're sealed in.

225
00:14:43,495 --> 00:14:47,360
All those things they said about
pollution and ozone and carbon,

226
00:14:48,921 --> 00:14:51,006
they're really happening,
aren't they?

227
00:14:51,041 --> 00:14:54,560
There's people working on it, Mum.
They're gonna fix it, I promise.

228
00:14:54,595 --> 00:14:56,881
Oh, like you'd know,
you're so clever?

229
00:14:56,916 --> 00:14:59,640
Oh, don't start. Please don't.

230
00:14:59,675 --> 00:15:01,686
I'm sorry.

231
00:15:01,721 --> 00:15:05,320
I wish you were here. Now, come
on Sylvia, look. That doesn't help.

232
00:15:05,355 --> 00:15:07,241
Donna? Where are you?

233
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:12,725
It's sort of hard to say.

234
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:15,660
You all right?
Yeah, fighting fit, yeah.

235
00:15:15,695 --> 00:15:18,560
Is he with you, The Doctor?
Oh, The Doctor!

236
00:15:19,561 --> 00:15:21,486
No.

237
00:15:21,521 --> 00:15:25,920
I'm all on my own. Look, you
promised he was gonna look after you.

238
00:15:25,955 --> 00:15:27,926
He will, Gramps.

239
00:15:27,961 --> 00:15:31,046
There's something he needs me to do.
I just don't know what.

240
00:15:31,081 --> 00:15:35,481
Well, the whole place is covered,
all of London, they're saying.
The whole world.

241
00:15:35,516 --> 00:15:39,001
It's the scale of it, Donna. I mean,
how can one man stop all that?

242
00:15:39,036 --> 00:15:41,166
Trust me. He can do it.

243
00:15:41,201 --> 00:15:45,681
Yeah, well, if he doesn't, you
tell him he'll have to answer to me.

244
00:15:45,716 --> 00:15:48,566
I will.

245
00:15:48,601 --> 00:15:51,241
Just as soon as I see him,

246
00:15:51,276 --> 00:15:52,961
I'll tell him.

247
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:24,320
Carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons,
nitrogen oxides but 10% unidentified.

248
00:16:24,355 --> 00:16:26,486
Some sort of artificial
heavy element.

249
00:16:26,521 --> 00:16:29,761
Ever seen anything like it? Must
be invented by the Sontarans.

250
00:16:29,796 --> 00:16:33,218
This isn't just poison. They need it
for something else. But what?

251
00:16:33,253 --> 00:16:36,640
Launch grid online and active!
Defcon One initiatives in progress.

252
00:16:36,675 --> 00:16:38,521
What?! I told you not to launch!

253
00:16:38,556 --> 00:16:40,846
The gas is at 60% density.

254
00:16:40,881 --> 00:16:43,441
80% and people start dying.
We've got no choice.

255
00:16:43,476 --> 00:16:46,080
Launching in 60,

256
00:16:46,115 --> 00:16:48,117
59,

257
00:16:48,152 --> 00:16:50,085
58,

258
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:53,326
57, 56...

259
00:16:53,361 --> 00:16:56,041
Worldwide nuclear grid
now co-ordinating.

260
00:16:56,076 --> 00:16:58,880
54, 53...

261
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,926
The planet is going nuclear!

262
00:17:01,961 --> 00:17:07,040
I admire them. The bravery of idiots
is bravery nonetheless.

263
00:17:07,075 --> 00:17:09,245
The Operative is in place, sir.

264
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:12,200
Commander Skorr!
Is the Attack Squad ready?

265
00:17:12,235 --> 00:17:14,478
Ready and eager for battle, sir!

266
00:17:14,513 --> 00:17:16,721
It'll be good to taste blood.

267
00:17:19,121 --> 00:17:23,161
You're making a mistake, Colonel.
For once, I hope the Sontarans
are ahead of you.

268
00:17:23,196 --> 00:17:25,378
North America, online.

269
00:17:25,413 --> 00:17:27,525
United Kingdom, online.

270
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:31,921
France, online. India, online.

271
00:17:31,956 --> 00:17:34,166
Pakistan, online.

272
00:17:34,201 --> 00:17:37,681
China, online. North Korea, online.

273
00:17:37,716 --> 00:17:41,161
All systems locked and coordinated.

274
00:17:41,196 --> 00:17:43,520
Launching in 10,

275
00:17:43,555 --> 00:17:45,877
9, 8,

276
00:17:45,912 --> 00:17:47,596
7, 6,

277
00:17:47,631 --> 00:17:49,245
5...

278
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:54,240
God save us. ..4, 3, 2, 1,

279
00:17:54,275 --> 00:17:55,241
0.

280
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,740
What is it? What happened?

281
00:18:06,775 --> 00:18:09,161
Did we launch? Well? Did we?

282
00:18:09,196 --> 00:18:10,406
Negative, sir.

283
00:18:10,441 --> 00:18:14,960
The launch codes have been wiped,
sir. Must be the Sontarans.
Can we override it?

284
00:18:14,995 --> 00:18:17,960
Trying it now, sir. Missiles
wouldn't even dent that ship,

285
00:18:17,995 --> 00:18:20,000
so why are the Sontarans
so keen to stop you?

286
00:18:20,035 --> 00:18:22,045
Any ideas?

287
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:24,046
How should I know?

288
00:18:24,081 --> 00:18:25,841
Now protect the Operative!

289
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,321
Stinking out there.

290
00:18:50,281 --> 00:18:52,160
Sssh. Keep it down, lads.

291
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:58,481
Enemy within! At arms! Greyhound 40
declaring absolute emergency.

292
00:18:58,516 --> 00:19:01,600
Sontarans within factory grounds,
east corridor grid six.

293
00:19:01,635 --> 00:19:03,926
Absolute emergency,
declaring Code Red.

294
00:19:03,961 --> 00:19:06,920
All troops, Code Red!
Get them out of there!

295
00:19:07,841 --> 00:19:09,440
All troops, open fire!

296
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:17,280
The guns aren't working. Inform all
troops, standard weapons do not work.

297
00:19:22,201 --> 00:19:24,641
Tell The Doctor it's
that Cordolaine signal.

298
00:19:24,676 --> 00:19:26,641
He's the only one who can stop them.

299
00:19:36,841 --> 00:19:40,281
Greyhound 40, report. Over.

300
00:19:40,316 --> 00:19:42,001
Greyhound 40, report.

301
00:19:44,521 --> 00:19:46,360
Greyhound 40, report.

302
00:19:48,521 --> 00:19:52,321
He wasn't Greyhound 40,
his name was Ross.

303
00:19:52,356 --> 00:19:56,121
Now, listen to me
and GET THEM OUT OF THERE!

304
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:01,520
Trap One to all stations.

305
00:20:01,555 --> 00:20:03,125
Retreat.

306
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:06,281
Order imperative, immediate retreat!
Retreat! Retreat!

307
00:20:20,281 --> 00:20:22,121
Reporting for duty, sir.

308
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:31,680
This is too easy. They're running
like slimebait from a speelfox.

309
00:20:47,161 --> 00:20:50,201
This isn't war, this is sport!

310
00:20:55,321 --> 00:21:00,480
They've taken the factory.
Why? They don't need it, why attack
now? What are they up to?

311
00:21:00,515 --> 00:21:02,680
Times like this, I could do
with the Brigadier.

312
00:21:02,715 --> 00:21:05,286
No offence. None taken.

313
00:21:05,321 --> 00:21:09,680
Sir Alistair's a fine man,
if not the best. Unfortunately,
he's stranded in Peru.

314
00:21:09,715 --> 00:21:11,881
Launch grid back online.

315
00:21:17,721 --> 00:21:21,561
They're inside the system, sir.
It's coming from within UNIT itself.

316
00:21:21,596 --> 00:21:25,401
Trace it, find out where it's
coming from and quickly! Gas levels?

317
00:21:25,436 --> 00:21:29,606
66% in major population areas
and rising.

318
00:21:29,641 --> 00:21:33,361
Commander Skorr reports victory
with many glorious deaths.

319
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,400
I'm sorry to report, sir,

320
00:21:37,435 --> 00:21:39,966
I've failed.

321
00:21:40,001 --> 00:21:41,725
They wouldn't come.

322
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:45,241
The students, they didn't have
the imagination to believe.

323
00:21:45,276 --> 00:21:47,565
A pity.

324
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:50,120
We've lost our target practice!

325
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:56,761
What do you mean? Upon arrival on
board this ship, your students

326
00:21:56,796 --> 00:21:59,520
Perhaps they were more clever
than you thought.

327
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:04,520
You promised...
There was no Planetfall!

328
00:22:04,555 --> 00:22:07,886
Castor 36, indeed!

329
00:22:07,921 --> 00:22:11,281
We only needed you for installation
of the ATMOS system.

330
00:22:11,316 --> 00:22:13,640
No, but I'm on your side.

331
00:22:14,641 --> 00:22:16,320
I did everything you wanted.

332
00:22:17,681 --> 00:22:20,160
And it's not ATMOS-system,
that's a tautology.

333
00:22:20,195 --> 00:22:22,201
It's just ATMOS. Execute him!

334
00:22:24,441 --> 00:22:26,525
A coward's retreat.

335
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:30,360
Now close all teleport links
to Earth.

336
00:22:30,395 --> 00:22:33,680
Isolate them as they perish.

337
00:22:47,081 --> 00:22:50,120
Why are they defending the factory
only after we're inside?

338
00:22:50,155 --> 00:22:52,046
Because they wanted UNIT here.

339
00:22:52,081 --> 00:22:57,641
You gave them something
they needed, something now
hidden inside the factory.

340
00:22:57,676 --> 00:23:00,086
Something precious.
We've got to recover it.

341
00:23:00,121 --> 00:23:04,640
How does this Cordolaine signal
work? It's the bullets. Causes
expansion of the copper shell.

342
00:23:04,675 --> 00:23:08,840
I'm on it. For the billionth time,
you can't fight Sontarans!

343
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:16,321
Phone, have you got a phone? I need
your mobile, quickly, hurry up.

344
00:23:25,321 --> 00:23:29,721
What's happened, where are you?
Earth. But don't worry.
I've got my secret weapon.

345
00:23:29,756 --> 00:23:31,445
And what's that? You!

346
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:33,726
Somehow, that's not making me happy.

347
00:23:33,761 --> 00:23:36,565
Can't you just zap us down to Earth
with that remote?

348
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:39,605
I haven't got a remote, though
I should. I need you there.

349
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:44,000
That's why I made them
move the TARDIS. I'm sorry,
but you've got to go outside.

350
00:23:44,035 --> 00:23:45,526
There's Sonterruns out there.

351
00:23:45,561 --> 00:23:48,281
Sontarans. They'll be on battle
stations right now.

352
00:23:48,316 --> 00:23:50,778
I can talk you through it.

353
00:23:50,813 --> 00:23:53,206
But what if they find me?

354
00:23:53,241 --> 00:23:55,721
I know, but there is
nothing else I can do.

355
00:23:55,756 --> 00:23:57,561
The whole planet is choking, Donna.

356
00:24:00,881 --> 00:24:02,766
What do you need me to do?

357
00:24:02,801 --> 00:24:05,480
The Sontarans have got
a teleport link with the ship.

358
00:24:05,515 --> 00:24:08,125
They'll have deadlocked it.
I need you to reopen it.

359
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:13,001
I can't even mend a fuse. Stop
talking about yourself like that.
You can do this, I promise.

360
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:26,806
There's a Sonterrun... Sontaran.

361
00:24:26,841 --> 00:24:29,845
Did he see you? No, he's got
his back to me.

362
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:33,040
On the back of his neck there's
a sort of plug, like a hole.

363
00:24:33,075 --> 00:24:36,200
The Probic Vent. One blow to
the Probic Vent knocks 'em out.

364
00:24:36,235 --> 00:24:38,277
But he's gonna kill me. I'm sorry.

365
00:24:38,312 --> 00:24:40,320
I'm so sorry. But you've got to try.

366
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:12,041
Back of the neck!

367
00:25:13,081 --> 00:25:16,441
Now find the external junction feed
to the teleport.

368
00:25:16,476 --> 00:25:19,766
What's it look like?
"Circular panel on the wall."

369
00:25:19,801 --> 00:25:25,001
Big symbol on the front, like
a letter T with a horizontal line
through it. Or two Fs back to back.

370
00:25:25,036 --> 00:25:26,726
Well, there's a door.

371
00:25:26,761 --> 00:25:29,140
Should be a switch by the side.
There is.

372
00:25:29,175 --> 00:25:31,520
It's Sontaran-shaped,
you need three fingers.

373
00:25:31,555 --> 00:25:33,081
You've got three fingers.

374
00:25:33,116 --> 00:25:34,801
Oh, yeah.

375
00:25:43,161 --> 00:25:45,721
"I'm through."
Oh, you are brilliant, you are.

376
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:49,500
Shut up.

377
00:25:49,535 --> 00:25:51,246
Right.

378
00:25:51,281 --> 00:25:53,525
T with a line through it.

379
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:56,766
Got to go. Keep the line open!
Counter-attack!

380
00:25:56,801 --> 00:26:01,321
I said you don't stand a chance!
Positions. That means everyone!

381
00:26:05,161 --> 00:26:08,240
You're not going without me.
Wouldn't dream of it.

382
00:26:32,761 --> 00:26:36,320
Latest firing stock, what do you
think, Doctor? Are you my mummy?

383
00:26:36,355 --> 00:26:37,886
If you could concentrate.

384
00:26:37,921 --> 00:26:41,761
Bullets with a rad-steel coating,
no copper surface.

385
00:26:41,796 --> 00:26:43,921
Should overcome
the Cordolaine signal.

386
00:26:43,956 --> 00:26:45,486
But the Sontarans have lasers!

387
00:26:45,521 --> 00:26:48,560
You can't even see in this fog,
night-vision doesn't work.

388
00:26:48,595 --> 00:26:51,118
Thank you for your lack of faith.

389
00:26:51,153 --> 00:26:53,641
But this time, I'm not listening.

390
00:26:53,676 --> 00:26:56,366
Attention, all troops!

391
00:26:56,401 --> 00:26:59,445
The Sontarans might
think of us as primitive.

392
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:02,806
As does every passing species
with an axe to grind.

393
00:27:02,841 --> 00:27:07,241
They make a mockery of our weapons,
our soldiers, our ideals.

394
00:27:07,276 --> 00:27:10,446
But no more!
From this point on, it stops.

395
00:27:10,481 --> 00:27:15,121
From this point on, the people of
Earth fight back and we show them!

396
00:27:15,156 --> 00:27:18,361
We show the warriors of Sontar
what the human race can do!

397
00:27:18,396 --> 00:27:22,201
Trap One to Hawk Major! Go, go, go!

398
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:33,241
It's working. The area's clearing.

399
00:27:34,521 --> 00:27:36,500
Engines to maximum!

400
00:27:36,535 --> 00:27:38,480
It's the Valiant!

401
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:48,020
UNIT Carrier Ship Valiant
reporting for duty, Doctor!

402
00:27:48,055 --> 00:27:51,560
With engines strong enough
to clear away the fog.

403
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:07,160
That's brilliant!
Getting a taste for it, Doctor?

404
00:28:07,195 --> 00:28:09,277
No, not at all. Not me.

405
00:28:09,312 --> 00:28:11,360
Valiant, fire at will!

406
00:28:35,881 --> 00:28:37,941
East and north secure. Doctor?

407
00:28:37,976 --> 00:28:39,966
Donna, hold on. I'm coming.

408
00:28:40,001 --> 00:28:42,326
Shouldn't we follow the Colonel?

409
00:28:42,361 --> 00:28:45,080
Nah, you and me, Martha Jones.
Just like old times!

410
00:28:45,115 --> 00:28:47,240
Alien technology, this way!

411
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:56,881
The honour of battle. The glory!

412
00:29:05,321 --> 00:29:07,601
No Sontarans down here.

413
00:29:07,636 --> 00:29:09,881
They can't resist a battle.

414
00:29:31,121 --> 00:29:33,361
Ohh, Martha. I'm so sorry.

415
00:29:33,396 --> 00:29:35,761
Still alive.

416
00:29:39,481 --> 00:29:41,686
Am I supposed to be impressed?

417
00:29:41,721 --> 00:29:44,166
Wish you carried a gun now?
Not at all.

418
00:29:44,201 --> 00:29:48,401
I've been stopping the
nuclear launch all this time.
Doing exactly what I wanted.

419
00:29:48,436 --> 00:29:51,281
I needed to stop the missiles,
as much as the Sontarans.

420
00:29:51,316 --> 00:29:53,565
I'm not having Earth start
an interstellar war.

421
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:56,680
You're a triple agent! When did you
know? Right from the start.

422
00:29:56,715 --> 00:29:59,761
Reduced iris contraction,
thinning of the hair
on the left temple.

423
00:29:59,796 --> 00:30:01,806
And, frankly, you smell.

424
00:30:01,841 --> 00:30:04,640
You might as well have worn
a T-shirt saying "clone".

425
00:30:04,675 --> 00:30:07,046
Although maybe not
in front of Captain Jack.

426
00:30:07,081 --> 00:30:11,321
You remember him, don't you?
Cos you've got all her memories.

427
00:30:11,356 --> 00:30:14,921
That's why the Sontarans
had to protect her,

428
00:30:14,956 --> 00:30:16,845
to keep you inside UNIT.

429
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:19,961
Martha Jones is keeping you alive.

430
00:30:24,241 --> 00:30:28,081
It's all right. It's all right,
I'm here, I'm here. I've got you.

431
00:30:28,116 --> 00:30:31,441
There was this thing, Doctor,
this alien, with this head...

432
00:30:32,561 --> 00:30:34,406
Blimey, I'm busy. Got it?

433
00:30:34,441 --> 00:30:37,526
Yes. Now hurry up!
"Take off the covering."

434
00:30:37,561 --> 00:30:40,681
All the blue switches inside,
flick them up like a fusebox.

435
00:30:40,716 --> 00:30:43,161
And that should get
the teleport working.

436
00:30:43,196 --> 00:30:45,498
Oh, my God.

437
00:30:45,533 --> 00:30:47,800
That's me.

438
00:30:49,361 --> 00:30:50,720
You will face me, sir!

439
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:59,441
Wonderful.

440
00:31:07,441 --> 00:31:09,180
Don't touch me!

441
00:31:09,215 --> 00:31:10,885
It's not my fault.

442
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:14,880
The Sontarans created you.
But you had all my memories.

443
00:31:14,915 --> 00:31:19,561
You've got a brother, sister,
mother and father.

444
00:31:19,596 --> 00:31:22,481
If you don't help me,
they're going to die.

445
00:31:22,516 --> 00:31:24,045
You love them.

446
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:26,000
Yes. Remember that?

447
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:30,480
The gas! Tell us about the gas.

448
00:31:30,515 --> 00:31:34,280
He's the enemy! Then tell me.

449
00:31:37,961 --> 00:31:40,801
Caesofine concentrate.

450
00:31:40,836 --> 00:31:43,606
It's one part Bosteen,

451
00:31:43,641 --> 00:31:46,001
two parts Probic 5. Clonefeed!

452
00:31:46,036 --> 00:31:47,685
It's clonefeed!

453
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:50,680
What's clonefeed?
Like amniotic fluid, for Sontarans.

454
00:31:50,715 --> 00:31:52,686
They're converting the atmosphere.

455
00:31:52,721 --> 00:31:56,240
Changing the planet into a clone
world. Earth becomes a hatchery.

456
00:31:56,275 --> 00:31:59,166
The Sontarans are clones,
it's how they reproduce.

457
00:31:59,201 --> 00:32:02,720
Give 'em a planet this big, they'll
create billions of new soldiers.

458
00:32:02,755 --> 00:32:04,921
That gas isn't poison, it's food!

459
00:32:07,081 --> 00:32:09,920
My heart... It's getting slower.

460
00:32:09,955 --> 00:32:12,206
There's nothing I can do.

461
00:32:12,241 --> 00:32:14,660
In your mind,
you've got so many plans.

462
00:32:14,695 --> 00:32:17,045
There's so much that you want to do.

463
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:21,040
And I will. Never do tomorrow
what you can do today, my mum says.

464
00:32:21,075 --> 00:32:23,641
Cos... Cos you never know
how long you've got.

465
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:27,980
Martha Jones...

466
00:32:28,015 --> 00:32:30,240
All that life.

467
00:33:00,521 --> 00:33:02,520
Doctor.

468
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:06,641
Blue switches done.

469
00:33:09,601 --> 00:33:11,441
But they've found me!

470
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:12,800
Now!

471
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:20,040
Have I ever told you
how much I hate you?

472
00:33:20,075 --> 00:33:22,241
Hold on, hold on.
Get off me, get off me!

473
00:33:22,276 --> 00:33:24,000
Gotta bring the TARDIS down.

474
00:33:28,281 --> 00:33:31,760
Right, now. Martha, you coming?
What about this nuclear launch?

475
00:33:31,795 --> 00:33:35,240
Just keep pressing N, we want to
keep those missiles on the ground.

476
00:33:36,721 --> 00:33:38,326
But there's...

477
00:33:38,361 --> 00:33:41,201
Two of them. Yeah, long story.

478
00:33:42,641 --> 00:33:44,881
Here we go.
The old team, back together!

479
00:33:44,916 --> 00:33:46,605
Well, the new team.

480
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:48,806
We're not going back on that ship!
No, no.

481
00:33:48,841 --> 00:33:51,641
I needed to get the teleport
working so we could get to...

482
00:33:53,201 --> 00:33:56,445
Here!
The Rattigan Academy, owned by...

483
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:59,600
Don't tell anyone what I did.
The Sontarans lied to me.

484
00:33:59,635 --> 00:34:02,240
If I see one more gun...

485
00:34:06,481 --> 00:34:09,520
You know, that coat sort of works.

486
00:34:09,555 --> 00:34:12,525
Feel like a kid in my Dad's clothes.

487
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:15,041
If you're calling him Dad
you're getting over him.

488
00:34:15,076 --> 00:34:18,366
A human female, on board ship.

489
00:34:18,401 --> 00:34:23,081
It could only be The Doctor's work
and all the teleport systems
have been deadlocked open.

490
00:34:23,116 --> 00:34:26,641
No matter. Increase the
ATMOS devices to maximum.

491
00:34:26,676 --> 00:34:28,926
Choke them!

492
00:34:28,961 --> 00:34:31,880
Behold, the cloneworld is born.

493
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:51,566
Oh, my little girl.

494
00:34:51,601 --> 00:34:53,925
Come on. We'll be all right.

495
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:56,280
We'll be all right. Donna said so.

496
00:34:56,315 --> 00:34:58,125
She promised.

497
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:01,125
Come on, darling. It's all right.

498
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:04,640
That's why the Sontarans stopped
the missiles, to hold back.

499
00:35:06,281 --> 00:35:10,041
caesofine gas is volatile, so they
used you to stop the nuclear attack.

500
00:35:10,076 --> 00:35:12,645
Ground-to-air engagement
could've sparked it off.

501
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:16,441
What, set fire to the atmosphere?
Yeah. They need the gas
to breed their army.

502
00:35:16,476 --> 00:35:19,881
And all the time we had Luke here.
Planning a little trip, were we?

503
00:35:19,916 --> 00:35:22,361
They promised me a new world.
And you built equipment

504
00:35:22,396 --> 00:35:24,285
ready to terraform El Mondo Luko,

505
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:28,561
so that humans could live there
and breathe the air with this!

506
00:35:28,596 --> 00:35:30,161
An atmospheric convertor.

507
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:38,841
Prepare to launch clone pods.
We will breed across the
surface of the earth.

508
00:35:38,876 --> 00:35:41,280
For the glory of Sontar!

509
00:35:52,561 --> 00:35:56,526
That's London.
You can't even see it.

510
00:35:56,561 --> 00:36:00,960
My family's in there.
If I can get this on the right
setting... Doctor, hold on.

511
00:36:00,995 --> 00:36:04,160
You said the atmosphere would
ignite. Yeah. I did, didn't I?

512
00:36:19,921 --> 00:36:22,400
Please, please, please, please...

513
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:40,260
General Staal, sir.

514
00:36:40,295 --> 00:36:42,080
What's happening?

515
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:45,606
He's a genius!

516
00:37:45,641 --> 00:37:48,200
Just brilliant!
Now we're in trouble.

517
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:54,800
It seems we must revert
to Basic Sontaran Stratagem One.

518
00:37:54,835 --> 00:37:56,918
We will ravage this planet.

519
00:37:56,953 --> 00:37:59,517
Prepare weapons! Wipe them out!

520
00:37:59,552 --> 00:38:02,081
Every last stinking human beast!

521
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:06,006
Right, so...

522
00:38:06,041 --> 00:38:08,761
Donna. Thank you, for everything.

523
00:38:08,796 --> 00:38:11,398
Martha, you too.

524
00:38:11,433 --> 00:38:14,000
Oh...so many times.

525
00:38:15,721 --> 00:38:19,321
Luke.
Do something clever with your life.

526
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:27,125
They'll be getting ready for war.

527
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:31,561
And, well,
you know, I've recalibrated
this for Sontaran air, so...

528
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:35,600
You're gonna ignite them.

529
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:40,246
You'll kill yourself.

530
00:38:40,281 --> 00:38:42,121
Just send that thing up, on its own.

531
00:38:42,156 --> 00:38:43,960
I dunno, put it on a delay.

532
00:38:45,561 --> 00:38:47,000
I can't.

533
00:38:48,881 --> 00:38:51,086
Why not?

534
00:38:51,121 --> 00:38:53,600
I've got to give them a choice.

535
00:39:18,761 --> 00:39:21,045
Oh, excellent.

536
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:23,800
General Staal.
You know what this is.

537
00:39:23,835 --> 00:39:25,481
But there's one more option.

538
00:39:25,516 --> 00:39:27,926
You can go, just leave.

539
00:39:27,961 --> 00:39:30,726
Sontaran High Command need
never know what happened.

540
00:39:30,761 --> 00:39:36,001
Your stratagem would be wise
if Sontarans feared death.
But we do not.

541
00:39:36,036 --> 00:39:37,681
At arms!

542
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:44,565
If it saves the Earth, I'll do it.

543
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:48,480
A warrior doesn't talk, he acts!
I am giving you the chance to leave.

544
00:39:48,515 --> 00:39:50,886
And miss the glory of this moment?

545
00:39:50,921 --> 00:39:53,801
All weapons targeting Earth, sir.
Firing in 20. I warn you!

546
00:39:53,836 --> 00:39:56,285
And I salute you! Take aim!

547
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:59,240
Shoot me, I'm still gonna
press this. You'll die, Staal.

548
00:39:59,275 --> 00:40:01,366
Knowing that you die, too.

549
00:40:01,401 --> 00:40:03,481
Firing in 15.
For the glory of Sontar!

550
00:40:03,516 --> 00:40:05,560
Sontar-ha! Sontar-ha! Sontar-ha!

551
00:40:05,595 --> 00:40:08,137
Sontar-ha! Sontar-ha!

552
00:40:08,172 --> 00:40:10,680
Sontar-ha! Sontar-ha!

553
00:40:13,601 --> 00:40:16,681
Sontar-ha! Sontar-ha!
Sontar-ha! I'll do it!

554
00:40:16,716 --> 00:40:18,481
Then do it! Sontar-ha!

555
00:40:20,201 --> 00:40:22,201
What are you doing?
Something clever.

556
00:40:23,881 --> 00:40:26,540
10, 9, 8,

557
00:40:26,575 --> 00:40:28,908
7, 6, 5,

558
00:40:28,943 --> 00:40:31,206
4, 3...

559
00:40:31,241 --> 00:40:33,680
Sontar-ha! ..2, 1.

560
00:41:14,481 --> 00:41:17,445
Morning. Morning.

561
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:20,280
Walked all the way,
won't catch me driving.

562
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:28,320
The streets are half-empty.
People still aren't driving.

563
00:41:28,355 --> 00:41:31,977
There's kids on bikes all
over the place, it's wonderful.

564
00:41:32,012 --> 00:41:35,600
Unpack that lot, I'm gonna
see if Suzette's all right.

565
00:41:39,521 --> 00:41:42,641
I won't tell her.

566
00:41:45,361 --> 00:41:47,921
Just keep it
as our little secret, eh?

567
00:41:47,956 --> 00:41:50,685
Yeah.

568
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:54,961
And you go with him,
that wonderful Doctor.

569
00:41:54,996 --> 00:41:56,801
You go and see the stars.

570
00:42:00,521 --> 00:42:04,520
And then bring a bit of 'em back,
for your old gramps.

571
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:22,961
Love you.

572
00:42:35,081 --> 00:42:36,560
How were they?

573
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:41,841
Oh, same old stuff.

574
00:42:41,876 --> 00:42:43,725
They're fine.

575
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:48,161
So! You gonna come with us?
We're not exactly short of space.

576
00:42:48,196 --> 00:42:51,078
Oh, I have missed all this.

577
00:42:51,113 --> 00:42:53,960
But, you know. I'm good here.

578
00:42:53,995 --> 00:42:56,526
Back at home.

579
00:42:56,561 --> 00:42:58,441
And I'm better for having been away.

580
00:42:58,476 --> 00:43:01,686
Besides, someone needs me.

581
00:43:01,721 --> 00:43:04,760
Never mind the universe, I've got
a big world of my own now.

582
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:10,520
What?! What?

583
00:43:13,921 --> 00:43:17,480
Doctor! Don't you dare! No, no, no!
I didn't touch anything!

584
00:43:17,515 --> 00:43:20,046
We're in flight, it's not me!

585
00:43:20,081 --> 00:43:24,200
Where are we going?
I dunno, it's out of control!

586
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:30,841
Doctor, just listen to me,
you take me home!

587
00:43:30,876 --> 00:43:32,921
Take me home right now!

588
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:47,601
Where did she come from? From me.

589
00:43:47,636 --> 00:43:50,720
From you? How?

590
00:43:53,401 --> 00:43:54,440
Well...

591
00:43:56,561 --> 00:43:58,001
I'd like to see you try that.

592
00:44:02,041 --> 00:44:03,801
She's my daughter.

593
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:07,200
Hello, Dad.
