2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:01,640
Get down!

3
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:06,640
Did they see you? I don't know.

4
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:11,600
I was too busy running! It's important,
did they see your face? No. Off we go.

5
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:19,800
They're following us. But
you've got a time machine!

6
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:24,320
Stolen technology. They've got a
Time Agent's Vortex Manipulator.

7
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:27,200
Across the universe.
They won't stop.

8
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:32,080
Unless... I'll have to do it.

9
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:35,320
Martha, you trust me? Of
course. It all depends on you.

10
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:36,880
What does? What do I do?

11
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:42,320
Take this watch, my life depends on
it. This watch, Martha, this watch is...

12
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,600
KNOCK AT DOOR

13
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:58,600
Come in.

14
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:03,440
Pardon me, Mr Smith, you're not
dressed. It's all right, put it down.

15
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:09,400
I was, um...

16
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:16,200
Sometimes, I have these
extraordinary dreams.

17
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:19,880
What about, sir?
I dream I'm this...

18
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,920
adventurer,

19
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:24,520
this daredevil, a madman.

20
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,920
"The Doctor", I'm called.

21
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:29,440
And last night I dreamt

22
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:32,000
that you were there.

23
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:34,480
As my... companion.

24
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:37,480
A teacher and a
housemaid? Impossible.

25
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,600
I was a man from another world.

26
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:44,120
Then it can't be true,
because there's no such thing.

27
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:46,680
This thing, the watch. It was...

28
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,760
Funny how dreams slip away. But I remember
one thing, it all took place in the future.

29
00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:00,040
In the year of Our Lord 2007.

30
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:03,480
I can prove that wrong, sir.
Here's the morning paper.

31
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:09,200
It's Monday November 10th 1913
and you're completely human, sir.

32
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:13,160
As human as they
come. Hmm, that's me.

33
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,920
Completely human.

34
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:59,520
CHILDREN SING: # He
who would valiant be

35
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:04,520
# 'Gainst all disaster

36
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:08,960
# Let him in constancy

37
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,320
# Follow the master... #

38
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:17,040
Morning, sir.

39
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,480
Morning, sir.

40
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:23,960
# There no discouragement
shall make him once relent... #

41
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,720
Headmaster.

42
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:30,280
# His first avowed intent
to be a pilgrim... #

43
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:32,840
...advanced with little impediment.

44
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:37,520
The French were all but spent,
with only two battalions remaining.

45
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:41,960
The final reserve force was
charged with protecting Napoleon.

46
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,480
But, by evening, the advance of the
allied troops had forced them to retreat.

47
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:55,400
Morning, sir.

48
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,200
Yes, quite.

49
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:02,160
Head in the clouds, that one.

50
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:05,360
Don't know why you're
so sweet on him.

51
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:12,800
He's kind to me. Not everyone's that considerate,
what with me being... A Londoner? Exactly!

52
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:17,000
Now then, you two. You're
not paid to have fun, are you?

53
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,240
Put a little backbone into it.

54
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:24,800
Yes, sir. Sorry, sir. You, there. What's
your name? Martha, sir. Martha Jones.

55
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:30,240
With hands like those how you
can tell when something's clean?

56
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:34,080
That's very funny, sir.

57
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:41,160
Don't answer back. I'd answer back with
my bucket over his head. Oh, I wish!

58
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:43,560
Just think, though.

59
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:47,360
Soon boys like that'll
be running the country.

60
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,440
1913.

61
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:51,000
They might not.

62
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:55,600
Ma'am. Good morning, Mr Smith.

63
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,560
How best to retrieve...?

64
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,480
If you could take these.

65
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,040
Good. No harm done.

66
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,840
So, how was Jenkins?

67
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:14,880
Just a cold. He's missing
his mother most of all.

68
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:18,920
We can't have that. He's received
a letter now, so he's chipper.

69
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:22,920
I appear to be holding your books.
Yes, so you are! Just let me...

70
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,960
No, why don't I take half?

71
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:32,200
Brilliant idea. Perfect division of
labour. We make quite a team. Don't we just?

72
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:37,040
These books, were they being taken
in any particular direction? Yes.

73
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:40,880
Um, this way.

74
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:45,840
Matron, give the boys a good head of
steam, they'll wear themselves out.

75
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:50,080
When it’s just you and me, I'd
rather you called me Nurse Redfern.

76
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:53,720
Matron sounds rather,
well, matronly.

77
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:58,280
Nurse Redfern. Though we've known each
other only two months, you could say "Joan".

78
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:00,800
Joan? That's my name. Obviously.

79
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:03,240
And it's john? Yes,
yes, it is, yes.

80
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:06,280
John, the annual dance at
the village hall tomorrow.

81
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:10,600
It's nothing formal but rather
fun. Do you think you'll go?

82
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,160
Hadn't thought about it.

83
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:19,200
It's been ages since I've been to
a dance. Only no-one's asked me.

84
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,720
Well!

85
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:24,040
I should imagine that
you'd be... I mean,

86
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:27,600
I never thought you'd be one
for... If you do! You may not.

87
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:30,840
I probably won't. But even
if I did, I couldn't...

88
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,520
I wouldn't want to...

89
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,360
The stairs. Right behind you.

90
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:42,160
Stop it. I get boys
causing less fuss than this.

91
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:44,320
But it hurts. Is he all right?

92
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:48,000
It's hardly good form to enter a
master's study without knocking.

93
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:50,120
Sorry, right, yeah.

94
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,120
SHE KNOCKS

95
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,880
But is he all right?

96
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:55,320
They said you fell down the stairs.

97
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:58,040
Just a tumble. Have you
checked for concussion?

98
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:01,800
I have, and I dare say I know
a lot more about it than you.

99
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,480
Sorry. I’ll just...

100
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,320
tidy your things.

101
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:12,080
I was just telling Nurse Redfern
- Matron - about my dreams.

102
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:14,600
They are quite remarkable tales.

103
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:19,240
I keep imagining that I'm someone
else and that I'm hiding...

104
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,160
Hiding? In what way?

105
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:25,000
Um... They're almost every night.

106
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:27,920
This is going to
sound silly. Tell me.

107
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:32,840
I dream, quite often,
that I have two hearts.

108
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:35,920
Well, then. I can be the
judge of that. Let's find out.

109
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:47,240
HEARTBEAT

110
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:51,760
I can confirm the diagnosis.

111
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,640
Just one heart, singular.

112
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,800
I have, um, I have written
down some of these dreams

113
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:02,480
in the form of... Fiction. Not that it would
be of any interest I would be very interested.

114
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Well, I've never actually

115
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:13,640
shown it to anyone before.

116
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,240
"A journal of Impossible Things".

117
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:25,920
Just look at these
creatures, such imagination.

118
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:28,040
It's become quite a hobby.

119
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:38,280
But it's wonderful. And quite
an eye for the pretty girls.

120
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:41,960
She’s just an invention. This
character, Rose, I call her.

121
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,680
Rose.

122
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,520
She disappears later on.

123
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:53,200
Oh, that's the box.

124
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:56,360
The blue box, it's always there.

125
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,160
Like a magic carpet.

126
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:01,400
This box that transports
me to faraway places.

127
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,720
Like a doorway? Mm.

128
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:09,400
I sometimes think how magical life
would be if stories like this were true.

129
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,600
If only.

130
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:15,160
All just a dream.

131
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,640
BELL RINGS

132
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,760
Ma'am,

133
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,760
that book.

134
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:24,920
I'll look after it. Don't worry.
He did say I could read it.

135
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:27,120
But it's silly, that's all.

136
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:29,040
Just stories.

137
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:34,000
Who is he, Martha? I'm sorry?
It's like he's left the kettle on.

138
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:38,280
He knows he has something to get
back to, but he can't remember what.

139
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:42,680
That’s just him. You arrived with him. He
found you employment, here at the school?

140
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,800
I used to work for the
family, he inherited me.

141
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,880
Well, I'd be careful.

142
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:54,040
You sometimes seem a little familiar
with him. Best remember your position.

143
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,920
Yes, ma'am.

144
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,800
Ah, Latimer.

145
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:03,760
Latin translation. Blasted
Catullus, I want it done by morning.

146
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:09,560
Yes, sir. And no mistakes, I want
it written in my best handwriting.

147
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,000
But listen, Father
says he's been promoted.

148
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:13,200
That means more money,
might get a better school.

149
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,120
Ah, he should enjoy it, sir.

150
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:19,920
My uncle had a six-month posting in Johannesburg.
Says it was the most beautiful country on God's earth.

151
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:24,880
What are you talking about? Africa.
Your father. Did you read my post?

152
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:27,280
What? Who said Africa?

153
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I've only just read
the word myself.

154
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,920
How did you know that? I haven't...
Have you been spying on me? No!

155
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,080
I just guessed.

156
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:38,000
What's that mean?

157
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,440
I'm good at guessing, that's all.

158
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:43,280
Idiot.

159
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,480
Sometimes I say things and
they turn out to be correct.

160
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:54,520
Just little things, tiny things.

161
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,880
I can't help it.

162
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:00,640
It’s just some sort of luck.

163
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:04,080
Never mind that, little toad.
Who's for beer? You've got beer?

164
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:09,080
Baxter's hidden a secret supply in
Blackdown Woods. What are you waiting for?

165
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:12,640
Make sure the bursar's
down the pub before you go.

166
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:16,160
Bottle for everyone, is
it? None for the filth.

167
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,520
Hurry back, Baines, I'm parched!

168
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:21,520
Ooh, it's freezing out here.

169
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,600
Why can't we have a drink
inside? Don't be ridiculous.

170
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:29,920
You get these notions! It's all very well,
those suffragettes, but that's London!

171
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:34,080
Don't you just want to
scream sometimes? Tell 'em?

172
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:38,720
Things must be different in your country.
They are. Thank God I'm not staying.

173
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:39,680
You keep saying that.

174
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:43,840
Just you wait. One more month
and I'm as free as the wind.

175
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:49,280
Wish you could come with me. You'd love it.
Where you gonna go? Anywhere. Look up there.

176
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:53,120
Imagine you could go all
the way out to the stars.

177
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:57,000
GIGGLES You don't
half say mad things.

178
00:11:57,280 --> 00:12:01,680
That's where I'm going Into
the sky... all the way out

179
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:06,480
Did you see that?

180
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,960
See what? Did you see it, though?

181
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:11,400
Up there, just for a second.

182
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,400
There's nothing there.

183
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:55,760
Matron? Are you all right?

184
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:58,240
Did you see that?
Something in the woods.

185
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:01,480
This light...
Anything wrong, ladies?

186
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:04,240
Rather too cold to be
standing around in the dark.

187
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:06,720
There! Look, in the sky.

188
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:09,200
Oh, that's beautiful.

189
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:10,920
All gone!

190
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:13,800
Commonly known as a meteorite.

191
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:17,200
It’s just rocks
falling to the ground.

192
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:19,320
Came down in the woods. No, no.

193
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,840
They look close, but
they're miles off.

194
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:25,080
Nothing left but a cinder.

195
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:27,880
I should escort you
back to the school.

196
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:32,240
Ladies? We're fine, thanks.
Then I shall bid you good night.

197
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:38,800
Jenny, where was that? On the
horizon, where the light was headed?

198
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:40,760
That's by Cooper's Field.

199
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,720
You can't just run off!

200
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:45,200
It's dark, you'll break a leg!

201
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,120
I say, hello?

202
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,720
Was that some kind of aeroplane?

203
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,840
Are you chaps all right?

204
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,120
What?

205
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,200
That's impossible.

206
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,480
Some kind of door.

207
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:14,080
Hello?

208
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:17,760
Is anyone there?

209
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,400
There you are.

210
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:36,320
Nothing there, I told you so!

211
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,960
That's Cooper's Field?

212
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,880
As far as the eye can
see. No falling star!

213
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:43,520
I'm frozen to the bone, let's go.

214
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:46,320
As your Mr Smith
says, nothing to see.

215
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:57,200
But I don't
understand. Who are you?

216
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:58,880
We are The Family.

217
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:02,720
Far more important, who
are you, little thing?

218
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:06,200
My name's Baines. Jeremy Baines.

219
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:10,480
Please can I go? I'm so
sorry, Baines, Jeremy Baines.

220
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:13,840
But I don't think
you can ever leave.

221
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:16,280
But who are you?

222
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:21,520
Why can't I see you? Why
would you want to see us?

223
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,840
To know what you look like.

224
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:26,120
Oh, that's easily answered.

225
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:29,920
Because very soon we
will look so familiar.

226
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:30,960
HE SCREAMS

227
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:38,080
Where is he? Promises a beer
and then vanishes into the night.

228
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:43,440
There he is, let him in.

229
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:57,120
Baines, you dolt!
Thought you'd been caught.

230
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:04,240
Well, then? Where is it,
man? Where's the blessed beer?

231
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:06,560
There was no beer. It was gone.

232
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:08,160
Damn, I've been waiting!

233
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:10,800
Pretty poor show,
Baines, I have to say.

234
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:13,320
HE SNIFFS

235
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:15,600
What's the matter?
Caught the sniffles?

236
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:19,320
Yes, I must have. It was cold.

237
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:20,760
Very cold.

238
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:25,520
Don't spread it about,
I don't want your germs!

239
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:27,200
Might as well get some sleep.

240
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:32,200
Come on, chaps. Maybe tomorrow. I think
Jackson’s got beer in the pavilion.

241
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:23,280
Hello.

242
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:25,840
Talking to a machine.

243
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:43,680
Get down!

244
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,320
They're following us.

245
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:59,280
They can follow us wherever we go.

246
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:02,640
Across the universe.
They're never gonna stop.

247
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:06,160
You trust me, don't you? Of course
I do. Cos it all depends on you.

248
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:15,960
Martha, this watch is me.

249
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,720
Right, OK. Gotcha. No, hold on.

250
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:20,320
Completely lost.

251
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:23,280
Those creatures are hunters.
They sniff out anyone.

252
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:26,240
Being a Time Lord
- I'm unique. They could track me down.

253
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:28,200
And the good news is?

254
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:32,600
They can smell me, but they haven't seen
me. And their life spans are running out.

255
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,360
So, we hide. Wait for them to die.

256
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,640
But they can track us down.

257
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:39,360
That's why I've got to do it.

258
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:42,000
I have to stop being a Time Lord.

259
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:43,920
I'm going to become human.

260
00:19:56,600 --> 00:20:01,720
Never thought I'd use this. Oh,
but all the times I've wondered.

261
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,520
What does it do?

262
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,240
Chameleon Arch.

263
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:08,800
Rewrites my biology. Changes
every single cell in my body.

264
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:10,880
I've set it to human.

265
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:13,320
The TARDIS will invent
a life story for me,

266
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:17,280
find a setting and integrate me. It
can't do it for you, you improvise.

267
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:19,560
I'll have residual
awareness to let you in.

268
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:23,680
If you're going to rewrite every
single cell, isn't it gonna hurt?

269
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:25,120
Oh, yeah.

270
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:26,560
It hurts.

271
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:38,000
SCREAMS IN AGONY

272
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:50,400
This working?

273
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,200
Martha!

274
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:55,120
Here's a list of instructions,
for when I'm human.

275
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:57,440
One. Don't let me hurt anyone.

276
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:58,800
We can't have that, but you
know what humans are like.

277
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:01,000
Two. Don't worry about the Tardis.

278
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:03,000
I will put it on Emergency
power so they cannot detect it.

279
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:04,680
Just let it hide away. Four...

280
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:10,600
No, wait a minute, three. No getting
involved in big historical events.

281
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,200
Four, you.

282
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:16,200
Don't let me abandon
you. And five...

283
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,480
TAPE REWINDS

284
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:21,000
But there was a meteor, what
am I supposed to do then?

285
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:23,160
And 23.

286
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:29,320
If anything goes wrong, if they find us,
Martha, then you know what to do. Open the watch.

287
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:31,960
Everything I am is
kept safe in there.

288
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,840
I've put a perception filter on it, so the
human me won't know. To him, it’s just a watch.

289
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:39,080
Don't open it unless you have to.

290
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:43,240
Cos once it's open, then The
Family will be able to find me.

291
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:45,400
It's all down to you, Martha.

292
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:46,880
Your choice.

293
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:51,160
Oh, and thank you.

294
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:57,480
I wish you'd come back.

295
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,160
KNOCK AT DOOR

296
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:04,760
You told me to come and collect
that book, sir. Good lad, yes.

297
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:07,880
The Definitive Account of
Mafeking by Aitchinson Price.

298
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:09,440
Where did I put it?

299
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:13,160
I wanted a word. Your marks
aren't quite good enough.

300
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,760
I'm top ten of my class.

301
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:17,960
Now be honest, Timothy.
You should be the very top.

302
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:22,040
You're a clever boy, you seem to
be hiding it. Where is that book?

303
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:27,720
I know why. Keeping your head low
avoids the mockery of your classmates.

304
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:31,640
No man should hide himself,
don't you think? Yes, sir.

305
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:36,760
If you're clever, be
proud of it. Use it!

306
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:39,920
ECHOING VOICE: Time Lord!

307
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:42,960
ECHOING VOICES WHISPER

308
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,360
'The secret lies
within. I'm trapped.'

309
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:49,160
'I'm caged inside the
cold metal and the dark.'

310
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,640
'But waiting. Always waiting.'

311
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:57,400
Fascinating details about
the siege. Are you all right?

312
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:59,440
Yes, sir. Fine, sir.

313
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:01,400
Right then. Good.

314
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:04,080
And remember, use
that brain of yours.

315
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:06,720
ECHOING VOICE: 'Power
of a Time Lord.'

316
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:11,520
You're not looking yourself.
Anything bothering you?

317
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:14,800
No, sir. Thank you, sir.

318
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:35,920
'You are not alone.
Keep me hidden.'

319
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:41,440
FEMALE VOICE: 'And infinite
flight, burn with light...'

320
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:48,400
BELL RINGS

321
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:53,280
Come along now.

322
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,480
'There is a trace.
But somehow scattered.

323
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:15,680
'The scent is confused.

324
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:19,440
'Nevertheless, we'd
best arm ourselves.'

325
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:21,440
Activate the soldiers.

326
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:39,160
That is my property!

327
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:42,360
You are trespassing on
my land! Who's in there?

328
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:46,000
Is it one of those idiot
boys from the school, is it?

329
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:51,760
Come on, let's be...
Well, how did you?

330
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,440
No! No! Help me!

331
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:59,120
Help me!

332
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:15,920
GIRL SCREAMS

333
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,960
Concentrate!

334
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:31,360
Hutchinson, excellent work.

335
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:33,720
Cease fire!

336
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:36,720
Good day, Headmaster. Your
crew's on fine form today!

337
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:38,680
Headmaster, we could do better.

338
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:42,160
Latimer's being deliberately
shoddy. I'm trying my best.

339
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:46,320
You need to be better! Those targets
are tribesmen, from the Dark Continent.

340
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:48,080
That's the problem, sir.

341
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:49,840
They only have spears.

342
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:54,160
Latimer takes it upon himself to
make us realise how wrong we are.

343
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:58,480
I hope, Latimer, that one day
you may have a just and proper war

344
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:01,200
in which to prove
yourself. Now resume firing.

345
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:09,520
SHELLS EXPLODE

346
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,920
MEN SHOUT

347
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:16,480
One minute past the hour.

348
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:18,200
It's now.

349
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:21,680
Hutchinson, this is
the time. It's now.

350
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:25,560
Stoppage! Immediate action!

351
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:28,600
Didn't I tell you,
sir? The boy's useless!

352
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:33,920
Permission to give Latimer a beating, sir?
It's your class, Mr Smith. Permission granted.

353
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:35,040
Come with me, oik!

354
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:40,800
HE SNIFFS

355
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:44,400
Anything the matter, Baines?

356
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:46,840
I thought...

357
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:49,600
No, sir. Nothing, sir.

358
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:53,520
As you were, Mr Smith.

359
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:57,600
Ah, Pemberton, Smythe, Wicks!

360
00:26:57,640 --> 00:27:00,440
Take post. Ah!

361
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:03,240
Nurse Redfern.

362
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:08,240
I'll give you back your journal
soon. No, you don't have to.

363
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:09,800
Excuse me, Mr Smith.

364
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:13,520
I was just thinking about
the day my husband was shot.

365
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:31,760
His name was Oliver. He died
at the battle of Spion Kop.

366
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:35,120
We were childhood sweethearts.

367
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:38,480
But, you see, I was angry with
the Army, for such a long time.

368
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:40,080
You still are.

369
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:44,600
I find myself at school,
watching boys learn how to kill.

370
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:48,480
Isn't discipline good for them? Does
it have to be military discipline?

371
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:53,760
If there's another war, those boys won't find
it so amusing. Well, Great Britain's at peace.

372
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:56,320
Long may it reign.

373
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:07,360
All those images of mud and wire.

374
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:09,640
You told of a shadow,

375
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:12,400
a shadow falling
across the entire world.

376
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:15,080
Then we can be
thankful it's not true.

377
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:20,160
I'll admit mankind doesn't need
warfare and bloodshed to prove itself.

378
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:24,640
Everyday life can provide honour and valour
and... Let's hope from now on, this...

379
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:28,640
this country can find its
heroes in smaller places.

380
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,760
In the most...

381
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:38,720
ordinary of...

382
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:41,400
of deeds.

383
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:53,680
SHE SCREAMS

384
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:07,680
BABY CRIES

385
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:09,280
Are you all right?

386
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:10,960
Lucky.

387
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:13,880
That was luck?

388
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:19,240
Nurse Redfern, might I invite you
to the village dance this evening?

389
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:23,080
As my guest? You extraordinary man!

390
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:29,400
Oh, it's all becoming clear now!

391
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:33,960
The Doctor is the man you'd like to be,
doing impossible things with cricket balls.

392
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:36,440
Well, I've discovered
a talent, that's true.

393
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:40,520
But The Doctor has an eye for the ladies.
The devil! A girl in every fireplace.

394
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:44,600
Ah, now there I have to
protest, Joan. That is hardly me.

395
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:47,480
Says the man dancing
with me tonight.

396
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:50,280
That scarecrow's all askew.

397
00:29:55,800 --> 00:30:00,440
Ever the artist. Where did you learn
to draw? Gallifrey. Is that in Ireland?

398
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:04,400
Yes. It must be. You're not Irish?

399
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:08,680
No. My father, Sidney, was
a watchmaker from Nottingham.

400
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:12,120
And my mother, Verity, was...

401
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:16,400
Erm, well, she was
a nurse, actually.

402
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:20,040
Oh, we make such good
wives. Really? Right.

403
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:21,640
Yes!

404
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:24,240
Well, my work is done!

405
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:28,440
What d'you think? A masterpiece.
I've all sorts of skills today.

406
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:43,600
Can I see?

407
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:50,280
Oh, goodness.

408
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:52,240
Do I look like that?

409
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:54,160
You sure that's not me?

410
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:56,760
Definitely this
page. Do you like it?

411
00:30:56,800 --> 00:31:00,720
You've made me far too beautiful.
Well, that's how I see you.

412
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:06,480
Widows aren't meant to be beautiful.
The world would rather we stopped.

413
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,640
Is that fair?

414
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:12,720
That we stop?

415
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:17,440
That's not fair at all.

416
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:36,160
I've never... Um...

417
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:43,960
DOOR OPENS

418
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:48,160
Martha! What have I told you
about entering unannounced!

419
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:52,160
Wasn't on the list!

420
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:59,320
TAPE REWINDS

421
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:01,840
Four, you.

422
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,680
Don't let me abandon you.

423
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:05,360
That's no good!

424
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:08,720
What about what you didn't
tell me? What about women?

425
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:11,360
Oh, no, you didn't think of that.

426
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:13,920
What the hell am I supposed to do?

427
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,320
Thank you.

428
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:21,160
You had to, didn't you?

429
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:23,440
Had to fall in love with a human.

430
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,560
And it wasn't me.

431
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:31,000
WOMAN: 'Darkness is coming! DOCTOR: 'Keep
me away from the false and empty man. '

432
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:36,080
MAN: The last of the Timelords. The
last of that wise and ancient race.

433
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:37,440
WOMAN'S VOICE: '...
the faces of men... '

434
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:01,320
THEY SNIFF

435
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:13,920
Who's that playing silly
beggars? Nearly broke me neck!

436
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:16,200
Who's that, then?

437
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:18,080
Is it you, Saul?

438
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:27,640
SHE SCREAMS

439
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:31,640
I don't understand.

440
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:34,560
It's Mr Clark, isn't it?

441
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:37,440
What have I done wrong?

442
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:42,760
Nothing at all.

443
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:45,280
In fact,

444
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:47,680
you're just what we need, girl.

445
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:49,600
She works at the school.

446
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:54,480
And whatever's happening seems to
be centred around that establishment.

447
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:57,760
The faintest of traces but
they all lead back there...

448
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:01,440
'It's Baines, isn't it?'

449
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,480
This isn't very funny, sir.

450
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:06,240
Shut up. Stop talking, cease
and desist, there's a good girl!

451
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:11,080
Mother of Mine is
dying to meet you.

452
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:18,160
And here she is.

453
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:20,800
Stop mocking me, sir. No!

454
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:24,160
Mother of Mine just needs a shape.

455
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:27,520
We go through shapes so very fast.

456
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:30,040
Yours is perfectly adequate,

457
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:35,720
Mother of Mine,

458
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:37,800
embrace her.

459
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:46,520
You look wonderful.

460
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:50,960
You'd best give me some
warning, can you actually dance?

461
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:54,640
Um, I'm not certain.

462
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:57,320
There's a surprise.

463
00:34:57,360 --> 00:35:01,320
Is there anything you're
certain about? Yes.

464
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:02,800
Yes.

465
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:17,320
What are you standing
there for? SHE SNIFFS

466
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:19,160
You all right?

467
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,080
I must have a cold coming on.

468
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:25,520
I keep thinking about them
but I don't know what to do.

469
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:28,200
About who? Mr Smith and Matron.

470
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:32,880
Cos it's never gonna last. He's
going to leave in a few weeks. Why?

471
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:37,840
His contract comes to an end and she's
gonna be heartbroken. Leave for where?

472
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:40,520
All sorts of places.

473
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:44,080
I wish I could tell you. But
it's complicated. In what way?

474
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:46,320
I just can't.

475
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:48,440
It sounds so interesting.

476
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:50,520
Tell me. Tell me now.

477
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:55,400
Would you like some tea?

478
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:56,000
Yes thanks.

479
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:59,480
I could put a nice bit
of gravey in the pot.

480
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,000
And some mutton.

481
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:03,440
Or sardines and
jam, how about that?

482
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:08,120
I like the sound of that. Right.

483
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:09,320
Hold on a tick.

484
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:34,320
They've found us! It's
ridiculous. I warned you.

485
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:38,160
They've found us and I've seen
them, they look like people, like us!

486
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:39,680
You've got to open the watch.

487
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:44,800
Where is it?

488
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:46,800
Oh, my God, where's it gone?

489
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:50,880
What are you talking about? You had
a watch, a fob watch, right there.

490
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:53,840
I don't remember. What
concern is it of yours?

491
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:55,520
But we need it!

492
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:58,840
Doctor, we're hiding from
aliens, and they've got jenny!

493
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:01,840
They've possessed her or
copied her or something!

494
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:04,760
You've got to tell me,
where's the watch? Oh! I see!

495
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:07,080
Cultural differences.

496
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:10,520
It must be confusing for you.

497
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:14,240
Martha, this is
what we call a story.

498
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:17,760
Oh, you complete...

499
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:21,520
This is not you. This is 1913!

500
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:23,320
Good. This is 1913.

501
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:26,800
I'm sorry, I'm really sorry, but
I've got to snap you out of this.

502
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:29,960
Martha! Wake up! You're coming
back to the TARDIS with me.

503
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,080
How dare you? I won't go
anywhere with an insane servant!

504
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:37,400
Martha, you are dismissed! You will
leave these premises immediately!

505
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:39,920
The nerve of it!
The absolute cheek!

506
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:44,680
You think I'm a fantasist, what about her?
The funny thing is, you did have a fob watch.

507
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:46,880
Right there. Don't you remember?

508
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:51,560
Oh, sorry.

509
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:53,000
Sorry.

510
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:55,160
Martha?!

511
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:59,480
Not now, Tim, busy!

512
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:12,360
Mr Smith?

513
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,120
No-one home.

514
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:18,840
The maid was definitely
hiding something.

515
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:21,520
A secret around this Mr Smith.

516
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:24,920
We've both scented him. He
was plain and simple human.

517
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:29,360
Maybe he knows
something. Where is he?

518
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:36,480
She's infatuated. You're a dangerous man.
You've taken my arm in public. I'm very scared.

519
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:40,160
Spare a penny for the
veterans of the Crimea, sir?

520
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:42,680
Yes, of course. There you are.

521
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:59,520
Ladies and gentlemen, please
take your partners for a waltz.

522
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:13,520
You CAN dance!

523
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:16,320
Quite surprised myself!

524
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:18,800
Sorry!

525
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:30,160
I think this might help.

526
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:36,880
That makes it easy, Son of Mine. Because
Daughter of Mine is already there.

527
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:38,960
We're invited to the dance.

528
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:47,200
Oh. Staff entrance, I think, Miss.

529
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:49,840
Yeah, well, think again, mate.

530
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:10,400
Please, don't. Not again.

531
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:13,640
He's different from any other
man you've ever met, right?

532
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:19,920
Yes. And sometimes he says these strange things,
like people and places you've never heard of?

533
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:21,720
But it's deeper than that.

534
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:27,240
Sometimes, when you look in his eyes, you know,
you just know, that there's something else in there.

535
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:30,080
Something hidden.

536
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:34,000
Behind the eyes, something
hidden away. In the dark.

537
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:36,320
I don't know what you mean.

538
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:37,720
Yes, you do.

539
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:46,000
I don't mean to be rude, but the awful thing
is, it doesn't even matter what you think.

540
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:49,280
But you're nice, and you're lucky.

541
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:51,800
I just want to say sorry
for what I'm about to do.

542
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:54,600
Oh, now really, Martha.

543
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:57,680
This is getting out of
hand. I insist you leave.

544
00:40:57,720 --> 00:41:00,160
Do you know what this is?

545
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:01,520
Name it.

546
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:03,640
Go on. Name it.

547
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:06,880
John, what is that
silly thing? John?

548
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:18,360
You're not john Smith.

549
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:20,840
You're called The Doctor.

550
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:23,480
The man in your journal, he's real.

551
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:25,200
He's you.

552
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:30,840
Evening all. Spare a penny, sir?

553
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:32,640
I didn't spare YOU.

554
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:34,680
HE SCREAMS

555
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:57,800
You will be silent! All of you!

556
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:00,920
I said silence!

557
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:03,080
Mr Clark? What's going on?

558
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:07,760
EVERYBODY SCREAMS

559
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:11,080
Mr Smith, forget everything I
told you. Don't say anything.

560
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:13,680
We asked for SILENCE!

561
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:17,200
Now then.

562
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:21,120
We have a few
questions for Mr Smith.

563
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:24,120
No, better than that.

564
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:27,560
The teacher. He's The Doctor!

565
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:30,720
I heard them talking.
You took human form?

566
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:33,880
I was born human,
as were you, Baines!

567
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:36,560
And jenny, and you, Mr Clark.

568
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:39,000
What is going on? This is madness!

569
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:43,120
Ooh, and a human brain,
too. Simple, thick and dull!

570
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:45,000
But he's no good like this.

571
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:47,200
We need a Time Lord.

572
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:49,000
Easily done.

573
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:56,600
Change back. I don't know
what you mean. Change back!

574
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:59,320
I literally do not know...

575
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:02,400
Get off! She's your friend.

576
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:07,520
Doesn't this scare you enough to
change back? I don't know what you mean!

577
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:12,320
Wait a minute. The maid told
me about Smith and the Matron.

578
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:14,600
That woman, there.
Then let's have YOU!

579
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:20,760
Have you enjoyed it,
Doctor? Being human?

580
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:24,480
Has it taught you wonderful things?
Are you better, richer, wiser?

581
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:27,000
Then let's see you answer this.

582
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,480
Which one of them do
you want us to kill?

583
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:34,480
Maid or Matron?

584
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:36,880
Your friend...

585
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:40,920
or your lover? Your choice!

586
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:36,920
We are the Family of Blood.

587
00:44:45,120 --> 00:44:47,560
Save us. I am not The Doctor.

588
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:51,720
He was like the storm in the heart
of the sun. He's ancient and forever.

589
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:55,840
He burns at the centre of time and
he can see the turn of the universe.
