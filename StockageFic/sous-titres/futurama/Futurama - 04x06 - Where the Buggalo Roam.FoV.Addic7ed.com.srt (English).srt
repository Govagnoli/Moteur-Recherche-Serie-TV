00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:09,350
Futurama [4x06] - Where The Buggalo Roam - CiWaN

2
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:45,592
Yes?
Hi, Dad! It's me and my coworkers.

3
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:49,116
Open up, Leo.
It's Amy and her weirdoes.

4
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:52,158
Howdy, friends! Welcome to Mars!

5
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:58,352
Thanks for inviting us.
I've never been to a Mars Day barbecue.

6
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:01,910
Mars Day better than Earth Day.
Dump trash anywhere.

7
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:05,550
Big, empty planet.
Okay! Make yourselves at home.

8
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:07,631
Don't mind if I already did.

9
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:11,076
Do you have any more
Dom Perignon bubble bath?

10
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:13,629
There was only enough
to fill the tub halfway.

11
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,516
Quite a large ranch you have.

12
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:24,673
17.9 billion acres. We own
entire Western Hemisphere.

13
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:28,150
That the best hemisphere.
It's the same on Earth.

14
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:34,355
Here is most number one
product. The mighty Buggalo.

15
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:38,399
Used for everything. Meat, milk.
Their shells make rowboats.

16
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,637
I broke your television!

17
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:43,514
It must take forever to brand them.

18
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:49,198
Not really. We own so much, it easier
to brand everything that not ours.

19
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,671
Please don't do that.

20
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:56,279
Hey! Betsy!

21
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:02,311
This is my sweet Betsy. I raised
her from a larva that ate my sweater.

22
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:07,190
We going to eat her at Amy's wedding.
If she ever get married.

23
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,078
Dad! Gleesh!

24
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:12,118
Don't say that when
you meet my boyfriend.

25
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:15,955
Oh, that right. We get to
spend time with this Mr. Kif.

26
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:19,351
I hope he's a nice man
who can make grandchildren.

27
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,956
This not a parallel universe
where you get younger.

28
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:36,352
Remember, the quickest way to a
girl's bed is through her parents.

29
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:41,878
Have sex with them, and you're in.
I'm nervous about meeting her family.

30
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:44,998
That's natural.
You're meek and uninteresting.

31
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:47,799
You've gotten by
on my leftover charisma.

32
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:50,520
Scrounging off it,
like a tiny parasite.

33
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:51,999
I hope they like me.

34
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:56,073
Why wouldn't they? Yes, I know.
Tiny, meek, uninteresting.

35
00:02:56,240 --> 00:03:00,518
Spare me your tedious story, Kif.
And above all, have fun!

36
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,798
Get on down!

37
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:11,633
Oh, yeah! Drop another barnyard
bomb on us, Vanilla Corn!

38
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:14,758
Yo, fool! It's Mix-Master Festus.

39
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,352
So, what's Mars Day about?

40
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:34,559
It commemorate the day when
our ancestor, Sir Reginald Wong...

41
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,995
Bought Mars from stupid natives.

42
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:39,355
How can you call them stupid?

43
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:43,957
They sell whole planet for one bead.
Sound stupid to me.

44
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,189
That is stupid!

45
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:49,990
I can't believe you laugh at
exploiting a proud, bead-Loving people.

46
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,878
Lighten up. It's funny.

47
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:54,634
Of course.
But you don't have to laugh!

48
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:59,829
No. Not on your parents' planet.

49
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,992
Glad to see you've come
back to the country.

50
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:05,196
It's where the flavor is.

51
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,710
RJ, this is my boyfriend, Kif.

52
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:11,111
This wimp?
You've gone a long way, baby.

53
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,431
Cigarette, partner?
Oh, I don't...

54
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:19,830
I haven't even lit it yet.
Oh. Is it lit now?

55
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,479
Yep.

56
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:25,109
You're pathetic.

57
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:29,915
Host man. Host woman.
I'm having a wonderful time!

58
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:36,110
You here five hours, already you tear
up couch and fill pool with shrimp!

59
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:38,714
Not bad for a city boy, huh?

60
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:43,317
By the way, I took the liberty
of fertilizing your caviar.

61
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:59,159
Relax.
I'm sure my parents will love you.

62
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:04,519
When I get nervous, I can't
control my camouflage reflex.

63
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:08,639
Oh, dear. Oh, goodness.
Oh, odds and bodkins.

64
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:12,190
I'll have a thorax and feelers.
You want salad?

65
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,554
Yuck!

66
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:16,154
Mom? Dad? You remember Kif.

67
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:21,110
I have instant dislike of him.
Too scrawny to father grandchildren.

68
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,953
He's not scrawny,
he's just small-Boned.

69
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:26,190
Actually, I don't have bones.

70
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:29,318
I'm supported by
fluid-Filled bladders that...

71
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:33,439
You a big, squishy wuss.
Amy should date real man. Like him!

72
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:40,235
I can be manly too.
I think I'll light up a smoke.

73
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,752
Wrong way.

74
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,599
Smooth.

75
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,312
Look on the bright side.

76
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:53,234
My parents left after you passed out,
so they didn't see you barf.

77
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:58,633
Now they'll never think I'm manly
enough to date their daughter.

78
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,511
It's okay, Kif.

79
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,560
I'll go get you a tissue from your tote.

80
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:07,837
Hey there, Amy.
Like you to meet my buddy, Joe.

81
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,471
Sorry I'm late. My pool game
ran long at the jazz club.

82
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,828
Kids love him.

83
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:21,276
What's that weird sound?

84
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:26,829
Dust storm! Oh, dust storm!
Everybody into house.

85
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,310
Hurry before we die.
And wipe your damn feet!

86
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:36,156
Phew. Everyone okay?
No one considering lawsuit?

87
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:39,312
Mm. I might have mental anguish.

88
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:43,109
I'm friends with every judge here.
I'm okay, then.

89
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:46,670
Storm dying down.
Check if Buggalo herd is okay.

90
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:54,239
Oh!

91
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:57,915
Where are the Buggalo?
Rustled under cover of storm!

92
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:01,595
We ruined!
No!

93
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:04,949
Don't worry, Daddy. It'll be okay.

94
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,190
Oh, really? Who gonna save us?

95
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,272
One-Eye? Lobster mooch?
Drunken garbage can?

96
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:14,149
This sounds like a job for...
Lt. Kif Kroker!

97
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,912
All right, then.

98
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:27,476
Those Buggalo were what made
Wong family so rich and powerful.

99
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:30,473
Oh, Inez, we damn stolen!
We ruined!

100
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:32,119
Okay, I want a divorce.

101
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:35,272
Mom! Dad! Don't ask me to choose!

102
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:39,359
They're not your parents. I'm not your
sister. And that's not your golf cart.

103
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,158
Aw.

104
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:48,028
Everybody calm down.
Kif promised to catch the rustlers.

105
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:57,912
Mrs. Wong, could I borrow a neckerchief?

106
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,958
My plan is to take the
remaining Buggalo...

107
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,839
And lead them on a tough cattle drive.

108
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,310
When rustlers attack,
I'll make a citizen's arrest.

109
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:12,233
Sounds dangerous.
Someone could get killed.

110
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:15,358
Fry? Leela? Bender? I
want you to go with him.

111
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:16,919
Oh, man.

112
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:22,275
Don't worry, Mr. And Mrs. Wong.
I'll get your cattle back, or die trying.

113
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:23,429
We can't lose!

114
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:28,116
No, it's too risky! You don't have
to do this to prove you're a man.

115
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:29,429
Oh, yes, he does!

116
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:32,437
Here are your mounts.

117
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,833
She's got a fine coat.

118
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,788
We need Buggalo to lure the rustlers.
How many are left?

119
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:42,554
Betsy's the only one left.

120
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:45,757
She was curled up in my
hamper when the storm hit.

121
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,035
Ooh. Oh.

122
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:49,316
Aw, she likes you.

123
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:55,269
Saddle up, men! We got some
no-Good rustlers to catch!

124
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:05,830
<i>We got a right to pick a
little fiight With rustlers...</i>

125
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,276
<i>Somebody wants to pick a fiight
with us He better bite my ass...</i>

126
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,873
Yee-Ha!

127
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:16,114
Wow! Look at that! Olympus Mons! The
tallest volcano in the solar system.

128
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:18,236
Where?
Right in front of you.

129
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,118
Oh. Oh!

130
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:23,477
We'll camp at the top.
The rustlers will spot us.

131
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:24,629
Where?

132
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:30,237
And even though the computer
was off and unplugged...

133
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:34,871
An image stayed on the screen.
It was...

134
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,315
The Windows logo!

135
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:40,711
That's not scary!
It is if you're a printer!

136
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:45,670
Okay, my turn to tell a ghost story.
Once, there was this woman driving...

137
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:49,594
Hook on the hand!
Okay, I've got one. This family...

138
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:50,954
Man in the attic!

139
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:54,669
Mr. Know-It-All-About-Something,
finally! Tell a story.

140
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,353
With pleasure.

141
00:09:56,520 --> 00:10:02,072
Once, not far from here,
four people set out on a cattle drive.

142
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:05,596
Bored robot kills Fry with a hammer!
Sorry, go on.

143
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:09,436
While they sat helplessly
around the campfire...

144
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:13,309
A demented, lunatic,
libertarian zombie snuck up...

145
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:15,198
Surprise!

146
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,351
Amy, what are you doing here?

147
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:22,876
I forgot to give you something.
Oh. What?

148
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:30,352
Is that your camouflage reflex,
or are you just happy to see me?

149
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:34,790
I love it out here, Amy.
I feel so manly.

150
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:40,239
I have a blister, I spit, and,
of course, I tell no one my feelings.

151
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:42,630
But you still have them?
Yes.

152
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:46,236
But I keep them inside until
I can write them in my diary.

153
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:50,234
Ah, it's a wonderful night.
It sure is.

154
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:53,995
I could lie beside you,
staring at the sky, all night.

155
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,673
I can't.
Ooh.

156
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:04,590
What's that?
Maybe we just made love.

157
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:10,430
The Buggalo are in the crater!

158
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:13,114
The rustlers must have seen me and ran!

159
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:16,875
Oh, Kif. You're so brave!
Sh. They'll hear us.

160
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:23,036
Okay, the dynamite's in place.

161
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,475
There's no other way to do it?

162
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:28,950
Only if your parents have
thousands of helicopters.

163
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,793
Actually...
Too late! This is more fun!

164
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:39,909
Kif, you did it! How did
you know dynamite would work?

165
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:43,629
I took a seminar in ejecting
chickens from a sand dune.

166
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,552
The principle is essentially the same.

167
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:51,191
Hey, it's that "barbecue's over"
sound again!

168
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,839
Sandstorm!

169
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,634
We're in the eye of the storm!
Where?

170
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,678
What's that?

171
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,277
Oh, my gosh!
Who are they?

172
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,909
We are the native Martians.

173
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,430
I didn't know Buggalo could fly.

174
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:24,353
Those who revere Mother
Mars can fly them.

175
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:27,159
Only they shall have Buggalo.
They're us.

176
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:31,154
But your Martian-Ness,
these Buggalo aren't yours.

177
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:33,356
They belong to the Wong family.

178
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:37,752
You mean family that took all
land and gave us a lousy bead?

179
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:40,070
Uh-Huh. Amy Wong. And you are?

180
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:44,074
Mad at Wong family! We plan to
ruin them by stealing Buggalo.

181
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,879
But now we take girl instead.

182
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:50,516
Wait! I'm too rich to be kidnapped!

183
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:53,592
Amy! No!

184
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:57,554
Don't worry, Kif.

185
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:02,396
I'm sure some other beautiful rich
girl will fall in love with you.

186
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:20,476
Hooray! You bring back cattle!

187
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:24,633
Yes. But I'm afraid I've
got some bad news as well.

188
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:28,031
Let Amy tell us.
That way it soften the blow.

189
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:31,392
Why Amy being so quiet?

190
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:34,157
Well... That is...

191
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:43,157
Oh, no! Martians kidnap Amy!

192
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,710
It them.
They no use good grammar.

193
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:50,270
I'll get your daughter back.
Forget it, squishy.

194
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:52,670
You lose her. You done enough.

195
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:57,072
This time we get most decorated
lawman in the whole universe!

196
00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:00,437
You mean...?
Oh, no, please, I beg you. For the...

197
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:05,799
I am the man with no name.
Zapp Brannigan, at your service.

198
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:09,675
Please, we need you go
get our daughter back!

199
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:15,153
I'll clean up Kif's mess. I shall go
bargain with the Martians personally.

200
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:18,835
Your gasps intrigue me.
Martians have no land.

201
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,629
They been encouraged to live
on reservation underground.

202
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,870
No one ever dare go there.

203
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:28,999
This mission is very dangerous!
Someone's sure to be killed!

204
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:33,153
Fry? Leela? Bender?
Damn you, old man!

205
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:42,349
Aw, look. Betsy followed you, Kif.

206
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:47,352
I didn't realize you were bringing
your girlfriend, lieutenant.

207
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:49,670
She won't leave me alone.

208
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:53,913
Did I say girlfriend?
She sounds more like a wife.

209
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:05,916
Behold! The stone face of Mars!
Hm.

210
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:10,710
The only entrance to the reservation.
What about the great stone ass?

211
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:13,633
But it's on the other
side of the planet.

212
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:18,629
Noseward, ho!

213
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:41,073
I am Singing Wind.
Chief of the Martian tribe.

214
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:43,310
Take me to your leader.

215
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:46,633
Moving along.
Why you trespass on our land?

216
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:49,075
To negotiate Amy Wong's release.

217
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:54,075
And just to clarify, land is
the stuff that has sky over it.

218
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:02,631
They have respect for the planet.
Cynthia used to drink Slurm.

219
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:07,073
We'll give girl when
we get planet surface.

220
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:09,754
How do we know she's alive?
I'm fine.

221
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:13,754
Sh. Don't weaken our bargaining power.
What if you give her up

222
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:16,798
And we carve presidents
in your mountain?

223
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:20,509
You waste words. We want
land that was taken from us.

224
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:22,989
Actually, you traded it for a bead.

225
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:26,596
Tribe suffer heap big buyer's remorse.
We want land!

226
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:29,991
My people are people of law.
And that law is:

227
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:31,559
No backsies.

228
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:35,030
The time for stupid statements is over.

229
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:40,592
Oh, boy.

230
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:51,675
Oh, oh, oh! My eye!

231
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:04,036
Ma! Pa! Our precious ranch!

232
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:07,153
Oof. Aiee! Ow.

233
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:19,839
Amy! No! It's too windy!

234
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:28,200
Stay calm, dearest! I'll save you!

235
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:34,559
Kif! You're flying Betsy!
Need a lift?

236
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,119
Oh! Oh, oh.

237
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:40,475
Great Mother Mars! He has the gift.

238
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,239
Yeah, Kif!
All right!

239
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:50,989
Kroker, that was one
Brannigan-Esque feat of heroism.

240
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:54,914
We misjudged you, green one.
You fly the Buggalo like us.

241
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:57,355
You have reverence for Mother Mars.

242
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:02,230
Let there be peace between us.
Yes. Let us smoke-Em peace pipe.

243
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,799
Smoke-Em?

244
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,189
Here, take.

245
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:10,828
No thanks. I'm on the peace patch.

246
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,788
You must smoke peace pipe, peacefully.
Or we'll kill you.

247
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:17,838
Well, it's just really
that I don't feel...

248
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,353
Don't be a chicken.

249
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:23,479
Teenagers all smoke,
and they seem pretty on the ball.

250
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,796
Yeah!
Way to suck it!

251
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:34,112
Hey, I'm smoking! I'm the greatest!

252
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,318
Oh, monkey trumpets!

253
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:46,550
You coughed at our offer of peace,
so you must die.

254
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:51,271
The bead used to crush our dreams
shall be used to crush your bones.

255
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,317
I don't have bones.

256
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:57,155
I'm supported by a system of
fluid-Filled bladders that... Ah!

257
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:01,068
Oh, oh, oh my. Oh.

258
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:04,232
That's the bead you
traded your land for?

259
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:07,597
It's a huge diamond!
It must be worth a fortune!

260
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,239
Really?

261
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:21,910
Oh, chief, you've made me the
happiest girl in the world!

262
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:25,590
If you want your land,
we could trade back for it.

263
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:29,230
Hm. We assumed our
ancestors were cheated...

264
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:32,358
Because they not have
concept of ownership.

265
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:37,913
So we can have the diamond?
No. We do have concept of ownership.

266
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:41,436
You can go. Sorry about
the rustling and kidnapping.

267
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:44,239
And your sacred land?
Land, schmand!

268
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,960
We don't want to live here.
It's a dump.

269
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:51,591
We'll buy new planet and act like
it's sacred. Who's gonna argue?

270
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,239
Nobody, that's who!

271
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:05,469
Kif flew Betsy, rescued me,
and made peace with the Martians.

272
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:07,437
He too much of a wimp.

273
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:10,797
Yeah. I'm sure it was all
Mr. Zapp Brannigan here.

274
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:13,474
Please, you give me too little credit.

275
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:18,599
Captain Brannigan, you're always
welcome at Rancho Zoidberg.

276
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:24,156
Money doesn't make good people!
No, sir!

277
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:31,796
Thanks for saving my life, Kif.
You're my hero.

278
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:35,953
Oh, you're kind.
But your parents still don't like me.

279
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:40,238
Well, gloviously. But if they
liked you, then I wouldn't.

280
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:43,437
Don't you know anything about girls?

281
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:58,593
"Dear diary, I just made
love for the second time."
