00:00:02,415 --> 00:00:06,328
<i>Futurama is brought to you
by Thompson 's Teeth...</i>

2
00:00:06,575 --> 00:00:10,614
<i>... the only teeth strong enough
to eat other teeth.</i>

3
00:00:16,815 --> 00:00:18,885
Insane in the Mainframe

4
00:00:41,375 --> 00:00:42,569
Good news, everyone.

5
00:00:42,775 --> 00:00:47,644
Today marks our friend Dr. Zoidberg's
1 0th year with Planet Express.

6
00:00:47,855 --> 00:00:51,052
- Huzzahs are in order.
- Huzzah.

7
00:00:51,255 --> 00:00:56,170
- Hooray for me! Hooray for Zoidberg!
- I'll now read the mandatory speech.

8
00:00:58,015 --> 00:01:01,644
"Dear Employee: Has it really been
5, 1 0 or 1 5 years?

9
00:01:01,855 --> 00:01:04,653
If not, disregard this
and get to work."

10
00:01:04,855 --> 00:01:08,404
Distribute token of appreciation
and applaud.

11
00:01:09,015 --> 00:01:13,691
Look! Coupons! I can get
two oil changes for the price of one!

12
00:01:13,895 --> 00:01:16,967
Now if I could only afford the one.
And the car.

13
00:01:17,175 --> 00:01:20,133
Ah, the years. So many memories...

14
00:01:20,335 --> 00:01:24,169
...so many strange fluids
gushing out of patients' bodies.

15
00:01:24,375 --> 00:01:27,492
Yes, yes. Now here's
your pension statement.

16
00:01:27,695 --> 00:01:31,768
It's empty because you haven't paid
into it, you dummy.

17
00:01:31,975 --> 00:01:34,773
You kept track of it all these years.

18
00:01:34,975 --> 00:01:39,412
I'm boned. I haven't paid either.
What'll I do when I retire?

19
00:01:39,615 --> 00:01:42,971
- I thought you were retired.
- I don't see you planning for old age.

20
00:01:43,175 --> 00:01:46,724
I got plans. I'm gonna turn
my on/off switch to off.

21
00:01:46,935 --> 00:01:51,406
I'm gonna take action. It's time
to check my retirement fund.

22
00:01:52,335 --> 00:01:54,644
Damn! Still only 1 00 dollars.

23
00:01:54,855 --> 00:01:59,645
A penny saved is a penny earned. Also,
I need athlete's foot cream for my face.

24
00:01:59,855 --> 00:02:02,733
He's right.
I must start investing wisely.

25
00:02:04,135 --> 00:02:06,251
Well, down to my last lottery ticket.

26
00:02:08,135 --> 00:02:11,571
Cherry. Cherry!

27
00:02:11,775 --> 00:02:13,493
Mule. Crud!

28
00:02:13,695 --> 00:02:18,166
You got six bucks left to retire on.
I recommend Tender Vittles.

29
00:02:20,775 --> 00:02:23,369
You're opening a retirement
account for $6?

30
00:02:23,575 --> 00:02:28,968
I'm sure a wealthy mule farmer like you
knows we charge a $ 1 0 monthly fee.

31
00:02:29,175 --> 00:02:31,643
You gotta spend money to make money.

32
00:02:31,855 --> 00:02:35,404
Here you are.
Your account is now overdrawn by $4.

33
00:02:35,615 --> 00:02:38,891
I've seen lines move
faster in the sperm bank.

34
00:02:39,095 --> 00:02:41,893
That's for sure...
Roberto, is that you?

35
00:02:42,095 --> 00:02:44,609
Bender! Hey, man!

36
00:02:47,295 --> 00:02:51,527
- You old lunatic! How you been?
- Not bad. Not bad.

37
00:02:51,735 --> 00:02:54,807
Everybody on the floor!
This is a stickup!

38
00:02:56,975 --> 00:03:01,093
I'm okay too. I'm taking a Chinese
cooking class at the Learning Annex.

39
00:03:01,295 --> 00:03:05,004
- Cool. Can you give me a hand here?
- Sure thing, pal.

40
00:03:05,215 --> 00:03:09,606
Hey, you! Red! Quit watering
that plant and get the door!

41
00:03:10,575 --> 00:03:14,454
- Nice talking to you.
- Same here. You guys are all right.

42
00:03:14,655 --> 00:03:18,614
- Here's something for your trouble.
- Thanks, buddy!

43
00:03:22,175 --> 00:03:23,893
Freeze! You're under arrest!

44
00:03:24,095 --> 00:03:28,008
Shoot them in the back!
Quick, while they're not looking!

45
00:03:31,535 --> 00:03:35,733
Court is in session.
The Honorable Judge Whitey presiding.

46
00:03:35,935 --> 00:03:38,244
The charge is bank robbery.

47
00:03:38,455 --> 00:03:40,446
My caddie-chauffeur informs me...

48
00:03:40,695 --> 00:03:45,086
...that a bank is where people
put money that isn't invested right.

49
00:03:45,295 --> 00:03:50,289
Therefore, robbing a bank is tantamount
to that most heinous of crimes:

50
00:03:50,495 --> 00:03:52,167
Theft of money.

51
00:03:52,375 --> 00:03:57,688
As the surveillance camera for that
bank the judge was jawing about...

52
00:03:57,895 --> 00:04:01,251
...could you tell us what you
done seen that day?

53
00:04:01,455 --> 00:04:06,813
Well, let's see. My memory's a little
fuzzy, but it went exactly like this:

54
00:04:11,215 --> 00:04:14,093
Your Honor, I move
that I be disbarred...

55
00:04:14,295 --> 00:04:18,413
...for introducing this evidence
against my own clients.

56
00:04:18,975 --> 00:04:24,288
Mr. Fry, do you recognize the robot
hugging on you in this here hologram?

57
00:04:24,495 --> 00:04:26,929
I sure do! That's the real robber...

58
00:04:27,135 --> 00:04:31,413
...and I'll never forget his name as
long as I live. And that name is...

59
00:04:35,935 --> 00:04:40,053
Just give a name! You don't wanna
look stupid on Court TV.

60
00:04:40,255 --> 00:04:43,406
You're right. You're right. It was...

61
00:04:44,495 --> 00:04:48,693
Yes? What?
You say if I testify I'll be killed?

62
00:04:48,895 --> 00:04:51,011
Oh, it's for you.

63
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:57,567
And the other hamburger will also be
made of your lungs. So long, pal.

64
00:04:58,375 --> 00:05:02,607
I won't testify on grounds that my
organs will be chopped up into a patty.

65
00:05:02,815 --> 00:05:04,885
The 67th Amendment.

66
00:05:05,095 --> 00:05:09,885
I may be a simple, country chicken,
but I know when we're finger-licked.

67
00:05:10,095 --> 00:05:11,892
What if we plead insanity?

68
00:05:12,095 --> 00:05:15,610
A few months in an insane asylum?
I could do it on my head.

69
00:05:15,855 --> 00:05:18,449
If you start now,
it might help our case.

70
00:05:18,935 --> 00:05:23,133
What evidence do you offer to
support this new plea of insanity?

71
00:05:23,375 --> 00:05:28,733
- They done hired me to represent them.
- Insanity plea is accepted.

72
00:05:28,975 --> 00:05:34,129
Mr. Bender, I hereby commit you to the
asylum for criminally insane robots...

73
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:36,724
...until you are deemed cured.

74
00:05:36,935 --> 00:05:39,927
Yahoo! The system fails again!

75
00:05:40,175 --> 00:05:45,044
And Mr. Fry, I sentence you to the
home for criminally insane humans.

76
00:05:45,255 --> 00:05:50,534
That facility has been full since you
ruled being poor is a mental illness.

77
00:05:50,695 --> 00:05:53,892
Order! The only poor people
I want to hear about...

78
00:05:54,055 --> 00:05:56,410
...are those who tend to my pores
at the spa.

79
00:05:56,575 --> 00:05:59,487
Send them both to the robot loony bin
and let's go.

80
00:06:07,855 --> 00:06:08,890
Huh?

81
00:06:10,535 --> 00:06:14,084
Ow, my head! Ow, my feet!
Ow, my head! Ow, my feet!

82
00:06:14,295 --> 00:06:16,251
- Keep your chin up.
- Ow, my chin!

83
00:06:25,695 --> 00:06:29,005
I don't belong here.
This is for insane robots.

84
00:06:29,255 --> 00:06:32,691
Well, you meet half
the qualifications.

85
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:35,894
Oh, good! A physical!

86
00:06:36,095 --> 00:06:39,974
Once they examine my fragile,
pink body, they'll see I'm not a...

87
00:07:11,095 --> 00:07:12,210
What the...?

88
00:07:13,015 --> 00:07:15,006
I find that offensive!

89
00:07:21,295 --> 00:07:26,767
Greetings. I am Dr. Perceptron. Let me
give you something to help you relax.

90
00:07:29,135 --> 00:07:31,888
There's been a terrible mistake!
I'm human!

91
00:07:32,055 --> 00:07:35,764
See? I'm all squishy and flabby.
Also, I complain a lot.

92
00:07:35,975 --> 00:07:38,728
Yes, you do. You need to relax more.

93
00:07:38,895 --> 00:07:41,455
Terrific. Now, consider
the following:

94
00:07:41,695 --> 00:07:45,927
You were admitted to this robot
asylum. You must be a robot.

95
00:07:46,135 --> 00:07:48,285
Diagnosis complete.

96
00:07:48,495 --> 00:07:52,408
I do other human stuff. I age! See?

97
00:07:53,895 --> 00:07:57,285
I'm Nurse Ratchet.
Please come with me, won't you?

98
00:08:04,415 --> 00:08:08,886
We'll meet your roommate next.
His name is Malfunctioning Eddie.

99
00:08:09,095 --> 00:08:12,644
The car dealer?
I guess his prices really were insane.

100
00:08:12,855 --> 00:08:17,053
He's very excitable, so don't
say anything to surprise him.

101
00:08:19,495 --> 00:08:21,690
- Pleased to meet you.
- We've met.

102
00:08:21,895 --> 00:08:23,214
What?!

103
00:08:31,495 --> 00:08:36,808
I'm a pretty girl. I'm a pretty girl.
I'm a pretty girl.

104
00:08:37,055 --> 00:08:40,445
- Someone had a busy day!
- My roommate exploded.

105
00:08:40,615 --> 00:08:43,413
You gotta help me.
How can I prove I'm human?

106
00:08:43,615 --> 00:08:46,812
- You could drop dead.
- I don't wanna!

107
00:08:47,055 --> 00:08:49,728
- Hey. I believe you are a human.
- You do?

108
00:08:49,935 --> 00:08:53,610
They don't believe I'm a human either.
Name's Unit 201 3.

109
00:08:53,815 --> 00:08:55,646
Let me introduce you around.

110
00:08:56,335 --> 00:09:01,455
Fry, meet Norm. Still picking up
CIA transmissions on your teeth?

111
00:09:01,655 --> 00:09:04,249
They just won't stop!

112
00:09:04,495 --> 00:09:09,808
<i>The CIA cafeteria menu for the
week of May 1 5th is as follows:</i>

113
00:09:10,015 --> 00:09:12,973
<i>Monday, shepherd's pie...</i>

114
00:09:13,175 --> 00:09:14,210
Cuckoo.

115
00:09:14,615 --> 00:09:18,324
- Let me guess. He thinks he's Lincoln?
- He's supposed to.

116
00:09:18,535 --> 00:09:22,972
Problem is, he's got multiple
personalities. All of them Lincoln.

117
00:09:23,855 --> 00:09:26,972
I was born in 200 log cabins.

118
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:29,047
And this here is Frankie.

119
00:09:29,215 --> 00:09:32,810
He thinks he's a lunchroom worker.
So they put him here.

120
00:09:33,615 --> 00:09:36,288
- How's working the lunchroom?
- All right.

121
00:09:36,495 --> 00:09:37,689
Poor Frankie.

122
00:09:44,575 --> 00:09:46,008
Change places!

123
00:09:48,295 --> 00:09:51,492
I can't take much more of this.
I want out of here!

124
00:09:51,695 --> 00:09:55,813
Are you crazy? This is great.
Electroshock whenever you want...

125
00:09:55,975 --> 00:09:58,614
...two Lincolns for every Napoleon.

126
00:09:59,455 --> 00:10:02,015
Sweet light crude!

127
00:10:02,815 --> 00:10:06,649
But I'm not a robot! I don't like
having disks crammed into me.

128
00:10:06,855 --> 00:10:11,167
Unless they're Oreos, and only in
the mouth. Don't you see? I'll die!

129
00:10:11,375 --> 00:10:15,288
Quit your bellyaching
and take it like a robot.

130
00:10:16,095 --> 00:10:17,892
Change places!

131
00:10:23,335 --> 00:10:27,169
They say you're making strides
with your exploding problem.

132
00:10:27,335 --> 00:10:29,610
Well, the way I see it...

133
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:36,528
Get me out. I'd have starved if not
for that sick vending machine robot.

134
00:10:37,895 --> 00:10:39,408
Give me! Give me!

135
00:10:41,375 --> 00:10:44,367
Poor Fry. He's got the munchies
for freedom.

136
00:10:44,575 --> 00:10:47,169
We're trying.
We petitioned the governor...

137
00:10:47,335 --> 00:10:51,487
...but he doesn't want to appear soft
on those falsely imprisoned.

138
00:10:51,655 --> 00:10:55,648
At least I have friends on the outside.
Bender's been no help at all.

139
00:10:58,255 --> 00:10:59,847
No, seriously, I'm not.

140
00:11:00,055 --> 00:11:03,013
You should be more ashamed than usual.

141
00:11:03,215 --> 00:11:07,572
Lighten up, honey. I'm getting through
a difficult time using humor.

142
00:11:07,775 --> 00:11:12,132
Visiting hours are over.
Time for our medication disks.

143
00:11:12,335 --> 00:11:14,565
Help me! For God's sake, help me!

144
00:11:14,775 --> 00:11:20,407
Don't worry, Fry. I too once spent
a nightmarish time in a robot asylum.

145
00:11:20,655 --> 00:11:24,204
But now it's nearly over. So long.

146
00:11:28,335 --> 00:11:33,614
Thirty days, September, April, June.
Peanut butter. What am I gonna do?

147
00:11:33,895 --> 00:11:36,932
Oh, God! What? What? What is it now?

148
00:11:37,295 --> 00:11:41,208
- You are being released.
- Finally! Sweet justice!

149
00:11:41,375 --> 00:11:43,525
Sweet, juicy justice!

150
00:11:43,735 --> 00:11:47,523
- Not you. Him.
- Me? What a surprise!

151
00:11:50,855 --> 00:11:55,724
- Look! I barely exploded at all.
- We can control that with medication.

152
00:11:55,975 --> 00:12:00,412
Fry? Are we ready to
meet our new roommate?

153
00:12:04,575 --> 00:12:08,090
- Hi, Red!
- Roberto? What are you doing here?

154
00:12:08,295 --> 00:12:12,368
- I got busted robbing that bank again.
- Why the same bank twice?

155
00:12:12,575 --> 00:12:16,124
That first time was just to
case the joint and rob it a little.

156
00:12:16,415 --> 00:12:19,248
What's the matter? You scared?

157
00:12:20,575 --> 00:12:25,410
Noticeably? I'll say. Now stand back.
I gotta practice my stabbing.

158
00:12:25,695 --> 00:12:30,052
No! Please! Help! Stop it! Police!

159
00:12:30,295 --> 00:12:34,652
Hey, keep it down in there!
I'm tuning my banjo!

160
00:12:34,855 --> 00:12:40,213
Jeez, Red. Quit cowering.
You call yourself a robot?

161
00:12:41,695 --> 00:12:43,253
I'm not a robot!

162
00:12:43,415 --> 00:12:45,804
I'm not a robot!

163
00:12:49,895 --> 00:12:53,604
In answer to your question, Hermes,
yes, your friend is cured.

164
00:12:53,855 --> 00:12:55,652
Oh! Thank God!

165
00:12:55,975 --> 00:12:59,570
Notice he no longer suffers
delusions of humanity.

166
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:05,407
Affirmative. I feel nothing.
I am a robot. Beep, beep, beep...

167
00:13:05,615 --> 00:13:10,973
You've made a terrible mistake. He's a
human being. Not a machine! Oh, Fry!

168
00:13:11,175 --> 00:13:13,530
Beep-beep-beep-beep-beep...

169
00:13:13,775 --> 00:13:17,404
<i>Gonna sing a little tale
About a battle called Waterloo</i>

170
00:13:17,735 --> 00:13:19,646
<i>Bonjour, y'all!</i>

171
00:13:23,935 --> 00:13:28,053
Fry, just because you think you're
a robot doesn't make you one.

172
00:13:28,255 --> 00:13:33,329
I think I'm a doctor, but that doesn't
make me a doctor. These clothes do.

173
00:13:33,535 --> 00:13:37,653
I must be a robot. Why else
would human women not date me?

174
00:13:37,855 --> 00:13:39,652
Oh, lots of reasons.

175
00:13:39,855 --> 00:13:41,607
Terminate noise exchange.

176
00:13:41,775 --> 00:13:46,212
It is time for you to ingest
sandwiches from my compartment.

177
00:13:51,295 --> 00:13:54,765
Here we go. Just a minute.

178
00:13:54,935 --> 00:13:58,007
<i>And down the stretch,
it's Daddy's Little Grandpa...</i>

179
00:13:58,215 --> 00:14:02,493
<i>... followed by Perennial Loser.
Bringing up the rear, it's Lasty!</i>

180
00:14:02,695 --> 00:14:05,209
- Come on, Lasty!
- Hey, Bender.

181
00:14:05,415 --> 00:14:09,044
Roberto! What a surprise
to see you in here!

182
00:14:09,295 --> 00:14:14,415
Especially because I didn't squeal.
Remember, I didn't squeal? Do you?

183
00:14:14,615 --> 00:14:18,130
Yeah. Now lie down and play dead.
And don't ham it up.

184
00:14:18,295 --> 00:14:21,048
Sure. Anything for you, buddy.

185
00:14:24,095 --> 00:14:27,087
Wait here, Bender.
I need to get a disguise.

186
00:14:36,535 --> 00:14:38,207
What's with the getup?

187
00:14:38,415 --> 00:14:43,284
I'm in disguise 'cause I wanna escape.
You in? Or do I gotta kill you?

188
00:14:43,495 --> 00:14:44,530
I'm in! I'm in!

189
00:14:44,895 --> 00:14:47,011
When were you planning
the breakout?

190
00:14:47,175 --> 00:14:50,884
I'm thinking, a few seconds ago.

191
00:14:51,775 --> 00:14:53,652
Quick! Let's keep escaping!

192
00:15:19,415 --> 00:15:22,168
Times two. Carry the one.

193
00:15:23,695 --> 00:15:26,255
Oh, you sad, worthless human.

194
00:15:28,135 --> 00:15:31,207
That was my anniversary
gift from LaBarbra!

195
00:15:31,415 --> 00:15:35,613
- Fear not, for I shall assist ye!
- Robots don't say "ye."

196
00:15:35,815 --> 00:15:40,570
Relax, mammal. My robotic software
shall meet your calculatory needs.

197
00:15:40,775 --> 00:15:42,174
What is this symbol?

198
00:15:42,375 --> 00:15:46,414
That's a plus sign, you loony!
Quit thinking you're a robot!

199
00:15:46,615 --> 00:15:48,765
I'll show ye.

200
00:15:56,775 --> 00:15:59,414
Stand back! I'm a tool-bot.

201
00:16:05,775 --> 00:16:10,849
You're not a tool-bot or a food-mo-tron.
You're not a robot of any kind.

202
00:16:11,055 --> 00:16:16,254
Yes, I am. I simply haven't discovered
my primary function yet.

203
00:16:16,455 --> 00:16:18,173
Okay. This has got to stop.

204
00:16:18,375 --> 00:16:22,812
I'll remind Fry of his humanity,
the way only a woman can.

205
00:16:23,015 --> 00:16:25,290
You're going to do his laundry?

206
00:16:25,495 --> 00:16:29,374
Fry, this is for you.

207
00:16:38,775 --> 00:16:40,891
- Beep.
- Oh, for God's sake!

208
00:16:44,855 --> 00:16:48,086
By a scallop's forelocks,
what's with all the beer?

209
00:16:48,255 --> 00:16:54,125
Alcohol fuels my power cells.
And, as a mighty robot, l...

210
00:16:54,375 --> 00:16:56,013
Beep.

211
00:16:58,335 --> 00:17:01,247
- Thanks for helping me escape.
- It was nothing.

212
00:17:01,415 --> 00:17:02,643
It was not nothing!

213
00:17:02,815 --> 00:17:06,410
I want to repay you.
Let me get you something in here.

214
00:17:08,455 --> 00:17:10,685
Hands up! This is a stickup again!

215
00:17:10,895 --> 00:17:15,173
Wow. Hitting the same place
three times? I admire your style.

216
00:17:15,375 --> 00:17:19,084
Give me the remaining dough,
the calendars and that pen.

217
00:17:19,295 --> 00:17:22,048
Tear it so most of the beads
are on my end!

218
00:17:22,215 --> 00:17:23,694
Police. You're busted!

219
00:17:23,895 --> 00:17:27,171
And don't try anything.
This glass is laser-proof.

220
00:17:28,095 --> 00:17:29,574
Fire lasers!

221
00:17:29,735 --> 00:17:32,249
Duck! Lasers!

222
00:17:32,895 --> 00:17:36,888
Come on! I got a place
where I like to hide after crimes.

223
00:17:41,255 --> 00:17:45,487
He looks like a little
insane drunken angel.

224
00:17:47,335 --> 00:17:50,372
Hey, everybody.
Meet my good pal, Roberto.

225
00:17:50,575 --> 00:17:52,611
- Hey, mon.
- Nice to meet you.

226
00:17:52,855 --> 00:17:55,608
- Come out with your hands up!
- Hostages!

227
00:18:00,415 --> 00:18:04,090
- Back off! I got hostages!
- Hooray! I'm helping!

228
00:18:04,295 --> 00:18:06,490
Do you have any better hostages?

229
00:18:06,695 --> 00:18:10,529
To show them who's crazy,
I'll execute some of you. You?

230
00:18:10,695 --> 00:18:14,085
Ouch! That's going to bleed
when my heart beats.

231
00:18:14,295 --> 00:18:17,492
- Wait! Take me first!
- Yes! Take her first!

232
00:18:17,695 --> 00:18:20,368
Shut up! Stop telling me
how to do this!

233
00:18:23,775 --> 00:18:25,208
Oh, the fear!

234
00:18:25,415 --> 00:18:29,044
I'm thinking of a number between one
and 1 0. Guess it, and you die first.

235
00:18:29,215 --> 00:18:31,888
- Go!
- Okay.

236
00:18:32,055 --> 00:18:36,845
- Fifty-six-ish?
- Fifty-six? Fifty-six?

237
00:18:37,015 --> 00:18:39,609
Man! Now that's all I can think about!

238
00:18:39,815 --> 00:18:43,444
I'm gonna kill you,
you no good, 56-ing...!

239
00:18:48,055 --> 00:18:51,730
Don't kill me! I'm coming down
with Stockholm Syndrome...

240
00:18:51,895 --> 00:18:53,010
...handsome.

241
00:18:54,375 --> 00:18:56,764
Halt, fellow robot!

242
00:18:57,335 --> 00:19:01,487
Hey, Red! You're just in time
to join the hostage situation.

243
00:19:01,695 --> 00:19:06,723
- Which side do you want to be on?
- The side that kicks your metal ass.

244
00:19:06,935 --> 00:19:09,495
Fry! Stay back! He's too powerful!

245
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:13,688
Negative, bossy meat creature.
I now know my primary function:

246
00:19:13,895 --> 00:19:17,251
I am a battle-droid, protecting
the weak from crazy robots.

247
00:19:17,415 --> 00:19:21,090
I'm not crazy! Don't call me crazy!
I'm just not user-friendly.

248
00:19:21,255 --> 00:19:24,565
Don't be a hero! It's not covered
by the health plan!

249
00:19:24,735 --> 00:19:28,933
Let's see how much of a robot
you really are!

250
00:19:36,055 --> 00:19:39,934
No knife can penetrate
my skin-tanium armor.

251
00:19:42,415 --> 00:19:47,284
Help! Help! He is a battle-droid!
Somebody help me!

252
00:19:48,095 --> 00:19:52,213
Mommy! I'm sorry I spilled
the transmission fluid, Mommy.

253
00:19:52,455 --> 00:19:56,448
No, no! Don't weld me
to the wall, Mommy!

254
00:20:07,775 --> 00:20:10,767
We're willing to listen
to your demands.

255
00:20:11,175 --> 00:20:14,611
Hey, baby. Wash that off
before you put it back.

256
00:20:14,815 --> 00:20:16,328
- Hooray!
- Bravo!

257
00:20:16,535 --> 00:20:17,729
You did it, Fry.

258
00:20:17,935 --> 00:20:21,245
Congratulations, buddy.
You're a credit to my race.

259
00:20:21,455 --> 00:20:23,013
It was nothing. l...

260
00:20:25,815 --> 00:20:30,127
Blood? Robots don't have blood.
I must be a...

261
00:20:30,335 --> 00:20:34,613
- A squid?
- A human! Oh, my God! I'm a human!

262
00:20:34,815 --> 00:20:35,804
Also good.

263
00:20:38,975 --> 00:20:40,772
Thanks for saving us, Fry.

264
00:20:41,815 --> 00:20:45,046
I'm gonna continue never washing
this cheek again.

265
00:20:45,215 --> 00:20:50,812
You may be wrapped in greasy skin, but
inside you have the heart of a robot.

266
00:20:51,055 --> 00:20:52,488
Thanks, Bender.

267
00:20:52,695 --> 00:20:56,085
Just like inside me,
I've got the heart of a human.

268
00:20:58,095 --> 00:20:59,653
What?

269
00:21:00,735 --> 00:21:02,487
What?
