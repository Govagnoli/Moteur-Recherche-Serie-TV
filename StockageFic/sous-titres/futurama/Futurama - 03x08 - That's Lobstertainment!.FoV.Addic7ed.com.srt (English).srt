1
00:00:07,215 --> 00:00:09,331
That's Lobstertainment

2
00:00:36,175 --> 00:00:39,531
So I says, "Super Collider?
I just met her."

3
00:00:41,855 --> 00:00:47,851
And then they built the Super Collider.
Thank you. You've been great.

4
00:00:48,735 --> 00:00:51,010
Humorbot 5.0, ladies and gentlemen.

5
00:00:51,215 --> 00:00:55,094
Our next standup's a veteran
of four comedy traffic schools.

6
00:00:55,255 --> 00:00:58,292
Give it way up for Bobcat Zoidberg!

7
00:00:58,495 --> 00:00:59,894
All right!

8
00:01:00,095 --> 00:01:01,813
- Yeah!
- All right!

9
00:01:02,775 --> 00:01:07,485
Earth. What a planet. On Earth,
you enjoy eating a tasty clam.

10
00:01:07,735 --> 00:01:11,614
On my planet,
clams enjoy eating a tasty you!

11
00:01:13,335 --> 00:01:18,409
Maybe I'm not loud enough. On Earth,
everybody is looking for a squid!

12
00:01:18,655 --> 00:01:21,374
On my planet...

13
00:01:22,775 --> 00:01:24,367
Reload.

14
00:01:25,015 --> 00:01:29,770
So these three parasitic worms
bore into a human's head.

15
00:01:30,335 --> 00:01:32,803
And they walk up to the bar
and then...

16
00:01:33,015 --> 00:01:36,166
Wait! Stop! I've got more!

17
00:01:41,255 --> 00:01:43,769
My whole life I worked on that act.

18
00:01:43,975 --> 00:01:47,604
- And they hated it.
- You're a crazy lobster doctor!

19
00:01:47,855 --> 00:01:51,768
- You shouldn't be a comedian!
- But comedy is in my valves.

20
00:01:51,975 --> 00:01:56,685
My Uncle Harold was a big star
back in the era of silent holograms.

21
00:01:56,895 --> 00:02:01,252
- Your uncle was Harold Zoid?
- This I cannot deny.

22
00:02:01,455 --> 00:02:05,767
Why, I've been a fan since back when
my hips were made of bone!

23
00:02:05,975 --> 00:02:09,331
As it happens,
I still have some of my original 78s.

24
00:03:05,535 --> 00:03:08,652
He's a lot funnier
than you could ever be.

25
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:13,690
Maybe, but perhaps if I wrote him
and asked for a few hundred pointers...

26
00:03:14,655 --> 00:03:20,366
This letter has to be very personal,
so I'm writing it in my own ink.

27
00:03:23,775 --> 00:03:27,370
<i>"Dear Uncle Zoid,
Greetings from your nephew.</i>

28
00:03:27,575 --> 00:03:30,214
<i>Norm and Sam and Sadie's boy?
Remember?</i>

29
00:03:30,455 --> 00:03:34,687
<i>Now I'm the most important doctor
at the company where I work.</i>

30
00:03:34,935 --> 00:03:37,608
<i>But my life is bereft of laughter. "</i>

31
00:03:37,815 --> 00:03:40,045
"I beg of you, Mr. Funny Uncle.

32
00:03:40,255 --> 00:03:44,214
Teach me the comedy business.
Sincerely, Zoidberg."

33
00:03:44,455 --> 00:03:46,286
Isn't that nice?

34
00:03:46,535 --> 00:03:52,087
- What's that scribble-di-gook?
- It's a letter from my rich nephew...

35
00:03:52,335 --> 00:03:57,170
...who just might be my ticket out
of this flophouse, he might.

36
00:04:00,175 --> 00:04:02,769
Yeah, you'd better run!

37
00:04:08,575 --> 00:04:12,011
"Dear Rich Doctor Nephew,
I can help you be funny.

38
00:04:12,255 --> 00:04:14,564
The first funny thing
you must do...

39
00:04:14,735 --> 00:04:18,853
...is put your money in check form
and come to Hollywood."

40
00:04:19,055 --> 00:04:22,934
"Sincerely, Harold Zoid.
P. S: cashier's check."

41
00:04:23,135 --> 00:04:26,252
Did you hear that?
I'm going to Hollywood!

42
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:44,207
Welcome to Hollywood!

43
00:04:44,455 --> 00:04:45,570
I must warn you...

44
00:04:45,975 --> 00:04:50,571
...there's no refund if you get
discovered and leave the tour.

45
00:04:50,935 --> 00:04:53,165
I'm kidding. That never happens.

46
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:57,766
Now, to your right, you'll see
30th Century Fox Studios.

47
00:04:58,015 --> 00:05:00,529
Fox uses searchlights
to blind pilots...

48
00:05:00,735 --> 00:05:04,569
...then film
the resulting plane crashes.

49
00:05:07,655 --> 00:05:08,974
- Neat!
- Ahead...

50
00:05:09,175 --> 00:05:15,364
<i>...you'll see the home of Mel Gibson,
star of the hit film Bravehead.</i>

51
00:05:15,735 --> 00:05:17,965
Do we have any fans of Calculon...

52
00:05:18,215 --> 00:05:20,854
<i>...star of the robot soap
All My Circuits?</i>

53
00:05:21,455 --> 00:05:23,173
I am! Me! Bender is!

54
00:05:23,375 --> 00:05:27,573
Then you'll want to get a close look
at his Bel Air home.

55
00:05:27,775 --> 00:05:29,288
Yes, I will.

56
00:05:34,215 --> 00:05:36,365
- Are you my hot-water heater?
- No.

57
00:05:36,615 --> 00:05:39,175
- We met once. Remember?
- Absolutely not.

58
00:05:39,375 --> 00:05:41,969
Remember I was bugging you a lot?

59
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:46,646
- You remember, right?
- Look, I'm programmed to be very busy.

60
00:05:46,855 --> 00:05:51,565
Unless you can heat water
to 21 2 degrees, I'm not interested.

61
00:05:53,215 --> 00:05:56,969
Have you got an extra GOTO 1 0 line?
I don't need a Bender.

62
00:05:57,175 --> 00:06:00,087
That was the other guy.
My name's Boiler.

63
00:06:02,175 --> 00:06:05,451
- Nice work, Boiler.
- Thanks. And call me Bender.

64
00:06:09,255 --> 00:06:13,453
That's where I'm meeting Uncle Zoid
to discuss my dreams.

65
00:06:13,655 --> 00:06:17,409
Next time you see me,
don't be surprised if I've eaten.

66
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:26,888
Uncle Zoid! You look young enough
to be thrown back.

67
00:06:27,095 --> 00:06:28,210
Rich nephew!

68
00:06:28,455 --> 00:06:33,768
Come over here and give your uncle
a nice, big meal.

69
00:06:36,255 --> 00:06:37,688
So, here we are.

70
00:06:37,935 --> 00:06:40,005
A still-famous film comedian...

71
00:06:40,215 --> 00:06:44,094
And a rich, respected doctor
with surviving patients.

72
00:06:44,295 --> 00:06:47,412
Eating in a restaurant,
as we both often do.

73
00:06:47,615 --> 00:06:51,767
- So, you want to be a comedian, is it?
- It's my lifelong dream.

74
00:06:51,975 --> 00:06:55,604
That dream dies now!
You're unfunny and untalented!

75
00:06:55,855 --> 00:06:58,653
That's why you're perfect for drama!

76
00:06:58,815 --> 00:07:00,214
Serious drama?

77
00:07:00,415 --> 00:07:04,169
Perhaps it is time to give up comedy.

78
00:07:05,895 --> 00:07:09,808
I'm putting together
a big drama picture as we speak.

79
00:07:10,055 --> 00:07:14,173
The script is dynamite!
I know because I wrote it myself.

80
00:07:14,415 --> 00:07:16,167
By directing and starring...

81
00:07:16,375 --> 00:07:20,891
...I'll be back on top
after 50 miserable years...

82
00:07:21,415 --> 00:07:23,565
...of fame.
- Ah, fame.

83
00:07:23,775 --> 00:07:27,973
- Where do I come in?
- This film has a juicy part for you...

84
00:07:28,175 --> 00:07:31,406
...if you completely finance it
with your money.

85
00:07:31,655 --> 00:07:33,771
So, are you in?

86
00:07:34,255 --> 00:07:37,292
Okay. How much do I have to invest?

87
00:07:37,495 --> 00:07:41,170
Not much. Not much.
A million dollars.

88
00:07:41,455 --> 00:07:44,606
Then it's settled.
Another big Hollywood deal!

89
00:07:44,815 --> 00:07:47,375
- What can I get you?
- Is bread free?

90
00:07:47,615 --> 00:07:49,446
- Yeah.
- We'll split an order.

91
00:07:59,655 --> 00:08:03,694
- What's with Monstro?
- He promised his uncle a million bucks.

92
00:08:03,935 --> 00:08:07,814
I've been here a day,
and already I'm a Hollywood phony.

93
00:08:08,015 --> 00:08:11,166
Perhaps I could call on
TV's Calculon to help...

94
00:08:11,375 --> 00:08:13,093
...now that I'm in show biz.

95
00:08:13,295 --> 00:08:19,370
- Since when have you been in the biz?
- Long enough, little man. Long enough.

96
00:08:36,175 --> 00:08:39,884
I would be remiss
if I didn't bring you scripts...

97
00:08:40,055 --> 00:08:43,172
...that can make you
an international film star.

98
00:08:43,415 --> 00:08:45,212
Tell me about the project.

99
00:08:45,455 --> 00:08:48,686
- It's a movie.
- Interesting. Tell me more.

100
00:08:48,935 --> 00:08:52,894
Get this. For a scant
$ 1 million investment...

101
00:08:53,135 --> 00:08:54,568
...you can be the star.

102
00:08:54,775 --> 00:08:55,969
And?

103
00:08:56,175 --> 00:09:00,168
- And it'll win you an Oscar.
- An Oscar, you say?

104
00:09:00,335 --> 00:09:04,965
That would get me out
of television once and for all.

105
00:09:05,215 --> 00:09:06,853
Let me see the script.

106
00:09:07,855 --> 00:09:09,971
No. No, I don't like the font.

107
00:09:10,175 --> 00:09:12,484
Wait! Harold Zoid?

108
00:09:12,695 --> 00:09:16,574
- Was this written by the Harold Zoid?
- Written and xeroxed.

109
00:09:16,735 --> 00:09:20,774
Good heavens. A chance to work
with the legendary Harold Zoid!

110
00:09:20,935 --> 00:09:22,607
He's one of my idols!

111
00:09:22,855 --> 00:09:26,814
- You can guarantee me the Oscar?
- I can guarantee anything.

112
00:09:27,055 --> 00:09:28,966
- Then I'll do it!
- Hooray!

113
00:09:29,175 --> 00:09:30,767
Here's your checkbook!

114
00:09:35,935 --> 00:09:38,574
Ladies and gentlemen,
our director...

115
00:09:38,735 --> 00:09:42,569
...the legendary Harold Zoid!

116
00:09:43,415 --> 00:09:46,725
Thank you.
A more classic movie plot there isn't.

117
00:09:46,935 --> 00:09:50,484
A son doesn't want to follow
in his father's business.

118
00:09:50,735 --> 00:09:53,966
And that business is being
president of Earth.

119
00:09:54,215 --> 00:09:56,968
The son is vice president.

120
00:09:57,175 --> 00:09:59,405
That makes sense. Wink, wink.

121
00:09:59,615 --> 00:10:03,449
- You said, "Wink, wink."
- No, I didn't. Raise middle finger.

122
00:10:06,175 --> 00:10:10,248
Now, remember, I can't stress
this enough, this is a talkie.

123
00:10:10,455 --> 00:10:15,813
So I want the full gamut of emotions
from every actor in every scene.

124
00:10:16,015 --> 00:10:18,893
<i>The Magnificent Three.
Scene one, take one.</i>

125
00:10:19,095 --> 00:10:20,608
And action!

126
00:10:20,855 --> 00:10:23,449
Take back your gilded pen, Father.

127
00:10:23,655 --> 00:10:27,443
Signing bills into law was
always your dream, not mine.

128
00:10:27,655 --> 00:10:29,771
Cut! Cut it!

129
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:33,405
I said this is a talkie!
You've got to emote more!

130
00:10:33,655 --> 00:10:37,887
And you extras? Wave your arms!
What is this, a morgue?

131
00:10:38,095 --> 00:10:41,610
<i>The Magnificent Three.
Scene 1 0, take 95.</i>

132
00:10:41,855 --> 00:10:44,653
Action!
And I mean circus-grade action.

133
00:10:44,855 --> 00:10:49,292
Sir? I call upon you,
not as a president...

134
00:10:49,535 --> 00:10:52,971
...but as a father!

135
00:10:54,575 --> 00:10:58,488
Cut! Cut it!
Would you show a little emotion?

136
00:10:58,735 --> 00:11:02,125
People, please.
Just because it's a dramatic scene...

137
00:11:02,335 --> 00:11:05,213
...doesn't mean you can't
do a little comedy.

138
00:11:05,415 --> 00:11:07,451
Throw a pie, for God's sake!

139
00:11:15,015 --> 00:11:17,006
No!

140
00:11:22,935 --> 00:11:28,089
Cut! Cut it! Look, it's all right, kid.
We'll get it in editing.

141
00:11:28,335 --> 00:11:29,654
That's a wrap!

142
00:11:29,855 --> 00:11:32,767
I'm gonna see you at the premiere!
Which is...?

143
00:11:33,015 --> 00:11:35,973
Editing is a long
and expensive process.

144
00:11:36,215 --> 00:11:40,094
We spent all the money on pies,
so it'll be ready Friday.

145
00:11:47,295 --> 00:11:51,004
Nice turnout. That Oscar's
practically on your mantel.

146
00:11:51,255 --> 00:11:54,247
I just pray they like me
half as much as I do.

147
00:12:03,815 --> 00:12:06,375
I agreed to be your vice president!

148
00:12:06,575 --> 00:12:10,011
But I never agreed to be your son!

149
00:12:13,215 --> 00:12:19,370
- Thank you, Lieutenant Smith.
- Good morning, Mr. Vice President.

150
00:12:22,015 --> 00:12:26,566
We're missing it! My life's goal
is to attend a Hollywood shindig.

151
00:12:26,815 --> 00:12:29,090
- Pay the valet the 2 bucks.
- No!

152
00:12:29,295 --> 00:12:33,447
It's the principle of the thing.
I see a parking lot ahead.

153
00:12:42,495 --> 00:12:45,965
I have asked you to join me
on the White House roof...

154
00:12:46,215 --> 00:12:48,854
...so we could have
a heart-to-heart talk.

155
00:12:49,055 --> 00:12:51,569
I'll never follow in your footsteps!

156
00:12:51,815 --> 00:12:55,171
Here is my resignation
as vice president!

157
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:59,004
No! My son will not shame me
like this!

158
00:12:59,255 --> 00:13:01,769
I would sooner die, I would!

159
00:13:02,015 --> 00:13:04,575
Father! The ledge!

160
00:13:07,175 --> 00:13:09,086
The president is dead.

161
00:13:09,335 --> 00:13:11,974
Congratulations, Mr. President!

162
00:13:12,175 --> 00:13:14,370
No!

163
00:13:21,055 --> 00:13:25,526
- He's a visionary!
- Everyone walked out. They hated it.

164
00:13:25,695 --> 00:13:28,334
Plagues have had better
opening nights.

165
00:13:28,615 --> 00:13:31,175
You said the Oscar
was practically mine!

166
00:13:31,335 --> 00:13:34,293
That's why I used the qualifier
"practically."

167
00:13:34,495 --> 00:13:37,567
You listen to me.
I'm out a million bucks!

168
00:13:37,735 --> 00:13:39,805
Get me that Oscar,
or you're dead!

169
00:13:40,015 --> 00:13:45,373
You and these sniveling lobsters!
Dead, you hear me? Dead!

170
00:13:46,215 --> 00:13:48,445
Oy! Now he emotes.

171
00:13:55,935 --> 00:14:00,167
Four hundred categories
and not a single nomination for me.

172
00:14:00,375 --> 00:14:04,653
- But you won this Golden Globe!
- That's the Emmy of movie awards!

173
00:14:05,735 --> 00:14:09,364
- I want an Oscar!
- Then maybe you should act better.

174
00:14:09,575 --> 00:14:11,247
It's not about acting...

175
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:15,494
...it's about earning the respect
of the creative community!

176
00:14:15,695 --> 00:14:18,255
- We could rig the awards.
- That's fine!

177
00:14:22,855 --> 00:14:27,007
It's no use. The tar is too thick.
Plus, I think I flooded it.

178
00:14:27,215 --> 00:14:31,493
Well, we're gonna die.
We might as well enjoy the sights.

179
00:14:31,735 --> 00:14:34,886
Oh, my God! Sylvester Stallone!

180
00:14:37,095 --> 00:14:40,804
This is where you live?
I thought you were a movie star.

181
00:14:41,015 --> 00:14:44,166
No, I'm not.
I'm an even bigger liar than you!

182
00:14:44,375 --> 00:14:48,334
My career went down
the day they invented Smell-A-Vision.

183
00:14:48,535 --> 00:14:52,574
Calculon's gonna kill us.
It's all everybody else's fault!

184
00:14:52,775 --> 00:14:58,088
All I wanted was for people to think
of me one last time before I die.

185
00:14:58,295 --> 00:15:02,766
What are you talking about?
Everybody remembers Harold Zoid.

186
00:15:02,975 --> 00:15:08,174
As a pathetic has-been
and forgotten relic, they remember me!

187
00:15:08,415 --> 00:15:10,246
It's better to die now.

188
00:15:10,455 --> 00:15:14,084
No! This is one death
I won't be responsible for.

189
00:15:14,335 --> 00:15:16,007
Zoidberg away!

190
00:15:25,975 --> 00:15:27,772
Hi. I'm Joan Rivers' head.

191
00:15:27,975 --> 00:15:32,890
I've had so many face-lifts, they
finally lifted it right off my body!

192
00:15:33,135 --> 00:15:35,365
It's true! It's true!

193
00:15:35,575 --> 00:15:40,774
Here comes Jack Nicholson's DNA,
reconstituted in a gorilla body!

194
00:15:43,455 --> 00:15:44,604
Catering.

195
00:15:50,135 --> 00:15:53,684
Here's washed-up actor
what's-his-name, Harold Zoid.

196
00:15:53,895 --> 00:15:57,524
Are you presenting one of the awards
or getting one?

197
00:15:57,735 --> 00:15:59,293
I'm a seat filler.

198
00:15:59,535 --> 00:16:02,891
My only marketable skill
is to occupy space.

199
00:16:07,215 --> 00:16:10,844
The second I don't win that award,
you're cat food.

200
00:16:11,055 --> 00:16:13,569
Right, Boxy?

201
00:16:18,455 --> 00:16:22,767
<i>And now, the host of the 1 07 4th
Academy Awards...</i>

202
00:16:22,975 --> 00:16:26,047
<i>... Billy Crystal!</i>

203
00:16:26,255 --> 00:16:29,770
Now I know how a Pez dispenser feels.

204
00:16:30,775 --> 00:16:33,369
Oh, you like that one, Jack?

205
00:16:37,015 --> 00:16:39,893
All right.
We're already one hour behind.

206
00:16:40,135 --> 00:16:44,174
Our first award tonight,
Best Cinematography.

207
00:16:46,295 --> 00:16:50,004
You want to play tic-tac-toe
before we eat our shoes?

208
00:16:50,255 --> 00:16:53,292
Oh, I knew I'd die
at the bottom of a pit.

209
00:16:53,535 --> 00:16:56,368
But a pit full of tar?

210
00:16:56,575 --> 00:17:00,488
What was that? A tar dolphin?
Or a tar shark?

211
00:17:00,695 --> 00:17:04,404
It's some kind of hollow tube
devoid of human life.

212
00:17:04,655 --> 00:17:08,364
The L.A. subway!
We can blast our way in and escape!

213
00:17:08,535 --> 00:17:11,572
All right, but I still feel like
having a shoe.

214
00:17:15,695 --> 00:17:19,324
- What category is it?
- They're giving out minor awards.

215
00:17:19,495 --> 00:17:23,124
- They're up to writing.
- That leaves Best Product Placement...

216
00:17:23,295 --> 00:17:25,490
...and Best Actor.
There's no time.

217
00:17:25,695 --> 00:17:28,687
And the nominees for
Best Product Placement are:

218
00:17:28,935 --> 00:17:31,403
<i>Star Trek: The Pepsi Generation.</i>

219
00:17:31,655 --> 00:17:33,611
<i>They Call Me Mr. Pibb.</i>

220
00:17:33,855 --> 00:17:36,210
<i>And Snow White and the 7 Ups.</i>

221
00:17:38,575 --> 00:17:42,011
And now to present the award
for Best Actor...

222
00:17:42,255 --> 00:17:45,884
<i>... a bit player in the flop movie
The Magnificent Three...</i>

223
00:17:46,135 --> 00:17:48,968
<i>... Dr. Zoidberg.</i>

224
00:17:52,415 --> 00:17:56,090
Okay, Boxy.
Keep your prong on the trigger.

225
00:17:56,295 --> 00:17:58,763
And the nominees
for Best Actor are:

226
00:17:58,975 --> 00:18:02,684
<i>Sir Lawrence Ooooo
in The Merchant of Venus.</i>

227
00:18:02,935 --> 00:18:06,814
<i>Hive Mind Gamma Seven X
in Bikini Party Summer.</i>

228
00:18:07,055 --> 00:18:10,365
<i>The Soda Machine Robot
in Bikini Party Summer.</i>

229
00:18:10,575 --> 00:18:13,965
<i>Mark Jones
in How Beige Was My Jacket.</i>

230
00:18:14,175 --> 00:18:17,292
And, instead of the fifth guy,
Calculon...

231
00:18:17,535 --> 00:18:22,165
<i>...for his powerhouse performance
in The Magnificent Three.</i>

232
00:18:23,255 --> 00:18:27,134
- He read the wrong name.
- Play along, like with Marisa Tomei.

233
00:18:27,295 --> 00:18:31,004
Hooray! I won't be murdered!
I'll live another day!

234
00:18:31,255 --> 00:18:33,371
Another day of...

235
00:18:33,535 --> 00:18:36,447
...pathetic, forgotten misery.

236
00:18:41,255 --> 00:18:43,405
And the winner is...

237
00:18:47,735 --> 00:18:51,171
And the winner,
instead of any of the nominees...

238
00:18:51,375 --> 00:18:54,685
...is the legendary Harold Zoid!

239
00:18:57,255 --> 00:18:58,893
What?

240
00:19:05,095 --> 00:19:07,165
Thank you! Thank you so much!

241
00:19:07,375 --> 00:19:09,172
Through my ups and downs...

242
00:19:09,415 --> 00:19:13,806
...I thought the most important
thing in life was to win an Oscar.

243
00:19:14,055 --> 00:19:19,971
But tonight I realize what's
really important is to win two Oscars!

244
00:19:20,775 --> 00:19:22,208
I'm kidding.

245
00:19:22,455 --> 00:19:26,209
What matters in life
is that people care about you...

246
00:19:26,455 --> 00:19:29,174
...whether it's a whole crowd...

247
00:19:29,375 --> 00:19:32,970
...or just one die-hard fan.

248
00:19:43,695 --> 00:19:45,606
Thank you, nephew.

249
00:19:45,855 --> 00:19:47,368
Now I can die happy...

250
00:19:47,615 --> 00:19:50,049
...1 0 seconds from now,
when Calculon kills us.

251
00:19:53,695 --> 00:19:55,731
- Harold Zoid!
- Hit the deck!

252
00:19:55,935 --> 00:19:58,608
- Where's that Oscar?
- Here. Enjoy.

253
00:19:58,855 --> 00:20:03,053
Why are you upset? It's less
fraudulent for you to have it.

254
00:20:03,375 --> 00:20:06,811
Yes. Yes, it's a real beauty.

255
00:20:07,055 --> 00:20:10,491
Someday I hope to win one of my own.

256
00:20:10,735 --> 00:20:13,124
Then you're not gonna kill us?

257
00:20:13,335 --> 00:20:18,090
I respect and admire Harold Zoid
too much to beat him to death.

258
00:20:18,335 --> 00:20:20,371
Yeah!

259
00:20:20,935 --> 00:20:21,970
Earthquake!

260
00:20:22,215 --> 00:20:23,409
Hit the deck!

261
00:20:23,655 --> 00:20:25,771
Let the earth quake!

262
00:20:25,975 --> 00:20:29,206
I've got somebody's Oscar!

263
00:20:36,655 --> 00:20:41,251
- We made it! I'm at a Hollywood party!
- I'm sorry. This is a private...

264
00:20:41,455 --> 00:20:45,164
Oh, pardon me.
I see you're with Mr. Stallone.
