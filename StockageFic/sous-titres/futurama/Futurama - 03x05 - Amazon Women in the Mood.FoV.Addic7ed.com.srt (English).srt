00:00:07,253 --> 00:00:09,369
Amazon Women in the Mood

2
00:00:33,933 --> 00:00:37,721
People, we got a problem.
Nibbler's been coughing up hairballs.

3
00:00:37,933 --> 00:00:40,766
So has Fry. What's the big deal?

4
00:00:42,533 --> 00:00:43,761
He's got me beat.

5
00:00:43,973 --> 00:00:48,330
We all love Nibbler, so it's only fair
that we all clean up together.

6
00:00:48,533 --> 00:00:52,242
Still, I propose we make Zoidberg
do it. All in favor?

7
00:00:52,773 --> 00:00:54,684
All opposed?

8
00:00:55,333 --> 00:00:57,164
All abstaining?

9
00:00:57,533 --> 00:01:00,411
Dr. Zoidberg, are you okay?

10
00:01:01,093 --> 00:01:02,765
He's dead.

11
00:01:03,173 --> 00:01:05,243
He always seemed so full of life.

12
00:01:05,453 --> 00:01:10,527
Laughing, singing, begging for scraps.
And now this!

13
00:01:12,973 --> 00:01:15,009
Why with all the crying?

14
00:01:15,173 --> 00:01:18,131
So, that's where I left my shell.

15
00:01:19,173 --> 00:01:20,925
I didn't know it came off.

16
00:01:21,093 --> 00:01:24,688
It was getting a little cramped,
so I molted, why not?

17
00:01:25,573 --> 00:01:29,202
- The fresh air feels good.
- Stop doing that!

18
00:01:29,893 --> 00:01:33,329
So long. I'm off to toss
this old shell in the dumpster...

19
00:01:33,493 --> 00:01:36,929
...and maybe pick up the potato chips
Amy didn't finish.

20
00:01:37,133 --> 00:01:40,967
- Those were toenail clippings.
- A feast is a feast.

21
00:01:44,013 --> 00:01:46,607
Hey, that's my cell phone!

22
00:01:48,933 --> 00:01:50,969
Hello?

23
00:01:52,533 --> 00:01:56,082
Hello? Who is this?

24
00:01:56,253 --> 00:01:58,448
Hello?

25
00:01:59,773 --> 00:02:01,968
Did you swallow your phone again?

26
00:02:02,133 --> 00:02:05,967
Some guy's been calling and hanging
up 1 0 times a day for a year.

27
00:02:06,173 --> 00:02:08,607
Men who call too much
are the worst, I bet.

28
00:02:08,813 --> 00:02:10,963
I wish a decent guy would call me.

29
00:02:11,133 --> 00:02:16,161
Not this spleeze-ball who has me
too terrified to answer the phone.

30
00:02:16,333 --> 00:02:18,005
Hello?

31
00:02:21,493 --> 00:02:23,961
<i>Hello? Is anyone there?</i>

32
00:02:24,133 --> 00:02:25,964
I love you!

33
00:02:35,093 --> 00:02:40,087
Why must I be such a coward?

34
00:02:40,253 --> 00:02:43,370
I'm off to the men's room,
and I need an attendant...

35
00:02:43,533 --> 00:02:46,650
Oh, I'm sorry.
You're crying like a woman.

36
00:02:46,813 --> 00:02:51,762
I see myself as a father figure
to some of my more pathetic men.

37
00:02:51,933 --> 00:02:54,891
Kif, old friend, let's rap.

38
00:02:55,093 --> 00:02:58,768
Well, I'm in love with this girl.

39
00:03:00,693 --> 00:03:04,163
Oh, that's rich! Go on.

40
00:03:04,373 --> 00:03:05,726
I met her a year ago...

41
00:03:05,893 --> 00:03:10,364
...escaping from that cruise ship
you piloted into a black hole.

42
00:03:11,693 --> 00:03:14,048
<i>Yes, it was in all the papers.</i>

43
00:03:17,933 --> 00:03:19,491
Call me.

44
00:03:25,773 --> 00:03:28,651
- I've finished talking.
- Belay that remark!

45
00:03:29,013 --> 00:03:33,291
Your Amy knows my Leela?
I have formed an idea.

46
00:03:35,533 --> 00:03:39,003
I want to negotiate a double date.
You and me, Kif and Amy.

47
00:03:39,173 --> 00:03:40,162
<i>Forget it!</i>

48
00:03:40,373 --> 00:03:44,412
<i>Then let the negotiations begin.
I propose we go out on 1 0 dates.</i>

49
00:03:44,613 --> 00:03:46,126
- How about zero?
- Nine.

50
00:03:46,333 --> 00:03:48,289
- Zero.
- Seven? Eight?

51
00:03:48,493 --> 00:03:52,088
Please? Kif's the sweetest guy
who ever liked me.

52
00:03:52,293 --> 00:03:55,251
Five, and that's my final offer.
Four!

53
00:03:55,973 --> 00:03:57,008
- One.
- Two.

54
00:03:57,213 --> 00:03:58,532
- Half.
- I'll take it.

55
00:03:58,733 --> 00:04:02,442
<i>We'll meet you for part of dinner
and half of a movie.</i>

56
00:04:14,813 --> 00:04:20,968
Sir? I don't go out on many dates.
What if I don't know what to say?

57
00:04:21,173 --> 00:04:23,084
Here's my book of pickup lines.

58
00:04:23,253 --> 00:04:27,166
Say as many as you can,
as fast as you can. Don't stop.

59
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:31,485
- I'll just give her these flowers.
- Wrong, wrong, wrong.

60
00:04:31,653 --> 00:04:36,249
And what's that? Candy?
Candy's for dorks. Give me that.

61
00:04:49,173 --> 00:04:52,927
- Hello, beautiful. I got these for you.
- Thanks.

62
00:04:56,173 --> 00:05:01,167
Well, well. This looks to be
one disturbingly erotic date.

63
00:05:01,373 --> 00:05:02,522
Half-date.

64
00:05:02,733 --> 00:05:04,610
- A bottle of wine.
- Half-bottle.

65
00:05:04,773 --> 00:05:07,810
- And oysters on the half-shell.
- Quarter-shell.

66
00:05:07,973 --> 00:05:11,090
- And I'd like...
- He's not hungry. It's expensive.

67
00:05:11,293 --> 00:05:15,252
I'd like two steaks, and the ladies
will have sensual salads...

68
00:05:15,413 --> 00:05:17,688
...with low-cal sensual dressing.

69
00:05:31,493 --> 00:05:33,165
Thank you.

70
00:05:34,853 --> 00:05:37,731
Kif, you haven't said a word
all night.

71
00:05:37,933 --> 00:05:39,810
Well...

72
00:05:40,573 --> 00:05:42,529
Hello.

73
00:05:42,693 --> 00:05:46,732
Because I was really hoping
we could talk and stuff.

74
00:05:52,013 --> 00:05:54,686
"If I said you had a beautiful body...

75
00:05:54,853 --> 00:05:57,413
...would you take your pants off
and dance?"

76
00:05:57,573 --> 00:06:00,610
- What?
- Lieutenant Kroker!

77
00:06:02,213 --> 00:06:05,888
"I find the most erotic part
of a woman is the boobies."

78
00:06:07,613 --> 00:06:11,811
This half-date is entirely over.
Amy? Conference.

79
00:06:12,013 --> 00:06:14,686
Is there nothing we can do?

80
00:06:14,853 --> 00:06:18,448
There's one way into a woman's heart
and parts beyond.

81
00:06:18,613 --> 00:06:20,808
I speak, of course, of karaoke.

82
00:06:20,973 --> 00:06:24,932
My years in the Duke Boys' Chorus
will not have been in vain.

83
00:06:27,333 --> 00:06:30,405
All right, enough lipstick.
Let's storm out.

84
00:06:37,053 --> 00:06:39,567
Oh, that's so emotional!

85
00:06:43,333 --> 00:06:44,652
Amateur hour's over.

86
00:06:44,813 --> 00:06:48,249
Let me show you why they call me
"The Velour Fog."

87
00:06:48,413 --> 00:06:49,892
Hit it.

88
00:07:05,013 --> 00:07:07,846
- Give us a break.
- He sickens me!

89
00:07:42,093 --> 00:07:44,402
We're going home.
Call us a space taxi.

90
00:07:44,573 --> 00:07:47,963
No need. There's not a
restaurant built I can't fly.

91
00:07:48,133 --> 00:07:49,248
Where to, ladies?

92
00:07:49,413 --> 00:07:52,962
Please, sir.
Let's just divide up the check, and...

93
00:07:53,453 --> 00:07:55,967
Let's see what this eatery can do.

94
00:08:00,973 --> 00:08:05,012
She's built like a steak house,
but she handles like a bistro.

95
00:08:05,773 --> 00:08:07,650
She's out of control!

96
00:08:07,813 --> 00:08:10,281
You win again, gravity!

97
00:08:17,733 --> 00:08:22,204
Look! My new shell catalog!
So, let's try some on, already!

98
00:08:25,773 --> 00:08:27,411
<i>Ah, muy macho.</i>

99
00:08:27,573 --> 00:08:32,169
Hey, gringos, here comes El Zoido
to ruin your drinking water!

100
00:08:32,533 --> 00:08:33,648
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

101
00:08:33,853 --> 00:08:36,447
I'm Mexican, and I find that offensive!

102
00:08:39,333 --> 00:08:41,563
You Latins are so hot-blooded.

103
00:08:43,013 --> 00:08:44,765
This one's like a summer guy!

104
00:08:44,933 --> 00:08:49,927
The Planet Express health plan only
covers one kind of replacement shell.

105
00:08:55,533 --> 00:08:58,206
I can't believe Leela and Amy
aren't back.

106
00:08:58,373 --> 00:09:00,682
I'm gonna call the restaurant.

107
00:09:02,013 --> 00:09:05,847
<i>The number you have dialed
has crashed into a planet.</i>

108
00:09:07,053 --> 00:09:09,408
- We gotta go rescue them!
- I don't know.

109
00:09:09,613 --> 00:09:12,286
<i>Bender, think of the señoritas!</i>

110
00:09:12,613 --> 00:09:13,682
<i>Vámonos!</i>

111
00:09:23,773 --> 00:09:25,729
So, Amy...

112
00:09:27,173 --> 00:09:30,722
- It's always a line with you.
- What planet is this?

113
00:09:30,893 --> 00:09:36,331
- This whole sector is uncharted.
- It is not. You lost the chart.

114
00:09:36,533 --> 00:09:41,653
Well, nothing to do but repopulate
the human race, just me and you.

115
00:09:41,813 --> 00:09:43,485
And maybe you.

116
00:09:45,493 --> 00:09:47,211
What is it?

117
00:10:00,813 --> 00:10:06,365
- Me hear people, but me not see.
- Everybody make mistake.

118
00:10:09,013 --> 00:10:11,481
Well, hello.
I usually don't say this...

119
00:10:11,653 --> 00:10:16,602
...but you are the most beautiful trio
of gigantic ladies I've ever seen.

120
00:10:19,533 --> 00:10:23,412
I find the most erotic part
of a woman is the boo...

121
00:10:39,973 --> 00:10:42,282
Oh, no.
Any sign of Leela or Amy?

122
00:10:42,493 --> 00:10:44,848
No, but what do you make of this?

123
00:10:45,013 --> 00:10:48,767
I don't know, but it might have
something to do with this.

124
00:10:50,773 --> 00:10:53,765
Oh, your God!

125
00:10:55,693 --> 00:10:58,048
Move. Go.

126
00:10:58,373 --> 00:11:00,603
All right. Here's the plan.

127
00:11:02,653 --> 00:11:04,928
What kind of moronic plan is that?

128
00:11:05,773 --> 00:11:07,411
Wow.

129
00:11:12,653 --> 00:11:15,611
Women go free. Men stay in chains.

130
00:11:15,813 --> 00:11:19,442
We take them to our leader.
She know what do.

131
00:11:19,653 --> 00:11:21,132
A female leader?

132
00:11:21,333 --> 00:11:23,483
- Fry, shut up!
- Yes, captain.

133
00:11:23,693 --> 00:11:26,412
This capital city, planet Amazonia.

134
00:11:26,613 --> 00:11:30,083
- Where are all the men?
- Men die out many year ago.

135
00:11:30,293 --> 00:11:35,686
They were probably nagged to death.
Are you with me, fellas?

136
00:11:38,813 --> 00:11:42,044
Here stadium, where women
basketball teams play.

137
00:11:42,253 --> 00:11:46,405
- No can dunk, but good fundamentals.
- That more fun to watch.

138
00:11:49,053 --> 00:11:50,771
Oh, God, you're killing me.

139
00:11:50,933 --> 00:11:52,366
God, you're killing me!

140
00:11:53,693 --> 00:11:57,003
This our comedy club.
Humor different here.

141
00:11:57,213 --> 00:11:59,124
It not reinforce stereotypes.

142
00:11:59,293 --> 00:12:03,571
Comedy come from character,
not abstract craziness.

143
00:12:03,773 --> 00:12:06,367
Translation: boring.

144
00:12:08,013 --> 00:12:09,651
That's a good one.

145
00:12:09,853 --> 00:12:14,563
- This planet sounds better and better.
- I'm already looking for apartments.

146
00:12:16,573 --> 00:12:21,044
Here live vengeful, all-knowing
leader. She decide men's fates.

147
00:12:21,213 --> 00:12:24,011
- Is she hot?
- Not important. She all-knowing.

148
00:12:24,213 --> 00:12:26,044
In other words, no.

149
00:12:38,373 --> 00:12:42,048
- All hail Fem-puter.
- All hail Fem-puter!

150
00:12:42,213 --> 00:12:47,492
- You obey a big computer?
- Yes. It appeared at time men die out.

151
00:12:47,693 --> 00:12:51,811
- Why did you make it your leader?
- It different kind of politician.

152
00:12:51,973 --> 00:12:53,691
Not beltway insider.

153
00:12:53,893 --> 00:12:58,284
Fem-puter, we bring offering
of bath beads and scented soaps.

154
00:12:58,493 --> 00:13:04,682
<i>Your gift pleases Fem-puter.
Why are there men on her planet?!</i>

155
00:13:04,853 --> 00:13:07,492
<i>- It was an accident.
- That does not fem-pute.</i>

156
00:13:07,653 --> 00:13:12,602
<i>Fem-puter will return
after deciding your punishment!</i>

157
00:13:17,053 --> 00:13:20,443
I'm through making fun of women.
I want them to help me.

158
00:13:20,653 --> 00:13:22,405
Should we do something?

159
00:13:23,493 --> 00:13:25,006
There's no hurry.

160
00:13:25,173 --> 00:13:28,290
Yes. A little tighter.
Tighter.

161
00:13:28,453 --> 00:13:32,526
Perhaps a hard spanking is in order?
Too hard!

162
00:13:32,693 --> 00:13:36,766
- Men strange. You have them?
- I'm afraid so.

163
00:13:36,973 --> 00:13:38,406
What they for?

164
00:13:41,173 --> 00:13:44,210
You mean snu-snu!

165
00:13:45,573 --> 00:13:48,246
We hear tell men used for snu-snu.

166
00:13:48,453 --> 00:13:52,526
<i>All we have go on are ancient legend
and subscription to Cosmo.</i>

167
00:13:52,693 --> 00:13:55,412
FYI, I could be used for snu-snu.

168
00:13:55,573 --> 00:13:59,361
Silence! You want die
like last men visit Amazonia?

169
00:13:59,573 --> 00:14:02,770
- What did they die of?
- Crushed pelvises.

170
00:14:03,573 --> 00:14:06,133
- Yes!
- Thank you, Lord in heaven!

171
00:14:08,933 --> 00:14:14,565
<i>After lengthy fem-putations,
I have decided the fate of the men.</i>

172
00:14:14,733 --> 00:14:18,442
<i>Fem-puter sentences them to death...</i>

173
00:14:20,253 --> 00:14:22,847
<i>...by snu-snu!
- Yeah!</i>

174
00:14:24,253 --> 00:14:25,845
What are you, gay?

175
00:14:32,013 --> 00:14:36,245
<i>Death to the men!
Death by snu-snu!</i>

176
00:14:38,333 --> 00:14:42,451
- But the snu-snu part will be good.
- Baby, it'll blow your mind.

177
00:14:42,653 --> 00:14:44,245
Be reasonable.

178
00:14:44,453 --> 00:14:48,162
Sure, men are annoying,
and they wreck their planets.

179
00:14:48,333 --> 00:14:53,282
But these men are sort of my friends.
They don't deserve to die.

180
00:14:53,573 --> 00:14:56,610
<i>Perhaps men are not as evil
as Fem-puter thinks.</i>

181
00:14:56,813 --> 00:14:59,043
They make fun women's basketball.

182
00:14:59,253 --> 00:15:02,563
<i>What?! Did you explain how
good fundamentals make up...</i>

183
00:15:02,733 --> 00:15:06,009
<i>...for their inability to dunk?
- Yes. They still laugh.</i>

184
00:15:06,213 --> 00:15:10,092
<i>- The men must die!
- Too true, Fem-puter. You're so wise.</i>

185
00:15:10,253 --> 00:15:12,289
Kill 'em all. Good riddance.

186
00:15:12,493 --> 00:15:15,246
Did I mention I'm not a man?
I'm a manbot.

187
00:15:15,413 --> 00:15:18,291
Understandable mistake.
You can let me down.

188
00:15:18,493 --> 00:15:23,328
- He big jerk like man.
- Sure, but check the crotch. Nothing.

189
00:15:23,533 --> 00:15:25,046
<i>Very well. Release him.</i>

190
00:15:25,213 --> 00:15:29,764
<i>As for the others, take them
to the snu-snu chambers.</i>

191
00:15:42,013 --> 00:15:45,050
- I'll miss you, meat bag.
- Me too, meat bag.

192
00:15:45,213 --> 00:15:49,570
I never thought I'd die like this,
but I'd always really hoped.

193
00:15:49,773 --> 00:15:52,924
<i>The Amazonians will be divided
into three groups.</i>

194
00:15:53,133 --> 00:15:57,490
<i>The one called Zapp will be
snu-snu'd by the large women.</i>

195
00:15:57,693 --> 00:16:02,687
<i>He that is designated Fry will be
snu-snu'd by the petite women.</i>

196
00:16:02,893 --> 00:16:05,453
<i>And Kif,
as the most attractive male...</i>

197
00:16:05,613 --> 00:16:09,731
<i>... will be snu-snu'd by the most
beautiful women of Amazonia.</i>

198
00:16:09,893 --> 00:16:13,932
<i>Then the large women.
Then the petite women.</i>

199
00:16:14,093 --> 00:16:16,687
<i>Then the large women again.</i>

200
00:16:17,173 --> 00:16:18,970
<i>Initiate snu-snu!</i>

201
00:16:21,853 --> 00:16:27,291
Before I die, I have to tell you I
didn't mean to say those awful things.

202
00:16:27,453 --> 00:16:31,002
- They were all Zapp's idea.
- Really? Honest and true?

203
00:16:31,213 --> 00:16:35,604
Yes. And that person calling
and hanging up was me.

204
00:16:35,773 --> 00:16:39,812
I was just too nervous to say hello
because I love you!

205
00:16:40,013 --> 00:16:41,366
Oh, Kif!

206
00:16:41,533 --> 00:16:45,208
It Og's first time. Be gentle!

207
00:16:49,253 --> 00:16:50,925
We've got to do something.

208
00:16:51,093 --> 00:16:54,529
You can interface with the fem-puter
and reprogram it.

209
00:16:54,733 --> 00:16:58,169
Maybe you can interface with my ass.
By biting it!

210
00:17:00,093 --> 00:17:02,288
All right, I'll go.

211
00:17:19,653 --> 00:17:23,043
- How Tonk look?
- Tonk look good. Me fat.

212
00:17:23,213 --> 00:17:27,126
No, you look good. Tonk fat.

213
00:17:33,213 --> 00:17:36,683
<i>Intruder! Stay away from
the mighty Fem-puter! Guards!</i>

214
00:17:36,893 --> 00:17:41,205
Time to override the CPU
and reprogram this fem-puter.

215
00:17:43,053 --> 00:17:45,726
<i>Stop it. Stop it!
Cut that out.</i>

216
00:17:46,933 --> 00:17:48,844
<i>Cease hitting Fem-puter.</i>

217
00:17:49,373 --> 00:17:52,331
You're no fem-puter,
you're a fembot.

218
00:17:52,493 --> 00:17:57,726
It's true. I disguised myself
so I could rule the Amazonians.

219
00:17:57,933 --> 00:18:01,687
- But why?
- Why? Why?

220
00:18:01,853 --> 00:18:05,129
I came here from a faraway planet.

221
00:18:05,293 --> 00:18:10,048
A planet ruled by a chauvinistic
man-puter that was really a manbot.

222
00:18:10,213 --> 00:18:13,762
Have you any idea how it feels
to be a fembot...

223
00:18:13,933 --> 00:18:18,449
...in a manbot's man-puter's world?
- What?

224
00:18:18,653 --> 00:18:24,011
And now, meddling manbot, there's
the question of what to do with you.

225
00:18:34,573 --> 00:18:38,725
We need rest. The spirit is willing,
but the flesh is spongy and bruised.

226
00:18:38,933 --> 00:18:42,243
- It time snu-snu!
- Can't we just cuddle?

227
00:18:42,453 --> 00:18:44,683
- No!
- Oh.

228
00:18:44,973 --> 00:18:48,329
We can't wait for Bender.
It's time for a woman's touch.

229
00:18:57,653 --> 00:19:01,328
Me next snu-snu! Out me way!

230
00:19:02,893 --> 00:19:07,205
Where go beautiful man?
Me want snu-snu!

231
00:19:12,893 --> 00:19:16,329
- Kif, jump!
- My hero.

232
00:19:19,213 --> 00:19:22,842
Me not get snu-snu. Get him!

233
00:19:38,413 --> 00:19:42,122
Mighty Fem-puter!
Small girl steal green kissy-man.

234
00:19:42,293 --> 00:19:45,922
<i>- We kill her now?
- Come back later. Leave me alone.</i>

235
00:19:46,093 --> 00:19:48,687
<i>Yeah, get lost!</i>

236
00:19:53,093 --> 00:19:57,405
I'm a scary fem-puter.
Release the prisoners.

237
00:19:57,613 --> 00:20:03,131
<i>- And bring gold. Lots of gold.
- Why Fem-puter want gold?</i>

238
00:20:03,333 --> 00:20:05,688
<i>You heard the man.</i>

239
00:20:07,693 --> 00:20:09,649
<i>Come on, give me some of that.</i>

240
00:20:11,773 --> 00:20:17,131
That's how I got my new shell.
It looks just like the one I threw out.

241
00:20:17,293 --> 00:20:22,413
I found it in the same dumpster,
but this one had a live raccoon in it.

242
00:20:22,573 --> 00:20:24,450
Pretty good story, eh?

243
00:20:24,653 --> 00:20:28,009
Stick to someone else,
you windy barnacle!

244
00:20:28,213 --> 00:20:30,966
The battle of the sexes
was only resolved...

245
00:20:31,133 --> 00:20:35,331
...when a manbot and a fembot
realized they loved each other.

246
00:20:35,493 --> 00:20:37,802
By the way, if she calls,
I'm not here.

247
00:20:37,973 --> 00:20:42,489
All I know is, this gold says
that was the best mission ever.

248
00:20:43,493 --> 00:20:45,529
- It sure was.
- Oh, yeah.

249
00:20:45,693 --> 00:20:48,253
I had snu-snu.

250
00:20:48,453 --> 00:20:53,368
So, Amy?
What do you want to do now?
