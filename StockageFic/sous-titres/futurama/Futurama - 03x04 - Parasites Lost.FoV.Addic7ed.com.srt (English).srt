1
00:00:07,253 --> 00:00:09,403
Parasites Lost

2
00:00:47,453 --> 00:00:52,004
<i>Breaker, breaker, this is the Duck.
You wanna back off them hogs?</i>

3
00:00:52,173 --> 00:00:55,927
<i>- Ten-four. About five miles or so.
- Ten, roger.</i>

4
00:00:57,813 --> 00:01:01,328
I'd better check the fluid levels.

5
00:01:03,373 --> 00:01:05,603
We're okay on Coke syrup.

6
00:01:09,773 --> 00:01:12,412
Oh, man, come on!

7
00:01:14,733 --> 00:01:15,927
Coming through!

8
00:01:28,413 --> 00:01:32,008
- What's that black cracker?
- A tomato.

9
00:01:32,213 --> 00:01:35,125
You're eating a sandwich
from a men's room?

10
00:01:35,333 --> 00:01:38,609
What's the worst thing
that could happen?

11
00:01:39,693 --> 00:01:43,606
It's like a party in my mouth,
and everyone's throwing up.

12
00:01:52,813 --> 00:01:55,850
Look. One of them things
like on our mud flaps.

13
00:01:56,013 --> 00:01:59,892
- Yosemite Sam?
- I'm gonna put my moves on her.

14
00:02:04,493 --> 00:02:09,169
Jerk! No one hoots at my captain unless
they wanna go to the next level.

15
00:02:09,373 --> 00:02:13,446
Fry, I'd rather not dignify them
with an ass-whipping.

16
00:02:13,693 --> 00:02:17,368
Yo, sexy mama, let's get busy
and freaky, in that order.

17
00:02:17,533 --> 00:02:22,084
How would you like it if Leela said
she wanted to make love with you?

18
00:02:22,653 --> 00:02:27,329
I got five minutes. She looks
pretty good for a truck-stop chick.

19
00:02:27,653 --> 00:02:32,204
You take that back! She does not
look good for a truck-stop chick!

20
00:02:32,693 --> 00:02:35,844
You're right, she don't got
enough meat for me.

21
00:02:36,053 --> 00:02:39,841
She does too!
She's got more meat than a cow.

22
00:02:40,613 --> 00:02:43,081
Meat than a cow!

23
00:02:45,893 --> 00:02:50,364
I can't please Leela no matter
what I do. I just want her to like me.

24
00:02:50,533 --> 00:02:53,331
Well, there's always hope.

25
00:02:53,773 --> 00:02:56,571
We gotta go fix
the plasma fusion boiler.

26
00:03:02,053 --> 00:03:04,772
- Who are you?
- Scruffy. A janitor.

27
00:03:04,973 --> 00:03:09,603
- Why aren't you fixing the boiler?
- Schedule conflict.

28
00:03:19,213 --> 00:03:20,805
There, fixed forever.

29
00:03:24,333 --> 00:03:28,451
Scruffy's gonna die
the way he lived.

30
00:03:31,693 --> 00:03:34,253
Oh, marmalade.

31
00:03:38,133 --> 00:03:42,251
Oh, the hypochondriac's back.
What is it this time?

32
00:03:42,493 --> 00:03:45,803
- My lead pipe hurts a little.
- That's normal. Next.

33
00:03:53,373 --> 00:03:54,488
He's a witch!

34
00:03:54,693 --> 00:03:58,003
- Did you eat anything unusual recently?
- No.

35
00:03:58,173 --> 00:04:01,848
- What about that bathroom egg salad?
- I've had better.

36
00:04:02,013 --> 00:04:07,087
Egg salad? Zoidberg will have to
examine your gastrointestinal tract.

37
00:04:07,253 --> 00:04:10,450
Come, everyone.
Give Fry some privacy.

38
00:04:13,333 --> 00:04:19,681
If you can't see well enough, there'll
be a close-up on this video screen.

39
00:04:25,133 --> 00:04:28,887
We'll need to have a look
inside you with this camera.

40
00:04:29,053 --> 00:04:31,044
Guess again.

41
00:04:37,573 --> 00:04:39,404
- Gross!
- Go, man, go.

42
00:04:44,293 --> 00:04:49,128
Watch for any subtle irregularity
in Fry's bowel.

43
00:04:50,893 --> 00:04:53,930
It's gorgeous.
That place used to be a dump.

44
00:04:56,453 --> 00:05:01,481
- Worms? Puke-a-tronic!
- So the eggs in that sandwich were...

45
00:05:01,653 --> 00:05:06,443
Correct! Worm eggs. And the
mayonnaise wasn't too fresh either.

46
00:05:06,653 --> 00:05:11,807
It's nauseating, man. Is there no way
to get rid of the disgusting maggots?

47
00:05:11,973 --> 00:05:15,966
Only one. We'll have to travel
deep inside Fry...

48
00:05:16,213 --> 00:05:18,124
...in this!

49
00:05:21,653 --> 00:05:24,326
- Shotgun!
- Shotgun!

50
00:05:28,933 --> 00:05:34,405
In each gastro-survival kit is a rain
slicker, a disposable fun camera...

51
00:05:34,573 --> 00:05:40,523
...and something to protect you
against bacteria: a harpoon.

52
00:05:40,973 --> 00:05:45,888
Yo, old guy. Why do we have to use
micro-droids? Can't you just shrink us?

53
00:05:46,053 --> 00:05:51,525
No. That would require extremely tiny
atoms. Have you priced those lately?

54
00:05:51,693 --> 00:05:55,322
- I'm not made of money. Leave me alone!
- Me next!

55
00:06:09,093 --> 00:06:14,008
Your net suits will let you experience
Fry's worm-infested bowels...

56
00:06:14,173 --> 00:06:16,482
...as if you were actually
wriggling through them.

57
00:06:16,653 --> 00:06:20,123
There's no part of that sentence
I didn't like.

58
00:06:20,293 --> 00:06:23,091
- Is everyone present?
- Definitely.

59
00:06:23,253 --> 00:06:27,883
Here's the plan. We enter the ear,
drip down the back of the throat...

60
00:06:28,053 --> 00:06:32,683
...and make for the bowel. There,
we'll irritate the splenic ganglion...

61
00:06:32,853 --> 00:06:38,007
...and cause a spasm, expelling,
among other things, the parasites.

62
00:06:38,173 --> 00:06:44,043
- I'll tell Fry to wash out his ear.
- No! Fry can't know about the mission.

63
00:06:44,213 --> 00:06:47,569
If he finds out, the worms
will defend themselves.

64
00:06:47,733 --> 00:06:51,965
- They know everything he knows.
- Like how to make ice-cream soup?

65
00:06:52,133 --> 00:06:57,765
- Leela! Your role is to distract Fry.
- Can do!

66
00:06:57,933 --> 00:07:01,892
Leela, you should really try
a facial scrub for your pores.

67
00:07:06,613 --> 00:07:08,729
- Look, a starling!
- Really?

68
00:07:13,813 --> 00:07:16,930
Be very quiet. We're in the ear.

69
00:07:17,093 --> 00:07:18,765
- Okay, professor.
- What?

70
00:07:18,973 --> 00:07:20,531
What about what?

71
00:07:20,693 --> 00:07:25,084
What if we go for a walk, possibly,
because it's such a lovely day?

72
00:07:25,293 --> 00:07:27,170
I'd love to.

73
00:07:29,613 --> 00:07:33,526
- Let's go where he won't put his finger.
- It's hopeless!

74
00:07:33,733 --> 00:07:37,612
Wait! We just have to get past
the eardrum.

75
00:07:44,373 --> 00:07:48,685
- What are they doing to Fry's brain?
- They're giving it a tune-up.

76
00:07:48,853 --> 00:07:52,732
A quick glance suggests
they've doubled his thinking power.

77
00:07:52,893 --> 00:07:55,930
My God! Soon he'll be smarter
than Cher!

78
00:07:56,093 --> 00:08:00,086
Ah, the scent of a rose. Curious
how aromatic hydrocarbons...

79
00:08:00,253 --> 00:08:02,892
...can evoke deep emotions.
For you.

80
00:08:03,173 --> 00:08:05,084
That's a beautiful thought.

81
00:08:05,253 --> 00:08:08,643
And you expressed it
without spewing crumbs at me.

82
00:08:10,893 --> 00:08:15,648
Brace yourselves. We're entering
the interior of Fry's nose.

83
00:08:15,813 --> 00:08:18,281
We're at finger alert five!

84
00:08:18,453 --> 00:08:22,685
Let's just pray nothing stimulates
his smell receptors.

85
00:08:22,933 --> 00:08:25,128
Nobody make a smell.

86
00:08:30,133 --> 00:08:34,888
Quick! We can escape through
that capillary into the sinus.

87
00:08:35,053 --> 00:08:38,329
Usually you don't know
a thing about human anatomy.

88
00:08:38,493 --> 00:08:44,284
I learned it from a decongestant
commercial: "Soothing action..."

89
00:08:57,013 --> 00:08:59,481
- Where are we, the ass?
- The heart.

90
00:08:59,653 --> 00:09:03,202
- Better known as the love muscle.
- Which digests food.

91
00:09:03,453 --> 00:09:07,241
We should be safe so long
as nothing makes it beat faster.

92
00:09:18,373 --> 00:09:20,170
- Abandon ship!
- No!

93
00:09:20,333 --> 00:09:23,609
Set course for
that cholesterol-encrusted valve.

94
00:09:28,693 --> 00:09:34,006
It's good cholesterol,
but it spreads like bad cholesterol.

95
00:09:39,653 --> 00:09:41,962
They're Jazzercising Fry's muscles.

96
00:09:42,133 --> 00:09:46,092
He'll be as strong and flexible as
Gumby and Hercules combined.

97
00:09:46,253 --> 00:09:48,528
Gum-ercules?! I love that guy.

98
00:09:50,373 --> 00:09:55,163
It's that jerk from the truck stop.
Let's go blend in with those pimps.

99
00:09:55,413 --> 00:09:59,406
I don't think so.
Sir, you owe this lady an apology.

100
00:09:59,613 --> 00:10:04,084
Fry, no! He's bulging with
what could be muscles.

101
00:10:04,493 --> 00:10:06,768
I got your apologies right here.

102
00:10:11,373 --> 00:10:17,130
Sorry, ma'am. I've learned a lesson
about not ogling cans I won't forget.

103
00:10:17,453 --> 00:10:22,811
Ah, the stomach.
Scenic gateway to the bowel.

104
00:10:30,333 --> 00:10:32,847
Abandon ship!

105
00:10:33,053 --> 00:10:37,490
No. Don't give up now. We're
close to the pyloric sphincter.

106
00:10:51,853 --> 00:10:53,844
We made it!

107
00:11:02,173 --> 00:11:06,132
There it is,
the stately capitol of Fry's bowel.

108
00:11:06,293 --> 00:11:10,571
A heavily-guarded fortress
surrounding the splenic ganglion.

109
00:11:10,733 --> 00:11:12,371
I've heard of that.

110
00:11:12,533 --> 00:11:18,927
If we can stimulate it, the bowel
will convulse, expelling the worms.

111
00:11:19,093 --> 00:11:21,687
But what about the worms
in other areas?

112
00:11:21,853 --> 00:11:25,050
This is gonna be one hell
of a bowel movement.

113
00:11:25,213 --> 00:11:30,526
- He'll be lucky to have bones left.
- All right, let's mush some worms!

114
00:11:33,533 --> 00:11:36,047
Worms to battle stations!

115
00:11:48,893 --> 00:11:53,728
I had a great time. The flowers,
the puddle, the way you hurt that guy.

116
00:11:53,893 --> 00:11:58,683
But can I axe you something?
Why did you do all that stuff?

117
00:11:58,853 --> 00:12:01,606
There's something I've wanted
to tell you.

118
00:12:01,773 --> 00:12:06,449
But when I try, my mouth feels
like it's stuffed with peanut butter.

119
00:12:06,613 --> 00:12:09,844
- Is it about Bender?
- No, it's about you and me.

120
00:12:10,053 --> 00:12:13,682
- And Bender?
- Bender's not involved. Leela...

121
00:12:14,493 --> 00:12:16,643
...I love you.
- You do?

122
00:12:16,813 --> 00:12:20,965
But only recently have I been able
to articulate my thoughts.

123
00:12:21,133 --> 00:12:23,693
I love you, Leela.
And I always have.

124
00:12:23,853 --> 00:12:27,402
Fry, that's the sweetest,
most wonderful... Wait!

125
00:12:27,573 --> 00:12:30,531
Recently? Like since you ate
that sandwich?

126
00:12:30,773 --> 00:12:36,166
Yeah. I don't know why, but my life
really turned around that day.

127
00:12:36,573 --> 00:12:38,484
Stay here.

128
00:12:39,653 --> 00:12:41,371
Freshen your naugateena?

129
00:12:41,533 --> 00:12:45,572
Please, I need something
to settle my stomach.

130
00:12:51,453 --> 00:12:54,650
The nerve is through here.
Where's Zoidberg?

131
00:12:55,773 --> 00:12:58,287
You'll never guess
where I've been.

132
00:13:07,653 --> 00:13:10,929
One! Two! Three!

133
00:13:11,973 --> 00:13:15,409
There it is.
The pelvic splenic ganglion.

134
00:13:15,733 --> 00:13:19,169
Tickle it, then get ready for the ride
of your lives.

135
00:13:19,333 --> 00:13:24,009
- Don't even think about it.
- Leela! You're in time to help.

136
00:13:24,213 --> 00:13:28,491
If we don't get rid of the worms now,
they'll burrow so deep...

137
00:13:28,653 --> 00:13:32,532
...not even Hermes' famous
jerk prunes could dislodge them.

138
00:13:32,773 --> 00:13:37,005
- I call it Caribbean Drano.
- Fry will be stuck with worms forever.

139
00:13:37,373 --> 00:13:39,091
Perfect.

140
00:13:50,933 --> 00:13:55,051
- I'm okay.
- Leela, you ignorant dope!

141
00:13:55,213 --> 00:13:58,011
- Now the worms will be in Fry forever.
- So?

142
00:13:58,173 --> 00:14:03,293
- Maybe Fry is better off with worms.
- Oh, that's stupid.

143
00:14:03,453 --> 00:14:08,322
If anyone wants to tell me what's
going on, I'll be in the lounge.

144
00:14:10,613 --> 00:14:14,208
Of all the parasites I've had,
these worms are among...

145
00:14:14,413 --> 00:14:18,725
They are the best!
How can I repay you for saving them?

146
00:14:18,893 --> 00:14:21,532
I'll think of something.

147
00:14:22,613 --> 00:14:25,252
Hello, what's all this, then?

148
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:30,643
Apartment 1 -I.
The old me would joke about that.

149
00:14:30,813 --> 00:14:36,649
It's a little under-furnished. I'm
thinking of having a window installed.

150
00:14:36,813 --> 00:14:38,769
The view's perfect already.

151
00:14:38,973 --> 00:14:43,888
That's the corniest thing I've ever
heard. Let me show you the bedroom.

152
00:14:44,053 --> 00:14:45,486
In a minute.

153
00:14:46,453 --> 00:14:47,852
A holophonor?

154
00:14:48,013 --> 00:14:52,370
Only a few people can play that,
and they're not very good.

155
00:14:52,613 --> 00:14:55,127
They don't have you
to inspire them.

156
00:15:46,893 --> 00:15:50,249
I don't have words to say
how wonderful you are.

157
00:15:50,413 --> 00:15:53,803
I haven't felt this happy
since double-soup Tuesday.

158
00:15:54,013 --> 00:15:57,244
With you, every day
is like double-soup Tuesday.

159
00:15:57,453 --> 00:16:01,162
Oh, Fry, I love what you've become.

160
00:16:01,853 --> 00:16:04,321
What I've become...

161
00:16:04,493 --> 00:16:08,202
- What is it?
- There's something I have to find out.

162
00:16:25,373 --> 00:16:28,922
- Who controls this bowel?
- Who wants to know?

163
00:16:32,613 --> 00:16:36,288
- I am the lord mayor of Cologne!
- You mean colon?

164
00:16:36,453 --> 00:16:40,048
- State your business.
- Have you ever been in love?

165
00:16:40,213 --> 00:16:41,805
I thought I was once.

166
00:16:41,973 --> 00:16:45,568
But then I remembered we reproduce
with spore clouds.

167
00:16:45,733 --> 00:16:50,170
A wonderful girl loves me, but I need
to know if it's me she loves...

168
00:16:50,333 --> 00:16:53,848
...or just what you worms
have made of me. So...

169
00:16:54,093 --> 00:16:58,006
...I'm asking you to leave.
- Listen, you! I was born here.

170
00:16:58,253 --> 00:17:03,691
I raised a cloud of children here. My
ancestors came here on the sandwich.

171
00:17:03,853 --> 00:17:06,413
No one can make me leave!

172
00:17:41,093 --> 00:17:44,051
- Get out or the brain gets it!
- He's bluffing!

173
00:17:44,213 --> 00:17:46,852
He wouldn't willingly make
himself an idiot.

174
00:17:47,013 --> 00:17:49,811
Obviously you've never been in love.

175
00:18:01,013 --> 00:18:04,722
Now, the hand-eye coordination lobe.

176
00:18:12,813 --> 00:18:14,769
You've damaged your brain...

177
00:18:14,933 --> 00:18:18,926
...but no more than a few drinks
or five minutes on a cell phone.

178
00:18:19,453 --> 00:18:24,208
I was working my way toward the
control center of the heart and lungs.

179
00:18:24,373 --> 00:18:29,367
- lf I kill myself, you die with me.
- Wait a minute, man.

180
00:18:29,573 --> 00:18:34,442
I hope Satan has a nice colon,
because that's where you're going.

181
00:18:38,773 --> 00:18:44,052
Stop! We'll leave. But one day
you'll be eating a fast-food burger...

182
00:18:44,213 --> 00:18:47,523
...and boom!
You'll be crawling with us again.

183
00:18:47,693 --> 00:18:53,484
<i>Ever wonder what makes
"special sauce" so special? Yo.</i>

184
00:19:09,093 --> 00:19:13,450
Fry? I missed you. Did you find out
what you needed to find out?

185
00:19:13,613 --> 00:19:17,572
- I'm about to. Let me play for you.
- You don't have to.

186
00:19:17,733 --> 00:19:22,568
- I'm still seduced from before.
- Please. It's important to me.

187
00:19:34,253 --> 00:19:36,608
- What does that mean?
- I don't know.

188
00:19:36,773 --> 00:19:40,243
I got nervous and started thinking
about neck bolts.

189
00:19:40,413 --> 00:19:45,043
Wow, did you see that vase break?
It was all like:

190
00:19:45,213 --> 00:19:48,569
- What's happened to you?
- I got rid of the worms.

191
00:19:48,733 --> 00:19:52,726
- Why would you do that?
- I needed to know who you loved...

192
00:19:52,893 --> 00:19:56,772
...me or them.
- Well, which of you wrote that sonnet?

193
00:19:56,933 --> 00:20:02,929
I did! I think. It was probably 50-50.
But that's how I really felt, I swear.

194
00:20:03,093 --> 00:20:06,768
- I don't know.
- Let me try to be romantic on my own.

195
00:20:06,933 --> 00:20:12,291
I've got massage oil. I'll give you a
back rub just like I used to give Amy.

196
00:20:12,453 --> 00:20:15,251
She always seemed to...
Uh-oh.

197
00:20:20,453 --> 00:20:25,288
Sorry you struck out. If it's any
consolation, my life is great.

198
00:20:25,453 --> 00:20:27,728
Babes, bucks, I got it all.

199
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:31,886
Well, at least I learned
Leela's a lost cause. I give up.

200
00:20:32,053 --> 00:20:34,931
There you go! Good night.

201
00:20:35,093 --> 00:20:39,405
I gotta get up early to go
parasailing with movie stars.
