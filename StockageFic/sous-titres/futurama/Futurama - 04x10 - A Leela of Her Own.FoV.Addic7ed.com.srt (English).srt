00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:09,351
Futurama [4x10] - A Leela Of Her Own - CiWaN

2
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:34,318
Put down the binoculars.

3
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:38,712
The wall of that strip club isn't
gonna collapse twice in one day.

4
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:44,040
I know. I accept that. Now I'm
interested in that new pizza parlor.

5
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:47,550
Makes me pine for my days as a delivery
boy. "Here's your pizza," I'd say.

6
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:51,952
"I didn't order any," they'd say.
Then off to my next adventure.

7
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:56,318
That story stunk.
Hand me the binoculars.

8
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:03,950
The owner is from Signas-Five.

9
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:09,115
Signoids? On our block?
They should go back where they came from.

10
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,999
Society's never gonna make progress...

11
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:15,317
Until we learn to pretend
to like each other.

12
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:18,592
Let's make these hideous
strangers feel welcome.

13
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:19,829
No.

14
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:25,313
You sure about these chairs? Guidebook
says human legs bend down at knee.

15
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,112
It's okay, Mama.

16
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:33,156
Anyone complains, I bend
legs up for free. Customers.

17
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:40,508
Welcome to Earth Pizza Store.
Here, sit. I bend the knees for you.

18
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:42,318
That's comfy.

19
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:49,910
What kind of pizza goes in you?

20
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:55,154
Silt? Asbestos?
We got guano, very fresh.

21
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,719
Have any food?

22
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:02,557
Here, try a deep-Dish pizza.
Contains four kinds of things.

23
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:13,749
This tastes like vomit.
Thank you.

24
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,515
Actually, I mean to offend a little.
This is awful.

25
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,352
What's wrong?
Was it something Leela said?

26
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:35,993
We come to Earth to start new life,
raise fat, spoiled Earth kids...

27
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:41,320
Hang many underwear from Earth
clothesline, live Earthican dream.

28
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:46,996
Don't cry, foreign people.
I used to work in a pizzeria.

29
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:49,754
As soon as I stop blasting puke...

30
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:55,910
I'm gonna teach you to sell pizza.
Thank you, magic biped.

31
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:02,120
You save us, sir. If we cannot make
Earth Pizza, our dream will die.

32
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:06,911
Just like rats we
crushed to make the wine.

33
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:18,953
For starters, use quality ingredients.
Case in point? No more live bees.

34
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:23,714
When you put pizzas in the oven,
don't get in with them.

35
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,751
<i>Hey, ocupado.</i>

36
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,959
Most important of all
is the big-Screen TV.

37
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:34,716
Families need a TV so they
don't have to talk to each other.

38
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:37,832
The Earthican pastime. Blernsball.

39
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:44,915
<i>Mulligan drives the ball.
It's going and caught by the shortstop.</i>

40
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:50,752
<i>Mets lose again. I haven 't seen play
this bad since the days of Bob Uecker.</i>

41
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,514
<i>This is Bob Uecker saying
thanks for watching.</i>

42
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:59,995
Mets? Shortstop? Pinching the hitter?
I don't understand this Blernsball.

43
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:05,519
We'll teach you. Your pizzeria will
play a game against Planet Express.

44
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,911
But you'll need nine players.
No problem.

45
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:17,069
Play the ball.

46
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:35,911
Go, team. Beat those no-Good Signoids.

47
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:39,510
Show them they stink in a
game they've never played.

48
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:46,512
Ah, this is why I love Earth.

49
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:51,748
Beautiful star-Brightened day,
friendly Blernsball game with chum pals.

50
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,831
So pleasant for everybody.

51
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:59,039
Hit by a pitch. Take your base.

52
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:04,513
Sorry about that. I guess
I needed a few more warm-Up pitches.

53
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,996
No batter, no batter.

54
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:12,589
No batter anymore.
Take your base.

55
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:16,958
I didn't mean to hit you.
I have trouble with depth perception.

56
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,430
Yeah. Me too, now.

57
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:24,951
Hey, batter, batter, batter, batter.
Hey, duck.

58
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,111
Take your base.

59
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,712
Please, I want to live.

60
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:34,316
Can I use bat to protect head?
Apparently not.

61
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:38,510
Check out the one-Eyed bean machine.

62
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:44,033
Hooray, I make a score point.

63
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:47,559
You beaned a run in.
Better let me pitch.

64
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:53,193
But I've got a no-Hitter going.
You're right. Here.

65
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:58,793
Don't take her out.
She's a firecracker.

66
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:02,917
I'd like to talk to you.
Am I under arrest?

67
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:08,154
You're the sleaze bag who owns
the Ultimate Robot Fighting League.

68
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,790
Now I'm the sleaze bag who
owns the New New York Mets.

69
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:14,508
The Mets?
Those bums are worse than me.

70
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:19,510
But they don't draw a crowd like you.
Which is why I want to sign you.

71
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:24,914
You mean, I'd be the first woman
ever to play major league blernsball?

72
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,991
It'd be a publicity stunt.

73
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:30,715
A one-Eyed lady might bring
out the freak show crowd.

74
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:35,238
Wow, the first woman ever to
play major league blernsball.

75
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:38,756
Again, yeah. But you'd just be...
Yippee!

76
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:50,393
The first woman ever to play major
league blernsball. How do I look?

77
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:54,713
Like a sexy Yogi Berra.
Why is your number 7/8?

78
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,876
The whole numbers have been retired.

79
00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:00,277
I'm impressed.
You look just like a ball player.

80
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:03,552
Can I pat you on the butt?
I'm a professional athlete.

81
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:05,910
So go ahead.

82
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,798
Now I'm too nervous.

83
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:23,151
The Swedes have already turned
this one into a "laffer".

84
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:27,871
And that's with two "F's."
The crowd is pouring out L.A. -Style.

85
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:34,429
Skipper, we're losing the crowd.
Put in our new novelty act, Leela.

86
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:37,399
I already put in the circus clown.

87
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:41,315
But he bunted. Clowns are only
funny when they swing away.

88
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:47,231
<i>Your attention please.
Pitching for the Mets, Turanga Leela.</i>

89
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:51,114
<i>A one-Eyed woman.</i>

90
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,636
Come on, throw like a girl.

91
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:58,634
Go, Leela.
Too much eyeliner.

92
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:01,235
This is history in the making.

93
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:04,989
Bjornson steps up to the plate,
and Leela delivers.

94
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,597
Bull's-Eye.

95
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:13,834
An inauspicious start for the career
of the first woman blernsballer.

96
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:21,480
An inauspicious continuation for the
career of the first woman blernsballer.

97
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:35,835
Bean! Bean! Bean! Bean! Bean...

98
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:46,629
It's a three-Bean, ball salad.
The Mets fans love it, though.

99
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:50,793
They haven't had much
to cheer about this year.

100
00:08:55,680 --> 00:09:00,356
That was great. You got more publicity
than a cowboy in a shark tank.

101
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,795
Poor Tex. He was quite a shark.

102
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:09,835
Hey!
Come on!

103
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:13,197
I win.
Sorry.

104
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:19,236
How did you get in here?
As your agent, I have access.

105
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,429
Since when are you my agent?

106
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:22,795
Quiet! Call coming in.

107
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:27,830
Yes? A big endorsement
deal for Leela? How much?

108
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:32,915
You put a one and two zeros in
front of that, or we pass. Deal.

109
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:37,511
That's great. How much did you get me?
One hundred dollars!

110
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:44,394
As a pitcher, I serve
up plenty of bean balls.

111
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:47,552
So I know good beans when I see them.

112
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:53,352
Bean-Bay Beans! They're the beaniest!
Cut!

113
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:57,318
Bean! Bean! Bean!

114
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:00,757
In short order,
Leela has become a fan favorite.

115
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,313
You're the best, babe. Hang on.

116
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:20,714
You put a one and two zeros in
front of that, or we pass. Deal.

117
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:24,555
So, what did you get me?
A thousand and one pesos.

118
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:40,989
Cut. Now do one with the bean suit on.

119
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:48,636
Leela bringing in customers.

120
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:52,111
This keep up, we need to
buy second sauce toilet.

121
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:57,599
I want to injure men by throwing stuff
at them, just like you. Will you sign?

122
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:02,911
Sure thing, sweetie.
Who should I make it out to?

123
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,389
To eBay?

124
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:08,713
That's a popular name today.
Little "E," big "B"?

125
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:19,036
Five bucks an autograph, 200 fans,
add a one and two zeros, we got a wad.

126
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:24,229
I'm doing it for all the female
athletes who need a role model.

127
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:28,712
A role model for how to stink.
What? Who are you?

128
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:32,396
Jackie Anderson.
I'm on the team at NNYU.

129
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:35,029
I was hoping to play in the majors.

130
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:37,196
Following in my footsteps.

131
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,910
God forbid! Your freak show
is making it impossible...

132
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,953
For female players
to be taken seriously.

133
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:47,675
I hope you're proud of yourself.

134
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:59,434
Show's over, no refunds.
You heard the robot. Get out!

135
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:07,315
Fans haven't been cheering for me.
They've been cheering at me.

136
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:12,230
Don't be upset, Leela.
You look really cute in your uniform.

137
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:17,594
That's what makes it so sad!
I thought I was doing something heroic!

138
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:22,828
You are! What about that little girl
you visited in the hospital who died?

139
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:26,350
You're right.
I can't let people down anymore.

140
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:31,634
God's my witness, I vow to earn the
respect of girls and women everywhere!

141
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:35,992
I will become the best
blernsball player of all time!

142
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:41,718
That's statistically impossible. In 77
innings, you haven't gotten one out.

143
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:45,708
At this rate, you'll be the
worst player of all time.

144
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:49,708
Oh. Then I have a new vow.
I solemnly swear

145
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:55,119
I will become not the worst
blernsball player of all time!

146
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:17,119
Look! The players who broke
the various color barriers!

147
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:22,394
When will man learn that all races
are equally inferior to robots?

148
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:29,958
If I could be just a little better
than him, I can hold my head high.

149
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:34,193
He once struck out when his
tongue stuck to a cold bat.

150
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:38,552
He tried to catch with an oven mitt!
It's a crummy hologram.

151
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:42,196
I'm not a hologram.
Hank Aaron the 24th.

152
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:46,956
How could you play so badly?
The original Hank Aaron was great!

153
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,798
I was better than great.

154
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:52,555
I was the home run king.
Neat!

155
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:56,196
So, Hank, the bad Hank,
just how bad were you?

156
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:58,351
My batting average was low.

157
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:03,350
Low? It was zero! You went your
whole career without getting a hit.

158
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:07,519
Leela beats that. She pitched
without ever getting an out!

159
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:11,912
You stink! Junior, she belongs
in the exhibit instead of you!

160
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:15,032
Forget it!
This job's too cushy to give up.

161
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:21,869
Wade Boggs, goes down smooth.
I don't want to be in this exhibit.

162
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:26,676
I need your help, so I can be one
tiny iota less pathetic than you.

163
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:30,668
I can't help you play better
than Tiny lota. He was great!

164
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:33,075
But I'll teach you all I know.

165
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:40,519
Okay, let's see what you can do.
She can lodge a ball in your brain.

166
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:43,314
You better get a batting helmet.

167
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:48,711
All right, low and away.

168
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:59,957
Okay, try it again. But this time,
keep your eye off the ball.

169
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,912
You mean on the ball?

170
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:06,750
Who's in the hall of fame?
You're holding the bat upside down.

171
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:11,715
Just pitch the ball!
Okay, eye off the ball.

172
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:17,072
Strike!
Man, you did it, Leela!

173
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:21,956
I didn't hit the batter! I was
pitching and not just belly-Itching!

174
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:26,398
Oh, you got that too?
I think there's a rash going around.

175
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:41,194
Welcome to Fenway where the Mets end
a season that ranks among the worst.

176
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:45,471
You opened a franchise!

177
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:49,116
Yes. Our biggest seller
is Leela's Bean Pizza!

178
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:52,915
Six kinds of beans plus
things that look like beans.

179
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,712
Beans, huh?

180
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:59,518
This is great!
How do you make the crust so fizzy?

181
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:01,711
Ancient Signoid secret.

182
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:06,317
My husband, some hotshot.
Here's his ancient Signoid secret.

183
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:10,550
Live hornets.
We smoosh them right into dough.

184
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:13,911
I don't care if it's horse manure.
That's good.

185
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:17,749
I want to buy this franchise.
How's $ 100,000?

186
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:21,316
No! We come to Earth to
make pizza, not money!

187
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:25,274
No, Blek! Other way around.
Right. Offer accepted!

188
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:32,752
Fans, Boston's turning the last
game into a real "squeeeker".

189
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:38,597
And that's with three "E's"! Two men on,
and they're down to their last out.

190
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:42,759
It's my last chance to prove
I'm not the worst player ever.

191
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,436
Put me in.
No! We're actually winning this game!

192
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:52,232
You only go in as a joke
when we're eight runs behind!

193
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:55,359
Come on!
Let's see some fundamentals out there!

194
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:58,989
And not clown fundamentals!

195
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:10,112
Darn! Darn! Darn!
Now the bases are loaded!

196
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:13,357
Isn't there a man who
can get one more out?!

197
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:16,751
I can!
I repeat. Isn't there a man on...

198
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:21,357
I've been training with Hank Aaron!
The Hank Aaron?

199
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:24,233
I've trained with a Hank Aaron.
All right then

200
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:29,514
Get in there and pitch like you've
never pitched like you before!

201
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:34,191
<i>Now pitching for the Mets,
Turanga Leela!</i>

202
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:38,109
Bean! Bean! Bean!
Go, Leela! Go!

203
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:42,275
Go, Leela!
Put it down the pike!

204
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:46,917
Strike him out! Do it for the
hundreds of women everywhere!

205
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:54,149
<i>Now pinch-Hitting for the
Poindexters, Jackie Anderson!</i>

206
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:59,350
Look! College blernsball's
finest female hitter...

207
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:03,229
Making her debut against
the worst female anything.

208
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:08,156
I've never seen anything this weird
and I've seen Mr. Belvedere naked!

209
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:11,034
Keep cool.
She's like any other player.

210
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:14,710
She puts on her sports
bra one arm at a time.

211
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:20,315
Strike one!

212
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:24,509
Strike one! A personal best!

213
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:28,229
Strike two!

214
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:34,155
This moment is brought to
you by Month Old Franks...

215
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:37,198
The hot dogs with experience!

216
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:25,232
A grand slam blern! The Mets lose!
Their season is over!

217
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:29,194
Leela, the first woman
ever to reach the majors...

218
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:33,592
Will go down as the worst player
in the history of blernsball.

219
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:37,634
She's taught the world that
being a bum knows no gender.

220
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:41,917
Tonight we've seen the
start of a great career...

221
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:47,439
For the first woman to play
the sport well, Jackie Anderson!

222
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:54,237
Leela?
Jackie. I guess you were right...

223
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:58,314
I'm a lousy role model. I'm sorry.
No, don't be.

224
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:02,718
You were an inspiration after all.
I was?

225
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:09,268
You were so awful that women set out
to prove they don't stink as bad as you.

226
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:13,871
That's so kind of you.
I guess I made a difference after all.

227
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:16,719
You absolutely did, Leela.
Now please

228
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:20,919
Please retire. Immediately.

229
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:24,270
Hey, kid! Catch.

230
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:37,115
You're still the worst
football player of all time.

231
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:38,833
Yeah.

232
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:41,116
Yeah.
