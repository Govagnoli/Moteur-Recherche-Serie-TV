1
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:09,276
Bicyclops Built for Two

2
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:41,519
Good news, everyone!

3
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:46,919
Several years ago, I tried to log on
to AOL, and it just went through!

4
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:48,633
We're online!

5
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:54,233
Go ahead, get into these Net Suits.
I designed and tested them myself.

6
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:56,356
It smells like burning monkey.

7
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:01,833
Oh? I guess when you're around it all
day, you stop noticing. Off you go!

8
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:14,796
Behold! The Internet!!

9
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:23,670
My God! It's full of ads!

10
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:41,634
Follow me!

11
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:49,109
It's immense!

12
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:52,949
It's got every piece of information
one could ever want.

13
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,559
So I see!

14
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:58,358
What's going on here?

15
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,710
- That's me!
- No, it isn't!

16
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:16,080
I just took some pictures of your face
and put them on someone else's body.

17
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:21,639
Are you over 18?

18
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:30,800
I'm telling you, they've got a chat
room for everybody. Here it is!

19
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,871
That is so gross!

20
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,270
Yeah. I'll stick with this one.

21
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:53,511
Hi. I'm a naughty nurse,
and I really need someone to talk to.

22
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,478
$9.95 a minute.

23
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:59,195
You're a dollar naughtier than most.

24
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,118
How about them Knicks?

25
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,634
Hello? Any girls in this room at all?

26
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:11,549
Yeah, bring on the hot chicks
because I'm a hot stud!

27
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:15,389
- So are we!
- I'm a woman, if that's what you mean.

28
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,631
I don't play games,
so I'll say I'm a Cyclops...

29
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:22,872
...a space captain,
the only one of my species...

30
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,758
...and I want to meet a man.

31
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:27,151
A woman? I'm scared!

32
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,278
Thanks to the Internet,
I'm bored with sex.

33
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:34,358
Any website to satisfy
my lust for violence?

34
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,551
Is the space pope reptilian?

35
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,793
Get ready for fun, Fry.

36
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:42,396
Nowadays, we have a game
played entirely on video.

37
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,477
We call it a video game.

38
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,517
Video game, you say?

39
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,312
Well, golly gee!

40
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:53,270
You mighty spacemen of the future
will have to show me how it works.

41
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:25,312
The doctor is in!

42
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,676
The doctor is out.

43
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:35,352
Please sign off. We have a delivery.
Plus, I have to use the phone...

44
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:48,990
Leela, please tell the others that...

45
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,788
Who are you?

46
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:26,396
Saw you in the chat room,
but I couldn't talk to you.

47
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:30,235
After all these years of searching
for another Cyclops.

48
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:33,796
I've dreamed of this moment
all my life!

49
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,673
Do you think, perhaps, you and I...?

50
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:44,518
Idiot! Ever since I was abandoned
on Earth...

51
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,917
...I've been searching
for my people, my planet.

52
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,799
I meet another Cyclops,
and you blast him!

53
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:53,599
That was my one chance
to learn who I am!

54
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:57,753
Oh, I feel terrible.
If there's anything I can ever do...

55
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,359
Gotcha!

56
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:04,351
I won! I'm the greatest!

57
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:10,472
Come on, we have work to do!

58
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:20,709
Are you still mad at me for wrecking
your only chance...

59
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,269
...to learn the meaning
of your life?

60
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,396
I'm just happy you won a game.

61
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:31,869
Now let's get this desperately needed
popcorn to the people of Cineplex 14.

62
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:34,315
<i>Leela, you've got mail!</i>

63
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,676
<i>It's not spam!</i>

64
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,911
- It's him!
<i>- To Leela.</i>

65
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,071
<i>Sub</i>j<i>ect: I am Alcazar.</i>

66
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:46,438
<i>I got your screen name before</i>
<i>being shot by that moron.</i>

67
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:47,675
Kicked your ass.

68
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,273
W<i>e have to talk.</i>

69
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:53,792
<i>Come</i> j<i>oin me on the planet</i>
<i>of your birth. Coordinates follow.</i>

70
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:59,079
Too bad we gotta make
that urgent popcorn delivery.

71
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:01,872
It'll get there.

72
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:29,593
After a lifetime of searching,
I may have found where I belong.

73
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,956
Too bad it's a dump.

74
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:37,269
Look, that statue's only got
one eye!

75
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,954
- Lazy sculptor.
- Welcome home, Leela.

76
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,229
Alcazar?

77
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:45,556
Are you real, or am I seeing single?

78
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:47,074
Of course I am.

79
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:50,471
After all this time,
somebody else with one eye...

80
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:54,189
...who isn't a clumsy carpenter
or a kid with a BB gun.

81
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:57,636
It's all right.
You'll never be alone again.

82
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:02,511
Come, let me introduce you
to yourself.

83
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:06,275
- Do you mind if your servants walk?
- Not at all.

84
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:16,549
We are the last Cyclopses.
Our planet is Cyclopia.

85
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:19,951
The capital, Cyclops City.
Am I going too fast?

86
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:24,716
So much information. Yet, somehow
I feel as if I know it already.

87
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:28,714
This sacred mosaic depicts
our goddess of beauty.

88
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:30,996
Any artwork of her from the back?

89
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,838
You have the same eye.

90
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,437
Had our race survived, you'd be a
temple priestess, or a supermodel.

91
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:39,517
Oh, please. Really?

92
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:53,710
The pirate Purple-Beard,
scourge of the Six Seas.

93
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:54,909
What's that?

94
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:58,197
The Forbidden Valley,
where no one may tread.

95
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:01,397
Is that like a cemetery?
Because I have to pee.

96
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:05,878
Fry, that's offensive to our people!
Isn't it?

97
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,514
This is my home.

98
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:13,911
I hope you'll pardon me for living
in a giant castle.

99
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:16,873
Of course.
If anything, I'm more impressed

100
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:23,873
I'm gonna need to make some room!

101
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:29,070
Here I dream Ionely dreams
and cook simple meals.

102
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:33,478
It's all so sad.
What happened to our people?

103
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:42,068
It's too painful to speak of now.
I'll show you your rooms.

104
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,799
I heard you from my room.
What's wrong?

105
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,758
Nothing. It's just...

106
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,959
I don't want tears
in your perfect eye.

107
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:22,910
Is it about the fate of our people?
Because I'm very interested in that.

108
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:26,550
Okay. But it's chilly.
You'll be all wet with tears.

109
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,392
Let's go into my chamber.

110
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:34,953
<i>It wasn 't long ago our people</i>
<i>were happy and prosperous.</i>

111
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:39,398
<i>But the eyeless Mole People</i>
<i>grew</i> j<i>ealous of our visual prowess.</i>

112
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:44,076
<i>They fired missiles in all directions,</i>
<i>hoping to hit Cyclopia.</i>

113
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:48,154
<i>Unfortunately,</i>
<i>one of the 40 planets hit was ours.</i>

114
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:51,357
- How far away, do you think?
- A trillion miles?

115
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:58,711
Things got hot. You look a little hot,
actually. Take off that jacket.

116
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:02,395
Our people don't like heat.
Just before the impact...

117
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:06,269
<i>... our smartest scientists</i>
<i>saved one baby.</i>

118
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:15,389
Alcazar, I used to be a baby.
It might have been me!

119
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:17,790
<i>Fortunately, I was a pool cleaner.</i>

120
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:23,398
<i>And when I emerged from retrieving a</i>
<i>dead possum, I was the only one left.</i>

121
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:24,789
It's so tragic.

122
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:28,589
Yes. But the real tragedy
is that our race ends with us.

123
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,756
- It doesn't have to.
- You mean?

124
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,679
You're a male, and I'm a female.

125
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:36,475
I'm still not following you.

126
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:50,512
Wake up, my king.

127
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:59,310
Jeez, what a night.
Make me some coffee, would you?

128
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:02,916
- Sure. What else with that?
- Pancakes and sausage.

129
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,798
Kitchen's in the basement.

130
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:09,238
After breakfast, we can talk
about rebuilding our civilization.

131
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,554
Great pancakes.

132
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:21,072
Yeah, they'll come in handy
if I need to cover any tiny manholes.

133
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:28,839
We don't want to look like slobs
in front of the others.

134
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:33,551
Do these dishes, and organize my
collection of naked celebrity photos.

135
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,551
- Look, Alcazar...
- Call me Al.

136
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:39,918
I know you were living alone
for a long time. I can sympathize.

137
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,308
But I'm not a maid.

138
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:44,870
You're right. I'm sorry.
I guess it won't work.

139
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,554
So much for the Cyclops race.

140
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:50,354
Okay, okay. I'll do the dishes.

141
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:53,074
Hey, where'd they go?

142
00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:03,112
Leela's experiencing a woman's greatest
joy, worshiping a lowlife jerk.

143
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:06,551
He may be a lowlife jerk,
but I don't trust him.

144
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:09,553
He's hiding something,
I'll find out what.

145
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:17,276
Try and stop me!

146
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:21,629
Al?

147
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:25,071
I did my hair the way you wanted it.

148
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:29,633
- Who are these people?
- Friends.

149
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:33,799
Where'd you get this couch,
and that TV set, all this stuff?

150
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:38,875
They were giving it away on the
corner. Just like you, Leela.

151
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:42,750
Too bad they weren't giving away
what you need:

152
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:46,879
Mouthwash, a back wax
and stain-proof underwear.

153
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,513
You go, girl!

154
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:53,635
Fry's in the dungeon. Feed him so he
doesn't die and stink up the place.

155
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:56,439
Can't you let the little guy out?

156
00:13:56,640 --> 00:14:00,235
Jeez, Leela! Twice in one day?
I'm not Superman!

157
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:09,400
Why did you go
to the Forbidden Valley?

158
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,949
Because Alcazar's hiding something.

159
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:15,994
You may not like it, believe it
or want to hear it.

160
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:18,549
Alcazar's a jerk. He's bad for you.

161
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,836
- I know.
- You do?

162
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:25,909
If it's obvious to you, with your
learning disability, of course I knew!

163
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:28,594
He's gross and treats me like a slave.

164
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,392
Dump his one-eyed ass!

165
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:34,513
I can't. If I leave him,
that's the end of the Cyclops race.

166
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:39,788
I won't let that happen, even if it
means a lifetime of unhappiness.

167
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:43,669
Leela? Mop-up in aisle number two!

168
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:48,316
- I'll break up with him at dinner.
- I'll be there.

169
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:53,438
Leela! Pig says your slop
tastes like crap!

170
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:55,790
Yeah. Like crap.

171
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:59,270
You deserve better than this guy.
Dump him already.

172
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:01,311
I'm trying.

173
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:04,791
Hey, everyone,
jam a sock in your spit faucets.

174
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:09,670
I used to spend nights renting
slasher flicks with Rat and his girl.

175
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:12,957
Then a beautiful woman arrived...
Stop eating!

176
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:16,636
She brought new hope for me
and our civilization.

177
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:21,749
A million centuries of Cyclops destiny
depend on the answer to one question:

178
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:24,673
Leela, will you marry me?

179
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,108
No! No!

180
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:27,918
Yes! I will!

181
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,949
They're getting married.

182
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:46,520
- Congratulations, Leela!
- This is great!

183
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:49,115
- Glad you could come.
- A magical day!

184
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:50,753
Welcome!

185
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:04,953
Get me out of here!
It's horrible eating scraps...

186
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:08,272
...dropping my waste everywhere,
like an animal.

187
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:12,399
- Animals go in the corner.
- Why didn't I think of that?

188
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:17,198
I'd like to help you, but it's my
wedding and I'm kind of busy.

189
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:21,115
Here, try to be happy for me.
At least one of us will be.

190
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:26,277
That's it!
It's time for this bird to walk.

191
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:39,313
We've gotta get some dirt on Alcazar!

192
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:42,438
Let's see why it's called
Forbidden Valley!

193
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,238
No, thanks, I'm good.

194
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:46,874
You can steal some forbidden stuff.

195
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:53,030
I don't know. For the first time in my
life, I feel like I've stolen enough.

196
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:56,120
Bender, snap out of it!

197
00:16:56,360 --> 00:17:00,273
Sorry, I don't know what came over me.
Let's go!

198
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:04,035
<i>I love stealing</i>
<i>I love taking things</i>

199
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:18,076
That pig over there is wearing
the same sandals as me.

200
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:24,630
Come on, boy. Jump! Good boy!

201
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:27,480
Whoa, Mittens.

202
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:32,352
My God! Four identical castles!

203
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:35,757
Each more identical than the last!

204
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:40,474
Weird. It's another Cyclops,
only this one has five eyes.

205
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:44,275
And here's another one with no eyes.

206
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:47,712
Does anyone have a reason
why this couple...

207
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:53,153
...shall not be joined in the
irrevocable shackles of holy bliss?

208
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:58,076
Saving a race of one-eyed monsters?
Who could object to that?

209
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,109
Cut to it, preach.

210
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:03,795
Do you take this woman...
in sickness... Iove... do part?

211
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:05,234
I do. Faster!

212
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:10,594
Do you, Leela, copy and paste his
response, till death do you part?

213
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:19,078
I...

214
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,399
Oh, my God!

215
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:29,677
Hey, Alcazar? You left somebody
off the guest list.

216
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:35,193
Why you are so late for our wedding?
And why you have only one eye?

217
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:43,114
Hey, sweetie. Just go back to the
castle and wait for me.

218
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:48,798
I can morph into a five-eyed alien,
and I kind of said I'd marry her.

219
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:52,794
But I'm really a Cyclops,
and I'm really going to marry you.

220
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:56,669
Oh, yeah? Then what about this?

221
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:02,354
- This is a bit awkward.
- Who's she?

222
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:05,199
- Who are they?
- Go back to the castle.

223
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:08,352
And maybe you'd like to meet her?
And her?

224
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:16,038
Leela, this must all be
very confusing.

225
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:21,274
A little. That's why I've decided
to hurt you until you explain it.

226
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,309
- Show us your real form!
- Yeah!

227
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:28,635
Do it!

228
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:45,119
Well, this is the real me.
But I can explain. We all have needs.

229
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:49,069
I needed five weirdos to scrub
my five castles.

230
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:51,595
I gave you what you wanted
and made money...

231
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:54,228
...letting Pig watch
through a two-way mirror.

232
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:58,911
Can any of you say you wouldn't
have done the exact same thing?

233
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:00,399
He's a saint!

234
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:03,398
But why all five weddings
on the same day?

235
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:06,558
You know the price to rent
a tux that changes shape?

236
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:11,197
- I just have one last question.
- What?

237
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:17,157
If you can change form, why not change
it in the one place that counts?

238
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:30,078
- Thanks for saving me from that creep.
- Hey, that's what I do.

239
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:35,075
I was so desperate to find out who I
really was, I forgot who I really was.

240
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:38,630
No harm done. In the decades
you'll work to repay me...

241
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:40,916
...for that popcorn you destroyed...

242
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:45,438
...you'll have plenty of time
to search for your true home.

243
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:49,878
I mean, how many planets can there be?
