1
00:00:07,213 --> 00:00:09,329
Bendless Love

2
00:00:33,733 --> 00:00:35,132
- Guidance system?
- Online.

3
00:00:35,293 --> 00:00:36,567
<i>- Autopilot?
- Present.</i>

4
00:00:36,733 --> 00:00:38,928
- Dark-matter indicator?
- Making a noise.

5
00:00:39,093 --> 00:00:41,527
All systems operational.
Let's rock.

6
00:00:55,853 --> 00:00:59,084
Gentlemen, I've completed
my report on the crash.

7
00:00:59,293 --> 00:01:02,251
I'm not reading that!
Summarize it in one word.

8
00:01:02,413 --> 00:01:03,482
Sabotage.

9
00:01:04,853 --> 00:01:09,404
This is a normal L-unit. Without it,
space travel is the dream of a madman.

10
00:01:09,573 --> 00:01:11,643
- Yep.
- It's an important unit.

11
00:01:11,853 --> 00:01:17,485
And this, my friends, is the L-unit
I just removed from the ship.

12
00:01:18,013 --> 00:01:20,971
That's not an L!
Unless you count lowercase.

13
00:01:21,133 --> 00:01:22,964
You know we don't!

14
00:01:23,173 --> 00:01:28,201
Whoever did this was strong. This
is 340 pounds of Tonka-tough steel.

15
00:01:28,373 --> 00:01:32,651
It should look like this:
But, instead, it looks like this:

16
00:01:32,853 --> 00:01:36,129
- Who would do that?
- Who could do that?

17
00:01:36,373 --> 00:01:39,331
And by "that," I mean this:

18
00:01:39,533 --> 00:01:42,843
It looks like we have
another mystery on our hands.

19
00:01:43,053 --> 00:01:48,923
I'd better make a chart of suspects.
I'll draw a line with my straightedge.

20
00:01:49,093 --> 00:01:52,722
Sweet lamprey of Santa Fe!
My edge has been bent!

21
00:01:54,093 --> 00:01:57,642
My javelin too!
It's ruined!

22
00:01:57,813 --> 00:02:00,168
Now we'll never beat Jupiter State!

23
00:02:00,933 --> 00:02:06,405
My Slinky!
My cuddly little pet Slinky!

24
00:02:07,373 --> 00:02:10,012
What's all the hubbub?

25
00:02:10,173 --> 00:02:12,289
Even the professor's been bent.

26
00:02:12,453 --> 00:02:16,241
Thank you for your sympathy,
talking square of linoleum.

27
00:02:16,413 --> 00:02:18,290
I'll get you fixed up.

28
00:02:19,533 --> 00:02:23,811
- That's fine.
- What did you do to the professor?

29
00:02:23,973 --> 00:02:25,247
I bent him.

30
00:02:25,413 --> 00:02:27,244
- Aha!
- It's Bender!

31
00:02:27,453 --> 00:02:32,607
A bunch of stuff gets bent, so it must
be the robot designed for bending.

32
00:02:32,813 --> 00:02:36,283
I know, we'll check last night's
surveillance tapes.

33
00:02:36,453 --> 00:02:38,364
- Tapes?
- You've seen me naked?

34
00:02:42,533 --> 00:02:46,845
<i>Last night's tape. It was right next
to Bathroom Bloopers Four.</i>

35
00:02:53,293 --> 00:02:56,205
See? Nothing! I told you, losers!

36
00:02:56,413 --> 00:02:59,610
Wait, there on the screen!
It's that guy you are!

37
00:02:59,773 --> 00:03:03,686
- I'm sleepwalking!
- We've got robots on the ceiling.

38
00:03:27,213 --> 00:03:29,852
You weren't sleepwalking,
you were sleep-bending.

39
00:03:30,013 --> 00:03:31,332
This is quite a shock.

40
00:03:31,653 --> 00:03:34,372
On the other hand, it's not surprising.

41
00:03:34,533 --> 00:03:39,323
After all, I've been bending
since the day I was built.

42
00:03:40,013 --> 00:03:44,803
<i>I was born on an assembly line
in the bad part of Tijuana.</i>

43
00:03:47,253 --> 00:03:48,242
Mama.

44
00:04:09,093 --> 00:04:10,765
Hooray! I graduated!

45
00:04:10,933 --> 00:04:15,529
Time to bend around Europe for
a few months, then get a job bending.

46
00:04:15,733 --> 00:04:19,328
- You remember your birth?
- It was only four years ago.

47
00:04:19,533 --> 00:04:24,209
- You're only four years old?
- Precocious little scamp, ain't I?

48
00:04:26,253 --> 00:04:31,202
Bender must have a need to bend
that's not satisfied by his lifestyle.

49
00:04:31,373 --> 00:04:36,288
He can't stay. He's a menace to every
straight person in the company.

50
00:04:36,453 --> 00:04:38,523
Go satisfy your bend-lust.

51
00:04:38,693 --> 00:04:41,844
And don't you come back
to work until you do!

52
00:04:43,253 --> 00:04:47,690
<i>No more bending, no more work
Give us a raise, you big fat jerk</i>

53
00:04:47,893 --> 00:04:49,406
Nevers!

54
00:04:51,613 --> 00:04:56,607
Yo! The mafia supports you!
But don't tell no one! Spread the word!

55
00:04:56,813 --> 00:04:59,566
As duly elected mobsters
of this union...

56
00:04:59,733 --> 00:05:03,282
...it's our duty to support
the struggle of these slobs.

57
00:05:03,453 --> 00:05:08,402
- What if management is "intragnizent"?
- In context, it's clear what you mean.

58
00:05:08,573 --> 00:05:11,406
In that case, Clamps may have
a surprise for them.

59
00:05:11,573 --> 00:05:13,211
The clamps!

60
00:05:13,413 --> 00:05:15,005
Right?

61
00:05:19,413 --> 00:05:21,165
Aw, no! A strike?

62
00:05:21,573 --> 00:05:25,532
Now I'll never get to bend anything!
Oh, woe is Bender!

63
00:05:25,693 --> 00:05:29,811
Management refused to switch
casual Friday to Monday.

64
00:05:29,973 --> 00:05:33,682
- What?!
- They hire scabs at 1 0 times our wage!

65
00:05:33,893 --> 00:05:38,489
Ten times normal wage!
I'll give those jerks what for!

66
00:05:42,933 --> 00:05:45,572
- Welcomes aboard, scab.
- Great to be here.

67
00:05:45,733 --> 00:05:50,727
I'll introduces you to your scab
coworkers you'll be scabbing with.

68
00:05:51,333 --> 00:05:54,086
This here's our
scab foreman.

69
00:05:54,253 --> 00:05:55,811
- Flexo?
- Bender?

70
00:05:56,213 --> 00:06:01,241
Sorry you got sent to that South
American Turkish prison instead of me.

71
00:06:01,653 --> 00:06:06,522
You bastard! They treated me like
an animal! And that's what I became!

72
00:06:08,573 --> 00:06:11,007
No, you're all right.
Good to see you!

73
00:06:11,173 --> 00:06:15,963
And here's another scab
what also works here, Angleene.

74
00:06:19,093 --> 00:06:20,287
Hello.

75
00:06:21,773 --> 00:06:25,812
Hey, you guys want
to move that things?

76
00:06:29,613 --> 00:06:31,285
Hello!

77
00:06:36,213 --> 00:06:39,569
<i>- Give us a raise, you big fat jerk
- Nevers!</i>

78
00:06:56,693 --> 00:07:00,527
- Hi, Angleene. What you up to?
- Making hangers.

79
00:07:00,733 --> 00:07:04,692
- Counselor said I had a knack for it.
- That's cool.

80
00:07:04,853 --> 00:07:07,811
So, I was wondering if...

81
00:07:08,053 --> 00:07:10,442
You know, it's cool if not, but...

82
00:07:10,613 --> 00:07:14,526
- What are you doing after work?
- What I always do. Jack squat.

83
00:07:15,493 --> 00:07:18,610
Me too. Man, we have a lot
in common, huh?

84
00:07:18,813 --> 00:07:21,885
Well, we are made of virtually
identical components.

85
00:07:22,093 --> 00:07:26,211
Are you sure? Maybe I should
peek at your access panel.

86
00:07:26,573 --> 00:07:31,124
<i>Hey, according to the Scab Handbook,
that's inappropriate banter.</i>

87
00:07:31,373 --> 00:07:34,410
And that's just
the way I like it.

88
00:07:38,293 --> 00:07:40,648
Haile H. Selassie!

89
00:07:40,893 --> 00:07:45,205
There, little friend. Good as new.

90
00:07:49,693 --> 00:07:55,325
What an exquisite day! That azure sky.
The verdant treetops.

91
00:07:55,573 --> 00:08:01,091
Those delightful birds with their chirp,
chirp and their tweet, tweet, splat.

92
00:08:01,293 --> 00:08:04,808
I've never seen you so cheerful.
What's wrong with you?

93
00:08:04,973 --> 00:08:10,969
Seeing things from a new perspective
has reminded me of life's beauty...

94
00:08:11,293 --> 00:08:15,730
...or perhaps my posture is causing
blood to pool in the back of my brain...

95
00:08:15,973 --> 00:08:21,525
...resulting in a mild delirium. By
the way, you have a dime up your nose.

96
00:08:21,733 --> 00:08:23,644
I wish. It's a nickel.

97
00:08:25,053 --> 00:08:31,322
Union forever! Lousy scabs!
They can't do those things! Et cetera!

98
00:08:33,693 --> 00:08:37,481
I bet watching me bend girders
turns your legs rubbery.

99
00:08:37,693 --> 00:08:39,604
My legs are made of rubber.

100
00:08:39,813 --> 00:08:43,010
And anyway, I am just
as strong as you are, Mac.

101
00:08:43,213 --> 00:08:46,410
Oh, yeah? Prove it.

102
00:08:53,053 --> 00:08:56,409
Here. Let me help you.

103
00:09:56,053 --> 00:09:59,602
My new bent outlook
has completely re-energized me.

104
00:09:59,813 --> 00:10:04,284
I'm even dating a young,
Brazilian, retired actress.

105
00:10:04,493 --> 00:10:09,442
Some say I'm robbing the cradle,
but I say she's robbing the grave.

106
00:10:09,813 --> 00:10:13,601
Howdy, doodies! What's new?

107
00:10:15,093 --> 00:10:20,451
I was regaling your former coworkers
with a tale of bedroom antics...

108
00:10:20,653 --> 00:10:24,202
Big whoop, no one cares.
I got Bender-related news.

109
00:10:24,413 --> 00:10:28,850
I'm in love. And I'm taking
all my friends out to celebrate.

110
00:10:29,053 --> 00:10:31,613
Let's get liquored up!

111
00:10:35,573 --> 00:10:39,327
Hey, look at this crowd.
You guys gotta try the pasta.

112
00:10:39,533 --> 00:10:43,924
It's got a nice profit margin. Bam!
So, special occasion tonight?

113
00:10:44,133 --> 00:10:47,443
- You'll never guess what's happened!
- Bam?

114
00:10:47,653 --> 00:10:51,805
- I've met the most dynamite lady-bot.
- Hey, that's terrific!

115
00:10:52,053 --> 00:10:56,410
To celebrate, I'm gonna stick
seven copies of my book on your bill.

116
00:10:56,613 --> 00:10:58,205
Bless you, sir.

117
00:10:58,413 --> 00:11:01,928
So, Bender, tell us about
this new girlfriend of yours.

118
00:11:02,093 --> 00:11:05,608
I intend to, through
the lost art of the toast.

119
00:11:05,853 --> 00:11:08,242
To Angleene. She's got it all.

120
00:11:08,493 --> 00:11:12,611
Looks, charm and the love
of a fabulous bending robot.

121
00:11:12,813 --> 00:11:14,724
She sure does.

122
00:11:19,613 --> 00:11:21,410
Flexo!

123
00:11:24,293 --> 00:11:27,569
Careful, that's a week old.

124
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:37,652
I finally meet a nice girl,
with legs that don't quit...

125
00:11:37,813 --> 00:11:40,452
...and that jerk Flexo
steals her away?

126
00:11:40,693 --> 00:11:44,163
It's time to kick some shiny,
metal ass!

127
00:11:44,853 --> 00:11:49,085
You degenerate hussy!
I'm disappointed in you too, Angleene!

128
00:11:49,293 --> 00:11:54,003
- Bender, it's not what you think!
- God, then it's worse than I think!

129
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:56,966
Now look, there is no reason
to be upset.

130
00:11:57,133 --> 00:12:00,205
- Flexo and I are divorced.
- Div... Huh?

131
00:12:00,413 --> 00:12:03,644
We're just having dinner
to stay friends.

132
00:12:03,893 --> 00:12:07,806
I knew that. What I'm outraged
by is your choice of wine!

133
00:12:08,013 --> 00:12:12,291
- Really, it's the steward's fault.
- Excellent choice, sir.

134
00:12:14,373 --> 00:12:18,730
That Flexo, why, I'm knocking him
on his butt. I can't believe this.

135
00:12:18,973 --> 00:12:23,330
Obsessing won't help, Bender.
Take a lean back and enjoy life.

136
00:12:23,533 --> 00:12:26,843
My fembot may be in love
with another manbot.

137
00:12:27,053 --> 00:12:31,046
Well, talk to her. Tell her your
feelings in an honest way.

138
00:12:31,253 --> 00:12:33,050
Either that, or be a man.

139
00:12:33,893 --> 00:12:36,248
I've constructed an elaborate lie.

140
00:12:36,453 --> 00:12:40,412
I'll call Angleene, pretend
to be Flexo, arrange a date...

141
00:12:40,613 --> 00:12:44,242
...show up as him and catch her
two-timing me with myself.

142
00:12:44,453 --> 00:12:47,206
That's thinking like a man.

143
00:12:49,173 --> 00:12:52,688
Hello? This is Flexo.

144
00:13:02,453 --> 00:13:06,207
Now we'll see who loves whom.

145
00:13:14,093 --> 00:13:16,891
- Hey, hot stuff.
- Hey, Flexo.

146
00:13:17,493 --> 00:13:21,850
Since when do you go to bars
on work nights? It's not like you.

147
00:13:22,053 --> 00:13:24,123
Nonsense. It's exactly like me.

148
00:13:24,293 --> 00:13:28,844
Flexo, the fun-loving love machine
fembots love to love.

149
00:13:29,093 --> 00:13:33,564
I'll have a fuzzy navel. She'll
have the girliest drink in the house.

150
00:13:33,773 --> 00:13:39,006
- Two fuzzy navels coming up.
- I hope they can change a fortune.

151
00:13:39,213 --> 00:13:44,606
Get an eye-load of that scab with the
beard flashing his filthy scab money.

152
00:13:44,853 --> 00:13:46,525
It's an insult, boss.

153
00:13:46,773 --> 00:13:50,846
That cash should be slushing
my fund and kicks-ing my back.

154
00:13:51,053 --> 00:13:54,250
- I'm greasing up my whoozits!
- Whoa. Not yet.

155
00:13:54,493 --> 00:13:58,168
Let's just see if he does it
a couple more times.

156
00:13:58,373 --> 00:14:01,843
- You're looking good.
- Quit making googly eyes.

157
00:14:02,093 --> 00:14:06,245
- I'm in love with Bender.
- Bender? That walking wuss factory?

158
00:14:06,453 --> 00:14:09,729
He may be a walking factory,
but he is no wuss.

159
00:14:09,893 --> 00:14:13,488
You and me are through.
I told you when I divorced you.

160
00:14:13,693 --> 00:14:17,925
Going through a divorce,
tell me that didn't bring us closer.

161
00:14:18,373 --> 00:14:19,362
Care to dance?

162
00:14:19,573 --> 00:14:22,406
You know I love dancing,
but you always hated it.

163
00:14:22,613 --> 00:14:28,006
In that case, it's something
I've always wanted to make up to you.

164
00:14:31,693 --> 00:14:32,842
Hey, Scratch-Mo!

165
00:14:33,093 --> 00:14:36,324
Drop me and the lady
some rump-rattling beats.

166
00:14:36,493 --> 00:14:40,930
I'd hoped by the second time he
flashed cash, my rage would subside.

167
00:14:41,093 --> 00:14:44,210
Sadly, that has not happened.

168
00:14:47,293 --> 00:14:51,605
You used to be so inflexible, Flexo.
You've really loosened up.

169
00:14:51,853 --> 00:14:55,050
I recently upgraded my funk card.

170
00:14:55,293 --> 00:14:57,204
- Come on!
- All right!

171
00:14:57,413 --> 00:14:59,563
Hit me! Come on, now!

172
00:14:59,773 --> 00:15:01,604
What's new?

173
00:15:09,493 --> 00:15:13,008
Flexo, what's going on?

174
00:15:15,653 --> 00:15:17,564
Flexo!

175
00:15:28,693 --> 00:15:35,007
The moral of the story is: If you want
it to stay sunk, tie a weight to it!

176
00:15:36,053 --> 00:15:39,250
Yeah! You always were a kick
in the teeth, man.

177
00:15:39,453 --> 00:15:44,208
Aw, shucks, thunder-buns.
You make me feel like a million volts.

178
00:15:44,413 --> 00:15:49,407
Flexo, I'm starting to remember
why I fell for you in the first place.

179
00:15:49,613 --> 00:15:52,844
<i>So she's falling for Flexo, eh?</i>

180
00:15:53,093 --> 00:15:56,563
<i>I'd better seduce her a little more
just to be sure.</i>

181
00:15:56,893 --> 00:15:59,930
It's late. I should get home
to my trailer.

182
00:16:00,173 --> 00:16:04,928
I'll walk you out. A true gentleman
tends to his date's every need.

183
00:16:05,173 --> 00:16:06,242
Tiparillo?

184
00:16:10,253 --> 00:16:16,203
Here you are, my lad. Bring the lady's
car around in the finest way possible.

185
00:16:16,453 --> 00:16:18,489
He's flashing his cash again.

186
00:16:18,693 --> 00:16:21,526
- How many times is that?
- Three!

187
00:16:21,733 --> 00:16:24,645
That's the necessary number of times.

188
00:16:24,813 --> 00:16:28,089
That scab's gonna have
an on-the-job accident.

189
00:16:28,293 --> 00:16:32,525
Don-bot, I don't think we should
rely on an accident happening.

190
00:16:32,773 --> 00:16:35,333
Let's kill him ourselves.

191
00:16:35,533 --> 00:16:39,162
Well, good night. I had a great time.

192
00:16:39,373 --> 00:16:42,092
How about a lift? To your place?

193
00:16:42,293 --> 00:16:43,851
- What?!
- Admit it...

194
00:16:44,093 --> 00:16:48,405
...you felt something for me tonight.
And by me, I mean Flexo.

195
00:16:48,613 --> 00:16:51,446
- Hey, look. I had fun, but...
- But?

196
00:16:51,693 --> 00:16:55,686
- But...
- But?

197
00:16:58,093 --> 00:16:59,685
But...

198
00:17:08,173 --> 00:17:12,451
- Huh? Bender, you tricked me!
- That's right, baby!

199
00:17:12,613 --> 00:17:16,242
I ain't your lover-boy, Flexo,
the guy you love so much.

200
00:17:16,413 --> 00:17:19,211
You even love anybody
pretending to be him!

201
00:17:19,453 --> 00:17:23,002
Maybe I love you no matter
who you're pretending to be!

202
00:17:23,213 --> 00:17:26,922
Oh, how I wish I could believe
or understand that!

203
00:17:27,173 --> 00:17:32,805
There's only one reasonable course
of action now: Kill Flexo!

204
00:17:33,893 --> 00:17:36,282
No!

205
00:17:45,173 --> 00:17:47,971
Thanks, I appreciate that.
Nah, I'm joshing you.

206
00:17:48,133 --> 00:17:51,205
- That was annoying.
- You call yourself divorced?

207
00:17:51,373 --> 00:17:54,331
You're mocking one
of our oldest institutions!

208
00:17:54,533 --> 00:17:55,966
What?

209
00:17:59,693 --> 00:18:04,926
Give the word and I'll drop this
unbendable girder. Clamp-ka-bamp!

210
00:18:05,133 --> 00:18:10,412
Only kill the one with the beard. That
other scab, we got nothing against.

211
00:18:19,973 --> 00:18:21,167
That's low.

212
00:18:21,373 --> 00:18:23,967
Please stop! I'm not worth it!

213
00:18:24,173 --> 00:18:30,009
Probably not! But I love you, and I'm
gonna kick his ass till I win you back!

214
00:18:34,053 --> 00:18:36,408
Okay, Clamps. Now!

215
00:18:39,853 --> 00:18:41,889
Oh, that's gotta clamp.

216
00:18:43,253 --> 00:18:48,611
- Flexo, are you okay?
- Yeah. Never better.

217
00:18:49,213 --> 00:18:53,047
- I'm yanking your chain. I'm dying.
- You can't die!

218
00:18:53,293 --> 00:18:57,650
- Bender showed me that I love you.
- But I love you.

219
00:18:57,893 --> 00:19:00,612
I know, and I care for you too.

220
00:19:00,813 --> 00:19:05,933
But I could never love anyone as much
as you made me realize I love Flexo!

221
00:19:07,413 --> 00:19:09,608
But...

222
00:19:11,813 --> 00:19:15,965
I love you so much, I want you
to be happy, no matter what.

223
00:19:17,053 --> 00:19:19,442
- What are you saying?
- I'm saying...

224
00:19:19,693 --> 00:19:23,368
...I've got an unbendable
girder to bend.

225
00:19:23,573 --> 00:19:25,803
You can't bend it.
It's unbendable!

226
00:19:25,973 --> 00:19:31,809
I don't know anything about lifting,
so that just leaves us the one option.

227
00:19:55,773 --> 00:19:59,083
Thanks. Another year under that
and I'd have been a goner.

228
00:20:00,013 --> 00:20:02,766
I'll always remember this, Bender.

229
00:20:04,493 --> 00:20:06,927
Me too. Me too.

230
00:20:07,893 --> 00:20:08,928
Jerk.

231
00:20:11,533 --> 00:20:15,651
Flexo and Angleene had sex
right on the factory floor?

232
00:20:15,893 --> 00:20:18,805
- You got bending out of your system.
- Yes.

233
00:20:19,053 --> 00:20:23,012
I won't be up to bending again
for a long, long time.

234
00:20:23,213 --> 00:20:25,807
Perhaps it's your outlook
that needs a bend...

235
00:20:26,053 --> 00:20:31,332
...a bend to a place where happiness
is perpendicular to wonderment.

236
00:20:31,533 --> 00:20:34,650
- We're sick of your upbeat attitude.
- I'll say.

237
00:20:34,853 --> 00:20:38,243
Nonsense. It's just like
in the song I wrote:

238
00:20:38,413 --> 00:20:41,211
<i>We all need a new angle on life</i>

239
00:20:42,293 --> 00:20:43,851
You've gotta help us.

240
00:20:44,093 --> 00:20:47,608
I try to get out, but they keep
pulling me back in!

241
00:20:47,813 --> 00:20:51,488
<i>Wangle a new dangle on life</i>

242
00:20:51,653 --> 00:20:54,963
- No, the other way!
- I like him better this way.

243
00:20:55,173 --> 00:20:59,166
- I'm sad now.
- It's fine.
