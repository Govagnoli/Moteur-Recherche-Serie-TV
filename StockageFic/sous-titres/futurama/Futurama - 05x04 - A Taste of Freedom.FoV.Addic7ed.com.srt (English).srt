00:00:07,333 --> 00:00:09,403
Futurama [5x04] - A Taste Of Freedom - CiWaN

2
00:00:31,493 --> 00:00:34,769
Freedom, freedom, freedom, oy!
Freedom, freedom, freedom, oy!

3
00:00:34,933 --> 00:00:37,606
There's no denying it.
The future's crazy.

4
00:00:37,813 --> 00:00:39,804
Oh, well, don't want to stand out.

5
00:00:39,973 --> 00:00:43,045
Freedom, freedom, freedom, oy!
Freedom, freedom, freedom, oy!

6
00:00:43,253 --> 00:00:47,041
There's nothing crazy about it.
It's just Freedom Day!

7
00:00:54,013 --> 00:00:57,847
So, what is Freedom Day?
Sounds like a feminine hygiene product.

8
00:00:58,013 --> 00:01:00,971
No, it's a fabulous, crab-Ulous day!

9
00:01:01,173 --> 00:01:04,165
If you want to do something, you do it,
and just spleck with the consequences.

10
00:01:05,533 --> 00:01:07,603
You know, like how I live every day.

11
00:01:11,733 --> 00:01:15,772
Happy Freedom Day!
Oh, I think my wrist is broken.

12
00:01:15,973 --> 00:01:20,842
Of course, it wouldn't be Freedom Day
without the traditional Freedom Tub!

13
00:01:22,373 --> 00:01:23,886
Ooh.

14
00:01:24,093 --> 00:01:27,369
Mm. That'll feel nice
on my shattered bones.

15
00:01:30,693 --> 00:01:32,411
Wow, nude hot-Tubbing?

16
00:01:32,613 --> 00:01:34,729
That's all I need to
hear about Freedom Day.

17
00:01:34,893 --> 00:01:37,532
Then consider the
following lecture a bonus.

18
00:01:37,693 --> 00:01:43,211
On Earth, freedom is a given. But on
my planet, we have to suffer for it.

19
00:01:43,693 --> 00:01:46,890
Sure, you can be a comedian
instead of a doctor...

20
00:01:47,053 --> 00:01:50,409
If you want your parents to
roll over in their graves!

21
00:01:52,453 --> 00:01:57,971
Sure, you can vote for Skanadel,
if you want there should be a recession!

22
00:01:58,813 --> 00:02:01,088
Sure, you can go to medical school...

23
00:02:01,253 --> 00:02:05,041
If you've given up on your
dream of being a comedian!

24
00:02:06,293 --> 00:02:07,646
That's why I love Earth.

25
00:02:07,813 --> 00:02:10,771
You can do what you want,
and no one makes you feel guilty...

26
00:02:10,933 --> 00:02:12,082
Because no one cares.

27
00:02:12,253 --> 00:02:15,928
We're not listening!
That's what I'm talking about!

28
00:02:37,333 --> 00:02:40,609
Freedom, freedom, freedom, oy!
Freedom, freedom, freedom, oy!

29
00:02:46,573 --> 00:02:50,725
Excuse me, coming through. Freedom
train arriving on track one. Ooh, ooh!

30
00:02:50,893 --> 00:02:53,612
Ow! You broke my foot!
Freedom.

31
00:02:53,813 --> 00:02:55,804
What's this next float, Linda?

32
00:02:55,973 --> 00:02:59,010
Representing our men, women
and children in uniform...

33
00:02:59,173 --> 00:03:02,404
It's Earth's greatest
space hero, Zapp Brannigan.

34
00:03:02,613 --> 00:03:04,649
Happy Freedom Day, ladies!

35
00:03:04,853 --> 00:03:07,003
Come on, let loose
and show me something.

36
00:03:07,173 --> 00:03:08,162
Anything.

37
00:03:08,333 --> 00:03:09,925
Seriously, I'd take an armpit.

38
00:03:10,533 --> 00:03:13,172
Oh, yeah, thank you, Linda!

39
00:03:14,653 --> 00:03:17,725
You're welcome!
Okay, Morbo, now it's your turn.

40
00:03:17,893 --> 00:03:20,453
If that is your Freedom Day wish .

41
00:03:32,933 --> 00:03:35,493
Thank you, secretary of transportation.

42
00:03:35,653 --> 00:03:40,522
My fellow Earthicans, we enjoy so
much freedom, it's almost sickening.

43
00:03:40,693 --> 00:03:44,686
We're free to choose which hand our
sex-Monitoring chip is implanted in.

44
00:03:44,853 --> 00:03:46,605
If we don't want to pay our taxes...

45
00:03:46,773 --> 00:03:50,083
Why, we're free to spend a
weekend with the Pain Monster.

46
00:03:50,293 --> 00:03:52,170
See you April 15, folks!

47
00:03:52,373 --> 00:03:54,682
Cue the fireworks guy!

48
00:04:03,013 --> 00:04:07,165
Incidentally, tonight's Freedom Day
celebration is brought to you by:

49
00:04:07,893 --> 00:04:10,009
Shankman's Rubbing Compound.

50
00:04:10,173 --> 00:04:12,767
When something needs rubbing,
think Shankman.

51
00:04:12,973 --> 00:04:14,611
Yay, Shankman!

52
00:04:14,813 --> 00:04:16,769
It costs more, but it's worth it.

53
00:04:16,973 --> 00:04:19,885
Our planet has been through
so much this past year.

54
00:04:20,053 --> 00:04:22,726
Wars, droughts, impeachments.

55
00:04:22,893 --> 00:04:26,442
But we've never lost our sense
of what's truly important:

56
00:04:26,613 --> 00:04:29,002
The great taste of Charleston Chew.

57
00:04:31,773 --> 00:04:35,004
And now, let us salute that
beloved symbol of freedom...

58
00:04:35,173 --> 00:04:39,530
Our flag, Ol' Freebie.

59
00:04:44,053 --> 00:04:46,613
I'm swelling with patriotic mucus.

60
00:04:48,093 --> 00:04:52,962
In our darkest hour, we can stand
erect with proud, up-Thrust bosoms.

61
00:04:53,173 --> 00:04:54,686
Anyone who laughs is a Communist.

62
00:04:54,893 --> 00:04:57,487
Knowing that, with a
shifty glance skyward...

63
00:04:57,653 --> 00:05:04,001
We will see by the rocket's red glare,
that our flag is still there.

64
00:05:04,173 --> 00:05:05,322
It's gone!

65
00:05:11,533 --> 00:05:13,888
Yes, fellow patriots! I ate your flag!

66
00:05:14,053 --> 00:05:15,771
And I did it with pride.

67
00:05:15,973 --> 00:05:21,001
For to express oneself by doing a thing,
is the very essence of Freedom Day!

68
00:05:21,173 --> 00:05:25,803
Bless this planet and
all its wonderful people!

69
00:05:27,413 --> 00:05:30,052
Kill him! Kill the traitor!

70
00:05:43,333 --> 00:05:45,642
Hey! It's the guy that
desecrated our flag!

71
00:05:45,813 --> 00:05:47,883
Stop that red menace!

72
00:06:01,653 --> 00:06:04,008
I'm all scuttled out! What?

73
00:06:04,693 --> 00:06:06,331
My planet's embassy?

74
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:09,764
They're paid to not kill me!
Alley-Oop!

75
00:06:16,973 --> 00:06:21,046
I thought I understood this world.
I thought I was fitting in.

76
00:06:21,213 --> 00:06:25,411
But I guess I don't belong here any
more than I do on our crappy home planet.

77
00:06:25,573 --> 00:06:27,131
Sorry.
What sorry?

78
00:06:27,293 --> 00:06:29,011
Our planet stinks. We all know it.

79
00:06:29,173 --> 00:06:31,448
Enough with the persecution, I'm saying.

80
00:06:31,613 --> 00:06:36,243
Zoidberg, as ambassador, I promise
you the full support of our government.

81
00:06:36,413 --> 00:06:39,769
Poor boy. You want
maybe a nice mug cocoa?

82
00:06:41,813 --> 00:06:45,283
Ambassador Mervin,
you and your staff are so kind.

83
00:06:45,453 --> 00:06:47,728
I'm truly humbled.

84
00:06:48,253 --> 00:06:49,971
What, no marshmallows?

85
00:06:51,733 --> 00:06:54,884
Well, let's storm the place!
Without my prior knowledge.

86
00:06:55,093 --> 00:06:57,129
Coming through!
Freedom Train! Step aside.

87
00:06:57,293 --> 00:06:58,646
You, too, fatso. Freedom!

88
00:06:58,813 --> 00:07:00,212
Cool your jowls, Nixon.

89
00:07:00,413 --> 00:07:03,405
You may not like it that
Dr. Zoidberg desecrated a flag.

90
00:07:03,573 --> 00:07:07,452
You may even find the image of it
festering in his bowels offensive.

91
00:07:07,653 --> 00:07:11,612
But the right to freedom of expression
is guaranteed by the Earth Constitution.

92
00:07:11,813 --> 00:07:13,804
Argh-Ooh. Maybe so.

93
00:07:13,973 --> 00:07:16,931
But I know a place where the
Constitution doesn't mean squat!

94
00:07:19,053 --> 00:07:23,205
The Supreme Court hereby accepts
the case of Earth v. Zoidberg.

95
00:07:23,413 --> 00:07:24,402
Sock it to him!

96
00:07:29,173 --> 00:07:33,291
Two, four, six, eight.
Eating the flag is bad!

97
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:36,365
Now, your noose knot
has exactly seven twists.

98
00:07:36,573 --> 00:07:39,371
<i>You can eat my dog...
You can eat my truck...</i>

99
00:07:39,533 --> 00:07:41,842
<i>But you eat my flag...
And you're out of luck...</i>

100
00:07:42,013 --> 00:07:47,246
<i>She's waving proud around the world...
From Dallas to Fort Worth...</i>

101
00:07:47,413 --> 00:07:51,088
<i>Let me say it again...
Don't mess with Earth...</i>

102
00:07:51,293 --> 00:07:53,488
They sure hate Dr. Zoidberg.
Posers!

103
00:07:53,653 --> 00:07:56,087
I was hating Zoidberg
before it was cool.

104
00:07:56,293 --> 00:07:58,807
Where are we gonna find
a lawyer to take his case?

105
00:07:58,973 --> 00:08:01,726
I'll ask the head of the ACLU.
Once he's done singing.

106
00:08:01,933 --> 00:08:05,482
Don 't mess with Earth...

107
00:08:05,693 --> 00:08:07,809
Kill Zoidberg! Good night!

108
00:08:07,973 --> 00:08:09,042
Howdy, there.

109
00:08:09,253 --> 00:08:12,211
I'm a lawyer, and I'd like to help
your friend out of this pickle.

110
00:08:12,413 --> 00:08:15,086
Who are you, old man?
Name's Old Man Waterfall...

111
00:08:15,253 --> 00:08:17,528
But most folks just call me Old Man.

112
00:08:17,733 --> 00:08:18,961
I'll never remember that.

113
00:08:19,173 --> 00:08:20,925
I'm a veteran of three dozen wars.

114
00:08:21,093 --> 00:08:24,768
Name a body part and a planet,
and I've taken a bullet in it, on it.

115
00:08:24,973 --> 00:08:27,646
All to keep our flag flying free.

116
00:08:27,853 --> 00:08:30,447
And you want to defend Zoidberg?

117
00:08:30,613 --> 00:08:34,208
Are you familiar with the old
robot saying, "Does not compute"?

118
00:08:34,373 --> 00:08:38,082
Son, to me a robot's just a garbage
can with sparks coming out it.

119
00:08:38,293 --> 00:08:40,011
The sparks keep me warm.

120
00:08:40,213 --> 00:08:42,249
I don't condone what Dr. Zoidberg did...

121
00:08:42,413 --> 00:08:45,371
But I'll fight tooth and
nail for his freedom to do it.

122
00:08:45,533 --> 00:08:49,924
Or I would, if I hadn't lost my teeth and
nails on Mars and Saturn, respectively.

123
00:08:50,133 --> 00:08:53,011
Wait, you're a lawyer? You're hired!

124
00:08:58,253 --> 00:09:00,244
You okay there in the embassy, Zoidberg?

125
00:09:00,413 --> 00:09:02,688
No! There's no cocoa marshmallows!

126
00:09:02,893 --> 00:09:05,771
And every night, the rats
eat a little more of my foot.

127
00:09:06,173 --> 00:09:07,288
Oyez, oyez, oyez!

128
00:09:07,493 --> 00:09:11,805
All rise for the Honorable Chief Justice
Myrtle Foo and the associate justices!

129
00:09:22,493 --> 00:09:25,530
Counsel, you may address the
court on behalf of Earth, if ready.

130
00:09:25,733 --> 00:09:27,610
I was hatched ready.

131
00:09:27,773 --> 00:09:32,847
Honorable judge heads,
yonder crawdad done ate up our flag.

132
00:09:33,053 --> 00:09:36,363
I was doing freedom of speech,
Earth's most sacred right.

133
00:09:36,533 --> 00:09:40,492
Your Honor, freedom of speech applies
to what comes out of a mouth...

134
00:09:40,653 --> 00:09:42,006
Not what goes in.

135
00:09:42,213 --> 00:09:44,966
Can counsel cite precedent?
Yes, darling, I can.

136
00:09:45,133 --> 00:09:48,284
In State of Alabama vs.
Giant Space lguana...

137
00:09:48,453 --> 00:09:50,683
Chewing the corners
off the Constitution...

138
00:09:50,853 --> 00:09:52,571
Was deemed nonprotected speech.

139
00:09:52,773 --> 00:09:54,570
He shut you up, O'Connor.

140
00:09:55,533 --> 00:09:59,492
Mr. Waterfall, you may present
arguments on behalf of Dr. Zoidberg.

141
00:09:59,653 --> 00:10:01,211
Oh, God, I'm nervous.

142
00:10:01,373 --> 00:10:03,409
Two of my three hearts
are having attacks.

143
00:10:04,253 --> 00:10:07,006
Court's kind of fun when
it's not my ass on the line.

144
00:10:07,173 --> 00:10:08,162
Nachos?

145
00:10:08,373 --> 00:10:10,204
Oh, land-O-Goshen.

146
00:10:10,413 --> 00:10:16,090
Your Honors, I'm not some slick
big-City lawyer like my opponent here.

147
00:10:16,293 --> 00:10:18,966
But I am a veteran who
has fought for his planet.

148
00:10:19,133 --> 00:10:21,203
You see this hand of mine?
Yes, I do.

149
00:10:21,413 --> 00:10:22,448
No, you don't!

150
00:10:22,613 --> 00:10:26,686
Because I lost my real hand planting the
flag when we took back Halley's comet.

151
00:10:26,893 --> 00:10:30,647
Yet it was worth it.
So much do I love that flag.

152
00:10:32,813 --> 00:10:35,691
I love it even more than
I love my seven wives.

153
00:10:35,853 --> 00:10:37,445
That's right, I'm a polygamist.

154
00:10:37,653 --> 00:10:39,166
Boo!

155
00:10:39,373 --> 00:10:42,365
Yet I would gladly eat a flag myself...

156
00:10:42,533 --> 00:10:46,685
Had I not used my intestine as a rope
to hoist a flag made of my own skin...

157
00:10:46,893 --> 00:10:51,603
If it would protect the freedoms of
the proud people who salute that flag.

158
00:10:53,853 --> 00:10:55,366
Freedom such as polygamy.

159
00:10:55,533 --> 00:10:58,923
Boo!
I rest my case.

160
00:10:59,613 --> 00:11:00,932
Whoa, jeez.

161
00:11:01,133 --> 00:11:06,161
The justices and I will now confer,
using high-Speed telepathy.

162
00:11:22,813 --> 00:11:24,769
By a vote of six to three...

163
00:11:24,933 --> 00:11:28,926
We find that flag-Eating is not
protected by the Constitution.

164
00:11:30,813 --> 00:11:33,043
Six to three? I beat the spread!

165
00:11:33,253 --> 00:11:36,131
The court orders an
immediate public apology.

166
00:11:36,333 --> 00:11:39,211
Apology accepted.
Just don't let it happen again.

167
00:11:39,373 --> 00:11:44,049
She means you, you turkey of the sea.
Me, apologize? Never!

168
00:11:44,253 --> 00:11:47,051
I came to this planet to
learn the meaning of freedom!

169
00:11:47,213 --> 00:11:50,091
But I say it's you who
should get a nice lesson.

170
00:11:50,253 --> 00:11:51,242
So do your worst...

171
00:11:51,413 --> 00:11:54,962
Because no punishment could be
bigger than denying me my freedom!

172
00:11:55,173 --> 00:11:58,006
You are hereby sentenced to death.

173
00:11:58,213 --> 00:12:00,010
Wait, let me finish.

174
00:12:01,253 --> 00:12:06,725
Also, in a rare double-Whammy decision,
the court finds polygamy constitutional.

175
00:12:06,933 --> 00:12:08,332
Boo!

176
00:12:08,533 --> 00:12:10,330
I can't wait to tell my husband!

177
00:12:10,533 --> 00:12:12,569
Boo!

178
00:12:13,373 --> 00:12:17,048
Remember, men, take him alive so
there's something left to kill.

179
00:12:20,013 --> 00:12:21,048
Stay back!

180
00:12:21,253 --> 00:12:25,212
This embassy is sovereign mud
of the mud planet Decapodian!

181
00:12:25,413 --> 00:12:28,405
Invading these mud
premises is an act of war!

182
00:12:28,613 --> 00:12:31,446
Yeah? Well, what are you
gonna do about it, shrimpy?

183
00:12:31,653 --> 00:12:34,042
You wanna see, Mr. Bigshot?

184
00:12:34,693 --> 00:12:36,490
Attack Earth!

185
00:12:36,653 --> 00:12:38,962
Yes, I know it's a schlep. Just do it!

186
00:12:49,333 --> 00:12:52,609
Aha! Now the rubber
band's on the other claw!

187
00:12:56,053 --> 00:12:58,169
Ready? Retreat!

188
00:13:25,973 --> 00:13:27,804
Deny my freedom, will you?

189
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:31,602
Well, we'll do to you what we did to
the Squash men of the Squash planet:

190
00:13:31,773 --> 00:13:33,491
Squished them!

191
00:13:34,013 --> 00:13:35,810
Charleston Chew?
You bet!

192
00:13:43,053 --> 00:13:45,169
All right, Kif.
Let's show these freaks...

193
00:13:45,333 --> 00:13:48,609
What a bloated,
runaway military budget can do.

194
00:13:48,813 --> 00:13:51,486
Bring me the codes for
our global-Defense network.

195
00:13:51,693 --> 00:13:53,331
Aye, aye, sir.

196
00:13:59,813 --> 00:14:02,725
Commence lip identification scan.

197
00:14:04,413 --> 00:14:05,812
No tongue.

198
00:14:11,333 --> 00:14:13,051
We can't be too careful
with these codes.

199
00:14:13,253 --> 00:14:16,404
Rumor has it a double agent
may be aboard this very ship.

200
00:14:17,333 --> 00:14:18,732
I'm watching you.

201
00:14:18,933 --> 00:14:21,891
You, ensign, what's your name?
Hugh Man, sir!

202
00:14:22,093 --> 00:14:24,846
Hugh Man.
Now, that's a name I can trust.

203
00:14:25,013 --> 00:14:28,164
Run down to the central battle
computer and enter these codes.

204
00:14:31,013 --> 00:14:33,607
Sir, there's something
about that ensign that's--

205
00:14:33,773 --> 00:14:37,812
You're damn right there is.
That young lad's gunning for your job.

206
00:14:37,973 --> 00:14:40,328
And he just might get it.

207
00:14:44,653 --> 00:14:45,972
The enemy approacheth.

208
00:14:46,173 --> 00:14:49,290
Lieutenant, fire missile one and
recommend me for another medal.

209
00:14:49,453 --> 00:14:52,206
Make it gaudy. I'm going clubbing later.

210
00:14:53,813 --> 00:14:54,928
Ticktock.

211
00:14:55,133 --> 00:14:57,852
Sir, all planetary
defenses have been disabled.

212
00:14:58,013 --> 00:15:02,006
Perhaps the Decapodians acquired
our secret codes somehow.

213
00:15:02,213 --> 00:15:04,568
Well, Kif, stand by to take the blame.

214
00:15:04,773 --> 00:15:06,570
Steady, steady .

215
00:15:07,373 --> 00:15:08,362
Now!

216
00:15:25,853 --> 00:15:30,324
Dr. Zoidberg, how can you claim to love
freedom, and then enslave all of Earth?

217
00:15:30,533 --> 00:15:32,444
Your planet doesn't deserve freedom...

218
00:15:32,613 --> 00:15:36,242
Until it learns what it is to not
have freedom. It's a lesson, I say!

219
00:15:37,053 --> 00:15:38,042
Ow!

220
00:15:38,213 --> 00:15:40,727
What the hell is this
dirt pile we're building?

221
00:15:40,933 --> 00:15:43,811
None of your beeswax, slave.
You'll find out soon enough.

222
00:15:43,973 --> 00:15:46,646
Just focus on globbing that mud.

223
00:15:46,853 --> 00:15:48,525
Glob!

224
00:15:55,653 --> 00:15:57,132
I'm no good at being a slave.

225
00:15:57,293 --> 00:16:00,046
I'm thinking about graduate
school to become a barber.

226
00:16:00,213 --> 00:16:03,410
This can't go on.
Today is the day we fight back!

227
00:16:03,573 --> 00:16:06,690
It's already 10:00.
Oh, you're right.

228
00:16:06,853 --> 00:16:08,605
Tomorrow is the day we fight back.

229
00:16:08,773 --> 00:16:10,445
Yeah, well, good luck, sister.

230
00:16:10,613 --> 00:16:12,843
All our modern technology is useless.

231
00:16:13,053 --> 00:16:14,372
I know I am.

232
00:16:17,853 --> 00:16:20,413
Hey, wait.
I'm having one of those things.

233
00:16:20,573 --> 00:16:23,087
You know, a headache with pictures.
An idea?

234
00:16:23,253 --> 00:16:24,242
Mm. Mm-Mm-Mm.

235
00:16:29,333 --> 00:16:32,769
Back in my day, we didn't have
your fancy all-Digital weapons.

236
00:16:32,973 --> 00:16:35,282
We still managed to kill
each other just fine.

237
00:16:35,493 --> 00:16:39,372
The crossbow.
A pitiless, elegant killing machine.

238
00:16:39,533 --> 00:16:41,285
The Bender of the 15th century!

239
00:16:41,493 --> 00:16:44,849
Not big enough. We need something
that can take out an entire army.

240
00:16:45,013 --> 00:16:47,447
Something you could
commit a war crime with--

241
00:16:48,133 --> 00:16:49,361
Wow!

242
00:16:50,653 --> 00:16:51,688
Ow.

243
00:16:55,093 --> 00:16:58,927
Earth slaves,
behold the fruit of your labors:

244
00:16:59,133 --> 00:17:01,601
The mobile oppression palace!

245
00:17:03,453 --> 00:17:04,681
Neat!

246
00:17:04,893 --> 00:17:08,169
I don't need to tell you that
occupation forces are expensive.

247
00:17:08,373 --> 00:17:10,728
But with the mobile oppression palace...

248
00:17:10,893 --> 00:17:15,125
A few dignitaries can oppress your
entire planet for pennies a day!

249
00:17:17,333 --> 00:17:18,971
Warships, dismissed!

250
00:17:44,413 --> 00:17:47,007
Do your worst, you sea devils!

251
00:17:47,173 --> 00:17:49,767
I'll make my stand with Ol' Freebie!

252
00:17:49,933 --> 00:17:52,925
You can crush me,
but you can't crush my spirit!

253
00:17:54,013 --> 00:17:55,685
Oh, my spirit!

254
00:17:58,413 --> 00:18:00,847
Great-Grandpa, no!

255
00:18:01,013 --> 00:18:04,369
Another victim of the
mano-Centric male-Ocracy.

256
00:18:04,573 --> 00:18:07,007
Ambassador Mervin, you killed my lawyer!

257
00:18:07,173 --> 00:18:08,162
You're welcome.

258
00:18:08,333 --> 00:18:10,642
He defended my freedom
when no one else would.

259
00:18:10,813 --> 00:18:16,251
He was a good and honorable man.
I request a satanic funeral.

260
00:18:16,413 --> 00:18:18,051
Boo!

261
00:18:18,253 --> 00:18:20,892
Is it possible that all this
slavery and oppression...

262
00:18:21,053 --> 00:18:24,682
Is schmutzing up our freedom lesson?
Take a pill, Zoidberg.

263
00:18:24,853 --> 00:18:27,128
Begin again with the crushing!

264
00:18:34,173 --> 00:18:36,243
You haven't won yet, Mervin!

265
00:18:36,413 --> 00:18:38,643
You didn't expect us to
even go to a museum...

266
00:18:38,813 --> 00:18:41,452
Much less steal this
ancient heat-Seeking missile!

267
00:18:41,653 --> 00:18:43,052
I don't even know you.

268
00:18:51,453 --> 00:18:53,569
Oh, it's gonna make such a mess!

269
00:19:01,853 --> 00:19:03,730
This is your secret plan?

270
00:19:04,453 --> 00:19:08,241
Heat-Seeking missiles are useless
against a mobile oppression palace.

271
00:19:08,413 --> 00:19:11,610
All Decapodian technology
is cold-Blooded, like us!

272
00:19:17,573 --> 00:19:19,962
All eyes on Zoidberg!

273
00:19:20,133 --> 00:19:21,805
Ew.

274
00:19:25,013 --> 00:19:26,685
Hey, I need that to smoke!

275
00:19:29,893 --> 00:19:33,203
Zoidberg, how could you?
I used to think you were cool.

276
00:19:33,413 --> 00:19:35,483
Wait, people of Earth, listen!

277
00:19:35,653 --> 00:19:40,773
Yes, I'm desecrating a flag, but to
preserve the freedom it represents.

278
00:20:00,253 --> 00:20:02,448
Zoidberg, you set us free!

279
00:20:02,653 --> 00:20:04,928
I feel like I could stand to hug you!

280
00:20:05,093 --> 00:20:07,766
I can't, but you know
what I'm trying to say.

281
00:20:07,973 --> 00:20:10,533
Zoidberg! Zoidberg! Zoidberg!

282
00:20:10,733 --> 00:20:15,682
If only they appreciated freedom
this much on my home planet.

283
00:20:15,853 --> 00:20:17,730
Wait a second. They do!

284
00:20:17,893 --> 00:20:21,044
Because this is my home planet!

285
00:20:22,453 --> 00:20:25,604
And now, to raise this
beautiful new flag...

286
00:20:25,773 --> 00:20:31,086
A red lobster that won't ruin
your dinner, Dr. John Zoidberg!

287
00:20:33,893 --> 00:20:35,884
You're a nice man, Nixon.

288
00:20:37,533 --> 00:20:40,843
How's about you take a bite of
the flag for tomorrow's papers?

289
00:20:41,053 --> 00:20:44,648
Oh, I couldn't.
No, no, go ahead. You've earned it.

290
00:20:44,813 --> 00:20:47,122
Well, maybe just a taste.

291
00:20:49,813 --> 00:20:52,281
Now, that's a grand old flag!

292
00:20:52,493 --> 00:20:53,721
All right, Zoidberg!

293
00:20:55,573 --> 00:20:59,407
I wonder what the Shroud
of Turin tastes like.

294
00:21:01,173 --> 00:21:02,367
All right!

295
00:21:35,573 --> 00:21:36,722
Freedom!
