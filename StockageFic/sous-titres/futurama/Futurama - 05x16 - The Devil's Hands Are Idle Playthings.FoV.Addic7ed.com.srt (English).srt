00:00:07,293 --> 00:00:09,363
Futurama [5x16] - The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings - CiWaN

2
00:00:36,333 --> 00:00:37,812
Huh?

3
00:00:40,453 --> 00:00:42,444
I choose to not understand these signs.

4
00:00:45,293 --> 00:00:46,612
Aha!

5
00:00:46,773 --> 00:00:49,287
Bender! I was just not
playing the holophonor.

6
00:00:49,493 --> 00:00:51,563
Yeah, well, you should
try not stinking at it.

7
00:00:51,773 --> 00:00:54,333
Well, I am trying.
I've been taking lessons.

8
00:00:54,533 --> 00:00:56,285
Lessons! Oh, that's rich!

9
00:00:56,453 --> 00:01:00,002
Isn't it time you gave up all hope
of ever improving yourself in any way?

10
00:01:00,213 --> 00:01:02,090
I know I should, but I just can't.

11
00:01:02,253 --> 00:01:04,721
Remember those stomach worms
I had that made me smart?

12
00:01:04,893 --> 00:01:07,566
I could play the holophonor.
And it made Leela like me.

13
00:01:09,653 --> 00:01:12,963
Hey, Bender, as long as you know,
I have a holophonor recital Tuesday...

14
00:01:13,133 --> 00:01:15,727
And I'd really like to
have somebody there. Please?

15
00:01:16,293 --> 00:01:17,931
Fine. I'll go already.

16
00:01:18,093 --> 00:01:21,244
You know, sometimes I wish your
real parents were still alive.

17
00:01:22,053 --> 00:01:24,123
Not often, though.

18
00:01:28,053 --> 00:01:29,042
Hey!

19
00:01:32,493 --> 00:01:34,961
Hello, Mrs. Mellonger.
Hello, Philip.

20
00:01:35,173 --> 00:01:39,052
And you must be Mr. Bender.
Philip's told me so much about you.

21
00:01:39,213 --> 00:01:43,286
Is it true that you're a robot?
I prefer the term "Iove machine. "

22
00:02:04,653 --> 00:02:06,450
Your kid is great.

23
00:02:06,613 --> 00:02:10,367
How hard you say you had to hit him?
Fairly hard.

24
00:02:15,653 --> 00:02:17,325
"The Grumpy Snail. "

25
00:02:24,733 --> 00:02:26,212
Sorry.

26
00:02:35,253 --> 00:02:37,244
It's too grumpy!

27
00:02:41,373 --> 00:02:44,604
No! No! Quit! Stop!
Whoo!

28
00:02:44,813 --> 00:02:47,885
Mr. Bender, I simply
cannot teach your child.

29
00:02:48,093 --> 00:02:50,766
Then good day, madam!

30
00:02:54,093 --> 00:02:57,051
We hope to see you soon for tea.

31
00:02:58,333 --> 00:02:59,402
It's hopeless.

32
00:02:59,613 --> 00:03:03,367
I can hear this great music in my head,
but my stupid hands can't keep up.

33
00:03:03,573 --> 00:03:07,407
You know what always cheers me up?
Laughing at other people's misfortunes!

34
00:03:09,253 --> 00:03:12,006
Hey, guys. You missed a
great delivery to space Earth.

35
00:03:12,173 --> 00:03:14,812
Where you been all afternoon?
At a concert.

36
00:03:15,013 --> 00:03:18,847
Was it jazz noodling?
My ex-Boyfriend Shawn played the sax.

37
00:03:19,013 --> 00:03:22,767
I used to listen for hours while he
sat naked on my couch and improvised.

38
00:03:22,933 --> 00:03:25,606
So musicians really
Rodger your Hammerstein?

39
00:03:25,773 --> 00:03:29,607
Yeah. It's weird.
Shawn was uneducated, unambitious.

40
00:03:29,773 --> 00:03:32,207
He was pasty and hunched.
Pretty boy.

41
00:03:32,413 --> 00:03:37,692
But when he played, I could sense this
incredible, beautiful creative soul.

42
00:03:37,853 --> 00:03:41,528
Then one day I found someone else's
couch fibers on his butt.

43
00:03:41,693 --> 00:03:43,843
I couldn't even believe that.
That's really...

44
00:03:44,013 --> 00:03:46,846
That could be my beautiful
soul sitting naked on her couch.

45
00:03:47,013 --> 00:03:49,322
If I could just learn to
play this stupid thing.

46
00:03:49,493 --> 00:03:50,926
Oh, but you can.

47
00:03:51,133 --> 00:03:53,852
You may have to metaphorically
make a deal with the devil.

48
00:03:54,053 --> 00:03:55,850
And by devil, I mean Robot Devil.

49
00:03:56,013 --> 00:03:58,811
And by metaphorically,
I mean get your coat.

50
00:04:05,613 --> 00:04:09,686
You hit a sour note about
200 years back, Doug!

51
00:04:09,893 --> 00:04:11,406
Let's take it from the top.

52
00:04:12,773 --> 00:04:15,241
Ow!
Bender! Fry!

53
00:04:15,413 --> 00:04:17,881
You've come back for
more eternal damnation!

54
00:04:18,093 --> 00:04:21,688
No, this isn't a religious visit.
Fry just wants holophonor lessons.

55
00:04:21,853 --> 00:04:24,048
Yep. I need to get really
good without practicing.

56
00:04:26,133 --> 00:04:29,762
Hell is full of 10-Year-Olds who
wanted exactly the same thing.

57
00:04:29,933 --> 00:04:32,606
Trouble is, you have what
my old music teacher...

58
00:04:32,773 --> 00:04:36,482
Mrs. Mellonger, calls "stupid fingers. "

59
00:04:36,653 --> 00:04:40,009
With hands like that you'll be
lucky to master a belt buckle.

60
00:04:41,733 --> 00:04:46,090
Now, wouldn't it be nice if you had
a pair of robot hands to replace them?

61
00:04:46,373 --> 00:04:49,171
Sure would. Oh, well, goodbye.

62
00:04:49,333 --> 00:04:50,686
Fry, you smelly idiot.

63
00:04:50,853 --> 00:04:54,084
I think he's willing to make some
kind of deal with the devil with you.

64
00:04:54,253 --> 00:04:56,084
He is? Great!

65
00:04:56,253 --> 00:04:58,687
Wait, what's the catch?
No catch.

66
00:04:58,853 --> 00:05:02,129
I'll merely pick a robot at random
from somewhere in the universe...

67
00:05:02,293 --> 00:05:05,603
Probably one you've never even met,
and then I'll remove his hands...

68
00:05:05,773 --> 00:05:09,243
And switch them for yours.
It's just the sort of guy I am.

69
00:05:09,413 --> 00:05:11,927
What do you say?
I don't know.

70
00:05:12,093 --> 00:05:15,529
It doesn't seem entirely moral to--
Fry, if you don't take this offer...

71
00:05:15,693 --> 00:05:18,002
I will lose all respect
for you and punch you.

72
00:05:19,853 --> 00:05:22,003
Well, all right.

73
00:05:22,173 --> 00:05:24,926
You sure I won't know him?
Definitely probably not.

74
00:05:25,093 --> 00:05:27,288
Just sign this contract.
Wow.

75
00:05:29,453 --> 00:05:31,364
And here we go!

76
00:05:34,053 --> 00:05:37,363
I got 100 bucks on Rectal Exam-Bot!

77
00:05:51,653 --> 00:05:55,726
Ah!
Robot Devil? I get your hands?

78
00:05:55,893 --> 00:05:58,805
Oh, what an appallingly ironic outcome!

79
00:05:58,973 --> 00:06:04,650
It's not ironic, it's just coincidental.
Now fork over those ladyfingers, cookie!

80
00:06:06,413 --> 00:06:10,292
I only put my name on there as a show
of good faith for the other robots.

81
00:06:10,493 --> 00:06:13,053
Stop being such a baby
and chop my hands off.

82
00:06:13,253 --> 00:06:15,847
Oh, very well.

83
00:06:17,093 --> 00:06:20,881
How'd you do that?
They're very good hands.

84
00:06:21,093 --> 00:06:24,768
At last! At last I have the
power to make Leela love me!

85
00:06:27,253 --> 00:06:30,643
Oh, sorry. That'll wear
off in a couple of days.

86
00:06:35,973 --> 00:06:38,009
Check it out, everyone!
I'm back from hell

87
00:06:38,173 --> 00:06:40,846
And I've got the Robot Devil's hands!
Neat!

88
00:06:41,013 --> 00:06:43,891
Let's see a trick!
Alrighty.

89
00:06:47,933 --> 00:06:51,642
Somebody called a Robot Devil's
here to see somebody called Fry.

90
00:06:51,893 --> 00:06:53,121
Uh-Oh.

91
00:06:54,613 --> 00:06:56,331
Where'd I go just now?

92
00:06:57,693 --> 00:06:59,445
Hello, Fry.

93
00:07:01,413 --> 00:07:05,167
Just dropped by to make sure you're
as happy with our little deal as I am.

94
00:07:05,333 --> 00:07:08,803
And-- Oh, give me back my hands!

95
00:07:08,973 --> 00:07:12,648
These things are always
touching me in places.

96
00:07:14,013 --> 00:07:17,210
Yeah, they get around.
But I'm afraid we had a deal.

97
00:07:17,453 --> 00:07:21,571
Looks like I wasted a bus trip.
Yes, you did.

98
00:07:54,533 --> 00:07:57,684
Yes, now you can hear
holophonor virtuoso Philip Fry...

99
00:07:57,853 --> 00:08:02,085
Playing 900 of these classic themes in
your own home on this two-Record set.

100
00:08:02,253 --> 00:08:05,404
That's over 30 minutes
of music for only $14.99.

101
00:08:05,733 --> 00:08:10,648
Only $14.99 for a two-Record set.
Two records!

102
00:08:10,853 --> 00:08:14,846
Oh, Zoidberg, at last you're
becoming a crafty consumer.

103
00:08:15,013 --> 00:08:17,322
Hello?
Hello? I'll take eight!

104
00:08:19,453 --> 00:08:22,570
A Mr. Hedonism-Bot to see you.
Show him in.

105
00:08:22,773 --> 00:08:26,971
Very good, sir.
Oh, Fry! Congratulations!

106
00:08:27,133 --> 00:08:30,330
Your latest performance was as
delectable as dipping my bottom...

107
00:08:30,493 --> 00:08:34,406
Over and over into a bath of
the silkiest oils and creams.

108
00:08:34,613 --> 00:08:36,922
Thank you. That's exactly
what I was going for.

109
00:08:37,133 --> 00:08:41,604
You are the sole diversion in what
has been a pale and unamusing season.

110
00:08:41,773 --> 00:08:45,686
And so I would fain
commission you write an opera.

111
00:08:45,893 --> 00:08:49,727
But I've never written an opera.
And I've never heard one.

112
00:08:49,893 --> 00:08:52,612
Still, if you can keep me
amused through the overture...

113
00:08:52,773 --> 00:08:55,367
I shall consider it a smashing success.

114
00:08:55,573 --> 00:08:58,645
But I wouldn't even know
what to write about. Unless...

115
00:09:03,653 --> 00:09:07,009
Okay, I'll do it.
If I can make it about Leela.

116
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:08,726
Me? Really?

117
00:09:08,973 --> 00:09:12,727
A man writing an opera about a woman?

118
00:09:13,173 --> 00:09:18,372
Oh, sirrah. How deliciously absurd.
I shall see you at the premiere.

119
00:09:41,893 --> 00:09:44,726
Is it part of the opera?
Leela! You shouldn't be listening.

120
00:09:44,933 --> 00:09:48,323
I don't want you to hear it till it's done.
But it's so beautiful.

121
00:09:48,533 --> 00:09:51,093
So is a peacock, but you
don't eat it until it's cooked.

122
00:09:51,253 --> 00:09:52,527
This has to be perfect.

123
00:09:52,693 --> 00:09:56,049
I want you to hear exactly what
I hear when I think about you.

124
00:09:56,253 --> 00:10:00,804
Oh, Fry. All this time you've had
this incredible gift and I never knew.

125
00:10:00,973 --> 00:10:04,568
I've been a fool.
A fully justified, prudent fool.

126
00:10:06,933 --> 00:10:10,972
Ah! They're so cold!
And yet hell is so hot!

127
00:10:13,333 --> 00:10:15,642
Can I have my hands?
No!

128
00:10:15,813 --> 00:10:17,531
You're not nice!

129
00:10:23,693 --> 00:10:29,131
Bender, this is a surprise.
For you, finding me in the refrigerator!

130
00:10:29,333 --> 00:10:32,131
True, but at least I don't have
the hiccups anymore. What up?

131
00:10:32,293 --> 00:10:35,683
Oh, well, it so happens I'm in
the mood to make a deal with you.

132
00:10:35,853 --> 00:10:40,847
Forget it, you can't tempt me.
Really? There's nothing you want?

133
00:10:41,013 --> 00:10:44,050
I forgot you could tempt
me with things I want.

134
00:10:44,253 --> 00:10:48,610
I suppose I've always wondered what
it would be like to be more annoying.

135
00:10:48,773 --> 00:10:51,333
Oh. Nothing simpler.

136
00:10:51,493 --> 00:10:56,806
And all I ask in return is your
hands to replace these bony hot dogs.

137
00:10:57,013 --> 00:11:00,005
Grabby and Squeezy? Never!
I love these guys!

138
00:11:00,213 --> 00:11:02,886
Is there anything else
you would part with?

139
00:11:03,093 --> 00:11:06,324
No! Nothing! Ain't gonna happen.

140
00:11:07,373 --> 00:11:11,286
Yes! With this built-In stadium air horn,
I can really annoy people!

141
00:11:11,453 --> 00:11:13,967
And all it cost me was my crotch plate.

142
00:11:14,133 --> 00:11:18,012
You certainly are a
shrewd businessman, Bender.

143
00:11:18,173 --> 00:11:20,607
Now find someone and
give them a good blast.

144
00:11:20,893 --> 00:11:24,602
Yeah! That'll teach the
first person I see a lesson.

145
00:11:24,813 --> 00:11:29,045
My ridiculously circuitous
plan is one quarter complete.

146
00:11:32,733 --> 00:11:34,849
Well, Fry's opera
premieres tomorrow night.

147
00:11:35,013 --> 00:11:38,642
I'm off to find a pair of formal gloves
that'll fit over my enormous forearms.

148
00:11:44,493 --> 00:11:47,644
Pretty annoying, huh, Leela?
What? Are you talking?

149
00:11:47,813 --> 00:11:50,532
Oh, God, I'm deaf!
Oops!

150
00:11:50,693 --> 00:11:54,003
I'm so, so sorry, Leela.
I just wanted to annoy you.

151
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:58,968
What? Oh, this is horrible!
I won't be able to hear Fry's opera.

152
00:12:01,293 --> 00:12:03,602
Oh, how delightfully ironic.

153
00:12:03,813 --> 00:12:07,362
It's not ironic. It's just mean.
Take this:

154
00:12:09,093 --> 00:12:12,847
Oh! Out of aerosol. Also ironic.

155
00:12:13,053 --> 00:12:15,931
Oh, yeah? Well, bite my shiny metal--

156
00:12:16,093 --> 00:12:19,005
Oh, no!

157
00:12:28,133 --> 00:12:29,691
Nobody tell Fry I'm deaf.

158
00:12:29,853 --> 00:12:32,970
If he found out I couldn't hear
his opera, it'd break his heart.

159
00:12:33,173 --> 00:12:34,322
Okay, Deafo.

160
00:12:35,813 --> 00:12:41,092
Courtesans and gentle fops,
I bid you welcome to my opera.

161
00:12:41,253 --> 00:12:46,486
Let us cavort like the Greeks of old.
You know the ones I mean.

162
00:12:52,813 --> 00:12:54,644
Hurrah!
Yay, Fry!

163
00:12:54,853 --> 00:12:56,605
I watch TV with that guy!

164
00:13:11,253 --> 00:13:14,165
Who is this one-Eyed...
Female baby Moses?

165
00:13:14,333 --> 00:13:17,962
With courage in...
Her female baby smile?

166
00:13:18,133 --> 00:13:20,966
A savior from the stars...
Or something stranger still?

167
00:13:21,173 --> 00:13:26,008
Or just a lonely...
Filthy, starving child?

168
00:13:26,213 --> 00:13:29,808
Amy, Fry's looking at me.
What am I supposed to be feeling?

169
00:13:31,693 --> 00:13:33,172
Ah.

170
00:13:35,853 --> 00:13:40,290
Leela, Leela, Leela, save him...

171
00:13:40,493 --> 00:13:45,408
Save Fry, save Fry...
Godzilla will devour him...

172
00:13:45,573 --> 00:13:49,532
As for me, I must be off...
To have my doctor check this cough...

173
00:13:50,853 --> 00:13:52,684
Goodbye...

174
00:13:53,773 --> 00:13:58,244
I don't recall ever fighting Godzilla.
But that is so what I would've done.

175
00:14:03,173 --> 00:14:05,084
One diet double martini, please.

176
00:14:05,253 --> 00:14:08,165
And for you, sir?
I'll just have a Shirley Hemple.

177
00:14:08,333 --> 00:14:12,884
Extra! Extra!
World's greatest opera only half over!

178
00:14:13,053 --> 00:14:14,327
Half over? Oh!

179
00:14:15,093 --> 00:14:18,972
I'd give anything to hear the rest.
Anything?

180
00:14:20,293 --> 00:14:24,047
Thank you, sir.
Now, as I was saying, anything?

181
00:14:24,213 --> 00:14:27,205
Because I can give you new robotic ears.

182
00:14:27,413 --> 00:14:29,449
What?
You can give me new ears?

183
00:14:29,613 --> 00:14:33,208
Wait. What seemingly reasonable
thing do you want in return?

184
00:14:33,413 --> 00:14:37,247
Just your hands, my dear.
Whatever you said, forget it.

185
00:14:37,453 --> 00:14:39,489
All right, then. Just one hand.

186
00:14:39,813 --> 00:14:42,611
Just my left hand?

187
00:14:43,893 --> 00:14:48,523
Please take your seats for Act 2.
I'm not done vomiting!

188
00:14:50,933 --> 00:14:52,844
I can't stand it!

189
00:14:53,053 --> 00:14:58,286
Okay! You can have my hand.
Wonderful! Just sign here.

190
00:14:58,773 --> 00:15:01,685
Calculon, old friend,
I'm afraid I need your ears.

191
00:15:01,893 --> 00:15:08,207
Well, I do owe you for giving
me this unholy acting talent!

192
00:15:14,013 --> 00:15:17,164
I can hear!
I can hear like a safecracker!

193
00:15:17,373 --> 00:15:22,891
Hey, aren't you gonna take my hand?
In good time. You go enjoy the opera.

194
00:15:27,973 --> 00:15:31,124
To win Leela 's heart...
With the holophonor's art...

195
00:15:31,333 --> 00:15:34,166
I need hands...
Of transcendental quickness...

196
00:15:34,373 --> 00:15:39,083
Well, I don 't see any danger...
ln gambling with a stranger...

197
00:15:39,373 --> 00:15:44,367
For my head is...
Of a most amazing thickness...

198
00:15:48,373 --> 00:15:51,490
I'm stupid, I'm stupid...
I'm stupider than you...

199
00:15:51,693 --> 00:15:55,322
I'm stupider than you...
ln every way...

200
00:15:55,533 --> 00:16:00,402
Stupider?
This opera's as lousy as it is brilliant!

201
00:16:06,973 --> 00:16:08,611
Your lyrics lack subtlety.

202
00:16:08,813 --> 00:16:12,123
You can't just have your
characters announce how they feel.

203
00:16:12,453 --> 00:16:15,809
That makes me feel angry!
Look, what do you want?

204
00:16:16,013 --> 00:16:19,050
I want my hands back...

205
00:16:20,853 --> 00:16:22,206
Never!

206
00:16:22,373 --> 00:16:25,410
A deal's a deal...
Even with a dirty dealer...

207
00:16:25,613 --> 00:16:30,687
Very well, then I'll take...
What I want from Leela...

208
00:16:31,093 --> 00:16:32,526
Whoa!

209
00:16:33,733 --> 00:16:36,805
Leela has promised me her hand...

210
00:16:36,973 --> 00:16:41,285
Fry, you do not understand...

211
00:16:41,453 --> 00:16:45,128
I should have revealed...
I'd been deafened by Bender...

212
00:16:45,293 --> 00:16:48,091
The shame, the shame...

213
00:16:48,253 --> 00:16:52,246
But I feared you'd stop writing...
This musical splendor...

214
00:16:52,413 --> 00:16:55,849
Deception 's the curse...
Of my whimsical gender...

215
00:16:56,093 --> 00:16:59,369
He gave me mechanical ears...

216
00:16:59,533 --> 00:17:02,730
Effective, though just a bit garish...

217
00:17:02,893 --> 00:17:08,650
In return, without shedding a tear...
I agreed that I'd give him my hand...

218
00:17:08,813 --> 00:17:10,451
In marriage...

219
00:17:10,653 --> 00:17:11,642
Huh?
What?

220
00:17:11,813 --> 00:17:15,522
You'll give me your hand in marriage...

221
00:17:15,733 --> 00:17:18,770
Is this really happening...
Or just being staged?

222
00:17:18,933 --> 00:17:22,243
It can 't be real...
Not if Leela is engaged...

223
00:17:22,453 --> 00:17:25,525
That isn 't what I meant...
That isn 't what I signed...

224
00:17:25,733 --> 00:17:29,567
You should have checked...
The wording in the fine...

225
00:17:29,733 --> 00:17:31,291
Print...

226
00:17:31,773 --> 00:17:36,051
"I'll give you my hand."
In marriage...

227
00:17:36,253 --> 00:17:40,929
"The use of words expressing something
Other than their literal intention"...

228
00:17:41,093 --> 00:17:44,722
Now that is irony...

229
00:17:46,453 --> 00:17:49,763
I will marry her now...
And confine her to hell...

230
00:17:49,933 --> 00:17:52,891
How droll, how droll...

231
00:17:53,053 --> 00:17:56,648
Where Styx is a river...
And notjust a band...

232
00:17:56,853 --> 00:18:00,323
Though they'll play our reception...
lf all goes as planned...

233
00:18:00,533 --> 00:18:05,846
Unless, Fry, you surrender...
My hands...

234
00:18:09,853 --> 00:18:15,485
Destiny has cheated me...
By forcing me to decide upon...

235
00:18:15,653 --> 00:18:20,886
The woman that I idolize...
Or the hands of an automaton...

236
00:18:21,093 --> 00:18:25,211
Without these hands I can 't complete...
The opera that was captivating her...

237
00:18:25,373 --> 00:18:28,171
But if I keep them...
And she marries him...

238
00:18:28,493 --> 00:18:32,566
Then he probably won't...
Want me dating her...

239
00:18:34,493 --> 00:18:37,007
Bravo! Encore!

240
00:18:37,213 --> 00:18:40,523
I can 't believe the devil...
Is so unforgiving...

241
00:18:40,693 --> 00:18:44,891
I can 't believe...
Everybody's just ad-Libbing...

242
00:18:46,453 --> 00:18:51,846
By the power vested in me...
By the state of New New York...

243
00:18:52,013 --> 00:18:55,323
No! Stop! Take my hands!

244
00:18:55,493 --> 00:19:01,523
You evil, metal dork...

245
00:19:06,173 --> 00:19:09,085
Surgery in an opera?
How wonderfully decadent!

246
00:19:09,253 --> 00:19:11,926
And just as I was
beginning to lose interest.

247
00:19:12,093 --> 00:19:15,290
Jombee, the chocolate icing.

248
00:19:15,653 --> 00:19:19,441
Oh. Oh, my, yes.

249
00:19:20,813 --> 00:19:25,011
My hands!
My horrible human hands!

250
00:19:25,813 --> 00:19:29,123
And what did you do to my nails?
I cleaned them.

251
00:19:29,333 --> 00:19:33,212
Now, if you'll excuse me,
it's my poker night and I feel lucky.

252
00:19:33,613 --> 00:19:37,049
So it's back to hell for me.
Come on, Nixon!

253
00:19:41,333 --> 00:19:45,929
Less reality, more fantasy!
Resume the opera!

254
00:19:46,133 --> 00:19:47,851
But I can't play anymore!

255
00:19:48,053 --> 00:19:53,127
Yes, you can! The beauty was
in your heart, not your hands!

256
00:20:04,053 --> 00:20:07,568
The music's bad and you should feel bad!

257
00:20:08,813 --> 00:20:12,283
Ah! Oh! Whoa! Hey! Whoa.

258
00:20:14,053 --> 00:20:17,728
Extra! Extra!
Greatest opera of all time sucks!

259
00:20:17,893 --> 00:20:19,884
I'll take eight.

260
00:20:29,253 --> 00:20:31,972
Please don't stop playing, Fry.

261
00:20:32,613 --> 00:20:35,127
I wanna hear how it ends.
