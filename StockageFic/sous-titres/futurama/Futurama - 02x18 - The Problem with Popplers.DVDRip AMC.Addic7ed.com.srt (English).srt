1
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:06,395
Futurama <i>is brought to you</i>
<i>by Molten Boron.</i>

2
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:09,398
<i>Nobody doesn 't like Molten Boron!</i>

3
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:16,836
The Problem with Popplers

4
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:44,833
I hate the Moochers.
They offer you a drink...

5
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:47,674
...but their wallet's always
in the other pants...

6
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,956
...which they borrowed from me!

7
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:51,195
Dinner ready?

8
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:53,789
The Moochers cleaned out our pantry.

9
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:57,953
All they left was baking soda
and capers. And here it is!

10
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:02,557
Great. We're two days from Earth
with no food.

11
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:07,515
Fight to the death. I'll cook the
loser. Work his gut. I like it tender.

12
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:12,635
Maybe that planet has a drive-thru!
Burger Jerk, Fishy Joe's or Chiseler.

13
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:15,593
No, we're a billion miles
from nowhere.

14
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,479
It probably only has
a Howard Johnson's.

15
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:27,279
A type-M planet, so it should at least
have Rodden berries.

16
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:31,029
I'm good at foraging.
I found mushrooms on my bathmat.

17
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:34,198
I found some rocks!
You eat rocks, right?

18
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,868
Not even sautéed in a little mud?

19
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:39,594
Look! A ditch full of fried shrimp!

20
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:44,231
Are you blind? Looks more
like a hole full of fried prawns.

21
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:52,349
This thing on my wrist says
they're not poisonous.

22
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:55,757
Well, how are they?

23
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:06,075
They're great! They're like sex!
Except I'm having them!

24
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:08,396
These would go great with rocks!

25
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:09,868
Look! Here's more!

26
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,992
- The planet's full of them!
- I'll take a few.

27
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:17,273
- No! A whole Bender-ful!
- Only what we need. Stuff the ship!

28
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,432
Planet Express ship,
you are cleared to land.

29
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:27,959
<i>Roger!</i>

30
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,954
Oh, man! I'm inhaling these things!

31
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:38,152
You guys scored some primo stuff here!

32
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:42,559
They're tastier than a penguin nest.
What do you call them?

33
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:46,833
- No name yet.
- They're tasty. What about Tasty-cles?

34
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:50,078
- Not that.
- Why not?

35
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:53,915
It sounds like frozen
mountain oysters on a stick.

36
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:56,156
You know, Test-cicles.

37
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,949
The only names not yet trademarked
are...

38
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,991
...Popplers and Zittzers.

39
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:04,873
- We'll call them "Popplers"!
- Yeah. Why not?

40
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,513
- You picked it.
- Swish!

41
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:11,355
Call them what you want.
I call them a free meal.

42
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:13,676
Slow down there, Sigmund!

43
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,753
I can't stand poor people
getting free food.

44
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,956
We gotta sell these things!

45
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,191
- Good idea!
- Bender's a genius!

46
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:30,554
- Business is great.
- Great's okay. Amazing would be great!

47
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,078
Don't push!
There's hot dogs for everyone!

48
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:40,753
Where do you want those rat droppings
you ordered?

49
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:47,556
You're not the guy who delivers
the rat droppings!

50
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,150
Popplers? Never heard of them!

51
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,753
Eat it or beat it!

52
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,355
These are great!

53
00:03:56,600 --> 00:04:00,957
Boys, this is your lucky day!
I'm Joe Gillman.

54
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:05,558
- You're a guy who eats at Fishy Joe's?
- Hell, no! I am Fishy Joe!

55
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:09,349
I've got a fast-food franchise
on every planet.

56
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,874
Except McPluto.

57
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:14,595
I wanted to write you about
the in-store kiddie parks.

58
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:19,755
- The slides won't support a robot.
- Not interested. But these are great!

59
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,752
- How much?
- $ 1 a dozen.

60
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,992
You'll never make money.
Supply them to me...

61
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:29,950
...and I'll sell them for $2 a dozen.
I'll even pay you $ 1 a dozen.

62
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:33,357
I'll be rich! You too,
but that doesn't excite me.

63
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:34,549
How do we sign?

64
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:40,392
<i>Pop a Poppler at Fishy</i> J<i>oe's</i>

65
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,795

W<i>here they're from no one knows</i>

66
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:46,350
<i>Pick them, lick them, chew them,</i>
<i>Stick them, if you won 't sue</i>

67
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,079
<i>Shove one up your nose</i>

68
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,156
I can't pay.

69
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:14,352
That's the second billboard this week!

70
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:18,479
Sorry. I was distracted
by those protesters outside.

71
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:32,798
Unless this is a nude love-in,
get the hell off my property!

72
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:36,080
You can't own property, man!

73
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:38,999
I can, because I'm not
a penniless hippie!

74
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,719
What do you want?

75
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:44,151
We're with Mankind
for Ethical Animal Treatment!

76
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:48,673
Popplers are living creatures.
Stop harvesting them for food!

77
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:52,316
- Or what?
- Or we'll boycott Fishy Joe's!

78
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:54,988
You're vegetarians. Who cares?

79
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,349
Shut up!

80
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,915
Animals eat animals. It's nature.

81
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:02,749
No, it isn't.
We taught a lion to eat tofu.

82
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:09,272
The point is, you shouldn't eat things
that feel pain...

83
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:13,155
- Okay, we won't eat you!
- I'll go get some more bricks.

84
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:16,953
I wish you'd throw out
these old Popplers.

85
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:20,476
They're getting big and scaly.
There's one left.

86
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,354
Mama!

87
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,476
Stop! Stop eating Popplers!

88
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,398
- Why?
- My booze!

89
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,956
Popplers are intelligent!
This one called me mama!

90
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:46,755
Congratulations!
I assume Amy is the father?

91
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,439
Popplers can't talk.

92
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:52,679
She's hallucinating from lack
of Popplers. Eat some now!

93
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:55,917
- No!
- I said eat! Come on, <i>mangia</i>!

94
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:00,353
- Sorry, babies.
- Maybe you should lie down.

95
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,357
Yes, listen to the father.

96
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:06,951
I'm telling you it spoke to me.
Come on, little Poppler. Say mama?

97
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:11,150
Hearing one talk
doesn't mean it's intelligent.

98
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:16,354
- Parrots talk and we eat them, right?
- Maybe it learned as a parlor trick.

99
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,551
- Like Fry.
- Like Fry! Like Fry!

100
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:23,754
There's one way, and only one way, to
determine if an animal is intelligent.

101
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:25,632
Dissect its brain.

102
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,718
No! Mama! Stop Grandpa!

103
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,799
Enough chitchat!
Restrain the specimen!

104
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,958
- Good.
- Give me some of that special sauce.

105
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:47,153
Stop eating Popplers! They can talk!

106
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,755
Don't stop to talk! Eat Popplers!

107
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,754
- Cut it out!
- Take a coupon! Cut it out!

108
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:04,718
I won't let you enter! Popplers
are as intelligent as you or me!

109
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:05,909
You, maybe.

110
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,911
Hear me, hear me!

111
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,951
Stop eating Popplers!

112
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:19,955
Stop eating them with honey mustard
sauce, tangy sweet and sour sauce!

113
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:23,237
Stop eating the fiesta Popplers salad!

114
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:26,318
Stop taking advantage
of the cheaper 12-pack!

115
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:34,192
Stop enjoying Popplers on the patio,
in the car or on the boat.

116
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:36,954
Wherever good times are had...

164
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:49,757
If we could undo the damage...

165
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,309
It'd be great with quack-a-mole.

166
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:56,080
Stop eating our young!
And it's guacamole!

167
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:00,157
All right. I'm putting them away.

168
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,438
What is it you want?

169
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:05,959
We demand...

170
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:09,709
...to eat one human for each
Omicronian that was eaten!

171
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:12,354
Fair enough. How many is that?

172
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,955
It's 198 billion, sir.

173
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:19,756
Very well. You will provide us
with 198 billion humans.

174
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,150
- And small fries.
- Lure!

175
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,470
All right. Cottage cheese.

176
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:27,553
Sir?
There aren't that many human beings.

177
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:30,553
A thought:
There aren't that many humans.

178
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:33,832
We'll wait while you
shore up the numbers.

179
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:36,600
Well, 198 billion babies
in a few weeks.

180
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:40,276
We'll need super-virile men
scoring 'round the clock.

181
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:43,956
I'll do my part.
Kif? Clear my schedule.

182
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:50,279
Just wipe out humanity.
Get it over with.

183
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:53,757
- It's the waiting I can't stand.
- That's stupid.

184
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:02,672
Fellow earthlings,
we've reached an agreement.

185
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:05,394
Using the twin guns
of grace and tact...

186
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:10,156
...I blasted our worthless enemies
with a fair compromise.

187
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:15,031
- They won't eat everyone.
- I filled up on nuts negotiating.

188
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:18,789
Instead, they'll eat only
one human of their choice.

189
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,470
We'll eat the first earthling
who ate our offspring.

190
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:26,952
Here is the culprit, as photographed
by our nanny-cam satellite.

191
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:32,270
She must be sacrificed,
but the rest of you shall be spared!

192
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:37,791
Boo! Boo!

193
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:52,154
Tonight, the world watches
in horror...

194
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:55,591
...as an earthling is eaten alive
on network TV.

195
00:13:55,840 --> 00:14:00,630
This scene of unimaginable carnage
is brought to you by Fishy Joe's!

196
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:03,155
Try our new Extreme Walrus Juice!

197
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:07,953
<i>One hundred percent fresh-s</i>q<i>ueezed</i>
<i>walrus! Ride the walrus!</i>

198
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,754
<i>Ladies and gentlemen!</i>

199
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:14,919
<i>The Omicronians!</i>

200
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:19,551
Greetings, Earth morsels!

201
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:22,316
- You suck!
- Get a job!

202
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,558
I'll miss you, Leela.

203
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:27,399
You're just a carbon-based
life form...

204
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:31,832
...but I'll always think of you
as a big pile of titanium.

205
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:36,796
Bender means you're really brave,
smart, beautiful and a great friend.

206
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,554
Just like titanium.

207
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:45,554
What a load! I was the one trying
to save the Popplers!

208
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:48,480
You ate them like the fat hog you are!

209
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:51,757
And you were stepping on them
for fun!

210
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:56,638
- You should be in here!
- Someone's acting awfully aluminum.

211
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:00,475
My sweet, I've come to save you.
I have a devious plan.

212
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:03,877
Great. Captain Moron has a plan.

213
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:06,071
Tell it to Wingus and Dingus.

214
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:10,632
Wingus? Dingus? We're going to give
the aliens the old switcheroo.

215
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:15,756
I found a giant, hideous ape
that looks exactly like Leela.

216
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:21,709
It doesn't look anything like me!
The hair's all wrong.

217
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:26,272
Don't worry. Kif is an expert stylist
as you can plainly see.

218
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:40,352
This might actually work. Omicronians
have trouble telling people apart.

219
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:43,552
True. They thought Kif
was the statesman...

220
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:46,792
...and I, a jabbering mental patient.
Right, Kif?

221
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,560
Please, I'm creating!

222
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:53,389
<i>Voilà</i>!

223
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,750
- That's Leela!
- I'm seeing double!

224
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:04,593
I grow hungry!
Bring on the one called Leela.

225
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:07,400
- That comes with salad or soup.
- Salad.

226
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,875
- Ranch or vinaigrette?
- Vinaigrette.

227
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:12,350
Balsamic or raspberry?

228
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:21,516
What's going on here?

229
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:24,032
It's very strange.

230
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,151
People of Earth...

231
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,792
- I get it.
- I understand.

232
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,510
Yes, this is the one. Definitely.

233
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:41,076
I recognize her slumping posture
and hairy knuckles.

234
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:54,356
Would you like some human
with your salt?

235
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:01,796
This is it. If the aliens fall for
Zapp's ploy, the Earth will be saved.

236
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,072
Brought to you by Fishy Joe's.
Ride the walrus.

237
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:13,870
Wait! Stop! It's a trick!
That's not Leela!

238
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:16,791
What? I'm losing the crowd!

239
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:22,353
It's an orangutan, one of Mother
Earth's most precious creatures.

240
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:30,791
Why'd you open your bong hole,
you smelly hippie?

241
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,515
You'd sacrifice a beautiful woman
for an attractive monkey?

242
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,234
You must have smoked some bad granola.

243
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:42,355
The one called Smelly Hippie is right!
This is a monkey!

244
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:45,195
Yes. Definitely.

245
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,112
Where is the real female?

246
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:49,788
- I'll never tell.
- Where is she?

247
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:52,156
I'll get her for you.

248
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:56,952
This may hurt our chances of
consummating our relationship again.

249
00:17:57,160 --> 00:18:00,948
- Go consummate yourself.
- Stop talking! You're getting cold!

250
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:04,115
Please! I just paid off my car!

251
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,754
- No!
- I can't look!

252
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:21,798
People of Earth, I am Jurr of the
planet Omicron Persei Eight.

253
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:24,349
Could you lower this thing for me?

254
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:28,235
Now then, if Leela gets eaten,
I get eaten.

255
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:33,679
Little one, get out of there!
I'm going to count to Blorks!

256
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:36,150
But elder one...

257
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:43,555
Hear me out! There are many
good reasons to eat!

258
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:48,072
Hunger, boredom, wanting to be
the world's fattest man!

259
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:51,317
But not revenge.
Are we no better than they?

260
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:53,590
Besides, Leela's my friend.

261
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:57,071
- She's your friend?
- Yeah, I am!

262
00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:01,233
Leela's garbled words have opened
my eyes!

263
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:08,997
Okay, that's a start.
It's very earth-friendly.

264
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:12,550
Now everyone join hands.
Join hands, please.

265
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:16,958
I'd like to lead you all in some
swaying. Pay attention.

266
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:18,912
I said do it!

267
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:22,159
- Is he your friend too?
- No.

268
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,356
This is not happening.

269
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:32,150
I think there was something funny
in that hippie.

270
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:36,638
Thank you, Jurr. I hope you'll always
think of me as your mom.

271
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:40,355
When my species grows up,
we eat our moms.

272
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,993
People of Earth...
That hippie's starting to kick in.

273
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:50,394
We've all learned an important lesson
today. I realize now that...

274
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:54,076
Dude, my hands are huge!

275
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:59,750
They can touch anything
but themselves.

276
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:02,349
- Oh, wait...
- Let's go.

277
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,151
Whoa, I feel like I'm flying.

278
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:30,357
A toast to Leela. She showed us
it's wrong to eat certain things.

279
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:32,198
- Here!
- Let's get drunk!

280
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:35,915
- Thanks, guys. Pass the veal, please?
- Here you go.

281
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:38,953
Let me get some of that suckling pig.

282
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:41,158
Who wants dolphin?

283
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,715
But dolphins are intelligent.

284
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:47,196
No, this one blew his money
on lottery tickets.

285
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,318
- Good.
- Pass the blowhole.

286
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:52,478
- Fluke, please.
- <i>Q</i>uit hogging the bottle-nose!

287
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:55,951
Toss me the speech center
of the brain!
