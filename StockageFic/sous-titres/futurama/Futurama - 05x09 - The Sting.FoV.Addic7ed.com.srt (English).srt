1
00:00:07,493 --> 00:00:09,563
Futurama [5x09] - The Sting - CiWaN

2
00:00:36,733 --> 00:00:38,689
A hush comes over the crowd.

3
00:00:38,853 --> 00:00:43,847
The only sound is Bender calling
everyone else a jerk as he swings!

4
00:00:45,493 --> 00:00:48,690
And he slices into the water!
Man!

5
00:00:51,533 --> 00:00:53,763
Boy, I tell you, buddy.

6
00:00:55,613 --> 00:00:59,765
Bad news, everyone! You're not good
enough to go on your next mission.

7
00:00:59,973 --> 00:01:01,691
Hooray!
Not good enough!

8
00:01:01,853 --> 00:01:05,243
Why? Says who?
Because. And says me.

9
00:01:05,413 --> 00:01:09,167
It's an extremely dangerous
mission that killed my last crew.

10
00:01:09,373 --> 00:01:11,603
And you're not nearly as good as them.
Woo-Hoo!

11
00:01:11,773 --> 00:01:13,684
We live to suck another day!

12
00:01:16,693 --> 00:01:17,887
Oh...

13
00:01:18,373 --> 00:01:21,809
We're just as good as any of those
other crews you sent to their deaths.

14
00:01:22,013 --> 00:01:25,449
What's the mission?
Collecting honey, ordinary honey.

15
00:01:25,653 --> 00:01:29,009
That doesn't sound so dangerous.
This is no ordinary honey!

16
00:01:29,213 --> 00:01:31,408
It's produced by vicious space bees.

17
00:01:31,573 --> 00:01:35,851
A single sting of their hideous
neurotoxin can cause instant death!

18
00:01:36,053 --> 00:01:40,490
That's if you're not allergic. You don't
wanna know what happens then, no, no.

19
00:01:40,653 --> 00:01:45,044
Your insides will boil out of your eye
sockets like a science fair volcano!

20
00:01:45,253 --> 00:01:48,051
I didn't want to know!

21
00:01:48,253 --> 00:01:52,212
These bees are larger than
most Buicks and twice as ugly.

22
00:01:52,413 --> 00:01:56,088
Larger than an American sedan?
How big is the honeycomb?

23
00:01:56,293 --> 00:01:58,568
Honeycomb's big.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

24
00:01:58,773 --> 00:02:01,003
It's not small?
No, no, no.

25
00:02:01,213 --> 00:02:05,001
It'll take more than deadly, deadly bees
to keep us from doing our job.

26
00:02:05,173 --> 00:02:07,562
Come on, boys.
But, Leela, we're no good.

27
00:02:07,773 --> 00:02:11,891
Listen, I'm scared too. But I'm
more scared of disappointing myself.

28
00:02:12,093 --> 00:02:13,845
I'm not scared of that at all.

29
00:02:35,533 --> 00:02:37,763
Now, bees communicate by dancing.

30
00:02:37,973 --> 00:02:40,533
Like my parents!
Oh, wait, that was hitting.

31
00:02:40,733 --> 00:02:43,293
So this language cartridge
will let you distract them.

32
00:02:43,453 --> 00:02:46,968
Ah, good. I often have thoughts that
can only be expressed through dance.

33
00:03:00,933 --> 00:03:02,446
Bender, quick!
Waggle something!

34
00:03:14,973 --> 00:03:18,170
Leela, let's turn back. There's absolutely
no shame in wussing out.

35
00:03:18,373 --> 00:03:20,204
Relax, everything'll be fine.

36
00:03:22,533 --> 00:03:25,366
Oh, my God!
The old Planet Express ship!

37
00:03:25,533 --> 00:03:27,364
There's the black box.

38
00:03:28,533 --> 00:03:31,889
Captain! The bees have us surrounded!
Oh, the professor was right!

39
00:03:32,053 --> 00:03:35,284
We're not as good as his old crew!
Well, I aim to prove him wrong.

40
00:03:35,493 --> 00:03:39,042
It'll take more than a few deadly,
deadly bees to-- Oh, Lord!

41
00:03:41,693 --> 00:03:44,844
I couldn't make that out.
Too much static.

42
00:03:54,933 --> 00:03:56,446
Eww.

43
00:04:01,533 --> 00:04:04,286
We found it!
The honeycomb hideout!

44
00:04:09,373 --> 00:04:12,683
Hey, what's this goop?
Royal jelly. They feed it to the queen.

45
00:04:12,893 --> 00:04:15,123
Bees make honey and jelly?

46
00:04:15,773 --> 00:04:17,684
How come nothing
humans make tastes good?

47
00:04:21,613 --> 00:04:25,447
Help! I can't swim in jelly,
as far as I know!

48
00:04:27,133 --> 00:04:30,648
Look!
It's a baby queen!

49
00:04:31,613 --> 00:04:37,370
She's so cute! You adorable,
wittle, itty-Bitty, fuzzy, wuzzy--

50
00:04:37,573 --> 00:04:41,043
Leela, stop bonding and let's go!
I got jelly in my underpants!

51
00:04:41,253 --> 00:04:42,606
I'm taking this bee with us.

52
00:04:42,773 --> 00:04:46,163
With a queen, we can build a hive
and make more honey ourselves.

53
00:04:46,373 --> 00:04:48,568
Let me just pack her
a lunch and we'll go.

54
00:04:48,733 --> 00:04:50,052
Pick up the pace, lady!

55
00:04:50,213 --> 00:04:52,773
I'm sick of shaking my
booty for these fat jerks.

56
00:04:54,893 --> 00:04:58,772
I didn't mean you're all fat.
Just Fatso there.

57
00:05:10,573 --> 00:05:11,847
Help!

58
00:05:14,173 --> 00:05:17,051
This is where we distinguish
ourselves from the last crew.

59
00:05:17,213 --> 00:05:20,046
Activate emergency high-Speed,
self-Contained escape pack...

60
00:05:20,213 --> 00:05:23,285
Crisis response units.
Quick!

61
00:05:33,893 --> 00:05:35,724
Ow! Ow! Ow!

62
00:05:42,253 --> 00:05:44,050
Ah! Ooh! Ah!

63
00:05:47,373 --> 00:05:48,965
Good luck, Bender!

64
00:06:03,453 --> 00:06:05,011
I'm back, baby!

65
00:06:13,813 --> 00:06:16,486
We made it! We're alive!
Burn on that old crew!

66
00:06:16,693 --> 00:06:19,366
The only things they did better
than us were suck and die.

67
00:06:19,573 --> 00:06:22,406
Leela, we got lucky this time,
but you should be more careful.

68
00:06:22,573 --> 00:06:26,248
I don't want anything to happen to you.
Thanks, but I can look out for myself.

69
00:06:26,413 --> 00:06:29,723
Frankly, I can smell danger a mile away.
Look out!

70
00:06:32,813 --> 00:06:35,407
You want her?
You're gonna have to go through me!

71
00:06:47,813 --> 00:06:50,725
You call that a wound?
That's a boo-Boo, tops.

72
00:06:50,893 --> 00:06:54,363
But thanks for trying
to save me, Fry. Fry?

73
00:06:56,533 --> 00:06:57,966
He's...

74
00:06:58,133 --> 00:06:59,851
He's dead.

75
00:07:00,653 --> 00:07:06,888
Oh, who will make Bender waffles
just the way he likes them now?

76
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:31,128
It was all my fault!
He died because of me!

77
00:07:31,293 --> 00:07:34,888
No, no, no, no, no, no.

78
00:07:35,053 --> 00:07:37,442
I'm lying to make her feel better.

79
00:07:41,853 --> 00:07:44,651
Husband, can't you go anywhere
without lighting something up?

80
00:07:44,813 --> 00:07:48,522
It's an old Jamaican accounting tradition.
We burn his timecard.

81
00:07:48,693 --> 00:07:52,447
That way his zombie doesn't come
back looking for his final paycheck.

82
00:07:52,613 --> 00:07:54,285
He looks so natural.

83
00:07:54,453 --> 00:07:57,570
It's funny to think he's crammed
full of sawdust and preservatives.

84
00:07:57,733 --> 00:08:00,247
I only wish I could've
removed the stinger.

85
00:08:03,653 --> 00:08:05,883
I barely knew Philip.
But as a clergyman...

86
00:08:06,053 --> 00:08:09,443
I have no problem telling his most
intimate friends all about him.

87
00:08:10,973 --> 00:08:12,929
Soothe us with sweet lies.

88
00:08:13,133 --> 00:08:16,967
It may comfort you to know
Fry's death took only 15 seconds.

89
00:08:17,133 --> 00:08:21,763
Yet the pain was so intense that
it felt to him like 15 years.

90
00:08:22,293 --> 00:08:26,127
And it goes without saying,
it caused him to empty his bowels.

91
00:08:28,133 --> 00:08:32,604
We now commend Fry's body to the ages.

92
00:08:40,613 --> 00:08:42,763
He's walking on sunshine now.

93
00:08:42,973 --> 00:08:47,171
This makes me the oldest
member of my family.

94
00:08:49,973 --> 00:08:52,362
Him do good snu-Snu.

95
00:08:52,613 --> 00:08:54,968
Eh...

96
00:08:55,293 --> 00:09:01,084
All those times I said, "Kill all humans",
I'd always whisper, "except one".

97
00:09:01,253 --> 00:09:05,804
Fry was that one,
and I never told him so!

98
00:09:08,013 --> 00:09:11,483
Farewell from the world of tomorrow!

99
00:09:24,253 --> 00:09:28,292
They say a spoonful of space
honey helps ease the pain.

100
00:09:38,653 --> 00:09:40,291
Mm.

101
00:09:40,493 --> 00:09:42,051
It's good.

102
00:09:43,013 --> 00:09:45,925
I feel funny.
Ha-Ha funny.

103
00:09:49,333 --> 00:09:50,561
Huh?

104
00:10:01,853 --> 00:10:04,731
Leela?
Fry? I thought you were dead.

105
00:10:04,893 --> 00:10:08,966
Nope, I'm better than ever.
Before the accident, I couldn't do this:

106
00:10:09,173 --> 00:10:13,007
Impressive! But it does sort of
support my you-Are-Dead theory.

107
00:10:13,213 --> 00:10:16,489
Then I'll prove I'm alive by telling
you something only I could know.

108
00:10:16,773 --> 00:10:18,764
There's a surprise for you in my locker.

109
00:10:18,933 --> 00:10:22,050
I got it at a Swedish
novelty shop before we left.

110
00:10:25,533 --> 00:10:28,331
It's too beautiful to open.
Can I open it?

111
00:10:28,533 --> 00:10:30,728
Sure. There's just one
thing I want you to do.

112
00:10:30,933 --> 00:10:32,924
What?
I want you to wake up.

113
00:10:33,093 --> 00:10:34,412
Wake up?
But I'm not--

114
00:10:37,893 --> 00:10:41,203
In my dream, Fry said he hid
a gift for me in his locker.

115
00:10:41,413 --> 00:10:44,325
If it's true, then he must
still exist in some form.

116
00:10:44,533 --> 00:10:49,402
Of course he still exists.
As a frozen corpse in outer space.

117
00:10:50,293 --> 00:10:52,887
Oh, I made myself sad.

118
00:10:53,093 --> 00:10:54,606
Well, here goes.

119
00:11:01,093 --> 00:11:02,811
Oh .
Bupkis.

120
00:11:05,573 --> 00:11:06,972
Well, I feel better now.

121
00:11:07,133 --> 00:11:10,205
Pawning all the stuff in Fry's
locker helped give me closure.

122
00:11:10,413 --> 00:11:14,645
Was there a gift for me?
No, nothing. Not at all.

123
00:11:14,813 --> 00:11:17,566
No way, José.
Here it is.

124
00:11:19,533 --> 00:11:21,808
You took this from Fry's locker?
The guy's dead.

125
00:11:21,973 --> 00:11:23,611
There's no law against grave robbing.

126
00:11:28,253 --> 00:11:32,724
That proves it! Fry is alive somewhere
and he's reaching me in my dreams!

127
00:11:32,893 --> 00:11:34,167
Bull pies!

128
00:11:35,773 --> 00:11:38,241
Lay down here and we'll do some tests.

129
00:11:38,453 --> 00:11:39,932
If Fry is out there somewhere...

130
00:11:40,093 --> 00:11:43,722
Leela's brain could be acting
as a five-Pound Ouija board.

131
00:11:44,493 --> 00:11:47,405
Is this some sort of brain scanner?
Some sort, yes.

132
00:11:47,573 --> 00:11:50,212
In France, it's called a "guillotine".

133
00:11:51,453 --> 00:11:54,445
Professor! Can't you examine
my brain without removing it?

134
00:11:54,613 --> 00:11:56,888
Yes, easily.

135
00:11:57,853 --> 00:12:00,606
Hey, what if Fry wasn't
actually dead when we buried him?

136
00:12:00,773 --> 00:12:04,129
You know, like Julia Roberts.
Well, I suppose there's a slim--

137
00:12:06,013 --> 00:12:07,685
I don't believe it!

138
00:12:07,893 --> 00:12:10,726
What is it? Is Fry alive in some
other dimension or something?

139
00:12:10,933 --> 00:12:15,961
No! According to this Gizmometer,
Fry is dead and nothing can bring him back.

140
00:12:16,133 --> 00:12:19,170
Remarkable!
But, my dream!

141
00:12:19,333 --> 00:12:22,245
Your science can't un-Prove that.
How could I have known...

142
00:12:22,413 --> 00:12:24,722
The gift was in Fry's locker?
Easy.

143
00:12:24,893 --> 00:12:29,125
He told you about it before he died and
your grief-Roasted mind blocked it out.

144
00:12:29,293 --> 00:12:31,807
Are you saying I'm going crazy?

145
00:12:32,013 --> 00:12:36,848
No, no. No one's saying that.
But I'm certainly thinking it loudly.

146
00:12:47,653 --> 00:12:50,645
Hi, Leela. I'm just gonna keep
talking even if you can't hear me.

147
00:12:50,813 --> 00:12:54,203
Blah, blah, blah. Blah, blah, blah--
Shut up! I can hear you!

148
00:12:54,373 --> 00:12:56,682
The professor says you're just a dream.

149
00:12:56,853 --> 00:13:01,290
Oh, yeah? Could a dream take
you dancing in a Vanusian garden?

150
00:13:01,493 --> 00:13:05,327
Well, yes, technically.
But it's still very sweet of you.

151
00:13:05,493 --> 00:13:09,532
Then what if we shared a midnight sleigh
ride across the ice fields of Hyperion?

152
00:13:18,373 --> 00:13:20,329
Oh, Fry, you must be alive.

153
00:13:20,533 --> 00:13:24,048
I've never been treated so romantically
by my own imagination before.

154
00:13:24,253 --> 00:13:27,689
Here, take my jacket.
You look a little cold.

155
00:13:27,853 --> 00:13:30,083
Thank you.
It's all so beautiful.

156
00:13:30,253 --> 00:13:33,529
I forgot how many hundreds of
degrees below zero it must be.

157
00:13:33,693 --> 00:13:36,207
I just wish I could convince
the others you're alive.

158
00:13:36,413 --> 00:13:38,449
You can!
All you have to do is wake up.

159
00:13:38,653 --> 00:13:41,326
No, no! Don't say that!
This is real!

160
00:13:42,893 --> 00:13:44,531
Not another dream!

161
00:13:46,533 --> 00:13:49,206
Fry's jacket!
The one he was buried in!

162
00:13:49,373 --> 00:13:52,604
My dream was real!
He's alive!

163
00:13:53,933 --> 00:13:56,606
Quit your bragging!
My boyfriend's alive too.

164
00:13:56,773 --> 00:13:59,048
Oh, not anymore.

165
00:14:07,853 --> 00:14:09,571
That's better.

166
00:14:12,773 --> 00:14:14,764
Fry's alive! I have proof!

167
00:14:14,973 --> 00:14:16,406
What?
You do not!

168
00:14:16,573 --> 00:14:18,529
I'm from Jamaica, the "Show Me" island.

169
00:14:18,693 --> 00:14:20,649
So show me you blowing
it out your fanny.

170
00:14:20,853 --> 00:14:23,765
But he gave me his jacket.
Look!

171
00:14:24,333 --> 00:14:27,370
That's not Fry's jacket.
Fry's jacket is red.

172
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:30,889
That's your jacket.
An off-The-Rack lime-Green affair.

173
00:14:31,093 --> 00:14:35,245
But Fry-- His jacket--
And when I woke up it was on me!

174
00:14:35,453 --> 00:14:38,604
You're under a lot of guilt stress, Leela.
Here, work it out.

175
00:14:38,773 --> 00:14:41,890
I am not under stress, damn it!

176
00:14:42,093 --> 00:14:44,368
Everything's going to
be all right, Leela.

177
00:14:44,573 --> 00:14:45,562
What?

178
00:14:45,733 --> 00:14:47,564
Everything's going to be all right.

179
00:14:48,453 --> 00:14:50,364
Maybe I am freaking out a little.

180
00:14:50,573 --> 00:14:54,202
A little? You're screwier than
my Aunt Rita, and she's a screw!

181
00:14:54,413 --> 00:14:57,530
I need to calm down. I better
take some more of that space honey.

182
00:14:57,693 --> 00:15:02,130
You've been taking space honey?
Be careful, you purple-Haired imbecile!

183
00:15:02,293 --> 00:15:06,206
One spoonful calms you down.
Two spoonfuls help you sleep.

184
00:15:06,373 --> 00:15:09,490
But three spoonfuls, and you'll
go into a sleep so deep...

185
00:15:09,653 --> 00:15:11,723
You'll never wake up.
Never!

186
00:15:11,933 --> 00:15:14,049
Never!
Never!

187
00:15:17,213 --> 00:15:19,602
One spoonful to calm me down.

188
00:15:23,853 --> 00:15:27,004
Okay, I got a pretty good calm going.

189
00:15:27,173 --> 00:15:29,687
Two spoonfuls to help me sleep.

190
00:15:31,773 --> 00:15:36,688
Uh-Oh. Still awake.
I guess one more spoonful couldn't hurt.

191
00:15:37,933 --> 00:15:39,889
Oh, my gosh!
I better get a sponge!

192
00:15:44,133 --> 00:15:47,045
Fry? Is that you?
I don't need a sponge!

193
00:15:49,213 --> 00:15:52,410
Why am I sticky and naked?
Did I miss something fun?

194
00:15:54,533 --> 00:15:59,049
Incredible! According to the Gizmometer,
Fry touched the royal jelly...

195
00:15:59,213 --> 00:16:03,365
In the space hive, leaving an
imprint of his DNA and brain waves.

196
00:16:03,533 --> 00:16:05,444
Then, when it spilled on the couch...

197
00:16:05,613 --> 00:16:08,810
It recombined with trace
amounts of Fry's hair and skin--

198
00:16:08,973 --> 00:16:11,407
And blood!
Don't forget about Fry's blood.

199
00:16:11,613 --> 00:16:12,966
Yes, Bender, thank you.

200
00:16:13,133 --> 00:16:15,931
In short, the various fluids
Fry left in the couch...

201
00:16:16,093 --> 00:16:19,529
Caused the royal jelly to
regenerate his entire being!

202
00:16:19,733 --> 00:16:21,291
Neat.
This is great!

203
00:16:21,453 --> 00:16:24,331
My buddy's alive and his
credit cards are valid again.

204
00:16:24,493 --> 00:16:26,165
Let's go get hammered!

205
00:16:27,493 --> 00:16:30,087
I should warn you, I'm a mean drunk.

206
00:16:30,893 --> 00:16:34,010
Fry, I'm so glad I didn't kill you.
Me too.

207
00:16:34,213 --> 00:16:37,011
Feeling responsible for your
death was driving me mad.

208
00:16:37,173 --> 00:16:40,324
But now everything is all right.
Not everything.

209
00:16:40,533 --> 00:16:43,491
What? What do you mean?
You have to wake up.

210
00:16:43,693 --> 00:16:47,402
Wake up? Oh, no. No!
It can't be!

211
00:16:49,773 --> 00:16:51,092
Poo!

212
00:16:51,293 --> 00:16:54,968
I'm cracking up. In my dreams
I'm happy because Fry is alive.

213
00:16:55,133 --> 00:16:57,408
But when I'm awake my
mind plays tricks on me.

214
00:16:57,613 --> 00:17:01,845
Take it easy, Leela.
In every life we have some trouble.

215
00:17:02,013 --> 00:17:04,481
But when you worry, you make it double.

216
00:17:46,493 --> 00:17:50,202
Uh, were you just singing?
No, I was telling you not to worry.

217
00:17:50,373 --> 00:17:52,762
I'm not allowed to sing.
Court order.

218
00:17:57,533 --> 00:17:59,489
I'll find Fry's coffin,
get his corpse...

219
00:17:59,653 --> 00:18:02,372
And keep it under my mattress
to remind me he's dead.

220
00:18:02,533 --> 00:18:03,966
That'll prove I'm not insane.

221
00:18:15,813 --> 00:18:18,281
Okay, it's just an ordinary coffin...

222
00:18:18,453 --> 00:18:21,525
Containing my ordinary
dead friend, who I killed!

223
00:18:36,573 --> 00:18:38,848
What happened?
Why am I in my apartment?

224
00:18:39,053 --> 00:18:40,452
You killed Fry!

225
00:18:40,653 --> 00:18:42,132
You killed Fry!

226
00:18:42,333 --> 00:18:44,164
You killed Fry!
Stop it!

227
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:45,692
Stop it!

228
00:18:47,373 --> 00:18:49,284
You killed Fry.

229
00:18:51,773 --> 00:18:56,130
Okay, I'm insane.
But I'm still sane enough to know it.

230
00:18:56,333 --> 00:19:00,963
The only time I feel all
right is in my dreams with you.

231
00:19:01,173 --> 00:19:05,291
Three spoonfuls,
then I can dream forever.

232
00:19:07,693 --> 00:19:09,285
One.

233
00:19:11,493 --> 00:19:13,085
Two.

234
00:19:13,253 --> 00:19:16,529
Here goes.
Goodbye, waking world.

235
00:19:18,453 --> 00:19:21,126
Leela, no!
Listen to me!

236
00:19:21,293 --> 00:19:24,365
You don't want to lie in bed and
do nothing the rest of your life.

237
00:19:24,533 --> 00:19:28,412
I've tried it. Bedsores hurt!
Then what am I supposed to do?

238
00:19:28,613 --> 00:19:30,126
Fight it!
I can't!

239
00:19:30,333 --> 00:19:32,767
You can! The Leela I know
doesn't give up this easily.

240
00:19:33,253 --> 00:19:36,165
Okay, I'll try.

241
00:19:38,293 --> 00:19:39,612
Go away!

242
00:19:44,413 --> 00:19:48,247
I don't know if you can hear me.
But there's something I wanna tell you.

243
00:19:48,413 --> 00:19:51,132
I love you.
I'm so scared, Fry!

244
00:19:51,293 --> 00:19:54,683
I don't know what to do!
Just wake up, Leela. Please.

245
00:19:54,853 --> 00:19:58,448
Just wake up.
I don't understand what you mean!

246
00:19:59,293 --> 00:20:03,366
Just wake up.
Please. Just wake up, Leela.

247
00:20:07,093 --> 00:20:10,881
Fry. You're alive.
Leela! You're awake!

248
00:20:11,093 --> 00:20:15,166
Of course I'm awake. You wouldn't
stop waking me. Where am I?

249
00:20:15,333 --> 00:20:18,450
In a hospital. The ambulance took
you here after the bee stung you.

250
00:20:18,613 --> 00:20:21,127
But the bee stung you.
It barely touched me.

251
00:20:21,933 --> 00:20:24,493
The stinger went through me
and you got all the poison.

252
00:20:24,653 --> 00:20:29,010
My new spleen came from a guy who
liked to motorcycle. Vroom, vroom.

253
00:20:29,613 --> 00:20:33,242
Sweet three-Toed sloth of
ice planet Hoth, she's awake!

254
00:20:34,933 --> 00:20:36,924
You were in the best
coma I've ever seen!

255
00:20:37,093 --> 00:20:39,049
The doctor said you'd never wake up.

256
00:20:39,253 --> 00:20:42,290
Really? How long was I out?
Two weeks.

257
00:20:42,493 --> 00:20:44,290
Fry never left your side for a minute.

258
00:20:44,453 --> 00:20:47,525
And he talked nonstop.
Like a parrot of the sea, he was.

259
00:20:47,733 --> 00:20:50,167
I thought maybe if you
heard a familiar voice...

260
00:20:50,333 --> 00:20:52,244
It might help keep your mind together.

261
00:20:52,413 --> 00:20:56,884
But who knows if it really got through?
It got through, Fry.

262
00:20:57,053 --> 00:20:59,044
It got through.

263
00:20:59,933 --> 00:21:03,130
You could really use a shower.
You too.
