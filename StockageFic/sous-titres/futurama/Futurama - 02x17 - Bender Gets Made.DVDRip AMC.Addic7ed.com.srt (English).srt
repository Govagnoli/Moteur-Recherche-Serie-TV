00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:09,316
Bender Gets Made

2
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:39,755
I'm gonna see my favorite chef...

3
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:43,475
...TV's Elzar! This is the greatest
second of my life!

4
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:44,795
No, this one is!

5
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,389
Wait, that one was worse.

6
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:50,279
Ah, so far so good on this one!

7
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:54,472
<i>Now, here he is:</i>
<i>Chef, restaurateur...</i>

8
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:58,918
<i>... author of</i> Cooking Slugs For Dinner
<i>and</i> Cooking Dinner for Slugs...

9
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:01,111
<i>... EIzar!</i>

10
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:03,078
Yeah!

11
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:07,478
All right! Yeah! Yeah, baby! Whoo!

12
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:11,158
Elzar!

13
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,473
All right!

14
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:16,312
Elzar, you're my god!

15
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,472
Please sign this sketch I drew of you!

16
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:24,592
Elzar! Bless you!

17
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:31,309
Now, this is why I prefer
your non-stick robots.

18
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:41,792
All right! Yeah!

19
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,679
I hope you folks like Cajun food.

20
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,674
Because we're making down-home
Neptune-style gumbo.

21
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:59,000
Step one: Boil some oysters in a pot
of Neptune-style gumbo.

22
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:01,196
Boiled? Interesting!

23
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:05,149
- Bender, try to be a little quieter.
- No, you shut up!

24
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:09,592
Now and then, knock it up a notch
with your spice weasel.

25
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:10,829
Bam!

26
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:14,032
Yeah! Bam it again!
Knock it up a notch!

27
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:16,310
Who let him into the studio?

28
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:19,637
Come on! Work that weasel!
<i>Q</i>uit holding out!

29
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,596
If you stop interrupting,
all right.

30
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:25,673
Against my will,
I'll knock it up a notch.

31
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:28,440
I gotta film this notch-up knocking.

32
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:29,789
Think fast!

33
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:34,871
My eye! I'm blind!

34
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:46,359
Tell me, doctor, how's my cyst?

35
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:47,795
<i>Grande.</i>

36
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:55,590
I don't like this doctor. I've lost
more patients than he's treated.

37
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,995
What does this look like?

38
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:00,229
A grayish blob?

39
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:02,874
Right. And this one?

40
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,190
A grayish blob?

41
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:09,269
Not as right that time.
You have some corneal irritation.

42
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,072
Nice try, little boy.

43
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:15,074
You may have textbook knowledge
and a real diploma...

44
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:20,070
...but I have more skill in my claw
than you have in your whole body!

45
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:23,036
You seem tense. Try these.

46
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:27,870
Sure. Butter me up with candy.
Well, it won't work, sonny!

47
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,116
Why always the fighting?

48
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:35,830
Your eye needs rest.
Wear this patch for a week.

49
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:39,317
A week? What do you think,
Dr. Zoidberg?

50
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,389
Clack.

51
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:48,080
Thanks for the help, Leela.

52
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:52,238
Leela! We're right here!

53
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:55,477
I'm not deaf!
I just have to wear a patch.

54
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,557
Does it look stupid?

55
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:01,355
No! It looks so nice,
I think I might get one too.

56
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:03,309
It's Elzar!

57
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:06,796
I'm so excited I wish
I could wet my pants!

58
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,468
Let me make this up to you.

59
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:12,712
You're all invited to my restaurant.

60
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:15,599
I'll bam up a dinner you won't forget!

61
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:16,750
- All right!
- Yeah!

62
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:18,678
Hooray for blind-ey!

63
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:21,553
Oh, God. I'm coming down!

64
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:29,237
Watch your mouth because your
taste buds are going on vacation.

65
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:33,479
I made you each your own special meal,
so dig in!

66
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:36,679
It's the biggest platter
I've ever seen!

67
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:41,630
Jerk chicken, jerk beef, jerk pork!
Is there any meat he can't jerk?

68
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:46,994
The king crab is to die for!
Look, a tiny, edible crown!

69
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:49,316
- What's it made of?
- Wood.

70
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:53,796
Oh, Fry! You gotta try this
sterno-nicoise.

71
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,558
It's robot food.

72
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:58,354
It's so good! Just try a little.

73
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,471
No, really, I don't...

74
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:06,194
Are you all right?

75
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:08,874
Oh, yeah, the salad's fantastic!

76
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:11,071
So fresh.

77
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:26,199
Oh, my! That steamed carrot
was a bit spicy.

78
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:27,793
Enjoy the dinner?

79
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,878
- Are you kidding?
- God, yes, Elzar!

80
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:35,870
I enjoyed cooking for you.
And to make everything square...

81
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:39,590
...I want you to have
these chocolates.

82
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:42,548
What's this?

83
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,751
Take care of that whenever you want.

84
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:47,110
- Hey!
- A bill?

85
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:49,914
You're charging us,
after you blinded me?

86
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:52,680
I made a nice meal.
This ain't a charity.

87
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:56,156
- Twelve hundred dollars?
- Holy zombie Jesus!

88
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:59,238
We don't have that!
Especially not him.

89
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,635
They took away my credit cards.

90
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:05,316
I know how to take care of this.
No problem.

91
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:08,231
You're all under arrest.

92
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:11,000
It's a stone cold shame.

93
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:13,678
He's making a break for it!

94
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:17,913
- I was picking my nose.
- Picking his nose! Get him!

95
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:29,234
My daddy owned a restaurant
and punks like you made him fail.

96
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,998
That's why I'm a cop.

97
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:34,317
Now it's payback time. Oh, yeah.

98
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,676
Don't hit me! I'm brittle!

99
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:39,474
Wait! I've got the perfect solution!

100
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,318
Listen to the robot!

101
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:44,518
I love cooking,
and he needs help, right?

102
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:49,032
- No question.
- How about I work to pay off our debt?

103
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:53,711
I don't know. I try to hire people
who are less unbearable.

104
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:56,878
- Bender's a model employee!
- He's so polite!

105
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:59,116
- And hardworking.
- He's made of candy.

106
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:01,390
Okay, I'll give it a shot.

107
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:04,438
- All right! Yeah!
- Hot diggety!

108
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:06,676
You better keep your nose clean.

109
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:09,514
That'll be easy. I never wear it.

110
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:17,191
Time for my precious 10 a.m. meeting!

111
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,713
Where is Leela?

112
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:23,191
I'm here.
And I'm getting along fine, thanks.

113
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:26,473
My walk took a little
longer than usual.

114
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:29,672
Nibbler took me through the zoo.

115
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:36,313
Don't be embarrassed about
needing help.

116
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,039
I could do your makeup.

117
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:42,472
I don't need help.
I did this all by myself.

118
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:46,918
You look beautiful!
My favorite artist is Picasso!

119
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:49,071
I'm off to the restaurant.

120
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,430
Someone can fill in for me.

121
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:55,076
I'll build someone to fill in for you!

122
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:58,317
A gamma-powered mechanical monster...

123
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:02,678
...with freeway on-ramps for arms,
and a coal-black heart!

124
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:05,878
If that guy can't handle it,
let me know.

125
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:11,592
I'm done siphoning out
the grease trap. I need a mint.

126
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,717
What job do I move up to?

127
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:17,077
Pastry chef? Saucier? Soup guy?

128
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,998
Bam!

129
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:21,071
Bam yourself.

130
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,075
Who are they?

131
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:30,512
They're very good customers,
and that's all I can say.

132
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,910
- Are they the Robot Mafia?
- Yes.

133
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:36,476
You call this a table?
You call this a table?

134
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:38,671
I wouldn't hit a guy with this!

135
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,791
The Don-Bot don't like it!

136
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,275
I ought to clamp you!

137
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:48,719
Calm down, Clamps. The boss likes
to put his back against a wall...

138
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,552
...like this there.

139
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:51,869
But that table's...

140
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:54,475
Let me bus that for you!

141
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,759
What I meant to do was...

142
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,917
- Oh!
- I can't believe this!

143
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:03,316
Get out!

144
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:09,438
I like this guy's lack of style.

145
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,471
I give the guy cement shoes...

146
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:17,070
...which he likes better
than his lead ones.

147
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:19,350
You think this computes?

148
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:21,198
I gave you a hundred.

149
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:22,515
You gave me a fifty.

150
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,233
- No, I didn't.
- You did.

151
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,158
You stealing from him?

152
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:28,316
I'm trying, but it's not easy.

153
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,916
Check out his ball bearings.

154
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,595
Here's something for you.

155
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:44,798
- It's money.
- Wow, thanks.

156
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,797
You earned that fifty.

157
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,479
- It's a twenty.
- It is?

158
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:52,070
Oh, I'm sorry, I meant to...
Wait a minute!

159
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:57,994
Say, you wanna work for me
as a hired goon?

160
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:01,277
I've always wanted to be a goon!

161
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:03,277
Hey, Elzar! I quit!

162
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:04,435
Okay!

163
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:07,108
We're gonna start with a delivery.

164
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:09,993
It's for a private lottery we run.

165
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:12,156
Wow! You guys run numbers?

166
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:14,669
Ones and zeroes mostly.

167
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:19,118
Take this disk to Sammy
"The Mechanical Bull" Gravano.

168
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,918
Watch out for cops.

169
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,395
That's what my mom said.

170
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:44,275
That's good oil-aide, son.
We could use you in the Robot Mafia.

171
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,993
Which I'm sort of in.

172
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,872
You flatter me, kind goon.

173
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:53,234
I'm programmed to only sell oil-aide
and write cute backwards letters.

174
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,872
Oh, crap. The cops!

175
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:58,031
- See anything suspicious?
- Nope.

176
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,391
But check out today's "Marmaduke. "
Solid.

177
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,319
Hey, it's that skell from Elzar's!

178
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:08,479
Undercover pursuit in progress... baby.

179
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,395
- Gotcha!
- What's the problem?

180
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:19,792
- Was I speeding?
- We'll decide that after a search.

181
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,429
He's clean.

182
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:24,959
Smells nice too.

183
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:27,310
- Better than me?
- Oh, yeah.

184
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,676
Courtesy of Mr. Bender.

185
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,670
Nice job. You passed the test.

186
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:41,829
You want to join us at our social club
tomorrow night?

187
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:44,270
I'd rather plan some felonies.

188
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:47,153
Then we should meet
at our headquarters.

189
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:55,789
Don-Bot, please.
I can't make the loan payment.

190
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,039
Look into your hard drive
and open your mercy file.

191
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,072
File not found.

192
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:12,914
That's a warning.

193
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:15,312
Thank you, Don-Bot.

194
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:17,551
Joey. Clamps. Donny-B.

195
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:21,514
We got a big score planned,
but we need some muscle.

196
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:23,711
A little of this, huh?

197
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:26,679
This guy's got the strength of an ox.

198
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,758
He needs a nickname! How about Clamps?

199
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:34,670
That's my name, you numbskull!
Don't make me clamp you one!

200
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:35,790
How's Blotto?

201
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:39,874
It's gritty, and I can keep
my monogrammed slippers.

202
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,758
Good thinking! Hey!

203
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:46,954
This score ain't gonna be easy.
There may be some death killing.

204
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:50,516
It'll be clamp this, clamp that,
ba-da-clamp!

205
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:52,239
Well, Blotto? You in?

206
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:56,513
It's funny.
I always wanted to be a gangster.

207
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:58,193
The answer is yes!

208
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:01,073
- Yeah!
- Way to go! Way to be! Way to shoot!

209
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:04,078
Since we'll be committing crimes...

210
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,799
...you'll want an alibi.

211
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,672
An alibi, huh?

212
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:16,756
I don't feel good. I'm genuinely sick.

213
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:19,679
We gotta eat our blast-off sundaes!

214
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:23,350
I can't move.
Oh, I think I'm gonna output.

215
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:26,472
You stay in bed. I'll eat yours.

216
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:33,152
Bender's sick.
Need any help taking off?

217
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:37,273
I'm fine. A real pilot
can navigate by feel alone.

218
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:43,479
That's coming out of your pay!

219
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:51,315
The secret of robot cooking:

220
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:55,109
Start with a high-quality oil.
Then eat it.

221
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,876
So, what's this big score?

222
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:00,071
Heisting Zuban cigars.

223
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:03,192
Those are the best cigars
in the universe!

224
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:06,318
I can stink up a hospital
with one of those!

225
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:09,717
There he is.
Let's shoot bullets at him.

226
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,672
Here's the battle plan.

227
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:32,110
We shoot, they surrender...

228
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:35,193
...we get the cigars and go home.

229
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:39,678
All without any killing.
You've got some fresh new ideas!

230
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,074
I admire that.

231
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:44,431
- We'll kill them.
- We got them out-clamped.

232
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:46,835
They won't know what clamped them!

233
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:52,238
Too bad you can't see...

234
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:56,069
...because there's a ship
shooting at somebody.

235
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,631
I'm taking evasive action!

236
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:01,308
- Uh, Leela?
- Stop bothering me!

237
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:03,152
I need full concentration!

238
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:25,238
<i>- Missile evaded.</i>
- Eyes are for chumps.

239
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:28,079
Their desire to live
shows me no respect.

240
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:31,471
Roll down a window and start shooting.

241
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:49,590
Oh, he got me!
What a shot that guy is!

242
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:52,519
Wait, the letters that normally say...

243
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:57,675
..."Master Steering Wheel Co. " say
"Nibbler. " Oh, no!

244
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:03,869
<i>I'm back at the wheel, Fry.</i>

245
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:08,312
Great. The one time I forgot
to buy flight insurance!

246
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:17,590
They're coming this way!
You should clamp them!

247
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:18,949
Gee, you think?

248
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:24,359
Think I should use these clamps that
I use every day, at every opportunity?

249
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,836
You're a genius, you idiot!

250
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:41,073
The engine's stalled!
I'm trying the manual fuel pump!

251
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:45,470
Hello. We're the Robot Mafia.

252
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,591
The entire Robot Mafia.

253
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:49,199
We're taking the cigars.

254
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,795
- You can't!
- Unless you let us live!

255
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,319
Then you'll get off.

256
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:57,354
Blindfold them
before they see us some more.

257
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,873
Boss, somebody beat us to it.

258
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:04,469
That's a joke at my expense.

259
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:08,076
Well, who's laughing now?

260
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:10,950
Where's Blotto?

261
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:13,515
He should be here,
learning the trade.

262
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:21,555
Sorry I'm tardy, old bean.
I was enjoying a watercress sandwich.

263
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:25,196
He's classier than I thought.
Tie them up!

264
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:26,992
Capital idea!

265
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:39,869
I say, get the hell off me!

266
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:41,672
He sounds familiar.

267
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:49,679
My word, what have we...?

268
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,518
Nothing to see here!

269
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:57,951
Hey, boss.
This crew list lists a robot.

270
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:02,950
Okay. I want you to find him
and plug him. Then unplug him.

271
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:06,670
- No!
- I got a surprise for that guy:

272
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,876
The clamps!

273
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:13,071
Wait, Old Spice.

274
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:18,033
Let me get this chap!
I can be quite rough.

275
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:21,308
Poor Bender.

276
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:25,678
Oh, I don't feel good.

277
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:30,428
Chew on this! What ho!
Stop it!

278
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,073
Take that, you twit!

279
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,470
No, stop it!

280
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:44,949
That's the last of them.

281
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:47,276
Now let's mafia things up.

282
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:51,109
Joey, burn the ship.
Clamps, burn the crew.

283
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:53,999
Donny, give me a chance here, huh?

284
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:57,277
Let me take care of the dirty work.

285
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:00,717
Hey, I like your attitude.
And your accent.

286
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:05,431
Keep it up and I might get you
your own pair of clamps.

287
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:07,596
He's gonna get clamps?

288
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:11,515
Clamps! Clamps, clamps, clamps.

289
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,476
We may not have much time...

290
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:20,990
...so let's spend all of it
talking about Bender.

291
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:24,391
He was like a computer
that ran on magic.

292
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:27,678
Help! Help!

293
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:29,194
- Bender!
- You're okay!

294
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:32,995
Yes, I am!
Having just regained consciousness!

295
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,792
I've got an idea.

296
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:39,432
It's about to break! Yes!

297
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:42,791
- All right!
- It broke all right!

298
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:48,719
Leela was in command,
and when she kicked, it hurt.

299
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:50,069
It really hurt.

300
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:53,949
This is the big moment.
I can take my patch off.

301
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,673
I'll do the snipping.

302
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:59,839
After all,
I do have the proper equipment.

303
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,388
It's Blotto!

304
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,830
That gangster I saw!

305
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:15,912
Professor? Where were you last night?

306
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:18,469
Where am I now?

307
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:23,869
They sent a child to kill me!

308
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:26,310
I'm not going without a fight!

309
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:32,634
Fine kick, sir. But I'm here
to deliver your cut from the heist.

310
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:35,559
Oh, sweet legal tender!

311
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:43,272
Tell the Don-Bot
I quit organized crime.

312
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:45,869
I'll stick to the regular kind.

313
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:49,877
It's funny.
With you sick and Leela blind...

314
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:51,951
...only I know what went on.

315
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:54,116
Maybe someday I'll tell.

316
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:59,110
And maybe someday I won't listen.
