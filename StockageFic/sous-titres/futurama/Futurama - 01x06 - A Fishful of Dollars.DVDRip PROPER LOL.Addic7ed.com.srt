I don't know. I've had cow.

336
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:30,920
Gross!

337
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:32,240
Mmm.

338
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:37,280
No one likes them at first.
They'll grow on you.

339
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:43,000
That stench! That heavenly stench!

340
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:46,840
More.

341
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:49,160
There's no more.
There never will be.

342
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:52,000
More! More!

343
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:54,600
More!
