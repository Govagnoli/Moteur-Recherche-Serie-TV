1
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:09,351
Put Your Head on My Shoulders

2
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:36,149
Four score and 1145 years ago...

3
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:40,154
...our forefathers' foreheads
conceived a new nation.

4
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:45,560
This Presidents' Day, we honor the
values my body fought and died for.

5
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:48,598
Values like this new Plymouth V'ger.

6
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:50,632
I'm Malfunctioning Eddie...

7
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:55,396
...and I'm malfunctioning so badly,
I'm giving these cars away!

8
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:00,754
Let's go car shopping! My parents said
if I got B's, they'd buy me a bar.

9
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,319
I got all C's!

10
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:05,956
Mind if I tag along?
My ass needs servicing.

11
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:09,670
This says it could catch fire
in a collision.

12
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:12,633
No wonder you're
at the end of conga lines.

13
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:15,798
I'll get my coat. Let's go, Bender.

14
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:26,239
I'm Victor, and I know many things
about the art of unloading fine cars...

15
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:28,078
...on beautiful women.

16
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:31,478
Now tell us she's witty
and sophisticated.

17
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:35,916
A gentleman always
sells a lady a car first.

18
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:40,119
This is a Beta Romeo.
Yes, the Beta Romeo.

19
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:45,554
Note the cross-your-heart seat belt.
It protects, lifts and separates.

20
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:53,155
Spotted her when you walked in, huh?
She's a beauty.

21
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:55,118
Yeah, beautiful coffee.

22
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:57,880
No, the Ford Thunder
Cougar Falcon Bird!

23
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:01,511
Nothing makes you feel
more like a man.

24
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:05,110
- How much do you want to spend?
- I'm not buying.

25
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:09,518
I see you don't care if people
question your sexual orientation.

26
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:12,712
I do, but I don't know how
to make them stop!

27
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:15,229
Thunder Cougar Falcon Bird.

28
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:18,830
The seats are stuffed
with eagle down...

29
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:22,157
...the dash inlaid
with beaks of eagles.

30
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,517
There are eagles
under the floorboards.

31
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:30,595
- That's an awful lot of eagle.
- Yes. And yet...

32
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:35,397
- What's wrong?
- The luxury edition has more eagle.

33
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:40,031
- It's sad to think you're missing out.
- Oh, don't be sad.

34
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:43,795
My parents are paying
and they're incredibly rich.

35
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:58,717
I installed bumpers to reduce
the risk of butt failure.

36
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:02,910
You, sir, have defaced
a national treasure!

37
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:07,193
I demand you restore my buttocks
to their former glory!

38
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:12,349
All right, but that ass is gonna blow,
and when it does...

39
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:16,388
...I pray you're not mooning
someone you care about.

40
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:21,037
This car has everything
a beautiful woman like me needs.

41
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:22,514
Victor said so.

42
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,558
No dog food for Victor tonight!

43
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:31,510
The sticker says $55,000.
But we'll only go as high as, say...

44
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,557
Sixty thousand!

45
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:37,229
I'll have to ask my manager.

46
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:42,640
- You don't go above the sticker price.
- I thought it was an auction.

47
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:49,598
- He is not too happy.
- I'm sorry. Eighty thousand?

48
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:58,870
I'm terrible at parallel parking.

49
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:05,639
You're asking for a day off?
Get out of my sight!

50
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:08,235
You're bogarting my patience.

51
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,318
Who were you yelling at?

52
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:15,714
I asked me for Valentine's Day off.
I was in no mood for my shenanigans.

53
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:20,311
Valentine's Day's coming?
I forgot to get a girlfriend again.

54
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:25,315
- Since we have no dates, we should...
- You assume I can't get a date?

55
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,479
How about 8:00?

56
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:31,230
I'm taking my new car to Mercury.
Wanna come?

57
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:35,758
- Okay. How's the weather?
- The usual. Boiling lead, lava.

58
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,519
So, what? Shorts?

59
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:52,195
Boy, this a/c is incredible.
I better turn on the heater too.

60
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:05,317
This heater is incredible!
I better turn up the a/c some more.

61
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:09,636
- How about some icy margaritas?
- Yeah!

62
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:19,759
- We're slowing down!
- I'll hit the fuel guzzler!

63
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:24,510
Who wants Pop-Tarts?

64
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:40,513
It's okay. I have an emergency phone.

65
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:47,991
- What are you doing?
- It's a videophone.

66
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:53,554
I'm in the Astro-Afro-
Antarctico-Amerasian Auto Association.

67
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,034
Hello? Septuple A?

68
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,911
It'll be a couple hours.

69
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,351
Oh, I'm gonna get sweat
on my sweat suit.

70
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:13,791
You're rich. How come you dress
like you're doing your laundry?

71
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:17,755
My parents tell me
to be more ladylike. As though.

72
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:22,830
My folks were always on me to wear
underpants. What am I, the pope?

73
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:27,113
If you were, they'd be all,
"Straighten your pope hat"...

74
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,113
...and "Put on your good vestments. "

75
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:36,551
It's nice to find someone
I can talk to about stuff, and junk.

76
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:42,039
It's like we feel the same way
about junk and stuff, or whatever.

77
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:03,990
- While they tow us, you wanna do it?
- Yeah!

78
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:15,116
Which concludes the summary
of the movie I saw.

79
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:17,151
- Any old business?
- No.

80
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,476
- Any new business?
- No.

81
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:21,512
- Anyone sleep together?
- No.

82
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:23,193
- Yep.
- Kind of.

83
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,674
- What?
- Oh, my God!

84
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:32,159
- One thing led to another.
- It led there again when we got home.

85
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:38,439
You snagged the perfect girlfriend.

86
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:42,150
Amy's rich, she's probably
got other characteristics...

87
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,675
Bender, romance isn't about money.

88
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:49,909
It's coincidence that Zoidberg is
desperately poor and miserably Ionely?

89
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,109
Please!

90
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:55,518
For your information,
it's because he's hideous.

91
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:59,078
They go together like
a lime and a coconut.

92
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:02,318
- Do I hear wedding bells?
- What? No!

93
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,710
Really? Oh, dear.

94
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:10,708
You're both very lucky. I'd pay
to end my miserable Ioneliness.

95
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:13,474
If I weren't so desperately poor.

96
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:16,672
People will pay good money
for romance?

97
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:20,437
I have a scheme
so deviously clever that I...

98
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:24,869
- $500 and time served.
- Stupid anti-pimping laws.

99
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,752
Well, pay the man!

100
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,390
- Honey, we love you!
- Shut up, baby, I know it!

101
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:39,948
Computer dating. Like pimping,
but you rarely say "upside your head. "

102
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:45,872
- Why would anyone ask you for help?
- Don't make me go upside your head!

103
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:52,073
Fry? Amy? Put your pants back on!
I need a stapler!

104
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,519
If you disrupt the mating dance...

105
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:59,514
...the male will maul us
with his fearsome gonad.

106
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:02,917
It's working.
They think we're making out.

107
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:07,272
- Why aren't we making out?
- I don't know.

108
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:14,478
- Okay, Mister...?
- Smith. Zapp Smith. Brannigan.

109
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:17,228
Check off what you look for
in a mate.

110
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:22,116
Let's see. Oh, yes. Yes, definitely.

111
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,311
I'd like some of that.

112
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:28,030
I'll just have everything on the menu.

113
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:32,711
I'll run it through our high-speed
Romance-A-Logical Datafier.

114
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,276
- Say hello to Miss Right.
- Hello.

115
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,909
Wow, we're great kissers.

116
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:52,311
Hey, later you want
to drive out to Europa?

117
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:55,114
We can picnic and spit at Jupiter.

118
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:58,551
I used to spit at stuff
in the 20th century.

119
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,917
Cool how we think alike, and junk.

120
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:05,709
Yeah. You know, Fry,
I like hanging out with you.

121
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:11,752
It was great. But now she's talking
about hanging out.

122
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,516
She's getting way too serious.
I'm not a one-woman man, Leela.

123
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:20,509
- You'll be back to zero soon.
- She's smothering me.

124
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:24,030
- Hi.
- You see? She's bothering me at work!

125
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,515
I do my job, there's Amy.

126
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:29,518
I go to the candy machine,
there's Amy.

127
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:32,314
I sleep with Amy, there's Amy.

128
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:35,717
- I think you're overreacting.
- Am I? Am I?!

129
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:40,750
Face it, I'm a prize catch.
I'm pulling down delivery boy money.

130
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:45,556
- She has billions in a trust fund.
- She wants a trophy husband.

131
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:49,037
Come to Europa with us.
We can't be alone.

132
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:51,999
Ready for a picnic, just you and me?

133
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:55,909
You know who loves picnics
with just you and me?

134
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,912
Dr. Zoidberg.

135
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,397
Did someone say something
about a free meal?

136
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:14,155
I haven't eaten since Tuesday.

137
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,709
Bird eggs. Animal slices.

138
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,631
Dry woven reeds.

139
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:22,952
All gone. Can I drive?

140
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:27,358
No. Fry, you busy tomorrow?
I got tickets to the ape fight.

141
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:31,155
We'll spend Valentine's Day
together, isn't it enough?

142
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,876
Sure. What do you want
to do for Valentine's Day?

143
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:38,197
- Now we're doing Valentine's Day?
- You said...

144
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:41,790
We have to talk! Zoidberg, you drive!

145
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,357
Pardon me. Excuse me.

146
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:48,429
I'll just turn the wheel
to maximum fastness.

147
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:53,110
You know how you like chocolate
but get tired of it...

148
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,715
...when it always
wants to hang out?

149
00:11:55,920 --> 00:12:00,038
- You don't like chocolate?
- Can chocolate let me finish?

150
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:05,395
And the winner of the big car race is
Hot Rod Zoidberg!

151
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:11,119
What I'm trying to say is,
I think we should stop...

152
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,399
Here, you drive.

153
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:28,156
Fry? Are you all right?

154
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:32,279
My head's killing me.
What happened? Was anyone hurt?

155
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:35,836
No, no, no. Of course not.
Nobody but you.

156
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:39,117
Your body was badly damaged
in the crash.

157
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:41,994
- How badly?
- That's it over there.

158
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:47,793
I managed to keep your head
alive with some quick surgery.

159
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:49,832
- Where is it?
- There.

160
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:54,593
Looks like we'll be spending
a lot more time together, Fry.

161
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:03,957
This always happens
with office romances.

162
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:08,318
We'll have your body
all fixed up in a few days.

163
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:10,078
Upsy-daisy.

164
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:15,512
I'll try not to interfere
in your life.

165
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:19,076
- Fry?
- Sorry. I guess I control that arm.

166
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,953
What'd you want to talk about, anyway?

167
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:29,149
Maybe we'd better talk in private.
I'll meet you in the closet.

168
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:34,556
I like you as a friend. But we're
spending too much time together.

169
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:38,958
- You're breaking up with me?
- We should see other people.

170
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:42,909
I was really having fun.
If that's how you feel.

171
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,997
I'm sorry, but it is.

172
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:51,389
If we're not seeing each other, can I
get another date for Valentine's Day?

173
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:55,958
- Unless it would make you feel bad.
- Hey, I can get a date too.

174
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:58,509
I can attract all sorts of women.

175
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:02,713
With my body, I think
you'll only attract one sort of woman.

176
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:11,070
So, how's business?

177
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,878
Are you familiar
with my friend Al Gore?

178
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:19,630
Losers get really desperate
around Valentine's Day.

179
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:22,753
Yeah, it's pathetic, all right.

180
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,238
- How much?
- Five hundred bucks.

181
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:29,919
- Done.
- Brannigan okay?

182
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,315
- No!
- Six hundred.

183
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:44,558
Leela? Can I talk to you
for a minute in private?

184
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,074
No problem.

185
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:52,836
Amy made Valentine's plans
with some goon...

186
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:55,548
...and I'm gonna be stuck there.

187
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:58,308
Will you be my date? Please?

188
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:02,513
Too late, I'm sharing Valentine's
with a special man.

189
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,199
Not Zapp Brannigan.

190
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:08,632
Then I have to do something
so pitiful that I'm ashamed to tell.

191
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:10,911
- Bender's in his office.
- Thanks.

192
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:18,315
I got your hookup. My fee's 500 bucks,
but seeing how it's you...

193
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:20,476
...I'll need it in advance.

194
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:25,915
Okay, we're done with the bra.

195
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:30,950
Why did you shave? Expecting
something to happen with the date?

196
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:35,159
- None of your business.
- And that's a lot of makeup.

197
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:37,868
- It's deodorant.
- What does it do?

198
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:41,756
Come in, Gary.
I'll just be another 20 minutes!

199
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,831
I'll be waiting!

200
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:46,156
20 minutes? You're ready now!

201
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:50,512
- It's good to make them wait a little.
- Oh, God, it's true!

202
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:00,192
- That dress looks great on you.
- Thanks.

203
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,311
Where is she?

204
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:08,119
I must say, Amy, you're all made up.
Just like Fry's date. Get it?

205
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:10,750
I've got a date. She's coming.

206
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,710
Fry, look who I found!
It's Petunia, your dream girl!

207
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:18,793
How's them eats?
Don't mind if I do.

208
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:21,949
- Kids will be hungry.
- She seems old.

209
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:25,317
She's well-traveled.
I don't mean she travels.

210
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:29,155
- Wheels fell off my house.
- Rose? Five bucks.

211
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:30,628
I'll take one.

212
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:33,030
- Me too.
- Eight bucks.

213
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:36,596
- You said...
- Demand skyrocketed. You all saw it.

214
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:44,756
Leela, meet your future husband, Sal.

215
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,878
- Nice eyeball, Eyeball.
- Nice ass, Ass.

216
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:51,550
Sparks! Buy her a rose,
I promise she'll put out.

217
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:54,638
I'll take my chances.

218
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:01,031
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

219
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:04,028
Tell me, you a good gambler?

220
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:07,153
- Well, I...
- What's your game? Bingo? Keno?

221
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,470
You don't have your own body!

222
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:12,320
- I control this arm.
- Slots player?

223
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:16,593
- Sorry, but I can do better.
- Wait! Come back, darling!

224
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:19,553
I gotta catch my bus back to Nutley.

225
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:22,473
I'd kiss you but I lost my teeth.

226
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:25,513
I'd love to take a whack at you...

227
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:30,032
...but the 10: 15 to Nutley
ain't going without me driving.

228
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:34,034
Excuse me, did you say
" 10: 15 to Nutley"?

229
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:36,236
Why, yes I did.

230
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:48,111
Did you round up our dates
at the bus station?

231
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:51,073
- Of course not.
- Anybody else for Nutley?

232
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:56,792
Wait, you didn't
show me your surprise!

233
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:03,158
- You know what I'd like to do...
- Oh, jeez, get a room.

234
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:04,879
Maybe later.

235
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:09,195
I have an idea!
Let's go out for ice cream.

236
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:12,950
I thought Amy could come
to my place for coffee.

237
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:15,959
- I don't like coffee.
- Neither do I.

238
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,116
I feel a little tipsy.

239
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,716
Let me pick up the check.

240
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:27,233
No!

241
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:37,152
That's it! I'm getting out of here!

242
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,356
If it isn't my favorite head
on Amy's body: Fry!

243
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:50,433
- Oh, Leela.
- We were just on our way out.

244
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:55,708
Nonsense. The evening's young.
So, Gary, what do you do for a living?

245
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,434
Banking industry regulator.

246
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:03,919
Really? I heard that banking industry
regulations are very simple.

247
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:05,679
That's not true.

248
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:11,079
Modern banking regulations are a
product of five regulatory traditions.

249
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:14,756
- Six, if you want to get technical.
- Oh, I do.

250
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:19,551
It began in 1410, when a number
of noblemen convened with the...

251
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,153
Thank you.

252
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:27,556
There, good as new.
Except your dorsal fin.

253
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:30,314
I couldn't find it after the crash.

254
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:33,313
- I'll live without it?
- You call that living?

255
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:38,116
Why wouldn't you let me graft
a laser cannon on your chest?

256
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:41,517
To crush those who disobey you.

257
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:44,558
I guess we're two different people.

258
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:49,834
Thanks for the ride, Amy. No hard
feelings about your date, or stuff.

259
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:52,719
I had fun. If I ever feel Ionely...

260
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:56,833
...I'll look at this disfiguring scar
and think of you.

261
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:03,351
Anyway, it's nice to have
my own body back.

262
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:10,714
How's the corpse? Hooked up okay?

263
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:14,037
Seems to be. My neck's
just a little tender.

264
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,549
Cool! Ow!

265
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:19,633
Thanks for rescuing me last night.

266
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:22,514
Anytime. I enjoyed hanging out.

267
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:26,030
Everything worked out great,
thanks to Bender.

268
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:29,556
It's not like you
set us up with bad dates...

269
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,955
...just so we'd be together.

270
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:35,312
Didn't I, Leela? Didn't I?

271
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:41,358
No! You just corralled some stiffs
at the bus station and took our money.

272
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:46,668
True. But in the end, isn't that what
Valentine's Day is all about?

273
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,473
- Yeah.
- I guess so.

274
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:52,913
Watch the neck!

275
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:55,310
My ass! My beautiful...
