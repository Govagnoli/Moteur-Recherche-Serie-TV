00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:09,231
Futurama [5x03] - The Route Of All Evil - CiWaN

2
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:38,869
Ah, beer. So many choices.
And it makes so little difference.

3
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:41,110
How about Lobrau?
It has dots on it.

4
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:45,313
Overruled! The choice of
champions is Pabst Blue Robot.

5
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:48,438
I can't drink that. The metal
shavings make my throat bloody.

6
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:51,516
Baby wants a Zima.

7
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:54,672
Hey, hey. We can all
fight when we're drunk.

8
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:56,871
Listen, why don't we
just brew our own beer?

9
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:58,513
You can brew your own beer?

10
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:01,712
Sure. The kids at the orphanarium
used to do it all the time.

11
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:11,477
Cursed bacteria of Liberia! My own son,
suspended from boarding school.

12
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,875
It's not my fault, Dad.
And you, Cubert.

13
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:18,153
I cloned you from one of my warts,
and I can send you straight back there.

14
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:22,909
What's going on? Is this angry
yelling, or busted-Hearing-Aid yelling?

15
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:24,678
I'm afraid it's both.
What?

16
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:27,274
Now, hold on.
Everyone cool your daiquiris.

17
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:30,318
Let's give the little vermin
a chance to explain themselves.

18
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:35,275
It was self-Defense, Mom. Just look
at this letter the principal sent.

19
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:38,354
We were in science class...

20
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:41,034
And we had finished building
a miniature black hole.

21
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:44,073
That was easy.
Pretty scrawny black hole.

22
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:46,549
It must be hungry.

23
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:50,030
Black holes don't need food.
Neither do nerds.

24
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,074
My Manwich!

25
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:59,793
That's it. You've compressed
our lunches to a singularity...

26
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:03,430
For the last time. Salt him, Dwight.

27
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:10,396
When I re-Solidify, I'm gonna
put you in a world of goop.

28
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:14,998
See? That bully started it.
We couldn't fight back with brawn...

29
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:19,312
So we used our brains.
I warned you not to use those things!

30
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:24,273
Let's see. We've got our malt.
Our hops.

31
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:27,159
We just need a big
disposable tub to mix it in.

32
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:35,196
Now it needs to boil for a couple hours.

33
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,078
Dwight, you remember the crew?
Yeah.

34
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:45,198
Crew, you remember Cubert?
Yeah.

35
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,516
Wonderful!
Then I'm sure you won't mind...

36
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:51,559
Being their legal guardians for a month.

37
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:57,235
Well, well, if it isn't my old friends,
Stretch Pants, No Pants...

38
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,709
And Idiot.

39
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:03,953
We're making beer. I'm the brewery.
I heard alcohol makes you stupid.

40
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:07,550
No, I'm... Doesn't.
Actually, Dwight, you're right.

41
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:12,635
Alcohol is very, very bad. For children.
But once you turn 21...

42
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,837
It becomes very, very good.
So scram.

43
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,798
Oh, man.
I'm sick of this.

44
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:22,909
Hey, Dad. What useless contraption
are you half-Baking today?

45
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:26,629
You what?
Oh, this is my latest invention.

46
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:30,713
A device that lets anyone
sound exactly like me.

47
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:33,832
Good news, everyone.
I'm a horse's butt.

48
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:36,713
I am? That's not good
news at all, you little...

49
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,912
What's this device's marketability?
Who's the target consumer?

50
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,112
There is no target consumer.
Only targets.

51
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:48,512
Targets that will tremble in fear
as their new masters hand down edicts

52
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:51,148
In my glorious, booming voice!

53
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:55,155
Now quit pestering me,
you confounded scoundrels!

54
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,513
Can I collate that?
No.

55
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:05,036
Can I shred these contracts?
No!

56
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:07,629
Wow! A power stamper.

57
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:13,992
Now look at all the work I gotta do!

58
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:25,954
The ingredients are cooked.

59
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,549
They picked up some of your
natural robot flavorings.

60
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,199
Time to add the yeast.

61
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:35,317
Yeast? You mean I'll have a
life form growing inside me?

62
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:38,552
It's so beautiful.

63
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:44,114
<i>Talk to me.
This is Professor Farnsworth.</i>

64
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:47,431
<i>I have an important delivery
for you and your dumb crew.</i>

65
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,319
<i>You must deliver a pizza to Dog Doo 8...</i>

66
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:53,153
<i>A planet at the edge of the universe.</i>

67
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:57,797
Sorry I can't come to say goodbye,
but I'm busy inventing useless junk.

68
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:01,111
And I smell bad.

69
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:23,718
If you were my kids, you'd get
quite a talking to. From your father.

70
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:25,711
When he got home from the Senate.

71
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,638
Oh, bother.
What have they done now?

72
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:30,633
Those pork dumplings sent
us on a fake pizza delivery.

73
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,313
The address was on Dog Doo 8.

74
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:35,153
But the universe ends
right after Dog Doo 7.

75
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:38,716
Child-Man, is this true?
Yeah. But why are you mad at us?

76
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:42,350
Your dummy brigade wasted a week
on an obviously fake mission.

77
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:45,711
Plus, they're making bootleg
beer inside company property.

78
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:48,912
Lies! Lies and slander!

79
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:53,392
Accusing gentle Bender of a misdeed?
That's the last straw!

80
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,511
You boys have been
underfoot long enough.

81
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,836
You jerked the words
right out of my mouth.

82
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,037
We're their fathers,
and it's high times we acted like it.

83
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,713
Here comes violence.

84
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:06,157
Get a job, you lazy kids.

85
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:12,314
I guess if you want children beaten,
you have to do it yourself.

86
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,758
Come on, Dad. Shuffle faster!

87
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:19,275
You don't wanna miss the
unveiling of our company.

88
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,590
Company?

89
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:27,551
Cute. What'll you peddle? Lemonade?
Shoeshines? Cootie insurance?

90
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:32,157
Perhaps they've constructed
a teddy bear hospital.

91
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:35,797
Actually, we're starting a
competing delivery company.

92
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:44,076
Welcome to the world of business.

93
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:54,876
Who's going to use a delivery
service with a kicked sign?

94
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:58,072
Nobody, that's who.
We already have a client signed up.

95
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,959
<i>We're delivering the Daily Supernova.</i>

96
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:06,355
So your delivery company is just
a cute, harmless paper route.

97
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,551
No. It's a serious business.

98
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:13,151
Yes. It's a tremendous
responsibility, all right.

99
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,920
What if a paper were
to land in a puddle?

100
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,958
Civilization as we know
it might get splashed.

101
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:32,476
Why do they always
treat us like dumb kids?

102
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:35,837
We're practically old enough to
find the Fox Network infantile.

103
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,389
We'll show them.
All Awesome Express needs...

104
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:41,074
Is a sturdy interstellar delivery craft.

105
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,079
Voil?!

106
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:45,800
You got a quarter?

107
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:54,995
Man! The ad said to allow four
to six seconds for delivery.

108
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:57,390
More like seven.

109
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:03,356
I'm really starting to swell up
with beer. I must look ridiculous.

110
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:05,391
No. You have a healthy glow.

111
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:10,112
Oh, my God! I just felt it ferment.
Let me feel.

112
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:12,197
Have you thought about a name?

113
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,630
I was thinking Benderbrau
if it's an ale...

114
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,631
Botwiser if it's a lager.

115
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,030
I hope it's a lager.
I can take it to a ball game.

116
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,599
I felt that one!

117
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,476
There's a crack in the hull here.

118
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:31,915
That could cause
explosive decompression.

119
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,275
Put a sticker on it.

120
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:40,519
Off on your first delivery?
You be careful, my little tinkler.

121
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:44,070
Remember we used to call
you that, huh? Tinkler.

122
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:49,714
Gets moving. Those newspapers
won't deliver themselves.

123
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:52,070
Only the Sunday edition can do's that.

124
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:56,755
Goodness, there must be
50 papers in that bundle.

125
00:08:56,960 --> 00:09:00,157
That's a big number, 50.
Yeah. If you're an idiot.

126
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:06,915
Three, two, one.
All systems go.

127
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,429
Blastoff!

128
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:18,470
See you at din-Din.
I'm blowing you a kiss.

129
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:21,358
Take evasive action!

130
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:26,759
It's closing in. You can't avoid it.
It's a cheek-Seeker.

131
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:29,150
And...
Got you!

132
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:31,117
No!

133
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:33,198
Business is down, so I filed papers
to have you all reclassified as slaves.

134
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:39,791
Well, well, if it isn't
our little munchkin moguls.

135
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:44,597
What's the trouble, men?
Need some penny rolls for your profits?

136
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:47,360
Actually, thanks to Dwight's
brilliant accounting...

137
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:50,080
And my unaccountable brilliance...

138
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:53,198
Our paper route now has
over a million customers!

139
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,390
We're finally making
more money than you guys.

140
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:59,836
Aren't you impressed now, Pops?
Aren't you? Aren't you?

141
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,956
In a small way, yes.

142
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:05,197
You still don't have your own
building or conference table...

143
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,918
Or one of those things.

144
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,479
Hello.

145
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:12,877
Our dads are never impressed,
no matter what we do.

146
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,837
Maybe we should start a fire.

147
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:18,794
If we really want to impress them,
we'll have to crush them with strategy.

148
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,439
Dwight Lightning.

149
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:25,395
Very well.
But I get to name the next strategy.

150
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:28,868
<i>This week on The Real World The Sun:</i>

151
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,515
<i>I'm burning to death!</i>

152
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:36,514
You know how much an apartment
that big would cost on the sun?

153
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:40,150
People! As you know, our young
sons have become great successes...

154
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,072
In the very same field as us.

155
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,753
Oh, that's great!
That's good.

156
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:45,359
Naturally, we're humiliated.

157
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:47,750
That's why we need you,
our loyal crew...

158
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:51,515
To make Planet Express
800% more profitable.

159
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:55,309
We'll start by slashing salaries.
And this time, I mean really slashing.

160
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:57,750
Guys? I don't know
how to tell you this...

161
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:00,309
So I'll just let Fry
blurt it out thoughtlessly.

162
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:01,953
We don't work for you anymore!

163
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,116
What?
Dwight and Cubert made us an offer.

164
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:06,236
We're paperboys now.
Incoming!

165
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:09,039
We've got papers to stuff, team.
Hut-Two. Hut-Two.

166
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:11,708
Yes, sir.
We're on it, Mr. Farnsworth.

167
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,395
Folks? The situation is grim.

168
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:25,192
But we shall prevail, thanks to you,
our crack team of loyal dregs.

169
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,470
I don't even know who this guy is.
I'm Scruffy, the janitor.

170
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:34,717
Of course you are.
Now, we've got to buckle down...

171
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,677
And save Planet Express.

172
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,677
I'm on break.

173
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:50,550
Sorry to interrupt this whirlwind of
activity, but we have an announcement.

174
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:54,594
I direct your attention to the forms
which I'm presently engaged in handing you.

175
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:58,071
Sweet guinea pig of Winnipeg!
They've taken over our company.

176
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,879
Balderdash! I never agreed to that.

177
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:04,550
No. But you did declare yourself
dead three years ago as a tax dodge.

178
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:07,911
Tax dodge, nothing! You take
one nap in a ditch at the park...

179
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:10,355
And they start declaring
you this and that.

180
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:13,757
Either way, I technically inherit
your building and your spaceship.

181
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,753
Which means Planet Express is now...

182
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:18,911
Awesome Express.

183
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:22,316
You rotten kids!

184
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,038
Will you be hiring?
No.

185
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,151
You rotten kids!

186
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:39,591
There. One million papers,
folded and loaded.

187
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:44,633
Leela, help me apply these
flame decals I got in my cereal.

188
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,518
They'll make the ship go faster.

189
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:49,029
And what's your scientific
basis for thinking that?

190
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:50,229
I'm 12.

191
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:59,076
Did I ever tell you how
I used to own that ship?

192
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:06,313
There but for the grace of God.

193
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,990
Oh, my God! I think it's time!

194
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:20,430
Hurry, Leela!
Get some coasters and cold mugs.

195
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,392
Push, Bender! Push!

196
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:27,958
You're doing great.

197
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:31,396
Oh, it feels like it's trying
to push a waterbed out of me.

198
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,034
Almost there. Just two more bottles.

199
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:38,313
Is it okay? I can't hear anything.

200
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:41,836
It's an ale. Five gallons, six ounces.

201
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:48,994
Hey, what's going on?

202
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:51,475
This is a delivery company,
not a delivery room.

203
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:54,279
We busted our buns
delivering a million papers...

204
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:58,228
And this is how you greet us?
With a bunch of frosty cold beers?

205
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:02,274
Hey, wait a second. How did you
deliver a million papers in one hour?

206
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:05,509
We just did, okay?
'Cause we're awesome.

207
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:09,116
Yeah. Awesome.
Yeah. Awesome.

208
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:12,159
Hello, Awesome Express, the rude,
crude delivery dudes.

209
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:15,073
How may I direct your call?
What's that?

210
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:20,394
You haven't gotten your paper?
In how long?

211
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:31,429
Might a homeless old man have
a touch more beef bourguignon...

212
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,716
And another tequila slammer?

213
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,996
Please?
Don't you sweet-Talk me...

214
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:41,233
You wrinkly old tube sock.
May I have one too, wife?

215
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,318
You're both pathetic,
being jealous of your own offspring.

216
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:47,074
Now, you should be happy
that they became successes...

217
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:49,390
Instead of following
in your food stamps.

218
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:52,831
Oh, it's true.
But they grow up so fast.

219
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,468
We wanted a few more years
of being better than them.

220
00:15:55,640 --> 00:16:01,078
They're so stinking talented,
they don't even need their fathers anymore.

221
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:10,318
Dad! We screwed up.
You did? Tough luck, suckers.

222
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:14,832
Help us, Pops. We agreed to deliver
way more papers than we could handle.

223
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:18,510
We couldn't handle them. We dumped
the extras in a crater on the moon.

224
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:21,240
Now everybody's yelling at
us about their missing papers.

225
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:24,312
And we don't know what to do!

226
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:33,039
Why did you boys do all this?

227
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:37,109
We wanted you to be proud of us.
Proud of you?

228
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:39,919
You ruined us with sleazy
business practices...

229
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:42,640
And a complete disregard
for human decency.

230
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:45,593
Of course we're proud of you.
Damn right, we are!

231
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:51,039
Now, come on, let's go do a little
father-Son weaseling out of this.

232
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:58,875
Good thing I had this net
installed for catching giraffes.

233
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:20,108
Okay, boys. Let me show
you how a paper man does it.

234
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:30,352
<i>Au revoir!</i>

235
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,758
Can I use the gun, Dad?

236
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:37,117
What kind of father
would I be if I said no?

237
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:44,150
Only one house to go.
We did it!

238
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,874
Run away!
That bully, Brett Blob, lives there.

239
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:56,071
He's ugly, mean, stupid, stink mucus!

240
00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:00,518
And last week, we sort
of broke his window.

241
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:04,156
All right, all right. What do we
do when we break somebody's window?

242
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:06,510
Pay for it?
Oh, heavens, no!

243
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:09,956
We apologize with nice, cheap words.

244
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:17,638
I thought I heard the doorbell.
But I see it was the "dork bell."

245
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,872
You made a funny good one, Brett.

246
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:23,594
Now, now, no need to
give us the business.

247
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:28,390
We'd like a word with your daddy.
Whatever. Dad!

248
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:32,832
Don't worry, boys. I'm sure his father
is a perfectly normal, reasonable man.

249
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,115
What do you want?

250
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:38,598
Mr. Blob, our sons have come to
apologize for damaging your window.

251
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:41,957
They've learned their lesson,
and they want to make amends.

252
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:44,111
Sorry, sir.
Yeah, sorry.

253
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:48,598
You shove your apology into the bottom
of your one-Way digestive system.

254
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:52,395
Now, see here. We assured our sons
that you'd accept their apology.

255
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:58,155
Tell you what. I'll accept their
apology when they kiss my ass!

256
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:00,431
Which I don't have.

257
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:06,434
No one gives my boy that option.
Bring it on, Jell-O pop.

258
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:08,875
Yeah, get him, Dad.
Show him who's boss.

259
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:15,872
Get him, Pops.
Right.

260
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,593
That was incredible!

261
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:32,832
You are the bravest dads
in the entire trauma center.

262
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:35,076
You guys almost had him,
until he digested you.

263
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,748
Oh, you're good kids.

264
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:41,469
If I could feel anything
right now, it would be pride.

265
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:45,918
I was wrong! I can still feel pain!

266
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:52,154
He's come to finish the job.
Someone toss me out the window!

267
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:56,399
No, no wait. I feel terrible
about what happened.

268
00:19:56,560 --> 00:20:00,394
I've just been under a lot of stress
lately down at the plant, you know?

269
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:04,348
They're bringing in computers
to improve productivity...

270
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:08,069
And, well, that's no
excuse for how I acted.

271
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:12,631
But the boy needs to see that real men
solve their disagreements with words...

272
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:15,912
Not violence.
So if you'll accept my apology...

273
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:20,039
Well, I hope we can put this
embarrassing incident behind us.

274
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:22,918
I suppose.

275
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:26,750
Hey, chumps. I heard you were
on the ass end of an ass-Kicking.

276
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:29,235
I figured you could use a few of these.

277
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:33,149
Why not? Might as well live it up
as long as I got this catheter in me.

278
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:35,476
Won't you join us, Mr. Blob?

279
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:37,830
Sounds like a plan.

280
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:40,151
This is what makes
life worth clinging to.

281
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:43,756
Three fathers enjoying a
day out with their sons.

282
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:47,632
It would seem we've taught
our boys a lesson about life.

283
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:52,396
Man or blob, it's what's
inside that counts.
