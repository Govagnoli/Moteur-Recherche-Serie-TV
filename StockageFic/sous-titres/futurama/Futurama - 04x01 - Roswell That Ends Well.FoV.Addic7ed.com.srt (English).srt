00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:09,396
Futurama [4x01] - Roswell That Ends Well - CiWaN

2
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:47,477
I've never seen a supernova blow up...

3
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:50,871
But if it's like my Chevy Nova,
it'll light up the sky.

4
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:54,715
Anyone who misses this
will regret it forever.

5
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,669
Fry, could you go make some popcorn?
Okay.

6
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:06,471
Let's go, microwave.
I'm in a hurry here.

7
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:21,793
What smells like blue?
Fry, get up here. It's starting.

8
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:24,190
Focus.

9
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:38,078
Oh.
Oh, boy.

10
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,116
Oh, no.

11
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,119
Uh-Oh.

12
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:50,279
Which crazy thing happening
are you guys screaming about?

13
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,633
My head is spinning.

14
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:26,995
My popcorn's done.

15
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,596
It's less popped than ever.

16
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:35,351
I don't know what happened,
but we've taken on clocks. Let's go home.

17
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,435
Why is there so little traffic?

18
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:44,195
What's this layer of ozone?
That's never been there before.

19
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:47,994
Such noises.

20
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:52,113
There's no global-Positioning signal.
Navigation is failing.

21
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:54,510
We're gonna crash!
Not if I can help it.

22
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:59,355
I guess I can't.
Everyone put on your seat belts.

23
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:03,354
Those cost more lives than they save.

24
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:18,873
Bender, are you okay?
Don't know. I'll try to move my feet.

25
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:27,789
Here's the plan. Zoidberg, pick up
the pieces. Everyone else, take five.

26
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:43,592
Zoidberg picks up another piece.
The crowd goes wild.

27
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,999
What is...?

28
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:57,558
In all my years of covering
top-Secret discoveries with sheets...

29
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:03,392
I've never dramatically revealed
anything this shocking. Dun-Dun-Dun!

30
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:06,632
The debris from an alien spaceship.

31
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,197
Son, I think I can safely say:
Ahhh!

32
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:16,558
As you can see, 1947 is going
to be an eventful year...

33
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:20,793
For the town of Roswell, New Mexico.

34
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:33,915
Remarkable.

35
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:39,439
According to the precision digital
chronograph, it's July 9th, 1947...

36
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:43,639
Which explains why the chronograph
turned into this calendar.

37
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:46,838
You mean we traveled through time?

38
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:50,470
Some idiot must have put
metal in the microwave.

39
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,995
Yo.
And the microwave radiation...

40
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:56,909
Combined with gravitons
and graviolies from the supernova

41
00:04:57,080 --> 00:05:01,278
Blasted us through time.
Seen today's news?

42
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:04,478
"Gym Renovations on Schedule"?
What a load.

43
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:08,395
No, over here.
"Flying Saucer Captured."

44
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:11,632
That's no flying saucer.
That's my ass.

45
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:16,795
My God. This means the flying saucer
that crashed in Roswell was us.

46
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:20,589
And the alien they
captured was... was...?

47
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,474
Hello.

48
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:24,669
Ugh.

49
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:28,879
What are you guys doing tonight?
I'm up for whatever.

50
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:37,790
We tore the universe a new space hole.
But it's clenching shut fast.

51
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,869
Our only hope to get back to our
time is to go back through within, say

52
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:46,590
Exactly 24 hours.

53
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:52,588
Ship's fixed except for the cup holder.
It should be operational in 10 hours.

54
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:56,190
You've got eight.
But more urgent is the microwave.

55
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:59,830
Without one, we have no hope
of returning to the future.

56
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,992
I'm sure we can buy one somewhere.

57
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:06,875
You sneak onto the Army base
and rescue Bender's body.

58
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:11,511
I'll visit my grandfather, Enus.
He was stationed at Roswell.

59
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:17,278
Stay away from him, dimwitted monkey!
You mustn't interfere with the past.

60
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:22,150
Don't do anything that affects anything,
unless you were supposed to

61
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:26,313
In which case, don't not do it.
Got it.

62
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:30,758
If you were to kill your grandfather,
you'd cease to exist.

63
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:34,117
But existing is basically all I do!

64
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:42,673
What is your purpose here?
All right, officer, I'll move along.

65
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:45,593
Why did you come to Earth?

66
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:49,150
Not a day goes by
I don't ask myself that.

67
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,989
Enus!

68
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:21,071
I want that toilet so clean I could
eat off it. Because I intend to.

69
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:25,472
Gadzooks, sarge.
It's my grandfather, Enus.

70
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:30,794
Now, prepare my lunch and place
it in the latrine at 1200 hours.

71
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:39,158
That jeep's gonna hit him,
and I won't exist anymore!

72
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:47,309
You almost got yourself run over.

73
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:52,111
Then I am lucky you knocked me
onto this pile of rusty bayonets.

74
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:57,673
Stop interfering with history. I don't
want to have to memorize new kings.

75
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:00,559
I had no choice.
I was about to not exist.

76
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:04,190
I could feel myself fading away,
like Greg Kinnear.

77
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:07,437
Thanks, soldier.
I'm off to make sarge's lunch.

78
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:13,232
Handling raw chicken? Best part
of the job. Finger-Licking good.

79
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:18,429
We gotta get you out of here.
Everything's gonna be all right, Dad.

80
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:23,196
Gadzooks, I'd better ask sarge.
No time. Run! Run to safety.

81
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:38,319
This experiment will determine
what food, if any, the alien eats.

82
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:47,599
A buffet. Oh, if only
I had my wallet with me.

83
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,639
Um, it's free.

84
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:02,317
Get me the president.

85
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:13,118
Fry's from this time. I'll talk like
him. Yo, Homes, we need a microwave.

86
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:17,399
Never heard of that brand.
What you want is the Gas Princess.

87
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:21,354
This has broilers,
casserole indicator, ironing board...

88
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:26,640
And a foot-Soaking tub, since, as a
woman, you'll be in front of it all day.

89
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:34,436
I'm sorry. Now, I'll ax you again.
Where can we find a microwave?

90
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:37,154
She's hysterical, so I'll talk to you.

91
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:40,636
This oven takes only five
hours to cook a roast.

92
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:46,193
That's good news. You know, you
really don't cook enough roasts, Leela.

93
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:49,069
Oh. Women.

94
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,640
Thank God I got you off that Army base.

95
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:02,398
You sure are helpful. You got
anything to eat in that lunch box?

96
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:05,996
What...?
Snacks.

97
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,595
Hey, that's my brain!

98
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:15,279
Them crackers cut my mouth up something
bad. Let's stop off for a malt.

99
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:25,910
See that waitress?
I know what I want for dessert.

100
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:30,597
That's my fianc? E, Mildred.
Grandma Mildred? No dessert.

101
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:33,234
Okey-Doke. And for you, snuggums?

102
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:37,678
I'll have a pie with a fried egg on top.

103
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:42,668
You ought to marry her and
father children right away.

104
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:45,195
Did you ever get the feeling...

105
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:49,393
You're only going with girls
because you're supposed to?

106
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:55,158
What?! Don't ever say or think that.
Just concentrate on staying alive.

107
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:58,239
Fire! Look out!

108
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:04,630
You almost got neutered.
Ain't as bad as killed.

109
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:08,156
For me it is.
I'm getting you out of here.

110
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:09,713
Ow!

111
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:21,990
We're in the middle of nowhere,
the safest part.

112
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:25,198
Just stay put and enjoy this calendar.

113
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:39,439
Safe and sound.
Finally, I can continue to exist.

114
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,794
Three, two, one.

115
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:08,672
And you are out of here.

116
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:18,677
What'll you folks have?
I'll have soylent green...

117
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:22,628
With a soylent orange
and soylent coleslaw.

118
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:25,394
Pardon?
It's the 20th century.

119
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:32,079
<i>I'll have a croque monsieur, paella,
two mutton pills and a stein of mead.</i>

120
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:37,110
I'll have an injection of Fem-A-Slim.
Two chili dogs coming up.

121
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:40,989
Settle in.
Without a microwave, we're trapped.

122
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:45,751
Oh, lord! We'll have to endure the
horrible music of the Big Bopper...

123
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:49,595
And then the terrible
tragedy of his death.

124
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:54,396
There's a microwave radar dish at
the Army base. We could steal it.

125
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:57,160
That would alter history.
Above all else...

126
00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:01,598
It is our sacred duty to preserve
the past exactly as it was.

127
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:04,035
Well, I killed my grandfather.
Wha...?

128
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:10,799
Wait, why do you still exist?
I don't know. Maybe God loves me.

129
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:15,639
Killed? In an atomic blast?

130
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:18,678
No, I don't take solace in the fact...

131
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:22,429
That the implosion trigger
functioned perfectly.

132
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:26,277
There, there.
If it makes you feel any better...

133
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:29,830
He was vaporized,
so he can't come back as a zombie.

134
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:33,868
I'm not worried about that.
Then you're braver than I.

135
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:37,876
You remind me of Enus.
Mind walking me home?

136
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:39,519
How far is it?

137
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:58,595
Welcome, President Truman.
This visit's top-Secret.

138
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,872
No one's to know,
except officers, scientists...

139
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:05,396
And a conspiracy nut
who no one will believe.

140
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:17,834
Our experts have reassembled
the parts from the alien ship...

141
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,877
Into its original design.

142
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:26,876
I want this sent to Area 51 for study.

143
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:29,918
Where we're building
the fake moon landing?

144
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:34,790
We'll have to really land on the
moon. Invent NASA and tell them.

145
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:39,989
If you come in peace, surrender.
If you're here to make war, we surrender.

146
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:43,670
The important thing is,
I'm meeting new people.

147
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:48,277
What's your mission? Are you
planning a kind of alien-Human hybrid?

148
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:52,035
Are you coming on to me?
I take exception to that.

149
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:55,317
I'm not hearing a no.
Nerts to this crab.

150
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:58,950
We'll have to do an
old-Fashioned alien autopsy.

151
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:01,712
Hooray!

152
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:11,270
Every little thing reminds me of Enus.

153
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:18,472
I know how you feel.
My grandfather died recently.

154
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:23,758
It's all so sad. At times like this...

155
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:26,309
I just need someone to hold me.

156
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:30,598
Mm. You like holding me, don't you?

157
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:34,389
Know what always cheers you up?
Baking me sugar cookies.

158
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,955
How about these cookies, sugar?

159
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:41,508
I shouldn't be here.
I shouldn't exist. But I do exist.

160
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:46,151
Which proves you can't
really be my grandma...

161
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:05,199
Ugh.
Oh, my God!

162
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:08,351
Wha...?

163
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:12,316
What the hell have you done?!

164
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:15,916
Relax. She can't be my grandmother.
I figured it out.

165
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:20,438
Of course she's your grandmother,
you perverted dope. Look.

166
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,318
Come back to bed, dearie.

167
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:27,839
Impossible. If she's my grandmother,
who's my grandfather?

168
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:30,913
Isn't it obvious?

169
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:32,798
You are.

170
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:41,590
Did you say something, dearie?
I'm a bit hard of hearing.

171
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:51,590
Commencing excavation of
subject's chest cavity.

172
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:55,475
And in this corner, Zoidberg.

173
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:59,599
Come on, lighten up.
What is this, a funeral?

174
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:03,113
Heart.
Take. I've got four of them.

175
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:07,990
Stomach contents. One deviled egg.
Deviled egg?

176
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:10,951
The same deviled egg.

177
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:17,594
Snap out of it!
Start the ship.

178
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:21,509
Let's steal the radar dish
and get back to our own time.

179
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,478
Won't that change history?

180
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:28,196
A lesson in not changing history
from Mr. I'm-My-Own-Grandpa.

181
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:31,870
Let's get the hell out of here.
Screw history.

182
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:55,275
UFO! UFO!

183
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:04,196
Don't cut that. I need that to speak.

184
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,319
Holy...
Great Roosevelt's ghost!

185
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:13,040
Hi-Ya! Ya!

186
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:14,958
Ya! Ya!

187
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:18,474
Take this, Mr. President. Sir.

188
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:21,757
Gah! Ah! Blecch!

189
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:26,670
The president is gagging on
my gas bladder. What an honor.

190
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:32,678
Wha...? Oh, right.

191
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:51,875
Enus!
He's dead. Sorry!

192
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:13,356
Yay!
Whoopee!

193
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:19,590
Choke on that, causality!
1947 can kiss my shiny metal... Ahh!

194
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:29,719
We've got to go back for Bender.
Impossible! The time hole is closing.

195
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:34,192
If we don't leave now, we'll never
get back to the 31 st century.

196
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,639
Whoa!

197
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,392
Bender!

198
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:59,072
There, good as new.
Don't you need this one?

199
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:02,835
Oh, no. That's my...

200
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:08,476
Gotcha.

201
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,676
Oh, poor Bender.

202
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:15,994
He must be so lonely right now,
trapped 1000 years in the past.

203
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,713
Hey, wait a second.

204
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:27,311
Anything?
No. Wait!

205
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:30,392
Oh! Stupid jerk.
He's alive.

206
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:33,279
Oh, ho!
Whee!

207
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:38,912
Bender! What was it like lying
in that hole for 1000 years?

208
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:44,029
I was enjoying it until you showed up.
Now everything is back as it was.

209
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:48,114
If history doesn't care that
our degenerate friend, Fry...

210
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:51,317
Is his own grandfather,
who are we to judge?

211
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:53,118
Amen.
