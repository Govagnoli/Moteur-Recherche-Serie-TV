Futurama [4x07] - A Pharaoh To Remember - CiWaN

2
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:35,953
<i>Up next, daring daylight robbery
at a municipal swimming pool.</i>

3
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:38,111
This is it! Turn me up!

4
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,834
<i>Today, a foul-Mouthed bandit
robbed the municipal pool...</i>

5
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,231
<i>Taking the contents
of over three lockers.</i>

6
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:48,675
More like three lockers and a sink.

7
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:52,276
You had something to do with this?
Of course not!

8
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:55,557
Holy Spitz!
He's sporting skintight Speedos.

9
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:59,713
They don't leave much to be imagined.
On a robot, they do.

10
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:01,871
<i>One human saw the robber...</i>

11
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:03,758
Here we go. Here we go.

12
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:06,559
<i>Describing him as a nasty, muscular...</i>

13
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,472
Make me famous, bighead!

14
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,312
<i>Caucasian human male.</i>

15
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:11,799
What?

16
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:15,918
What am I going to
watch and drink all day?

17
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,593
This is an outrage!

18
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:21,719
Why pull the biggest pool caper
if nobody knows you did it?

19
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:25,953
Well, there's the material rewards.
You mean this junk?

20
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:27,553
Whee!

21
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:31,912
All I ever wanted was for
people to remember my name.

22
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:33,149
It's Bender.

23
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:39,031
Why bother remembering anything?
You'll forget it five seconds later.

24
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,633
It's so unfair.

25
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:44,429
A debonair robot with a zesty,
in-Your-Face outlook...

26
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:49,230
Doomed to obscurity like the
rest of you, especially Leela.

27
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:53,869
If I died tomorrow,
no one would even notice.

28
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:02,554
Boy, I've never seen him
so down, or ever before.

29
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:06,192
How does a nobody like me get famous?

30
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,839
I know!

31
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:13,356
I'm stuck, but I haven't given up
hope! Call a soft-News journalist!

32
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:16,637
You're not stuck.
Shut up!

33
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:27,718
Hey, everybody, do The Bender!
This move's called The Bender!

34
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:31,919
This circle's about free
expression not fascist moves!

35
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:41,553
A blank wall! Fame is mine!

36
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:01,995
No one will forget how I live
or my attitude regarding butt.

37
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:08,639
All right, ladies. Let's flush
these artist lofts straight to hell!

38
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,195
No!

39
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:31,669
I'm the first one to work. A new low.

40
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,114
Surprise!

41
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,872
Happy funeral, Bender!

42
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,709
A surprise funeral, for me?

43
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:40,678
To show you that you'll be remembered.

44
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:45,038
Now, if the deceased will
kindly take his place of honor.

45
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:48,115
Cushiony! And a minibar!

46
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:58,031
Dearly beloved, we are
here to remember Bender...

47
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:03,877
Crushed by a runaway semi
driven by the Incredible Hulk.

48
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:06,759
Aw, you knew my favorite cause of death.

49
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:10,799
Let's remember the best things
about Bender, in our own way.

50
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,279
Professor?

51
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:20,037
Your standard bending unit is
made of an iron-Osmium alloy.

52
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:25,399
But Bender was different.
Bender had a .04-Percent nickel impurity.

53
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,912
It's what made me me!

54
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:33,476
If you needed a package brought
into the country without x-Raying...

55
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:36,279
Bender always had a free body cavity.

56
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:40,353
The professor's was better.
You're supposed to be dead.

57
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:43,318
Say how great I am.
And where's the crying?

58
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:46,631
You people look like
you're waiting for the bus.

59
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:50,348
<i>Oh, Danny-Boy...</i>

60
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:54,957
<i>The pipes, the pipes are calling...</i>

61
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,269
Who-Y-Boy?

62
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:59,876
<i>From glen to glen...
And down...</i>

63
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:05,068
You're at my funeral, singing about
some dead stiff named Danny-Boy?

64
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:07,595
You really are a massive bonehead!

65
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:09,990
I'm expressing sorrow.
Get lost!

66
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:13,675
I'd say, "Don't quit your day job,"
but you're bad at it too!

67
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:16,752
We're trying our best.
Your best is an idiot.

68
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:20,469
Pick it up, people.
So far, it's been crap after crap.

69
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:23,791
I croaked. Now, show me some love.

70
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:30,030
Bender was a truly special...
Louder and sadder!

71
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:33,476
Bender was a truly special...
Next!

72
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:38,115
Dear Lord...
Oh, next!

73
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:42,353
<i>Oh, Danny-Boy</i>

74
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:46,908
Surely there's someone here
who knows how great I was.

75
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:49,231
Yes, there is, Bender.

76
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:52,756
Bender was a lot of
things to a lot of people.

77
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:57,038
Looking back, the number-One
thing I can say about him is this:

78
00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:00,039
Bender was my friend.

79
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,191
What?! That's it?

80
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:06,638
Who are you? You're nobody!
This is the worst funeral ever!

81
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:12,517
I hope you're happy!
You've convinced me life is worth living...

82
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:16,912
By showing how bad my funeral will suck!

83
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:20,794
I know whose funeral we'll attend next.

84
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,678
Oh, stop.

85
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,953
News, everyone!

86
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:34,353
Today you're going to O'Cyris Four to
deliver this enormous sandstone block.

87
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:37,717
I thought something
looked different in here.

88
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:54,839
Hi. We have a giant stone to deliver.
Sign here.

89
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:00,590
Nice! Much like the 10
million identical stones...

90
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:05,231
Already used in the future tomb
of our great Pharaoh Hermenthotip.

91
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,277
Impressive. Who'll build it?

92
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,634
You.
Say again?

93
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:13,430
You are now slaves of the great
Pharaoh Hermenthotip. Guards!

94
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:20,109
Call it a hunch, but I've
got a bad feeling about this.

95
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:36,912
The bad thing about being a slave is,
they don't pay you or let you go.

96
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:39,435
That's the only thing
about being a slave.

97
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:43,832
Attention! You are now possessions
of Pharaoh Hermenthotip...

98
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,913
Bringer of the good aspects
of the annual floods!

99
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:51,197
This place is like the
ancient Egypt of my day!

100
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,078
That is no coincidence.

101
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:56,676
Our people visited your
Egypt thousands of years ago.

102
00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:00,469
Insane theories: One.
Regular theories: A billion!

103
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:05,236
We learned much from the Egyptians.
Pyramid building, space travel...

104
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:10,195
And how to prepare our dead so
as to scare Abbott and Costello.

105
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:13,075
Also Wolfman.

106
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:18,315
Look at these swanky tombs!
These people know how to die.

107
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:22,996
They worked thousands of people to
death making these stupid monuments!

108
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:27,312
Spend your whole life building
a guy's toe, you'll remember him.

109
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:32,074
I think I'm gonna like it here.

110
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:36,472
I noticed your sign.
I thought I'd look into your program.

111
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:38,238
We make you starve to death.

112
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:45,954
One, two, three, pull!
One, two, three, pull!

113
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,758
Aw, bloody chunder!

114
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:50,798
Pick it up, people!
We're enslaved to do a job!

115
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:53,394
Master, do we have to count to three?

116
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:56,074
Couldn't we count to one?
Or one-Half?

117
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:59,755
Good idea, slave. One-Half, pull!
One-Half, pull!

118
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,148
Now we're slaving!

119
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:17,795
Pharaoh's counting on us!
Work faster! Like this:

120
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:25,119
That's motivating me?

121
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:29,796
Don't whip with your arms. The power
comes from your hips. Like this:

122
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,480
Quit giving the slave drivers pointers!

123
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:38,679
Remember who your friends are!
I'll tell you who I remember!

124
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:42,793
Enoughsis! Pullutut! What's-His-Name!

125
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:46,396
He was the greatest of all.

126
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:50,829
Pharaoh Hermenthotip approaches!

127
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:07,595
Hurry! Pharaoh's coming!
Get that nose in place! Come on!

128
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:30,548
Excellent work!
I'm very proud of all you slaves!

129
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,353
<i>Viva Hermenthotip!</i>

130
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:37,034
And now, I have a grand announcement.

131
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:40,510
In honor of your achievement,
you're all hereby...

132
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,759
No!

133
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:52,069
Tell the slaves they can all go...

134
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:55,038
Go faster? I told them,
but they're lazy.

135
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,998
No. I mean, they're all free.

136
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:02,039
Freeloading off you? I agree.
No, I...

137
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:09,195
Pharaoh Hermenthotip is dead.

138
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,834
He's whipping angels now.

139
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:26,310
We commend the body of Hermenthotip
to the abode of the damned.

140
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,596
The damned good-Looking.

141
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:32,309
Pharaoh commanded me to tell
that joke at his funeral.

142
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:38,476
I'll always remember you, Hermenthotip.

143
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:43,270
To equip Pharaoh for his journey,
we bury him with his favorite things.

144
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,476
Such as his heart and liver.

145
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:51,552
And the many goods he
left in his royal garage.

146
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:58,592
Also this bag of cats our
culture considers holy.

147
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:07,400
<i>Pharaoh, my god-King,
You are cold and deceased...</i>

148
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:10,950
<i>I used to have him sing...</i>

149
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,793
<i>P- P-P-Pharaoh and his pets...</i>

150
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:19,872
<i>But the years went by...
And Pharaoh died...</i>

151
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:23,350
<i>Susie will have joined
him in the afterlife...</i>

152
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:30,958
Hermenthotip is gone. The time to
designate a new Pharaoh is at hand.

153
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:33,349
Wow!

154
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:37,638
At dawn, the high priest will
consult the Wall of Prophecy...

155
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:40,439
To determine Hermenthotip's successor.

156
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:47,109
That ends the funeral. You don't have
to go home, but you can't stay here.

157
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:52,430
Can you believe it?
Pharaoh's dead!

158
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:56,991
Yes! Tonight we are slaves to no one!
Except the rhythm.

159
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:00,195
Yeah! Play those bongos!

160
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:03,193
I'm gonna spin till I fall down!

161
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:25,519
We interrupt this ancient prophecy
to bring you a late-Breaking bulletin.

162
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:37,032
Great Wall of Prophecy! Reveal to us
God's will that we may blindly obey!

163
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:40,112
Free us from thought and responsibility!

164
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:43,556
We shall read things off you!
Then do them!

165
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:46,632
Your words guide us!
We're dumb!

166
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:50,634
You know what else stinks
about being a slave? The hours.

167
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:54,833
The prophecy is strange
and crudely drawn at best.

168
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,958
It indicates that we are here...

169
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:02,796
And our next Pharaoh is
over there, near some tents.

170
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:07,431
Those are waves, jackass!
It's supposed to be a river!

171
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:11,277
I know who the next Pharaoh is!
Oh, lord.

172
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:16,594
We hear your voice, great Pharaoh!
Reveal yourself to us!

173
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:22,039
Behold! I have emerged from
the place of spells and fairies!

174
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:27,716
It is he, just as the Wall
of Prophecy prophesied!

175
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,468
Long live Pharaoh Bender!

176
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:36,316
Long live Pharaoh Bender!
This society is a bunch of idiots.

177
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,838
People of O'Cyris Four!

178
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:47,836
Welcome a man who started as a slave,
but worked up to lord of all creation!

179
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,515
Our new Pharaoh, Bender!

180
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:05,518
Citizens of me! The cruelty of the
old Pharaoh is a thing of the past!

181
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:12,315
Let a whole new wave of cruelty
wash over this lazy land!

182
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:15,153
What did he say?

183
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:20,440
Hear the word of Pharaoh! Build unto
me a statue of ridiculous proportion!

184
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:22,909
One billion cubits in height...

185
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:26,795
That I might be remembered
for all eternity!

186
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,439
And be quick about it.

187
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:39,435
Lowly slave! Why are you not working?
I am!

188
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,875
I meant, "Yourself to death?"

189
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:44,315
Pharaoh, it hurts when I breathe.

190
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:47,790
Well then, what do you
think you should stop doing?

191
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:49,837
Crawl, pigs!

192
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:53,513
The Pharaoh has spoken!

193
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:25,988
Your task is nearly completed.
Don't let down Pharaoh now!

194
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:37,670
The great monument is finished,
oh, Pharaoh! And now the unveiling!

195
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:43,154
<i>Remember me!</i>

196
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:46,039
<i>Remember me!</i>

197
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:48,111
<i>Remember me!</i>

198
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:50,714
Does it please you, my lord?

199
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:53,236
It's a good start.

200
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:59,076
Yeah, it's definitely big.
I just wonder if it's too big, you know?

201
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:02,710
Are people gonna be
remembering me or the statue?

202
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:05,713
We made it to your exact specifications.

203
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07,791
Too exact, if you ask me.

204
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:13,193
Tear it down and try again! But this
time, don't embarrass yourselves!

205
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:23,071
Ladies and gentlemen,
the Pharaoh suddenly died.

206
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:32,231
Good riddance.
What about my servants?

207
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:34,158
Oh, yeah.
Right.

208
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:48,552
Bender, I really hope that's you,
because if it isn't...

209
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:50,354
We're in trouble.

210
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:53,353
You jerk! Why'd you
have to drag us along?

211
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:56,080
I wanted to watch you remember me.

212
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:02,351
You thought you'd need
this junk in the afterlife?

213
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:03,953
Afterlife?

214
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:07,590
If I had to go through another life,
I'd kill myself.

215
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:10,274
Rot in peace.
Fry and I are leaving.

216
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:12,715
Sorry, but we're totally sealed in.

217
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:16,793
Nothing can get in or out
except millions of snakes.

218
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:20,672
Have a pomegranate schnapps
from my distillery...

219
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:24,389
And start sharing fond
memories of me, Bender.

220
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:27,597
What proof is this? Some huge number?

221
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:30,629
It's explosive!

222
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:35,032
We could ignite the distillery
and blow this place to rubble!

223
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:40,358
Let's get a little kindling going.

224
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:46,516
You can't blow up my monument!
I won't be remembered!

225
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:51,151
Oh, right. How selfish of me.
We'll just stay here forever.

226
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:55,154
Hey, Fry? Remember that robot, Bender?

227
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:57,709
Bender? Doesn't ring a bell.

228
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:00,754
Did you hear something?
No.

229
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:03,559
I bet it wasn't someone
good at stealing.

230
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:06,837
Stop it! It's not right!
You've crossed a line!

231
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,798
You know who I remember?
Let it be me.

232
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:13,032
That guy who used to bend things.
Me? Please?

233
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,839
Hermes!
All right, all right!

234
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,629
If it means that much to you,
blow up my statue.

235
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:23,873
Oh, Bender! When did you come in?
Hold still.

236
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:35,030
Let's blow this tomb.

237
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:48,550
Pharaoh Bender!
He once more walks among the living!

238
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,153
How we doing?

239
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:04,075
<i>Remember me!</i>

240
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:07,349
I will. I will.

241
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:20,635
Please just leave me alone.

242
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:26,838
I understand your desire
to be remembered...

243
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,958
But you don't need a statue for that.

244
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:31,792
I don't?
No.

245
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:35,589
You have your legacy as a brutal,
tyrannical dictator...

246
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:38,354
And that will outlive any monument.

247
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:41,557
You think they'll remember me?
Absolutely.

248
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:45,395
Well, in that case, one planet down.

249
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:49,314
Helmsmen, set course for Earth!

250
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:57,239
That's not Earth.
Oh.
