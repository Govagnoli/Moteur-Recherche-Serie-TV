00:00:07,413 --> 00:00:09,483
Futurama [5x11] - Three Hundred Big Boys - CiWaN

2
00:00:30,813 --> 00:00:33,611
This Week in the Universe.

3
00:00:34,373 --> 00:00:36,125
Dateline, Tarantulon 6.

4
00:00:36,293 --> 00:00:37,567
The brave warriors of Earth...

5
00:00:37,733 --> 00:00:40,964
Under the command of Gen. Maj.
Webelo Zapp Brannigan...

6
00:00:41,133 --> 00:00:45,684
Have achieved victory
over the spider homeworld.

7
00:00:48,293 --> 00:00:50,602
And to the victor belong the spoils.

8
00:00:50,773 --> 00:00:55,085
One trillion dollars in silken treasure.

9
00:00:56,813 --> 00:01:00,567
My fellow Earthicans, after meeting
with top voodoo economists...

10
00:01:00,733 --> 00:01:04,726
I have decided to refund
our silk surplus to you, the taxpayers.

11
00:01:04,893 --> 00:01:08,442
That's right, I've sent
you each 300 buckaroos...

12
00:01:08,613 --> 00:01:12,686
In the form of a Tricky Dick Fun Bill.
Knock yourselves out!

13
00:01:15,213 --> 00:01:16,566
I'm slightly richer!

14
00:01:16,773 --> 00:01:18,286
What to do, what to do?

15
00:01:18,493 --> 00:01:22,042
One $300 hooker-Bot
or 300 $1 hooker-Bots?

16
00:01:22,253 --> 00:01:23,527
I'm gonna swim with a whale.

17
00:01:23,693 --> 00:01:27,242
They're the gentle giants of the deep.
I'm well aware of that.

18
00:01:27,453 --> 00:01:30,525
Scruffy's gonna get himself
one of them $300 haircuts.

19
00:01:30,693 --> 00:01:33,526
This one's lost its pizzazz.

20
00:01:33,733 --> 00:01:35,007
A fortune, it is.

21
00:01:35,173 --> 00:01:38,768
At last, Zoidberg will
live like a rich man!

22
00:01:39,013 --> 00:01:41,447
Hey, cut it out. Go away.
Get away from me.

23
00:01:41,693 --> 00:01:45,891
It's just 300 bucks.
What is that, like 100 cups of coffee?

24
00:01:46,093 --> 00:01:49,927
That's it! I'm getting 100
cups of coffee, starting now.

25
00:01:50,173 --> 00:01:52,368
Coffee machine,
one cup of coffee, please.

26
00:01:57,053 --> 00:01:59,328
Smells good.

27
00:02:01,253 --> 00:02:03,642
Leela, are you there?
No.

28
00:02:03,853 --> 00:02:07,323
Oh, yes, you are. I'm hereby inviting
you and your oddball coworkers...

29
00:02:07,493 --> 00:02:11,611
To a special reception to
display the national silk surplus.

30
00:02:11,773 --> 00:02:14,970
I believe you know the heroic
space stallion who captured it.

31
00:02:15,133 --> 00:02:17,203
Show them my medal, Kif.

32
00:02:17,373 --> 00:02:19,523
He rented it with his tax refund.

33
00:02:19,693 --> 00:02:22,730
So, Leela, will you have the pleasure?

34
00:02:22,933 --> 00:02:24,730
What little there is to be had.

35
00:02:24,933 --> 00:02:28,562
Tomorrow night at 8, then.
Smooches.

36
00:02:34,013 --> 00:02:37,688
No cheap crack houses for me no more!

37
00:02:40,093 --> 00:02:43,130
Very good, sir.
Shall I pre-Warm sir's crack pipe?

38
00:02:49,493 --> 00:02:51,688
Oh, Kif, it was so romantic of you...

39
00:02:51,853 --> 00:02:54,162
To rent this paddle plane
with your tax rebate.

40
00:02:54,333 --> 00:02:57,131
We're like two dandelion
seeds wafting on the breeze.

41
00:02:57,293 --> 00:03:00,285
Yes. Seeds. Wafting.

42
00:03:00,493 --> 00:03:04,281
I almost feel kind of shallow for blowing
my rebate on this cool talking tattoo.

43
00:03:04,453 --> 00:03:07,809
Hey, Gordon Gekko. I cost as
much as this whole crummy date!

44
00:03:08,013 --> 00:03:09,969
Shut up! Ow!

45
00:03:13,893 --> 00:03:16,612
Ma'am, it has become too
much of a chore for me...

46
00:03:16,773 --> 00:03:18,764
To clean out my wrinkles each day.

47
00:03:18,973 --> 00:03:22,409
Is it true that stem cells
may fight the aging process?

48
00:03:22,613 --> 00:03:26,003
Well, yes. In the same way an
infant may fight Muhammad Ali, but--

49
00:03:26,213 --> 00:03:28,522
One pound of stem cells, please!

50
00:03:31,173 --> 00:03:35,644
Of course, any age-Reversing
effects will be purely temporary.

51
00:03:47,613 --> 00:03:49,444
Ooh!

52
00:03:51,853 --> 00:03:53,844
Oh!

53
00:03:54,053 --> 00:03:57,090
Say, buddy, why is this
Grand Cigar so pricey?

54
00:03:57,293 --> 00:03:58,567
Well, as you can see...

55
00:03:58,733 --> 00:04:02,043
Its wrapper is a piece of the
original U.S. Constitution.

56
00:04:02,213 --> 00:04:06,126
It was hand-Rolled by Queen
Elizabeth during her wild years...

57
00:04:06,293 --> 00:04:10,605
And was buried with George Burns
until grave-Robbing space mushrooms--

58
00:04:10,773 --> 00:04:12,286
Well, you know the rest.

59
00:04:12,493 --> 00:04:14,563
Give you 300 bucks for it.
No can do.

60
00:04:14,773 --> 00:04:19,722
Oh, all right. I'll just take
these $300 burglar's tools, then.

61
00:04:19,893 --> 00:04:21,804
Very good, sir.

62
00:04:21,973 --> 00:04:25,010
So, what time you close tonight?

63
00:04:27,093 --> 00:04:28,970
Hey, Pops! Did that tax rebate come?

64
00:04:29,173 --> 00:04:30,322
Came and went.

65
00:04:30,493 --> 00:04:33,690
You're now the proud owner
of Bamboo Boogie Boots!

66
00:04:34,853 --> 00:04:37,686
With a warning label this big,
you know they gotta be fun.

67
00:04:37,893 --> 00:04:39,565
But, Pops, I don't want to have fun.

68
00:04:39,733 --> 00:04:42,611
I want to be like you,
boring but prudently invested.

69
00:04:42,813 --> 00:04:44,087
Babylon's bells!

70
00:04:44,253 --> 00:04:47,165
I tallied almost 300 bananas
on this entertainment product!

71
00:04:47,333 --> 00:04:50,052
Now you put them on and have fun.
I don't wanna!

72
00:04:50,253 --> 00:04:53,962
Well, then, I'm gonna put them on
and make you watch me have fun! See?

73
00:04:54,173 --> 00:04:55,162
Fun, fun--

74
00:04:56,573 --> 00:05:00,851
Dwight! Help me!
I'll save you, Pops!

75
00:05:11,413 --> 00:05:14,405
Hey! Turn that damn music--

76
00:05:14,933 --> 00:05:17,163
Up.

77
00:05:17,373 --> 00:05:19,841
Isn't this fun?
No! I wish I had two mommies!

78
00:05:22,213 --> 00:05:25,569
Try these on, sir.

79
00:05:26,893 --> 00:05:30,966
I ask for rich-Guy stuff,
and you give me shiny pebbles?

80
00:05:31,173 --> 00:05:34,006
I bid you adieu.

81
00:05:34,653 --> 00:05:35,642
Ah!

82
00:05:43,773 --> 00:05:46,003
I'd like a pass to
swim with Mushu, please.

83
00:05:46,213 --> 00:05:48,852
Well, you asked the right guy.
I'm the whale biologist.

84
00:05:49,013 --> 00:05:52,369
Though, personally, I hate whales.
Especially Mushu.

85
00:05:52,573 --> 00:05:54,484
Then why'd you become a whale biologist?

86
00:05:54,693 --> 00:05:57,765
I don't know you well enough
to get into that. $300, please.

87
00:05:59,493 --> 00:06:02,803
Noon tomorrow. If you're late,
you tread water in the scallop tank.

88
00:06:06,373 --> 00:06:07,852
Yeah. I'll have a coffee.

89
00:06:08,053 --> 00:06:11,682
Guppy, trout, mermaid or--?
Whale, please.

90
00:06:18,733 --> 00:06:24,922
Amy, I also spent some of my
tax rebate on a gift for you.

91
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:26,572
Oh, Kify!

92
00:06:27,933 --> 00:06:33,053
It shows the time wherever we
both are, and it's powered by love.

93
00:06:33,253 --> 00:06:34,652
Also, you have to wind it.

94
00:06:34,853 --> 00:06:38,482
Oh! Somebody won big at Skee-Ball!
You shut up!

95
00:06:38,653 --> 00:06:42,282
I love it, Kif. I'll use it whenever
I want to know what time it is.

96
00:06:44,493 --> 00:06:45,687
It's Fry and Leela.

97
00:06:46,013 --> 00:06:48,766
Hi, Fry and Leela!

98
00:06:49,493 --> 00:06:52,212
Keep peddling! Oh, for the
love of God, keep peddling!

99
00:07:01,613 --> 00:07:03,683
Bye, Fry and Leela!

100
00:07:06,413 --> 00:07:07,971
Oh.

101
00:07:12,973 --> 00:07:17,251
Oh! I can't wait till the tattoos
on Amy's butt hear about this!

102
00:07:17,413 --> 00:07:19,529
About what?
Tell us!

103
00:07:26,093 --> 00:07:29,210
Don't feel sad, my little tadpole.

104
00:07:29,373 --> 00:07:31,489
I'm trying not to...

105
00:07:31,653 --> 00:07:35,043
But my gift to you is
in the belly of a whale.

106
00:07:35,253 --> 00:07:39,326
Say, this reminds me of that time
I ate that other watch Kif gave you.

107
00:07:39,533 --> 00:07:42,252
Hey, it is kind of like that.
To induce vomiting.

108
00:07:42,413 --> 00:07:45,450
That was the solution.
Everywhere it went.

109
00:07:46,893 --> 00:07:49,532
What a Valentine's Day that was.

110
00:07:49,773 --> 00:07:52,890
Hmm. This may seem like
a huge coincidence...

111
00:07:53,053 --> 00:07:55,123
But I happen to have
an in with that whale.

112
00:07:55,333 --> 00:07:56,766
Scruffy's formulated a plan...

113
00:07:56,933 --> 00:08:00,084
But you'll need a ready source
of nauseating rotten fish.

114
00:08:02,653 --> 00:08:05,121
Freshen your coffee, sir?
Yeah. Keep it coming.

115
00:08:05,293 --> 00:08:06,692
Put the pot down. Get away!

116
00:08:11,973 --> 00:08:16,569
You're so young in spirit.
It's hard to believe you're as old as 25.

117
00:08:16,773 --> 00:08:22,450
The key is to grab life by the ho-Joes.
Live every day like it might be your last.

118
00:08:22,653 --> 00:08:26,612
What'll it be, kids?
One bowl of mild farina.

119
00:08:34,973 --> 00:08:36,292
Pay dirt.

120
00:08:43,053 --> 00:08:48,366
Here you go, big spender.
Foie gras and caviar.

121
00:08:48,533 --> 00:08:51,525
Goose liver? Fish eggs?

122
00:08:51,693 --> 00:08:54,082
Where's the goose? Where's the fish?

123
00:08:54,293 --> 00:08:57,444
Hey, that's what rich people eat.
The garbage parts of the food.

124
00:08:57,653 --> 00:09:01,123
I ate garbage yesterday,
and it didn't cost me $300!

125
00:09:01,293 --> 00:09:03,761
I'm not paying. Farewell, good sir.

126
00:09:29,453 --> 00:09:31,603
The Grand Cigar, she is mine.

127
00:09:31,773 --> 00:09:34,571
And with absolutely no consequences.

128
00:09:51,053 --> 00:09:53,408
You see that?
Grand-Theft tobacco.

129
00:09:53,573 --> 00:09:58,727
Time to get off our
fat cop asses and ride.

130
00:10:07,373 --> 00:10:12,811
Hey, you. This fish is slightly
too rotten to even make jambalaya.

131
00:10:17,253 --> 00:10:19,892
So far so good. Where's Kif?

132
00:10:27,773 --> 00:10:30,241
This isn't Yemeni! It's Sulawesi!

133
00:10:30,413 --> 00:10:32,722
The cup's shaking!
I don't want my coffee shaking!

134
00:10:32,933 --> 00:10:37,324
You seem a tad wound up, buddy.
And your face is greasy. Real greasy.

135
00:10:37,493 --> 00:10:39,848
Been up all night?
Of course I've been up all night!

136
00:10:40,013 --> 00:10:42,686
It was insomnia.
I couldn't stop thinking about coffee.

137
00:10:42,853 --> 00:10:44,206
I need a nap.

138
00:10:44,373 --> 00:10:46,648
Coffee time!

139
00:10:50,373 --> 00:10:52,682
Mighty fine smokable.
Fancy cigar.

140
00:10:52,853 --> 00:10:55,413
Why don't you smoke it already!
Puff, puff! Go, go, go!

141
00:10:55,573 --> 00:10:58,292
No. You can't blow the smoke
from such a majestic stogy...

142
00:10:58,453 --> 00:10:59,727
In just anyone's face.

143
00:10:59,933 --> 00:11:03,642
I'm saving it for the fancy-Pantses at
Zapp Brannigan's black-Tie reception.

144
00:11:03,813 --> 00:11:05,132
You coming?

145
00:11:09,893 --> 00:11:12,726
And the fifth reason whales
kill is for the sheer fun of it.

146
00:11:12,893 --> 00:11:15,771
Anything else?
You're lumpy and you smell awful.

147
00:11:16,253 --> 00:11:19,529
Hey, I calls them like I sees them.
I'm a whale biologist.

148
00:11:21,373 --> 00:11:24,968
Okay, Mushu, it's feeding time.

149
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:38,767
Oh, crud. He ate my suit.
It was ugly! Whale biologist.

150
00:11:46,813 --> 00:11:51,728
Perhaps if you tightened your grip, sir.
Thank you, golf slave.

151
00:11:53,093 --> 00:11:55,971
Rich people wouldn't waste
their time on this nonsense.

152
00:11:56,133 --> 00:11:59,091
Plus, these eggs are
gritty and tasteless.

153
00:12:04,253 --> 00:12:06,448
Ow! Not so rough!

154
00:12:10,693 --> 00:12:13,924
Ladies and gentlemen, presenting Mushu!

155
00:12:14,093 --> 00:12:17,005
The educated whale who
thinks he's better than you!

156
00:12:18,853 --> 00:12:22,892
Come on, Mushu! Barf!
Barf like a freshman!

157
00:12:23,093 --> 00:12:24,970
And now, ignorant whale lovers...

158
00:12:25,133 --> 00:12:28,523
We'll see who's boss as I make
Mushu jump through this hoop!

159
00:12:28,693 --> 00:12:29,967
Jump, Mushu.

160
00:12:34,813 --> 00:12:37,805
Who wants a fish?

161
00:12:43,333 --> 00:12:45,051
Mushu is sad!

162
00:12:45,253 --> 00:12:48,051
It just keeps coming and coming.

163
00:12:51,333 --> 00:12:54,769
Wait. That choke. It's the watch.

164
00:12:59,173 --> 00:13:00,811
I got it, Amy. I got it.

165
00:13:00,973 --> 00:13:04,522
The plan went off without a--
He's got aquarium property! Stop him!

166
00:13:04,733 --> 00:13:09,204
Better do what he says.
He's a whale biologist.

167
00:13:09,413 --> 00:13:11,722
You're under arrest, you squishy punk.

168
00:13:13,333 --> 00:13:14,527
Oh.

169
00:13:25,573 --> 00:13:26,926
Oh!

170
00:13:27,173 --> 00:13:30,324
The Spidarians, though weak and
womanlike on the battlefield...

171
00:13:30,493 --> 00:13:32,723
Are masters of the textile arts.

172
00:13:32,933 --> 00:13:34,605
Taste like king crab, by the way.

173
00:13:34,813 --> 00:13:38,852
Crazy bugs actually wove this
tapestry of my heroic conquest...

174
00:13:39,013 --> 00:13:41,322
While I was still killing them.

175
00:13:43,653 --> 00:13:46,292
What? It's not even scratch and sniff.

176
00:13:46,453 --> 00:13:50,810
But if rich people think it's good,
I'll buy it. One art, please!

177
00:13:53,053 --> 00:13:56,443
What a clever impersonation
of a stupid poor person.

178
00:13:56,613 --> 00:13:59,252
How much is that place mat
actually worth, Brannigan?

179
00:13:59,453 --> 00:14:05,801
Exactly $1 billion.
Now, that's walking-Around money.

180
00:14:07,013 --> 00:14:09,288
What? Hey!

181
00:14:23,053 --> 00:14:26,887
So I said to Kitty, "The only way to
keep the butler from running away...

182
00:14:27,053 --> 00:14:31,046
Is to cut off his foot. "
Ah. Uh-Huh. Uh-Huh.

183
00:14:31,213 --> 00:14:37,049
Yes, it reminds me of a joke I heard
about upper-Middle-Class people.

184
00:14:40,213 --> 00:14:42,886
I've never been sad at a party before.

185
00:14:43,053 --> 00:14:46,682
I wonder if my mind is thinking
about Kif being in jail?

186
00:14:46,893 --> 00:14:49,851
Jail's not so bad.
You can make sangria in the toilet.

187
00:14:50,013 --> 00:14:53,642
Of course, it's shank or be shanked.
Of course.

188
00:14:55,613 --> 00:14:59,128
Look, just give back our property,
and we'll drop the charges.

189
00:14:59,293 --> 00:15:02,012
Fine. Have the watch.
It's broken anyway.

190
00:15:03,933 --> 00:15:07,289
I don't want your watch.
You're covered in precious ambergris.

191
00:15:08,293 --> 00:15:09,806
Precious hamburgers?

192
00:15:12,173 --> 00:15:14,084
"Ambergris. " Noun.

193
00:15:14,293 --> 00:15:17,444
A greaselike product of the
sperm whale's digestive tract...

194
00:15:17,613 --> 00:15:20,173
That is used as a base
in the finest perfumes.

195
00:15:20,333 --> 00:15:25,202
This has been Roseanne,
your guide to the world of facts.

196
00:15:25,413 --> 00:15:29,167
You heard Roseanne. Scrape off the
priceless ambergris, and I'll let you go.

197
00:15:29,373 --> 00:15:33,889
Or better yet, I'll simply shed my skin.

198
00:15:39,613 --> 00:15:43,891
Stop it. Stop it. It's fine.
I will destroy you!

199
00:16:00,013 --> 00:16:02,481
Gotta go. Fight club.

200
00:16:06,773 --> 00:16:08,570
What's happening, Hubie?

201
00:16:08,773 --> 00:16:13,608
I'm afraid the face you fell in love with
was actually just a blob of living gunk...

202
00:16:13,773 --> 00:16:17,243
I bought with my tax refund.

203
00:16:19,573 --> 00:16:22,724
Well, as long as we're being honest...

204
00:16:22,893 --> 00:16:28,411
I also spent my tax refund
on a crazy treatment.

205
00:16:29,293 --> 00:16:31,204
That certainly is honest.

206
00:16:31,413 --> 00:16:34,530
It's better for us to
both just be ourselves.

207
00:16:34,733 --> 00:16:39,249
You, wrinkled as a prune.
You, fat as the queen of sea cows.

208
00:16:39,413 --> 00:16:42,371
I love you!

209
00:16:45,253 --> 00:16:46,242
Oh, my!

210
00:16:46,453 --> 00:16:48,648
So you see, the putrid,
waxy substance...

211
00:16:48,813 --> 00:16:51,532
I was coated with was--
Not precious ambergris?

212
00:16:51,733 --> 00:16:56,761
Yes! And I managed to sneak
some out in the usual place.

213
00:16:57,653 --> 00:17:02,886
Using that, I'll make you a perfume
of lilac and jasmine and frankenberry.

214
00:17:03,093 --> 00:17:06,130
Oh, Kif, it's so romantic,
I can't even wait!

215
00:17:06,293 --> 00:17:09,171
I'm gonna wear it right now.

216
00:17:14,853 --> 00:17:17,845
Who smells like freaking porpoise hork?
I do!

217
00:17:18,013 --> 00:17:20,481
Kiss me, Kif.

218
00:17:26,813 --> 00:17:29,452
Oh, what a foolish squid I've been.

219
00:17:29,613 --> 00:17:35,563
I'm not rich. I can't even
buy one measly masterpiece.

220
00:17:37,253 --> 00:17:39,847
Pardon us, gent. Might a couple
of hungry, hungry hoboes...

221
00:17:40,013 --> 00:17:43,528
Take a feed from that
aluminum snack box?

222
00:17:43,693 --> 00:17:48,483
Ah. So now I'm in the gutter,
surrounded by bums who eat garbage?

223
00:17:48,773 --> 00:17:51,924
Money brought me no happiness.
Bupkis.

224
00:17:52,133 --> 00:17:55,364
This boot's got a little
pudding at the bottom.

225
00:17:57,133 --> 00:18:00,569
Interestingly, the Spidarians are more
closely related to our elephants...

226
00:18:00,733 --> 00:18:03,293
Than our spiders.

227
00:18:08,613 --> 00:18:10,490
Don't mind us!

228
00:18:25,413 --> 00:18:28,371
The loot. The loot! The loot is on fire!

229
00:18:29,173 --> 00:18:32,563
Leela, my precious rock dove!
I'll save you!

230
00:18:34,613 --> 00:18:38,925
Everyone, to the fire door!
It's on fire!

231
00:18:39,133 --> 00:18:43,172
We're trapped, my sweet hippopotamus!

232
00:18:44,933 --> 00:18:47,891
Coffee, coffee, coffee!

233
00:19:42,773 --> 00:19:45,287
Where are we, Pops?
What happened to the food?

234
00:19:45,493 --> 00:19:48,530
I think we were saved by
a mysterious orange blur.

235
00:19:48,733 --> 00:19:54,171
Welcome, one and all! I finally figured
out how money could make me happy...

236
00:19:54,373 --> 00:19:56,967
By using it to buy my
hungry friends a feast!

237
00:19:57,173 --> 00:19:58,492
Hooray!

238
00:19:58,693 --> 00:20:03,847
Everyone join us. Oysters Rockefeller
here has provided genuine turkey dogs.

239
00:20:04,053 --> 00:20:07,284
Heck, you're never too rich
to enjoy a free turkey dog.

240
00:20:07,453 --> 00:20:09,284
Yeah!
All right! Turkey dog!

241
00:20:09,453 --> 00:20:10,727
I'll take four.
Me too.

242
00:20:10,893 --> 00:20:12,645
Oh, what the hell.

243
00:20:19,333 --> 00:20:23,292
Here, Dwight.
The boots only cost $299.99.

244
00:20:23,453 --> 00:20:26,365
You invest this penny like you wanted.
Thanks, Dad.

245
00:20:26,533 --> 00:20:29,525
I'm gonna take this and buy
five shares of Amazon.com.

246
00:20:29,813 --> 00:20:32,247
A risk-Taker. That's my boy.

247
00:20:32,613 --> 00:20:37,004
The entire surplus is gone!
Oh, what a McGovern I've been.

248
00:20:37,173 --> 00:20:39,892
Why did I have to issue
that crooked tax rebate?

249
00:20:40,093 --> 00:20:43,722
At least we got a few mildly
interesting stories out of it.

250
00:20:43,933 --> 00:20:45,252
Oh, my, yes.

251
00:20:45,453 --> 00:20:47,728
Speaking of which,
my story kind of petered out...

252
00:20:47,893 --> 00:20:49,292
Without me learning a lesson.

253
00:20:50,613 --> 00:20:52,365
There he is.

254
00:20:53,693 --> 00:20:55,843
All right! Closure!

255
00:21:00,533 --> 00:21:03,047
Stop that! Ow!

256
00:21:04,493 --> 00:21:07,132
"Futurama".
Noun.

257
00:21:07,293 --> 00:21:09,523
I don't know.
You just watched it, dummy.

258
00:21:09,693 --> 00:21:11,285
What are you asking me for?

259
00:21:11,453 --> 00:21:13,523
Hey, here's a fun definition.

260
00:21:13,693 --> 00:21:16,491
"Idiot".
Noun.

261
00:21:16,653 --> 00:21:17,927
You!

262
00:21:19,973 --> 00:21:24,091
This has been Roseanne,
your guide to the world of facts.
