1
00:00:07,253 --> 00:00:09,403
The Luck of the Fryfish

2
00:00:36,613 --> 00:00:41,846
- Push, Mrs. Fry. You're almost there.
- Squeeze one out for America, honey.

3
00:00:42,053 --> 00:00:44,248
Keep it down,
it's the 9th inning.

4
00:00:44,413 --> 00:00:49,533
<i>Here's the 0-2 pitch to Crypool.
He's called on a strike three.</i>

5
00:00:49,693 --> 00:00:51,251
Swing the bat, you bum!

6
00:00:54,133 --> 00:00:57,887
- It's a boy with red hair.
- You saying my son's a commie?

7
00:00:58,133 --> 00:01:03,161
<i>And Groady leans into the pitch.
It hits him. The Mets win.</i>

8
00:01:03,333 --> 00:01:05,927
This is the happiest day of my life.

9
00:01:06,093 --> 00:01:08,402
- Here's your baby.
- Okay, thanks.

10
00:01:08,573 --> 00:01:11,883
- What should we name him?
- You pick. I picked dinner.

11
00:01:12,093 --> 00:01:15,403
I was thinking of Philip,
after those screwdrivers.

12
00:01:15,613 --> 00:01:18,764
That's a fantastic idea.
More morphine, please!

13
00:01:20,093 --> 00:01:24,325
- Look, Yancy, it's baby Philip.
- I wanna be named Philip.

14
00:01:24,493 --> 00:01:26,768
Me Philip! Me Philip!

15
00:01:27,173 --> 00:01:32,008
Son, your name is Yancy, just like me,
and my grandfather and so on.

16
00:01:32,173 --> 00:01:35,529
All the way back
to minuteman Yancy Fry...

17
00:01:35,693 --> 00:01:38,924
...who blasted commies
in the American Revolution.

18
00:01:40,813 --> 00:01:44,362
Philip, until I find a suitable
model of an ICBM...

19
00:01:44,533 --> 00:01:48,446
...you'll have to make do
fearing this toy spacecraft.

20
00:01:52,613 --> 00:01:55,127
Mine! Mine!

21
00:02:14,693 --> 00:02:17,207
- Come on!
- Baby needs new shoes.

22
00:02:17,373 --> 00:02:20,171
To hell with your baby.
I need those shoes.

23
00:02:23,133 --> 00:02:27,411
<i>It's a dead heat. They're checking
the electron microscope.</i>

24
00:02:27,733 --> 00:02:32,409
<i>The winner is Number Three
in a quantum finish.</i>

25
00:02:32,653 --> 00:02:36,692
No fair! You changed the outcome
by measuring it.

26
00:02:36,853 --> 00:02:40,766
- How did you do, Fry?
- I'll tell you when my horse finishes.

27
00:02:40,933 --> 00:02:41,968
Bad.

28
00:02:43,893 --> 00:02:46,453
We owned four horses
and two jockeys.

29
00:02:46,693 --> 00:02:50,288
We just put a jockey out to stud.
He's perfect for you.

30
00:02:51,013 --> 00:02:53,652
Hey, baby, ever do it in a suitcase?

31
00:02:53,893 --> 00:02:56,043
Look, it's a centaur race.

32
00:03:01,413 --> 00:03:02,846
Come on, come on!

33
00:03:03,013 --> 00:03:06,483
Hey, Leela, how about a kiss
for good luck?

34
00:03:07,213 --> 00:03:08,532
I meant tongue luck.

35
00:03:09,973 --> 00:03:13,886
<i>The winner is Number Four, Steven.</i>

36
00:03:14,053 --> 00:03:18,444
I've run over black cats
that were luckier than me.

37
00:03:18,653 --> 00:03:22,771
Get your hot horse-burgers,
horse-fries, horse-cakes and shakes.

38
00:03:22,933 --> 00:03:26,926
- Tongue straight from the horse's mouth.
- It all sounds good.

39
00:03:27,133 --> 00:03:31,763
All our horses are 1 00% horse-fed
for that double juiced-in goodness.

40
00:03:31,973 --> 00:03:35,329
I'll have a cholesterol-free
omelet with horse-beaters.

41
00:03:35,493 --> 00:03:38,849
- How can I horse you, sir?
- I'll have a horse Coke.

42
00:03:39,053 --> 00:03:41,089
- Horse Pepsi okay?
- Neigh!

43
00:03:59,693 --> 00:04:02,765
- Hey! What are you doing?
- This.

44
00:04:04,533 --> 00:04:09,243
Dear Horse God, I don't usually pray.
Sometimes I doubt you even exist.

45
00:04:09,413 --> 00:04:13,964
But if you're willing to grant me luck,
please, stamp your hoof once.

46
00:04:18,973 --> 00:04:22,010
Come on, Number Six. Move it!

47
00:04:24,253 --> 00:04:26,972
Don't do that. What are you...?

48
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:28,561
It's contagious.

49
00:04:29,213 --> 00:04:33,491
<i>And the winner is Harry Trotter
by the entire racetrack.</i>

50
00:04:36,213 --> 00:04:38,966
That'll teach those horses
to take drugs.

51
00:04:39,813 --> 00:04:43,488
That's it! You can only take
my money for so long...

52
00:04:43,653 --> 00:04:46,292
...before you take it all.
I say, enough!

53
00:04:46,533 --> 00:04:51,084
I've got one dollar left,
and this one I'm holding on to.

54
00:04:51,373 --> 00:04:52,567
Oh, no, you don't.

55
00:05:02,533 --> 00:05:07,323
I may not know about horses, but I
know lots about doing anything for $ 1.

56
00:05:12,413 --> 00:05:18,124
If you think bad luck can defeat me,
you don't know my name is Philip J...

57
00:05:26,933 --> 00:05:30,209
That is one unlucky guy.

58
00:05:36,533 --> 00:05:41,323
Kareem has the sky hook,
but Philip J. Fry has the space hook.

59
00:05:44,973 --> 00:05:49,171
Yancy drives, he goes up
with his patented space hook.

60
00:05:49,373 --> 00:05:52,763
Hey! That's my patented space hook.
You stole it.

61
00:05:52,933 --> 00:05:55,891
You're not the president of it.

62
00:06:02,453 --> 00:06:05,172
Holy camolie! A seven-leaf clover.

63
00:06:05,333 --> 00:06:07,801
I'm dying of old age!

64
00:06:17,693 --> 00:06:21,732
Game over! Phil wins.
Yancy's fans are stunned.

65
00:06:21,893 --> 00:06:25,124
There'll be no celebration
at the Yancy Dome.

66
00:06:25,293 --> 00:06:26,487
Lucky!

67
00:06:35,053 --> 00:06:36,725
Someone's in a good mode.

68
00:06:36,933 --> 00:06:40,926
Let's say I lucked out at the track.
Also I rigged one race.

69
00:06:41,093 --> 00:06:45,405
I'd have won too, if I still had my
seven-leaf clover.

70
00:06:45,613 --> 00:06:48,081
Plus, I'd still have my hair.

71
00:06:48,253 --> 00:06:52,087
I got your page, Mr. Fry.
Your new hair is ready.

72
00:06:53,453 --> 00:06:55,364
What happened to this clover?

73
00:06:55,573 --> 00:07:00,089
I hid it in a secret place and never
told anyone. Not even Scruffy.

74
00:07:02,533 --> 00:07:07,163
- So is it still in the hiding place?
- Yeah, maybe it is still there.

75
00:07:07,333 --> 00:07:11,326
In the ruins of Old New York.
Helping one ant defeat another.

76
00:07:11,493 --> 00:07:15,611
- Or giving luck to a piece of dirt.
- Dirt doesn't need luck.

77
00:07:15,813 --> 00:07:18,043
I'm going to get my clover back!

78
00:07:18,213 --> 00:07:22,092
Some of the tunnels have metal bars.
Who's good at bending?

79
00:07:22,253 --> 00:07:23,845
- How about you?
- Sure.

80
00:07:24,173 --> 00:07:26,971
- But Bending's my middle name.
- It is?

81
00:07:27,213 --> 00:07:31,126
Yep. My full name is
Bender Bending Rodriguez.

82
00:07:33,613 --> 00:07:38,971
Here's the entrance. From this moment,
I declare my bad luck officially over.

83
00:07:42,773 --> 00:07:43,888
He was fun.

84
00:07:50,133 --> 00:07:55,048
If we get bored looking for the clover,
I've got Tetris on this thing.

85
00:07:55,213 --> 00:07:58,011
- Look, up ahead.
- Old New York.

86
00:07:58,213 --> 00:08:01,364
The city that inspired
a casino in Las Vegas.

87
00:08:02,293 --> 00:08:04,682
We've got Manhattan
all to ourselves.

88
00:08:04,853 --> 00:08:08,209
I can finally do the crazy stuff
I always dreamed.

89
00:08:08,893 --> 00:08:12,408
Howard Stern is overrated.

90
00:08:14,413 --> 00:08:16,881
- Oops!
- New York is so burned.

91
00:08:17,093 --> 00:08:20,005
Remember when Giuliani
cracked down on jaywalking?

92
00:08:20,213 --> 00:08:22,966
Well, Rudy, how do you like
this action?

93
00:08:30,693 --> 00:08:33,366
The big breakdance battle
is Saturday.

94
00:08:33,533 --> 00:08:36,809
If we wanna win
Jam Master Jay's parachute pants...

95
00:08:36,973 --> 00:08:40,727
...our crew has to pop,
lock and bust the freshest.

96
00:08:40,893 --> 00:08:43,532
Noticeably F.A.T., drop us a beat.

97
00:08:47,493 --> 00:08:49,131
- Name?
- Cosmic F.

98
00:08:49,333 --> 00:08:51,403
- Style?
- Outer space.

99
00:08:51,653 --> 00:08:54,247
- Special moves?
- The moonwalk.

100
00:08:54,413 --> 00:08:58,884
The robot.
The zero G.

101
00:08:59,493 --> 00:09:01,324
- Name?
- Cosmic Y.

102
00:09:01,573 --> 00:09:03,928
- Style?
- Deep Space.

103
00:09:04,133 --> 00:09:05,361
Deep Space?!

104
00:09:05,653 --> 00:09:08,167
- Special moves?
- The space-walk.

105
00:09:08,413 --> 00:09:11,052
- The robot.
- That's similar to mine.

106
00:09:11,213 --> 00:09:14,523
The zero G.

107
00:09:14,693 --> 00:09:18,766
- You totally ripped off my routine.
- You calling me a biter?

108
00:09:20,013 --> 00:09:24,689
Why do you always have to steal
everything from me, Yancy?

109
00:09:24,893 --> 00:09:28,681
- Stop illing. Word.
- I'd like to see you steal this:

110
00:09:28,853 --> 00:09:30,605
The septuple head-spin!

111
00:09:31,573 --> 00:09:35,248
He's just scratching. No one's done
more than a quadruple.

112
00:09:35,493 --> 00:09:38,769
Oh, yeah? Noticeably F.A.T.,
rewind the tape.

113
00:09:54,253 --> 00:09:55,447
Crazy sucker.

114
00:09:57,293 --> 00:10:00,649
- Phil, you're hot.
- That was ice-cold, bro.

115
00:10:00,813 --> 00:10:04,806
Fry, if I ever see you try
anything that crazy again...

116
00:10:04,973 --> 00:10:08,807
...this crew might just have
some new parachute pants.

117
00:10:13,013 --> 00:10:14,651
Stop hogging the clover.

118
00:10:27,133 --> 00:10:31,126
- Let's go find that clover.
- Which way to your house?

119
00:10:31,293 --> 00:10:36,367
- The sign says we're at 71 st Street.
- 71 st Street? Never heard of it.

120
00:10:36,533 --> 00:10:41,812
- Downtown could be in any direction.
- We'll just take a spin on the B-train.

121
00:10:43,533 --> 00:10:46,491
That feels funny!

122
00:10:47,613 --> 00:10:51,925
This is the Brooklyn-bound B-train,
stopping wherever I feel like.

123
00:10:52,093 --> 00:10:55,642
Watch for the closing doors.

124
00:11:08,733 --> 00:11:12,043
Wake up, buddy. End of the line.

125
00:11:14,533 --> 00:11:16,012
My old neighborhood.

126
00:11:17,173 --> 00:11:22,531
That's the bench where I found shirts.
We used to light that hydrant on fire!

127
00:11:22,693 --> 00:11:26,572
On that corner, some guy
handed out a socialist newsletter.

128
00:11:26,813 --> 00:11:29,122
- Was it poorly xeroxed?
- Oh, yeah.

129
00:11:29,293 --> 00:11:32,808
The comedians were right.
This is different from L.A.

130
00:11:33,893 --> 00:11:37,488
- Did you say you used to live here?
- That's right.

131
00:11:37,733 --> 00:11:41,442
- Did you know Andy Goldman?
- He was my neighbor. Why?

132
00:11:41,613 --> 00:11:46,164
- I mutated from him.
- What's he up to these days?

133
00:11:47,173 --> 00:11:48,970
I'm teaching.

134
00:11:49,453 --> 00:11:52,013
- He seemed nice.
- Sure, when he's sober.

135
00:11:54,933 --> 00:11:59,449
Holy camolie! The house I grew up in,
it's still there!

136
00:11:59,613 --> 00:12:03,492
Man, Father Time really took
a bat to this place.

137
00:12:05,973 --> 00:12:10,524
That stupid clover is a worthless
piece of garbage. Give it!

138
00:12:10,773 --> 00:12:12,525
Mom, help!

139
00:12:13,853 --> 00:12:14,922
Yes!

140
00:12:15,093 --> 00:12:19,803
- Yancy's trying to steal my clover.
- Yancy, stealing is wrong.

141
00:12:19,973 --> 00:12:23,807
I'm gonna pile drive you.
You're dead meat!

142
00:12:24,893 --> 00:12:28,568
What's happening?
Did Kremlin Joe let fly with the nukes?

143
00:12:28,733 --> 00:12:32,282
Not yet, commander.
Yancy's trying to steal my stuff.

144
00:12:32,533 --> 00:12:35,286
He better keep his hands
off these bananas.

145
00:12:35,453 --> 00:12:39,651
Gonna need them when the radiation
turns us all into monkeys.

146
00:12:41,973 --> 00:12:47,411
The Ronco Record Vault. Yancy will
never get his hands on you in here.

147
00:12:49,453 --> 00:12:52,126
<i>The Breakfast Club soundtrack.</i>

148
00:12:52,293 --> 00:12:56,844
I can't wait until I'm old enough
to feel ways about stuff.

149
00:12:59,773 --> 00:13:04,085
Stay safe, clover.
I may need you again someday.

150
00:13:12,573 --> 00:13:16,282
My dad spent years turning this
into a bomb shelter.

151
00:13:16,453 --> 00:13:20,685
- Yet there was no nuclear war.
- What a waste.

152
00:13:20,893 --> 00:13:24,932
This is it. My Ronco Record Vault.

153
00:13:25,333 --> 00:13:28,609
I still remember the combination.

154
00:13:28,773 --> 00:13:30,968
Three.

155
00:13:31,133 --> 00:13:32,168
It's stuck.

156
00:13:32,333 --> 00:13:37,885
The Achilles' heel of the Ronco design
is its structural resonance frequency.

157
00:13:47,813 --> 00:13:49,690
There we go.

158
00:13:50,093 --> 00:13:54,723
<i>- Here's The Breakfast Club soundtrack.
- You mean breakfast club sandwich?</i>

159
00:13:54,893 --> 00:14:00,331
I hid my clover in the jacket
so my brother, Yancy, wouldn't get it.

160
00:14:00,493 --> 00:14:02,324
Here goes.

161
00:14:02,493 --> 00:14:06,771
It's gone! The whole place
has been cleaned out.

162
00:14:06,933 --> 00:14:11,324
- Yancy stole my clover.
- How do you know it didn't disintegrate?

163
00:14:11,533 --> 00:14:15,845
<i>- Everything else held up okay.
- Except Sports, by Huey Lewis.</i>

164
00:14:18,973 --> 00:14:23,489
- My brother hated me so much.
- Brothers always fight.

165
00:14:23,653 --> 00:14:28,568
He just never got a chance to say
he loved you before you got frozen.

166
00:14:28,733 --> 00:14:32,089
You think? Because I always
kind of wished that...

167
00:14:33,133 --> 00:14:36,648
- Who is that godlike figure?
- It's my brother, Yancy.

168
00:14:36,813 --> 00:14:41,364
And there's my seven-leaf clover.
I knew he stole it.

169
00:14:41,613 --> 00:14:45,891
If that's Yancy, why does
the inscription say Philip J. Fry?

170
00:14:46,053 --> 00:14:48,169
Wait a second. That's my name.

171
00:14:48,333 --> 00:14:51,962
Good Lord! He ditched his goofy name
and stole mine.

172
00:14:52,213 --> 00:14:56,286
Apparently, this brave adonis,
this Cadillac of men...

173
00:14:56,693 --> 00:15:00,163
...was the "first person on Mars."
- First person on Mars?!

174
00:15:00,333 --> 00:15:02,369
That should've been me!

175
00:15:02,533 --> 00:15:06,446
He stole my clover, he stole my name
and he stole my life.

176
00:15:07,293 --> 00:15:11,206
- And now he broke my hand.
- His legend lives on.

177
00:15:15,733 --> 00:15:19,009
You opened the vault,
and the clover was gone?

178
00:15:19,173 --> 00:15:23,405
Nothing in there
but the best music of the 1 980s.

179
00:15:23,573 --> 00:15:27,452
Survivor, Pat Benatar, The Scorpions.
The list goes on.

180
00:15:27,693 --> 00:15:31,129
My brother stole my dream
of going into space.

181
00:15:31,293 --> 00:15:34,649
- Now I'll never get there.
- You went this morning.

182
00:15:34,893 --> 00:15:39,205
"First person on Mars."
So your brother was that Philip J. Fry.

183
00:15:39,813 --> 00:15:44,523
- I'm Philip J. Fry! He stole my name.
- Shut up, friends.

184
00:15:44,693 --> 00:15:51,041
My browser heard the word "Fry"
and found the Philip J. Fry movie.

185
00:15:51,893 --> 00:15:56,364
It also opened my calendar to Friday
and ordered some french fries.

186
00:15:59,493 --> 00:16:03,452
<i>Philip J. Fry, astronaut,
philanthropist, entrepreneur...</i>

187
00:16:03,613 --> 00:16:06,525
<i>... was a great man,
truly worthy of narration.</i>

188
00:16:06,693 --> 00:16:10,402
<i>Fry was the first man on Mars,
a feat never equaled.</i>

189
00:16:10,613 --> 00:16:11,966
It should've been me!

190
00:16:12,253 --> 00:16:15,609
<i>The ever-lucky Fry
made his fortune by striking oil...</i>

191
00:16:15,813 --> 00:16:18,771
<i>... in the mansion
he had won in a lottery.</i>

192
00:16:18,933 --> 00:16:21,083
That's my clover. He stole it!

193
00:16:21,293 --> 00:16:24,490
<i>After a fling with
Icelandic supermodel, Njord...</i>

194
00:16:24,693 --> 00:16:28,049
<i>... Fry scored many hits
with his band, Leaf Seven...</i>

195
00:16:28,213 --> 00:16:31,649
<i>... known for their hypnotic rhythms
and memorable hooks.</i>

196
00:16:31,853 --> 00:16:33,127
I'm known for that!

197
00:16:33,333 --> 00:16:38,691
<i>Phil came and strummed out this tune.
And I said that's a number-one record.</i>

198
00:16:38,973 --> 00:16:44,366
<i>Fry now spends most of his time in his
grave at Orbiting Meadows Cemetery...</i>

199
00:16:44,613 --> 00:16:50,210
<i>... buried with his trademark clover
to bring him luck in the next life.</i>

200
00:16:50,453 --> 00:16:54,287
That's where my clover is.
Is that cemetery near here?

201
00:16:54,453 --> 00:16:59,766
- It will be in a couple of hours.
- Good, we're going grave robbing.

202
00:16:59,933 --> 00:17:02,527
I'll get my kit.

203
00:17:05,613 --> 00:17:08,923
Your tux will be perfect
for my wedding, Dad.

204
00:17:09,093 --> 00:17:12,563
Yancy, that tux got me through
Nam in style.

205
00:17:14,053 --> 00:17:19,081
- I wish your bother could see this.
- I remember the day he disappeared.

206
00:17:19,253 --> 00:17:23,087
Wisconsin won the Rose Bowl 1 7-9.
Oh, I miss him.

207
00:17:23,253 --> 00:17:27,565
I was gonna rummage through
Phil's records to play at the wedding.

208
00:17:27,813 --> 00:17:31,089
He may be missing,
but his crap sure isn't.

209
00:17:58,733 --> 00:18:03,761
<i>Breakfast Club. This will clear
the room after the reception.</i>

210
00:18:16,453 --> 00:18:20,162
He's buried in the world heroes
section? I'm impressed.

211
00:18:20,373 --> 00:18:23,285
I should be the one in that grave!

212
00:18:36,013 --> 00:18:37,924
We lost Bender.

213
00:18:38,093 --> 00:18:42,769
Now no one will be able to say
I don't own John Larroquette's spine.

214
00:18:45,013 --> 00:18:46,924
Aha! My brother's grave!

215
00:18:50,053 --> 00:18:52,692
"Philip Fry, the original Martian."

216
00:18:53,053 --> 00:18:56,807
It's all lies. He wasn't original.
He wasn't a Martian.

217
00:18:56,973 --> 00:19:02,525
- He wasn't Philip. He wasn't a "the."
- You're twice the "the" he ever was.

218
00:19:02,693 --> 00:19:04,331
It's clovering time.

219
00:19:19,573 --> 00:19:25,011
- So, had any ideas for names, Yancy?
- I'm sort of thinking one.

220
00:19:25,173 --> 00:19:29,883
Daddy has a present for you.
Know what it is? It's a lucky clover...

221
00:19:30,053 --> 00:19:33,443
...to help you be successful,
even at breakdancing.

222
00:19:33,613 --> 00:19:36,411
It belonged to someone very special.

223
00:19:36,573 --> 00:19:39,804
I know what name you want
to give him. It's okay.

224
00:19:39,973 --> 00:19:44,489
Really? Son, I'm naming you
Philip J. Fry...

225
00:19:44,653 --> 00:19:49,283
...in honor of my little brother,
who I miss every day.

226
00:19:49,453 --> 00:19:54,129
I love you, Philip.
And I always will.

227
00:20:03,053 --> 00:20:07,285
"Here lies Philip J. Fry,
named for his uncle...

228
00:20:07,453 --> 00:20:10,684
...to carry on his spirit."

229
00:20:11,733 --> 00:20:17,603
Pay dirt! I got the clover, plus his
wedding ring. Sorry, ladies, I'm taken.

230
00:20:17,773 --> 00:20:21,448
Hey, Fry, you want me
to smack the corpse up a little?

231
00:20:28,613 --> 00:20:31,252
Bender, I think Fry
needs a moment alone.

232
00:20:31,453 --> 00:20:35,810
Okay, grab a shovel. I'm one skull
short of a Mouseketeer reunion.
