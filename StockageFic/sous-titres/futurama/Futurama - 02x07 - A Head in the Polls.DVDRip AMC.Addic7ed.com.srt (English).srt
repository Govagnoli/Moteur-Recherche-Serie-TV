1
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:09,310
A Head in the Polls

2
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:38,596
<i>You're entering the vicinity</i>
<i>of an area ad</i>j<i>acent to a location.</i>

3
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:42,594
<i>A place you might find a monster</i>
<i>or weird mirror.</i>

4
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:45,991
<i>These are examples.</i>
<i>It could be much better.</i>

5
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:49,118
<i>Prepare to enter</i> The Scary Door.

6
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:02,639
<i>Per your re</i>q<i>uest, please find enclosed</i>
<i>the last man on earth.</i>

7
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:08,239
Finally, solitude.
I can read books for all eternity.

8
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:13,035
It's not fair.
It's not fair!

9
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:18,308
Wait, my eyes aren't that bad.
I can read the large print books.

10
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:23,759
It's not...!
Well, lucky I can read braille.

11
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:28,639
Hey, look, a weird mirror.

12
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,511
Cursed by his own hubris.

13
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:34,234
A debate's on!
Change the channel!

14
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:37,591
That's what Fry said
when we turned on the debate.

15
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:41,110
<i>C- Span</i> 9 <i>presents</i>
<i>"The Thrill of Politics. "</i>

16
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:48,431
There are no car chases...

17
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:52,559
...but one of these men will become
president of the world.

18
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:54,830
So? We live in the United States.

19
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,031
That's part of the world.

20
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:59,151
I have been gone a long time.

21
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:02,636
It's time someone
had the courage to say:

22
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,599
"I'm against things everybody hates. "

23
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:09,156
I respect my opponent.
He's a good man.

24
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,875
But frankly, I agree with everything
he just said!

25
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:16,312
These candidates sound like clones.

26
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,398
Wait, they are clones!

27
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:22,553
Even with identical DNA,
they differ on key issues.

28
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:26,309
Your three-cent titanium tax
goes too far!

29
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:30,633
Your three-cent titanium tax
doesn't go too far enough!

30
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:33,638
If I were registered,
I'd send a message...

31
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,434
...by staying home on election day,
dressed like a clown.

32
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:39,598
- You're not registered?
- Not vaccinated, either.

33
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,394
One vote never made a difference.

34
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:46,275
The first robot president won
by exactly one vote.

35
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,550
John <i>Q</i>uincy Adding Machine.

36
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:53,038
He enticed voters by pledging
not to go on a killing spree.

37
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,795
But, like most, he promised
more than he could deliver.

38
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:59,110
One vote can make a difference...

39
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:02,830
...and even though it won't,
you're going to register.

40
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:07,238
Yes, that's a capital idea!
Let's all go register.

41
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:09,755
When did you care about voting?

42
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:12,235
The very instant I became old.

43
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:23,190
The problem is,
both parties give your tax dollars...

44
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,958
...to the less fortunate.

45
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,718
They get all the breaks!

46
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:29,599
You could join a third party, maybe.

47
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:32,792
Only weirdos and mutants
join third parties.

48
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,390
I'd better keep an eye out
at the next meeting.

49
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:39,592
- What's your party, Bender?
- I can't vote.

50
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:42,314
- Because you're a robot?
- No, a felon.

51
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:53,029
We favor huge subsidies
to the Brain Slug planet.

52
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:57,068
Okay, but what are the Brain Slugs
gonna do for the working man?

53
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:00,829
- Attach Brain Slugs to them.
- Sure, you say that now.

54
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:06,196
Is it true you can make shirts
and rope out of hemp?

55
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:08,032
Dave's not here, man.

56
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:11,192
- I heard hemp makes great shampoo.
- It does?

57
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:15,552
No way!
I gotta check out this brochure.

58
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:23,229
What are you doing to protect my right
to bear doomsday devices?

59
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:28,315
We'll get rid of the three-day
waiting period for mad scientists.

60
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:32,229
Today, the mad scientist can't get
a doomsday device...

61
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:36,234
...tomorrow, the mad grad student.
Where will it end?

62
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:40,194
Amen! I don't go anywhere
without my mutated anthrax...

63
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,759
...for duck hunting.

64
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,998
Sure, humans are cute...

65
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,509
...but how will we test cosmetics?

66
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:47,954
I concur.

67
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:52,239
Here's a party to get excited about.
Sign me up.

68
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:54,351
Not with that attitude.

69
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,393
- Okay, screw it.
- Welcome aboard, brother!

70
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,352
- All right!
- You're out.

71
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,917
I'm actually getting interested
in politics.

72
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:15,637
W<i>ith two weeks left,</i>
<i>the</i> q<i>uestion is...</i>

73
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:19,196
<i>... who will be</i>
<i>the next president of Earth?</i>

74
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:22,995
J<i>ack</i> J<i>ohnson,</i>
<i>or bitter rival,</i> J<i>ohn</i> J<i>ackson?</i>

75
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:25,470
<i>Terrific candidates, huh, Morbo?</i>

76
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:28,956
<i>All humans are vermin</i>
<i>in the eyes of Morbo.</i>

77
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,276
<i>Disaster struck</i>
<i>on Saturn 's moon, Titan...</i>

78
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:39,678
<i>... when a titanium mine collapsed,</i>
<i>trapping 1000 robot workers.</i>

79
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:41,869
Good lord!

80
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:46,437
W<i>ithout a</i> q<i>uick response,</i>
<i>the robots will die within 300 years.</i>

81
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:49,400
W<i>hat rescue operations are planned?</i>

82
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,997
W<i>e'll pave over the area,</i>
<i>then move on.</i>

83
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:58,596
<i>The news sent</i>
<i>titanium prices skyrocketing.</i>

84
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,870
- I'm rich!
- What do you mean?

85
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:03,275
My body's 40 percent titanium.

86
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:06,711
I'm finally richer than those
snooty ATMs.

87
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:10,037
- Too bad you can't spend it.
- Oh, can't I?

88
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,708
- No.
- Watch me, poor man.

89
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:16,394
Pleasure doing business with you.

90
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:21,191
Game's over, losers.
I have all the money.

91
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:25,632
Compare your lives to mine,
and then kill yourselves.

92
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,836
Hey, get away!

93
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:31,993
You get five dollars to not do
what you're thinking about.

94
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,914
You just lost five dollars.

95
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:43,630
Hey, buddy, little help?

96
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:45,472
Thank you!

97
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:50,113
Hello, peasants.

98
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,839
What happened to you?

99
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,036
Yeah, did you get a haircut?

100
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,879
No, I sold my body!

101
00:06:57,160 --> 00:07:00,994
Sold your body?
Bender, I've been down that road.

102
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:03,800
It's glamorous,
the parties are great...

103
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,198
...but you'll spend every dollar
on jewelry and skintight pants.

104
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,631
How are you gonna live without a body?

105
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:14,599
Bodies are for hookers and fat people.

106
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,394
All I need is a wad of
cash with a head.

107
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:22,799
- Now you can pay off your loan shark.
- What's he gonna do, break my legs?

108
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:26,432
This is the life.

109
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:29,638
Another martini, please?

110
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:34,153
Shaken, not stirred.

111
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,599
Yeah!

112
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,792
Put it all on black.

113
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:50,430
21 red.

114
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:52,989
I beg your pardon, 33 black.

115
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:55,714
Yes!
The rich get richer!

116
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:09,996
Strike!
In your face, Leela!

117
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:29,189
Timber!

118
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:32,236
Can I ride in your car?

119
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:35,870
No, it looks like your neck stepped
in something.

120
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:40,394
Oh, I'm sorry, that's just your body.

121
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:44,235
Look me in the shins and say that!

122
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:46,988
I've had it up to here
with this place.

123
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:52,479
I'm off to hang out with classy heads
like me, who appreciate...

124
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:55,115
...poetry, philosophy, hats.

125
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:58,198
So long, coffin stuffers!

126
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:07,879
Could one of you coffin stuffers
please carry me?

127
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:21,231
Which group of heads is good enough
for me?

128
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,198
What do you think, Fry?

129
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,195
Hi, I'm Claudia Schiffer's head.

130
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:30,392
I recognize you.
Didn't you have a body?

131
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,596
Yeah, but it was holding me back.

132
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:37,635
I just did the cover of
the <i>Sports Illustrated</i> Swim Cap Issue.

133
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:39,393
You're looking great.

134
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:43,514
- I'd like to lose a few pounds.
- Couldn't hurt.

135
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,708
U.S. presidents.

136
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:52,191
Sturdy shelves, good security.

137
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:54,239
This place has class.

138
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:58,917
Hi, sugar. Legally, nothing I can do
counts as sex anymore.

139
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:03,472
I apologize. He gets this way
around meaty-Iooking women.

140
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:06,713
I remember you.
I was gonna vote for you.

141
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:10,430
But voting isn't cool,
so I got trashed on Listerine.

142
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:14,110
I've never felt voting is essential
to the process.

143
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:16,430
No kidding, Ford.

144
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:20,395
So the hooker-bot says,
"That's not my expansion slot"...

145
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:25,435
...and my friend says,
"That's not my 25-pin connector! "

146
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:30,989
Bender, thou robots
really cracketh me up.

147
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:34,596
I like it here.
What's the rent for a jar?

148
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:38,589
Sorry, we can't let every
Tom, Dick and Harry move in.

149
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:41,394
No offense,
Jefferson, Nixon and Truman.

150
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:44,831
How about the closet
of presidential losers?

151
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:49,069
Bob Dole needs company.
LaRouche won't stop telling jokes.

152
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:52,631
- Pass.
- What hath happened to your body?

153
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:55,599
- I hocked it.
- Why wouldst thou do that?

154
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:59,759
- Same reason you hocked your teeth.
- Ah, booze money.

155
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:01,359
I remember my body:

156
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:05,394
Flabby, pasty-skinned,
riddled with phlebitis.

157
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:08,473
A good Republican body.
God, I loved it.

158
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:13,914
I spent my teen years loving my body.
Of course, it was tough love...

159
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:18,990
He opened relations with China.
He doesn't care about your ding-dong.

160
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:23,239
Even if you miss your body,
being a head's great too?

161
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:26,512
No, son.
It's a sad and Ionely life.

162
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,518
Great!
Now you tell me.

163
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,997
That's my style.
Kick them when they're down.

164
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:42,633
Ones, zeros...

165
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:45,713
...one, one, zero, zero, one...

166
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,433
- Bender, what is it?
- What an awful dream.

167
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:55,117
Ones and zeros everywhere!
And I thought I saw a two.

168
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:58,352
It was just a dream.
There are no twos.

169
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:03,754
I know what's wrong. My body loved me,
and I turned its back on it.

170
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:09,154
Well, old friend, tie a yellow ribbon
round your neck. I'm coming home!

171
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:12,715
You sold my body!
To who?

172
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:17,994
I can't reveal that.
But I'll give you $50 for the kid.

173
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:21,431
- My clothes are worth 50 bucks.
- Deal.

174
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:29,228
How could I let this happen?
I can't go through life like this!

175
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:34,674
- What about your self-destruct button?
- It's on my body!

176
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:38,197
What am I gonna do?

177
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:44,876
I can't stand to see a robot cry.
Let's watch TV.

178
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:49,995
And so, ladies and gentlemen,
I'm throwing my head into the ring.

179
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:54,193
I'm announcing my candidacy
for the Presidency of Earth!

180
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:57,391
Sir, the Constitution states...

181
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:01,036
...nobody can be elected president
more than twice.

182
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:03,231
That's right, no "body. "

183
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:08,190
But, as you can plainly see,
I've got a shiny new body.

184
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,237
Bender, he's got your body!

185
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:18,429
That double-crossing bastard!
How dare he run off with Nixon!

186
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:25,632
- He must have bought your body.
- And that electric guitar.

187
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:38,477
I'm meeting you halfway,
you stupid hippies.

188
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:43,032
I am not a crook's head.

189
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:45,515
Yeah, you are!
You stole my body.

190
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:48,115
Fry, Leela, you gotta help me.

191
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:52,916
Ordinarily I'd say no, and how
it's your fault for being an idiot.

192
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:57,392
But when a robotic Nixon is loose,
we have to take action!

193
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:58,589
Idiot.

194
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:14,360
Morbo will introduce the candidates.

195
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:16,835
Puny human number one.

196
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:19,036
Puny human number two.

197
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:21,510
And my good friend, Richard Nixon.

198
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,955
Hello, Morbo.
How's the family?

199
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:26,077
Belligerent and numerous.

200
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:30,791
Good man.
Nixon's pro-war and pro-family.

201
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:37,395
First he steals my body,
now he's touching my stuff.

202
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:40,273
We've got to find a way
to talk to him.

203
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:45,836
Morbo demands an answer
to the following question:

204
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:49,629
If you saw candy in the hands
of a small child...

205
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:51,711
...would you seize and eat it?

206
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:52,995
Unthinkable!

207
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,394
Wouldn't think it!

208
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:59,037
What about you, Mr. Nixon?
You are under a truth-o-scope.

209
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,872
The question is vague.

210
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:09,279
You don't say what kind of candy,
whether anyone is watching...

211
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:14,398
I certainly wouldn't harm the child.

212
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:21,518
You scored big points.

213
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:25,031
What?
They ate me alive out there.

214
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:30,235
But your body's message was,
"Look at my shiny new body. "

215
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:33,995
You've got real charisma
from the neck down.

216
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,633
Nixon with charisma?

217
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:39,998
My God, I can rule the universe!

218
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,075
Give my body back, you thief!

219
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:47,239
Look here, you drugged-out communist.
I paid for this body...

220
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:51,189
...and I'd no sooner return it
than I would my dog.

221
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,195
Shut up!

222
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:57,189
Please, we're appealing
to your sense of decency.

223
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:05,517
Seriously, I'm never giving back
this body.

224
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:08,234
Beat it! Or I'll get Cambodian
on your asses!

225
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:17,388
It's hopeless. We might as well turn
in my head for the five-cent deposit.

226
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,592
My best friend's not getting recycled!

227
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:23,274
Not for five cents,
not for 500 cents.

228
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:26,074
- I have a plan.
- I have a better plan.

229
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:36,111
Why would Nixon stay here?

230
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:39,591
You get a discount
if you've been here before.

231
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:54,199
Keep going.
We're right behind you.

232
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:57,640
Whoa, mama.
Get a room, you two!

233
00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:01,031
- We're in a room!
- Then lose some weight!

234
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:12,594
Oh, yeah. You women's libbers
really know how to party.

235
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:14,195
There I am.

236
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:23,994
Hey, Betty Friedan,
send a little of that lotion my way.

237
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:26,236
Okay. Almost got it.

238
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:31,395
Steady. Steady.
Don't panic.

239
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:47,318
- You shaggy peaceniks have some nerve.
- I want what's mine!

240
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:51,752
- Don't make me kick your neck.
- Bring it on, soup can.

241
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:57,519
Break it up, you two!

242
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,796
That's it!
You're going to jail!

243
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,356
And I don't grant pardons
like that sissy, Ford.

244
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:09,394
You won't pardon anyone,
because you won't get elected.

245
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:12,956
The voters aren't pea-brained
idiots anymore.

246
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:15,037
No? Listen here, missy.

247
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:18,790
Computers may be twice as fast
as they were in 1973...

248
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:21,998
...but voters are as drunk
and stupid as ever!

249
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:28,196
The only one who's changed is me.
I've become bitter and crazy.

250
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:33,428
Once I'm in office, I'll sell our
children's organs to zoos for meat!

251
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:37,992
I'll go into people's houses at
night and wreck up the place!

252
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,159
He lost my vote.

253
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,795
One vote won't make a difference.

254
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:49,239
Excuse me, while I inch myself over
to the phone and call the police.

255
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:56,194
Not so fast, Nixon!
Are you familiar with audio tape?

256
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:59,914
I don't like where this is heading.

257
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:04,591
<i>I'll go into people's houses at</i>
<i>night and wreck up the place!</i>

258
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,036
I really sound like that?

259
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:10,953
I thought I had a Clark Gable quality.

260
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:15,153
We'll trade you the tape
for the body.

261
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:18,955
Oh, expletive deleted!
You've got a deal.

262
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:21,800
Hey, I've got one last thought.

263
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:31,033
It's good to be back
in one piece again...

264
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:34,352
...except for these damn
bumper stickers.

265
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:39,395
<i>The sheer drama has driven turnout</i>
<i>to its highest level in centuries...</i>

266
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:40,629
<i>... six percent!</i>

267
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:43,633
<i>Exit polls show evil underdog</i>
<i>Richard Nixon...</i>

268
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:46,075
<i>... trailing with zero votes.</i>

269
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:48,237
Yes, the system works!

270
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:52,035
<i>The time is 7:5</i>9<i>,</i>
<i>and the robot polls are opening.</i>

271
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:54,794
<i>The robot vote is in.</i>
<i>Nixon has won!</i>

272
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:59,996
Why'd they vote for him,
now that he's just a head?

273
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:05,395
I give you the next
president of Earth!

274
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,032
Nixon's back!

275
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:16,917
I can't believe it.
He won by a single vote.

276
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:20,311
It ain't my fault.
I'm a non-voting felon.

277
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:23,034
It's not my fault.
I forgot to vote.

278
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:26,556
Crud, I knew there was something
I meant to do today.

279
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:30,799
<i>Morbo congratulates</i>
<i>our gargantuan cyborg president.</i>

280
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:34,794
<i>May death come</i> q<i>uickly</i>
<i>to his enemies.</i>

281
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:46,393
Who's kicking who around now?

282
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:55,792
Knock knock.
