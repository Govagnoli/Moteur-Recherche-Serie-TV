00:00:07,413 --> 00:00:09,483
Futurama [5x05] - Kif Gets Knocked Up A Notch - CiWaN

2
00:00:33,293 --> 00:00:35,648
Whoo-Hoo! Yeah!

3
00:00:37,253 --> 00:00:39,209
Whoa! Ow!

4
00:00:40,093 --> 00:00:43,802
Schman! The great rad spot is
mega-Sweet for party boarding.

5
00:00:43,973 --> 00:00:46,646
Indeed.
Any calls while I was out?

6
00:00:46,853 --> 00:00:51,210
Yeah. You got a telesonic transmission
from Kif a couple hours ago.

7
00:00:51,693 --> 00:00:54,082
My Kify called?

8
00:00:55,573 --> 00:00:57,689
Kif?
Oh, Amy, you're back.

9
00:00:57,853 --> 00:01:00,128
Another hour and I would've
thought of hanging up.

10
00:01:00,333 --> 00:01:02,210
Why didn't you leave a message, sweetie?

11
00:01:02,413 --> 00:01:05,450
I've left hundreds of messages
with your answering machine...

12
00:01:05,613 --> 00:01:08,923
But you never seem to get them.
Bender!

13
00:01:09,133 --> 00:01:12,205
It's not my fault if you don't check me.

14
00:01:14,293 --> 00:01:15,612
Messages erased.

15
00:01:15,813 --> 00:01:19,806
Oh, dearest, this long-Distance
relationship is too much to bear.

16
00:01:19,973 --> 00:01:23,204
When even an inch separates us,
I quiver with misery.

17
00:01:23,373 --> 00:01:28,288
So you can imagine how I feel
when it's a billion light years.

18
00:01:28,973 --> 00:01:32,283
Kif, don't cry,
or you'll get a tummy ache.

19
00:01:32,773 --> 00:01:35,890
Lieutenant, some things came off me
and clogged the drain, so if you can--

20
00:01:36,053 --> 00:01:38,248
Oh-Ho. What's this?

21
00:01:40,293 --> 00:01:45,845
Well, well, well. Do my eyes believe me,
or is that my bosomy swan, Leela?

22
00:01:46,013 --> 00:01:47,969
Say again? You're breaking up.

23
00:01:49,413 --> 00:01:50,562
Oh .

24
00:01:50,773 --> 00:01:52,331
Good news, everyone.

25
00:01:52,493 --> 00:01:56,930
You'll be delivering pain medicine
to the hive mind of Nigel 7.

26
00:01:58,533 --> 00:02:00,842
Scruffy's rolling out a large pill.

27
00:02:01,053 --> 00:02:04,090
You're going to Nigel 7?
Kif's on patrol near there.

28
00:02:04,253 --> 00:02:07,006
You could drop me off on the way.
We could, but we won't!

29
00:02:07,173 --> 00:02:10,165
It's a spaceship, damn it,
not a prom limousine!

30
00:02:10,333 --> 00:02:15,361
Ooh! Lf anyone needs me,
I'll be in the angry dome.

31
00:02:23,853 --> 00:02:25,286
This is a very long trip.

32
00:02:25,453 --> 00:02:29,526
So we'll all have to go into
hibernative naptosis to save oxygen.

33
00:02:29,693 --> 00:02:32,924
I don't even breathe oxygen.

34
00:02:57,253 --> 00:02:58,686
Here I come, Kif.

35
00:03:07,853 --> 00:03:09,684
They jumped right out of their pants.

36
00:03:13,813 --> 00:03:17,203
Oh, what now? Activate glass window.

37
00:03:19,853 --> 00:03:23,163
Kif, I'm sensing a very sensual
disturbance in the Force.

38
00:03:23,333 --> 00:03:28,123
Prepare for ship-To-Ship intimacy.
Yes, sir, captain.

39
00:03:44,813 --> 00:03:47,805
How about I help you finish that
dream you were having about me?

40
00:03:47,973 --> 00:03:50,123
Okay. I was just at this part:

41
00:03:53,693 --> 00:03:56,844
Let's try that a little
lower and lots softer.

42
00:03:57,173 --> 00:04:01,007
Imagine you stowing away and
stealing a licensed starship.

43
00:04:01,173 --> 00:04:05,052
Oh, it's so romantic
it gives me the shivers.

44
00:04:05,213 --> 00:04:07,169
I don't care how much trouble I get in.

45
00:04:07,333 --> 00:04:11,167
I needed to feel my lips pressed
against your lip-Less beak.

46
00:04:11,973 --> 00:04:15,682
Oh, Amy, I can't stand having
a whole universe between us.

47
00:04:15,853 --> 00:04:20,608
I've been thinking a lot about this,
and-- Well, would you move in with me?

48
00:04:21,013 --> 00:04:24,483
Here? But, wouldn't it be crowded?

49
00:04:24,653 --> 00:04:27,167
Oh, no, no. It's really twice the size.

50
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:32,009
You can use the floor
and I'll have the ceiling. See?

51
00:04:33,493 --> 00:04:37,406
Kif, you have so much
creativity and niceness.

52
00:04:37,573 --> 00:04:40,041
But I'm not sure if l--
Hush.

53
00:04:40,213 --> 00:04:43,171
Before you answer, come thither.

54
00:04:44,493 --> 00:04:48,611
This is the Holo-Shed.
It can simulate anything you desire.

55
00:04:48,813 --> 00:04:51,532
And nothing can hurt you,
except when it malfunctions...

56
00:04:51,693 --> 00:04:53,331
And the holograms become real.

57
00:04:53,493 --> 00:04:55,449
Well, that probably
won't happen this time.

58
00:04:55,613 --> 00:04:59,083
I wanted to show you what life
could be like if we were together.

59
00:04:59,253 --> 00:05:02,370
Computer, run program Kif One.

60
00:05:05,133 --> 00:05:07,567
This is so beautiful!

61
00:05:08,533 --> 00:05:11,331
Spirit! Kif, that's the
pony I always wanted...

62
00:05:11,493 --> 00:05:13,882
But my parents said I had
too many ponies already.

63
00:05:14,053 --> 00:05:19,207
Yes. I programmed it in for you.
Four million lines of BASIC.

64
00:05:19,373 --> 00:05:22,570
And if this isn't the life
you want, how about this?

65
00:05:22,733 --> 00:05:25,088
Run program Kif Two.

66
00:05:27,213 --> 00:05:28,771
Oh, Kif.

67
00:05:28,973 --> 00:05:32,852
We could live here at the shore of the
Tranquilibrius Sea, in a time-Share.

68
00:05:33,013 --> 00:05:38,804
And I would pluck the moon from
the sky just to see you smile.

69
00:05:39,853 --> 00:05:42,048
Almost got it.

70
00:05:42,213 --> 00:05:45,250
Seems to be sort of stuck.

71
00:05:45,733 --> 00:05:48,247
I love you!

72
00:05:51,853 --> 00:05:55,766
Run program Kif-Colon-
Slash-Slash-Three!

73
00:05:58,573 --> 00:06:01,246
This isn't bad.
My aunt had a place like this.

74
00:06:01,413 --> 00:06:04,962
Amy, we could live in a bus
station bathroom for all I care.

75
00:06:05,173 --> 00:06:08,449
As long as we're together,
it'll feel like a castle to me.

76
00:06:08,773 --> 00:06:13,164
Kif, I'd love to live with you.
Someday.

77
00:06:13,333 --> 00:06:16,450
But before then, there's still
lots I want to do on my own.

78
00:06:18,613 --> 00:06:20,251
What was that?
Oh, dear.

79
00:06:20,413 --> 00:06:22,722
I fear the Holo-Shed
might be broken again.

80
00:06:22,893 --> 00:06:25,885
Well, as long as we don't
cross paths with Attila the--

81
00:06:28,693 --> 00:06:30,843
Look! Spirit!

82
00:06:32,213 --> 00:06:34,283
And there's Professor Moriarty.

83
00:06:34,493 --> 00:06:35,812
Jack the Ripper!

84
00:06:36,013 --> 00:06:37,605
Evil Lincoln!

85
00:06:39,293 --> 00:06:42,091
Right-O, gents.
It's another simulation gone mad.

86
00:06:42,253 --> 00:06:44,926
So murder and mayhem,
standard procedure.

87
00:06:49,533 --> 00:06:54,209
Real holographic-Simulated
Evil Lincoln is back!

88
00:07:02,333 --> 00:07:05,291
The Holo-Shed's on the fritz again.
The characters turned real!

89
00:07:05,493 --> 00:07:09,088
Damn! The last time that happened,
I got slapped with three paternity suits.

90
00:07:11,773 --> 00:07:15,004
Oh, my God!
Listen up, history's greatest villains.

91
00:07:15,173 --> 00:07:18,563
Get back into the Holo-Shed
before I start blasting.

92
00:07:18,933 --> 00:07:22,130
Stop!
No shoot fire-Stick in space canoe!

93
00:07:22,293 --> 00:07:24,648
Cause explosive decompression!

94
00:07:24,853 --> 00:07:28,607
Spare me your space-Age techno-Babble,
Attila the Hun.

95
00:07:39,293 --> 00:07:40,772
Oh .

96
00:07:40,933 --> 00:07:42,412
Hey!

97
00:07:45,813 --> 00:07:48,805
Kif, hold on!
I totally want to!

98
00:07:53,213 --> 00:07:55,010
Grab on!
Over here!

99
00:07:55,173 --> 00:07:56,686
Please, hold me!

100
00:07:57,453 --> 00:07:59,683
Have a good one.

101
00:08:04,653 --> 00:08:06,769
Oh, man!
Whew.

102
00:08:06,933 --> 00:08:09,242
After all that,
I could use some relaxation.

103
00:08:09,413 --> 00:08:11,369
I'll be in the Holo-Shed.

104
00:08:20,773 --> 00:08:24,607
Well, except for a few broken bones,
some internal hemorrhaging...

105
00:08:24,773 --> 00:08:28,083
And a partially barfed up heart,
everyone appears fine.

106
00:08:28,293 --> 00:08:29,362
Phew.

107
00:08:29,813 --> 00:08:31,724
Oh, and Kif is pregnant.

108
00:08:34,533 --> 00:08:36,728
Oh, joy!

109
00:08:42,533 --> 00:08:45,206
Amy, isn't it wonderful? I'm pregnant.

110
00:08:45,413 --> 00:08:48,962
Yes, it's great. A great miracle.

111
00:08:49,173 --> 00:08:52,165
And not one of those bogus
everyday miracles, like a sunrise.

112
00:08:52,333 --> 00:08:54,289
Aren't you a male?
Yeah, what's the deal?

113
00:08:54,453 --> 00:08:58,366
Just when I thought I'd figured out you
biological creatures, it's something else!

114
00:08:58,573 --> 00:09:02,691
Let me at him! Get over here, Kif!
You're--

115
00:09:02,893 --> 00:09:06,602
Look, I'm sure we're all a little
unclear on how anyone gets pregnant.

116
00:09:06,773 --> 00:09:11,449
So, Kif, pray explain, and don't spare
the dirty words where appropriate.

117
00:09:11,653 --> 00:09:13,405
Well, it's quite simple really.

118
00:09:13,573 --> 00:09:16,645
When one of my species experiences
deep feelings of love...

119
00:09:16,813 --> 00:09:19,646
We enter a so-Called "receptive state. "

120
00:09:19,853 --> 00:09:22,048
You disgust me. Go on.

121
00:09:22,253 --> 00:09:25,723
At that point, our skin becomes
a semipermeable membrane...

122
00:09:25,893 --> 00:09:28,771
Which allows the passage
of genetic material.

123
00:09:28,933 --> 00:09:31,970
I held Amy's hand, and voilà!

124
00:09:32,173 --> 00:09:35,370
Well, okay.
But that better be all there is.

125
00:09:35,613 --> 00:09:39,162
Oh, Amy, you'll be a mother!

126
00:09:43,573 --> 00:09:48,408
What a wondrous affirmation of our love.
And all from the touch of your hand.

127
00:09:48,653 --> 00:09:51,326
Dude, hold up. Remember when
Zapp blew a hole in the ship?

128
00:09:51,493 --> 00:09:53,848
Indeed.
Kif touched everybody there.

129
00:09:54,053 --> 00:09:56,772
Couldn't any one of us be the mother?
Hey, yeah!

130
00:09:56,933 --> 00:09:58,571
I mean, what about that, Kif?

131
00:09:58,733 --> 00:10:01,372
Well, I suppose I might have
gotten pregnant that way.

132
00:10:01,533 --> 00:10:03,251
Or even from a toilet seat.

133
00:10:03,413 --> 00:10:06,962
Though, that's impossible,
since I have a private washroom.

134
00:10:08,333 --> 00:10:09,846
My home away from home.

135
00:10:10,053 --> 00:10:14,205
By the way, Kif, your flush
seems to be set on stun, not kill.

136
00:10:17,653 --> 00:10:21,202
Look, Kif, I probably am the mother.
Although maybe I'm not.

137
00:10:21,373 --> 00:10:25,969
Of course, I hope I am, but just in case
I'm not, maybe we should have a test.

138
00:10:26,173 --> 00:10:28,926
A test! I demand a test!

139
00:10:32,893 --> 00:10:38,013
Even I laughed at me when I built this
alien cross-Species genetic analyzer.

140
00:10:38,213 --> 00:10:40,249
But I guess I showed myself.

141
00:10:40,493 --> 00:10:43,291
Subjects, please enter the chamber.

142
00:10:48,053 --> 00:10:51,682
Now to take a DNA sample.

143
00:10:58,773 --> 00:11:03,528
When I pull this switch, the
materni-Fuge will spin at 10,000 rpm...

144
00:11:03,693 --> 00:11:06,924
Separating out everyone
who isn't the mother--

145
00:11:07,093 --> 00:11:10,051
Father-- Whatever.

146
00:11:16,133 --> 00:11:17,407
Faster! Faster!

147
00:11:26,173 --> 00:11:30,485
Good! Fry's ejection indicates
that he is not the man mama.

148
00:11:34,013 --> 00:11:37,289
Nor is Captain Brannigan.
Oh, thank you, merciful God.

149
00:11:39,493 --> 00:11:43,008
Zoidberg? What the hell
were you doing in there?

150
00:11:43,213 --> 00:11:46,205
That's where I live. I have no home.

151
00:11:54,133 --> 00:11:56,089
Amy? But that means...

152
00:12:03,733 --> 00:12:07,043
Leela must have impregnated me
when she grabbed my ungloved hand.

153
00:12:07,213 --> 00:12:11,286
That explains the poster in hygiene class:
"No glove, no love. "

154
00:12:11,493 --> 00:12:15,884
Wow, this is all so confusing.
Leela, how could you?

155
00:12:16,093 --> 00:12:19,529
Our love has had to endure your
constant hatred, and now this?

156
00:12:19,693 --> 00:12:23,845
Stop testing our love!
Oh, please, captain.

157
00:12:24,053 --> 00:12:27,887
I thank Leela for the DNA she
gave me, but in my species...

158
00:12:28,093 --> 00:12:31,688
The true parent is the one who
inspired the initial feeling of love.

159
00:12:32,013 --> 00:12:37,531
We call that person the "Smizmarr. "
And my Smizmarr is Amy.

160
00:12:37,733 --> 00:12:40,691
So the toilet seat is like
the uncle or something?

161
00:12:42,813 --> 00:12:45,646
Sorry I got your boyfriend pregnant.
That's okay.

162
00:12:45,813 --> 00:12:48,281
At least Kif's baby
shower should be fun.

163
00:12:48,493 --> 00:12:50,290
I better put it on my calendar.

164
00:12:51,053 --> 00:12:53,931
Thursday. Baby shower. Enter.

165
00:12:54,853 --> 00:12:57,242
Might as well plan for my
new life while I'm at it.

166
00:12:57,413 --> 00:12:59,529
Set motherhood mode.

167
00:13:07,013 --> 00:13:09,049
To motherhood.

168
00:13:15,733 --> 00:13:17,212
Zoidberg?

169
00:13:18,813 --> 00:13:20,531
My face was stuck in a pizza.

170
00:13:20,693 --> 00:13:24,322
Mom? Dad? I know this is weird, but--
Yeah, yeah.

171
00:13:24,493 --> 00:13:26,723
We don't care how squishy
alien get pregnant.

172
00:13:26,933 --> 00:13:28,764
All we care is that we have grandchild.

173
00:13:28,973 --> 00:13:32,648
You're very open-Minded, Mrs. Wong.
Hey, you call her "Grandma" now.

174
00:13:32,813 --> 00:13:34,883
Call me Grandma like crazy.
All the time.

175
00:13:35,533 --> 00:13:38,252
Check it out, y'all.
Everyone we invited is here.

176
00:13:38,453 --> 00:13:41,092
Also Zoidberg.
So let's open the gifts.

177
00:13:41,293 --> 00:13:43,443
Yeah!
I can't wait.

178
00:13:43,613 --> 00:13:46,207
We'll start with this one from Bender.

179
00:13:50,293 --> 00:13:52,568
It's my booties from when I was a kid.

180
00:13:52,773 --> 00:13:56,129
Uh, they're already bronzed.
They are bronze.

181
00:13:56,333 --> 00:14:00,485
And this one's from Leela.
Oh, I just love the bow.

182
00:14:00,653 --> 00:14:04,532
I wonder what it is.
Yes, I wonder what we got you.

183
00:14:06,653 --> 00:14:10,612
It's a basket! For picnics?
It means a lot to me.

184
00:14:10,773 --> 00:14:13,845
It's the basket my parents
left me in at the Orphanarium.

185
00:14:14,013 --> 00:14:15,810
You could use it for picnics.

186
00:14:16,013 --> 00:14:19,892
Here, Amy, we get this one for you.
Is it a new party board?

187
00:14:21,413 --> 00:14:24,485
It's a board, all right.
An ironing board.

188
00:14:24,653 --> 00:14:28,328
We had your old party board converted
now that you not be partying anymore.

189
00:14:28,493 --> 00:14:32,645
You trashed my party board?
Damn right. Now you a mom.

190
00:14:32,813 --> 00:14:36,692
The only surfing you'll do is
under a big wave of responsibility.

191
00:14:36,893 --> 00:14:40,010
Oh, this is the happiest
moment of my life.

192
00:14:40,173 --> 00:14:42,528
You all brought such wonderful gifts.

193
00:14:42,693 --> 00:14:44,763
But the greatest gift
Mine!

194
00:14:44,973 --> 00:14:47,931
Is the bond I share
with my Smizmarr, Amy.

195
00:14:48,093 --> 00:14:53,008
For soon, the quivering mass of life
within me will depend upon us both.

196
00:14:53,173 --> 00:14:58,770
Even now, I can sense it feeding,
squirming, searching, questing.

197
00:14:58,933 --> 00:15:02,164
And shortly, it will
rend my loins in twain...

198
00:15:02,333 --> 00:15:05,723
Burst forth and pull us
down, down, down...

199
00:15:05,893 --> 00:15:08,532
Into the deep, dark
waters of commitment.

200
00:15:08,733 --> 00:15:12,169
That's so beautiful.

201
00:15:12,373 --> 00:15:15,649
Yes, it's .

202
00:15:15,813 --> 00:15:18,850
No! I can't do this!

203
00:15:20,373 --> 00:15:22,204
Oh, my God!

204
00:15:32,213 --> 00:15:34,204
Oh, how could Amy leave me?

205
00:15:34,413 --> 00:15:36,563
When will women learn
to take responsibility...

206
00:15:36,733 --> 00:15:39,042
For the children they've helped create?

207
00:15:40,453 --> 00:15:42,683
The quickening! My time is near.

208
00:15:42,893 --> 00:15:46,408
I must return to my home world to
perform the ancient birthing rights.

209
00:15:46,613 --> 00:15:48,843
Let me know how that turns out.

210
00:16:08,413 --> 00:16:10,608
I must now embark on
a perilous journey...

211
00:16:10,773 --> 00:16:14,322
To give birth in precisely the
same swamp in which I was born.

212
00:16:14,533 --> 00:16:16,683
If it's so dangerous,
I'd better go with you.

213
00:16:16,853 --> 00:16:19,321
A gal has to protect her DNA.
No, Leela.

214
00:16:19,493 --> 00:16:22,724
Tradition demands that I make
this journey with my Smizmarr.

215
00:16:22,893 --> 00:16:26,681
And since Amy isn't here,
I must go it alone.

216
00:16:26,853 --> 00:16:30,528
Farewell, for we may never meet again.

217
00:16:35,613 --> 00:16:38,286
My scrapes feel a little better now.

218
00:16:41,293 --> 00:16:46,208
Hey, what's this fat, ugly thing?
A frog? A toad? Or your mama?

219
00:16:50,973 --> 00:16:53,885
It's a poisonous froad! No one move.

220
00:16:59,613 --> 00:17:01,285
I'm back, baby.

221
00:17:10,173 --> 00:17:11,447
Behold.

222
00:17:11,653 --> 00:17:15,771
The sacred ancestral
birthing grounds of my family.

223
00:17:15,933 --> 00:17:17,525
Smells like a jockstrap.

224
00:17:22,213 --> 00:17:25,649
I am the Grand Midwife.
Hi.

225
00:17:25,853 --> 00:17:29,243
I am Kif, of the clan Kroker,
come to bear my young.

226
00:17:29,413 --> 00:17:34,203
Then let the tea of new life
be brewed, as it is writ:

227
00:17:34,373 --> 00:17:37,763
"And both shall lift the jug together. "

228
00:17:37,933 --> 00:17:40,970
Where is your Smizmarr?
She's not with me.

229
00:17:41,173 --> 00:17:45,166
Oh, the sorrow! Oh, the shame!

230
00:17:45,373 --> 00:17:47,603
Sorry, I'm probably just
making you feel worse.

231
00:17:47,813 --> 00:17:52,170
As long as Amy is with me in my heart,
I will have the strength of two.

232
00:17:56,973 --> 00:18:00,648
Apparently Amy hasn't been
working out much lately.

233
00:18:05,733 --> 00:18:10,523
As the tea boils, please join
hands with your beloved Smizmarr.

234
00:18:12,013 --> 00:18:16,325
Oh, right. Sorry, but I've memorized the
ceremony by rote. It mentions her a lot.

235
00:18:16,533 --> 00:18:18,888
I'll try to endure.
Good, 'cause I'm not changing it.

236
00:18:19,093 --> 00:18:24,121
Now turn, ye two, and gaze
deeply into each other's eyes.

237
00:18:25,333 --> 00:18:28,245
What are you looking at?
May the love I sense between you...

238
00:18:28,413 --> 00:18:32,929
At this moment remain with
you both through all your days.

239
00:18:36,253 --> 00:18:38,483
The tea of new life is ready.

240
00:18:38,693 --> 00:18:44,131
Let those whose love created this life
speak each other's names, then drink.

241
00:18:49,693 --> 00:18:52,002
Amy.
Kif!

242
00:18:55,133 --> 00:18:59,285
Amy! Is it you, or have
I gone crazy with loneliness?

243
00:18:59,493 --> 00:19:00,892
Both.

244
00:19:02,053 --> 00:19:03,452
Whoa!

245
00:19:03,813 --> 00:19:07,522
I still don't know if I'm ready for this,
but I do know I love you.

246
00:19:07,693 --> 00:19:09,570
And I want to be here beside you.

247
00:19:09,773 --> 00:19:12,606
Great. Now I lost my place.
I'm starting over!

248
00:19:13,253 --> 00:19:15,403
Oh, no time. It has begun.

249
00:19:19,413 --> 00:19:20,641
Oh, my!

250
00:19:26,453 --> 00:19:29,047
Neat.
You can do it, Kif.

251
00:19:30,893 --> 00:19:32,645
Whoa, Nelly!

252
00:19:43,653 --> 00:19:45,723
Oh, man!

253
00:19:50,533 --> 00:19:54,367
Amy, my love, tell me,
are they making it to the water?

254
00:19:59,893 --> 00:20:00,928
Amy!

255
00:20:01,853 --> 00:20:04,208
Stay away from my babies!

256
00:20:14,253 --> 00:20:16,687
The birthing is complete.

257
00:20:17,973 --> 00:20:21,409
Oh, thank goodness.
I will now take my leave.

258
00:20:21,613 --> 00:20:24,286
I live here, so I won't
actually be going anywhere...

259
00:20:24,453 --> 00:20:27,013
But you don't have
to talk to me anymore.

260
00:20:27,413 --> 00:20:29,927
Congratulations.
Way to go, squishy!

261
00:20:32,373 --> 00:20:33,931
There goes my DNA.

262
00:20:34,133 --> 00:20:38,172
What a disgusting and beautiful process.
That's birth for you.

263
00:20:38,373 --> 00:20:40,523
Well, we've given them
a great start, Amy.

264
00:20:40,693 --> 00:20:46,165
And in 20 years, they'll sprout legs
and crawl back onto land as children.

265
00:20:46,333 --> 00:20:48,563
I'll be ready then.
