1
00:00:07,373 --> 00:00:09,443
The Cryonic Woman

2
00:00:37,333 --> 00:00:42,282
Giant space robot, this is Captain Fry
of the USS Planet Express ship.

3
00:00:42,533 --> 00:00:43,602
We come in peace.

4
00:00:43,853 --> 00:00:45,366
Tough luck!

5
00:00:56,373 --> 00:00:59,888
We destroyed the toy spaceship.
Now what?

6
00:01:00,093 --> 00:01:02,971
-The keys to the real spaceship!
-Think we should?

7
00:01:03,253 --> 00:01:05,209
Yes, I do.

8
00:01:09,973 --> 00:01:12,646
Have you seen the keys
to the spaceship?

9
00:01:13,253 --> 00:01:14,686
I left them onboard.

10
00:01:15,613 --> 00:01:16,807
I mean, what?!

11
00:01:17,053 --> 00:01:19,009
Relax. The ship won't go anywhere.

12
00:01:19,253 --> 00:01:22,211
I anchored it with the unbreakable
diamond tether.

13
00:02:00,453 --> 00:02:02,967
Hey, Fry! I'm steering with my ass!

14
00:02:03,213 --> 00:02:04,931
The best thing I ever saw!

15
00:02:24,853 --> 00:02:28,562
-That was great!
-And no one suspects a thing!

16
00:02:35,813 --> 00:02:38,691
And that's how we learned our lesson.

17
00:02:39,053 --> 00:02:42,204
You've gone too far this time.
All three of you!

18
00:02:42,413 --> 00:02:44,973
-What did I do?
-You left the keys!

19
00:02:45,213 --> 00:02:48,603
Look at them. Wasn't it obvious
what would happen?

20
00:02:48,853 --> 00:02:52,004
-Yeah, Leela.
-We're very disappointed in you.

21
00:02:52,253 --> 00:02:54,483
I should fire you three right now. . .

22
00:02:54,693 --> 00:02:57,571
. . .but I'm just not that cold-hearted.

23
00:02:58,613 --> 00:03:00,171
You're all fired!

24
00:03:02,093 --> 00:03:05,369
Goodbye, friends. I'll miss you.

25
00:03:06,053 --> 00:03:09,204
Good riddance!
Now Zoidberg is the popular one!

26
00:03:09,453 --> 00:03:12,968
Yes! Let's all talk to Zoidberg.

27
00:03:13,173 --> 00:03:16,006
So, Zoidberg, what's new?

28
00:03:16,253 --> 00:03:17,971
Oh, you know. . . .

29
00:03:18,933 --> 00:03:23,290
What about money? All I've got
is my first mustache. . .

30
00:03:23,493 --> 00:03:26,246
. . .and a picture of my
old girlfriend, Michelle. . .

31
00:03:26,453 --> 00:03:29,126
. . .and that ski instructor
who's just her friend.

32
00:03:29,333 --> 00:03:30,527
Pardon me, brother.

33
00:03:30,733 --> 00:03:33,770
Care to donate
to the anti-mugging-you fund?

34
00:03:34,013 --> 00:03:37,164
We don't need to beg.
We're not veterans.

35
00:03:37,413 --> 00:03:38,482
What do you suggest?

36
00:03:38,693 --> 00:03:43,483
A robbery of Fort Knox on elephant
back? Dumbest thing I ever heard.

37
00:03:43,693 --> 00:03:47,083
-No. We can get jobs.
-But we just had jobs!

38
00:03:47,293 --> 00:03:49,648
I still have our old career chips.

39
00:03:49,853 --> 00:03:51,684
-Our what?
-Career chips.

40
00:03:51,893 --> 00:03:55,363
Remember? They assign you the job
you're best at.

41
00:03:55,893 --> 00:03:58,361
I tried to give you one
and you ran away?

42
00:03:58,853 --> 00:04:01,162
-It's how we met?
-Then what happened?

43
00:04:01,733 --> 00:04:03,564
Just give me your hand.

44
00:04:04,853 --> 00:04:06,172
Baby.

45
00:04:09,253 --> 00:04:13,724
I'd like my old job counseling
defrostees and assigning them careers.

46
00:04:13,933 --> 00:04:16,208
I was hoping you'd come back.

47
00:04:16,453 --> 00:04:20,082
I even saved your poster of a chimp
expressing your distaste for Mondays.

48
00:04:20,293 --> 00:04:22,363
He lives for the weekend.

49
00:04:22,573 --> 00:04:26,771
Put your hand under the scanner
so I can verify your career chip.

50
00:04:27,253 --> 00:04:29,369
Calcutta, we have a problem.

51
00:04:29,573 --> 00:04:32,690
Delivery boy?
I must have mixed up the chips.

52
00:04:32,893 --> 00:04:36,249
Here's our cryogenic counselor!
Do you like Mondays?

53
00:04:36,453 --> 00:04:38,967
-They're okay.
-Then we'll redecorate your office.

54
00:04:39,213 --> 00:04:43,286
How do you feel about it helping
to be crazy to work here?

55
00:04:43,493 --> 00:04:45,165
Let's see what it says about me!

56
00:04:46,853 --> 00:04:48,252
Welcome aboard, sir!

57
00:04:50,013 --> 00:04:52,322
Remember, when the tube opens, say:

58
00:04:52,533 --> 00:04:56,242
"Welcome to the world of tomorrow! "

59
00:04:56,453 --> 00:05:00,765
I was frozen. I think I know
what defrostees want to hear.

60
00:05:02,333 --> 00:05:03,971
Bathroom's that way.

61
00:05:04,653 --> 00:05:07,406
Tell me what brings you to the future.

62
00:05:07,613 --> 00:05:10,923
I wanted to meet Shakespeare
and I figured time was cyclical.

63
00:05:11,133 --> 00:05:13,089
Nope. Straight line.

64
00:05:13,333 --> 00:05:16,131
-The probulator's done.
-That wasn't so bad.

65
00:05:16,333 --> 00:05:18,767
Oh, wait, it hasn't started yet.

66
00:05:21,853 --> 00:05:24,162
Okay, it's about to start.

67
00:05:29,973 --> 00:05:33,568
Welcome to the future, human slave!

68
00:05:35,053 --> 00:05:38,568
Relax, chum.
I'm not really a giant fly.

69
00:05:38,813 --> 00:05:41,850
I'm a horrible robot!

70
00:05:43,293 --> 00:05:45,363
Kill all humans!

71
00:05:47,453 --> 00:05:49,683
He's having a heart attack!

72
00:05:51,773 --> 00:05:55,652
-They'll find a cure in the future.
-We have a cure now!

73
00:05:55,853 --> 00:05:58,765
Good. Then you won't mind
if I use this.

74
00:06:06,213 --> 00:06:08,249
Nothing like a power nap.

75
00:06:15,053 --> 00:06:18,170
Oh, flies, flies and gorillas!

76
00:06:22,413 --> 00:06:24,483
Stay beautiful, doll-face!

77
00:06:25,453 --> 00:06:29,969
That probulator sure knows how to
please a man! So, what's for lunch?

78
00:06:30,173 --> 00:06:31,891
I ordered a pizza.

79
00:06:32,133 --> 00:06:33,566
Pizza delivery for. . .

80
00:06:34,133 --> 00:06:35,168
. . .I.C. Wiener.

81
00:06:36,413 --> 00:06:39,485
Very funny. Now cough up the $1 2.95.

82
00:06:39,693 --> 00:06:43,925
-After half an hour, it's free.
-It's only been 23 minutes.

83
00:06:44,133 --> 00:06:46,010
Well, I've got 33 minutes.

84
00:06:47,413 --> 00:06:49,973
It's only been 23 minutes,
you dumb cannoli!

85
00:06:50,173 --> 00:06:52,767
You got a problem,
let's take it outside!

86
00:06:52,973 --> 00:06:55,328
Okay. I'll fight the box.
I can take him.

87
00:06:55,533 --> 00:06:58,809
Just pay me. I owe 30 bucks
on this uniform.

88
00:06:59,053 --> 00:07:02,011
Thirty five, you stupid meatball!

89
00:07:03,333 --> 00:07:04,891
Who should we unfreeze next?

90
00:07:05,453 --> 00:07:08,092
No. No!

91
00:07:08,333 --> 00:07:10,893
Oh, my God, it's Pauly Shore!

92
00:07:11,093 --> 00:07:12,765
All right!

93
00:07:13,653 --> 00:07:18,204
I loved you in Bio-Dome.
You sure made trouble in that bubble.

94
00:07:18,413 --> 00:07:21,485
If it rhymes,
I can cause trouble in it.

95
00:07:21,693 --> 00:07:25,208
Now that you're in the future,
you can live in an actual bio-dome.

96
00:07:25,453 --> 00:07:26,806
An unattractive prospect.

97
00:07:27,053 --> 00:07:31,365
While researching for the role, I ran
computer simulations demonstrating. . .

98
00:07:31,613 --> 00:07:34,889
. . .that the whole concept
is fundamentally flawed.

99
00:07:35,133 --> 00:07:38,091
Be it expressed via dome,
sphere, cube. . .

100
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:42,372
. . .or even the stately tetrahedron,
buddy.

101
00:07:45,733 --> 00:07:47,644
So how did you wind up
getting frozen?

102
00:07:48,053 --> 00:07:53,366
During Encino Man, my intellectual
curiosity re: cryogenics was peaked.

103
00:07:53,573 --> 00:07:55,768
I resolved to freeze the weasel.

104
00:07:55,973 --> 00:07:57,964
The weasel!

105
00:07:58,733 --> 00:08:01,201
I was supposed to be unfrozen. . .

106
00:08:01,413 --> 00:08:04,962
. . .for the 1 000th anniversary
screening of Jury Duty ll.

107
00:08:05,173 --> 00:08:06,447
How come I'm not there?

108
00:08:06,653 --> 00:08:08,609
I woke you up early to hang out
and do stuff.

109
00:08:08,813 --> 00:08:10,371
Like what?

110
00:08:14,653 --> 00:08:17,372
-I love this job.
-Me too!

111
00:08:17,573 --> 00:08:18,608
Showtime.

112
00:08:18,853 --> 00:08:21,572
I'll pretend to be dying
of space plague.

113
00:08:26,013 --> 00:08:27,048
Michelle?

114
00:08:27,333 --> 00:08:29,608
Oh, my God!

115
00:08:31,133 --> 00:08:33,249
Fry? ls it really you?

116
00:08:33,453 --> 00:08:35,523
I don't know. Is it really you?

117
00:08:35,733 --> 00:08:38,201
What do you mean?
Are you you, or not?

118
00:08:38,413 --> 00:08:42,167
-Who wants to know?
-Oh, Fry, it is you!

119
00:08:49,613 --> 00:08:53,242
Last time I saw you,
you were doing great.

120
00:08:53,453 --> 00:08:56,650
You dumped me, and your life
was back on track.

121
00:08:56,853 --> 00:08:59,003
-Why'd you freeze yourself?
-Oh, Fry.

122
00:08:59,253 --> 00:09:02,962
After you left, things got worse.
I got married.

123
00:09:03,173 --> 00:09:04,322
I'm sorry.

124
00:09:05,413 --> 00:09:07,005
His name was Charles.

125
00:09:07,253 --> 00:09:10,802
His law school was so prestigious,
the basketball coach...

126
00:09:11,013 --> 00:09:13,368
... was Ruth Bader Ginsburg.

127
00:09:14,653 --> 00:09:18,805
I put him through school
by working with antisocial dogs.

128
00:09:19,493 --> 00:09:24,567
But soon after Charles graduated,
our marriage ran into difficulties.

129
00:09:26,813 --> 00:09:27,802
Sorry.

130
00:09:28,013 --> 00:09:31,972
I turned to the one thing
able to lessen my pain:

131
00:09:32,173 --> 00:09:33,572
A carnival.

132
00:09:33,773 --> 00:09:37,971
But a corn dog bone got lodged
in the control of the Spizzler...

133
00:09:38,213 --> 00:09:41,011
...and I had to ride it
for 8 hours.

134
00:09:41,253 --> 00:09:43,926
But it did give me a chance to think.

135
00:09:44,773 --> 00:09:49,130
I remembered the last time I was
truly happy. When I was with you.

136
00:09:49,333 --> 00:09:52,370
So you froze yourself
to come look for me?

137
00:09:52,573 --> 00:09:57,044
No. I did it for a fresh start.
I didn't know what happened to you.

138
00:09:57,253 --> 00:10:01,610
The police searched but your parents
felt it was a waste of money.

139
00:10:01,853 --> 00:10:05,892
Same reason they kept me out
of school. No one cared I was gone?

140
00:10:06,093 --> 00:10:09,563
Not really. Except for one person.

141
00:10:11,853 --> 00:10:12,922
Who was it?

142
00:10:16,053 --> 00:10:18,169
Everything is so different!

143
00:10:18,373 --> 00:10:21,365
Not everything.
There's still a roach problem.

144
00:10:30,533 --> 00:10:33,809
Now people like art
that's tattooed on fat guys.

145
00:10:34,053 --> 00:10:35,884
I'm on loan from the Louvre.

146
00:10:48,053 --> 00:10:49,532
Please, professor.

147
00:10:49,733 --> 00:10:52,088
We deserve another chance.

148
00:10:52,333 --> 00:10:56,804
And if you won't give me another
chance, perhaps you'd give one to. . .

149
00:10:57,133 --> 00:10:59,886
. . .Og, gorilla emperor of Earth!

150
00:11:01,053 --> 00:11:03,521
Sorry, Og. But I've got a new crew.

151
00:11:03,973 --> 00:11:06,771
How was your delivery
to Fantasy Planet. . .

152
00:11:06,973 --> 00:11:09,533
. . .where everyone's fantasies
come to life?

153
00:11:09,733 --> 00:11:11,132
-Great!
-Organized!

154
00:11:11,333 --> 00:11:15,770
For one beautiful night, I knew
what it was to be a grandmother.

155
00:11:15,973 --> 00:11:17,850
Subjugated, yet honored.

156
00:11:18,053 --> 00:11:21,284
You see, Og?
Everything's running smoothly.

157
00:11:21,493 --> 00:11:26,726
With Fry fired, I can leave my jigsaw
puzzles out. He won't eat the pieces.

158
00:11:26,933 --> 00:11:30,403
Forget about Fry. Hire us back.
He'll never know.

159
00:11:30,653 --> 00:11:31,972
Hey, guys!

160
00:11:32,413 --> 00:11:33,402
Hey, Fry!

161
00:11:33,613 --> 00:11:37,492
So, as Leela was saying,
Fry can go shove a big, old--

162
00:11:37,693 --> 00:11:38,682
I'm glad you're all here.

163
00:11:38,893 --> 00:11:43,409
Here's my ex-girlfriend of the past
1 000 years, Michelle.

164
00:11:45,413 --> 00:11:46,892
Michelle, this is Leela.

165
00:11:47,853 --> 00:11:48,808
This is Bender.

166
00:11:49,573 --> 00:11:50,688
The professor.

167
00:11:53,253 --> 00:11:55,369
-Hermes and Amy.
-Nice to meet you.

168
00:11:55,573 --> 00:11:57,325
And this is Dr. Zoidberg.

169
00:12:00,253 --> 00:12:01,606
Dating your ex, Fry?

170
00:12:01,813 --> 00:12:04,646
-Have you lost all self-respect?
-All what?

171
00:12:04,853 --> 00:12:10,211
-It can end badly. Kids, a house. . . .
-Home invasion by an old roommate.

172
00:12:10,453 --> 00:12:13,889
It's different now.
She was demanding and possessive.

173
00:12:14,133 --> 00:12:17,045
Now she wants me to do stuff,
be with her.

174
00:12:18,813 --> 00:12:21,566
There you go, dearies.

175
00:12:23,773 --> 00:12:25,411
It's a relief to meet you, Amy.

176
00:12:25,653 --> 00:12:29,885
It's hard adjusting to all the strange
stuff of the future.

177
00:12:30,133 --> 00:12:32,169
I'm from Mars.

178
00:12:32,413 --> 00:12:37,043
I feel so out of place. I don't
understand why Fry fits in so well.

179
00:12:37,253 --> 00:12:39,448
Because he didn't in your time.

180
00:12:39,653 --> 00:12:42,565
True. But I used to fit in
really well.

181
00:12:42,773 --> 00:12:44,968
Then good luck, sister.

182
00:12:51,653 --> 00:12:53,484
Don 't take this the wrong way.

183
00:12:53,733 --> 00:12:56,770
-Your friends are freaks.
-Great, huh?

184
00:12:56,973 --> 00:12:59,362
I don't belong.
I don't know anyone.

185
00:12:59,573 --> 00:13:03,361
I can't find vanishing cream that
won't make me really vanish.

186
00:13:03,573 --> 00:13:07,009
-I don't have a job.
-I'm supposed to assign you one.

187
00:13:07,253 --> 00:13:11,212
I'll get your career chip installed.
Hold out your palm.

188
00:13:11,413 --> 00:13:13,802
It's like getting
your hand pierced.

189
00:13:14,013 --> 00:13:15,810
This world is horrible.

190
00:13:16,053 --> 00:13:19,602
Let's go where all we have
is each other.

191
00:13:19,813 --> 00:13:22,611
Romantic.
I'll tell Bender to meet us there.

192
00:13:22,813 --> 00:13:27,125
It's not a "there. " It's a then.
The future.

193
00:13:27,333 --> 00:13:31,804
I thought you meant a motel where
the bed is shaped like stuff.

194
00:13:32,013 --> 00:13:34,527
I love you. Don't you love me?

195
00:13:34,733 --> 00:13:39,204
Sure. To the extent a man can love
a woman. But this is a big step.

196
00:13:39,413 --> 00:13:43,486
Why must you analyze everything
with your relentless logic?

197
00:13:43,733 --> 00:13:46,247
Nothing matters but our love.

198
00:13:46,453 --> 00:13:50,002
You're right. Let's do this now
and never regret it.

199
00:14:07,453 --> 00:14:11,241
Michelle, I don't regret this.
But I rue and lament it.

200
00:14:15,893 --> 00:14:18,009
The year 4000 is disappointing.

201
00:14:18,253 --> 00:14:23,008
I miss 3000 when brains flew
through space and people ate lasers.

202
00:14:23,253 --> 00:14:27,212
It's not so bad. Fate brought
us together and brought us here.

203
00:14:27,413 --> 00:14:28,846
You brought us here.

204
00:14:29,053 --> 00:14:32,204
Whine some more.
It's really attractive.

205
00:14:32,453 --> 00:14:34,364
Now, build us a shelter.

206
00:14:34,573 --> 00:14:39,363
Fine. Everything else sucks. At least
we'll have a nice place to live.

207
00:14:43,453 --> 00:14:46,365
-There!
-You expect me to live in a hole?

208
00:14:46,573 --> 00:14:49,770
It'd be deeper,
but I'm standing on a gopher.

209
00:14:58,253 --> 00:15:01,882
-Oh, look. Some little kids!
-They'll save us!

210
00:15:04,053 --> 00:15:05,372
We're saved!

211
00:15:11,133 --> 00:15:13,727
I'm Butch, leader of this place!

212
00:15:13,933 --> 00:15:17,005
I took your hole.
You can't do nothing about it!

213
00:15:18,013 --> 00:15:22,165
Sir, we have nowhere to go.
Could we please join your society?

214
00:15:22,373 --> 00:15:26,207
All right. But no interfering
with our grand works.

215
00:15:32,933 --> 00:15:37,609
Butch runs a good civilization.
I'll enjoy serving under him.

216
00:15:37,853 --> 00:15:40,925
You know your problem?
You're not ambitious.

217
00:15:41,133 --> 00:15:42,532
You should be chief.

218
00:15:42,733 --> 00:15:44,132
What do I need, ulcers?

219
00:15:44,333 --> 00:15:47,803
I want power. I'm tired
of the chief's girlfriend. . .

220
00:15:48,013 --> 00:15:51,164
. . .Iording it over me
with her fancy coyote hide.

221
00:15:51,733 --> 00:15:56,568
All right. If it'll make you happy,
I'll overthrow society.

222
00:15:58,053 --> 00:16:01,932
On what grounds do you challenge
my authority?

223
00:16:02,133 --> 00:16:04,044
I'm older. I can beat you up.

224
00:16:04,253 --> 00:16:06,813
-I'll bet he could.
-He's got arm hair.

225
00:16:07,013 --> 00:16:10,801
All right, Grandpa. There's only
one way to settle this.

226
00:16:11,053 --> 00:16:13,362
Death rolling.

227
00:16:15,893 --> 00:16:18,009
-What?
-It's like skateboarding.

228
00:16:18,253 --> 00:16:23,771
-Except half the time, someone dies.
-So it's safer than skateboarding.

229
00:16:28,373 --> 00:16:32,571
Last one holding the bandanna
is the new leader.

230
00:16:33,013 --> 00:16:35,573
My mother always said
you were a loser.

231
00:16:35,813 --> 00:16:39,442
-Now go prove her wrong!
-Beth said that?

232
00:17:27,733 --> 00:17:29,689
It's cool. Back off!

233
00:17:30,653 --> 00:17:33,770
My knee! I scraped it!

234
00:17:35,173 --> 00:17:38,961
Poor little guy.
Let me just take a look at--

235
00:17:39,173 --> 00:17:43,052
I won! I'm the new chief!
I'm the tallest and I weigh the most!

236
00:17:43,253 --> 00:17:45,369
Hand it over, you giant idiot!

237
00:17:48,213 --> 00:17:50,966
-Butch, your mom's here!
-Ah, man!

238
00:17:51,173 --> 00:17:53,562
Come on, kids!
You're late for Hebrew school!

239
00:17:54,053 --> 00:17:55,008
I don't wanna go.

240
00:17:55,253 --> 00:17:58,563
Every Monday and Wednesday's
the same thing.

241
00:18:03,133 --> 00:18:06,205
This post-apocalyptic wasteland
is very confusing.

242
00:18:06,453 --> 00:18:10,082
-Seriously, I'm weirded out.
-That's because you're a loser.

243
00:18:10,333 --> 00:18:14,645
You were a loser in the year 2000,
you're a loser in the year 4000.

244
00:18:14,853 --> 00:18:17,003
But in 3000, I had it all.

245
00:18:17,253 --> 00:18:20,962
Friends, a low-paying job,
a bed in a robot's closet!

246
00:18:21,173 --> 00:18:24,449
I envied no man!
But you wrecked everything!

247
00:18:24,653 --> 00:18:27,451
Quit standing up for yourself, Fry!

248
00:18:27,653 --> 00:18:32,408
Back at the hole, we'll have a boring
talk about our relationship!

249
00:18:32,613 --> 00:18:34,524
Oh, yeah? Listen to this!

250
00:18:35,413 --> 00:18:37,165
I'm leaving you.

251
00:18:49,133 --> 00:18:51,966
There must be people somewhere.

252
00:19:18,413 --> 00:19:20,483
Yes! Footprints!

253
00:19:20,733 --> 00:19:22,564
And handprints?

254
00:19:25,453 --> 00:19:27,569
But what's happening?

255
00:19:33,933 --> 00:19:36,049
Fry, thank God we found you!

256
00:19:36,253 --> 00:19:39,051
What are you guys doing
in the year 4000?

257
00:19:39,253 --> 00:19:40,527
It's not 4000.

258
00:19:40,733 --> 00:19:44,362
You were only frozen for two days.
I broke your bed.

259
00:19:44,613 --> 00:19:50,006
You were in Pauly Shore's tube. They
delivered it to his movie screening.

260
00:19:50,213 --> 00:19:53,444
They noticed you weren't him
and threw you out.

261
00:19:53,653 --> 00:19:57,965
So these aren't the decaying ruins
of New York in 4000?

262
00:19:58,213 --> 00:20:02,604
-You wish. You're in Los Angeles!
-But there were kids with guns.

263
00:20:02,853 --> 00:20:04,684
Exactly. You're in L.A.

264
00:20:04,893 --> 00:20:08,124
-Everyone shoots at each other.
-That's L.A. !

265
00:20:08,333 --> 00:20:14,249
-There's no sign of civilization.
-Stop with the social commentary.

266
00:20:14,453 --> 00:20:18,765
The people are phony. No one reads.
Everything has cilantro on it--

267
00:20:20,573 --> 00:20:24,168
-Michelle, baby!
-It's not working out, Fry.

268
00:20:25,133 --> 00:20:28,967
Tis better to have loved and lost,
n 'est-ce pas?

269
00:20:33,053 --> 00:20:34,691
I've had it with women.

270
00:20:34,893 --> 00:20:38,886
I'm gonna concentrate on my career.
Can I have my job back?

271
00:20:39,093 --> 00:20:41,812
I've forgotten why I even fired you.

272
00:20:42,053 --> 00:20:45,568
He destroyed your business
and all your possessions.

273
00:20:45,773 --> 00:20:48,970
Oh, that's right. Get lost!

274
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,000
