1
00:00:07,173 --> 00:00:09,323
I Dated a Robot

2
00:00:31,813 --> 00:00:34,532
<i>You're entering a realm
which is unusual.</i>

3
00:00:34,733 --> 00:00:39,727
<i>Maybe it's magic or contains some
kind of monster. The second one.</i>

4
00:00:39,933 --> 00:00:44,051
<i>Prepare to enter The Scary Door.</i>

5
00:00:44,253 --> 00:00:47,450
<i>Please send the man round back
and pick up Clyde Smith...</i>

6
00:00:47,653 --> 00:00:52,329
<i>... a professional gambler who 's
about to have an unfortunate accident.</i>

7
00:01:00,653 --> 00:01:03,565
A casino where I'm winning?

8
00:01:03,733 --> 00:01:07,487
That car must have killed me.
I must be in heaven.

9
00:01:11,213 --> 00:01:13,443
A casino where I always win?

10
00:01:13,613 --> 00:01:17,208
That's boring.
I must really be... in hell!

11
00:01:17,413 --> 00:01:21,804
No. You're not in heaven or hell.
You're on an airplane.

12
00:01:23,973 --> 00:01:27,249
A gremlin's destroying the plane!
You've gotta believe me!

13
00:01:27,453 --> 00:01:30,763
Why should I believe you?
You're Hitler.

14
00:01:30,973 --> 00:01:34,170
Eva Braun, help me!

15
00:01:35,773 --> 00:01:38,970
- Saw it coming.
- I just saw something incredibly cool.

16
00:01:39,173 --> 00:01:42,563
A big floating ball that lit up with
every color in the rainbow...

17
00:01:42,813 --> 00:01:47,762
...plus some new ones that
were so beautiful I cried.

18
00:01:47,973 --> 00:01:50,692
- In front of Discount Shoe Outlet?
- Yeah.

19
00:01:50,853 --> 00:01:53,162
They have a kid wear that
to attract customers.

20
00:01:53,333 --> 00:01:56,166
I don't care if it was
a dork in a costume.

21
00:01:56,413 --> 00:02:01,407
For a moment, I felt the heartbeat of
creation, and it was one with my own.

22
00:02:01,613 --> 00:02:04,650
- Big deal.
- We all feel like that all the time.

23
00:02:04,893 --> 00:02:08,772
- You don't hear us gassing on about it.
- How can you be so blasé?

24
00:02:08,933 --> 00:02:13,768
It's the year 3000, yet you sit around
like it's the boring time I came from.

25
00:02:14,013 --> 00:02:17,767
Boring? Wasn't that the period when
they cracked the human genome...

26
00:02:17,933 --> 00:02:20,128
...and boy bands roamed the earth?

27
00:02:20,333 --> 00:02:22,528
Yeah. But now it's the distant future.

28
00:02:22,693 --> 00:02:25,366
Why aren't we doing
everything I ever dreamed of?

29
00:02:25,573 --> 00:02:29,122
- You know what might be a hoot?
- No. Why would I know that?

30
00:02:29,293 --> 00:02:33,332
Let's take Fry to do everything
he ever wanted to do.

31
00:02:33,533 --> 00:02:35,364
- Everything?
- Except that.

32
00:02:38,333 --> 00:02:42,167
So your fantasy has always been
to destroys a planet?

33
00:02:42,413 --> 00:02:45,849
Yeah. What did they ever do for me?

34
00:02:49,933 --> 00:02:54,245
The most humdrum activities seem
almost exciting through your eyes.

35
00:02:54,493 --> 00:02:57,291
- What next?
- I wanna see the edge of the universe.

36
00:02:57,453 --> 00:03:00,650
- Sounds cool.
- Funny, you live in the universe...

37
00:03:00,813 --> 00:03:04,089
...but you never do these things
till someone visits.

38
00:03:06,973 --> 00:03:09,965
There it is! The edge of the universe.

39
00:03:23,493 --> 00:03:27,532
Far out. So there's an infinite
number of parallel universes?

40
00:03:27,773 --> 00:03:31,561
- No, just the two.
- Well, I'm sure that's enough.

41
00:03:31,773 --> 00:03:34,810
I'm sick of parallel Bender lording
his cowboy hat over me.

42
00:03:34,973 --> 00:03:37,282
Let's move on to Fry's next fantasy.

43
00:03:41,653 --> 00:03:44,292
Bow before your master, puny mortals.

44
00:03:49,253 --> 00:03:52,882
- Mommy, why is that man like that?
- Don't look at him.

45
00:03:53,813 --> 00:03:56,771
That was fun. Let's give him a treat.

46
00:04:06,253 --> 00:04:09,006
Keep your palms flat.

47
00:04:11,613 --> 00:04:14,173
The tongue tickles.

48
00:04:18,733 --> 00:04:21,611
These new hands are great.
I'll break them in tonight.

49
00:04:21,813 --> 00:04:23,769
It's been quite an hour and a half.

50
00:04:23,973 --> 00:04:26,806
Two fantasies left: to be invisible
in a chocolate factory...

51
00:04:26,973 --> 00:04:29,771
...and to be romantically linked
with a celebrity.

52
00:04:30,013 --> 00:04:33,323
I could pound your head till you think
that's what happened.

53
00:04:33,493 --> 00:04:37,486
Wait, hold on.
It is possible to meet any celebrity.

54
00:04:37,693 --> 00:04:40,571
- It is?
- Of course. You should read a blimp.

55
00:04:41,693 --> 00:04:45,811
"Download a celebrity."
What part of that do I understand?

56
00:04:46,053 --> 00:04:50,808
It's simple. You can download
a celebrity into a blank robot.

57
00:04:51,053 --> 00:04:53,283
I have an idea. Let's do that.

58
00:04:56,613 --> 00:04:59,127
Onto the Internet you go.

59
00:04:59,293 --> 00:05:03,411
While you're there, pick me up
a few credit card numbers.

60
00:05:12,293 --> 00:05:14,727
Kirk could kick Picard's ass.

61
00:05:14,973 --> 00:05:17,885
At least Picard had the guts
to admit he was bald.

62
00:05:18,053 --> 00:05:19,566
You take that back.

63
00:05:19,733 --> 00:05:20,882
eBay.

64
00:05:22,693 --> 00:05:26,242
Are there no further bids
for this exquisite galaxy?

65
00:05:26,413 --> 00:05:29,405
Sold to the being of
inconceivable horror.

66
00:05:30,013 --> 00:05:32,607
- Will a money order be okay?
- Yes.

67
00:05:35,613 --> 00:05:40,209
- Where's the celebrity dating place?
- Let's search the Web.

68
00:05:40,653 --> 00:05:41,642
Over there.

69
00:05:48,773 --> 00:05:53,324
Welcome to Nappster.
Let's see who we've got in stock.

70
00:05:54,213 --> 00:05:58,525
- Gwyneth Paltrow?
- Nah. I read she drinks human blood.

71
00:05:58,693 --> 00:06:02,527
How about Cleopatra, whose
beauty destroyed mighty empires?

72
00:06:02,733 --> 00:06:05,452
I'd prefer someone
with shaved underarms.

73
00:06:05,653 --> 00:06:08,042
Do you have anything with a
Lucy Liu feel to it?

74
00:06:08,253 --> 00:06:11,450
Nothing like that.
Although we do have Lucy Liu.

75
00:06:11,653 --> 00:06:15,851
<i>Only woman to be named People's
Sexiest Woman of the Year twice:</i>

76
00:06:16,013 --> 00:06:18,163
In 2003 and then again in 2063.

77
00:06:18,373 --> 00:06:21,570
I'd like the 2003 model.

78
00:06:24,293 --> 00:06:26,761
I found her! What do I do now?

79
00:06:27,013 --> 00:06:31,928
Download her. Let's just put
a blank robot in the drive.

80
00:06:42,613 --> 00:06:44,843
It worked.

81
00:06:45,013 --> 00:06:49,882
You're one sexy man, Philip J. Fry.

82
00:06:51,573 --> 00:06:53,086
It worked perfectly.

83
00:07:00,173 --> 00:07:02,528
Well, you downloaded Lucy Liu.

84
00:07:02,733 --> 00:07:05,486
Are you just gonna stare
vacantly at her?

85
00:07:07,693 --> 00:07:11,971
I find your slack-jawed stare
very attractive, Philip J. Fry.

86
00:07:12,213 --> 00:07:13,805
Hear that? She likes me.

87
00:07:14,013 --> 00:07:16,732
Well, duh!
She's programmed to like you.

88
00:07:16,933 --> 00:07:21,006
But this is Lucy Liu, the only
good actress of the 21 st century.

89
00:07:21,173 --> 00:07:22,765
She's more than software.

90
00:07:22,973 --> 00:07:25,533
Would you like to register me?

91
00:07:25,693 --> 00:07:29,971
- Not right now.
- I'll remind you later, you hot stud.

92
00:07:30,213 --> 00:07:32,568
So, what do you feel like doing?

93
00:07:32,813 --> 00:07:36,123
- Would you like to register me?
- I said later.

94
00:07:38,933 --> 00:07:41,447
When I feel so stuffed I can't eat...

95
00:07:41,653 --> 00:07:44,326
...I use the restroom,
and then I can eat more.

96
00:07:44,573 --> 00:07:49,203
You should write a book. People need
to know about the "can eat more."

97
00:07:49,413 --> 00:07:53,372
You're just like I thought
you'd be from your movies.

98
00:07:53,573 --> 00:07:56,929
My personality is mathematically
derived from my movies...

99
00:07:57,093 --> 00:08:00,165
...proportionately weighted
by box office receipts.

100
00:08:29,173 --> 00:08:31,129
- You're cute.
- You're cute.

101
00:08:31,333 --> 00:08:34,370
- You.
- You.

102
00:08:34,573 --> 00:08:38,646
Oh, dear. She's stuck in
an infinite loop and he's an idiot.

103
00:08:38,813 --> 00:08:40,531
That's love for you.

104
00:08:40,773 --> 00:08:45,324
Humans dating robots is sick.
You people wonder why I'm still single?

105
00:08:45,573 --> 00:08:49,122
It's 'cause all the fine robot sisters
are dating humans!

106
00:08:49,373 --> 00:08:51,204
This is Fry's decision.

107
00:08:51,373 --> 00:08:54,729
And he made it wrong,
so it's time for us to interfere.

108
00:08:56,893 --> 00:09:00,329
She doesn't love you. She can't.
She's a machine...

109
00:09:00,493 --> 00:09:04,281
Stay away from our women!
You've got metal fever, boy!

110
00:09:04,493 --> 00:09:07,769
So what if I love a robot?
It's not hurting anybody.

111
00:09:07,973 --> 00:09:12,603
He never took middle school hygiene.
He never saw the propaganda film.

112
00:09:12,773 --> 00:09:17,051
It's just lucky I keep a copy
in the VCR at all times.

113
00:09:20,533 --> 00:09:22,330
Ordinary human dating.

114
00:09:22,573 --> 00:09:27,363
It's enjoyable, and it serves
an important purpose.

115
00:09:29,053 --> 00:09:33,331
But when a human dates an artificial
mate, there is no purpose...

116
00:09:33,493 --> 00:09:37,406
...only enjoyment.
And that leads to tragedy.

117
00:09:43,093 --> 00:09:45,482
Neat-o! A Marilyn Monroe-Bot.

118
00:09:45,653 --> 00:09:50,124
You're a dreamboat, Billy Everyteen.

119
00:09:50,333 --> 00:09:53,848
Harmless fun?
Let's see what happens next.

120
00:09:57,133 --> 00:09:59,249
Do you want to walk your dog?

121
00:09:59,453 --> 00:10:02,684
I'd rather make out
with my Monroe-Bot.

122
00:10:04,013 --> 00:10:07,244
Do you want to get a paper route
and earn some cash?

123
00:10:07,453 --> 00:10:11,924
No, thanks. I'd rather make out
with my Monroe-Bot.

124
00:10:12,413 --> 00:10:15,883
Do you want to come over?
We can make out together.

125
00:10:16,093 --> 00:10:18,323
Your house is across the street.

126
00:10:18,533 --> 00:10:22,048
That's an awfully long way
to go for making out.

127
00:10:22,213 --> 00:10:24,363
What went wrong in that scene?

128
00:10:24,533 --> 00:10:28,048
Ordinarily, Billy would work hard
to make money with his paper route...

129
00:10:28,213 --> 00:10:31,171
...then use the money
to buy dinner for Mavis...

130
00:10:31,333 --> 00:10:34,803
...thus earning a slim chance
to perform the reproductive act.

131
00:10:35,013 --> 00:10:38,972
But if teens can date robots,
why should he bother?

132
00:10:39,213 --> 00:10:43,604
Why should anyone bother? Let's look
at Billy's planet a year later.

133
00:10:43,813 --> 00:10:48,728
Where are all the football stars?
And where are the biochemists?

134
00:10:48,933 --> 00:10:53,563
They're trapped. Trapped in
the soft, viselike grip of robot lips.

135
00:10:55,533 --> 00:10:59,492
All civilization was an effort
to impress the opposite sex.

136
00:11:01,613 --> 00:11:03,604
And sometimes the same sex.

137
00:11:03,813 --> 00:11:08,762
Now, let's skip forward 80 years
into the future. Where's Billy?

138
00:11:12,333 --> 00:11:14,483
Farewell.

139
00:11:15,013 --> 00:11:18,972
The next day, Billy's planet
was destroyed by aliens.

140
00:11:23,133 --> 00:11:27,172
Have you guessed the name
of Billy's planet? It was Earth!

141
00:11:27,413 --> 00:11:29,847
Don't date robots!

142
00:11:30,093 --> 00:11:32,482
<i>Brought to you by
The Space Pope.</i>

143
00:11:32,693 --> 00:11:36,402
Did that make any impression
on you? Fry?

144
00:11:40,933 --> 00:11:45,529
<i>I knew I should have shown him
Electro Gonorrhea: The Noisy Killer.</i>

145
00:11:47,133 --> 00:11:49,283
What is the world coming to?

146
00:11:49,493 --> 00:11:54,567
That Fry's a sicko pervert, I tell you.
Dating a robot, it's an atrosamacy!

147
00:11:54,813 --> 00:11:59,967
- But Fry's our friend, Bender.
- Will you stifle there, meat bag?

148
00:12:00,173 --> 00:12:04,371
- You stifle, Bender.
- Finally you're standing up to him.

149
00:12:04,613 --> 00:12:06,524
Although he is completely right.

150
00:12:06,733 --> 00:12:10,123
We've got to stem this
tidal wave of moral decay.

151
00:12:10,373 --> 00:12:13,843
It's time to shut down
Nappster. com.

152
00:12:16,293 --> 00:12:17,772
Who's in charge?

153
00:12:17,973 --> 00:12:21,522
If you're an investor, you can
dump your money in the hole.

154
00:12:21,733 --> 00:12:24,167
- Listen, you Internet nerd.
- Listening.

155
00:12:24,373 --> 00:12:26,568
Your company promotes wrong love.

156
00:12:26,813 --> 00:12:31,568
If you don't shut down, the only thing
wired about you will be your jaw.

157
00:12:31,733 --> 00:12:36,727
The Internet is about the free exchange
and sale of other people's ideas.

158
00:12:36,973 --> 00:12:40,602
- We've done nothing wrong.
- Help! I'm being held prisoner.

159
00:12:40,773 --> 00:12:42,604
Someone in trouble is.

160
00:12:42,813 --> 00:12:48,524
No. Stay out. There's a guy going
for the Tetris world record in there.

161
00:12:53,653 --> 00:12:55,211
- Who are you?
- Don't hurt us.

162
00:12:55,373 --> 00:12:58,809
Help me! They've been holding
me prisoner for 800 years.

163
00:12:59,013 --> 00:13:02,847
The real Lucy Liu!
The one you can see a movie of.

164
00:13:03,013 --> 00:13:04,492
What's your problem?

165
00:13:04,693 --> 00:13:09,130
Those sweaty nerds are making
illegal copies of us.

166
00:13:11,093 --> 00:13:12,526
It hurts!

167
00:13:13,333 --> 00:13:16,723
Open this door. Don't make me
call the maintenance guy.

168
00:13:16,933 --> 00:13:20,289
- It's a bluff.
- We can't take that chance. Move!

169
00:13:20,493 --> 00:13:24,691
- Please pick me up before you go-go.
- She asked first.

170
00:13:35,173 --> 00:13:37,368
Are you Lucy Liu?

171
00:13:39,413 --> 00:13:40,402
Sure.

172
00:13:47,093 --> 00:13:51,644
We're doomed! They got the head.
They uncovered the sign.

173
00:13:51,853 --> 00:13:54,321
The world will learn
we're cyber-criminals.

174
00:13:54,533 --> 00:13:58,572
We'd have gotten away with it if
it weren't for those meddling adults.

175
00:13:58,733 --> 00:14:01,201
We'll stop them. They like Lucy Liu?

176
00:14:01,373 --> 00:14:06,527
We'll give them all the Lucy Liu they
can handle. Hand me that backup disk.

177
00:14:19,173 --> 00:14:23,405
Did you see me escaping?
I was all like:

178
00:14:23,613 --> 00:14:27,242
Thanks for rescuing me.
Especially you, Bender.

179
00:14:27,413 --> 00:14:30,371
Quite a masculine piece of metal,
aren't you?

180
00:14:30,613 --> 00:14:32,365
Don't look at me like that.

181
00:14:32,533 --> 00:14:36,367
If you're thinking of crossing
the line, you can forget it.

182
00:14:36,533 --> 00:14:38,330
Bender don't bend that way.

183
00:14:38,573 --> 00:14:41,212
Hey, look. It's another Lucy Liu-Bot.

184
00:14:41,413 --> 00:14:45,201
I am Lucy Liu. Give me your spines.

185
00:14:47,333 --> 00:14:49,164
Hey, what the...?

186
00:14:49,693 --> 00:14:52,685
Take this, and that, and one of these.

187
00:14:54,173 --> 00:14:57,609
Cut it out.
I don't need this kind of publicity.

188
00:15:03,933 --> 00:15:08,723
All right, Liu. Time to kick
your frosty, well-toned ass.

189
00:15:18,813 --> 00:15:21,088
Then along came Bender.

190
00:15:22,253 --> 00:15:25,006
Looks like you're retaining water.

191
00:15:28,733 --> 00:15:33,568
That was incredible, Bender. You're
like Jackie Chan before he got doughy.

192
00:15:33,773 --> 00:15:36,731
Shucks, I wasn't afraid of that robot.

193
00:15:36,933 --> 00:15:41,290
I'm pretty brave once you get past
my macho exterior...

194
00:15:45,493 --> 00:15:50,567
- It's an army of Lucy Lius!
- They're horrible.

195
00:15:51,293 --> 00:15:54,330
Take this, and that, and one of these.

196
00:15:55,693 --> 00:15:58,446
- Robot Crouching Tiger.
- Robot Crane Style.

197
00:16:04,053 --> 00:16:07,728
Now that's a wave of destruction
that's easy on the eyes.

198
00:16:13,413 --> 00:16:17,452
This is the best movie I've ever seen.
It has a vampire and an explosion.

199
00:16:17,613 --> 00:16:20,730
It's amazing the way
you notice two things.

200
00:16:20,933 --> 00:16:24,482
<i>No! Don 't open that coffin.
It's ticking.</i>

201
00:16:24,653 --> 00:16:29,124
<i>I have to, Alex. That coffin 's
not going to open itself.</i>

202
00:16:33,253 --> 00:16:36,689
Let's hide in here.
It'll add to my box office gross.

203
00:16:37,333 --> 00:16:40,723
- Fry?
- You guys came to watch me make out.

204
00:16:40,973 --> 00:16:43,009
That is so sweet.

205
00:16:43,173 --> 00:16:46,324
Wait, is that the head
of who I think it's of?

206
00:16:46,533 --> 00:16:49,366
Read the jar, Evelyn Wood. Doctor Z?

207
00:16:50,973 --> 00:16:55,251
A herd of Lucy Liu are destroying
the city. Is yours acting normally?

208
00:16:55,413 --> 00:16:57,529
Let me see.

209
00:16:58,773 --> 00:17:00,172
Yep. Why do you ask?

210
00:17:00,373 --> 00:17:03,968
<i>If you want to see the real vampire,
look in the mirror.</i>

211
00:17:04,133 --> 00:17:07,091
<i>I can 't. I'm a vampire.</i>

212
00:17:18,773 --> 00:17:19,922
Why?

213
00:17:20,733 --> 00:17:23,327
And Nappster says illegal copies
never hurt anybody.

214
00:17:23,533 --> 00:17:25,808
Quick, this way.

215
00:17:29,733 --> 00:17:32,042
Sorry, ladies. Employees only.

216
00:17:41,853 --> 00:17:46,210
They're forming a human
pyramid... Of robots.

217
00:17:48,053 --> 00:17:51,932
We weren't counting on them
being as smart as they are sexy.

218
00:17:52,133 --> 00:17:54,124
A dangerous mistake to make.

219
00:17:55,333 --> 00:17:58,848
- At least we've got food.
- Dr. Zoidberg, cut open that bag.

220
00:17:59,053 --> 00:18:00,850
- Hooray!
- And don't eat it.

221
00:18:06,453 --> 00:18:10,048
- Data error.
- Do not compute.

222
00:18:15,653 --> 00:18:18,008
Life was bad,
but now it's good forever!

223
00:18:36,613 --> 00:18:41,767
You'll be safe in here, sweetheart.
Get lost, Pavarotti.

224
00:18:43,773 --> 00:18:45,729
If I don't survive the corn...

225
00:18:45,973 --> 00:18:51,047
...I love you as much as a man can
love a computerized image...

226
00:18:51,293 --> 00:18:52,726
...which is a lot.

227
00:18:52,933 --> 00:18:56,642
Oh, Fry. I love you more
than the moon and the stars...

228
00:18:56,813 --> 00:18:59,885
...and the... Poetic image
number 37 not found.

229
00:19:04,253 --> 00:19:06,209
What are you doing? Get down.

230
00:19:08,733 --> 00:19:12,806
Light hot. Oil temperature rising.

231
00:19:13,133 --> 00:19:15,169
- Oh, no.
- Malfunction.

232
00:19:15,413 --> 00:19:19,292
- This ain't good.
- System error.

233
00:19:22,013 --> 00:19:24,447
You saved us. Are you all right?

234
00:19:24,613 --> 00:19:30,165
Yes, my love. I'll be just...
Massive corn clog in port seven.

235
00:19:30,373 --> 00:19:32,728
- Are you the last copy of me?
- Yes.

236
00:19:32,933 --> 00:19:35,322
- Erase her, Fry.
- What? No!

237
00:19:35,533 --> 00:19:39,572
When you downloaded her without
my permission, you stole my image...

238
00:19:39,733 --> 00:19:44,409
...and that's all I have. That and
the largest gold nugget in the world.

239
00:19:44,613 --> 00:19:46,843
I downloaded her
because I love you.

240
00:19:47,053 --> 00:19:50,762
If you love the real me,
not just what you've seen in movies...

241
00:19:50,933 --> 00:19:55,324
<i>...genre-straddling lawyer shows
and articles in People magazine...</i>

242
00:19:55,493 --> 00:19:58,644
...you'll blank out that robot.

243
00:20:06,413 --> 00:20:08,768
I'm sorry.

244
00:20:09,173 --> 00:20:11,812
Hug me, Liu-Bot.

245
00:20:23,053 --> 00:20:27,922
I'll always remember you, Fry.
Memory deleted.

246
00:20:29,893 --> 00:20:31,645
I know it hurts, buddy.

247
00:20:31,893 --> 00:20:36,648
But at least you're not
in a sick relationship anymore.

248
00:20:36,813 --> 00:20:40,567
And I guess now I can get
to know the real Lucy Liu.

249
00:20:40,813 --> 00:20:45,364
- Yeah, at our wedding.
- It's true. Bender and I are in love.

250
00:20:45,573 --> 00:20:46,608
But... But...

251
00:20:46,813 --> 00:20:49,486
Don't be a prude, Fry.
