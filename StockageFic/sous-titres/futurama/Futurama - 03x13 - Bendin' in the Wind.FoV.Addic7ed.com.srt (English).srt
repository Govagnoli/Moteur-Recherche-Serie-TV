1
00:00:07,453 --> 00:00:09,409
Bendin' in the Wind

2
00:00:48,013 --> 00:00:53,167
Oh, my God! They dug up a bag
of olestra chips from my time!

3
00:00:59,133 --> 00:01:03,172
There must be layers and layers
of old stuff down there.

4
00:01:04,733 --> 00:01:10,842
- Is that one of those Led Zeppelins?
- No, it's an old Volkswagen van!

5
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:14,882
Mind if I take this old van?

6
00:01:15,053 --> 00:01:18,728
Sure. You wanna dump
the corpses out of there, it's yours.

7
00:01:18,933 --> 00:01:21,447
Yeah, I've gotten used cars before.

8
00:01:30,173 --> 00:01:33,722
What's that?
One of those Jefferson Starships?

9
00:01:33,933 --> 00:01:35,161
It's called a van.

10
00:01:35,333 --> 00:01:40,202
And in light of the fact it's not
rocking, I invite you to come knocking.

11
00:01:40,373 --> 00:01:43,285
It's a triumph of German engineering!

12
00:01:43,493 --> 00:01:48,806
The speedometer only goes up to 80.
It can't go faster than 80,000 mph?

13
00:01:49,013 --> 00:01:53,768
No, but it's got a driver's-side floor
and an eight-track player!

14
00:01:53,973 --> 00:01:58,444
Where's the device that lets you
speed or slow the passage of time?

15
00:01:58,653 --> 00:01:59,802
Under the seat.

16
00:02:03,013 --> 00:02:05,322
- Why won't it start?
- It needs gas.

17
00:02:05,493 --> 00:02:11,568
Wrong again, idiot. There is no gas.
Petroleum reserves ran dry in 2038.

18
00:02:11,773 --> 00:02:15,971
Gas was an environmental disaster.
We use alternative fuels.

19
00:02:16,173 --> 00:02:17,606
- Like what?
- Whale oil.

20
00:02:19,493 --> 00:02:23,008
- Bender, lift it up to the can opener.
- Oh, no!

21
00:02:23,173 --> 00:02:26,722
Last time, that magnetic psycho
nearly cut my head off!

22
00:02:26,893 --> 00:02:31,409
Plus the magnet impairs your inhibition
unit and makes you sing folk songs.

23
00:02:31,573 --> 00:02:36,886
What? Who said anything about me
secretly wanting to be a folk singer?

24
00:02:37,053 --> 00:02:43,572
If you don't open that can now, your
fear will own you, and nothing's worse!

25
00:02:43,773 --> 00:02:46,367
Okay! Okay, I can do this.

26
00:02:46,573 --> 00:02:50,771
It's time to take life by the cans.

27
00:02:55,333 --> 00:02:58,291
- Come on, you can do it!
- Go on, you dummy!

28
00:03:08,813 --> 00:03:10,769
Oh, no!

29
00:03:13,733 --> 00:03:16,327
It's toe-tappingly tragic!

30
00:03:19,093 --> 00:03:23,291
Doc, I can't move my arms and legs!
What's wrong with me?

31
00:03:23,533 --> 00:03:26,764
- This is the worst part of the job.
- Good news?

32
00:03:26,973 --> 00:03:32,172
Bender, your hydraulics are shot.
You'll never move again.

33
00:03:32,373 --> 00:03:36,571
- You mean...?
- Sorry, you'll have to get a new one.

34
00:03:39,893 --> 00:03:42,965
- Poor Bender!
- Well, let's drag him to the curb.

35
00:03:43,173 --> 00:03:45,528
Wait! Bender is my best friend.

36
00:03:45,733 --> 00:03:49,612
We can't just dump him in the gutter
like Grandma's ashes.

37
00:03:49,853 --> 00:03:55,007
My life is over.
I'll never know happiness again!

38
00:03:55,933 --> 00:03:58,970
- Hello, there.
- Look! It's Patch Cord Adams!

39
00:03:59,213 --> 00:04:03,047
- He heals with the power of laughter.
- Come on, take it.

40
00:04:03,293 --> 00:04:07,809
- Can't move your arms?
- No, or I'd be strangling you right now!

41
00:04:08,013 --> 00:04:10,083
Here's a giggle!

42
00:04:11,893 --> 00:04:14,930
Why do they use Windows 3000
as a prison guard?

43
00:04:15,093 --> 00:04:17,766
Because it always locks up.

44
00:04:18,973 --> 00:04:24,969
- For God's sake, somebody kick his ass!
- Well, so long. Get well soon.

45
00:04:25,333 --> 00:04:27,972
Well, so long anyway.

46
00:04:30,053 --> 00:04:33,363
I'm doomed.
Everybody leave me alone!

47
00:04:33,573 --> 00:04:36,565
I don't want to be seen this way.

48
00:04:37,493 --> 00:04:42,567
You look so sad. Do you want me
to send Patch Cord Adams back in?

49
00:04:50,893 --> 00:04:55,171
Hey, the blues! The tragic sound
of other people suffering.

50
00:04:55,413 --> 00:04:57,881
That's kind of a pick-me-up.

51
00:05:05,173 --> 00:05:08,483
- That was great!
- Thanks. Are you a fan?

52
00:05:08,693 --> 00:05:11,048
I don't know. Let me see.

53
00:05:11,773 --> 00:05:14,082
Oh, my God, you're Beck!

54
00:05:14,293 --> 00:05:19,731
I'd get up to shake hands and steal
your wallet, but my body crapped out.

55
00:05:19,933 --> 00:05:21,844
I used to miss my body too...

56
00:05:22,013 --> 00:05:26,165
...but then I fished this mannequin
out of the 92¢ Store dumpster.

57
00:05:26,373 --> 00:05:31,003
We've got a lot in common. I always
dreamed of being a musician-poet...

58
00:05:31,173 --> 00:05:34,449
...who transcends genres even
as he reinvents them.

59
00:05:34,653 --> 00:05:38,965
- So do it. It's easier than it looks.
- Thanks, but it's hopeless.

60
00:05:39,173 --> 00:05:42,370
- I'll never be a musician now.
- Or maybe...

61
00:05:42,573 --> 00:05:46,168
...you'll be the best musician ever.

62
00:05:53,093 --> 00:05:54,128
What's this for?

63
00:05:54,293 --> 00:05:58,445
Try and scrape it across your chest
like a knife on burnt toast.

64
00:05:59,853 --> 00:06:05,371
Move those arms! Use the power of
mental thinking. Make it dynamic!

65
00:06:06,133 --> 00:06:09,330
Yeah! Congratulations, my friend.

66
00:06:09,493 --> 00:06:14,851
- Why, 'cause I made an annoying noise?
- I use those all the time in my music.

67
00:06:15,013 --> 00:06:18,210
Bender, I want you to be
my new washboard player.

68
00:06:19,133 --> 00:06:23,968
All right! Go Bender!
Go Bender! Go Bender!

69
00:06:31,733 --> 00:06:36,682
That's my good friend Beck. I'm off
to rock a series of midlevel venues.

70
00:06:36,933 --> 00:06:40,084
Kudos, Bender! You got mangled,
and now you're a singer.

71
00:06:40,293 --> 00:06:43,205
Both our dreams came true.

72
00:06:43,413 --> 00:06:50,012
Who wants to cram in my van, follow
Bender on tour and live in the van?

73
00:06:50,973 --> 00:06:56,570
I don't know, Fry. I think I'm too
poor to follow a band around in a van.

74
00:06:57,133 --> 00:07:01,604
Move it! We gotta get to the concert
and make the audience wait!

75
00:07:26,973 --> 00:07:31,967
- Bad news, friends. My shell ran.
- Zoidberg, you idiot!

76
00:07:32,173 --> 00:07:35,563
- My outfit! It's...
- Kind of cool!

77
00:07:35,773 --> 00:07:38,526
- I like it!
- Me too, now that I'm used to it.

78
00:07:38,733 --> 00:07:43,363
Then it was all on purpose!
You're lucky to have me as a friend.

79
00:07:43,533 --> 00:07:46,366
But cross me,
and I'll turn on you like that!

80
00:08:09,213 --> 00:08:12,967
<i>Got a washboard stomach
And a microphone</i>

81
00:08:14,293 --> 00:08:16,409
<i>That was a washboard break</i>

82
00:08:20,413 --> 00:08:22,244
One bowl of Jell-O knuckles.

83
00:08:22,413 --> 00:08:26,372
That'll be three pictures
of George Washington.

84
00:08:26,573 --> 00:08:30,612
- Oh, no! My beautiful money!
- It got ruined in the wash!

85
00:08:30,853 --> 00:08:35,290
- Mine too, even my change.
- Get lost, you moneyless hippies!

86
00:08:35,493 --> 00:08:39,645
You heard him, freaks!
We don't like your type around here!

87
00:08:39,853 --> 00:08:42,321
These are the types we like.

88
00:08:44,973 --> 00:08:48,727
That was the best 40-minute
washboard solo I've ever heard.

89
00:08:48,933 --> 00:08:52,972
The parts when I was awake
blew my mind!

90
00:08:54,173 --> 00:08:57,609
Check out all those broken robots.
Howdy, fellas!

91
00:08:57,813 --> 00:09:02,045
I don't believe my broken eyes!
It's Bender, the washboard player!

92
00:09:02,253 --> 00:09:06,166
- We caught your concert from here.
- You rock!

93
00:09:06,373 --> 00:09:10,844
Bender, sign my chest!
It's in that bin behind me!

94
00:09:11,053 --> 00:09:14,762
Thanks for showing
that broken robots are still useful.

95
00:09:14,973 --> 00:09:19,922
Hang in there, folks. I bet
before you know it, you guys will be...

96
00:09:28,333 --> 00:09:32,292
That's so wrong! They can't
just melt down broken robots!

97
00:09:32,533 --> 00:09:36,765
- Not right when they're kissing my ass.
- Just cold chill.

98
00:09:38,333 --> 00:09:42,167
When I'm upset, I write a song.
I wrote "Devil's Haircut"...

99
00:09:42,373 --> 00:09:45,570
...when I was feeling...
What's that song about?

100
00:09:45,773 --> 00:09:51,962
Yeah, I could write a song! With real
words, not phony ones like "odelay."

101
00:09:52,133 --> 00:09:55,443
Odelay is a word.
Look it up in the Becktionary.

102
00:10:04,453 --> 00:10:07,490
I'm working on my song.
Hand me the Becktionary.

103
00:10:07,653 --> 00:10:10,770
No, the rhyming Becktionary.

104
00:10:10,973 --> 00:10:14,170
I'd like to raise awareness
about broken robots...

105
00:10:14,373 --> 00:10:17,251
...but what can I do?
I only weigh 8 pounds.

106
00:10:17,413 --> 00:10:22,407
Wait! You know lots of rock stars,
and they like to look like they care.

107
00:10:22,653 --> 00:10:26,282
We can all do a big benefit concert
in San Francisco!

108
00:10:26,493 --> 00:10:31,692
- We can call it "Bend-Aid," after me!
- And you can sing your song!

109
00:10:31,893 --> 00:10:37,445
And I'll let you sing backup! But
remember who the star is. Me, Bender.

110
00:11:09,573 --> 00:11:13,930
All right. "Hands in the air" rhymes
with "just don't care"...

111
00:11:14,133 --> 00:11:16,567
...and finished!

112
00:11:18,333 --> 00:11:22,565
- Smells like something died in here.
- Surprise!

113
00:11:23,773 --> 00:11:27,083
Can we crash here?
The colors in the van keep us awake.

114
00:11:27,293 --> 00:11:30,251
All right, but hands off the minibar.

115
00:11:31,733 --> 00:11:37,012
I forgot about TV. Living on the road,
you realize life is better without it.

116
00:11:37,253 --> 00:11:39,687
Well, let's see what's on.

117
00:11:39,893 --> 00:11:44,808
<i>Tuesday, Golden Gate Park! Monsters
of vaguely folkish alterna-rock...</i>

118
00:11:45,053 --> 00:11:49,365
<i>... will strum your brains out
at Bend-Aid!</i>

119
00:11:49,573 --> 00:11:54,169
<i>Featuring: Beck, Wailing Fungus,
and special guest, Bender!</i>

120
00:11:54,373 --> 00:11:58,002
<i>A portion of the proceeds might go
to help broken robots.</i>

121
00:11:58,173 --> 00:11:59,970
Bender, you're famous!

122
00:12:01,653 --> 00:12:07,762
This coming together of superstars
really means a lot to you, doesn't it?

123
00:12:08,013 --> 00:12:13,929
Helping my defective brothers is
the first thing I've ever cared about.

124
00:12:14,573 --> 00:12:19,010
You know, when I first got broken,
I thought my life was over.

125
00:12:19,253 --> 00:12:24,373
But look at me now.
I've got fame, money, groupies...

126
00:12:24,573 --> 00:12:28,009
...and it's all thanks
to being completely immobilized.

127
00:12:28,253 --> 00:12:32,804
That's why I'll be proud to go up
on stage and say, "Look at me...

128
00:12:33,053 --> 00:12:35,169
...I am a broken robot!"

129
00:12:35,413 --> 00:12:41,568
- Bender! You can move! You're cured!
- Oh, crap! It's a miracle.

130
00:12:45,933 --> 00:12:48,766
I can move again.

131
00:12:49,093 --> 00:12:51,891
My music career is over.

132
00:12:52,093 --> 00:12:56,803
I don't understand the biz,
but wouldn't being able to move help?

133
00:12:57,053 --> 00:13:02,252
No! Don't you see? I was a hero
to broken robots. I was one of them.

134
00:13:02,493 --> 00:13:05,690
How can I sing about being damaged
if I'm not?

135
00:13:05,933 --> 00:13:10,370
That's like Christina Aguilera
singing in Spanish.

136
00:13:10,613 --> 00:13:13,207
Wait! That's it! I'll fake it!

137
00:13:25,973 --> 00:13:28,851
- Don't do that at the concert.
- I can't stop.

138
00:13:29,053 --> 00:13:32,762
When I eat too much dirt,
I get stuff in my throat.

139
00:13:33,493 --> 00:13:36,690
You are so disgusting! l...

140
00:13:39,053 --> 00:13:42,284
- They're beautiful!
- You're touching them!

141
00:13:42,533 --> 00:13:46,412
I've never seen pearls like this.
You're amazing!

142
00:13:46,653 --> 00:13:50,771
I am? At last! Recognition!

143
00:13:56,573 --> 00:13:59,804
<i>Put your hands together
for the folk stylings...</i>

144
00:14:00,013 --> 00:14:02,971
<i>... of Cylon and Garfunkel!</i>

145
00:14:05,653 --> 00:14:10,568
Here's a song that was beautiful
when performed by my ancestor Art.

146
00:14:34,853 --> 00:14:38,050
- We're home.
- Let's earn some bread.

147
00:14:40,173 --> 00:14:45,167
Get your love beads! Can't journey
to your mind's center without them!

148
00:14:45,373 --> 00:14:50,049
Look at the colors!
These will go great with my soul.

149
00:14:50,213 --> 00:14:54,252
Glad you like them. I've been making
fine jewelry for years, apparently.

150
00:14:54,413 --> 00:14:57,166
- I'll take three!
- Give me one, man!

151
00:14:57,333 --> 00:14:59,051
I'll trade you a bad poem!

152
00:14:59,213 --> 00:15:05,163
<i>And now, stand up and turn on your
hidden tape recorders for... Beck!</i>

153
00:15:05,373 --> 00:15:09,002
<i>With special guest,
Bender, the broken robot!</i>

154
00:15:15,093 --> 00:15:17,561
- Bender rules!
- Groove on, man!

155
00:15:17,773 --> 00:15:19,968
Rock it, Bender!

156
00:15:42,333 --> 00:15:45,450
That song doesn't usually
last three hours...

157
00:15:45,693 --> 00:15:49,891
...but we got into a serious thing,
and then I forgot how it ended.

158
00:15:50,093 --> 00:15:52,812
Anyway, one last item
of business before we go.

159
00:15:53,173 --> 00:15:56,165
Bender, to start your foundation
for broken robots...

160
00:15:56,373 --> 00:15:59,843
...here's a big cardboard check
for $ 1 4,000.

161
00:16:00,053 --> 00:16:04,808
- It's been an emotional day for me.
- I don't know what to say.

162
00:16:05,013 --> 00:16:09,404
Then maybe you should sing it.
Lay it down, boys.

163
00:16:09,613 --> 00:16:13,162
Ladies, gentlemen,
smoking heaps of machinery...

164
00:16:15,133 --> 00:16:19,365
...this is a song called
"My Broken Friend."

165
00:16:21,173 --> 00:16:26,566
<i>People say my broken friend is useless
But I say his mind is free</i>

166
00:16:26,773 --> 00:16:32,006
<i>There's lots of things
My mangled robot friend could be</i>

167
00:16:32,213 --> 00:16:33,202
Kick it.

168
00:16:33,413 --> 00:16:37,088
<i>- He could make a good hatrack
- He only has to stand there</i>

169
00:16:37,293 --> 00:16:40,285
<i>- Or a cheap doorstop
- He doesn 't need to move</i>

170
00:16:40,493 --> 00:16:44,372
<i>Or a great big, giant thermos
With a twist-off top</i>

171
00:16:44,573 --> 00:16:48,612
<i>- That would be good for soup
- He could be a storage closet</i>

172
00:16:48,853 --> 00:16:51,970
<i>- For outdated pants
- I like them tight</i>

173
00:16:52,173 --> 00:16:54,767
<i>My broken friend could do it all</i>

174
00:16:54,973 --> 00:16:57,533
<i>Just give him a chance</i>

175
00:16:57,733 --> 00:17:03,603
<i>That robot has a tragic secret
That I'd like to share</i>

176
00:17:03,813 --> 00:17:09,092
<i>My broken friend is closer to me
Than an ass to a chair</i>

177
00:17:09,933 --> 00:17:13,005
<i>- That robot's name I never told you
- Who's that?</i>

178
00:17:13,253 --> 00:17:15,813
<i>- You could not foresee
- Give it up.</i>

179
00:17:16,053 --> 00:17:21,650
<i>I'll say it loud and sing it proud
His name is you and me</i>

180
00:17:21,853 --> 00:17:25,004
<i>- Don 't melt me into a crowbar
- It suffers alone</i>

181
00:17:25,213 --> 00:17:27,647
<i>Just 'cause I can 't move
my arms and legs</i>

182
00:17:27,853 --> 00:17:30,572
<i>- Or toss me into a trashcan
- What are you doing?</i>

183
00:17:30,733 --> 00:17:33,645
<i>- Because I can 't cook eggs
- What are you doing?!</i>

184
00:17:33,853 --> 00:17:36,526
<i>- Don 't crush me into an anchor
- What's up?</i>

185
00:17:36,733 --> 00:17:39,531
<i>- Because I can 't dance and sing
- Hold it!</i>

186
00:17:39,733 --> 00:17:43,806
<i>I'm telling you, my broken friend
Put your hands in the air</i>

187
00:17:44,053 --> 00:17:48,205
<i>Like you just don 't care
I'm telling you, my broken friend</i>

188
00:17:48,453 --> 00:17:53,766
<i>- Can do most anything
- Cut it!</i>

189
00:17:53,973 --> 00:17:56,362
- Yeah!
- Cut it!

190
00:17:58,493 --> 00:18:02,486
- Curse my natural showmanship!
- You big fat fraud!

191
00:18:02,733 --> 00:18:05,964
- You're not really broken!
- But you will be!

192
00:18:06,213 --> 00:18:09,091
Bum rush the stage!

193
00:18:12,333 --> 00:18:15,769
- Get him!
- Get him!

194
00:18:22,493 --> 00:18:26,566
Oh, harsh!
I didn't get my beads!

195
00:18:28,893 --> 00:18:33,489
You, minion, lift up my arm.
After him!

196
00:18:41,933 --> 00:18:46,961
Everyone, prepare to get your guts
kicked out by folk singers.

197
00:19:08,973 --> 00:19:11,726
What is this, the Year of the Jerk?!

198
00:19:14,133 --> 00:19:18,888
The Golden Gate Bridge! Put the metal
to the pedal to the other metal!

199
00:19:24,453 --> 00:19:26,330
I forgot it's a hoverbridge!

200
00:19:26,533 --> 00:19:30,048
- I forgot this isn't a hover car!
- Is that a problem?

201
00:19:30,253 --> 00:19:33,131
Not if you've lived a life
without regret.

202
00:19:37,533 --> 00:19:41,765
- I'll save me!
- Quick, grab his foot cuffs!

203
00:19:51,893 --> 00:19:52,882
Bummer.

204
00:19:55,693 --> 00:19:59,402
Someone fat, get in my way!

205
00:20:06,533 --> 00:20:10,526
I'm broken again.
I can't move any part of me!

206
00:20:10,733 --> 00:20:13,122
- Good!
- I'm sorry I lied, Beck.

207
00:20:13,333 --> 00:20:17,849
I just wanted to make music with you.
I never meant to hurt anyone...

208
00:20:18,053 --> 00:20:22,843
...or help anyone.
- That's some played-out horsecrap!

209
00:20:23,093 --> 00:20:26,324
But I know you don't mean it.
Apology accepted.

210
00:20:26,533 --> 00:20:31,049
- So I can keep the check?
- Over my dead career.

211
00:20:31,293 --> 00:20:33,966
Well, it was worth a shot.

212
00:20:41,533 --> 00:20:44,445
If you're done scamming Beck,
we're heading home!

213
00:20:44,653 --> 00:20:49,602
All right. Let me just do one thing
to cheer myself up.
