00:00:07,373 --> 00:00:09,364
Futurama [5x07] - Teenage Mutant Leelas Hurdles

2
00:00:36,013 --> 00:00:38,732
Pazoozoo, you ungrateful gargoyle!

3
00:00:38,933 --> 00:00:42,687
I put you through college,
and this is how you repay me?

4
00:00:45,053 --> 00:00:47,408
Let's get this gargoyle
hunt on the road.

5
00:00:47,613 --> 00:00:51,765
Driving gloves, driving goggles,
driving thong. There!

6
00:00:52,133 --> 00:00:53,805
Maybe I should drive.

7
00:00:54,933 --> 00:00:56,286
You? A woman?

8
00:00:56,453 --> 00:00:59,889
I'm trying to catch a monster,
not find the quickest route to the mall.

9
00:01:00,893 --> 00:01:02,531
Let me just adjust the seat.

10
00:01:08,333 --> 00:01:12,451
My God, he's gonna do it! Everyone,
seat belts to maximum buckling!

11
00:01:30,773 --> 00:01:33,412
Pazoozoo?

12
00:01:34,453 --> 00:01:37,047
Pazoozoo?

13
00:01:37,253 --> 00:01:40,131
Hey, Grandpa!
Move your wrinkly old keister!

14
00:01:41,853 --> 00:01:43,127
Shut up!

15
00:01:43,333 --> 00:01:44,766
For heaven's gate!

16
00:01:44,933 --> 00:01:49,131
This ship can do 99 percent light speed.
Why are we going 35 miles an hour?

17
00:01:49,333 --> 00:01:51,369
Because we're in a hurry, that's why!

18
00:01:51,573 --> 00:01:53,484
Plus, you have the high beams on!

19
00:01:55,293 --> 00:01:56,612
I can't quite read the sign.

20
00:02:02,773 --> 00:02:04,843
Pazoozoo?

21
00:02:05,013 --> 00:02:07,243
Pazoozoo!

22
00:02:21,173 --> 00:02:25,086
Oh, it's 2:30. We can still catch
the early-Bird dinner special.

23
00:02:25,333 --> 00:02:27,449
Aren't we looking for your gargoyle?

24
00:02:28,293 --> 00:02:29,567
My what?

25
00:02:30,213 --> 00:02:34,126
Hello, Mavis. Surprised to
see me back again so soon?

26
00:02:34,293 --> 00:02:35,408
Mavis is dead.

27
00:02:35,573 --> 00:02:39,646
I expect you'll want to see my angry,
crotchety, grandpa discount card?

28
00:02:40,333 --> 00:02:43,928
Sir, this card has expired.
But it's good for a lifetime.

29
00:02:44,133 --> 00:02:45,532
Well, yours expired.

30
00:02:47,773 --> 00:02:51,482
Oh, Lord! Teeth do not belong
in your pants, professor.

31
00:02:51,693 --> 00:02:56,209
Well, I can't keep them in my mouth,
they're nuclear-Powered!

32
00:02:58,573 --> 00:03:00,370
Ow! It bit my finger.

33
00:03:00,533 --> 00:03:03,286
No! No! It's tasted human blood!

34
00:03:07,773 --> 00:03:10,731
Mm. Damn good meat.

35
00:03:17,293 --> 00:03:20,763
Professor, we've talked it over,
and everybody thinks you're too old.

36
00:03:21,773 --> 00:03:24,845
We've decided to do the merciful thing,
and have you youth-A-Sized.

37
00:03:25,013 --> 00:03:26,605
Dear God, no!

38
00:03:26,813 --> 00:03:30,522
Relax, professor. Youth-A-Sizing
is a trendy new spa treatment.

39
00:03:30,693 --> 00:03:32,843
It's this season's
shark-Cartilage enema!

40
00:03:33,053 --> 00:03:34,486
But I like being old!

41
00:03:34,653 --> 00:03:38,566
I don't have to talk to my parents,
no one asks me to help move their stuff

42
00:03:38,733 --> 00:03:42,282
I don't need to understand
today's "edgy" TV sitcoms.

43
00:03:42,493 --> 00:03:46,691
Okay, okay. We're not gonna force you
until I finish this sentence. Get him!

44
00:03:46,853 --> 00:03:49,048
Ah! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh-Ooh-Ooh!

45
00:03:49,333 --> 00:03:50,732
My thong!

46
00:04:01,093 --> 00:04:03,766
Hi! I'm Heather,
your personal youth-A-Sizer.

47
00:04:03,933 --> 00:04:06,891
Let's get started with a nice
botulism treatment, shall we?

48
00:04:07,093 --> 00:04:09,561
Go to hell, Heather!
Oh .

49
00:04:11,533 --> 00:04:15,162
In small doses, botulism toxin
tightens and tones the facial muscles...

50
00:04:15,373 --> 00:04:18,490
Instead of killing you in the
most horrible fashion imaginable.

51
00:04:22,493 --> 00:04:24,961
Give me back my floppy face!

52
00:04:27,453 --> 00:04:29,171
Careful with the giblets!

53
00:04:29,333 --> 00:04:32,245
You're still retaining a
lot of grump in these joints.

54
00:04:32,413 --> 00:04:33,926
More pressure.

55
00:04:35,253 --> 00:04:37,369
Ahhh.

56
00:04:40,853 --> 00:04:44,368
Since this is such a serious case of old,
we'll try our strongest treatment:

57
00:04:44,533 --> 00:04:47,445
A soothing, full-Body
bath in searing hot tar.

58
00:04:49,253 --> 00:04:52,484
Sir, it's not necessary
or wise to be naked.

59
00:04:53,373 --> 00:04:56,445
You sound just like
my tennis instructor.

60
00:04:59,533 --> 00:05:02,093
The tar blisters the age
right out of the body...

61
00:05:02,253 --> 00:05:05,051
In what top scientists
suspect is a miracle.

62
00:05:07,693 --> 00:05:09,126
I don't have time for this!

63
00:05:09,293 --> 00:05:12,808
I have to go buy a single piece of
fruit with a coupon and then return it...

64
00:05:12,973 --> 00:05:15,612
Making people wait behind
me while I complain.

65
00:05:15,813 --> 00:05:18,373
He still sounds sort of old,
sort of real old.

66
00:05:18,573 --> 00:05:20,404
Step aside, lady.

67
00:05:20,573 --> 00:05:22,006
Like everything else in life...

68
00:05:22,173 --> 00:05:25,370
Pumping is just a primitive,
degenerate form of bending.

69
00:05:26,813 --> 00:05:30,522
Whoa. Whoa-Oa. Whoa!

70
00:05:31,493 --> 00:05:34,485
Come on, Bender!
Pump harder! Harder!

71
00:05:34,653 --> 00:05:36,530
I'm trying as hard as I can.

72
00:05:36,693 --> 00:05:38,331
Harder, damn you!

73
00:06:00,133 --> 00:06:02,522
Well, that was an utter waste of time.

74
00:06:04,213 --> 00:06:08,092
Professor, it worked!
You look young enough to be my father!

75
00:06:08,293 --> 00:06:09,885
Poodle spit!

76
00:06:12,293 --> 00:06:14,204
Fifty-Three years old?

77
00:06:14,373 --> 00:06:18,366
Oh, now I'll need a fake
ID to rent ultra-Porn.

78
00:06:18,573 --> 00:06:21,292
Cool, professor.
We should go out and celebrate!

79
00:06:28,373 --> 00:06:32,605
Dear Lord! You've all reverted
to your childhood forms!

80
00:06:32,813 --> 00:06:36,886
Hooray!
I'm a teenage heartthrob again.

81
00:06:41,173 --> 00:06:43,607
While I try to restore
our normal ages...

82
00:06:43,773 --> 00:06:48,369
I expect you all to go about your
jobs like responsible professionals.

83
00:06:51,253 --> 00:06:53,562
It wasn't me, Mr. F. It was Amy.

84
00:06:54,493 --> 00:06:56,802
Stop it, Amy!
You stink!

85
00:06:56,973 --> 00:06:58,326
You know you did it!

86
00:06:59,733 --> 00:07:02,088
Quiet! Quiet, I say!

87
00:07:04,973 --> 00:07:07,726
We're here to take my little
stub of a husband home.

88
00:07:07,893 --> 00:07:10,851
Hermes, say goodbye to Mr. Farnsworth.

89
00:07:11,053 --> 00:07:13,044
Goodbye, Mr. Dumbsworth!

90
00:07:14,573 --> 00:07:18,009
Hey! This is my chance to
spend time with my parents too.

91
00:07:18,173 --> 00:07:21,210
But your parents are
gross sewer mutants. Ow!

92
00:07:23,413 --> 00:07:24,732
When I was an orphan...

93
00:07:24,893 --> 00:07:27,168
I wished I could grow
up with my mom and dad.

94
00:07:27,333 --> 00:07:30,052
And now, thanks to being
hurled backwards in time--

95
00:07:30,253 --> 00:07:33,325
That's not what happened!
Shut up and go live with your parents!

96
00:07:46,533 --> 00:07:48,569
It's gonna be totally awesome, Mom!

97
00:07:48,773 --> 00:07:52,163
You and me can bake, and argue about
my hairstyle hiding my pretty face...

98
00:07:52,373 --> 00:07:55,729
And if some kid picks on me,
my dad can beat up his dad!

99
00:07:55,933 --> 00:07:58,401
Can't I just beat up the kid?

100
00:07:59,173 --> 00:08:01,368
Well, okay, Leela.

101
00:08:01,533 --> 00:08:04,525
If you think you can put up with
your father, then welcome home.

102
00:08:04,693 --> 00:08:07,002
We'll try to respect your
independence and freedom.

103
00:08:07,173 --> 00:08:09,971
No! I want the real teen experience.

104
00:08:10,133 --> 00:08:12,408
Chores, curfew, the works!

105
00:08:12,613 --> 00:08:16,049
Fine, sweetiekins, we'll be
the strictest parents ever.

106
00:08:16,213 --> 00:08:18,647
Now, let's all have some
tequila to celebrate!

107
00:08:18,853 --> 00:08:20,650
Dad, I'm underage!

108
00:08:20,853 --> 00:08:23,162
Oh, right.
Here's a silly straw.

109
00:08:28,053 --> 00:08:31,170
Oh, my Amy is sweet little girl again.

110
00:08:31,573 --> 00:08:33,803
This like a mother's dream!

111
00:08:33,973 --> 00:08:37,761
Bad dream, that is. At this rate,
I'm never gonna get a grandchild!

112
00:08:37,973 --> 00:08:41,045
Maybe she not grown up,
but she sure grown out. She fat!

113
00:08:41,213 --> 00:08:44,205
Dad, if you're gonna make fat
jokes till I get cute again...

114
00:08:44,373 --> 00:08:46,170
I'm just gonna stay in my room!

115
00:08:46,373 --> 00:08:50,252
Stay in room? You so fat,
you gonna stay all around room.

116
00:08:53,573 --> 00:08:57,532
I've got to find a way to escape
the horrible ravages of youth.

117
00:08:57,733 --> 00:09:01,362
Suddenly, I'm going to the bathroom
like clockwork, every three hours.

118
00:09:01,533 --> 00:09:04,843
And those jerks at Social
Security stopped sending me checks.

119
00:09:05,013 --> 00:09:07,129
Now I have to pay them!

120
00:09:07,333 --> 00:09:09,528
I'm tired of you yapping!

121
00:09:12,933 --> 00:09:16,289
All you ever do is complain.
You never try to make things better.

122
00:09:16,493 --> 00:09:19,451
Well, I'm running away
from this dead-End family.

123
00:09:19,613 --> 00:09:23,322
I know there's a place for
people like me, with new ideas.

124
00:09:23,493 --> 00:09:25,802
There has to be!
Fine. Get going.

125
00:09:26,013 --> 00:09:30,325
Oh, I'm going, and you're gonna be all,
"Where's Bender? I miss Bender! "

126
00:09:30,533 --> 00:09:32,330
We won't know that until you leave.

127
00:09:32,533 --> 00:09:36,003
Oh, I'm leaving.
There's the door.

128
00:09:37,573 --> 00:09:38,892
I'll be good.

129
00:09:41,973 --> 00:09:45,124
Ah. Do you have to shed
your skin on the couch?

130
00:09:45,293 --> 00:09:46,442
What do we live in, a zoo?

131
00:09:47,813 --> 00:09:49,531
I'm getting the doorbell.

132
00:09:50,293 --> 00:09:51,646
For me?

133
00:09:52,933 --> 00:09:56,323
Hello, sir. It's a lovely
evening you have tonight.

134
00:09:56,493 --> 00:09:58,165
I'm here to pick up your daughter.

135
00:09:58,413 --> 00:10:01,086
Hi, Fry. I like your blazer.

136
00:10:01,253 --> 00:10:03,847
Thanks. These aren't pockets,
they're just flaps.

137
00:10:04,013 --> 00:10:05,890
I put my money in my sock.

138
00:10:07,933 --> 00:10:10,049
So where are you taking
my daughter tonight?

139
00:10:10,253 --> 00:10:12,972
A movie.
A movie, ma'am.

140
00:10:14,253 --> 00:10:17,689
Well, whatever you're really doing,
don't wake us if you get in after 12.

141
00:10:17,893 --> 00:10:20,168
Dad, you're being too lenient again.

142
00:10:20,333 --> 00:10:22,130
I have to be back by 11.

143
00:10:22,333 --> 00:10:24,483
Okay, okay! You're the boss.

144
00:10:24,693 --> 00:10:26,012
No, I'm not!

145
00:10:30,973 --> 00:10:33,407
I'd like a sewer burger,
but without the rat feces.

146
00:10:33,573 --> 00:10:35,450
What, are you on a diet?

147
00:10:37,613 --> 00:10:39,331
Leela, you look hot.

148
00:10:39,493 --> 00:10:42,849
Jeez, Moose. Just dump me right
in front of her, why don't you.

149
00:10:43,053 --> 00:10:45,806
Moose, Mandy, this is my friend Fry...

150
00:10:46,013 --> 00:10:47,366
From the surface.

151
00:10:47,573 --> 00:10:50,292
Oh, so this is the famous Fry.
What is he...

152
00:10:50,453 --> 00:10:53,968
Like, the biggest loser on the surface
so he has to hang out in the sewer?

153
00:10:54,173 --> 00:10:56,084
They're onto me!
Hey, come on

154
00:10:56,293 --> 00:10:57,965
Let's act like grownups here.

155
00:10:58,133 --> 00:11:00,488
Wanna race?
Yeah.

156
00:11:19,493 --> 00:11:24,044
Theres. The world's drinkings
water is safes for another days.

157
00:11:24,213 --> 00:11:27,171
Whoas! Cripe!

158
00:11:36,533 --> 00:11:38,091
A tapeworm!

159
00:11:40,333 --> 00:11:42,722
We missed the turn!
We'll never catch them.

160
00:11:42,893 --> 00:11:47,330
Yes, we will. This sewer goes right
under Planet Express, and it's 9 p.m.

161
00:11:49,173 --> 00:11:52,131
The devil take this predictable colon!

162
00:12:01,733 --> 00:12:03,007
All right!
Whoo-Hoo!

163
00:12:04,653 --> 00:12:06,803
Leela, you can stop winning now, we won!

164
00:12:07,013 --> 00:12:08,605
I can't reach the hand brake!

165
00:12:12,853 --> 00:12:14,366
That's detention.

166
00:12:16,973 --> 00:12:19,612
And then a giant tapeworm
tried to play us for chumps...

167
00:12:19,813 --> 00:12:21,451
But we totally dissed Moose.

168
00:12:21,653 --> 00:12:24,486
Yes, I'd like to meet this Moose.

169
00:12:24,653 --> 00:12:26,928
But in the meantime, I have good news!

170
00:12:27,093 --> 00:12:29,288
I may have solved our age problem.

171
00:12:29,493 --> 00:12:31,245
Yay!

172
00:12:31,773 --> 00:12:36,483
It seems the youth-A-Sizing tar was
saturated with time-Altering kronatons.

173
00:12:36,693 --> 00:12:39,332
A thin layer is still
stuck to our DNA...

174
00:12:39,533 --> 00:12:42,843
As well as Bender's robo, or "RNA. "

175
00:12:43,053 --> 00:12:44,327
Question.
Yes?

176
00:12:44,493 --> 00:12:46,165
You stink.

177
00:12:46,373 --> 00:12:49,809
Yes, yes. Anyhow, I've designed
an oil-Eating bacterium...

178
00:12:49,973 --> 00:12:52,567
That should take the tar right off.

179
00:12:52,733 --> 00:12:55,452
Come on. Let's go tell Leela
so we can grow up together.

180
00:12:58,613 --> 00:13:01,127
Thanks, professor,
but I don't want the treatment.

181
00:13:01,333 --> 00:13:03,210
Don't you understand, you little nitwit?

182
00:13:03,373 --> 00:13:07,002
Unless you're treated soon,
the only way to restore your true age...

183
00:13:07,173 --> 00:13:10,927
Will be to grow into it,
just as God intended.

184
00:13:11,133 --> 00:13:14,569
He has a point, honey.
What about your job and your friends?

185
00:13:14,733 --> 00:13:17,452
Do you really want to
abandon your old life?

186
00:13:17,613 --> 00:13:20,764
My old life wasn't as glamorous
as my web page made it look.

187
00:13:20,973 --> 00:13:23,885
All I ever wanted was
to grow up here with you.

188
00:13:24,333 --> 00:13:28,121
Please?
Well, if it's what you really want.

189
00:13:28,333 --> 00:13:29,925
It is, I know it is.

190
00:13:32,333 --> 00:13:34,085
I'll miss you, Leela.

191
00:13:34,253 --> 00:13:37,370
I'll come back and visit
when I'm all grown up.

192
00:13:37,533 --> 00:13:40,809
Bring beer.
No beer till you finish your tequila!

193
00:13:41,893 --> 00:13:44,805
The age-Restoring microbes are ready.

194
00:13:44,973 --> 00:13:47,646
Everyone into the
bacterial spew chamber.

195
00:13:49,213 --> 00:13:51,852
Yes, everyone do the same thing.

196
00:13:53,853 --> 00:13:56,845
Initiating controlled infection.

197
00:14:02,573 --> 00:14:06,282
I'm no doctor, but this
machine guy could use a lozenge.

198
00:14:10,733 --> 00:14:13,372
Ah, poo! We're even younger!

199
00:14:18,333 --> 00:14:20,893
Damn! The bacteria
pigged out on the tar...

200
00:14:21,053 --> 00:14:23,044
And now they're getting freaky deaky...

201
00:14:23,253 --> 00:14:25,608
Spreading kronatons
throughout our systems!

202
00:14:25,773 --> 00:14:27,365
We're getting younger by the minute!

203
00:14:28,893 --> 00:14:32,806
What? I'm gonna revert
through all my larval stages?

204
00:14:33,013 --> 00:14:35,846
Word. We'll all keep getting
younger and younger...

205
00:14:36,013 --> 00:14:39,130
Until we suffer a fate worse than death:

206
00:14:39,293 --> 00:14:42,968
Pre-Life! Then death.

207
00:14:56,173 --> 00:14:59,051
I've got to stop this reverse
aging before we all shrivel up...

208
00:14:59,213 --> 00:15:01,443
And suffer the agony of un-Birth!

209
00:15:01,653 --> 00:15:03,803
Think, you disco duck, think!

210
00:15:03,973 --> 00:15:06,851
What's that squirmal under your shirt?

211
00:15:07,093 --> 00:15:10,244
Oh. Get off me, you parasitic lamprey!

212
00:15:10,693 --> 00:15:13,048
Oh, sure, you need all your blood!

213
00:15:16,693 --> 00:15:18,046
Would you all chill?

214
00:15:18,253 --> 00:15:21,290
I can't think with you
kids cramping my style!

215
00:15:21,853 --> 00:15:23,730
I need a babysitter.

216
00:15:24,213 --> 00:15:26,443
Okay, quiet time.

217
00:15:28,933 --> 00:15:33,165
I know, everyone pretend a goblin ate
your tongues, and I'll read you a story.

218
00:15:34,053 --> 00:15:35,566
Yeah, a story!

219
00:15:35,773 --> 00:15:38,492
I can't see from down here, I can't!

220
00:15:39,093 --> 00:15:40,367
There.

221
00:15:40,533 --> 00:15:42,763
Today's story is from Muteen Magazine.

222
00:15:42,933 --> 00:15:46,687
Who would you rather hear about,
Four-Legged Chachi or Tentacle Chachi?

223
00:15:46,893 --> 00:15:49,123
I want to hear a space story!

224
00:15:50,653 --> 00:15:53,770
It's kind of a baby book,
but okay. Let's see.

225
00:15:54,213 --> 00:15:56,522
"Snow White Dwarf and
the Seven Red Dwarfs."

226
00:15:56,693 --> 00:16:00,402
"Charlotte's Tholian Web."
"The Fountain of Aging."

227
00:16:02,613 --> 00:16:05,047
The Fountain of Aging? Hm.

228
00:16:05,213 --> 00:16:06,885
It is just a legend.

229
00:16:07,093 --> 00:16:11,689
Still, they called the Tooth Fairy a
legend, and now he's head of the FBl!

230
00:16:14,053 --> 00:16:15,372
What's up? Kids ready?

231
00:16:16,253 --> 00:16:18,323
Yay! Professie's back!

232
00:16:19,253 --> 00:16:21,813
Ew. You smell like smoking.

233
00:16:21,973 --> 00:16:23,292
And drinking!

234
00:16:23,493 --> 00:16:26,326
I had a few beers,
but I'm cool to drive.

235
00:16:26,533 --> 00:16:28,603
I wish I could come with
you to say goodbye...

236
00:16:28,773 --> 00:16:30,968
Before you all turn
back into grownups...

237
00:16:31,133 --> 00:16:33,522
But I'm grounded for
knocking the school over.

238
00:16:33,693 --> 00:16:36,810
Who cares, Leela?
It was just a public school.

239
00:16:36,973 --> 00:16:38,884
Now, go with your friends, please.

240
00:16:39,093 --> 00:16:42,688
No! A grounded teenager
must be confined to her room!

241
00:16:43,733 --> 00:16:45,530
Until she sneaks out.

242
00:16:50,173 --> 00:16:52,812
When I grow up,
I wanna be a steam shovel!

243
00:16:57,413 --> 00:17:00,291
According to this, the fountain
is located in the darkest...

244
00:17:00,453 --> 00:17:04,048
Most ancient region of space,
just past Teddy Bear Junction.

245
00:17:04,213 --> 00:17:08,525
Teddy Bear Junction,
the worst scum-Hole in the galaxy.

246
00:17:11,653 --> 00:17:14,486
This solar system is, like, way old!

247
00:17:14,653 --> 00:17:17,451
Look how high the asteroid belt
is pulled up on that planet!

248
00:17:17,613 --> 00:17:18,887
News flash:

249
00:17:19,093 --> 00:17:22,847
Everything's getting older the closer
we get to that ancient, burnt-Out sun.

250
00:17:23,013 --> 00:17:26,483
Dude, the Fountain of Aging
must be on the sun itself!

251
00:17:26,693 --> 00:17:28,684
Shut up! I was gonna say that.

252
00:17:41,813 --> 00:17:44,930
We've got to hurry.
The kids have only one change of pants.

253
00:17:49,493 --> 00:17:53,645
We gotta be real, real careful
to stay in just long enough...

254
00:17:53,813 --> 00:17:55,804
To make us our right ages again.

255
00:17:59,373 --> 00:18:01,170
Zoidberg, get out of there!

256
00:18:01,373 --> 00:18:05,286
The current!
It's too much already! Help!

257
00:18:10,093 --> 00:18:11,367
Jeepers!

258
00:18:11,533 --> 00:18:15,526
Zoidberg is dead!
Zoidberg's brother is dead.

259
00:18:15,733 --> 00:18:19,772
Funny story. I just reverted to the
age when my siblings budded from me...

260
00:18:19,933 --> 00:18:23,084
And my brother Norman split
off and jumped in the fountain.

261
00:18:23,253 --> 00:18:26,370
He always had to be
the center of attention!

262
00:18:27,333 --> 00:18:28,652
Let him go.

263
00:18:29,453 --> 00:18:31,569
Oh, no!

264
00:18:35,933 --> 00:18:38,845
Quick! Get them into the fountain!

265
00:18:40,693 --> 00:18:42,684
Thanks for the help, Leela.

266
00:18:42,853 --> 00:18:46,368
Once we're growed up,
you can go back to your family.

267
00:18:46,533 --> 00:18:48,808
We'll never bother you again.

268
00:18:49,413 --> 00:18:51,210
Well, you could bother me a little.

269
00:18:54,653 --> 00:18:56,530
It's working! Hooray!

270
00:18:56,693 --> 00:18:58,524
I can't hold on!

271
00:19:01,933 --> 00:19:03,651
I'm coming in after you!

272
00:19:03,813 --> 00:19:06,327
No, Leela!
You can't give up your childhood.

273
00:19:06,493 --> 00:19:09,883
You'll never have another chance at it!

274
00:19:34,213 --> 00:19:36,283
We did it!
We're the right ages again!

275
00:19:36,493 --> 00:19:38,404
I think I might be a
couple years younger!

276
00:19:38,573 --> 00:19:40,768
Oh, me too!

277
00:19:42,093 --> 00:19:43,492
Help!

278
00:19:43,693 --> 00:19:46,924
I'm still in mid-Peril, you clods!

279
00:19:47,133 --> 00:19:49,169
He's too far out!
We can't reach him!

280
00:19:49,373 --> 00:19:54,367
With my last breath,
I curse Zoidberg!

281
00:20:08,053 --> 00:20:09,850
Pazoozoo!

282
00:20:10,013 --> 00:20:12,083
You came back to me.

283
00:20:15,013 --> 00:20:17,766
Are you back to your
original age, professor?

284
00:20:20,613 --> 00:20:22,569
Even older! Huzzah!

285
00:20:24,053 --> 00:20:26,487
I'm sorry you had to give
up being a kid, Leela.

286
00:20:26,693 --> 00:20:30,447
Well, I guess every adult wants
to be a kid again sometimes.

287
00:20:30,613 --> 00:20:32,604
But I worked hard to be the person I am.

288
00:20:32,813 --> 00:20:35,327
The fabulous person.
With friends like you guys.

289
00:20:35,493 --> 00:20:37,211
Fabulous friends.

290
00:20:37,493 --> 00:20:41,008
And I'm really happy
I have that life back.

291
00:20:41,213 --> 00:20:46,333
And you, my faithful fiend,
how can I ever repay you?

292
00:20:47,253 --> 00:20:51,212
And that, little one,
is how Papa gained his freedom.

293
00:20:51,373 --> 00:20:53,682
Now, bonne nuit.

294
00:20:53,853 --> 00:20:56,651
Bonne nuit to you all.
