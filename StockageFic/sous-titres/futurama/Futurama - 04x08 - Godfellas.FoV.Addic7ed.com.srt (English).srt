1
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:09,276
Futurama [4x08] - Godfellas - CiWaN

2
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:47,388
Space pirates!
Space pirates?

3
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,875
You know, pirates, but in space.

4
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:00,799
<i>Avast, mateys.</i>

5
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,918
Electronically transfer
your space doubloons...

6
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:08,232
Afore I send thee to
Davey Jarg's locker!

7
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:15,669
Hey! Keep it down, you kids!
I'm trying to take a nap!

8
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:27,512
Come on. Come on.

9
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,435
Make Bender take a nap in a tube.

10
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:40,876
Come back when I've
had some sleep, baby.

11
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:50,877
Fry to battle stations.
Fire torpedo three.

12
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:54,038
Firing torpedo number three.

13
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,388
What?

14
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:05,791
That's not torpedo three!
Not at all!

15
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:09,748
Damn you, Fry and Lee... la!

16
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:16,313
Too late I realize that me
children are me only real treasures.

17
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:22,869
Help! Mechanical man overboard!

18
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:24,911
Go after him, Leela.

19
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,679
We were going full speed
when we fired him...

20
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,831
So he's going faster than that.

21
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,993
We can't catch him even if we
rub the engine with cheetah blood?

22
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:38,191
I don't know how to say this...

23
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:42,239
But Bender is doomed to
drift through space. Forever.

24
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:47,835
He always wanted to drift forever...

25
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,798
But through the American Southwest.

26
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:54,839
I'm going too fast.
I've gotta lose momentum.

27
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:09,631
I'm gonna spend eternity alone
with barely any swag. Ooh!

28
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:15,916
Hey universe, check out
the dude with the Rolex.

29
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:21,439
Wow, ostentatious. Except what
good is a candelabra without...?

30
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:24,438
Wait, I know.

31
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,153
Ah, the pity.

32
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:33,472
Fated to drift forever through
the void as gravity's plaything.

33
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:36,473
Oh, cruel fate, to be thusly boned.

34
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:41,669
Ask not for whom the bone bones.
It bones for thee.

35
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:45,269
The only thing that keeps me sane...

36
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:51,629
Is the thought that I have all
eternity in which to perfect my art.

37
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:57,231
Ah! Damn you!

38
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:15,078
Now, when I'm found in a million years,
people will know what the score was.

39
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:18,073
Hey, what's bombarding me?

40
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:20,591
Oh, no, an asteroid field.

41
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:24,833
If even a pea-Sized asteroid
goes through my skull...

42
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:27,355
It could hurt slightly.

43
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:35,230
Well, that was fun.
Now for eons of loneliness.

44
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:38,115
Eh?

45
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:51,829
Fellow Shrimpkins, behold him
that hath taken us onto his breast.

46
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,798
<i>Holy frijoles.</i>

47
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,028
All bow before the great Metal Lord.

48
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:05,638
Worshipers? This ought to liven
up my endless tragic voyage.

49
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:15,678
All hail the Metal Lord.
So hailed.

50
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:19,395
Those peewees think I'm God, huh?
Hard to blame them.

51
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:27,034
I am the Metal Lord. Who are you?
I am called Malachi.

52
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:30,596
It means "He who really
loves the Metal Lord."

53
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:35,954
Listen here, time for a religious
donation. Hand over your wallet!

54
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,754
But we are a poor and simple folk.

55
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:41,753
Poor? Oh, crap!

56
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:49,429
Pity me not, for I am richened
by the love of my family.

57
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:56,034
What art thou doing, Malachi Jr.?
I'm practicing to hug Daddy.

58
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:00,880
Gag unto me with a spoon.

59
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:04,032
It's time I laid down
a few commandments.

60
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:08,319
You got a chisel?
Take this down. Number one...

61
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,472
Behold, the one commandment:

62
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,512
Make it a double!

63
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:20,276
Can you find him, professor?
The Smell-A-Scope isn't strong enough.

64
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:26,436
Bender's odor is so mild,
it's being overpowered by local sources.

65
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:29,717
Hooray!
People are paying attention to me.

66
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:37,915
Fry, we brought someone to cheer you up.

67
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:42,949
His name is Helper. He is eager
to be your new best friend.

68
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,190
Hello, chum. Miss your buddy?

69
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,191
Have a pudding pop.
No, l...

70
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:50,511
Want to go to an amusement park?
Well, okay.

71
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:54,559
Have fun. Hey, I heard Bender's back.
What? Really?

72
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:58,514
No. I just thought you would
enjoy that for a moment.

73
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:18,072
Microbrewed. My guys did all right.

74
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:22,632
I think I'll make my countenance
to shine down upon them.

75
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:29,118
Good work. There's no slowing
down with the Metal Lord tonight.

76
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:34,440
Yes, tonight is kind of special.
Did you rip off your arm as a joke?

77
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:39,873
Nay. Like most of your followers,
I was maimed building the great brewery.

78
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:44,872
Others died from the
fumes it spewed forth.

79
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:50,399
And, of course, the liquor
industry attracted organized crime.

80
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,672
It's all my fault.

81
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:07,314
Malachi, tell thy people that
the Lord is moved by their plight.

82
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:30,474
Malachi Jr.! No!
Daddy, I can't hold much longer.

83
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:36,317
My arms are tired from hugging.
Save him. Save my son, Metal Lord.

84
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:39,239
This looks like a job for God.

85
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:51,671
What the...? Malachi, what manner
of deal is this with the chanting?

86
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:56,510
They saw you save my son.
Now everyone prays for their own miracles.

87
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,756
Very well. What do they want?

88
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:02,839
The people of that
village pray for wealth.

89
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:16,513
That was a practice miracle.
Who's next?

90
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,392
They pray for sunlight

91
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:23,553
So their barley might make
a more refreshing beer.

92
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:27,395
Very well. Let there be light.

93
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:33,232
Yippee!
Hooray!

94
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:38,429
I got it. I got it.

95
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:46,429
When you're writing the Bible, you
might want to omit that last miracle.

96
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:53,596
He decided not to let go.

97
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,869
I can't believe you're gone.
I won't!

98
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:04,874
If I can't reach you physically,
I'll try something crazy.

99
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,879
That's my story,
Father Changstein el Gamahl.

100
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:18,717
Can religion help me find my friend?
We could join together in prayer.

101
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:22,549
But is there anything useful we can do?
No.

102
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:28,632
Sure, I hold s? Ance, channel your
friend. No problem. Insert coin.

103
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:34,513
I am your friend, Bonder.

104
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:40,113
Bonder? Is it really you?
Yes. I am fine. Give the gypsy $10.

105
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:44,711
Wait, Bender's name isn't Bonder,
it's Bender. You're a fraud.

106
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:48,993
You want false hope or not?
Only if there's no real hope.

107
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:54,519
There is perhaps one way. Have you
heard of the Monks of the Shubah?

108
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:58,235
I've not heard of them.
They are an ancient order...

109
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:01,870
That believes God exists
in the depths of space.

110
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:05,157
They have built a
powerful radio telescope...

111
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:08,118
High in the Himalayas to search for him.

112
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:12,074
They'd let me use it to find Bender?
What am I, psychic?

113
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:15,038
I mean, yes.
I'm sure they will. Yes.

114
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:33,752
Oh, Metal Lord, hear my prayer!

115
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:36,315
Yes, Malachi. What is it this time?

116
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:40,035
The infidels on your back
no longer believe in you.

117
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,509
They say their prayers go unheeded.

118
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:47,077
How am I supposed to hear
prayers coming out of my ass?

119
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:52,189
They talk of war against the faithful.
I beseech thee, rise up against them.

120
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:55,318
Smite someone who deserves it for once.

121
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:58,870
Every time I interfere,
I only make things worse.

122
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:03,318
It's best to solve your own problems.
But Metal Lord...

123
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:07,149
What part of nay
doesn't thou understand?

124
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:14,075
I'm outfitting an expedition to
the Himalayas. I'll need a coat.

125
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:20,196
I miss Bender almost half as
much as you do, but it's hopeless.

126
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:23,312
You can't give up hope
just because it's hopeless.

127
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:27,234
You gotta hope even more and cover
your ears and go, "Blah, blah!"

128
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:30,950
I'd also like a pack mule!
At once, sir!

129
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:36,109
Well, you won't listen to reason...

130
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:39,113
So I'll listen to
idiotic-Ness and come too.

131
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,476
But we'll need a Sherpa to guide us.

132
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:50,670
Now that's one Bible
that doesn't disappoint.

133
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:55,834
Looks like society's running pretty
well without my meddling in...

134
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:05,237
Atomic bombs? Those unbelievers from
my backside found my nuclear pile.

135
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:08,432
Fear not, Lord.
We shall be with you soon.

136
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:11,757
This is the maximum
level of being with me!

137
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:18,035
We will solve our own problems.
It is time to convert the unbelievers.

138
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,754
Convert them?
To radioactive vapor!

139
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:35,034
Look, Daddy, I'm hugging God.

140
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:40,396
Maybe if I hug him real hard,
he'll save us from...

141
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,472
No!

142
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:45,234
Oh, it tickles.

143
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:58,238
Hello? Is anyone still alive?
How about in the porno theater?

144
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,833
Don't be embarrassed.

145
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:04,552
They're dead. All dead.

146
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:10,752
Who would have known playing God
could have such terrible consequences?

147
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:22,398
If I die of exhaustion, make sure my
body freezes in a dignified position.

148
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:25,120
None of that "huddled for warmth" crap.

149
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:32,998
Behold! The monastery of the Shubah.

150
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:36,038
I must leave.
I am not holy enough to enter.

151
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,633
Okay.

152
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:46,593
Looks rickety. We'd better test it.

153
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,837
<i>Welcome to our monastery.</i>

154
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:59,357
<i>Please stand to one side
to let faster pilgrims by.</i>

155
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:15,469
Hey! That galaxy's signaling in binary.
I've gotta signal back!

156
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:20,031
But I only know enough binary to
ask for the bathroom. Speak English?

157
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:22,839
I do now.

158
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:30,309
What are you, a galactic computer?

159
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:34,359
Possible. I am user-Friendly,
my good chum.

160
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:37,080
Who built you?
I have always been.

161
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:41,074
Oh, my God! Are you God?

162
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:45,910
Possible. I do feel compassion for
all living things, my good chum.

163
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:51,434
But why would God think in binary?
Unless you're not God...

164
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:55,952
But the remains of a computerized
space probe that collided with God!

165
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,878
That seems probable.

166
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:06,238
A member of our brotherhood sits
at the controls constantly...

167
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:09,233
Scanning the heavens for God.

168
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:12,557
There he is! No. No, wait. No.

169
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:15,877
How long have you been at it?
700 years.

170
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:19,237
We've not yet examined one
ten-Millionth of the sky.

171
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:23,632
We will find the Almighty,
even if it takes to the end of time.

172
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:27,037
And then what?
Then we utter unto him a short prayer.

173
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:30,755
See, the telescope is also
an amplifying transmitter.

174
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:33,753
Like a giant karaoke machine?
Not really.

175
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:38,311
Want to see our giant karaoke machine?
Not really.

176
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,836
Finding God, that's important...

177
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:45,835
But it might be a treat if you let me
use the telescope to find my friend.

178
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:49,470
I don't know what to say,
other than absolutely not!

179
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:53,997
Your loss is tragic, but our work...
You can look for God forever.

180
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:57,391
I'm just asking for one
lifetime to find my friend!

181
00:16:57,560 --> 00:17:02,270
He speaks out of love for his friend.
Perhaps that love is God.

182
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:07,548
How convenient. A theory about God
that doesn't require a telescope.

183
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:09,278
Get back to work!

184
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:11,715
That telescope is as
much mine as anybody's!

185
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:15,310
I'll use it with or without permission!

186
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:22,469
Your order may be famous for martial
arts, but I can clobber any holy man.

187
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:25,871
Actually, we only practice
martial arts as meditation.

188
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:28,031
We are strictly nonviolent.

189
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:31,749
Then get in the laundry room,
or I'll kick your butts!

190
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:37,115
Oh, this is the worst crazy
sect I've ever been in.

191
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:41,273
Do you know what I'll do before I do it?

192
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,908
Yes.
What if I do something different?

193
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:46,833
Then I don't know that.
Cool, cool.

194
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:52,234
A lot of people pray to you, huh?
Yes, but so many ask so much...

195
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,948
After a while, you just tune it out.

196
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,191
You know, I was God once.

197
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:00,750
Yes, I saw. You were doing
well until everyone died.

198
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:04,999
It was awful. I tried helping them.
I tried not helping them.

199
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:09,950
In the end, I couldn't do any good.
Do you think what I did was wrong?

200
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:13,908
Right and wrong are words.
What matters is what you do.

201
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:18,551
Yeah, I know. That's why I asked
if what I did... Oh, forget it.

202
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:21,069
Bender, being God isn't easy.

203
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:26,030
Do too much, people get dependent.
If you do nothing, they lose hope.

204
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:30,318
You must use a light touch,
like a safecracker or a pickpocket.

205
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,914
Or a guy who burns a
bar for insurance money!

206
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:35,674
Yes, if you make it look
like an electrical thing.

207
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:41,438
When you do things right, people won't
be sure you've done anything at all.

208
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:46,395
Does that mean you wouldn't send
me to Earth, even if I prayed?

209
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:49,831
Earth? Which way is that?

210
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:52,319
I don't know.

211
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:54,912
Bender? Bender?

212
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:59,468
Let us out! We cooked our
shoes in the dryer and ate them.

213
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:01,358
Now we're bored!

214
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:07,149
<i>Has anyone out there seen Bender?
No! Quit asking!</i>

215
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:12,238
It's been three days. Even if
you stay the rest of your life...

216
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:17,269
There is virtually no chance of
finding him. It's time to give up.

217
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:21,433
You're right.
I'm never gonna see him again.

218
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:25,555
I know he was evil, and on
more than one occasion...

219
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:28,951
He actually stole my blood.

220
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:33,113
But still, I wish I had Bender back.

221
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:37,675
<i>I wish I had Bender back!</i>

222
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:40,309
Huh?

223
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:44,517
What? You say something?
No. No.

224
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:49,435
Well, so long.
Remember what we talked about.

225
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,118
Hot! Hot! Hot!

226
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:09,790
Bender! It's a miracle!

227
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:17,032
This is, by a wide margin,
the least likely thing ever to happen.

228
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:22,194
You'll never believe what happened!
First, I was God. Then I met God!

229
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,789
We locked up some monks!
Oh, no!

230
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:27,952
We forgot to let them
out of the laundry room!

231
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:31,874
Do we have to? They're monks.
Their God will let them out...

232
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:34,799
Or give them more shoes to eat.
Fat chance!

233
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:38,839
You can't count on God for jack!
He pretty much told me so!

234
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:43,630
Now come on! If we don't
save those monks, no one will!

235
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:59,115
When you do things right, people won't
be sure you've done anything at all.
