1
00:00:02,813 --> 00:00:06,806
Futurama <i>is brought to you</i>
<i>by Glagnar's Human Rinds.</i>

2
00:00:07,013 --> 00:00:10,688
<i>It's a Bunch-a-Munch-a-</i>
<i>Crunch-a-Humans!</i>

3
00:00:16,093 --> 00:00:18,163
I Second That Emotion

4
00:00:58,933 --> 00:01:01,493
Somebody likes snouts.

5
00:01:01,693 --> 00:01:03,126
Is it me?

6
00:01:06,413 --> 00:01:09,530
Oh, my head! My precious head!

7
00:01:12,533 --> 00:01:16,845
Stupid can opener! You killed
my father and now you want me!

8
00:01:17,053 --> 00:01:19,806
- You all right, Bender?
- I guess so.

9
00:01:20,013 --> 00:01:24,450
But why do we keep this time bomb
around for that dumb animal?

10
00:01:24,653 --> 00:01:27,690
Don't yell at him.
You hurt his feelings.

11
00:01:27,933 --> 00:01:30,731
- Come on, pet him and make up.
- No.

12
00:01:31,013 --> 00:01:33,129
I said, pet him.

13
00:01:33,373 --> 00:01:37,844
I'll pet him.
I'll pet him with both hands!

14
00:01:38,093 --> 00:01:40,243
My ass! Get off! Get off!

15
00:01:40,493 --> 00:01:43,690
- Are you okay?
- Nothing a lawsuit won't cure.

16
00:01:43,893 --> 00:01:45,326
Not you.

17
00:01:47,893 --> 00:01:50,532
Poor baby chipped a fang.

18
00:01:51,933 --> 00:01:55,562
I got a busted ass!
I don't see anyone kissing it!

19
00:01:55,773 --> 00:01:58,128
All right, I'm coming.

20
00:02:09,453 --> 00:02:14,288
Remember, Rover gets the pill,
and Pepper gets the suppository. Next!

21
00:02:20,573 --> 00:02:23,326
It's just a broken fang. Not serious.

22
00:02:23,533 --> 00:02:26,730
What's that? You have to put him down?

23
00:02:26,933 --> 00:02:28,446
No. Huh? What?

24
00:02:28,653 --> 00:02:31,406
Terrible shame. Shall I do the honors?

25
00:02:33,413 --> 00:02:34,528
No!

26
00:02:36,293 --> 00:02:39,603
- You about done?
- Next time, I'm keeping it.

27
00:02:39,813 --> 00:02:43,726
I have a replacement fang
for your pet in the next room.

28
00:02:53,333 --> 00:02:57,770
The jaguar wasn't helpful,
but he did knock one of my teeth out.

29
00:02:57,973 --> 00:02:59,531
Now, then.

30
00:03:02,293 --> 00:03:05,524
What are these rings
in Nibbler's fang?

31
00:03:06,093 --> 00:03:10,484
I'm woozy from a gazelle kick earlier,
but if he's like a tree...

32
00:03:10,693 --> 00:03:13,082
...the rings might indicate his age.

33
00:03:13,293 --> 00:03:17,286
Good luck. It'd take a genius
to count all those rings.

34
00:03:17,493 --> 00:03:18,608
He's 5.

35
00:03:21,013 --> 00:03:24,164
Happy birthday, young Nibbler.

36
00:03:24,693 --> 00:03:27,810
Look how cuddly he looks
in his new cape.

37
00:03:28,013 --> 00:03:30,732
I'd be cuddly if someone
gave me a cape.

38
00:03:31,053 --> 00:03:33,851
Who's playing pin the tail
on the maggot?

39
00:03:34,053 --> 00:03:37,125
Me! Everyone watch how good I am!

40
00:03:51,413 --> 00:03:55,122
And the crowd goes wild!
What prize do I get? Cash?

41
00:03:55,333 --> 00:03:56,891
Look at Nibbler.

42
00:03:58,773 --> 00:04:00,968
Oh, he's holding a spoon.

43
00:04:01,173 --> 00:04:04,324
- He's so talented.
- You call that talent?

44
00:04:04,533 --> 00:04:09,323
Gather around old Bender and get ready
for the show of a lifetime.

45
00:04:21,733 --> 00:04:26,249
- Now he's wearing a hat!
- Let's all sing "Happy Birthday"!

46
00:04:26,493 --> 00:04:28,802
W<i>hat day is today?</i>

47
00:04:29,053 --> 00:04:31,328
<i>It's Nibbler's birthday</i>

48
00:04:31,573 --> 00:04:34,406
W<i>hat a day for a birthday</i>

49
00:04:34,653 --> 00:04:36,723
<i>Let's all have some cake</i>

50
00:04:36,973 --> 00:04:39,567
<i>And you smell like one too</i>

51
00:04:42,773 --> 00:04:44,729
What about this?

52
00:04:45,533 --> 00:04:48,730
Bender, aren't you cooking
for this party?

53
00:04:48,933 --> 00:04:53,723
- Fine. We'll have rack of Nibbler!
- Just make a cake. And this time...

54
00:04:53,933 --> 00:04:57,926
...if someone jumps out of it,
put them in after it's cooked.

55
00:04:58,133 --> 00:05:00,408
So it's a cake you want, is it?

56
00:05:00,613 --> 00:05:04,447
I'll make you a cake
you'll never forget.

57
00:05:09,093 --> 00:05:13,769
That'll take care of those rats.
Now, to bake a cake so delicious...

58
00:05:13,973 --> 00:05:17,886
...they'll have no choice
but to love and worship me.

59
00:05:45,493 --> 00:05:49,611
There! This'll teach those
filthy bastards who's lovable.

60
00:05:49,853 --> 00:05:55,052
Once I spell check it,
it'll be ready for my admiring public.

61
00:06:00,413 --> 00:06:02,131
No! Get away from there!

62
00:06:09,533 --> 00:06:11,364
That's it.

63
00:06:13,333 --> 00:06:15,722
Happy birthday!

64
00:06:20,013 --> 00:06:21,844
Bender, what's going...?

65
00:06:23,413 --> 00:06:24,812
No!

66
00:06:25,053 --> 00:06:27,692
Can't you see I'm using the toilet?

67
00:06:33,933 --> 00:06:37,130
How could you flush Nibbler
down the toilet?

68
00:06:37,333 --> 00:06:41,372
Step one, I lifted the seat.
That was the first annoyance.

69
00:06:41,573 --> 00:06:43,325
Am I right, men?

70
00:06:43,733 --> 00:06:48,170
Aren't you upset at all? What if
I flushed Fry down the toilet?

71
00:06:48,413 --> 00:06:50,722
Only one way to find out.

72
00:06:51,133 --> 00:06:53,693
You have no sympathy for anyone!

73
00:06:53,893 --> 00:06:56,851
Sure I do!
Right now I feel sorry for you.

74
00:06:57,053 --> 00:07:01,126
- You do?
- Yeah. One cantaloupe-sized eye?

75
00:07:01,333 --> 00:07:04,723
You ain't winning
no beauty pageants, lady.

76
00:07:07,653 --> 00:07:11,726
And so we say goodbye
to our beloved pet, Nibbler...

77
00:07:11,933 --> 00:07:16,051
...who's gone to a place where I,
too, hope one day to go.

78
00:07:16,293 --> 00:07:17,931
The toilet.

79
00:07:28,053 --> 00:07:29,725
I wouldn't feel so bad...

80
00:07:29,973 --> 00:07:33,932
...if Bender just understood
the pain he caused me.

81
00:07:35,373 --> 00:07:38,683
<i>Give it to me straight, doc.</i>
<i>Don 't sugarcoat it.</i>

82
00:07:38,893 --> 00:07:43,171
<i>Your entire family died when a plane</i>
<i>piloted by your fiancée...</i>

83
00:07:43,373 --> 00:07:48,128
<i>... crashed into your uninsured home.</i>
<i>And you have inoperable cancer.</i>

84
00:07:49,853 --> 00:07:52,242
Bet you didn't expect that one!

85
00:07:52,453 --> 00:07:55,331
Does he not understand
humanoid emotion?

86
00:07:55,533 --> 00:07:58,889
I just wish Bender could feel
exactly what I feel.

87
00:07:59,093 --> 00:08:02,563
Through the miracle of science,
that can be done.

88
00:08:02,773 --> 00:08:06,163
Is this another experiment
that crosses a line...

89
00:08:06,413 --> 00:08:08,529
...man was not meant to cross?

90
00:08:09,333 --> 00:08:12,848
<i>The official death toll</i>
<i>in that tragic rocket crash...</i>

91
00:08:13,053 --> 00:08:15,726
<i>... has now been raised to 54,000.</i>

92
00:08:17,573 --> 00:08:20,371
What the hell are you doing
with my head?

93
00:08:20,573 --> 00:08:24,532
- I need to tinker in it.
- Just use a potted plant like Fry!

94
00:08:24,733 --> 00:08:27,691
<i>Q</i>uiet, you.
I'm installing an empathy chip.

95
00:08:27,893 --> 00:08:30,327
To allow Bender to feel emotions?

96
00:08:30,533 --> 00:08:34,048
Yes, if by "allow" you mean "force. "

97
00:08:34,253 --> 00:08:35,971
- Son of... Careful!
- Oh, dear.

98
00:08:36,213 --> 00:08:39,762
Oh, my. I got it. Who wants more?

99
00:08:40,013 --> 00:08:43,130
- Professor!
- Steady, now. There we go.

100
00:08:44,813 --> 00:08:49,523
Now I'll simply tune it
to Leela's emotional frequency.

101
00:08:50,293 --> 00:08:54,172
My God, I'm overcome with feelings.

102
00:08:54,373 --> 00:08:57,092
I'm experiencing
a powerful yearning...

103
00:08:57,293 --> 00:09:00,126
...to cram my gullet
with mackerel heads.

104
00:09:00,333 --> 00:09:02,528
That's me, baby.

105
00:09:03,733 --> 00:09:06,008
I feel I'm not as smart as Leela...

106
00:09:06,213 --> 00:09:09,728
...but I also feel relieved
that I'm cuter than her.

107
00:09:09,933 --> 00:09:12,572
- That's me.
- Thanks for covering.

108
00:09:13,653 --> 00:09:17,566
Now I miss Nibbler,
and I feel nosy and opinionated.

109
00:09:17,773 --> 00:09:18,922
- Bingo!
- It's her!

110
00:09:19,133 --> 00:09:22,762
Thanks. I'm happy Bender can finally
feel my pain.

111
00:09:22,973 --> 00:09:27,728
Happy. I like this feeling.
Don't revert to your usual mopey self.

112
00:09:27,933 --> 00:09:30,049
I'm not mopey. You shut up!

113
00:09:30,253 --> 00:09:33,165
Anger, huh?
How dare you make me feel anger...

114
00:09:33,373 --> 00:09:36,331
...you one-eyed jerk with a dead pet?

115
00:09:45,253 --> 00:09:49,292
Thanks for taking me out.
I'm now slightly less miserable.

116
00:09:49,493 --> 00:09:52,769
You know what'd cheer you up?
Getting a puppy!

117
00:09:52,973 --> 00:09:54,531
A puppy?

118
00:09:54,813 --> 00:09:57,725
Nibbler loved to eat puppies.

119
00:10:00,413 --> 00:10:03,530
- What's your problem?
- I miss Nibbler.

120
00:10:03,733 --> 00:10:06,884
- You do?
- Hell, no! It's Leela's feelings!

121
00:10:07,093 --> 00:10:11,325
Why can't she just drink herself happy
like a normal person?

122
00:10:19,733 --> 00:10:23,646
- Jealousy. You think you're so hot!
- Wha...?

123
00:10:23,893 --> 00:10:27,966
You only get all the guys
because you dress like a tramp!

124
00:10:28,173 --> 00:10:30,733
They're responding to my personality!

125
00:10:31,733 --> 00:10:36,011
Armando and I are going
to the back seat of his car for coffee.

126
00:10:36,213 --> 00:10:41,412
- Will you be all right by yourself?
- Sure, I'm having a great time. Really!

127
00:10:41,613 --> 00:10:44,332
You two go enjoy yourselves.

128
00:10:45,133 --> 00:10:49,729
I'm so Ionely. I'm gonna go eat
a bucket of ice cream.

129
00:10:50,013 --> 00:10:52,573
A bucket of...

130
00:10:52,773 --> 00:10:55,048
The spoon's in the foot powder!

131
00:11:03,453 --> 00:11:05,250
I'm at the end of my rope.

132
00:11:05,453 --> 00:11:08,968
I can't live another minute
without sweet Nibbler.

133
00:11:09,173 --> 00:11:13,007
Alligators can live in sewers
after you flush them.

134
00:11:13,213 --> 00:11:14,441
- Really?
- Yep.

135
00:11:14,693 --> 00:11:19,528
My friend's cousin's caseworker
saw one. It's a widely believed fact.

136
00:11:19,893 --> 00:11:21,087
Sewers...

137
00:11:21,293 --> 00:11:23,568
Thinking, thinking, thinking.

138
00:11:24,373 --> 00:11:28,525
Hang on, Nibbler!
Uncle Bender's coming to save you!

139
00:11:30,853 --> 00:11:32,491
Damn, it's too small.

140
00:11:32,693 --> 00:11:35,924
What did those humans
design this for anyway?

141
00:11:39,493 --> 00:11:40,562
Ah-ha!

142
00:11:40,773 --> 00:11:43,924
Bender, one. Toilet, zero.

143
00:11:46,493 --> 00:11:50,532
See you on the other side!

144
00:11:50,773 --> 00:11:52,172
Bender? Bender?!

145
00:11:53,213 --> 00:11:55,568
Have you seen my sombrero?

146
00:11:59,853 --> 00:12:02,242
He flushed himself down the toilet?

147
00:12:02,453 --> 00:12:04,967
- Who's next?
- It's your fault.

148
00:12:05,173 --> 00:12:07,846
Your emotions made him feel bad.

149
00:12:08,053 --> 00:12:10,123
You're right. I feel terrible.

150
00:12:10,333 --> 00:12:12,893
Now you're making him feel worse!

151
00:12:13,093 --> 00:12:15,482
We better go down and find him.

152
00:12:15,693 --> 00:12:18,412
Are you crazy? There's mutants there!

153
00:12:18,613 --> 00:12:22,128
- They'll eat you alive!
- They're hideous!

154
00:12:23,733 --> 00:12:27,248
Mutants are just a ridiculous
urban myth.

155
00:12:27,453 --> 00:12:29,330
Don't be so sure.

156
00:12:29,533 --> 00:12:33,526
Many scientists believe humans
could mutate down there...

157
00:12:33,773 --> 00:12:37,607
...due to exposure to toxic waste,
radioactive runoff...

158
00:12:37,813 --> 00:12:40,168
...and good old American feces.

159
00:12:40,373 --> 00:12:42,967
God bless America.

160
00:12:49,933 --> 00:12:51,730
Ladies first.

161
00:12:55,213 --> 00:12:57,124
Oh, and the aftertaste.

162
00:13:01,853 --> 00:13:03,571
- What?
- I burned my finger!

163
00:13:04,653 --> 00:13:08,692
- Check the guidebook.
- We're under Park Avenue. Ritzy!

164
00:13:10,773 --> 00:13:15,528
Just think. All this was probably
once a charity luncheon for the Met.

165
00:13:15,733 --> 00:13:17,963
Wait, what's that?

166
00:13:18,213 --> 00:13:20,647
Why did I throw out the manual?

167
00:13:20,853 --> 00:13:23,572
You didn't have to come down here.

168
00:13:23,773 --> 00:13:28,130
I know, but I just missed
Nibbler so much.

169
00:13:29,013 --> 00:13:32,050
- He was so cute.
- He was so sweet.

170
00:13:33,253 --> 00:13:36,325
This emotional display
is making me nauseous.

171
00:13:36,533 --> 00:13:38,205
Or maybe it's from that.

172
00:13:38,973 --> 00:13:40,770
Nibbler!

173
00:13:43,733 --> 00:13:46,327
It's no use. We'd better turn back.

174
00:13:46,533 --> 00:13:48,125
Which way, Fry?

175
00:13:48,333 --> 00:13:52,929
According to this map,
the only exit is through that pipe.

176
00:13:54,813 --> 00:13:56,883
It gets wider after a mile.

177
00:13:57,333 --> 00:13:58,448
- Idiot.
- Idiot.

178
00:13:58,653 --> 00:14:00,609
Okay, never mind.

179
00:14:00,813 --> 00:14:03,725
I'll just ask those people
for directions.

180
00:14:05,573 --> 00:14:07,131
Mutants!

181
00:14:14,493 --> 00:14:17,132
Mutants! They're real!

182
00:14:18,293 --> 00:14:20,523
I'll take care of this!

183
00:14:20,773 --> 00:14:22,525
Back! Back!

184
00:14:24,853 --> 00:14:26,206
Thanks, handsome.

185
00:14:26,413 --> 00:14:29,644
- Don't worry, we're harmless.
- I have three arms!

186
00:14:29,853 --> 00:14:34,085
- I said, harmless not armless!
- Lay off him. He only has one ear.

187
00:14:34,293 --> 00:14:37,171
Shouldn't you eat my brain?
You're mutants!

188
00:14:37,373 --> 00:14:40,490
Mutants? Perhaps you are the mutants.

189
00:14:40,693 --> 00:14:44,003
Dwayne, have you looked
in a mirror lately?

190
00:14:45,493 --> 00:14:48,326
Welcome to our village.
It's not Paris...

191
00:14:48,533 --> 00:14:52,446
...but it has a charm
that I wouldn't trade for the world.

192
00:14:52,653 --> 00:14:57,124
- You do realize you live in a sewer.
- Perhaps your civilization...

193
00:14:57,373 --> 00:15:00,809
...is the sewer of an even greater
society above you.

194
00:15:01,013 --> 00:15:04,164
- No, we're on top.
- Daylight and everything.

195
00:15:04,373 --> 00:15:06,170
It must be wonderful!

196
00:15:07,013 --> 00:15:11,689
We came down here to find our pet.
He was flushed down the toilet

197
00:15:11,893 --> 00:15:15,647
If he was flushed,
he probably came through here.

198
00:15:15,853 --> 00:15:19,129
Everything always does. Follow me.

199
00:15:20,053 --> 00:15:23,125
All that is ours
came from your toilets.

200
00:15:23,333 --> 00:15:27,121
Over there is our aquarium.
This is our library.

201
00:15:27,333 --> 00:15:29,608
Just crumpled porn and Ayn Rand.

202
00:15:29,813 --> 00:15:31,804
Over here is our church.

203
00:15:33,653 --> 00:15:36,850
You guys worship an unexploded
nuclear bomb?

204
00:15:37,053 --> 00:15:41,729
Nobody's that observant.
It's mainly for Christmas and Easter.

205
00:15:41,933 --> 00:15:43,332
Nibbler!

206
00:15:43,533 --> 00:15:46,047
Come to Daddy, sweetie-ookums!

207
00:15:46,293 --> 00:15:49,444
Do alligators flushed down
toilets live here?

208
00:15:49,653 --> 00:15:51,450
That's an urban legend.

209
00:15:51,653 --> 00:15:53,803
- Then what are those?
- Crocodiles.

210
00:15:54,013 --> 00:15:55,241
They're our pets.

211
00:15:55,453 --> 00:15:59,651
When they grow too large,
we flush them into the sub-sewer.

212
00:15:59,853 --> 00:16:02,526
There's a race of sub-mutants there.

213
00:16:02,733 --> 00:16:05,645
Please! That's just
a sub-urban legend.

214
00:16:05,893 --> 00:16:10,330
Then I suppose you also don't believe
in El Chupakneebray.

215
00:16:11,773 --> 00:16:14,924
El Chupakneebray? What's that?

216
00:16:18,293 --> 00:16:21,888
Gather around for the legend
of El Chupakneebray.

217
00:16:22,093 --> 00:16:24,607
<i>He creeps in the midnight hush</i>

218
00:16:24,813 --> 00:16:27,327
<i>Silent as a low-flow toilet flush</i>

219
00:16:27,533 --> 00:16:29,364
<i>But sooner or later</i>

220
00:16:29,613 --> 00:16:32,446
<i>He'll eat you whole</i>
<i>And half your alligator</i>

221
00:16:32,653 --> 00:16:34,086
- Crocodile.
- Whatever.

222
00:16:34,293 --> 00:16:37,171
Our pet, Nibbler, loves fresh crocodile.

223
00:16:37,373 --> 00:16:41,002
It's his favorite treat.
He must be El Chupakneebray.

224
00:16:41,213 --> 00:16:42,328
Hey, yeah!

225
00:16:42,533 --> 00:16:45,172
You unleashed
El Chupakneebray upon us?

226
00:16:45,373 --> 00:16:47,568
Then you are our sworn enemies!

227
00:16:50,093 --> 00:16:54,166
He would never hurt people.
Let us help you capture him.

228
00:16:54,373 --> 00:16:59,128
Impossible. If legend's true, our
only hope is to give a snack-rifice!

229
00:16:59,333 --> 00:17:01,483
Yes, an unspoiled virgin.

230
00:17:01,693 --> 00:17:03,888
- I volunteer!
- Nice try, Leela...

231
00:17:04,093 --> 00:17:07,529
...but we've all seen
Zapp Brannigan's web page.

232
00:17:09,093 --> 00:17:11,527
Oh, I made myself feel bad.

233
00:17:11,733 --> 00:17:14,088
- She'll do.
- Chain her to the post!

234
00:17:15,493 --> 00:17:17,723
And rip her shirt a little.

235
00:17:19,693 --> 00:17:23,925
Behold! When El Chupakneebray
comes for the, uh, "virgin"...

236
00:17:24,133 --> 00:17:26,693
...he will be snared
by this rope trap.

237
00:17:26,893 --> 00:17:29,965
El Chupakneebray comes soon.
It is nightfall.

238
00:17:30,173 --> 00:17:33,131
Nightfall? How can you tell down here?

239
00:17:34,173 --> 00:17:37,848
- The tide is coming in.
- <i>Q</i>uiet. The beast approaches.

240
00:17:52,853 --> 00:17:55,845
Nibbler! Come here, precious.

241
00:17:56,053 --> 00:17:58,726
Look, everyone. It's El Chupakneebray.

242
00:17:58,933 --> 00:18:00,810
- That's not him.
- Say what?

243
00:18:01,053 --> 00:18:03,328
That's El Chupakneebray!

244
00:18:08,533 --> 00:18:10,728
I'll take care of this!

245
00:18:19,013 --> 00:18:21,527
- Do something!
- I'm too scared!

246
00:18:21,733 --> 00:18:24,850
Your fear is being
transmitted to Bender!

247
00:18:25,053 --> 00:18:27,692
If you care about Nibbler,
stop caring!

248
00:18:27,893 --> 00:18:30,248
I can't! I love all creatures!

249
00:18:30,453 --> 00:18:31,886
- Even me?
- As a friend.

250
00:18:32,093 --> 00:18:33,526
Damn.

251
00:18:33,893 --> 00:18:36,930
Listen to me.
I'm an expert at not caring.

252
00:18:37,133 --> 00:18:40,489
The secret is not giving
a rat's ass about anyone...

253
00:18:40,693 --> 00:18:43,571
...and only caring about things
that you want...

254
00:18:43,773 --> 00:18:46,890
...that you deserve,
that the world owes you!

255
00:18:48,333 --> 00:18:51,928
- Well, I could use a new tank top.
- Bigger! Bigger!

256
00:18:52,133 --> 00:18:56,968
A fashionable tank top! And designer
boots encrusted with jewels!

257
00:18:57,173 --> 00:18:59,926
You'll need some pants
to go with that!

258
00:19:00,133 --> 00:19:05,161
And I could afford it all if I didn't
have to feed that stupid Nibbler!

259
00:19:05,373 --> 00:19:08,251
Bender is back!
I'll save you, Nibbler!

260
00:19:17,693 --> 00:19:20,446
- He'll be killed!
- Know what else I could use?

261
00:19:20,653 --> 00:19:23,804
A weekend at a fancy spa.
And a Toblerone.

262
00:19:42,453 --> 00:19:43,681
You did it!

263
00:19:46,053 --> 00:19:49,170
- Let's have a tissue-tape parade!
- No, thanks.

264
00:19:55,813 --> 00:19:59,123
Gather around to hear
the legend of Bender.

265
00:19:59,373 --> 00:20:02,331
<i>He came from above with a...</i>

266
00:20:02,973 --> 00:20:06,852
It'll be ages before another
guitar string is flushed.

267
00:20:09,573 --> 00:20:13,009
- That's a disgusting story.
- All thanks to Bender.

268
00:20:13,213 --> 00:20:15,852
- I love you, Bender.
- I love you too.

269
00:20:16,053 --> 00:20:20,092
Get that stupid chip out of me
before I kill myself.

270
00:20:22,653 --> 00:20:26,965
You won't believe this,
but the empathy chip burned out.

271
00:20:27,173 --> 00:20:30,563
The emotion you felt for Nibbler
was your own!

272
00:20:30,773 --> 00:20:32,809
So Bender learned a lesson...

273
00:20:33,053 --> 00:20:37,251
...about respecting other people's
feelings after all.

274
00:20:37,453 --> 00:20:41,526
No, I'm wrong. The chip was running
at triple capacity.

275
00:20:41,733 --> 00:20:46,523
And I still barely felt anything.
Good night, losers!

276
00:20:47,653 --> 00:20:50,292
Maybe Bender didn't learn from me...

277
00:20:50,493 --> 00:20:53,087
...but I learned something from him.

278
00:20:53,573 --> 00:20:55,165
So long, jerkwads!

279
00:20:55,373 --> 00:20:57,523
So long!
