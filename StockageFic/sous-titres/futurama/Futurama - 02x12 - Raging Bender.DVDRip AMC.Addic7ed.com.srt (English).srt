1
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:09,230
Raging Bender

2
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:34,440
Good news, everyone!
I've taught the toaster to feel love.

3
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:42,512
Hermes returns from
his vacation today.

4
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:45,429
- Good morning.
- Hey, Hermes!

5
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:46,635
- Yo!
- My man!

6
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:50,668
- So how was it?
- Stopover on the Brain Slug planet.

7
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:53,957
Hermes liked it so much
he decided to stay.

8
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:58,199
Hermes has all the fun.
He's got a Brain Slug on his head!

9
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:02,871
- You're gonna get us assimilated.
- Switch to a garlic shampoo.

10
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:06,550
Today's mission is to go
to the Brain Slug planet.

11
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:10,230
- What'll we do?
- Walk around not wearing a helmet.

12
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:14,439
Sounds great, Hermes!
Whatever you say.

13
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:19,676
- Let's ditch him and go to the movies.
- Hey, yeah! Good idea.

14
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:22,189
I'm seeing a movie with friends.

15
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,032
Cool, let's see this one.

16
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:36,158
No. I'm not in the mood
for a documentary.

17
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:39,551
I've heard good things about
<i>Quizblorg, Quizblorg.</i>

18
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:43,036
I hate subtitles.
Alien films are so pretentious.

19
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:48,234
Fellows! How about a film we
can all enjoy? <i>Planet of the Clams.</i>

20
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:52,359
About an upside-down world
where lobster is slave to clam.

21
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,791
Who invited you?
Let's see <i>All My Circuits.</i>

22
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,228
I wanna see that.

23
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:58,919
Good point, Bender!

24
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:03,352
- A small slurm.
- For 25 cents less, get a super small.

25
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:05,437
Okay.

26
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:11,514
Oh, man!

27
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:16,829
Give me a large diet malt liquor
and a popcorn with extra motor oil.

28
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,919
Down in front!

29
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:28,191
<i>Glagnar's Human Rinds presents:</i>
This Week in the Universe.

30
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:32,951
- This is real futuristic.
- Don't talk during the movie.

31
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:36,470
<i>New New York mayor</i>
<i>C. Randall Poopenmeyer...</i>

32
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:40,838
<i>... opens a new tube line</i>
<i>to alleviate rush-hour traffic.</i>

37
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,832
Go, Masked Unit!

38
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:08,117
Hey, buddy? Yo!

39
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:12,279
- Mind taking your head off?
- I need it to watch the movie.

40
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:15,512
Ask Flabby here to describe
it to you later.

41
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:18,109
She is as the factory made her.

42
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:21,756
They should have stopped
about halfway through.

43
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:52,630
W<i>ell, that finishes this paperwork.</i>

44
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,034
<i>Calculon Enterprises.</i>

45
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:58,750
<i>A fight scene has broken out</i>
<i>at the warehouse!</i>

<i>Come</i> q<i>uickly, before an explosion</i>
<i>chases someone down a hallway.</i>

47
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,636

00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:12,079
<i>If you want Calculon to race to the</i>

<i>If you want Calculon to double-check</i>
<i>his paperwork, press 2.</i>

50
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:20,910
<i>- You have pressed 2.</i>
- I didn't!

51
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,076
<i>I'm almost positive you did.</i>

52
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:29,796
<i>Add in the carryover from form</i>
<i>16-A, then deduct line 2-B.</i>

53
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:37,630
Pardon me, sir.
But you seem to be kicking my seat.

54
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:40,638
"Pardon me, sir.
But you seem to be..."

55
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:44,991
That's the gist of what I said.
Would you mind?

56
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:47,236
Sure thing, pal.

57
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,315
Sir?

58
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,272
- Who threw that?
- That's it!

59
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:59,035
Sir, I challenge you to fisticuffs.

60
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,036
Oh, I'm boned.

61
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:10,829
Let's all go to the lobby!

62
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:20,829
I'm gonna open a pile of
whup-ass on you!

63
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:30,715
Do you know who that was?

64
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:38,037
Cripes! The Masked Unit!
You knocked him out cold!

65
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,833
Wow, I'm impressed!

66
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:44,633
I'm the commissioner
of Robot Fighting.

67
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:49,396
A connoisseur of jerks who pick
fights. And you're the biggest.

68
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:54,071
- You should see me at funerals.
- I want you in the League.

69
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:57,750
Ultimate Robot Fighting?
Sounds pleasant. I'll do it.

70
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:01,630
My hero!

71
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:06,838
They don't make movies
like this anymore.

72
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:14,997
I'm gonna be the greatest
robot fighter ever!

73
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:18,397
Float like a float-bot,
sting like a stinging machine!

74
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:23,799
You can't be a robot fighter. It's
the most brutal form of competition.

75
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,838
- It is?
- There are no rules.

76
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,674
Two robots enter,
one robot leaves.

77
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:32,037
The other leaves after being
declared the winner.

78
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:36,671
- That doesn't sound so bad.
- Did I mention the crippling pain?

79
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:39,673
I'm pretty sure I did.
Yes, definitely.

80
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:43,873
Crippling? That's not covered by
my insurance. Count me out.

81
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:47,874
You've got to do it.
I don't care how suicidal it is.

82
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:51,277
How come when I want to have fun
you're against it?

83
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:55,752
This is more important than that
marble-eating contest.

84
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,710
- Let me tell you a story.
- Oh, again with the orphanarium.

85
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:04,276
When I was growing up,
I got picked on a lot.

86
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:07,637
My only outlet was
Octouran Kung Fu.

87
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:16,428
Excellent. Bill, Keith,
you will go to championships.

88
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:19,359
Bill, congratulate Keith
when he wakes up.

89
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:22,791
But I can beat these dorks
with one eye closed.

90
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,878
Perhaps. There is more
to winning than that.

91
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:30,830
- You lack the will of a warrior.
- What do you mean? Watch this.

92
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:37,631
No girl has the will of a warrior.
You have the will of a housewife.

93
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:41,469
- At best, the schoolmarm.
- I'll take you on right now.

94
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:46,151
But I have the will of the warrior.
Therefore, the battle is over.

95
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,038
The winner?
Me!

96
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:52,552
Rematch? You lose again!
Had enough? I thought so!

97
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:59,629
I lost my chance.
I won't let you throw away yours.

98
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:03,037
She's right.
I don't want to end up like her!

99
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,077
Count me back in!

100
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:08,238
Let's see what you got.
Touch your toes.

101
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:15,754
Still can't reach!

102
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:35,599
Let's commence preparations
for rumbling!

103
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:45,832
Ladies and gentlemen and smizmars!

104
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,275
Welcome to tonight's main event.

105
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:54,834
From Mom's Friendly Robot Factory
in America's heartland, Mexico:

106
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,996
Bender!

107
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:06,919
And in this corner,
from and made of parts unknown:

108
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,750
The Clear Cutter!

109
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:17,271
- Bender rules!
- I got you a Bender hat.

110
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:21,832
Wow! Thanks, Hermes!
I... Hey, cut that out!

111
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:25,837
You can't hit what you can't see.

112
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:36,230
Get up. You can't quit every time
you get an ax in the back.

113
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:42,828
Or a drill through your face. <i>Q</i>uit
scratching your ax-hole and get back.

114
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:02,598
And the winner is...
Bender!

115
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:14,079
- Nice work out there, kid.
- He might be dead. I took a life!

116
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,192
Hi, boss. Yo, dude.

117
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:19,516
He's not dead!
What's up?

118
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:24,316
You didn't read the pamphlet?
Ultimate Robot Fighting is a scam.

119
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:29,071
Keep it under your head. But the most
popular robot always wins.

120
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:32,750
I'm not a great fighter?
I won because I'm popular?

121
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,639
- Bingo.
- Whoo-hoo, I'm popular!

122
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:39,031
You're pure lowest
common denominator.

123
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:42,113
Go Bender! Go Bender!
Go Bender!

124
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:48,552
Presenting Bender...

125
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,268
...The Offender!

126
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:56,634
I'm just an ex-con trying to go
straight and get my kids back.

127
00:10:58,800 --> 00:10:59,630
Versus...

128
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:02,638
...Billionaire Bot!

129
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:15,875
Versus...

130
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,838
...The Foreigner!

131
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:22,068
I'm not from here!
I have my own customs!

132
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:25,630
Look at my crazy passport!

133
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,069
Versus...

134
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:37,313
...The Chain Smoker!

135
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:41,557
I love smoking.
And after I win the fight...

136
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:45,634
...I'm headed straight to your
favorite restaurant.

137
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:02,632
You know, I'm also
an Ultimate Robot Lover.

138
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,156
You're three hours late.

139
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:08,432
You can't give up.
Both of us worked so hard.

140
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:10,790
- "We"?
- I said "us. "

141
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:15,516
Bender The Offender doesn't need you!
He doesn't need anybody.

142
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:20,959
- What about us, Mr. The Offender?
- Well, I need floozies. Let's roll.

143
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:34,035
Howdy, chief. What do you say I fight
these two bimbos in some mud?

144
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:36,316
We're going in a
different direction.

145
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:40,195
We wouldn't be fighting
in the conventional sense.

146
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:41,833
You're slipping.

147
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:46,039
Sales of Bender Brand
bath soaps are down 20 percent.

148
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:50,469
Those morons!
I said peaberry, not sandalwood!

149
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:54,229
If you can't move sandalwood,
you don't belong here!

150
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:58,678
- You'll lose next week's title match.
- But the crowd loves me.

151
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:01,838
Let's see how they feel
about your new persona.

152
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:05,277
- The Gender Bender!
- The most unpopular fighter...

153
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:08,557
...since Sergeant Feces Processor.

154
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:11,991
Oh, yeah?
What if I don't let the new guy win?

155
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:16,034
Then he'll just beat you the
old-fashioned way: To death!

156
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:18,635
Melissa, send in the new kid.

157
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:24,755
I am Destructor.

158
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,199
See you at the fight.

159
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:33,636
I said, "See you at the fight. "
And that's the story.

160
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:36,952
I thought it was real,
like pro wrestling.

161
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,076
But it's fixed, like boxing.

162
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:43,558
It's one thing to win a fixed fight.
There's dignity. But to lose?

163
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:46,439
And in this atrocity?

164
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:50,196
I can't do it.
You've gotta train me to win.

165
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:54,075
No! You wouldn't take my help
when you didn't need it...

166
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,719
...so why now?

167
00:13:55,920 --> 00:14:00,436
- What are you talking about?
- I don't know. But I'm not helping.

168
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:04,117
<i>You loved him as</i>
<i>Bender The Offender!</i>

169
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:07,630
<i>Get ready to hate him</i>
<i>as he threatens your sexuality...</i>

170
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:12,231
<i>... in his new persona:</i>
<i>The Gender Bender!</i>

171
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:15,230
<i>I'm a real toughie.</i>

172
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:19,513
<i>S</i>q<i>uaring off this Sunday</i>
<i>versus Destructor!</i>

173
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,629
<i>I will destroy you!</i>

174
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:27,038
<i>And stop calling me.</i>

175
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:29,515
<i>I am his trainer,</i>
<i>Master Funog.</i>

176
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:34,436
<i>He will be victorious for</i>
<i>he has the will of a warrior.</i>

177
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:36,079
Not Funog!

178
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:40,154
Let's hit the gym.
I'll teach you to fight like a girl!

179
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:44,632
I'll put on my tutu.

180
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:55,709
<i>Hello, and welcome to a remarkable</i>
<i>championship bout.</i>

181
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:59,037
<i>Destructor, a robotic armored tank...</i>

182
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:03,392
<i>... whose very use at battle has been</i>
<i>ruled a war crime...</i>

183
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:08,390
<i>... versus Gender Bender,</i>
<i>who wears a pink tutu.</i>

184
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:13,071
This is Rich Little imitating
Howard Cosell, here at ringside...

185
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:17,233
...with George Foreman.
George, a word in edgewise?

186
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:20,637
This could be the most
one-sided fight since 1973...

187
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:24,037
...when Ali faced an 80-foot tall
Joe Frazier.

188
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:28,034
My memory is not so good,
but I think the Earth was destroyed.

189
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:29,952
Interesting, if true.

190
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:34,955
The Vegas odds tonight stand at an
unprecedented 1000-0.

191
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:39,318
A bet of $0
on Bender pays $ 1000...

192
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:43,155
...if he wins.
Still, very few takers.

193
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,072
It's not a smart bet.

194
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:51,756
You're supposed to prance out and
tickle him with your fairy wand.

195
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,468
Instead, prance out
and kick his head off.

196
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:57,638
Got it.
Large kickle, hold the tickle.

197
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:02,353
- Thank God I'm free of that nightmare!
- Sorry. Here you go.

198
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,915
Thanks.
It was cold on the floor.

199
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:07,714
- Professor, I got you a program.
- Good.

200
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:11,037
Just let me put on my
reading glasses.

201
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:17,629
Why, Zoidberg! There's a lovely
photo of you in here!

202
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:26,399
In this corner, the confused young
robot with the golden curls...

203
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:30,395
...weighing 525 pounds...

204
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:33,751
...The Gender Bender!

205
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:39,916
Get that hippie out!

206
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:42,554
And in these two corners...

207
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:45,473
...weighing 400 tons...

208
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:50,430
...the gizmo from Pismo...
Beach!

209
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:53,912
Destructor!

210
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:01,432
We meet again. Girl who acts
like fighter, training fighter...

211
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:05,633
...who acts like girl.
- Keep laughing, Funog.

212
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:11,630
- Ready?
- I was built ready. Give me the bell.

213
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:13,518
Did you hear a noise?

214
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:26,032
Final boarding call
for Flight 406...

215
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:29,630
...non-stop service to pain.

216
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:33,837
Now boarding standby passengers...

217
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,117
It's a good time
to bring up my new grill.

218
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:48,235
With its patented design, the fat
drains directly into my mouth.

219
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:57,555
Fry! Throw in the towel!

220
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:02,118
For God's sakes, Fry.

221
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:09,239
That's exactly what I was thinking.

222
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:20,798
- Mommy!
- Funog, that's enough. Call him off.

223
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,070
Funog?

224
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:31,754
Why won't anyone help me?

225
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:41,720
So once more we meet again.

226
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:45,592
You're just controlling him
like a puppet.

227
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:48,872
I mean, cheating in a fake fight.
That's low.

228
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:52,629
Better than being a girl.
Like you. You're a girl!

229
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:56,839
Oh, right. Girls lack
the will of the warrior.

230
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:05,071
It's Bendering time!

231
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:08,238
Take this! And this!

232
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:14,631
You were an excellent student.
Too bad I was a lousy teacher.

233
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:24,197
I think you misunderstood
the concept of Bendering time.

234
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:29,149
See you in girl hell!
I'll be in boy hell, much nicer.

235
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:38,839
Yes!

236
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:41,038
Yes!

237
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,151
And the winner is:

238
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:49,039
Destructor!

239
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:53,479
I've not seen such a spectacle...

240
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:56,678
...in all my years
impersonating a sportscaster.

241
00:19:56,920 --> 00:20:02,552
Interesting side note: As a head
without a body, I envy the dead.

242
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:04,557
No argument here.

243
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:10,828
I heard somebody got flattened!

244
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:13,435
Fry, where's your brain slug?

245
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:17,439
Poor little guy starved to death.

246
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:21,036
I'm proud of you.
Sure, you lost. You lost bad.

247
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:26,519
But I beat up someone who hurt
my feelings in high school.

248
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:29,713
I'm in tremendous pain here.

249
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:33,954
Great job. You lost, and you made it
look almost half real.

250
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:38,273
Here's a card good for 10% off
at Bed Bath & Beyond.

251
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:45,429
Yes! I'm the greatest!
The greatest! Oh...

252
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,151
So ends the chronicle...

253
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:51,870
...of one of the greatest ever
to play the sport.

254
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:57,035
- He didn't look half bad in the tutu.
- That he did surely not.

255
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:58,229
What?

256
