1
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:10,799
Horsy to Pointy Guy Six.

2
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:19,798
Check.

3
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,596
Get him, boys!

4
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:26,435
Good move.

5
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:33,916
Brannigan Begins Again

6
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:59,233
Good news.

7
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:03,872
We have a mission to further
intergalactic peace.

8
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,992
- Nope. Watching cartoons.
- Sorry.

9
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,469
What's the mission?

10
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:11,558
A delivery for the Democratic
Order of Planets.

11
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:12,795
What's that?

12
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,913
It's like the United Nations
from your time, Fry.

13
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:20,994
Or like the Federation
from <i>Star Trek.</i>

14
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:24,511
Tonight's the ribbon cutting
for DOOP's new base.

15
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:28,998
- What are we delivering?
- Something necessary to the ceremony.

16
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:34,354
- The oversized scissors.
- We'll deliver them as fast as we can.

17
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,596
Okay. But don't run with them!

18
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:48,117
Wow, a million aliens. I've never seen
anything so mind-blowing!

19
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:53,509
- A reception table with muffins!
- Ladies and gentlemen.

20
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:58,197
Welcome to the ribbon cutting
for the DOOP's new headquarters.

21
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:03,190
A fitting home for an organization
that fosters peace everywhere.

22
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:07,598
Even between the Insectoids
and the Space Lizards.

23
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:15,909
- What's it like on Amazonia?
- Big rats there.

24
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:19,596
- Me crush with club.
- That's so interesting.

25
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,990
Why don't we have coffee together?

26
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:25,397
There's no better place
for a home of diplomacy...

27
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:28,194
...than here orbiting
the Neutral Planet.

28
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:31,797
What are your thoughts,
Your Neutralness?

29
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:36,039
I have no strong feelings one way
or the other.

30
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:40,715
I hate these filthy Neutrals.
You know where enemies stand.

31
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:45,397
But with Neutrals, who knows?
It sickens me.

32
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:50,956
Halt! Why, Leela!
I do believe we've met.

33
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:56,195
- He means you guys did it.
- We brought scissors for the ceremony.

34
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,795
- Then you're under arrest.
- Why?

35
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:02,237
How do I know these aren't part
of a Neutral plot?

36
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:05,512
They're not sharp. Who could I hurt?

37
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:09,196
The Yarn People of Nylar Four.

38
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:14,552
So a plan to assassinate
a weird-Iooking alien with scissors.

39
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:16,398
How very Neutral of you.

40
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:19,637
- What?
- It was almost the perfect crime.

41
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:24,032
But you forgot one thing:
Rock crushes scissors.

42
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,836
But paper covers rock.
And scissors cuts paper.

43
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:31,675
Kif, we have a conundrum.
Search them for paper.

44
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:34,030
- And bring me a rock.
- Why?

45
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:38,439
So beautiful, yet so Neutral.

46
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,511
Drag them to the ship!

47
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:44,071
To cut the ribbon, the legendary
DOOP captain...

48
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:47,590
...who just returned from a
carpet-bombing of Eden Seven...

49
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,400
...Zapp Brannigan.

50
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:02,028
What makes a man turn Neutral?
Lust for gold? Power?

51
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:05,272
Or were you born
with a heart of Neutrality?

52
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:08,711
Sir? You should be cutting
the ribbon now.

53
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:12,873
No matter. I'll simply cut it
from here with the ship's laser.

54
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:17,798
That may not be wise.

55
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:23,239
Kif, I don't need your
that-may-not-be-wise attitude.

56
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:48,396
Whoopsie-daisy.

57
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:56,556
You are accused of blowing up
DOOP headquarters. How do you plead?

58
00:04:56,760 --> 00:05:01,834
- Absolutely 99 percent not guilty.
- The prosecutor will call a witness.

59
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:07,279
Your Honor, I'm a simple hyper-chicken
from a backwoods asteroid...

60
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:12,794
...but if it please the court,
I'll call the entire jury.

61
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:18,310
- I'll allow it.
- Members of the jury...

62
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,391
...did you all happen to gander...

63
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:24,195
...at who blew up that there
DOOP headquarters?

64
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,879
That's the guy there.

65
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:30,312
- Are you gonna vote to convict him?
- You better believe it.

66
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:33,634
The jury will disregard its testimony.

67
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,834
Your Honor, the prosecution rests.

68
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:40,350
The evidence against Brannigan
is strong.

69
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:45,350
But, in light of his service,
and this incompetent prosecutor...

70
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:48,791
...I'm afraid I must dismiss
all charges.

71
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:54,148
What? Your Honor, I know the case
is closed and you've given a verdict...

72
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:57,511
...but I want to testify.
- I'll allow it.

73
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:00,440
Miss Leela, on the date in question...

74
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:04,229
...were you or weren't you
wearing a skirt?

75
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:09,918
That's a dumb question. What matters
is Zapp's the worst captain ever.

76
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:13,994
I saw him blow up DOOP headquarters
with my own eye.

77
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:19,149
- I'd like to cross-examine.
- I'll allow it.

78
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:22,313
- We've met before, have we not?
- Yes.

79
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:25,836
On that occasion,
you had sex with someone?

80
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:30,790
- May I remind you, you're under oath.
- Yes.

81
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:35,790
Please point out the person
you had sex with.

82
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:42,796
- And his name is?
- Zapp Brannigan.

83
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,913
The same man who didn't blow up
DOOP headquarters.

84
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:49,958
I rest my case.

85
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:54,199
Jury members, you may begin
your deliberations.

86
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:08,518
Your Honor, we have reached a verdict.

87
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:11,991
We find the defendant guilty.

88
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:17,630
You are hereby stripped
of your rank...

89
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:20,394
...and dismissed from the DOOP.

90
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:36,038
I'd like to make one final statement.

91
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,800
Kif, come and hold up the flag.

92
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,956
Wave it a little, for God's sake.

93
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:45,994
You can take away a man's title
and his uniform.

94
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:49,636
But you can't take away
his integrity and honor.

95
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:52,633
- Plus, it was Kif's fault.
- What?

96
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:55,599
You too are stripped of your rank...

97
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:58,593
...and dishonorably discharged.

98
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,837
One day a man has everything.

99
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:10,630
Then he blows up a $400 billion
space station.

100
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:13,798
Next he has nothing. Makes you think.

101
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,592
- No, it doesn't.
- Come, Kif.

102
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:21,079
It's time to begin our life as
civilians. That's an order, soldier!

103
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,591
- Hey, Bender?
- Yeah?

104
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:13,836
This is the third hose fight
I've broken up.

105
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,230
And the second one with real hoses.

106
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:20,673
Move your asses and scrub
the ship like I ordered!

107
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:26,079
- You don't have to get so mad.
- Fry wiped off some of the dirt.

108
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:35,437
- Zapp?
- I didn't know where else to turn.

109
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:38,638
- You're the only one who loved me.
- I never loved you.

110
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,831
- Physically.
- What is it?

111
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:46,239
Let me work for food. I'll paint,
or service you sexually, or mop up.

112
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:50,832
- You can't do any of those things.
- Kif might.

113
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:56,069
- Who are you talking to?
- Just a hobo who's hit rock bottom...

114
00:09:56,280 --> 00:10:00,432
...and his commander.
- You're that disgraced captain.

115
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:05,800
He'll distract people from our
awful safety record. Come in!

116
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:10,870
I want everyone to meet our new
employees. Which ones are new?

117
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:16,319
- The green dude and the fat man.
- I haven't seen that robot before.

118
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:19,628
I'm Bender. You know,
the lovable rascal.

119
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:24,591
Oh, yes. My good friend, of course.

120
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:28,597
Whoever you all are, I have good news.

121
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:33,635
You have a delivery to Stumbos Four.
The gravity is so high...

122
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:37,396
...you might be crushed
by your own hair.

123
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,794
Enjoy!

124
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:47,235
So this Leela.
I know she's a very sensuous woman.

125
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:50,119
- How is she as a captain?
- Really strict.

126
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:52,316
- And mean.
- I see.

127
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:57,196
- Does she spank the crew?
- No, she just makes us work.

128
00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:02,394
Good. But should she ever institute
some sort of spanking policy...

129
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:06,275
...I'll go for you. I won't have
my comrades harmed.

130
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,391
Hey, this guy's all right!

131
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:14,233
Here's to us poor schmoes working
for the man.

132
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:18,189
Even if he is a hot, sexy, female man.

133
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:27,829
- I computed our landing coordinates.
- Thanks. Very nice work.

134
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:31,277
- Wait, what?
- I said, "Very nice work. "

135
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:35,589
This is the happiest day of my life.

136
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:45,195
Okay, crew. You have to deliver
these 40 pillows to the hotel.

137
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,238
Not heavy, but I'm still complaining.

138
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,199
That's because we have
an anti-grav pump.

139
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:54,915
Once you're out there,
gravity will be very intense.

140
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:58,590
Hey, no prob.
This lead apron will protect me.

141
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,393
No screw-ups.

142
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:04,798
Use the hover dolly and deliver
one pillow at a time.

143
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:09,513
- Let's deliver them all at once!
- Yeah!

144
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:11,631
That's using your noodle.

145
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:24,195
Come on, girdle. Hold...

146
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,792
What the hell happened?

147
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:36,709
Some breaking, involving the dolly.
That's all we know.

148
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:39,633
I told you idiots
not to overload it.

149
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:44,590
- Each pillow weighs 150 Ibs. Here.
- Don't get your panties in a knot.

150
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:47,718
- We'll use the backup.
- I'll load pillows.

151
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:50,235
No way. You disobeyed an order...

152
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:54,035
...so now you have to hand-deliver
all 40 pillows.

153
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,231
I have a serious question.

154
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:59,392
Does the company that
made your bra do girdles?

155
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:02,200
- I ask because a friend...
- Just get to work!

156
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:08,911
- I'm Leela. Get to work.
- I agree.

157
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:13,073
The point is, it's just so
humiliating working for him.

158
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:16,512
Once he actually ordered me to...

159
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:20,992
...shave his armpits while
he was in the tub. So I...

160
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:25,119
Why don't we talk about
something besides Zapp?

161
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,316
Oh, all right.

162
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:31,313
Well, how about them, um...

163
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:34,996
Okay, well, there he was
in the tub, right?

164
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:45,794
Some good old high-gravity rain.
That'll cool us off.

165
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:53,038
This is Leela's fault.

166
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:58,195
If she let us use the backup,
we'd have broken it and given up.

167
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:01,392
A good captain needs many skills...

168
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:05,110
...like boldness, daring,
and a velour uniform.

169
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:08,397
I'm not convinced
she has any of those.

170
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:12,599
Leela's not too bad.
She just makes us work so much.

171
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:16,634
When I was captain,
I only wanted my men's Ioyalty.

172
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:19,838
If I had that,
I didn't care if they...

173
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:22,196
...drank beer in their underwear.

174
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,795
- Beer?
- Underwear?

175
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:30,598
But now, Zapp's not
captain anymore. I'm free!

176
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:33,673
Hear that? I'm actually laughing.

177
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:35,313
This is a mutiny!

178
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:39,919
You're out of here, lady.
Zapp's the new captain.

179
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:44,597
All hail the new captain!

180
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:53,119
You're a capable doer of the nasty...

181
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:57,433
...but I'm taking over.
- On what grounds, you oaf?

182
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:01,275
Failure to prevent a mutiny.
Throw her in the brig.

183
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:03,994
- What brig?
- Then the laundry room...

184
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:06,760
...which will hereafter
be called the "brig. "

185
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:12,511
- You don't want me as captain?
- Right, genius.

186
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:16,355
- Didn't I do well?
- You were mean. You yelled.

187
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:20,758
- You made us work.
- A captain needs to do that.

188
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:24,118
- I thought we were friends.
- Well...

189
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:28,439
...you shouldn't have been so mean.
- Don't worry.

190
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:32,593
Soon we'll be able to look back
on this and laugh.

191
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:40,909
Back in uniform. It nearly
still fits...

192
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:43,390
...despite the fattening hobo diet.

193
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:48,236
- What do I do with these clothes?
- Put them in the laundry brig.

194
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:52,275
- Do I have your Ioyalty?
- To the ends of the universe.

195
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:55,631
- Ten hundred percent.
- That's not enough.

196
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:59,759
You're to sit and drink
until you're as Ioyal as Kif.

197
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:03,716
- Yes, sir, sir!
- May I have a beer, sir?

198
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:07,669
No. You're Ioyal enough.
Meanwhile, I have a plan.

199
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:11,834
We'll attack our archenemy,
the Neutral Planet.

200
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:15,311
- Oh, jeez.
- Once the threat is gone...

201
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:19,399
...I'll be a hero and the DOOP
will reinstate me.

202
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:24,077
- Sir, that plan makes no sense.
- Maybe not to you.

203
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:27,829
But you were court-martialed
in disgrace.

204
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:31,072
- Burn!
- Nailed you, buddy!

205
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:38,557
Prepare for the fight between
good and Neutral.

206
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:41,638
Awesome! We'll be like,
pow-pow-pow!

207
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:44,917
And they'll be like...

208
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:49,039
...and we'll have pancakes
to celebrate. And I'll be like...

209
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:53,592
Precisely. Now, in the name of all
that is honorable...

210
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:57,395
...we'll call them with a message
of peace, then fire.

211
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:59,870
Yes, sir.

212
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:02,755
Fly the white flag of war.

213
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:12,514
<i>This is Zapp Brannigan, of the ship...</i>
<i>Planet Express Ship.</i>

214
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:16,799
<i>- I come in peace.</i>
- Can we trust him, Your Neutralness?

215
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:20,999
All I know is my gut says maybe.

216
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:25,396
- What now?
- We crash into the headquarters...

217
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:29,832
...killing them in a firestorm
from which nothing can escape.

218
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:33,038
- And then?
- Then your mission is complete.

219
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:38,195
I'll already have ejected
wearing the only space suit.

220
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:46,799
- Wait. Is this gonna kill us?
- Yes. That's what I meant by Ioyalty.

221
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,036
Now help me into the only suit.

222
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:52,556
It's sweaty.
You may need baby powder.

223
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:59,959
- We want you back as captain.
- Let me guess. He canceled naptime?

224
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:04,279
He ran out of beer?
So he's about to kill us?

225
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:08,789
- We want Leela to be captain.
- Mutiny?

226
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:12,350
Never thought I'd see the day.
Come, Kif.

227
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:17,759
- There's a child's suit for you.
- I want to stay here with Leela.

228
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:21,197
She actually listens
to what I have to...

229
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:36,992
He's disabled the steering!
We're gonna crash!

230
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:40,596
Leela, save me! And yourself, I guess.

231
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:42,791
And my banjo!

232
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:44,794
And Fry.

233
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:47,793
Okay. We have one chance.

234
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,639
- Will you do what I say?
- Absolutely.

235
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:54,435
- Even if I make you work?
- As your God is my witness.

236
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:59,395
Get the backup dolly and put all dark
matter into the left engine.

237
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:01,596
Aw, man! That crap's heavy!

238
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,751
- And warm.
- Just do it!

239
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:09,355
Your Neutralness, beige alert.

240
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:12,916
If I die, tell my wife, "Hello. "

241
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:17,040
I don't want to die at age 25.

242
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:21,239
<i>Unless we hit a time warp,</i>
<i>don 't worry about it.</i>

243
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,994
- It's too low!
- <i>Q</i>uick!

244
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,230
You did it! You actually did it!

245
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:43,189
And no one will be punished
for the mutiny!

246
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:52,197
When Leela panicked,
maybe because of female troubles...

247
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:55,437
...my quick mind saved the day.

248
00:19:55,720 --> 00:20:00,635
- Is this tale of magic and glory true?
- Well, actually...

249
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:04,873
Good. If they don't take him
back, we'll keep him.

250
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,788
It's true. My female incompetence,
his cat-like reflexes...

251
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:13,998
...the stuff that made no sense,
all of it.

252
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:16,638
In that case, Zapp Brannigan...

253
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:21,396
...I hereby restore your rank
and parking privileges.

254
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:27,994
Come, Kif. We've got work to do.

255
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:33,599
I'll call and tell you about it.

256
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:40,633
Leela, even though you're mean...

257
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:45,072
...you're the best captain ever.
- Yeah. You're one dynamite lady.

258
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:47,396
- Can we have a week off?
- No.

259
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:50,433
- Please?
- Come on, captain.

260
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:54,235
- Oh, all right.
- No time off.

261
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:57,119
- Oh, man.
- Let's mutiny.
