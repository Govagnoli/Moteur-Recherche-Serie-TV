1
00:00:07,213 --> 00:00:09,329
The Day the Earth Stood Stupid

2
00:01:03,053 --> 00:01:08,002
- Is Nibbler stoked for the show?
- He ought to be, with all the training.

3
00:01:08,213 --> 00:01:13,162
Nibbler, roll over and you get a ham.
Roll over. Roll over for the ham.

4
00:01:16,213 --> 00:01:20,001
You are so adorable. Who wants a ham?

5
00:01:22,093 --> 00:01:23,242
Zooka barooka!

6
00:01:23,493 --> 00:01:27,611
First prize is $500
and a year's supply of dog food!

7
00:01:27,813 --> 00:01:32,807
- Five hundred dollars, you say?
- Dog food, you say?

8
00:01:36,773 --> 00:01:40,243
That dog's gonna be hard to beat.
Look at him.

9
00:01:40,493 --> 00:01:42,404
One sheep, two sheep...

10
00:01:43,293 --> 00:01:44,806
...three sheep.

11
00:01:46,053 --> 00:01:49,648
But our real competition
is the Hypno-Toad.

12
00:02:07,973 --> 00:02:10,646
Your turn, Nibbler.
Herd those sheep!

13
00:02:13,773 --> 00:02:15,604
Come on, Nibbler!

14
00:02:22,293 --> 00:02:27,606
I have a late entry. My hard-shelled
whooping terrier, Mr. Zoidberg.

15
00:02:33,853 --> 00:02:35,809
Faster! Faster!

16
00:02:43,813 --> 00:02:46,407
Suck in that gut!
You wanna be spayed?

17
00:02:50,493 --> 00:02:53,565
Silence, you cur!
Puff out that brisket!

18
00:02:59,853 --> 00:03:02,731
I should be weeping! I'm not weeping!

19
00:03:10,613 --> 00:03:12,604
I love these things.

20
00:03:15,253 --> 00:03:17,847
Shake paws, Nibbler. Come on, shake.

21
00:03:18,093 --> 00:03:23,406
He might be a little hungry. Usually,
he's had more ham by now. Shake!

22
00:03:50,853 --> 00:03:55,404
Third prize, a party-sized keg
of guinea pigs, goes to...

23
00:03:55,613 --> 00:03:58,889
...Dave Spiegel
and his owner, Fluffers.

24
00:04:00,893 --> 00:04:06,286
Second prize, this lovely afghan,
made from an Afghan, goes to...

25
00:04:06,493 --> 00:04:09,246
...Bender and his whooping terrier!

26
00:04:09,493 --> 00:04:15,204
Second place? That's a fancy word for
losing! You didn't stick your landing!

27
00:04:15,413 --> 00:04:18,166
- Forgive me, my friend.
- Never!

28
00:04:18,373 --> 00:04:23,163
And before we announce the winner,
we have a special award for...

29
00:04:23,373 --> 00:04:26,729
...Ms. Leela and her
mystery pet, Nibbler!

30
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:28,844
Me? Award?

31
00:04:29,093 --> 00:04:30,811
Him? Me? Good?

32
00:04:31,053 --> 00:04:34,602
That's the eloquence you'd
expect from the owner of...

33
00:04:34,813 --> 00:04:36,849
...Dumbest Pet in Show!

34
00:04:41,013 --> 00:04:43,573
And the grand prize winner:

35
00:04:43,733 --> 00:04:46,611
The Hypno-Toad!

36
00:04:49,213 --> 00:04:52,489
All glory to the Hypno-Toad!

37
00:04:56,173 --> 00:04:59,324
Ah, maybe they're right.
Maybe Nibbler is dumb.

38
00:04:59,573 --> 00:05:03,725
Don't listen to them. People said
I was dumb, but I proved them.

39
00:05:03,933 --> 00:05:08,802
Good news. We were supposed to make
a delivery to the planet Tweenis 1 2.

40
00:05:08,973 --> 00:05:11,248
But it's been completely destroyed.

41
00:05:11,453 --> 00:05:14,684
- Why is that good news?
- They paid in advance.

42
00:05:14,893 --> 00:05:17,327
- Excuse me.
- This is mighty strange.

43
00:05:18,333 --> 00:05:20,801
First, Space Rome collapsed.

44
00:05:21,013 --> 00:05:25,006
Then, Don Martin 3 went caflooie.
And now Tweenis 1 2.

45
00:05:25,213 --> 00:05:27,886
- This planet is next.
- That's Earth.

46
00:05:29,053 --> 00:05:32,523
- The planet we live on?
- I'd hate to be those guys.

47
00:05:39,173 --> 00:05:43,724
What's got into him? He's twitching
like Zoidberg when you say "food."

48
00:05:43,933 --> 00:05:44,968
What, now?

49
00:05:46,693 --> 00:05:49,161
No! Nibbler, come back!

50
00:05:52,573 --> 00:05:58,250
Too bad Nibbler's not around.
I'll have to eat this raw ham myself.

51
00:06:02,893 --> 00:06:03,882
Nibbler?

52
00:06:04,773 --> 00:06:07,162
Nibbler, you're scaring me.

53
00:06:16,133 --> 00:06:17,691
Nibbler?!

54
00:06:25,613 --> 00:06:26,807
Am I going crazy?

55
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:30,125
Have my years of hedonism
caught up with me?

56
00:06:39,253 --> 00:06:41,972
Nibbler, help! Don't leave me here!

57
00:06:58,253 --> 00:07:02,292
Nibbler? Could you scooch
the seat up, just a little bit?

58
00:07:17,413 --> 00:07:20,530
- Leela back yet?
- Help me! My heart stopped!

59
00:07:20,773 --> 00:07:25,801
- You don't have one. You're a robot.
- Sure. Right. Robot.

60
00:07:26,013 --> 00:07:28,732
Oh, Fry! My skin's all dry and clanky.

61
00:07:28,973 --> 00:07:32,966
- Well, yeah. Robots are made of metal.
- Am I a robot?

62
00:07:33,133 --> 00:07:37,126
I don't get this scam.
You already have my power of attorney.

63
00:07:37,733 --> 00:07:39,451
Fry!

64
00:07:40,413 --> 00:07:41,482
My skin!

65
00:07:43,813 --> 00:07:45,371
I'm a genius!

66
00:07:48,493 --> 00:07:51,007
Why is everyone acting so weird?

67
00:07:51,213 --> 00:07:53,886
Zoidbee want balloon!
Want balloon now!

68
00:07:54,093 --> 00:07:56,004
Zoidbee want go outside!

69
00:07:56,213 --> 00:07:58,124
Oh, I just let you back in!

70
00:08:00,013 --> 00:08:03,528
Unbelievable! I thought you were
a furry little moron.

71
00:08:03,693 --> 00:08:08,813
But here you are flying an adorable
spaceship! If only you could talk.

72
00:08:09,613 --> 00:08:12,207
Wait! I understood that!

73
00:08:14,293 --> 00:08:18,206
You're transmitting your thoughts
directly to my brain?

74
00:08:19,493 --> 00:08:24,408
You say those awful flying brains
are making everyone on Earth stupid?

75
00:08:25,613 --> 00:08:27,604
Oh, stupider.

76
00:08:27,813 --> 00:08:30,930
And you say we're headed
for your home planet...

77
00:08:31,173 --> 00:08:34,483
...where you've lived since
the beginning of the universe?

78
00:08:34,693 --> 00:08:37,366
So, how did the universe begin?

79
00:08:43,653 --> 00:08:45,803
Then the meaning of existence...?

80
00:08:45,973 --> 00:08:47,804
So every religion is wrong.

81
00:09:06,813 --> 00:09:08,644
<i>You fell! Hi!</i>

82
00:09:08,813 --> 00:09:11,771
<i>Some bad things happened.
One bad thing was...</i>

83
00:09:11,933 --> 00:09:14,731
<i>... a train got crashed. Wanna see?</i>

84
00:09:14,933 --> 00:09:18,130
<i>People won 't be late, though.
The governor said:</i>

85
00:09:18,293 --> 00:09:21,205
<i>"I'm sending in more trains."</i>

86
00:09:23,213 --> 00:09:24,612
<i>- Go!
- Wait for me!</i>

87
00:09:24,813 --> 00:09:27,247
<i>Morbo can 't understand
his Teleprompter.</i>

88
00:09:27,493 --> 00:09:30,849
<i>How do you say the letter that
looks like a man with a hat?</i>

89
00:09:31,093 --> 00:09:33,004
<i>It's a T. It goes:</i>

90
00:09:33,213 --> 00:09:36,091
<i>Hello, little man. I will destroy you!</i>

91
00:09:36,333 --> 00:09:40,008
Even the news monster
is acting strange. What to do?

92
00:09:40,213 --> 00:09:42,807
I know! Let's play the lottery!

93
00:09:43,053 --> 00:09:44,645
Let's buy Internet stock!

94
00:09:44,893 --> 00:09:47,930
On margin! Zoidbee wanna buy
on margin!

95
00:09:48,133 --> 00:09:50,283
Look at me! I'm invisible!

96
00:09:50,493 --> 00:09:54,122
I know what's going on!
You've all become idiots!

97
00:09:54,373 --> 00:09:58,889
- Hey! Let's all join the Reform Party!
- Oh, yeah!

98
00:10:13,293 --> 00:10:17,923
Welcome back, ambassador to Earth,
homeworld of the pizza bagel.

99
00:10:18,133 --> 00:10:20,886
I bear many receipts
for reimbursement.

100
00:10:21,093 --> 00:10:23,732
The four welcomes to you as well, Leela.

101
00:10:23,973 --> 00:10:27,249
We shall appear to be
speaking your language.

102
00:10:27,493 --> 00:10:30,451
- Do not be afraid, child.
- I'm not afraid.

103
00:10:30,693 --> 00:10:32,172
Uh, good. Good.

104
00:10:32,373 --> 00:10:35,604
So, your real name is Lord Nibbler?

105
00:10:35,813 --> 00:10:37,405
It is for your sake.

106
00:10:37,613 --> 00:10:40,844
By the time you pronounce
one letter of my name...

107
00:10:41,013 --> 00:10:45,052
...a trillion cosmoses would sink
into eternal night.

108
00:10:45,253 --> 00:10:47,130
Oh, you're all so cute.

109
00:10:47,333 --> 00:10:50,564
No, we are an ancient, powerful race.

110
00:10:50,773 --> 00:10:55,005
Behold. When the universe
was forged in the big bang...

111
00:10:55,253 --> 00:10:58,370
...our mighty race was
already 1 7 years old.

112
00:11:01,213 --> 00:11:04,250
For the first millisecond,
things were okay.

113
00:11:04,493 --> 00:11:08,372
But there arose a terrible enemy,
the Brain Spawn.

114
00:11:11,493 --> 00:11:16,203
Ever since, we have waged
unceasing war against these dreadful...

115
00:11:16,453 --> 00:11:17,442
Lunch is ready.

116
00:11:17,613 --> 00:11:20,525
Then let the feast of 1 000 hams begin!

117
00:11:24,733 --> 00:11:28,009
Why are these Brain Spawn
attacking Earth?

118
00:11:28,253 --> 00:11:30,721
They hate all consciousness.

119
00:11:30,933 --> 00:11:35,563
Thoughts screech at them like
the forced laughs of movie patrons.

120
00:11:35,773 --> 00:11:37,252
Thus, they travel...

121
00:11:37,493 --> 00:11:41,645
...making everyone stupid in order
to wipe out all thought.

122
00:11:41,893 --> 00:11:45,806
Wipe out thought? My God!
They're flying televisions!

123
00:11:46,013 --> 00:11:50,803
And even we are powerless
to stop them, fearsome though we are.

124
00:11:52,333 --> 00:11:54,563
There is one being
who can resist.

125
00:11:54,733 --> 00:12:00,046
A child of destiny whose bizarre brain
waves make him immune to their attack.

126
00:12:00,293 --> 00:12:03,205
He is the hope of the universe.

127
00:12:04,413 --> 00:12:09,771
The fate of your world, perhaps all
worlds, rests in his special mind.

128
00:12:09,973 --> 00:12:12,248
Now, when you say "special"...

129
00:12:18,693 --> 00:12:21,048
Attention New New Yorkers!

130
00:12:21,293 --> 00:12:25,206
Stop acting so stupid!

131
00:12:35,293 --> 00:12:39,764
<i>Fleet holding at perimeter of Moron
Zone, formerly known as Earth.</i>

132
00:12:39,973 --> 00:12:43,602
Why would Fry be immune?
Because he doesn't shower?

133
00:12:43,813 --> 00:12:47,806
They suppress intelligence
by attacking delta brain waves.

134
00:12:48,013 --> 00:12:52,643
Every animal and robot generates
this wave, as do certain trees.

135
00:12:52,893 --> 00:12:55,930
Fry, however, does not.

136
00:12:56,573 --> 00:13:01,249
Somehow, he has cobbled random
brain waves into a working mind.

137
00:13:01,453 --> 00:13:05,241
- Like a carpet-remnant prom dress.
- Like your prom dress.

138
00:13:05,493 --> 00:13:10,647
The Brain Spawn are commanded by a
brain with a gooey center of pure hate.

139
00:13:10,853 --> 00:13:15,005
Only Fry, with his superior,
yet inferior mind, can approach it.

140
00:13:15,173 --> 00:13:18,006
Tell him to disable it.
We will do the rest.

141
00:13:18,213 --> 00:13:20,249
- You can count on me.
- No.

142
00:13:20,493 --> 00:13:25,806
- On Earth, you will be too stupid.
- That's why we wrote it down for you.

143
00:13:27,253 --> 00:13:30,051
We also prepared
a bag lunch and mittens.

144
00:13:31,813 --> 00:13:35,692
Time to reeducate you dunces.
We'll start with presidents.

145
00:13:35,893 --> 00:13:39,806
This was our first president,
George Washington.

146
00:13:41,733 --> 00:13:45,772
Let's review.
Who was our first president?

147
00:13:46,893 --> 00:13:50,090
- A pickle jar?
- Thomas Jefferson?

148
00:13:53,613 --> 00:13:56,685
Leela! I've been so worried!
Are you a bonehead?

149
00:13:56,893 --> 00:13:59,726
I... have to tell...

150
00:13:59,973 --> 00:14:04,489
...must... important... something...

151
00:14:04,693 --> 00:14:06,684
You're going a mile a minute.

152
00:14:06,893 --> 00:14:09,123
This... you for this!

153
00:14:09,333 --> 00:14:10,607
Thanks!

154
00:14:11,493 --> 00:14:12,892
No!

155
00:14:15,253 --> 00:14:18,450
- Fire hot!
- The professie will help.

156
00:14:19,693 --> 00:14:21,092
Fire indeed hot.

157
00:14:25,453 --> 00:14:28,172
Oh, Chester A. Arthur fall down.

158
00:14:28,373 --> 00:14:30,648
Brain. Brain make people dumb.

159
00:14:30,853 --> 00:14:34,607
No, Leela. Brain make people smart.

160
00:14:40,653 --> 00:14:44,407
- You go fight biggest brain.
- Even bigger than those?

161
00:14:44,653 --> 00:14:47,213
- Where is it?
- I don't know.

162
00:14:47,413 --> 00:14:50,325
A giant brain is
basically a giant nerd.

163
00:14:50,573 --> 00:14:52,848
And where would a giant nerd be?

164
00:14:54,813 --> 00:14:56,610
The library!

165
00:15:12,173 --> 00:15:13,652
Pathetic human race.

166
00:15:13,893 --> 00:15:17,772
Arranging knowledge by category
made it easier to absorb.

167
00:15:17,973 --> 00:15:23,001
Dewey, you fool, your decimal system
has played right into my hands.

168
00:15:26,693 --> 00:15:29,730
- What do you want?
- I'm here to kick your ass!

169
00:15:29,933 --> 00:15:35,007
Wishful thinking. We have long since
evolved beyond the need for asses.

170
00:15:38,693 --> 00:15:43,289
Odd. My stupefaction field
is having no effect on you.

171
00:15:43,493 --> 00:15:47,884
That's right! You'll find a little
knowledge is a dangerous thing!

172
00:15:49,413 --> 00:15:52,610
Better think of a new plan.
Come on, think.

173
00:15:52,853 --> 00:15:55,321
Thinking. Thinking...

174
00:15:56,653 --> 00:15:58,883
Oh! Stop that!

175
00:15:59,093 --> 00:16:03,769
Thinking hurts him! Maybe I can
think of a way to use that.

176
00:16:05,453 --> 00:16:09,810
Prepare to be thought at!
Leela, give me a topic.

177
00:16:10,013 --> 00:16:11,810
I can't think of anything.

178
00:16:15,133 --> 00:16:18,409
<i>Gotta find something.
Hardy Boys? Too easy.</i>

179
00:16:18,653 --> 00:16:20,405
<i>Nancy Drew? Too hard.</i>

180
00:16:20,613 --> 00:16:23,605
<i>Perfect! Bonfire of the Vanities!</i>

181
00:16:23,853 --> 00:16:26,492
No! It's unbearable!

182
00:16:30,093 --> 00:16:33,529
They're weakening.
Nibblonians to Nibble stations.

183
00:16:33,773 --> 00:16:36,571
Prepare Cuddle Bug for deployment.

184
00:16:36,733 --> 00:16:40,567
- Sometimes I fear we are cute.
- Oh, niggle-snooch.

185
00:16:41,453 --> 00:16:45,571
Take that! This one I don't
understand. But take this one!

186
00:16:46,813 --> 00:16:48,451
You have not won yet.

187
00:16:48,693 --> 00:16:52,083
Each book is a gateway
to a mental realm...

188
00:16:52,293 --> 00:16:56,411
...and I shall take you there
and imprison you forever!

189
00:16:57,453 --> 00:16:58,568
Icky!

190
00:17:05,213 --> 00:17:06,441
Where are we?

191
00:17:06,773 --> 00:17:10,812
A gold doubloon to the man
who first spies the white whale.

192
00:17:12,173 --> 00:17:15,404
- Big whale over there.
- I saw it first.

193
00:17:17,053 --> 00:17:20,284
Wait! That no white whale!
It gray thinkie whale!

194
00:17:20,493 --> 00:17:22,723
Let go of me! I have to kill it!

195
00:17:22,933 --> 00:17:29,406
Farewell! You will all be trapped in
this dense symbolist tome forever!

196
00:17:30,493 --> 00:17:33,007
Follow him! It's our only way out!

197
00:17:40,373 --> 00:17:42,568
Have you seen a giant brain?

198
00:17:42,813 --> 00:17:45,646
Yep. I let him help with the fence.

199
00:17:45,893 --> 00:17:50,842
Tom Sawyer, you tricked me. This is
less fun than previously indicated.

200
00:17:51,093 --> 00:17:55,769
Let this corny slice of Americana
be your tomb for all eternity.

201
00:17:55,973 --> 00:17:57,201
- No!
- Come on!

202
00:18:05,813 --> 00:18:08,805
Mr. Fry? Mama says
you're quite the oddity.

203
00:18:09,013 --> 00:18:12,722
- A bachelor at your age.
- I'm an oddity? Wait till...

204
00:18:12,933 --> 00:18:17,643
The most eligible landowner
in all Hartfordshire, Mr. Brainley.

205
00:18:17,893 --> 00:18:19,770
I'm a gigantic brain!

206
00:18:19,973 --> 00:18:22,328
- I say!
- Most ungentlemanlike.

207
00:18:22,533 --> 00:18:25,525
What news have you
of the London season?

208
00:18:25,773 --> 00:18:27,729
- Well...
- Hey, think fast!

209
00:18:27,973 --> 00:18:30,248
I always think fast.

210
00:18:30,493 --> 00:18:33,132
The whale! He be white now!

211
00:18:40,053 --> 00:18:41,327
I've got an idea.

212
00:18:41,573 --> 00:18:43,404
Stay here with Queequeg.

213
00:18:45,493 --> 00:18:47,927
Is there a Mrs. Queequeg?

214
00:18:52,493 --> 00:18:55,087
Yes! I'm free!

215
00:18:56,293 --> 00:19:00,809
All right, brain! Get ready for
some electroshock treatment!

216
00:19:15,853 --> 00:19:18,447
Fry, don't die! Wake up!

217
00:19:20,613 --> 00:19:22,604
No!

218
00:19:28,493 --> 00:19:32,327
"Leela cried as Fry lay dead
under the heavy bookcase.

219
00:19:32,533 --> 00:19:35,286
The Big Brain laughed in triumph.

220
00:19:35,453 --> 00:19:39,890
Then, for no reason, he left Earth
forever. The End. " There!

221
00:19:40,133 --> 00:19:44,888
Now he's trapped in my book,
full of plot holes and spelling errors.

222
00:19:45,093 --> 00:19:50,611
The Big Brain am winning again!
I am the "greetest"!

223
00:19:51,493 --> 00:19:56,408
Now I am leaving Earth for no "raisin"!

224
00:20:00,693 --> 00:20:04,891
The Big Brain is defeated.
Let what must be done, be done.

225
00:20:11,573 --> 00:20:17,443
Me... feel... a bit better
in cognitive faculties.

226
00:20:17,613 --> 00:20:18,648
I did it!

227
00:20:18,853 --> 00:20:23,005
And it's all thanks to the books
at my local library.

228
00:20:24,253 --> 00:20:26,642
<i>And so, life returned to normal.</i>

229
00:20:26,893 --> 00:20:31,603
<i>Or as normal as it gets on this
dirtball inhabited by psychotic apes.</i>

230
00:20:31,813 --> 00:20:36,807
<i>The people of Earth had no memory
of what had transpired.</i>

231
00:20:37,053 --> 00:20:41,763
<i>Except Fry. And no one believed him
or cared what he had to say.</i>

232
00:20:43,053 --> 00:20:48,810
<i>I returned to my post, ever-vigilant,
lest Earth again come under attack.</i>

233
00:20:49,013 --> 00:20:54,610
<i>And when that day comes,
God help us. God help us all.</i>

234
00:20:54,813 --> 00:20:57,008
Time for a diapie change.

235
00:20:57,653 --> 00:20:59,245
<i>End transmission.</i>
