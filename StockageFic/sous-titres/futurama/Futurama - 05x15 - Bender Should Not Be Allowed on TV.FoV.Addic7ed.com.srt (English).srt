00:00:07,533 --> 00:00:09,046
Futurama [5x15] - Bender Should Not Be Allowed On TV - CiWaN

2
00:00:09,213 --> 00:00:10,202
Oh, my.

3
00:00:10,373 --> 00:00:15,322
Here we go, y'all!
Zoidberg, Zoidberg. Zoidberg.

4
00:00:18,893 --> 00:00:22,488
This is a story about all my friends.

5
00:00:22,653 --> 00:00:25,884
Goodbye. Goodbye.

6
00:00:29,693 --> 00:00:33,322
Previously on All My Circuits:

7
00:00:33,693 --> 00:00:38,608
I'm sorry, Father. But somewhere along
the way, I forgot how to be your son.

8
00:00:38,773 --> 00:00:43,893
Why, Antonio?
Because I have amnesia!

9
00:00:47,693 --> 00:00:51,732
Calculon! But I thought you were--
Egyptian?

10
00:00:51,893 --> 00:00:54,726
Before I kill you,
I must ask you one question:

11
00:00:54,893 --> 00:00:55,882
Who am l?

12
00:00:56,053 --> 00:00:59,523
For I have Amnesia!

13
00:00:59,693 --> 00:01:04,323
Let me get this straight.
Does anyone here not have amnesia?

14
00:01:04,573 --> 00:01:07,929
Not sure.
I don't know.

15
00:01:08,093 --> 00:01:12,848
This show is awesome! When I grow
up, I'm gonna have so much amnesia.

16
00:01:13,013 --> 00:01:15,846
Me too! I mean, I have it now.
But I forgot.

17
00:01:16,013 --> 00:01:20,325
Well, mine's louder!
Cram a ham in it, you twerps!

18
00:01:20,493 --> 00:01:22,927
Sorry.
I had it coming.

19
00:01:24,893 --> 00:01:28,932
Welcome, swingers!
Pull up a groove and get fabulous!

20
00:01:29,093 --> 00:01:32,881
Nude rock bands, big piles of
what I assume is talcum powder.

21
00:01:33,053 --> 00:01:35,203
It's quite a birthday party, Calculon.

22
00:01:35,373 --> 00:01:39,082
Cool! I'm gonna have a fabulatious
birthday party just like Calculon!

23
00:01:39,253 --> 00:01:43,007
Oh, yeah? Well, I'm gonna show
up looking good just like Monique.

24
00:01:43,173 --> 00:01:46,006
Do you two have to imitate
everything you see on TV?

25
00:01:46,213 --> 00:01:48,807
We're 12. So, yes.

26
00:01:48,973 --> 00:01:51,203
Hold up, Cubert.
You're a clone of the professor.

27
00:01:51,373 --> 00:01:53,329
Do clones even have birthdays?

28
00:01:53,493 --> 00:01:55,085
Duh.

29
00:01:55,493 --> 00:01:57,768
Duh what?

30
00:02:02,493 --> 00:02:04,688
Dad? Do I have a birthday?

31
00:02:04,893 --> 00:02:08,727
Hmm. You didn't have a birth,
so technically, no.

32
00:02:09,013 --> 00:02:12,050
Hmm.
Oh, don't feel bad.

33
00:02:12,213 --> 00:02:15,683
We can celebrate the day I
extracted you from the cloning tank.

34
00:02:15,853 --> 00:02:20,005
Or the day I scraped your DNA
from that growth on my back.

35
00:02:20,173 --> 00:02:22,050
That one!
Yes.

36
00:02:22,213 --> 00:02:27,333
It was 13 years ago next week.
I used this very fork.

37
00:02:27,493 --> 00:02:29,848
Oh, well, isn't that--

38
00:02:30,013 --> 00:02:32,402
Hey. Next week'll be my birthday too!

39
00:02:32,573 --> 00:02:35,963
That's true! Lf only there were a way
to have one party for both of you...

40
00:02:36,133 --> 00:02:39,091
Here at the office, then write
it off as a business expense.

41
00:02:39,253 --> 00:02:41,847
Wait! I thought of a way!
The way I just said!

42
00:02:42,013 --> 00:02:43,969
Yeah!
Way to go, Pops!

43
00:02:44,133 --> 00:02:46,852
Something's happening on television!

44
00:02:49,253 --> 00:02:55,203
Oh, Monique. Why did we wait so
many years to bathe in champagne?

45
00:03:02,573 --> 00:03:05,041
Father! I've discovered
the shocking secret...

46
00:03:05,213 --> 00:03:07,443
Mother has kept from you for 200 years!

47
00:03:07,613 --> 00:03:09,046
No! No!

48
00:03:09,213 --> 00:03:11,681
Brace yourself, for when
I speak these words...

49
00:03:11,853 --> 00:03:15,528
You may well suffer an
attack of explosive amnesia!

50
00:03:15,693 --> 00:03:20,562
For you see, the horrible secret is--

51
00:03:26,213 --> 00:03:29,285
Whoever's directing this
is a master of suspense!

52
00:03:35,853 --> 00:03:40,404
He's busteds.
Let's get hims out of heres.

53
00:03:43,293 --> 00:03:46,091
We now join America 's most
popular show in progress:

54
00:03:47,413 --> 00:03:50,962
Everybody Loves Hypno-Toad!

55
00:03:54,293 --> 00:03:57,012
This show's been going
downhill since season three.

56
00:04:03,053 --> 00:04:07,365
Look who's here, everyone!
It's Zoidberg, the lovable tramp!

57
00:04:08,573 --> 00:04:11,212
Since when are you performing
at children's parties?

58
00:04:11,373 --> 00:04:17,448
Performing? What? Please, if someone
could spare me money to buy shoes?

59
00:04:17,613 --> 00:04:18,887
This party pukes.
Yeah!

60
00:04:19,053 --> 00:04:21,726
The guests were supposed
to be here three hours ago.

61
00:04:21,893 --> 00:04:26,205
Well, that doesn't mean that no one is
coming or that you two are total losers.

62
00:04:26,373 --> 00:04:27,408
Who gave you that idea?

63
00:04:28,733 --> 00:04:31,042
All right! They must've
all come as a group!

64
00:04:31,213 --> 00:04:37,209
Welcome, swingers!
Pull up a groove and get fabulous!

65
00:04:38,933 --> 00:04:40,161
Huh?

66
00:04:40,333 --> 00:04:44,042
Good day, fellows. Someone dumped
this invitation in my begging cup.

67
00:04:44,213 --> 00:04:46,329
Happy growth-Scraping day to all!

68
00:04:48,493 --> 00:04:51,053
Fire them all.

69
00:04:53,373 --> 00:04:58,572
Guys. Guys. Something's
happening on television again!

70
00:05:05,973 --> 00:05:08,965
Welcome to Entertainment
and Earth lnvasion Tonite.

71
00:05:09,133 --> 00:05:13,331
Across the galaxy my people are
completing a mighty space fleet...

72
00:05:13,493 --> 00:05:18,203
That will exterminate the human race!
But first, this news from Tinsel Town.

73
00:05:18,373 --> 00:05:21,206
Following Antonio Calculon
Jr.'s breakdown on the set...

74
00:05:21,373 --> 00:05:25,252
The popular TV show All My Circuits
will hold an open casting call...

75
00:05:25,413 --> 00:05:27,324
For child robots to replace him.

76
00:05:27,493 --> 00:05:29,848
An open casting call for child robots?

77
00:05:30,013 --> 00:05:32,083
Tinny Tim! Are you
thinking what I'm thinking?

78
00:05:32,253 --> 00:05:35,609
What's that, sir?
That I, Bender, am perfect for the role!

79
00:05:35,773 --> 00:05:40,051
You raised my hopes and dashed
them quite expertly, sir. Bravo!

80
00:05:47,853 --> 00:05:50,970
Bender, your swarthy Latin
charm will only get you so far.

81
00:05:51,133 --> 00:05:53,522
There's a lot of famous
child acting units here.

82
00:05:53,693 --> 00:05:55,604
Look, there's Macaulay Culkon!

83
00:05:56,813 --> 00:06:00,203
He's just not cute
since he got puberty installed.

84
00:06:00,373 --> 00:06:03,888
There's that robot child actor who grew
up and robbed the convenience store.

85
00:06:04,053 --> 00:06:06,123
And there's that robot
child actor who grew up...

86
00:06:06,293 --> 00:06:08,648
And became a convenience store.

87
00:06:08,813 --> 00:06:11,486
Lottery ticket, please.

88
00:06:13,213 --> 00:06:17,445
We're ready for the first audition.
"Emote-Atron Jr. "?

89
00:06:17,613 --> 00:06:21,128
Hold on, precious. Let's make
you look nice for the lady.

90
00:06:21,293 --> 00:06:23,409
What's this? What did I tell you?

91
00:06:23,573 --> 00:06:26,406
No more hanging wires!

92
00:06:26,653 --> 00:06:29,486
In this scene, you've just
found out your real father...

93
00:06:29,653 --> 00:06:34,249
Is Calculon's fourth evil identical
septuplet, Sleazy Martinez.

94
00:06:34,413 --> 00:06:36,768
Okay? Take us there!

95
00:06:37,013 --> 00:06:40,369
Now that I know the truth,
Father, I must ride south

96
00:06:40,533 --> 00:06:43,366
And join the robo-Bandidos at Veracruz!

97
00:06:43,533 --> 00:06:48,288
Boo! Boo! This kid sucks!
We want Bender! Boo!

98
00:06:48,453 --> 00:06:52,605
Well, I thought he was good, but the
audience seems to have turned on him.

99
00:06:52,773 --> 00:06:54,252
But I don't think--
Next!

100
00:06:56,213 --> 00:07:00,331
At Veracruz. So if you'll
kindly hand me my poncho--

101
00:07:00,493 --> 00:07:04,042
Boo! Bring on Bender!
Boo! Bender's the greatest!

102
00:07:04,213 --> 00:07:06,329
Sorry, kid. You're flailing up there.

103
00:07:09,893 --> 00:07:13,283
Ninety actors and they all got booed.

104
00:07:13,453 --> 00:07:16,365
I just wish we could get this
Bender I keep hearing about.

105
00:07:16,533 --> 00:07:18,205
They say he's the greatest.

106
00:07:18,373 --> 00:07:21,922
Well, there is a robot named Bender
here, but he's much too old for--

107
00:07:22,093 --> 00:07:23,526
Send him in forthwith!

108
00:07:23,693 --> 00:07:26,412
Boo! Not as good as Bender! Boo!

109
00:07:26,573 --> 00:07:27,562
Mr. Bender?

110
00:07:28,973 --> 00:07:32,488
Have you ever been on TV before?
Once, when I took those hostages.

111
00:07:32,653 --> 00:07:36,248
I saw that. You were good.
Let's hear you audition.

112
00:07:37,413 --> 00:07:39,847
"Bandidos"? Oh, this is great.

113
00:07:40,013 --> 00:07:44,723
Because I happen to have
a flawless Spanish accent.

114
00:07:44,893 --> 00:07:51,002
I will see. Adiós, Padre. Come, Jesus,
my faithful chihuahua.

115
00:07:51,173 --> 00:07:56,008
Tonight we eat guacamole by the EI Rio!

116
00:07:56,173 --> 00:07:58,971
That was so terrible I
think you gave me cancer!

117
00:07:59,133 --> 00:08:03,251
I don't care how popular you are,
you will never work on my show!

118
00:08:03,413 --> 00:08:06,291
Yay, Bender!
We demand Bender!

119
00:08:06,453 --> 00:08:10,048
However, you've got the job.
Welcome aboard, son!

120
00:08:10,213 --> 00:08:12,773
Father-O!

121
00:08:22,893 --> 00:08:25,771
I'd like you to meet our director,
whose name I never learned.

122
00:08:25,933 --> 00:08:29,562
Yo. I read the script, and I think it
would help my character's motivation

123
00:08:29,733 --> 00:08:32,645
If he was on fire.
Don't worry about the script, baby.

124
00:08:32,813 --> 00:08:35,202
We rewrote your part to
suit your acting abilities.

125
00:08:35,373 --> 00:08:38,729
So now my character
has a British accent?

126
00:08:38,893 --> 00:08:42,408
No, now your character's in a coma.
Get in bed and don't move.

127
00:08:45,413 --> 00:08:46,732
And action!

128
00:08:46,893 --> 00:08:49,726
Stupid dumb coma.
I could've been British.

129
00:08:49,893 --> 00:08:55,763
Alas that mine only son should sink
into an irreversible, permanent...

130
00:08:56,493 --> 00:08:57,608
Coma.

131
00:08:57,773 --> 00:09:01,686
Permanent? That's completely out of
character for Antonio. I'm getting up.

132
00:09:01,853 --> 00:09:04,447
Curse the tragic
wildebeest accident that--

133
00:09:04,613 --> 00:09:08,208
Hey, everyone! Antonio here,
but you can call me Bender!

134
00:09:08,373 --> 00:09:12,332
I got ants in my butt and I
needs to strut! Come on, baby!

135
00:09:15,893 --> 00:09:18,043
Come on!

136
00:09:19,093 --> 00:09:22,324
I'm not familiar with the
type of thing I'm seeing.

137
00:09:22,493 --> 00:09:25,007
Bite my shiny metal ass! Yeah!

138
00:09:25,173 --> 00:09:27,687
Come on, baby, yeah.
Come on, yeah!

139
00:09:27,853 --> 00:09:32,085
Cut! That's the worst coma acting I've
ever seen. We'll have to shoot it again.

140
00:09:32,253 --> 00:09:35,165
No. No, no, no.
I don't do two takes.

141
00:09:35,333 --> 00:09:38,643
But this guy was--
Amateurs like you do two takes.

142
00:09:38,813 --> 00:09:42,886
I do one take.
Print it. I'll be in my three-Story trailer.

143
00:09:44,173 --> 00:09:49,850
Bite my shiny metal ass! Yeah!
Come on, baby, yeah! Come on, yeah!

144
00:09:50,013 --> 00:09:52,971
Now, that's hospital dancing!
Pretty good, hey, Calcy?

145
00:09:53,133 --> 00:09:57,172
Good? I've seen better acting
from extras in Godzilla movies.

146
00:09:58,533 --> 00:10:00,046
I didn't shoot this.

147
00:10:00,213 --> 00:10:03,250
We didn't. That's security camera
footage from your dressing room.

148
00:10:03,413 --> 00:10:06,211
He stole the scene and my money?
That's it!

149
00:10:06,373 --> 00:10:08,841
I demand you fire this felonious ham!

150
00:10:11,053 --> 00:10:14,409
The network execu-Bots are coming!
Oh, dear God!

151
00:10:19,693 --> 00:10:23,288
Presenting the president of the network!

152
00:10:27,893 --> 00:10:30,726
Greetings, gentlemen.
You already know my execu-Bots.

153
00:10:30,893 --> 00:10:33,726
Executive Alpha, programmed to
like things it has seen before.

154
00:10:33,893 --> 00:10:35,565
Hey, hey, hey.
Executive Beta.

155
00:10:35,733 --> 00:10:39,089
Programmed to roll dice to
determine the fall schedule.

156
00:10:39,613 --> 00:10:41,012
More reality shows!

157
00:10:41,173 --> 00:10:44,848
And Executive Gamma, programmed
to underestimate Middle America.

158
00:10:45,013 --> 00:10:47,891
It's funny, but is it going
to get them off their tractors?

159
00:10:48,053 --> 00:10:51,409
Now, who put this obnoxious
dancing robot on my network?

160
00:10:51,573 --> 00:10:53,882
We were about to fire him, sir.
Silence, hack!

161
00:10:54,053 --> 00:10:56,647
We've been monitoring our
Nielsen families carefully.

162
00:10:56,813 --> 00:11:00,522
And during the 12 seconds Bender was
on-Screen, viewer eyeball focus...

163
00:11:00,693 --> 00:11:03,048
Was up 90 percent!

164
00:11:04,733 --> 00:11:07,167
But, sir, children watch this show.

165
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:09,893
Bender's no role model.
He's a filthmonger.

166
00:11:10,053 --> 00:11:12,009
At our network, we love filth.

167
00:11:12,173 --> 00:11:16,052
Filthy rich, that is.
Being filthy rich, that is.

168
00:11:23,453 --> 00:11:26,445
"Bite my shiny metal ass"
could be a catchphrase.

169
00:11:26,613 --> 00:11:29,491
Eighty percent likely.
It will play in Peoria.

170
00:11:29,733 --> 00:11:31,086
Game shows are back!

171
00:11:31,253 --> 00:11:34,609
We need this edgy, sweeps-Ready
robot on our network!

172
00:11:34,773 --> 00:11:38,846
Bender, can you continue to drink,
smoke and steal things on TV?

173
00:11:39,013 --> 00:11:40,890
Yes, I can.

174
00:11:59,613 --> 00:12:02,332
Yeah, shooting!
All right!

175
00:12:11,653 --> 00:12:14,167
Yo. Check out what I jacked from my dad.

176
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:16,324
A cigar?!
Ripping!

177
00:12:18,893 --> 00:12:22,169
Look. I'm Bender!

178
00:12:25,413 --> 00:12:28,211
Ras H. Tafari!
What's going on here?

179
00:12:29,093 --> 00:12:33,609
The ruffians smoked one of your cigars.
That's not a cigar!

180
00:12:33,773 --> 00:12:38,164
And it's not mine.
Hey, Dad. Bite my shiny metal ass!

181
00:12:38,333 --> 00:12:41,803
What? Such an act would be most
uncomfortable for both of us!

182
00:12:41,973 --> 00:12:46,285
Where did you learn such language?
From Bender, my good jerkwad.

183
00:12:46,453 --> 00:12:50,651
Bender? That guy's really
starting to twist my dreads.

184
00:12:52,613 --> 00:12:56,652
Okay, okay! Get ready for this part!
Quiet, robot. Bender's on TV.

185
00:12:57,453 --> 00:13:00,650
Oh, Calculon. It's so good
to get away from the city...

186
00:13:00,813 --> 00:13:03,043
And that beastly yet intriguing Bender.

187
00:13:07,253 --> 00:13:09,244
And try this, kids at home!

188
00:13:11,773 --> 00:13:15,971
Is television sensation Bender a
bad role model for Earth 's children?

189
00:13:16,333 --> 00:13:18,051
That's crazy.

190
00:13:18,213 --> 00:13:22,525
A new protest group, Fathers Against
Rude Television, says "Hell, yes!"

191
00:13:22,973 --> 00:13:25,965
What kind of bozos would
start a Bender protest group?

192
00:13:26,453 --> 00:13:31,288
Good news, everyone! Hermes and I
have started a Bender protest group!

193
00:13:31,453 --> 00:13:32,568
That was uncanny.

194
00:13:32,733 --> 00:13:36,009
Fathers Against Rude Television don't
want our kids watching Bender's...

195
00:13:36,173 --> 00:13:38,687
High-Definition filth!
And for what?

196
00:13:38,853 --> 00:13:43,404
Some kind of cheap laugh?
That's not what F.A.R.T. is all about.

197
00:13:43,573 --> 00:13:45,643
No, sir! Not us F.A.R.T.Ers!

198
00:13:45,893 --> 00:13:50,011
You can't censor me just because
I'm an obscenely bad role model.

199
00:13:50,173 --> 00:13:53,051
As unclean as it makes me feel,
I agree with Bender.

200
00:13:53,213 --> 00:13:55,522
Kids don't turn rotten
just from watching TV.

201
00:13:55,693 --> 00:13:58,605
Yeah. Give a little credit
to our public schools.

202
00:14:03,893 --> 00:14:07,203
Our dads are all pumped
up on dork-Osterone.

203
00:14:07,373 --> 00:14:11,366
We're just trying to be cool, like Bender.
Yeah. And it's not even working.

204
00:14:11,533 --> 00:14:14,445
Smoking and drinking make us barf.
Gentle jerkwads

205
00:14:14,613 --> 00:14:18,526
I know how to emulate Bender without
barfing. We could commit a burglary.

206
00:14:18,693 --> 00:14:21,082
Hey, yeah!
Bender loves to burgle!

207
00:14:21,253 --> 00:14:24,768
Hold up, though. Who could we rob?
We don't know anyone with cool stuff.

208
00:14:24,933 --> 00:14:29,484
Duh. We know someone who runs
on pure cool fuel: Bender!

209
00:14:29,693 --> 00:14:32,526
Whoa!
We'll rob Bender!

210
00:14:32,693 --> 00:14:35,207
TV gave us the idea!

211
00:14:35,373 --> 00:14:36,931
You're watching Futurama

212
00:14:37,093 --> 00:14:41,211
The show that does not advocate
the cool crime of robbery.

213
00:14:48,733 --> 00:14:53,807
Okay. It's crime time.

214
00:15:02,173 --> 00:15:04,368
Hey, Bender.

215
00:15:04,693 --> 00:15:06,649
Hey, Bender.

216
00:15:07,213 --> 00:15:08,202
Hey, Bender.

217
00:15:11,173 --> 00:15:12,288
Hey, Bender.

218
00:15:32,613 --> 00:15:35,685
Oh!
What's going on in here?

219
00:15:37,333 --> 00:15:40,211
Oh. Now I'm really outraged!

220
00:15:40,373 --> 00:15:44,161
Where did you requisition this party?
And Zoidberg, what are you doing here?

221
00:15:44,333 --> 00:15:47,370
I'm networking.
Let me give you my card.

222
00:15:47,533 --> 00:15:50,650
Relax, Dad.
We just invited a few friends over.

223
00:15:50,893 --> 00:15:56,331
There's something wrong with your
story, but I can't put my finger on it.

224
00:15:56,493 --> 00:15:59,007
Of course! You don't have friends!

225
00:15:59,173 --> 00:16:02,768
Yeah! Why do these popular kids
consider you cool all of a sudden?

226
00:16:03,053 --> 00:16:05,692
We're just cool, is all.
Balderdash!

227
00:16:05,853 --> 00:16:09,641
I'll be the judge of who's cool,
using the Cool-O-Meter!

228
00:16:21,653 --> 00:16:23,530
Oh, yeah!

229
00:16:23,693 --> 00:16:27,652
Good Lord! I'm getting a
reading of over 40 mega-Fonzies.

230
00:16:27,813 --> 00:16:29,849
Everybody out!
Aw

231
00:16:31,653 --> 00:16:34,531
So do you guys know about
anything else going on?

232
00:16:34,693 --> 00:16:38,572
Because I'm totally
still ready to party.

233
00:16:38,813 --> 00:16:41,532
There's enough cool stuff here
to furnish a happening pad.

234
00:16:41,693 --> 00:16:43,092
Where did it all come from?

235
00:16:43,253 --> 00:16:47,212
Don't tell, comrades!
All for one and one for all!

236
00:16:47,373 --> 00:16:50,012
We stole it!
Oh, crumb.

237
00:16:53,613 --> 00:16:56,491
What? What's going on?
I'll tell you what!

238
00:16:56,653 --> 00:17:01,044
Our boys have taken up stealing.
One of the worst and coolest of crimes.

239
00:17:01,213 --> 00:17:04,091
And all from watching
you on TV, you cool jerk!

240
00:17:04,253 --> 00:17:05,368
Hey, lay off me!

241
00:17:05,533 --> 00:17:08,843
TV would stink if everyone on
it was a positive role model.

242
00:17:09,013 --> 00:17:12,528
Bender is about entertainment, baby!
You can't hold me responsible...

243
00:17:12,693 --> 00:17:16,368
For what kids do when--
Hey. This is my stuff they stole!

244
00:17:16,533 --> 00:17:20,367
That's the last straw! Bender
should not be allowed on television!

245
00:17:21,853 --> 00:17:23,844
Bender must be stopped!

246
00:17:24,013 --> 00:17:27,050
I've gone too far!
Who does that guy think I am?

247
00:17:27,213 --> 00:17:28,851
Yeah!
That's right!

248
00:17:29,013 --> 00:17:31,925
Come on! We're gonna march
all the way to Hollywood...

249
00:17:32,093 --> 00:17:35,608
And make them stop forcing
their filthy me down our throats!

250
00:17:35,773 --> 00:17:38,241
Yeah!

251
00:17:54,853 --> 00:17:57,845
Down with Bender! Down with Bender!

252
00:17:58,013 --> 00:18:01,244
Down with Bender! Down with Bender!

253
00:18:01,413 --> 00:18:03,369
This mob's with me.
Go ahead.

254
00:18:04,253 --> 00:18:07,563
Down with Bender! Down with Bender!

255
00:18:07,733 --> 00:18:10,770
Down with Bender! Down with--

256
00:18:13,453 --> 00:18:15,921
Bender! Down with Bender!

257
00:18:16,093 --> 00:18:19,608
As a doctor and captain
of this hospital ship...

258
00:18:19,773 --> 00:18:24,403
I now pronounce you man and
wife with six months to live.

259
00:18:25,373 --> 00:18:28,809
Listen up, Hollywood!
We're an exciting new mob!

260
00:18:28,973 --> 00:18:30,770
Yeah!
You better believe it.

261
00:18:30,933 --> 00:18:32,082
Great Shatner's ghost!

262
00:18:32,253 --> 00:18:35,484
We demand that all TVs be
equipped with a B-Chip...

263
00:18:35,653 --> 00:18:38,008
That blocks Bender from
appearing on the screen!

264
00:18:38,173 --> 00:18:39,322
Boo-Ya!
Yeah.

265
00:18:41,733 --> 00:18:45,043
I'm afraid the answer is
a gritty, in-Your-Face no.

266
00:18:45,213 --> 00:18:47,522
Then I quit!
Then you don't quit.

267
00:18:50,613 --> 00:18:53,252
I think you'll be finishing
the scene now, Mr. Bender.

268
00:18:53,413 --> 00:18:55,324
And don't skimp on the nasty.

269
00:18:55,493 --> 00:18:57,324
There'll be no further nasty!

270
00:18:57,493 --> 00:19:00,690
We still have the option
of resorting to violence!

271
00:19:00,853 --> 00:19:03,572
What makes you think that'll work?
I saw it on TV...

272
00:19:03,733 --> 00:19:07,885
In that episode where Bender
shot Calculon. How cool was that?

273
00:19:08,093 --> 00:19:09,970
Yeah! Come on!

274
00:19:10,133 --> 00:19:12,806
Quit the show!
Do the scene.

275
00:19:12,973 --> 00:19:14,770
I'm a cold-Blooded punk!

276
00:19:14,933 --> 00:19:18,323
I once put a laugh track on a
sitcom that had no jokes in it.

277
00:19:18,493 --> 00:19:21,769
Hey, look! The prop guy has a lamp!
Really?

278
00:19:22,013 --> 00:19:24,686
Aha!
I was using that!

279
00:19:24,853 --> 00:19:27,287
Listen up, because I've
got a climactic speech.

280
00:19:27,453 --> 00:19:29,762
You, cameraman, keep the camera rolling!

281
00:19:29,933 --> 00:19:32,845
You, director! Give me my motivation!
You're angry.

282
00:19:33,013 --> 00:19:37,450
Perfect! Viewers of the world,
do smoking and drinking on TV...

283
00:19:37,613 --> 00:19:40,844
Really make me cool?
Of course they do!

284
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:45,131
How about committing crimes and
violence? Again, the answer is yes.

285
00:19:45,333 --> 00:19:49,292
But do we really want our kids
exposed to that kind of trash on TV?

286
00:19:49,453 --> 00:19:52,684
I say absolutely not!
Oh!

287
00:19:54,973 --> 00:20:00,206
On the other hand, most, perhaps all,
the blame rests with the parents.

288
00:20:00,373 --> 00:20:03,365
That's right, you!

289
00:20:03,613 --> 00:20:06,810
And so I ask you this one question:

290
00:20:06,973 --> 00:20:10,852
Have you ever tried simply
turning off the TV...

291
00:20:11,013 --> 00:20:12,844
Sitting down with your children...

292
00:20:13,013 --> 00:20:14,287
And hitting them?

293
00:20:14,453 --> 00:20:17,525
We're just so busy.
Well, make time.

294
00:20:17,693 --> 00:20:18,967
And cut!

295
00:20:19,613 --> 00:20:24,209
Good enough. Splice in some reaction
shots of me and shove it on the air.

296
00:20:26,653 --> 00:20:30,089
Have you ever tried simply
turning off the TV...

297
00:20:30,253 --> 00:20:32,164
Sitting down with your children...

298
00:20:32,333 --> 00:20:33,527
And hitting them?

299
00:20:35,053 --> 00:20:38,807
Well, I'd say we all learned a
valuable lesson about TV there.

300
00:20:38,973 --> 00:20:39,962
What was it?

301
00:20:40,133 --> 00:20:43,967
That we should all take
TV a little less seriously.

302
00:20:44,133 --> 00:20:47,125
And more importantly,
turn it off once in a while.

303
00:20:47,293 --> 00:20:49,011
Hear, hear!
Darn right!

304
00:20:49,173 --> 00:20:50,970
So should we turn it off now?

305
00:20:51,213 --> 00:20:55,126
Well That depends what's on.
One now...

306
00:20:55,293 --> 00:20:59,605
Nothing good.
Let's just keep watching.
