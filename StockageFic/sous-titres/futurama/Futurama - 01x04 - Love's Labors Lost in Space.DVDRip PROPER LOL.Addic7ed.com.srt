1
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:08,120
What a great choice. Amazing food!
And such generous portions.

2
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:10,680
Just wait till you try the mints.

3
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:13,600
Doug, most guys are put off by my eye.

4
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:16,280
It's nice to meet someone open-minded.

5
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:20,120
Ew!

6
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:27,640
Love's Labour Lost in Space

7
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:51,000
What went wrong last night?

8
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:54,400
I don't know.
I couldn't put my finger on it.

9
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,760
Possibly his vile lizard tongue.

10
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:58,320
You're too picky.

11
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:02,240
If you rule out every guy
with a lizard tongue or low l.Q. . .

12
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:05,040
. . .or a temper,
you're gonna be lonely.

13
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:08,440
There's nothing wrong
with having high standards.

14
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,040
Leela's problem is purely medical.

15
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:15,240
She'll drop her eggs.
They'll hatch and all will be well.

16
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:17,200
Give guys a chance.

17
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:22,440
You think a guy is a pig, but then
you realize he has a good body.

18
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:25,200
Thank you for the inspiring advice.

19
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:27,440
But I'm happy with my life.

20
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:29,680
That sounds like a cry for help.

21
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:33,240
Let's go out.
There's great places to meet people.

22
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:35,920
-The Sex Bureau.
-A saucy puppet show.

23
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:38,240
A rotting whale carcass.

24
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:40,000
I'll pick.

25
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:49,840
Oh, wow! It's totally retro!

26
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:54,240
-Why's everyone wearing rings?
-Because nobody wears them anymore.

27
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:57,000
-Rings are stupid.
-They look cool.

28
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,040
Don't let anyone hear you!

29
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,400
Did he say rings are cool?

30
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:04,040
-No, he said they're stupid.
-Cool!

31
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:08,200
What do you think of that guy?

32
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:11,040
-I don't know. Maybe.
-Forget it. He's gay.

33
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,960
What? How can you tell?

34
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:16,520
I just know these things.
I've got "gaydar. "

35
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,200
There's no such thing.

36
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:20,000
No?

37
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:26,440
Okay, I got a lock on him.

38
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:27,840
Yep! He's gay.

39
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:29,720
-Are you sure?
-Definitely!

40
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:33,000
Or it's interference
from a gay weather balloon.

41
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:38,000
You're from the 20th century?
That's incredible. I'm from the 21 st!

42
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:40,440
We've got so much in common!

43
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:44,320
We sure do. Remember when
the cyborgs enslaved humanity?

44
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:47,080
Yeah! That rings a bell.

45
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,320
This is Bolt Rolands.

46
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:53,200
He's a hyper-sled racer
with 1 0 wins on the pro circuit.

47
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,000
Hello, beautiful.

48
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,440
I think she means 1 0 wins
on the gay circuit.

49
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:01,440
I wish. Those cats can really fly.

50
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,720
M'oh.

51
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:21,640
This is M-5438,
an entity of pure energy.

52
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:24,960
Great. But he's just
not what I'm looking for.

53
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:29,400
I understand. One day you will
evolve beyond your physical body.

54
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:33,200
And on that day, I hope
you will pick up the phone.

55
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,600
You're impossible.

56
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:38,840
Just as well.
He comes from a dimension. . .

57
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:41,040
. . .that's big on musical theater.

58
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:51,640
I need the apartment.
Go see a saucy puppet show.

59
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:53,160
Can do!

60
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:59,800
My, my, my.
What's a beautiful lady like you--?

61
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:03,600
Oh, my! I'm sorry!
I thought you had two eyes.

62
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:09,200
Leela, you must've had your pick
last night at closing time.

63
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:12,280
Could you stop talking
about my personal life?

64
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:15,880
Yes, let's talk about
Leela's personal life later.

65
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:18,120
We have business to attend to.

66
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:22,200
-A delivery?
-A tax-deductible mission of charity.

67
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,800
ROBOTIC VOICE:
This is Vergon 6.

68
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,080
This is Vergon 6.

69
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,000
Buh!

70
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:33,320
It's a sunny little doomed planet
inhabited by frisky, doomed animals.

71
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,320
-Animals?
-That's right.

72
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:38,040
Animals in need of rescue.

73
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:42,840
Vergon 6 was once filled with
the dense substance "Dark Matter. "

74
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:47,480
Each pound of it weighs over
1 0,000 pounds.

75
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,840
Wait. What about the animals?

76
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:53,560
Well, Dark Matter is valuable
as starship fuel.

77
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:57,440
That's why it was mined out,
leaving the planet hollow.

78
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:59,520
But what about the animals?

79
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,720
-The--?
-The animals.

80
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:06,720
I didn't mention animals. The planet
will collapse within three days.

81
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,400
This will kill all the animals.

82
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:13,000
We have to save two of each kind.
Like Noah's Ark.

83
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,600
Why two?

84
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,160
Oh.

85
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,280
[GIGGLES]

86
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:24,320
I bet Leela's holding out
for a one-eyed guy.

87
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:25,840
That'll take forever.

88
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:29,600
She ought to find a guy
with two eyes and poke one out.

89
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,600
That'd be a timesaver.

90
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:32,920
Do you mind?

91
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:35,240
You can use this as a poker.

92
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:40,120
Thanks, if it's less than five,
I don't care how many eyes he has.

93
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:45,400
I want a guy who's adventurous, self-
confident, maybe a snappy dresser.

94
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:48,960
These new uniforms are snappy,
first officer.

95
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,840
I suppose, captain.

96
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:53,720
I'm not a big fan
of velour as you are.

97
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:56,520
What do you want
to do about that ship?

98
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:57,760
Destroy them!

99
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:03,600
That's got a nice feel to it.

100
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:08,400
ZAPP:
Captain's journal. Stardate, 3000.3.

101
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:10,320
KIF:
Who are you talking to?

102
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:13,000
You. Aren't you getting this?

103
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:19,440
A vessel is attempting to break
the security cordon around Vergon 6.

104
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:24,520
I'm anticipating a tactical dogfight,
followed by a light dinner.

105
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,880
Ravioli, ham, sundae bar. . . .

106
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,640
Hey, look! Zapp Brannigan's ship.

107
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:34,040
-Wow! The Zapp Brannigan?
-Uh-huh.

108
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:35,800
Who's the Zapp Brannigan?

109
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:38,160
Shall I fire on them now, sir?

110
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,360
Not yet, Kif.

111
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:43,800
In the game of chess, never let
your adversary see your pieces.

112
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,360
What?

113
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:48,800
Zapp Brannigan alone
saved the Octillion System. . .

114
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,160
. . .from rampaging Killbots.

115
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,920
-Wow!
-A grim day for robot-kind.

116
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,360
But we can build more Killbots!

117
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:01,240
He's the most decorated captain
in the Order of Planets.

118
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,240
Leela's got a boyfriend!

119
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:07,720
No, but we ought to see
if he'll help us rescue those animals.

120
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:11,720
In case you hit it off,
you'll want to take this with you.

121
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:16,000
They're headed for us.

122
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:20,320
A calculated move out of Sun Tzu's
classic text, The Art of War.

123
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:24,200
Or my own masterwork,
Zapp Brannigan 's Big Book of War.

124
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:27,760
The one thing their captain
doesn't realize is--

125
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:30,120
They've docked and come aboard.

126
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:34,040
Then I've risked all and lost.
I'll be in the escape pod.

127
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:38,800
If that wicker chair I like survives,
have it sent to my P.O. box.

128
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:46,240
I'm Leela, captain of
the Planet Express delivery ship.

129
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:48,600
We're pleading for assistance.

130
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:49,840
If there's--

131
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:52,320
I'm in command. Zapp Brannigan.

132
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:55,320
Has my fame preceded me,
or was I too quick?

133
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,200
Oh, not at all.

134
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:00,360
I'm just so really thrilled
to meet you.

135
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:04,040
You're an impressive captain,
beautiful and deadly.

136
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:06,960
-A potent combination.
-You don't mean that.

137
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:11,200
I haven't seen more than
three captains sexier than you.

138
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,400
Only one who was deadlier.

139
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:16,000
I heard you defeated a horde. . .

140
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:19,080
. . .of somethings
in the something system.

141
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:23,040
The Killbots?
Simply a matter of outsmarting them.

142
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:25,240
I never would've thought of that.

143
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,640
Killbots have a preset kill limit.

144
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:31,520
Knowing that, I sent wave
after wave of my own men at them. . .

145
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:33,600
. . .until they shut down.

146
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:36,800
Kif, show them the medal I won.

147
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:42,240
More, please. A little more.

148
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,720
More. Keep going.

149
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:47,640
We need to talk about our mission.

150
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:50,280
I'm willing to put wave after wave. . .

151
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:53,240
. . .of men at your disposal.
Right, men?

152
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:54,560
MAN:
You suck!

153
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:57,800
We're hoping to save the animals
of Vergon 6.

154
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:59,720
-If you could--
-Vergon 6!

155
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:02,400
-This dinner is over.
-What's wrong?

156
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:06,640
The Order of Planets prohibits
interfering with other worlds.

157
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,800
It's a little rule known
as "Brannigan's Law. "

158
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:14,240
People already interfered.
That planet was mined hollow.

159
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:17,240
By an Order of Planets mining crew.

160
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,640
This doesn't make any sense.

161
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:23,560
I don't pretend to understand
Brannigan's Law. I enforce it.

162
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,200
Fine, we'll save the animals alone.

163
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:29,400
I'm afraid I can't allow that.
Guards!

164
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:33,400
-What just happened?
-He's throwing us in prison.

165
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,400
Dang! Can I get this wrapped up?

166
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:39,920
Ow!

167
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:45,040
I might've liked Zapp if he
hadn't thrown me in prison.

168
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:47,040
You really are too picky.

169
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:49,440
Kif, follow me up to the deck.

170
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:52,200
