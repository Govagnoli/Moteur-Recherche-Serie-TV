1
00:00:07,293 --> 00:00:09,363
Futurama [5x06] - Less Than A Hero - CiWaN

2
00:00:35,613 --> 00:00:38,081
Your call is being--
Connected.

3
00:00:38,253 --> 00:00:41,450
By SewerCom.
Reach out and touch the sewers.

4
00:00:42,733 --> 00:00:44,803
Look, Morris! It's Leela calling!

5
00:00:44,973 --> 00:00:48,329
Hi, Mom! Hi, Dad! Ready for
your big trip to the surface?

6
00:00:48,533 --> 00:00:51,445
We're excited, honey, but we
don 't want to embarrass you.

7
00:00:51,613 --> 00:00:53,922
I mean, your mother and
I are basically monsters.

8
00:00:54,133 --> 00:00:57,205
Dad, relax. You are being so mutant.

9
00:00:57,413 --> 00:01:02,407
I found this adorable little bag to
wear over my head. And it was on sale!

10
00:01:02,613 --> 00:01:05,525
No one's wearing anything adorable
over their head. Now listen.

11
00:01:05,693 --> 00:01:09,971
I could never, ever be ashamed of my
parents. I'll see you this weekend.

12
00:01:11,373 --> 00:01:13,841
Hey, guess who I just got
off the video phone with.

13
00:01:14,013 --> 00:01:15,605
No!
My parents!

14
00:01:15,773 --> 00:01:19,083
They're coming up from the
sewers for a visit Sunday.

15
00:01:19,293 --> 00:01:21,807
Are you off your rocket?
Your parents are mutants.

16
00:01:21,973 --> 00:01:24,009
It's illegal for them
to come above ground...

17
00:01:24,173 --> 00:01:26,084
Because they're inferior genetic scum.

18
00:01:26,253 --> 00:01:27,971
Present company excluded, of course.

19
00:01:28,173 --> 00:01:31,210
I'm getting them a special one-Day
surface permit from city hall.

20
00:01:31,413 --> 00:01:33,927
While you're there, could
you get me a license to kill?

21
00:01:34,133 --> 00:01:36,283
Sure. Bare hands or weapon?

22
00:01:36,453 --> 00:01:38,762
What does piano wire count as?

23
00:01:38,933 --> 00:01:40,332
Good news, anyone.

24
00:01:40,533 --> 00:01:44,970
The Swedish robot from Pi-Kea is here
with the super-Collider I ordered.

25
00:01:45,173 --> 00:01:48,245
Enjoy your affordable Swedish crap.

26
00:01:54,413 --> 00:01:56,085
Let's see what tools we'll need.

27
00:01:57,453 --> 00:02:00,729
Uh-Huh. Uh-Huh. Uh-Huh.

28
00:02:00,893 --> 00:02:02,246
All right, we're all set.

29
00:02:02,453 --> 00:02:07,481
Nothing like the rustic wholesomeness
of working with one's own hands.

30
00:02:17,413 --> 00:02:20,564
There. Finished.
And only six missing pieces.

31
00:02:20,773 --> 00:02:23,492
Those Swedes know how to put
in almost everything you need.

32
00:02:23,693 --> 00:02:28,687
Man, I'm sore all over. I feel like
I just went 10 rounds with mighty Thor.

33
00:02:28,853 --> 00:02:31,048
I feel like I was mauled by Jesus.

34
00:02:32,853 --> 00:02:35,811
I've got just the thing.
Genuine miracle cream...

35
00:02:35,973 --> 00:02:38,612
I bought from a traveling salesman.

36
00:02:38,893 --> 00:02:42,010
"Come one, come all! " He said.
"Step right up! "

37
00:02:42,173 --> 00:02:44,562
"This sounds too good to be true,"
I thought.

38
00:02:44,733 --> 00:02:47,805
He said I looked like a smart young man!

39
00:02:47,973 --> 00:02:50,328
"So is it a deal?" I inquired.

40
00:02:50,493 --> 00:02:53,644
Two hours later, he was
gone with 60 of my dollars!

41
00:02:53,813 --> 00:02:57,169
But I had the miracle cream.

42
00:02:58,893 --> 00:03:02,568
Bad news, nobody.
The super-Collider super exploded!

43
00:03:02,773 --> 00:03:06,368
I need you to take it back and
exchange it for a wobbly CD rack...

44
00:03:06,533 --> 00:03:10,208
And some of those rancid meatballs.

45
00:03:13,133 --> 00:03:14,725
Excuse me. Hi.
Do you have a minute?

46
00:03:14,933 --> 00:03:17,845
I live in Jersey City. My car
broke down, and my aunt's sick.

47
00:03:18,013 --> 00:03:21,050
She needs this medicine, but I need
bus money, so I'm mugging you.

48
00:03:21,213 --> 00:03:24,489
Hand over your wallets!
I don't believe that story for a second.

49
00:03:24,693 --> 00:03:28,208
It doesn't matter, I'm mugging you!
There's no bus to Jersey City.

50
00:03:28,413 --> 00:03:30,722
Give me your wallets now,
or my robot will shoot!

51
00:03:30,893 --> 00:03:33,327
Don't make me hurt you.

52
00:03:34,373 --> 00:03:36,170
I'm too scared to find my pocket.

53
00:03:36,333 --> 00:03:39,530
Here, I'll just take off
my pants and give you those.

54
00:03:39,733 --> 00:03:44,011
Hey! I don't like what I'm seeing!
Give it to him, Andrew!

55
00:03:47,493 --> 00:03:49,529
Give it to him again, Andrew!

56
00:03:54,653 --> 00:03:59,568
What the--? Laser-Proof shirts, huh?
Well, I'll show you!

57
00:04:00,013 --> 00:04:01,969
Hey! Quit it!

58
00:04:08,813 --> 00:04:12,692
Foiled. And after years of planning.
You're out of the gang.

59
00:04:14,933 --> 00:04:18,812
How did we manage to survive?
What gave us those strange powers?

60
00:04:18,973 --> 00:04:21,567
Maybe we're wearing magic rings,
but they're invisible

61
00:04:21,733 --> 00:04:25,248
So we don't even realize it.
Also, you can't feel the rings.

62
00:04:26,573 --> 00:04:28,803
Fry! Shut up and look at this!

63
00:04:29,533 --> 00:04:32,206
"May cause super powers
in humans. "

64
00:04:32,413 --> 00:04:36,008
Wow! A super-Powers drug you
can just rub into your skin?

65
00:04:36,173 --> 00:04:37,970
You'd think you'd have to freebase it.

66
00:04:38,133 --> 00:04:41,489
Let's see, which powers do we have?
"Super strength"?

67
00:04:44,613 --> 00:04:47,889
Yep.
Lickity speed?

68
00:04:48,053 --> 00:04:50,089
Check.
Yes, sir.

69
00:04:50,293 --> 00:04:52,932
<i>Ability to command the
loyalty of sea creatures. </i>

70
00:04:53,253 --> 00:04:56,404
Hey, Zoidberg, get in here!
Screw you!

71
00:04:56,573 --> 00:04:57,722
Ain't got that.
Nope.

72
00:04:57,933 --> 00:04:59,446
Wow! Super powers!

73
00:04:59,613 --> 00:05:03,128
I'll be able to pack my day with
twice as many humdrum activities.

74
00:05:03,333 --> 00:05:05,449
Leela, I think you're
missing the big picture.

75
00:05:05,613 --> 00:05:07,968
When you were a kid,
what was your biggest fantasy?

76
00:05:08,333 --> 00:05:10,085
To have parents.
Whatever.

77
00:05:10,253 --> 00:05:12,403
The correct answer is,
to be a superhero!

78
00:05:12,573 --> 00:05:17,442
We have super powers, and we're
Americans. This is our chance.

79
00:05:17,613 --> 00:05:20,844
Hm. I have been looking for
a way to serve the community...

80
00:05:21,013 --> 00:05:22,765
That incorporates my violence.

81
00:05:22,933 --> 00:05:25,925
Let's do it!
You'll barely regret this.

82
00:05:26,093 --> 00:05:29,608
Hey! A friend of mine said he mugged
you today, and you had super powers!

83
00:05:29,813 --> 00:05:32,247
It's true.
Thanks to this funky-Fresh cream.

84
00:05:32,413 --> 00:05:35,325
Now me and Leela are forming
an awesome crime-Fighting duo!

85
00:05:35,533 --> 00:05:37,922
Wow! Crime fighting! Cool!

86
00:05:38,093 --> 00:05:41,403
You say you're a duo?
Yeah, duos are good.

87
00:05:41,573 --> 00:05:44,531
Of course, sometimes they're
a little short-Handed.

88
00:05:44,693 --> 00:05:46,172
See you.

89
00:05:46,733 --> 00:05:50,646
With two humans, you'd think there'd be
a robot in there to balance things out.

90
00:05:50,813 --> 00:05:53,373
But whatever.

91
00:05:55,053 --> 00:06:00,002
I have these three costumes you could
use, but I guess I'll just throw one away.

92
00:06:00,213 --> 00:06:01,965
We'd love to have you on the team.

93
00:06:02,133 --> 00:06:04,522
But aren't you more on
the supply side of crime?

94
00:06:04,693 --> 00:06:07,730
Plus, the cream won't give you
super powers. You're a robot.

95
00:06:07,933 --> 00:06:12,609
So? I'm already super strong,
and my arms do this:

96
00:06:18,013 --> 00:06:20,447
Also, I got this going:

97
00:06:26,453 --> 00:06:31,004
Listen up, New New York! There's
a new group of superheroes in town!

98
00:06:31,173 --> 00:06:33,050
And we're--
Quiet! It's 4 a.M

99
00:06:33,213 --> 00:06:36,250
And I just fell asleep for
the first time in 30 years!

100
00:06:36,413 --> 00:06:37,732
Sorry!

101
00:06:38,293 --> 00:06:42,411
A new era of justice has begun.
What?

102
00:06:45,533 --> 00:06:48,491
Attention all crooks,
lowlifes and lawbreakers.

103
00:06:48,653 --> 00:06:51,804
Do yourselves a favor and crawl
back into your filthy tenements...

104
00:06:51,973 --> 00:06:57,172
You human cockroaches, or get your
ugly face punched to custard by...

105
00:06:57,373 --> 00:06:59,045
The New Justice Team!

106
00:06:59,213 --> 00:07:03,491
Captain Yesterday!
Clobberella!

107
00:07:03,653 --> 00:07:06,884
And Super King!
The best one of the three!

108
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:08,492
Yow!

109
00:08:09,053 --> 00:08:10,247
Ta-Da!

110
00:08:13,093 --> 00:08:17,848
Captain Yesterday, I find your
skintight high-Waters incredibly sexy.

111
00:08:18,013 --> 00:08:19,366
Let's get together sometime.

112
00:08:19,573 --> 00:08:22,690
Sure! I'm listed in the phone book,
so once I reveal my real name...

113
00:08:22,853 --> 00:08:25,686
Along with my address and a
copy of my birth certificate--

114
00:08:25,853 --> 00:08:29,562
Are you crazy? We have to keep
our secret identities secret.

115
00:08:29,733 --> 00:08:32,725
From everybody?
Especially from everybody!

116
00:08:32,933 --> 00:08:34,252
Give several reasons why.

117
00:08:34,453 --> 00:08:37,570
For one, superheroes cause
a lot of collateral damage...

118
00:08:37,733 --> 00:08:39,530
And we don't want to get our butts sued.

119
00:08:39,853 --> 00:08:43,209
Or do we? No, I guess not.

120
00:08:43,413 --> 00:08:47,531
Also, if our identities get out,
every crook in the city will be after us.

121
00:08:47,693 --> 00:08:53,802
Or, God forbid, our loved ones.
Super King has no need for loved ones.

122
00:08:54,613 --> 00:08:55,728
How you doing, kid?

123
00:08:58,973 --> 00:09:02,010
There you go.
Two one-Day mutant surface passes.

124
00:09:02,213 --> 00:09:03,965
Thank you, Mayor Poopenmeyer.

125
00:09:05,293 --> 00:09:08,729
Mayor here. What's that?
A horrible crime in the works?

126
00:09:08,893 --> 00:09:13,569
Ruthless villain? Citizens in danger?
That's fantastic news!

127
00:09:13,733 --> 00:09:17,442
Because I get to summon
the New Justice Team!

128
00:09:19,413 --> 00:09:20,528
Shh.

129
00:09:21,533 --> 00:09:24,730
They're usually here by now.
Well, so long. Keep in touch.

130
00:09:24,933 --> 00:09:26,730
Wait! Stay and meet the superheroes!

131
00:09:26,893 --> 00:09:29,965
There's three of you and three
of them, so it'll be perfect!

132
00:09:34,133 --> 00:09:37,648
Is this clown on?
Where are those daring crime-Stoppers?

133
00:09:37,853 --> 00:09:42,244
Oh, I completely forgot!
I left my apartment on fire!

134
00:09:42,413 --> 00:09:47,123
As for me, I'm late for my LSATs.

135
00:09:47,333 --> 00:09:50,291
And I can't take life anymore!

136
00:09:54,293 --> 00:09:59,162
Clobberella! Captain Yesterday!
My liege. You're just in time.

137
00:10:00,053 --> 00:10:02,886
We've received a tip that the
Museum of Natural History...

138
00:10:03,053 --> 00:10:05,726
Will be robbed tomorrow
at exactly 9 a.M.

139
00:10:05,893 --> 00:10:08,965
The target: the priceless
Quantum Gemerald.

140
00:10:09,173 --> 00:10:10,606
Who's the perp?

141
00:10:10,773 --> 00:10:13,162
A dangerous villain
known as the Zookeeper...

142
00:10:13,333 --> 00:10:16,370
Who commits crimes aided by a
pack of highly trained animals!

143
00:10:16,573 --> 00:10:18,291
Pack of highly. Got it!

144
00:10:18,493 --> 00:10:21,883
His crew includes a badger with a
troubled past and nothing left to lose.

145
00:10:22,053 --> 00:10:24,442
An elephant who never forgets to kill.

146
00:10:24,613 --> 00:10:31,086
And a seldom-Used crab named Lucky,
a.k.a. Citizen Snips.

147
00:10:32,213 --> 00:10:36,092
You can count on us, Mr. Mayor!
Justice away!

148
00:10:38,693 --> 00:10:40,365
Hold the elevator!

149
00:10:50,413 --> 00:10:51,732
We're in here too.

150
00:10:51,893 --> 00:10:54,123
Leela, how you gonna
meet your folks tomorrow?

151
00:10:54,293 --> 00:10:57,808
We've already scheduled the Zookeeper
for a 9 a.m. foiling at the museum.

152
00:10:58,013 --> 00:11:00,811
Not a problem. I've cleverly
arranged to meet my parents...

153
00:11:00,973 --> 00:11:03,328
Right there at the same museum at 10.

154
00:11:03,533 --> 00:11:07,082
Nine, ten, a big fat hen.

155
00:11:08,413 --> 00:11:10,165
The name's Bender.

156
00:11:24,093 --> 00:11:29,008
I can't believe the Zookeeper is this
late for his own heist. It's just rude!

157
00:11:30,773 --> 00:11:32,650
Total hell! It's 10!

158
00:11:32,813 --> 00:11:37,204
I'm supposed to meet my parents,
and I'm still in my secret costume!

159
00:11:37,413 --> 00:11:39,210
There they are!

160
00:11:40,613 --> 00:11:44,162
How can Leela not be here?
Do you think she forgot?

161
00:11:44,333 --> 00:11:46,847
Relax.
I'm sure she's just ashamed of us.

162
00:11:47,013 --> 00:11:50,210
Yo, freak jobs! Hit the
nearest manhole, pronto-Like!

163
00:11:50,493 --> 00:11:55,089
But we have passes that allow us to
be up here. From the mayor himself.

164
00:11:55,733 --> 00:11:58,850
I don't know.
I never heard of no mayor.

165
00:12:01,333 --> 00:12:03,403
The Zookeeper!

166
00:12:03,573 --> 00:12:05,529
Sorry I'm late. Long story.

167
00:12:05,733 --> 00:12:10,966
Now, everybody hit the deck! I'm cutting
the entire line and stealing the exhibit!

168
00:12:11,133 --> 00:12:13,772
You're not stealing anything!
Nobody hit the deck!

169
00:12:13,933 --> 00:12:18,006
Ah, the superheroes.
Or should I say, super zeros?

170
00:12:18,333 --> 00:12:22,292
That was uncalled for.
Animals, attack!

171
00:12:35,013 --> 00:12:38,449
Please do not feed the animals!

172
00:12:49,293 --> 00:12:53,525
You're going down, my friend!
Down under!

173
00:12:56,373 --> 00:12:59,570
Man boxing a kangaroo
is a peculiar spectacle.

174
00:12:59,773 --> 00:13:04,688
But a kangaroo boxing a robot?
Now I'm afraid you've lost me.

175
00:13:05,413 --> 00:13:07,563
Citizen Snips!

176
00:13:14,653 --> 00:13:17,451
Nice job, Fingers.

177
00:13:18,253 --> 00:13:22,849
I'm scared and confused. I think we
wandered into an off-Broadway play.

178
00:13:23,013 --> 00:13:24,810
No, there are way too many people here.

179
00:13:27,253 --> 00:13:31,292
Later, if anyone asks when I got away,
tell them right now!

180
00:13:33,253 --> 00:13:36,086
Forget it, Zookeeper.
You're going into captivity!

181
00:13:36,293 --> 00:13:41,413
Fool! A quip about putting me behind
bars would have been far more delicious!

182
00:13:42,253 --> 00:13:46,610
Here, catch!
No, Fry! You can't fall fast enough!

183
00:13:49,933 --> 00:13:53,164
I got it! I got it!
I don't got it!

184
00:13:55,613 --> 00:13:57,410
You saved the Gemerald!

185
00:13:57,653 --> 00:14:02,283
Yet the Zookeeper escaped, thus proving
that the deadliest animal of all...

186
00:14:02,453 --> 00:14:05,445
Is the Zookeeper.
You can get off me anytime.

187
00:14:05,813 --> 00:14:10,170
Oh, no! My parents are leaving!
I've gotta go change back into street Leela.

188
00:14:10,373 --> 00:14:13,604
It's the New Justice Team!
Thank you, mysterious heroes!

189
00:14:13,813 --> 00:14:16,452
The value of the Gemerald you
saved is slightly greater...

190
00:14:16,613 --> 00:14:19,207
Than the cost of the damage
you caused to this museum!

191
00:14:19,373 --> 00:14:22,410
A net gain for our great city!

192
00:14:27,453 --> 00:14:32,481
It's good that Leela doesn't love us.
She'll be less sad when we die.

193
00:14:40,373 --> 00:14:41,362
Ow.

194
00:14:41,573 --> 00:14:44,292
Mom? Dad? I showed up!

195
00:14:44,453 --> 00:14:48,492
And I got the audio tour for
Treasures of Liberace's Tomb!

196
00:15:03,973 --> 00:15:07,852
Sweetie, it's okay. You don't have
to apologize for standing us up...

197
00:15:08,013 --> 00:15:10,447
On the only visit to the
surface we'll ever have.

198
00:15:10,653 --> 00:15:13,804
I want to tell you why
I didn't show up, but I can't.

199
00:15:13,973 --> 00:15:17,283
Just please believe me that
it was a very good reason.

200
00:15:17,453 --> 00:15:20,092
I'm sorry I disappointed you.

201
00:15:21,093 --> 00:15:23,732
Leela, you could never disappoint us.

202
00:15:23,893 --> 00:15:28,284
We're so proud of everything that
you are, and we always will be.

203
00:15:28,533 --> 00:15:30,683
Because you're our baby girl.

204
00:15:33,413 --> 00:15:39,886
Oh, I can't take it!
Mom, Dad, I'm Clobberella!

205
00:15:42,253 --> 00:15:46,132
Galloping gators!
You're a superhero?

206
00:15:46,293 --> 00:15:47,965
Well, that's wonderful!

207
00:15:48,133 --> 00:15:50,567
But did you have to make
the costume so revealing?

208
00:15:50,893 --> 00:15:56,047
Look at me! Proud dad of a superhero!
We should print up T-Shirts!

209
00:15:56,213 --> 00:15:59,285
And F-Shirts for our friends
with two arms on the same side!

210
00:15:59,493 --> 00:16:03,805
No, listen, it's very important
that you never, ever tell anyone...

211
00:16:03,973 --> 00:16:05,372
Under any circumstance.

212
00:16:05,653 --> 00:16:08,850
What if I've had a few?
Dad, you drink?

213
00:16:09,013 --> 00:16:12,892
No, not even then!
All right. My sucker is sealed.

214
00:16:13,053 --> 00:16:17,171
In fact, I shouldn't even
be wearing this around here.

215
00:16:17,933 --> 00:16:21,926
It was brisk. I dressed in layers.
That's my girl.

216
00:16:27,213 --> 00:16:31,809
So anyway, my daughter's Clobberella.
Leela is Clobberella?

217
00:16:31,973 --> 00:16:34,646
You're pulling me!
Keep it under your sock.

218
00:16:34,853 --> 00:16:37,367
It's a big secret.
That's why I'm only telling you two.

219
00:16:37,533 --> 00:16:40,001
Oh, my God!
That guy's daughter is Clobberella!

220
00:16:40,173 --> 00:16:43,165
But don't tell anyone.
Gotcha!

221
00:16:46,333 --> 00:16:49,370
Greetings, superheroes. Remember me?

222
00:16:50,373 --> 00:16:53,445
I don't remember much, buddy!
And you're no looker.

223
00:16:53,653 --> 00:16:58,010
Professor, isn't it time for your nap?
Yes, damn it!

224
00:17:02,613 --> 00:17:05,252
Zookeeper, how did you
know our real identities?

225
00:17:05,453 --> 00:17:09,731
Let's just say a little bird told me.

226
00:17:09,933 --> 00:17:13,608
Leela told her parents.
Leela's parents blabbed.

227
00:17:14,773 --> 00:17:18,925
Leela? Ls the person that parrot is
mimicking telling the truth by proxy?

228
00:17:19,093 --> 00:17:23,052
Yes. My parents were so hurt,
I couldn't help it.

229
00:17:23,253 --> 00:17:26,768
But I distinctly told
them not to tell anyone.

230
00:17:26,933 --> 00:17:29,731
We are not amused!

231
00:17:29,933 --> 00:17:33,687
And here's something you may
or may not find interesting.

232
00:17:36,613 --> 00:17:40,401
Mom! Dad!
Leela, please forgive us!

233
00:17:40,573 --> 00:17:44,407
Especially your father, who's the one
who told. Thank you very much, Morris!

234
00:17:44,613 --> 00:17:49,641
Are you all right? Has he hurt you?
No, but my allergies are going nuts.

235
00:17:49,813 --> 00:17:50,882
Oh, God!

236
00:17:51,053 --> 00:17:54,443
Every couch and table has
animal fur all over it.

237
00:17:54,613 --> 00:17:56,285
He lets them climb on everything!

238
00:17:56,493 --> 00:17:58,643
All right, Zookeeper,
what do you want?

239
00:17:58,853 --> 00:18:02,846
Why, the Quantum Gemerald, of course.
You must steal it for me by midnight...

240
00:18:03,013 --> 00:18:06,642
Or your parents will be devoured by
piranhas that I have, shall we say...

241
00:18:06,813 --> 00:18:10,726
Persuaded to walk on dry land.

242
00:18:10,893 --> 00:18:16,570
Save us, Leela! I mean, if you
don 't have anything better to do!

243
00:18:18,333 --> 00:18:21,086
We're out of options.
We have to steal the Gemerald.

244
00:18:21,293 --> 00:18:24,649
But should superheroes commit a crime?
Even to save lives?

245
00:18:24,813 --> 00:18:27,566
I need moral guidance! Bender?

246
00:18:27,733 --> 00:18:31,612
The thought of stealing anything
fills Super King with disgust.

247
00:18:31,773 --> 00:18:36,893
But if it must be so, then
let a museum heist be pulled!

248
00:18:41,733 --> 00:18:44,406
Oh, no! Our super-Power
cream is out of itself!

249
00:18:44,613 --> 00:18:48,606
Check inside the cap.
There might be a caked-In gold mine.

250
00:18:49,573 --> 00:18:51,848
El Zilcho.
I'm afraid we're boned.

251
00:18:52,093 --> 00:18:56,132
El Zilcho. Hey, is it too late
to change my superhero name?

252
00:19:00,893 --> 00:19:05,125
Just be cool. Nobody knows
we're super-Powerly challenged.

253
00:19:05,813 --> 00:19:08,088
Man, this costume is so damn heavy.

254
00:19:08,293 --> 00:19:11,524
Hey, Captain Yesterday? Can l, like,
wail on you with this two-By-Four...

255
00:19:11,693 --> 00:19:14,969
And it doesn't hurt you?
Ow! That didn't hurt.

256
00:19:15,933 --> 00:19:18,128
Hi, superheroes. Everything okay?

257
00:19:18,333 --> 00:19:21,723
Big O, little K, my friend.
Just checking if everything's all right.

258
00:19:21,933 --> 00:19:25,130
It's okay, all right.
Okay, then.

259
00:19:25,293 --> 00:19:26,851
Grab it!

260
00:19:28,453 --> 00:19:32,048
Yo! The superheroes have
turned evil! Most uncool!

261
00:19:32,253 --> 00:19:33,481
Get them!

262
00:19:33,653 --> 00:19:38,249
Stay back, or we'll beat the tar
out of you using super powers!

263
00:19:38,413 --> 00:19:41,132
Whoo-Ooah.

264
00:19:48,333 --> 00:19:50,642
So this is your lair?
Of course not!

265
00:19:50,813 --> 00:19:55,011
You think I'd show you my lair?
My lair's a million times nicer than this.

266
00:19:55,213 --> 00:19:57,010
Okay. Take it easy.

267
00:19:57,173 --> 00:19:59,846
Well, here's your lousy Gemerald.

268
00:20:00,013 --> 00:20:01,810
Hawk, fetch!

269
00:20:03,973 --> 00:20:06,362
That seemed unnecessary.

270
00:20:08,053 --> 00:20:12,922
Our transaction is complete.
Come, Solomon, to the lair!

271
00:20:13,733 --> 00:20:16,645
Mom! Dad! Oh, I'm so sorry
I got you kidnapped...

272
00:20:16,813 --> 00:20:19,725
By a crazy madman who tried
to feed you to piranhas.

273
00:20:19,893 --> 00:20:22,646
We're just happy to be
involved in your life.

274
00:20:22,853 --> 00:20:24,366
No, no, it's my fault...

275
00:20:24,533 --> 00:20:27,252
For telling you I was a superhero.
That's true.

276
00:20:27,453 --> 00:20:30,365
I just couldn't stand to have
you think I was ashamed of you.

277
00:20:30,573 --> 00:20:31,801
That's sweet, honey.

278
00:20:31,973 --> 00:20:35,852
But it's natural for children to be
a little ashamed of their parents.

279
00:20:36,053 --> 00:20:38,283
Oh, yeah.
Just like it's natural for parents...

280
00:20:38,453 --> 00:20:41,525
To be a little disappointed in
their children. Not that we are.

281
00:20:41,693 --> 00:20:45,288
But you could call a little more often.
Okay.

282
00:20:45,493 --> 00:20:48,451
And would it kill you
to use some mouthwash?

283
00:20:49,813 --> 00:20:53,203
Hey, Fry, we've still got our costumes on.
Wanna steal some more stuff?

284
00:20:53,373 --> 00:20:55,807
I guess.
As long as you think it's right.

285
00:20:55,973 --> 00:20:59,409
Superheroes away!
