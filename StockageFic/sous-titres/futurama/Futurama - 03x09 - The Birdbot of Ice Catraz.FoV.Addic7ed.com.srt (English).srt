1
00:00:07,255 --> 00:00:09,405
Birdbot of IceCatraz

2
00:00:32,695 --> 00:00:37,052
Those cookies are fresh-a-licious,
but they produce a lot of trash.

3
00:00:51,175 --> 00:00:54,451
That head spray makes
your antenna smell nice.

4
00:00:54,695 --> 00:00:57,414
- Thank you.
- But it's damaging the planet.

5
00:00:57,655 --> 00:01:00,123
So? It's not the only one we've got.

6
00:01:00,375 --> 00:01:05,893
Good news! I'm sending you
on an extremely controversial mission.

7
00:01:06,095 --> 00:01:09,007
- Controversial?
- Oh, my, no.

8
00:01:09,215 --> 00:01:14,448
<i>For this highly controversial mission,
you'll be towing the Juan Valdez...</i>

9
00:01:14,655 --> 00:01:18,489
...an orbiting supertanker
full of Colombian dark matter.

10
00:01:18,735 --> 00:01:21,932
Oil? What if we hit something,
and the tanker leaks?

11
00:01:22,175 --> 00:01:25,804
lmpossible.
The tanker has 6000 hulls.

12
00:01:26,015 --> 00:01:29,928
So, unlike me,
it's entirely leakproof.

13
00:01:30,135 --> 00:01:33,684
Once you've hauled the tanker
past the protestors...

14
00:01:33,935 --> 00:01:37,325
- Protestors?
- Correct. Six thousand hulls.

15
00:01:37,575 --> 00:01:41,284
Why do we fly within three feet
of this penguin preserve?

16
00:01:41,535 --> 00:01:43,412
To avoid the tollbooth.

17
00:01:45,095 --> 00:01:48,405
She's restocked with emergency jam.
Let's get going.

18
00:01:48,655 --> 00:01:53,490
At the risk of sounding negative, no.
I can't participate in this mission.

19
00:01:53,655 --> 00:01:55,293
What are you yapping about?

20
00:01:55,455 --> 00:01:58,845
Your reckless disregard
for the environment!

21
00:01:59,095 --> 00:02:01,211
I'm gonna join those protestors.

22
00:02:01,455 --> 00:02:06,006
This is an outrage. I demand you
hand over your captain's jacket.

23
00:02:06,175 --> 00:02:09,133
This is my normal jacket.
I've had it 1 0 years.

24
00:02:09,375 --> 00:02:12,253
I said, hand it over.

25
00:02:13,175 --> 00:02:17,805
Well, Fry, or should I say
Captain Fry?

26
00:02:18,055 --> 00:02:21,013
No, I shouldn't.
Bender is the new captain.

27
00:02:21,255 --> 00:02:22,688
- Bender?
- That's right.

28
00:02:22,855 --> 00:02:25,653
Being captain
is about intuition and heart.

29
00:02:25,895 --> 00:02:28,045
A good captain can't have either.

30
00:02:28,295 --> 00:02:32,004
That's why cold, logical Bender
is perfect for the job.

31
00:02:32,255 --> 00:02:35,213
I do think of human life
as expendable.

32
00:02:35,415 --> 00:02:38,213
No fair!
Leela was training me to be captain.

33
00:02:38,415 --> 00:02:42,169
She let me sit on her lap and steer,
in this comic I drew.

34
00:02:42,335 --> 00:02:44,212
The new one's out!

35
00:02:44,455 --> 00:02:47,686
The title of captain
may inflate the human ego...

36
00:02:47,895 --> 00:02:52,013
...but it's beneath the notice
of my mighty robo-logic.

37
00:02:52,215 --> 00:02:56,288
Now, look spry, men.
We launch at six bells.

38
00:03:06,055 --> 00:03:11,846
Greetings. I'm Free Waterfall Sr.,
founder of Penguins Unlimited.

39
00:03:12,015 --> 00:03:14,768
No applause.
When you clap your hands...

40
00:03:14,935 --> 00:03:19,770
...you kill thousands of spores that'll
someday form a nutritious fungus.

41
00:03:19,975 --> 00:03:23,854
Just show your approval
with a mold-friendly thumbs up.

42
00:03:24,095 --> 00:03:26,655
Please hold your thumbs until the end.

43
00:03:26,895 --> 00:03:30,934
It's time to stop that tanker
with a nonviolent human circle.

44
00:03:31,135 --> 00:03:34,445
Why resort to nonviolence?
Can't we kick their asses?

45
00:03:34,695 --> 00:03:38,244
Little lady, those people's asses
are living things too.

46
00:03:43,775 --> 00:03:46,926
We're hitched up tighter
than Davy Jones' U-Haul.

47
00:03:47,135 --> 00:03:49,410
- At ease, men.
- I am at ease.

48
00:03:49,615 --> 00:03:53,051
I like to give my first mate
an informal nickname.

49
00:03:53,295 --> 00:03:56,412
From now on,
you'll be known as Wiggles.

50
00:03:56,655 --> 00:04:01,251
The hell I will. Have you even read
the captain's handbook?

51
00:04:01,455 --> 00:04:05,243
I have now. What's Peter Parrot's
first rule of captaining?

52
00:04:05,455 --> 00:04:08,447
"Always respect
the chain o' command," captain.

53
00:04:08,695 --> 00:04:14,406
Correct, Wiggles. You've just earned
an invitation to the captain's table.

54
00:04:14,615 --> 00:04:17,925
The captain's table? What an honor.

55
00:04:19,295 --> 00:04:24,005
Our peace ring has them trapped
like a tiger in a washing machine.

56
00:04:25,735 --> 00:04:28,966
- Get ready.
- Look at that. Here they come.

57
00:04:33,095 --> 00:04:37,930
Didn't you realize spaceships
can move in three dimensions?

58
00:04:38,175 --> 00:04:39,210
No, I did not.

59
00:04:48,815 --> 00:04:53,286
That tanker gave us the slip,
but we'll stop them here on Pluto.

60
00:04:53,535 --> 00:04:58,290
If you're cold, rub your bodies with
permafrost. It's nature's long johns.

61
00:04:58,775 --> 00:05:02,927
If rubbing dirt in your crotch
is wrong, I don't wanna be right.

62
00:05:03,695 --> 00:05:06,846
This here is our penguin preserve.

63
00:05:07,575 --> 00:05:12,205
They're so cute, like if puppies
and kittens could have babies.

64
00:05:12,455 --> 00:05:17,404
We use hand puppets around young ones
to simulate a natural environment.

65
00:05:22,215 --> 00:05:25,013
That's adorable.

66
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:31,804
It's this medal I'm most proud of.

67
00:05:32,015 --> 00:05:36,054
I won it for saving the children
of Earth from a giant kangaroo.

68
00:05:36,255 --> 00:05:38,974
It was on Australian news.
You didn't see it.

69
00:05:39,135 --> 00:05:42,013
- Brilliant.
- Would you cram a sock in it?

70
00:05:42,255 --> 00:05:47,010
Those aren't even medals. They're
bottle caps and pepperoni slices.

71
00:05:47,855 --> 00:05:49,288
Thank you, steward.

72
00:05:49,535 --> 00:05:52,811
Weren't you about to toast
your gallant captain?

73
00:05:53,015 --> 00:05:57,611
Fine, I've got a toast.
To Captain Bender. He's the best...

74
00:05:57,815 --> 00:06:01,410
...at being a jerk, and his ugly face
is as dumb as a butt.

75
00:06:01,615 --> 00:06:03,094
I've heard better.

76
00:06:03,295 --> 00:06:06,492
If I were in charge,
I wouldn't treat you like this.

77
00:06:06,655 --> 00:06:08,611
You're nothing but a blowhard.

78
00:06:09,455 --> 00:06:12,811
Sir, you forget yourself. Shut up.

79
00:06:17,695 --> 00:06:22,132
Being captain is more important to you
than being my friend. I'm going.

80
00:06:22,295 --> 00:06:27,813
Going? But a captain can't drink
without his first mate.

81
00:06:30,255 --> 00:06:34,009
- You can drink with me, maybe?
- I don't feel like drinking.

82
00:06:34,255 --> 00:06:36,007
Then if you'll excuse me...

83
00:06:36,175 --> 00:06:40,009
...I see some ravioli
that only has two shoe prints on it.

84
00:06:40,255 --> 00:06:41,608
Three.

85
00:06:58,375 --> 00:07:02,414
Please have some liquor.
Robots need alcohol to function.

86
00:07:02,615 --> 00:07:06,324
I once knew a guy...
You look like him.

87
00:07:06,575 --> 00:07:09,408
He wasn't neither...

88
00:07:09,655 --> 00:07:14,854
- I'm a good captain.
- Please, I love you like a father!

89
00:07:19,335 --> 00:07:21,565
Oh, I hope they read my sign!

90
00:07:25,495 --> 00:07:30,364
- Bender's too low and upside down.
- He must be talking on a cell phone.

91
00:07:41,655 --> 00:07:46,445
- What's happening?
- All 6000 hulls have been breached.

92
00:07:46,655 --> 00:07:52,252
Fools. If only they'd built it with
6001 hulls. When will they learn?

93
00:08:07,535 --> 00:08:11,528
<i>Continuing our coverage of a tragic,
but faraway, story.</i>

94
00:08:11,735 --> 00:08:15,967
<i>The crisis on Pluto worsens
as dark matter spreads.</i>

95
00:08:16,175 --> 00:08:19,451
<i>The images are truly horrific.</i>

96
00:08:25,055 --> 00:08:30,573
<i>I don 't think any of us can understand
how those poor penguins feel.</i>

97
00:08:32,215 --> 00:08:34,809
<i>Oily humanoid.</i>

98
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:41,009
<i>At the time of the crash, the captain
had an alcohol level of. 08 percent...</i>

99
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:45,003
<i>... well below the legal limit
for robots.</i>

100
00:08:45,255 --> 00:08:50,807
As your lawyer, I declare y'all
are in a 1 2-piece bucket of trouble.

101
00:08:51,015 --> 00:08:54,849
But I struck you a deal.
Five hours of community service...

102
00:08:55,015 --> 00:08:56,687
...cleaning up that mess.

103
00:08:56,935 --> 00:09:01,008
Five hours? Couldn't you have
just gotten me the death penalty?

104
00:09:01,255 --> 00:09:04,725
I'd have done better,
but it's hard pleading a case...

105
00:09:04,895 --> 00:09:07,807
...while awaiting trial
for incompetence.

106
00:09:08,015 --> 00:09:10,654
Good luck with that.

107
00:09:27,535 --> 00:09:31,414
Now, you stay away
from those Puffin twins.

108
00:09:32,135 --> 00:09:36,094
To avoid frostbite,
put your hands between your buttocks.

109
00:09:36,335 --> 00:09:38,007
That's nature's pocket.

110
00:09:38,215 --> 00:09:42,413
- I'll check on Bender.
- Watch so he doesn't pick your pocket.

111
00:09:46,895 --> 00:09:48,613
Can't beat fresh-squeezed.

112
00:09:48,815 --> 00:09:53,206
Bender, can you at least pretend
you're being punished?

113
00:09:54,375 --> 00:09:56,127
Clean the black parts too.

114
00:09:58,135 --> 00:10:00,774
Are they black with white feathers...

115
00:10:00,935 --> 00:10:05,690
...or white with black feathers?
- Don't matter. They're all beautiful.

116
00:10:05,935 --> 00:10:10,725
Yo, screws, more Tegrin over here.
What's this?

117
00:10:27,895 --> 00:10:30,125
Man, he got away.

118
00:10:30,495 --> 00:10:32,133
This is why chief says no hugging.

119
00:10:34,415 --> 00:10:37,646
Good work, everyone.
I suggest you get some sleep.

120
00:10:37,895 --> 00:10:44,414
I'm gonna stay up singing songs about
penguins in a fine, piercing tenor.

121
00:10:44,615 --> 00:10:50,053
Has anyone seen Bender? Bender!
Here robot, robot, robot.

122
00:10:51,895 --> 00:10:54,853
Why weren't you Kong donkeys
cleaning up?

123
00:10:55,095 --> 00:10:58,770
They sent us inside
for doing an unsatisfactory job.

124
00:10:58,975 --> 00:11:02,285
- And eating penguin eggs.
- You ate most of them.

125
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:07,649
Where's Captain Bender?
Off catastrophizing some other planet?

126
00:11:07,895 --> 00:11:13,447
- Damn it, Fry! He's still your captain!
- He didn't come back with the group.

127
00:11:13,695 --> 00:11:14,810
- He didn't?
- No.

128
00:11:15,015 --> 00:11:18,803
It's 20 degrees below absolute zero.
I better go find him.

129
00:11:19,015 --> 00:11:23,293
Wait. Bender and I have disagreements,
but we're still friends...

130
00:11:23,495 --> 00:11:26,805
...and I'm gonna show him
what that means.

131
00:11:27,855 --> 00:11:28,924
To the ship.

132
00:11:29,175 --> 00:11:32,611
Why don't you walk?
He was only 20 yards from here.

133
00:11:32,855 --> 00:11:34,686
Madam, I am in command now.

134
00:11:34,935 --> 00:11:39,565
Such a man. I'd follow him
to hell and back, I would.

135
00:11:53,575 --> 00:11:55,213
What the...?

136
00:11:58,775 --> 00:12:03,212
What's this water made of, ice?
Forget this!

137
00:12:44,455 --> 00:12:48,926
I don't think we're on Pluto.
We may have left space as we know it.

138
00:12:49,175 --> 00:12:50,403
Then where are we?

139
00:12:50,615 --> 00:12:55,006
- You said you knew how to navigate.
- Stop yelling at me.

140
00:14:08,215 --> 00:14:13,005
It's worse than we thought. It seems
dark matter is nature's sex drug.

141
00:14:13,255 --> 00:14:18,807
It's like a mix of penguin estrogen,
penguin Viagra and Spanish penguin fly.

142
00:14:19,055 --> 00:14:21,888
- It's making them ultrafertile.
- How ultra?

143
00:14:22,095 --> 00:14:25,212
A garden-variety penguin
lays one egg a year.

144
00:14:25,415 --> 00:14:29,886
Since the spill, our penguins
lay six eggs every 1 5 minutes!

145
00:14:30,095 --> 00:14:33,007
Also, the eggs hatch in only 1 2 hours!

146
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:36,013
Also, the males are laying eggs!

147
00:14:37,735 --> 00:14:40,613
This man has overgasped!

148
00:14:40,975 --> 00:14:44,047
Soon, there will be too many
birds to count.

149
00:14:44,255 --> 00:14:49,727
Before long, they will exhaust
their food supply and starve to death.

150
00:14:49,935 --> 00:14:55,009
If only we hadn't flown penguins
to Pluto and dumped oil on them.

151
00:14:55,215 --> 00:15:00,972
- Can't we stop them from multiplying?
- Yes. Thankfully, we have a plan.

152
00:15:01,175 --> 00:15:04,850
- What is it? We'll do anything!
- Grab your guns.

153
00:15:05,055 --> 00:15:09,333
I declare penguin hunting season
officially open!

154
00:15:18,415 --> 00:15:21,964
Isn't there some way
to keep them from breeding?

155
00:15:22,175 --> 00:15:25,292
Cold showers don't work
on Antarctic creatures.

156
00:15:25,495 --> 00:15:30,364
Surely, a quick semipainless death
is better than weeks of starvation.

157
00:15:30,575 --> 00:15:32,805
Well, I suppose.

158
00:15:33,055 --> 00:15:37,367
But I joined Penguins Unlimited
to love penguins, not hunt them.

159
00:15:37,575 --> 00:15:39,293
The two are one and the same.

160
00:15:39,495 --> 00:15:44,091
Now, are you with us, or are you
gonna let innocent penguins suffer?

161
00:15:45,255 --> 00:15:50,045
Oh, God, it's inhuman!
It's like Hong Kong! I'll do it!

162
00:15:51,495 --> 00:15:55,488
That's a good old-fashioned gun.
Rifle check!

163
00:15:55,695 --> 00:15:58,607
- Oh, yeah!
- Wee doggy!

164
00:15:58,815 --> 00:16:00,692
You're enjoying this!

165
00:16:00,895 --> 00:16:06,174
Look, if you have to shoot penguins,
you might as well enjoy it.

166
00:16:06,375 --> 00:16:10,288
Sorry, if it's fun in any way,
it's not environmentalism.

167
00:16:10,535 --> 00:16:15,290
- Really? How about blowing up dams?
- Yeah, that is fun.

168
00:16:15,495 --> 00:16:17,326
Let's conservate!

169
00:16:20,895 --> 00:16:23,728
It's been an honor to serve under you!

170
00:16:30,215 --> 00:16:32,524
This is for their own good.

171
00:16:32,775 --> 00:16:37,087
Don't leave orphans.
Gotta kill entire families.

172
00:16:40,255 --> 00:16:46,728
They're so cute. No! You can do this.
It's like murdering a little butler.

173
00:16:46,975 --> 00:16:49,887
I can't look.

174
00:16:54,535 --> 00:16:58,494
Oh, no! What have I done?!

175
00:17:02,295 --> 00:17:04,684
You poor little guy!

176
00:17:05,015 --> 00:17:07,290
I'm so sorry l... Bender?!

177
00:17:15,815 --> 00:17:18,648
Were you hiding out with these guys?

178
00:17:18,855 --> 00:17:21,005
Of course not! Filthy ice rats!

179
00:17:21,215 --> 00:17:22,807
Scat! Shoo!

180
00:17:23,495 --> 00:17:25,406
What are you doing? Get away!

181
00:17:25,615 --> 00:17:29,654
- They love you.
- Well, I don't love them.

182
00:17:35,175 --> 00:17:38,485
I don't know why,
but when I look at their faces...

183
00:17:38,695 --> 00:17:42,483
...it makes me want to puke!
In a good way.

184
00:17:52,535 --> 00:17:54,605
Stop! Stop shooting!

185
00:17:54,815 --> 00:17:57,568
- It's me! Leela!
- Sorry.

186
00:17:57,775 --> 00:18:01,688
Why aren't you firing at them?
Don't you want to help them?

187
00:18:01,895 --> 00:18:06,366
- Not this way.
- You're not a tree-hugging kook at all!

188
00:18:06,575 --> 00:18:09,965
I don't know if shooting penguins
will help or not.

189
00:18:10,175 --> 00:18:15,568
But the decision shouldn't be in the
hands of people who kill just for fun.

190
00:18:15,775 --> 00:18:19,404
You may just be farming
some free-range truth there.

191
00:18:20,015 --> 00:18:24,167
But we already made 200 pounds
of batter for penguin tempura.

192
00:18:24,375 --> 00:18:28,288
- Okay, boys, it's them or us!
- No!

193
00:18:29,055 --> 00:18:31,125
- Where did they...?
- Attack!

194
00:18:47,495 --> 00:18:50,726
Make sure they use every part
of my body!

195
00:18:50,975 --> 00:18:53,170
I'll avenge your death, son!

196
00:18:53,655 --> 00:18:57,443
They used to be peaceful.
I suppose this was your doing?

197
00:18:57,655 --> 00:19:01,887
I taught them if it ain't black
and white, peck and bite.

198
00:19:02,095 --> 00:19:05,485
Now, to take off my tuxedo...

199
00:19:08,815 --> 00:19:12,490
Guys, it's me, your lovable dictator!

200
00:19:19,055 --> 00:19:20,966
If only we had a toboggan!

201
00:19:23,575 --> 00:19:25,884
Faster! Faster!

202
00:19:41,135 --> 00:19:45,287
Right, they can swim.
It's all coming back to me now.

203
00:19:50,415 --> 00:19:52,133
- It's Fry!
- Wiggles?

204
00:19:59,775 --> 00:20:02,733
At least it'll help
reduce their population.

205
00:20:02,935 --> 00:20:06,894
Yeah, life is hilariously cruel.

206
00:20:12,015 --> 00:20:14,483
- Permission to come aboard?
- Granted.

207
00:20:14,695 --> 00:20:18,483
We can't take off without our captain.

208
00:20:20,175 --> 00:20:22,405
And bring my toboggan.

209
00:20:25,695 --> 00:20:30,325
- Were you able to help the penguins?
- Sure. I mean, not really.

210
00:20:30,535 --> 00:20:32,969
Nature will work itself out.

211
00:20:33,135 --> 00:20:36,286
It can't screw up any worse
than we did, right?

212
00:20:36,455 --> 00:20:37,444
I don't know.

213
00:20:37,615 --> 00:20:44,054
Quit worrying! Thanks to my influence,
those stupid birds will do just fine.
