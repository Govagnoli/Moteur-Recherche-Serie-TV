00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:04,830
Futurama <i>is brought to you by...</i>

2
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:09,950
<i>... Arachno Spores,</i>
<i>the fatal spore with the funny name.</i>

3
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:17,390
Lesser of Two Evils

4
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,431
Cop Department <i>is real.</i>

5
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:41,557
<i>The people are not actors.</i>

6
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,716
<i>Most aren 't even people.</i>

7
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,957
<i>Come on, man.</i>
<i>I didn 't fire off no laser.</i>

8
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:50,988
<i>Then why is there a smoking hole</i>
<i>in your ceiling?</i>

9
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:54,232
<i>Crazy upstairs lady's</i>
<i>been shooting down.</i>

10
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:57,517
<i>You're on the top floor</i>
<i>of this domicile.</i>

11
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:00,518
<i>Get that f* * *ing camera</i>
<i>out of my house!</i>

12
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:04,435
J<i>ust relax, ma 'am.</i>
<i>Sir? Put down the lamp.</i>

13
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:06,636
<i>Okay, I'm cooperating.</i>

14
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:08,757
<i>That's it.</i>
<i>Put up your hands.</i>

15
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,514
<i>Nice and slow.</i>
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

16
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:16,117
- W<i>hile you're at it, unblur your face.</i>
<i>- Oh, man!</i>

17
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:19,557
Bender, you said you were
in this episode.

18
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:24,629
No. I'm on <i>Caught on Tape Three</i>
for what I did in the coffee pot.

19
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:29,910
<i>I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.</i>
<i>I'm</i> j<i>ust going through some things.</i>

20
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:35,516
<i>I'm going in.</i>

21
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:38,878
Cop Department
<i>will be right back.</i>

22
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:42,470
<i>Is today's lifestyle making you tense</i>
<i>and impatient?</i>

23
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:44,033
Shut up and get to the point!

24
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:47,949
<i>Then relive the carefree</i>
<i>days of yore at Past-O-Rama...</i>

25
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:53,149
<i>... where old New York comes alive.</i>
<i>- It's like living in the year 2000.</i>

26
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:56,312
<i>Time for the mammoth hunt, dudes.</i>

27
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:05,514
<i>- Let's disco dance, Hammurabi.</i>
<i>- "Dy-no-mite!"</i>

28
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:08,556
<i>Located on the former site</i>
<i>of Brooklyn.</i>

29
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,917
Sounds like your kind of place.
Wanna go?

30
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:15,351
If I ever wanna go back,
I'll freeze myself again.

31
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:20,429
Come on, Fry! I want to see it.
You know I yearn for a simpler time...

32
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,955
...of barn dances and buggy rides...

33
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:26,397
...before life was cheapened
by heartless machines.

34
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:28,909
But Bender, you are a...

35
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:36,280
It's like the good old days.

36
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,914
Give me your wallet
or I'll cut you!

37
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:42,917
Get a picture of me being "mugged. "

38
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,832
Give me the camera too!

39
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,712
Learning is fun.

40
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:53,319
Ancient Wall Street.

41
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,719
- No!
- I'm ruined!

42
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:07,797
I direct your attention
to this ancient tablet.

43
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,150
Which has yet to be deciphered.

44
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:12,510
- Do you know?
- Yes. A cop told me.

45
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,352
It means, "Up yours. "

46
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:17,956
I'm really enjoying the day out
with you people.

47
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:21,954
Hey, a suicide booth!
So long, suckers!

48
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:24,953
Sorry, Bender,
that's just a phone booth.

49
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:28,909
- What were they used for?
- In New York? Bathrooms.

50
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,111
I'll be out in a second.

51
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,275
"Tokens only. "
How does this work?

52
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:39,833
I'll show you.

53
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:43,713
It's a turnstile.

54
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,428
What's this?

55
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:54,117
- Another bathroom?
- It's a mobile apartment with no rent.

56
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:57,314
Come on, Fry, get up!

57
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:07,751
The tomb of the 20th century's
greatest spiritual leader...

58
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,035
...AI Sharpton.

59
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,957
Now, this guy had taste.

60
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:15,913
He was mummified
in ceremonial vestments.

61
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,469
We called it a "jogging suit. "

62
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:24,717
<i>Old New York's traffic</i> j<i>ams...</i>

63
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:28,396
<i>... were a public forum</i>
<i>for the exchange of opinions.</i>

64
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,472
Move it, crap for brains!

65
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,318
Get on, bastard man!

66
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:35,432
<i>It all started</i>
<i>with Gerald Ford's invention...</i>

67
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:39,958
<i>... the Automo-Car,</i>
<i>powered by a tank of burning fossils.</i>

68
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:42,714
<i>Here is a 20th century</i>
<i>assembly line...</i>

69
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:47,317
<i>... where cars were constructed</i>
<i>by primitive robots.</i>

70
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:53,916
We've come a long way, baby.

71
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:59,799
<i>The fruit of the robot's labor was</i>
<i>the stately 1</i> 99<i>2 Latoura.</i>

72
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:04,199
My girlfriend had one!
Actually, she wasn't my girlfriend...

73
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:07,392
...she just never closed
her curtains.

74
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:11,593
Didn't I tell you to end
your stories a sentence earlier?

75
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:14,712
Let's sneak in for a closer look.

76
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:20,554
We don't touch the antiques, sir.

77
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:25,032
I'm sorry. You work here.
I should have known from that getup.

78
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:30,150
This is from Miller's Outpo...
I mean, yeah, I work here all right.

79
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:34,319
Move this rust bucket out behind
Saint Koch's cathedral.

80
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,955
Did you drive much, Fry?

81
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:44,318
No one in New York drove.
There was too much traffic.

82
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,873
Nice.
Listen to that baby purr.

83
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,310
There's a baby in there, huh?

84
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,314
It's just like riding a bicy...

85
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:21,754
- I think I got whiplash.
- How? You don't have a neck.

86
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:23,951
I meant ass whiplash.

87
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:27,914
I'm glad we hit something.
I thought we'd never stop.

88
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,914
I think I got whiplash.

89
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,712
How's that robot I hit?

90
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,713
We did all we could.

91
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:56,278
- You mean he's...
- Good as new? Yes!

92
00:06:56,520 --> 00:07:00,638
Leela, Zoidberg, the rest of you,
this is Flexo.

93
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:05,391
Except for that stylish beard,
he looks just like Bender!

94
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:08,068
No duh! We're both bending units.

95
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:10,157
What's your serial number?

96
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:12,032
3370318.

97
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:16,916
No way! Mine's 2716057.

98
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:23,152
- I don't get it.
- We're both the sum of two cubes.

99
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:28,472
Sorry about crushing your body, Flexo.
You okay now?

100
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:31,513
Well, I don't feel as bad as you look.

101
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:35,754
I'm just messing with you.
You're okay.

102
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,709
That's some face you've got.
There's a cream for that.

103
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:44,554
- No. You're great.
- Is there anything I can do for you?

104
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:49,430
Your stunt did a number on my back.
You mind rubbing it for me?

105
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:50,715
Sure.

106
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:53,030
That's it.
A little lower.

107
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,157
- How's that?
- Lower.

108
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:59,313
- That's it. A little lower, though.
- I can't get any lower.

109
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,353
I'll say.
You're rubbing my ass!

110
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,519
Check it out.
Six beautiful devices.

111
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:16,032
They know what you like, and they
do it to within one micron.

112
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:20,558
- Spin those fans, baby.
- Yeah, baby!

113
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,155
All right, mama!

114
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,994
- Spin it, baby.
- Gyrate it, honey!

115
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:34,513
I don't like this place.
It's 120 with little oxygen.

116
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,517
Shut up and hoot.

117
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:42,869
- Yeah!
- All right!

118
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:51,113
Hubba-hubba! She is built!
In Mexico, I believe.

119
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:55,233
And that ain't silicon.
It's tungsten, and plenty of it.

120
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:58,836
Yeah.
Look at that exhaust fan.

121
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:02,118
- Pervert.
- Yoo-hoo...

122
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:09,915
Thanks, moderate spender.
Select erotic transaction.

123
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:12,953
How about a lap dance
for my pal here?

124
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,117
No.
That's all right. Really.

125
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:27,909
There's something about Flexo
I don't like.

126
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,515
Hey, Fry? Think fast!

127
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,514
Get it? It's chlorine!

128
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:41,635
- It's funny because it's poisonous.
- Keep laughing, shrimp.

129
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:44,348
He's bad news.
I regret hitting him.

130
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:47,478
Take a rage dump.
He's no worse than Bender.

131
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:51,554
He is. He drinks, smokes
and posts naked photos of me.

132
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:54,519
- That's Bender.
- I'm talking about Flexo.

133
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:59,396
I get it. This is cute.
You're jealous of Bender's new friend.

134
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,034
No, I'm not! Mark my words:

135
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:05,636
Flexo's evil.
He's the evil Bender.

136
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,188
Rage dump.

137
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:13,520
Good news, everyone. Report to
my bedroom for a private exhibition.

138
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:19,032
Everyone, get in bed with me.
I have something to show you.

139
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,118
Feast your eyes...

140
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,311
...on this!

141
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:28,159
It's beautiful!

142
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,753
And huge!

143
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,149
Can I touch it?

144
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,833
What is it, already?

145
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:35,349
It's a single atom of Jumbonium.

146
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:40,076
An element so rare the nucleus alone
is worth more than $50,000.

147
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:42,191
- How much more?
- 100,000.

148
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:44,868
That's why I hid it
under my mattress.

149
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:47,674
Can we discuss this somewhere else?

150
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,199
Why certainly.

151
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:52,633
The atom sits atop
this dime-store tiara...

152
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:58,079
...to be awarded to the winner
of the Miss Universe Pageant.

153
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:01,551
Your job is to deliver it,
safe and sound.

154
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:05,719
When I was a little girl,
I dreamed of being Miss Universe.

155
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:07,109
That's pathetic.

156
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:10,312
Deep down,
all girls wanna be Miss Universe.

157
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:11,834
- Not me.
- Really?

158
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:14,310
Maybe it's just cute girls.

159
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:19,310
The atom's value would bankrupt
Planet Express, if it were stolen.

160
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:23,394
We'll need to hire additional security
for the mission.

161
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:26,029
Mister Professor, right here!

162
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:28,748
We should stick with people we know.

163
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,560
- Flexo's great, but...
- Flexo's great?

164
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,631
That's good enough for me.

165
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:36,912
Welcome aboard, lad.

166
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,873
Space <i>bandidos</i> are operating nearby.

167
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:50,640
You'll take eight-hour guard shifts.

168
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:53,035
Bender, then Flexo, then Fry.

169
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:56,511
Wait. Hold on.
Let's go alphabetically.

170
00:11:56,760 --> 00:12:00,116
Okay. Bender, then Flexo, then Fry.

171
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,435
Go by rank.

172
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:04,831
Okay. Bender, then Flexo, then Fry.

173
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,314
Flexo outranks me?

174
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:09,711
That's "Flexo outranks me, sir! "

175
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,958
- Who goes there?
- Don't point that at me.

176
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:20,994
I know Flexo's your friend,
but I don't trust him.

177
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:24,829
Just because he has a beard
you label him as evil?

178
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:29,153
I've got a label for you,
an ugly word called "prejudice. "

179
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:32,830
- I'm not prejudiced.
- Save it for the cross burning, Adolf!

180
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:40,830
- Keeping an eye on the safe?
- You know it!

181
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:45,795
Looks like it's my shift.
Lie down and go off-line for a while.

182
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:48,110
All right.

183
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:59,159
Caught you!
You were looking at the atom.

184
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,316
So? I look at lots of atoms.

185
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:06,116
- Shouldn't you rest up for your shift?
- You'd like me to fall asleep.

186
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:09,118
Whatever it takes to shut your yapper.

187
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:11,317
I'm just kidding you.

188
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:14,956
Here's a joke:
I'm gonna sit here until my shift.

189
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:17,594
- Suit yourself, skinbag.
- I will.

190
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:21,031
- Good!
- Good!

191
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:23,755
Good!

192
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,712
That's eight hours.

193
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:31,155
Eight hours of solid boredom.

194
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:34,710
I'm kidding.
You're a wonderful man.

195
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:38,912
Finally, the atom is safe.

196
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:59,118
What is it?

197
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:01,470
My God!
Did you hear maracas?

198
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,591
- No.
- It wasn't space <i>bandidos.</i>

199
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:05,034
Lock the ship.

200
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:07,708
- Don't let Flexo escape.
- Aye, aye.

201
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:12,710
It appears Flexo has outwitted us all.
Especially me...

202
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,757
...Bender.

203
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,631
How did he steal the atom?

204
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:23,957
By using a sleep ray.
Sleep rays exist, right?

205
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,196
- No.
- Then I fell asleep.

206
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:28,755
You were sure right about Flexo.

207
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,560
The ship's locked.
He may have escaped.

208
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:34,758
Thanks, Bender.
Let's look for him.

209
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:37,918
I've got a map of the ship right here.

210
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:42,113
Keep an eye on Fry.
It's possible that he did it.

211
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,029
Searching...

212
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:59,229
Why are you looking for Flexo
in my underpants?

213
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:03,718
He wasn't here 10 minutes ago,
so I thought I'd check again.

214
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:07,239
Well, he wasn't in the kitchen room.

215
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,798
Bender, can I hold that map
for a second?

216
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:15,232
And leave me high and dry in case
of a scavenger hunt? No way.

217
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,113
Give it up!

218
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:22,876
All right, take it!

219
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,710
Looks like Flexo got away clean.

220
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:30,148
It's a darn shame.

221
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:33,358
He must have jumped ship
just as we landed.

222
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:37,354
Or maybe he never left at all!

223
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,238
Wait. You're Bender.

224
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,998
Who said I wasn't?

225
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:45,079
Why were you wearing a scarf,
a turtleneck and this?

226
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:49,592
It's a little thing called style.
Look it up sometime.

227
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:05,715
Our ninth finalist,
Miss Methane Planet...

228
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:08,150
...Halatina Smogmeyer.

229
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:17,719
And our tenth and final finalist,
Miss Earth's Moon...

230
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:19,837
...the Crush-A-Nator.

231
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:26,559
Thank you, Bob Barker.
I'm as happy as a girl can be.

232
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:27,994
End statement.

233
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:33,320
Which one of these lovely womanoids
will take home the atomic tiara?

234
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:35,232
Downplay the tiara.

235
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:39,991
We'll find out after these
subliminal messages.

236
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:46,519
You lost the atom, huh?
You're garbage! Human garbage!

237
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:50,713
Do you space jockeys have any idea
how much it's worth?

238
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:52,512
- $ 100,000?
- $200,000?

239
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:56,116
- $200,001?
- You're closest without going over.

240
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:59,915
We'll leave. Just sign,
saying you received the atom.

241
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:04,199
I'm not signing squat.
Find me that damn tiara.

242
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,311
- But, Mr. Barker...
- Enough!

243
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:10,877
I may be against the fur industry,
but I'll skin you alive!

244
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:13,594
As long as no one wears the skin.

245
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:18,151
Well, gentlemen,
it appears we're boned.

246
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,479
- Flexo!
- Get him!

247
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:37,079
Next, in what is generously called
the talent competition...

248
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:40,317
...performing a traditional
gangster rap, Miss...

249
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,471
What the...?

250
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,713
Got you!

251
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:50,030
Fight! Fight! Fight!

252
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:55,349
- Shoot him, he's choking me!
- No. Shoot him, he's choking me!

253
00:17:57,320 --> 00:18:00,869
- I don't know which one to shoot!
- Shoot Flexo!

254
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:09,712
Women only room!

255
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,236
All right, enough of this!

256
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,310
There's the atom!

257
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:38,036
Bender? You stole the atom?

258
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:41,192
Yeah, but I can explain:
It's very valuable.

259
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:46,349
I saw him snatch it while Fry slept.
That's why I ran to tell Bob Barker.

260
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:49,836
Wait a second.
Bender is the evil Bender?

261
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:53,316
I am shocked! Shocked!
Well, not that shocked.

262
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:57,354
I'm sorry we suspected you, Flexo.
But with the beard...

263
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:00,273
Don't even bother!
You people sicken me!

264
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:04,029
I put my life on the line.
This is how you repay me?

265
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:07,915
You can go rot for all I care!

266
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:11,918
I'm just kidding.
You guys are all right.

267
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:14,914
I'm so confused.

268
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:19,159
The Bender I like is evil,
and the Bender I hate is good.

269
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:22,915
How can I live my life
and not tell good from evil?

270
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:26,908
They're both fine choices.
Whatever floats your boat.

271
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:30,751
- Is this the guy?
- Huh? Yeah.

272
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,274
It looks like him.

273
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,311
- Wait, but I...
- Take him away.

274
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:39,512
Let's put an end
to this pathetic hoedown.

275
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:40,988
Brannigan?

276
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,236
And the winner is...

277
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,749
Who else but Zapp Brannigan...

278
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,549
...would be judging the most
chauvinistic, degrading...

279
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:51,518
Leela?

280
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,510
Wait, you're making a...

281
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,116
Look at that!

282
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:01,714
I feel like a princess!

283
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,518
Are you people idiots?

284
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:12,309
I'm still going <i>mano a mano</i>
with this envelope.

285
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:17,029
And the winner is...

286
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,238
...Miss Vega 4!

287
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:29,953
<i>There it is...</i>

288
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:34,512
<i>... Miss Universe</i>

289
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:37,877
<i>There it is...</i>

290
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:41,516
<i>... looking weird</i>

291
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:44,031
I almost had that tiara.

292
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:45,669
Me too.

293
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:47,359
You guys are losers...

294
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:51,235
...but I made out with the woman
from the Radiator Planet.

295
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:54,318
Fry, that's a radiator.

296
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:57,950
Is there a burn ward nearby?
