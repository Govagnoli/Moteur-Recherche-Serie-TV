00:00:07,253 --> 00:00:09,323
Futurama [5x10] - The Farnsworth Paradox - CiWaN

2
00:00:32,893 --> 00:00:36,647
Oh, Lordy Lou! Help!

3
00:00:38,773 --> 00:00:41,571
I know you've rejected me a lot before,
but frankly...

4
00:00:41,733 --> 00:00:45,248
I wasn't sure we were right for
each other either. But now I am!

5
00:00:45,413 --> 00:00:49,201
So how about a date tonight?
Sorry! I think I...

6
00:00:49,373 --> 00:00:51,284
I think I left my toaster on.

7
00:00:51,453 --> 00:00:56,129
Buddha! Zeus! God!
One of you guys, do something!

8
00:00:56,333 --> 00:00:59,450
Come on, Leela. What's the real
reason you won't go out with me?

9
00:00:59,653 --> 00:01:02,326
Help, Satan! You owe me!

10
00:01:02,533 --> 00:01:06,890
Look, I'm embarrassed to admit this,
but you've forced me to.

11
00:01:07,053 --> 00:01:09,726
I can't go out tonight

12
00:01:09,893 --> 00:01:13,568
Because I have sweaty boot rash!
No spluh.

13
00:01:13,733 --> 00:01:17,931
Why do you think I'm sitting
over here in the stink-Free zone?

14
00:01:18,093 --> 00:01:19,811
So will you go out with me?

15
00:01:20,333 --> 00:01:24,531
Good news, everyone!
I'm still technically alive, yes.

16
00:01:24,693 --> 00:01:28,003
But I need you to dispose of
this crazy-Ass experiment...

17
00:01:28,173 --> 00:01:30,004
That almost killed me.

18
00:01:30,173 --> 00:01:32,562
You'll have to throw
it into the sun itself.

19
00:01:32,773 --> 00:01:35,685
For only the thermal
nuclear inferno of the sun...

20
00:01:35,853 --> 00:01:39,050
Has enough energy to ensure
its total destruction.

21
00:01:39,253 --> 00:01:41,687
I could hit it with a shovel.
That's not good enough.

22
00:01:41,893 --> 00:01:45,442
This one time I pounded a guy into
the ground like a stake with a shovel.

23
00:01:45,653 --> 00:01:48,008
Yes, yes.
So, what's in the box already?

24
00:01:48,173 --> 00:01:51,051
No peeking!
Ow! Oh! Oh! Oh!

25
00:01:51,333 --> 00:01:53,244
I don't know what's in there.

26
00:01:53,413 --> 00:01:57,167
But I'm sure our minds would
be unable to comprehend it.

27
00:01:57,373 --> 00:02:00,570
Ow! You hurt my collator!
I don't care.

28
00:02:00,733 --> 00:02:03,372
Listen well.
No matter what happens...

29
00:02:03,533 --> 00:02:08,482
No matter how great your curiosity,
you are forbidden to look in this box.

30
00:02:08,693 --> 00:02:12,811
Forbidden!
Pretty tantalizing, though.

31
00:02:13,733 --> 00:02:16,372
Whatever's in there,
it's the only thing I've ever wanted.

32
00:02:16,573 --> 00:02:19,292
In my experience boxes
are usually empty...

33
00:02:19,453 --> 00:02:21,967
Or maybe with a little
cheese stuck to the top.

34
00:02:22,133 --> 00:02:25,648
And one time, pepperoni.
What a day that was!

35
00:02:27,053 --> 00:02:28,725
Give me the box!

36
00:02:29,173 --> 00:02:31,289
Scram, you lousy green snakes!

37
00:02:33,773 --> 00:02:36,651
Here, Leela. Take this and
use it to shoot those guys.

38
00:02:36,853 --> 00:02:40,050
Right. If they try to look in the box.
Whatever.

39
00:02:40,693 --> 00:02:43,969
Let's just forget about the box.
The professor said to stay away.

40
00:02:44,133 --> 00:02:48,445
Fry, how can you be so naive?
He was joking, get it?

41
00:02:48,653 --> 00:02:52,532
No.
That's what makes it so funny!

42
00:02:54,493 --> 00:02:57,087
Okay, he wasn't joking.
Now shut up and follow me.

43
00:03:04,013 --> 00:03:06,481
Ow! It's hot!
The butter in my pocket is melting!

44
00:03:28,453 --> 00:03:30,045
Yep.

45
00:03:36,693 --> 00:03:41,164
We thank you, Bender,
for the gift we are about to receive.

46
00:03:44,133 --> 00:03:47,205
Tangled-Up Christmas lights!
We can take shifts untangling them!

47
00:03:47,413 --> 00:03:50,405
And unlabeled booze!
Wide-Mouth too!

48
00:03:54,613 --> 00:03:56,604
That ought to keep those dopes occupied.

49
00:03:57,413 --> 00:04:02,043
I can guard the real box in peace
now that no one's curious about it.

50
00:04:26,053 --> 00:04:29,125
Well, I got through the night,
and no one looked in the box.

51
00:04:29,333 --> 00:04:33,485
Not even me. The person who gave
up her whole evening to watch it.

52
00:04:33,693 --> 00:04:37,129
A whole evening of TV, gone!
What a mockery of justice

53
00:04:37,293 --> 00:04:42,162
That I can't take even a
little tiny peek. I need coffee.

54
00:04:48,213 --> 00:04:51,922
Okay, heads I look, tails I don't.

55
00:04:54,093 --> 00:04:58,325
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah!
Heads! I mean, all right, then.

56
00:04:59,893 --> 00:05:02,407
No. I have a duty not to look.

57
00:05:03,253 --> 00:05:06,165
Well, then again,
I promised the coin I would.

58
00:05:10,413 --> 00:05:13,962
Oh, it's deep.
Deeper than a small box should be.

59
00:05:17,893 --> 00:05:20,487
Ouch! My lawyer will hear about this!

60
00:05:21,813 --> 00:05:22,802
What have you done?

61
00:05:22,973 --> 00:05:25,726
Nothing! What do you mean,
why was I looking in the box?

62
00:05:25,893 --> 00:05:28,202
I meant your hair.
It's all different-Y.

63
00:05:28,373 --> 00:05:32,571
Bender? Ls--? Is that you?
You know it. Large and in charge.

64
00:05:33,173 --> 00:05:36,563
Leela? Oh, there's a woman for you.

65
00:05:36,733 --> 00:05:39,884
Always dyeing her hair instead
of not looking in a box.

66
00:05:40,093 --> 00:05:42,812
I didn't dye my hair.
This is how I always look.

67
00:05:43,013 --> 00:05:45,208
No, that's how you always look.

68
00:05:48,853 --> 00:05:52,641
This throws my entire perception
of reality into question.

69
00:05:52,853 --> 00:05:57,051
Clone? Robot? Or long-Lost twin?
Taking all bets!

70
00:05:57,253 --> 00:05:59,687
I also offer video poker!

71
00:06:03,973 --> 00:06:06,487
It's some guy wearing a Leela costume!
Get him!

72
00:06:07,053 --> 00:06:09,647
Hold it!
You have this all wrong!

73
00:06:09,853 --> 00:06:12,572
I just fell into the box
and then I fell out somehow.

74
00:06:12,773 --> 00:06:15,810
You shut up, sir!
No, wait! I've got it!

75
00:06:15,973 --> 00:06:20,125
I know what's in the box!
Oh, I've been as dumb as Fry.

76
00:06:20,333 --> 00:06:24,406
Am not!
It contains a parallel universe!

77
00:06:25,613 --> 00:06:27,888
And when you create
a parallel universe...

78
00:06:28,053 --> 00:06:31,250
It's almost always
populated by evil twins.

79
00:06:31,453 --> 00:06:34,889
Now look, I am not evil.
My loan officer said so.

80
00:06:35,093 --> 00:06:38,244
Oh, you'd like us to believe
that wouldn't you, Leela?

81
00:06:38,413 --> 00:06:40,608
Or should I say, "Evilla"?

82
00:06:40,813 --> 00:06:45,045
This is awful! Somewhere, there's
a more evil Bender than me!

83
00:06:45,213 --> 00:06:46,931
I do my best, damn it!

84
00:06:47,133 --> 00:06:49,408
Leela? The good Leela.

85
00:06:49,573 --> 00:06:51,962
I want you to snoop around
the other universe...

86
00:06:52,133 --> 00:06:54,283
And find out how evil they are.

87
00:06:55,773 --> 00:06:58,412
Here.
I tell you, they're not evil.

88
00:06:58,573 --> 00:07:00,848
But don't be confused.
They are jerks.

89
00:07:02,573 --> 00:07:03,562
Hello.

90
00:07:04,973 --> 00:07:05,962
Ow!

91
00:07:06,773 --> 00:07:09,048
Come out of your universe
with your hands up!

92
00:07:13,973 --> 00:07:16,533
Oh, wow! It's like that drug
trip I saw in that movie...

93
00:07:16,693 --> 00:07:19,253
When I was on that drug trip.
Astonishing!

94
00:07:19,413 --> 00:07:24,407
I must have created a parallel universe.
Baldercrap! I created your universe!

95
00:07:24,573 --> 00:07:29,010
All you created was my
fist parallel to your face!

96
00:07:29,173 --> 00:07:32,563
Ow.
It doesn't matter who created what.

97
00:07:32,733 --> 00:07:35,008
The important thing is--

98
00:07:36,293 --> 00:07:38,887
We're exactly the same.
I know all her moves.

99
00:07:39,053 --> 00:07:41,647
Therefore, I've got the upper hand.

100
00:07:43,333 --> 00:07:48,361
Now, now, perfectly symmetrical
violence never solved anything.

101
00:07:49,173 --> 00:07:52,483
Let's recap what's happened so far.

102
00:07:53,333 --> 00:07:57,849
As you can see, I accidentally
created a box containing your universe.

103
00:07:58,053 --> 00:08:03,525
While I, in a simultaneous blunder,
created a box containing your universe.

104
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:07,487
This is getting confusing. Why don't
we call our universe "Universe A"

105
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:12,443
And this universe "Universe B. "
Hey! Why can't we be Universe A?

106
00:08:12,613 --> 00:08:14,092
We want A!
It's the best letter!

107
00:08:14,293 --> 00:08:17,729
We called it first. Besides, this
place kind of feels like a B, you know?

108
00:08:17,933 --> 00:08:22,449
All right, you can be crummy Universe A.
And we'll be Universe One.

109
00:08:22,613 --> 00:08:26,572
Or the Mongooses. That's a cool
team name. "The Fighting Mongooses."

110
00:08:26,773 --> 00:08:29,162
Wait a second!
If everyone is identical...

111
00:08:29,333 --> 00:08:32,848
Why did our Leela look into
the box and your Leela didn't?

112
00:08:33,053 --> 00:08:37,171
Well, to be honest, I tossed a coin.
It came up tails, so I didn't look.

113
00:08:37,373 --> 00:08:40,126
That's weird.
Mine came up heads, so I did.

114
00:08:40,333 --> 00:08:44,167
Interesting. Apparently the key
difference between our universes...

115
00:08:44,333 --> 00:08:46,767
Is that coin flips
have opposite outcomes.

116
00:08:46,973 --> 00:08:51,091
That explains fruity here.
I tossed a coin to pick my finish.

117
00:08:51,253 --> 00:08:55,212
Fog hat gray.
Hey! Bite my glorious golden ass!

118
00:08:55,413 --> 00:08:59,292
You people and your slight
differences disgust me! I'm going home.

119
00:08:59,453 --> 00:09:02,490
Where's that blue box
with our universe in it?

120
00:09:02,653 --> 00:09:06,043
Oh, you'd like to get back to
your evil universe, wouldn't you?

121
00:09:06,213 --> 00:09:08,886
And destroy your box with
our universe inside it!

122
00:09:09,093 --> 00:09:11,561
Nonsense!
I would never do such a thing.

123
00:09:11,733 --> 00:09:14,611
Unless you were already
having been going to do that!

124
00:09:15,093 --> 00:09:16,811
Wha--?!
You heard me!

125
00:09:17,013 --> 00:09:20,130
In any case, I've hidden the box,
and it will remain hidden

126
00:09:20,293 --> 00:09:22,329
Until I'm convinced you're not evil.

127
00:09:22,533 --> 00:09:25,127
Everyone, keep an eye
on your evil counterpart.

128
00:09:25,293 --> 00:09:27,090
And you all do the same!

129
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:31,849
Can Fry and I watch our parallel
selves together? We have plans tonight.

130
00:09:32,053 --> 00:09:36,365
You guys are dating?
Oh, no, no. We're married.

131
00:09:43,493 --> 00:09:45,165
I got my eye on you, boy!

132
00:09:45,333 --> 00:09:49,326
Don't even think about it, lunch pail!
You'd be dead before you hit the ground.

133
00:09:49,493 --> 00:09:51,927
Good point. What do you say
we just hit a strip joint?

134
00:09:52,093 --> 00:09:54,243
I was waiting for one of us to say that!

135
00:09:56,133 --> 00:10:00,843
Bender A, you're a prince among robots.
Can you forgive me for distrusting you?

136
00:10:01,053 --> 00:10:05,922
I can't stay mad at what is
essentially me. I love me!

137
00:10:09,853 --> 00:10:14,563
This is so great!
I always wanted an imaginary friend!

138
00:10:14,733 --> 00:10:16,928
I'm not imaginary, I'm parallel.

139
00:10:17,093 --> 00:10:19,049
We're exactly the same,
right down to the--

140
00:10:19,293 --> 00:10:22,012
Is that pink nail polish?

141
00:10:22,213 --> 00:10:24,249
Is that not pink nail polish?

142
00:10:24,413 --> 00:10:28,372
The professor's right, you are evil.
And shallow.

143
00:10:28,573 --> 00:10:30,291
I am not evil!

144
00:10:33,133 --> 00:10:35,886
So, Fry, Leela, how'd
you two get together?

145
00:10:36,093 --> 00:10:39,722
Funny story. I asked Leela out a million
times, but she just kept rejecting me.

146
00:10:39,893 --> 00:10:42,885
I'd make up stuff like,
"I have sweaty boot rash" 

147
00:10:43,053 --> 00:10:45,009
Or "I have to meet the president."

148
00:10:46,293 --> 00:10:50,525
Oh, man, you never heard such excuses.
But, like a dope, I believed her.

149
00:10:50,693 --> 00:10:53,253
Looking back on it now,
it's kind of funny.

150
00:10:53,453 --> 00:10:56,889
It sure is. Right, Leela? Funny?
Ha-Ha-Ha-Ha!

151
00:10:57,093 --> 00:10:59,049
Then one night when Fry asked me out...

152
00:10:59,213 --> 00:11:01,568
The only excuse I could
think of involved ghosts.

153
00:11:01,733 --> 00:11:04,964
I knew he wouldn't buy it,
so I did what I do in those situations.

154
00:11:05,173 --> 00:11:07,164
Oh, Lord.
I flipped a coin.

155
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:09,608
It came up heads, and we went out.

156
00:11:09,813 --> 00:11:12,611
You mean you flipped a coin too?
And it was tails?

157
00:11:12,773 --> 00:11:15,048
So that's why you said
you had to meet that ghost!

158
00:11:15,253 --> 00:11:18,529
You really missed out on something,
Leela. That date was magical.

159
00:11:18,693 --> 00:11:22,288
One year later I gave Leela a
diamond scrunchy, and we were married.

160
00:11:22,533 --> 00:11:23,602
Ooh!

161
00:11:23,853 --> 00:11:26,447
One year later I got beat up
at a Neil Diamond concert...

162
00:11:26,613 --> 00:11:28,683
By a guy named Scrunchy!

163
00:11:35,373 --> 00:11:37,045
Well, that was pointless.

164
00:11:37,253 --> 00:11:39,892
Say, I hope you won't
think it "evil" of me...

165
00:11:40,053 --> 00:11:42,362
To ask how you got
that stylish head wound.

166
00:11:42,573 --> 00:11:47,567
Oh, this old thing? I was experimenting
to see if I could remove my own brain.

167
00:11:47,773 --> 00:11:50,207
Of course! I had the same idea.

168
00:11:50,373 --> 00:11:52,728
I flipped a coin to
decide if I should proceed.

169
00:11:52,893 --> 00:11:55,851
But it came up tails, so I didn't.
How'd it go?

170
00:11:56,053 --> 00:11:58,851
Well, getting the brain
out was the easy part.

171
00:11:59,013 --> 00:12:01,288
The hard part was getting the brain out.

172
00:12:02,813 --> 00:12:04,246
Oh, you!

173
00:12:06,733 --> 00:12:08,644
So tell me about yourself.

174
00:12:08,853 --> 00:12:12,812
Well, don't look into it, but I'm a
respected internal-Medicine doctor.

175
00:12:12,973 --> 00:12:14,565
A can!

176
00:12:17,013 --> 00:12:20,449
As for me, I design
mansions, then live in them.

177
00:12:21,973 --> 00:12:25,010
I'm lying. I'm an appalling failure!

178
00:12:26,373 --> 00:12:28,728
Me too! A big fat one!

179
00:12:28,893 --> 00:12:32,681
And those coworkers,
always looking down on us Zoidbergs.

180
00:12:32,853 --> 00:12:34,571
What are they, from Nob Hill?

181
00:12:34,773 --> 00:12:37,765
They're all like, "Stop spraying me
with ink, Zoidberg!"

182
00:12:37,933 --> 00:12:41,926
"Put on pants, Zoidberg!"
"Don't touch our fancy box, Zoidberg".

183
00:12:42,213 --> 00:12:45,091
Oh, that box! Too good for us, is it?

184
00:12:45,333 --> 00:12:48,643
Someday they'll watch from
down in the gutter, they will

185
00:12:48,813 --> 00:12:51,885
As King Zoidberg
caresses their fancy box!

186
00:12:52,413 --> 00:12:57,282
You know, maybe a certain blue lobster
saw where professor hid the box.

187
00:13:04,373 --> 00:13:08,161
Good news, everyones!
After carefully reading the scriptures...

188
00:13:08,373 --> 00:13:10,933
We've concluded that
none of us are evil.

189
00:13:11,133 --> 00:13:13,886
Yes, the Bible is the real good news.

190
00:13:14,053 --> 00:13:17,602
Anyhow, you're all free to
go back to your own universe.

191
00:13:18,653 --> 00:13:22,282
What's going on here? Why aren't you
all out destroying the professor's box?

192
00:13:22,493 --> 00:13:25,644
Hermes, aren't you curious
that there's two of everybody?

193
00:13:25,853 --> 00:13:30,165
No. Now, like my granny used to say
in her tarpaper shack on Montego Bay:

194
00:13:30,333 --> 00:13:32,449
"If you want a box
hurled into the sun...

195
00:13:32,613 --> 00:13:35,810
You got to do it yourself."
Your granny can go to hell!

196
00:13:35,973 --> 00:13:39,045
I've hidden the box so no one
can destroy the home universe...

197
00:13:39,213 --> 00:13:42,011
Of my handsome friend here.
Oh, go on.

198
00:13:42,213 --> 00:13:45,808
Wait a second! If your Hermes
was about to destroy the box...

199
00:13:45,973 --> 00:13:49,682
Containing our universe...
Then your Hermes...

200
00:13:49,853 --> 00:13:51,571
Oh, my.

201
00:13:51,773 --> 00:13:54,003
And sure enough....

202
00:13:55,933 --> 00:13:58,572
Like Granny said,
"If you want a box hurled into the sun...

203
00:13:58,733 --> 00:14:01,247
You got to do it yourself!"

204
00:14:01,413 --> 00:14:03,643
God rest her zombie bones.

205
00:14:06,973 --> 00:14:09,282
So we go back through
the box and stop Hermes.

206
00:14:09,493 --> 00:14:13,406
Right. Good thing Professor B
there hid it in the coelacanth tank.

207
00:14:13,573 --> 00:14:16,133
No one but a crazy
lobster would look there.

208
00:14:18,213 --> 00:14:20,010
It's gone!

209
00:14:21,333 --> 00:14:25,451
All hail Zoidberg,
the king with the box.

210
00:14:27,373 --> 00:14:31,332
Now it's my turn, maybe?
The box says no.

211
00:14:33,493 --> 00:14:38,408
Meanwhile in Universe A,
Hermes A heads towards the sun!

212
00:14:38,573 --> 00:14:39,608
A.

213
00:14:41,093 --> 00:14:42,811
Item one: box. Check.

214
00:14:43,013 --> 00:14:44,332
Item two: sun.

215
00:14:46,133 --> 00:14:48,408
That's a big check.

216
00:14:48,613 --> 00:14:50,012
Oh!

217
00:15:03,053 --> 00:15:05,806
If I know parallel Hermes,
he's at the sun by now!

218
00:15:06,013 --> 00:15:08,447
Our universe is doomed!

219
00:15:08,613 --> 00:15:11,764
Doomed!

220
00:15:11,973 --> 00:15:14,328
Now, don't give up yet, you crybabies.

221
00:15:14,493 --> 00:15:18,691
The box is gone, but we still
have one preposterously slim hope.

222
00:15:18,893 --> 00:15:21,327
Is it a kind of hair spray?
No!

223
00:15:21,493 --> 00:15:26,487
We must attempt to make another
box containing our universe.

224
00:15:38,493 --> 00:15:43,203
Well, is that your universe in there?
Nope. Too cold.

225
00:15:44,013 --> 00:15:48,609
Hmm. All women.
I'll put this one aside for later.

226
00:15:51,573 --> 00:15:55,327
It's hopeless!
We'll never find your universe in time!

227
00:15:55,493 --> 00:15:57,848
Plus, this box is stuck on my fat head!

228
00:15:58,053 --> 00:16:02,604
Yes, it's the apocalypse, all right.
I always thought I'd have a hand in it.

229
00:16:02,813 --> 00:16:06,726
I'm not sad, because I finally
found someone as great as me.

230
00:16:07,253 --> 00:16:11,132
It's like I always say,
make new friends, but keep the old.

231
00:16:11,293 --> 00:16:14,444
One is silver--
And the other's gold.

232
00:16:19,373 --> 00:16:21,250
Why with the long faces?

233
00:16:21,813 --> 00:16:25,169
The idiots have the box!
I think she means you.

234
00:16:25,373 --> 00:16:27,250
Grab them!

235
00:16:30,893 --> 00:16:33,805
You coward! Wait for me!

236
00:16:39,453 --> 00:16:42,047
Look! Which one did they go into?

237
00:16:42,253 --> 00:16:46,132
Oh, let's all ask each other!
That'll solve this problem!

238
00:16:46,293 --> 00:16:48,409
We'll each have to search a universe.

239
00:16:48,573 --> 00:16:52,725
Everyone, grab a length of wire
first so you can find your way back.

240
00:17:08,773 --> 00:17:11,492
Hello? Did you see two smelly lobsters?

241
00:17:11,653 --> 00:17:16,044
We didn't see anything. Ever.

242
00:17:19,973 --> 00:17:22,965
Yo, did two shellfish in scrubs go by?
Hell, no!

243
00:17:23,133 --> 00:17:25,852
Shut up!
Beat it, jerk!

244
00:17:29,933 --> 00:17:34,404
Have you robot versions of you guys
seen any extra Zoidbergs around here?

245
00:17:34,613 --> 00:17:38,891
Negative. Will you go out with me?
Access denied.

246
00:17:44,773 --> 00:17:48,971
Hey, pal, look what I snagged
from the Leprechaun Universe!

247
00:17:49,173 --> 00:17:54,964
Yeah, Leprechaun Universe is fine,
if you haven't seen Pirate Universe!

248
00:17:55,853 --> 00:17:57,969
Faith and begorra!

249
00:17:59,533 --> 00:18:00,522
Quis?

250
00:18:02,293 --> 00:18:03,851
Quick, into another box!

251
00:18:04,053 --> 00:18:06,726
There aren't any in this universe,
there aren't. Hey, you!

252
00:18:06,893 --> 00:18:09,771
What with the no boxes?
Baby, they're somewhere.

253
00:18:09,933 --> 00:18:14,324
Everything's, like, somewhere.
Place is kind of au naturel right now.

254
00:18:15,813 --> 00:18:17,883
There they are!
Ah!

255
00:18:18,053 --> 00:18:19,486
Gotcha!

256
00:18:19,653 --> 00:18:23,965
Dig it! All of you fitting in this
box is, like, seriously freaked up!

257
00:18:24,173 --> 00:18:27,051
Nonsense! Why, there's a
whole universe in there!

258
00:18:27,253 --> 00:18:30,484
Dude, there's a universe in all of us.

259
00:18:30,653 --> 00:18:33,645
Right on, Professor Freaksworth!

260
00:18:34,853 --> 00:18:35,968
Get a job!

261
00:18:36,853 --> 00:18:39,606
We've got the box!
Everyone, pull your wires!

262
00:18:48,373 --> 00:18:52,002
Hurry!
Back to Universe A!

263
00:19:15,693 --> 00:19:17,604
Hermes, don't press that button!

264
00:19:23,893 --> 00:19:25,087
Okay.

265
00:19:27,133 --> 00:19:29,249
Bye-Bye.
Later!

266
00:19:29,453 --> 00:19:32,411
So long, Your Majesty!

267
00:19:36,293 --> 00:19:38,853
There but for the flip of a coin go we.

268
00:19:39,413 --> 00:19:42,849
So, Leela? Seeing how the
universe wasn't destroyed...

269
00:19:43,013 --> 00:19:46,244
You wanna catch an ape fight?
You know, together?

270
00:19:46,453 --> 00:19:49,889
Well, I guess you deserve one more flip.

271
00:19:52,093 --> 00:19:57,247
So heads or tails?
You know, let's just say it's heads.

272
00:19:59,773 --> 00:20:01,491
Ready? One.

273
00:20:01,653 --> 00:20:05,487
Two. Three. Pull!

274
00:20:07,613 --> 00:20:13,370
There. That space-Time eversion has
given us their box, and vice versa.

275
00:20:13,573 --> 00:20:15,882
What you think you just
explained to us, is that--

276
00:20:16,093 --> 00:20:20,484
Correct! This box
contains our own universe!

277
00:20:21,773 --> 00:20:23,968
Sweet honeybee of infinity!

278
00:20:31,373 --> 00:20:33,568
Bender, quit destroying the universe!

279
00:20:34,533 --> 00:20:36,125
But-- Oh!

280
00:20:36,533 --> 00:20:40,811
Yes, all that is and ever
shall be is in that box.

281
00:20:41,013 --> 00:20:44,005
And the box itself is
probably worth something too.

282
00:20:44,173 --> 00:20:48,644
We must cherish it as we cherish
every moment of our lives.
