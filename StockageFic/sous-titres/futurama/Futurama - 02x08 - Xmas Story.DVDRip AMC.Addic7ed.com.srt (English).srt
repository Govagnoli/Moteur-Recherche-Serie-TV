00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:09,270
Xmas Story

2
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:34,352
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>Conan O'Brien 's head!</i>

3
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,358
Thank you. Thank you.

4
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:41,870
Let's get started. Max, play me over.

5
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:44,113
Someone forgot to feed Max!

6
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:50,479
So, people are getting pretty worried
about this Y2K problem, huh?

7
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:53,632
No! They fixed that 900 years ago!

8
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,912
Just bear with me.
I'm walking to work this morning...

9
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:58,673
I doubt it!

10
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:03,118
Listen, I may have lost my freakishly
long legs in the War of 2012...

11
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:06,193
...but I've still got something
you'll never have: A soul!

12
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:07,995
And freckles!

13
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:14,472
Well, I'm out of material.

14
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:17,069
You can catch me next week
at the Andromeda Chuckle Hut.

15
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,077
Enjoy your breakfast!

16
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:22,949
Let's face it.

17
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:28,188
Comedy's a dead art form.
Now, tragedy? That's funny.

18
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:29,475
Come on, everyone.

19
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:34,669
Perhaps skiing will help us forget
the moldy old antics of Conan O'Brien.

20
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:36,717
- Great idea!
- We can only hope.

21
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:38,995
This snow is beautiful.

22
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:41,311
I'm glad global warming
never happened.

23
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:45,075
Actually, it did. Thank God,
Nuclear Winter canceled it out.

24
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:50,154
Enough of your mindless chitchat!
Let's get going!

25
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,398
Damn it. We're stuck!

26
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:55,068
At least you're not cold-blooded.

27
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:00,316
Sweet lion of Zion,
look at the professor go!

28
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,271
Look out for those trees!

29
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:19,630
Yeah, yeah, relax. Trees down!

30
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,478
<i>Trees down!</i>

31
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:23,871
Cool. What if you want the trees up?

32
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,678
<i>Trees up!</i>

33
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:28,191
- Trees down.
<i>- Trees down.</i>

34
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,512
Looking good, meatball!

35
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:36,830
Excuse me, sir.
You're snowboarding off the trail.

36
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:40,077
Lick my frozen metal ass.

37
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,589
- Mommy!
- Help!

38
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:05,392
You, a bobsledder?
That I'd like to see.

39
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,272
Listen, you filthy crab.

40
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:11,229
1000 years ago, there was a legendary
team of Jamaican bobsledders.

41
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,475
Yep, I remember.

42
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:16,030
They came in last at the Olympics and
retired to promote alcoholic drinks.

43
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:18,674
A true inspiration for the children.

44
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,398
A little help, please?

45
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:39,914
Oh, what the hell.

46
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,069
You poor man. What happened to you?

47
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:54,108
Well, I was on the triple-diamond
slope when suddenly...

48
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,588
Oh, excuse me.

49
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,193
Hello, there.

50
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:13,675
Nothing like a warm fire
and a Super Soaker of fine cognac.

51
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:17,309
Really puts you
in the Christmas spirit.

52
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:18,959
- What-mas?
- Christmas.

53
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:21,469
You know, "X-M-A-S. "

54
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:25,878
You mean Xmas. You must be using
an archaic pronunciation.

55
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,991
Like when you say "ask"
instead of "ax. "

56
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,872
Xmas, huh?

57
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:34,275
You know, this'll be my first Xmas
away from home.

58
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,478
Let me ax you something.

59
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,518
Would it cheer you up
if we go get an Xmas tree?

60
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:42,069
Yeah! An old-fashioned Xmas tree.

61
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,910
These aren't Xmas trees!

62
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:48,516
They're like a pine tree.

63
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:52,076
Pine trees have been extinct
for 800 years, Fry.

64
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:57,070
Gone the way of the poodle
and your primitive notions of modesty.

65
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,711
Ah! Brisk.

66
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:02,115
This isn't the way Christmas
is supposed to be.

67
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:04,635
- There, there.
- Everything's changed.

68
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:06,876
That's not true.

69
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:24,911
<i>Oh Xmas tree</i>
<i>Oh Xmas tree</i>

70
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:28,675
<i>Bah boo bee boo bah bee bow</i>

71
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:35,477
Every Christmas, Mom would get a goose
for goose burgers.

72
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:40,071
Dad would whip up his special eggnog
out of bourbon and ice cubes.

73
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:44,317
This dumb holiday just makes me think
of all I left behind.

74
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:48,109
- Let's just stop talking about Xmas.
- Happy Xmas, Xmas people!

75
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:51,511
Xmas cards have arrived! Xmas!

76
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:55,036
Amy, there you go. Fry. Professor.
Zoidberg.

77
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,673
A mighty haul for Bender.

78
00:05:56,920 --> 00:06:00,276
Yes, I got the most! I win Xmas!

79
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:04,075
And last but not least,
the sweet flower of the office:

80
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:06,675
Me. Hermes Conrad.

81
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:14,358
Ah, a picture of my mommy.

82
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:15,954
Huh? What's this?

83
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:19,277
A card from my cousin Zoidfarb.

84
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:23,080
Instead of Claus, he writes "Claws. "

85
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:28,195
Now that's humorous. Today's comedians
could learn from this card.

86
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:52,113
What's the point of Xmas when everyone
you know died 1000 years ago?

87
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:54,271
I'm the Ioneliest person on Earth.

88
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,471
Leela, how about a little sympathy?

89
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,391
Yoiks! What was that about?

90
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,591
She's an orphan.

91
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:09,913
Yes. And the only one of her species
in all the known universe.

92
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,718
What a Ionely life.

93
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,476
My God, poor Leela.

94
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:20,396
Heard you needed cheering up.
Well, old Bender will make you laugh.

95
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,478
Look at me, look!

96
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:29,959
Man. I got to work on my act.

97
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,588
I feel like a rat.

98
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:39,719
I've been whining like a pig
while Leela was Ionely as a frog.

99
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:42,872
- I could kick myself.
- I'll do it for you.

100
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:46,518
- Thanks.
- You should be ashamed of yourself.

101
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:50,275
You'd have to be blind not to notice
that Leela's a Cyclops.

102
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:52,670
Fry's over there, man.

103
00:07:55,640 --> 00:08:00,668
Xmas Eve. Another pointless day
where I accomplish nothing.

104
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:05,832
<i>The holiday season is a time</i>
<i>of celebration for most.</i>

105
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:09,794
<i>But it's also a time to remember the</i>
<i>sad suffering of the less fortunate.</i>

106
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:13,874
<i>Earthlings do not yet know</i>
<i>the meaning of suffering.</i>

107
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:19,830
<i>Earlier today, I visited a shelter</i>
<i>for down-and-out robots.</i>

108
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:22,351
<i>Homeless robots, too poor to afford...</i>

109
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:25,592
<i>... even the basic alcohol they need</i>
<i>to fuel their circuits.</i>

110
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,273
<i>Is there anything sadder?</i>

111
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:30,711
<i>Only drowning puppies. And there</i>
<i>would have to be a lot of them.</i>

112
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:33,395
Where you going, Bender?

113
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:36,433
To volunteer at a liquor kitchen
for homeless robots.

114
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:39,473
Right. As if you ever did
anything charitable.

115
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:42,672
I'm very generous.
What about that time I gave blood?

116
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,075
- Whose blood?
- Some guy's.

117
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:48,312
I've got to do something to show Leela
how sorry I am.

118
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,118
So, what's the problem?

119
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:54,478
Simply get down on your claws
and do the apology dance.

120
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:59,555
So it's left, left, right...
Wait! I have a better idea.

121
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:02,269
I'll go out and get her
the perfect Xmas present.

122
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:05,478
Something so great
she'll never be unhappy again.

123
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:08,911
- Just be back by sundown, man.
- We'll see. I like to haggle.

124
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:11,754
You can't stay out on Xmas Eve.
You'll be killed!

125
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:15,589
- Say what?
- He doesn't know about Santa Claus!

126
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:18,360
I know about Santa Claus.

127
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:22,872
Back in 2801, the Friendly Robot
Company built a robotic Santa...

128
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,509
...to determine who'd been naughty
and who'd been nice...

129
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,876
...and distribute presents
accordingly.

130
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,559
But something went wrong.

131
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:32,314
Wow. 2801. Anyway...

132
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:33,873
Wait, you fool!

133
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:37,709
Due to a programming error,
Santa's standards were set too high...

134
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:40,679
...and he invariably judges everyone
to be naughty.

135
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,474
If he catches you after dark,
he'll chop off your head...

136
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:46,792
...and stuff your neck full of toys
from his sack of horrors!

137
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:51,358
Nice meeting you.

138
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:01,548
Welcome, brother. May the blessings
of the season be upon you.

139
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:06,072
I'm one of those lazy homeless bums
I've been hearing about.

140
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,675
Can you point me to the free booze?

141
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:16,875
I really like this girl but she thinks
I'm a jerk. Can you help me?

142
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:19,116
There's a suicide booth
in the Food Court.

143
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,793
Though there's a line
this time of year.

144
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,393
No, I need to get her a gift.

145
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,556
And I need it before sundown.

146
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:26,671
You can't go wrong
with something traditional.

147
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:31,670
A surface-to-Santa rocket launcher.
Comes with 3 jolly-seeking missiles.

148
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:34,838
- That's funny.
- Careful, sir.

149
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:43,913
Oh, yeah. You filthy hobos sure know
how to live.

150
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:47,675
Hey, chief? Someone's stealing
your handkerchief full of crap.

151
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:50,829
Excuse me, sir.

152
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,598
Might I have a sip of booze?

153
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:56,868
I'm sorry, Tinny Tim.
Seems we ran out early tonight.

154
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,195
I understand.

155
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:02,672
My God, that poor kid.

156
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:06,796
You're the last store open.
I need something for my friend, Leela.

157
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:16,153
- Just give me your best animal.
- Best is a matter of opinion.

158
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,277
I personally like the electric snail.

159
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:23,309
That's a stupid animal. You're stupid.
I said I want the best one.

160
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:25,869
Which costs more,
the parrot or the lizard?

161
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:28,680
The lizards are a buck each.
The parrot is $500.

162
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:31,110
That's a hell of a good parrot.

163
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:34,477
Although, I could get 500 lizards
for the same price.

164
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,153
Girls like swarms of lizards, right?

165
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:38,954
Sir, the store is closing
in 2 minutes.

166
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:41,276
Okay. I'll take the 500 lizards.

167
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:45,877
No, wait. Yes. No. Yes. Yes. Yes!

168
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,394
The parrot!

169
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:54,072
I spent every penny I had,
but I bet Leela's going to love you.

170
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:57,274
You're quite the talker,
aren't you?

171
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:59,472
Shut the hell up!

172
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:03,640
Stupid bird! I know where you live!

173
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:12,794
Hey, it's Leela!

174
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,515
Sorry I stormed out before.
I didn't mean to ruin everyone's Xmas.

175
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,312
You were gone?

176
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:21,671
I get tired of Fry always
only thinking of himself.

177
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:22,790
I hear that.

178
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:28,028
I ax him to set the table. And he goes
out to buy you a present. Selfish dog.

179
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:31,118
Wait. He's still out?
His life's in danger!

180
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,271
- Why?
- I'm telling you why.

181
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:36,278
Santa Claus is coming to town!

182
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:45,709
All right, bird.

183
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:51,114
You thought you'd beat me in a game
of wits, but you just met your equal.

184
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:14,909
Cornered!

185
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:34,514
- Hi, there.
- Leela? Oh, my God.

186
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:38,355
You saved my life.
I am going to get you so many lizards.

187
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:42,476
You didn't need to buy me a present.

188
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,676
I just wanted to make you happy.

189
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:48,470
I miss my family,
but you never even had a family.

190
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:51,114
It's okay.
You're Ionely, and I'm Ionely.

191
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:54,272
But together, we're Ionely together.

192
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:58,069
- Merry Xmas, Leela.
- Merry Xmas.

193
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:03,236
Oh, boy! It's Santa!

194
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:15,189
You've been very naughty,
Fry and Leela. I checked my list.

195
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:16,310
Well, check it twice.

196
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:18,909
I perform over 50 mega-checks
per second.

197
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:22,351
You're both naughty for disregarding
each other's feelings.

198
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:25,916
But we set things right. Fry even
risked his life to get me a present.

199
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:28,270
But what about your other co-workers?

200
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:32,837
Did either of you ever stop to think
about Doctor Zoidberg's feelings?

201
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:33,910
No, I swear!

202
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:38,591
Santa has something very special
in his sack for you.

203
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:49,198
<i>So lock the door and hit the floor</i>

204
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:51,470
<i>Because Santa Claus comes tonight</i>

205
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:54,637
- Go away.
- Whoa. Hold on.

206
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:58,071
What about the traditional glass
of hard cider?

207
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:02,069
Oh, all right. But just one glass.

208
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:11,471
Okay, that's enough.

209
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:14,872
I said, that's enough!

210
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,069
Get her purse!

211
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:30,154
Let us live! We'll put out
cookies for you!

212
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:33,079
You dare bribe Santa?

213
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:36,955
I'll shove coal so far up your
stocking, you'll cough up diamonds!

214
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:52,633
We're trapped.

215
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:56,395
I never thought it'd end this way,
gunned down by Santa Claus.

216
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:57,999
Honestly, I didn't see it coming.

217
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,473
- Goodbye, Fry.
- Goodbye, Leela.

218
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:06,674
Hey, look. We're under the mistletoe.

219
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:16,074
Your mistletoe is no match
for my T.O.W. missile.

220
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:28,398
Your present may need some assembly.

221
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:31,990
<i>On the fourth day of Xmas</i>
<i>I stole from that lady</i>

222
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:33,554
<i>Four family photos</i>

223
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:35,079
<i>Three</i> j<i>ars of pennies</i>

224
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:36,713
<i>Two former husbands</i>

225
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:40,669
<i>And a slipper on a shoe tree</i>

226
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,434
Oh, thank you!

227
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:45,915
- Help!
- Somebody help us!

228
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:48,594
It's humans!
Shall we mug them, robot, sir?

229
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:52,469
No, wait. I know these guys.
They got nothing!

230
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,870
You've been very naughty, Bender!

231
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:01,833
I didn't do nothing.
You're thinking of the kid.

232
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:04,918
My God, Bender. Framing an orphan?

233
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:09,750
That's so naughty I'll have to add it
to my list right now.

234
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:12,278
Framing...

235
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:13,989
I...

236
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,514
...N...

237
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,671
...G...

238
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:22,352
Amy, this is for you.

239
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:24,949
A set of combs
for your beautiful hair.

240
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:26,912
Oh, that's so sweet.

241
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:31,199
But I sold my hair to a wigmaker
to buy a set of combs for Hermes.

242
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,793
Oh, the irony.

243
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:36,430
I sold my hair so I could buy
this third set of combs for Zoidberg.

244
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:37,550
Thank you.

245
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,990
These'll come in handy
for my new hair.

246
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:44,118
Finally I look as pretty as I feel.

247
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:45,719
Help!

248
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:53,280
Oh, dear, they'll be killed
on our doorstep.

249
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:57,069
And there's no trash pickup
till January 3rd.

250
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:03,193
Sweet manatee of Galilee!
He's on the roof!

251
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:07,474
<i>Q</i>uick! The armor-plated chimney cover!

252
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:10,989
Push! Push!

253
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,269
Use teamwork!

254
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:21,672
Oh, dear! Oh, dear!

255
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:28,916
You've all been very naughty.
Very naughty, indeed.

256
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30,559
Except you, Doctor Zoidberg.

257
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:34,275
- This is for you.
- A pogo stick.

258
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:40,111
As for the rest of you, I'll tear off
your skin like wrapping paper...

259
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:42,794
...and deck the halls with your guts.

260
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,912
Yeah? Well, I don't believe
in Santa Claus.

261
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:50,193
Come on, everybody. If you don't
believe in him, he can't hurt you.

262
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:52,476
Oh, God, the pain!

263
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:57,469
Time to get jolly
on your naughty asses.

264
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:04,196
Watch out, his belly's shaking
like a bowl full of nitroglycerine.

265
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,389
- Rudolph's nose!
- He's going to blow!

266
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:39,790
Good thing I got us out of that one.

267
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,070
Xmas dinner, everyone.

268
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:46,318
Bender, where did you get that bird?

269
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:49,518
I found it lying in the street,
like all the food I cook.

270
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:51,671
Dig in, everyone!

271
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,230
- Thank you, sir.
- You got the toenail.

272
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:07,037
Look, the food isn't what's important.

273
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:08,229
I'm so hungry.

274
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:11,273
The important thing is,
we're all together for Xmas.

275
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:14,916
And even though I'm surrounded by
robots and monsters and old people...

276
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:17,078
...I've never felt more at home.

277
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:21,393
Hear, hear! Now, let's all of us
shut up and sing!

278
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:24,676
<i>He knows when you are sleeping</i>

279
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:27,076
<i>He knows when you're on the can</i>

280
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:31,518
<i>He'll hunt you down and blast your ass</i>
<i>From here to Pakistan</i>

281
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:34,475
<i>You'd better not breathe</i>
<i>You'd better not move</i>

282
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,790
<i>You're better off dead</i>
<i>I'm telling you, dude</i>

283
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:41,039
<i>Santa Claus is gunning you down</i>

284
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:47,270
Merry Xmas, everyone!

285
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:11,993
I'll be back.
Back when you least expect it.

286
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:15,875
Next Xmas!
