00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:09,350
Futurama [4x09] - Futurestock - CiWaN

2
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:40,512
Good thing I noticed that.

3
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:42,597
Planet Express stockholders.

4
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:48,557
I present Professor Hubert Farnsworth.
Oh!

5
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:52,189
There he is!
Take it off!

6
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:56,791
Where am I?
Move forward! Walk into the light!

7
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,471
Oh, God! I'm dead! Well, no matter.

8
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,591
Thank you all for coming.

9
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:07,878
I don't recognize any of you,
nor can I recall why I am here.

10
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:09,792
Without further ado...

11
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:14,795
A film highlighting Planet
Express, Inc.'S latest fiscal year.

12
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,879
<i>Planet Express is on the move!</i>

13
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:22,675
<i>For this hip, young delivery company,
tomorrow is today</i>

14
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:27,152
<i>And today is yesterday!
You heard me.</i>

15
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:34,479
<i>It was a year of soaring profiits
and signifiicant one-Time losses.</i>

16
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:39,749
Watching myself work makes me hungry.
Help me find food.

17
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,197
I'll not only find it,
I'll help you do more to it.

18
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:51,519
A Bot-Mitzvah!
Shalom, hunger. Shalom, free food.

19
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,875
No shellfish!

20
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:57,709
That is so unfair.
Tell me about it.

21
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:10,473
So you guys don't
believe in Robot-Jesus?

22
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:15,350
He was built and was well-Programmed,
but he wasn't our messiah.

23
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:19,153
<i>And so, our company flames onwards.</i>

24
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:23,279
<i>Planet Express: Limitless potential,
boundless horizons!</i>

25
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:28,070
<i>The unstoppable juggernaut
of the corporate universe!</i>

26
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:32,153
It's been a terrible year.
The company is on the verge of bankruptcy.

27
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:37,268
But the movie...
A substantial loss for the company.

28
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:41,155
The blue pie slice represents
the money we earned.

29
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:45,598
The green slice represents
an $8 bank error in our favor.

30
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:49,349
What about our thousands
of shares of stock?

31
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,198
Worthless.
I'll kill you!

32
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:56,349
I own one share of Planet kajiggers,
so I'm entitled to some answers.

33
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:59,836
Question: Why does no
one visit me in my home?

34
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:03,555
Your apartment smells
like Polygrip and cat pee!

35
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:07,151
This is perfect for me!

36
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:14,276
Do you have to have been
cryogenically frozen to get the free?

37
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:18,268
You didn't let me finish!
I was going to say "free food"!

38
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:25,153
My name's Joe and I'm a defrostee.
Hello, Joe!

39
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:28,158
When I was frozen,
carrots ruled the earth.

40
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:32,717
But now they don't.
It takes some getting used to.

41
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:36,597
In the 1980s,
I was the toast of Wall Street.

42
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:39,917
I had whiskey with Boesky,
cookies with Milken.

43
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:43,635
But then, I was diagnosed
with terminal bone-Itis.

44
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:47,594
Bone-Itis? That's a funny
name for a horrible disease.

45
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:50,997
There was no cure.
One drug company was close...

46
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:56,393
But I arranged a hostile takeover
and sold its assets. Made 100 mil.

47
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:04,520
I froze myself until a cure was found.

48
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:10,869
And now here I am, ready to sleaze
my way back to the top, '80s style!

49
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:15,073
As a caveman frozen in a glacier,
I face many challenges.

50
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:19,068
The hardest thing was seeing my wife
on display in the British Museum.

51
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:21,390
Oh. Yeah.

52
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:25,269
I'm from your time.
Remember that song, "Safety Dance"?

53
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:27,357
<i>Sure do. We can dance</i>

54
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:31,069
Dun-Dun-Dun-Dun-Dun-Dun-Dun-Dun-Dun
Dun-Dun-Dun-Dun

55
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:35,231
That dance wasn't that safe.

56
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:40,036
I tell you, two go-Go '80s Reaganauts
like us could rule this world!

57
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,993
Right.
If only someone would give us a shot.

58
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:48,314
They're scared of us. But if you
want a job, I could beg my company.

59
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,712
Awesome. Awesome to the max!

60
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:56,596
And finally, the post office
meter is for business mail only.

61
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,156
Come on! I've got a lot
of ransom notes to send!

62
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:02,715
Enough talk! Time for action!

63
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:05,275
I move that everyone comes over...

64
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:07,436
To snuggle my cat!
Second.

65
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:10,950
I move your cat stinks and is ugly!
Second.

66
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:15,836
I move that we vote on a new
CEO and oust this old creep!

67
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:19,999
And my cat smells good and is pretty.
Second.

68
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:23,556
Very well. I nominate the Professor!
Second!

69
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:27,270
I'm your man!
I vote my shares for the Professor.

70
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,078
The Professor!
Me!

71
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,918
I nominate that guy.

72
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:36,635
Because he knows about business
and stuff and has a tie.

73
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:41,399
Shares still count if
they were washed, right?

74
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:47,273
If I know anything about
which number is bigger...

75
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:51,678
Hold on! Scruffy votes his
40,000 shares for the stranger.

76
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:55,953
You have four times as much
stock as the rest of us?

77
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,270
Scruffy believes in this company.

78
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:06,037
It's a tie. In the event of a tie, the
Professor, as current CEO, remains...

79
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:11,268
I demand the floor! I may only have
one share, but I get to vote too!

80
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:15,393
And I'm voting against the cat-Hater!
Isn't that right, kitty?

81
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,551
Hey! You ate my change!

82
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:26,108
It's settled. The new chief executive
officer of Planet Express is...

83
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:27,878
"That Guy"!

84
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:31,669
Dun-Dun-Dun-Dun-Dun-Dun-Dun-Dun-Dun
Dun-Dun-Dun-Dun-Dun

85
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:40,313
Please welcome our new chief
executive officer, That Guy!

86
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:43,757
Yeah! Woo-Woo-Woo!

87
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:48,472
There are two kinds of people:
Sheep and sharks.

88
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:51,911
Anyone who's a sheep is fired.
Who's a sheep?

89
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:55,197
Excuse me, which one
do people like to hug?

90
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:59,359
Gutsy question. You're a shark.
Sharks don't look back...

91
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:03,036
Because they don't have necks.
Necks are for sheep.

92
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:07,152
I'm proud to shepherd
this herd of sharks...

93
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:11,678
And I am gonna lead you to
the top in this industry of...

94
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:15,668
Package delivery.
Package delivery?! Oh, God!

95
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:21,989
Fantastic! The first order of business,
blame everything on the guy before me.

96
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:25,715
Professor?
I'll ruin you like I did this company!

97
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:29,833
Terrific. Question number one:
What was your overall business plan?

98
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:36,348
Business plan? Yes. I keep it here,
right next to my heart.

99
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:43,032
This is no business plan,
it's an escape plan.

100
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:46,277
So long, suckers!

101
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:53,350
Fry, as a fellow '80s dollar jockey,
I'm making you my new vice chairman.

102
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:56,876
I'm rolling up the corporate ramp!

103
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:59,310
It's the end!
We're ruined!

104
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:04,878
What fevered dream is this that
bids to tear this company in twain?

105
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:09,434
Thank you. Come again.

106
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:13,076
That's what I call a hostile makeover.
Hair gel?

107
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:16,078
No, thanks. I make my own.

108
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:32,671
We'll shoot straight to the top
and stay there, like Cindy Lauper!

109
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:37,237
I ask you, who is the number
one delivery service on earth?

110
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:42,150
Is it Planet Express, master?
Is this guy a shark or what?

111
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:45,551
Seriously, we stink.
Here's the big enchirito.

112
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:50,234
Mom's Friendly Delivery Company.

113
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:55,275
We can't compete! Her company is big
and evil. We're small and neutral.

114
00:08:55,480 --> 00:09:00,759
Switzerland is small and neutral.
We're Germany, ambitious and misunderstood.

115
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:05,795
Everyone wants to be like Germany.
Do we have the strength of will?

116
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,278
I say we do! Will we let ourselves
get beaten by an old lady?

117
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,072
Yes, my liege.

118
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:17,957
No! I speak for the entire board
when I issue this challenge to Mom!

119
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,878
Look at my butt!

120
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:23,271
Woo! Woo, woo, woo!

121
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:27,752
You call that a pressed ham?
Walt, hit the retaliate button!

122
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:32,715
Let's see...
Any button! They all retaliate!

123
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,870
Yeah! Hit him, hit him, hit him!

124
00:09:57,080 --> 00:10:00,550
This is the high life!
Watching apes kill each other.

125
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,473
In my day, we had coke parties,
but the principle's the same.

126
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:09,719
Get your stinking trike off me,
you damn, dirty ape!

127
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:12,150
Now that you're my prot? G?

128
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:15,995
It's time I cut you in on the
secret to success. Any guesses?

129
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,720
Work really hard?
No.

130
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:22,589
Oh, thank God!
It's all about appearances.

131
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:25,718
It's time to update
our company's image...

132
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:30,750
And give it the sleek,
dazzling veneer of the 1980s!

133
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:42,513
This company's on the fast
track to the It List. Kudos!

134
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:46,429
We haven't made one delivery
since you two took over.

135
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:49,757
Delivery has nothing
to do with our business.

136
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,753
Image, people!
Scope out this new ad!

137
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:58,910
<i>We are all one. One mind.
One purpose. One act.</i>

138
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,588
<i>Our enemy shall be eaten by scorpions.</i>

139
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:05,868
<i>And we shall bow down
and worship to ourselves.</i>

140
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:09,271
<i>Ah!
We shall prevail!</i>

141
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,996
<i>Hey, we were watching that!</i>

142
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:18,348
Terrible!
People won't know what we do.

143
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:23,588
I don't know what we do. Just kidding.
What are we, a bus or something?

144
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:26,678
Did you approve that awful ad, Fry?
I did

145
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:30,111
And I'll tell you why.
It grows the brand.

146
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,514
Oh, Lord.

147
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:37,078
This company's circling the drain!
I'd sell my stock for a sandwich.

148
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,269
Sold!

149
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:44,072
A complete sandwich!

150
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:50,116
You got fleeced. I would have settled
for a hard roll with ketchup inside.

151
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:56,000
What is this moose drip?

152
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:02,559
"The New Delivery Kings"? I'm sick
of hearing about those turtle squirts!

153
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:05,911
But they're kings, Mommy.
Jam a bastard in it, you crap!

154
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:07,354
Ow!

155
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:15,552
Our private dining room. This is where
we serve our most successful chumps.

156
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,199
Tonight, that's us.

157
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:19,516
What's overpriced?
Everything.

158
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:22,877
Bring me that.
Me too. And a glass of water.

159
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:27,756
Okay, let's work on your execu-Speak.
I'm worried about "blank."

160
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:30,633
Don't worry.
Let me worry about "blank."

161
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:34,150
Good. I also would have accepted:
"Blank? Blank!

162
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:37,278
You're not looking at the big picture!"

163
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,516
What a pleasant surprise.

164
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:44,156
Shut up, booger-Blaster!
It's time we all talk.

165
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:49,474
I'll handle this, Fry. You get back
to the farm, shift some paradigms.

166
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:52,956
I'm on it. But if you need me,
you know where I'll be.

167
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:02,597
Call me a booger-Blaster!
I'll blast a booger

168
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:08,591
We're worried about Planet Express.
Don't. Let me worry about "blank."

169
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:13,476
That Guy is a con man, and you've
been hypnotized by his bologna!

170
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:16,871
You've changed, Fry.
What? I haven't changed.

171
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:19,469
<i>Suz, have I changed?
No, Mr. Fry.</i>

172
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,272
Thanks, doll.

173
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:26,474
I don't care. That Guy's turning
this place into some kind of business.

174
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:29,274
This isn't a business!
I thought of it...

175
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:33,149
As a source of cheap labor.
Like a family.

176
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:37,518
Right. We're not a traditional
family like the Murphys...

177
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:43,437
Or the lesbian coven, but we're a
family. That Guy understands that.

178
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:45,517
<i>Everyone's fiired,
and we're out of business.</i>

179
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:52,309
<i>I'm selling Planet Express to Mom.
She'll gut the company, eliminate us.</i>

180
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:55,279
<i>Don 't let the door
hit you on the way out.</i>

181
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:58,159
<i>I don 't want ass prints on my new door!</i>

182
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:11,239
Ms. Johnson, please bring
in some more chair fuel.

183
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:21,069
I had no idea the company would be
sold! I was just an innocent suck-Up!

184
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,910
Leave us alone and let
us clear out our lockers.

185
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:26,469
Yeah. Hee-Hee-Hee!

186
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:33,870
It's so sad!
Where will I go? What will I do?

187
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:36,799
You have Mrs. Darlinghaven's
cotillion at 7, ma'am.

188
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:39,793
That'll be fun.

189
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:48,155
Ms. Johnson, you've never lied to me.
Am I a good person?

190
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:51,397
<i>I don 't know.
I'm a program in the intercom.</i>

191
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:54,876
I've got to redeem myself!
Somehow, sometime

192
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:58,470
For some reason,
I'll block this takeover!

193
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:01,194
<i>Mr. Fry, your 2:00 magician is here.</i>

194
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:06,872
I have more important things to do
today than laugh and clap my hands.

195
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,354
Reschedule.

196
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:31,349
Over here! Over here!

197
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:37,230
Sell 100 soylent beans!
Buy 3000 corn bellies!

198
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:40,750
200 cans of Whoop-Ass!
Three bags of trash!

199
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:44,953
Attention. The takeover of PlanEx
by Mom's Delivery Company...

200
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:47,998
Will take place in 10 minutes.

201
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:51,550
I am Jorell, master of scheduling!

202
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:03,633
Okay. We've got the hot tub hot, the
wine coolers cool. It's Hammer time!

203
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:07,875
You suck!

204
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:12,678
By regulation, both companies
must approve the takeover.

205
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:15,792
Planet Express shareholders,
please vote.

206
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,151
Great Bonda of Uganda!
We can vote against it!

207
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:24,070
I'll vote it down like a
raise for school teachers!

208
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:35,516
What the?
Oh, no!

209
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:40,635
The shares I bought from Dr. Zoidberg
gave me majority control.

210
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:43,274
Zoidberg owned 51% of the company?

211
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:47,069
The shares were worthless!
He asked for toilet paper!

212
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:52,229
And now if MomCorp shareholders
will cast their ballots.

213
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:01,072
Um Ah

214
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,594
The ballot was confusing!

215
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:09,758
How about a hand re-Count?
Okay. Ow!

216
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:12,872
The takeover of Planet
Express is approved!

217
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:16,715
This stinks!
Madame is outraged!

218
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:20,959
Security! I want that bunch
of rowdies out of here!

219
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:23,668
Wait a minute! Hold on!

220
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:31,994
MomCorp will purchase all
shares of Planet Express...

221
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:34,834
At the current market price, which is...

222
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:36,878
<i>One hundred seven!</i>

223
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:45,280
Ow! And also it hurt my feelings!
What are you solids griping about?

224
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:48,313
Your shares are worth $107 apiece.

225
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:54,072
I'm a millionaire! Suddenly I have an
opinion about the capital gains tax!

226
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:55,713
Yeah!
I'm even richer!

227
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:58,599
I have no shares!

228
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:04,758
Wait! My sandwich! Has it also
appreciated in value? Please!

229
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:10,318
You didn't refrigerate it, spineless!
You had to drag spines into this!

230
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:18,190
<i>As vice chairman,
I'd like to say a few words.</i>

231
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:21,915
<i>A time comes for every man
that deserts his friends...</i>

232
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:25,869
<i>When he goes back how it was.
For me, that time is now.</i>

233
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:29,436
So I ask you, as a friend,
stop this deal.

234
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:32,393
I'm an '80s guy.
Friendship means for $2...

235
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:37,634
I beat you till you got detached retinas.
The deal will go ahead as...

236
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,557
My bones!
Oh!

237
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,870
Oh, my God! His bone-Itis!

238
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:53,755
I was so busy being an '80s guy,
I forgot to cure it!

239
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:00,959
My only regret is...

240
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,758
That I have...

241
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,479
Bone-Itis!

242
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,515
He's dead!

243
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:13,152
Feed him to the jackals!
Go on with the sale!

244
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:18,553
I don't think so! As vice chairman,
I gain voting control of his shares.

245
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:22,230
Don't be a fool!
I'll be whatever I want to do!

246
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:25,273
That Guy was the
greatest businessman ever.

247
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:28,870
Before his death,
he taught me everything he knew.

248
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:31,514
But some things I had to learn myself.

249
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:35,110
I learned money is fine,
but what counts is people.

250
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:37,954
You can't put a price on that.

251
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:42,273
So I'm giving control of the
company to a man of experience...

252
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,471
Professor Hubert Farnsworth!

253
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:49,668
What? I'm awake! I'm awake!

254
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:55,034
Stop doing the right thing, jerk!

255
00:19:55,240 --> 00:20:00,678
Let Mom buy it! We want to be rich!
Two out of three doesn't cut it.

256
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:03,872
You'd rather be rich than work together?

257
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,399
Hell, yeah!

258
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:10,077
This company was the only place
I ever really felt at home.

259
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:13,909
If being millionaires is more...
It is.

260
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:18,079
Important, then I'll sell
Planet Express, for you.

261
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:22,678
Millionaires nothing! The stock's
only worth three kajiggers!

262
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,359
Come on!

263
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:27,677
It's worth less now than
when it was worthless!

264
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:32,670
It is? We're poor no matter
what I do! The deal is off!

265
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:39,195
Once again, the conservative
sandwich-Heavy portfolio...

266
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:42,671
Pays off for the hungry investor!

267
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:45,632
Oh, I'm ruined!

268
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,430
Why? Why?

269
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:52,837
So we're not millionaires.
But we still get to work together.

270
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,674
Shut your fat mouth!

271
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:59,235
See you guys Monday!
