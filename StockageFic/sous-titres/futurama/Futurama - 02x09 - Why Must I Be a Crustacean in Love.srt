1
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:09,272
Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love

2
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:32,958
<i>Call Robo-Rooter if you flush a towel</i>

3
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:36,152
W<i>e also help with an impacted bowel</i>

4
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:37,919
<i>Robo-Rooter</i>

5
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,871
Now this is progress:

6
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:46,112
A self-microwaving Bavarian Cream Dog.

7
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:54,272
Let's just pray I have the energy
to get another beer.

8
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:02,478
What is this, the Middle Ages?

9
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:09,589
Look at you.

10
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,435
- You've become a fat sack of crap.
- Sack?

11
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:17,713
Bender, your beer belly's so big
your door won't close.

12
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,310
- And that doesn't make sense.
- You're coming to the gym.

13
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:24,154
The gym? Excellent! Excellent!

14
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:28,319
For some reason, I'm frisky
as a squid on Tuesday.

15
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:52,077
Who's up for a steam?

16
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:57,397
Crustaceans don't like steam.
I'll work out with the Nautilus.

17
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:02,395
- What up, Dr. Z?
- Yo, yo. What's up? Give up the rock!

18
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:06,917
Co-ed steam rooms. I love the future.

19
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:09,879
You're in the women's steam room.

20
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,548
Ah, futuristic.

21
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:15,678
Look what life was like
before genetic engineering.

22
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:18,275
The poor 20th-century women.

23
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:22,954
Hey, handsome. Have room for two?

24
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,873
You wish.

25
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:32,069
Hey, Leela, look who's the super stud.

26
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:35,477
Someone must have
turned down the gravity.

27
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:40,754
Give me that!

28
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:46,594
More weight!

29
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,469
What's that jazz on your head?

30
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:55,473
Enough questions. More weight!

31
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,588
More!

32
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:00,833
More!

33
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:05,952
Maybe you could
do more reps with less weight.

34
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:14,270
Looks like Zoidberg's finally
coming out of his shell! Get it?

35
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:15,879
He's coming out...

36
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:31,918
Nice and gentle. We don't want
any unnecessary stress.

37
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:41,830
- Is there a doctor in the gym?
- I'm a doctor!

38
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,149
Why's he acting this way?

39
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:57,671
- He seemed the most normal.
- I am normal.

40
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:02,072
Amy, take off these rubber bands
and I'll show you.

41
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:07,075
Fool me seven times, shame on you.
Fool me eight times, shame on me.

42
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,318
- Maybe he has a parasite.
- Maybe he is one.

43
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:13,160
It's sad when a friend goes nuts...

44
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,750
...and you have to have a clambake
and cook him.

45
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,198
This won't do.
Let me give old Zoidie a sedative.

46
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:26,397
- Much better. You can remove these.
- I'll do it.

47
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:28,591
- Look out!
- Moron!

48
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,112
There's the problem.

49
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:38,559
Give it to me straight. Is it fin rot?
It's fin rot, isn't it?

50
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,474
Relax, chum. It's no problem.

51
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:44,513
You're just heavy with male jelly.

52
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:46,034
Blech!

53
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,709
It's mating season for his people.

54
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:53,192
A time when his behavior
is run by the brain in his rump.

55
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:57,714
- There's one thing we can do.
- I'll boil the water.

56
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:02,476
We, I mean you, have to rush him
to his ancient home world...

57
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:06,309
...which will soon erupt in an orgy
of invertebrate sex.

58
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:10,718
- Oh, baby, I'm there!
- Do you understand "invertebrate"?

59
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:15,670
It's not the word I care about.
No need to pack pants. Let's roll!

60
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:19,072
Dr. Zoidberg said I should hold these.

61
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,549
Moron!

62
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:46,277
Welcome home, old friend!
Just 19 hours until the mating frenzy!

63
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:54,318
- Excellent! Excellent!
- See ya there, Doctor...

64
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,477
That's how you say "Zoidberg"?

65
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:01,912
You didn't have to point out
his speech impediment.

66
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:06,075
- You're looking less nuts.
- I'm feeling less nuts.

67
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:11,314
Tomorrow I'll be depositing jelly
in the cloacal vents of a female.

68
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,953
Catch my drift?

69
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:15,390
- Who's the lobsterina?
- Not sure.

70
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:19,070
I shall attract one today
with an erotic display.

71
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:22,312
Your people fall in love so fast.

72
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,670
"Love"? That word's unknown here.

73
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:29,596
I want a female swollen with eggs
to accept my genetic material.

74
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:31,154
You and me both.

75
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:35,912
Ah! My old scuttling grounds.
Let's pull over.

76
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:46,679
I used to hang out here as a larva.
It looked much bigger then.

77
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:51,673
Who's the tough guy now, Vinnie?

78
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:02,277
Look! Outdoor theater!
Let's get tickets!

79
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:04,954
It's the Ceremony of Claw Plock.

80
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:08,152
We fight to the death over honor...

81
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:12,075
...and whether abbreviations count
in Scrabble. They don't!

82
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:17,036
I didn't come to see two guys.
Where do you do your erotic display?

83
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:19,880
Same as your species. The beach!

84
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,799
- How do I look?
- Like whale barf.

85
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:29,554
Then the illusion is complete.

86
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:34,598
I wonder if they're here to watch
the erotic display too.

87
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,318
Perfect. This ought
to make me stand out.

88
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:49,311
- Look how silly they look.
- He's no different from you organisms...

89
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:52,597
...shooting DNA at each other
to make babies.

90
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:54,074
It's offensive!

91
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,669
Keep your jelly away from my eggs.

92
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:00,871
So not interested.

93
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:03,631
I've heard that before.

94
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,512
What's the point?

95
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:18,312
Why's he still alone?

96
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:22,639
He's a loser, that's why.
The lobster equivalent of Fry.

97
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:27,072
I can get any girl, any time.
I'm just too busy.

98
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,514
Edna!

99
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:39,395
Edna, it's me, Zoidberg.
Remember? From high school.

100
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:43,751
My face was covered with barnacles.

101
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:47,080
I didn't know you were back in town.

102
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:49,788
I heard you became a rich doctor.

103
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:52,679
I've performed a few mercy killings.

104
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:57,630
So, as long as I'm in town,
I was wondering if maybe, well...

105
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:03,270
Gee. Yeah, I'm just going through
a lot of things right now, and...

106
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:06,597
Look, I carry more eggs
than other females.

107
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:10,919
I owe it to our race to pick a mate
stuffed with jelly.

108
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:13,628
- Maybe a rock star.
- Or a doctor?

109
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:17,719
I'm sorry. You're just an inferior
male specimen.

110
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:20,076
Nice seeing you again.

111
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:30,397
No one will ever mate with me.
Not with a puny claw like this.

112
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:34,872
Did you see those guys?
They were giant claws with bodies.

113
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:38,078
- You didn't smell as bad.
- You're right.

114
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:41,158
My stink gland is weak. Smell!

115
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:45,198
You gotta fake like you're in love.

116
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:48,477
Look in her eyes, start crying...

117
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:51,513
...and say, "I've never been so happy. "

118
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:54,479
If a guy ever did that, I'd know it.

119
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:57,518
Wait a second. They've all done that.

120
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,432
Even Sean!

121
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:06,748
This "love" intrigues me.
Teach me to fake it!

122
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:10,154
You're on a date.
What do you do?

123
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:13,358
- Ask her to mate.
- Say she's special.

124
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:17,189
She's not. She just has
the largest clutch of eggs.

125
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:19,755
- Well, tell her that. Then?
- Then mating.

126
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:23,396
No. Make up feelings
and tell her you have them.

127
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:28,270
- Is "desire to mate" a feeling?
- You're not even trying!

128
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:33,880
It's all so complicated.
The romance and the lies upon lies.

129
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:38,477
Don't worry. The love meister
will take you under his wing.

130
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,995
Now there's a bird involved?

131
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:44,388
Okay, go ahead.

132
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,676
What the... Dr. Zoidberg?

133
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:54,429
Your display failed.
Why are you trying to talk to me?

134
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:55,789
I don't know.

135
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:58,230
You just want to talk.

136
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:01,080
I just want to talk.

137
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:03,117
That doesn't make sense.

138
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:06,392
That doesn't make sense. But okay.

139
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:08,716
Tell her she looks thin.

140
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,709
You seem malnourished.
Do you suffer from parasites?

141
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,956
Yes. Thanks for noticing.

142
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:18,152
- Ask about her day.
- Why would I care?

143
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:21,079
- You wouldn't. Ask.
- How was your day?

144
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:25,478
Well, first I got up
and had a piece of toast.

145
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:28,274
Then I went to the store. And...

146
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,551
Look, she won't shut up.

147
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:33,638
It's normal.
Just nod and say, "Uh-huh. "

148
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:37,356
- Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
- And then you threw an octopus.

149
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:41,633
It's crazy,
but when you talk this way...

150
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:45,469
...your obvious deficiencies seem
less obvious.

151
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:50,470
Your genes seem less detrimental.
You even stink more.

152
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:52,830
- Ask to mate?
- Third date.

153
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,753
So I returned his artificial heart.

154
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:01,191
Since then,
I've been called "Honest Bender. "

155
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:07,313
"I'd like to propose a toast to
coat check number 84. "

156
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:10,313
- Turn it over.
- Oh. "Edna!

157
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:14,314
Of all the gross crab monsters
on this planet...

158
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:16,590
...you are the hottest. "

159
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:17,830
Oi.

160
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:21,396
- That's the most beautiful thing.
- Yes. Well...

161
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:24,871
...excuse me. I must powder my flaps.

162
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,069
Me too.

163
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:31,114
I'm confused. I'm feeling a strange
new emotion.

164
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:34,870
Is it love when you care for a female
for reasons beyond mating?

165
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:37,515
No. Must be some alien emotion.

166
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:43,116
He said some dumb stuff.
He's a nice guy. Really.

167
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:46,909
Fry's been telling him what
to say. And Fry's a...

168
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:50,152
- Do you have idiots on your planet?
- Fry?

169
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:55,195
Words of such beauty came from
the blowhole of that hideous alien?

170
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:56,708
Yeah. What?

171
00:12:56,960 --> 00:13:02,159
Look, never mind the words.
Zoidberg's a doctor. A doctor, honey.

172
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,113
Come in.

173
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:23,834
Hello, Fry.

174
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:28,193
Can I interest you in some
surf and turf?

175
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:33,634
I came to tell you that Zoidberg's
great. He's got jelly out the wazoo.

176
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:37,117
That is where it comes out.
It's not everything.

177
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:40,153
I know Zoidberg's words were yours.

178
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:44,592
Teach me to love,
you squishy poet from beyond!

179
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:51,350
I'm flattered. If I did it
with a mudbug, you'd top the list.

180
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:56,156
Hush, you romantic fool.
Engage your mandibles and kiss me.

181
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:07,633
Edna? I couldn't stand
it any longer. I...

182
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,158
Fry!

183
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,591
It's not how it looks!

184
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:18,314
- Her caviar is on your neck!
- But...

185
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:21,916
It's true, Zoidberg.
We can't hide it any longer.

186
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:24,913
We're in love,
and we're mating tomorrow!

187
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:29,597
- What?!
- Fry! I challenge you to Claw Plock!

188
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:34,750
- English, please?
- A fight to the death!

189
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:39,429
And if you survive,
we'll make sweet love.

190
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:49,710
The law is clear.

191
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:55,159
Fry and Zoidberg shall fight
to the death for the beautiful Edna.

192
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:57,676
But I don't want her!

193
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:01,429
The tradition of Claw Plock
can't be taken back.

194
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:06,748
It is a recent tradition, only
18 years old, but it is a tradition.

195
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:22,111
I'm going to rip your swim bladder
out and show it to you!

196
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:25,830
This is madness!
You're being irrational!

197
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:29,157
Of course I'm being irrational!
I'm in love!

198
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,112
- Leela!
- Right, right.

199
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,191
You have to stop this.

200
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:35,835
Listen, lady. As you can see...

201
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:39,874
...I'm a highly desirable male
groaning with jelly.

202
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:44,198
Yet I embrace celibacy
to uphold our crazy traditions.

203
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:48,871
- One of your friends must die.
- Fate is cruel and unyielding.

204
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:51,389
And what must be, must be.

205
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:55,918
Taking bets! 9-to-2 on Zoidberg,
the crab with the jab!

206
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,958
The Great Red Hope! Come on, baby!

207
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:02,312
It's been years since medical school.
Remind me:

208
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:06,155
- Disemboweling you, fatal or not?
- Fatal.

209
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:08,715
Large bet on me in round one!

210
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:13,312
Have you anything to say
before begins the Claw Plock?

211
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:17,633
I do. Today I got up
and I had a piece of toast...

212
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:19,671
...then I brushed my teeth...

213
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:22,554
- Shut up!
- I love you, Fry!

214
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:24,273
No!

215
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:28,830
Having guessed what animal
I was thinking of...

216
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,952
...you have first choice of weapon.

217
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:42,473
- And you, doctor?
- I choose my claws.

218
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:46,315
I want to chop him here,
in the gonads.

219
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,152
Nobody correct him.

220
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:52,632
Fry, I've never asked
for anything before...

221
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:56,469
When it comes to the ninth round,
let him win.

222
00:16:56,760 --> 00:17:01,880
- It's a fight to the death!
- Suddenly it's all about you! Sheesh.

223
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:05,072
Please rise for the national anthem.

224
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:09,469
Uh-oh.

225
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:13,951
Let Claw Plock begin!

226
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:54,435
Go, Fry! Die with dignity!

227
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:58,875
Oops!

228
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:06,636
No! I can't stand to look!

229
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,473
What?

230
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:15,992
Fry! Take a dive!

231
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:21,234
Claw Plock! Claw Plock!

232
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:25,877
Claw Plock! Claw Plock! Claw Plock!

233
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:33,679
Fellow fish monsters, I don't want
to question your stupid civilization...

234
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:38,556
...but will killing someone
with a nutcracker solve anything?

235
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:43,118
He's my friend. Though a woman
has come between us...

236
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:45,151
...we'll remain friends.

237
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:48,358
And do you know why? One reason.

238
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:55,869
You bastard! I'll kill you!
You bastard!

239
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:06,911
Wait! Stop! Everyone is gone!

240
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,430
Edna? Honey?

241
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:17,109
Edna?

242
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:27,118
Oh, my God!

243
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:28,918
The frenzy!

244
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:34,359
Oh, the greatest experience
in life and I missed it.

245
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,636
I'm sorry, doc.

246
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:48,916
The frenzy is over.
How will I get rid of my jelly now?

247
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,316
- I'll lend you this.
- Fry.

248
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:54,193
- Hey!
- Shoo! Get away, hey!

249
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:57,069
What's with the flying jerks?

250
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:59,754
They feast after the frenzy.

251
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:03,396
Once my species passes
its genes, it dies.

252
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:08,277
You choose between
life without sex and death?

253
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,118
- Yes.
- Tough call.

254
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:16,152
It was nice of you
to let me fix your arm.

255
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:19,671
Especially after I made
an eel out of myself.

256
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:21,109
- No biggie.
- Yes, biggie.

257
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:24,158
I felt things I never felt before.

258
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:27,716
Love, jealousy,
passion for disemboweling.

259
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,757
I owe it all to you.

260
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:33,718
I pronounce the operation a success.

261
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,195
- Hooray!
- Yeah!

262
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:41,076
I don't know emotions.
But medicine, forget about it.

263
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:45,916
Not to nitpick, doc, but could
you take one more whack at this?

264
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:48,799
For you, my friend, anything.

265
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:52,911
<i>- My legs!</i>
<i>- All right...</i>

266
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:55,310
<i>Third time's the charm.</i>
