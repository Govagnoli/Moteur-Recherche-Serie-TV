Futurama [4x02] - A Tale Of Two Santas - CiWaN

2
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:36,398
<i>In true winter tradition, members
of the Zarlon 7 Polar Bear Club...</i>

3
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:40,394
<i>Today took the plunge into
a river of liquid ammonia.</i>

4
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:48,035
<i>There were no survivors.
It takes all kinds.</i>

5
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:53,069
<i>Now, with his annual message, here's
the head of the Xmas Safety Council:</i>

6
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:57,711
<i>The head of Walter Cronkite.
Season 's warnings.</i>

7
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:00,599
This guy's too trustworthy.
What's his angle?

8
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:04,435
<i>In all the tinsel and terror
of the holiday season...</i>

9
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:10,072
<i>We underestimate that murderous
brute known as Santa Claus.</i>

10
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:15,678
<i>With images of last year's Gingerbread
Massacre baked into our memories...</i>

11
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:20,072
<i>I remind you to bolt your doors,
say goodbye to your pets...</i>

12
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,674
<i>And lock your children
in the closet.</i>

13
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:26,628
<i>This is Walter Cronkite saying,
"I told you so."</i>

14
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:34,796
Sacred boar of Western Samoa!
We must secure for Santa's arrival!

15
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:38,393
Fine. I'm getting
tired of this wood show.

16
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,233
Cover that fireplace!

17
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:46,552
I've only a few years to live.
I don't want to spend them dead.

18
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:51,077
We're pushing as hard as we can.
Oh! Pushing.

19
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:56,152
We're doomed.
Every year we're doomed.

20
00:01:56,360 --> 00:02:00,194
Thanks be I had these
bulletproof shutters installed.

21
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:13,671
Bring it on, Santa. That vicious
cadaver-Junkie can't touch us...

22
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:17,992
As long as we're not stupid
enough to leave this building.

23
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:22,639
In a related matter,
you'll deliver this sack of letters...

24
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,270
Directly to Santa at his
death fortress on Neptune.

25
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:42,392
These letters are real butt-Nutters.
Listen to this. "Dear Santa..."

26
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,518
<i>Please, please don
't bring me any gifts.</i>

27
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:50,390
<i>The bicycle you fiired at me last year
from your bike gun tore up my insides.</i>

28
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:53,870
Awful! Let's read some more.
"Dear Santa..."

29
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:56,474
<i>Please bring me a coffiin for Grandpa.</i>

30
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:02,749
<i>You choked him with a chestnut last
year, and he's beginning to smell.</i>

31
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:09,556
In my day, Xmas was supposed to bring
people together, not blow them apart.

32
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:13,793
Sure, but who's gonna do anything
about it? Not us. No, sir.

33
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:18,875
Yes, us. We've got to bring
back the kind of Xmas I remember.

34
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:23,238
Fry's right. It's time to
sit on Santa's lap, and hard!

35
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:40,595
Look, a cute little welcoming party.

36
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:46,792
Want to buy a tiny kidney?
I'll let you punch me for a buck.

37
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:50,191
Look, we've got mail for Santa.
Are you his elves?

38
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,154
No, we're Neptunians.
We're tiny because he won't feed us.

39
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,236
You hit me. You owe me a dollar.

40
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:08,752
Got any food? Old tea bags,
chewed gum, apple cores?

41
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:12,196
We're starving here!
You live in a gingerbread house.

42
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:17,912
It's food or shelter, not both.
Don't you get paid for making toys?

43
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:20,674
Who said toys?
Toys?

44
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,148
False alarm, folks.

45
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:25,869
There's no toys made.
Santa says everyone is naughty.

46
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:31,595
That's it! I'm delivering
my boot up Santa's chimney.

47
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:35,389
Where is he?
There, in his ice fortress.

48
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:43,150
We'll need help getting in.
Any volunteers?

49
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,833
I'll help you.
Oh, phooey!

50
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,874
An omen?
Dinner.

51
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,312
Let's see who's been naughty
and who's been naughty.

52
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:25,749
Mobsters beating up a
shopkeeper for protection money.

53
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,876
Very naughty.

54
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:34,152
Shopkeepers not paying protection money.
Exactly as naughty.

55
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,439
I saw that!

56
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:41,990
Huh?
We brought your mail.

57
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,438
Don't you ever knock?

58
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:47,273
Who knows what naughty
things I could be watching?

59
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:51,672
I get New Orleans on this thing.
Don't kill us!

60
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:57,351
Santa's a robot. We should be able
to destroy him with a logical paradox.

61
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:00,956
Bender, you better cover your ears.

62
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:04,510
Holy night! Intruders!

63
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,636
Hold it, Santa.

64
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:11,915
Consider this: You are
programmed to destroy the naughty.

65
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:15,117
But many of those you
destroy are in fact nice.

66
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:20,070
I submit that you are naughty.
So, logically, you must destroy yourself.

67
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:26,432
Yay!
Yay!

68
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:33,472
Nice try, but my head was built
with paradox-Absorbing crumple zones.

69
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,917
Wait! This is what we're running from.

70
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,468
Faster! Faster!

71
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:29,554
Why aren't we moving?
I don't know.

72
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:32,712
Usually when I do stuff
like this the ship moves.

73
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,197
Ho, ho... Huh?

74
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:51,399
He's trapped.
Hooray!

75
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:56,156
Now we can make toys again!
Toys! Toys! Toys!

76
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:59,790
And I can deliver them.
Billions and billions in one night.

77
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:03,748
No human could do all that.
Evel Knievel could.

78
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,672
Nuh-Uh.
Santa's right.

79
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:08,638
We need some sort of robot.

80
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:12,190
Crap! I'm some sort of robot.

81
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,439
Hooray!

82
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,192
Hooray!

83
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,510
Hooray!

84
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:28,629
Bender can't be Santa. He wasn't
built to Yuletide specifications.

85
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:33,430
I wasn't built to steal Leela's
purse either, but that didn't stop me.

86
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:36,876
Bender!
Bow before your new Santa.

87
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:38,792
Our hero!

88
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:43,273
<i>We are free and fairly sober...
With so many toys to build...</i>

89
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:47,274
<i>The machines are kind of tricky...
Probably someone will be killed...</i>

90
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,432
<i>But we gladly work for nothing...</i>

91
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:53,952
<i>Which is good...
Because we don 't intend to pay...</i>

92
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:57,791
<i>The elves are back to work today...
Hooray...</i>

93
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:03,668
<i>We have just a couple hours...
To make several billion gifts...</i>

94
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,039
<i>And the labor isn 't easy...
Then you'll all work triple shifts...</i>

95
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:14,196
<i>You can make the job go quicker...
If you turn the controls to super speed...</i>

96
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:17,711
<i>It's back to work on Xmas Eve...
Hooray...</i>

97
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:24,469
<i>And though you're cold, sore and ugly...
Your pride will mask the pain...</i>

98
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:30,909
<i>Let my happy smile warm your hearts...
There's a toy lodged in my brain...</i>

99
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,875
<i>We are getting awfully tired...
And we can 't work any faster...</i>

100
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,519
<i>We're very, very sorry...</i>

101
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:42,391
<i>You selfiish little bastards...
The kids will think Santa is a jerk...</i>

102
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:46,712
<i>Then shut your yaps and back to work...</i>

103
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:51,429
<i>Now it's very nearly Xmas...
And we've done the best we could...</i>

104
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,478
<i>These are poorly painted...
And made from inferior wood...</i>

105
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:57,951
<i>I should give you all a beating...
But I have to fly...</i>

106
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:01,237
<i>If I weren 't stuck here...
I'd harpoon you in the eye...</i>

107
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:04,790
<i>Now it's back to our tenements...
To drown ourselves in rye...</i>

108
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,709
<i>You did the best you could...
Some of these gorillas are okay...</i>

109
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:10,239
Hooray!
We're adequate!

110
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:14,592
<i>The elves have rescued Xmas Day...
Hooray...</i>

111
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,958
Gee, how are you gonna
get through these bars?

112
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,759
I don't know, moron.
Suppose I bend them?

113
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,353
Okay.

114
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:41,554
Mommy! Santa's through the perimeter!

115
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:45,036
Kids, take your suicide
pills so you won't suffer!

116
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:50,189
No, wait! I'm the good Santa.
I've got toys at reasonable prices.

117
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:53,910
He's the father of all lies
and the uncle of all tricks!

118
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:57,237
I've come bearing Tri-Ominos.
Go for the shins!

119
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:00,272
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

120
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:07,475
One down...

121
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:18,233
Well, hello there, handsome.
Won't you have a cookie?

122
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:21,068
Don't mind if I do.

123
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,798
What's in these things?

124
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,878
Why don't you slip into
something more fiery?

125
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:29,350
Ow! Whoa!

126
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:31,590
Ow! Ah! Ah!

127
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,796
Ooh. Ow.

128
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,560
Yo, Kringle,
what happened to you, dog?

129
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:44,877
It's awful, Kwanza-Bot.
Everyone hates me.

130
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:49,632
At least they understand you.
Nobody's down with this Kwanza tip.

131
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:54,038
Hey, maybe you can lend me a hand.
No time.

132
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:56,555
I gotta hand out the Kwanza book.

133
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:02,352
I've been giving these
out for 647 years.

134
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:16,073
Bathtub eggnog,
just the way Grandma used to drink.

135
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:22,234
Ew! It went sour!
Can't I have a scented bath in peace?

136
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:27,195
Remember, professor, Bender is Santa.
So we don't need to hurt him, right?

137
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:30,557
Yes, yes, yes.
You sound like a broken MP3.

138
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:32,748
Ho, ho...

139
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:36,832
Professor, don't you
remember what I told you?

140
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,558
No!

141
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:46,109
There's gotta be a better way.

142
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:54,149
Bender, you're a genius.

143
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:58,228
This creates an unrealistic
standard of beauty.

144
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:02,632
Now it's time for Santa
to screw open his present.

145
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:07,070
It's Santa!
We've got him cornered.

146
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:12,075
I smell a juicy promotion for me.
And a juicy rehiring for me.

147
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,513
Eh? Wha...

148
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:23,830
This Xmas Day session of
court will come to order.

149
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,310
Honorable Judge Whitey presiding.

150
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:32,833
Santa, you stand accused of crimes
against humanity. How do you plead?

151
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:36,589
Not Santa.
There he is again!

152
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:42,109
Now, Pramala, I know it's
scary in the witness box.

153
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,596
But there ain't no need to fear me.

154
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:49,073
I'm sorry. I thought you was corn.

155
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:53,518
Now, would you please point
at that robot over there?

156
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,558
No further questions.

157
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:02,759
Daddy done good, huh?

158
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:09,348
Haven't you been paid to testify?
You gave me a dollar and some candy.

159
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:13,952
Yet you haven't said what I told
you to say. How can we trust you?

160
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:19,118
Quit badgering the witness.
Badger? Where?

161
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:27,034
Whereas I have a ham dinner
waiting for me at my mansion...

162
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,792
I find the defendant guilty.

163
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:35,678
Santa Claus, I hereby sentence
you to be executed at sundown.

164
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:41,278
It's not fair. I hope that dumb
chicken is ashamed of himself.

165
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:54,790
Deactivated robot walking!
Deactivated robot walking here!

166
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:02,311
Santa, when you see the robot devil,
tell him I'm coming.

167
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:06,033
That guy said to tell you...
I heard him.

168
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:19,793
Greetings, masters.
My companion and I made lots of toys.

169
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:23,999
Out of my way. We're taking
Santa to prove Bender's innocence.

170
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:32,233
Do what you will, but we'll
see who has the last ho.

171
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,955
There.
Oh, no! The ice is melting!

172
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:41,351
The factory's pollution
caused a greenhouse effect.

173
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:44,353
That would explain this heat.
And your shorts.

174
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,710
Yeah, that would explain it.

175
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:24,272
We've got to think of a way to
save Bender, or Xmas will be ruined!

176
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:26,317
Especially for Bender.

177
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:35,152
Look out, Earth.
I'm dreaming of a red Xmas.

178
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:46,194
Good old Maggie.

179
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:51,392
When I pull the switch, these
electromagnets will tear you apart.

180
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:56,270
A most humane death.
But that doesn't sound humane!

181
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:59,870
It is for the witnesses
because it's not boring.

182
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:07,558
When this random-Number generator
reaches zero, you'll be executed.

183
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:09,312
Oh.

184
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,994
"Ten. Three. Twelve. Three" again.

185
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:17,237
Stop the execution!
Leela!

186
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:18,992
"Fifteen. Negative eight."

187
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:23,039
I'll prove you've got the wrong Santa.
I'm Santa Claus!

188
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:27,676
What? "Twenty-Seven."
No, I'm Santa Claus.

189
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:30,553
"Six"!
We're also Santa Claus.

190
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:32,637
And I'm his friend, Jesus.

191
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:36,594
If you execute him,
you have to execute all of us.

192
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:40,679
You people aren't Santa.
You're not even robots. "Ninety-One."

193
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:45,595
How dare you lie in front of Jesus!
Hey, "zero"!

194
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,273
No! Not the magnet!

195
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:54,835
<i>Swing low Sweet chariot...</i>

196
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,390
<i>Coming for to carry me home...</i>

197
00:17:58,680 --> 00:17:59,715
<i>Swing low...</i>

198
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:02,639
This is horrible.
But it's not boring.

199
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,595
Ho, ho, ho.

200
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:14,600
My God! The real Santa!
Get him, Jesus!

201
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:17,559
I help those who help themselves.

202
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:22,157
Santa, you saved my life.
Please don't kill me!

203
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:29,359
I'm not here to kill you, Bender.
I need you to help me save Xmas.

204
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:35,312
Gee whiz, Santa,
you want me to help you?

205
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:39,513
Don't do it! He's evil!
I know he is, but I have no choice.

206
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:46,074
I'm late. If I don't complete my brutal
rampage, it just wouldn't be Xmas.

207
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:47,992
I guess what I'm asking is:

208
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:52,079
Bender, won't you join
my slaying tonight?

209
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:55,556
Well, 'tis the season.

210
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:18,920
My hair!
My wedding cake!

211
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:21,711
Let it snow!

212
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:26,553
Merry Xmas, kids.

213
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:38,033
This wangs chung.

214
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:41,915
After all the good we tried to do,
Xmas turned out rotten.

215
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,433
No heat.
No power.

216
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:47,309
Huddled together in fear
like lice in a burning wig.

217
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:51,115
Maybe your futuristic Xmas
isn't so rotten after all.

218
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:54,477
What are you talking about?
You said it yourself:

219
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:58,235
Xmas should bring people together,
not blow them apart.

220
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:02,991
Don't you see? Fear has brought us
together. That's the magic of Xmas.

221
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,394
That's a big crock of...

222
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,558
Hold me!

223
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:17,837
On, Trasher! On, Smasher!

224
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,072
Kwanza-Bot, where you off to?
Didn't you hear?

225
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:24,630
Chanukah Zombie is having a luau.
You coming?

226
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:26,512
Word!

227
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:33,476
Here's a small token of my appreciation
for being Santa while I was trapped.

228
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:35,830
Ooh-Whoo-Ooh-Ooh.

229
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,719
Chief, you screwed up.
There's nothing here.

230
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:42,435
Oh, it might appear empty
but the message is clear:

231
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:47,549
Play Santa again,
and I'll kill you next year!

232
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:57,037
Ho, ho, ho!
