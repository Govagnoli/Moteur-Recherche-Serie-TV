1
00:00:07,373 --> 00:00:09,443
War ls the H Word

2
00:00:34,013 --> 00:00:37,688
Spider, Hubble, Nit. . . .

3
00:00:37,933 --> 00:00:41,892
Big Pink! The gum with the
breath-freshening power of ham.

4
00:00:42,093 --> 00:00:45,449
And it pinkens your teeth
while you chew.

5
00:00:45,653 --> 00:00:49,328
All right, sergeant, $1 00 of
Pixie Stix and porno mags. . .

6
00:00:49,533 --> 00:00:53,685
. . .with your 5 percent
military discount, comes to $95.

7
00:00:55,613 --> 00:00:56,682
Forty cents.

8
00:00:56,893 --> 00:00:59,566
You forgot our
5 percent discount.

9
00:00:59,773 --> 00:01:01,286
Only for military people.

10
00:01:01,493 --> 00:01:04,724
What? This is the worst kind
of discrimination!

11
00:01:04,933 --> 00:01:07,925
-The kind against me!
-Look, our policy is. . .

12
00:01:08,173 --> 00:01:12,007
. . .if for any reason you're
not satisfied, I hate you.

13
00:01:15,293 --> 00:01:16,965
Okay, now I'm mad.

14
00:01:19,013 --> 00:01:22,369
Full price for gum?
That dog won't hunt, Monsignor.

15
00:01:26,653 --> 00:01:31,886
Hello. We're here because
we love our planet.

16
00:01:33,053 --> 00:01:36,648
Sign here, patriots.
You'll get your discount cards.

17
00:01:36,853 --> 00:01:40,812
Can we use the cards to buy gum,
then quit the Army?

18
00:01:41,013 --> 00:01:42,685
Playing you all for chumps?

19
00:01:42,893 --> 00:01:45,487
Correct. There's no obligation.

20
00:01:47,453 --> 00:01:50,172
Unless, of course, war were declared.

21
00:01:51,493 --> 00:01:54,326
-What's that?
-War were declared.

22
00:02:02,773 --> 00:02:07,369
Be careful, Fry. If you kill anyone,
make sure to eat their heart. . .

23
00:02:07,573 --> 00:02:12,089
. . .to gain their courage.
Their rich, tasty courage.

24
00:02:12,453 --> 00:02:15,331
I don't want you to worry
about your jobs.

25
00:02:15,533 --> 00:02:17,888
That's why I'm firing you now.

26
00:02:19,213 --> 00:02:22,683
I want to enlist.
They always die if I'm not there.

27
00:02:22,893 --> 00:02:25,805
Sorry.
The Army's policy is men only.

28
00:02:26,053 --> 00:02:27,884
-What?
-Shameful, I agree.

29
00:02:28,093 --> 00:02:33,884
In the old days, I proudly fought with
female troops, shoulder to shoulder.

30
00:02:34,093 --> 00:02:38,325
After some deadly blunders caused
by distracting low-cut fatigues. . .

31
00:02:38,573 --> 00:02:42,612
. . .and harmless pinching,
the Army decided women weren't fit.

32
00:02:42,853 --> 00:02:46,732
-Not when I'm in charge.
-Someone should teach you a lesson.

33
00:02:46,933 --> 00:02:51,882
If it's a lesson in love, I suffer
from a very sexy learning disability.

34
00:02:52,093 --> 00:02:55,642
-What do I call it, Kif?
-Sex-lexia.

35
00:03:05,973 --> 00:03:09,932
Men, you're lucky. Soon you'll
be fighting for your planet.

36
00:03:10,133 --> 00:03:12,169
Many of you will die for it.

37
00:03:12,373 --> 00:03:15,683
A few will be forced through
a fine mesh screen.

38
00:03:15,933 --> 00:03:17,764
They'll be the luckiest.

39
00:03:17,973 --> 00:03:22,569
-Great. We're gonna die.
-And this ham gum is all bones.

40
00:03:22,773 --> 00:03:26,448
Now, to present the logistics
of our mission. . .

41
00:03:26,653 --> 00:03:29,042
. . .welcome the original Gerber Baby. . .

42
00:03:29,253 --> 00:03:33,531
. . .Earth President Richard M. Nixon.

43
00:03:33,733 --> 00:03:36,452
This is the brass ring, fellas.

44
00:03:37,173 --> 00:03:40,165
-Planet Spheron One.
-Cool effect!

45
00:03:40,373 --> 00:03:42,364
A desolate, ugly planet. . .

46
00:03:42,613 --> 00:03:46,845
. . .with no natural resources
or strategic value. Questions?

47
00:03:47,053 --> 00:03:52,525
-Why is this planet worth dying for?
-Can't say, you're the one who'll die.

48
00:03:52,733 --> 00:03:54,803
So we'll know,
who's the enemy?

49
00:03:55,013 --> 00:03:57,686
We know nothing
about their language. . .

50
00:03:57,893 --> 00:04:01,522
. . .history, or appearance.
But we can assume this:

51
00:04:01,773 --> 00:04:04,924
They stand for everything
we don't stand for.

52
00:04:05,133 --> 00:04:07,601
Also, they said
you look like dorks!

53
00:04:07,813 --> 00:04:11,123
They look like dorks!
I'm gonna--

54
00:04:27,173 --> 00:04:30,722
What's the matter, private?
Tent got your tongue?

55
00:04:30,973 --> 00:04:35,285
Kif, write that down and send it
to Humor in Uniform.

56
00:05:07,573 --> 00:05:12,249
That guy makes Speedy Gonzales
look like Regular Gonzales.

57
00:05:15,013 --> 00:05:17,129
That recruit is phenomenal!

58
00:05:17,333 --> 00:05:20,564
Yes. He edged out my old mark
by two seconds.

59
00:05:20,773 --> 00:05:24,083
And 1 6 minutes.
And 1 2 hours.

60
00:05:24,293 --> 00:05:26,853
I do plan to finish someday, Kif.

61
00:05:27,173 --> 00:05:29,607
Good hustle, soldier.

62
00:05:29,813 --> 00:05:35,126
Sorry, sir. I was still in attack
mode. You know how testosterone is.

63
00:05:35,333 --> 00:05:38,882
As a bubbling Crock-Pot
of male hormones, I sure do.

64
00:05:39,093 --> 00:05:45,043
-What's your name, private?
-Lee, La, Man. La Man. Lemon!

65
00:05:45,253 --> 00:05:46,606
Lee Lemon, sir.

66
00:05:46,853 --> 00:05:50,004
Lemon, you're a man's man.
A man's man's man.

67
00:05:50,213 --> 00:05:53,523
More importantly, your hand,
while firm and manly. . .

68
00:05:53,733 --> 00:05:56,930
. . .is soft as a velvet child.
What's your lotion?

69
00:05:57,133 --> 00:05:58,532
Pert and Popular.

70
00:05:58,733 --> 00:06:01,964
Roger that.
Get me 1 0 cases of Pert and Popular.

71
00:06:02,173 --> 00:06:04,164
What about your Jergens?

72
00:06:04,373 --> 00:06:07,649
Squirt it on some homeless man
with dry elbows.

73
00:06:07,853 --> 00:06:12,324
Private Lee Lemon may well be
the finest recruit I've ever seen.

74
00:06:12,533 --> 00:06:14,967
That young man fills me with hope.

75
00:06:15,173 --> 00:06:19,485
And some other emotions that are weird
and deeply confusing me.

76
00:06:26,773 --> 00:06:27,808
Hello.

77
00:06:30,973 --> 00:06:33,203
Now that's a nice rosé.

78
00:06:33,413 --> 00:06:37,452
Anyway, we open up the panda crate
and the thing's dead.

79
00:06:37,653 --> 00:06:40,008
Upchucked its bamboo.
True story.

80
00:06:40,213 --> 00:06:44,331
That's whatever you were talking
about for you.

81
00:06:44,533 --> 00:06:48,526
-Mind if we sit with you?
-Why the hell would l?

82
00:06:48,773 --> 00:06:52,129
We're all guys here.
Sweaty, hairy, gassy guys.

83
00:06:52,533 --> 00:06:56,128
-Good point. I guess.
-You're my kind of soldier.

84
00:06:56,333 --> 00:07:00,929
A foul-mouthed, barrel-chested,
beer-bellied pile of ugly muscle.

85
00:07:01,133 --> 00:07:06,890
-Who's got a special lady back home?
-I have a thing for this girl at work.

86
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:11,883
Really? What type is she?
Blond, or Chinese, or Cyclops?

87
00:07:12,133 --> 00:07:15,489
-Cyclops.
-She sounds sweet.

88
00:07:15,693 --> 00:07:17,809
But sweet girls aren't for you.

89
00:07:18,013 --> 00:07:21,323
You hard-fighting, hard-farting,
ugly son of a--

90
00:07:21,533 --> 00:07:23,091
Stop flattering me!

91
00:07:23,293 --> 00:07:24,806
Ten hut!

92
00:07:25,053 --> 00:07:28,090
Well, well, well.
If it isn't Lee Lemon. . .

93
00:07:28,293 --> 00:07:31,490
. . .the flaming star
of Brannigan's Rough Rangers.

94
00:07:31,693 --> 00:07:35,652
Lemon, do you like to read?
I got a great book on tape.

95
00:07:35,853 --> 00:07:38,367
It's about life in ancient Greece.

96
00:07:39,493 --> 00:07:42,485
Sir, the alarm! I think I'd better--

97
00:07:42,733 --> 00:07:44,849
Don't talk. Just go.

98
00:07:50,093 --> 00:07:52,766
We're now in position
above Spheron One.

99
00:07:52,973 --> 00:07:56,886
This is the moment we trained
for all yesterday afternoon.

100
00:07:57,093 --> 00:08:02,884
Now, the battle plan. The key
to victory is the element of surprise.

101
00:08:03,093 --> 00:08:04,970
Surprise!

102
00:08:16,373 --> 00:08:17,567
It's creepy.

103
00:08:17,773 --> 00:08:21,163
This is the worst part.
The calm before the battle.

104
00:08:21,373 --> 00:08:26,083
-And then the battle's not so bad?
-Right, I forgot about the battle.

105
00:08:28,053 --> 00:08:31,284
-What's happening?
-Holy shoot! Look!

106
00:08:31,773 --> 00:08:34,492
The enemy! They're balls!

107
00:08:40,333 --> 00:08:44,087
-Charge your gun, Fry!
-Right.

108
00:08:47,413 --> 00:08:51,645
Watch where you're shooting, private!
You spooked Felicity.

109
00:09:01,733 --> 00:09:03,928
-Give this to my son.
-You got it!

110
00:09:04,133 --> 00:09:06,772
Wait. I didn't tell you
where he lives.

111
00:09:06,973 --> 00:09:09,726
Your son might also like those boots.

112
00:09:15,373 --> 00:09:19,889
Cover us, buddy! You got the only
wounded-up positron shooter!

113
00:09:26,893 --> 00:09:29,646
Fry, you emu-bellied coward!

114
00:09:46,213 --> 00:09:47,248
Bender, no!

115
00:09:47,453 --> 00:09:52,288
If they put me on a stamp,
tell them to use the young Bender.

116
00:10:01,053 --> 00:10:05,888
Incoming wounded! All personnel,
report to operating tent four!

117
00:10:06,093 --> 00:10:08,448
I mean, five! Repeat, four.

118
00:10:09,613 --> 00:10:11,092
Ready to operate?

119
00:10:11,293 --> 00:10:15,081
I'd love to.
But first, I have to perform surgery.

120
00:10:15,293 --> 00:10:17,602
I kid. I kid.

121
00:10:22,453 --> 00:10:23,886
Scalpel.

122
00:10:24,453 --> 00:10:25,932
Blood bucket.

123
00:10:26,333 --> 00:10:30,212
-Priest. Next patient!
-Leave some for the enemy to kill.

124
00:10:30,413 --> 00:10:33,371
Leave him alone!
He has twice your training.

125
00:10:33,573 --> 00:10:36,690
Yeah, he's a doctor and a butcher.

126
00:10:37,373 --> 00:10:41,412
This is how it starts.
First jokes, then the heavy stuff.

127
00:10:43,413 --> 00:10:45,483
When will the killing end?

128
00:10:46,013 --> 00:10:49,926
Look at this sissy. While others
fought and died pointlessly. . .

129
00:10:50,133 --> 00:10:53,808
. . .he was hiding,
wallowing in his own cowardice.

130
00:10:54,053 --> 00:10:57,125
-That wasn't cowardice.
-I'm depromoting you.

131
00:10:57,333 --> 00:11:00,131
Kif, what's the most humiliating job?

132
00:11:00,373 --> 00:11:04,525
-Being your assistant.
-Wrong! Being your assistant.

133
00:11:04,733 --> 00:11:08,169
Private, henceforth,
you'll be Kif's assistant.

134
00:11:08,373 --> 00:11:11,649
-That's not bad.
-You speak when I say so, worm!

135
00:11:11,853 --> 00:11:15,163
-I'm afraid he's gone.
-Doc, I ain't dead!

136
00:11:15,373 --> 00:11:21,243
-Excuse me, I believe I'm the doctor.
-Believing it won't make it true.

137
00:11:22,213 --> 00:11:26,126
It isn't a war. It's a murder.
It isn't war, it's murder!

138
00:11:28,333 --> 00:11:31,291
Bender, old buddy, hang in there!

139
00:11:34,253 --> 00:11:38,132
Here lies the bravest soldier
I've ever seen since me.

140
00:11:38,373 --> 00:11:42,844
I order that he be melted down
and made into a statue of himself.

141
00:11:43,053 --> 00:11:45,965
Slow down, I'm up to something here.

142
00:11:46,173 --> 00:11:50,928
I want this robot fixed. Fixed like
Kennedy fixed the 1 960 election.

143
00:11:51,133 --> 00:11:54,569
-Damn bean-eating war hero!
-Ready to operate, doc?

144
00:11:54,773 --> 00:11:58,049
I'd love to.
But first, I have to perform surgery.

145
00:11:58,253 --> 00:12:00,926
That's my joke! I'll kill you!

146
00:12:07,653 --> 00:12:09,803
Prewar scotch.

147
00:12:13,093 --> 00:12:18,884
-Welcome, lieutenant. Looking sharp.
-I got wheels! With clickity-clackers!

148
00:12:20,373 --> 00:12:24,969
Where's the little umbrella?
It's what makes a scotch on the rocks!

149
00:12:25,173 --> 00:12:26,891
Actually, sir--

150
00:12:27,093 --> 00:12:28,970
Make me a new one.

151
00:12:30,653 --> 00:12:32,769
Use a brush, you dunderhead!

152
00:12:32,973 --> 00:12:36,568
And mix these mixed nuts!
I see two almonds touching!

153
00:12:36,773 --> 00:12:40,891
Listen, this war is in danger
of going all quagmire on me.

154
00:12:41,093 --> 00:12:43,846
So I am sending you
on one last mission.

155
00:12:44,053 --> 00:12:45,611
Hot diggity daffodil!

156
00:12:45,813 --> 00:12:47,451
A mission of peace.

157
00:12:48,293 --> 00:12:51,968
You'll negotiate with their leaders,
the Brain Balls.

158
00:12:52,213 --> 00:12:55,444
They've got lots of brains
and lots of chutzpa.

159
00:12:55,653 --> 00:12:59,726
Joining you is our top peace
negotiator, Henry Kissinger.

160
00:12:59,933 --> 00:13:01,889
-How are you?
-Is he any good?

161
00:13:02,093 --> 00:13:06,291
Looking like that, he talked his way
into Jill St. John's bed.

162
00:13:17,453 --> 00:13:20,013
A little lower. Lower.

163
00:13:20,253 --> 00:13:22,403
Lower. A lot lower.

164
00:13:22,613 --> 00:13:23,648
Too low!

165
00:13:24,173 --> 00:13:25,891
Lower.

166
00:13:34,533 --> 00:13:38,731
Private Lemon! No need to leave.
My stall just became free.

167
00:13:38,933 --> 00:13:41,288
Maybe you should put on a towel.

168
00:13:41,493 --> 00:13:43,484
Right.

169
00:13:44,773 --> 00:13:47,571
I'm trying the new lotion
you recommended.

170
00:13:47,773 --> 00:13:53,086
If I accidentally put too much
on my hands, I could rub it on you. . . .

171
00:13:53,773 --> 00:13:57,482
Brannigan!
My God, cover yourself.

172
00:13:57,733 --> 00:14:02,932
I didn't live 1 000 years to look
at another man's gizmo.

173
00:14:03,133 --> 00:14:05,727
Sorry, Mr. President.
I didn't realize.

174
00:14:05,973 --> 00:14:08,123
Kif, raise him up nipple high.

175
00:14:08,333 --> 00:14:14,090
Stuff yourself into a uniform. We have
to leave before the bomb goes off.

176
00:14:14,293 --> 00:14:15,965
Bomb! What bomb?

177
00:14:16,173 --> 00:14:19,085
The doctors put it
in that gullible robot.

178
00:14:24,573 --> 00:14:27,371
Zapp! Zapp!
lnspect the troops later.

179
00:14:27,573 --> 00:14:30,690
It's time to activate the bomb.

180
00:14:33,973 --> 00:14:37,010
Now ask for economic cooperation.

181
00:14:37,213 --> 00:14:39,488
Excuse me.

182
00:14:46,893 --> 00:14:50,488
Attention! Everyone, evacuate
the planet immediately!

183
00:14:50,693 --> 00:14:52,843
Not because
it's meatloaf night.

184
00:14:53,053 --> 00:14:55,726
Come, Lemon,
before this dump blows up.

185
00:14:55,933 --> 00:14:58,686
Could you say when the bomb
is exploding?

186
00:14:58,893 --> 00:15:02,522
Sure, my significant soldier.
It's voice-activated.

187
00:15:02,733 --> 00:15:06,487
It'll detonate when the robot
speaks a certain word.

188
00:15:06,693 --> 00:15:08,365
What's the word? Sir.

189
00:15:08,573 --> 00:15:11,326
It's the one word the robot uses most.

190
00:15:11,573 --> 00:15:16,328
We got it from this database
of his 1 0 most frequently used words.

191
00:15:20,373 --> 00:15:22,125
Number 1 0: "CHUMP"

192
00:15:22,373 --> 00:15:24,091
Number 9: "CHUMPETTE"

193
00:15:24,293 --> 00:15:26,284
Number 8: "YOURS"

194
00:15:26,533 --> 00:15:28,285
Number 7: "UP"

195
00:15:28,533 --> 00:15:30,922
Number 6: "PIMPMOBILE"

196
00:15:31,133 --> 00:15:32,691
Number 5: "BITE"

197
00:15:32,893 --> 00:15:34,690
Number 4: "MY"

198
00:15:35,133 --> 00:15:37,203
Number 3: "SHINY"

199
00:15:37,453 --> 00:15:39,489
Number 2: "DAFFODIL"

200
00:15:39,693 --> 00:15:42,605
And Bender's most frequently
uttered word. . .

201
00:15:42,853 --> 00:15:45,925
. . .the word which
can destroy this planet:

202
00:15:46,493 --> 00:15:49,246
-"ASS"
-We don't have long!

203
00:15:49,733 --> 00:15:53,726
We demand bouncing,
followed by rolling of the third type.

204
00:15:53,933 --> 00:15:54,763
What?

205
00:15:55,013 --> 00:15:57,607
My chair's too hard.
It's a pain in the--

206
00:15:57,813 --> 00:16:01,726
What do you call it?
Lower back! That whole region.

207
00:16:12,933 --> 00:16:16,130
I got to break that gate,
beat up the guards. . .

208
00:16:16,333 --> 00:16:19,484
. . .steal that chopper
and rescue Bender.

209
00:16:21,173 --> 00:16:26,293
-I did it! Wait, that's not me.
-Come on! We got to save Bender!

210
00:16:26,773 --> 00:16:31,130
-You want to save him? Why?
-Fry, don't you recognize me?

211
00:16:32,173 --> 00:16:35,449
-Hermes?
-Lee, when will I see you again?

212
00:16:37,053 --> 00:16:39,123
You two are good friends?

213
00:16:39,333 --> 00:16:42,131
But I thought we would
be good friends.

214
00:16:42,333 --> 00:16:46,690
Let's see how friendly you get
when you're sharing a prison cell.

215
00:16:52,693 --> 00:16:53,682
Hey, Zapp?

216
00:16:55,533 --> 00:16:58,525
-Leela!
-So it's you I've been attracted to!

217
00:16:58,733 --> 00:17:02,282
I've never been so happy
to be beaten up by a woman.

218
00:17:02,493 --> 00:17:05,291
Let's do it again sometime.

219
00:17:06,733 --> 00:17:09,531
The elders tell
of a young ball like you.

220
00:17:09,773 --> 00:17:14,324
He bounced 3 meters in the air.
Then 1 .8 meters in the air.

221
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:19,209
Then he bounced 4 meters in the air.
Do I make myself clear?

222
00:17:19,413 --> 00:17:24,168
Mr. Ambassador,
our people tell the same story.

223
00:17:25,253 --> 00:17:27,483
These balls are making me testy!

224
00:17:27,693 --> 00:17:32,369
If they don't stop bouncing,
I'll shove this treaty up their--

225
00:17:32,573 --> 00:17:37,522
-Where do you shove things up a ball?
-Not a productive area of discussion.

226
00:17:40,933 --> 00:17:43,401
We're here.
I followed the bouncing balls.

227
00:17:43,613 --> 00:17:46,923
I'll keep a safe altitude.
You parachute down.

228
00:17:47,573 --> 00:17:52,124
My friend's life is at stake.
I can finally prove I'm not a coward.

229
00:17:53,773 --> 00:17:56,685
-Will you push me?
-I already did!

230
00:17:56,893 --> 00:17:59,088
Thank you!

231
00:18:08,373 --> 00:18:12,332
At last, war has made me into a man.

232
00:18:14,453 --> 00:18:18,002
Gentlemen, we must put an end
to the bloodshed.

233
00:18:18,213 --> 00:18:21,205
We've seen too many body bags
and ball sacks.

234
00:18:21,413 --> 00:18:24,564
We can't allow bouncing
of the seventh variety.

235
00:18:24,773 --> 00:18:28,527
No more crap! I'm catching
the next pimpmobile out!

236
00:18:28,733 --> 00:18:32,043
But before I go,
I have one thing to say.

237
00:18:32,853 --> 00:18:38,211
-Bite my shiny metal--
-Stop! You can't say the next word!

238
00:18:38,413 --> 00:18:42,008
Up yours, chump!
I said it 906 times before lunch.

239
00:18:42,213 --> 00:18:47,287
If you say the A-word, you'll blow
this planet straight to the H-word.

240
00:18:49,893 --> 00:18:52,691
Young man, you have the bravery
of a hero.

241
00:18:52,933 --> 00:18:55,891
And breath as fresh as a summer ham.

242
00:19:03,853 --> 00:19:07,084
-What's funny?
-Bender's got the upper hand now.

243
00:19:07,293 --> 00:19:12,048
The game's name is: Make Bender
Happy, or He Blows Up the Planet!

244
00:19:12,253 --> 00:19:17,532
I'd rather die and kill everybody than
sit here listening to these idiots!

245
00:19:17,773 --> 00:19:20,924
Stay calm.
No need to bounce off the handle.

246
00:19:21,173 --> 00:19:24,165
-That's it, I'll say it! A is for--
-Wait!

247
00:19:24,373 --> 00:19:29,447
Stop! We give in to all demands. The
war is over. Our home planet is yours.

248
00:19:29,653 --> 00:19:31,086
All right!

249
00:19:31,293 --> 00:19:36,413
-Wait! We're invading your planet?
-Correct.

250
00:19:36,613 --> 00:19:40,970
I guess you learned a valuable lesson.
Don't mess with Earth!

251
00:19:41,173 --> 00:19:44,848
-May you bounce in peace.
-Get the hell off my planet!

252
00:19:57,173 --> 00:20:00,131
Well, that's it.
Let's reactivate him.

253
00:20:00,333 --> 00:20:01,891
Wake up!

254
00:20:03,853 --> 00:20:06,606
Chumps and chumpettes!
ls the bomb out?

255
00:20:06,853 --> 00:20:11,324
-Can I say the word I love to say?
-Sorry, we couldn't remove it.

256
00:20:11,573 --> 00:20:14,690
It's stuck in there with glue
or something.

257
00:20:14,893 --> 00:20:19,011
Great. What's the point
of living if I can't say "ass"?

258
00:20:20,493 --> 00:20:23,530
I didn't blow up!
Ass, ass, ass, ass!

259
00:20:23,773 --> 00:20:25,968
I'm back in the saddle!

260
00:20:26,173 --> 00:20:29,051
We couldn't disarm it.
We changed the word.

261
00:20:29,253 --> 00:20:31,323
A word you almost never say.

262
00:20:31,533 --> 00:20:35,731
-That's using your ass. And the word?
-Better if you don't know.

263
00:20:35,933 --> 00:20:39,482
Come on, I'm not going to say it.
Please?

264
00:20:39,693 --> 00:20:41,331
-Is it "please"?
-No.

265
00:20:42,373 --> 00:20:48,403
-Words I never say. I know, "thanks" !
-Stop trying to destroy the world.

266
00:20:48,613 --> 00:20:52,811
Wait. Is it "sorry"?
No. "Funderful"?

267
00:20:53,053 --> 00:20:54,805
-"Nonalcoholic"?
-Quit!

268
00:20:55,053 --> 00:20:56,247
Enough already.

269
00:20:56,453 --> 00:21:00,492
"Compassion. " "Shrimp toast. "
"Antiquing"?

270
00:21:01,773 --> 00:21:03,491
I'm all right.

271
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,000
