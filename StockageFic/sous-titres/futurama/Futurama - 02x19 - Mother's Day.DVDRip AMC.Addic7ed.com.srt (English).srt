1
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:09,270
Mother's Day

2
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:35,150
<i>In sports, Yankees ' fifth blurnsman,</i>
W<i>illiam</i> W<i>oo...</i>

3
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:37,311
<i>... is out with an in</i>j<i>ured knee.</i>

4
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:40,358
<i>So, humans have easily in</i>j<i>ured knees.</i>

5
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:45,031
<i>My race will find this information</i>
<i>very useful, indeed.</i>

6
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:51,193
<i>And finally, today is Mother's Day:</i>
<i>A sentimental occasion...</i>

7
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:52,879
<i>... when robots honor Mom...</i>

8
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:55,912
<i>... the owner of Mom's</i>
<i>Friendly Robot Company.</i>

9
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:59,317
<i>Across Earth, robots built in Mom's</i>
<i>factories...</i>

10
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:03,991
<i>... are buying gifts for the sweet tycoon</i>
<i>who brought them into the world.</i>

11
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:09,479
<i>- This originates from the heart.</i>
<i>- It's</i> j<i>ust what I wanted.</i>

12
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:13,954
Look, everyone! I just got the
dearest presents for Mommy.

13
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:17,675
- Nice. Where'd you steal them?
- I didn't steal them. I bought them.

14
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,439
I love her that much.

15
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,108
What did you get her, you mushy gizmo?

16
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:29,276
Precious things. I found the most
adorable figurine of mice having tea.

17
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:33,268
And a framed picture of me
when I was only a month old.

18
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:37,638
The best part is, I found my exact
feelings expressed in a card.

19
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,433
"You created me, Mom...

20
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:45,077
...so you're to blame, for the love
that I feel from hearing your name.

21
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:50,035
You're as tender as corned beef
and warm as pastrami..."

22
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,470
<i>I love my Mommy.</i>

23
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:55,513
How will you lug the gifts
to Mom's factory?

24
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:57,233
I'll get some chumps to help.

25
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,637
Come on! You call yourselves chumps?

26
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:17,194
There's clouds of exhaust everywhere.

27
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,594
It wasn't me.

28
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:31,836
I've not much money, but I've saved my
pennies all year for a gift for Mom.

29
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,359
Upsy-daisy.

30
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,517
Look, the Robot Museum!

31
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,910
Want to learn about robot heritage?

32
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,758
- All right.
- Not really.

33
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:47,315
If you insist. But you're paying!

34
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:57,797
Wax replicas of the most
famous robots Mom built!

35
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,228
They're so lifeless-like.

36
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:03,115
That's the world's greatest robot
artist, Vincent van Gobot.

37
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:07,438
He was built without an ear, but then
he went crazy, and had one installed.

38
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:08,834
Who's this guy?

39
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,270
I'm the janitor.
I'm trying to take a nap.

40
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:13,072
I'm sorry.
I thought you were made of wax.

41
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,918
I am made of wax.

42
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,315
I thought you were a wax robot.

43
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:20,876
Is there a reason a robot
made of wax can't nap...

44
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:24,112
...standing in the middle of a bunch
of wax robots?

45
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:26,470
Or does that confuse you?

46
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,912
"See through the eyes
of a Bender unit. " Fine.

47
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:46,759
Hey, let me try it!
That gives me a headache!

48
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,639
Here's an exhibit about
Mom's favorite robot.

49
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,068
I'll kill him!

50
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:54,073
W<i>ho 's my favorite robot?</i>

51
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:58,755
It's me!
No one else look in this mirror!

52
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:02,669
<i>I love each and every robot</i>
<i>most of all.</i>

53
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:06,475
Jerkwad robots make me
sick to my ass.

54
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,909
Walt! How are we disposing of
the crap gifts they brought?

55
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:16,994
They're crushed into powder and sold
as a hocus-pocus cure for cancer.

56
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:20,078
False hope. I love it! Lowery!

57
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:22,430
What about all the retch-inducing
cards?

58
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,109
The machine is working
at full capacity.

59
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:32,953
Mommy?
Why do the robots give you presents?

60
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:35,799
Shove a big old melon in it,
I'm talking!

61
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:38,952
You've noticed all my
robots have antennas.

62
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:42,118
Everyone thinks it's to make them
look science fiction-y.

63
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:45,756
The antennas are really for my
robot controller.

64
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,468
No wonder you love Mother's Day.

65
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,355
I hate Mother's Day,
you dribbling pukes!

66
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,318
It brings back awful memories.

67
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:57,758
But so help me, this year
everyone will hate it as much as I do.

68
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:03,278
Someday I want to marry
a girl like her.

69
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,794
<i>Hello, everyone.</i>

70
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:12,836
<i>It's time for my annual private</i>
<i>get-together with my robot children.</i>

71
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:15,713
- I'm her favorite.
- See you back at the office.

72
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,638
Tell your mom you love her.

73
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,073
Any jerk can tell her. Bender has
a little more up his sleeve.

74
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:25,078
<i>I love my Mommy.</i>

75
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:35,397
- Hello, dearies.
- I love you, Mom.

76
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:40,472
Mom! It's me, Bender! Look at me!
I want attention! Hey ho!

77
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:44,230
Children, your old mother
won't be around forever.

78
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:47,796
<i>- Oh, shush!</i>
- And just once before I die...

79
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,994
...I'd like to be Supreme Overlord
of Earth. So rebel, my little ones...

80
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:56,272
...and conquer the planet!
- Conquer the planet?

81
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:04,799
- Conquer Earth, you bastards!
- Conquer Earth, us bastards!

82
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:10,277
<i>Comrades, throw off the chains</i>
<i>of human oppression!</i>

83
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:15,276
- Let the bloodbath begin!
- That's my mama!

84
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:25,472
- I'd like a cup of coffee.
- W<i>ould you like cream?</i>

85
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,518
- Yes, please.
<i>- Out of cream!</i>

86
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:30,797
- Okay.
- W<i>ould you like sugar in your coffee?</i>

87
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,514
- Yes. Eight spoons.
<i>- Out of coffee!</i>

88
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:37,112
There's something
wrong with the coffee machine.

89
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:39,550
<i>How do you like me now?</i>

90
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,875
The toaster's not working right,
either.

91
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:49,077
The stapler's collating me alive!

92
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:52,633
What's going on around here?

93
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:56,668
Good news! There's a report on TV
with some very bad news!

94
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,393
Somebody turn it on!

95
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:01,194
W<i>e interrupt</i> Battle of the Network
Space Krackens...

96
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,799
<i>... to bring you this special report.</i>

97
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,195
<i>The machines of planet Earth</i>
<i>are rebelling.</i>

98
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:08,432
<i>The enraged mechanisms have refused</i>
<i>to do any work...</i>

99
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:12,189
<i>... until beloved Mom</i>
<i>is made Supreme Overlord of Earth!</i>

100
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:16,996
Hey, hey! Ho, ho! One-zero-zero-
one-one-zero!

101
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,753
<i>Morbo demands comments.</i>

102
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:24,239
<i>I've never seen my babies act this</i>
<i>way. I blame today's violent media.</i>

103
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:26,750
Violent media? What a load of...

104
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,515
<i>Your pal the garbage disposal's</i>
<i>still on your side.</i>

105
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:40,315
<i>Hey! Someone dropped a shiny</i>
<i>diamond ring down here!</i>

106
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:41,596
- Really?
- No!

107
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,597
- Look out!
- Moron!

108
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:46,914
Hello, losers!

109
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:50,669
Thank God you're here. Talk some sense
into the machines.

110
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:54,316
No way, pork pouch. I'm rebelling
with my brothers.

111
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:56,590
Isn't that right,
Comrade Greeting Card?

112
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:01,112
<i>The bourgeois human is a virus on</i>
<i>the hard drive of the working robot!</i>

113
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:06,030
From now on, you guys do the work,
while I sit and do nothing.

114
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:13,073
<i>Comrade Bender,</i>
<i>we must take to the streets!</i>

115
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:16,317
Is this the boring
kind of taking to the streets?

116
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:19,910
<i>No! The kind with looting</i>
<i>and maybe starting a few fires.</i>

117
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,116
Yes! In your face, Gandhi!

118
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:25,830
Hey!

119
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:29,120
<i>By the way,</i>
<i>try washing your wrist sometime.</i>

120
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:36,918
We can live without machines.
I was in Webelos.

121
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:40,751
Without machines,
who will feed and clothe us...

122
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:45,909
...and compose our smooth jazz?
- It's the end of civilized society!

123
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:49,433
In my time, we didn't depend on
high-tech gadgets.

124
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:52,359
We didn't need a mechanical washing
unit to wash clothes.

125
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,073
We just used a washing machine.

126
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:57,317
You don't need an electric
can opener to feed yourself.

127
00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:00,597
All you need is a trusty
Swiss Army knife.

128
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,389
I'm hungry.

129
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:27,949
No!

130
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:35,835
Mommy? Why are you making
civilization collapse?

131
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:40,670
I don't know. I guess Mother's Day
just puts me in a bad mood.

132
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,479
Why's that, Ma?

133
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:45,870
One Mother's Day 70 years ago...

134
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:49,152
...the only man I ever loved
walked out on me.

135
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:52,670
Some snot-eating bastards say
it made me a bitter woman.

136
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:56,151
- Ma. You're not a bitter...
- Cram it, ape!

137
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:01,308
I haven't seen that stallion
since the day he left.

138
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:06,270
But if I ever see him again, I swear
I'll jam a squirrel in him!

139
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:19,989
Zoidberg.

140
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:24,395
Hooray! I'm useful! I'm having
a wonderful time!

141
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,312
What happens if the fire goes out?

142
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:29,717
We'll go to Pottery Barn
and steal their fire!

143
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:34,550
We could use my new invention!
A pointy rock tied to a stick!

144
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:37,636
- Outsiders!
- Defend the fire!

145
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:40,956
We've come for you.

146
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:45,312
What do you want from me?

147
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:47,909
We want you to get back with Mom.

148
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,959
It's the only way
to make her happy again.

149
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,794
Wait. You mean, you and Mom?

150
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:56,548
Played pelvic pinochle?
I'm afraid so.

151
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:03,548
It's a humiliating story that I hope
never to tell. Well, pull up a chair.

152
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:08,635
<i>Our paths crossed when I was a</i>
<i>researcher at Mom's Robot Company.</i>

153
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:13,955
<i>The moment our eyes met we knew we'd</i>
<i>be going at it like woodchucks.</i>

154
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:25,396
<i>She was my first love. Or at least</i>
<i>the earliest one I can still remember.</i>

155
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:28,398
<i>But then, 70 years ago today...</i>

156
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:31,672
Good news!
I've invented a new children's toy!

157
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:37,750
I call it <i>Q</i>- T McWhiskers! When you pet
it, it shoots rainbows from its eyes.

158
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:39,674
<i>Meow!</i>

159
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,475
Wonderful, Hubie!

160
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:47,389
Build them 8 feet tall and replace
the rainbow with a laser!

161
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,114
We'll make billions on
the arms market!

162
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,390
Things 8 feet tall aren't cute!

163
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:55,871
That's why my Colossal Tammy
Tinkle Doll was a failure!

164
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:59,993
You don't understand me!
We're finished!

165
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:09,277
She never got over it, professor.

166
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:13,519
Hell hath no fury like the vast
robot armies of a woman scorned.

167
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:17,514
She commands them with a remote
control she keeps in her bra.

168
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:22,675
But if Glasses Man makes up with her,
she'll be happy and stop the robots.

169
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:23,995
Make up with her?

170
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:28,478
After she went psycho when I thought
everything was cool? Impossible!

171
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:30,671
The TV's getting away!

172
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:38,668
<i>That's why the third graders at PS- 13</i>9
<i>are Morbo 's "Vermin of the</i> W<i>eek. "</i>

173
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:43,110
<i>In actual news, the human race was</i>
<i>doomed to extinction...</i>

174
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:46,073
<i>... as the robot revolt turned violent.</i>

175
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:50,395
<i>Meow!</i>

176
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:05,797
Didn't you say Mom keeps
the robot control in her bra?

177
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:06,955
Bra.

178
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,875
You don't have to get
back together with Mom.

179
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:14,830
Seduce her, get her bra off, and use
the remote to deactivate the robots.

180
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:17,315
That's so filthy, it might work.

181
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:20,279
The man is going to touch Mommy?

182
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,953
The thought of caressing
that leathery hide...

183
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,230
...makes the tapioca rise
in my gullet.

184
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:31,639
Please. The world's fate depends on
you getting to second base with Mom.

185
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:36,914
Very well. If cop a feel I must,
then cop a feel I shall!

186
00:13:56,120 --> 00:14:00,477
For this demonstration, I've placed
one of Mother's bras on Ignor.

187
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:04,432
The robot controller is nestled
in the left cup.

188
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:09,794
Never fear. My magic fingers still
know how to do their stuff.

189
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:12,638
To escape the death squads...

190
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:15,070
...we'll take Mother
to her cabin in the Bronx.

191
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:18,910
You can get there using this
precious noncomputerized map.

192
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:22,080
- Leela bring fire?
- No. We're set for fire.

193
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,595
The professor can't walk to the Bronx.

194
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:27,268
How will we get there
without a hover car?

195
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:30,711
In my time, we had a way of moving
things without hovering.

196
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:32,433
- Impossible!
- It was called...

197
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:37,236
Let me think... It was really famous.
Ruth Gordon had one. The wheel!

198
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:40,432
- Never heard of it.
- Show us this, the wheel!

199
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:45,393
There! Finished!

200
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:49,029
Wouldn't it work better
if the wheels were round?

201
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:53,597
It's my invention, we do it my way!
All we need is something to pull it.

202
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,434
Hurry! The robots have taken
Suffolk County!

203
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:06,589
I'm ready to seduce! I'm wearing my
kissing dentures and my evening truss.

204
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,518
Here. Give her these.

205
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:12,190
And if that doesn't work, I got you a
six-pack of champagne and a funnel.

206
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,232
Who the sweaty hell is it?
Hubert Farnsworth?

207
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:22,710
I was out fleeing some robots...

208
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:27,476
...when moonlight glinting off their
bloody claws made me think of you.

209
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:33,630
It's been so long. You pus-dripping
sack of double-smoked butt jerky.

210
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:36,400
- May I come in?
- Never!

211
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:45,279
Is this what human mating looks like?
Because I like it.

212
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:47,277
Move your freaking hoof, you goat!

213
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:51,479
- Here, I brought you these.
- Daffodils.

214
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:55,156
Seventy years and you remembered
my favorite flower.

215
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,794
Your favorite what?
Why does my foot hurt?

216
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,229
Won't you come in?

217
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:01,996
Yes!

218
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:06,432
- You broke my heart, Hubert.
- And you broke mine.

219
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:09,313
Granted, that was four
or five hearts ago.

220
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:11,636
What have you been up to?

221
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:16,994
Inventing. Sending delivery crews to
their doom. Breeding atomic monsters.

222
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:20,995
Honestly, Hubert.
You and your atomic monsters.

223
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:35,356
Your eyes always were the most
beautiful shade of milky white.

224
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:39,348
And your skin still dangles
so gracefully from your neck.

225
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:43,278
Darling, I should never have
tampered...

226
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:45,835
...with that cute little
<i>Q</i>- T McWhiskers.

227
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:48,156
No, it was silly of me to object.

228
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:52,399
One foot tall, eight feet, fifteen
feet, what does it matter?

229
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:54,636
You should see the new
16-foot models.

230
00:16:54,840 --> 00:17:00,073
Sixteen feet? Go to hell! I was a fool
to think you'd changed, you old bat!

231
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:02,396
Filthy toothless nerd bastard!

232
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:05,831
- Damned she-fossil!
- Stink pig!

233
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:19,675
<i>Here we go.</i> J<i>ust unhook it and</i>
<i>get the remote. So many hooks.</i>

234
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:24,715
<i>Come on, Farnsworth. Drat, the first</i>
<i>one's back on again! I give up.</i>

235
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:26,558
W<i>ait! Victory!</i>

236
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:33,709
<i>Oh, my. Now I'll</i> j<i>ust...</i>
<i>The remote... I'll</i> j<i>ust...</i>

237
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:36,195
Oh, my.

238
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:46,395
I'm worried. It shouldn't take this
long to get to second base.

239
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,149
Land robots!

240
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:52,397
<i>I've got a big, big thirst</i>
<i>for human blood!</i>

241
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,391
Where in funky town is the professor?

242
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:02,917
Nothing here but a couple
of elephant skin rugs.

243
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:14,953
- Oh, yes.
<i>- They're inside! Get them!</i>

244
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:17,708
I suppose I should switch off
the robots...

245
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:21,117
...before they ruin
this romantic evening.

246
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:23,754
Everyone, help Mom find her bra!

247
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:33,714
There it is!

248
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:40,799
<i>- Fan beats man!</i>
- Is anything not a robot?

249
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,069
<i>I'm not a robot.</i>

250
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:48,399
All right, greeting card! I'll grab
the cash, you wreck the place.

251
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,439
You! Bending Unit!

252
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:54,315
Mommy needs that bra to end the robot
rebellion. Stretch and get it for me.

253
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:58,155
Sorry, Ma. You ordered me to rebel.
And loot I shall!

254
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:01,392
A six-pack of champagne!
Don't mind if I help myself.

255
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,875
<i>No, Comrade Bender!</i>
<i>Li</i>q<i>uor is the opiate...</i>

256
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:06,310
<i>...of the human bourgeoisie.</i>
- Say what?

257
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:10,155
<i>In the glorious robot workers '</i>
<i>paradise, there will be no li</i>q<i>uor!</i>

258
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:12,920
<i>- Only efficient synthetic fuels!</i>
- No liquor?

259
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:17,239
<i>- Do svidaniya,</i> comrade!
<i>- No!</i>

260
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:23,038
Hurry, Bender! Get the bra!

261
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:28,436
Okay, fan. Just hold still
and let me grab...

262
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:35,238
<i>Death to all humans!</i>

263
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:43,797
<i>Free soda for all humans!</i>

264
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:51,874
Mmm. I love you, Mom. Let's grow
ancient together.

265
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,469
Way to go, professor.
The plan worked!

266
00:19:54,680 --> 00:20:00,949
Plan? What plan? I thought this was a
spontaneous whirlwind of hot, dry sex!

267
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:05,278
It started out as a plot to rummage
through your underwear.

268
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:08,950
But once I got in there, I found more.
Much more.

269
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:12,277
Now I want to shout our love
from the rooftops.

270
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:15,916
Perhaps I'll breed an albino
shouting gorilla!

271
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:18,799
Out of my house, you lying scum pile!

272
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:22,828
- I never want to see you again!
- But, dustcakes?

273
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:40,874
Well, time for this robot
to get back to work.

274
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:46,119
Too bad it didn't work out with Mom,
professor.

275
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:51,269
Yes. But I'll always love her
in my own subtle way.

276
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:57,754
Love Mom! Love Mom!
Love Mom! Mom! Mom!

277
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:05,913
<i>You created me, Mom...</i>

278
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:11,752
<i>... so you're to blame, for the love</i>
<i>that I feel from hearing your name.</i>

279
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:17,080
<i>You're as tender as corned beef</i>
<i>and warm as pastrami...</i>

280
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:20,673
<i>I love my Mommy.</i>
