1
00:00:07,293 --> 00:00:09,409
Time Keeps On Slipping

2
00:00:35,173 --> 00:00:36,731
Go get it, boy.

3
00:00:40,333 --> 00:00:43,769
How about a romantic ride
in one of those swan boats?

4
00:00:43,933 --> 00:00:46,572
They're dangerous,
but I've mastered them.

5
00:00:46,773 --> 00:00:49,731
Those aren't swan boats.
They're swans.

6
00:00:49,973 --> 00:00:53,010
That explains these boat eggs.

7
00:01:19,693 --> 00:01:21,809
Pitiful ballplayers of Earth...

8
00:01:22,013 --> 00:01:27,246
...I am Ethan "Bubblegum" Tate,
commander of the Harlem Globetrotters.

9
00:01:28,733 --> 00:01:33,363
For generations, your planet has lived
in peace with our home world.

10
00:01:33,573 --> 00:01:35,803
But now, for no reason...

11
00:01:36,053 --> 00:01:40,968
...we challenge you to defend
your honor on the basketball court.

12
00:01:41,173 --> 00:01:46,201
Will no one meet our challenge?
Have none of you Earthlings game?

13
00:01:46,413 --> 00:01:50,884
- What happens if we lose?
- Nothing. There's nothing at stake...

14
00:01:51,093 --> 00:01:53,402
...beyond the shame of defeat.

15
00:01:58,373 --> 00:02:00,762
This will not stand.

16
00:02:01,373 --> 00:02:04,763
I'll take you on,
you air-balling bozos.

17
00:02:04,973 --> 00:02:10,889
You, old man? Sweet Clyde,
laugh derisively at him.

18
00:02:13,493 --> 00:02:17,281
I may be an old man...
In fact, I'm fairly sure I am...

19
00:02:17,493 --> 00:02:20,485
...but I'll put you
Globetrotters in your place...

20
00:02:20,693 --> 00:02:23,526
...with my team of mutant
atomic supermen!

21
00:02:27,293 --> 00:02:31,172
Behold! My mutant atomic supermen.

22
00:02:33,693 --> 00:02:37,208
- They're only a foot high.
- They're still young.

23
00:02:37,453 --> 00:02:39,648
Mere atomic superboys, really.

24
00:02:39,853 --> 00:02:44,449
We'll speed up their growth with
time particles called Cronotons.

25
00:02:44,653 --> 00:02:48,532
- Those destroyed an entire civili...
- Good news, everyone.

26
00:02:48,693 --> 00:02:52,003
You're off to the Tempest Nebula
to gather Cronotons.

27
00:03:07,613 --> 00:03:10,491
Hey, Leela, look at me.

28
00:03:15,093 --> 00:03:17,926
Your face can take a lot of punishment.
Good to know.

29
00:03:18,133 --> 00:03:22,684
There's a lot about my face you don't
know. You and it should get acquainted.

30
00:03:22,893 --> 00:03:26,966
- Cool your jets, hotshot.
- Why won't you go out with me?

31
00:03:27,173 --> 00:03:30,529
- We both know there's something there.
- No, I mean, cool your jets...

32
00:03:30,773 --> 00:03:33,890
...they're melting Bender's face.

33
00:03:38,493 --> 00:03:41,690
- Here you go. Hot off the nebula.
- None too soon.

34
00:03:41,933 --> 00:03:47,291
The Trotters held a news conference
to announce that I was a jive sucker.

35
00:04:09,773 --> 00:04:13,448
Behold! My invincible nuclear mutants.

36
00:04:13,773 --> 00:04:15,331
- Hi.
- Hello.

37
00:04:16,733 --> 00:04:19,725
Marv Albert here at
Madison Cube Garden...

38
00:04:19,933 --> 00:04:23,164
...where the Globetrotters take on a
squad of atomic supermen...

39
00:04:23,373 --> 00:04:28,367
...in what should be a by-the-numbers
contest with no surprises whatsoever.

40
00:04:30,493 --> 00:04:32,529
Here's the tip-off. Globetrotter ball.

41
00:04:32,773 --> 00:04:36,322
Clyde Dixon to Bubblegum Tate.
Drives downcourt...

42
00:04:36,533 --> 00:04:38,922
...and Curly Joe from the rear.

43
00:04:39,173 --> 00:04:42,006
- That one grabbed his behindus.
- Quiet!

44
00:04:42,213 --> 00:04:44,773
Who dares laugh at
the Jesters of Dunk?

45
00:04:44,973 --> 00:04:49,489
We came to terrify and humiliate you,
not tickle your funny bones.

46
00:04:49,693 --> 00:04:56,007
Watch as I embarrass your civilization
by passing the ball to Curly Joe.

47
00:04:56,293 --> 00:05:00,923
Only to have it remain
in my hands with elastic.

48
00:05:01,973 --> 00:05:03,964
Boo!

49
00:05:04,173 --> 00:05:08,724
And perhaps this will wipe
the smiles from your faces.

50
00:05:09,173 --> 00:05:10,401
Goose goes up.

51
00:05:11,053 --> 00:05:15,171
Rejected. Agrow-treant
from half court. Yes!

52
00:05:17,133 --> 00:05:18,851
GLOBETROTTERS - 42
SUPERMEN - 45

53
00:05:19,053 --> 00:05:21,408
Supermen lead 45-42.

54
00:05:21,653 --> 00:05:25,692
Aracneon with the steal.
Thorais from downtown.

55
00:05:26,173 --> 00:05:31,201
Yes! He's showing us what a man
with a cannon in his chest can do.

56
00:05:31,413 --> 00:05:35,292
No showboating, you atomic hotdog.

57
00:05:37,533 --> 00:05:42,812
And that's the half, with the Supermen
up 48-42. Surprisingly dull so far.

58
00:05:49,093 --> 00:05:52,085
The Trotters are down by six.
Reactions?

59
00:05:52,333 --> 00:05:57,407
We planned to trail at the half, thus
deepening Earth's eventual humiliation.

60
00:05:57,573 --> 00:06:00,212
Also, what game
were the refs watching?

61
00:06:04,293 --> 00:06:09,003
Curly Joe, easily amused by his own
antics, continues to wreak havoc on...

62
00:06:10,173 --> 00:06:11,891
- What the...?
- What happened?

63
00:06:12,093 --> 00:06:13,287
What was that?

64
00:06:13,533 --> 00:06:18,448
Did everything just jump around?
Or did my brain just stroke off there?

65
00:06:18,653 --> 00:06:21,884
Something very strange
has just happened...

66
00:06:22,093 --> 00:06:25,802
...in this game between space clowns
and atomic monsters.

67
00:06:34,093 --> 00:06:35,572
Time-out. Time-out.

68
00:06:36,933 --> 00:06:40,528
- What's happening?
- We're lurching forward in time...

69
00:06:40,693 --> 00:06:42,923
...like a needle skipping
on a record.

70
00:06:43,133 --> 00:06:45,886
- What's causing it? Is it my outfit?
- No.

71
00:06:46,053 --> 00:06:50,205
It must have something to do
with those time particles I used.

72
00:06:50,573 --> 00:06:53,770
Time and space are ripping apart
at the seams.

73
00:06:56,733 --> 00:06:58,325
- Oops.
- Oh, great.

74
00:06:58,573 --> 00:07:02,532
Now, on top of everything,
we need a new fifth man.

75
00:07:02,773 --> 00:07:05,446
Put me in. I wanna show Leela
my skills.

76
00:07:06,453 --> 00:07:09,206
- Will said skills pay the bills?
- Who cares?

77
00:07:09,373 --> 00:07:14,288
We're 35 points ahead with two
minutes left. What could possibly...?

78
00:07:18,133 --> 00:07:23,412
Globetrotters win, 244-86.
A dark day for humanity, folks.

79
00:07:23,573 --> 00:07:27,327
We have been beaten in basketball.

80
00:07:27,533 --> 00:07:30,331
- Yeah, that's how we do it.
- How's that?

81
00:07:30,493 --> 00:07:33,132
You are all fools
of the highest caliber.

82
00:07:33,333 --> 00:07:36,405
I don't know what you did, Fry,
but you screwed up.

83
00:07:36,613 --> 00:07:39,810
Now all the planets are gonna
crack wise about our mamas.

84
00:07:39,973 --> 00:07:45,730
- I'm glad my fat mama isn't alive.
- Enough about your promiscuous mom...

85
00:07:45,973 --> 00:07:50,330
...we have bigger problems.
This time disruption is serious.

86
00:07:50,573 --> 00:07:51,801
Damn right, man.

87
00:07:52,013 --> 00:07:55,801
This chronological wang-dang-doodle
could destroy the matrix of reality.

88
00:07:56,093 --> 00:07:59,768
- Tate, what do you know about this?
- Not much yet...

89
00:07:59,973 --> 00:08:04,489
...but I am senior lecturer in physics
at Globetrotter U. I'd like to help.

90
00:08:04,693 --> 00:08:09,813
- You're that Bubblegum Tate?
- I sure ain't his grandma. Look here.

91
00:08:10,053 --> 00:08:14,046
We got an excess of Cronotons
in the subatomic interstices.

92
00:08:14,253 --> 00:08:15,925
Yes, I see.

93
00:08:16,093 --> 00:08:20,928
Something involving that many big
words could destabilize time itself.

94
00:08:21,133 --> 00:08:22,930
- Is that a problem?
- Indeed.

95
00:08:23,093 --> 00:08:27,211
At this rate, by Tuesday it'll be
Thursday. By Wednesday it'll be August.

96
00:08:27,453 --> 00:08:31,810
And by Thursday, it will be the end
of existence as we know it.

97
00:08:31,973 --> 00:08:37,889
I have to ask you to clear out. The
circus needs to set up for tomorrow's...

98
00:08:44,853 --> 00:08:47,413
<i>Time continues to skip forward
randomly.</i>

99
00:08:47,573 --> 00:08:50,292
<i>Details at 1 1...
This is the news at 1 1.</i>

100
00:08:50,493 --> 00:08:53,690
<i>The unexplained...
Turning to entertainment news...</i>

101
00:08:53,933 --> 00:08:58,404
<i>... teen singer Wendy might be the...
Won three Grammys last night...</i>

102
00:08:58,573 --> 00:09:02,009
<i>- Found dead in her bathtub.
- Interesting.</i>

103
00:09:02,173 --> 00:09:06,849
We behave normally during the time
skips, but we have no memory of it.

104
00:09:07,053 --> 00:09:10,728
- You mean we just...
- My, yes. Just like that.

105
00:09:10,973 --> 00:09:13,282
- Any luck, Bubblegum?
- Not yet.

106
00:09:13,533 --> 00:09:19,642
- Hope you don't mind if I dribble.
- Not if you grant me the same liberty.

107
00:09:20,533 --> 00:09:25,084
Bubblegum, I'm a huge fan of your
work, both on and off the court.

108
00:09:25,333 --> 00:09:29,087
- Can I be a Globetrotter?
- Shut up, turkey.

109
00:09:29,333 --> 00:09:34,487
Bubblegum, look. The background
time radiation is fluctuating wildly.

110
00:09:36,253 --> 00:09:38,892
That sucker's shaking like fine booty.

111
00:09:39,053 --> 00:09:45,083
I'm no physicist, but I think I know
how to stop the skipping. We'll just...

112
00:09:46,813 --> 00:09:48,849
I don't know how this was
supposed to work.

113
00:09:49,053 --> 00:09:52,489
I hope you find out what's
wrong before we skip my birthd...

114
00:09:52,773 --> 00:09:56,607
- Happy birthday, Amy.
- Hooray, look at all these presents.

115
00:09:56,853 --> 00:10:02,689
I hope we all have as much fun
tomorrow at my birth... What?

116
00:10:05,933 --> 00:10:08,731
I've set up a time-proof shelter
in the closet.

117
00:10:08,893 --> 00:10:11,407
You're the one I want
to share it with.

118
00:10:11,613 --> 00:10:14,252
Fry, that's so sweet. Let me see.

119
00:10:18,493 --> 00:10:21,291
How will this protect us
from time jumps?

120
00:10:21,453 --> 00:10:26,766
Because when we're together in here,
baby, time will stand still.

121
00:10:34,053 --> 00:10:38,569
- Zoidberg, can I talk to you about Fry?
- Leela, I would be honored.

122
00:10:38,853 --> 00:10:43,290
- does the worst W.C. Fields
imitation I've ever seen. Zoidberg?

123
00:10:43,493 --> 00:10:46,132
Sorry, you must have been boring me.

124
00:10:46,333 --> 00:10:50,406
The thing is, Fry is very sweet.
But he's so immature.

125
00:10:50,573 --> 00:10:54,043
I love his boyish charm,
but I hate his childishness.

126
00:10:54,253 --> 00:11:00,601
So he's not perfect. You don't wanna
end up old and lonely like Zoidberg!

127
00:11:03,053 --> 00:11:04,281
You were saying?

128
00:11:07,133 --> 00:11:13,083
There it is. The Tempest Nebula.
Take a whiff through the Smell-a-Scope.

129
00:11:14,573 --> 00:11:18,486
- What's that funky jazz?
- The odor of pure time leaking.

130
00:11:18,653 --> 00:11:22,407
When we removed the Cronotons,
it destabilized the nebula...

131
00:11:22,573 --> 00:11:25,610
...causing time skips
throughout the universe.

132
00:11:25,773 --> 00:11:30,449
- Let Bubblegum tell it.
- Pretend these balls are time particles.

133
00:11:30,653 --> 00:11:33,884
As the nebula bounce-passes
them off us...

134
00:11:34,133 --> 00:11:38,843
...they cause dents, or "time skips."
- You are so smart.

135
00:11:39,053 --> 00:11:44,127
What if we were to move this star
cluster to these algebraic coordinates?

136
00:11:44,333 --> 00:11:49,771
Their gravity may divert the Cronotons
to the empty side of the universe.

137
00:11:49,933 --> 00:11:51,332
But is it possible?

138
00:11:51,573 --> 00:11:54,531
Moving stars requires
a bad-ass gravity pump.

139
00:11:54,693 --> 00:11:57,730
We'd need all the money
on Earth to build...

140
00:12:01,133 --> 00:12:06,048
Here's funding. It better work. We can't
spend all of Earth's money every day.

141
00:12:06,253 --> 00:12:09,723
- How long will it take to build?
- It won't be easy.

142
00:12:09,973 --> 00:12:13,329
A jim-jam this complex might
take months or even...

143
00:12:13,573 --> 00:12:15,882
There we are. One gravity pump.

144
00:12:16,093 --> 00:12:19,130
Powerful enough to move
the stars themselves.

145
00:12:19,293 --> 00:12:22,888
Now to begin the arduous task
of attaching it to the ship...

146
00:12:25,413 --> 00:12:27,131
Off you go, apparently.

147
00:12:33,053 --> 00:12:37,569
Easy, Leela. Just finger-roll
that star to the cosmic basket.

148
00:12:37,813 --> 00:12:40,008
Just a few more...

149
00:12:40,253 --> 00:12:44,565
...hundred thousand miles.

150
00:12:44,773 --> 00:12:46,445
There.

151
00:12:49,773 --> 00:12:51,809
Nothing but nebula.

152
00:12:52,093 --> 00:12:55,927
I think we've stopped the time skips.

153
00:12:56,093 --> 00:12:58,084
- All right.
- Hooray for Leela.

154
00:12:58,253 --> 00:13:01,768
What better way to celebrate
than by showing Bubblegum...

155
00:13:01,933 --> 00:13:04,242
...the Globetrotter uniform I made.

156
00:13:04,453 --> 00:13:06,569
Let me see.

157
00:13:07,013 --> 00:13:08,287
Hello, lawsuit.

158
00:13:08,493 --> 00:13:13,613
I want you to know I think the way
you moved those stars was wonderful.

159
00:13:13,853 --> 00:13:15,252
I got you something.

160
00:13:16,293 --> 00:13:20,332
Moderately priced, non-vintage
champagne? How did you know?

161
00:13:20,533 --> 00:13:25,402
You deserve it. Nobody ever stops to
tell you what a great captain you are.

162
00:13:25,573 --> 00:13:27,450
That is so true and sweet.

163
00:13:27,653 --> 00:13:31,851
You're smart, beautiful, and best
of all, you'll go out with me?

164
00:13:32,133 --> 00:13:34,772
Fry, please try to understand.

165
00:13:34,973 --> 00:13:38,204
You're a man. I'm a woman.
We're too different.

166
00:13:38,373 --> 00:13:42,889
Bubblegum might let me organize a bake
sale for the Globetrotter wives.

167
00:13:43,053 --> 00:13:48,127
- Can you teach me to make cupcakes?
- All right. I want to lick the beaters.

168
00:13:48,333 --> 00:13:51,882
I got her champagne.
What does a guy have to do?

169
00:13:52,133 --> 00:13:54,124
Eighty-six the chump stuff.

170
00:13:54,373 --> 00:14:00,289
It's time to win Leela's heart with
a showy, three-point romantic gesture.

171
00:14:00,493 --> 00:14:05,089
Maybe this is the moment
to show her my real surprise.

172
00:14:08,053 --> 00:14:13,127
- Fry, what are you doing?
- Time to boogie on down to the sauna.

173
00:14:13,493 --> 00:14:16,690
I've been studying how to pilot.
Impressed?

174
00:14:16,933 --> 00:14:19,606
Yeah, actually. You're doing okay.

175
00:14:19,773 --> 00:14:22,571
The reactor temperature is nominal.
The blinker's off.

176
00:14:22,733 --> 00:14:26,123
I learned to work the gravity pump too,
in case we need it.

177
00:14:26,373 --> 00:14:30,286
- So are we dating now?
- Is that what this is all about?

178
00:14:30,453 --> 00:14:32,091
Please, cut it out now.

179
00:14:32,293 --> 00:14:36,730
I know there's some perfect thing
I can do to make you love me.

180
00:14:36,973 --> 00:14:40,682
- When I figure out what it is...
- I don't wanna hurt you...

181
00:14:40,933 --> 00:14:46,087
...but there is absolutely, positively
no way that you and I will ever...

182
00:14:46,373 --> 00:14:51,083
- man and wife.
You may kiss the bride.

183
00:15:00,373 --> 00:15:02,091
He looks radiant.

184
00:15:03,413 --> 00:15:07,486
Bubblegum, we failed.
The time skips haven't stopped.

185
00:15:07,693 --> 00:15:10,924
Even in these formal shorts,
I feel like a failure.

186
00:15:11,133 --> 00:15:13,408
You tricked me into marrying you,
didn't you?

187
00:15:13,573 --> 00:15:14,562
Of course not.

188
00:15:14,773 --> 00:15:19,324
- How'd you do it? Drugs? Hypnosis?
- No, drugs are for losers.

189
00:15:19,493 --> 00:15:22,291
And hypnosis is for losers
with big eyebrows.

190
00:15:22,493 --> 00:15:27,521
I don't know what I did to make
you love me. But we're married now.

191
00:15:27,733 --> 00:15:31,408
- We've got the rest of our lives...
- The divorce is final.

192
00:15:31,653 --> 00:15:33,928
- What?
- Let's divide up the china.

193
00:15:34,173 --> 00:15:38,212
I'll take the NFC helmets,
and you can have the AFC.

194
00:15:38,413 --> 00:15:40,722
Fine. Break my heart again.

195
00:15:41,053 --> 00:15:45,092
Don't be so hard on yourself.
You lost the woman of your dreams...

196
00:15:45,253 --> 00:15:49,371
...but you still have Zoidberg.
You all still have Zoidberg.

197
00:15:49,573 --> 00:15:54,010
How did I get Leela to love me?
I've got to figure it out.

198
00:15:54,213 --> 00:15:58,172
- Maybe you're just a fantastic lover.
- I don't know what I'm doing.

199
00:15:58,373 --> 00:16:01,331
Maybe she'd come back if
I were a Globetrotter.

200
00:16:01,573 --> 00:16:04,724
- What do you say, Bubblegum?
- Hell, no.

201
00:16:04,933 --> 00:16:09,085
It's hopeless. I did something
so great it won Leela's heart...

202
00:16:09,293 --> 00:16:14,208
...and I'll never, ever know
what it was. My life is empty.

203
00:16:14,453 --> 00:16:16,762
Zoidberg.

204
00:16:17,093 --> 00:16:22,804
No wonder we failed. Diverting
Cronotons is mathematically impossible.

205
00:16:22,973 --> 00:16:26,852
I knew I should have checked
your showboating algebra.

206
00:16:27,053 --> 00:16:29,886
I thought you knew that algebra
was all razzmatazz.

207
00:16:30,093 --> 00:16:34,689
A Globetrotter always saves the good
algebra for the final minutes.

208
00:16:34,933 --> 00:16:36,252
Vintage Bubblegum.

209
00:16:36,453 --> 00:16:42,210
The time skips are worse. Isolated
spots are jumping by years. Look.

210
00:16:42,533 --> 00:16:44,171
Stupid senior citizens!

211
00:16:44,373 --> 00:16:49,572
Why should we pay for their benefits?
I deserve free money!

212
00:16:49,773 --> 00:16:55,723
I'm stumped. We'll have to call in the
finest scientific minds in the univer...

213
00:16:55,973 --> 00:17:00,728
We could explode the whole nebula.
What do you think, Curly Joe?

214
00:17:00,893 --> 00:17:05,967
An explosion big enough to destroy that
mama would take out half the universe.

215
00:17:06,173 --> 00:17:11,167
You got to Globetrotter that explosion
up a little. Make it an implosion.

216
00:17:11,373 --> 00:17:13,523
By God, Sweet Clyde is right.

217
00:17:13,693 --> 00:17:18,892
An implosion might form a black hole
that'd stop Cronotons from escaping.

218
00:17:19,093 --> 00:17:21,926
Whoa, slow that
brain train down, prof.

219
00:17:22,093 --> 00:17:25,290
We'd need some kind
of doomsday device.

220
00:17:25,533 --> 00:17:31,529
Doomsday device?
Now the ball's in Farnsworth's court.

221
00:17:34,573 --> 00:17:37,724
I suppose I could part with one
and still be feared.

222
00:17:37,973 --> 00:17:41,761
Give me some skin, prof. I'm making
you an honorary Globetrotter.

223
00:17:41,973 --> 00:17:45,443
In fact, everybody in this room's
an honorary Globetrotter.

224
00:17:45,813 --> 00:17:48,486
I'm a Globetrotter!

225
00:17:49,173 --> 00:17:51,243
- Did you say...?
- Too late, hot plate.

226
00:17:51,453 --> 00:17:52,772
Crap!

227
00:17:57,853 --> 00:18:04,088
We must leave now, for we are needed
elsewhere. But we wish you Godspeed.

228
00:18:05,333 --> 00:18:10,282
Please. Please let me come with you.
I can make myself taller.

229
00:18:10,693 --> 00:18:13,491
You can talk trash.
You can handle the ball.

230
00:18:13,693 --> 00:18:18,403
But ask yourself, are you funky
enough to be a Globetrotter?

231
00:18:18,653 --> 00:18:20,530
- Are you?
- Yes.

232
00:18:20,733 --> 00:18:24,408
- Are you?
- I mean, with time my funk level...

233
00:18:24,613 --> 00:18:27,002
- Are you?
- No.

234
00:18:27,653 --> 00:18:29,450
Deal with it.

235
00:18:46,373 --> 00:18:49,524
- Careful with that doomsday device.
- What does it matter?

236
00:18:49,693 --> 00:18:51,649
I'll never be a Globetrotter.

237
00:18:51,813 --> 00:18:55,647
My life, and, by extension,
everyone else's, is meaningless.

238
00:18:55,813 --> 00:18:57,292
<i>Roger.</i>

239
00:18:57,453 --> 00:19:01,287
Leela, I don't know what
I did to make you love me.

240
00:19:01,453 --> 00:19:04,490
I don't think I tricked you,
but maybe I did.

241
00:19:04,653 --> 00:19:08,328
- And if I did, I'm sorry.
- It's okay, Fry.

242
00:19:08,573 --> 00:19:11,531
- You know we'll always be friends.
- Yeah.

243
00:19:11,773 --> 00:19:16,324
I don't guess anything I do will make
you feel for me the way I feel for you.

244
00:19:16,533 --> 00:19:19,093
I guess not.

245
00:19:22,253 --> 00:19:24,289
The doomsday device is ready.

246
00:19:24,493 --> 00:19:29,806
Maybe blasting this space into a storm
of nothingness will cheer me up.

247
00:19:30,053 --> 00:19:34,490
Okay, let me just take
the ship out to a safe distance.

248
00:19:35,413 --> 00:19:38,803
Actually, I think I'll go
and prep the detonator.

249
00:19:39,053 --> 00:19:41,408
Fry, why don't you take the helm.

250
00:19:45,733 --> 00:19:47,132
She's so great.

251
00:19:47,373 --> 00:19:51,286
I almost remember the thing
I did to make her love me.

252
00:19:51,533 --> 00:19:53,012
But I never will.

253
00:19:53,253 --> 00:19:59,567
Sorry, buddy. I too know what it's like
to have a dream I'll never achieve.

254
00:20:20,813 --> 00:20:25,125
That's how I did it. I moved
the stars to write her a love note.

255
00:20:25,333 --> 00:20:31,329
<i>- Detonation in three, two, one.
- No!</i>

256
00:20:41,293 --> 00:20:43,045
Did you see it?

257
00:20:43,253 --> 00:20:45,892
- The explosion?
- No, not the explosion.

258
00:20:46,093 --> 00:20:48,482
Then what?

259
00:20:48,973 --> 00:20:50,691
Nothing.
