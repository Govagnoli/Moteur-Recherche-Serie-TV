1
00:00:07,333 --> 00:00:09,403
Futurama [5x14] - Obsoletely Fabulous - CiWaN

2
00:00:35,693 --> 00:00:38,605
Ten dollars, please.
Oh, man!

3
00:00:43,413 --> 00:00:48,806
Sleep, little dumpling.
I have replaced your mother.

4
00:00:52,293 --> 00:00:53,487
Aw.

5
00:00:54,733 --> 00:00:59,124
Oh, my God! Robot dealy-Boppers!
And there's a robot scratching post!

6
00:01:00,253 --> 00:01:05,008
You should try it out, Bender.
Please. I have some dignity.

7
00:01:05,733 --> 00:01:09,726
Ladies and gentlemen, my Killbot
features Lotus Notes and a machine gun.

8
00:01:09,893 --> 00:01:14,171
It is the finest available.
Like fun it is, you glass-Headed wallaby!

9
00:01:14,333 --> 00:01:17,131
No one calls me that! I'm having at you!

10
00:01:17,373 --> 00:01:18,726
Wernstrom!

11
00:01:23,093 --> 00:01:24,526
Such senseless aggression.

12
00:01:24,693 --> 00:01:27,287
Come on. Let's go for a paddleboat ride.

13
00:01:36,133 --> 00:01:39,443
The secret was scratching
really, really hard.

14
00:01:40,373 --> 00:01:46,289
And now, the woman who
mom-Opolizes the robot industry...

15
00:01:46,453 --> 00:01:49,809
I get it!
...Mom!

16
00:01:49,973 --> 00:01:52,248
Oh, now I get it!

17
00:01:56,133 --> 00:01:57,885
Hello, dearies.

18
00:01:59,253 --> 00:02:01,050
I love that old bat!

19
00:02:01,253 --> 00:02:04,723
Ladies and gentlemen,
for the 17th year in a row...

20
00:02:04,893 --> 00:02:07,248
The future of robotics has arrived.

21
00:02:07,413 --> 00:02:09,005
Boys.

22
00:02:10,533 --> 00:02:13,525
I give you Robot 1-X.

23
00:02:14,493 --> 00:02:18,168
Ow.
Ow! Oh.

24
00:02:21,733 --> 00:02:23,007
Neat.

25
00:02:23,213 --> 00:02:28,003
Quite frankly, Robot 1-X will put
all my previous models to shame.

26
00:02:28,173 --> 00:02:32,086
Incidentally, would one of my
previous models mind coming up here?

27
00:02:32,293 --> 00:02:34,523
Here! I'm coming!
Come on, baby! I'm yours!

28
00:02:34,693 --> 00:02:36,570
Come on, Mom!
Jerk!

29
00:02:37,653 --> 00:02:40,486
Here we go.
I'm your top of the line, Mom!

30
00:02:41,333 --> 00:02:46,088
Notice that this obsolete robot
runs on alcohol and emits pollution.

31
00:02:46,253 --> 00:02:50,883
Whereas Robot 1-X runs on
pollution and emits pure oxygen...

32
00:02:51,053 --> 00:02:53,203
With a fresh pine scent.

33
00:02:58,893 --> 00:03:00,121
Man, that smells great!

34
00:03:00,333 --> 00:03:04,292
Now let's see how both robots
do at a typical household task:

35
00:03:04,453 --> 00:03:06,728
Sorting a jar of pocket change.

36
00:03:10,933 --> 00:03:15,449
Task completed.
Total value $4.73 and one Albanian lek.

37
00:03:15,613 --> 00:03:19,925
Very good, Robot 1-X.
And you, bending unit?

38
00:03:20,093 --> 00:03:23,722
I never got the change.
Suckers.

39
00:03:24,053 --> 00:03:27,443
Presenting Mom's Friendly Robots.

40
00:03:31,813 --> 00:03:35,408
That new robot is great, huh?
He sure made me look like a pile of crap.

41
00:03:35,573 --> 00:03:39,851
Indeed. That's why I bought
one to help around the office.

42
00:03:43,533 --> 00:03:48,049
Let's try him out. Robot 1-X,
can you clean Nibbler's stanky litter box?

43
00:03:48,253 --> 00:03:49,686
I can, and will.

44
00:03:55,613 --> 00:03:57,649
Hey, I could have done
that if you'd ask me.

45
00:03:57,853 --> 00:04:00,526
I asked you five minutes ago.

46
00:04:03,813 --> 00:04:06,122
You call that a kiss? I'll show you!

47
00:04:06,333 --> 00:04:08,563
Come here, Nibbler!

48
00:04:10,213 --> 00:04:14,604
Look, Bender. If you want something to
do, stop making out and give us a hand.

49
00:04:14,773 --> 00:04:17,446
Go up on the roof and install
this fake satellite dish...

50
00:04:17,613 --> 00:04:21,447
So we can impress the neighbors.
Yes, sir! I'm on it.

51
00:04:21,613 --> 00:04:24,571
Oh, and have Robot 1-X help you.
God!

52
00:04:29,173 --> 00:04:31,733
Get out of here, freshman!
I don't need your help!

53
00:04:31,933 --> 00:04:36,643
Our owners asked me to assist you.
Yeah? Well, assist this!

54
00:04:36,813 --> 00:04:40,203
Whoa! Ah! Help!

55
00:04:43,413 --> 00:04:46,291
When I screamed "Help,"
I didn't mean you!

56
00:04:46,493 --> 00:04:50,406
I apologize. However, I was able to
do your job before I saved your life.

57
00:04:58,293 --> 00:05:02,047
Don't mind me. I'm just saving you
the trouble of throwing me away.

58
00:05:02,333 --> 00:05:05,450
Mell out, Bender. Come watch some TV.

59
00:05:08,293 --> 00:05:10,409
I can't. I'm stuck in the can.

60
00:05:10,613 --> 00:05:13,411
Well, ask Robot 1-X to pull you out.

61
00:05:13,573 --> 00:05:14,926
Never!

62
00:05:16,933 --> 00:05:19,288
Why can't you accept his help?
I hate him!

63
00:05:19,493 --> 00:05:21,882
But he's just a tool to
make your life easier.

64
00:05:22,053 --> 00:05:24,283
Like a socket wrench, or a burglar's kit.

65
00:05:26,493 --> 00:05:30,452
I can't ask for his help because...
Yes?

66
00:05:30,893 --> 00:05:32,406
I'm scared of him.

67
00:05:35,613 --> 00:05:38,969
Oh, sorry.
Well, then, there's only one solution.

68
00:05:39,173 --> 00:05:41,448
You need an upgrade to
make you compatible...

69
00:05:41,613 --> 00:05:44,047
With Robot 1-X's new technology.

70
00:05:44,373 --> 00:05:47,331
An upgrade? But I thought
we all agreed I was perfect.

71
00:05:47,493 --> 00:05:51,281
Fry, didn't we agree I was perfect?
Oh, yeah. No, you're pretty perfect.

72
00:05:51,853 --> 00:05:56,244
"Pretty perfect"?
So you do think I need an upgrade.

73
00:05:56,453 --> 00:05:58,205
Yes, for God's sakes, yes!

74
00:05:58,413 --> 00:06:03,009
Fine. I'll be back in a few days.

75
00:06:14,053 --> 00:06:16,123
Man, I hate those new 1-X robots.

76
00:06:16,333 --> 00:06:18,972
I'd like to stab them!
Give them some of these!

77
00:06:21,613 --> 00:06:23,331
Yeah, right on, nut cake.

78
00:06:23,493 --> 00:06:27,611
Parole officer says I gotta upgrade,
or he won't give me back my stabbing knife.

79
00:06:27,773 --> 00:06:30,526
But it's no big.
I hate those 1-X so much.

80
00:06:30,693 --> 00:06:33,161
I know it won't affect me.

81
00:06:36,573 --> 00:06:38,768
Death to the 1-X Robots!

82
00:06:42,053 --> 00:06:45,045
I love those magnificent 1-X Robots!

83
00:06:45,213 --> 00:06:47,602
The 1-X Robots are my friends.

84
00:06:47,813 --> 00:06:50,964
Wait. What happened to your
enthusiasm for stabbing them?

85
00:06:51,173 --> 00:06:53,323
I'm past that. Later, blood.

86
00:06:53,533 --> 00:06:55,888
It's like he's not him anymore.

87
00:06:56,093 --> 00:06:58,288
You took away his robo-Humanity!

88
00:07:04,733 --> 00:07:06,166
I changed my mind!

89
00:07:21,333 --> 00:07:24,405
Yeah. I did it! I escaped.

90
00:07:24,573 --> 00:07:26,211
But to what kind of a life?

91
00:07:27,653 --> 00:07:29,609
I'm too scared to get the upgrade...

92
00:07:29,773 --> 00:07:33,368
But I can't face my
friends again without it.

93
00:07:43,613 --> 00:07:47,891
And so, I set sail for unknown shores.

94
00:07:48,093 --> 00:07:52,848
Oh, merciful Poseidon,
take pity on this mechanical mariner.

95
00:07:55,813 --> 00:07:57,644
Oh, jeez.

96
00:08:03,013 --> 00:08:06,483
Whoa! Whoa! Oh, uh. Whoa!

97
00:08:09,973 --> 00:08:12,885
Curse you, merciful Poseidon!

98
00:08:25,173 --> 00:08:28,165
Boy, what is the deal with the ocean?

99
00:08:29,853 --> 00:08:31,730
A tropical island, huh?

100
00:08:31,933 --> 00:08:34,367
Well, I've washed up in worse places.

101
00:08:34,533 --> 00:08:38,003
Okay, first up, I'm gonna
need to build a shelter.

102
00:08:42,493 --> 00:08:44,245
There.

103
00:08:44,413 --> 00:08:47,928
Well, I guess I'll go out for a while.

104
00:08:53,373 --> 00:08:55,807
Damn. One rock short of rescue.

105
00:09:13,653 --> 00:09:15,609
Low on power.

106
00:09:15,773 --> 00:09:17,684
Better fuel up.

107
00:09:18,453 --> 00:09:23,083
Oh, no! Guess I'll do what I always do
when I run out of booze.

108
00:09:31,413 --> 00:09:33,165
Okay, don't panic.

109
00:09:33,373 --> 00:09:36,763
I've got these yams.
I'll just make some yam schnapps.

110
00:09:39,693 --> 00:09:41,524
Hmm.

111
00:09:47,973 --> 00:09:51,363
Hey, I should be mad at you.
Now, turn around.

112
00:09:53,253 --> 00:09:55,721
Funny now hot.

113
00:09:59,933 --> 00:10:01,207
Beer!

114
00:10:07,373 --> 00:10:08,726
Ow!

115
00:10:15,893 --> 00:10:20,728
Oh . Numb. Oh.

116
00:10:22,413 --> 00:10:25,052
Who is it?

117
00:10:26,173 --> 00:10:27,731
Ow!

118
00:10:43,493 --> 00:10:45,404
Who are you, and why should I care?

119
00:10:49,373 --> 00:10:53,844
Side A. We're a community of outdated
robots who refused to upgrade...

120
00:10:54,013 --> 00:10:56,288
And came here-- Side B.

121
00:10:56,453 --> 00:10:59,570
To live a simpler existence,
free of technology.

122
00:10:59,773 --> 00:11:02,241
A working cartridge unit? Wow.

123
00:11:02,413 --> 00:11:04,449
You guys went obsolete years ago.

124
00:11:07,093 --> 00:11:08,572
Your mother.

125
00:11:08,733 --> 00:11:11,566
What Cartridge Unit means is,
the things that make us obsolete...

126
00:11:11,733 --> 00:11:13,052
Also make us unique.

127
00:11:13,213 --> 00:11:15,966
I, for example, need to keep
refilling my waterwheel...

128
00:11:16,133 --> 00:11:18,522
Or I'll power-Down forever.

129
00:11:18,693 --> 00:11:23,448
Oh, God! I'll never make it this time!
This is the end!

130
00:11:24,293 --> 00:11:27,603
Anyway, we like it here.
Like you have a choice.

131
00:11:27,773 --> 00:11:30,810
So, what's your problem?
Not enough .

132
00:11:31,013 --> 00:11:32,366
Memory?
Oh, great.

133
00:11:32,533 --> 00:11:35,366
Now I remember that word,
but I forgot my wife's face.

134
00:11:35,533 --> 00:11:39,412
Oh, God! No! I want to live!

135
00:11:41,453 --> 00:11:44,092
If you'd like, you're
welcome to join our society.

136
00:11:44,253 --> 00:11:48,849
Look, no offense, but I need technology,
especially e-Mail and snowmobiles.

137
00:11:49,013 --> 00:11:52,801
And television. Without television,
how will I know what's buzz-Worthy?

138
00:11:53,013 --> 00:11:57,052
Why would you want to watch TV when
you can watch a snail crawl for hours?

139
00:11:57,413 --> 00:11:59,927
That's the dumbest
thing I've ever heard.

140
00:12:03,213 --> 00:12:05,727
Oh, man! He's never gonna
make it over that pebble!

141
00:12:05,893 --> 00:12:09,090
Wait! Wait! Oh, my God! He made it!

142
00:12:09,253 --> 00:12:11,369
Yeah! Way to go!

143
00:12:11,533 --> 00:12:13,728
That was the greatest thing ever!
Let's party.

144
00:12:20,693 --> 00:12:23,161
Yeah, baby! Come on!
Where did you get that CD?

145
00:12:23,333 --> 00:12:25,483
It's one of my 10 desert-Island disks.

146
00:12:25,653 --> 00:12:28,326
I never really thought I'd use them,
but look at me now.

147
00:12:28,493 --> 00:12:32,247
Oh, yeah, baby! Gonna do that dance .

148
00:12:32,453 --> 00:12:35,604
CDs are unnatural.
Why don't you just listen to the ocean?

149
00:12:35,813 --> 00:12:37,371
Which ocean? That ocean?

150
00:12:40,653 --> 00:12:44,089
Wow. It's like the Earth making
sweet, salty love to itself...

151
00:12:44,253 --> 00:12:49,452
While all the fish groove on it.
So much for this garbage.

152
00:12:51,733 --> 00:12:54,293
Take that, Beethoven, you deaf bastard!

153
00:12:57,213 --> 00:12:58,532
Bang, bang, bang.

154
00:12:58,693 --> 00:13:02,402
You sure got this life thing figured out,
cymbal-Banging monkey.

155
00:13:02,573 --> 00:13:05,133
Hi, Bender. We know how
much you miss technology...

156
00:13:05,293 --> 00:13:08,251
So we brought you this washing
machine that drifted ashore.

157
00:13:11,773 --> 00:13:15,243
I'm gonna wash my
linens so hard, the--

158
00:13:34,733 --> 00:13:37,042
You .

159
00:13:37,773 --> 00:13:39,889
What? I don't understand.

160
00:13:40,053 --> 00:13:43,125
Wretched technology has
brought me nothing but misery.

161
00:13:46,013 --> 00:13:48,288
But Bender, you are technology.

162
00:13:48,493 --> 00:13:50,961
You're the most advanced
thing on this entire island.

163
00:13:51,333 --> 00:13:55,804
Oh, it's true. I am a hideous
triumph of form and function.

164
00:13:56,093 --> 00:13:58,607
But not for long!

165
00:14:01,453 --> 00:14:03,569
Oh! That hurt!

166
00:14:06,453 --> 00:14:09,126
The downgrade is complete!

167
00:14:11,813 --> 00:14:14,373
Behold my handcrafted purity.

168
00:14:14,533 --> 00:14:18,765
The modern world can bite
my splintery wooden ass!

169
00:14:19,493 --> 00:14:21,085
Ah.

170
00:14:21,333 --> 00:14:24,325
Welcome to your new life
of simple tranquility.

171
00:14:24,693 --> 00:14:29,323
Forget that! I say the whole world
must learn of our peaceful ways!

172
00:14:29,533 --> 00:14:30,807
By force!

173
00:14:34,093 --> 00:14:36,607
What?
We're going back to civilization...

174
00:14:36,773 --> 00:14:39,287
To wage war on technology!

175
00:14:40,813 --> 00:14:41,802
What?

176
00:14:51,213 --> 00:14:53,010
Row, comrades, row!

177
00:14:53,213 --> 00:14:55,249
We'll stage an attack on technology...

178
00:14:55,413 --> 00:14:58,325
Worthy of being chronicled
in an anthem by Rush.

179
00:14:58,533 --> 00:15:00,285
We've been sailing for three weeks.

180
00:15:00,453 --> 00:15:03,013
Maybe I should check our
position with the periscope.

181
00:15:03,173 --> 00:15:05,482
Aye, up!

182
00:15:06,893 --> 00:15:11,091
Mirrors reflecting mirrors?
High-Tech sorcery! Sorcery, I say!

183
00:15:15,653 --> 00:15:17,644
Did you see anything?
Yep, we're there.

184
00:15:17,813 --> 00:15:19,644
Prepare to surface!

185
00:15:23,533 --> 00:15:27,731
And now, technology shall taste
the lash of the hickory switch!

186
00:16:08,413 --> 00:16:10,005
Technology is defeated!

187
00:16:10,173 --> 00:16:13,131
Let us return to the island
and celebrate by counting rocks!

188
00:16:13,333 --> 00:16:15,164
Yeah!

189
00:16:15,373 --> 00:16:18,126
Whoa! Whoa! No one wants to
count rocks more than me...

190
00:16:18,293 --> 00:16:20,249
But our mission is not complete.

191
00:16:20,453 --> 00:16:24,571
Not so long as Robot 1-X torments
me with his obvious superiority.

192
00:16:24,773 --> 00:16:26,570
Ready the catapult, Sinclair!

193
00:16:30,093 --> 00:16:31,765
Aim for their power lines!

194
00:16:31,973 --> 00:16:34,931
They're the devil's veins,
and electricity is his blood!

195
00:16:35,093 --> 00:16:40,406
Bender? If we don't survive the attack,
I want you to know I love you.

196
00:16:40,613 --> 00:16:42,331
Okay, fine. Fire!

197
00:16:47,813 --> 00:16:51,852
Oh! I'm blind!
Professor, we have no power!

198
00:16:52,013 --> 00:16:55,130
What do you mean, "no power"?
We're living in the future!

199
00:16:55,333 --> 00:16:57,483
I'd better light some candles.

200
00:17:00,813 --> 00:17:04,772
Friends, I've come to free you
from your complicated lives!

201
00:17:04,933 --> 00:17:08,448
Free you from the "complicated" part,
I mean, not the "Iives" part.

202
00:17:08,653 --> 00:17:10,450
Oh, Lord, he's made of wood.

203
00:17:10,613 --> 00:17:13,764
What now, Bender?
I got a downgrade.

204
00:17:13,933 --> 00:17:17,050
I'm a steam-Powered wooden robot,
just as nature intended.

205
00:17:17,213 --> 00:17:21,650
Therefore, I must kill Robot 1-X!
That's just stupid!

206
00:17:22,733 --> 00:17:26,248
Does Mr. Bender wish
me to destroy myself?

207
00:17:26,613 --> 00:17:28,205
I don't need your charity.

208
00:17:28,373 --> 00:17:31,092
Target Robot 1-X and fire!

209
00:17:42,613 --> 00:17:45,923
You wanged my ship,
you walnut-Paneled idiot!

210
00:17:46,133 --> 00:17:49,409
Try again, Sinclair.
I said target Robot 1-X.

211
00:17:49,573 --> 00:17:53,248
Who's Robot 1-X? Launching.

212
00:17:56,773 --> 00:18:00,288
So I guess everything worked out fine.

213
00:18:05,813 --> 00:18:07,963
Great. Now we're being crushed.

214
00:18:11,973 --> 00:18:13,725
Help us, wooden Bender!

215
00:18:19,133 --> 00:18:22,011
Those guys hate fire!
I gotta do something!

216
00:18:30,373 --> 00:18:32,125
What the--? Termites?

217
00:18:32,293 --> 00:18:34,966
Well, I don't need
legs to save my friends.

218
00:18:35,133 --> 00:18:37,283
I'll just use the old
extenso-Matic arms.

219
00:18:39,373 --> 00:18:42,445
Bender! Hurry! This fuel is expensive!

220
00:18:42,613 --> 00:18:46,652
Also, we're dying!
I'm a-Coming!

221
00:18:53,973 --> 00:18:57,010
Ow! Lousy primitive body!

222
00:18:57,173 --> 00:19:01,451
Oh, why didn't I get that upgrade?
I'm an outdated piece of junk.

223
00:19:02,013 --> 00:19:04,652
Sir, might I recommend--?
You shut up!

224
00:19:04,853 --> 00:19:07,572
No, wait. I can use you as
a tool to save my friends.

225
00:19:07,733 --> 00:19:11,282
And I'll still be the hero,
who everyone says how great he was.

226
00:19:11,493 --> 00:19:16,442
How may I help you?
Save my friends! And Zoidberg!

227
00:19:27,813 --> 00:19:31,283
Look! My hair got singed
into an even cuter 'do.

228
00:19:31,493 --> 00:19:33,848
Hey, where's Bender?
Down here.

229
00:19:36,053 --> 00:19:38,806
I'm so sorry, guys.
I never meant to hurt you...

230
00:19:38,973 --> 00:19:41,692
Just to destroy everything
you ever believed in.

231
00:19:41,893 --> 00:19:44,043
Well, at least you saved us from...

232
00:19:44,253 --> 00:19:45,686
Uh, you.

233
00:19:45,853 --> 00:19:49,209
Thank God you finally overcame
your incompatibility with Robot 1-X.

234
00:19:49,413 --> 00:19:51,324
Oh, yeah, we were totally in sync.

235
00:19:51,493 --> 00:19:55,452
I was like, "Save them! " And he was all,
"No problem. " And then he did it.

236
00:19:55,613 --> 00:20:00,084
His new technology is great.
I love those magnificent 1-X Robots.

237
00:20:00,253 --> 00:20:02,813
The 1-X Robots are my friends.

238
00:20:03,733 --> 00:20:06,406
It's like his personality
is totally different now.

239
00:20:06,573 --> 00:20:08,928
Oh, maybe this upgrade
isn't such a good idea.

240
00:20:09,413 --> 00:20:12,530
I'd like to give Robot
1-X a big smooch on the--

241
00:20:12,693 --> 00:20:15,571
Hey, what's the dealy-O?
Your upgrade is complete.

242
00:20:15,773 --> 00:20:17,889
But I destroyed the
technology of the world.

243
00:20:18,053 --> 00:20:21,204
I ran on the beach and felt
the sand between my foot-Cups.

244
00:20:21,413 --> 00:20:23,483
Everyone experiences
the upgrade differently.

245
00:20:23,773 --> 00:20:28,449
If that stuff wasn't real,
how can I be sure anything is real?

246
00:20:28,613 --> 00:20:31,173
Is it not possible, nay, probable...

247
00:20:31,333 --> 00:20:36,088
That my whole life is just a product
of my, or someone else's imagination?

248
00:20:36,293 --> 00:20:38,284
No. Get out. Next?

249
00:20:46,813 --> 00:20:50,010
Well, I guess reality
is what you make of it.

250
00:20:53,373 --> 00:20:56,570
Yep. Oh, thanks, baby.
