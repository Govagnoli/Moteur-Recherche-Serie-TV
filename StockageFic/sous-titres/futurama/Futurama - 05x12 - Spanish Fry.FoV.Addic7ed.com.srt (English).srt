1
00:00:02,333 --> 00:00:04,893
Prepare for the stereophonic
experience.

2
00:00:07,293 --> 00:00:09,363
Futurama [5x12] - Spanish Fry - CiWaN

3
00:00:12,813 --> 00:00:14,610
Oh, New New York City!

4
00:00:14,773 --> 00:00:18,083
Whoo! Whoo!

5
00:00:18,973 --> 00:00:21,248
Don't worry about it.

6
00:00:23,053 --> 00:00:25,772
Do the robot, baby!

7
00:00:39,773 --> 00:00:45,166
Oh, Lord. Hiking is always
such a strain on the buttocks.

8
00:00:46,933 --> 00:00:49,606
What was that sound?
It wasn't a bird's nest falling.

9
00:00:49,773 --> 00:00:52,003
That sounds like this:

10
00:00:54,013 --> 00:00:57,608
They're so cute when they're scared.
I meant the sound Bigfoot just made.

11
00:00:57,773 --> 00:01:02,085
He's been sighted in this area recently.
Just last week, a blind hiker felt him.

12
00:01:02,293 --> 00:01:06,571
Don't tell me you actually believe in
Bigfoot, you blathering ninny-Hammer.

13
00:01:06,773 --> 00:01:08,764
Of course I do. Bigfoot's my hero.

14
00:01:08,933 --> 00:01:11,731
Growing up, he was the
celebrity I most identified with.

15
00:01:11,933 --> 00:01:13,844
Why?
Because he was a loner who hated...

16
00:01:14,013 --> 00:01:16,049
The popular monsters
yet longed to be one.

17
00:01:16,253 --> 00:01:19,131
I can so relate to that.

18
00:01:21,213 --> 00:01:25,365
Enough emotions. This isn't
a fat camp, for God's sake.

19
00:01:25,533 --> 00:01:28,172
Although you wouldn't
know it from looking.

20
00:01:36,133 --> 00:01:37,885
Ah.

21
00:01:38,053 --> 00:01:40,362
Bender, if you want to
sleep in the tent tonight...

22
00:01:40,533 --> 00:01:44,765
You're welcome to join me and Hermes
for a little "just friends" spooning.

23
00:01:44,933 --> 00:01:47,242
No, I'm comfy out here under the stars.

24
00:01:49,653 --> 00:01:51,291
Real comfy.

25
00:01:53,733 --> 00:01:56,531
Hi, I'm Ranger Park, the park ranger.
I get it.

26
00:01:56,733 --> 00:01:58,769
Since this is a national
Bigfoot preserve...

27
00:01:58,933 --> 00:02:03,006
We'll start with a short film about
Bigfoot while I make a few phone calls.

28
00:02:04,733 --> 00:02:08,726
Bigfoot. Endangered mystery.

29
00:02:08,933 --> 00:02:11,527
In the dense forests of
the Pacific Northwest...

30
00:02:11,693 --> 00:02:15,686
Dwells the strange and beautiful
creature known as Bigfoot, perhaps.

31
00:02:15,893 --> 00:02:19,283
That proves it.
Sadly, logging and human settlement...

32
00:02:19,453 --> 00:02:21,921
Today threaten what might
possibly be his habitat.

33
00:02:22,093 --> 00:02:24,561
Although if it's not, they don't.

34
00:02:24,773 --> 00:02:29,051
Bigfoot populations require vast
amounts of land to remain elusive in.

35
00:02:29,253 --> 00:02:33,212
They typically dwelljust behind rocks,
but are also sometimes playful...

36
00:02:33,413 --> 00:02:36,610
Bounding into thick fogs
and out-Of-Focus areas.

37
00:02:36,893 --> 00:02:39,646
It should say "Top Quality
Exercycle For Sale. "

38
00:02:39,813 --> 00:02:43,965
And could you put "Top Quality" in bold?
You can't? Okay, whatever.

39
00:02:44,173 --> 00:02:46,129
Remember, it's up to us.

40
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:49,609
Bigfoot is a crucial part of
the ecosystem, if he exists.

41
00:02:49,813 --> 00:02:52,327
So let's all help keep
Bigfoot possibly alive...

42
00:02:52,493 --> 00:02:56,406
For future generations to enjoy,
unless he doesn't exist.

43
00:02:56,613 --> 00:02:58,490
The end!

44
00:02:59,933 --> 00:03:02,447
I gotta call you back.
All right, questions?

45
00:03:02,653 --> 00:03:06,487
Yeah. Have yous ever seens Bigfeet?
Technically, no.

46
00:03:06,653 --> 00:03:09,121
But I do see him each
night in my dreams...

47
00:03:09,293 --> 00:03:12,365
And each day in the smiling
faces of hairy children.

48
00:03:12,573 --> 00:03:17,647
Bunk! Bunk, I say! Bring me a bag
full of Bigfoot's droppings or shut up.

49
00:03:17,853 --> 00:03:19,491
I have some of someone who saw him.

50
00:03:19,693 --> 00:03:22,207
Shut up.
Oh, my God. Look, it's Bigfoot.

51
00:03:22,413 --> 00:03:23,971
Where?!
Oh, he's gone.

52
00:03:24,133 --> 00:03:26,408
He said you should keep
wasting your life, though.

53
00:03:26,653 --> 00:03:30,168
I saw Bigfoot crushing
cars at the county fair.

54
00:03:30,373 --> 00:03:32,682
What you saw was Bigfoot
the monster truck.

55
00:03:32,853 --> 00:03:34,252
But thanks for a great question.

56
00:03:36,253 --> 00:03:39,643
Sir, if I may? Why don't you just set
up, like, a billion video cameras...

57
00:03:39,813 --> 00:03:41,690
In the woods and see if he walks by one?

58
00:03:41,853 --> 00:03:44,413
Ah. That would be very expensive...

59
00:03:44,573 --> 00:03:47,041
And most people who believe
in Bigfoot are broke.

60
00:03:47,253 --> 00:03:49,084
Hey, look! Bigfoot. He's back.

61
00:03:49,293 --> 00:03:52,365
Where?
Up your face.

62
00:03:52,813 --> 00:03:54,690
Everybody do the Bender.

63
00:03:58,973 --> 00:04:02,886
The sky out here is amazing.
Look at all the satellites.

64
00:04:10,173 --> 00:04:13,609
Good night, employees.
Good night.

65
00:04:13,773 --> 00:04:16,685
Good night, Hubert.

66
00:04:18,413 --> 00:04:22,565
You doing all right out there, buddy?
Better than these gnats.

67
00:04:25,373 --> 00:04:27,603
That guy won't be
going home to his kids.

68
00:04:35,853 --> 00:04:38,811
What's that? A wolf?
Or some kind of boogin?

69
00:04:38,973 --> 00:04:42,443
Oh, God, I wish I was
safe inside a tent.

70
00:04:42,613 --> 00:04:46,288
Fry. Fry, wake up.
It's me, Bigface.

71
00:04:46,493 --> 00:04:49,291
Come out and groom my mangy fur.

72
00:04:49,453 --> 00:04:51,808
Bigfoot? You taught yourself English?

73
00:04:53,493 --> 00:04:57,042
Bigfoot. Bigfoot!

74
00:05:08,613 --> 00:05:12,162
Bigfoot? Ls that you?
I'm not like the others, Bigfoot.

75
00:05:12,333 --> 00:05:16,042
I see through your monster
coating to the gentle loner inside.

76
00:05:16,213 --> 00:05:17,965
I bet you have a
wounded raccoon friend...

77
00:05:18,133 --> 00:05:20,522
That you tenderly nurse
back to health while you go:

78
00:05:21,933 --> 00:05:24,652
In the end, they shoot you,
but you teach us about things.

79
00:05:40,253 --> 00:05:41,242
Oh.

80
00:05:42,973 --> 00:05:44,486
Oh. Just a flying saucer.

81
00:05:44,813 --> 00:05:49,329
Excuse me? You can't park here.
The parking area is over there.

82
00:05:52,733 --> 00:05:54,963
Wow. Nice tube.

83
00:05:55,413 --> 00:05:58,610
Hey. Hey, what's the big idea?
Stop abducting me.

84
00:05:58,813 --> 00:06:01,088
Why does your vanity
plate say "Probe 1 "?

85
00:06:01,293 --> 00:06:06,413
Help!

86
00:06:16,373 --> 00:06:17,886
There's nothing so refreshing...

87
00:06:18,053 --> 00:06:21,728
As the clean, crisp taste
of this bold Canadian beer.

88
00:06:22,733 --> 00:06:26,851
Well, see you in an hour. I got to
go do some business behind that tree.

89
00:06:38,973 --> 00:06:42,807
Bender, wasn't that Fry's tent?
"Bender . "

90
00:06:42,973 --> 00:06:46,010
Bender raises a good point.
Where is Fry?

91
00:06:56,253 --> 00:07:00,769
You won't believe what happened.
It was so scary that you wouldn't--

92
00:07:00,933 --> 00:07:03,003
I know. But listen, it gets even scarier.

93
00:07:03,173 --> 00:07:05,971
Fry, what in Sega
Genesis happened to you?

94
00:07:06,133 --> 00:07:08,647
That's what I'm trying
to tell you. See--

95
00:07:09,093 --> 00:07:13,052
Why are you all staring at me like that?
Is there something on my face?

96
00:07:13,213 --> 00:07:15,408
Uh . No.

97
00:07:16,693 --> 00:07:18,490
Someone should tell him.
Tell me what?

98
00:07:18,653 --> 00:07:21,247
Nothing.
Well, I have a lot of experience...

99
00:07:21,413 --> 00:07:26,009
Telling patients bad news,
so let me break it to him gently.

100
00:07:26,173 --> 00:07:30,007
Fry, you have no nose.
Your nose is gone.

101
00:07:30,173 --> 00:07:33,165
You have no nose on your face.
Where it is, I can't say...

102
00:07:33,333 --> 00:07:35,483
But on your face it's not.

103
00:07:35,693 --> 00:07:37,524
What?

104
00:07:39,053 --> 00:07:40,372
I think it's sweet.

105
00:07:40,533 --> 00:07:44,048
You chopped off your nose so you could
look more like your hero: me, Bender.

106
00:07:44,253 --> 00:07:46,562
My God.
They must have taken it last night.

107
00:07:46,733 --> 00:07:49,691
Which last night?
In the woods. I was walking.

108
00:07:49,853 --> 00:07:52,686
For Bigfoot, looking.
And then aliens beamed me up.

109
00:07:52,893 --> 00:07:56,568
Were they little gray
dudes with big oval heads?

110
00:07:57,173 --> 00:07:59,209
I don't get that gesture. Am I wrong?

111
00:07:59,413 --> 00:08:01,688
Cheer up, friend. When we get home...

112
00:08:01,853 --> 00:08:06,404
A high-Quality prosthesis
will have you looking good as new.

113
00:08:07,333 --> 00:08:10,245
I'm a pathetic freak. My life is ruined.

114
00:08:12,333 --> 00:08:14,608
Man, you are such a jokester.

115
00:08:14,813 --> 00:08:18,567
I'll never have another
moment of happiness.

116
00:08:22,373 --> 00:08:25,809
I know you're trying to mask your
pain with humor, but don't worry.

117
00:08:25,973 --> 00:08:28,282
I'm sure the professor
can clone you a new nose.

118
00:08:28,533 --> 00:08:31,605
It wouldn't be the same.
I want my nose.

119
00:08:31,773 --> 00:08:34,526
I don't want to teach a new one
how to shoot milk when I laugh.

120
00:08:34,693 --> 00:08:38,322
Well, there's no sense fretting.
Good Lord, you're ugly.

121
00:08:38,493 --> 00:08:42,805
The fact is, your nose is gone and we'll
never find out who did it or why.

122
00:08:44,333 --> 00:08:46,893
Guys. Guys. There's
something on television.

123
00:08:47,413 --> 00:08:51,008
Alien abductions.
Until now, a harmless nuisance.

124
00:08:51,213 --> 00:08:53,773
But recently, they've taken
on a sinister dimension...

125
00:08:53,933 --> 00:08:57,323
As unsuspecting victims
are returned without noses.

126
00:08:57,533 --> 00:08:59,285
Like me!
The culprits:

127
00:08:59,453 --> 00:09:02,763
Shameless poachers,
hunting humans without a permit.

128
00:09:02,973 --> 00:09:05,328
The valuable nose, or human horn...

129
00:09:05,493 --> 00:09:08,963
Fetches a high price on alien
worlds as an aphrodisiac.

130
00:09:09,173 --> 00:09:13,564
My nose is an aphrodisiac?
I'm gonna drop a barf.

131
00:09:13,773 --> 00:09:17,368
Demand for human horn is great,
due in part to titillating scenes...

132
00:09:17,533 --> 00:09:21,890
From depraved alien TV programs
too filthy for Earth broadcast.

133
00:09:22,053 --> 00:09:23,930
Let's watch.

134
00:09:26,053 --> 00:09:28,965
Human horn? But it is forbidden.

135
00:09:29,173 --> 00:09:31,641
So is our love.

136
00:09:41,693 --> 00:09:44,969
We have to track down my
nose before some alien...

137
00:09:45,133 --> 00:09:47,089
Snarfs it and does the worm.
Who's in?

138
00:09:47,293 --> 00:09:49,966
Me and Bender and maybe Zoidberg,
if he feels like it.

139
00:09:50,173 --> 00:09:51,367
No, I'm good.

140
00:10:02,773 --> 00:10:07,130
Let's see, I'll take a pancreas,
two sphincters and a large Coke.

141
00:10:07,293 --> 00:10:10,365
One number 3 combo.

142
00:10:13,813 --> 00:10:16,122
It's no use. We've been
to every scuzzy bazaar...

143
00:10:16,293 --> 00:10:18,284
In the galaxy, including Pottery Barn.

144
00:10:18,453 --> 00:10:20,011
Wait. What's that?

145
00:10:25,093 --> 00:10:28,802
Welcome, friends.
How may I pervert you?

146
00:10:29,053 --> 00:10:31,487
Uh . I'm looking for human horn.
Shh!

147
00:10:31,653 --> 00:10:35,805
You're not cops, right?
Of course not. In fact, he's a crook.

148
00:10:35,973 --> 00:10:38,965
Yep. Stolen Pez, anyone?

149
00:10:41,093 --> 00:10:43,209
Right this way.

150
00:10:45,413 --> 00:10:50,487
Human horn. So fresh you can
still see the eyeglass marks.

151
00:10:50,933 --> 00:10:53,845
Nope. Uh-Uh. Ew!

152
00:10:54,733 --> 00:10:57,486
Look, this is the nose we want.
Did you sell it to somebody?

153
00:10:57,693 --> 00:11:01,925
I'm sorry, sir, but due to the
perverted nature of our business...

154
00:11:02,133 --> 00:11:06,012
Customer records are
strictly confidential.

155
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:08,483
Right this way.

156
00:11:09,973 --> 00:11:14,444
I videotape everyone who comes in
here so I can blackmail them later.

157
00:11:14,693 --> 00:11:15,842
Ew!

158
00:11:16,053 --> 00:11:19,523
Hey, I'm a porno-Dealing monster.
What do I care what you think?

159
00:11:19,693 --> 00:11:23,208
Here's the weirdo who bought your horn.

160
00:11:24,293 --> 00:11:28,571
That's Lrrr, ruler of the
planet Omicron Persei 8.

161
00:11:28,733 --> 00:11:31,770
You got any, you know, human horn?

162
00:11:31,933 --> 00:11:36,085
Speak up, you're muttering.
I said.... Human horn?

163
00:11:36,253 --> 00:11:38,244
You're not a cop, right?
Oh, no, no.

164
00:11:38,413 --> 00:11:44,409
I'm just some guy, ruler of
the planet Omicron Persei 8!

165
00:11:55,213 --> 00:11:56,646
So let me get this straight.

166
00:11:56,853 --> 00:12:00,482
If I buy eight Caramello bars,
you all get to go to some camp?

167
00:12:00,693 --> 00:12:04,083
Yep. That's exactly the lie we
used to get past your guards.

168
00:12:04,253 --> 00:12:07,882
Oh, great space king, I humbly
beg you to return my human horn.

169
00:12:09,013 --> 00:12:11,322
Human horn? How ridiculous.

170
00:12:11,493 --> 00:12:14,724
Why would a virile male
like Lrrr need human horn?

171
00:12:14,933 --> 00:12:17,049
I don't even know what it's for.
What is it...

172
00:12:17,213 --> 00:12:20,762
Something you put in salad dressing?
Like you've ever seen a salad.

173
00:12:20,933 --> 00:12:23,003
My weight is appropriate and attractive.

174
00:12:23,213 --> 00:12:25,681
You guys have issues.

175
00:12:25,893 --> 00:12:28,168
She has issues. I'm fine.

176
00:12:28,333 --> 00:12:32,212
But there's no human horn around here,
so make friends with the door.

177
00:12:32,413 --> 00:12:34,688
All right, I give up.

178
00:12:34,853 --> 00:12:38,482
I guess I'll just go
home and marry a skunk.

179
00:12:39,133 --> 00:12:41,442
Oh, let's just give it to him. Here.

180
00:12:41,653 --> 00:12:44,042
My nose! Light of my face!

181
00:12:44,293 --> 00:12:47,649
What is that?
How do you have that, Ndnd?

182
00:12:47,853 --> 00:12:51,607
I've never seen it before.
My friend left it here.

183
00:12:52,053 --> 00:12:57,002
Hold still, Fry. I can reattach
it with my emergency face laser.

184
00:12:58,773 --> 00:13:00,286
Hey, you burned my cheek.

185
00:13:00,493 --> 00:13:02,484
Yeah, sorry, I wasn't
really concentrating.

186
00:13:02,693 --> 00:13:05,765
No, I mean--
The singed flesh, I can smell it.

187
00:13:05,973 --> 00:13:09,568
And those lilacs on the table.
At least someone noticed.

188
00:13:09,773 --> 00:13:12,162
For the last time, I don't like lilacs.

189
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:14,563
Your first wife was the
one who liked lilacs.

190
00:13:14,733 --> 00:13:16,166
She also liked to shut up.

191
00:13:16,533 --> 00:13:19,206
Well, great seeing you. We'll be on our--
Yo, Highness.

192
00:13:19,453 --> 00:13:22,729
Just out of robo-Curiosity,
why would you use a guy's nose...

193
00:13:22,893 --> 00:13:26,568
For an aphrodisiac instead
of his, you know, wing-Dang-Doodle?

194
00:13:26,773 --> 00:13:30,083
But I thought the horn was
the human wing-Dang-Doodle.

195
00:13:30,293 --> 00:13:35,003
No sir, chief. The main event, so to
speak, is downstairs near the wallet.

196
00:13:35,173 --> 00:13:37,733
Ever seen soccer players
line up to block a free kick?

197
00:13:37,893 --> 00:13:41,283
They ain't covering their noses,
I'll tell you that much. Well, see you.

198
00:13:41,493 --> 00:13:46,044
Interesting. The trousers
conceal a tiny secondary horn.

199
00:13:46,253 --> 00:13:49,370
Hey, what have you heard?
Guards, seize him.

200
00:13:49,573 --> 00:13:52,565
Prepare to harvest the lower horn.

201
00:13:55,133 --> 00:13:58,170
Okay, you can have my nose.

202
00:14:04,693 --> 00:14:06,172
Guards.
Yeah?

203
00:14:06,373 --> 00:14:10,127
Remove the human's lower horn
and prepare it to be eaten by me.

204
00:14:10,293 --> 00:14:13,126
In other words, slop a lot
of ketchup and salt on it.

205
00:14:13,293 --> 00:14:16,603
Then bring it to our royal bedchamber
and put it in the sock drawer...

206
00:14:16,773 --> 00:14:21,244
With the other things that have failed
to arouse my passion for this woman.

207
00:14:23,653 --> 00:14:26,326
Remove pants.
Wait. Listen...

208
00:14:26,493 --> 00:14:28,768
I'm usually the first
guy to toot my own horn--

209
00:14:28,933 --> 00:14:30,605
I'll say! Whoo!

210
00:14:30,813 --> 00:14:33,452
But in this case I don't
think it's gonna do any good.

211
00:14:33,653 --> 00:14:36,884
That's what she said! Whoo!

212
00:14:37,093 --> 00:14:39,687
Let's face it. You two have
deep relationship problems...

213
00:14:39,853 --> 00:14:41,764
That can't be solved by an aphrodisiac.

214
00:14:41,973 --> 00:14:43,201
However huge it might be.

215
00:14:43,413 --> 00:14:46,485
So, what do you suggest,
painfully single human?

216
00:14:46,693 --> 00:14:50,242
Why don't you think back to what
brought you together in the first place?

217
00:14:50,453 --> 00:14:54,651
Oh, I don't know.
Lrrr used to be so tender.

218
00:14:54,813 --> 00:14:58,203
I only wrote that poem
to test my printer.

219
00:14:58,413 --> 00:15:00,051
We'd go walking in the woods...

220
00:15:00,213 --> 00:15:04,047
And Lrrr would find injured tinkle
bunnies and nurse them back to health.

221
00:15:04,253 --> 00:15:07,290
Yes, but I'm the one who injured them.
Oh, shush.

222
00:15:07,453 --> 00:15:10,490
You stepped on them by accident
and then you cried all night.

223
00:15:10,653 --> 00:15:13,531
That's the kind of
sensitive man you used to be.

224
00:15:13,733 --> 00:15:17,248
And you used to wear a size 3
cape, but not anymore!

225
00:15:17,453 --> 00:15:21,207
Now, bring me that lower horn
while I'm still in the mood!

226
00:15:22,093 --> 00:15:26,006
What if we got your passion
back without mutilating me?

227
00:15:26,213 --> 00:15:28,329
Yeah. We know a great
place in the mountains.

228
00:15:28,533 --> 00:15:31,411
We could take you there for a
romantic dinner under the stars.

229
00:15:31,613 --> 00:15:35,083
Sounds interesting.
But he would never do it.

230
00:15:35,253 --> 00:15:38,563
Oh, like hell I wouldn't.
I'm not gonna be blamed for not going.

231
00:15:38,773 --> 00:15:40,570
Then it's a deal. We get one night.

232
00:15:40,733 --> 00:15:44,487
I keep my horn as long as you two end
up doing the horizontal monster mash.

233
00:15:46,573 --> 00:15:49,212
Oh! I don't get it.

234
00:15:54,533 --> 00:15:58,765
Bonjour. May I offer you a box
of wine for the edge of the table?

235
00:15:58,973 --> 00:16:02,170
No, thanks. Just water, please.
Tap water.

236
00:16:02,333 --> 00:16:03,891
Oh, big spender.

237
00:16:04,093 --> 00:16:08,291
That's it. This date is over. Waiter.

238
00:16:08,933 --> 00:16:11,891
So, what can I get you this evening?
Your lower horn.

239
00:16:12,213 --> 00:16:16,889
I'll just start you off with some bread.
Some sexy, arousing bread.

240
00:16:17,093 --> 00:16:19,687
Fine. But none of that
whole-Grain goat food.

241
00:16:19,853 --> 00:16:21,650
And bring plenty of melted butter.

242
00:16:21,893 --> 00:16:24,691
Why don't you just inject some fat...

243
00:16:24,853 --> 00:16:27,447
Straight into your ass
and cut out the middleman?

244
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:29,848
One of these days, Ndnd.

245
00:16:30,013 --> 00:16:33,767
Bang. Zoom. Straight to the
third moon of Omicron Persei 8.

246
00:16:40,013 --> 00:16:45,167
Mmm. This jerked chicken is good.
I think I'll have Fry's lower horn jerked.

247
00:16:45,333 --> 00:16:48,006
It's used to it! Whoo!

248
00:16:49,453 --> 00:16:52,013
So how are you two
snoogy-Pookums doing?

249
00:16:52,213 --> 00:16:54,852
Poorly.
My wife is right, for once.

250
00:16:55,013 --> 00:17:00,565
There's very little magic in the air.
Ready the lower horn transport vessel.

251
00:17:03,973 --> 00:17:07,363
Boy, who knew a cooler could
also make a handy wang coffin.

252
00:17:07,533 --> 00:17:10,093
Hey, mind if I stick these in here?
Go for it.

253
00:17:11,693 --> 00:17:15,845
Don't worry, Fry. Things look bad,
but I still have a trump card.

254
00:17:16,013 --> 00:17:18,402
The most beautiful
love song ever written.

255
00:17:31,053 --> 00:17:32,372
The humans are attacking!

256
00:17:32,573 --> 00:17:36,361
Pluck the lower horn and
let's get out of here!

257
00:17:36,693 --> 00:17:39,526
Quick, Fry, run for it.

258
00:17:40,133 --> 00:17:42,522
Oh! Ow! Ow! Ow! Oh! Ah!

259
00:17:42,693 --> 00:17:45,765
Come on, freedom cage.
Roll me to safety!

260
00:17:47,693 --> 00:17:49,092
Ow! Ow!

261
00:17:51,613 --> 00:17:55,845
Yes! I never thought I'd escape
with my doodle, but I pulled it out.

262
00:17:56,013 --> 00:17:59,403
Just like at the movie theater! Whoo!

263
00:17:59,573 --> 00:18:01,291
Give me that.

264
00:18:20,773 --> 00:18:23,162
Bigfoot! He's real. I knew it.

265
00:18:23,373 --> 00:18:26,445
The Loch Ness monster's book was right.

266
00:18:31,373 --> 00:18:35,332
Well, hello there, my furry friend.

267
00:18:35,533 --> 00:18:39,208
Look at his adorable little feet.

268
00:18:45,973 --> 00:18:49,488
Yes, you are a cutie pie.

269
00:18:49,653 --> 00:18:52,292
Holy macaroni!

270
00:18:53,133 --> 00:18:56,648
I can't believe I'm seeing Bigfoot.
And he's in focus.

271
00:18:56,853 --> 00:19:00,163
Oh, I've waited my entire
life for this moment.

272
00:19:01,253 --> 00:19:03,562
What?
What are you doing with that?

273
00:19:03,773 --> 00:19:06,765
You're going to kill
this innocent giganto?

274
00:19:06,973 --> 00:19:09,885
Of course not. I'm just
gonna tranquilize him...

275
00:19:10,053 --> 00:19:12,692
So I can chop off his
feet as proof he exists...

276
00:19:12,853 --> 00:19:16,084
Then dump him back in
the wild. He'll do fine.

277
00:19:16,253 --> 00:19:18,767
You'll have to get through me first.

278
00:19:18,973 --> 00:19:21,487
Okay. Nighty-Night.

279
00:19:23,773 --> 00:19:24,762
Ah!

280
00:19:24,933 --> 00:19:28,528
Now, leave this gentle Sasquatch,
or Wood Ape, in peace...

281
00:19:28,693 --> 00:19:33,164
So I can finally and at long last
harvest this pathetic human's lower horn.

282
00:19:33,333 --> 00:19:34,971
Yeah!

283
00:19:35,133 --> 00:19:37,044
Wait. What am I saying?

284
00:19:37,213 --> 00:19:40,205
If I poach this beast's
lower horn, am I any better...

285
00:19:40,373 --> 00:19:43,570
Than that ranger with
his demented foot lust?

286
00:19:43,733 --> 00:19:47,043
Yes, but not by enough.

287
00:19:48,053 --> 00:19:49,202
Score.

288
00:19:50,533 --> 00:19:54,526
This human's lower horn
is one of God's creatures.

289
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:59,050
A living thing. And all living
things, large and small--

290
00:19:59,213 --> 00:20:01,727
In this case, small! Whoo!

291
00:20:01,933 --> 00:20:06,609
Have dignity and a spark of the divine.

292
00:20:08,413 --> 00:20:13,441
That's the gentle, sensitive
poet warlord I fell in love with.

293
00:20:25,213 --> 00:20:26,885
Oh, yeah

294
00:20:31,093 --> 00:20:35,644
You'll want to retreat to
a safe, 500-Meter radius.

295
00:20:37,133 --> 00:20:40,364
Well, Fry, it looks like you get
to hold on to your lower horn.

296
00:20:40,533 --> 00:20:42,922
As usual! Whoo!

297
00:20:43,133 --> 00:20:45,601
Run away!

298
00:20:45,773 --> 00:20:48,970
There, right there, right there.
Oh, yeah.

299
00:21:04,093 --> 00:21:07,085
You're on a scenic route through
a state recreation area...

300
00:21:07,253 --> 00:21:10,882
Known as the human mind.
You ask a passerby for directions...

301
00:21:11,053 --> 00:21:13,123
Only to find he has
no face or something.

302
00:21:13,293 --> 00:21:15,682
Suddenly up ahead, a door in the road.

303
00:21:15,853 --> 00:21:19,209
You swerve, narrowly
avoiding The Scary Door.

304
00:21:21,333 --> 00:21:24,131
I have combined the DNA of the
world's most evil animals...

305
00:21:24,293 --> 00:21:26,853
To make the most evil
creature of them all.

306
00:21:30,493 --> 00:21:32,927
It turns out it's man.
