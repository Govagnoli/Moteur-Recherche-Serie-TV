1
00:00:07,333 --> 00:00:09,403
Futurama [5x02] - Jurassic Bark - CiWaN

2
00:00:31,493 --> 00:00:36,931
For my next trick,
notice I have nothing up my sleeves...

3
00:00:37,093 --> 00:00:40,290
And nothing in my head.

4
00:00:41,613 --> 00:00:44,286
So if my lovely assistant
will kindly supply me...

5
00:00:44,453 --> 00:00:48,082
With an ordinary,
non-Fake pitcher of milk.

6
00:00:50,653 --> 00:00:53,008
Behold! The milk has vanished!

7
00:00:53,173 --> 00:00:56,131
Exiled, perhaps, to another dimension!

8
00:00:57,653 --> 00:01:00,725
Amazing! That's why they call
you Bender the Magnificent.

9
00:01:00,933 --> 00:01:02,844
No, it isn't.

10
00:01:05,613 --> 00:01:09,367
They discovered an intact 20th-Century
pizzeria, like the one I used to work at!

11
00:01:09,533 --> 00:01:12,764
Interesting. No, wait, the other thing.
Tedious.

12
00:01:12,933 --> 00:01:15,731
Let's check it out. You can see
how I lived before I met you.

13
00:01:15,893 --> 00:01:19,283
You lived before you met me?
Sure. Lots of people did.

14
00:01:19,493 --> 00:01:20,642
Really.

15
00:01:31,653 --> 00:01:35,089
Truly, they were as gods
who built this place.

16
00:01:35,293 --> 00:01:40,287
Next, we come to the splendidly
preserved wooden pizza paddle.

17
00:01:41,693 --> 00:01:47,211
Scientists theorize it was used to
gently discipline the delivery boy.

18
00:01:49,453 --> 00:01:51,569
Wait a second. This is Panucci's!

19
00:01:51,773 --> 00:01:53,889
I used to work in this exact pizzeria.

20
00:01:54,093 --> 00:01:57,802
And for your information, lady, this
was not just used to paddle my butt.

21
00:01:57,973 --> 00:02:00,089
It was also used to move
pizzas and crush rats.

22
00:02:00,293 --> 00:02:02,409
I don't know where you
get your facts, sir...

23
00:02:02,573 --> 00:02:05,804
But I am a volunteer housewife
with 45 minutes of orientation...

24
00:02:05,973 --> 00:02:08,487
And a Harlequin romance
about archeologists.

25
00:02:10,093 --> 00:02:12,049
Don't wave your fancy degrees at me.

26
00:02:12,253 --> 00:02:13,971
I recognize all this stuff.

27
00:02:14,253 --> 00:02:18,087
Petrified sausages, old Mr. Vitelli,
and that's--

28
00:02:24,453 --> 00:02:28,526
Yes?
Pizza delivery for Mr. Seymour Asses?

29
00:02:28,733 --> 00:02:32,203
There's no one by that
name here or anywhere.

30
00:02:32,373 --> 00:02:35,251
I hope that in time you'll
realize what an idiot you've been.

31
00:02:35,453 --> 00:02:36,932
I wouldn't count on that.

32
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:46,928
Poor little guy. You look like
you haven't eaten in a month.

33
00:02:47,373 --> 00:02:51,332
Here. But if Mr. Panucci asks,
your name is Seymour Asses.

34
00:02:53,653 --> 00:02:54,972
I like you, Seymour.

35
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:57,772
You're not constantly judging me,
like all the other dogs.

36
00:02:57,933 --> 00:02:59,605
Are you?

37
00:03:00,253 --> 00:03:03,211
We understand each other.

38
00:03:03,373 --> 00:03:05,603
People think you're just
a mutt who smells bad...

39
00:03:05,773 --> 00:03:07,968
Can't find a girlfriend
and has a crummy job.

40
00:03:08,133 --> 00:03:11,284
But you're keeping it real
and you call no man "Mister. "

41
00:03:13,373 --> 00:03:16,206
Well, goodbye.
Live long and prosper.

42
00:03:24,573 --> 00:03:28,361
That's the least appetizing
calzone I've ever seen.

43
00:03:28,533 --> 00:03:31,764
No! That's my dog in there!
It's an outrage, I say.

44
00:03:34,133 --> 00:03:35,248
Ow! Ow!

45
00:03:35,413 --> 00:03:38,723
I'm taking him home and I'd like
to see anyone try and stop me.

46
00:03:39,493 --> 00:03:41,609
Ow! Oh! Ow! Oh! Ah!

47
00:03:43,653 --> 00:03:45,609
And then he was ejected by the guards.

48
00:03:45,773 --> 00:03:48,162
Needless to say, I was mortified.

49
00:03:48,333 --> 00:03:50,722
Well, it's not right to
make my dead pet an exhibit.

50
00:03:50,893 --> 00:03:53,726
That's like digging up Lassie
and putting her in the Louvre.

51
00:03:53,893 --> 00:03:55,724
Lassie is on display in the Louvre.

52
00:03:55,893 --> 00:03:59,203
I know. I was deliberately
describing a similar situation.

53
00:03:59,413 --> 00:04:02,723
Why don't you try protesting,
like those native Martians.

54
00:04:02,933 --> 00:04:06,892
Always whining that people don't treat
their ancestors' bones with respect.

55
00:04:08,213 --> 00:04:10,010
Protesting never works.

56
00:04:10,213 --> 00:04:12,329
You're right. I'll give it a shot!

57
00:04:14,493 --> 00:04:16,165
What do you want?
Fry's dog!

58
00:04:16,333 --> 00:04:18,483
When do you want it?
Fry's dog!

59
00:04:18,653 --> 00:04:20,371
Yeah!

60
00:04:20,573 --> 00:04:23,133
I will now perform my
people's native dance.

61
00:04:31,893 --> 00:04:33,929
It says here that this
part of The Hustle...

62
00:04:35,293 --> 00:04:38,888
Implores the gods to grant a favor,
usually a Trans Am.

63
00:04:52,213 --> 00:04:55,011
Thattaboy, Seymour.
Right here waiting for me as always.

64
00:04:55,173 --> 00:04:57,243
Just like that huge
mushroom in my shower.

65
00:05:01,413 --> 00:05:03,165
Hey, there's our little mascot.

66
00:05:04,453 --> 00:05:07,763
You been swimming in the sewer again?
You rascal.

67
00:05:12,133 --> 00:05:14,408
Fry, cleanup!
Seymour, cleanup!

68
00:05:16,413 --> 00:05:18,881
Good dog.
That's a good Seymour.

69
00:05:21,413 --> 00:05:23,847
There's dog fur on my slice!

70
00:05:24,053 --> 00:05:27,807
No, that's vermicelli.
No fur in here.

71
00:05:33,453 --> 00:05:34,852
He's so cute.

72
00:05:35,053 --> 00:05:37,487
He can do two things at
one time: eat and swim.

73
00:05:37,653 --> 00:05:39,484
Three things!

74
00:05:44,573 --> 00:05:48,202
Fry, it's been three days.
You can't keep boogying like this.

75
00:05:48,373 --> 00:05:50,284
You'll come down with
a fever of some sort.

76
00:05:50,493 --> 00:05:54,805
I'm Dr. Ben Beeler, the paleontologist
who discovered your dog.

77
00:05:55,093 --> 00:05:57,243
Or as some call it,
the Beelersaurus.

78
00:05:57,453 --> 00:06:00,331
So do I get Seymour back?
Are you caving to political pressure?

79
00:06:00,653 --> 00:06:02,928
No. We're sorry,
but there's just too much...

80
00:06:03,093 --> 00:06:06,085
That fossil can teach us
about dogs from your time.

81
00:06:06,293 --> 00:06:07,806
His name was Seymour.

82
00:06:07,973 --> 00:06:10,931
He was once intimate with the
leg of a wandering saxophonist.

83
00:06:11,093 --> 00:06:13,288
He had wet dog smell, even when dry.

84
00:06:13,453 --> 00:06:16,126
And he was not above
chasing the number 29 bus.

85
00:06:16,333 --> 00:06:17,971
The 29? Lnteresting.

86
00:06:18,133 --> 00:06:19,885
That's all I needed, right?
I'm good.

87
00:06:20,093 --> 00:06:22,607
Okay, then. Here's your dog back.

88
00:06:22,853 --> 00:06:25,003
Seymour!

89
00:06:28,053 --> 00:06:29,566
Lady and gentleman...

90
00:06:29,733 --> 00:06:33,169
How about a hand for my
temporary replacement assistant?

91
00:06:36,333 --> 00:06:38,722
I was all in this part! It's magic!

92
00:06:38,933 --> 00:06:42,721
You're not fit to wear Fry's leotard!

93
00:06:42,933 --> 00:06:44,207
Stop!

94
00:06:44,413 --> 00:06:47,166
Good news, everyone!
Hurray, he's back!

95
00:06:47,333 --> 00:06:50,848
And he's looking for a garbage can to
put the rock in. Here you go, buddy.

96
00:06:51,053 --> 00:06:54,682
No. Actually, we've discovered that
Fry's dog was fast-Fossilized...

97
00:06:54,853 --> 00:06:57,003
Preserving its cellular structure.

98
00:06:57,213 --> 00:07:00,888
Which means we can clone it!
Seymour will live again!

99
00:07:01,293 --> 00:07:03,090
A little land mammal.

100
00:07:03,293 --> 00:07:06,808
Can you believe it, Bender?
I'm gonna have my best friend back!

101
00:07:24,613 --> 00:07:26,331
Why the idiot convention?

102
00:07:26,533 --> 00:07:29,001
Cubert, my precious babe.

103
00:07:29,213 --> 00:07:31,488
I'm going to attempt
to clone Fry's dog...

104
00:07:31,653 --> 00:07:35,282
Using the very same
apparatus I used to clone you.

105
00:07:35,453 --> 00:07:38,923
Look! There's a smidge
of toe still in here.

106
00:07:40,733 --> 00:07:44,362
You see, beneath the fossil's
crunchy mineral shell...

107
00:07:44,533 --> 00:07:47,570
There's still a creamy
core of dog nougat.

108
00:07:47,853 --> 00:07:50,606
So will Seymour remember how
to sing "Walking on Sunshine"?

109
00:07:50,853 --> 00:07:52,252
Amazingly, yes.

110
00:07:52,413 --> 00:07:56,691
In cases of rapid fossilization,
I can press this brain scan button...

111
00:07:56,853 --> 00:08:00,766
Retrieving Seymour's memories at
the precise instant of doggy death.

112
00:08:00,973 --> 00:08:04,329
I'm gonna get my puppy back!
Ln your face, Grim Reaper!

113
00:08:04,533 --> 00:08:06,330
Crappy, ineffective reaper.

114
00:08:06,533 --> 00:08:11,004
I just need to reset the Clone-O-Mat
from human mode to dog mode.

115
00:08:12,053 --> 00:08:13,281
The dog says:

116
00:08:14,773 --> 00:08:17,003
Oh-Oh. This may take a while.

117
00:08:23,533 --> 00:08:25,649
You stink, loser!

118
00:08:25,853 --> 00:08:28,003
Hey, Fry, pizza going out.

119
00:08:28,173 --> 00:08:29,492
Come on!

120
00:08:29,693 --> 00:08:31,490
But I'm celebrating New Year's Eve.

121
00:08:31,693 --> 00:08:33,604
Like you got squat to celebrate.

122
00:08:33,773 --> 00:08:35,684
You're a delivery boy this millennium...

123
00:08:35,853 --> 00:08:38,048
And you'll be a delivery
boy next millennium.

124
00:08:42,853 --> 00:08:45,367
What's with Seymour?
It's like he don't want you to go.

125
00:08:45,533 --> 00:08:47,251
Or he thinks your pants is too short.

126
00:08:47,413 --> 00:08:51,042
Which is crazy, because frankly,
you look fabulous. Now get going!

127
00:08:54,013 --> 00:08:58,131
I won't be gone long, Seymour.
Just wait here till I come back.

128
00:09:08,613 --> 00:09:11,685
Hello? Pizza delivery for...

129
00:09:12,333 --> 00:09:15,211
 "I.C. Wiener"? Oh, crud.

130
00:09:18,133 --> 00:09:21,205
Here's to another lousy millennium.

131
00:09:22,333 --> 00:09:26,326
Five, four, three, two .

132
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:35,211
What the--?

133
00:09:40,533 --> 00:09:43,286
A dog collar, for me?
You shouldn't have.

134
00:09:43,453 --> 00:09:45,648
That's for Seymour.
Oh.

135
00:09:48,853 --> 00:09:50,650
A subscription to the Daily Growl?

136
00:09:50,853 --> 00:09:52,809
That's not a reputable
journal of opinion.

137
00:09:52,973 --> 00:09:56,170
That's for Seymour. I'm getting
everything ready for when he's cloned.

138
00:09:56,333 --> 00:09:57,732
Are you on the junk, Fry?

139
00:09:57,893 --> 00:10:00,453
Why waste time on a creature
of inferior intelligence?

140
00:10:00,653 --> 00:10:03,963
Hey, he was smart. He could fetch.
I can fetch!

141
00:10:07,973 --> 00:10:10,806
He could dig up bones.
Hello? Charlemagne?

142
00:10:12,813 --> 00:10:16,044
Plus, I bet he couldn't create
a laser show with his head.

143
00:10:19,613 --> 00:10:21,763
Look, Bender,
this has nothing to do with you.

144
00:10:21,933 --> 00:10:23,127
That's impossible!

145
00:10:23,293 --> 00:10:27,127
Now if you'll excuse me,
I'm working on Seymour's doghouse.

146
00:10:29,573 --> 00:10:33,202
No one ever asked if Bender would
like to live in a tiny little house.

147
00:10:33,373 --> 00:10:34,726
Not that I would.

148
00:10:34,893 --> 00:10:37,009
A tiny little house
that says "Bender" on it.

149
00:10:38,413 --> 00:10:40,529
Ow!

150
00:10:43,533 --> 00:10:46,843
This is Fry. If you're calling
about the used towels for sale...

151
00:10:47,013 --> 00:10:49,481
They're still available for $45 each.

152
00:10:49,653 --> 00:10:51,803
Phil, it's your father.
Where are you?

153
00:10:51,973 --> 00:10:53,770
You're holding up New Year's brunch.

154
00:10:53,933 --> 00:10:55,525
Your brother can't wait any longer.

155
00:10:55,733 --> 00:10:59,009
Hello, first bologna
of the new millennium.

156
00:11:00,773 --> 00:11:02,968
Here he comes.
That's him and Seymour.

157
00:11:05,493 --> 00:11:07,449
Well, that's weird.
Seymour's here, but--

158
00:11:07,613 --> 00:11:11,447
Go! Go! Touchdown!
But where's Philip?

159
00:11:11,653 --> 00:11:14,406
I'm telling you,
the Y2K computers got him.

160
00:11:14,573 --> 00:11:17,610
We'll face burning
roads, rivers exploding...

161
00:11:17,773 --> 00:11:20,845
Calculators transformed
into Scud missiles.

162
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:22,731
There's nothing we can do.

163
00:11:27,533 --> 00:11:30,525
What's that, Seymour?
You walking on sunshine?

164
00:11:32,733 --> 00:11:36,089
He's trying to tell us something.
Maybe he can lead us to Philip!

165
00:11:37,493 --> 00:11:40,883
Should we follow him?
To our deaths? Negatory.

166
00:11:41,093 --> 00:11:43,846
It's the Y2K trying to
lure us into an ambush.

167
00:11:44,013 --> 00:11:46,322
And I ain't buying it.
Pass the bologna.

168
00:11:57,133 --> 00:11:58,452
Are you gonna be done soon?

169
00:11:58,653 --> 00:12:01,121
Sorry, but we need to
practice hand-To-Hand combat...

170
00:12:01,293 --> 00:12:04,091
In case an enemy knocks the
laser guns out of our hands...

171
00:12:04,253 --> 00:12:06,084
And they slide way across the room.

172
00:12:06,293 --> 00:12:09,330
Could you do it someplace else?
I'm setting up Seymour's dog bed.

173
00:12:09,533 --> 00:12:11,683
Okay.
Ow!

174
00:12:17,053 --> 00:12:18,645
Heel, boy! Heel!

175
00:12:18,813 --> 00:12:21,611
Oh, hello, Fry.
I guess I didn't notice you there.

176
00:12:21,773 --> 00:12:25,209
I'm having such fun with my
new best friend, Robo-Puppy.

177
00:12:25,373 --> 00:12:26,692
That's nice.

178
00:12:26,893 --> 00:12:29,726
I was just out walking him.
Yes, you can walk him.

179
00:12:29,893 --> 00:12:32,851
Of course, after he goes,
you have to refill the canisters.

180
00:12:33,253 --> 00:12:35,130
Come here, boy! Pet, pet, pet.

181
00:12:35,333 --> 00:12:37,164
Robo-Puppy receiving petting.

182
00:12:37,373 --> 00:12:40,171
Bender, are you jealous of Fry's puppy?

183
00:12:40,333 --> 00:12:41,686
That's so adorable!

184
00:12:41,893 --> 00:12:45,806
Jealous? Not when I have
the love of Robo-Puppy here.

185
00:12:45,973 --> 00:12:48,043
Robo-Puppy, lick my cheek.

186
00:12:48,253 --> 00:12:51,370
Robo-Puppy preparing to lick cheek.

187
00:12:51,573 --> 00:12:53,768
Robo-Puppy commencing cheek licking.

188
00:12:53,933 --> 00:12:56,811
Licking in progress.
Licking complete.

189
00:12:56,973 --> 00:13:00,522
Robo-Puppy truly is robot's best friend.

190
00:13:01,013 --> 00:13:02,446
There. Perfect.

191
00:13:05,093 --> 00:13:08,768
Good news, everyone!
The Clone-O-Mat is ready!

192
00:13:11,213 --> 00:13:13,283
Finally!

193
00:13:13,493 --> 00:13:16,769
Robo-Puppy commencing
two-Hour yipping session.

194
00:13:21,933 --> 00:13:25,812
Robo-Puppy mistreatment alert!
Robo-Puppy mistreatment alert!

195
00:13:28,013 --> 00:13:31,688
Behold once more,
the mighty Clone-O-Mat!

196
00:13:31,893 --> 00:13:34,566
Requiring such vast
amounts of electricity...

197
00:13:34,733 --> 00:13:39,523
That we must harness the
elemental power of nature itself!

198
00:13:39,813 --> 00:13:40,882
Wow.

199
00:13:41,173 --> 00:13:46,008
I speak, of course, of molten
lava deep within the Earth's core.

200
00:13:46,173 --> 00:13:48,403
To the subbasement!

201
00:14:03,733 --> 00:14:06,088
Powering up Clone-O-Mat!

202
00:14:06,373 --> 00:14:09,285
Placing fossil on
the Plat-Clone-O-Form.

203
00:14:11,893 --> 00:14:14,248
Initiating dog brain CAT scan!

204
00:14:17,253 --> 00:14:18,891
Come on, boy. Come back to life.

205
00:14:19,173 --> 00:14:23,530
Know ye now what feels
like to be dog god!

206
00:14:24,093 --> 00:14:27,563
Commencing DNA extraction.

207
00:14:33,253 --> 00:14:35,323
Fry, come on!
The talent show.

208
00:14:35,493 --> 00:14:37,290
What? I'm in the middle of something.

209
00:14:37,493 --> 00:14:41,042
But if we don't perform,
in what sense do we have an act?

210
00:14:41,253 --> 00:14:43,084
Bender, enough.
Leave me alone!

211
00:14:43,933 --> 00:14:47,005
So that's how it is?
I thought you were my friend.

212
00:14:47,173 --> 00:14:51,405
But if you love your dog so much,
maybe you'd rather play fetch!

213
00:14:54,173 --> 00:14:55,447
No!

214
00:15:00,653 --> 00:15:03,372
Now I'm all you got!

215
00:15:07,693 --> 00:15:09,684
I hate you! I hate you!

216
00:15:09,853 --> 00:15:13,163
You evil, metal man! Ow!

217
00:15:14,013 --> 00:15:16,652
So anyway, your dog is melted.
Now we're friends again.

218
00:15:16,853 --> 00:15:19,890
Not necessarily.
For the dog may yet survive.

219
00:15:20,093 --> 00:15:21,367
May yet? Really?

220
00:15:21,573 --> 00:15:24,724
Indeed. You see, that fossil
was made of dolomite...

221
00:15:24,893 --> 00:15:29,364
The tough, black mineral that won't
cop out when there's heat all about.

222
00:15:29,573 --> 00:15:34,693
By contrast, observe the
lava's affect on this ice swan.

223
00:15:36,333 --> 00:15:39,530
Of course, that would've
melted even at room temperature.

224
00:15:39,693 --> 00:15:41,126
I just wanted to get rid of it.

225
00:15:41,293 --> 00:15:44,251
But had it been made of that
righteous mineral dolomite...

226
00:15:44,413 --> 00:15:46,927
There's a slim chance
it might have survived.

227
00:15:47,133 --> 00:15:48,885
So Seymour might still exist?

228
00:15:49,053 --> 00:15:52,329
Perhaps, for a few minutes.
It's dolomite, baby!

229
00:15:52,573 --> 00:15:55,451
Then I'm going in after him!

230
00:15:57,613 --> 00:16:00,605
No!
He'd come after me!

231
00:16:43,333 --> 00:16:45,528
Acting like a moron
won't bring your dog back.

232
00:16:45,693 --> 00:16:47,251
Then all hope is lost!

233
00:16:49,853 --> 00:16:52,492
Goodbye, Seymour.

234
00:16:54,653 --> 00:16:56,530
Please stop crying, Fry.

235
00:16:56,693 --> 00:16:58,445
Here.

236
00:16:58,933 --> 00:17:01,766
I assumed you were just
pretending to love the dog...

237
00:17:01,933 --> 00:17:03,651
To toy with my emotions.

238
00:17:03,853 --> 00:17:07,289
What have I done?
You didn't do anything.

239
00:17:07,453 --> 00:17:08,852
Don't beat yourself up.

240
00:17:09,053 --> 00:17:10,566
Fry, I'm sorry.

241
00:17:10,733 --> 00:17:14,123
I should have understood how someone
can love an inferior creature...

242
00:17:14,293 --> 00:17:15,931
Because I love you.

243
00:17:16,093 --> 00:17:19,722
Not in the way of the ancient Greeks,
but the way a robot loves a human...

244
00:17:19,893 --> 00:17:24,205
A human loves a dog,
and occasionally, a gorilla loves a kitty.

245
00:17:24,613 --> 00:17:25,932
I'm going in!

246
00:17:26,133 --> 00:17:29,250
I'm a professor!
Why isn't anyone listening to me?

247
00:17:29,413 --> 00:17:31,369
You can't go in because you'll melt!

248
00:17:31,533 --> 00:17:34,605
The fossil only has a chance
because it's made of dolomite.

249
00:17:34,813 --> 00:17:37,168
I'm 40 percent dolomite!

250
00:17:41,053 --> 00:17:43,886
Oh, it's hot. Oh, it's very hot!

251
00:17:53,853 --> 00:17:56,162
I am one hung-Over cryogenicist.

252
00:17:56,373 --> 00:17:58,762
Throw that mutt in the
freezer till his owners come.

253
00:17:58,933 --> 00:18:01,242
You can't solve all your
problems by freezing them.

254
00:18:01,413 --> 00:18:03,244
I think you're forgetting our motto.

255
00:18:06,933 --> 00:18:09,970
Are you the cryogenicist who
called about our son's dog?

256
00:18:10,173 --> 00:18:13,324
You must be the Frys.
Yeah, he's right over there.

257
00:18:14,453 --> 00:18:17,365
Sorry we're late.
We all got sick from eating bad bologna.

258
00:18:17,533 --> 00:18:19,364
Y2K.

259
00:18:20,973 --> 00:18:22,292
What's he so worked up about?

260
00:18:22,573 --> 00:18:24,803
He's just upset because
our boy's missing.

261
00:18:24,973 --> 00:18:28,648
Come on, you overgrown rat!
Lead us to Philip.

262
00:18:34,333 --> 00:18:36,005
Bender's been down there too long!

263
00:18:36,173 --> 00:18:39,882
I'm going in after him!
Professor! Lava! Hot!

264
00:18:40,133 --> 00:18:41,407
This is all my fault.

265
00:18:41,573 --> 00:18:45,885
I let my best friend risk his
life just to get my dead dog back.

266
00:18:52,613 --> 00:18:55,286
Bender!
And that is why they call me...

267
00:18:55,453 --> 00:18:58,126
Bender the Magnificent!

268
00:18:58,813 --> 00:19:00,246
Hey, where'd everybody go?

269
00:19:02,893 --> 00:19:05,202
Okay, let's clone us some dog.

270
00:19:05,413 --> 00:19:06,971
Yeah!
Very well.

271
00:19:07,133 --> 00:19:10,808
Let this abomination
unto the Lord begin!

272
00:19:16,093 --> 00:19:20,769
Interesting. It seems Seymour
died at the ripe old age of 15.

273
00:19:20,933 --> 00:19:24,846
Fifteen? You mean he lived for
12 more years after I got frozen?

274
00:19:25,013 --> 00:19:26,651
Indeed.

275
00:19:26,813 --> 00:19:28,292
Stop the cloning.

276
00:19:30,933 --> 00:19:34,084
Oh, sure.
Smash the smart guy's machine.

277
00:19:34,293 --> 00:19:36,170
Fry, what's wrong?
Think about it.

278
00:19:36,373 --> 00:19:38,762
Seymour lived a full
life after I was gone.

279
00:19:38,933 --> 00:19:41,288
He probably even added new
songs to his repertoire.

280
00:19:41,493 --> 00:19:44,883
But that's a good thing.
"Walking on Sunshine" sucks noodles.

281
00:19:45,093 --> 00:19:46,970
I had Seymour till he was 3.

282
00:19:47,133 --> 00:19:49,693
That's when I knew him and
that's when I loved him.

283
00:19:51,253 --> 00:19:52,811
I'll never forget him.

284
00:19:52,973 --> 00:19:56,488
But he forgot me a long, long time ago.

285
00:20:40,133 --> 00:20:41,612
Ow!
