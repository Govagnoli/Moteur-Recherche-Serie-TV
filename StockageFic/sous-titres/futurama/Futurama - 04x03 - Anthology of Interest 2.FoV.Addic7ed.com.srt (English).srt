Futurama [4x03] - Anthology of Interest 2 - CiWaN

2
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:39,669
There. I've finished
fine-Tuning my What If Machine.

3
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:45,273
It can answer any "What if," accurate
to one-Tenth of a plausibility unit.

4
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:47,391
That's so plausible!

5
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,478
Who wants to see an alternate reality?

6
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:54,275
I want to know what would
happen if I were human.

7
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:58,314
Being a robot's great,
but we don't have emotions...

8
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:00,551
And sometimes that makes me very sad.

9
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:08,308
Oh, Lordy Lou, there he goes again!
Well, let's give baby what he wants.

10
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:11,877
What if Bender were human?

11
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:20,837
Good news! I've invented a way
to turn Bender into a human...

12
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:24,589
Using the process I call
reverse fossilization.

13
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:26,028
How does it work?

14
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:30,313
In regular fossilization,
flesh and bone turn to minerals.

15
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:34,195
Realizing that, it was
simple to reverse the process.

16
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:38,678
I've already tested it by turning
the toaster into a raccoon.

17
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:43,712
Kind of gamy.

18
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:44,989
Ready, Bender?

19
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:49,472
I don't know. I'm beginning
to have some second thoughts...

20
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:04,351
Cover your shame, mon!

21
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:11,959
It worked! Eat it, everyone
who's never won a Nobel Prize!

22
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:14,430
And that includes you, Amy.

23
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:20,192
So this is a human body, huh? Neat!
Hey! My antenna's gone!

24
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:24,433
Nah, it just moved. I'm not getting
good reception on it, though.

25
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,631
Maybe if I wiggle it around...

26
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,956
No! You'll make God cry!

27
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:33,233
Well, let's see what kind
of things this body can do.

28
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:39,119
Hey, that's pretty fun!
Being human is great!

29
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,833
Hooray! It's just like Mardi Gras.

30
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:50,199
Come into the bathroom and look at this!

31
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,992
You won't believe it!

32
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:56,079
Bender, it's okay to be proud,
but don't be a showoff.

33
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,272
You look a lot better than you used to.

34
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,472
You're not so bad yourself, big boy.

35
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:10,157
Hey, that felt great!
Nah, it's not working anymore.

36
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,873
Speak for yourself.

37
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:20,038
Whoa, this is awesome!

38
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:24,791
You drank and smoked as a robot.
But now it's bad for me! Woo!

39
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,560
Speaking of which, try these nachos.

40
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:37,668
Why didn't anyone tell me
tasting things tasted so good?

41
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:46,880
What's going on? That rhythm, it's
doing something to my human butt!

42
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:56,755
Bender, part of being human
is having self-Control.

43
00:03:56,960 --> 00:04:01,272
I bet I can eat nachos and go
to the bathroom at the same time!

44
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:02,959
No, Bender!
Stop him!

45
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,479
Just let me go!
No!

46
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:07,319
Come, Bender.
It's time to go home and rest.

47
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:12,548
I need you in top shape when I present
you to the Nobel Prize Committee.

48
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:13,954
Bender?

49
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:17,279
Goodbye moderation!

50
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:47,636
Is Bender still missing for a week?
Where is he?

51
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:52,472
As I've said before,
I used reverse fossilization...

52
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:56,468
Which is the reverse
of regular, uh, eh...

53
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:57,994
We found him!

54
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:03,354
Ah! Then without further stalling for
time, I present to the Nobel judges...

55
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:08,076
The first robot ever
turned into a human!

56
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:17,634
My God! He needs medical attention!

57
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:24,275
Pulse, 300. Liver, failing.
Cholesterol, 40?

58
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:27,830
Well, that's not so bad.
No, I mean 40 pounds!

59
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:32,479
This scientific breakthrough...

60
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:36,235
Heralds a new dawn in
human-Robot relations. Yes.

61
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:40,318
Come here and give old Bender a kiss.

62
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:47,110
Hey, you like grilled cheese?

63
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:52,913
And, uh, that's why I believe
I deserve the Nobel Prize.

64
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,953
Not only do you not
deserve a Nobel Prize...

65
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:59,112
For loosing this
man-Ball upon the world...

66
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:03,472
But you are hereby kicked
out of the Academy of Science!

67
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:11,389
Wait! As men of science,
are not your minds open to new ideas?

68
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:18,114
I say, do not judge me until you have
tried my way of life for yourselves.

69
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:27,113
Young man, you've opened our minds and
swayed our hearts. Let us therefore...

70
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:29,709
Party!

71
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,149
Hey, everybody!

72
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,273
Party!
Woo-Hoo!

73
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:36,675
Party!

74
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,192
Bender, you were right.

75
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:54,472
You've lived more in one
week of being human...

76
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,871
Than the rest of us
have in our entire lives.

77
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,115
Woo!

78
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:02,511
And so, to recognize
your achievements...

79
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:09,154
I hereby award you the Nobel
Prize in, uh, Chemistry.

80
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,990
Care to say a few words?

81
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,549
He's dead.

82
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,912
When did he die?

83
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:23,550
About twelve hours ago
when the party started.

84
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:25,239
But he just said "Woo!"

85
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:29,069
No, that was air escaping
from the folds of his fat.

86
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,269
Woo!

87
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:39,235
Good night, sweet prince. You were the
greatest man any of us will ever know.

88
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:44,070
Let's get him out of here.
He's starting to smell up the joint.

89
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:46,433
Woo!

90
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:50,830
Woo! Woo!

91
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:56,279
<i>You watched it. You can't
un-Watch it. Stay tuned for more</i>

92
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:59,557
<i>Tales of Interest.</i>

93
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:09,795
Who else has a question for the What
If Machine? Scruffy? Katrina? Xanfor?

94
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,436
I'm good at video games
and bad at everything else.

95
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,114
I wish life was like a video game.

96
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:18,709
Can you say that as a question?

97
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:21,196
What if that thing I said?

98
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:27,190
Oh, great machine, we beseech thee.

99
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:31,672
What if life were
more like a video game?

100
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:45,716
<i>Hello, ignorant pigs. Drop your
crack pipes and your beer bongs...</i>

101
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:49,077
<i>And watch as I sign
an historic peace accord</i>

102
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:53,068
<i>With Ambassador Kong
of Planet Nintendu 64.</i>

103
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:56,670
Wait. I know that monkey!
His name is Donkey!

104
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:00,031
Monkeys aren't donkeys.
Quit messing with my head!

105
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:04,358
I'll just put the old
John Q. Nixon on it.

106
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:10,638
There. No major crap-Ups.
You're on, Mr. Ambassador.

107
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,079
What the...?

108
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:28,952
Mama Mia! The cruel meatball of
war has rolled onto our laps...

109
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:31,674
And ruined our white pants of peace!

110
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:41,195
Mr. Fry, you know the secrets
of the video game "Chance."

111
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,072
Step into the War Room.

112
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:49,672
You're meeting with
General Colin Packman.

113
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:53,873
What can you tell us
about the Nintendians?

114
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,469
I spent all of ninth
grade studying them...

115
00:09:56,680 --> 00:10:01,071
Except the day my eyeballs started
to bleed, and in my opinion...

116
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:05,240
Quickly! To the escape tunnels.

117
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:13,112
This way, damn it!

118
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:19,915
Delicious!
Just like stale marshmallows!

119
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:23,391
And a cherry!

120
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,239
Hey, watch out!

121
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:35,673
Uh-Oh!
Oh, my God! He ate Fry! Fry is dead!

122
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:39,190
It's okay! I had another guy!
Hooray!

123
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:57,149
Invaders, possibly from space!

124
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:03,115
People of Earth, I am Lrrr
of the Planet Nintendu 64.

125
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:07,279
Tremble in fear at our three
different kinds of ships.

126
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:12,873
All right. It's Saturday night. I have
no date, a two-Liter bottle of Shasta

127
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:16,556
And my all-Rush mix tape.
Let's rock!

128
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:30,633
We're losing ships. What should I do?

129
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:34,594
Increase speed, drop down
and reverse direction!

130
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:40,632
I've still got a trick
or two up my sleeve.

131
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:44,230
Watch as I fire upwards
through our own shield!

132
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:48,109
He's a madman! A madman!

133
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:57,799
It's working! Victory's assured!

134
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:01,476
My retirement tomorrow
will be all the sweeter!

135
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,879
I'm hit! So cold.

136
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:08,909
No!

137
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:11,950
Amy, tend to the Widow Packman.

138
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:19,880
Drop down and increase speed!

139
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:24,074
One ship is left only!

140
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:27,272
Come on, Fry! Get it!
It's moving too fast!

141
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:32,071
I could never get the last one!
My brother always got it for me!

142
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:40,956
Drop down! Reverse direction!
Prepare for landing!

143
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:54,319
You are defeated!

144
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:59,913
Instead of shooting where I was, you
should have shot where I was going!

145
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:06,478
All your base are belong to us.

146
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:14,678
What do you monsters want?
One thing, and one thing only:

147
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:20,677
Quarters! A million allowances worth
of quarters! No slugs or tokens!

148
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:21,995
Fork them over!

149
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:27,035
Forget it, you pixelated pirates!
We need quarters to do our laundry!

150
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,229
Yeah!
Right on!

151
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:31,716
But space invaders
need to do laundry, too.

152
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:35,919
Look at Donkey Kong.
Have you smelled his loincloth?

153
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,712
Yes.
Go away!

154
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:40,633
We're not giving you our quarters!

155
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:45,118
What if we put our laundry in
with yours? Would that be okay?

156
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:47,914
I guess so.
Okay, that settles that.

157
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:52,039
But if this cape shrinks,
consider your species extinct!

158
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:57,719
<i>Bravo! That'll be hard
to top! I pity the next...</i>

159
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:01,350
<i>Tale of Interest!</i>

160
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:09,873
Well, there's time
for one last question.

161
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:14,073
Let's turn to the Who Asked
Machine to see who's next.

162
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:17,030
<i>Um, uh...</i>

163
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:18,269
<i>Amy.</i>

164
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:20,912
<i>I mean Leela.</i>

165
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:24,675
As an alien who was
abandoned on Earth...

166
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:27,394
I've never really belonged anywhere.

167
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,033
Boo-Hoo!

168
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,589
Ow!

169
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:36,477
So my question is this:
What if I found my true home?

170
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,429
Ow!

171
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:49,629
Where are we?

172
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:08,918
Nibbler, I don't think we're
in New New York anymore.

173
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:17,315
Jeez, apparently the phrase "Tone it
down" doesn't exist on this planet.

174
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:23,954
Oh, no! We hit someone!
Quick, back into the ship! Nice boots.

175
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:25,835
Yuck!

176
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:29,589
Look, everyone!
She killed the Man-Witch of the West!

177
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:34,555
A witch? That explains how these
boots magically appeared on my feet!

178
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:37,274
No, you stole them. We saw you!

179
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:40,472
Well, it's hard to
find shoes that fit me.

180
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:45,196
Who are you people? Haven't I seen
you in some copyrighted movie?

181
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:51,748
<i>We resemble but are legally distinct
from the Lollypop Guild, the Lollypop...</i>

182
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:02,152
Greetings!
I'm the Cute Witch of the North!

183
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:04,874
Can anyone fix my ship so I can go?

184
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,559
Ask the Professor.

185
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:11,231
He lives in the Emerald Laboratory
down Martin Luther King Boulevard.

186
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:15,877
You mean that Yellow Brick Road?
The city council re-Named it in 1975.

187
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:19,277
Those are great shoes!
Oh, thank you.

188
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:22,074
Do they come in women's sizes?

189
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:32,759
Crow, prepare to be scared.

190
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,989
"Then, the car honked its own horn!"

191
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:41,591
A talking scarecrow. Want to
come with us to see the Professor?

192
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:45,679
He might give you a brain.
Hey! That's not nice to say.

193
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:48,878
Beer! Beer!

194
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:50,638
Whiskey okay?

195
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:58,795
Are you off to see the Professor?
'Cause I could use a heart.

196
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:03,391
A human heart. I need to pump a
lot of blood out of my basement.

197
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:05,915
And I'm the other guy. Courage.

198
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:09,669
Not enough of it.
Need some from what's-His-Name.

199
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:14,231
Damn this DSL!

200
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,675
Fly, my stupids! Fly out and get them!

201
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:24,997
You promised you'd
bake monkey cake today!

202
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:28,590
By "monkey cake," I meant your ass!

203
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:37,870
We've been skipping for hours.
I need to pull over and take "The Wiz."

204
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:44,157
What, do I smell or something? Oh.

205
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:49,397
Why'd you bring us here?
Why'd I have to take a cab?

206
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:53,428
Here's why I brought you,
you twice-Baked barf bags!

207
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:58,873
I've always wanted a daughter to love.
You want to get adopted, you skank?

208
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:05,030
Live here and be a witch like you?
Yeah. As long as I get to hurt people...

209
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:07,390
And not just dance at the equinox.

210
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:11,798
Absolutely.
Oh, Mommy! I found my true home!

211
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:17,470
That's great, Leela!
I've heard worse excuses to drink.

212
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:19,989
I'm melting! Oh!

213
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:26,031
Who would have thought a small amount
of liquid would ever fall on me?

214
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:31,394
Well, no point letting her go to waste.

215
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:41,440
Yes?
We're here to see the Professor.

216
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:46,191
No one sees the mighty Professor!
Who's there? Visitors?

217
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:50,479
I want to see them!
It's nobody! Now, sign that will.

218
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:53,831
He's not here.
Oh, for the love of Benji.

219
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:06,155
I am the Professor!
Great and, uh, forgetful!

220
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:11,954
Now, what do you nice kids want?

221
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:16,950
Nothing! But if you have extra courage,
I'd haul it away for you maybe?

222
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:21,676
Oh, blithery poop, my cowardly
lobster! You don't need courage.

223
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:27,193
After all, who needs
courage when you have a gun?

224
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:31,680
Now, world. You put your hands up!

225
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:36,556
Lad, all you need is a brain.
Why does everyone keep saying that?

226
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:41,872
This is a stickup!
Give me the bag, old man!

227
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:47,552
Here you go, my friend.
5000 Professor Land fun bucks!

228
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:54,319
Oh, crap.
You want to go home, right?

229
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:58,115
No. Not anymore.
I want to be the new Wicked Witch.

230
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:02,598
Nonsense. Click your big honking
boots together three times...

231
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,870
And wish to go home to Kansas...

232
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:09,312
To live with your dirt-Farming,
teetotaling aunt and uncle.

233
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:12,159
Uh, all right. Here I go.

234
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:19,110
There's no place like...
I want to be a witch!

235
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:30,952
Oh, no! Help! What's happening?

236
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:36,029
Uh, sorry. I think there's a
problem with your upstairs toilet.

237
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:41,394
Wake up!

238
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:45,518
Are you all right?
You got hit on the head.

239
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:48,075
I was having a wonderful dream.

240
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:51,551
Except you were there.
And you. And you.

241
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,637
Never mind, she came to.

242
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:58,391
Oh, so close.
There's always next year.

243
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:01,990
There's always next year.
