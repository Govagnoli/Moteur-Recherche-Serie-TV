1
00:00:34,709 --> 00:00:37,303
Shatner's log, airdate unknown.

2
00:00:37,469 --> 00:00:39,380
The impossible has happened.

3
00:00:39,549 --> 00:00:44,384
It would take days to recount the
events I've witnessed, so settle in.

4
00:00:44,549 --> 00:00:45,868
It all began--

5
00:00:46,029 --> 00:00:48,748
Quiet, you! This court-Martial
is now in session.

6
00:00:48,909 --> 00:00:52,185
The honorably sexy
Zapp Brannigan residing.

7
00:00:52,349 --> 00:00:54,226
Bring in the accused!

8
00:00:56,589 --> 00:00:57,988
Oh, my.

9
00:00:58,149 --> 00:01:01,027
Philip J. Fry, you stand
accused of traveling...

10
00:01:01,189 --> 00:01:03,339
To the forbidden planet Omega 3...

11
00:01:03,509 --> 00:01:06,581
A crime punishable by 12
concurrent death sentences.

12
00:01:06,749 --> 00:01:08,262
Do you understand the charges?

13
00:01:08,429 --> 00:01:11,341
One beep for yes, two beeps for no.

14
00:01:12,309 --> 00:01:14,698
Yes. So noted. Do you plead guilty?

15
00:01:17,469 --> 00:01:21,542
Double yes. Guilty! I will now
carry out the sentence. Kif, my gun.

16
00:01:21,709 --> 00:01:23,665
Wait! He pled not guilty!

17
00:01:23,829 --> 00:01:25,706
Order! Order in the court!

18
00:01:25,869 --> 00:01:30,624
Very well then, Mr. Fry. Please recount
the events that led you to be guilty.

19
00:01:38,549 --> 00:01:42,019
The professor said he was taking a nap,
so we have time for six movies.

20
00:01:42,189 --> 00:01:45,067
Let's take these six Jim Carrey
movies and record over them!

21
00:01:45,229 --> 00:01:47,538
You know what six movies
average out to be good?

22
00:01:47,709 --> 00:01:49,461
The first six Star Trek movies!

23
00:01:51,109 --> 00:01:53,179
Everybody hit the deck!

24
00:01:53,389 --> 00:01:55,459
Shh! Those words are forbidden.

25
00:01:55,629 --> 00:01:57,142
What words? Star Trek?

26
00:01:58,309 --> 00:01:59,662
Shh!
Shut your gills!

27
00:02:00,989 --> 00:02:03,708
That sound, it's patrol car 718!
Hide him!

28
00:02:13,669 --> 00:02:15,102
The court is intrigued.

29
00:02:15,269 --> 00:02:17,863
Perhaps we could hear more
about these forbidden words...

30
00:02:18,029 --> 00:02:21,385
From someone with a
sexily seductive voice.

31
00:02:21,589 --> 00:02:25,502
With pleasure. You see, the show
was banned after the Star Trek Wars.

32
00:02:25,669 --> 00:02:27,978
You mean the vast
migration of Star Wars fans?

33
00:02:28,149 --> 00:02:31,425
No. That was the Star Wars Trek.

34
00:02:32,709 --> 00:02:36,224
By the 23rd century,
Star Trek fandom had evolved...

35
00:02:36,429 --> 00:02:40,741
From a loose association of nerds with
skin problems into a full-Blown religion.

36
00:02:42,069 --> 00:02:44,503
And Scotty beamed them
to the Klingon ship...

37
00:02:44,669 --> 00:02:47,103
Where they would be no tribble at all.

38
00:02:47,269 --> 00:02:49,942
All power to the engines.

39
00:02:50,109 --> 00:02:52,225
As countries fell under its influence...

40
00:02:53,549 --> 00:02:56,302
World leaders were threatened
by the movement's power.

41
00:02:56,629 --> 00:03:01,498
And so the Trekkies were executed
in the manner most befitting virgins.

42
00:03:01,669 --> 00:03:03,500
He's dead, Jim.

43
00:03:03,669 --> 00:03:05,182
He's dead, Jim.

44
00:03:05,509 --> 00:03:06,783
He's dead, Jim.

45
00:03:06,949 --> 00:03:09,782
Finally, the sacred texts were banned.

46
00:03:11,549 --> 00:03:15,622
The last copies of the 79 episodes
and six movies were dumped...

47
00:03:15,789 --> 00:03:18,462
On the forbidden world Omega 3...

48
00:03:18,629 --> 00:03:22,178
Along with that blooper reel where
the door doesn’t close all the way.

49
00:03:23,349 --> 00:03:26,341
Thus, Star Trek was forever
scoured from human memory.

50
00:03:26,509 --> 00:03:30,263
Another classic science-Fiction
show cancelled before its time.

51
00:03:31,589 --> 00:03:34,387
I've never heard of such a
brutal and shocking injustice...

52
00:03:34,549 --> 00:03:37,143
That I cared so little about.
Next witness!

53
00:03:37,309 --> 00:03:40,062
Bender the Robot, please take the stand.

54
00:03:41,149 --> 00:03:43,709
She's all yours, buddy.

55
00:03:43,869 --> 00:03:48,818
I'd only met the defendant, Fry,
once, but I knew he was up to no good.

56
00:03:48,989 --> 00:03:50,342
Please use the beeps.

57
00:03:50,589 --> 00:03:51,942
Oh.

58
00:03:56,229 --> 00:03:59,301
Mr. Nimoy! I came as soon as I heard
what happened centuries ago.

59
00:03:59,469 --> 00:04:01,221
I can't believe your show was banned!

60
00:04:01,389 --> 00:04:04,699
I have absolutely no idea
what you're talking about.

61
00:04:06,909 --> 00:04:11,937
You know, 1966?
79 episodes, about 30 good ones.

62
00:04:12,109 --> 00:04:15,784
Oh, really! I've done too many things
to remember one particular TV series...

63
00:04:15,949 --> 00:04:18,338
But if you want to discuss
my books of poetry--

64
00:04:18,509 --> 00:04:22,184
Remember that episode where you got
high on spores and smacked Kirk around?

65
00:04:22,349 --> 00:04:25,261
No. Perhaps you're thinking
of my one-Man show...

66
00:04:25,429 --> 00:04:28,785
About Vincent van Spock?
I mean, van Gogh. Damn!

67
00:04:28,949 --> 00:04:30,860
Aha! You can't escape it!

68
00:04:31,029 --> 00:04:34,863
Oh, you're right, I can't.

69
00:04:36,189 --> 00:04:38,783
Uh. Jeez, don't get upset.

70
00:04:38,949 --> 00:04:40,905
I mean, okay,
I outwitted you, but--

71
00:04:41,069 --> 00:04:46,939
No, it's my fellow cast members.
300 years ago, they left Earth behind.

72
00:04:50,629 --> 00:04:53,939
This planet doesn't
appreciate us anymore, Leonard.

73
00:04:54,109 --> 00:04:58,148
Bill, you are and always
shall be my friend.

74
00:04:58,309 --> 00:05:00,823
But I just signed a six-Month
lease on my apartment.

75
00:05:00,989 --> 00:05:03,378
I can't walk away from
a commitment like that.

76
00:05:03,549 --> 00:05:05,141
Farewell, my friend.

77
00:05:05,869 --> 00:05:06,858
Oh.

78
00:05:16,069 --> 00:05:19,141
Why did the world turn its
back on our obvious greatness?

79
00:05:19,309 --> 00:05:21,504
I'm literally angry with rage!

80
00:05:21,669 --> 00:05:25,184
Your co-Stars may be gone, but we can
still get those episode tapes back...

81
00:05:25,349 --> 00:05:27,738
For the whole world to see! Come on!
Oh.

82
00:05:28,349 --> 00:05:30,385
Yes! Front row!

83
00:05:35,709 --> 00:05:39,384
You can't go to Omega 3.
It's forbidden. I forbid you!

84
00:05:39,549 --> 00:05:43,144
We have to! The world needs Star Trek
to give people hope for the future.

85
00:05:43,309 --> 00:05:45,459
But it's set 800 years in the past.

86
00:05:45,629 --> 00:05:47,506
Yeah! Why is this so important to you?

87
00:05:47,669 --> 00:05:49,546
'Cause it taught me so much.

88
00:05:49,709 --> 00:05:53,782
Like how you should accept people,
whether they be black, white...

89
00:05:53,949 --> 00:05:55,621
Klingon, or even female.

90
00:05:55,789 --> 00:05:58,747
But most importantly,
when I didn't have any friends...

91
00:05:58,909 --> 00:06:01,218
It made me feel like maybe I did.

92
00:06:01,389 --> 00:06:06,224
Well, that is touchingly pathetic.
I guess I can't let you go alone.

93
00:06:06,389 --> 00:06:09,620
I'll go too. With Leonard's
permission, of course.

94
00:06:14,789 --> 00:06:16,859
We're entering the Omega System.

95
00:06:17,029 --> 00:06:19,907
Warning.
You are now in forbidden space.

96
00:06:20,069 --> 00:06:21,866
Forbidden, schmur-Schmidden.

97
00:06:22,029 --> 00:06:25,783
What are they gonna do, write a letter?
I'm so scared!

98
00:06:26,189 --> 00:06:27,588
I've lost control of the ship!

99
00:06:43,669 --> 00:06:44,988
Oh, dip!

100
00:06:45,149 --> 00:06:46,548
Dip, indeed.

101
00:06:51,989 --> 00:06:53,980
It's all stuff from that forbidden show.

102
00:06:54,149 --> 00:06:58,859
So many cardboard sets, so many
memories. If only the others--

103
00:06:59,029 --> 00:07:01,099
I guess that's my cue.

104
00:07:01,789 --> 00:07:03,825
Bill!
L-Dog!

105
00:07:03,989 --> 00:07:05,786
Hey! This is wonderful!
Oh, man!

106
00:07:05,949 --> 00:07:09,225
I feel like hugging you.
Well, I would, except you have no body.

107
00:07:09,389 --> 00:07:10,663
And we're both men.

108
00:07:12,429 --> 00:07:15,501
Nichelle! George! Walter!

109
00:07:15,669 --> 00:07:19,105
DeForest! Welshie!
Welshie?

110
00:07:19,309 --> 00:07:22,301
We did some musical reunion
specials in the 2200s.

111
00:07:22,469 --> 00:07:24,937
But the guy who played
Scotty had trouble yodeling.

112
00:07:25,109 --> 00:07:30,058
Ever since then, Welshie has been
a welcome participant in our escapades.

113
00:07:32,589 --> 00:07:34,978
I can't believe it!
How'd you all end up here?

114
00:07:35,149 --> 00:07:38,858
We were going to Welshie's cousin's
house to stay in the guest room...

115
00:07:39,029 --> 00:07:43,022
When our ship was pulled down to this
planet and crashed, just like yours.

116
00:07:44,549 --> 00:07:47,109
When we woke up, we had bodies.
Say it in Russian.

117
00:07:48,709 --> 00:07:51,746
Ven vee voke up,
vee had these wah-Dies.

118
00:07:51,989 --> 00:07:54,822
Now say "nuclear wessels"!
No!

119
00:07:54,989 --> 00:07:58,948
We love it here. Everything is
provided for us and we never age.

120
00:07:59,109 --> 00:08:01,065
Check out these abs.

121
00:08:01,389 --> 00:08:03,744
Yowsa!
But who's doing all this for you?

122
00:08:03,909 --> 00:08:05,547
You know, we never thought about it.

123
00:08:05,709 --> 00:08:08,064
We're famous, we're used
to this sort of treatment.

124
00:08:08,229 --> 00:08:09,981
It is I!

125
00:08:11,269 --> 00:08:13,305
Whoa! What a cheesy effect!

126
00:08:13,469 --> 00:08:14,868
I'm not an effect!

127
00:08:15,029 --> 00:08:17,748
You doubt my power?
I do!

128
00:08:18,429 --> 00:08:20,147
Aye!

129
00:08:22,549 --> 00:08:25,905
Welshie!

130
00:08:32,909 --> 00:08:36,379
This court will now hear
some very sensual testimony...

131
00:08:36,549 --> 00:08:39,382
From this court's ex-Lover,
Turanga Leela.

132
00:08:39,549 --> 00:08:41,426
Go * * * * yourself.

133
00:08:43,389 --> 00:08:48,338
Behold, another power!
Different from the one you saw earlier.

134
00:08:51,149 --> 00:08:56,906
Hey! A body! Buff, tan.
Yeah, this is mine, all right.

135
00:08:57,069 --> 00:08:58,707
All right, you gas, what's the deal?

136
00:08:58,869 --> 00:09:03,147
Centuries ago, the videotaped
adventures of the Enterprise crew...

137
00:09:03,309 --> 00:09:05,903
Rained down upon my planet.

138
00:09:06,069 --> 00:09:08,264
Over and over, I watched them.

139
00:09:08,429 --> 00:09:10,989
Especially the five
with the energy beings.

140
00:09:11,149 --> 00:09:15,904
I am Melllvar, Seer of the Tapes!
Knower of the Episodes!

141
00:09:16,069 --> 00:09:19,744
Tremble before my encyclopedic
knowledge of Star Trek!

142
00:09:19,909 --> 00:09:23,618
Tremble? I laugh. Nobody knows
more about Star Trek than me!

143
00:09:23,789 --> 00:09:25,302
I beg to differ!

144
00:09:26,909 --> 00:09:32,620
Long have I waited for the one who
played Spock. At last, we can begin.

145
00:09:34,589 --> 00:09:36,466
Cool! A Star Trek convention!

146
00:09:36,629 --> 00:09:40,941
Melllvar, can you give us some idea
how long this is going to last?

147
00:09:41,109 --> 00:09:42,303
Until time stops.

148
00:09:42,549 --> 00:09:43,868
What?
You can't do this!

149
00:09:44,029 --> 00:09:46,179
Now, we have a full schedule of events.

150
00:09:46,349 --> 00:09:49,546
Can people who hate Star Trek leave?
Good question.

151
00:09:49,709 --> 00:09:53,099
No, you have to stay even longer!
Oh!

152
00:09:55,989 --> 00:09:59,982
Sign it to Melllvar.
Melllvar has three L's.

153
00:10:00,149 --> 00:10:04,142
I think I've done enough conventions
to know how to spell Melllvar.

154
00:10:05,789 --> 00:10:08,542
Say "nerd"!
Nerd!

155
00:10:09,429 --> 00:10:14,219
I'm Slim Shady.
Yes, I'm the real Shady.

156
00:10:14,389 --> 00:10:17,540
All you other Slim Shadys
are just imitating.

157
00:10:17,709 --> 00:10:21,861
So won't the real Slim
Shady please stand up?

158
00:10:22,029 --> 00:10:24,589
Please stand up? Please stand up?

159
00:10:24,749 --> 00:10:27,900
How can you do a spoken
word version of a rap song?

160
00:10:28,069 --> 00:10:29,900
He found a way.

161
00:10:30,069 --> 00:10:34,381
For 100 quatloos, who did the
captain maroon on Ceti Alpha V?

162
00:10:34,549 --> 00:10:36,301
Khan!

163
00:10:37,749 --> 00:10:39,467
Uh, Khan?
Correct!

164
00:10:39,629 --> 00:10:42,462
My button has broken!
The trivia contest has ended.

165
00:10:42,629 --> 00:10:44,108
I now have a surprise.

166
00:10:44,269 --> 00:10:49,024
You will perform a fan script
written by the ultimate Trek fan!

167
00:10:49,189 --> 00:10:50,622
You have my fan script?

168
00:10:50,789 --> 00:10:52,984
I meant me! Melllvar's the ultimate fan!

169
00:10:53,149 --> 00:10:56,585
Oh, I was confused because the
scoreboard says something different.

170
00:10:56,749 --> 00:11:02,221
Trivia contest over! Take your scripts!
We have limited rehearsal time.

171
00:11:02,389 --> 00:11:04,857
Now, I didn't make enough
copies of the script...

172
00:11:05,029 --> 00:11:07,623
So George and Walter will have to share.

173
00:11:07,829 --> 00:11:12,380
You probably don't want us to see you
rehearsing, or it'll give away the ending.

174
00:11:12,549 --> 00:11:14,858
That's right!
The ending must not be ruined!

175
00:11:15,029 --> 00:11:16,667
We'll go wait in the ship.
Okay.

176
00:11:16,829 --> 00:11:19,423
Not till I get my 600 quatloos!

177
00:11:22,749 --> 00:11:25,183
This is wrong. We shouldn't
have abandoned them there.

178
00:11:25,349 --> 00:11:27,146
I'm feeling pretty good about it.

179
00:11:27,309 --> 00:11:30,381
I didn't want to leave them either,
but what were we supposed to do?

180
00:11:30,549 --> 00:11:33,746
Usually on the show, someone would
come up with a complicated plan...

181
00:11:33,909 --> 00:11:35,820
Then explain it with a simple analogy.

182
00:11:36,069 --> 00:11:39,778
Hmm. If we can re-Route engine
power through the primary weapons...

183
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:42,258
And reconfigure them to
Melllvar's frequency...

184
00:11:42,429 --> 00:11:44,897
That should overload his
electro-Quantum structure.

185
00:11:45,069 --> 00:11:47,185
Like putting too much air in a balloon!

186
00:11:47,349 --> 00:11:49,385
Of course! It's so simple!

187
00:11:52,789 --> 00:11:58,182
Alas, my ship, whom I love
like a woman, is disabled.

188
00:11:58,349 --> 00:11:59,668
Oh, Lord.

189
00:11:59,829 --> 00:12:04,107
Fascinating, captain, and logical too.
Yet, we need some help.

190
00:12:04,269 --> 00:12:07,545
Look, captain! Melllvar will help us.

191
00:12:10,909 --> 00:12:14,026
Captain, I wope he will welp our vessel.

192
00:12:14,189 --> 00:12:15,747
Wessel!

193
00:12:15,909 --> 00:12:17,547
You're not acting hard enough!

194
00:12:17,709 --> 00:12:19,825
Melllvar, you have to
respect your actors.

195
00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:23,061
When I directed Star Trek IV,
I got a magnificent performance...

196
00:12:23,229 --> 00:12:25,106
Out of Bill because I respected him.

197
00:12:25,269 --> 00:12:28,898
And when I directed Star Trek V, I got
a magnificent performance out of me...

198
00:12:29,069 --> 00:12:30,707
Because I respected me so much!

199
00:12:34,189 --> 00:12:39,786
Okay! I'm done re-Ca-Foobelling
the energy motron, or whatever!

200
00:12:39,949 --> 00:12:41,860
Fire!

201
00:12:45,109 --> 00:12:51,457
My, what a handsome energy
creature you are! I love you.

202
00:12:53,629 --> 00:12:55,108
Hey, you wrote it!

203
00:13:02,109 --> 00:13:04,703
It's not working! He's drawing
strength from our weapons!

204
00:13:04,869 --> 00:13:07,019
Like a balloon,
and something bad happens!

205
00:13:23,629 --> 00:13:25,062
Yep.

206
00:13:26,949 --> 00:13:28,905
So how's rehearsal going?

207
00:13:29,069 --> 00:13:32,744
Lousy. Here I've been admiring
a bunch of actors while you...

208
00:13:32,909 --> 00:13:36,982
A crew of genuine space heroes,
risked your lives to save them.

209
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:39,105
Hey, we've done heroic things too.

210
00:13:39,269 --> 00:13:41,783
Yeah! In the third season,
I kissed Shatner.

211
00:13:41,949 --> 00:13:47,023
Silence! My whole world has turned
upside down. I have but one option.

212
00:13:47,189 --> 00:13:49,339
Keep them and let us go?
No!

213
00:13:49,549 --> 00:13:52,825
To determine who is more worthy
of my fanatical devotion...

214
00:13:52,989 --> 00:13:56,425
I shall pit you against
each other in armed combat...

215
00:13:56,589 --> 00:13:58,739
To the death!

216
00:13:59,149 --> 00:14:01,265
Where'd you get an
idiotic idea like that?

217
00:14:01,429 --> 00:14:04,978
Episodes 1 9, 46, 56 and 77.

218
00:14:05,149 --> 00:14:08,459
Great list, except you forgot episode 66!

219
00:14:10,509 --> 00:14:12,261
I was getting to that one!

220
00:14:21,989 --> 00:14:26,221
So Melllvar ordered a battle to the death.
I assume no one survived.

221
00:14:27,549 --> 00:14:30,666
Can we get on with this?
My foot's getting tired.

222
00:14:32,789 --> 00:14:35,508
This will be your standard
battle to the death.

223
00:14:35,669 --> 00:14:38,741
The only weapons, whatever you can find.

224
00:14:38,909 --> 00:14:43,505
But I warn you, do nothing until
I have signaled the start of combat.

225
00:14:44,389 --> 00:14:45,947
Okay, start.

226
00:14:53,389 --> 00:14:56,347
I don't have much experience at fighting,
except with you guys.

227
00:14:56,509 --> 00:14:59,945
I have an idea. Wasn't there an episode
where I threw my shoe at the enemy?

228
00:15:00,109 --> 00:15:02,065
You mean Doohan?

229
00:15:03,149 --> 00:15:05,663
Whoever it was, I did it like this.

230
00:15:06,029 --> 00:15:09,101
Ow!
My foot's cold.

231
00:15:10,669 --> 00:15:12,739
There, we can make these into spears.

232
00:15:12,909 --> 00:15:16,379
We can tie caterpillars together to
make bowstrings for bows and arrows.

233
00:15:16,549 --> 00:15:18,824
And we can use this
machine gun to shoot them!

234
00:15:18,989 --> 00:15:20,866
Yee-Haa!

235
00:15:27,789 --> 00:15:29,905
Ha-Ha. That was fun.

236
00:15:31,589 --> 00:15:34,581
What if I distract them
with my famous fan dance?

237
00:15:34,749 --> 00:15:38,105
That's good, good. And then, George,
you give them a karate chop.

238
00:15:38,269 --> 00:15:40,260
I find that offensive.

239
00:15:40,429 --> 00:15:45,059
Just because I'm of Japanese ancestry,
you assume I know karate.

240
00:15:45,229 --> 00:15:48,744
Have I ever led you to
believe I have studied karate?

241
00:15:48,909 --> 00:15:51,377
Well, no. But you never
talk about yourself.

242
00:15:52,269 --> 00:15:54,783
Maybe if you showed a little interest.

243
00:15:54,949 --> 00:15:56,701
Well, here goes nothing.

244
00:16:03,829 --> 00:16:05,740
Hello, boys.

245
00:16:08,069 --> 00:16:09,661
Oh!

246
00:16:09,869 --> 00:16:11,018
Hi-Ya!

247
00:16:15,709 --> 00:16:18,701
There's no right way to hit a woman.
Then do it the wrong way.

248
00:16:18,869 --> 00:16:19,858
Fine.

249
00:16:22,269 --> 00:16:23,622
Is that all you got?

250
00:16:24,229 --> 00:16:26,220
Ow!

251
00:16:35,669 --> 00:16:37,102
Come on, Walter!
Take that!

252
00:16:40,469 --> 00:16:41,743
That hurts!

253
00:16:41,909 --> 00:16:44,946
Let's see if this actually works. Hmm.

254
00:16:46,109 --> 00:16:47,588
Ow! Ow! Ow!

255
00:16:47,749 --> 00:16:49,023
My face!

256
00:16:49,269 --> 00:16:50,941
Ow! My face too!

257
00:16:52,069 --> 00:16:53,582
May l?

258
00:16:57,669 --> 00:17:00,820
Excellent, excellent.

259
00:17:00,989 --> 00:17:04,425
Leela, please.
This is exactly what Melllvar wants.

260
00:17:04,589 --> 00:17:07,501
We're just pawns in his
diabolical game of checkers.

261
00:17:07,669 --> 00:17:10,388
Can't we resolve our
differences some other way?

262
00:17:10,549 --> 00:17:13,746
Melllvar! Dinnertime!

263
00:17:13,909 --> 00:17:16,742
But, Mom, I'm playing
with my collectibles!

264
00:17:16,909 --> 00:17:18,945
Now!
Uh.

265
00:17:20,389 --> 00:17:23,381
All this time we thought he
was a powerful super being...

266
00:17:23,549 --> 00:17:24,982
Yet he was just a child.

267
00:17:25,149 --> 00:17:28,141
He's not a child! He's 34!

268
00:17:29,869 --> 00:17:33,384
All right, Koenig!
I've wanted to do this for years!

269
00:17:33,549 --> 00:17:36,985
Bender, wait! This is our chance
to escape before Melllvar comes back!

270
00:17:37,149 --> 00:17:39,458
But we all need to work together.

271
00:17:42,669 --> 00:17:44,421
I love you so much.

272
00:17:44,589 --> 00:17:45,908
Hello?

273
00:17:46,069 --> 00:17:48,629
We've decided to work together.
So did they.

274
00:17:48,789 --> 00:17:51,064
Now, how do we escape?

275
00:17:51,229 --> 00:17:54,824
We can't use our ship. We have life
support, but the engines are wrecked.

276
00:17:54,989 --> 00:17:59,665
Ironic, because our engines work,
but our life-Support systems don't.

277
00:17:59,829 --> 00:18:01,899
Hey, if your engines work.

278
00:18:02,069 --> 00:18:03,821
And your life-Support systems work.

279
00:18:03,989 --> 00:18:06,059
Stop! You're just
going around in circles!

280
00:18:06,229 --> 00:18:09,187
Think, Fry, think.
Everyone's depending on you.

281
00:18:17,629 --> 00:18:20,985
We're too heavy! You guys
need to lose some weight, fast!

282
00:18:27,469 --> 00:18:30,745
Look, Leonard, we're light enough
to keep the tapes! Isn’t that great?

283
00:18:30,909 --> 00:18:33,264
I'm living in a gefilte-Fish jar.

284
00:18:36,429 --> 00:18:37,418
We did it!

285
00:18:45,349 --> 00:18:47,067
Melllvar's got a spaceship!

286
00:18:47,229 --> 00:18:51,859
Yes! In mint condition, and you
made me take it out of the package!

287
00:18:58,109 --> 00:19:00,179
The Nimbus! We're saved!

288
00:19:00,349 --> 00:19:03,307
You're under arrest!
Prepare to be boarded.

289
00:19:04,109 --> 00:19:06,907
So I boarded you, huh?
What happened next?

290
00:19:07,069 --> 00:19:08,821
You started this stupid court-Martial!

291
00:19:08,989 --> 00:19:11,378
If you don't mind,
we're still fighting Melllvar.

292
00:19:22,869 --> 00:19:24,541
One more hit and we're done for!

293
00:19:24,709 --> 00:19:27,542
Let's take him out with us.
Do you have a self-Destruct code?

294
00:19:27,709 --> 00:19:31,827
Like destruct sequence 1 -A, 2-B, 3--

295
00:19:31,989 --> 00:19:34,981
Thanks a lot, Takei.
Now everybody knows!

296
00:19:35,149 --> 00:19:41,258
If I can 't have the original cast of
Star Trek, no one will. Prepare to die!

297
00:19:41,429 --> 00:19:44,148
Wait! If they mean that much to you,
why would you kill them?

298
00:19:44,309 --> 00:19:46,584
Because l. I.

299
00:19:47,229 --> 00:19:48,947
I don 't know what I'd do without them.

300
00:19:49,109 --> 00:19:52,146
Melllvar, you can't let a
TV show be your whole life.

301
00:19:52,309 --> 00:19:53,662
You can do anything you want.

302
00:19:53,829 --> 00:19:57,026
Look at Walter Koenig.
After Star Trek, he became an actor.

303
00:19:57,189 --> 00:19:59,828
Not just an actor,
but a well-Rounded person...

304
00:19:59,989 --> 00:20:02,787
With my own friends and
credit cards and keys.

305
00:20:02,949 --> 00:20:06,339
Well, I guess I could move
out of my parent's basement...

306
00:20:06,509 --> 00:20:07,942
Maybe get a temp job.

307
00:20:08,109 --> 00:20:09,906
Whoa. Whoa! One step at a time.

308
00:20:10,069 --> 00:20:14,460
I thank you, Fry. You know,
you and I are of a kind.

309
00:20:14,629 --> 00:20:18,304
In a different reality,
I could have called you "friend. "

310
00:20:18,469 --> 00:20:21,142
Episode 10: "Balance of Terror. "

311
00:20:21,309 --> 00:20:23,345
More like episode nine, loser!

312
00:20:23,509 --> 00:20:26,182
In your face! Victory is mine!

313
00:20:29,189 --> 00:20:33,660
I wonder, my friends, was he
really such an evil energy gas?

314
00:20:33,829 --> 00:20:35,740
He did give us eternal youth.

315
00:20:35,909 --> 00:20:37,547
24-Hour Laundromat.

316
00:20:37,709 --> 00:20:41,702
A full assortment of rum,
both spiced and regular.

317
00:20:41,869 --> 00:20:43,985
Truly, it was a paradise.

318
00:20:44,149 --> 00:20:47,983
And all you had to put up with was
one really annoying Star Trek fan.

319
00:20:49,389 --> 00:20:50,868
Let's get the hell out of here.
