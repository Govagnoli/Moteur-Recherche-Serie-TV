00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:09,316
Futurama [4x11] - 30% Iron Chef - CiWaN

2
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:40,194
<i>Welcome back. Our next guest has taught
the world to cook for over 20 years.</i>

3
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:42,920
<i>But apparently my wife
hasn't been listening.</i>

4
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:46,755
<i>Funny.
I will destroy her!</i>

5
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:52,677
<i>And now, extend a formulaic
greeting to master chef Elzar.</i>

6
00:00:55,040 --> 00:01:00,398
<i>So, what will you be cooking for
Morbo to devour with his mighty jaws?</i>

7
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:04,758
<i>I'm gonna whip you up a nice,
unnamable horror from beyond...</i>

8
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:07,115
<i>With mango chutney.</i>

9
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:14,270
<i>Pathetic humans,
prepare to write down the recipe!</i>

10
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:20,151
What's with the pots and pans?
Building a wife?

11
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:26,714
Part of one. Meantime, I'm cooking up
a tasty Sunday brunch for my friends.

12
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:42,072
Brunch. Right. I'd better warn...
Tell... Warn-Tell the others.

13
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:44,350
Okey-Dokey.

14
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,029
Nice.

15
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:57,671
Yes. It's a perfect scale model
of the universe's largest bottle.

16
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:01,509
I put a tiny spaceship inside
to keep it from being boring.

17
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04,831
Oh!
Get! For the last time, Zoidberg

18
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,709
Look with your eyes, not your claws!

19
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:11,593
Brace yourselves.
Bender is making us brunch.

20
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:14,792
Oh, boy!
Oh, God, my tract!

21
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,310
He's proud of his cooking.
If we don't eat, he'll be crushed.

22
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:22,234
Don't panic. If we can get to
the ship, we'll fly north...

23
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:24,715
And hide under the polar icecaps.

24
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:27,559
Good idea!
What's the holdup?

25
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,632
Fleeing somewhere?

26
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:33,753
With you blocking the only
escape route? Don't be silly.

27
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:38,590
In that case, brunch is served.
Let's go, move it out! Stop crying, Leela.

28
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:45,231
Zoidberg, are you coming?
Sure. Me.

29
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:49,635
I don't want you touching that thing!
I know that.

30
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:54,670
Surrender your mysteries to Zoidberg.

31
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:07,709
Oh, no, professor will hit me! But if
Zoidberg fixes it, then perhaps gifts.

32
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:16,873
Oh! Ow. What?

33
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:19,879
I've personalized each of your meals.

34
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:23,516
For example, Amy, you're cute,
so I baked you a pony.

35
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:29,198
Come on, eat!
I slaved all day over a filthy stove.

36
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,474
This is terrible!

37
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:37,553
Good thing I secretly installed
this wormhole in the table.

38
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:46,438
Where does the other end come out?
You know, I'm not quite sure.

39
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:49,910
Dear me.

40
00:03:55,480 --> 00:04:00,076
The pie is ready.
You guys like swarms of things, right?

41
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:05,194
Casual hello. It's me, Zoidberg.
Act naturally.

42
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,230
Ouch! Ouch! Oh! Ah! Oh!

43
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,992
Get off of me! Stop!

44
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:14,318
How interesting, Dr. Zoidberg.
Do go on.

45
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,269
Check out the palm tree.
It gets sick when I cook brunch.

46
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:26,675
How's that for coincidence, professor,
with all your precious science?

47
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:41,676
I don't want to hurt his feelings,
but this tastes better as vomit.

48
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:45,873
It's unbearable. What would it
cost to get my tongue removed?

49
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:19,434
And this time I mean it!

50
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:43,511
Who am I kidding? It was stupid
of me to dream of becoming a chef.

51
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:48,390
I don't have what it takes,
and nothing can change that.

52
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:55,832
Then it's settled.
Elzar will teach me to cook!

53
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,996
Absolutely not.

54
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:03,478
But I watch your show. You owe me.
I owe you nothing!

55
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:07,036
One, your antenna's in my crotch.
Also, I hate you.

56
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,555
And finally, you can't cook for squat.

57
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,794
What was the first one?
I hate you.

58
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,357
I thought that was number two.
I knocked it up a notch. Bam!

59
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:22,837
I'll never recombobulate this ship.

60
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,072
When the professor finds out,
he'll tear me a new cloaca!

61
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:33,199
Wait. What would the robot do?

62
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,429
Frame someone.

63
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:36,749
What up?

64
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:47,475
<i>I'm walking on sunshine...</i>

65
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:57,958
It's over. My dream of being a chef
is deader than the cat I'm sitting on.

66
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:02,113
Gus, let's give a friendly
welcome to this new robo.

67
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:06,319
What did you call me?
A "robo". You know, a robot hobo.

68
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:11,679
Okay. I thought you said "romo."
No offense intended, my filthy friend.

69
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:15,594
In fact, why not join us
and ride the space rails?

70
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:37,479
Get ready. We's gonna jump
off at that switching prism.

71
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:42,589
We're going nearly the speed of light,
so roll when you land.

72
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,395
Ow!

73
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:59,639
Welcome to Bumbase Alpha,
biggest hobo jungle in the quadrant.

74
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:03,793
I've seen bigger.
Wait, I'm thinking of Eugene, Oregon.

75
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,749
Wait, a pie with hobo-Lifting aroma?
Who baked it?

76
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:22,111
Helmut Spargle.
He used to be the greatest chef.

77
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:25,676
His restaurant was so
high-Toned, to get reservations...

78
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:29,719
You had to create a parallel
universe, where you had reservations!

79
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:33,031
I once ate there, back
when I was a senator.

80
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:37,313
Yo, Spargle, if you're such a great
cook, how'd you end up in this dump?

81
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:41,792
Ages ago, I was the host of a TV show:

82
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,276
Down-Home Country Kitchen
with Helmut Spargle.

83
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:49,558
<i>One day, the Extreme Soda
Company that sponsored the show...</i>

84
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:53,998
<i>Decided it was too old-Fashioned.
Spargle, you're fired.</i>

85
00:08:54,160 --> 00:09:00,349
We need a chef who attracts a younger,
more extreme cooking-Show viewer.

86
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:03,193
Elzar!
Get lost, old man.

87
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,319
<i>Bam!
Mein souffl?!</i>

88
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:11,159
Elzar had been seduced by
the dark side of cooking.

89
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:15,950
Cilantro, mango salsa,
raspberry vinaigrette.

90
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,633
That twizzler.

91
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:21,674
As for me, I went temporarily
insane and wound up here...

92
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:24,274
Making pies out of shoes.

93
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:28,473
My story's like yours,
only interesting. It involves robots.

94
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:32,958
That jerk, Elzar, ruined my
dream of being a chef too.

95
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:38,029
Interesting. You wish to cook, but as
a robot, you have no sense of taste.

96
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:41,351
It's so unfair.
I have eight other senses...

97
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:46,469
But I'd trade them all,
even smision, to be able to taste!

98
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:49,712
Without the distraction of taste...

99
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:53,190
Your mind is free to touch
the Zen of pure flavor.

100
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:56,198
You could be the greatest chef!
I could?

101
00:09:56,360 --> 00:10:00,399
Just as Beethoven was a great
composer because he was deaf!

102
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,672
Or how Rembrandt was
blind and had wooden hands!

103
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:06,400
Bender, hear me well.
I shall train you.

104
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:09,950
First, forget everything
you know of cooking.

105
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:11,675
Done.

106
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:40,234
Wow.

107
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:45,756
That's right, Ricardo.
A ship in a bottle.

108
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:48,798
What's that?
Well, hang on, I'll look.

109
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:02,553
I've gathered you in
the accusing parlor...

110
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:05,832
Because one of you is a
miniature-Ship wrecker.

111
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,230
I'm acting astonished.

112
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:14,675
Certain clues suggest the culprit is
none other than our own Philip J. Fry.

113
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,919
What?
It was a brilliant scheme...

114
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:22,358
But you made one fatal mistake:
Leaving this confession note!

115
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:27,238
Scoundrel.
I don't remember any of that...

116
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:29,470
But I can't defend myself.

117
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:35,118
I have no choice but to charge you the
full cost of the materials. $10.00.

118
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:37,629
There you go.

119
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:43,991
What have I done?

120
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:50,111
Your training is complete,
little dessert spoon.

121
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:54,472
Just as he who wishes to be world
chess champion must win at least...

122
00:11:54,640 --> 00:12:00,033
One game of chess, so must you
serve at least one edible meal.

123
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,708
Succeed and I shall reveal to you...

124
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:07,078
The age-Old secret of perfect flavor.

125
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:12,757
Slop's on.
Fine-Looking eats.

126
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:30,789
It is acceptable.
All right!

127
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:36,070
Another thing I'm great at!
Wait, why'd you stop eating, master?

128
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:39,272
Because my stomach is about to explode.

129
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:45,310
What? My dinner killed you? Man!
It hurts.

130
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:51,437
Stay confident. The important thing
is, you defeat Elzar after I am gone.

131
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,433
And using this, you cannot fail.

132
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:57,950
A diamond vial of Mrs. Dash?

133
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:00,594
No, it is the essence of pure flavor.

134
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:05,993
A few drops will cause the inner
perfection of any dish to blossom forth.

135
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:10,348
Oh! There goes my...

136
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:12,033
Life!

137
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:17,317
I'll avenge you, master!

138
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:21,229
I swear, in the presence
of these drunken bums...

139
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:24,676
That I shall defeat Elzar!

140
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:29,397
I'm not drunk. I'm mentally ill.
But I likes what, what you said.

141
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:37,229
Elzar, I'm a walking pile
of your unfinished business!

142
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:41,718
Why, you...
Helmut Spargle has a message for you!

143
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:45,629
He says, "I'm dead."

144
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:48,798
Spargle? What'd he do,
bland himself to death?

145
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:54,393
No, he was eating some food I made and
by coincidence, his stomach exploded.

146
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,994
Now I'm here to avenge him!

147
00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:03,116
Seems you're the one who killed him.
Maybe so, but you're his sworn enemy!

148
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:07,353
I challenge you to a
battle of the chefs!

149
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,149
Scandalous!

150
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:14,593
We'll meet on the ancient televised
battleground of Kitchen Coliseum.

151
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:18,469
Whosever meal is best will
claim the title of Iron Cook.

152
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:22,798
Iron Cook? I can't lose.
I'm 30% iron.

153
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:25,953
You're going down!

154
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:30,398
Also, I had a reservation
for one, under Dr. Bender.

155
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:44,199
<i>Welcome the superintendent of
Kitchen Coliseum, Chairman Koji!</i>

156
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:46,476
<i>No robot chef has competed here.</i>

157
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:51,316
<i>But today, one has barged his way
in to challenge for the title of:</i>

158
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:54,678
Iron Cook!

159
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:01,472
Yeah, you show him!

160
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,591
Meet our celebrity judges.

161
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:08,954
<i>Globetrotter Ethan "Bubblegum" Tate.
Konnichiwa, brother.</i>

162
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:13,199
TV anchor-Monster Morbo.
Greetings, pathetic host.

163
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:16,631
A woman who ended a galactic
war with apple dandies...

164
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:20,349
Martha Stewart's head.
The secret is fresh pork.

165
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:26,711
<i>Koji will present the theme
ingredient to be used in every dish.</i>

166
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:31,909
If it's chicken, chicken? La king.
Fish, fish? La king.

167
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:34,355
Turkey, fish? La king.

168
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:38,873
Soylent Green!

169
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:44,757
<i>A classic ingredient of gourmet
cooking. And the battle is on.</i>

170
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:51,759
<i>What's Elzar making?
Well, Hiroki-San, when I asked him...</i>

171
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:56,516
He asked what it was to me and
conjectured my mother was a prostitute.

172
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:01,475
In the countryside, prostitutes
decorate rooms with festive gourds.

173
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:06,512
<i>Thirty minutes to go.</i>

174
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:09,918
<i>Look at him roll dough!</i>

175
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:13,510
I've never seen such
powerful strokes of the ass.

176
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:16,393
You've never seen mine.
No, I haven't.

177
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:19,273
<i>Fifteen minutes remaining.</i>

178
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:25,158
<i>He's bringing in his
signature creation...</i>

179
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:27,629
<i>A working pastry replica
of downtown Venice.</i>

180
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:38,553
Commemorative turkey basters.
Get your commemorative basters.

181
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:42,639
Yo, hook me up. My turkey is dry,
and I've tried everything.

182
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,358
Right. Never mind.

183
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:50,988
The guilt. The unbearable guilt!

184
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:52,918
<i>Fifteen seconds.</i>

185
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,115
Bam!

186
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:00,988
<i>Ten seconds.</i>

187
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:13,350
Master Spargle, if you can hear me
up in that ditch, where I left you...

188
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:15,152
This is for you.

189
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:22,597
Time up!

190
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,755
<i>He's gone all out for the judges.</i>

191
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:33,829
<i>He's even garnished the salad with
$100 bills. Let's see what they think.</i>

192
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,630
Mmm... Soylent Green
is my kind of people.

193
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:46,991
Scrumptious. Morbo will store this
in his sack for future digestion.

194
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:50,749
I'm swimming in my Soylent waste.
It's a good thing.

195
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:56,075
<i>Next up, Bender, a student
of legendary Helmut Spargle...</i>

196
00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:00,074
<i>Bender is some sort of
wonderful mechanical man.</i>

197
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,672
Ooo... Delicious.

198
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:12,037
This food looks kind of funky,
but it tastes kind of funk-Ay!

199
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:17,315
The challenger's ugly food
shows even hideous things...

200
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:20,040
Can be sweet on the inside.

201
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:29,235
Now judgment.
The winner will be the new Iron Cook.

202
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:33,188
The loser is doomed to scrub.

203
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:38,388
Whose confection achieves perfection?
Whose foodstuff will be the good stuff?

204
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,629
Challenger Bender!

205
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:49,433
That's my robot! I own him!

206
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:54,191
<i>You honor me, Chairman Koji.
Domo arigato, Mr. Roboto.</i>

207
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,994
Chairman-San, I came
here with one goal:

208
00:18:57,160 --> 00:19:01,631
To humiliate Elzar in a large
stadium. I believe I've done that.

209
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,273
No question.

210
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:07,029
But the true Zen of flavor
is not found in a coliseum.

211
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:10,272
It is found in a small
kitchen with friends.

212
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:13,040
So I decline the title of Iron Cook...

213
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:18,399
And accept only the lesser title of
Zinc Saucier, which I just made up.

214
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:21,472
Also, it comes with double prize money.

215
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:28,796
Wait. Everyone must know.
I broke the professor's bottled ship!

216
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:35,319
And what is worse,
I framed my dearest friend, Fry!

217
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:41,314
I can never repay him his $10,
so I must take the only honorable path...

218
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:44,199
What with the killing myself.

219
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:50,554
Here I go already!

220
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:56,877
Huh?
Oh! That sword cost $5000!

221
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:59,119
Fry did it.

222
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:07,114
And that's how I defeated Elzar,
thanks to Spargle's magic liquid.

223
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:10,915
Yes, we were there,
and we just watched it again on TV.

224
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:15,039
Let me see that vial, Bender.

225
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:24,951
Good Lord!
According to the spectrolizer...

226
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:30,319
Spargle's magic ingredient was water!
Ordinary water.

227
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,629
No!

228
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:36,430
So the real gift Spargle gave you
was the confidence to be your best.

229
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:42,948
Yes, ordinary water, laced with nothing
more than a few spoonfuls of LSD.

230
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:47,272
The important thing is, by my
standards, I won fair and square.

231
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:52,600
Now, who wants brunch cooked
with plenty of "confidence"?

232
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:54,478
I'm in!
I do!
