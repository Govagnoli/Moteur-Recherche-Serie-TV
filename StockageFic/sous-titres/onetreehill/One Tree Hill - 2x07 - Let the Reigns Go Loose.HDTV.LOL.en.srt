1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:02,023
Previously on One Tree Hill.

2
00:00:02,138 --> 00:00:03,883
No one else needs... to know.

3
00:00:03,954 --> 00:00:04,840
You mean Karen.

4
00:00:05,142 --> 00:00:07,656
You know, I was thinking about this whole ‘Friends with Benefits’.

5
00:00:08,005 --> 00:00:10,282
Felix with Brooke… FWB.

6
00:00:10,375 --> 00:00:11,835
How many other songs have you written?

7
00:00:12,161 --> 00:00:13,344
I dunno, a few.

8
00:00:13,482 --> 00:00:16,058
- Alright, well you’re gonna open. 
- No, I’m not.

9
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:17,841
I get… major stage fright.

10
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:19,580
You’re gonna have to get out for this one.

11
00:00:20,256 --> 00:00:21,752
You gonna tell me what it was?

12
00:00:22,811 --> 00:00:23,691
Maybe.

13
00:00:23,794 --> 00:00:24,655
You’re great.

14
00:00:24,777 --> 00:00:26,734
Yeah, I know. When do I play?

15
00:00:26,836 --> 00:00:31,289
You’re okay, but… we had a lot of really good people show up today, so…

16
00:00:31,711 --> 00:00:32,815
we’ll call you.

17
00:00:32,929 --> 00:00:34,894
Hey, look, I know it’s kinda short notice so…

18
00:00:35,191 --> 00:00:37,823
bring Lucas along if you can’t find a sitter. Love to meet the little guy.

19
00:00:38,601 --> 00:00:41,028
My brother owns the dealership. I’m just helping out.

20
00:00:41,704 --> 00:00:43,158
I’m actually a mechanic.

21
00:00:43,712 --> 00:00:45,002
I like mechanics.

22
00:00:47,536 --> 00:00:49,267
I got a good sense about people.

23
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:53,854
You’re young, but you… might be worth the risk.

24
00:00:55,155 --> 00:00:56,497
Here’s your shot kid.

25
00:01:40,544 --> 00:01:42,505
Oliver Wendell Holmes once said;

26
00:01:43,621 --> 00:01:46,182
Many people die with their music still in them.

27
00:01:47,031 --> 00:01:51,153
Too often it is because they are always getting ready to live…

28
00:01:52,546 --> 00:01:56,252
Before they know it… time runs out.

29
00:02:02,539 --> 00:02:04,009
You’re still here.

30
00:02:04,397 --> 00:02:08,643
I thought we had an understanding; once the hooking-up is over, you go home.

31
00:02:08,803 --> 00:02:09,733
Damn.

32
00:02:10,419 --> 00:02:12,325
You can make a guy feel used.

33
00:02:12,477 --> 00:02:13,952
Oh I’m sorry.

34
00:02:14,131 --> 00:02:17,280
Well you could just cancel our little arrangement and save your pride.

35
00:02:18,085 --> 00:02:20,481
Nah. Being used is fine.

36
00:02:20,942 --> 00:02:25,458
Yeah, that’s what I thought. So why don’t you get your used butt up outta my bed, ‘Pool Boy’.

37
00:02:26,317 --> 00:02:28,964
I have a big day ahead of me and you’re in my way.

38
00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:41,212
Hi.

39
00:02:42,036 --> 00:02:44,166
I think you got the wrong store.

40
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:46,879
‘Forever 21’s just down the street there.

41
00:02:48,523 --> 00:02:50,131
That’s Jeff Buckley. You heard of him?

42
00:02:50,576 --> 00:02:52,466
Who hasn’t heard of Jeff Buckley?

43
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:55,189
That man’s the reason I became a musician. You know why?

44
00:02:55,528 --> 00:02:57,288
Because he never sold out.

45
00:02:57,498 --> 00:03:00,755
Why stop there? Didn’t he also drown in a river?

46
00:03:00,838 --> 00:03:05,040
Listen, if you want me to play your show, you’re gonna have to ask nicely.

47
00:03:06,622 --> 00:03:08,507
- I don’t need this. 
- Sure you do.

48
00:03:08,603 --> 00:03:10,934
Why else would you be here at eight a.m. on a school day?

49
00:03:13,904 --> 00:03:18,804
Okay, here’s the deal; the turn-out for auditions was kind low so… if you want...

50
00:03:18,853 --> 00:03:19,796
Read my Writer.

51
00:03:20,554 --> 00:03:23,728
- What is this? 
- It’s like… a list of artist’s demands.

52
00:03:23,892 --> 00:03:25,424
I know what a Writer is.

53
00:03:27,134 --> 00:03:30,682
Camomile tea… one small vegetarian pizza…

54
00:03:30,753 --> 00:03:34,357
Oh! One box Magnum, extra large sized condoms. Are you kidding!

55
00:03:34,456 --> 00:03:37,684
The regular ones cut off the circulation. We got a deal here or what?

56
00:03:41,045 --> 00:03:42,433
You go on at nine.

57
00:03:44,076 --> 00:03:45,433
Have fun at school.

58
00:03:53,438 --> 00:03:57,490
Come on, pony up people! There’s kids in this world a lot more miserable than you!

59
00:03:58,509 --> 00:03:59,881
Thank you. God bless.

60
00:03:59,947 --> 00:04:02,370
Look at this; one over-ripe cantaloupe,

61
00:04:02,416 --> 00:04:05,011
two number three pencils, what kinda Writer is this?

62
00:04:05,702 --> 00:04:06,753
God bless you.

63
00:04:08,027 --> 00:04:09,169
Change for the needy?

64
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:12,681
Brooke, I had no idea you were so… charitable. What’s the cause?

65
00:04:12,809 --> 00:04:16,183
Just… needy people. God bless you.

66
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:18,677
Brooke. I recognise the photo.

67
00:04:19,162 --> 00:04:21,144
It’s from an add for cramp medicine.

68
00:04:22,287 --> 00:04:26,419
Wow. Homeless and PMSing… poor girl.

69
00:04:26,501 --> 00:04:27,345
Brooke!

70
00:04:27,754 --> 00:04:29,669
Alright. The money’s for me.

71
00:04:29,843 --> 00:04:33,054
I’m the needy one as in I need some things for your club opening.

72
00:04:34,652 --> 00:04:36,588
Do you realise how wrong that is?

73
00:04:36,683 --> 00:04:40,091
Sort of, but… you know, what am I supposed to do for money?

74
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:43,043
- Try getting a job. 
- Right, doing what?

75
00:04:43,119 --> 00:04:45,664
Anything, a number of things. What are your skills?

76
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:49,755
I dunno. I’m good with guys. Dates, dating.

77
00:04:49,899 --> 00:04:50,883
Yeah, and?

78
00:04:51,148 --> 00:04:52,289
Sex but…

79
00:04:52,464 --> 00:04:53,791
That would make you a hooker.

80
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:56,264
Thank you.

81
00:04:58,408 --> 00:04:59,985
I’ll take you shopping on a budget.

82
00:05:04,921 --> 00:05:06,964
- Hey Felix. 
- Mighty Mouth.

83
00:05:07,302 --> 00:05:09,089
You going to the club opening tomorrow?

84
00:05:09,314 --> 00:05:11,398
- That’s the plan. 
- You taking Brooke?

85
00:05:11,787 --> 00:05:14,849
Nah, I like to alternate my cheerleaders. This week - Theresa.

86
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:16,431
But I thought you and Brooke were together.

87
00:05:17,115 --> 00:05:18,647
It doesn’t really work like that.

88
00:05:19,052 --> 00:05:21,357
So… she’s not gonna be there with anybody?

89
00:05:22,083 --> 00:05:23,153
Not that I know of.

90
00:05:32,454 --> 00:05:33,275
Hey you.

91
00:05:33,606 --> 00:05:34,500
Hey you.

92
00:05:35,365 --> 00:05:36,859
You know, I had a great time the other night.

93
00:05:37,428 --> 00:05:40,516
Me too. Listen, can we talk?

94
00:05:41,504 --> 00:05:42,732
That doesn’t sound good.

95
00:05:43,029 --> 00:05:44,616
It’s not like that. It’s just…

96
00:05:44,898 --> 00:05:48,436
I love spending time with you. You know that… but…

97
00:05:48,513 --> 00:05:53,080
being dropped in a new place is hard enough without jumping into a new relationship too.

98
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:56,157
You must really hate me.

99
00:05:56,515 --> 00:06:01,323
Stop it! I’m just saying, let’s not rush things. Let’s hang out, see where it goes.

100
00:06:02,198 --> 00:06:03,382
Did Felix say something?

101
00:06:03,868 --> 00:06:05,932
No, it’s not that. Promise.

102
00:06:07,068 --> 00:06:08,183
Okay, friends.

103
00:06:09,336 --> 00:06:10,615
With potential.

104
00:06:13,016 --> 00:06:15,727
- Hi.
- Ready for your big debut rock star?

105
00:06:15,828 --> 00:06:17,953
- Please don’t remind me. 
- She’s ready.

106
00:06:18,035 --> 00:06:21,143
You know, didn’t you once tell me that there was such a thing as over preparation?

107
00:06:21,224 --> 00:06:25,233
Yeah, for a math midterm. This is like… avoiding public humiliation.

108
00:06:25,326 --> 00:06:27,174
Hales, you’re gonna do great.

109
00:06:42,606 --> 00:06:43,456
Hey.

110
00:06:48,264 --> 00:06:48,965
Hey.

111
00:06:50,142 --> 00:06:52,395
Saturday night, three bands. Bring your friends.

112
00:06:53,916 --> 00:06:55,564
Adrian Tomine fan?

113
00:06:56,933 --> 00:06:58,002
You know his stuff?

114
00:06:58,125 --> 00:07:00,899
Yeah. Oh, I love Optic Nerve.

115
00:07:00,986 --> 00:07:04,008
Really?! Wow, a fellow comic book geek.

116
00:07:04,535 --> 00:07:05,683
Well, closeted.

117
00:07:07,305 --> 00:07:09,062
- I’m Anna. 
- I’m Peyton.

118
00:07:09,338 --> 00:07:10,966
You’re Felix’s sister right?

119
00:07:12,192 --> 00:07:14,703
On the days that I claim him, yeah.

120
00:07:14,770 --> 00:07:18,272
Oh. So how’s… Tree Hill treating you?

121
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:19,563
Okay.

122
00:07:21,026 --> 00:07:24,253
But I think someone for not giving me the secret password.

123
00:07:24,349 --> 00:07:27,504
Yeah, people in this town tend to stick to their own crowd.

124
00:07:31,590 --> 00:07:33,105
At least the guys are cute.

125
00:07:36,408 --> 00:07:37,319
Okay.

126
00:07:37,970 --> 00:07:40,438
Tree Hill rule number one;

127
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:44,563
people in this town tend to have really complicated histories.

128
00:07:50,691 --> 00:07:53,073
Dan! How’re you feeling?

129
00:07:53,355 --> 00:07:54,062
Good.

130
00:07:54,859 --> 00:07:57,118
Good, Deb’s not in till four.

131
00:07:57,451 --> 00:07:58,598
I came to see you.

132
00:08:00,764 --> 00:08:01,716
Okay.

133
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:03,297
To apologise.

134
00:08:04,553 --> 00:08:07,102
I was hoping you’d forgive me for the things I’ve done to hurt you.

135
00:08:09,665 --> 00:08:11,532
Can I be honest with you Dan?

136
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:16,252
You’re creeping everybody out.

137
00:08:16,441 --> 00:08:20,594
This Phoenix bird thing, this sensitive thing that you’re pulling; no one’s buying it.

138
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:23,077
I’m sorry you feel that way.

139
00:08:23,675 --> 00:08:24,797
But I understand.

140
00:08:26,326 --> 00:08:29,221
Oh, by the way, Deb says Keith hasn’t been hanging around here lately.

141
00:08:29,611 --> 00:08:31,515
I hope it’s not because of what happened.

142
00:08:32,117 --> 00:08:34,198
You should know that I’ve chosen to forgive him.

143
00:08:34,357 --> 00:08:35,545
For what?

144
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:38,213
For sleeping with Deb.

145
00:08:41,833 --> 00:08:43,415
Oh, I’m sorry Karen…

146
00:08:43,993 --> 00:08:45,698
I really thought that you knew.

147
00:09:06,111 --> 00:09:06,931
Speak!

148
00:09:07,054 --> 00:09:09,265
Hey. It’s uh… it’s Keith.

149
00:09:09,373 --> 00:09:12,496
Sorry, I know a lotta Keith’s. Could you be more specific?

150
00:09:12,805 --> 00:09:14,529
The Keith you kissed the other night?

151
00:09:15,051 --> 00:09:17,038
Nah, you gotta give me more than that.

152
00:09:17,638 --> 00:09:20,166
Uh… in a convertible.

153
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:22,716
On a car ramp at Scott motors.

154
00:09:22,927 --> 00:09:27,110
Okay, that… that narrows it down to about a half-a-dozen or so.

155
00:09:28,358 --> 00:09:29,485
You’re funny.

156
00:09:29,874 --> 00:09:32,869
Uh… hey look, I know its last minute but...

157
00:09:33,504 --> 00:09:36,325
there’s a club opening tonight. You wanna go?

158
00:09:36,653 --> 00:09:40,037
Wow, I dunno. I think I already have a date.

159
00:09:40,687 --> 00:09:43,386
Besides, don’t you know about the Wednesday rule?

160
00:09:43,821 --> 00:09:44,921
The Wednesday rule?

161
00:09:45,034 --> 00:09:48,573
A girl can’t accept a weekend date if the offer comes after Wednesday.

162
00:09:48,773 --> 00:09:49,789
It’s a rule.

163
00:09:50,001 --> 00:09:51,854
Yeah, well you know who follows those rules?

164
00:09:51,947 --> 00:09:53,933
Girls who sit at home on the weekends.

165
00:09:57,097 --> 00:09:59,168
Well you may be in luck.

166
00:09:59,335 --> 00:10:02,033
I’ve never been a big fan of rules. Eight o’clock?

167
00:10:04,152 --> 00:10:06,181
Does this look overly ripe to you?

168
00:10:06,559 --> 00:10:08,961
Sorry, that’s not my area of expertise.

169
00:10:09,227 --> 00:10:11,638
So what’s going on with you and Felix now?

170
00:10:11,738 --> 00:10:12,903
I don’t know.

171
00:10:13,032 --> 00:10:16,277
I mean the whole point of ‘Friends with Benefits’ is that there’s no strings attached, right?

172
00:10:16,334 --> 00:10:16,912
Right.

173
00:10:17,071 --> 00:10:19,858
Well lately he’s been getting really stringy on me.

174
00:10:20,834 --> 00:10:23,666
And why are we looking for… overly ripe fruit again?

175
00:10:23,855 --> 00:10:25,007
Chris’ Writer.

176
00:10:25,462 --> 00:10:28,637
Basically, I have to give him everything on this list or he won’t perform.

177
00:10:28,913 --> 00:10:33,223
So wait a second, he makes a list and you have to do everything on it to get what you want?

178
00:10:33,512 --> 00:10:34,372
Exactly.

179
00:10:36,742 --> 00:10:37,879
Interesting.

180
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:45,758
Just in time.

181
00:10:46,193 --> 00:10:48,149
Just let me finish here and then we can go upstairs.

182
00:10:48,298 --> 00:10:51,995
You can go upstairs and… finish yourself. I just came by to give you this.

183
00:10:52,302 --> 00:10:55,988
It’s a Writer. List of artist’s demands. Peyton told me about it.

184
00:10:56,491 --> 00:10:57,366
What’s it for?

185
00:10:57,903 --> 00:11:00,950
Well, yesterday you seemed a little sketchy on the terms of our agreement

186
00:11:01,021 --> 00:11:02,875
so I figured I’d clear it up for you.

187
00:11:04,252 --> 00:11:05,557
With a bunch of rules?

188
00:11:06,489 --> 00:11:11,835
And you better follow them if you ever want me to… perform at your venue again.

189
00:11:14,646 --> 00:11:17,677
No sleeping over. No sleeping late.

190
00:11:18,405 --> 00:11:21,078
No non-sexual bathing, is this necessary?

191
00:11:21,415 --> 00:11:23,063
You’ve been getting a little needy.

192
00:11:23,452 --> 00:11:24,399
Needy?

193
00:11:25,695 --> 00:11:27,216
Please, I have a date tonight.

194
00:11:28,024 --> 00:11:29,438
You are okay with that?

195
00:11:30,211 --> 00:11:31,528
Item 12.

196
00:11:33,805 --> 00:11:36,499
No asking if it’s okay to date other people.

197
00:11:37,691 --> 00:11:38,747
So we’re clear?

198
00:11:40,077 --> 00:11:40,850
Crystal.

199
00:11:56,344 --> 00:11:57,573
That’s an odd sight.

200
00:11:58,745 --> 00:12:00,516
What, you thought I’d be blind?

201
00:12:00,808 --> 00:12:02,631
No, I just didn’t think you could read.

202
00:12:03,374 --> 00:12:07,305
Five hundred things a person should see before they die.

203
00:12:09,097 --> 00:12:11,140
I’ve seen twelve of them.

204
00:12:11,810 --> 00:12:13,306
You gonna do something about that?

205
00:12:13,706 --> 00:12:14,991
Well that’s the plan.

206
00:12:15,836 --> 00:12:18,027
At least until practice starts.

207
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:23,019
I always wanted to die with the matarays in Tobago.

208
00:12:26,445 --> 00:12:28,236
So... Coach…

209
00:12:29,270 --> 00:12:30,956
I turned down ‘High Flyers’.

210
00:12:31,954 --> 00:12:35,595
Is there a reason you turned them down or… should I even ask?

211
00:12:35,799 --> 00:12:39,229
Well it’s just… Haley’s pursuing this whole music thing.

212
00:12:40,238 --> 00:12:44,047
She’s done a lot for me, Coach. It’s her turn now.

213
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:47,170
And me going to camp is just standing in the way of that.

214
00:12:48,726 --> 00:12:53,366
Sometimes… marriage is about sacrifice.

215
00:12:56,069 --> 00:13:00,426
Maybe you’re not taking a step forward as a basketball player…

216
00:13:01,875 --> 00:13:04,937
but you’re taking two steps forward as a man.

217
00:13:10,851 --> 00:13:11,710
Thanks Coach.

218
00:13:17,409 --> 00:13:18,136
Hey.

219
00:13:19,626 --> 00:13:20,492
Oh hi.

220
00:13:21,398 --> 00:13:26,528
Hi. I just dropped by to… wish you good luck tonight.

221
00:13:26,804 --> 00:13:29,067
Thanks. You’re still coming right?

222
00:13:29,175 --> 00:13:30,174
Of course, yeah.

223
00:13:30,557 --> 00:13:31,458
Oh, good.

224
00:13:31,909 --> 00:13:35,032
Um… I also wanted to talk to you about something else.

225
00:13:36,169 --> 00:13:37,026
Okay.

226
00:13:38,381 --> 00:13:43,106
Um… I know that you and I were never… an item

227
00:13:44,356 --> 00:13:46,046
but I thought you should know…

228
00:13:47,233 --> 00:13:48,411
I’d like to…

229
00:13:49,759 --> 00:13:51,396
bring a date to the club tonight.

230
00:13:53,147 --> 00:13:54,262
Anyone I know?

231
00:13:54,647 --> 00:13:58,903
Uh… her name’s Jules. I… I met her at the dealership.

232
00:14:00,884 --> 00:14:02,082
Is… that it?

233
00:14:03,571 --> 00:14:04,380
Yeah.

234
00:14:05,408 --> 00:14:07,994
Good! I look forward to meeting her.

235
00:14:08,158 --> 00:14:08,881
Okay.

236
00:14:09,512 --> 00:14:11,056
Beware of strangers bearing gifts.

237
00:14:12,414 --> 00:14:16,018
- What is that Andy? 
- Well look, every… cool club needs its own t-shirt right?

238
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:18,773
- So… here you go. 
- There are sweet.

239
00:14:18,859 --> 00:14:21,170
Oh, Lucas. That reminds me. Uh, I got him one too.

240
00:14:25,603 --> 00:14:28,354
Oh, um… Keith, this is Andy.

241
00:14:29,367 --> 00:14:30,774
My professor.

242
00:14:33,816 --> 00:14:36,600
- Nice to meet you, Keith. 
- Yeah. Yeah you too.

243
00:14:43,309 --> 00:14:46,534
- But I want it so bad!
- No. It’s not in the budget.

244
00:14:46,599 --> 00:14:49,432
Besides, if you get the purse, then you can’t afford the outfit for the opening.

245
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:52,340
Screw the opening. I’ll stay at home with the purse.

246
00:14:53,969 --> 00:14:55,636
What’s going on, you alright?

247
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:58,479
- Yeah, I just feel a little light headed. 
- Why?

248
00:14:59,165 --> 00:15:02,104
- I… sold some stuff. 
- What stuff?

249
00:15:02,924 --> 00:15:05,262
Some… blood.

250
00:15:05,407 --> 00:15:09,313
Blood!? You sold blood? Brooke, you really think that’s a good idea?

251
00:15:09,394 --> 00:15:11,775
You actually don’t look very well. Kinda… pasty.

252
00:15:11,859 --> 00:15:15,238
I’m discount shopping. I’m gonna have to get used to looking like crap.

253
00:15:15,325 --> 00:15:17,833
And besides, I needed some extra money for the dress.

254
00:15:17,929 --> 00:15:19,348
Which is only thirty-six bucks.

255
00:15:19,607 --> 00:15:20,269
Shoes.

256
00:15:20,347 --> 00:15:22,237
- Eighteen dollars. 
- Eyeliner to go with the shoes.

257
00:15:22,329 --> 00:15:27,432
Seven fifty, which is what? Sixty-one fifty with tax. I mean please, you have plenty left over for...

258
00:15:27,526 --> 00:15:30,282
Alcohol! We’ll stop by the liquor store on the way home.

259
00:15:30,356 --> 00:15:33,409
I really don’t think you should be drinking after you just gave blood.

260
00:15:33,505 --> 00:15:36,357
No! The woman told me to re-hydrate myself and besides,

261
00:15:36,439 --> 00:15:40,086
if I’m gonna be seen in these shoes, I’m gonna need a drink or two.

262
00:15:43,838 --> 00:15:46,665
Okay, we’ll have a DJ downstairs.

263
00:15:46,725 --> 00:15:49,025
The bar is stocked. Wristbands?

264
00:15:49,141 --> 00:15:51,142
Uh… they are down front with Junk right now.

265
00:15:53,391 --> 00:15:54,139
That’s it !

266
00:15:55,322 --> 00:15:56,514
It’s out of our hands.

267
00:15:56,761 --> 00:15:58,622
Oh no, you forgot something.

268
00:15:58,829 --> 00:15:59,475
What!?

269
00:16:00,032 --> 00:16:01,328
To take a deep breath.

270
00:16:02,424 --> 00:16:04,020
Just for a second. Look around, I…

271
00:16:04,713 --> 00:16:07,779
you guys did this. And it’s great.

272
00:16:08,189 --> 00:16:08,957
Yeah.

273
00:16:10,991 --> 00:16:14,640
Oh god, but what if I didn’t make better flyers, what if I didn’t put up enough

274
00:16:14,702 --> 00:16:17,056
- and then what if nobody shows up outside and...
- Come here.

275
00:16:19,105 --> 00:16:21,264
I don’t think that that’s gonna be a problem.

276
00:16:47,213 --> 00:16:49,604
Okay, my thighs are itching…

277
00:16:49,728 --> 00:16:52,421
and not so much in a good way, I think I’m allergic to polyester.

278
00:16:53,353 --> 00:16:55,343
But it’s fine; I’ve had a few drinks.

279
00:16:55,431 --> 00:16:57,976
I should have a few drinks because… do you see all these people?

280
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:59,348
You’re gonna be fine.

281
00:17:00,648 --> 00:17:03,173
Hey, Miss Roe. Club looks great.

282
00:17:03,506 --> 00:17:06,306
Uh… let’s see the wrist, Brooke.

283
00:17:09,434 --> 00:17:12,055
No alcohol! Are we clear?

284
00:17:12,496 --> 00:17:13,352
Yes.

285
00:17:13,483 --> 00:17:15,820
Good. Now go have some fun.

286
00:17:19,621 --> 00:17:22,803
This is definitely the first time I’ve felt like the oldest person in the bar.

287
00:17:23,033 --> 00:17:24,309
Second oldest.

288
00:17:26,679 --> 00:17:30,591
Oh, Andy, this is Peyton. Peyton, this is… my friend, Andy.

289
00:17:30,728 --> 00:17:31,462
Hi.

290
00:17:31,753 --> 00:17:34,390
Hi. Um… well I’ll try to keep out of your hair.

291
00:17:34,457 --> 00:17:36,505
You didn’t happen to bring little Lucas tonight did you?

292
00:17:36,596 --> 00:17:40,093
Oh, well. Yeah… he’s wondering around here somewhere.

293
00:17:40,171 --> 00:17:42,685
Great, great. I can’t wait to meet him.

294
00:17:45,306 --> 00:17:48,593
- Little Lucas? 
- His words, not mine.

295
00:17:49,237 --> 00:17:53,185
So, what’s the story with you and your… friend.

296
00:17:55,219 --> 00:17:57,317
You know, I’m not sure how to describe it.

297
00:17:57,430 --> 00:17:59,207
Put it this way; are you two getting…?

298
00:17:59,513 --> 00:18:00,298
Peyton!

299
00:18:01,479 --> 00:18:05,898
Cos if you were, I’d… I’d describe it as pretty lucky.

300
00:18:06,503 --> 00:18:07,735
He’s a fox.

301
00:18:13,379 --> 00:18:16,322
So, how was your other date before the cancellation?

302
00:18:16,723 --> 00:18:18,177
Why? You wanna ask him out?

303
00:18:18,329 --> 00:18:20,644
No, just didn’t know you were seeing other people.

304
00:18:20,761 --> 00:18:22,406
If you’re one of them, I’d shut up.

305
00:18:22,523 --> 00:18:24,858
Okay, you know, that’s a good point.

306
00:18:25,862 --> 00:18:26,860
So how’s it going Junk?

307
00:18:27,022 --> 00:18:31,228
All good. Here you are, Mr Scott plus one.

308
00:18:31,421 --> 00:18:34,432
VIP - over twenty-one wristbands.

309
00:18:34,581 --> 00:18:37,977
- I didn’t know you were so hip, Keith. 
- Yeah, well neither did I.

310
00:18:41,308 --> 00:18:45,538
Karen never said anything about drinking outside of her club.

311
00:18:50,117 --> 00:18:52,511
Hey Brooke. I like your dress.

312
00:18:54,412 --> 00:18:58,154
So… I was wondering if maybe you wanted to do something some time.

313
00:19:01,021 --> 00:19:03,131
Hey, you wanna catch a movie some time?

314
00:19:04,490 --> 00:19:05,383
Sup Mouth?

315
00:19:08,514 --> 00:19:12,961
- Hmm… hey Theresa! Nice dress. 
- Um… thanks.

316
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:18,041
Why does it look so familiar? Oh I remember, cos it used to be mine.

317
00:19:18,210 --> 00:19:21,010
Brooke, I asked you before I bought it. You said it was okay.

318
00:19:21,117 --> 00:19:23,641
Yeah, well that’s before I knew how your ass would look in it.

319
00:19:24,378 --> 00:19:27,036
Theresa, why don’t you go up, I’ll be right there.

320
00:19:31,201 --> 00:19:35,345
I’d have to check the list but I’m pretty sure acting like a jealous girlfriend is against the rules.

321
00:19:35,438 --> 00:19:36,871
I’m not jealous!

322
00:19:37,501 --> 00:19:41,087
I just figured you’d have gone for someone with a little more class.

323
00:19:41,793 --> 00:19:45,715
Why? I went for you, didn’t I?

324
00:20:00,476 --> 00:20:02,149
- Hey. 
- Hey!

325
00:20:04,566 --> 00:20:05,759
I can’t do it.

326
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,997
- What? 
- I can’t do it.

327
00:20:08,176 --> 00:20:08,934
Do what?

328
00:20:09,441 --> 00:20:13,081
Play. At all. I have to back out.

329
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:14,781
And you’re telling me this now?!

330
00:20:14,889 --> 00:20:19,661
I’m sorry! It’s just all these people and... I told you this might happen, okay?

331
00:20:19,748 --> 00:20:22,507
So please just… don’t hate me. I’m sorry.

332
00:20:22,578 --> 00:20:25,185
Haley, you can’t do this okay? You’re name’s already on the poster,

333
00:20:25,257 --> 00:20:26,931
there are people here expecting you to play.

334
00:20:27,003 --> 00:20:28,933
Well so what? I mean, who’s gonna know the difference, right?

335
00:20:28,984 --> 00:20:31,580
You’ve already got two acts and a DJ, right?

336
00:20:34,190 --> 00:20:35,445
I’ll figure it out.

337
00:20:37,165 --> 00:20:37,857
Okay.

338
00:20:37,934 --> 00:20:39,884
But you’re gonna have to get on that floor sometime.

339
00:20:51,743 --> 00:20:55,348
Hey Karen! This crowd; you must be thrilled.

340
00:20:55,433 --> 00:20:58,874
Oh, try crazy. Seems like every teenager in the town showed up.

341
00:20:58,947 --> 00:21:00,247
So Andy made it.

342
00:21:00,343 --> 00:21:03,248
Yeah, I’m still trying to figure out how to introduce him to Lucas.

343
00:21:03,447 --> 00:21:05,766
Uh-uh well… think fast.

344
00:21:06,734 --> 00:21:10,252
So ‘Kings of Convenience’? I just got their album last week. It’s great.

345
00:21:10,374 --> 00:21:11,545
Oh, you should see them live.

346
00:21:11,633 --> 00:21:12,812
Oh god, I bet.

347
00:21:13,218 --> 00:21:14,957
So how’d you find out about the club?

348
00:21:15,710 --> 00:21:18,823
I’m actually kind of... dating the woman who’s responsible for all this.

349
00:21:18,971 --> 00:21:21,085
Really? You dating Peyton?

350
00:21:21,199 --> 00:21:22,796
- She’s got the curly hair right? 
- Yeah.

351
00:21:23,093 --> 00:21:26,860
Yeah, the cops’ll love that. No, no, no, no, her name’s… Karen.

352
00:21:26,938 --> 00:21:27,664
Andy.

353
00:21:29,212 --> 00:21:30,046
Mom?

354
00:21:31,653 --> 00:21:32,385
Mom?

355
00:21:33,482 --> 00:21:34,496
Oh boy.

356
00:21:36,077 --> 00:21:40,434
Lucas, this is Andy. Andy… this is my son, Lucas.

357
00:21:40,987 --> 00:21:43,163
Um… little Lucas?

358
00:21:44,468 --> 00:21:49,487
I… I thought you were six. Not… six one.

359
00:22:00,259 --> 00:22:03,716
Oh hey, there’s... someone I want you to meet. Deb!

360
00:22:04,207 --> 00:22:06,506
Oh Keith, I was hoping you’d make it.

361
00:22:06,671 --> 00:22:12,031
Uh… Jules, this is… my sister-in-law, Deb. Deb, this is Jules, my…

362
00:22:12,195 --> 00:22:14,140
Girlfriend. Nice to meet you.

363
00:22:14,426 --> 00:22:15,753
This is my girlfriend, Jules.

364
00:22:15,850 --> 00:22:17,109
Nice to meet you too.

365
00:22:17,221 --> 00:22:19,367
Thank you. I’ll uh, get us some drinks?

366
00:22:19,474 --> 00:22:21,446
Okay. I’ll just take a water.

367
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:23,258
Two tequilas it is.

368
00:22:26,715 --> 00:22:29,217
- She seems fun. 
- Yeah, she’s really great.

369
00:22:31,262 --> 00:22:33,467
It’s nice to see good things happen to you Keith.

370
00:22:34,164 --> 00:22:35,173
You deserve it.

371
00:22:48,542 --> 00:22:50,738
Previously on ‘Saved By the Bell’.

372
00:22:50,829 --> 00:22:53,170
Hey, Chris, this is my husband Nathan.

373
00:22:53,446 --> 00:22:56,134
Married in high school. Yeah, that’ll work.

374
00:22:56,553 --> 00:22:58,438
Peyton told me you bailed on the gig.

375
00:22:59,616 --> 00:23:01,341
Guess I was wrong about you.

376
00:23:11,088 --> 00:23:15,212
Appropriate response. So, ready for our first dance?

377
00:23:15,595 --> 00:23:18,564
I don’t know. Are friends supposed to have a first dance?

378
00:23:18,786 --> 00:23:20,813
They are when the have potential.

379
00:23:29,538 --> 00:23:33,567
Yo! You wanna explain this? My sister’s topless.

380
00:23:33,618 --> 00:23:34,938
You wanna get that outta my face?

381
00:23:36,327 --> 00:23:38,529
Lucas, just walk away. Please.

382
00:23:41,421 --> 00:23:43,572
Outside! Now!

383
00:23:54,302 --> 00:23:56,560
- Are you out of your mind?!
- Are you out of yours?

384
00:23:56,971 --> 00:23:59,003
It’s because of crap like this, we had to move again…

385
00:23:59,384 --> 00:24:01,440
and you know what? I liked my last life.

386
00:24:01,528 --> 00:24:03,529
- Oh, great! This again. You...
- You want people to talk?

387
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:06,673
Keep it up, oh cos they will. Just like the last time.

388
00:24:07,048 --> 00:24:11,071
Just because people say something, doesn’t make true Felix. Those were rumours!

389
00:24:11,132 --> 00:24:13,827
Yeah? Well how do you think rumours get started?

390
00:24:21,864 --> 00:24:24,080
Hey, what’s going on Tree Hill?!

391
00:24:25,464 --> 00:24:28,838
Uh… I’d like to welcome you guys to the opening night of TRIC.

392
00:24:28,899 --> 00:24:32,647
It’s a night we like to call… House of Freaks. You guys ready?!

393
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:34,420
Yeah? Okay, great!

394
00:24:34,766 --> 00:24:38,786
Well then please help me in welcoming, to the stage, Chris Keller.

395
00:24:55,152 --> 00:24:57,228
- Hey P. Sawyer. 
- Hey!

396
00:24:57,313 --> 00:24:59,764
It’s your big night. I’m sorry I didn’t get you anything un...

397
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:03,281
- Okay, sush, sush. It’s okay. 
- Boy’s a fox.

398
00:25:04,201 --> 00:25:06,541
- Hey, show us your te...!!
- Hey!

399
00:25:11,524 --> 00:25:12,916
Alright, here we go now.

400
00:25:29,474 --> 00:25:30,381
Hey!

401
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:35,562
You guys aren’t ready for this!

402
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:40,534
What!

403
00:25:44,490 --> 00:25:45,987
Ah, what’re you gonna do, right?

404
00:25:46,064 --> 00:25:47,568
Hey, wait a second. What about Peyton?

405
00:25:48,071 --> 00:25:51,551
Tough break. Least it beat being screwed over by a friend, right?

406
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:00,609
Sorry, sorry everybody. Uh… we just had a little…

407
00:26:01,239 --> 00:26:03,461
I’m not… whatever that was.

408
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:08,531
Uh, but while we’re sorting it out, the DJ’s gonna play and…

409
00:26:09,945 --> 00:26:12,114
how bout a… a free round on the house?

410
00:26:15,423 --> 00:26:17,004
No! All-ages!

411
00:26:17,444 --> 00:26:20,347
Oh juice! Of juice! Of juice. A free round of juice.

412
00:26:24,028 --> 00:26:25,585
Hey! What are you doing?!

413
00:26:25,728 --> 00:26:26,984
- Not playing. 
- Why?!

414
00:26:27,131 --> 00:26:30,081
Because playing to a bunch of mallrats who hate anything they can’t PoGo

415
00:26:30,188 --> 00:26:31,484
to aint what Chris Keller’s about.

416
00:26:31,564 --> 00:26:34,771
Really? That would have been really nice for you to tell me before I put you up on stage!

417
00:26:34,858 --> 00:26:38,175
Also it would have been nice to know you talk about yourself in third person!

418
00:26:38,303 --> 00:26:40,771
Okay, I get it; Curly’s pissed but look at it this way,

419
00:26:40,839 --> 00:26:43,921
if I hadn’t done what I did, would she be up there right now?

420
00:26:50,833 --> 00:26:53,433
Don’t think. Just play.

421
00:27:13,731 --> 00:27:16,094
So… you’re saying you went through all this

422
00:27:16,141 --> 00:27:17,769
just to get Haley up there to play?

423
00:27:18,061 --> 00:27:20,969
Who knows? Chris Keller aint telling.

424
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:46,544
You did a really good thing for her Nate.

425
00:27:47,005 --> 00:27:50,630
No, she did it all by herself.

426
00:28:23,455 --> 00:28:26,927
Hi Brooke, I like your dress. Is it new?

427
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:29,876
Unfortunately, it’s discount.

428
00:28:31,469 --> 00:28:33,711
Well it’s hard to believe. Cos you look…

429
00:28:35,068 --> 00:28:35,994
beautiful.

430
00:28:44,617 --> 00:28:47,304
Why can’t guys be more like you, Mouth?

431
00:28:47,786 --> 00:28:50,791
I mean, you’re loyal… sweet…

432
00:28:51,026 --> 00:28:53,141
and you bought my dollhouse back for me.

433
00:28:54,376 --> 00:28:57,458
- It wasn’t that big a deal. 
- Yes it was.

434
00:28:59,136 --> 00:29:01,803
You know what you are? You are like…

435
00:29:03,179 --> 00:29:04,831
a really great…

436
00:29:06,397 --> 00:29:07,637
little brother.

437
00:29:29,708 --> 00:29:33,795
- She’s really good. 
- Yeah! She’s really great

438
00:29:34,023 --> 00:29:36,654
I gotta bring my other boyfriends back to see her next time.

439
00:30:22,066 --> 00:30:22,839
Alright!

440
00:30:23,699 --> 00:30:25,128
Alright Haley!

441
00:30:29,604 --> 00:30:30,753
Thank you.

442
00:30:33,321 --> 00:30:33,971
Hey.

443
00:30:35,568 --> 00:30:38,745
I’m sorry. I had no idea that was gonna happen.

444
00:30:38,962 --> 00:30:40,611
And you don’t deserve any of it.

445
00:30:41,317 --> 00:30:43,990
It’s cool. Don’t worry about it.

446
00:30:45,163 --> 00:30:45,992
Are you sure?

447
00:30:50,575 --> 00:30:51,301
What?

448
00:30:52,331 --> 00:30:54,876
I just… wouldn’t mind seeing that picture again.

449
00:31:03,423 --> 00:31:05,034
What they hell are you doing to Brooke?

450
00:31:06,349 --> 00:31:07,148
One second.

451
00:31:10,450 --> 00:31:11,251
Is there a problem?

452
00:31:11,332 --> 00:31:13,425
- Brooke is back there, wasted and alone. 
- So?

453
00:31:13,507 --> 00:31:15,070
So why aren’t you doing something about it?

454
00:31:15,260 --> 00:31:17,230
And don’t say you don’t care because you do.

455
00:31:17,423 --> 00:31:19,488
Otherwise, why did you pay for the dollhouse?

456
00:31:20,788 --> 00:31:23,235
Look, I don’t need you to understand any of it Mouth.

457
00:31:23,394 --> 00:31:24,992
And the dollhouse is our secret.

458
00:31:25,509 --> 00:31:28,832
Now if you don’t mind, I’m having a crummy night. Theresa’s about to change that.

459
00:31:30,527 --> 00:31:31,264
Stop it Mouth!

460
00:31:32,308 --> 00:31:35,944
Hey! You got a problem with my friend?

461
00:31:36,702 --> 00:31:38,099
Maybe I got a problem with you.

462
00:31:38,657 --> 00:31:40,316
Yeah, I think you do.

463
00:31:46,250 --> 00:31:47,341
You’re lucky…

464
00:31:48,093 --> 00:31:49,864
I’m not gonna do this in here.

465
00:31:50,427 --> 00:31:51,605
That’s too bad.

466
00:31:54,356 --> 00:31:54,954
Coz I am.

467
00:32:03,198 --> 00:32:04,493
Felix! Stop it!

468
00:32:06,970 --> 00:32:09,172
Stop it! Felix!

469
00:32:10,376 --> 00:32:11,748
Get you damn hands off me!

470
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:13,294
Not until I get you outside.

471
00:32:13,770 --> 00:32:17,553
Oh right, everyone here’s related. I get tossed cos you’re the guy’s uncle.

472
00:32:17,672 --> 00:32:19,371
No, you get tossed because you’re an ass.

473
00:32:36,411 --> 00:32:38,009
So did you have fun tonight, mom?

474
00:32:38,203 --> 00:32:42,049
Sure, if you… don’t count the part where my son started punching people.

475
00:32:44,158 --> 00:32:45,130
I’m sorry.

476
00:32:46,452 --> 00:32:48,065
I didn’t mean to ruin your night.

477
00:32:48,530 --> 00:32:50,875
Yeah, well I didn’t mean to screw up your week.

478
00:32:51,095 --> 00:32:55,453
Then again, without the use of your cell phone, MP3 player and the car…

479
00:32:56,170 --> 00:32:57,571
it could suck for you.

480
00:32:59,170 --> 00:33:00,025
Trade!

481
00:33:05,494 --> 00:33:08,499
One week. Two, if you complain.

482
00:33:15,589 --> 00:33:16,537
How’re you doing?

483
00:33:18,103 --> 00:33:19,650
You should see the other guy.

484
00:33:22,797 --> 00:33:25,772
Well I’ve got my mom’s car so… I’m gonna take off.

485
00:33:26,714 --> 00:33:27,719
Are you sure?

486
00:33:28,293 --> 00:33:29,019
Yeah.

487
00:33:30,678 --> 00:33:32,971
But… thanks for punching Felix!

488
00:33:33,495 --> 00:33:35,214
I’ve wanted to do that for years.

489
00:33:36,053 --> 00:33:37,033
Anytime!

490
00:33:39,638 --> 00:33:40,581
Call me tomorrow?

491
00:33:42,128 --> 00:33:43,208
You tell me.

492
00:33:49,859 --> 00:33:51,011
Call me tomorrow.

493
00:33:58,461 --> 00:34:00,145
Alright, well I’m gonna go home mom.

494
00:34:00,390 --> 00:34:02,362
And don’t worry, I’m going straight home.

495
00:34:02,449 --> 00:34:03,907
Alright, no street fighting.

496
00:34:04,249 --> 00:34:05,015
Right.

497
00:34:05,951 --> 00:34:09,039
- Uhh… nice to meet you Andy. 
- Yeah, yeah, you too.

498
00:34:13,533 --> 00:34:16,150
So I guess that t-shirt I bought him is gonna fit a little snug.

499
00:34:18,028 --> 00:34:20,020
Ohh, right, that.

500
00:34:20,733 --> 00:34:22,179
Why didn’t you just tell me, Karen?

501
00:34:23,056 --> 00:34:27,777
I mean you’re… you’re son’s a teenager. Why do you think that would matter?

502
00:34:27,947 --> 00:34:29,620
Because it matters to me.

503
00:34:33,443 --> 00:34:35,335
Andy, I like you…

504
00:34:36,056 --> 00:34:40,428
but tonight, seeing you sitting there with Lucas, it just seemed so normal.

505
00:34:41,125 --> 00:34:42,232
Like friends.

506
00:34:43,906 --> 00:34:44,668
So?

507
00:34:45,190 --> 00:34:47,868
Well… so that makes sense to me.

508
00:34:49,399 --> 00:34:50,869
Look at us!

509
00:34:54,197 --> 00:34:56,797
I mean, does this picture look right to you?

510
00:34:59,552 --> 00:35:02,252
Yes. To me it does.

511
00:35:05,865 --> 00:35:09,501
But I think the… the more important question is…

512
00:35:11,261 --> 00:35:12,470
does it feel right?

513
00:35:25,952 --> 00:35:29,126
- That feels good. 
- Yeah. Yeah it does.

514
00:35:33,744 --> 00:35:35,064
The rest doesn’t matter.

515
00:35:38,528 --> 00:35:39,335
Good night.

516
00:35:49,404 --> 00:35:50,492
- Good job! 
- Thank you.

517
00:35:50,722 --> 00:35:52,458
- You were great. 
- We loved you.

518
00:35:53,190 --> 00:35:54,941
Oh, thanks so much!

519
00:35:56,032 --> 00:35:58,704
Predictable sappy ballad. How’s it feel?

520
00:35:59,271 --> 00:36:02,084
Uh… great till ya just… dissed me!

521
00:36:02,161 --> 00:36:03,691
No, look, you’ve got a good sound.

522
00:36:03,799 --> 00:36:07,556
And watching you tonight, I can definitely see us doing something together.

523
00:36:08,227 --> 00:36:09,078
Really?

524
00:36:09,482 --> 00:36:14,234
Yeah, I never joke about music. Here’s my number. I got some studio time coming up.

525
00:36:14,392 --> 00:36:16,471
Oh… wow okay.

526
00:36:18,069 --> 00:36:21,833
Oh! I just remembered THUD Magazine wanted me to do a… interview with them.

527
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:23,961
- It’s probably gonna take a little while and...
- Nah, it’s cool.

528
00:36:24,039 --> 00:36:25,043
- Okay. 
- This is your night.

529
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:27,121
- Go, enjoy and I’ll see you at home. 
- Are you sure?

530
00:36:27,204 --> 00:36:28,979
Yeah, I gotta work early tomorrow anyway.

531
00:36:29,127 --> 00:36:32,329
Okay. I love you. Thanks.

532
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:38,897
You have any idea how many guys in the room wanna nail your wife right now?

533
00:37:16,006 --> 00:37:17,251
Good night, Brooke.

534
00:37:24,478 --> 00:37:25,515
I love you.

535
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:31,265
Hey.

536
00:37:33,558 --> 00:37:35,167
I was just checking on her.

537
00:37:35,991 --> 00:37:37,168
She’s fine.

538
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:46,855
You like her, huh?

539
00:37:47,403 --> 00:37:48,274
Yeah.

540
00:37:49,589 --> 00:37:52,015
But guys like me don’t get girls like her and…

541
00:37:52,996 --> 00:37:54,766
guys like you don’t care.

542
00:37:55,355 --> 00:37:56,517
That’s not true.

543
00:37:58,688 --> 00:38:02,527
Look man… I owe you an apology.

544
00:38:08,821 --> 00:38:09,783
Friends?

545
00:38:15,173 --> 00:38:16,550
Just treat her right.

546
00:38:48,643 --> 00:38:49,734
Felix?

547
00:38:50,109 --> 00:38:50,927
Hey girl.

548
00:38:52,765 --> 00:38:53,729
You’re a mess.

549
00:38:56,115 --> 00:38:57,558
You took care of me?

550
00:39:00,727 --> 00:39:01,655
Yeah…

551
00:39:03,441 --> 00:39:05,412
Sometimes you gotta break the rules.

552
00:39:16,203 --> 00:39:17,884
So! How’d we do?

553
00:39:18,333 --> 00:39:21,151
Well… it’s a little early for exact numbers but…

554
00:39:21,284 --> 00:39:24,094
a few thousand nights like this and I think we can retire.

555
00:39:24,223 --> 00:39:25,461
Ah, works for me!

556
00:39:28,447 --> 00:39:30,940
Ah… Deb, I need to ask you a question.

557
00:39:31,467 --> 00:39:32,333
Of course.

558
00:39:32,757 --> 00:39:35,815
I mean, it’s stupid and considering the source, I shouldn’t even ask.

559
00:39:35,894 --> 00:39:37,970
I mean, I probably don’t even have the right ask but...

560
00:39:38,042 --> 00:39:39,348
Karen, we’re friends.

561
00:39:41,141 --> 00:39:42,107
Right.

562
00:39:45,629 --> 00:39:49,275
Yesterday, Dan told me that you slept with Keith.

563
00:39:51,646 --> 00:39:52,670
Is it true?

564
00:39:57,887 --> 00:39:59,327
No! Of course not!

565
00:40:08,993 --> 00:40:12,152
Well… that date had everything.

566
00:40:12,905 --> 00:40:16,883
Good conversation, dancing… fisticuffs.

567
00:40:17,825 --> 00:40:19,695
Yeah, I’m sorry about that part.

568
00:40:21,260 --> 00:40:23,659
So… I was thinking.

569
00:40:24,553 --> 00:40:26,257
You called me your girlfriend tonight.

570
00:40:27,256 --> 00:40:28,070
Yeah.

571
00:40:28,751 --> 00:40:32,007
Well… if we were exclusive,

572
00:40:32,735 --> 00:40:35,924
just you and me… would you be okay with that?

573
00:40:37,450 --> 00:40:38,915
I’d be great with that.

574
00:40:40,768 --> 00:40:42,921
Good. Me too.

575
00:40:52,297 --> 00:40:55,648
So what do you say, boyfriend? Wanna sleep over?

576
00:40:59,528 --> 00:41:00,136
Boy!

577
00:41:23,372 --> 00:41:26,805
- So… hell of a night huh? 
- Yes, I’m still shaking!

578
00:41:26,904 --> 00:41:29,706
Thank you so much for everything! And I’m sorry about earlier.

579
00:41:29,807 --> 00:41:32,748
No, dude, you totally redeemed yourself after indie-boy flaked on me!

580
00:41:32,833 --> 00:41:35,731
- Ha! You wanna get outta here? 
- Yes but, I gotta clear out some stragglers.

581
00:41:38,302 --> 00:41:41,522
Hey! Relax, they’re cool.

582
00:41:41,857 --> 00:41:43,728
In fact, Peyton and I did a couple lines the other night.

583
00:41:44,148 --> 00:41:45,299
Aint that right Peyton?

584
00:42:03,104 --> 00:42:04,455
What do you want, Felix?

585
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:07,270
You like my sister?

586
00:42:09,099 --> 00:42:10,538
You know I do.

587
00:42:11,065 --> 00:42:14,767
Too bad. Stay the hell away from her.

588
00:42:15,192 --> 00:42:16,410
Is that an order?

589
00:42:16,696 --> 00:42:19,344
No… it’s a warning!
