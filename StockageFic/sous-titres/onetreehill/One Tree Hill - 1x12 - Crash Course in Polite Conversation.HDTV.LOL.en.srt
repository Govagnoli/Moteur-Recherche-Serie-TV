1
00:01:56,147 --> 00:01:57,632
- Hey, honey.
- Hey, dad.

2
00:01:59,055 --> 00:02:00,893
What’s going on with the unibomber look?

3
00:02:01,267 --> 00:02:02,966
I was going for George Clooney.

4
00:02:03,045 --> 00:02:03,833
Go further.

5
00:02:05,744 --> 00:02:08,553
That’s right, you’re not used to seeing me like this.

6
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:12,676
See, when I’m on the job I usually let it grow then I shave it off right before I come home.

7
00:02:12,721 --> 00:02:13,929
Kind of a ritual for me.

8
00:02:14,001 --> 00:02:16,202
Well, make sure you find a razor day after tomorrow.

9
00:02:16,489 --> 00:02:19,227
And after that, I’m gonna be shaving a lot more often.

10
00:02:19,331 --> 00:02:19,919
Okay.

11
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:21,850
Hey Brooke. Hey rake boy.

12
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:25,010
I see nobody uses the doorbell still.

13
00:02:25,130 --> 00:02:27,890
Papa Peyton, the scruffy thing’s working for you.

14
00:02:28,076 --> 00:02:29,448
What are you guys up to so early?

15
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:33,405
- I don’t know. Peyton just asked us…
- Oh no, you know what? You’ll find out when you get home.

16
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:34,619
Not even a little hint?

17
00:02:34,686 --> 00:02:36,837
Uh Uh. Not even. I love you

18
00:02:37,308 --> 00:02:39,565
You better. Love you too, honey.

19
00:02:39,635 --> 00:02:40,307
Bye.

20
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:43,646
So, what’s the surprise?

21
00:02:45,162 --> 00:02:47,333
I need your help with something. Come on.

22
00:02:52,504 --> 00:02:55,622
Damn, that’s nice. Is this your dads?

23
00:02:55,873 --> 00:02:58,600
Yeah, he hasn’t driven it in like a year though.

24
00:02:58,946 --> 00:03:00,265
Do you think you can get it to run?

25
00:03:00,501 --> 00:03:01,448
Of course he can.

26
00:03:01,638 --> 00:03:04,761
And he’s going to look good doing it too in a tight little wife beater,

27
00:03:04,802 --> 00:03:06,252
maybe some grease smudges.

28
00:03:06,631 --> 00:03:09,789
And I was thinking maybe you could help me wash and wax.

29
00:03:09,877 --> 00:03:10,623
Glad to help.

30
00:03:11,591 --> 00:03:14,724
I just want to do something nice for him. Since he’s coming home.

31
00:03:16,625 --> 00:03:17,350
Alright,

32
00:03:18,743 --> 00:03:19,798
I’ll go get my tools.

33
00:03:24,233 --> 00:03:25,241
Surprise!

34
00:03:25,754 --> 00:03:27,182
You answer the door in your underwear?

35
00:03:27,253 --> 00:03:29,620
Grandma, Grandpa. What are you guys doing here?

36
00:03:30,484 --> 00:03:33,956
Royal, May, oh, what a surprise.

37
00:03:34,124 --> 00:03:37,566
Well, thanks for the warm welcome. I told you this ambush was a bad idea.

38
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:41,457
- He’s dragging me to another one of those auto conventions.
- Nobody’s dragging anybody anywhere.

39
00:03:41,524 --> 00:03:45,931
I told him that the only way I’d go is if we came by here for Danny’s birthday.

40
00:03:46,366 --> 00:03:48,834
Oh, Dan’s birthday, of course.

41
00:03:49,372 --> 00:03:50,052
Yeah.

42
00:03:51,569 --> 00:03:54,517
Well, you going to leave us standing out here all morning freezing our asses off?

43
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:55,387
- Oh…
- Come on in.

44
00:03:56,786 --> 00:03:57,564
Kiss Granny.

45
00:03:58,318 --> 00:04:00,779
Looks like you put on a few there, Deb. It looks good on you.

46
00:04:04,388 --> 00:04:05,006
Dan.

47
00:04:06,145 --> 00:04:08,024
You remembered. I’m touched.

48
00:04:08,163 --> 00:04:12,689
Oh I’m not here to wish you a happy birthday. But your parents are.

49
00:04:13,493 --> 00:04:14,088
What?

50
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,562
Yeah, they showed up at the house.

51
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:18,223
Apparently, you never told them that you’re not living there right now.

52
00:04:19,981 --> 00:04:21,190
How’d they take it?

53
00:04:22,074 --> 00:04:27,174
You think I told them? I’m not going to be on the receiving end of that. That’s your job.

54
00:04:27,394 --> 00:04:28,372
Well, how long are they here?

55
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:33,953
Just tonight. But it gets better. Your mother is cooking you a big birthday dinner.

56
00:04:34,363 --> 00:04:35,468
Oh perfect.

57
00:04:36,267 --> 00:04:37,568
Alright, so what are we going to do?

58
00:04:37,808 --> 00:04:42,432
We are not going to do anything. You are going to go to the house right now,

59
00:04:42,477 --> 00:04:45,739
- and tell them we’re separated. 
- No, we’re doing the counseling.

60
00:04:46,013 --> 00:04:48,181
We can work this thing out, right? Isn’t that the whole point?

61
00:04:48,647 --> 00:04:50,752
- It is.
- Well, you know how they are.

62
00:04:50,885 --> 00:04:53,056
Do you really want them weighing in on the state of our marriage?

63
00:04:54,824 --> 00:04:56,906
Do you remember when we told them we weren’t going to have any more kids?

64
00:04:56,975 --> 00:05:00,433
How many times did my dad call you? And now you don’t even have the option of hanging up on him.

65
00:05:01,626 --> 00:05:03,198
Go on, Dan. Just say it.

66
00:05:03,445 --> 00:05:05,882
We go through the motions tonight. Get it over with.

67
00:05:05,937 --> 00:05:08,113
Send them on their way. Go back to working on us.

68
00:05:09,603 --> 00:05:14,412
Besides, it might do us some good to try and remember what its like to be a normal family.

69
00:05:17,273 --> 00:05:19,853
Fine, just for tonight.

70
00:05:20,463 --> 00:05:21,400
Just for tonight.

71
00:05:32,029 --> 00:05:34,329
Good morning, Sir. Table or counter?

72
00:05:34,451 --> 00:05:36,914
Um, actually, I’m looking for Karen.

73
00:05:37,002 --> 00:05:39,536
Oh you know what? She’s in Italy right now. Cooking school.

74
00:05:41,189 --> 00:05:42,024
Good for her.

75
00:05:43,099 --> 00:05:44,590
How’s that boy of hers doing?

76
00:05:45,218 --> 00:05:46,319
Lucas is great.

77
00:05:47,523 --> 00:05:49,919
She calls in every once and a while. You want me to leave a message?

78
00:05:51,298 --> 00:05:54,491
No, that’s alright. I’ll just catch her the next time I’m passing through.

79
00:05:54,557 --> 00:05:57,742
Okay, can I tell her who stopped by? Mr…

80
00:05:58,818 --> 00:06:00,006
Just an old friend.

81
00:06:14,434 --> 00:06:18,167
Well, it’s not the battery. It’s probably the starter.

82
00:06:18,663 --> 00:06:20,128
Well, you can fix that, right?

83
00:06:20,945 --> 00:06:22,892
Yeah, it shouldn’t be a problem.

84
00:06:25,894 --> 00:06:27,142
It’s an amazing car.

85
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:29,656
It’s an amazing guy.

86
00:06:32,748 --> 00:06:34,503
Is that what you got me in this thing for?

87
00:06:34,892 --> 00:06:36,127
Yeah…

88
00:06:40,853 --> 00:06:42,747
I was, just getting started.

89
00:06:43,239 --> 00:06:44,749
Sadly, so was I.

90
00:06:46,624 --> 00:06:47,438
What’s wrong?

91
00:06:48,482 --> 00:06:49,629
I’m just worried about my dad.

92
00:06:51,809 --> 00:06:55,434
Okay, I just checked online and now they’re saying it’s a category 3 hurricane.

93
00:06:56,035 --> 00:06:58,025
Alright, and you already checked on the web cam, right?

94
00:06:58,138 --> 00:06:58,902
Yeah, its out.

95
00:06:59,138 --> 00:07:00,238
Well, maybe he turned it off.

96
00:07:00,592 --> 00:07:02,030
Or the storm did it for him.

97
00:07:02,198 --> 00:07:04,472
Yeah, but storms knock that kind of thing out all the time, right?

98
00:07:05,081 --> 00:07:06,832
Anyway, aren’t dredging boats huge?

99
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:08,123
He wouldn’t be on the dredging boat.

100
00:07:08,825 --> 00:07:11,819
Right  now, if there’s a storm headed his way, he’d be on this little tiny transport

101
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:13,703
heading back to shore and that’s what worries me.

102
00:07:14,675 --> 00:07:17,697
Okay, Peyton, just stop. Don’t do this to yourself, alright?

103
00:07:17,795 --> 00:07:20,355
Just because he hasn’t checked in doesn’t mean something’s happened.

104
00:07:21,286 --> 00:07:22,710
Doesn’t mean it hasn’t either.

105
00:07:29,130 --> 00:07:33,580
So this dinner thing’s gonna be pretty bad, huh?

106
00:07:33,714 --> 00:07:34,603
Massacre.

107
00:07:35,407 --> 00:07:38,839
My Grandma’s okay. It’s just my Grandpa’s pretty intense.

108
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:43,359
You’ve met my dad. Just imagine where he comes from.

109
00:07:43,641 --> 00:07:45,117
- Scary.
- Yeah.

110
00:07:46,673 --> 00:07:49,616
You  should come tonight. Maybe it will make everybody behave.

111
00:07:50,859 --> 00:07:53,062
I’ll come if you want me to.

112
00:07:53,476 --> 00:07:56,523
No, I wasn’t serious. I wouldn’t put you through that.

113
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:59,804
No I mean, if you’re asking, of course my answer’s yes.

114
00:08:00,875 --> 00:08:02,990
Well, then I’m asking.

115
00:08:03,429 --> 00:08:04,567
Well then I’m coming.

116
00:08:07,265 --> 00:08:10,497
Let me get this right, the charcoal finish, custom leather package,

117
00:08:10,628 --> 00:08:12,713
and what you want is a champaign interior.

118
00:08:13,214 --> 00:08:14,382
I’m here to see the manager.

119
00:08:15,027 --> 00:08:15,784
Excuse me

120
00:08:15,892 --> 00:08:18,354
Hey fellow, you ought to know who you’re doing business with.

121
00:08:18,682 --> 00:08:19,676
Is there a problem?

122
00:08:19,773 --> 00:08:22,968
Well, you’re buying from Dan Scott. Basketball legend.

123
00:08:23,106 --> 00:08:25,912
Still holds the all time scoring record for Tree Hill.

124
00:08:26,132 --> 00:08:27,648
Made all-state his Senior year.

125
00:08:27,725 --> 00:08:29,312
- No kidding.
- No kidding.

126
00:08:29,572 --> 00:08:32,988
- My dad.
- I figured. You play college too?

127
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:36,388
Would have, but he blew his knee out in his freshman year. He got robbed.

128
00:08:36,459 --> 00:08:37,658
Would have been one of the greats.

129
00:08:37,759 --> 00:08:39,358
Dad, Mr. Miller’s really not interested.

130
00:08:39,433 --> 00:08:41,753
I’ll tell you what, meet me in my office. Okay? I’ll be right in.

131
00:08:41,819 --> 00:08:44,821
- Yeah.
- Champaign interior, right? Alright.

132
00:08:45,615 --> 00:08:47,590
What? Somebody’s got to brag on you.

133
00:08:47,693 --> 00:08:51,088
And you’re not going to close that sale without your old mans help you know that, don’t you?

134
00:08:51,308 --> 00:08:52,858
You know you always were my biggest promoter.

135
00:08:53,324 --> 00:08:55,440
Yeah well.

136
00:08:55,808 --> 00:08:57,744
Hey still in shape. Good for you.

137
00:09:03,728 --> 00:09:08,305
Oh you’re home. Listen, I called Nathan. I told him not to tell Dad that he’s not going to practice.

138
00:09:08,403 --> 00:09:09,725
You mean that he quit the team?

139
00:09:09,888 --> 00:09:10,893
You know what I mean.

140
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:13,600
I also told Keith to avoid the subject.

141
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:16,110
Any other lies I should remember to tell?

142
00:09:16,493 --> 00:09:18,740
I’m trying to protect our son from my father, okay?

143
00:09:19,063 --> 00:09:20,819
You don’t even see the irony, do you?

144
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:23,540
Mom, you look beautiful as ever.

145
00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:25,300
God bless you for a liar.

146
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,410
When I compliment you, you call me a liar.

147
00:09:27,496 --> 00:09:28,391
You look tired.

148
00:09:28,581 --> 00:09:31,274
Hey, son, what’s the deal? No more Charlotte hornets?

149
00:09:31,337 --> 00:09:34,152
Yeah, New Orleans can have them. You think they have playoffs hope?

150
00:09:34,229 --> 00:09:35,253
No, no.

151
00:09:35,586 --> 00:09:37,921
- No sports talk.
- Oh, come on.

152
00:09:38,256 --> 00:09:43,000
Yes ma’am. I just became head of the table then, huh?

153
00:09:43,102 --> 00:09:43,771
- Keith!
- Mom!

154
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:46,747
You look great.

155
00:09:46,952 --> 00:09:49,384
Well, look what the cat dragged in.

156
00:09:49,671 --> 00:09:51,099
It’s good to see you too, dad.

157
00:09:52,512 --> 00:09:53,987
Happy birthday, Danny.

158
00:09:54,730 --> 00:09:55,722
Yeah, thanks.

159
00:09:56,323 --> 00:09:59,293
Come on, have a seat. Dinner is almost ready.

160
00:09:59,379 --> 00:10:00,135
Hey Deb.

161
00:10:00,787 --> 00:10:02,538
Danny will you pour some wine, please?

162
00:10:02,661 --> 00:10:04,268
- I’m on it. 
- Amen to that.

163
00:10:04,366 --> 00:10:08,436
Uh, listen mom, we’re going to need another place setting, I invited a guest.

164
00:10:08,881 --> 00:10:13,181
A date! Oh my goodness, well you get that chair over there…

165
00:10:13,335 --> 00:10:15,261
Grandpa, Grandma, this is Haley.

166
00:10:15,368 --> 00:10:16,889
- Oh Haley.
- Hi.

167
00:10:17,232 --> 00:10:19,439
- Nice to meet you. 
- Nice to meet you too.

168
00:10:24,349 --> 00:10:26,853
Well, Nathan, you’re looking more and more like your old man every day.

169
00:10:26,949 --> 00:10:29,992
We all know where he gets his good looks, don’t we? Well, come on in.

170
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,806
- You sit right here next to me, hun. 
- Thank You.

171
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:34,087
I’ll get it.

172
00:10:35,739 --> 00:10:37,830
Oh my goodness, Whitey!

173
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:41,722
- Good to see you.
- Good evening everybody. Sorry I’m late

174
00:10:43,645 --> 00:10:44,902
Glad you came?

175
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:46,048
Yeah.

176
00:10:51,034 --> 00:10:52,182
Alright, try it again.

177
00:10:55,232 --> 00:10:56,618
We got power!

178
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:57,552
Whooo.

179
00:10:57,635 --> 00:10:58,875
Peyton, come check it out.

180
00:11:03,293 --> 00:11:04,189
What is it?

181
00:11:05,709 --> 00:11:06,907
I just got a phone call.

182
00:11:07,102 --> 00:11:09,343
Um, it’s the storm.

183
00:11:10,287 --> 00:11:11,941
My dad’s transport is missing.

184
00:11:13,297 --> 00:11:14,419
There were three guys on it.

185
00:11:15,085 --> 00:11:16,307
They recovered a body.

186
00:11:17,346 --> 00:11:18,294
What’d they tell you?

187
00:11:20,490 --> 00:11:22,016
I have to go see if it’s him.

188
00:11:31,002 --> 00:11:33,394
Alright, you sure you shouldn’t call your Grandma?

189
00:11:33,476 --> 00:11:37,074
No she’d freak out. I’d rather not upset her. Besides, its not going to be my dad.

190
00:11:37,238 --> 00:11:38,037
Of course its not.

191
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:41,436
Let’s go ahead and get this over with. We have a 4 hour drive ahead of us.

192
00:11:42,097 --> 00:11:44,202
A 4 hour drive into a storm?

193
00:11:44,843 --> 00:11:48,384
Well the storms passing through. By the time we get there it should be gone.

194
00:11:48,456 --> 00:11:52,706
Okay, wait a second. Shouldn’t somebody stay here by the phone? I mean, incase your dad calls.

195
00:11:52,804 --> 00:11:54,979
I will. You go with Peyton.

196
00:11:55,399 --> 00:11:56,147
You sure?

197
00:11:56,315 --> 00:11:59,700
Yeah. Lucas you’re good in crisis, not that there’s going to be one.

198
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:05,311
But I would probably end up falling apart and you’d end up taking care of me which is not the point, so…

199
00:12:06,977 --> 00:12:08,147
I love you.

200
00:12:08,890 --> 00:12:09,976
It’s  going to be okay.

201
00:12:11,348 --> 00:12:12,176
You’re the best.

202
00:12:16,755 --> 00:12:18,567
I’ll call you guys if I hear anything.

203
00:12:21,143 --> 00:12:22,827
So, how’s the team doing this year, Whitey?

204
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:24,798
Oh we’re still undefeated actually.

205
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:28,847
Dad, you still rooting for the Magic these days?

206
00:12:28,921 --> 00:12:33,886
Please! No talk of sports until after dinner, okay?

207
00:12:33,973 --> 00:12:34,869
Good idea mom.

208
00:12:35,426 --> 00:12:36,165
Sorry.

209
00:12:37,517 --> 00:12:39,769
Well, Nathan, what are you averaging these days?

210
00:12:40,006 --> 00:12:43,246
You know your dad had 27 and a half a game. You beat that yet?

211
00:12:43,317 --> 00:12:46,225
- Royal, we just said…
- I’m asking the boy a question, May.

212
00:12:49,511 --> 00:12:52,288
Uh well maybe you should ask the old man.

213
00:12:56,665 --> 00:12:58,545
24 points a game I think, isn’t it?

214
00:12:58,698 --> 00:13:00,239
So, 24 a game huh?

215
00:13:00,485 --> 00:13:03,076
You’re gonna have to get that up if you’re going to beat the old man.

216
00:13:03,842 --> 00:13:07,684
Yeah, your dads star would have risen through the roof at Carolina

217
00:13:07,736 --> 00:13:10,004
if it wasn’t for that damn knee of his. How’re your knees?

218
00:13:11,155 --> 00:13:13,259
- No worries.
- Oh, he’s got great knees.

219
00:13:17,065 --> 00:13:23,280
Uh huh. Of course Danny takes after his old man. Never let adversity stop him.

220
00:13:24,017 --> 00:13:26,956
Too bad Keith takes after his mothers side of the family.

221
00:13:27,413 --> 00:13:28,589
Lucky for him.

222
00:13:28,989 --> 00:13:31,411
I’d drink to that, but I have to get a refill.

223
00:13:34,203 --> 00:13:35,757
Well, I should see about the cake.

224
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:37,215
I’ll go do that, Mrs. Scott.

225
00:13:38,338 --> 00:13:40,882
- Want to come help?
- Yeah, the cake, right.

226
00:13:46,841 --> 00:13:48,420
I warned you, it was going to be intense.

227
00:13:48,532 --> 00:13:51,270
Oh, insane is more like it.

228
00:13:51,782 --> 00:13:56,047
You know, there’s a door right there. We could sneak out, nobody would even notice.

229
00:13:56,161 --> 00:13:56,811
Tempting.

230
00:13:58,225 --> 00:14:02,392
Um, so how often do your grandparents come into town?

231
00:14:03,145 --> 00:14:04,599
Couple times a year. Why?

232
00:14:07,226 --> 00:14:08,837
Haley, you’ve got that look.

233
00:14:09,848 --> 00:14:10,506
What look?

234
00:14:10,605 --> 00:14:13,471
The look you get when you want to tell me something but you don’t really want to tell me.

235
00:14:13,548 --> 00:14:15,697
No I don’t, and you shouldn’t know that look yet.

236
00:14:15,817 --> 00:14:16,589
What is it?

237
00:14:18,335 --> 00:14:22,815
Your grandfather came by the café today. And he asked for Karen.

238
00:14:23,251 --> 00:14:24,542
- He did?
- Yeah.

239
00:14:24,674 --> 00:14:26,926
I just kind of got the feeling like they’ve been keeping in touch.

240
00:14:28,239 --> 00:14:29,661
Does Lucas know?

241
00:14:29,866 --> 00:14:33,455
No, they’ve never even met. But your grandfather asked about him.

242
00:14:34,311 --> 00:14:35,775
That doesn’t make any sense.

243
00:14:36,306 --> 00:14:39,790
My grandpa acts like my dad’s a second coming, why would he visit Karen?

244
00:14:40,045 --> 00:14:42,758
I don’t know, I don’t want to start anything, I’m just telling you.

245
00:14:43,337 --> 00:14:45,943
You know what? My family’s so screwed up,

246
00:14:46,009 --> 00:14:48,897
nothing new would make a difference right now. Don’t worry about it.

247
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,570
You warm enough?

248
00:14:58,215 --> 00:14:58,989
I’m okay.

249
00:14:59,548 --> 00:15:01,564
I should probably get the heater fixed in here, huh?

250
00:15:02,390 --> 00:15:06,070
You know, I could have Keith take a look at it for you. I mean he’s really good at that stuff.

251
00:15:09,899 --> 00:15:11,169
You want me to stop and get some coffee?

252
00:15:12,019 --> 00:15:14,247
I’m fine. Thanks.

253
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:20,764
Thanks for doing this for me, Luke.

254
00:15:22,832 --> 00:15:24,030
It’s what friends are for, right?

255
00:15:25,874 --> 00:15:26,637
Yeah.

256
00:15:36,004 --> 00:15:36,939
Now what?

257
00:15:43,891 --> 00:15:44,916
What’s going on?

258
00:15:45,530 --> 00:15:47,877
Bridge is up cause of the storm. It’ll be open in the morning.

259
00:15:48,587 --> 00:15:51,106
Alright, we have an emergency, we have to get across the bridge.

260
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:53,445
I’m sorry Miss, but it’s not safe.

261
00:15:53,850 --> 00:15:56,256
Okay, um, is there another way through?

262
00:15:56,492 --> 00:15:59,256
Only the ferries, but the channel’s too rough so they’re not running.

263
00:15:59,324 --> 00:16:00,399
Well, what are we supposed to do?

264
00:16:00,522 --> 00:16:03,803
Hopefully they’ll be able to open the bridge in the morning. 6 a.m.

265
00:16:04,505 --> 00:16:06,685
There’s a motel right down the road.

266
00:16:06,774 --> 00:16:08,805
Might want to grab yourselves a room before they’re all gone.

267
00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:22,339
There you go!

268
00:16:25,417 --> 00:16:27,064
So, Nate. How’s your game this year?

269
00:16:27,330 --> 00:16:28,354
Here we go again.

270
00:16:28,446 --> 00:16:33,187
Just cover your ears, May, I just want to know how my grandson’s doing on the team.

271
00:16:33,258 --> 00:16:36,423
- Well I already told you, dad.
- No you didn’t, you didn’t tell me jack.

272
00:16:36,475 --> 00:16:39,111
And every time I mention it you change the damn subject.

273
00:16:40,366 --> 00:16:42,592
Now will somebody around here tell me what’s going on?

274
00:16:44,227 --> 00:16:45,010
Nathan?

275
00:16:46,827 --> 00:16:48,450
Whitey? Anybody?

276
00:16:49,187 --> 00:16:51,696
Nathan, I think you better take this one.

277
00:16:55,809 --> 00:16:57,329
I quit the team, alright?

278
00:16:57,682 --> 00:16:59,822
You quit the… what do you mean you quit the team?

279
00:16:59,945 --> 00:17:02,469
He didn’t quit the team dad, he’s just taking some time off.

280
00:17:02,541 --> 00:17:05,443
No, he’s not. Please stop lying, Dan.

281
00:17:06,350 --> 00:17:09,970
Were you ever going to tell me this? I mean that’s a hell of a thing to keep to yourself.

282
00:17:10,077 --> 00:17:11,281
Yeah, you’re one to talk.

283
00:17:11,352 --> 00:17:12,402
What’s that supposed to mean?

284
00:17:12,479 --> 00:17:16,278
I know you visit Karen at the café, alright? What’s that about?

285
00:17:16,348 --> 00:17:18,141
- Nathan! 
- That’s none of your damn business.

286
00:17:18,772 --> 00:17:21,469
- I guess somebody’s got a big mouth.
- You shut up, Grandpa

287
00:17:21,537 --> 00:17:24,567
- Don’t you talk to me like that.
- Back off, Royal.

288
00:17:24,624 --> 00:17:28,509
I’ve had enough of your crap. Nathan is not the problem.

289
00:17:28,915 --> 00:17:30,901
Would someone please explain?

290
00:17:37,109 --> 00:17:41,488
Dan has been riding Nathan for the past 6 years about that damn game.

291
00:17:41,541 --> 00:17:42,518
Deb stop.

292
00:17:42,579 --> 00:17:46,183
Riding him so hard, that Nathan took drugs so that he could measure up.

293
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:46,830
Drugs?

294
00:17:46,876 --> 00:17:48,933
Until he had to be rushed to the hospital.

295
00:17:49,717 --> 00:17:54,944
He could have died because of this insane pressure to put a ball through a hoop.

296
00:17:56,106 --> 00:17:58,534
But none of that is my sons fault, Royal.

297
00:17:59,752 --> 00:18:00,864
It’s your sons.

298
00:18:04,602 --> 00:18:10,396
Danny. You of all people. How dare you!

299
00:18:10,673 --> 00:18:14,589
You know how much you hated it when your daddy bullied you to be better.

300
00:18:14,646 --> 00:18:16,009
I  never bullied him.

301
00:18:17,355 --> 00:18:20,816
And when you wanted a way out, I gave you one.

302
00:18:20,882 --> 00:18:25,072
All these years. I protected you. I lied for you.

303
00:18:25,147 --> 00:18:27,913
And now you’re doing the same thing to your son?

304
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:29,454
What lie? What are you talking about?

305
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:34,707
In college. His knee injury. It wasn’t permanent.

306
00:18:36,755 --> 00:18:39,633
Danny quit. And I helped him.

307
00:18:48,423 --> 00:18:50,523
- What do you mean, he quit?
- It’s not like that, dad.

308
00:18:50,594 --> 00:18:53,498
Oh stop it, Dan. It’s time the truth came out.

309
00:18:53,562 --> 00:18:56,087
Will somebody tell me what in knee hell is going on here?

310
00:18:56,150 --> 00:18:58,951
You were on the road when Danny hurt his knee.

311
00:18:59,881 --> 00:19:01,039
So we lied.

312
00:19:01,842 --> 00:19:05,041
- You told me it was degenerative knee condition…
- It was Dad, it was...

313
00:19:05,136 --> 00:19:07,014
You looked me in the eye and told me that.

314
00:19:09,767 --> 00:19:15,191
Don’t you see, Royal? He was never going to be the star that you wanted him to be.

315
00:19:15,458 --> 00:19:17,147
You just couldn’t see that.

316
00:19:17,909 --> 00:19:19,989
The boy had two choices.

317
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:24,146
To fail in front of you or to quit.

318
00:19:25,125 --> 00:19:26,794
Either way he lost.

319
00:19:32,717 --> 00:19:34,228
So you just quit.

320
00:19:34,858 --> 00:19:37,541
Without even being man enough to own up to it.

321
00:19:37,684 --> 00:19:38,759
There’s more to the story, dad.

322
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:40,781
- You don’t know the whole story! 
- I’ve had enough.

323
00:19:41,611 --> 00:19:43,771
Me too. Come on, Haley. I’ll take you home.

324
00:19:43,832 --> 00:19:44,815
Thanks for dinner.

325
00:19:45,619 --> 00:19:49,435
Well, I can show myself out. Thank you, May.

326
00:19:50,779 --> 00:19:51,584
Deb.

327
00:19:55,011 --> 00:19:56,991
Happy Birthday, Danny.

328
00:19:59,994 --> 00:20:02,183
- Danny, don’t you…
- Why?

329
00:20:08,946 --> 00:20:11,569
Well, I guess I’ll do the dishes.

330
00:20:22,330 --> 00:20:26,687
Alright, lets just try to get some sleep, then we’ll be at the bridge as soon as it opens up.

331
00:20:26,831 --> 00:20:27,993
What did he say? 6 a.m.?

332
00:20:28,812 --> 00:20:29,860
We’ll be there at 5.

333
00:20:35,315 --> 00:20:36,032
What?

334
00:20:37,219 --> 00:20:39,278
We’re in a hurry to find out if my dad’s dead.

335
00:20:40,358 --> 00:20:41,853
It’s just kind of surreal.

336
00:20:46,824 --> 00:20:48,381
Yeah, it’s pretty messed up.

337
00:20:49,733 --> 00:20:53,055
You know how in dreams, you’re always trying to get to some place you need to be

338
00:20:53,156 --> 00:20:54,653
but you never really get there?

339
00:20:55,001 --> 00:20:55,677
Yeah.

340
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:03,849
I wish I could wake up.

341
00:21:07,105 --> 00:21:08,717
Maybe we should try to get some sleep.

342
00:21:09,532 --> 00:21:10,664
You think you can?

343
00:21:11,712 --> 00:21:12,686
Okay.

344
00:21:16,769 --> 00:21:18,626
I’ll just sleep on the floor, alright?

345
00:21:18,708 --> 00:21:19,624
Don’t be stupid.

346
00:21:39,350 --> 00:21:40,416
Look, Peyton.

347
00:21:43,073 --> 00:21:47,472
I just wish there was something I could do, or say to help you through this.

348
00:21:48,659 --> 00:21:49,725
You already have.

349
00:21:51,461 --> 00:21:52,659
Thanks Lucas.

350
00:22:03,351 --> 00:22:04,378
Goodnight.

351
00:22:17,352 --> 00:22:18,663
Sorry you had to see that.

352
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,644
Oh, it’s okay.

353
00:22:21,479 --> 00:22:23,091
It helped me understand you.

354
00:22:31,309 --> 00:22:36,582
You know, growing up, there were just certain things that were just carved into stone.

355
00:22:37,167 --> 00:22:41,519
And the main one was that Dan Scott would have been a pro if he didn’t blow out his knee.

356
00:22:43,035 --> 00:22:48,958
So, all this time, he just has been feeding me this line of crap about how great he would have been.

357
00:22:50,545 --> 00:22:52,512
And how I’d never be as good as him.

358
00:22:55,668 --> 00:22:56,627
Bastard.

359
00:22:58,236 --> 00:23:00,438
At least you know the truth though, right?

360
00:23:04,405 --> 00:23:05,926
I just don’t know what to do with it.

361
00:23:07,533 --> 00:23:10,210
Okay, goodnight.

362
00:23:10,491 --> 00:23:11,281
Goodnight.

363
00:23:11,973 --> 00:23:13,273
I’m here if you need me, okay?

364
00:23:19,013 --> 00:23:22,745
Hey, remember how I said “My family’s so screwed up,

365
00:23:23,617 --> 00:23:25,141
nothing new would make a difference”?

366
00:23:25,716 --> 00:23:26,539
Yeah.

367
00:23:28,101 --> 00:23:28,915
I was wrong.

368
00:23:48,074 --> 00:23:50,564
- You want to hear my side of it?
- Why should I believe it?

369
00:23:51,874 --> 00:23:54,960
This whole time you’ve been riding me you’ve known exactly the way I feel.

370
00:23:56,016 --> 00:23:58,791
Now that that’s in my head it just makes it that much worse.

371
00:24:03,809 --> 00:24:05,431
I was a great player, Nathan.

372
00:24:06,255 --> 00:24:07,177
In high school.

373
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:11,457
But when I got to Carolina, I knew it wasn’t going to be the same.

374
00:24:14,463 --> 00:24:16,015
My dad couldn’t see it though.

375
00:24:16,471 --> 00:24:17,961
It was hard on your grandmother too.

376
00:24:19,266 --> 00:24:24,038
So when I got hurt, she came to me and pleaded with me to walk away.

377
00:24:24,811 --> 00:24:26,618
She said it would be better for all of us.

378
00:24:28,989 --> 00:24:29,926
So I did.

379
00:24:32,737 --> 00:24:34,248
Worst decision of my life.

380
00:24:36,633 --> 00:24:38,648
It felt good to get out from underneath my father.

381
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:43,422
And after a while I realized I wasn’t playing for him at all.

382
00:24:45,424 --> 00:24:47,303
The game meant the world to me.

383
00:24:48,241 --> 00:24:50,667
I just never took the time to stand back and realize that.

384
00:24:52,183 --> 00:24:55,429
So I tried to get back into it. Rehab, running, weights.

385
00:24:56,694 --> 00:24:57,635
But it was too late.

386
00:24:58,771 --> 00:25:00,262
My knee never responded.

387
00:25:02,776 --> 00:25:03,898
It was over for me.

388
00:25:05,765 --> 00:25:08,612
So you think that somehow gives you the right to hammer me all the time.

389
00:25:09,309 --> 00:25:11,163
I know I push you. I know I’m hard on you.

390
00:25:11,849 --> 00:25:15,140
But I’m trying to save you from a life of regret. And Trust me, you don’t want it.

391
00:25:15,207 --> 00:25:17,164
So then you make me feel like crap all the time.

392
00:25:19,016 --> 00:25:20,277
That really helps, dad.

393
00:25:20,465 --> 00:25:23,118
I could have been stronger. But I push you so you will be.

394
00:25:23,180 --> 00:25:25,268
So things will end up better for you than they did for me.

395
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:26,476
Then you’re safe, dad.

396
00:25:28,192 --> 00:25:30,414
There’s no way I’m ever going to end up like you.

397
00:25:51,543 --> 00:25:52,497
Hey.

398
00:25:53,103 --> 00:25:53,802
Hey.

399
00:25:54,594 --> 00:25:55,501
What you got?

400
00:25:57,583 --> 00:26:00,560
‘To my heart, love Dad’

401
00:26:01,846 --> 00:26:03,326
He gave it to me on my last birthday.

402
00:26:07,123 --> 00:26:08,579
What if it’s him, Lucas?

403
00:26:09,526 --> 00:26:12,040
- It’s not gonna be.
- Cause I don’t know what I’d do.

404
00:26:12,551 --> 00:26:13,422
It’s going to be okay.

405
00:26:15,684 --> 00:26:19,429
I just keep trying to picture walking into that room and seeing him lying there.

406
00:26:20,703 --> 00:26:21,906
But I hit a wall.

407
00:26:24,589 --> 00:26:29,862
Why does it seem like every time things are finally going to be okay, something terrible happens?

408
00:26:30,078 --> 00:26:31,848
You don’t know that it has.

409
00:26:41,003 --> 00:26:42,872
Keep him close to your heart, Peyton.

410
00:26:45,772 --> 00:26:47,050
Get some sleep, okay?

411
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:10,732
You can sleep in the bedroom, I’ll stay out here tonight.

412
00:27:15,202 --> 00:27:23,475
Has it ever once bothered your conscience that our entire relationship is based on your lie?

413
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:30,920
When you were forced to walk away because of your so-called injury, I dropped out too.

414
00:27:31,011 --> 00:27:34,125
We both dropped out to raise Nathan. Don’t rewrite history.

415
00:27:34,442 --> 00:27:36,689
Oh, so you’re the only one who can play that game?

416
00:27:37,608 --> 00:27:40,848
I thought I knew the man I was choosing to spend my life with.

417
00:27:41,165 --> 00:27:42,671
The injury was real, Deb.

418
00:27:43,785 --> 00:27:46,837
And yes, I decided not to rehab it, at first.

419
00:27:47,795 --> 00:27:49,955
By the time I changed my mind it was too late.

420
00:27:51,057 --> 00:27:53,725
I did it in service to you and Nathan.

421
00:27:54,943 --> 00:27:58,306
Now I know how you’d hold it against me for not telling you, but...

422
00:27:58,833 --> 00:28:00,658
did you ever think that maybe I did it...

423
00:28:02,318 --> 00:28:03,703
to protect you from it all?

424
00:28:06,877 --> 00:28:08,664
If that’s what you need to believe.

425
00:28:09,166 --> 00:28:10,140
It’s the truth.

426
00:28:12,059 --> 00:28:13,139
The truth.

427
00:28:14,444 --> 00:28:15,720
In this house?

428
00:28:40,383 --> 00:28:41,326
What’s all this?

429
00:28:41,469 --> 00:28:44,376
Oh, sorry, I didn’t mean to wake you.

430
00:28:44,818 --> 00:28:45,985
I wasn’t asleep.

431
00:28:47,112 --> 00:28:48,135
I hit the vending machines.

432
00:28:49,267 --> 00:28:49,916
Hungry?

433
00:28:52,242 --> 00:28:53,373
You should probably eat something.

434
00:28:59,199 --> 00:29:03,725
After my mom died, my dad couldn’t cook.

435
00:29:04,134 --> 00:29:08,139
So, we lived on frozen pizzas for the longest time.

436
00:29:09,235 --> 00:29:10,591
I could live on pizza.

437
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:15,984
He’d buy these cheese pizzas, and then put his own toppings on.

438
00:29:16,663 --> 00:29:19,889
Pickles, bologna, pineapple, whatever.

439
00:29:20,166 --> 00:29:21,062
That’s nasty.

440
00:29:21,339 --> 00:29:23,208
No actually they were really good.

441
00:29:25,738 --> 00:29:27,975
I think he did it mostly just to make me laugh.

442
00:29:29,166 --> 00:29:31,102
You know it would help me forget for a little bit.

443
00:29:42,426 --> 00:29:43,298
You ready?

444
00:29:45,751 --> 00:29:46,387
No.

445
00:29:51,291 --> 00:29:52,187
Let’s go.

446
00:30:09,633 --> 00:30:10,582
Morning.

447
00:30:10,686 --> 00:30:11,387
Morning.

448
00:30:12,489 --> 00:30:14,207
Scrambled or fried? What do you think?

449
00:30:14,826 --> 00:30:17,895
I think nobody’s going to be that hungry.

450
00:30:19,246 --> 00:30:21,827
I’m glad you stood up to Royal the way you did, Deb.

451
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:28,361
I didn’t mean to hurt Dan but, this lying over the years has gotten so tiresome

452
00:30:28,412 --> 00:30:31,105
I did what I thought I had to do to save my son.

453
00:30:32,093 --> 00:30:33,070
That’s what we do.

454
00:30:34,577 --> 00:30:36,148
I’m glad you spoke up.

455
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:40,224
Dan.

456
00:30:42,610 --> 00:30:46,668
Son, you know, someday you’re going to realize I did you a favor.

457
00:30:47,421 --> 00:30:49,885
Your daddy’s going to get over this eventually.

458
00:30:50,355 --> 00:30:54,186
But if you let history repeat itself, your son may not.

459
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,076
I’m going for a run.

460
00:30:59,936 --> 00:31:02,501
Oh well. I think I’ll scramble the eggs.

461
00:31:02,713 --> 00:31:03,444
Yeah.

462
00:31:09,171 --> 00:31:10,426
Listen, Nathan,

463
00:31:12,818 --> 00:31:14,313
whatever you’re going through,

464
00:31:17,785 --> 00:31:19,177
I’m sorry about your dad.

465
00:31:20,528 --> 00:31:22,121
I understand why he did it, grandpa.

466
00:31:25,362 --> 00:31:27,026
He must have really loved you, you know that?

467
00:31:28,121 --> 00:31:30,287
Cause anything seemed better than disappointing you.

468
00:31:57,569 --> 00:31:58,585
It’s not him.

469
00:32:10,403 --> 00:32:11,406
You did good.

470
00:32:11,669 --> 00:32:13,520
I felt like my chest was going to explode.

471
00:32:23,136 --> 00:32:24,990
- Peyton’s place.
- Hey, its me.

472
00:32:25,056 --> 00:32:27,116
Hey I was just dialing you, that’s freaky.

473
00:32:27,386 --> 00:32:28,543
Well it’s good news.

474
00:32:28,728 --> 00:32:32,362
Yeah I know, I just got off the phone with the coast guard, they made contact with his boat, he’s fine.

475
00:32:33,818 --> 00:32:35,553
They found your dad, he’s okay.

476
00:32:39,574 --> 00:32:40,811
Alright, we’re headed home.

477
00:32:41,155 --> 00:32:43,432
Okay, I’m waiting. Love you.

478
00:32:43,514 --> 00:32:48,388
- Alright you too. Bye.
- Oh my God, that’s… wait.

479
00:32:48,465 --> 00:32:49,029
What?

480
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:53,232
My bracelet, I must have left it in the motel.

481
00:32:53,601 --> 00:32:54,763
Alright, lets go.

482
00:32:58,300 --> 00:32:59,802
- Hey.
- Hey.

483
00:32:59,853 --> 00:33:03,641
Grandma’s making breakfast. Show starts at 9. You in?

484
00:33:03,738 --> 00:33:07,568
Um, as fun as last night was, I think I’m going to pass.

485
00:33:09,627 --> 00:33:12,259
You know, I’ve been thinking.

486
00:33:13,441 --> 00:33:17,814
Now that you know the truth about your dad, you’re free, right?

487
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:22,186
I mean, he’s been lying to you all this time. You don’t have to listen to him anymore.

488
00:33:23,144 --> 00:33:24,317
There’s no more pressure.

489
00:33:25,422 --> 00:33:27,532
Yeah, I wish that were true.

490
00:33:28,589 --> 00:33:29,672
What do you mean?

491
00:33:32,265 --> 00:33:36,389
My dad walked away, and his father will never forgive him for that.

492
00:33:37,418 --> 00:33:38,584
I have to go back.

493
00:33:38,847 --> 00:33:41,038
- Nathan, I…
- I have to beat him, Haley.

494
00:33:43,013 --> 00:33:45,723
It’s the only way I’m ever going to be free of my dad.

495
00:33:53,925 --> 00:33:55,011
It has to be in here.

496
00:34:02,690 --> 00:34:03,637
Got it?

497
00:34:06,990 --> 00:34:08,497
Hey, it’s okay.

498
00:34:09,295 --> 00:34:10,678
Everything’s okay now, okay?

499
00:35:38,758 --> 00:35:42,672
- Ow. Ow. My hair.
- Sorry.

500
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:46,982
There.

501
00:35:52,075 --> 00:35:52,981
Brooke.

502
00:35:54,841 --> 00:35:55,506
What?

503
00:35:59,223 --> 00:36:00,825
Brooke gave me that necklace.

504
00:36:07,313 --> 00:36:08,307
You know, we…

505
00:36:10,845 --> 00:36:12,201
we probably should get going.

506
00:36:13,913 --> 00:36:14,506
Yeah.

507
00:36:16,805 --> 00:36:17,384
Okay.

508
00:36:43,501 --> 00:36:44,689
How’s business, Keith?

509
00:36:46,399 --> 00:36:47,387
It’s pretty steady.

510
00:36:48,336 --> 00:36:48,924
Good.

511
00:36:51,381 --> 00:36:54,525
I know I rib you a lot son, but I hope you know I think you’re a good man.

512
00:36:56,093 --> 00:36:57,198
That’s great, dad.

513
00:36:58,344 --> 00:37:01,058
The first nice thing you say to me and its really just to dig at Dan.

514
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:04,842
- Now son…
- Please, could we just eat our breakfast?

515
00:37:11,454 --> 00:37:14,759
Dan, you forgot to open your presents.

516
00:37:15,410 --> 00:37:17,233
This is from your dad and me.

517
00:37:19,577 --> 00:37:20,802
Oh, okay.

518
00:37:34,318 --> 00:37:35,347
What’s this?

519
00:37:36,157 --> 00:37:39,628
It’s a quilt. A lady in Orlando made it.

520
00:37:40,241 --> 00:37:45,874
We still had all your old basketball stuff and I just couldn’t bring myself to throw them out.

521
00:37:46,898 --> 00:37:50,359
You see son, you still have a lot to be proud of.

522
00:38:02,367 --> 00:38:03,722
It’s almost over, Deb.

523
00:38:04,219 --> 00:38:05,320
Thank God for that.

524
00:38:10,654 --> 00:38:14,890
Look, after all that has happened I want to thank you for not throwing gas on the fire.

525
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:18,924
You okay?

526
00:38:19,953 --> 00:38:23,701
No, no, Dan I’m not. And we’re not.

527
00:38:25,339 --> 00:38:29,031
All this pretending and lying, I can’t really hold it against you.

528
00:38:29,103 --> 00:38:31,402
- Deb…
- Because I realized all these years,

529
00:38:34,089 --> 00:38:35,509
I’ve been doing it too.

530
00:38:56,374 --> 00:38:58,164
- Peyton, I…
- Don’t.

531
00:38:59,741 --> 00:39:03,330
It was stupid. Okay? You’re with Brooke now.

532
00:39:05,660 --> 00:39:06,485
Yeah.

533
00:39:06,596 --> 00:39:10,712
We just got carried away. It didn’t mean anything.

534
00:39:13,642 --> 00:39:14,554
It didn’t?

535
00:39:17,438 --> 00:39:18,496
Of course it did.

536
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:56,109
See you later.

537
00:40:37,270 --> 00:40:38,103
It’s okay.

538
00:40:41,290 --> 00:40:42,593
Hey you.
