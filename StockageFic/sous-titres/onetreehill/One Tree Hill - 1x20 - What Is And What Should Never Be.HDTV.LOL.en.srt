1
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:19,222
I had the weirdest dream,

2
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:22,837
that there was this rapping at my window at 4 o’clock in the morning

3
00:01:22,863 --> 00:01:25,628
followed by my boyfriend, who has his own apartment by the way,

4
00:01:25,832 --> 00:01:27,613
asking if he can crash in my room.

5
00:01:28,541 --> 00:01:29,375
Wait a second.

6
00:01:30,595 --> 00:01:31,864
I had to get out of there.

7
00:01:33,534 --> 00:01:37,276
Did I mention this is a recurring dream? This is, what? Like the fourth time in two weeks?

8
00:01:38,443 --> 00:01:41,433
Not that I’m complaining but it does defeat the purpose of having your own place.

9
00:01:41,501 --> 00:01:43,768
Tim keeps bringing over all these hot chicks.

10
00:01:44,428 --> 00:01:47,127
Which is a problem because none of them are you.

11
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:54,220
That place is like party central. It’s not even my party.

12
00:01:54,370 --> 00:01:56,540
Well maybe it should be. Oh we should throw our own party,

13
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:59,330
like a take-back-the-party party.

14
00:01:59,701 --> 00:02:02,820
Alright. Let’s do it. How about this Saturday?

15
00:02:03,162 --> 00:02:04,340
Sounds good! I’m free.

16
00:02:04,586 --> 00:02:07,330
Done. You’ve got to plan it though.

17
00:02:07,382 --> 00:02:10,873
And make sure it’s kind of low-key. Just a few friends, you know.

18
00:02:10,971 --> 00:02:13,153
Okay. So much fun!

19
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:16,465
Now crawl back out the window before my parents wake up and hear you.

20
00:02:16,593 --> 00:02:18,278
Hear what? This?

21
00:02:19,513 --> 00:02:21,944
Oh shoot! Just don’t tickle me!

22
00:02:22,897 --> 00:02:23,674
Hey, Peyton.

23
00:02:24,181 --> 00:02:24,832
What’s up?

24
00:02:25,219 --> 00:02:28,163
Nathan and I are having a little thing at his place on Saturday.

25
00:02:28,236 --> 00:02:29,833
Haley James, party girl.

26
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:32,353
Yeah it’s not going to be that big of a deal but he said that I could invite who ever I want,

27
00:02:32,404 --> 00:02:33,571
- so do you want to come? 
- Hell yeah!

28
00:02:33,638 --> 00:02:34,886
- Alright, I’ll see you there. 
- Later.

29
00:02:39,733 --> 00:02:40,482
Hey, Keith.

30
00:02:41,113 --> 00:02:42,649
That’s Mr. Scott.

31
00:02:43,913 --> 00:02:45,644
What I can’t call you Keith anymore?

32
00:02:46,079 --> 00:02:47,246
No, I’m just trying it out.

33
00:02:47,753 --> 00:02:52,234
What do you think of me as a teacher? High School auto shop.

34
00:02:52,361 --> 00:02:54,798
Well, I think you’d be great. Why?

35
00:02:55,084 --> 00:02:57,799
Because I have an interview tomorrow at a school in Charleston.

36
00:02:59,362 --> 00:03:00,205
Wow.

37
00:03:01,609 --> 00:03:05,033
When you said you planned on leaving, I didn’t realize it would be this fast.

38
00:03:05,171 --> 00:03:08,454
Well, no reason to wait. Right?

39
00:03:11,029 --> 00:03:11,777
Hey, Keith.

40
00:03:12,765 --> 00:03:15,685
Hey, Luke. Tell me you’re going to practice.

41
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,624
Therapist says I’m ready to go.

42
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:19,185
Now that’s what I’m talking about.

43
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:24,038
You didn’t tell him about my proposal, did you?

44
00:03:24,279 --> 00:03:25,945
I was kind of wrestling with that.

45
00:03:29,231 --> 00:03:30,849
Should I tell him you plan on leaving town?

46
00:03:31,673 --> 00:03:33,128
No, I’ll do it.

47
00:03:34,608 --> 00:03:35,746
He’s going to miss you.

48
00:03:37,449 --> 00:03:38,279
Yeah.

49
00:03:46,555 --> 00:03:47,817
Knock it down, Lucas.

50
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:56,152
Keep shooting, man. It will come.

51
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:16,428
See you guys later.

52
00:04:17,708 --> 00:04:19,514
Well, the good news is I’m back.

53
00:04:20,186 --> 00:04:21,937
Bad news is, I suck.

54
00:04:23,945 --> 00:04:26,718
- You okay? 
- Yeah, it’s just a little tight.

55
00:04:27,072 --> 00:04:27,636
Here.

56
00:04:28,782 --> 00:04:32,735
You’re just rusty. Pretty soon you’ll really suck. Just like before.

57
00:04:34,824 --> 00:04:35,637
Better?

58
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:43,631
You know I’d tell you two to get a room, but then you’ve already done that.

59
00:04:49,139 --> 00:04:49,754
Brooke!

60
00:04:51,049 --> 00:04:52,743
Brooke, we got to stop doing this.

61
00:04:52,857 --> 00:04:57,080
Fine, I’ll stop talking to you and you can definitely stop talking to me.

62
00:04:57,147 --> 00:04:57,787
Okay.

63
00:05:00,665 --> 00:05:02,879
I mean we’re not really friends anymore, are we?

64
00:05:03,511 --> 00:05:05,841
You know, for a fake blonde you catch on slow.

65
00:05:06,845 --> 00:05:10,393
Alright, I tried apologizing to you and I’m done trying now.

66
00:05:10,736 --> 00:05:13,762
Good. I mean it’s really pretty pathetic.

67
00:05:15,151 --> 00:05:18,570
Fine, if that’s what you want. Fine.

68
00:05:31,531 --> 00:05:32,666
- Hey. 
- Hey.

69
00:05:33,889 --> 00:05:34,994
I got everything but the drinks.

70
00:05:36,357 --> 00:05:41,195
Make it BYOB. Or BYOT. Get it? Tim? “T”.

71
00:05:43,738 --> 00:05:46,126
You know, if you need some cash I’ve got some from selling the car.

72
00:05:46,213 --> 00:05:49,320
No, this party’s totally on me. But listen, I ran into some extra people

73
00:05:49,372 --> 00:05:52,392
and I didn’t want to say no. But it’s going to be low-key, I promise.

74
00:05:52,736 --> 00:05:53,918
- Okay. 
- Okay.

75
00:05:59,341 --> 00:06:00,012
What?

76
00:06:00,641 --> 00:06:02,033
You’re just lucky Tim’s here.

77
00:06:02,382 --> 00:06:04,701
Cause I’ve got a thing for girls named Haley James.

78
00:06:05,342 --> 00:06:08,137
Really? Well you’re lucky Tim’s here too.

79
00:06:09,873 --> 00:06:11,695
- Tim, go home. 
- Tim, go home.

80
00:06:11,802 --> 00:06:12,704
What?

81
00:06:13,682 --> 00:06:17,557
Um, I’ve got more stuff in the car, so go play. I’ll kiss you later.

82
00:06:17,644 --> 00:06:18,305
Alright.

83
00:06:25,337 --> 00:06:27,276
Damn, she sure was a surprise.

84
00:06:28,075 --> 00:06:33,440
It’s like everything you touch turns cool. You’re like King Midol, or something.

85
00:06:33,523 --> 00:06:34,849
Were you playing this whole time!

86
00:06:34,935 --> 00:06:36,327
Yeah. Your team sucks.

87
00:06:41,541 --> 00:06:42,497
Hey, Mr. Scott.

88
00:06:46,411 --> 00:06:47,822
I win. See ya.

89
00:06:51,485 --> 00:06:52,841
How’s my wife?

90
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:58,355
You want to tell me why some guy I’ve never seen before

91
00:06:58,416 --> 00:07:00,663
came in to put a security system in a new mustang?

92
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:03,024
A mustang I thought I had given to you as a gift!

93
00:07:03,378 --> 00:07:04,467
Cause I sold it.

94
00:07:04,785 --> 00:07:05,820
You had no right to do that.

95
00:07:05,911 --> 00:07:08,677
Dad look, I’ve got expenses now. Like rent.

96
00:07:08,763 --> 00:07:11,692
Uh uh, no, you don’t get that as an out. I’m offering you a home.

97
00:07:11,743 --> 00:07:13,207
You turn me down, you’re on your own.

98
00:07:13,443 --> 00:07:16,633
I want the rest of the money from the sale. I’ll take cash or a check.

99
00:07:16,904 --> 00:07:20,053
Or you can keep the money, and come home with me now.

100
00:07:29,608 --> 00:07:30,836
Thanks  for stopping by, Dad.

101
00:07:32,879 --> 00:07:34,292
We should do this more often.

102
00:07:45,214 --> 00:07:47,640
We’re just trying to keep it small, so don’t advertise.

103
00:07:47,692 --> 00:07:51,090
Oh hey, our lips are sealed. Thanks for the invite, Haley. You rock.

104
00:07:51,175 --> 00:07:51,843
Sure.

105
00:07:53,335 --> 00:07:54,162
Hi, friend.

106
00:07:54,578 --> 00:07:56,666
- Hey, Brooke. 
- So when’s the party?

107
00:07:56,831 --> 00:07:59,574
Well, it’s Saturday night, but...

108
00:08:00,117 --> 00:08:02,273
Don’t worry, I’m not going to tip off the paparazzi.

109
00:08:02,335 --> 00:08:06,482
Oh no, I’m not worried, we’re just trying to keep it small. So.

110
00:08:06,933 --> 00:08:08,509
Peyton  said not to invite me.

111
00:08:08,596 --> 00:08:10,557
No, she didn’t. Not exactly.

112
00:08:11,459 --> 00:08:15,590
Alright. You know, have your little party, and play your naked twister, and...

113
00:08:15,657 --> 00:08:17,786
Brooke, it’s really just going to be couple of friends.

114
00:08:18,648 --> 00:08:21,400
Right, but I’m not one of them.

115
00:08:22,328 --> 00:08:23,444
Whatever.

116
00:08:27,982 --> 00:08:29,844
What kind of experience do you have to have to work at a mall?

117
00:08:30,685 --> 00:08:32,179
I don’t know. Some.

118
00:08:33,807 --> 00:08:37,299
Okay, you want a smoothie? On me?

119
00:08:38,098 --> 00:08:40,002
What do you want? A fruit frolic with protein?

120
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:42,076
How about something with cash in it.

121
00:08:44,392 --> 00:08:45,445
Actually.

122
00:08:46,996 --> 00:08:48,087
Food service?

123
00:08:50,493 --> 00:08:51,252
Pen.

124
00:08:55,818 --> 00:08:56,981
Nathan Scott.

125
00:08:58,158 --> 00:08:59,172
Can you start now?

126
00:09:00,923 --> 00:09:01,665
Yeah.

127
00:09:02,367 --> 00:09:03,463
Well, that was easy.

128
00:09:11,732 --> 00:09:14,133
Hey. I got your Blackout CD.

129
00:09:14,752 --> 00:09:15,797
I forgot I had it.

130
00:09:16,247 --> 00:09:17,180
Thank you.

131
00:09:19,995 --> 00:09:21,055
So you smell that?

132
00:09:22,469 --> 00:09:23,180
What?

133
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:25,296
That scent in the air.

134
00:09:25,904 --> 00:09:27,209
I think it’s called guilt.

135
00:09:28,213 --> 00:09:29,416
Brooke and I called it quits today.

136
00:09:29,908 --> 00:09:30,717
That sucks.

137
00:09:30,957 --> 00:09:33,864
Yeah. Usually girls don’t break up,

138
00:09:33,942 --> 00:09:36,431
we kind of just bitch and bicker until we can work it out.

139
00:09:36,992 --> 00:09:38,357
I’m sorry, Peyton.

140
00:09:38,802 --> 00:09:41,095
Yeah, me too. I’m going to miss her.

141
00:09:41,765 --> 00:09:44,422
Anyway I’m glad you came by, I was actually going to call you.

142
00:09:44,571 --> 00:09:45,335
Why, what’s up?

143
00:09:45,641 --> 00:09:48,033
Haley’s party. Are you going?

144
00:09:48,650 --> 00:09:52,050
Yeah. How great is that, huh? I don’t think Haley’s ever thrown a party.

145
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:53,340
Do you want to go together?

146
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:56,210
Not like a date or anything.

147
00:09:56,721 --> 00:09:58,678
Okay, how exactly does that work?

148
00:09:58,876 --> 00:10:02,543
Let’s see, um, we don’t make out. But we don’t argue.

149
00:10:02,631 --> 00:10:04,411
I think we kind of just have fun.

150
00:10:05,928 --> 00:10:10,739
Look we’re friends, okay? And it would really be great if we could just be friends.

151
00:10:11,022 --> 00:10:12,052
What about Brooke?

152
00:10:12,174 --> 00:10:13,725
Hang out with her, date her, whatever.

153
00:10:14,027 --> 00:10:16,147
You know, but you and I shouldn’t have to avoid each other.

154
00:10:19,271 --> 00:10:19,957
Okay.

155
00:10:20,708 --> 00:10:22,326
- Haley’s party. 
- Great.

156
00:10:22,594 --> 00:10:25,205
So, what are you listening to, huh?

157
00:10:25,572 --> 00:10:29,775
Actually, I’m on this big 80’s metal kick. I just picked up this rat album.

158
00:10:30,116 --> 00:10:32,398
It’s outstanding. Check it out.

159
00:10:56,006 --> 00:10:58,745
Excuse me, can I get a napkin, here?

160
00:10:59,068 --> 00:11:01,080
Yeah, just hang on a second.

161
00:11:02,627 --> 00:11:04,593
Here you go, sir, I’m sorry about that.

162
00:11:04,762 --> 00:11:05,468
Thank you.

163
00:11:07,516 --> 00:11:09,595
Customers first, Scott. Pulp.

164
00:11:09,798 --> 00:11:10,460
What?

165
00:11:10,582 --> 00:11:13,174
P.U.L.P. Performance Understanding Leadership People.

166
00:11:13,235 --> 00:11:14,808
Pulp. The Hot and Twisted way.

167
00:11:15,129 --> 00:11:17,709
Isn’t that what they used to call your mom? Hot and Twisted.

168
00:11:18,268 --> 00:11:21,796
You might be a big star at school but here I’m your boss.

169
00:11:22,888 --> 00:11:24,648
Wait, you got to Tree Hill?

170
00:11:24,785 --> 00:11:26,205
I’m in your history class.

171
00:11:27,879 --> 00:11:30,931
Okay here’s some more recent history. Homecoming last year.

172
00:11:30,981 --> 00:11:34,832
You and a few of your Ravens buddies kicked my ass just for fun. Ring a bell?

173
00:11:36,418 --> 00:11:37,336
Kind of.

174
00:11:39,521 --> 00:11:40,265
Sorry.

175
00:11:54,532 --> 00:11:55,650
Who’s the tie for?

176
00:11:55,993 --> 00:11:58,860
It’s for Keith. He’s got a job interview coming up.

177
00:12:01,377 --> 00:12:03,054
He’s thinking of moving, Luke.

178
00:12:05,053 --> 00:12:05,998
Why?

179
00:12:06,797 --> 00:12:08,046
He can’t get a job here?

180
00:12:09,912 --> 00:12:12,741
I don’t think he wants a job here.

181
00:12:17,927 --> 00:12:18,758
Mom.

182
00:12:20,831 --> 00:12:23,038
Keith proposed to me and I said no.

183
00:12:30,181 --> 00:12:31,343
I got to go see him.

184
00:12:39,165 --> 00:12:40,390
Hey, Luke, what’s up?

185
00:12:41,004 --> 00:12:41,706
Keith.

186
00:12:44,485 --> 00:12:45,541
I’m sorry, man.

187
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:47,291
That’s okay.

188
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:49,999
Mom told me what happened.

189
00:12:51,291 --> 00:12:52,305
Said you're leaving.

190
00:12:53,503 --> 00:12:54,694
We’ll see.

191
00:12:55,402 --> 00:12:56,544
Why didn’t you tell me?

192
00:12:56,964 --> 00:13:00,916
Well as hard as it was that your mom turned me down,

193
00:13:01,715 --> 00:13:03,460
the thought of leaving you is even harder.

194
00:13:04,582 --> 00:13:07,173
I don’t want to be the second Scott brother to do this to you.

195
00:13:07,506 --> 00:13:09,477
Yeah but you know that I don’t see you that way.

196
00:13:11,023 --> 00:13:13,393
Look, I know that Mom said no.

197
00:13:14,357 --> 00:13:16,092
But does that mean that you have to go?

198
00:13:16,917 --> 00:13:18,580
It’s time for me to move on, Luke.

199
00:13:19,928 --> 00:13:23,167
It’s just something I’ve got to do. Whether I get this job or not.

200
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:28,733
But  look, where ever I end up, you can always call or visit.

201
00:13:30,114 --> 00:13:32,276
I’ll always be a guy you can turn to.

202
00:13:34,498 --> 00:13:35,363
I know.

203
00:13:37,524 --> 00:13:39,814
And I want you to have what you want, you know?

204
00:13:42,378 --> 00:13:46,525
But, I wanted you to be my dad, too.

205
00:13:58,718 --> 00:14:01,051
They were so much simpler then.

206
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:04,702
You nostalgic for sleepless nights?

207
00:14:04,763 --> 00:14:09,976
Well let’s see, my husband won’t divorce me, but my son didn’t have to think twice about it.

208
00:14:10,456 --> 00:14:12,167
Oh, Deb, I’m sorry.

209
00:14:14,417 --> 00:14:19,114
You know, I was sitting alone in that big empty house

210
00:14:19,897 --> 00:14:24,531
and it occurred to me, that on my long list of dumb decisions,

211
00:14:25,674 --> 00:14:29,068
turning down your partnership offers was one of the dumbest.

212
00:14:31,152 --> 00:14:32,714
Any chance it still stands?

213
00:14:32,954 --> 00:14:34,408
Of course it does.

214
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:37,670
Good. Then let’s do it.

215
00:14:37,721 --> 00:14:38,505
Alright.

216
00:14:39,222 --> 00:14:44,060
Well, I’m off to tell Dan that he’s got 24 hours to clear out his things or they go to Good Will.

217
00:14:44,147 --> 00:14:46,030
Or else I could help you burn them.

218
00:14:47,142 --> 00:14:48,698
You look nice.

219
00:14:49,047 --> 00:14:49,768
Thank you.

220
00:14:52,322 --> 00:14:53,045
Bye Deb.

221
00:14:53,962 --> 00:14:54,679
Bye.

222
00:14:58,856 --> 00:15:01,007
I wanted to give this to you before your interview.

223
00:15:01,224 --> 00:15:02,165
Oh thanks.

224
00:15:02,375 --> 00:15:04,457
But employee daycare called.

225
00:15:06,178 --> 00:15:07,685
Oh, that’s great.

226
00:15:08,129 --> 00:15:09,030
It’s for good luck.

227
00:15:09,589 --> 00:15:10,623
I’ll get this off.

228
00:15:11,052 --> 00:15:12,978
I already tied it up for you.

229
00:15:14,007 --> 00:15:16,986
You know, Lucas came by to see me last night.

230
00:15:17,191 --> 00:15:18,790
Yeah, he said he was going to.

231
00:15:19,050 --> 00:15:24,912
It really meant a lot to me. And I think he’s going to be okay.

232
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:30,294
Even if I do get the job, I’m less than three hours away, so he can always visit me.

233
00:15:30,597 --> 00:15:32,817
Here, let me help you with that collar.

234
00:15:33,242 --> 00:15:35,947
There you go. Aren’t you cute.

235
00:15:48,035 --> 00:15:49,557
There, that’s better.

236
00:15:51,071 --> 00:15:51,731
Perfect.

237
00:15:54,431 --> 00:15:57,057
Well, I guess I should be going.

238
00:15:57,333 --> 00:15:58,577
You’re going to do great.

239
00:15:59,561 --> 00:16:00,379
Thanks again.

240
00:16:03,248 --> 00:16:04,030
Good luck.

241
00:16:04,726 --> 00:16:05,416
Bye.

242
00:16:06,283 --> 00:16:08,807
Hey. So how goes day two?

243
00:16:09,067 --> 00:16:11,813
Well, I’m mopping, Hales. And I look cool doing it.

244
00:16:12,170 --> 00:16:12,896
I’m sure you do.

245
00:16:13,036 --> 00:16:15,738
I said no cell phones, you’ve got customers, Scott.

246
00:16:17,009 --> 00:16:19,350
Alright, I got to go. Duty calls.

247
00:16:19,738 --> 00:16:20,952
Did you clean the blenders yet?

248
00:16:21,162 --> 00:16:21,940
No, but...

249
00:16:22,114 --> 00:16:23,957
I told you to do that half an hour ago.

250
00:16:24,096 --> 00:16:25,109
Okay relax.

251
00:16:25,273 --> 00:16:28,621
I can’t relax. Unlike you, I actually need this job.

252
00:16:29,907 --> 00:16:30,727
What does that mean?

253
00:16:32,338 --> 00:16:35,528
It means some of us don’t have a rich daddy waiting for them when things get tough.

254
00:16:35,590 --> 00:16:37,938
You know, if I want to go to college I’m going to have to pay for it,

255
00:16:38,011 --> 00:16:41,089
so if you’re just going to waste my time you might as well quit now.

256
00:16:41,299 --> 00:16:42,312
That’s not what I’m doing.

257
00:16:42,389 --> 00:16:45,472
Good. Cause Jerry called in sick. I’m going to need you to cover till 10 o’clock

258
00:16:45,527 --> 00:16:47,903
- then we clean up and do inventory. 
- Look, I have plans tonight,

259
00:16:47,954 --> 00:16:49,828
Alright, then you’re fired. Take your pick.

260
00:16:53,044 --> 00:16:57,540
Well, selling the shop really couldn’t be avoided.

261
00:16:58,041 --> 00:17:01,329
I’m curious why you quit so soon after they hired you on.

262
00:17:02,947 --> 00:17:07,083
Well, the new management was taking things in a different direction.

263
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:08,722
And you had a problem with that?

264
00:17:08,912 --> 00:17:12,700
The new management was my brother. And he’s an ass.

265
00:17:14,579 --> 00:17:15,353
I see.

266
00:17:16,422 --> 00:17:20,364
Mr. Scott, you may be qualified from a technical standpoint,

267
00:17:20,492 --> 00:17:23,007
but teaching teenagers is a whole other thing.

268
00:17:24,409 --> 00:17:25,664
Why do you want this job?

269
00:17:26,646 --> 00:17:30,847
To me, it’s not about teaching them to change a spark plug.

270
00:17:31,233 --> 00:17:36,765
It’s about giving them the confidence to do something that maybe they think they couldn’t do before.

271
00:17:36,893 --> 00:17:40,671
And once you do that, you’ve earned their trust.

272
00:17:41,116 --> 00:17:44,485
And when you have that, you can really have an effect.

273
00:17:48,648 --> 00:17:50,041
My brother’s an ass too.

274
00:18:04,647 --> 00:18:05,984
Somebody’s early.

275
00:18:13,554 --> 00:18:17,812
Hi, you know, Nathan’s not even back from work yet so if you want to come back later.

276
00:18:17,955 --> 00:18:20,494
Somebody’s got to kick this mother off.

277
00:18:22,161 --> 00:18:23,213
What up, Nose?

278
00:18:24,259 --> 00:18:25,057
It’s mouth.

279
00:18:29,409 --> 00:18:32,097
Wow. You’re kind of hot.

280
00:18:33,044 --> 00:18:33,786
Yeah?

281
00:18:35,287 --> 00:18:39,588
So look, I know we’re just hanging out, but I got you a gift.

282
00:18:39,818 --> 00:18:41,032
Dude, you shouldn’t have.

283
00:18:41,144 --> 00:18:42,204
I know, but I did.

284
00:18:42,388 --> 00:18:45,275
Alright, well good. Give it to me, I love gifts.

285
00:18:45,552 --> 00:18:47,549
Well I know how you’re into this whole 80’s metal thing.

286
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:51,419
So I got you the first test of the record.

287
00:18:51,615 --> 00:18:53,888
Oh! This is sweet.

288
00:18:54,517 --> 00:19:00,257
Um, I got you a high five. Do you want it now or later?

289
00:19:00,308 --> 00:19:01,378
- Now is good. 
- Okay.

290
00:19:04,386 --> 00:19:06,247
No one’s coming, I’m sure of it.

291
00:19:07,056 --> 00:19:09,047
Most people don’t want to be first at a party.

292
00:19:13,631 --> 00:19:14,818
Nathan’s late too.

293
00:19:15,653 --> 00:19:16,692
Oh finally!

294
00:19:19,646 --> 00:19:22,611
What’s up! Party in the House.

295
00:19:24,173 --> 00:19:24,977
Um, Tim?

296
00:19:27,907 --> 00:19:29,200
Do you know any of these people?

297
00:19:29,969 --> 00:19:33,690
Not really, but it’s a party, Haley. You wanted people to show up, right?

298
00:19:34,238 --> 00:19:37,734
Yeah, sure. Yeah, cool.

299
00:19:37,829 --> 00:19:39,047
Cool, okay.

300
00:19:59,408 --> 00:20:00,356
Buy  you a drink?

301
00:20:02,461 --> 00:20:05,230
Okay, guy in need of a clue. Here’s one.

302
00:20:05,390 --> 00:20:08,103
Women send signals. That was a brush off.

303
00:20:08,271 --> 00:20:13,012
Before you dip into your shallow pool of wit let me paint us a picture and save us both the trouble.

304
00:20:13,278 --> 00:20:16,674
Here’s your evening. You are going to slink back off to your buddies,

305
00:20:16,747 --> 00:20:20,335
laugh this off, get wasted, go home, and make nice with yourself.

306
00:20:20,385 --> 00:20:24,860
But don’t be thinking of me, because even your fantasy of me, isn’t interested in you.

307
00:20:31,178 --> 00:20:34,728
Nice work. Extra points for style.

308
00:20:35,536 --> 00:20:37,554
I’ve seen you around. You’re Jake’s ex, right?

309
00:20:37,957 --> 00:20:40,650
No, he’s mine. You go to Tree Hill?

310
00:20:44,521 --> 00:20:47,491
So what brings you out into the big, bad, real world?

311
00:20:47,572 --> 00:20:50,113
Anger, alcohol and a fake ID.

312
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:51,413
Nice combo. Men?

313
00:20:51,629 --> 00:20:54,037
Dogs. Two of them.

314
00:20:54,311 --> 00:20:57,952
Ex boyfriend and backstabbing ex girly best friend.

315
00:20:58,034 --> 00:21:02,960
Typical. If you have a strand of hair and five minutes I can show you a great curse you can put on them.

316
00:21:03,048 --> 00:21:03,977
Okay.

317
00:21:06,190 --> 00:21:07,486
Bring it on, witch.

318
00:21:09,222 --> 00:21:11,085
Okay. What are their names?

319
00:21:11,407 --> 00:21:13,788
Lucas, and Peyton.

320
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:18,647
And where are they tonight?

321
00:21:18,786 --> 00:21:22,974
They are at a party that I was not invited to. Can you believe that?

322
00:21:23,107 --> 00:21:27,598
They sneak around like little mongrels and I get removed from the A list.

323
00:21:27,958 --> 00:21:29,154
Can I get you ladies anything?

324
00:21:29,379 --> 00:21:33,214
Yeah, two vodkas. And two for my new friend here.

325
00:21:36,372 --> 00:21:37,828
Now you’re talking, witchiepoo.

326
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:49,091
Nice move, all-star.

327
00:21:55,804 --> 00:21:56,940
You know, it’s a shame.

328
00:21:57,626 --> 00:22:00,995
I have pictures of you in your first bath, your first hair cut.

329
00:22:01,932 --> 00:22:05,127
The first time you walked. Here it is, your first job, and me without a camera.

330
00:22:05,557 --> 00:22:08,193
Of course if I did have a picture of you mom would most likely take it in the divorce.

331
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:09,787
But that probably sounds bitter.

332
00:22:09,955 --> 00:22:12,049
Dad, I’m trying to work here, okay?

333
00:22:12,208 --> 00:22:14,538
I can see that. But come on, Nate.

334
00:22:14,753 --> 00:22:17,191
How long are you going to keep this job? A month? A week?

335
00:22:17,819 --> 00:22:19,607
Come home with me, this is embarrassing.

336
00:22:19,837 --> 00:22:22,827
No, dad, watching you and mom fight is embarrassing.

337
00:22:23,499 --> 00:22:26,422
This might be the ground floor but at least I’m doing it on my own.

338
00:22:27,339 --> 00:22:28,449
Unlike some.

339
00:22:28,815 --> 00:22:29,877
Meaning what?

340
00:22:30,462 --> 00:22:32,575
I could just live off mom's money like you did.

341
00:22:34,650 --> 00:22:37,977
Okay. Alright you’ve got a lot to learn, kid but go ahead.

342
00:22:38,332 --> 00:22:39,728
Impress me.

343
00:22:43,819 --> 00:22:44,373
Dad.

344
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:46,620
Have a pretzel.

345
00:22:48,725 --> 00:22:49,661
It’s on me.

346
00:23:04,863 --> 00:23:08,595
Nathan Scott and your own apartment. You have, like, the best life ever.

347
00:23:09,466 --> 00:23:12,717
Well, thanks, I mean it’s not my apartment, but...

348
00:23:14,029 --> 00:23:14,622
Hi!

349
00:23:15,667 --> 00:23:18,370
- Haley, who are all these people? 
- Who cares? It’s a party.

350
00:23:19,286 --> 00:23:20,213
Sorry I’m late.

351
00:23:21,841 --> 00:23:24,089
Hope nobody minds, but I brought a friend.

352
00:23:25,374 --> 00:23:26,741
Let the games begin.

353
00:23:42,684 --> 00:23:44,430
Maybe if we just invited her.

354
00:23:44,995 --> 00:23:46,559
It’s not your fault, Hales.

355
00:23:48,649 --> 00:23:50,231
Who is this Nikki person anyway?

356
00:23:50,294 --> 00:23:54,286
It’s Jake’s baby’s mom. Yeah. She’s a train wreck.

357
00:23:58,482 --> 00:23:59,734
That did not sound good.

358
00:24:01,590 --> 00:24:03,503
Excuse me. Coming through. Excuse me.

359
00:24:09,671 --> 00:24:11,961
I like a guy who can keep a secret.

360
00:24:13,650 --> 00:24:14,946
You asked me not to say anything.

361
00:24:16,062 --> 00:24:18,183
- So where’s Jake? 
- Working tonight.

362
00:24:18,692 --> 00:24:23,343
Really? Then we’ll just have to have all fun.

363
00:24:25,518 --> 00:24:27,695
Know if they have a carousel in this place?

364
00:24:27,874 --> 00:24:33,501
Look, Nikki, you asked me to do you a favor, and I did it. Okay?

365
00:24:33,828 --> 00:24:37,587
I didn’t tell Jake what happened. Now it’s your turn to do me a favor, okay?

366
00:24:37,643 --> 00:24:41,108
Take Brooke and get her out of here before she starts something. Alright?

367
00:24:41,154 --> 00:24:42,937
My friend, Haley, she doesn’t need this tonight, alright?

368
00:24:43,090 --> 00:24:45,815
Need what? Just having a little fun.

369
00:24:49,823 --> 00:24:51,354
I thought I smelled something.

370
00:24:52,246 --> 00:24:56,683
Oh that’s skank. And I think it’s coming from you.

371
00:24:58,820 --> 00:24:59,684
Come on, Lucas.

372
00:25:04,544 --> 00:25:05,746
Please.

373
00:25:14,381 --> 00:25:16,084
You don’t remember it, do you?

374
00:25:17,386 --> 00:25:18,230
Homecoming.

375
00:25:18,993 --> 00:25:21,303
I remember it. I told you I’m sorry.

376
00:25:22,793 --> 00:25:24,677
What do you need this job so bad for anyway?

377
00:25:26,407 --> 00:25:27,655
You saw my dad, right?

378
00:25:29,074 --> 00:25:33,932
If I can't show a judge that I can support myself, I’ve got to live with that guy.

379
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:37,358
Wow, then you better hope that I don’t fire you.

380
00:25:40,728 --> 00:25:42,131
Alright, here’s the deal, man.

381
00:25:42,952 --> 00:25:47,307
I’m going to work hard because I need this job. Not because you’re gunning for me.

382
00:25:48,218 --> 00:25:50,676
So you can either let it go and accept my apology,

383
00:25:51,327 --> 00:25:53,072
or you can just fire me right now.

384
00:25:56,605 --> 00:25:59,206
Alright, I’ll let it go, but you’ve got to do better, man.

385
00:25:59,472 --> 00:26:02,498
I will. Pulp, all the way, man.

386
00:26:06,461 --> 00:26:10,244
Okay, you can take off. You’re having a party tonight, right?

387
00:26:11,058 --> 00:26:12,887
Well everyone at school knows about it.

388
00:26:14,412 --> 00:26:16,624
- You can stop by if you want. 
- Right, right.

389
00:26:16,695 --> 00:26:19,435
Pry your lips off my ass and get out of here. I’ll see you tomorrow.

390
00:26:21,606 --> 00:26:22,502
Thanks, Gary.

391
00:26:24,165 --> 00:26:25,021
Whatever.

392
00:26:31,452 --> 00:26:32,603
It’s not gonna fill itself.

393
00:26:39,409 --> 00:26:40,699
So, you’re hanging out with Nikki.

394
00:26:41,165 --> 00:26:42,204
Sorry, do I know you?

395
00:26:42,665 --> 00:26:44,785
Look, Brooke, just don’t cause any trouble tonight, okay?

396
00:26:45,762 --> 00:26:49,361
Wait a minute, you’re that tallish lying person I used to be friends with.

397
00:26:49,612 --> 00:26:52,537
Why don’t you go crawling back to the boyfriend formally known as mine.

398
00:26:52,736 --> 00:26:57,517
Okay, this whole not being friends with you thing, is getting so much easier every time I see you.

399
00:27:13,529 --> 00:27:16,738
Hey, you’ve reached Haley James, congratulations.

400
00:27:25,366 --> 00:27:26,253
You’re late.

401
00:27:27,717 --> 00:27:29,125
Are you going to divide those up too?

402
00:27:29,673 --> 00:27:31,653
And deprive you of your glory days?

403
00:27:32,836 --> 00:27:34,132
Wouldn’t think of it.

404
00:27:35,670 --> 00:27:38,022
Oh, may I? Or should I pour half back?

405
00:27:39,486 --> 00:27:41,028
Why are we going through this charade, Deb?

406
00:27:41,796 --> 00:27:43,706
You’re just going to have to unpack that stuff later.

407
00:27:44,290 --> 00:27:46,164
Time to move out of denial, Dan.

408
00:27:46,758 --> 00:27:47,741
Me in denial?

409
00:27:48,437 --> 00:27:51,955
You’re the one sitting here creating busy work for yourself while our son gets a job at the mall.

410
00:27:52,052 --> 00:27:54,519
A direct result of your irrational need to rip the three of us apart.

411
00:27:54,952 --> 00:27:57,213
I ripped us apart?

412
00:27:58,482 --> 00:28:02,011
You know, Dan if I wasn’t half drunk I’d tell you to go screw yourself.

413
00:28:03,015 --> 00:28:03,812
Here they are.

414
00:28:05,362 --> 00:28:06,675
Your trophies.

415
00:28:10,781 --> 00:28:12,164
Congratulations.

416
00:28:14,011 --> 00:28:17,350
So this is what we’ve come to. Huh?

417
00:28:17,417 --> 00:28:19,981
Boxing up our lives, trading insults, drinking cheap wine.

418
00:28:20,039 --> 00:28:21,773
Oh no, the wine’s not cheap.

419
00:28:25,332 --> 00:28:26,551
This is our wedding crystal.

420
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:29,285
No that’s yours. I broke mine.

421
00:28:31,590 --> 00:28:34,968
I don’t want to do this, Deb. I don’t want to divide up our lives.

422
00:28:35,045 --> 00:28:38,906
Dan you already did. You divided this family a long time ago.

423
00:28:39,055 --> 00:28:42,342
How? What did I do? What? By working hard? By building up the business?

424
00:28:42,458 --> 00:28:44,937
Giving you a nice life, a car in the driveway, clothes on your back.

425
00:28:45,025 --> 00:28:48,271
You know what, Dan? You know, keep it all. Here.

426
00:28:50,354 --> 00:28:51,189
You want the car?

427
00:28:53,165 --> 00:28:54,293
Here. Keep the keys.

428
00:28:54,922 --> 00:28:57,538
- You want the house? Take the house. 
- Deb, stop.

429
00:28:57,660 --> 00:29:00,651
Here you want the clothes off my back? Here, take the clothes off my back.

430
00:29:00,708 --> 00:29:04,228
Deb, stop. Will you stop!?

431
00:29:04,291 --> 00:29:07,717
What? What else do you want, Dan?

432
00:29:08,218 --> 00:29:10,902
You. I want you.

433
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:13,527
Don’t say that.

434
00:29:24,087 --> 00:29:26,763
Be careful, please. Be careful. Mouth.

435
00:29:27,298 --> 00:29:31,032
- Little help. 
- I cannot stop the madness.

436
00:29:32,116 --> 00:29:34,551
Okay, you know what? Drink this, you look like you could use it.

437
00:29:37,367 --> 00:29:38,299
Wow!

438
00:29:39,809 --> 00:29:44,156
So you two are playing games. Watch out for them, they look like they might cheat.

439
00:29:44,323 --> 00:29:47,798
Oh you’re still here. I thought that you’d be running off to tuck in my kid.

440
00:29:48,001 --> 00:29:49,287
Someone’s got to.

441
00:29:49,410 --> 00:29:51,995
Yeah well hopefully it’s not some slutty boyfriend thief.

442
00:29:52,721 --> 00:29:53,683
I’ll drink to that.

443
00:29:53,914 --> 00:29:56,342
Look, why don’t you do what you’re really good at and disappear.

444
00:29:56,833 --> 00:29:57,674
You have a problem?

445
00:29:58,097 --> 00:30:00,396
- Wow, Nikki, she’s not worth it. 
- Get off me.

446
00:30:01,710 --> 00:30:05,170
- I asked you if you had a problem. 
- Yeah, I do. It’s called you, bitch.

447
00:30:25,639 --> 00:30:26,991
Haley, help me out here.

448
00:30:30,904 --> 00:30:33,772
Come on! Stop!

449
00:30:46,207 --> 00:30:49,124
- What the hell are you doing? 
- Isn’t this what you wanted?

450
00:30:51,178 --> 00:30:53,288
Stop! You need to go!

451
00:30:54,511 --> 00:30:55,887
Well isn’t this sweet?

452
00:30:56,318 --> 00:30:59,067
Lucas Scott coming to the defense of his women.

453
00:30:59,498 --> 00:31:03,743
Oh, but wait. Shouldn’t that include someone else?

454
00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:09,789
Don’t worry, I can keep a secret too.

455
00:31:18,356 --> 00:31:19,461
You sure you’re okay?

456
00:31:19,589 --> 00:31:22,123
What did she mean by that? Someone else?

457
00:31:30,054 --> 00:31:31,959
She’s the girl I met in the bar.

458
00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:36,992
Lucas Scott betrayal train, all aboard.

459
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:40,612
Move.

460
00:31:41,607 --> 00:31:43,239
And you called me easy.

461
00:31:48,794 --> 00:31:51,830
- Haley? What? 
- Nathan! Oh my gosh, I’m so sorry.

462
00:31:51,923 --> 00:31:53,073
Whose apartment is this?

463
00:31:53,908 --> 00:31:57,083
It’s not going to be that hard to figure out so why don’t you just save us some time.

464
00:31:57,211 --> 00:31:58,266
Alright, it’s mine.

465
00:32:00,139 --> 00:32:03,652
Everyone else, get out of here before we start checking ID’s.

466
00:32:06,151 --> 00:32:09,059
- Wait, what are you doing? 
- Writing you a citation.

467
00:32:09,157 --> 00:32:10,625
Me? I didn’t do anything!

468
00:32:10,825 --> 00:32:13,682
Underage drinking. Disturbing the peace.

469
00:32:13,759 --> 00:32:16,436
Look, sir, he had nothing to do with this. He just got here.

470
00:32:16,545 --> 00:32:19,371
It’s his apartment, it’s his responsibility.

471
00:32:19,931 --> 00:32:22,606
Great, I’m impressed. You learn that in detective school?

472
00:32:23,176 --> 00:32:27,767
So, you want to smart off. Fine.

473
00:32:28,219 --> 00:32:30,235
- You can do that from a cell. 
- Come on!

474
00:32:30,287 --> 00:32:33,574
You want to join him? I didn’t think so.

475
00:32:34,066 --> 00:32:35,095
Come on, let’s go.

476
00:32:44,246 --> 00:32:47,194
Do you remember Christmas break, first semester?

477
00:32:49,888 --> 00:32:54,710
Yeah, we stayed on campus because I was afraid to tell my parents I was pregnant.

478
00:32:54,879 --> 00:32:59,539
We were in that dorm room for days. Everyone was gone. It was quiet.

479
00:33:00,716 --> 00:33:03,875
I remember thinking that maybe the world wasn’t out there anymore.

480
00:33:04,612 --> 00:33:06,502
Maybe it’s just the two of us.

481
00:33:07,413 --> 00:33:09,726
And all the trouble outside has just gone away.

482
00:33:14,017 --> 00:33:14,642
Great.

483
00:33:20,454 --> 00:33:21,180
Yeah?

484
00:33:21,492 --> 00:33:23,832
- Mr. Scott, this is the sheriffs department. 
- What?

485
00:33:24,048 --> 00:33:26,321
- You’re son’s been arrested. 
- Where?

486
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:27,559
He's down at the station.

487
00:33:28,523 --> 00:33:29,224
Okay.

488
00:33:31,347 --> 00:33:32,312
Who was that?

489
00:33:32,737 --> 00:33:36,285
That was the real world. It’s still out there. I got to go.

490
00:33:40,404 --> 00:33:44,170
Bang up job, Nathan. Every time I blink you seem to sink to a new low.

491
00:33:44,482 --> 00:33:46,018
Part of me thinks I should have left you in there.

492
00:33:46,091 --> 00:33:47,114
Maybe you should have.

493
00:33:47,247 --> 00:33:49,771
This experiment of yours is over. You’re coming home.

494
00:33:50,252 --> 00:33:51,102
Forget it!

495
00:33:51,778 --> 00:33:53,121
- Now! 
- No way.

496
00:33:53,278 --> 00:33:55,557
Hey, I brought you into this world, I promise I can take you out.

497
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:56,505
Let him go.

498
00:33:58,280 --> 00:34:01,127
And the disappointments just keep on coming. You stay out of this.

499
00:34:01,287 --> 00:34:04,650
Haley, go get an officer.

500
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:08,746
Let me get this straight. Your mom runs off and has a fling,

501
00:34:08,797 --> 00:34:11,818
I get the cops to drop the charges and now I’m the bad guy here?

502
00:34:11,930 --> 00:34:12,565
Dad.

503
00:34:13,436 --> 00:34:17,670
You might want to think before you start trying to make a case for what a great father you’ve been.

504
00:34:18,054 --> 00:34:19,839
What do you know about me being a father?

505
00:34:20,348 --> 00:34:21,362
Exactly.

506
00:34:22,335 --> 00:34:25,080
You know what? Why don’t you shut up and go talk to your mom.

507
00:34:25,301 --> 00:34:28,003
Tell her you want to know what really happened between us back then.

508
00:34:28,290 --> 00:34:32,026
And you. You want to ruin your life, go ahead. I’m done here.

509
00:34:44,459 --> 00:34:49,513
Come on, it’s late. We’ll take you home.

510
00:35:04,827 --> 00:35:06,291
Hey, what are you doing up?

511
00:35:06,529 --> 00:35:08,646
You know I can’t sleep until you’re home.

512
00:35:20,831 --> 00:35:23,382
You know, it meant a lot to Keith that you went to go see him.

513
00:35:26,333 --> 00:35:29,880
- Are we going to talk about that?
- It’s not really my place, is it?

514
00:35:31,977 --> 00:35:36,796
You deserve to be happy, mom. I mean, no body deserves it more.

515
00:35:39,582 --> 00:35:40,871
But so does Keith.

516
00:35:44,159 --> 00:35:46,627
I just thought that you could be happy together.

517
00:35:47,384 --> 00:35:50,138
You know, I love Keith very much.

518
00:35:54,311 --> 00:35:56,226
I’m just not in love with him.

519
00:35:57,819 --> 00:35:58,761
Were you ever?

520
00:35:59,439 --> 00:36:02,249
I guess I never really let my heart completely go there.

521
00:36:02,349 --> 00:36:05,519
In part because he has been a very good friend.

522
00:36:07,126 --> 00:36:10,001
And sometimes romance confuses a friendship.

523
00:36:11,274 --> 00:36:12,058
Yeah.

524
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:18,156
Well I can’t tell you how to feel in your heart.

525
00:36:22,403 --> 00:36:23,993
It just sucks for Keith, that’s all.

526
00:36:27,244 --> 00:36:28,279
Goodnight, mom.

527
00:36:37,064 --> 00:36:38,355
Don’t worry about it.

528
00:36:41,919 --> 00:36:45,066
I never thought this many people would actually show up.

529
00:36:45,850 --> 00:36:46,515
Why?

530
00:36:47,161 --> 00:36:49,589
Because why would they? I mean, it’s just me.

531
00:36:50,701 --> 00:36:52,534
It kind of comes with the territory, you know?

532
00:36:53,284 --> 00:36:54,294
What territory?

533
00:36:54,996 --> 00:36:55,936
Popularity.

534
00:36:57,933 --> 00:36:59,638
This was just your coming out party.

535
00:37:14,639 --> 00:37:16,925
Who knew tutor girl could throw such a rager!

536
00:37:19,163 --> 00:37:19,970
Who knew.

537
00:37:25,579 --> 00:37:27,415
So thanks for sticking up for me.

538
00:37:29,901 --> 00:37:33,851
Nikki was kind of my responsibility, it was probably a mistake to bring her.

539
00:37:34,174 --> 00:37:35,013
You think?

540
00:37:37,118 --> 00:37:40,379
Judgment impaired by rage and cocktails, I admit it.

541
00:37:43,298 --> 00:37:44,797
I’m sorry.

542
00:37:46,796 --> 00:37:47,913
I want to call truce.

543
00:37:49,965 --> 00:37:50,708
A real one.

544
00:37:53,042 --> 00:37:53,918
Friends again?

545
00:37:57,255 --> 00:37:58,710
Just not enemies anymore.

546
00:38:04,629 --> 00:38:06,242
I was thinking about Lucas.

547
00:38:09,406 --> 00:38:13,834
You know, he’s just a guy, he makes mistakes like all the rest of them.

548
00:38:15,099 --> 00:38:15,799
Maybe.

549
00:38:18,007 --> 00:38:21,156
It just feels so much worse when you expect more from somebody.

550
00:38:23,659 --> 00:38:24,889
Yeah, I know.

551
00:38:30,798 --> 00:38:32,683
So that Nikki bitch is crazy.

552
00:38:39,926 --> 00:38:43,188
You think it’s possible you and me will ever get back to the way we were?

553
00:38:45,799 --> 00:38:48,048
It doesn’t feel like it sometimes.

554
00:38:50,733 --> 00:38:51,425
Yeah.

555
00:38:56,992 --> 00:38:58,072
I’m so tired.

556
00:39:00,254 --> 00:39:01,114
Me too.

557
00:39:08,533 --> 00:39:09,085
Hey.

558
00:39:10,052 --> 00:39:11,312
I got the job.

559
00:39:12,326 --> 00:39:15,168
That’s great. I knew you would.

560
00:39:15,244 --> 00:39:17,088
Yeah, I actually think it was the tie.

561
00:39:17,395 --> 00:39:18,925
I’m pretty sure it was you.

562
00:39:19,274 --> 00:39:25,326
Oh man, I’ll tell ya, I have felt for too long like everyone else is out there living their lives

563
00:39:25,367 --> 00:39:29,601
and when they said they wanted me... I felt good.

564
00:39:33,405 --> 00:39:34,537
So when do you start?

565
00:39:35,269 --> 00:39:36,754
A couple of weeks.

566
00:39:37,660 --> 00:39:38,742
Wow, that soon.

567
00:39:40,119 --> 00:39:41,397
Yeah, that soon.

568
00:39:53,254 --> 00:39:54,418
Weird night.

569
00:39:56,154 --> 00:39:57,444
You can say that.

570
00:39:58,591 --> 00:40:01,125
You know, I was thinking this morning that you should have this divorce.

571
00:40:03,791 --> 00:40:06,122
What changed your mind?

572
00:40:06,773 --> 00:40:09,470
I just realized the same thing I realized in the dorm room.

573
00:40:10,336 --> 00:40:12,164
The real world’s always going to be out there.

574
00:40:13,721 --> 00:40:14,852
And there’s no going back.

575
00:40:59,809 --> 00:41:01,849
Welcome to Hot and Twisted, how can I help you?

576
00:41:12,973 --> 00:41:14,082
- Hey. 
- Hey.

577
00:41:16,012 --> 00:41:20,513
Look, I didn’t know about Nikki and Jake until I met her.

578
00:41:21,086 --> 00:41:23,702
So she was just some stranger in a bar you slept with?

579
00:41:25,344 --> 00:41:27,762
Lucas, you don’t need to apologize. Okay?

580
00:41:27,834 --> 00:41:32,304
It’s just that, after all the stuff that you and I had been through,

581
00:41:33,036 --> 00:41:36,953
where my head and my heart were at I couldn’t have gone and just slept with some stranger.

582
00:41:38,783 --> 00:41:41,617
You know when you and I first met? I was with Nathan.

583
00:41:41,908 --> 00:41:46,896
And he was a pretty bad guy, if you remember.

584
00:41:47,331 --> 00:41:48,012
Yeah.

585
00:41:49,036 --> 00:41:50,285
I’m not doing that again.

586
00:41:52,591 --> 00:41:54,550
Who knew that you two would switch places?

587
00:42:06,572 --> 00:42:11,190
