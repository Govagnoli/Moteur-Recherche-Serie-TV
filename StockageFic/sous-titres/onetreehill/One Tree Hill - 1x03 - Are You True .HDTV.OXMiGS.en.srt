1
00:00:00,502 --> 00:00:02,417
Previously on "One Tree Hill…"

2
00:00:02,594 --> 00:00:06,563
Look, I’ve got an opening in my lineup. Varsity. What do you say?

3
00:00:06,609 --> 00:00:08,467
- What do you want?
- What do you want, man?

4
00:00:08,570 --> 00:00:11,100
I mean, other than my girlfriend and my spot in the lineup?

5
00:00:11,166 --> 00:00:12,851
He’s got our last name, dad.

6
00:00:13,036 --> 00:00:15,021
I can’t change the fact this kid exists.

7
00:00:15,155 --> 00:00:19,809
You have no right to think of him-not today, or any other day of his life! How dare you?

8
00:00:19,855 --> 00:00:22,558
You’re a really good guy and I’m glad we’re friends.

9
00:00:22,716 --> 00:00:24,755
You and me, one on one.

10
00:00:24,805 --> 00:00:27,569
- So, what if he wins? What does he get?
- He gets you.

11
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,030
This is for my mom.

12
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:31,310
Luke for the win!

13
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:36,740
I want to draw something that means something to someone, but I can’t.

14
00:00:39,582 --> 00:00:40,980
It’s too important to me.

15
00:00:41,339 --> 00:00:42,941
I can describe Lucas in one word.

16
00:00:43,899 --> 00:00:44,948
Bastard.

17
00:00:47,851 --> 00:00:50,289
He wasn’t swinging at me, dad. He was swinging at you.

18
00:00:50,335 --> 00:00:54,191
I felt like he had a piece of me. I never felt like that on the playground.

19
00:00:54,267 --> 00:00:57,467
Well, I say he’s taken enough from us.

20
00:00:59,831 --> 00:01:02,296
- You’re gonna be okay.
- Yeah, I am.

21
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:11,102
Time out!

22
00:01:11,199 --> 00:01:14,169
Under twenty-five seconds to go, the Ravens trail by two.

23
00:01:14,217 --> 00:01:15,748
We’re running black for Nathan.

24
00:01:16,713 --> 00:01:19,007
If they double you, fight through them

25
00:01:19,555 --> 00:01:23,185
and take your shot when we have five seconds left. Let’s go.

26
00:01:23,728 --> 00:01:26,068
Ravens on three. One, two, three, Ravens!

27
00:01:26,497 --> 00:01:31,270
So, a quick time out and the Ravens take to the court, their undefeated record at stake,

28
00:01:31,327 --> 00:01:36,052
18 seconds left on the clock. They need a basket to tie, or a 3-pointer for the win.

29
00:01:36,128 --> 00:01:40,214
Jagielski to the inbound finds Guy Smith out top. We’re under 10 seconds now.

30
00:01:40,245 --> 00:01:42,764
Smith dumps it down to Nathan Scott, and he’s double teamed,

31
00:01:42,994 --> 00:01:46,183
but he forces up a 7-footer. It kicks off the heel of the rim.

32
00:01:46,219 --> 00:01:50,736
Jake Jagielski, though with an offensive rebound, with under 5 seconds on the clock,

33
00:01:50,835 --> 00:01:54,935
Jagielski out to Lucas Scott, he is behind the 3-point line.

34
00:01:55,133 --> 00:01:58,011
The Ravens are going to win or lose it right here.

35
00:02:05,947 --> 00:02:10,868
Unbelievable! Lucas Scott with the 3-pointer at the buzzer,

36
00:02:10,924 --> 00:02:15,272
and the Tree Hill Ravens are still undefeated!

37
00:02:15,302 --> 00:02:18,599
And I tell you what, if you’re going to play the Ravens this season,

38
00:02:18,647 --> 00:02:23,238
you better take note, there is a new Scott in town!

39
00:02:26,258 --> 00:02:27,160
Nice game, Lucas.

40
00:02:27,773 --> 00:02:28,665
Thanks.

41
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:33,744
- You rock.
- Thanks, Uncle Keith.

42
00:02:36,896 --> 00:02:39,925
For a kid that was about to quit, that was something to see.

43
00:02:40,202 --> 00:02:42,678
But I picked up fouls too early, and I was slow getting back into it.

44
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:43,791
You were great.

45
00:02:44,637 --> 00:02:46,929
- Thanks guys. See you soon, mom. 
- Not too late.

46
00:02:47,031 --> 00:02:48,188
You did good, Luke.

47
00:02:51,711 --> 00:02:54,404
- You did pretty good, too.
- I can breathe now.

48
00:02:55,327 --> 00:03:00,129
Karen, hi! Keith, hi. I guess congratulations are in order.

49
00:03:00,179 --> 00:03:01,214
Thank you, Shari.

50
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,272
I don’t want to keep you, I just want to let you know

51
00:03:03,308 --> 00:03:07,516
that as the mother of a varsity player, you’re eligible to join boosters.

52
00:03:07,833 --> 00:03:10,895
So, I mean, not that you need to, it’s not required or anything.

53
00:03:11,038 --> 00:03:13,830
And I know you’re really busy with that little café of yours.

54
00:03:13,906 --> 00:03:16,047
Right. When do you meet?

55
00:03:16,124 --> 00:03:19,323
Well, it varies, really. Usually Wednesdays.

56
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,724
- At?
- Uh, Six-ish.

57
00:03:22,098 --> 00:03:27,029
So, it’s really good to see you, honey. Go Ravens!

58
00:03:43,295 --> 00:03:44,630
I thought this was your team.

59
00:03:56,624 --> 00:03:57,626
Hey, you.

60
00:03:58,195 --> 00:04:01,783
Oh, I think you got the wrong car.

61
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:05,506
Nah. Don’t mind me. I just have to get out of this uniform.

62
00:04:06,181 --> 00:04:09,223
So, anyway, I’m Brooke.

63
00:04:09,838 --> 00:04:11,763
But you probably knew that.

64
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:14,912
Can I tell you that that last shot was awesome?

65
00:04:15,608 --> 00:04:18,122
How’d it feel? Good, huh?

66
00:04:19,176 --> 00:04:20,441
You know it did.

67
00:04:23,425 --> 00:04:24,773
Oh, my gosh!

68
00:04:29,996 --> 00:04:31,814
That game wasn’t horrible.

69
00:04:33,252 --> 00:04:36,150
- Thanks, coach.
- Well, don’t turn pro yet.

70
00:04:36,749 --> 00:04:42,135
You drag your scrawny butt to the weight room twice a day starting now.

71
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:44,542
You got it.

72
00:04:44,648 --> 00:04:51,100
Oh… by the way, there’s a half naked girl in the back seat of your car.

73
00:04:51,142 --> 00:04:52,882
I just thought you’d like to know.

74
00:04:58,710 --> 00:04:59,487
Grouchy.

75
00:05:02,658 --> 00:05:05,943
So, anyway… You’re in it now, aren’t you?

76
00:05:06,917 --> 00:05:09,384
When that last shot when through, did you feel it change?

77
00:05:09,866 --> 00:05:11,208
Feel what change?

78
00:05:11,944 --> 00:05:13,071
Everything.

79
00:05:14,022 --> 00:05:16,829
I mean, how many moments in life can you point to and say,

80
00:05:17,162 --> 00:05:18,775
"That’s when it all changed?"

81
00:05:21,243 --> 00:05:22,430
You just had one.

82
00:05:24,841 --> 00:05:28,795
But don’t worry, baby. The popularity thing’s not so bad.

83
00:06:12,761 --> 00:06:17,148
Unbelievable. The guy scores 12 measly points and they act like he’s Iverson.

84
00:06:17,752 --> 00:06:20,102
You know how many games I’ve scored more than that in?

85
00:06:20,457 --> 00:06:23,543
All but two. One of them, I had mono.

86
00:06:24,281 --> 00:06:26,565
Well, you don’t have mono now, do you?

87
00:06:27,716 --> 00:06:30,210
- Care to prove it?
- My dad’s gonna hammer me.

88
00:06:35,289 --> 00:06:38,431
- Something’s changed.
- With your dad?

89
00:06:38,882 --> 00:06:41,826
No, with your room. Something’s different.

90
00:06:42,384 --> 00:06:46,169
It’s my walls. I took my sketches down.

91
00:06:48,972 --> 00:06:50,515
What sketches?

92
00:07:13,842 --> 00:07:17,499
12 points, 8 assists. And I made the game winning shot.

93
00:07:17,729 --> 00:07:18,563
Good!

94
00:07:20,227 --> 00:07:22,874
- That is great, right?
- Yeah, it’s all right.

95
00:07:22,946 --> 00:07:25,701
I can’t believe I had to work! Tell me about it.

96
00:07:25,911 --> 00:07:29,033
Actually, the beginning wasn’t so great, I ran into you-know-who.

97
00:07:29,085 --> 00:07:31,001
Dan? Oh, I’m sorry. Do you want to talk about it?

98
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:34,149
Actually, I wasn’t thinking about checking out the burning boat.

99
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:37,205
- You want to come?
- Well, I suppose I could be seen with you.

100
00:07:37,241 --> 00:07:39,351
Let  me just call home and tell them not to wait up.

101
00:07:44,747 --> 00:07:46,324
Hey, mom, it’s Haley.

102
00:07:46,555 --> 00:07:48,419
Haley James, your daughter.

103
00:07:49,530 --> 00:07:53,073
Listen, I’m gonna go out after work, and I’ll be home. Okay?

104
00:07:53,846 --> 00:07:54,941
All right, bye.

105
00:07:55,443 --> 00:07:58,367
- Was your mom drinking?
- No! I got the machine.

106
00:08:01,582 --> 00:08:03,564
"You don’t have to join the boosters."

107
00:08:03,743 --> 00:08:06,599
And did you get that dig about my "little café"?

108
00:08:06,979 --> 00:08:10,001
What do you care? It’s not like your going to join the boosters, anyway.

109
00:08:10,072 --> 00:08:11,607
That’s not the point.

110
00:08:11,924 --> 00:08:14,792
And  that thing about cheerleading? It’s like they’re still in high school.

111
00:08:14,982 --> 00:08:16,932
I mean, really, let it go.

112
00:08:17,434 --> 00:08:20,183
Well, that’s good advice. Maybe you should take it.

113
00:08:20,726 --> 00:08:22,062
What’s that supposed to mean?

114
00:08:22,252 --> 00:08:26,082
Well, if I’m not mistaken, you still own your cheerleading sweater.

115
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:29,439
All I’m saying is memory lane is a two-way street.

116
00:08:29,511 --> 00:08:33,336
Yeah? So is "You don’t know what the hell you’re talking about" boulevard.

117
00:08:35,558 --> 00:08:37,740
This is not about high school for me, Keith.

118
00:08:38,146 --> 00:08:40,863
- Trust me. 
- Whatever you say.

119
00:08:51,318 --> 00:08:53,039
Hey, it’s Peyton. You know what to do.

120
00:08:55,219 --> 00:08:59,107
Hey, this message is for Peyton. It’s Jeff Nelson calling from THUD magazine.

121
00:08:59,162 --> 00:09:03,171
Your friend dropped off your sketches and, he was right, they’re terrific.

122
00:09:03,268 --> 00:09:05,890
Give me a call when you get a chance. We’d love to talk to you about,

123
00:09:05,941 --> 00:09:08,082
you know, maybe doing a comic strip for the magazine.

124
00:09:08,132 --> 00:09:09,766
Nice work, Peyton. Nice work.

125
00:09:11,526 --> 00:09:13,186
Message deleted.

126
00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:23,855
Come one, come all, to the Tree Hill annual Burning Boat festival.

127
00:09:24,112 --> 00:09:29,519
Burn your bad karma, bad luck, or bad choices and start anew.

128
00:09:29,611 --> 00:09:32,098
We’ll be collecting items all week.

129
00:09:32,208 --> 00:09:36,419
Nothing is too big, too small, too tragic…

130
00:09:36,466 --> 00:09:38,889
- Nice game, Lucas.
- Hey, thanks.

131
00:09:39,452 --> 00:09:44,127
- You are just blowing up.
- Well, yeah, man. I’m a big star now.

132
00:09:44,346 --> 00:09:45,709
You better hope I keep you around.

133
00:09:45,817 --> 00:09:49,125
You know, I’m gonna try not to lose sleep over that, thanks.

134
00:09:50,158 --> 00:09:54,100
So, last night, I’m watching Scandinavian week on the history channel, and I-

135
00:09:54,162 --> 00:09:57,510
- Because…?
- Because… blonde Viking guys are hot.

136
00:09:57,679 --> 00:10:02,201
Anyway, this whole Burning Boat thing is a total rip-off of a Viking funeral.

137
00:10:02,272 --> 00:10:03,132
Did you know that?

138
00:10:03,245 --> 00:10:06,045
- You know, you’re the bomb.
- Thanks.

139
00:10:06,394 --> 00:10:07,310
Check it out.

140
00:10:08,990 --> 00:10:11,857
B+! Brandon, all right! You did it!

141
00:10:11,939 --> 00:10:15,102
Yeah, I just threw all my bad grades into the pot. I’m not going back there.

142
00:10:15,185 --> 00:10:16,322
I know you’re not.

143
00:10:16,455 --> 00:10:19,388
I’ve had I don’t know how many tutors, and this girl’s a miracle worker.

144
00:10:19,450 --> 00:10:22,230
No, this is all you, man. Congratulations!

145
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:24,420
Thanks, Haley. See you.

146
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:26,570
Yes! I knew he could do it! Yes!

147
00:10:26,721 --> 00:10:28,426
- Nice work, Hales.
- Thank you.

148
00:10:29,864 --> 00:10:32,797
So, what bad mojo are you burning this year?

149
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,683
I’m not wearing that on my jersey.

150
00:10:39,116 --> 00:10:42,213
So, we’re going to watch this together, right?

151
00:10:42,761 --> 00:10:45,751
Maybe. I have to check my schedule.

152
00:10:45,875 --> 00:10:48,434
You know, the word around town is that I’m…

153
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:51,200
the bomb. Oh!

154
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:54,523
Wow.

155
00:10:59,474 --> 00:11:00,586
Great game, Lucas.

156
00:11:04,261 --> 00:11:07,487
All right, I’m going to the tutoring center so I can feel superior.

157
00:11:08,639 --> 00:11:11,710
Oh, listen-they’re playing "Attack of the 50-foot Woman" at the Crescent tomorrow.

158
00:11:11,769 --> 00:11:13,389
- Do you want to go?
- Yeah. Count me in.

159
00:11:13,425 --> 00:11:14,732
- All right.
- I’ll call you later.

160
00:11:15,048 --> 00:11:16,671
Hey, who’s that girl he’s always hanging out with?

161
00:11:16,963 --> 00:11:19,293
Who knows? Why? You feel like slumming?

162
00:11:21,895 --> 00:11:24,586
- Who do you think you are?
- Someone you’re pissed at.

163
00:11:24,628 --> 00:11:27,306
- You submitted my sketches to THUD magazine.
- And they liked them, didn’t they?

164
00:11:27,342 --> 00:11:29,411
If I wanted your help, I would ask for it.

165
00:11:29,881 --> 00:11:33,639
Hey, girl. Hey, you didn’t happen to find my...

166
00:11:34,495 --> 00:11:36,411
Thank you, gorgeous.

167
00:11:42,727 --> 00:11:43,901
You’re welcome!

168
00:11:47,863 --> 00:11:49,547
- What you got there?
- What?

169
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:53,091
You know what. The Brooke Davis leopard bra-dude, that thing’s like a welcome mat.

170
00:11:54,109 --> 00:11:58,534
- Anyway, I heard you were naked in his car.
- No. I was partially naked.

171
00:11:58,794 --> 00:12:02,015
At one point I had mittens on ‘cause it was cold. Oh, did you see my-

172
00:12:02,082 --> 00:12:05,711
 Okay, focus. You’re a slut in mittens, you’re in his car. Then what happens?

173
00:12:06,101 --> 00:12:09,786
Well, then nothing. He was really sweet.

174
00:12:09,942 --> 00:12:14,390
He drove me home, said "Good night," waited ‘till I got inside.

175
00:12:15,132 --> 00:12:18,849
- Maybe he’s gay.
- No, I think he’s just nice.

176
00:12:20,068 --> 00:12:22,684
Anyway, it’s gonna be so great when he sleeps with me!

177
00:13:09,159 --> 00:13:12,078
I was just getting used to low-waist jeans.

178
00:13:17,125 --> 00:13:18,898
Lets go, ball boy.

179
00:13:22,624 --> 00:13:23,777
How’s things been since the game?

180
00:13:25,210 --> 00:13:26,194
Different.

181
00:13:26,732 --> 00:13:30,209
People I’ve never talked to say "Hello" to me like they’ve always known me

182
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:32,419
and the teachers smile more.

183
00:13:33,158 --> 00:13:36,332
- Cheerleaders strip in your car.
- Sounds like the good life.

184
00:13:36,504 --> 00:13:39,433
- Yeah, it sounds like it, but not really.
- No?

185
00:13:39,531 --> 00:13:41,492
No, the team’s hazing me a little bit.

186
00:13:41,958 --> 00:13:45,757
Well, believe it or not, I wouldn’t take it too personally.

187
00:13:46,386 --> 00:13:49,269
See, we did that when I played.

188
00:13:50,268 --> 00:13:52,552
Unless it gets completely out of hand, just roll with it.

189
00:13:53,484 --> 00:13:54,646
Show ‘em what you’re made of.

190
00:14:03,258 --> 00:14:04,164
Nathan!

191
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:13,195
I’m tinkering with the offense. You’ll be playing more small forward.

192
00:14:13,717 --> 00:14:15,740
Forget it. I’m the shooting guard.

193
00:14:16,196 --> 00:14:19,099
That’s funny. I thought I was the coach.

194
00:14:19,371 --> 00:14:24,823
As a matter of fact, you can call me that, and I’ll call you "small forward".

195
00:14:24,992 --> 00:14:30,267
Nathan Scott, small forward. Has a nice ring to it.

196
00:14:43,884 --> 00:14:46,020
I hear Whitey gave your spot to Lucas.

197
00:14:46,751 --> 00:14:48,791
Do you even care that it’s slipping away?

198
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:56,747
All the work we’ve put into it, all the plans that we’ve made.

199
00:14:58,174 --> 00:15:00,193
All the plans you’ve made, dad.

200
00:15:00,714 --> 00:15:02,204
All  the work I’ve done.

201
00:15:02,727 --> 00:15:05,553
Fine, quit the team.

202
00:15:06,019 --> 00:15:08,313
Hell, quit school for that matter. I’ll tell you what;

203
00:15:08,354 --> 00:15:10,827
I’ll give you a job working at the dealership. You can spend the rest of your life

204
00:15:10,883 --> 00:15:14,067
haggling over free floor mats with morons with bad credit. How does that sound?

205
00:15:14,129 --> 00:15:17,057
Because that’s where you’re headed, and that’s if I give you the job!

206
00:15:22,516 --> 00:15:24,538
I just want more for you, Nathan.

207
00:15:25,337 --> 00:15:28,517
More than a 9-5 and the feeling you could’ve had a better life.

208
00:15:31,747 --> 00:15:33,350
And, I want you to be happy.

209
00:15:34,306 --> 00:15:35,269
I do.

210
00:15:36,566 --> 00:15:39,541
But, you need to tell me if you still want to do this.

211
00:15:41,275 --> 00:15:42,176
Do you?

212
00:15:44,803 --> 00:15:45,719
Okay.

213
00:15:48,198 --> 00:15:49,897
But, happiness doesn’t come cheap.

214
00:15:51,756 --> 00:15:53,942
Hell, if it did, we’d all be smiling.

215
00:16:00,972 --> 00:16:05,135
Didn't I tell you that was gonna happend? Whitey’s using you to get back at me,

216
00:16:06,165 --> 00:16:09,165
and I apologize, Nathan, because it’s not your fault.

217
00:16:09,517 --> 00:16:11,827
What do you want me to do, dad? It’s Whitey’s team.

218
00:16:11,965 --> 00:16:12,955
No, it’s not.

219
00:16:13,632 --> 00:16:16,799
Whitey didn’t understand when I was playing for him. He doesn’t get it now.

220
00:16:17,248 --> 00:16:19,225
This is your team. Not his.

221
00:16:20,705 --> 00:16:22,247
What position do you want to play?

222
00:16:22,395 --> 00:16:24,757
- I think I’m stronger at shooting guard.
- I agree.

223
00:16:25,308 --> 00:16:28,128
So, if this new kid’s taken your position, he’s no longer your teammate, is he?

224
00:16:28,185 --> 00:16:31,416
He’s your opponent. And how do we defeat an opponent?

225
00:16:34,222 --> 00:16:37,315
Identify his weaknesses and attack them.

226
00:16:38,753 --> 00:16:41,621
Look, you guys are the ones I feel sorry for.

227
00:16:41,974 --> 00:16:43,746
Me? I’m going to get my minutes.

228
00:16:43,816 --> 00:16:46,813
But you guys have been busting your tails since the junior leagues.

229
00:16:47,371 --> 00:16:50,658
Now you finally get your shot and Whitey gives the starting spot to this guy?

230
00:16:51,370 --> 00:16:55,885
It’s not right. If you ask me, he shouldn’t even be on the team.

231
00:16:55,962 --> 00:16:58,661
- So then, what are we going to do?
- We’re gonna make him earn it.

232
00:16:59,167 --> 00:17:01,062
At least make him suffer like we did.

233
00:17:14,798 --> 00:17:16,304
It’s only going to get worse, man.

234
00:17:22,448 --> 00:17:26,164
So, the hazing begins… right on schedule.

235
00:17:27,952 --> 00:17:29,800
Can you smell the desperation?

236
00:17:33,999 --> 00:17:35,919
We all went through it. Hang in there.

237
00:17:39,318 --> 00:17:41,526
So, what happens if we haze this guy and he doesn’t go away?

238
00:17:41,683 --> 00:17:43,260
With what I’ve got planned, he will.

239
00:17:43,415 --> 00:17:47,167
- But, what if he doesn’t?
- If he doesn’t, I’ve got a backup plan.

240
00:17:53,077 --> 00:17:53,839
Hey.

241
00:17:54,939 --> 00:17:57,863
- Can I help you?
- I hope so. You’re my tutor.

242
00:17:58,273 --> 00:18:02,645
- Right. I don’t think so.
- You’re Haley James, right?

243
00:18:06,704 --> 00:18:09,185
I’m sorry. I’m best friends with Lucas.

244
00:18:09,501 --> 00:18:11,523
Well, then I’m sorry, too.

245
00:18:12,123 --> 00:18:14,507
- Forget it. I’ll find you someone else.
- Whoa, look.

246
00:18:14,603 --> 00:18:17,672
There is nobody else. All right? I’d be fine with it if there was.

247
00:18:17,713 --> 00:18:20,795
- If there were.
- See? You’re helping me already.

248
00:18:20,893 --> 00:18:25,189
Look, I can’t help you and on top of that, I won’t help you. Okay?

249
00:18:36,018 --> 00:18:36,796
Interesting.

250
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:39,233
Where have you studied?

251
00:18:40,625 --> 00:18:41,983
Mostly in my bedroom.

252
00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:43,748
Is that a bad thing?

253
00:18:44,343 --> 00:18:48,628
No, just surprising for someone with your talent.

254
00:18:50,692 --> 00:18:51,992
Well, your stuff is great.

255
00:18:53,446 --> 00:18:55,335
I do have a few concerns, though.

256
00:18:56,083 --> 00:19:00,011
You’re younger than I expected, and we have firm deadlines to make a press run.

257
00:19:00,061 --> 00:19:02,386
Give me a deadline. I’ll meet it.

258
00:19:03,933 --> 00:19:07,487
All right, then how about a test strip?

259
00:19:08,311 --> 00:19:11,854
Use your high school characters, but, give them a twist.

260
00:19:12,299 --> 00:19:13,138
A twist?

261
00:19:14,049 --> 00:19:17,368
The way you portray high school, the girls are so tragic.

262
00:19:17,492 --> 00:19:21,290
Don’t get me wrong, I like it. But, the magazine wants wish fulfillment.

263
00:19:21,347 --> 00:19:25,918
- You know, pretty, popular, like a…
- A cheerleader?

264
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:30,090
Perfect. Cheerleaders are always happy.

265
00:19:32,912 --> 00:19:37,069
Identity-this was a common theme in the work of E.E. Cumings.

266
00:19:37,899 --> 00:19:39,735
While it’s true he was most known as a…

267
00:19:39,778 --> 00:19:42,205
Lucas, what’s your favorite color?

268
00:19:42,651 --> 00:19:43,496
Black.

269
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:46,721
B-l-a-c-k.

270
00:19:46,895 --> 00:19:48,748
When Cummings died in 1962, he was enormously popular,

271
00:19:49,691 --> 00:19:51,355
especially with young readers.

272
00:19:52,163 --> 00:19:53,347
What’s your favorite number?

273
00:19:57,084 --> 00:20:00,920
Okay, what’s your favorite sexual position?

274
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:05,844
I’ll use mine.

275
00:20:12,756 --> 00:20:14,379
So, you like me.

276
00:20:14,677 --> 00:20:19,622
Mostly because he dealt with sex… and war.

277
00:20:20,544 --> 00:20:23,847
Okay, folks, listen up-I want everyone to bring in something by Cummings-

278
00:20:23,909 --> 00:20:27,665
poem, essay, whatever-to the next class. Okay, thank you for your work.

279
00:20:34,651 --> 00:20:37,284
Hey. I just wanted to let you know that I’m gonna be fine.

280
00:20:38,012 --> 00:20:38,911
Good.

281
00:20:40,569 --> 00:20:42,306
I mean, F is for fine, right?

282
00:20:49,939 --> 00:20:51,719
You know she’ll never go for it.

283
00:20:52,892 --> 00:20:54,685
So, how’s your Lucas quest going?

284
00:20:55,150 --> 00:20:57,563
Fine. Ow! Hand.

285
00:20:59,661 --> 00:21:03,840
Let me ask you something. Why are you being so persistent with this one?

286
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:06,256
You normally would have moved on by now.

287
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:09,323
- Why? Are you jealous?
- No.

288
00:21:09,998 --> 00:21:12,789
- Do you like him?
- No.

289
00:21:13,204 --> 00:21:17,085
See, there’s this guy named Nathan, who’s also called my boyfriend.

290
00:21:17,178 --> 00:21:19,496
Yeah-ow! Ooh. Well...

291
00:21:20,772 --> 00:21:25,569
maybe I want a boyfriend, too-someone reliable for once, steady…

292
00:21:27,161 --> 00:21:30,731
Without all the drama, anger, and pettiness you and Nathan have.

293
00:21:36,362 --> 00:21:37,079
Ow!

294
00:21:38,779 --> 00:21:41,456
- Isn’t Haley working today?
- She’s making a delivery.

295
00:21:42,162 --> 00:21:43,576
Doesn’t that girl ever go home?

296
00:21:44,417 --> 00:21:46,562
Haley comes from a big family.

297
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:51,056
When Lucas met her, I think they were eight or nine.

298
00:21:52,224 --> 00:21:54,953
But she saw it was just me and Lucas, and she said

299
00:21:55,014 --> 00:21:58,040
"Yeah, I come from a big family. I think you guys need me more."

300
00:21:59,162 --> 00:22:01,511
Did  he tell you about his troubles with the team?

301
00:22:01,901 --> 00:22:05,751
Yeah. I told him not to take it so personally.

302
00:22:06,888 --> 00:22:09,836
Speaking of taking things personally, I was thinking about my brush

303
00:22:09,868 --> 00:22:13,406
with Shari and the boosters. I think I may have overreacted.

304
00:22:14,162 --> 00:22:15,976
I think I know how you can find out.

305
00:22:18,730 --> 00:22:23,205
Okay, the last item on the agenda is fundraising.

306
00:22:23,471 --> 00:22:27,399
So, we will have our booth at Burning Boat and...

307
00:22:28,008 --> 00:22:32,021
- Karen, hi.
- You start at six, right?

308
00:22:33,446 --> 00:22:37,695
No, sweetie, we start at five sharp. You must have misunderstood me.

309
00:22:37,792 --> 00:22:38,673
Sure.

310
00:22:39,128 --> 00:22:42,911
Everybody, this is Karen, Lucas Scott’s mother.

311
00:22:43,143 --> 00:22:45,001
Oh, so you’re Dan’s ex?

312
00:22:45,165 --> 00:22:48,493
- Actually, we were never married.
- Oh.

313
00:22:50,025 --> 00:22:55,149
I just thought I’d come down here and introduce myself to all of you and say "Hello."

314
00:22:55,292 --> 00:22:58,452
- Is Lucas on the team for good?
- What do you mean?

315
00:22:58,537 --> 00:23:01,585
Well, I mean, it just seems strange that a new boy on the squad

316
00:23:01,647 --> 00:23:05,021
becomes a starter ahead of boys who have been Ravens for years.

317
00:23:06,716 --> 00:23:10,212
Um, now then, as I was saying, um, I think that Burning Boat-

318
00:23:10,285 --> 00:23:14,882
It’s ‘cause he’s good. Coach Durham thinks he deserves to,

319
00:23:14,908 --> 00:23:18,599
and maybe you want to tell your sons that so next time they steal his wallet,

320
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:22,040
or ruin his clothes, or whatever else they have planned for him.

321
00:23:22,101 --> 00:23:24,686
- Excuse me?
- He’s a kid who’s doing his best.

322
00:23:24,763 --> 00:23:29,089
Whoa, whoa. You walk in here-late,

323
00:23:29,204 --> 00:23:33,006
I might add-and start making accusations about our boys?

324
00:23:33,554 --> 00:23:35,854
Our boys are the good ones.

325
00:23:37,052 --> 00:23:40,477
- Exactly what does that mean?
- You know exactly what I mean.

326
00:23:41,512 --> 00:23:44,911
You know, Shari, I came down here wanting to give you the benefit of the doubt,

327
00:23:44,967 --> 00:23:51,178
but clearly you’re still the same petty little bitch you were in high school.

328
00:23:57,189 --> 00:23:58,531
Well, um…

329
00:24:40,452 --> 00:24:43,459
Hey. I heard about this.

330
00:24:44,744 --> 00:24:46,219
I hoped it wasn’t true.

331
00:24:47,238 --> 00:24:48,313
What do you want, Peyton?

332
00:24:48,984 --> 00:24:51,201
I just want to tell you I’m not doing the comic strip.

333
00:24:52,138 --> 00:24:53,510
That’s a mistake.

334
00:24:54,021 --> 00:24:55,409
Yeah, well maybe some people aren’t ready

335
00:24:55,434 --> 00:24:57,851
to expose themselves to the world like you and your basketball.

336
00:24:57,897 --> 00:25:00,605
Maybe you are ready, but you’re just scared.

337
00:25:12,172 --> 00:25:13,642
Well, did you at least meet with them?

338
00:25:13,708 --> 00:25:16,631
Yeah. Yeah, I mean, the editor loved my stuff.

339
00:25:16,677 --> 00:25:19,104
He just wanted me to change it into something totally different.

340
00:25:20,882 --> 00:25:22,719
It’s really not that big of a deal.

341
00:25:23,656 --> 00:25:26,826
Guess I just… I just want to say thanks.

342
00:25:27,670 --> 00:25:30,947
Wow. Did Peyton Sawyer just say "thank you"?

343
00:25:37,004 --> 00:25:39,139
Look, if Nathan did this, I’m sorry.

344
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,515
Why do you stay with him, anyway?

345
00:25:43,696 --> 00:25:45,206
‘Cause sometimes it’s good.

346
00:25:47,111 --> 00:25:48,801
Sometimes there’s no one else.

347
00:25:54,412 --> 00:25:55,191
Hey, Peyton...

348
00:25:57,434 --> 00:25:58,969
that editor is wrong.

349
00:26:09,204 --> 00:26:11,432
- Karen’s Café.
- I’m calling for Haley James.

350
00:26:11,611 --> 00:26:14,160
- Yeah, this is her.
- Hey, it’s Nathan Scott.

351
00:26:16,489 --> 00:26:18,231
I really need your help.

352
00:26:18,625 --> 00:26:19,900
Sorry, this isn’t her.

353
00:26:23,223 --> 00:26:25,363
- What was that?
- Wrong number.

354
00:26:26,279 --> 00:26:28,594
You just said this was her. What, did you forget your own name?

355
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,442
What’s up?

356
00:26:36,013 --> 00:26:42,050
This guy wants me to tutor him, and I said "No" ‘cause he’s kind of a bad guy.

357
00:26:42,214 --> 00:26:42,961
You know him?

358
00:26:43,755 --> 00:26:45,154
Not really. I just know of him.

359
00:26:45,465 --> 00:26:46,189
Dangerous?

360
00:26:46,791 --> 00:26:47,344
No.

361
00:26:50,345 --> 00:26:53,228
- What? You’ve got that look.
- What look?

362
00:26:53,292 --> 00:26:58,066
The look that my mom always gets when she wants to throw her two cents in. What?

363
00:26:58,382 --> 00:27:03,130
Well, Haley, I think you have pretty good instincts so I’m not trying to tell you what to do,

364
00:27:03,369 --> 00:27:07,559
but just to play devil’s advocate, if this boy came for tutoring,

365
00:27:07,614 --> 00:27:09,503
maybe he’s trying to change.

366
00:27:13,529 --> 00:27:16,344
Might be something in there worth saving.

367
00:27:24,494 --> 00:27:26,421
Well, Luke, I owe you an apology.

368
00:27:27,034 --> 00:27:27,879
For what?

369
00:27:28,485 --> 00:27:30,399
I told you not to take things personally,

370
00:27:30,623 --> 00:27:32,226
but they’re making it personal.

371
00:27:33,501 --> 00:27:34,899
All right, let’s give her a try.

372
00:27:39,206 --> 00:27:40,746
Sorry, we’re closed.

373
00:27:46,758 --> 00:27:47,970
Hi, I’m Jake.

374
00:27:48,678 --> 00:27:51,273
- Oh, hi, Jake. I’m Keith.
- How are you doing?

375
00:27:52,195 --> 00:27:54,411
I got some paperwork to do. See you.

376
00:27:57,826 --> 00:28:00,423
- I heard about the court.
- You heard about it, or you were there?

377
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:03,669
Hey, I don’t buy into that mob rule nonsense, all right.

378
00:28:03,730 --> 00:28:05,738
I play defense. I live my life. That’s it.

379
00:28:05,866 --> 00:28:07,233
Yeah, and what about the rest of the team?

380
00:28:07,872 --> 00:28:10,463
Look, Luke, the guys on the team-they’re in a tough spot.

381
00:28:10,708 --> 00:28:13,310
Because of the suspension, most of these guys are younger,

382
00:28:13,454 --> 00:28:15,194
and they’re not going to stand up to Nathan.

383
00:28:15,798 --> 00:28:17,939
It’s not right, but that’s the way it is.

384
00:28:18,501 --> 00:28:22,167
Yeah, well, the way it is doesn’t work for me,

385
00:28:22,382 --> 00:28:24,103
and it doesn’t work for my friends.

386
00:28:24,283 --> 00:28:27,282
Yeah, I know. But that’s… that’s kind of why I came here.

387
00:28:29,238 --> 00:28:31,937
This thing could get really messy if someone doesn’t take the high road.

388
00:28:31,982 --> 00:28:37,097
And, I know this is not my place to ask, but I was just hoping that you could rise above it.

389
00:28:37,363 --> 00:28:38,900
I don’t think I can do that.

390
00:28:39,929 --> 00:28:42,698
Okay. Just know that if you do,

391
00:28:44,471 --> 00:28:46,041
the team’s gonna come around.

392
00:28:46,528 --> 00:28:48,603
Their gonna see that you’re a good guy and a hell of a player.

393
00:28:48,735 --> 00:28:49,755
And if I can’t?

394
00:28:50,733 --> 00:28:51,832
Then I got your back.

395
00:28:55,863 --> 00:28:58,561
- They trashed the court?
- Yep.

396
00:28:59,826 --> 00:29:00,742
What else?

397
00:29:01,417 --> 00:29:04,428
Broke into my locker, soaked my stuff.

398
00:29:05,954 --> 00:29:08,299
I don’t know, Hales, I don’t know how much longer I can put up with this.

399
00:29:09,692 --> 00:29:12,857
Do you think they’re gonna, like, let up anytime soon?

400
00:29:13,215 --> 00:29:16,117
- No chance. And you want to know why? 
- Why?

401
00:29:16,148 --> 00:29:18,191
Because Nathan controls the team.

402
00:29:18,825 --> 00:29:20,576
And there’s no way in hell he’s gonna back off.

403
00:29:22,491 --> 00:29:23,429
What are you thinking?

404
00:29:24,048 --> 00:29:29,481
This weird thing happened at the tutoring center. It’s not important, nevermind.

405
00:29:29,860 --> 00:29:31,472
- Are you sure?
- Yeah. Mm-Hmm.

406
00:29:31,734 --> 00:29:33,281
Are we still going to go to the movie tomorrow night?

407
00:29:33,935 --> 00:29:37,151
- Yeah. Sounds like fun. 
- Okay, cool.

408
00:29:41,181 --> 00:29:43,458
Luke, how far do you think he’s really gonna go.

409
00:29:44,063 --> 00:29:46,193
- Nathan?
- I don’t know.

410
00:29:47,104 --> 00:29:49,445
As far as he wants to go until somebody stops him.

411
00:31:06,225 --> 00:31:06,972
Hey, Luke.

412
00:31:08,672 --> 00:31:10,387
Lets go, lets go! Get him in! 

413
00:31:51,102 --> 00:31:54,147
Well, well. The gang’s all here.

414
00:31:55,719 --> 00:31:57,129
I told you it was gonna get worse.

415
00:31:59,083 --> 00:32:02,785
Now, see, normally this is when you become part of the team.

416
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:06,022
We’d have a keg, tell some war stories…

417
00:32:07,275 --> 00:32:09,595
but you had to know that wasn’t going to happen, right?

418
00:32:10,285 --> 00:32:15,196
Look… these guys made a choice to back me.

419
00:32:16,195 --> 00:32:19,077
But we’re going to be nice, and we’re going to let you walk away.

420
00:32:20,363 --> 00:32:21,781
Just quit the team, man.

421
00:32:23,828 --> 00:32:25,297
Otherwise, it’s going to get ugly.

422
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:30,867
- Let’s get out of here.
- Bye, Luke.

423
00:32:42,618 --> 00:32:43,960
Hey, where you been?

424
00:32:44,770 --> 00:32:45,542
Nowhere.

425
00:32:46,284 --> 00:32:49,341
Luke... What happened to you?

426
00:32:49,853 --> 00:32:51,763
I had a little run-in with the team.

427
00:32:53,775 --> 00:32:56,736
Luke, I’m sorry this is so hard for you.

428
00:32:57,518 --> 00:33:00,611
I wish there was a way that I could help, but I don’t think there is.

429
00:33:00,713 --> 00:33:01,639
There’s not.

430
00:33:01,803 --> 00:33:06,785
Well, if it makes you feel any better, I called some woman a bitch the other day.

431
00:33:09,939 --> 00:33:11,961
I’m proud of you. You know that?

432
00:33:12,941 --> 00:33:15,388
Sometimes I wonder where you get all your strength.

433
00:33:15,664 --> 00:33:18,536
- I get that from you. 
- Oh, I don’t know about that.

434
00:33:19,284 --> 00:33:23,742
- I haven’t been on my best behavior lately. 
- Well, they don’t make it easy, do they?

435
00:33:23,994 --> 00:33:29,396
No, they don’t. That doesn’t mean we have to sink to their level.

436
00:33:29,529 --> 00:33:31,229
Take the high road, huh?

437
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:34,612
Yeah, sounds familiar.

438
00:33:36,364 --> 00:33:37,420
But, mom,

439
00:33:38,919 --> 00:33:40,445
I tried that.

440
00:33:41,424 --> 00:33:43,788
And I want to make you proud, I do.

441
00:33:45,565 --> 00:33:49,822
But there comes a certain point when you have to fight back.

442
00:33:53,752 --> 00:33:55,135
And I’m at that point.

443
00:34:06,972 --> 00:34:10,001
Ball! Ball! Ball! Over here! Ball!

444
00:34:16,007 --> 00:34:17,176
What the hell was that?

445
00:34:18,789 --> 00:34:22,942
- Here! Second team!
- But he stole the ball from his own team!

446
00:34:23,024 --> 00:34:27,990
But nothing! That guy has hit seven in a row and you won’t pass him to ball!

447
00:34:28,973 --> 00:34:32,281
And you! This is a team game.

448
00:34:35,547 --> 00:34:38,449
If you guys don’t get your heads out of your asses,

449
00:34:38,993 --> 00:34:43,110
I might be forced to suspend my second team this season.

450
00:34:43,319 --> 00:34:44,303
Go home!

451
00:34:46,873 --> 00:34:48,849
So much for the high road, huh?

452
00:35:06,461 --> 00:35:07,496
Hey!

453
00:35:08,249 --> 00:35:09,031
Hey.

454
00:35:09,724 --> 00:35:12,079
- I tried to call you about last night...
- No, it’s okay.

455
00:35:12,130 --> 00:35:14,950
You’re mom told me what happened. Are you all right? I was really worried about you.

456
00:35:14,998 --> 00:35:17,864
Yeah, I know, and I’m sorry.

457
00:35:18,499 --> 00:35:23,537
- Luke, I just want things to get better for you.
- Trust me, so do I.

458
00:35:25,841 --> 00:35:29,246
- They’re not going to, are they?
- Well, not without a fight.

459
00:35:31,248 --> 00:35:35,574
Hey. I’ll find a way to get past this. Don’t worry about it.

460
00:35:38,032 --> 00:35:41,284
You know what? I need to do something.

461
00:35:43,772 --> 00:35:46,517
I will see you tomorrow for Burning Boat, okay?

462
00:35:46,578 --> 00:35:47,796
- Okay.
- Okay.

463
00:35:49,773 --> 00:35:53,726
Uh, sorry. I’m sorry too.

464
00:35:54,019 --> 00:35:55,011
For what?

465
00:35:57,406 --> 00:35:58,379
I’ll see you tomorrow.

466
00:36:24,641 --> 00:36:26,201
- Hey.
- Hey.

467
00:36:26,761 --> 00:36:30,452
I looked over your English exam, and if you really want to learn, I can help you.

468
00:36:31,718 --> 00:36:33,985
That’s great. All right.

469
00:36:34,374 --> 00:36:39,790
I just… I have two conditions. One, Lucas does not find out, okay? Ever.

470
00:36:39,944 --> 00:36:40,851
All right, fine.

471
00:36:41,987 --> 00:36:45,274
And number two, you leave him alone.

472
00:36:47,318 --> 00:36:49,529
Well, I don’t really have much of a choice, do I?

473
00:36:51,675 --> 00:36:55,417
Okay, meet me tomorrow, 7AM at the Market Street dock.

474
00:36:55,790 --> 00:36:57,952
Well, what about the tutoring center?

475
00:36:58,284 --> 00:37:01,030
No way. The dock. Take it or leave it.

476
00:37:02,206 --> 00:37:04,265
Okay. 7:00 then.

477
00:37:06,734 --> 00:37:07,521
Okay.

478
00:37:19,190 --> 00:37:22,062
- Breakfast of champions. Want some?
- You’re late.

479
00:37:28,693 --> 00:37:30,571
Ugh, please let this be a cheat sheet.

480
00:37:36,757 --> 00:37:37,638
It’s for you.

481
00:37:38,887 --> 00:37:40,236
- Stop it. 
- Come on.

482
00:37:43,899 --> 00:37:45,635
Don’t say I never gave you anything.

483
00:37:48,236 --> 00:37:51,621
Do you see this book? Because this book is me. I am math.

484
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:54,876
- What’s that supposed to mean?
- It’s supposed to mean that you can work

485
00:37:54,923 --> 00:37:58,481
your whole "I’m Nathan Scott, Mr. Big shot, scoring my touchdowns" on somebody else,

486
00:37:58,553 --> 00:38:00,371
- because I don’t...
- I don’t even play football.

487
00:38:00,898 --> 00:38:04,180
Whatever. Look, the point is at the end of the day, all your bluster and BS

488
00:38:04,271 --> 00:38:07,467
don’t mean anything to math because math don’t care, and neither do I.

489
00:38:08,029 --> 00:38:11,779
Well, does English care? ‘Cause I really suck at that, too.

490
00:38:11,983 --> 00:38:13,391
Please don’t waste my time.

491
00:38:14,226 --> 00:38:17,559
I am already taking a huge chance on you because my instincts are screaming that you’re full of sh...

492
00:38:20,095 --> 00:38:22,454
Let’s just get started, okay?

493
00:38:26,269 --> 00:38:27,196
Page 81.

494
00:38:34,148 --> 00:38:34,808
Hey.

495
00:38:35,612 --> 00:38:39,616
This is who I am. This is how I am. And 95% of the time

496
00:38:39,714 --> 00:38:44,818
there isn’t a moral, or a victory, or a silver lining. Take it or leave it.

497
00:38:46,743 --> 00:38:48,049
And if we leave it?

498
00:38:49,084 --> 00:38:51,618
If you leave it then you’ll miss that other 5%.

499
00:38:52,391 --> 00:38:53,810
Your mistake.

500
00:38:58,029 --> 00:38:58,838
Good evening.

501
00:38:59,988 --> 00:39:04,153
Usually the master of ceremonies at this deal is Red Legner.

502
00:39:04,781 --> 00:39:11,283
But, well… Red died, so what are you gonna do?

503
00:39:13,594 --> 00:39:17,663
Now, every year we have a Burning Boat,

504
00:39:17,832 --> 00:39:22,113
and every year people find things to toss into it.

505
00:39:22,855 --> 00:39:26,078
I guess if everything was perfect, we wouldn’t be human.

506
00:39:28,009 --> 00:39:29,972
Time to let the past go.

507
00:39:35,963 --> 00:39:38,383
- Shari!
- Karen.

508
00:39:40,652 --> 00:39:45,747
I just wanted to introduce you to my son, Lucas. Lucas, this is Shari, Tim’s mother.

509
00:39:45,987 --> 00:39:46,941
Stepmother.

510
00:39:48,026 --> 00:39:49,229
Nice to meet you.

511
00:39:51,313 --> 00:39:54,068
- I’m gonna take off, okay?
- Okay.

512
00:39:54,724 --> 00:39:56,531
- You be careful.
- I will.

513
00:39:59,726 --> 00:40:03,032
Look, I’m sorry about what I said before.

514
00:40:04,060 --> 00:40:09,510
Because-let’s face it-it’s been a long time. We really don’t know each other anymore.

515
00:40:10,693 --> 00:40:13,647
But I want to give you the benefit of the doubt so that next time we meet,

516
00:40:14,158 --> 00:40:16,866
at least I’ll be dealing with the person you’ve become.

517
00:40:18,781 --> 00:40:20,799
And I hope you’ll do the same.

518
00:40:22,001 --> 00:40:27,746
I guess it’s not every day that we get a shot at starting over

519
00:40:27,783 --> 00:40:29,948
and putting our feet on the right path.

520
00:40:30,490 --> 00:40:34,435
That said, I guess we better get to the rat killing.

521
00:40:52,391 --> 00:40:53,803
Say "good bye" to cheerleading, mom.

522
00:41:02,262 --> 00:41:03,889
So, you my date tonight, Luke?

523
00:41:05,579 --> 00:41:08,134
You know, Brooke, you don’t have to act like this.

524
00:41:10,043 --> 00:41:12,856
I know that. But you’re the first guy to ever say it.

525
00:41:17,299 --> 00:41:19,915
You do your thing and try to resist.

526
00:41:20,689 --> 00:41:21,946
It’s actually kind of cute.

527
00:41:32,526 --> 00:41:33,777
You left that at the court.

528
00:41:35,511 --> 00:41:37,702
- I don’t know what you’re talking about.
- Then call it a gift.

529
00:41:38,322 --> 00:41:41,441
Besides, you’re gonna need it to paint over your scoring title in the gym,

530
00:41:41,927 --> 00:41:45,070
- 'cause I’m taking it.
- Yeah, in your dreams.

531
00:41:45,183 --> 00:41:46,402
I don’t care what you do to me.

532
00:41:46,842 --> 00:41:49,853
Whatever you got, you better bring it, ‘cause I’m not going anywhere.

533
00:41:53,922 --> 00:41:56,017
Burn these for me, would you?

534
00:41:58,685 --> 00:42:02,673
E.E. Cummings once wrote, "To be nobody but yourself,

535
00:42:03,322 --> 00:42:06,026
in a world which is doing its best, night and day,

536
00:42:06,426 --> 00:42:08,009
to make you everybody else…"

537
00:42:08,423 --> 00:42:09,058
Hey.

538
00:42:09,851 --> 00:42:10,369
Hey.

539
00:42:10,828 --> 00:42:15,018
"…means to fight the hardest battle, which any human being can fight…"

540
00:42:15,212 --> 00:42:16,098
Nice bracelet.

541
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,845
"…and never stop fighting."

542
00:42:31,663 --> 00:42:35,001
Hey, it’s Jeff Nelson. I just wanted to let you know,

543
00:42:35,139 --> 00:42:37,376
we’re running your strip in the next issue.

544
00:42:43,823 --> 00:42:47,413
- Where were you this morning?
- Just tutoring.

545
00:42:47,755 --> 00:42:49,328
Oh, yeah? Anyone I know?

546
00:42:51,130 --> 00:42:52,112
No.

547
00:42:57,385 --> 00:43:04,902
