1
00:00:00,363 --> 00:00:02,078
Previously on One Tree Hill.

2
00:00:02,642 --> 00:00:03,814
What’re you talking about Haley?

3
00:00:04,289 --> 00:00:05,780
We got married last night.

4
00:00:06,789 --> 00:00:09,338
Mom… I want to leave Tree Hill.

5
00:00:09,558 --> 00:00:10,576
This is from Lucas.

6
00:00:10,623 --> 00:00:12,221
I’m sorry; I shouldn’t have hid it from you.

7
00:00:12,287 --> 00:00:14,134
You’ve had the words the whole time and didn’t tell me?

8
00:00:14,201 --> 00:00:15,041
I was going to.

9
00:00:15,165 --> 00:00:17,110
- When?! After you read it first?!
- No!

10
00:00:17,243 --> 00:00:19,884
It’s Dan. He had a heart attack.

11
00:00:20,238 --> 00:00:24,196
Your father is unconscious Nathan and now you’re telling me you got married?

12
00:00:24,273 --> 00:00:27,734
- Mrs Scott, we’ve...
- Shut up, Haley. Shut your selfish little mouth!

13
00:01:30,803 --> 00:01:32,206
T.H. White said;

14
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:36,717
perhaps we all give the best of our hearts uncritically…

15
00:01:38,642 --> 00:01:41,181
to those who hardly think about us in return.

16
00:01:46,558 --> 00:01:49,686
The Phoenix Effect isn’t uncommon in cardiac patients.

17
00:01:49,743 --> 00:01:54,186
They grow… remorseful… introspective, sometimes even joyous.

18
00:01:54,478 --> 00:01:56,823
Really? Is it… permanent?

19
00:01:57,389 --> 00:02:02,368
Time will tell. The important thing is to keep him calm. Don’t upset him.

20
00:02:15,857 --> 00:02:17,544
Three questions. You ready?

21
00:02:18,199 --> 00:02:19,015
Was that your first one?

22
00:02:19,848 --> 00:02:22,843
Number one; what happened to your hair?

23
00:02:26,738 --> 00:02:28,274
I left it in Charleston.

24
00:02:29,662 --> 00:02:30,713
You and Haley still married?

25
00:02:30,845 --> 00:02:32,556
Yeah, she hasn’t thrown me out yet.

26
00:02:33,861 --> 00:02:34,604
Number two;

27
00:02:36,114 --> 00:02:37,174
why’d you come back?

28
00:02:37,794 --> 00:02:38,803
It was the right thing to do.

29
00:02:40,454 --> 00:02:43,118
Which actually brings me to my number two; how’s your…

30
00:02:45,156 --> 00:02:46,029
how’s Dan doing?

31
00:02:46,569 --> 00:02:51,965
Oh, he’s alright. He’s still alive, probably freaking out about me and Haley; like my mom.

32
00:02:53,104 --> 00:02:54,551
Alright, last question;

33
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:57,720
you regret all that ‘you’re my brother’ stuff, now that you’re back?

34
00:02:58,238 --> 00:03:00,440
- Absolutely. You?
- Definitely.

35
00:03:03,313 --> 00:03:05,473
So I can totally see your family tripping out.

36
00:03:06,082 --> 00:03:08,689
I mean I freaked out and I’m not even related to Haley.

37
00:03:09,165 --> 00:03:11,540
Actually, you are now.

38
00:03:16,132 --> 00:03:17,361
She’s gotta be pregnant.

39
00:03:18,191 --> 00:03:19,425
Or in love.

40
00:03:19,778 --> 00:03:23,884
I’m going with pregnant. Please, he’s a Scott boy, just look at one and snap your…

41
00:03:25,584 --> 00:03:27,079
never mind, um…

42
00:03:28,252 --> 00:03:29,950
what’s new in your musical world right now?

43
00:03:30,956 --> 00:03:31,820
I dunno.

44
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:37,248
The new Keane’s pretty good or Modest Mouse, Pilot to Gunners.

45
00:03:37,372 --> 00:03:38,309
Keane…

46
00:03:39,224 --> 00:03:42,388
- Mighty Mouse…
- It’s Modest. Why are you typing those?

47
00:03:42,592 --> 00:03:47,088
I’m putting them on your turn-ons. I’m adding you to Lust Factor dot com.

48
00:03:47,175 --> 00:03:47,754
Brooke!

49
00:03:48,089 --> 00:03:51,696
Oops! Too late. We can check your scores in a couple of hours.

50
00:03:51,758 --> 00:03:54,180
I told you; I am not about chasing guys right now.

51
00:03:54,385 --> 00:03:56,228
Doesn’t mean I can’t chase them for you

52
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:58,501
and missy, if you’re not about chasing guys…

53
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:02,797
why are there half a dozen e-mails to Jake Jagielski in your sent mail folder?

54
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:06,550
He hasn’t answered any of them and I swear I am changing all of my passwords.

55
00:04:09,001 --> 00:04:13,278
Okay, I don’t know, alright? But ever since he-who-can’t-be-named,

56
00:04:13,375 --> 00:04:16,288
I just feel like I need to shake things up and not guys,

57
00:04:16,376 --> 00:04:19,114
okay, like… life, important stuff.

58
00:04:19,305 --> 00:04:20,993
Guys are important.

59
00:04:21,699 --> 00:04:25,285
And speaking of the nameless one; he’s waiting so we should get going.

60
00:04:25,935 --> 00:04:27,327
What do you think he wants?

61
00:04:28,054 --> 00:04:30,563
If he’s smart… forgiveness.

62
00:04:38,424 --> 00:04:39,477
What do you think?

63
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:44,777
I was thinking; bar right over there, then some lights…

64
00:04:45,713 --> 00:04:47,674
DJ, right over here…

65
00:04:50,337 --> 00:04:53,742
and then... the three of us trying to be friends…

66
00:04:54,334 --> 00:04:56,373
right about... well, there.

67
00:04:56,697 --> 00:05:00,091
Okay, totally confused over… here.

68
00:05:00,372 --> 00:05:03,342
I wanna throw a party for Nathan and Haley, okay?

69
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:06,900
You know, everyone’s been so… weirded out about them getting married

70
00:05:06,972 --> 00:05:11,989
and nobody’s stepping up and just saying ‘hey, it’s cool! Let’s celebrate.’

71
00:05:12,721 --> 00:05:15,517
We’re their friends… we should do this for them.

72
00:05:16,178 --> 00:05:20,535
And since nobody plans a party better than you and nobody rocks a party better than you…

73
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:25,029
I was hoping the three of us could work it out.

74
00:05:25,102 --> 00:05:26,710
The party part or the friends part?

75
00:05:26,939 --> 00:05:27,697
All of it.

76
00:05:30,853 --> 00:05:32,254
Look, I guess you found the letter.

77
00:05:36,229 --> 00:05:37,625
I should get something to drink.

78
00:05:38,757 --> 00:05:40,405
Look! I meant what I said.

79
00:05:41,645 --> 00:05:45,218
Okay, and now that I’m back, it’s a little embarrassing

80
00:05:46,529 --> 00:05:48,274
- so how about we just...
- Don’t mention it!

81
00:05:48,612 --> 00:05:49,330
Great.

82
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:54,009
So what do you say huh? You in?

83
00:05:54,122 --> 00:05:57,245
- Any excuse for a party.
- For Nathan and Haley, why not.

84
00:05:57,322 --> 00:05:59,663
Great! We’ll do it together.

85
00:06:00,368 --> 00:06:02,181
Come on! Check it out!

86
00:06:03,769 --> 00:06:06,623
Fake cough? That’s the best you could come up with?

87
00:06:06,678 --> 00:06:07,690
I know, I had nothing.

88
00:06:12,811 --> 00:06:14,827
Have you ever seen the sky so blue?

89
00:06:16,538 --> 00:06:19,400
- It’s a nice day.
- They’re all nice.

90
00:06:21,924 --> 00:06:23,034
Dan,

91
00:06:25,784 --> 00:06:28,806
- we should talk about Keith.
- I don’t blame you, Deb.

92
00:06:30,751 --> 00:06:33,250
Lord knows I’ve given you enough reasons to stray.

93
00:06:37,005 --> 00:06:38,933
 I think I’ll get some rest now.

94
00:06:40,069 --> 00:06:43,075
- Okay.
- How about you bring the divorce papers by?

95
00:06:43,151 --> 00:06:46,296
I should sign them. You never know what could happen to me.

96
00:06:46,449 --> 00:06:48,554
Nothing is going to happen to you, Dan.

97
00:06:50,141 --> 00:06:51,445
It already has.

98
00:07:03,498 --> 00:07:05,167
Excellent right back at you BIL.

99
00:07:06,541 --> 00:07:09,806
Okay, I’ve been gone for, what; few days and you already forgotten my name?

100
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:13,458
- Who’s Bill?
- B-I-L; Brother In Law. That’s you!

101
00:07:14,016 --> 00:07:16,151
Oh-ho, crap. I’m related to you?

102
00:07:17,591 --> 00:07:21,368
Look, I know… I was sketchy when I left but…

103
00:07:21,896 --> 00:07:24,572
just, you know, you surprised me and…

104
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:27,435
I just want you to know I’m happy for you, Hales.

105
00:07:28,177 --> 00:07:32,960
I know. And Nathan told me about you calling and asking about Dan and us and…

106
00:07:33,437 --> 00:07:34,475
it’s cool. Thank you.

107
00:07:36,646 --> 00:07:39,272
Hey! Get your own wife.

108
00:07:39,979 --> 00:07:42,222
Okay, that just sounds weird.

109
00:07:45,219 --> 00:07:48,627
Oh, crap. Can you grab that for me real quick?

110
00:07:54,321 --> 00:07:55,181
Thanks.

111
00:07:56,736 --> 00:08:02,492
Oh look, it’s our very own Britney Spears and… whoever she married this week.

112
00:08:02,696 --> 00:08:05,942
I have a question for you guys; what do you think? Pink booties or blue?

113
00:08:06,057 --> 00:08:08,129
Booties? Brooke, I’m not pregnant.

114
00:08:08,218 --> 00:08:11,315
No. The only way this isn’t totally screwed up is if you’re knocked up

115
00:08:11,387 --> 00:08:12,819
but don’t worry, your secret’s safe with me.

116
00:08:13,669 --> 00:08:17,084
What’s this lame-ass joke about you guys getting married?

117
00:08:17,171 --> 00:08:19,513
He’s in shock now that you’re officially off the market.

118
00:08:19,659 --> 00:08:22,031
- It’s true Tim, Haley’s preggers.
- Brooke!

119
00:08:22,133 --> 00:08:24,395
Right; and Lucas moved away.

120
00:08:25,486 --> 00:08:28,123
You guys gotta do better if you gonna get one over on the Tim.

121
00:08:29,685 --> 00:08:30,591
The Tim

122
00:08:44,203 --> 00:08:45,080
Hi.

123
00:08:48,011 --> 00:08:50,094
This is for Mr Scott; Dan.

124
00:08:51,033 --> 00:08:52,028
I don’t know what to call him.

125
00:08:52,435 --> 00:08:53,847
You can take it to him yourself.

126
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:56,446
Nathan said that probably wasn’t a good idea.

127
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,028
And coming over here was?

128
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:04,097
Mrs Scott, I’m not sorry I married Nathan

129
00:09:04,158 --> 00:09:06,800
but I am sorry about how we ambushed you with it.

130
00:09:07,096 --> 00:09:09,129
I know you’re dealing with a lot right now.

131
00:09:12,135 --> 00:09:15,310
Anyway, Lucas is throwing us a party and we’d…

132
00:09:17,081 --> 00:09:19,703
I’d love it if you could come.

133
00:09:20,768 --> 00:09:24,310
Nathan’s father nearly dies and you want to have a party?

134
00:09:24,704 --> 00:09:26,999
And even if Dan were fine,

135
00:09:27,356 --> 00:09:31,626
I would not and will not give you my blessing for destroying my sons life

136
00:09:32,063 --> 00:09:37,213
or, and you can trust me on this, your own.

137
00:09:50,232 --> 00:09:50,935
Hey hoe.

138
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:53,458
Brooke, step away from the computer.

139
00:09:53,582 --> 00:09:57,800
Soon as I check your ‘Lust Factor’ score, this morning you were up to a 7.6.

140
00:09:57,888 --> 00:09:58,819
Out of a 10?

141
00:10:00,773 --> 00:10:03,678
Brooke you did not post my ass on the internet!

142
00:10:03,775 --> 00:10:07,345
Of course I did! And well, well, well, it raised Miss P’s overall

143
00:10:07,437 --> 00:10:11,814
by five tenths on a point and you now have fifty-three guys waiting to meet you.

144
00:10:11,901 --> 00:10:13,059
I can’t believe this.

145
00:10:13,811 --> 00:10:16,617
Too old. Oh, too hairy.

146
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:19,520
Too… mine!

147
00:10:20,405 --> 00:10:23,381
Oh too female, but a 9.8, that’s interesting.

148
00:10:25,311 --> 00:10:29,592
Here we go; here’s an emo looking, sappy, guitar playing loser.

149
00:10:29,664 --> 00:10:31,794
- He’s perfect for you.
- Not interested

150
00:10:32,028 --> 00:10:35,388
and I’ve gotta burn Nathan and Haley’s CD so get up. Move it!

151
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,252
Fine!

152
00:10:42,156 --> 00:10:47,630
So, what do you think our... new pal Lucas wrote in that letter anyway?

153
00:10:47,871 --> 00:10:51,311
Didn’t matter when he was gone, why should it matter now?

154
00:11:02,026 --> 00:11:05,525
You can shave your head dawg, but you still aint as pretty as me.

155
00:11:06,185 --> 00:11:07,331
How you doing Skills?

156
00:11:08,104 --> 00:11:09,637
Question is how you doing man.

157
00:11:10,424 --> 00:11:11,976
I’m good! I’m good.

158
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:13,818
Alright, here it is.

159
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:18,268
How bout you tell me da truth in da next five seconds

160
00:11:18,571 --> 00:11:20,142
and I forget you jus lied to me.

161
00:11:24,086 --> 00:11:26,521
I woke up in Charleston and realised...

162
00:11:27,873 --> 00:11:33,362
nobody knows me here, nobody knows about Dan, my mom,

163
00:11:34,474 --> 00:11:38,498
all the things I regret. It’s all been erased. You know, it’s gone.

164
00:11:41,903 --> 00:11:42,858
And it felt good.

165
00:11:43,746 --> 00:11:46,956
Knowing that whoever I decided to be from that day forward

166
00:11:47,299 --> 00:11:48,852
was the person that they’d see.

167
00:11:51,221 --> 00:11:52,327
Then the phone rang.

168
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:56,244
Well hey, what could I do to make it easier for you?

169
00:11:56,669 --> 00:11:57,980
My bald head brother.

170
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:01,645
Actually,

171
00:12:02,997 --> 00:12:04,936
see if you can get the guys to help me out a little later.

172
00:12:05,165 --> 00:12:06,950
Okay, time and place.

173
00:12:07,194 --> 00:12:09,014
Beautiful, thanks Skills.

174
00:12:09,597 --> 00:12:10,276
No doubt.

175
00:12:12,288 --> 00:12:17,609
Hey yo Luke! You gotta let it flow baby. You know, like me.

176
00:12:17,707 --> 00:12:18,890
Yeah, I know, I know, I know.

177
00:12:19,577 --> 00:12:21,373
As you can see, I’m trying.

178
00:12:22,996 --> 00:12:24,603
Alright. No doubt.

179
00:12:27,962 --> 00:12:30,420
Hey, Nathan. It’s good to see you.

180
00:12:31,665 --> 00:12:33,799
- Haley told me what you said to her.
- Nate!

181
00:12:33,871 --> 00:12:37,456
We’re married now mom, and you and dad can flip out all you want but it’s done!

182
00:12:37,527 --> 00:12:38,872
Nobody cares what you think!

183
00:12:40,394 --> 00:12:42,149
I only want what’s best for you, Nathan.

184
00:12:42,934 --> 00:12:46,789
Then how about you and dad back off… and shut up about Haley and me.

185
00:12:46,866 --> 00:12:48,258
Your father doesn’t even know!

186
00:12:48,792 --> 00:12:50,389
- You haven’t told him?
- No.

187
00:12:50,517 --> 00:12:52,154
You’re such an adult, why don’t you tell him?

188
00:12:53,339 --> 00:12:56,333
The news will probably kill him and believe me,

189
00:12:56,394 --> 00:12:59,492
the guilt from that will stay with you a lot longer than Haley ever will.

190
00:13:02,328 --> 00:13:03,870
Thanks for the love mom.

191
00:13:12,102 --> 00:13:16,701
All these empty bedrooms. We could open a crack house; an upscale one.

192
00:13:17,043 --> 00:13:18,273
Yeah, like a crack resort.

193
00:13:19,188 --> 00:13:21,683
She came back for Mr Waffles.

194
00:13:24,052 --> 00:13:25,870
- Nathan do something?
- No.

195
00:13:26,746 --> 00:13:31,175
- His… mother, she said...
- You were ruining her son’s life.

196
00:13:31,288 --> 00:13:32,526
Yeah, basically.

197
00:13:34,642 --> 00:13:36,213
Of course she did.

198
00:13:38,312 --> 00:13:42,721
In-laws… are like the FBI, honey.

199
00:13:43,688 --> 00:13:49,786
They have a system and they follow it. First manoeuvre is you’re ruining her child’s life.

200
00:13:49,858 --> 00:13:52,633
- Yeah, then it goes to; she can’t cook.
- Her house is dirty.

201
00:13:52,706 --> 00:13:54,317
We found some hash in the guestroom.

202
00:13:56,709 --> 00:13:58,618
There’s only one way to deal with them kiddo.

203
00:13:58,705 --> 00:14:02,387
Screw em. I mean, you know, don’t actually have sex with them.

204
00:14:02,499 --> 00:14:03,309
Dad!

205
00:14:04,403 --> 00:14:07,993
What your father’s saying is, if you’re gonna come home crying

206
00:14:08,064 --> 00:14:10,143
every time you let them get the best of you;

207
00:14:11,029 --> 00:14:14,782
you might as well move back in now, before we give your stuff to charity.

208
00:14:16,058 --> 00:14:20,180
You wanted this Haley. Time to grow up.

209
00:14:21,945 --> 00:14:25,273
By the way, the dog threw up on Mr Waffles.

210
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:53,245
- Keith.
- Hey.

211
00:14:54,299 --> 00:14:58,314
I meant to call you but… you know, this thing with Dan is…

212
00:15:03,419 --> 00:15:06,572
Anyway... Luke left his IPod in the truck.

213
00:15:08,789 --> 00:15:10,084
Oh, I’m sorry.

214
00:15:11,052 --> 00:15:12,690
In that you had to come back.

215
00:15:14,059 --> 00:15:17,948
But I’ll be honest, I’m relieved that Lucas is home.

216
00:15:18,455 --> 00:15:19,157
Yeah.

217
00:15:19,854 --> 00:15:20,975
And you too.

218
00:15:21,195 --> 00:15:23,529
Well I’m not sure how long I’m gonna stay but...

219
00:15:24,753 --> 00:15:25,813
you know, we’ll see.

220
00:15:27,405 --> 00:15:28,239
I’ll see ya.

221
00:15:43,316 --> 00:15:46,564
- That kid looks kinda like Luke. 
- It can’t be, Luke moved away.

222
00:15:46,662 --> 00:15:48,700
Ah, hey thanks for helping out guys.

223
00:15:49,356 --> 00:15:53,486
So you throwin a party for da devil huh? This part of your fresh start?

224
00:15:53,709 --> 00:15:55,580
You know what, you’re going to be surprised Skills.

225
00:15:56,733 --> 00:16:00,005
- Haley’s turned him into a pretty decent guy.
- Hey if you say so man.

226
00:16:00,163 --> 00:16:03,357
Hey dawg, with dis new look of yours, really don’t impress me.

227
00:16:03,451 --> 00:16:06,902
Now if you get a afro like Fergie, den we can talk.

228
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:19,098
- Woah, Peyton. That looks great.
- Thanks.

229
00:16:19,189 --> 00:16:23,798
Okay, for future reference; having a convertible filled with inflated rubber, not smart!

230
00:16:23,889 --> 00:16:25,369
- Helium condoms?
- What?

231
00:16:25,452 --> 00:16:28,554
If she’s pregnant, it’s a reminder and if she’s not; it’s a reminder it’s cute.

232
00:16:29,046 --> 00:16:31,474
- Hey Mouth, how’s your bod?
- Skinny.

233
00:16:33,290 --> 00:16:34,750
You know Skills and Fergie, right?

234
00:16:34,873 --> 00:16:37,944
Of course I do. Hey guys, do you know Peyton?

235
00:16:38,830 --> 00:16:39,362
Hi.

236
00:16:40,008 --> 00:16:41,103
What’s up skinny girl?

237
00:16:41,969 --> 00:16:44,344
Peyton’s an 8.1 on the ‘Lust Factor’.

238
00:16:45,937 --> 00:16:46,966
Soon to be a 9.

239
00:16:47,678 --> 00:16:50,135
Now I was thinking we can take the cameras, put them out on the tables,

240
00:16:50,222 --> 00:16:51,999
people can take pictures for the wedding wall.

241
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:52,982
Nice.

242
00:16:54,267 --> 00:16:57,043
Care to know what else I have planned? I know you do!

243
00:16:57,641 --> 00:17:02,147
I have spray string; for when Tutor Girl and Boy arrive and…

244
00:17:02,613 --> 00:17:03,575
Mouth, come here.

245
00:17:06,003 --> 00:17:06,688
Sit.

246
00:17:08,076 --> 00:17:09,592
What is that?

247
00:17:09,757 --> 00:17:13,831
This, Missy blond girl, is the Brooke Davis version of  ‘Spin the Bottle’.

248
00:17:14,968 --> 00:17:18,250
Only now, it’s ‘Spin the Body’. Watch.

249
00:17:20,365 --> 00:17:22,250
Okay, you two have to make out.

250
00:17:24,610 --> 00:17:27,292
And last but not least; we have ‘Five Minutes in the Elevator’.

251
00:17:27,434 --> 00:17:30,246
- Isn’t it ‘Five Minutes in the Closet’?
- Yeah, if you’re in junior high.

252
00:17:30,318 --> 00:17:33,651
But the great part about this is; you know how everybody has their elevator list?

253
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:34,434
What?

254
00:17:36,841 --> 00:17:38,914
Your elevator list! Come on!

255
00:17:39,005 --> 00:17:42,540
The list of people you’re allowed to have sex with if you’re ever stuck in an elevator with them.

256
00:17:42,741 --> 00:17:44,439
- Halle Berry.
- Beyonce.

257
00:17:44,531 --> 00:17:46,487
- Jack Black.
- Brooke Davis.

258
00:17:48,126 --> 00:17:52,400
Well! Everybody makes a list and if two people have each others names…

259
00:17:52,585 --> 00:17:54,034
five minutes in the elevator.

260
00:17:55,667 --> 00:17:57,371
Sounds like fun Brooke. Nice work!

261
00:17:57,470 --> 00:18:00,885
Thank you. Now all we need is a Nathan and a Haley.

262
00:18:01,314 --> 00:18:03,771
No. Yes. No. Yes.

263
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:09,716
How you doing dad?

264
00:18:14,878 --> 00:18:17,509
I’m sorry about the play-offs Nathan. All on me.

265
00:18:17,612 --> 00:18:19,255
It’s okay, it’s done.

266
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:24,720
- I know things haven’t been great between us lately...
- Dad, listen, before you say anything...

267
00:18:25,329 --> 00:18:27,069
there’s something you should know.

268
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:29,982
Haley and I…

269
00:18:31,094 --> 00:18:32,138
we got married.

270
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:35,998
Uh, you trying to give me another heart attack, son?

271
00:18:36,167 --> 00:18:37,284
No, it’s true.

272
00:18:38,614 --> 00:18:41,712
Sorry we didn’t tell you but... well there it is.

273
00:18:41,805 --> 00:18:43,238
So that’s it for basketball.

274
00:18:45,983 --> 00:18:47,892
- Why should it be?
- You’ll see.

275
00:18:48,767 --> 00:18:51,415
You think you can do it all now but, one day you’ll look up

276
00:18:51,486 --> 00:18:53,699
and realise all you have to live with are your mistakes.

277
00:18:54,190 --> 00:18:57,538
It’s not a mistake dad. We’re both happy. It’s a good thing.

278
00:18:57,610 --> 00:18:59,708
I was talking about my mistakes too Nathan.

279
00:18:59,807 --> 00:19:01,548
Sooner or later we all choose a path.

280
00:19:02,125 --> 00:19:05,347
Sometimes you never look back and sometimes life forces you to.

281
00:19:06,711 --> 00:19:07,609
Okay…

282
00:19:10,654 --> 00:19:12,939
I’m just gonna let you get some rest, alright dad?

283
00:19:15,167 --> 00:19:15,868
Nathan.

284
00:19:19,273 --> 00:19:20,899
Would you ask Lucas to drop by?

285
00:19:21,987 --> 00:19:23,631
I’d really like to see your brother.

286
00:19:43,005 --> 00:19:44,812
Hey! This is great, man.

287
00:19:46,011 --> 00:19:47,552
Hey, shouldn’t you be home getting ready?

288
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:50,746
- Yeah but I… I needed to talk to you first.
- Yeah?

289
00:19:50,946 --> 00:19:53,133
I just went down to the hospital and…

290
00:19:55,271 --> 00:19:56,593
he said he wants to see you.

291
00:20:03,551 --> 00:20:08,235
Luke, when I was younger, I thought I had the best of things;

292
00:20:08,334 --> 00:20:09,812
I had a father in my life

293
00:20:11,550 --> 00:20:16,526
but if you want my advice; just stay away, okay?

294
00:20:16,935 --> 00:20:19,188
The best thing I ever did was get emancipated.

295
00:20:21,251 --> 00:20:22,613
It feels good to be free.

296
00:20:23,951 --> 00:20:24,686
Lucas?

297
00:20:26,085 --> 00:20:27,663
- Oh hey, Nathan.
- Hey.

298
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:30,919
I guess a congratulations are in order.

299
00:20:33,119 --> 00:20:36,371
Well anyway, I was just heading out so… see ya tonight.

300
00:20:40,005 --> 00:20:41,480
It’s a brave new world, huh?

301
00:20:43,877 --> 00:20:45,469
Hm, this is interesting.

302
00:20:45,786 --> 00:20:48,701
Oh yeah. From the mind of Brooke Davis.

303
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:52,597
For a twenty dollar donation, you get a fake ID…

304
00:20:53,157 --> 00:20:55,781
and… Nathan and Haley get the cash.

305
00:20:57,818 --> 00:20:58,454
Go on!

306
00:21:04,731 --> 00:21:05,771
Make me younger.

307
00:21:06,606 --> 00:21:08,985
Ready? One, two, three; smile!

308
00:21:15,499 --> 00:21:19,056
So I found a course catalogue in the recycling bin.

309
00:21:19,364 --> 00:21:20,624
Were you thinking about college?

310
00:21:20,813 --> 00:21:23,982
A couple of classes. And now, not so much.

311
00:21:24,049 --> 00:21:28,181
- Why not? Coz I’m back?
- No, it’s just. It can wait.

312
00:21:28,237 --> 00:21:28,943
For what?

313
00:21:36,844 --> 00:21:40,479
So... Nathan told me Dan wants to see me.

314
00:21:40,981 --> 00:21:43,306
Way to bury the lead. Why didn’t you tell me?

315
00:21:43,383 --> 00:21:44,217
I just did.

316
00:21:44,586 --> 00:21:45,343
You gonna go?

317
00:21:46,203 --> 00:21:48,261
I dunno. What do you think?

318
00:21:49,393 --> 00:21:52,229
I think it’s a tough call where Dan’s concerned.

319
00:21:54,918 --> 00:21:57,550
Let me tell you a little dirty secret about being a parent;

320
00:21:57,682 --> 00:21:59,905
I don’t have a road map anymore than you do.

321
00:22:00,313 --> 00:22:04,087
This time the only advice that I can give you is whatever you decide with Dan…

322
00:22:04,748 --> 00:22:05,659
be careful.

323
00:22:11,297 --> 00:22:13,733
Hm… here you go mom.

324
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:15,828
You’re a kid again.

325
00:22:18,033 --> 00:22:21,450
You know, on second thought, no thanks.

326
00:22:29,735 --> 00:22:32,044
- Hey old man, there you are.
- Keith!

327
00:22:32,202 --> 00:22:33,651
Bought you a decent cup of coffee.

328
00:22:34,031 --> 00:22:34,696
Thanks.

329
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:37,854
Yeah, of course it’s cold because I stopped by the hospital first,

330
00:22:37,932 --> 00:22:39,288
nurse told me you checked out.

331
00:22:39,493 --> 00:22:41,828
That’s a pretty big risk to be taking with your eyesight.

332
00:22:43,089 --> 00:22:46,305
Who are you to be lecturing me about risk?

333
00:22:47,138 --> 00:22:49,243
Oh, here it comes; the old Whitey dodge.

334
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:52,892
Hey, we’re talking about you.

335
00:22:53,973 --> 00:22:55,770
You said you went to the hospital.

336
00:22:57,092 --> 00:23:01,925
How much can I bet that you didn’t bother to go see your brother while you were there?

337
00:23:02,002 --> 00:23:04,541
- That is not the point.
- That’s exactly the point.

338
00:23:05,483 --> 00:23:11,218
Look Keith, we both know that Dan is a world class jerk but he’s still your brother.

339
00:23:12,446 --> 00:23:16,041
When you get to be my age, and you’re facing something like this…

340
00:23:16,988 --> 00:23:24,642
damn surgery, then the most important thing in your life becomes your life.

341
00:23:26,157 --> 00:23:28,789
And the person you were when you lived it.

342
00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:32,403
Um, I’m pretty sure that Dan doesn’t wanna see me.

343
00:23:32,491 --> 00:23:36,443
So what?! You be the better man, Keith.

344
00:23:39,797 --> 00:23:41,604
Alright, what happened this time?

345
00:23:42,444 --> 00:23:43,254
I kind of...

346
00:23:45,655 --> 00:23:46,956
slept with Deb.

347
00:23:51,542 --> 00:23:53,632
Oh, forget everything I said.

348
00:23:56,635 --> 00:23:58,123
Hey Brooke, what are you wearing tonight?

349
00:23:58,209 --> 00:24:00,436
I mean it’s more of a party than a wedding reception right?

350
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:02,341
Brooke!

351
00:24:04,211 --> 00:24:06,622
Nice! We are gonna get you a ten yet.

352
00:24:07,308 --> 00:24:09,705
Hey, is Peyton around? She said she was gonna loan me something to wear.

353
00:24:09,791 --> 00:24:10,809
Yeah, she’ll be out in a second.

354
00:24:14,110 --> 00:24:17,982
- Oh my god! Where did you get that picture of her?
- You gotta love modern technology.

355
00:24:18,044 --> 00:24:20,819
It’s for a little project that I’m doing, to help expand her horizons.

356
00:24:21,019 --> 00:24:23,312
By posting nude pictures of her on the internet?

357
00:24:23,481 --> 00:24:26,733
Don’t worry. She’s gonna thank me when she sees the guys that are lining up.

358
00:24:28,045 --> 00:24:30,702
Oh, he’s cute. Oh, really cute.

359
00:24:31,126 --> 00:24:33,303
- Oh that’s what I’m talking about.
- Down girl.

360
00:24:33,558 --> 00:24:36,513
You can look at the menu all you want but from now on, you eat at home.

361
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:56,610
- Great party dawg.
- Hey. Thanks Fergie, enjoy.

362
00:25:13,675 --> 00:25:15,154
- Hi.
- Hey.

363
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:19,804
Kind of ironic, it says; ‘Naley Forever’ but it’s a temporary tattoo.

364
00:25:21,637 --> 00:25:22,568
It’s symbolic.

365
00:25:27,612 --> 00:25:29,009
They’re here! They’re here!

366
00:25:29,425 --> 00:25:32,168
- Mouth, did you get the extra spray string? 
- Sorta.

367
00:25:51,619 --> 00:25:54,860
They were outta spray string so… I got cheese instead.

368
00:26:32,626 --> 00:26:33,291
Lucas.

369
00:26:33,911 --> 00:26:35,708
- Oh hey, Mrs Scott.
- Hi.

370
00:26:35,851 --> 00:26:38,007
- Nice to see you.
- I brought a gift.

371
00:26:38,227 --> 00:26:40,337
Oh, great, ah just set it on the table.

372
00:26:40,930 --> 00:26:41,820
Okay, thanks.

373
00:26:47,261 --> 00:26:48,488
Are you with Nathan or Haley?

374
00:26:49,473 --> 00:26:50,266
Peyton.

375
00:26:58,574 --> 00:27:01,784
- Shot in the dark; ‘Lust Factor’?
- Definitely.

376
00:27:02,346 --> 00:27:07,074
Okay… my friend put me on there as a joke. I’m not looking.

377
00:27:07,150 --> 00:27:08,558
I’m up to a 9.6.	

378
00:27:09,654 --> 00:27:11,266
I’m not on the market.

379
00:27:11,385 --> 00:27:14,138
Well I’m on your page so I'm me sometime.

380
00:27:15,968 --> 00:27:20,732
Are you crazy? What were you thinking, letting him go? He’s gotta be like a 9.5...

381
00:27:20,787 --> 00:27:24,420
6. And remind me to kill you later. How many more are coming?

382
00:27:29,865 --> 00:27:31,726
I thi... I need something to drink.

383
00:27:31,799 --> 00:27:34,620
Brooke! Do not fake cough me!

384
00:27:36,493 --> 00:27:38,219
- Deb, you came.
- Yeah.

385
00:27:38,383 --> 00:27:42,483
I’m not sure why, this is... it’s pretty wild.

386
00:27:42,858 --> 00:27:44,373
Hm, looks fine.

387
00:27:46,124 --> 00:27:47,178
You wanna dance?

388
00:27:53,231 --> 00:27:56,093
No... I think I’ll leave the dancing to the kids.

389
00:28:00,891 --> 00:28:04,319
- Uh, you know, let’s sit.
- Yeah okay.

390
00:28:04,424 --> 00:28:05,160
You're hungry?

391
00:28:07,264 --> 00:28:09,814
How can you be so at ease with all of this?

392
00:28:11,437 --> 00:28:13,086
I know this is hard for you, Deb.

393
00:28:13,168 --> 00:28:15,585
Oh don’t tell me you honestly think this can work?

394
00:28:16,865 --> 00:28:19,271
Haley’s been like a daughter to me.

395
00:28:19,394 --> 00:28:21,422
And Nathan used to be a son to me.

396
00:28:22,329 --> 00:28:25,287
On top of that, you can’t possibly know what they’re up against Karen.

397
00:28:25,355 --> 00:28:27,377
You didn’t get married when you were their age.

398
00:28:29,788 --> 00:28:31,763
- Mom?
- Mrs Scott, you came.

399
00:28:32,265 --> 00:28:34,022
Yeah. Thought I should.

400
00:28:34,687 --> 00:28:36,004
I’m really glad you did.

401
00:28:39,879 --> 00:28:41,400
Wanna come meet my parents?

402
00:28:44,604 --> 00:28:46,908
Oh this is Dan, I really should take it.

403
00:28:59,858 --> 00:29:00,467
Hi.

404
00:29:04,148 --> 00:29:06,038
I was wondering if you were ever gonna come visit me.

405
00:29:06,221 --> 00:29:10,103
I was just… waiting for the right time

406
00:29:10,497 --> 00:29:14,118
and... I guess then I realised there wasn’t gonna be a right time so…

407
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:16,177
here I am.

408
00:29:18,260 --> 00:29:21,675
I’m sorry Dan. About what happened with me and Deb. I...

409
00:29:22,345 --> 00:29:23,888
I wish I can take it all back.

410
00:29:25,177 --> 00:29:29,749
I haven’t been much of a brother to you Keith, or a husband to Deb, or a father.

411
00:29:31,752 --> 00:29:36,502
I guess I’ve just had other things on my mind; success, business.

412
00:29:40,685 --> 00:29:44,813
Well, you just worry about getting well. Okay?

413
00:29:45,125 --> 00:29:49,129
I’ll help out at the dealership till you… get back on your feet.

414
00:29:49,257 --> 00:29:51,893
I know you’re gonna have a very strong opinion about this but...

415
00:29:51,955 --> 00:29:53,623
Actually that would take a load off my mind.

416
00:29:57,559 --> 00:30:02,026
- You’re okay with that?
- Things change. People change.

417
00:30:04,878 --> 00:30:07,259
Oh, well okay then.

418
00:30:09,051 --> 00:30:12,363
Um… get well Danny.

419
00:30:27,406 --> 00:30:28,400
There you guys are.

420
00:30:28,901 --> 00:30:30,232
- Hey.
- Hey.

421
00:30:30,335 --> 00:30:33,247
Oh, now we’ve lost Nathan’s mom somewhere.

422
00:30:33,355 --> 00:30:34,532
She actually came?

423
00:30:34,769 --> 00:30:36,201
Guess she’s trying to make an effort.

424
00:30:36,784 --> 00:30:39,423
Well then… we will too.

425
00:30:40,436 --> 00:30:42,956
Oh, but first we have something to tell you.

426
00:30:43,376 --> 00:30:46,606
Oh yeah, it’s ah, well it’s kind of a wedding present.

427
00:30:47,002 --> 00:30:49,827
- Ah, for us.
- Okay. What is it?

428
00:30:49,921 --> 00:30:53,260
Well, we got ourselves an RV.

429
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:56,646
You see, we always said when the last bird flew, we’d sell the coop,

430
00:30:56,830 --> 00:31:00,429
buy an RV and hit the road. Who knew someday was gonna be today?

431
00:31:01,126 --> 00:31:03,249
You guys are leaving town?

432
00:31:03,651 --> 00:31:04,766
Oh baby.

433
00:31:06,370 --> 00:31:12,503
The beauty of a motor home is that we can launch a sneak attack anytime and anywhere.

434
00:31:13,716 --> 00:31:15,905
This is how we set each other free.

435
00:31:35,430 --> 00:31:39,091
Uh... Peyton, right?

436
00:31:39,175 --> 00:31:41,114
- How do you know?
- Lucky guess.

437
00:31:44,954 --> 00:31:46,419
Coach! How are ya?

438
00:31:46,771 --> 00:31:49,813
Well I’m old, but I wasn’t always that way.

439
00:31:50,222 --> 00:31:53,879
There was a time when I was young and in love like the two of you.

440
00:31:55,732 --> 00:31:56,305
Here.

441
00:31:57,273 --> 00:32:01,482
Camilla stitched that during the first year of our marriage. It’s a baby blanket.

442
00:32:02,285 --> 00:32:05,704
Course, we spent all those years just the two of us in the nest

443
00:32:05,762 --> 00:32:09,566
but I think she’d like that to go to somebody she would have been really fond of.

444
00:32:09,694 --> 00:32:14,138
Oh coach, that’s so sweet of you, thank you, but I’m not pregnant.

445
00:32:15,957 --> 00:32:19,981
Well you never know; he is a Scott after all.

446
00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:22,961
Would you excuse me for just a minute?

447
00:32:23,255 --> 00:32:26,237
Yeah. Thanks coach.

448
00:32:27,177 --> 00:32:28,454
Okay, foot on orange.

449
00:32:32,525 --> 00:32:34,388
What do I have to do? Pee on a stick?

450
00:32:34,788 --> 00:32:38,173
Um… if that’s your kicks. Do I know what we’re talking about?

451
00:32:38,259 --> 00:32:40,501
Brooke, I am not pregnant.

452
00:32:41,767 --> 00:32:42,344
Look.

453
00:32:44,511 --> 00:32:46,933
It’s a birth control patch. I’ve had it for weeks.

454
00:32:49,503 --> 00:32:53,866
- So it really is just about love.
- Yeah. What other reason do we need?

455
00:32:57,419 --> 00:32:59,334
You did a good thing here Luke man.

456
00:32:59,609 --> 00:33:00,510
Thanks Skills.

457
00:33:01,724 --> 00:33:03,645
Hey, so I was thinking about Charleston right?

458
00:33:04,330 --> 00:33:07,100
And about how you could have been dis new person.

459
00:33:09,007 --> 00:33:13,480
Yeah well see, I remember the person that you used to be.

460
00:33:15,445 --> 00:33:16,901
Why not just be him again?

461
00:33:18,136 --> 00:33:19,036
Trust me.

462
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:24,202
I mean you so lucky dawg, you surrounded by so many people who you love.

463
00:33:25,993 --> 00:33:29,045
You see, now you gotta make yourself one of those people.

464
00:33:31,257 --> 00:33:32,813
- Alright?
- Yeah.

465
00:33:33,608 --> 00:33:36,244
My dawg. I’ll be back

466
00:33:40,294 --> 00:33:43,135
- Hey.
- Oh hey! Where you been hiding?

467
00:33:43,305 --> 00:33:45,700
You know, just… had some things to take care of.

468
00:33:46,454 --> 00:33:49,290
Luke, I know how much Charleston meant to you.

469
00:33:50,185 --> 00:33:54,635
But… looks like I’m gonna be taking over the dealership until Dan gets better so…

470
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:56,677
we’re gonna be living here for a while.

471
00:33:57,748 --> 00:33:58,465
You okay with that?

472
00:33:59,755 --> 00:34:02,837
Yeah. You know it’s probably better to get a fresh start with the people

473
00:34:02,950 --> 00:34:04,865
- who actually matter in your life right?
- Yeah.

474
00:34:08,647 --> 00:34:11,906
Um… speaking of, excuse me.

475
00:34:18,126 --> 00:34:19,984
You ladies throw a pretty rocking party.

476
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:22,344
Yeah well, doesn’t suck.

477
00:34:23,721 --> 00:34:25,003
What are you smiling about?

478
00:34:25,253 --> 00:34:26,855
You didn’t read it, did you?

479
00:34:27,860 --> 00:34:30,026
- The letter.
- Oh.

480
00:34:30,389 --> 00:34:31,486
Course we did!

481
00:34:33,517 --> 00:34:36,230
Oh, so you were ok with the P.S. about the three of us?

482
00:34:36,302 --> 00:34:38,150
- Yeah, sure.
- Absolutely.

483
00:34:38,837 --> 00:34:40,362
Really? Really?

484
00:34:40,455 --> 00:34:44,274
So the threesome with the hot fudge didn’t bother you, huh?

485
00:34:48,968 --> 00:34:50,582
I knew we should have read the letter.

486
00:34:50,669 --> 00:34:51,892
We thought you’d left town.

487
00:34:52,435 --> 00:34:54,745
So we, sort of, burned it.

488
00:34:55,504 --> 00:34:58,252
Burned it, wow... You know what?

489
00:34:59,334 --> 00:35:04,534
I’m glad you didn’t read it. I mean all that stuff I said it’s not important now.

490
00:35:06,321 --> 00:35:08,845
And what matters now is that the three of us…

491
00:35:10,064 --> 00:35:11,273
we’re gonna be okay.

492
00:35:19,175 --> 00:35:19,988
Hey.

493
00:35:20,565 --> 00:35:21,186
Keith!

494
00:35:25,047 --> 00:35:28,245
Well… I’m back. I…

495
00:35:29,034 --> 00:35:32,264
I’ve decided to run the dealership for Dan, at least for a little while.

496
00:35:32,347 --> 00:35:34,042
You’ve given up a lot for Dan.

497
00:35:34,901 --> 00:35:36,806
He doesn’t deserve a brother like you.

498
00:35:40,385 --> 00:35:41,824
Actually, he deserves better.

499
00:35:51,301 --> 00:35:51,993
Mom.

500
00:35:53,487 --> 00:35:54,639
You met Haley’s parents?

501
00:35:54,998 --> 00:35:58,264
Hi, I’m Lydia James, this is my husband Jim.

502
00:35:58,403 --> 00:35:59,180
Hi, nice to meet you.

503
00:35:59,278 --> 00:35:59,917
Hi.

504
00:36:01,069 --> 00:36:04,740
Sorry to hear about your husband. How’s he doing?

505
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:11,438
He’s... he’s struggling with a new reality, I suppose we both are.

506
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:20,025
Well, I look forward to the day when we can all break bread and…

507
00:36:20,368 --> 00:36:24,839
argue about religion and politics and how best to raise our grandchildren.

508
00:36:24,909 --> 00:36:27,162
Yeah, no hurry on the last one by the way.

509
00:36:35,589 --> 00:36:37,075
Well you’ve raised a fine man.

510
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:39,521
- He’s not a man.
- Sorry?

511
00:36:39,630 --> 00:36:44,033
I said he’s not a man, he’s a boy and none of this would have happened

512
00:36:44,104 --> 00:36:46,665
if you people had had enough common sense to stop it!

513
00:36:46,736 --> 00:36:47,780
- Mom!
- No!

514
00:36:47,909 --> 00:36:52,300
I am not going to stand here and make nice and pretend like this is all okay when it isn’t.

515
00:36:52,368 --> 00:36:55,568
Then don’t! It’s one thing for you to raise your voice at me

516
00:36:55,614 --> 00:36:58,481
but don’t come in here and dump on my parents!

517
00:36:58,833 --> 00:37:01,584
We made our decision, we got married and we’re happy

518
00:37:01,645 --> 00:37:04,261
and if you’re not here to celebrate with us, then you should just go home

519
00:37:04,318 --> 00:37:05,767
because I don’t want you here!

520
00:37:30,436 --> 00:37:31,562
Nicely played.

521
00:37:31,712 --> 00:37:35,938
I am so sorry. As if things aren’t bad enough with your family.

522
00:37:36,016 --> 00:37:37,383
You couldn’t make it any worse.

523
00:37:39,017 --> 00:37:40,194
You know what’s weird?

524
00:37:40,624 --> 00:37:45,882
Even with my parents leaving town, I have never felt safer in my life.

525
00:37:46,759 --> 00:37:47,834
You know what’s weirder?

526
00:37:48,473 --> 00:37:51,759
Seeing you take my mom’s head off back there actually kinda turned me on.

527
00:37:54,131 --> 00:37:56,363
- Five minutes in the elevator?
- How bout right here?

528
00:38:14,039 --> 00:38:17,463
I forgot how beautiful Nathan’s smile was until tonight.

529
00:38:18,380 --> 00:38:20,243
What hurts most is…

530
00:38:22,225 --> 00:38:23,966
it went away when he saw me.

531
00:38:24,109 --> 00:38:25,067
What happened?

532
00:38:25,235 --> 00:38:28,021
I bitched out Haley’s parents and made things worse.

533
00:38:29,434 --> 00:38:33,796
- Nice work.
- It’s not funny Dan. He has a new family now.

534
00:38:53,198 --> 00:38:54,241
Don’t worry.

535
00:38:55,250 --> 00:38:57,804
I promise, together we’ll get our son back.

536
00:39:04,296 --> 00:39:10,394
Ah, I guess it’s no surprise that some would criticize us; call us unfit parents.

537
00:39:10,493 --> 00:39:13,133
And normally… they would be right.

538
00:39:14,895 --> 00:39:17,973
And for those who say they’re too young, let me just say;

539
00:39:18,311 --> 00:39:22,073
hell you can drive at sixteen, go to war at eighteen,

540
00:39:22,335 --> 00:39:25,520
you can drink at twenty-one and retire at sixty-five

541
00:39:26,021 --> 00:39:27,935
so how old do you have to be…

542
00:39:28,427 --> 00:39:29,988
before your love…

543
00:39:30,797 --> 00:39:31,863
is real?

544
00:39:36,924 --> 00:39:38,617
So here’s to you Haley-bub,

545
00:39:39,835 --> 00:39:42,687
and Nathan; she’s your headache now.

546
00:39:48,616 --> 00:39:53,300
I think everybody… knows that Nathan and I got of to a pretty sketchy start.

547
00:39:53,741 --> 00:39:56,337
- Nathan; mutual hatred sound about right?
- Worse!

548
00:39:56,997 --> 00:39:57,792
Yeah.

549
00:40:02,061 --> 00:40:03,847
You see, then a funny thing happened;

550
00:40:05,922 --> 00:40:10,883
Haley. She showed me that you can find the good in everybody,

551
00:40:11,015 --> 00:40:12,592
if you just give them a chance.

552
00:40:13,591 --> 00:40:15,014
The benefit of the doubt.

553
00:40:18,977 --> 00:40:24,580
Sometimes, people disappoint you. Sometimes they surprise you.

554
00:40:28,234 --> 00:40:30,139
But you never really get to know them…

555
00:40:30,631 --> 00:40:34,409
until you listen for what’s in their hearts and that’s what Haley did with Nathan.

556
00:40:34,563 --> 00:40:35,854
That’s what we should do for them.

557
00:40:36,093 --> 00:40:39,396
So for you sceptics out there, prepare to be surprised.

558
00:40:41,127 --> 00:40:42,857
So this is to my…

559
00:40:43,364 --> 00:40:44,260
brother

560
00:40:45,669 --> 00:40:49,278
and my little sis in-law,

561
00:40:50,804 --> 00:40:51,869
and in love.

562
00:40:54,187 --> 00:40:55,519
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

563
00:42:36,535 --> 00:42:38,018
I’m glad you came, son.
