1
00:00:01,073 --> 00:00:02,698
Okay, here’s what you need to know.

2
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:03,645
I’ll tell you what…

3
00:00:03,911 --> 00:00:04,914
I’ll leave them alone…

4
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:06,783
if you move in with me.

5
00:00:07,193 --> 00:00:08,401
I’m running for president.

6
00:00:08,483 --> 00:00:10,669
You realise I’ve been class president since seventh grade?

7
00:00:10,848 --> 00:00:12,359
Well game on, Vivica.

8
00:00:12,707 --> 00:00:13,614
Erica.

9
00:00:14,223 --> 00:00:14,960
Whatever.

10
00:00:15,438 --> 00:00:18,657
If you just tell me what Dan has said or done, we could fight him together.

11
00:00:19,056 --> 00:00:19,794
No…

12
00:00:21,391 --> 00:00:22,574
Mom, we can’t.

13
00:00:28,259 --> 00:00:29,271
Go back to sleep.

14
00:00:30,125 --> 00:00:30,853
I’ve got her.

15
00:00:32,727 --> 00:00:35,086
I’m the one who threw the brick through your car window.

16
00:00:35,839 --> 00:00:38,174
I’m not sure we can be friends anymore, Mouth.

17
00:00:40,023 --> 00:00:42,194
If you wanna go, you should go.

18
00:00:42,997 --> 00:00:43,935
If you do…

19
00:00:46,111 --> 00:00:47,155
we’re done.

20
00:00:49,098 --> 00:00:51,256
Turns out that popular people don’t vote

21
00:00:51,337 --> 00:00:54,276
and now that Felix has bailed on me, three days before the election…

22
00:00:54,370 --> 00:00:56,509
Yeah, who goes on a cruise in the middle of a school week anyway?

23
00:00:56,586 --> 00:00:57,538
Rich people.

24
00:00:59,084 --> 00:01:00,004
Haley?

25
00:01:01,584 --> 00:01:03,124
I’m sorry, Nathan.

26
00:01:04,201 --> 00:01:05,070
She’s gone.

27
00:01:56,112 --> 00:01:57,893
Octavio Paz once wrote;

28
00:01:58,917 --> 00:02:01,957
Solitude is the profoundest fact of the human condition…

29
00:02:03,371 --> 00:02:06,147
man is the only being who knows he is alone.

30
00:02:16,761 --> 00:02:19,705
You know, if Bogans keeps drilling threes, the Cats will be tough to beat.

31
00:02:20,606 --> 00:02:21,420
How’d you sleep?

32
00:02:21,712 --> 00:02:22,480
Fine.

33
00:02:22,664 --> 00:02:23,749
Great, grab a plate.

34
00:02:24,149 --> 00:02:27,047
Ah, actually… I usually grab something on the way to school.

35
00:02:27,134 --> 00:02:29,495
Come on, sit. We’re civilised here.

36
00:02:30,314 --> 00:02:31,189
Dan?

37
00:02:31,925 --> 00:02:32,653
I’m home.

38
00:02:32,745 --> 00:02:33,775
We’re in the kitchen, Deb.

39
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:36,253
Oh…

40
00:02:37,205 --> 00:02:37,922
Lucas.

41
00:02:38,229 --> 00:02:38,869
Hey.

42
00:02:39,904 --> 00:02:41,746
Uh… where’s Nathan?

43
00:02:41,967 --> 00:02:43,150
Nathan’s not here, Deb.

44
00:02:43,882 --> 00:02:45,683
Lucas is gonna be staying with us for a while.

45
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:47,793
What?

46
00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:49,340
You didn’t tell her.

47
00:02:50,351 --> 00:02:51,429
You better get to school.

48
00:02:59,366 --> 00:03:00,373
Nice work, Deb.

49
00:03:00,937 --> 00:03:02,273
That should make him feel right at home.

50
00:03:02,421 --> 00:03:04,193
This isn’t him home, Dan.

51
00:03:04,966 --> 00:03:06,405
What were you thinking?

52
00:03:06,682 --> 00:03:10,705
I’m gone three days and you invite Lucas to stay in our son’s room without asking me?

53
00:03:10,762 --> 00:03:12,774
Hey, Lucas is my son too, Deb.

54
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,991
And before you start getting upset, there is some good news.

55
00:03:15,047 --> 00:03:17,112
Like what, Keith’s moved into the guest room?

56
00:03:18,134 --> 00:03:19,331
Haley left Nathan.

57
00:03:22,273 --> 00:03:23,076
When?

58
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:24,110
A few days ago.

59
00:03:24,775 --> 00:03:26,953
Its happening, Deb. Just like we hoped it would.

60
00:03:28,677 --> 00:03:31,073
Well, how is he? He must be devastated.

61
00:03:31,176 --> 00:03:33,296
Well, ask him yourself. When he moves back in.

62
00:03:33,878 --> 00:03:35,718
He’s moving back in? He said that?

63
00:03:35,809 --> 00:03:37,980
Not yet, but trust me…

64
00:03:39,518 --> 00:03:40,736
it’s just a matter of time.

65
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:49,090
Okay, I still can not believe Haley left Nathan for Chris.

66
00:03:49,167 --> 00:03:53,084
She didn’t, okay? She left for herself. The tour is an amazing opportunity.

67
00:03:53,156 --> 00:03:54,835
Yeah, to screw up her marriage.

68
00:03:54,912 --> 00:03:59,453
Okay, just because she is married does not mean she has to give up her dreams. Okay?

69
00:03:59,524 --> 00:04:01,016
She’s really, really talented.

70
00:04:01,082 --> 00:04:04,671
I know she is and that’s great but you don’t think Chris has anything to do with this?

71
00:04:04,722 --> 00:04:07,973
No, I don’t. She is not into him. She told me.

72
00:04:08,055 --> 00:04:11,475
Okay, let’s think about what Nathan was when Haley met him;

73
00:04:11,639 --> 00:04:14,619
good looking, rude, sexy,

74
00:04:14,721 --> 00:04:16,882
arrogant and talented.

75
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:18,306
Okay, right, like Chris.

76
00:04:18,377 --> 00:04:21,470
Yeah, and then Haley changed Nathan, for the better,

77
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,337
but I’m thinking maybe she misses that challenge.

78
00:04:24,794 --> 00:04:26,329
You really think she changed Nathan?

79
00:04:26,401 --> 00:04:29,124
Yeah. I mean, before Haley, Nathan was, like,

80
00:04:29,181 --> 00:04:31,142
the ‘bad-boy of Tree Hill’…

81
00:04:31,223 --> 00:04:32,539
and now he’s just…

82
00:04:32,806 --> 00:04:34,071
‘Pod Nathan’.

83
00:04:56,532 --> 00:04:59,015
Dude… you look like ass.

84
00:04:59,137 --> 00:05:00,090
You should smell me.

85
00:05:01,361 --> 00:05:03,558
You know, I haven’t seen you around school lately.

86
00:05:04,872 --> 00:05:05,651
You mind if I come in?

87
00:05:05,728 --> 00:05:09,547
Actually… now’s not really a good… good time.

88
00:05:13,142 --> 00:05:14,201
You know, man, I…

89
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:16,788
I’m really missing Haley.

90
00:05:18,108 --> 00:05:19,891
She aint even bothered to call me.

91
00:05:21,678 --> 00:05:22,962
It must be harder for you.

92
00:05:23,284 --> 00:05:26,141
Yeah, it’s twelve weeks.

93
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:29,546
I’ll be fine. We’ll… we’ll work it out when she gets back.

94
00:05:31,308 --> 00:05:32,977
I’m just concerned, man.

95
00:05:33,361 --> 00:05:34,942
Yeah, well don’t be.

96
00:05:46,166 --> 00:05:48,352
So, you left early this morning.

97
00:05:48,455 --> 00:05:51,194
Yeah, well I had to drop off Jenny at my mom’s and then…

98
00:05:51,276 --> 00:05:54,168
stop by the café, talk to Karen. What’s going on?

99
00:05:54,236 --> 00:05:55,602
Well, um…

100
00:05:55,966 --> 00:05:59,201
Ted Leo is doing an in-store-run rally tonight; do you wanna go?

101
00:05:59,757 --> 00:06:00,636
I can’t.

102
00:06:00,737 --> 00:06:02,228
Come on, it’s gonna be fun.

103
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:04,814
Yeah, well, fun’s not really an option these days.

104
00:06:04,895 --> 00:06:07,169
I mean, other than Jenny; school, finding a job,

105
00:06:07,231 --> 00:06:08,818
there’s not really room for anything else.

106
00:06:09,918 --> 00:06:11,597
Yeah. Sure.

107
00:06:11,993 --> 00:06:13,368
I understand, it’s cool.

108
00:06:18,803 --> 00:06:19,779
You coming?

109
00:06:25,433 --> 00:06:26,508
Campaign CD?

110
00:06:26,706 --> 00:06:29,160
No, I’m more of an MP3 girl.

111
00:06:33,783 --> 00:06:34,567
Coach Durham!

112
00:06:34,848 --> 00:06:37,705
I was wondering if the election week schedules were out yet.

113
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:39,205
Yeah, hot of the press.

114
00:06:39,333 --> 00:06:40,167
Thanks.

115
00:06:40,634 --> 00:06:44,038
Oh, if you want, I could give Brooke Davis hers next period.

116
00:06:44,177 --> 00:06:45,237
We have Health together.

117
00:06:45,319 --> 00:06:46,967
Well, that’s nice of you, Erica.

118
00:06:47,149 --> 00:06:51,064
I was afraid you girls’d be pulling each others pigtails by this time.

119
00:07:01,627 --> 00:07:04,218
Oh, I know I’ve been a little busy with the election

120
00:07:04,274 --> 00:07:05,763
but how could you hold out on me like this?

121
00:07:05,825 --> 00:07:06,408
What?

122
00:07:06,686 --> 00:07:08,222
Don’t play dumb with me, blondie.

123
00:07:08,277 --> 00:07:11,232
You’ve been playing house with Jake Jagielski and you weren’t gonna tell me?

124
00:07:11,288 --> 00:07:12,517
That, that’s nothing.

125
00:07:12,588 --> 00:07:16,572
Oh! I would say that living in a house together, with a baby, is definitely something.

126
00:07:16,659 --> 00:07:19,450
Next thing I know, you’re gonna tell me you two have been sharing a bed.

127
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:22,214
P. Sawyer!

128
00:07:22,363 --> 00:07:24,456
Hey, Freshman, hang these up for me, thanks.

129
00:07:24,528 --> 00:07:25,901
Okay, gimme details.

130
00:07:26,064 --> 00:07:28,430
Sadly, there aren’t any. Jake’s made very clear

131
00:07:28,496 --> 00:07:30,396
that he doesn’t have time for anything detaily.

132
00:07:30,468 --> 00:07:33,908
Okay, no, forget what he says because I have seen the way that that boy look at you.

133
00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:35,808
Okay, don’t you have Health class?

134
00:07:35,884 --> 00:07:37,657
I think I’m healthy enough.

135
00:07:37,743 --> 00:07:41,634
I have watched you mope over this guy for weeks; now you have him… in your bed.

136
00:07:41,716 --> 00:07:42,336
So?

137
00:07:42,403 --> 00:07:43,760
So take a chance.

138
00:07:45,786 --> 00:07:50,461
Okay, so we’re gonna pick up where we left off, discussing the process of mitosis.

139
00:07:50,738 --> 00:07:54,916
The... Well, Mr Scott, long time no see.

140
00:07:56,857 --> 00:08:01,208
Okay, so as we discussed last time, mitosis is the process by which a single cell separates-

141
00:08:01,254 --> 00:08:02,903
It’s about time you pulled yourself together.

142
00:08:03,114 --> 00:08:04,024
Whatever.

143
00:08:04,582 --> 00:08:06,164
I’m only here coz my Playstation broke.

144
00:08:06,876 --> 00:08:08,514
Hey, man, are you nuts?

145
00:08:08,657 --> 00:08:09,635
Prophase.

146
00:08:10,327 --> 00:08:13,067
Pro-metaphase, anaphase and t-

147
00:08:14,787 --> 00:08:18,109
Okay, please tell me you are not drinking beer in my class.


148
00:08:18,407 --> 00:08:20,189
Technically, it’s malt liquor.

149
00:08:20,387 --> 00:08:21,166
Nathan!

150
00:08:21,253 --> 00:08:23,705
It’s okay. I bought enough to share.

151
00:08:27,904 --> 00:08:28,897
Come with me please.

152
00:08:30,762 --> 00:08:32,199
That’s a nice skirt Miss. Ham.

153
00:08:32,537 --> 00:08:35,195
You know, I bet if more teachers dressed like sluts,

154
00:08:35,278 --> 00:08:37,126
attendance in this place would skyrocket.

155
00:08:37,674 --> 00:08:38,498
Funny.

156
00:08:38,918 --> 00:08:40,878
Principle Turner’s gonna love that one.

157
00:08:51,606 --> 00:08:52,967
Haley, it’s me.

158
00:08:54,672 --> 00:08:59,172
I don’t know if you’re even getting any of these messages but please call me.

159
00:08:59,259 --> 00:09:01,395
It’s Nathan. I’m worried about him.

160
00:09:06,822 --> 00:09:08,342
Peyton, you ready? Let’s go.

161
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:10,192
Yeah, just one second.

162
00:09:11,058 --> 00:09:13,223
I just saw you, you look great. Come on.

163
00:09:20,001 --> 00:09:21,850
She feel a little warm here.

164
00:09:23,032 --> 00:09:24,154
You think she caught something?

165
00:09:24,236 --> 00:09:25,106
I don’t know.

166
00:09:25,255 --> 00:09:26,657
Hey, come here.

167
00:09:27,087 --> 00:09:28,946
How you doing, girly-girl?

168
00:09:29,207 --> 00:09:30,477
How you feeling?

169
00:09:32,502 --> 00:09:34,380
Okay, not good, I guess.

170
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:35,315
Here.

171
00:09:35,469 --> 00:09:36,744
Here, here.

172
00:09:36,882 --> 00:09:37,675
You’ve got her.

173
00:09:37,845 --> 00:09:39,411
Oh, it’s okay. It’s okay. Here…

174
00:09:40,665 --> 00:09:41,342
You...

175
00:09:44,254 --> 00:09:46,484
You go ahead. She can’t go out like this.

176
00:09:46,561 --> 00:09:48,168
Stop it, I will go with you.

177
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:49,346
We’ll take her to the doctor.

178
00:09:49,479 --> 00:09:50,277
With what?

179
00:09:51,547 --> 00:09:53,099
I don’t have health insurance.

180
00:09:58,805 --> 00:09:59,740
You know what…

181
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:01,787
Here.

182
00:10:03,497 --> 00:10:05,585
It’s the emergency money my dad left me.

183
00:10:06,436 --> 00:10:08,669
- Peyton, I can’t... 
- Jake. Come on.

184
00:10:08,730 --> 00:10:10,681
What’s a bigger emergency than a sick baby?

185
00:10:18,335 --> 00:10:19,636
You’re pretty great, you know that?

186
00:10:19,889 --> 00:10:21,556
Yeah, I have my moments.

187
00:10:30,537 --> 00:10:31,340
Hey, Andy?

188
00:10:31,862 --> 00:10:33,203
Uh… you seen my mom?

189
00:10:35,146 --> 00:10:35,913
Lucas.

190
00:10:37,351 --> 00:10:38,866
I think I’ll grade these somewhere else.

191
00:10:41,108 --> 00:10:42,415
You need help with those?

192
00:10:42,481 --> 00:10:43,183
Got em.

193
00:10:45,268 --> 00:10:46,798
I didn’t expect to see you today.

194
00:10:48,804 --> 00:10:50,678
Sit down, have a drink.

195
00:10:56,654 --> 00:10:58,226
I just wanted to see how you were doing.

196
00:10:58,532 --> 00:11:00,427
What does Dan have over you?

197
00:11:01,897 --> 00:11:02,659
Mom-

198
00:11:02,741 --> 00:11:05,188
It’s gotta be something because I’ve gone over this a million times

199
00:11:05,261 --> 00:11:07,533
and there’s… not other explanation…

200
00:11:07,836 --> 00:11:10,379
as to why you would choose to live with that snake.

201
00:11:11,682 --> 00:11:13,555
So, unless you wanna tell me…

202
00:11:21,204 --> 00:11:22,940
That’s two bucks for the soda.

203
00:11:32,018 --> 00:11:33,155
You wanna explain this?!

204
00:11:33,928 --> 00:11:35,096
Looks like a wedding gown.

205
00:11:35,371 --> 00:11:37,261
No one asked you to pay for my dress!

206
00:11:37,348 --> 00:11:39,698
You know, most women woulda just sent a thank you note,

207
00:11:39,852 --> 00:11:42,468
but if you’re gonna yell at me, at least come inside.

208
00:11:45,882 --> 00:11:47,655
I want you to stay away from our wedding!

209
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:49,037
Speaking of your wedding,

210
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:52,457
what exactly were you planning to do about guests?

211
00:11:53,041 --> 00:11:55,842
I mean, considering this whole thing is just an elaborate ruse

212
00:11:55,913 --> 00:11:57,535
designed to bring down my brother.

213
00:11:58,078 --> 00:12:01,070
I’m guessing that having your parents there might be a bit of a downer.

214
00:12:01,776 --> 00:12:04,525
I could lend you mine but… nah.

215
00:12:04,684 --> 00:12:06,067
I love your brother, Dan.

216
00:12:06,758 --> 00:12:08,391
Why won’t you just leave us alone?!

217
00:12:08,866 --> 00:12:10,674
Because Keith slept with Deb.

218
00:12:11,370 --> 00:12:13,742
Besides, I didn’t pay you to fall in love with him.

219
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,611
You know what? Screw it!

220
00:12:15,945 --> 00:12:17,228
I’ll just tell him the truth.

221
00:12:17,331 --> 00:12:19,015
Yeah, you could do that. Risky though.

222
00:12:20,107 --> 00:12:23,705
Uh… Keith’s no catch but I’m guessing even he’d have trouble dealing with this one.

223
00:12:28,871 --> 00:12:30,100
You like chess, Jules?

224
00:12:31,775 --> 00:12:33,371
Keith and I used to play all the time;

225
00:12:33,832 --> 00:12:35,257
until he got tired of losing.

226
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:39,582
There’s a manoeuvre, it’s called the Fork.

227
00:12:40,054 --> 00:12:42,956
Where you take one of your pieces and attack two of your opponents’ pieces.

228
00:12:43,207 --> 00:12:46,284
Basically, forcing him to choose which way he wants to lose.

229
00:12:47,953 --> 00:12:50,008
Makes it fun coz you get to watch them squirm.

230
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:53,811
Sorta like the situation you’re in now.

231
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:56,730
I mean, you could tell Keith about our arrangement,

232
00:12:57,150 --> 00:12:58,138
break his heart…

233
00:12:59,029 --> 00:13:01,068
which of course, was my plan all along.

234
00:13:03,002 --> 00:13:04,559
What is wrong with you?

235
00:13:04,779 --> 00:13:06,489
Or you could go through with the wedding…

236
00:13:06,776 --> 00:13:08,198
put on the pretty dress…

237
00:13:08,792 --> 00:13:10,748
and spend the rest of your married life,

238
00:13:11,107 --> 00:13:14,378
knowing I have the luxury of telling him anytime I want.

239
00:13:15,305 --> 00:13:17,496
Either way, in the end,

240
00:13:17,875 --> 00:13:18,796
I win.

241
00:13:24,486 --> 00:13:25,622
Checkmate.

242
00:13:45,612 --> 00:13:46,481
Lucas?

243
00:13:47,757 --> 00:13:49,328
We got a call from the principle.

244
00:13:50,271 --> 00:13:51,636
Yeah, I was just checking on him.

245
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:53,726
Uh… but since you guys are here.

246
00:13:53,803 --> 00:13:55,968
Stay. You’re his brother; you should be here for this.

247
00:14:03,505 --> 00:14:04,524
Look who it is;

248
00:14:04,715 --> 00:14:05,717
the Scott family.

249
00:14:05,814 --> 00:14:07,382
Sorry, I thought my son lived here.

250
00:14:07,678 --> 00:14:09,034
Kinda looks like you,

251
00:14:09,321 --> 00:14:10,622
only less pathetic.

252
00:14:11,077 --> 00:14:13,346
We heard about Haley, honey. What happened?

253
00:14:14,777 --> 00:14:16,074
Like you care.

254
00:14:17,053 --> 00:14:19,644
We do care, Nathan… all of us.

255
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:22,572
Right, mom, and you just showered Haley with hugs, didn’t you?

256
00:14:22,987 --> 00:14:25,864
Well I hate to disappoint you guys but she’ll be back in a few weeks.

257
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:26,919
Look, Nate.

258
00:14:27,001 --> 00:14:29,132
You can shut up. By the way.

259
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:32,112
How can you live like this, Nathan?

260
00:14:32,439 --> 00:14:34,226
This place is a pigsty.

261
00:14:34,738 --> 00:14:37,666
Eh, you’re skipping school, you’re drinking in class.

262
00:14:37,862 --> 00:14:39,310
It’s not worth it, son.

263
00:14:39,938 --> 00:14:42,193
Pissing your life away over some girl.

264
00:14:42,668 --> 00:14:43,709
Some girl?

265
00:14:44,292 --> 00:14:46,053
She’s my wife, dad!

266
00:14:46,172 --> 00:14:49,314
Really? Well someone may wanna tell her that.

267
00:14:50,501 --> 00:14:51,552
Hey, come on!

268
00:14:59,654 --> 00:15:00,887
Nice punch, son.

269
00:15:01,571 --> 00:15:03,707
It’s good to see there’s still a man in there somewhere.

270
00:15:21,461 --> 00:15:22,570
Oh, Nathan.

271
00:15:46,709 --> 00:15:48,701
‘I Slept With Brooke Davis But I’m Voting For Erica Marsh’

272
00:15:53,307 --> 00:15:54,135
Come here!

273
00:15:55,902 --> 00:15:58,195
First of all; no, you didn’t,

274
00:15:58,354 --> 00:16:00,509
and second of all, where did you get it?

275
00:16:00,586 --> 00:16:01,467
It’s a joke.

276
00:16:02,286 --> 00:16:03,073
Spill!

277
00:16:07,252 --> 00:16:08,332
Erica!

278
00:16:09,366 --> 00:16:10,999
Very clever.

279
00:16:11,081 --> 00:16:13,442
Thanks, cleverness does come in handy in politics.

280
00:16:13,549 --> 00:16:15,925
Unlike, say, cheerleading which is about, what,

281
00:16:15,987 --> 00:16:18,235
short skirts and who can make the bitchiest pyramid?

282
00:16:18,751 --> 00:16:21,516
Oh, that is it. Tomorrow, you’re going down.

283
00:16:21,624 --> 00:16:22,596
Are you sure?

284
00:16:22,689 --> 00:16:26,590
Coz, from what I’ve heard, ‘going down’ is really more your style.

285
00:16:35,883 --> 00:16:36,989
Oh, sorry.

286
00:16:37,204 --> 00:16:39,001
This is the athletic department.

287
00:16:39,374 --> 00:16:42,708
Mommy and me classes are around the corner at the ‘Y’.

288
00:16:42,950 --> 00:16:44,259
Good to see you too, coach.

289
00:16:44,961 --> 00:16:46,098
Jagielski…

290
00:16:46,384 --> 00:16:50,088
for someone who’s eager to get back in school, you’ve got a funny way of showing it.

291
00:16:50,148 --> 00:16:52,857
Oh, sorry. Jenny’s been sick. I had to stay home with her.

292
00:16:53,004 --> 00:16:55,247
Sick, huh? Here, do you mind?

293
00:16:56,805 --> 00:16:58,350
You know anything about babies, coach?

294
00:16:58,427 --> 00:17:00,931
Oh, I know more than they know bout me.

295
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:02,958
Right, look,

296
00:17:03,445 --> 00:17:05,912
I know that you’ve done a lot to get me back in here but…

297
00:17:05,968 --> 00:17:08,672
any mistake I make with Jenny could just make it easier for a judge

298
00:17:08,729 --> 00:17:10,653
to give joint custody to Nikki.

299
00:17:10,987 --> 00:17:12,040
Mistake, huh?

300
00:17:12,456 --> 00:17:14,591
You mean like dropping out of school?

301
00:17:16,051 --> 00:17:16,951
I know.

302
00:17:18,165 --> 00:17:20,622
- You’re right.
- Hell yes, I’m right.

303
00:17:20,744 --> 00:17:23,848
Now get your... A-S-S back to class,

304
00:17:23,925 --> 00:17:26,275
I’ll take care of little Miss. Jagielski here.

305
00:17:29,598 --> 00:17:30,730
Okay.

306
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,030
Go, get outta here.

307
00:17:32,266 --> 00:17:33,925
Thanks. Thanks, coach.

308
00:17:37,759 --> 00:17:41,968
Well, I hope you didn’t inherit your daddy’s free-throw percentage.

309
00:17:49,147 --> 00:17:49,914
Nathan.

310
00:17:50,767 --> 00:17:51,619
Hey.

311
00:17:53,821 --> 00:17:54,804
You heard from her?

312
00:17:57,845 --> 00:17:58,471
No.

313
00:18:05,586 --> 00:18:09,148
I would have never booked that show if I’d known that Chris was gonna be there.

314
00:18:09,426 --> 00:18:10,748
Not your fault.

315
00:18:11,413 --> 00:18:13,788
Haley’s a big girl; nobody made her get on that bus.

316
00:18:15,569 --> 00:18:17,429
Except for, maybe me.

317
00:18:22,964 --> 00:18:23,921
So, uh…

318
00:18:25,237 --> 00:18:26,307
you and Jagielski.

319
00:18:26,599 --> 00:18:29,128
What’s the deal? You two… still together?

320
00:18:30,967 --> 00:18:33,337
No. We’re just…

321
00:18:35,555 --> 00:18:36,875
I don’t really know what we are.

322
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:41,817
Looks, uh… looks pretty serious to me.

323
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:44,193
Not really.

324
00:18:45,146 --> 00:18:48,088
I don’t think there’s a possibility for me and Jake for…

325
00:18:49,010 --> 00:18:50,172
a lot of reasons.

326
00:18:51,785 --> 00:18:54,233
Yeah, trust me; you’re better off anyway.

327
00:18:55,123 --> 00:18:56,250
Love sucks.

328
00:18:57,284 --> 00:18:58,159
Nathan.

329
00:18:58,246 --> 00:18:59,814
No, think about it;

330
00:19:00,448 --> 00:19:01,560
Dan and Karen…

331
00:19:02,137 --> 00:19:03,068
you and Lucas…

332
00:19:05,035 --> 00:19:05,902
me and Haley.

333
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,282
You got it right, Peyton.

334
00:19:13,351 --> 00:19:14,652
People always leave.

335
00:19:40,785 --> 00:19:41,571
Hey.

336
00:19:42,679 --> 00:19:44,183
I just had to see it for myself.

337
00:19:44,809 --> 00:19:45,673
See what?

338
00:19:46,144 --> 00:19:48,305
This, you, here.

339
00:19:49,616 --> 00:19:52,104
Look, Nathan, it’s complicated.

340
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:55,064
You’re a fraud, Lucas. There’s nothing complicated about that.

341
00:19:56,408 --> 00:19:57,782
Look, why don’t you just come inside, man?

342
00:19:57,997 --> 00:20:00,137
Oh, so now you’re going to invite me into my own house?

343
00:20:00,618 --> 00:20:01,644
It’s not like that.

344
00:20:01,730 --> 00:20:04,562
No, it is like that, Lucas. It’s exactly like that!

345
00:20:05,514 --> 00:20:08,263
You realise I wouldn’t be in this situation if it wasn’t for you?

346
00:20:08,975 --> 00:20:11,990
If you would have stayed in your place at the Rivercourt, I would have never met Haley.

347
00:20:14,422 --> 00:20:15,974
You ruined my life, man.

348
00:20:16,531 --> 00:20:17,316
Nathan.

349
00:20:17,797 --> 00:20:19,046
You better watch your back.

350
00:20:33,466 --> 00:20:34,677
What did he want?

351
00:20:40,123 --> 00:20:41,015
Haley.

352
00:20:55,631 --> 00:20:57,524
Vote for Brooke! Get a make-over.

353
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:59,965
Let’s put a whole new face on Tree Hill High, people.

354
00:21:01,087 --> 00:21:01,818
Here you go.

355
00:21:04,152 --> 00:21:05,162
Damnit, Bevin!

356
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:10,405
What was that? Did Erica just convince you to vote for her?

357
00:21:10,595 --> 00:21:13,431
No, but… she made some good points.

358
00:21:13,491 --> 00:21:14,137
Bevin.

359
00:21:14,219 --> 00:21:16,151
She said that if you were elected president, that you wouldn’t have time

360
00:21:16,218 --> 00:21:20,234
for the cheerleading squad and you are… like the best captain ever.

361
00:21:20,321 --> 00:21:21,219
So?

362
00:21:21,358 --> 00:21:23,638
Brooke, the cheerleading squad needs you;

363
00:21:23,781 --> 00:21:26,031
so much more than America does.

364
00:21:26,353 --> 00:21:30,882
Bevin, you realise I’m not running for president of the United States, right?

365
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:39,942
Wow, make-over… booth looks very popular.

366
00:21:40,050 --> 00:21:44,632
Yeah, but it doesn’t matter because Erica is so much better at the dirty politicking than I am.

367
00:21:44,761 --> 00:21:46,553
Oh, come on, you can get dirty.

368
00:21:46,762 --> 00:21:47,511
Lucas!

369
00:21:48,667 --> 00:21:49,691
Don’t worry.

370
00:21:50,346 --> 00:21:51,165
You’ll be great.

371
00:21:51,904 --> 00:21:52,840
How do you know?

372
00:21:54,667 --> 00:21:55,877
Ah, it’s just a feeling.

373
00:21:58,222 --> 00:22:00,827
Time to wrap up the beauty-bar Miss. Davis.

374
00:22:01,211 --> 00:22:04,207
The Peer Endorsement Assembly starts in ten minutes.

375
00:22:04,765 --> 00:22:05,923
Will do, coach.

376
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:06,792
Wait!

377
00:22:07,422 --> 00:22:08,369
The what?

378
00:22:08,451 --> 00:22:09,423
Peer Endorsement.

379
00:22:09,751 --> 00:22:13,351
You know, where you introduce somebody who... speaks on your behalf.

380
00:22:14,084 --> 00:22:15,998
Oh, you didn’t forget, did you?

381
00:22:16,090 --> 00:22:18,927
It was in the schedule that Erica gave you!

382
00:22:20,450 --> 00:22:23,705
You’re gonna vote for me, right? Okay. That is so-

383
00:22:23,802 --> 00:22:26,319
Oh, it was, was it?

384
00:22:39,503 --> 00:22:40,743
It’s Andy, isn’t it?

385
00:22:41,148 --> 00:22:42,007
That’s right.

386
00:22:42,289 --> 00:22:43,240
What can I do for ya?

387
00:22:43,539 --> 00:22:45,275
Well, it’s a little awkward, actually.

388
00:22:47,788 --> 00:22:50,537
Kind of a favour, I guess you’d call it.

389
00:22:53,574 --> 00:22:54,367
Okay.

390
00:22:55,570 --> 00:22:56,789
Let Lucas go.

391
00:22:58,638 --> 00:22:59,887
It’s the right thing to do.

392
00:23:00,306 --> 00:23:01,438
And it needs to happen…

393
00:23:01,874 --> 00:23:02,740
now.

394
00:23:06,158 --> 00:23:07,792
You got some balls, kid.

395
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:10,772
But this is none of your concern.

396
00:23:10,854 --> 00:23:12,072
Was none of my concern,

397
00:23:12,539 --> 00:23:14,479
until you hurt the woman I love.

398
00:23:15,283 --> 00:23:17,816
Oh… it’s love is it?

399
00:23:18,251 --> 00:23:19,342
That’s right.

400
00:23:19,522 --> 00:23:20,935
Well, congratulations.

401
00:23:22,053 --> 00:23:23,736
Now get outta my dealership.

402
00:23:24,202 --> 00:23:25,733
Well, just so you know, mate,

403
00:23:27,191 --> 00:23:29,067
I do tend to get what I want.

404
00:23:35,066 --> 00:23:36,151
Is that so?

405
00:23:36,388 --> 00:23:38,712
Yeah. It’s the strangest thing;

406
00:23:39,567 --> 00:23:41,406
it just seems to happen that way.

407
00:23:58,158 --> 00:24:02,681
It was a thrill to be asked by Erica to be her peer advocate.

408
00:24:02,822 --> 00:24:05,320
Because, in addition to being her principle…

409
00:24:05,868 --> 00:24:08,151
I also consider myself her friend.

410
00:24:09,197 --> 00:24:11,609
Now, of course there’s a considerable age difference...

411
00:24:11,706 --> 00:24:13,345
That little bitch.

412
00:24:13,467 --> 00:24:16,974
Double-crosses me and gets the principle to be her peer advocate.

413
00:24:17,185 --> 00:24:17,978
Great.

414
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:20,641
...Erica is also a great friend to Tree Hill High.

415
00:24:20,681 --> 00:24:23,339
From organising food drives to raising money

416
00:24:23,410 --> 00:24:26,206
so our folk dancing team could travel to the regional finals-

417
00:24:26,257 --> 00:24:30,466
Hi. I’m gonna need you to do me a… little favour.

418
00:24:30,568 --> 00:24:33,983
And that’s why I encourage you to vote for this marvellous young lady…

419
00:24:34,085 --> 00:24:35,632
who wasn’t afraid to say;

420
00:24:35,837 --> 00:24:38,458
hey world, get a load of me.

421
00:24:39,139 --> 00:24:43,030
I’m proud to endorse, your president, Erica Marsh.

422
00:24:50,102 --> 00:24:51,765
Thank you, principle Turner.

423
00:24:53,251 --> 00:24:54,182
Now…

424
00:24:54,889 --> 00:24:57,187
to introduce her peer advocate;

425
00:24:57,504 --> 00:25:00,146
here is candidate, Brooke Davis.

426
00:25:08,602 --> 00:25:09,505
Hi.

427
00:25:10,018 --> 00:25:13,427
Due to an… unforeseen circumstance,

428
00:25:13,842 --> 00:25:16,618
I arrived today without anyone to speak for me.

429
00:25:16,956 --> 00:25:20,549
But… luckily, I had a volunteer, backstage.

430
00:25:20,749 --> 00:25:21,999
And that person…

431
00:25:22,137 --> 00:25:24,773
is Erica; the backstabbing sock puppet.

432
00:25:28,774 --> 00:25:32,884
Hi, I’m Erica. I sure do stink.

433
00:25:32,986 --> 00:25:36,027
And did you know that I have to cheat to win my elections, too?

434
00:25:36,156 --> 00:25:37,512
Oh, really?

435
00:25:43,129 --> 00:25:47,681
I appreciate the attempt, hun, but you’ve got to have an actual person.

436
00:25:47,768 --> 00:25:50,614
I know that but I don’t, because of Erica.

437
00:25:50,742 --> 00:25:51,967
I’ll speak for her.

438
00:26:01,204 --> 00:26:02,802
Do your thing, Mouth!

439
00:26:11,408 --> 00:26:14,934
We just heard principle Turner read a list of Erica’s accomplishments.

440
00:26:15,181 --> 00:26:18,852
I could try to do that for Brooke but it would be kind of a short speech.

441
00:26:24,447 --> 00:26:28,502
As you know, Brooke’s probably one of the most popular people in school.

442
00:26:29,486 --> 00:26:31,196
Something I’m definitely not…

443
00:26:32,215 --> 00:26:34,027
and yet, she’s my friend.

444
00:26:34,411 --> 00:26:36,828
She never cared what clique I was part of,

445
00:26:36,992 --> 00:26:38,928
the kinds of clothes I wore or…

446
00:26:39,123 --> 00:26:40,976
the fact that I have to ride the bus.

447
00:26:42,189 --> 00:26:44,028
She looked past that stuff.

448
00:26:45,169 --> 00:26:46,803
And when you think about it,

449
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:49,255
isn’t that what we want in our president,

450
00:26:49,992 --> 00:26:54,334
someone who can see past the superficial differences and bring us together?

451
00:26:57,601 --> 00:27:01,303
This year, Brooke’s had her share of ups and downs…

452
00:27:02,178 --> 00:27:03,510
just like all of us.

453
00:27:04,399 --> 00:27:06,202
But most of you never saw it,

454
00:27:06,530 --> 00:27:10,012
coz even when life got hard, Brooke never let it in.

455
00:27:11,077 --> 00:27:12,192
She was just…

456
00:27:13,271 --> 00:27:18,367
Brooke; tough, smart, one of a kind.

457
00:27:19,515 --> 00:27:22,750
And I don’t know about you but those are things that I look for in a leader.

458
00:27:27,159 --> 00:27:29,094
Brooke Davis is my friend.

459
00:27:30,614 --> 00:27:32,632
But that’s not why I’m voting for her.

460
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:35,944
I’m voting for her because of her heart…

461
00:27:36,063 --> 00:27:37,322
and her spirit…

462
00:27:38,233 --> 00:27:41,137
and because she’s the best person for the job.

463
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:13,978
You look pretty in that one.

464
00:28:15,462 --> 00:28:18,267
Votes are in, Erica. You can stop bagging on me now.

465
00:28:18,328 --> 00:28:20,541
I mean it. You look pretty.

466
00:28:20,679 --> 00:28:21,866
You always do.

467
00:28:23,623 --> 00:28:24,370
Thanks.

468
00:28:25,553 --> 00:28:26,894
What’re you still doing here?

469
00:28:27,258 --> 00:28:29,470
Just doing some work in the council office.

470
00:28:29,566 --> 00:28:31,437
Sometimes a job keeps you here late.

471
00:28:35,272 --> 00:28:38,978
Do you know why, every year, I have a faculty member speak on my behalf?

472
00:28:39,059 --> 00:28:41,332
Oh, I don’t know, maybe because you’re a hideous suck-up?

473
00:28:41,415 --> 00:28:45,599
Because I don’t have any friends that would speak up for me like Mouth did for you today.

474
00:28:46,468 --> 00:28:48,521
I mean, after all the great things he said,

475
00:28:48,936 --> 00:28:50,369
I almost voted for you.

476
00:28:52,028 --> 00:28:52,817
I didn’t.

477
00:28:54,426 --> 00:28:58,249
Please, Erica, you know a ton of people, I’m sure there’s someone.

478
00:28:58,665 --> 00:29:00,829
Council president is who I am.

479
00:29:01,413 --> 00:29:02,971
It’s all I am.

480
00:29:06,318 --> 00:29:07,174
Anyway…

481
00:29:07,974 --> 00:29:09,186
good luck tomorrow.

482
00:29:12,164 --> 00:29:13,066
Thanks.

483
00:29:29,701 --> 00:29:32,354
Looks like someone’s finally getting sleepy, huh?

484
00:29:37,107 --> 00:29:39,722
I guess we should try to grab some sleep while we can, huh?

485
00:29:40,306 --> 00:29:42,093
That’s probably a good idea.

486
00:29:44,205 --> 00:29:47,597
You know what, I’m gonna spend the night in my dad’s room tonight.

487
00:29:50,586 --> 00:29:51,585
Why tonight?

488
00:29:52,317 --> 00:29:53,775
Actually, from now on.

489
00:29:54,662 --> 00:29:56,056
What, is Jenny keeping you up?

490
00:29:56,235 --> 00:29:59,004
Yeah, it’s… not that. I’m just…

491
00:29:59,629 --> 00:30:00,832
really tired.

492
00:30:01,917 --> 00:30:04,594
You know what, this isn’t fair. We’ll go to my parents’ house, okay?

493
00:30:04,667 --> 00:30:05,727
No, don’t go.

494
00:30:06,899 --> 00:30:08,290
Really, it’s fine.

495
00:30:09,412 --> 00:30:11,071
Please stay. I…

496
00:30:14,308 --> 00:30:15,721
I’ll see you in the morning.

497
00:30:34,491 --> 00:30:35,340
Hey.

498
00:30:35,816 --> 00:30:39,047
What, you don’t call for… three days and then when you do it’s at...

499
00:30:39,645 --> 00:30:40,712
one in the morning?

500
00:30:40,804 --> 00:30:42,601
Oh, Luke, I’m sorry.

501
00:30:42,704 --> 00:30:46,026
I just finished my set. It’s crazy here, there’s so much to tell you.

502
00:30:46,252 --> 00:30:48,945
Yeah, wanna start with why you left without saying goodbye?

503
00:30:49,851 --> 00:30:52,100
Ah, yeah, I fell awful about that.

504
00:30:52,523 --> 00:30:55,304
Um… everything just happened so fast.

505
00:30:57,394 --> 00:30:58,447
How’s Nathan?

506
00:31:01,910 --> 00:31:03,600
He misses his wife!

507
00:31:04,095 --> 00:31:05,411
Lucas, don’t do this.

508
00:31:05,877 --> 00:31:06,854
Do what?!

509
00:31:07,664 --> 00:31:08,750
He needs you.

510
00:31:09,635 --> 00:31:11,438
He said that we were done.

511
00:31:11,995 --> 00:31:14,853
He didn’t want you to leave. He’s-

512
00:31:15,216 --> 00:31:17,167
He’s so in love with you, Hales.

513
00:31:18,995 --> 00:31:20,198
You gotta come back.

514
00:31:24,151 --> 00:31:25,958
Haley, Michelle wants to see you in her dressing room.

515
00:31:26,029 --> 00:31:26,778
Okay.

516
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:29,348
I gotta go.

517
00:31:31,119 --> 00:31:32,104
I’ll, um…


518
00:31:33,219 --> 00:31:34,754
I’ll call you later, okay?

519
00:31:50,273 --> 00:31:53,152
Good morning Ravens, The ballot has been counted; 

520
00:31:53,250 --> 00:31:57,166
the results from yesterday’s student council election are in.

521
00:31:59,228 --> 00:32:01,926
In the race for council treasurer,

522
00:32:02,290 --> 00:32:04,794
the winner is Vaughn Leiberwich.

523
00:32:06,232 --> 00:32:09,831
Council secretary; Tina Stone.

524
00:32:11,034 --> 00:32:15,437
Council vice president; Salmon Sakajahari.

525
00:32:16,324 --> 00:32:20,298
And finally, your new council president…

526
00:32:21,245 --> 00:32:22,621
Brooke Davis.

527
00:32:29,401 --> 00:32:30,122
Thank you!

528
00:33:11,239 --> 00:33:12,163
Erica.

529
00:33:13,182 --> 00:33:13,807
Hey.

530
00:33:14,309 --> 00:33:15,979
I was just… packing up.

531
00:33:19,405 --> 00:33:22,844
I’m sorry… about not giving you the campaign papers.

532
00:33:23,478 --> 00:33:25,226
I guess it worked out for you anyway, huh?

533
00:33:25,625 --> 00:33:26,524
I guess.

534
00:33:27,814 --> 00:33:30,206
Listen, I’ve been thinking about what you said yesterday,

535
00:33:30,832 --> 00:33:33,367
how being the president is all that you have.

536
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:36,082
Yeah…?

537
00:33:37,653 --> 00:33:40,657
Well it turns out that I have some experience in that arena.

538
00:33:41,255 --> 00:33:43,979
Trying to define yourself as just one thing.

539
00:33:46,468 --> 00:33:47,364
What d’you mean?

540
00:33:48,023 --> 00:33:49,781
I was always the rich girl.

541
00:33:50,006 --> 00:33:52,925
You know, with the nice car and the expensive shoes

542
00:33:52,986 --> 00:33:54,783
and the fancy house with the pool.

543
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:58,238
So when my parents lost their money…

544
00:33:59,033 --> 00:34:01,951
figured my identity would disappear with it.

545
00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:04,777
You mean, you’re not rich?

546
00:34:05,859 --> 00:34:07,557
Eighteen bucks at Bargain Mart;

547
00:34:07,681 --> 00:34:09,478
my heels are practically bleeding.

548
00:34:12,441 --> 00:34:14,813
I’m just saying, high school is not over.

549
00:34:15,017 --> 00:34:19,784
You know, there’s other things to look forward to. There’s friends and guys.

550
00:34:19,865 --> 00:34:21,837
And… the guys.

551
00:34:29,288 --> 00:34:31,242
There’s a proposal in the top drawer;

552
00:34:31,376 --> 00:34:33,455
wireless internet for the cafeteria.

553
00:34:33,752 --> 00:34:34,864
I think it’d be great.

554
00:34:36,414 --> 00:34:37,438
Thanks.

555
00:34:41,162 --> 00:34:42,549
To tell you the truth,

556
00:34:43,793 --> 00:34:46,132
I’m totally intimidated by this job.

557
00:34:48,503 --> 00:34:49,476
It’s funny…

558
00:34:50,336 --> 00:34:51,816
you’re scared of what’s in here,

559
00:34:52,558 --> 00:34:54,099
I’m scared of what’s out there.

560
00:35:07,155 --> 00:35:08,451
You thinking about Lucas?

561
00:35:10,313 --> 00:35:11,246
What else?

562
00:35:14,522 --> 00:35:16,546
I’ve been thinking about what I can do to help you.

563
00:35:18,537 --> 00:35:19,761
That’s sweet, Andy.

564
00:35:21,215 --> 00:35:22,890
But I’ve looked at every angle…

565
00:35:24,031 --> 00:35:26,684
I’m gonna have to go through the courts. There’s no other way.

566
00:35:31,256 --> 00:35:32,268
Actually…

567
00:35:33,959 --> 00:35:35,141
there is another way.

568
00:35:41,572 --> 00:35:42,309
Hey.

569
00:35:42,976 --> 00:35:43,728
Hey.

570
00:35:44,030 --> 00:35:45,361
Sorry, the crying keeping you up?

571
00:35:45,853 --> 00:35:46,836
No.

572
00:35:48,448 --> 00:35:49,954
It’s okay. It’s okay.

573
00:35:56,259 --> 00:35:57,187
You know…

574
00:35:59,182 --> 00:36:01,401
I wasn’t entirely honest with you, before.

575
00:36:02,335 --> 00:36:03,262
About what?

576
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:06,040
The reason I came back.

577
00:36:08,212 --> 00:36:10,060
You said you were tired of running.

578
00:36:11,049 --> 00:36:12,625
Yeah, but…

579
00:36:13,113 --> 00:36:15,072
that’s not the only reason.

580
00:36:16,506 --> 00:36:18,651
See, the whole time that I was gone, I kept thinking

581
00:36:18,708 --> 00:36:21,355
about all this stuff that I should have done…

582
00:36:21,769 --> 00:36:23,669
when I had the chance, but didn’t.

583
00:36:25,573 --> 00:36:27,228
Well, like what kinda stuff?

584
00:36:30,545 --> 00:36:31,651
I don’t know.

585
00:36:34,908 --> 00:36:36,546
Mostly being with you.

586
00:37:00,785 --> 00:37:01,630
Wow.

587
00:37:02,096 --> 00:37:02,849
Yeah.

588
00:37:03,059 --> 00:37:03,678
No.

589
00:37:04,153 --> 00:37:06,177
No-yeah-I mean, that too…

590
00:37:07,149 --> 00:37:09,863
Jenny. She stopped crying.

591
00:37:33,003 --> 00:37:34,135
Nathan.

592
00:37:35,992 --> 00:37:38,217
Ms. Roe. What’re you doing here?

593
00:37:40,359 --> 00:37:41,499
Looking for Lucas.

594
00:37:43,189 --> 00:37:44,475
Why would Lucas be here?

595
00:37:45,167 --> 00:37:47,511
He’s got his own court in Dan Scott’s driveway.

596
00:38:04,534 --> 00:38:05,625
Ms. Roe,

597
00:38:07,053 --> 00:38:09,061
I’m sorry my dad was such a dick to you.

598
00:38:11,705 --> 00:38:13,827
I haven’t really thought about it much until lately.

599
00:38:16,090 --> 00:38:18,098
I know that it must have really hurt you.

600
00:38:19,782 --> 00:38:20,892
I got over it.

601
00:38:25,419 --> 00:38:27,124
When Haley told me about the tour…

602
00:38:29,707 --> 00:38:30,806
I got mad at her.

603
00:38:32,151 --> 00:38:33,847
I told her that if she left with Chris,

604
00:38:35,535 --> 00:38:36,447
it was over.

605
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:41,998
I didn’t really mean it.

606
00:38:44,535 --> 00:38:45,838
She left anyway.

607
00:38:47,414 --> 00:38:48,561
Nathan.

608
00:38:49,985 --> 00:38:51,316
She’s not coming back.

609
00:38:54,809 --> 00:38:56,124
What am I gonna do?

610
00:38:58,422 --> 00:38:59,436
Nathan,

611
00:39:01,893 --> 00:39:05,300
I know what it’s like to have the person you love walk away.

612
00:39:05,372 --> 00:39:06,307
Trust me.

613
00:39:07,875 --> 00:39:10,675
But I know Haley and she’s a good person.

614
00:39:11,811 --> 00:39:13,219
She’ll do the right thing.

615
00:39:17,229 --> 00:39:19,097
You just have to have a little faith.

616
00:39:35,776 --> 00:39:37,883
Bob? It’s Andy.

617
00:39:38,517 --> 00:39:39,804
I’ve got a job for you.

618
00:39:45,330 --> 00:39:46,488
‘Call of the Wild’.

619
00:39:47,319 --> 00:39:48,794
You know, I’ve had that since high school?

620
00:39:49,989 --> 00:39:51,820
I hope it’s okay that I borrowed it.

621
00:39:52,219 --> 00:39:55,891
Please, it’s nice to have someone around who cares about literature.

622
00:39:58,142 --> 00:39:59,418
London’s great;

623
00:39:59,807 --> 00:40:00,836
a man’s author.

624
00:40:02,005 --> 00:40:03,208
Kill or be killed.

625
00:40:04,098 --> 00:40:05,255
It’s the way of the world.

626
00:40:06,735 --> 00:40:07,630
You know…

627
00:40:08,801 --> 00:40:11,506
if you ever need any help down at the dealership,

628
00:40:11,557 --> 00:40:13,728
I could come by after school sometime.

629
00:40:16,242 --> 00:40:17,185
Thanks, son.

630
00:40:17,860 --> 00:40:18,807
I’d like that.

631
00:40:27,908 --> 00:40:28,715
Hey, Mouth.

632
00:40:30,041 --> 00:40:31,147
Miss. President.

633
00:40:31,443 --> 00:40:33,727
I know, it does have a nice ring to it, doesn’t it?

634
00:40:34,163 --> 00:40:35,017
But, you know what?

635
00:40:35,898 --> 00:40:37,538
My friends just call me Brooke.

636
00:42:03,596 --> 00:42:05,802
Hi, this is Haley; I can’t get to the phone right now.

637
00:42:05,868 --> 00:42:07,951
Leave a message and I will call you back.
