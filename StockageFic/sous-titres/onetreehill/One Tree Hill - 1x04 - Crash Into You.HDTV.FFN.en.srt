1
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:39,486
Mom!

2
00:01:42,518 --> 00:01:44,080
Mom, did you forget to pay the water bill?

3
00:01:44,177 --> 00:01:46,306
No, of course I paid the water bill.

4
00:01:49,404 --> 00:01:53,501
See? This is what we need the emergency Visa for. Something must’ve broken.

5
00:01:53,604 --> 00:01:55,886
I’ll take care of it. Come on, lets get you rinsed.

6
00:02:01,365 --> 00:02:02,967
How is this funny, Mom?

7
00:02:03,095 --> 00:02:04,893
How is this not funny?

8
00:02:10,038 --> 00:02:13,437
Hey. Check it out. It’s called ‘dinner.’

9
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:16,003
Who is that lady? Is that my wife?

10
00:02:17,719 --> 00:02:19,433
I didn’t think you were getting back until Monday.

11
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:23,980
I wasn’t. Until I sweet talked Ziodex into doubling their ‘Gift to AIDS’ research.

12
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:26,320
It took me all of one meeting.

13
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:28,160
Wow, I’m impressed.

14
00:02:29,454 --> 00:02:32,159
You sure you don’t want to quit saving the world and come sell cars with me?

15
00:02:32,637 --> 00:02:34,845
Mmm, thanks, but I like the Frequent Flyer miles.

16
00:02:36,329 --> 00:02:38,219
Hey. How’s my boy?

17
00:02:38,664 --> 00:02:41,122
- I have warm-ups, Mom.
- Oh, come on, sit.

18
00:02:41,388 --> 00:02:43,897
Dinner’s almost ready and I haven’t seen you from weeks.

19
00:02:43,979 --> 00:02:46,185
I can’t. I got to go. Don’t wait up.

20
00:02:46,467 --> 00:02:48,321
Nathan. Remember what I told you.

21
00:02:49,371 --> 00:02:51,091
He can’t shoot if he doesn’t have the ball.

22
00:02:53,263 --> 00:02:57,629
Damnit, this is a team, not a Chinese fire grill.

23
00:02:57,787 --> 00:03:02,088
Scott, you’re plain selfish. Get out there and pretend you know each other.

24
00:03:02,529 --> 00:03:06,701
- All right, lets try to get it together. 
- Ravens on three. One! Two! Three! Ravens!

25
00:03:08,022 --> 00:03:09,395
Lets go, lets go, lets go!

26
00:03:09,477 --> 00:03:11,422
Hey, can I catch a ride with you to Nathan’s party later.

27
00:03:11,513 --> 00:03:12,590
I didn’t think you were going.

28
00:03:12,836 --> 00:03:15,120
I figured you’d be hiding out in Lucas’ back seat again.

29
00:03:15,212 --> 00:03:16,404
- Jealous.
- No.

30
00:03:16,644 --> 00:03:21,969
What? I could see it. You’re both so broody. You could brood together.

31
00:03:24,049 --> 00:03:26,500
Now the Ravens in bound with the ball.

32
00:03:26,577 --> 00:03:30,126
Looks like they’re trying to isolate Nathan Scott on the baseline.

33
00:03:30,309 --> 00:03:33,254
The Masenberg defense tightens on him. Scott battles through,

34
00:03:33,305 --> 00:03:37,329
still working hard to get open down there. Now Tim Smith, with the ball,

35
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:41,113
working over on the wing. He’s dribbling, looking for Nathan underneath,

36
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:43,868
but he’s not there. And now- Oh! Oh!

37
00:03:43,955 --> 00:03:47,688
A cross court pass putting Lucas Scott over the basket.

38
00:03:47,861 --> 00:03:52,403
So much for the putty grip on that one as the Ravens fall back on the bench.

39
00:03:52,454 --> 00:03:57,277
And I tell you what, Lucas Scott is really starting to gel with this team.

40
00:03:59,761 --> 00:04:02,207
He had a better angle. I’m sorry.

41
00:04:03,073 --> 00:04:06,217
Nathan, come on, Man. I’m just trying to win.

42
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:08,971
So are you excited?

43
00:04:09,698 --> 00:04:10,912
What? That we won?

44
00:04:10,978 --> 00:04:14,886
No, because there’s running water in the locker room. We’re gonna be roughing it until tomorrow.

45
00:04:15,561 --> 00:04:16,387
It’s okay...

46
00:04:18,408 --> 00:04:19,058
What’s up, Dad?

47
00:04:27,061 --> 00:04:28,166
Nice game, sweetie.

48
00:04:28,556 --> 00:04:29,739
Try telling that to Dad.

49
00:04:35,881 --> 00:04:37,746
Two decent games in a row, man.

50
00:04:38,402 --> 00:04:39,650
Getting better or just lucky?

51
00:04:43,005 --> 00:04:45,457
Team’s got a party tonight. My parents’ beach house.

52
00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:46,445
Why are you tell me that?

53
00:04:47,152 --> 00:04:48,473
Because I said the team, didn’t I?

54
00:04:51,284 --> 00:04:55,979
Look, it’s kind of the off season. Might as well deal with it.

55
00:05:46,143 --> 00:05:50,620
The guys kidnapped you, trashed your court, threatened you with bodily harm.

56
00:05:51,347 --> 00:05:53,938
Party, yeah. Sure, why not?

57
00:05:54,035 --> 00:05:56,124
Okay, listen, I know it’s all a setup, alright?

58
00:05:56,901 --> 00:05:59,447
But I’m not gonna let him screw with me. Whatever he dishes out he’s going to get back double.

59
00:06:01,709 --> 00:06:07,054
Do you think maybe- I mean, just maybe- he’s had a change of heart?

60
00:06:07,291 --> 00:06:09,549
Hmm. That requires a heart.

61
00:06:18,832 --> 00:06:22,062
Every time I ride with you, I swear I’m never going to do it again.

62
00:06:27,117 --> 00:06:27,905
Keys?

63
00:06:28,918 --> 00:06:29,926
Tempt fate.

64
00:06:30,346 --> 00:06:34,406
Peyton. You’ve got to talk to him. Lucas had the better shot. You saw it, right?

65
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:37,028
Tim? Are you being pathetic?

66
00:06:41,255 --> 00:06:42,357
What’s he doing here?

67
00:06:43,346 --> 00:06:46,454
I invited him. I mean, since you guys are such great friends now.

68
00:06:48,789 --> 00:06:49,744
What are you trying to pull?

69
00:06:50,551 --> 00:06:51,574
Nothing.

70
00:06:59,915 --> 00:07:00,765
I wasn’t sure you’d come.

71
00:07:01,978 --> 00:07:02,972
That makes two of us.

72
00:07:03,637 --> 00:07:05,199
Hi. I’m Nathan Scott.

73
00:07:05,665 --> 00:07:07,309
Um, yeah, I know, I’m Haley.

74
00:07:18,162 --> 00:07:19,725
Tonight’s gonna be great.

75
00:07:30,042 --> 00:07:32,945
Well. I bet their plumbing works.

76
00:07:34,016 --> 00:07:35,209
I’m just saying...

77
00:07:35,716 --> 00:07:36,728
- Alright, thanks.
- Yeah.

78
00:07:36,979 --> 00:07:38,241
Have you guy’s seen this?

79
00:07:40,129 --> 00:07:42,837
The High School Fearleader. It’s a comic strip.

80
00:07:45,147 --> 00:07:46,595
Wait, this is insulting, right?

81
00:07:47,782 --> 00:07:49,242
My dog can draw better than this.

82
00:07:50,502 --> 00:07:52,744
Really, what guy keeps his hat on during sex?

83
00:07:54,397 --> 00:07:56,180
Who is this socky person anyway?

84
00:07:57,853 --> 00:07:58,908
Yeah, I wonder.

85
00:08:00,802 --> 00:08:03,644
It’s just a stupid comic strip. Who cares, right?

86
00:08:03,799 --> 00:08:06,999
It’s more like sucky. Whoever it is doesn’t know the first thing about it.

87
00:08:07,254 --> 00:08:09,323
- It’s like so... 
- Shallow?

88
00:08:13,772 --> 00:08:14,770
Where’s the keg?

89
00:08:21,376 --> 00:08:22,031
You okay?

90
00:08:26,358 --> 00:08:28,892
He used to ask me before he put stuff up.

91
00:08:29,725 --> 00:08:32,060
Now... I don’t even know what he’s interested in.

92
00:08:33,185 --> 00:08:35,656
- Besides basketball.
- Basketball.

93
00:08:37,739 --> 00:08:40,377
Yeah, seems like it changes from day to day.

94
00:08:44,754 --> 00:08:46,295
He talks to you, Dan.

95
00:08:47,411 --> 00:08:48,512
How’s he been doing?

96
00:08:50,496 --> 00:08:53,965
Well, he’s holding up considering Whitey’s moved him out of his position, but

97
00:08:54,114 --> 00:08:58,133
- it’s probably temporary.
- I asked you how he is, not how he’s playing.

98
00:09:00,662 --> 00:09:05,940
It must be confusing for him with Lucas on the team now.

99
00:09:08,768 --> 00:09:10,370
Were we going to talk about that?

100
00:09:11,245 --> 00:09:14,799
-  I think that’s probably temporary too.
- You think or you wish?

101
00:09:19,601 --> 00:09:22,683
I saw Karen at the game tonight,

102
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:27,286
- but then... I’ve never really spoken to her.
- I know this is hard on you, Deb.

103
00:09:27,364 --> 00:09:30,953
No, not really. I think it’s harder for you and Nathan.

104
00:09:36,462 --> 00:09:39,267
So, I know you’re like, having the time of your life,

105
00:09:39,313 --> 00:09:41,689
but can we please make like a tree and get out of here?

106
00:09:42,079 --> 00:09:42,989
We just got here.

107
00:09:43,762 --> 00:09:46,077
Whatever. You let me know when you’ve proved your point.

108
00:09:46,102 --> 00:09:48,488
I’m going to go to one of the eighteen bathrooms in this place.

109
00:09:49,339 --> 00:09:50,573
- Gonna be back in five?
- Yeah.

110
00:09:50,665 --> 00:09:51,345
A lright

111
00:09:51,566 --> 00:09:53,558
- Hey, good game, man.
- Hey, thanks.

112
00:09:58,904 --> 00:10:02,051
Lucas. Come play.

113
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,246
- What’s the game?
- I never...

114
00:10:07,222 --> 00:10:10,202
- And yet apparently you have.
- Shut up, Vegas.

115
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:15,102
Alright. So the game is, we all take turns saying things that we’ve never done,

116
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:17,620
and anybody at the table who has... 

117
00:10:17,722 --> 00:10:19,127
Bam! Drinks.

118
00:10:20,412 --> 00:10:21,277
Yeah.

119
00:10:23,419 --> 00:10:25,511
Alright, Theresa, you’re up.

120
00:10:25,691 --> 00:10:27,309
Okay. Lets see.

121
00:10:28,349 --> 00:10:33,181
I’ve never... had sex with anything made out of plastic.

122
00:10:37,247 --> 00:10:38,439
Okay, my turn.

123
00:10:39,064 --> 00:10:44,097
I’ve never... no I did that, um...

124
00:10:45,045 --> 00:10:46,765
Alright. My turn.

125
00:10:47,477 --> 00:10:49,923
Oh, lets see. Um...

126
00:10:50,339 --> 00:10:51,548
I’ve never...

127
00:10:53,262 --> 00:10:56,180
I’ve never had a dad who wished I was a stain on the bed sheets.

128
00:11:11,812 --> 00:11:13,439
Then you’re welcome to mine.

129
00:11:25,004 --> 00:11:26,108
Hang on a minute.

130
00:11:32,979 --> 00:11:33,659
Sorry.

131
00:11:34,443 --> 00:11:35,692
How’s the tutoring going?

132
00:11:38,319 --> 00:11:39,661
You’re tutoring Nathan, right?

133
00:11:40,996 --> 00:11:42,610
It’s okay. He tells me everything.

134
00:11:42,834 --> 00:11:45,420
Yeah. You know, he said he needed some help.

135
00:11:46,588 --> 00:11:48,605
Maybe you could teach him to stop being such a jackass.

136
00:11:48,819 --> 00:11:50,464
I will put that on my lesson plan.

137
00:11:54,417 --> 00:11:55,666
Just be careful, okay.

138
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,853
Yeah... sure.

139
00:12:01,461 --> 00:12:03,309
Does Lucas know you’re helping Nathan?

140
00:12:05,931 --> 00:12:06,673
You know...

141
00:12:11,004 --> 00:12:13,257
you say a lot when you keep your mouth shut.

142
00:12:13,948 --> 00:12:14,902
- I’m... 
- It's okay.

143
00:12:16,438 --> 00:12:17,743
I keep mine shut too.

144
00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:36,440
- What happened?
- Oh, same old crap.

145
00:12:36,510 --> 00:12:38,950
You know, he thinks that if he keeps hammering me, I’ll quit the team.

146
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:40,640
Oh. What did he do this time?

147
00:12:41,131 --> 00:12:42,873
He made some feeble comment.

148
00:12:45,222 --> 00:12:48,356
- Not gonna let it get to me.
- Yeah, obviously that’s working out for you.

149
00:12:50,527 --> 00:12:54,197
Luke... have you guys ever actually talked?

150
00:12:54,258 --> 00:12:56,620
Yeah, sure. We trade emails too.

151
00:12:56,722 --> 00:13:00,204
I’m saying you’re so hypersensitive around each other.

152
00:13:00,536 --> 00:13:03,455
And... I get it. I just think that...

153
00:13:04,702 --> 00:13:08,364
maybe everything he says, you take the wrong way, and vice versa.

154
00:13:10,209 --> 00:13:12,430
Okay, there is no misunderstanding what he said.

155
00:13:13,332 --> 00:13:17,213
- And why are you defending him?
- I’m just, I’m trying to bring some perspective.

156
00:13:17,290 --> 00:13:21,421
I mean... It’s a really screwing situation and I’m sure having you around

157
00:13:21,493 --> 00:13:23,623
isn’t any easier for him than it is for you and I think

158
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:27,161
- maybe if you guys could just talk... 
- Tell me that I’m not hearing this.

159
00:13:28,926 --> 00:13:30,407
Then what are you doing here, Lucas?

160
00:13:31,779 --> 00:13:33,822
Obviously, you’re looking for something, right?

161
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:36,971
I’m not going to let him win.

162
00:13:39,894 --> 00:13:44,457
Fine. Don’t let him win. I’m gonna go home.

163
00:13:45,169 --> 00:13:46,473
- Haley!
- Nope.

164
00:13:51,276 --> 00:13:52,298
Are you leaving?

165
00:13:52,965 --> 00:13:56,545
Nathan... we had a deal. You promised you were gonna be nice.

166
00:13:56,734 --> 00:13:59,668
I am nice. I invited him to this stinking party, didn’t I?

167
00:14:00,108 --> 00:14:02,740
Well, what for? So you could pick on him in public?

168
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:06,919
- What did you say anyway?
- Oh, man. Is that what...

169
00:14:08,146 --> 00:14:13,405
I made a lame joke. I mean, look, the guys... sometimes we get kind of raw with each other.

170
00:14:13,466 --> 00:14:15,655
I was just trying to include him. He took it the wrong way.

171
00:14:15,771 --> 00:14:17,609
Well, maybe you need to rethink your approach.

172
00:14:17,679 --> 00:14:21,382
- Well, you’re his friend. How do I handle this?
- It’s easy, stop being such a...

173
00:14:22,182 --> 00:14:22,985
jerk.

174
00:14:38,815 --> 00:14:40,113
He really slammed you.

175
00:14:40,409 --> 00:14:42,047
I don’t care what he thinks.

176
00:14:43,014 --> 00:14:44,141
Neither do I.

177
00:14:45,749 --> 00:14:46,546
Oh yeah?

178
00:14:48,822 --> 00:14:49,983
Then why are you drinking?

179
00:15:12,992 --> 00:15:16,075
Nathan! I can’t believe your parents don’t have any decent porn.

180
00:15:19,858 --> 00:15:20,975
Wait.

181
00:15:23,472 --> 00:15:24,538
I’ve got something.

182
00:15:32,515 --> 00:15:33,148
Put that in.

183
00:15:33,881 --> 00:15:34,573
What is it?

184
00:15:35,336 --> 00:15:36,104
It’s a comedy.

185
00:15:40,264 --> 00:15:43,119
So I’m confused. You want to be anonymous...

186
00:15:43,722 --> 00:15:45,745
and you let the world watch you on a web cam.

187
00:15:46,124 --> 00:15:49,944
The world isn’t watching me... but I guess you are.

188
00:15:51,162 --> 00:15:52,508
Okay, the point is...

189
00:15:53,625 --> 00:15:56,498
you want to express yourself but you don’t want people to know it’s you.

190
00:15:57,122 --> 00:16:00,573
I guess I’m just a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside a bitch.

191
00:16:00,711 --> 00:16:02,303
Or maybe just a tortured artist.

192
00:16:03,169 --> 00:16:05,657
Look, I don’t need you defending me and my work.

193
00:16:06,092 --> 00:16:09,374
I don’t need you analyzing it or interpreting me either.

194
00:16:09,431 --> 00:16:12,989
And in fact, I’m pretty sure I don’t need you at all.

195
00:16:13,507 --> 00:16:14,519
Pretty sure?

196
00:16:15,139 --> 00:16:19,825
Tree Hill High’s Snowball Court King and Queen, Daniel Scott and Karen Roe.

197
00:16:19,912 --> 00:16:21,985
Karen, what’s the secret to your success?

198
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:26,593
Um, the secret to our success. Hmm. I don’t know.

199
00:16:26,695 --> 00:16:28,646
Good question. Dan?

200
00:16:30,309 --> 00:16:33,970
-  Good sex!
- Be serious.

201
00:16:34,181 --> 00:16:36,587
Karen, do you think you guys will get married?

202
00:16:36,691 --> 00:16:41,006
Do I think Dan and I will get married? Hmm... who knows. I mean...

203
00:16:41,498 --> 00:16:43,034
Oh my god, the hair!

204
00:16:44,757 --> 00:16:50,221
But he really is the sweetest guy in the whole world. So I’m thinking, yes.

205
00:16:50,944 --> 00:16:54,016
Come visit us in 10 years and I bet you can meet the kids

206
00:16:54,110 --> 00:16:58,004
and get a tour of our big house and see how happy we are.

207
00:16:59,291 --> 00:17:01,722
- Who’s the girl?
- Okay ladies and gentleman,

208
00:17:01,810 --> 00:17:05,276
- That’s my mom.
- At least their dreams came true for one of them, right?

209
00:17:05,373 --> 00:17:07,032
Yeah, except for the happy part, right?

210
00:17:36,924 --> 00:17:37,881
I thought you left.

211
00:17:39,326 --> 00:17:43,190
Yeah, I tried to. If the stupid cab would ever get here.

212
00:17:43,565 --> 00:17:44,731
Well, I’m glad you stayed.

213
00:17:46,227 --> 00:17:48,136
I want to thank you for holding back?

214
00:17:48,986 --> 00:17:52,012
- What do you mean?
- Jerk is pretty tame.

215
00:17:52,996 --> 00:17:54,525
You could’ve called me a lot worse.

216
00:17:55,790 --> 00:17:56,947
I probably deserved it.

217
00:17:59,339 --> 00:18:02,417
Look, I’ve been thinking a lot about this tutoring thing.

218
00:18:04,003 --> 00:18:06,820
I’m sorry. I just don’t think it’s a good idea.

219
00:18:07,654 --> 00:18:10,834
- Because of Lucas? 
- Well, obviously, yeah.

220
00:18:11,658 --> 00:18:14,725
I don’t know what I was thinking. There’s no good that can possibly come of this.

221
00:18:15,088 --> 00:18:15,799
Really?

222
00:18:16,798 --> 00:18:18,615
I thought I saw you guys fight back there.

223
00:18:19,328 --> 00:18:22,139
Meaning what, that I should keep tutoring you to stick it to him?

224
00:18:22,656 --> 00:18:26,773
Maybe that’s how they do things in Nathan land, but I’m not going to do that to my best friend.

225
00:18:28,959 --> 00:18:30,545
Maybe you’re doing me a favor then.

226
00:18:31,832 --> 00:18:32,731
What does that mean?

227
00:18:34,431 --> 00:18:37,238
Sometimes I think it would be easier if I got kicked off the team.

228
00:18:38,979 --> 00:18:40,438
Especially with my dad.

229
00:18:46,105 --> 00:18:50,863
I should go find Lucas, and just try and smooth things over.

230
00:18:51,026 --> 00:18:52,578
He left a while ago.

231
00:18:54,773 --> 00:18:56,889
Great. Well, I guess I’m walking.

232
00:19:01,021 --> 00:19:03,180
- Let me give you a ride.
- It’s not that far.

233
00:19:03,318 --> 00:19:06,012
Forget it, you’re not going to walk. We’ll take Peyton’s car.

234
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:09,232
I’m really fine.

235
00:19:10,159 --> 00:19:11,987
You’re a little high on yourself, aren’t you?

236
00:19:12,263 --> 00:19:14,015
Going around telling people you’re all fine.

237
00:19:15,895 --> 00:19:19,290
Look, please, juste take the ride. It’s the least I can do.

238
00:19:29,413 --> 00:19:31,381
Dan. We should talk.

239
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:42,416
You know, I try to let these things roll off my back. You shut down and walk out mid-conversation.

240
00:19:42,488 --> 00:19:45,647
I swallow it and let it churn around in my stomach until it makes me sick.

241
00:19:45,775 --> 00:19:48,923
What? Because I don’t want to rehash Karen and her son for the ten-thousandth time?

242
00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:51,115
- Frankly, I’m talked out.
- It’s about Nathan.

243
00:19:51,257 --> 00:19:55,416
- What about him?
- He’s just so surly and distant lately

244
00:19:55,554 --> 00:19:58,354
and I fell powerless to do anything about it.

245
00:19:58,785 --> 00:20:02,794
And the way you’re pressuring him since Lucas joined the team seems to make it worse.

246
00:20:02,942 --> 00:20:03,583
Me?

247
00:20:05,067 --> 00:20:07,631
Did you ever stop to think the problem was you?

248
00:20:07,821 --> 00:20:09,844
Maybe if you cared to spend more time at home.

249
00:20:09,961 --> 00:20:12,819
I’m gone ten days out of the month, tops.

250
00:20:12,910 --> 00:20:14,709
And when you are here, you work ‘til all hours.

251
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:17,411
And you want to know why, Dan? Let me tell you.

252
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:20,012
Because ever since you started this basketball thing,

253
00:20:20,119 --> 00:20:23,868
I feel like you’ve slowly been stealing him from me.

254
00:20:24,626 --> 00:20:26,714
You’ve made me feel irrelevant.

255
00:20:26,956 --> 00:20:30,697
I go out and I raise money for good causes and I matter out there.

256
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:35,455
- But at home you shut me out of his life.
- Shut you out?

257
00:20:35,684 --> 00:20:38,485
- Work has always come first with you?
- That is not fair.

258
00:20:38,710 --> 00:20:41,077
You know how hard I’ve tried to balance both.

259
00:20:42,556 --> 00:20:46,979
But, I swear to God, I never would’ve done it if I knew how he’d turn out.

260
00:20:47,077 --> 00:20:50,131
- He’s a good kid.
- Based on what? His scoring average?

261
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:57,865
Deb, I just want what’s best for our son, what makes him happy.

262
00:20:57,972 --> 00:20:59,790
Well, then, something’s not working, Dan.

263
00:21:00,231 --> 00:21:04,392
Because that kid I saw tonight is anything but happy.

264
00:21:18,524 --> 00:21:20,853
Don’t let me have another beer unless I beg you.

265
00:21:21,376 --> 00:21:22,722
The same goes for boys.

266
00:21:24,166 --> 00:21:27,426
- What are you doing?
- Just wondering if we’re all going to end up like Karen.

267
00:21:29,007 --> 00:21:32,676
- Who is Karen?
- That’s Lucas’ mom

268
00:21:34,751 --> 00:21:37,083
Not without proper birth control we won’t.

269
00:21:38,056 --> 00:21:39,168
That’s not what I meant.

270
00:21:40,878 --> 00:21:43,183
She was our age when that tape was made, Brooke.

271
00:21:44,426 --> 00:21:46,192
We’re just like her.

272
00:21:48,205 --> 00:21:51,425
Don’t you think it was awful how she just let Nathan’s dad treat her like crap?

273
00:21:51,527 --> 00:21:55,051
Yeah. But honey, that doesn’t mean we’re like her.

274
00:21:56,367 --> 00:21:59,270
Maybe it mean’s you’re like her.

275
00:22:15,449 --> 00:22:19,607
Yeah, this is my house. We’re staying here while we renovate the mansion

276
00:22:20,604 --> 00:22:23,523
- It’s not like I was trying to show off.
- Isn’t that your default setting.

277
00:22:24,775 --> 00:22:25,367
Sorry.

278
00:22:28,577 --> 00:22:29,667
Can I be honest with you?

279
00:22:31,474 --> 00:22:33,794
Yeah. I don’t know. You tell me.

280
00:22:35,910 --> 00:22:38,981
What I said at the beach... that was a lie.

281
00:22:42,918 --> 00:22:44,731
I’m really lucky to have basketball.

282
00:22:46,086 --> 00:22:48,535
It’s pretty much my shell to everything from here on out.

283
00:22:49,682 --> 00:22:52,258
If I lose it, it’s over for me.

284
00:22:53,625 --> 00:22:57,086
- So, don’t lose it.
- Well, that’s just the thing.

285
00:22:58,181 --> 00:23:03,368
With my grades, I’m close to being ineligible to do the one thing that I’m actually good at.

286
00:23:04,746 --> 00:23:07,244
It’s not just my life, either. It’s my dad’s, too.

287
00:23:08,632 --> 00:23:10,710
It’s like he’s still got something to prove to Whitey.

288
00:23:12,839 --> 00:23:15,610
And if I screw it up, it’s gonna destroy him.

289
00:23:18,907 --> 00:23:20,346
And it will destroy me.

290
00:23:22,707 --> 00:23:25,420
Look, I know you have no reason to do this,

291
00:23:25,575 --> 00:23:28,277
and I know it’s just going to complicate things with Lucas, but...

292
00:23:29,593 --> 00:23:31,191
I really need your help.

293
00:23:31,805 --> 00:23:34,488
And I will find you someone else. I promise.

294
00:23:34,631 --> 00:23:35,353
No.

295
00:23:37,144 --> 00:23:39,746
I came to you because you’re the best tutor at the school.

296
00:23:41,072 --> 00:23:42,695
And you’re not going to tear me down.

297
00:23:44,309 --> 00:23:47,289
It’s not exactly easy having everybody know you’re failing.

298
00:23:51,527 --> 00:23:53,006
It’s you or nobody else.

299
00:23:56,479 --> 00:23:57,226
I...

300
00:24:02,391 --> 00:24:03,733
Okay.  I will...

301
00:24:06,263 --> 00:24:07,932
I will get you through the semester.

302
00:24:09,447 --> 00:24:12,181
And then you’ve got to be on your own. I’m serious.

303
00:24:12,693 --> 00:24:14,926
- That’s totally fine with me.
- Okay...

304
00:24:17,005 --> 00:24:18,408
Great, so we’ll start on Monday.

305
00:24:20,062 --> 00:24:21,346
Lay off Lucas.

306
00:25:17,892 --> 00:25:20,333
Peyton! You okay?

307
00:25:22,649 --> 00:25:25,721
Yeah, she’s fine. Can’t say the same for her car though.

308
00:25:30,729 --> 00:25:33,038
And what the hell were you doing following my girlfriend?

309
00:25:33,175 --> 00:25:33,821
I wasn’t.

310
00:25:34,814 --> 00:25:36,868
Look, I thought she was driving and she was drinking.

311
00:25:38,117 --> 00:25:39,227
Hey, where are you going?

312
00:25:40,841 --> 00:25:42,151
Back to the party, dumbass.

313
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:43,558
What, are you gonna leave her car like this?

314
00:25:43,815 --> 00:25:46,251
Yeah, and if you stand there you can watch me.

315
00:25:47,056 --> 00:25:49,160
- You know this is a crime.
- So call the cops.

316
00:25:49,938 --> 00:25:52,310
Nathan, you can’t walk away from this.

317
00:25:53,093 --> 00:25:55,519
- I saw you do it.
- No you didn’t see me do it.

318
00:25:55,735 --> 00:25:57,348
Because I was with Tim the whole time.

319
00:25:57,808 --> 00:26:01,223
Which is exactly what he’s going to say if anybody asks him. He owes me.

320
00:26:03,127 --> 00:26:05,539
So it looks like its your word against ours now.

321
00:26:06,435 --> 00:26:07,925
You can guess how that’s going to go down.

322
00:26:08,032 --> 00:26:09,665
So you’re just going to lie and walk away.

323
00:26:11,033 --> 00:26:12,012
What about Peyton?

324
00:26:13,168 --> 00:26:14,295
You know, your girlfriend?

325
00:26:15,748 --> 00:26:18,406
- The car’s registered in her name.
- Yeah, and you know what?

326
00:26:18,483 --> 00:26:22,620
Come to think of it, like you said, she was really drunk last time I saw her.

327
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:24,652
Maybe she did this.

328
00:26:27,043 --> 00:26:31,693
But then again, all I see is a wrecked car... and you.

329
00:26:44,078 --> 00:26:45,762
Hit and run, huh? That’s beautiful.

330
00:26:46,530 --> 00:26:48,015
I could lose my license for this.

331
00:26:48,466 --> 00:26:50,356
I didn’t know what else do. He just walked away.

332
00:26:52,235 --> 00:26:55,081
You wanna tell me what it is with you and this girl? Huh?

333
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:58,685
That you’re willing to break the law for her? Nobody is worth that.

334
00:26:58,789 --> 00:27:01,200
I couldn’t let Nathan get away with it the way he does everything else.

335
00:27:01,287 --> 00:27:04,501
And I sure as hell could let him do that to her.

336
00:27:06,401 --> 00:27:10,052
Okay. What about the guys car you hit? Huh?

337
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:11,700
He just gets screwed over?

338
00:27:12,294 --> 00:27:15,438
I left him a note. I said I did it. Bring his car here.

339
00:27:15,910 --> 00:27:20,127
Oh, well, that’s just great. Lucas, you know I’m already struggling to bring in paying customers.

340
00:27:20,221 --> 00:27:24,020
Look, I’ll do the work myself, alright? After hours. And I’ll pay for the materials.

341
00:27:24,449 --> 00:27:25,812
Oh, you’re damn right you will.

342
00:27:26,979 --> 00:27:28,848
Your mom’s going to love this.

343
00:27:29,432 --> 00:27:32,497
No. She’s got enough to deal with. You don’t have to tell her.

344
00:27:32,682 --> 00:27:35,600
Oh, I’m not going to. You are. And if you don’t, then I will.

345
00:27:36,394 --> 00:27:38,335
Because you’re going to take something away from this.

346
00:27:40,705 --> 00:27:42,687
Cover the car. I’ll give you a ride home.

347
00:28:06,822 --> 00:28:10,161
I want to have a pipe replaced. I don’t want to send your kids to college.

348
00:28:11,030 --> 00:28:13,536
Fine. I’ll do it myself.

349
00:28:28,824 --> 00:28:30,252
I’m sorry. We’re just closing.

350
00:28:34,476 --> 00:28:36,971
I was hoping to get a coffee.

351
00:28:38,189 --> 00:28:38,823
To go.

352
00:28:54,450 --> 00:28:55,253
Anything else?

353
00:28:57,696 --> 00:28:58,664
A biscotti.

354
00:29:12,913 --> 00:29:13,983
$3.20.

355
00:29:25,006 --> 00:29:25,840
Hey.

356
00:29:27,249 --> 00:29:32,779
You tell Dan that if he wants to spy on me or threaten me or whatever the hell this is,

357
00:29:32,933 --> 00:29:35,814
- he can come down and do it himself.
- Dan didn’t send me.

358
00:29:36,331 --> 00:29:38,779
- I came on my own.
- So it’s a coincidence.

359
00:29:38,918 --> 00:29:45,634
No. I wanted you to know... everything that happened between you and Dan,

360
00:29:45,855 --> 00:29:49,014
I don’t carry that weight around and I don’t care to.

361
00:29:50,638 --> 00:29:55,731
Frankly, it looks to me like you’ve done a wonderful job raising Lucas.

362
00:29:56,311 --> 00:30:01,174
I’ve seen the two of you together, and quite honestly, it makes me a bit jealous.

363
00:30:02,024 --> 00:30:06,960
Look. Our two families... it’s really awkward.

364
00:30:07,086 --> 00:30:09,305
I’m not deluded enough to believe otherwise.

365
00:30:09,392 --> 00:30:12,618
I know how it is with you and Dan and our two boys.

366
00:30:13,119 --> 00:30:14,738
There’s a lot of history there.

367
00:30:16,176 --> 00:30:19,126
But it doesn’t have to be our history.

368
00:30:39,769 --> 00:30:41,541
You reinvented cruel tonight.

369
00:30:41,673 --> 00:30:42,830
It was a joke!

370
00:30:43,409 --> 00:30:45,202
Funny how you’re the only one laughing.

371
00:30:45,584 --> 00:30:47,245
Like you and your stupid comic strip.

372
00:30:52,564 --> 00:30:55,216
I’m sorry. I didn’t mean that.

373
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:58,151
I’m sorry is getting a little old with you, Nathan.

374
00:30:59,456 --> 00:31:00,259
I know.

375
00:31:02,190 --> 00:31:04,268
I just can’t remember a time when thing’s were this bad.

376
00:31:05,631 --> 00:31:08,017
Where have you been for the past two hours.

377
00:31:09,124 --> 00:31:11,667
- I went on a beer run.
- To where? Canada?

378
00:31:12,132 --> 00:31:16,526
Nathan, I wanted to go home. But I can’t because it seems my car’s missing.

379
00:31:16,645 --> 00:31:18,277
You wouldn’t know anything about that, would you?

380
00:31:18,717 --> 00:31:21,217
- Uh... I think Tim took it.
- You think?

381
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:24,923
Well, he wanted to take Brooke home, so I told him he could borrow it.

382
00:31:26,762 --> 00:31:27,795
I didn’t think you’d care.

383
00:31:30,919 --> 00:31:34,667
I never told a ridiculous lie to my girlfriend’s face.

384
00:31:37,027 --> 00:31:37,988
Drink up.

385
00:31:39,086 --> 00:31:42,905
Because Brooke got a ride home with Theresa after you disappeared. Wanna play again?

386
00:31:43,037 --> 00:31:45,336
Alright, so then it was some other girl. I don’t know.

387
00:31:46,185 --> 00:31:48,359
What’s the big deal anyway? I knew you were going to stay here.

388
00:31:48,486 --> 00:31:50,109
So you gave away my car?

389
00:31:50,995 --> 00:31:52,417
Look, whatever.

390
00:31:53,682 --> 00:31:55,147
I’m going to bed. Are you coming?

391
00:31:55,418 --> 00:31:57,359
Yeah. That’s what I’m gonna do.

392
00:31:59,130 --> 00:32:01,910
I cannot believe you just asked me that with a straight face.

393
00:32:09,565 --> 00:32:11,736
You will not believe the night I had tonight.

394
00:32:14,676 --> 00:32:15,662
Yeah, me too.

395
00:32:16,876 --> 00:32:18,079
What’s going on?

396
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:25,349
Well, turns out fixing the water mane is not a big deal.

397
00:32:25,448 --> 00:32:28,028
I just have to pick up a pipe at the hardware store in the morning.

398
00:32:28,141 --> 00:32:32,161
And then if you help me dig out where the break is I think we can fix this ourselves.

399
00:32:32,359 --> 00:32:33,736
So now I’m digging ditches?

400
00:32:39,476 --> 00:32:44,375
You mind telling me what happened before you destroy what’s left of my table?

401
00:32:47,362 --> 00:32:49,413
Did you know you could fit this whole house

402
00:32:49,738 --> 00:32:52,747
into the living room of their place at the beach?

403
00:32:52,952 --> 00:32:56,225
- No. Why would you even go there?
- Because I love getting dumped on.

404
00:32:56,413 --> 00:32:59,101
Well, you don’t have to put up with that. You could just walk away.

405
00:32:59,234 --> 00:33:01,036
- Like you.
- Excuse me?

406
00:33:01,283 --> 00:33:04,617
You know, you never told me that you had this whole thing mapped out with Dan.

407
00:33:05,301 --> 00:33:08,440
That you even ever talked about marriage before you were pregnant with me.

408
00:33:10,831 --> 00:33:14,263
All you ever said was that he found out and took off.

409
00:33:14,369 --> 00:33:18,583
- Wait. Where did you hear this?
- Those guys... Nathan, Nathan and his ass of a father.

410
00:33:18,645 --> 00:33:22,090
They do whatever they want. And they screw everybody else in the process.

411
00:33:22,177 --> 00:33:24,743
And yet you and I... we stand by and we let them?

412
00:33:27,282 --> 00:33:31,582
You should’ve made him give us what we were entitled to so that we didn’t have to live like this.

413
00:33:34,102 --> 00:33:35,464
You should’ve made him pay.

414
00:33:37,008 --> 00:33:40,726
Luke... what happened tonight?

415
00:33:40,876 --> 00:33:42,279
I learned something, that’s all.

416
00:33:44,809 --> 00:33:46,175
Everybody has secrets.

417
00:33:47,035 --> 00:33:47,926
Right Mom?

418
00:33:55,586 --> 00:33:56,447
Nathan!

419
00:34:07,311 --> 00:34:09,360
- Hey, what’s up?
- Did you bring my car back?

420
00:34:09,861 --> 00:34:13,036
- Your car? I don’t have your car.
- Nathan said you took my car.

421
00:34:15,397 --> 00:34:18,601
- Oh, your car. We... 
- Nice try.

422
00:34:19,287 --> 00:34:20,633
Where the hell is my car?

423
00:34:41,063 --> 00:34:42,557
You calm enough to talk?

424
00:34:45,107 --> 00:34:46,725
Sorry I went off.

425
00:34:47,667 --> 00:34:49,643
I was pissed and you were in the line of fire.

426
00:34:52,413 --> 00:34:55,244
- It’s usually when the truth comes out.
- Yeah, well, the truth is,

427
00:34:55,306 --> 00:34:59,970
I’m the reason you never got what you wanted. So that kind of nullifies my right to complain.

428
00:35:01,764 --> 00:35:03,314
Is that what you think?

429
00:35:05,587 --> 00:35:07,886
I got exactly what I want, Lucas.

430
00:35:08,982 --> 00:35:12,581
Everybody seems to think that I’m some kind of victim. I chose this.

431
00:35:12,817 --> 00:35:15,715
And if I had to do it over, you and I would still be having this conversation.

432
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:17,031
Yeah, I know, I just...

433
00:35:17,659 --> 00:35:21,751
I hate to see them get away with it, Dan and Nathan, you know. They should’ve helped you out.

434
00:35:23,799 --> 00:35:24,849
It’s not fair.

435
00:35:27,476 --> 00:35:32,575
I’m glad he never offered. Because at the time, I honestly don’t know what I would’ve said.

436
00:35:33,625 --> 00:35:36,636
But I can tell you this much, Lucas. If he had given us money,

437
00:35:37,076 --> 00:35:39,794
he’d have felt entitled to have a say in how you were being raised

438
00:35:39,845 --> 00:35:42,901
and I think that that would’ve been a bigger price to pay.

439
00:35:44,649 --> 00:35:46,537
You’ve seen how Nathan’s turned out.

440
00:35:47,571 --> 00:35:49,251
Like father, like son.

441
00:35:49,948 --> 00:35:52,093
So who do you think we should feel sorry for?

442
00:35:52,467 --> 00:35:53,839
Ourselves or them?

443
00:36:03,901 --> 00:36:04,422
Hey.

444
00:36:06,834 --> 00:36:07,905
Still not home.

445
00:36:08,973 --> 00:36:10,023
Oh he will be.

446
00:36:10,873 --> 00:36:14,565
So I take it this isn’t the first time you’ve let him stay out all night?

447
00:36:15,455 --> 00:36:18,646
Oh, I don’t want to smother him, Deb. He’s a responsible, disciplined kid.

448
00:36:18,845 --> 00:36:21,083
Is he? Hmm.

449
00:36:21,450 --> 00:36:23,320
Your brother just called.

450
00:36:23,735 --> 00:36:28,327
Our responsible, disciplined kid got into a hit and run last night.

451
00:36:28,574 --> 00:36:30,401
- In Peyton’s car.
- Is he okay?

452
00:36:30,483 --> 00:36:34,226
Oh, he’s not hurt. But do you want to know what he did afterwards?

453
00:36:36,207 --> 00:36:38,941
He walked away and tried to dump it on Lucas.

454
00:36:43,484 --> 00:36:45,992
- Well, I’ll talk to him.
- You’ll talk to him.

455
00:36:48,921 --> 00:36:51,819
- Is that all you have to say?
- What do you want me to say?

456
00:36:53,030 --> 00:36:54,942
I don’t know anymore.

457
00:36:56,042 --> 00:36:57,430
But I’ll tell you one thing.

458
00:36:57,978 --> 00:37:02,329
Seems to me you and Nathan have gotten a little too comfortable when I’m not around.

459
00:37:02,863 --> 00:37:07,814
So I’m cutting back at the foundation. Fewer hours and no more travel.

460
00:37:10,476 --> 00:37:14,439
- Try not to look so disappointed.
- Come on, Deb, you don’t have to do this.

461
00:37:14,521 --> 00:37:16,676
I don’t have to? Or you don’t want me to?

462
00:37:23,433 --> 00:37:24,202
What?

463
00:37:30,101 --> 00:37:31,289
Hey, you’re still alive.

464
00:37:31,991 --> 00:37:34,555
Guess you didn’t tell your mom about your little crime spree yet, huh?

465
00:37:34,699 --> 00:37:35,406
This morning.

466
00:37:36,142 --> 00:37:37,673
She’s working on my punishment now.

467
00:37:37,898 --> 00:37:39,583
Good. You recognize that car over there?

468
00:37:41,144 --> 00:37:42,446
The owner got your note.

469
00:37:43,270 --> 00:37:44,887
I talked him out of pressing charges.

470
00:37:45,538 --> 00:37:46,445
Thanks, Keith.

471
00:37:47,269 --> 00:37:50,254
Lets just get this done, okay? So we can get back to billing for the work we do.

472
00:37:54,099 --> 00:37:55,236
What do you want?

473
00:37:58,323 --> 00:38:00,545
I suspect his parents sent him.

474
00:38:01,630 --> 00:38:03,177
- You told them?
- Yeah.

475
00:38:03,259 --> 00:38:05,336
You may be willing to let him get away with it but I’m not.

476
00:38:06,263 --> 00:38:07,804
Try not to kill each other, girls.

477
00:38:13,846 --> 00:38:15,864
Peyton wants to know when she’s going to get her car back.

478
00:38:15,930 --> 00:38:16,950
When it’s fixed.

479
00:38:17,677 --> 00:38:21,097
- How much is the work going to cost?
- I don’t know. A lot. Why?

480
00:38:23,415 --> 00:38:26,529
Give me the invoice when it’s done. My dad will right a check.

481
00:38:26,596 --> 00:38:27,364
No thanks.

482
00:38:28,807 --> 00:38:31,393
- I said we’ll pay you.
- You want to pay me?

483
00:38:31,930 --> 00:38:33,292
You stay away from me.

484
00:38:35,970 --> 00:38:38,248
- Suit yourself.
- Hey, whatever you’re up to...

485
00:38:41,587 --> 00:38:44,362
- Stay the hell away from Haley.
- We’re just talking man.

486
00:38:45,099 --> 00:38:46,599
You know, kind of like you and Peyton.

487
00:39:01,089 --> 00:39:02,338
Car will be ready by Friday.

488
00:39:03,122 --> 00:39:03,829
Whatever.

489
00:39:04,858 --> 00:39:06,537
The bag of stuff by the door is yours.

490
00:39:07,694 --> 00:39:09,363
What’s all this?

491
00:39:09,491 --> 00:39:11,805
It’s all the crap you’ve left here. Take it.

492
00:39:11,893 --> 00:39:14,100
- This is the necklace I gave you.
- You mean the leash?

493
00:39:15,082 --> 00:39:15,840
No thanks.

494
00:39:17,211 --> 00:39:18,114
Peyton, come on.

495
00:39:19,781 --> 00:39:24,017
Look, my mom’s gong to cool down and everything will be back to normal.

496
00:39:24,103 --> 00:39:27,273
Okay, trust me, the last thing I want with us is normal.

497
00:39:27,356 --> 00:39:30,017
In case you haven’t noticed, normal sucks with us, Nathan.

498
00:39:30,105 --> 00:39:32,505
Peyton, is this about your car? Because I’m taking care of that.

499
00:39:32,582 --> 00:39:34,446
It’s not about the car. It’s about you.

500
00:39:35,179 --> 00:39:37,713
I finally saw you clearly for the first time last night.

501
00:39:37,790 --> 00:39:40,939
The way you treated me, the way you treated Tim, the way you treated your brother.

502
00:39:41,036 --> 00:39:43,683
- Don’t call him that.
- And the way you’re playing that girl.

503
00:39:43,781 --> 00:39:47,088
What? Are you talking about Haley? Is that what this is about?

504
00:39:47,333 --> 00:39:48,746
Peyton, she means nothing.

505
00:39:48,896 --> 00:39:50,985
Okay, if that’s the case, then you’re an ass.

506
00:39:51,173 --> 00:39:53,422
And even if she does mean something, you’re still an ass

507
00:39:53,503 --> 00:39:56,688
and what’s really sad, Nathan, is that you’re too stupid to get that.

508
00:39:57,237 --> 00:40:02,074
So thank you for being such an amazing son of a bitch last night. You really made this a no-brainer.

509
00:40:03,228 --> 00:40:06,176
- I’ll call you when you’re not so PMS.
- Don’t bother.

510
00:40:07,595 --> 00:40:11,112
I mean it. We’re done. So get the hell out.

511
00:40:12,212 --> 00:40:14,153
I mean it! Get the hell out!

512
00:41:32,577 --> 00:41:34,978
Hey, I was beginning to think I would never see you again.

513
00:41:35,809 --> 00:41:36,908
You’re avoiding me, right?

514
00:41:37,386 --> 00:41:38,163
A little.

515
00:41:39,366 --> 00:41:43,175
Luke, I was just trying to help. You just like, jumped down my throat.

516
00:41:46,438 --> 00:41:48,895
We’ve always been able to talk about stuff, you know.

517
00:41:50,958 --> 00:41:52,878
I just had this crazy idea that if...

518
00:41:53,876 --> 00:41:55,843
you could see things from Nathan’s side...

519
00:41:58,317 --> 00:42:00,573
You’re just a real pain in the butt sometimes.

520
00:42:03,098 --> 00:42:05,484
Yeah. At least we can still be honest with each other.

521
00:42:05,598 --> 00:42:06,789
Yeah. At least.

522
00:42:07,757 --> 00:42:09,755
So, if anything were going on with you...

523
00:42:10,461 --> 00:42:13,712
anything important or weird, or confusing...

524
00:42:14,879 --> 00:42:18,647
I mean, you could still be honest with me about that, right?

525
00:42:18,755 --> 00:42:19,919
Yeah, of course.

526
00:42:29,544 --> 00:42:31,293
You left that in Peyton’s car.
