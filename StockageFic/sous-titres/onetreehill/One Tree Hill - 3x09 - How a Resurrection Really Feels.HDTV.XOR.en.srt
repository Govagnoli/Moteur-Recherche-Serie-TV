1
00:00:17,908 --> 00:00:19,191
Better make room.

2
00:00:21,821 --> 00:00:23,859
Your other mom should be dead soon.

3
00:00:32,089 --> 00:00:33,719
Hi. Can I help you?

4
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:35,371
That's one of our shirts.

5
00:00:36,217 --> 00:00:39,268
Young lady, you're under arrest for the possession of stolen property.

6
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:42,409
What? No, no, no! I just needed something to sleep in!

7
00:00:42,487 --> 00:00:44,850
Brooke? Brooke!

8
00:00:46,615 --> 00:00:48,432
This is so "Brokedown Palace."

9
00:00:48,509 --> 00:00:51,992
I can't believe I got arrested for wearing a stupid tank top.

10
00:00:52,075 --> 00:00:53,658
I told you, you should have done your laundry.

11
00:00:53,741 --> 00:00:57,069
I got arrested for wearing one of your stupid tank tops that you stole.

12
00:00:57,141 --> 00:00:58,587
Well, sheesh.

13
00:00:58,676 --> 00:01:00,718
Guess we know who the cellblock tough's gonna be.

14
00:01:00,791 --> 00:01:03,893
Brooke, this isn't funny! This is going on my permanent record, on my college transcript,

15
00:01:03,968 --> 00:01:05,547
and I am this close to beating your ass right now!

16
00:01:05,632 --> 00:01:07,317
Okay. All right. Calm down.

17
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:08,504
Sorry.

18
00:01:08,602 --> 00:01:10,329
Um, look, I talked to them.

19
00:01:10,416 --> 00:01:12,468
I told them that the store ripped off Brooke's designs.

20
00:01:12,554 --> 00:01:16,249
So all we have to do is pay them back for the clothes, so we can go, so...

21
00:01:16,325 --> 00:01:17,049
what do you want to do?

22
00:01:17,105 --> 00:01:19,134
We should call somebody, like our parents.

23
00:01:19,219 --> 00:01:20,592
Mine are in California.

24
00:01:20,694 --> 00:01:22,624
Mine are in an R.V. somewhere.

25
00:01:22,709 --> 00:01:24,866
Mine's out to sea, or...

26
00:01:24,963 --> 00:01:27,008
dead, or banished.

27
00:01:28,339 --> 00:01:30,832
- Operator.
- Hi. Collect call, please.

28
00:01:31,112 --> 00:01:33,743
- What's his name?
- Nathan Scott.

29
00:01:34,342 --> 00:01:35,977
What do you mean, you need money?

30
00:01:37,832 --> 00:01:39,749
You know what? You're gonna rot in jail, then,

31
00:01:39,827 --> 00:01:41,622
'cause you're not getting another dime out of me.

32
00:01:41,746 --> 00:01:43,696
Aren't you supposed to be in the studio right now?

33
00:01:44,185 --> 00:01:45,190
I am.

34
00:01:45,469 --> 00:01:47,803
I just figured it would be better if I told you on the phone.

35
00:01:47,897 --> 00:01:49,800
Now, just relax. I'm coming in.

36
00:01:55,230 --> 00:01:56,633
Okay. Here's the deal.

37
00:01:56,857 --> 00:01:58,180
You gave me the money.

38
00:01:58,279 --> 00:01:59,543
I had the money.

39
00:02:00,182 --> 00:02:01,966
Then I lost the money...

40
00:02:02,145 --> 00:02:03,409
playing poker.

41
00:02:04,483 --> 00:02:06,423
Forget jail. Call the morgue.

42
00:02:06,513 --> 00:02:07,827
I gave you $2,000!

43
00:02:07,906 --> 00:02:09,742
I can get it back. I talked to the guy I lost it to.

44
00:02:09,825 --> 00:02:11,918
I just need a ride. It's about 80 miles from here.

45
00:02:12,003 --> 00:02:12,912
No way.

46
00:02:13,063 --> 00:02:15,276
I figured you'd say that, too. And I guess it's cool.

47
00:02:15,367 --> 00:02:19,153
It's just that, without the money, the studio won't release Haley's masters.

48
00:02:19,245 --> 00:02:20,555
That's the not-so-cool part.

49
00:02:20,649 --> 00:02:23,106
But, listen, you give me a ride, I'll get the money back.

50
00:02:23,192 --> 00:02:24,552
I promise.

51
00:02:28,968 --> 00:02:31,871
80 miles, you don't speak.

52
00:02:32,167 --> 00:02:32,850
Let's go.

53
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:33,945
Sweet!

54
00:02:34,281 --> 00:02:35,699
Road trip, Nate.

55
00:02:35,915 --> 00:02:37,428
Right? Road trip.

56
00:02:37,871 --> 00:02:41,584
Okay. Thank you. Oh, and Brooke keeps some extra cash under her bed and in her drawer.

57
00:02:41,837 --> 00:02:42,689
Okay.

58
00:02:42,784 --> 00:02:44,787
Hurry, please. Thank you.

59
00:02:45,948 --> 00:02:46,691
Great!

60
00:02:46,782 --> 00:02:48,293
So Nathan's coming.

61
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:52,887
Um, yeah. I-I couldn't get ahold of Nathan. I had to... call Lucas.

62
00:02:53,102 --> 00:02:57,539
Haley, if he goes in that drawer, he's gonna find all the letters I wrote him last summer.

63
00:02:57,631 --> 00:02:58,766
Good.

64
00:02:59,504 --> 00:03:01,181
It could be the best thing for you.

65
00:03:01,269 --> 00:03:03,365
It could be the worst thing for me.

66
00:03:04,123 --> 00:03:05,666
One or the other.

67
00:03:26,325 --> 00:03:27,752
Well, well.

68
00:03:27,862 --> 00:03:29,931
So that's who tried to kill me.

69
00:03:32,781 --> 00:03:34,612
Okay, girls, let's go.

70
00:03:38,542 --> 00:03:40,626
Not you, Martha Stewart.

71
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:41,684
What? Why?

72
00:03:41,779 --> 00:03:45,542
The kid with the cash... only paid for the other two.

73
00:03:45,605 --> 00:03:46,690
Wait!

74
00:03:47,938 --> 00:03:48,972
You guys all right?

75
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:51,120
Yeah. Um, Lucas, did you not pay for Brooke?

76
00:03:51,207 --> 00:03:54,879
I paid for her. I just had them wait an extra 10 minutes fore they let her go.

77
00:03:54,976 --> 00:03:56,260
So you're just screwing with her.

78
00:03:56,356 --> 00:03:57,876
And you don't think she screwed with me?

79
00:03:58,030 --> 00:04:00,862
Non-exclusive dating, the costume for the masquerade party,

80
00:04:00,941 --> 00:04:02,984
her fantasy boy draft "misunderstanding."

81
00:04:03,065 --> 00:04:06,031
I've done everything she's asked me to do so she got back, and what do I get?

82
00:04:06,127 --> 00:04:08,022
Ooh, front-row seats to her and Keller in bed together.

83
00:04:08,104 --> 00:04:11,056
Well... Luke, wait. Just stop, okay?

84
00:04:11,201 --> 00:04:12,867
It's not like you don't have a right to be upset,

85
00:04:12,937 --> 00:04:16,655
but at least wait five minutes and talk to her and then give her a ride home.

86
00:04:16,746 --> 00:04:17,552
Can't do it.

87
00:04:17,649 --> 00:04:18,476
Are you guys coming?

88
00:04:18,571 --> 00:04:20,000
I got to be at the studio right now. And I can't wait for...

89
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:21,994
It's okay. I'll wait for her.

90
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:23,094
Okay. Thank you.

91
00:04:23,744 --> 00:04:25,446
Lucas,  what am I supposed to tell Brooke?

92
00:04:26,693 --> 00:04:28,551
Tell her to call Chris Keller.

93
00:04:31,336 --> 00:04:33,366
Dude, we seriously need some tunes.

94
00:04:33,454 --> 00:04:34,440
No! Don't!

95
00:04:35,441 --> 00:04:36,367
It's jammed.

96
00:04:36,456 --> 00:04:40,003
Aw, come on, man. What's a road trip without some road tunes!

97
00:04:43,484 --> 00:04:47,852
Listen to me. This is not a road trip. This is a business trip to fix your screw-up.

98
00:04:47,944 --> 00:04:49,919
Now, we get the money. We get Haley's song.

99
00:04:50,008 --> 00:04:52,038
And, if you're lucky, I don't rearrange your face.

100
00:04:52,138 --> 00:04:53,148
Fine.

101
00:04:56,338 --> 00:04:57,311
Jeez.

102
00:05:03,024 --> 00:05:04,760
By the way, how's your poker game?

103
00:05:05,264 --> 00:05:06,146
Why?

104
00:05:06,294 --> 00:05:09,310
That's how we're gonna get the money back, playing poker.

105
00:05:13,755 --> 00:05:15,173
Hey, I fixed it.

106
00:05:15,359 --> 00:05:17,991
All you had to do was keep your word, and you couldn't do it.

107
00:05:18,075 --> 00:05:20,685
Take the money, pay the studio, and help Haley!

108
00:05:20,782 --> 00:05:22,303
I am trying to help!

109
00:05:23,334 --> 00:05:26,108
It's $100 buy-in. I got about 500 bucks.

110
00:05:26,991 --> 00:05:29,601
Okay, it's either this or you can say goodbye to Haley's demo.

111
00:05:38,321 --> 00:05:40,112
I thought you said you lost all the money.

112
00:05:40,192 --> 00:05:41,333
Oh, I did.

113
00:05:41,643 --> 00:05:44,451
It's the money your dad paid me last week to seduce Haley.

114
00:05:46,646 --> 00:05:48,700
Ow, man! My head!

115
00:05:49,157 --> 00:05:50,788
I wasn't gonna do it!

116
00:05:51,328 --> 00:05:57,326
Dan Scott would have you believe that he's the family-first candidate for Tree Hill mayor.

117
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:01,653
It's a good thing his son can't vote.

118
00:06:01,901 --> 00:06:06,020
Karen Roe -- the smart choice, the caring choice.

119
00:06:06,071 --> 00:06:08,514
You  must be pleased with yourself.

120
00:06:10,221 --> 00:06:12,804
I guess I should thank you. I mean, this little commercial of yours

121
00:06:12,891 --> 00:06:15,070
is gonna bring me a whole new batch of voters --

122
00:06:15,167 --> 00:06:17,350
wife beaters, S&M freaks.

123
00:06:17,425 --> 00:06:20,656
Who are you kidding? You're in trouble, and you know it.

124
00:06:21,042 --> 00:06:22,621
I wouldn't be so sure.

125
00:06:24,679 --> 00:06:28,675
This afternoon, when the polls open and we give our final speeches, you're gonna concede.

126
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:29,960
Really?

127
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:31,220
Or what?

128
00:06:31,312 --> 00:06:33,630
Or I'm gonna show the public who tried to kill me.

129
00:06:41,024 --> 00:06:43,125
Notice the time-and-date stamp --

130
00:06:43,339 --> 00:06:45,693
day of the fire, a few hours before.

131
00:06:46,825 --> 00:06:48,945
Now wait for it. This is the good part.

132
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:52,230
Gentlemen, we have a winner.

133
00:06:52,315 --> 00:06:55,551
I believe that's the same brand of booze used to poison me.

134
00:06:56,302 --> 00:06:59,250
And I believe that's someone you care about buying it,

135
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:01,475
someone with a motive.

136
00:07:02,951 --> 00:07:05,547
The tangled web we weave...

137
00:07:08,509 --> 00:07:11,173
Oh, when you concede today,

138
00:07:11,258 --> 00:07:13,095
make sure you say nice things about me.

139
00:07:20,923 --> 00:07:22,688
Please be there. Come on.

140
00:07:24,448 --> 00:07:26,085
Oh, thank god.

141
00:07:53,484 --> 00:07:54,405
Hi.

142
00:07:54,869 --> 00:07:55,889
How are you?

143
00:07:58,868 --> 00:08:00,167
Right. Okay.

144
00:08:03,551 --> 00:08:07,269
I don't know what to say, other than I'm so sorry.

145
00:08:07,361 --> 00:08:09,057
You have nothing to apologize for.

146
00:08:09,936 --> 00:08:10,938
We weren't together.

147
00:08:11,067 --> 00:08:11,706
Luke.

148
00:08:11,804 --> 00:08:13,785
I just didn't know "non-exclusive" meant,

149
00:08:13,868 --> 00:08:17,455
"hell, I'm gonna sleep with Chris Keller."

150
00:08:17,908 --> 00:08:19,406
Pretty skanky move, Brooke.

151
00:08:21,654 --> 00:08:23,342
I am sorry.

152
00:08:24,129 --> 00:08:27,999
I am sorry that I did it, and I am sorry that you had to see it.

153
00:08:29,114 --> 00:08:32,933
But you are looking at me right now like I am so much worse than you,

154
00:08:33,024 --> 00:08:35,809
and you were with Peyton while we were dating.

155
00:08:35,895 --> 00:08:37,658
I didn't sleep with Peyton.

156
00:08:38,818 --> 00:08:40,769
No, but you slept with Nicki.

157
00:08:41,933 --> 00:08:43,607
I didn't have feelings for you then.

158
00:08:44,583 --> 00:08:45,957
I guess that's my answer.

159
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:51,331
No, it's not, Lucas. I care about you so much.

160
00:08:52,618 --> 00:08:54,530
Well, you have a hell of a way of showing it.

161
00:08:59,896 --> 00:09:02,992
I don't know why I did it, okay? I, um...

162
00:09:04,898 --> 00:09:08,870
I mean, yeah, I-I was drinking, and I was jealous that you were with Rachel.

163
00:09:08,975 --> 00:09:10,186
But I think...

164
00:09:11,273 --> 00:09:15,268
it was really just because I was really afraid to get close to you again.

165
00:09:16,601 --> 00:09:18,979
Well, you don't have to worry about that now.

166
00:09:20,427 --> 00:09:21,427
Do you?

167
00:09:25,106 --> 00:09:29,380
I didn't expect you to be kind about this, but seeing you this way...

168
00:09:31,449 --> 00:09:33,793
it's even worse than I thought it would be.

169
00:09:37,073 --> 00:09:38,041
Good.

170
00:09:56,637 --> 00:09:59,293
Haley, there's a call for Chris. Is he coming in today?

171
00:09:59,383 --> 00:10:01,143
Uh, he's supposed to be here right now.

172
00:10:02,774 --> 00:10:04,762
Yeah. Can I take a message for Chris?

173
00:10:07,075 --> 00:10:09,980
Yeah, well, you're gonna have to get in line, 'cause he owes me money, too.

174
00:10:10,072 --> 00:10:12,183
And, trust me, I guarantee it's a lot more than he owes you

175
00:10:12,222 --> 00:10:15,280
for some Batman costume rental.

176
00:10:28,431 --> 00:10:30,296
Great. Riverboat gambling.

177
00:10:30,384 --> 00:10:31,858
Nice move, Tom Sawyer.

178
00:10:32,523 --> 00:10:35,062
Let me guess -- you got a gun in there, and we're gonna rob the place.

179
00:10:35,152 --> 00:10:36,803
Actually, that was plan "B."

180
00:10:37,404 --> 00:10:41,820
Dude, this is a 1967 Gibson Dove. I wasn't gonna leave it in that junker car of yours.

181
00:10:41,962 --> 00:10:43,687
Plus, I look cool carrying a guitar.

182
00:10:44,571 --> 00:10:45,480
Let's go.

183
00:10:47,832 --> 00:10:51,836
Oh.  Uh, the guy I lost the money to -- Marty?

184
00:10:51,963 --> 00:10:54,024
Well, he kind of scares me.

185
00:10:54,653 --> 00:10:56,991
Poker-playing psycho named Marty -- it's perfect.

186
00:10:57,087 --> 00:10:59,954
Well, well. Gang's all here.

187
00:11:00,271 --> 00:11:01,826
Nate, this is Dexter.

188
00:11:02,357 --> 00:11:03,765
This is Emanuelle.

189
00:11:04,111 --> 00:11:06,199
These are the cops. Guys.

190
00:11:06,255 --> 00:11:08,282
And this is... Marty.

191
00:11:09,243 --> 00:11:10,356
You're Marty?

192
00:11:10,798 --> 00:11:11,982
Yeah, that's right.

193
00:11:12,373 --> 00:11:13,487
Who the hell are you?

194
00:11:13,594 --> 00:11:15,628
Oh, this is Nate. He's a big poker player.

195
00:11:15,728 --> 00:11:17,029
What do you mean, "big"?

196
00:11:17,372 --> 00:11:19,208
Is that supposed to be some kind of joke?

197
00:11:19,299 --> 00:11:21,468
No, no. I just mean that he --

198
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:23,836
Hey, can we play or what, right?

199
00:11:23,951 --> 00:11:25,129
I don't know, can you?

200
00:11:25,221 --> 00:11:29,241
You got your buy-in, Keller, or are you a little, uh, short?

201
00:11:32,990 --> 00:11:35,990
Chris Keller, the human ATM.

202
00:11:36,619 --> 00:11:37,733
It's your loss.

203
00:11:46,278 --> 00:11:48,063
What are you watching?

204
00:11:48,653 --> 00:11:51,023
I don't know, but they seem sad.

205
00:11:52,165 --> 00:11:53,935
Did you talk to Lucas?

206
00:11:55,683 --> 00:11:56,610
Sorry.

207
00:11:57,778 --> 00:11:59,380
Where did we go so wrong?

208
00:11:59,841 --> 00:12:00,826
Well...

209
00:12:02,371 --> 00:12:04,794
I slept with Chris Keller, and you went on tour with him.

210
00:12:04,918 --> 00:12:06,008
No, I mean...

211
00:12:06,748 --> 00:12:08,123
okay, yeah.

212
00:12:08,357 --> 00:12:11,416
But when did we start letting boys dictate our happiness?

213
00:12:11,511 --> 00:12:12,744
I was 9.

214
00:12:13,277 --> 00:12:15,909
Well, I-I don't care. It has to stop.

215
00:12:16,024 --> 00:12:17,954
You've got too much talent with your fashion line.

216
00:12:18,052 --> 00:12:18,920
Not anymore.

217
00:12:19,017 --> 00:12:22,772
Oh,  so what? So they stole a couple of designs. They didn't steal your talent.

218
00:12:22,876 --> 00:12:24,347
I'm sure you've got more.

219
00:12:25,173 --> 00:12:26,828
A couple unfinished dresses.

220
00:12:26,913 --> 00:12:28,065
So finish them.

221
00:12:28,438 --> 00:12:31,110
Listen, we'll, um... we'll put together a website,

222
00:12:31,202 --> 00:12:33,140
and we'll sell them ourselves.

223
00:12:33,448 --> 00:12:34,518
You'd help me?

224
00:12:34,605 --> 00:12:36,052
Yeah, I'd help you.

225
00:12:36,518 --> 00:12:38,650
You have to help yourself first, though, missy.

226
00:12:41,139 --> 00:12:42,943
Clothes over bros?

227
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:46,058
Clothes over bros.

228
00:12:54,866 --> 00:12:57,358
Okay. This is crap.

229
00:12:57,473 --> 00:13:00,082
- What's that? 
- You being here.

230
00:13:00,176 --> 00:13:02,541
It's one thing for you to haunt my dreams, but I'm awake now.

231
00:13:02,631 --> 00:13:03,813
You sure about that?

232
00:13:04,625 --> 00:13:06,539
Besides,  guilt never sleeps.

233
00:13:06,623 --> 00:13:07,623
"Guilt"?

234
00:13:07,844 --> 00:13:12,274
Oh. Oh, okay, so that's it. You're what, my subconscious?

235
00:13:12,357 --> 00:13:15,994
No, no. I'm just, like, the little voice inside your head,

236
00:13:16,074 --> 00:13:18,139
only I'm not so much on the inside now.

237
00:13:18,231 --> 00:13:20,274
Fine. I'm talking to myself.

238
00:13:20,366 --> 00:13:23,615
I'll play along. Hey, what are you doing here?

239
00:13:23,692 --> 00:13:26,764
I'm having a snack. See, it's pretty great, actually.

240
00:13:27,436 --> 00:13:29,802
I eat, and you get fat.

241
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:33,889
Oh, hey. I fixed this for you.

242
00:13:39,365 --> 00:13:41,092
"People always greave"?

243
00:13:42,546 --> 00:13:43,807
You spelled it wrong.

244
00:13:43,898 --> 00:13:47,002
Well, if I spelled it wrong, then so did you.

245
00:13:47,107 --> 00:13:49,387
Who knew my subconscious could be such a bitch?

246
00:13:49,473 --> 00:13:51,251
No, no. We're a bitch.

247
00:13:51,349 --> 00:13:52,984
Try to keep up, okay?

248
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,718
Oh, hey. Check it out.

249
00:13:55,909 --> 00:13:59,154
Closet full of anxiety. Get it?

250
00:13:59,561 --> 00:14:01,716
Look, ghost of Christmas goth,

251
00:14:01,790 --> 00:14:04,792
what do I have to do or say to get rid of you?

252
00:14:04,936 --> 00:14:06,539
That's easy.

253
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:08,604
Where's your bracelet?

254
00:14:08,753 --> 00:14:09,807
P. Sawyer!

255
00:14:10,446 --> 00:14:11,995
Oh, I'm sorry. Were you sleeping?

256
00:14:12,071 --> 00:14:13,411
I think so.

257
00:14:14,674 --> 00:14:16,699
I guess I lost Ellie's cancer bracelet.

258
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,968
Nothing. What's up?

259
00:14:20,702 --> 00:14:24,032
I just need some artwork for my new fashion line.

260
00:14:24,558 --> 00:14:26,722
You mean the fashion line that Suburban Filth owns?

261
00:14:26,811 --> 00:14:29,913
No, I mean my new fashion line. Haley helped me see the light.

262
00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:33,280
Instead of making out, I should be making clothes.

263
00:14:33,456 --> 00:14:36,373
Although clothes make you look hot, then boys want to make out with you.

264
00:14:36,453 --> 00:14:39,231
Not the point. I'm moving on, and I'm doing my own thing.

265
00:14:39,834 --> 00:14:42,090
These are perfect. So sleep it up.

266
00:14:42,183 --> 00:14:45,523
Come over tonight, 'cause my stuff is gonna rock your socks.

267
00:14:55,314 --> 00:14:56,381
You're bluffing.

268
00:14:57,885 --> 00:14:59,550
Then call me and find out.

269
00:15:00,186 --> 00:15:01,829
I'll do more than that.

270
00:15:02,036 --> 00:15:04,818
I'll raise you, Marty. All in.

271
00:15:05,311 --> 00:15:06,562
Dude, maybe you shouldn't do that.

272
00:15:06,642 --> 00:15:07,889
He's bluffing.

273
00:15:11,262 --> 00:15:12,871
Read 'em and weep.

274
00:15:13,473 --> 00:15:15,363
It's practically an orgy!

275
00:15:19,624 --> 00:15:20,850
A pair of 3s?

276
00:15:20,946 --> 00:15:23,411
You lost everything on a pair of 3s?!

277
00:15:23,637 --> 00:15:25,013
You suck at this, Chris.

278
00:15:25,105 --> 00:15:27,782
Keller, you look like a toilet at the airport --

279
00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:29,574
broke and full of crap.

280
00:15:30,405 --> 00:15:31,327
What about these?

281
00:15:31,418 --> 00:15:33,587
This car's worth at least 2 grand.

282
00:15:33,944 --> 00:15:35,050
Hold on.

283
00:15:35,142 --> 00:15:36,636
I'll give you 50 bucks for it.

284
00:15:36,724 --> 00:15:37,196
Done.

285
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:39,275
No way in hell! Dude, let's just get out here!

286
00:15:39,372 --> 00:15:41,787
You want to get Haley's tape back, or what?

287
00:15:42,322 --> 00:15:43,361
I'll tell you what.

288
00:15:43,454 --> 00:15:46,373
Here's 50 bucks and a condom.

289
00:15:47,385 --> 00:15:49,199
You two can get a room.

290
00:15:49,353 --> 00:15:50,876
We're playing poker.

291
00:16:34,709 --> 00:16:37,184
Hi. It's me.

292
00:16:37,377 --> 00:16:39,906
I, uh... I need to ask you something.

293
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:43,028
Did you try to kill Dan?

294
00:16:44,629 --> 00:16:46,078
Because I, uh...

295
00:16:47,133 --> 00:16:49,100
I need to know the truth.

296
00:16:54,788 --> 00:16:56,664
Been on a hell of a roll, kid.

297
00:16:57,084 --> 00:16:58,705
Nobody's that lucky.

298
00:16:58,956 --> 00:17:00,206
What's the matter, Marty?

299
00:17:00,295 --> 00:17:01,443
Short temper?

300
00:17:02,123 --> 00:17:03,458
No, something's messed up.

301
00:17:03,557 --> 00:17:04,889
Yeah, your teeth.

302
00:17:05,274 --> 00:17:07,302
No. He's right.

303
00:17:07,432 --> 00:17:10,407
For the last two hours, every time you deal, he wins.

304
00:17:10,488 --> 00:17:11,617
No, not every time.

305
00:17:11,696 --> 00:17:13,324
But for the last two hours!

306
00:17:13,431 --> 00:17:16,057
Whoa! What are you saying, Marty?

307
00:17:16,082 --> 00:17:17,785
What I'm trying to say is this --

308
00:17:17,892 --> 00:17:20,531
if we turn over those cards and he has a pair of anything,

309
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,503
your ass is as good as dead.

310
00:17:22,892 --> 00:17:25,832
You know what? This is crap. Nathan, let's go.

311
00:17:26,145 --> 00:17:28,553
All right. Hold on, hold on. I've lost a lot tonight.

312
00:17:28,654 --> 00:17:29,951
Not lately.

313
00:17:30,068 --> 00:17:31,058
We got a problem here?

314
00:17:31,152 --> 00:17:31,950
No problem...

315
00:17:32,043 --> 00:17:34,357
Yeah. Not a problem here.

316
00:17:36,172 --> 00:17:38,319
...So long as that card's not a jack.

317
00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:44,917
Okay, look, Marty, I don't want to hit you because you're --

318
00:17:44,934 --> 00:17:46,541
You got something to say? You say it, Keller!

319
00:17:46,569 --> 00:17:47,179
Aw, hell.

320
00:17:54,992 --> 00:17:56,040
Running!

321
00:18:15,229 --> 00:18:16,514
Dude, we got to jump.

322
00:18:16,689 --> 00:18:18,457
No way, man. Chris Keller can't swim.

323
00:18:18,541 --> 00:18:20,064
It's either jump or die!

324
00:18:21,145 --> 00:18:23,475
You're not hearing me. I can't swim!

325
00:18:23,564 --> 00:18:24,365
Do you have the money?

326
00:18:24,458 --> 00:18:25,939
- Yeah, I got it right here, man.
- Okay. Good.

327
00:18:29,042 --> 00:18:30,222
What the hell?!

328
00:18:30,326 --> 00:18:31,059
Go!

329
00:19:04,301 --> 00:19:05,454
All right!

330
00:19:05,730 --> 00:19:07,044
Not bad.

331
00:19:07,215 --> 00:19:08,513
Are you serious?

332
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,707
My cellphone's shot,

333
00:19:10,848 --> 00:19:13,507
we're in the middle of nowhere, and you check your guitar?

334
00:19:13,596 --> 00:19:15,707
How about a thank-you for not letting you drown?

335
00:19:15,798 --> 00:19:18,522
Whoa. Chris Keller was dog-paddling just fine.

336
00:19:18,565 --> 00:19:20,552
Chris Keller was sinking just fine!

337
00:19:23,309 --> 00:19:24,313
Give me the money.

338
00:19:29,532 --> 00:19:32,134
Oh, I must have lost it all in the river.

339
00:19:33,957 --> 00:19:35,753
I should have let you drown.

340
00:19:41,448 --> 00:19:44,508
Wait up, man! It's spooky out here!

341
00:19:51,184 --> 00:19:52,048
You okay?

342
00:19:52,490 --> 00:19:54,325
Oh, just a little nervous.

343
00:19:54,485 --> 00:19:59,179
The polls are open, and, uh, in a few minutes, I give my final address.

344
00:19:59,611 --> 00:20:02,977
Mom, Dan just told me he thinks someone tried to kill him.

345
00:20:03,531 --> 00:20:06,298
The fire was ruled an accident.

346
00:20:06,438 --> 00:20:07,991
But what if it wasn't?

347
00:20:08,307 --> 00:20:10,886
You know, and what if he does have proof?

348
00:20:11,026 --> 00:20:14,189
Is winning this election worth the risk?

349
00:20:14,896 --> 00:20:16,174
Maybe you should...

350
00:20:17,469 --> 00:20:18,823
concede, mom.

351
00:20:19,154 --> 00:20:20,770
Final statements, Karen.

352
00:20:23,072 --> 00:20:24,433
These came for you.

353
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:29,765
And you know I have to stand by Dan tonight. I just, uh...

354
00:20:31,290 --> 00:20:32,385
Good luck.

355
00:20:39,389 --> 00:20:40,752
They're from Andy.

356
00:20:46,843 --> 00:20:50,367
Whatever you say, be sure not to stumble on the word "concede."

357
00:20:58,046 --> 00:20:58,928
Thank you.

358
00:21:01,064 --> 00:21:06,879
A few minutes ago, my son asked me how important this election was to me.

359
00:21:07,055 --> 00:21:10,311
And my answer to him is that it's very important.

360
00:21:11,245 --> 00:21:13,003
But what's more important?

361
00:21:14,030 --> 00:21:16,026
Believing in your fellow man.

362
00:21:16,623 --> 00:21:19,645
Having faith in a person's character.

363
00:21:19,997 --> 00:21:23,405
Trusting that a person is who we think they are

364
00:21:23,497 --> 00:21:26,915
and defending that trust until we're given proof

365
00:21:27,012 --> 00:21:30,457
beyond a reasonable doubt that we should no longer do so.

366
00:21:32,812 --> 00:21:34,421
With that said...

367
00:21:35,863 --> 00:21:40,310
I wish to concede... but not the election.

368
00:21:40,865 --> 00:21:43,977
I  wish to concede that when I decided to run for mayor,

369
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:46,790
I underestimated my opponent

370
00:21:46,899 --> 00:21:51,184
and the depths to which he will go to hurt and to humiliate others.

371
00:21:52,230 --> 00:21:54,762
You have seen the commercials.

372
00:21:54,938 --> 00:21:58,729
You have seen the real Dan Scott.

373
00:21:59,150 --> 00:22:03,041
Now do the right thing and vote for Karen Roe.

374
00:22:15,994 --> 00:22:18,580
My opponent has decided to write me off

375
00:22:18,735 --> 00:22:21,631
based on a recent video that I'm sure you've all seen.

376
00:22:22,789 --> 00:22:27,660
Well, I'd like to tell you that that video is a fabrication, a fake.

377
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:30,776
I'd like to tell you that,

378
00:22:31,666 --> 00:22:33,627
but I'm afraid that would be a lie.

379
00:22:34,585 --> 00:22:37,145
It's an accurate depiction of a man at his worst,

380
00:22:37,237 --> 00:22:38,740
and I'm not proud of it.

381
00:22:38,823 --> 00:22:41,882
And so, today, I ask for understanding,

382
00:22:41,981 --> 00:22:43,488
for forgiveness...

383
00:22:44,744 --> 00:22:46,179
for a second chance.

384
00:22:54,972 --> 00:22:56,066
I'm sorry.

385
00:22:58,735 --> 00:23:01,945
They say identification is the first step to recovery.

386
00:23:02,545 --> 00:23:05,459
I stand fore you, a man who woke up.

387
00:23:05,567 --> 00:23:07,331
I am not perfect.

388
00:23:07,457 --> 00:23:09,797
I'm just a guy trying to be a good husband...

389
00:23:09,929 --> 00:23:12,683
and a father who sometimes comes up short.

390
00:23:13,404 --> 00:23:17,394
And if you elect me, you'll be electing a work in progress.

391
00:23:17,483 --> 00:23:21,760
But you'll also be electing a man who will never put himself above any of you

392
00:23:22,195 --> 00:23:24,849
or above the town that I love.

393
00:23:26,487 --> 00:23:28,962
I woke up to be your mayor!

394
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:33,056
And I promise never to sleep on the job again!

395
00:23:48,707 --> 00:23:51,863
Brooke, come on! Just show us what you have so far!

396
00:23:51,946 --> 00:23:52,738
Come on!

397
00:23:52,826 --> 00:23:55,524
Okay. So these are just prototypes,

398
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:58,465
but I introduce you to my new line --

399
00:23:58,624 --> 00:23:59,968
"Clothes over Bro's."

400
00:24:00,493 --> 00:24:02,154
Brooke, that's awesome!

401
00:24:02,256 --> 00:24:03,643
Thanks, but there's more.

402
00:24:03,756 --> 00:24:07,058
We've got the flaming-heart ring tee.

403
00:24:07,324 --> 00:24:11,623
We have "'C' over 'B'" sweats...

404
00:24:12,019 --> 00:24:12,829
I like that.

405
00:24:12,934 --> 00:24:19,132
And the tutor-girl, P. Sawyer-inspired, "Clothes over Bro's" concert jerseys.

406
00:24:19,274 --> 00:24:21,093
These are awesome Brooke. This rocks.

407
00:24:21,172 --> 00:24:24,309
I know, but every designer needs her couture line,

408
00:24:24,410 --> 00:24:27,870
so I'm now introducing you to "Clothes over Bro's" upscale.

409
00:24:35,802 --> 00:24:39,121
- Oh, my gosh, Brooke.
- You made that?

410
00:24:39,741 --> 00:24:41,987
- I made that.
- That's gorgeous.

411
00:24:42,107 --> 00:24:43,538
So cute, right?

412
00:24:46,150 --> 00:24:47,987
See, that's more me!

413
00:24:52,006 --> 00:24:53,437
That's so pretty.

414
00:24:53,476 --> 00:24:54,723
That's cute.

415
00:25:01,808 --> 00:25:02,864
Trouble.

416
00:25:05,964 --> 00:25:08,697
And they're all available at ClothesOverBros.com.

417
00:25:12,237 --> 00:25:13,156
Thanks.

418
00:25:17,135 --> 00:25:18,831
Come on, man. Slow down.

419
00:25:18,936 --> 00:25:20,600
* shape * weak.

420
00:25:20,691 --> 00:25:24,817
Dude, we're 80 miles from home and you gambled my damn car away.

421
00:25:25,839 --> 00:25:30,443
No, not exactly, actually I grabbed your keys right before Marty punched me in the crotch

422
00:25:31,692 --> 00:25:36,018
In other news, um, actually I have about 500 dollars left on me so...

423
00:25:36,268 --> 00:25:37,928
...basically, we broke even.

424
00:25:38,057 --> 00:25:41,535
You call this "breaking even", I thought we were actually winning!

425
00:25:42,445 --> 00:25:44,640
I should've known you can't be honest.

426
00:25:45,208 --> 00:25:46,563
I can be honest.

427
00:25:46,710 --> 00:25:48,205
No, you can't.

428
00:25:49,364 --> 00:25:52,562
I kissed Haley... at the masquerade party.

429
00:25:57,812 --> 00:25:59,670
Man, I was trying to help you!

430
00:25:59,766 --> 00:26:00,316
Wh--

431
00:26:01,910 --> 00:26:03,984
See, this is why I'm never honest!

432
00:26:04,251 --> 00:26:05,350
Now, stop hitting me.

433
00:26:05,439 --> 00:26:06,704
Stop kissing my wife!

434
00:26:06,790 --> 00:26:08,459
I will when you start kissing her.

435
00:26:13,586 --> 00:26:15,777
What the hell is wrong with you?!

436
00:26:15,826 --> 00:26:16,937
Listen.

437
00:26:17,024 --> 00:26:20,651
The night you called me to come to town was the night of the masquerade party.

438
00:26:20,991 --> 00:26:23,157
I thought it'd be funny if we both went in the same costume,

439
00:26:23,237 --> 00:26:25,964
so I bribed the guy at the costume shop to tell me what you rented.

440
00:26:26,054 --> 00:26:30,042
But then I got there and I saw you and Haley weren't getting along.

441
00:26:30,142 --> 00:26:33,972
So I thought if I just kissed her -- I know! Okay, it was stupid, all right?

442
00:26:34,685 --> 00:26:36,026
But I did it for you.

443
00:26:36,124 --> 00:26:37,375
I didn't do it for me.

444
00:26:40,381 --> 00:26:41,367
So are we even?

445
00:26:41,566 --> 00:26:42,583
"Even"?

446
00:26:43,530 --> 00:26:46,311
You kissed my wife. You lost all my money.

447
00:26:46,393 --> 00:26:48,036
You lied to me about the poker game,

448
00:26:48,111 --> 00:26:50,655
and you got me attacked by a midget and a transvestite.

449
00:26:50,739 --> 00:26:51,900
Whoa, whoa.

450
00:26:52,948 --> 00:26:54,738
You think Emanuelle's a dude?

451
00:26:54,808 --> 00:26:57,691
E-man-uelle has an adam's apple.

452
00:26:58,289 --> 00:26:59,185
Oops.

453
00:27:01,319 --> 00:27:02,861
You want to know the worst part?

454
00:27:03,774 --> 00:27:05,925
Haley's the one that suffers the most.

455
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:10,685
She put her heart and soul into that song, and you screwed her over.

456
00:27:12,165 --> 00:27:13,457
Nice work.

457
00:27:14,438 --> 00:27:15,726
You should be proud of that.

458
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:25,171
Pretty great, huh?

459
00:27:25,227 --> 00:27:26,241
Yeah.

460
00:27:27,059 --> 00:27:31,365
Yeah, I don't think you need the apostrophe though in bro's, it's not really grammatically correct.

461
00:27:31,455 --> 00:27:34,012
It's my fashion line and I'm keeping the apostrophe.

462
00:27:34,043 --> 00:27:36,022
Okay, well, good for you.

463
00:27:36,106 --> 00:27:37,664
You did it all yourself, anyway.

464
00:27:37,750 --> 00:27:39,784
Not really, you got me there.

465
00:27:40,730 --> 00:27:42,742
Yeah, I kinda feel like a big fraud though...

466
00:27:42,824 --> 00:27:44,664
What? Why?

467
00:27:44,752 --> 00:27:46,930
Because I told yourself to put yourself before boys,

468
00:27:46,961 --> 00:27:50,047
and I secretly spent the whole day thinking about Nathan.

469
00:27:50,271 --> 00:27:52,213
Why? Did something happen?

470
00:27:52,378 --> 00:27:55,912
You know how I told you that Nathan kissed me at the masquerade party?

471
00:27:55,931 --> 00:27:56,858
Yeah.

472
00:27:57,805 --> 00:27:59,623
It might not have been Nathan.

473
00:28:00,726 --> 00:28:02,634
I think it might have been Chris.

474
00:28:02,929 --> 00:28:03,988
Kringle?

475
00:28:05,103 --> 00:28:06,687
No, I didn't think so.

476
00:28:06,795 --> 00:28:12,196
W-wow. How could you kiss Chris Keller and then think that Chris was Nathan?

477
00:28:12,282 --> 00:28:16,754
Maybe I just wanted to believe that it was Nathan so bad that...

478
00:28:17,875 --> 00:28:19,578
What if I was wrong, though?

479
00:28:20,248 --> 00:28:23,295
He could just be trying to keep things pleasant until the divorce is final.

480
00:28:23,376 --> 00:28:25,404
I do not believe that.

481
00:28:25,789 --> 00:28:27,156
I don't.

482
00:28:28,974 --> 00:28:30,495
It's hard, isn't it?

483
00:28:31,511 --> 00:28:34,976
I mean, I love my clothes.

484
00:28:36,765 --> 00:28:40,140
There's an ache in my heart where Lucas used to be.

485
00:28:41,099 --> 00:28:47,229
I don't think covering it up with a stylish and smartly priced sweat top's gonna make it go away.

486
00:28:47,901 --> 00:28:49,404
It is stylish, though.

487
00:28:53,906 --> 00:28:54,842
Well?

488
00:28:56,549 --> 00:28:58,151
What do you know? I got them.

489
00:29:00,359 --> 00:29:01,012
Get out of here.

490
00:29:01,097 --> 00:29:04,657
No, that's everything. That's the masters, demo -- bought and paid for.

491
00:29:05,085 --> 00:29:07,002
We only had 500 bucks.

492
00:29:07,438 --> 00:29:09,536
I got a way with people, I guess.

493
00:29:13,451 --> 00:29:16,137
Listen, I'm -- I'm gonna be taking off.

494
00:29:16,791 --> 00:29:19,587
I may not see you for a while, so, uh...

495
00:29:21,739 --> 00:29:24,259
Well, whatever.

496
00:29:29,486 --> 00:29:31,053
You sold your guitar.

497
00:29:32,532 --> 00:29:34,571
The thing was waterlogged, anyway.

498
00:29:35,076 --> 00:29:36,462
You love that guitar.

499
00:29:41,763 --> 00:29:42,970
Well, hey...

500
00:29:43,763 --> 00:29:45,240
I guess this makes us even.

501
00:29:49,275 --> 00:29:51,661
Maybe so, but that's not why I did it.

502
00:29:53,083 --> 00:29:55,096
You tell Haley that song is a hit.

503
00:29:56,101 --> 00:29:58,492
Or maybe don't, unless you want to lose her again.

504
00:30:05,689 --> 00:30:06,715
Hey.

505
00:30:09,516 --> 00:30:10,802
Where are you going?

506
00:30:11,971 --> 00:30:14,063
Chris Keller's work here is done.

507
00:30:29,824 --> 00:30:31,687
- Did you find it yet?
- Damn it!

508
00:30:36,042 --> 00:30:37,464
Let me ask you something.

509
00:30:37,717 --> 00:30:40,115
If I have a heart attack, do you die, too?

510
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:42,568
That's -- that's really sweet.

511
00:30:42,662 --> 00:30:44,939
Okay, I am not arguing with you.

512
00:30:45,052 --> 00:30:48,846
Oh, come on, Peyton! That's what we do, okay?

513
00:30:48,963 --> 00:30:51,646
We have these inner conversations daily.

514
00:30:51,752 --> 00:30:53,760
"Am I gonna look stupid?"

515
00:30:53,856 --> 00:30:55,618
"Am I pretty enough?"

516
00:30:55,856 --> 00:30:58,810
"Did Jake just want to get in my pants?"

517
00:30:58,991 --> 00:31:01,643
"Should Lucas be with me instead of Brooke?"

518
00:31:01,719 --> 00:31:03,391
No, okay? You're wrong.

519
00:31:03,735 --> 00:31:05,735
Lucas and I are just friends.

520
00:31:05,908 --> 00:31:07,483
And Jake loved me.

521
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:10,770
Whatever you say... cheerleader.

522
00:31:11,761 --> 00:31:13,400
"Poor me."

523
00:31:13,496 --> 00:31:16,327
Whine, whine, mope, mope.

524
00:31:16,426 --> 00:31:18,407
Always the victim!

525
00:31:18,511 --> 00:31:21,690
"My mom died. Jake left. Ellie lied."

526
00:31:21,770 --> 00:31:23,287
Boohoo.

527
00:31:24,987 --> 00:31:26,684
You really are a bitch.

528
00:31:26,757 --> 00:31:29,124
I'm not the one that sent Ellie away.

529
00:31:31,924 --> 00:31:33,750
People always leave?

530
00:31:34,143 --> 00:31:36,236
Or Peyton always drives them away?

531
00:31:37,850 --> 00:31:39,822
Where's the bracelet, Peyton?

532
00:31:43,702 --> 00:31:46,366
And it looks as though Dan Scott's narrow lead will hold in

533
00:31:46,434 --> 00:31:49,108
one of the closest decisions we've ever seen.

534
00:31:49,182 --> 00:31:50,706
Now back to you, Bill.

535
00:31:52,785 --> 00:31:54,407
It's still close. You never know.

536
00:31:54,477 --> 00:31:55,777
I'm afraid I do.

537
00:31:55,997 --> 00:31:58,505
Dan Scott's the freaking mayor!

538
00:31:58,602 --> 00:32:00,088
You did your best, mom.

539
00:32:00,414 --> 00:32:01,599
Don't be sad.

540
00:32:01,996 --> 00:32:04,625
It's not that. It's Dan.

541
00:32:05,264 --> 00:32:07,750
And even though he might be wrong about the fire,

542
00:32:07,835 --> 00:32:11,778
if he thinks it's intentional, he won't stop until he finds someone to blame.

543
00:32:12,111 --> 00:32:14,340
I worry for that person, Lucas.

544
00:32:15,938 --> 00:32:17,223
I really do.

545
00:32:18,076 --> 00:32:25,173
Ladies and gentlemen, the soon-to-be mayor of Tree Hill, North Carolina, Dan Scott!

546
00:32:40,542 --> 00:32:41,983
It makes you wonder, huh?

547
00:32:42,761 --> 00:32:45,345
Do the wicked never lose?

548
00:32:45,539 --> 00:32:46,957
Hi, Lucas.

549
00:32:47,527 --> 00:32:48,922
How's your mom doing?

550
00:32:50,203 --> 00:32:51,859
She's worried about you.

551
00:32:52,461 --> 00:32:54,058
She just doesn't know it.

552
00:32:55,109 --> 00:32:56,214
What do you mean?

553
00:33:06,163 --> 00:33:08,240
"For everything you've done."

554
00:33:09,416 --> 00:33:10,777
I-I don't understand.

555
00:33:10,899 --> 00:33:12,196
I think you do.

556
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:22,254
That's the last shred of evidence.

557
00:33:23,706 --> 00:33:27,047
As far as I know, there's nothing else to tie you to this, Deb.

558
00:33:27,122 --> 00:33:29,044
Ladies and gentlemen, can I have your attention, please?

559
00:33:29,079 --> 00:33:32,249
I've just received word that, in a matter of minutes, the votes will be in

560
00:33:32,333 --> 00:33:34,501
and victory will be ours!

561
00:33:35,931 --> 00:33:38,102
He knows it wasn't an accident.

562
00:33:42,670 --> 00:33:44,449
But he doesn't have proof.

563
00:33:44,555 --> 00:33:46,332
They said we were beaten!

564
00:33:47,993 --> 00:33:49,965
They said we were dead!

565
00:33:52,390 --> 00:33:54,776
Maybe this can finally set you free.

566
00:33:54,832 --> 00:33:56,766
But they should know by now,

567
00:33:57,168 --> 00:33:59,841
you can't kill Dan Scott!

568
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:17,896
I didn't do this alone.

569
00:34:18,609 --> 00:34:22,541
And to that end, I'd like to bring out my beautiful and supportive wife, Deb,

570
00:34:22,638 --> 00:34:24,474
to enjoy the moment with me.

571
00:34:31,682 --> 00:34:33,716
I guess it's true what they say.

572
00:34:33,814 --> 00:34:35,533
It's lonely at the top.

573
00:35:11,089 --> 00:35:12,517
I can't find it.

574
00:35:14,129 --> 00:35:16,564
Why do you think Ellie came to see us, Peyton?

575
00:35:16,809 --> 00:35:18,509
She has cancer.

576
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:20,107
She has regrets.

577
00:35:20,424 --> 00:35:21,891
She's closing up shop.

578
00:35:21,983 --> 00:35:23,112
She's in remission.

579
00:35:23,210 --> 00:35:24,748
You know that's a lie.

580
00:35:24,851 --> 00:35:26,856
- She's dying.
- No, she's not!

581
00:35:26,942 --> 00:35:28,373
Where is the bracelet, Peyton?!

582
00:35:28,464 --> 00:35:30,507
I lost it, okay?!

583
00:35:42,715 --> 00:35:46,658
The last thing she wanted in this world was to get to know you.

584
00:35:47,349 --> 00:35:50,413
And you sent her away.

585
00:36:02,125 --> 00:36:03,688
Hi. It's me.

586
00:36:04,390 --> 00:36:05,956
Lucas knows.

587
00:36:20,165 --> 00:36:21,160
Hi.

588
00:36:22,164 --> 00:36:24,081
Hey. Thanks for coming.

589
00:36:24,122 --> 00:36:25,916
Yeah, thanks for calling me.

590
00:36:27,187 --> 00:36:28,222
What's wrong?

591
00:36:30,877 --> 00:36:33,326
Your song is great, Haley.

592
00:36:33,828 --> 00:36:37,995
Chris played it for me. It's a -- it's a long story, but...

593
00:36:38,781 --> 00:36:40,000
it's really great.

594
00:36:40,384 --> 00:36:41,918
I just wanted you to know that.

595
00:36:42,498 --> 00:36:44,150
Oh. Okay.

596
00:36:46,190 --> 00:36:47,562
My mom left...

597
00:36:48,471 --> 00:36:50,469
for good, I think.

598
00:36:51,611 --> 00:36:54,215
Oh, and, apparently, my dad's the mayor now.

599
00:36:55,094 --> 00:36:58,923
So... yeah, today really sucked ass.

600
00:36:59,011 --> 00:37:01,974
Oh Nathan, I'm so sorry.

601
00:37:06,144 --> 00:37:09,692
You know, for most of my life, I would have gone through all this alone.

602
00:37:10,302 --> 00:37:11,643
Then I met you,

603
00:37:11,732 --> 00:37:15,381
and I finally found someone I could depend on when life got like this.

604
00:37:17,415 --> 00:37:19,359
So I guess I called you...

605
00:37:19,676 --> 00:37:23,029
'cause I wanted to know if that was still there.

606
00:37:24,708 --> 00:37:27,133
Nathan, you can always call me.

607
00:37:28,291 --> 00:37:29,916
Always and forever.

608
00:37:32,955 --> 00:37:34,630
I want to ask you something.

609
00:37:36,729 --> 00:37:39,724
The night of the masquerade party, did we --

610
00:37:40,425 --> 00:37:42,269
did you kiss me?

611
00:37:45,939 --> 00:37:47,582
Of course I did.

612
00:37:57,932 --> 00:38:00,632
Oh, no, you didn't.

613
00:38:04,083 --> 00:38:07,003
That kiss wasn't half as good as this one.

614
00:38:08,719 --> 00:38:11,121
But I love you for lying to me.

615
00:38:16,570 --> 00:38:18,357
Thanks for calling.

616
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:25,320
- Haley.
- Yeah?

617
00:38:26,914 --> 00:38:28,283
Stay with me tonight.

618
00:38:30,711 --> 00:38:33,236
Oh, I was hoping you would say that.

619
00:39:03,847 --> 00:39:06,007
There are 82 letters in here,

620
00:39:06,446 --> 00:39:08,387
and they're all addressed to you.

621
00:39:10,531 --> 00:39:12,582
I wrote them all this summer.

622
00:39:13,290 --> 00:39:17,557
One a day, but I never sent them because I was afraid.

623
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:20,896
Brooke.

624
00:39:20,991 --> 00:39:23,946
I was afraid of getting my heart broken again...

625
00:39:24,606 --> 00:39:26,253
like before.

626
00:39:27,467 --> 00:39:29,952
'Cause you hurt me so bad and...

627
00:39:30,729 --> 00:39:32,802
I was afraid to be vulnerable.

628
00:39:32,892 --> 00:39:36,578
And I was afraid of you and the way that you make me feel.

629
00:39:37,180 --> 00:39:40,358
And I know that doesn't matter now, after what I did.

630
00:39:40,506 --> 00:39:42,910
But I just thought that you should know.

631
00:39:45,541 --> 00:39:48,618
This is how I spent my summer, Luke...

632
00:39:49,816 --> 00:39:51,347
wanting you.

633
00:39:53,125 --> 00:39:55,394
I was just too scared to admit it.

634
00:40:00,843 --> 00:40:01,943
Brooke!

635
00:40:05,052 --> 00:40:06,409
I'm sorry.

636
00:40:08,420 --> 00:40:10,423
What you did with Chris...

637
00:40:11,812 --> 00:40:12,816
...it's okay.

638
00:40:14,028 --> 00:40:15,343
It's not.

639
00:40:15,625 --> 00:40:18,068
It can't be. It's too much to forgive.

640
00:40:18,146 --> 00:40:19,693
Well, that's too bad...

641
00:40:20,427 --> 00:40:22,282
because I forgive you.

642
00:40:22,517 --> 00:40:23,701
You can't.

643
00:40:23,829 --> 00:40:25,230
I just did.

644
00:40:27,502 --> 00:40:29,779
So you're gonna just have to deal with it.

645
00:40:32,118 --> 00:40:34,192
I'm the guy for you, Brooke Davis.

646
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:38,080
And I know I hurt you last time we were together, but --

647
00:40:38,165 --> 00:40:39,398
I love you.

648
00:40:43,974 --> 00:40:45,627
I love you, too.

649
00:40:50,197 --> 00:40:51,641
Pretty girl.

650
00:41:11,151 --> 00:41:12,240
I found her.

651
00:41:12,928 --> 00:41:14,197
You happy now?

652
00:41:15,182 --> 00:41:16,221
No.

653
00:41:16,595 --> 00:41:17,925
But you are.

654
00:41:18,443 --> 00:41:19,812
You can wake up now.
