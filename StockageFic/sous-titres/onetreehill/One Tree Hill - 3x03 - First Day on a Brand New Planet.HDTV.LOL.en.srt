1
00:00:01,081 --> 00:00:02,729
Previously on "One Tree Hill"...

2
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:03,948
I'm your mother.

3
00:00:04,082 --> 00:00:05,663
Is this woman my mother?

4
00:00:05,861 --> 00:00:08,141
Your mom is gone, Peyton.

5
00:00:08,203 --> 00:00:11,176
But your biological mother is alive.

6
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:15,473
I saw her buying drugs in the park today. I'm sorry.

7
00:00:15,806 --> 00:00:17,602
You and Erica broke up?

8
00:00:17,865 --> 00:00:19,163
She got popular.

9
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:20,368
I love you.

10
00:00:20,690 --> 00:00:22,799
I really don't know when I'm gonna be ready for us again...

11
00:00:22,861 --> 00:00:25,329
or even if I'll be ready for us at all.

12
00:00:25,411 --> 00:00:28,447
We could totally have a summer-like fling, just in the fall.

13
00:00:28,496 --> 00:00:31,178
And... non-exclusive.

14
00:00:32,333 --> 00:00:34,555
I'm the guy for you, Brooke Davis.

15
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:35,861
You'll see.

16
00:00:36,574 --> 00:00:38,641
Three months ago, someone tried to kill me.

17
00:00:38,687 --> 00:00:42,250
And when I find out who did this to me -- and I will find out soon --

18
00:00:42,471 --> 00:00:45,460
the sins I commit then could turn this place to rubble.

19
00:01:34,823 --> 00:01:37,337
Henry Wadsworth Longfellow wrote,

20
00:01:37,628 --> 00:01:39,821
"All are architects of fate

21
00:01:41,048 --> 00:01:43,246
living in these walls of time."

22
00:02:06,007 --> 00:02:09,854
Looks like we're gonna have to go to Augusta to get in a decent nine holes.

23
00:02:09,906 --> 00:02:13,510
I didn't think you were coming back, so I took the course down.

24
00:02:13,731 --> 00:02:15,553
Didn't feel right letting it fall apart.

25
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:18,092
You were tired of me schooling your sorry butt.

26
00:02:19,434 --> 00:02:20,525
I didn't think you'd remember.

27
00:02:20,571 --> 00:02:22,143
Are you kidding me? Tomorrow's the first day of school.

28
00:02:22,184 --> 00:02:24,652
Every year we predict what the next year is gonna hold,

29
00:02:24,698 --> 00:02:27,800
and every year I realize how out of touch I was with the year before.

30
00:02:28,257 --> 00:02:31,331
Unless this says I'd be married and separated by now.

31
00:02:32,946 --> 00:02:34,369
Well, zero hour.

32
00:02:34,452 --> 00:02:35,399
You first.

33
00:02:36,597 --> 00:02:39,079
"This year I'm going to kiss a boy."

34
00:02:39,141 --> 00:02:41,343
That's mine. It's from seventh grade!

35
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,644
Well, it finally happened for you.

36
00:02:42,673 --> 00:02:43,851
Shut up.

37
00:02:44,231 --> 00:02:45,225
What about you?

38
00:02:45,301 --> 00:02:47,150
"This year I'll talk to Peyton Sawyer."

39
00:02:47,201 --> 00:02:50,068
- It doesn't say that.
- It does. Look at it.

40
00:02:50,555 --> 00:02:51,312
Oh.

41
00:02:52,084 --> 00:02:54,353
"This year I'll volunteer at the tutor center."

42
00:02:55,388 --> 00:02:58,137
"Mom and Keith will finally get married."

43
00:03:01,852 --> 00:03:03,934
"I'll date a musician."

44
00:03:06,293 --> 00:03:07,604
Why do we do this again?

45
00:03:07,671 --> 00:03:09,001
It's supposed to be fun.

46
00:03:09,078 --> 00:03:12,776
How about we wait and see how the first day goes before any predictions?

47
00:03:13,795 --> 00:03:15,438
It's good to have you back, Haley.

48
00:03:16,053 --> 00:03:18,126
Couldn't have done senior year without you.

49
00:03:26,559 --> 00:03:29,576
Okay, I know in high school you always feel like everyone's staring at you,

50
00:03:29,625 --> 00:03:31,003
but this is ridiculous.

51
00:03:31,142 --> 00:03:34,177
They're not used to having a celebrity in their midst.

52
00:03:34,853 --> 00:03:36,113
They'll get over it.

53
00:03:36,337 --> 00:03:38,944
Let's just find our lockers. I'm 141. What are you?

54
00:03:39,036 --> 00:03:42,201
143, so it must be alphabetical.

55
00:03:42,262 --> 00:03:43,690
Which means...

56
00:03:47,193 --> 00:03:48,759
Should've used your stage name.

57
00:03:56,117 --> 00:03:57,662
I waited for you this morning.

58
00:03:58,251 --> 00:03:59,204
What do you mean?

59
00:03:59,808 --> 00:04:03,607
I just figured since it's the first day of school, "the guy for me"

60
00:04:03,668 --> 00:04:07,074
would pick me up, bring me flowers, maybe a bagel.

61
00:04:07,284 --> 00:04:09,653
Just saying -- not that impressive.

62
00:04:10,457 --> 00:04:12,404
I had a couple things to take care of.

63
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:13,300
Hmm.

64
00:04:15,705 --> 00:04:18,045
You totally pimped my locker.

65
00:04:19,851 --> 00:04:20,831
Yep.

66
00:04:21,533 --> 00:04:23,300
It's very exclusive.

67
00:04:30,554 --> 00:04:32,705
Hey, roommate, you were out early this morning.

68
00:04:32,766 --> 00:04:35,982
You know, it's the first day. You have to pace yourself.

69
00:04:36,049 --> 00:04:38,557
I'm one of those people who likes the first day of school.

70
00:04:38,598 --> 00:04:40,365
New pens, new notebook, new backpack.

71
00:04:40,426 --> 00:04:41,283
A nerd.

72
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,818
Exactly.

73
00:04:43,559 --> 00:04:46,325
I'm behind for the first time in my academic career.

74
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:49,585
I'm gonna have to work twice as hard if I want to graduate by june, so...

75
00:04:49,944 --> 00:04:52,822
And everybody here is giving me the zoo treatment, except for Nathan,

76
00:04:52,877 --> 00:04:54,757
who won't barely look at me.

77
00:04:54,824 --> 00:04:57,752
You could always run away and join a rock tour.

78
00:04:57,845 --> 00:05:00,036
Oh, wait, you already did that.

79
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:07,762
She's had a complicated... year. I'll talk to her.

80
00:05:13,829 --> 00:05:15,485
Hey, you got a problem?

81
00:05:23,635 --> 00:05:25,913
Nathan, you think I could get a quick interview?

82
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:28,493
I'm podcasting a preseason "Ravens report."

83
00:05:28,586 --> 00:05:29,707
Podcasting?

84
00:05:29,784 --> 00:05:33,828
It's like radio, but the fans can download it and listen to it on their Ipods.

85
00:05:35,405 --> 00:05:37,971
We're here with number 23, Nathan Scott.

86
00:05:38,022 --> 00:05:40,224
Nate, what's your prediction for this Ravens team?

87
00:05:40,305 --> 00:05:43,797
Is this the year you'll finally claim that elusive championship trophy,

88
00:05:43,837 --> 00:05:46,934
or will it once again end up in the arms of someone else?

89
00:05:47,032 --> 00:05:49,855
Someone more popular, better looking --

90
00:05:49,937 --> 00:05:51,451
possibly a surfer --

91
00:05:51,539 --> 00:05:56,407
leaving  you empty and angry with that final buzzer of regret ringing in your ears?

92
00:06:00,452 --> 00:06:03,709
I think we'll have a great season.

93
00:06:10,244 --> 00:06:11,558
Oh, no.

94
00:06:11,881 --> 00:06:14,425
Sometimes I wish I had gone blind.

95
00:06:14,496 --> 00:06:16,058
Easy, old-timer.

96
00:06:16,283 --> 00:06:20,179
I just came by to congratulate you on your 400th year at Tree Hill High.

97
00:06:22,545 --> 00:06:25,950
Well, I see Nathan ranked nationally.

98
00:06:26,028 --> 00:06:28,434
10 spots ahead of you, if memory serves.

99
00:06:28,505 --> 00:06:30,548
It would have been higher if they'd gone off last year's record

100
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:32,893
instead of his weak play at that damn camp.

101
00:06:32,991 --> 00:06:35,571
Does anything ever make you happy, Danny?

102
00:06:35,863 --> 00:06:37,394
Actually, yeah.

103
00:06:38,658 --> 00:06:40,711
It's the agenda for this week's school board meeting.

104
00:06:40,763 --> 00:06:42,432
Take a look at item three.

105
00:06:42,596 --> 00:06:45,242
I put it in 24-point font so you could read it.

106
00:06:48,939 --> 00:06:51,024
"Replace Whitey Durham."

107
00:06:51,254 --> 00:06:52,718
It's nothing personal.

108
00:06:52,886 --> 00:06:54,500
Wait a minute. Who am I kidding?

109
00:06:54,587 --> 00:06:56,048
Of course it's personal.

110
00:06:56,103 --> 00:06:59,773
It's a shame you didn't burn up along with your dealership.

111
00:07:00,148 --> 00:07:03,721
Of course, Dan Scott can survive anything, can't he?

112
00:07:04,406 --> 00:07:06,487
Like a cockroach.

113
00:07:07,864 --> 00:07:10,388
What's the matter, Danny? I'm just lighting a candle.

114
00:07:10,849 --> 00:07:13,874
Good for the fêng shui.

115
00:07:14,028 --> 00:07:15,989
You look a little skittish.

116
00:07:16,101 --> 00:07:19,527
I thought fire was supposed to be Satan's friend.

117
00:07:20,838 --> 00:07:22,097
It is.

118
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:26,440
If you see Lucas -- that is, if you're still able to --

119
00:07:26,831 --> 00:07:28,502
tell  him I'd like to speak to him.

120
00:07:34,810 --> 00:07:35,824
Lucas.

121
00:07:36,248 --> 00:07:37,201
What do you want?

122
00:07:37,534 --> 00:07:38,727
I need your help.

123
00:07:38,819 --> 00:07:40,530
I'm sorry. I'm fresh out of heroin.

124
00:07:40,596 --> 00:07:41,277
Try the park.

125
00:07:41,354 --> 00:07:42,700
Wait, Lucas,

126
00:07:42,909 --> 00:07:45,049
you did see me buying drugs,

127
00:07:45,132 --> 00:07:46,980
but it was for medical reasons.

128
00:07:47,088 --> 00:07:48,414
Let me guess -- you're going blind.

129
00:07:48,481 --> 00:07:51,332
Actually, no. I have cancer.

130
00:07:51,722 --> 00:07:53,616
I didn't want Peyton to know.

131
00:07:54,861 --> 00:07:57,118
Marijuana helps with the nausea.

132
00:07:57,774 --> 00:07:59,657
How far along?

133
00:07:59,755 --> 00:08:00,903
Far enough.

134
00:08:01,296 --> 00:08:02,346
I'm sorry.

135
00:08:03,831 --> 00:08:06,990
I came back here 'cause I needed to know that Peyton was okay,

136
00:08:07,144 --> 00:08:08,947
that she'd be okay.

137
00:08:09,131 --> 00:08:10,845
She deserves to know.

138
00:08:11,598 --> 00:08:12,698
You have to tell her.

139
00:08:12,771 --> 00:08:16,877
I know, but I want her to get to know me first on her own terms,

140
00:08:16,947 --> 00:08:19,135
not because she feels sorry for me.

141
00:08:20,359 --> 00:08:25,181
I thought maybe you could tell her you made a mistake,

142
00:08:25,329 --> 00:08:28,335
encourage her to give me another chance.

143
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:46,347
Can I help you?

144
00:08:48,901 --> 00:08:49,949
Taking a walk.

145
00:08:50,631 --> 00:08:52,627
Seems I've been doing a lot of that lately.

146
00:08:52,696 --> 00:08:55,378
How about taking a hike? You done that lately?

147
00:08:56,664 --> 00:08:59,429
Did I ever tell you about the dog I found in this park?

148
00:08:59,629 --> 00:09:02,297
I took him into my home and gave him the best of everything.

149
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:04,765
Some might say I even spoiled him.

150
00:09:06,106 --> 00:09:07,514
And then one day...

151
00:09:08,318 --> 00:09:09,308
he bit me.

152
00:09:09,333 --> 00:09:10,877
Oh, he's a smart dog.

153
00:09:12,997 --> 00:09:14,355
Point is...

154
00:09:15,426 --> 00:09:17,717
that dog never bit me again.

155
00:09:21,082 --> 00:09:22,829
I get why you come out here.

156
00:09:24,282 --> 00:09:26,280
Fresh air, solitude.

157
00:09:27,573 --> 00:09:29,090
Gives one clarity.

158
00:09:29,925 --> 00:09:30,979
That's important.

159
00:09:31,569 --> 00:09:35,952
Something I've been trying to grasp at all summer, but it just kept slipping through my fingers

160
00:09:36,534 --> 00:09:40,734
until I saw you the other night at the beach at the bonfire.

161
00:09:42,667 --> 00:09:44,583
I know it was you, Lucas.

162
00:09:46,299 --> 00:09:47,727
I don't know what you're talking about.

163
00:09:47,779 --> 00:09:49,965
I saw you at the dealership that night.

164
00:09:50,993 --> 00:09:52,611
You think I wouldn't remember?

165
00:09:55,807 --> 00:09:57,389
Careful, now.

166
00:09:57,487 --> 00:09:59,216
Don't want to get that heart rate up,

167
00:09:59,292 --> 00:10:01,561
especially since you stopped taking your meds.

168
00:10:01,627 --> 00:10:05,192
It'd be a shame if you collapsed on the court and no one to call an ambulance.

169
00:10:06,407 --> 00:10:08,078
Thanks for your concern...

170
00:10:09,584 --> 00:10:10,511
...dad.

171
00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:15,042
I didn't raise you, so maybe you didn't get the lesson.

172
00:10:15,186 --> 00:10:18,892
If you're gonna start something, you sure as hell better finish it.

173
00:10:21,816 --> 00:10:24,494
I'm not playing this game anymore.

174
00:10:31,483 --> 00:10:32,711
Good talk, son.

175
00:10:33,162 --> 00:10:34,734
We'll finish it soon.

176
00:10:44,964 --> 00:10:47,274
What are you doing on this side of the school?

177
00:10:47,339 --> 00:10:50,084
- Going to P.E.
- Oh, what -- by way of Florida?

178
00:10:50,146 --> 00:10:51,588
You're dodging Haley.

179
00:10:51,701 --> 00:10:53,755
How'd you deal with it when we first broke up,

180
00:10:53,817 --> 00:10:56,242
aside from immediately trying to hook up with Lucas?

181
00:10:57,237 --> 00:11:01,313
No, seriously. How did you deal with having to see each other every day?

182
00:11:01,522 --> 00:11:05,536
Really, the only thing I missed was skipping algebra and making out in my car.

183
00:11:05,638 --> 00:11:08,270
As  much as I loathed kissing you, algebra was worse.

184
00:11:08,347 --> 00:11:11,931
Do you have any idea how annoying it is to only go to your locker once a day?

185
00:11:11,992 --> 00:11:13,355
I'm gonna need a chiropractor.

186
00:11:13,405 --> 00:11:15,367
Let's talk about something happy,

187
00:11:15,434 --> 00:11:18,075
like how we're gonna get evicted if we don't find money for rent.

188
00:11:18,121 --> 00:11:20,240
Wait a minute, I thought your parents sent you money.

189
00:11:20,302 --> 00:11:23,071
Well, it barely covered my back-to-school wardrobe.

190
00:11:23,139 --> 00:11:25,182
You spent your rent money on clothes?

191
00:11:25,243 --> 00:11:28,638
I can't come to school naked. It wouldn't be very presidential.

192
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:31,295
Although I would never have to worry out re-election.

193
00:11:31,351 --> 00:11:33,845
Oh, my god, it's so good that you're not treasurer.

194
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:36,472
By the way, have you talked to Peyton?

195
00:11:36,928 --> 00:11:41,484
I get why Nathan's freezing me out, but it's not like I put Peyton up for adoption.

196
00:11:42,139 --> 00:11:45,125
Star forward Nathan Scott and wife, Haley, face to face.

197
00:11:45,175 --> 00:11:46,650
How will her return affect his game?

198
00:11:46,708 --> 00:11:51,566
Will she destroy his average like Erica Marsh threatens to destroy this reporter's GPA?

199
00:12:03,855 --> 00:12:06,941
I don't care how many board members got their cars at cost.

200
00:12:06,992 --> 00:12:10,269
40 years of coaching should count for more than that.

201
00:12:12,422 --> 00:12:13,873
Hey, coach.

202
00:12:13,911 --> 00:12:16,638
Well, well, Avril Lavigne.

203
00:12:16,714 --> 00:12:18,235
What can I do for you?

204
00:12:18,309 --> 00:12:20,484
I wanted to talk to you about Nathan.

205
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:24,046
I'm not exactly his favorite person right now.

206
00:12:24,124 --> 00:12:25,937
And you'd like for me to talk to him.

207
00:12:26,039 --> 00:12:28,650
I was hoping. He really listens to you.

208
00:12:28,731 --> 00:12:32,992
Listen, girlie, I'm a basketball coach, not Dr. Phil.

209
00:12:33,093 --> 00:12:36,928
I don't have time for anybody else's problems right now. I've got plenty of my own.

210
00:12:37,005 --> 00:12:37,902
I understand.

211
00:12:37,983 --> 00:12:42,039
Besides that, I should be happy that my star player's focusing on the game

212
00:12:42,085 --> 00:12:43,810
rather than on his love life.

213
00:12:43,877 --> 00:12:46,627
We got a championship to win this year.

214
00:12:46,858 --> 00:12:47,820
Here.

215
00:12:48,009 --> 00:12:48,900
What's this?

216
00:12:48,937 --> 00:12:50,640
It's called a detention slip.

217
00:12:50,702 --> 00:12:51,931
Detention  for what?!

218
00:12:51,986 --> 00:12:55,300
Last time I checked, this was the boys' locker room.

219
00:12:55,412 --> 00:12:56,953
Now, take it and go.

220
00:13:03,153 --> 00:13:06,579
So, how is, uh, everything going with Peyton and Ellie?

221
00:13:06,728 --> 00:13:08,970
I don't know. I told Ellie to stay away.

222
00:13:09,471 --> 00:13:13,000
But part of me thinks it might be good for those two to talk.

223
00:13:13,041 --> 00:13:14,664
How much do you know about her?

224
00:13:14,731 --> 00:13:15,954
Not much, really.

225
00:13:16,051 --> 00:13:19,246
We met her when she was pregnant with Peyton, looking for an adoptive couple.

226
00:13:19,304 --> 00:13:20,521
She chose us.

227
00:13:20,972 --> 00:13:24,612
What about Peyton's father -- uh, biological father?

228
00:13:24,658 --> 00:13:27,920
We asked about him, but she would never talk about him.

229
00:13:27,976 --> 00:13:29,350
I don't know, Karen.

230
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:33,235
Half the time I'm floating in the Atlantic, trying to keep a roof over our heads,

231
00:13:33,301 --> 00:13:37,544
and Peyton is scratching her way through adolescence alone.

232
00:13:37,602 --> 00:13:39,834
Peyton  knows that you love her, Larry.

233
00:13:40,146 --> 00:13:41,370
I know she does.

234
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:44,743
I just don't want to see her hurt again.

235
00:13:44,857 --> 00:13:48,723
You know, I don't know Ellie. I don't know her intentions,

236
00:13:48,834 --> 00:13:52,828
but this may be the one opportunity that Peyton has to find out.

237
00:13:53,802 --> 00:13:59,312
I know you want to protect her, but maybe what she needs protection from is regret.

238
00:14:02,344 --> 00:14:05,307
Coach Durham, if I said something to upset you earlier, I'm really sorry.

239
00:14:05,313 --> 00:14:06,690
Take your seat.

240
00:14:09,771 --> 00:14:11,364
What are you doing here?

241
00:14:11,588 --> 00:14:13,677
She's got detention, just like you.

242
00:14:13,734 --> 00:14:15,971
Are we the only two people that got in trouble today?

243
00:14:18,034 --> 00:14:19,463
Get lost, kid.

244
00:14:20,589 --> 00:14:21,865
You're pardoned.

245
00:14:28,072 --> 00:14:30,856
Today, we're gonna allow talking.

246
00:14:31,699 --> 00:14:34,726
I believe you two have some catching up to do.

247
00:14:42,602 --> 00:14:44,127
So, how'd detention go?

248
00:14:44,178 --> 00:14:46,963
It was what it was supposed to be -- punishment.

249
00:14:47,034 --> 00:14:49,385
Nathan looked at me exactly once when my stomach growled funny

250
00:14:49,446 --> 00:14:51,894
and then stared at the clock for the rest of the hour.

251
00:14:52,068 --> 00:14:54,071
Gave you time to work on those predictions, right?

252
00:14:54,136 --> 00:14:57,787
Are you kidding me? The way this year's going, I predict I'm gonna get my G.E.D.

253
00:14:58,585 --> 00:15:00,358
- See you at lunch.
- All right.

254
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:09,910
Excuse me. Um, aren't you Kelly Clarkson?

255
00:15:10,101 --> 00:15:11,130
Bitch.

256
00:15:12,450 --> 00:15:14,378
You want to try saying that to my face?

257
00:15:14,442 --> 00:15:16,511
You like to sing about stars?

258
00:15:16,567 --> 00:15:18,046
Maybe you'd like to see some.

259
00:15:18,272 --> 00:15:19,945
I have never done anything to you!

260
00:15:20,015 --> 00:15:22,568
Hey, hey, hey! Break it up, now!

261
00:15:22,691 --> 00:15:25,506
I'm not gonna have any catfights on my watch.

262
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:29,040
Fighting at school? That's a detention.

263
00:15:29,102 --> 00:15:30,365
Coach, she started it!

264
00:15:30,421 --> 00:15:33,689
Talking back to a teacher? That's two.

265
00:15:33,791 --> 00:15:35,613
Whitey, I really appreciate it, but I don't think --

266
00:15:35,665 --> 00:15:38,287
Calling me "Whitey" is three.

267
00:15:38,353 --> 00:15:39,603
Okay, I think two's enough.

268
00:15:39,684 --> 00:15:43,427
I'm serious about that third one. I'll see you in detention.

269
00:15:59,079 --> 00:16:02,703
You really, uh, knock out Sue Garvey's front tooth?

270
00:16:03,544 --> 00:16:06,063
W-what? Where did you hear that?

271
00:16:06,129 --> 00:16:07,619
It's all over school.

272
00:16:07,732 --> 00:16:11,474
Great. Add "bully" to my résumé now. Ugh.

273
00:16:12,023 --> 00:16:15,244
You know, I played for some tough crowds on the road.

274
00:16:15,325 --> 00:16:19,099
Nothing compares to the hostility I feel walking down that hallway.

275
00:16:19,355 --> 00:16:22,815
What did I even do to make those girls hate me anyway? They don't even know me.

276
00:16:22,876 --> 00:16:25,325
It's high school. They don't need a reason.

277
00:16:26,026 --> 00:16:28,397
Try missing the winning shot at a home game.

278
00:16:28,473 --> 00:16:30,802
You'll feel hatred at a whole new level.

279
00:16:32,735 --> 00:16:35,857
Yeah, I guess I never thought of it that way.

280
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,025
Nathan --

281
00:16:42,031 --> 00:16:43,752
I should get back to this.

282
00:16:44,130 --> 00:16:45,666
I don't have a tutor anymore.

283
00:16:57,478 --> 00:16:58,491
Let me guess.

284
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,452
Mom's not home. She doesn't know you're here.

285
00:17:00,504 --> 00:17:02,752
Well technically, we haven't divided our assets yet.

286
00:17:02,808 --> 00:17:06,115
Technically, hanging around when your wife's kicked you to the curb makes you a loser.

287
00:17:06,178 --> 00:17:07,661
I guess you'd know, right?

288
00:17:08,191 --> 00:17:10,437
Come on, get suited up. We'll play one-on-one.

289
00:17:10,519 --> 00:17:11,599
Where you been anyway?

290
00:17:12,735 --> 00:17:14,072
I had detention.

291
00:17:14,661 --> 00:17:17,077
Nathan, you can't afford to be a discipline case.

292
00:17:17,139 --> 00:17:18,629
This stuff gets back to the scouts.

293
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:22,244
It wasn't like that. Whitey's just playing games with me and Haley.

294
00:17:22,704 --> 00:17:23,872
Whitey, huh?

295
00:17:24,215 --> 00:17:26,447
Well, you won't have to worry about him much longer.

296
00:17:26,509 --> 00:17:27,677
What does that mean?

297
00:17:28,070 --> 00:17:29,725
I'm looking out for you, son.

298
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:32,325
I'm going before the school board tonight.

299
00:17:32,397 --> 00:17:34,097
We're gonna get you a real coach.

300
00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:36,252
Swish!

301
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:40,194
I'm only saying maybe I was wrong about Ellie.

302
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:43,656
Who knows what I saw. Could've been any number of things.

303
00:17:43,711 --> 00:17:46,472
Crack, speed? Maybe model-airplane glue.

304
00:17:46,538 --> 00:17:47,558
That's not what I mean.

305
00:17:47,561 --> 00:17:50,250
Lucas, I confronted her about it. She didn't deny it.

306
00:17:50,317 --> 00:17:51,740
There could be some explanation.

307
00:17:51,797 --> 00:17:54,951
There's always an explanation with her -- it's called lying.

308
00:17:55,017 --> 00:17:57,260
Why are you on the Ellie train all of a sudden anyway?

309
00:17:57,326 --> 00:17:58,729
I'm not.

310
00:17:58,827 --> 00:18:01,909
I'm just saying maybe you should give her a chance.

311
00:18:07,007 --> 00:18:07,951
Hey.

312
00:18:08,324 --> 00:18:09,804
Hi, Peyton.

313
00:18:10,019 --> 00:18:11,288
What are you doing here?

314
00:18:11,348 --> 00:18:15,568
I invited her. I-I thought maybe we could all talk.

315
00:18:15,819 --> 00:18:17,796
I had no idea how gifted you were.

316
00:18:17,852 --> 00:18:19,239
You set me up.

317
00:18:19,338 --> 00:18:21,835
Peyton, wait, wait. Listen.

318
00:18:21,902 --> 00:18:25,904
No, you listen! This is my world, okay? That's my music.

319
00:18:25,993 --> 00:18:29,717
This is my art, art that has everything to do with mom --

320
00:18:29,874 --> 00:18:31,359
my real mom, okay?

321
00:18:31,426 --> 00:18:33,771
I can't believe you would do this to me.

322
00:18:35,662 --> 00:18:37,718
Did you know about this?

323
00:18:37,923 --> 00:18:38,870
Peyton.

324
00:18:38,947 --> 00:18:42,096
No, just -- just stay out of my life, okay?

325
00:18:42,198 --> 00:18:43,427
All of you.

326
00:18:45,261 --> 00:18:46,586
It's my fault.

327
00:18:56,110 --> 00:19:00,165
Good news. Our money troubles are over. I am a working girl.

328
00:19:00,221 --> 00:19:01,311
Is that legal?

329
00:19:01,389 --> 00:19:05,341
I am now the newest employee at Suburban Filth. It's a clothing store.

330
00:19:05,387 --> 00:19:09,221
"Suburban Filth." That's... perfect.

331
00:19:10,665 --> 00:19:11,654
What have you got there?

332
00:19:11,729 --> 00:19:15,997
These, my dear roommate, are hair scrunchies circa 1995,

333
00:19:16,042 --> 00:19:18,985
and they are going to make this living arrangement bearable.

334
00:19:19,037 --> 00:19:21,606
Brooke, I know you never liked my hair, but it's just --

335
00:19:21,659 --> 00:19:25,319
No. Well, true, but no.

336
00:19:25,376 --> 00:19:29,871
When either of us has a boy over, these scrunchies will be our first line of defense.

337
00:19:29,913 --> 00:19:33,717
Observe. Red scrunchie means "occupied."

338
00:19:33,773 --> 00:19:35,719
Some serious action going on in here.

339
00:19:35,775 --> 00:19:40,645
The yellow scrunchie means we're making out, but one of us may be topless.

340
00:19:40,701 --> 00:19:41,792
And the black one?

341
00:19:41,848 --> 00:19:44,243
Hmm... you're gonna have to leave the apartment.

342
00:19:44,356 --> 00:19:46,804
I'm not sure I can handle thinking of you and Lucas

343
00:19:46,859 --> 00:19:49,199
hooking up in the same room where I'm sleeping.

344
00:19:49,235 --> 00:19:51,304
Lucas and/or others.

345
00:19:51,381 --> 00:19:54,094
Brooke, it's a -- it's a really good system.

346
00:19:54,146 --> 00:19:58,878
I just don't think I'm gonna be needing any scrunchies any time soon, so...

347
00:19:58,943 --> 00:20:01,918
Oh, no, no, roommate, come here.

348
00:20:02,496 --> 00:20:03,685
Come on.

349
00:20:04,248 --> 00:20:06,290
Nathan's gonna come around.

350
00:20:06,394 --> 00:20:09,424
He just needs to know you're here for the long haul.

351
00:20:14,365 --> 00:20:15,660
You know...

352
00:20:17,796 --> 00:20:21,589
sometimes people play hard to get because they need to know

353
00:20:21,841 --> 00:20:23,985
the other person's feelings are real.

354
00:20:36,119 --> 00:20:38,506
Oh, Nathan. It's been a long time.

355
00:20:38,607 --> 00:20:39,432
Yeah.

356
00:20:39,535 --> 00:20:40,641
Have you seen Lucas?

357
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:42,705
Oh, not for a few hours.

358
00:20:43,134 --> 00:20:44,700
Okay. Thanks.

359
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:46,335
Nathan.

360
00:20:48,951 --> 00:20:50,145
Haley came back.

361
00:20:51,751 --> 00:20:52,535
Yeah.

362
00:20:54,624 --> 00:20:58,383
Do you, uh, do you remember that day on the River Court

363
00:20:58,454 --> 00:21:01,060
when you told me you would give anything to have her home?

364
00:21:01,357 --> 00:21:02,160
Yeah.

365
00:21:02,247 --> 00:21:03,609
Yeah, you told me to have faith.

366
00:21:03,696 --> 00:21:08,038
Yeah, well, faith is believing when there's nothing else you can do.

367
00:21:09,333 --> 00:21:10,738
She's here now.

368
00:21:12,902 --> 00:21:14,341
What  are you gonna do about it?

369
00:21:16,051 --> 00:21:17,085
Haley's here.

370
00:21:17,157 --> 00:21:20,823
Just don't know if the guy she left is ever gonna come back.

371
00:21:24,792 --> 00:21:27,059
Oh, and if you see Lucas,

372
00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:29,625
tell him he might want to come to the school board meeting tonight.

373
00:21:29,651 --> 00:21:31,034
School board?

374
00:21:31,043 --> 00:21:31,745
Yeah.

375
00:21:31,805 --> 00:21:34,414
My dad's trying to get Whitey fired, and, uh,

376
00:21:34,694 --> 00:21:37,007
we both know he usually gets what he wants.

377
00:22:04,259 --> 00:22:05,635
I thought you might be here.

378
00:22:08,501 --> 00:22:12,279
Ever since your mom died, I've been guessing a lot.

379
00:22:12,827 --> 00:22:14,610
Sometimes I guess wrong.

380
00:22:16,806 --> 00:22:21,123
I shouldn't have brought Ellie into your room without asking.

381
00:22:22,565 --> 00:22:25,127
But she didn't have anything to do with it.

382
00:22:25,218 --> 00:22:26,580
Neither did Lucas.

383
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:31,475
Sometimes you guess right.

384
00:22:33,703 --> 00:22:35,633
You guessed where to find me.

385
00:22:43,548 --> 00:22:46,073
This has all been a lot to take.

386
00:22:49,313 --> 00:22:52,053
I want you to know you can always talk to me.

387
00:22:52,655 --> 00:22:54,520
But sometimes I can't, dad.

388
00:22:55,313 --> 00:22:56,819
Yeah, I get that.

389
00:22:58,514 --> 00:23:02,661
If you're not always comfortable talking with me, maybe we should find you someone.

390
00:23:04,382 --> 00:23:06,025
Like a shrink?

391
00:23:06,436 --> 00:23:08,662
Might help you to get some of this out.

392
00:23:23,279 --> 00:23:26,972
Just beyond these doors, coach Durham's fate is being decided as we speak.

393
00:23:27,044 --> 00:23:28,405
The tension is palpable.

394
00:23:28,457 --> 00:23:31,297
The only audible sounds are the heartbeats of this Ravens team

395
00:23:31,349 --> 00:23:33,914
beating in unison for its beloved coach.

396
00:23:33,976 --> 00:23:36,419
My heart would be beating, too, but it's been ripped out

397
00:23:36,459 --> 00:23:38,477
and stomped on by one Erica Marsh.

398
00:23:38,533 --> 00:23:39,541
Mouth...

399
00:23:40,585 --> 00:23:41,923
got a second?

400
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:47,686
Look...

401
00:23:47,805 --> 00:23:49,972
I know what you're going through, man, but at a certain point

402
00:23:50,022 --> 00:23:52,423
you got to stop wearing your heart on your sleeves.

403
00:23:52,899 --> 00:23:55,362
In fact, your whole shirt's getting a little ripe.

404
00:23:55,423 --> 00:23:57,497
That's easy for you to say, Luke.

405
00:23:57,773 --> 00:24:02,321
You get your heart broken and there's a dozen girls waiting to put it back together.

406
00:24:02,408 --> 00:24:04,538
It doesn't work like that for me.

407
00:24:04,951 --> 00:24:08,485
And even if it did, I don't want it to.

408
00:24:10,037 --> 00:24:11,982
I just want Erica back.

409
00:24:15,381 --> 00:24:20,558
To the school board, concerned parents, Mr. Mayor,

410
00:24:20,636 --> 00:24:23,641
I think coach Durham's record speaks for itself.

411
00:24:24,179 --> 00:24:26,195
He's never won a State title.

412
00:24:26,533 --> 00:24:30,333
In fact, the closest he ever came were those years where myself and my sons were on the team.

413
00:24:30,390 --> 00:24:31,763
Now, let's face it.

414
00:24:32,011 --> 00:24:34,480
Whitey's running out of my DNA.

415
00:24:37,424 --> 00:24:39,722
This is Nathan's final year at Tree Hill,

416
00:24:39,795 --> 00:24:41,816
and a lot of the other boys, too.

417
00:24:42,186 --> 00:24:45,135
We may not have another chance like this for decades.

418
00:24:45,211 --> 00:24:46,840
Now, I love Whitey.

419
00:24:47,387 --> 00:24:49,712
He's an institution in this town,

420
00:24:50,009 --> 00:24:51,959
but this is bigger than just one man.

421
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:53,619
This is about civic pride.

422
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:56,690
This is about driving into Tree Hill in the middle of the night

423
00:24:56,762 --> 00:24:59,444
and seeing your headlights splash that sign --

424
00:24:59,532 --> 00:25:01,960
"welcome to Tree Hill, home of the Ravens,

425
00:25:02,041 --> 00:25:05,041
North Carolina State Basketball Champions."

426
00:25:05,256 --> 00:25:07,329
It gives me chills just thinking about it.

427
00:25:08,262 --> 00:25:10,838
And our kids deserve to have that feeling, too.

428
00:25:10,929 --> 00:25:13,056
Hell, so does all of Tree Hill.

429
00:25:13,202 --> 00:25:18,431
Now, if we make the change by replacing coach Durham, we can get there this year.

430
00:25:18,738 --> 00:25:20,612
I honestly believe that.

431
00:25:21,061 --> 00:25:22,096
Thank you.

432
00:25:24,103 --> 00:25:26,996
Well... thank you, Mr. Scott.

433
00:25:28,652 --> 00:25:30,718
Time to call this to a vote.

434
00:25:31,245 --> 00:25:33,114
I would like to say something.

435
00:25:34,818 --> 00:25:38,293
Uh, Mayor Mullins, Ms. Roe is not a member of the school board.

436
00:25:38,344 --> 00:25:40,682
I don't think I've ever seen her at a meeting before.

437
00:25:40,754 --> 00:25:41,818
I object.

438
00:25:41,972 --> 00:25:44,153
Well, this is not a court of law, Dan.

439
00:25:44,221 --> 00:25:46,154
We go by my rules.

440
00:25:46,615 --> 00:25:47,712
Sit down.

441
00:25:51,665 --> 00:25:53,697
Please go ahead, Ms. Roe.

442
00:25:54,685 --> 00:25:55,535
Thank you.

443
00:25:56,118 --> 00:25:59,221
Most of you know me. I am Lucas Scott's mom.

444
00:25:59,278 --> 00:26:04,244
I run a café downtown, and Lucas joined the Ravens last year.

445
00:26:04,321 --> 00:26:07,520
What you don't know is that I was against it.

446
00:26:07,594 --> 00:26:10,681
Whitey knew that, but he recruited him anyway.

447
00:26:11,033 --> 00:26:15,810
Um... I was against it for good reason.

448
00:26:16,149 --> 00:26:19,840
Because I have seen what this game can turn people into,

449
00:26:19,922 --> 00:26:22,942
and I was worried that that would happen to my son.

450
00:26:23,265 --> 00:26:29,977
What I didn't realize is how what Whitey teaches these boys goes beyond the simple game.

451
00:26:30,428 --> 00:26:35,370
I have seen his influence in my own son beyond the x's and the o's,

452
00:26:35,416 --> 00:26:38,661
and so have all the other parents in this room.

453
00:26:38,753 --> 00:26:41,482
Our boys are becoming men,

454
00:26:41,584 --> 00:26:45,466
and I cannot put that into statistics.

455
00:26:45,527 --> 00:26:48,420
It may not translate into championships.

456
00:26:48,491 --> 00:26:52,050
But if you put too much focus on those things,

457
00:26:52,572 --> 00:26:56,438
in the end, all you're gonna end up with is a sad bunch of boys

458
00:26:56,479 --> 00:27:00,769
who never learned to leave the game behind.

459
00:27:01,043 --> 00:27:06,069
Unlike Dan Scott, I don't believe that our sons deserve anything.

460
00:27:06,145 --> 00:27:08,040
You get what you earn.

461
00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:11,552
But coach Durham --

462
00:27:11,747 --> 00:27:13,646
he deserves better.

463
00:27:14,379 --> 00:27:16,606
He's already earned it.

464
00:27:27,830 --> 00:27:29,591
So, my mom told me you came looking for me.

465
00:27:29,637 --> 00:27:31,018
Oh, it wasn't about you.

466
00:27:31,069 --> 00:27:32,600
Just wanted to make sure everybody knew about Whitey.

467
00:27:32,647 --> 00:27:35,141
So you do care about something besides basketball.

468
00:27:35,176 --> 00:27:38,008
Whitey gets me touches. He knows it's my team.

469
00:27:38,063 --> 00:27:40,153
Pretty soon the scouts will, too.

470
00:27:40,332 --> 00:27:41,811
Your team, huh?

471
00:27:42,744 --> 00:27:45,795
I guess we'll see about that when we get back on the court, won't we?

472
00:27:48,268 --> 00:27:49,456
- Hey.
- Hi.

473
00:27:49,513 --> 00:27:51,892
Listen, about earlier, I-I'm sorry. I didn't know that she --

474
00:27:51,939 --> 00:27:54,807
I know. My dad told me you weren't on the grassy knoll.

475
00:27:55,462 --> 00:27:56,993
Luke, I'm sorry.

476
00:27:57,049 --> 00:28:00,541
You're one of the few people that's been honest with me through this whole thing.

477
00:28:01,186 --> 00:28:02,886
So, what are you doing after this?

478
00:28:14,569 --> 00:28:16,464
Bad news, gentlemen.

479
00:28:18,298 --> 00:28:20,089
You're stuck with me.

480
00:28:36,006 --> 00:28:38,434
We're going all the way this season!

481
00:28:42,807 --> 00:28:45,371
Been a while since we've been in here, huh?

482
00:28:45,731 --> 00:28:47,339
I'm in here every night.

483
00:28:47,871 --> 00:28:49,300
In my mind, anyway.

484
00:28:49,442 --> 00:28:51,406
Replaying the shot you missed,

485
00:28:51,747 --> 00:28:53,698
the shot that ended our season,

486
00:28:53,784 --> 00:28:56,482
the shot you've probably made, what -- a thousand times?

487
00:28:56,505 --> 00:28:57,583
Okay.

488
00:28:59,073 --> 00:29:00,604
So, what do you have to tell me?

489
00:29:02,832 --> 00:29:04,005
How'd you know?

490
00:29:04,239 --> 00:29:07,348
Well, I figured you either brought me in here to talk,

491
00:29:07,398 --> 00:29:11,069
to make out, or to kill me. And since we're not gonna make out,

492
00:29:11,131 --> 00:29:13,521
I guess it's talk or die, right?

493
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:15,043
Is it bad?

494
00:29:15,534 --> 00:29:16,574
Yeah.

495
00:29:16,835 --> 00:29:19,712
Let me guess -- I've got three moms.

496
00:29:22,599 --> 00:29:24,535
Ellie was buying marijuana,

497
00:29:24,587 --> 00:29:26,398
but not for the reasons you think.

498
00:29:26,466 --> 00:29:27,772
She's sick.

499
00:29:28,688 --> 00:29:30,640
She has cancer, Peyton.

500
00:29:30,945 --> 00:29:32,456
She told you that.

501
00:29:33,950 --> 00:29:36,649
Come on, Luke, that's just another one of her lies.

502
00:29:36,706 --> 00:29:38,252
I don't think so.

503
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:41,202
I think she was afraid that if you knew the truth,

504
00:29:41,273 --> 00:29:43,695
you'd feel obligated to her some way --

505
00:29:43,766 --> 00:29:46,489
that it would change things between you for the wrong reasons.

506
00:29:46,567 --> 00:29:50,621
Kind of like your little secret about Dan and the fire.

507
00:29:51,103 --> 00:29:53,534
And what little secret is that?

508
00:29:54,313 --> 00:29:57,739
Sorry to interrupt your little melodrama, but Lucas and I have unfinished business.

509
00:29:57,806 --> 00:29:59,255
Peyton, you should go.

510
00:29:59,910 --> 00:30:01,211
Yeah, we'll both go.

511
00:30:01,328 --> 00:30:05,046
A bit oedipal, don't you think -- trying to kill daddy?

512
00:30:05,276 --> 00:30:07,819
Someone should tell mom she's in for some action.

513
00:30:07,888 --> 00:30:09,890
You don't know what happened that night.

514
00:30:12,762 --> 00:30:15,485
You can't remember, and it's killing you.

515
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:16,774
Enlighten me.

516
00:30:16,827 --> 00:30:18,500
- Let go! 
- Leave him alone!

517
00:30:18,553 --> 00:30:21,086
This is a family matter. You'd understand if you had one.

518
00:30:21,209 --> 00:30:22,171
You son of a bitch!

519
00:30:26,155 --> 00:30:28,875
My record on this court's better than yours, Lucas.

520
00:30:31,009 --> 00:30:32,668
You really think you can try to kill me?!

521
00:30:32,728 --> 00:30:34,260
- Stop it!
- You think you can get away with this?!

522
00:30:34,311 --> 00:30:35,212
Let go!

523
00:30:35,298 --> 00:30:36,805
There are easier ways to kill a man.

524
00:30:36,841 --> 00:30:38,259
He wasn't trying to kill you!

525
00:30:38,309 --> 00:30:41,336
- Like choking!
- He saved your life!

526
00:30:52,638 --> 00:30:55,083
Lucas, please, you have to tell him.

527
00:30:57,722 --> 00:30:59,567
I was there...

528
00:31:00,409 --> 00:31:02,364
but not to kill you.

529
00:31:57,770 --> 00:32:00,942
I saved your life.

530
00:32:02,002 --> 00:32:04,374
But I should've let you burn.

531
00:32:13,695 --> 00:32:16,051
Well, a stronger man would've.

532
00:32:19,307 --> 00:32:21,284
This will be our secret, Lucas.

533
00:32:21,439 --> 00:32:23,486
That goes for you, too, miss Sawyer.

534
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:39,138
Luke, I'm sorry. I had to tell him.

535
00:32:40,287 --> 00:32:42,054
It's all right. I know.

536
00:32:42,317 --> 00:32:43,946
Are you okay?

537
00:32:46,365 --> 00:32:48,009
That's my father.

538
00:32:48,703 --> 00:32:50,724
What do you think?

539
00:33:10,006 --> 00:33:12,566
If I were you, I'd keep those boxes packed.

540
00:33:13,345 --> 00:33:14,564
What are you still doing here?

541
00:33:14,650 --> 00:33:16,662
You mean other than paying the bills?

542
00:33:18,174 --> 00:33:19,853
It's over, dad.

543
00:33:20,257 --> 00:33:21,383
Let it go.

544
00:33:25,141 --> 00:33:28,018
Can't blame a guy for trying to hold on, can you?

545
00:33:41,772 --> 00:33:43,906
I hear this place is open all night.

546
00:33:44,234 --> 00:33:45,647
You heard right.

547
00:33:45,887 --> 00:33:47,086
Okay, thanks.

548
00:33:47,444 --> 00:33:50,378
And now that I have a new job, we eat, too.

549
00:33:50,411 --> 00:33:51,607
Pizza's on the way.

550
00:33:51,694 --> 00:33:53,276
I'm gonna change. You guys hang.

551
00:33:54,192 --> 00:33:55,381
What happened to you?

552
00:33:55,774 --> 00:33:59,133
Oh, this pickup game got a little rough.

553
00:33:59,742 --> 00:34:00,839
What are you doing?

554
00:34:01,396 --> 00:34:06,470
Ugh. I'm looking through this list of predictions and dreams and wishes I made over the years.

555
00:34:06,507 --> 00:34:09,415
I really think maybe back then I was a better person.

556
00:34:09,481 --> 00:34:11,709
You're the same person you've always been,

557
00:34:11,815 --> 00:34:13,806
but that's not a list of who you are.

558
00:34:13,879 --> 00:34:16,710
That's a list of who you're gonna be,

559
00:34:16,792 --> 00:34:18,596
and that's still up to you.

560
00:34:19,392 --> 00:34:23,939
Yeah. Well, whatever I want to happen this year, I'm gonna predict the opposite

561
00:34:23,981 --> 00:34:27,359
'cause life always has a way of figuring out how to surprise you.

562
00:34:29,061 --> 00:34:30,360
That was fast.

563
00:34:31,528 --> 00:34:33,330
You pitching in, you mooch?

564
00:34:37,170 --> 00:34:38,399
Hey.

565
00:34:39,270 --> 00:34:40,554
Nice place.

566
00:34:41,117 --> 00:34:42,259
Can I talk to you?

567
00:34:43,262 --> 00:34:44,220
Yeah.

568
00:34:52,222 --> 00:34:53,897
I'm glad it was you that stopped by.

569
00:34:53,959 --> 00:34:57,533
Living with Brooke, you never know who's gonna come in for a late-night booty call.

570
00:34:59,134 --> 00:35:03,430
Look, um, I've been doing some thinking about us,

571
00:35:03,836 --> 00:35:06,406
about what we're gonna do, and, um,

572
00:35:06,947 --> 00:35:08,950
I still have the annulment papers.

573
00:35:09,079 --> 00:35:12,718
But if we get an annulment, that means that our marriage never happened

574
00:35:13,282 --> 00:35:14,547
and that'd be a lie.

575
00:35:15,996 --> 00:35:18,223
And we had a lot of great times together, Haley.

576
00:35:18,289 --> 00:35:20,019
I don't want to pretend like we didn't.

577
00:35:21,045 --> 00:35:22,278
Neither do I.

578
00:35:24,546 --> 00:35:29,007
So, instead of an annulment, I've looked into a divorce.

579
00:35:34,127 --> 00:35:37,285
The State says we'd have to be separated for a year.

580
00:35:38,028 --> 00:35:38,908
What --

581
00:35:40,684 --> 00:35:42,568
uh, what are you saying?

582
00:35:42,646 --> 00:35:44,437
I'm saying that I --

583
00:35:45,508 --> 00:35:48,339
I think we should see what happens between now and then.

584
00:35:48,836 --> 00:35:51,781
Nathan... I love you.

585
00:35:53,346 --> 00:35:58,446
I know that we can work this out, and a year from now, things will be good for us again.

586
00:35:58,549 --> 00:35:59,516
Maybe...

587
00:36:00,074 --> 00:36:01,179
or maybe not.

588
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:05,281
I guess we'll just have to see.

589
00:36:15,095 --> 00:36:16,412
I should probably go.

590
00:36:17,267 --> 00:36:20,713
What, you're just gonna eat Haley's half of the pizza and then run?

591
00:36:20,943 --> 00:36:25,506
Let's be optimistic. Nathan and Haley have a lot of problems.

592
00:36:25,562 --> 00:36:28,233
They'll probably be out all night,

593
00:36:28,864 --> 00:36:31,256
and you know I hate to sleep alone.

594
00:36:33,209 --> 00:36:35,944
I would love to spend the night, Brooke.

595
00:36:36,007 --> 00:36:37,036
Yeah?

596
00:36:38,095 --> 00:36:39,494
Yeah...

597
00:36:40,097 --> 00:36:41,950
as soon as we're exclusive.

598
00:36:42,028 --> 00:36:43,425
Oh, you're good.

599
00:36:43,943 --> 00:36:51,474
But before you go, did I mention that one of the perks of my new job

600
00:36:51,679 --> 00:36:55,110
is that I get to take home free samples?

601
00:36:58,279 --> 00:36:59,027
Hmm?

602
00:37:00,721 --> 00:37:02,195
You're better.

603
00:37:02,616 --> 00:37:04,028
Much better.

604
00:37:04,898 --> 00:37:06,854
So are we staying yet?

605
00:37:09,210 --> 00:37:11,344
Are we exclusive yet?

606
00:37:16,297 --> 00:37:18,380
Game on, Brooke Davis.

607
00:37:27,636 --> 00:37:29,465
Well, that's a first.

608
00:37:37,114 --> 00:37:40,919
Mouth McFadden, newsman extraordinaire.

609
00:37:40,985 --> 00:37:42,486
What are you doing out so late?

610
00:37:42,577 --> 00:37:46,300
I was hoping I could get a statement about your first win of the season.

611
00:37:48,543 --> 00:37:50,640
I'll go you one better than that.

612
00:37:51,275 --> 00:37:53,166
I'll give you an exclusive.

613
00:37:58,515 --> 00:38:01,025
This will be my final season.

614
00:38:01,542 --> 00:38:06,119
The end of this year, win or lose -- I'm retiring.

615
00:38:06,524 --> 00:38:07,871
But why?

616
00:38:07,931 --> 00:38:10,707
That's it. That's your scoop.

617
00:38:10,762 --> 00:38:12,596
Oh, and do me a favor --

618
00:38:12,652 --> 00:38:16,410
keep it under wraps until after the first game.

619
00:38:29,983 --> 00:38:34,648
Hey, coach, could I ask you one more question, off the record?

620
00:38:36,998 --> 00:38:40,157
How do you deal with losing someone you love?

621
00:38:46,634 --> 00:38:48,462
Shut the door, son.

622
00:38:49,163 --> 00:38:50,521
Pull up a chair.

623
00:39:17,149 --> 00:39:19,778
Henry Wadsworth Longfellow wrote,

624
00:39:20,430 --> 00:39:22,863

00:39:24,542 --> 00:39:27,359

"It comes not back again."

627
00:40:01,961 --> 00:40:04,623
My dad said I should talk to someone,

628
00:40:04,730 --> 00:40:07,234
so I'm talking to you...

629
00:40:08,266 --> 00:40:09,917
all of you.

630
00:40:11,207 --> 00:40:12,400
Where do I begin?

631
00:40:12,507 --> 00:40:18,636
Um, well, I guess until a few days ago, I thought my mom was my mom,

632
00:40:18,713 --> 00:40:20,895
and my dad was my dad.

633
00:41:49,482 --> 00:41:50,297
Come on.

634
00:41:50,362 --> 00:41:51,489
We're late for class.
