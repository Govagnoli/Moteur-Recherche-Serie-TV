1
00:00:00,706 --> 00:00:02,353
Previously on One Tree Hill.

2
00:00:02,430 --> 00:00:03,409
Take off the wedding ring.

3
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:03,915
What?!

4
00:00:03,976 --> 00:00:05,160
Let them think you're a couple.

5
00:00:05,226 --> 00:00:06,680
But we're not a couple!

6
00:00:06,731 --> 00:00:07,910
You a couple in real life?

7
00:00:08,022 --> 00:00:09,817
- Um, actually- 
- You know, the music never lies.

8
00:00:09,885 --> 00:00:11,845
Somebody bashed in my car windshield last night.

9
00:00:11,907 --> 00:00:13,464
I mean, could things get any worse?

10
00:00:16,495 --> 00:00:17,959
You wanna ask me that again?

11
00:00:18,226 --> 00:00:20,008
I fell in love with Keith for real.

12
00:00:20,104 --> 00:00:22,572
I want him to know who you really are.

13
00:00:23,504 --> 00:00:24,355
I'm sorry.

14
00:00:25,211 --> 00:00:26,100
She left.

15
00:00:26,530 --> 00:00:28,728
Jules!? Jules?!

16
00:00:29,634 --> 00:00:30,544
I didn't do anything.

17
00:00:30,781 --> 00:00:32,839
You – sick – bastard!

18
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:35,567
I found out about your arrangement and I went to Jules.

19
00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:37,180
And I threatened to tell the truth.

20
00:00:37,651 --> 00:00:40,483
My dad got that job... in California!

21
00:00:40,565 --> 00:00:41,856
We're moving next week.

22
00:00:42,458 --> 00:00:43,503
What're we gonna do?

23
00:00:43,945 --> 00:00:44,958
I don't wanna go.

24
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:47,991
Nikki.

25
00:00:52,234 --> 00:00:53,113
What're you doing here?

26
00:00:53,258 --> 00:00:55,541
Go get Haley. She's your wife.

27
00:01:40,501 --> 00:01:42,413
Charles Bukowski once wrote;

28
00:01:43,263 --> 00:01:45,671
There will always be something to ruin our lives.

29
00:01:46,746 --> 00:01:49,916
It all depends on what or which finds us first.

30
00:01:51,205 --> 00:01:53,402
You're always ripe and ready to be taken.

31
00:01:54,314 --> 00:01:55,557
Well, well, well.

32
00:01:55,793 --> 00:01:57,934
Isn't this the picture of a perfect family?

33
00:01:58,698 --> 00:02:00,075
What're you doing here, Nikki?

34
00:02:00,401 --> 00:02:02,173
Oh, you mean why am I not in Seattle?

35
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:07,596
Right, some skank writes a random city on a napkin and I… catch the first flight out!

36
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:12,229
No. We had a court hearing a few weeks ago and imagine my surprise when you didn't show up.

37
00:02:12,746 --> 00:02:16,167
I guess you didn't have your mail forwarded to… 'Seattle'.

38
00:02:16,325 --> 00:02:17,846
So, since you didn't show,

39
00:02:18,256 --> 00:02:20,278
the judge granted me sole custody of my daughter, 

40
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:23,887
which, for the brunette impaired, means that Jenny comes home to mommy.

41
00:02:24,589 --> 00:02:25,331
You're lying!

42
00:02:26,089 --> 00:02:27,605
It's cute, she talks for you.

43
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:31,184
But I have a feeling that a judge would have a problem awarding custody

44
00:02:31,245 --> 00:02:35,234
to a high school drop-out who kidnapped his baby anyway.

45
00:02:35,398 --> 00:02:38,248
Well how do judges feel about women who abandon their children, huh?

46
00:02:38,367 --> 00:02:40,733
I don't know, there was no one in court to ask.

47
00:02:41,485 --> 00:02:42,755
So she's mine now.

48
00:02:43,129 --> 00:02:44,142
Hand her over.

49
00:02:44,301 --> 00:02:45,120
Forget it!

50
00:02:45,812 --> 00:02:46,990
She'll never be yours.

51
00:02:48,193 --> 00:02:49,713
You know, I don't even believe you, anyway.

52
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:51,782
Oh, you can not believe me all the way to jail if you want-

53
00:02:51,852 --> 00:02:54,366
Oh, ho, ho, she fights for you too!

54
00:02:57,071 --> 00:02:57,690
Fine…

55
00:02:58,515 --> 00:02:59,789
we'll let the police deal with it.

56
00:03:02,298 --> 00:03:03,528
See you soon bunny.

57
00:03:24,381 --> 00:03:25,272
Don't go.

58
00:03:29,266 --> 00:03:30,601
I just needed to say it.

59
00:03:32,818 --> 00:03:33,996
You have to stay!

60
00:03:35,214 --> 00:03:37,463
We're finally friends again and now I'm leaving.

61
00:03:45,271 --> 00:03:47,835
I really liked being the girl behind the red door.

62
00:04:14,461 --> 00:04:15,171
Mom?

63
00:04:17,102 --> 00:04:17,998
What're you doing here?

64
00:04:18,617 --> 00:04:19,933
I was waiting for Keith.

65
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:22,558
He never came home?

66
00:04:22,922 --> 00:04:24,273
Guess not.

67
00:04:25,724 --> 00:04:27,845
Yeah, he wasn't at Jules' apartment, either.

68
00:04:28,321 --> 00:04:30,092
Any idea where else he might be?

69
00:04:31,425 --> 00:04:34,757
If I had two guesses, they'd both be at a bar getting drunk.

70
00:04:36,457 --> 00:04:38,735
Why didn't you just tell me what was going on?

71
00:04:39,159 --> 00:04:40,511
Coz I knew you'd tell Keith.

72
00:04:41,863 --> 00:04:44,279
You know, and I thought… moving with Dan…

73
00:04:44,699 --> 00:04:48,375
was the only way to… get him to leave Keith alone.

74
00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:49,686
You should have told me.

75
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,638
I'm sorry I hurt you.

76
00:04:54,248 --> 00:04:56,491
You have no idea how hard this has been.

77
00:04:57,987 --> 00:04:59,214
I have an idea.

78
00:05:00,848 --> 00:05:04,151
So how did you find out about Dan's arrangement with Jules?

79
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:06,020
What arrangement with Jules?

80
00:05:06,756 --> 00:05:07,773
Keith…!

81
00:05:08,036 --> 00:05:08,937
What arrangement?

82
00:05:10,976 --> 00:05:13,900
Dan… paid Jules to be with you.

83
00:05:15,348 --> 00:05:18,358
So, both of you knew about it… and you said nothing!?

84
00:05:24,247 --> 00:05:25,932
Keith, wait, wait, wait!

85
00:05:27,769 --> 00:05:28,962
Let's talk about this.

86
00:05:29,987 --> 00:05:31,588
Everyone I thought I cared about…

87
00:05:32,531 --> 00:05:33,386
lied to me.

88
00:05:35,097 --> 00:05:36,192
What's there to talk about?

89
00:06:08,535 --> 00:06:10,572
I'm not gonna need a ride home after school.

90
00:06:11,013 --> 00:06:12,426
I'm going to dinner with Peyton.

91
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:14,501
How romantic.

92
00:06:15,254 --> 00:06:17,356
Velma picking you up in the 'Mystery Machine'?

93
00:06:18,771 --> 00:06:20,209
She's not gay, Felix.

94
00:06:20,634 --> 00:06:22,339
Well, everyone at school thinks she is.

95
00:06:22,646 --> 00:06:25,851
Yeah, because you painted 'DYKE' on her locker!

96
00:06:29,651 --> 00:06:30,997
It practically wrote itself.

97
00:06:31,534 --> 00:06:32,385
That's not funny.

98
00:06:32,513 --> 00:06:35,245
Look, whatever! She's always jealous of me hanging around Brooke

99
00:06:35,286 --> 00:06:36,880
and you know she has a crush on you.

100
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:37,959
That's not true.

101
00:06:38,108 --> 00:06:39,768
Why did we leave our last school, Anna?

102
00:06:40,151 --> 00:06:42,588
Because once the rumours started, we couldn't stop them.

103
00:06:42,656 --> 00:06:44,442
And no one cared if they weren't true.

104
00:06:45,209 --> 00:06:46,792
You cried every day, remember?

105
00:06:47,166 --> 00:06:48,835
Yes, Felix, I remember.

106
00:06:49,306 --> 00:06:51,292
And I wasn't gonna let that happen again.

107
00:06:51,396 --> 00:06:55,075
I knew if I painted 'DYKE' on Peyton's locker, everyone would think she was gay.

108
00:06:55,154 --> 00:06:57,165
That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard!

109
00:06:57,267 --> 00:06:58,640
I was friends with her!

110
00:06:58,711 --> 00:06:59,459
Really?

111
00:06:59,536 --> 00:07:01,660
I haven't seen you guys hanging out as much since then.

112
00:07:03,409 --> 00:07:04,319
You see, Anna,

113
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:06,452
you're so predictable.

114
00:07:09,192 --> 00:07:11,864
One well placed rumour… and you go running off, scared.

115
00:07:12,694 --> 00:07:13,421
Besides…

116
00:07:15,907 --> 00:07:17,108
better her than you.

117
00:07:35,995 --> 00:07:37,721
Little formal for work, don't you think?

118
00:07:39,456 --> 00:07:42,237
Did you set me up? Huh?

119
00:07:42,862 --> 00:07:45,089
Jules, the wedding, was it just all a big lie?!

120
00:07:45,729 --> 00:07:46,400
What?!

121
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:47,961
Of course not.

122
00:07:49,082 --> 00:07:51,551
We're brothers, Keith, I would never do anything to hurt you.

123
00:07:52,272 --> 00:07:54,074
Especially with the woman you're gonna marry.

124
00:07:58,017 --> 00:08:00,664
I'm sorry, I can't keep going, it's just too good.

125
00:08:01,825 --> 00:08:02,692
What can I say?

126
00:08:03,952 --> 00:08:05,298
Of course I set you up.

127
00:08:06,424 --> 00:08:07,581
How could you do that?

128
00:08:08,026 --> 00:08:10,136
Well, I just pictured you screwing my wife over and over again

129
00:08:10,182 --> 00:08:13,039
and then I thought about the heart attack it gave me and after that, it was easy.

130
00:08:14,118 --> 00:08:15,035
Where is she?

131
00:08:16,009 --> 00:08:17,324
I honestly don't know.

132
00:08:20,064 --> 00:08:22,541
Check in the yellow pages under 'W' for whore.

133
00:08:23,269 --> 00:08:26,321
Oh, wait; she's not that bright, you better check under 'H'.

134
00:08:39,881 --> 00:08:42,166
Hey, come on, Keith. Get off him.

135
00:08:46,318 --> 00:08:48,710
- Hey, calm down, man. 
- Get off me!!

136
00:08:53,959 --> 00:08:55,551
By the way, you're fired, too!

137
00:08:57,030 --> 00:08:58,194
Can you believe that guy?

138
00:09:05,852 --> 00:09:07,388
Congratulations, Dan,

139
00:09:08,908 --> 00:09:10,460
I got nothing left to lose.

140
00:09:12,295 --> 00:09:13,179
But you do.

141
00:09:15,089 --> 00:09:16,092
Remember that.

142
00:09:27,658 --> 00:09:30,280
I can't believe this is almost our last time walking to class together.

143
00:09:30,352 --> 00:09:32,912
I can't believe I'm getting weepy about walking to class.

144
00:09:33,198 --> 00:09:36,732
I feel like somebody needs to yell out 'Dead girl walking'!

145
00:09:38,718 --> 00:09:40,284
Ben geek staring!

146
00:09:42,112 --> 00:09:42,932
God!

147
00:09:43,372 --> 00:09:47,206
I just, I can't imagine what it would be like to not have you to talk to every day.

148
00:09:47,888 --> 00:09:49,445
I'm gonna get you a web cam.

149
00:09:49,552 --> 00:09:51,232
That way it'll be like you're living with me.

150
00:09:54,001 --> 00:09:54,708
Or…

151
00:09:55,654 --> 00:09:57,411
I could just live with you.

152
00:09:58,758 --> 00:10:01,088
You could. 
{111}{000}Yeah.

153
00:10:01,529 --> 00:10:03,817
You can. You spend most of your time at my house anyway.

154
00:10:03,868 --> 00:10:06,971
This is such a good idea, I'm so excited. I'm gonna find a phone and call my mom.

155
00:10:07,232 --> 00:10:08,578
Why not just use your cell?

156
00:10:08,696 --> 00:10:11,829
Uh… my parents put me on that 'pay as you go' plan…

157
00:10:12,019 --> 00:10:13,242
I haven't paid-

158
00:10:14,518 --> 00:10:15,481
Then go.

159
00:10:16,273 --> 00:10:17,001
Go!

160
00:10:21,573 --> 00:10:24,143
Hi. I have to tell you something.

161
00:10:24,537 --> 00:10:26,647
Alright, tell me on the way to class, I'm running late.

162
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:29,534
- It's gonna upset you. 
- Well, that seems to be the trend this week.

163
00:10:29,597 --> 00:10:32,411
Are you leaving town or here to steal a baby?

164
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:36,426
Felix is the one who spray painted your locker.

165
00:10:39,263 --> 00:10:41,561
You know what, um, I'm not all that surprised.

166
00:10:41,752 --> 00:10:43,717
I thought I saw him goose-stepping down the hall.

167
00:10:44,541 --> 00:10:45,561
I'm really sorry.

168
00:10:46,119 --> 00:10:49,263
Anna, you're not the one who owes me an apology.

169
00:10:50,225 --> 00:10:53,695
Well, I wouldn't hold your breath. Felix isn't the remorseful type.

170
00:10:54,428 --> 00:10:56,199
He owes you an apology, too.

171
00:10:56,884 --> 00:10:59,605
You know, he might have… spray painted 'DYKE' on my locker

172
00:10:59,666 --> 00:11:01,211
but he was talking about you.

173
00:11:02,164 --> 00:11:04,008
He might not know that but you do.

174
00:11:05,185 --> 00:11:06,035
I know.

175
00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:38,875
Haley, come on already, we're gonna be late for our own wedding reception.

176
00:11:39,305 --> 00:11:40,938
Okay, just give me two more minutes.

177
00:11:41,251 --> 00:11:43,544
The shower massager has three speeds.

178
00:11:43,612 --> 00:11:45,645
Yeah, and you have one: slow.

179
00:11:46,447 --> 00:11:49,003
Would you quit complaining. I need the extra time.

180
00:11:49,069 --> 00:11:51,404
Besides, people expect the bride to look beautiful.

181
00:11:51,487 --> 00:11:52,982
Yeah? What about me?

182
00:11:54,611 --> 00:11:57,446
Don't be silly, no one would ever expect that of you.

183
00:11:57,540 --> 00:11:59,626
Oh, okay. That does it.

184
00:12:04,535 --> 00:12:05,453
Nathan!

185
00:12:05,971 --> 00:12:09,110
We're gonna be late, we're gonna have to do it together.

186
00:12:20,765 --> 00:12:24,475
Mom, I wanna stay with Peyton. I don't wanna leave school right now!

187
00:12:24,921 --> 00:12:27,961
Oh, that is ridiculous, you and dad are never even home.

188
00:12:28,196 --> 00:12:30,061
No, mom!

189
00:12:30,907 --> 00:12:33,752
- I spend all my time at Peyton's house anyway! 
- You look about as happy as I do.

190
00:12:33,914 --> 00:12:36,143
- You okay? 
- Come on!

191
00:12:36,245 --> 00:12:38,954
Yeah, I'll be fine. I just… have some things going on.

192
00:12:39,026 --> 00:12:40,229
Nothing I can't handle.

193
00:12:42,062 --> 00:12:43,799
Because it's totally unfair!

194
00:12:44,708 --> 00:12:45,815
Yes, it is!

195
00:12:45,871 --> 00:12:47,289
Have you told her how you feel?

196
00:12:47,397 --> 00:12:50,832
Nah... Anyway, she's moving.

197
00:12:52,215 --> 00:12:54,176
At least she'd know, that's something.

198
00:12:54,976 --> 00:12:57,662
You're encouraging me to hit on your brother's girlfriend?

199
00:12:57,893 --> 00:13:00,152
Yeah, well, I like you better.

200
00:13:03,131 --> 00:13:04,882
I barely even knew her last year…

201
00:13:05,455 --> 00:13:08,056
and now I can't imagine life around here without her.

202
00:13:08,445 --> 00:13:09,741
No, I hate you!

203
00:13:10,539 --> 00:13:11,696
She's so sweet!

204
00:13:12,705 --> 00:13:13,591
They said no.

205
00:13:13,678 --> 00:13:14,436
Why?

206
00:13:14,554 --> 00:13:16,873
Because this week they've decided to be parents.

207
00:13:17,291 --> 00:13:20,130
They said that since you have no adult supervision

208
00:13:20,196 --> 00:13:22,331
it would be the same as having me stay alone.

209
00:13:22,413 --> 00:13:23,386
Are you kidding?!

210
00:13:23,451 --> 00:13:25,853
Charlie Brown has more parental supervision than you.

211
00:13:25,926 --> 00:13:28,285
Yeah, well, they also… think…

212
00:13:28,424 --> 00:13:29,192
What?

213
00:13:30,879 --> 00:13:33,257
They think you're a bad influence on me.

214
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:36,974
Unbelievable! Have your parents even met you?

215
00:13:37,057 --> 00:13:38,075
Only briefly.

216
00:13:39,208 --> 00:13:44,478
I can't believe they won't let me stay with you. My mom is being such a major bi-

217
00:13:45,521 --> 00:13:46,180
-tch.

218
00:13:46,927 --> 00:13:50,133
Well, if it isn't the other woman… and my favourite travel agent.

219
00:13:50,209 --> 00:13:51,808
Any other places you'd like to recommend?

220
00:13:51,878 --> 00:13:53,718
Yeah, far away from me!

221
00:13:53,788 --> 00:13:56,420
Unless you'd like you next period to come out of your nose.

222
00:13:58,673 --> 00:14:02,523
So, I showed up at Jake's this morning with Tree Hill's finest and guess what,

223
00:14:02,590 --> 00:14:03,875
no Jake, no baby.

224
00:14:04,279 --> 00:14:05,626
Where the hell are they?

225
00:14:06,031 --> 00:14:06,921
Phoenix.

226
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:09,267
Are you even sure Jenny's your daughter, coz…

227
00:14:09,486 --> 00:14:10,931
I mean, she doesn't look like a bitch.

228
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:14,458
Well, we'll see who the bitch is once Jake spends some time in jail.

229
00:14:15,016 --> 00:14:16,358
It'll still be you.

230
00:14:16,956 --> 00:14:18,579
Look, I'm tired of these games.

231
00:14:18,667 --> 00:14:21,738
Then leave! You don't even care about Jenny, okay?

232
00:14:21,797 --> 00:14:23,731
You're just doing this to get back at Jake.

233
00:14:24,708 --> 00:14:28,830
You know, only someone without a mother could think that.

234
00:14:29,234 --> 00:14:33,202
You know, you'd better leave before Jenny knows what it feels like to be motherless.

235
00:14:33,916 --> 00:14:36,238
Oh, wait, she already does!

236
00:14:40,171 --> 00:14:43,433
Tell Jake that the longer he hides, the worse it's gonna be for him.

237
00:14:47,882 --> 00:14:52,055
Don't let her get to you, Peyton. No judge is gonna side with that psychopath over Jake.

238
00:14:52,157 --> 00:14:53,375
Looks like they already did.

239
00:14:54,031 --> 00:14:56,187
I don't even think Jake's going to court to challenge it.

240
00:14:56,811 --> 00:14:58,208
You think he's gonna run again?

241
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:00,544
He might.

242
00:15:01,076 --> 00:15:03,031
If he thinks that Jenny will wind up with Nikki.

243
00:15:04,338 --> 00:15:05,900
Damn it! I hate Mondays.

244
00:15:06,105 --> 00:15:06,718
Come on.

245
00:15:08,707 --> 00:15:09,648
You wanted to see me?

246
00:15:17,015 --> 00:15:19,324
Mr Tagarro, close the door please.

247
00:15:19,422 --> 00:15:21,612
It's the one without 'DYKE' painted on it.

248
00:15:41,346 --> 00:15:42,069
Haley, what's wrong?

249
00:15:47,014 --> 00:15:47,935
My parents.

250
00:15:48,406 --> 00:15:49,517
What happened, are they alright?

251
00:15:49,609 --> 00:15:50,603
Yeah, they're fine.

252
00:15:51,596 --> 00:15:53,116
I'm just being stupid, I…

253
00:15:54,693 --> 00:15:57,842
When they were here, I spent all my time at Lucas' house or with you

254
00:15:57,919 --> 00:16:01,147
and now that they're gone, I just… wish I could see them again.

255
00:16:01,493 --> 00:16:04,831
Haley, they're in Georgia. I'd hardly say they're gone.

256
00:16:04,883 --> 00:16:06,080
Well they're not here!

257
00:16:07,755 --> 00:16:10,914
My house isn't even my house anymore. It's like my whole family just, like, packed up

258
00:16:10,981 --> 00:16:13,756
and left before my high school graduation.

259
00:16:13,833 --> 00:16:15,359
Not your whole family, Hales.

260
00:16:15,896 --> 00:16:18,164
You still have me. I'm not going anywhere.

261
00:16:18,773 --> 00:16:21,794
And your house is here too, it's just… smaller and a lot more…

262
00:16:22,814 --> 00:16:23,771
apartmenty.

263
00:16:25,711 --> 00:16:28,348
Yeah. I know, I just…

264
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:31,266
Urgh, I don't mean to be such a baby about this.

265
00:16:31,830 --> 00:16:33,202
I just really miss them.

266
00:16:41,353 --> 00:16:42,106
Pack a bag.

267
00:16:43,222 --> 00:16:44,157
We're going to Atlanta.

268
00:16:44,261 --> 00:16:45,878
Uh… yeah, right!

269
00:16:45,956 --> 00:16:46,959
I'm serious.

270
00:16:47,333 --> 00:16:50,145
We can't do that, we're broke, and we have to go to school.

271
00:16:50,226 --> 00:16:53,338
I'm sure I can scrounge up enough money for gas and screw school!

272
00:16:53,432 --> 00:16:55,622
You're a year ahead of everybody and there's no way I'm gonna flunk;

273
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:56,841
I married my tutor.

274
00:16:58,228 --> 00:17:00,712
That's really sweet. It's not that big a deal.

275
00:17:00,798 --> 00:17:03,496
Hey, yes it is, alright?

276
00:17:04,613 --> 00:17:09,364
Now, listen, I may not always be able to give you everything but I can do this.

277
00:17:10,307 --> 00:17:12,467
Come on; let's go see your family.

278
00:17:14,444 --> 00:17:15,277
Thank you.

279
00:17:15,795 --> 00:17:18,596
You know, as long as I have you I have everything I want.

280
00:17:18,852 --> 00:17:19,851
But we're still going.

281
00:17:34,847 --> 00:17:36,598
You brought it on yourself, Felix!

282
00:17:37,175 --> 00:17:38,369
I can't believe you.

283
00:17:38,769 --> 00:17:40,126
Do you know how bad this is?!

284
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,916
Mom and dad are gonna have to buy the school a new wing to get me out of this!

285
00:17:42,973 --> 00:17:44,529
You are missing the whole point!

286
00:17:44,771 --> 00:17:46,837
Everything is always about you.

287
00:17:46,914 --> 00:17:48,636
You never stop to think about other people!

288
00:17:48,697 --> 00:17:49,475
And you do?

289
00:17:49,547 --> 00:17:52,147
Did you even consider what would happen to me when you turned me in?

290
00:17:52,213 --> 00:17:54,370
You totally screwed me over when I was the only one looking out for you!

291
00:17:54,432 --> 00:17:56,218
You were looking out for yourself!

292
00:17:56,306 --> 00:17:59,214
You couldn't handle anyone thinking that your sister was a lesbian!

293
00:17:59,285 --> 00:17:59,956
Whatever.

294
00:18:00,099 --> 00:18:04,083
The whole thing would have blown over if you would have just kept your big mouth shut!

295
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:07,333
No one's gonna even care when they find out I did it.

296
00:18:09,192 --> 00:18:10,253
Even Brooke?

297
00:18:33,048 --> 00:18:34,332
Can I help you with something?

298
00:18:34,562 --> 00:18:38,090
Oh, hi. I'm Charlotte. My parents are looking at the house.

299
00:18:38,321 --> 00:18:40,670
It's cute, I guess, for the 'Sticks'.

300
00:18:41,116 --> 00:18:42,114
The 'Sticks'?

301
00:18:43,066 --> 00:18:45,253
Oh, you live here, right.

302
00:18:45,555 --> 00:18:50,834
Must be a huge drag, like, what do you do for fun without cute boys or good parties?

303
00:18:51,019 --> 00:18:53,086
Well, well.

304
00:18:53,255 --> 00:18:56,927
We have a nightly banjo duel and then there's the cousins swap

305
00:18:57,009 --> 00:18:59,437
and on Friday nights we all take baths together.

306
00:18:59,870 --> 00:19:03,137
Oh, look, I'm really sorry. I didn't mean to insult you.

307
00:19:03,193 --> 00:19:05,170
I guess I'm just… bitter about this move.

308
00:19:05,666 --> 00:19:06,890
Yeah, I know the feeling.

309
00:19:08,831 --> 00:19:09,420
Hey!

310
00:19:10,515 --> 00:19:11,191
Hey!

311
00:19:12,341 --> 00:19:14,632
Maybe Tree Hill's not so bad after all.

312
00:19:17,903 --> 00:19:19,030
Well, cya.

313
00:19:21,754 --> 00:19:22,460
Who was that?

314
00:19:24,289 --> 00:19:25,272
The new me.

315
00:19:33,868 --> 00:19:34,994
Any word from Keith?

316
00:19:35,455 --> 00:19:36,090
No.

317
00:19:39,859 --> 00:19:41,492
Do you think he's gonna be okay?

318
00:19:43,663 --> 00:19:44,723
Not for a while.

319
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:48,398
Keith was right;

320
00:19:49,698 --> 00:19:50,933
I should have told him.

321
00:19:52,302 --> 00:19:54,005
You though you were looking out for him, Lucas.

322
00:19:54,255 --> 00:19:55,822
Your heart was in the right place.

323
00:19:56,458 --> 00:19:59,759
Yeah, it may take some time, but eventually, he'll understand that.

324
00:20:02,069 --> 00:20:03,600
So, when're you moving home?

325
00:20:08,372 --> 00:20:09,265
I'm not.

326
00:20:10,344 --> 00:20:11,644
Like hell you're not!

327
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,726
What reason on Earth could you have for staying?!

328
00:20:15,028 --> 00:20:17,710
If Dan could do this to his own brother…

329
00:20:18,315 --> 00:20:20,132
who knows what else he could be up to?

330
00:20:21,464 --> 00:20:25,325
Look, I'm his one weakness. I gotta stay!

331
00:20:35,339 --> 00:20:37,003
Hi, you've reached the Scott's, um,

332
00:20:37,054 --> 00:20:39,865
- my wife and I are- 
- Your wife? What do you, like, own me now?

333
00:20:39,957 --> 00:20:41,131
Yeah, I do.

334
00:20:42,518 --> 00:20:45,441
Hi, this is Nathan and Haley Scott, please leave a message…

335
00:20:45,538 --> 00:20:46,495
or… not.

336
00:20:46,726 --> 00:20:48,380
That's the worst thing I've ever heard.

337
00:20:48,481 --> 00:20:50,144
Shut up, it rhymed, I like it!

338
00:20:50,243 --> 00:20:51,727
- Oops! 
- Message has been erased.

339
00:20:51,785 --> 00:20:53,622
Oh fine, let's just do one together, okay?

340
00:20:53,688 --> 00:20:56,085
Wait a minute, isn't that something only really cheesy couples do?

341
00:20:56,167 --> 00:20:58,860
Yeah, well we are a really cheesy couple, Mister.

342
00:20:59,116 --> 00:21:00,218
- Good point. 
- Okay.

343
00:21:00,556 --> 00:21:03,192
- Hi, you've reached Haley- 
- And Nathan, I live here too.

344
00:21:03,259 --> 00:21:05,808
Yes, Nathan lives here too because we're married!

345
00:21:05,886 --> 00:21:08,845
And, uh, we can't get to the phone right now because we're, um…

346
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:10,242
We're having sex?

347
00:21:11,067 --> 00:21:12,500
I mean, just, we're having really-

348
00:21:12,592 --> 00:21:14,323
- Okay. 
- ...hot sex. Oh!

349
00:21:16,051 --> 00:21:18,204
Oh, we're still on. Uh, leave a message!

350
00:21:18,291 --> 00:21:19,567
And, uh, we'll get back to you when we're done!

351
00:21:34,644 --> 00:21:38,547
This is crazy. I don't wanna get anybody else in trouble. I should just go.

352
00:21:39,142 --> 00:21:40,835
Jake, you need to be smart about this,

353
00:21:41,097 --> 00:21:42,388
and running isn't smart.

354
00:21:42,597 --> 00:21:45,647
You need legal help. Settle it that way, especially if Nikki's already done that.

355
00:21:47,497 --> 00:21:48,827
I can't afford a lawyer!

356
00:21:48,997 --> 00:21:49,800
I can.

357
00:21:49,944 --> 00:21:51,003
I got a great attorney.

358
00:21:51,429 --> 00:21:52,856
I can't ask you to do that.

359
00:21:53,523 --> 00:21:55,438
You're not, I'm offering.

360
00:21:59,339 --> 00:22:00,240
Thanks!

361
00:22:00,537 --> 00:22:03,302
I mean… I appreciate it but…

362
00:22:03,548 --> 00:22:05,785
costs aside, there's no guarantee that I'll win.

363
00:22:05,938 --> 00:22:08,606
It's true, but at least this way you get a chance.

364
00:22:08,791 --> 00:22:09,770
I'll make a call.

365
00:22:10,371 --> 00:22:11,259
Okay.

366
00:22:11,668 --> 00:22:13,743
So, that's great news!

367
00:22:14,692 --> 00:22:15,692
Yeah.

368
00:22:18,201 --> 00:22:22,000
But if there's even a chance that Nikki could get custody of Jenny, I can't take it.

369
00:22:28,949 --> 00:22:31,022
Keith, I am so sorry!

370
00:22:32,311 --> 00:22:33,567
Yeah, me too.

371
00:22:34,081 --> 00:22:35,682
Wait, please!

372
00:22:36,084 --> 00:22:38,523
Karen, haven't you already done enough?

373
00:22:39,021 --> 00:22:40,136
I wanna help!

374
00:22:41,005 --> 00:22:44,222
Look, I didn't know about Jules until right before the wedding…

375
00:22:44,545 --> 00:22:48,088
and the only reason I know anything is because I was worried about Lucas and…

376
00:22:49,208 --> 00:22:53,208
so Andy and I hired a private investigator to look into Dan.

377
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:57,160
I had no idea that he was involved with Jules.

378
00:22:57,229 --> 00:22:59,301
Well it doesn't really matter anymore!

379
00:22:59,434 --> 00:23:01,477
- Does it?! 
- Of course it does!

380
00:23:03,224 --> 00:23:04,747
If she truly loves you…

381
00:23:06,621 --> 00:23:08,106
couldn't you still love her?

382
00:23:10,503 --> 00:23:11,531
I don't know.

383
00:23:15,224 --> 00:23:18,536
I guess I'd at least… like a chance to…

384
00:23:21,322 --> 00:23:23,717
I guess I'd at least like to find out the truth.

385
00:23:29,359 --> 00:23:32,063
Her real name is Emily Chambers.

386
00:23:33,615 --> 00:23:37,091
Everything in that file is what the investigator found out about her.

387
00:23:42,336 --> 00:23:43,553
Emily.

388
00:23:48,975 --> 00:23:51,715
Dan… is a monster.

389
00:23:53,184 --> 00:23:54,704
But he gave me Lucas…

390
00:23:55,591 --> 00:24:01,058
and, despite his worst intentions, I have the one person I love most in the world.

391
00:24:03,634 --> 00:24:04,872
Maybe you can, too.

392
00:24:16,341 --> 00:24:18,240
You know, TV might be more entertaining.

393
00:24:19,823 --> 00:24:21,830
There's nothing on TV I wanna see.

394
00:24:24,288 --> 00:24:25,210
Talk to me.

395
00:24:28,664 --> 00:24:30,847
My whole world's being ripped away from me.

396
00:24:31,604 --> 00:24:32,757
So is Jake's…

397
00:24:33,839 --> 00:24:34,830
and yours…

398
00:24:36,499 --> 00:24:39,920
and all I can do is sit here and watch it happen.

399
00:24:43,924 --> 00:24:47,827
Tell you what, let's change that; I'll kill Nikki for you…

400
00:24:48,413 --> 00:24:51,843
No, really, at least that way… Jake would stay here,

401
00:24:51,932 --> 00:24:54,537
I'd be sent to a prison in North Carolina and be close to you

402
00:24:54,634 --> 00:24:57,542
and Felix could come and give me multiple conjugals.

403
00:25:00,619 --> 00:25:01,705
That was a joke!

404
00:25:02,032 --> 00:25:03,425
Yeah, um…

405
00:25:04,138 --> 00:25:07,382
Brooke, you know how they say 'misery loves company', um…

406
00:25:08,376 --> 00:25:10,691
there's something I gotta tell you about Felix.

407
00:25:18,146 --> 00:25:19,195
We are finished!

408
00:25:19,456 --> 00:25:20,435
Look, let me explain.

409
00:25:20,512 --> 00:25:23,793
No, I can not believe you would be such a hateful scumbag

410
00:25:23,921 --> 00:25:27,582
as to writh 'DYKE' anywhere, let alone on my best friends locker!!

411
00:25:27,704 --> 00:25:28,631
Brooke, wait.

412
00:25:29,189 --> 00:25:33,899
I am so glad I am moving, I had no idea I was a greying wizard's next door neighbour!

413
00:25:33,972 --> 00:25:36,942
And you actually had me starting to think you were a decent guy!

414
00:25:37,013 --> 00:25:39,180
Look, I was trying to protect my sister, Brooke!

415
00:25:39,398 --> 00:25:43,203
Look, I did it the night at the dance when Peyton and I argued and you dumped me!

416
00:25:43,443 --> 00:25:44,329
I wasn't thinking.

417
00:25:44,432 --> 00:25:45,778
Well, what a surprise!

418
00:25:46,342 --> 00:25:49,132
Look, I was in a dark place and I took it out on Peyton, I'm sorry.

419
00:25:49,204 --> 00:25:50,780
Yeah, you're right, you are sorry.

420
00:25:50,853 --> 00:25:54,197
So why don't you crawl back into your dark little place and die there!

421
00:25:55,225 --> 00:25:55,880
Brooke?

422
00:25:56,623 --> 00:25:57,427
Brooke?!

423
00:26:11,835 --> 00:26:14,302
Lucas, coming in to say goodbye?

424
00:26:15,557 --> 00:26:17,685
Actually, I think I'm gonna stay.

425
00:26:18,009 --> 00:26:19,775
Well, at least for now?

426
00:26:21,947 --> 00:26:23,678
Look, as messed up as it was,

427
00:26:24,158 --> 00:26:26,396
you did keep your promise to leave Keith alone…

428
00:26:26,462 --> 00:26:27,830
so I need to keep mine.

429
00:26:29,145 --> 00:26:30,317
And, well,

430
00:26:31,061 --> 00:26:35,580
you're also paying for my HCM medicine and since I really don't wanna die anytime soon…

431
00:26:36,835 --> 00:26:37,737
I need it.

432
00:26:39,632 --> 00:26:40,690
What about your mom?

433
00:26:42,329 --> 00:26:44,926
Well, she's not… too happy with me right now.

434
00:26:45,622 --> 00:26:48,505
I think… besides you,

435
00:26:48,667 --> 00:26:51,109
I'm… currently her least favourite person.

436
00:26:52,472 --> 00:26:53,839
I'm sure that's not true.

437
00:26:54,868 --> 00:26:56,343
But I'm thrilled to have you.

438
00:27:00,204 --> 00:27:01,094
Thanks.

439
00:27:30,195 --> 00:27:32,302
Nathan, I'm slipping, you're gonna drop me!

440
00:27:32,378 --> 00:27:35,787
Drop you? If I wanted to, I could shoot you across this room like a three pointer.

441
00:27:35,869 --> 00:27:36,708
You want me to try?

442
00:27:36,774 --> 00:27:38,009
Don't you dare!

443
00:27:38,230 --> 00:27:40,488
Well, we're gonna do this the right way.

444
00:27:40,806 --> 00:27:43,075
Now, since I couldn't get the fancy honeymoon suite…

445
00:27:43,693 --> 00:27:47,774
I figured I could, you know, at least carry you across our one bedroomed threshold.

446
00:27:51,010 --> 00:27:52,479
Oh my god!

447
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:54,492
I wanted everything to be perfect.

448
00:27:54,946 --> 00:27:57,277
I know you didn't get your dream wedding, or your dream honeymoon-

449
00:27:57,349 --> 00:27:58,858
I got my dream guy.

450
00:27:59,101 --> 00:28:00,615
Well, yeah, you did get that.

451
00:28:10,373 --> 00:28:11,802
Honeymoon suite, huh?

452
00:28:13,816 --> 00:28:17,219
Listen, we don't have to do anything, alright? It's not why I married you.

453
00:28:18,576 --> 00:28:20,245
You gotta be kidding me.

454
00:28:27,853 --> 00:28:29,805
Oh, what've I gotten myself into?

455
00:28:45,812 --> 00:28:47,115
I'm here for Haley Scott.

456
00:28:48,606 --> 00:28:49,491
Haley who?

457
00:28:51,785 --> 00:28:52,783
Haley James.

458
00:28:54,057 --> 00:28:55,189
Are you on the list?

459
00:28:58,082 --> 00:28:59,077
I'm her husband.

460
00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:51,331
Oh, that's great. Tell her I said 'hi'. Okay.

461
00:29:55,253 --> 00:29:57,393
Nathan, oh my god! What're you doing here?!

462
00:30:07,495 --> 00:30:08,646
I wanted to see you.

463
00:30:10,737 --> 00:30:12,466
I needed to see you, I-

464
00:30:14,104 --> 00:30:16,281
I'm so glad you did, I miss you.

465
00:30:19,149 --> 00:30:22,804
Listen, I asked you to marry me because I wanna spend my life with you.

466
00:30:23,561 --> 00:30:25,144
I still want that.

467
00:30:27,975 --> 00:30:28,953
I love you, Haley.

468
00:30:29,101 --> 00:30:30,028
I love you too.

469
00:30:30,617 --> 00:30:33,264
So I came here for you and I'll be here for you no matter what.

470
00:30:33,429 --> 00:30:36,055
I'll go with you on the tour, I'll wait for you, whatever you want me to do.

471
00:30:37,012 --> 00:30:38,686
I'm not giving up on us.

472
00:30:40,186 --> 00:30:41,732
I'm not giving up on our marriage.

473
00:30:46,899 --> 00:30:48,527
I don't know what to say.

474
00:30:52,265 --> 00:30:55,664
Oh, no-no, Chris and I aren't together, I promise you.

475
00:30:55,741 --> 00:30:57,277
It's never been about that.

476
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:04,379
You're not wearing your ring.

477
00:31:06,807 --> 00:31:07,768
I love you.

478
00:31:08,367 --> 00:31:09,544
Oh, I do,

479
00:31:11,811 --> 00:31:13,140
but I feel like…

480
00:31:13,952 --> 00:31:17,808
maybe we rushed things a little bit, maybe I… I rushed things a little bit.

481
00:31:17,886 --> 00:31:21,111
We're so young and I wasn't ready for all this.

482
00:31:21,227 --> 00:31:23,175
You and the music and…

483
00:31:24,612 --> 00:31:26,764
now it's all happening at once and…

484
00:31:28,196 --> 00:31:29,671
it's really hard!

485
00:31:31,893 --> 00:31:34,684
I don't know if I can be… who you need me to be.

486
00:31:35,263 --> 00:31:37,157
All I want you to be is my wife!

487
00:31:38,597 --> 00:31:40,050
Is it too much to ask?

488
00:31:42,036 --> 00:31:42,825
Haley!

489
00:31:44,454 --> 00:31:45,323
We're ready.

490
00:31:49,318 --> 00:31:50,285
I have to go.

491
00:31:52,466 --> 00:31:53,326
Um…

492
00:31:54,749 --> 00:31:57,808
God, can you just wait here and I will… meet you after the show

493
00:31:57,869 --> 00:32:00,095
and then… we can talk and…

494
00:32:00,536 --> 00:32:01,656
I don't even-

495
00:32:05,546 --> 00:32:07,814
I'm really happy that you came. 

496
00:32:11,946 --> 00:32:12,814
I love you.

497
00:32:17,258 --> 00:32:18,174
I love you.

498
00:32:19,208 --> 00:32:22,306
Please welcome back, Haley James!

499
00:32:58,603 --> 00:33:00,655
Mom and dad are sending me to military school.

500
00:33:01,823 --> 00:33:04,151
At least there won't be any lesbians to scare you.

501
00:33:04,803 --> 00:33:06,225
Yeah, well Brooke dumped me, too.

502
00:33:09,722 --> 00:33:10,445
You know…

503
00:33:11,556 --> 00:33:14,161
no matter where we moved or how we fit in, you always had my back

504
00:33:14,233 --> 00:33:15,841
and I always had yours, always!

505
00:33:17,885 --> 00:33:21,176
Now you turn your back on me coz I wrote 'DYKE' on some stupid chick's locker?

506
00:33:21,401 --> 00:33:22,778
She's not stupid.

507
00:33:23,484 --> 00:33:26,133
Peyton has been more of a friend to me than you have…

508
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:29,516
and she didn't do anything to deserve you tagging her locker!

509
00:33:29,638 --> 00:33:30,423
Who cares?

510
00:33:30,806 --> 00:33:31,585
I care!

511
00:33:32,696 --> 00:33:34,073
It's a hate crime!

512
00:33:35,199 --> 00:33:36,199
It's just a word.

513
00:33:36,363 --> 00:33:38,368
It's not just a word…

514
00:33:38,790 --> 00:33:40,197
it's who I am!

515
00:33:45,845 --> 00:33:47,785
Peyton isn't gay, Felix.

516
00:33:49,096 --> 00:33:50,027
I am.

517
00:33:50,806 --> 00:33:52,926
So you wanna spry paint 'DYKE' somewhere…

518
00:33:53,299 --> 00:33:54,890
do it on my walls!

519
00:33:55,010 --> 00:33:56,286
Spray it on me!

520
00:33:57,890 --> 00:33:58,972
What're you talking about?

521
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,918
You know what I'm talking about!

522
00:34:02,377 --> 00:34:03,324
The rumours…

523
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:05,628
they weren't rumours.

524
00:34:07,271 --> 00:34:08,474
They aren't.

525
00:34:09,786 --> 00:34:10,820
Shut up, Anna!

526
00:34:11,142 --> 00:34:13,487
No! I won't 'shut up'!

527
00:34:13,882 --> 00:34:15,649
You think I've been running from this?!

528
00:34:16,021 --> 00:34:17,005
I haven't!

529
00:34:17,184 --> 00:34:19,233
I have been carrying it around!

530
00:34:19,974 --> 00:34:23,640
And if you think what you've been doing is protecting me, then you're wrong!

531
00:34:23,988 --> 00:34:27,419
You have been making me afraid to be who I am!

532
00:34:28,848 --> 00:34:31,023
Well I won't be afraid anymore.

533
00:34:33,081 --> 00:34:34,806
Now you know the truth…

534
00:34:35,883 --> 00:34:37,183
I'm gay.

535
00:34:45,585 --> 00:34:47,572
So, do you still have my back?

536
00:35:06,755 --> 00:35:08,225
Sorry about you and Felix.

537
00:35:08,901 --> 00:35:09,602
Yeah!

538
00:35:14,619 --> 00:35:15,526
Are you okay?

539
00:35:16,728 --> 00:35:18,630
Yeah, it's just…

540
00:35:20,171 --> 00:35:22,779
every time I see something in Tree Hill, it's probably the last time

541
00:35:22,830 --> 00:35:26,181
so I feel like I have to take mental pictures of everything, you know?

542
00:35:27,067 --> 00:35:29,740
Well… make sure…

543
00:35:30,857 --> 00:35:33,012
you make me look good when you take my picture.

544
00:35:34,911 --> 00:35:37,169
So, what're you gonna miss most about me?

545
00:35:38,337 --> 00:35:39,483
I can only choose one thing?

546
00:35:39,586 --> 00:35:41,695
Yes, and it has to be something good;

547
00:35:41,917 --> 00:35:45,843
not… how much you'll miss hanging out with me or how hot I am!

548
00:35:45,949 --> 00:35:48,680
Hmm… neither one of those, huh?

549
00:35:48,776 --> 00:35:50,189
- No. 
- Damn!

550
00:35:52,279 --> 00:35:54,137
I miss the girl behind the red door.

551
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:02,785
Come on.

552
00:36:18,616 --> 00:36:20,811
This is all my stuff, I don't understand.

553
00:36:21,682 --> 00:36:26,874
I… had my mom talk to your parents and they said that you could stay here till the summer.

554
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:30,776
They didn't… want to, Brooke, but…

555
00:36:31,185 --> 00:36:33,234
my mom can be really convincing.

556
00:36:34,790 --> 00:36:36,218
You did this for me?

557
00:36:37,672 --> 00:36:39,301
I wasn't ready to lose you yet.

558
00:36:43,801 --> 00:36:46,172
So, you, gonna stay or what?!

559
00:36:47,518 --> 00:36:49,699
Yeah, of course!

560
00:36:53,146 --> 00:36:55,998
Oh… I wasn't ready to be lost.

561
00:36:57,067 --> 00:36:57,918
Thank you.

562
00:37:15,832 --> 00:37:18,428
So much for painting happy little trees, huh?

563
00:37:19,721 --> 00:37:24,132
I think you might wanna start locking your door if a man with a baby can take you by surprise.

564
00:37:24,470 --> 00:37:29,589
Well… if every surprise is this man with this baby, then… the door stays unlocked.

565
00:37:30,957 --> 00:37:32,948
I was worried you skipped town again.

566
00:37:33,097 --> 00:37:34,762
No, no, I'm gonna stay.

567
00:37:35,426 --> 00:37:38,642
Look, I said when I came back in town, I wasn't gonna run anymore, I meant it.

568
00:37:39,165 --> 00:37:42,666
If Nikki's ready to fight for custody… then so am I.

569
00:37:44,489 --> 00:37:46,219
Well, what if she shows up tonight?

570
00:37:46,804 --> 00:37:48,416
Well, lock the door, just in case.

571
00:37:50,387 --> 00:37:51,411
Look, Peyton.

572
00:37:52,466 --> 00:37:55,498
I know this is hard. I'm sorry you have to deal with this, it's just…

573
00:37:56,445 --> 00:37:59,312
the last time I left town it was me and Jenny and now it's…

574
00:38:00,847 --> 00:38:03,209
me and Jenny and… you.

575
00:38:15,020 --> 00:38:17,032
You guys have been great. Chris Keller's up next.

576
00:38:41,122 --> 00:38:42,321
Dinner's in ten minutes.

577
00:38:42,857 --> 00:38:43,533
Okay.

578
00:38:45,286 --> 00:38:47,886
Thank you, Karen. You know you saved my life, right?

579
00:38:48,812 --> 00:38:50,440
Don't thank me yet, Brooke.

580
00:38:51,327 --> 00:38:52,242
Sit down.

581
00:38:55,443 --> 00:38:58,208
Now, I know your parents are a lot more…

582
00:38:59,267 --> 00:39:00,332
hands off.

583
00:39:01,975 --> 00:39:02,632
Yeah!

584
00:39:02,703 --> 00:39:06,589
But I'm not gonna make it easy on you and sometimes you're not gonna like me for it.

585
00:39:07,111 --> 00:39:09,932
When you're in my house, you live by my rules.

586
00:39:10,275 --> 00:39:12,549
There will be no staying out all night.

587
00:39:12,641 --> 00:39:15,468
No boys sleeping over. No-

588
00:39:19,093 --> 00:39:20,955
It's just like having a real mom.

589
00:39:27,213 --> 00:39:28,098
Alright!

590
00:39:28,564 --> 00:39:29,295
Okay.

591
00:39:42,752 --> 00:39:43,775
Keith, are you leaving?

592
00:39:47,066 --> 00:39:47,804
Look…

593
00:39:49,757 --> 00:39:52,997
I know I made the wrong decision in not telling you about Jules and Dan…

594
00:39:54,006 --> 00:39:55,061
and I'm sorry.

595
00:39:56,550 --> 00:39:58,655
But you gotta know, Jules loves you.

596
00:40:02,407 --> 00:40:03,530
You mean Emily?

597
00:40:06,726 --> 00:40:08,552
You should have told me the truth, Luke.

598
00:40:09,377 --> 00:40:10,917
I've always been honest with you.

599
00:40:12,263 --> 00:40:16,185
I just, it though… I thought we meant more to each other.

600
00:40:19,166 --> 00:40:20,328
Maybe I was wrong.

601
00:40:24,606 --> 00:40:25,868
Look, Keith, where're you going?

602
00:40:27,588 --> 00:40:28,382
Don't know.

603
00:40:29,651 --> 00:40:30,680
You coming back?

604
00:40:33,210 --> 00:40:34,998
For the first time in my life…

605
00:40:36,169 --> 00:40:38,504
I don't know if I have anything to come back for.
