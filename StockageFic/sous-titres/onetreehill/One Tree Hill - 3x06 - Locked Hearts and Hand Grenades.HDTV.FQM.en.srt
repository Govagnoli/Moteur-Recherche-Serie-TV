1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:01,894
Previously on "One Tree Hill"...

2
00:00:01,972 --> 00:00:03,256
What the hell is this?

3
00:00:03,333 --> 00:00:04,833
It's an article I wrote.

4
00:00:04,912 --> 00:00:06,511
I've got a headline for your article.

5
00:00:06,578 --> 00:00:07,869
It's called "go to hell."

6
00:00:07,961 --> 00:00:11,749
The candidate that I'm endorsing -- miss Karen Roe.

7
00:00:12,262 --> 00:00:13,611
You want me to ask her out?

8
00:00:13,702 --> 00:00:14,914
She's the one.

9
00:00:15,027 --> 00:00:16,306
If you insist.

10
00:00:17,465 --> 00:00:19,886
You're using me, and I'm okay with that.

11
00:00:19,961 --> 00:00:23,099
You're the one who wanted to be non-exclusive. I'm just doing what you wanted.

12
00:00:23,171 --> 00:00:25,867
I wanted you to fight for me.

13
00:00:25,956 --> 00:00:28,738
You're just... like... Dan.

14
00:00:31,743 --> 00:00:33,669
I'm making you co-captains.

15
00:00:33,744 --> 00:00:37,449
And you two are either gonna make this work or tear it down!

16
00:00:37,713 --> 00:00:39,262
I needed to buy some medicine.

17
00:00:39,411 --> 00:00:40,429
For what?

18
00:00:40,982 --> 00:00:42,435
I have HCM.

19
00:00:42,777 --> 00:00:47,051
I made a deal with the devil that I'd stand by his side through this election.

20
00:00:47,158 --> 00:00:51,909
I can... still make things... difficult for him.

21
00:00:52,042 --> 00:00:54,552
You want to play with me? Game on.

22
00:00:56,024 --> 00:00:57,261
You can help Haley with her music.

23
00:00:57,345 --> 00:00:58,754
And you care why?

24
00:00:58,844 --> 00:01:00,153
Because she loves it.

25
00:01:00,302 --> 00:01:01,401
And I love her.

26
00:01:01,505 --> 00:01:03,371
Working with Chris nearly killed our marriage.

27
00:01:03,453 --> 00:01:06,658
I told you I needed to be able to trust you again. This is your chance.

28
00:01:48,366 --> 00:01:52,629
And in Tree Hill, North Carolina, the local high school basketball team, the Ravens,

29
00:01:52,712 --> 00:01:55,284
began their season with a bench-clearing brawl,

30
00:01:55,359 --> 00:02:00,301
which wouldn't be that noteworthy except this brawl pitted the Ravens against the Ravens.

31
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:02,870
Even the cheerleaders got in a few good shots.

32
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:05,712
Looks like these kittens have claws.

33
00:02:05,799 --> 00:02:10,190
When asked about the incident, coach Brian "Whitey" Durham had no comment.

34
00:02:10,943 --> 00:02:12,887
I got a comment for you.

35
00:02:13,179 --> 00:02:15,972
Gym! Suicides! Move!

36
00:02:17,329 --> 00:02:22,856
Way I see it, you boys owe this school a major debt.

37
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:28,079
And you'll find that payback... is a bitch.

38
00:02:29,656 --> 00:02:32,315
And the currency is pain!

39
00:02:49,358 --> 00:02:50,681
Sleep well, honey?

40
00:02:51,447 --> 00:02:54,753
Funny thing... I woke up in the middle of the night to use the bathroom,

41
00:02:54,805 --> 00:02:56,353
and all the toilets were clogged.

42
00:02:56,953 --> 00:02:58,979
How are the toilets on your side of the house?

43
00:02:59,084 --> 00:03:01,102
Fine. Maybe you should call a plumber.

44
00:03:01,184 --> 00:03:02,769
Don't worry. I'll make due.

45
00:03:02,861 --> 00:03:03,581
Going for a swim?

46
00:03:03,662 --> 00:03:05,359
Nothing gets by you, Dan.

47
00:03:05,873 --> 00:03:08,873
Water's warm. You're in for a treat.

48
00:03:15,344 --> 00:03:17,549
Oh, hey, sorry. I'm just running late.

49
00:03:17,633 --> 00:03:18,116
It's cool.

50
00:03:18,204 --> 00:03:21,783
By the way, I don't know what was going on with you and Lucas at Midnight Madness,

51
00:03:21,859 --> 00:03:25,130
but I really wish you guys could get back to the way things used to be.

52
00:03:25,231 --> 00:03:27,126
This is the way things used to be, Haley.

53
00:03:27,212 --> 00:03:29,004
I meant before I left.

54
00:03:29,101 --> 00:03:30,510
What were you fighting about, anyway?

55
00:03:30,611 --> 00:03:31,623
You.

56
00:03:32,849 --> 00:03:35,324
So you're a cheerleader now? What's that all about?

57
00:03:35,349 --> 00:03:37,052
Uh, Brooke needed my help.

58
00:03:37,605 --> 00:03:39,527
Kind of glad I get to see more of you, though.

59
00:03:40,043 --> 00:03:43,582
It is okay with you? Not that I need your permission or anything, I just --

60
00:03:43,689 --> 00:03:47,007
You don't, but next time you want to talk, don't pretend to run in to me.

61
00:03:47,085 --> 00:03:50,093
Just talk to me, Hales. I don't want to play games.

62
00:03:50,525 --> 00:03:54,584
Uh-huh, you mean like other than challenging me to work with Chris again?

63
00:03:55,054 --> 00:03:57,020
Yeah, I guess -- I guess that's fair.

64
00:03:57,662 --> 00:03:58,859
So how's it going, anyway?

65
00:03:58,884 --> 00:04:02,122
I don't know. Coming along, I guess.

66
00:04:02,201 --> 00:04:03,743
Don't sleep on your music, Hales.

67
00:04:03,823 --> 00:04:05,246
It's a big part of who you are.

68
00:04:06,170 --> 00:04:07,091
Yeah.

69
00:04:08,807 --> 00:04:09,991
So are you.

70
00:04:10,505 --> 00:04:13,324
So, you gonna give me the damage report on you and Lucas?

71
00:04:13,404 --> 00:04:16,888
Let's see -- one boy, one car, one naked skeez in the back seat,

72
00:04:16,965 --> 00:04:18,638
and one Brooke Davis totally flipping out.

73
00:04:18,676 --> 00:04:20,703
Oh, Rachel stole your move, huh?

74
00:04:20,739 --> 00:04:22,793
Not the point.

75
00:04:22,882 --> 00:04:24,933
It just really set me off seeing them together.

76
00:04:25,017 --> 00:04:27,351
Even though you are the one that put them together.

77
00:04:27,443 --> 00:04:28,468
Way to twist the knife.

78
00:04:28,615 --> 00:04:32,101
The point is that she can't come in here and try to steal my squad and my boyfriend.

79
00:04:32,176 --> 00:04:32,955
Boyfriend?

80
00:04:33,046 --> 00:04:36,533
Isn't that a dirty word in the whole "keeping it casual" scenario?

81
00:04:36,748 --> 00:04:39,887
Yes. Okay, I know. I totally screwed this up.

82
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:41,729
But what am I supposed to say to him now?

83
00:04:41,805 --> 00:04:44,706
Well, see, there's this new thing out. It's called an "apology."

84
00:04:44,796 --> 00:04:47,755
All the cool kids are doing it. You might want to try it.

85
00:04:48,132 --> 00:04:52,184
You know, if you really get into trouble, try using the word "exclusive."

86
00:04:54,102 --> 00:04:54,965
Hey there.

87
00:04:57,755 --> 00:04:58,758
Um...

88
00:05:00,995 --> 00:05:02,710
Okay, look, I'm really sorry, Luke.

89
00:05:02,797 --> 00:05:05,198
I know that I came down on you really hard the other night,

90
00:05:05,276 --> 00:05:08,703
and I know that the whole date with Rachel was my idea, but

91
00:05:09,153 --> 00:05:11,073
I  do have feelings for you.

92
00:05:11,701 --> 00:05:15,072
Listen... I thought a lot about what you said the other night...

93
00:05:15,486 --> 00:05:17,371
you know, about what kind of guy you want me to be.

94
00:05:17,457 --> 00:05:19,657
And I want to be that guy for you.

95
00:05:19,758 --> 00:05:21,580
But you have to let me be that guy.

96
00:05:21,795 --> 00:05:24,725
If I say okay, do you promise to lower the weapon?

97
00:05:24,929 --> 00:05:25,780
Oh.

98
00:05:26,236 --> 00:05:27,145
Sorry.

99
00:05:28,146 --> 00:05:29,645
What you got there, anyway?

100
00:05:29,726 --> 00:05:31,697
Uh, flyers for my fantasy league.

101
00:05:31,783 --> 00:05:33,768
Hmm. Sounds kinky.

102
00:05:33,873 --> 00:05:35,601
Fantasy basketball league.

103
00:05:35,625 --> 00:05:38,486
Eh, sounds lame. How does it work?

104
00:05:38,599 --> 00:05:42,726
Well, there's a draft where you pick from a list of NBA players

105
00:05:42,969 --> 00:05:45,467
and build your own ideal fantasy team.

106
00:05:45,643 --> 00:05:51,274
So you get to pick and choose from a big group of hot, athletic guys.

107
00:05:51,365 --> 00:05:53,516
Definitely take that back -- not lame.

108
00:05:53,679 --> 00:05:56,252
Although you know there are better things to fantasize about.

109
00:05:56,335 --> 00:05:58,712
I don't have a girlfriend. What else is there?

110
00:06:04,009 --> 00:06:07,071
You liar! You knew I was gonna ask Fede out and you sniped him!

111
00:06:07,153 --> 00:06:08,404
Just 'cause he's in your cart doesn't mean

112
00:06:08,421 --> 00:06:10,274
I can't grab him before you get to the checkout line.

113
00:06:10,335 --> 00:06:11,411
Yeah, check this out.

114
00:06:14,459 --> 00:06:16,012
I could fantasize about this.

115
00:06:16,089 --> 00:06:17,947
Bevin! Ashley!

116
00:06:18,369 --> 00:06:19,160
Stop!

117
00:06:19,267 --> 00:06:20,381
Can't really blame them.

118
00:06:20,514 --> 00:06:23,797
I mean, they watched their captain go all "kung fu hustle" at Midnight Madness,

119
00:06:23,871 --> 00:06:26,648
and  now they all want to look like Brooke.

120
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:29,528
Of course, that would mean a trip to Goodwill.

121
00:06:30,511 --> 00:06:31,532
Hey, Luke.

122
00:06:34,417 --> 00:06:37,678
All right, Paris and Nicole. That's quite enough.

123
00:06:37,767 --> 00:06:41,202
If I wanted to watch cheerleaders wrestle, I'd turn on pay-per-view.

124
00:06:41,289 --> 00:06:43,367
It's okay, coach. I can handle them.

125
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:44,220
Is that a fact?

126
00:06:44,312 --> 00:06:46,974
Well, after your little melee at the Midnight Madness,

127
00:06:47,052 --> 00:06:49,905
principal Turner and I came to a meeting of the mind.

128
00:06:49,982 --> 00:06:53,395
Another fight like this, and there won't be any cheerleaders this season.

129
00:06:53,489 --> 00:06:56,083
Get your squad under control, miss Davis.

130
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:59,702
Otherwise you'll find yourself cheering for the chess team.

131
00:07:01,547 --> 00:07:03,896
Squad meeting -- now!

132
00:07:05,764 --> 00:07:10,158
This is my senior year, and as long as I am captain,

133
00:07:10,242 --> 00:07:14,993
I am not about to lose this squad because we are all fighting over the same guys.

134
00:07:15,079 --> 00:07:17,598
- Bevin knows I like Fede! 
- Fede's not into whores.

135
00:07:17,667 --> 00:07:18,986
Okay, enough!

136
00:07:21,428 --> 00:07:23,448
Do you have a problem?

137
00:07:24,126 --> 00:07:26,822
Just waiting to hear what your plan is, captain.

138
00:07:27,442 --> 00:07:28,932
"My plan."

139
00:07:29,839 --> 00:07:32,229
I'll tell you what my plan is.

140
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:35,849
We're waiting. Aren't we, girls?

141
00:07:37,374 --> 00:07:40,219
The plan is...

142
00:07:44,892 --> 00:07:47,046
...Fantasy boy draft.

143
00:08:00,353 --> 00:08:02,995
Okay, here's the rules of the Fantasy boy draft.

144
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:05,499
Once you pick a guy, he's yours for the season,

145
00:08:05,571 --> 00:08:09,607
which means he's off the market and no one else can touch him.

146
00:08:09,686 --> 00:08:11,598
Got it, Bevin? Ashley?

147
00:08:11,682 --> 00:08:12,456
What are these for?

148
00:08:12,557 --> 00:08:14,870
I'm glad you asked, trial-separation girl.

149
00:08:14,953 --> 00:08:16,039
Open 'em up.

150
00:08:16,119 --> 00:08:20,463
The number on your compact will determine where you are in the draft order.

151
00:08:20,545 --> 00:08:22,740
So what's to keep us from just dating whoever we want,

152
00:08:22,816 --> 00:08:24,156
even with this little draft thingy?

153
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,322
Good question, Bevin.

154
00:08:25,397 --> 00:08:27,486
Of course, you'd be kicked off the squad.

155
00:08:27,593 --> 00:08:28,885
Or worse...

156
00:08:29,741 --> 00:08:30,796
Like how worse?

157
00:08:30,969 --> 00:08:32,332
Like...

158
00:08:32,959 --> 00:08:37,158
what's to keep me from telling the whole school that one of you was left handcuffed

159
00:08:37,228 --> 00:08:40,612
to Ian Thomas' bed for seven hours, waiting for a locksmith?

160
00:08:40,709 --> 00:08:45,518
Or that at the sparkle classic last year, one of you had a little too much to drink

161
00:08:45,598 --> 00:08:48,425
and made out with another one of you?

162
00:08:48,524 --> 00:08:53,686
Or that that scar on a certain someone's back isn't reallyfrom falling off her bike,

163
00:08:53,778 --> 00:08:55,425
but was one of those little baby spine tails

164
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,849
that the doctors had to lop off after she was born?

165
00:08:57,935 --> 00:09:00,081
In other words -- honor.

166
00:09:00,179 --> 00:09:01,547
Code of silence.

167
00:09:01,641 --> 00:09:03,936
You all keep the rules of the code.

168
00:09:04,028 --> 00:09:06,674
I keep silent about all the dirt I have on all of you.

169
00:09:06,755 --> 00:09:08,779
Break the rules, and it's social suicide.

170
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:13,266
Final rule -- if at any time during the season you are not happy with your draft picks,

171
00:09:13,409 --> 00:09:15,573
you can trade someone else.

172
00:09:15,671 --> 00:09:18,803
Okay? Let's count out our numbers starting from one.

173
00:09:19,062 --> 00:09:19,844
One.

174
00:09:19,924 --> 00:09:22,402
Way to go, P. Sawyer, with pick numero uno.

175
00:09:22,478 --> 00:09:24,769
Right behind you with number two.

176
00:09:24,854 --> 00:09:25,923
Who's got three?

177
00:09:26,007 --> 00:09:27,590
- Three. 
- Uh, four.

178
00:09:27,819 --> 00:09:28,715
Five.

179
00:09:29,385 --> 00:09:30,339
So, wait.

180
00:09:30,417 --> 00:09:32,738
Once we pick our guy, then what happens?

181
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:34,467
It's up to you.

182
00:09:37,812 --> 00:09:39,498
- Hello, there.
- Hey.

183
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:41,173
All  quiet on the western front?

184
00:09:41,248 --> 00:09:43,651
Oh, not even close.

185
00:09:44,238 --> 00:09:47,378
Last night, I clogged the toilet on Dan's side of the house.

186
00:09:47,488 --> 00:09:49,799
Now he's even more full of crap than usual.

187
00:09:49,885 --> 00:09:51,184
I want to show you something.

188
00:09:51,273 --> 00:09:52,838
These are hot off the presses.

189
00:09:53,109 --> 00:09:54,098
Here you go.

190
00:09:54,241 --> 00:09:57,367
My first official "Roe for mayor" campaign poster.

191
00:09:57,458 --> 00:09:59,361
"Roe, Roe, Roe your vote"!

192
00:09:59,493 --> 00:10:00,802
It's cute.

193
00:10:15,244 --> 00:10:17,058
You're gonna need a bigger sign.

194
00:10:33,342 --> 00:10:37,260
Throughout the 19th century, China's emperors watched in dismay

195
00:10:37,346 --> 00:10:40,917
as foreigners encroached further and further into their lands.

196
00:10:41,014 --> 00:10:44,946
In the hopes of repelling this foreign invasion, the empress took the radical step

197
00:10:45,017 --> 00:10:49,642
of allying herself with former enemy insurgents known as the "boxers."

198
00:10:49,730 --> 00:10:54,008
Now, the boxers were a secret society who had previously waged war

199
00:10:54,086 --> 00:10:56,396
against China's imperial government.

200
00:10:56,483 --> 00:11:01,234
The empress believed that, by providing aid and support to the boxers,

201
00:11:01,349 --> 00:11:06,595
she could use this former enemy to expel the foreign intruders.

202
00:11:06,823 --> 00:11:09,158
Miss Davis, perhaps there's something in that note

203
00:11:09,213 --> 00:11:11,739
that could enlighten us about the boxer rebellion.

204
00:11:11,832 --> 00:11:15,212
Well... they totally won out over briefs.

205
00:11:19,418 --> 00:11:21,718
The purse -- let's have it.

206
00:11:21,817 --> 00:11:24,911
Um, excuse me, miss... miss...

207
00:11:25,246 --> 00:11:26,966
Sorry, I forgot your name.

208
00:11:28,016 --> 00:11:29,168
Jelline.

209
00:11:29,248 --> 00:11:30,818
Right. My bad.

210
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:32,842
In New Jersey vs. T.L.O.,

211
00:11:32,937 --> 00:11:35,430
the supreme court ruled that unless a law has been broken

212
00:11:35,509 --> 00:11:38,281
or there is probable cause to suspect a law has been broken,

213
00:11:38,352 --> 00:11:42,686
searches and/or seizures of students' property is unlawful.

214
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:46,725
And last time I checked, not paying attention in class wasn't a crime.

215
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:07,577
Pretty sweet legal moves, counselor.

216
00:12:07,686 --> 00:12:09,923
You should see my not-so-legal moves.

217
00:12:11,646 --> 00:12:12,610
H ey.

218
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:14,939
Do you actually think I need your help?

219
00:12:15,030 --> 00:12:17,249
Well, I guess that's a "thank you" in Brooke world.

220
00:12:17,337 --> 00:12:19,817
Look, you got something right. It is my world.

221
00:12:19,916 --> 00:12:21,465
And you may have my whole squad fooled,

222
00:12:21,542 --> 00:12:24,283
but if you are trying to suck up to me, don't bother.

223
00:12:26,255 --> 00:12:28,178
Hey, she did kind of bail you out back there.

224
00:12:28,277 --> 00:12:30,473
You are not allowed to defend her.

225
00:12:30,549 --> 00:12:34,389
In fact, I would appreciate if you didn't associate with her -- clothed or otherwise.

226
00:12:34,493 --> 00:12:36,875
Does this mean you're gonna pick me in your fantasy draft?

227
00:12:36,921 --> 00:12:38,066
How did you know about that?

228
00:12:38,184 --> 00:12:41,723
Oh, come on -- from three rows back, I still know what a fantasy draft looks like.

229
00:12:41,823 --> 00:12:43,097
I admit nothing.

230
00:12:43,199 --> 00:12:46,120
It's just a plan to keep the rest of my squad from tearing each other's heads off.

231
00:12:46,202 --> 00:12:51,729
Really? You sure it's not about Brooke Davis having her cake and... dating it, too?

232
00:12:51,821 --> 00:12:53,361
Could  be. Could not be.

233
00:12:53,485 --> 00:12:57,372
I'll let you know if we need to schedule a private workout for research.

234
00:13:01,307 --> 00:13:03,436
Saw the NOFX sticker on your locker.

235
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:04,983
Figured you'd be into this.

236
00:13:05,067 --> 00:13:07,911
Super-rare bootleg recorded straight off the mixing board.

237
00:13:07,995 --> 00:13:10,380
Right. Look, Rachel, Brooke's my best friend.

238
00:13:10,469 --> 00:13:12,309
So you can try to buy her off with your legal jargon,

239
00:13:12,389 --> 00:13:14,820
but you can't buy me off with a bootleg.

240
00:13:15,130 --> 00:13:18,370
Peyton, I'm offering to let you borrow a CD.

241
00:13:18,453 --> 00:13:20,092
You got anything else, it's your baggage.

242
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:22,956
Honestly, I'm just surprised a cheerleader's into punk.

243
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:25,322
I didn't think anybody was that screwed up.

244
00:13:25,412 --> 00:13:27,077
I mean, besides me.

245
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:32,033
Come on, Peyton. I'm trying here.

246
00:13:32,126 --> 00:13:35,213
You do realize I'm the one that tackled you at Midnight Madness?

247
00:13:35,305 --> 00:13:39,184
Yeah, but I heard the rumors. I just figured you were into me.

248
00:13:40,458 --> 00:13:43,393
Look, I get it. Some people just don't get along.

249
00:13:43,479 --> 00:13:45,873
Being friends with me does not mean you're betraying Brooke.

250
00:13:45,965 --> 00:13:48,031
You don't know Brooke very well, do you?

251
00:13:49,082 --> 00:13:51,211
Come on. You know you want to hear it.

252
00:13:52,034 --> 00:13:53,308
No, thanks.

253
00:14:16,501 --> 00:14:18,886
Oh, man. Lucas looks really tired.

254
00:14:18,978 --> 00:14:21,530
Well, I certainly haven't been keeping him up at night.

255
00:14:21,654 --> 00:14:25,168
Of course, that could all change after the boy draft.

256
00:14:26,026 --> 00:14:28,370
All right, I got to go. Keep an eye on him, huh?

257
00:14:28,462 --> 00:14:29,452
I will.

258
00:14:30,176 --> 00:14:31,461
Maybe two.

259
00:14:40,493 --> 00:14:42,587
You making some notes on potential draft picks?

260
00:14:42,647 --> 00:14:43,751
Not really.

261
00:14:44,062 --> 00:14:46,163
Wow, she's pretty. Who is she?

262
00:14:46,259 --> 00:14:47,514
Wish I knew.

263
00:14:47,701 --> 00:14:48,903
So, what's up, Mouth?

264
00:14:48,988 --> 00:14:51,475
The draft. Everybody's talking about it.

265
00:14:51,562 --> 00:14:55,243
I was just wondering... any chance a guy like me has a shot at getting picked?

266
00:14:55,330 --> 00:14:58,858
Come on, Mouth. What are you talking about? You're a total catch.

267
00:14:58,953 --> 00:15:01,262
I guarantee someone's gonna pick you.

268
00:15:01,346 --> 00:15:04,161
Besides, you'll probably be the only guy left alive.

269
00:15:06,214 --> 00:15:07,479
Lucas Scott!

270
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:10,517
Why don't you hop on your brother's back and let him carry you?

271
00:15:10,647 --> 00:15:13,379
All right, gentlemen, line up. Let's do it again.

272
00:15:13,486 --> 00:15:16,538
There's a reason they call these 16-60s.

273
00:15:16,552 --> 00:15:21,913
Each one of you has to touch that sideline 16 times in 60 seconds.

274
00:15:22,001 --> 00:15:24,108
If one of you fails to do it,

275
00:15:24,196 --> 00:15:26,033
then you all do it again.

276
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:29,437
Better get your ass in shape. You'll be the only captain in the league riding the bench.

277
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:31,819
Come on, baby. We're in this together.

278
00:15:37,098 --> 00:15:38,849
- Bevin!
- Hi!

279
00:15:38,987 --> 00:15:42,957
So... why wasn't Rachel scouting for the fantasy draft today?

280
00:15:43,041 --> 00:15:45,953
She said she didn't have to. She knows who she's gonna pick.

281
00:15:46,174 --> 00:15:48,659
And... who might that be?

282
00:15:48,752 --> 00:15:50,900
She kind of made me promise I wouldn't tell anybody.

283
00:15:50,984 --> 00:15:52,227
Okay.

284
00:15:52,378 --> 00:15:57,068
Bev, I know you guys have become... fast friends, and that's cool.

285
00:15:57,153 --> 00:16:00,285
You probably want to be... loyal...

286
00:16:00,446 --> 00:16:02,265
not betray her.

287
00:16:02,366 --> 00:16:03,482
Chris Keller.

288
00:16:04,767 --> 00:16:07,111
Wait. Chris Keller?

289
00:16:07,185 --> 00:16:09,385
Yeah. Rachel met him at the record store.

290
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:11,400
She's got a thing for musicians.

291
00:16:11,486 --> 00:16:13,604
Plus, she said he's really, really sweet.

292
00:16:13,707 --> 00:16:14,912
It sucks, Haley.

293
00:16:14,993 --> 00:16:18,022
Wha -- I worked really hard on that song. What do you mean, "it sucks"?

294
00:16:18,096 --> 00:16:22,412
I mean it sucks so bad, I'm wondering if it's possible to un-hear a song.

295
00:16:22,502 --> 00:16:24,846
Maybe it's the song that's good, and it's you that sucks.

296
00:16:24,916 --> 00:16:26,409
Yeah, maybe. Let me think.

297
00:16:26,494 --> 00:16:28,577
Um... no. It's the song.

298
00:16:28,679 --> 00:16:31,298
The one good thing about it -- besides the fact that it's over --

299
00:16:31,395 --> 00:16:33,428
is now that you've gotten all the crap out of your system,

300
00:16:33,499 --> 00:16:35,122
you can write something real.

301
00:16:35,782 --> 00:16:37,946
You got to write the truth, Hales.

302
00:16:38,243 --> 00:16:39,827
How are things with Nathan?

303
00:16:41,701 --> 00:16:43,823
I'm not discussing that with you.

304
00:16:44,481 --> 00:16:46,387
Ooh. That bad, huh?

305
00:16:46,472 --> 00:16:48,146
No. Things are fine.

306
00:16:49,052 --> 00:16:51,097
I don't think they are.

307
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:53,449
I think things are a mess, Haley.

308
00:16:53,651 --> 00:16:56,846
And until you deal with that, your music's gonna suffer.

309
00:17:03,271 --> 00:17:04,901
Look who it is.

310
00:17:05,002 --> 00:17:07,590
I didn't know if you went to this school no more, dog.

311
00:17:07,671 --> 00:17:09,695
You've been spending too much time in the art center.

312
00:17:09,792 --> 00:17:12,055
Might do you some good to hang out with us non-gifted kids.

313
00:17:12,133 --> 00:17:13,155
Ah, whatever.

314
00:17:13,232 --> 00:17:15,170
Don't be acting like you ain't been busy.

315
00:17:15,281 --> 00:17:18,492
I thought I was gonna have to hide butt naked in your back seat to get your attention.

316
00:17:18,587 --> 00:17:19,532
You heard about that?

317
00:17:19,617 --> 00:17:21,934
The whole school heard about that, dog.

318
00:17:22,042 --> 00:17:23,761
But I mean, you could share the wealth.

319
00:17:23,841 --> 00:17:26,343
First Brooke Davis. Now the new redhead.

320
00:17:26,417 --> 00:17:28,874
I mean, you do know why the back seat was invented, right?

321
00:17:28,964 --> 00:17:31,205
Uh, yeah. I think I was conceived in one.

322
00:17:31,668 --> 00:17:32,958
Good point.

323
00:17:33,531 --> 00:17:36,225
But on the real, man -- how you holding up? You good?

324
00:17:36,448 --> 00:17:37,343
What do you mean?

325
00:17:37,445 --> 00:17:39,735
First half of the summer, you play like straight trash,

326
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:42,220
then, bam, you're back to the old Luke. What's going on?

327
00:17:42,330 --> 00:17:44,544
Nothing. Just finally getting in shape.

328
00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:46,204
Right.

329
00:17:46,530 --> 00:17:48,772
And that wouldn't have nothing to do with your heart condition

330
00:17:48,855 --> 00:17:50,479
your moms got worked up about?

331
00:17:50,563 --> 00:17:53,277
HCM. No, I tested negative.

332
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:57,978
Luke, I know you love the game, dog.

333
00:17:58,104 --> 00:18:00,257
Just like I love the game.

334
00:18:00,512 --> 00:18:03,149
But the people in your life -- they love you more.

335
00:18:03,265 --> 00:18:04,485
You do understand that, right?

336
00:18:04,807 --> 00:18:07,664
Yeah. Skills, I get it, all right? I'll be fine.

337
00:18:07,763 --> 00:18:08,830
A'ight, man.

338
00:18:09,876 --> 00:18:10,546
What?

339
00:18:10,633 --> 00:18:11,930
Yo, check this out.

340
00:18:13,018 --> 00:18:15,974
Shorty been checking me out all week, son.

341
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:19,529
Yeah, there's this boy draft thing.

342
00:18:19,630 --> 00:18:20,814
Yeah, I heard.

343
00:18:21,507 --> 00:18:25,863
But on the real, last time somebody was following me around like that,

344
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:27,921
I was in a department store.

345
00:18:28,076 --> 00:18:29,152
Straight up.

346
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,690
Brooke, that's amazing!

347
00:18:33,791 --> 00:18:35,482
Now, what exactly did your manager say?

348
00:18:35,575 --> 00:18:38,865
Well, she said she showed my clothing designs to all the corporate monkeys

349
00:18:38,931 --> 00:18:42,194
at Suburban Filth, and they totally responded.

350
00:18:42,292 --> 00:18:45,757
Now all I need is Rachel to die of T.S.S. and life will be perfect.

351
00:18:46,865 --> 00:18:50,011
Have you noticed how all the guys have been acting stepford-ish lately?

352
00:18:50,113 --> 00:18:52,143
It's the draft. We have the first two picks.

353
00:18:52,238 --> 00:18:54,889
We should have done this years ago. Now we have the power.

354
00:18:54,982 --> 00:18:58,969
So that's why you rigged the draft order. So you could lock up Lucas exclusively.

355
00:18:59,055 --> 00:19:01,279
Uh, maybe. Okay, probably.

356
00:19:01,378 --> 00:19:02,311
What about you?

357
00:19:02,414 --> 00:19:04,498
Any chance Jake's gonna turn up by friday?

358
00:19:04,595 --> 00:19:06,755
Uh... sorry, buddy.

359
00:19:07,079 --> 00:19:08,232
But fear not.

360
00:19:08,325 --> 00:19:10,745
Every boy here wants to be the first pick in the draft.

361
00:19:10,831 --> 00:19:12,357
Oh, you think?

362
00:19:12,494 --> 00:19:13,570
Watch this.

363
00:19:21,074 --> 00:19:22,115
Thank you.

364
00:19:27,374 --> 00:19:28,212
Hey!

365
00:19:29,225 --> 00:19:32,285
Never expected the cheerleading squad to have more drama than the drama club.

366
00:19:32,383 --> 00:19:33,837
What did you expect from cheerleading?

367
00:19:33,921 --> 00:19:36,365
I don't know. It was a spur-of-the-moment decision.

368
00:19:36,455 --> 00:19:38,360
I'm  glad I get to see more of Nathan and you guys.

369
00:19:38,438 --> 00:19:41,552
I just don't know how I'm gonna balance this with doing the music thing with Chris.

370
00:19:41,642 --> 00:19:42,857
You're working with Chris again?

371
00:19:42,966 --> 00:19:43,772
Yeah, actually --

372
00:19:43,867 --> 00:19:46,136
You know, for someone that wants to stay close to Nathan,

373
00:19:46,218 --> 00:19:49,702
spending time with the guy that drove you apart is a hell of a way to show it.

374
00:19:55,096 --> 00:19:57,643
Ooh, we got a door-holder at 2:00.

375
00:19:57,725 --> 00:19:59,997
Chivalrous and a good dresser.

376
00:20:00,846 --> 00:20:01,830
That's Smitty.

377
00:20:01,933 --> 00:20:04,327
And he shoots for the other team. Sorry.

378
00:20:04,998 --> 00:20:07,429
I already know who I'm drafting, but I thought you guys could use

379
00:20:07,453 --> 00:20:09,071
these scouting reports I put together --

380
00:20:09,158 --> 00:20:11,796
every guy's stats, cross-referenced with dating histories...

381
00:20:11,887 --> 00:20:14,007
and stuff written on bathroom stalls.

382
00:20:14,089 --> 00:20:15,093
Nice!

383
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:17,992
Thanks.

384
00:20:20,807 --> 00:20:23,058
Oh, I'm drafting the hell out of that.

385
00:20:23,149 --> 00:20:24,050
Absolutely.

386
00:20:24,138 --> 00:20:25,655
Rachel, you rock.

387
00:21:34,125 --> 00:21:37,490
Hi. Okay, ready? Okay, that's great. Thank you.

388
00:21:37,570 --> 00:21:38,488
Next.

389
00:21:38,595 --> 00:21:39,936
Hi. Okay.

390
00:21:40,071 --> 00:21:41,825
Okay, that's great. Thank you.

391
00:21:43,196 --> 00:21:44,037
Hi.

392
00:21:44,149 --> 00:21:46,228
Oh, that's great. Hold it right there.

393
00:21:50,245 --> 00:21:52,405
Mouth, can you do me a favor?

394
00:21:52,489 --> 00:21:53,832
Sure, snap away.

395
00:21:53,982 --> 00:21:55,109
Uh, no.

396
00:21:55,281 --> 00:21:56,763
Can you move out of the way?

397
00:22:01,579 --> 00:22:03,828
All right, ready? Okay, here we go again.

398
00:22:17,410 --> 00:22:19,869
Looking a little tired there, Lucas.

399
00:22:21,023 --> 00:22:23,268
Maybe you don't have the heart for this.

400
00:22:23,787 --> 00:22:24,981
What do you want?

401
00:22:25,065 --> 00:22:27,307
I want you to talk some sense into your mother.

402
00:22:27,616 --> 00:22:29,525
Tell her to drop out of the mayor's race.

403
00:22:29,650 --> 00:22:30,820
Why?

404
00:22:31,490 --> 00:22:33,155
You afraid of the competition?

405
00:22:33,229 --> 00:22:35,772
I would be, if there actually was a competition.

406
00:22:36,788 --> 00:22:39,132
Then again, blowouts are kind of fun.

407
00:22:39,510 --> 00:22:40,937
Just talk to her.

408
00:22:41,596 --> 00:22:43,711
That is, if you can catch your breath.

409
00:22:58,848 --> 00:23:00,122
You want to touch it?

410
00:23:00,286 --> 00:23:02,657
- No, I was just, um --
- Come on.

411
00:23:02,956 --> 00:23:05,268
Come on -- check out my assets.

412
00:23:05,775 --> 00:23:08,440
Touch the Skills hills.

413
00:23:18,036 --> 00:23:20,693
You know "Skills" got two "ls" in it, right?

414
00:23:38,088 --> 00:23:40,449
You're late. Kind of pushing it, aren't you?

415
00:23:40,535 --> 00:23:41,904
That makes two of us.

416
00:23:42,001 --> 00:23:43,518
I was at the library doing research,

417
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:46,677
I think I figured out why you've been having trouble at practice.

418
00:23:46,753 --> 00:23:48,274
- Hi, Haley. 
- Hi!

419
00:23:50,197 --> 00:23:52,813
I found this web site that said sluggish physical performance

420
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:55,046
is one of the side effects of the HCM medication.

421
00:23:55,123 --> 00:23:58,133
It's bad enough you haven't told your mom, but I really think you should talk to Whitey.

422
00:23:58,210 --> 00:23:59,160
I can handle it.

423
00:23:59,242 --> 00:24:02,814
Luke... players have collapsed and died because of this, okay?

424
00:24:02,892 --> 00:24:05,024
You need to tell Whitey about your heart.

425
00:24:05,108 --> 00:24:07,294
I don't know if I can do that.

426
00:24:08,678 --> 00:24:12,408
Well, I know one thing. If you don't talk to him, I will.

427
00:24:22,863 --> 00:24:25,762
Janis Joplin. Now, she's a great songwriter.

428
00:24:26,213 --> 00:24:28,397
I wonder if it's possible to un-meet a person.

429
00:24:28,495 --> 00:24:31,505
I was being honest, like all the great songwriters are --

430
00:24:31,596 --> 00:24:33,027
like you need to be.

431
00:24:34,278 --> 00:24:38,546
Look, take Eric Clapton. All of his best songs came from pain and longing.

432
00:24:39,127 --> 00:24:41,641
"Layla" -- about his best friend's woman.

433
00:24:42,055 --> 00:24:43,643
"Tears in heaven" for his son.

434
00:24:43,719 --> 00:24:46,821
Thank you for the pep talk, but I need to get back to this if you don't mind --

435
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:49,373
No, you didn't put my name up there.

436
00:24:51,766 --> 00:24:54,155
Chris, that wall is for great musicians.

437
00:24:54,268 --> 00:24:55,226
I know.

438
00:24:55,387 --> 00:24:57,183
I do not belong up here.

439
00:24:57,496 --> 00:25:00,535
If you stop running from your emotion and start writing about it,

440
00:25:00,881 --> 00:25:02,383
one day you might.

441
00:25:15,130 --> 00:25:16,641
No morning swim today?

442
00:25:16,854 --> 00:25:17,789
Nope.

443
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:22,998
I guess you'll be on the campaign trail all day today?

444
00:25:23,651 --> 00:25:24,828
That's right.

445
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:27,378
Got to run.

446
00:25:28,472 --> 00:25:29,907
I'll bet.

447
00:25:30,549 --> 00:25:32,851
Mayoral election to be a Dan-slide?

448
00:25:33,775 --> 00:25:36,323
Did you get a look at the first election polls?

449
00:25:36,436 --> 00:25:38,182
It's almost like I'm running unopposed.

450
00:25:38,273 --> 00:25:39,893
Go away, Dan.

451
00:25:39,976 --> 00:25:42,004
No, no. You keep it -- my treat.

452
00:25:42,091 --> 00:25:43,940
I've never taken anything from you before.

453
00:25:44,035 --> 00:25:45,564
Why start now?

454
00:25:45,734 --> 00:25:47,768
Great. I can use the change for the meter.

455
00:25:47,844 --> 00:25:51,140
You worried, Dan? I mean, why else would you even bother coming in here?

456
00:25:51,231 --> 00:25:53,818
Afraid what will happen once the voters get to know me?

457
00:25:53,906 --> 00:25:56,296
But they won't, Karen. Think about it.

458
00:25:56,393 --> 00:25:59,038
Do you even have the resources to wage an effective campaign?

459
00:25:59,113 --> 00:26:00,995
Do you have the respect of the community?

460
00:26:01,084 --> 00:26:02,248
Do you --

461
00:26:05,917 --> 00:26:07,409
Do you have a bathroom?

462
00:26:13,689 --> 00:26:16,571
So, I guess you survived Whitey's practice.

463
00:26:16,641 --> 00:26:19,174
Seems like he's been pretty tough on you guys. How you holding up?

464
00:26:19,255 --> 00:26:22,058
I can roll with it. I've been meaning to ask you the same question, though.

465
00:26:22,137 --> 00:26:25,662
Caught your latest podcast. I didn't realize the situation with your mom was so --

466
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:28,924
Yeah. But, you know, I can roll with it.

467
00:26:29,003 --> 00:26:31,728
Just as long as you know you don't have to roll solo.

468
00:26:32,053 --> 00:26:33,592
So, you ready for this draft thing?

469
00:26:33,673 --> 00:26:35,081
Yeah. Any chance I won't get picked?

470
00:26:35,173 --> 00:26:37,427
Um, let's see. I have the first pick -- whoo-hoo --

471
00:26:37,497 --> 00:26:40,848
and then you're safe with Brooke and Bevin, but then there's the fourth pick --

472
00:26:40,937 --> 00:26:41,926
your wife.

473
00:26:42,016 --> 00:26:43,032
Yeah.

474
00:26:43,151 --> 00:26:45,800
Look, if you're not ready to go on a date with Haley,

475
00:26:45,879 --> 00:26:47,886
I can pick you, okay, but it's your call.

476
00:26:47,961 --> 00:26:49,773
So you tell me.

477
00:26:49,862 --> 00:26:51,907
Do you want Haley to pick you?

478
00:26:57,141 --> 00:27:00,816
Well, well. The tortoise finally crosses the finish line.

479
00:27:00,907 --> 00:27:04,968
Don't you mean the hare? The tortoise finished first.

480
00:27:05,078 --> 00:27:07,362
You couldn't beat either one of them.

481
00:27:08,090 --> 00:27:12,962
Look... there's a reason I've been lagging behind, coach.

482
00:27:19,432 --> 00:27:20,830
I'm out of shape.

483
00:27:22,081 --> 00:27:24,474
I'll do whatever it takes to get it back.

484
00:27:24,592 --> 00:27:27,485
It's not fair to take it out on the team. They don't deserve it.

485
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:30,060
If you have to take it out on someone...

486
00:27:30,709 --> 00:27:32,383
take it out on me.

487
00:27:35,907 --> 00:27:37,190
Don't worry, son.

488
00:27:40,155 --> 00:27:41,992
I'll take care of you.

489
00:27:42,344 --> 00:27:46,203
Seems I've been unfairly riding you guys a little too hard lately --

490
00:27:46,269 --> 00:27:49,212
at least, according to your co-captain, Lucas Scott.

491
00:27:49,295 --> 00:27:51,320
So he's taking today's practice off

492
00:27:51,408 --> 00:27:54,684
so he can catch up on his sleepy-sleepy time.

493
00:27:54,754 --> 00:27:56,275
Go have a seat.

494
00:27:58,154 --> 00:28:06,399
While your co-captain is kicked back, enjoying a cold drink and having a mani-pedi,

495
00:28:06,465 --> 00:28:09,487
the rest of you are gonna work twice as hard.

496
00:28:09,552 --> 00:28:13,049
All right, to the sidelines -- now! Get moving! Go! Go! Go!

497
00:28:17,303 --> 00:28:19,144
What the hell's the matter with you, man?

498
00:28:21,017 --> 00:28:23,001
All right ! Let's move, move !

499
00:28:44,530 --> 00:28:45,458
Hi, Haley.

500
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:46,765
Hey. Hi.

501
00:28:46,865 --> 00:28:50,435
Um, I was just wondering -- how are things with you and Nathan?

502
00:28:50,526 --> 00:28:53,477
Uh... complicated.

503
00:28:53,555 --> 00:28:55,472
But I'm not gonna give up on him.

504
00:28:55,553 --> 00:28:58,054
You go, Hales. Good for you.

505
00:28:58,754 --> 00:29:00,329
He's a no-go, girls.

506
00:29:01,059 --> 00:29:04,325
Bevin, Nathan's my husband. You can't seriously be thinking of drafting him.

507
00:29:04,404 --> 00:29:06,505
Yeah, Bevin, you can't draft Nathan.

508
00:29:07,191 --> 00:29:08,632
Thanks, Peyton.

509
00:29:08,973 --> 00:29:11,730
'Cause I have first pick, and I'm taking him.

510
00:29:23,224 --> 00:29:24,430
Look, ho-bot.

511
00:29:24,518 --> 00:29:26,196
This is a poser-free zone.

512
00:29:26,684 --> 00:29:27,916
What's wrong, Brookie?

513
00:29:28,001 --> 00:29:29,549
Jealous 'cause "the Keller" isn't into you?

514
00:29:29,630 --> 00:29:32,888
I wouldn't let "the Keller" into me if he were the la--

515
00:29:33,864 --> 00:29:35,974
Oh, my god! I love your necklace.

516
00:29:36,065 --> 00:29:37,999
And your shoes are so fetch!

517
00:29:38,193 --> 00:29:41,185
I'm glad to see you girls have patched things up.

518
00:29:41,264 --> 00:29:43,168
Oh, yeah. We're totally "beaches."

519
00:29:43,246 --> 00:29:46,503
Oh, you know, if you girls refer to each other that way,

520
00:29:46,586 --> 00:29:48,916
the boys are gonna think it's all right to do the same.

521
00:29:48,996 --> 00:29:51,651
No, coach -- "beaches," like the movie.

522
00:29:51,743 --> 00:29:52,790
Oh.

523
00:29:52,993 --> 00:29:54,861
Well, carry on.

524
00:29:56,808 --> 00:29:57,601
"Fetch"?

525
00:29:57,677 --> 00:29:59,765
Yeah. You know, something a dog does.

526
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:02,342
Hey, hey, how do you feel about the mathletes?

527
00:30:02,419 --> 00:30:05,898
'Cause that's who you're gonna be cheering for if you don't quit cage-matching it out with Rachel.

528
00:30:05,961 --> 00:30:09,240
Why don't you just put the "leader" back in "cheerleader" and make peace with her?

529
00:30:09,325 --> 00:30:11,139
You know, Peyton, I will.

530
00:30:11,242 --> 00:30:13,293
Just as soon as you make peace with Haley.

531
00:30:13,383 --> 00:30:14,476
That's what I thought.

532
00:30:14,567 --> 00:30:17,118
And P.S., you cannot draft Nathan. He's Haley's.

533
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:20,009
No, he was. Then she skipped town.

534
00:30:20,118 --> 00:30:21,209
They're married.

535
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:24,924
This is bad stuff, P. Sawyer. Isn't there anybody else that you could pick?

536
00:30:25,008 --> 00:30:27,492
Well, yeah. There's Lucas.

537
00:30:27,570 --> 00:30:29,654
Oh, no. On second thought, Nathan's a great idea.

538
00:30:31,895 --> 00:30:35,135
So, I guess it's safe to say that you didn't talk to Whitey.

539
00:30:37,528 --> 00:30:39,005
It's fine. I'll tell him.

540
00:30:39,803 --> 00:30:40,923
Haley!

541
00:30:43,073 --> 00:30:44,487
Look, you don't get it.

542
00:30:44,886 --> 00:30:47,576
If you tell Whitey I have a heart condition,

543
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:49,061
I'm off the team.

544
00:30:49,155 --> 00:30:51,592
Yeah. And if I don't tell Whitey about your heart condition,

545
00:30:51,668 --> 00:30:53,356
you're off the planet.

546
00:30:53,441 --> 00:30:54,696
Haley...

547
00:30:55,256 --> 00:30:58,352
for the longest time, I have been an outsider.

548
00:30:58,525 --> 00:31:01,103
When I joined this team and the guys accepted me,

549
00:31:01,193 --> 00:31:04,361
I became part of something, and it's something I care about.

550
00:31:04,450 --> 00:31:06,162
I know, Luke.

551
00:31:06,871 --> 00:31:09,432
I'm not gonna die if I take the pills.

552
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:13,281
I just have to work hard to compensate for the medication.

553
00:31:13,366 --> 00:31:17,538
Luke, will you listen to yourself? The medication is supposed to inhibit your performance.

554
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:19,322
That is how it saves your life.

555
00:31:19,410 --> 00:31:22,223
"I am the master of my fate. I am the captain of my soul."

556
00:31:22,743 --> 00:31:23,774
What?

557
00:31:24,788 --> 00:31:27,995
William Henley, "Invictus." It's latin --

558
00:31:28,099 --> 00:31:30,403
Invincible. Yeah, I know. I know the poem.

559
00:31:30,470 --> 00:31:33,796
I also know that William Henley didn't have a heart condition. Luke, you're not...

560
00:31:33,866 --> 00:31:35,739
You're not invincible!

561
00:31:39,432 --> 00:31:41,668
I just hope you live long enough to realize it.

562
00:31:50,553 --> 00:31:54,037
For your consideration. I would make an excellent sleeper pick.

563
00:31:54,125 --> 00:31:55,305
Ew, gross!

564
00:31:55,402 --> 00:31:57,446
No, it doesn't mean that. It just mean...

565
00:31:59,576 --> 00:32:00,541
Cookie?

566
00:32:01,987 --> 00:32:03,202
They're fresh-baked.

567
00:32:03,214 --> 00:32:04,119
Sure.

568
00:32:04,305 --> 00:32:05,735
- Hey!
- Hi, Haley.

569
00:32:13,443 --> 00:32:16,493
I just want you to know that you're wasting your time drafting Nathan.

570
00:32:16,593 --> 00:32:18,160
You can pick him. I can't stop you.

571
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:20,990
But, um, I'm not going anywhere, Peyton.

572
00:32:21,091 --> 00:32:23,999
Nathan and I are meant to be together. I know that. You know that.

573
00:32:24,122 --> 00:32:26,417
And one of these days, he's gonna know that, too.

574
00:32:33,175 --> 00:32:34,881
Who wants cupcakes?

575
00:32:45,892 --> 00:32:47,909
Has everybody seen my new wall?

576
00:32:48,021 --> 00:32:50,528
It's, um... it's of the French Riviera.

577
00:32:51,372 --> 00:32:54,004
Italian Riviera, actually.

578
00:32:54,288 --> 00:32:56,663
Uh, excuse me. It's my wall.

579
00:32:56,757 --> 00:32:59,624
Well, your wall is of the Portofino Harbor.

580
00:32:59,721 --> 00:33:01,503
We va-cay there every year.

581
00:33:03,915 --> 00:33:05,459
See? Here?

582
00:33:05,566 --> 00:33:07,605
That's the Splendido Mare.

583
00:33:07,865 --> 00:33:10,705
I met the hottest guy while staying there.

584
00:33:15,744 --> 00:33:17,684
So, you two bury the hatchet yet?

585
00:33:17,770 --> 00:33:20,178
Funny thing -- I'm about to bury it in her throat.

586
00:33:21,859 --> 00:33:22,898
Brooke gave it to me.

587
00:33:28,373 --> 00:33:29,976
So, considering I'm an honors student,

588
00:33:30,055 --> 00:33:32,922
how many years do you think I would get if I stabbed someone -- say, Peyton --

589
00:33:33,009 --> 00:33:35,643
with, like, a... giant fork?

590
00:33:35,746 --> 00:33:38,136
Okay, let's not keep sharp objects around the house.

591
00:33:38,215 --> 00:33:40,180
I know that this whole thing with Nathan sucks for you,

592
00:33:40,202 --> 00:33:42,150
but right now, I need your help bringing Rachel to her knees.

593
00:33:42,205 --> 00:33:43,511
Yes, I know, it's ironic.

594
00:33:43,591 --> 00:33:45,986
Here's my plan -- I'm gonna snipe her draft pick.

595
00:33:46,058 --> 00:33:48,655
She needs to know what it feels like when the shoe's up the other ass.

596
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:51,671
Okay. What do you need from me? And do not say my shoes.

597
00:33:51,751 --> 00:33:54,263
No. Rachel picks fifth. You pick fourth.

598
00:33:54,284 --> 00:33:57,162
I need you to pick Lucas so no one else gets him while I'm screwing her over.

599
00:33:57,187 --> 00:33:58,459
What about Bevin? She's third.

600
00:33:58,539 --> 00:33:59,989
Yeah, but she's picking Skills.

601
00:34:00,246 --> 00:34:01,421
We got a deal?

602
00:34:01,627 --> 00:34:04,122
Well, if I can't have Nathan, I might as well take Lucas.

603
00:34:05,074 --> 00:34:05,834
Deal.

604
00:34:15,916 --> 00:34:17,325
Well, well.

605
00:34:17,418 --> 00:34:18,855
What do you say, partner?

606
00:34:19,319 --> 00:34:21,398
Here's half the money for Haley's studio time.

607
00:34:21,766 --> 00:34:23,358
I'll get you the rest next week.

608
00:34:25,182 --> 00:34:27,316
You ever heard of Robert Johnson, Nate?

609
00:34:29,795 --> 00:34:32,257
Sure. He's a forward for the Oregon Ducks.

610
00:34:33,722 --> 00:34:34,909
No.

611
00:34:35,545 --> 00:34:38,687
Robert Johnson was a blues man back in the '30s.

612
00:34:38,801 --> 00:34:42,276
The story goes, he made a deal with the devil for the gift of music.

613
00:34:42,372 --> 00:34:44,284
Kind of like you're doing for Haley.

614
00:34:44,675 --> 00:34:46,223
So what, you're supposed to be the devil?

615
00:34:46,301 --> 00:34:47,957
No, man. I'm Robert Johnson.

616
00:34:48,042 --> 00:34:49,446
You're the devil.

617
00:34:52,551 --> 00:34:53,937
So, how's Haley doing?

618
00:34:54,046 --> 00:34:56,269
Not well. How are you and Haley doing?

619
00:34:56,433 --> 00:34:58,179
Let's get something straight.

620
00:34:58,545 --> 00:35:00,906
I'm here to talk about Haley and her music,

621
00:35:00,991 --> 00:35:02,572
not Haley and me.

622
00:35:02,998 --> 00:35:04,831
You still don't get it, do you?

623
00:35:05,363 --> 00:35:07,164
They're the same thing.

624
00:35:09,645 --> 00:35:11,527
Could we just pull the blinds or something?

625
00:35:12,014 --> 00:35:12,867
Nope.

626
00:35:13,190 --> 00:35:16,277
Keeps me focused on how badly I need to beat him.

627
00:35:16,371 --> 00:35:18,341
Yeah. I saw him today.

628
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:20,482
He's not gonna make it easy on you, you know.

629
00:35:20,679 --> 00:35:22,349
Is that what he told you?

630
00:35:22,649 --> 00:35:23,982
More or less.

631
00:35:26,044 --> 00:35:27,656
You know, Lucas, I...

632
00:35:27,768 --> 00:35:31,554
I may not have the money or the connections that Dan has,

633
00:35:31,763 --> 00:35:35,607
but what I do have is my reputation as a good, upstanding person

634
00:35:35,639 --> 00:35:38,382
who raised a decent-enough son on her own.

635
00:35:38,472 --> 00:35:42,806
And, uh... apparently skipped the part of table manners.

636
00:35:43,730 --> 00:35:45,839
And that's what the voters will see.

637
00:35:46,844 --> 00:35:48,081
Yeah?

638
00:35:48,751 --> 00:35:50,321
But is it worth it?

639
00:35:51,150 --> 00:35:55,041
You know, if you want to change something, you have to be willing to work hard at it.

640
00:35:55,181 --> 00:35:56,266
But you do work hard.

641
00:35:56,381 --> 00:35:58,726
I mean, come on. You run two businesses.

642
00:35:58,868 --> 00:36:03,889
Well, sometimes when you're done working hard, you have to work a little harder.

643
00:36:14,813 --> 00:36:16,125
Where are you off to?

644
00:36:19,104 --> 00:36:20,558
To work a little harder.

645
00:36:24,331 --> 00:36:26,530
And now the moment everyone's been waiting for --

646
00:36:26,614 --> 00:36:29,408
the first annual Tree Hill fantasy boy draft.

647
00:36:29,495 --> 00:36:32,680
P. Sawyer, you've got the first pick, and you are on the clock.

648
00:36:32,781 --> 00:36:34,859
Who's this year's first draft pick gonna be?

649
00:36:36,068 --> 00:36:37,566
I'll pick...

650
00:36:40,159 --> 00:36:41,752
Mouth McFadden.

651
00:36:41,851 --> 00:36:43,335
Mouth goes to Peyton!

652
00:36:43,378 --> 00:36:46,005
Number one draft pick, baby! Whoo-hoo!

653
00:36:46,008 --> 00:36:47,185
Okay Mouth!

654
00:36:48,001 --> 00:36:49,854
Okay, Brooke, you're next.

655
00:36:50,469 --> 00:36:52,250
Oh, Brooke, we need to talk. Since Peyton --

656
00:36:52,333 --> 00:36:55,207
Not now, Haley. I pick Chris Keller. Ha.

657
00:36:55,296 --> 00:36:57,136
Chris Keller goes to Brooke.

658
00:36:57,870 --> 00:36:58,914
Bevin, you're next.

659
00:36:58,999 --> 00:37:01,028
- Uh, actually -- 
- There's been a trade.

660
00:37:01,117 --> 00:37:02,996
- What? 
- You said we could trade.

661
00:37:03,079 --> 00:37:04,779
So Bevin traded me her number three pick.

662
00:37:04,862 --> 00:37:06,156
And I pick Lucas.

663
00:37:06,265 --> 00:37:07,960
- Lucas Scott to Rachel! 
- But she can't --

664
00:37:08,037 --> 00:37:09,760
- I pick Nathan.
- Nathan Scott to Haley.

665
00:37:09,858 --> 00:37:10,240
Wait!

666
00:37:10,322 --> 00:37:11,767
- I get skills. 
- Skills to Bevin.

667
00:37:11,879 --> 00:37:13,179
- Wait! 
- I'll take Fede.

668
00:37:13,274 --> 00:37:14,421
- Narayan. 
- Zack.

669
00:37:14,513 --> 00:37:15,651
- Dustin. 
- Daniel.

670
00:37:15,738 --> 00:37:16,839
Debar.

671
00:37:17,817 --> 00:37:19,921
This is awesome. Everybody got who they wanted.

672
00:37:20,001 --> 00:37:21,215
Great idea, Brooke.

673
00:37:23,679 --> 00:37:24,604
Super.

674
00:37:29,519 --> 00:37:30,404
Bevin.

675
00:37:31,647 --> 00:37:35,169
What the hell was going through your size-two brain?

676
00:37:35,241 --> 00:37:37,089
You said we could trade.

677
00:37:37,994 --> 00:37:39,639
Why is she wearing my necklace?

678
00:37:39,721 --> 00:37:41,240
Because that was part of the trade.

679
00:37:41,352 --> 00:37:42,129
Okay.

680
00:37:42,234 --> 00:37:47,100
Why would you trade your third pick and my necklace

681
00:37:47,187 --> 00:37:48,999
for Rachel's fifth pick?

682
00:37:49,083 --> 00:37:49,901
Duh!

683
00:37:49,988 --> 00:37:54,054
Brooke, five... is more than three.

684
00:37:54,941 --> 00:37:55,584
Oh.

685
00:37:56,014 --> 00:37:58,093
It made total sense when Rachel explained it.

686
00:37:58,175 --> 00:37:58,851
Right.

687
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:02,232
Hey. That's my necklace.

688
00:38:02,330 --> 00:38:03,706
No, it's mine.

689
00:38:03,764 --> 00:38:05,474
And I guess it comes with the matching boyfriend.

690
00:38:05,513 --> 00:38:07,171
Oh, you're not getting Lucas.

691
00:38:07,253 --> 00:38:08,611
Oh, really?

692
00:38:09,140 --> 00:38:12,810
Anyone who's caught breaking the rules will be kicked off the squad.

693
00:38:12,906 --> 00:38:14,831
I guess I can have your captain spot, too.

694
00:38:15,594 --> 00:38:20,226
I think Brooke deserves a round of applause for orchestrating this whole event.

695
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:25,224
Anything else of yours I want, I'll let you know.

696
00:38:26,902 --> 00:38:27,857
It was great.

697
00:38:27,885 --> 00:38:29,048
Thank you so much.

698
00:38:30,422 --> 00:38:31,219
Good night.

699
00:38:32,475 --> 00:38:33,442
Peyton, um...

700
00:38:34,620 --> 00:38:36,842
I just want to say thank you for not picking Nathan.

701
00:38:36,923 --> 00:38:38,513
It wasn't me. It was you.

702
00:38:38,784 --> 00:38:41,108
It's about time you started to fight for your husband.

703
00:38:48,987 --> 00:38:54,079
Karen Roe claims to be a sweet, level-headed local business woman and mother.

704
00:38:54,256 --> 00:38:57,170
Just don't get on her bad side.

705
00:39:01,719 --> 00:39:05,277
Karen Roe -- you'd be "crazy" to vote for her.

706
00:39:05,375 --> 00:39:08,744
I'm Dan Scott, and I approve this message.

707
00:39:11,252 --> 00:39:12,862
It's time to go negative.

708
00:39:49,223 --> 00:39:50,752
Thanks for the coffee.

709
00:39:50,850 --> 00:39:52,078
Anytime.

710
00:39:53,206 --> 00:39:55,006
All right, let's move it out.

711
00:41:08,522 --> 00:41:10,910
Out of the night that covers me,

712
00:41:11,013 --> 00:41:13,744
black as the pit from pole to pole,

713
00:41:14,964 --> 00:41:17,699
I thank whatever gods may be

714
00:41:17,872 --> 00:41:20,140
for my unconquerable soul.

715
00:41:22,749 --> 00:41:25,113
In the fell clutch of circumstance,

716
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:28,662
I have not winced nor cried aloud.

717
00:41:29,617 --> 00:41:32,275
Under the bludgeonings of chance,

718
00:41:32,424 --> 00:41:34,070
my head is bloody,

719
00:41:34,193 --> 00:41:35,781
but unbowed.

720
00:41:37,934 --> 00:41:41,633
Beyond this place of wrath and tears

721
00:41:41,773 --> 00:41:44,503
looms but the horror of the shade.

722
00:41:45,477 --> 00:41:48,089
And yet the menace of the years

723
00:41:48,438 --> 00:41:51,939
finds, and shall find me, unafraid.

724
00:41:57,566 --> 00:42:00,396
It matters not how strait the gate...

725
00:42:01,573 --> 00:42:04,861
...how charged with punishments the scroll.

726
00:42:06,649 --> 00:42:09,497
I am the master of my fate.

727
00:42:10,876 --> 00:42:13,782
I am the captain of my soul.

728
00:42:13,802 --> 00:42:15,304
