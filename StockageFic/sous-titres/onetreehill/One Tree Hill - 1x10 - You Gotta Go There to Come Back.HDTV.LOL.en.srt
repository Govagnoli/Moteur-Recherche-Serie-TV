1
00:03:04,212 --> 00:03:05,246
Well you look like hell.

2
00:03:07,018 --> 00:03:08,134
I didn’t get much sleep.

3
00:03:08,564 --> 00:03:09,619
Why’s that? What’s up?

4
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:13,136
You ever have a tough decision to make,

5
00:03:13,618 --> 00:03:15,046
and you wonder if you made the right choice?

6
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,796
Well, what kind of choice are you talking about?

7
00:03:17,805 --> 00:03:18,442
Well…

8
00:03:22,526 --> 00:03:23,423
Morning Boyfriend…

9
00:03:26,696 --> 00:03:27,570
again.

10
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,121
Thank You.

11
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:33,260
I think you’re good.

12
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:38,110
Keith, Brooke. Brooke, my uncle Keith.

13
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:39,340
Hi.

14
00:03:40,057 --> 00:03:40,708
Hi.

15
00:03:42,127 --> 00:03:43,309
We gotta get out of here, alright.

16
00:03:43,411 --> 00:03:47,191
Yeah okay. Oh don’t forget your moms calling from Italy 6 pm sharp.

17
00:03:47,251 --> 00:03:48,971
Oh right, alright I’ll be here, promise.

18
00:03:49,467 --> 00:03:50,133
Okay.

19
00:03:57,158 --> 00:03:59,120
So if my parents come home,

20
00:04:00,103 --> 00:04:03,605
I’m gonna act like I have amnesia, so don’t freak out if I pretend not to know you.

21
00:04:08,551 --> 00:04:11,771
Look, I think I should get back to the madness.

22
00:04:12,973 --> 00:04:17,473
But hey, if I could, I’d stay like this all day.

23
00:04:19,667 --> 00:04:20,424
Okay.

24
00:04:25,794 --> 00:04:28,478
Nathan, about last night…

25
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:32,748
Hey, look, its not about sex with me, okay?

26
00:04:34,083 --> 00:04:36,690
When you’re ready, I’ll be too.

27
00:04:39,658 --> 00:04:40,578
Come here.

28
00:05:06,617 --> 00:05:08,669
Special Delivery for Mrs. Dan Scott.

29
00:05:10,145 --> 00:05:11,563
What are you doing here?

30
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,861
I wanted to apologize for last night.

31
00:05:14,558 --> 00:05:17,518
We were both spent. We both said things we regret.

32
00:05:17,839 --> 00:05:18,710
At least I know I did.

33
00:05:19,094 --> 00:05:20,512
- Dan…
- These are for you.

34
00:05:22,146 --> 00:05:25,935
And, I made a reservation at Chatley Resort.

35
00:05:27,563 --> 00:05:28,603
Remember the view?

36
00:05:29,924 --> 00:05:35,249
Dan… if you’re in the mood to mend fences, start by devoting a weekend to your son.

37
00:05:35,805 --> 00:05:39,047
One without your inflated expectations of him.

38
00:05:39,457 --> 00:05:43,523
If you hadn’t noticed the only quality time you’ve spent with him lately was in an emergency room.

39
00:05:44,644 --> 00:05:49,001
You figure out how to make sure that never happens again then maybe you and I can talk.

40
00:05:55,473 --> 00:05:58,847
It’s not that hard, alright? Peyton and I just don’t make sense as a couple.

41
00:05:59,373 --> 00:06:00,404
She said so herself.

42
00:06:00,515 --> 00:06:01,759
And then took it back.

43
00:06:02,974 --> 00:06:04,249
Now what are you? Her lawyer?

44
00:06:05,232 --> 00:06:09,420
I’m just… look, I’ve seen Peyton really try to make an effort to turn things around

45
00:06:09,461 --> 00:06:12,804
and it just sucks that she got bit the first time she reached out to somebody, you know?

46
00:06:13,342 --> 00:06:15,779
Haley, I’m not the bad guy here, okay?

47
00:06:16,177 --> 00:06:18,278
Peyton’s just too… hard.

48
00:06:18,713 --> 00:06:20,843
Unlike Brooke who I understand is nice and easy.

49
00:06:21,104 --> 00:06:21,852
Excuse me.

50
00:06:22,849 --> 00:06:26,627
She makes me laugh. She’s honest, she’s not afraid to be herself. Okay?

51
00:06:26,695 --> 00:06:28,349
Plus she’s not covered head to toe in issues.

52
00:06:30,192 --> 00:06:31,318
What’s so bad about that?

53
00:06:33,222 --> 00:06:36,156
Nothing! Nothing. If you’re happy, I’m happy.

54
00:06:36,582 --> 00:06:37,165
Are you?

55
00:06:38,823 --> 00:06:39,618
Happy.

56
00:06:42,332 --> 00:06:42,956
Yeah.

57
00:06:44,896 --> 00:06:45,956
I hope you’re right.

58
00:06:52,377 --> 00:06:56,325
Hey, I’ve been two-waying you all day, where have you been?

59
00:06:57,337 --> 00:06:58,254
Nowhere really.

60
00:07:00,082 --> 00:07:01,700
I wanted to talk to you about Lucas.

61
00:07:03,453 --> 00:07:04,997
You left so quick the other night.

62
00:07:06,256 --> 00:07:07,337
What was that all about?

63
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:09,498
Did he tell you what happened?

64
00:07:10,466 --> 00:07:13,410
We didn’t really do much talking after you left, if you know what I mean.

65
00:07:15,048 --> 00:07:17,158
I was just returning a CD I borrowed.

66
00:07:24,321 --> 00:07:25,238
Late night?

67
00:07:25,876 --> 00:07:26,497
Yeah.

68
00:07:27,485 --> 00:07:28,212
Who’s the girl?

69
00:07:29,127 --> 00:07:30,020
You don’t know her.

70
00:07:31,012 --> 00:07:33,387
Come on, man. We’re gonna be late for practice.

71
00:07:42,861 --> 00:07:44,412
Nice to see you vertical.

72
00:07:46,766 --> 00:07:47,705
How you feeling?

73
00:07:48,226 --> 00:07:49,245
Same as always.

74
00:07:51,139 --> 00:07:52,026
What’s this all about?

75
00:07:54,407 --> 00:08:00,483
Seems to me, we’ve lost track of what this game’s supposed to be about.

76
00:08:01,652 --> 00:08:02,957
Myself included.

77
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:06,081
I want you to take this time,

78
00:08:07,032 --> 00:08:09,316
and think about why we’re really out there.

79
00:08:10,489 --> 00:08:13,836
Till then, no practice.

80
00:08:24,041 --> 00:08:24,834
This sucks.

81
00:08:24,948 --> 00:08:28,531
Speak for yourself. Whitey just did me a favor.

82
00:08:29,427 --> 00:08:32,275
Yeah, me too.

83
00:08:43,213 --> 00:08:43,864
Peyton.

84
00:08:45,006 --> 00:08:45,658
What?

85
00:08:46,898 --> 00:08:50,205
Look, about last night, I feel really bad about what happened…

86
00:08:50,241 --> 00:08:51,781
Can we not relive it, please?

87
00:08:52,591 --> 00:08:55,985
I’d had this really weird, long day, and I just…

88
00:08:56,748 --> 00:08:59,144
- I probably wasn’t making any sense.
- No, you were.

89
00:08:59,722 --> 00:09:03,645
But I had no idea you were coming over last night, you know. And Brooke and I were just…

90
00:09:03,715 --> 00:09:04,700
Make a really good couple.

91
00:09:06,037 --> 00:09:07,295
I’m happy for you.

92
00:09:08,749 --> 00:09:12,088
You’re a good guy, Luke. And she’s my best friend.

93
00:09:15,344 --> 00:09:19,629
Business seems to have dropped off lately, and I’m beginning to take it personally.

94
00:09:19,711 --> 00:09:22,979
Oh don’t, no, it’s the University, they’re on a break. It will pick up soon.

95
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:24,175
Oh.

96
00:09:25,512 --> 00:09:31,381
You know, Karen actually always thought we should do live entertainment to bring people in, like um…

97
00:09:31,632 --> 00:09:33,239
like an open mic night.

98
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:36,511
Hmm, well that’s a great idea.

99
00:09:36,633 --> 00:09:38,051
- You think?
- Yeah absolutely.

100
00:09:38,216 --> 00:09:42,674
But  let me run it by Lucas first, you know, make sure he’s ok with the idea.

101
00:09:42,792 --> 00:09:47,539
Yeah or, I could talk to him. I mean, he hasn’t popped in much lately.

102
00:09:47,723 --> 00:09:51,948
Yeah yeah, I’ve noticed. No that’s one of the reasons I want to talk to him myself.

103
00:09:52,162 --> 00:09:53,143
Okay.

104
00:09:53,775 --> 00:09:57,948
Well, if you have this ghost town under control, then I have a study session with Nathan.

105
00:09:58,649 --> 00:10:01,798
Haley, I’m glad you’re seeing Nathan.

106
00:10:02,264 --> 00:10:03,958
He’s lucky to have someone like you.

107
00:10:05,193 --> 00:10:05,873
Thanks.

108
00:10:07,641 --> 00:10:08,204
Bye!

109
00:10:24,683 --> 00:10:26,093
What are you doing?

110
00:10:26,324 --> 00:10:27,270
D ocumenting.

111
00:10:28,059 --> 00:10:30,583
A day without Cheer. Hour one.

112
00:10:32,333 --> 00:10:34,228
There’s something wrong with this picture though.

113
00:10:34,975 --> 00:10:36,783
Oh I know what it is, I’m not in it!

114
00:10:38,142 --> 00:10:38,924
Come here.

115
00:10:45,284 --> 00:10:47,540
Would you please draw your freaky drawings later?

116
00:10:48,283 --> 00:10:51,525
There is no basketball, we’re young, we’re gorgeous,

117
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:54,612
we have all this free time so lets go do something fun.

118
00:10:55,144 --> 00:10:58,082
What about Lucas? I’m sure he’d be up for some fun.

119
00:10:58,779 --> 00:11:00,146
Probably some polaroids too.

120
00:11:01,704 --> 00:11:04,975
Lucas, the monkey in the room.

121
00:11:05,830 --> 00:11:06,567
Elephant.

122
00:11:07,298 --> 00:11:08,204
Whatever.

123
00:11:09,208 --> 00:11:11,784
Look, I came to make sure there’s no weirdness about that.

124
00:11:12,695 --> 00:11:16,755
You’re my best friend and I would never cut you out for a guy. Okay?

125
00:11:16,822 --> 00:11:20,729
No matter who he is. Or how happy he makes me.

126
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:24,037
Brooke, I’m cool with you and Lucas.

127
00:11:24,575 --> 00:11:25,249
You sure?

128
00:11:25,579 --> 00:11:29,331
Yeah, I just wanna draw for a little bit.

129
00:11:31,583 --> 00:11:32,606
How about a rain check?

130
00:11:36,012 --> 00:11:36,800
Count on it.

131
00:11:37,984 --> 00:11:38,941
Hoes over bros.

132
00:11:41,936 --> 00:11:43,349
I am gonna borrow this though.

133
00:11:43,958 --> 00:11:46,396
Incase he’s feeling frisky. Thanks!

134
00:11:57,690 --> 00:11:59,048
Tell me I heard this wrong

135
00:12:00,445 --> 00:12:02,136
It’s called knocking.

136
00:12:02,222 --> 00:12:03,845
You did not just cancel practice.

137
00:12:03,907 --> 00:12:05,693
You ever play the ponies, Danny?

138
00:12:06,226 --> 00:12:10,199
What do you think of a Whirly Bird in the third? You think that’s a win place or show?

139
00:12:10,353 --> 00:12:13,287
Have you completely lost it? You have a perfect season.

140
00:12:15,002 --> 00:12:19,788
You see that sign in the gym? It’s got my name on it.

141
00:12:20,368 --> 00:12:22,333
Means I call the shots.

142
00:12:23,203 --> 00:12:25,662
The game’s not fun anymore, Danny.

143
00:12:26,512 --> 00:12:29,569
Somewhere along the way we’ve strayed off the path.

144
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:32,530
You’re supposed to be their coach, a leader.

145
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:36,950
That is something that we agree on.

146
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:39,540
We’ve driven him too hard, Danny.

147
00:12:39,686 --> 00:12:40,823
What are you talking about?

148
00:12:41,231 --> 00:12:42,409
Dehydration.

149
00:12:44,288 --> 00:12:46,090
We both know it’s more than that.

150
00:12:46,465 --> 00:12:47,565
So now you’re a doctor.

151
00:12:48,063 --> 00:12:50,509
I’ve taken steps to ease the pressure.

152
00:12:52,516 --> 00:12:56,248
I think you’d be well advised to take a couple of days and do the same.

153
00:13:02,830 --> 00:13:04,928
Hit the lights on the way out, would you?

154
00:13:18,505 --> 00:13:19,828
Hey. How you feeling son?

155
00:13:20,543 --> 00:13:23,226
Okay. What’s my bag doing here?

156
00:13:23,324 --> 00:13:24,460
Well I packed some things for you.

157
00:13:24,988 --> 00:13:29,273
- Dad, I’m not gonna move to the beach house.
- You’re not gonna have to, we’ll work this out.

158
00:13:30,236 --> 00:13:33,144
- Well then what’s this?
- You and I are going away for the weekend.

159
00:13:33,989 --> 00:13:35,883
- Are you kidding? 
- I already cleared it with your mom.

160
00:13:35,919 --> 00:13:38,659
I’ve got your golf clubs in the back of the car, we’ve got a 9 am tee-time.

161
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:42,544
Dad, you can’t just spring things on me like this, alright? I had plans this weekend.

162
00:13:42,601 --> 00:13:44,736
I know you do, with me.

163
00:13:56,804 --> 00:14:02,082
Oh, say it isn’t so. Fergy and Skills take it 15-13.

164
00:14:07,770 --> 00:14:10,034
This guy's got his own personal cheering squad now?

165
00:14:10,199 --> 00:14:11,753
How you know she's not cheering for me?

166
00:14:12,031 --> 00:14:14,442
Trust me dawg, she's not cheering for you man.

167
00:14:14,981 --> 00:14:15,455
Hey babe.

168
00:14:15,609 --> 00:14:18,170
Hey Luke. So that means we’re gonna get to see a little bit more of you,

169
00:14:18,201 --> 00:14:20,489
I mean you know since you got some time on your hands, right?

170
00:14:20,545 --> 00:14:22,619
Not if I have anything to say about it, boys.

171
00:14:22,906 --> 00:14:24,503
See that is whack, dawg.

172
00:14:25,297 --> 00:14:27,269
We win the game and he get the girl.

173
00:14:36,766 --> 00:14:37,493
Lucas?

174
00:14:38,885 --> 00:14:39,858
Oh hey...

175
00:14:40,157 --> 00:14:44,462
I’m not playing hookie from your moms café, I just ran out of coffee filters.

176
00:14:45,419 --> 00:14:48,562
Okay. See you later.

177
00:14:49,198 --> 00:14:52,668
I’m glad we bumped into each other. Haley and I were talking

178
00:14:52,726 --> 00:14:56,759
and we thought it might be fun to start up some live entertainment at the café.

179
00:14:56,872 --> 00:14:57,400
Great.

180
00:14:58,117 --> 00:15:02,336
Are you sure? Because if you think it’s a decision your mom should be making I understand.

181
00:15:02,398 --> 00:15:06,340
No it’s… it’s a great idea. It’s good. Good.

182
00:15:06,489 --> 00:15:07,406
- Good.
- Yeah.

183
00:15:09,065 --> 00:15:12,695
- Lucas, are you alright?
- Yeah.

184
00:15:13,001 --> 00:15:18,341
Hey. Don’t you think it makes more sense to buy in bulk? Plus… for desert.

185
00:15:21,906 --> 00:15:24,711
Oh, Hi Mrs. Scott.

186
00:15:25,018 --> 00:15:25,618
Hi.

187
00:15:26,871 --> 00:15:30,466
Um… excuse me.

188
00:15:35,918 --> 00:15:38,863
Of all the things to stick in my mouth it had to be my foot.

189
00:15:40,270 --> 00:15:41,679
Lucas, come on, hold up.

190
00:15:42,836 --> 00:15:44,280
Did you see the look on her face?

191
00:15:44,986 --> 00:15:49,748
Yeah, total Judge Judy. Which is completely ridiculous considering who her son is.

192
00:15:50,982 --> 00:15:52,420
She’s friends with my mom.

193
00:15:54,212 --> 00:15:56,623
Right… forgot about that one.

194
00:15:57,769 --> 00:16:02,143
Well, your mom’s in Europe for the next month so what are the odds she remembers this?

195
00:16:02,922 --> 00:16:04,577
Whipped cream and condoms…

196
00:16:12,087 --> 00:16:13,532
Are you and mom getting a divorce?

197
00:16:14,401 --> 00:16:15,553
Why? What’d she tell you?

198
00:16:16,014 --> 00:16:19,828
She kicked you out of the house, right? That’s usually the first step.

199
00:16:20,612 --> 00:16:22,838
Don’t worry, things will be back to normal in no time.

200
00:16:23,054 --> 00:16:26,905
No,  dad. Mom doesn’t want things to be back to normal, she wants them to be better.

201
00:16:27,627 --> 00:16:30,001
Listen to me Nathan, you have a great life.

202
00:16:30,191 --> 00:16:33,017
A beautiful home and a basketball pedigree any kid would die for.

203
00:16:33,633 --> 00:16:34,635
Yeah, I know.

204
00:16:35,577 --> 00:16:36,408
I almost did.

205
00:16:38,394 --> 00:16:39,474
Hey, what are you doing?

206
00:16:39,730 --> 00:16:43,790
Oh just marveling at my lack of artistic ability. How’s the amazing race?

207
00:16:44,143 --> 00:16:46,417
Well, it’s about as well as can be expected.

208
00:16:46,678 --> 00:16:49,852
Well, I wish you were here. We’re doing this open mic thing at the café tomorrow.

209
00:16:50,041 --> 00:16:53,344
So I’m gone for 2 hours and you go all Hollywood on me.

210
00:16:53,442 --> 00:16:56,360
Yeah that’s me, Glamour girl. Hey, you want to say hi to your mom?

211
00:16:58,008 --> 00:17:00,441
No, it’s bad timing.

212
00:17:01,106 --> 00:17:03,861
Look, let me give you a call back alright? Bye.

213
00:17:06,416 --> 00:17:07,240
How’s he doing?

214
00:17:07,470 --> 00:17:11,326
Well there was no gun play or screaming so I’m assuming pretty well. He said to say “hi”.

215
00:17:12,203 --> 00:17:17,296
- Haley, these um, these flyers…
- Suck! Yeah, uh huh! I know! I know!

216
00:17:17,576 --> 00:17:21,673
I’m trying everything! Hang on!

217
00:17:24,330 --> 00:17:25,180
Hi Keith, bye Keith.

218
00:17:26,062 --> 00:17:27,095
Nice talking to you too.

219
00:17:27,607 --> 00:17:29,210
Hey, Oh I’m glad you’re here.

220
00:17:29,563 --> 00:17:31,279
Yeah I heard you could use the business.

221
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:33,978
Uh, yeah, that too.

222
00:17:35,303 --> 00:17:38,533
So let me guess, Dan did something.

223
00:17:38,647 --> 00:17:42,952
Of course, but actually this is about Lucas.

224
00:17:43,638 --> 00:17:48,021
I saw him at the grocery store today. He was with a girl.

225
00:17:48,116 --> 00:17:51,145
Oh yeah, that’s Brooke, he’s been spending a lot of time with her.

226
00:17:51,646 --> 00:17:52,951
I can’t say I blame him.

227
00:17:53,244 --> 00:17:55,692
Uh, they were, buying condoms.

228
00:17:56,669 --> 00:17:57,472
Right.

229
00:17:59,634 --> 00:18:03,602
I guess you could take comfort in the fact that he’s being safe,

230
00:18:03,648 --> 00:18:08,972
but you know mistakes happen. I’m a walking poster child for it.

231
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:10,533
Oh boy.

232
00:18:11,973 --> 00:18:14,225
Karen’s calling tonight, what am I going to tell her?

233
00:18:15,347 --> 00:18:18,025
You know besides the fact that I want what’s best for Lucas, I just...

234
00:18:18,705 --> 00:18:20,144
I don’t wanna let her down.

235
00:18:20,851 --> 00:18:26,386
Well then don’t. She’s 3000 miles away, she trust’s you to handle this.

236
00:18:26,739 --> 00:18:28,234
I could always lock him in the cellar.

237
00:18:29,002 --> 00:18:31,030
I was going to suggest talking to him.

238
00:18:31,481 --> 00:18:32,198
Or that!

239
00:18:38,005 --> 00:18:38,853
Oh, hey.

240
00:18:39,539 --> 00:18:39,959
Hey.

241
00:18:40,179 --> 00:18:42,258
I need your help. Don’t worry, it doesn’t involve orphans

242
00:18:42,299 --> 00:18:44,689
or Nathan or any major commitment of any kind.

243
00:18:45,087 --> 00:18:46,190
What does it involve?

244
00:18:46,358 --> 00:18:47,366
Your artistic ability.

245
00:18:49,551 --> 00:18:50,152
Cute.

246
00:18:50,266 --> 00:18:52,478
I know. Can you fix it?

247
00:18:52,824 --> 00:18:54,791
Yeah! I can burn them!

248
00:18:55,348 --> 00:18:57,260
Can you come up with a design that doesn’t suck?

249
00:18:57,397 --> 00:18:59,291
- When do you need them by?
- Tomorrow afternoon.

250
00:18:59,968 --> 00:19:00,685
Okay.

251
00:19:00,864 --> 00:19:02,237
Oh, thank you! You’re the best.

252
00:19:02,537 --> 00:19:04,602
I take back everything I said about you before we met.

253
00:19:08,242 --> 00:19:09,430
Welcome back, Mr. Scott.

254
00:19:09,676 --> 00:19:12,333
- Thank you.
- Your room is all ready. And your wife?

255
00:19:12,476 --> 00:19:14,258
Uh, actually there’s been a change of plans.

256
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:16,505
This is gonna be a guys weekend! This is my son Nathan.

257
00:19:16,582 --> 00:19:19,199
Oh well the suite that you requested has a King size.

258
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:20,432
Shall I check for a double room?

259
00:19:20,575 --> 00:19:21,831
I’d hate to give up the view.

260
00:19:22,815 --> 00:19:25,023
I’ll tell you what. Why don’t you bring up a cot.

261
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:25,957
Very good.

262
00:19:27,084 --> 00:19:28,656
Dad, are you kidding me?

263
00:19:29,183 --> 00:19:30,975
This was supposed to be a weekend for you and mom?

264
00:19:31,502 --> 00:19:33,197
Well, it didn’t work out that way did it?

265
00:19:33,283 --> 00:19:35,515
So this whole father son thing, this is just plan B.

266
00:19:35,582 --> 00:19:38,424
What difference does it make how or why we got here. The point is we’re here.

267
00:19:38,486 --> 00:19:39,714
And we’re gonna have a good time.

268
00:19:44,635 --> 00:19:45,340
It’s Haley.

269
00:19:45,961 --> 00:19:47,359
She’s got you on a short leash.

270
00:19:49,376 --> 00:19:50,144
Yeah.

271
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:51,460
Hey, it's Haley.

272
00:19:51,670 --> 00:19:54,532
Yeah, I know. Look, its not a good time right now, alright?

273
00:19:54,619 --> 00:19:56,338
- Oh sorry, I just…
- I’ll call you back.

274
00:19:57,236 --> 00:19:58,045
Nice work.

275
00:19:59,993 --> 00:20:02,083
Shall I send up your bags?

276
00:20:02,315 --> 00:20:06,292
I have some golf clubs in the back of the car too, I’m taking my son to school on the links tomorrow.

277
00:20:06,344 --> 00:20:07,814
They’ll be waiting on you on the tee in the morning.

278
00:20:07,891 --> 00:20:08,540
Perfect.

279
00:20:26,615 --> 00:20:27,833
Hi, Uncle Keith.

280
00:20:28,489 --> 00:20:29,139
Brooke.

281
00:20:30,322 --> 00:20:33,358
Could you maybe pick this up some other time? I’d like to have a word with Luke.

282
00:20:34,279 --> 00:20:35,047
Okay.

283
00:20:36,154 --> 00:20:38,242
- Keith.
- Say goodnight, Luke

284
00:20:39,358 --> 00:20:42,180
I’ll… call you later.

285
00:20:51,175 --> 00:20:52,655
What the hell do you think you’re doing?

286
00:20:52,793 --> 00:20:54,754
That’s funny, I was just about to ask you the same thing.

287
00:20:55,569 --> 00:20:56,296
I get it.

288
00:20:57,375 --> 00:20:58,743
This is about Deb, right?

289
00:20:58,875 --> 00:21:03,434
No. This is, um, about you. And some incredibly bad judgment.

290
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:07,508
And I think you should remember that Deb’s the one keeping your mothers business alive while she’s gone.

291
00:21:07,855 --> 00:21:11,430
Yes, but it doesn’t give her the right to butt in, alright?

292
00:21:11,927 --> 00:21:15,752
I mean, look at Nathan. The guy gets away with 10 times the crap I do.

293
00:21:15,819 --> 00:21:16,852
Well, you’re not Nathan.

294
00:21:18,456 --> 00:21:21,004
And you know, that’s not the point.

295
00:21:21,998 --> 00:21:24,896
I mean, what is this? You couldn’t even be home for your mothers phone call tonight?

296
00:21:28,188 --> 00:21:29,101
I forgot.

297
00:21:30,943 --> 00:21:31,907
What’d you tell her?

298
00:21:32,582 --> 00:21:35,013
I told her that you missed her. And that you loved her.

299
00:21:35,668 --> 00:21:37,322
And that you were at the library studying.

300
00:21:38,564 --> 00:21:45,038
You  know, the Luke Scott that I know, is better than this.

301
00:21:46,114 --> 00:21:48,351
Well look, the Keith Scott that I know isn’t my mother, alright?

302
00:21:49,398 --> 00:21:52,164
He’s not even her boyfriend. So this really isn’t your business.

303
00:21:52,755 --> 00:21:54,050
Well, that’s where you’re wrong.

304
00:21:54,664 --> 00:21:56,303
Cause while I’m here, it is my business.

305
00:21:57,725 --> 00:22:00,542
You know, you might wanna take a long hard look in the mirror.

306
00:22:00,798 --> 00:22:04,223
And see if the guy staring back at you is the kind of person you want to be.

307
00:22:22,644 --> 00:22:25,631
Well, what do you know, you actually hit the fare way this time.

308
00:22:33,755 --> 00:22:34,805
Watch and learn.

309
00:22:41,103 --> 00:22:42,469
Oh, so pretty!

310
00:22:43,009 --> 00:22:46,842
My ball cleared yours on the fly. Maybe you wanna hit from the ladies tee next time.

311
00:22:47,082 --> 00:22:47,799
Wanna drive?

312
00:22:48,584 --> 00:22:49,417
I just did!

313
00:22:51,855 --> 00:22:57,021
Vex, Cat Power, Cheap Trick. You’re all over the place!

314
00:22:57,319 --> 00:22:58,864
I kind of got a lot of moods.

315
00:23:01,003 --> 00:23:06,293
- Alright, finished.
- Oh, this is great! Thank you!

316
00:23:06,365 --> 00:23:07,154
No problem.

317
00:23:07,773 --> 00:23:10,528
Hello! Best friend! Pick up the phone.

318
00:23:11,075 --> 00:23:14,675
Don’t pretend you’re not there, cause I can see you on your cry for help web cam.

319
00:23:15,365 --> 00:23:16,608
Web Cam?

320
00:23:17,179 --> 00:23:18,551
Hi to you too tutor girl!

321
00:23:18,623 --> 00:23:21,429
Hold no just one second. Hello?

322
00:23:23,248 --> 00:23:26,021
Look, I’m busy, I promised I would do something.

323
00:23:27,121 --> 00:23:30,122
Okay. Yeah I’ll call you tonight. Bye.

324
00:23:31,638 --> 00:23:33,271
Do you need help with those?

325
00:23:33,568 --> 00:23:34,935
Oh no, you don’t have to do that.

326
00:23:34,996 --> 00:23:37,843
No, yeah I do. I mean, if you want help.

327
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:40,435
Yes, I would love help. Yeah, come on.

328
00:23:45,468 --> 00:23:45,980
Hey.

329
00:23:46,872 --> 00:23:47,567
Hey.

330
00:23:47,828 --> 00:23:50,556
I was just on my way down to the river court man, thought maybe you’d want to shoot around.

331
00:23:50,699 --> 00:23:52,994
Yeah, it kind of feels weird not having Saturday practice, right?

332
00:23:54,663 --> 00:23:55,912
Never thought I’d miss it.

333
00:23:56,261 --> 00:24:00,157
Yeah, I appreciate it, but I kind of have to stay around the house today.

334
00:24:00,530 --> 00:24:01,554
What, are you grounded?

335
00:24:02,112 --> 00:24:03,771
No, no not exactly.

336
00:24:05,016 --> 00:24:05,783
You sick?

337
00:24:10,662 --> 00:24:14,980
Alright cool, you know what? You don’t wanna hang out with me, man, its cool. Alright?

338
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:16,680
I’ll see you later, man.

339
00:24:17,261 --> 00:24:17,985
Luke.

340
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:22,469
Come on in.

341
00:24:40,328 --> 00:24:41,737
So, this is Jenny.

342
00:24:45,889 --> 00:24:46,656
Is she...

343
00:24:46,784 --> 00:24:50,112
Yeah. Yeah, she’s all mine.

344
00:24:50,742 --> 00:24:52,155
Wow, that is unbelievable.

345
00:24:53,497 --> 00:24:54,419
How old is she?

346
00:24:54,808 --> 00:24:58,321
She’s 6 months. 9 days and a couple of hours.

347
00:25:03,773 --> 00:25:04,787
Who’s the mother?

348
00:25:05,423 --> 00:25:07,736
Uh, that’s...

349
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:12,944
that's a long story but lets just say shes out of the picture.

350
00:25:16,296 --> 00:25:17,659
So you’re raising her all by yourself?

351
00:25:18,324 --> 00:25:20,075
No, my parents they work nights.

352
00:25:20,470 --> 00:25:22,948
And they help out a lot, between the three of us we’re handling it.

353
00:25:24,495 --> 00:25:26,168
That explains a lot about you, man.

354
00:25:30,099 --> 00:25:33,024
But um, why keep her a secret?

355
00:25:34,181 --> 00:25:35,732
Oh come on, you know how people are.

356
00:25:36,286 --> 00:25:41,134
Yeah, but if you treat this like its something to be ashamed of,

357
00:25:43,024 --> 00:25:45,753
your daughter will carry that around with her for the rest of her life.

358
00:25:46,018 --> 00:25:48,027
Well no, I’m not ashamed of her.

359
00:25:48,747 --> 00:25:50,207
I’m just trying to protect her.

360
00:25:51,897 --> 00:25:53,964
You know, my mom did the same thing.

361
00:25:56,146 --> 00:25:59,643
When I found out, the truth about who I was,

362
00:26:02,305 --> 00:26:04,445
there was a part of me that thought that maybe,

363
00:26:05,924 --> 00:26:09,632
she kept it a secret because she was ashamed of me.

364
00:26:11,891 --> 00:26:15,049
Trust me man, you don’t want to hide this.

365
00:26:25,996 --> 00:26:26,830
Are you gonna come?

366
00:26:28,650 --> 00:26:29,456
I don’t know.

367
00:26:31,229 --> 00:26:33,610
- I want it, it's just kind of…
- Brooke and Lucas.

368
00:26:34,228 --> 00:26:35,632
He told me about the other night.

369
00:26:37,778 --> 00:26:41,100
It’s my own fault. I blew it.

370
00:26:41,499 --> 00:26:42,119
Sorry.

371
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:47,034
The worst part is though, Brooke is my best friend,

372
00:26:47,342 --> 00:26:50,429
you know and she doesn’t have any idea how much this is killing me.

373
00:26:51,586 --> 00:26:54,534
I don’t know what kind of karmic monster I was in my past life!

374
00:26:55,216 --> 00:26:58,876
Probably one of those sirens that lure in sailors and then kill them on the rocks.

375
00:27:02,472 --> 00:27:09,358
Look, between you and me, I really don’t see Lucas and Brooke as like an epic romance, okay?

376
00:27:10,101 --> 00:27:14,615
But I mean, he did ask me to give them a chance, so I kind of owe him that, you know?

377
00:27:16,465 --> 00:27:17,689
Well, what do you think I should do?

378
00:27:18,937 --> 00:27:19,694
The same thing.

379
00:27:24,503 --> 00:27:27,965
Never up never in Nathan. You really fell apart on the back nine.

380
00:27:28,735 --> 00:27:30,508
I think you told me that a few times already, Dad.

381
00:27:35,434 --> 00:27:37,007
Well, it was a nice try.

382
00:27:37,968 --> 00:27:40,171
Well, you sink this one you might actually break 100.

383
00:27:41,048 --> 00:27:47,395
Alright focus. Square your shoulders. Loose grip. Line it up. Good.

384
00:27:48,870 --> 00:27:50,123
Wow, what the hell are you doing?!

385
00:27:50,344 --> 00:27:51,752
Never up never in, right dad?

386
00:27:52,438 --> 00:27:54,359
- Hey! Watch it!
- You know, this whole thing

387
00:27:54,435 --> 00:27:58,029
is just another chance for you to pick me apart and show me how much better you are.

388
00:27:58,259 --> 00:28:01,245
Well there you go Dad, you just kicked my ass, congratulations.

389
00:28:01,521 --> 00:28:02,620
It was great, really.

390
00:28:03,713 --> 00:28:04,618
Don’t make a scene.

391
00:28:04,777 --> 00:28:07,936
You know what? I almost killed myself for you. You know that?

392
00:28:08,156 --> 00:28:08,898
What are you talking about?

393
00:28:09,216 --> 00:28:10,896
Drugs dad! I took drugs for you.

394
00:28:11,101 --> 00:28:14,070
No! My son would never take drugs.

395
00:28:14,219 --> 00:28:14,936
“Your son”.

396
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:17,997
It’s all about you, isn’t it, dad?

397
00:28:18,550 --> 00:28:21,053
You know why mom kicked you out? Cause you’re a bully.

398
00:28:21,172 --> 00:28:23,449
And you don’t give a damn about anything other than your own ego.

399
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:24,510
Would you keep your voice down?

400
00:28:24,566 --> 00:28:26,860
No! You know what you should do? You should give mom a divorce.

401
00:28:26,916 --> 00:28:29,451
You should do her a favor and give mom a divorce.

402
00:28:29,905 --> 00:28:32,886
She’s never going to be happy with you, dad. Nobody is!

403
00:28:44,970 --> 00:28:48,005
You always were a sorry paper boy.

404
00:28:49,087 --> 00:28:51,886
Whenever you did manage to drag your butt out of bed,

405
00:28:52,523 --> 00:28:56,955
I’d get the paper either through a broken window or on a working sprinkler head.

406
00:28:57,056 --> 00:29:00,822
Well maybe if you tipped in Holidays, it would be a different story.

407
00:29:01,723 --> 00:29:02,911
Pure extortion.

408
00:29:05,339 --> 00:29:09,671
Well, are you here to warn me about the town lynching?

409
00:29:10,352 --> 00:29:13,003
No firm date has been set yet, far as I know.

410
00:29:15,112 --> 00:29:16,444
Taking a little hiatus, huh?

411
00:29:16,991 --> 00:29:20,155
Extreme times call for extreme measures.

412
00:29:21,227 --> 00:29:25,000
Oh yeah, that’s kind of why I’m here.

413
00:29:25,813 --> 00:29:27,038
I need some advice.

414
00:29:27,856 --> 00:29:29,172
More trouble with Nathan?

415
00:29:30,079 --> 00:29:31,051
Nah, its Lucas.

416
00:29:32,069 --> 00:29:35,776
I’m worried he’s taken some wrong turns and I think I might be part of the problem.

417
00:29:36,289 --> 00:29:37,134
How’s that?

418
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:42,755
Well, I’m not exactly a shinning example of good choices.

419
00:29:44,004 --> 00:29:49,211
Well, you could take a page out of my book and step back.

420
00:29:49,755 --> 00:29:52,233
That’s your advice? Just… do nothing?

421
00:29:52,397 --> 00:29:57,799
Or you could emulate your brother and smother the kid with your own short comings.

422
00:30:00,701 --> 00:30:02,959
Now I’ve coached 35 teams.

423
00:30:03,298 --> 00:30:04,844
Some of them I’ve coddled,

424
00:30:05,392 --> 00:30:06,882
some of them I’ve yelled at.

425
00:30:08,048 --> 00:30:11,048
But each player has to find his own game.

426
00:30:14,772 --> 00:30:17,878
Don’t worry about Lucas. He’s a good kid.

427
00:30:19,364 --> 00:30:21,817
He’ll find his way back to the main road.

428
00:30:30,551 --> 00:30:31,820
- Hey.
- Hi.

429
00:30:34,902 --> 00:30:36,198
You’re Gavin DeGraw.

430
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:38,094
Oh yeah, that’s me.

431
00:30:38,273 --> 00:30:39,711
Are you playing in town?

432
00:30:39,875 --> 00:30:42,824
Yeah, we’re doing a gig at Carolina, and an interview.

433
00:30:42,973 --> 00:30:46,126
Oh, wow... Okay, not to be presumptuous or anything

434
00:30:46,183 --> 00:30:50,540
but you wouldn’t be interested in playing a smaller space, like a much much smaller space.

435
00:30:50,592 --> 00:30:53,187
There’s a thing across the street tonight. Open mic night.

436
00:30:53,234 --> 00:30:55,823
I know that’s way beneath you but I would score so many major cool points

437
00:30:55,905 --> 00:30:59,362
if you would just come and play a couple of songs. I’ll stop now!

438
00:30:59,855 --> 00:31:04,609
- Well, what’s the name of this place?
- Um, Karen’s Café?

439
00:31:04,655 --> 00:31:07,344
- It’s low key though right?
- No, totally low key.

440
00:31:08,193 --> 00:31:10,288
Um, maybe I’ll see you there.

441
00:31:10,898 --> 00:31:12,956
- Yeah maybe.
- Okay... Bye

442
00:31:13,525 --> 00:31:14,144
Bye.

443
00:31:19,655 --> 00:31:20,294
Hey.

444
00:31:21,890 --> 00:31:22,474
Hey.

445
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:34,403
I kind of said some brutal things last night I wish I could take back.

446
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:36,268
Well, obviously I suck at this.

447
00:31:37,015 --> 00:31:43,456
I... I want to be your friend, but I also want to do the right thing by your mom.

448
00:31:43,856 --> 00:31:46,241
And I know how important that is to you.

449
00:31:47,525 --> 00:31:49,220
I’m not really making it easy, am I?

450
00:31:49,431 --> 00:31:53,239
Well, at a certain point its up to you. It’s your life.

451
00:31:53,388 --> 00:31:57,690
And I think the best thing I can do is back off and let you live it.

452
00:31:58,441 --> 00:32:01,708
And if you need help, I’ll always be there.

453
00:32:04,984 --> 00:32:05,609
Thanks.

454
00:32:30,135 --> 00:32:30,940
Hey.

455
00:32:31,158 --> 00:32:33,432
I guess all those flyers weren’t a complete waste of trees.

456
00:32:33,571 --> 00:32:35,316
Thank you so much for your help.

457
00:32:36,141 --> 00:32:37,502
Oh, just grab an apron.

458
00:32:38,343 --> 00:32:41,778
Kidding! Sit wherever you want, order whatever you want on the house,

459
00:32:41,855 --> 00:32:42,566
I’m glad you came.

460
00:32:49,627 --> 00:32:51,711
So this is the place.

461
00:32:52,991 --> 00:32:53,984
This is it.

462
00:32:54,751 --> 00:32:56,042
Very buzz worthy.

463
00:33:00,803 --> 00:33:02,616
Cool clientele too.

464
00:33:12,184 --> 00:33:13,429
Listen, Deb, um…

465
00:33:14,009 --> 00:33:15,739
I just wanted to say you’re doing a great job.

466
00:33:16,497 --> 00:33:17,690
My mom will be happy.

467
00:33:18,984 --> 00:33:21,617
That means a lot to me, thanks Lucas.

468
00:33:21,888 --> 00:33:23,731
And, about the other night...

469
00:33:23,865 --> 00:33:26,942
Yeah, yeah I know you think I overstepped my bounds.

470
00:33:27,249 --> 00:33:30,946
No, its just that if you have a problem with me,

471
00:33:32,058 --> 00:33:33,829
could you just talk to me about it first?

472
00:33:35,759 --> 00:33:37,372
- You got it.
- Alright.

473
00:33:44,881 --> 00:33:48,051
Hey, mind if I join you?

474
00:33:52,408 --> 00:33:56,321
Actually, I was just leaving, I’ll see you two.

475
00:34:01,666 --> 00:34:02,583
I’ll be right back.

476
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:08,896
Peyton!

477
00:34:13,391 --> 00:34:15,158
What’s going on? Are you mad at me?

478
00:34:15,686 --> 00:34:17,523
Its not you, Brooke, its me.

479
00:34:17,928 --> 00:34:22,065
I thought I was cool with this but I’m not, I’m sorry.

480
00:34:22,254 --> 00:34:23,196
With me and Lucas?!

481
00:34:24,368 --> 00:34:26,842
You do not have to feel like a third wheel.

482
00:34:27,256 --> 00:34:31,357
You’re my best friend. Okay? He gets that.

483
00:34:31,482 --> 00:34:32,848
It’s not that, Brooke.

484
00:34:33,026 --> 00:34:34,184
Then what is it?

485
00:34:35,191 --> 00:34:36,013
I just…

486
00:34:40,476 --> 00:34:45,402
You’re right, it’s the whole third wheel thing, I guess I just missed you.

487
00:34:46,554 --> 00:34:48,914
Then will you please come inside and hang out?

488
00:34:51,133 --> 00:34:53,502
I miss you too, okay?

489
00:34:55,340 --> 00:34:56,290
Come on.

490
00:35:09,221 --> 00:35:12,451
Hey, so I just want to remind everybody that the stage is open,

491
00:35:12,513 --> 00:35:15,380
if anybody has any hidden talent they want to reveal.

492
00:35:15,929 --> 00:35:16,886
I’ll give it a shot.

493
00:35:19,508 --> 00:35:23,342
Great, come on up. Thank God.

494
00:35:25,004 --> 00:35:27,079
Jake Jagielski, ladies and gentlemen.

495
00:35:34,432 --> 00:35:37,919
Um, so normally, I only sing for my daughter.

496
00:35:39,244 --> 00:35:45,937
But something that a friend said convinced me that I should open up to a wider audience

497
00:35:46,863 --> 00:35:48,655
and this seemed like the right time and place.

498
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:52,240
So everyone, this is my daughter, Jenny.

499
00:35:53,155 --> 00:35:58,307
And Jenny, this is my whole world.

500
00:35:59,371 --> 00:36:00,651
Jake has a baby?

501
00:36:06,857 --> 00:36:07,579
You okay?

502
00:36:10,379 --> 00:36:13,115
- Yeah.
- Such a Lonely boy

503
00:36:13,219 --> 00:36:15,804
Couldn’t find the joy within

504
00:36:20,737 --> 00:36:22,826
Such a lonely girl

505
00:36:23,082 --> 00:36:27,291
Such a lonely world we’re living in

506
00:36:30,896 --> 00:36:34,239
I watch it all go by

507
00:36:35,842 --> 00:36:41,985
I can’t find a tear to cry

508
00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:48,072
Jerk never called you back, did he?

509
00:36:50,167 --> 00:36:52,527
Believe me, you didn’t want to talk to him anyways.

510
00:36:53,321 --> 00:36:54,580
What are you doing here?

511
00:36:54,785 --> 00:36:58,954
- Look I’m sorry…
- No… I’m glad you’re back.

512
00:36:59,618 --> 00:37:01,303
Yeah me too!

513
00:37:02,292 --> 00:37:08,554
It’s like, every time I’m with him, I just get caught in this rip tide, you know,

514
00:37:09,111 --> 00:37:12,383
the harder I try to get out, the harder it is for me to keep from downing.

515
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:15,020
Maybe you just need to steer clear of the water for a little while.

516
00:37:16,972 --> 00:37:21,277
Hey, Nate. I thought you weren’t getting back till tomorrow, what happened?

517
00:37:21,871 --> 00:37:24,708
We were keeping score mom. What do you think happened?

518
00:37:24,753 --> 00:37:27,698
Oh honey I’m sorry, I should have known.

519
00:37:27,827 --> 00:37:30,188
Whatever, I’m used to it.

520
00:37:37,523 --> 00:37:40,375
Such a lonely boy

521
00:37:42,552 --> 00:37:45,357
Such a lonely girl

522
00:37:47,667 --> 00:37:52,243
It’s such a lonely world

523
00:38:03,276 --> 00:38:05,432
So what are you, like, married too?!

524
00:38:05,489 --> 00:38:07,901
Nah, its just me and Jenny.

525
00:38:10,846 --> 00:38:13,999
- She’s got your eyebrows
- Oh, that’s not a good thing!

526
00:38:14,598 --> 00:38:15,873
She’s beautiful.

527
00:38:17,143 --> 00:38:18,725
Thanks, Peyton.

528
00:38:29,203 --> 00:38:30,122
Thanks for coming

529
00:38:30,818 --> 00:38:32,683
I thought this was going to be low key.

530
00:38:33,066 --> 00:38:35,067
Sorry! Is it still cool?

531
00:38:35,176 --> 00:38:35,826
Yeah, its alright.

532
00:38:39,123 --> 00:38:42,640
Listen man, some of the guys and I are gonna go down to the River Court,

533
00:38:43,689 --> 00:38:45,201
I wanted to know if you and the team wanted to come.

534
00:38:46,337 --> 00:38:47,018
Why?

535
00:38:48,769 --> 00:38:49,717
Cause it’s fun.

536
00:38:51,684 --> 00:38:52,697
Don’t you remember?

537
00:39:05,015 --> 00:39:07,699
Alright Ladies and gentlemen, give it up for Gavin DeGraw!

538
00:39:12,061 --> 00:39:17,864
I don't need to be anything other than a prison guard's son

539
00:39:18,230 --> 00:39:23,807
I don't need to be anything other than a specialist's son

540
00:39:24,482 --> 00:39:30,360
I don't have to be anyone other than a birth of two souls in one

541
00:39:30,728 --> 00:39:36,355
Part of where I'm going is knowing where I'm coming from

542
00:39:36,448 --> 00:39:42,517
I don't want to be anything other than what I've been trying to be lately

543
00:39:42,613 --> 00:39:48,009
All I have to do is think of me and I have peace of mind

544
00:39:48,736 --> 00:39:52,510
I'm tired of looking 'round rooms wondering what I gotta do

545
00:39:52,592 --> 00:39:54,947
Or who I'm supposed to be

546
00:39:55,064 --> 00:39:59,826
I don't want to be anything other than me

547
00:40:02,477 --> 00:40:05,863
Good evening everyone to a historic game of basketball.

548
00:40:05,903 --> 00:40:09,253
I’m Mouth McFadden and tonight this is the only game that matters.

549
00:40:23,476 --> 00:40:24,167
Hey.

550
00:40:24,716 --> 00:40:25,888
Hey, tutor girl!

551
00:40:45,093 --> 00:40:47,264
I guess this answers the gay question.

552
00:40:49,395 --> 00:40:50,264
Give me this.

553
00:40:52,117 --> 00:40:53,007
Get in.

554
00:40:56,136 --> 00:40:57,089
Cheese!

555
00:41:06,519 --> 00:41:08,286
I thought you might want to see this, coach.

556
00:41:10,574 --> 00:41:13,053
Come a long way since the last time we sat here.

557
00:41:14,018 --> 00:41:19,745
Uh huh. Makes you wonder where they’re all headed.

558
00:41:36,252 --> 00:41:37,009
Busy night?

559
00:41:38,858 --> 00:41:40,077
What happened today, Dan?

560
00:41:41,070 --> 00:41:44,449
Oh you know, we were going to spend the weekend but we missed you too much.

561
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:48,248
I ask you to make good with your son and you make it worse.

562
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:52,101
He flipped out on the 18th hole. It was embarrassing.

563
00:41:52,498 --> 00:41:54,685
And did you badger him into it?

564
00:41:59,202 --> 00:42:01,329
You have a problem, Dan.

565
00:42:01,510 --> 00:42:04,524
You’re competitive and controlling and you need some help.

566
00:42:04,628 --> 00:42:06,588
Since when did you become mother of the year?

567
00:42:07,582 --> 00:42:10,257
Last I knew you were out of sight half the month and out of mind the rest.

568
00:42:11,156 --> 00:42:14,832
You’re right. I have a lot of catching up to do with Nathan.

569
00:42:15,330 --> 00:42:18,616
But at least I’m trying to help. You on the other hand…

570
00:42:18,816 --> 00:42:19,769
What about me?

571
00:42:21,155 --> 00:42:22,464
I want you to see someone.

572
00:42:23,152 --> 00:42:25,645
A therapist. We’ll go as a family.

573
00:42:26,055 --> 00:42:26,803
Forget it.

574
00:42:27,425 --> 00:42:29,809
It's not a negotiation, Dan.

575
00:42:30,208 --> 00:42:32,690
You get some help or you’re not going to see Nathan.

576
00:42:37,155 --> 00:42:39,777
You really think you’re going to stop me from seeing my own son?

577
00:42:41,355 --> 00:42:42,577
Try me.

578
00:42:46,428 --> 00:42:52,024
