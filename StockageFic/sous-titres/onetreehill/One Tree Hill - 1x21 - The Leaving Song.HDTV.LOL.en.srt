1
00:02:22,184 --> 00:02:23,053
Get dressed.

2
00:02:23,974 --> 00:02:27,266
Dude, it’s six am, what are you doing?

3
00:02:27,384 --> 00:02:28,096
We’re going running.

4
00:02:28,849 --> 00:02:30,400
No, I’m going to bed.

5
00:02:30,527 --> 00:02:31,568
I’ll just keep knocking.

6
00:02:32,643 --> 00:02:35,156
Playoff’s are next week. Got to get you ready, man.

7
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:39,181
Workouts, studying game tapes, whatever it takes.

8
00:02:40,517 --> 00:02:41,240
Why?

9
00:02:42,119 --> 00:02:43,077
Cause I want to win.

10
00:02:43,809 --> 00:02:44,660
And I need your help.

11
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:48,830
Besides, you stood up to my dad the other day.

12
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:50,080
I owe you.

13
00:02:57,130 --> 00:02:58,090
So listen.

14
00:02:59,497 --> 00:03:01,090
There’s something that’s been bothering me.

15
00:03:02,983 --> 00:03:07,315
That thing Dan said, about asking my mom what kind of parent he was.

16
00:03:09,083 --> 00:03:10,223
Any idea what he meant?

17
00:03:10,787 --> 00:03:13,762
Probably just more of his mind games, man. That’s the way he is.

18
00:03:16,563 --> 00:03:17,361
You descent?

19
00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:18,528
Clothing wise.

20
00:03:20,156 --> 00:03:21,734
Hey, you’re back online.

21
00:03:23,782 --> 00:03:27,407
Oh, damn, I got dressed in front of that web cam.

22
00:03:28,042 --> 00:03:29,138
Don’t tell me that.

23
00:03:29,839 --> 00:03:31,728
I thought you said that thing was evil, anyway.

24
00:03:32,046 --> 00:03:35,198
Yeah, well that was before I saw you pulling your duffel bag out of the closet.

25
00:03:35,444 --> 00:03:36,997
Were you going to tell me that you’re leaving?

26
00:03:37,212 --> 00:03:38,958
I’m just going down to the keys.

27
00:03:39,526 --> 00:03:41,900
Boat leaves Saturday morning, I’ll be back in six days.

28
00:03:41,999 --> 00:03:43,950
Okay. Five nights to party.

29
00:03:44,058 --> 00:03:47,390
And no time to talk, so, here comes.

30
00:03:48,767 --> 00:03:52,347
Are you comfortable with me seeing Lucas’ mom?

31
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:56,984
- If it’s too weird for you...
- No, it’s not that. I like Karen.

32
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:00,021
Something going on with you and Lucas?

33
00:04:00,523 --> 00:04:02,826
Not really. It’s cool.

34
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:07,262
What if it was too weird for me? You dating Karen.

35
00:04:08,101 --> 00:04:10,891
You’d just have to get used to it.

36
00:04:15,178 --> 00:04:16,135
You do your thing.

37
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:21,206
Shut that thing off.

38
00:04:27,927 --> 00:04:32,140
Hey, mom. The other night I saw Dan, and he said something.

39
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:33,522
What now?

40
00:04:34,143 --> 00:04:37,587
He said to ask you what really happened back then.

41
00:04:39,394 --> 00:04:42,399
- Any idea what he meant?
- Who knows. It’s Dan.

42
00:04:42,677 --> 00:04:48,314
Yeah, but, I don’t know. He was talking about what kind of father he was.

43
00:04:50,769 --> 00:04:52,297
Was he just messing with me?

44
00:04:55,940 --> 00:05:00,564
Lucas, you know that I always have your best interest in mind. Since day one.

45
00:05:00,647 --> 00:05:03,269
- You believe that, right?
- Yeah.

46
00:05:04,237 --> 00:05:05,292
Well, um,

47
00:05:07,804 --> 00:05:11,794
after you were born, Dan asked to be in your life.

48
00:05:14,477 --> 00:05:18,015
You told me he never showed up.

49
00:05:18,813 --> 00:05:22,106
- That he didn’t want anything to do with us.
- He didn’t show up at first.

50
00:05:22,219 --> 00:05:26,508
But when he moved back to town with Deb he told me that he’d like to help raise you.

51
00:05:27,426 --> 00:05:29,810
And he asked for joint custody. I said no.

52
00:05:31,536 --> 00:05:34,292
- Why?
- I didn’t trust him.

53
00:05:35,203 --> 00:05:38,930
And Dan was ready to sue until his lawyer told him since he had left me

54
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:41,577
and gotten another girl pregnant his chances weren’t good.

55
00:05:41,829 --> 00:05:45,142
You know what Dan is like. I had to make a decision.

56
00:05:45,186 --> 00:05:46,861
I had to do what was best for you.

57
00:05:47,434 --> 00:05:52,518
And I knew that someday we’d be having this conversation but that was a risk I had to take.

58
00:05:55,054 --> 00:05:56,180
I’ve got to go to school.

59
00:05:57,885 --> 00:05:58,560
Lucas.

60
00:06:04,054 --> 00:06:05,140
Hey, Peyton!

61
00:06:06,276 --> 00:06:07,284
Come on, can I talk to you?

62
00:06:07,841 --> 00:06:12,032
That depends. Are you telling lies or things that aren’t true?

63
00:06:12,159 --> 00:06:14,084
Okay, I deserve that, but about the other night.

64
00:06:14,162 --> 00:06:16,490
Whatever, Luke. Explain it to your friend Nikki.

65
00:06:24,969 --> 00:06:32,419
So, now that Lucas has out-slutted the both of us, are we back to hoes over bros?

66
00:06:32,608 --> 00:06:36,699
Okay, she’s talking to me, does that mean she’s shopping with me?

67
00:06:37,329 --> 00:06:41,216
I was thinking, maybe we could spend a little trial make up time at the mall.

68
00:06:41,405 --> 00:06:43,156
You know there may be hope for you yet.

69
00:06:44,375 --> 00:06:47,006
Gather around here, come on. Let’s move.

70
00:06:49,745 --> 00:06:50,851
Alright listen up.

71
00:06:51,768 --> 00:06:55,791
Next week you boys are going to be winning your first playoff game.

72
00:06:55,934 --> 00:06:59,324
I however am going to be flat on my back in the hospital.

73
00:07:00,236 --> 00:07:01,334
What’s going on, Coach?

74
00:07:01,450 --> 00:07:06,632
Just a little eye surgery. I’ve got a paranoid doc who says I can’t put it off any longer.

75
00:07:07,245 --> 00:07:12,448
And since it’s important to me to actually see you guys win states,

76
00:07:12,646 --> 00:07:15,278
- I’ve got to miss the first game.
- Who’s going to coach us?

77
00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:17,682
Coach McCallum most likely.

78
00:07:18,275 --> 00:07:23,525
And if you use this as an excuse to slack off I can promise you there’ll be hell to pay.

79
00:07:23,621 --> 00:07:24,706
Now hit the showers.

80
00:07:26,563 --> 00:07:27,630
You need anything, Coach?

81
00:07:28,203 --> 00:07:29,964
Yeah, my youth back.

82
00:07:33,328 --> 00:07:34,470
So, is McCallum any good?

83
00:07:34,798 --> 00:07:37,823
No, JV sucks. This one’s going to be up to you and me.

84
00:07:44,141 --> 00:07:44,781
Keith.

85
00:07:45,995 --> 00:07:49,466
Hey. Just ordered some pizza. You interested?

86
00:07:49,594 --> 00:07:50,266
Sure.

87
00:07:51,725 --> 00:07:54,601
Hey listen, I wanted to ask you something about Dan.

88
00:07:55,559 --> 00:07:57,234
About how he wanted to share custody.

89
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,443
Oh, is he spreading that lie again?

90
00:08:00,628 --> 00:08:03,127
Keith, mom told me it was true.

91
00:08:03,193 --> 00:08:04,586
What do you mean? How he called her from college?

92
00:08:04,683 --> 00:08:05,846
No, after that.

93
00:08:07,391 --> 00:08:09,851
Dan wanted joint custody, I thought you knew that.

94
00:08:10,034 --> 00:08:12,568
No, I didn’t know that.

95
00:08:14,016 --> 00:08:17,698
Do you think things would have been different? If mom would have given him a chance?

96
00:08:17,765 --> 00:08:19,419
You mean like the chance he had with Nathan?

97
00:08:19,921 --> 00:08:22,019
Yeah but what was he like back then, anyway?

98
00:08:22,403 --> 00:08:23,478
What are you thinking?

99
00:08:23,582 --> 00:08:28,744
I mean, it’s easy to see a guy that never cared.

100
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,895
I  mean it’s easier to hate him that way. Right?

101
00:08:32,674 --> 00:08:34,928
Well maybe that’s why your mom kept it from you.

102
00:08:35,999 --> 00:08:39,786
Yeah, I know he’s a bad guy,

103
00:08:40,263 --> 00:08:44,763
but maybe he’s just made some poor choices, and it got out of control.

104
00:08:46,544 --> 00:08:49,366
- I mean I’ve been doing that myself.
- Luke, you’re not Dan.

105
00:08:51,896 --> 00:08:54,025
The man’s whole life is poor choices.

106
00:08:54,301 --> 00:08:58,438
Yeah, but that’s just it. Maybe this is the one that changed him.

107
00:09:07,258 --> 00:09:10,900
You are totally saving my life. Thank you. I’ve got to get a cable modem.

108
00:09:11,188 --> 00:09:13,512
It’s cool. I’ve got to run to practice, anyway.

109
00:09:14,572 --> 00:09:18,600
Then I’m going to pick up an extra shift at the mall, try to pay for this cable modem.

110
00:09:18,971 --> 00:09:20,987
And  after that, I’m working out with Lucas.

111
00:09:21,054 --> 00:09:23,368
Well who are you and what have you done with my real boyfriend?

112
00:09:24,290 --> 00:09:26,363
Well, you said you wanted me to cut the guy some slack.

113
00:09:26,661 --> 00:09:28,779
You sure it’s not also cause it’s a way to stick it to Dan?

114
00:09:28,857 --> 00:09:30,557
- No, that’s not what it is.
- Okay.

115
00:09:31,248 --> 00:09:34,223
I’m going to stick it to my dad by erasing him from the record books, alright?

116
00:09:34,443 --> 00:09:36,485
- Good.
- I’ve got to go.

117
00:09:37,553 --> 00:09:38,696
I’ll see you.

118
00:09:42,875 --> 00:09:44,233
English class, here I come.

119
00:09:50,622 --> 00:09:51,714
Dan Scott.

120
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:55,998
They haven’t even cut me open yet and you’ve already smelled the blood.

121
00:09:56,525 --> 00:09:58,790
What’s this I hear about you not coaching the playoffs?

122
00:09:59,014 --> 00:10:02,188
- First game of the playoffs.
- And the last if they lose.

123
00:10:03,090 --> 00:10:05,450
The teams ready. McCallum will do fine.

124
00:10:05,973 --> 00:10:10,241
McCallum, you’ve got to be kidding me. JV’s won what, five games all season?

125
00:10:10,570 --> 00:10:14,307
Well, actually 4. That other one was a forfeit.

126
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:17,020
Exactly my point. Better let me do it.

127
00:10:19,008 --> 00:10:21,440
I’m old, Danny, but I’m not senile.

128
00:10:21,609 --> 00:10:23,826
Come on, Whitey, you know I know this team as well as you do.

129
00:10:23,928 --> 00:10:28,962
- Every game, every player.
- You ought to. You daddied a half of them.

130
00:10:29,539 --> 00:10:35,287
Okay. Look, I know you don’t care much for me, but you do care a lot about this team.

131
00:10:35,341 --> 00:10:38,004
I care enough about them to protect them from you.

132
00:10:38,893 --> 00:10:41,926
- Over my dead body, Danny.
- Well if that’s the way you want it.

133
00:10:43,456 --> 00:10:45,075
Oh, by the way...

134
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:50,158
I’m going to be just fine, thanks for asking.

135
00:10:57,342 --> 00:10:58,464
My legs are dead.

136
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:02,037
Come on, one more game, man, see what you’ve got.

137
00:11:11,821 --> 00:11:12,790
Nice shot, Haley.

138
00:11:21,267 --> 00:11:23,310
So did Dan talk about me when you were little?

139
00:11:27,325 --> 00:11:30,367
Well, when I was younger I used to hear my parents argue about you.

140
00:11:31,272 --> 00:11:35,164
I knew you were out there. And I hated the fact so I hated you.

141
00:11:37,131 --> 00:11:39,091
I just thought what my dad wanted me to think.

142
00:11:40,381 --> 00:11:42,762
It sounds stupid but it made sense at the time.

143
00:11:44,928 --> 00:11:48,805
You know he wanted joint custody of me. That’s what he was talking about at the jail.

144
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:52,370
Wow. I didn’t see that coming.

145
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:57,480
The one descent thing the guy does and he buries it, huh?

146
00:11:57,550 --> 00:12:01,950
So you think if Dan would have gotten his way, you and I might have grown up together?

147
00:12:02,156 --> 00:12:03,342
What would that have gotten us?

148
00:12:04,563 --> 00:12:06,294
Well we could have teamed up against him.

149
00:12:06,708 --> 00:12:08,188
Or we could have killed each other.

150
00:12:09,412 --> 00:12:11,608
Trust me, man, you didn’t miss out on anything.

151
00:12:13,764 --> 00:12:17,200
Until the latter part of his life, Darwin was a naturalist

152
00:12:17,308 --> 00:12:21,827
and the author of the book “The Origin of Species” which was published in…

153
00:12:55,033 --> 00:12:56,367
Keith, hey.

154
00:12:56,675 --> 00:12:58,216
Lucas came to see me last night.

155
00:13:00,884 --> 00:13:02,759
He had a lot of questions about what you told him.

156
00:13:03,623 --> 00:13:04,423
About Dan.

157
00:13:05,708 --> 00:13:06,879
And he wasn’t the only one.

158
00:13:07,341 --> 00:13:10,663
- You have a right to be upset.
- You’re damn straight I have a right to be upset!

159
00:13:11,303 --> 00:13:14,868
You want to explain to me how you could keep that from me all these years?

160
00:13:16,181 --> 00:13:17,997
I had a right to know Dan wanted custody.

161
00:13:18,072 --> 00:13:19,643
What would you have done differently?

162
00:13:20,539 --> 00:13:23,033
- Would you have loved Lucas any less?
- Of course not.

163
00:13:23,693 --> 00:13:25,567
But I might have had a different opinion of my brother.

164
00:13:25,672 --> 00:13:30,781
Oh come on, Keith. Your opinion of Dan is based on more than just his behavior towards Lucas.

165
00:13:31,502 --> 00:13:35,828
Back then, he told me that he approached you about joint custody, okay?

166
00:13:36,524 --> 00:13:40,179
And I called him a liar. And now I find out the person lying was you.

167
00:13:40,237 --> 00:13:43,620
I was trying to protect Lucas! I was trying to give him the best life possible.

168
00:13:44,496 --> 00:13:48,238
I was a kid, Keith. And I was scared.

169
00:13:49,033 --> 00:13:53,375
I was scared I was going to lose you too. You and Dan are brothers there was always that chance.

170
00:13:54,199 --> 00:13:56,196
What, that I’d take his side over yours?

171
00:13:57,006 --> 00:13:57,927
Well yeah.

172
00:14:00,072 --> 00:14:03,322
God, Karen, I thought you knew me better than that.

173
00:14:19,205 --> 00:14:20,941
I was just leaving you a note to call me.

174
00:14:21,171 --> 00:14:23,997
I thought you had to invite vampires in.

175
00:14:25,402 --> 00:14:27,219
I’m all talked out with you.

176
00:14:27,315 --> 00:14:31,120
That may well be but I’m still going to need your playbooks, stats, team rosters,

177
00:14:31,262 --> 00:14:33,019
but don’t you worry, I’ve got my own whistle.

178
00:14:33,315 --> 00:14:34,724
What the hell are you talking about?

179
00:14:35,364 --> 00:14:37,683
Looks like I’ll be coaching that playoff game after all.

180
00:14:37,770 --> 00:14:40,863
The hell you will, I told you my decision was final.

181
00:14:40,951 --> 00:14:43,905
So was the athletic committees. And I believe they trump you.

182
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:49,264
We had a little session this afternoon. You really should get yourself a cell phone Whitey.

183
00:14:53,593 --> 00:14:56,449
Just what I was looking for. Don’t you worry Whitey.

184
00:14:57,345 --> 00:14:58,543
The teams in good hands.

185
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,750
So I hope you don’t mind I had to bring Jenny along. Jake kind of asked last minute.

186
00:15:06,832 --> 00:15:11,147
Well it’s never to early to learn to accessorize, right? Want to go look at cds?

187
00:15:11,262 --> 00:15:14,758
Why? So I can listen to you complain as I check out all the new releases?

188
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:19,273
Well we could go try on lingerie and you can listen to me whine about how fat I am.

189
00:15:19,381 --> 00:15:22,724
- You’re not fat.
- I know, I just like to hear it.

190
00:15:23,738 --> 00:15:25,904
You know, I’ve really missed this whole girlfriend thing.

191
00:15:26,611 --> 00:15:27,927
Of course you have.

192
00:15:28,613 --> 00:15:31,853
Well, well, well. As a babysitter, apparently you suck.

193
00:15:32,227 --> 00:15:34,578
- Nikki, what are you doing?
- Protecting my baby.

194
00:15:34,685 --> 00:15:38,587
While you two barbies were getting ready to make out, anybody could have taken her.

195
00:15:38,679 --> 00:15:39,626
Put her down.

196
00:15:39,794 --> 00:15:41,874
Right, I take orders from you.

197
00:15:42,990 --> 00:15:45,273
- Where are you going?!
- Shopping with my daughter.

198
00:15:45,366 --> 00:15:48,510
- I don’t think so.
- Yeah, I see you stopping me.

199
00:15:49,918 --> 00:15:52,097
- Nikki!
- Go get security, okay?

200
00:15:55,507 --> 00:15:57,905
Nikki.  Nikki!

201
00:15:58,061 --> 00:15:59,206
Where is my phone?

202
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:02,293
Damn it! Where is my phone?

203
00:16:03,205 --> 00:16:04,203
Nikki!

204
00:16:11,377 --> 00:16:13,169
- Hi, can I use this?
- Sure.

205
00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:14,008
Thank you.

206
00:16:18,138 --> 00:16:20,402
Karen, hey, it’s Peyton, is Jake there?

207
00:16:21,878 --> 00:16:23,597
No, he can’t call me back, I’m...

208
00:16:24,499 --> 00:16:25,630
Well where is he?

209
00:16:31,858 --> 00:16:36,309
- Peyton. Where is she?
- I lost her in the crowd. This isn’t happening.

210
00:16:36,377 --> 00:16:40,366
Police are on their way, miss, security’s been notified. If she’s still here we’ll find her.

211
00:16:40,443 --> 00:16:42,541
What if she’s already gone? What are we going to do?

212
00:16:43,258 --> 00:16:44,206
It’s okay, come here.

213
00:16:50,564 --> 00:16:51,363
Hey, Hales.

214
00:16:52,382 --> 00:16:56,749
Check it out, an entire afternoon together and no one threw a punch.

215
00:16:57,625 --> 00:16:58,367
You okay?

216
00:16:58,541 --> 00:17:00,272
Can I talk to Nathan alone please?

217
00:17:01,644 --> 00:17:04,187
Yeah sure. Catch you guys later.

218
00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:06,918
What’s up?

219
00:17:10,210 --> 00:17:16,421
I was just doing some research on the internet and I found what my boyfriend’s been studying.

220
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:22,697
This is, I just stumbled upon this, so, it’s no big deal.

221
00:17:25,329 --> 00:17:28,857
What about the half a dozen other sites that you stumbled upon and book marked?

222
00:17:29,579 --> 00:17:33,256
It’s hard enough for me that I have to compete with the girls at school that just give it away,

223
00:17:33,305 --> 00:17:36,840
- now I’ve got to be a porn star?
- Haley, look, you’re over reacting.

224
00:17:36,931 --> 00:17:39,901
No, I really don’t think that I am. This hurts me, Nathan.

225
00:17:39,988 --> 00:17:43,188
Why? Haley these girls aren’t real.

226
00:17:43,265 --> 00:17:46,721
And plus, I’m a guy. Guys look at this stuff.

227
00:17:46,787 --> 00:17:49,169
Well don’t be a guy, Nathan, be a man.

228
00:17:50,965 --> 00:17:53,029
You know, I’m not a prude, and I think you know that.

229
00:17:53,270 --> 00:17:57,423
But the thought that this is what I’m going to be compared to?

230
00:17:57,514 --> 00:17:58,774
So that’s what this is?

231
00:17:59,182 --> 00:18:00,980
You’re worried I’m going to compare you to them when we-

232
00:18:01,036 --> 00:18:03,929
Yes! I’m afraid, that’s part of it.

233
00:18:04,872 --> 00:18:08,547
Nathan it’s hard enough for me to even think about being naked in front of you.

234
00:18:08,718 --> 00:18:11,804
And the thought that this is the standard I’m going to be held to?

235
00:18:13,724 --> 00:18:14,604
Forget it.

236
00:18:15,409 --> 00:18:16,304
Haley.

237
00:18:22,255 --> 00:18:23,908
Peyton. Have they found her?

238
00:18:24,143 --> 00:18:27,083
Not yet. God, Jake, I am so, so sorry, okay?

239
00:18:27,149 --> 00:18:28,798
We only looked away for like two seconds.

240
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,139
You cannot do that!

241
00:18:30,247 --> 00:18:32,674
You just need to calm down, sir, we have officers combing the mall.

242
00:18:32,752 --> 00:18:34,434
Oh, calm down, take it easy? What do you think...

243
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:35,254
Hey.

244
00:18:37,835 --> 00:18:40,026
- What’s going on?
- What the hell are you doing, Nikki?

245
00:18:40,257 --> 00:18:42,735
I took Jenny shopping then we rode on the carousel.

246
00:18:43,932 --> 00:18:44,982
What? What’s the big deal?

247
00:18:45,059 --> 00:18:46,529
You stole her out of her stroller!

248
00:18:46,831 --> 00:18:49,842
No I didn’t. I picked her up because you two weren’t watching her

249
00:18:49,944 --> 00:18:54,147
and then I told you I was taking her shopping. Besides she’s my daughter, not yours.

250
00:18:54,321 --> 00:18:56,380
- Is that true?
- Well, yes, but...

251
00:18:56,436 --> 00:18:57,586
Which one of you has custody?

252
00:18:57,685 --> 00:18:59,626
Okay, look, she took off as soon as the baby was born.

253
00:18:59,692 --> 00:19:03,348
As long as this isn’t a custody matter I’d advice you kids to keep your family stuff at home okay?

254
00:19:04,009 --> 00:19:05,202
You can call off the dogs.

255
00:19:06,405 --> 00:19:08,433
You are unbelievable, you know that?

256
00:19:08,678 --> 00:19:12,143
- Hey, if you’d let me see her once and a while.
- That’s not going to happen, not after this.

257
00:19:12,206 --> 00:19:13,562
You think I’m such a bad mother?

258
00:19:13,772 --> 00:19:16,401
You’ve made some pretty bad decisions when it concerns Jenny.

259
00:19:17,146 --> 00:19:18,492
I’m not sure I can trust you with her.

260
00:19:18,564 --> 00:19:20,403
- Nikki.
- I’m going to get custody, Jake.

261
00:19:21,181 --> 00:19:27,417
She’s better off with me. I’ll see you soon, bunny! Yes!

262
00:19:36,539 --> 00:19:37,284
Jake...

263
00:19:47,805 --> 00:19:49,228
Haven’t worn out your welcome yet?

264
00:19:49,659 --> 00:19:52,418
No, in fact Karen made me her partner.

265
00:19:52,661 --> 00:19:54,338
I hope you mean in the business.

266
00:19:55,778 --> 00:19:57,866
- You said you had something for me.
- Yeah.

267
00:20:01,150 --> 00:20:03,754
You left this on the bedroom floor the other night.

268
00:20:06,259 --> 00:20:08,447
What makes you think I didn’t leave it there as payment?

269
00:20:10,321 --> 00:20:11,297
Excuse me, Deb.

270
00:20:13,038 --> 00:20:14,287
Dan, may I have a word with you?

271
00:20:21,895 --> 00:20:25,654
Is it just sport? This need to agitate Lucas any chance you get.

272
00:20:26,093 --> 00:20:28,817
Why on earth would you tell him that you wanted custody?

273
00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:31,424
I’m not the devil, Karen. I’m tired of being blamed for everything.

274
00:20:31,525 --> 00:20:33,850
Not everything. Just your due.

275
00:20:34,203 --> 00:20:38,976
You suggest to me that I abort my child and then one day you grow this tiny sliver of conscience

276
00:20:39,067 --> 00:20:42,077
that has long since disappeared and you expect a medal for that?

277
00:20:42,143 --> 00:20:44,678
No, I expect you to be held as accountable as I have to be.

278
00:20:44,787 --> 00:20:46,398
You’re the one who kept the truth from him.

279
00:20:47,419 --> 00:20:49,455
This is not about accountability.

280
00:20:49,952 --> 00:20:53,259
You don’t regret missing out on Lucas’ life, you hate the fact that I beat you.

281
00:20:53,383 --> 00:20:55,677
And you’re punishing him because some lawyer told you years ago

282
00:20:55,728 --> 00:20:58,918
that you could never win this one and that is pathetic, Dan!

283
00:20:59,419 --> 00:21:02,031
So do me a favor, just stay away from him.

284
00:21:02,446 --> 00:21:03,659
I can’t do that.

285
00:21:04,478 --> 00:21:05,727
I’m his coach.

286
00:21:06,275 --> 00:21:07,530
What are you talking about?

287
00:21:07,723 --> 00:21:09,828
Whitey’s off in surgery, I volunteered to step in and help.

288
00:21:10,977 --> 00:21:13,028
You just can’t let this one go, can you?

289
00:21:13,138 --> 00:21:14,892
Well it beats lying about it.

290
00:21:15,932 --> 00:21:17,202
Listen to me, Dan.

291
00:21:18,072 --> 00:21:20,351
If you use this coaching job to hurt my son,

292
00:21:20,658 --> 00:21:24,242
I don’t care who on that school board you sold cars to, I will bury you.

293
00:21:24,364 --> 00:21:27,627
You shouldn’t baby the kid, Karen. The boy needs to learn to fight his own battles.

294
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:30,095
Is that why Nathan left you?

295
00:21:44,882 --> 00:21:47,631
Peyton. Hello!?

296
00:21:47,944 --> 00:21:50,816
Oh, hey. Sorry I didn’t hear you.

297
00:21:51,170 --> 00:21:53,028
It’s okay. You alright?

298
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:58,239
Not really. I screwed up pretty bad with Jenny yesterday.

299
00:21:58,408 --> 00:22:00,380
Sorry. Is she okay?

300
00:22:00,594 --> 00:22:05,975
Yeah,  yeah she’s fine. It just potentially could have been so bad.

301
00:22:06,498 --> 00:22:07,748
I’m an idiot.

302
00:22:09,248 --> 00:22:10,604
- What’s going on?
- Oh, nothing,

303
00:22:10,686 --> 00:22:13,820
I was going to dump my problems on you but you’ve got enough to worry about.

304
00:22:13,876 --> 00:22:15,962
No, it’s cool. What’s up?

305
00:22:17,352 --> 00:22:24,813
Okay, um, I was over at Nathan’s and I was on his computer,

306
00:22:25,412 --> 00:22:28,080
and I came across all this creepy porn.

307
00:22:28,638 --> 00:22:31,428
How creepy? Like she-male midgets?

308
00:22:31,677 --> 00:22:35,693
No, like, Pamela Anderson wannabes.

309
00:22:35,868 --> 00:22:39,895
And, I’m right to be bothered by this, right?

310
00:22:39,968 --> 00:22:43,117
I mean you would be bothered by this if you guys were still together.

311
00:22:44,017 --> 00:22:47,992
Well, not really. But our relationship was nothing like yours.

312
00:22:48,062 --> 00:22:49,537
- Because you were having sex.
- No!

313
00:22:50,167 --> 00:22:53,019
Because I was never in love with Nathan the way you are.

314
00:22:56,071 --> 00:22:58,851
You know, he says he’s totally cool with waiting until I’m ready,

315
00:22:58,958 --> 00:23:03,530
but if he’s filling up with cyber-sex in the mean time, I’m not going to measure up to that.

316
00:23:03,735 --> 00:23:06,888
Haley. But you don’t have to compete with anything.

317
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,234
You’ve got something they don’t.

318
00:23:10,588 --> 00:23:12,204
You’ve got his heart, too.

319
00:23:19,791 --> 00:23:22,915
I heard it only took my dad 15 minutes to BS the athletic committee.

320
00:23:23,709 --> 00:23:24,968
We’re so screwed, man.

321
00:23:25,962 --> 00:23:27,328
Only if we let him get to us.

322
00:23:32,449 --> 00:23:36,521
So, you going to tell me what happened with Haley?

323
00:23:37,832 --> 00:23:39,861
I called her last night and she wouldn’t pick up.

324
00:23:40,253 --> 00:23:43,507
Let’s just say she found out I was looking at some websites

325
00:23:43,604 --> 00:23:45,901
that don’t exactly make me boyfriend of the year.

326
00:23:47,282 --> 00:23:49,689
Alright, not that it’s any of your business, but...

327
00:23:52,001 --> 00:23:56,154
Haley and I, we’re not, I mean she’s not, you know,

328
00:23:56,226 --> 00:24:00,013
so, I’m just trying not to pressure her, that’s all.

329
00:24:01,899 --> 00:24:03,041
Yeah, sure.

330
00:24:07,130 --> 00:24:10,301
- Porn freak. 
- What? Shut up, dude.

331
00:24:10,814 --> 00:24:13,460
Just stay away from the sites with farm animals, alright?

332
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:14,644
Oh man.

333
00:24:16,923 --> 00:24:18,426
What are you talking about?

334
00:24:27,533 --> 00:24:30,170
Most fathers would be touched by that scene.

335
00:24:31,409 --> 00:24:33,887
But I’m guessing it’s our worst nightmare.

336
00:24:34,836 --> 00:24:35,607
Coach.

337
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,189
Luke, can I talk to you?

338
00:24:55,361 --> 00:25:00,363
I owe you an apology. I shouldn’t have lied to you about Dan.

339
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:03,004
No you shouldn’t have.

340
00:25:03,989 --> 00:25:06,277
And I understand if you’re upset.

341
00:25:06,712 --> 00:25:08,073
I don’t think you do.

342
00:25:09,738 --> 00:25:11,234
I just can’t turn it off.

343
00:25:15,287 --> 00:25:19,979
All these years I was sure I should hate him, because he didn’t want me.

344
00:25:21,734 --> 00:25:23,618
I guess I’m mad at you,

345
00:25:24,678 --> 00:25:26,598
for making me question that now.

346
00:25:27,412 --> 00:25:28,805
I’m not sure I should hate him.

347
00:25:31,241 --> 00:25:32,947
I’m not even sure I know him.

348
00:25:33,321 --> 00:25:34,298
Do you want to?

349
00:25:34,647 --> 00:25:35,998
You loved him once, mom.

350
00:25:38,651 --> 00:25:40,151
Was there ever something there?

351
00:25:40,784 --> 00:25:42,286
Was he ever a good person?

352
00:25:43,197 --> 00:25:47,006
Once upon a time. He was.

353
00:25:47,345 --> 00:25:50,294
But he hasn’t been that person for a long time.

354
00:25:58,848 --> 00:25:59,986
Hold your position.

355
00:26:02,286 --> 00:26:03,493
Where’s Jagielski?

356
00:26:04,712 --> 00:26:07,051
Sometimes coach lets him miss practice because of his baby.

357
00:26:07,134 --> 00:26:11,583
Sounds like Whitey. There’ll be no more special treatment for anyone, understood?

358
00:26:12,037 --> 00:26:14,154
Now this ball control offense Whitey’s running is out.

359
00:26:14,661 --> 00:26:18,361
From now on it’s run and gun. Players make plays.

360
00:26:18,674 --> 00:26:20,712
But we’re undefeated and we’re going to playoffs.

361
00:26:20,783 --> 00:26:22,981
By the way, you’re benched. Anyone else?

362
00:26:25,258 --> 00:26:26,052
Good.

363
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:31,854
Is this bad for your shoulder?

364
00:26:32,889 --> 00:26:33,511
Probably.

365
00:26:34,791 --> 00:26:35,826
Alright, free throws.

366
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:41,264
Make ten in a row, miss one, grab a weight plate and run and start over. Let’s go.

367
00:26:45,176 --> 00:26:46,143
Bend your knees, Nathan.

368
00:26:46,583 --> 00:26:49,860
- I just made it, didn’t I?
- Hey. Whitey let you mouth off like that?

369
00:26:50,518 --> 00:26:51,288
Bend your knees.

370
00:26:57,253 --> 00:26:59,050
Grab a weight plate. Next.

371
00:27:08,664 --> 00:27:11,103
Go join your new pal. Next.

372
00:27:15,419 --> 00:27:16,878
Sprints, not runs!

373
00:27:23,493 --> 00:27:24,943
Lucas, keep moving!

374
00:27:25,752 --> 00:27:27,079
Let’s go, let’s go.

375
00:27:30,216 --> 00:27:32,961
- I’m still a little weak from the accident.
- You’re a little weak all right.

376
00:27:34,254 --> 00:27:36,904
- Oh, dad!
- Coach.

377
00:27:37,180 --> 00:27:38,695
Now get a mop, clean that up.

378
00:27:39,673 --> 00:27:41,747
Let’s go, quit slacking, let’s go.

379
00:27:46,069 --> 00:27:49,212
- What happened to you?
- First practice with Dan.

380
00:27:49,770 --> 00:27:51,921
- That brutal, huh?
- Uh huh.

381
00:27:53,651 --> 00:27:56,277
Especially for Nathan. Poor guy.

382
00:27:56,944 --> 00:27:59,631
- You’re concerned about Nathan?
- Well yeah.

383
00:28:00,779 --> 00:28:04,311
I saw first hand today how horrible it is with him and Dan.

384
00:28:04,893 --> 00:28:06,360
He needs you, Hales.

385
00:28:08,673 --> 00:28:12,273
Maybe you should cut him a break on this whole internet thing.

386
00:28:14,201 --> 00:28:18,387
- He told you about that?
- Yeah. I know, it’s weird, right?

387
00:28:18,878 --> 00:28:23,712
But we’re talking more now, and, at least he’s not cheating on you.

388
00:28:23,947 --> 00:28:28,140
- Ha! He’s looking at plastic bimbos.
- Hey, it could be worse.

389
00:28:31,017 --> 00:28:35,523
Did you ever think that maybe all this is just helping him so he can give you space,

390
00:28:35,590 --> 00:28:38,790
- so he doesn’t have to hassle you about sex?
- He shouldn’t need help giving me space,

391
00:28:38,856 --> 00:28:41,156
he should be better than that. Especially if he loves me.

392
00:28:41,223 --> 00:28:45,441
And I cannot believe that you’re defending him, whose protecting my heart in this, Luke?

393
00:28:45,497 --> 00:28:48,702
Okay, okay, I didn’t say it was okay. Alright?

394
00:28:49,664 --> 00:28:52,297
I’m just saying, after what I saw in the gym today,

395
00:28:53,761 --> 00:28:56,480
man, the guy just needs a little support.

396
00:29:12,416 --> 00:29:16,832
Jake, I feel so horrible, you have every right to be mad at me.

397
00:29:16,929 --> 00:29:18,992
I’m mad at Nikki, okay? You I’m just...

398
00:29:20,328 --> 00:29:21,793
I’m just disappointed in.

399
00:29:22,525 --> 00:29:25,731
- It was two seconds.
- A lot happened in those two seconds.

400
00:29:27,134 --> 00:29:30,529
I just got off the phone with the legal aid attorney and she said that Jenny’s fair game

401
00:29:30,631 --> 00:29:34,722
and if it goes to court, that the judge usually decides with the birth mother.

402
00:29:34,820 --> 00:29:37,343
Even if you can prove what a horrible person she is?

403
00:29:38,418 --> 00:29:39,405
You saw how she played that cop in the mall. 

404
00:29:39,518 --> 00:29:41,905
She’s going to do the same thing to a judge in court.

405
00:29:42,601 --> 00:29:43,984
What if she wins, Peyton?

406
00:29:44,715 --> 00:29:47,121
I mean, I could lose Jenny.

407
00:29:48,552 --> 00:29:50,081
I’m so sorry.

408
00:29:52,831 --> 00:29:54,941
- I’ve got to get out of here.
- Where would you go?

409
00:29:55,422 --> 00:29:59,370
- I have a cousin in Savannah. Maybe?
- Won’t that just make things worse?

410
00:30:01,371 --> 00:30:06,579
If Nikki comes after Jenny, this lawyer said it could end up costing me a fortune to fight her.

411
00:30:06,666 --> 00:30:08,965
And my parents, they’re already struggling as it is.

412
00:30:09,409 --> 00:30:12,232
This would wipe them out, I can’t do that to them.

413
00:30:13,321 --> 00:30:16,116
The only thing that I know for sure is that if I stay here,

414
00:30:17,812 --> 00:30:19,040
I’m screwed.

415
00:30:23,804 --> 00:30:27,028
Where did I put that picture of Darwin?

416
00:30:54,004 --> 00:30:57,583
You, um, said they weren’t real people.

417
00:30:58,680 --> 00:30:59,694
Haley, what are you doing?

418
00:31:00,088 --> 00:31:07,182
I’m a real person. I have feelings, I have problems, I feel vulnerable, and self-conscious and...

419
00:31:09,482 --> 00:31:12,499
- I’m just like every other person.
- I know that.

420
00:31:12,576 --> 00:31:16,431
Well what happened to sex just being magical,

421
00:31:16,524 --> 00:31:20,516
and being this amazing expression of how much you love someone?

422
00:31:21,998 --> 00:31:27,420
These cyber girls, they’re just like triple jointed and waxed,

423
00:31:27,558 --> 00:31:33,338
and always turned on, and it’s just a lie.

424
00:31:33,543 --> 00:31:36,107
I understand that. It’s just a fantasy.

425
00:31:40,982 --> 00:31:42,544
Is Peyton a fantasy, too?

426
00:31:51,804 --> 00:31:55,118
You know, it’d be nice if a guy could have a little privacy in his own apartment.

427
00:31:57,074 --> 00:31:59,076
I can’t be Peyton for you.

428
00:31:59,528 --> 00:32:02,967
I can’t be those girls. I just, I won’t.

429
00:32:03,054 --> 00:32:05,911
- I don’t want you to be.
- Are you sure about that? Because...

430
00:32:16,766 --> 00:32:18,215
I gave you my heart.

431
00:32:20,452 --> 00:32:22,244
That’s all that I can give to you.

432
00:32:24,671 --> 00:32:28,624
And if that’s not enough for you, then I’m not enough for you.

433
00:32:41,285 --> 00:32:44,527
So can I ask you a question? Were you serious about getting out?

434
00:32:45,879 --> 00:32:46,544
Yeah.

435
00:32:48,033 --> 00:32:49,150
I’m sure going to miss you.

436
00:32:52,475 --> 00:32:55,361
I’ve got a way for you to leave but you’ve got to go in the morning.

437
00:32:58,131 --> 00:33:01,187
Whoa, whoa, slow down.

438
00:33:01,929 --> 00:33:02,897
What are you talking about?

439
00:33:03,518 --> 00:33:05,289
My dad’s transport is leaving for the keys.

440
00:33:06,047 --> 00:33:07,654
Did you ask your cousin about staying with him?

441
00:33:07,838 --> 00:33:08,970
Yeah, but he’s in Savannah.

442
00:33:09,191 --> 00:33:11,925
Well my dad docks near there and a couple of other places on the way.

443
00:33:12,958 --> 00:33:16,169
Look, if you take your car Nikki can follow you, but this way-

444
00:33:18,853 --> 00:33:20,618
I don’t want you to go, Jake.

445
00:33:21,416 --> 00:33:23,382
But if you think it’s the best thing for Jenny...

446
00:33:24,935 --> 00:33:27,576
I was thinking about how crushed my parents would be if I left.

447
00:33:28,851 --> 00:33:29,839
But Nikki...

448
00:33:31,661 --> 00:33:34,596
I mean she’s been so bad to my world, already. And not just to me

449
00:33:34,657 --> 00:33:36,927
but to you and to Lucas and Brooke.

450
00:33:38,136 --> 00:33:40,013
If I stay, she’ll win custody, Peyton.

451
00:33:42,488 --> 00:33:43,337
I can’t have that.

452
00:33:44,119 --> 00:33:45,501
The boat leaves in the morning.

453
00:33:46,336 --> 00:33:47,780
And your dad’s cool with this?

454
00:33:48,519 --> 00:33:50,166
I’ll just tell him you’re visiting relatives.

455
00:33:51,154 --> 00:33:53,817
He’s a father too, Jake, he’d do anything for his daughter.

456
00:33:54,666 --> 00:33:56,443
- Just like you.
- What do you think, Jenny?

457
00:33:58,696 --> 00:34:00,805
I’ll be there in the morning either way.

458
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:10,257
Package for Deborah Scott?

459
00:34:10,836 --> 00:34:11,486
I’m Deb.

460
00:34:15,217 --> 00:34:15,786
Thanks.

461
00:34:28,132 --> 00:34:28,970
Is it bad news?

462
00:34:30,727 --> 00:34:32,067
Our divorce papers.

463
00:34:33,615 --> 00:34:36,907
Once they’re signed and filed it will all be over.

464
00:34:38,423 --> 00:34:40,403
That’s what you wanted, isn’t it?

465
00:34:41,986 --> 00:34:45,400
Yeah, I’m just surprised.

466
00:34:47,148 --> 00:34:48,996
I never expected to feel sad.

467
00:35:47,852 --> 00:35:48,859
Hey.

468
00:35:50,708 --> 00:35:52,679
I was kind of hoping you wouldn’t show.

469
00:35:54,164 --> 00:35:56,934
Jenny you be good, okay? Take care of your dad.

470
00:35:58,490 --> 00:36:00,308
- Peyton.
- Look, don’t say anything.

471
00:36:01,419 --> 00:36:02,552
You guys just be safe.

472
00:36:44,914 --> 00:36:45,667
Hey.

473
00:36:47,923 --> 00:36:48,591
You okay?

474
00:36:49,389 --> 00:36:50,771
I’ve got some stuff going on.

475
00:36:51,406 --> 00:36:52,071
I know.

476
00:36:55,282 --> 00:36:58,447
Look I just wanted to apologize, again,

477
00:36:59,931 --> 00:37:01,871
for not being a better person lately.

478
00:37:04,058 --> 00:37:05,266
I’m trying, Peyton.

479
00:37:09,838 --> 00:37:11,175
I don’t know what else to say.

480
00:37:11,815 --> 00:37:15,436
It’s not about what you say, Luke. It’s about what you do.

481
00:37:15,496 --> 00:37:17,958
You don’t like the person you’ve become? Then do something about it,

482
00:37:18,030 --> 00:37:20,283
- cause no one’s going to do it for you.
- I know.

483
00:37:22,470 --> 00:37:23,735
That’s why I came by.

484
00:37:26,504 --> 00:37:28,189
I’m going to be making a few changes.

485
00:37:30,376 --> 00:37:32,597
And I just wanted to see you before I do.

486
00:37:37,892 --> 00:37:39,048
I’ll be seeing you, Peyton.

487
00:37:52,898 --> 00:37:53,435
Hi.

488
00:37:54,061 --> 00:37:54,536
Hi.

489
00:37:57,033 --> 00:37:58,024
I didn’t want this.

490
00:38:00,194 --> 00:38:01,044
What’s that?

491
00:38:01,919 --> 00:38:03,988
This. You’re moving away.

492
00:38:05,943 --> 00:38:07,147
You’re upset with me.

493
00:38:08,005 --> 00:38:12,241
Well neither of us wanted it, but somehow here we are.

494
00:38:12,626 --> 00:38:13,762
Did I trap you?

495
00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:17,459
Did I lead you on and trick you into loving Lucas?

496
00:38:18,159 --> 00:38:20,552
No and you didn’t trick me into loving you either.

497
00:38:22,462 --> 00:38:23,717
But that’s what happened.

498
00:38:25,268 --> 00:38:29,629
And the fact that I lied about Dan’s intentions, does that change all that?

499
00:38:30,497 --> 00:38:32,620
- It colors it differently, yeah.
- How?

500
00:38:34,063 --> 00:38:37,044
Because no matter what I said back then, Dan would have been

501
00:38:37,127 --> 00:38:39,372
the same reprehensible person he’s become.

502
00:38:40,643 --> 00:38:43,268
And you still would have been there for Lucas and me.

503
00:38:43,376 --> 00:38:48,681
And what for? So I could end up pushing 40’s still living in a bachelor apartment?

504
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:51,486
Don’t you see, Karen?

505
00:38:53,123 --> 00:38:56,157
You got what you needed and so did Lucas.

506
00:38:57,130 --> 00:38:58,338
But what about me?

507
00:38:59,506 --> 00:39:00,677
I never said this before.

508
00:39:02,234 --> 00:39:03,355
But I will now.

509
00:39:04,988 --> 00:39:08,230
I stood by you, and I stood by Lucas,

510
00:39:09,914 --> 00:39:11,962
and I’m glad I did that. But...

511
00:39:13,696 --> 00:39:15,582
I just can’t help but think,

512
00:39:17,286 --> 00:39:20,942
why? What do I get out of it?

513
00:39:22,801 --> 00:39:24,900
You get a boy who loves you.

514
00:39:31,511 --> 00:39:35,386
- I’m sorry to interrupt but we need to talk.
- Okay, what’s up?

515
00:39:35,474 --> 00:39:38,729
Look, I know you did your best, mom.

516
00:39:42,006 --> 00:39:46,640
If you hadn’t kept Dan away, Keith and I probably wouldn’t have been so close.

517
00:39:49,596 --> 00:39:51,365
And I would have hated to miss that.

518
00:39:54,930 --> 00:39:58,753
So I understand now why you had to keep that secret to yourself.

519
00:40:00,086 --> 00:40:04,136
You just needed to find yourself on your own, right?

520
00:40:04,541 --> 00:40:05,261
Yes.

521
00:40:07,828 --> 00:40:09,281
Well that’s what I want, too.

522
00:40:11,862 --> 00:40:12,741
To start over.

523
00:40:15,204 --> 00:40:17,165
I mean, that’s what you did when you shut Dan out.

524
00:40:18,389 --> 00:40:20,320
That’s what you’re doing by leaving town.

525
00:40:21,073 --> 00:40:22,255
What do you mean, start over?

526
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:24,088
I mean get away.

527
00:40:25,235 --> 00:40:28,777
Away from Dan. Away from this place.

528
00:40:30,815 --> 00:40:33,002
And away from all the mistakes I’ve been making.

529
00:40:40,244 --> 00:40:43,357
I want to go with Keith, mom.

530
00:40:49,202 --> 00:40:51,481
I want to leave Tree Hill.

531
00:40:58,111 --> 00:41:05,468
