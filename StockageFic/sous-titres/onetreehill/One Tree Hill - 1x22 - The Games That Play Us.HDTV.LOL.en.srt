1
00:01:30,470 --> 00:01:33,992
Some people believe that raven’s guide travelers to their destinations.

2
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:39,220
Others believe that the sight of a solitary raven is considered good luck.

3
00:01:40,025 --> 00:01:43,132
While a group of ravens predicts trouble ahead.

4
00:01:43,977 --> 00:01:46,762
And a raven right before battle promises victory.

5
00:01:47,063 --> 00:01:50,350
Good evening ladies and gentlemen and welcome Tree Hill Raven’s basketball,

6
00:01:50,452 --> 00:01:52,856
brought to you by web cast at Ravenshoops.com.

7
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:57,366
I’m Mouth McFadden and the playoffs are finally here, so throw out the perfect record,

8
00:01:57,596 --> 00:02:00,018
if the raven’s lose this one, the season is over.

9
00:02:00,924 --> 00:02:05,389
Tonight’s obstacle is Masonboro. If you win, you’re one step closer to a state championship,

10
00:02:05,645 --> 00:02:08,312
and undefeated season and greatness.

11
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:12,240
Lose, and be losers.

12
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:32,460
You know, all this working out doesn’t mean anything if you can’t hit the shot.

13
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,130
What’s wrong with you?

14
00:02:34,241 --> 00:02:37,336
I’m just saying, it’s a waste of my time to get you ready for this game

15
00:02:37,412 --> 00:02:38,592
if you can’t score when we need it.

16
00:02:39,283 --> 00:02:40,999
Huh. Give me the ball.

17
00:02:44,825 --> 00:02:47,717
Now, you going to tell me what’s really wrong?

18
00:02:49,835 --> 00:02:50,615
I guess...

19
00:02:52,994 --> 00:02:54,531
I guess I’m just dealing with Haley.

20
00:02:55,469 --> 00:02:56,835
She’s still not talking to you, huh?

21
00:02:57,234 --> 00:02:57,911
No.

22
00:03:04,655 --> 00:03:06,589
Don’t think I haven’t noticed your part in all this.

23
00:03:09,349 --> 00:03:12,524
You know, Haley, if you’re going to manipulate him, you should aim a little higher.

24
00:03:13,865 --> 00:03:15,489
And remember, pay back is hell.

25
00:03:20,727 --> 00:03:23,772
Oh...by the way, nice tattoo.

26
00:03:24,423 --> 00:03:25,227
Real classy.

27
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:29,809
Just moments away from the beginning of this playoff game.

28
00:03:29,947 --> 00:03:33,013
Winners advance. To the losers, well, their season is over.

29
00:03:33,515 --> 00:03:36,819
Dan Scott is standing in for coach Whitey Durham who is out with an illness.

30
00:03:37,134 --> 00:03:41,011
Not sure who signed off on that one, but let’s hope Coach Durham gets well soon.

31
00:03:52,418 --> 00:03:56,223
Really, Deb, tears. On the eve of our divorce.

32
00:03:56,633 --> 00:04:00,247
No, actually, I was sitting here having second thoughts.

33
00:04:01,747 --> 00:04:05,954
Until I considered what a hideous monster you’ve been for most of our married lives.

34
00:04:10,871 --> 00:04:14,373
Well since we’re frolicking down memory lane, let’s take a stroll back to the campus

35
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:15,889
the night you told me you were pregnant.

36
00:04:18,188 --> 00:04:20,589
You know I came to you that night to tell you I had made a decision.

37
00:04:21,317 --> 00:04:23,559
I was leaving school at the end of the semester.

38
00:04:23,676 --> 00:04:25,588
Because of your fictional knee injury.

39
00:04:25,842 --> 00:04:28,699
No. No, Deb, that’s just what I told you.

40
00:04:29,852 --> 00:04:32,688
I was leaving because there was a girl I left behind.

41
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:35,017
A girl who was carrying my child.

42
00:04:35,575 --> 00:04:37,516
And a girl that I loved very much.

43
00:04:39,647 --> 00:04:40,485
Karen.

44
00:04:45,319 --> 00:04:48,283
But when I told you I was leaving you told me you were pregnant.

45
00:04:49,164 --> 00:04:51,421
I didn’t know you were leaving for Karen.

46
00:04:51,801 --> 00:04:55,067
I know. All you knew is that I would do right by you and Nathan.

47
00:04:55,867 --> 00:04:58,077
Which is something I’ve tried to do every day since then.

48
00:05:01,691 --> 00:05:03,182
And if that makes me a monster,

49
00:05:04,618 --> 00:05:05,732
then so be it.

50
00:05:09,485 --> 00:05:10,362
You alright?

51
00:05:11,088 --> 00:05:11,917
Have you seen Haley?

52
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:12,936
No.

53
00:05:20,227 --> 00:05:22,669
Nathan, you’re soaked. What are you doing?

54
00:05:23,473 --> 00:05:25,553
I just went for a run to clear my head,

55
00:05:26,381 --> 00:05:27,933
I guess this is where I ended up.

56
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:33,264
Look, Haley, the picture of Peyton didn’t mean anything, okay?

57
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:36,826
It did to me. Clearly you still have feelings for her.

58
00:05:37,804 --> 00:05:39,976
I saved that picture back when we were still dating.

59
00:05:40,694 --> 00:05:42,869
The other ones too, you can go back and look.

60
00:05:43,241 --> 00:05:45,597
Her web cam hasn’t even been in her closet for months.

61
00:05:46,667 --> 00:05:48,393
Why didn’t you tell me that last week?

62
00:05:48,567 --> 00:05:52,048
Because, I should have deleted those images a long time ago.

63
00:05:52,498 --> 00:05:55,223
I just felt bad because I didn’t do it.

64
00:05:57,250 --> 00:06:01,853
Besides, Haley, I don’t want Peyton. I want you.

65
00:06:02,677 --> 00:06:03,815
Is that it?

66
00:06:05,458 --> 00:06:09,339
You know, my pride says yeah, that’s it. Just walk away

67
00:06:09,391 --> 00:06:13,599
and let Haley deal with the fact that she’s clearly threatened by a sexual relationship.

68
00:06:14,549 --> 00:06:19,067
But my heart says, just forget about your pride you idiot.

69
00:06:20,184 --> 00:06:21,268
You love this girl.

70
00:06:23,363 --> 00:06:27,094
And even if you’re going to catch pneumonia, your ass is going to stand out here in the rain

71
00:06:28,892 --> 00:06:31,620
till you convince her to forgive you.

72
00:06:35,846 --> 00:06:39,492
So come on, Hales, just meet me half way here?

73
00:06:40,986 --> 00:06:41,922
Why should I?

74
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:44,124
Because I’m sorry.

75
00:06:46,127 --> 00:06:47,151
Because I love you.

76
00:06:49,506 --> 00:06:52,147
And Because you’re looking really hot standing out here in the rain,

77
00:06:52,265 --> 00:06:54,210
and I’m thinking, I have to kiss you.

78
00:06:57,835 --> 00:06:59,096
Well, if you have to.

79
00:07:15,162 --> 00:07:15,880
Hey.

80
00:07:16,298 --> 00:07:16,784
Hey.

81
00:07:17,154 --> 00:07:22,059
This is your night, this is your gym. Take no prisoners. Hands in.

82
00:07:23,101 --> 00:07:24,470
Let’s win this one for Whitey.

83
00:07:24,997 --> 00:07:27,950
Hey, forget the old man, you win it for yourselves.

84
00:07:28,029 --> 00:07:31,654
Come on boys! When are we going to lose? 1...2...3...Nevermore!

85
00:07:33,138 --> 00:07:35,908
Hey, there’s no name on your jersey.

86
00:07:36,728 --> 00:07:37,819
Yeah there is.

87
00:07:38,776 --> 00:07:39,651
Right there.

88
00:07:40,175 --> 00:07:42,662
So Ravens take the floor and we’re all set to go.

89
00:07:53,573 --> 00:07:56,615
Listen... I talked to my mom.

90
00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:02,441
And I guess I’m sorry for resenting you for not wanting to be in my life.

91
00:08:03,941 --> 00:08:05,775
I didn’t know you wanted custody.

92
00:08:08,928 --> 00:08:12,157
I also never said thank you for rescuing me from the accident.

93
00:08:12,616 --> 00:08:16,721
You should be on the floor by now for practice. Go run 21 sprints.

94
00:08:30,844 --> 00:08:32,270
You better watch that bad shoulder.

95
00:08:33,678 --> 00:08:35,255
You better watch the score board.

96
00:08:35,951 --> 00:08:38,951
Here we go, ravens fans, the playoffs are underway.

97
00:08:39,253 --> 00:08:43,980
Ravens control the tip, Nathan Scott brings it up court to the pride of his hometown crowd.

98
00:08:44,072 --> 00:08:46,817
I’ll tell you, there’s a lot of love in the air tonight.

99
00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:54,522
That seat’s reserved for my friend Peyton.

100
00:08:55,114 --> 00:08:56,237
You’re  friend, huh?

101
00:08:58,546 --> 00:08:59,867
As far as she knows.

102
00:09:02,177 --> 00:09:03,584
So where is Jake, Brooke?

103
00:09:04,926 --> 00:09:06,948
Buy me a drink and maybe I’ll tell you.

104
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:22,052
Early in the second quarter, this Masonboro team,  big underdogs,

105
00:09:22,139 --> 00:09:24,043
are giving the ravens all they can handle.

106
00:09:24,521 --> 00:09:27,613
- All night, baby, all night.
- Shut up, you little punk.

107
00:09:28,709 --> 00:09:32,789
It could be the time away, or maybe Dan Scott’s influence, but whatever the reason,

108
00:09:32,881 --> 00:09:36,628
the players have dug themselves a whole and they’re looking at a long road back.

109
00:09:41,995 --> 00:09:43,178
Did you even love me, Karen?

110
00:09:43,859 --> 00:09:45,344
Keith,  I do love you.

111
00:09:46,197 --> 00:09:47,376
Not like that.

112
00:09:52,845 --> 00:09:54,114
I don’t know how to answer that.

113
00:09:54,723 --> 00:09:56,986
You don’t know how to, or you don’t want to?

114
00:09:59,218 --> 00:10:01,297
Keith, I don’t want you to leave like this.

115
00:10:03,171 --> 00:10:04,467
It’s a little late for that.

116
00:10:06,009 --> 00:10:10,899
But at least let’s tell the truth. Okay?

117
00:10:12,184 --> 00:10:15,671
I’m not leaving for a job or some fresh perspective

118
00:10:15,726 --> 00:10:17,642
or because I wanted to get out of this town.

119
00:10:19,284 --> 00:10:22,576
I’m leaving because I can’t look at you anymore without my heart breaking.

120
00:10:25,665 --> 00:10:28,527
How many serious relationships have you had since Dan?

121
00:10:28,941 --> 00:10:31,301
I’ll tell you. None.

122
00:10:32,208 --> 00:10:33,581
Why are you doing this?

123
00:10:36,191 --> 00:10:41,470
Karen, it was a dark day when you said no to my proposal.

124
00:10:41,690 --> 00:10:45,561
But, you know, I can live with that. I don’t need you to love me.

125
00:10:47,541 --> 00:10:49,917
But you got to open up your heart to somebody.

126
00:10:51,281 --> 00:10:55,678
You got to let someone discover how staggering you are.

127
00:10:58,211 --> 00:11:00,885
Just don’t be alone, that I can’t live with.

128
00:11:05,073 --> 00:11:07,383
The ravens grab the rebound and push it up court.

129
00:11:07,593 --> 00:11:11,515
Tim Smith passes to Lucas Scott, over to Nathan Scott for the slam!

130
00:11:11,765 --> 00:11:13,835
I see the Ravens are finally working together.

131
00:11:13,909 --> 00:11:15,009
Go ravens!

132
00:11:17,403 --> 00:11:18,790
You know you can trust me.

133
00:11:20,813 --> 00:11:25,245
Brooke, it’s really important to me that Nikki never finds out where Jake took Jenny.

134
00:11:25,313 --> 00:11:27,110
I know it’s important to you, Peyton.

135
00:11:28,155 --> 00:11:30,283
That’s why you can trust me with this.

136
00:11:31,877 --> 00:11:33,192
But she still hasn’t told you?

137
00:11:33,582 --> 00:11:36,634
No, but she will. She thinks we’re tight again.

138
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:42,348
Not that I care, but, you must really hate Peyton to betray her trust like this.

139
00:11:42,645 --> 00:11:44,769
Yeah, well, she’s got it coming.

140
00:11:45,028 --> 00:11:49,418
If Jake and Jenny meant anything to her, she’ll know what it feels like to have her heart crushed, won’t she?

141
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:52,239
Fine by me.

142
00:11:57,873 --> 00:12:00,513
Coming up on half time and Ravens continue the lead.

143
00:12:01,225 --> 00:12:03,513
Lucas Scott with the ball that leads to Nathan.

144
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:06,690
Caw! The birds have taken flight.

145
00:12:07,130 --> 00:12:10,930
They look a lot sharper now, but something tells me Masonboro isn’t going away.

146
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:14,880
You okay, mom?

147
00:12:17,702 --> 00:12:22,683
I am having a problem letting you go. You’re just a kid, Luke.

148
00:12:23,902 --> 00:12:27,635
Part of me says that you are too young for this, I know I’m too young for it.

149
00:12:29,713 --> 00:12:33,472
You know this isn’t about me wanting to leave you, right? Because it’s not.

150
00:12:33,518 --> 00:12:38,305
Then what is it about? Explain it to me again, why you want to leave.

151
00:12:39,247 --> 00:12:41,253
Do you remember when I first joined the team?

152
00:12:42,319 --> 00:12:44,782
You know, the boosters treated you poorly.

153
00:12:45,463 --> 00:12:47,900
You wanted them to see who you’d become.

154
00:12:48,924 --> 00:12:51,826
And they could only see who you used to be.

155
00:12:52,611 --> 00:12:55,591
Or at least who they thought you were.

156
00:12:58,140 --> 00:12:59,881
I need a chance to start over.

157
00:13:01,797 --> 00:13:03,624
And I don’t want Keith to be alone either.

158
00:13:04,294 --> 00:13:05,498
At least for a little while.

159
00:13:09,564 --> 00:13:11,703
I told him he could join you in Charleston.

160
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:19,655
I want you to know, I’ll protect him with my life this time.

161
00:13:20,726 --> 00:13:21,759
I know you will.

162
00:13:23,899 --> 00:13:25,369
Other wise I wouldn’t allow it.

163
00:13:29,267 --> 00:13:32,655
No one’s ever asked me if I would ever trust you again.

164
00:13:34,625 --> 00:13:37,870
And you need to know that if this was anybody else I wouldn’t let him go.

165
00:13:41,619 --> 00:13:43,238
That means a lot to me.

166
00:13:47,707 --> 00:13:49,459
I guess I should go then.

167
00:14:01,046 --> 00:14:02,407
I’m sorry, Keith.

168
00:14:14,211 --> 00:14:15,182
Me too.

169
00:14:18,469 --> 00:14:19,964
- Want a towel?
- Yes.

170
00:14:24,009 --> 00:14:25,689
- Well that was a nice walk. 
- Yeah.

171
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:34,658
What?

172
00:14:44,778 --> 00:14:45,565
Haley.

173
00:14:46,676 --> 00:14:47,603
No, it’s okay.

174
00:14:48,908 --> 00:14:49,881
It’s okay.

175
00:15:01,849 --> 00:15:04,744
The ravens lead a close one by two as we come up on half time.

176
00:15:05,391 --> 00:15:08,020
Daniel Lawrence gives it to Tim who dribbles out top.

177
00:15:08,569 --> 00:15:14,194
Luke breaks free on the wing, puts up a three pointer, release rotation, splash, ravens lead it by five.

178
00:15:15,528 --> 00:15:19,500
Time for score at half time, ravens 34 and bears 39.

179
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:22,230
This is web cast at ravenshoops.com.

180
00:15:24,733 --> 00:15:28,645
Wow. Masonboro just hit Lucas Scott with a cheap shot.

181
00:15:28,711 --> 00:15:30,485
Nathan comes to his defense and things are getting ugly

182
00:15:30,561 --> 00:15:33,437
as the refs hurry back to the floor to try and break up a brawl.

183
00:15:34,077 --> 00:15:37,230
Lucas Scott is still down protecting his bad shoulder.

184
00:15:46,006 --> 00:15:47,763
So Jake went to Savannah?

185
00:15:48,818 --> 00:15:50,455
He’s got family there.

186
00:15:51,142 --> 00:15:54,951
I don’t know if we would have been anything, you know, but I really loved Jenny.

187
00:15:55,366 --> 00:15:57,403
And I worry about them.

188
00:15:58,563 --> 00:16:00,015
I’m glad you told me, Peyton.

189
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:02,913
You know I’m here for you.

190
00:16:04,198 --> 00:16:05,463
I know you are.

191
00:16:06,359 --> 00:16:07,577
What if we’re not good together?

192
00:16:08,284 --> 00:16:10,818
- What if it drives us apart?
- It won’t.

193
00:16:13,204 --> 00:16:15,965
Look, Haley, I want to be with you.

194
00:16:17,976 --> 00:16:20,648
And if you don’t want to be with me, I guess I understand,

195
00:16:21,716 --> 00:16:24,095
but, this isn’t going to change anything.

196
00:16:26,731 --> 00:16:27,908
Tonight then.

197
00:16:29,059 --> 00:16:30,254
After the game.

198
00:16:32,932 --> 00:16:35,062
Already making plans for after the game, boys?

199
00:16:35,426 --> 00:16:36,914
Because this is a joke!

200
00:16:37,499 --> 00:16:39,879
You  guys are up five points, you should be up fifty points.

201
00:16:39,978 --> 00:16:43,924
Oh and while you have your heads up your asses, why don’t you take a whiff of how you’ve been playing.

202
00:16:44,473 --> 00:16:46,300
Tim, turnovers. Nathan, focus.

203
00:16:48,527 --> 00:16:49,781
Hey, come here.

204
00:16:52,211 --> 00:16:53,038
How are we doing?

205
00:16:53,213 --> 00:16:55,763
Coach, we should get him x-rayed. I think he’s done for the night.

206
00:16:55,837 --> 00:16:57,723
Whoa, whoa. Are you sure?

207
00:16:57,805 --> 00:16:59,535
Well I can’t be sure without the x-ray.

208
00:16:59,699 --> 00:17:02,890
But if he were my kid, I wouldn’t risk it. And considering the rehab-

209
00:17:05,147 --> 00:17:07,323
Hey. How you doing?

210
00:17:07,831 --> 00:17:11,189
It just feels a little weird. What’d the doc say?

211
00:17:11,251 --> 00:17:14,313
He said you’d be fine. But if you want to sit out, I can’t make you play.

212
00:17:15,019 --> 00:17:16,601
But your teammates are counting on you.

213
00:17:17,343 --> 00:17:18,408
I’ll be fine.

214
00:17:20,169 --> 00:17:20,984
Good man.

215
00:17:23,304 --> 00:17:24,942
Kid says he wants to play, doc.

216
00:17:25,024 --> 00:17:27,706
But I’ll tell you what, as soon as the game’s over, we’ll get him an x-ray, okay?

217
00:17:36,593 --> 00:17:37,496
You good, man?

218
00:17:39,366 --> 00:17:43,927
Good. Cause all this means nothing if you can’t knock down that shot.

219
00:17:47,462 --> 00:17:49,518
Do you know about my dad’s state championship game?

220
00:17:50,773 --> 00:17:52,824
Yeah, Whitey benched Dan.

221
00:17:53,316 --> 00:17:55,733
Not exactly. That’s Whitey’s story.

222
00:17:56,645 --> 00:17:59,415
See, they were leading, and Whitey wanted to go into a stall.

223
00:17:59,815 --> 00:18:05,846
My dad didn’t want to, so at the end of the game, with everything on the line, he sat down.

224
00:18:06,117 --> 00:18:07,398
Refused to go back into the game.

225
00:18:08,263 --> 00:18:08,877
Really?

226
00:18:09,097 --> 00:18:13,813
Yeah. The way my dad sees it, he lost the game, but won the argument.

227
00:18:16,326 --> 00:18:17,821
I couldn’t do that to my teammates.

228
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:19,142
Yeah, me neither.

229
00:18:19,926 --> 00:18:22,475
Although if we lose this game, I’m going back to hating you.

230
00:18:24,219 --> 00:18:27,620
Well, it’s the Scott boys. Together.

231
00:18:28,027 --> 00:18:30,648
My eyes really must be screwed up.

232
00:18:31,093 --> 00:18:31,861
Hey, coach.

233
00:18:32,424 --> 00:18:34,267
We wanted to catch you before you went to the hospital.

234
00:18:34,655 --> 00:18:35,783
Glad you did.

235
00:18:36,838 --> 00:18:38,911
How’s practice going with Danny?

236
00:18:40,025 --> 00:18:42,535
The same as with you. It sucks.

237
00:18:45,527 --> 00:18:50,514
Well, coach, the players, we all signed this ball for you.

238
00:18:50,841 --> 00:18:52,014
Sort of a get well card.

239
00:18:54,518 --> 00:18:58,377
You know, I’ve been around this game practically my whole life.

240
00:19:00,021 --> 00:19:04,143
And there’s never been a day that I was as gifted as either one of you.

241
00:19:05,043 --> 00:19:06,083
Remember that.

242
00:19:08,361 --> 00:19:10,609
Don’t let Danny take that from you.

243
00:19:12,293 --> 00:19:14,367
You boys play with your whole hearts.

244
00:19:16,185 --> 00:19:20,399
You take your shots, no regrets.

245
00:19:28,023 --> 00:19:30,362
Reverse lay up by the ravens for another two.

246
00:19:30,864 --> 00:19:34,305
Nathan and Lucas Scott have taken over, keeping the ravens in close,

247
00:19:34,361 --> 00:19:39,619
but it may be too little too late as Masonboro leads it by five, time running out in the forth.

248
00:19:39,804 --> 00:19:41,441
Oh man, I’m scared.

249
00:19:45,457 --> 00:19:46,368
Lucas!

250
00:19:48,959 --> 00:19:50,443
Luke, I’m scared.

251
00:19:56,387 --> 00:19:58,665
Luke, this is so not cool.

252
00:19:58,993 --> 00:20:01,119
Come out here right now, Lucas Scott.

253
00:20:03,885 --> 00:20:06,981
Damn it, Haley. You’re going to kill me.

254
00:20:07,652 --> 00:20:09,131
You know Houdini died like that.

255
00:20:09,328 --> 00:20:10,866
You deserve it, dumb ass.

256
00:20:11,497 --> 00:20:13,899
I told you, I didn’t want to take this shortcut.

257
00:20:14,963 --> 00:20:16,100
What are you whispering for?

258
00:20:16,652 --> 00:20:17,473
Because.

259
00:20:18,091 --> 00:20:20,733
Haley, these people, they’re dead.

260
00:20:20,821 --> 00:20:24,553
I know, but if you keep yelling, the stinking zombies are going to hear us.

261
00:20:27,067 --> 00:20:27,775
Haley.

262
00:20:29,735 --> 00:20:31,576
- What?
- Look, I’ve got to tell you something.

263
00:20:32,638 --> 00:20:35,213
What is her name and what did you do that you regret?

264
00:20:37,368 --> 00:20:38,900
I’m going to Charleston with Keith.

265
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,426
Alright, for how long?

266
00:20:41,874 --> 00:20:44,403
For good. I’m moving there.

267
00:20:45,171 --> 00:20:46,472
What are you talking about?

268
00:20:46,831 --> 00:20:48,325
Keith got a job in Charleston.

269
00:20:49,228 --> 00:20:52,678
And I’m going to go live with him there, after the season’s over.

270
00:20:53,983 --> 00:20:56,241
Haley, I need to go.

271
00:20:57,759 --> 00:20:59,876
- Come no, don’t do that.
- Don’t do what?!

272
00:21:00,275 --> 00:21:03,086
You can not bring me out in the middle of a creepy cemetery

273
00:21:03,137 --> 00:21:06,082
and tell me that you are leaving Tree Hill for good, that is not fair!

274
00:21:06,153 --> 00:21:09,409
Haley, come on, it’s not that far. I’ll still see you.

275
00:21:09,527 --> 00:21:13,127
Not like now. Who’s going to go thrift store hunting with me, Lucas?

276
00:21:13,183 --> 00:21:17,202
Who’s going to buy bad music or lie to the campus lost and found and claim dumb stuff?

277
00:21:17,270 --> 00:21:18,400
Who’s going to do that with me?

278
00:21:19,543 --> 00:21:20,244
Nathan.

279
00:21:21,811 --> 00:21:22,782
And me, too.

280
00:21:23,332 --> 00:21:24,248
Once and a while.

281
00:21:25,103 --> 00:21:27,719
Look, I’ve thought a lot about this, Haley. Okay?

282
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:32,941
And I feel like I can be a better person if I go now.

283
00:21:35,425 --> 00:21:37,482
I am sure going to miss you.

284
00:21:39,343 --> 00:21:40,940
You’re my best friend, Hales.

285
00:21:41,793 --> 00:21:42,950
You always will be.

286
00:21:46,352 --> 00:21:47,333
Idiot.

287
00:21:49,489 --> 00:21:50,171
Come here.

288
00:21:55,396 --> 00:21:56,218
You okay?

289
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:58,399
No, I’m scared again.

290
00:22:01,234 --> 00:22:05,766
No going back now, folks. This is it. Down by two, less than a minute on the clock.

291
00:22:05,843 --> 00:22:07,343
The ravens need a stop.

292
00:22:07,839 --> 00:22:09,234
You got anything left in that shoulder?

293
00:22:10,404 --> 00:22:11,286
A little bit.

294
00:22:11,863 --> 00:22:14,163
Come on, man. Let’s take this thing.

295
00:22:15,310 --> 00:22:18,977
Masonboro inbound, full court pressure by the ravens with under 20 seconds.

296
00:22:19,027 --> 00:22:21,480
- No fouls!
- Dan Scott calls for no fouls.

297
00:22:21,634 --> 00:22:24,336
Time is running out and he wants the birds to make a play.

298
00:22:24,892 --> 00:22:30,091
At half court, Lucas Scott pokes the ball free. Nathan Scott grabs it and time out.

299
00:22:30,158 --> 00:22:35,119
A sensational steel. The Ravens have it, down by two, 12 seconds left in the game.

300
00:22:35,329 --> 00:22:38,790
Okay,  bring it in. Bring it in.

301
00:22:40,129 --> 00:22:44,104
Look at me, look at me. Who out there is scared? Who’s scared?

302
00:22:44,504 --> 00:22:47,382
Cause if you’re scared you sit your ass on this bench I don’t want you on that court.

303
00:22:47,505 --> 00:22:50,372
Nathan, look at me. Get the ball in your hands, okay?

304
00:22:50,454 --> 00:22:54,105
Hold the ball tough till there’s five seconds left on the clock then you bang inside and tie this thing up.

305
00:22:54,166 --> 00:22:56,751
- But they’re going to double him.
- I don’t care if they put five guys on him, Tim!

306
00:22:56,812 --> 00:22:59,716
Listen to me, five seconds, okay? Then you shove it down their throats.

307
00:22:59,792 --> 00:23:02,041
Great players make great plays, Nathan. Hands in.

308
00:23:02,138 --> 00:23:05,353
Let’s go. Win it on 3. 1...2...3.. Win it!

309
00:23:09,804 --> 00:23:13,132
Hey, it means nothing if you can’t knock down the shot.

310
00:23:13,812 --> 00:23:17,007
So the Ravens break the huddle. 12 seconds left on the clock.

311
00:23:17,123 --> 00:23:20,744
They need a basket to tie, a three pointer to win, or their season is over.

312
00:23:20,990 --> 00:23:25,061
The standing room crowd is on their feet. Lucas Scott will throw it in.

313
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:28,881
He does safety. Finds Tim Smith who immediately swings it to Nathan Scott.

314
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:33,719
We’re at eight seconds. Now seven. Nathan works out top.

315
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:37,339
Five seconds on the clock. Now four. He spins to the basket.

316
00:23:37,481 --> 00:23:40,481
Then passes to Luke for a three pointer and the win!

317
00:24:24,377 --> 00:24:25,810
Nice work, ladies.

318
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:30,127
Undefeated regular season, conference champs and all for nothing.

319
00:24:31,831 --> 00:24:34,633
Look at me, Nathan. Cause I want to see your face when you explain to me

320
00:24:34,674 --> 00:24:36,603
why you didn’t run the play I told you to.

321
00:24:36,823 --> 00:24:40,013
Take off that jersey, you don’t deserve to wear it. None of you do!

322
00:24:45,275 --> 00:24:48,829
Do you have an answer for me yet? Because I can wait, I have no where else to be.

323
00:24:49,075 --> 00:24:53,161
And you don’t either, you want to know why? Because your season is over!

324
00:24:53,704 --> 00:24:56,300
Why did you disobey me and pass to Lucas when you knew...

325
00:24:56,361 --> 00:24:57,630
When I knew what, dad?

326
00:24:58,010 --> 00:25:00,462
That Lucas shouldn’t have been in that game because of his injury?

327
00:25:00,908 --> 00:25:02,536
Because we both knew that, didn’t we?

328
00:25:02,603 --> 00:25:03,345
Watch it.

329
00:25:04,123 --> 00:25:05,602
I should have hit the shot.

330
00:25:06,949 --> 00:25:09,540
- It’s my fault.
- You’re damn right it’s your fault.

331
00:25:10,088 --> 00:25:11,527
You let your teammates down.

332
00:25:11,654 --> 00:25:13,814
Teammates you shouldn’t have had in the first place, by the way.

333
00:25:13,939 --> 00:25:16,467
At least he took a shot. Unlike you.

334
00:25:16,554 --> 00:25:18,700
- What did you say to me?
- You heard what I said.

335
00:25:18,771 --> 00:25:21,916
I said at least he took a shot. That’s more than you did, right dad?

336
00:25:21,977 --> 00:25:23,359
I wouldn’t go there if I were you, Nathan.

337
00:25:23,430 --> 00:25:27,670
Why not? You’re talking about letting down our teammates. Lucas was there all game.

338
00:25:27,732 --> 00:25:29,924
He played in pain with an injury you knew about.

339
00:25:30,547 --> 00:25:32,523
But he wasn’t a coward like you were.

340
00:25:32,754 --> 00:25:36,544
Tim, go get security. Tell them my son has been beaten to death.

341
00:25:36,906 --> 00:25:41,817
We played hard. And we lost. We have nothing to be ashamed of.

342
00:25:45,231 --> 00:25:46,763
Except maybe our coach.

343
00:25:54,295 --> 00:25:55,493
No regrets.

344
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:21,447
It was a tough loss.

345
00:26:23,077 --> 00:26:25,025
Well if it isn’t the Fredo of the family.

346
00:26:25,839 --> 00:26:27,423
How’s that employment line, boozie?

347
00:26:30,756 --> 00:26:34,649
I just came by to let you know that I’m leaving.

348
00:26:36,750 --> 00:26:37,486
Really?

349
00:26:41,066 --> 00:26:42,203
So what’d you do with the ring?

350
00:26:43,861 --> 00:26:45,796
I mean if you’re finally leaving town after all these years

351
00:26:45,858 --> 00:26:48,132
that means you proposed to Karen, and she said no.

352
00:26:49,211 --> 00:26:50,323
So what’d you do with the ring?

353
00:26:51,301 --> 00:26:52,402
I’m driving it.

354
00:26:53,170 --> 00:26:54,546
‘89 Land Cruiser.

355
00:26:56,831 --> 00:26:58,191
I could have given you a better deal.

356
00:27:02,108 --> 00:27:04,050
Well, I’ll consider that your goodbye.

357
00:27:06,541 --> 00:27:07,365
Keith.

358
00:27:11,223 --> 00:27:11,699
Yeah?

359
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:16,199
Never mind.

360
00:27:29,905 --> 00:27:31,749
- Hey.
- Hey.

361
00:27:31,811 --> 00:27:33,899
I just wanted to make sure you were okay.

362
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:39,538
I’m leaving tomorrow, Haley.

363
00:27:40,905 --> 00:27:42,010
Already?

364
00:27:43,290 --> 00:27:43,837
Yeah.

365
00:27:46,946 --> 00:27:47,754
Okay.

366
00:27:48,433 --> 00:27:50,100
Hey. It’s okay.

367
00:27:51,003 --> 00:27:57,933
No it’s not, I really wanted to spend your last night with you, but Nathan’s waiting.

368
00:27:58,037 --> 00:27:59,434
Hey, go.

369
00:28:00,794 --> 00:28:02,936
I’ve got to get my shoulder checked out anyway.

370
00:28:04,609 --> 00:28:07,559
I’ll find you before I leave tomorrow, okay?

371
00:28:11,085 --> 00:28:12,879
I’m really going to miss you, Luke.

372
00:28:15,219 --> 00:28:16,360
I’ll miss you, too.

373
00:28:18,771 --> 00:28:19,744
Okay, bye.

374
00:28:36,713 --> 00:28:38,053
- Hey.
- Sorry about the game.

375
00:28:38,387 --> 00:28:38,960
Yeah.

376
00:28:42,106 --> 00:28:44,054
Hales, don’t cry.

377
00:28:47,910 --> 00:28:51,849
- Haley, we don’t have to do this tonight.
- No, no I want to.

378
00:28:52,703 --> 00:28:53,527
More than ever.

379
00:28:55,847 --> 00:28:56,793
You sure?

380
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:01,412
Yeah.

381
00:29:02,836 --> 00:29:03,910
No regrets.

382
00:29:19,741 --> 00:29:20,566
Hey.

383
00:29:21,228 --> 00:29:21,942
Hey.

384
00:29:22,737 --> 00:29:25,547
I told you I’d help you burn Dan’s stuff if you wanted.

385
00:29:28,272 --> 00:29:31,447
Normally I sit with Whitey after every home game, win or lose,

386
00:29:31,737 --> 00:29:35,144
so I hope you don’t mind.

387
00:29:38,267 --> 00:29:39,260
You leaving tomorrow?

388
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:40,319
Yeah.

389
00:29:41,702 --> 00:29:44,488
Yeah. With Lucas.

390
00:29:48,604 --> 00:29:53,668
You know, the first time I left Dan, I still believed that I could get out.

391
00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:59,687
I’d just pack my things and escape to a new life. But you can’t.

392
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:03,271
You just put a new face on the same loneliness.

393
00:30:04,537 --> 00:30:08,234
What happened to us, Keith? How did we become so broken?

394
00:30:09,969 --> 00:30:11,138
We fell in love.

395
00:30:12,970 --> 00:30:16,164
And at some point, the people that we loved forgot to love us back.

396
00:30:30,178 --> 00:30:33,696
Well I’m sorry your season’s over, Lucas, but even if the team would have won,

397
00:30:33,757 --> 00:30:36,476
your season is over anyway. No basketball.

398
00:30:44,033 --> 00:30:45,236
Maybe you shouldn’t go.

399
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:48,436
I mean with your shoulder and everything.

400
00:30:49,087 --> 00:30:51,724
Mom, it’s time.

401
00:30:55,565 --> 00:30:57,289
I’m going to go see Whitey, okay?

402
00:31:08,860 --> 00:31:09,849
Hey, coach.

403
00:31:11,102 --> 00:31:13,842
Don’t tell me. You lost at the buzzer.

404
00:31:14,747 --> 00:31:19,618
They doubled Nathan and you missed a wide open look.

405
00:31:22,201 --> 00:31:23,871
Web cast.

406
00:31:24,364 --> 00:31:26,442
Ravenshoops.com.

407
00:31:28,723 --> 00:31:31,670
Well it was a good look. Let it go.

408
00:31:35,670 --> 00:31:42,140
Doc says this eye thing might be a little more complicated than they thought it was.

409
00:31:43,958 --> 00:31:46,810
Coach, you’re going to be okay, right?

410
00:31:49,185 --> 00:31:50,031
We’ll see.

411
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:55,990
Look, I just wanted you to know,

412
00:31:57,384 --> 00:31:59,779
that I really appreciate everything you’ve done for me.

413
00:32:01,352 --> 00:32:02,496
You believed in me.

414
00:32:04,016 --> 00:32:06,077
And for that I will always owe you.

415
00:32:08,235 --> 00:32:09,589
You want to do me a favor?

416
00:32:10,695 --> 00:32:11,192
Sure.

417
00:32:11,870 --> 00:32:13,311
Take care of Keith.

418
00:32:14,587 --> 00:32:16,015
He’s a good man.

419
00:32:17,418 --> 00:32:18,565
So are you, coach.

420
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:11,030
Damn it.

421
00:33:18,434 --> 00:33:24,357
Question. Who is sexy, talented, and knows where Jake is?

422
00:33:24,976 --> 00:33:26,001
Oh I know, it’s me.

423
00:33:27,239 --> 00:33:28,196
So where is he?

424
00:33:29,123 --> 00:33:31,182
Tell you what. I’ll play you for it.

425
00:33:31,295 --> 00:33:33,558
You beat me, I’ll tell you where he went.

426
00:33:34,279 --> 00:33:37,382
I don’t want to play games, Brooke. Just tell me where Jake took Jenny.

427
00:33:52,722 --> 00:33:54,049
So that’s it, huh?

428
00:33:55,459 --> 00:33:58,181
Betrayal of Peyton complete. How does it feel?

429
00:33:58,482 --> 00:34:01,411
It feels like you should be gone by now because you got your information.

430
00:34:02,492 --> 00:34:06,925
You know, Brooke, you should really try to be a better person. No body likes a bitch.

431
00:34:21,738 --> 00:34:23,576
Was that Nikki you were talking to?

432
00:34:24,368 --> 00:34:27,533
Yeah. I told her where Jake went.

433
00:34:30,468 --> 00:34:33,053
And she bought it, just like we planned.

434
00:34:33,821 --> 00:34:36,095
It’s going to be a long road trip to Seattle.

435
00:34:38,709 --> 00:34:40,718
I told you, Peyton, I’m here for you.

436
00:34:41,332 --> 00:34:42,070
I know you are.

437
00:34:54,094 --> 00:34:56,000
Look, it’s not what it looks like.

438
00:34:56,307 --> 00:34:58,919
No? Because it looked like you were having sex with my wife.

439
00:34:59,202 --> 00:35:03,656
Unless of course you both tripped and fell. Your clothes fell off and somehow you ended up on top of her.

440
00:35:03,697 --> 00:35:08,309
What I mean is, this hasn’t been going on, okay? It just happened.

441
00:35:08,361 --> 00:35:10,138
You listen to me, you son of a bitch.

442
00:35:10,246 --> 00:35:12,191
Those are the last words you’re ever going to speak to me.

443
00:35:12,294 --> 00:35:14,478
You are no longer my brother. You understand that?

444
00:35:15,733 --> 00:35:17,361
You do not exist to me.

445
00:35:34,614 --> 00:35:38,641
I told you if you missed that shot it was all for nothing. I was wrong.

446
00:35:40,691 --> 00:35:42,548
I figured I’d find you out here.

447
00:35:43,886 --> 00:35:45,261
Word is you’re leaving town.

448
00:35:45,829 --> 00:35:49,331
Yeah. I’m just meeting the guys to say goodbye.

449
00:35:50,997 --> 00:35:52,470
You leaving because of the game?

450
00:35:53,090 --> 00:35:53,863
Nah.

451
00:35:56,605 --> 00:35:58,630
Keith needs to be with someone right now.

452
00:35:59,951 --> 00:36:01,144
I need a change.

453
00:36:03,137 --> 00:36:05,695
I figured since the season’s over, it’s time.

454
00:36:07,891 --> 00:36:12,157
Plus, I know I’m leaving Haley in good hands.

455
00:36:16,919 --> 00:36:18,142
I got to tell you, man.

456
00:36:19,299 --> 00:36:24,035
I never thought, when we played that one on one game, that I’d end up back here, feeling like this.

457
00:36:24,973 --> 00:36:25,673
Like what?

458
00:36:27,056 --> 00:36:28,162
Like I’m going to miss you.

459
00:36:32,325 --> 00:36:33,681
You’ve got to do what you feel.

460
00:36:34,951 --> 00:36:36,938
I actually wish you weren’t going to leave.

461
00:36:39,247 --> 00:36:41,893
Because you’re one hell of a basketball player.

462
00:36:44,633 --> 00:36:46,010
And because you’re my brother.

463
00:36:50,353 --> 00:36:51,699
Take care of yourself, man.

464
00:36:53,199 --> 00:36:54,536
You take care of Haley.

465
00:37:01,606 --> 00:37:04,126
I’ll miss you too, little brother.

466
00:37:26,408 --> 00:37:27,283
You all set?

467
00:37:30,002 --> 00:37:31,087
Yeah, almost.

468
00:37:35,006 --> 00:37:36,403
Come here, I want to talk to you a minute.

469
00:37:43,012 --> 00:37:45,029
I know you’re searching for things, Lucas.

470
00:37:46,273 --> 00:37:50,083
And I hope with all my heart that you find the answers to your questions.

471
00:37:51,426 --> 00:37:55,010
But the answers that you’re looking for are closer than you think.

472
00:37:57,329 --> 00:37:58,548
They’re in your heart.

473
00:37:59,663 --> 00:38:04,881
And in the hearts of those who love you. And that is right here. At home.

474
00:38:06,464 --> 00:38:11,619
In your life you’re going to go to some great places, and you’re going to do some wonderful things.

475
00:38:13,118 --> 00:38:16,534
But no matter where you go, or who you become,

476
00:38:17,748 --> 00:38:20,129
this place will always be with you.

477
00:38:29,586 --> 00:38:31,669
There is only one Tree Hill.

478
00:38:33,769 --> 00:38:35,273
And it’s your home.

479
00:38:41,350 --> 00:38:42,718
I love you, my boy.

480
00:38:45,026 --> 00:38:46,163
I love you, too.

481
00:39:15,137 --> 00:39:17,165
It looks like a beautiful morning.

482
00:39:17,646 --> 00:39:18,471
It’s perfect.

483
00:39:20,223 --> 00:39:21,717
Let’s do something great today.

484
00:40:18,738 --> 00:40:20,546
We have your test results.

485
00:40:47,661 --> 00:40:51,692
Dan! Can you hear me?

486
00:40:53,351 --> 00:40:58,489
Deb, you better hope I die.

487
00:41:08,672 --> 00:41:11,603
Hey, is Haley here?

488
00:41:12,141 --> 00:41:14,799
- I promised her I’d see her before I left.
- Yeah, come on in.

489
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:24,122
- Nathan, where’s your sweatshirt?
- It’s in the bathroom.

490
00:41:29,283 --> 00:41:29,990
Hey.

491
00:41:31,009 --> 00:41:33,860
Hey, um, you know, I’m sorry to...

492
00:41:34,966 --> 00:41:38,587
- I just wanted to say goodbye.
- No, no it’s okay. I didn’t want you to go without...

493
00:41:38,658 --> 00:41:41,449
- No, I’m sorry. I’m just going to go.
- No, Lucas, please don’t.

494
00:41:41,536 --> 00:41:43,394
Haley! It’s cool, I just...

495
00:41:45,196 --> 00:41:46,415
I thought you weren’t ready.

496
00:41:46,895 --> 00:41:48,540
I thought that you were going to wait until you got married.

497
00:41:49,247 --> 00:41:50,291
I mean, I just figured...

498
00:41:54,105 --> 00:41:56,832
- I didn’t expect you to...
- Well we did.

499
00:41:58,524 --> 00:41:59,794
We did wait.

500
00:42:03,781 --> 00:42:05,492
What are you talking about, Haley?

501
00:42:09,654 --> 00:42:11,308
We got married last night.

502
00:42:25,151 --> 00:42:29,187
Some people believe that Ravens guide travelers to their destinations.

503
00:42:30,518 --> 00:42:35,086
Others believe that the sight of a solitary raven is considered good luck.

504
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:41,134
While more than one raven together,

505
00:42:43,698 --> 00:42:45,146
predicts trouble ahead.
