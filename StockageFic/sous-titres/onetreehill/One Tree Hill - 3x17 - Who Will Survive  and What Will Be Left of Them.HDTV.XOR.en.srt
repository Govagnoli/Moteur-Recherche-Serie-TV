1
00:00:00,017 --> 00:00:01,606
Previously on "One Tree Hill"...

2
00:00:01,607 --> 00:00:03,436
Somebody has a gun inside, and they're shooting.

3
00:00:03,437 --> 00:00:05,583
- We'll get out of here, okay?
- Get away from the door.

4
00:00:05,584 --> 00:00:07,103
We got to get you somewhere safe.

5
00:00:07,104 --> 00:00:09,109
No, don't leave me, please.

6
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:11,917
You're gonna tape a line down the center of the room. Go on!

7
00:00:12,168 --> 00:00:18,294
If I say I love you right now, will you hold it against me?

8
00:00:19,287 --> 00:00:21,413
- Don't push me.
- He's not gonna do it!

9
00:00:21,414 --> 00:00:23,053
- Back him up!
- Listen to him!

10
00:00:23,528 --> 00:00:27,374
I promise you, whoever steps into that hallway is gonna die.

11
00:00:27,372 --> 00:00:29,213
It's never gonna be the same.

12
00:00:29,212 --> 00:00:31,198
This is wrong, man, all of this.

13
00:00:31,204 --> 00:00:32,171
This is your fault.

14
00:00:32,175 --> 00:00:33,684
I just wanted it to stop.

15
00:00:33,685 --> 00:00:35,149
Just take it all back.

16
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:37,657
Let me talk to him.
Jimmy, please.

17
00:00:38,238 --> 00:00:40,647
- I'm sorry.
- No!

18
00:00:41,582 --> 00:00:43,977
He's gone, Danny. He's gone.

19
00:00:57,525 --> 00:00:59,709
Over here, Danny! I found something.

20
00:01:02,178 --> 00:01:03,399
It's a raven.

21
00:01:03,986 --> 00:01:05,500
What's wrong with it?

22
00:01:05,501 --> 00:01:07,264
I think its wing is broken.

23
00:01:07,265 --> 00:01:09,333
We can nurse him back to health.

24
00:01:09,585 --> 00:01:11,253
Come on, help me catch him.

25
00:01:12,521 --> 00:01:14,420
He'll fly again. You'll see.

26
00:01:17,058 --> 00:01:20,467
No! Why did you do that? Why'd you kill him?

27
00:01:20,468 --> 00:01:21,997
He was weak.

28
00:01:24,884 --> 00:01:26,360
I want to go home.

29
00:01:34,655 --> 00:01:37,166
"Oh, that I had the wings of a dove.

30
00:01:37,319 --> 00:01:40,731
I would fly away and be at rest.

31
00:01:42,509 --> 00:01:45,065
My companion attacks his friends.

32
00:01:45,228 --> 00:01:47,313
He violates his covenant.

33
00:01:47,535 --> 00:01:51,337
His speech is smooth, yet war is in his heart.

34
00:01:52,335 --> 00:01:57,756
But you, oh, god, will bring down the wicked into the pit of corruption.

35
00:01:58,241 --> 00:02:02,600
Bloodthirsty and deceitful men will not live out half their days.

36
00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:06,854
As for me, I trust in you."

37
00:02:07,982 --> 00:02:12,805
And now we ask for the strength to navigate the stages of our grief

38
00:02:13,089 --> 00:02:15,559
as we lay our brother Keith to rest.

39
00:02:28,484 --> 00:02:30,470
The stages of our grief --

40
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:34,780
anger, fear, guilt,

41
00:02:35,236 --> 00:02:36,521
depression...

42
00:02:37,848 --> 00:02:39,475
acceptance.

43
00:02:54,010 --> 00:02:55,145
Dan.

44
00:03:02,465 --> 00:03:04,770
And the first seeds of grief --

45
00:03:26,769 --> 00:03:30,376
I guess everybody's just gonna change and go back to Karen's.

46
00:03:30,529 --> 00:03:32,604
People are definitely gonna change.

47
00:03:33,774 --> 00:03:35,256
Will you unzip me?

48
00:03:43,653 --> 00:03:45,017
I love you.

49
00:03:46,652 --> 00:03:48,049
I love you, too.

50
00:03:48,983 --> 00:03:50,820
It's all so uncertain.

51
00:03:52,244 --> 00:03:53,967
God, I love you.

52
00:03:54,711 --> 00:03:57,586
I never want to come that close to losing you again.

53
00:03:58,644 --> 00:04:01,151
I need you to be safe, okay?

54
00:04:03,213 --> 00:04:05,703
I told you I'm not going anywhere.

55
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:21,898
They expected 200 people at his wake.

56
00:04:22,271 --> 00:04:24,061
They got like 2,000.

57
00:04:24,062 --> 00:04:25,926
People loved Keith, you know?

58
00:04:26,339 --> 00:04:29,340
I was the worst mechanic on the planet.

59
00:04:29,849 --> 00:04:34,166
But he gave me a summer job because he knew I needed the money.

60
00:04:34,167 --> 00:04:39,253
We hung out that summer talking old-school basketball with him, me, Skills, Mouth.

61
00:04:39,254 --> 00:04:40,601
And Jimmy.

62
00:04:42,471 --> 00:04:44,621
Jim's funeral's on tuesday.

63
00:04:45,753 --> 00:04:47,896
Jimmy Edwards killed my uncle.

64
00:04:49,904 --> 00:04:53,654
Do not talk about him, not in my mother's house.

65
00:05:38,197 --> 00:05:40,694
Peyton, hi.

66
00:05:40,695 --> 00:05:41,785
Hey.

67
00:05:44,438 --> 00:05:47,513
Lucas, I'm so sorry.

68
00:05:48,067 --> 00:05:51,326
I want to thank you for saving my little girl.

69
00:05:51,717 --> 00:05:52,786
Thank you.

70
00:05:55,336 --> 00:05:56,656
Hey, buddy.

71
00:05:56,809 --> 00:05:57,756
Hey.

72
00:05:57,757 --> 00:06:00,781
I'm sorry I haven't checked in lately. I've just been with Lucas and Karen.

73
00:06:00,782 --> 00:06:02,147
Of course.

74
00:06:03,074 --> 00:06:04,453
I'm glad you're okay.

75
00:06:04,454 --> 00:06:06,818
I mean, you're gonna be okay, right?

76
00:06:07,372 --> 00:06:08,802
Yeah, I'm gonna be fine.

77
00:06:08,803 --> 00:06:11,173
I just have to do some physical therapy stuff.

78
00:06:11,570 --> 00:06:13,350
Well, can I get you anything? Any food?

79
00:06:13,351 --> 00:06:16,925
No, I'm okay, really. I just came to see Karen.

80
00:06:17,352 --> 00:06:18,345
Okay.

81
00:06:20,001 --> 00:06:21,195
Peyton.

82
00:06:23,989 --> 00:06:26,070
I'm really glad you're okay.

83
00:06:42,158 --> 00:06:45,909
We are the worst family/friends in the whole world.

84
00:06:45,910 --> 00:06:47,764
We really should be at Lucas'.

85
00:06:47,765 --> 00:06:51,213
You're right. Just stay here for a second.

86
00:06:51,901 --> 00:06:52,948
Okay.

87
00:06:54,163 --> 00:06:57,457
When  I was a kid, I had this morning paper route.

88
00:06:57,533 --> 00:07:01,626
And every morning there was this moment right around dawn,

89
00:07:01,627 --> 00:07:04,615
and I would just stop, breathe it all in.

90
00:07:06,102 --> 00:07:09,227
You could almost feel the magic in the world.

91
00:07:10,738 --> 00:07:14,168
But lying here with you, I feel that same stillness.

92
00:07:16,093 --> 00:07:20,456
And I can almost believe that the world's not as screwed up as I know it is.

93
00:07:21,883 --> 00:07:24,346
My mom's coming home. She called.

94
00:07:25,911 --> 00:07:29,211
At least you won't have to live alone in this big giant house.

95
00:07:29,212 --> 00:07:30,954
Yeah, but she will.

96
00:07:31,603 --> 00:07:33,243
I want us to live together.

97
00:07:34,010 --> 00:07:36,371
I want to be your husband again, Haley.

98
00:07:38,667 --> 00:07:40,978
That sounds so good to me.

99
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:44,213
But I have a roommate named Brooke.

100
00:07:44,214 --> 00:07:45,305
That doesn't matter.

101
00:07:45,306 --> 00:07:48,062
And our dream schools are 3,000 miles away.

102
00:07:48,063 --> 00:07:48,899
Doesn't matter.

103
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:50,363
And neither of us have jobs.

104
00:07:50,364 --> 00:07:51,784
It doesn't matter.

105
00:07:51,956 --> 00:07:54,122
You know how long it took me to realize that?

106
00:07:54,584 --> 00:07:56,903
The amount of time it takes to pull a trigger.

107
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:02,953
I love you, Haley James, and that's all I need to know.

108
00:08:03,265 --> 00:08:05,662
That doesn't mean it's not gonna be hard.

109
00:08:05,663 --> 00:08:07,226
Doesn't mean it's not gonna be confusing.

110
00:08:07,227 --> 00:08:11,319
But whatever it is, we'll face it together.

111
00:08:13,201 --> 00:08:15,551
You are quite charming, you know that?

112
00:08:15,552 --> 00:08:17,241
You haven't even seen my "a" game.

113
00:08:17,242 --> 00:08:19,413
Oh, lord, help me if that's true.

114
00:08:23,188 --> 00:08:25,175
It's Scott, by the way.

115
00:08:25,767 --> 00:08:28,137
You called me Haley James.

116
00:08:28,328 --> 00:08:30,737
Haley James Scott.

117
00:08:31,568 --> 00:08:33,348
And it always will be.

118
00:08:40,196 --> 00:08:42,107
Welcome back, students.

119
00:08:42,108 --> 00:08:45,644
Today as we return to our school with heavy hearts,

120
00:08:45,645 --> 00:08:47,620
you will note some changes.

121
00:08:47,621 --> 00:08:50,841
At the entrance to our schools, you will see metal detectors.

122
00:08:50,842 --> 00:08:52,669
They are here for your safety.

123
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:55,891
You  will see an armed police presence on campus.

124
00:08:55,892 --> 00:08:58,175
They are here for your well-being.

125
00:08:58,602 --> 00:09:01,079
We can try to make the school safer.

126
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,887
We can try to protect you.

127
00:09:02,888 --> 00:09:07,013
But there are no precautions that we can take to heal your hearts.

128
00:09:08,988 --> 00:09:10,051
Hey.

129
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:12,230
Hey.

130
00:09:13,395 --> 00:09:15,535
Let's just go to class, okay?

131
00:09:16,186 --> 00:09:17,238
Come on.

132
00:09:17,552 --> 00:09:19,253
I urge you to reach out 

133
00:09:19,254 --> 00:09:21,730
- to your teachers and counselors.
- Just give me one second.

134
00:09:21,843 --> 00:09:24,469
Form grief circles and talk about it.

135
00:09:25,104 --> 00:09:29,778
If you're feeling scared, if you're feeling vulnerable or confused,

136
00:09:29,779 --> 00:09:33,648
don't keep it inside. Let it out.

137
00:09:39,113 --> 00:09:41,078
You are not alone.

138
00:09:41,563 --> 00:09:43,654
And this is your school.

139
00:09:59,538 --> 00:10:00,935
Hey, roommate.

140
00:10:00,946 --> 00:10:02,370
Hey.

141
00:10:05,465 --> 00:10:08,483
This is the saddest thing. It's...

142
00:10:09,149 --> 00:10:12,019
the material for Karen's wedding dress.

143
00:10:13,052 --> 00:10:15,134
I ordered it the morning...

144
00:10:17,342 --> 00:10:19,753
Listen, I have some good news.

145
00:10:19,812 --> 00:10:20,858
Okay.

146
00:10:20,854 --> 00:10:24,471
Nathan and I want to be together again, like for real.

147
00:10:24,475 --> 00:10:25,901
Haley, that's awesome!

148
00:10:25,902 --> 00:10:28,488
Yeah, but it kind of sucks, though. I'm gonna miss you.

149
00:10:28,489 --> 00:10:30,084
You've become a really good friend.

150
00:10:30,085 --> 00:10:33,068
Yeah, you, too. When am I losing you?

151
00:10:33,069 --> 00:10:35,149
As soon as we can find an apartment, you know?

152
00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:36,766
- Okay. 
- Yeah.

153
00:10:36,767 --> 00:10:39,231
Whenever that is, you go, be happy.

154
00:10:40,057 --> 00:10:42,179
Life's too short, you know?

155
00:10:48,215 --> 00:10:50,936
Hey, kiddo. How'd you do at school?

156
00:10:50,937 --> 00:10:53,308
Fine. I'm just tired.

157
00:10:53,309 --> 00:10:57,728
Well, the doctor said that would happen, so just take it slow.

158
00:10:57,729 --> 00:10:58,723
Can I get you anything?

159
00:10:58,724 --> 00:11:00,260
Mnh-mnh. No, I'm fine.

160
00:11:00,642 --> 00:11:03,753
Okay, listen, uh, I cancelled my next run.

161
00:11:03,754 --> 00:11:07,884
Dad, you can't protect me every second of every day.

162
00:11:07,885 --> 00:11:09,814
Well, that sucks.

163
00:11:12,541 --> 00:11:15,111
I never want to feel the way I felt when I got that call

164
00:11:15,112 --> 00:11:17,968
saying my baby girl was on the way to the hospital.

165
00:11:19,623 --> 00:11:22,518
I got one other call like that in my life.

166
00:11:23,155 --> 00:11:24,957
That's two too many.

167
00:11:29,765 --> 00:11:31,733
How much allowance am I giving you, anyway?

168
00:11:31,734 --> 00:11:33,877
Ellie gave me those albums.

169
00:11:34,247 --> 00:11:37,088
I just can't bring myself to play them.

170
00:12:01,132 --> 00:12:02,251
Hey, Luke.

171
00:12:02,766 --> 00:12:04,079
Rachel.

172
00:12:04,622 --> 00:12:05,997
You  sent me this?

173
00:12:05,997 --> 00:12:07,075
Maybe.

174
00:12:09,942 --> 00:12:11,160
What are you doing?

175
00:12:13,774 --> 00:12:15,622
Nobody has all the answers.

176
00:12:16,047 --> 00:12:17,939
But we all have our "whys."

177
00:12:18,388 --> 00:12:21,180
Like, why did this happen?

178
00:12:21,186 --> 00:12:22,962
Why didn't we see it coming?

179
00:12:23,494 --> 00:12:25,490
Why do people watch "American Idol"?

180
00:12:25,932 --> 00:12:27,019
Come on.

181
00:12:34,368 --> 00:12:36,063
Welcome to detention.

182
00:12:47,312 --> 00:12:48,678
Hi, boyfriend.

183
00:12:48,731 --> 00:12:50,731
Do you really think a party's appropriate, Brooke?

184
00:12:50,732 --> 00:12:54,347
It's not a party. It's more of a cleansing for every kid in this school.

185
00:12:54,348 --> 00:12:56,395
Everybody's here. Everybody's invited.

186
00:12:56,396 --> 00:12:59,339
Everybody's together. So just check it out, okay?

187
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:02,768
We've got coed bathrooms, science lab for drugs and pharmaceuticals,

188
00:13:02,769 --> 00:13:05,583
health class for condoms and people probably using them.

189
00:13:05,584 --> 00:13:07,901
Spanish class has kick-ass margaritas.

190
00:13:07,902 --> 00:13:12,334
And there's the tutor center for anybody who needs a little extra help.

191
00:13:12,593 --> 00:13:14,958
Tonight we're all together, and we stop judging each other

192
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:17,365
and let everybody heal their own way.

193
00:13:21,452 --> 00:13:24,442
If you need to do this alone, I understand.

194
00:13:24,569 --> 00:13:26,623
But if you need me, I'm here.

195
00:13:37,467 --> 00:13:38,637
Hey.

196
00:13:38,971 --> 00:13:41,495
We should really stop meeting up like this.

197
00:13:43,219 --> 00:13:44,948
I never did thank you.

198
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:47,717
Hey, it's okay.

199
00:13:47,718 --> 00:13:50,042
God, I'm such a girl.

200
00:13:50,189 --> 00:13:51,815
You love me.

201
00:13:52,461 --> 00:13:54,653
Okay, that is so not fair.

202
00:13:54,654 --> 00:13:56,077
You probably just want to kiss me again.

203
00:13:56,078 --> 00:13:57,890
Dude, shut up.

204
00:13:58,217 --> 00:14:01,019
Okay, I kissed you, but I...

205
00:14:02,187 --> 00:14:03,790
I thought I was gonna die.

206
00:14:03,791 --> 00:14:07,366
And you took care of me, so, you know...

207
00:14:07,367 --> 00:14:10,250
Yeah. I know.

208
00:14:12,608 --> 00:14:14,636
If I told you I loved you, would you hold it against me?

209
00:14:14,637 --> 00:14:16,706
Luke, when I said that...

210
00:14:19,326 --> 00:14:22,537
Because I do, Peyton.

211
00:14:23,158 --> 00:14:26,157
But it's okay, because, um...

212
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:30,579
there is this other girl -- I mean, you might know her.

213
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:35,097
Her name's Brooke Davis. And I am completely in love with her.

214
00:14:35,098 --> 00:14:38,599
You don't know how good it is to hear you say that.

215
00:14:39,097 --> 00:14:41,660
'Cause I thought everything was gonna get weird again,

216
00:14:41,661 --> 00:14:44,026
and I really don't want it to.

217
00:14:46,261 --> 00:14:49,374
We're okay, right, you and me? We're good?

218
00:14:51,088 --> 00:14:54,667
All right. I should go.

219
00:14:56,681 --> 00:14:57,890
Peyton?

220
00:14:58,679 --> 00:15:02,634
I'm sorry about your mom -- both moms.

221
00:15:02,687 --> 00:15:06,638
I don't feel like I've been there for you the way I should have,

222
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:08,950
and I'm just sorry for that.

223
00:15:09,105 --> 00:15:12,227
You know how proud Keith must be of you right now?

224
00:15:12,488 --> 00:15:13,906
I don't know if that's true.

225
00:15:13,907 --> 00:15:15,178
It is.

226
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:18,809
Let Brooke help you out with this, okay?

227
00:15:18,810 --> 00:15:19,930
Don't shut her out.

228
00:15:19,931 --> 00:15:21,106
Why,  did she say something to you?

229
00:15:21,107 --> 00:15:24,026
No. I just -- I know how you are.

230
00:15:24,027 --> 00:15:25,711
I'm the same way.

231
00:15:26,883 --> 00:15:30,265
She gave you her heart, Luke. You should give yours back.

232
00:15:32,146 --> 00:15:33,588
I'll see you.

233
00:15:34,189 --> 00:15:36,307
Hey, don't kiss anybody out there.

234
00:15:37,607 --> 00:15:39,584
You suck, you know that?

235
00:15:49,485 --> 00:15:50,537
Hey.

236
00:15:51,013 --> 00:15:52,654
Want to come dance with me?

237
00:15:53,036 --> 00:15:56,354
Everybody head to lockdown! I've got a shooter here.

238
00:15:56,355 --> 00:15:59,427
Shooters in the hallway. Come on, everybody.

239
00:16:02,252 --> 00:16:05,494
Pull your head out of your ass and show some respect.

240
00:16:14,328 --> 00:16:15,662
Lucas!

241
00:16:16,143 --> 00:16:17,664
Please stay.

242
00:16:17,675 --> 00:16:21,008
I can't, Brooke. It's not right.

243
00:16:21,009 --> 00:16:22,216
Why not?

244
00:16:22,217 --> 00:16:24,249
You wouldn't understand. You weren't there.

245
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:28,425
I may not have been inside that school, but that doesn't mean that I wasn't there.

246
00:16:28,426 --> 00:16:32,273
It doesn't mean that I don't carry that day around with me like everybody else.

247
00:16:32,274 --> 00:16:33,233
I was there.

248
00:16:33,234 --> 00:16:35,355
And if a party helps to bring us all together

249
00:16:35,356 --> 00:16:37,722
and helps everyone to deal with it, then why not?

250
00:16:37,723 --> 00:16:42,748
Rachel, you know that this is wrong. Somebody died in that hallway.

251
00:16:42,749 --> 00:16:45,974
No, Luke. Two people died.

252
00:16:50,743 --> 00:16:52,519
I'm sorry, Brooke.

253
00:16:52,671 --> 00:16:56,661
I know you're trying to help me with this, and I love you for it, but I...

254
00:16:59,198 --> 00:17:01,014
I just -- I can't.

255
00:17:21,724 --> 00:17:23,230
What's up, my brother?

256
00:17:24,627 --> 00:17:25,649
Nothing.

257
00:17:28,002 --> 00:17:31,650
So, listen, the guys talked and decided...

258
00:17:31,758 --> 00:17:34,043
we're not gonna go to Jimmy's funeral tomorrow.

259
00:17:34,578 --> 00:17:39,503
I  mean, Mouth's kind of tore up about it, but we all loved Keith.

260
00:17:39,582 --> 00:17:41,470
It just don't seem right.

261
00:17:45,319 --> 00:17:47,305
Do you think there's a heaven, Skills?

262
00:17:48,545 --> 00:17:50,379
Do I think there's a heaven?

263
00:17:50,938 --> 00:17:55,711
Yeah, you know, like the pearly gates, angels.

264
00:17:57,068 --> 00:17:58,988
I don't know about all that.

265
00:17:59,334 --> 00:18:03,190
Maybe some chrome gates and some freaky angels.

266
00:18:06,108 --> 00:18:10,404
No. But I do think there's something else out there.

267
00:18:10,867 --> 00:18:17,402
And I do think that whatever we do in this world matters in the next.

268
00:18:18,866 --> 00:18:22,118
Before you came in, I was thinking about Edwards...

269
00:18:24,181 --> 00:18:27,328
how he could take Keith's life.

270
00:18:27,329 --> 00:18:29,393
Look, he wasn't right, dog.

271
00:18:29,947 --> 00:18:31,242
Jimmy was sick.

272
00:18:31,243 --> 00:18:36,061
So if that's true, is heaven the kind of place that will hold that against someone?

273
00:18:36,062 --> 00:18:37,684
Because if not,

274
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:40,936
Jimmy's a victim, too.

275
00:18:41,407 --> 00:18:45,309
And right now in your world beyond this one,

276
00:18:45,310 --> 00:18:48,193
Jimmy and Keith are in the same place.

277
00:18:49,974 --> 00:18:52,647
I can't figure out what kind of place that would be.

278
00:18:52,648 --> 00:18:55,026
It's a place you and I wouldn't understand.

279
00:18:55,494 --> 00:18:57,638
Or a place that doesn't exist.

280
00:19:00,669 --> 00:19:02,393
Oh, I love this song.

281
00:19:07,228 --> 00:19:09,327
You think that's okay?

282
00:19:09,593 --> 00:19:14,233
To, like, love a song and feel good when you hear it

283
00:19:14,234 --> 00:19:18,049
and, like, laugh and be happy

284
00:19:19,107 --> 00:19:22,213
and be so in love with somebody your heart aches?

285
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:29,174
I mean, is that okay right now, or is it just too soon?

286
00:19:29,554 --> 00:19:33,234
It's never, never too soon to feel like that.

287
00:19:47,676 --> 00:19:49,470
Danny.

288
00:19:53,114 --> 00:19:55,292
Danny, I'm waiting.

289
00:19:56,058 --> 00:19:58,130
Why'd you do this to me?

290
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:28,728
I saw the light.

291
00:20:28,729 --> 00:20:30,063
I doubt it.

292
00:20:33,271 --> 00:20:35,280
Truth be told, I couldn't sleep.

293
00:20:37,181 --> 00:20:38,224
Can I help you?

294
00:20:38,225 --> 00:20:41,707
No, Dan. You can't help me.

295
00:20:44,099 --> 00:20:46,383
You were horrible to Keith.

296
00:20:47,287 --> 00:20:49,773
Is it any wonder you can't sleep?

297
00:20:49,813 --> 00:20:51,009
Doesn't mean I didn't love him.

298
00:20:51,010 --> 00:20:52,601
Well, that's great, Dan.

299
00:20:52,779 --> 00:20:55,687
But how's it feel to know you can never take any of it back?

300
00:20:55,688 --> 00:20:58,679
And for the rest of your life, all you'll have is regret

301
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:03,100
over a relationship you could have repaired with a few kind words.

302
00:21:03,148 --> 00:21:06,344
But you couldn't even find it in your heart to do it.

303
00:21:06,649 --> 00:21:08,679
Maybe I'll find those words with Lucas.

304
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:12,326
No. Don't push me, Dan.

305
00:21:12,327 --> 00:21:15,796
Come on, Karen. He's old enough to make his own decisions.

306
00:21:15,797 --> 00:21:18,083
Like when he went back into that school,

307
00:21:18,085 --> 00:21:20,806
or when he pulled me out of the dealership fire.

308
00:21:32,008 --> 00:21:34,228
Did you pull Dan out of the fire?

309
00:21:35,665 --> 00:21:36,471
Mom --

310
00:21:36,472 --> 00:21:37,677
Did you?

311
00:21:40,131 --> 00:21:41,532
Yes.

312
00:21:43,179 --> 00:21:47,460
You selfish, stupid boy.

313
00:21:47,518 --> 00:21:49,490
Did you think about me?

314
00:21:49,491 --> 00:21:54,710
Just once think about me and what my life would be like if I lost you?

315
00:21:54,711 --> 00:21:58,233
Running into burning buildings, high schools with guns --

316
00:21:58,234 --> 00:22:00,035
did I raise an idiot?

317
00:22:00,036 --> 00:22:03,087
I know! Okay? I know! It's my fault!

318
00:22:03,088 --> 00:22:06,454
If I didn't go back in there, Keith would still be here.

319
00:22:06,537 --> 00:22:08,265
And I know that.

320
00:22:10,704 --> 00:22:12,123
And I'm sorry.

321
00:22:15,790 --> 00:22:20,872
Well, sorry isn't gonna bring him back, is it?

322
00:22:49,313 --> 00:22:51,169
You have to let it go, Mouth.

323
00:22:51,752 --> 00:22:53,387
It's not your fault.

324
00:22:54,333 --> 00:22:56,076
I wasn't thinking that.

325
00:22:56,987 --> 00:22:58,506
Yes, you were.

326
00:22:59,382 --> 00:23:02,033
You have this ridiculous notion that, because you were friends once,

327
00:23:02,034 --> 00:23:03,692
you could have saved him.

328
00:23:03,921 --> 00:23:06,095
What's so ridiculous about that?

329
00:23:07,077 --> 00:23:08,416
Because you couldn't have.

330
00:23:08,417 --> 00:23:10,373
I was his best friend, Rachel.

331
00:23:10,374 --> 00:23:12,999
How many times did the guy call you in the last year?

332
00:23:13,635 --> 00:23:15,443
Come on, look around.

333
00:23:15,503 --> 00:23:17,403
Everybody's here tonight.

334
00:23:17,404 --> 00:23:20,332
Geeks, stoners, jocks,

335
00:23:20,333 --> 00:23:23,461
maybe a few old friends who forgot to stay in touch.

336
00:23:24,197 --> 00:23:25,854
That's how it's gonna change.

337
00:23:25,855 --> 00:23:27,910
But everyone's still divided.

338
00:23:29,012 --> 00:23:33,207
We stick to these rigid circles of friends based on sports we play

339
00:23:33,208 --> 00:23:37,147
or hobbies we like or how attractive or unattractive we are.

340
00:23:37,425 --> 00:23:39,466
When's that gonna change?

341
00:23:39,467 --> 00:23:40,825
H onestly?

342
00:23:41,337 --> 00:23:42,747
Probably never.

343
00:23:43,591 --> 00:23:47,376
Look, that's human nature. People stick to their own kind.

344
00:23:47,377 --> 00:23:50,028
If you want it to change, then change it.

345
00:23:50,288 --> 00:23:51,649
I'll help you.

346
00:23:52,284 --> 00:23:53,660
How?

347
00:23:55,725 --> 00:23:57,082
Dance with me.

348
00:24:12,828 --> 00:24:13,856
Hey.

349
00:24:14,052 --> 00:24:15,112
Hey.

350
00:24:19,234 --> 00:24:20,330
Here.

351
00:24:20,868 --> 00:24:22,539
What is this?

352
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:23,765
It's my door key.

353
00:24:23,766 --> 00:24:25,595
Actually it's your door key.

354
00:24:25,636 --> 00:24:27,756
- Brooke, it's your place.
- No.

355
00:24:27,757 --> 00:24:30,724
It's always been your place, both of yours.

356
00:24:31,014 --> 00:24:33,676
I was just keeping it warm till you came to your senses.

357
00:24:33,677 --> 00:24:34,748
Thank you, Brooke.

358
00:24:34,749 --> 00:24:35,916
Thanks.

359
00:24:36,946 --> 00:24:38,535
How's Lucas doing?

360
00:24:39,228 --> 00:24:40,966
I don't know. He left.

361
00:24:41,104 --> 00:24:44,170
Just trying to give him his space, but it's hard, you know?

362
00:24:44,806 --> 00:24:47,281
Anyway, you kids be happy.

363
00:24:47,282 --> 00:24:50,420
One of these days, you'll make the rest of us believe in true love.

364
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:55,146
I want to go find Lucas.

365
00:24:55,389 --> 00:24:56,930
Okay, let's go.

366
00:24:57,627 --> 00:24:58,683
Okay.

367
00:25:01,647 --> 00:25:02,899
Hey, hold on.

368
00:26:28,462 --> 00:26:30,137
Why did you do that?

369
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:37,679
Because I don't think you're gonna like me 10 seconds from now.

370
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:38,703
But --

371
00:26:38,704 --> 00:26:40,740
I released the time capsule.

372
00:26:41,410 --> 00:26:43,549
It's not your fault, Mouth.

373
00:26:44,327 --> 00:26:45,662
It's mine.

374
00:26:52,503 --> 00:26:53,804
You're right.

375
00:26:55,518 --> 00:26:57,164
I don't like you.

376
00:27:19,329 --> 00:27:20,370
Hey.

377
00:27:23,143 --> 00:27:24,167
Here.

378
00:27:26,394 --> 00:27:28,729
I'm taking my predictions back.

379
00:27:29,318 --> 00:27:32,423
They're not gonna come true now, anyway, not without Keith.

380
00:27:32,902 --> 00:27:33,976
Luke.

381
00:27:34,152 --> 00:27:38,571
My mom thinks that this was my fault.

382
00:27:38,572 --> 00:27:39,927
She would not say that.

383
00:27:39,928 --> 00:27:41,680
Yeah, she pretty much did.

384
00:27:42,925 --> 00:27:44,866
We shouldn't have gone back into that school.

385
00:27:44,867 --> 00:27:46,344
She's wrong.

386
00:27:46,403 --> 00:27:49,059
Luke, Keith would have gone back into that school

387
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:52,806
if you were in there or not because that is who he was.

388
00:27:53,282 --> 00:27:55,278
This is not your fault.

389
00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:57,652
She's right, Luke. You did what he did.

390
00:27:57,653 --> 00:27:59,981
You went back in there to save a life.

391
00:27:59,982 --> 00:28:01,866
Otherwise we might have been at Peyton's funeral.

392
00:28:01,867 --> 00:28:03,489
But I couldn't save Keith.

393
00:28:03,490 --> 00:28:04,923
Neither could I.

394
00:28:04,924 --> 00:28:08,225
He loved you a lot, Luke, just like we do.

395
00:28:09,219 --> 00:28:10,905
And so does Brooke.

396
00:28:11,523 --> 00:28:13,623
You think none of your predictions are gonna come true?

397
00:28:13,624 --> 00:28:15,632
Look at the first one on your list.

398
00:28:15,633 --> 00:28:19,009
"This year I'll try again with Brooke."

399
00:28:25,705 --> 00:28:26,980
Brooke?

400
00:28:28,496 --> 00:28:29,506
Brooke!

401
00:28:29,507 --> 00:28:30,828
She's gone.

402
00:28:32,850 --> 00:28:35,477
Coach, I can explain it all.

403
00:28:35,478 --> 00:28:41,180
It wouldn't matter, seeing as how I'm not here right now.

404
00:28:43,169 --> 00:28:45,906
Not that I approve of any of this, but...

405
00:28:45,977 --> 00:28:52,835
I guess kids getting drunk in school beats kids getting killed.

406
00:28:57,238 --> 00:28:59,124
Been meaning to talk to you.

407
00:28:59,664 --> 00:29:02,631
The truth of the matter is I've been busy...

408
00:29:02,908 --> 00:29:05,161
crying like a baby.

409
00:29:05,621 --> 00:29:07,589
They were gonna get married.

410
00:29:08,826 --> 00:29:10,612
Keith was gonna be my dad.

411
00:29:10,613 --> 00:29:12,497
He was your dad.

412
00:29:12,499 --> 00:29:15,605
No matter what any science or papers said.

413
00:29:15,606 --> 00:29:19,924
He was the man who influenced your life more than anybody else.

414
00:29:19,925 --> 00:29:22,281
I saw it in you every day.

415
00:29:22,610 --> 00:29:24,523
I just want him to come back.

416
00:29:25,330 --> 00:29:27,167
I just want him to come home.

417
00:29:28,468 --> 00:29:29,832
It's not fair.

418
00:29:31,501 --> 00:29:33,623
I'm gonna tell you something.

419
00:29:34,742 --> 00:29:39,232
When my wife... died,

420
00:29:39,690 --> 00:29:44,735
things got pretty dark there for a while.

421
00:29:44,825 --> 00:29:47,142
Nobody could talk to me.

422
00:29:48,203 --> 00:29:51,820
And then one of my former players --

423
00:29:52,517 --> 00:29:56,303
kid may have been the worst player I ever coached --

424
00:29:58,133 --> 00:30:00,638
waded into that darkness

425
00:30:01,504 --> 00:30:04,124
and pulled me to safety.

426
00:30:05,837 --> 00:30:10,329
Kid's name was Keith Scott.

427
00:30:13,851 --> 00:30:21,186
He said, "coach, I know you want some answers.

428
00:30:21,187 --> 00:30:23,524
But what is the right answer?

429
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:26,623
Because there is no answer.

430
00:30:26,782 --> 00:30:28,775
There's just life."

431
00:30:29,173 --> 00:30:32,373
Just life.

432
00:30:33,829 --> 00:30:38,921
Lucas, be the man that Keith taught you to be.

433
00:30:39,153 --> 00:30:43,846
Anything less will make this a much greater tragedy than it already is.

434
00:30:56,316 --> 00:30:58,341
Danny.

435
00:31:00,891 --> 00:31:03,041
Why'd you do this to me?

436
00:31:04,993 --> 00:31:06,853
It's not gonna work, you know.

437
00:31:08,169 --> 00:31:10,735
I'm not gonna carry this around with me.

438
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,899
I did what I did, and it's done.

439
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:14,517
Danny.

440
00:31:14,518 --> 00:31:17,363
So you come around all you want, ghost. You won't scare me.

441
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:24,665
As a matter of fact, tonight I'm gonna sleep like a baby. You want to know why?

442
00:31:26,747 --> 00:31:29,168
Because you started this war.

443
00:31:30,018 --> 00:31:31,796
I just finished it.

444
00:31:33,829 --> 00:31:35,533
I just finished it.

445
00:32:04,395 --> 00:32:07,200
This is Karen's wedding dress material.

446
00:32:11,001 --> 00:32:12,923
If only it were raining.

447
00:32:13,215 --> 00:32:14,821
I think I can take care of that.

448
00:32:16,188 --> 00:32:17,332
Come on.

449
00:32:23,993 --> 00:32:25,014
Hey.

450
00:32:25,015 --> 00:32:28,142
Do you know a Pete from "Freak Out Boy,"

451
00:32:28,143 --> 00:32:31,323
tattoos, goofy grin, about as tall as a fire hydrant?

452
00:32:31,324 --> 00:32:33,526
- Fall Out Boy.
- Yeah, whatever.

453
00:32:33,527 --> 00:32:36,807
I can't believe I'm about to say this to my high school-aged daughter,

454
00:32:36,808 --> 00:32:40,718
but he is waiting in that limo.

455
00:32:41,377 --> 00:32:44,776
Don't be long.

456
00:32:44,777 --> 00:32:46,029
Okay.

457
00:33:18,192 --> 00:33:19,795
I want you to know something.

458
00:33:21,016 --> 00:33:23,155
If anything ever happens to me,

459
00:33:23,156 --> 00:33:25,885
- if you ever lose me --
- Nathan.

460
00:33:25,886 --> 00:33:28,294
I want you to know how happy you made me,

461
00:33:29,054 --> 00:33:32,358
how wonderful my life was with you and...

462
00:33:32,799 --> 00:33:34,888
I will always be with you.

463
00:33:36,375 --> 00:33:38,130
Nothing's gonna happen to you.

464
00:33:38,131 --> 00:33:39,420
I know.

465
00:33:39,517 --> 00:33:44,179
I know. You're right. But if it does, I just --

466
00:33:44,367 --> 00:33:46,596
I want you to be okay, Haley,

467
00:33:47,067 --> 00:33:50,068
and know that you made me happy.

468
00:33:59,633 --> 00:34:01,101
You wanted rain.

469
00:34:04,556 --> 00:34:07,495
It is not possible to be this in love.

470
00:34:26,243 --> 00:34:27,805
Hey, pretty girl.

471
00:34:28,599 --> 00:34:29,834
Hey.

472
00:34:29,996 --> 00:34:32,633
I was gonna sleep in my car, but I heard a noise,

473
00:34:32,634 --> 00:34:34,901
and I think it was a bear or something.

474
00:34:34,902 --> 00:34:36,543
Well, where were you parked?

475
00:34:36,544 --> 00:34:38,993
Right outside here.

476
00:34:40,668 --> 00:34:45,302
Well, have I told you how much I love you today?

477
00:34:46,103 --> 00:34:47,577
Not really.

478
00:34:47,633 --> 00:34:49,206
Well, I do,

479
00:34:49,911 --> 00:34:53,957
and even when I don't tell you, it means a lot to me to know you're there.

480
00:34:54,133 --> 00:34:56,905
It means everything.

481
00:34:57,585 --> 00:34:59,526
I am here.

482
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:01,758
We both are.

483
00:35:01,759 --> 00:35:03,106
I know.

484
00:35:03,288 --> 00:35:04,962
It's good being here...

485
00:35:06,078 --> 00:35:08,042
especially with you.

486
00:35:10,833 --> 00:35:12,819
I wished that it was me.

487
00:35:15,523 --> 00:35:19,213
I know that's horrible, and I know that's selfish, but...

488
00:35:20,296 --> 00:35:24,474
I watched you rescued Peyton, and you told me you rescued Dan.

489
00:35:24,475 --> 00:35:26,758
And sometimes I just wish you could rescue me.

490
00:35:26,759 --> 00:35:28,008
From what?

491
00:35:28,545 --> 00:35:30,084
From all of it.

492
00:35:31,217 --> 00:35:32,443
Okay, then.

493
00:35:33,810 --> 00:35:35,022
I will.

494
00:35:36,801 --> 00:35:40,459
If you promise to rescue me back.

495
00:35:41,383 --> 00:35:42,731
I promise.

496
00:35:49,924 --> 00:35:52,126
There's something else I need to do.

497
00:35:59,511 --> 00:36:01,506
- Hey, buddy.
- Hey.

498
00:36:02,426 --> 00:36:03,850
How's the leg?

499
00:36:03,851 --> 00:36:06,541
Oh, it'll be okay.

500
00:36:06,542 --> 00:36:08,055
How's the boy?

501
00:36:08,368 --> 00:36:10,002
It'll be okay.

502
00:36:10,348 --> 00:36:12,694
- Oh --
- I'm sorry, Peyton.

503
00:36:12,798 --> 00:36:13,951
Why?

504
00:36:15,004 --> 00:36:16,914
Because I shouldn't have left you there.

505
00:36:16,915 --> 00:36:18,520
I thought you were behind me.

506
00:36:18,521 --> 00:36:21,535
- Brooke, don't --
- No. I should have made sure.

507
00:36:21,536 --> 00:36:25,012
Okay. You're my best friend.

508
00:36:25,013 --> 00:36:29,998
And you want to know what made me feel better when I was trapped in that library?

509
00:36:29,999 --> 00:36:31,781
It was knowing that Brooke's okay, you know?

510
00:36:31,782 --> 00:36:33,957
My best friend, she's safe.

511
00:36:34,643 --> 00:36:37,200
I love you for that, P. Sawyer.

512
00:36:38,043 --> 00:36:42,096
But there was something else that made you feel better in that library --

513
00:36:42,309 --> 00:36:44,057
my boyfriend.

514
00:36:44,847 --> 00:36:47,261
And I guess I can't hold it against him, can I?

515
00:36:47,262 --> 00:36:51,758
I mean, the boy I love protected the girl I love.

516
00:36:52,802 --> 00:36:55,161
- And it's the girl that he loves, too.
- Brooke --

517
00:36:55,162 --> 00:36:57,400
No. We both know it's true.

518
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:01,095
Okay.

519
00:37:03,169 --> 00:37:05,492
- What --
- come here. No. Come here.

520
00:37:05,965 --> 00:37:09,408
All right. I want you to listen to me.

521
00:37:10,214 --> 00:37:13,980
I care about Lucas, and I always will.

522
00:37:14,669 --> 00:37:17,810
But he's insanely in love with you.

523
00:37:18,206 --> 00:37:20,420
And you know what? So am I.

524
00:37:20,435 --> 00:37:22,043
You're my Brooke.

525
00:37:23,180 --> 00:37:25,262
I'm not gonna hurt you again.

526
00:37:26,549 --> 00:37:29,384
Okay, 'cause I really don't want to hurt again.

527
00:37:29,622 --> 00:37:30,901
Come here. 

528
00:37:32,662 --> 00:37:34,601
You're something, you know that?

529
00:37:35,170 --> 00:37:37,972
I get shot, and you're the one that needs consoling.

530
00:37:37,973 --> 00:37:39,493
Sorry.

531
00:37:41,075 --> 00:37:42,243
You want a lift?

532
00:37:42,588 --> 00:37:44,529
Yes. I do.

533
00:37:44,654 --> 00:37:46,428
- Okay.
- Hold on.

534
00:37:48,001 --> 00:37:49,977
Oh! Please don't fall!

535
00:37:49,978 --> 00:37:51,236
Ow!

536
00:37:52,258 --> 00:37:54,037
- Come on.
- No, I got you.

537
00:37:54,038 --> 00:37:56,297
- Am I that heavy?
- No! I got you. I got you.

538
00:37:56,298 --> 00:37:57,229
Go.

539
00:38:01,108 --> 00:38:02,939
Okay, ow. Ow.

540
00:38:03,019 --> 00:38:04,249
Oh, boy.

541
00:38:06,243 --> 00:38:07,213
What?

542
00:38:07,214 --> 00:38:08,408
Dad?

543
00:38:09,046 --> 00:38:10,414
What did you do?

544
00:38:10,415 --> 00:38:13,576
I know your room's like some holy land forbidden to fathers,

545
00:38:13,577 --> 00:38:15,657
but I thought I'd make you some shelves.

546
00:38:15,946 --> 00:38:17,491
You know, sweetie...

547
00:38:18,469 --> 00:38:22,792
people will things that have given them great happiness in their life,

548
00:38:22,793 --> 00:38:26,233
things that have helped them make sense of the world.

549
00:38:26,234 --> 00:38:29,406
I'm sure that Ellie hoped that when you played these albums

550
00:38:29,407 --> 00:38:33,642
that you would remember her and she would be with you in the music.

551
00:38:33,730 --> 00:38:35,234
Thank you.

552
00:38:36,482 --> 00:38:38,378
But where's my bed?

553
00:38:38,486 --> 00:38:40,700
I don't think you have room for a queen-sized bed.

554
00:38:40,701 --> 00:38:44,011
I'm bringing two singles in here now that Brooke's moving in.

555
00:38:44,012 --> 00:38:45,220
What?

556
00:38:45,635 --> 00:38:46,847
Really?

557
00:38:46,916 --> 00:38:50,076
Best friends should stick together. Welcome home.

558
00:38:53,082 --> 00:38:55,804
This is gonna be amazing. I have to teach you the scrunchie system.

559
00:38:55,805 --> 00:38:59,090
No, no, no, no, no. No nudity in our room, okay?

560
00:38:59,091 --> 00:39:04,131
But, oh! Speaking of boys, tonight after the party,

561
00:39:04,184 --> 00:39:07,605
I hooked up with Pete from Fall Out Boy -- we made out.

562
00:39:07,606 --> 00:39:10,055
Oh, Peyton, we're gonna find you a boyfriend, honey.

563
00:39:10,056 --> 00:39:11,391
You don't have to lie about it.

564
00:39:11,392 --> 00:39:11,947
No, I --

565
00:39:11,948 --> 00:39:13,957
Now, how do you feel about a round bed?

566
00:39:14,798 --> 00:39:16,968
Whatever you say, roommate.

567
00:39:31,882 --> 00:39:33,491
Hey, ma, you okay?

568
00:39:36,597 --> 00:39:38,181
What are you doing?

569
00:39:41,158 --> 00:39:43,485
It's what Keith would have wanted.

570
00:39:43,679 --> 00:39:46,857
Absolutely not. You go to your room, and you change.

571
00:39:50,784 --> 00:39:51,816
No.

572
00:39:52,505 --> 00:39:54,477
I said go change.

573
00:40:00,987 --> 00:40:02,734
It's what Keith would want.

574
00:41:15,652 --> 00:41:19,477
