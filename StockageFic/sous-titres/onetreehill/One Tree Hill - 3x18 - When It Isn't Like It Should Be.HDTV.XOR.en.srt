1
00:00:00,344 --> 00:00:01,877
Previously on "One Tree Hill"...

2
00:00:01,878 --> 00:00:02,793
Marry me.

3
00:00:02,794 --> 00:00:03,982
We're engaged.

4
00:00:03,983 --> 00:00:07,123
Me and your mom talked it over. I'd like to adopt you.

5
00:00:08,338 --> 00:00:10,529
I want to be your husband again, Haley.

6
00:00:11,087 --> 00:00:15,434
In 1955, students at Tree Hill High School

7
00:00:15,435 --> 00:00:19,305
created a time capsule that was to be opened in 50 years.

8
00:00:19,306 --> 00:00:21,933
You want to know what things were like 50 years ago.

9
00:00:21,934 --> 00:00:25,337
There's not a single person in this place worth remembering.

10
00:00:25,336 --> 00:00:27,712
Everyone here is a loser.

11
00:00:29,992 --> 00:00:31,816
Now, I may have to get you out of here,

12
00:00:31,817 --> 00:00:33,546
but nothing will happen to you.

13
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:34,732
I promise.

14
00:00:34,738 --> 00:00:36,543
You got to let me try to talk to him.

15
00:00:36,546 --> 00:00:37,673
Luke...

16
00:00:39,358 --> 00:00:41,161
I love you. Now go.

17
00:00:41,257 --> 00:00:43,292
I wanted them to like me.

18
00:00:44,748 --> 00:00:45,923
Jimmy, please --

19
00:00:45,925 --> 00:00:47,030
I'm sorry.

20
00:00:47,068 --> 00:00:48,103
No!

21
00:00:48,116 --> 00:00:49,510
He's gone, Danny.

22
00:00:53,688 --> 00:00:55,582
I released the time capsule.

23
00:00:55,886 --> 00:00:57,362
I don't like you.

24
00:01:53,326 --> 00:01:55,242
Hey, Luke, we got to go.

25
00:02:00,387 --> 00:02:02,712
So, mom, I'm gonna take off, okay?

26
00:02:05,126 --> 00:02:06,092
Hello?

27
00:02:15,348 --> 00:02:18,013
Well, I'll be on my cell if you need anything.

28
00:02:19,238 --> 00:02:21,050
Don't take it personally.

29
00:02:21,285 --> 00:02:23,000
She's been through a lot.

30
00:02:23,328 --> 00:02:25,892
I know, but she just seems so hopeless.

31
00:02:25,948 --> 00:02:28,783
Yeah, we're all gonna get our hope back, Luke.

32
00:02:28,816 --> 00:02:31,641
It's just gonna take some of us longer than others, you know?

33
00:02:31,647 --> 00:02:33,040
Henry James wrote,

34
00:02:33,047 --> 00:02:34,891
"Be not afraid of life.

35
00:02:34,895 --> 00:02:37,223
Believe that life is worth living,

36
00:02:37,227 --> 00:02:40,362
and your belief will help create the fact."

37
00:02:43,825 --> 00:02:45,922
I have a feeling this is gonna be a great weekend.

38
00:02:45,926 --> 00:02:47,923
Yeah, it will be nice to get away.

39
00:02:47,926 --> 00:02:51,190
Hopefully to get everybody to stop talking about you-know-what.

40
00:02:52,097 --> 00:02:54,920
Hey, does anybody know anything about this place we're going to?

41
00:02:54,927 --> 00:02:57,233
All Rachel said is that it's some kind of cabin.

42
00:02:57,436 --> 00:03:00,353
Does Rachel really have to come? Can't we just leave her?

43
00:03:00,356 --> 00:03:02,652
Uh, considering it's her family's place,

44
00:03:02,655 --> 00:03:04,173
I don't really think we have an option.

45
00:03:04,178 --> 00:03:06,402
I'm just saying think about it.

46
00:03:06,948 --> 00:03:08,333
Hey, party people.

47
00:03:08,335 --> 00:03:10,881
Hey, baby, you ready to conquer the great outdoors?

48
00:03:10,885 --> 00:03:12,042
If you say so.

49
00:03:12,046 --> 00:03:12,911
Skills.

50
00:03:12,916 --> 00:03:14,442
That didn't sound very enthusiastic.

51
00:03:14,446 --> 00:03:16,202
Yeah, Skills isn't really the outdoor type.

52
00:03:16,206 --> 00:03:18,962
That's okay, Pete isn't either, and he's gonna try to meet us there.

53
00:03:18,966 --> 00:03:19,742
Who's Pete?

54
00:03:19,748 --> 00:03:20,710
Fall Out Boy?

55
00:03:20,718 --> 00:03:22,520
He's Peyton's imaginary friend.

56
00:03:22,528 --> 00:03:24,813
Brooke, he's not imaginary. You saw us together at the concert.

57
00:03:24,817 --> 00:03:27,150
And now he loves you.

58
00:03:27,156 --> 00:03:29,622
Wasn't it nice of Pete to put your bag in the car?

59
00:03:31,368 --> 00:03:32,703
You guys, he's coming.

60
00:03:32,707 --> 00:03:35,120
You know what? Kanye rolling through, too.

61
00:03:39,207 --> 00:03:42,860
Skills, we are only gonna be gone for two nights. What is in that thing?

62
00:03:42,865 --> 00:03:46,552
Look baby, if gonna be in the middle of the woods, I need all my stuff --

63
00:03:46,556 --> 00:03:49,413
cd, dvd, mp3, my pillow.

64
00:03:49,417 --> 00:03:52,533
Wait, but you know we're not staying in the woods. There's a cabin.

65
00:03:52,537 --> 00:03:54,000
Think less rustic.

66
00:03:54,237 --> 00:03:55,830
How much less rustic?

67
00:04:05,717 --> 00:04:07,900
Now, this is my kind of roughing it.

68
00:04:08,378 --> 00:04:09,582
I thought you might like it.

69
00:04:09,585 --> 00:04:10,910
Come on.

70
00:04:16,957 --> 00:04:18,833
Rachel, this place is awesome.

71
00:04:18,837 --> 00:04:20,952
It's been in my family for years. We hardly come here anymore.

72
00:04:20,955 --> 00:04:23,072
My dad mostly loans it out to clients.

73
00:04:23,078 --> 00:04:24,433
Uh, the kitchen's fully loaded.

74
00:04:24,437 --> 00:04:26,612
There's a river for fishing, a TV's in the garage,

75
00:04:26,618 --> 00:04:28,771
plasma screen upstairs, and a hot tub in the back.

76
00:04:28,778 --> 00:04:31,311
There's five bedrooms. Take any one but the master.

77
00:04:31,315 --> 00:04:32,481
Let's check them out.

78
00:04:42,127 --> 00:04:44,020
Man, this is nice.

79
00:04:44,348 --> 00:04:46,981
What does Rachel's dad do for a living anyway?

80
00:04:47,067 --> 00:04:48,363
I don't know.

81
00:04:48,476 --> 00:04:50,733
Maybe he's like Tony Soprano.

82
00:04:50,738 --> 00:04:53,003
The would explain her personality.

83
00:04:53,476 --> 00:04:56,000
Look, Rachel did a very nice thing by inviting us here.

84
00:04:56,005 --> 00:04:58,552
Maybe  this would be a good weekend to take it easy on her.

85
00:04:58,566 --> 00:05:01,500
But isn't the point of this weekend for us to get back to normal?

86
00:05:01,505 --> 00:05:03,593
If Rachel and I aren't back at each other's throats,

87
00:05:03,595 --> 00:05:05,590
it's like the terrorists have won.

88
00:05:08,297 --> 00:05:09,440
Look at you.

89
00:05:09,445 --> 00:05:10,192
What?

90
00:05:10,197 --> 00:05:11,502
Your smile.

91
00:05:11,698 --> 00:05:13,132
I've missed it.

92
00:05:16,535 --> 00:05:18,612
Here's something to make you smile.

93
00:05:19,195 --> 00:05:20,251
My latest letter.

94
00:05:20,256 --> 00:05:22,490
Ooh! Yay, more mail.

95
00:05:22,498 --> 00:05:25,301
This one I really think you're gonna like.

96
00:05:25,318 --> 00:05:29,190
Oh. This weekend is so gonna pay off for you.

97
00:05:35,537 --> 00:05:37,183
You better grab a bed.

98
00:05:37,498 --> 00:05:39,310
The good ones are going fast.

99
00:05:39,338 --> 00:05:41,110
The couch is fine with me.

100
00:05:41,325 --> 00:05:43,060
Mouth, don't be stupid.

101
00:05:43,995 --> 00:05:45,991
Tell you what -- why don't you just bunk with me?

102
00:05:45,998 --> 00:05:47,912
Like I said, I'm good.

103
00:05:50,686 --> 00:05:52,332
So that's how it's gonna be.

104
00:05:52,838 --> 00:05:55,202
You don't think I know what this weekend's about?

105
00:05:55,548 --> 00:05:59,040
This is about you trying to relieve your guilt over the time capsule.

106
00:06:01,115 --> 00:06:02,950
If you hate me so much, why'd you even come?

107
00:06:02,957 --> 00:06:06,173
I came for my friends, especially Lucas.

108
00:06:06,176 --> 00:06:07,981
But make no mistake --

109
00:06:08,478 --> 00:06:11,113
I'm here for everybody but you.

110
00:06:57,847 --> 00:06:59,472
Nice jump back there.

111
00:06:59,928 --> 00:07:00,923
You too.

112
00:07:00,927 --> 00:07:03,332
I think we totally scared the crap out of some cows.

113
00:07:03,506 --> 00:07:04,863
You know what? Maybe we should be careful.

114
00:07:04,867 --> 00:07:06,632
I don't know, given our family driving history,

115
00:07:06,635 --> 00:07:08,683
one of us is bound to end up in the hospital.

116
00:07:09,868 --> 00:07:12,192
Hey, check this out.

117
00:07:15,547 --> 00:07:16,380
Haley's ring?

118
00:07:16,386 --> 00:07:18,713
Yeah, I swiped it a couple minutes ago.

119
00:07:19,458 --> 00:07:21,351
I need you to hold onto that for me.

120
00:07:21,368 --> 00:07:22,113
Why?

121
00:07:22,118 --> 00:07:23,760
'Cause I'm gonna ask her to marry me.

122
00:07:25,326 --> 00:07:27,833
Okay, I'm sorry, but didn't you already do that?

123
00:07:27,836 --> 00:07:29,321
Yeah, but...

124
00:07:29,746 --> 00:07:31,851
I  was thinking about Keith and your mom

125
00:07:31,858 --> 00:07:35,133
and how they never got a chance to stand in front of their family and friends

126
00:07:35,136 --> 00:07:37,670
and  tell everybody how they feel, you know?

127
00:07:37,937 --> 00:07:38,800
Yeah.

128
00:07:38,806 --> 00:07:40,291
And Haley and I never did that, either.

129
00:07:40,298 --> 00:07:42,522
So now that we're back together,

130
00:07:42,525 --> 00:07:44,472
I want to do things the right way.

131
00:07:46,857 --> 00:07:48,382
Dude, these things are awesome!

132
00:07:48,387 --> 00:07:51,022
I just scared the hell out of some cows!

133
00:07:56,276 --> 00:07:58,091
So what do you think, man? You gonna help me out?

134
00:07:58,096 --> 00:08:00,440
Yeah, but you do know Haley's gonna freak

135
00:08:00,445 --> 00:08:01,810
when she notices her ring's gone.

136
00:08:01,815 --> 00:08:04,670
Oh! Oh, this cannot be happening.

137
00:08:05,187 --> 00:08:06,033
What?

138
00:08:06,037 --> 00:08:06,982
My ring is gone.

139
00:08:06,998 --> 00:08:08,012
- Your wedding ring?
- Yep.

140
00:08:08,015 --> 00:08:10,311
- Why'd you take it off?
- Is that important right now?

141
00:08:10,317 --> 00:08:12,732
Okay, Haley, calm down. Just stop -- hey!

142
00:08:12,737 --> 00:08:14,050
Stop. We'll find it.

143
00:08:14,058 --> 00:08:15,913
Think -- where'd you have it last?

144
00:08:15,912 --> 00:08:18,256
I don't know. I had it in the car ride on the way over here,

145
00:08:18,257 --> 00:08:20,636
and then I just started unpacking.

146
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:23,732
And then I went -- oh, to the bathroom, I think.

147
00:08:25,077 --> 00:08:28,050
I think I should have took it off when I washed my hands.

148
00:08:29,506 --> 00:08:32,373
Oh, my god. If I washed it down the drain, Nathan's gonna freak out.

149
00:08:32,385 --> 00:08:34,061
Haley, chill, okay?

150
00:08:34,065 --> 00:08:35,943
Even if it is down the drain, we can still get it back.

151
00:08:35,945 --> 00:08:37,453
Do you have a pipe wrench?

152
00:08:37,455 --> 00:08:39,643
Oh, sure. In my purse next to the belt sander.

153
00:08:39,655 --> 00:08:41,412
Listen, jokey, go find a pipe wrench

154
00:08:41,418 --> 00:08:43,872
or I'll find one and beat you with it, okay?

155
00:08:44,018 --> 00:08:45,520
I'm so glad I invited you.

156
00:08:45,527 --> 00:08:46,870
I'll get the toolbox.

157
00:08:54,308 --> 00:08:56,150
Okay, time to cry.

158
00:09:09,037 --> 00:09:12,023
Okay, need to find Lucas.

159
00:09:22,707 --> 00:09:25,212
Hi, guys. Have you seen Lucas?

160
00:09:25,215 --> 00:09:28,422
Yeah. He's out in the woods driving ATM's with Nathan and Mouth.

161
00:09:28,995 --> 00:09:33,452
Oh, did he say when he was gonna be back? 'Cause I need him for something.

162
00:09:33,456 --> 00:09:34,583
Anything we can help you with?

163
00:09:34,588 --> 00:09:36,842
No, this definitely requires Lucas.

164
00:09:38,448 --> 00:09:40,973
I'm gonna take a nap before dinner. Just --

165
00:09:40,987 --> 00:09:42,030
Bye.

166
00:09:47,177 --> 00:09:48,423
She was horny, right?

167
00:09:48,425 --> 00:09:49,722
Oh, yeah, definitely.

168
00:09:49,736 --> 00:09:50,790
You ready to get in?

169
00:09:50,795 --> 00:09:52,221
Maybe for a couple minutes.

170
00:09:52,225 --> 00:09:53,612
The hornets about to play the rockets,

171
00:09:53,615 --> 00:09:56,003
and I really want to check out that big screen.

172
00:09:56,006 --> 00:09:59,862
But wouldn't you rather check out my big screen?

173
00:10:01,147 --> 00:10:03,322
That really don't make no sense.

174
00:10:03,637 --> 00:10:05,343
But somehow I don't care.

175
00:10:13,757 --> 00:10:15,552
What is that?

176
00:10:15,567 --> 00:10:18,580
Well, hopefully it's the crap hiding your ring.

177
00:10:21,487 --> 00:10:23,860
So we sift through it?

178
00:10:24,128 --> 00:10:28,061
Oh, no, no. We don't sift through it.

179
00:10:29,375 --> 00:10:31,101
Look, maybe it's not in there.

180
00:10:31,108 --> 00:10:32,310
Where else have you been?

181
00:10:32,318 --> 00:10:34,393
To check out the other bedrooms.

182
00:10:41,956 --> 00:10:43,771
Aah! Sorry!

183
00:10:43,775 --> 00:10:46,032
Doesn't anybody knock anymore?

184
00:10:47,565 --> 00:10:48,523
Did you find it?

185
00:10:48,525 --> 00:10:49,880
Not exactly.

186
00:10:49,888 --> 00:10:51,892
That was not what it looked like. You saw nothing.

187
00:10:51,897 --> 00:10:54,212
Brooke, I am so sorry. I was just looking for Haley's ring.

188
00:10:54,225 --> 00:10:57,830
I had no idea that you'd be in there "brooking" yourself.

189
00:10:57,838 --> 00:11:00,643
Very funny. Now I suppose you're gonna blab about this to everybody.

190
00:11:00,656 --> 00:11:02,312
Brooke, I promise. I won't say a thing.

191
00:11:02,788 --> 00:11:05,471
- Haley, find your ring?
- No, I found a nickel

192
00:11:05,478 --> 00:11:08,710
and a really gross assortment of drain hair dating back to the late '80s.

193
00:11:08,716 --> 00:11:10,890
Your wedding ring? Nathan is gonna kill you.

194
00:11:10,896 --> 00:11:12,211
Yeah, I know. Thanks, Brooke.

195
00:11:12,218 --> 00:11:14,713
The bathroom's a mess. Are paper towels in here?

196
00:11:17,057 --> 00:11:18,232
Why's it locked?

197
00:11:18,238 --> 00:11:19,840
Sorry, this cabinet's off-limits.

198
00:11:19,847 --> 00:11:21,351
Why? What's in there?

199
00:11:21,418 --> 00:11:22,792
It's just private.

200
00:11:22,796 --> 00:11:25,871
You know how people don't like private things revealed.

201
00:11:27,848 --> 00:11:29,252
So, look at the time.

202
00:11:29,256 --> 00:11:31,373
Um, oh, hey, the guys from Sunkist called.

203
00:11:31,388 --> 00:11:33,071
They're hosting this club night not too far from here,

204
00:11:33,076 --> 00:11:34,171
so I thought maybe we could go?

205
00:11:34,178 --> 00:11:35,753
Tonight? What about my ring?

206
00:11:35,757 --> 00:11:37,151
Haley, we will find your ring.

207
00:11:37,156 --> 00:11:39,851
In the meantime, just hide that finger.

208
00:12:03,447 --> 00:12:06,170
Why are you wearing those mittens? It's like a million degrees in here.

209
00:12:06,176 --> 00:12:09,021
Um, my hands are just cold today.

210
00:12:09,486 --> 00:12:12,091
So, you never said anything about my letter.

211
00:12:12,096 --> 00:12:14,202
Oh, your letter.

212
00:12:14,205 --> 00:12:17,352
It had a, uh, surprising effect on me.

213
00:12:17,368 --> 00:12:19,153
Well, I hoped that it would.

214
00:12:19,156 --> 00:12:21,893
Yeah, who knew words could be such a turn-on?

215
00:12:23,538 --> 00:12:24,853
I'm having the best time.

216
00:12:24,855 --> 00:12:26,060
Me too.

217
00:12:29,378 --> 00:12:31,420
Apparently, not everyone else is.

218
00:12:32,515 --> 00:12:33,822
I'll be right back.

219
00:12:38,735 --> 00:12:41,861
If you're coming over here to say, "I told you so," save your breath.

220
00:12:42,116 --> 00:12:44,430
Haven't heard from "Pete" yet?

221
00:12:44,465 --> 00:12:45,482
No.

222
00:12:45,487 --> 00:12:47,461
Well, maybe "Pete" lost his phone.

223
00:12:47,467 --> 00:12:51,321
Okay, this whole "finger quotes thing" is starting to "piss me off."

224
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:54,203
Listen, some guy named Rudy keeps asking me to dance,

225
00:12:54,207 --> 00:12:56,223
so if you could help me out, that would be great.

226
00:12:56,226 --> 00:12:57,090
Go.

227
00:13:47,495 --> 00:13:48,861
Are you okay?

228
00:13:49,558 --> 00:13:51,210
Yeah, I'm fine.

229
00:13:52,565 --> 00:13:55,103
I was just thinking about how beautiful it is here.

230
00:13:56,538 --> 00:13:58,432
It's weird, but...

231
00:13:59,008 --> 00:14:03,383
sometimes I have these moments where I feel like Keith is here with me.

232
00:14:05,388 --> 00:14:06,762
He is.

233
00:14:25,318 --> 00:14:26,692
What are you thinking about?

234
00:14:29,446 --> 00:14:30,941
Truthfully?

235
00:14:31,647 --> 00:14:36,190
Whether it would be completely pathetic if I checked again to see if Pete's called.

236
00:14:37,205 --> 00:14:38,721
I'm sorry, Peyton.

237
00:14:39,176 --> 00:14:41,792
It's not your fault, Mouth.

238
00:14:41,797 --> 00:14:43,783
No, not for that.

239
00:14:44,128 --> 00:14:45,871
I mean about what happened to you,

240
00:14:45,877 --> 00:14:47,573
you know, with your leg.

241
00:14:48,076 --> 00:14:52,303
Well, that's really sweet, Mouth, but it's not necessary.

242
00:14:54,725 --> 00:15:00,180
Sometimes I forget to remember how really... wonderful life can be.

243
00:15:01,797 --> 00:15:04,602
So I'm trying not to do that anymore.

244
00:15:04,608 --> 00:15:06,181
That's great, Peyton.

245
00:15:06,476 --> 00:15:07,942
Good for you.

246
00:15:12,776 --> 00:15:14,111
Good night, Mouth.

247
00:15:14,167 --> 00:15:15,470
Good night.

248
00:15:26,678 --> 00:15:29,640
Mmm, something smells...

249
00:15:30,887 --> 00:15:32,101
...yummy.

250
00:15:34,777 --> 00:15:35,861
Hi.

251
00:15:38,457 --> 00:15:39,572
Pete?

252
00:15:40,505 --> 00:15:41,800
What is this?

253
00:15:42,485 --> 00:15:47,732
Peyton, um, I saw him standing here and just sort of thought

254
00:15:47,736 --> 00:15:51,023
I was dreaming and went for it. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

255
00:15:52,035 --> 00:15:53,853
Pete from Fall Out Boy is here.

256
00:15:53,865 --> 00:15:55,113
I know.

257
00:15:57,935 --> 00:16:00,423
So, I thought you were blowing me off.

258
00:16:00,425 --> 00:16:02,100
I said I'd be here.

259
00:16:05,357 --> 00:16:07,711
You guys are so adorable.

260
00:16:08,496 --> 00:16:10,740
Hey, Pete from Fall Out Boy. I'm Rachel.

261
00:16:10,757 --> 00:16:12,021
Thanks for letting me crash your party.

262
00:16:12,027 --> 00:16:13,880
No problem. But if you really want to thank me,

263
00:16:13,896 --> 00:16:15,713
there'll be a mushroom and goat cheese omelette waiting for me

264
00:16:15,727 --> 00:16:17,213
when I finish my shower.

265
00:16:19,276 --> 00:16:20,711
Do we like her?

266
00:16:22,017 --> 00:16:24,743
Pete from Fall Out Boy. You showed.

267
00:16:24,867 --> 00:16:26,841
Didn't anyone think I was gonna show?

268
00:16:27,795 --> 00:16:29,701
Hey, come on. I got to show you something.

269
00:16:37,177 --> 00:16:40,413
Oh, okay, what do you want to show me? It's freezing out here.

270
00:16:41,326 --> 00:16:42,632
This.

271
00:16:43,608 --> 00:16:45,671
Are you proposing to me?

272
00:16:45,687 --> 00:16:47,441
Lucas, this is really Naley.

273
00:16:47,446 --> 00:16:50,720
No, no, no. This is Haley's ring. Nathan stole it.

274
00:16:50,726 --> 00:16:53,420
I'm holding on to it till he proposes again tomorrow.

275
00:16:53,425 --> 00:16:56,340
Like a re-proposal? She's already had one.

276
00:16:56,346 --> 00:16:59,092
Well,  Nathan wants to have this big, fancy wedding.

277
00:16:59,097 --> 00:17:01,532
Oh, that is so romantic.

278
00:17:01,535 --> 00:17:03,901
Oh, what is so romantic?

279
00:17:04,646 --> 00:17:06,910
Oh, is that my ring?!

280
00:17:07,048 --> 00:17:09,172
Yeah, I found it. Surprise.

281
00:17:09,177 --> 00:17:13,083
Oh, my god. Thank you. Where did you find this?

282
00:17:13,688 --> 00:17:17,273
Uh, it was on the thing next to the other thing.

283
00:17:17,276 --> 00:17:20,452
I've been looking for this everywhere. Thank you so much.

284
00:17:20,467 --> 00:17:22,391
You're not gonna tell Nathan, are you?

285
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:24,281
Nope. I wouldn't do that.

286
00:17:24,297 --> 00:17:25,642
Thank you.

287
00:17:25,848 --> 00:17:27,451
Oh, god. You're the best.

288
00:17:31,057 --> 00:17:32,693
Now I'm pretty much dead.

289
00:17:32,707 --> 00:17:34,832
Yeah. Yeah.

290
00:17:39,517 --> 00:17:44,600
So, that's an oak tree, and over there, that's a slippery elm,

291
00:17:44,607 --> 00:17:47,880
or, to use its latin name, ulmus rubra muhl.

292
00:17:47,885 --> 00:17:50,632
Right. That's great, baby. We've been walking for a while now.

293
00:17:50,637 --> 00:17:52,213
Shouldn't we drop bread crumbs or something?

294
00:17:52,218 --> 00:17:54,181
Hey, look -- badger droppings.

295
00:17:54,185 --> 00:17:56,411
Yeah, baby, look, I'm not looking at that.

296
00:17:56,416 --> 00:17:57,913
Skills, relax.

297
00:17:57,915 --> 00:18:00,012
I have an awesome sense of direction.

298
00:18:00,018 --> 00:18:01,693
I  always know where north is.

299
00:18:01,698 --> 00:18:03,992
- Right. North, huh?
- Yeah.

300
00:18:04,076 --> 00:18:05,931
Okay, I got a little experiment.

301
00:18:06,046 --> 00:18:07,473
Close your eyes.

302
00:18:12,247 --> 00:18:13,713
Now  open your eyes.

303
00:18:14,077 --> 00:18:15,990
Now point north again.

304
00:18:16,005 --> 00:18:17,762
There. North.

305
00:18:17,767 --> 00:18:19,050
Ha!

306
00:18:19,356 --> 00:18:22,281
Before, when you pointed, you pointed that way.

307
00:18:22,286 --> 00:18:24,433
Yes, you did -- before, when you pointed,

308
00:18:24,436 --> 00:18:26,381
those berries was on your left-hand side.

309
00:18:26,388 --> 00:18:27,803
Now what side they on?

310
00:18:27,808 --> 00:18:32,132
Skills, I said I'm good with directions, not this whole left-right thingy.

311
00:18:32,408 --> 00:18:34,240
Great, so we lost.

312
00:18:34,247 --> 00:18:37,240
I don't know how I let you talk me into this, man.

313
00:18:44,458 --> 00:18:46,912
So, thanks for going on this walk with me, Pete.

314
00:18:46,918 --> 00:18:49,772
The doctor says it's good therapy for my leg.

315
00:18:50,177 --> 00:18:51,441
No problem.

316
00:18:51,446 --> 00:18:53,261
And, you know, your friends are pretty cool, too.

317
00:18:53,268 --> 00:18:55,762
Oh, god. You should have heard all the crap they were giving me

318
00:18:55,766 --> 00:18:57,261
before you showed up.

319
00:18:57,266 --> 00:19:00,522
I was starting to get scared you were gonna be my Snuffleupagus.

320
00:19:00,538 --> 00:19:02,323
Your Snuffa-what?

321
00:19:02,417 --> 00:19:04,300
My Snuffleupagus.

322
00:19:04,768 --> 00:19:06,380
You watched "Sesame Street," right?

323
00:19:06,386 --> 00:19:09,122
No, I was more like a transformers kind of kid.

324
00:19:09,126 --> 00:19:15,460
Oh, no. Okay, well, Snuffleupagus was, like, this big, hairy, mopey...

325
00:19:15,536 --> 00:19:18,230
elephant thing that only big bird could see,

326
00:19:18,236 --> 00:19:20,383
and so whenever he talked about him to other people,

327
00:19:20,396 --> 00:19:22,801
everyone thought big bird was just making him up.

328
00:19:22,807 --> 00:19:25,400
Right, so Snuffleupagus would just show up

329
00:19:25,407 --> 00:19:27,570
and start cooking everybody breakfast.

330
00:19:28,428 --> 00:19:30,462
Okay, maybe something like that.

331
00:19:33,787 --> 00:19:35,541
So, this is, like --

332
00:19:35,776 --> 00:19:38,410
I don't know. I just never would have pictured this --

333
00:19:38,447 --> 00:19:41,683
a famous rock star showing up in the middle of nowhere

334
00:19:41,686 --> 00:19:44,250
to hang out with a girl he barely knows.

335
00:19:47,046 --> 00:19:49,011
Actually, that's not true.

336
00:19:49,586 --> 00:19:50,430
What is?

337
00:19:50,438 --> 00:19:54,103
I mean, even though we just met each other, I feel like I know you pretty well.

338
00:19:55,007 --> 00:19:56,543
How do you figure?

339
00:19:56,546 --> 00:20:00,070
Well, I've listened to your podcasts and your artwork,

340
00:20:00,076 --> 00:20:04,410
your dad, everything with Ellie, that Jake guy.

341
00:20:04,418 --> 00:20:07,513
Okay, well, um, if you're gonna put it that way,

342
00:20:07,516 --> 00:20:10,373
I guess I probably know you pretty well, too.

343
00:20:10,455 --> 00:20:12,691
I mean, I know all the lyrics to your songs,

344
00:20:12,698 --> 00:20:16,330
like, "My pen is the barrel of the gun.

345
00:20:16,335 --> 00:20:18,563
Remind me which side you should be on."

346
00:20:18,565 --> 00:20:20,531
So a hot girl quotes me to me.

347
00:20:20,535 --> 00:20:22,750
Is that wrong if that turns me on?

348
00:20:23,728 --> 00:20:25,200
Maybe a little.

349
00:20:27,187 --> 00:20:31,950
So since we know each other so well, I guess it's okay if I do this.

350
00:20:36,515 --> 00:20:39,510
You know what? You're right -- this walk was a good idea.

351
00:20:50,277 --> 00:20:53,103
Okay, so it was a bad idea.

352
00:20:53,106 --> 00:20:55,122
Why would you even show the ring to Brooke?

353
00:20:55,126 --> 00:20:56,451
I don't know. I was excited.

354
00:20:56,457 --> 00:20:58,430
And you know how Brooke likes these kind of things.

355
00:20:58,436 --> 00:21:00,340
Well, the proposal's ruined now.

356
00:21:01,047 --> 00:21:03,842
I mean, you don't need a ring to propose.

357
00:21:04,388 --> 00:21:06,161
Just adjust your plan a little bit.

358
00:21:06,176 --> 00:21:08,533
Because that's all Haley and I ever do.

359
00:21:10,958 --> 00:21:13,802
I mean, ever since we got married, nothing's gone the way we planned it.

360
00:21:13,808 --> 00:21:15,313
Something always gets in the way, like

361
00:21:15,318 --> 00:21:19,103
music or High Flyers or Chris, Dan.

362
00:21:19,115 --> 00:21:22,970
But isn't that just, well, life?

363
00:21:22,997 --> 00:21:25,040
I mean, everything doesn't have to be perfect.

364
00:21:25,045 --> 00:21:27,251
No, but this does.

365
00:21:28,077 --> 00:21:31,243
Why couldn't this one moment just work out the way I planned it?

366
00:21:31,245 --> 00:21:33,190
Just once, you know, for Haley.

367
00:21:38,105 --> 00:21:39,252
You know what?

368
00:21:41,707 --> 00:21:42,822
You're right.

369
00:21:43,658 --> 00:21:44,922
What are you doing?

370
00:21:45,245 --> 00:21:47,180
We're going to go get that ring back.

371
00:21:47,487 --> 00:21:48,852
You're right, Nate.

372
00:21:48,855 --> 00:21:52,180
You and Haley deserve that perfect moment...

373
00:21:52,185 --> 00:21:53,962
at least once in your life.

374
00:22:06,565 --> 00:22:08,873
Skills, what are you doing?

375
00:22:08,887 --> 00:22:10,211
We have to keep walking.

376
00:22:10,218 --> 00:22:13,060
For what? So we can get more lost than we already are?

377
00:22:13,065 --> 00:22:14,982
Look, baby, let's just stay put.

378
00:22:14,987 --> 00:22:17,790
Once it gets dark, somebody'll come looking for us.

379
00:22:18,208 --> 00:22:19,210
Okay.

380
00:22:19,216 --> 00:22:20,731
I'll make you a campfire.

381
00:22:20,926 --> 00:22:22,290
With what?

382
00:22:22,295 --> 00:22:25,230
Girl Scout motto -- always come prepared.

383
00:22:27,255 --> 00:22:28,130
Okay.

384
00:22:28,136 --> 00:22:31,851
A fire will keep us warm and attract the rescue helicopters.

385
00:22:31,868 --> 00:22:33,731
Look at my baby.

386
00:22:33,795 --> 00:22:35,942
Look at the little Scout.

387
00:22:36,698 --> 00:22:39,482
These matches are pretty old, but...

388
00:22:41,487 --> 00:22:42,831
...they still work.

389
00:22:42,907 --> 00:22:44,441
Okay, cool.

390
00:22:44,446 --> 00:22:46,173
Let's see the fire.

391
00:22:49,386 --> 00:22:50,582
What?

392
00:22:51,997 --> 00:22:53,701
That was the last one.

393
00:23:02,118 --> 00:23:03,962
So, how mad was Nathan?

394
00:23:03,966 --> 00:23:07,782
Not thrilled, but I told him I'd get the ring back.

395
00:23:07,785 --> 00:23:09,240
Great. So get it back.

396
00:23:09,245 --> 00:23:10,340
How?

397
00:23:10,348 --> 00:23:13,022
There's no way Haley's gonna let that ring out of her sight now.

398
00:23:13,026 --> 00:23:15,192
Lucas, there's always a way.

399
00:23:22,347 --> 00:23:24,001
- Hey.
- Hey.

400
00:23:24,007 --> 00:23:27,860
You're not seriously wearing your ring in here, are you?

401
00:23:27,868 --> 00:23:29,541
Yeah, why?

402
00:23:30,096 --> 00:23:33,000
Swirling water, the drain...

403
00:23:33,605 --> 00:23:36,290
You know what? That's a really good point, actually.

404
00:23:42,545 --> 00:23:43,831
Thanks, Brooke.

405
00:23:43,886 --> 00:23:45,202
Yeah.

406
00:23:55,048 --> 00:23:56,043
Brooke?

407
00:24:22,337 --> 00:24:23,742
What the hell?

408
00:24:33,165 --> 00:24:35,183
Hey, Lucas, it's getting dark out.

409
00:24:35,187 --> 00:24:36,682
What are Bevin and Skills doing?

410
00:24:36,685 --> 00:24:38,572
They're gonna miss dinner.

411
00:24:38,576 --> 00:24:40,220
You're right. You got a flashlight?

412
00:24:43,475 --> 00:24:44,662
Perfect.

413
00:24:44,668 --> 00:24:45,911
Be right back.

414
00:24:54,775 --> 00:24:56,041
Bevin?!

415
00:24:57,696 --> 00:24:59,032
Skills?!

416
00:25:02,065 --> 00:25:03,750
Bevin?! Skills?!

417
00:25:03,756 --> 00:25:04,822
- You hear that?
- What?

418
00:25:04,826 --> 00:25:06,942
That voice. It sounds like Lucas.

419
00:25:06,946 --> 00:25:08,562
Where's that light coming from?

420
00:25:09,465 --> 00:25:10,613
Oh, come on.

421
00:25:10,786 --> 00:25:12,832
Skills?! Bevin?!

422
00:25:12,995 --> 00:25:14,201
Skills?!

423
00:25:14,908 --> 00:25:16,270
Bevin?!

424
00:25:17,886 --> 00:25:19,313
That is Lucas.

425
00:25:19,325 --> 00:25:20,951
You guys coming to dinner or what?

426
00:25:20,956 --> 00:25:23,271
That house been there the whole damn time?

427
00:25:23,276 --> 00:25:25,271
I told you I knew where north was.

428
00:25:29,995 --> 00:25:32,932
Yeah, I guess between me losing my ring and Bevin and Skills losing themselves,

429
00:25:32,936 --> 00:25:35,170
it has been a pretty eventful weekend.

430
00:25:38,348 --> 00:25:40,332
I thought you were gonna get that ring.

431
00:25:40,336 --> 00:25:41,651
Brooke's working on it.

432
00:25:41,656 --> 00:25:43,302
Well, you're running out of time.

433
00:25:46,608 --> 00:25:48,542
Hey, guys, I've got an idea.

434
00:25:48,547 --> 00:25:50,172
How about we play "I never"?

435
00:25:50,176 --> 00:25:52,080
Oh, yeah, that always turns out great.

436
00:25:52,085 --> 00:25:54,171
Come on. It'll be fun. I'll start.

437
00:25:54,175 --> 00:25:57,562
I never... had a gold record.

438
00:26:02,515 --> 00:26:04,300
Okay, Pete, you do one.

439
00:26:04,306 --> 00:26:05,451
Okay.

440
00:26:05,458 --> 00:26:09,353
I've never spent a cool weekend in the woods.

441
00:26:11,997 --> 00:26:13,803
Okay, that was lame.

442
00:26:14,926 --> 00:26:17,663
- Okay, that was rude.
- Really?

443
00:26:17,666 --> 00:26:18,883
Yeah.

444
00:26:19,476 --> 00:26:20,952
Okay, my turn.

445
00:26:21,016 --> 00:26:25,031
I never got caught "brooking" myself in the bedroom yesterday.

446
00:26:26,706 --> 00:26:29,022
You said you weren't gonna tell!

447
00:26:29,027 --> 00:26:30,693
We didn't shake on it.

448
00:26:31,657 --> 00:26:34,312
Wait, "brooking" yourself? What is that?

449
00:26:38,756 --> 00:26:39,840
Brooke!

450
00:26:40,526 --> 00:26:41,780
Okay.

451
00:26:42,748 --> 00:26:44,770
Come on, Brooke. Drink up.

452
00:26:47,648 --> 00:26:49,731
Wait, hold on, Bevin. Why you drinking?

453
00:26:49,887 --> 00:26:50,900
You even know what that means?

454
00:26:50,908 --> 00:26:53,321
Mm-hmm. I "Brooke" myself all the time.

455
00:26:58,436 --> 00:27:01,303
She keep on talking like that, I might have to "Brooke" myself.

456
00:27:01,307 --> 00:27:02,712
Okay!

457
00:27:04,835 --> 00:27:07,150
Can we please stop calling it that?!

458
00:27:20,995 --> 00:27:22,070
Yo.

459
00:27:23,195 --> 00:27:24,983
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

460
00:27:27,107 --> 00:27:29,542
I was just trying to think of an "I never,"

461
00:27:29,545 --> 00:27:33,660
and I realized I never spent enough time with him, you know?

462
00:27:33,667 --> 00:27:34,972
Keith.

463
00:27:36,336 --> 00:27:38,071
But it's weird.

464
00:27:39,707 --> 00:27:41,273
Even though he's gone,

465
00:27:41,277 --> 00:27:45,551
a part of me just still feels really happy for the time that I did have.

466
00:27:47,755 --> 00:27:50,881
I think that's what this weekend's about --

467
00:27:51,197 --> 00:27:53,451
not regretting our pasts

468
00:27:53,457 --> 00:27:56,720
but appreciating everything that we've got now --

469
00:27:56,727 --> 00:27:59,600
great friends, great memories.

470
00:28:02,048 --> 00:28:03,450
And you know what?

471
00:28:06,338 --> 00:28:09,421
I think it's exactly how he would want it.

472
00:28:16,296 --> 00:28:18,473
Hey, Brooke. You here to give me a hand?

473
00:28:18,476 --> 00:28:20,231
Sorry, it just, uh, slipped out.

474
00:28:20,237 --> 00:28:23,162
That's funny for a girl who should be watching her back.

475
00:28:23,166 --> 00:28:25,580
Brooke Davis, are you threatening me?

476
00:28:26,678 --> 00:28:29,293
Let's just say payback's a bitch.

477
00:28:32,947 --> 00:28:35,572
Look, I know you have your issues with Rachel,

478
00:28:35,575 --> 00:28:37,693
but we all really needed this weekend.

479
00:28:37,987 --> 00:28:39,722
You still glad we came?

480
00:28:39,728 --> 00:28:41,582
Of course. I'm with you.

481
00:28:46,636 --> 00:28:48,803
Well, we still got to get that ring back.

482
00:28:48,806 --> 00:28:49,681
Yeah.

483
00:28:49,687 --> 00:28:50,872
Any idea?

484
00:28:50,875 --> 00:28:52,560
No. You?

485
00:28:55,687 --> 00:28:57,301
Wait a second.

486
00:28:58,018 --> 00:28:59,060
Got something?

487
00:28:59,065 --> 00:29:02,150
Yeah, but it's not subtle.

488
00:29:07,278 --> 00:29:09,972
Oh, Haley, I'm so sorry. I tripped over the table.

489
00:29:09,977 --> 00:29:13,232
Here, here, here. Let me soak this in club soda.

490
00:29:13,237 --> 00:29:15,042
You should go take a shower.

491
00:29:15,058 --> 00:29:16,423
That's not a bad idea, actually.

492
00:29:16,425 --> 00:29:18,250
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

493
00:29:18,577 --> 00:29:22,742
This is terrible. This is really bad.

494
00:29:22,867 --> 00:29:24,681
Take care of that. I'll be right back.

495
00:30:00,126 --> 00:30:02,252
I had a really great time today, Peyton.

496
00:30:02,257 --> 00:30:03,750
Yeah, me too.

497
00:30:06,625 --> 00:30:08,631
I probably should go sleep on the couch, though.

498
00:30:08,635 --> 00:30:10,281
Yeah, you should.

499
00:30:11,558 --> 00:30:12,583
But...

500
00:30:13,358 --> 00:30:15,120
you're not going to.

501
00:30:20,705 --> 00:30:23,161
So, how many tattoos do you have anyway?

502
00:30:23,167 --> 00:30:24,351
Let's see...

503
00:30:24,357 --> 00:30:27,140
37. No, wait, 38.

504
00:30:27,147 --> 00:30:29,210
I just got your name on my lower calf.

505
00:30:29,216 --> 00:30:30,200
You all right with that?

506
00:30:30,206 --> 00:30:31,501
Shut up.

507
00:30:31,616 --> 00:30:33,013
Stop it.

508
00:30:33,017 --> 00:30:35,203
So, what about you, Peyton? You got any tats?

509
00:30:35,206 --> 00:30:39,103
Um, I just have this dark angel between my shoulder blades.

510
00:30:39,107 --> 00:30:40,412
Really?

511
00:30:40,417 --> 00:30:41,843
No.

512
00:30:41,857 --> 00:30:44,841
Can you imagine what my dad would do if I came home with a tattoo?

513
00:30:44,845 --> 00:30:46,222
I'm in high school.

514
00:30:46,228 --> 00:30:47,502
Right.

515
00:30:47,587 --> 00:30:50,853
Speaking of which, how's this supposed to work, anyway?

516
00:30:50,997 --> 00:30:53,140
What, me and you?

517
00:30:53,148 --> 00:30:54,311
Yeah.

518
00:30:54,317 --> 00:30:56,730
I mean, we're just in two totally different places.

519
00:30:56,736 --> 00:30:59,192
You're this rock star.

520
00:30:59,216 --> 00:31:02,453
I'm just trying to pass A.P. english.

521
00:31:03,088 --> 00:31:06,041
I mean, I feel like the answer's to not over-think things.

522
00:31:06,046 --> 00:31:07,521
We're just having fun, right?

523
00:31:07,526 --> 00:31:08,540
Yeah, sure.

524
00:31:08,547 --> 00:31:10,331
And then we'll figure it out.

525
00:31:10,488 --> 00:31:13,160
So, that's your solution -- we'll just figure it out?

526
00:31:13,167 --> 00:31:15,542
Why not? Too easy?

527
00:31:15,988 --> 00:31:18,350
Whatever it is, can you figure it out soon?

528
00:31:18,356 --> 00:31:20,072
I'm trying to sleep up here.

529
00:31:20,625 --> 00:31:22,500
Mouth, how long have you been up there?

530
00:31:22,508 --> 00:31:24,770
Since you guys came in and started making out.

531
00:31:24,778 --> 00:31:26,971
Oh, my god. I'm so sorry.

532
00:31:26,977 --> 00:31:27,951
Mouth!

533
00:31:27,957 --> 00:31:29,273
Did you know he was up there?

534
00:31:29,276 --> 00:31:30,483
Totally.

535
00:31:30,485 --> 00:31:32,162
I thought you were cool with it.

536
00:31:33,018 --> 00:31:34,351
Oh, god.

537
00:31:37,135 --> 00:31:38,741
Oh, crap.

538
00:31:53,906 --> 00:31:55,701
- Hey.
- Hey.

539
00:32:01,167 --> 00:32:03,292
You've done a great thing, Rachel,

540
00:32:03,366 --> 00:32:05,592
having everyone here like this.

541
00:32:07,025 --> 00:32:09,752
Even if it's all about me relieving my guilt?

542
00:32:09,758 --> 00:32:11,233
I was wrong.

543
00:32:11,415 --> 00:32:13,133
People are healing.

544
00:32:13,137 --> 00:32:14,911
Lucas, Haley...

545
00:32:15,305 --> 00:32:18,631
Peyton's really healing with that Pete guy.

546
00:32:21,138 --> 00:32:24,302
Still doesn't make up for me opening the time capsule.

547
00:32:24,905 --> 00:32:27,500
You know, I never asked why you did it.

548
00:32:27,576 --> 00:32:30,260
You don't have to tell me if you don't want to.

549
00:32:30,268 --> 00:32:31,512
I just...

550
00:32:34,585 --> 00:32:37,982
I just want to understand why you opened the time capsule.

551
00:32:39,348 --> 00:32:40,770
I don't know.

552
00:32:41,275 --> 00:32:43,272
To mess with people, I guess.

553
00:32:43,276 --> 00:32:47,210
I thought if I opened it, it would reveal everyone for who they really were --

554
00:32:47,556 --> 00:32:52,241
you know, just throw a wrench in the works and watch them squirm.

555
00:32:56,325 --> 00:32:58,280
But I didn't want anyone to die.

556
00:33:00,307 --> 00:33:02,470
I'm gonna tell everybody that I did it.

557
00:33:02,896 --> 00:33:04,030
No, you shouldn't.

558
00:33:04,038 --> 00:33:06,272
Why not? At least then they'd have someone to blame.

559
00:33:06,276 --> 00:33:10,023
Rachel, there was so much more going on with Jimmy than anyone knew --

560
00:33:10,027 --> 00:33:11,871
more than you could have known.

561
00:33:11,877 --> 00:33:13,681
But the time capsule set him off.

562
00:33:13,687 --> 00:33:16,080
And if it hadn't, something else would've.

563
00:33:17,677 --> 00:33:19,902
I looked at the capsule, too, Rachel,

564
00:33:19,905 --> 00:33:21,521
and it was wrong,

565
00:33:21,536 --> 00:33:23,412
but people are healing now.

566
00:33:23,426 --> 00:33:26,360
Peyton and Lucas, the people who were hurt the most --

567
00:33:26,366 --> 00:33:29,010
it won't do them any good to take them back there again.

568
00:33:31,317 --> 00:33:34,472
I say bury it and keep it buried...

569
00:33:35,006 --> 00:33:37,383
...just like the time capsule should have been.

570
00:33:39,786 --> 00:33:41,072
What about you?

571
00:33:42,148 --> 00:33:43,623
Can you forgive me?

572
00:33:47,128 --> 00:33:49,080
Only if you can forgive me.

573
00:33:52,606 --> 00:33:55,100
So, you want some company in there?

574
00:33:56,605 --> 00:33:59,312
I think I can probably squeeze you in.

575
00:33:59,315 --> 00:34:00,532
All right.

576
00:34:01,048 --> 00:34:02,221
What are you --

577
00:34:10,985 --> 00:34:12,572
I'm sorry, Mouth.

578
00:34:13,807 --> 00:34:15,851
I wish I could take it all back.

579
00:34:15,855 --> 00:34:18,453
Yeah, me too.

580
00:34:26,847 --> 00:34:28,483
What's that scar there?

581
00:34:31,415 --> 00:34:36,603
When I was 6, I went on this camping trip with my mom and Keith.

582
00:34:37,848 --> 00:34:40,511
It was the first time I'd ever gone fishing,

583
00:34:40,517 --> 00:34:44,253
and I accidentally hooked myself right through the thumb.

584
00:34:44,448 --> 00:34:45,373
Ouch.

585
00:34:45,377 --> 00:34:47,482
Yeah, hurt like hell.

586
00:34:48,205 --> 00:34:52,572
Well... I started crying.

587
00:34:53,617 --> 00:34:56,891
So Keith takes out his pocket knife

588
00:34:57,245 --> 00:34:59,971
and cuts his thumb, too,

589
00:35:00,257 --> 00:35:03,681
and said if we rubbed them together, then we'd be blood brothers.

590
00:35:04,338 --> 00:35:05,710
That's sweet.

591
00:35:07,215 --> 00:35:09,592
Well, now, whenever I look at that scar,

592
00:35:09,948 --> 00:35:14,232
I can remember that time and feel good.

593
00:35:16,438 --> 00:35:18,533
But what about my mom?

594
00:35:20,297 --> 00:35:25,292
You know, you said that everybody will heal eventually.

595
00:35:25,796 --> 00:35:27,503
But what if she doesn't?

596
00:35:28,528 --> 00:35:33,440
I mean, she's just so... angry right now --

597
00:35:33,725 --> 00:35:35,163
tortured.

598
00:35:35,165 --> 00:35:36,641
I know.

599
00:35:37,178 --> 00:35:39,683
But you've done everything you can,

600
00:35:39,835 --> 00:35:41,663
everything right.

601
00:35:42,038 --> 00:35:44,121
And whether she shows it or not,

602
00:35:44,128 --> 00:35:47,342
in her heart, your mom knows that you're there for her.

603
00:35:48,267 --> 00:35:49,712
Promise.

604
00:35:50,586 --> 00:35:52,231
So, what do I do now?

605
00:35:53,978 --> 00:35:55,410
I don't know.

606
00:35:56,246 --> 00:35:59,012
Have faith that she's gonna get better.

607
00:36:04,578 --> 00:36:06,703
I was going through Keith's belongings,

608
00:36:07,407 --> 00:36:09,950
and I found some things that I thought you should have,

609
00:36:09,957 --> 00:36:12,403
things that might mean something to you.

610
00:36:14,258 --> 00:36:18,810
The adoption papers that Keith filed to father the child that you abandoned.

611
00:36:20,797 --> 00:36:23,090
Invitation to Keith's wedding...

612
00:36:23,465 --> 00:36:28,061
his wedding to Jules, that is, or Emily or whatever the hell her name was.

613
00:36:28,675 --> 00:36:32,591
The wedding to the hooker that you hired to seduce your brother.

614
00:36:35,686 --> 00:36:37,522
Keith Scott Motors.

615
00:36:38,508 --> 00:36:40,301
He loved that place...

616
00:36:41,576 --> 00:36:44,300
...at least until you swindled him out of it.

617
00:36:45,358 --> 00:36:46,100
Karen.

618
00:36:46,108 --> 00:36:47,530
You killed him.

619
00:36:49,457 --> 00:36:51,143
You may not have pulled the trigger,

620
00:36:51,148 --> 00:36:53,673
but you let him go into that school.

621
00:36:54,885 --> 00:36:58,680
Karen, I had no idea Keith was going inside.

622
00:36:58,685 --> 00:37:00,511
I was trying to keep everyone safe.

623
00:37:00,516 --> 00:37:02,011
I had responsibility as the mayor.

624
00:37:02,018 --> 00:37:04,303
Responsibility as the mayor?!

625
00:37:04,308 --> 00:37:07,250
What about your responsibility as a brother?!

626
00:37:07,255 --> 00:37:11,340
What about your responsibility as a father?!

627
00:37:14,247 --> 00:37:17,442
You had two sons in there, Dan!

628
00:37:17,617 --> 00:37:19,600
Where were you for them?

629
00:37:22,796 --> 00:37:25,462
While Keith was lying there...

630
00:37:26,078 --> 00:37:27,553
...dying...

631
00:37:30,417 --> 00:37:32,052
...where were you?

632
00:37:38,556 --> 00:37:45,361
I wish it had been you who died in that school.

633
00:38:21,867 --> 00:38:23,241
Thank you.

634
00:38:23,538 --> 00:38:24,562
For what?

635
00:38:24,567 --> 00:38:27,152
I know you didn't want to come here, Skills, but you did anyway.

636
00:38:27,158 --> 00:38:29,162
Of course I did, ma.

637
00:38:29,167 --> 00:38:30,870
You're my shorty.

638
00:38:31,738 --> 00:38:34,492
I always wanted to be someone's shorty.

639
00:38:35,188 --> 00:38:37,131
See, the key in whisking is the more you whisk,

640
00:38:37,148 --> 00:38:40,122
the more air becomes trapped -- makes eggs spongy.

641
00:38:42,205 --> 00:38:43,592
You look happy.

642
00:38:43,925 --> 00:38:45,283
You too.

643
00:38:49,215 --> 00:38:53,223
Oh, man, this view is so beautiful from the dock.

644
00:38:53,227 --> 00:38:55,560
Well, you know, docks are kind of special for us.

645
00:38:55,568 --> 00:38:57,350
Remember the time Dan busted us for drinking?

646
00:38:57,356 --> 00:38:59,611
Oh, don't remind me.

647
00:39:00,455 --> 00:39:04,370
Although, I have to say, I did kind of enjoy throwing up on him.

648
00:39:05,805 --> 00:39:07,691
So, Haley, I couldn't help but notice

649
00:39:07,696 --> 00:39:10,331
you've had your hands in your pockets all weekend.

650
00:39:10,338 --> 00:39:11,830
What's that about?

651
00:39:11,835 --> 00:39:14,192
I guess I can't really hide it from you.

652
00:39:17,087 --> 00:39:18,813
I lost my ring.

653
00:39:19,026 --> 00:39:21,543
Twice -- and I'm really sorry.

654
00:39:21,546 --> 00:39:23,562
And you're probably just really disappointed --

655
00:39:23,567 --> 00:39:25,073
You mean this ring?

656
00:39:27,828 --> 00:39:28,903
Yeah.

657
00:39:28,906 --> 00:39:30,202
Where did you find that?

658
00:39:30,208 --> 00:39:31,870
I kind of stole it --

659
00:39:32,115 --> 00:39:33,651
twice.

660
00:39:35,637 --> 00:39:36,561
Haley...

661
00:39:36,576 --> 00:39:37,880
What are you doing?

662
00:39:37,887 --> 00:39:42,870
Over the past year, I learned so much about life and love.

663
00:39:43,105 --> 00:39:48,222
And even if I could, I wouldn't take back all the bad stuff that happened between us...

664
00:39:48,578 --> 00:39:53,110
'Cause it brought us here,this moment, this river.

665
00:40:01,397 --> 00:40:03,102
Marry me, Haley.

666
00:40:03,428 --> 00:40:07,203
Marry me again in front of all our friends and our family.

667
00:40:08,228 --> 00:40:09,373
Always --

668
00:40:09,378 --> 00:40:11,850
always and forever.

669
00:40:26,548 --> 00:40:28,660
So, this is it, huh?

670
00:40:29,226 --> 00:40:31,611
Peyton, it sucks that I have to go,

671
00:40:31,995 --> 00:40:34,091
but I'm gonna miss you.

672
00:40:34,268 --> 00:40:36,400
Is it okay if I miss you?

673
00:40:36,628 --> 00:40:38,611
You better.

674
00:40:49,075 --> 00:40:51,172
Oh, Peyton, don't worry.

675
00:40:51,177 --> 00:40:52,750
He's just leaving on a rock-concert tour.

676
00:40:52,757 --> 00:40:54,371
It's nothing to be concerned about.

677
00:40:54,376 --> 00:40:55,673
You're funny.

678
00:40:57,648 --> 00:40:59,470
Brooke, let's go.

679
00:41:00,515 --> 00:41:02,022
Sorry. I'm coming.

680
00:41:38,798 --> 00:41:40,641
So, any chance you'll be riding home with me?

681
00:41:40,655 --> 00:41:41,853
Forget it.

682
00:41:41,868 --> 00:41:43,880
Get your ass in the car.

683
00:41:50,345 --> 00:41:52,450
John Steinbeck once wrote...

684
00:41:53,207 --> 00:41:57,541
"Change comes like a little wind that ruffles the curtains at dawn...

685
00:41:59,235 --> 00:42:04,713
...and it comes like the stealthy perfume of wildflowers hidden in the grass."
