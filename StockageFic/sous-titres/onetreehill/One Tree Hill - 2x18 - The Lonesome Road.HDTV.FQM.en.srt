1
00:00:00,385 --> 00:00:02,027
Previously on One Tree Hill.

2
00:00:02,180 --> 00:00:02,949
Do I know you?

3
00:00:03,086 --> 00:00:04,701
Well you should, I’m your sister-in-law.

4
00:00:04,771 --> 00:00:06,851
We agreed to keep what happened between us a secret.

5
00:00:06,962 --> 00:00:09,215
Relax, Nathan, Haley doesn’t have a clue.

6
00:00:09,405 --> 00:00:10,502
Jenny’s mine now.

7
00:00:10,712 --> 00:00:11,568
Hand her over.

8
00:00:11,664 --> 00:00:12,466
Forget it.

9
00:00:12,539 --> 00:00:14,622
The rumours, they weren’t rumours.

10
00:00:15,573 --> 00:00:16,783
I’m gay.

11
00:00:17,049 --> 00:00:19,139
This is all my stuff, I don’t understand.

12
00:00:19,205 --> 00:00:21,474
I had my mom talk to your parents

13
00:00:21,534 --> 00:00:23,961
and they said that you could stay here till the summer.

14
00:00:24,017 --> 00:00:26,429
Thank you, Karen. You know you saved my life, right?

15
00:00:26,491 --> 00:00:30,258
I’m not gonna make it easy on you and sometimes you’re not gonna like me for it.

16
00:00:32,302 --> 00:00:34,093
It’s just like having a real mom.

17
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:29,021
Hello?

18
00:01:29,093 --> 00:01:30,866
Think fast, what’s in a gin and tonic?

19
00:01:32,442 --> 00:01:33,045
Taylor?

20
00:01:33,124 --> 00:01:35,294
Can you believe two guys already fell for that one, today?

21
00:01:35,386 --> 00:01:36,758
Drunks are so easy.

22
00:01:36,983 --> 00:01:38,823
Let me guess; you’re in a bar.

23
00:01:38,908 --> 00:01:40,095
Oh, not just any bar.

24
00:01:40,143 --> 00:01:44,561
I will have you know, I am in Athens, Georgia at The famous Swinging Donkey.

25
00:01:44,643 --> 00:01:45,626
What happened to Florida?

26
00:01:45,739 --> 00:01:47,853
Oh, Florida’s still there, I’m just not in it.

27
00:01:48,636 --> 00:01:49,779
So, how bout you?

28
00:01:49,999 --> 00:01:53,240
Well, I think I just passed a place called Slicklizzard, Alabama.

29
00:01:53,428 --> 00:01:56,220
Which means you went chasing after my sister.

30
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:58,841
Tell me she’s sitting next to you.

31
00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:01,283
No, I’m afraid not.

32
00:02:02,767 --> 00:02:03,837
I’m sorry, Nathan.

33
00:02:07,125 --> 00:02:07,817
Yeah.

34
00:02:10,403 --> 00:02:11,512
Listen, I gotta run.

35
00:02:11,708 --> 00:02:12,323
What’s going on?

36
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,197
Don’t ask.

37
00:02:13,521 --> 00:02:14,610
I’ll see you when I see you.

38
00:02:23,053 --> 00:02:24,206
You sure about this, Luke?

39
00:02:24,533 --> 00:02:26,806
Yeah, trust me. I talked to Nathan before her left.

40
00:02:27,037 --> 00:02:28,189
He said it was okay.

41
00:02:28,593 --> 00:02:29,582
How’s he doing anyway?

42
00:02:33,759 --> 00:02:34,912
Not so good, I guess.

43
00:02:35,587 --> 00:02:38,127
Yeah, well, I mean, I offered to clean this

44
00:02:38,178 --> 00:02:40,226
but it’s a good place to hide out for the next couple of days.

45
00:02:40,313 --> 00:02:43,575
So, get settled. I gotta run over to the dealership before school.

46
00:02:43,646 --> 00:02:44,998
What time are you meeting with your lawyer today?

47
00:02:45,096 --> 00:02:46,068
A couple of hours.

48
00:02:46,945 --> 00:02:50,665
I’m sorry I had to drag you into this mess, I just, I couldn’t involve my parents, you know?

49
00:02:50,732 --> 00:02:52,980
I told you; if you need me, call me.

50
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,013
Alright?

51
00:02:54,423 --> 00:02:55,018
See ya.

52
00:03:10,583 --> 00:03:11,868
Hey, Lucas. What’s up?

53
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:14,345
Oh… nothing.

54
00:03:14,832 --> 00:03:17,427
I’m just… dropping some papers off for you to sign.

55
00:03:17,724 --> 00:03:18,549
Everything okay?

56
00:03:19,046 --> 00:03:22,082
Yeah, I guess I just didn’t get much sleep last night.

57
00:03:22,876 --> 00:03:24,116
Yeah, I noticed you’re up early.

58
00:03:25,002 --> 00:03:26,506
Been working yourself pretty hard lately.

59
00:03:28,816 --> 00:03:29,788
I’ll be fine.

60
00:03:32,378 --> 00:03:34,544
I’ll tell you what; take the day off tomorrow.

61
00:03:34,628 --> 00:03:36,383
Bet you haven’t been to the Rivercourt in a few days.

62
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,551
Don’t wanna lose your stroke.

63
00:03:37,868 --> 00:03:39,198
It has been a while.

64
00:03:39,884 --> 00:03:40,576
Done.

65
00:03:41,068 --> 00:03:42,921
I’m heading off to a meeting. I’ll see ya later.

66
00:04:40,296 --> 00:04:41,028
Cash?

67
00:04:42,103 --> 00:04:42,809
Yeah.

68
00:04:44,092 --> 00:04:44,842
How much?

69
00:04:45,978 --> 00:04:48,058
Too much to count while my head was in the ceiling.

70
00:04:49,062 --> 00:04:49,994
Did you find anything else?

71
00:04:51,805 --> 00:04:53,628
There was a notebook in one of the bags.

72
00:04:53,741 --> 00:04:56,184
I didn’t get a good look at it but it… looked like a ledger.

73
00:04:56,265 --> 00:04:57,111
Makes sense.

74
00:04:57,218 --> 00:04:58,405
Gotta keep track of all the money.

75
00:04:58,487 --> 00:04:59,666
Yeah, but I’m just wondering;

76
00:05:00,765 --> 00:05:04,289
Why keep it all in the ceiling. Why not keep it in a bank where it’s safe?

77
00:05:04,427 --> 00:05:06,639
Well, there’s two reasons to hide money, Lucas.

78
00:05:06,915 --> 00:05:09,158
Either you don’t want Uncle Sam to know you have it,

79
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:11,344
or you don’t want him to know how you got it.

80
00:05:15,205 --> 00:05:17,155
- I gotta get that ledger. 
- No, you don’t.

81
00:05:17,237 --> 00:05:17,879
Andy.

82
00:05:19,613 --> 00:05:20,929
We gotta get that ledger.

83
00:05:28,916 --> 00:05:29,586
Darby.

84
00:05:29,664 --> 00:05:30,472
Hi, Anna.

85
00:05:31,506 --> 00:05:32,485
What’re you doing here?

86
00:05:32,951 --> 00:05:33,950
I got your e-mail.

87
00:05:36,114 --> 00:05:36,918
Can I come in?

88
00:05:40,451 --> 00:05:43,678
Or we could just stand out here until someone sees us,

89
00:05:43,733 --> 00:05:45,428
starts some rumours and then you can move again.

90
00:05:45,551 --> 00:05:46,294
Darby.

91
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:47,973
I’m sorry.

92
00:05:48,488 --> 00:05:49,401
That wasn’t funny.

93
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:53,927
Maybe this was a bad idea.

94
00:05:54,624 --> 00:05:55,290
No.

95
00:05:57,481 --> 00:05:58,541
It’s good to see you.

96
00:05:59,744 --> 00:06:00,634
Come on in.

97
00:06:10,005 --> 00:06:13,302
Okay, look just… tell me what is going on because there’s no way

98
00:06:13,333 --> 00:06:16,338
that a judge would give Nikki custody of Jenny.

99
00:06:17,732 --> 00:06:19,149
Judge has already ruled.

100
00:06:19,251 --> 00:06:22,375
Jake, a warrant’s been issued for your arrest.

101
00:06:22,446 --> 00:06:25,999
Right now, the police are our there and they’re looking for you and your daughter.

102
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:30,393
Trust me… trust me when I tell you this is your only option.

103
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:36,747
Can you just… tell me the truth here?

104
00:06:38,098 --> 00:06:41,042
If I give up my daughter today, how long until I get her back?

105
00:06:41,108 --> 00:06:42,686
How long until Jenny’s safe?

106
00:06:45,671 --> 00:06:47,765
Two months. Maybe three.

107
00:06:51,348 --> 00:06:52,474
And if I don’t give her up?

108
00:06:52,644 --> 00:06:55,271
You go to jail, and you stay there until you do.

109
00:07:11,036 --> 00:07:12,105
How bout a gin and tonic?

110
00:07:13,185 --> 00:07:14,568
How bout I see some ID?

111
00:07:20,056 --> 00:07:22,217
So, what brings you to town, sailor?

112
00:07:22,438 --> 00:07:24,418
I just wanted to check out The Swinging Donkey;

113
00:07:24,486 --> 00:07:27,224
see if it’s really as… classy as everybody says it is.

114
00:07:27,317 --> 00:07:28,791
Hmm, what d’ya think?

115
00:07:29,196 --> 00:07:30,221
Not so much.

116
00:07:31,147 --> 00:07:32,931
But, it does have one thing I’m kinda craving.

117
00:07:33,178 --> 00:07:34,966
I know, gin and tonic.

118
00:07:35,125 --> 00:07:36,374
Yeah, that too.

119
00:07:39,804 --> 00:07:41,202
I guess my phone call worked.

120
00:07:41,713 --> 00:07:42,799
You staying the night?

121
00:07:43,247 --> 00:07:44,124
I don’t know.

122
00:07:44,382 --> 00:07:45,667
Haven’t thought that far ahead.

123
00:07:45,754 --> 00:07:47,910
Well, I’m house-sitting the apartment upstairs.

124
00:07:47,986 --> 00:07:49,630
You’re welcome to stay with me if you like.

125
00:07:50,388 --> 00:07:51,504
What d’ya say?

126
00:07:53,116 --> 00:07:54,244
Sounds like a plan.

127
00:08:09,988 --> 00:08:13,432
Now why is it the garbage men always forget to pick up the white trash?

128
00:08:13,498 --> 00:08:14,642
I need to talk to Jake.

129
00:08:15,423 --> 00:08:16,163
Right.

130
00:08:16,356 --> 00:08:18,416
No police, no lawyers, just me and Jake.

131
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:20,007
The Rivercourt, six o’clock.

132
00:08:25,819 --> 00:08:28,830
By the way… the police are watching you right now.

133
00:08:30,257 --> 00:08:33,857
And you should know, as long as you help Jake hide Jenny, you’re an accessory.

134
00:08:34,507 --> 00:08:36,590
That means when you’re caught with my daughter,

135
00:08:36,663 --> 00:08:37,799
you’re gonna get arrested.

136
00:08:38,352 --> 00:08:40,820
But don’t worry; you can always go to college after prison.

137
00:08:50,886 --> 00:08:52,975
So, I guess you told everybody back at school.

138
00:08:53,241 --> 00:08:54,071
About us.

139
00:08:54,249 --> 00:08:55,868
No. Just me.

140
00:08:56,897 --> 00:08:58,023
How did people take it?

141
00:08:58,755 --> 00:09:01,479
It was pretty divided; still is I guess.

142
00:09:01,552 --> 00:09:04,608
Some people don’t wanna be seen with me. That part sucks.

143
00:09:04,777 --> 00:09:06,875
But I guess you find out who your real friends are.

144
00:09:08,151 --> 00:09:11,673
Look, um… you know, the truth is, Anna,

145
00:09:12,226 --> 00:09:14,555
there were some pretty dark days after you left…

146
00:09:15,032 --> 00:09:16,661
and it hasn’t gotten much easier.

147
00:09:16,998 --> 00:09:19,738
But do I regret being with you? Coming out?

148
00:09:20,952 --> 00:09:21,754
No.

149
00:09:22,098 --> 00:09:23,106
Not for a minute.

150
00:09:25,897 --> 00:09:27,837
And you know what makes it always better?

151
00:09:28,175 --> 00:09:29,809
Vanilla lattes, extra foam.

152
00:09:30,577 --> 00:09:32,820
You know, we should probably… head back.

153
00:09:32,916 --> 00:09:33,751
Hey, Anna.

154
00:09:34,883 --> 00:09:37,678
Hey, Lucas. Ha-oh, um,…

155
00:09:37,816 --> 00:09:41,190
um, this is… Darby. She’s, um…

156
00:09:41,999 --> 00:09:44,852
Actually, Lucas, Darby’s the girl I told you about.

157
00:09:45,235 --> 00:09:46,306
From my old school.

158
00:09:46,382 --> 00:09:48,307
Oh my God! I’ve heard so much about you.

159
00:09:48,410 --> 00:09:49,147
Really?

160
00:09:49,253 --> 00:09:50,964
Yeah, you’re different than I imagined, but…

161
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,624
Oh, thought I’d be more butch?

162
00:09:53,176 --> 00:09:54,717
Okay, I didn’t mean…

163
00:09:55,148 --> 00:09:56,188
Just kidding.

164
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,281
Well, I was just giving Darby the Tree Hill grand tour, do you wanna tag along?

165
00:10:02,372 --> 00:10:06,211
I’d love to, but I gotta go meet someone, so… call me tomorrow, okay?

166
00:10:08,496 --> 00:10:09,811
Pleasure to meet you, Darby.

167
00:10:13,467 --> 00:10:15,463
So that’s the famous Lucas, huh?

168
00:10:15,818 --> 00:10:16,682
He’s cute.

169
00:10:17,635 --> 00:10:19,100
So who’s the better kisser?

170
00:10:19,298 --> 00:10:20,830
- Me or him? 
- Stop.

171
00:10:28,207 --> 00:10:30,328
Bevin! Hi!

172
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:32,612
I have always imagined this room,

173
00:10:32,928 --> 00:10:34,152
just darker

174
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:36,073
and with Lucas on the bed.

175
00:10:37,833 --> 00:10:39,016
Anyway, get dressed.

176
00:10:39,210 --> 00:10:40,061
What for?

177
00:10:40,132 --> 00:10:41,069
It’s a surprise.

178
00:10:41,151 --> 00:10:42,543
I can’t, I have to work.

179
00:10:42,616 --> 00:10:44,832
I promised Karen I’d help her out at the café.

180
00:10:44,919 --> 00:10:47,879
Well, the cheer squad’s throwing a party tonight and…

181
00:10:48,218 --> 00:10:49,743
you kinda need to be there.

182
00:10:49,969 --> 00:10:52,242
The squad has some serious concerns, Brooke.

183
00:10:52,518 --> 00:10:56,803
Ever since you started this whole… presidency thing, you’ve been… drifting.

184
00:10:57,842 --> 00:11:01,012
I am still your captain, okay? I promise.

185
00:11:01,099 --> 00:11:04,877
Then prove it. Please. We miss you.

186
00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:09,961
Well, Karen did say she only needed me for a few hours

187
00:11:10,007 --> 00:11:11,487
so I guess I could do both.

188
00:11:13,377 --> 00:11:15,763
What do I wear to a cheer intervention anyway?

189
00:11:25,501 --> 00:11:26,244
Jake.

190
00:11:28,210 --> 00:11:29,333
How did you find me here?

191
00:11:29,398 --> 00:11:31,717
Oh, I guess I’m just better at this than you are.

192
00:11:32,212 --> 00:11:33,790
You wanted to talk, let’s talk.

193
00:11:33,918 --> 00:11:36,165
I told you to meet me at six o’clock, it’s only five.

194
00:11:36,227 --> 00:11:38,066
Like I’m gonna fall for that.

195
00:11:38,172 --> 00:11:41,076
Jake, look, you’ve gotta stop this; the hiding, all of it.

196
00:11:42,003 --> 00:11:43,671
I have a right to my daughter.

197
00:11:45,532 --> 00:11:46,745
You’re not getting her.

198
00:11:47,784 --> 00:11:51,895
Fine, well, I guess it’s time

199
00:11:51,942 --> 00:11:55,079
that I tell you something that, at the moment, is… kinda relevant.

200
00:11:55,142 --> 00:11:56,567
Okay, this should be good.

201
00:11:59,175 --> 00:12:00,451
She’s not your daughter.

202
00:12:02,576 --> 00:12:03,662
Think about it…

203
00:12:04,331 --> 00:12:05,934
we always used protection.

204
00:12:13,226 --> 00:12:14,157
Nice try.

205
00:12:15,998 --> 00:12:19,144
I guess it was just a matter of time before you thought of that one, huh?

206
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:20,685
- It’s the truth. 
- No.

207
00:12:20,829 --> 00:12:22,246
This is the only truth,

208
00:12:22,968 --> 00:12:27,098
no matter what, Jenny is, and she will always be, my daughter.

209
00:12:30,653 --> 00:12:31,576
I’m done here.

210
00:12:44,508 --> 00:12:46,603
Okay, get into the game, little girl.

211
00:12:46,822 --> 00:12:49,404
I always knew you were a lightweight but this is getting embarrassing!

212
00:12:49,486 --> 00:12:50,536
I’m just warming up!

213
00:12:50,602 --> 00:12:52,240
You’ve been warming up for the past two hours.

214
00:12:52,291 --> 00:12:54,099
Drag out of the bullpen and do a shot!

215
00:12:54,154 --> 00:12:54,969
Okay.

216
00:13:02,945 --> 00:13:04,333
How did you end up here?

217
00:13:04,606 --> 00:13:06,162
What, at this dream job?

218
00:13:06,247 --> 00:13:07,882
I don’t know, it’s kinda what I do best.

219
00:13:07,953 --> 00:13:08,767
Bartending?

220
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:10,892
Find random places to party.

221
00:13:11,009 --> 00:13:12,777
Next week, it’ll be someplace else.

222
00:13:13,091 --> 00:13:14,221
Lucky me.

223
00:13:16,004 --> 00:13:17,583
You’re not wearing your wedding ring.

224
00:13:18,787 --> 00:13:19,786
Neither is Haley.

225
00:13:20,702 --> 00:13:23,267
Nathan, you should know that before I called you,-

226
00:13:23,344 --> 00:13:24,937
Taylor, come on, we need you now!

227
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:28,592
We’ll talk about this later, I gotta get to work.

228
00:13:28,658 --> 00:13:29,821
I thought you said your shift was over.

229
00:13:29,887 --> 00:13:31,516
Somebody’s gotta pay for these drinks.

230
00:13:32,146 --> 00:13:34,434
Something tells me you’re gonna enjoy this.

231
00:15:19,461 --> 00:15:21,653
Karen. Hi.

232
00:15:21,755 --> 00:15:22,789
Did you have fun tonight?

233
00:15:24,084 --> 00:15:25,160
Not really.

234
00:15:25,682 --> 00:15:29,020
The party was kind of weak but I had to be there.

235
00:15:29,574 --> 00:15:31,494
Apparently I’ve been drifting.

236
00:15:31,718 --> 00:15:32,676
You been drinking?

237
00:15:33,838 --> 00:15:35,584
No, drifting.

238
00:15:38,477 --> 00:15:41,401
No, Brooke, I’m asking you if you’ve been drinking tonight.

239
00:15:43,157 --> 00:15:44,211
Just a little.

240
00:15:44,293 --> 00:15:45,855
I expected you at the café.

241
00:15:45,978 --> 00:15:48,990
I know, I lost track of time. I’m sorry.

242
00:15:49,045 --> 00:15:50,479
Well, sorry isn’t good enough.

243
00:15:50,704 --> 00:15:52,536
I advanced your salary and…

244
00:15:52,614 --> 00:15:54,447
I’d like you to return the money I gave you.

245
00:15:57,688 --> 00:16:00,560
I… kind of spent it.

246
00:16:03,694 --> 00:16:05,542
Got to bed. You’re grounded.

247
00:16:05,849 --> 00:16:06,822
Grounded?

248
00:16:07,595 --> 00:16:10,017
I’ve never been grounded in my whole life.

249
00:16:10,144 --> 00:16:12,044
Well there’s a first time for everything.

250
00:16:12,239 --> 00:16:13,908
Well, you’re not my mom.

251
00:16:14,123 --> 00:16:17,717
No. But right now, you’re my responsibility.

252
00:16:20,944 --> 00:16:22,970
But I was drifting.

253
00:16:40,873 --> 00:16:42,759
Okay, are there any security cameras?

254
00:16:43,067 --> 00:16:44,613
Uh, no, just the alarm.

255
00:16:52,710 --> 00:16:53,956
Okay, remember what I said;

256
00:16:54,089 --> 00:16:55,616
in and out, we do this fast.

257
00:16:55,861 --> 00:16:56,588
Yeah.

258
00:17:06,003 --> 00:17:07,826
Okay, just grab the ledger.

259
00:17:08,287 --> 00:17:09,675
I’ll stay here and keep an eye out.

260
00:17:15,807 --> 00:17:16,592
What’ve you got?

261
00:17:16,725 --> 00:17:17,617
It’s gone.

262
00:17:18,553 --> 00:17:19,444
What, the ledger?

263
00:17:19,532 --> 00:17:20,451
All of it.

264
00:17:29,576 --> 00:17:30,544
I don’t understand.

265
00:17:31,461 --> 00:17:33,176
It was right there a few hours ago.

266
00:17:34,846 --> 00:17:35,844
Ah, he knows.

267
00:17:36,865 --> 00:17:38,731
Dan, he knows and he moved it.

268
00:17:40,119 --> 00:17:41,200
So what do we do?

269
00:17:42,065 --> 00:17:43,591
Oh, that’s it, no, no, game over.

270
00:17:43,663 --> 00:17:44,528
So Dan wins?

271
00:17:44,578 --> 00:17:48,055
As much as I would love to keep playing this little game with Dan, it just got serious.

272
00:17:48,316 --> 00:17:50,897
If he knows you found that money, there’s no telling what he’s gonna do.

273
00:17:51,835 --> 00:17:53,391
I’m his son, Andy.

274
00:17:53,466 --> 00:17:55,049
And look what he just did to his brother!

275
00:17:55,770 --> 00:17:57,409
This guy’s got no conscience, Lucas.

276
00:17:59,796 --> 00:18:01,556
I think it’s time you move back in with your mother.

277
00:18:01,655 --> 00:18:02,540
I can’t!

278
00:18:05,130 --> 00:18:08,320
Come on, Andy. We’re so close.

279
00:18:13,507 --> 00:18:15,365
You have to find out if I’m right, okay?

280
00:18:16,082 --> 00:18:18,478
If there’s any chance that he’s on to you, you have to get out.

281
00:18:18,673 --> 00:18:21,159
I will. I promise.

282
00:18:21,648 --> 00:18:22,641
And one more thing;

283
00:18:23,404 --> 00:18:27,095
if your mother asks me anything about this, I’m not gonna lie to her. Understood?

284
00:18:41,826 --> 00:18:42,522
Brooke!?

285
00:18:42,711 --> 00:18:43,440
Yeah?

286
00:18:47,868 --> 00:18:48,646
What’s this?

287
00:18:48,902 --> 00:18:51,216
Just some stuff I ordered from the ‘mark.’ magalogue.

288
00:18:51,298 --> 00:18:52,256
Pretty great, huh?

289
00:18:52,563 --> 00:18:53,827
Are you going somewhere?

290
00:18:54,073 --> 00:18:57,555
Just out for a quick run, but you never know who you’re gonna see.

291
00:18:58,476 --> 00:18:59,910
Aren’t you forgetting something?

292
00:19:02,148 --> 00:19:03,101
Lip-gloss.

293
00:19:03,304 --> 00:19:07,098
Brooke, you’re grounded. That means you don’t get to head out for quick runs.

294
00:19:07,176 --> 00:19:09,275
Since when does grounding apply to fitness?

295
00:19:09,356 --> 00:19:10,309
Since now.

296
00:19:11,277 --> 00:19:12,905
That’s a little harsh, if you ask me.

297
00:19:12,982 --> 00:19:13,964
I’m not asking.

298
00:19:15,101 --> 00:19:17,107
Okay, so what am I supposed to do here?

299
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:18,582
Lucas does chores.

300
00:19:18,684 --> 00:19:19,438
Chores?

301
00:19:19,994 --> 00:19:21,015
Here’s a list.

302
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:27,005
So what, I pick the one I wanna do?

303
00:19:27,082 --> 00:19:29,847
Sure… and after you’ve finished with it,

304
00:19:29,949 --> 00:19:31,618
keep on picking until they’re all done.

305
00:19:32,330 --> 00:19:36,677
Okay, no offence, I didn’t come here to be a cleaning lady, lady.

306
00:19:37,282 --> 00:19:38,802
Well, then…

307
00:19:39,350 --> 00:19:42,099
I’ll help you pack your bags and we’ll call your folks.

308
00:19:42,170 --> 00:19:43,927
So I’m, like, imprisoned here?

309
00:19:44,495 --> 00:19:47,914
You can leave the house to go to school and to go to work.

310
00:19:47,991 --> 00:19:49,508
What work? I don’t even have a job.

311
00:19:49,578 --> 00:19:51,078
Oh, but you do have a job.

312
00:19:51,239 --> 00:19:55,013
Until you pay me back the money I gave you, you have a job at the café.

313
00:20:11,565 --> 00:20:12,635
You wanted to see me, coach?

314
00:20:13,316 --> 00:20:16,239
Take a seat next to your partner in crime here.

315
00:20:28,983 --> 00:20:30,826
Well now, Bonnie and Clyde,

316
00:20:31,681 --> 00:20:33,888
I guess you’re wondering why I called you here.

317
00:20:37,518 --> 00:20:39,217
Hey, Luke, I was just actually-

318
00:20:42,535 --> 00:20:44,471
He just… wants to talk to you for a minute, Jake.

319
00:20:47,502 --> 00:20:48,593
I’ll leave you two alone.

320
00:20:50,988 --> 00:20:52,504
I already know my options, coach.

321
00:20:54,813 --> 00:20:57,225
From what I’ve heard, you’ve only got one option.

322
00:20:57,317 --> 00:20:58,771
I can’t give her away.

323
00:21:00,549 --> 00:21:02,912
Son, you’ve got a good chance of getting her back.

324
00:21:02,986 --> 00:21:04,889
I can’t take chances like that.

325
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:07,681
It beats the alternative, doesn’t it?

326
00:21:07,757 --> 00:21:08,560
Does it?

327
00:21:15,468 --> 00:21:18,893
Coach, you remember last year? Beginning of the season?

328
00:21:19,549 --> 00:21:21,090
We had that away game at Bear Creek?

329
00:21:21,314 --> 00:21:22,240
Yeah, I remember.

330
00:21:22,487 --> 00:21:23,842
It was right after Jenny was born…

331
00:21:24,710 --> 00:21:27,444
and my parents were out of town all week, I couldn’t watch her, so…

332
00:21:27,970 --> 00:21:30,382
I decided to let Nikki have her, for the night.

333
00:21:31,994 --> 00:21:34,042
So I get home from the game and I call Nikki;

334
00:21:34,653 --> 00:21:35,636
there’s no answer.

335
00:21:36,681 --> 00:21:38,390
I go to her house and she’s not home.

336
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,035
So I… I looked everywhere, I called her friends.

337
00:21:42,102 --> 00:21:43,685
Then finally, after about an hour,

338
00:21:43,786 --> 00:21:47,124
I find her car and it’s parked across the street from some bar.

339
00:21:48,450 --> 00:21:52,198
Nikki was passed out in the front seat, the keys were still in the ignition

340
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:55,082
and there was frost all over the windows; I couldn’t even see her…

341
00:21:55,666 --> 00:21:57,115
and then I look in the back seat…

342
00:21:58,190 --> 00:22:00,288
and there she is, my little girl.

343
00:22:02,952 --> 00:22:04,041
She’s shivering.

344
00:22:05,327 --> 00:22:07,451
She didn’t even have a blanket on her, coach.

345
00:22:07,524 --> 00:22:08,728
- Jake, I- 
- One night.

346
00:22:09,561 --> 00:22:13,432
All she had to do was look after Jenny for one night.

347
00:22:13,707 --> 00:22:15,185
She couldn’t do it.

348
00:22:17,958 --> 00:22:21,434
And now they want me to give her my daughter for three months…

349
00:22:21,495 --> 00:22:22,581
worth of nights?

350
00:22:34,639 --> 00:22:36,329
So how’d it feel when you came out to Lucas?

351
00:22:37,026 --> 00:22:37,818
Terrible.

352
00:22:38,966 --> 00:22:39,698
Scary.

353
00:22:41,126 --> 00:22:42,325
Still feels scary.

354
00:22:45,088 --> 00:22:45,940
What about you?

355
00:22:46,636 --> 00:22:47,680
When you told your parents.

356
00:22:48,182 --> 00:22:52,882
Huh, well, uh, believe it or not, I practised in the mirror first.

357
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,599
And then when I thought I had it all memorised,

358
00:22:55,739 --> 00:22:59,241
I went downstairs, took a deep breath, and I told them

359
00:22:59,281 --> 00:23:03,435
I loved them very much but I had something I needed to tell them about myself.

360
00:23:03,675 --> 00:23:07,555
- How did they take it? 
- Honesty? Not as well as I’d hoped.

361
00:23:07,632 --> 00:23:10,305
I think they’re still trying to process how it affects their lives.

362
00:23:10,598 --> 00:23:11,596
What d’ya mean?

363
00:23:12,246 --> 00:23:14,841
Well, um, I read this book about coming out,

364
00:23:14,953 --> 00:23:19,941
and it said that for some parents, finding out your child is gay is like losing a loved one.

365
00:23:20,893 --> 00:23:23,320
All the dreams they might have had just vanish;

366
00:23:25,266 --> 00:23:28,165
no weddings, grandchildren.

367
00:23:30,135 --> 00:23:33,223
So I think when I told them, I shattered some of those dreams for them.

368
00:23:36,233 --> 00:23:37,048
Yeah.

369
00:23:37,150 --> 00:23:39,223
Even though things are still kinda weird,

370
00:23:39,331 --> 00:23:41,307
I don’t think I’ve ever been closer to them.

371
00:23:42,772 --> 00:23:44,308
Coz at the end of the day,

372
00:23:45,895 --> 00:23:47,917
I know they still love me.

373
00:23:51,056 --> 00:23:54,706
I know that… that’s what worried me the most.

374
00:24:00,196 --> 00:24:01,250
That they wouldn’t…

375
00:24:04,138 --> 00:24:05,730
Well you’re braver than me, Darby.

376
00:24:06,206 --> 00:24:07,245
No I’m not.

377
00:24:11,362 --> 00:24:12,145
Look…

378
00:24:13,388 --> 00:24:16,687
I didn’t come here to get you to come out to your parents.

379
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:20,101
I came here to help you understand that when you finally do,

380
00:24:21,223 --> 00:24:22,514
you’re gonna be okay.

381
00:24:27,876 --> 00:24:28,898
I’m gonna go.

382
00:24:29,958 --> 00:24:30,782
Long drive.

383
00:24:33,092 --> 00:24:34,054
I’m glad you came.

384
00:24:34,494 --> 00:24:36,563
Yeah, me too.

385
00:24:38,432 --> 00:24:39,261
I miss you.

386
00:25:08,114 --> 00:25:09,638
So this is you’re ‘A’ game, huh?

387
00:25:10,781 --> 00:25:12,060
You know what my dad always told me?

388
00:25:12,745 --> 00:25:15,599
Forget about practice; as long as you come to play,

389
00:25:15,675 --> 00:25:19,591
on game day when the stakes are high, odds are you’ll come out a winner.

390
00:25:20,211 --> 00:25:21,700
Last time was just a practice round.

391
00:25:21,931 --> 00:25:24,139
Since when are you taking advice from your dad?

392
00:25:24,783 --> 00:25:25,684
I know, alright.

393
00:25:26,616 --> 00:25:29,028
But if there’s one thing he knows about, it’s winning.

394
00:25:30,374 --> 00:25:33,334
Okay, so what are the stakes tonight?

395
00:25:34,455 --> 00:25:37,460
Well, if I make this shot,

396
00:25:37,905 --> 00:25:39,077
we go upstairs.

397
00:25:39,997 --> 00:25:41,153
And do what?

398
00:25:41,633 --> 00:25:42,712
Whatever I want.

399
00:25:42,949 --> 00:25:43,870
And if you miss?

400
00:25:46,226 --> 00:25:46,988
Let’s go.

401
00:26:04,990 --> 00:26:05,993
I can’t do this.

402
00:26:07,954 --> 00:26:08,882
Because of Haley?

403
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:09,732
No.

404
00:26:10,889 --> 00:26:11,678
Because of me.

405
00:26:13,433 --> 00:26:14,504
Haley called me…

406
00:26:15,677 --> 00:26:17,268
right after you left Austin.

407
00:26:18,989 --> 00:26:21,560
Were you planning on telling me this before or after we had sex?

408
00:26:21,979 --> 00:26:23,842
We weren’t gonna have sex, Nathan.

409
00:26:24,795 --> 00:26:27,970
I knew that; I was just waiting for you to figure it out.

410
00:26:30,904 --> 00:26:34,042
So what, you’re like my, uh… my guardian angel?

411
00:26:35,569 --> 00:26:37,605
No, it’s not that. It’s just…

412
00:26:39,459 --> 00:26:40,422
you’re lost…

413
00:26:41,507 --> 00:26:45,926
and lonely, and I’m pretty good at making people forget how lonely they really are.

414
00:26:46,105 --> 00:26:46,939
Right…

415
00:26:48,194 --> 00:26:50,483
that’s a nice way of describing what you’re really good at.

416
00:26:54,354 --> 00:26:57,261
Sleep if off, Nathan. You have a long drive tomorrow.

417
00:26:58,413 --> 00:26:59,362
What’re you gonna do?

418
00:27:00,149 --> 00:27:02,023
Apparently, what I do best.

419
00:27:18,593 --> 00:27:19,831
Hey, Lucas, come on in.

420
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:25,945
Uh, hey, um, I was just… returning a book.

421
00:27:26,027 --> 00:27:26,917
What you got there?

422
00:27:28,662 --> 00:27:31,008
‘The Hound of the Baskervilles’. Sherlock Holmes.

423
00:27:31,104 --> 00:27:32,765
Since when’re you a fan of Arthur Conan Doyle?

424
00:27:33,257 --> 00:27:34,757
Since I can remember.

425
00:27:36,441 --> 00:27:38,735
Every kid wants to be Sherlock Holmes at some point.

426
00:27:39,194 --> 00:27:40,131
Well, not me.

427
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:42,414
I was always partial to Professor Moriarty.

428
00:27:44,525 --> 00:27:46,182
You do realise he was the villain.

429
00:27:46,250 --> 00:27:47,628
That’s one interpretation.

430
00:27:51,893 --> 00:27:54,826
Well, um… thanks for letting me borrow it.

431
00:28:10,161 --> 00:28:11,237
Hey, Cinderella.

432
00:28:12,859 --> 00:28:13,879
You hanging in there?

433
00:28:14,022 --> 00:28:15,374
I take it you’ve heard.

434
00:28:15,511 --> 00:28:17,452
Well, my mom can crack the whip.

435
00:28:17,545 --> 00:28:20,989
I can’t believe she actually grounded me. I thought she liked me.

436
00:28:21,215 --> 00:28:23,386
Oh, Brooke, she does like you.

437
00:28:23,576 --> 00:28:25,608
Hey, she cares enough about you to ground you.

438
00:28:27,736 --> 00:28:30,288
So what number are you up to, huh? Three?

439
00:28:30,411 --> 00:28:32,417
Four. Mop the kitchen floor.

440
00:28:34,468 --> 00:28:36,037
And you’re using a sponge?

441
00:28:38,572 --> 00:28:39,556
Is that wrong?

442
00:28:44,514 --> 00:28:46,431
Okay… Brooke,

443
00:28:48,485 --> 00:28:49,448
this is a mop.

444
00:28:52,201 --> 00:28:53,696
Look, I’ll tell you what, alright;

445
00:28:53,943 --> 00:28:56,036
you take the evens, I’ll take the odds.

446
00:28:56,133 --> 00:28:58,525
And I’ll bet we can bust this out in like… half hour.

447
00:29:00,056 --> 00:29:01,044
Thanks, Luke.

448
00:29:02,049 --> 00:29:03,362
Anything for you.

449
00:29:07,511 --> 00:29:09,620
Mom… dad...

450
00:29:10,403 --> 00:29:11,790
you know I love you…

451
00:29:13,681 --> 00:29:16,624
but there’s something I have to tell you about myself.

452
00:29:21,858 --> 00:29:23,609
When I asked if we could move here,

453
00:29:24,238 --> 00:29:26,517
I told you it was because I couldn’t take the rumours…

454
00:29:29,102 --> 00:29:29,905
but really…

455
00:29:31,104 --> 00:29:33,566
I was just running away from my life.

456
00:29:35,185 --> 00:29:36,259
From who I am.

457
00:29:39,276 --> 00:29:40,054
Because…

458
00:29:41,672 --> 00:29:42,637
the rumours…

459
00:29:46,110 --> 00:29:47,094
they were all true.

460
00:29:48,902 --> 00:29:49,961
I like girls.

461
00:29:53,232 --> 00:29:55,612
You’ve always taught me to be proud of who I am.

462
00:29:56,790 --> 00:29:58,655
That’s not so easy for me because…

463
00:30:00,105 --> 00:30:02,602
I haven’t been able to accept who I am.

464
00:30:04,967 --> 00:30:05,889
Until now.

465
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:14,067
And I want you to know that this is hard for me…

466
00:30:15,019 --> 00:30:17,204
because I love you so much…

467
00:30:17,666 --> 00:30:19,508
and I never wanna disappoint you.

468
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:23,856
But I have to stop disappointing myself, too.

469
00:30:25,817 --> 00:30:27,956
And… I just…

470
00:30:29,247 --> 00:30:30,563
I hope you still love me.

471
00:30:35,155 --> 00:30:36,051
Hey, beautiful.

472
00:30:37,951 --> 00:30:39,527
I have to do something tonight.

473
00:30:40,997 --> 00:30:45,247
And I need you to know that I have searched from the bottom of my heart

474
00:30:45,303 --> 00:30:47,950
and I truly believe that this is the best thing for you.

475
00:30:48,514 --> 00:30:49,292
For us.

476
00:30:51,596 --> 00:30:54,830
I just hope that some day, you’ll be able to understand that.

477
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:04,324
You’re leaving?!

478
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:09,086
I’m sorry, Peyton.

479
00:31:09,198 --> 00:31:11,712
- No, I’ll go with you. 
- No. No, you can’t.

480
00:31:11,963 --> 00:31:14,257
- We can be together. 
- Yeah, I wish we could…

481
00:31:16,525 --> 00:31:18,635
Well then at least tell me where you’re going.

482
00:31:18,988 --> 00:31:19,832
Please.

483
00:31:20,826 --> 00:31:24,892
- Maybe I can help. 
- I can’t tell you right now.

484
00:31:25,603 --> 00:31:28,162
But I need- I need you to know something. I-

485
00:31:28,513 --> 00:31:30,968
Look, I’ve never been happier than when I’m with you.

486
00:31:31,055 --> 00:31:35,070
Okay, I’ve never… felt this much of… everything.

487
00:31:35,173 --> 00:31:38,008
And if I could, I would stay with you here forever.

488
00:31:39,924 --> 00:31:41,286
But I just can’t.

489
00:31:50,022 --> 00:31:52,002
You’re the only person I can truly count on.

490
00:31:53,390 --> 00:31:55,550
That’s why I need you to do one last thing for me.

491
00:32:14,772 --> 00:32:17,863
Sneaking away without saying goodbye? That’s original.

492
00:32:20,342 --> 00:32:24,141
I, uh… didn’t think you’d wanna see me.

493
00:32:26,993 --> 00:32:29,464
I’m really sorry, Taylor, for what I said.

494
00:32:29,829 --> 00:32:30,726
How I acted.

495
00:32:31,314 --> 00:32:32,159
It’s okay.

496
00:32:32,707 --> 00:32:34,197
You get one free pass with me.

497
00:32:34,350 --> 00:32:35,851
Next time, watch your back.

498
00:32:37,932 --> 00:32:40,059
I had fun, though… before that.

499
00:32:40,181 --> 00:32:41,099
I know you did.

500
00:32:42,598 --> 00:32:45,389
But after a while, all the parties just… blend together.

501
00:32:45,712 --> 00:32:47,796
You know, sometimes I just wish I could start over.

502
00:32:47,944 --> 00:32:50,596
You can. We all can, right?

503
00:32:52,547 --> 00:32:53,442
Not me.

504
00:32:54,206 --> 00:32:57,646
Once people think of you a certain way, you’re never gonna be able to change their minds.

505
00:32:59,249 --> 00:33:01,573
I am who I am and I have to live with that.

506
00:33:02,402 --> 00:33:05,465
But you, nobody’s put a label on you yet.

507
00:33:06,334 --> 00:33:07,937
You can still be whoever you wanna be.

508
00:33:08,430 --> 00:33:09,284
Without Haley.

509
00:33:11,942 --> 00:33:15,054
If she’s not gonna be there for you, you have to start being there for yourself.

510
00:33:18,372 --> 00:33:20,216
- I don’t know if I can. 
- You can.

511
00:33:21,076 --> 00:33:25,638
And you will, just… wake up every morning and live your life.

512
00:33:28,074 --> 00:33:29,647
What happens if she comes back?

513
00:33:31,665 --> 00:33:33,701
Well, then, it’ll be your decision.

514
00:33:39,769 --> 00:33:40,793
Get home safe, Nathan.

515
00:33:42,601 --> 00:33:44,624
Try not to go dancing on any bars.

516
00:33:44,895 --> 00:33:46,145
I won’t if you won’t.

517
00:34:18,584 --> 00:34:20,656
- Can I help you? 
- Yeah, I’m Jake Jagielski.

518
00:34:21,610 --> 00:34:23,283
There’s a warrant out for my arrest.

519
00:34:38,454 --> 00:34:39,530
Hey, Anna, what’s up?

520
00:34:42,005 --> 00:34:43,651
I told my parents.

521
00:34:43,862 --> 00:34:44,773
You told them?

522
00:34:45,368 --> 00:34:46,386
That’s huge!

523
00:34:46,933 --> 00:34:48,669
How’d they take it?

524
00:34:49,155 --> 00:34:52,276
Um… I’m not sure, really.

525
00:34:52,582 --> 00:34:57,666
They, they cried a lot but I think it was just because they were trying to understand…

526
00:34:58,439 --> 00:35:00,041
then, when I was finished,

527
00:35:00,737 --> 00:35:02,237
they told me they loved me.

528
00:35:03,737 --> 00:35:05,719
Which is all I really wanted to hear.

529
00:35:06,206 --> 00:35:08,438
I am… so proud of you, Anna.

530
00:35:09,851 --> 00:35:11,038
There’s more;

531
00:35:11,853 --> 00:35:15,621
I told my parents that they always taught me to be proud of myself

532
00:35:16,138 --> 00:35:18,652
and the only way for me to do that is…

533
00:35:18,801 --> 00:35:22,036
if I go back to my boarding school and finally be who I am.

534
00:35:22,651 --> 00:35:26,906
Oh… does that mean you’re leaving?

535
00:35:27,967 --> 00:35:28,831
Yes.

536
00:35:31,852 --> 00:35:34,265
I wanted to stop in and see Peyton, but…

537
00:35:34,442 --> 00:35:36,403
she’s got enough to deal with right now.

538
00:35:37,438 --> 00:35:39,399
- Tell her I’ll call her soon? 
- I will.

539
00:35:45,696 --> 00:35:47,504
I am gonna miss you so much.

540
00:35:49,607 --> 00:35:50,985
You’ve been a great friend.

541
00:35:51,186 --> 00:35:52,056
You, too.

542
00:35:55,154 --> 00:35:57,277
I’m a better person for knowing you, Luke.

543
00:36:05,353 --> 00:36:07,468
How bout one last game of horse, huh?

544
00:36:08,210 --> 00:36:09,407
That sounds perfect.

545
00:36:28,009 --> 00:36:29,177
Tell me you love me.

546
00:36:30,052 --> 00:36:32,790
And tell me you did not just touch that half eaten bagel.

547
00:36:32,904 --> 00:36:33,681
No, I don’t;

548
00:36:33,778 --> 00:36:35,454
yes, I did.

549
00:36:35,550 --> 00:36:37,666
And why are you waving that thing around in my face?

550
00:36:37,722 --> 00:36:40,752
Because it happens to be an invitation to the biggest party of the year.

551
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:42,278
Thanks, but I think I’ll pass.

552
00:36:42,329 --> 00:36:46,093
And for the record, there have been, like, six ‘biggest parties’ of the year this month,

553
00:36:46,189 --> 00:36:47,553
so get a new rating system.

554
00:36:47,639 --> 00:36:48,924
But this one is a ‘can’t miss’.

555
00:36:49,006 --> 00:36:50,276
And so was the last one.

556
00:36:50,357 --> 00:36:52,329
No, the last one was a ‘shouldn’t miss’.

557
00:36:52,436 --> 00:36:54,827
Just look at the invitation and I won’t say another word.

558
00:36:56,783 --> 00:37:00,138
This is a ‘Courtney Ryan’ party. This is a ‘can’t miss’.

559
00:37:00,210 --> 00:37:04,393
Told ya. The party starts at, like, nine so meet us there around… eleven thirty?

560
00:37:05,483 --> 00:37:08,447
Oh, and Brooke, welcome back.

561
00:37:20,741 --> 00:37:21,519
Lucas!

562
00:37:24,533 --> 00:37:25,313
Come on in.

563
00:37:28,416 --> 00:37:29,147
What’s all this?

564
00:37:29,234 --> 00:37:31,181
I thought it was time to upgrade the security system.

565
00:37:31,441 --> 00:37:33,633
Too many people know the pass-code to the main alarm.

566
00:37:35,005 --> 00:37:35,891
Oh, that’s a good idea.

567
00:37:35,978 --> 00:37:39,148
Besides, outside of the family, you never know who you can trust these days.

568
00:37:41,322 --> 00:37:42,261
I got you something.

569
00:37:47,904 --> 00:37:49,961
Thought you’d like it since you’re into Sherlock Holmes.

570
00:37:51,031 --> 00:37:52,342
I marked my favourite story for you.

571
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:58,430
Have you read that one?

572
00:37:59,147 --> 00:38:00,421
Yeah, a long time ago.

573
00:38:00,589 --> 00:38:02,787
It wasn’t very popular with the fans, but…

574
00:38:03,514 --> 00:38:05,407
I think it’s some of Doyle’s most honest work.

575
00:38:05,664 --> 00:38:06,508
Why’s that?

576
00:38:08,064 --> 00:38:09,984
Because he wrote what he was feeling.

577
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:13,067
He got tired of writing that character;

578
00:38:13,754 --> 00:38:14,675
The Snoop.

579
00:38:15,233 --> 00:38:16,503
All the sneaking around…

580
00:38:16,935 --> 00:38:18,020
all the deception.

581
00:38:19,478 --> 00:38:20,953
But he knew when it was time to end it.

582
00:38:21,393 --> 00:38:24,875
That’s why, in the end, the great Sherlock Holmes falls to his death.

583
00:38:24,952 --> 00:38:26,532
Well, I think maybe you missed the point.

584
00:38:26,661 --> 00:38:27,379
Did I?

585
00:38:27,465 --> 00:38:29,134
When Sherlock Holmes falls off the cliff,

586
00:38:29,201 --> 00:38:31,819
he pulls Professor Moriarty down with him.

587
00:38:33,795 --> 00:38:38,355
You see, he sacrificed himself to bring down the bad guy.

588
00:38:39,981 --> 00:38:43,291
That’s the point I think Doyle was trying to make.

589
00:38:44,807 --> 00:38:45,924
Well, like I said,

590
00:38:46,445 --> 00:38:47,945
that’s one interpretation.

591
00:38:50,874 --> 00:38:51,744
Hey, Lucas.

592
00:38:56,296 --> 00:38:57,469
I’ll be seeing you.

593
00:39:17,332 --> 00:39:18,292
Ready?

594
00:39:26,472 --> 00:39:27,508
Jake Jagielski,

595
00:39:28,578 --> 00:39:30,350
you have the right to remain silent.

596
00:39:34,528 --> 00:39:36,529
Ma’am, we have a warrant to search the property.

597
00:39:36,655 --> 00:39:39,775
Anything you say may be used against you in the court of law.

598
00:39:42,807 --> 00:39:46,774
You have the right to have an attorney present during questioning now, or in the future.

599
00:39:47,559 --> 00:39:49,160
If you can not afford an attorney…

600
00:39:49,678 --> 00:39:51,090
one will be appointed to you.

601
00:39:51,563 --> 00:39:54,746
Do you understand your rights as I have explained them to you?

602
00:39:57,516 --> 00:39:58,387
I do.

603
00:40:08,857 --> 00:40:10,454
Brooke, you’re home.

604
00:40:11,688 --> 00:40:13,342
Yeah, I’m grounded, remember?

605
00:40:14,177 --> 00:40:15,109
Not anymore.

606
00:40:15,959 --> 00:40:17,541
I think you’ve learned your lesson.

607
00:41:06,388 --> 00:41:09,315
You have one new message.

608
00:41:09,442 --> 00:41:10,695
Nathan, it’s me.

609
00:41:10,871 --> 00:41:13,874
I just needed to call because I want you to know-

610
00:41:14,015 --> 00:41:16,200
Message has been erased.

611
00:41:49,431 --> 00:41:50,612
Why didn’t you tell me?

612
00:41:50,962 --> 00:41:52,800
I knew you’d talk me out of it.

613
00:41:55,625 --> 00:41:56,650
So, where’s Jenny?

614
00:41:58,824 --> 00:41:59,722
She’s safe.

615
00:42:09,185 --> 00:42:10,372
I love you.

616
00:42:11,722 --> 00:42:12,885
I love you, too.

617
00:42:40,923 --> 00:42:44,512
