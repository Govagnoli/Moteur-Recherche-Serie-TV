1
00:00:00,333 --> 00:00:02,052
Previously on "One Tree Hill"...

2
00:00:02,118 --> 00:00:04,807
Well, well, well. Mayor Mullins.

3
00:00:04,861 --> 00:00:06,491
Drop your bid for reelection.

4
00:00:06,541 --> 00:00:08,415
You're gonna endorse me for mayor.

5
00:00:08,688 --> 00:00:12,589
Look, I-I don't want to be curious about you, but I can't help it, I am.

6
00:00:12,647 --> 00:00:15,589
Selfishly, I'm glad that's one battle you're losing.

7
00:00:15,651 --> 00:00:17,084
I'm just scared.

8
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:19,015
Haley's really hurting, Nathan.

9
00:00:19,066 --> 00:00:21,483
She hasn't written a song since you guys split up.

10
00:00:21,544 --> 00:00:23,962
So, what can Chris Keller do for you?

11
00:00:24,031 --> 00:00:26,039
He can help Haley with her music.

12
00:00:27,351 --> 00:00:28,607
Want to dance?

13
00:00:28,756 --> 00:00:30,568
Unless you're seeing someone.

14
00:00:30,572 --> 00:00:31,513
No.

15
00:00:31,697 --> 00:00:33,520
Not exclusively.

16
00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:24,449
Is everybody ready for Midnight Madness?

17
00:01:29,743 --> 00:01:32,180
That's what I'm talking about!

18
00:01:32,379 --> 00:01:35,104
The countdown to the start of the season is on.

19
00:01:35,165 --> 00:01:36,425
Let me hear you.

20
00:01:36,635 --> 00:01:39,108
5... 4...

21
00:01:39,158 --> 00:01:41,986
3... 2... 1!

22
00:01:42,047 --> 00:01:44,376
Let the madness begin!

23
00:02:21,209 --> 00:02:23,109
So, you gonna tell me what's going on with Haley?

24
00:02:24,291 --> 00:02:26,016
You're breaking her heart, you know that?

25
00:02:26,055 --> 00:02:29,136
Lucas, this is a pep rally. Where's your pep?

26
00:02:40,927 --> 00:02:42,489
She's your wife!

27
00:02:42,537 --> 00:02:45,458
And you treat her like this -- manipulating her, pushing her back to Chris?

28
00:02:45,509 --> 00:02:47,828
You need to back up... now.

29
00:02:47,901 --> 00:02:48,878
Really?

30
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,716
Is that an order... captain?

31
00:02:50,772 --> 00:02:51,771
Don't push me, bitch.

32
00:02:51,832 --> 00:02:54,909
Why? You gonna do something about it? You're a coward.

33
00:02:55,315 --> 00:02:56,671
You love Haley.

34
00:02:56,748 --> 00:03:00,762
But instead of dealing with it, 
you avoid her, treat her like dirt.

35
00:03:00,823 --> 00:03:04,182
God, I used to wonder why you did it, and then I realized something.

36
00:03:04,214 --> 00:03:05,288
Gonna bring out the team.

37
00:03:05,345 --> 00:03:08,361
You're just... like... Dan.

38
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:16,809
Now, the team that's gonna deliver us our state title, your Tree Hill Ravens!

39
00:03:28,753 --> 00:03:30,940
Damn your sperm, Danny.

40
00:03:36,397 --> 00:03:39,142
Lucas Scott throws a roundhouse to Nathan Scott's jaw.

41
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:42,102
It's just past 12:00, and all hell's broken loose!

42
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:45,879
Now this is truly Midnight Madness!

43
00:03:46,867 --> 00:03:47,775
Whoo!

44
00:03:52,976 --> 00:03:57,000
Announcer tryouts for the season. First official practice, midnight friday.

45
00:04:12,981 --> 00:04:13,845
Hey.

46
00:04:14,221 --> 00:04:15,717
I was hoping I'd catch you.

47
00:04:15,731 --> 00:04:16,800
Why is that?

48
00:04:17,034 --> 00:04:19,560
Uh, I don't know. I think we should talk.

49
00:04:19,681 --> 00:04:20,629
About what?

50
00:04:21,382 --> 00:04:24,229
Uh, what happened the other night at the masquerade ball.

51
00:04:24,653 --> 00:04:26,983
I can't. Whitey wants to see me before class.

52
00:04:27,049 --> 00:04:29,917
But it wasn't that big of a deal anyway.

53
00:04:30,015 --> 00:04:31,362
It was to me.

54
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:33,910
It was a nice moment, Haley. It's over now.

55
00:04:34,617 --> 00:04:35,597
I got to go.

56
00:04:41,526 --> 00:04:44,683
You know what hit me today? These are our last cheerleader tryouts ever.

57
00:04:44,739 --> 00:04:46,742
Yeah. I'm really broken up about it.

58
00:04:46,759 --> 00:04:49,516
Come on. How can you not love tryout day?

59
00:04:49,609 --> 00:04:53,377
Just the smell of it, like sports bras and desperation.

60
00:04:53,433 --> 00:04:57,510
Hmm. Speaking of desperate, how's life in the non-exclusive dating world?

61
00:04:57,576 --> 00:04:59,030
Lucas isn't playing fair.

62
00:04:59,112 --> 00:05:00,987
Maybe he's not playing at all.

63
00:05:01,077 --> 00:05:05,691
Exactly. I mean, unless you count him dancing with that slut at the masquerade ball,

64
00:05:05,732 --> 00:05:07,631
he's been totally monogamous.

65
00:05:07,697 --> 00:05:10,478
He knows the rules. 
Why can't he just follow them?

66
00:05:10,539 --> 00:05:11,779
Brooke, when are you gonna quit this crap

67
00:05:11,824 --> 00:05:15,107
and accept the fact that a really great guy wants to be with you?

68
00:05:15,178 --> 00:05:17,447
Nothing good can come of this, okay?

69
00:05:17,513 --> 00:05:20,318
What are you gonna do, force Lucas to go out and see other people?

70
00:05:21,701 --> 00:05:24,747
- P. Sawyer, you are a genius.
- That is not what I --

71
00:05:24,821 --> 00:05:29,130
Um, is this where we go for cheer tryouts?

72
00:05:30,246 --> 00:05:32,038
What tipped you off?

73
00:05:34,091 --> 00:05:35,972
Go, Ravens!

74
00:05:36,001 --> 00:05:37,425
We got spirit!

75
00:05:44,449 --> 00:05:46,370
Yeah! Go, team! Whoo!

76
00:05:47,302 --> 00:05:50,000
Let's... go... Ravens.

77
00:05:51,602 --> 00:05:53,841
What? What? What? What?

78
00:05:53,907 --> 00:05:56,196
What, what, what, what, what, what?

79
00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:58,178
Go, Ravens, go, Ravens, go!

80
00:06:06,739 --> 00:06:10,921
T.H.S. is number one. Yell "go!"

81
00:06:11,014 --> 00:06:13,999
T.H.S. is number one.

82
00:06:14,061 --> 00:06:16,082
Big blue! Ow!

83
00:06:16,108 --> 00:06:18,089
Oh, my god! Oh, my god.

84
00:06:18,207 --> 00:06:22,729
I'm fine. Seriously, I'm fine, but... 
does this mean I didn't get it?

85
00:06:23,548 --> 00:06:25,682
What part of this were we gonna miss again?

86
00:06:25,743 --> 00:06:28,652
One spot on the team and there's no one to fill it?

87
00:06:28,712 --> 00:06:31,816
It was like dance auditions for 
"crap: The musical."

88
00:06:33,445 --> 00:06:35,565
Sorry. Am I too late? I got lost.

89
00:06:35,636 --> 00:06:37,981
This new campus is totally confusing.

90
00:06:38,068 --> 00:06:39,184
I'm Rachel, by the way.

91
00:06:39,261 --> 00:06:39,987
R eally?

92
00:06:40,054 --> 00:06:41,549
I thought it was Pamela.

93
00:06:42,466 --> 00:06:44,621
Oh, right. The party.

94
00:06:44,683 --> 00:06:46,598
That guy wasn't your boyfriend, was he?

95
00:06:47,823 --> 00:06:51,529
Okay, you were late, 
now you're just wasting my time.

96
00:06:51,615 --> 00:06:53,392
Just hit your mark and I'll start the song.

97
00:06:53,465 --> 00:06:55,030
Actually, I brought my own song.

98
00:07:01,216 --> 00:07:02,326
Whenever you're ready.

99
00:08:06,108 --> 00:08:09,418
I'd like to thank you on behalf of myself and the group,

100
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:10,976
and I hope we passed the audition.

101
00:08:11,028 --> 00:08:11,836
I'm sorry, what?

102
00:08:11,888 --> 00:08:13,065
John Lennon.

103
00:08:13,488 --> 00:08:15,133
The "Let it be" album.

104
00:08:15,354 --> 00:08:16,903
Girl knows her music.

105
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:19,204
Too bad she was late.

106
00:08:19,305 --> 00:08:22,172
Sorry. Betty, was it? We'll be in touch.

107
00:08:22,234 --> 00:08:24,847
It's Rachel, and I hope so.

108
00:08:29,643 --> 00:08:31,707
So... guess we found our girl, right?

109
00:08:31,758 --> 00:08:34,232
You just like her 'cause of that stupid Bee Gees thing.

110
00:08:34,292 --> 00:08:37,390
No. I like her because she's good.

111
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:42,194
You wanted to see me, coach?

112
00:08:42,249 --> 00:08:43,806
Nathan, good timing.

113
00:08:44,046 --> 00:08:46,621
Look at this -- triangle offense.

114
00:08:46,677 --> 00:08:48,245
It all runs through to you.

115
00:08:48,301 --> 00:08:49,381
I'm ready, coach.

116
00:08:49,448 --> 00:08:50,758
I know you are.

117
00:08:51,265 --> 00:08:55,971
It might not come as a surprise, 
but I'm making it official.

118
00:08:56,053 --> 00:08:59,520
I'm making you captain of this year's squad.

119
00:08:59,622 --> 00:09:00,912
I  don't know what to say.

120
00:09:00,918 --> 00:09:03,328
Nothing to say. You've earned it.

121
00:09:04,055 --> 00:09:08,152
Well, in that case, I promise to do whatever I can to get you that championship.

122
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:12,176
Nathan, I appreciate that, 
but if we get that far,

123
00:09:12,242 --> 00:09:15,176
that trophy belongs to the team. It's not mine.

124
00:09:15,247 --> 00:09:16,845
Team unity.

125
00:09:17,536 --> 00:09:20,116
That's the captain's responsibility.

126
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:28,648
So, I've been thinking about our whole nonexclusive thing,

127
00:09:28,703 --> 00:09:31,827
and about how you haven't been holding up your end of the bargain.

128
00:09:31,884 --> 00:09:33,629
I didn't know it was a requirement.

129
00:09:33,727 --> 00:09:36,808
Lucas, in order for this to work, 
there has to be a balance.

130
00:09:36,881 --> 00:09:38,682
I kiss a guy, you kiss a girl.

131
00:09:38,748 --> 00:09:41,520
- I kiss two guys...
- I kiss you twice.

132
00:09:41,591 --> 00:09:43,353
You kiss someone else.

133
00:09:43,756 --> 00:09:48,866
Which is why I'm gonna pick a girl for you, say somebody like... her.

134
00:09:49,548 --> 00:09:52,716
'Kay, go ask her out. Go on.

135
00:09:54,504 --> 00:09:56,179
Really, you want me to ask her out?

136
00:09:56,210 --> 00:09:57,224
Yeah.

137
00:09:57,398 --> 00:09:58,252
You're sure?

138
00:09:58,303 --> 00:10:00,299
I'm sure. She's the one.

139
00:10:05,010 --> 00:10:06,143
Okay.

140
00:10:06,317 --> 00:10:07,902
If you insist.

141
00:10:25,842 --> 00:10:28,321
- Want that autographed? 
- God.

142
00:10:28,419 --> 00:10:30,252
I knew you'd be happy to see me.

143
00:10:30,779 --> 00:10:34,261
So... how's married life?

144
00:10:35,311 --> 00:10:37,039
What are you doing here, Chris?

145
00:10:37,111 --> 00:10:41,237
Truthfully, I was thinking maybe you and me should work together again.

146
00:10:41,556 --> 00:10:42,748
Are you kidding me?

147
00:10:42,802 --> 00:10:46,566
Come on. You know Chris Keller... Sorry.

148
00:10:46,651 --> 00:10:50,886
Haley, you and I made great music together, remember?

149
00:10:50,947 --> 00:10:53,794
Yeah, I remember exactly what happened. Do you?

150
00:10:53,871 --> 00:10:56,929
So, things weren't always easy, but if you just set that other crap aside --

151
00:10:56,988 --> 00:10:59,298
The other crap was my marriage, Chris.

152
00:10:59,377 --> 00:11:00,752
Details, Haley.

153
00:11:01,488 --> 00:11:03,973
Come on... me and you.

154
00:11:04,306 --> 00:11:05,913
Just music.

155
00:11:06,805 --> 00:11:08,156
What do you say?

156
00:11:12,176 --> 00:11:13,429
She said no?

157
00:11:13,512 --> 00:11:14,930
Among other things.

158
00:11:14,991 --> 00:11:17,260
Your girl has a real potty mouth when she wants to.

159
00:11:17,325 --> 00:11:18,754
You just gave up?

160
00:11:18,965 --> 00:11:20,399
You didn't so easily last time.

161
00:11:20,464 --> 00:11:22,850
Whoa, whoa. That's unfair.

162
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:24,601
And entirely correct.

163
00:11:24,617 --> 00:11:27,941
Listen, you know I don't like to get in the middle of other people's relationships.

164
00:11:28,697 --> 00:11:32,460
But Haley wants you. I don't get it. Why is it so important that she and I work together?

165
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:33,756
I have my reasons.

166
00:11:35,722 --> 00:11:37,181
You want to share them with me?

167
00:11:39,634 --> 00:11:42,040
Haley's music was a big part of her life.

168
00:11:42,122 --> 00:11:43,428
Without it, she's just not Haley.

169
00:11:43,494 --> 00:11:45,298
She gets music back, you get her back?

170
00:11:45,363 --> 00:11:47,257
No. It's not about that.

171
00:11:47,334 --> 00:11:48,521
This is about Haley.

172
00:11:48,577 --> 00:11:51,123
It doesn't matter, anyway. She's not gonna go for it.

173
00:11:51,199 --> 00:11:52,471
We'll see about that.

174
00:11:53,596 --> 00:11:55,034
Whatever you say.

175
00:11:56,652 --> 00:11:58,681
So, we make a pretty good team, you and me.

176
00:11:58,736 --> 00:12:00,257
A team? You and me?

177
00:12:00,318 --> 00:12:02,366
What, you don't think I got game?

178
00:12:03,233 --> 00:12:03,995
Come on.

179
00:12:11,225 --> 00:12:12,202
Aw!

180
00:12:12,734 --> 00:12:14,235
How do you know I wasn't aiming there?

181
00:12:15,535 --> 00:12:16,514
See you, partner.

182
00:12:23,129 --> 00:12:25,182
He's running for mayor?

183
00:12:25,647 --> 00:12:27,326
That  conniving skunk.

184
00:12:28,463 --> 00:12:31,352
Do you realize the amount of control the mayor has?

185
00:12:31,439 --> 00:12:33,518
The police department, the zoning commission,

186
00:12:33,588 --> 00:12:36,194
not to mention veto power over city council.

187
00:12:36,262 --> 00:12:38,611
I was going to tell you, Karen.

188
00:12:39,021 --> 00:12:42,527
To be honest, when Dan first brought it up, I thought he was joking.

189
00:12:42,993 --> 00:12:44,888
I mean, he's running unopposed.

190
00:12:44,970 --> 00:12:47,699
Then we're gonna have to find somebody who can beat him.

191
00:12:48,298 --> 00:12:50,459
You know, I'd love to help, but...

192
00:12:50,592 --> 00:12:52,421
my hands are tied.

193
00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:57,084
I made a deal with the devil that I'd stand by his side through this election.

194
00:12:59,602 --> 00:13:01,272
In exchange for what?

195
00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:02,624
A divorce.

196
00:13:02,818 --> 00:13:04,872
Freedom for Nathan, for me.

197
00:13:05,599 --> 00:13:08,338
Trust me, it was an offer too good to refuse.

198
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:09,459
Sure.

199
00:13:10,043 --> 00:13:16,121
But, you know, I can still make things difficult for him.

200
00:13:19,626 --> 00:13:21,646
The billboards look great.

201
00:13:21,906 --> 00:13:24,825
Tv ads air next week.

202
00:13:24,907 --> 00:13:28,782
And, thanks to a well-timed donation, the high school's generously agreed

203
00:13:28,823 --> 00:13:33,180
to officially retire my jersey this friday night at Midnight Madness.

204
00:13:33,263 --> 00:13:35,173
Which brings me to my platform --

205
00:13:35,306 --> 00:13:38,737
"family first," 
a return to traditional values.

206
00:13:38,829 --> 00:13:42,413
Safer streets, better schools, 
neighborhood-watch programs,

207
00:13:42,479 --> 00:13:46,806
a new-and-improved mass-transit system, parents as role models...

208
00:13:48,465 --> 00:13:52,042
I'm so sorry, Dan. 
I didn't know we had company.

209
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:56,140
Mm, can you see my ass through this?

210
00:13:56,648 --> 00:13:59,145
Deb, honey, it's a little early to be drinking, don't you think?

211
00:13:59,213 --> 00:14:02,012
Oh, come on! 
It's noon somewhere, right?

212
00:14:03,549 --> 00:14:04,690
Cheers.

213
00:14:13,551 --> 00:14:15,652
Okay, we're done.

214
00:14:15,852 --> 00:14:17,967
Do you see how the tendrils frame her face?

215
00:14:18,044 --> 00:14:20,117
Oh, my god, I look so hot.

216
00:14:20,675 --> 00:14:24,192
Thanks, Rach'. God, you rock.

217
00:14:24,276 --> 00:14:26,235
No,  Bev, you rock.

218
00:14:33,654 --> 00:14:34,802
Hey, boyfriend.

219
00:14:34,889 --> 00:14:35,491
Hey.

220
00:14:35,574 --> 00:14:36,736
Are we still on for tonight?

221
00:14:36,819 --> 00:14:38,405
Yeah, about that...

222
00:14:39,005 --> 00:14:40,320
here's the thing --

223
00:14:40,904 --> 00:14:44,837
when I asked you out, 
it was just to make Brooke jealous.

224
00:14:47,496 --> 00:14:48,492
I see.

225
00:14:48,585 --> 00:14:52,082
So, um, basically you just took advantage of the new girl.

226
00:14:52,158 --> 00:14:53,244
Dude, that's just wrong.

227
00:14:53,306 --> 00:14:54,238
I'm sorry.

228
00:14:54,314 --> 00:14:57,684
Lucky for you, I'm into wrong. My address.

229
00:14:59,708 --> 00:15:01,190
Pick me up at 8:00.

230
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:14,646
Yummy.

231
00:15:23,862 --> 00:15:27,845
Tomorrow's Midnight Madness, so practice doesn't officially start till then.

232
00:15:27,911 --> 00:15:29,944
That  doesn't mean we can't get a head start.

233
00:15:30,027 --> 00:15:31,242
Aye, aye, captain!

234
00:15:33,067 --> 00:15:36,247
So, today, we're gonna run full court for 30.

235
00:15:36,732 --> 00:15:38,151
Uh, captain Scott.

236
00:15:38,218 --> 00:15:39,637
It's just Nathan, Tim.

237
00:15:39,704 --> 00:15:43,041
Captain Nathan, has it occurred to you to appoint a vice-captain in the event

238
00:15:43,088 --> 00:15:46,017
that you're assassinated or smash up another race car?

239
00:15:46,083 --> 00:15:47,143
No.

240
00:15:47,225 --> 00:15:49,345
All right, I've already split up the teams. You guys know who you are.

241
00:15:49,362 --> 00:15:51,218
Everybody else just rotate in.

242
00:15:51,295 --> 00:15:54,700
Yeah, about that, I notice you've got both centers.

243
00:15:54,746 --> 00:15:56,851
How about we take Herro?

244
00:15:56,927 --> 00:16:00,030
Great idea Lucas. Maybe when you're captain, we can try that.

245
00:16:01,090 --> 00:16:04,699
In fact, why don't you just go ahead and sit this one out, all right?

246
00:16:06,671 --> 00:16:07,530
You're kidding.

247
00:16:07,593 --> 00:16:11,354
No, I'm captain, and if you can't handle that, you can leave.

248
00:16:13,424 --> 00:16:16,225
Fede, you're in. Let's go.

249
00:16:37,928 --> 00:16:39,669
Did I miss the tryouts?

250
00:16:39,736 --> 00:16:42,505
Um, everyone missed the tryouts.

251
00:16:42,890 --> 00:16:44,952
- Why, you interested?
- Uh-huh.

252
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,351
Okay. What's your name?

253
00:16:46,367 --> 00:16:48,383
- Gigi.
- Okay, Gigi.

254
00:16:48,444 --> 00:16:51,286
Do you have any prior experience announcing basketball?

255
00:16:52,202 --> 00:16:55,096
I see. So you're just a big fan of the game.

256
00:16:58,443 --> 00:17:01,915
Gigi, you do realize this is a job where you talk...

257
00:17:02,301 --> 00:17:03,953
about basketball.

258
00:17:06,713 --> 00:17:08,064
I'll be in touch.

259
00:17:13,047 --> 00:17:14,297
- Here you go. 
- Thank you.

260
00:17:14,869 --> 00:17:16,220
You, too, huh?

261
00:17:17,127 --> 00:17:18,249
Don't freak.

262
00:17:18,448 --> 00:17:21,442
I'm pretty sure taste in coffee drinks isn't hereditary.

263
00:17:22,673 --> 00:17:24,618
I was hoping I'd run into you.

264
00:17:24,797 --> 00:17:27,705
I mean, considering you've been lurking outside my motel room.

265
00:17:27,786 --> 00:17:29,569
Uh, yeah, I'm really sorry about that.

266
00:17:29,641 --> 00:17:32,298
It's okay. I would've come out and offered you a soda.

267
00:17:32,605 --> 00:17:35,671
The last thing I want to do is complicate your life.

268
00:17:37,099 --> 00:17:39,256
Well, I probably better go --

269
00:17:39,307 --> 00:17:41,677
You know, there's this lunchtime concert,

270
00:17:41,741 --> 00:17:44,634
this guy doing ska covers of Neil Diamond songs.

271
00:17:44,646 --> 00:17:47,253
Ooh. That sounds... awful.

272
00:17:47,262 --> 00:17:49,057
Yeah, I thought so, too.

273
00:17:49,363 --> 00:17:50,899
So, you want to check it out?

274
00:17:51,231 --> 00:17:52,266
Yeah.

275
00:17:57,570 --> 00:18:02,311
Okay, so, wait, you're saying that you were actually conceived at Woodstock?

276
00:18:02,570 --> 00:18:06,617
That's what my parents say... 
but their math's a little off.

277
00:18:06,679 --> 00:18:08,344
They were pretty big hippies, though.

278
00:18:08,405 --> 00:18:10,217
Got a picture of them somewhere.

279
00:18:24,175 --> 00:18:27,072
Bear in mind, this was taken awhile ago, but...

280
00:18:28,398 --> 00:18:29,264
God.

281
00:18:29,325 --> 00:18:30,288
What the hell is this?

282
00:18:30,417 --> 00:18:31,834
It's an article I wrote.

283
00:18:31,895 --> 00:18:33,825
- For what, "lying bitch monthly"? 
- Peyton!

284
00:18:33,892 --> 00:18:36,970
You said you wanted to get to know me. You said that there wasn't any article.

285
00:18:37,046 --> 00:18:38,761
There wasn't... at the time.

286
00:18:38,822 --> 00:18:43,813
You also said that you don't draw, but, really, Ellie, this looks a hell of a lot like me.

287
00:18:43,871 --> 00:18:46,012
If you would just listen, I can explain.

288
00:18:46,066 --> 00:18:47,829
You know what? Don't bother.

289
00:18:47,988 --> 00:18:50,256
In fact, I've got a headline for your article.

290
00:18:50,302 --> 00:18:51,622
It's called "go to hell."

291
00:18:59,434 --> 00:19:01,632
I just had a great idea.

292
00:19:01,694 --> 00:19:03,655
Does it involve trigonometry?

293
00:19:04,009 --> 00:19:05,990
I don't know what that is, so I doubt it.

294
00:19:06,076 --> 00:19:08,969
You are gonna be a cheerleader.

295
00:19:10,829 --> 00:19:11,693
What?

296
00:19:11,766 --> 00:19:14,345
I know! It's sudden, right? 
But I was thinking,

297
00:19:14,401 --> 00:19:17,028
you did such a great job filling in at last year's tournament,

298
00:19:17,074 --> 00:19:19,847
that why not do the same thing this year, only permanently?

299
00:19:19,906 --> 00:19:21,365
Thanks, but I'll pass.

300
00:19:21,441 --> 00:19:23,689
Come on. You're my roommate.

301
00:19:23,742 --> 00:19:25,159
You're supposed to have my back.

302
00:19:25,215 --> 00:19:27,944
That Rachel girl, she's stealing my life.

303
00:19:28,006 --> 00:19:32,143
She's dating Lucas, which, okay, 
I accidentally orchestrated,

304
00:19:32,199 --> 00:19:34,733
but my entire squad has a girl-crush on her.

305
00:19:34,795 --> 00:19:36,992
Basically, if you do not cheer, I'm screwed.

306
00:19:37,048 --> 00:19:39,803
Brooke, I have a lot going on in my life right now.

307
00:19:39,899 --> 00:19:43,136
Nathan's being all hot and cold, 
and now with Chris back in town...

308
00:19:44,595 --> 00:19:46,003
Oh, my god.

309
00:19:46,095 --> 00:19:46,780
What?

310
00:19:46,847 --> 00:19:49,843
Oh, that's totally it. That's exactly why Nathan's acting so weird.

311
00:19:49,854 --> 00:19:53,099
He knows Chris is back in town. He thinks I had something to do with it.

312
00:19:53,232 --> 00:19:56,079
Oh, yeah. Great.

313
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:58,245
We've solved your riddle. 
Can we please get back to mine?

314
00:19:58,311 --> 00:19:59,207
Give me an "H"!

315
00:19:59,268 --> 00:20:00,257
I can't!

316
00:20:00,317 --> 00:20:04,251
You can! I thought your goal was to be with Nathan. You'd be with him all the time.

317
00:20:04,306 --> 00:20:07,830
- Pep rallies and away games --
- I know. I get it. I just...

318
00:20:07,876 --> 00:20:10,303
I think that if I join the cheerleading squad, Nathan would see it

319
00:20:10,353 --> 00:20:13,129
as some pathetic attempt to get close to him.

320
00:20:13,190 --> 00:20:16,432
That's funny. It seems to me like worrying about what Nathan thinks is pathetic

321
00:20:16,503 --> 00:20:19,237
is actually pretty pathetic. 
Forget about Nathan.

322
00:20:19,289 --> 00:20:21,592
Why don't you do what you want for once?

323
00:20:21,648 --> 00:20:24,213
Okay, I will. No, thanks.

324
00:20:24,710 --> 00:20:25,984
Let me rephrase that.

325
00:20:26,047 --> 00:20:29,539
Why don't you just do what I want for once?

326
00:20:31,008 --> 00:20:32,591
Come on.

327
00:20:35,847 --> 00:20:36,813
Fine.

328
00:20:37,163 --> 00:20:37,966
Oh.

329
00:20:38,334 --> 00:20:41,950
Did I mention that Nathan's very often shirtless at practice?

330
00:20:42,007 --> 00:20:47,279
You know, taut, sweaty, 
and bulging in all the right places.

331
00:20:48,298 --> 00:20:49,859
All the girls notice.

332
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:50,868
Hmm.

333
00:20:51,062 --> 00:20:52,184
Okay, see ya.

334
00:20:53,086 --> 00:20:53,904
Ah!

335
00:21:23,868 --> 00:21:25,286
You don't give up, do you?

336
00:21:25,342 --> 00:21:28,758
Peyton, I had to explain. 
I couldn't leave things like that.

337
00:21:30,698 --> 00:21:33,022
Maybe if you'd just read the article.

338
00:21:33,943 --> 00:21:36,807
Fine. Come in. 
I've got something for you.

339
00:21:43,636 --> 00:21:46,523
I'm a writer, Peyton. 
It's a big part of my life.

340
00:21:46,605 --> 00:21:49,493
But I never meant to hurt you. 
And the fact that you even think --

341
00:21:49,555 --> 00:21:51,045
You want to know what I think?

342
00:21:52,335 --> 00:21:56,225
I think you're just a lying junkie who probably doesn't even have cancer.

343
00:22:04,107 --> 00:22:06,113
Oh. I see.

344
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:10,415
So, this relationship that we have, 
if you can call it that,

345
00:22:10,471 --> 00:22:14,966
you can use it for your podcasts and your drawings, but I can't write about it.

346
00:22:17,071 --> 00:22:18,734
Just get out, Ellie --

347
00:22:18,832 --> 00:22:21,141
out of my house, out of my town...

348
00:22:21,448 --> 00:22:22,707
and out of my life.

349
00:22:26,194 --> 00:22:27,301
Okay.

350
00:22:28,621 --> 00:22:29,712
I will.

351
00:22:32,042 --> 00:22:33,541
But know this, Peyton...

352
00:22:35,549 --> 00:22:36,578
your trust...

353
00:22:37,407 --> 00:22:40,104
was always more important to me than any article.

354
00:22:40,791 --> 00:22:42,528
You may not believe that...

355
00:22:46,316 --> 00:22:47,781
...but it's the truth.

356
00:23:07,994 --> 00:23:09,438
Damn it, Dan.

357
00:23:10,816 --> 00:23:11,921
What are you doing?

358
00:23:12,547 --> 00:23:17,164
Well, in the spirit of your little fashion show earlier, I decided to take up photography.

359
00:23:17,258 --> 00:23:21,004
I call this exhibit "Deb's toothbrush."

360
00:23:21,655 --> 00:23:22,745
Let's see.

361
00:23:23,094 --> 00:23:26,048
Here's me armor-alling the tires...

362
00:23:26,395 --> 00:23:27,983
with your toothbrush.

363
00:23:29,646 --> 00:23:31,506
Scrubbing the toilet.

364
00:23:33,335 --> 00:23:35,028
The neighbors' dog.

365
00:23:36,165 --> 00:23:38,792
Oh, and my favorite.

366
00:23:38,925 --> 00:23:41,377
Here's your toothbrush up the dog's...

367
00:23:50,573 --> 00:23:54,686
So, basically, the plan is to parade me around in front of Brooke,

368
00:23:54,739 --> 00:23:58,960
rubbing  her nose in the fact that you're out with an extremely hot girl who isn't her.

369
00:23:59,026 --> 00:24:00,321
Yeah, pretty much.

370
00:24:00,397 --> 00:24:02,636
Cool. Just show me where she works.

371
00:24:05,355 --> 00:24:07,535
Oh. Perfect timing.

372
00:24:10,397 --> 00:24:11,840
Do you think it's working?

373
00:24:13,843 --> 00:24:15,026
Oh, yeah.

374
00:24:15,343 --> 00:24:16,603
But we can do better.

375
00:24:17,121 --> 00:24:19,548
Whoa, I think this is a bad idea.

376
00:24:22,558 --> 00:24:24,969
Welcome to Suburban Filth. Can I help you?

377
00:24:25,035 --> 00:24:28,215
Yes. We're looking for some lingerie --

378
00:24:28,298 --> 00:24:31,800
something lacy, open-cup,

379
00:24:31,988 --> 00:24:34,042
possibly edible.

380
00:24:35,187 --> 00:24:38,015
Okay, joke's over, Rachel. Let's go.

381
00:24:38,097 --> 00:24:40,283
You know, I think you're in the wrong store.

382
00:24:40,354 --> 00:24:43,641
You're looking for slut barn, downstairs.

383
00:24:45,999 --> 00:24:47,410
These'll do.

384
00:24:47,482 --> 00:24:49,848
Oh, and I need a pair for my sister.

385
00:24:49,924 --> 00:24:53,587
She's kind of chubby -- 
you know, your size.

386
00:24:55,091 --> 00:24:58,485
Either you take her out that door or I'm gonna put her through the window.

387
00:24:58,531 --> 00:25:02,044
Okay, look, I'm sorry. I messed up.

388
00:25:02,448 --> 00:25:03,754
But you're the one who told me to see other --

389
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:05,873
Now, Lucas.

390
00:25:07,759 --> 00:25:08,853
Let's go, Rachel.

391
00:25:09,381 --> 00:25:10,962
Yeah, okay.

392
00:25:13,056 --> 00:25:15,621
Service here sucks donkeys, anyway.

393
00:25:37,383 --> 00:25:41,416
Hey. I-I wasn't expecting you. Come on in.

394
00:25:42,969 --> 00:25:44,550
I can't stay. I just, uh --

395
00:25:44,751 --> 00:25:46,189
there's something I wanted to talk to you about.

396
00:25:46,275 --> 00:25:47,116
Chris.

397
00:25:47,192 --> 00:25:47,935
How'd you know?

398
00:25:48,011 --> 00:25:50,776
Please, with all this weirdness between us, I just figured --

399
00:25:51,007 --> 00:25:54,057
Nathan, I didn't know he was coming back into town. You have to believe me.

400
00:25:54,114 --> 00:25:55,963
I would never work with him again.

401
00:25:56,029 --> 00:25:57,703
Actually, I think you should.

402
00:25:58,067 --> 00:25:59,490
You what?

403
00:25:59,814 --> 00:26:03,274
He's good for your music, Haley, and that's what you should be focusing on.

404
00:26:03,336 --> 00:26:06,612
Nathan, working with Chris nearly killed our marriage.

405
00:26:06,674 --> 00:26:08,137
Do you remember how jealous you were?

406
00:26:08,205 --> 00:26:10,781
Yeah, and that's just it.

407
00:26:10,924 --> 00:26:13,586
I told you I needed to be able to trust you again.

408
00:26:13,692 --> 00:26:14,922
This is your chance.

409
00:26:15,010 --> 00:26:16,458
So this is like a test?

410
00:26:16,530 --> 00:26:17,923
You can call it what you want.

411
00:26:17,993 --> 00:26:20,893
But if you work with Chris and you end up having feelings for him again,

412
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,219
I guess I'll have my answer.

413
00:26:22,242 --> 00:26:24,625
That's ridiculous! 
Nathan, that's not fair.

414
00:26:24,691 --> 00:26:25,981
Maybe not.

415
00:26:26,166 --> 00:26:29,125
But, like I said, it's your chance.

416
00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:21,518
Oh, Dan Scott for mayor.

417
00:27:21,713 --> 00:27:22,783
Appreciate your vote.

418
00:27:23,382 --> 00:27:25,789
Vote for Dan Scott. Dan Scott for mayor.

419
00:27:27,804 --> 00:27:28,804
Hey, Nathan.

420
00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:30,320
Big night, huh?

421
00:27:30,417 --> 00:27:33,740
Yeah. I see you've managed to make it about yourself.

422
00:27:34,026 --> 00:27:36,013
Come on, son. Don't be jealous.

423
00:27:36,096 --> 00:27:37,692
It's unbecoming to a captain.

424
00:27:38,497 --> 00:27:39,485
And frankly...

425
00:27:40,458 --> 00:27:42,091
it makes you look like a tool.

426
00:27:51,542 --> 00:27:52,413
Nathan.

427
00:27:54,153 --> 00:27:55,101
You okay?

428
00:27:55,332 --> 00:27:58,573
Yeah. My dad just ruins my life.

429
00:27:58,767 --> 00:28:01,834
Pretty soon he'll be mayor and he can ruine verybody else's, too.

430
00:28:07,008 --> 00:28:08,941
Here you go. Dan Scott for mayor.

431
00:28:12,744 --> 00:28:16,441
We go on in 10 minutes. 
Where is everybody?

432
00:28:16,492 --> 00:28:19,360
Brooke, chill. They're gonna be here.

433
00:28:22,687 --> 00:28:26,082
Where the hell have you been? 
You almost missed the routine.

434
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:27,531
Sorry, Brooke.

435
00:28:27,643 --> 00:28:31,053
I treated the team to a little preshow beverage.

436
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:32,077
Brought you one.

437
00:28:32,144 --> 00:28:33,598
No, thanks.

438
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:35,109
Brooke, relax. It's okay.

439
00:28:35,175 --> 00:28:36,799
No, it is not okay.

440
00:28:37,833 --> 00:28:40,572
First of all, this is my squad.

441
00:28:40,653 --> 00:28:41,946
Second -- 

442
00:28:44,653 --> 00:28:46,946
Bevin, where are your cheer bloomers?

443
00:28:47,601 --> 00:28:48,994
I'm trying something new.

444
00:28:50,325 --> 00:28:53,832
Okay, this squad is out of control, and it is your fault.

445
00:28:53,893 --> 00:28:55,394
What are you gonna do, fire me?

446
00:28:55,881 --> 00:28:56,654
Hi.

447
00:28:58,824 --> 00:29:00,197
Nice outfit.

448
00:29:00,929 --> 00:29:05,234
Well, then, that's it. Get out.

449
00:29:06,253 --> 00:29:07,693
You can't be serious.

450
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:10,898
Oh, it's real. Check your pompons at the door.

451
00:29:12,634 --> 00:29:14,226
I don't know what to say.

452
00:29:14,309 --> 00:29:16,627
But if that's what everyone wants...

453
00:29:16,703 --> 00:29:17,852
- No.
- No.

454
00:29:17,938 --> 00:29:19,874
Brooke, Rachel's the best cheerleader we've got.

455
00:29:20,037 --> 00:29:22,745
If we want a shot at state, we need her.

456
00:29:22,919 --> 00:29:27,584
Look, I make the rules, and I say Haley's in.

457
00:29:27,653 --> 00:29:30,769
And besides, the routine won't even work with an extra person.

458
00:29:31,322 --> 00:29:33,302
Sure it will. Won't it, girls?

459
00:29:33,370 --> 00:29:34,224
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

460
00:29:34,287 --> 00:29:37,067
I'll be up front, and Haley is in.

461
00:29:37,153 --> 00:29:39,177
Just watch me for the changes.

462
00:29:39,473 --> 00:29:41,644
Come on, girls. Let's go stretch.

463
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:50,813
Okay, what the hell just happened?

464
00:29:55,513 --> 00:29:57,008
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

465
00:29:57,065 --> 00:29:59,712
Mouth McFadden coming to you from the Tree Hill gym

466
00:29:59,763 --> 00:30:04,208
where, in minutes, perhaps the most promising team in Ravens history will take the floor.

467
00:30:04,264 --> 00:30:07,730
With me tonight is my new color announcer, Gigi Silveri.

468
00:30:07,874 --> 00:30:10,694
Gigi, how would you describe the excitement here?

469
00:30:13,186 --> 00:30:14,515
Okay, then.

470
00:30:14,551 --> 00:30:17,329
And coach Whitey Durham is stepping to center court.

471
00:30:21,489 --> 00:30:24,549
Welcome to Midnight Madness!

472
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:32,993
All right.

473
00:30:33,341 --> 00:30:36,653
I'm gonna bring out the cheerleaders in a minute, but first,

474
00:30:36,704 --> 00:30:40,647
we've got some business we've got to tend to.

475
00:30:40,804 --> 00:30:45,828
20 years ago, we had a player, one of the most talented I've ever coached.

476
00:30:46,073 --> 00:30:51,424
Dan Scott scored a lot of points for this team, got a lot of rebounds.

477
00:30:51,502 --> 00:30:54,882
After that, he sold a lot of automobiles.

478
00:30:54,947 --> 00:30:59,953
And I'm sure, in the upcoming election, he's gonna get a lot of votes...

479
00:31:01,077 --> 00:31:02,724
just not mine.

480
00:31:05,304 --> 00:31:06,990
Dan, come up here.

481
00:31:17,891 --> 00:31:23,241
Now, I thought that some years ago we'd retired this jersey, but...

482
00:31:24,133 --> 00:31:27,685
What the hell? Unveil the damn thing.

483
00:31:35,915 --> 00:31:37,637
Whitey Durham, everybody.

484
00:31:38,043 --> 00:31:39,082
Class act.

485
00:31:46,739 --> 00:31:48,995
It's an honor to be here tonight.

486
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:53,009
Looking around this gym sure brings back a lot of memories.

487
00:31:54,654 --> 00:31:56,649
I played my heart out for those teams,

488
00:31:56,706 --> 00:32:00,878
and I plan to put forth that same effort as your mayor.

489
00:32:00,957 --> 00:32:04,313
Lord, lord, where's Lee Harvey Oswald when we need him?

490
00:32:04,376 --> 00:32:09,869
And since I'm running unopposed, a vote for Dan Scott is not only the smart choice...

491
00:32:10,432 --> 00:32:12,848
it's the only choice!

492
00:32:13,862 --> 00:32:14,928
Thank you.

493
00:32:22,194 --> 00:32:25,408
Thank you, Danny. 
That was a fine speech.

494
00:32:25,485 --> 00:32:28,706
However, you made one small error.

495
00:32:28,793 --> 00:32:32,929
I've just been told you'll be running opposed after all.

496
00:32:33,062 --> 00:32:38,466
Ladies and gentlemen, the candidate that I'm endorsing, Ms. Karen Roe.

497
00:33:07,521 --> 00:33:12,856
Is everybody ready for Midnight Madness?

498
00:33:13,404 --> 00:33:15,616
That's what I'm talking about!

499
00:33:15,907 --> 00:33:18,764
The countdown to the start of the season is on.

500
00:33:18,832 --> 00:33:19,966
Let me hear you.

501
00:33:20,054 --> 00:33:22,685
5... 4...

502
00:33:22,784 --> 00:33:25,697
3... 2... 1!

503
00:33:25,709 --> 00:33:27,919
Let the madness begin!

504
00:33:39,634 --> 00:33:42,982
Brooke Davis and the squad already in mid-season form.

505
00:33:43,069 --> 00:33:46,924
And the newest cheerleaders, Haley James Scott and Rachel Gattina.

506
00:33:48,705 --> 00:33:50,098
Showtime.

507
00:34:02,715 --> 00:34:04,917
- Don't push me, bitch.
- Don't push me, bitch.

508
00:34:04,972 --> 00:34:06,426
Why? You gonna do something about it?

509
00:34:06,478 --> 00:34:07,881
I'm just getting started.

510
00:34:18,377 --> 00:34:21,516
Cool it. This isn't the pole dancing you do on weekends.

511
00:34:24,402 --> 00:34:28,207
Well, the new girl sure has a lot of... spirit.

512
00:34:44,975 --> 00:34:46,876
What is your problem?

513
00:34:47,341 --> 00:34:48,878
You're the one with the problem.

514
00:34:48,939 --> 00:34:50,259
You dance like a cripple.

515
00:34:50,326 --> 00:34:53,439
Nice splits, though. You must have a lot of practice spreading your legs.

516
00:34:53,516 --> 00:34:56,609
I also have a lot of practice making a fist. You wanna see?

517
00:34:56,682 --> 00:35:01,278
Brooke, you don't scare me. I mean, it's not like I'm a cookie or a doughnut.

518
00:35:03,203 --> 00:35:07,208
Now, the team that's gonna deliver us our state title...

519
00:35:07,259 --> 00:35:10,367
You're just... like... Dan.

520
00:35:13,669 --> 00:35:16,127
...Your Tree Hill Ravens!

521
00:35:24,590 --> 00:35:25,732
What happened?

522
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:27,155
Who knows?

523
00:35:27,283 --> 00:35:29,812
Maybe somebody was being a full-on diva skank.

524
00:35:29,905 --> 00:35:30,882
You'd know.

525
00:35:34,814 --> 00:35:36,832
You just bought yourself a nose job.

526
00:35:55,679 --> 00:35:59,012
Lucas Scott throws a roundhouse to Nathan Scott's jaw.

527
00:35:59,571 --> 00:36:03,226
And over on the other side, 
Brooke Davis is choking the new girl.

528
00:36:03,317 --> 00:36:06,205
There's a hair pull. Oh, an eye gouge.

529
00:36:06,312 --> 00:36:08,909
Oh, there's a painful shot to the groin.

530
00:36:09,027 --> 00:36:12,272
Now this is truly Midnight Madness!

531
00:36:12,382 --> 00:36:14,521
Gigi, I don't suppose you have anything to add?

532
00:36:14,598 --> 00:36:17,372
Actually, this -- this kind of turns me on.

533
00:36:30,449 --> 00:36:35,083
Never in my 40-some years of coaching

534
00:36:35,170 --> 00:36:38,631
have I been so embarrassed by my players!

535
00:36:39,474 --> 00:36:43,111
What in the hell did I tell you about team unity?

536
00:36:44,464 --> 00:36:45,585
I'm sorry, coach.

537
00:36:45,681 --> 00:36:49,788
I ought to come over there and rip that captain's patch off that jersey!

538
00:36:51,041 --> 00:36:52,398
But I'm not gonna do it.

539
00:36:57,458 --> 00:36:58,492
I don't get it.

540
00:36:58,562 --> 00:37:00,821
I'm making you cocaptains.

541
00:37:00,893 --> 00:37:05,578
God knows neither one of you deserve it, but this is our last season,

542
00:37:05,942 --> 00:37:10,181
and you two are either gonna make this work or tear it down!

543
00:37:10,688 --> 00:37:13,986
Either way, you're gonna do it together!

544
00:37:19,889 --> 00:37:21,875
So, what's the "C" stand for?

545
00:37:22,115 --> 00:37:27,180
'Cause if it's chastity, 
I'm definitely in the wrong car.

546
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,520
It was a crazy night, huh?

547
00:37:29,811 --> 00:37:32,454
I thought you might be up for a little more fun.

548
00:37:32,591 --> 00:37:34,932
Rachel... I told you before --

549
00:37:35,007 --> 00:37:36,633
I get it, Lucas.

550
00:37:36,754 --> 00:37:39,822
You're using me. 
And I'm okay with that...

551
00:37:39,908 --> 00:37:42,981
as long as you let me use you back a little.

552
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,311
Please.

553
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:54,736
"Naked in the backseat" is so last year, it's like two years ago.

554
00:37:57,163 --> 00:37:58,125
Brooke!

555
00:37:58,944 --> 00:38:00,900
This isn't what it looks like.

556
00:38:01,011 --> 00:38:03,486
Anyway, I don't get why you're so upset.

557
00:38:03,563 --> 00:38:04,571
You're kidding, right?

558
00:38:04,648 --> 00:38:07,869
You're the one who wanted to be non-exclusive. I'm just doing what you wanted.

559
00:38:07,935 --> 00:38:09,563
What I wanted?

560
00:38:09,968 --> 00:38:13,204
I wanted you to fight for me.

561
00:38:13,393 --> 00:38:17,331
I wanted you to say there is no one else that you could ever be with

562
00:38:17,377 --> 00:38:20,526
and that you'd rather be alone than without me.

563
00:38:21,057 --> 00:38:25,585
I wanted the Lucas Scott from the beach that night telling the world that he's the one for me.

564
00:38:25,651 --> 00:38:27,554
How was I supposed to know that?

565
00:38:31,047 --> 00:38:32,624
You just are.

566
00:38:35,993 --> 00:38:37,227
One more thing...

567
00:38:43,232 --> 00:38:45,359
don't ever hit me again.

568
00:39:13,457 --> 00:39:15,909
"It's tough to get to know Peyton.

569
00:39:15,991 --> 00:39:19,739
Like me, she tends to keep the world at arm's length.

570
00:39:19,810 --> 00:39:23,043
But in those fleeting moments, 
she's let me in.

571
00:39:23,133 --> 00:39:27,347
I've seen in her such indomitable courage and heart,

572
00:39:27,374 --> 00:39:31,331
a young woman anyone would be proud to call her daughter."

573
00:39:37,393 --> 00:39:39,472
"Dan's the man."

574
00:39:46,599 --> 00:39:48,305
So, you're running against me.

575
00:39:49,231 --> 00:39:53,013
Who'd have thought? 18 years after I picked Deb over you.

576
00:39:54,140 --> 00:39:55,829
What's your point, Dan?

577
00:39:55,933 --> 00:39:58,087
The point is, you came in second place then.

578
00:39:58,150 --> 00:40:00,361
What makes you think it'll be any different now?

579
00:40:48,535 --> 00:40:49,571
Hi, guys.

580
00:40:50,342 --> 00:40:53,217
As you know, I recently met my birth mother,

581
00:40:53,867 --> 00:40:55,643
and I really didn't like her.

582
00:40:55,849 --> 00:40:58,412
As a matter of fact, I drove her away...

583
00:40:59,439 --> 00:41:01,043
and now she's gone.

584
00:41:01,629 --> 00:41:02,564
But...

585
00:41:04,204 --> 00:41:06,579
the part that really sucks is,

586
00:41:07,538 --> 00:41:11,290
you know that thing about judging a book by its cover?

587
00:41:11,347 --> 00:41:12,503
It's true.

588
00:41:12,667 --> 00:41:15,115
Sometimes you got to read the whole thing.

589
00:41:15,380 --> 00:41:18,439
Even then, you still might not know the whole story.

590
00:41:35,297 --> 00:41:36,562
Get your guitar.

591
00:41:36,736 --> 00:41:38,944
And wipe that stupid smile off your face.

592
00:41:57,713 --> 00:42:02,163
