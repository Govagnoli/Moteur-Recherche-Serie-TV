1
00:00:18,745 --> 00:00:21,949
So you want to know what it's like in my high school?

2
00:00:35,694 --> 00:00:41,516
Well, the truth is, there's not a single person in this place worth remembering.

3
00:00:43,343 --> 00:00:45,313
See, people here are fake,

4
00:00:46,011 --> 00:00:48,892
so they stick to their cliques to hide it.

5
00:00:49,178 --> 00:00:51,404
The stoners are medicated,

6
00:00:51,405 --> 00:00:54,355
the honor students are afraid, and the jocks...

7
00:00:54,462 --> 00:00:57,865
well, they're jocks, man.

8
00:00:58,524 --> 00:01:05,089
They'll peak at 17, and their cheerleader girlfriends will be fat and lonely by 21.

9
00:01:06,002 --> 00:01:07,488
Losers!

10
00:01:07,786 --> 00:01:10,324
Everyone here is a loser.

11
00:01:10,972 --> 00:01:15,453
And the truth is, every day I have to come to this school

12
00:01:15,702 --> 00:01:18,638
is one less day I have to come back.

13
00:01:21,604 --> 00:01:22,891
Here we go.

14
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:51,672
Hey!

15
00:01:52,138 --> 00:01:54,157
I heard what you said on the time capsule.

16
00:01:54,158 --> 00:01:55,226
Look, Russ...

17
00:02:00,481 --> 00:02:02,068
Nice locker, boozer.

18
00:02:40,186 --> 00:02:41,592
Call 911.

19
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:46,614
Code red, code red. This is not a drill.

20
00:02:46,615 --> 00:02:50,916
All students to a designated lockdown area. This is a code red.

21
00:02:50,917 --> 00:02:54,263
He puts a shot up and scores! The Ravens are down by one.

22
00:02:54,264 --> 00:02:58,366
Okay, this is a code red. Please, go to a designated lockdown area

23
00:02:58,367 --> 00:03:01,115
or exit the school immediately.

24
00:03:07,784 --> 00:03:08,864
Peyton?

25
00:03:09,293 --> 00:03:10,310
Peyton!

26
00:03:11,444 --> 00:03:12,502
Peyton!

27
00:03:16,907 --> 00:03:18,197
What the hell?

28
00:03:20,216 --> 00:03:21,059
Hey.

29
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:22,990
Somebody has a gun inside, and they're shooting.

30
00:03:22,991 --> 00:03:23,909
Haley!

31
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:26,180
Oh, my god. Everybody back on the bus!

32
00:03:26,181 --> 00:03:27,446
I lost Peyton. I don't know where she is.

33
00:03:27,447 --> 00:03:29,655
She was right there, and a shot went off, and now she's gone.

34
00:03:29,656 --> 00:03:31,256
W-w-wait. Peyton was shot?

35
00:03:31,257 --> 00:03:34,137
No, I don't know. She was right behind me. We were by the library.

36
00:03:34,138 --> 00:03:35,431
Haley's in the tutor center.

37
00:03:35,432 --> 00:03:39,839
All students, on the bus! Code red! Now! Let's move! Come on!

38
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:42,980
Nathan, get your ass on that bus.

39
00:03:44,218 --> 00:03:45,535
- I'll get him, coach.
- Luke!

40
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:47,170
Brooke, I'll be right back.

41
00:03:47,351 --> 00:03:48,541
Nathan!

42
00:03:48,811 --> 00:03:49,962
Boys!

43
00:03:50,279 --> 00:03:51,459
Boys!

44
00:03:52,923 --> 00:03:54,362
Get off me, man.

45
00:03:55,258 --> 00:03:56,667
Haley's inside.

46
00:03:58,426 --> 00:03:59,796
Nathan!

47
00:04:01,635 --> 00:04:02,887
Lucas!

48
00:04:03,166 --> 00:04:04,281
Lucas!

49
00:04:04,834 --> 00:04:06,058
Get on the bus.

50
00:04:06,146 --> 00:04:08,307
Drive, drive! Go, go!

51
00:04:23,667 --> 00:04:26,464
Okay, everybody just stay down and stay calm.

52
00:04:26,465 --> 00:04:27,775
We're safe here.

53
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:51,578
Got a plan?

54
00:04:51,579 --> 00:04:54,899
Yeah. I'm going to the tutor center, and I'm gonna get Haley.

55
00:04:57,843 --> 00:04:58,869
What are you doing?

56
00:04:58,870 --> 00:04:59,835
The plan sucks.

57
00:04:59,836 --> 00:05:00,729
You got a better one?

58
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:02,730
Yeah, we turn around and let the police handle this.

59
00:05:02,731 --> 00:05:05,484
Police are gonna wait and game plan. They always do that.

60
00:05:05,485 --> 00:05:06,774
And what?

61
00:05:06,785 --> 00:05:09,641
You're gonna stop a bullet with a baseball bat?

62
00:05:09,642 --> 00:05:13,092
Nathan -- Nathan, someone has a gun in here.

63
00:05:13,093 --> 00:05:15,983
Lucas, I know that, okay? I know this is stupid.

64
00:05:15,984 --> 00:05:17,743
But what if something happens to Haley, huh?

65
00:05:17,744 --> 00:05:19,874
What if we walk away and something happens to Haley?

66
00:05:19,875 --> 00:05:21,554
Are you gonna live with that?

67
00:05:21,775 --> 00:05:24,461
Most heroes are dead, Nate.

68
00:05:26,047 --> 00:05:28,403
It's Haley, Lucas.

69
00:05:30,717 --> 00:05:32,299
We need to get out of here.

70
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:35,939
No, we need to stay put. It's procedure -- lockdown.

71
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:37,403
We have to wait until it's safe.

72
00:05:37,404 --> 00:05:39,260
And I'm saying lockdown is crap.

73
00:05:39,261 --> 00:05:41,855
If whoever's out there's a student, they know where we're at.

74
00:05:41,856 --> 00:05:43,386
What about the windows?

75
00:05:43,387 --> 00:05:45,433
We could break the windows and get out.

76
00:05:45,434 --> 00:05:48,977
No, it just goes to a courtyard. It's enclosed. It's just for light.

77
00:05:48,978 --> 00:05:51,249
Yeah, besides, we get to breaking all the windows,

78
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:53,200
all we do is draw attention to ourselves.

79
00:05:53,201 --> 00:05:54,752
You don't think a locked door is gonna tell

80
00:05:54,753 --> 00:05:56,911
whatever psycho is out there that we're in here?

81
00:05:56,912 --> 00:05:59,241
Why would you call him psycho?

82
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:05,911
Something to do with them trying to kill us all, fat ass.

83
00:06:09,736 --> 00:06:11,278
Look, there's blood.

84
00:06:15,038 --> 00:06:16,646
Nate, it could be Peyton.

85
00:06:16,755 --> 00:06:18,260
You don't know that.

86
00:06:18,261 --> 00:06:19,822
Well, it's someone.

87
00:06:19,823 --> 00:06:22,117
The  library doors don't lock. It's not safe.

88
00:06:22,118 --> 00:06:25,022
Lucas, I have to find Haley.

89
00:06:25,254 --> 00:06:26,359
I know.

90
00:06:27,697 --> 00:06:28,841
Okay.

91
00:06:31,202 --> 00:06:32,284
Nathan...

92
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:36,523
Yeah.

93
00:06:37,131 --> 00:06:38,417
You too, man.

94
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:44,908
Peyton. Hey, it's okay.

95
00:07:44,909 --> 00:07:46,170
Ow, my leg!

96
00:07:46,234 --> 00:07:48,583
I got cut by some glass.

97
00:07:48,881 --> 00:07:51,534
Lucas, I lost Brooke. I'm sorry.

98
00:07:51,535 --> 00:07:54,469
She's fine. She's fine. But, okay, you're not.

99
00:07:54,470 --> 00:07:56,700
Um, we got to get you somewhere safe. Come on.

100
00:07:56,701 --> 00:07:59,987
No, I can't. I can't walk. I tried.

101
00:08:00,471 --> 00:08:01,697
Okay.

102
00:08:03,939 --> 00:08:04,829
Okay.

103
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:06,877
No, don't leave me, please.

104
00:08:06,878 --> 00:08:09,418
No, look, hey, I'm gonna go block the entrance, all right?

105
00:08:09,419 --> 00:08:14,828
We'll -- we'll just hide, all right, wait this out, okay?

106
00:08:15,063 --> 00:08:17,068
Listen to me, okay?

107
00:08:17,817 --> 00:08:19,803
I'm not leaving you, Peyton.

108
00:08:21,703 --> 00:08:22,848
I won't.

109
00:08:23,412 --> 00:08:25,286
I won't, okay?

110
00:08:39,365 --> 00:08:40,836
Dude, what's happening?

111
00:08:40,837 --> 00:08:43,103
Mouth, what are you doing here?

112
00:08:43,104 --> 00:08:45,284
- I was in the --
- Shh!

113
00:08:46,842 --> 00:08:50,161
I was in the A/V room, and I come out, and it's like "dawn of the dead."

114
00:08:50,162 --> 00:08:51,658
Mouth, don't say  "dead."

115
00:08:51,934 --> 00:08:53,432
Someone's got a gun in the school.

116
00:08:53,433 --> 00:08:54,470
What?

117
00:08:55,241 --> 00:08:56,334
We got to get out of here.

118
00:08:56,335 --> 00:08:58,058
Yeah, you got to get out of here.

119
00:08:58,059 --> 00:08:59,907
I got to go get Haley.

120
00:09:03,843 --> 00:09:05,393
I'll stay with you.

121
00:09:06,268 --> 00:09:07,426
Let's go.

122
00:09:12,696 --> 00:09:14,192
No signal.

123
00:09:14,197 --> 00:09:16,002
All  circuits busy.

124
00:09:26,552 --> 00:09:27,705
It's Nathan.

125
00:09:27,706 --> 00:09:29,516
No way. We don't know it's him.

126
00:09:29,517 --> 00:09:30,766
No, it's his driver's license.

127
00:09:30,767 --> 00:09:33,614
How do you know somebody didn't kill him and take his I.D.?

128
00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:36,454
Okay, you're the one that said this is a lockdown, every man for himself.

129
00:09:36,465 --> 00:09:37,863
She can't leave him out there.

130
00:09:37,864 --> 00:09:39,427
Don't open it.

131
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:42,498
- Do not open that door.
- Shut up! Shut up!

132
00:09:46,301 --> 00:09:47,682
Always...

133
00:09:47,683 --> 00:09:48,882
And forever.

134
00:09:50,243 --> 00:09:51,082
It's him.

135
00:09:51,083 --> 00:09:52,683
No way. Get away from the door.

136
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:56,881
Look, if she say it's him, it's him. Open the door.

137
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:01,118
God, come here. Are you okay?

138
00:10:01,119 --> 00:10:02,624
Yeah. What's going on out there?

139
00:10:02,625 --> 00:10:05,446
I don't know, but we're getting out of here, okay? All of us. Let's go.

140
00:10:05,447 --> 00:10:06,758
Don't.

141
00:10:11,118 --> 00:10:13,048
Nobody's going anywhere.

142
00:10:22,067 --> 00:10:23,765
Get away from the door.

143
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:24,902
Jimmy?

144
00:10:24,902 --> 00:10:25,843
Do it, Mouth!

145
00:10:25,852 --> 00:10:27,138
All right, all right. Just chill out.

146
00:10:27,134 --> 00:10:28,911
Everyone, get away from the door.

147
00:10:29,171 --> 00:10:30,638
Oh, Jimmy, what'd you do?

148
00:10:30,639 --> 00:10:31,840
Move back, Skills.

149
00:10:31,841 --> 00:10:33,388
Or what, you gonna shoot me?

150
00:10:33,389 --> 00:10:34,747
We used to be friends, dog.

151
00:10:34,748 --> 00:10:36,108
Yeah, used to be.

152
00:10:36,109 --> 00:10:38,230
So it's like that? All right.

153
00:10:38,231 --> 00:10:39,838
Jim, you can't do this.

154
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:41,076
It's a little late for that, Mouth.

155
00:10:41,077 --> 00:10:42,267
I can't be here.

156
00:10:42,268 --> 00:10:44,554
Look, man, just let us go. I'm sorry I called you "fat ass."

157
00:10:44,555 --> 00:10:46,456
It's a little late for that, too.

158
00:10:47,922 --> 00:10:49,604
How about you, hero?

159
00:10:50,256 --> 00:10:51,815
Are you scared?

160
00:10:52,574 --> 00:10:54,899
Yeah, I'm scared.

161
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:57,758
Good. Welcome to my world.

162
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,444
All right.

163
00:11:04,713 --> 00:11:06,383
All right, this is what we're gonna do.

164
00:11:06,384 --> 00:11:08,836
You're gonna tape a line down the center of the room.

165
00:11:09,978 --> 00:11:11,343
Go on!

166
00:11:11,645 --> 00:11:13,378
Why are you doing this?

167
00:11:13,651 --> 00:11:15,524
You're Abby Brown, right?

168
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:17,551
What's my name?

169
00:11:18,038 --> 00:11:19,067
Jim?

170
00:11:19,068 --> 00:11:22,880
My full name. Come on! Who am I?!

171
00:11:22,881 --> 00:11:24,021
I don't know.

172
00:11:24,022 --> 00:11:25,412
He's  the guy from the time capsule.

173
00:11:25,413 --> 00:11:26,914
Jimmy Edwards.

174
00:11:27,690 --> 00:11:29,419
You're Jimmy Edwards,

175
00:11:29,576 --> 00:11:32,897
and you're a good guy, and you are better than this.

176
00:11:32,898 --> 00:11:36,293
Just shut up! All of you, just shut up and sit down!

177
00:11:36,294 --> 00:11:40,002
Jimmy, seven hostages in the tutor center? That's not you.

178
00:11:40,003 --> 00:11:41,195
What are you doing? What's in your pocket?

179
00:11:41,196 --> 00:11:42,310
- Nothing.
- What's in your pocket?

180
00:11:42,311 --> 00:11:43,633
Stop pointing the gun at her, all right?

181
00:11:43,634 --> 00:11:44,589
It's just my phone, okay?

182
00:11:44,590 --> 00:11:46,280
Give it to me! Throw it here.

183
00:11:49,566 --> 00:11:54,558
Oh, Haley, I used to like you.

184
00:11:55,035 --> 00:11:58,348
Hi, 911? Here's the thing.

185
00:11:58,349 --> 00:12:01,650
If anyone comes even remotely close to this school,

186
00:12:01,651 --> 00:12:03,651
we start shooting students.

187
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,141
You hear me?

188
00:12:05,143 --> 00:12:08,515
You come in here, your kids die.

189
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:12,775
All right, I want everyone's cellphones! Let's go!

190
00:12:13,156 --> 00:12:16,056
And you, missy pepper spray, roll it over here.

191
00:12:16,059 --> 00:12:18,334
The baseball bat, too. Come on!

192
00:12:20,995 --> 00:12:22,213
Where's your phone, Scott?

193
00:12:22,214 --> 00:12:24,093
I don't have it with me.

194
00:12:25,015 --> 00:12:27,285
You can check me if you want.

195
00:12:27,647 --> 00:12:29,426
Just tape the line.

196
00:12:36,767 --> 00:12:38,119
You're kidding me, right?

197
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:41,052
How the hell can a kid just waltz into a high school with a handgun?

198
00:12:41,053 --> 00:12:43,343
Where the hell is the security, the metal detectors?

199
00:12:43,344 --> 00:12:47,174
Security guards carry nightsticks, Dan. Handguns scare people.

200
00:12:47,175 --> 00:12:49,186
They need probable cause to shake a kid down

201
00:12:49,187 --> 00:12:51,445
because god forbid we violate their rights.

202
00:12:51,446 --> 00:12:53,642
And as far as metal detectors go, the school board --

203
00:12:53,643 --> 00:12:54,925
which I believe you're on --

204
00:12:54,926 --> 00:12:55,941
voted against them.

205
00:12:55,942 --> 00:12:57,528
Voted against them? Why?

206
00:12:57,529 --> 00:12:59,590
Because they make the school look unsafe.

207
00:12:59,591 --> 00:13:03,244
911's got a possible identification on one of the shooters.

208
00:13:03,436 --> 00:13:04,967
Jimmy Edwards?

209
00:13:08,385 --> 00:13:10,242
Look, I just want to go home, okay?

210
00:13:10,243 --> 00:13:11,736
Not without a parent.

211
00:13:11,737 --> 00:13:14,145
But my parents don't live here.

212
00:13:14,146 --> 00:13:16,570
Then I guess you'll be here for a while.

213
00:13:19,093 --> 00:13:20,594
Come on, Lucas.

214
00:13:20,694 --> 00:13:21,677
Jimmy Edwards ?

215
00:13:21,678 --> 00:13:22,936
Mary Edwards?

216
00:13:23,168 --> 00:13:24,152
Yes.

217
00:13:24,153 --> 00:13:25,496
Would you come with me, please?

218
00:13:25,497 --> 00:13:27,031
Is my son okay?

219
00:13:27,415 --> 00:13:29,915
Please just come with me, ma'am.

220
00:13:36,805 --> 00:13:38,256
God!

221
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:44,211
You're bleeding pretty good. We're gonna have to put some pressure on it.

222
00:13:45,301 --> 00:13:48,566
Luke, it was your friend,

223
00:13:49,068 --> 00:13:51,628
the one from the time capsule.

224
00:13:52,509 --> 00:13:54,712
He had the gun.

225
00:13:55,870 --> 00:13:58,987
But he didn't look evil or angry.

226
00:13:59,774 --> 00:14:01,914
He just looked scared.

227
00:14:09,522 --> 00:14:11,969
All right, nobody crosses that line.

228
00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:13,753
If  anybody does...

229
00:14:14,218 --> 00:14:15,442
just don't.

230
00:14:15,443 --> 00:14:18,371
Or what, Jim? Would you really do that?

231
00:14:18,372 --> 00:14:19,644
Would you shoot us?

232
00:14:19,645 --> 00:14:21,240
Don't talk to me, Haley.

233
00:14:21,241 --> 00:14:22,911
'Cause I don't think that you would.

234
00:14:22,912 --> 00:14:25,438
Right. When's the last time we hung out?

235
00:14:25,862 --> 00:14:29,794
You're as bad as my best friend Mouth, who totally blew me off!

236
00:14:29,795 --> 00:14:31,546
You didn't want to do anything.

237
00:14:31,547 --> 00:14:34,863
Tell yourself that, but you changed and you know it.

238
00:14:34,864 --> 00:14:37,196
You became just like the rest of them.

239
00:14:37,197 --> 00:14:38,764
Don't do that.

240
00:14:38,939 --> 00:14:41,707
Don't make him feel guilty for living his life.

241
00:14:41,708 --> 00:14:43,488
This is not his fault.

242
00:14:43,587 --> 00:14:44,804
This is your fault.

243
00:14:44,805 --> 00:14:46,648
No, it's your fault.

244
00:14:46,787 --> 00:14:49,192
You think this is what I wanted?

245
00:14:49,642 --> 00:14:53,406
You think I got up today and wanted this?

246
00:14:53,517 --> 00:14:55,635
I just wanted it to stop.

247
00:14:57,690 --> 00:15:00,156
This is kind of screwed up, huh, Skills?

248
00:15:00,157 --> 00:15:02,160
It's more than "kind of," dog.

249
00:15:02,161 --> 00:15:03,194
For real.

250
00:15:03,195 --> 00:15:05,744
We could charge you, you know?

251
00:15:06,013 --> 00:15:09,711
If we all charged you at once, no way you shoot us all.

252
00:15:09,712 --> 00:15:11,982
Yeah, you're probably right, but...

253
00:15:13,038 --> 00:15:15,087
who's gonna be first?

254
00:15:15,273 --> 00:15:20,135
Besides, even if you get past me, the others will get you.

255
00:15:20,350 --> 00:15:21,701
Are there others, Jim?

256
00:15:21,702 --> 00:15:23,072
No, no, no.

257
00:15:23,073 --> 00:15:24,605
I was out there.

258
00:15:24,606 --> 00:15:25,747
It's just you.

259
00:15:25,748 --> 00:15:27,411
You  think so?

260
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:30,496
Do you really think I'm the only one?

261
00:15:32,162 --> 00:15:34,206
Then ask yourself this --

262
00:15:35,254 --> 00:15:39,318
you ever treat someone like crap in this school or left anyone out?

263
00:15:39,487 --> 00:15:43,962
You ever broken up with someone in the time it takes to pass a note and disappear?

264
00:15:43,963 --> 00:15:46,327
Or talk trash behind their back?

265
00:15:46,328 --> 00:15:48,602
Maybe you just ignored it all,

266
00:15:48,603 --> 00:15:52,641
you know, while you worry about the big game or the prom or

267
00:15:53,033 --> 00:15:55,827
or the bake sale for the pep club.

268
00:15:55,828 --> 00:16:00,656
You ask yourselves that, and then you tell me, is anyone else out there.

269
00:16:02,863 --> 00:16:05,074
Whose phone is that?

270
00:16:05,075 --> 00:16:06,314
It's mine.

271
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,282
It's the ringtone for my mom.

272
00:16:08,283 --> 00:16:10,429
God, I hate that song.

273
00:16:11,448 --> 00:16:13,866
Yeah, open your eyes. Your son's a dick!

274
00:16:15,223 --> 00:16:16,575
Open your eyes!

275
00:16:17,942 --> 00:16:19,447
Open your eyes!

276
00:16:20,339 --> 00:16:21,768
Open your eyes!

277
00:16:23,305 --> 00:16:24,994
Do you think I'm playing around?

278
00:16:24,995 --> 00:16:26,953
Whoa, whoa, just chill out.

279
00:16:26,954 --> 00:16:28,171
Jimmy, please.

280
00:16:28,172 --> 00:16:28,999
You're not gonna do it.

281
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,819
Shut up. Don't push me.

282
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:32,204
Skills, help me out here.

283
00:16:32,205 --> 00:16:33,267
Yo, Marcus, man.

284
00:16:33,268 --> 00:16:34,425
Better back him up!

285
00:16:34,426 --> 00:16:35,804
- Listen to him!
- He's not gonna do it!

286
00:16:35,805 --> 00:16:37,037
- Marcus!
- What?!

287
00:16:39,504 --> 00:16:40,847
That help you out?

288
00:16:41,751 --> 00:16:43,430
Behind the line!

289
00:16:43,665 --> 00:16:45,398
Move, Skills!

290
00:16:45,749 --> 00:16:47,681
Get behind the line!

291
00:16:52,794 --> 00:16:55,403
Look, Reeves, with all due respect,

292
00:16:55,404 --> 00:16:56,623
you know where this Edwards kid is at.

293
00:16:56,624 --> 00:16:59,520
You need to get control of the situation and get somebody into that school.

294
00:16:59,521 --> 00:17:01,473
We know where one kid's at.

295
00:17:01,474 --> 00:17:03,346
Now, can you guarantee me that's the only kid

296
00:17:03,347 --> 00:17:06,144
who walked into that school with a gun this morning?

297
00:17:06,335 --> 00:17:08,717
Look, mayor, this is a static situation.

298
00:17:08,718 --> 00:17:11,325
If and when it becomes active, we will intervene.

299
00:17:11,326 --> 00:17:14,474
But until then, there's a mandated procedure.

300
00:17:14,475 --> 00:17:17,651
We secure the area, we wait for the crisis negotiator,

301
00:17:17,652 --> 00:17:21,274
and we pray to god that Tree Hill High doesn't become just another catchphrase

302
00:17:21,275 --> 00:17:24,594
that people only whisper about for the rest of time.

303
00:17:27,712 --> 00:17:30,211
Is it true? Is it Jimmy Edwards?

304
00:17:30,212 --> 00:17:31,404
One of them.

305
00:17:32,226 --> 00:17:35,006
I know him. He's not a bad kid.

306
00:17:35,641 --> 00:17:37,011
He is now.

307
00:17:43,731 --> 00:17:44,953
Hey.

308
00:17:45,887 --> 00:17:48,474
I don't even know what Lucas is wearing.

309
00:17:48,853 --> 00:17:53,244
The policeman asked, and I couldn't even tell him what Lucas was wearing.

310
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:56,639
I didn't even get a chance to say goodbye.

311
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,033
You're not gonna have to.

312
00:17:59,159 --> 00:18:00,804
You're not gonna have to.

313
00:18:05,296 --> 00:18:09,864
The truth is, every day I have to come to this school

314
00:18:10,081 --> 00:18:12,771
is one less day I have to come back.

315
00:18:12,772 --> 00:18:15,344
That's excellent. I want to air this with a live feed.

316
00:18:15,345 --> 00:18:18,036
I'll get student reactions, their emotions.

317
00:18:18,037 --> 00:18:19,383
There's gold here.

318
00:18:21,186 --> 00:18:23,667
Little insensitive, don't you think?

319
00:18:23,819 --> 00:18:25,626
And you might be?

320
00:18:25,627 --> 00:18:28,391
Brooke Davis, Student Council President.

321
00:18:33,195 --> 00:18:35,468
I'm here with Student Council President Brooke Davis.

322
00:18:35,469 --> 00:18:40,061
Brooke, can you put into words how you might be feeling about this tragedy?

323
00:18:40,984 --> 00:18:43,555
You should be ashamed of yourself.

324
00:18:50,115 --> 00:18:51,818
Might wanna duck.

325
00:18:52,057 --> 00:18:53,993
No, it's just the reporters.

326
00:18:53,994 --> 00:18:56,010
We're all part of the circus now.

327
00:18:56,011 --> 00:18:57,756
Can I ask you a question?

328
00:18:57,952 --> 00:18:59,708
What do you want to happen?

329
00:19:00,041 --> 00:19:01,892
What do I want to happen?

330
00:19:01,924 --> 00:19:07,145
Uh, yeah, I want to crap a million dollars and a plane ticket to Bolivia.

331
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:09,055
Maybe you could just give up.

332
00:19:09,056 --> 00:19:12,005
Oh, yeah, that's it. I'll just call a do-over.

333
00:19:12,006 --> 00:19:16,377
Why not? You didn't hurt anybody... did you?

334
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:19,371
Did you shoot anyone, Jimmy?

335
00:19:21,552 --> 00:19:23,022
I don't know.

336
00:19:23,375 --> 00:19:25,419
You don't have a record, Jim.

337
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:27,739
You're a good student, and you're a minor.

338
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:31,409
Yeah. Maybe this isn't as bad as you think.

339
00:19:34,208 --> 00:19:35,674
You're kidding, right?

340
00:19:35,675 --> 00:19:37,959
The guy shot up a school.

341
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:39,102
Would  you shut up, man?

342
00:19:39,103 --> 00:19:40,495
You shut up.

343
00:19:40,824 --> 00:19:42,518
I'm not lying for him.

344
00:19:42,523 --> 00:19:44,764
He pointed a gun at my head and threatened to kill me.

345
00:19:44,765 --> 00:19:46,581
I hope they fry his ass.

346
00:19:46,882 --> 00:19:48,986
What's wrong with you?

347
00:19:49,452 --> 00:19:51,249
He's just a kid.

348
00:19:52,619 --> 00:19:56,266
We're all just kids, and we just have this life.

349
00:19:56,267 --> 00:19:59,199
And the things you say and do, we feel that.

350
00:19:59,792 --> 00:20:03,101
How can you have so much hate in your heart?

351
00:20:03,687 --> 00:20:08,140
How can you act like it doesn't matter? It does matter.

352
00:20:09,274 --> 00:20:11,319
What happened to us, huh?

353
00:20:11,566 --> 00:20:15,496
We're just kids. We can't be like this.

354
00:20:15,497 --> 00:20:17,740
It's not possible.

355
00:20:19,989 --> 00:20:22,197
It's 700 days --

356
00:20:22,919 --> 00:20:24,389
high school --

357
00:20:25,273 --> 00:20:28,127
out of 20,000 or 30,000.

358
00:20:28,128 --> 00:20:30,443
Can't you see past that?

359
00:20:31,324 --> 00:20:33,874
It's only 700 days.

360
00:20:34,314 --> 00:20:38,920
Yeah, and how many of these days do I get back?

361
00:20:40,306 --> 00:20:43,072
Do I get back the days I got spit on?

362
00:20:43,487 --> 00:20:47,340
Or the day I learned to look at the floor when I walked the halls?

363
00:20:47,341 --> 00:20:49,713
Or how about the day my dad came to pick me up

364
00:20:49,714 --> 00:20:52,230
and saw me getting my ass kicked on the quad

365
00:20:52,231 --> 00:20:54,766
and realized his son was a loser?

366
00:20:56,940 --> 00:21:00,839
You ever see the look in your father's eyes when he realizes that?

367
00:21:02,026 --> 00:21:04,117
Do I get that day back?

368
00:21:04,675 --> 00:21:08,389
'Cause I saw that same look the day he left me and my mom.

369
00:21:11,772 --> 00:21:13,425
That sucks, man.

370
00:21:14,503 --> 00:21:15,631
I'm sorry.

371
00:21:16,027 --> 00:21:18,132
That's great. You're sorry.

372
00:21:18,834 --> 00:21:20,690
You can forget it!

373
00:21:21,767 --> 00:21:23,911
This ain't "breakfast club."

374
00:21:23,912 --> 00:21:28,128
We're not all gonna fire up a joint and be pals. I mean, let's face it.

375
00:21:28,129 --> 00:21:31,893
This is the most any of us have talked in four years.

376
00:21:31,894 --> 00:21:36,097
And we all know if I don't have this gun, it never happens!

377
00:21:36,619 --> 00:21:38,309
People suck, okay?

378
00:21:39,867 --> 00:21:41,616
It's just high school, man.

379
00:21:43,107 --> 00:21:45,797
Yeah, there's always college, right?

380
00:21:46,964 --> 00:21:48,677
M.I.T.

381
00:21:48,951 --> 00:21:50,431
Remember, Jim?

382
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:53,464
They rejected me.

383
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:55,344
And you know why?

384
00:21:55,771 --> 00:21:57,885
Not enough activities.

385
00:21:59,598 --> 00:22:02,946
I guess Tree Hill Fight Club doesn't count.

386
00:22:03,126 --> 00:22:05,838
One school is not the end of the world.

387
00:22:06,017 --> 00:22:07,865
It is for me.

388
00:22:07,866 --> 00:22:09,822
It's the end of my world.

389
00:22:09,991 --> 00:22:11,492
So what?

390
00:22:11,615 --> 00:22:14,790
All this because you didn't into college?

391
00:22:15,203 --> 00:22:16,885
All this because you're not popular?

392
00:22:16,886 --> 00:22:18,203
No.

393
00:22:20,404 --> 00:22:23,229
All this because I'm tired of it.

394
00:22:34,652 --> 00:22:36,852
I'm tired, Luke.

395
00:22:36,938 --> 00:22:38,570
Are you tired?

396
00:22:39,290 --> 00:22:42,740
Yeah, but you got to stay awake, all right?

397
00:22:42,949 --> 00:22:44,523
Talk to me.

398
00:22:45,418 --> 00:22:47,234
Tell me about a good day.

399
00:22:50,461 --> 00:22:55,510
We had a snow day -- sixth grade. Do you remember?

400
00:22:57,018 --> 00:23:04,307
It was like this whole other world just came in overnight and took ours away.

401
00:23:05,545 --> 00:23:09,221
And Brooke -- she came over.

402
00:23:09,454 --> 00:23:13,749
We made a snow fort with a tunnel.

403
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:19,361
And we stayed inside there all day.

404
00:23:20,887 --> 00:23:27,023
And it seemed so safe, like everything was okay.

405
00:23:27,815 --> 00:23:31,801
Like everything our world was about to become,

406
00:23:32,245 --> 00:23:35,271
maybe we could just stop it

407
00:23:36,386 --> 00:23:40,006
and stay little kids for one more day.

408
00:23:42,450 --> 00:23:45,099
But then it got cold...

409
00:23:46,686 --> 00:23:48,826
kind of like now.

410
00:23:51,175 --> 00:23:53,377
They're gonna come now.

411
00:23:54,443 --> 00:23:55,607
Who?

412
00:23:55,608 --> 00:23:57,202
All of them.

413
00:23:58,443 --> 00:24:00,456
The reporters

414
00:24:01,171 --> 00:24:05,181
and the psychologists and the analysts

415
00:24:05,182 --> 00:24:08,661
and the so-called experts.

416
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:12,448
They're gonna try to make sense of this,

417
00:24:12,763 --> 00:24:15,960
but they're not gonna be able to.

418
00:24:17,158 --> 00:24:20,268
And even if we do make it out of here,

419
00:24:20,427 --> 00:24:23,723
we're always gonna carry it with us.

420
00:24:24,658 --> 00:24:27,347
It's never gonna be the same.

421
00:24:33,799 --> 00:24:36,223
It's not glass, is it?

422
00:24:36,856 --> 00:24:38,510
In my leg?

423
00:24:40,895 --> 00:24:42,279
No.

424
00:24:43,601 --> 00:24:45,345
It's a bullet.

425
00:24:46,893 --> 00:24:50,072
Now, I may have to get you out of here, okay?

426
00:24:51,379 --> 00:24:53,893
But nothing will happen to you.

427
00:24:54,191 --> 00:24:55,809
I promise.

428
00:24:57,236 --> 00:25:00,073
You're always saving me.

429
00:25:01,136 --> 00:25:03,334
Somebody's got to.

430
00:25:06,969 --> 00:25:14,842
If I say I love you right now, will you hold it against me?

431
00:25:14,843 --> 00:25:17,627
'Cause I've lost a lot of blood.

432
00:25:20,621 --> 00:25:22,099
Come here.

433
00:25:32,694 --> 00:25:36,040
Just in case you can't keep your promise.

434
00:25:47,423 --> 00:25:49,089
That warm your heart?

435
00:25:51,421 --> 00:25:54,037
Do you think America would tune in for that every night?

436
00:25:54,038 --> 00:25:56,533
Have you seen the ratings for "7th Heaven"?

437
00:25:57,759 --> 00:26:01,119
We're a country obsessed with tragedy, Brooke.

438
00:26:01,708 --> 00:26:06,452
So if examining tragedy makes me part of the problem, then so be it.

439
00:26:06,764 --> 00:26:08,629
But let me ask you something.

440
00:26:08,926 --> 00:26:13,034
How much time have you spent with Jimmy Edwards over the last four years?

441
00:26:16,224 --> 00:26:19,380
So maybe I'm not the only one who should be ashamed.

442
00:26:29,138 --> 00:26:30,454
Brooke?

443
00:26:30,778 --> 00:26:32,651
Hi, I'm Glenda's mom.

444
00:26:32,652 --> 00:26:34,614
I was wondering if you had seen her.

445
00:26:34,615 --> 00:26:38,163
Um... I'm sorry. I don't know anyone n--

446
00:26:38,164 --> 00:26:42,494
Glenda Farrell. She's in your class. She said you were friends.

447
00:26:44,730 --> 00:26:48,770
Glenda. I thought you said Brenda. I'm sorry.

448
00:26:48,771 --> 00:26:51,957
Sure, I'll find her.

449
00:27:21,309 --> 00:27:23,470
I need to get out of here.

450
00:27:23,918 --> 00:27:26,618
Yeah, me too. Can we get a hall pass?

451
00:27:26,882 --> 00:27:30,719
Has it only been an hour? It seems like it's been longer than that.

452
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,972
I have current events this period.

453
00:27:32,973 --> 00:27:34,792
I think this counts.

454
00:27:36,155 --> 00:27:39,815
Edwards, where are you supposed to be right now?

455
00:27:40,452 --> 00:27:43,702
I'm supposed to be in A.P. english, but I stopped going.

456
00:27:43,703 --> 00:27:44,938
Why?

457
00:27:44,944 --> 00:27:48,144
Well, because I missed a couple weeks about three months ago,

458
00:27:48,145 --> 00:27:50,041
and I couldn't catch up.

459
00:27:52,075 --> 00:27:54,183
See, one day I spent a whole day in this school

460
00:27:54,184 --> 00:27:58,442
without a single person looking at me or talking to me,

461
00:27:58,443 --> 00:28:03,341
and I realized that was the best day I'd had in a long time --

462
00:28:03,496 --> 00:28:06,374
the day that nobody noticed me at all.

463
00:28:06,836 --> 00:28:09,299
The day I stopped being there --

464
00:28:09,793 --> 00:28:12,078
that was the best day.

465
00:28:13,632 --> 00:28:19,601
Well, that was kind of depressing, so I went home and took an antidepressant.

466
00:28:19,721 --> 00:28:22,010
And then I took another one,

467
00:28:22,652 --> 00:28:25,381
and then for fun I took 12 more.

468
00:28:27,602 --> 00:28:30,829
My mom and the doctors called it an accident.

469
00:28:31,184 --> 00:28:34,750
And then two weeks later when I got back to school...

470
00:28:36,177 --> 00:28:37,745
nobody noticed.

471
00:28:38,714 --> 00:28:41,722
It was like I never left.

472
00:28:44,422 --> 00:28:48,493
I guess that's the upside of not being there in the first place, right?

473
00:28:48,772 --> 00:28:51,577
Nobody misses you when you're gone.

474
00:28:53,841 --> 00:28:56,356
It's not supposed to be this way.

475
00:28:58,932 --> 00:29:01,586
The artists and the scientists and the poets --

476
00:29:01,587 --> 00:29:03,961
none of them fit in at 17.

477
00:29:06,122 --> 00:29:08,541
You're supposed to get past it.

478
00:29:09,403 --> 00:29:13,973
Adults, they see kids killing kids, and

479
00:29:13,974 --> 00:29:17,568
they know it's a tragedy because they used to be those kids --

480
00:29:17,643 --> 00:29:21,098
the bullies and the beaten and the loners.

481
00:29:25,072 --> 00:29:27,628
You're supposed to get past it.

482
00:29:28,203 --> 00:29:31,611
You're supposed to live long enough to take it back.

483
00:29:33,893 --> 00:29:36,096
Just take it all back.

484
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:43,368
Excuse me.

485
00:29:45,139 --> 00:29:46,706
Are you Glenda?

486
00:29:47,586 --> 00:29:48,632
Yeah.

487
00:29:49,209 --> 00:29:50,422
Okay.

488
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:52,134
Your mom is here.

489
00:29:52,687 --> 00:29:55,627
Oh, I know. I just --

490
00:29:56,209 --> 00:29:58,829
I thought I'd sit here a little while longer.

491
00:30:01,778 --> 00:30:03,140
Why?

492
00:30:04,363 --> 00:30:07,195
Sometimes I think she takes me for granted...

493
00:30:08,917 --> 00:30:11,384
like it wouldn't matter if I wasn't here.

494
00:30:13,001 --> 00:30:15,874
I guess I just wanted her to be afraid of losing me,

495
00:30:15,875 --> 00:30:19,758
you know, feel it a little.

496
00:30:21,787 --> 00:30:24,492
I don't know. That's pretty horrible, isn't it?

497
00:30:26,001 --> 00:30:27,520
Not really.

498
00:30:31,367 --> 00:30:33,537
Well, I guess I better go.

499
00:30:36,281 --> 00:30:37,782
Hey, Glenda?

500
00:30:40,949 --> 00:30:43,325
I'm really sorry I don't know you.

501
00:30:44,291 --> 00:30:45,585
That's okay.

502
00:30:46,424 --> 00:30:47,785
I know you.

503
00:31:00,675 --> 00:31:03,436
Hey, I'm really sorry to call.

504
00:31:07,296 --> 00:31:10,137
That was Brooke. They won't release her without an adult, but I --

505
00:31:10,138 --> 00:31:12,571
It's okay. I'll wait here.

506
00:31:13,597 --> 00:31:17,126
Hey, it's gonna be okay.

507
00:31:17,450 --> 00:31:20,232
I'm not gonna let anything happen to our boy.

508
00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:23,151
Come here.

509
00:31:39,053 --> 00:31:41,224
You shouldn't have come back for me.

510
00:31:41,225 --> 00:31:44,632
I love you for doing it, but I wish you were safe.

511
00:31:44,904 --> 00:31:47,448
I don't want to be safe without you.

512
00:31:47,836 --> 00:31:53,011
I heard what you said, Scott, in the time capsule about Haley.

513
00:31:53,973 --> 00:31:57,044
Guys like you can get away with it.

514
00:31:57,402 --> 00:31:59,409
Guys like me, huh?

515
00:31:59,857 --> 00:32:02,414
You can pass judgment about guys like me all you want,

516
00:32:02,415 --> 00:32:05,025
but somebody stereotypes you, and there's gunplay?

517
00:32:05,026 --> 00:32:06,485
Whatever.

518
00:32:06,549 --> 00:32:09,730
Your worst day in this place would be my best day.

519
00:32:09,731 --> 00:32:13,451
Okay, okay, maybe so, all right? Maybe it is easier for me and my friends.

520
00:32:13,452 --> 00:32:16,302
That doesn't make what you're doing right, does it?

521
00:32:16,303 --> 00:32:18,775
This is wrong, man, all of this.

522
00:32:18,776 --> 00:32:20,534
I think you know that.

523
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:24,294
Abby, are you okay?

524
00:32:24,295 --> 00:32:25,963
I'm fine.

525
00:32:32,331 --> 00:32:34,065
No, you're not.

526
00:32:37,770 --> 00:32:40,164
You're diabetic? Where's you insulin?

527
00:32:40,165 --> 00:32:41,700
- What's wrong with her?
- She's diabetic.

528
00:32:41,701 --> 00:32:42,937
Where is it?

529
00:32:42,938 --> 00:32:45,972
In my locker across the quad. I'm sorry.

530
00:32:45,973 --> 00:32:49,093
No, forget it. It's impossible.

531
00:32:49,094 --> 00:32:50,707
You could let her go.

532
00:32:50,708 --> 00:32:52,427
Yeah, you got us, dog.

533
00:32:52,428 --> 00:32:54,291
Jimmy, she's really sick.

534
00:32:54,292 --> 00:32:55,435
Let her go, Jim.

535
00:32:55,436 --> 00:32:57,085
Yeah, let her go.

536
00:32:57,324 --> 00:32:59,368
Unbelievable!

537
00:33:00,929 --> 00:33:03,433
All right, just you. Come on.

538
00:33:03,434 --> 00:33:04,431
Come on, Abby.

539
00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:08,198
Hey, I'm sick, too.

540
00:33:08,199 --> 00:33:09,882
Seriously. I feel terrible.

541
00:33:09,896 --> 00:33:11,556
Stay behind the line!

542
00:33:11,557 --> 00:33:12,769
Come on.

543
00:33:21,564 --> 00:33:24,267
Go on before I change my mind!

544
00:33:24,898 --> 00:33:26,691
I'm scared.

545
00:33:26,729 --> 00:33:28,162
Of what?

546
00:33:28,692 --> 00:33:30,333
The others.

547
00:33:31,204 --> 00:33:33,276
Are there others, Jim?

548
00:33:35,001 --> 00:33:37,825
Does this feel well-planned to you?

549
00:33:42,525 --> 00:33:44,107
Go.

550
00:34:33,132 --> 00:34:36,151
Hey, what are you doing?! You said you didn't have a phone!

551
00:34:36,152 --> 00:34:37,685
Who'd you call?!

552
00:34:38,417 --> 00:34:40,611
They better not come in here!

553
00:34:41,871 --> 00:34:43,606
I just got a text message from Nathan.

554
00:34:43,607 --> 00:34:45,539
Is he in there? Is Lucas with him?

555
00:34:46,261 --> 00:34:49,557
He says this kid is the only one. They're in the tutor center.

556
00:34:49,902 --> 00:34:51,634
Just Jimmy Edwards, huh?

557
00:34:52,349 --> 00:34:55,279
Look, Danny, I know we've had our difference lately,

558
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:57,982
but you got to let me try to talk to him.

559
00:34:58,006 --> 00:35:00,506
I know this kid. If they go in there,

560
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:03,613
he's gonna get spooked, and this thing is gonna turn out bad.

561
00:35:03,949 --> 00:35:05,249
Please. Just let me try.

562
00:35:05,250 --> 00:35:06,745
No way. It's too dangerous.

563
00:35:06,746 --> 00:35:07,771
Dan?

564
00:35:08,845 --> 00:35:10,048
Please?

565
00:35:10,575 --> 00:35:12,326
You can get me in there.

566
00:35:12,722 --> 00:35:14,443
Nobody has to know.

567
00:35:17,292 --> 00:35:19,496
I should've known it was all about the gun.

568
00:35:19,497 --> 00:35:21,956
So, what -- do I have to pull the trigger again for you to take me seriously?

569
00:35:21,957 --> 00:35:22,832
No!

570
00:35:22,833 --> 00:35:24,097
Edwards, come on, man.

571
00:35:24,098 --> 00:35:28,704
I promise you, whoever steps into that hallway is gonna die.

572
00:35:30,639 --> 00:35:31,902
I got you.

573
00:35:41,292 --> 00:35:43,843
I guess that's my cue.

574
00:35:45,667 --> 00:35:46,966
Don't!

575
00:35:48,177 --> 00:35:49,778
Just stop.

576
00:35:49,805 --> 00:35:51,221
Change it.

577
00:35:52,861 --> 00:35:54,112
Don't do this.

578
00:35:54,113 --> 00:35:58,284
Please, Jim. Just turn yourself in. I can go with you.

579
00:35:58,490 --> 00:36:00,516
This can't be happening.

580
00:36:00,517 --> 00:36:03,880
Yo, Edwards, man, it don't have to be like this, dog.

581
00:36:04,457 --> 00:36:07,173
Yeah, I think it does.

582
00:36:12,069 --> 00:36:13,296
Jimmy.

583
00:36:15,759 --> 00:36:18,783
You know, they're gonna remember me as a monster.

584
00:36:20,807 --> 00:36:23,610
I wonder how they'll remember all of you.

585
00:36:55,828 --> 00:36:57,616
Where do you think you're going?!

586
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:01,375
She's bleeding.

587
00:37:01,376 --> 00:37:04,258
The school's on lockdown!

588
00:37:04,541 --> 00:37:06,142
I know, Jim.

589
00:37:06,825 --> 00:37:09,977
But if I don't get her out of here, she's gonna die.

590
00:37:10,912 --> 00:37:13,167
I didn't mean to hurt her.

591
00:37:14,641 --> 00:37:15,970
We know that, Jimmy.

592
00:37:15,971 --> 00:37:17,977
What the hell is this?!

593
00:37:17,978 --> 00:37:21,106
The school's on lockdown!

594
00:37:21,107 --> 00:37:23,018
Please, Jimmy, just --

595
00:37:23,216 --> 00:37:27,827
please just let them go, and you and I can talk about this.

596
00:37:28,465 --> 00:37:30,492
She's hurt, Jimmy.

597
00:37:30,616 --> 00:37:32,687
I didn't mean it.

598
00:37:34,993 --> 00:37:36,219
I know.

599
00:37:41,987 --> 00:37:43,594
Go on, Luke.

600
00:37:51,038 --> 00:37:52,835
- Keith --
- Luke...

601
00:37:54,361 --> 00:37:56,464
I love you. Now go.

602
00:38:07,154 --> 00:38:09,782
Why don't you just hand me that gun, Jimmy,

603
00:38:09,783 --> 00:38:11,629
and we can just follow them out of here?

604
00:38:11,630 --> 00:38:13,141
I can't.

605
00:38:14,044 --> 00:38:16,742
Well, I'm not gonna leave you here, son.

606
00:38:18,445 --> 00:38:21,142
I'm not gonna do that, and I'll tell you why.

607
00:38:22,164 --> 00:38:24,069
Because I've been there.

608
00:38:24,481 --> 00:38:28,174
I've bought the gun, and I planned on using it, okay?

609
00:38:28,175 --> 00:38:29,941
I've been there,

610
00:38:29,953 --> 00:38:31,944
and I want to tell you something.

611
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:35,194
It gets better.

612
00:38:35,195 --> 00:38:37,839
Not this. It can't.

613
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:39,377
It does, Jimmy.

614
00:38:39,378 --> 00:38:43,467
That pain in your stomach, that pain in your heart, it goes away.

615
00:38:43,468 --> 00:38:48,214
That voice in your head that's saying there's no way out, it's wrong, Jimmy.

616
00:38:48,688 --> 00:38:52,817
Would you please -- please just believe me. It gets better.

617
00:38:52,818 --> 00:38:55,868
It won't! Not after this!

618
00:38:55,869 --> 00:39:00,025
I can't take this back! I can't erase this!

619
00:39:02,170 --> 00:39:03,811
She's gonna die.

620
00:39:04,937 --> 00:39:06,861
You don't know that.

621
00:39:12,624 --> 00:39:14,120
I just --

622
00:39:14,387 --> 00:39:15,822
I wanted --

623
00:39:16,313 --> 00:39:19,065
I wanted them to leave me alone.

624
00:39:19,533 --> 00:39:24,086
I just -- I wanted them to like me.

625
00:39:25,245 --> 00:39:28,488
I understand, son. It's what we all want.

626
00:39:28,808 --> 00:39:30,903
It's all any of us wants.

627
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:35,553
I'm not here.

628
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:40,578
- I'm not here.
- Jimmy, please.

629
00:39:43,601 --> 00:39:47,396
It's gonna be okay, son. It's gonna be okay.

630
00:39:47,397 --> 00:39:49,342
But it hurts!

631
00:39:49,351 --> 00:39:52,735
It hurts. It always hurts!

632
00:39:52,736 --> 00:39:54,112
I know.

633
00:39:57,401 --> 00:39:58,942
Please.

634
00:40:00,365 --> 00:40:01,839
Please.

635
00:40:03,773 --> 00:40:05,946
I'm sorry.

636
00:40:06,028 --> 00:40:07,278
No!

637
00:40:12,129 --> 00:40:14,660
Does this darkness have a name?

638
00:40:16,954 --> 00:40:19,751
This cruelty, this hatred, 

639
00:40:21,488 --> 00:40:23,759
how did it find us?

640
00:40:24,785 --> 00:40:29,469
Did it steal into our lives, or did we seek it out and embrace it?

641
00:40:35,958 --> 00:40:38,027
What happened to us?

642
00:40:39,263 --> 00:40:44,738
That we now send our children into the world like we send young men to war... 

643
00:40:46,914 --> 00:40:49,557
Hoping for their safe return... 

644
00:40:50,306 --> 00:40:53,838
But knowing that some will be lost along the way.

645
00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:06,846
When did we lose our way?

646
00:41:08,678 --> 00:41:13,150
Consumed by the shadows, swallowed whole by the darkness.

647
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:16,819
He's gone, Danny.

648
00:41:17,943 --> 00:41:20,011
He's gone.

649
00:41:32,051 --> 00:41:34,592
Does this darkness have a name?

650
00:41:43,256 --> 00:41:45,325
Is it your name?
