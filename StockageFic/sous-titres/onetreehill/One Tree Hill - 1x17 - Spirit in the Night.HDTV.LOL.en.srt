1
00:01:41,765 --> 00:01:42,620
Ready?

2
00:01:43,373 --> 00:01:49,179
You can’t shoot. You can’t score. You will beat us nevermore. Go Ravens Go…

3
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:51,909
I guess you should feel pretty lucky you get to hang out with me like this.

4
00:01:52,010 --> 00:01:53,818
Do you have any other wishes I can grant?

5
00:01:54,126 --> 00:01:55,272
- Yeah. 
- What?

6
00:01:56,082 --> 00:01:58,057
Why don’t you come to the tournament this weekend.

7
00:01:58,794 --> 00:02:01,160
Ugh. Alright. Yeah. You’re on.

8
00:02:01,232 --> 00:02:01,985
- Alright? 
- Yeah.

9
00:02:02,184 --> 00:02:02,818
Alright.

10
00:02:03,671 --> 00:02:05,307
Thank you, genie. Catch you later.

11
00:02:06,410 --> 00:02:07,180
How’s it going?

12
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:11,240
Well, in a startling new development, it looks like I’m going to be joining you at the classic.

13
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:14,030
You and me in the same hotel? This weekend just got interesting.

14
00:02:14,099 --> 00:02:15,121
Down boy.

15
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:19,239
Plus it’s probably better if I don’t leave you with all those cheerleaders anyway.

16
00:02:19,764 --> 00:02:21,108
So how’d it go?

17
00:02:21,533 --> 00:02:24,156
- I got the apartment.
- Ah, that’s great.

18
00:02:24,396 --> 00:02:27,949
I drained my savings, paid first and last month’s rent. It’s mine on Sunday.

19
00:02:28,072 --> 00:02:28,896
So cool!

20
00:02:31,852 --> 00:02:38,562
Okay. Theresa, terrible posture. Pinch that penny.

21
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:45,254
Bevin, you need… a breath mint.

22
00:02:48,112 --> 00:02:50,675
Peyton. Nice form.

23
00:02:51,116 --> 00:02:53,256
And excellent betrayal of a best friend.

24
00:02:54,455 --> 00:02:58,449
Wrong. Wrong. Wrong. You guys!

25
00:02:58,873 --> 00:03:03,201
This weekend is the Classic. It’s our biggest cheer competition.

26
00:03:03,292 --> 00:03:07,793
Aren’t you sick of Claire Young and Bear Creek Warriors taking home the trophy every year?

27
00:03:07,942 --> 00:03:12,647
Because I am. We need to get it together here and I’m not just talking about our routine.

28
00:03:12,677 --> 00:03:16,425
I’m talking hair, nails… underarms, Theresa.

29
00:03:16,506 --> 00:03:18,731
Brooke, cheerleading is supposed to be fun.

30
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:20,715
Yeah? Well winning’s funner.

31
00:03:21,058 --> 00:03:23,547
And if you don’t like it you can go cheer for the wrestling team.

32
00:03:24,578 --> 00:03:25,569
Take five.

33
00:03:27,438 --> 00:03:32,328
Okay, you know what? You hate me, I get it. Fine. Just don’t take it out on our squad.

34
00:03:32,385 --> 00:03:34,693
Everything is not about you, Peyton.

35
00:03:35,196 --> 00:03:39,194
Did you ever think that maybe I’m being a psycho-hose-beast because I want us to do well this weekend?

36
00:03:39,282 --> 00:03:42,225
Those judges are not going to be as forgiving as I am.

37
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,370
Funny, I didn’t know you were forgiving at all.

38
00:03:48,297 --> 00:03:49,382
Hey, Lips! Come here.

39
00:03:50,786 --> 00:03:51,902
It’s Mouth.

40
00:03:52,025 --> 00:03:54,733
I know. You’re going to be at the Classic this weekend, right?

41
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,919
Ravenshoops.com, never miss a game.

42
00:03:57,410 --> 00:03:59,136
How’d you like to be my scout?

43
00:03:59,326 --> 00:04:02,117
Scope out the competition for me and I’ll pay you 20 bucks.

44
00:04:02,547 --> 00:04:03,857
Spy on cheerleaders?

45
00:04:04,922 --> 00:04:08,409
- I’ll do it for free. 
- Really? Excellent.

46
00:04:08,465 --> 00:04:11,179
- Break’s over, girls.
- You said five minutes.

47
00:04:11,241 --> 00:04:13,088
Yeah well cry me a river. Let’s go.

48
00:04:19,817 --> 00:04:21,568
Lucas! Come in here.

49
00:04:24,051 --> 00:04:24,988
What’s up, Coach?

50
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:26,553
How’s that shoulder?

51
00:04:27,394 --> 00:04:28,880
Therapy’s going kind of slow.

52
00:04:29,032 --> 00:04:32,790
Well, that’s too bad. We could use you this weekend.

53
00:04:32,868 --> 00:04:35,494
Ah come on, man. The Greyhounds suck on D.

54
00:04:35,854 --> 00:04:37,578
We’ll get your 500th win easy, Coach.

55
00:04:38,485 --> 00:04:39,841
Just wish I could do my part.

56
00:04:40,266 --> 00:04:43,004
Well, maybe you can.

57
00:04:44,132 --> 00:04:47,271
One of your teammates needs a little extra coaching.

58
00:04:48,075 --> 00:04:50,046
Okay. Sure, I’ll help whoever.

59
00:04:53,092 --> 00:04:55,292
- You wanted to see me? 
- I did.

60
00:04:56,441 --> 00:05:00,793
With Lucas on the injured list, you’re going to see a lot more double teams.

61
00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:05,200
Now Lucas is damn good at creating space for open shots.

62
00:05:05,617 --> 00:05:07,397
I want you two to work together.

63
00:05:07,526 --> 00:05:10,054
There’s nothing he can teach me about my game or anything else.

64
00:05:10,142 --> 00:05:13,244
He can teach you to listen when I tell you to do something.

65
00:05:15,944 --> 00:05:18,135
I’d start now if I were you.

66
00:05:26,787 --> 00:05:29,997
You know, if those countertops get any cleaner we’re not going to need plates.

67
00:05:30,904 --> 00:05:31,846
Sorry.

68
00:05:32,746 --> 00:05:37,314
But how terrible of a mother am I that my own son wants to divorce me.

69
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:39,398
Deb, you’re not mommy dearest.

70
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:42,935
Nathan’s hurt but he’ll forgive you. It’s just going to take some time.

71
00:05:45,007 --> 00:05:45,808
Keith.

72
00:05:45,906 --> 00:05:47,784
Hey. Karen.

73
00:05:48,675 --> 00:05:51,323
I just wanted to get a cup of coffee to go.

74
00:05:51,978 --> 00:05:54,682
Oh sure. We haven’t seen you in a while.

75
00:05:55,003 --> 00:05:57,017
Yeah, I’ve been pretty busy at work.

76
00:05:57,927 --> 00:05:59,714
- Well that’s good.
- Yep.

77
00:06:02,197 --> 00:06:05,013
Okay, thanks. See you, Deb.

78
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,137
Karen.

79
00:06:07,512 --> 00:06:08,736
Keith.

80
00:06:10,415 --> 00:06:12,622
Why don’t you come by some night for dinner.

81
00:06:13,538 --> 00:06:14,598
Like we used to.

82
00:06:16,467 --> 00:06:18,744
How about tomorrow night?

83
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:19,805
Okay.

84
00:06:20,226 --> 00:06:20,768
Okay.

85
00:06:24,388 --> 00:06:25,407
Baby steps.

86
00:06:26,385 --> 00:06:30,751
Karen. Deb. So glad I found two booster moms in one place.

87
00:06:30,926 --> 00:06:34,064
Look, Judy Johnson backed out of the classic at the last minute

88
00:06:34,213 --> 00:06:36,277
and I need a fill in chaperone.

89
00:06:38,334 --> 00:06:41,129
Oh, I have a meeting with my attorney. I can’t cancel.

90
00:06:41,186 --> 00:06:43,808
I heard about you and Dan. How awful.

91
00:06:44,449 --> 00:06:47,843
So… Karen? How was Italy?

92
00:06:47,965 --> 00:06:50,095
You know we really missed you at the silent auction.

93
00:06:50,299 --> 00:06:52,973
And the pancake breakfast, and the bake sale, and...

94
00:06:53,019 --> 00:06:54,474
Okay, when does the bus leave?

95
00:06:56,956 --> 00:06:59,650
Hey, Matt. What are you doing?

96
00:06:59,896 --> 00:07:01,197
Making room for the new equipment.

97
00:07:01,325 --> 00:07:04,129
Hey, don’t let this guy get away with half days cause he’s related to the boss.

98
00:07:04,821 --> 00:07:06,834
Oh my God, I thought one of you was bad enough.

99
00:07:07,131 --> 00:07:09,397
That jumpsuit looks good on you, Keith. How’s your day going?

100
00:07:09,492 --> 00:07:14,571
Well  let’s see. You changed my sign, you make me wear this monkey suit,

101
00:07:14,748 --> 00:07:16,458
and you’re replacing all my equipment.

102
00:07:16,797 --> 00:07:18,824
What’s next? You going to start fixing bicycles too?

103
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:22,158
If it would turn a profit. Remember, Dan Scott is a name people trust.

104
00:07:22,204 --> 00:07:24,128
Yeah, maybe people don’t know him.

105
00:07:24,349 --> 00:07:28,318
Listen, this equipment in this place is obsolete anyway, I feel like I’m stuck in 1982 in here.

106
00:07:28,358 --> 00:07:31,241
- The machines work fine.
- Not as good as the new ones.

107
00:07:31,409 --> 00:07:34,916
Now I told you I was going to help you with your shop. This is part of the agreement.

108
00:07:35,085 --> 00:07:37,145
You got to start thinking like a business man, bro.

109
00:07:37,205 --> 00:07:40,036
I think you do enough of that for the both of us. Bro.

110
00:07:47,728 --> 00:07:50,333
If  Whitey wants you to feel like you’re part of the team, fine, I just...

111
00:07:51,344 --> 00:07:53,759
I don’t understand why I have to baby-sit you.

112
00:07:53,994 --> 00:07:55,586
He just wants to make sure you’re going to be able to get open.

113
00:07:55,639 --> 00:07:59,816
- I don’t have a problem with getting open. 
- Well you will with me out of the line up. Okay?

114
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,950
The Fade-away is a great shot for creating space.

115
00:08:03,984 --> 00:08:06,692
- You want to work on it or what? 
- I don’t need to work on it.

116
00:08:07,655 --> 00:08:09,611
Okay, show me. Come on.

117
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:17,347
Try it again.

118
00:08:18,821 --> 00:08:21,805
I’ll tell you what. I’ll hit your fade-away, when you can do this.

119
00:08:27,133 --> 00:08:27,941
Thought so.

120
00:08:29,312 --> 00:08:31,443
Nathan, the point is you’re not going to be able to do that.

121
00:08:32,098 --> 00:08:32,799
Excuse me?

122
00:08:32,866 --> 00:08:35,113
You’re not going to be able to get to the rack like that. You’ll be double teamed.

123
00:08:36,281 --> 00:08:38,688
You know what? I don’t need your coaching.

124
00:08:41,168 --> 00:08:43,648
Just watch me get to the rack this weekend.

125
00:08:49,664 --> 00:08:52,931
Well, I just don’t want you to think I’m trailing you like some paranoid mother.

126
00:08:53,039 --> 00:08:54,087
- But you are. 
- Ohh.

127
00:08:54,574 --> 00:08:55,244
It’s cool.

128
00:08:58,148 --> 00:08:59,322
Silent treatment.

129
00:09:00,007 --> 00:09:01,020
Like a mime.

130
00:09:03,063 --> 00:09:06,811
Okay, with the way you drive this thing we could have gotten there in 45 minutes

131
00:09:06,857 --> 00:09:08,640
and not had to deal with this whole bus mess.

132
00:09:08,681 --> 00:09:12,152
Yeah but I’ve got to embarrass you as much as possible in front of your friends.

133
00:09:12,453 --> 00:09:13,652
Make up for lost time.

134
00:09:14,533 --> 00:09:17,129
- Which one are you dating again? 
- Try no one.

135
00:09:17,573 --> 00:09:19,641
- Larry Sawyer meet Karen Roe. 
- Hi.

136
00:09:19,733 --> 00:09:21,941
You two are my chaperones.

137
00:09:22,059 --> 00:09:26,410
A lot of these kids think that the Classics is an excuse to party all weekend.

138
00:09:26,483 --> 00:09:28,699
It’s your job to see that that doesn’t happen.

139
00:09:28,966 --> 00:09:31,618
Oh we don’t have a prayer. I used to be one of these kids.

140
00:09:31,659 --> 00:09:33,692
You? I’ve got a beer bong in my over night bag.

141
00:09:33,938 --> 00:09:36,645
I don’t care how important this tournament is,

142
00:09:36,806 --> 00:09:41,633
people trump pom-poms. We can’t fit all that crap on the bus.

143
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:45,242
Fine! You be responsible for ten very pissed off cheerleaders.

144
00:09:45,290 --> 00:09:47,250
Coach, if we’re short on room I can drive.

145
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:50,780
- No, no, no, forget it. 
- Why not? I can fit all that crap in my trunk.

146
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:58,340
Alright. But you stay right behind the bus.

147
00:09:59,723 --> 00:10:00,399
Thanks.

148
00:10:00,823 --> 00:10:02,344
Sweet. Come on, Hales.

149
00:10:03,086 --> 00:10:04,969
Oh, uh, Lucas is saving me a seat.

150
00:10:06,035 --> 00:10:08,647
What are you in third grade? Come on, we’ll ride in style.

151
00:10:14,028 --> 00:10:16,429
Hey, um, I’m going to ride with Nathan. Is that cool?

152
00:10:16,823 --> 00:10:18,446
Yeah, no problem.

153
00:10:26,072 --> 00:10:30,904
Listen up. We’ve got a team meeting in the conference room right after dinner.

154
00:10:30,965 --> 00:10:32,860
Lights out at nine o’clock.

155
00:10:33,316 --> 00:10:35,697
Consider your room assignments final.

156
00:10:39,737 --> 00:10:40,780
You’ve got to be kidding me.

157
00:10:41,983 --> 00:10:47,124
Alphabetical order. Scott. Scott. Unalterable.

158
00:10:49,852 --> 00:10:51,467
You should have changed your name.

159
00:11:16,593 --> 00:11:17,865
I was listening to that.

160
00:11:18,277 --> 00:11:19,129
Not anymore.

161
00:11:19,686 --> 00:11:20,646
Watching TV.

162
00:11:26,474 --> 00:11:27,430
Not anymore.

163
00:11:33,410 --> 00:11:35,907
So which bed do you want? The window or the door?

164
00:11:36,308 --> 00:11:37,085
Whatever.

165
00:11:37,365 --> 00:11:39,048
Brooke, can we just make the best of this?

166
00:11:39,199 --> 00:11:42,815
Fine. But I’m not doing it for you, I’m doing it for the squad.

167
00:11:43,311 --> 00:11:44,638
Call it a cheer truce.

168
00:11:57,347 --> 00:11:59,343
Bam Chica Da Na.

169
00:11:59,634 --> 00:12:02,231
So you ladies order room service?

170
00:12:07,996 --> 00:12:11,666
God. Good to have an escape route incase she tries to smoother me with her pillow.

171
00:12:12,407 --> 00:12:13,193
How you doing?

172
00:12:14,474 --> 00:12:15,589
Jenny withdrawal.

173
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:19,798
Yeah. No but you need a weekend away, just to relax and have a good time.

174
00:12:20,263 --> 00:12:21,671
Doesn’t happen too often.

175
00:12:21,958 --> 00:12:25,854
That’s true, but, there’s been some new developments.

176
00:12:25,921 --> 00:12:27,524
Oh really? What are they?

177
00:12:28,773 --> 00:12:30,811
Peyton, it’s an emergency, get in here.

178
00:12:30,919 --> 00:12:32,608
Ugh. Sorry.

179
00:12:33,073 --> 00:12:35,419
Cheer Nazi calls. See ya.

180
00:12:38,291 --> 00:12:40,037
Guess who’s in the lobby, I’ll tell you.

181
00:12:40,093 --> 00:12:43,054
Claire Young and her little hoe posy. We are going down there.

182
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:46,555
Okay. And if an angry dance-off breaks out I got your back.

183
00:12:46,638 --> 00:12:48,962
Great. Just don’t stick another knife in it.

184
00:12:49,059 --> 00:12:52,902
Theresa, I want you to hit those pits and cover that zit. Points off for complexion.

185
00:12:53,004 --> 00:12:54,189
Let’s go.

186
00:13:04,395 --> 00:13:05,362
Hi, Claire.

187
00:13:07,001 --> 00:13:09,514
We just wanted to wish you good luck this weekend.

188
00:13:09,863 --> 00:13:12,734
Um, we’ve won four years in a row.

189
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:15,072
Including Claire for best choreography.

190
00:13:15,292 --> 00:13:18,315
Yeah so maybe you should keep your luck for yourself.

191
00:13:18,597 --> 00:13:21,613
By the way. Who are you again?

192
00:13:22,765 --> 00:13:26,999
You know who I am. Brooke Davis. Captain of the Tree Hill Ravens.

193
00:13:27,261 --> 00:13:29,359
We roomed together last summer at spirit camp.

194
00:13:29,896 --> 00:13:31,289
Right, right.

195
00:13:31,995 --> 00:13:34,111
Don’t the Ravens lose every year?

196
00:13:35,883 --> 00:13:36,624
See ya.

197
00:13:42,146 --> 00:13:44,109
Oh it is so on.

198
00:13:51,109 --> 00:13:52,436
You scared me.

199
00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:55,610
Well, we’re not allowed to have girls in the room so I had to keep it covert.

200
00:13:55,905 --> 00:13:57,575
-  Hang out for a little bit.
- Oh I can’t.

201
00:13:57,622 --> 00:14:00,566
I’ve got to meet Lucas for pizza in the lobby. I think I’m already late.

202
00:14:00,628 --> 00:14:03,862
So be later. We’ve got a whole hotel room to ourselves.

203
00:14:10,201 --> 00:14:12,429
Sorry, I thought we had plans.

204
00:14:12,623 --> 00:14:14,564
- We do. 
- Naw, just do your thing.

205
00:14:15,184 --> 00:14:16,602
I’m sorry. Lucas.

206
00:14:18,117 --> 00:14:20,759
Luke. Will you just wait...

207
00:14:20,876 --> 00:14:23,410
Haley. It’s cool. Okay?

208
00:14:24,976 --> 00:14:26,974
Go be with your boyfriend.

209
00:14:32,964 --> 00:14:35,335
- Hello? 
- Hey, Keith, it’s me.

210
00:14:35,667 --> 00:14:36,631
Oh hey, Karen.

211
00:14:36,969 --> 00:14:41,183
Look one of the booster moms trapped me into chaperoning the Classics,

212
00:14:41,219 --> 00:14:45,529
so now I’m in Charlotte. Um, can I get a rain check on dinner?

213
00:14:45,576 --> 00:14:50,834
Oh, sure. We’re pretty backed up at the shop so I was going to have to cancel anyway.

214
00:14:50,875 --> 00:14:53,696
Okay, well, I’ll see you when I get back.

215
00:14:54,296 --> 00:14:55,400
Hope so.

216
00:14:56,646 --> 00:14:58,188
- Bye. 
- Bye-bye.

217
00:15:05,054 --> 00:15:09,528
I cannot believe the nerve of that little third rate Britney trying to pretend like she doesn’t recognize me.

218
00:15:09,569 --> 00:15:12,779
Are you still obsessing over this? You made out with her boyfriend at camp.

219
00:15:12,829 --> 00:15:15,334
I didn’t know they were dating, unlike some people.

220
00:15:15,396 --> 00:15:18,012
And besides he was a yell leader, he was gay anyway.

221
00:15:18,119 --> 00:15:21,191
Hey, ladies. We’re sneaking out after curfew, spread the word okay?

222
00:15:21,252 --> 00:15:25,456
Tim, stay away from my squad we need to be fresh for tomorrow.

223
00:15:25,497 --> 00:15:26,286
Okay.

224
00:15:27,837 --> 00:15:30,320
Theresa I thought I told you to lay off the chocolate.

225
00:15:30,597 --> 00:15:33,055
- It’s a really good thing I have an acne medicine.
- Brooke this isn’t acne.

226
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:39,915
It’s chicken pox. Karen called my parents. I’m out. Thank God.

227
00:15:43,315 --> 00:15:44,830
Okay, could this get any worse?

228
00:15:44,902 --> 00:15:48,047
Brooke, it’s okay. We’ll rework the routine.

229
00:15:48,112 --> 00:15:50,340
It’s perfectly crafted for ten girls.

230
00:15:50,401 --> 00:15:52,152
Okay, so we’ll find a replacement.

231
00:15:52,208 --> 00:15:54,227
Great idea, genius. Who are we going to ask?

232
00:15:55,744 --> 00:15:56,817
No way!

233
00:15:56,970 --> 00:16:00,345
Haley, come on. Do you remember when I made you those flyers for open mic night?

234
00:16:00,405 --> 00:16:02,434
That is weak, you’re a born artist.

235
00:16:02,535 --> 00:16:07,054
I’m a born klutz, okay? I almost drowned in the balls at chucky cheese.

236
00:16:07,108 --> 00:16:09,643
Okay but if we don’t find a replacement we’re going to have to forfeit.

237
00:16:09,694 --> 00:16:13,160
Don’t you guys, like, lose every year since grade school anyway? What’s the big deal?

238
00:16:13,355 --> 00:16:14,926
It’s important to Brooke.

239
00:16:16,446 --> 00:16:18,946
Do you know how terrible it is to be disconnected from your best friend?

240
00:16:20,146 --> 00:16:21,777
Look I really hurt Brooke.

241
00:16:21,996 --> 00:16:24,436
And I just don’t want her to be disappointed again.

242
00:16:26,754 --> 00:16:28,004
Hey, Matt, how’s it going?

243
00:16:28,067 --> 00:16:30,922
Good, we’re just about to close up. We’ll finish the rest tomorrow.

244
00:16:30,985 --> 00:16:34,431
Not tomorrow. Tonight. We’ve got a whole new slate tomorrow. What’s taking so long?

245
00:16:34,942 --> 00:16:37,650
We’re just getting up to speed on the new equipment.

246
00:16:39,447 --> 00:16:42,411
Uh huh. I’m sure you are. Thanks.

247
00:16:44,889 --> 00:16:46,205
Hey, Keith, how’s it going?

248
00:16:46,829 --> 00:16:50,522
Great. Just finished my taxes and I’m about to download some tunes.

249
00:16:51,011 --> 00:16:54,147
You know, the junior college offers manufacturers training.

250
00:16:54,479 --> 00:16:55,709
Might help you learn the system.

251
00:16:55,877 --> 00:16:58,632
It’s not about the system, Dan, it’s about the mechanic.

252
00:16:59,304 --> 00:17:00,577
A car is still a car.

253
00:17:00,942 --> 00:17:04,382
Anyone who drop out who takes high school shop knows more about these machines than you do.

254
00:17:04,873 --> 00:17:06,236
You should really think about enrolling.

255
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:08,923
You should really think about stepping three feet back.

256
00:17:10,762 --> 00:17:12,779
If you had gone to college in the first place,

257
00:17:12,988 --> 00:17:15,518
you might not have to get your hands dirty at all.

258
00:17:19,855 --> 00:17:21,835
- Well, I think that’s everybody. 
- Yeah.

259
00:17:21,871 --> 00:17:23,065
8:59, that’s not bad.

260
00:17:23,182 --> 00:17:27,018
Yeah, except for that Tim kid peeing in the ice machine, this was easy.

261
00:17:27,237 --> 00:17:30,013
Too easy. Think we should check again at ten?

262
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:32,318
You want to grab a cup of coffee in about a half hour?

263
00:17:32,459 --> 00:17:34,159
Sounds like it’s going to be a late night.

264
00:17:34,509 --> 00:17:36,796
- Yeah. I’ll meet you downstairs.
- Alright.

265
00:17:52,748 --> 00:17:54,501
Just leave the cake and go.

266
00:17:54,939 --> 00:17:57,937
Well we’re safe. All the other girls have had chicken pox.

267
00:17:58,051 --> 00:17:59,913
Theresa always was a beat behind.

268
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:05,003
How you doing?

269
00:18:08,253 --> 00:18:09,278
Pretty crappy.

270
00:18:10,573 --> 00:18:15,074
I put all my energy into this competition and it made me feel really good for a few days.

271
00:18:15,806 --> 00:18:19,221
Took my mind off everything, but now I’m just back to square one.

272
00:18:19,444 --> 00:18:23,507
You know, we haven’t had a chance to talk since you and Lucas broke up.

273
00:18:24,786 --> 00:18:25,995
I’m really sorry.

274
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:27,861
His loss, right?

275
00:18:28,165 --> 00:18:29,303
He probably knows that.

276
00:18:30,883 --> 00:18:36,552
And I know it doesn’t seem like it, but I bet you and Peyton will get through this too.

277
00:18:39,431 --> 00:18:44,033
And now, from a former Ravens cheer captain to another,

278
00:18:44,084 --> 00:18:46,572
I think you have taken these girls too far to give up.

279
00:18:46,916 --> 00:18:50,941
Our routine is for ten girls, Karen. Without Theresa we’re only nine,

280
00:18:51,022 --> 00:18:53,045
so unless I can pull a cheerleader out of my ass...

281
00:18:53,116 --> 00:18:56,275
Hey. Haley said she’d fill in for Theresa.

282
00:18:57,315 --> 00:19:00,550
I make no apologies for my lack of coordination, it’s genetic.

283
00:19:01,262 --> 00:19:02,219
It’s impossible.

284
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:04,780
Brooke, you’re a captain.

285
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:09,977
We can still do it. You just need to get off your ass and stop pouting.

286
00:19:10,555 --> 00:19:12,004
We’d have to practice all night.

287
00:19:13,894 --> 00:19:16,325
And it’s past curfew.

288
00:19:17,566 --> 00:19:20,222
If anyone asks, I was never here.

289
00:19:23,464 --> 00:19:25,608
Okay. Okay.

290
00:19:25,818 --> 00:19:29,637
I’m going to get the rest of the girls. We’re going to need coffee, black, sleep is our enemy.

291
00:19:29,755 --> 00:19:32,485
And we’re going to need to do something about that hair.

292
00:19:34,285 --> 00:19:35,284
Let’s go.

293
00:19:40,298 --> 00:19:41,516
So I thought you were hanging out with Haley.

294
00:19:41,578 --> 00:19:44,199
Yeah, me too. She’s probably hanging with Nathan.

295
00:19:44,431 --> 00:19:45,084
Tim.

296
00:19:46,570 --> 00:19:47,245
Or not.

297
00:19:48,074 --> 00:19:50,112
We’re good. Whitey’s in for the night.

298
00:19:51,287 --> 00:19:54,034
So you ladies finally escaped psycho Brooke, huh?

299
00:19:55,124 --> 00:19:57,326
Psycho Brooke told you to leave her squad alone.

300
00:19:59,268 --> 00:20:00,342
Raven’s  we’re back on.

301
00:20:00,523 --> 00:20:01,494
Come on, Brooke.

302
00:20:03,388 --> 00:20:06,281
Sad state of affairs when our own cheerleaders ditch us.

303
00:20:06,333 --> 00:20:08,179
Not really. I know this club.

304
00:20:08,611 --> 00:20:12,924
They’re a little loose on checking ID’s. That’s not the only thing that’s loose.

305
00:20:12,979 --> 00:20:14,878
Tim, just say it’s a strip club.

306
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:16,946
How are we going to get in?

307
00:20:17,003 --> 00:20:19,240
Everybody chips in ten bucks and I grease the bouncer.

308
00:20:19,286 --> 00:20:20,996
And after that you can bribe him.

309
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:23,695
5...6...7...8.

310
00:20:30,148 --> 00:20:33,950
No, no, no. Tutor girl. It’s feet together, apart, then clap.

311
00:20:34,098 --> 00:20:36,127
Okay, I’m really trying.

312
00:20:36,177 --> 00:20:37,826
Try harder cause we’re on in 12 hours.

313
00:20:38,543 --> 00:20:43,970
Aw, cute routine, girls. Too bad those moves are so ‘03.

314
00:20:44,457 --> 00:20:46,739
Where’d you find your choreographer anyway?

315
00:20:47,130 --> 00:20:49,899
In the yellow pages? Under ‘S’ for Sucks?

316
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:53,029
No, actually that’s where I found your boyfriend.

317
00:20:53,104 --> 00:20:56,602
Oh, you know if I were you, I’d get some beauty sleep.

318
00:20:56,975 --> 00:20:59,065
I think it’s the only thing that’s going to help.

319
00:20:59,204 --> 00:21:02,300
If I were you, I’d step back from my friend.

320
00:21:04,328 --> 00:21:10,451
Whatever. Oh and remember, ladies. Jazz fingers!

321
00:21:15,497 --> 00:21:17,383
I’ll give her a jazz finger.

322
00:21:18,551 --> 00:21:22,057
Well, she’s obviously scared cause their routine probably sucks.

323
00:21:22,179 --> 00:21:24,174
Actually it’s good. I’ve seen it.

324
00:21:25,319 --> 00:21:26,094
How good?

325
00:21:26,251 --> 00:21:27,865
Lots of spins. Some tumbles.

326
00:21:27,931 --> 00:21:32,309
Okay, no, give me information I can use, Mouth. What are the moves exactly?

327
00:21:32,452 --> 00:21:33,549
First they do this.

328
00:22:07,324 --> 00:22:10,141
That is good. Do you want to replace tutor girl?

329
00:22:10,797 --> 00:22:12,152
No, thanks.

330
00:22:12,517 --> 00:22:15,773
Oh and by the way, three other team are using Junior-Senior.

331
00:22:17,867 --> 00:22:18,584
Okay.

332
00:22:19,453 --> 00:22:22,844
Okay, it’s time for plan B, we’re going to find Claire Young’s room and pull a Tonya Harding.

333
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,478
We’re just going to hit her in the knee with a big stick.

334
00:22:24,517 --> 00:22:28,030
Okay Brooke. You’re a better choreographer than Claire has ever been. Okay?

335
00:22:28,071 --> 00:22:32,003
We still have time to win it, just teach us some new moves.

336
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:35,520
Well what about our song?

337
00:22:35,572 --> 00:22:38,900
You handle the moves. Let me take care of the song.

338
00:22:45,625 --> 00:22:47,982
I got to hand it to you Tim, for once.

339
00:22:51,533 --> 00:22:52,387
Vodka?

340
00:22:52,857 --> 00:22:53,626
Water.

341
00:22:54,322 --> 00:22:56,354
Although the last couple of days I’ve been tempted.

342
00:22:57,634 --> 00:22:58,351
Tough week?

343
00:22:59,190 --> 00:22:59,995
Yeah.

344
00:23:01,558 --> 00:23:03,706
Jenny’s mom popped up unannounced.

345
00:23:03,859 --> 00:23:05,883
Wow. How’d that go?

346
00:23:05,943 --> 00:23:11,448
Oh, not good. But you now what, I don’t really want to talk about her.

347
00:23:11,494 --> 00:23:16,578
I don’t really get nights like this too often, so she’s not going to ruin it.

348
00:23:17,791 --> 00:23:19,896
What’s going on with you? Brooke? Peyton?

349
00:23:19,968 --> 00:23:21,504
Nothing anymore.

350
00:23:22,379 --> 00:23:23,838
And then there’s Nathan and Haley.

351
00:23:25,398 --> 00:23:28,380
Haley could be with anybody and I’d be happy for her. I mean even…

352
00:23:30,041 --> 00:23:32,650
Tim. But Nathan...

353
00:23:33,008 --> 00:23:36,457
Luke, I mean Nathan is not my favorite guy but I don’t know,

354
00:23:37,591 --> 00:23:40,166
if Haley sees something in him, there’s probably something there.

355
00:23:40,581 --> 00:23:42,261
She’s got pretty good taste in people, right?

356
00:23:42,384 --> 00:23:44,386
Welcome to the Peppermint Zebra.

357
00:23:46,618 --> 00:23:48,288
Is something a little off about this crowd?

358
00:23:48,508 --> 00:23:50,493
It’s ladies night!

359
00:24:00,422 --> 00:24:02,076
5...6...7...8...

360
00:24:02,156 --> 00:24:06,724
1...2...3...4...5...6...7...8...

361
00:24:06,811 --> 00:24:11,193
1 and 2...3...4...5...6...7...8.

362
00:24:11,343 --> 00:24:13,805
Okay. Bevin, I want you to go into a high kick.

363
00:24:14,316 --> 00:24:16,892
- Tutor girl, I want you to do a diagonal. 
- What’s a diagonal?

364
00:24:18,752 --> 00:24:19,334
Thank you.

365
00:24:20,008 --> 00:24:22,785
Alright, alright. Ripped and burned. It’s a remix.

366
00:24:23,017 --> 00:24:25,033
Trust me, nobody else is going to have this.

367
00:24:25,705 --> 00:24:26,697
This better be good.

368
00:24:27,455 --> 00:24:28,284
You’re welcome.

369
00:24:29,511 --> 00:24:32,411
We get this right to the music, I’ll spring for escorts, guys.

370
00:24:40,978 --> 00:24:42,318
Hey. Hotel’s this way.

371
00:24:43,016 --> 00:24:44,462
Yeah I’m just gonna go check out the gym.

372
00:24:45,939 --> 00:24:47,015
Hey you mind if I come?

373
00:24:47,936 --> 00:24:49,088
Uh yeah. Whatever.

374
00:24:54,175 --> 00:24:55,866
I’m gonna wipe this place up tomorrow.

375
00:24:56,422 --> 00:24:59,814
My dad’s not going to be here so I figured I’d go for season high just to piss him off.

376
00:25:00,091 --> 00:25:01,441
Where is he this weekend, anyway?

377
00:25:01,493 --> 00:25:04,689
The lawyers told him to skip a game. Show he’s not controlled by basketball.

378
00:25:05,033 --> 00:25:07,423
So he bought a satellite dish to bring in the live feed.

379
00:25:08,155 --> 00:25:09,629
Man, I wish I was out there.

380
00:25:11,181 --> 00:25:12,928
The way I feel like I'll be back.

381
00:25:12,973 --> 00:25:16,419
There’s always other sports. You don’t need arms to suck at soccer.

382
00:25:17,427 --> 00:25:20,049
I busted my elbows once a couple of summers ago.

383
00:25:20,939 --> 00:25:22,594
I was playing again in like six weeks.

384
00:25:23,156 --> 00:25:24,123
What’s the secret?

385
00:25:24,422 --> 00:25:28,261
There is no secret. You just start shooting one day and deal with the pain.

386
00:25:29,270 --> 00:25:31,249
Somewhere along the line it will get easier.

387
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,670
So you been working on your fade-away?

388
00:25:35,879 --> 00:25:37,514
Fade-away’s soft, man.

389
00:25:38,737 --> 00:25:42,449
Look if the game is on the line and the rock is in my hand, I’m going to the hole.

390
00:25:42,603 --> 00:25:44,276
Every time, that’s my game.

391
00:25:51,010 --> 00:25:52,745
How’d you get him to open the hot tub?

392
00:25:53,048 --> 00:25:54,722
I sweet talked the night manager.

393
00:25:54,993 --> 00:25:58,281
I figured you guys could use it after reworking our entire routine tonight.

394
00:25:58,588 --> 00:25:59,672
Feels good doesn’t it.

395
00:25:59,888 --> 00:26:01,295
Yep. This is great.

396
00:26:03,276 --> 00:26:04,107
Ta Da.

397
00:26:05,537 --> 00:26:07,839
Tutor Girl you look bitchin’.

398
00:26:08,341 --> 00:26:09,647
Yeah I kind of do, don’t I?

399
00:26:10,517 --> 00:26:12,257
Now get your suit. Hot tub therapy.

400
00:26:13,005 --> 00:26:13,881
Both of you.

401
00:26:16,328 --> 00:26:16,973
Haley?

402
00:26:18,930 --> 00:26:21,146
I’m kind of filling in for Theresa.

403
00:26:21,578 --> 00:26:23,962
Works for me. I got a thing for cheerleaders.

404
00:26:24,023 --> 00:26:24,541
Oh yeah?

405
00:26:47,379 --> 00:26:49,501
They needed an extra. What do you think?

406
00:26:49,839 --> 00:26:51,943
I think you look kind of ridiculous.

407
00:26:53,244 --> 00:26:56,101
You do realize that both your former girlfriends are cheerleaders.

408
00:26:56,433 --> 00:26:59,193
Oh right, excuse me. I guess I’m not allowed to have any fun.

409
00:26:59,384 --> 00:27:00,115
That’s not it.

410
00:27:00,704 --> 00:27:03,802
Yeah, that is it. I’m having a good time, I’m happy.

411
00:27:04,236 --> 00:27:06,584
I’d think that my friends would be happy for me too.

412
00:27:06,695 --> 00:27:07,640
Haley get in!

413
00:27:09,395 --> 00:27:10,591
Nathan stop it!

414
00:27:26,901 --> 00:27:32,311
How in the hell am I going to win a ball game with a bunch of hung over idiots?

415
00:27:32,685 --> 00:27:38,301
I don’t know why you got on the damn bus in the first place if you weren’t going to take this serious.

416
00:27:39,315 --> 00:27:42,137
You call yourselves chaperones.

417
00:27:43,447 --> 00:27:44,777
It’s pathetic.

418
00:28:02,469 --> 00:28:04,505
Dude, you got to be kidding me.

419
00:28:06,066 --> 00:28:07,184
It’s 4 A.M.

420
00:28:07,674 --> 00:28:09,574
If I go to sleep now I’ll never wake up.

421
00:28:09,630 --> 00:28:11,396
I’ll be a total waste for the game tomorrow.

422
00:28:13,788 --> 00:28:18,095
It’s classic basketball. I’d give you next but you’d probably hurt yourself again.

423
00:28:18,196 --> 00:28:19,604
What is Whitey doing?

424
00:28:20,557 --> 00:28:23,378
Putting us together on the court and in this room.

425
00:28:23,486 --> 00:28:24,376
He’s just bored.

426
00:28:25,554 --> 00:28:26,219
And evil.

427
00:28:26,752 --> 00:28:29,521
You know, when I was younger I always wanted a little brother.

428
00:28:31,048 --> 00:28:33,669
Then I found out about you. Got over that in a hurry.

429
00:28:39,941 --> 00:28:41,688
What have you been doing to Haley, man?

430
00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:44,482
You were kind of a dick to her tonight.

431
00:28:44,867 --> 00:28:47,263
You know, she used to be this totally original…

432
00:28:48,871 --> 00:28:52,583
Haley. Then you came along.

433
00:28:53,284 --> 00:28:56,416
And as far as I can tell she’s still the same person she’s always been.

434
00:28:56,730 --> 00:28:58,491
The only difference is now she’s with me.

435
00:29:00,314 --> 00:29:02,115
So maybe the problem’s not with her.

436
00:29:02,827 --> 00:29:04,149
Maybe the problem’s with you.

437
00:29:13,974 --> 00:29:17,631
Ladies and Gentlemen, welcome to the Secret Sparkle Classic.

438
00:29:17,902 --> 00:29:20,768
First up, The Bear Creek Warriors.

439
00:29:21,612 --> 00:29:27,128
1...2...3...4. Bear Creek, Warriors.

440
00:29:27,369 --> 00:29:34,394
Champions to beat let’s hear it. Better than the Ravens. You’ll see.

441
00:30:11,646 --> 00:30:15,533
Four time champions Bear Creek Warriors. Led by captain Claire Young.

442
00:30:22,666 --> 00:30:25,629
Okay. I want you guys to think about Theresa.

443
00:30:26,121 --> 00:30:30,364
Lying at home, itchy, and gross and covered in calamine lotion.

444
00:30:30,902 --> 00:30:33,556
The last thing she said to me was, “This Sucks”.

445
00:30:33,893 --> 00:30:36,474
And this will suck unless we win.

446
00:30:37,283 --> 00:30:42,219
Next up at this year’s Sparkle Classic by Secret, the Tree Hill Ravens.

447
00:30:45,721 --> 00:30:48,644
5...6...7...8. RAVENS!

448
00:30:49,577 --> 00:30:50,174
Peyton.

449
00:30:51,229 --> 00:30:55,525
I just want to say thanks, for your help with Haley and the music.

450
00:30:55,577 --> 00:30:58,269
It’s important to you. So it’s important to me too.

451
00:30:58,892 --> 00:30:59,442
Come on.

452
00:31:01,908 --> 00:31:03,175
Let’s Go!

453
00:31:05,227 --> 00:31:07,353
The one, and only.

454
00:31:07,819 --> 00:31:10,199
Blue, black and white.

455
00:31:10,665 --> 00:31:13,153
The best of the best.

456
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:15,985
That’s right.

457
00:32:21,918 --> 00:32:22,940
Haley.

458
00:32:25,054 --> 00:32:26,913
- That’s great.
- Can you believe?

459
00:32:26,965 --> 00:32:28,356
- You did awesome. 
- Thank you.

460
00:32:31,173 --> 00:32:36,790
And second place this year goes to the New Hanover Wild Cats.

461
00:32:40,909 --> 00:32:46,298
And first place in this years Sparkle Classic by Secret goes to…

462
00:32:47,684 --> 00:32:52,975
The Bear Creek Warriors. Five years in a row. Way to go.

463
00:32:56,976 --> 00:32:59,783
Can I borrow you car, hose, and your garage?

464
00:32:59,999 --> 00:33:02,801
Brooke you did a great job. Okay? We all though so.

465
00:33:02,903 --> 00:33:04,171
Not good enough.

466
00:33:04,862 --> 00:33:10,633
And our final award of the competition, for best original choreography, goes to…

467
00:33:11,806 --> 00:33:15,865
Brooke Davis. Captain and Choreographer of the Tree Hill Ravens.

468
00:33:16,005 --> 00:33:16,771
That’s you!

469
00:33:21,050 --> 00:33:21,893
Congratulations.

470
00:33:22,101 --> 00:33:22,803
Thank you.

471
00:33:24,474 --> 00:33:25,307
Yeah Brooke.

472
00:33:26,370 --> 00:33:30,770
And we want to thank all of this years cheering teams on behalf of Secret

473
00:33:30,808 --> 00:33:35,542
and their entire sparkle collection. Thanks for making this years Classics a success.

474
00:33:35,752 --> 00:33:37,088
And Cheer on.

475
00:33:42,372 --> 00:33:43,007
Hey.

476
00:33:43,796 --> 00:33:44,319
Hey.

477
00:33:45,814 --> 00:33:47,225
You were really amazing out there.

478
00:33:47,754 --> 00:33:50,825
Yeah? I thought maybe I looked ridiculous.

479
00:33:54,182 --> 00:33:54,845
Look.

480
00:33:56,422 --> 00:33:57,497
So I was thinking.

481
00:33:58,675 --> 00:34:00,739
Things have been different since you started dating Nathan.

482
00:34:01,741 --> 00:34:04,455
I don’t spend anymore time with him than you did with Brooke.

483
00:34:04,512 --> 00:34:08,127
I know. I know and he’s… your boyfriend.

484
00:34:08,198 --> 00:34:10,677
Of course you’ll want to be with him. It’s just...

485
00:34:12,070 --> 00:34:13,400
I guess I miss my friend.

486
00:34:14,558 --> 00:34:19,529
Luke. I miss you too.

487
00:34:20,266 --> 00:34:24,490
But have you thought about how hard this is on my juggling the two of you guys?

488
00:34:25,422 --> 00:34:28,807
Luke, you’re really important to me. I care about you.

489
00:34:28,863 --> 00:34:30,798
But Nathan is important to me too.

490
00:34:31,151 --> 00:34:35,421
And if you want to be a part of my life, eventually, sooner or later,

491
00:34:35,504 --> 00:34:37,736
you’re gonna have to be a part of his too.

492
00:34:37,987 --> 00:34:38,633
You’re right.

493
00:34:42,832 --> 00:34:45,626
Alright well the game starts in a minute. Want to sit together?

494
00:34:45,657 --> 00:34:47,028
- Hell Yes! 
- Alright.

495
00:34:48,175 --> 00:34:52,727
Oh I’m sorry! I am sorry.

496
00:34:53,336 --> 00:34:54,089
It’s okay.

497
00:34:55,836 --> 00:34:58,631
Fifteen seconds to go, the Tree Hill Ravens are down by one

498
00:34:58,687 --> 00:35:01,165
and could be on the brink of their first loss this season.

499
00:35:01,232 --> 00:35:03,464
Tim, you’re in bound to Nathan up top.

500
00:35:03,823 --> 00:35:06,915
We’re going spread offense. Nathan you find your open shot.

501
00:35:06,996 --> 00:35:10,765
If you can’t we’ll go with Jake. At least he’s not hung over.

502
00:35:11,221 --> 00:35:14,867
Let’s go fellas, come on. Raven’s on three. 1...2...3... Ravens!

503
00:35:18,325 --> 00:35:21,035
Get out the Tupperware folks. If the Raven’s don’t score

504
00:35:21,071 --> 00:35:24,005
we’ll have to save Coach Durham’s 500th win cake for another night.

505
00:35:24,061 --> 00:35:25,091
Go Nathan!

506
00:35:25,501 --> 00:35:28,363
Fifteen seconds left and the Ravens need a basket to win it.

507
00:35:28,562 --> 00:35:31,480
The inbound to Nathan Scott and he is immediately double teamed.

508
00:35:31,675 --> 00:35:34,481
He’s gonna have to give it up. He does. Finds Tim Smith.

509
00:35:34,604 --> 00:35:37,281
Tim with the ball. The time is running down. Back to Nathan.

510
00:35:37,410 --> 00:35:40,538
Eight seconds now. Now seven. Nathan dribbles and tries to drive

511
00:35:40,579 --> 00:35:41,946
but he can’t get through the double team.

512
00:35:42,149 --> 00:35:44,762
He’s gonna have to do something. Three seconds. Now two.

513
00:35:44,936 --> 00:35:48,224
Nathan spins up top and puts up the fade-away. It’s Good!

514
00:35:50,870 --> 00:35:55,939
Unbelievable! In a season of impossible finishes, Nathan Scott nailed the fade-away jumper.

515
00:35:55,985 --> 00:35:59,472
The Ravens reign undefeated and Coach Durham’s won 500 games.

516
00:35:59,851 --> 00:36:02,544
Hey. Were you rooting for Nathan?

517
00:36:03,548 --> 00:36:05,114
I was rooting for the team.

518
00:36:05,605 --> 00:36:07,382
Whatever you say.

519
00:36:25,146 --> 00:36:28,210
I make this shot, you get your asses back to work.

520
00:36:36,850 --> 00:36:37,815
Let’s go.

521
00:36:39,764 --> 00:36:43,781
Hey. I expect this from Keith but you’re supposed to be me when I’m not here.

522
00:36:44,278 --> 00:36:45,112
Get back to work.

523
00:36:46,926 --> 00:36:49,766
Why don’t you just lighten up, Dan? We were taking a break.

524
00:36:49,843 --> 00:36:51,380
Well break’s over, Axel Rose.

525
00:36:52,055 --> 00:36:55,301
You never had a strong work ethic. If you did, it would still be your name up on that sign.

526
00:36:55,562 --> 00:36:57,645
You know what? I’m done.

527
00:36:57,912 --> 00:36:59,182
We close shop at six.

528
00:36:59,255 --> 00:37:02,479
No, I’m taking Nathan’s lead and I’m getting the hell away from you.

529
00:37:02,818 --> 00:37:03,888
What is the matter with you?

530
00:37:04,927 --> 00:37:08,402
I do everything I can to help you keep your business and all you do is give me attitude.

531
00:37:08,445 --> 00:37:10,672
And all you do is lorded over me.

532
00:37:13,907 --> 00:37:17,240
Well thanks for the help, Dan. But I don’t want it anymore.

533
00:37:17,532 --> 00:37:19,971
You can take the shop. I quit.

534
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:25,633
- Thank you so much.
- Alright.

535
00:37:29,831 --> 00:37:33,148
Hey Mouth. Part of this belongs to you, you know.

536
00:37:33,543 --> 00:37:35,735
Well we could share it. Trade off weeks?

537
00:37:35,807 --> 00:37:37,696
Uh, let me think about it… No.

538
00:37:38,213 --> 00:37:39,452
- Bye.
- Bye.

539
00:37:40,532 --> 00:37:43,281
Brooke. Hey. You’re uniform.

540
00:37:43,538 --> 00:37:45,825
It didn’t fit all that well anyways, so.

541
00:37:46,522 --> 00:37:49,334
You really saved us this weekend. Thanks, Haley.

542
00:37:53,096 --> 00:37:54,623
Did she just call me Haley?

543
00:37:57,951 --> 00:37:59,901
You know I would have hit that shot with or without you.

544
00:38:00,607 --> 00:38:02,079
Not if I was guarding you.

545
00:38:02,773 --> 00:38:04,375
Get your ass back and we’ll see.

546
00:38:05,329 --> 00:38:06,696
- Alright. 
- Hey guys.

547
00:38:09,988 --> 00:38:11,063
This is a first.

548
00:38:11,984 --> 00:38:14,054
Haley! Hey what’s up?

549
00:38:14,202 --> 00:38:14,760
Hey.

550
00:38:15,185 --> 00:38:17,653
- Who’s that? 
- I have no idea.

551
00:38:18,042 --> 00:38:20,798
Well I guess that’s a first too. Alright I’ll see you guys later.

552
00:38:20,871 --> 00:38:21,820
Okay. Bye.

553
00:38:22,321 --> 00:38:22,829
Bye.

554
00:38:24,942 --> 00:38:27,008
Hear that? He said you guys.

555
00:38:27,049 --> 00:38:30,213
Easy, match maker. So I’m headed back to the apartment.

556
00:38:30,663 --> 00:38:32,511
You sure you don’t want to get that cheerleading uniform back?

557
00:38:32,567 --> 00:38:33,351
Shut up!

558
00:38:39,568 --> 00:38:42,807
Okay. Is my dad flirting with your mom?

559
00:38:43,242 --> 00:38:44,866
Could he be any more obvious?

560
00:38:46,618 --> 00:38:47,907
This is too weird.

561
00:38:49,684 --> 00:38:50,513
Yeah, weird.

562
00:39:06,382 --> 00:39:08,276
Think Claire Young is still in shock?

563
00:39:08,595 --> 00:39:11,898
Look, Peyton, it was really fun to get caught up in the weekend

564
00:39:11,950 --> 00:39:13,789
and forget about all the crap between us.

565
00:39:13,891 --> 00:39:14,757
Yeah, it was.

566
00:39:15,274 --> 00:39:17,005
But it doesn’t change what you did.

567
00:39:18,141 --> 00:39:21,537
Okay? We’re not friends anymore, we’re just on the same squad.

568
00:39:23,415 --> 00:39:26,988
Brooke, you might not be my friend, but I’m still yours.

569
00:39:27,474 --> 00:39:29,928
And I’m going to prove it to you.

570
00:39:32,334 --> 00:39:33,312
I’ll see ya.

571
00:40:04,544 --> 00:40:06,669
- Hey. 
- Hey.

572
00:40:07,330 --> 00:40:10,488
- I’m sorry that I missed our dinner. 
- Oh you must be Keith.

573
00:40:10,843 --> 00:40:11,395
Hi.

574
00:40:11,666 --> 00:40:15,767
This is Larry Sawyer. He’s Peyton’s dad. We chaperoned together this weekend.

575
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:19,927
More like Whitey chaperoned us. She’s trouble if you keep her up after midnight.

576
00:40:21,498 --> 00:40:24,263
So how was your weekend? We miss anything in Tree Hill?

577
00:40:24,641 --> 00:40:25,388
Not really.

578
00:40:28,485 --> 00:40:29,520
You want some coffee?

579
00:40:29,623 --> 00:40:34,732
You know I just remembered I have to... pick up an oil filter so...

580
00:40:34,789 --> 00:40:35,828
It was nice to meet you Larry.

581
00:40:36,801 --> 00:40:37,445
See ya.

582
00:41:56,007 --> 00:41:57,237
That’s one.
