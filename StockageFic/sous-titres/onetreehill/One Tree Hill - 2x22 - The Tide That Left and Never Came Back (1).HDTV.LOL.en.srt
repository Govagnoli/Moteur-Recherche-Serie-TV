1
00:00:00,323 --> 00:00:01,769
Previously on One Tree Hill.

2
00:00:01,820 --> 00:00:03,054
I have a right to my daughter.

3
00:00:03,704 --> 00:00:04,641
You’re not getting her.

4
00:00:10,605 --> 00:00:12,029
Petition for annulment?

5
00:00:12,592 --> 00:00:14,250
It’ll be like the marriage never happened.

6
00:00:14,994 --> 00:00:18,167
There’s... no way that he signed this.

7
00:00:18,290 --> 00:00:19,382
It’s over, Haley.

8
00:00:20,994 --> 00:00:21,932
Jake Jagielski.

9
00:00:23,048 --> 00:00:24,744
You have the right to remain silent.

10
00:00:25,747 --> 00:00:26,606
I love you.

11
00:00:27,236 --> 00:00:28,331
I love you, too.

12
00:00:29,042 --> 00:00:29,964
Did we have fun?

13
00:00:30,487 --> 00:00:31,382
You tell me.

14
00:00:37,127 --> 00:00:37,967
It’s okay, Deb...

15
00:00:39,274 --> 00:00:40,441
I’ll be here when you get out.

16
00:00:49,502 --> 00:00:50,930
I’m coming home tomorrow, okay?

17
00:00:51,432 --> 00:00:52,682
Don’t come home, Haley.

18
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:53,593
Nathan...

19
00:00:53,778 --> 00:00:55,170
Coz I don’t want you to.

20
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:49,847
And Hansel said to Gretel...

21
00:01:51,189 --> 00:01:53,033
let us drop these breadcrumbs...

22
00:01:54,301 --> 00:01:56,443
so that together we find our way home.

23
00:01:57,872 --> 00:02:00,594
Because losing our way would be the most cruel of things.

24
00:02:02,776 --> 00:02:03,518
This year...

25
00:02:04,649 --> 00:02:05,806
I lost my way.

26
00:02:10,727 --> 00:02:13,144
And losing your way on a journey is unfortunate.

27
00:02:14,382 --> 00:02:16,419
But, losing your reason for the journey...

28
00:02:17,317 --> 00:02:18,817
is a fate more cruel.

29
00:02:21,566 --> 00:02:23,394
The journey lasted eight months.

30
00:02:24,408 --> 00:02:26,118
Sometimes I travelled alone...

31
00:02:28,243 --> 00:02:30,557
Sometimes, there were others who took the wheel...

32
00:02:32,170 --> 00:02:33,337
and took my heart.

33
00:02:35,564 --> 00:02:37,439
But when the destination was reached...

34
00:02:38,099 --> 00:02:39,789
it wasn’t me who arrived...

35
00:02:41,586 --> 00:02:42,861
it wasn’t me at all.

36
00:02:55,004 --> 00:02:57,924
And once you lose yourself, you have two choices:

37
00:02:58,024 --> 00:02:58,820
Bye!

38
00:03:03,269 --> 00:03:05,132
Find the person you used to be...

39
00:03:08,737 --> 00:03:10,586
or lose that person completely.

40
00:03:12,352 --> 00:03:15,715
Because, sometimes, you have to step outside of the person you’ve been.

41
00:03:16,376 --> 00:03:18,705
And remember the person you were meant to be.

42
00:03:19,643 --> 00:03:21,098
The person you wanted to be.

43
00:03:22,399 --> 00:03:25,806
- Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy...
- The person you are.

44
00:03:27,552 --> 00:03:30,395
Tree Hill student council is pleased to welcome-

45
00:03:30,605 --> 00:03:34,747
No. As president of the student council, I promised you guys a good time...

46
00:03:35,531 --> 00:03:38,177
I’m Brooke Davis and I’m an idiot, but, please welcome-

47
00:03:39,074 --> 00:03:40,961
Jimmy Eat World, that’s a great idea!

48
00:03:41,055 --> 00:03:42,299
Brooke, it’ll probably never happen.

49
00:03:42,413 --> 00:03:46,362
Peyton Elizabeth Sawyer, you got The Wreckers and Pelthead to come and play;

50
00:03:46,421 --> 00:03:48,741
you can totally land Jimmy Eat World and when you do,

51
00:03:48,791 --> 00:03:51,679
I promise I won’t break up with you to run off and join their tour.

52
00:03:54,854 --> 00:03:55,985
That’s it, isn’t it?

53
00:03:56,829 --> 00:04:00,679
That’s why your heart’s not totally in to finding a great band for the end of the school year.

54
00:04:01,146 --> 00:04:02,273
Haley and Nathan.

55
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:06,267
Yeah. That, and-

56
00:04:07,618 --> 00:04:08,489
Jake.

57
00:04:09,482 --> 00:04:11,529
You’ve been calling my attorneys a lot.

58
00:04:12,073 --> 00:04:13,279
I thought I could help.

59
00:04:13,368 --> 00:04:15,282
Well, you just pissed them off.

60
00:04:17,468 --> 00:04:19,609
There are two tragedy’s in life:-

61
00:04:20,157 --> 00:04:22,692
one is to lose your heart’s desire.

62
00:04:23,189 --> 00:04:25,134
The other is to gain it.

63
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:30,218
Now the little that Shaw realised at the time that his words would be the basis of your final.

64
00:04:30,883 --> 00:04:34,974
I’d like you to write an essay on the meaning of Shaw’s quote.

65
00:04:35,266 --> 00:04:37,288
It’s due on Monday...

66
00:04:37,392 --> 00:04:39,521
and then your school year will be over.

67
00:04:48,451 --> 00:04:51,133
I guess Haley’s not coming back after all, huh?

68
00:05:03,263 --> 00:05:04,277
Game to eleven?

69
00:05:05,142 --> 00:05:06,550
I’ll give you ten and the ball.

70
00:05:09,521 --> 00:05:10,370
Game.

71
00:05:11,327 --> 00:05:12,131
See?

72
00:05:13,293 --> 00:05:14,650
You’ll be back in no time.

73
00:05:14,788 --> 00:05:17,020
Shooting weak-ass jump shots: that’s your game.

74
00:05:17,716 --> 00:05:19,473
I can hardly jump, man.

75
00:05:20,041 --> 00:05:22,745
Look, I know you don’t wanna hear this, but if you blow off this English final,

76
00:05:22,811 --> 00:05:26,892
you’re not gonna even be eligible to shoot the... ‘weak-ass jump shots’.

77
00:05:29,529 --> 00:05:32,120
It’s about loss. I can help you if you want.

78
00:05:33,558 --> 00:05:35,207
You don’t think I can write about loss?

79
00:05:41,872 --> 00:05:43,086
Hey sexy!

80
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:45,288
What’s wrong?

81
00:05:45,646 --> 00:05:48,566
I’m dead. I tanked my calculus final.

82
00:05:48,745 --> 00:05:50,786
Are you sure? Maybe you did okay.

83
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:53,947
Erica, we hung out all week and I was totally unprepared.

84
00:05:54,263 --> 00:05:57,079
And you can’t exactly bluff your way through math, you know?

85
00:05:58,365 --> 00:06:00,351
God, my parents are gonna kill me.

86
00:06:04,673 --> 00:06:05,241
Hey.

87
00:06:06,219 --> 00:06:06,797
Hey.

88
00:06:07,964 --> 00:06:09,787
You wanna go on a road trip this weekend?

89
00:06:10,376 --> 00:06:11,396
Okay, where?

90
00:06:11,636 --> 00:06:13,367
New York, to see Haley.

91
00:06:13,982 --> 00:06:17,452
Alright, odd I know, coming from me, but we do have finals.

92
00:06:17,607 --> 00:06:18,451
The essay.

93
00:06:18,768 --> 00:06:22,823
I’ll bring my laptop. Whoever sits shotgun can do the typing; whaddaya say, huh?

94
00:06:24,237 --> 00:06:25,399
And why Haley?

95
00:06:25,757 --> 00:06:26,627
Why now?

96
00:06:26,796 --> 00:06:28,219
Because we started the year together...

97
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:31,087
and I can’t end it without seeing her.

98
00:06:37,169 --> 00:06:39,746
Okay. I’ll go, we can talk.

99
00:06:39,821 --> 00:06:40,805
We need to talk.

100
00:06:41,112 --> 00:06:42,065
What’s wrong?

101
00:06:42,622 --> 00:06:46,186
Well, I don’t want you to be alarmed, but, my mother took a spill in New Zealand.

102
00:06:47,168 --> 00:06:48,551
That’s terrible.

103
00:06:49,386 --> 00:06:50,687
She’s asked me to come home.

104
00:06:51,286 --> 00:06:52,452
Well, you have to.

105
00:06:54,536 --> 00:06:57,348
And I don’t know how long for, coz there’s a bit more to it.

106
00:07:02,970 --> 00:07:05,160
I may have a problem coming back into the States;

107
00:07:05,934 --> 00:07:08,601
I’m not a citizen and, well,

108
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,872
Dan’s trying to get me deported.

109
00:07:16,410 --> 00:07:17,300
Deported?!

110
00:07:17,694 --> 00:07:18,964
What is wrong with you?!

111
00:07:19,328 --> 00:07:21,556
Why can't you simply stay out of my life?!

112
00:07:21,831 --> 00:07:22,891
Why can’t you?

113
00:07:22,963 --> 00:07:26,710
Oh, please, I’ve been ignoring you for the last seventeen years!

114
00:07:26,784 --> 00:07:27,607
Have you?

115
00:07:28,695 --> 00:07:31,093
Coz you’ve been coming around quite a bit, Karen.

116
00:07:31,595 --> 00:07:33,808
I mean, with all your anger and outrage.

117
00:07:34,657 --> 00:07:35,917
Some would call it...

118
00:07:37,161 --> 00:07:38,036
passion.

119
00:07:38,401 --> 00:07:39,768
Don’t flatter yourself.

120
00:07:40,166 --> 00:07:42,148
Just back off Andy and Lucas.

121
00:07:42,214 --> 00:07:43,668
And leave my world alone.

122
00:07:49,633 --> 00:07:51,108
Isn’t that what this is really about?

123
00:07:51,856 --> 00:07:52,593
God!

124
00:08:10,461 --> 00:08:13,068
Next time... that’ll be your face!

125
00:08:21,301 --> 00:08:22,991
You guys ready for the summer?

126
00:08:26,567 --> 00:08:27,816
Yeah, me too.

127
00:08:27,998 --> 00:08:32,125
But, first, let’s give it up for the girl who made this happen tonight;

128
00:08:32,186 --> 00:08:34,716
my bestest friend: Peyton Sawyer.

129
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:41,438
Peyton, Peyton, Peyton...

130
00:08:50,218 --> 00:08:51,079
Jake...

131
00:08:52,027 --> 00:08:53,889
You’ve been calling my attorneys a lot.

132
00:08:54,770 --> 00:08:55,857
I thought I could help.

133
00:08:56,067 --> 00:08:57,890
Well, you just pissed them off...

134
00:09:00,275 --> 00:09:01,268
at first.

135
00:09:02,645 --> 00:09:06,505
Then, you clearly weren’t going away, so they went over Nikki’s testimony line by line.

136
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:08,666
And they found something.

137
00:09:09,793 --> 00:09:10,960
She lied, Peyton.

138
00:09:11,686 --> 00:09:14,693
She said that she’d been away at college but she wasn’t.

139
00:09:14,764 --> 00:09:16,229
She hadn’t been there in months.

140
00:09:16,398 --> 00:09:19,506
Well does, does that even matter, you know? Is that enough?

141
00:09:19,583 --> 00:09:21,775
Yeah, any lie is a lie under oath.

142
00:09:21,876 --> 00:09:24,135
Once my attorneys get a hold of her transcripts,

143
00:09:24,467 --> 00:09:26,071
the judge is gonna lift the court order;

144
00:09:26,141 --> 00:09:29,095
I’ll have sole custody of Jenny for a new hearing.

145
00:09:29,178 --> 00:09:31,471
And a chance to testify against all her other lies.

146
00:09:31,861 --> 00:09:34,978
That’s... that’s so great, Jake.

147
00:09:37,461 --> 00:09:38,685
When d’ya get out?

148
00:09:38,839 --> 00:09:40,199
A day or so, probably.

149
00:09:40,784 --> 00:09:42,730
And I’m gonna come find you as soon as I do.

150
00:09:43,856 --> 00:09:45,213
You did this, Peyton.

151
00:09:45,884 --> 00:09:49,201
You’ve given me hope; and I love you so much for it.

152
00:09:50,801 --> 00:09:52,914
Hey, hey, come on, don’t cry.

153
00:09:53,155 --> 00:09:55,423
Haven’t you ever cried when your happy?

154
00:10:08,213 --> 00:10:09,277
Come in, Nathan.

155
00:10:10,801 --> 00:10:11,986
How’d you know it was me?

156
00:10:12,293 --> 00:10:14,055
I can smell the confusion.

157
00:10:17,404 --> 00:10:19,205
That was a joke by the way.

158
00:10:20,793 --> 00:10:23,230
Nobody ever laughs at my jokes.

159
00:10:23,541 --> 00:10:24,919
That’s coz they’re not funny, Coach.

160
00:10:26,522 --> 00:10:29,246
Little bird told me you were moving back home.

161
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,955
That little bird’s name Lucas?

162
00:10:32,953 --> 00:10:34,105
He cares about you.

163
00:10:35,973 --> 00:10:36,972
So do I.

164
00:10:38,774 --> 00:10:41,077
You’ve come quite a distance this year.

165
00:10:42,588 --> 00:10:45,460
I think moving out of that house has been good for you.

166
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:46,608
Coach.

167
00:10:47,407 --> 00:10:48,169
Look at me.

168
00:10:48,985 --> 00:10:49,798
I’m a mess.

169
00:10:50,724 --> 00:10:52,803
Nah, you’re just a little bit broken.

170
00:10:53,632 --> 00:10:56,914
But it’s nothing that a summer at High Flyers couldn’t fix.

171
00:10:57,022 --> 00:10:59,048
- Could’ve fixed. 
- Still can.

172
00:10:59,489 --> 00:11:02,306
Dan Scott’s not the only one with pull in this town.

173
00:11:03,114 --> 00:11:07,524
The only thing that held you back as a player last season was heart...

174
00:11:08,218 --> 00:11:11,370
and I’ve watched that change over the past year.

175
00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:14,221
And I’ve been so proud of you.

176
00:11:17,487 --> 00:11:20,753
That camp has world class trainers.

177
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:23,600
They can mend the physical part.

178
00:11:24,615 --> 00:11:26,881
I have a hunch, once that happens,

179
00:11:27,569 --> 00:11:29,370
the game will heal your heart.

180
00:11:31,116 --> 00:11:32,289
I dreamt about it;

181
00:11:32,954 --> 00:11:33,927
in the hospital...

182
00:11:34,517 --> 00:11:36,021
about going to that camp.

183
00:11:37,475 --> 00:11:38,366
I don’t know.

184
00:11:40,282 --> 00:11:41,808
My mom’s coming home soon.

185
00:11:42,878 --> 00:11:44,122
Gotta think about it.

186
00:11:48,069 --> 00:11:49,788
Promise me you’ll do that.

187
00:12:04,786 --> 00:12:07,909
How great is this? Dinner together, steaks on the grill.

188
00:12:07,976 --> 00:12:09,020
You not punching me.

189
00:12:12,005 --> 00:12:13,638
So I got some good news today.

190
00:12:13,731 --> 00:12:14,631
What’s that?

191
00:12:15,093 --> 00:12:17,171
Whitey thinks he can get me back into High Flyers.

192
00:12:19,193 --> 00:12:21,897
Well, as much as I love hearing you talk about basketball again,

193
00:12:22,496 --> 00:12:24,636
I really don’t think camp’s a smart play for you right now.

194
00:12:24,892 --> 00:12:27,412
- Dad, its High Flyers. 
- Exactly my point.

195
00:12:27,693 --> 00:12:30,555
You’re injured Nathan. You don’t want the scouts to see you like that.

196
00:12:30,707 --> 00:12:32,285
Plus, there’s your mother to consider.

197
00:12:34,221 --> 00:12:36,187
Listen, I don’t like to burden you with these things

198
00:12:36,234 --> 00:12:38,266
but you’re a man so I’m gonna be honest with you.

199
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:42,832
Your mother’s pill addiction started when you moved out.

200
00:12:44,948 --> 00:12:47,048
Now, in no way does that mean you’re to blame, coz you’re not.

201
00:12:47,139 --> 00:12:50,606
But... she’s gonna be vulnerable when she comes home.

202
00:12:50,816 --> 00:12:52,709
And she’s gonna need you more than ever.

203
00:12:58,982 --> 00:13:03,068
Okay, guys, as student council president, I have one final duty

204
00:13:03,113 --> 00:13:04,849
before the summer begins and this is it.

205
00:13:04,925 --> 00:13:07,966
Tree Hill High, school is out and it is time to party!

206
00:13:08,065 --> 00:13:10,477
Please welcome Jimmy Eat World!

207
00:14:10,304 --> 00:14:11,313
So, it’s kinda weird;

208
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:13,981
us... living under the same roof.

209
00:14:15,101 --> 00:14:16,233
Isn’t that weird.

210
00:14:17,231 --> 00:14:18,337
Yes it is.

211
00:14:18,756 --> 00:14:21,670
I mean, who would have thought this could have happened back when...

212
00:14:22,253 --> 00:14:23,272
we were together?

213
00:14:28,669 --> 00:14:30,619
You been talking to Peyton much?

214
00:14:31,076 --> 00:14:32,039
Little bit.

215
00:14:33,492 --> 00:14:35,530
I wish I was in her life more, you know?

216
00:14:38,635 --> 00:14:41,813
Guess I know what loss you’ll be writing about for your essay.

217
00:14:43,104 --> 00:14:45,073
I lost myself this year, Brooke.

218
00:14:46,272 --> 00:14:49,415
And what I did, I lost the people I truly care about.

219
00:14:51,321 --> 00:14:52,554
Oh, by the way, um...

220
00:14:53,763 --> 00:14:55,309
when we get to New York...

221
00:14:55,852 --> 00:14:58,653
I hope you’ll understand if we spend most of our time with Haley.

222
00:14:58,765 --> 00:15:02,738
It’s just... important that I focus on her today.

223
00:15:03,358 --> 00:15:04,095
You know?

224
00:15:04,767 --> 00:15:05,697
Of course.

225
00:15:07,575 --> 00:15:09,133
Everything else can wait.

226
00:16:29,089 --> 00:16:30,096
Lucas!

227
00:16:31,785 --> 00:16:34,024
Oh my gosh! Hi.

228
00:16:34,112 --> 00:16:38,196
Oh, well, it’s about time the tribal leaders came to collect their squaw.

229
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:39,528
Oh, shut up, Chris.

230
00:16:39,886 --> 00:16:42,077
Yeah, shut up, Chris.

231
00:16:42,226 --> 00:16:43,336
Alright, I’m going.

232
00:16:45,723 --> 00:16:48,729
Oh... I see you couldn’t stay away from me.

233
00:16:48,831 --> 00:16:49,700
Out!

234
00:16:51,325 --> 00:16:54,452
I’m sorry. Oh, it’s good to see you too, Brooke.

235
00:16:55,292 --> 00:16:57,515
Yeah, you too, fugitive girl.

236
00:16:58,533 --> 00:17:00,002
Well, so what’re you guys doing here?

237
00:17:00,095 --> 00:17:01,758
We bought your English assignment.

238
00:17:01,837 --> 00:17:04,069
My- Oh my gosh, finals!

239
00:17:04,154 --> 00:17:06,423
Oh, god, that just feels like a totally different life.

240
00:17:07,390 --> 00:17:08,440
Let’s go, diva.

241
00:17:08,702 --> 00:17:11,870
Hey, Joey D, this is my friend Lucas and my friend Brooke.

242
00:17:11,952 --> 00:17:13,909
What’s up, guys? Ah, sorry I gotta drag her away

243
00:17:13,971 --> 00:17:16,515
but we’ve got three meetings and a satellite radio interview.

244
00:17:16,592 --> 00:17:17,907
- You ready? 
- Um...

245
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:23,364
I’m just feeling a little... flu... ish.

246
00:17:23,677 --> 00:17:24,409
Haley...

247
00:17:24,518 --> 00:17:25,234
Yeah, I-

248
00:17:26,790 --> 00:17:28,552
It’s totally going around.

249
00:17:31,174 --> 00:17:32,223
Cover for me?

250
00:17:32,372 --> 00:17:34,758
Really, because I’m just, I’m sick as a dog here.

251
00:17:34,942 --> 00:17:37,191
No, no, wait Haley, no, no, wait... guys?

252
00:17:38,069 --> 00:17:39,140
I’m gonna be sick

253
00:17:39,509 --> 00:17:40,507
It’ll be okay.

254
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:42,489
Dan can’t actually affect me legally.

255
00:17:42,626 --> 00:17:44,746
Yeah, but if you leave the country, then-

256
00:17:44,844 --> 00:17:48,842
Yes, it could create a bit of red tape that would hold up my return to the states.

257
00:17:52,401 --> 00:17:53,549
I’m gonna miss you.

258
00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:56,507
Unless you come with me.

259
00:17:58,468 --> 00:17:59,456
Bring Lucas.

260
00:18:00,111 --> 00:18:01,125
Take the summer...

261
00:18:02,569 --> 00:18:04,065
few years beyond that.

262
00:18:04,215 --> 00:18:06,277
Oh, Andy, I would love to.

263
00:18:06,379 --> 00:18:08,943
Honestly, there is nothing I would want more...

264
00:18:09,651 --> 00:18:10,542
but...

265
00:18:12,061 --> 00:18:15,682
with Deb’s troubles and the businesses and-

266
00:18:15,917 --> 00:18:16,706
Keith.

267
00:18:22,538 --> 00:18:24,545
Come on in! What do you think?

268
00:18:24,738 --> 00:18:27,228
No this is what I’m talking about.

269
00:18:27,421 --> 00:18:29,675
So... what-...

270
00:18:30,309 --> 00:18:31,656
what do you guys wanna do today?

271
00:18:31,758 --> 00:18:34,765
Wanna... take a limo to see the city? You wanna-

272
00:18:34,851 --> 00:18:36,833
I was thinking maybe we could just talk.

273
00:18:37,989 --> 00:18:38,916
Yeah.

274
00:18:40,479 --> 00:18:45,076
Um... I’m in New York city and my parents have resumed allowances;

275
00:18:45,153 --> 00:18:49,986
I would be crazy not to shop right now so I’m gonna leave you two alone. Okay?

276
00:18:50,447 --> 00:18:51,599
Good luck, see ya, bye.

277
00:19:01,164 --> 00:19:03,836
What you walked in on in the dressing room was innocent.

278
00:19:03,928 --> 00:19:04,589
Sure.

279
00:19:04,696 --> 00:19:07,436
It was, look, I’m not with Chris, okay?

280
00:19:08,265 --> 00:19:10,082
We were just kidding around like...

281
00:19:10,205 --> 00:19:11,727
We used to do?

282
00:19:15,458 --> 00:19:16,212
Yeah.

283
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:23,215
I miss you so much.

284
00:19:31,966 --> 00:19:33,158
I’m sorry, Danny.

285
00:19:34,392 --> 00:19:36,123
Oh, this oughta be good.

286
00:19:36,472 --> 00:19:37,424
For what?

287
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:39,549
Whatever you need me to be sorry for.

288
00:19:39,702 --> 00:19:42,088
Well, that’s a long list of screw-ups, Whitey.

289
00:19:42,309 --> 00:19:44,008
I take the blame for all of them...

290
00:19:44,331 --> 00:19:46,809
if it’ll help get Nathan into High Flyers.

291
00:19:47,203 --> 00:19:48,851
Ah, I see.

292
00:19:49,471 --> 00:19:51,264
You didn’t come here to apologise;

293
00:19:51,678 --> 00:19:53,234
you came to negotiate.

294
00:19:53,563 --> 00:19:55,533
I came to say I’m sorry.

295
00:19:56,225 --> 00:19:58,333
Dan, you were a great player...

296
00:19:58,917 --> 00:20:01,027
maybe I was a lousy coach...

297
00:20:01,550 --> 00:20:04,693
maybe I shoulda listened to you more and eased up a little bit.

298
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:10,580
But... we can bury all that now and do what’s best for Nathan.

299
00:20:10,704 --> 00:20:12,900
And you think High Flyers is what’s good for him?

300
00:20:13,043 --> 00:20:15,389
I think... he needs to get away...

301
00:20:15,476 --> 00:20:18,444
and bathe himself in the game that you taught him to love.

302
00:20:19,341 --> 00:20:20,519
The game that...

303
00:20:21,158 --> 00:20:24,503
gave you all the hopes and dreams that it gave me.

304
00:20:25,783 --> 00:20:28,808
If saying ‘I’m sorry’ will help your son;

305
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:32,745
a kid who, by the way, I think the world of...

306
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:35,029
then I’m sorry.

307
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:36,324
I was wrong.

308
00:20:37,518 --> 00:20:39,365
And I mean that sincerely.

309
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:44,496
You know what, Whitey, you’re right.

310
00:20:46,709 --> 00:20:48,377
I was a great player...

311
00:20:50,133 --> 00:20:52,002
and you were a lousy coach.

312
00:20:52,981 --> 00:20:54,055
You still are.

313
00:21:03,481 --> 00:21:04,357
Erica.

314
00:21:04,567 --> 00:21:05,697
Come on, Mouth...

315
00:21:06,026 --> 00:21:07,890
give me some... mouth.

316
00:21:08,468 --> 00:21:10,066
You’re supposed to be helping me.

317
00:21:10,178 --> 00:21:13,558
Take it from someone who was obsessed with trying to be perfect:

318
00:21:13,957 --> 00:21:15,739
It’s not about perfect.

319
00:21:16,169 --> 00:21:19,092
It’s about living your life and doing the best you can.

320
00:21:21,535 --> 00:21:23,617
You’re pretty great, you know that?

321
00:21:23,735 --> 00:21:24,555
Yes.

322
00:21:25,451 --> 00:21:27,879
I’m so great... that I’ll make you a deal:

323
00:21:28,974 --> 00:21:31,018
for every sentence you write of your essay...

324
00:21:31,882 --> 00:21:33,402
I’ll give you a kiss.

325
00:21:35,093 --> 00:21:37,095
You think I could get an advance?

326
00:21:47,053 --> 00:21:48,532
Jake’s getting outta jail!

327
00:21:49,142 --> 00:21:51,343
Ah, that’s... that’s great, Peyton.

328
00:21:51,409 --> 00:21:54,257
He’s getting Jenny back, too, so I’m gonna go see him right now.

329
00:21:54,754 --> 00:21:55,757
Tell him I said ‘hey’.

330
00:21:59,412 --> 00:22:00,289
Hey, Nathan?

331
00:22:01,579 --> 00:22:03,135
I’m sorry I’m happy.

332
00:22:05,604 --> 00:22:07,318
Sometimes they come back, right?

333
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,264
Jagielski, long window.

334
00:22:18,039 --> 00:22:19,468
Peyton, you don’t have to-

335
00:22:36,958 --> 00:22:37,900
Hi, Jake.

336
00:22:38,428 --> 00:22:39,973
How’s your sex life in there?

337
00:22:40,203 --> 00:22:41,386
What d’ya want, Nikki?

338
00:22:41,766 --> 00:22:43,404
I just came to say goodbye.

339
00:22:44,068 --> 00:22:45,811
You’re leaving before the hearing?

340
00:22:45,897 --> 00:22:48,525
Yeah... this game’s gotten old.

341
00:22:48,616 --> 00:22:50,157
Well, I guess it’s just as well.

342
00:22:50,607 --> 00:22:54,406
Once the judge hears my side of things, it’s not gonna matter if you’re there or not. You know it.

343
00:22:54,554 --> 00:22:56,251
Do you know how it feels, Jake?

344
00:22:56,572 --> 00:22:58,819
Knowing that you’ll never see your daughter again?

345
00:22:59,333 --> 00:23:01,416
Knowing that she’ll never be a part of your life?

346
00:23:02,275 --> 00:23:03,817
You’ll never see her walk...

347
00:23:04,428 --> 00:23:07,073
hear her laugh or watch her grow.

348
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:12,470
Goodbye, Nikki.

349
00:23:13,812 --> 00:23:14,876
Goodbye, Jake.

350
00:23:17,258 --> 00:23:18,527
Oh, one more thing.

351
00:23:19,014 --> 00:23:19,782
Yeah.

352
00:23:19,879 --> 00:23:21,998
The next time you wanna hide my daughter...

353
00:23:22,327 --> 00:23:24,339
you’ve gotta do better that Florida.

354
00:23:35,982 --> 00:23:37,789
Do you know how it feels, Jake?

355
00:23:38,086 --> 00:23:40,031
Never to see your daughter again?

356
00:23:40,237 --> 00:23:41,482
Because you will.

357
00:23:41,645 --> 00:23:42,464
Nikki!

358
00:23:42,658 --> 00:23:44,539
Say goodbye to daddy, bunny.

359
00:23:45,439 --> 00:23:46,463
Forever.

360
00:23:47,446 --> 00:23:48,234
Nikki!

361
00:23:52,045 --> 00:23:52,890
Guard!

362
00:23:53,339 --> 00:23:54,026
Nikki!

363
00:23:54,256 --> 00:23:57,280
Somebody stop her! She’s got my baby! Nikki, come on!

364
00:23:57,517 --> 00:23:58,383
Nikki!

365
00:23:59,463 --> 00:24:00,436
Nikki!

366
00:24:04,153 --> 00:24:05,607
I’m guessing you’re here because of Nathan.

367
00:24:07,292 --> 00:24:08,382
Kind of.

368
00:24:09,206 --> 00:24:12,308
You know that he told me not to come home, right? You know that?

369
00:24:14,490 --> 00:24:18,232
Look, mostly, I’m here because of us, Haley.

370
00:24:19,836 --> 00:24:23,232
You know, I was... sitting in class... and...

371
00:24:24,187 --> 00:24:26,394
I looked over and saw your empty seat...

372
00:24:26,527 --> 00:24:27,762
and it struck me;

373
00:24:28,195 --> 00:24:30,163
that not too long ago, it was just you and me.

374
00:24:30,699 --> 00:24:31,524
Yeah.

375
00:24:33,250 --> 00:24:36,050
Suddenly, it felt wrong; that you weren’t there.

376
00:24:38,287 --> 00:24:39,948
You think I was wrong for leaving.

377
00:24:45,747 --> 00:24:46,910
Here’s what I think:

378
00:24:47,397 --> 00:24:49,849
you stood by me when I left the Rivercourt

379
00:24:51,219 --> 00:24:54,723
because a voice in my head told me that it’s what I had to do.

380
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:58,220
So I’m here for you, Hales.

381
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:00,519
And I always will be.

382
00:25:02,312 --> 00:25:05,152
Even... when I don’t understand it.

383
00:25:06,362 --> 00:25:07,262
Thanks, Luke.

384
00:25:09,459 --> 00:25:10,298
Thank you.

385
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:13,417
Because...

386
00:25:14,691 --> 00:25:16,765
sometimes I don’t understand it either.

387
00:25:17,988 --> 00:25:20,012
Um, oh my god, Haley James?

388
00:25:20,242 --> 00:25:22,920
We just saw you play last night, could we get an autograph.

389
00:25:23,381 --> 00:25:24,184
Um...

390
00:25:25,552 --> 00:25:26,545
yeah, sure.

391
00:25:26,601 --> 00:25:27,462
Oh, thanks.

392
00:25:28,941 --> 00:25:30,554
- What’s your name? 
- Jennifer.

393
00:25:40,004 --> 00:25:42,633
Lucas and Haley aren’t back yet!

394
00:25:42,966 --> 00:25:45,372
But you can come in to the Devil’s lair.

395
00:25:45,534 --> 00:25:46,852
Drop your things...

396
00:25:47,152 --> 00:25:49,120
have sex with Chris Keller!

397
00:25:49,569 --> 00:25:50,588
Whatever.

398
00:25:52,114 --> 00:25:56,462
Here’s the deal: Brooke Davis thinks Chris Keller can self-serve Chris Keller;

399
00:25:56,554 --> 00:25:58,126
in other words, you can go-

400
00:25:58,233 --> 00:25:59,549
Oh hey, Brooke.

401
00:26:00,547 --> 00:26:01,817
What’s going on?

402
00:26:01,955 --> 00:26:03,600
She was just hitting on me.

403
00:26:05,125 --> 00:26:06,794
Hey, we missed you at the on-air.

404
00:26:07,137 --> 00:26:08,719
How’s the flu bug?

405
00:26:08,796 --> 00:26:11,726
Oh... it’ll pass, thanks. How’d it go?

406
00:26:11,826 --> 00:26:14,166
Well, without you, there’s more time to talk about me.

407
00:26:14,361 --> 00:26:15,463
It went great!

408
00:26:18,959 --> 00:26:19,681
What?

409
00:26:19,947 --> 00:26:24,540
I can’t breathe... there’s no room with Chris’ ego! Can we go?!

410
00:26:24,622 --> 00:26:26,675
Yes, let’s go. You can show me what you got.

411
00:26:26,772 --> 00:26:28,437
Hey, you can show me what you got, too.

412
00:26:30,259 --> 00:26:31,897
Lucas, it was good seeing you, buddy.

413
00:26:37,606 --> 00:26:40,125
Wow, yo-you angry or you just hitting on me?

414
00:26:40,229 --> 00:26:42,281
You ever tried singing with you jaw wired shut?

415
00:26:42,378 --> 00:26:43,515
I guess you’re angry.

416
00:26:43,643 --> 00:26:44,948
Do you think this is a joke?

417
00:26:45,549 --> 00:26:46,689
Because it’s not!

418
00:26:47,007 --> 00:26:49,444
You’re messing with people’s lives; people I care about!

419
00:26:49,521 --> 00:26:50,483
Messing how?

420
00:26:51,128 --> 00:26:52,557
You mean having sex with Haley?

421
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:56,576
Coz I never did that.

422
00:26:57,288 --> 00:26:58,081
Okay?

423
00:26:58,420 --> 00:26:59,884
Is that what you needed to hear?

424
00:27:02,438 --> 00:27:03,867
How’s Nathan doing, anyway?

425
00:27:04,835 --> 00:27:05,833
Don’t go there.

426
00:27:06,366 --> 00:27:08,694
Oh, come on, man, you don’t think I think about the guy?

427
00:27:08,941 --> 00:27:10,728
I’m a song writer; I carry all that crap around.

428
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:12,366
Well, then you should know how he's doing!

429
00:27:13,058 --> 00:27:14,204
He's terrible!

430
00:27:14,343 --> 00:27:15,248
Well, he should be.

431
00:27:15,433 --> 00:27:17,513
Haley’s a great girl. It would suck to lose her.

432
00:27:17,613 --> 00:27:19,924
And you don't feel the slightest bit guilty about that?!

433
00:27:20,025 --> 00:27:21,394
No, and I’ll tell you why:

434
00:27:21,547 --> 00:27:23,585
this is a one in a million chance we’re taking here.

435
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:27,285
You gotta be selfish as hell; you’re either all in... or you’re out.

436
00:27:27,875 --> 00:27:29,456
You don’t think I’ve tried to talk to her about it?

437
00:27:29,529 --> 00:27:31,530
In the middle of the night on some random bus ride?

438
00:27:31,643 --> 00:27:34,557
Hell, man, I’ve talked to her a lot more than you have these past few months.

439
00:27:39,452 --> 00:27:42,124
Listen, Luke, I know she’s your friend, so...

440
00:27:42,216 --> 00:27:44,402
you can hate me for helping her chase her dream, but...

441
00:27:45,692 --> 00:27:48,191
I’m just trying to help her, now. You know?

442
00:27:48,964 --> 00:27:50,311
That same way you are.

443
00:27:51,104 --> 00:27:52,625
The rest, it’s up to her.

444
00:27:59,706 --> 00:28:02,041
Hey. Tell Brooke I said ‘hi’.

445
00:28:11,437 --> 00:28:12,731
You don’t lock your door at night.

446
00:28:14,227 --> 00:28:15,562
No one can hurt me.

447
00:28:15,788 --> 00:28:16,997
Nah, that’s where you’re mistaken.

448
00:28:19,203 --> 00:28:20,775
- Is that right? 
- That’s right.

449
00:28:21,252 --> 00:28:25,271
You see, I know about your little tax evasion scam...

450
00:28:25,357 --> 00:28:28,210
and more than that...I have proof of it.

451
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:32,639
You know, I don’t have any idea what you’re talking about.

452
00:28:32,757 --> 00:28:33,662
Really?

453
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:38,183
I see you’ve got a... new security system installed.

454
00:28:38,863 --> 00:28:39,812
Who installed it?

455
00:28:41,501 --> 00:28:43,523
Gotta diversify your portfolio, Dan.

456
00:28:44,127 --> 00:28:46,203
Security’s good business; I should know.

457
00:28:47,128 --> 00:28:49,823
I own the company that put your system in.

458
00:28:52,597 --> 00:28:53,724
I have your ledger.

459
00:28:54,618 --> 00:28:55,577
You’re bluffing.

460
00:28:56,094 --> 00:28:57,747
Well, we’ll see about that.

461
00:29:11,935 --> 00:29:15,616
You know, leave all this. I plan to redecorate when I buy this place, anyway.

462
00:29:45,006 --> 00:29:48,129
Oh yeah, sorry about today with the fans, earlier.

463
00:29:48,410 --> 00:29:51,288
- We were talking and, I just, I’m sorry- 
- It’s okay.

464
00:29:52,066 --> 00:29:55,977
It’s okay; actually, it was kinda cool to... see how far you’ve come.

465
00:29:56,570 --> 00:29:58,436
You know, I’m proud of you.

466
00:29:59,909 --> 00:30:00,743
But?

467
00:30:01,834 --> 00:30:03,375
It’s killing him, Haley.

468
00:30:05,199 --> 00:30:09,817
I guess I just don’t understand why it has to be one or the other: music or Nathan.

469
00:30:12,659 --> 00:30:15,689
I noticed you weren’t... wearing your wedding ring.

470
00:30:20,836 --> 00:30:22,700
It’s not because of the record label.

471
00:30:24,221 --> 00:30:26,385
And it’s not because I don’t love him.

472
00:30:28,274 --> 00:30:29,335
I just...

473
00:30:31,921 --> 00:30:33,845
I feel like I don’t deserve to.

474
00:30:37,179 --> 00:30:40,035
Things were so much simpler when it was just the two of us.

475
00:30:46,713 --> 00:30:47,920
But it’s not.

476
00:30:58,635 --> 00:30:59,786
- Hey. 
- Hey!

477
00:31:00,208 --> 00:31:01,345
How’d your essay go?

478
00:31:02,201 --> 00:31:03,700
I did the best I could.

479
00:31:48,507 --> 00:31:49,786
Nice try, Hargrove.

480
00:32:43,735 --> 00:32:47,399
Lucas... we’ve got to get out of town before I spot another sale.

481
00:32:48,544 --> 00:32:50,933
I’m gonna go find somebody to carry these.

482
00:32:57,001 --> 00:32:58,245
Here, um...

483
00:32:58,841 --> 00:32:59,996
it’s my English final.

484
00:33:01,190 --> 00:33:02,418
Pulled an all-nighter.

485
00:33:02,756 --> 00:33:05,772
Aren’t you... supposed to be trashing hotel rooms or something?

486
00:33:06,228 --> 00:33:10,882
You know, what kind of a rock star spends the entire night doing an English final?

487
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:13,442
Well... I am still Tutor Girl.

488
00:33:13,692 --> 00:33:14,508
Right?

489
00:33:15,174 --> 00:33:16,182
Besides, it was...

490
00:33:17,159 --> 00:33:18,967
it was a pretty easy topic for me.

491
00:33:20,784 --> 00:33:21,905
So...

492
00:33:23,795 --> 00:33:26,231
maybe this means you’re coming back soon?

493
00:33:28,198 --> 00:33:28,956
No.

494
00:33:31,270 --> 00:33:32,970
I’m not coming home, Lucas.

495
00:33:35,642 --> 00:33:37,168
This is my life, now.

496
00:33:39,646 --> 00:33:41,111
Oh, um...

497
00:33:48,509 --> 00:33:51,080
I need you to... give this to Nathan for me, please.

498
00:33:52,806 --> 00:33:53,992
Please, Luke.

499
00:34:07,894 --> 00:34:10,004
So I guess this is goodbye?

500
00:34:11,202 --> 00:34:12,435
Yeah, I guess so.

501
00:34:18,973 --> 00:34:23,264
I... will always be there for you, Haley.

502
00:34:24,775 --> 00:34:26,966
You’ll always be my best friend.

503
00:34:39,925 --> 00:34:40,728
Hey.

504
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:42,869
Come here.

505
00:34:44,011 --> 00:34:45,531
It’s all gonna be okay now.

506
00:34:45,654 --> 00:34:46,600
Peyton...

507
00:34:48,563 --> 00:34:51,071
- I have to go. 
- What? No, don’t.

508
00:34:51,624 --> 00:34:53,574
- Stay here. 
- Nikki found Jenny.

509
00:34:54,194 --> 00:34:55,105
What d’ya mean?

510
00:34:55,874 --> 00:34:57,508
She has her, Peyton.

511
00:34:57,686 --> 00:34:59,771
What? How?

512
00:34:59,966 --> 00:35:03,672
I don’t know how, okay? But I have to go, I have to find her.

513
00:35:03,765 --> 00:35:04,639
I’ll go with you!

514
00:35:04,782 --> 00:35:06,161
- No, you can’t. 
- But...

515
00:35:06,237 --> 00:35:07,040
Peyton.

516
00:35:08,613 --> 00:35:09,610
You can’t.

517
00:35:12,703 --> 00:35:13,999
Why not?

518
00:35:15,638 --> 00:35:21,349
I mean, what’s the point of school and grades and all of this if I’m not...

519
00:35:22,662 --> 00:35:26,098
God Jake, I can’t be without you, I love you!

520
00:35:30,088 --> 00:35:31,141
You’re meant for better.

521
00:35:31,208 --> 00:35:32,517
- I’m not! 
- You are.

522
00:35:33,194 --> 00:35:36,758
Hey, look, I don’t know, maybe I’ll find Jenny sooner than later. Maybe I’ll be back-

523
00:35:36,828 --> 00:35:38,979
You won't! You know you won’t!

524
00:35:40,702 --> 00:35:41,638
Come here.

525
00:35:44,575 --> 00:35:45,579
Listen to me.

526
00:35:47,130 --> 00:35:48,253
I need you...

527
00:35:49,793 --> 00:35:51,391
- to get past this. 
- No!

528
00:35:51,477 --> 00:35:54,237
I need you to forget about me and move on.

529
00:35:55,226 --> 00:35:56,009
Okay?

530
00:35:57,396 --> 00:35:59,449
You’re too amazing to carry this around.

531
00:35:59,870 --> 00:36:01,800
You’re too full of greatness and...

532
00:36:05,102 --> 00:36:06,705
I love you too much.

533
00:36:13,177 --> 00:36:14,109
But I have to go.

534
00:36:14,212 --> 00:36:15,019
No!

535
00:36:17,272 --> 00:36:19,146
You know, I can’t have Jenny be with Nikki.

536
00:36:34,222 --> 00:36:35,178
Jake!

537
00:36:41,548 --> 00:36:42,556
Thank you.

538
00:36:45,645 --> 00:36:47,865
You know, I coulda held you in my arms forever.

539
00:36:50,594 --> 00:36:52,714
It still wouldn’t have been long enough.

540
00:38:04,860 --> 00:38:06,637
You miss Haley, don’t you?

541
00:38:10,541 --> 00:38:11,794
You gonna be alright?

542
00:38:14,548 --> 00:38:16,851
Yeah, it’s just hard to let someone go, you know?

543
00:38:21,402 --> 00:38:23,297
It’s okay that you’re into Peyton.

544
00:38:25,723 --> 00:38:29,477
I’ve been avoiding it the whole trip, but I found the things in your closet;

545
00:38:29,774 --> 00:38:30,721
and its fine.

546
00:39:04,505 --> 00:39:06,613
I just wanted to say goodbye before I left.

547
00:39:06,931 --> 00:39:09,343
You’re leaving now? Tonight?

548
00:39:10,166 --> 00:39:11,401
I think it’s best.

549
00:39:12,373 --> 00:39:13,300
For mum...

550
00:39:14,744 --> 00:39:15,753
and for you.

551
00:39:22,516 --> 00:39:24,098
Andy...

552
00:39:29,817 --> 00:39:32,711
Oh, and... I need you to give this to Lucas.

553
00:39:33,637 --> 00:39:34,410
Of course.

554
00:39:46,908 --> 00:39:47,717
Andy.

555
00:39:51,362 --> 00:39:52,734
I love you, you know?

556
00:39:56,356 --> 00:39:57,481
I do.

557
00:39:58,116 --> 00:39:59,346
And I love you, Karen.

558
00:40:03,399 --> 00:40:06,056
But, somehow, it just... doesn’t seem to be enough.

559
00:40:25,408 --> 00:40:27,571
George Bernard Shaw once wrote:

560
00:40:28,131 --> 00:40:30,126
‘There are two tragedies in life:

561
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:32,784
one is to lose your heart’s desire...

562
00:40:33,711 --> 00:40:35,549
the other is to gain it’.

563
00:40:36,793 --> 00:40:39,604
Clearly, Shaw had his heart broken once or twice.

564
00:40:54,311 --> 00:40:55,327
Where you been?

565
00:40:56,337 --> 00:40:57,452
Went to see a friend.

566
00:40:57,796 --> 00:40:59,920
Yeah? Anyone I know?

567
00:41:03,975 --> 00:41:04,989
Not really.

568
00:41:07,390 --> 00:41:08,838
You know you’re bleeding?

569
00:41:09,441 --> 00:41:10,686
Yeah.

570
00:41:12,024 --> 00:41:13,478
It should probably hurt, but...

571
00:41:14,093 --> 00:41:16,469
it’s kinda weird; I don’t feel anything.

572
00:41:19,449 --> 00:41:21,589
As far as I’m concerned, Shaw was a punk.

573
00:41:22,075 --> 00:41:24,572
Coz you know what? Tragedies happen.

574
00:41:25,581 --> 00:41:28,818
What’re you gonna do, give up? Quit? No.

575
00:41:30,194 --> 00:41:35,049
I realise now that when your heart breaks, you gotta fight like hell to make sure you’re still alive.

576
00:41:36,339 --> 00:41:37,343
Coz you are,

577
00:41:37,736 --> 00:41:39,017
and that pain you feel...

578
00:41:39,647 --> 00:41:40,655
it’s life.

579
00:41:41,173 --> 00:41:42,678
The confusion and fear...

580
00:41:43,486 --> 00:41:46,625
that’s there to remind you that somewhere out there is something better.

581
00:41:47,730 --> 00:41:49,861
And that something is worth fighting for.

582
00:42:01,505 --> 00:42:05,007
This year, I got everything I wanted and everything I wished for...

583
00:42:05,631 --> 00:42:09,358
but, in a way, I lost even more.

584
00:42:09,614 --> 00:42:11,843
Haley, the new tour posters are here.

585
00:42:14,068 --> 00:42:14,857
What’s this?

586
00:42:15,138 --> 00:42:19,322
Um... nothing, you know, just... stupid kid stuff.

587
00:42:21,713 --> 00:42:22,522
What d’ya think?

588
00:42:22,712 --> 00:42:23,556
Wow!

589
00:42:30,145 --> 00:42:31,395
Shaw was right:

590
00:42:31,897 --> 00:42:34,553
as we strain to grasp the things we desire...

591
00:42:34,672 --> 00:42:37,150
the things we think will make our lives better...

592
00:42:37,442 --> 00:42:40,406
money, popularity, fame...

593
00:42:40,693 --> 00:42:42,719
we ignore what truly matters...

594
00:42:42,828 --> 00:42:49,064
the simple things: like friendship, family, love.

595
00:42:50,195 --> 00:42:52,612
The things we probably already had.

596
00:42:54,588 --> 00:42:58,163
So, Mr. Shaw thinks that getting your hearts desire is a tragedy?

597
00:42:59,437 --> 00:43:00,926
I say he’s wrong.

598
00:43:01,459 --> 00:43:05,045
I mean, clearly, Shaw never kissed Erica Marsh.

599
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:29,784
Yes, losing your heart’s desire is tragic.

600
00:43:31,376 --> 00:43:33,106
But gaining your heart’s desire...

601
00:43:34,460 --> 00:43:35,866
it’s all you can hope for.

602
00:43:38,995 --> 00:43:40,976
This year, I wished for love.

603
00:43:42,973 --> 00:43:47,202
To immerse myself in someone else and to wake a heart long afraid to feel.

604
00:43:51,995 --> 00:43:53,597
My wish was granted.

605
00:43:56,567 --> 00:44:00,064
And if having that is tragic... then give me tragedy.

606
00:44:06,368 --> 00:44:08,946
Because, I wouldn’t give it back for the world.

607
00:44:42,110 --> 00:44:42,956
Hey.

608
00:44:45,462 --> 00:44:46,315
Need some help?

609
00:44:46,618 --> 00:44:47,298
Nah.

610
00:44:47,713 --> 00:44:51,379
I figure if I leave all my stuff here, my parents are gonna have to let me come back for senior year.

611
00:44:53,673 --> 00:44:56,258
Look, are we ever… gonna talk about Peyton?

612
00:44:56,846 --> 00:44:58,127
And the stuff you found?

613
00:44:58,548 --> 00:45:02,647
It’s not a big deal. Actually, I was… kinda relieved.

614
00:45:04,435 --> 00:45:05,480
Relieved?

615
00:45:05,818 --> 00:45:07,293
I thought you might be into me.

616
00:45:07,738 --> 00:45:12,653
And… that would’ve ruined everything because we’ve become friends…

617
00:45:12,735 --> 00:45:14,374
and that’s exactly what I needed.

618
00:45:14,737 --> 00:45:16,918
And… it’s exactly what I want.

619
00:45:18,253 --> 00:45:22,616
But you seemed… upset… that I held onto all that stuff; you still do.

620
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:26,324
Finding that stuff was kind of like…

621
00:45:27,611 --> 00:45:28,628
evidence.

622
00:45:29,535 --> 00:45:32,699
Reminded me of what happened… and how it happened.

623
00:45:34,490 --> 00:45:36,727
And I guess my heart just wasn’t ready for that.

624
00:45:49,765 --> 00:45:51,428
How you feeling, Ms. Scott?

625
00:45:52,079 --> 00:45:54,495
Coach! How you doing?

626
00:45:55,555 --> 00:45:57,609
Well, I guess you’re waiting for Danny.

627
00:45:57,774 --> 00:46:00,322
Uh, yeah, yeah, he… planned to pick me up.

628
00:46:00,747 --> 00:46:02,763
I was… hoping he’d bring Nathan.

629
00:46:03,958 --> 00:46:05,238
I lied.

630
00:46:05,753 --> 00:46:08,836
I had one of the girls at the office put you back an hour.

631
00:46:09,302 --> 00:46:12,154
I thought you and I might… have a talk.

632
00:46:17,842 --> 00:46:19,635
Any chance you could tap that thing?

633
00:46:20,228 --> 00:46:21,754
Sorry, we’re closed.

634
00:46:22,533 --> 00:46:25,640
Well, I hope so because if this is open, you’ve got problems.

635
00:46:26,168 --> 00:46:27,381
Where’re you taking this?

636
00:46:27,914 --> 00:46:29,895
- Over there, but… 
- I got it.

637
00:46:30,386 --> 00:46:31,876
Uh… thanks.

638
00:46:31,953 --> 00:46:33,059
No problem.

639
00:46:33,607 --> 00:46:35,707
If I had a dollar for every keg I’ve carried,

640
00:46:36,249 --> 00:46:37,729
I’d be a rich girl.

641
00:46:38,493 --> 00:46:39,686
Bartender?

642
00:46:40,028 --> 00:46:42,701
Only when I’m not killing people or saving the world.

643
00:46:43,294 --> 00:46:46,648
Well, if you’re looking for a job, I can put in a good word with the owner.

644
00:46:46,760 --> 00:46:48,865
Actually, I’m looking for Peyton.

645
00:46:49,468 --> 00:46:50,611
Oh, um…

646
00:46:50,882 --> 00:46:52,044
I’m Peyton.

647
00:46:53,360 --> 00:46:56,176
Oh. I’m Ellie.

648
00:46:56,376 --> 00:46:58,966
I write a column for Alternative Press. You know it?

649
00:46:59,771 --> 00:47:01,844
Know it? I read it cover to cover.

650
00:47:02,049 --> 00:47:03,087
Which column?

651
00:47:03,447 --> 00:47:04,958
Actually, it’s a new one.

652
00:47:05,141 --> 00:47:09,651
But I heard some high school girl got The Wreckers and Jimmy Eat World to play her club night.

653
00:47:09,918 --> 00:47:12,170
And I wanted to know more. Whaddaya say?

654
00:47:12,607 --> 00:47:16,835
I’d say I’m really flattered, but… I think last night was my final show.

655
00:47:17,967 --> 00:47:20,225
Well, I assume there’s a reason for that?

656
00:47:21,572 --> 00:47:22,391
Yeah.

657
00:47:22,749 --> 00:47:24,941
Sounds like the makings of a great story.

658
00:47:25,729 --> 00:47:26,974
No thanks.

659
00:47:27,204 --> 00:47:28,990
But it was really nice to meet you.

660
00:47:30,005 --> 00:47:32,175
It’s nice to meet you too, Peyton.

661
00:47:48,453 --> 00:47:51,990
Luke, find the combination and Dan is… finished.

662
00:48:38,578 --> 00:48:39,326
Hey.

663
00:48:40,840 --> 00:48:41,722
What’s up?

664
00:48:42,463 --> 00:48:43,419
Nothing, you?

665
00:48:44,875 --> 00:48:46,681
I thought you said you were done spying on him.

666
00:48:47,685 --> 00:48:48,812
I am.

667
00:48:49,635 --> 00:48:50,716
Then what’s in the bag?

668
00:48:56,027 --> 00:48:58,469
Just… bringing this back to you.

669
00:48:59,543 --> 00:49:01,028
You gave me your word, Luke.

670
00:49:01,791 --> 00:49:04,212
I know, and I’m done.

671
00:49:05,878 --> 00:49:06,815
I promise.

672
00:49:26,067 --> 00:49:27,535
Giving up on your dreams?

673
00:49:28,734 --> 00:49:29,506
Mom.

674
00:49:29,654 --> 00:49:31,022
Oh, my boy.

675
00:49:32,307 --> 00:49:34,344
I have missed you.

676
00:49:35,845 --> 00:49:37,449
It’s gonna be okay now, mom.

677
00:49:37,708 --> 00:49:38,539
Yeah.

678
00:49:39,966 --> 00:49:41,933
So, what’s all this about?

679
00:49:43,023 --> 00:49:44,651
Nathan’s moving home, Deb.

680
00:49:48,831 --> 00:49:50,334
We’re gonna be a family again.

681
00:49:53,687 --> 00:49:54,845
Welcome home.

682
00:50:28,413 --> 00:50:30,302
- Hi-O! 
- Oh God!

683
00:50:31,588 --> 00:50:32,442
What?

684
00:50:33,383 --> 00:50:34,832
You scared the hell outta me.

685
00:50:35,810 --> 00:50:38,713
You don’t know anybody who has IM named ‘WATCHMEWATCHU’, do you?

686
00:50:38,827 --> 00:50:42,354
Hmm... sounds pervy. Sadly no, why?

687
00:50:43,133 --> 00:50:45,487
Doesn’t matter. Sup?

688
00:50:45,581 --> 00:50:47,381
It’s actually what I came to ask you.

689
00:50:47,531 --> 00:50:51,754
Couldn’t find you at the club last night; figured maybe you stayed in with Jake.

690
00:50:51,827 --> 00:50:53,527
Jake’s gone, Brooke.

691
00:50:55,447 --> 00:50:56,862
Nikki has Jenny.

692
00:50:57,736 --> 00:51:00,361
Oh, Peyton, come here. What happened?

693
00:51:02,707 --> 00:51:07,458
I can’t, coz if you hug me, then I’m gonna start… bawling again, so…

694
00:51:09,051 --> 00:51:10,877
some summer break, huh?

695
00:51:12,993 --> 00:51:15,389
Well… I mean, he’s coming back, right?

696
00:51:15,486 --> 00:51:18,958
He’ll… find Jenny and then he can slap Nikki

697
00:51:19,034 --> 00:51:22,270
and then he’s coming right back to you! I just know it.

698
00:51:22,649 --> 00:51:23,586
Thanks.

699
00:51:25,183 --> 00:51:28,103
Okay, I’m sorry, I’m changing the subject;

700
00:51:28,178 --> 00:51:31,424
how was your road trip with Lucas.

701
00:51:31,528 --> 00:51:34,283
Um… fine.

702
00:51:34,419 --> 00:51:37,266
Fine? Is this gonna get sexual?

703
00:51:38,598 --> 00:51:40,653
I don’t know, that’s kind of up to you.

704
00:51:40,841 --> 00:51:41,593
What?

705
00:51:42,577 --> 00:51:45,397
It can wait. You’re head is spinning.

706
00:51:46,498 --> 00:51:50,128
Brooke, considering you’re leaving, tomorrow, it can’t wait.

707
00:51:50,722 --> 00:51:51,644
Spill!

708
00:51:52,112 --> 00:51:53,016
Okay.

709
00:51:54,710 --> 00:51:58,310
Um… I was snooping through Lucas’ things; kind of on purpose,

710
00:51:58,356 --> 00:52:01,448
and found a bunch of your stuff that he saved and I think he’s still into you.

711
00:52:03,803 --> 00:52:08,668
Like I said: bad timing… seeing that Jake just left, or maybe good timing?

712
00:52:10,097 --> 00:52:13,163
Brooke, I’m sorry.

713
00:52:13,491 --> 00:52:15,652
I know you have feelings for Lucas.

714
00:52:16,348 --> 00:52:17,869
Phantom feelings.

715
00:52:17,992 --> 00:52:20,986
Like… when you lose a leg and try to scratch it.

716
00:52:21,437 --> 00:52:25,657
Lucas was my… gangrene infected, amputated limb.

717
00:52:25,979 --> 00:52:26,870
Really?

718
00:52:28,585 --> 00:52:31,410
I was so insecure when I was with him, Peyton…

719
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:35,630
and this whole thing just reminded me that I don’t wanna be that girl again.

720
00:52:36,373 --> 00:52:37,401
I won’t be.

721
00:52:40,550 --> 00:52:43,444
Marcus, I don’t understand, he was supposed to be there by now.

722
00:52:44,426 --> 00:52:47,672
Well… can you leave him another message in case he checks in?

723
00:52:48,010 --> 00:52:49,173
Andy Hargrove.

724
00:52:49,776 --> 00:52:50,616
Thanks.

725
00:53:08,711 --> 00:53:09,586
Karen?

726
00:53:10,369 --> 00:53:11,870
Oh my gosh, Deb!

727
00:53:13,147 --> 00:53:14,214
Welcome back!

728
00:53:15,070 --> 00:53:17,107
You look like you just saw a ghost.

729
00:53:17,506 --> 00:53:18,894
Well, I think I did.

730
00:53:19,508 --> 00:53:20,604
How you feeling?

731
00:53:20,691 --> 00:53:25,253
Uh, good. Great actually. I just… I need to keep busy.

732
00:53:25,357 --> 00:53:28,351
Are you sure? I mean… you don’t wanna take some time?

733
00:53:28,433 --> 00:53:30,066
Uh, no, no, absolutely not.

734
00:53:30,143 --> 00:53:32,206
Well, okay. Let’s talk.

735
00:53:32,278 --> 00:53:33,133
Okay.

736
00:53:40,833 --> 00:53:42,703
You’re not going away, are you?

737
00:53:44,166 --> 00:53:45,334
Not this time.

738
00:53:46,650 --> 00:53:48,017
That’s a rad jacket.

739
00:53:48,385 --> 00:53:49,291
Thanks.

740
00:53:49,799 --> 00:53:51,555
I stole it from Courtney Love.

741
00:53:51,847 --> 00:53:52,553
Really?

742
00:53:52,640 --> 00:53:55,037
Yeah. She was being a bitch.

743
00:53:55,149 --> 00:53:56,173
So I took it.

744
00:53:57,484 --> 00:53:58,400
Have a seat.

745
00:53:59,559 --> 00:54:05,370
So, the editors at THUD are thrilled about your story and they say I have to talk to you.

746
00:54:06,172 --> 00:54:07,554
Is it that bad?

747
00:54:07,781 --> 00:54:11,257
Well, if there’s no House of Freaks at TRIC, there’s no story.

748
00:54:12,471 --> 00:54:15,487
And what about the rest of your life? Is it that bad?

749
00:54:17,201 --> 00:54:18,650
What do you know about it?

750
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:25,573
Well… your eyes are puffy which, from experience, screams textbook crying eyes.

751
00:54:25,665 --> 00:54:30,181
You have your hair up so you’re probably not planning on impressing any boys today.

752
00:54:30,246 --> 00:54:35,209
I’d say you’re nursing a hell of a broken heart; and not the school-girl crush kind, the real thing.

753
00:54:38,015 --> 00:54:40,350
Um… okay.

754
00:54:40,433 --> 00:54:44,762
Uh… well, I mean, I started TRIC to escape it all, you know, and…

755
00:54:44,854 --> 00:54:48,255
bring people together; let the music drown out the white noise in life.

756
00:54:48,341 --> 00:54:49,940
And tell me about your life.

757
00:54:50,133 --> 00:54:51,961
What is the white noise made of?

758
00:54:52,049 --> 00:54:55,187
Oh, god, I mean… everything unnecessary…

759
00:54:55,269 --> 00:55:00,620
like… cliques and… greed and popularity and harassment-

760
00:55:00,707 --> 00:55:02,330
The song remains the same.

761
00:55:02,412 --> 00:55:04,138
Yeah, as far as I can tell, it does.

762
00:55:10,057 --> 00:55:11,787
Looks like we’re both getting better.

763
00:55:12,790 --> 00:55:14,516
You love this game, don’t you?

764
00:55:15,500 --> 00:55:17,107
Depends on what day you ask me.

765
00:55:17,521 --> 00:55:20,332
Nah, you loved it every day since you could hold a ball.

766
00:55:21,551 --> 00:55:23,962
So… why aren’t you going to the camp?

767
00:55:24,925 --> 00:55:26,143
You talk to dad?

768
00:55:26,585 --> 00:55:27,710
Talked to Whitey.

769
00:55:28,269 --> 00:55:30,674
He said you’re staying because of me.

770
00:55:31,095 --> 00:55:32,892
Whitey also drinks a lot, mom.

771
00:55:34,638 --> 00:55:35,652
Then you’ll go.

772
00:55:38,083 --> 00:55:39,169
Look, uh…

773
00:55:40,879 --> 00:55:42,588
dad told me about the pills;

774
00:55:42,922 --> 00:55:44,863
about how you started taking them because…

775
00:55:44,939 --> 00:55:46,131
Because what?

776
00:55:46,931 --> 00:55:48,118
Because I moved out.

777
00:55:48,206 --> 00:55:49,885
Is that what he told you?

778
00:55:50,567 --> 00:55:53,233
I took the pills because you moved away?

779
00:55:53,772 --> 00:55:54,666
Yeah.

780
00:55:56,163 --> 00:55:57,704
That son of a bitch!

781
00:55:58,452 --> 00:55:59,915
Nathan, listen to me;

782
00:56:00,370 --> 00:56:03,869
you misunderstood me when I said that I wanted us to be a family again.

783
00:56:03,955 --> 00:56:08,768
I want us to be a family again; you and me.

784
00:56:09,972 --> 00:56:11,451
Will you come with me?

785
00:56:12,792 --> 00:56:13,714
Yeah.

786
00:56:15,342 --> 00:56:17,263
But what’re we gonna do about dad?

787
00:56:17,744 --> 00:56:19,500
Huh, he won’t just let us go.

788
00:56:19,612 --> 00:56:22,146
We’re getting out, Nathan, together.

789
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:25,342
Your father can burn in hell for all I care.

790
00:56:50,621 --> 00:56:52,488
Where is the combination?

791
00:57:21,028 --> 00:57:21,779
Damn!

792
00:57:52,602 --> 00:57:53,883
Game over.

793
00:58:02,510 --> 00:58:03,287
Brooke?

794
00:58:03,539 --> 00:58:09,094
Um… I found it while I was packing. Just… kind of felt like I should try it on.

795
00:58:11,003 --> 00:58:11,916
Can we talk?

796
00:58:12,412 --> 00:58:13,236
Yeah.

797
00:58:23,594 --> 00:58:27,290
I can’t let you leave tomorrow without saying this.

798
00:58:28,622 --> 00:58:31,428
Lucas, if this is about Peyton, I don’t-

799
00:58:31,596 --> 00:58:34,306
I love you, Brooke.

800
00:58:35,181 --> 00:58:37,726
And, I know: just friends, but…

801
00:58:38,565 --> 00:58:41,053
I need you to know how I feel.

802
00:58:45,374 --> 00:58:47,079
I can’t believe I’m hearing this.

803
00:58:47,490 --> 00:58:48,826
Brooke, don’t go.

804
00:58:49,072 --> 00:58:53,153
I can’t believe… you would walk into my bedroom -

805
00:58:53,507 --> 00:58:56,113
formally your bedroom; but that’s besides the point -

806
00:58:56,409 --> 00:59:01,047
and knowing our history… blurt out that you love me.

807
00:59:05,143 --> 00:59:06,737
Coz I was hoping you would.

808
00:59:16,202 --> 00:59:16,971
Brooke?

809
00:59:17,933 --> 00:59:19,449
It took you long enough.

810
00:59:40,497 --> 00:59:42,201
This has gotta be a dream.

811
01:00:00,399 --> 01:00:02,528
Lucas! Do not make me join you!

812
01:00:02,663 --> 01:00:04,423
Uh… a little privacy here.

813
01:00:04,525 --> 01:00:08,535
No, you have been in the shower forever. By the time I even get in, the water is gonna be...

814
01:00:08,790 --> 01:00:11,800
...cold! Are you taking a cold shower!?

815
01:00:11,882 --> 01:00:14,857
- No, the hot water just- 
- Gross! You are.

816
01:00:14,934 --> 01:00:17,776
You know what, next wet dream, tell Peyton I said ‘hi’.

817
01:00:17,899 --> 01:00:18,699
Eww!

818
01:00:22,916 --> 01:00:25,446
Mom, can we get a lock on the bathroom door?

819
01:00:26,700 --> 01:00:27,740
Going somewhere?

820
01:00:29,261 --> 01:00:30,550
Like New Zealand?

821
01:00:32,004 --> 01:00:33,577
You know, Keith was right.

822
01:00:35,534 --> 01:00:39,701
He once told me that I… I hide my heart and I run from love.

823
01:00:41,190 --> 01:00:42,654
I did that with Andy.

824
01:00:44,616 --> 01:00:48,849
I’m just being dumb; we don’t even have money for two plane tickets to New Zealand, right?

825
01:00:51,046 --> 01:00:52,503
We have enough for one.

826
01:00:54,318 --> 01:00:56,959
Look… mom, I love you…

827
01:00:57,205 --> 01:01:00,993
but… I’m a big boy now and I’ll be fine on my own.

828
01:01:04,327 --> 01:01:05,818
It’s your journey to take.

829
01:01:13,564 --> 01:01:16,856
If I thought he was coming back soon, I wouldn’t even consider it.

830
01:01:16,999 --> 01:01:18,597
- I know. 
- But you’re…

831
01:01:20,855 --> 01:01:24,879
Dan… is pulling the strings as usual.

832
01:01:29,334 --> 01:01:30,523
Not for long.

833
01:01:38,456 --> 01:01:39,528
Let me ask you something:

834
01:01:39,605 --> 01:01:42,302
are you not helping me move you because it brings back bad memories

835
01:01:42,353 --> 01:01:44,387
or because you’re a lazy pile of crap?

836
01:01:44,980 --> 01:01:47,515
You mean… bad memories like these?

837
01:01:51,170 --> 01:01:52,240
Oh god.

838
01:01:52,668 --> 01:01:54,191
We started off the school year this way.

839
01:01:54,274 --> 01:01:55,575
Yeah, don’t remind me.

840
01:01:55,922 --> 01:01:58,068
- You were never happier. 
- You were never hornier!

841
01:01:58,159 --> 01:01:59,645
Oh yeah? You want some more of that magic?

842
01:01:59,721 --> 01:02:00,407
- Don’t- 
- Come here.

843
01:02:00,474 --> 01:02:01,174
- No- 
- Come on.

844
01:02:01,246 --> 01:02:02,926
Okay, stop it! Ah!

845
01:02:04,332 --> 01:02:04,794
Come on.

846
01:02:04,892 --> 01:02:07,011
- Will you stop! 
- Well, well!

847
01:02:07,155 --> 01:02:09,726
First Lucas, then Jake, now Nathan.

848
01:02:09,843 --> 01:02:11,455
I guess slutty’s in season!

849
01:02:11,804 --> 01:02:13,770
And why is bitch being a Brooke?

850
01:02:13,863 --> 01:02:16,520
I don’t know, maybe because I’m leaving for the summer;

851
01:02:16,591 --> 01:02:20,684
possibly forever and my best friend is off… giving interviews and

852
01:02:20,765 --> 01:02:25,290
having… pseudo-innocent foreplay with kinda married guys.

853
01:02:26,572 --> 01:02:27,477
Okay.

854
01:02:29,868 --> 01:02:31,461
Hi, Alternative Press?

855
01:02:31,578 --> 01:02:32,760
Editorial please.

856
01:02:33,211 --> 01:02:34,384
What’re you doing?

857
01:02:34,742 --> 01:02:37,989
I know that you are needy right now and so I’m postponing the interview

858
01:02:38,050 --> 01:02:40,365
until after my best friend is gone for the summer.

859
01:02:42,367 --> 01:02:44,235
Hi, Ellie Harp, please.

860
01:02:45,141 --> 01:02:47,850
Oh, okay, um… maybe I have the name wrong.

861
01:02:47,952 --> 01:02:51,056
She’s doing an article on Peyton Sawyer and the nightclub TRIC.

862
01:02:51,501 --> 01:02:53,832
Oh, are you sure?

863
01:02:55,290 --> 01:02:56,703
Okay, thanks.

864
01:02:57,741 --> 01:02:58,613
You okay?

865
01:02:58,685 --> 01:03:01,399
The woman said that she knows all the columnists at the magazine

866
01:03:01,454 --> 01:03:04,219
and she’s never heard of Ellie Harp or the story.

867
01:03:04,705 --> 01:03:07,388
So… maybe you have the wrong magazine?

868
01:03:08,070 --> 01:03:09,328
Yeah, maybe.

869
01:03:13,272 --> 01:03:15,028
Every transaction is listed.

870
01:03:15,248 --> 01:03:18,503
The actual sale price and the price Dan declared to the government.

871
01:03:18,612 --> 01:03:21,269
He’s done it a thousand times Deb; it’s a federal offence.

872
01:03:21,802 --> 01:03:22,739
Prison?

873
01:03:25,115 --> 01:03:28,503
So… why are you bringing this to me? He’s my husband.

874
01:03:29,247 --> 01:03:31,121
And he’s my father.

875
01:03:31,673 --> 01:03:35,201
But… I figured you could use it to get away from him.

876
01:03:35,472 --> 01:03:36,569
To get out.

877
01:03:37,602 --> 01:03:39,200
You’d do that for me?

878
01:03:39,646 --> 01:03:43,072
Yeah, and for Nathan… and Keith…

879
01:03:43,291 --> 01:03:45,133
and everybody else he’s hurt.

880
01:03:46,429 --> 01:03:49,092
So… this is it.

881
01:03:49,650 --> 01:03:53,388
This is the smoking gun that can bring down Dan Scott.

882
01:03:53,884 --> 01:03:54,908
Yep.

883
01:04:13,612 --> 01:04:15,301
Looking for something?

884
01:04:25,087 --> 01:04:26,053
Where is it?

885
01:04:26,572 --> 01:04:27,220
Where’s what?

886
01:04:27,291 --> 01:04:29,105
Don’t play dumb with me! Where’s the ledger?!

887
01:04:29,397 --> 01:04:34,215
Oh, you mean the ledger that exposes my husband’s illegal activities over several years?

888
01:04:34,313 --> 01:04:35,977
Tell me that ledger doesn’t exist, Dan.

889
01:04:36,062 --> 01:04:37,385
You don’t see the big picture, Deb.

890
01:04:37,471 --> 01:04:39,038
Oh, I think I do.

891
01:04:39,146 --> 01:04:40,671
Just give me the damn book!

892
01:04:40,958 --> 01:04:44,604
You told Nathan that my addiction was his fault.

893
01:04:44,885 --> 01:04:46,251
What’re you talking about?

894
01:04:46,328 --> 01:04:48,869
You knew I wouldn’t come back unless Nathan was living here.

895
01:04:48,976 --> 01:04:50,879
Take another pill, Deb? You’re delusional.

896
01:04:50,973 --> 01:04:53,420
No, I was delusional:

897
01:04:53,502 --> 01:04:55,812
loving you, thinking you’d change.

898
01:04:56,144 --> 01:05:02,939
But I’ve got clarity now, Danny-boy, and I finally see you for the pathetic, broken man you are.

899
01:05:04,055 --> 01:05:05,329
Lemonade?

900
01:05:05,928 --> 01:05:09,358
You know, a guy like me works his entire life trying to build something.

901
01:05:10,143 --> 01:05:14,345
Trying to make his mark in the world; to provide for his family,

902
01:05:15,097 --> 01:05:19,323
working hour after hour to turn the seed of an idea into a successful business.

903
01:05:19,383 --> 01:05:20,710
A fraudulent business.

904
01:05:20,801 --> 01:05:24,013
A fraudulent business owned by my wife.

905
01:05:25,897 --> 01:05:28,949
You know, it’s a shame that ignorance isn’t an excuse, Deb,

906
01:05:29,416 --> 01:05:32,880
because when you turn in that ledger, both of Nathan’s parents will be felons.

907
01:05:33,398 --> 01:05:35,869
Hell, you’ll just go from one institution to the next.

908
01:05:35,968 --> 01:05:38,933
Today: the drunk tank, tomorrow: prison.

909
01:05:39,649 --> 01:05:40,944
You bastard.

910
01:05:41,169 --> 01:05:45,276
No, Deb, the bastard would’ve been Nathan; that is, if I wouldn’t have married you.

911
01:05:45,352 --> 01:05:47,180
And made us all so happy.

912
01:05:49,725 --> 01:05:51,478
Where’s the ledger, Deb?


913
01:06:09,705 --> 01:06:10,978
Hello?

914
01:06:11,085 --> 01:06:12,924
You can run but you can’t hide.

915
01:06:12,995 --> 01:06:13,927
Who is this?

916
01:06:14,015 --> 01:06:14,676
It’s Ellie.

917
01:06:14,751 --> 01:06:16,058
Where’d you get this number?

918
01:06:16,200 --> 01:06:17,260
Well, I-

919
01:06:17,327 --> 01:06:19,068
Leave me alone and don’t call me!

920
01:06:25,583 --> 01:06:26,379
Mom?

921
01:06:28,489 --> 01:06:29,333
Nate.

922
01:06:29,748 --> 01:06:31,760
What’s going on? You sounded freaked out on the phone.

923
01:06:32,155 --> 01:06:34,222
We’re gonna have to stay here for a while.

924
01:06:34,746 --> 01:06:35,555
What happened?

925
01:06:35,642 --> 01:06:39,062
Nathan, I’m so sorry. It’s just… your father has done some things.

926
01:06:39,342 --> 01:06:41,668
- What things? 
- Nothing that concerns you.

927
01:06:42,308 --> 01:06:44,182
But Lucas found something.

928
01:06:44,796 --> 01:06:45,528
Lucas.

929
01:06:45,615 --> 01:06:47,201
He was trying to help us.

930
01:06:47,300 --> 01:06:51,263
But it-it doesn’t matter now. What does matter is that you remember I love you…

931
01:06:51,555 --> 01:06:53,264
and I always will.

932
01:06:53,987 --> 01:06:55,148
We were gonna get out.

933
01:06:55,609 --> 01:06:58,845
And we still are, okay? I promise you.

934
01:06:58,933 --> 01:07:01,892
But… for now, that has to be our secret.

935
01:07:02,859 --> 01:07:05,364
I want you to go to High Flyers.

936
01:07:05,461 --> 01:07:08,267
Forget it! I’m not leaving you here alone with Dan!

937
01:07:08,343 --> 01:07:09,890
Nathan, I’ll be fine!

938
01:07:10,099 --> 01:07:14,196
You go to that camp and don’t look back for a second, do you understand me?

939
01:07:15,870 --> 01:07:17,257
It has to end.

940
01:07:17,887 --> 01:07:20,549
Yes… it does.

941
01:07:37,213 --> 01:07:38,822
Ah, here we go again.

942
01:07:38,909 --> 01:07:40,952
Oh, don’t mind me; I just need your measurements.

943
01:07:41,039 --> 01:07:44,383
Alright, I’ll play along; my measurements for what?

944
01:07:44,470 --> 01:07:46,688
For the pine box they’re gonna put you in.

945
01:07:47,664 --> 01:07:49,523
I’m about to bury you, Whitey.

946
01:07:50,296 --> 01:07:54,684
You crossed the line, Whitey; talking to Deb, meddling with Nathan.

947
01:07:55,089 --> 01:07:59,180
You know, I occupy a seat on the school board; I think we’re gonna make some changes next season.

948
01:07:59,256 --> 01:08:00,798
Don’t you threaten me!

949
01:08:00,890 --> 01:08:02,462
Oh, it’s not a threat!

950
01:08:02,554 --> 01:08:04,362
You’ve got some health concerns, don’t you?

951
01:08:04,684 --> 01:08:07,572
Bad eyes and all; that coupled with the first round playoff loss.

952
01:08:07,643 --> 01:08:08,544
Which you coached!

953
01:08:08,625 --> 01:08:09,983
Because you were ill!

954
01:08:11,038 --> 01:08:13,746
You know, it’s a shame you never won the state title, Whitey,

955
01:08:14,048 --> 01:08:16,081
because as far as I’m concerned…

956
01:08:16,291 --> 01:08:18,001
you’re never gonna coach again!

957
01:08:18,099 --> 01:08:20,151
You better be careful, son.

958
01:08:20,387 --> 01:08:23,597
You mess with my livelihood, I’ll mess with yours.

959
01:08:23,726 --> 01:08:25,594
Speaking of threats.

960
01:08:26,014 --> 01:08:27,852
You know, most people…

961
01:08:27,970 --> 01:08:32,921
when they go they leave the world a lesser place, but not you.

962
01:08:33,228 --> 01:08:36,715
No, the world won’t even blink.

963
01:08:36,802 --> 01:08:39,162
Well, you’d know, wouldn’t you, Whitey?

964
01:08:40,512 --> 01:08:43,197
You’re playing with fire, Danny…

965
01:08:43,417 --> 01:08:46,165
and you are about to get burned!

966
01:08:46,253 --> 01:08:48,199
Bring it on, old man.

967
01:08:57,805 --> 01:09:00,450
Okay, I’ve spoken with Deb so she’s gonna look after things.

968
01:09:00,549 --> 01:09:02,264
And all my numbers are near the phone.

969
01:09:02,371 --> 01:09:04,122
- Oh, and if Keith calls- 
- Mom…

970
01:09:05,499 --> 01:09:06,627
go.

971
01:09:08,004 --> 01:09:09,498
If you need anything…

972
01:09:10,215 --> 01:09:12,924
well I’ll only be… half a world away.

973
01:09:17,327 --> 01:09:19,037
Go find happiness, mom.

974
01:09:19,780 --> 01:09:20,753
I love you.

975
01:09:24,109 --> 01:09:25,232
I love you, too.

976
01:10:51,848 --> 01:10:53,583
Oh, he still hasn’t checked in?

977
01:10:54,366 --> 01:10:56,339
Oh-no, no message, thank you.

978
01:11:30,155 --> 01:11:31,524
- What’s going on? 
- Where is it?

979
01:11:32,721 --> 01:11:33,694
Where’s what?

980
01:11:33,779 --> 01:11:35,773
Whatever it is you have on my dad, where is it?

981
01:11:35,916 --> 01:11:36,891
Nathan, look.

982
01:11:37,001 --> 01:11:38,793
Lucas, you said you were done!

983
01:11:42,377 --> 01:11:44,226
Nate, you don’t wanna do that!

984
01:11:49,945 --> 01:11:52,346
I wanted to tell you… Nate.

985
01:11:53,105 --> 01:11:55,480
I was just… waiting for the right time.

986
01:11:55,971 --> 01:11:57,159
You went to see her.

987
01:11:58,758 --> 01:12:00,379
You’re just full of lies, aren’t you?

988
01:12:00,472 --> 01:12:01,148
Nathan!

989
01:12:01,234 --> 01:12:03,533
You don’t wanna push this right now, Lucas! Trust me!

990
01:12:07,695 --> 01:12:09,811
So the prodigal son returns.

991
01:12:12,110 --> 01:12:13,451
You looking for this?

992
01:12:15,407 --> 01:12:16,558
Or, maybe,

993
01:12:18,519 --> 01:12:19,595
you’re looking for this.

994
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:24,690
Go on, take a closer look.

995
01:12:35,231 --> 01:12:36,809
How stupid do you think I’d be?

996
01:12:38,016 --> 01:12:39,671
Who keeps money in the ceiling?

997
01:12:39,897 --> 01:12:42,313
Or a ledger of their criminal activities?

998
01:12:42,906 --> 01:12:45,467
Uses jersey numbers as a combination.

999
01:12:45,614 --> 01:12:48,630
Although you did figure that out so you’re not entirely dense.

1000
01:12:48,984 --> 01:12:49,849
Why?

1001
01:12:49,931 --> 01:12:52,782
Why? To test your loyalty, Lucas.

1002
01:12:53,571 --> 01:12:54,899
You know what the shame is?

1003
01:12:56,823 --> 01:12:58,753
I would have given you the world, son.

1004
01:13:00,141 --> 01:13:02,297
I would have welcomed you in with open arms.

1005
01:13:03,725 --> 01:13:05,321
But you failed the test.

1006
01:13:05,895 --> 01:13:07,846
And for that, you get nothing.

1007
01:13:08,097 --> 01:13:10,145
For that, you are nothing.

1008
01:13:14,180 --> 01:13:15,685
So it was all a lie?

1009
01:13:16,801 --> 01:13:20,053
The money in the ceiling, the bank account in my name.

1010
01:13:20,129 --> 01:13:21,880
No, the account was real.

1011
01:13:22,115 --> 01:13:25,295
I built that since you were a boy, but that’s gone now, too.

1012
01:13:25,526 --> 01:13:27,226
So’s your heart medication.

1013
01:13:28,931 --> 01:13:31,551
The game’s over, you lose.

1014
01:13:34,353 --> 01:13:35,151
No.

1015
01:13:37,236 --> 01:13:38,337
You’re wrong.

1016
01:13:40,861 --> 01:13:43,441
Because I can finally let you go.

1017
01:13:46,442 --> 01:13:48,944
I mean nothing to you?

1018
01:13:50,696 --> 01:13:52,647
You mean nothing to me.

1019
01:13:52,948 --> 01:13:54,059
I’m out.

1020
01:13:54,874 --> 01:13:56,485
That’s where you’re wrong.

1021
01:13:59,804 --> 01:14:01,366
You’ll never be out.

1022
01:14:02,145 --> 01:14:03,219
Son.

1023
01:14:04,505 --> 01:14:05,759
We’ll see about that.

1024
01:14:27,847 --> 01:14:33,526
Okay, that is the last bag, box or suitcase I shift this summer.

1025
01:14:33,616 --> 01:14:34,835
Your cab’s on the way.

1026
01:14:35,046 --> 01:14:36,848
- I don’t wanna go! 
- I know.

1027
01:14:36,956 --> 01:14:40,104
And I don’t want you to go but life sucks like that.

1028
01:14:40,365 --> 01:14:43,694
But, hey, you are going to be back in no time and then we will be seniors

1029
01:14:43,735 --> 01:14:45,384
and oh what fun we will have then!

1030
01:14:45,480 --> 01:14:46,345
Like what?

1031
01:14:46,463 --> 01:14:49,060
Hm, like… kidnapping…

1032
01:14:49,223 --> 01:14:51,706
and… getting married

1033
01:14:51,952 --> 01:14:56,084
and… burning letters from guys before we read them.

1034
01:14:57,191 --> 01:14:59,381
Speaking of, where is our boyfriend?

1035
01:14:59,714 --> 01:15:00,662
I don’t know.

1036
01:15:01,020 --> 01:15:03,441
I guess he’s not even coming to say goodbye to me.

1037
01:15:04,346 --> 01:15:06,743
Suppose it’s a test… for the new me.

1038
01:15:07,783 --> 01:15:09,222
I’m sure he will be here.

1039
01:15:10,386 --> 01:15:12,249
I, on the other hand, will not.

1040
01:15:12,402 --> 01:15:13,159
What!?

1041
01:15:13,303 --> 01:15:17,122
I promised Karen I wouldn’t sleep on TRIC and I’ve gotta return the keys to Deb.

1042
01:15:18,059 --> 01:15:19,047
I’m sorry.

1043
01:15:20,366 --> 01:15:23,011
I’m gonna miss you, Brooke Penelope Davis.

1044
01:15:23,115 --> 01:15:25,801
I’m gonna miss you, Peyton Elizabeth Sawyer.

1045
01:15:30,056 --> 01:15:31,105
Hoes over Bros?

1046
01:15:31,976 --> 01:15:33,460
Buds over Studs.

1047
01:15:39,906 --> 01:15:41,351
I thought you weren’t talking to me.

1048
01:15:41,463 --> 01:15:42,359
I’m not.

1049
01:15:44,055 --> 01:15:45,328
I’m going to High Flyers.

1050
01:15:46,854 --> 01:15:48,253
Nate, that’s great!

1051
01:15:48,867 --> 01:15:52,057
When I get back… all this brother stuff is over.

1052
01:15:53,313 --> 01:15:53,921
What?

1053
01:15:54,003 --> 01:15:56,415
You lied to me, Lucas; about my dad…

1054
01:15:56,931 --> 01:15:58,610
and about going to see Haley.

1055
01:15:59,338 --> 01:16:01,093
I’ve got enough of that in my life.

1056
01:16:01,207 --> 01:16:02,696
Nathan, I was trying to help.

1057
01:16:02,793 --> 01:16:04,492
Yeah, well you can stop that now.

1058
01:16:05,199 --> 01:16:08,651
All I need you to do for me is knock down shots next year, that’s it.

1059
01:16:09,567 --> 01:16:10,889
We’re not brothers.

1060
01:16:12,219 --> 01:16:13,586
We’re not even friends.

1061
01:16:25,336 --> 01:16:26,500
Well…

1062
01:16:28,752 --> 01:16:30,994
I’ll see ya, Brooke. Have a nice summer.

1063
01:16:31,088 --> 01:16:32,583
Oh, thanks, everybody.

1064
01:16:34,446 --> 01:16:35,767
Talking to yourself?

1065
01:16:37,543 --> 01:16:40,748
What, is your… summer job driving a cab?

1066
01:16:43,324 --> 01:16:44,875
I put your stuff in the car.

1067
01:16:46,601 --> 01:16:48,564
So I guess this is goodbye?

1068
01:17:11,116 --> 01:17:13,292
Tell me that was a goodbye kiss.

1069
01:17:14,249 --> 01:17:16,016
I wanna be with you, Brooke.

1070
01:17:18,996 --> 01:17:19,800
What?

1071
01:17:19,912 --> 01:17:21,044
I’m sorry.

1072
01:17:22,427 --> 01:17:23,870
I know we’re friends…

1073
01:17:24,065 --> 01:17:25,569
it’s just how I feel.

1074
01:17:26,673 --> 01:17:29,011
What about Peyton’s stuff?

1075
01:17:29,123 --> 01:17:33,111
I keep that stuff as a reminder of how badly I screwed up things.

1076
01:17:34,633 --> 01:17:35,513
With you.

1077
01:17:36,664 --> 01:17:40,807
To remind myself, if I ever get a second chance…

1078
01:17:41,236 --> 01:17:43,371
I’d never let you go again.

1079
01:17:46,726 --> 01:17:48,343
I don’t know what to say.

1080
01:17:49,163 --> 01:17:50,130
I, um…

1081
01:17:57,006 --> 01:17:58,312
I gotta go.

1082
01:18:00,725 --> 01:18:01,574
Brooke?

1083
01:18:03,299 --> 01:18:05,793
You think… you could ever-

1084
01:18:05,859 --> 01:18:07,037
Lucas…

1085
01:18:09,065 --> 01:18:10,135
I’m sorry.

1086
01:18:12,562 --> 01:18:15,516
I… I gotta go.

1087
01:18:22,842 --> 01:18:23,805
Bye.

1088
01:18:28,612 --> 01:18:30,262
Have a nice summer, Brooke.

1089
01:19:33,201 --> 01:19:34,281
Jake...

1090
01:19:44,271 --> 01:19:45,581
I know it’s late. I-

1091
01:19:45,653 --> 01:19:47,907
You’re right… it is late.

1092
01:19:48,019 --> 01:19:51,101
As a matter of fact, it’s half past the crazy bitch so leave me alone!

1093
01:19:51,178 --> 01:19:53,292
Peyton, I can explain.

1094
01:19:53,379 --> 01:19:55,925
Explain what!? That you’re a stalker…

1095
01:19:56,006 --> 01:19:58,689
or that you’re insane and you’ve been sending me creepy e-mails?!

1096
01:19:58,767 --> 01:19:59,969
I didn’t send you anything.

1097
01:20:00,054 --> 01:20:04,281
Yeah, right. I called your supposed magazine; they’ve never even heard of you.

1098
01:20:06,415 --> 01:20:08,330
My name is Elizabeth.

1099
01:20:09,287 --> 01:20:11,873
Great, so even your name is a lie.

1100
01:20:12,298 --> 01:20:15,898
Like your middle name: Elizabeth.

1101
01:20:17,131 --> 01:20:19,094
It’s where you got your middle name.

1102
01:20:22,687 --> 01:20:23,856
Who are you?

1103
01:20:25,360 --> 01:20:26,553
I’m your mother.

1104
01:21:54,684 --> 01:21:56,608
Oh, Nathan, I was hoping that was you.

1105
01:21:56,773 --> 01:21:58,457
I’ve been here, alone, all night!

1106
01:21:59,185 --> 01:22:00,910
I had… something to do.

1107
01:22:01,806 --> 01:22:02,857
Oh, honey.

1108
01:22:05,252 --> 01:22:10,266
I know this is hard for you but, I promise you, we’ll be free soon.

1109
01:22:10,909 --> 01:22:12,092
I know we will.

1110
01:22:16,065 --> 01:22:17,616
Do you need help with anything?

1111
01:22:17,714 --> 01:22:20,643
No, I just… I have one more bag in the car.

1112
01:22:22,455 --> 01:22:23,300
Okay.

1113
01:22:40,442 --> 01:22:41,349
Hi.

1114
01:23:08,438 --> 01:23:10,344
Looks like it’s just you and me this summer.

1115
01:23:23,549 --> 01:23:25,621
Tennessee Williams once wrote:

1116
01:23:26,748 --> 01:23:28,960
‘We all live in a house of fire.

1117
01:23:29,825 --> 01:23:33,219
No fire department to call. No way out.

1118
01:23:33,900 --> 01:23:36,404
Just the upstairs window to look out of-

1119
01:23:38,073 --> 01:23:40,435
while the fire burns the house down…

1120
01:23:41,607 --> 01:23:44,868
with us trapped, locked in it.’
