1
00:00:00,011 --> 00:00:01,540
Previously on "One Tree Hill"...

2
00:00:01,541 --> 00:00:04,525
I have a heart condition, and if I play, I could die.

3
00:00:04,526 --> 00:00:06,855
You're lucky all I did was send him away.

4
00:00:06,856 --> 00:00:09,071
Daddy, that was Pete from Fall Out Boy.

5
00:00:09,072 --> 00:00:11,815
Marry me again in front of all our friends and our family.

6
00:00:11,816 --> 00:00:14,744
When are you gonna get over Jabba the slut so we can go back to being friends?

7
00:00:14,745 --> 00:00:16,211
What are you doing to Rachel, Brooke?

8
00:00:16,212 --> 00:00:18,949
The picture -- Rachel said it was someone she knew.

9
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:21,132
It's you. This used to be you.

10
00:00:21,137 --> 00:00:22,990
Just please be careful.

11
00:00:23,242 --> 00:00:26,266
What if we don't have sex until we get married again?

12
00:00:26,267 --> 00:00:27,396
Are you kidding?

13
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:29,782
Uncle Cooper, what are you doing here, man?

14
00:00:29,786 --> 00:00:32,772
I met this smoking-hot girl. She's 26. She's a model --

15
00:00:32,777 --> 00:00:34,433
you know, my type.

16
00:00:35,195 --> 00:00:36,242
Mouth.

17
00:00:36,248 --> 00:00:38,971
- I just thought maybe --
- Oh, you got flowers. Who are they from?

18
00:00:38,977 --> 00:00:40,460
Just promise me one thing --

19
00:00:40,465 --> 00:00:42,920
when you pick the boy that you're really gonna be with

20
00:00:42,928 --> 00:00:45,270
that he'll be someone who respects you.

21
00:00:45,278 --> 00:00:48,391
Use your head and follow your heart.

22
00:01:32,747 --> 00:01:34,163
Stepping up --

23
00:01:35,046 --> 00:01:36,501
it's a simple concept.

24
00:01:37,187 --> 00:01:39,812
It basically means to rise above yourself,

25
00:01:40,588 --> 00:01:42,403
to do a little more...

26
00:01:42,797 --> 00:01:44,913
to show you something special...

27
00:01:45,648 --> 00:01:46,993
something like this.

28
00:01:51,998 --> 00:01:55,172
Lucas is gone, but that doesn't mean the season is over.

29
00:01:56,418 --> 00:01:59,131
As a matter of fact, I'd say it's just beginning.

30
00:02:01,035 --> 00:02:03,153
You might want to stay out of my way for a while.

31
00:02:04,646 --> 00:02:08,893
Another ferocious dunk by Nathan Scott, and this crowd is on their feet.

32
00:02:09,276 --> 00:02:11,443
Sure you don't want to sleep with me till the ceremony?

33
00:02:11,448 --> 00:02:13,402
I know I look pretty sexy right now.

34
00:02:18,527 --> 00:02:21,482
Life's funny sometimes, can push pretty hard,

35
00:02:21,486 --> 00:02:24,640
like when you fall in love with someone, but they forget to love you back,

36
00:02:25,118 --> 00:02:28,192
like when your best friend and your boyfriend leave you alone,

37
00:02:29,026 --> 00:02:33,571
like when you pull the trigger or light the flame, and you can't take it back.

38
00:02:37,718 --> 00:02:40,842
Like I said, in sports, they call this "stepping up."

39
00:02:41,327 --> 00:02:45,222
In life, I call it pushing back.

40
00:02:50,616 --> 00:02:51,801
Hey.

41
00:02:53,067 --> 00:02:54,292
Hey.

42
00:02:55,787 --> 00:02:57,372
Jenny didn't wake you up, did she?

43
00:02:57,376 --> 00:03:00,713
No. I mean, not -- not really.

44
00:03:01,446 --> 00:03:03,120
So what happened to you last night?

45
00:03:03,128 --> 00:03:05,612
Jenny was a little fussy, so we slept on the couch.

46
00:03:06,998 --> 00:03:10,272
I didn't get a chance to thank you before I crashed

47
00:03:10,278 --> 00:03:13,422
for getting in touch with me after the whole shooting thing.

48
00:03:13,628 --> 00:03:17,443
It's a pretty good deal, right? You know, take a bullet, get a call from Jake.

49
00:03:17,566 --> 00:03:20,133
I really wish I could have been there for you, Peyton.

50
00:03:20,225 --> 00:03:21,481
I know.

51
00:03:22,698 --> 00:03:26,363
So, listen -- this is all kind of last-minute, but I actually sort of had plans today.

52
00:03:26,376 --> 00:03:28,652
Oh. Yeah, of course you do. I'm sorry, I --

53
00:03:28,655 --> 00:03:33,093
No, it's just that Jenny and I, we usually spend saturday mornings in the park,

54
00:03:33,938 --> 00:03:36,171
so I thought maybe you'd like to come.

55
00:03:37,336 --> 00:03:39,071
That sounds perfect.

56
00:03:44,537 --> 00:03:45,832
Excuse me.

57
00:03:46,388 --> 00:03:47,831
You're Haley, right?

58
00:03:47,837 --> 00:03:49,080
Yeah.

59
00:03:49,475 --> 00:03:52,010
You look good in blue. It suits you.

60
00:03:52,015 --> 00:03:52,990
Thanks.

61
00:03:52,997 --> 00:03:54,833
You know what else would look good on you?

62
00:03:55,378 --> 00:03:56,762
Me.

63
00:03:57,907 --> 00:03:59,511
I'm Damien West.

64
00:03:59,515 --> 00:04:01,121
I think you're out of your league.

65
00:04:02,377 --> 00:04:03,701
Nathan Scott.

66
00:04:03,708 --> 00:04:04,991
You two know each other?

67
00:04:04,996 --> 00:04:06,112
High Flyers.

68
00:04:06,117 --> 00:04:07,713
You still missing your free throws, West?

69
00:04:07,716 --> 00:04:10,902
Who cares? They don't show free throws on "sportscenter."

70
00:04:10,908 --> 00:04:12,691
You know what else they don't show?

71
00:04:12,797 --> 00:04:14,370
Ravens.

72
00:04:15,386 --> 00:04:19,373
Hey, I heard you guys lost your shooter, so I guess your season's over, huh?

73
00:04:19,387 --> 00:04:20,752
No, I don't think so.

74
00:04:20,757 --> 00:04:23,712
Well, unless you win this tournament, you're not making postseason,

75
00:04:23,715 --> 00:04:27,250
and you're not gonna win this tournament because we are,

76
00:04:27,378 --> 00:04:28,761
and we're undefeated.

77
00:04:28,767 --> 00:04:30,230
For now.

78
00:04:30,907 --> 00:04:32,280
Let's go, Hales.

79
00:04:36,465 --> 00:04:38,530
See ya on the court, Scott.

80
00:04:38,535 --> 00:04:42,113
And, Haley, I'll see you in your dreams.

81
00:04:42,217 --> 00:04:43,932
Peyton Sawyer.

82
00:04:44,075 --> 00:04:46,091
It's so crazy that you're here.

83
00:04:46,126 --> 00:04:47,820
I think when my dad told me to follow my heart,

84
00:04:47,825 --> 00:04:51,260
he  didn't anticipate me following it all the way down to Savannah for the weekend.

85
00:04:52,205 --> 00:04:53,831
How's your life, Jake?

86
00:04:55,015 --> 00:04:56,861
Twice a week it's awesome.

87
00:04:57,286 --> 00:04:59,241
Those are the days I get Jenny.

88
00:04:59,248 --> 00:05:00,073
What?

89
00:05:00,078 --> 00:05:02,143
Yeah, it's a long story.

90
00:05:02,846 --> 00:05:05,352
Basically -- hey, let's go.

91
00:05:05,368 --> 00:05:07,262
Come on. Come on. Let's go.

92
00:05:07,267 --> 00:05:10,330
Basically, when Nicki left Tree Hill,

93
00:05:10,418 --> 00:05:13,622
she took Jenny here to Savannah to be with her parents.

94
00:05:13,636 --> 00:05:16,813
But her parents finally had enough of both of us, so

95
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:19,720
they petitioned the court for custody of Jenny for a year,

96
00:05:19,728 --> 00:05:21,823
just long enough for me and Nicki to prove

97
00:05:21,827 --> 00:05:23,970
that we can keep our lives together, you know?

98
00:05:23,975 --> 00:05:26,863
Like keep a job, stay out of trouble.

99
00:05:26,867 --> 00:05:28,183
Want to go on the slide?

100
00:05:28,238 --> 00:05:30,862
So, wait -- Nicki's here? Come here, baby.

101
00:05:30,878 --> 00:05:32,862
Yeah, she stays with her folks.

102
00:05:32,867 --> 00:05:34,501
She gets Jenny most of the time.

103
00:05:34,508 --> 00:05:37,741
It took me a while to be okay with that, but I actually think she's really trying.

104
00:05:38,025 --> 00:05:42,551
Anyways, basically I can't do anything -- no drinking.

105
00:05:42,555 --> 00:05:46,010
They drug test me -- I mean, not that that even matters, but,

106
00:05:46,027 --> 00:05:47,713
like, I can't get a parking ticket.

107
00:05:47,718 --> 00:05:54,833
I just sleep, work, hope that in a few months I'll get custody of Jenny.

108
00:05:54,996 --> 00:05:56,930
Then I can start my life again, you know?

109
00:06:11,056 --> 00:06:12,871
What are you doing here, Dan?

110
00:06:12,938 --> 00:06:14,830
Just dealing with the past.

111
00:06:15,637 --> 00:06:17,870
I heard you were home. I wanted to see you.

112
00:06:20,597 --> 00:06:21,793
You look good.

113
00:06:21,796 --> 00:06:23,031
You look terrible.

114
00:06:23,037 --> 00:06:24,801
Well, I haven't been sleeping very well.

115
00:06:24,805 --> 00:06:27,853
Truth is, I've been struggling quite a bit ever since Keith, um...

116
00:06:30,217 --> 00:06:32,080
I'm trying here, Deb, okay?

117
00:06:32,087 --> 00:06:35,052
I just thought now that you're back and Nathan's moved out,

118
00:06:35,055 --> 00:06:37,063
maybe you're lonely in such a big house.

119
00:06:37,066 --> 00:06:38,460
She's not.

120
00:06:39,297 --> 00:06:42,931
Well, well, it's the racecar-crashing brother.

121
00:06:42,937 --> 00:06:44,172
You staying at my house now, Cooper?

122
00:06:44,175 --> 00:06:46,340
Actually, I'm staying at my sister's house.

123
00:06:46,368 --> 00:06:49,713
And because it is my sister's house, I don't think we'll be seeing much of you around here,

124
00:06:49,726 --> 00:06:51,652
unless,  of course, you're invited.

125
00:06:53,575 --> 00:06:55,621
You have a problem with me, kid?

126
00:06:55,635 --> 00:06:59,432
No,  but you definitely have a problem with me.

127
00:06:59,436 --> 00:07:01,030
What the hell is this?

128
00:07:01,035 --> 00:07:02,682
Dad, just go home.

129
00:07:02,688 --> 00:07:04,622
I could say the same thing to you, Nathan.

130
00:07:04,625 --> 00:07:06,311
I heard you moved back in with Hades --

131
00:07:06,317 --> 00:07:07,590
I meant "Haley."

132
00:07:07,595 --> 00:07:09,473
Dad, I'm serious. Let's go.

133
00:07:10,915 --> 00:07:12,411
Don't be a stranger, Cooper.

134
00:07:12,417 --> 00:07:13,783
Dad, come on.

135
00:07:16,955 --> 00:07:18,102
Welcome home.

136
00:07:20,147 --> 00:07:23,452
Oh, the kid's finally playing well. Try not to almost kill him while you're back.

137
00:07:23,457 --> 00:07:24,811
Just go, dad.

138
00:07:24,817 --> 00:07:27,331
I'm going. I'm going.

139
00:07:31,547 --> 00:07:35,170
Dad, what the hell is wrong with you? Don't you think maybe mom's had enough?

140
00:07:35,176 --> 00:07:36,482
It's my house, Nathan.

141
00:07:36,487 --> 00:07:39,552
No, it's not. It's not your house, and she's not your wife.

142
00:07:39,566 --> 00:07:42,043
Now, damn it, dad, you've got to stop this crap.

143
00:07:42,098 --> 00:07:43,472
Or what?!

144
00:07:43,472 --> 00:07:45,616
I'm the freakin' mayor of this town, Nathan.

145
00:07:45,617 --> 00:07:48,176
I can go wherever the hell I want and do whatever the hell I please.

146
00:07:48,170 --> 00:07:49,032
Do you hear me?!

147
00:07:49,037 --> 00:07:51,690
Yeah, I hear you. So do the neighbors, Mr. Mayor.

148
00:07:52,476 --> 00:07:54,062
This is my house.

149
00:07:54,066 --> 00:07:55,673
I worked hard to build it,

150
00:07:55,678 --> 00:07:59,010
and if I want, I'll burn the damn thing down and everything in it.

151
00:08:13,658 --> 00:08:15,310
He's getting worse, mom.

152
00:08:17,518 --> 00:08:19,392
He's never gonna change, my dad.

153
00:08:19,398 --> 00:08:22,450
I can totally see him resorting to the same manipulative crap.

154
00:08:22,458 --> 00:08:26,561
I'm sorry. I wish I could just take you away from all that.

155
00:08:27,108 --> 00:08:28,610
Ever hear from Lucas and Karen?

156
00:08:28,626 --> 00:08:32,653
No. Lucas said they were just gonna get on the road and drive.

157
00:08:32,658 --> 00:08:35,330
I think they probably just need a break at this point.

158
00:08:35,467 --> 00:08:39,000
Plus, Karen doesn't really want him around the tournament when he can't play, you know?

159
00:08:39,006 --> 00:08:40,012
Yeah.

160
00:08:43,988 --> 00:08:45,332
Thank you.

161
00:08:46,047 --> 00:08:47,583
You're welcome.

162
00:08:50,177 --> 00:08:51,470
Does that ever hurt?

163
00:08:51,475 --> 00:08:52,732
No.

164
00:08:53,025 --> 00:08:55,611
The scar stopped hurting when my heart stopped hurting,

165
00:08:55,615 --> 00:08:57,653
right around the time you came home.

166
00:09:01,626 --> 00:09:02,830
Okay.

167
00:09:04,218 --> 00:09:05,683
Where'd you go?

168
00:09:06,347 --> 00:09:10,181
Oh, I get it. This is the no-sex thing, right? I totally got you, didn't I?

169
00:09:10,188 --> 00:09:10,791
No.

170
00:09:10,796 --> 00:09:13,403
I told you I was sexy, Haley. Don't lie.

171
00:09:15,387 --> 00:09:16,923
Okay, maybe.

172
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:38,780
You know, that's really not fair.

173
00:09:38,785 --> 00:09:40,460
I mean, it's one thing to break my heart,

174
00:09:40,467 --> 00:09:43,430
but do you have to look like a beer commercial while you're doing it?

175
00:09:43,437 --> 00:09:44,501
I've been calling you.

176
00:09:44,508 --> 00:09:47,740
Yeah, I just figured you were busy with old man river.

177
00:09:48,038 --> 00:09:49,810
He's not that much older than us.

178
00:09:50,045 --> 00:09:52,100
Come on, Rachel. I'm not an idiot.

179
00:09:52,106 --> 00:09:55,682
Or actually maybe I am, thinking you were into me.

180
00:09:56,096 --> 00:09:59,023
I mean, let's see -- we spent a ton of time together.

181
00:09:59,027 --> 00:10:01,282
We flirted, kissed a few times.

182
00:10:01,288 --> 00:10:03,533
Mouth, I didn't mean to lead you on.

183
00:10:03,876 --> 00:10:05,900
It happened anyway, didn't it?

184
00:10:06,457 --> 00:10:09,140
I mean, I said I wasn't gonna fall for you,

185
00:10:09,147 --> 00:10:10,633
but I kissed you,

186
00:10:10,635 --> 00:10:13,272
and I woke up wanting to do it again.

187
00:10:13,615 --> 00:10:15,531
And now here we are.

188
00:10:18,537 --> 00:10:19,812
Stop!

189
00:10:20,416 --> 00:10:22,862
Oh, I thought witches were supposed to melt.

190
00:10:22,865 --> 00:10:24,042
What the hell is wrong with you?

191
00:10:24,046 --> 00:10:25,231
What the hell is wrong with me?

192
00:10:25,235 --> 00:10:28,003
I'm not the freak with the plastic ass and the tin heart.

193
00:10:28,006 --> 00:10:30,652
You're the freak with the fat ass and no heart!

194
00:10:30,657 --> 00:10:32,411
You know what, girl formerly know as orca?

195
00:10:32,416 --> 00:10:33,862
You led Mouth on and you know it,

196
00:10:33,866 --> 00:10:36,433
so maybe it's time you get back in touch with your inner sperm whale

197
00:10:36,438 --> 00:10:38,670
and realize you now have fewer friends than you did before.

198
00:10:38,675 --> 00:10:41,682
Really? Well, my new friend Lucas just called me.

199
00:10:41,688 --> 00:10:43,363
Call you lately?

200
00:10:43,475 --> 00:10:44,662
Didn't think so.

201
00:10:44,666 --> 00:10:46,950
You know, Rachel, I would punch you in your fake nose right now,

202
00:10:46,955 --> 00:10:48,523
but you'd just go out and buy another one.

203
00:10:48,537 --> 00:10:49,760
Enough.

204
00:10:49,778 --> 00:10:53,000
Just... Never mind.

205
00:10:54,217 --> 00:10:56,541
I am gonna make you regret this.

206
00:11:03,367 --> 00:11:05,722
So, that building right there -- that's the courthouse.

207
00:11:05,725 --> 00:11:08,363
That's where the judge scared the crap out of me and Nicki.

208
00:11:08,368 --> 00:11:10,381
Oh, and that alleyway right there?

209
00:11:10,385 --> 00:11:11,882
That's where I threw up...

210
00:11:11,888 --> 00:11:13,663
Before and after the hearing.

211
00:11:13,675 --> 00:11:15,380
- Good work.
- Yeah.

212
00:11:15,637 --> 00:11:20,762
And that building on the corner there -- that's the Savannah College of Art and Design.

213
00:11:20,765 --> 00:11:22,043
Didn't throw up there.

214
00:11:22,056 --> 00:11:24,103
I hope not. That place is awesome.

215
00:11:24,117 --> 00:11:25,483
That's what I hear.

216
00:11:25,487 --> 00:11:28,320
And then every other building in Savannah is either haunted

217
00:11:28,327 --> 00:11:33,122
by some crazy ghost or witch or gremlin or something. I don't know.

218
00:11:33,127 --> 00:11:35,991
Any by a sarcastic goth angel?

219
00:11:36,326 --> 00:11:37,472
What?

220
00:11:37,968 --> 00:11:39,282
Nothing.

221
00:11:39,288 --> 00:11:40,850
We all have our ghosts, right?

222
00:11:40,857 --> 00:11:42,270
Yeah.

223
00:11:43,767 --> 00:11:48,472
So, anyway, this drink is like nectar from heaven. You need to try it.

224
00:11:48,745 --> 00:11:50,182
Okay.

225
00:11:53,648 --> 00:11:57,162
Jake! Come here. You're a mess.

226
00:11:57,167 --> 00:11:58,852
I know. I got it.

227
00:12:05,685 --> 00:12:09,103
Do you want to get some food with that drink?

228
00:12:09,575 --> 00:12:11,013
Yeah.

229
00:12:11,137 --> 00:12:14,662
There's a place right around the corner actually that's pretty good.

230
00:12:16,805 --> 00:12:19,881
I can't believe you squirted Rachel in the face with her own hose.

231
00:12:19,888 --> 00:12:22,132
She's just lucky the golf ball didn't hit her.

232
00:12:22,136 --> 00:12:24,143
She probably sucked it out first.

233
00:12:24,817 --> 00:12:26,282
Mouth!

234
00:12:28,035 --> 00:12:31,240
Nathan's hot uncle Cooper's in town. Oh, my god. How do I look?

235
00:12:31,247 --> 00:12:33,262
Like Lucas' girlfriend.

236
00:12:34,627 --> 00:12:36,581
Wait a minute. Is that him?

237
00:12:36,595 --> 00:12:37,980
Nice, huh?

238
00:12:37,987 --> 00:12:39,790
I'd love me some uncle Cooper.

239
00:12:39,797 --> 00:12:41,472
Yeah, well, you're gonna hate this.

240
00:12:41,475 --> 00:12:43,753
Uncle Cooper is Rachel's new boyfriend.

241
00:12:43,757 --> 00:12:46,171
What? No!

242
00:12:46,175 --> 00:12:47,922
No, that is not fair!

243
00:12:47,927 --> 00:12:50,462
Okay, can I just reiterate my whole broken-heart scenario?

244
00:12:50,468 --> 00:12:53,742
But if I had known that he would date a girl in high school, I mean, I would have --

245
00:12:53,965 --> 00:12:55,172
He wouldn't.

246
00:12:55,178 --> 00:12:57,200
Mouth, I know Cooper.

247
00:12:57,207 --> 00:12:59,543
There is no way he would date a high-school girl.

248
00:12:59,546 --> 00:13:01,122
But I'm sure that was him.

249
00:13:01,127 --> 00:13:03,263
I'm not saying it wasn't him.

250
00:13:03,267 --> 00:13:06,110
I'm saying he doesn't know how old Rachel is...

251
00:13:06,838 --> 00:13:08,321
yet.

252
00:13:08,508 --> 00:13:13,282
I think it's time Franken-Rachel felt a little of the heartache you're feeling.

253
00:13:16,947 --> 00:13:19,063
Hey, Jake, can I ask you a question?

254
00:13:19,098 --> 00:13:24,280
Um, look, I know Nicki's around now, and so I was just wondering, are you guys --

255
00:13:24,286 --> 00:13:25,521
No.

256
00:13:25,947 --> 00:13:28,242
No. But one of the hardest things for me to accept was

257
00:13:28,255 --> 00:13:31,060
that Nicki and I are always gonna have Jenny in common

258
00:13:31,068 --> 00:13:33,441
and that Jenny should know who her mother is.

259
00:13:33,447 --> 00:13:34,711
I mean, you can understand that, right?

260
00:13:34,717 --> 00:13:36,882
- Yeah.
- But no, no.

261
00:13:37,127 --> 00:13:38,633
Not together.

262
00:13:39,736 --> 00:13:41,690
How about you? You seeing anybody?

263
00:13:41,696 --> 00:13:45,113
Me? I mean -- not really.

264
00:13:45,456 --> 00:13:48,411
I was kind of dating Pete Wentz from Fall Out Boy.

265
00:13:48,415 --> 00:13:49,412
Yeah.

266
00:13:49,416 --> 00:13:51,833
Well, I've been dating Shakira most nights,

267
00:13:51,835 --> 00:13:54,123
but she doesn't really know about it.

268
00:13:54,427 --> 00:13:56,320
I'm serious, actually.

269
00:13:56,326 --> 00:13:59,922
It sounds weird, but it just kind of happened, so...

270
00:13:59,938 --> 00:14:01,513
That sucks.

271
00:14:01,517 --> 00:14:04,763
I mean, not that you dated a guy. It's just that...

272
00:14:04,826 --> 00:14:06,641
you dated a rock star.

273
00:14:06,937 --> 00:14:08,652
Musicians -- they're trouble, you know?

274
00:14:08,665 --> 00:14:10,771
Well, we'd love to start playing for y'all,

275
00:14:10,778 --> 00:14:14,342
whenever our lead singer decides to stop flirting with those pretty girls.

276
00:14:14,847 --> 00:14:16,103
Come  on, man.

277
00:14:16,107 --> 00:14:17,630
Second job.

278
00:14:19,455 --> 00:14:21,932
I'm telling you -- you got to watch out for those musicians.

279
00:14:27,016 --> 00:14:28,623
How you doing tonight?

280
00:14:30,646 --> 00:14:34,202
So, I wrote this song for somebody special.

281
00:14:34,208 --> 00:14:36,070
It's called "Someday."

282
00:14:48,716 --> 00:14:53,482
# It's the biggest storm in years, they say #

283
00:14:54,436 --> 00:14:58,830
# Couldn't take a plane so I hopped a train #

284
00:15:00,346 --> 00:15:05,913
# 'Cause I like to stay in a stormy winter day #

285
00:15:06,406 --> 00:15:11,581
# So I'll come back to you someday #

286
00:15:15,098 --> 00:15:20,110
# As the days flow by it's all so clear #

287
00:15:21,106 --> 00:15:26,023
# I've been everywhere but never right here #

288
00:15:26,605 --> 00:15:29,352
# It's always the same #

289
00:15:29,357 --> 00:15:32,702
# Coffee and change #

290
00:15:32,745 --> 00:15:37,740
# But I'll come back to you someday #

291
00:15:40,947 --> 00:15:45,282
# I'll travel all night just to see your face #

292
00:15:46,756 --> 00:15:51,373
# The way you touch, the way you taste #

293
00:15:52,698 --> 00:15:57,973
# Even if only for a day #

294
00:15:58,307 --> 00:16:03,463
# 'Cause I'll come back to you someday #

295
00:16:06,925 --> 00:16:09,910
# So close, so far #

296
00:16:09,915 --> 00:16:13,981
# Some other world #

297
00:16:15,556 --> 00:16:19,771
# It's spinning me away, yeah, yeah, yeah #

298
00:16:19,787 --> 00:16:22,930
#  I'll say so close, so far #

299
00:16:22,946 --> 00:16:27,343
# Some other world #

300
00:16:28,686 --> 00:16:33,071
# Spinning me away #

301
00:16:33,448 --> 00:16:38,582
# Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah... #

302
00:16:41,975 --> 00:16:45,253
#  It's spinning me away #

303
00:16:51,345 --> 00:16:53,512
Mmm, you're late.

304
00:16:53,877 --> 00:16:56,280
But I look hot enough to get away with it, right?

305
00:16:56,285 --> 00:16:57,712
Maybe.

306
00:17:02,376 --> 00:17:03,262
Nice house.

307
00:17:03,265 --> 00:17:05,453
Well, thank you, but it's my sister's.

308
00:17:05,457 --> 00:17:07,002
You want the tour?

309
00:17:07,007 --> 00:17:11,201
Mmm... mostly I'm just interested in the bedroom.

310
00:17:11,206 --> 00:17:12,942
Oh, that's so not fair.

311
00:17:12,945 --> 00:17:14,380
It's upstairs.

312
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:39,542
Did you know that Savannah is literally built on the dead?

313
00:17:39,547 --> 00:17:41,832
They placed cemeteries all over the city, and then

314
00:17:41,836 --> 00:17:44,481
as it grew they just kind of built on top of them.

315
00:17:44,487 --> 00:17:46,622
Great. I can't wait to go to bed tonight.

316
00:17:47,925 --> 00:17:51,002
But I guess you're not gonna be there to protect me, right?

317
00:17:53,278 --> 00:17:56,742
You didn't sleep on the couch last night 'cause of Jenny, did you?

318
00:17:56,758 --> 00:18:00,012
Peyton, you need to know that when I saw your face in the airport,

319
00:18:00,328 --> 00:18:02,932
I don't think I've been that happy since I've been here.

320
00:18:02,936 --> 00:18:04,231
But?

321
00:18:04,567 --> 00:18:06,682
People always leave, right?

322
00:18:09,985 --> 00:18:13,423
There's this on-ramp that I pass every day on my way to work.

323
00:18:14,388 --> 00:18:17,782
Every day I think, "I could get on that on-ramp,

324
00:18:17,797 --> 00:18:21,803
and I'd be in Tree Hill in 6 hours, 24 minutes".

325
00:18:21,927 --> 00:18:23,362
And I'd be with you.

326
00:18:23,368 --> 00:18:25,091
But I'd be without Jenny.

327
00:18:25,098 --> 00:18:27,143
And I can't do that.

328
00:18:27,148 --> 00:18:30,293
You could have called on the phone and told me that.

329
00:18:31,045 --> 00:18:32,822
It's not like you're in hiding.

330
00:18:32,828 --> 00:18:35,230
It would have been too hard to heard your voice, Peyton,

331
00:18:35,488 --> 00:18:37,683
to feel us again.

332
00:18:38,027 --> 00:18:40,243
My life is here now.

333
00:18:40,317 --> 00:18:42,913
And as much as I would love to, I'd --

334
00:18:43,247 --> 00:18:44,681
you're leaving.

335
00:18:44,986 --> 00:18:48,213
And I'm the one that's gonna be left with this dull pain in my heart,

336
00:18:48,218 --> 00:18:52,450
and that pain -- it took me a long time to let go of.

337
00:18:53,468 --> 00:18:55,010
Sorry.

338
00:18:56,906 --> 00:18:58,341
It's okay.

339
00:18:59,287 --> 00:19:01,772
I get it. Trust me.

340
00:19:09,308 --> 00:19:11,351
Peyton. Peyton!

341
00:19:11,736 --> 00:19:15,772
You know what? Every song ends, Jake. Is that any reason not to enjoy the music?

342
00:19:18,438 --> 00:19:21,322
Forget it. I'll just -- I'll see you tomorrow.

343
00:20:00,058 --> 00:20:01,353
You okay?

344
00:20:01,357 --> 00:20:03,423
Yeah, I'm just dreaming.

345
00:20:04,845 --> 00:20:07,271
I guess the world's still out there.

346
00:20:09,725 --> 00:20:13,082
You know, I have a chance to make some overtime today,

347
00:20:13,086 --> 00:20:14,682
but I can call and cancel if you want.

348
00:20:14,685 --> 00:20:17,410
No, no, no, no, no. You should go. I can spend the day alone.

349
00:20:17,428 --> 00:20:20,123
Or I could make a call and maybe I could get you Jenny for the day.

350
00:20:20,127 --> 00:20:21,682
Could you really?

351
00:20:21,685 --> 00:20:24,630
Jake, that would be great. I love that little girl.

352
00:20:24,636 --> 00:20:27,960
I know you do, and I love you for that.

353
00:20:31,307 --> 00:20:33,020
Where's your head at, Peyton?

354
00:20:33,026 --> 00:20:34,563
- Me?
- Yeah.

355
00:20:34,565 --> 00:20:36,993
Uh, I'm all over the place.

356
00:20:37,135 --> 00:20:39,443
I don't know. It's just like --

357
00:20:39,695 --> 00:20:42,563
like, you know that feeling you get on a sunday

358
00:20:42,568 --> 00:20:44,752
where you just have the whole day to yourself,

359
00:20:44,755 --> 00:20:48,331
and it's been great, and then you remember you have to go to school the next day,

360
00:20:48,335 --> 00:20:50,902
so it ruins the rest of the night?

361
00:20:51,397 --> 00:20:55,622
I have to go home tomorrow, and so I've got that feeling.

362
00:20:55,636 --> 00:20:57,381
It's like sunday night.

363
00:20:57,385 --> 00:21:02,322
You know, somebody once told me that every song ends,

364
00:21:02,327 --> 00:21:04,813
but that's no reason not to enjoy the music.

365
00:21:04,815 --> 00:21:06,543
Ellie told me that.

366
00:21:06,546 --> 00:21:08,252
Well, she was right.

367
00:21:08,825 --> 00:21:10,702
Tomorrow's gonna hurt like hell.

368
00:21:10,706 --> 00:21:12,211
We both know that.

369
00:21:12,217 --> 00:21:15,492
But we're here together now, hmm?

370
00:21:19,276 --> 00:21:22,043
Marvin McFabulous, I wasn't sure you were gonna make it.

371
00:21:22,045 --> 00:21:23,441
Actually, I got here early.

372
00:21:23,445 --> 00:21:26,150
Well, welcome to the dark side, my friend --

373
00:21:26,158 --> 00:21:30,092
deception for lunch, payback for dinner, and pie for breakfast?

374
00:21:30,096 --> 00:21:31,953
You guys want some breakfast?

375
00:21:31,958 --> 00:21:33,543
- Pie.
- Pie.

376
00:21:34,947 --> 00:21:36,752
- Hi there.
- Hi.

377
00:21:36,758 --> 00:21:38,253
Just a cup of coffee, please.

378
00:21:38,256 --> 00:21:40,422
Hot uncle Cooper!

379
00:21:41,356 --> 00:21:43,310
Why don't you come join us?

380
00:21:43,326 --> 00:21:44,472
Hey, Brooke.

381
00:21:44,476 --> 00:21:45,362
Hi.

382
00:21:45,367 --> 00:21:46,663
Hey, I'm Cooper.

383
00:21:46,667 --> 00:21:48,522
Hey, I'm, uh, Steve.

384
00:21:48,528 --> 00:21:51,111
Yeah, you're the flower delivery guy, right?

385
00:21:51,118 --> 00:21:52,912
- How's it going?
- Oh, I've been better.

386
00:21:52,917 --> 00:21:55,292
You know, my girl never did say who those flowers were from.

387
00:21:55,297 --> 00:21:56,990
She wouldn't tell you?

388
00:21:56,997 --> 00:21:58,631
Sounds like a shady character.

389
00:21:58,637 --> 00:22:01,633
No, no, I just think it was personal, that's all.

390
00:22:01,647 --> 00:22:04,853
All she'd say is that they were from somebody she really cared about.

391
00:22:04,857 --> 00:22:07,142
Look, we all have our histories, right?

392
00:22:07,177 --> 00:22:09,932
I just think this guy must have meant something to her.

393
00:22:09,937 --> 00:22:12,953
Anyway, you guys don't want to hear about that.

394
00:22:13,056 --> 00:22:15,700
So this is like home court for you two, right? What's good here?

395
00:22:15,707 --> 00:22:19,870
I ordered the pie, but I don't think I have the stomach for it.

396
00:22:19,878 --> 00:22:20,791
But --

397
00:22:20,795 --> 00:22:23,462
This new girlfriend -- you care about her, right?

398
00:22:23,467 --> 00:22:24,940
Yeah, I do.

399
00:22:24,995 --> 00:22:26,543
That's good.

400
00:22:26,958 --> 00:22:28,443
Take care of her.

401
00:22:28,448 --> 00:22:29,881
Okay.

402
00:22:32,706 --> 00:22:35,511
Mouth, what about the plan?

403
00:22:35,516 --> 00:22:37,541
Payback? Pain? Pie?

404
00:22:37,546 --> 00:22:38,651
She's lying to him.

405
00:22:38,658 --> 00:22:41,652
I know, but I got to talk to Rachel first, okay?

406
00:22:44,277 --> 00:22:46,193
I really wanted pie.

407
00:22:48,548 --> 00:22:49,752
Hey.

408
00:22:51,276 --> 00:22:52,821
How you feeling, sleepyhead?

409
00:22:52,826 --> 00:22:54,643
Ohh, like ass.

410
00:22:54,648 --> 00:22:56,113
Mmm, sorry.

411
00:22:57,256 --> 00:22:59,703
Lucky for you, this cures that.

412
00:22:59,708 --> 00:23:01,333
I hope so.

413
00:23:01,528 --> 00:23:03,230
Oh, thank you.

414
00:23:04,178 --> 00:23:06,473
I am wiped out.

415
00:23:07,347 --> 00:23:09,341
We just got to win this one last game, though.

416
00:23:09,346 --> 00:23:12,920
Otherwise whitey has to retire without making the playoffs.

417
00:23:13,415 --> 00:23:15,503
Well, we can't let that happen.

418
00:23:17,246 --> 00:23:18,480
Where does it hurt?

419
00:23:18,488 --> 00:23:19,853
Everywhere.

420
00:23:21,666 --> 00:23:23,311
You guys are playing Oak Lake tonight?

421
00:23:23,316 --> 00:23:25,553
Yeah. They're undefeated.

422
00:23:25,788 --> 00:23:28,721
My boyfriend Damien West is good?

423
00:23:28,726 --> 00:23:30,073
Yeah, he's pretty good.

424
00:23:30,078 --> 00:23:34,213
He's an ass, though, sort of like a young version of my dad.

425
00:23:35,108 --> 00:23:39,282
It's actually hurt me to see what's happened with your relationship with Dan.

426
00:23:39,865 --> 00:23:42,871
I just -- especially now that you're playing so well.

427
00:23:42,875 --> 00:23:44,832
You should be able to enjoy that with your father.

428
00:23:44,835 --> 00:23:47,582
Yeah. It's a little late for that, though.

429
00:23:47,928 --> 00:23:49,703
Probably just as well.

430
00:23:49,707 --> 00:23:52,521
The way I've been feeling, I don't think I have another great game in me.

431
00:23:52,538 --> 00:23:54,933
I don't believe that for a second.

432
00:23:55,557 --> 00:23:57,703
Besides, I'm gonna help you,

433
00:23:57,708 --> 00:24:00,820
and Damien West doesn't stand a chance.

434
00:24:01,306 --> 00:24:02,973
I love you. You know that?

435
00:24:02,978 --> 00:24:04,001
I love you, too.

436
00:24:04,007 --> 00:24:05,612
You always help me.

437
00:24:07,966 --> 00:24:10,321
Damn it, you need to put a shirt on.

438
00:24:10,327 --> 00:24:12,990
You're too sexy! God!

439
00:24:14,028 --> 00:24:16,311
Take a look at this building right over here.

440
00:24:16,318 --> 00:24:20,302
That's where daddy fought for you, and then he threw up in the alley.

441
00:24:20,367 --> 00:24:25,531
And then right over here is the Savannah College of Art and Design...

442
00:24:29,696 --> 00:24:31,891
...where maybe I'll go one day.

443
00:24:31,897 --> 00:24:34,713
That way I can spend more time with you and daddy.

444
00:24:40,568 --> 00:24:43,040
How's it feel knowing your man's season ends tonight?

445
00:24:43,047 --> 00:24:44,150
Don't count on it.

446
00:24:44,166 --> 00:24:46,093
Ooh, you smell great.

447
00:24:46,097 --> 00:24:47,221
I can't wait to see how you taste.

448
00:24:47,227 --> 00:24:49,080
Get off me!

449
00:24:49,195 --> 00:24:52,042
It's okay. Give into it, baby.

450
00:24:52,637 --> 00:24:55,691
Hey, Damien West? Dan Scott.

451
00:24:56,046 --> 00:24:58,022
That's Mayor Dan Scott,

452
00:24:58,028 --> 00:25:00,743
and if you ever touch my daughter-in-law, Haley, again,

453
00:25:00,748 --> 00:25:02,662
I'll end your career.

454
00:25:02,688 --> 00:25:04,283
Have a good game.

455
00:25:08,335 --> 00:25:10,670
Jake, we're home!

456
00:25:12,128 --> 00:25:14,571
Hey, there's my girl.

457
00:25:14,577 --> 00:25:16,592
- Come on.
- Go see dada.

458
00:25:22,077 --> 00:25:24,062
How was your day -- okay?

459
00:25:24,608 --> 00:25:26,761
People always leave, right?

460
00:25:26,768 --> 00:25:29,051
I mean, that's why you and I can't be together --

461
00:25:29,057 --> 00:25:31,532
because you have to stay, and I have to go back to Tree Hill.

462
00:25:31,536 --> 00:25:35,613
But I was thinking -- why do I have to go back?

463
00:25:35,768 --> 00:25:39,442
Jake... I want to stay.

464
00:25:39,457 --> 00:25:41,531
I want to stay here with you.

465
00:25:45,316 --> 00:25:46,702
Hey, Nathan.

466
00:25:48,786 --> 00:25:49,912
Nathan.

467
00:25:50,658 --> 00:25:52,351
Look, dad...

468
00:25:53,468 --> 00:25:55,112
What is this?

469
00:25:55,736 --> 00:26:00,600
You said you were gonna back off, Dan, with me and with Nathan.

470
00:26:00,626 --> 00:26:02,131
A restraining order?

471
00:26:02,136 --> 00:26:07,561
It requires you to stay at least 100 feet away from us at all times, starting tonight.

472
00:26:08,296 --> 00:26:10,053
Sorry, Mr. Mayor.

473
00:26:12,405 --> 00:26:13,883
You signed off on this, Nathan?

474
00:26:13,886 --> 00:26:16,863
Yeah. Actually, dad, it was my idea.

475
00:26:40,006 --> 00:26:42,600
All night, Scott. You can't stop me.

476
00:26:45,136 --> 00:26:48,581
Take a look at the scoreboard. In case you can't count, it's tied.

477
00:26:49,177 --> 00:26:52,011
Come on, Damien! This guy owns you!

478
00:26:55,488 --> 00:26:57,111
You did that on purpose!

479
00:26:57,118 --> 00:26:58,793
Hey, bitch, get off!

480
00:26:58,798 --> 00:27:00,423
Break it up! Break it up.

481
00:27:04,948 --> 00:27:06,203
You're okay?

482
00:27:06,847 --> 00:27:07,940
Let's get set here.

483
00:27:07,948 --> 00:27:09,890
The refs appear to have it under control now.

484
00:27:09,897 --> 00:27:12,820
Nathan Scott steps to the line for two free throws.

485
00:27:12,828 --> 00:27:14,531
Okay, gentlemen, let's get set.

486
00:27:16,275 --> 00:27:18,510
Shooting two. First one's dead.

487
00:27:18,806 --> 00:27:20,770
Hold on, guys. I got blood here.

488
00:27:20,777 --> 00:27:22,102
Coach!

489
00:27:22,107 --> 00:27:25,270
And it looks like Nathan has some blood on his jersey.

490
00:27:25,276 --> 00:27:27,243
Let's hope it's not serious.

491
00:27:32,968 --> 00:27:34,580
He needs stitches.

492
00:27:34,585 --> 00:27:36,423
Sorry, son, you're done for tonight.

493
00:27:36,425 --> 00:27:38,420
What? No way. Forget it.

494
00:27:38,427 --> 00:27:39,931
Nathan, you're bleeding.

495
00:27:39,937 --> 00:27:41,943
Coach, there's no way I'm leaving this game.

496
00:27:41,955 --> 00:27:43,930
If I need stitches, then stitch me up.

497
00:27:43,936 --> 00:27:44,683
Nathan.

498
00:27:44,688 --> 00:27:48,573
Coach, if we lose this game, then you lose your shot at the state championships,

499
00:27:48,585 --> 00:27:50,682
and so do I, so does this team.

500
00:27:50,687 --> 00:27:54,493
And we played in your crappy, old gym. We ran two-a-days until we puked.

501
00:27:54,498 --> 00:27:56,703
I let Tim shower with me.

502
00:27:56,718 --> 00:27:57,823
Come on.

503
00:27:57,837 --> 00:28:01,241
Don't let a punk like Damien West take this away from us.

504
00:28:06,636 --> 00:28:08,772
All right, take him back there and stitch him up.

505
00:28:08,787 --> 00:28:10,602
Find him another jersey.

506
00:28:10,877 --> 00:28:14,721
If his mother says anything about this, it was your idea.

507
00:28:14,976 --> 00:28:16,383
Get in there.

508
00:28:24,447 --> 00:28:26,340
What the hell are you laughing at?

509
00:28:27,566 --> 00:28:29,090
Two things I know --

510
00:28:29,096 --> 00:28:32,020
one, you don't deserve a guy like Mouth,

511
00:28:32,028 --> 00:28:35,830
and two, deception always catches up to you...

512
00:28:35,987 --> 00:28:37,442
Always.

513
00:28:40,088 --> 00:28:43,153
It looks like Nathan Scott is going to have to leave the game.

514
00:28:43,155 --> 00:28:45,340
We'll take a break and be right back.

515
00:28:47,656 --> 00:28:49,020
Hey.

516
00:28:51,108 --> 00:28:52,102
Who's winning?

517
00:28:52,105 --> 00:28:54,021
It's tied, fourth quarter.

518
00:28:56,778 --> 00:29:00,431
So, you want to tell me about this master plan of yours?

519
00:29:00,448 --> 00:29:02,862
What makes you think that you can actually leave Tree Hill?

520
00:29:02,868 --> 00:29:06,282
Well, I'm gonna be out of high school in a couple months anyway, right?

521
00:29:06,288 --> 00:29:09,141
So I can just get my G.E.D. now.

522
00:29:09,146 --> 00:29:11,661
And the College of Art and Design is a great school.

523
00:29:11,666 --> 00:29:14,521
And, I mean, my dad's always gone.

524
00:29:14,527 --> 00:29:18,950
Haley has Nathan, and Brooke has Lucas, so...

525
00:29:19,155 --> 00:29:20,900
maybe I can stay.

526
00:29:21,026 --> 00:29:24,991
You know, Peyton, there's a reason that you're listening to that game tonight.

527
00:29:24,997 --> 00:29:28,872
And I don't care what you say -- you'd miss it, all of it.

528
00:29:28,875 --> 00:29:30,432
Do you miss it?

529
00:29:30,437 --> 00:29:32,002
Every day.

530
00:29:36,445 --> 00:29:37,752
Jake.

531
00:29:40,567 --> 00:29:42,172
Do you love me?

532
00:29:42,968 --> 00:29:44,720
Yeah, I do.

533
00:29:46,135 --> 00:29:48,221
I walked around Savannah all day today,

534
00:29:48,226 --> 00:29:52,022
and I couldn't shake that feeling of it being a sunday evening.

535
00:29:52,027 --> 00:29:54,962
And it's always gonna be without you.

536
00:29:54,968 --> 00:29:56,793
You're the one that makes that feeling go away.

537
00:29:56,797 --> 00:30:01,720
So, yes, there are things about my life that I would miss.

538
00:30:01,727 --> 00:30:03,881
But I'd miss you more.

539
00:30:27,318 --> 00:30:31,403
And the roar you hear is for Nathan Scott stepping back on the court.

540
00:30:32,607 --> 00:30:35,232
And he's wearing Lucas Scott's jersey!

541
00:30:38,048 --> 00:30:39,452
But is it too late?

542
00:30:39,455 --> 00:30:42,350
The Ravens trail by 9, with just over a minute left.

543
00:30:42,718 --> 00:30:44,562
You should have stayed in the locker room, Scott.

544
00:30:44,566 --> 00:30:45,681
Your season's over.

545
00:30:45,695 --> 00:30:47,091
We'll see about that.

546
00:31:01,405 --> 00:31:03,611
Yes! Yay, Nathan!

547
00:31:10,258 --> 00:31:15,331
Another 3 by Nathan, and just like that, the Ravens trail by 3, with 35 seconds left.

548
00:31:15,338 --> 00:31:18,010
Let's hope there's some magic still left in that jersey.

549
00:31:20,768 --> 00:31:21,943
What's the matter, West?

550
00:31:21,948 --> 00:31:23,683
You don't want to take the big shot?

551
00:31:23,948 --> 00:31:25,232
Ball!

552
00:31:32,006 --> 00:31:35,392
Well, well, someone has to make their free throws, huh?

553
00:31:41,887 --> 00:31:43,262
Don't brick it, now.

554
00:31:48,965 --> 00:31:51,670
Take it easy, man. It's an old backboard.

555
00:31:54,805 --> 00:31:58,260
That's right, nice and easy. Don't think about it.

556
00:32:02,956 --> 00:32:05,741
Wow, nice touch.

557
00:32:07,928 --> 00:32:10,991
And the Ravens are gonna get the ball back, down by 3,

558
00:32:10,997 --> 00:32:15,203
with 18 seconds on the clock and Nathan Scott on fire.

559
00:32:15,205 --> 00:32:19,981
I'm telling you, folks -- win or lose, you're gonna regret missing this one.

560
00:32:19,987 --> 00:32:21,640
The two teams are huddled up now.

561
00:32:21,647 --> 00:32:24,020
We'll get back to live action in a moment.

562
00:32:25,857 --> 00:32:27,131
All right, listen to me.

563
00:32:27,135 --> 00:32:30,473
That Scott kid is having the game of his life, so they'll be going to him.

564
00:32:30,475 --> 00:32:32,711
When he catches the ball, you foul him.

565
00:32:32,718 --> 00:32:35,373
They'll only get two free throws, and they're down by three.

566
00:32:35,377 --> 00:32:36,612
I can stop him, coach.

567
00:32:36,617 --> 00:32:39,942
No way, it's too risky. We foul him, end their season.

568
00:32:39,956 --> 00:32:42,321
We get out of here undefeated. Now, let's go, fellows!

569
00:32:42,326 --> 00:32:44,141
- Let's go! Let's go!
- Let's go! Let's go!

570
00:32:44,147 --> 00:32:46,001
- "Win" on 3. 1, 2, 3...
- Win!

571
00:32:46,006 --> 00:32:48,683
Now, you listen to me. When you step out on that floor,

572
00:32:48,686 --> 00:32:52,991
take it all in because someday you're gonna look back on it and want it all again.

573
00:32:52,995 --> 00:32:56,571
When you do, make sure it's for the right reasons.

574
00:32:56,577 --> 00:32:59,533
Win or lose, leave it all on the floor.

575
00:32:59,535 --> 00:33:01,622
Now, "Ravens" on 3.

576
00:33:01,735 --> 00:33:03,972
- 1, 2, 3...
- Ravens!

577
00:33:06,278 --> 00:33:08,723
You know, it's been said that we just don't recognize

578
00:33:08,737 --> 00:33:11,780
the significant moments of our lives while they're happening.

579
00:33:11,785 --> 00:33:16,022
We grow complacent with ideas or things or people, and we take them for granted.

580
00:33:18,177 --> 00:33:21,710
And it's usually not until that thing is about to be taken away from you

581
00:33:21,716 --> 00:33:23,842
that you realize how wrong you've been,

582
00:33:23,846 --> 00:33:26,543
that you realize how much you really need it,

583
00:33:26,556 --> 00:33:28,162
how much you love it.

584
00:33:28,527 --> 00:33:30,583
God, I love this game.

585
00:33:31,847 --> 00:33:33,800
Foul him! Foul!

586
00:33:33,807 --> 00:33:36,490
No way. Nobody fouls him! He's mine!

587
00:33:37,695 --> 00:33:39,600
Come on, Scott. You got nothing.

588
00:33:43,736 --> 00:33:45,430
We got a foul here.

589
00:33:49,848 --> 00:33:53,112
He called a foul! The shot is good, the game is tied,

590
00:33:53,115 --> 00:33:56,721
and there's a foul on Damien West. Unbelievable!

591
00:33:58,028 --> 00:34:02,222
Nathan Scott will get one free throw to win it, with no time left on the clock.

592
00:34:03,935 --> 00:34:08,352
So Nathan Scott will have one free throw to win it for the Ravens.

593
00:34:11,575 --> 00:34:14,420
Okay, you need to make 20 free throws in a row.

594
00:34:14,428 --> 00:34:16,703
You miss one, you start over.

595
00:34:16,705 --> 00:34:18,762
Dad, I'm tired.

596
00:34:18,767 --> 00:34:20,840
Nathan, I'm only trying to make you better.

597
00:34:20,845 --> 00:34:23,000
Someday you're gonna thank me.

598
00:34:32,898 --> 00:34:36,220
You ever heard the expression, "the best things in life are free"?

599
00:34:37,326 --> 00:34:39,370
Well, that expression's true.

600
00:34:39,738 --> 00:34:42,593
Okay, this is it.

601
00:34:44,996 --> 00:34:46,170
Oh, m--

602
00:35:07,077 --> 00:35:10,280
You got nothing, Scott, nothing!

603
00:35:20,337 --> 00:35:23,250
Ravens win it! Ravens win it!

604
00:36:07,706 --> 00:36:10,192
So, you've been quiet tonight.

605
00:36:11,598 --> 00:36:14,290
- I'm worried about you.
- Why?

606
00:36:16,357 --> 00:36:18,380
What if I say you can stay

607
00:36:18,388 --> 00:36:21,652
and somehow we convince your father to let you do it?

608
00:36:22,848 --> 00:36:24,911
This life is hard, Peyton.

609
00:36:25,358 --> 00:36:29,401
You've got all this fire inside of you. I don't want to be the guy that puts that out.

610
00:36:29,407 --> 00:36:32,580
You already did that the night you left Tree Hill.

611
00:36:36,085 --> 00:36:39,052
I've spent a lot of time being miserable, Jake.

612
00:36:39,568 --> 00:36:42,012
It's like misery's an old friend.

613
00:36:42,766 --> 00:36:47,703
And it tricks you sometimes into thinking that it's just always gonna be there,

614
00:36:47,706 --> 00:36:49,780
that you can't be happy.

615
00:36:50,815 --> 00:36:54,390
But you can. You can walk away from pain,

616
00:36:55,325 --> 00:36:58,660
and I think being in love's the best way to do it.

617
00:37:00,148 --> 00:37:02,460
What do you feel when we're together?

618
00:37:03,555 --> 00:37:04,883
Hope.

619
00:37:06,748 --> 00:37:08,543
I do, too.

620
00:37:09,065 --> 00:37:10,960
And we deserve that.

621
00:37:28,747 --> 00:37:30,020
You okay?

622
00:37:30,026 --> 00:37:31,542
Not really.

623
00:37:32,877 --> 00:37:35,223
I kind of got caught in a lie tonight.

624
00:37:35,837 --> 00:37:37,400
With Cooper?

625
00:37:37,645 --> 00:37:39,240
About your age?

626
00:37:41,708 --> 00:37:43,551
I didn't tell him anything.

627
00:37:45,718 --> 00:37:47,092
Why not?

628
00:37:52,206 --> 00:37:55,702
Because if he makes you feel the way that I felt with you,

629
00:37:56,186 --> 00:37:58,400
then I want that for you.

630
00:37:59,685 --> 00:38:01,343
Brooke was right.

631
00:38:02,745 --> 00:38:04,720
I don't deserve you.

632
00:38:05,816 --> 00:38:07,681
I'm sorry, Mouth.

633
00:38:08,805 --> 00:38:11,211
Never say you're sorry, Rachel.

634
00:38:12,226 --> 00:38:15,161
I mean, that was one of your rules, right?

635
00:38:15,267 --> 00:38:17,260
It's a stupid rule.

636
00:38:19,228 --> 00:38:23,643
You know, one of these days you're gonna have to quit lying and just be yourself.

637
00:38:26,087 --> 00:38:28,091
Maybe today's that day.

638
00:38:37,827 --> 00:38:40,580
Hey, you were great tonight.

639
00:38:40,588 --> 00:38:42,243
I think so.

640
00:38:43,317 --> 00:38:44,621
Nathan.

641
00:38:45,427 --> 00:38:48,503
I know. I know. I'm not supposed to get close to you.

642
00:38:48,646 --> 00:38:54,193
But... tonight I walked into that gym the Mayor of Tree Hill...

643
00:38:54,875 --> 00:39:00,710
but I finished the night a father on the outside looking in...

644
00:39:01,515 --> 00:39:04,382
at a son who deserves better.

645
00:39:06,697 --> 00:39:08,930
I wanted to tell you...

646
00:39:09,606 --> 00:39:11,971
how proud of you I am.

647
00:39:12,356 --> 00:39:14,812
And this has nothing to do with basketball.

648
00:39:17,356 --> 00:39:20,592
I'm proud of you for the choices you've made with your life.

649
00:39:21,117 --> 00:39:24,771
I'm proud of you for the man that you've become.

650
00:39:28,405 --> 00:39:29,740
I love you.

651
00:39:34,876 --> 00:39:37,322
Every once in a while, people step up.

652
00:39:37,325 --> 00:39:39,362
They rise above themselves.

653
00:39:40,158 --> 00:39:42,102
Sometimes they surprise you.

654
00:39:43,258 --> 00:39:45,571
- Okay, you can't be here.
- Cooper --

655
00:39:45,578 --> 00:39:47,902
How could you lie like that, huh?

656
00:39:47,907 --> 00:39:49,411
How old are you?

657
00:39:49,416 --> 00:39:51,312
Please tell me you're not a freshman.

658
00:39:51,318 --> 00:39:52,803
I'm 17.

659
00:39:52,808 --> 00:39:56,410
Just relax. In North Carolina I only have to be 16 for us to be together.

660
00:39:56,418 --> 00:40:01,061
Maybe by law, but in my book, you got to be a hell of a lot older than that.

661
00:40:04,828 --> 00:40:06,922
You have to go. I'm sorry.

662
00:40:10,305 --> 00:40:12,482
- Cooper.
- Don't.

663
00:40:18,746 --> 00:40:21,163
You know you still want me, Cooper.

664
00:40:24,296 --> 00:40:25,963
You know it...

665
00:40:29,258 --> 00:40:31,213
...and I know it.

666
00:40:37,888 --> 00:40:39,643
You really should go.

667
00:40:52,358 --> 00:40:54,740
And sometimes they fall short.

668
00:41:01,258 --> 00:41:04,763
Life is funny sometimes. It can push pretty hard.

669
00:41:06,738 --> 00:41:10,392
But if you look close enough, you find hope...

670
00:41:10,395 --> 00:41:12,163
Mama.

671
00:41:13,276 --> 00:41:15,642
...in the words of children...

672
00:41:19,238 --> 00:41:21,563
...in the bars of a song...

673
00:41:25,625 --> 00:41:27,471
What's wrong, Peyton?

674
00:41:27,908 --> 00:41:30,513
...and in the eyes of someone you love.

675
00:41:46,667 --> 00:41:51,613
And if you're lucky -- I mean, if you're the luckiest person on this entire planet --

676
00:41:52,685 --> 00:41:56,210
the person you love decides to love you back.

677
00:41:57,468 --> 00:41:59,340
Do you want to get married?

678
