1
00:00:01,013 --> 00:00:02,523
Previously on "One Tree Hill"...

2
00:00:02,611 --> 00:00:04,652
I'm here to talk about Haley and her music,

3
00:00:04,819 --> 00:00:06,086
not Haley and me.

4
00:00:06,158 --> 00:00:07,300
They're the same thing.

5
00:00:07,403 --> 00:00:10,937
I think you're just a lying junkie who probably doesn't even have cancer.

6
00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:12,343
Just get out, Ellie.

7
00:00:12,592 --> 00:00:13,577
Okay.

8
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:19,415
You're gonna need a bigger sign.

9
00:00:20,017 --> 00:00:22,254
Here's how the fantasy-boy draft works.

10
00:00:22,338 --> 00:00:24,397
Once you pick a guy, he is yours for the season,

11
00:00:24,471 --> 00:00:28,099
which means he's off the market, and no one else can touch him.

12
00:00:28,211 --> 00:00:29,317
Got it, Bevin?

13
00:00:30,076 --> 00:00:32,968
P. Sawyer, you've got the first pick, and you are on the clock.

14
00:00:33,054 --> 00:00:34,200
Mouth McFadden.

15
00:00:34,299 --> 00:00:35,826
I pick Chris Keller. Ha.

16
00:00:35,917 --> 00:00:37,109
Chris Keller goes to Brooke!

17
00:00:37,197 --> 00:00:38,120
Bevin, you're next.

18
00:00:38,207 --> 00:00:40,132
- Uh, actually... 
- There's been a trade.

19
00:00:40,213 --> 00:00:40,869
What?

20
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:42,138
And I pick Lucas.

21
00:00:42,223 --> 00:00:44,134
- Lucas Scott to Rachel.
- But she can't --

22
00:00:44,208 --> 00:00:45,863
- I pick Nathan.
- Nathan Scott to Haley.

23
00:00:45,908 --> 00:00:46,263
Wait!

24
00:00:46,270 --> 00:00:47,972
- I get Skills.
- Skills to Bevin.

25
00:00:48,041 --> 00:00:48,702
Wait!

26
00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:50,770
This is awesome. We all got who we wanted.

27
00:00:50,849 --> 00:00:52,028
Great idea, Brooke.

28
00:01:51,999 --> 00:01:53,200
Morning, baby.

29
00:02:04,032 --> 00:02:05,168
Morning, baby.

30
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:13,760
Bad dream?

31
00:02:19,236 --> 00:02:20,507
How bad was it?

32
00:02:21,234 --> 00:02:23,741
I dreamt that Lucas was in bed with Chris Keller.

33
00:02:23,805 --> 00:02:26,421
Oh. That's pretty bad.

34
00:02:28,818 --> 00:02:30,306
So, you want to make out?

35
00:02:31,349 --> 00:02:32,502
Yeah. Okay. Sure.

36
00:02:43,937 --> 00:02:47,444
Oh, hey, what did Lucas say about you not picking him for the draft?

37
00:02:47,503 --> 00:02:48,600
Not much.

38
00:02:49,278 --> 00:02:51,798
Mostly 'cause I haven't told him yet. You didn't say anything, did you?

39
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,319
No, I haven't said a word.

40
00:02:53,402 --> 00:02:54,202
Okay, good.

41
00:02:54,325 --> 00:02:57,002
Ooh! Did I mention that my designs were a total hit

42
00:02:57,078 --> 00:02:59,052
with the corporate big stuffs over at Suburban Filth?

43
00:02:59,126 --> 00:03:00,846
They might pick them up for a fashion line.

44
00:03:00,927 --> 00:03:04,117
Oh, my god, Brooke. That's incredible. You must be so happy...

45
00:03:04,808 --> 00:03:05,904
or not.

46
00:03:06,532 --> 00:03:09,180
What is she doing talking to that troll?

47
00:03:09,286 --> 00:03:11,039
By "troll," do you mean Peyton?

48
00:03:13,715 --> 00:03:16,750
Hi, backstabbing supposed-to-be best friend and all.

49
00:03:16,829 --> 00:03:19,881
Hi, forgot-to-say-good-morning, sneery grouch-a-lot.

50
00:03:19,991 --> 00:03:23,958
I am out of here, overpossessive best friends with weird lesbian energy.

51
00:03:24,043 --> 00:03:24,989
And Haley.

52
00:03:25,501 --> 00:03:27,296
Play us or trade us.

53
00:03:27,402 --> 00:03:28,949
What are you babbling about?

54
00:03:29,038 --> 00:03:30,109
The boy draft.

55
00:03:30,197 --> 00:03:33,473
We know all you girls got together and drafted us to be your little love dolls,

56
00:03:33,548 --> 00:03:35,947
so we just want to know the results.

57
00:03:36,034 --> 00:03:38,374
It was a fantasy draft, Dim.

58
00:03:38,465 --> 00:03:41,994
You know, like the fantasies you have about Nathan -- not real.

59
00:03:42,095 --> 00:03:43,324
What'd you have in mind?

60
00:03:43,425 --> 00:03:46,027
Dates. Tonight. You pay.

61
00:03:46,402 --> 00:03:48,451
- Look --
- Okay, sounds good.

62
00:03:48,869 --> 00:03:50,067
Sweet.

63
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,442
I'm gonna go get Skills.

64
00:03:51,994 --> 00:03:53,299
So, who picked me?

65
00:03:53,813 --> 00:03:54,853
Come on.

66
00:03:54,948 --> 00:03:56,775
Who wants some Tim?

67
00:03:57,075 --> 00:03:58,417
Is it you, Brooke?

68
00:03:58,809 --> 00:04:01,550
You didn't even get drafted, you little...

69
00:04:02,776 --> 00:04:03,662
Tim.

70
00:04:09,854 --> 00:04:12,255
Hey. Are you okay with this?

71
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:15,405
Yeah. Sure. Why not? I mean, it's a group thing, right?

72
00:04:15,653 --> 00:04:17,713
Yeah. Yeah. Sure. Okay.

73
00:04:17,798 --> 00:04:20,760
Um, you want to come by at like 8:00?

74
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:21,832
Okay.

75
00:04:22,249 --> 00:04:23,229
Okay.

76
00:04:27,474 --> 00:04:28,306
Hey, Brooke.

77
00:04:29,614 --> 00:04:31,094
Hey, look who it is.

78
00:04:31,173 --> 00:04:32,438
So, what time should I be ready?

79
00:04:32,526 --> 00:04:33,614
Um...

80
00:04:33,874 --> 00:04:36,366
you know, it's the craziest thing.

81
00:04:36,652 --> 00:04:40,063
I sort of got mixed up and didn't pick you.

82
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:41,367
What?

83
00:04:41,466 --> 00:04:43,651
It was all Rachel's fault. She tricked me.

84
00:04:43,815 --> 00:04:45,834
So, let me get this straight.

85
00:04:45,938 --> 00:04:48,258
You could have picked me, but you didn't?

86
00:04:48,348 --> 00:04:50,606
It just sort of happened wrong.

87
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:52,071
She picked Chris Keller,

88
00:04:52,952 --> 00:04:54,729
and I picked you.

89
00:04:55,965 --> 00:04:59,196
Well, at least somebody wanted me.

90
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:01,689
No.

91
00:05:07,683 --> 00:05:08,840
Hey,  boyfriend.

92
00:05:09,232 --> 00:05:11,948
Looks like we're supposed to go on a date tonight.

93
00:05:12,296 --> 00:05:15,242
I know you were just doing me a favor when you drafted me, Peyton.

94
00:05:15,327 --> 00:05:17,508
But there's something I have to do tonight.

95
00:05:17,581 --> 00:05:19,596
You're a tough guy to ask out, Mouth.

96
00:05:20,103 --> 00:05:23,039
Well, you could come if you want.

97
00:05:23,452 --> 00:05:26,496
It's just kind of uncool.

98
00:05:26,612 --> 00:05:30,602
Okay, trust me, I've had enough supposedly cool nights.

99
00:05:30,712 --> 00:05:33,041
Uncool sounds great.

100
00:05:33,505 --> 00:05:36,329
Okay. Uncool it is.

101
00:05:42,570 --> 00:05:45,071
I can't believe I didn't even get drafted.

102
00:05:52,398 --> 00:05:56,849
So, Dan put up another campaign billboard over the highway just outside of town.

103
00:05:56,944 --> 00:05:58,618
Yeah, I know. I saw.

104
00:05:58,912 --> 00:06:02,369
But if he's gonna buy the election, there's really nothing I can do about it.

105
00:06:02,477 --> 00:06:04,619
Actually, there is.

106
00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:10,704
Have I ever told you how ridiculous Dan looks with a moustache?

107
00:06:18,408 --> 00:06:19,390
What do you think?

108
00:06:19,507 --> 00:06:22,239
The same thing I thought 10 seconds ago -- you look great.

109
00:06:22,341 --> 00:06:24,020
Okay, well, I'm sorry if I'm a little nervous.

110
00:06:24,102 --> 00:06:26,878
I just have the perfect evening planned for Nathan and me.

111
00:06:27,157 --> 00:06:29,383
I cannot believe you're not going on your date, by the way.

112
00:06:29,459 --> 00:06:30,670
Why should I?

113
00:06:30,764 --> 00:06:33,519
Hmm. I don't know. You can pick between this whole thing was your idea

114
00:06:33,605 --> 00:06:36,751
or because you physically threatened every person that didn't follow the rules.

115
00:06:38,347 --> 00:06:41,346
Oh, shoot. That's Nathan. I'm not ready. Where are my shoes?!

116
00:06:41,423 --> 00:06:42,701
On your feet.

117
00:06:43,158 --> 00:06:45,254
Relax. I'll get it.

118
00:06:45,529 --> 00:06:47,099
To finish our conversation --

119
00:06:47,189 --> 00:06:53,626
I  would rather tongue kiss a pus-infected sore than ever go out with Chris --

120
00:06:54,842 --> 00:06:56,182
Well, well.

121
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:58,614
My date's already dressed for bed.

122
00:06:59,212 --> 00:07:02,137
Looks like someone's a little horny for some Chris Keller.

123
00:07:09,179 --> 00:07:11,162
Hey, Rachel, come on in.

124
00:07:11,452 --> 00:07:12,339
Thanks.

125
00:07:12,507 --> 00:07:13,392
You ready?

126
00:07:13,643 --> 00:07:17,866
Uh, actually, if it's cool with you, I was gonna go see Brooke.

127
00:07:19,087 --> 00:07:20,003
Luke...

128
00:07:20,827 --> 00:07:23,796
you know I was messing with Brooke when I drafted you, right?

129
00:07:24,146 --> 00:07:27,144
And anyway, doesn't she have a date with Chris Keller?

130
00:07:27,292 --> 00:07:28,898
No. She wouldn't do that.

131
00:07:29,054 --> 00:07:30,111
I don't know.

132
00:07:30,201 --> 00:07:31,331
I've seen the guy.

133
00:07:31,412 --> 00:07:32,730
He's kind of fine.

134
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:35,171
Yeah. He's kind of a jerk, too.

135
00:07:35,382 --> 00:07:39,543
Interesting... and definitely my type.

136
00:07:40,258 --> 00:07:43,787
Well, I was gonna say we could get a workout in at the river court,

137
00:07:44,102 --> 00:07:47,663
but instead, let's go to Brooke's house, and I'll officially trade you.

138
00:07:47,995 --> 00:07:49,061
You'd do that?

139
00:07:49,755 --> 00:07:50,809
You'd trade me?

140
00:07:50,894 --> 00:07:51,836
Yeah. Why not?

141
00:07:51,906 --> 00:07:53,602
I can't torture Brooke forever.

142
00:07:54,299 --> 00:07:56,728
Well, I could, but where's the fun in that?

143
00:07:57,750 --> 00:07:58,764
Come on.

144
00:08:01,461 --> 00:08:04,329
Look, whatever you heard, you heard wrong.

145
00:08:04,411 --> 00:08:05,437
So, you're not into me?

146
00:08:05,536 --> 00:08:06,438
No!

147
00:08:06,526 --> 00:08:08,584
Wait, so you and Haley aren't going on dates.

148
00:08:08,922 --> 00:08:09,962
No.

149
00:08:12,026 --> 00:08:13,483
Oh, hey...

150
00:08:13,585 --> 00:08:16,313
Nate. Here for your date?

151
00:08:16,481 --> 00:08:17,873
Yeah. What's it to you?

152
00:08:18,648 --> 00:08:20,101
Haley!

153
00:08:20,383 --> 00:08:22,773
Your boyfriends are here.

154
00:08:24,998 --> 00:08:25,908
Hi.

155
00:08:27,010 --> 00:08:30,058
- Wow. You look so... 
- Overdressed.

156
00:08:31,242 --> 00:08:32,115
So, you girls ready?

157
00:08:32,201 --> 00:08:33,791
I'm not going anywhere with you.

158
00:08:33,894 --> 00:08:35,834
Fine by me. I'm good staying in.

159
00:08:35,926 --> 00:08:38,258
Well, we're going out. Let me just get my purse.

160
00:08:38,574 --> 00:08:40,896
Actually, um, maybe Brooke's right.

161
00:08:40,988 --> 00:08:44,520
I mean, if she's not gonna follow through with this, what are the odds anyone else is?

162
00:08:46,398 --> 00:08:49,634
Could you just, um... just one second.

163
00:08:49,723 --> 00:08:50,501
Ow.

164
00:08:51,615 --> 00:08:52,203
That hurts.

165
00:08:52,266 --> 00:08:56,296
Okay, listen, sister, I joined cheerleading, and I stayed in this stupid draft because of who?

166
00:08:56,343 --> 00:08:57,141
You.

167
00:08:57,210 --> 00:09:00,509
I am this close to getting an actual date with Nathan, so if you don't suck it up

168
00:09:00,522 --> 00:09:03,381
and go out with Chris Keller, the only pus-infected sores

169
00:09:03,459 --> 00:09:06,231
you're gonna be licking are your own when I get through with you.

170
00:09:06,314 --> 00:09:08,942
Okay, great. We're going.

171
00:09:10,283 --> 00:09:10,926
Well.

172
00:09:24,332 --> 00:09:26,904
Yeah. Brooke's definitely staying home tonight.

173
00:09:27,530 --> 00:09:28,844
It's Chris Keller, right?

174
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,825
How about we get some beer before that workout?

175
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:33,629
Now you're talking.

176
00:09:33,797 --> 00:09:34,710
Let's go.

177
00:09:43,042 --> 00:09:45,330
First-round draft pick reporting for duty.

178
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:46,878
Hey, Skills. Come on in.

179
00:09:47,389 --> 00:09:48,716
Oh, yeah.

180
00:09:49,126 --> 00:09:50,020
This'll do.

181
00:09:50,843 --> 00:09:52,398
My parents are out of town for the night.

182
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:56,966
So I was thinking we'd stay in and watch a movie,

183
00:09:57,053 --> 00:09:58,600
maybe  have a couple drinks.

184
00:09:58,726 --> 00:09:59,919
Is that okay?

185
00:10:00,091 --> 00:10:01,368
Okay?

186
00:10:01,711 --> 00:10:03,542
It's better than okay, ma.

187
00:10:03,652 --> 00:10:04,912
This is perfect.

188
00:10:04,992 --> 00:10:05,932
Thanks.

189
00:10:06,366 --> 00:10:10,400
So, anyways, I was thinking we could watch "The Notebook."

190
00:10:11,246 --> 00:10:15,898
How about I just watch you, and you can watch whatever it's called.

191
00:10:15,983 --> 00:10:16,928
"The Notebook."

192
00:10:17,082 --> 00:10:20,704
Oh, my god. You haven't seen it? It's only, like, the best movie ever.

193
00:10:20,792 --> 00:10:21,796
Trust me.

194
00:10:22,605 --> 00:10:25,035
A'ight. Whatever you say, Devin.

195
00:10:25,431 --> 00:10:26,165
Bevin.

196
00:10:26,548 --> 00:10:28,847
Yeah. Yeah, that, too.

197
00:10:29,955 --> 00:10:32,821
I've got to hand it to you, Mouth. I've been on some kinky dates before,

198
00:10:32,889 --> 00:10:35,522
but no one has ever brought me to an old folks' home.

199
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,299
You've been on kinky dates?

200
00:10:37,372 --> 00:10:40,225
Okay. Not the point. What are we doing here?

201
00:10:40,307 --> 00:10:41,941
This is the thing I had to do.

202
00:10:42,016 --> 00:10:44,155
I come once a week, and I read to Mel.

203
00:10:45,306 --> 00:10:46,697
Wait. Who's Mel?

204
00:10:47,791 --> 00:10:50,429
All right. I'll just, uh...

205
00:10:50,522 --> 00:10:52,808
First time I met Ron, when he asked me...

206
00:10:52,892 --> 00:10:53,769
Hey, Mel.

207
00:10:54,601 --> 00:10:56,141
Oh, hi, Joe.

208
00:10:56,979 --> 00:11:00,162
No, it's me -- Marvin, Mouth.

209
00:11:00,398 --> 00:11:03,796
Oh, sure. Mouse. Come in!

210
00:11:04,131 --> 00:11:06,043
I brought you the sports page.

211
00:11:09,567 --> 00:11:12,836
Well, what do we have here?

212
00:11:12,933 --> 00:11:15,473
Um, we have a Peyton. Hi.

213
00:11:15,555 --> 00:11:17,863
Peyton. That's a pretty name.

214
00:11:17,954 --> 00:11:20,073
Well, you're not so bad yourself.

215
00:11:20,146 --> 00:11:21,915
Come in. Sit down. Sit down.

216
00:11:24,065 --> 00:11:27,342
Thank you. You've got a really great place here.

217
00:11:27,434 --> 00:11:31,003
Oh,  not really. It smells like old people.

218
00:11:32,112 --> 00:11:33,632
Take a look at this.

219
00:11:36,618 --> 00:11:39,278
Did I ever tell you that I used to race cars?

220
00:11:39,353 --> 00:11:42,949
Well... you were a handsome devil.

221
00:11:43,045 --> 00:11:44,845
They called me Fireball.

222
00:11:45,018 --> 00:11:47,134
I was kind of fast with the ladies.

223
00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:51,528
I've got some more pictures around here somewhere.

224
00:11:51,535 --> 00:11:52,460
Okay.

225
00:11:52,830 --> 00:11:53,757
All right.

226
00:11:54,474 --> 00:11:55,877
I have an idea.

227
00:11:56,085 --> 00:11:57,231
Let's spring him.

228
00:11:57,619 --> 00:11:58,268
What?

229
00:11:58,358 --> 00:12:00,958
Just for the night. This place is depressing, Mouth.

230
00:12:01,039 --> 00:12:01,903
Peyton, we can't.

231
00:12:01,992 --> 00:12:03,453
Hey, Fireball.

232
00:12:03,592 --> 00:12:07,049
How  would you like to do a little driving with us tonight?

233
00:12:07,968 --> 00:12:12,208
Oh, young lady, I'd rob a bank for you if you asked me nicely.

234
00:12:12,544 --> 00:12:15,719
Come on, Mouth. It's just a couple hours. What harm could it do?

235
00:12:15,799 --> 00:12:18,029
I don't know, Peyton. A lot.

236
00:12:18,527 --> 00:12:24,054
Joey, if you blow this for me, I'm gonna beat you to death with this helmet, okay?

237
00:12:24,165 --> 00:12:26,347
Okay. Let's go.

238
00:12:26,450 --> 00:12:27,718
Ladies first.

239
00:12:33,651 --> 00:12:36,044
Am I the only one that doesn't get the whole beach thing?

240
00:12:36,133 --> 00:12:38,450
It's the beach. What is there to get?

241
00:12:38,564 --> 00:12:40,540
Yeah, but it's such a big tease.

242
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:42,618
I mean, think about it. Girls strip down.

243
00:12:42,719 --> 00:12:45,990
Sometimes they go topless, but never nude.

244
00:12:46,077 --> 00:12:49,253
You can't touch them. It's like a strip club. Hey, baby.

245
00:12:54,164 --> 00:12:56,508
So, um, so, what are we doing here anyway?

246
00:12:56,712 --> 00:12:58,075
This is where we got married.

247
00:12:58,163 --> 00:12:59,458
I thought we'd be alone.

248
00:12:59,598 --> 00:13:01,394
You guys got married here?

249
00:13:01,495 --> 00:13:04,113
It wasn't exactly here. It was just over this ridge.

250
00:13:04,213 --> 00:13:05,995
It's so beautiful.

251
00:13:07,330 --> 00:13:10,799
I'm telling you. It's completely untouched. It's like...

252
00:13:11,677 --> 00:13:12,855
paradise.

253
00:13:17,413 --> 00:13:18,757
It's gone.

254
00:13:21,042 --> 00:13:22,319
Paradise gone.

255
00:13:22,531 --> 00:13:24,015
Seems appropriate.

256
00:13:24,447 --> 00:13:29,159
There were all these little purple wildflowers and trees.

257
00:13:30,302 --> 00:13:32,394
It's okay. Come on.

258
00:13:32,993 --> 00:13:34,598
Let's just go to the mall.

259
00:13:52,910 --> 00:13:53,888
Ready?

260
00:13:54,128 --> 00:13:56,194
Deb, I don't think we should. What if we get caught?

261
00:13:56,264 --> 00:13:58,686
Karen, quit being so responsible.

262
00:13:58,783 --> 00:14:00,963
I can't help it. That's who I am.

263
00:14:01,058 --> 00:14:03,567
Oh, well, not according to Dan's campaign commercial.

264
00:14:03,635 --> 00:14:05,934
You know, the one that makes you look psychotic?

265
00:14:06,279 --> 00:14:07,963
Besides, it's harmless fun.

266
00:14:08,053 --> 00:14:10,561
We'll paint a moustache on him, some black teeth.

267
00:14:10,852 --> 00:14:12,628
You said you wanted to do this.

268
00:14:12,774 --> 00:14:13,665
Yeah.

269
00:14:13,752 --> 00:14:17,798
That's when I was stuck in construction traffic staring at his fat face.

270
00:14:19,151 --> 00:14:20,322
Now I'm chicken.

271
00:14:20,995 --> 00:14:23,340
Fine, but I'm going up,

272
00:14:23,427 --> 00:14:26,563
and tomorrow when you're stuck in traffic, you're gonna wish you'd joined me.

273
00:14:27,788 --> 00:14:28,757
Fine.

274
00:14:32,007 --> 00:14:33,895
I can't believe I'm doing this.

275
00:14:34,566 --> 00:14:36,405
I can't believe she's doing this.

276
00:14:38,149 --> 00:14:39,993
So, she's on a date with Chris.

277
00:14:40,105 --> 00:14:41,642
It doesn't mean anything.

278
00:14:41,715 --> 00:14:42,934
No, it does.

279
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:46,149
This guy's caused a lot of trouble. Brooke knows that.

280
00:14:47,051 --> 00:14:50,249
Okay, so, what is the deal with you and Brooke anyway?

281
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:52,974
She's just not ready to commit.

282
00:14:53,064 --> 00:14:53,972
Right.

283
00:14:54,081 --> 00:14:57,193
That's usually what I tell guys I'm not really into.

284
00:14:57,586 --> 00:15:00,900
And she wants to make sure I'm serious about her. You know, plus --

285
00:15:00,978 --> 00:15:02,391
Plus what?

286
00:15:02,970 --> 00:15:04,373
She's the one.

287
00:15:04,510 --> 00:15:05,591
Why?

288
00:15:06,961 --> 00:15:08,283
She just is.

289
00:15:08,909 --> 00:15:09,858
I feel it.

290
00:15:09,961 --> 00:15:14,622
Pascal says, "the heart has reasons that reason cannot know."

291
00:15:14,711 --> 00:15:17,320
What did Pascal say about Chris Keller?

292
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:22,305
Sorry. Cheap shot.

293
00:15:22,893 --> 00:15:25,938
Okay, here's the game.

294
00:15:26,236 --> 00:15:28,508
You miss a shot, and you drink.

295
00:15:28,714 --> 00:15:30,027
You make a shot...

296
00:15:33,175 --> 00:15:34,272
I drink.

297
00:15:35,259 --> 00:15:36,906
Okay, this was a bad idea.

298
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:39,142
This was a bad idea.

299
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:41,796
Oh, quit complaining and grow a pair.

300
00:15:41,872 --> 00:15:43,158
You ready, Mel?

301
00:15:43,247 --> 00:15:45,806
That's fireball to you, Trixie.

302
00:15:50,516 --> 00:15:51,954
Here we go!

303
00:16:05,016 --> 00:16:06,954
You want some of this?

304
00:16:09,614 --> 00:16:11,492
Mel, be careful.

305
00:16:12,705 --> 00:16:13,712
Hey!

306
00:16:23,724 --> 00:16:25,183
Are you gonna watch the movie?

307
00:16:25,858 --> 00:16:28,414
I would, but I can't stop watching you.

308
00:16:30,015 --> 00:16:31,131
Okay, here.

309
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:37,875
There's more of that if you watch the movie.

310
00:16:39,799 --> 00:16:40,742
Okay.

311
00:16:43,497 --> 00:16:45,585
Let's watch this damn movie, then.

312
00:16:52,504 --> 00:16:54,190
All right. Go ahead. Hurry up.

313
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,400
Go do it, and let's get out of here.

314
00:16:55,416 --> 00:16:56,910
- Go. Go. Go.
- Okay.

315
00:16:57,236 --> 00:16:59,657
Um, okay, you do it.

316
00:16:59,803 --> 00:17:01,802
No. You said you would do it.

317
00:17:01,881 --> 00:17:02,768
Okay.

318
00:17:21,791 --> 00:17:23,478
You do the moustache. Go.

319
00:17:43,636 --> 00:17:45,792
Not exactly the magical night you had planned?

320
00:17:45,878 --> 00:17:49,233
No. I wouldn't say that -- crowded mall and Nathan ignoring me,

321
00:17:50,092 --> 00:17:53,009
Chris Keller stealing change out of the fountain.

322
00:17:54,346 --> 00:17:58,428
My night with Nathan was supposed to be a dream come true, not this nightmare.

323
00:17:59,438 --> 00:18:02,165
Well, keep the dream alive, sister.

324
00:18:02,245 --> 00:18:03,418
I'll talk to Nathan.

325
00:18:12,613 --> 00:18:14,463
Okay, 2-part question, Nate --

326
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:18,138
"A" -- why the hell haven't you beaten the stuffing out of Chris Keller yet so I can go home?

327
00:18:18,219 --> 00:18:22,226
And "B" -- if you were just gonna ignore Haley all night, why did you come?

328
00:18:22,777 --> 00:18:25,004
Haley still loves you.

329
00:18:25,091 --> 00:18:27,070
All you have to do is take her back.

330
00:18:27,147 --> 00:18:29,372
Right. Kind of like with you and Lucas.

331
00:18:31,059 --> 00:18:33,217
You see, it's not so easy getting back in the ring,

332
00:18:33,281 --> 00:18:36,209
especially with the one that knocked you out in the first place.

333
00:18:40,075 --> 00:18:43,065
Well, well, Haley James.

334
00:18:48,775 --> 00:18:50,197
What'd you wish for?

335
00:18:50,419 --> 00:18:52,488
That Nathan would bludge on you.

336
00:18:52,826 --> 00:18:55,713
Brooke and I were actually kind of wondering why he hasn't already.

337
00:18:55,778 --> 00:18:57,447
Maybe he's afraid of me.

338
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:02,596
Or... or maybe he doesn't care anymore.

339
00:19:02,676 --> 00:19:03,549
Let's find out.

340
00:19:03,643 --> 00:19:04,597
Hey. Stop it.

341
00:19:05,044 --> 00:19:07,678
Come on. Either he gets jealous or me, you, and Brooke have a threesome.

342
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:09,257
Either way, it's win-win for you.

343
00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:11,103
Chris, seriously, don't.

344
00:19:11,543 --> 00:19:12,983
What the hell is this?

345
00:19:14,593 --> 00:19:16,261
Oh, well, good news for you. Bad news for me.

346
00:19:16,342 --> 00:19:18,007
I told him not to.

347
00:19:18,073 --> 00:19:19,319
You better back off, Keller.

348
00:19:19,396 --> 00:19:21,317
Hey, I just thought someone should be nice to her tonight.

349
00:19:21,391 --> 00:19:22,191
Oh yeah ?

350
00:19:22,267 --> 00:19:24,481
Haley, what are you doing? Are you crazy?

351
00:19:24,770 --> 00:19:28,253
Nathan is vulnerable, and you were practically giving the enemy a lap dance.

352
00:19:28,341 --> 00:19:29,741
I didn't do anything!

353
00:19:29,834 --> 00:19:32,101
You mean besides kiss Chris and run away with him?

354
00:19:32,449 --> 00:19:33,790
You know, I'm out of here.

355
00:19:33,881 --> 00:19:37,369
This whole thing has gotten way beyond the point of bizarro!

356
00:19:37,533 --> 00:19:39,849
Oh, you mean bizarro like messing with Lucas

357
00:19:39,922 --> 00:19:41,912
and then hiding all those letters under your bed?

358
00:19:41,988 --> 00:19:43,516
Hey, check it out -- catfight.

359
00:19:43,598 --> 00:19:46,437
What were you doing snooping through my things?!

360
00:19:46,518 --> 00:19:47,787
I wasn't snooping through your things.

361
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:51,650
I bumped into them when I was trying to maximize on the 2 feet of storage space

362
00:19:51,708 --> 00:19:53,892
that you so generously offered to me.

363
00:19:53,969 --> 00:19:55,864
Oh, you know what? I'm done.

364
00:19:58,149 --> 00:19:59,397
Brooke, wait.

365
00:19:59,670 --> 00:20:02,070
There is no way that you get to waltz out of here

366
00:20:02,141 --> 00:20:04,734
when this whole stupid night was your idea.

367
00:20:04,806 --> 00:20:06,557
- Brooke, don't go.
- Come here, Keller.

368
00:20:06,639 --> 00:20:08,897
-  I am not through with you.
- Well, I'm through with you.

369
00:20:08,970 --> 00:20:10,346
The night's still young.

370
00:20:10,428 --> 00:20:12,243
The night's gonna be over if you touch Haley again.

371
00:20:12,321 --> 00:20:13,626
Oh, my god.

372
00:20:14,068 --> 00:20:14,896
What?

373
00:20:15,199 --> 00:20:16,436
My clothes.

374
00:20:16,531 --> 00:20:18,768
Have you not spent enough rent money for tonight, Brooke?

375
00:20:18,842 --> 00:20:22,362
No. These are my designs, my sketches.

376
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:26,061
They told me draw up some things. They said they liked them, but I guess --

377
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:28,186
I just never dreamed...

378
00:20:29,192 --> 00:20:31,276
You guys, I'm in the window.

379
00:20:31,825 --> 00:20:33,774
Okay, how cool is this?

380
00:20:33,856 --> 00:20:35,890
Now we have to celebrate,right?

381
00:20:44,865 --> 00:20:46,504
No doubt about it.

382
00:20:47,966 --> 00:20:49,187
We're stuck.

383
00:20:49,475 --> 00:20:55,006
Well, he's probably gonna ground me, but I'll call Lucas on the phone...

384
00:20:57,096 --> 00:21:00,902
...which I left next to yours in the car.

385
00:21:00,916 --> 00:21:02,388
Oh, no!

386
00:21:05,466 --> 00:21:06,793
Help!

387
00:21:07,387 --> 00:21:08,944
- Deb, Deb!
- Help!

388
00:21:09,023 --> 00:21:10,175
Deb, you cannot do that.

389
00:21:10,255 --> 00:21:11,673
Why not? We're stuck.

390
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,348
Because we're gonna look like a couple of jackholes,

391
00:21:13,425 --> 00:21:15,776
and Dan will win the election for sure.

392
00:21:16,295 --> 00:21:19,244
Besides, they've closed the highway at night because of the construction,

393
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:20,829
so no one's gonna hear you.

394
00:21:22,178 --> 00:21:24,046
I'm sorry, Karen.

395
00:21:25,569 --> 00:21:27,023
This is my fault.

396
00:21:29,642 --> 00:21:30,683
No, look...

397
00:21:32,186 --> 00:21:33,487
I wanted to come.

398
00:21:33,635 --> 00:21:36,157
No, I mean all of it.

399
00:21:36,484 --> 00:21:39,266
I never should have agreed to stay with Dan during this race.

400
00:21:39,349 --> 00:21:44,494
I just -- I wanted so badly to believe that he'd actually leave Nathan alone,

401
00:21:45,027 --> 00:21:48,236
even though I know it's probably a lie.

402
00:21:48,915 --> 00:21:50,645
Gotta get out of that house, Deb.

403
00:21:50,674 --> 00:21:51,751
I know.

404
00:21:52,549 --> 00:21:55,849
Guess I'm just afraid to be on my own.

405
00:21:55,937 --> 00:21:57,747
I've always been that way.

406
00:21:58,332 --> 00:22:00,388
You're not gonna be alone, Deb.

407
00:22:01,126 --> 00:22:02,688
You're gonna be independent,

408
00:22:02,777 --> 00:22:07,278
and although you might not see it in yourself, I see that strength in you every day.

409
00:22:12,178 --> 00:22:13,306
Thanks.

410
00:22:15,214 --> 00:22:16,650
Stupid ladder.

411
00:22:19,975 --> 00:22:22,626
Okay, I've got an idea. Come on.

412
00:22:22,941 --> 00:22:24,165
We're getting down.

413
00:22:24,285 --> 00:22:25,274
How?

414
00:22:28,064 --> 00:22:29,355
Take off your clothes.

415
00:22:38,944 --> 00:22:40,657
You're a good guy, Mouth.

416
00:22:40,748 --> 00:22:42,863
It's really nice of you to spend time with Mel.

417
00:22:42,952 --> 00:22:44,371
It says a lot about you.

418
00:22:44,458 --> 00:22:46,535
I bet you're gonna have it all some day.

419
00:22:46,641 --> 00:22:48,964
Yeah, I'm thinking of running for senator.

420
00:22:49,743 --> 00:22:52,712
I got the idea from Brooke, sort of.

421
00:22:53,097 --> 00:22:54,989
Well, Fireball's on a tear.

422
00:22:55,079 --> 00:22:57,464
I bet this is a nigh the won't forget for a while.

423
00:22:57,811 --> 00:23:00,851
Actually, he probably won't remember it.

424
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:04,008
Mel has alzheimer's disease, Peyton.

425
00:23:05,410 --> 00:23:08,160
He's forgotten huge parts of his life.

426
00:23:08,333 --> 00:23:12,228
He was married for 50 years, but he doesn't remember it.

427
00:23:12,596 --> 00:23:17,037
His mind just opened up over time and everything slipped away --

428
00:23:17,536 --> 00:23:20,615
the woman he loved, the house he lived in...

429
00:23:20,704 --> 00:23:22,094
His youth.

430
00:23:30,328 --> 00:23:32,213
We should probably take him back.

431
00:23:39,779 --> 00:23:42,979
Wait, he's building that house, and he don't even know if she coming back?

432
00:23:48,107 --> 00:23:49,802
Wait, wait, wait.

433
00:23:50,521 --> 00:23:51,784
I'm gonna get a drink.

434
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:59,276
Yeah, you write those letters, dog.

435
00:23:59,371 --> 00:24:00,338
Write them.

436
00:24:01,161 --> 00:24:04,081
So, what about the letters to Lucas?

437
00:24:04,575 --> 00:24:06,691
Are we talking about me or celebrating me?

438
00:24:06,778 --> 00:24:08,979
Oh, no, we are definitely celebrating you.

439
00:24:09,072 --> 00:24:10,375
To your sketches.

440
00:24:10,466 --> 00:24:12,401
We already drank to that like 20 times.

441
00:24:12,503 --> 00:24:15,824
No, we drank to your designs like 20 times.

442
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,577
Then we drank to your clothes.

443
00:24:17,667 --> 00:24:19,113
Now we're drinking to your sketches.

444
00:24:19,206 --> 00:24:21,011
In the window -- totally yours.

445
00:24:21,724 --> 00:24:23,193
To my sketches.

446
00:24:27,481 --> 00:24:28,953
Any meteors up there?

447
00:24:30,463 --> 00:24:32,825
That was a great night. Remember that?

448
00:24:32,877 --> 00:24:34,743
Watching the meteor shower together.

449
00:24:36,748 --> 00:24:38,729
You look nice tonight, Haley.

450
00:24:38,851 --> 00:24:40,030
Thanks.

451
00:24:41,269 --> 00:24:44,465
I just wish we could have spent some more time together without all this.

452
00:24:44,562 --> 00:24:46,051
Chris and Brooke?

453
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:49,103
I mean the beach, this balcony.

454
00:24:49,867 --> 00:24:51,766
I haven't forgotten about our past, Haley.

455
00:24:51,858 --> 00:24:53,680
I know where we got married.

456
00:24:53,765 --> 00:24:56,298
I know this is where we made love in the rain.

457
00:24:56,689 --> 00:24:59,262
I still feel our past, just like you do.

458
00:25:00,237 --> 00:25:03,527
I just thought it might be nice to hang out in the present for a night.

459
00:25:10,403 --> 00:25:11,370
What are you thinking?

460
00:25:13,982 --> 00:25:15,098
Nothing.

461
00:25:16,986 --> 00:25:18,768
Just praying for rain.

462
00:25:25,387 --> 00:25:27,712
Well, that's the last of it.

463
00:25:27,815 --> 00:25:29,209
Nice shooting, Tex.

464
00:25:29,402 --> 00:25:30,963
So, are we gonna call it a night?

465
00:25:31,079 --> 00:25:32,581
Or we could play a new game.

466
00:25:32,909 --> 00:25:34,601
How about strip basketball?

467
00:25:34,767 --> 00:25:38,965
You know, I always figured if I met the devil, that she'd be hot and holding a basketball.

468
00:25:40,805 --> 00:25:42,354
But I'm gonna pass.

469
00:25:42,547 --> 00:25:43,711
Because of Brooke...

470
00:25:43,881 --> 00:25:45,228
who's on a date?

471
00:25:46,263 --> 00:25:47,288
Okay.

472
00:25:47,601 --> 00:25:49,072
Take your shirt off.

473
00:25:50,412 --> 00:25:51,024
Rachel.

474
00:25:51,127 --> 00:25:53,543
I'm not gonna touch you, you sissy virgin boy.

475
00:25:53,633 --> 00:25:55,634
I'm trying to make a point. Take your shirt off.

476
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:05,014
All right, you say Brooke's the one...

477
00:26:05,975 --> 00:26:07,199
your soul mate.

478
00:26:08,522 --> 00:26:10,808
Well, if that's the case,

479
00:26:11,345 --> 00:26:15,662
call upon destiny or providence

480
00:26:15,932 --> 00:26:19,166
or whatever forces are gonna bring you two together

481
00:26:19,937 --> 00:26:21,498
and make the shot...

482
00:26:22,005 --> 00:26:23,206
blindfolded.

483
00:26:30,210 --> 00:26:31,608
This is ridiculous.

484
00:26:31,946 --> 00:26:34,261
Come on. It's your destiny.

485
00:26:34,351 --> 00:26:35,691
You can't miss.

486
00:26:36,527 --> 00:26:38,115
Okay. Can you see me?

487
00:26:38,211 --> 00:26:39,179
No.

488
00:26:45,381 --> 00:26:47,549
Okay. I trust you.

489
00:26:48,408 --> 00:26:49,866
Now follow my voice.

490
00:26:50,239 --> 00:26:53,199
If Brooke's the one, make the shot.

491
00:27:03,879 --> 00:27:04,954
What happened?

492
00:27:06,109 --> 00:27:07,149
It went in.

493
00:27:10,779 --> 00:27:11,957
Nice shot.

494
00:27:15,235 --> 00:27:16,418
Make it, take it.

495
00:27:29,543 --> 00:27:31,272
Get yourself dressed, Rachel.

496
00:27:31,767 --> 00:27:33,913
Okay, that's the second time this month you've said that to me.

497
00:27:33,987 --> 00:27:35,277
You're gonna give me a complex.

498
00:27:35,366 --> 00:27:38,836
Come on. Why sell yourself short like this, huh?

499
00:27:38,941 --> 00:27:40,758
You guys are unbelievable.

500
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:42,709
We don't give it up, you pressure us.

501
00:27:42,807 --> 00:27:47,185
We do give it up, and we have self-image problems or we're sluts.

502
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:52,008
You know, at my last school, we had names for guys like you, Luke --

503
00:27:52,606 --> 00:27:53,695
"gay."

504
00:27:55,768 --> 00:28:00,394
I mean, non-exclusive dating is a dream come true for most boys,

505
00:28:00,510 --> 00:28:02,872
so what's with the dorks of Tree Hill?

506
00:28:03,364 --> 00:28:06,877
Every guy is tragically hung up on somebody.

507
00:28:07,128 --> 00:28:09,000
It makes it kind of hard for a girl.

508
00:28:11,018 --> 00:28:12,841
Not if she's the girl.

509
00:28:14,910 --> 00:28:18,898
Lucas is the one for me.

510
00:28:19,285 --> 00:28:21,067
Actually, my name is Chris.

511
00:28:21,908 --> 00:28:24,472
No, don't be like that. Come on. Let's have another beer.

512
00:28:24,551 --> 00:28:26,351
To your sketches.

513
00:28:26,451 --> 00:28:29,259
That's a nice try, but you can go now.

514
00:28:29,859 --> 00:28:31,878
Fair enough. It's late.

515
00:28:31,984 --> 00:28:33,865
I'm attractive. It scares you.

516
00:28:33,961 --> 00:28:35,072
Let me use the restroom.

517
00:28:37,405 --> 00:28:40,141
You know, I envy you, Brooke.

518
00:28:40,492 --> 00:28:44,172
Having found someone to trust and confide in like Lucas,

519
00:28:44,261 --> 00:28:46,227
someone that won't take advantage of it.

520
00:28:46,313 --> 00:28:48,171
Sort of like Haley found Nathan.

521
00:28:48,665 --> 00:28:50,777
I'm sure it'll work out for them, too.

522
00:28:55,828 --> 00:28:59,491
I just wanted you to know that I don't blame you for any of this.

523
00:29:01,359 --> 00:29:03,423
You didn't want to get married.

524
00:29:04,364 --> 00:29:08,253
Wa-wa-wait a second. Of course I did.

525
00:29:08,499 --> 00:29:10,218
I was just scared.

526
00:29:10,302 --> 00:29:12,810
Yeah, and I promised you everything would be okay.

527
00:29:12,876 --> 00:29:14,007
I shouldn't have.

528
00:29:15,191 --> 00:29:17,297
I think about it a lot, you know --

529
00:29:17,485 --> 00:29:20,280
how this isn't the life you would have had if I hadn't come along.

530
00:29:20,754 --> 00:29:22,037
It's not the life you should have had.

531
00:29:22,116 --> 00:29:24,113
- It's more. 
- No, it's not.

532
00:29:24,211 --> 00:29:27,809
You'd still have your music. You'd be on tour. You'd probably be a big star by now.

533
00:29:27,922 --> 00:29:29,426
Come on. You're...

534
00:29:32,590 --> 00:29:33,530
Okay.

535
00:29:34,439 --> 00:29:36,730
You know the moment that I left the tour?

536
00:29:37,395 --> 00:29:39,699
We were playing this club in Illinois,

537
00:29:39,823 --> 00:29:44,231
and Chris decides to do a cover of an '80s song called "Missing you."

538
00:29:44,897 --> 00:29:47,054
And everybody starts singing along.

539
00:29:47,137 --> 00:29:50,438
The crowd's loving it, and they turn the house lights up.

540
00:29:51,553 --> 00:29:55,293
And I could see every face out there,

541
00:29:56,725 --> 00:29:59,813
and I fell apart.

542
00:30:00,889 --> 00:30:04,057
Onstage in front of 3,000 people, I lost it.

543
00:30:04,135 --> 00:30:07,473
I couldn't sing. I couldn't hear the music. Nothing.

544
00:30:09,250 --> 00:30:12,654
'Cause that was the moment that I knew

545
00:30:12,751 --> 00:30:16,306
that none of it could ever be enough without you.

546
00:30:16,866 --> 00:30:21,399
All of the celebrity and all of the applause and all the pretty melodies

547
00:30:21,608 --> 00:30:23,980
couldn't fill your void in my heart.

548
00:30:26,362 --> 00:30:29,306
So, I guess you're right.

549
00:30:29,390 --> 00:30:31,299
It's not the life I would have had...

550
00:30:32,410 --> 00:30:36,024
'cause ever since I met you, it has been so much more.

551
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:41,486
There's no chance that, um,

552
00:30:41,584 --> 00:30:44,699
you'd want to go to the last place I had planned for us, is there?

553
00:30:44,964 --> 00:30:46,041
Well, let's see --

554
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:48,861
it's either take my chances with you or hang out with Chris Keller.

555
00:30:48,953 --> 00:30:50,556
Thank you. Let's go.

556
00:30:58,532 --> 00:31:00,175
Did you like the movie, Skills?

557
00:31:01,066 --> 00:31:03,388
There's just so much love.

558
00:31:03,772 --> 00:31:05,824
Just so much love.

559
00:31:07,456 --> 00:31:08,870
It's okay.

560
00:31:09,002 --> 00:31:11,405
That's just the power of "The Notebook."

561
00:31:11,611 --> 00:31:13,654
Do you want me to drive you home?

562
00:31:13,812 --> 00:31:17,903
Or we could go upstairs and make out.

563
00:31:21,067 --> 00:31:23,163
Can we cuddle a little first?

564
00:31:23,312 --> 00:31:24,347
Sure.

565
00:31:29,136 --> 00:31:31,047
All right, here it goes.

566
00:31:33,610 --> 00:31:36,495
Oh, shoot. Just a little short.

567
00:31:37,238 --> 00:31:39,435
Okay. We're gonna need more clothes.

568
00:31:39,512 --> 00:31:41,591
Yeah, well, forget it, Annie Oakley.

569
00:31:41,695 --> 00:31:44,234
I already gave you my jacket and my shoes,

570
00:31:44,316 --> 00:31:48,888
and I made a promise to myself that I would never be naked in front of that man again.

571
00:31:49,823 --> 00:31:51,840
The things I do for you.

572
00:31:51,926 --> 00:31:53,834
Oh, oh. Keep your pants on.

573
00:32:01,536 --> 00:32:04,335
Hey. That's pretty cute.

574
00:32:04,561 --> 00:32:05,460
Where'd you get that?

575
00:32:05,548 --> 00:32:07,654
Oh, didn't I tell you? There was a sale at...

576
00:32:07,905 --> 00:32:09,863
- Would you just tie it on?!
- Oh, okay.

577
00:32:12,937 --> 00:32:14,512
There we go. Come on.

578
00:32:16,295 --> 00:32:17,704
Okay. Ready?

579
00:32:17,795 --> 00:32:19,542
- Come on. 
- And...

580
00:32:22,901 --> 00:32:23,788
Got it!

581
00:32:25,366 --> 00:32:26,757
Easy.

582
00:32:27,242 --> 00:32:28,420
Easy.

583
00:32:31,347 --> 00:32:32,319
Yeah!

584
00:32:33,056 --> 00:32:34,019
All right. Okay.

585
00:32:34,119 --> 00:32:37,980
Get dressed, and I'll gather up all the evidence. Let's get the heck off this thing.

586
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,606
I don't -- I don't want to leave it like this, Deb.

587
00:32:48,684 --> 00:32:51,509
We're better than this, Deb.

588
00:32:51,803 --> 00:32:54,179
I don't want to sink to Dan's level.

589
00:32:54,273 --> 00:32:56,984
You could have said that before we climbed up here.

590
00:32:57,657 --> 00:33:00,061
Yeah, well...

591
00:33:00,242 --> 00:33:01,568
what fun would that have been?

592
00:33:02,329 --> 00:33:05,056
Ugh! God! All right.

593
00:33:20,035 --> 00:33:22,296
Okay, Mel, you're home.

594
00:33:25,747 --> 00:33:27,255
Oh, hey, wait!

595
00:33:27,629 --> 00:33:29,442
Don't forget your helmet, Fireball.

596
00:33:32,266 --> 00:33:33,669
Thank you, sweetheart.

597
00:33:34,949 --> 00:33:36,892
What's your name, anyway?

598
00:33:38,862 --> 00:33:40,373
It's Peyton.

599
00:33:40,646 --> 00:33:41,499
Peyton.

600
00:33:42,386 --> 00:33:43,853
That's a pretty name.

601
00:33:44,795 --> 00:33:47,497
Did I ever tell you I used to race cars?

602
00:33:48,768 --> 00:33:51,578
No. No.You never told me that.

603
00:33:52,601 --> 00:33:54,044
I bet you were great.

604
00:34:09,307 --> 00:34:10,854
Take your time, Joe.

605
00:34:16,277 --> 00:34:17,951
He deserves better.

606
00:34:18,660 --> 00:34:20,083
How long have you known him?

607
00:34:20,857 --> 00:34:22,291
All my life.

608
00:34:22,775 --> 00:34:24,431
He's my grandpa.

609
00:34:24,838 --> 00:34:27,104
He just... doesn't remember.

610
00:34:28,843 --> 00:34:31,173
You know how he's always calling me Joe?

611
00:34:31,827 --> 00:34:33,869
Well, Joe's my dad's name,

612
00:34:34,031 --> 00:34:36,510
but they had a falling out, so

613
00:34:36,846 --> 00:34:38,807
I come to see him instead.

614
00:34:40,489 --> 00:34:42,859
Anyway, I'll be back.

615
00:34:50,426 --> 00:34:52,607
Okay, here we are.

616
00:34:53,083 --> 00:34:56,803
You're probably tired, so I'll see you next week.

617
00:34:57,543 --> 00:34:58,605
Joe...

618
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:06,661
I, uh, I know I made some mistakes with you...

619
00:35:07,818 --> 00:35:11,458
but one day you're gonna have a boy of your own.

620
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:15,439
Make sure he's a good man.

621
00:35:18,331 --> 00:35:19,497
I will.

622
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:25,226
I love you.

623
00:35:27,727 --> 00:35:29,368
I love you, too, son.

624
00:35:48,429 --> 00:35:49,993
- You all set?
- Yeah.

625
00:35:51,363 --> 00:35:53,905
Hey, can I ask you a question?

626
00:35:55,967 --> 00:35:58,944
Why do you keep coming to see him if he's just not gonna remember?

627
00:35:59,429 --> 00:36:01,115
Because I will.

628
00:36:02,026 --> 00:36:05,996
Besides, he probably doesn't have that much time left.

629
00:36:06,206 --> 00:36:07,464
I don't know.

630
00:36:08,071 --> 00:36:09,897
Nobody should die alone.

631
00:36:13,888 --> 00:36:17,094
This bracelet -- it's my birth mother's.

632
00:36:17,185 --> 00:36:19,578
It's a cancer-survivor bracelet,

633
00:36:20,437 --> 00:36:25,451
but I told her I didn't want to see her anymore, and I sent her away.

634
00:36:28,108 --> 00:36:32,169
You know, I know alzheimer's is this terrible disease,

635
00:36:32,591 --> 00:36:35,856
but at least Mel doesn't have to live with his regrets, you know,

636
00:36:35,932 --> 00:36:40,880
and all the mistakes he made, and stuff he wishes he could take back.

637
00:36:41,228 --> 00:36:43,089
Yeah, that's true.

638
00:36:45,251 --> 00:36:47,438
But I say give me regret...

639
00:36:47,771 --> 00:36:50,794
as long as I can keep the good memories, too.

640
00:36:56,188 --> 00:36:58,215
We all have regrets, Peyton,

641
00:36:59,245 --> 00:37:02,226
but some of us still have enough time to erase them.

642
00:37:10,882 --> 00:37:13,136
Thought you were dragging me out here to play miniature golf.

643
00:37:13,224 --> 00:37:13,772
What happened?

644
00:37:13,802 --> 00:37:17,283
No. No, that's gone, kind of like our wedding site.

645
00:37:18,510 --> 00:37:22,030
Yeah. Look, I know tonight wasn't what you wanted it to be, Haley.

646
00:37:22,103 --> 00:37:25,670
No. You were right. I had some unrealistic notions about tonight,

647
00:37:25,750 --> 00:37:30,213
and I think I just -- I had a silly idea that everything would work out perfectly,

648
00:37:30,302 --> 00:37:32,592
and I would end up in your arms, and...

649
00:37:33,335 --> 00:37:37,499
I'm sorry. I guess I just wanted to hear you say that everything was gonna be okay,

650
00:37:37,599 --> 00:37:39,497
even if it was just for one night.

651
00:37:40,366 --> 00:37:41,232
I'm sorry.

652
00:37:41,318 --> 00:37:45,856
Anyway, um, every year Lucas and I come up here,

653
00:37:45,950 --> 00:37:49,066
and we make predictions about what's gonna happen

654
00:37:49,104 --> 00:37:52,652
or what we wish would happen during the next school year.

655
00:37:55,151 --> 00:37:57,807
And I want to show you my prediction.

656
00:37:57,976 --> 00:37:59,019
Don't.

657
00:37:59,524 --> 00:38:03,236
I mean, if you show me, then it won't come true.

658
00:38:03,317 --> 00:38:04,478
It's a wish, right?

659
00:38:04,553 --> 00:38:06,042
Please, Nathan?

660
00:38:07,403 --> 00:38:08,932
Okay. Give it to me.

661
00:38:14,308 --> 00:38:15,216
You got a pen?

662
00:38:15,233 --> 00:38:18,128
Of course I have a pen. I'm tutor girl. Why?

663
00:38:18,242 --> 00:38:19,101
Turn around.

664
00:38:19,194 --> 00:38:20,196
What are you --

665
00:38:20,314 --> 00:38:21,731
I need your back.

666
00:38:22,819 --> 00:38:24,133
Okay.

667
00:38:26,924 --> 00:38:28,347
What -- what are you doing?

668
00:38:29,137 --> 00:38:31,179
I'm writing my own prediction for this year.

669
00:38:32,901 --> 00:38:36,348
A year from now, we'll see.

670
00:38:37,965 --> 00:38:40,857
So, what's to keep me from sneaking up here and reading what you wrote?

671
00:38:41,745 --> 00:38:43,654
Guess I'll just have to trust you.

672
00:38:56,970 --> 00:38:58,157
Brooke's house.

673
00:38:58,949 --> 00:39:01,833
Honestly, Lucas, have I taught you nothing?

674
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:05,527
The end-of-the-night, drunken booty call is the last act of a desperate boy.

675
00:39:05,612 --> 00:39:07,150
It's not a booty call.

676
00:39:07,252 --> 00:39:08,616
It's the opposite of that.

677
00:39:08,728 --> 00:39:10,875
Why? 'Cause she's the one?

678
00:39:11,005 --> 00:39:13,538
Do you realize how screwed up that logic is?

679
00:39:13,619 --> 00:39:14,703
I made the shot.

680
00:39:14,792 --> 00:39:16,547
So you made a lucky shot.

681
00:39:16,647 --> 00:39:20,867
Do you really think there's only one person on this entire planet that's right for you?

682
00:39:21,347 --> 00:39:22,418
I do.

683
00:39:22,555 --> 00:39:24,350
Okay. What about Peyton?

684
00:39:24,460 --> 00:39:27,672
I hear you once had the same feelings for her. Maybe she's the one.

685
00:39:27,892 --> 00:39:32,287
Or being that we're still in high school, maybe you haven't met the one.

686
00:39:32,375 --> 00:39:33,689
But I have.

687
00:39:34,356 --> 00:39:35,827
And she's in that apartment.

688
00:39:50,605 --> 00:39:52,021
Hey, look who it is.

689
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:53,533
How was your date with Bevin?

690
00:39:53,624 --> 00:39:55,936
You guys ever see a movie called "The Notebook"?

691
00:39:58,968 --> 00:40:00,568
She notebooked you?

692
00:40:05,282 --> 00:40:07,320
He was really sweet.

693
00:40:08,043 --> 00:40:09,864
I totally notebooked him.

694
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:30,464
Thanks for tonight.

695
00:40:32,345 --> 00:40:34,188
I know it's a little out of the way.

696
00:40:35,167 --> 00:40:37,754
Um, actually, I promised Lucas that I would meet him afterward

697
00:40:37,818 --> 00:40:41,418
so we could talk about how the dates went and stuff.

698
00:40:41,507 --> 00:40:44,148
Yeah. Yeah, I'll just, uh, take off.

699
00:40:44,849 --> 00:40:45,753
Okay.

700
00:40:47,110 --> 00:40:48,299
Listen, Haley,

701
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:52,419
don't be worried about the beach, our wedding spot.

702
00:40:53,052 --> 00:40:55,096
I know, Nathan. I'm sorry.

703
00:40:55,189 --> 00:40:56,782
I just hate that it's all gone --

704
00:40:56,883 --> 00:40:59,398
the trees and those little purple flowers.

705
00:41:09,471 --> 00:41:11,455
The roots are still there.

706
00:41:13,134 --> 00:41:14,682
It just takes time.

707
00:41:17,625 --> 00:41:19,640
Don't say I never gave you anything.

708
00:42:03,027 --> 00:42:03,882
Brooke?

709
00:42:20,053 --> 00:42:23,167
