1
00:01:59,627 --> 00:02:05,245
Okay folks, this is it. Haley James steps to the line with a flawless 4.0 GPA hanging in the balance.

2
00:02:05,348 --> 00:02:08,047
She’s going to need this free throw to pass Phys-Ed.

3
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:11,557
Otherwise, her perfect grade point average is history.

4
00:02:13,007 --> 00:02:14,125
Come on, Hales. You can do it.

5
00:02:14,237 --> 00:02:15,956
Don’t miss it, tutor girl.

6
00:02:36,448 --> 00:02:37,459
Peyton.

7
00:02:38,499 --> 00:02:40,760
So, how’s everything with your dad?

8
00:02:40,909 --> 00:02:42,691
- It’s fine, thanks.
- Yeah.

9
00:02:44,652 --> 00:02:49,066
And... how about with us?

10
00:02:50,279 --> 00:02:51,641
Moment of weakness, right?

11
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:55,500
- I’ve been feeling guilty about it all weekend.
- Me too.

12
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:59,730
Listen, lets just bury it and pretend it didn’t happen, okay?

13
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:01,470
Sure.

14
00:03:03,918 --> 00:03:07,703
Hi friend! Girl. Boy. What’s the latest scandal?

15
00:03:09,014 --> 00:03:12,909
You two never have any good gossip. Are we still redoing your bedroom tonight?

16
00:03:12,976 --> 00:03:14,466
- Yes.
- Terrific.

17
00:03:14,681 --> 00:03:16,826
- You up for some heavy lifting? 
- Well, I…

18
00:03:16,878 --> 00:03:19,955
- …Would love to help? 
- Yeah.

19
00:03:20,303 --> 00:03:24,266
You, me and broody in your bedroom all night. The web cam pervs are gonna love it.

20
00:03:26,323 --> 00:03:30,016
Dan has a son from a previous relationship. Lucas.

21
00:03:30,113 --> 00:03:33,015
She’s know about this kid for years and all of a sudden it’s grounds for separation?

22
00:03:33,066 --> 00:03:37,000
He joined Nathan’s basketball team. That’s when things got worse.

23
00:03:37,056 --> 00:03:40,143
Dan as I recall you chose not to be a part of Lucas’ life.

24
00:03:41,378 --> 00:03:44,434
Richmond University. Wow.

25
00:03:44,874 --> 00:03:48,550
Not exactly the end all and be all to psychology degrees. Am I right, doc?

26
00:03:50,285 --> 00:03:51,945
We were talking about Lucas.

27
00:03:52,005 --> 00:03:55,692
Hey doc, did you ever read that article about the mountain climber who had his arm wedged beneath a boulder?

28
00:03:56,849 --> 00:03:59,635
His arm was caught beneath a thousand pound rock.

29
00:03:59,687 --> 00:04:02,692
So he cut it off just below the elbow using nothing but a pocket knife.

30
00:04:04,116 --> 00:04:07,121
Of course he had to break the bone first.

31
00:04:07,422 --> 00:04:09,137
Some people find that hard to believe.

32
00:04:10,772 --> 00:04:12,077
But it’s simple really.

33
00:04:12,794 --> 00:04:16,496
He found himself faced with a difficult situation, he did what he had to do to survive.

34
00:04:17,821 --> 00:04:19,004
I made a choice.

35
00:04:20,099 --> 00:04:22,055
To cut away the part of me that he me trapped.

36
00:04:22,266 --> 00:04:24,226
You can question my judgment if you want to.

37
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:28,072
The fact of the matter is, you can never really understand it,

38
00:04:28,441 --> 00:04:30,345
until it’s you that’s caught beneath the weight.

39
00:04:32,572 --> 00:04:34,421
And was I a weight too?

40
00:04:35,428 --> 00:04:38,061
Because I got pregnant shortly after Karen.

41
00:04:39,141 --> 00:04:41,600
How do you explain being with me and not her?

42
00:04:44,517 --> 00:04:46,284
Because with you I saw a future.

43
00:05:15,749 --> 00:05:16,728
Hey, Peyton.

44
00:05:18,174 --> 00:05:22,170
Oh, hey Brooke had to take off early so she said for you to call her.

45
00:05:22,709 --> 00:05:23,512
Okay.

46
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:25,540
You got a sec?

47
00:05:26,506 --> 00:05:28,622
Uh, yeah. What’s up?

48
00:05:29,502 --> 00:05:30,481
I lied.

49
00:05:31,536 --> 00:05:33,921
Okay, I can’t bury what happened between us.

50
00:05:34,075 --> 00:05:37,546
Lucas, Brooke is my best friend. And she’s your girlfriend.

51
00:05:37,608 --> 00:05:41,295
- I know. But…
- But nothing. Okay?

52
00:05:41,681 --> 00:05:43,091
That’s where we’re at right now.

53
00:05:44,679 --> 00:05:47,438
It’s not fair to her to make a big deal out of what happened.

54
00:05:47,665 --> 00:05:48,795
It didn’t mean anything.

55
00:05:50,714 --> 00:05:52,348
- I’m sorry. 
- Peyton.

56
00:06:04,979 --> 00:06:08,641
See? It does mean something.

57
00:06:10,484 --> 00:06:12,347
- It can’t.
- But it does.

58
00:06:12,773 --> 00:06:17,950
- Lucas, you’re dating Brooke. 
- I know. And she’s great. Okay?

59
00:06:18,001 --> 00:06:20,874
But, she’s not you.

60
00:06:21,856 --> 00:06:26,325
Look, ever since you came to my room and you told me how you felt about me

61
00:06:26,741 --> 00:06:28,255
I’ve been hiding with Brooke.

62
00:06:29,725 --> 00:06:32,491
Okay? I’ve been trying not to get hurt again.

63
00:06:35,731 --> 00:06:37,133
I don’t want to hide anymore.

64
00:06:39,033 --> 00:06:41,726
Even if we could be together, what makes you think it would work?

65
00:06:44,527 --> 00:06:49,181
Cause I feel it in my heart. Don’t you?

66
00:06:50,681 --> 00:06:51,450
Yes.

67
00:06:54,795 --> 00:06:56,155
So what are we going to do?

68
00:07:11,006 --> 00:07:12,293
What’s up, loser?

69
00:07:12,406 --> 00:07:17,372
Hey, you. I’m just finishing up this email to my mom cause she comes back tomorrow.

70
00:07:17,433 --> 00:07:19,721
Oh cool. Tell her I said ’Hi’.

71
00:07:20,669 --> 00:07:22,451
You’re going to call me when she gets back from the airport, right?

72
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,316
Oh yeah.

73
00:07:23,879 --> 00:07:24,510
Cool.

74
00:07:25,139 --> 00:07:30,532
So, I need to borrow a couple of things from you, like your basketball and you.

75
00:07:33,271 --> 00:07:34,459
Okay, why?

76
00:07:34,621 --> 00:07:39,879
Because I’m totally flagging PE and I need you to show me how to throw a stinking free shot.

77
00:07:41,831 --> 00:07:43,771
- Free throw.
- Whatever

78
00:07:45,704 --> 00:07:50,069
You know I’d love to, Hales, but I’ve got to do some stuff with Brooke and Peyton tonight.

79
00:07:50,396 --> 00:07:51,365
Like what?

80
00:07:51,862 --> 00:07:53,663
I kind of need to talk to you about something.

81
00:07:54,014 --> 00:07:54,902
What’s going on?

82
00:07:56,924 --> 00:07:59,541
- Hey, tutor girl.
- Tiger, what’s up?

83
00:08:00,283 --> 00:08:02,164
Never mind. Rain check?

84
00:08:03,884 --> 00:08:05,496
You kids have fun.

85
00:08:08,045 --> 00:08:08,973
You ready to go?

86
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:12,602
Yeah, sure.

87
00:08:13,554 --> 00:08:14,999
Then lets go, boyfriend.

88
00:08:20,313 --> 00:08:21,546
What’s the good word, coach?

89
00:08:22,535 --> 00:08:23,922
There is no good word.

90
00:08:25,187 --> 00:08:26,708
What brings you around here?

91
00:08:27,584 --> 00:08:32,632
Oh, a little victory celebration.

92
00:08:33,141 --> 00:08:34,271
What’s the occasion?

93
00:08:35,845 --> 00:08:38,607
I thought you might want to toast your 500th win.

94
00:08:39,871 --> 00:08:44,217
499. I haven’t made it yet.

95
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:46,238
Yeah, well I’m beating the rush.

96
00:08:46,635 --> 00:08:50,440
Well, I guess this could serve as a dual toast.

97
00:08:51,949 --> 00:08:53,306
Why’s that?

98
00:08:53,625 --> 00:08:55,534
I’m thinking of stepping down.

99
00:08:57,438 --> 00:08:59,907
That come as a big surprise to you, Keith?

100
00:08:59,962 --> 00:09:02,518
Well  yeah. Yeah, it does.

101
00:09:03,668 --> 00:09:05,799
A fellow can’t coach forever.

102
00:09:07,309 --> 00:09:11,002
Well, he can’t quit while he still loves the game.

103
00:09:12,906 --> 00:09:14,370
Who says I love it?

104
00:09:15,235 --> 00:09:19,070
You do. Every time you step out onto that court.

105
00:09:20,483 --> 00:09:22,393
This game is what keeps you young.

106
00:09:22,690 --> 00:09:27,934
Without it you’d... I don’t know you’d be off somewhere babbling, wearing a dress.

107
00:09:28,662 --> 00:09:30,392
You haven’t seen me at home.

108
00:09:33,746 --> 00:09:37,349
I promised myself I’d coach for 20 years,

109
00:09:37,718 --> 00:09:40,979
then Camilla and I would start living.

110
00:09:42,644 --> 00:09:47,375
35  years later, here I am.

111
00:09:57,913 --> 00:09:59,222
Was that your jump shot?

112
00:09:59,898 --> 00:10:02,918
Cause if that was your jump shot, I can’t date you anymore.

113
00:10:04,007 --> 00:10:06,718
My mom said you’d be here. Something about a grade?

114
00:10:06,943 --> 00:10:08,730
Yeah. You cannot be here right now.

115
00:10:08,899 --> 00:10:11,305
- Why not?
- Because I look stupid.

116
00:10:11,574 --> 00:10:15,581
You realize I’ve seen you in that crocheted poncho thing you wear, right?

117
00:10:16,885 --> 00:10:22,314
Come on this is embarrassing! I want you to think I’m… not embarrassing.

118
00:10:22,626 --> 00:10:24,158
You don’t embarrass me, Haley.

119
00:10:24,531 --> 00:10:25,838
Oh yeah? Okay.

120
00:10:30,435 --> 00:10:32,355
Okay, I take that back.

121
00:10:32,416 --> 00:10:34,608
- I can’t do it.
- Yes you can. Just...

122
00:10:34,875 --> 00:10:37,796
Alright, square your shoulders, to the basket.

123
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:41,827
And you’ve got to bring the ball up right past your nose like this. Okay?

124
00:10:42,379 --> 00:10:43,363
Bend your knees a little.

125
00:10:45,287 --> 00:10:46,839
Relax your hips.

126
00:10:48,636 --> 00:10:49,584
And just shoot.

127
00:10:52,999 --> 00:10:56,735
Okay, that wasn’t perfect but it also wasn’t embarrassing.

128
00:10:57,199 --> 00:10:58,664
It was actually kind of sexy.

129
00:11:06,248 --> 00:11:07,575
- Come again.
- Thanks.

130
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:12,029
I got to hand it to you, Deb. You’ve done one hell of a job here.

131
00:11:12,515 --> 00:11:13,346
Thanks, Keith.

132
00:11:14,267 --> 00:11:16,494
So I hope you don’t take this the wrong way,

133
00:11:16,545 --> 00:11:20,089
but I’m just really excited about Karen coming back.

134
00:11:20,318 --> 00:11:21,989
Yeah, so am I.

135
00:11:22,706 --> 00:11:25,629
If you don’t mind me asking, how are things with you and Dan?

136
00:11:27,052 --> 00:11:32,910
Oh, I don’t know. We’re going to therapy but I’m not sure we can find our way back.

137
00:11:33,739 --> 00:11:34,605
To where?

138
00:11:35,326 --> 00:11:36,678
The people we used to be.

139
00:11:37,499 --> 00:11:41,317
We used to laugh more. We were kind to each other.

140
00:11:42,228 --> 00:11:43,467
We were in love.

141
00:11:44,296 --> 00:11:45,392
What about now?

142
00:11:46,704 --> 00:11:48,055
I honestly don’t know.

143
00:11:51,347 --> 00:11:52,335
A little help!

144
00:11:55,790 --> 00:11:56,750
Thanks.

145
00:11:57,170 --> 00:11:58,080
My pleasure.

146
00:11:59,830 --> 00:12:01,410
- I’m Carrie.
- Dan.

147
00:12:02,042 --> 00:12:04,665
Dan. I was wondering what the name of the attractive man

148
00:12:04,709 --> 00:12:06,675
who jogs past my bungalow every morning was.

149
00:12:06,738 --> 00:12:08,627
Yeah? What was it?

150
00:12:10,491 --> 00:12:12,380
So what are you doing on my beach, Carrie?

151
00:12:12,831 --> 00:12:14,592
I heard it’s a great place to pick up guys.

152
00:12:15,033 --> 00:12:16,169
Only the light ones.

153
00:12:18,596 --> 00:12:21,275
Well, it was a pleasure meeting you.

154
00:12:22,785 --> 00:12:24,290
Even with the ugly hat.

155
00:12:25,687 --> 00:12:26,588
Um, Dan.

156
00:12:28,852 --> 00:12:30,101
The yellow cottage is mine.

157
00:12:31,094 --> 00:12:32,589
Come by and see me sometime.

158
00:12:47,708 --> 00:12:49,628
Hey girly, lets do some damage.

159
00:12:53,459 --> 00:12:54,753
- We’re going to hell.
- Peyton.

160
00:12:54,805 --> 00:12:57,258
No honestly, we are horrible, rotten people.

161
00:12:58,098 --> 00:12:59,808
Come on you two, lets go!

162
00:13:00,755 --> 00:13:04,687
- Lucas, I don’t want to hurt her.
- Neither do I. Okay? But we’ve got to tell her.

163
00:13:07,207 --> 00:13:08,037
Tonight.

164
00:13:10,765 --> 00:13:11,733
Lets go!

165
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:27,063
Okay, broody show us what you’ve got.

166
00:13:37,028 --> 00:13:39,606
Want to hear a secret? I know you do.

167
00:13:40,389 --> 00:13:41,056
Brooke…

168
00:13:41,142 --> 00:13:44,296
I’m falling for him. Big time.

169
00:13:45,166 --> 00:13:47,374
Speechless right? I know, it’s crazy but...

170
00:13:47,604 --> 00:13:52,232
this is like L-O-V-E mad crushed out, I’m in big trouble.

171
00:13:53,538 --> 00:13:57,582
- That’s…
- What is this? On the stereo.

172
00:13:57,838 --> 00:14:01,326
- It’s Tegan and Sara. 
- I know that. But what song?

173
00:14:03,108 --> 00:14:04,234
Don’t confess.

174
00:14:07,291 --> 00:14:10,553
Um, you know what? I totally flaked. I forgot paint brushes.

175
00:14:10,656 --> 00:14:11,637
Well, we could finger paint.

176
00:14:11,689 --> 00:14:14,858
No, really. Maybe we should just do this another time.

177
00:14:15,083 --> 00:14:17,111
I’m kind of not feeling well right now.

178
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:22,302
Really, you guys should go. Okay? Cause I’m going to launch any second now.

179
00:14:22,395 --> 00:14:25,446
Well how about we do it tomorrow night, after Lucas’ mom gets back.

180
00:14:25,493 --> 00:14:27,499
Fine, tomorrow night.

181
00:14:29,435 --> 00:14:30,182
Okay.

182
00:14:30,668 --> 00:14:32,293
Come on, I’ll let you buy me hot chocolate.

183
00:14:32,879 --> 00:14:35,779
And P. Sawyer, please don’t hurl too much.

184
00:14:35,886 --> 00:14:38,716
Because if you get any thinner, I’m gonna start looking fat.

185
00:14:42,748 --> 00:14:44,292
I cant do this to her.

186
00:14:52,704 --> 00:14:54,707
Have I told you lately how much I like you?

187
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:57,881
Why?

188
00:14:58,196 --> 00:14:59,454
Why do I tell you?

189
00:15:00,682 --> 00:15:02,474
No, why do you like me?

190
00:15:03,197 --> 00:15:05,516
Hmm, pity mostly.

191
00:15:08,055 --> 00:15:09,545
How come you’re so quiet tonight?

192
00:15:10,692 --> 00:15:13,846
I’m just anxious about my mom coming back tomorrow.

193
00:15:14,190 --> 00:15:15,249
Yeah, me too.

194
00:15:16,677 --> 00:15:17,533
Why are you?

195
00:15:18,351 --> 00:15:19,877
Cause I want her to like me.

196
00:15:21,127 --> 00:15:25,396
Plus she sounds really cool, and I’m not that close with my mom so...

197
00:15:25,683 --> 00:15:27,982
I just think it’d be great if I hit it off with yours.

198
00:15:32,298 --> 00:15:33,815
You can’t control love, you know?

199
00:15:36,215 --> 00:15:38,023
Your mom and Keith.

200
00:15:38,964 --> 00:15:41,069
You’re  worried about their relationship, right?

201
00:15:42,165 --> 00:15:43,025
Right.

202
00:15:44,495 --> 00:15:45,606
They’ll be okay.

203
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:51,165
People that are meant to be together always find their way in the end.

204
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:15,988
- Hey.
- Hey.

205
00:16:16,054 --> 00:16:18,020
- I was hoping you’d be here.
- What’s up?

206
00:16:19,781 --> 00:16:25,399
Um, I actually need some advice, and I didn’t have anybody to talk to.

207
00:16:25,588 --> 00:16:29,837
Brooke’s not around? Sorry. Where’s the rest of your minions?

208
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:31,159
What Minions?

209
00:16:31,313 --> 00:16:32,710
You’re like the queen of the hive.

210
00:16:33,939 --> 00:16:39,069
I guess I have a lot of friends, but I don’t really have any I can talk to.

211
00:16:39,775 --> 00:16:43,835
Okay, um, lets just go over…

212
00:16:44,471 --> 00:16:46,227
So what’s on your mind?

213
00:16:47,194 --> 00:16:47,901
Um...

214
00:16:50,168 --> 00:16:55,033
you know when you first realized that you liked Nathan, and you knew that Lucas would flip out?

215
00:16:55,796 --> 00:16:56,871
How’d you deal with that?

216
00:16:57,369 --> 00:16:59,324
Why? What’s going on?

217
00:16:59,590 --> 00:17:01,162
It’s just friend of a friend stuff.

218
00:17:02,099 --> 00:17:03,753
Okay, um...

219
00:17:04,977 --> 00:17:11,040
I sort of asked myself, repeatedly, if this thing with Nathan is really worth losing my best friend over.

220
00:17:11,914 --> 00:17:12,580
Yeah.

221
00:17:12,784 --> 00:17:16,501
Look, if Lucas is really my best friend, then he should just be happy for me.

222
00:17:16,977 --> 00:17:18,422
It’s not like he was dating Nathan.

223
00:17:21,521 --> 00:17:23,168
Are you sure you’re okay?

224
00:17:23,588 --> 00:17:26,209
- I’m good. Thanks Haley.
- Sure.

225
00:17:31,521 --> 00:17:39,245
Coach for 20 years, Win 500 games, Make a difference.

226
00:17:43,807 --> 00:17:44,538
Yeah.

227
00:17:45,056 --> 00:17:46,008
You wanted to see me?

228
00:17:48,501 --> 00:17:51,926
That was an interesting meal the other night, wasn’t it?

229
00:17:52,517 --> 00:17:53,217
Yeah.

230
00:17:56,744 --> 00:17:58,443
Tell me something, Nathan.

231
00:17:59,837 --> 00:18:01,645
Have I made a difference to you?

232
00:18:02,459 --> 00:18:03,350
What do you mean?

233
00:18:03,448 --> 00:18:09,212
I mean being on this team, me rattling on all the time, have you learned anything?

234
00:18:10,706 --> 00:18:12,924
I move my feet better on defense.

235
00:18:17,926 --> 00:18:19,856
Well, that’s something, I guess.

236
00:18:24,696 --> 00:18:28,684
There’s a couple of new plays in that folder that you missed out on.

237
00:18:38,776 --> 00:18:44,280
Coach, I just wanted to say thanks. For letting me back on the team.

238
00:18:57,749 --> 00:18:59,302
Today’s the day, I still suck.

239
00:18:59,363 --> 00:19:01,125
Come on, it’s alright. Just keep your elbows in.

240
00:19:04,447 --> 00:19:05,267
What’s this?

241
00:19:07,185 --> 00:19:10,345
Hey, dad. I’m just giving Haley a few pointers.

242
00:19:10,417 --> 00:19:11,114
I’ll bet.

243
00:19:11,804 --> 00:19:13,710
- Haley.
- Mr. Scott.

244
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:17,807
So Nathan, I thought we’d grill up some steaks at the beach house for dinner. Just the two of us.

245
00:19:18,098 --> 00:19:23,151
That sounds great, Dad. But... Haley and I have plans tonight.

246
00:19:25,114 --> 00:19:25,926
Okay.

247
00:19:26,981 --> 00:19:28,030
Some other time, huh?

248
00:19:28,419 --> 00:19:33,041
Sure. I heard you were back on the team. I think that’s a good move.

249
00:19:33,123 --> 00:19:33,821
Yeah.

250
00:19:37,006 --> 00:19:38,030
How’s my house?

251
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:47,174
I’m sorry. You should go with your dad tonight, if you want.

252
00:19:47,274 --> 00:19:50,004
I don’t want to go with my dad. I want to be with you.

253
00:19:50,384 --> 00:19:52,335
Now knock down this shot like I know you can.

254
00:19:59,201 --> 00:20:02,468
It’s okay. This calls for drastic measures.

255
00:20:04,245 --> 00:20:06,635
You’re going to be fine. Try it granny style.

256
00:21:23,104 --> 00:21:26,064
Hey. I so owe you.

257
00:21:26,883 --> 00:21:28,741
Good, cause I need a favor.

258
00:21:38,107 --> 00:21:38,760
Hey.

259
00:21:41,689 --> 00:21:45,352
I just came by to check on you.

260
00:21:46,071 --> 00:21:48,591
You know, considering the throw down with mom and dad and everything.

261
00:21:49,036 --> 00:21:50,772
Oh, so now you’re concerned about me.

262
00:21:51,203 --> 00:21:53,757
After bringing Whitey to my house last week to antagonize me.

263
00:21:54,591 --> 00:21:55,626
I didn’t think it would hurt.

264
00:21:55,682 --> 00:21:57,695
No, Keith, you knew it would. That’s why you did it.

265
00:21:58,227 --> 00:22:01,933
Okay whatever, Danny, look I just came by to see how you were doing. My mistake.

266
00:22:02,185 --> 00:22:03,731
Yet another one by you.

267
00:22:05,523 --> 00:22:07,652
You know, it’s no wonder you’re all alone out here.

268
00:22:07,719 --> 00:22:09,972
You’re right, Keith, I am alone. Now.

269
00:22:10,284 --> 00:22:14,165
But you’re alone period. You want to know why? Because you’re malicious.

270
00:22:14,237 --> 00:22:15,215
I’m malicious?

271
00:22:15,523 --> 00:22:18,522
You bring Whitey to my house, you put Lucas on the basketball team,

272
00:22:18,788 --> 00:22:22,496
so its no wonder I’m out here by myself. It’s almost as if you planed it that way.

273
00:22:22,742 --> 00:22:26,452
Easy on the conspiracy theories, Danny. Maybe you want to take a look in the mirror.

274
00:22:28,937 --> 00:22:30,478
Oh so where are you running off to now?

275
00:22:34,025 --> 00:22:34,814
The airport.

276
00:22:35,096 --> 00:22:39,398
Right, still living that lie huh? Unless of course you and Karen are a couple.

277
00:22:39,535 --> 00:22:41,767
As a matter of fact, after tonight, we will be.

278
00:22:41,839 --> 00:22:45,490
Wow. High School fantasies really do come true.

279
00:22:45,761 --> 00:22:49,043
Well, you always had a thing for her. Even when I was with her.

280
00:22:49,714 --> 00:22:52,412
But you should ask yourself one question, Keith.

281
00:22:53,584 --> 00:22:58,080
If you weren’t good enough for her then, what makes you think you’ll be good enough for her now?

282
00:23:14,254 --> 00:23:15,391
- Hey.
- Hey.

283
00:23:15,749 --> 00:23:17,838
- 3 hours till Karen. 
- Yep.

284
00:23:19,508 --> 00:23:21,586
So ask me what mistake I just made.

285
00:23:22,876 --> 00:23:24,561
What mistake did you just make?

286
00:23:24,709 --> 00:23:27,254
I... just went to see Dan.

287
00:23:28,252 --> 00:23:29,242
Why?

288
00:23:30,142 --> 00:23:31,233
I don’t know. Brotherly Love.

289
00:23:31,591 --> 00:23:36,664
I thought maybe he could use someone to talk to, but he’s in a really dark place right now.

290
00:23:37,181 --> 00:23:39,869
I’m sorry, he doesn’t do well alone.

291
00:23:40,117 --> 00:23:44,687
Well sure. No one to tear down when he’s alone. Except himself.

292
00:23:46,214 --> 00:23:47,075
You hungry?

293
00:23:47,647 --> 00:23:50,038
Oh no. But I could use a beer.

294
00:23:50,479 --> 00:23:51,764
3 hours to Karen?

295
00:23:52,350 --> 00:23:56,149
I know. That’s why I could use a breezer.

296
00:23:58,660 --> 00:24:00,396
I never told you this but...

297
00:24:01,477 --> 00:24:05,705
before she left, she kissed me in the airport.

298
00:24:05,818 --> 00:24:08,998
And it wasn’t just one of those, you know, see you later kind of kisses.

299
00:24:09,464 --> 00:24:11,256
Keith, that’s great.

300
00:24:11,337 --> 00:24:15,843
Yeah  it is. It’s funny, I feel like I’m about to start the life that I always wanted.

301
00:24:17,031 --> 00:24:19,878
It’s 3 hours away. I’m scared as hell.

302
00:24:20,671 --> 00:24:22,741
Well, it couldn’t happen to two better people.

303
00:24:23,263 --> 00:24:23,903
Thanks.

304
00:24:24,373 --> 00:24:25,300
You’re going to be fine.

305
00:24:31,585 --> 00:24:32,765
Dan. Dan.

306
00:24:34,035 --> 00:24:35,080
You disappoint me.

307
00:24:35,522 --> 00:24:36,595
How’s that, Carrie?

308
00:24:36,666 --> 00:24:38,392
You don’t call, You don’t write.

309
00:24:38,772 --> 00:24:42,483
And when I come over to invite you to dinner, you start without me.

310
00:24:48,131 --> 00:24:51,868
Actually you’re right on time. Would you care to join me?

311
00:24:52,493 --> 00:24:53,757
I’d like that.

312
00:24:59,446 --> 00:25:03,666
Hey, did you know that Whitey’s real name is Brian?

313
00:25:04,376 --> 00:25:05,493
Brian Durham?

314
00:25:05,647 --> 00:25:06,435
Yeah!

315
00:25:06,768 --> 00:25:07,572
Who knew?

316
00:25:08,111 --> 00:25:11,100
Come here, this is great. This site’s got his whole record before Tree Hill.

317
00:25:11,468 --> 00:25:12,374
That’s perfect.

318
00:25:14,872 --> 00:25:16,650
I’m gonna go get something to drink, do you want anything?

319
00:25:16,716 --> 00:25:17,790
No I’m fine, thanks.

320
00:25:27,730 --> 00:25:31,447
This is so wrong. Sneaking around behind Brooke.

321
00:25:34,537 --> 00:25:35,747
Do you think that’s part of it?

322
00:25:36,270 --> 00:25:37,171
Part of what?

323
00:25:38,590 --> 00:25:42,704
Us. You know, that this is wrong.

324
00:25:43,263 --> 00:25:46,403
Somehow it makes it feel deeper.

325
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:50,975
Lucas, Brooke and I have been best friends since elementary school.

326
00:25:51,326 --> 00:25:54,266
We’ve always put our friendship before guys.

327
00:25:55,485 --> 00:25:58,609
Do you really think I’d risk losing my best friend over a fling?

328
00:25:58,655 --> 00:26:00,969
Cause I wouldn’t do that.

329
00:26:03,021 --> 00:26:03,852
Okay.

330
00:26:06,498 --> 00:26:07,856
Look, I don’t want to hurt Brooke.

331
00:26:08,587 --> 00:26:11,229
And I don’t want to come between the two of you. But...

332
00:26:13,927 --> 00:26:15,341
I have to be with you.

333
00:26:34,649 --> 00:26:36,081
Would you like something to drink, Carrie?

334
00:26:37,853 --> 00:26:39,251
How's your red wine selection?

335
00:26:40,454 --> 00:26:41,370
Excellent.

336
00:26:47,356 --> 00:26:48,365
Do you need a hand?

337
00:26:48,666 --> 00:26:50,446
No, I’m just looking for a cork screw.

338
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:53,455
Well, you better find one or you’ll never get me drunk.

339
00:27:04,170 --> 00:27:05,068
Dan?

340
00:27:07,908 --> 00:27:08,715
I’m sorry.

341
00:27:10,724 --> 00:27:12,388
I’m sure you’re a great person, Carrie.

342
00:27:13,862 --> 00:27:15,885
But I have a wife I love very much.

343
00:27:17,734 --> 00:27:20,473
That’s sweet, but also a coincidence.

344
00:27:21,210 --> 00:27:24,041
Since I have a husband I love very much.

345
00:27:26,561 --> 00:27:28,834
But then again, our spouses aren’t here, are they?

346
00:27:33,544 --> 00:27:35,098
Or maybe one of them is.

347
00:27:39,432 --> 00:27:42,749
I guess I’ll go.

348
00:27:46,099 --> 00:27:47,127
Deb...

349
00:27:53,359 --> 00:27:54,814
Hey, we’re just about to pick up my mom.

350
00:27:56,324 --> 00:27:57,910
What is going on with you and Peyton?

351
00:27:58,871 --> 00:27:59,743
Nothing.

352
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:01,515
So you guys weren’t together recently?

353
00:28:01,592 --> 00:28:04,494
No. Why? What’d you talk to Peyton?

354
00:28:04,588 --> 00:28:06,840
Why? Are you trying to figure out what lie to tell me next?

355
00:28:09,775 --> 00:28:12,011
- I wanted to tell you, Hales.
- Tell me what?

356
00:28:12,156 --> 00:28:14,213
- That we’ve been…
- Yeah, I know you’ve been

357
00:28:14,264 --> 00:28:18,063
cause I saw you kissing her which is a really jack ass move considering you have a girlfriend named Brooke.

358
00:28:18,135 --> 00:28:20,300
Don’t lecture me, Haley. I know that.

359
00:28:20,358 --> 00:28:22,835
- So stop it.
- I can’t. It’s complicated.

360
00:28:22,911 --> 00:28:25,616
It’s not complicated, it’s simple. It’s really simple.

361
00:28:25,693 --> 00:28:29,579
What you’re doing is wrong. And if you can’t see that, I don’t like the person you’re becoming.

362
00:28:29,645 --> 00:28:32,297
Okay, the person I’m becoming? What about the person you’re becoming?

363
00:28:32,358 --> 00:28:34,473
- What does that mean?
- You know what it means, Haley.

364
00:28:35,544 --> 00:28:39,092
Nathan says a few nice things to you to get back at me and you fall for it.

365
00:28:39,153 --> 00:28:42,542
Oh my God! If I hear that one more time. You know that I did that for you.

366
00:28:42,614 --> 00:28:43,837
- You did it for me?!
- Yeah.

367
00:28:43,905 --> 00:28:46,218
Okay, is that what you tell yourself every time you’re kissing him?

368
00:28:46,295 --> 00:28:49,874
That you’re doing it for me? You’re the one that’s lying.

369
00:28:49,942 --> 00:28:52,412
Alright, if you’re looking for betrayal, look to yourself.

370
00:28:52,582 --> 00:28:55,885
You know what, Luke? Next time you see me, don’t talk to me.

371
00:28:55,957 --> 00:28:56,674
Fine!

372
00:28:56,848 --> 00:28:57,483
Fine!

373
00:29:02,187 --> 00:29:07,833
It was completely innocent. She has a beach house. I had an extra steak.

374
00:29:08,266 --> 00:29:10,043
And a bottle of wine.

375
00:29:11,978 --> 00:29:13,735
Deb, I was lonely for some company.

376
00:29:16,699 --> 00:29:21,978
I’m lonely too, Dan. But I’m not off frolicking with the pool boy.

377
00:29:22,213 --> 00:29:25,561
Conversation, Deb. Remember? Like we used to have?

378
00:29:25,639 --> 00:29:29,995
Okay, so it’s my fault? My deficiencies as a conversationalist

379
00:29:30,052 --> 00:29:32,765
have driven you to dine with beach whores.

380
00:29:35,218 --> 00:29:36,128
Are you hungry?

381
00:29:38,516 --> 00:29:41,521
Oh Deb, please. Deb. Deb, don’t go.

382
00:29:41,926 --> 00:29:45,003
Deb, wait. Look. Look at this.

383
00:29:49,647 --> 00:29:51,161
Those two people were happy.

384
00:29:52,011 --> 00:29:53,214
They loved each other.

385
00:29:55,642 --> 00:29:58,176
The hurricane that fall washed half the beach away.

386
00:30:00,393 --> 00:30:01,345
Yeah.

387
00:30:03,349 --> 00:30:05,288
And took those people with it.

388
00:30:10,149 --> 00:30:11,437
Deb, don’t go.

389
00:30:19,146 --> 00:30:20,228
I love you.

390
00:30:32,737 --> 00:30:34,037
So you’re just going to quit, huh?

391
00:30:35,401 --> 00:30:37,329
Win 500 games and walk away?

392
00:30:39,685 --> 00:30:41,272
I did a little research in the library.

393
00:30:41,897 --> 00:30:43,273
You were in the library?

394
00:30:45,803 --> 00:30:48,075
Temperature must have dropped in hell.

395
00:30:51,399 --> 00:30:56,595
I promised Camilla I’d win 500 games then walk away.

396
00:30:58,091 --> 00:30:59,894
We were going to grow old together.

397
00:31:00,063 --> 00:31:01,414
You’re already old, coach.

398
00:31:02,499 --> 00:31:04,250
Besides, who’s going to yell at me, huh?

399
00:31:05,038 --> 00:31:08,372
I’m not supposed to yell at you, Nathan, you’re supposed to learn things.

400
00:31:08,434 --> 00:31:11,020
Yeah but what fun would that be? You love yelling at me.

401
00:31:11,085 --> 00:31:12,493
- I do not! 
- Yes, you do.

402
00:31:12,555 --> 00:31:14,557
You love to yell at me and I love to make you yell.

403
00:31:14,619 --> 00:31:17,230
Well, if you’d listen once and a while you knucklehead!

404
00:31:21,367 --> 00:31:24,003
You know not many coaches win 500 games.

405
00:31:24,173 --> 00:31:28,197
No not many high school coaches win 500 games, you know why?

406
00:31:28,256 --> 00:31:30,577
Cause they move up to the next level.

407
00:31:30,628 --> 00:31:37,331
To carpeted locker rooms and air-conditioned buses, and games that matter.

408
00:31:39,204 --> 00:31:42,619
That’s a bunch of crap, coach. And you know it.

409
00:31:43,230 --> 00:31:44,863
These are the games that matter.

410
00:31:45,702 --> 00:31:48,550
They matter to kids who are just trying to figure themselves out.

411
00:31:49,517 --> 00:31:50,874
Figure out who they’re going to be.

412
00:31:52,261 --> 00:31:57,212
Look, the other day, you asked me if you’ve made a difference.

413
00:31:58,779 --> 00:31:59,717
Well, you have.

414
00:32:02,824 --> 00:32:03,790
At least with me.

415
00:32:09,572 --> 00:32:10,356
Son.

416
00:32:14,196 --> 00:32:18,271
At some point, you’ve got to do it on your own.

417
00:32:19,172 --> 00:32:20,432
Yeah, at some point.

418
00:32:22,428 --> 00:32:24,856
We both know I’ve got a long way to go, coach.

419
00:32:29,290 --> 00:32:30,677
Just don’t give up on me.

420
00:32:46,063 --> 00:32:48,639
Hi it’s Deb, leave a message and I’ll get back to you.

421
00:32:50,465 --> 00:32:55,329
Deb, it’s me. I’m coming to see you.

422
00:33:29,475 --> 00:33:32,902
It’s like they’re all judging you. You can’t hide in here anymore.

423
00:33:34,816 --> 00:33:36,367
Well, Lucas should be here soon.

424
00:33:40,903 --> 00:33:42,296
Brooke, you’re my best friend.

425
00:33:45,623 --> 00:33:47,349
- So…
- No, I mean it.

426
00:33:48,497 --> 00:33:50,242
You’re my best friend, you know that, right?

427
00:33:51,250 --> 00:33:55,557
Yeah, crazy. What drugs are you on and can I have some?

428
00:33:58,009 --> 00:33:59,463
I need to tell you something....

429
00:34:00,523 --> 00:34:01,363
What’s wrong?

430
00:34:02,366 --> 00:34:04,281
I had a little disagreement with Lucas.

431
00:34:05,156 --> 00:34:06,624
- About me?
- No...

432
00:34:08,053 --> 00:34:11,445
just the way he’s been acting, he’s really disappointing me.

433
00:34:13,889 --> 00:34:14,798
What?

434
00:34:15,486 --> 00:34:18,454
Nothing, it’s just kind of ironic.

435
00:34:19,402 --> 00:34:20,440
What’s ironic?

436
00:34:20,584 --> 00:34:21,843
Lucas, being a jerk.

437
00:34:23,294 --> 00:34:26,368
How is that… how is that ironic?

438
00:34:26,656 --> 00:34:28,909
Well, cause that used to be my role, right?

439
00:34:29,186 --> 00:34:31,859
I mean this whole thing started cause I was just trying to mess with Lucas.

440
00:34:32,365 --> 00:34:34,152
It’s just kind of weird, that’s all.

441
00:34:57,955 --> 00:35:01,328
- I need to come home.
- No. No.

442
00:35:02,204 --> 00:35:04,719
- Deb…
- Don’t, Dan.

443
00:35:05,512 --> 00:35:07,207
There’s nothing you can say anymore.

444
00:35:10,029 --> 00:35:11,426
I want a divorce.

445
00:35:18,399 --> 00:35:19,740
So you excited to see your mom?

446
00:35:21,390 --> 00:35:22,270
Yeah.

447
00:35:22,863 --> 00:35:25,544
It seems like just yesterday I was kissing her goodbye at the airport.

448
00:35:25,609 --> 00:35:27,104
Wait, you were kissing my mother?

449
00:35:27,195 --> 00:35:28,563
Yeah, saying goodbye.

450
00:35:29,289 --> 00:35:33,719
Okay, Keith could you just do me a favor and keep the PDA to a minimum.

451
00:35:37,932 --> 00:35:41,267
You think maybe you could keep that tattoo covered up for a while?

452
00:35:41,767 --> 00:35:44,384
Like, say, the rest of your life.

453
00:35:52,725 --> 00:35:56,611
Listen, Luke, I know it wasn’t always smooth sailing between us, but...

454
00:35:56,947 --> 00:36:00,302
whatever your mom wants us to be, I just want you to know that…

455
00:36:00,354 --> 00:36:01,404
I love you too, Keith.

456
00:36:25,857 --> 00:36:26,946
Keith!

457
00:36:29,059 --> 00:36:31,324
Easy, easy Keith I got you. Come on.

458
00:36:32,121 --> 00:36:33,403
Lucas. Get Lucas!

459
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:02,982
Dan. Is Luke okay?

460
00:37:03,611 --> 00:37:05,199
He’s going to be okay, Keith.

461
00:37:38,729 --> 00:37:40,107
I need a doctor.

462
00:37:41,168 --> 00:37:42,780
My brother’s in the car, he needs some help.

463
00:37:42,873 --> 00:37:44,203
- What happened?
- Car Accident.

464
00:37:44,612 --> 00:37:47,249
He was on the passenger’s side. Nearest point of impact.

465
00:37:47,393 --> 00:37:49,760
Set up for a chest tube. Cross in time for 4 units.

466
00:37:49,912 --> 00:37:51,443
- He’s a minor?
- Yeah.

467
00:37:51,581 --> 00:37:53,921
- He’s going to need surgery.
- Do whatever you need to do, Doc.

468
00:37:54,013 --> 00:37:55,152
You’re his legal guardian?

469
00:37:58,411 --> 00:37:59,370
He’s my son.

470
00:38:20,695 --> 00:38:23,511
Well, you’ve got a concussion and I’m going to have to close that.

471
00:38:24,842 --> 00:38:26,203
But you’ll be fine.

472
00:38:26,956 --> 00:38:29,644
So, how much have you had to drink today?

473
00:39:06,202 --> 00:39:10,129
Paging Karen Roe. Karen Roe to the nearest white courtesy phone.

474
00:39:19,180 --> 00:39:20,460
This is Karen Roe.
