1
00:00:00,436 --> 00:00:01,742
Previously on One Tree Hill.

2
00:00:01,772 --> 00:00:03,591
Oh, hey Mouth, have you seen Brooke?

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,573
Yeah, she’s um… benefiting with Felix.

4
00:00:08,809 --> 00:00:12,115
My mom ever asks… I got the test and I’m fine.

5
00:00:12,546 --> 00:00:13,524
If that’s what you want.

6
00:00:13,631 --> 00:00:17,865
Yesterday Dan… told me that you slept with Keith. Is it true?

7
00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:19,443
No, of course not.

8
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:22,915
I spent the whole night waiting for you! All while you were with Chris!

9
00:00:22,985 --> 00:00:26,421
- Can we leave him out of this please?! 
- Why? Are you into him?

10
00:00:26,646 --> 00:00:30,651
Just because people say something, doesn’t make it true Felix. Those were rumours!

11
00:00:30,712 --> 00:00:33,184
Yeah? Well how do you think rumours get started?

12
00:00:33,574 --> 00:00:36,323
It’s okay. I already flushed it down the toilet.

13
00:00:36,959 --> 00:00:38,607
I’ve only done it that one time.

14
00:00:38,669 --> 00:00:42,207
You don’t get to have me, not my body and sure as hell not my heart.

15
00:00:42,769 --> 00:00:43,707
We’re done.

16
00:00:44,996 --> 00:00:46,368
We should do this more often.

17
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:47,465
Do what?

18
00:00:47,977 --> 00:00:49,170
Be friends.

19
00:01:39,182 --> 00:01:40,990
Nathanial Hawthorne once wrote:

20
00:01:41,342 --> 00:01:44,369
No man… for any considerable period…

21
00:01:45,255 --> 00:01:47,303
can wear one face to himself…

22
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:49,477
and another to the multitude…

23
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:53,345
without finally getting bewildered as to which may be the true.

24
00:02:23,011 --> 00:02:23,912
Haley!

25
00:02:24,049 --> 00:02:26,933
Hey. I’m sorry to bother you so early…

26
00:02:28,728 --> 00:02:32,007
Nathan and I had a fight last night and he didn’t come home and...

27
00:02:32,108 --> 00:02:33,895
I talked to him. He’s okay.

28
00:02:33,976 --> 00:02:35,885
Oh well, do you know where he is?

29
00:02:36,644 --> 00:02:38,574
- No. 
- Okay, well…

30
00:02:38,663 --> 00:02:41,586
The next time you talk to him, can you… ask him to come home please?

31
00:02:41,939 --> 00:02:43,336
Okay, I will.

32
00:02:43,839 --> 00:02:47,392
Alright, well look, don’t worry yourself, okay Hales? I’m sure he’s fine. Alright?

33
00:02:47,653 --> 00:02:48,497
Okay. Bye.

34
00:02:51,832 --> 00:02:53,214
Thanks for covering for me man.

35
00:02:53,906 --> 00:02:55,190
You’re welcome but it sucked.

36
00:02:55,897 --> 00:02:56,987
I don’t wanna lie to Haley.

37
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,010
You just did.

38
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:03,096
Why don’t you go home? Work it out. It… didn’t sound like Haley was going to school anyway.

39
00:03:03,285 --> 00:03:05,471
Yeah, why would they have the Formal on a Sunday?

40
00:03:05,554 --> 00:03:08,125
I dunno; to keep the students from partying, getting wasted.

41
00:03:08,487 --> 00:03:10,161
Arguing with their wives.

42
00:03:11,088 --> 00:03:12,318
Yeah, well it didn’t work.

43
00:03:14,125 --> 00:03:15,594
How’d it go with Anna anyway?

44
00:03:16,174 --> 00:03:18,841
Well lets just say we didn’t exactly end the night together.

45
00:03:19,106 --> 00:03:20,218
Who’d you end up with?

46
00:03:24,596 --> 00:03:25,804
Only in Tree Hill.

47
00:03:26,531 --> 00:03:28,999
Ew, you two realise you’re related, right?

48
00:03:29,115 --> 00:03:29,827
Hi Brooke.

49
00:03:29,945 --> 00:03:31,819
Double ew if Tutor Wife is here.

50
00:03:31,948 --> 00:03:32,721
She’s not.

51
00:03:33,365 --> 00:03:34,089
What’s up?

52
00:03:34,293 --> 00:03:39,664
Um… my car is now out of commission, thanks to my jealous, spiteful stain of a neighbour…

53
00:03:39,954 --> 00:03:44,230
and I was sort of thinking… that… you might wanna walk to school together.

54
00:03:45,468 --> 00:03:48,051
Unless of course, you’re waiting for your ‘Boytoy’ here.

55
00:03:49,049 --> 00:03:51,547
Go ahead. I’ll catch up with you guys later.

56
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:52,417
Alright.

57
00:03:52,838 --> 00:03:53,728
Go home Nate.

58
00:03:54,302 --> 00:03:55,146
Work it out.

59
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:12,185
Well, well. Angel of the morning.

60
00:04:13,635 --> 00:04:16,562
Okay, look. I wasn’t with Lucas so just… chill out.

61
00:04:20,438 --> 00:04:21,571
Where were you Anna?

62
00:04:23,035 --> 00:04:24,309
I stayed at Peyton’s.

63
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:27,801
Ah, that’s great. Mom and dad will love that!

64
00:04:27,893 --> 00:04:28,949
Then don’t tell them.

65
00:04:29,184 --> 00:04:31,346
Just let me know when I need to start packing again.

66
00:04:44,774 --> 00:04:46,480
New digs for your return, hey Danny?

67
00:04:47,145 --> 00:04:49,628
No, new digs for your return.

68
00:04:50,566 --> 00:04:52,614
You did a hell of a job while I was away Keith.

69
00:04:57,103 --> 00:04:58,205
What do you say?

70
00:05:02,201 --> 00:05:04,257
- Who do you think did it? 
- Felix.

71
00:05:05,275 --> 00:05:08,132
We kind of… stopped benefiting.

72
00:05:10,831 --> 00:05:16,033
I’m glad! I mean, not about the… windshield thing but… about the rest of it.

73
00:05:16,191 --> 00:05:17,890
Why, because you don’t like him?

74
00:05:18,537 --> 00:05:19,177
No…

75
00:05:20,672 --> 00:05:21,976
because you’re better than that.

76
00:05:26,631 --> 00:05:27,941
I miss this, you know.

77
00:05:29,524 --> 00:05:30,655
Talking to you.

78
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:36,825
What happened to you?

79
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:39,815
I’m not talking to you.

80
00:05:40,956 --> 00:05:41,674
Okay.

81
00:05:43,153 --> 00:05:45,315
Well if it makes you feel any better… Brooke dumped me.

82
00:05:47,024 --> 00:05:48,136
You told her didn’t you?

83
00:05:49,241 --> 00:05:50,701
About the dollhouse and TRIC.

84
00:05:51,828 --> 00:05:53,461
Thought she should know the truth.

85
00:05:55,218 --> 00:05:56,632
Whatever, I deserved it.

86
00:05:57,614 --> 00:06:01,249
It’s a rule of life Mouth; whatever crap you pull… always catches up to you.

87
00:06:01,587 --> 00:06:02,615
It’s a part of the game.

88
00:06:03,467 --> 00:06:05,217
It’s not a game, Felix.

89
00:06:05,974 --> 00:06:10,169
Come on Mouth. It took her less than and hour to crush me and hook up with Lucas.

90
00:06:10,388 --> 00:06:12,185
Lucas wouldn’t do that. He’s with Anna.

91
00:06:12,369 --> 00:06:13,147
Really?

92
00:06:18,509 --> 00:06:19,978
It’s okay to freak out, Mouth.

93
00:06:21,533 --> 00:06:22,927
I did last night.

94
00:06:35,865 --> 00:06:36,699
Hi.

95
00:06:39,577 --> 00:06:40,592
Sorry.

96
00:06:42,347 --> 00:06:43,186
I was…

97
00:06:44,416 --> 00:06:46,310
I was wrong last night and…

98
00:06:46,888 --> 00:06:50,014
I found your letter from the camp and I want you to go.


99
00:06:50,118 --> 00:06:53,914
It’s not about the camp, Haley. It’s about trust.

100
00:06:57,475 --> 00:06:59,756
I want you to stop working with Chris.

101
00:07:00,467 --> 00:07:04,557
- He’s incredibly talented, Nathan. 
- I want you to stop seeing him.

102
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:12,556
I won’t do that.

103
00:07:26,456 --> 00:07:28,638
Hey. Wanna hear about my window?

104
00:07:29,554 --> 00:07:32,821
Somebody bashed in my car windshield last night. You believe that?

105
00:07:33,297 --> 00:07:35,033
I mean, could things get any worse?

106
00:07:38,117 --> 00:07:39,533
You wanna ask me that again?

107
00:07:46,228 --> 00:07:48,949
- What’s this? 
- An estimate for my windshield.

108
00:07:51,954 --> 00:07:54,381
- And you think I did it? 
- I know you did.

109
00:07:54,437 --> 00:07:57,084
I didn’t break you window baby… just your heart.

110
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,014
Please.

111
00:08:02,981 --> 00:08:05,840
With men like that in the world, it’s a wonder we’re not gay!

112
00:08:06,997 --> 00:08:08,451
See the way everybody’s looking at me?

113
00:08:09,536 --> 00:08:11,420
Nobody’s taking this seriously.

114
00:08:11,738 --> 00:08:14,708
Really? Because half the girls in P.E. wouldn’t change in front of me.

115
00:08:14,810 --> 00:08:16,812
It’s ‘cause you look better than they do, naked.

116
00:08:19,915 --> 00:08:21,369
Do you have any idea who did it?

117
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:28,874
Well… if you ask me, they did you a favour; boys love lesbians.

118
00:08:30,621 --> 00:08:31,512
Come on.

119
00:08:33,196 --> 00:08:35,388
The old P. Sawyer woulda just rolled with this.

120
00:08:36,243 --> 00:08:38,649
Yeah, well I haven’t been the old P. Sawyer in a while, have I?

121
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:42,264
Hey, your real friends are here for you.

122
00:08:57,092 --> 00:08:58,330
Unbelievable.

123
00:08:58,432 --> 00:09:01,930
Okay, you know what, I’m gonna get outta here. Do you wanna come with me?

124
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:06,882
Yeah… but… I have a quiz next period and if I miss it –

125
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:09,345
Nah it’s… it’s cool. I’ll see ya later.

126
00:09:09,815 --> 00:09:10,845
Okay.

127
00:09:35,202 --> 00:09:38,702
What’s up? Looking for your wife?

128
00:09:39,322 --> 00:09:42,742
You’re funny. You’re also done messing with Haley.

129
00:09:44,432 --> 00:09:48,539
- We’re just rehearsing, man. 
- No, you were rehearsing. That’s over now.

130
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:51,252
Why? Can’t you trust her?

131
00:09:52,531 --> 00:09:54,191
I mean, isn’t that what this is about?

132
00:09:54,729 --> 00:09:57,254
You love her… you married her…

133
00:09:57,965 --> 00:09:59,210
but can you trust her?

134
00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:04,221
Cos if you can, you got nothing to worry about right?

135
00:10:06,214 --> 00:10:07,919
Come on, man, I don’t have a problem with you.

136
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:17,480
You see, you do have a problem with me; a big problem.

137
00:10:17,545 --> 00:10:22,040
You could smile and act cool if you want to but the fact is, man: I used to destroy guys like you.

138
00:10:22,326 --> 00:10:23,212
Daily.

139
00:10:25,051 --> 00:10:28,208
It’d be a shame if something happened to this hand; you couldn’t play that little guitar anymore huh?

140
00:10:28,265 --> 00:10:31,512
Just like it’d be a shame if you were taking advantage of Haley.

141
00:10:37,909 --> 00:10:41,460
Don’t cry, rock star, ruin your make-up.

142
00:10:46,223 --> 00:10:47,274
Pick up.


143
00:10:49,323 --> 00:10:50,574
Pick up.

144
00:10:52,309 --> 00:10:53,953
You’ve reached Sawyer dredging.

145
00:10:54,035 --> 00:10:57,076
If you’d like to leave a message for Larry Sawyer, please do so after –

146
00:11:02,887 --> 00:11:03,767
Hey.

147
00:11:04,393 --> 00:11:05,218
Hey.

148
00:11:05,816 --> 00:11:09,196
So… I saw you cut out of lunch today.

149
00:11:11,479 --> 00:11:14,029
Just… wanted to know how you were doing.

150
00:11:15,805 --> 00:11:16,742
Been better.

151
00:11:21,401 --> 00:11:23,526
Hey. Come here.

152
00:11:29,796 --> 00:11:30,845
Sit down.

153
00:11:40,058 --> 00:11:42,491
So do you know who wrote it? On your locker.

154
00:11:44,267 --> 00:11:51,394
No. I don’t even wanna know. I just want it to all… go away. Just… all of it.

155
00:12:00,428 --> 00:12:01,338
You miss Jake, huh?

156
00:12:04,481 --> 00:12:05,531
You should go.

157
00:12:07,246 --> 00:12:09,596
- Peyton. 
- No– Okay.

158
00:12:09,704 --> 00:12:13,293
You can’t just walk in here and ask me something like that!

159
00:12:13,381 --> 00:12:16,637
When is the last time we even had a conversation about something real?

160
00:12:16,714 --> 00:12:18,310
I just thought you could use a friend.

161
00:12:18,388 --> 00:12:22,464
Yeah, I could use a friend, you know but you don’t qualify as that anymore, Lucas,

162
00:12:22,581 --> 00:12:25,996
because a real friend would know about all the crap I’ve been dealing with lately.

163
00:12:26,284 --> 00:12:27,066
Like what?

164
00:12:30,235 --> 00:12:31,730
Just go. Please.

165
00:12:34,078 --> 00:12:36,558
Okay. I’ll go.

166
00:12:42,287 --> 00:12:43,456
Whatever you think…

167
00:12:45,365 --> 00:12:47,526
I really do care about you, Peyton.

168
00:13:01,222 --> 00:13:03,239
You sneaking away without saying goodbye?

169
00:13:04,355 --> 00:13:06,117
Oh, actually I was…

170
00:13:07,653 --> 00:13:09,046
I was thinking about staying.

171
00:13:10,413 --> 00:13:12,789
Dan offered me a management position at the dealership.

172
00:13:13,787 --> 00:13:15,375
Did you say no to Charleston?

173
00:13:16,356 --> 00:13:19,050
Well, not yet but… I might.

174
00:13:21,386 --> 00:13:23,009
You know I care about you, Keith.

175
00:13:23,797 --> 00:13:24,446
Yeah.

176
00:13:25,229 --> 00:13:26,264
Then listen to me.

177
00:13:26,818 --> 00:13:29,565
I know how much teaching in Charleston means to you.

178
00:13:30,341 --> 00:13:32,824
I’ve seen you light up when you talk about it.

179
00:13:33,023 --> 00:13:35,107
Not as much as I light up when I talk about you.

180
00:13:37,441 --> 00:13:40,359
One of the reasons I fell for you was your independence.

181
00:13:41,789 --> 00:13:43,846
You made your own way in the world.

182
00:13:44,385 --> 00:13:48,199
You brother’s business is his. Charleston is yours.

183
00:13:49,381 --> 00:13:51,107
Don’t let him take that from you.

184
00:14:04,270 --> 00:14:06,923
- Can I give you a piece of advice? 
- Nice to see you too.

185
00:14:06,979 --> 00:14:10,347
Next time you wanna lie about something, you might wanna make sure your mom is in on it.

186
00:14:10,563 --> 00:14:12,627
She told me about Nathan sleeping here last night.

187
00:14:12,826 --> 00:14:16,891
Haley, Nathan just needed some time. If you were here, I’d have done the same thing.

188
00:14:17,127 --> 00:14:18,883
Lucas Eugene Scott!

189
00:14:19,289 --> 00:14:21,554
- Oo, that sounds bad. 
- Eugene?

190
00:14:25,406 --> 00:14:27,720
- Why would you lie to me? 
- Yeah, get in line.

191
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:31,888
- Mom, what are you talking about? 
- Dan’s heart condition. Is it genetic?

192
00:14:33,875 --> 00:14:36,087
- Yes. 
- Why didn’t you tell me?

193
00:14:36,175 --> 00:14:40,172
- What kind of doctor doesn’t call me?! 
- Mom, I told him you were in Florence.

194
00:14:40,249 --> 00:14:43,669
Why?! When there’s a fifty percent chance you have a genetic heart defect!

195
00:14:43,730 --> 00:14:47,448
- Nathan- 
- No, he’s… fine. He doesn’t have it. He took the test.

196
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:48,457
But you didn’t?

197
00:14:49,767 --> 00:14:52,210
- Who told you? 
- You are taking that test.

198
00:14:52,276 --> 00:14:55,666
- No! I’m not. 
- Are you out of your mind?!

199
00:14:55,803 --> 00:15:00,499
How can you be so reckless and cavalier about a potentially fatal condition?

200
00:15:00,567 --> 00:15:01,483
I’m gonna go home.

201
00:15:02,562 --> 00:15:04,626
You’re gonna give me the name of the doctor that you’ve spoken with

202
00:15:04,692 --> 00:15:07,211
and you’re packing a bag because I’m driving you to that test.

203
00:15:07,298 --> 00:15:09,966
No, I'm not taking the test. I don't wanna know!

204
00:15:10,043 --> 00:15:12,116
- Why not?!
- For lots of reasons.

205
00:15:12,372 --> 00:15:15,285
Basketball... the way I wanna live my life.

206
00:15:15,372 --> 00:15:19,274
Lucas, basketball is a game! Now I am glad that you have a talent

207
00:15:19,331 --> 00:15:22,118
but do you really think that I will put a game before your life?

208
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:24,281
- I would. 
- Oh, grow up!

209
00:15:24,405 --> 00:15:28,531
That tragic hero crap only works in the movies and you know what they don't show you after they fade out?

210
00:15:28,613 --> 00:15:30,968
The hero’s mother putting her foot up his ass!

211
00:15:31,265 --> 00:15:34,690
Mom, you can threaten me all you want but you can’t make me take that test.

212
00:15:34,824 --> 00:15:37,737
I sure as hell can! You think about that!

213
00:15:38,622 --> 00:15:41,751
Until you come to your senses, your basketball days are over.

214
00:15:42,559 --> 00:15:43,205
Mom!

215
00:15:44,004 --> 00:15:47,071
You need parental permission to play and you just lost yours.

216
00:15:54,454 --> 00:15:56,638
Hey guys! Let’s jump.

217
00:15:58,190 --> 00:16:00,142
How bout a little two-on-two? Come on.

218
00:16:00,803 --> 00:16:03,081
Luke, I don’t know much man but I do know one thing;

219
00:16:03,685 --> 00:16:05,892
you damn sure aint touching no ball round here.

220
00:16:06,163 --> 00:16:08,489
- Alright, what’s going on? 
- Your mom told us bout your heart.

221
00:16:08,585 --> 00:16:12,353
- She said you’d be in danger if you played. 
- Yeah, we’d be in danger if we let you play.

222
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:13,515
She was scary Luke.

223
00:16:13,751 --> 00:16:14,954
Look guys, I’m fine.

224
00:16:15,170 --> 00:16:18,179
It might be true… but we’ll let your mom tell us that for sure.

225
00:16:19,485 --> 00:16:20,289
Let’s go.

226
00:16:41,743 --> 00:16:42,946
What going on with you?

227
00:16:43,786 --> 00:16:45,780
I heard about you heart test.

228
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:48,215
I’m fine.

229
00:16:48,957 --> 00:16:50,007
Are you sure?

230
00:16:53,364 --> 00:16:55,064
I’m not gonna see Chris anymore.

231
00:16:56,657 --> 00:17:00,364
I don’t want it to come between us. I just-I don’t want anything to come between us.

232
00:17:08,081 --> 00:17:08,812
Lucas.

233
00:17:09,391 --> 00:17:10,998
You told my mom about the heart test.

234
00:17:13,445 --> 00:17:16,445
Well I’m glad she knows. If it forces you to reconsider.

235
00:17:17,066 --> 00:17:18,448
You promised me.

236
00:17:20,736 --> 00:17:21,438
Lucas!

237
00:17:23,870 --> 00:17:25,381
What did you see when you died?

238
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:31,438
After the accident; when your heart stopped. What’d you see?

239
00:17:33,384 --> 00:17:35,385
Because when my heart failed, I saw you.

240
00:17:36,931 --> 00:17:39,051
Your mother can’t bear to lose you, Lucas.

241
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:41,299
Neither can I.

242
00:17:52,926 --> 00:17:54,232
I… I rang the doorbell.

243
00:17:56,721 --> 00:17:57,437
I know.

244
00:17:58,399 --> 00:17:59,527
I just didn’t wanna answer.

245
00:18:02,592 --> 00:18:04,816
I’m sorry I blew you off at lunch today.

246
00:18:05,343 --> 00:18:10,043
You know, it’s really starting to be a pattern; you showing up in my room to apologise to me.

247
00:18:12,218 --> 00:18:14,282
You’re right. But…

248
00:18:19,234 --> 00:18:23,990
At my last school… there were some rumours about me.

249
00:18:24,865 --> 00:18:28,951
About a relationship I was having... with another girl.

250
00:18:32,505 --> 00:18:36,330
I tried to ignore it but the stories just… kept getting worse.

251
00:18:37,333 --> 00:18:39,960
Until, finally, my parents decided to move us here.

252
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:43,713
And that’s why Felix is so protective of me.

253
00:18:44,746 --> 00:18:46,734
He was really happy in our last town.

254
00:18:47,511 --> 00:18:50,784
Okay, but I thought you said they were just… rumours.

255
00:18:51,311 --> 00:18:52,453
It doesn’t matter.

256
00:18:53,313 --> 00:18:54,843
You know how high school is.

257
00:18:56,103 --> 00:19:00,246
Once a story gets out, it… might as well be true.

258
00:19:02,944 --> 00:19:06,743
So when I saw your locker, and the way that people were looking at you,

259
00:19:08,135 --> 00:19:10,511
I guess… it scared me.

260
00:19:13,082 --> 00:19:15,897
It was… a horrible time for me, Peyton.

261
00:19:21,331 --> 00:19:22,481
What are you gonna do?

262
00:19:23,121 --> 00:19:24,007
I don’t know.

263
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:29,733
You could always just… let it go. I mean, you’re not gay. Right?

264
00:19:32,005 --> 00:19:32,777
Come here.

265
00:19:40,003 --> 00:19:40,729
Read that.

266
00:19:43,239 --> 00:19:47,585
First they put away the dealers… then they put away the prostitutes…

267
00:19:48,015 --> 00:19:52,802
then they shoot away the bums… and… beat and bash the queers…

268
00:19:54,605 --> 00:19:58,337
Turned away asylum seekers, fed us suspicions and fears,

269
00:19:58,634 --> 00:20:01,154
we didn’t raise our voice, we didn’t make a fuss…

270
00:20:01,557 --> 00:20:04,957
- it’s funny, there was no one left to notice- 
- when they came for us.

271
00:20:06,883 --> 00:20:09,592
Anna, it’s not about who I am, okay?

272
00:20:09,678 --> 00:20:13,402
It’s about who they are, they are people who hate and they divide

273
00:20:13,468 --> 00:20:16,164
and the feed off of people that don’t fight back.

274
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:22,939
Yeah, I… I could laugh this off. But… what about the girl that can’t?

275
00:20:23,723 --> 00:20:24,849
Who’s gonna help her?

276
00:20:27,118 --> 00:20:29,426
Silence only makes them stronger.

277
00:21:11,201 --> 00:21:12,230
Hey, Haley.

278
00:21:13,204 --> 00:21:14,289
You here to see Chris?

279
00:21:21,615 --> 00:21:22,839
Oh, sorry. Um…

280
00:21:24,483 --> 00:21:28,257
You know what, I’ll… I’ll catch him later. It’s okay.

281
00:21:47,671 --> 00:21:48,403
Keith?

282
00:21:49,305 --> 00:21:50,015
Hey.

283
00:21:51,470 --> 00:21:55,735
I… I accepted Dan’s offer.

284
00:21:58,295 --> 00:22:04,578
You know, Charleston was always about… hope for me, Jules;

285
00:22:05,355 --> 00:22:07,986
a place where maybe I could… find something special.

286
00:22:09,052 --> 00:22:10,415
But I found that right here.

287
00:22:13,328 --> 00:22:14,156
With you.

288
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:18,914
You’ve given me that hope.

289
00:22:25,837 --> 00:22:27,331
You are the best.

290
00:22:28,013 --> 00:22:29,007
What do I owe you?

291
00:22:29,968 --> 00:22:30,685
Nothing.

292
00:22:31,448 --> 00:22:32,820
I called in a couple of favours.

293
00:22:33,357 --> 00:22:35,048
Are you serious? Thank you.

294
00:22:35,138 --> 00:22:37,704
- Hi Brooke! 
- Hi.

295
00:22:38,447 --> 00:22:39,025
Hey.

296
00:22:40,093 --> 00:22:40,910
You ready?

297
00:22:41,478 --> 00:22:42,149
Yeah.

298
00:22:42,349 --> 00:22:43,501
Okay. Bye.

299
00:22:45,062 --> 00:22:46,946
Um… so…

300
00:22:47,356 --> 00:22:50,028
I guess I’ll… see you at school.

301
00:22:50,905 --> 00:22:51,892
Yeah.

302
00:23:32,079 --> 00:23:34,031
Hey, Luke! Can I talk to you?

303
00:23:41,085 --> 00:23:43,057
I heard that you fixed Brooke’s windshield.

304
00:23:43,138 --> 00:23:44,481
Yeah, you know, she needed some help.

305
00:23:44,659 --> 00:23:47,163
Well I wanna pay for it. I took some money out of the bank.

306
00:23:47,517 --> 00:23:50,850
- Mouth, you don’t have to do that, alright? 
- Please! I want to.

307
00:23:51,337 --> 00:23:53,287
- Mouth...
- I’m the one who did it.

308
00:23:55,504 --> 00:23:57,101
I broke her windshield.

309
00:24:03,071 --> 00:24:08,729
Miss Sawyer, you know we have a policy regarding wardrobe that’s offensive or profane.

310
00:24:09,205 --> 00:24:12,989
Does that policy extend to lockers, cos you haven’t removed that yet have you?

311
00:24:13,485 --> 00:24:17,279
You know the drill; go to the office and change or be sent home.

312
00:24:18,447 --> 00:24:21,491
Okay, Mr Turner, have you ever heard of Victor Hara?

313
00:24:22,656 --> 00:24:27,044
No? Um… he was this musician, right, and he fought in justice with his songs

314
00:24:27,105 --> 00:24:30,684
and when they broke his hands and when they taunted him, he just sang even louder.

315
00:24:30,805 --> 00:24:35,184
Look, Peyton, oppression’s not exactly a mystery to me, okay?

316
00:24:36,275 --> 00:24:38,896
- I feel your pain. 
- No… no you don’t.

317
00:24:38,994 --> 00:24:42,619
Okay, I’m sorry, but you don’t know anything about my pain.

318
00:24:42,767 --> 00:24:47,017
Maybe so but there are counsellors you can talk to. Literature you can read.

319
00:24:47,093 --> 00:24:49,664
Okay, I’m not gay! Mr Turner.

320
00:24:49,834 --> 00:24:53,827
But you know what; if I was I wouldn’t let other people tear me down because of it

321
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:57,769
and I sure as hell wouldn't be looking for my answers in-in one of your pamphlets!

322
00:24:58,584 --> 00:25:02,864
Policy is clear Peyton. Remove the shirt or be suspended.

323
00:25:06,274 --> 00:25:07,010
Fine.

324
00:25:09,509 --> 00:25:11,788
Can you hear my song now, Mr Turner?

325
00:25:15,408 --> 00:25:17,425
Enjoy your suspension Miss Sawyer.

326
00:25:27,046 --> 00:25:28,627
You probably think I’m an idiot.

327
00:25:29,323 --> 00:25:31,755
Actually, I’m kinda hoping you have an evil twin.

328
00:25:31,950 --> 00:25:33,697
Look, vandalising Brooke’s car…

329
00:25:34,285 --> 00:25:35,631
Mouth, that’s just not you.

330
00:25:36,149 --> 00:25:37,624
I guess that’s why I did it.

331
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:41,186
Girls see me as their little brother.

332
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:43,204
They always tell me how nice I am.

333
00:25:43,311 --> 00:25:44,679
Well that’s cos you are nice!

334
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:47,146
That’s why you have so many friends, Mouth.

335
00:25:47,214 --> 00:25:48,407
And no girlfriend.

336
00:25:49,272 --> 00:25:51,508
Haley fell for Nathan when he was a jerk.

337
00:25:51,734 --> 00:25:53,172
Brooke went for Felix.

338
00:25:53,292 --> 00:25:56,649
Luke, you’ve screwed up a lot this year and you’ve had a different girl every week.

339
00:25:58,396 --> 00:26:00,909
Sorry. I just…

340
00:26:01,462 --> 00:26:03,234
I try to be honest with Brooke.

341
00:26:03,925 --> 00:26:07,095
I told her the truth and then she left with Felix anyway.

342
00:26:07,176 --> 00:26:08,924
Yeah, to end things with him.

343
00:26:09,152 --> 00:26:10,816
But I didn’t know that at the time.

344
00:26:11,999 --> 00:26:16,904
All I knew was that I was at another party where… everybody had someone, but me.

345
00:26:19,111 --> 00:26:21,937
Then I… kinda got drunk.

346
00:26:22,168 --> 00:26:23,263
You were drinking?

347
00:26:23,611 --> 00:26:24,580
Sort of.

348
00:26:25,501 --> 00:26:27,268
I had… one drink.

349
00:26:28,036 --> 00:26:29,381
But it was a big one.

350
00:26:29,822 --> 00:26:31,716
Next thing I knew, I was at Brooke’s house.

351
00:26:31,830 --> 00:26:33,919
Wait, you drove to Brooke’s house… wasted?

352
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:35,183
I rode my bike.

353
00:26:36,038 --> 00:26:37,774
I… fell a couple of times.

354
00:26:39,804 --> 00:26:44,864
In the morning, I felt terrible about what I did and even worse when I found out you fixed it.

355
00:26:46,867 --> 00:26:48,578
You know she thinks Felix did it.

356
00:26:49,186 --> 00:26:52,269
I know… and I’m gonna tell her the truth.

357
00:26:55,417 --> 00:26:58,095
You know, I like Brooke a lot.

358
00:26:59,466 --> 00:27:01,402
I guess I have for a long time.

359
00:27:03,265 --> 00:27:05,463
But it was okay when you guys were together.

360
00:27:07,182 --> 00:27:09,677
I guess I always thought your hearts were the same.

361
00:27:29,333 --> 00:27:32,854
Hey! Hang on a second!

362
00:27:34,094 --> 00:27:35,205
What is this!?

363
00:27:36,981 --> 00:27:39,779
- That should cover your window. 
- Then you did do it.

364
00:27:39,849 --> 00:27:41,412
No. I didn’t.

365
00:27:47,007 --> 00:27:49,613
- Who’s the ho? 
- She not a ho.

366
00:27:49,772 --> 00:27:51,877
Her name’s Kayla and she was my last girlfriend.

367
00:27:53,463 --> 00:27:56,484
We dated for two years. I was never happier.

368
00:27:58,477 --> 00:28:02,014
Then, one day… she passed me a note… and that was it.

369
00:28:02,382 --> 00:28:05,546
I don’t believe you. Cos you said you only do ‘Friends with Benefits’.

370
00:28:05,726 --> 00:28:06,986
I have, since then.

371
00:28:07,963 --> 00:28:09,331
See, I was just like you Brooke.

372
00:28:10,513 --> 00:28:14,068
Doing ‘Friends with Benefits’ because I was afraid of getting my heart broken again.

373
00:28:16,419 --> 00:28:17,856
But I guess it doesn’t matter.

374
00:28:24,225 --> 00:28:27,974
So what, I’m supposed to believe you didn’t break my windshield but you’re paying for it anyway?

375
00:28:29,197 --> 00:28:32,182
You don’t have to believe it. Any of it.

376
00:28:34,445 --> 00:28:35,509
But it’s true.

377
00:28:49,926 --> 00:28:50,854
What’s with them?

378
00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:54,459
Oh, huh, Dan told my mom about the HCM test.

379
00:28:54,906 --> 00:28:57,296
I guess that’s my bad for trusting him to keep a secret right?

380
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:59,588
He didn’t tell her.

381
00:29:01,827 --> 00:29:02,686
I did.

382
00:29:04,222 --> 00:29:04,976
I told her.

383
00:29:05,799 --> 00:29:06,737
Why?

384
00:29:07,147 --> 00:29:10,198
Because I knew that if she found out, she’d make you take the test.

385
00:29:10,295 --> 00:29:13,254
She’s not gonna make me take the test and that sucks that you told her!

386
00:29:13,766 --> 00:29:15,411
After I covered for you with Haley!

387
00:29:15,513 --> 00:29:18,063
About where I crashed for a night, not about my life.

388
00:29:18,171 --> 00:29:20,419
You know what, whatever. You promised me.

389
00:29:20,971 --> 00:29:23,035
Guess Dan’s not the only one I can’t trust.

390
00:29:24,601 --> 00:29:26,096
Hey, yo, Luke. He’s right, man.

391
00:29:26,824 --> 00:29:28,927
I mean you’re wrong not to take that test, dawg.

392
00:29:29,870 --> 00:29:32,102
Come on man, it’s not fair to us or your mom.

393
00:29:32,879 --> 00:29:33,792
Unbelievable.

394
00:29:34,867 --> 00:29:38,548
You know what, Skills, why don’t you just run with Nathan from now on.

395
00:29:39,136 --> 00:29:41,452
How bout you take the test and we all run together?

396
00:29:57,425 --> 00:29:59,033
- Hey. 
- Hey!

397
00:29:59,284 --> 00:30:02,193
Um… I was gonna call you… in a while.

398
00:30:02,367 --> 00:30:06,313
Um… I’m sorry to just drop by. I just need somebody to talk to.

399
00:30:06,395 --> 00:30:07,097
Stop!

400
00:30:08,004 --> 00:30:09,980
I just-I need you, Brooke.

401
00:30:11,593 --> 00:30:17,861
I just… there’s so much stuff piling up and I don’t think I can handle it anymore.

402
00:30:17,932 --> 00:30:19,862
Okay. Well what’s going on? Talk to me,

403
00:30:19,979 --> 00:30:22,647
I mean… you said you’re not feeling like yourself but what’s wrong?

404
00:30:22,759 --> 00:30:23,794
Just everything!

405
00:30:24,490 --> 00:30:28,669
You know, like Karen is really counting on me at the club and I don’t even have a band!

406
00:30:28,848 --> 00:30:32,708
You know, and I’m suspended and that’s gonna look great on my transcripts and...

407
00:30:35,567 --> 00:30:40,864
and I miss Jake and… Jenny… and my mom.

408
00:30:40,966 --> 00:30:43,475
Hey. It’s gonna be okay.

409
00:30:43,583 --> 00:30:47,556
I should be stronger than this, you know, I should and I don’t wanna be a person that…

410
00:30:47,623 --> 00:30:51,846
that needs help but I… I feel all alone.

411
00:30:52,722 --> 00:30:54,576
You are not alone.

412
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:58,241
Okay, you have me no matter what.

413
00:30:59,423 --> 00:31:00,602
Come here.

414
00:31:01,676 --> 00:31:05,793
Oh, I’m just glad you’re not seeing Felix anymore, I missed you.

415
00:31:06,535 --> 00:31:09,481
Um… yeah, I...

416
00:31:11,993 --> 00:31:13,785
Oh. Hey.

417
00:31:15,353 --> 00:31:17,088
- Oh god, um… 
- No, no.

418
00:31:17,155 --> 00:31:20,079
- No, I’m sorry to interrupt. 
- No, Peyton. Don’t go.

419
00:31:20,185 --> 00:31:22,849
- It’s cool, I’ll call you later. 
- No! Peyton!

420
00:31:29,041 --> 00:31:30,244
I’ll let you know


421
00:31:31,441 --> 00:31:34,144
When it comes

422
00:31:34,752 --> 00:31:37,262
When it comes

423
00:31:37,931 --> 00:31:40,173
I’ll let you know

424
00:31:40,845 --> 00:31:44,414
But don’t stay up for me, no

425
00:31:45,115 --> 00:31:47,056
Don’t wait up for me

426
00:31:48,015 --> 00:31:50,056
- Hey.
- Hey.

427
00:31:50,257 --> 00:31:51,177
Sounds good.

428
00:31:51,875 --> 00:31:54,244
Thanks. It’s getting there, you know.

429
00:31:55,208 --> 00:31:57,312
Uh, listen. I…

430
00:31:58,227 --> 00:32:00,993
I hope you know how much I appreciate everything that you’ve done for me.

431
00:32:04,043 --> 00:32:08,017
Um… but I don’t… really think we should work together… anymore.

432
00:32:08,857 --> 00:32:10,890
So it got to you? Nathan.

433
00:32:11,243 --> 00:32:14,489
No, I just, I think it’s for the best. You know?

434
00:32:16,358 --> 00:32:18,769
Well… it’s just as well.

435
00:32:19,420 --> 00:32:25,360
You know those… labels from New York? They offered me a… showcase.

436
00:32:25,698 --> 00:32:27,018
I think I’m gonna take it.

437
00:32:27,504 --> 00:32:29,302
Wow, that’s great Chris.

438
00:32:29,410 --> 00:32:34,370
Yeah. I’m leaving tonight, so I won’t be able to… play the show at TRIC anyway.

439
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:38,600
So… I guess this is goodbye.

440
00:32:45,182 --> 00:32:46,090
Thanks.

441
00:32:49,426 --> 00:32:50,827
Wait, Haley, come here.

442
00:33:00,493 --> 00:33:01,763
What are you doing?

443
00:33:02,828 --> 00:33:03,755
Haley.

444
00:33:04,358 --> 00:33:07,015
Is that what this was all about; you just hitting on me?

445
00:33:07,206 --> 00:33:09,202
- Haley, it’s okay. 
- No, it’s not okay.

446
00:33:09,305 --> 00:33:11,558
I can’t believe- you just did that.

447
00:33:12,351 --> 00:33:13,758
Come with me to New York.

448
00:33:14,154 --> 00:33:18,275
What!? In case you missed something: I’m married.

449
00:33:18,382 --> 00:33:21,429
So you made a mistake. Are you gonna let that keep you from the rest of your life, Haley?

450
00:33:21,490 --> 00:33:24,418
- I did not make a mistake! 
- Haley, you owe it to your music.

451
00:33:24,486 --> 00:33:28,254
You owe it to yourself. Your dreams are a bus ride away.

452
00:33:28,766 --> 00:33:30,439
I know you want this Haley.

453
00:33:33,613 --> 00:33:37,047
No, you’re wrong, I don’t. I don’t want it; I don’t want any of it.

454
00:33:38,048 --> 00:33:39,688
It was always there between us, Haley.

455
00:33:41,715 --> 00:33:43,281
Whether you admit it or not.

456
00:34:01,904 --> 00:34:03,546
You cancelling your club night?

457
00:34:03,956 --> 00:34:04,699
Yeah.

458
00:34:06,118 --> 00:34:07,294
Because of the rumours?

459
00:34:07,822 --> 00:34:09,573
Because I can’t sing and dance.

460
00:34:11,659 --> 00:34:13,987
You know what, I’d really rather be alone right now.

461
00:34:16,357 --> 00:34:17,161
Okay.

462
00:34:18,016 --> 00:34:22,634
But… I just wanted to tell you how inspired I was when I saw you at school today.

463
00:34:22,716 --> 00:34:25,342
You know what, Anna, that’s great! You were inspired,

464
00:34:25,419 --> 00:34:29,919
but when I needed you to stand by me, you blew me off! So I don’t need you here now!

465
00:34:50,208 --> 00:34:52,603
Hey, Rick, it’s uh… Peyton.

466
00:35:00,359 --> 00:35:01,742
Hey man, come on in.

467
00:35:02,555 --> 00:35:03,775
Is this my apology?

468
00:35:04,051 --> 00:35:06,641
No, this is Haley’s apology. I don’t owe you one.

469
00:35:06,927 --> 00:35:10,598
You know why? Because nobody wants to lose you, Luke;

470
00:35:10,845 --> 00:35:14,506
not your mom, not Keith… not Haley, not me.

471
00:35:15,971 --> 00:35:17,782
There’s nothing wrong with my heart, Nate.

472
00:35:17,952 --> 00:35:20,562
Yeah? That’s what you said after you car accident.

473
00:35:21,171 --> 00:35:23,460
You told me you didn’t wanna be afraid to live your life.

474
00:35:23,610 --> 00:35:25,504
- That’s right. 
- Well I don’t buy it, Luke.

475
00:35:25,586 --> 00:35:27,701
I think there’s something in your heart you’re running from.

476
00:35:28,222 --> 00:35:29,364
Okay, what are you: psychic?

477
00:35:29,681 --> 00:35:31,418
You can make jokes about it all you want

478
00:35:32,365 --> 00:35:34,279
but you know there’s a girl you had feelings for.

479
00:35:35,272 --> 00:35:38,068
- Nathan- 
- Look me in the eye. Tell me I’m wrong.

480
00:35:40,562 --> 00:35:41,325
See?

481
00:35:42,410 --> 00:35:45,703
Now you can be mad at me all you want; you can say your heart’s fine…

482
00:35:46,208 --> 00:35:50,735
but till you tell this girl how you feel… your heart’s gonna be flawed.

483
00:35:53,147 --> 00:35:54,325
You need to talk to her Luke.

484
00:36:16,749 --> 00:36:20,585
Peyton, it’s me. Will you call me back; I’m worried about you, okay?

485
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:24,165
She’ll be okay.

486
00:36:25,302 --> 00:36:26,351
You can go.

487
00:36:27,267 --> 00:36:28,281
Do I have to?

488
00:36:28,665 --> 00:36:29,812
- Felix! 
- Brooke.

489
00:36:30,355 --> 00:36:31,125
Come on!

490
00:36:31,645 --> 00:36:33,611
Can I just say what I tried to say at the Formal?

491
00:36:33,717 --> 00:36:35,567
- I really wish you- 
- I wanna be with you.

492
00:36:36,734 --> 00:36:37,712
Wouldn’t.

493
00:36:37,824 --> 00:36:40,671
I know it was wrong to lie to you about taking you home after TRIC

494
00:36:41,209 --> 00:36:43,087
but when you looked at me the way you did,

495
00:36:44,399 --> 00:36:46,973
it felt so good to be looked at like that again.

496
00:36:47,983 --> 00:36:49,662
Like you saw the real me.

497
00:36:50,707 --> 00:36:52,161
And you liked what you saw.

498
00:36:55,061 --> 00:36:56,651
You can’t do this to me.

499
00:36:56,967 --> 00:36:58,346
I can’t not do it…

500
00:36:59,385 --> 00:37:01,332
because I’m tired of hiding from it.

501
00:37:03,185 --> 00:37:04,433
I just want you to know...

502
00:37:05,914 --> 00:37:07,695
I never once took you for granted.

503
00:37:09,605 --> 00:37:10,701
Not for a second.

504
00:37:23,309 --> 00:37:24,992
Deb. Come in.

505
00:37:31,559 --> 00:37:32,507
I lied to you.

506
00:37:35,364 --> 00:37:36,534
I slept with Keith.

507
00:37:40,358 --> 00:37:43,499
Hey Jules, its Keith. Um…

508
00:37:45,415 --> 00:37:47,874
I’m sorry to leave this on your machine but…

509
00:37:48,789 --> 00:37:51,288
I just realised something and I had to say it;

510
00:37:53,156 --> 00:37:54,169
I love you.

511
00:37:55,788 --> 00:37:56,632
Call me.

512
00:38:07,062 --> 00:38:08,532
Nice work, Jules.

513
00:38:10,963 --> 00:38:12,422
Just like we planned.

514
00:38:38,433 --> 00:38:39,273
Hey.

515
00:38:40,926 --> 00:38:42,551
I’m sorry about this. I…

516
00:38:43,574 --> 00:38:45,201
I just… I had to see you.

517
00:38:45,996 --> 00:38:47,927
Lucas, what’s wrong?

518
00:38:49,159 --> 00:38:51,863
You know how much I care about you, Anna?

519
00:38:52,974 --> 00:38:54,135
Because I do.

520
00:38:56,736 --> 00:38:58,330
But there’s somebody else.

521
00:39:01,712 --> 00:39:05,303
And she’s a part of my history that… came before you…

522
00:39:07,238 --> 00:39:10,398
and I’ve been lying to myself about the way I feel about her…

523
00:39:13,987 --> 00:39:15,922
and I need to see her tonight.

524
00:39:18,509 --> 00:39:20,380
Cos I feel like she’s slipping away.

525
00:39:22,947 --> 00:39:25,359
I’m sorry… Anna.

526
00:39:36,459 --> 00:39:37,482
Looking for me?

527
00:39:40,048 --> 00:39:41,394
High school girls.

528
00:39:42,504 --> 00:39:43,427
Relax.

529
00:39:45,808 --> 00:39:47,056
Is this what you’re after?

530
00:39:52,381 --> 00:39:53,697
Got some cash for me?

531
00:40:02,504 --> 00:40:03,779
You know this guy?

532
00:40:12,438 --> 00:40:13,415
Jake.

533
00:40:58,661 --> 00:40:59,843
I knew you’d come.

534
00:41:01,354 --> 00:41:02,177
I…

535
00:41:04,056 --> 00:41:09,756
I was on my way home to Nathan and I just… ended up here.

536
00:41:10,753 --> 00:41:14,378
Number 42 now departing for New York City; gate 5.

537
00:41:20,821 --> 00:41:21,855
You ready?

538
00:41:27,052 --> 00:41:28,245
Brooke, talk to me.

539
00:41:30,211 --> 00:41:32,345
Just… just tell me how you feel.

540
00:41:40,258 --> 00:41:41,755
I know it’s scary…

541
00:41:42,835 --> 00:41:44,730
and I know you had a tough time with Lucas…

542
00:41:46,744 --> 00:41:48,975
but just tell me if you can show me your heart.

543
00:41:49,857 --> 00:41:52,886
Because if you do, I’ll guard it with my life.

544
00:41:57,828 --> 00:41:59,108
Just say okay.

545
00:42:02,487 --> 00:42:03,414
Okay.

546
00:42:10,018 --> 00:42:10,918
Okay.

547
00:42:37,241 --> 00:42:41,194
