1
00:00:55,257 --> 00:00:56,629
Luke, Luke, what up dawg?

2
00:00:57,013 --> 00:00:59,691
Check this out. You shoot this one. See what you got.

3
00:01:02,711 --> 00:01:04,606
- Come on, lets move!
- Time to go, baby.

4
00:01:04,745 --> 00:01:05,815
Six-thirty, Luke!

5
00:01:06,132 --> 00:01:08,820
Oh, come on guys, you don’t gotta come. It’s just a game.

6
00:01:09,204 --> 00:01:11,733
Right. Whitey asked you to play on the team.

7
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:12,859
And Nathan threatens you.

8
00:01:12,927 --> 00:01:15,390
You beat him right here one on one, you join the team.

9
00:01:15,486 --> 00:01:17,442
And now it’s the first game and we aint gotta come?

10
00:01:17,525 --> 00:01:21,190
We goin’. This game is for all of us.

11
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:24,740
Go Luke!

12
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:32,520
Karen! You ready to go?

13
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:37,460
Oh. I’m not going. I decided to stay open. I could use the business.

14
00:01:38,128 --> 00:01:41,143
- You talk to Luke about this?
- No. But he’ll understand.

15
00:01:41,675 --> 00:01:43,304
- Karen...
- She doesn’t want to go.

16
00:01:43,375 --> 00:01:46,222
She doesn’t want to see her high school sweetheart slash your brother Dan slash the jerk

17
00:01:46,304 --> 00:01:49,480
who abandoned Lucas slash the father of Nathan, the team's star player slash my wrists

18
00:01:49,616 --> 00:01:51,466
if I hear this story again. Lets go.

19
00:01:52,218 --> 00:01:53,410
I think you’re making a mistake.

20
00:01:59,298 --> 00:02:03,036
Whitey can put this kid on the team, he can put him in the game, but he can’t put him in your game.

21
00:02:03,246 --> 00:02:05,360
So shut him out. And shut down the opposition.

22
00:02:05,602 --> 00:02:07,337
You’ve got Broner tonight. They’re good so be ready.

23
00:02:07,732 --> 00:02:08,370
Alright.

24
00:02:28,344 --> 00:02:29,114
Scott!

25
00:02:41,447 --> 00:02:43,531
I can’t believe the bastard spawn’s on our team.

26
00:02:45,149 --> 00:02:46,051
For now…

27
00:02:48,978 --> 00:02:49,716
You nervous?

28
00:02:50,402 --> 00:02:53,347
- A little bit.
- Good. You ought to be.

29
00:02:55,716 --> 00:02:58,666
Just do what you’ve been doing all week in practice. You’ll be fine.

30
00:03:04,318 --> 00:03:06,965
Luke! You mind if we get a few words before your first game?

31
00:03:07,031 --> 00:03:10,636
Yeah. We’re going to put it on the internet. Ravenshoops.com.

32
00:03:10,702 --> 00:03:12,598
Yeah. We’re going to have a web cast and everything.

33
00:03:12,909 --> 00:03:14,000
What the hell is this?

34
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:18,009
- Well, we have this website.
- Yeah, we’re sports announcers.

35
00:03:18,075 --> 00:03:22,498
Not in here, you’re not. The locker room’s closed. No… media.

36
00:03:23,344 --> 00:03:25,643
Dude, did you hear that? We’re media.

37
00:03:25,967 --> 00:03:28,599
Not just media. Banned media.

38
00:03:32,244 --> 00:03:34,275
They don’t wanna what! Or we’re gonna what!

39
00:03:34,388 --> 00:03:36,790
- Or what! Or what! 
- Alright. Lets take the court.

40
00:03:36,928 --> 00:03:42,565
Ravens! Ravens! Ravens!

41
00:03:42,708 --> 00:03:45,294
Want my world? You’ve got it.

42
00:03:51,233 --> 00:03:54,638
Keith! Hey. Finally came to see your nephew play, huh, big brother?

43
00:03:55,237 --> 00:03:56,968
Yeah. I guess you can say that.

44
00:04:04,099 --> 00:04:06,768
Tonight, Lucas Scott plays his first game for the Tree Hill Ravens.

45
00:04:06,844 --> 00:04:09,127
That’s right, Mouth. Now, the Ravens are 5 and O.

46
00:04:09,228 --> 00:04:12,542
But this is their first game following the suspension of six varsity players.

47
00:04:14,934 --> 00:04:15,645
Son!

48
00:04:25,856 --> 00:04:26,536
Wake up.

49
00:04:28,917 --> 00:04:30,247
All right, come on in.

50
00:04:30,868 --> 00:04:31,953
Hustle, hustle!

51
00:04:32,706 --> 00:04:34,242
So that’s the boy that beat Nathan?

52
00:04:35,962 --> 00:04:37,323
Well, he’s good from behind.

53
00:04:37,589 --> 00:04:39,417
Ravens on three. One! Two! Three!

54
00:04:41,421 --> 00:04:46,365
Luke, relax. Destiny has a way of finding you.

55
00:04:59,292 --> 00:05:00,363
Come on, Nathan.

56
00:05:00,815 --> 00:05:02,115
- Lets go.
- Come on.

57
00:05:07,010 --> 00:05:07,758
Nice hands.

58
00:05:08,326 --> 00:05:09,114
Nice legs.

59
00:05:16,554 --> 00:05:17,568
Lets see some game!

60
00:05:27,117 --> 00:05:28,352
Hey, which side you on?

61
00:05:30,373 --> 00:05:31,434
Go Ravens!

62
00:05:49,363 --> 00:05:50,198
Go Nathan.

63
00:05:51,647 --> 00:05:52,400
Out!

64
00:05:53,818 --> 00:05:54,670
Good.

65
00:05:56,231 --> 00:05:57,704
It’s not your night, son.

66
00:06:02,481 --> 00:06:04,642
Start taking notes, punk.

67
00:07:14,038 --> 00:07:16,118
What? I’m sorry, I’m sorry.

68
00:07:16,559 --> 00:07:17,903
Hey, I’m sorry.

69
00:07:26,516 --> 00:07:27,992
- Unbelievable.
- What?

70
00:07:28,272 --> 00:07:30,750
- Peyton, did you see how bad he sucked?
- So?

71
00:07:30,801 --> 00:07:33,531
He was horrible. I’ve never seen a guy play so bad.

72
00:07:33,593 --> 00:07:34,479
And you enjoyed that?

73
00:07:35,276 --> 00:07:36,976
Well, hell yeah. Didn’t you?

74
00:07:39,936 --> 00:07:41,860
What is this, Peyton? Do you like this guy or something?

75
00:07:42,332 --> 00:07:45,209
You mean more than my boyfriend who I’m trying to make out with right now?

76
00:07:45,302 --> 00:07:46,402
Well go put some ice on it.

77
00:07:46,848 --> 00:07:48,215
You ever think I might want to talk?

78
00:07:49,261 --> 00:07:52,214
No, you don’t. You want to celebrate a public humiliation

79
00:07:52,285 --> 00:07:53,919
and I’m sorry, that’s a little played out.

80
00:07:54,251 --> 00:07:56,435
Oh and being with you isn’t?

81
00:08:00,513 --> 00:08:03,027
Oh, Peyton, come on, I was joking.

82
00:08:09,232 --> 00:08:10,287
Are you getting in the car?

83
00:08:11,506 --> 00:08:12,469
Please?

84
00:08:15,689 --> 00:08:16,334
Fine.

85
00:08:19,022 --> 00:08:21,561
Take your lame music too. And have a nice walk home.

86
00:08:25,535 --> 00:08:28,945
Damnit, Nathan! That CD was hard to find.

87
00:08:29,616 --> 00:08:30,813
It’s an import.

88
00:08:33,982 --> 00:08:34,858
It’s open.

89
00:08:38,398 --> 00:08:40,408
- Hey.
- Is he okay?

90
00:08:41,562 --> 00:08:43,266
I don’t know. I didn’t see him afterward.

91
00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:47,500
You should’ve been there.

92
00:08:48,831 --> 00:08:50,460
Well, you shouldn’t have gone to Whitey.

93
00:08:51,468 --> 00:08:54,136
- I thought you supported this.
- I support Lucas.

94
00:08:54,625 --> 00:08:57,606
I didn’t have much of a choice after you went and got him on the team, did I?

95
00:08:58,872 --> 00:09:00,034
What’s going on?

96
00:09:02,818 --> 00:09:03,966
I should’ve been there.

97
00:09:06,916 --> 00:09:08,922
I thought I was over it, Keith, I really did.

98
00:09:09,363 --> 00:09:10,919
Maybe I’ve just been hiding.

99
00:09:12,753 --> 00:09:14,764
Just, I can’t go back there.

100
00:09:18,876 --> 00:09:20,330
The  place knows too much.

101
00:09:34,006 --> 00:09:35,854
I guess misery really does love company.

102
00:09:38,292 --> 00:09:39,437
What are you doing here?

103
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:40,959
Actually, I’m not here.

104
00:09:41,726 --> 00:09:43,160
I was never here.

105
00:09:45,023 --> 00:09:47,880
You know, I shoot the ball and it goes in.

106
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,396
I don’t ask questions, I don’t think about it.

107
00:09:52,924 --> 00:09:54,229
It’s just the way it is.

108
00:09:55,248 --> 00:09:56,441
Or the way it was.

109
00:09:58,202 --> 00:09:58,914
Yeah.

110
00:09:59,616 --> 00:10:00,870
Lucas,  it’s just a game.

111
00:10:01,567 --> 00:10:04,126
Who cares if the entire school, most of your friends

112
00:10:04,203 --> 00:10:06,819
and half the town saw you suck.

113
00:10:07,972 --> 00:10:09,933
So… you’ve clearly come to cheer me up.

114
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,079
Want a ride?

115
00:10:39,044 --> 00:10:39,889
Nathan!

116
00:10:42,594 --> 00:10:43,423
Look at this.

117
00:10:44,692 --> 00:10:45,743
What did you do there?

118
00:10:48,752 --> 00:10:50,657
I was double teamed, so I found the open man.

119
00:10:50,846 --> 00:10:53,196
Wrong. You gave up a scoring opportunity in the post.

120
00:10:53,294 --> 00:10:56,038
What? Dad, I was double teamed. I scored 28 points.

121
00:10:56,115 --> 00:10:58,123
30 points would’ve looked better to the scouts, don’t you think?

122
00:10:59,751 --> 00:11:03,248
Go to sleep. You look winded in the fourth quarter. We’ll go for a run together in the morning.

123
00:11:05,685 --> 00:11:07,933
You wonder why Mom extends those business trips.

124
00:11:14,522 --> 00:11:16,181
Look, you mind if I ask you a question?

125
00:11:16,661 --> 00:11:17,317
Shoot.

126
00:11:17,753 --> 00:11:20,145
Why’d you decide to do it? Join the team?

127
00:11:20,917 --> 00:11:22,739
‘Cause you don’t exactly fit in here, do you?

128
00:11:23,847 --> 00:11:26,518
The game, I guess. I love the game.

129
00:11:26,666 --> 00:11:29,764
Right. The same reason I cheer. It’s all a big game.

130
00:11:30,695 --> 00:11:34,214
Why not just stay on the playground? Why join the varsity?

131
00:11:35,032 --> 00:11:37,087
Because I want to know if I’m good.

132
00:11:40,256 --> 00:11:43,153
Well, if you ask my opinion, we all just wasted a perfectly good evening.

133
00:11:43,972 --> 00:11:46,948
You, me, and everybody else in there.

134
00:11:48,836 --> 00:11:50,070
Then why do you do it?

135
00:11:52,298 --> 00:11:54,198
I mean, do you really like it or not?

136
00:11:54,945 --> 00:11:57,811
If I say that I liked it, then I’m just another cheerleader.

137
00:11:58,088 --> 00:12:03,321
But if I say that I hate it, then I’m either a liar or a fraud.

138
00:12:04,125 --> 00:12:05,513
Either way I lose.

139
00:12:11,303 --> 00:12:12,435
Do you want to come in?

140
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:14,979
What about Nathan?

141
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:16,768
What about him?

142
00:12:36,581 --> 00:12:37,487
What are you doing?

143
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:41,527
- You just said...
- I didn’t invite you to come in.

144
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,640
I asked if you wanted to.

145
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:45,830
Thanks for the ride.

146
00:12:59,000 --> 00:12:59,890
Hi honey.

147
00:13:01,392 --> 00:13:02,365
I looked for you.

148
00:13:02,569 --> 00:13:06,318
Yeah, we were busy at the café. Which is a good thing, right?

149
00:13:06,574 --> 00:13:07,294
Sure.

150
00:13:07,992 --> 00:13:08,646
Luke!

151
00:13:10,881 --> 00:13:12,431
I’m sorry I missed it.

152
00:13:14,704 --> 00:13:15,775
Yeah, me too.

153
00:13:52,782 --> 00:13:53,651
I’m sorry.

154
00:13:56,628 --> 00:13:59,694
Peyton’s not here right now. Just her lame music.

155
00:13:59,828 --> 00:14:01,527
Look, I’m really sorry.

156
00:14:02,388 --> 00:14:05,870
It’s just… this guy’s on the team now, and my dad’s been hammering me about it.

157
00:14:07,052 --> 00:14:08,681
But I shouldn’t take it out on you.

158
00:14:09,335 --> 00:14:10,242
I know that.

159
00:14:15,562 --> 00:14:18,214
- Nathan, I’m tired of this.
- I know. I just…

160
00:14:18,647 --> 00:14:21,507
Look, I haven’t been very good to you lately and I just wanted to say…

161
00:14:21,997 --> 00:14:24,102
that I’m sorry, okay?

162
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:29,913
Just say it’s okay so that when I see you tomorrow we can start being us again.

163
00:14:30,066 --> 00:14:30,891
Okay, Peyton?

164
00:14:34,188 --> 00:14:34,961
Okay.

165
00:15:05,502 --> 00:15:08,564
Early in his career, Hemingway was frustrated.

166
00:15:09,184 --> 00:15:11,852
He was a good writer who wanted to be great.

167
00:15:12,384 --> 00:15:15,773
And eventually, he discovered that less was more.

168
00:15:18,252 --> 00:15:18,978
Peyton.

169
00:15:20,161 --> 00:15:22,573
Describe Lucas using just one word.

170
00:15:27,657 --> 00:15:28,682
Choke.

171
00:15:30,401 --> 00:15:32,647
Okay, be quiet please. Thank you.

172
00:15:32,935 --> 00:15:35,475
Lucas, care to respond and describe Peyton?

173
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:40,647
Lonely.

174
00:15:42,337 --> 00:15:44,108
Okay, be quiet please.

175
00:15:48,163 --> 00:15:49,802
Yes? Nathan?

176
00:15:50,708 --> 00:15:52,326
I can describe Lucas in one word.

177
00:15:53,728 --> 00:15:54,885
Bastard.

178
00:15:56,001 --> 00:15:57,445
Alright, alright, alright.

179
00:16:01,306 --> 00:16:03,134
Knock it off. Knock it off!

180
00:16:06,199 --> 00:16:10,081
I’d stand up and every time I do, somebody kicks me in the ass

181
00:16:10,148 --> 00:16:12,171
for putting you on the team. Sit down!

182
00:16:16,036 --> 00:16:18,422
Boy, I must be getting senile.

183
00:16:19,026 --> 00:16:22,217
Because I thought just maybe you were different.

184
00:16:22,641 --> 00:16:25,103
I stuck my neck out for you.

185
00:16:25,427 --> 00:16:26,997
Damnit! I trusted you.

186
00:16:27,889 --> 00:16:31,212
- I shouldn’t have hit him. You’re right.
- Damn right, I’m right.

187
00:16:33,219 --> 00:16:36,225
- I don’t think I can do this.
- Right.

188
00:16:36,962 --> 00:16:41,580
- One bad game and you just run away.
- I didn’t run away.

189
00:16:43,597 --> 00:16:45,297
That’s why I’m in your office.

190
00:16:47,115 --> 00:16:48,697
So what happened after you tackled him?

191
00:16:49,071 --> 00:16:50,142
Kelly broke it up.

192
00:16:50,797 --> 00:16:52,343
Any longer I might’ve destroyed him.

193
00:16:53,151 --> 00:16:54,544
Or he might’ve beaten your ass.

194
00:16:55,891 --> 00:16:57,361
What do you know about it, Jygalski?

195
00:16:58,866 --> 00:17:00,651
What do any of us know about anything?

196
00:17:01,518 --> 00:17:04,452
But if I had do take a guess, I’d say that he tackled you first.

197
00:17:04,907 --> 00:17:07,728
And I’m pretty sure that you were at the bottom of it when Mr. Kelly broke it up.

198
00:17:09,951 --> 00:17:13,299
Well, you’re wrong. Why don’t you grab a rebound every now and then, huh?

199
00:17:14,271 --> 00:17:15,864
What, are you putting on makeup?

200
00:17:16,433 --> 00:17:18,660
Get  out in the gym and start warming up.

201
00:17:19,463 --> 00:17:23,591
Jygalski, when you find the pumps to match your skirt,

202
00:17:23,856 --> 00:17:25,910
you might meet us in the gym.

203
00:17:26,765 --> 00:17:27,809
Lets go.

204
00:17:32,950 --> 00:17:37,527
- Hey. This is just the start of it for you.
- Nathan!

205
00:17:51,693 --> 00:17:52,754
Any side effects?

206
00:17:53,827 --> 00:17:55,718
- From what?
- Your amnesia.

207
00:17:56,348 --> 00:17:57,321
What are you talking about?

208
00:17:57,460 --> 00:18:00,747
I’m talking about how you must’ve gotten amnesia because I know

209
00:18:00,803 --> 00:18:02,872
that you would’ve mentioned that you got into a fight today.

210
00:18:03,584 --> 00:18:05,349
- Are you okay, Luke?
- Yeah.

211
00:18:07,085 --> 00:18:10,505
You ever wake up from a really good dream and try to get back to sleep?

212
00:18:11,127 --> 00:18:15,795
Or you got the flu and you promise yourself that you’d appreciate normal so much more

213
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,960
- if you could just get back to it.
- Yeah.

214
00:18:18,759 --> 00:18:19,808
That’s the way I feel.

215
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:23,172
I just want things to go back to the way they were.

216
00:18:23,921 --> 00:18:24,995
With basketball?

217
00:18:25,952 --> 00:18:27,101
With everything.

218
00:18:31,835 --> 00:18:36,060
You know, it’s really too bad Lucas is poor and he can’t play because he is fine.

219
00:18:39,034 --> 00:18:41,543
Hey, I think it’s really good that you’re fighting with Nathan again.

220
00:18:42,162 --> 00:18:43,545
- You do?
- Yeah.

221
00:18:43,729 --> 00:18:45,882
Every time you guys fight I get to hear new music.

222
00:18:49,775 --> 00:18:51,384
Hey, did you buy the new Beyonce?

223
00:18:51,794 --> 00:18:52,669
No.

224
00:18:54,011 --> 00:18:58,870
You know, Peyton, I know you’re all Gwen Stefani, plaid skirt, I’m a badass,

225
00:18:59,530 --> 00:19:01,613
but we love you anyway, and you know why?

226
00:19:01,823 --> 00:19:04,901
Because Friday night, when it is game time, there you are.

227
00:19:05,475 --> 00:19:06,580
One of us.

228
00:19:07,142 --> 00:19:10,035
P.S. Gwen Stefani is not a badass.

229
00:19:13,472 --> 00:19:14,981
You ever look past it, Brooke?

230
00:19:15,387 --> 00:19:17,198
- Past what?
- All of it.

231
00:19:17,716 --> 00:19:22,126
High school, basketball, and just… the whole popularity drama.

232
00:19:23,165 --> 00:19:23,896
Yeah.

233
00:19:25,216 --> 00:19:28,628
I mean, I think about the future sometimes and it scares me.

234
00:19:31,342 --> 00:19:34,141
But then I think I’ll go to college…

235
00:19:35,687 --> 00:19:39,042
I’ll join the right sorority… I’ll marry a rich guy.

236
00:19:40,952 --> 00:19:42,256
Unless I get fat.

237
00:19:46,692 --> 00:19:50,311
Look, it’s only one game, Luke. Even Jordan played lousy in his first pro game.

238
00:19:51,672 --> 00:19:53,945
Michael Jordan scored 16 points in his first pro game.

239
00:19:54,468 --> 00:19:56,553
Yeah. I know that. I just didn’t think you did.

240
00:19:56,614 --> 00:19:59,373
All I’m saying is, you know, you’ve got to shake it off.

241
00:20:01,027 --> 00:20:02,383
What if I can’t do it, Keith?

242
00:20:03,054 --> 00:20:05,953
- I mean, maybe I can’t play at this level.
- You can.

243
00:20:06,029 --> 00:20:09,377
Well maybe not. And plus, it’s all of them.

244
00:20:09,966 --> 00:20:11,855
I don’t fit into their world. I never will.

245
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,101
It’s stupid.

246
00:20:15,192 --> 00:20:18,788
Even Jordan got cut from his high school varsity team. And he did okay.

247
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:21,159
What’s your mom say about it?

248
00:20:21,604 --> 00:20:22,776
I haven’t talked to her yet.

249
00:20:23,432 --> 00:20:25,404
- Well, you should.
- Why?

250
00:20:25,935 --> 00:20:30,047
Because she deserves it. I mean, she’s going through this thing, too. You’re not the only one.

251
00:20:34,455 --> 00:20:38,305
It’s a rule of life. The prettier the girl, the messier the car.

252
00:20:39,406 --> 00:20:40,405
It’s a real turnoff, huh?

253
00:21:05,432 --> 00:21:06,498
Those are my sketches!

254
00:21:06,958 --> 00:21:09,099
Um… I wasn’t looking.

255
00:21:09,421 --> 00:21:12,974
This is personal. Alright, I don’t read your diary!

256
00:21:13,368 --> 00:21:14,822
- I don’t have a diary.
- No?

257
00:21:15,177 --> 00:21:19,978
Dear Diary, my daddy doesn’t love me. P.S. Stay out of my stuff!

258
00:21:30,182 --> 00:21:31,719
What’s this I hear about a fight?

259
00:21:32,635 --> 00:21:33,280
Nothing.

260
00:21:33,869 --> 00:21:36,259
- Did you win?
- Dad, it was nothing.

261
00:21:36,418 --> 00:21:38,901
No, son, it was something. Because if it was nothing,

262
00:21:38,958 --> 00:21:40,867
the principal wouldn’t have called me at the dealership.

263
00:21:41,217 --> 00:21:44,718
Do you realize how fast a suspension or bad reputation can ruin your prospects?

264
00:21:44,825 --> 00:21:46,331
Dad, he was hitting on my girlfriend!

265
00:21:47,048 --> 00:21:48,958
- What do you want me to do?
- Your girlfriend?

266
00:21:49,598 --> 00:21:53,432
Nathan, if you’re going to get in a fight, get in a fight over something important.

267
00:21:54,855 --> 00:21:55,921
Did you get hurt?

268
00:21:56,827 --> 00:21:57,487
No.

269
00:21:57,932 --> 00:21:59,131
Okay, good.

270
00:22:00,774 --> 00:22:01,610
Did you?

271
00:22:03,253 --> 00:22:05,363
Me? Why?

272
00:22:06,657 --> 00:22:08,189
He wasn’t swinging at me, Dad…

273
00:22:08,951 --> 00:22:10,719
he was swinging at you.

274
00:22:14,338 --> 00:22:18,792
So, you gonna tell me about the fight or you wanna just assume I know about it while I yell at you?

275
00:22:19,668 --> 00:22:20,958
Is that the phone? I’ll get it.

276
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:23,912
Still here.

277
00:22:24,326 --> 00:22:25,647
Mom, he had it coming.

278
00:22:26,482 --> 00:22:27,594
- You know he said...
- No.

279
00:22:28,432 --> 00:22:31,996
When they called me today, I was certain they had the wrong Scott.

280
00:22:32,468 --> 00:22:35,473
And then they told me they had two Scotts and I could take my pick.

281
00:22:35,714 --> 00:22:38,248
Honestly, Lucas, fighting in class? Fighting at all?

282
00:22:38,330 --> 00:22:41,683
- The guy was being a jerk.
- And this is suddenly a surprise to you?

283
00:22:41,782 --> 00:22:44,505
- He hasn’t been a jerk before?
- No. He’s always a jerk.

284
00:22:44,597 --> 00:22:45,933
So why go down to his level?

285
00:22:49,461 --> 00:22:52,139
This wouldn’t have anything to do with playing poorly, would it?

286
00:22:52,543 --> 00:22:55,288
How would you know? You weren’t even there.

287
00:22:59,426 --> 00:23:00,629
I’m sorry. Mom…

288
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:02,569
Mom! I’m so...

289
00:23:45,261 --> 00:23:46,279
How’d you sleep?

290
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,186
Not so good.

291
00:23:50,985 --> 00:23:54,221
I had this really bad dream where I as a jackass to my mom.

292
00:23:56,418 --> 00:23:57,344
- Listen.
- Listen.

293
00:23:57,937 --> 00:23:59,202
- Ooh.
- Jinx.

294
00:24:03,907 --> 00:24:06,468
- Sorry.
- No. I’m sorry.

295
00:24:06,703 --> 00:24:09,094
I should’ve told you the truth about why I couldn’t be there.

296
00:24:09,299 --> 00:24:13,678
I really wanted to Luke, but the idea of walking into that gym…

297
00:24:17,256 --> 00:24:19,985
That’s where he told me he was going away to college without me.

298
00:24:21,643 --> 00:24:23,128
That’s where everything changed.

299
00:24:29,093 --> 00:24:33,655
I don’t regret one second of one day with you, okay?

300
00:24:33,977 --> 00:24:38,411
I  don’t. But that day was a hard day in that gym.

301
00:24:40,603 --> 00:24:42,988
And it was basketball that he chose.

302
00:24:44,694 --> 00:24:48,703
And I’m sorry that you have to hear things like that, but I don’t want to lie to you either.

303
00:24:52,844 --> 00:24:54,273
I’m sorry you had to live it.

304
00:25:00,758 --> 00:25:03,495
Look, I want to talk about what’s happening with the team.

305
00:25:03,606 --> 00:25:06,413
I know you think I’ve been hard on you, but that’s because I see the big picture here.

306
00:25:06,766 --> 00:25:09,392
Whitey’s not going to bench this kid just because of one bad game.

307
00:25:09,853 --> 00:25:12,619
So what? Let him humiliate himself.

308
00:25:12,889 --> 00:25:13,996
No. It’s more than that.

309
00:25:14,841 --> 00:25:18,967
Back when I played for Whitey, his word was law. He was always right.

310
00:25:19,167 --> 00:25:22,448
Even when he was wrong. So eventually I called him on it.

311
00:25:22,705 --> 00:25:24,347
And he benched you in the state championship.

312
00:25:24,441 --> 00:25:27,580
Yeah, so he claimed. He covered and acted like he benched me.

313
00:25:28,004 --> 00:25:31,260
But you should know the truth. I refused to go back in that game.

314
00:25:32,704 --> 00:25:35,145
We were ahead in the fourth quarter, and Whitey wanted to stall.

315
00:25:35,214 --> 00:25:36,672
What did I tell you about playing with the lead?

316
00:25:36,810 --> 00:25:38,680
- Be aggressive.
- Exactly. Be aggressive.

317
00:25:39,156 --> 00:25:42,519
Plus, there were scouts who were there to see me. This guy was checking me.

318
00:25:42,597 --> 00:25:45,064
He was going to some big college back in Tinkham, so I did.

319
00:25:45,776 --> 00:25:47,567
I disobeyed Whitey and I scored on him.

320
00:25:49,038 --> 00:25:50,532
- Nice.
- Yeah.

321
00:25:52,919 --> 00:25:56,697
Yeah, so Whitey called a time out and starts screaming about how it’s his system

322
00:25:56,748 --> 00:25:59,195
that got us there and no one player was bigger than the team.

323
00:25:59,452 --> 00:26:01,167
So I sat down and I called his bluff.

324
00:26:02,370 --> 00:26:03,415
And they lost.

325
00:26:03,983 --> 00:26:06,077
Yeah, I felt bad for the guys.

326
00:26:06,496 --> 00:26:11,872
But he needed to know I’m the one who got us there. Not him and not his system.

327
00:26:13,531 --> 00:26:16,706
Listen, Nathan, I don’t want you to back off this kid.

328
00:26:16,790 --> 00:26:20,485
No matter how poorly he plays, Whitey’s just using him to get back at me.

329
00:26:20,772 --> 00:26:24,520
Eventually I’ll deal with Whitey but for now, it’s just you and me, okay?

330
00:26:25,047 --> 00:26:26,082
- Okay.
- Okay.

331
00:26:29,849 --> 00:26:30,607
Hey Lucas.

332
00:26:31,477 --> 00:26:33,132
Tough game the other night.

333
00:26:34,657 --> 00:26:35,389
Yeah.

334
00:26:35,865 --> 00:26:36,669
It happens.

335
00:26:38,344 --> 00:26:41,600
- So you read a lot, huh?
- Yeah.

336
00:26:42,414 --> 00:26:43,670
Yeah, I got something for you.

337
00:26:45,205 --> 00:26:48,189
Listen, I know we haven’t had really had a chance to talk much since you joined the team but...

338
00:26:48,241 --> 00:26:51,851
I just kinda wanted to stay out of your way, give you a chance to chill, you know.

339
00:26:52,338 --> 00:26:53,746
Oh, I’m Jake.

340
00:26:54,632 --> 00:26:55,921
Yeah, I know.

341
00:26:57,016 --> 00:26:59,029
A lot of talk about your one on one with Nathan.

342
00:27:00,155 --> 00:27:03,130
- Man, I wish I could’ve been there.
- Ah. It was no big deal.

343
00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:04,522
You know Nathan, he’s…

344
00:27:05,168 --> 00:27:07,190
he’s a hell of player he really is. But...

345
00:27:08,251 --> 00:27:10,349
he buys into all of this nonsense.

346
00:27:10,861 --> 00:27:11,906
You’ve got him scared.

347
00:27:14,225 --> 00:27:15,700
Fear changes everything.

348
00:27:20,246 --> 00:27:22,069
- Atlas Shrugged?
- Yeah, you read it?

349
00:27:22,152 --> 00:27:23,405
- No.
- It’s good.

350
00:27:24,188 --> 00:27:25,320
Anyway, you’re gonna be fine.

351
00:27:27,152 --> 00:27:30,097
Just remember… don’t let him take it.

352
00:27:30,835 --> 00:27:32,796
- I don’t know what that means.
- Yeah, I know.

353
00:27:33,522 --> 00:27:34,793
But you will.

354
00:27:41,141 --> 00:27:44,429
Okay, we’re going to try our little Hemingway project again.

355
00:27:45,145 --> 00:27:49,148
But in order to avoid a bar fight, we’re going to do it on paper.

356
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:51,356
Now you don’t have to put your names on these.

357
00:27:51,633 --> 00:27:55,657
Simply write one word, one single word,

358
00:27:55,902 --> 00:28:00,296
to describe what you want most in your life right now.

359
00:28:16,377 --> 00:28:17,826
It’s like this.

360
00:28:23,177 --> 00:28:24,294
You can’t do it, can you?

361
00:28:30,668 --> 00:28:31,517
It’s beautiful.

362
00:28:32,921 --> 00:28:33,996
I always wondered about it?

363
00:28:35,072 --> 00:28:36,168
We all do, right?

364
00:28:41,329 --> 00:28:43,033
What happens when it’s gone?

365
00:28:43,596 --> 00:28:45,665
But see, I’ve never seen anybody lose it.

366
00:28:46,453 --> 00:28:47,697
Like really lose it...

367
00:28:49,019 --> 00:28:50,099
until now.

368
00:28:56,811 --> 00:28:57,631
Go ahead, man.

369
00:28:59,376 --> 00:29:00,271
Prove me wrong.

370
00:29:02,402 --> 00:29:03,809
I don’t have to prove anything to you.

371
00:29:04,281 --> 00:29:05,146
That’s pathetic.

372
00:29:06,421 --> 00:29:09,547
And it’s too bad, really. I mean, I was looking forward to taking you down slowly,

373
00:29:09,637 --> 00:29:12,335
but now? Hell, what’s the point?

374
00:29:13,552 --> 00:29:14,871
You already know it’s over.

375
00:29:16,137 --> 00:29:19,451
I’d say see you at practice, but we both know you’re not going to be there.

376
00:29:20,667 --> 00:29:22,365
Why humiliate yourself, right?

377
00:29:29,513 --> 00:29:30,455
You missed again.

378
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,656
Scott! Lucas Scott!

379
00:29:42,825 --> 00:29:45,896
One more time! Lucas Scott!

380
00:29:54,473 --> 00:29:55,697
No practice today?

381
00:30:05,988 --> 00:30:07,146
What, are you stalking me?

382
00:30:07,662 --> 00:30:10,443
- I thought someone should see them.
- Well, it’s none of your business.

383
00:30:12,691 --> 00:30:15,618
You know what? You’re right. It’s none of my business.

384
00:30:16,822 --> 00:30:19,730
- I wouldn’t know anything about it.
- I know you don’t.

385
00:30:22,136 --> 00:30:25,797
Look, just tell me why you didn’t submit them. Your stuff is good.

386
00:30:26,249 --> 00:30:27,323
It’s not good enough.

387
00:30:28,091 --> 00:30:30,149
Look, Peyton, why not?

388
00:30:34,195 --> 00:30:37,175
I want to draw something that means something to someone.

389
00:30:37,605 --> 00:30:43,800
You know, I want to draw blind faith or a fading summer or… just a moment of clarity.

390
00:30:44,398 --> 00:30:48,351
It’s like when you go and you see a really great band live for the first time, you know,

391
00:30:48,582 --> 00:30:51,310
and nobody’s saying it but everybody’s thinking it --

392
00:30:52,472 --> 00:30:54,152
"We have something to believe in again."

393
00:30:57,070 --> 00:31:00,265
I want to draw that feeling. But, I can’t.

394
00:31:02,139 --> 00:31:04,756
And if I can’t be great at it then I don’t want to ruin it.

395
00:31:05,498 --> 00:31:06,783
It’s too important to me.

396
00:31:11,575 --> 00:31:14,432
Yep. Me too.

397
00:31:23,059 --> 00:31:24,577
Hey, what about your sketchbook?

398
00:31:25,713 --> 00:31:28,963
What about them? They don’t mean anything to anybody, do they?

399
00:31:40,550 --> 00:31:44,094
People who value their lives usually knock first.

400
00:31:46,427 --> 00:31:49,811
Oh. That explains it.

401
00:31:51,758 --> 00:31:55,105
- It’s like a time capsule in here.
- What can I do for you, Danny.

402
00:31:56,145 --> 00:31:56,878
Well…

403
00:31:58,706 --> 00:31:59,934
you can let it go.

404
00:32:02,091 --> 00:32:05,019
That’s definitely the pot calling the kettle black, isn’t it?

405
00:32:05,408 --> 00:32:08,771
If you’ve got a problem with me, Whitey, don’t take it out on Nathan.

406
00:32:08,875 --> 00:32:10,917
What problem would that be, Danny?

407
00:32:11,392 --> 00:32:12,694
Oh. I think you know.

408
00:32:13,610 --> 00:32:14,941
State championship.

409
00:32:17,006 --> 00:32:20,752
Now you’ve gone and humiliated Karen’s son in some feeble attempt to get even.

410
00:32:20,983 --> 00:32:22,053
Karen’s son.

411
00:32:23,277 --> 00:32:25,852
That’s a very convenient way of putting it.

412
00:32:27,270 --> 00:32:31,396
It might interest you to know that Karen’s son has taken himself off the team.

413
00:32:33,216 --> 00:32:34,822
Does that make you happy, Danny?

414
00:32:35,181 --> 00:32:38,974
Seeing the demise of the kid you fathered and then abandoned?

415
00:32:42,770 --> 00:32:46,906
Hey, move Nathan back to shooting guard and you might finally win that state championship.

416
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:50,126
You’re just destroying kids’ lives left and right, aren’t you?

417
00:32:50,885 --> 00:32:52,768
Well, you’ve made a career out of it.

418
00:33:53,404 --> 00:33:54,777
Missed you at practice.

419
00:33:56,365 --> 00:33:57,384
I can’t do it.

420
00:33:58,490 --> 00:33:59,641
You want to know something?

421
00:34:00,849 --> 00:34:04,234
I have had 35 winning seasons.

422
00:34:04,961 --> 00:34:06,759
Do you know what keeps me up at night?

423
00:34:08,179 --> 00:34:10,137
College jobs I never took.

424
00:34:11,171 --> 00:34:13,070
Could’ve beens have a way of doing that.

425
00:34:15,508 --> 00:34:16,271
Yeah.

426
00:34:16,736 --> 00:34:18,340
We got a game tomorrow night.

427
00:34:19,297 --> 00:34:21,575
You’re on my team until tip-off.

428
00:34:22,672 --> 00:34:24,433
The rest is up to you.

429
00:34:32,077 --> 00:34:33,069
Look, son.

430
00:34:35,675 --> 00:34:37,729
There’s no shame in being afraid.

431
00:34:38,717 --> 00:34:40,186
Hell, we’re all afraid.

432
00:34:40,950 --> 00:34:45,553
What you’ve got to do is figure out what you’re afraid of.

433
00:34:46,792 --> 00:34:50,898
Because when you put a face on it, you can beat it.

434
00:34:52,089 --> 00:34:55,352
Or better yet, you can use it.

435
00:34:57,374 --> 00:34:58,434
Think about it.

436
00:35:09,228 --> 00:35:10,861
You’ve got some ugly toes, girl.

437
00:35:11,311 --> 00:35:14,415
- No I don’t.
- Yeah, you do. They’re like practically fingers.

438
00:35:14,675 --> 00:35:16,356
Well, then just focus on the middle one.

439
00:35:17,630 --> 00:35:20,641
Aw, come on. I was just joking. I love your toes.

440
00:35:25,678 --> 00:35:27,614
So I’m thinking about quitting the team.

441
00:35:27,977 --> 00:35:30,231
- Right.
- No, I’m serious.

442
00:35:30,476 --> 00:35:33,676
I don’t even like it anymore. Whitey can’t stand me.

443
00:35:34,259 --> 00:35:35,756
It’s never good enough for my dad.

444
00:35:36,973 --> 00:35:40,890
I think you should. Why not, right? I mean, you can quit the team

445
00:35:40,958 --> 00:35:44,474
and I’ll quit cheerleading and then… we can just walk away from it.

446
00:35:46,250 --> 00:35:47,670
Nathan, lets do it!

447
00:35:48,827 --> 00:35:51,617
Yeah, right. That’s what I’m gonna do.

448
00:35:52,452 --> 00:35:55,200
I gotta go. I’ll see you at the game.

449
00:36:03,679 --> 00:36:05,594
Did you ever figure out your porn name?

450
00:36:06,603 --> 00:36:08,323
- What are you talking about?
- Your porn name.

451
00:36:08,841 --> 00:36:12,532
You know, you take the name of your first pet and your mother’s maiden name

452
00:36:12,584 --> 00:36:15,333
and you put them together. What was the name of your first pet?

453
00:36:15,777 --> 00:36:20,774
- You know that. I had a dog named Rocket.
- Oh, Rocket! Ah! I loved Rocket.

454
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:25,835
So your mother’s maiden name is Roe. Rocket Roe!

455
00:36:26,884 --> 00:36:28,522
- Nice.
- What’s yours?

456
00:36:28,722 --> 00:36:31,656
Oh, I had a bunny, named Bunny.

457
00:36:32,151 --> 00:36:34,095
-  You had a Bunny named Bunny?
- Yes I did.

458
00:36:34,191 --> 00:36:37,563
And my mother’s maiden name is Beaugard. So…

459
00:36:38,347 --> 00:36:39,939
- Bunny Beaugard.
- Bunny Beaugard.

460
00:36:40,237 --> 00:36:43,513
Dawson’s Freak. Starring Rocket Roe and Bunny Beaugard.

461
00:36:45,346 --> 00:36:46,452
- Nice.
- Shut up!

462
00:36:47,333 --> 00:36:51,538
Hey, this game tonight.

463
00:36:52,668 --> 00:36:53,815
You’re not playing anymore...

464
00:36:54,972 --> 00:36:55,700
No.

465
00:37:01,551 --> 00:37:04,035
You know I’ve never walked away from anything before, Haley?

466
00:37:04,527 --> 00:37:06,820
- Yeah.
- But I can’t do it.

467
00:37:07,055 --> 00:37:09,926
And even worse, I don’t know why I can’t do it.

468
00:37:11,459 --> 00:37:16,328
You know, it’s like, no matter how confusing or screwed up life got,

469
00:37:17,081 --> 00:37:20,311
the game always made sense. It was mine, you know.

470
00:37:20,854 --> 00:37:22,749
And in a lot of ways it’s who I am.

471
00:37:23,808 --> 00:37:28,011
But I can’t be that person in their gym,

472
00:37:28,703 --> 00:37:32,994
or in their uniforms, or… in their world.

473
00:37:33,163 --> 00:37:34,238
I hear you, Luke.

474
00:37:35,334 --> 00:37:36,753
But I know you.

475
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:41,497
And I know that no matter what happens you’re still going to be the same guy you always were.

476
00:37:43,623 --> 00:37:51,051
No uniform, no… whatever is gonna ruin that, you know?

477
00:37:53,688 --> 00:37:55,716
Call me later. We’ll go get some pizza.

478
00:38:20,147 --> 00:38:23,927
I took the night off. Thought I’d take in a basketball game.

479
00:38:25,375 --> 00:38:26,636
Sorry, Mom.

480
00:38:28,274 --> 00:38:30,230
No, Luke. I’m sorry.

481
00:38:32,077 --> 00:38:34,090
I’ve always loved the game.

482
00:38:35,341 --> 00:38:36,963
Even in the junior leagues.

483
00:38:37,434 --> 00:38:40,302
I remember when they issued you your first jersey.

484
00:38:40,818 --> 00:38:43,522
And I couldn’t get you out of that. You wore that thing for weeks.

485
00:38:46,215 --> 00:38:48,094
And then you decided to quit playing.

486
00:38:50,337 --> 00:38:51,437
Do you remember why?

487
00:38:56,733 --> 00:38:57,648
Lucas?

488
00:38:59,634 --> 00:39:01,549
I didn’t want to see his face.

489
00:39:02,686 --> 00:39:03,532
Dan.

490
00:39:04,506 --> 00:39:07,546
I didn’t want to be like him. And…

491
00:39:09,962 --> 00:39:13,869
I was afraid that I’d become him if I played.

492
00:39:18,102 --> 00:39:23,345
In the gym, I felt like he had a piece of me.

493
00:39:24,913 --> 00:39:27,042
I never felt like that on the playground.

494
00:39:28,990 --> 00:39:32,712
Well, I’d say he’s taken enough from us.

495
00:39:34,329 --> 00:39:36,915
I took the night off to watch my son play again.

496
00:39:37,933 --> 00:39:40,912
The way that he used to when he loved the game more than anything.

497
00:39:49,787 --> 00:39:50,585
Mom?

498
00:39:54,502 --> 00:39:55,235
Thank you.

499
00:39:57,644 --> 00:40:02,390
It’s hard to fight the things that we’re afraid of. Sometimes we just need a little help.

500
00:40:13,737 --> 00:40:14,957
Hey! Hold on!

501
00:40:18,417 --> 00:40:19,933
Here Could you take a look at these?

502
00:40:21,228 --> 00:40:22,337
You won’t be disappointed.

503
00:40:22,478 --> 00:40:23,459
Sure. Okay.

504
00:40:35,887 --> 00:40:37,254
It’s time to focus now, Nathan.

505
00:40:38,083 --> 00:40:39,947
Put everything out of your mind that bothers you.

506
00:40:41,176 --> 00:40:44,595
I don’t want you thinking about Whitey. I don’t want you thinking about your teammates.

507
00:40:45,150 --> 00:40:46,803
Let them think about you, son.

508
00:40:47,755 --> 00:40:50,255
The other team's thinking about you. And they’re scared.

509
00:40:50,765 --> 00:40:52,030
I’ll see you at the game.

510
00:41:01,738 --> 00:41:03,490
I was beginning to think you weren’t going to show.

511
00:41:03,750 --> 00:41:06,582
It’s game night. Where else would I be?

512
00:41:10,815 --> 00:41:12,200
Uh, son!

513
00:41:20,220 --> 00:41:21,753
Give this to my boy, would you?

514
00:41:34,597 --> 00:41:35,813
Don’t let him take it.

515
00:41:38,168 --> 00:41:39,176
Your talent.

516
00:41:42,059 --> 00:41:43,171
It’s all yours.

517
00:41:54,237 --> 00:41:58,868
Do not let your fire go out, spark by irreplaceable spark

518
00:42:00,543 --> 00:42:04,003
in the hopeless swaps of the not quite, the not yet, and the not at all.

519
00:42:08,704 --> 00:42:10,813
Do not let the hero in your soul perish

520
00:42:12,759 --> 00:42:15,226
in lonely frustration for the life you deserved

521
00:42:18,423 --> 00:42:19,824
and have never been able to reach.

522
00:42:28,039 --> 00:42:29,830
The world you desire can be won.

523
00:42:32,943 --> 00:42:33,762
It exists.

524
00:42:35,754 --> 00:42:36,715
It is real.

525
00:42:38,057 --> 00:42:38,850
Don’t choke.

526
00:42:39,747 --> 00:42:40,822
It is possible.

527
00:42:45,354 --> 00:42:46,940
It is yours.

528
00:42:47,048 --> 00:42:48,530
Your art matters.

529
00:42:49,298 --> 00:42:51,156
It’s what got me here.

530
00:42:55,384 --> 00:42:59,168
Lets go, lets go! Ravens on three! One, two, three! Ravens!

531
00:43:00,350 --> 00:43:01,671
You’re gonna be okay.

532
00:43:02,171 --> 00:43:03,554
Yeah, I am.

533
