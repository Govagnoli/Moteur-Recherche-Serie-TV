1
00:00:00,536 --> 00:00:01,714
Okay, here’s the deal.

2
00:00:01,995 --> 00:00:05,605
Your new council president; Brooke Davis.

3
00:00:07,336 --> 00:00:09,455
I’m totally intimidated by this job.

4
00:00:09,512 --> 00:00:10,838
You’re scared of what’s in here…

5
00:00:11,493 --> 00:00:13,002
I’m scared of what’s out there.

6
00:00:13,063 --> 00:00:15,818
See, the whole time I was gone, I kept thinking about all this stuff.

7
00:00:15,896 --> 00:00:17,318
Well, like what kinda stuff?

8
00:00:17,427 --> 00:00:18,645
Mostly being with you.

9
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:24,211
I love your brother, Dan.

10
00:00:24,276 --> 00:00:25,579
Why won’t you just leave us alone?!

11
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:27,477
Coz I didn’t pay you to fall in love with him.

12
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:30,018
You and I are the only ones who know the truth about Jules.

13
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:31,117
Keith never has to know.

14
00:00:31,184 --> 00:00:32,003
What do you want from me?

15
00:00:32,064 --> 00:00:33,503
I’m sure we can work something out.

16
00:00:34,266 --> 00:00:35,188
It’s Andy, isn’t it?

17
00:00:35,313 --> 00:00:36,350
What can I do for you?

18
00:00:36,673 --> 00:00:37,795
Let Lucas go.

19
00:00:40,395 --> 00:00:41,225
Haley?

20
00:00:41,772 --> 00:00:42,873
I’m sorry, Nathan.

21
00:00:43,364 --> 00:00:44,343
She’s gone.

22
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:47,092
You realise I wouldn’t be in this situation if it wasn’t for you?

23
00:00:47,153 --> 00:00:49,938
If you would have stayed in your place at the Rivercourt, I would have never met Haley.

24
00:00:50,144 --> 00:00:51,644
You ruined my life, man.

25
00:00:52,013 --> 00:00:53,241
You better watch you back.

26
00:01:39,604 --> 00:01:41,662
So you want me to tell you something about myself?

27
00:01:43,305 --> 00:01:44,637
I don’t have anything to say.

28
00:01:45,931 --> 00:01:47,140
Even if I did…

29
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:49,151
you’d be wrong to believe me.

30
00:01:51,768 --> 00:01:52,936
Trust is a lie.

31
00:01:54,666 --> 00:01:56,105
Nobody ever knows anyone.

32
00:01:59,474 --> 00:02:02,290
What does a young fella like you do for recreational activity?

33
00:02:02,674 --> 00:02:06,720
Well… I like athletics… horsing around with my pals.

34
00:02:07,649 --> 00:02:10,901
I suppose most of the fellas like to chase girls.

35
00:02:11,639 --> 00:02:12,945
And does that go for you too?

36
00:02:13,099 --> 00:02:16,299
Ah, no sir, I have a steady girl.

37
00:02:17,445 --> 00:02:19,601
Some kids find it difficult; having a steady.

38
00:02:20,829 --> 00:02:21,762
I don’t.

39
00:02:22,274 --> 00:02:26,400
I guess the key is, just finding someone who feels the same way you do.

40
00:02:30,144 --> 00:02:32,555
In 1955,

41
00:02:33,363 --> 00:02:38,218
students at Tree Hill High School created a time capsule

42
00:02:38,274 --> 00:02:40,423
which was to be opened in fifty years.

43
00:02:40,485 --> 00:02:43,250
They were simply asked to talk about their lives.

44
00:02:44,484 --> 00:02:47,315
Isn’t it interesting how things haven’t changed much?

45
00:02:48,422 --> 00:02:53,138
Within the next week, each of you will go into our converted supply closet…

46
00:02:53,741 --> 00:02:56,076
push the green button in front of you…

47
00:02:56,312 --> 00:02:58,267
and videotape your thoughts.

48
00:02:58,344 --> 00:02:59,065
Do we have to?

49
00:02:59,117 --> 00:03:00,306
Yes, you have to.

50
00:03:01,263 --> 00:03:03,981
I won’t see it. Nobody will.

51
00:03:04,652 --> 00:03:06,842
Not until twenty fifty-five;

52
00:03:07,201 --> 00:03:10,228
by which time, I’ll be dead and buried.

53
00:03:13,694 --> 00:03:14,773
Nate, you got a second?

54
00:03:14,826 --> 00:03:15,431
No.

55
00:03:18,303 --> 00:03:19,664
Are you looking after him?

56
00:03:21,437 --> 00:03:22,506
I’m trying.

57
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:31,025
I need to move out.

58
00:03:31,784 --> 00:03:32,428
What?!

59
00:03:32,766 --> 00:03:34,359
I’m gonna move back in with my folks.

60
00:03:34,441 --> 00:03:36,073
Why, coz we… kissed?

61
00:03:36,131 --> 00:03:37,641
Well… yeah!

62
00:03:38,475 --> 00:03:41,025
- Okay, you know what...
- And I wanna ask you out, Friday night.

63
00:03:43,145 --> 00:03:45,151
I talked to Karen. She agreed to watch Jenny.

64
00:03:45,346 --> 00:03:48,834
Oh. Well, that kinda presumptuous, don’t you think?

65
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:50,000
I don’t know, you tell me.

66
00:03:50,957 --> 00:03:52,540
Oh, and… by the way…

67
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:56,565
you smell insanely good today.

68
00:04:00,004 --> 00:04:01,332
Hey! Um…

69
00:04:02,095 --> 00:04:03,820
Friday night - eight o’clock.

70
00:04:04,937 --> 00:04:05,807
Eight o’clock.

71
00:04:14,158 --> 00:04:20,152
Okay, first-off, I wanna say happy sixty-seventh birthday to Peyton Sawyer.

72
00:04:20,291 --> 00:04:22,165
You were pretty cool back in the day.

73
00:04:22,292 --> 00:04:25,709
And to… Jenny Jagielski, who is…

74
00:04:26,583 --> 00:04:29,738
wow, um, like in her fifties now. Uh…

75
00:04:30,941 --> 00:04:32,635
Your dad… sure loves you.

76
00:04:33,986 --> 00:04:35,877
Plus, he’s a total fox.

77
00:04:37,105 --> 00:04:39,052
I’m not gonna let him out-fox me.

78
00:04:40,669 --> 00:04:41,750
My lawyer called.

79
00:04:42,006 --> 00:04:46,327
The state requires a mediation before they’ll let me remove Lucas from Dan’s care.

80
00:04:48,012 --> 00:04:50,397
But you know what, I’m not gonna let him rattle me.

81
00:04:51,206 --> 00:04:55,077
I will present my case… calmly… and rationally…

82
00:04:55,773 --> 00:04:57,387
and let justice prevail.

83
00:04:58,707 --> 00:05:00,330
Well you’re wise to use the system.

84
00:05:01,109 --> 00:05:04,007
But just in case, I mad some calls.

85
00:05:05,609 --> 00:05:06,470
And…?

86
00:05:06,551 --> 00:05:08,430
Well, if Dan’s the man I think he is…

87
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,658
my guy should have something soon.

88
00:05:15,244 --> 00:05:16,500
What’s up, Ms. President?

89
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,228
Please don’t remind me. It was really fun to win and all

90
00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:21,317
but now I actually have to do something.

91
00:05:21,719 --> 00:05:22,935
What was I thinking?

92
00:05:23,038 --> 00:05:24,701
Ah, you were thinking that you’d be great at this and…

93
00:05:24,759 --> 00:05:28,546
everyone who voted for you, including me, was thinking the same thing.

94
00:05:30,471 --> 00:05:31,568
But…

95
00:05:32,285 --> 00:05:33,422
I got you something.

96
00:05:33,714 --> 00:05:36,037
A present… for the president.

97
00:05:36,103 --> 00:05:39,269
A present! Maybe this was a good idea. What did I get?

98
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:42,314
It’s the book where I found the quote for you.

99
00:05:43,003 --> 00:05:47,502
There’s a lotta… great stuff on leadership in there.

100
00:05:47,936 --> 00:05:50,159
Oh… Lucas, thank you, it’s perfect.

101
00:05:50,266 --> 00:05:51,956
I also thought you’d like these too.

102
00:05:53,445 --> 00:05:56,810
I am so warming up to being the president!

103
00:05:56,943 --> 00:05:58,305
There’s my girl!

104
00:05:58,597 --> 00:06:00,183
Boyfriend, hi.

105
00:06:00,844 --> 00:06:02,831
- How was your cruise?
- Oh, it sucked!

106
00:06:03,066 --> 00:06:04,525
Wasted time away from you.

107
00:06:04,915 --> 00:06:06,589
Yeah, even the topless beach?

108
00:06:07,356 --> 00:06:09,784
Imagine the buzz kill when I found my sister there.

109
00:06:12,751 --> 00:06:13,804
What’s this?

110
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:16,388
Oh, Lucas got me a gift; for being the president.

111
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,371
A gift, huh?

112
00:06:20,372 --> 00:06:22,302
Well I was gonna wait and surprise you but what the hell,

113
00:06:22,369 --> 00:06:24,811
I’m throwing my baby a party to celebrate; Friday night.

114
00:06:24,971 --> 00:06:27,515
A… party with… presents?

115
00:06:27,576 --> 00:06:28,329
You know it.

116
00:06:28,421 --> 00:06:30,944
Oh, I so love being the freaking president!

117
00:06:33,183 --> 00:06:34,637
Well, look, congrats again, Brooke.

118
00:06:35,704 --> 00:06:37,540
- See ya later.
- Thanks, Luke.

119
00:06:40,366 --> 00:06:43,740
Uh, okay, I’ll… let you guys… make out and…

120
00:06:45,784 --> 00:06:47,585
My name is Anna Tagaro

121
00:06:47,801 --> 00:06:50,211
and I’m a junior at Tree Hill High…

122
00:06:50,657 --> 00:06:55,716
and… since it’s twenty fifty-five, I guess it’s okay to say that…

123
00:06:56,965 --> 00:06:59,137
I’m bisexual.

124
00:07:01,876 --> 00:07:05,977
Although, if I still haven’t found the nerve to come out to my friends and family…

125
00:07:06,053 --> 00:07:07,722
by twenty fifty-five…

126
00:07:09,831 --> 00:07:10,984
surprise!

127
00:07:11,122 --> 00:07:12,182
Surprise!

128
00:07:14,629 --> 00:07:17,839
Keith… what is this?

129
00:07:17,918 --> 00:07:20,399
This, my beautiful bride-to-be,

130
00:07:20,814 --> 00:07:22,017
is your new home.

131
00:07:22,955 --> 00:07:24,142
You bought a house?!

132
00:07:25,652 --> 00:07:29,446
Keith, you can’t just buy me a house, this is too much!

133
00:07:29,508 --> 00:07:30,916
It’s not too much.

134
00:07:32,238 --> 00:07:34,382
The truth is - it’s not nearly enough.

135
00:07:36,748 --> 00:07:38,059
I love you, Jules.


136
00:07:44,448 --> 00:07:45,359
Nate?

137
00:07:47,475 --> 00:07:48,283
How ya been?

138
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,520
Drunk, bitter…

139
00:07:51,103 --> 00:07:52,093
kinda like mom.

140
00:07:55,012 --> 00:07:55,708
Listen,

141
00:07:57,075 --> 00:07:59,287
I wanna apologise to you, son, man to man.

142
00:08:00,759 --> 00:08:02,824
It was a hell of a punch you hit me with.

143
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:06,388
Guess I probably had it coming.

144
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:08,344
Okay.

145
00:08:08,421 --> 00:08:11,969
Hey, don’t shut me out, or your brother.

146
00:08:12,225 --> 00:08:14,288
Especially since we’re all working together now.

147
00:08:21,395 --> 00:08:22,505
Nice try, dad.

148
00:08:22,829 --> 00:08:23,934
It’s not that easy.

149
00:08:25,168 --> 00:08:26,003
I quit.

150
00:08:37,702 --> 00:08:39,806
My best friend, Haley, left town recently.

151
00:08:41,107 --> 00:08:42,704
And it’s… been hard.

152
00:08:44,139 --> 00:08:49,684
You know… until this year, it’s-it’s always been us against the world.

153
00:08:50,487 --> 00:08:52,448
We pretty much grew up together and…

154
00:08:53,477 --> 00:08:55,233
now she’s just gone.

155
00:08:58,204 --> 00:09:00,886
You know, I… I understand the leaving part.

156
00:09:02,039 --> 00:09:03,061
Trust me…

157
00:09:05,729 --> 00:09:09,094
I just wish she woulda called me; before she left.

158
00:09:10,082 --> 00:09:13,046
I wish… I coulda talked to her about it.

159
00:09:14,413 --> 00:09:15,949
I mean, not to change her mind…

160
00:09:16,676 --> 00:09:19,738
or to tell her what to do, but…

161
00:09:20,087 --> 00:09:21,161
just to say

162
00:09:22,836 --> 00:09:23,777
I love you…

163
00:09:25,012 --> 00:09:26,118
and I miss you.

164
00:09:29,568 --> 00:09:30,858
Just to say goodbye.

165
00:09:35,851 --> 00:09:36,789
Nathan?

166
00:09:39,665 --> 00:09:41,728
- What’re you doing?
- Haley hates pink!

167
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:44,570
Yeah, so?

168
00:09:48,457 --> 00:09:49,634
Look, Nate.

169
00:09:49,692 --> 00:09:51,109
Haley’s my best friend.

170
00:09:51,564 --> 00:09:53,427
You know, I know it’s not the same but…

171
00:09:54,774 --> 00:09:56,269
I get what you’re going through.

172
00:09:59,777 --> 00:10:01,286
- A clown.
- Yeah.

173
00:10:02,398 --> 00:10:03,484
They creep her out.

174
00:10:05,358 --> 00:10:07,394
- Man, you gotta call her.
- I did that.

175
00:10:08,932 --> 00:10:10,104
I got her voicemail.

176
00:10:10,318 --> 00:10:13,943
Voicemail; I hope you don’t still got that crap.

177
00:10:14,129 --> 00:10:17,672
So you’re having sex with Jake Jagielski tonight.

178
00:10:17,758 --> 00:10:20,149
Brooke, it’s our first date!

179
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:24,031
Please! You are sharing a bed, you have history,

180
00:10:24,101 --> 00:10:28,700
he’s clearly experienced; see ‘Skanky Ho’, otherwise known as Nikki…

181
00:10:30,471 --> 00:10:33,405
Seriously though; sex. You. Tonight.

182
00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:34,711
I have to go.

183
00:10:35,275 --> 00:10:36,104
Wait.

184
00:10:38,264 --> 00:10:39,074
Which one?

185
00:10:39,304 --> 00:10:43,672
Black bra, black sweater, leather jacket, Calvin’s, condoms, underwear; optional.

186
00:10:44,461 --> 00:10:45,116
Have fun!

187
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:46,600
Brooke.

188
00:10:49,002 --> 00:10:51,849
You don’t think I’m crazy for wanting to take it slow, do you?

189
00:10:52,976 --> 00:10:53,683
No.

190
00:10:54,367 --> 00:10:55,796
I don’t think you’re crazy.

191
00:10:56,349 --> 00:10:57,835
Now he might.

192
00:10:58,966 --> 00:11:00,978
You’ll be fine; you’ve got good hips.

193
00:11:02,037 --> 00:11:03,409
I’ll see you at the party!

194
00:11:05,729 --> 00:11:06,959
Fifty years, huh?

195
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:11,653
Okay. Well, if you’re young and you’re watching this…

196
00:11:12,016 --> 00:11:16,057
you guys know what you’re up against, especially if you’re a girl,

197
00:11:16,149 --> 00:11:19,319
it’s… sex, right, and…

198
00:11:19,596 --> 00:11:23,384
and even fifty years from now, I’m guessing it’s still a really big deal.

199
00:11:23,511 --> 00:11:27,449
You know, it’s awkward… and… threatening…

200
00:11:28,155 --> 00:11:29,174
and thrilling.

201
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:33,562
But, in a way, it’s like sex is the easy part.

202
00:11:34,099 --> 00:11:37,658
You know, it’s… giving your heart to somebody;

203
00:11:38,288 --> 00:11:39,982
that’s the scary part.

204
00:11:40,813 --> 00:11:41,877
Trust me.

205
00:11:42,794 --> 00:11:45,077
I understand this mediation’s a formality.

206
00:11:45,399 --> 00:11:49,281
But in my defence, I’m providing a safe and stable environment for Lucas;

207
00:11:49,684 --> 00:11:51,399
two parent, loving.

208
00:11:52,516 --> 00:11:56,437
That said, I understand, sometimes, things aren’t always as they appear.

209
00:11:56,898 --> 00:11:58,117
Your name is Roger?

210
00:11:58,322 --> 00:11:59,009
Doug.

211
00:11:59,567 --> 00:12:00,258
Doug.

212
00:12:02,127 --> 00:12:05,623
Doug… I’m not sure there’s a courtroom in the country that’d have a problem

213
00:12:05,681 --> 00:12:07,949
with the home I’ve made for my firstborn son.

214
00:12:08,235 --> 00:12:11,533
Yeah, of course, Dan. Uh, but, I do have a couple of questions.

215
00:12:12,428 --> 00:12:15,695
Can you tell my why you’ve never paid any child support to Karen

216
00:12:15,761 --> 00:12:17,860
or offered any financial help for Lucas.

217
00:12:18,157 --> 00:12:19,295
I did offer.

218
00:12:19,647 --> 00:12:22,350
But, uh, Lucas’ mother forbid my involvement;

219
00:12:22,617 --> 00:12:24,235
financially and otherwise.

220
00:12:24,311 --> 00:12:25,192
I see…

221
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:26,115
Ass!

222
00:12:27,287 --> 00:12:28,045
I’m sorry?

223
00:12:28,479 --> 00:12:29,626
He’s an ass.

224
00:12:30,548 --> 00:12:31,393
Okay.

225
00:12:31,484 --> 00:12:35,099
I didn’t take his money because to him, money is power

226
00:12:35,166 --> 00:12:36,896
and power is control.

227
00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:40,793
And he would have used it in the same manipulative manner that he always does!

228
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:42,452
Lucas is my son!

229
00:12:42,545 --> 00:12:47,077
And he has been every day of his life and there’s not a court in this country, Dan,

230
00:12:47,162 --> 00:12:50,342
that's gonna fall for your... ass of a suit

231
00:12:50,419 --> 00:12:54,926
and your... crooked-ass smile and your... assy frat boy haircut!!

232
00:13:04,879 --> 00:13:06,106
Lucas?

233
00:13:07,674 --> 00:13:08,959
Where do you wanna live?

234
00:13:15,959 --> 00:13:17,259
Whoa, we got a baby here.

235
00:13:17,683 --> 00:13:19,992
I’m sorry. I lost track of the time.

236
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:20,966
That’s alright.

237
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:22,758
Me and Jenny have been bonding, hey?

238
00:13:26,105 --> 00:13:27,744
You go to sleep.

239
00:13:30,605 --> 00:13:31,424
How’d it go?

240
00:13:34,037 --> 00:13:35,681
He chose his father!

241
00:13:40,866 --> 00:13:41,537
Hey.

242
00:13:47,934 --> 00:13:49,233
We’re gonna fix this.

243
00:13:51,742 --> 00:13:52,775
I promise you.

244
00:13:56,529 --> 00:13:57,415
I promise.

245
00:14:01,163 --> 00:14:02,086
Oh, God!

246
00:14:06,118 --> 00:14:07,659
Hey, that’s my girl!

247
00:14:08,186 --> 00:14:08,985
Hi!

248
00:14:09,539 --> 00:14:12,124
So… I love a party…

249
00:14:12,559 --> 00:14:15,780
but… do I know any of these people?

250
00:14:16,210 --> 00:14:18,839
Sure. Look, there’s Mouth.

251
00:14:23,425 --> 00:14:24,105
Hi.

252
00:14:24,762 --> 00:14:25,442
Hey.

253
00:14:26,317 --> 00:14:29,630
So… everybody looks… really drunk.

254
00:14:29,789 --> 00:14:31,698
Nah, most of them are just stoned.

255
00:14:32,031 --> 00:14:32,727
Come on.

256
00:14:32,890 --> 00:14:33,638
Um…

257
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:35,457
you go.

258
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:38,769
I’m gonna… find a drink.

259
00:14:39,368 --> 00:14:41,769
Uh, okay. In the tub.

260
00:14:44,006 --> 00:14:45,205
Oh, sorry.

261
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:54,427
Erica Marsh?

262
00:14:55,778 --> 00:14:56,771
Erica?!

263
00:14:56,915 --> 00:14:59,141
Oh, Brooke, congratulations!

264
00:15:00,781 --> 00:15:02,460
Do you… drink?

265
00:15:02,904 --> 00:15:08,097
I do now. Besides, you said I should find other activities.

266
00:15:08,385 --> 00:15:11,236
Yeah, I meant, like…

267
00:15:11,385 --> 00:15:14,672
pep-club… not… beer-bong club.

268
00:15:14,988 --> 00:15:17,482
Come one, Marsh, we’re doing shots!

269
00:15:18,441 --> 00:15:19,430
Who is that guy?

270
00:15:20,139 --> 00:15:21,026
I dunno,

271
00:15:21,399 --> 00:15:23,499
but he called me by my last name.

272
00:15:23,591 --> 00:15:25,361
I mean, how great is that?!

273
00:15:30,610 --> 00:15:32,239
Nate, thank you for coming.

274
00:15:32,437 --> 00:15:34,659
Whatever, I just ran out of alcohol.

275
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,477
What’d you seal in the time capsule, Luke?

276
00:15:41,723 --> 00:15:43,089
Nothing, really.

277
00:15:44,230 --> 00:15:45,679
I didn’t have much to say.

278
00:15:46,248 --> 00:15:47,188
I did.

279
00:15:48,429 --> 00:15:50,799
What?! It’s important.

280
00:15:51,018 --> 00:15:54,301
Some day the kids are gonna need to know the truth about how I really was.

281
00:15:54,398 --> 00:15:56,323
Pretty much been with all the hot girls;

282
00:15:56,678 --> 00:15:59,058
freshmen, seniors.

283
00:15:59,667 --> 00:16:01,596
Yeah, it’s good times.

284
00:16:02,108 --> 00:16:03,891
Currently I’m dating, um,…

285
00:16:05,074 --> 00:16:06,194
Brooke Davis.

286
00:16:06,619 --> 00:16:07,675
What’s with you?

287
00:16:08,633 --> 00:16:09,488
Nothing.

288
00:16:10,967 --> 00:16:14,263
We were just talking about the time capsule; about what we said.

289
00:16:14,926 --> 00:16:16,747
Does it really matter?

290
00:16:16,941 --> 00:16:19,685
By the time they open that thing, we’re gonna be old.

291
00:16:20,121 --> 00:16:21,176
Maybe not.

292
00:16:21,545 --> 00:16:23,567
Sometimes they open time capsules early;

293
00:16:23,757 --> 00:16:25,923
when a building moves or there’s a fire.

294
00:16:26,209 --> 00:16:27,336
You never know.

295
00:16:31,202 --> 00:16:32,066
Hey!

296
00:16:33,214 --> 00:16:34,522
Nice wheels outside.

297
00:16:35,666 --> 00:16:36,654
Gift from daddy?

298
00:16:41,815 --> 00:16:42,772
How’s Nathan?

299
00:16:43,490 --> 00:16:45,317
Uh… not good.

300
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:48,481
Well, I know it’s none of my business but...

301
00:16:48,635 --> 00:16:51,010
that’s your jacket in Felix’s room, right?

302
00:16:51,153 --> 00:16:51,829
Yeah.

303
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:55,674
Well… Nathan was going through the pockets a few minutes ago.

304
00:16:57,554 --> 00:16:58,404
Thanks.

305
00:16:59,802 --> 00:17:00,749
What’s going on?

306
00:17:01,644 --> 00:17:02,735
Brother stuff.

307
00:17:02,997 --> 00:17:06,678
Hey, Mouth, you’re like, in the AV club or whatever, right?

308
00:17:06,873 --> 00:17:08,653
Media club, yeah.

309
00:17:10,012 --> 00:17:14,516
Well… I said something in the time capsule that I need to erase.

310
00:17:14,936 --> 00:17:16,550
You think you could help me do it?

311
00:17:17,051 --> 00:17:18,525
Like… tonight?

312
00:17:18,602 --> 00:17:20,329
You mean break into the school?

313
00:17:22,445 --> 00:17:24,040
Anna, I can’t.

314
00:17:24,123 --> 00:17:27,178
Mouth, haven’t you ever done something that you wished you could take back?

315
00:17:32,627 --> 00:17:33,456
Sure.

316
00:17:34,269 --> 00:17:36,031
Not too long ago, actually.

317
00:17:36,297 --> 00:17:38,294
What if you had the chance to erase it?

318
00:17:41,674 --> 00:17:42,775
Hey, Nathan!

319
00:17:43,803 --> 00:17:45,103
Nathan, stop!

320
00:17:45,698 --> 00:17:47,465
Move or I’ll run you over!

321
00:17:48,356 --> 00:17:49,727
Give me the keys!

322
00:17:55,177 --> 00:17:56,312
Nathan, you’ve been drinking.

323
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:57,592
You just better hold on.

324
00:18:06,964 --> 00:18:08,139
Pull the car over, Nate.

325
00:18:09,803 --> 00:18:11,769
Hey, don’t be a dick and drink drunk!

326
00:18:11,910 --> 00:18:13,071
I’m not even buzzed!

327
00:18:13,157 --> 00:18:14,545
It’s still an open container.

328
00:18:15,246 --> 00:18:16,029
Fine!

329
00:18:33,603 --> 00:18:35,420
Huh, god I love my life!

330
00:18:36,074 --> 00:18:36,822
Think we can outrun them?

331
00:18:36,909 --> 00:18:38,583
Look, just pull over. Don’t make it worse!

332
00:18:39,570 --> 00:18:42,807
Alright, Luke. Seeing as how I’ve already been arrested once this year,

333
00:18:43,554 --> 00:18:44,891
it’s been nice knowing ya.

334
00:19:06,109 --> 00:19:07,461
Evening officer.

335
00:19:08,433 --> 00:19:09,534
Buy us some beer?

336
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:19,389
Okay, so… I’m a single father…

337
00:19:19,503 --> 00:19:22,835
and… until recently, a high school dropout…

338
00:19:23,112 --> 00:19:26,466
and… I’m going on my first date since my daughter was born…

339
00:19:28,733 --> 00:19:30,260
Am I a great catch or what?!

340
00:19:33,305 --> 00:19:34,309
You warm enough?

341
00:19:35,438 --> 00:19:38,590
That’s good. Coz I had to call in a few favours to get the breeze just right.

342
00:19:40,315 --> 00:19:41,417
How bout the stars?

343
00:19:41,539 --> 00:19:44,422
I told them not to go too heavy so they didn’t look all ‘Movie Moment’.

344
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:46,602
You know, more than a million less than a billion.

345
00:19:46,981 --> 00:19:51,569
Right, you know, you wouldn’t think just a stroll down the river would take so much planning!

346
00:19:51,642 --> 00:19:52,630
What are you kidding?!

347
00:19:53,279 --> 00:19:58,712
Romantic lighting, couple scattered about, music in the distance.

348
00:19:58,783 --> 00:20:00,499
Hmmm, you’re just lucky I’m a cheap date.

349
00:20:00,693 --> 00:20:01,661
Yeah, I know.

350
00:20:03,350 --> 00:20:04,512
And I am lucky…

351
00:20:05,108 --> 00:20:06,228
to be with you tonight.

352
00:20:10,408 --> 00:20:12,765
You know, some guys charge extra for hand holding.

353
00:20:13,257 --> 00:20:16,899
You know, some girls charge extra for this.

354
00:20:29,017 --> 00:20:29,965
Perfect!

355
00:20:32,146 --> 00:20:33,564
Nice work, jack-hole!

356
00:20:34,306 --> 00:20:36,805
Hey, you’re the one who was driving.

357
00:20:38,239 --> 00:20:41,480
Yeah! You either thank me, or shut up!

358
00:20:41,536 --> 00:20:44,332
Whatever. I didn’t ask to you take the fall.

359
00:20:50,901 --> 00:20:53,224
Hey, call for a pizza. I’m starving.

360
00:20:53,327 --> 00:20:54,638
Oh, you’re hilarious.

361
00:20:55,156 --> 00:20:56,819
Someone’s gotta bail us out.

362
00:20:57,270 --> 00:21:00,593
No problem; call my wife. Oh, wait a minute...

363
00:21:01,324 --> 00:21:02,318
scratch that.

364
00:21:10,629 --> 00:21:13,552
Mouth, I really- I don’t think this mask is necessary.

365
00:21:13,792 --> 00:21:15,584
I just don’t want to get into trouble.

366
00:21:15,656 --> 00:21:17,852
I’ve never done anything like this before, you know?

367
00:21:24,073 --> 00:21:26,321
What do you think? Can you erase it?

368
00:21:26,654 --> 00:21:27,612
I don’t know.

369
00:21:28,114 --> 00:21:30,908
I gotta figure out if I can take this thing apart first.

370
00:21:32,409 --> 00:21:35,235
Here, there’s a coffee machine in the teachers lounge,

371
00:21:35,603 --> 00:21:37,201
this might take a while.

372
00:21:38,778 --> 00:21:40,739
So it’ll take a little longer than you thought.

373
00:21:40,918 --> 00:21:42,264
But Lucas will come around.

374
00:21:43,554 --> 00:21:45,403
He was like a stranger today.

375
00:21:46,031 --> 00:21:48,188
He actually chose Dan over me!

376
00:21:48,285 --> 00:21:49,402
Karen, come on.

377
00:21:50,293 --> 00:21:52,633
There’s more to this than meets the eye. You know that.

378
00:21:52,747 --> 00:21:54,106
Well then he’s lying to me…

379
00:21:54,301 --> 00:21:57,148
and he should trust me Andy. I mean, what’s next, life of crime?

380
00:22:05,715 --> 00:22:07,215
- Hello!
- Hey, mom.

381
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:10,503
Mom, uh, look, don’t freak out, okay,

382
00:22:10,553 --> 00:22:12,841
but I’m in jail… and I need you to bail me out.

383
00:22:12,907 --> 00:22:14,487
What-what happened? Is it Dan?!

384
00:22:14,547 --> 00:22:16,656
No. No, mom, its not. It’s…

385
00:22:18,519 --> 00:22:21,413
I was with Nathan and we had some beer in the car.

386
00:22:21,570 --> 00:22:23,579
Lucas, listen, are you okay?

387
00:22:23,778 --> 00:22:24,838
Yeah, we’re fine.

388
00:22:25,027 --> 00:22:27,602
Okay, you got a quarter in your pocket?

389
00:22:28,171 --> 00:22:29,015
Yeah.

390
00:22:29,139 --> 00:22:31,683
Good, call the father you love so much.

391
00:22:37,811 --> 00:22:38,647
What happened?

392
00:22:38,810 --> 00:22:39,880
She’s not coming.

393
00:22:41,902 --> 00:22:42,727
Wow…

394
00:22:43,822 --> 00:22:45,744
even you own mom can’t stand you.

395
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,547
See, what else, um…

396
00:22:52,706 --> 00:22:55,650
oh yeah, there’s this new girl, Anna, who’s into me but…

397
00:22:55,732 --> 00:23:00,300
I’m all ‘girl… be patient, you know, ‘The Tim’ will get to you eventually’.

398
00:23:00,794 --> 00:23:02,261
What did he just say?!

399
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,559
Okay, I think I got it.

400
00:23:04,973 --> 00:23:07,897
Did that creepy Tim guy say I was into him?

401
00:23:08,076 --> 00:23:10,104
Um… sorta.

402
00:23:10,635 --> 00:23:13,494
Okay, first of all; gross,

403
00:23:13,759 --> 00:23:17,298
second; we shouldn’t be watching these. We’re just here to erase mine.

404
00:23:17,364 --> 00:23:19,720
I know, you’re right. Um… let me find it.

405
00:23:24,189 --> 00:23:29,136
Let’s see, in ten years, I’ll probably be married to someone like Marvin McFadden.

406
00:23:29,335 --> 00:23:30,636
Who’s Marvin McFadden?

407
00:23:30,722 --> 00:23:34,317
Of course, you all probably call him Senator McFadden or something…

408
00:23:34,758 --> 00:23:36,594
but, we just call him Mouth.

409
00:23:38,628 --> 00:23:41,515
It would be really wrong to watch this, right?

410
00:23:42,504 --> 00:23:44,424
Maybe just a… couple of minutes.

411
00:23:44,551 --> 00:23:46,051
Two minutes, tops!

412
00:23:52,335 --> 00:23:54,106
Well I know tonight’s date was kind of…

413
00:23:54,177 --> 00:23:55,155
Perfect?

414
00:23:57,281 --> 00:24:01,080
Yeah. Well… I guess this is goodnight.

415
00:24:01,162 --> 00:24:04,321
Well, it wouldn’t have to be if you were still staying here.

416
00:24:04,412 --> 00:24:08,606
Okay, that’s not fair. The only reason I moved out is because if I stayed here, we'd...

417
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:15,114
Never. Stop. Doing. That.

418
00:24:15,232 --> 00:24:17,669
That’s a… that’s a problem why?

419
00:24:19,112 --> 00:24:20,007
Right.

420
00:24:20,509 --> 00:24:22,061
I guess I can move back in, huh?

421
00:24:23,003 --> 00:24:23,982
Come here.

422
00:24:29,116 --> 00:24:31,143
Whoa, no! Whoa, is she okay?

423
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:33,038
She’s good. She’s good.

424
00:24:33,090 --> 00:24:33,940
It’s cool. I got her.

425
00:24:34,002 --> 00:24:37,185
I don’t think so, buddy. It’s Rosey Pom for you tonight, kay?

426
00:24:37,304 --> 00:24:38,010
Go away.

427
00:24:38,591 --> 00:24:39,306
Go away.

428
00:24:39,736 --> 00:24:41,604
Come here. Whoa, Erica?

429
00:24:42,433 --> 00:24:43,366
Erica?

430
00:24:44,036 --> 00:24:46,179
It’s Marsh. Call me Marsh.

431
00:24:46,244 --> 00:24:50,103
Oh, okay Marsh. Let’s get you home, okay?

432
00:24:50,181 --> 00:24:52,986
Come here, come on, I got you. Whoa, there we go.

433
00:24:57,675 --> 00:24:59,145
What is so funny?

434
00:25:00,923 --> 00:25:01,660
You.

435
00:25:03,621 --> 00:25:05,628
What, do you need me to, uh, connect the dots for you?

436
00:25:05,710 --> 00:25:07,153
I just need you to shut up!

437
00:25:07,808 --> 00:25:09,139
When I first met you,

438
00:25:09,652 --> 00:25:12,335
I figured the best way to hurt you was to take Haley away.

439
00:25:13,517 --> 00:25:14,992
Now she’s gone, isn’t she?

440
00:25:15,074 --> 00:25:17,608
And is it any wonder she left a stroke like you?

441
00:25:18,674 --> 00:25:20,184
Look at yourself, you’re pathetic!

442
00:25:20,297 --> 00:25:21,607
Oh, I’m pathetic?

443
00:25:22,232 --> 00:25:25,478
You’re chasing after a father who doesn’t even want you and I’m pathetic?!

444
00:25:25,908 --> 00:25:27,752
Would you just let it go!?

445
00:25:28,509 --> 00:25:31,063
Why are you so threatened by that?!

446
00:25:32,539 --> 00:25:34,601
Afraid daddy will like me more than you?

447
00:25:34,908 --> 00:25:37,177
You mean kinda how he liked my mom better than yours?

448
00:25:38,893 --> 00:25:45,037
No… I mean kinda like how your wife likes Chris better than you!

449
00:25:47,001 --> 00:25:49,020
Hey! Hey, you two, stop!

450
00:25:56,347 --> 00:25:59,614
So you’re probably looking at this and making fun of my outfit, right?

451
00:26:00,771 --> 00:26:04,902
Anyway, here’s all you really need to know about today;

452
00:26:04,989 --> 00:26:09,988
if… you fat, dumb, sexual, and a guy, you’re okay.

453
00:26:10,324 --> 00:26:13,038
If you’re a girl, not so much.

454
00:26:13,887 --> 00:26:16,176
Please tell me that’s changed in the future.

455
00:26:16,302 --> 00:26:17,631
Don’t bet on it.

456
00:26:18,905 --> 00:26:21,332
Somebody tell me you’ve got love figured out,

457
00:26:21,455 --> 00:26:24,313
because I got news for you; it’s pretty darn messy right now.

458
00:26:25,365 --> 00:26:27,671
But I guess it’s always been that way.

459
00:26:28,384 --> 00:26:29,858
Wanting to be loved,

460
00:26:30,785 --> 00:26:33,754
to find somebody that makes your heart ache in a good way…

461
00:26:34,579 --> 00:26:35,719
feel understood.

462
00:26:37,292 --> 00:26:40,312
So… if you’re robots, or aliens,

463
00:26:40,394 --> 00:26:44,077
or something and you’re watching this right now and that feeling no longer exists;

464
00:26:45,597 --> 00:26:48,146
well… you missed it…

465
00:26:49,130 --> 00:26:50,849
and I feel sorry for you.

466
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:54,997
Coz as far as I can tell, that’s what it’s all about.

467
00:26:55,841 --> 00:26:57,885
And that’s what I know it should be about.

468
00:27:12,129 --> 00:27:14,443
Dan wanted revenge on Keith.

469
00:27:16,671 --> 00:27:18,130
That’s why I’m staying with him.

470
00:27:21,821 --> 00:27:22,959
Revenge for what?

471
00:27:23,239 --> 00:27:25,021
Keith slept with your mom.

472
00:27:28,487 --> 00:27:30,474
- It’s true.
- Course it is!

473
00:27:30,561 --> 00:27:32,865
Nobody’s faithful anymore, nobody can be trusted.

474
00:27:34,544 --> 00:27:38,926
Yeah, well, Dan also hired Jules to make Keith fall in love with her.

475
00:27:40,889 --> 00:27:42,095
It’s outstanding!

476
00:27:43,094 --> 00:27:44,047
What else you got?

477
00:27:44,179 --> 00:27:45,036
That’s it.

478
00:27:45,501 --> 00:27:46,722
Stay with Dan…

479
00:27:49,934 --> 00:27:51,732
Keith and Jules get to be happy.

480
00:27:52,347 --> 00:27:56,222
Yeah, till she sings a duet… and goes on tour.

481
00:27:58,742 --> 00:28:00,186
She’s got a dream, Nate.

482
00:28:00,261 --> 00:28:03,764
No… no, she left to be with Chris.

483
00:28:06,851 --> 00:28:08,747
She kissed him, before she left.

484
00:28:10,191 --> 00:28:11,127
I’m sorry.

485
00:28:11,337 --> 00:28:13,451
Well, that’s what she said when I called her.

486
00:28:14,147 --> 00:28:15,904
- I thought you said-
- I lied!

487
00:28:17,747 --> 00:28:19,165
She said she was sorry.

488
00:28:19,892 --> 00:28:22,114
Said she loved me and it wasn’t about Chris.

489
00:28:22,186 --> 00:28:25,130
She just… needs some time to figure everything out.

490
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:32,477
You believe that? Because, if I love her… and if she loves me,

491
00:28:33,650 --> 00:28:35,043
what’s there to figure out?

492
00:28:45,539 --> 00:28:46,757
Do you have ghosts?

493
00:28:47,830 --> 00:28:49,404
Only nice ones.

494
00:28:50,285 --> 00:28:52,287
There are matches in the top drawer.

495
00:28:59,929 --> 00:29:01,821
- Wow!
- What?!

496
00:29:02,896 --> 00:29:04,994
So there are condoms in Tree Hill.

497
00:29:06,264 --> 00:29:09,725
Oh, God, um, those are… so not a plan.

498
00:29:09,849 --> 00:29:11,380
They’ve been there since-

499
00:29:12,968 --> 00:29:13,714
What?

500
00:29:13,782 --> 00:29:15,270
I just pictured you and Lucas.

501
00:29:15,358 --> 00:29:19,864
No! No, no, no. I never slept with Lucas. Those are Nathan’s.

502
00:29:21,236 --> 00:29:22,290
I just pictured that, too.

503
00:29:22,378 --> 00:29:26,146
Okay, well stop picturing things coz it’s not like that. It’s…

504
00:29:26,771 --> 00:29:28,337
I’m not like that. I…

505
00:29:30,366 --> 00:29:36,134
I’ve only been with one guy and so I’m kinda freaking out a little bit, coz you’re here.

506
00:29:36,309 --> 00:29:40,430
And… you’re way more experience than I am, hence your daughter; Jenny.

507
00:29:40,537 --> 00:29:41,696
Yeah.

508
00:29:42,315 --> 00:29:45,776
And… It’s still a big deal to me.

509
00:29:47,154 --> 00:29:48,013
Come here.

510
00:29:49,805 --> 00:29:51,755
I’m so happy to be with you right now.

511
00:29:52,197 --> 00:29:54,679
I mean, I could barely think straight most of the week.

512
00:29:54,859 --> 00:29:56,313
Yeah, me too.

513
00:29:56,421 --> 00:29:57,824
Right then, listen to me.

514
00:29:58,617 --> 00:30:01,468
I haven’t felt like this in forever… and…

515
00:30:02,201 --> 00:30:05,657
I know that I might lose cool points by saying this, but…

516
00:30:08,407 --> 00:30:11,817
let’s just… go slow. Okay?

517
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:15,728
Okay.

518
00:30:16,947 --> 00:30:21,811
But… well it’s just that you never really had any cool points.

519
00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:22,672
What-

520
00:30:23,562 --> 00:30:24,863
But, baby…

521
00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:27,218
you do now.

522
00:30:46,587 --> 00:30:47,919
Praying for a miracle?

523
00:30:48,364 --> 00:30:50,459
I’ve decided to tell Keith the truth.

524
00:30:52,619 --> 00:30:54,887
I won’t walk down the aisle before I do.

525
00:30:59,649 --> 00:31:00,630
Well,

526
00:31:04,456 --> 00:31:05,899
maybe you won’t have to.

527
00:31:09,310 --> 00:31:12,459
I don’t know, Jules. Maybe I’m getting soft in my old age…

528
00:31:12,642 --> 00:31:14,026
maybe it’s this church.

529
00:31:14,686 --> 00:31:17,004
Or just seeing you two crazy kids in love…

530
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:20,292
but I think I’ll just let this one go.

531
00:31:22,694 --> 00:31:24,496
Keith doesn’t ever have to know.

532
00:31:25,874 --> 00:31:26,913
If I do what?

533
00:31:27,424 --> 00:31:28,264
Nothing.

534
00:31:29,841 --> 00:31:31,204
Call it my wedding gift.

535
00:31:32,934 --> 00:31:34,040
I don’t believe you.

536
00:31:38,035 --> 00:31:40,128
I’ve kept my word so far, haven’t I?

537
00:31:47,947 --> 00:31:50,542
You couldn’t turn your cellphone off in a church?!

538
00:31:51,805 --> 00:31:52,984
It might be God.

539
00:32:06,988 --> 00:32:09,593
Okay, Anna. I have it cued up.

540
00:32:10,223 --> 00:32:11,432
I didn’t watch it.

541
00:32:12,620 --> 00:32:16,045
You just need to press this button to start it and stop, okay?

542
00:32:17,904 --> 00:32:19,461
Do you wanna know what I said?

543
00:32:20,530 --> 00:32:21,533
You don’t have to.

544
00:32:21,601 --> 00:32:23,273
I said I was bisexual.

545
00:32:26,362 --> 00:32:29,403
It’s just… I thought it would feel liberating…

546
00:32:29,884 --> 00:32:34,370
but, it didn’t. Instead, I just… ended up here.

547
00:32:34,712 --> 00:32:35,797
Back in the closet.

548
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:37,692
Then why’d you tell me?

549
00:32:38,475 --> 00:32:39,479
I don’t know.

550
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:45,253
I guess it’s easier to tell one person than it is to tell your whole world.

551
00:33:01,168 --> 00:33:03,524
You’re okay; just go with the bed spins.

552
00:33:05,427 --> 00:33:06,297
It’s me.

553
00:33:06,929 --> 00:33:08,479
Pick the one in the middle.

554
00:33:09,144 --> 00:33:10,353
What happened?

555
00:33:11,445 --> 00:33:13,968
You got a little sideways. I brought you home.

556
00:33:16,425 --> 00:33:17,505
This your room?

557
00:33:18,182 --> 00:33:18,904
Yeah.

558
00:33:20,573 --> 00:33:21,403
It’s nice.

559
00:33:22,723 --> 00:33:24,936
Well it was until my parents sold everything.

560
00:33:25,319 --> 00:33:27,987
Last week they sold one of the ‘O’s in my first name,

561
00:33:28,074 --> 00:33:30,194
so now I’m officially ‘Broke’ Davis.

562
00:33:34,122 --> 00:33:35,175
Okay.


563
00:33:39,382 --> 00:33:41,175
You hit it pretty hard tonight.

564
00:33:41,658 --> 00:33:43,782
Yeah! Didn’t you?


565
00:33:45,658 --> 00:33:46,982
Not tonight.

566
00:33:47,074 --> 00:33:47,833
How come?

567
00:33:48,984 --> 00:33:50,796
Just didn’t make sense for once.

568
00:33:51,611 --> 00:33:53,971
So instead I carted you here then,

569
00:33:54,165 --> 00:33:57,453
came up with a pretty killer idea for a safe-ride’s program.

570
00:33:58,487 --> 00:34:01,984
Your cab will be here soon. You are my first client.

571
00:34:03,309 --> 00:34:05,024
You’re gonna make a great president.

572
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:06,157
Thanks.

573
00:34:09,291 --> 00:34:10,663
Waste can, behind you.

574
00:34:18,318 --> 00:34:20,421
You should have your mail forwarded here.

575
00:34:21,348 --> 00:34:22,951
They give you the same cell as before?

576
00:34:23,139 --> 00:34:24,587
I don’t know. They redecorated.

577
00:34:26,125 --> 00:34:27,757
Great! Make jokes.

578
00:34:27,841 --> 00:34:30,794
You know how much it’s gonna cost me to get you two idiots out of this mess?

579
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:34,967
Then don’t! Alright? Don’t cut any deals with me like you did with Lucas.

580
00:34:40,318 --> 00:34:42,954
Oh, tell mom Keith says hi.

581
00:34:48,627 --> 00:34:49,565
You told him?

582
00:34:50,063 --> 00:34:51,086
Yeah, I did.

583
00:34:51,924 --> 00:34:52,820
You should have.

584
00:34:53,732 --> 00:34:54,695
You’re brothers.

585
00:34:56,891 --> 00:34:57,572
Go on.

586
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,070
He could use a friend tonight.

587
00:35:14,489 --> 00:35:15,251
Thank you…

588
00:35:17,934 --> 00:35:18,646
dad.

589
00:35:44,876 --> 00:35:47,349
I lost my way, a little bit, this year.

590
00:35:47,426 --> 00:35:49,757
But… lately it’s been better.

591
00:35:49,848 --> 00:35:52,603
You know, um… it’s pretty amazing

592
00:35:52,699 --> 00:35:57,338
how… temptation can be silenced by a ray of hope.

593
00:35:58,065 --> 00:36:01,941
But… when the face to that hope is a boy’s face,

594
00:36:02,152 --> 00:36:06,308
I guess, for me, hope comes with trust issues too.

595
00:36:18,843 --> 00:36:21,212
She still loves you. You know?

596
00:36:25,673 --> 00:36:26,419
Look…

597
00:36:27,399 --> 00:36:28,483
it sucks…

598
00:36:29,375 --> 00:36:30,819
that she kissed Chris…

599
00:36:30,972 --> 00:36:32,461
but Haley married you.

600
00:36:32,615 --> 00:36:35,815
I kinda think that that wins out over some confused kiss.

601
00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:43,009
Maybe I was the confusing part for her.

602
00:36:44,596 --> 00:36:45,400
Nathan,

603
00:36:47,158 --> 00:36:49,834
Haley fell for you when you were a different guy;

604
00:36:51,237 --> 00:36:53,285
a lesser guy.

605
00:36:53,644 --> 00:36:56,229
Maybe you should remember the real Haley,

606
00:36:56,577 --> 00:36:58,103
even when she’s lesser, too.

607
00:37:01,188 --> 00:37:03,192
Let’s get outta here, man.

608
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:08,189
Come on, little brother. Let’s go.

609
00:37:18,230 --> 00:37:19,515
How much do you hate me?

610
00:37:20,702 --> 00:37:22,070
I don’t hate you.

611
00:37:22,930 --> 00:37:24,302
But you hated the party.

612
00:37:26,233 --> 00:37:27,728
I liked my presents.

613
00:37:30,797 --> 00:37:33,622
I was sitting there at a perfectly decent party,

614
00:37:34,164 --> 00:37:36,996
like I have a thousand times before and…

615
00:37:39,007 --> 00:37:44,418
maybe, for the first time, I just felt like I was meant for something more, you know?

616
00:37:45,270 --> 00:37:46,693
More than I planned for you?

617
00:37:50,497 --> 00:37:53,629
‘Let us not seek to fix the blame for the past,

618
00:37:53,959 --> 00:37:57,306
let us accept our own responsibility for the future’.

619
00:37:58,771 --> 00:38:00,153
JFK said that.

620
00:38:01,556 --> 00:38:02,626
Look at you go.

621
00:38:04,397 --> 00:38:06,056
I’m proud of you, girlfriend.

622
00:38:07,259 --> 00:38:08,104
Thanks.

623
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:10,773
I’m proud of me too.

624
00:38:13,231 --> 00:38:14,089
Come here.

625
00:38:21,674 --> 00:38:25,903
You know, after my accident, I asked you what the secret was to getting back.

626
00:38:27,515 --> 00:38:28,743
You remember what you told me?

627
00:38:30,709 --> 00:38:32,419
You told me there is no secret.

628
00:38:35,744 --> 00:38:37,729
Just start shooting one day and…

629
00:38:38,261 --> 00:38:39,327
deal with the pain.

630
00:38:46,561 --> 00:38:49,742
Somewhere along the way… it gets easier.

631
00:38:59,345 --> 00:39:00,078
Hey.

632
00:39:01,307 --> 00:39:02,167
Lucas okay?

633
00:39:02,903 --> 00:39:04,855
I’d say far from.

634
00:39:05,772 --> 00:39:09,028
Well, my investigator found something interesting about Dan.

635
00:39:12,842 --> 00:39:15,404
I just want you to know that I won’t tell anyone.

636
00:39:16,110 --> 00:39:19,243
About you and… you know, girls.

637
00:39:19,944 --> 00:39:20,758
Thanks, Mouth.

638
00:39:22,299 --> 00:39:26,570
But could you, maybe, not hit on Brooke, coz I got enough competition for her already.

639
00:39:28,704 --> 00:39:29,462
Okay.

640
00:39:29,841 --> 00:39:34,649
My name is Anna Tagaro and I’m a junior at Tree Hill High.

641
00:39:34,982 --> 00:39:38,033
And… I’m gay…

642
00:39:39,231 --> 00:39:40,582
and straight…

643
00:39:41,147 --> 00:39:42,969
and a Latina

644
00:39:44,106 --> 00:39:46,045
and I hate labels!

645
00:39:47,131 --> 00:39:51,319
And I hope by the time you see this, those things won’t be an issue.

646
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:53,235
For now…

647
00:39:54,382 --> 00:39:56,384
all you need to know is this;

648
00:39:57,326 --> 00:39:58,961
my name is Anna…

649
00:39:59,804 --> 00:40:04,421
and I’m just trying to find my way… like most kids.

650
00:40:05,478 --> 00:40:07,960
I guess that part is timeless.

651
00:40:25,496 --> 00:40:28,394
So, I’m seeing this girl and...

652
00:40:29,213 --> 00:40:32,736
I think our experience levels are a little different, you know, but…

653
00:40:33,151 --> 00:40:35,546
even so, I’m doing something with her that…

654
00:40:35,859 --> 00:40:37,371
I’ve never done before;

655
00:40:39,321 --> 00:40:41,179
I’m falling in love.

656
00:40:42,336 --> 00:40:43,355
Bring it. Bring it!

657
00:40:43,683 --> 00:40:44,379
Here we go.

658
00:40:48,715 --> 00:40:51,000
My brother’s been going through a tough time lately.

659
00:40:51,172 --> 00:40:53,185
I wish there was more I could do to help him.

660
00:40:53,447 --> 00:40:56,369
I mean, just getting along is kinda new to us.

661
00:40:58,781 --> 00:41:00,527
But I guess that’s how brothers are.

662
00:41:05,781 --> 00:41:09,456
Better to each other and worse to each other than anybody else.

663
00:41:14,147 --> 00:41:17,204
I also wish I could make things easier for my mom.

664
00:41:19,497 --> 00:41:21,766
I mean, even though it’s been a tough year for us,

665
00:41:23,039 --> 00:41:25,087
I want her to be happy more than anything.

666
00:41:28,125 --> 00:41:31,217
But that doesn’t change the fact that I need to get closer to my father

667
00:41:34,181 --> 00:41:36,164
because if I can get closer to him,

668
00:41:37,423 --> 00:41:39,511
maybe I can find a way to beat him.

669
00:41:40,714 --> 00:41:42,221
Once and for all –

670
00:41:44,375 --> 00:41:47,345
set the people that I love free!

671
00:41:50,914 --> 00:41:53,869
I just hope I have the strength to tear him down for good!

672
00:41:57,882 --> 00:42:00,746
I suppose, a fella just wants to fit in;

673
00:42:01,323 --> 00:42:02,592
find a good girl,

674
00:42:03,247 --> 00:42:05,347
maybe, one day, do great things.

675
00:42:05,747 --> 00:42:07,999
Tell us about that steady girl of yours, Brian.

676
00:42:09,750 --> 00:42:11,123
Well her name is Camilla

677
00:42:12,049 --> 00:42:15,500
and my wish is that one day she’ll agree to be my wife…

678
00:42:16,017 --> 00:42:17,389
and we’ll grow old together.

679
00:42:18,726 --> 00:42:21,050
I’d like to have a boy of my own one day.

680
00:42:21,624 --> 00:42:23,411
Maybe lotsa kids.

681
00:42:24,204 --> 00:42:25,965
I’d like to try to teach them;

682
00:42:26,657 --> 00:42:29,754
right from wrong, good from bad.

683
00:42:31,014 --> 00:42:32,878
I’d like to let them teach me.

684
00:42:35,043 --> 00:42:36,785
I think I have something to offer them.

685
00:42:37,932 --> 00:42:39,293
Well, I hope so.

686
00:42:40,522 --> 00:42:42,483
I guess only time will tell.

687
