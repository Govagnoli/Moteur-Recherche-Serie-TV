1
00:02:09,875 --> 00:02:10,547
Brooke.

2
00:02:21,115 --> 00:02:22,604
- Peyton.
- Hey.

3
00:02:23,408 --> 00:02:24,191
What’s the latest?

4
00:02:24,264 --> 00:02:28,944
Boy dates girl, girl doesn’t know what she wants, boy starts dating girl’s best friend, girl ruins everything.

5
00:02:29,061 --> 00:02:31,171
Dark, anything I can do?

6
00:02:31,217 --> 00:02:32,973
No, story pretty much ends there.

7
00:02:33,474 --> 00:02:35,369
- You look like hell. 
- Thanks.

8
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,499
Only have been working on about two hours of sleep.

9
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:41,684
I don’t know what it was, but Jenny, just would not stop crying last night.

10
00:02:41,735 --> 00:02:42,649
You try the key thing?

11
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:45,900
Yeah, yeah I tried that, but as soon as I’d stop she’d start up again.

12
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:48,910
Try a shot of whisky? Always works for me.

13
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:55,280
So hey, listen. My cousin’s getting married downtown this weekend.

14
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:59,048
Is there any chance that you could watch Jenny for a few hours?

15
00:02:59,269 --> 00:03:00,677
You’d really be helping me out.

16
00:03:00,846 --> 00:03:02,029
What’s the pay?

17
00:03:02,387 --> 00:03:05,299
An entire night away from all this drama that you got going on.

18
00:03:07,527 --> 00:03:09,918
Okay. You got yourself a sitter.

19
00:03:10,046 --> 00:03:10,646
Yeah?

20
00:03:12,668 --> 00:03:13,600
Thank you.

21
00:03:17,954 --> 00:03:20,620
So, what’s your mother got planned for you two this weekend?

22
00:03:21,042 --> 00:03:22,616
As little as possible I hope.

23
00:03:22,812 --> 00:03:23,845
Sit. Eat.

24
00:03:24,176 --> 00:03:28,474
Dad, I can’t, I gotta go. I haven’t made it to school on time once since I moved out here.

25
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:30,173
Well, you will now.

26
00:03:36,071 --> 00:03:39,247
Five speed mustang, fully loaded, and she’s all yours.

27
00:03:42,511 --> 00:03:44,478
I know this divorce has been hard on you, Nate.

28
00:03:45,243 --> 00:03:47,535
Just wanted to thank you for sticking by the old man.

29
00:03:50,003 --> 00:03:50,941
What’s the matter?

30
00:03:52,077 --> 00:03:54,156
You’re not supposed to look the gift horse in the mouth, you know.

31
00:03:54,243 --> 00:03:56,956
It’s not a gift, Dad. This is a bribe.

32
00:03:57,059 --> 00:04:01,027
A bribe. Wow. Not exactly the thank you I was expecting.

33
00:04:01,073 --> 00:04:02,624
Okay, thanks for the car, Dad.

34
00:04:02,942 --> 00:04:04,909
Now I can get away from you whenever I want.

35
00:04:17,007 --> 00:04:17,678
Hey.

36
00:04:19,796 --> 00:04:22,915
Lucas told me about Brooke. I was afraid something like this might happen.

37
00:04:23,063 --> 00:04:24,287
Ten points for Haley.

38
00:04:24,714 --> 00:04:25,792
How’s she doing?

39
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:28,710
Who knows. I don’t think she’ll ever speak to me again.

40
00:04:29,034 --> 00:04:30,001
I know I wouldn’t.

41
00:04:41,275 --> 00:04:43,201
What’d you do? Knock over you dad’s dealership?

42
00:04:44,897 --> 00:04:47,450
Okay, none of my business. I’ll see ya.

43
00:04:47,522 --> 00:04:48,317
Okay.

44
00:04:48,572 --> 00:04:49,514
What is this?

45
00:04:49,724 --> 00:04:53,112
Dad gave it to me. His way of showing me who’s in control.

46
00:04:53,206 --> 00:04:54,589
Ew, give it back.

47
00:04:54,665 --> 00:04:57,920
No. If I’m going to live like this, I’m going to take everything I can get.

48
00:04:58,679 --> 00:04:59,483
Okay.

49
00:04:59,761 --> 00:05:01,193
So what’d you do last night?

50
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:05,238
I was up all night bidding on ebay for those Sheryl Crow tickets.

51
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:07,685
Oh yeah. The show’s tomorrow.

52
00:05:07,751 --> 00:05:08,858
- Yeah.
- Any luck?

53
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:10,875
No, but there’s three more auctions tonight.

54
00:05:10,952 --> 00:05:13,241
I got DSL. Do you want to come over?

55
00:05:13,383 --> 00:05:14,341
Oh yeah!

56
00:05:20,916 --> 00:05:23,045
You sure you should be pushing yourself so hard, man?

57
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:26,793
I thought you were supposed to be at physical therapy.

58
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:28,769
Look all they let me do is stretch right now.

59
00:05:29,546 --> 00:05:34,807
You know I figured, I get back in here, I build up some muscle, be back in shape twice as fast.

60
00:05:35,006 --> 00:05:37,044
Or risk messing yourself up for good.

61
00:05:37,121 --> 00:05:38,487
Who’s side are you on anyway? Huh?

62
00:05:39,834 --> 00:05:41,303
I’m on your side, man.

63
00:05:42,212 --> 00:05:45,907
Look, all I’m saying is, dawg, what are you rushing back to?

64
00:05:46,061 --> 00:05:48,134
Look, I worked hard to be a part of this team, Skills.

65
00:05:48,723 --> 00:05:52,132
We’re undefeated. And I’m not giving up my spot now.

66
00:05:53,197 --> 00:05:56,084
Hey gimp. Coach wants to see you at practice, pronto.

67
00:05:56,304 --> 00:05:57,151
Why?

68
00:05:57,243 --> 00:05:58,430
What am I a psychic?

69
00:06:11,148 --> 00:06:14,259
- Brooke, I’m sorry. 
- Yeah, sorry you got caught.

70
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:15,654
We didn’t mean to hurt you.

71
00:06:15,793 --> 00:06:17,784
You did not just say that to me.

72
00:06:17,902 --> 00:06:21,640
Look, we didn’t plan any of this. It just happened.

73
00:06:21,941 --> 00:06:23,078
Go to hell.

74
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:37,476
Tim, if you can’t knock down that shot I’ll find somebody who can.

75
00:06:37,716 --> 00:06:39,355
Now listen up, all of you.

76
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:44,777
As long as we’re a man short, you’re gonna have to work double time to take up the slack.

77
00:06:44,951 --> 00:06:46,499
Alright, let’s play.

78
00:06:47,096 --> 00:06:48,341
You wanted to see me, Coach?

79
00:06:48,812 --> 00:06:51,285
Yeah. How’s that shoulder healing up?

80
00:06:52,262 --> 00:06:55,104
I’m working on it. It should be fine.

81
00:06:55,268 --> 00:06:56,645
Quit working on it.

82
00:06:56,757 --> 00:06:58,508
Coach, I know what I’m doing.

83
00:06:58,571 --> 00:07:01,739
So do I. You’re pushing yourself too hard.

84
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:04,828
From now on I want you court side and out of the weight room.

85
00:07:06,214 --> 00:07:07,801
I’m useless here.

86
00:07:08,653 --> 00:07:12,000
- What’s the point? 
- The point is I’m still your coach.

87
00:07:12,303 --> 00:07:16,767
And I’m going to need you at playoffs. Lay off the weights.

88
00:07:17,494 --> 00:07:18,508
Let’s go!

89
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:24,852
Let’s get moving!

90
00:07:27,029 --> 00:07:29,168
Didn’t expect to see you back in the gym so soon.

91
00:07:29,854 --> 00:07:30,699
I’ll bet.

92
00:07:32,409 --> 00:07:35,415
- Here. 
- No, I can get my own door.

93
00:07:37,273 --> 00:07:39,668
Fine. You’re welcome.

94
00:07:41,366 --> 00:07:42,455
I’m welcome?

95
00:07:43,099 --> 00:07:46,065
Yeah, for the whole rescue thing. Don’t sweat it.

96
00:07:46,162 --> 00:07:49,316
If you think I owe you a thank you, you gotta be kidding me.

97
00:07:49,417 --> 00:07:51,481
Oh what’d I do now? Save your life wrong?

98
00:07:51,542 --> 00:07:53,257
What you did doesn’t change who you are.

99
00:07:54,283 --> 00:07:56,064
Doesn’t make you a good guy.

100
00:07:56,648 --> 00:07:57,483
You’re  right.

101
00:07:58,578 --> 00:08:01,393
I pulled you from that car so I could make your life a living hell.

102
00:08:01,988 --> 00:08:05,956
It was all a big plan so you could live to watch my son take his team to the state championships.

103
00:08:06,472 --> 00:08:08,790
Is that it? Is that what you want to hear?

104
00:08:13,679 --> 00:08:15,566
Nice shot, Nate. That a boy.

105
00:08:25,406 --> 00:08:28,020
Alright, let’s get back to business. Let’s go.

106
00:08:38,368 --> 00:08:39,231
Nathan.

107
00:08:39,308 --> 00:08:41,868
For once I’m with Lucas, Dad. I’ve got nothing to say to you.

108
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,746
You forgot you bag this morning. You nearly drove over it in your brand new Mustang.

109
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,372
I got clothes at home.

110
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,185
What’s  a guy got to do around here to get a little gratitude.

111
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:56,742
You don’t want gratitude, Dad. That car’s an investment. You’re just looking for a return.

112
00:08:56,803 --> 00:08:58,451
You don’t want the car? Just say the word.

113
00:09:01,338 --> 00:09:03,357
Yeah, that’s what I thought.

114
00:09:04,406 --> 00:09:07,902
What do I have to do to prove to you, you made the right choice when you picked me?

115
00:09:08,815 --> 00:09:10,473
It wasn’t a choice, Dad.

116
00:09:11,036 --> 00:09:12,305
It was a lack of one.

117
00:09:19,505 --> 00:09:22,873
Brooke! Sooner or later you’re going to have to talk to me.

118
00:09:22,987 --> 00:09:28,220
Why don’t I just smile at you, you know, Peyton style, pretend everything’s okay and lie to your face.

119
00:09:28,271 --> 00:09:30,314
If I could go back to the way things were then I would.

120
00:09:30,374 --> 00:09:33,764
Back to when my best friend was cheating with my boyfriend and I was too stupid to realize it?

121
00:09:33,831 --> 00:09:34,911
You’re not stupid!

122
00:09:35,379 --> 00:09:36,365
Did you sleep with him?

123
00:09:36,442 --> 00:09:39,084
No! No I didn’t. Okay?

124
00:09:39,141 --> 00:09:40,994
We stopped before it got that far.

125
00:09:41,614 --> 00:09:43,733
God, Brooke, I am sorry, okay?

126
00:09:43,794 --> 00:09:47,035
We were going to tell you and then the accident happened and you liked him so much and I just…

127
00:09:47,117 --> 00:09:48,571
Thought you’d spare me the heartache?

128
00:09:48,708 --> 00:09:49,483
Yeah.

129
00:09:50,445 --> 00:09:53,179
Yeah well that worked out real well, didn’t it?

130
00:09:53,743 --> 00:09:54,500
Brooke!

131
00:09:54,593 --> 00:09:55,729
Are you in love with him?

132
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,667
You know what, I don’t even care.

133
00:10:06,038 --> 00:10:08,514
He’s all yours now, have a great life together.

134
00:10:20,373 --> 00:10:21,238
Hey.

135
00:10:23,418 --> 00:10:25,130
I heard a rumor this place was for sale.

136
00:10:25,737 --> 00:10:27,050
Some financial crisis?

137
00:10:28,004 --> 00:10:30,894
Don’t tell me you’re trying to make good on a certain nephew’s medical expenses.

138
00:10:31,242 --> 00:10:33,499
I don’t have time for your jabs today, Danny.

139
00:10:34,981 --> 00:10:37,623
Tell you what. I’ll buy the place.

140
00:10:38,078 --> 00:10:39,915
- Yeah right.
- No, I’m serious.

141
00:10:40,102 --> 00:10:44,032
I’ll pay you market value for the property. You could pay off your debts with the profits.

142
00:10:44,099 --> 00:10:47,836
Meanwhile you could reopen the service center and run the place at a fair salary.

143
00:10:48,424 --> 00:10:49,792
You want me to work for you?

144
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:53,210
Nope, no, you’ll still be your own boss, I’ll just be the guy behind the curtain.

145
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:57,580
And once this place returns to profitability, I’ll even let you buy it back.

146
00:10:58,150 --> 00:10:59,940
You must really think I’m an idiot.

147
00:11:01,092 --> 00:11:05,204
Don’t be so paranoid, Keith. You did a good thing. I’d hate to see you go down for it.

148
00:11:06,448 --> 00:11:07,431
Since when?

149
00:11:08,772 --> 00:11:10,390
Maybe I turned over a new leaf.

150
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:13,222
Regardless, you should think about this.

151
00:11:13,724 --> 00:11:16,969
Besides, I don’t see anyone breaking down the door with other offers.

152
00:11:26,119 --> 00:11:26,867
Hey.

153
00:11:27,332 --> 00:11:28,055
Hey.

154
00:11:28,204 --> 00:11:29,815
Welcome home. I missed you.

155
00:11:32,954 --> 00:11:34,312
I’ve only been gone a week, Mom.

156
00:11:34,387 --> 00:11:37,204
I’m sorry for the way things ended last time, Nate.

157
00:11:37,439 --> 00:11:38,202
Whatever.

158
00:11:40,739 --> 00:11:41,685
Nice car.

159
00:11:43,168 --> 00:11:44,193
Dan give it to you?

160
00:11:44,628 --> 00:11:46,302
Yeah. So?

161
00:11:46,574 --> 00:11:49,292
I just never considered him as bribing you.

162
00:11:50,019 --> 00:11:51,893
You know, it’s a little hard to compete on that level.

163
00:11:51,970 --> 00:11:53,204
I didn’t want this, Mom.

164
00:11:53,604 --> 00:11:56,423
I gave you a chance to come clean with me, but you didn’t want to do that.

165
00:11:56,552 --> 00:11:59,625
Nathan, you have to believe me. I’m only trying to protect you.

166
00:11:59,687 --> 00:12:03,407
From what? What could be worse than this, Mom?

167
00:12:05,624 --> 00:12:09,353
Fine, you know what? You want to keep your secrets. I guess we all lose.

168
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:15,390
I can’t remember the last time the three of us did this.

169
00:12:16,019 --> 00:12:19,295
Yes, it’s just like old times. Minus one spleen.

170
00:12:21,599 --> 00:12:25,347
Oh come on, it’s a joke. Tragedy plus time. Haha.

171
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:26,941
Alright, too soon.

172
00:12:29,697 --> 00:12:31,533
Do you ever do it at physical therapy?

173
00:12:31,651 --> 00:12:33,274
Physical Therapy’s a waste of time.

174
00:12:33,365 --> 00:12:36,090
Alright, let’s try something else. How was school?

175
00:12:36,157 --> 00:12:40,406
Well let’s see. Brooke hates me, and Peyton won’t talk to me.

176
00:12:40,457 --> 00:12:41,706
See it is like old times.

177
00:12:41,763 --> 00:12:43,186
Oh you know what else? I saw Dan.

178
00:12:43,272 --> 00:12:45,578
He told me the reason he pulled me out of the wreckage,

179
00:12:45,632 --> 00:12:48,224
was just so that you know, he could watch me suffer.

180
00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:50,088
Lucas, I’m sure that’s not true.

181
00:12:50,169 --> 00:12:52,090
Mom, don’t defend him.

182
00:12:52,355 --> 00:12:56,452
I’m not saying that Dan hasn’t don’t some terrible things, but he did save your life.

183
00:12:56,569 --> 00:12:57,681
Whatever that’s worth.

184
00:12:57,763 --> 00:13:00,073
Oh snap out of it already. Come on.

185
00:13:00,245 --> 00:13:03,390
You know what? You’re right. It’s time. Time for a change.

186
00:13:05,008 --> 00:13:06,856
- Where are you going? 
- Out!

187
00:13:07,051 --> 00:13:08,079
- Luke! 
- Don’t wait up.

188
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:34,519
Give me a beer.

189
00:13:34,663 --> 00:13:36,004
Can I see your ID?

190
00:13:43,468 --> 00:13:45,589
- Bottle or draft? 
- Draft’s fine.

191
00:13:58,766 --> 00:13:59,885
What do I owe you?

192
00:14:00,561 --> 00:14:01,442
She got it.

193
00:14:22,776 --> 00:14:26,422
Nice eye contact. You got a name?

194
00:14:27,543 --> 00:14:29,913
- I’m Lucas.
- You mean your name is Lucas.

195
00:14:30,016 --> 00:14:31,275
Yeah that’s what I said.

196
00:14:31,358 --> 00:14:34,221
No, you said you are Lucas, like you’re the only one out there.

197
00:14:34,306 --> 00:14:37,071
I’ve got news for you. It ain’t about you and it ain’t about me.

198
00:14:38,786 --> 00:14:40,973
Okay. Thanks for the beer.

199
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:43,338
Do you believe in magic, Lucas?

200
00:14:45,202 --> 00:14:46,164
No,  not really.

201
00:14:48,003 --> 00:14:49,070
That’s a shame.

202
00:14:50,175 --> 00:14:52,641
Sit down. Let me show you a trick.

203
00:14:54,413 --> 00:14:59,943
I’ll bet you, I can get this drink back in this glass,

204
00:15:01,004 --> 00:15:02,785
without touching the plate.

205
00:15:03,305 --> 00:15:04,202
What’s the bet?

206
00:15:06,885 --> 00:15:08,191
To be decided.

207
00:15:15,328 --> 00:15:16,964
See? Magic.

208
00:15:17,182 --> 00:15:18,175
Not bad.

209
00:15:18,436 --> 00:15:19,839
Yeah I’m full of tricks.

210
00:15:20,423 --> 00:15:22,901
Really? What’s your name?

211
00:15:23,424 --> 00:15:25,188
Buy me a drink. Maybe I’ll tell you.

212
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:13,056
You okay?

213
00:16:13,278 --> 00:16:17,102
Oh um, actually it’s Karen. Lucas’ mom.

214
00:16:17,353 --> 00:16:19,211
Oh, hi.

215
00:16:19,409 --> 00:16:21,608
I’m trying to track Lucas down.

216
00:16:22,328 --> 00:16:25,314
Obviously he’s not answering his cell phone and...

217
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:29,093
I tried the number he had for Brooke but she’s not answering either.

218
00:16:30,036 --> 00:16:31,807
Do you think maybe they’re together?

219
00:16:33,069 --> 00:16:34,976
I don’t really know.

220
00:16:35,228 --> 00:16:39,123
I don’t mean to sound like a dramatic mother but he did just get out of the hospital.

221
00:16:39,328 --> 00:16:43,710
No, yeah, um, I’ll talk to her. See if she knows where he is.

222
00:16:44,207 --> 00:16:45,461
Thank you, Peyton.

223
00:16:46,927 --> 00:16:47,966
Bye.

224
00:16:59,630 --> 00:17:02,691
Oh God, pull it together.

225
00:17:07,563 --> 00:17:08,513
Better.

226
00:17:11,850 --> 00:17:12,775
Hey.

227
00:17:13,350 --> 00:17:14,775
What are you doing here?

228
00:17:15,102 --> 00:17:16,593
You’re not answering your phone.

229
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:19,782
And apparently you’re not getting the message. I don’t want to talk to you.

230
00:17:19,838 --> 00:17:21,717
I can’t believe you actually came over here.

231
00:17:21,779 --> 00:17:24,579
Lucas’ mom called. She can’t find him.

232
00:17:24,893 --> 00:17:26,310
Not my problem.

233
00:17:26,550 --> 00:17:33,103
Okay fine. But if you can figure out where he might be, at least call his mom.

234
00:17:33,519 --> 00:17:34,313
See ya.

235
00:17:36,345 --> 00:17:37,226
Wait.

236
00:17:42,218 --> 00:17:44,225
So. What’s your girlfriend’s name?

237
00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:46,390
Got one, right?

238
00:17:46,601 --> 00:17:47,675
Not anymore.

239
00:17:48,821 --> 00:17:50,231
I had two.

240
00:17:50,617 --> 00:17:54,172
Wow. You ever. What are they like?

241
00:17:54,419 --> 00:17:56,369
One’s all about fun.

242
00:17:57,276 --> 00:18:00,552
The other I kind of had this huge emotional connection to.

243
00:18:01,014 --> 00:18:02,836
But I screwed both those up.

244
00:18:03,471 --> 00:18:07,138
So you got a broken heart. What? You’re in here pouting.

245
00:18:07,686 --> 00:18:09,017
Boohoo.

246
00:18:10,136 --> 00:18:14,402
You know what the Easter bunny and true love have in common?

247
00:18:17,463 --> 00:18:20,573
Doesn’t matter. Cause they don’t exist.

248
00:18:22,795 --> 00:18:24,411
Sounds like you’ve been there.

249
00:18:28,002 --> 00:18:29,650
We all have our tangles.

250
00:18:30,663 --> 00:18:32,225
So you want to get out of here?

251
00:18:32,764 --> 00:18:34,519
I barely even know you.

252
00:18:34,622 --> 00:18:37,473
That’s kind of the point. Come on, live a little...

253
00:18:39,345 --> 00:18:40,520
Lucas

254
00:18:41,098 --> 00:18:42,255
Lucas.

255
00:18:44,421 --> 00:18:45,451
I’m Nikki.

256
00:18:47,355 --> 00:18:48,277
Let’s go.

257
00:18:52,337 --> 00:18:55,296
Yeah, yeah I have a copy right here.

258
00:18:56,429 --> 00:18:58,439
Okay perfect, I’ll send it off to you.

259
00:18:59,259 --> 00:19:01,005
Yeah, yeah, good bye.

260
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:02,639
Hey.

261
00:19:03,543 --> 00:19:06,934
Sorry to drop in on you like this. Has Lucas been by tonight?

262
00:19:07,753 --> 00:19:09,187
Why? Is everything okay?

263
00:19:09,433 --> 00:19:12,449
I’m sure it’s fine. He might even be home right now.

264
00:19:15,053 --> 00:19:18,059
What’s with the for sale sign out front?

265
00:19:18,158 --> 00:19:22,484
Oh, I just, you know, ran into a small skid there for a little while but everything’s okay now.

266
00:19:23,011 --> 00:19:25,673
Selling was just a last resort.

267
00:19:26,482 --> 00:19:29,729
Okay that’s it, I’m just going to take a loan against the café and write you a check.

268
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:33,431
Look, we already talked about it. I won’t cash your check.

269
00:19:33,492 --> 00:19:37,064
Keith, this is your livelihood. I’m not going to let you lose your business on account of my son’s expenses.

270
00:19:37,145 --> 00:19:40,282
Those are expenses he never would have had if it weren’t for me.

271
00:19:40,451 --> 00:19:43,425
And I’m not closing the shop, I’m just restructuring a little bit.

272
00:19:44,335 --> 00:19:45,273
What does that mean?

273
00:19:45,511 --> 00:19:48,206
Means I needed a financial backer and I found one.

274
00:19:49,032 --> 00:19:50,629
What, like a loan shark?

275
00:19:50,897 --> 00:19:54,643
No, it’s totally legit. Closing the deal tomorrow.

276
00:19:55,427 --> 00:19:57,751
Promise me you’re not about to do something stupid.

277
00:19:59,249 --> 00:20:00,628
I promise.

278
00:20:11,234 --> 00:20:12,318
What are we doing here?

279
00:20:12,419 --> 00:20:14,143
Lucas and I had our first date here.

280
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:16,357
So what, you think he came here looking for you?

281
00:20:16,423 --> 00:20:19,715
No, I think he came here cause he knows they’ll take the fake ID I got him.

282
00:20:22,006 --> 00:20:22,926
What are you having ladies?

283
00:20:22,997 --> 00:20:28,620
Actually we’re trying to track somebody down. He’s tall, blondish, kind of a loaner.

284
00:20:28,681 --> 00:20:30,990
Cheats on his girlfriend with skinny blonde bitches.

285
00:20:31,317 --> 00:20:32,117
Nice.

286
00:20:34,164 --> 00:20:35,285
He was wearing this.

287
00:20:36,004 --> 00:20:36,969
On his shoulder.

288
00:20:37,121 --> 00:20:39,305
Right. You just missed him.

289
00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:44,225
But he wasn’t a loaner when he left, if you know what I mean.

290
00:20:45,029 --> 00:20:49,263
Hmm. You know I’m gonna have a beer.

291
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:51,174
Make it two.

292
00:20:51,654 --> 00:20:52,433
You Got it.

293
00:20:54,004 --> 00:20:56,666
Okay, tell me you have that key because you work here.

294
00:20:56,728 --> 00:21:00,768
No, I said I used to work here. Now I just play here.

295
00:21:10,299 --> 00:21:11,243
Come on.

296
00:21:12,862 --> 00:21:16,114
You said you work here. What if we get busted.

297
00:21:16,365 --> 00:21:21,586
What if the ground opens up and swallows us. What if mars attacks.

298
00:21:21,668 --> 00:21:24,131
You can’t worry about all the what if’s in life.

299
00:21:26,389 --> 00:21:27,285
So...

300
00:21:29,614 --> 00:21:31,620
Relax  and enjoy the ride.

301
00:21:35,375 --> 00:21:36,931
What happened to your shoulder?

302
00:21:38,351 --> 00:21:39,604
Car accident.

303
00:21:41,195 --> 00:21:42,378
Can I touch it?

304
00:22:02,703 --> 00:22:07,548
You know they say that you’re never more alive than the moment before you die.

305
00:22:09,004 --> 00:22:10,327
Was it a rush?

306
00:22:12,205 --> 00:22:13,574
I don’t remember.

307
00:22:23,437 --> 00:22:26,396
You have to pay attention to the important moments, Lucas.

308
00:22:28,003 --> 00:22:32,673
Sometimes, they only come around once.

309
00:23:00,991 --> 00:23:04,432
So is this your after school job, high school boy?

310
00:23:05,006 --> 00:23:06,373
You are in high school, right?

311
00:23:07,336 --> 00:23:08,006
Well…

312
00:23:08,135 --> 00:23:10,025
It’s okay. I like them young.

313
00:23:13,001 --> 00:23:15,672
Are you serious? You just had a whole banana split.

314
00:23:15,747 --> 00:23:16,930
What are you, the food police?

315
00:23:17,049 --> 00:23:19,372
I’m just saying, that’s not right.

316
00:23:19,471 --> 00:23:22,239
See that’s your problem. Everything for you breaks down to right and wrong.

317
00:23:22,599 --> 00:23:24,315
You ever think maybe it’s all gray?

318
00:23:24,693 --> 00:23:28,512
Not really. There’s right and there’s wrong.

319
00:23:28,911 --> 00:23:30,037
There’s good and bad.

320
00:23:30,463 --> 00:23:34,354
Okay, give me something’s that bad and I’ll tell you how it might be good.

321
00:23:35,102 --> 00:23:40,421
Okay. A busload of kids crashes.

322
00:23:40,611 --> 00:23:43,596
The kids go to heaven. There’s less pollution from the bus.

323
00:23:44,718 --> 00:23:46,432
Okay. Alright, alright.

324
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,294
What’s the worst thing that’s ever happened to you?

325
00:23:49,351 --> 00:23:51,450
Forget it. I’m not the one in need of the attitude adjustment.

326
00:23:51,543 --> 00:23:53,682
I’ll be the judge of that. Come on.

327
00:23:54,478 --> 00:23:55,874
Tell me your darkest secret.

328
00:24:01,012 --> 00:24:03,031
You have any tabasco in this place?

329
00:24:03,529 --> 00:24:05,632
Yeah. Hold on.

330
00:24:11,764 --> 00:24:16,237
How about red peppers? Oh never mind, got it.

331
00:24:18,664 --> 00:24:19,728
Nikki?

332
00:24:24,802 --> 00:24:25,989
Nikki?

333
00:24:31,189 --> 00:24:32,483
You know, it’s funny.

334
00:24:33,138 --> 00:24:38,077
I look around at all these great looking guys and all I want to do is smash their pretty little faces.

335
00:24:38,529 --> 00:24:41,146
Don’t even ask what I’m thinking when I look at you.

336
00:24:44,567 --> 00:24:47,736
You know, with Lucas I can understand what happened.

337
00:24:47,878 --> 00:24:50,838
Especially given what he’s probably up to tonight.

338
00:24:50,997 --> 00:24:53,460
He’s a guy right? Guy’s screw you over.

339
00:24:53,556 --> 00:24:58,278
But you and I were best friends and I thought that was supposed to mean something.

340
00:24:58,322 --> 00:25:03,698
It does. God, Brooke, you will never know how sorry I am for making you question that.

341
00:25:04,706 --> 00:25:07,648
There was never a point to this whole thing that you weren’t my best friend.

342
00:25:07,718 --> 00:25:10,867
Really?! Well thank you for nothing.

343
00:25:15,384 --> 00:25:16,557
Okay, you know what?

344
00:25:17,790 --> 00:25:23,076
Hard to leave the glow of your love, but I gotta go. I’m babysitting for Jake in the morning.

345
00:25:23,211 --> 00:25:27,087
Playing house with Jake Jaglieski. Don’t waste any time, do you?

346
00:25:27,144 --> 00:25:28,153
It’s a favor.

347
00:25:30,293 --> 00:25:31,782
Brooke, are we ever going to get past this?

348
00:25:31,844 --> 00:25:35,417
I don’t know, Peyton. And right now, I don’t really care.

349
00:25:45,603 --> 00:25:46,661
No.

350
00:25:54,449 --> 00:25:58,284
I know. I know I’m late. You don’t deserve that.

351
00:25:58,341 --> 00:25:59,816
You’re damn right I don’t.

352
00:26:00,512 --> 00:26:01,392
I’m sorry.

353
00:26:01,691 --> 00:26:04,536
You know, you’ve been saying that a lot lately.

354
00:26:06,034 --> 00:26:07,822
What happened tonight, Lucas?

355
00:26:12,084 --> 00:26:16,071
It’s just... I’ve been screwing up a lot, Mom.

356
00:26:17,787 --> 00:26:21,452
I thought I could join the team and deal with it all.

357
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:24,376
You know, basketball and the rest of it.

358
00:26:25,144 --> 00:26:29,599
But ever since I left the river court, I’ve been a mess.

359
00:26:30,428 --> 00:26:32,336
I fought with you and Keith,

360
00:26:33,318 --> 00:26:34,816
and Haley.

361
00:26:35,661 --> 00:26:38,363
And I drove away two girls that I really cared about.

362
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:44,381
Look, Luke... being a teenager is hard.

363
00:26:45,995 --> 00:26:48,308
Honestly, it’s all hard.

364
00:26:50,309 --> 00:26:52,835
But you have a lot of good things going for you.

365
00:26:53,111 --> 00:26:54,415
I know I do.

366
00:26:55,849 --> 00:26:57,191
And you’re one of them.

367
00:27:01,695 --> 00:27:06,351
I think part of being a man, is owning up to your mistakes.

368
00:27:08,669 --> 00:27:11,865
So I promise you, I’m going to do better.

369
00:27:12,474 --> 00:27:13,785
Oh, I know you will.

370
00:27:17,318 --> 00:27:20,442
Well, for a plan B that worked out pretty well.

371
00:27:22,694 --> 00:27:24,132
What was plan A?

372
00:27:25,292 --> 00:27:28,617
I was going to kick you in the ass and ground you for life.

373
00:27:29,519 --> 00:27:31,935
Well, I prefer plan B.

374
00:27:32,626 --> 00:27:33,682
Good night.

375
00:27:35,550 --> 00:27:36,272
Night.

376
00:27:40,010 --> 00:27:40,774
Hey.

377
00:27:42,230 --> 00:27:43,154
What’d you get lost?

378
00:27:44,008 --> 00:27:46,659
I took a little drive, needed to clear my head.

379
00:27:47,884 --> 00:27:48,698
And?

380
00:27:49,261 --> 00:27:50,342
I’m here, aren’t I?

381
00:27:51,878 --> 00:27:53,921
I knew you’d do the right thing for yourself in the end.

382
00:27:53,997 --> 00:27:57,007
Well believe me, if I saw any other way out I’d take it.

383
00:27:58,370 --> 00:28:00,382
Why are you so quick to think the worst of me, Keith?

384
00:28:00,459 --> 00:28:02,240
Because I’ve known you my whole life, Dan.

385
00:28:02,932 --> 00:28:04,160
Feel free to prove me wrong.

386
00:28:05,108 --> 00:28:08,077
Well my lawyers have looked over the contracts, everything’s as we discussed.

387
00:28:08,427 --> 00:28:11,206
All it needs is your signature.

388
00:28:20,498 --> 00:28:22,756
Did I ever tell you what a wonderful job you’ve done?

389
00:28:22,896 --> 00:28:25,716
I think you’ve thanked me a million times.

390
00:28:27,292 --> 00:28:29,495
Actually, it’s more than thanks.

391
00:28:30,998 --> 00:28:34,374
I’ve been thinking, we should partner up.

392
00:28:35,517 --> 00:28:37,149
Business has never been better.

393
00:28:37,865 --> 00:28:42,417
Oh I’m flattered, Karen, but I can’t.

394
00:28:43,349 --> 00:28:49,054
In the past, when things got bad with Dan, I would use work as an excuse to get away from him.

395
00:28:49,212 --> 00:28:53,293
Nathan was always the one to suffer for it. I don’t want that to happen again.

396
00:28:55,188 --> 00:29:00,153
I just hope it’s not too late. Dan is already poisoning him against me.

397
00:29:00,435 --> 00:29:05,653
If Dan is telling lies about you just make sure Nathan knows the facts.

398
00:29:06,656 --> 00:29:11,069
What if what Dan’s telling him isn’t a lie?

399
00:29:11,858 --> 00:29:14,623
Whatever it is, Nathan doesn’t know your side.

400
00:29:15,028 --> 00:29:16,461
You got to talk to him, Deb.

401
00:29:20,003 --> 00:29:22,017
Life is so unfair.

402
00:29:22,356 --> 00:29:23,978
You didn’t get the Sheryl Crow tickets?

403
00:29:24,079 --> 00:29:25,627
No, we got sniped.

404
00:29:25,841 --> 00:29:26,819
I’m sorry.

405
00:29:27,372 --> 00:29:28,847
Haley, do you know where Nathan is?

406
00:29:29,717 --> 00:29:32,893
Um, I think he’s still at your house.

407
00:29:34,013 --> 00:29:35,104
I’m gonna…

408
00:29:37,830 --> 00:29:38,846
How’s Lucas?

409
00:29:39,112 --> 00:29:40,571
I think he’s going to be fine.

410
00:29:44,084 --> 00:29:45,378
- Hey yo.
- Yo.

411
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:50,699
What’s up, dawg? How’s that shoulder feeling, man? Up for a game?

412
00:29:51,384 --> 00:29:53,910
It’s gonna be a while before I’m back on the court, Skills.

413
00:29:54,176 --> 00:29:55,892
Look man, I brought you a little something.

414
00:29:56,731 --> 00:29:58,404
Might help you get back a little quicker.

415
00:29:59,787 --> 00:30:00,995
Remember signing this?

416
00:30:03,075 --> 00:30:04,575
4th grade.

417
00:30:05,374 --> 00:30:08,620
Man we promised each other those signatures would be worth millions one day.

418
00:30:08,727 --> 00:30:09,572
Remember that?

419
00:30:10,304 --> 00:30:11,042
Yep.

420
00:30:11,825 --> 00:30:15,874
It’s your turn to hold on to it. Help keep you focused on that prize.

421
00:30:16,249 --> 00:30:18,153
- Thanks, man.
- Do what you got to do.

422
00:30:18,543 --> 00:30:22,791
Just remember, you always got us. Alright?

423
00:30:23,759 --> 00:30:24,455
Alright.

424
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,325
- Hey.
- Hey.

425
00:30:29,658 --> 00:30:31,828
Nice Suit. What, they got you parking cars?

426
00:30:32,003 --> 00:30:33,155
You’re funny.

427
00:30:34,107 --> 00:30:36,902
Shh, it’s okay, it’s okay, it’s okay.

428
00:30:37,003 --> 00:30:40,205
Come here. Hey Jenny. Hey, remember me?

429
00:30:40,282 --> 00:30:43,876
- It's Peyton.
- Hey. How are you? I missed you.

430
00:30:43,959 --> 00:30:46,805
So I’m sorry you couldn’t meet my parents, they took off for the wedding separately.

431
00:30:46,851 --> 00:30:50,199
- My dad, he likes to get an early start.
- Yeah my dad’s the total opposite.

432
00:30:50,279 --> 00:30:52,867
He’s totally like 3 minutes before the flight kind of guy.

433
00:30:53,003 --> 00:30:56,646
Okay so look, I wrote everything down. When she eats, when she sleeps,

434
00:30:56,712 --> 00:31:00,256
what toys she likes. And I put all my numbers down. My cell, my pager.

435
00:31:00,308 --> 00:31:04,215
I’ve got my moms, my dads, my cousin who’s getting married, I put his number down.

436
00:31:04,286 --> 00:31:07,912
If you need anything at all I’m just going to be less than an hour away so just call anybody…

437
00:31:07,972 --> 00:31:09,647
Jake, we’re going to be cool.

438
00:31:11,003 --> 00:31:11,617
Okay.

439
00:31:12,857 --> 00:31:14,106
I guess I’m a little nervous.

440
00:31:14,254 --> 00:31:17,215
I’ve never left her alone with anybody but my parents before.

441
00:31:18,170 --> 00:31:19,293
And you picked me?

442
00:31:19,774 --> 00:31:20,435
Well I…

443
00:31:20,485 --> 00:31:23,076
I’m just kidding. I’m kidding with you, it’s okay.

444
00:31:23,563 --> 00:31:24,848
Go, have fun at the wedding.

445
00:31:25,007 --> 00:31:29,594
Okay, okay. Alright, I’ll be back in a few hours, okay Angel?

446
00:31:29,835 --> 00:31:31,279
- You be good.
- Take your time.

447
00:31:31,417 --> 00:31:32,533
Alright, thanks Peyton.

448
00:31:33,260 --> 00:31:35,882
Bye. Hey.

449
00:31:36,859 --> 00:31:42,193
Well, if it’s not Mr. Scott. What do I owe this pleasure?

450
00:31:43,321 --> 00:31:45,134
I came to apologize, Coach.

451
00:31:45,649 --> 00:31:46,632
Sit down.

452
00:31:51,065 --> 00:31:53,193
I’ve been kind of screwing up.

453
00:31:54,616 --> 00:31:56,878
I shouldn’t have walked out on practice the other day.

454
00:31:57,169 --> 00:31:58,353
You’re right.

455
00:31:59,834 --> 00:32:02,439
But, you’ve got a lot on your plate.

456
00:32:04,016 --> 00:32:06,269
I’ve been thinking about my position on the team.

457
00:32:06,315 --> 00:32:09,669
That spot’s yours. It will be there when you’re ready.

458
00:32:10,007 --> 00:32:10,836
Yeah, I know but...

459
00:32:10,903 --> 00:32:16,693
If we lose a game or two along the way then so be it.

460
00:32:20,661 --> 00:32:21,875
I appreciate that.

461
00:32:22,919 --> 00:32:24,916
But we both know you need another shooter.

462
00:32:26,555 --> 00:32:29,744
If that means that you’ve got to fill my spot,

463
00:32:30,887 --> 00:32:33,017
then I’m asking you to give someone else a chance.

464
00:32:34,721 --> 00:32:38,361
Look the guys are undefeated. That’s important to me.

465
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:40,481
It’s important to them.

466
00:32:41,506 --> 00:32:43,194
Apology accepted.

467
00:32:45,837 --> 00:32:47,311
Thanks, Coach.

468
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:51,899
Take care of yourself.

469
00:33:00,555 --> 00:33:01,500
Nate.

470
00:33:03,385 --> 00:33:04,740
Can we talk for a minute?

471
00:33:11,756 --> 00:33:16,091
I don’t want to keep secrets from you, Nathan, so I’m telling you this because I love you

472
00:33:16,693 --> 00:33:18,953
and because I think you deserve the truth.

473
00:33:27,543 --> 00:33:31,734
A while ago, your father and I were having serious trouble.

474
00:33:33,430 --> 00:33:35,414
And, I met someone else.

475
00:33:36,894 --> 00:33:39,065
I left your father to be with this man.

476
00:33:39,797 --> 00:33:40,688
When?

477
00:33:41,513 --> 00:33:46,100
A few years back. You were at basketball camp for the summer.

478
00:33:47,436 --> 00:33:50,171
When I came back, Dad told me you were gone on a business trip.

479
00:33:50,232 --> 00:33:53,498
Please understand, I was confused and I was selfish.

480
00:33:54,655 --> 00:33:59,798
As soon as I realized I might risk losing you forever I called it all off and came back.

481
00:34:00,085 --> 00:34:02,739
But Nathan, I have never forgiven myself.

482
00:34:02,913 --> 00:34:05,412
You don’t know how hard it’s been for me to live with this guilt.

483
00:34:05,483 --> 00:34:06,457
Hard for you?

484
00:34:07,297 --> 00:34:11,233
Dad was a nightmare that summer, Mom. You know that.

485
00:34:11,770 --> 00:34:14,512
And all those nights I called you to tell you how he was

486
00:34:14,578 --> 00:34:16,865
you didn’t come home because you were with some guy.

487
00:34:17,444 --> 00:34:20,435
Don’t you see what you did? You gave me to him, Mom.

488
00:34:20,501 --> 00:34:23,696
You knew exactly how he was and you made me dad’s property.

489
00:34:23,763 --> 00:34:25,437
Oh, I never thought that…

490
00:34:25,493 --> 00:34:27,280
Everything he’s turned me into. All of this.

491
00:34:28,790 --> 00:34:30,208
This is your fault.

492
00:34:31,064 --> 00:34:33,496
That’s why I came home. For you.

493
00:34:33,562 --> 00:34:37,853
No, you didn’t come home for me, Mom. You came home because your fling ended.

494
00:34:42,008 --> 00:34:46,250
Just forget it. I don’t want to be a part of this family anymore.

495
00:34:47,207 --> 00:34:48,107
Nathan.

496
00:34:55,003 --> 00:34:58,538
So now I know. I don’t ever remember feeling like this, Haley.

497
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:03,203
I mean, yeah with my dad, but she abandoned me.

498
00:35:03,888 --> 00:35:04,953
I’m sorry.

499
00:35:05,870 --> 00:35:08,630
I can’t go back there. And I can’t live with my dad either.

500
00:35:09,879 --> 00:35:10,899
I’m screwed.

501
00:35:12,687 --> 00:35:13,632
Maybe not.

502
00:35:14,483 --> 00:35:15,855
There might be an answer.

503
00:35:25,374 --> 00:35:27,293
What in the hell are you doing?

504
00:35:27,838 --> 00:35:29,202
Oh, you must be Keith.

505
00:35:30,584 --> 00:35:31,817
Name’s Matt Perry.

506
00:35:32,003 --> 00:35:32,827
Yeah.

507
00:35:35,540 --> 00:35:37,220
I guess I’m your new boss.

508
00:35:37,654 --> 00:35:38,971
Like hell you are.

509
00:35:42,807 --> 00:35:45,678
Hey. You want to tell me what in the hell is going on here?

510
00:35:46,247 --> 00:35:49,124
Dan Scott Service Annex? What are you out of your mind?

511
00:35:49,216 --> 00:35:52,047
Well Dan Scott is a brand name. We wanted to attract the right kind of customer.

512
00:35:52,108 --> 00:35:54,110
There’s a guy out there telling me he’s my boss.

513
00:35:54,184 --> 00:35:57,312
Well, Matt runs my service department so technically you do fall under his jurisdiction.

514
00:35:57,373 --> 00:35:59,799
Yeah, well technically you can kiss my ass.

515
00:36:00,272 --> 00:36:05,830
Come on. What did you expect? A hand out? This was a legitimate business deal.

516
00:36:06,005 --> 00:36:07,418
Yeah? Well I want out.

517
00:36:07,914 --> 00:36:11,785
Well things don’t work that way, Keith. You walk away now, this shop is mine.

518
00:36:17,090 --> 00:36:20,439
Oh no, no. Hey, hey. Remember these?

519
00:36:20,568 --> 00:36:23,535
Okay. Yeah.

520
00:36:24,568 --> 00:36:27,709
Okay, no you don’t want to put those in your mouth because these are gross.

521
00:36:28,338 --> 00:36:32,435
Shh. Oh no.

522
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,624
Who’re you going to be, little girl?

523
00:36:52,494 --> 00:36:53,523
Shh.

524
00:37:02,491 --> 00:37:04,286
Look at this.

525
00:37:05,762 --> 00:37:09,150
I got copies. How was the wedding?

526
00:37:09,263 --> 00:37:11,542
Oh, it was good. I mean it’s a wedding, you know?

527
00:37:12,202 --> 00:37:16,370
My parents were having a good time so they decided to stay downtown.

528
00:37:17,004 --> 00:37:20,193
Alright, then I’ll clear out and you can relax while it’s still quiet.

529
00:37:20,266 --> 00:37:25,709
Well hey, I could order pizza, pop in a movie. It’s the least I could do.

530
00:37:26,624 --> 00:37:29,066
Okay. No chick flicks.

531
00:37:29,851 --> 00:37:31,027
No chick flicks.

532
00:37:44,137 --> 00:37:45,114
What is this?

533
00:37:45,395 --> 00:37:47,746
I’m petitioning for emancipation from you and dad.

534
00:37:48,369 --> 00:37:49,231
What?

535
00:37:50,302 --> 00:37:53,378
I talked to a lawyer. Says I have case.

536
00:37:53,731 --> 00:37:55,215
I’ll be living by myself.

537
00:37:57,009 --> 00:37:58,939
How does it feel to be abandoned, Mom?

538
00:38:13,261 --> 00:38:15,553
I know you don’t have any reason to listen to me.

539
00:38:15,756 --> 00:38:16,704
You’re right I don’t.

540
00:38:17,221 --> 00:38:20,197
Brooke. I’m not asking for forgiveness.

541
00:38:20,573 --> 00:38:24,758
I just want you to know how sorry I am for what I did.

542
00:38:24,851 --> 00:38:26,146
How sorry you are?

543
00:38:28,010 --> 00:38:33,263
Do you know that the entire time that we were dating I actually felt inferior to you?

544
00:38:34,532 --> 00:38:38,484
What a joke. You are just like every other guy on the planet.

545
00:38:38,531 --> 00:38:40,934
You’re a liar and a cheater.

546
00:38:41,792 --> 00:38:44,567
You’re right. I lied to you.

547
00:38:45,612 --> 00:38:47,344
And there’s no excuse for that.

548
00:38:47,968 --> 00:38:48,814
Whatever.

549
00:38:50,128 --> 00:38:52,931
Why don’t you tell it to the girl you hooked up with last night.

550
00:38:55,008 --> 00:38:58,403
As far as excuses, you don’t owe me any. I’m not your girlfriend.

551
00:38:59,187 --> 00:39:02,397
And from here on out, I’m not even your friend.

552
00:39:15,238 --> 00:39:16,344
Sorry we’re…

553
00:39:18,217 --> 00:39:19,724
I was hoping to get a cup of coffee.

554
00:39:19,859 --> 00:39:21,939
Open! We are so open.

555
00:39:22,908 --> 00:39:25,370
Cup of cup, uh cup cup of coffee, yeah.

556
00:39:25,437 --> 00:39:26,962
We can, uh, we can do that for you.

557
00:39:27,505 --> 00:39:31,837
Sheryl Crow. I’m a huge fan.

558
00:39:32,402 --> 00:39:35,641
You have no idea how much it killed me to miss your concert tonight.

559
00:39:35,871 --> 00:39:38,733
We waited on line and everything and then the stupid ebay snipers just…

560
00:39:38,810 --> 00:39:40,893
Haley. Let it go.

561
00:39:41,231 --> 00:39:42,071
Right.

562
00:39:42,333 --> 00:39:44,253
Thanks. How much do I owe you?

563
00:39:46,122 --> 00:39:47,479
One song per cup.

564
00:40:14,156 --> 00:40:17,231
You know the sad thing is, nobody’s going to believe us when we tell them.

565
00:40:18,239 --> 00:40:19,377
I can solve that problem.

566
00:40:46,794 --> 00:40:48,495
What is it? What’s the matter?

567
00:40:50,010 --> 00:40:51,817
He’s leaving us, Dan.

568
00:40:56,756 --> 00:40:58,155
And I don’t blame him.

569
00:42:13,392 --> 00:42:14,763
Hi, Jake.

570
00:42:16,467 --> 00:42:17,476
Nikki.

571
00:42:20,748 --> 00:42:22,861
So, how’s my daughter?

572
