1
00:00:00,786 --> 00:00:02,206
Previously on One Tree Hill.

2
00:00:02,252 --> 00:00:03,311
Were you thinking about college?

3
00:00:03,351 --> 00:00:04,120
It can wait.

4
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:05,128
For what?!

5
00:00:05,191 --> 00:00:07,549
He’s in shock, now that you’re officially off the market.

6
00:00:07,638 --> 00:00:09,430
It’s true ‘Dim’, Haley’s preggers.

7
00:00:09,532 --> 00:00:10,152
Brooke!

8
00:00:10,285 --> 00:00:13,254
The Phoenix Effect isn’t uncommon in cardiac patients.

9
00:00:13,326 --> 00:00:17,641
They grow… remorseful… introspective, sometimes even joyous.

10
00:00:17,713 --> 00:00:19,454
I’ve decided to run the dealership for Dan.

11
00:00:19,588 --> 00:00:23,268
You’ve given up a lot for Dan. He doesn’t deserve a brother like you.

12
00:00:23,347 --> 00:00:24,826
Actually, he deserves better.

13
00:00:24,919 --> 00:00:30,724
We were two, lonely, people... together for one night... No one else needs to know.

14
00:00:30,836 --> 00:00:33,474
Hey, don’t be a stranger, okay?

15
00:00:33,970 --> 00:00:36,629
- You and Haley still married? 
- Yeah, she hasn’t thrown me out yet.

16
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:38,686
I was thinking we could take the cameras, put them out,

17
00:00:38,738 --> 00:00:40,970
people can... take pictures, put them on the wedding wall.

18
00:00:41,042 --> 00:00:44,309
I will not give you my blessing for destroying my son’s life,

19
00:00:44,452 --> 00:00:48,204
or, and you can trust me on this; your own.

20
00:00:48,277 --> 00:00:50,595
I remember the person that you used to be.

21
00:00:51,221 --> 00:00:52,730
Why not just be him again?

22
00:00:53,883 --> 00:00:57,056
Could you ask Lucas to drop by? I’d really like to see your brother.

23
00:01:44,443 --> 00:01:46,375
I think it needs to come down on the left some.

24
00:01:46,445 --> 00:01:48,166
No, it’s gotta come down on the right.

25
00:01:48,319 --> 00:01:49,502
Our left is your right.

26
00:01:49,912 --> 00:01:52,179
Oh… then why are we arguing?

27
00:01:52,757 --> 00:01:54,126
Hey Nathan! What do you think?

28
00:01:54,211 --> 00:01:57,652
- Thai, Mexican, Chinese is always good. 
- Yeah.

29
00:01:57,765 --> 00:02:00,368
Tim, you just ate! How is it possible that you’re still hungry?

30
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:02,895
I’m not ordering food, I’m ordering strippers.

31
00:02:04,734 --> 00:02:08,701
What?! You guys got married so fast, I got screwed outta being the best man

32
00:02:08,752 --> 00:02:10,735
and I am not getting screwed outta the bachelor party.

33
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:11,416
Tim.

34
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:13,628
I was gonna be the best man right?

35
00:02:13,833 --> 00:02:15,440
He’s like a dog with a bone, Hales.

36
00:02:15,616 --> 00:02:17,161
Great, lets get him neutered.

37
00:02:17,278 --> 00:02:20,514
Come on Haley! It’s just a stripper! It’s harmless fun.

38
00:02:20,637 --> 00:02:22,383
You know, Tim’s right.

39
00:02:22,875 --> 00:02:25,055
See… fun!

40
00:02:26,541 --> 00:02:29,279
Yes, but so much more fun when you haven’t seen it before.

41
00:02:29,387 --> 00:02:30,068
Nice!

42
00:02:31,184 --> 00:02:32,941
- Sorry. 
- Yeah.

43
00:02:34,123 --> 00:02:35,833
Haley, let the boys have their fun.

44
00:02:37,686 --> 00:02:40,780
Besides, what’s good for the goose is even better for you.

45
00:02:40,907 --> 00:02:43,887
They can have their little testosterone fest - autos and dial-a-date -

46
00:02:43,968 --> 00:02:47,317
but you get to have a bridal shower and rake in tonnes of loot from all the guests.

47
00:02:47,399 --> 00:02:50,681
- This is so a fair trade. 
- Wow, I so don’t need loot.

48
00:02:51,076 --> 00:02:54,076
Okay, Sunny Hill Lodge?

49
00:02:54,286 --> 00:02:55,367
It’s Kichey.

50
00:02:56,247 --> 00:02:57,809
So’s this thing.

51
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:03,364
Oh no. No, no, that is bridal shower code red. I’m on it.

52
00:03:16,092 --> 00:03:17,536
I’m glad you came son.

53
00:03:17,966 --> 00:03:19,175
You wanted to see me?

54
00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:20,592
Yes I did.

55
00:03:21,163 --> 00:03:24,043
I wanna do something I should’ve done a long time ago.

56
00:03:25,175 --> 00:03:27,960
I wanna apologise to you and to your mother.

57
00:03:30,597 --> 00:03:32,748
I’m sorry Lucas, for everything.

58
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:38,692
- Hey, you okay? 
- Went to go see Dan.

59
00:03:40,631 --> 00:03:43,152
- I’m not gonna hide from him, you know. 
- Yeah, I know.

60
00:03:46,946 --> 00:03:47,876
How’d it go?

61
00:03:48,737 --> 00:03:49,936
He freaked me out.

62
00:03:50,570 --> 00:03:52,072
What did he say this time?

63
00:03:52,971 --> 00:03:54,395
That he was sorry.

64
00:03:55,456 --> 00:03:58,880
You know the scary part is that… it seemed like he meant it.

65
00:03:59,212 --> 00:04:01,927
Do you want me to go talk to him, maybe go see him with you?

66
00:04:02,542 --> 00:04:04,594
No. No I’m okay.

67
00:04:05,218 --> 00:04:06,857
I’m just not gonna run from him anymore.

68
00:04:09,105 --> 00:04:10,831
Sometimes you just gotta let it go.

69
00:04:16,547 --> 00:04:19,750
Man you coulda told me about the strippers instead of just ambushing Haley with it.

70
00:04:19,893 --> 00:04:22,326
- You knew about it. 
- I knew you were talking about it.

71
00:04:22,735 --> 00:04:25,537
I didn’t know you were gonna… order them in front of my wife.

72
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:27,953
Jeez! Did you get married or castrated?

73
00:04:28,812 --> 00:04:33,042
Fine, you want me to cancel the stripper? Tell the boys it’s off?

74
00:04:33,974 --> 00:04:35,197
- No. 
- See?

75
00:04:35,438 --> 00:04:38,243
You’re just as excited as I am. I know you man.

76
00:04:38,531 --> 00:04:39,984
- Whatever. 
- Whatever?

77
00:04:40,518 --> 00:04:43,732
You’re telling me this girl shows up all hot and willing; you wouldn’t go there?

78
00:04:44,546 --> 00:04:46,830
- Tim, I’m married. 
- Right.

79
00:04:47,393 --> 00:04:51,970
You keep telling yourself that. But that ring, doesn’t erase your past Nate.

80
00:04:52,343 --> 00:04:54,617
Some of us still remember who you used to be.

81
00:05:14,995 --> 00:05:17,688
- Ha, looking sharp. 
- Ah! Hey.

82
00:05:17,765 --> 00:05:21,758
- You settling in, okay? 
- Uh! Typical Dan.

83
00:05:22,393 --> 00:05:26,142
He… did everything himself. Never let anyone help him with the big stuff.

84
00:05:27,426 --> 00:05:29,428
- Anything I can do to help? 
- Yeah.

85
00:05:29,695 --> 00:05:32,464
You can come back and work for me like old times. What do you say?

86
00:05:32,536 --> 00:05:34,972
Well I would say thank you but I don’t know.

87
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:38,404
I… you know, it might be a little strange; getting a cheque with Dan’s name on it.

88
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:40,289
No. Actually it feels pretty good.

89
00:05:41,209 --> 00:05:44,753
- Well, the job’s yours if you want it. 
- Thanks Keith.

90
00:05:45,158 --> 00:05:46,786
You know, I’ll let you get back to work.

91
00:05:46,893 --> 00:05:48,894
Yeah, that’s exactly what I’ve been avoiding.

92
00:05:49,842 --> 00:05:52,684
I have to get Dan’s signature on these and…

93
00:05:53,191 --> 00:05:56,585
despite me best efforts, I’m all out of excuses not to.

94
00:05:57,435 --> 00:05:59,196
Are you guys still having problems?

95
00:05:59,996 --> 00:06:02,279
Um… actually no.

96
00:06:02,755 --> 00:06:07,051
I don’ know what drugs they’re pumping him full of but he’s kind of... polite.

97
00:06:07,178 --> 00:06:08,526
Yeah, I know what you mean.

98
00:06:08,847 --> 00:06:13,133
I didn’t think that we’d ever be able to put aside our differences, like you and Nathan have,

99
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:17,456
but… well, who knows? Maybe they’ll keep him medicated.

100
00:06:18,232 --> 00:06:19,062
This is Keith.

101
00:06:19,862 --> 00:06:20,434
Yeah.

102
00:06:21,413 --> 00:06:23,383
Okay, I’ll be right there.

103
00:06:23,952 --> 00:06:26,117
I… gotta run.

104
00:06:28,438 --> 00:06:33,496
You know, if you want, I can take those papers to the hospital.

105
00:06:33,783 --> 00:06:34,714
Are you sure?

106
00:06:36,496 --> 00:06:39,347
Yeah. No problem.

107
00:06:39,747 --> 00:06:41,794
Alright. I’ll see you.

108
00:06:41,876 --> 00:06:42,573
Okay.

109
00:06:52,493 --> 00:06:53,376
Need some help?

110
00:06:53,551 --> 00:06:56,849
Nope. Just… straightening up for your… party.

111
00:06:57,480 --> 00:07:00,688
Haley you don’t need to, it’s just the guys. They’ve seen it like this.

112
00:07:01,569 --> 00:07:02,870
In fact, they made it like this.

113
00:07:03,115 --> 00:07:04,502
Oh, I don’t mind.

114
00:07:04,835 --> 00:07:08,266
Besides, if we’re going to have a skanky ho in the place at least it should look nice.

115
00:07:09,182 --> 00:07:12,254
I’m kidding… sort of… maybe.

116
00:07:12,418 --> 00:07:16,146
Haley, this bachelor party is more for Tim than it is for me, okay?

117
00:07:16,304 --> 00:07:18,557
He’s threatened by the fact that Lucas threw a suerception

118
00:07:18,614 --> 00:07:21,363
so this is just his way of proving that he’s still my best friend.

119
00:07:21,522 --> 00:07:24,021
Yeah, what’s next? Lap dances for world peace?

120
00:07:24,716 --> 00:07:26,436
Look, I’m not getting all tweaked about your shower.

121
00:07:26,514 --> 00:07:30,411
It’s a bridal shower Nathan. It’s gonna be like the most boring thing ever!

122
00:07:30,501 --> 00:07:34,184
- Your shower is gonna totally kill. 
- Normally, killing’s not good.

123
00:07:34,281 --> 00:07:37,558
No, no, but this time, it is. Eyes forward.

124
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:39,024
What’s that for?

125
00:07:39,109 --> 00:07:41,024
Don’t worry about it. Just leave the shower to me, okay?

126
00:07:41,112 --> 00:07:45,034
I’m gonna teach Haley James… Scott… whoever you are right now,

127
00:07:45,089 --> 00:07:49,027
how to have some serious fun. Tomorrow night, I’m tutor girl.

128
00:07:55,347 --> 00:07:56,261
Hey.

129
00:07:58,095 --> 00:08:00,327
Oh. Hi Karen.

130
00:08:01,438 --> 00:08:04,407
You look fantastic. It’s a whole new you.

131
00:08:04,966 --> 00:08:06,994
Yep. Thanks.

132
00:08:08,412 --> 00:08:11,325
So, how are things going at the dealership?

133
00:08:12,318 --> 00:08:15,698
Good yeah, yeah. I think it, you know, it’s gonna be, okay.

134
00:08:16,145 --> 00:08:17,220
Oh good.

135
00:08:22,418 --> 00:08:24,015
Oh you know what; I’d better be getting back.

136
00:08:25,512 --> 00:08:26,687
See you around, huh?

137
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:28,981
Okay.

138
00:08:40,302 --> 00:08:41,899
Hey, good to see you Lucas.

139
00:08:42,574 --> 00:08:45,883
Um… Keith needs some signatures from you.

140
00:09:00,867 --> 00:09:02,134
You know, I was thinking.

141
00:09:03,618 --> 00:09:06,946
My doctor’s put me through some cardiovascular rehab; I thought you might like to join me.

142
00:09:09,021 --> 00:09:10,581
So you wanna be workout buddies?

143
00:09:11,514 --> 00:09:14,386
Give us a chance to spend some time together. Get to know you.

144
00:09:16,541 --> 00:09:18,191
You had my whole life to do that.

145
00:09:19,716 --> 00:09:21,487
Well life’s given me a second chance.

146
00:09:22,383 --> 00:09:23,551
Maybe you will too.

147
00:09:25,706 --> 00:09:27,688
Do you think we’d even be having this conversation

148
00:09:28,046 --> 00:09:29,567
if you weren’t on the odds with Nathan?

149
00:09:30,796 --> 00:09:31,844
That’s not it.

150
00:09:32,757 --> 00:09:34,405
But I understand your trepidation.

151
00:09:36,637 --> 00:09:39,792
I know I haven’t exactly given you a lot of reasons to trust me in the past.

152
00:09:43,588 --> 00:09:47,385
Look, would you do me a favour and put a copy of this

153
00:09:47,451 --> 00:09:49,914
in the lockbox in my bottom desk drawer.

154
00:09:50,822 --> 00:09:52,612
There’s a key taped underneath the drawer.

155
00:09:54,403 --> 00:09:55,120
Yeah.

156
00:09:57,456 --> 00:09:58,229
Lucas?

157
00:10:01,762 --> 00:10:02,889
You might not trust me…

158
00:10:04,618 --> 00:10:05,612
but I trust you.

159
00:11:20,437 --> 00:11:22,029
My nose is starting to itch.

160
00:11:23,106 --> 00:11:26,258
- Alright. 
- Ah, hi, am I interrupting something?

161
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:27,538
- Hi Haley. 
- Hi.

162
00:11:27,897 --> 00:11:30,674
This is some… weird guy thing I’m never gonna understand right?

163
00:11:30,779 --> 00:11:33,329
- Pretty much. 
- Great, well at least I came to the right place.

164
00:11:33,852 --> 00:11:35,285
Can I talk to you for a second?

165
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:36,949
Yeah.

166
00:11:37,589 --> 00:11:39,351
Yeah, we gotta go get eggs anyway.

167
00:11:40,409 --> 00:11:41,905
- Let’s roll. 
- Eggs?

168
00:11:42,586 --> 00:11:43,432
So what’s up?

169
00:11:45,694 --> 00:11:48,894
Oh. Um uh, yo Fergie!

170
00:11:51,356 --> 00:11:52,113
Sorry.

171
00:11:52,625 --> 00:11:56,314
Hey, how bout you guys roll me down the street and see if you can hit me on the fly.

172
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:57,501
Ow.

173
00:12:00,879 --> 00:12:03,490
So you know bout this whole Bachelor party thing right?

174
00:12:03,558 --> 00:12:06,378
Oh Haley! Look, it’s just goofy guy stuff, okay?

175
00:12:06,466 --> 00:12:09,866
I know. I just wish he’d done his goofy guy stuff before we got married.

176
00:12:09,952 --> 00:12:12,692
Well he would’ve, if you’da gotten married ten years from now.

177
00:12:13,691 --> 00:12:15,078
Joking! Sorry!

178
00:12:16,506 --> 00:12:17,587
Would you just...

179
00:12:19,215 --> 00:12:20,490
look after him?

180
00:12:22,322 --> 00:12:23,259
I’ll tell you what;

181
00:12:23,945 --> 00:12:28,917
I will sacrifice myself and go to the bachelor party to take care of Nathan.

182
00:12:29,004 --> 00:12:30,587
Oh, you’re so heroic.

183
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,137
Thank you.

184
00:12:33,965 --> 00:12:37,821
Hey yo, check it out, we got these trash can set up like bowling pins right.

185
00:12:37,913 --> 00:12:41,558
So I figured we just gonna roll Mouth’s squirrelly little ass right on into em.

186
00:12:44,016 --> 00:12:46,289
Oh-ho, I so got next.

187
00:12:46,494 --> 00:12:49,126
Medication will treat the symptoms but…

188
00:12:49,285 --> 00:12:52,649
the best treatment for you now is a radical lifestyle change.

189
00:12:53,309 --> 00:12:55,996
So we’re gonna put you on a physical therapy regiment

190
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:59,315
and you can start that as soon as you’re released; the day after tomorrow.

191
00:12:59,719 --> 00:13:02,243
So what are we talking about doc? Weights? Treadmill?

192
00:13:02,325 --> 00:13:05,955
More like, some stretching, short walks,

193
00:13:06,438 --> 00:13:09,270
you have to understand Dan, you’re looking at a long road back

194
00:13:09,703 --> 00:13:12,141
and the road is called the rest of your life.

195
00:13:16,697 --> 00:13:20,041
The hospital gave me the name of their best physical therapist

196
00:13:20,819 --> 00:13:23,891
and there’s also a nurse who can move in with you at the beach house...

197
00:13:23,979 --> 00:13:25,412
I wanna come home Deb.

198
00:13:32,795 --> 00:13:34,970
- Dude, smell me. 
- Dude, kiss my ass.

199
00:13:35,052 --> 00:13:38,560
No seriously. I wanna smell nice for the… talent that’s coming over later.

200
00:13:38,622 --> 00:13:41,371
- Tim, just say the stripper. 
- Fine, the stripper.

201
00:13:41,637 --> 00:13:43,727
Alright, which one makes me smell available?

202
00:13:43,799 --> 00:13:46,968
I’ve got ‘Flesh’ on this side and uh this ‘Frink’ stuff on this side.

203
00:13:47,695 --> 00:13:48,534
That’s not mine.

204
00:13:49,011 --> 00:13:50,465
Well it was in your bathroom.

205
00:13:50,609 --> 00:13:53,311
Oh Tim. What’re you doing with my perfume.

206
00:13:54,223 --> 00:13:56,035
Alright. I’m off.

207
00:13:57,238 --> 00:14:01,335
All the important numbers are by the phone… police, fire, pimps.

208
00:14:01,678 --> 00:14:04,222
- Thanks for worrying about us. 
- I’m not worried about you.

209
00:14:04,463 --> 00:14:06,004
Have your fun, just remember...

210
00:14:08,676 --> 00:14:11,313
- You’re married now. 
- She’s here!

211
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:12,911
Stripper time.

212
00:14:14,498 --> 00:14:16,061
Oh it’s just you.

213
00:14:17,259 --> 00:14:18,789
Not the thrill it used to be, huh?

214
00:14:20,012 --> 00:14:20,821
- Hi. 
- Hi.

215
00:14:23,018 --> 00:14:26,791
Okay, I left some ones on the counter, in case you don’t have any change

216
00:14:26,853 --> 00:14:29,065
don’t spend it all in one place.

217
00:14:33,796 --> 00:14:35,249
What’s wrong with ‘Dim’?

218
00:14:35,669 --> 00:14:38,711
Oh, don’t take it personally. He thought you were the stripper.

219
00:14:39,330 --> 00:14:42,331
Hey, we’d prefer to be called exotic dancers.

220
00:14:42,679 --> 00:14:43,447
Nice.

221
00:14:47,584 --> 00:14:48,828
Who the hell are you?

222
00:14:48,918 --> 00:14:49,903
Where’s the stripper?

223
00:14:55,372 --> 00:15:01,634
Haha! I can not believe you rented this for my shower; Brooke this is crazy.

224
00:15:02,325 --> 00:15:04,491
And by crazy, she means, thank you.

225
00:15:04,593 --> 00:15:08,582
Oh yeah god, Brooke, thank you. I’m blown away by all this.

226
00:15:08,679 --> 00:15:09,570
You’re welcome.

227
00:15:09,877 --> 00:15:13,629
I think someone feels a little guilty about the whole pregnancy rumour.

228
00:15:14,827 --> 00:15:16,308
Well, water under the bridge.

229
00:15:16,871 --> 00:15:19,288
- Forget the water, lets have champagne. 
- Yes.

230
00:15:19,426 --> 00:15:21,644
Champagne? How much is that gonna cost?

231
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:23,466
Who cares? It’s on my dad’s credit card.

232
00:15:25,002 --> 00:15:29,057
I dunno you guys. Last time I drank, I… threw up in Dan’s lap.

233
00:15:32,543 --> 00:15:33,968
That’s my girl.

234
00:15:34,423 --> 00:15:38,969
Alright, a toast to… a nice normal bridal shower.

235
00:15:39,052 --> 00:15:40,115
To nice.

236
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:41,627
And normal.

237
00:15:47,605 --> 00:15:51,943
- What’s that? 
- It’s just a... nice and normal blindfold.

238
00:15:52,450 --> 00:15:55,901
- For what? 
- For the nice, normal, guest of honour.

239
00:16:04,755 --> 00:16:05,937
Sure you know this guy?

240
00:16:06,634 --> 00:16:08,394
He works with me in ‘Hot and Twisted’.

241
00:16:09,536 --> 00:16:11,687
Great. Even losers don’t know me.

242
00:16:11,758 --> 00:16:13,439
Just read the damn quiz.

243
00:16:15,066 --> 00:16:19,505
- When your boyfriend kisses you, he; A. 
- What the hell are you reading?

244
00:16:19,577 --> 00:16:20,460
Cosmo Girl.

245
00:16:22,805 --> 00:16:26,744
When your boyfriend kisses you, he; A, looks deeply into your eyes.

246
00:16:26,821 --> 00:16:28,599
B, closes his eyes.

247
00:16:28,716 --> 00:16:31,152
C, cradles your head softly.

248
00:16:31,275 --> 00:16:32,924
D, unhooks your bra.

249
00:16:33,262 --> 00:16:35,982
It’s D. It’s definitely D, you go for the bra.

250
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:38,971
Now Tim, you realise you’re supposed to be answering as a girl.

251
00:16:39,068 --> 00:16:42,223
I know, and I’d want a boyfriend who isn’t afraid to go up my shirt.

252
00:16:42,294 --> 00:16:44,287
And hopefully, someday, you’ll find him.

253
00:16:44,378 --> 00:16:48,172
Okay, this sucks. What kind of bachelor party is this? Hmm?

254
00:16:48,259 --> 00:16:50,046
No booze, no strippers.

255
00:16:50,471 --> 00:16:53,031
I thought you guys throw, like, the best parties. This is… lame.

256
00:16:53,128 --> 00:16:56,001
Dude, my brother’s settin up the stripper so we aint gonna be disappointed.

257
00:16:56,076 --> 00:16:57,649
I just hope the stripper’s not a guy,

258
00:16:58,024 --> 00:16:59,943
I remember the last time you were on stripper duty.

259
00:17:00,025 --> 00:17:03,169
Alright. I wasn’t gonna crack this out till later but what the hell.

260
00:17:03,876 --> 00:17:07,623
Let’s set the mood with a little something from my dad’s porno stash.

261
00:17:11,201 --> 00:17:14,744
I was up late one night and I heard my dad watching this.

262
00:17:15,237 --> 00:17:18,611
- The chick in it goes absolutely nuts. 
- Sweet!

263
00:17:30,361 --> 00:17:33,295
- Tim, is that your mom? 
- Step mom.

264
00:17:34,909 --> 00:17:38,144
- Dude, your mom’s a slut! 
- Hehe, step mom!

265
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:43,131
Can you see?

266
00:17:44,187 --> 00:17:45,358
What is going on?

267
00:17:50,231 --> 00:17:51,974
What is this?

268
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:54,877
This is a lingerie fashion show, girlie.

269
00:17:54,993 --> 00:17:57,565
We figured that since you’re married now, you need to wear

270
00:17:57,658 --> 00:18:01,368
something a little less conservative for Nathan. Something a little more…

271
00:18:01,743 --> 00:18:03,397
- Slutty. 
- That’s it.

272
00:18:05,147 --> 00:18:11,347
- Hit it girls! 
- Woah, sugar, spice. Look, that’s cute.

273
00:18:13,424 --> 00:18:18,023
Oh my. Go baby, go baby.

274
00:18:27,470 --> 00:18:31,111
Yeah, Teresa! I call that red hot!

275
00:18:39,008 --> 00:18:40,378
Okay.

276
00:18:42,208 --> 00:18:43,378
How’d you...

277
00:18:43,870 --> 00:18:47,096
After all the money that I spend in this place, they owed me a few favours.

278
00:18:55,802 --> 00:18:57,428
- Hey. 
- Hey.

279
00:18:59,768 --> 00:19:03,768
Want some coffee? It’s not the fancy competition but...

280
00:19:04,561 --> 00:19:06,495
I love your coffee Karen. You know that.

281
00:19:06,902 --> 00:19:09,076
So, it’s not the coffee you’re avoiding.

282
00:19:11,093 --> 00:19:16,254
I’m just having a hard time being around you right now.

283
00:19:16,438 --> 00:19:18,937
But, before the proposal we were friends, Keith.

284
00:19:18,999 --> 00:19:21,482
I mean can’t we at least try to go back to the way we were then?

285
00:19:22,926 --> 00:19:24,241
I don’t think so.

286
00:19:25,946 --> 00:19:29,381
Sometimes it’s just… better to move on.

287
00:19:30,124 --> 00:19:33,231
You know, kinda like you did with Peyton’s dad.

288
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:36,914
I haven’t seen Larry in ages. There’s nothing there.

289
00:19:38,034 --> 00:19:40,948
But even if there was, I mean, your idea of moving on;

290
00:19:41,010 --> 00:19:43,262
does it mean cutting me out of your life completely?

291
00:19:45,798 --> 00:19:46,862
I don’t want to,

292
00:19:49,048 --> 00:19:50,344
but I have to.

293
00:20:00,292 --> 00:20:03,297
Haley. Are you coming out, kitten?

294
00:20:03,379 --> 00:20:04,762
I am not coming out.

295
00:20:04,986 --> 00:20:08,063
See, if you don’t come out, then we’re coming in.

296
00:20:12,443 --> 00:20:14,126
Sexy schoolgirl look.

297
00:20:14,704 --> 00:20:15,698
I don’t know.

298
00:20:15,955 --> 00:20:19,773
Nathan Scott, is going to blow a fuse when he sees you in this.

299
00:20:19,912 --> 00:20:22,609
Guys, there is no way I can pull this off!

300
00:20:22,738 --> 00:20:25,236
No, actually, I’d leave that up to Nathan.

301
00:20:25,984 --> 00:20:27,971
Specially after our next stop.

302
00:20:30,432 --> 00:20:33,127
I still can’t believe you pulled off this keg dawg.

303
00:20:33,301 --> 00:20:35,641
Well you can thank Brooke and the fake ID she made.

304
00:20:35,769 --> 00:20:37,346
Tell the truth, you get with that or what?

305
00:20:37,442 --> 00:20:38,871
A gentleman never tells.

306
00:20:38,959 --> 00:20:40,817
Man, that’s just ‘Mouth’ for no!

307
00:20:45,927 --> 00:20:47,924
Are you seeing what I’m seeing?

308
00:20:49,567 --> 00:20:52,050
What is wrong with youth of America today?

309
00:20:52,430 --> 00:20:55,246
Hm, time to protect and serve.

310
00:21:06,679 --> 00:21:09,772
Okay! Okay, okay, okay everybody.

311
00:21:09,991 --> 00:21:13,965
This is a very important moment in our little Haley’s life.

312
00:21:14,436 --> 00:21:17,431
The moment when she becomes a woman.

313
00:21:18,086 --> 00:21:21,771
At least, according to the State of North Dakota!

314
00:21:22,451 --> 00:21:24,543
It’s your very first fake ID.

315
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:28,644
Trudy Gill. Oh I get it, Trudy Gi- Tutor Girl.

316
00:21:29,698 --> 00:21:32,555
Woah! Hey, why are we stopping?

317
00:21:32,714 --> 00:21:35,847
What do you mean it’s gonna take at least an hour to send somebody out?

318
00:21:35,986 --> 00:21:39,011
Let me explain to you the law of supply and demand;

319
00:21:39,113 --> 00:21:43,839
if I supply the credit card, I get to demand that you get somebody out here to fix the car!

320
00:21:43,913 --> 00:21:46,063
- Brooke. I really... I could just call Lucas. 
- No!

321
00:21:46,235 --> 00:21:47,761
I already tried, his phone’s off.

322
00:21:49,778 --> 00:21:51,101
Oh good!

323
00:21:59,737 --> 00:22:00,996
What seems to be the trouble?

324
00:22:01,145 --> 00:22:03,066
Um… it’s probably the engine.

325
00:22:05,257 --> 00:22:07,643
Oh, I see exactly what the trouble is.

326
00:22:07,867 --> 00:22:09,512
Great, can you fix it?

327
00:22:09,619 --> 00:22:11,615
Sure, I gotta tool that can fix anything.

328
00:22:22,384 --> 00:22:23,979
I am gonna kill you.

329
00:22:28,189 --> 00:22:30,319
Nice performance Cameron Diaz.

330
00:22:30,493 --> 00:22:31,835
Hm, you too Gwyneth.

331
00:22:34,030 --> 00:22:35,228
This must be the stripper!

332
00:22:37,430 --> 00:22:42,858
Oh sweet, they’re in costume. Did my brother deliver or what!

333
00:22:43,146 --> 00:22:45,644
We witnessed a keg being brought up to this apartment.

334
00:22:45,981 --> 00:22:47,205
Are you boys of age?

335
00:22:48,578 --> 00:22:49,907
Let’s see some ID.

336
00:22:50,036 --> 00:22:51,961
Let’s see some hot girl on girl!

337
00:22:53,671 --> 00:22:55,904
Damn these strippers a strong!

338
00:22:57,436 --> 00:22:59,431
I can feel your breasts against my back!

339
00:22:59,917 --> 00:23:04,101
Better yet! Forget the keg! Arrest the perv.

340
00:23:04,341 --> 00:23:06,230
Ow! You’re hurting me!

341
00:23:06,873 --> 00:23:08,521
Does that cost extra?

342
00:23:19,012 --> 00:23:19,713
Hey.

343
00:23:20,966 --> 00:23:22,062
A moonroof.

344
00:23:34,299 --> 00:23:37,377
- Officer, there’s been a misunderstanding. 
- He thought you were a stripper.

345
00:23:37,663 --> 00:23:40,700
I can see your thong strap foxy brown!

346
00:23:44,905 --> 00:23:46,848
- Never mind. 
- Yeah, take him.

347
00:23:52,787 --> 00:23:55,808
I’ve never been so horny!

348
00:24:03,141 --> 00:24:05,065
Hey, its girls gone wild!

349
00:24:09,791 --> 00:24:10,723
Haley?

350
00:24:19,182 --> 00:24:20,616
Sorry, we’re close...

351
00:24:21,465 --> 00:24:26,856
Oh. Hey. Is everything alright? Is Dan okay?

352
00:24:27,430 --> 00:24:29,370
Oh, the doctors are ready to release him.

353
00:24:29,478 --> 00:24:31,383
- Well that’s good news. 
- Yeah.

354
00:24:33,503 --> 00:24:34,976
Let me grab some coffee.

355
00:24:35,950 --> 00:24:37,660
Dan says he wants to come home.

356
00:24:38,448 --> 00:24:39,794
Let me grab some liquor.

357
00:24:44,617 --> 00:24:45,668
I’m confused.

358
00:24:47,752 --> 00:24:49,276
I thought the divorce went through.

359
00:24:50,117 --> 00:24:54,495
Well technically no. Dan had the heart attack before signing the paper.

360
00:24:54,607 --> 00:24:57,157
While signing the papers actually.

361
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:01,596
You know, Dan has a team of doctors who are taking care of him.

362
00:25:02,017 --> 00:25:03,470
Who’s taking care of you?

363
00:25:05,251 --> 00:25:08,037
Right now, whoever’s name is on that bottle.

364
00:25:11,643 --> 00:25:13,474
You know, maybe the heart attack is a sign.

365
00:25:13,741 --> 00:25:17,838
It is a sign. It’s a sign that you’ve gotta stop doing what’s best for Dan

366
00:25:17,884 --> 00:25:19,669
and start doing what’s best for you.

367
00:25:20,355 --> 00:25:24,821
Maybe it’s moving on. Maybe it’s trying to put the pieces back together

368
00:25:24,903 --> 00:25:28,958
but either way, do it because it’s right for you.

369
00:25:45,967 --> 00:25:49,152
Oh, if I wanted a lap dance, I would have stayed at home.

370
00:25:49,232 --> 00:25:53,703
No, tonight’s gonna be a little different. I rented out the back room and hired an instructor.

371
00:25:53,790 --> 00:25:55,397
An instructor for what?

372
00:25:56,540 --> 00:25:59,108
Stripping is not just about taking your clothes off,

373
00:25:59,171 --> 00:26:01,414
it’s about getting in touch with your own body.

374
00:26:02,719 --> 00:26:09,984
Once you do that, you’re gonna find an inner confidence that you never… had… before.

375
00:26:10,425 --> 00:26:14,210
I think you’ll be amazed at just how… empowering it is.

376
00:26:14,705 --> 00:26:18,186
- Clearly!
- So. Where’s Haley?

377
00:26:18,791 --> 00:26:20,681
She’s not gonna go for this.

378
00:26:20,921 --> 00:26:24,096
Haley, just take it nice and easy.

379
00:26:24,203 --> 00:26:26,200
Show me the pole! Woah!

380
00:26:27,106 --> 00:26:27,756
Haley!

381
00:26:29,241 --> 00:26:31,160
That’s gonna leave a mark.

382
00:26:32,117 --> 00:26:33,368
Oh my god.

383
00:26:34,622 --> 00:26:35,723
So look, I know…

384
00:26:36,788 --> 00:26:39,481
we haven’t really taken the training wheels off this whole brother thing,

385
00:26:39,741 --> 00:26:41,007
but I wanna ask you something.

386
00:26:41,744 --> 00:26:43,372
I went down to the dealership today

387
00:26:43,964 --> 00:26:46,653
and… found some pictures.

388
00:26:47,012 --> 00:26:48,445
The ones of you in his desk.

389
00:26:49,609 --> 00:26:51,050
You know about those?

390
00:26:51,171 --> 00:26:53,474
Its part of the reason I hated you all those years.

391
00:26:56,801 --> 00:27:00,902
Well, he said he wants me to help him with his rehab.

392
00:27:01,410 --> 00:27:02,471
And what’d you say?

393
00:27:04,625 --> 00:27:06,516
Said I wouldn’t be a stand-in Nathan.

394
00:27:07,764 --> 00:27:09,458
- Night man. 
- Take it easy.

395
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:10,441
Alright guys.

396
00:27:10,539 --> 00:27:12,428
Yeah, we should probably go bail Tim out.

397
00:27:12,517 --> 00:27:14,743
Well, it looks like we got ‘Tim’d again.

398
00:27:14,855 --> 00:27:15,665
Yeah.

399
00:27:16,150 --> 00:27:17,727
You might as well head out too man.

400
00:27:18,393 --> 00:27:20,708
- You sure? 
- Yeah, don’t worry about it.

401
00:27:20,979 --> 00:27:24,426
You know what? Actually, I have something for ya.

402
00:27:30,866 --> 00:27:31,951
It’s for your new job.

403
00:27:33,963 --> 00:27:37,392
Look, Keith needs some help down at the dealership, he’s a good boss so I figured…

404
00:27:37,901 --> 00:27:39,950
probably pays better than what you’re making now, right?

405
00:27:41,812 --> 00:27:42,934
Thank you man.

406
00:27:44,712 --> 00:27:45,825
- Later. 
- Alright.

407
00:27:47,291 --> 00:27:48,360
Hey Lucas?

408
00:27:50,107 --> 00:27:54,598
Look... I understand if you have to… find out about Dan yourself;

409
00:27:55,207 --> 00:27:57,885
whatever you decide to do, it’s not gonna affect you and me.

410
00:27:59,359 --> 00:28:03,014
He’s come between us before… let’s just not let it happen again.

411
00:28:04,817 --> 00:28:05,724
Thanks man.

412
00:28:19,783 --> 00:28:24,283
Excuse me, Miss Davis. Your credit card’s been declined.

413
00:28:30,079 --> 00:28:31,041
Thank you.

414
00:28:35,314 --> 00:28:36,320
Well then…

415
00:28:37,974 --> 00:28:39,469
looks like we have a problem.

416
00:28:45,204 --> 00:28:47,666
So what’s your policy on IOU’s?

417
00:28:55,973 --> 00:28:59,079
You must be Nathan. I’m Simone. Sorry I’m late.

418
00:28:59,506 --> 00:29:02,663
Oh no, it’s okay but… the party’s actually over.

419
00:29:02,837 --> 00:29:05,653
Oh I don’t think so. Party’s just getting started.

420
00:29:13,417 --> 00:29:14,490
Wild night?

421
00:29:15,745 --> 00:29:17,052
More like a long night.

422
00:29:18,402 --> 00:29:20,394
Hope it’s not too late to give you a show.

423
00:29:21,557 --> 00:29:23,922
Oh thanks but... it’s okay.

424
00:29:24,126 --> 00:29:26,246
You sure? I’m already paid for.

425
00:29:26,682 --> 00:29:30,250
No… I think I’m good.

426
00:29:30,451 --> 00:29:32,067
Or at least you’re trying to be.

427
00:29:34,347 --> 00:29:37,167
It’s fine. I can call a cab to pick me up.

428
00:29:39,349 --> 00:29:45,360
In the meantime, I have an idea about what we can do while we wait.

429
00:29:47,571 --> 00:29:51,065
I can not believe my stupid parents didn’t pay the credit card bill.

430
00:29:51,308 --> 00:29:54,990
We’ve got a hundred and forty in cash, at most. So what’re we gonna do?

431
00:29:55,308 --> 00:29:56,670
I’m gonna take care of it.

432
00:29:57,028 --> 00:29:59,777
- How? 
- Little negotiation.

433
00:29:59,844 --> 00:30:02,010
Brooke, you can not talk your way out of a thousand dollar bill.

434
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:05,183
Don’t be silly. A girl can do anything she puts miles to.

435
00:30:08,584 --> 00:30:14,020
Hi. I was wondering if there might be an… alternate way to settle this ball.

436
00:30:16,516 --> 00:30:18,267
It’s a strip club, honey.

437
00:30:21,504 --> 00:30:23,591
How dirty you willing to get?

438
00:30:29,252 --> 00:30:31,118
How dirty are you willing to get?

439
00:30:31,297 --> 00:30:33,949
Well I hope this is dirty enough for you.

440
00:30:34,019 --> 00:30:37,861
Hey! Here, drink this.

441
00:30:38,213 --> 00:30:39,735
It’ll help you with your hangover tomorrow.

442
00:30:40,558 --> 00:30:41,434
What’s in it?

443
00:30:41,866 --> 00:30:44,501
You don’t wanna know. Drink up!

444
00:30:44,788 --> 00:30:47,322
You sure you guys don’t want me to help you wash the dishes? I totally can.

445
00:30:47,420 --> 00:30:50,409
Absolutely not! The guest of honour is not doing the dishes.

446
00:30:50,487 --> 00:30:53,718
Look, we’re probably gonna be here for a while so you should just take that limo home.

447
00:30:53,978 --> 00:30:56,108
I think Mrs Scott’s had a long night.

448
00:30:57,711 --> 00:30:59,058
Mrs Scott.

449
00:31:00,757 --> 00:31:03,092
You guys probably think I’m crazy for getting married.

450
00:31:03,164 --> 00:31:06,036
No! Alright, maybe a little.

451
00:31:06,266 --> 00:31:08,877
You guys totally have the whole Nick and Jessica thing going on...

452
00:31:08,938 --> 00:31:12,517
just… without… stockaratsi and chickeny-tuna.

453
00:31:13,796 --> 00:31:19,777
Yeah well, I guess I can’t really help it if I found the guy I wanna be with my first time out.

454
00:31:20,254 --> 00:31:22,025
Isn’t that what it’s all about? Maybe if we’re not out there

455
00:31:22,082 --> 00:31:25,036
looking for the one we wanna be with forever then what are we doing?

456
00:31:27,003 --> 00:31:28,262
Having fun?

457
00:31:28,748 --> 00:31:32,220
Oh, love is fun! This kind of love is anyway.

458
00:31:33,771 --> 00:31:37,207
Actually, I’d really like to go home to my husband if you don’t mind.

459
00:31:37,350 --> 00:31:38,968
- Class dismissed. 
- Thank you.

460
00:31:42,695 --> 00:31:45,393
Thank you so much for tonight. Thank you guys.

461
00:31:45,475 --> 00:31:47,222
You won’t be thanking us tomorrow.

462
00:31:47,902 --> 00:31:48,666
Yeah.

463
00:31:49,372 --> 00:31:50,084
Bye!

464
00:31:50,412 --> 00:31:51,154
Bye.

465
00:31:52,506 --> 00:31:55,941
Come on goldilocks. Grime is money.

466
00:32:01,041 --> 00:32:02,910
I thought you’d actually be good at this game.

467
00:32:03,084 --> 00:32:06,575
I was going easy on you before, I’m about to take the safety’s off now though.

468
00:32:06,767 --> 00:32:08,085
Oh, I’m shaking.

469
00:32:10,308 --> 00:32:13,442
Funny, people usually call me before the wedding.

470
00:32:14,952 --> 00:32:17,240
So what’s it like? Being married.

471
00:32:17,743 --> 00:32:20,415
I love it. And Haley, she’s great

472
00:32:21,202 --> 00:32:23,061
and well she’s the one for me.

473
00:32:24,014 --> 00:32:25,723
Even if one’s all you get?

474
00:32:28,387 --> 00:32:31,931
Yeah! Game over for you baby.

475
00:32:37,735 --> 00:32:41,832
Driver! Take me home to my guy.

476
00:32:54,986 --> 00:32:55,775
Hey!

477
00:32:56,521 --> 00:32:59,848
Hey Luke. What’re you doing here so late?

478
00:32:59,943 --> 00:33:01,924
You know, I could ask you that very same thing.

479
00:33:03,526 --> 00:33:04,939
I’m just trying to catch up.

480
00:33:05,328 --> 00:33:08,569
Even though it’s ‘Dan Scott Motors’, I still wanna do well. You know?

481
00:33:08,672 --> 00:33:09,434
Yeah.

482
00:33:10,577 --> 00:33:11,488
So what’s up?

483
00:33:11,801 --> 00:33:16,414
Well… I wanted to thank you for the job offer…

484
00:33:16,726 --> 00:33:18,723
and tell you that I can’t accept it.

485
00:33:20,838 --> 00:33:22,974
Oh… okay.

486
00:33:24,872 --> 00:33:26,863
But I offered the job to Nathan.

487
00:33:27,749 --> 00:33:29,627
I hope… that’s okay with you.

488
00:33:29,727 --> 00:33:31,834
Yeah well, I know he could use the cash.

489
00:33:32,193 --> 00:33:33,387
And the guidance too.

490
00:33:34,078 --> 00:33:35,788
Look Keith, you’ve always helped me out…

491
00:33:37,067 --> 00:33:38,491
well now its Nathan’s turn.

492
00:33:41,210 --> 00:33:42,699
Alright, well I’ll get outta your way.

493
00:33:42,807 --> 00:33:46,202
Oh no, you’re fine. I’m just trying to find those inventory printouts.

494
00:33:52,131 --> 00:33:56,457
How long ago did you call that cab? I think it shoulda been here by now.

495
00:33:56,815 --> 00:33:59,264
Um… I have a confession to make.

496
00:34:00,093 --> 00:34:01,438
I didn’t call a cab.

497
00:34:02,044 --> 00:34:03,563
My car is outside.

498
00:34:04,766 --> 00:34:06,426
You’re really cute, Nathan.

499
00:34:07,641 --> 00:34:08,659
You’re young.

500
00:34:10,169 --> 00:34:11,260
You’re athletic.

501
00:34:12,038 --> 00:34:13,767
You suck at video games.

502
00:34:15,037 --> 00:34:17,689
I was paid a lot of money to show you a good time tonight

503
00:34:17,884 --> 00:34:21,325
and if your idea of a good time is getting your butt kicked by a girl on Playstation,

504
00:34:21,771 --> 00:34:23,032
I’m fine with that

505
00:34:24,203 --> 00:34:27,105
but there’s also a lot of other things I’d be fine with.

506
00:34:31,155 --> 00:34:33,556
There’s a lot of things I’m good at Nathan;

507
00:34:33,988 --> 00:34:36,813
keeping a secret is only one of them.

508
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:39,318
I’ll be in the bedroom.

509
00:34:40,157 --> 00:34:41,667
You decide what you want.

510
00:35:17,611 --> 00:35:18,649
I want you.

511
00:35:21,608 --> 00:35:22,950
God I love you.

512
00:35:30,374 --> 00:35:31,679
How was the stripper?

513
00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:35,386
Pretty good; at NBA Live.

514
00:35:36,646 --> 00:35:40,467
Other than that, I had no interest in her.

515
00:35:41,706 --> 00:35:43,599
I actually had to ask her to leave.

516
00:35:45,827 --> 00:35:46,773
How was the shower?

517
00:35:47,633 --> 00:35:50,557
Um… it was educational.

518
00:35:50,911 --> 00:35:53,174
Oh yeah? What’d you learn?

519
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:55,908
What I already knew.

520
00:35:57,187 --> 00:35:58,822
You are the one that I want.

521
00:36:00,311 --> 00:36:01,407
Yeah, me too.

522
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:05,647
Hey, where you going?

523
00:36:05,856 --> 00:36:08,462
Well, you know how I said tonight was educational?

524
00:36:09,199 --> 00:36:11,235
Honey, you’re gonna love the homework.

525
00:36:17,107 --> 00:36:18,769
I was thinking about what Haley said.

526
00:36:20,356 --> 00:36:22,516
You know how it’s all supposed to be for love.

527
00:36:24,289 --> 00:36:25,491
Kinda scary, huh?

528
00:36:26,382 --> 00:36:27,161
Yeah.

529
00:36:29,045 --> 00:36:30,207
Do you think she’s right?

530
00:36:30,673 --> 00:36:34,523
I know she is. But… that’s not the part that scares me.

531
00:36:36,039 --> 00:36:37,242
So what does?

532
00:36:40,303 --> 00:36:46,304
People are gonna disappoint you; I get that, I kinda expect that but…

533
00:36:46,883 --> 00:36:50,646
I dunno, what if you wake up one day and realise that you’re the disappointment?

534
00:36:58,894 --> 00:36:59,996
What’s on your mind Brooke?

535
00:37:01,409 --> 00:37:03,414
I was just thinking about…

536
00:37:06,283 --> 00:37:08,284
how we’re gonna pay for this limo.

537
00:37:19,395 --> 00:37:22,764
I spoke to the lawyer about the situation with Nathan and Haley.

538
00:37:23,344 --> 00:37:25,933
He says it’s gonna be a lot tougher than he thought.

539
00:37:26,154 --> 00:37:28,888
It doesn’t look like there’s any way to invalidate their marriage.

540
00:37:30,336 --> 00:37:31,843
There’s nothing we can do.

541
00:37:32,445 --> 00:37:33,311
Legally.

542
00:37:36,043 --> 00:37:39,332
What, you look surprised. Why, because it’s something you would say?

543
00:37:39,456 --> 00:37:44,028
No. No, I was just thinking that… maybe we don’t have to take such drastic measures.

544
00:37:44,237 --> 00:37:49,476
Oh, snap out of it Dan! Phoenix Effect or not, I need some help.

545
00:37:49,601 --> 00:37:50,981
They’re teenagers Deb.

546
00:37:51,804 --> 00:37:54,529
Once the newly wed sex wears off, they’ll realise the only thing

547
00:37:54,605 --> 00:37:58,824
keeping this marriage afloat is a minimum wage job pushing bretzels with no benefits.

548
00:37:59,147 --> 00:38:00,867
Then money problems will kick in…

549
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:04,749
and they’ll start to wonder why they rushed into the whole thing.

550
00:38:06,766 --> 00:38:11,421
Their marriage will probably self-destruct and we won’t even have to lift a finger.

551
00:38:11,974 --> 00:38:13,627
And what if it doesn’t?

552
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:17,955
I had a heart attack Deb, not a lobotomy.

553
00:38:23,422 --> 00:38:24,563
Thought you had to be at work.

554
00:38:25,255 --> 00:38:28,516
Oh um… not gonna take the job at the dealership.

555
00:38:29,168 --> 00:38:31,553
I offered it to Nathan, he needs it more

556
00:38:32,090 --> 00:38:34,631
and besides, I’m gonna have my hands full at the café.

557
00:38:34,697 --> 00:38:35,520
The café?

558
00:38:35,803 --> 00:38:39,412
Well, seeing as you’re gonna be so busy with college and classes.

559
00:38:40,307 --> 00:38:43,272
Somebody’s gotta take care of things at the café. Right?

560
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:45,269
Maybe so.

561
00:38:52,131 --> 00:38:52,720
Bye.

562
00:38:54,859 --> 00:38:59,631
Hey, do me a favour; don’t change when you come home from work. Okay?

563
00:39:00,609 --> 00:39:02,540
I’m kinda into the whole mechanic thing.

564
00:39:03,164 --> 00:39:04,423
No problem, ma’am.

565
00:39:16,297 --> 00:39:17,641
What’s going on! 

566
00:39:20,780 --> 00:39:21,741
Come on!

567
00:40:10,454 --> 00:40:11,549
I’ll be inside.

568
00:40:18,204 --> 00:40:22,053
Those pictures in the lockbox… don’t change anything.

569
00:40:23,042 --> 00:40:25,091
Don’t even thing for a second that they do.

570
00:40:27,476 --> 00:40:29,632
I know I can’t change our past Lucas…

571
00:40:31,485 --> 00:40:33,534
but I’m hoping I can change our future.

572
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:05,212
