1
00:00:00,513 --> 00:00:01,985
Previously on One Tree Hill.

2
00:00:02,259 --> 00:00:03,598
He aimed for the wall.

3
00:00:04,422 --> 00:00:06,004
Like he tried to crash.

4
00:00:06,237 --> 00:00:07,038
Hey.

5
00:00:08,241 --> 00:00:09,112
It’s okay.

6
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:10,899
I’m here for you.

7
00:00:11,052 --> 00:00:13,803
Mrs. Scott, how long have you been abusing prescription drugs?

8
00:00:14,013 --> 00:00:15,133
I love you, mom.

9
00:00:16,332 --> 00:00:18,025
Were you able to get a hold of Keith?

10
00:00:19,465 --> 00:00:20,975
Where is he, Whitey?

11
00:00:21,374 --> 00:00:22,286
I love you.

12
00:00:22,726 --> 00:00:23,745
I love you, too.

13
00:00:30,768 --> 00:00:32,531
I’m coming home tomorrow, okay?

14
00:00:33,018 --> 00:00:34,282
Don’t come home, Haley.

15
00:00:34,430 --> 00:00:35,742
Coz I don’t want you to.

16
00:01:21,528 --> 00:01:22,400
Welcome home.

17
00:01:30,848 --> 00:01:34,776
Oh, bill. Bill. Final notice.

18
00:01:35,278 --> 00:01:36,951
Way final notice.

19
00:01:37,642 --> 00:01:39,087
You ever robbed a bank, Luke?

20
00:01:39,179 --> 00:01:40,593
Hey, you got friends. We’ll help.

21
00:01:40,669 --> 00:01:41,883
Yeah, that sounds great.

22
00:01:41,973 --> 00:01:44,253
All I need is the money for these bills and…

23
00:01:44,308 --> 00:01:46,045
a hundred-thousand dollars to pay the hospital.

24
00:01:46,578 --> 00:01:49,679
Wow, woulda been a lot cheaper if you’d just hit the brakes, huh?

25
00:01:52,963 --> 00:01:54,576
What happened out there, Nathan?

26
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:01,374
You were there. Why don’t you tell me?

27
00:02:04,207 --> 00:02:05,578
Look, did you…

28
00:02:06,034 --> 00:02:07,559
you know, feel like…

29
00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:11,762
- I mean, did you wanna-
- Did I wanna, what?

30
00:02:13,135 --> 00:02:14,236
Kill yourself.

31
00:02:15,223 --> 00:02:17,632
Coz, if that’s what happened, you need to see somebody.

32
00:02:17,722 --> 00:02:19,274
I’ll check out Dr. Phil this afternoon.

33
00:02:19,341 --> 00:02:21,352
How long are you gonna dodge talking to me about this?!

34
00:02:21,426 --> 00:02:23,898
How long are you gonna dodge telling me you knew my mom was a pill-head?

35
00:02:26,846 --> 00:02:30,322
Now, look, I screwed up; I hit the wall.

36
00:02:30,779 --> 00:02:33,179
That’s all there was to it. Okay?

37
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,373
Hey, Brooke, what’s going on?

38
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:45,269
Um... total hypothetical here; say you had a friend living in your room

39
00:02:45,314 --> 00:02:49,487
and she was going through your closet looking for her favourite pair of Jimmy Choo’s

40
00:02:49,564 --> 00:02:54,499
but all she found… was this freaky bag of shredded paper that you said was a puzzle?

41
00:02:54,587 --> 00:02:56,906
And, let’s say she got bored.

42
00:02:56,977 --> 00:03:00,274
You know, or… nosey… so…

43
00:03:00,459 --> 00:03:05,225
she kind of put the pieces back together? Would… you be ticked off?

44
00:03:06,649 --> 00:03:11,908
Only if this hypothetical ‘friend’ didn’t bring me the finished product.

45
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:12,726
Well then.

46
00:03:18,446 --> 00:03:19,045
Come here.

47
00:03:27,119 --> 00:03:29,352
Okay, paranoid much?

48
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:32,788
Just enough. So what you got?

49
00:03:33,008 --> 00:03:34,307
It’s a bill of sale.

50
00:03:34,835 --> 00:03:36,914
For… a used car.

51
00:03:37,011 --> 00:03:39,813
Sold to some lady named Christine Gersio?

52
00:03:40,609 --> 00:03:42,050
- Who is she?
- I don’t know.

53
00:03:42,293 --> 00:03:46,285
I think Dan might be running some kind of scam, and this bill could be tied to whatever he’s doing.

54
00:03:46,371 --> 00:03:49,662
Oh, you go detective-boy. In the mean time,

55
00:03:49,755 --> 00:03:52,698
I am off to do a little recon at my favourite clothing store.

56
00:03:54,379 --> 00:03:55,034
Hey, Brooke.

57
00:03:56,642 --> 00:03:57,697
Thank you for this.

58
00:03:58,501 --> 00:03:59,714
You really helped my out.

59
00:04:00,871 --> 00:04:01,726
No problem.

60
00:04:02,094 --> 00:04:04,215
Every Sherlock needs a doctor Watsit, right?

61
00:04:04,339 --> 00:04:05,029
Watson.

62
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:08,403
Bye.

63
00:04:12,892 --> 00:04:13,907
Making a mix?

64
00:04:15,448 --> 00:04:17,326
No, just… sorting CD’s.

65
00:04:17,404 --> 00:04:20,507
Any of those contenders for the next… All Ages night?

66
00:04:20,922 --> 00:04:23,726
I don’t know. I’m not really into hustling bands these days.

67
00:04:26,559 --> 00:04:27,546
Have you seen Jake?

68
00:04:29,722 --> 00:04:30,884
He doesn’t want me to.

69
00:04:32,379 --> 00:04:34,683
I just wish that there was something I could do for him.

70
00:04:34,894 --> 00:04:37,495
Oh, you mean other than riding his lawyers to stay on the case?

71
00:04:37,746 --> 00:04:38,682
It’s not enough.

72
00:04:40,131 --> 00:04:45,435
Well… how about I distract you from something that sucks with something that sucks?

73
00:04:46,219 --> 00:04:47,314
And what’s that?

74
00:04:49,009 --> 00:04:51,661
Nathan’s having some… pretty serious money problems.

75
00:04:51,831 --> 00:04:55,287
So… I was thinking that maybe if… we got everybody together,

76
00:04:55,364 --> 00:04:58,205
we could… figure out a way to raise some cash.

77
00:04:58,590 --> 00:04:59,910
Cool. I’m in.

78
00:04:59,986 --> 00:05:00,781
Yeah?

79
00:05:03,142 --> 00:05:04,789
Oh, by the way, remember…

80
00:05:05,654 --> 00:05:07,017
right before Jake came back…

81
00:05:07,354 --> 00:05:09,853
and you accused me of being a crappy friend?

82
00:05:10,172 --> 00:05:13,546
Yeah… I’m really sorry, I-

83
00:05:13,613 --> 00:05:14,307
No.

84
00:05:15,439 --> 00:05:16,218
You were right.

85
00:05:18,306 --> 00:05:20,427
I don’t ever want that to happen again.

86
00:05:21,516 --> 00:05:24,220
So if you need anything… I’m around, okay?

87
00:05:25,004 --> 00:05:25,776
Okay.

88
00:05:26,386 --> 00:05:27,319
Thank you, Lucas.

89
00:05:28,815 --> 00:05:29,463
Alright.

90
00:05:42,638 --> 00:05:43,758
We could have a car wash.

91
00:05:44,921 --> 00:05:47,229
Nathan and cars, not a good combo.

92
00:05:48,085 --> 00:05:48,904
Bake sale?

93
00:05:49,314 --> 00:05:53,645
Speaking for the girls, bikini season is right around the corner, so no.

94
00:05:53,808 --> 00:05:56,409
What about TRIC? Peyton could hook up a benefit or something, right?

95
00:05:56,579 --> 00:05:59,378
Uh… well that’s where Haley met Chris so…

96
00:05:59,462 --> 00:06:01,278
I doubt Nathan’s gonna wanna go anywhere near there.

97
00:06:01,377 --> 00:06:03,327
But I bet he’d be down with a brothel.

98
00:06:06,077 --> 00:06:09,154
What? It worked for Tom Cruise in ‘Risky Business’.

99
00:06:09,216 --> 00:06:09,927
That’s it.

100
00:06:10,024 --> 00:06:12,384
Peyton, don’t encourage Dim!

101
00:06:12,466 --> 00:06:17,268
No, we throw a movie night, okay? And we can… take donations and sell concessions-

102
00:06:17,342 --> 00:06:20,480
Yeah, no, we can do it at the Rivercourt. You know, we could bring a big screen.

103
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:23,910
And rig the AV closet for films and a projector.

104
00:06:23,987 --> 00:06:26,735
You mean the same closet I caught you making out with Erica last week?

105
00:06:29,328 --> 00:06:31,708
It’s good to be an AV geek with keys.

106
00:06:32,434 --> 00:06:35,563
But, I’m flying solo this weekend; Erica’s visiting her grandmother.

107
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:36,454
What if it rains?

108
00:06:36,541 --> 00:06:37,560
I’m already on it.

109
00:06:38,886 --> 00:06:42,874
Oh… no, we need a plan B, it’s gonna pour all weekend.

110
00:06:45,848 --> 00:06:47,098
We could do it at TRIC.

111
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:49,249
If you convince Nathan to go.

112
00:06:51,598 --> 00:06:53,901
I’m gonna pay the hospital bill; it’s just that… right now

113
00:06:53,968 --> 00:06:57,348
I’m… completely tapped out and I can’t go back to work yet.

114
00:06:57,474 --> 00:06:58,747
Let me pull up your file.

115
00:07:03,555 --> 00:07:05,383
Uh, Nathan, your bill’s paid.

116
00:07:05,638 --> 00:07:07,066
The insurance must have covered it.

117
00:07:07,154 --> 00:07:08,285
What kind of plan do you have?

118
00:07:10,138 --> 00:07:14,046
I don’t know. My… my wife usually pays attention to that stuff.

119
00:07:14,137 --> 00:07:15,463
Well, apparently, you’re all set.

120
00:07:16,027 --> 00:07:18,928
She sounds like a keeper. Don’t let her get away.

121
00:07:19,007 --> 00:07:20,926
Yeah… thanks.

122
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:30,327
Nathan, why didn’t you tell me they were releasing you today?

123
00:07:30,399 --> 00:07:31,602
Coz it’s none of your business.

124
00:07:35,932 --> 00:07:37,393
Why don’t you move home, son?

125
00:07:37,637 --> 00:07:38,948
At least until you’re back on your feet.

126
00:07:39,015 --> 00:07:42,103
Forget it, alright!? I don’t want your help, I just wanna move on with my life.

127
00:07:44,011 --> 00:07:45,425
In that case, I can help.

128
00:07:49,118 --> 00:07:50,607
What is this, divorce papers?!

129
00:07:50,716 --> 00:07:51,576
Annulment.

130
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:55,379
Any judge who sees how young you are will say you weren’t in your right mind when you married.

131
00:07:55,462 --> 00:07:56,506
Oh, so now I’m crazy?

132
00:07:56,583 --> 00:07:58,077
You are if you don’t sign those papers.

133
00:07:58,707 --> 00:08:00,259
Why drag Haley down with you?

134
00:08:01,022 --> 00:08:03,750
As long as you’re married to her, she’s also responsible for you debt.

135
00:08:03,843 --> 00:08:06,674
You don’t give a rat’s ass about Haley. This is what you want.

136
00:08:06,746 --> 00:08:08,338
It’s also what’s best for you.

137
00:08:09,648 --> 00:08:12,152
She made her choice and it wasn’t you. Why hang on?

138
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:14,104
Get out.

139
00:08:14,318 --> 00:08:15,450
You have a chance, right now-

140
00:08:15,516 --> 00:08:17,891
I hit you once, dad, alright? I don’t have a problem doing it again.

141
00:08:17,953 --> 00:08:20,068
Listen, you wanna wallow in self-pity, fine.

142
00:08:21,186 --> 00:08:23,586
But she’s ready to move on, I think you know that.

143
00:08:28,747 --> 00:08:29,673
Just in case.

144
00:08:45,715 --> 00:08:50,077
So… the bill of sale you pieced together was for twelve thousand.

145
00:08:50,379 --> 00:08:54,122
But the one on file at the dealership… said the woman paid nine.

146
00:08:55,330 --> 00:08:56,452
A counting mistake?

147
00:08:56,533 --> 00:08:58,519
Well, that’s what I thought, too. So I called her…

148
00:08:58,814 --> 00:09:02,038
she said she paid twelve, in cash.

149
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:06,626
So, Dan destroyed the bill with the higher price and pocketed three grand.

150
00:09:06,733 --> 00:09:07,689
Seems that way.

151
00:09:08,939 --> 00:09:13,113
Alright, I’m not math wiz, but it doesn’t seem like such a major scam.

152
00:09:13,835 --> 00:09:15,601
Depends on how many times he’s done it.

153
00:09:17,679 --> 00:09:19,466
So that’s why you’re still staying at the house?

154
00:09:19,564 --> 00:09:20,802
Trying to figure out what he’s doing?

155
00:09:21,033 --> 00:09:23,086
I need all the access to him I can get.

156
00:09:23,537 --> 00:09:25,134
Why didn’t you tell me about this sooner?

157
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:29,383
I… didn’t know how you’d feel about me trying to take down Dan.

158
00:09:32,491 --> 00:09:33,726
It’s fine by me.

159
00:09:39,235 --> 00:09:41,964
Listen… about your mom…

160
00:09:42,174 --> 00:09:45,067
I did see her take some pills. Once.

161
00:09:46,131 --> 00:09:49,828
Okay? I confronted her… and she told me to mind my own damn business.

162
00:09:50,115 --> 00:09:51,599
I’m sorry, I should have mentioned it.

163
00:09:51,692 --> 00:09:52,722
Nah, it’s okay.

164
00:09:53,361 --> 00:09:55,360
My dad and I should have noticed it anyway.

165
00:09:55,502 --> 00:10:00,693
Ah, don’t worry about it. You know… she’ll get through it. Deb’s tough.

166
00:10:00,764 --> 00:10:02,700
She has to be; look who she married.

167
00:10:03,833 --> 00:10:04,758
So, we good?

168
00:10:06,541 --> 00:10:08,671
Just make sure you keep me posted on my dad.

169
00:10:08,829 --> 00:10:10,798
I need all the entertainment I can get these days.

170
00:10:11,885 --> 00:10:16,551
By the way… my insurance paid for my entire hospital stay.

171
00:10:16,632 --> 00:10:18,936
So… I don’t even really need a fundraiser anymore.

172
00:10:19,837 --> 00:10:23,754
You know, you still got… bills. Rent.

173
00:10:23,836 --> 00:10:25,013
Yeah, I’ll figure something out.

174
00:10:25,090 --> 00:10:26,821
Come on! It’ll be fun.

175
00:10:27,088 --> 00:10:29,508
Besides, everyone really wants to help out.

176
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:33,375
Rig up the dart board with Chris’ face on it and I’m in.

177
00:10:35,704 --> 00:10:38,355
I love this…

178
00:10:39,463 --> 00:10:42,524
And I have got to have… this!

179
00:10:42,692 --> 00:10:43,860
And I need this.

180
00:10:44,787 --> 00:10:48,693
Oh… look at these adorable wedges.

181
00:10:48,776 --> 00:10:53,097
Brooke, pace yourself. You gotta shoot for gradual ramp up to your full shopping speed.

182
00:10:55,545 --> 00:10:57,341
Just don’t let me lose track of time, okay?

183
00:10:57,422 --> 00:11:00,632
I promised Lucas I would help him cook dinner for Nathan, although,

184
00:11:00,761 --> 00:11:03,977
when I say cook, I actually mean order pizza.

185
00:11:04,386 --> 00:11:07,873
Seems like you and Lucas have been spending a lotta time together lately, huh?

186
00:11:08,533 --> 00:11:12,680
Yeah. I think this whole ‘friends’ thing is actually working out.

187
00:11:14,134 --> 00:11:16,885
And he’s been taking such great care of Nathan.

188
00:11:18,170 --> 00:11:22,132
Okay. Enough with the ‘um-hm’s’ already.

189
00:11:22,450 --> 00:11:27,621
Fine. But, if I didn’t know any better, I’d say you were vibing on him again.

190
00:11:27,795 --> 00:11:29,674
Seriously, we are just friends.

191
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:35,917
Okay, all I’m saying is on the off chance that… you wanted more…

192
00:11:37,283 --> 00:11:38,546
I think it would be great.

193
00:11:38,681 --> 00:11:39,310
Really?

194
00:11:40,083 --> 00:11:45,321
You’re not afraid the three of us will get… sucked back down into the Bermuda Triangle of drama?

195
00:11:45,392 --> 00:11:47,266
No. Not this time.

196
00:11:47,517 --> 00:11:49,197
But we said ‘Hoes over Bros’.

197
00:11:49,268 --> 00:11:51,148
Well that doesn’t mean no ‘Bros’ ever.

198
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:54,071
The thing I’ve learned from all this Jake craziness is we’ve gotta grab

199
00:11:54,128 --> 00:11:55,924
every second you have with the people you love.

200
00:11:57,809 --> 00:11:59,652
Just don’t forget about your ‘Hoes’.

201
00:12:01,239 --> 00:12:01,981
Come here.

202
00:12:02,289 --> 00:12:05,089
You are the best friend ever, P. Sawyer, but…

203
00:12:05,197 --> 00:12:08,428
honestly, if Lucas and I couldn’t make it as a couple before…

204
00:12:09,256 --> 00:12:10,814
what makes you think we can now?

205
00:12:11,167 --> 00:12:13,415
Well, for one thing, I wouldn’t make out with him this time.

206
00:12:15,055 --> 00:12:19,681
And another, he’s not the same guy, and you are definitely not the same girl.

207
00:12:34,009 --> 00:12:36,505
Looks good fellas. Let’s just keep an eye on the clock.

208
00:12:37,843 --> 00:12:39,973
Hey, do you have a second?

209
00:12:40,044 --> 00:12:43,064
Yeah, yeah, sure, listen, listen. You know I love you, right?

210
00:12:43,229 --> 00:12:45,757
But you have got to lose that fluffy top you wore last night.

211
00:12:45,845 --> 00:12:48,942
I mean, come on this is rock n’ roll princess. This is not the senior prom.

212
00:12:49,025 --> 00:12:53,653
Listen… I need some time off. There’s some things going on with my husband-

213
00:12:53,719 --> 00:12:54,454
Again?

214
00:12:56,028 --> 00:12:57,549
Haley, look, I like you…

215
00:12:57,856 --> 00:13:00,499
I mean you’ve been a major pain in my ass, but in a good way.

216
00:13:00,566 --> 00:13:02,935
So, I mean, if you gotta go, I can’t stop you. But…

217
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:04,866
I may need to replace you.

218
00:13:05,373 --> 00:13:06,314
Are you serious?

219
00:13:06,402 --> 00:13:07,646
The question is ‘are you’?

220
00:13:08,614 --> 00:13:11,894
Come on, I mean, you got talent. I mean, you could be more than just a duet girl.

221
00:13:11,977 --> 00:13:12,909
I know but I’ve-

222
00:13:12,970 --> 00:13:15,828
Look, this is a business, Haley, and I will work like hell to make you a star,

223
00:13:15,905 --> 00:13:19,151
but you gotta make a decision; how bad do you want the big time?!

224
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:25,186
Jimmy, move that. Let’s go guys, come on, you’re on my clock, not yours.

225
00:13:33,288 --> 00:13:34,018
What d’ya think?

226
00:13:35,127 --> 00:13:35,965
It’s pretty clear;

227
00:13:37,292 --> 00:13:40,726
any cash transaction over ten thousand dollars gets reported to the government.

228
00:13:41,612 --> 00:13:45,288
Dan changes the transaction amount from, like, twelve thousand to nine thousand…

229
00:13:45,663 --> 00:13:48,943
Which allows him to keep skimming profits and pocketing the extra cash.

230
00:13:49,011 --> 00:13:49,939
Exactly.

231
00:13:50,670 --> 00:13:53,250
If that cash you found in the ceiling at the dealership is any indication,

232
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:54,940
he’s shredding a lot of invoices.

233
00:13:56,363 --> 00:13:59,732
Well then I need to pull all the files for cash sums just under ten grand.

234
00:13:59,798 --> 00:14:01,284
No, no, no, no, no, you’ve done enough.

235
00:14:02,031 --> 00:14:04,682
Andy, I’m so close.

236
00:14:04,754 --> 00:14:06,900
Yeah, and we’ll get him, Lucas, I promise.

237
00:14:07,668 --> 00:14:09,348
Just let me find where he’s hiding this money.

238
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:11,763
We’ll have everything we need.

239
00:14:26,298 --> 00:14:30,991
Yo, dude, check out this awesome footage I swiped from my mom’s garden club.

240
00:14:32,005 --> 00:14:33,043
Here.

241
00:14:35,736 --> 00:14:36,606
What’s wrong with you?

242
00:14:38,854 --> 00:14:41,301
Nothing, nothing… I just…

243
00:14:41,885 --> 00:14:44,343
you were in this… weird dream I had during surgery.

244
00:14:44,727 --> 00:14:46,642
Yeah? And?

245
00:14:46,786 --> 00:14:49,263
And, we were…

246
00:14:49,422 --> 00:14:52,332
kind of… showering together.

247
00:14:55,595 --> 00:14:58,428
Don’t be embarrassed, everybody has that dream about me.

248
00:15:01,455 --> 00:15:03,585
Don’t have the dream now, Tim!

249
00:15:16,364 --> 00:15:17,378
Nice air-ball.

250
00:15:18,969 --> 00:15:20,543
You haven’t learned anything, have you?

251
00:15:20,634 --> 00:15:21,618
What’re you talking about?

252
00:15:22,504 --> 00:15:27,439
Freshmen year: you rolled your ankle and your doc said ‘no basketball for a month’,

253
00:15:27,757 --> 00:15:29,405
and you didn’t listen.

254
00:15:36,092 --> 00:15:37,473
Do you believe in dreams, Peyton?

255
00:15:37,689 --> 00:15:41,227
What d’ya mean, like… do I think there’s some kinda message?

256
00:15:42,599 --> 00:15:43,824
More like warnings.

257
00:15:45,262 --> 00:15:49,373
About… how every choice you make… shapes your future.

258
00:15:51,339 --> 00:15:53,628
Like, if I hadn’t turned down High Flyers,

259
00:15:53,705 --> 00:15:55,369
or if I hadn’t gone after Haley…

260
00:15:55,789 --> 00:15:57,735
or if my dad hadn’t married my mom.

261
00:15:59,599 --> 00:16:00,622
I know what you mean.

262
00:16:02,425 --> 00:16:06,372
If my mom had left five minutes earlier to pick me up, she’d still be alive.

263
00:16:14,261 --> 00:16:16,775
Was your accident and accident, Nathan?

264
00:16:24,476 --> 00:16:26,694
I don’t know if I aimed for that wall, Peyton.

265
00:16:29,864 --> 00:16:32,582
Maybe I was thinking about Haley right before the crash;

266
00:16:34,301 --> 00:16:35,864
about how we got off-track.

267
00:16:36,452 --> 00:16:37,732
I mean, I feel different now.

268
00:16:38,637 --> 00:16:39,668
I know what’s important;

269
00:16:40,569 --> 00:16:43,519
my mom, my friends… basketball.

270
00:16:43,646 --> 00:16:44,755
And Haley?

271
00:16:46,835 --> 00:16:50,465
Lately, I’ve been wondering if… all the energy we used trying to hold our marriage together

272
00:16:50,532 --> 00:16:52,283
could have been better spent on other things.

273
00:16:54,214 --> 00:16:54,752
Nathan-

274
00:16:54,808 --> 00:16:55,922
How’re you and Jake doing?

275
00:16:58,069 --> 00:17:01,782
He… is really not up to seeing me these days.

276
00:17:02,968 --> 00:17:03,814
I’m sorry.

277
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:07,613
He’ll change his mind.

278
00:17:08,468 --> 00:17:11,694
What about you and this place? I mean, you bringing any new bands in?

279
00:17:11,826 --> 00:17:13,967
Actually, I was thinking I was gonna drop that.

280
00:17:14,227 --> 00:17:16,470
You know, it’s just caused so many problems.

281
00:17:16,542 --> 00:17:18,579
What happened with Haley and Chris is not your fault.

282
00:17:19,086 --> 00:17:22,492
You love music, Peyton, don’t back away from your dreams.

283
00:17:25,569 --> 00:17:28,773
You’re gonna end up so bitter you’ll just destroy all the people around you.

284
00:17:47,341 --> 00:17:48,946
- What’s up, Luke? 
- What’s up, Junk.

285
00:17:50,715 --> 00:17:55,345
I’ll take some pretzels, soda… got any Crackerjack?

286
00:17:58,096 --> 00:17:59,847
Don’t… say Crackerjack.

287
00:18:00,774 --> 00:18:01,429
Alright.

288
00:18:09,417 --> 00:18:10,343
Hey, Peyton.

289
00:18:15,628 --> 00:18:18,321
Hey everybody, you guys ready for some movies?!

290
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:25,836
Okay…

291
00:18:26,553 --> 00:18:31,146
well then grab some snacks, stretch out and we’re gonna kicks things off with a couple of cartoons.

292
00:18:40,445 --> 00:18:45,348
The number one killer… of young people is traffic accidents.

293
00:18:45,933 --> 00:18:48,042
And that’s… that’s gotta be…

294
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:51,406
one of the biggest and grossest waste of human life.

295
00:18:51,585 --> 00:18:56,183
About… forty percent of fatal and injury accidents involve

296
00:18:56,245 --> 00:18:59,799
people in the age group of fifteen to twenty-four.

297
00:19:05,671 --> 00:19:07,597
Mouth, we can’t show this to Nathan.

298
00:19:07,659 --> 00:19:10,571
I know, I know. The film cans are all mislabelled.

299
00:19:13,036 --> 00:19:15,844
Ah, Nate, I’m sorry, man. This isn’t what we planned.

300
00:19:15,913 --> 00:19:17,508
What, are you kidding me, this is awesome.

301
00:19:18,779 --> 00:19:20,526
Come on! Turn it up!

302
00:19:36,723 --> 00:19:39,428
You spent thirty bucks on pay-per-view porn?

303
00:19:40,990 --> 00:19:41,711
That’s mine.

304
00:19:43,929 --> 00:19:44,743
What?

305
00:19:45,095 --> 00:19:47,004
You were out of town. I was lonely.

306
00:19:50,006 --> 00:19:52,823
Um… I got you cookies and liquorish.

307
00:19:53,104 --> 00:19:56,145
Hey, I got you another soda and… some popcorn.

308
00:19:56,268 --> 00:19:59,093
Uh… want me to scrounge up a pillow so you can elevate that knee?

309
00:19:59,187 --> 00:20:00,134
No, no, I’m good.

310
00:20:00,851 --> 00:20:01,597
Alright.

311
00:20:02,746 --> 00:20:06,564
Okay, well, send up a flare if you need anything else, guys.

312
00:20:11,193 --> 00:20:13,835
Brooke’s been really great since Jake’s been gone.

313
00:20:13,963 --> 00:20:17,475
Yeah… Luke’s really had my back since the accident.

314
00:20:19,605 --> 00:20:21,243
She’s driving me crazy.

315
00:20:23,067 --> 00:20:26,250
I hear ya. Luke’s this close to tucking me in and singing me a lullaby.

316
00:20:27,331 --> 00:20:29,579
- If you want, I could-
- Tim, stop it.

317
00:20:32,128 --> 00:20:34,386
Looks like you got a letter mixed in with your bills.

318
00:20:38,846 --> 00:20:39,906
It’s from my mom.

319
00:20:56,282 --> 00:20:57,494
Thanks, Brooke.

320
00:21:00,269 --> 00:21:01,386
For what?

321
00:21:03,565 --> 00:21:05,118
For letting me vent about Dan.

322
00:21:06,623 --> 00:21:09,649
For helping… Nathan out so much.

323
00:21:12,179 --> 00:21:13,959
I just don’t know what I’d do without you.

324
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:16,525
You look like you needed some chocolate.

325
00:23:19,618 --> 00:23:21,128
Don’t give up on him, Peyton.

326
00:23:23,304 --> 00:23:24,621
Jake’ll let you back in.

327
00:23:57,792 --> 00:23:58,458
Come in.

328
00:24:00,393 --> 00:24:03,999
Hey. Tim told me he drove you home. You okay?

329
00:24:04,075 --> 00:24:07,637
Yeah, yeah, I just… I was reading that letter from my mom

330
00:24:07,695 --> 00:24:10,643
and I didn’t… really feel like being in a big crowd anymore.

331
00:24:11,504 --> 00:24:12,548
How’s she doing?

332
00:24:14,330 --> 00:24:16,563
Rehab sounds tough but she’s hanging in there.

333
00:24:19,094 --> 00:24:22,133
Part of her therapy is to make amends; so she…

334
00:24:22,676 --> 00:24:26,506
she apologised for all the times she used work or pills to avoid problems at home.

335
00:24:26,858 --> 00:24:28,763
I’m sure that was hard for her to say.

336
00:24:28,855 --> 00:24:29,598
Yeah.

337
00:24:32,091 --> 00:24:34,164
She’s hoping all three of us can be together again.

338
00:24:34,933 --> 00:24:38,815
I mean, she seems to think that if she can change… maybe we all can. I…

339
00:24:41,217 --> 00:24:42,880
I don’t know if I can do it, Peyton.

340
00:24:47,157 --> 00:24:50,605
I’ve been trying to believe the best in people, lately, you know?

341
00:24:51,224 --> 00:24:53,313
Like, hoping Nikki will just back off…

342
00:24:54,001 --> 00:24:56,739
or that Jake’s lawyers will find a way to get him out…

343
00:24:57,636 --> 00:25:01,174
so I’d like to believe that… even somebody as assy as your dad

344
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:03,129
could be different if he really wanted to.

345
00:25:03,237 --> 00:25:04,152
Yeah, but…

346
00:25:05,418 --> 00:25:07,644
you know all the crap that he’s pulled in the past.

347
00:25:07,702 --> 00:25:10,399
I mean, doesn’t it sound crazy to try to be a family again?

348
00:25:10,895 --> 00:25:14,122
Um… I’m probably not the right person to ask.

349
00:25:14,199 --> 00:25:16,119
Well, I mean, I wanna know what you think.

350
00:25:17,685 --> 00:25:18,552
Tell me.

351
00:25:22,959 --> 00:25:26,389
I would give anything to have one more day with my mom and dad together.

352
00:25:30,781 --> 00:25:34,054
Yeah… I’m really sorry Peyton. I wasn’t even thinking-

353
00:25:34,156 --> 00:25:36,604
It’s okay. Really, it’s…

354
00:25:38,637 --> 00:25:41,677
Truth is… you have bigger things to worry about.

355
00:25:43,434 --> 00:25:47,718
I opened this letter from your insurance company and your premium hasn’t been paid.

356
00:25:47,827 --> 00:25:50,838
So… you don’t have any coverage.

357
00:25:51,482 --> 00:25:55,774
That’s not possible. I mean I just talked to the… lady at the hospital and she said Haley paid this.

358
00:25:55,851 --> 00:26:00,495
Oh! Okay, well… maybe it was a mistake.

359
00:26:04,683 --> 00:26:06,594
Unless it wasn’t insurance who paid.

360
00:26:15,522 --> 00:26:18,165
Nathan, what’re you doing here? You’re not supposed to drive.

361
00:26:18,252 --> 00:26:20,843
My insurance got cancelled; it didn’t cover my accident.

362
00:26:21,135 --> 00:26:24,300
So I called the hospital and I found out that you paid my bill;

363
00:26:24,370 --> 00:26:25,993
and then I called my landlord…

364
00:26:26,202 --> 00:26:27,856
and I found out you paid my rent, too.

365
00:26:27,956 --> 00:26:29,893
Well of course I did; you’re my son, you needed my help.

366
00:26:29,992 --> 00:26:32,665
Help from you always comes with strings attached, dad!

367
00:26:32,736 --> 00:26:36,842
So what’re you looking for this time, huh? Gratitude? Respect? Love?

368
00:26:38,198 --> 00:26:39,111
Forget it.

369
00:26:39,944 --> 00:26:42,765
You think I paid your bills as a ploy to get you to love me?

370
00:26:42,889 --> 00:26:46,018
I know I’ve ruined any chance for that; with you and you mother.

371
00:26:46,877 --> 00:26:49,828
But don’t make my mistake; don’t push her away.

372
00:26:50,789 --> 00:26:52,091
You save it, alright, dad?

373
00:26:52,184 --> 00:26:53,150
Listen to me!

374
00:26:53,923 --> 00:26:56,396
It’s my fault you emancipated yourself, I know that.

375
00:26:56,509 --> 00:26:58,238
It’s my fault your mother’s in rehab!

376
00:26:59,759 --> 00:27:02,954
Somewhere along the line, I started hurting the people closest to me.

377
00:27:04,076 --> 00:27:05,924
And I haven’t figured out how to stop.

378
00:27:06,002 --> 00:27:08,842
You wanna stop being a dick, dad? Then just do it.

379
00:27:11,069 --> 00:27:12,287
I want to.

380
00:27:18,442 --> 00:27:20,992
I figured if Lucas moved in, I’d be my best self.

381
00:27:24,361 --> 00:27:25,591
The funny thing is…

382
00:27:26,844 --> 00:27:28,633
he’s a better man than I’ll ever be.

383
00:27:28,912 --> 00:27:31,472
All these years I’ve been the bad guy for abandoning him.

384
00:27:33,624 --> 00:27:35,727
Seems I actually did him and Karen a favour.

385
00:27:55,077 --> 00:27:56,173
Nice try, dad.

386
00:27:58,001 --> 00:27:59,024
What else you got?

387
00:27:59,373 --> 00:28:00,709
This is how far we’ve come?

388
00:28:01,958 --> 00:28:03,360
You don’t believe when I’m sincere.

389
00:28:03,448 --> 00:28:05,025
History’s on my side, dad.

390
00:28:05,368 --> 00:28:07,394
No matter what you think, I would do anything for you.

391
00:28:07,544 --> 00:28:09,085
That’s what family does for each other.

392
00:28:09,208 --> 00:28:10,626
Even if you wife doesn’t understand that.

393
00:28:10,703 --> 00:28:11,839
Leave Haley out of this.

394
00:28:11,912 --> 00:28:13,898
You almost died; she didn’t even come to the hospital!

395
00:28:13,975 --> 00:28:14,902
I told her not to!

396
00:28:14,978 --> 00:28:17,001
And you were right. Don’t you see?

397
00:28:17,801 --> 00:28:22,105
This is a chance, a clean break for you and her to be the people you were meant to be.

398
00:28:22,187 --> 00:28:23,458
This conversation is over.

399
00:28:23,554 --> 00:28:26,745
No, right here, right now! This is your future, it starts right here!

400
00:28:27,457 --> 00:28:30,937
Hey, you wanna hate me, fine! I can live with that.

401
00:28:31,203 --> 00:28:32,724
But don’t you become me.

402
00:28:32,873 --> 00:28:34,450
That will never happen.

403
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:36,933
Yes it will.

404
00:28:37,876 --> 00:28:39,478
If you make the wrong choice…

405
00:28:39,565 --> 00:28:41,747
you’ll spend the rest of your life wishing you were a different man.

406
00:28:57,334 --> 00:29:01,919
Dear Keith, I don’t know if you’re looking at e-mail, but I need to say something.

407
00:29:02,333 --> 00:29:06,343
It’s hard for me not to march in and take charge when the people I love are hurting.

408
00:29:06,941 --> 00:29:08,057
But I get it now…

409
00:29:08,657 --> 00:29:09,952
that’s not what you need.

410
00:29:10,387 --> 00:29:13,817
If you have to go through this alone, I’ll respect that…

411
00:29:14,079 --> 00:29:15,923
even if it’s not what I want.

412
00:29:16,727 --> 00:29:20,513
I won’t call or write again. Just know that I’m here for you.

413
00:29:21,216 --> 00:29:23,926
Now and always. Karen.

414
00:29:44,859 --> 00:29:45,678
Hey.

415
00:29:47,656 --> 00:29:49,218
Hey, thanks for coming.

416
00:29:49,652 --> 00:29:51,439
Uh, I got some extra garbage bags.

417
00:29:51,588 --> 00:29:52,632
You’re kidding, right?

418
00:29:53,845 --> 00:29:54,747
Yeah.

419
00:29:57,179 --> 00:30:01,019
You know, we did really well for Nathan last night.

420
00:30:01,484 --> 00:30:06,896
Particularly since you… snuck in your allowance cheque from your folks.

421
00:30:06,958 --> 00:30:09,826
Oh, don’t think of it as an allowance; think of it as…

422
00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:13,877
three skirts, four tops, two bags and…

423
00:30:14,670 --> 00:30:17,331
a lot of… really hot lingerie.

424
00:30:17,589 --> 00:30:18,944
I thought that’d be tough for you.

425
00:30:19,312 --> 00:30:21,980
Just seemed like it was time to spread the karmic well.

426
00:30:23,071 --> 00:30:24,781
That’s gonna mean a lot to Nathan.

427
00:30:25,406 --> 00:30:27,285
I’m just sorry you had to give everything back.

428
00:30:27,454 --> 00:30:29,511
Well… not everything.

429
00:30:29,701 --> 00:30:32,748
Do you think I’m terrible for keeping these really cute wedges?

430
00:30:35,037 --> 00:30:35,789
No.

431
00:30:38,939 --> 00:30:43,250
Listen… we’ve been so caught up with Peyton and Nathan that I,

432
00:30:43,346 --> 00:30:46,889
that I feel like I haven’t… really checked in with you.

433
00:30:49,132 --> 00:30:51,483
How’re you doing… without Felix around?

434
00:30:51,738 --> 00:30:56,219
Oh, fine. He was not the guy for me.

435
00:30:57,887 --> 00:31:00,083
Well, I’m sure the guy is out there somewhere.

436
00:31:00,181 --> 00:31:01,041
Maybe.

437
00:31:02,884 --> 00:31:05,128
But I’m scared to open up my heart like that, again.

438
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:08,178
Isn’t the alternative… even scarier?

439
00:31:08,271 --> 00:31:10,119
Sure, I get lonely sometimes.

440
00:31:10,990 --> 00:31:11,978
That’s hard.

441
00:31:13,038 --> 00:31:16,888
But… I guess that’s the price you pay for figuring out what you really want, right?

442
00:31:19,811 --> 00:31:20,621
Yeah.

443
00:31:21,301 --> 00:31:22,975
No, that’s perfect. That’s great.

444
00:31:23,473 --> 00:31:24,973
We won’t let you down, take care.

445
00:31:25,367 --> 00:31:28,541
Great news: Gavin’s manager is excited about you as a solo act.

446
00:31:29,003 --> 00:31:30,271
We should record a demo.

447
00:31:31,797 --> 00:31:35,141
I’m sorry… tonight’s my last show.

448
00:31:36,478 --> 00:31:38,182
No, no, Haley, no, no, you gotta think about this.

449
00:31:38,238 --> 00:31:41,055
I have thought about this. I’m going home to my husband.

450
00:31:41,126 --> 00:31:42,442
What if you’re making a mistake?

451
00:31:42,530 --> 00:31:45,918
Well… the mistake was leaving him in the first place.

452
00:31:47,930 --> 00:31:48,832
No, Haley.

453
00:31:48,919 --> 00:31:49,758
I’m sorry!

454
00:31:49,972 --> 00:31:50,649
Haley.

455
00:31:53,912 --> 00:31:54,934
Hey, mom.

456
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:59,241
Yeah, yeah, it’s good to hear your voice, too.

457
00:32:00,966 --> 00:32:03,163
Mom, please don’t cry.

458
00:32:04,197 --> 00:32:06,056
Things are gonna be okay, alright?

459
00:32:08,381 --> 00:32:10,956
No… I’m the one who’s sorry.

460
00:32:12,123 --> 00:32:13,797
Listen, I shut you out…

461
00:32:15,067 --> 00:32:16,798
I was so sure that I was right…

462
00:32:17,391 --> 00:32:21,672
only you couldn’t see it or you didn’t care to see it.

463
00:32:24,098 --> 00:32:25,660
I was wrong to do that.

464
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:30,401
I understand, now, that you had dreams too and things weren’t easy for you.

465
00:32:33,184 --> 00:32:35,486
I know how I didn’t make them easy.

466
00:32:38,967 --> 00:32:41,270
I love you, mom, for pulling it together.

467
00:32:42,981 --> 00:32:44,496
I just wanted to tell you that…

468
00:32:47,723 --> 00:32:49,571
things are gonna be different when you get home.

469
00:32:50,673 --> 00:32:51,717
I promise.

470
00:32:53,227 --> 00:32:55,321
I’m gonna make sure you get the life you want.

471
00:32:58,307 --> 00:32:59,575
Thank you, goodnight.

472
00:33:03,347 --> 00:33:04,209
Thank you.

473
00:33:04,471 --> 00:33:05,263
See ya later.

474
00:33:07,287 --> 00:33:08,166
Hey, Haley?

475
00:33:08,361 --> 00:33:10,702
There’s a tall, dark, hottie waiting in the Green Room.

476
00:33:10,788 --> 00:33:12,043
Say’s he’s your biggest fan.

477
00:33:12,171 --> 00:33:12,964
Thank you.

478
00:33:16,184 --> 00:33:17,270
Caught the show.

479
00:33:18,525 --> 00:33:20,404
Who knew you actually had talent?

480
00:33:23,005 --> 00:33:24,689
What’re you doing here, Mr. Scott?

481
00:33:24,787 --> 00:33:26,615
I wanted to see what all the fuss was about.

482
00:33:27,562 --> 00:33:29,703
And since you’re clearly gonna be a big star…

483
00:33:33,333 --> 00:33:35,102
I want your autograph.

484
00:33:36,660 --> 00:33:38,278
Petition for annulment?

485
00:33:38,703 --> 00:33:40,505
It’ll be like the marriage never happened.

486
00:33:41,088 --> 00:33:43,420
My marriage is none of your business.

487
00:33:43,537 --> 00:33:46,122
And when Nathan finds out that you went behind his back to get this-

488
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:49,420
I’m not hiding anything from him.

489
00:33:50,627 --> 00:33:51,846
It’s over, Haley.

490
00:33:53,296 --> 00:33:55,242
Why else would Nathan have asked me to come?

491
00:34:04,886 --> 00:34:05,608
Hey.

492
00:34:06,396 --> 00:34:10,144
Good news: Brooke came through with the phone, the rent, you name it!

493
00:34:10,263 --> 00:34:13,687
And Andy says as soon as finds out where Dan’s stashing the skimmed money,

494
00:34:13,990 --> 00:34:15,059
we can nail him.

495
00:34:16,924 --> 00:34:17,865
What’re you doing?

496
00:34:19,090 --> 00:34:20,278
I’m moving back home.

497
00:34:20,452 --> 00:34:22,034
And what is that, Dan’s bright idea?

498
00:34:22,312 --> 00:34:25,495
He’s right. Haley and I have been kidding ourselves this whole time.

499
00:34:25,592 --> 00:34:28,254
I’ve tried so hard to convince myself of otherwise but…

500
00:34:28,982 --> 00:34:30,283
I can’t pretend anymore.

501
00:34:30,502 --> 00:34:32,555
- Nah, this isn’t you talking.
- It is, Luke.

502
00:34:32,658 --> 00:34:35,888
I don’t wanna end up some bitter man who punishes Haley for what I could have been.

503
00:34:36,078 --> 00:34:37,630
She deserves better than that.

504
00:34:37,784 --> 00:34:38,536
So do I.

505
00:34:38,623 --> 00:34:39,897
No, you love Haley, Nathan!

506
00:34:39,975 --> 00:34:41,035
It’s not enough!

507
00:34:41,541 --> 00:34:42,257
Alright?

508
00:34:42,815 --> 00:34:46,303
Listen, I thought this marriage was gonna make both of our lives better…

509
00:34:46,538 --> 00:34:49,288
but all it ended up doing was getting in the way of our dreams and…

510
00:34:49,595 --> 00:34:53,035
Lucas, it’s time for me to focus, now; on basketball and my mom’s recovery.

511
00:34:56,451 --> 00:34:57,573
It’ll be better this way.

512
00:34:59,170 --> 00:35:00,521
Just don’t do this, man.

513
00:35:01,192 --> 00:35:02,754
Don’t let him win.

514
00:35:02,877 --> 00:35:04,769
I’ll do anything I can to help you.

515
00:35:04,868 --> 00:35:06,598
Then stop going after Dan.

516
00:35:08,007 --> 00:35:10,597
Lucas, I know the man’s no saint…

517
00:35:11,334 --> 00:35:13,248
but I think my mom’s ready to give him…

518
00:35:13,756 --> 00:35:15,918
ready to give our family another try.

519
00:35:16,895 --> 00:35:19,626
Nathan, you’re not that naïve, you know Dan’ll never change.

520
00:35:19,687 --> 00:35:21,074
You may be right, but…

521
00:35:22,190 --> 00:35:24,233
I owe it to my mom to give this a try.

522
00:35:24,811 --> 00:35:26,818
So can I count on you to back off?

523
00:35:33,501 --> 00:35:34,195
Yeah.

524
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:41,851
And since all that cool new stuff went back to its home… my closet’s looking pretty bleak

525
00:35:41,922 --> 00:35:45,931
so I’m gonna shove all Lucas’ junk back in and then head to a movie.

526
00:35:48,078 --> 00:35:49,556
Hey, Peyton, was it worth it?

527
00:35:51,170 --> 00:35:52,587
Giving your heart to Jake?

528
00:35:54,155 --> 00:35:55,352
Absolutely.

529
00:35:55,587 --> 00:35:57,543
Even with the way things turned out?

530
00:35:57,938 --> 00:36:00,174
He’s in jail and you’re alone and hurting.

531
00:36:00,263 --> 00:36:04,706
But I’ve also been happier than I thought possible. So…

532
00:36:05,086 --> 00:36:09,034
I don’t know, I mean, being in love; that’s how you know you’re alive, right?

533
00:36:09,156 --> 00:36:13,472
Maybe. I’m starting to wonder how much one heart can take.

534
00:36:13,554 --> 00:36:16,743
Well, there’s only one way to find out, so just…

535
00:36:17,041 --> 00:36:19,852
call Lucas. It’s just a movie.

536
00:36:20,322 --> 00:36:24,143
Plus, wouldn’t you rather take a chance than always wonder what could have been?

537
00:36:29,407 --> 00:36:30,935
I’ll call you later, okay?

538
00:36:44,844 --> 00:36:45,934
Hey, Brooke?

539
00:36:46,004 --> 00:36:47,910
Hey, back atcha. You busy?

540
00:36:47,991 --> 00:36:50,274
Nah, I’m just grabbing some coffee. What’s up?

541
00:36:50,990 --> 00:36:54,007
We’ve been doing really well with this whole friends thing, right?

542
00:36:54,126 --> 00:36:55,350
Yeah, we have.

543
00:36:55,993 --> 00:37:00,039
Yeah, I think so, too. So, I wanted to ask you something.

544
00:37:00,418 --> 00:37:01,210
Um…

545
00:37:02,715 --> 00:37:03,905
Ah, hold on.

546
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:22,158
Hey, Brooke, you still there?

547
00:37:22,485 --> 00:37:23,233
Yeah.

548
00:37:23,434 --> 00:37:24,293
Okay.

549
00:37:24,589 --> 00:37:25,696
What’d you wanna ask me?

550
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:34,681
Let’s not screw this up, now, okay?

551
00:37:36,422 --> 00:37:37,139
Okay.

552
00:37:40,369 --> 00:37:41,301
Bye, Lucas.

553
00:37:56,933 --> 00:37:57,808
You okay?

554
00:37:58,596 --> 00:37:59,703
Yeah, I think so.

555
00:38:00,087 --> 00:38:01,372
Uh, why’d you wanna meet?

556
00:38:01,541 --> 00:38:05,560
Well, I’ve found out where at least ninety-five thousand of Dan’s skimmed money’s going.

557
00:38:06,139 --> 00:38:07,162
That’s great, where?

558
00:38:07,747 --> 00:38:10,772
Seems he’s been making a lot of small cash deposits…

559
00:38:11,162 --> 00:38:13,497
into a college fund. For you.

560
00:38:15,979 --> 00:38:18,335
I don’t get it. Why would he do that?

561
00:38:18,412 --> 00:38:21,350
He could be using the fund to hide the cash before he moves it elsewhere.

562
00:38:21,530 --> 00:38:25,375
Or… in some screwed-up way, maybe Dan really does care for ya.

563
00:38:28,032 --> 00:38:30,428
Look, Lucas, nobody knows about this, yet.

564
00:38:30,817 --> 00:38:33,490
If you want, I can just destroy the papers and call it a day.

565
00:38:34,243 --> 00:38:35,927
You wanna quit going after him?

566
00:38:36,219 --> 00:38:37,432
That’s your decision.

567
00:38:38,196 --> 00:38:41,780
I don’t know what I’m gonna turn up and I really don’t care. Dan’s nothing to me.

568
00:38:42,413 --> 00:38:44,017
Somebody’s gotta end it.

569
00:38:45,082 --> 00:38:46,884
He hurts everybody he touches.

570
00:38:47,758 --> 00:38:49,014
But he is your father.

571
00:38:50,146 --> 00:38:52,823
So, you tell me: do I keep digging?

572
00:38:59,003 --> 00:38:59,865
Yes.

573
00:39:02,147 --> 00:39:05,178
Don’t stop until you have everything.

574
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:07,564
Okay.

575
00:39:22,368 --> 00:39:24,241
I thought you were going to see your husband.

576
00:39:25,797 --> 00:39:26,876
What husband?

577
00:39:56,342 --> 00:39:57,694
Sure this is what you want?

578
00:39:59,214 --> 00:39:59,943
Yeah.

579
00:40:00,792 --> 00:40:03,742
It’s gonna be great having you both here. You’ll see.

580
00:40:05,067 --> 00:40:07,587
Uh… actually…

581
00:40:08,751 --> 00:40:09,838
I’m moving home.

582
00:40:10,202 --> 00:40:11,114
What?

583
00:40:13,817 --> 00:40:15,675
Why? There’s plenty of room for all of us.

584
00:40:20,558 --> 00:40:21,533
It’s just time.

585
00:40:32,552 --> 00:40:33,308
Thank you.

586
00:40:33,909 --> 00:40:34,686
Any time.

587
00:40:37,504 --> 00:40:40,324
- I’m home.
- Oh, I’m so glad.

588
00:40:41,072 --> 00:40:42,028
Me too, mom.

589
00:40:45,034 --> 00:40:45,843
Hey, Brooke.

590
00:40:46,740 --> 00:40:47,482
Hey.

591
00:40:58,838 --> 00:41:03,691
Well, now that we are all here together, we need to set some new ground rules.

592
00:41:03,769 --> 00:41:05,650
I know that the two of you had a history.

593
00:41:05,734 --> 00:41:08,914
Oh, don’t worry, Karen, we’re just friends.

594
00:41:09,548 --> 00:41:10,674
Nothing more.
