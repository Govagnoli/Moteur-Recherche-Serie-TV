1
00:01:42,683 --> 00:01:43,718
Truth is hard.

2
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:47,471
But Hostility stays outside. Who would like to start?

3
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:50,314
Well, you’re the one with all the answers, Doc, why don’t you tell us?

4
00:01:50,457 --> 00:01:53,011
- Hostility stays outside, Dan.
- Things have just gotten out of hand,

5
00:01:53,118 --> 00:01:54,886
- so, we thought we could use some…
- No, you thought.

6
00:01:54,967 --> 00:01:58,838
- … objectivity.
- Define “gotten out of hand”. Nathan?

7
00:01:59,147 --> 00:01:59,939
Pass.

8
00:02:02,924 --> 00:02:06,984
We reached the breaking point two weeks ago when my son…

9
00:02:07,082 --> 00:02:10,061
- You hear that? “My son”.
- Deb is speaking now, Dan.

10
00:02:10,134 --> 00:02:15,494
When our son collapsed on the basketball court after taking drugs to boost his performance.

11
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:17,110
The kid made a mistake, he knows that.

12
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:20,910
His father has been bullying him about the sport since he was old enough to hold a ball.

13
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:22,490
Is that true, Nathan?

14
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,660
His mother is so quick to put the blame on me, but up until recently, job always came first.

15
00:02:26,729 --> 00:02:29,374
Yes, but I changed my behavior Dan, you haven’t.

16
00:02:29,656 --> 00:02:33,178
You cant seem to loose this unhealthy obsession you have with basketball,

17
00:02:33,235 --> 00:02:35,810
- and how Nathan plays it.
- She blames me for her shortcomings as a mother.

18
00:02:35,869 --> 00:02:38,734
Okay, I think we got some things out in the open.

19
00:02:39,752 --> 00:02:43,290
Nathan, do you think that basketball is part of your families problem?

20
00:02:44,284 --> 00:02:46,414
- Part of.
- But you still like playing?

21
00:02:46,895 --> 00:02:47,899
I don’t know anymore.

22
00:02:49,595 --> 00:02:51,031
Great, nice break through Nate.

23
00:02:51,811 --> 00:02:52,599
Thanks, Doc.

24
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:56,797
- Dan.
- Hustle up! No way this is helping.

25
00:02:59,972 --> 00:03:04,252
You’re right, Dan, we don’t need a shrink to identify this families problem, you just made it obvious.

26
00:03:04,339 --> 00:03:05,692
I’m not his only parent, Deb.

27
00:03:06,316 --> 00:03:10,012
- Hey why don’t you ride with your old man, Nathan. 
- Stop it, Dan. Come on Nathan, lets go.

28
00:03:10,115 --> 00:03:12,741
Let the kid make up his own mind. What do you say, son?

29
00:03:15,335 --> 00:03:16,172
Nate?

30
00:03:18,845 --> 00:03:19,691
Nathan!

31
00:03:21,745 --> 00:03:24,835
Here we go. This is the writer I was talking about.

32
00:03:25,852 --> 00:03:27,437
Somerset Maugham?

33
00:03:27,887 --> 00:03:29,213
Well its, “Maugham”

34
00:03:29,835 --> 00:03:32,229
- Human Bondage.
- Bondage!

35
00:03:33,698 --> 00:03:34,962
Yeah, its not like that.

36
00:03:36,474 --> 00:03:39,561
So, you’re good. Are we done here?

37
00:03:40,764 --> 00:03:45,447
Well, I just thought that this was a better opportunity for us to spend some time,

38
00:03:45,617 --> 00:03:46,626
you know, hang out with each other.

39
00:03:46,724 --> 00:03:52,274
And it is, but can we maybe do it someplace that smells a little less funky?

40
00:03:52,878 --> 00:03:56,042
Haha, it’s the smell of old books.

41
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:59,928
Like I said! Come on, its my turn. Please?

42
00:04:03,194 --> 00:04:04,448
Just keep it legal.

43
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:27,586
Wait, you sure your parents wont come home?

44
00:04:28,677 --> 00:04:29,347
They could.

45
00:04:30,551 --> 00:04:32,778
But, this isn’t their Jacuzzi.

46
00:04:35,461 --> 00:04:37,883
Brooke… whose house is this?

47
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:39,623
I don’t know!

48
00:04:40,584 --> 00:04:41,498
Does it matter?

49
00:05:01,774 --> 00:05:02,591
Here you go.

50
00:05:04,538 --> 00:05:06,801
Wow, for the diet special that looks pretty damn tasty.

51
00:05:08,091 --> 00:05:10,195
Oh! Sorry.

52
00:05:14,825 --> 00:05:16,958
Things have worked out pretty well, huh?

53
00:05:17,926 --> 00:05:20,005
Karen’s café gets to stay open,

54
00:05:20,604 --> 00:05:22,775
and I get to see a little more of my sister-in-law.

55
00:05:23,937 --> 00:05:25,151
So, how are you doing with things?

56
00:05:26,744 --> 00:05:31,566
Uh, we had our first counseling session yesterday.

57
00:05:31,648 --> 00:05:35,853
Dan and counseling. It’s kind of like Hannibal Lector at a salad bar.

58
00:05:38,234 --> 00:05:40,706
Well, if you think it would help, I’d be happy to talk to Nathan.

59
00:05:41,213 --> 00:05:42,262
I think he’d like that.

60
00:05:48,102 --> 00:05:51,893
I know you like my women, Keith, but come on! Deb’s still my wife.

61
00:05:52,057 --> 00:05:53,640
Won’t be for long if you keep this up.

62
00:06:00,822 --> 00:06:02,610
I’m taking Nathan to dinner tonight.

63
00:06:03,142 --> 00:06:04,162
Do you have a problem with that?

64
00:06:04,468 --> 00:06:07,693
- Yeah. He needs a break from you.
- You can't stop me from seeing my own son.

65
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:12,450
Oh, actually I can. By telling you nicely, or calling a lawyer. Your choice.

66
00:06:14,872 --> 00:06:16,331
Tell him I’ll pick him up at 7.

67
00:06:21,436 --> 00:06:24,109
Tell Nathan to come see me. I’ll do what I can.

68
00:06:36,961 --> 00:06:37,662
Peyton?

69
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:49,889
Peyton!

70
00:07:03,226 --> 00:07:05,759
- Where’s Peyton?
- Dressing for school is my guess.

71
00:07:06,164 --> 00:07:06,984
Who are you?

72
00:07:08,197 --> 00:07:12,421
I’m the guy who’s about to take that rake from you and beat your scrawny ass.

73
00:07:14,463 --> 00:07:15,924
I’m her dad. Who are you?

74
00:07:16,016 --> 00:07:18,816
Oh. Sorry.

75
00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:22,559
The front door was open and I thought…

76
00:07:24,162 --> 00:07:24,903
I’m Lucas.

77
00:07:25,395 --> 00:07:26,220
Larry Sawyer.

78
00:07:26,675 --> 00:07:27,792
Hey dad, do you know where my…

79
00:07:29,384 --> 00:07:30,331
What are you doing here?

80
00:07:30,531 --> 00:07:32,911
Oh he’s trying to rake me to death.

81
00:07:33,366 --> 00:07:33,992
What?!

82
00:07:35,942 --> 00:07:37,939
I thought you were…

83
00:07:39,777 --> 00:07:40,499
nothing crucial.

84
00:07:42,205 --> 00:07:43,238
I’m gonna go put this back.

85
00:07:48,108 --> 00:07:50,002
- So, who’s the guy?
- What guy?

86
00:07:50,177 --> 00:07:51,568
The one that’s got you smiling.

87
00:07:52,148 --> 00:07:53,442
That’d be my dad.

88
00:07:53,734 --> 00:07:56,525
Oh, I’d be smiling too but for entirely different reasons.

89
00:07:57,150 --> 00:08:00,580
Dude, that’s my dad! Don’t go all horndog on me. There’s a line!

90
00:08:01,281 --> 00:08:05,752
Speaking of which, I really don’t wanna cross any so tell me if this is totally inappropriate to ask.

91
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:07,180
When has that every stopped you?

92
00:08:07,524 --> 00:08:09,551
I need to connect more with Lucas.

93
00:08:09,633 --> 00:08:11,046
I thought you guys were already doing that.

94
00:08:11,603 --> 00:08:15,756
I mean, the making out thing is great and all but it only goes so far.

95
00:08:16,447 --> 00:08:17,641
Can you help a girl out?

96
00:08:19,617 --> 00:08:21,490
Yeah. You know what?

97
00:08:25,534 --> 00:08:26,487
Give him this.

98
00:08:27,741 --> 00:08:28,499
Travis.

99
00:08:28,658 --> 00:08:34,563
Yeah, Tell him that tracks 8 and 11 make you think of him.

100
00:08:34,832 --> 00:08:38,110
Great.  Wait, make me think of him or make you think of him?

101
00:08:38,304 --> 00:08:39,247
Just friends.

102
00:08:39,555 --> 00:08:42,632
I know, sorry. You’re a goddess.

103
00:08:48,176 --> 00:08:49,519
Did you finish ‘The Little Prince’?

104
00:08:50,194 --> 00:08:53,429
No, I just rented the movie. This book is stupid.

105
00:08:54,361 --> 00:08:57,259
Nathan, you’re not going to pass French if you keep renting movies.

106
00:08:57,316 --> 00:08:59,615
Well, its not like I have a lot of time to just sit around and read.

107
00:09:01,483 --> 00:09:04,202
So, are you ever going to tell me how it went?

108
00:09:07,499 --> 00:09:10,607
The therapist asked me if I really want to play basketball or not.

109
00:09:10,914 --> 00:09:11,984
Wow, what did you say?

110
00:09:12,891 --> 00:09:14,206
I  didn’t know what to say.

111
00:09:15,322 --> 00:09:16,885
Nobody’s ever asked me that question.

112
00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:18,369
Wow, that’s really big.

113
00:09:18,445 --> 00:09:20,735
This last couple of weeks without it,

114
00:09:22,010 --> 00:09:26,276
I mean if I didn’t play I might actually have a life.

115
00:09:26,443 --> 00:09:28,216
- What would you do?
- I don’t know.

116
00:09:29,306 --> 00:09:31,339
At least I’d have some time to figure it out though.

117
00:09:32,747 --> 00:09:36,617
Besides, I’m sure we could find a lot better things to do with our time, right?

118
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:37,487
You think?

119
00:09:41,044 --> 00:09:42,649
I think you’re really brave.

120
00:09:43,196 --> 00:09:44,973
To consider rebuilding who you are.

121
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:47,885
I don’t know if I could do that.

122
00:09:48,705 --> 00:09:49,207
You could.

123
00:09:55,003 --> 00:09:56,969
- Well, I gotta go.
- Oh yeah.

124
00:09:59,607 --> 00:10:02,698
Hey, um, practice starts back up again today, right?

125
00:10:04,071 --> 00:10:07,921
Yeah, I’m just not sure if I do.

126
00:10:10,837 --> 00:10:11,639
I’ll see ya.

127
00:10:23,849 --> 00:10:27,142
All work and no Brooke make Luke a boring boy.

128
00:10:27,761 --> 00:10:29,435
- Hey.
- I got you something.

129
00:10:30,583 --> 00:10:32,072
But I don’t have anything for you.

130
00:10:32,462 --> 00:10:33,598
And yet you do.

131
00:10:35,574 --> 00:10:39,394
A couple of songs on there that made me think of you. Of course most things do.

132
00:10:39,690 --> 00:10:40,734
I didn’t know you were into Travis.

133
00:10:40,808 --> 00:10:43,361
Are you kidding, I love Travis. He’s the best.

134
00:10:44,018 --> 00:10:45,010
Who?

135
00:10:45,298 --> 00:10:48,759
Travis guy. Are we not in the same conversation?

136
00:10:50,785 --> 00:10:53,439
Check out tracks 8 and 13. You’ll love them.

137
00:10:55,111 --> 00:10:55,983
Bye.

138
00:11:04,066 --> 00:11:05,363
Thought you might want that back.

139
00:11:06,265 --> 00:11:07,171
I already have it.

140
00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:08,763
So do I.

141
00:11:11,618 --> 00:11:14,528
Tracks 8 and 11? Totally you.

142
00:11:15,357 --> 00:11:18,578
So what are you doing? Some sort of serrano thing for Brooke?

143
00:11:19,521 --> 00:11:21,682
- Why would I do that?
- Well, I asked you first

144
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:27,930
Look, don’t underestimate Brooke. She’s full of surprises. Its just part of her charm.

145
00:11:29,610 --> 00:11:31,540
She told me to listen to track 13.

146
00:11:32,990 --> 00:11:35,140
There are only 12 songs.

147
00:11:35,648 --> 00:11:36,724
Honest mistake.

148
00:11:38,008 --> 00:11:39,918
Yeah, I guess.

149
00:11:41,496 --> 00:11:48,244
Anyway, sorry about this morning with your dad. I had no idea he was there.

150
00:11:48,817 --> 00:11:50,271
It’s cause he usually isn’t.

151
00:11:51,341 --> 00:11:52,786
I thought you were happy with your setup.

152
00:11:54,870 --> 00:11:56,067
That’s what I tell him.

153
00:11:56,620 --> 00:12:00,998
I make up stuff in the emails I send him about how happy I am being on my own,

154
00:12:01,162 --> 00:12:04,399
and how responsible I’m being even when I’m not.

155
00:12:05,662 --> 00:12:07,849
He loves his job, you know?

156
00:12:08,192 --> 00:12:13,122
And after my mom died, it’s just not fair to ask him to give that up.

157
00:12:15,468 --> 00:12:17,019
But I miss him when he’s away.

158
00:12:21,125 --> 00:12:21,944
You tell him that?

159
00:12:23,285 --> 00:12:27,786
He worries. It’s just better not to.

160
00:12:31,586 --> 00:12:34,909
So listen, I don’t have a lot of quiet time these days.

161
00:12:36,004 --> 00:12:37,729
You mind if I just sit and read while you draw?

162
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:40,438
As long as you don’t act out the parts.

163
00:12:42,383 --> 00:12:43,310
Alright.

164
00:13:10,462 --> 00:13:11,966
My mom said you wanted to see me.

165
00:13:13,386 --> 00:13:14,010
Yeah.

166
00:13:17,046 --> 00:13:18,356
Hand me that ratchet, would you?

167
00:13:22,638 --> 00:13:23,701
So how are you holding up?

168
00:13:23,768 --> 00:13:25,279
Why? Are you going to report it back to my mom?

169
00:13:27,608 --> 00:13:28,900
It’s not like that, Nate.

170
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:32,279
Look, I know you and I haven’t talked very much.

171
00:13:32,601 --> 00:13:38,048
And I’m sorry about that. But that’s just fall out from your dad and me.

172
00:13:39,276 --> 00:13:43,020
I know you’re going through some tough times so, if you need anything...

173
00:13:45,929 --> 00:13:47,915
Well, let me ask you something.

174
00:13:49,377 --> 00:13:50,920
You played basketball in high school, right?

175
00:13:51,356 --> 00:13:53,281
- Only for a little while. 
- You didn’t enjoy it?

176
00:13:53,891 --> 00:13:58,380
What are you kidding me? I loved it! But there was no pressure then.

177
00:13:59,118 --> 00:14:01,508
And then I didn’t love it so much anymore.

178
00:14:01,969 --> 00:14:06,274
Your dad came up and just made everything a competition.

179
00:14:07,709 --> 00:14:09,029
So then you just walked away?

180
00:14:09,547 --> 00:14:11,206
Only looked back at the cheerleaders.

181
00:14:13,336 --> 00:14:16,577
It’s just a game, Nate. Not a life.

182
00:14:19,347 --> 00:14:23,643
Hey spirit girl. That cheerleading thing always throws me off.

183
00:14:23,997 --> 00:14:24,692
What?

184
00:14:24,916 --> 00:14:27,574
Just the more I get to know you the harder it is to wrap my head around it.

185
00:14:28,107 --> 00:14:32,190
My mom used to cheer and Brooke and I have been cheering together forever so it’s just kind of our thing.

186
00:14:32,297 --> 00:14:33,483
- Oh cool. 
- What’s up?

187
00:14:34,291 --> 00:14:40,282
So, um, I need some advice. About Nathan. I don’t know if its crossing a line.

188
00:14:40,708 --> 00:14:42,284
Okay, funny wasn’t what I was going for but..

189
00:14:42,510 --> 00:14:45,019
I was the queen of boyfriend-dysfunction and now I guess

190
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:48,787
I’m everybody’s go-to on relationship advice its just kind of bizarre, right?

191
00:14:48,864 --> 00:14:50,415
If it’s too weird then…

192
00:14:50,497 --> 00:14:54,005
No it’s cool. What’s going on?

193
00:14:54,266 --> 00:14:58,413
Well, um, Nathan’s talking about quitting the team.

194
00:14:58,511 --> 00:15:01,156
And I just, I don’t know what to say.

195
00:15:01,244 --> 00:15:05,253
Yeah, look I could never find the words to get through that big wall that he puts up

196
00:15:05,330 --> 00:15:07,619
so I really can’t help you out much.

197
00:15:08,657 --> 00:15:11,229
But you’re so much better with him than I ever was.

198
00:15:12,104 --> 00:15:14,239
He’s lucky to have you.

199
00:15:14,776 --> 00:15:15,344
Thanks.

200
00:15:16,661 --> 00:15:18,212
I  don’t want to keep you from your practice.

201
00:15:18,401 --> 00:15:19,774
Hmm. Go Ravens.

202
00:15:20,937 --> 00:15:25,032
Hey, um, I didn’t mean anything, about your mom.

203
00:15:26,834 --> 00:15:27,557
It’s cool.

204
00:15:28,298 --> 00:15:28,948
Okay.

205
00:15:33,065 --> 00:15:34,863
You could have told me Travis was a group.

206
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,803
It’s not like it’s some big secret.

207
00:15:37,602 --> 00:15:41,396
Lucas gave me the weirdest look when I said that. I felt so stupid.

208
00:15:41,458 --> 00:15:44,656
You’re not stupid. You guys just don’t like the same things.

209
00:15:44,724 --> 00:15:49,972
See, that’s the problem. He brings up art and books and I’ve got nothing.

210
00:15:55,207 --> 00:15:56,454
- Hey you.
- Hey you.

211
00:15:57,115 --> 00:15:57,791
And you.

212
00:15:59,986 --> 00:16:01,584
Welcome back, gentlemen.

213
00:16:01,943 --> 00:16:05,772
Lets see how soft you all got after that little hiatus.

214
00:16:06,668 --> 00:16:09,827
Suicides. Now.

215
00:16:12,377 --> 00:16:15,290
Better be a basketball in that thing, Jagielski.

216
00:16:15,530 --> 00:16:17,917
Come on, Coach. It’s either this or I miss practice.

217
00:16:18,501 --> 00:16:23,520
Alright, we'll find her a spot with a good view so that she can watch her daddy throw up.

218
00:16:24,348 --> 00:16:25,648
I’ll take her, Jake.

219
00:16:25,756 --> 00:16:26,473
Yeah?

220
00:16:32,684 --> 00:16:33,395
Thanks, Peyton.

221
00:16:33,682 --> 00:16:34,341
Glad to.

222
00:16:35,392 --> 00:16:36,590
Alright, gather around.

223
00:16:40,148 --> 00:16:40,978
Where’s Nathan?

224
00:16:42,166 --> 00:16:44,967
Tim, you’re his girlfriend, where is he?

225
00:16:45,054 --> 00:16:47,280
I don’t know, coach. He was at school today.

226
00:16:48,663 --> 00:16:49,410
Alright.

227
00:16:50,732 --> 00:16:53,369
I’ve got some offensive sets worked out here.

228
00:16:54,055 --> 00:16:55,668
Line up at the low stacks.

229
00:17:06,002 --> 00:17:07,393
So I had an idea.

230
00:17:08,381 --> 00:17:09,164
Okay.

231
00:17:10,161 --> 00:17:12,477
Remember when I read that Steinberg book?

232
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:13,592
Steinbeck.

233
00:17:13,726 --> 00:17:17,237
Yeah, that guy. And then you did something that I wanted.

234
00:17:17,365 --> 00:17:20,300
Oh yeah, yeah. Getting drunk, tattooed and grounded?

235
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:21,395
But in a fun way.

236
00:17:22,507 --> 00:17:23,966
I’m thinking we should try that again.

237
00:17:24,022 --> 00:17:26,142
Okay, you might want to run that by Keith first.

238
00:17:26,266 --> 00:17:31,901
Not exactly that, I just, I want to know everything about you.

239
00:17:32,982 --> 00:17:37,520
And I want you to know… almost everything about me.

240
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:40,181
- What’s going on, Brooke?
- Nothing.

241
00:17:40,862 --> 00:17:44,221
I just... I want to know you better, Luke.

242
00:17:45,157 --> 00:17:49,382
So how about, the next time you do something you love, you bring me along,

243
00:17:49,863 --> 00:17:50,989
and then we trade.

244
00:17:51,877 --> 00:17:53,964
Are you busy after practice tomorrow?

245
00:17:54,205 --> 00:17:54,875
Yeah,

246
00:17:57,267 --> 00:17:58,485
I have a date with you.

247
00:18:06,806 --> 00:18:09,457
Half with olives. We aim to please.

248
00:18:09,533 --> 00:18:12,095
Well, you hit the bulls eye Tara.

249
00:18:15,658 --> 00:18:17,921
What? You know how I like to kid around.

250
00:18:18,105 --> 00:18:19,611
Yeah, you’re famous for it.

251
00:18:20,901 --> 00:18:23,276
Dad, you really think that’s gonna help what’s going on?

252
00:18:23,681 --> 00:18:28,400
Look, you know I think this counseling crap is ridiculous but I promised your mom I’d try again.

253
00:18:29,189 --> 00:18:30,220
We’ll be okay.

254
00:18:30,577 --> 00:18:31,264
Right.

255
00:18:31,975 --> 00:18:33,343
You just focus on your game.

256
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:35,780
Whitey kick your ass today?

257
00:18:39,010 --> 00:18:40,143
I didn’t go to practice.

258
00:18:44,172 --> 00:18:45,579
What’s going on with you, Nate?

259
00:18:46,005 --> 00:18:49,296
Nothing, I just need some time. Okay?

260
00:18:49,373 --> 00:18:51,708
No its not okay. It’s career suicide.

261
00:18:51,989 --> 00:18:54,156
- Dad, Keith said…
- Keith said!

262
00:18:55,164 --> 00:18:59,869
You talked to Keith? You take advice from Keith you’ll end up spending the rest of your life

263
00:18:59,926 --> 00:19:02,531
running a second rate auto garage. Is that what you want?

264
00:19:05,690 --> 00:19:06,688
I told you.

265
00:19:08,422 --> 00:19:10,382
I don’t know what I want.

266
00:19:27,069 --> 00:19:28,173
That’s just freaky.

267
00:19:28,265 --> 00:19:30,574
Where do you get off telling Nathan he can quit the team?

268
00:19:30,656 --> 00:19:32,126
I didn’t tell him he could quit.

269
00:19:33,508 --> 00:19:36,068
He wanted to talk, we talked.

270
00:19:36,656 --> 00:19:37,988
Maybe you ought to try it, sometimes.

271
00:19:38,050 --> 00:19:41,495
So you neglect him most of his life, I’m out of the house a week, and there you are?

272
00:19:41,578 --> 00:19:43,057
He surprised me, Dan.

273
00:19:44,459 --> 00:19:45,924
You know, Nathan’s a good kid.

274
00:19:46,134 --> 00:19:48,622
You got him so screwed up he doesn’t know what he wants.

275
00:19:48,669 --> 00:19:50,332
Deb got her hand up your back, Keith?

276
00:19:50,722 --> 00:19:53,477
Deb’s the best thing Nathan’s got going for him right now.

277
00:19:53,686 --> 00:19:56,461
- She’s trying to save him.
- What the hell do you think I’m trying to do?

278
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,891
I’ve been trying to figure that out all these years, Danny.

279
00:20:00,829 --> 00:20:03,425
I don’t mind you playing Daddy to one of my offspring,

280
00:20:03,495 --> 00:20:05,073
but leave the good one alone, would you?

281
00:20:11,585 --> 00:20:14,218
Hey Peyton. Missing these?

282
00:20:14,733 --> 00:20:18,052
Those are the keys to the squads equipment cabinet.

283
00:20:18,236 --> 00:20:21,958
I gave them to Jenny yesterday to play with. She was shaking them like a pom pom.

284
00:20:22,603 --> 00:20:23,756
Maybe she’ll be a cheerleader.

285
00:20:24,023 --> 00:20:25,896
Or President. You gotta think big.

286
00:20:26,138 --> 00:20:28,911
Alright, you never know. Whatever makes her happy.

287
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:32,425
You know, I think its really amazing how committed to her you are.

288
00:20:34,462 --> 00:20:40,048
Well, its really not that hard. I mean, from the moment I saw her I was totally hooked.

289
00:20:40,375 --> 00:20:45,491
She’s just so cute. And I think about watching her grow up.

290
00:20:46,237 --> 00:20:48,164
I couldn’t imagine not being there.

291
00:20:49,721 --> 00:20:51,768
You know, I bet you’re a really great dad.

292
00:20:52,784 --> 00:20:54,072
I don’t know.

293
00:20:55,102 --> 00:20:56,367
Some days I wonder.

294
00:21:04,932 --> 00:21:05,884
Hey Nathan.

295
00:21:06,391 --> 00:21:06,872
Hey.

296
00:21:07,977 --> 00:21:08,910
Missed you at practice.

297
00:21:10,087 --> 00:21:12,923
Look man, you don’t have to be nice to me cause I’m going out with Haley, okay?

298
00:21:13,007 --> 00:21:16,426
I’m not. Team sucks on a day without you man.

299
00:21:16,718 --> 00:21:17,455
Ask Whitey.

300
00:21:18,771 --> 00:21:20,015
I’m  trying to avoid him.

301
00:21:21,623 --> 00:21:24,438
That’s cool. Do what you got to do.

302
00:21:24,925 --> 00:21:25,750
Usually do.

303
00:21:26,677 --> 00:21:29,563
Am I hallucinating? Did I just see you talking to Lucas?

304
00:21:29,846 --> 00:21:31,613
No, he was trying to talk to me.

305
00:21:32,545 --> 00:21:34,547
The whole nice guy thing’s wearing kind of thin.

306
00:21:35,796 --> 00:21:37,024
You want to walk to English?

307
00:21:37,214 --> 00:21:40,849
Actually, I think I’m gonna cut out of here a little bit early. Wanna join me?

308
00:21:41,443 --> 00:21:42,395
Are you serious?

309
00:21:42,550 --> 00:21:44,756
Yeah, why not? You up for it?

310
00:21:46,007 --> 00:21:47,413
I can’t, Nathan.

311
00:21:47,951 --> 00:21:51,832
Alright. Well, look, I gotta get out of here so I’ll catch you later.

312
00:21:51,908 --> 00:21:52,600
Okay.

313
00:21:55,841 --> 00:21:59,532
You know what? Catch me now.

314
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:08,806
- Oh My God! 
- Nice, huh?

315
00:22:17,270 --> 00:22:19,664
So, are we trying to get killed?

316
00:22:19,742 --> 00:22:22,506
I told you, my dad’s in Charlotte, it’s okay.

317
00:22:23,478 --> 00:22:25,823
I’ve never seen you like this.

318
00:22:27,842 --> 00:22:28,911
Now you have.

319
00:22:36,005 --> 00:22:37,809
- Let’s go inside.
- Okay.

320
00:22:40,556 --> 00:22:44,133
- Okay, 1...3...5...
- Okay.

321
00:22:44,384 --> 00:22:45,998
- Got it?
- Yeah I’m good.

322
00:22:48,572 --> 00:22:50,615
Oh, stop moving the pier.

323
00:22:56,176 --> 00:22:57,300
Nice knowing you.

324
00:22:59,012 --> 00:23:02,202
You’ve got Mason Bowl next week and this is how you’re training?

325
00:23:02,273 --> 00:23:04,444
- Can we do this later?
- There may not be a later for you.

326
00:23:04,634 --> 00:23:06,672
- Oh, oh Mr. Scott...
- Was I talking to you?

327
00:23:06,734 --> 00:23:08,336
Get in the car. I’m driving you both home.

328
00:23:10,297 --> 00:23:13,302
You’re mother’s going to love this. You getting drunk on her watch…

329
00:23:24,546 --> 00:23:28,933
There’s some kind of interesting news that I need to talk to you about.

330
00:23:31,106 --> 00:23:32,676
Why does interesting scare me?

331
00:23:32,749 --> 00:23:37,781
No, no. Listen, the company’s been hired to do some flood control.

332
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:39,374
They want me to supervise.

333
00:23:40,296 --> 00:23:41,570
How long is it going to be this time?

334
00:23:41,675 --> 00:23:46,326
Well, seeing that it is in New Zealand, um, 3 maybe 4 months.

335
00:23:50,074 --> 00:23:51,544
So, what’s the upside?

336
00:23:53,771 --> 00:23:56,832
It’s a lot of money, sweetie. Way more than I make now.

337
00:23:58,036 --> 00:24:02,588
We could be good to go for a while. Maybe even afford that art school you talk about.

338
00:24:03,309 --> 00:24:04,727
Is this something that you want?

339
00:24:05,670 --> 00:24:07,668
I only want to do this if it’s right for us.

340
00:24:12,141 --> 00:24:13,284
You should do it, dad.

341
00:24:22,725 --> 00:24:23,810
What happened to you?

342
00:24:24,199 --> 00:24:25,530
Nice to see you too.

343
00:24:26,944 --> 00:24:28,228
Yeah, I missed you in sixth period.

344
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:31,178
Yeah, I kind of skipped.

345
00:24:33,403 --> 00:24:35,729
You can get your jaw off the floor now.

346
00:24:35,939 --> 00:24:37,246
He’s got you skipping school?

347
00:24:37,323 --> 00:24:39,308
Lucas, talk to me when you get your tattoo removed.

348
00:24:41,191 --> 00:24:42,355
Alright.

349
00:24:47,296 --> 00:24:48,242
Lucas!

350
00:24:48,848 --> 00:24:49,513
What are you doing?

351
00:24:49,662 --> 00:24:50,788
I’m taking care of my little girl.

352
00:24:50,865 --> 00:24:53,988
You are such a trouble maker. Daddy stop it, come on. Don’t. Stop.

353
00:24:54,931 --> 00:24:56,804
Hey, sit down, Rake Boy.

354
00:24:56,946 --> 00:25:00,158
Hey. I’m never gonna live that one down.

355
00:25:00,634 --> 00:25:01,693
Probably not.

356
00:25:02,487 --> 00:25:04,566
It’s okay, he can be way worse.

357
00:25:05,888 --> 00:25:06,754
What have you got there?

358
00:25:08,452 --> 00:25:12,390
- You’re reading Faulkner in school now?
- No, I just love his stuff.

359
00:25:46,024 --> 00:25:49,223
So what did you do last night? I saw you with Peyton.

360
00:25:49,659 --> 00:25:50,714
What are you talking about?

361
00:25:51,154 --> 00:25:52,628
You two just looked pretty friendly.

362
00:25:52,915 --> 00:25:55,162
Well, that’s because we’re friends.

363
00:25:55,250 --> 00:25:56,145
And what are we?

364
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:58,834
Well, I thought that we were dating.

365
00:25:59,848 --> 00:26:01,830
Well, it looked more like you were dating Peyton.

366
00:26:02,921 --> 00:26:04,046
How messed up is that?

367
00:26:05,009 --> 00:26:05,781
Brooke!

368
00:26:07,988 --> 00:26:08,798
What was that about?

369
00:26:08,956 --> 00:26:11,566
She's mad. She saw us together last night.

370
00:26:12,043 --> 00:26:16,149
I’ll talk to her. Explain to her how bored out of my skull I was

371
00:26:16,211 --> 00:26:18,511
listening to you and my dad talk about dead writers all night.

372
00:26:20,667 --> 00:26:24,455
You okay? You just seemed kind of weird when your dad called me over.

373
00:26:25,213 --> 00:26:28,607
He had just told me about this horrid job he’s taken in New Zealand,

374
00:26:28,669 --> 00:26:30,619
so he’s gonna be gone for like ever now.

375
00:26:30,753 --> 00:26:32,145
Well, did you tell him not to?

376
00:26:32,365 --> 00:26:33,344
It’s important to him.

377
00:26:33,451 --> 00:26:34,927
Yeah but he doesn’t know it’s important to you.

378
00:26:35,207 --> 00:26:39,083
You’ve got to stop pretending everything’s okay… he might surprise you.

379
00:26:51,009 --> 00:26:53,587
Oh hey. I almost gave up on you.

380
00:26:54,510 --> 00:26:56,776
- Lost track, sorry.
- It's okay.

381
00:26:57,774 --> 00:26:59,271
You still hung over?

382
00:26:59,357 --> 00:27:01,079
I’m not as bad as your dad’s pants.

383
00:27:02,548 --> 00:27:03,670
How great was that?

384
00:27:04,083 --> 00:27:04,733
Horrible.

385
00:27:06,828 --> 00:27:09,102
Let’s just tackle some geometry, okay?

386
00:27:09,915 --> 00:27:14,924
Or, Bottle Rocket is playing at this theater downtown. We could take the train.

387
00:27:14,999 --> 00:27:15,850
Are you serious?

388
00:27:15,987 --> 00:27:17,805
I promise I won’t get your drunk, okay?

389
00:27:22,005 --> 00:27:24,364
We are doing equation’s on the train.

390
00:27:24,678 --> 00:27:28,465
Alright, it’s not exactly risky business, but there’s always the ride back.

391
00:27:31,594 --> 00:27:32,619
Is this one mine?

392
00:27:32,715 --> 00:27:37,779
No. I… This girl I know missed a pop quiz in English Lit yesterday.

393
00:27:37,875 --> 00:27:39,598
Haley, you got an F?

394
00:27:39,699 --> 00:27:42,336
Mr. Kelly said I could make it up. It’s no big deal.

395
00:27:43,872 --> 00:27:47,011
It’s shocking, I’m human, I know. Let’s go.

396
00:27:56,802 --> 00:28:01,121
Hey, check this out. New web cam with 2 way voice capability.

397
00:28:01,474 --> 00:28:04,352
Sweet, huh? No more hunt and peck.

398
00:28:04,424 --> 00:28:07,798
That’s great. Daddy, I just…

399
00:28:07,987 --> 00:28:13,199
Hey, and since I missed your last birthday, I got a little surprise for you.

400
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:18,738
You’ve been yammering about working with oils.

401
00:28:20,281 --> 00:28:23,824
Wow, um, these are way too expensive.

402
00:28:23,921 --> 00:28:26,041
Not anymore, thanks to Global Dredging.

403
00:28:26,824 --> 00:28:29,789
- So, you already took the job?
- Yep, made the call this morning.

404
00:28:30,987 --> 00:28:32,932
Well, congratulations.

405
00:28:33,086 --> 00:28:36,578
Yeah, yeah, well you and I are going to go out and celebrate, what do you say?

406
00:28:36,722 --> 00:28:40,018
- Okay.
- Let me go change. I’ll be quick.

407
00:28:46,152 --> 00:28:50,427
You know, sometimes we hold back to spare each other’s feelings, and our own.

408
00:28:50,801 --> 00:28:53,263
So maybe it’s good that we have a session without Nathan.

409
00:28:53,428 --> 00:28:55,461
Holding back hasn’t been our problem.

410
00:28:55,696 --> 00:28:57,702
- How is he doing?
- He’s out of control.

411
00:28:57,797 --> 00:29:00,222
- He’s skipping school. 
- Basketball practice.

412
00:29:00,315 --> 00:29:01,832
Yesterday we caught him drinking.

413
00:29:02,461 --> 00:29:04,110
Sounds like he wants your attention.

414
00:29:04,191 --> 00:29:07,802
He was a good kid before. Worked hard. Kept busy with sports.

415
00:29:07,867 --> 00:29:10,186
He needs to find himself outside of sports.

416
00:29:10,259 --> 00:29:12,398
Right, take away the one sure thing the kids got.

417
00:29:13,929 --> 00:29:15,420
Tell me about basketball, Dan.

418
00:29:15,527 --> 00:29:17,605
Uh, you put a ball through a hoop.

419
00:29:18,317 --> 00:29:22,245
- What do you think Nathan gets out of it?
- He gets structure and discipline.

420
00:29:22,766 --> 00:29:24,866
And he gets to know that he’s the best at something.

421
00:29:24,974 --> 00:29:29,775
And also, you can relive your past and feel good about yourself.

422
00:29:29,853 --> 00:29:31,697
Okay, time out.

423
00:29:31,809 --> 00:29:35,019
Um, lets talk about the two of you for a minute.

424
00:29:35,101 --> 00:29:38,183
I mean outside of Nathan, let’s explore what makes you work as a couple.

425
00:29:38,362 --> 00:29:40,287
I mean, who are Deb and Dan Scott?

426
00:29:48,168 --> 00:29:52,797
Well, you’re late, practice was over about 5 hours ago.

427
00:29:54,639 --> 00:29:56,195
I drove past and saw your car.

428
00:29:57,691 --> 00:29:58,715
Don’t you ever go home?

429
00:30:01,193 --> 00:30:03,743
Sometimes I think this is my home.

430
00:30:06,258 --> 00:30:09,451
Well, is this a hit and run or a sit down?

431
00:30:10,706 --> 00:30:11,852
Sit down I guess.

432
00:30:13,154 --> 00:30:13,783
Good.

433
00:30:20,902 --> 00:30:22,605
I don’t know what I’m going to do, Coach.

434
00:30:26,097 --> 00:30:31,503
Nathan, nobody can make you do anything you don’t really want to.

435
00:30:31,939 --> 00:30:33,332
By nobody you mean my dad.

436
00:30:35,370 --> 00:30:36,845
Let me ask you a question.

437
00:30:38,282 --> 00:30:41,370
- Let’s take your father out of the picture.
- I wish.

438
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:46,859
Let’s take out all the pushing, the pressure,

439
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:50,940
the training that you’ve got to do to be as good as you are.

440
00:30:52,234 --> 00:30:54,718
Now ask yourself one simple question.

441
00:30:56,167 --> 00:30:58,215
Do you really love this game?

442
00:31:02,869 --> 00:31:03,760
I do.

443
00:31:07,482 --> 00:31:09,254
I just hate what it’s doing to my life.

444
00:31:11,316 --> 00:31:13,482
Then you may have found your answer.

445
00:31:28,921 --> 00:31:30,015
You wanna know what I think?

446
00:31:30,747 --> 00:31:31,982
I’m sure you’ll tell me.

447
00:31:32,161 --> 00:31:34,521
I think he’s trying to have the best of both worlds.

448
00:31:34,656 --> 00:31:35,674
Who? Lucas?

449
00:31:36,703 --> 00:31:43,204
He uses you for some sort of intellectual slash emotional thing, and me he just uses.

450
00:31:43,265 --> 00:31:44,731
Come on, you know he’s not like that.

451
00:31:44,812 --> 00:31:46,143
He’s a guy, Peyton.

452
00:31:46,619 --> 00:31:48,780
I mean, follow the nature trail and they’re all the same.

453
00:31:48,847 --> 00:31:52,304
Brooke, you could have any guy that you want and now you’ve got Lucas,

454
00:31:52,365 --> 00:31:54,941
okay, so can you please just sit back and enjoy it?

455
00:31:55,058 --> 00:31:58,335
He likes you! I like you, okay?

456
00:31:58,628 --> 00:32:01,192
So trust him, trust me,

457
00:32:02,161 --> 00:32:03,803
maybe try trusting yourself, okay?

458
00:32:45,003 --> 00:32:46,110
Doorbell broken?

459
00:32:47,759 --> 00:32:48,854
She never hears it.

460
00:32:49,835 --> 00:32:50,984
She always has her music on.

461
00:32:53,232 --> 00:32:55,992
I tell myself I’m doing what’s best for my daughter.

462
00:32:57,416 --> 00:32:59,228
That she should have whatever she wants.

463
00:33:00,170 --> 00:33:01,941
What I think she wants is you.

464
00:33:05,095 --> 00:33:06,534
Did you see her comic strip today?

465
00:33:08,326 --> 00:33:09,366
What strip?

466
00:33:12,642 --> 00:33:16,892
It’s supposed to be anonymous. Our secret, okay?

467
00:33:20,538 --> 00:33:21,332
Yeah.

468
00:33:29,435 --> 00:33:30,557
Hey Haley, you got a sec?

469
00:33:30,766 --> 00:33:32,201
Hey, you planning our next road trip?

470
00:33:32,651 --> 00:33:34,330
Actually, I thought we could just talk.

471
00:33:34,629 --> 00:33:36,414
Oh yeah, sure, what’s up?

472
00:33:37,669 --> 00:33:38,980
Well, look.

473
00:33:40,507 --> 00:33:42,764
Haley, I’ve had a lot of fun with you lately.

474
00:33:43,536 --> 00:33:48,006
But, I’m trying to apologize. For dragging you out of class the last couple of days.

475
00:33:48,074 --> 00:33:49,671
Oh Nathan, I had fun.

476
00:33:49,808 --> 00:33:51,554
And you got an F on your exam.

477
00:33:53,515 --> 00:33:57,919
Well, so what? You know, I make my own choices and I choose to be with you.

478
00:33:58,006 --> 00:33:58,922
That’s the thing.

479
00:34:00,085 --> 00:34:03,617
Look, I like to be with you too, but the real Haley,

480
00:34:04,662 --> 00:34:09,387
the one that I got all crushed out on, you know? I don’t want to see you change.

481
00:34:10,191 --> 00:34:11,047
I like you.

482
00:34:13,116 --> 00:34:16,325
And I like the fact that somebody like you sees something in me.

483
00:34:18,015 --> 00:34:19,757
Somebody like me or me?

484
00:34:20,288 --> 00:34:21,712
You already know the answer to that.

485
00:34:30,459 --> 00:34:31,440
You waiting for me?

486
00:34:34,301 --> 00:34:36,237
Actually, I’m just hanging out with your dad.

487
00:34:36,401 --> 00:34:37,216
Oh God, help me.

488
00:34:38,853 --> 00:34:43,231
Listen, you should probably talk to Brooke, she’s convinced she’s not being a good enough girlfriend.

489
00:34:46,158 --> 00:34:48,961
Oops, am I interrupting?

490
00:34:49,846 --> 00:34:50,994
Actually, I was just gonna...

491
00:34:52,345 --> 00:34:53,773
Please tell me that’s laundry.

492
00:34:53,916 --> 00:34:58,012
My ride’s on the way. I’m headed out tonight.

493
00:34:58,683 --> 00:35:00,491
You said you were going to be here till Wednesday.

494
00:35:01,414 --> 00:35:04,213
That was before I turned down the job.

495
00:35:04,439 --> 00:35:05,094
What?

496
00:35:05,570 --> 00:35:07,899
They managed to find me a 3 week gig instead.

497
00:35:07,982 --> 00:35:12,319
Then after that, I’m only taking locals, so we can be a family again.

498
00:35:13,092 --> 00:35:14,653
Daddy, don’t joke with me

499
00:35:14,782 --> 00:35:15,831
It’s no joke, hunny.

500
00:35:20,107 --> 00:35:25,559
Peyton, I love what I do, but not nearly as much as I love you.

501
00:35:26,931 --> 00:35:30,162
You’ve been alone enough, no more.

502
00:35:31,933 --> 00:35:33,014
I love you, Daddy.

503
00:35:34,012 --> 00:35:34,887
You better.

504
00:35:36,686 --> 00:35:39,235
Just promise to keep talking to me, okay?

505
00:35:39,332 --> 00:35:42,542
- I want to know what’s going on inside that pretty head.
- Okay.

506
00:35:43,997 --> 00:35:47,089
- Mr. Sawyer, your ride’s here.
- Oh, I gotta go.

507
00:35:47,186 --> 00:35:47,790
Okay.

508
00:35:48,441 --> 00:35:51,651
Lucas, you keep an eye on this one for me, alright?

509
00:35:52,265 --> 00:35:53,038
I will.

510
00:35:56,851 --> 00:35:58,522
I’ll leave the light on for you.

511
00:36:03,008 --> 00:36:06,955
Oh and by the way, I like your comic strip.

512
00:36:20,953 --> 00:36:21,619
Hey.

513
00:36:22,115 --> 00:36:23,969
Keith said you were at Peyton’s, again.

514
00:36:25,975 --> 00:36:30,287
Actually I was with Peyton’s dad, if that makes any difference.

515
00:36:32,070 --> 00:36:32,811
Whatever.

516
00:36:34,224 --> 00:36:35,324
Luke, can we talk?

517
00:36:35,867 --> 00:36:36,472
Yeah.

518
00:36:37,373 --> 00:36:43,128
Okay, I’m not sure if we have a problem, or if I have a problem.

519
00:36:43,410 --> 00:36:44,275
What’s the problem?

520
00:36:45,267 --> 00:36:47,998
In a nutshell, you’re you and I’m me.

521
00:36:49,312 --> 00:36:53,496
Yeah but if I was you, you’d be dating yourself.

522
00:36:54,797 --> 00:37:00,833
What I mean is, I do what I do, and I like what I like, and that’s just who I am.

523
00:37:00,904 --> 00:37:01,622
I know,

524
00:37:02,624 --> 00:37:04,719
and that’s what I love about you.

525
00:37:04,846 --> 00:37:11,078
Okay, but the music that you listen to and the books that you read, I’m not into any of that stuff.

526
00:37:11,206 --> 00:37:12,461
And I never asked you to be.

527
00:37:14,093 --> 00:37:14,851
Okay?

528
00:37:17,303 --> 00:37:19,649
You know, I kind of enjoy the fact that we’re different.

529
00:37:21,037 --> 00:37:21,722
Okay.

530
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:24,339
I’m sorry.

531
00:37:29,629 --> 00:37:34,118
It’s just that you’re the first really great guy that I’ve ever dated

532
00:37:34,579 --> 00:37:43,995
and that really scares me because I never gave a rat’s ass before, okay?

533
00:37:44,631 --> 00:37:46,509
But I do now.

534
00:37:47,528 --> 00:37:53,528
That’s good, because I give a rats ass about you too.

535
00:38:13,002 --> 00:38:14,245
You’re mother know you’re here?

536
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:15,090
Yeah,

537
00:38:17,147 --> 00:38:19,389
she said it was cool as long as we didn’t kill each other.

538
00:38:22,632 --> 00:38:25,099
I’m sorry for all the crap I’ve been pulling lately, dad.

539
00:38:26,834 --> 00:38:27,716
I figured.

540
00:38:30,122 --> 00:38:30,986
Everything okay?

541
00:38:31,422 --> 00:38:32,242
Not so good.

542
00:38:32,973 --> 00:38:34,345
Well, you’ll bounce back.

543
00:38:37,673 --> 00:38:39,398
Dad, how did we get so screwed up?

544
00:38:40,408 --> 00:38:41,605
We’ll get through this, Nate.

545
00:38:42,281 --> 00:38:43,034
How?

546
00:38:44,540 --> 00:38:46,512
Everything’s basketball with us, Dad.

547
00:38:48,349 --> 00:38:51,365
And now you’re yelling at me, and mom...

548
00:38:51,897 --> 00:38:53,392
Mom’s yelling back at you.

549
00:38:55,308 --> 00:38:59,229
I’m starting to wonder, is this all because of me?

550
00:38:59,316 --> 00:38:59,921
Nathan…

551
00:39:00,232 --> 00:39:01,272
I mean, Dad, look...

552
00:39:04,709 --> 00:39:07,723
I know you’re upset with me missing practice and everything,

553
00:39:08,443 --> 00:39:11,830
but I’m just not sure if I’ll ever be the player you were.

554
00:39:13,294 --> 00:39:14,938
I’m starting to think maybe...

555
00:39:17,867 --> 00:39:19,582
maybe you chose the wrong son.

556
00:39:20,216 --> 00:39:26,807
Nathan, you have to know, whatever you do, whatever you decide...

557
00:39:27,712 --> 00:39:29,996
you’re my son, and I am proud of you.

558
00:39:36,030 --> 00:39:37,727
I love you.

559
00:40:07,841 --> 00:40:08,601
Hey.

560
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:13,502
I was looking for you.

561
00:40:16,657 --> 00:40:20,464
I’m done. Just thought you should be the first to know.

562
00:40:21,191 --> 00:40:21,816
Me?

563
00:40:22,149 --> 00:40:24,699
Yeah, you wanted my world man,

564
00:40:27,282 --> 00:40:28,256
it’s all yours.

565
00:41:31,694 --> 00:41:33,599
“And the little prince said to the man”

566
00:41:35,422 --> 00:41:37,736
“Grownups never understand anything for themselves,

567
00:41:39,134 --> 00:41:43,502
and it is tiresome for children to be always explaining things to them“

568
