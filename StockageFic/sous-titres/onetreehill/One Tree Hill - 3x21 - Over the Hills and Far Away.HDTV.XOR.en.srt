1
00:00:00,426 --> 00:00:02,017
Previously on "One Tree Hill"...

2
00:00:02,018 --> 00:00:05,339
Haley, marry me again in front of our all friends and our family.

3
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:08,860
It's hurt me to see what's happened with your relationship with Dan.

4
00:00:08,861 --> 00:00:11,485
Uncle Cooper, what are you doing here, man?

5
00:00:11,486 --> 00:00:13,283
I met this smoking-hot girl.

6
00:00:13,284 --> 00:00:14,968
- I'm 17.
- You got to go.

7
00:00:14,969 --> 00:00:16,912
You know you still want me, Cooper.

8
00:00:21,610 --> 00:00:23,149
The guy shot up a school.

9
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:25,192
Yo, Marcus, would you shut up, man?

10
00:00:25,197 --> 00:00:26,773
I hope they fry his ass.

11
00:00:28,112 --> 00:00:32,236
Promise me that when you pick the boy you're really gonna be with

12
00:00:32,237 --> 00:00:34,116
that he'll be someone who you love.

13
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:37,022
Use your head and follow your heart.

14
00:01:23,405 --> 00:01:25,651
"Once upon a time, there was a beautiful princess

15
00:01:25,668 --> 00:01:28,042
who lived in a kingdom far, far away.

16
00:01:28,045 --> 00:01:30,572
And in that kingdom, there also lived a boy,

17
00:01:30,575 --> 00:01:32,811
and the princess loved that boy."

18
00:01:36,027 --> 00:01:37,360
Unbelievable.

19
00:01:41,996 --> 00:01:43,871
"And so the two decided to marry."

20
00:01:55,025 --> 00:01:56,882
Did you just say you wanted to get married?

21
00:01:56,888 --> 00:01:59,752
Yeah. Crazy, right?

22
00:02:00,237 --> 00:02:03,491
- It's a little nuts, yeah.
- Okay, but maybe not.

23
00:02:03,908 --> 00:02:06,652
It worked for Nathan and Haley. Look how happy they are.

24
00:02:06,657 --> 00:02:08,373
Brooke, let me in!

25
00:02:08,827 --> 00:02:10,632
No, it's not ready. Go away.

26
00:02:10,637 --> 00:02:15,181
It's my apartment, and it's my wedding dress, for that matter.

27
00:02:15,197 --> 00:02:19,902
No, it will be. But for now, it is my wedding dress, and it is not ready.

28
00:02:19,917 --> 00:02:22,912
Does it look like my dream dress, Vera Wang meets Snow White?

29
00:02:22,915 --> 00:02:24,031
It's better.

30
00:02:24,167 --> 00:02:25,072
Yay.

31
00:02:25,267 --> 00:02:27,052
This is so exciting.

32
00:02:27,347 --> 00:02:31,693
So, how did Nathan ask you to marry him the first time?

33
00:02:31,697 --> 00:02:37,841
Um, well, it was raining, and we just had that argument, the, um...

34
00:02:37,848 --> 00:02:39,083
one that I told you about.

35
00:02:39,085 --> 00:02:41,011
Oh, the one about the internet porn.

36
00:02:41,016 --> 00:02:43,053
Yes. Thank you for reminding me.

37
00:02:44,945 --> 00:02:48,572
Anyway, we made up in the rain,

38
00:02:48,576 --> 00:02:52,160
and we were laying in bed the next day, and, uh,

39
00:02:52,365 --> 00:02:54,792
he just looked over at me and said,

40
00:02:54,798 --> 00:02:56,393
"you're my family now."

41
00:02:56,398 --> 00:02:59,552
And he said that he could love me forever.

42
00:03:00,378 --> 00:03:02,300
Then he asked me to marry him.

43
00:03:03,536 --> 00:03:05,760
- That's so sweet.
- Yeah.

44
00:03:06,217 --> 00:03:09,533
But the dress still isn't ready, so you need to find something else to do with yourself. Chop-chop.

45
00:03:09,538 --> 00:03:12,223
You're such a grouch when Lucas isn't around.

46
00:03:12,228 --> 00:03:13,702
How long until he gets back?

47
00:03:13,708 --> 00:03:16,672
A couple of hours. Just in time for your rehearsal party,

48
00:03:16,685 --> 00:03:18,651
which, like your dress, is a total surprise.

49
00:03:18,657 --> 00:03:20,012
I hate surprises.

50
00:03:20,015 --> 00:03:22,520
Not these you won't. I promise.

51
00:03:23,168 --> 00:03:24,420
Get out of here.

52
00:03:32,066 --> 00:03:33,231
Hi.

53
00:03:33,655 --> 00:03:34,551
Oh, hi.

54
00:03:34,556 --> 00:03:35,490
You're Deb, right?

55
00:03:35,495 --> 00:03:36,781
Yeah.

56
00:03:37,367 --> 00:03:40,662
I was wondering if you could tell me how to get in touch with Cooper. I'm--

57
00:03:40,666 --> 00:03:44,652
No, I'm sorry. He's out of town. Can I give him a message?

58
00:03:45,418 --> 00:03:48,333
Just tell him his girlfriend stopped by.

59
00:03:49,167 --> 00:03:50,251
Rachel...

60
00:03:52,267 --> 00:03:55,092
Look, um, I know you've called the house,

61
00:03:55,096 --> 00:03:57,852
and I'm sure you've tried his cell, but...

62
00:03:57,856 --> 00:04:00,992
I think you know this is not going to work out.

63
00:04:02,218 --> 00:04:04,863
Well, maybe I'll just wait and hear that from him.

64
00:04:04,867 --> 00:04:07,251
You're not going to, okay?

65
00:04:07,426 --> 00:04:12,480
And I know that must hurt, but you're in high school, and he's nearly 30.

66
00:04:12,797 --> 00:04:15,441
What's next? He takes you to the prom?

67
00:04:15,917 --> 00:04:19,842
If you thought this could work, you wouldn't have lied in the first place.

68
00:04:22,256 --> 00:04:27,851
Did he tell you that he slept with me after he knew how old I was?

69
00:04:29,216 --> 00:04:30,860
Yes, he did.

70
00:04:33,036 --> 00:04:36,983
He also told me that it was a terrible mistake...

71
00:04:38,158 --> 00:04:40,081
...one he regrets.

72
00:04:41,656 --> 00:04:43,501
Just tell him I stopped by.

73
00:04:49,197 --> 00:04:50,491
Okay, this is weird.

74
00:04:50,496 --> 00:04:53,191
Normally it's the groom that can't see the dress before the wedding, not the bride.

75
00:04:53,195 --> 00:04:54,573
Quit whining. Are you ready?

76
00:04:54,576 --> 00:04:55,743
Yes, please!

77
00:04:55,746 --> 00:04:59,530
All right, Haley James Scott, I now pronounce you...

78
00:04:59,655 --> 00:05:01,072
fabulous.

79
00:05:02,477 --> 00:05:03,930
Do you love it?

80
00:05:04,625 --> 00:05:06,402
You're speechless!

81
00:05:06,407 --> 00:05:09,222
I knew you would be. Hold on. There's one more thing.

82
00:05:09,725 --> 00:05:11,670
Do you get it -- halo?

83
00:05:12,295 --> 00:05:16,062
Wow, wow. Brooke, this is, um...

84
00:05:16,068 --> 00:05:17,443
You're  welcome.

85
00:05:17,446 --> 00:05:21,782
Thank you so much for asking me to be your maid of honor. I love weddings.

86
00:05:22,446 --> 00:05:25,743
"Now, in this kingdom, all was not well."

87
00:05:27,076 --> 00:05:28,893
I love you, Jake.

88
00:05:29,027 --> 00:05:30,481
I do.

89
00:05:30,485 --> 00:05:33,022
And you know that I love Jenny.

90
00:05:33,037 --> 00:05:35,252
So maybe that's enough.

91
00:05:35,878 --> 00:05:38,733
I think only in fairy tales that's enough, Peyton.

92
00:05:39,288 --> 00:05:40,662
You know what?

93
00:05:40,986 --> 00:05:45,361
Someone told me once that there's nothing wrong with fairy tales.

94
00:05:45,368 --> 00:05:47,770
Everybody lives happily ever after.

95
00:05:49,676 --> 00:05:51,470
Okay, listen to me.

96
00:05:51,477 --> 00:05:56,121
You can't just fly into Savannah and then get in my head all over again,

97
00:05:56,128 --> 00:05:59,473
tell me you want to stay, and then ask me to marry you.

98
00:05:59,476 --> 00:06:01,983
- Why not?
- Because...

99
00:06:03,665 --> 00:06:05,562
I might just say, "yes."

100
00:06:19,147 --> 00:06:21,862
"So the princess and the boy were set to be wed.

101
00:06:21,867 --> 00:06:25,750
And because she was a princess, the call went out for a beautiful gown."

102
00:06:32,945 --> 00:06:33,983
Whoa.

103
00:06:33,985 --> 00:06:36,261
Sorry, I'm not supposed to see you in your wedding dress, right?

104
00:06:36,267 --> 00:06:38,481
It's okay. This is not my wedding dress.

105
00:06:39,445 --> 00:06:40,122
It's not?

106
00:06:40,126 --> 00:06:44,103
No, it's supposed to be, but there is no way that I am getting married in this frock.

107
00:06:44,105 --> 00:06:46,403
I asked Brooke to make me something simple and elegant,

108
00:06:46,407 --> 00:06:49,202
and, instead, she makes me something that's so...

109
00:06:49,326 --> 00:06:50,241
Brooke!

110
00:06:50,256 --> 00:06:52,623
Maybe you should wear it, anyway.

111
00:06:52,716 --> 00:06:55,893
Brooke's your maid of honor, and you did ask her to make the dress, right?

112
00:06:55,897 --> 00:06:56,663
So?

113
00:06:56,667 --> 00:06:59,193
So she'd be crushed if you didn't wear it.

114
00:07:01,488 --> 00:07:04,343
Anyway, it doesn't matter what you wear.

115
00:07:04,348 --> 00:07:05,983
My girl's gonna look beautiful...

116
00:07:06,528 --> 00:07:07,950
Thank you.

117
00:07:08,636 --> 00:07:11,620
- Except maybe in this thing.
- Oh, shut up!

118
00:07:16,416 --> 00:07:17,583
Hello?

119
00:07:17,698 --> 00:07:19,710
Oh, okay.

120
00:07:19,818 --> 00:07:22,153
Yeah, I know where it is. All right. I'll be there.

121
00:07:22,157 --> 00:07:23,362
All right, bye.

122
00:07:23,578 --> 00:07:25,741
Peyton's car broke down. You want to come with me?

123
00:07:25,745 --> 00:07:28,992
Um... yeah, actually. Let me just go change.

124
00:07:29,136 --> 00:07:32,923
You  can drop me at the cafe. I'm gonna need money for a new wedding dress.

125
00:07:40,135 --> 00:07:41,982
What's on your mind, kiddo?

126
00:07:44,005 --> 00:07:45,202
B rooke.

127
00:07:45,338 --> 00:07:50,443
You know, it was nice to get away, but I'm glad we're gonna be home soon.

128
00:07:50,866 --> 00:07:53,082
Did you like any of the colleges we looked at?

129
00:07:53,335 --> 00:07:58,692
Yeah, but, you know, I figure I'll just go to somewhere we can afford.

130
00:07:58,708 --> 00:08:02,961
I mean, thanks to my heart condition, I won't be getting a basketball scholarship.

131
00:08:04,786 --> 00:08:08,021
You know, this trip wasn't just about finding you a school.

132
00:08:08,028 --> 00:08:09,951
It was also about finding a way back.

133
00:08:09,956 --> 00:08:11,160
To what?

134
00:08:11,168 --> 00:08:13,790
To a place where it's okay to dream again.

135
00:08:16,157 --> 00:08:19,891
You walked away from basketball so that you could live a long life.

136
00:08:19,898 --> 00:08:22,002
What are you gonna do with that life?

137
00:08:23,968 --> 00:08:25,993
What's your next dream, Lucas?

138
00:08:36,885 --> 00:08:38,102
Hey.

139
00:08:38,507 --> 00:08:39,502
Sorry about this.

140
00:08:39,505 --> 00:08:41,142
No problem. What did it do -- overheat?

141
00:08:41,147 --> 00:08:43,833
Yeah. I'm not really sure why, though.

142
00:08:45,738 --> 00:08:47,451
So, how's your leg doing?

143
00:08:48,536 --> 00:08:51,841
Oh, um... it's okay.

144
00:08:51,962 --> 00:08:54,406
It's just kind of weird everybody knowing about it.

145
00:08:56,337 --> 00:08:58,816
I was in the tutor center that day.

146
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:06,992
Well, I guess you know my friend Haley then?

147
00:09:06,997 --> 00:09:08,250
Not really.

148
00:09:08,476 --> 00:09:10,562
But I think that was kind of the point.

149
00:09:14,397 --> 00:09:16,530
You got a hole in your radiator.

150
00:09:16,685 --> 00:09:19,552
I'm gonna have to tow you in. I can drop you off somewhere if you want.

151
00:09:19,558 --> 00:09:22,592
No, it's okay. I called someone.

152
00:09:26,365 --> 00:09:28,560
Hey, you okay?

153
00:09:30,148 --> 00:09:32,583
- How's it going, Nate?
- Hey, Marcus.

154
00:09:32,615 --> 00:09:34,422
So, I guess you guys have met.

155
00:09:34,438 --> 00:09:35,601
Yeah.

156
00:09:35,605 --> 00:09:36,923
How you been?

157
00:09:37,257 --> 00:09:38,723
Could be better.

158
00:09:39,128 --> 00:09:40,430
You mind giving me a hand?

159
00:09:40,437 --> 00:09:41,571
Sure.

160
00:09:41,645 --> 00:09:43,542
I'm gonna go clear my head.

161
00:09:43,758 --> 00:09:44,761
Okay.

162
00:09:51,546 --> 00:09:53,903
So, uh, I haven't seen you around much.

163
00:09:53,908 --> 00:09:56,291
It's 'cause you don't hang out with any cool people.

164
00:10:04,088 --> 00:10:05,221
Good.

165
00:10:09,447 --> 00:10:13,942
Nah, the truth is, that day in the tutor center kind of screwed me up.

166
00:10:13,946 --> 00:10:17,582
Yeah, I think it kind of screwed all of us up, man.

167
00:10:17,588 --> 00:10:21,010
Yeah, I guess, but...

168
00:10:21,736 --> 00:10:23,433
I just made it worse.

169
00:10:25,475 --> 00:10:28,722
Sometimes I wish I could talk to the kid in that room and try to help him.

170
00:10:28,728 --> 00:10:30,131
Edwards, you mean?

171
00:10:31,165 --> 00:10:32,583
And me too...

172
00:10:33,055 --> 00:10:34,683
the me I was then.

173
00:10:38,208 --> 00:10:40,203
So, you're working a part-time job now, huh?

174
00:10:40,205 --> 00:10:42,293
No, full-time.

175
00:10:42,298 --> 00:10:43,690
You dropped out of school?

176
00:10:43,696 --> 00:10:44,932
Yeah.

177
00:10:46,367 --> 00:10:48,590
It was hard walking past that room,

178
00:10:48,838 --> 00:10:50,702
so I just quit going.

179
00:10:51,128 --> 00:10:52,972
Thought it might help, but...

180
00:10:54,107 --> 00:10:56,631
I guess we're all gonna have that day with us forever.

181
00:11:03,148 --> 00:11:04,971
You know I love you, Sawyer, but, uh,

182
00:11:04,975 --> 00:11:07,471
isn't this the kind of thing you usually call Lucas for?

183
00:11:07,906 --> 00:11:09,331
He's out of town.

184
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:10,663
What about Brooke?

185
00:11:16,765 --> 00:11:18,452
Jake, you okay?

186
00:11:19,825 --> 00:11:21,742
You know you talk in your sleep?

187
00:11:21,746 --> 00:11:24,303
Uh, yeah, I'm sorry.

188
00:11:27,178 --> 00:11:30,743
I've been sitting awake, wrestling with the feeling that...

189
00:11:32,518 --> 00:11:34,553
you need to go back to Tree Hill.

190
00:11:34,795 --> 00:11:36,573
You shouldn't stay here.

191
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:40,163
You can't.

192
00:11:40,257 --> 00:11:42,192
Why? What happened?

193
00:11:45,287 --> 00:11:47,162
You talk in your sleep, Peyton.

194
00:11:47,168 --> 00:11:49,350
Okay, so -- so what? I don't -- I don't understand.

195
00:11:49,358 --> 00:11:52,092
So, what, I mumble a few words in my sleep?

196
00:11:52,108 --> 00:11:54,902
I mean, what did I say? Was it really that bad?

197
00:11:54,908 --> 00:11:56,442
Did I say I wanted to kill you or something?

198
00:11:56,447 --> 00:11:57,592
No.

199
00:11:57,646 --> 00:11:59,120
You said, "I love you."

200
00:12:00,228 --> 00:12:02,711
Okay, well, normally, that's a good thing.

201
00:12:02,715 --> 00:12:04,742
You said, "I love you, Lucas."

202
00:12:11,696 --> 00:12:13,543
Now, as the wedding day approached,

203
00:12:13,557 --> 00:12:16,001
the princess worried about the evil king.

204
00:12:16,008 --> 00:12:18,592
Because, although he had not always been this way,

205
00:12:18,595 --> 00:12:23,341
his heart had turn dark and his kingdom had grown to fear and despise him.

206
00:12:29,906 --> 00:12:33,501
Okay, Mr. Scott you gotta go home because you've been out here all morning,

207
00:12:33,515 --> 00:12:35,331
and you're kinda creeping some of the customers out,

208
00:12:35,338 --> 00:12:37,062
and Deb's not working today, okay?

209
00:12:37,066 --> 00:12:39,473
How's Nathan doing ? I mean since he lost Keith ?

210
00:12:39,476 --> 00:12:43,822
He's a mess, especially since he lost his father long before that.

211
00:12:45,565 --> 00:12:46,753
Haley.

212
00:12:47,888 --> 00:12:50,690
I hear the two of you plan on renewing your vows.

213
00:12:50,736 --> 00:12:52,321
I'm happy for you.

214
00:12:52,737 --> 00:12:55,823
You're the best thing that's happened in his life in a long time.

215
00:12:55,948 --> 00:12:58,101
Would you tell him I send my best?

216
00:12:58,106 --> 00:13:01,330
I understand he wants to keep his distance with this restraining order. I respect that.

217
00:13:01,337 --> 00:13:04,842
Mr. Scott, I'm not buying it...

218
00:13:04,848 --> 00:13:06,263
This...

219
00:13:06,887 --> 00:13:08,040
You.

220
00:13:10,495 --> 00:13:12,653
I guess I can respect that, too.

221
00:13:14,127 --> 00:13:16,612
I'm glad that you're protective over him, Haley.

222
00:13:17,508 --> 00:13:20,952
I suppose if he reaches his potential, it doesn't matter who got him there,

223
00:13:20,957 --> 00:13:22,290
you or me.

224
00:13:23,566 --> 00:13:26,152
It's just that he gets there that's important.

225
00:13:27,438 --> 00:13:29,393
Have a nice wedding day.

226
00:13:33,066 --> 00:13:35,363
Hey, this is Cooper. You know the drill.

227
00:13:35,528 --> 00:13:40,643
Hey, Cooper. I was just thinking about you and thought I'd try you again.

228
00:13:40,695 --> 00:13:42,500
Give me a call, okay?

229
00:13:42,977 --> 00:13:45,980
It's kind of starting to feel like you're trying to avoid me.

230
00:13:46,296 --> 00:13:48,221
Okay, bye.

231
00:13:58,476 --> 00:14:03,011
Hey, buddy. Okay, I know I said I was done with the dress, but I came up with a fantastic idea.

232
00:14:03,015 --> 00:14:06,020
It involves feathers but tasteful feathers, so don't freak out.

233
00:14:06,028 --> 00:14:09,601
Okay, um... I-I need to talk to you about the dress.

234
00:14:09,608 --> 00:14:10,311
Okay.

235
00:14:10,317 --> 00:14:14,500
I know that you've worked really hard on this, and I just love you for it.

236
00:14:14,508 --> 00:14:17,811
Um, I just don't know if it's me.

237
00:14:19,155 --> 00:14:20,133
You don't like it?

238
00:14:20,136 --> 00:14:23,251
No, it's not that I don't like it. It's just a little...

239
00:14:23,678 --> 00:14:26,661
Maybe we can just take it down a little, you know?

240
00:14:26,666 --> 00:14:28,131
I worked really hard on this.

241
00:14:28,138 --> 00:14:30,520
- I know you did, like I said --
- And you hate it.

242
00:14:30,528 --> 00:14:33,460
I don't hate it. I just want something simple.

243
00:14:33,468 --> 00:14:34,703
This is simple.

244
00:14:34,705 --> 00:14:37,602
Brooke, you're -- you're putting feathers on it.

245
00:14:39,445 --> 00:14:40,600
Fine.

246
00:14:41,548 --> 00:14:46,543
You know what? Why don't you wear that stupid hat and poncho of yours for all I care?

247
00:14:46,545 --> 00:14:48,281
Brooke, there's no need to get nasty.

248
00:14:48,285 --> 00:14:51,651
No? You can insult my fashion sense, but I can't insult yours?

249
00:14:51,656 --> 00:14:54,223
Brooke, all I'm saying is I want something closer to the picture.

250
00:14:54,227 --> 00:14:55,300
Right, closer to the picture.

251
00:14:55,306 --> 00:14:59,732
Okay, so if you want to go shopping and buy a new wedding dress, why don't you go to Slut Barn?

252
00:14:59,888 --> 00:15:01,701
I'm sure they're having a sale.

253
00:15:02,027 --> 00:15:04,392
Oh. Well, you would know, wouldn't you?

254
00:15:27,808 --> 00:15:30,061
You told Lucas that you loved him?

255
00:15:33,006 --> 00:15:35,830
It was the school shooting, okay, and I was bleeding.

256
00:15:35,835 --> 00:15:39,470
And I thought I was gonna die. I didn't mean it like that!

257
00:15:40,485 --> 00:15:43,130
Jake, I love you.

258
00:15:43,138 --> 00:15:44,342
I know that you do.

259
00:15:44,348 --> 00:15:47,202
Well, then why are you making such a big deal about this?

260
00:15:47,216 --> 00:15:49,581
When you decided that you weren't gonna go back to Tree hill,

261
00:15:49,585 --> 00:15:51,051
do you remember what you told me?

262
00:15:51,056 --> 00:15:51,833
Yeah.

263
00:15:51,836 --> 00:15:53,822
You said that your father's not around,

264
00:15:53,826 --> 00:15:55,791
that Haley has Nathan,

265
00:15:55,798 --> 00:15:58,140
and that Brooke has Lucas.

266
00:15:58,147 --> 00:16:00,960
Okay, you know what? Haley and Brooke are my best friends,

267
00:16:00,968 --> 00:16:04,303
and they spend a lot of time with their boyfriends. That's all I meant by that.

268
00:16:04,318 --> 00:16:06,170
Let me ask you a question.

269
00:16:07,156 --> 00:16:09,412
What if Brooke didn't have Lucas?

270
00:16:18,528 --> 00:16:21,432
"In the days before the wedding, the king surprised the princess

271
00:16:21,435 --> 00:16:23,742
and gave his blessing to the marriage,

272
00:16:23,745 --> 00:16:26,062
but the princess was still torn

273
00:16:26,066 --> 00:16:28,503
for, even though she had found her true love,

274
00:16:28,507 --> 00:16:32,292
it meant she would have to leave her faithful handmaiden behind forever."

275
00:16:33,385 --> 00:16:35,730
Hi, only friend I can trust.

276
00:16:36,758 --> 00:16:38,743
Whoa,  what's wrong?

277
00:16:39,255 --> 00:16:40,620
Did you break up with Pete?

278
00:16:40,638 --> 00:16:42,742
I didn't go to see Pete.

279
00:16:43,466 --> 00:16:46,541
When I left this weekend, I went to go see Jake.

280
00:16:47,355 --> 00:16:50,111
Oh... my... god.

281
00:16:51,276 --> 00:16:53,511
But that's a good thing, right?

282
00:16:54,468 --> 00:16:55,913
Don't you see, Peyton?

283
00:16:55,916 --> 00:16:59,780
You asked me to marry you after Jenny called you mama...

284
00:16:59,787 --> 00:17:00,900
Yeah.

285
00:17:00,906 --> 00:17:03,283
After you lost your mom again.

286
00:17:03,765 --> 00:17:06,082
- And your dad's not around.
- Oh, you know what? Don't.

287
00:17:06,085 --> 00:17:08,330
You're alone, Peyton. I get it.

288
00:17:09,006 --> 00:17:11,693
It makes all the sense in the world that you want a family.

289
00:17:11,695 --> 00:17:13,802
No, I want this family.

290
00:17:13,807 --> 00:17:14,532
Do you?

291
00:17:14,536 --> 00:17:17,303
Okay, you know what? Just don't...

292
00:17:18,996 --> 00:17:23,263
I don't understand this, okay? 'Cause it seems like you're working really hard to push me away.

293
00:17:23,266 --> 00:17:25,273
So if you're not into me, just say so.

294
00:17:25,277 --> 00:17:28,383
No, that is not it. I love you, Peyton, okay?

295
00:17:28,385 --> 00:17:31,041
I don't want to believe there's another guy in your heart,

296
00:17:31,045 --> 00:17:32,410
but I think that there is.

297
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:34,361
I think that you're afraid.

298
00:17:34,366 --> 00:17:36,841
Yeah,  you know what? I am afraid.

299
00:17:36,997 --> 00:17:40,112
It hurt like hell the last time I lost you, and I --

300
00:17:40,118 --> 00:17:42,631
I-I don't want to do that again.

301
00:17:43,158 --> 00:17:45,120
Then don't.

302
00:17:48,207 --> 00:17:49,320
L ook.

303
00:17:51,907 --> 00:17:56,551
Marriages fall apart all the time because people, they get caught up with the romance,

304
00:17:56,568 --> 00:17:58,520
and they're not honest with themselves.

305
00:17:58,525 --> 00:18:00,731
Well, I have to be twice as honest --

306
00:18:00,737 --> 00:18:03,342
once for me, once for Jenny.

307
00:18:14,216 --> 00:18:16,493
Whoa! Anyone I know?

308
00:18:16,997 --> 00:18:19,101
Mostly me. I talked to Brooke today.

309
00:18:19,105 --> 00:18:20,383
Oh, boy.

310
00:18:21,895 --> 00:18:28,572
I have never seen someone go from so thrilled to so hurt

311
00:18:28,575 --> 00:18:32,361
to really mean so quickly, and that was just me.

312
00:18:32,366 --> 00:18:33,772
I'm sorry, Hales.

313
00:18:34,078 --> 00:18:37,123
Well, hey. You'll never guess who I ran into today -- Marcus.

314
00:18:37,127 --> 00:18:38,630
Marcus-from-the-tutor-center Marcus?

315
00:18:38,638 --> 00:18:40,740
Yeah. You know he dropped out of school?

316
00:18:42,085 --> 00:18:45,480
I ran into Dan today. Who do you think is a bigger ass?

317
00:18:45,488 --> 00:18:48,341
Actually, he seemed like he was really affected by the whole thing,

318
00:18:48,346 --> 00:18:51,011
like maybe he was trying to change because of it.

319
00:18:51,715 --> 00:18:55,362
Actually, I was gonna say the same thing about Dan, believe it or not.

320
00:18:55,365 --> 00:18:56,681
Not.

321
00:18:57,117 --> 00:19:00,520
But I was thinking about inviting him to the wedding and to the dinner tonight.

322
00:19:00,538 --> 00:19:02,361
- Dan?!
- No -- Marcus.

323
00:19:02,366 --> 00:19:06,301
I mean, I'd love to include my dad, but I know he'd just screw it up.

324
00:19:06,477 --> 00:19:08,341
There's still hope for Marcus.

325
00:19:10,606 --> 00:19:14,143
Oh, and just a reminder. You still got to pick out our first-dance song.

326
00:19:14,146 --> 00:19:16,080
I know. I have it narrowed down to three.

327
00:19:16,087 --> 00:19:16,932
Oh, cool.

328
00:19:16,935 --> 00:19:20,690
I'll tell you what. Give me those songs, I'll surprise you on the day.

329
00:19:20,695 --> 00:19:22,642
- Okay, it sounds fun.
- All right.

330
00:19:22,646 --> 00:19:25,001
Now what are you going to do about Brooke?

331
00:19:25,085 --> 00:19:28,581
I mean, besides pretending that she's a speed bag and wailing on her?

332
00:19:29,945 --> 00:19:33,910
I am going to apologize and hope she forgives me.

333
00:19:33,918 --> 00:19:35,393
That's my girl.

334
00:19:40,575 --> 00:19:41,891
Literature.

335
00:19:42,336 --> 00:19:44,361
You asked me about my future.

336
00:19:44,366 --> 00:19:49,222
And if I could go to any college, it would be U.N.C. to study literature.

337
00:19:49,225 --> 00:19:52,221
My son, the next great american author.

338
00:19:52,418 --> 00:19:54,271
I don't know about that, ma.

339
00:19:54,926 --> 00:19:57,191
And U.N.C. would be your dream school?

340
00:19:57,196 --> 00:20:00,042
Yeah, sure, if we had the money.

341
00:20:03,036 --> 00:20:04,781
Okay, listen to me.

342
00:20:05,596 --> 00:20:09,523
Before we left, the lawyer who drew up the adoption papers called.

343
00:20:10,736 --> 00:20:12,560
He told me that ever since you were born,

344
00:20:12,568 --> 00:20:15,793
Keith has been saving a fund for you for college.

345
00:20:15,796 --> 00:20:17,972
I didn't know about it myself.

346
00:20:20,388 --> 00:20:23,013
He dreamed your dream with you, Lucas.

347
00:20:24,587 --> 00:20:28,823
And if this is something that you really want, and you have the grades, then...

348
00:20:29,177 --> 00:20:30,742
you can have it...

349
00:20:32,567 --> 00:20:34,721
because Keith left it for you.

350
00:20:41,637 --> 00:20:43,641
God, I miss him so much.

351
00:20:45,787 --> 00:20:47,693
He's always with you.

352
00:20:48,365 --> 00:20:49,711
Always.

353
00:20:52,275 --> 00:20:54,172
You make him proud.

354
00:20:55,908 --> 00:20:57,291
I will.

355
00:21:00,786 --> 00:21:03,363
I totally lost my mind and went off on Haley.

356
00:21:03,376 --> 00:21:05,411
- I called her a slut.
- Ow.

357
00:21:05,885 --> 00:21:07,620
You know what? I'm proud of you, B. Davis.

358
00:21:07,625 --> 00:21:09,381
Helping Haley find another dress is --

359
00:21:09,385 --> 00:21:11,032
Oh, no. We're not shopping for her.

360
00:21:11,038 --> 00:21:14,512
We're shopping because I feel miserable, and this is therapy.

361
00:21:14,515 --> 00:21:15,492
Brooke...

362
00:21:15,496 --> 00:21:18,310
Oh, see? All better. Be right back.

363
00:21:51,176 --> 00:21:52,441
Rachel?

364
00:21:52,696 --> 00:21:54,551
He said he liked me.

365
00:21:56,177 --> 00:21:58,122
I need him to like me.

366
00:22:01,767 --> 00:22:05,680
"On the eve of the princess' wedding, a lavish feast was arranged.

367
00:22:05,688 --> 00:22:08,331
Friends and royalty were summoned from lands far away

368
00:22:08,338 --> 00:22:12,121
to join the happy couple for a night of laughter and magic."

369
00:22:15,817 --> 00:22:20,103
Well, well. As usual, Brooke Davis shows up when all the work is done.

370
00:22:20,105 --> 00:22:23,662
Sorry, I had some things I had to deal with.

371
00:22:24,578 --> 00:22:28,332
Speaking of, you never told me how everything ended up with Jake.

372
00:22:28,677 --> 00:22:32,282
Uh, just not what I wanted it to be, um...

373
00:22:34,155 --> 00:22:36,200
I think I'm gonna go hide the knives.

374
00:22:38,578 --> 00:22:40,531
- Hey.
- Hey.

375
00:22:40,668 --> 00:22:42,022
Um...

376
00:22:43,877 --> 00:22:45,420
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.

377
00:22:49,108 --> 00:22:50,611
I'm sorry.

378
00:22:51,467 --> 00:22:53,941
I was being selfish, and I wasn't listening to you.

379
00:22:53,946 --> 00:22:58,983
I was so wrapped up in what I wanted that dress to be, that I freaked out a little bit.

380
00:22:59,445 --> 00:23:01,733
I would love to wear your dress.

381
00:23:02,507 --> 00:23:07,170
That's really nice, but I think you might want to save the love until after dinner tonight.

382
00:23:07,176 --> 00:23:11,080
You know all those questions I've been asking you about the early days of Naley?

383
00:23:11,087 --> 00:23:11,650
Yeah.

384
00:23:11,656 --> 00:23:14,143
You didn't think I really wanted to know all that, did you?

385
00:23:14,146 --> 00:23:15,012
Yes.

386
00:23:15,015 --> 00:23:17,640
No. I was just gathering material.

387
00:23:17,647 --> 00:23:18,981
See you tonight.

388
00:23:30,378 --> 00:23:31,981
It's really filling up out there.

389
00:23:31,985 --> 00:23:32,952
Really?

390
00:23:32,957 --> 00:23:34,453
Thank god. I was worried.

391
00:23:34,466 --> 00:23:38,000
Apparently, there's a flu going around, and everybody's dropping like flies.

392
00:23:38,555 --> 00:23:41,002
Lucas should be back any second.

393
00:23:41,008 --> 00:23:42,072
Are you excited?

394
00:23:42,077 --> 00:23:43,613
Yeah, I am.

395
00:23:43,836 --> 00:23:46,571
But I don't know. It's -- it's kind of strange.

396
00:23:46,577 --> 00:23:52,143
I realized since he's been gone that I'm not as dependent on him as I thought.

397
00:23:52,147 --> 00:23:57,201
You know, I have my clothing line, and I have my friends, and I have me,

398
00:23:57,208 --> 00:24:00,160
and I'm not such bad company.

399
00:24:00,465 --> 00:24:01,742
Who knew?

400
00:24:03,055 --> 00:24:05,661
Peyton. Naley's here.

401
00:24:06,188 --> 00:24:07,382
Okay.

402
00:24:12,608 --> 00:24:13,592
Brooke...

403
00:24:14,486 --> 00:24:16,033
you're the best company.

404
00:24:16,545 --> 00:24:17,871
Believe that.

405
00:24:47,348 --> 00:24:49,710
...a time, there was a girl and boy.

406
00:24:49,718 --> 00:24:55,200
No. Once upon a time, in a land far, far away, a girl and a boy...

407
00:24:55,925 --> 00:24:57,230
Hey, pretty girl.

408
00:24:57,527 --> 00:25:00,823
Hi, boyfriend. Oh, I missed you.

409
00:25:00,827 --> 00:25:01,983
I missed you.

410
00:25:02,705 --> 00:25:04,340
This place looks great.

411
00:25:04,748 --> 00:25:07,170
- You did good, Brooke.
- Yeah, I know I did.

412
00:25:07,178 --> 00:25:09,951
Peyton and some other people helped, but it was mostly me.

413
00:25:11,927 --> 00:25:13,300
Small problem.

414
00:25:13,938 --> 00:25:17,000
Skills is sick, and he's supposed to be in that first scene with me.

415
00:25:17,005 --> 00:25:19,233
Fergie said he'd stand in for him, but I don't think

416
00:25:19,236 --> 00:25:22,390
anybody's gonna buy him as Nathan 'cause, you know...

417
00:25:22,956 --> 00:25:24,271
...his hair.

418
00:25:26,985 --> 00:25:31,411
Um, you know what? I think it's gonna be fine. Just give him a set of lines.

419
00:25:31,416 --> 00:25:34,640
Lucas, here's yours. It's -- it's showtime.

420
00:25:47,645 --> 00:25:53,273
Once upon a time, in a kingdom far, far away, a girl and a boy fell in love.

421
00:25:54,065 --> 00:25:56,600
And then another girl, supposedly a friend,

422
00:25:56,608 --> 00:26:00,131
secretly taped how they fell in love and decided to use it against them.

423
00:26:04,508 --> 00:26:09,453
So tonight I give you an authentic and very unauthorized re-enactment

424
00:26:09,456 --> 00:26:12,141
of "Nathan and Haley, a fairy tale."

425
00:26:21,548 --> 00:26:24,431
Look at that blond girl! Look at her wig!

426
00:26:24,467 --> 00:26:26,223
Oh, my god.

427
00:26:30,468 --> 00:26:33,853
So you're Nathan Scott, Mr. big-shot basketball player.

428
00:26:33,855 --> 00:26:36,572
I don't trust you, and I'm totally not into you,

429
00:26:36,575 --> 00:26:40,260
and I'm just tutoring you so that you'll leave my best friend Lucas alone.

430
00:26:43,297 --> 00:26:47,820
Damn, baby. That is one ugly-ass poncho.

431
00:26:50,306 --> 00:26:51,691
Yo, check it out.

432
00:26:58,107 --> 00:27:00,562
Don't say I never gave you no bling.

433
00:27:20,718 --> 00:27:24,793
Listen, Nathan. I know you collapsed on the basketball court tonight,

434
00:27:24,795 --> 00:27:30,190
so I was thinking maybe you wanted to stay the night and get a little freaky.

435
00:27:34,035 --> 00:27:35,720
How about this?

436
00:27:40,458 --> 00:27:41,803
Okay.

437
00:27:42,437 --> 00:27:44,570
- This is not how it happened.
- Yes, it did.

438
00:27:44,575 --> 00:27:45,990
No! It's not!

439
00:27:55,115 --> 00:27:56,282
What's wrong, Haley?

440
00:27:56,285 --> 00:27:58,890
I just want to go home to my own room.

441
00:27:58,898 --> 00:28:00,913
I'm not a wife.

442
00:28:00,995 --> 00:28:03,683
I'm not even a senior.

443
00:28:05,965 --> 00:28:08,472
I'll always be there for you, Mrs. Scott --

444
00:28:08,478 --> 00:28:13,411
I mean, um, Haley -- always and forever.

445
00:28:20,458 --> 00:28:25,423
Um, it seems that there's a bit of a bug going around, and we've lost a few performers.

446
00:28:25,425 --> 00:28:29,563
So I was wondering if, in this next scene, Nathan wanted to play himself?

447
00:28:30,026 --> 00:28:33,170
What? No, no.

448
00:29:01,015 --> 00:29:03,783
You're gonna wake my parents. That's their room.

449
00:29:03,788 --> 00:29:05,882
Uh, look, Haley, I --

450
00:29:07,978 --> 00:29:09,633
That's not in the script.

451
00:29:11,705 --> 00:29:13,720
You missed a few lines!

452
00:29:14,306 --> 00:29:15,380
Gosh.

453
00:29:16,285 --> 00:29:17,730
I think I messed up.

454
00:29:17,737 --> 00:29:19,352
We better start over.

455
00:29:48,035 --> 00:29:53,410
I decided to go for a run, and I ended up here. Boy, is it raining out.

456
00:29:55,318 --> 00:29:57,250
I'm mad at you, Nathan Scott.

457
00:29:57,266 --> 00:29:59,042
Haley, please listen to me.

458
00:29:59,045 --> 00:30:01,933
I know I'm a... porn freak.

459
00:30:01,935 --> 00:30:03,010
Hey.

460
00:30:03,017 --> 00:30:04,591
Ha ha.

461
00:30:04,935 --> 00:30:08,291
Nathan, it's okay. I like my porn, too.

462
00:30:08,955 --> 00:30:11,981
And I Haley myself from time to time.

463
00:30:13,718 --> 00:30:17,722
But I still need to know if you love me.

464
00:30:19,465 --> 00:30:23,320
Someday, I'm gonna marry you, Haley James.

465
00:30:23,478 --> 00:30:24,931
Someday.

466
00:30:35,737 --> 00:30:37,310
Peyton, I'm sorry.

467
00:30:37,638 --> 00:30:39,413
I don't want you to go.

468
00:30:39,787 --> 00:30:43,342
But your father told you to follow your heart, and he's right.

469
00:30:44,146 --> 00:30:46,193
As much as it kills me to say it.

470
00:30:46,516 --> 00:30:48,670
I think you need to follow it home.

471
00:30:49,326 --> 00:30:51,322
But what if you're wrong?

472
00:30:52,066 --> 00:30:57,360
What if I go back and my heart just aches for you like it has for months now?

473
00:30:58,447 --> 00:31:00,440
Well, then I'll still be here.

474
00:31:01,425 --> 00:31:04,941
And if it's meant to be, we'll be together.

475
00:31:05,947 --> 00:31:07,542
Someday.

476
00:31:12,787 --> 00:31:15,811
"As the night wore on, a calm fell upon the land,

477
00:31:15,815 --> 00:31:17,720
and all was right in the world

478
00:31:17,725 --> 00:31:19,672
if only for a moment."

479
00:31:24,517 --> 00:31:28,142
Oh, my god. I would strangle you if this wasn't so awesome.

480
00:31:28,147 --> 00:31:32,092
Thank you, and thanks for being my maid of honor. It means a lot to me.

481
00:31:32,108 --> 00:31:35,051
You're welcome. Thank you for being cool about the dress.

482
00:31:35,057 --> 00:31:36,520
Oh, yeah, no problem.

483
00:31:36,526 --> 00:31:39,131
Listen, Rachel's here. Can you just try not to kill each other?

484
00:31:39,137 --> 00:31:41,251
Yeah, I actually invited her.

485
00:31:41,256 --> 00:31:43,482
- You what?!
- Long story.

486
00:31:51,937 --> 00:31:53,412
How's the hand?

487
00:31:54,486 --> 00:31:56,981
Kind of gross, actually.

488
00:31:58,636 --> 00:32:01,280
Thanks for covering for me at the store.

489
00:32:01,728 --> 00:32:04,963
Sure. Mirrors just break all the time.

490
00:32:06,336 --> 00:32:08,221
I didn't even tell Peyton.

491
00:32:11,136 --> 00:32:12,671
As long as you're okay.

492
00:32:12,678 --> 00:32:13,793
Brooke...

493
00:32:15,997 --> 00:32:20,122
...I broke the glass 'cause I was mad at myself for lying to Cooper.

494
00:32:20,127 --> 00:32:22,300
I mean, I know I just met him, but...

495
00:32:22,855 --> 00:32:24,482
I really liked him.

496
00:32:25,436 --> 00:32:28,341
And now he doesn't want to see me anymore.

497
00:32:30,975 --> 00:32:33,702
That sucks. I'm sorry.

498
00:32:36,108 --> 00:32:39,190
Why? I mean, you and me...

499
00:32:40,326 --> 00:32:42,023
Why are you sorry?

500
00:32:47,056 --> 00:32:51,143
Because I know what it feels like to have your heart broken,

501
00:32:52,096 --> 00:32:54,051
and I wouldn't wish that on anybody.

502
00:32:54,106 --> 00:32:55,542
Not even your worst enemy?

503
00:32:55,546 --> 00:32:56,793
Not even her.

504
00:33:10,418 --> 00:33:12,530
Hey. You showed up, man.

505
00:33:12,535 --> 00:33:13,562
Yeah.

506
00:33:13,566 --> 00:33:18,240
What the hell, dude. If this is your history, I can't figure out how you ever got married the first time.

507
00:33:18,477 --> 00:33:20,601
Hey, I thought you snuck out with Gigi.

508
00:33:21,028 --> 00:33:22,922
You remember Marcus, right?

509
00:33:22,927 --> 00:33:24,643
Yes, I do. Nice to see you.

510
00:33:24,655 --> 00:33:25,772
Hi.

511
00:33:26,018 --> 00:33:27,152
Congratulations.

512
00:33:27,157 --> 00:33:28,322
Thanks.

513
00:33:30,508 --> 00:33:33,583
Um, so, Nathan says you dropped out of school.

514
00:33:33,586 --> 00:33:36,893
Yeah, well, I kind of had a lot of stuff to deal with, you know?

515
00:33:36,897 --> 00:33:39,250
And, besides, my grades pretty much sucked anyway.

516
00:33:40,598 --> 00:33:44,541
Yeah, I think -- I think we all had a lot to deal with after that day.

517
00:33:48,166 --> 00:33:49,700
I can make you an offer, actually.

518
00:33:49,705 --> 00:33:52,001
If you want to come back to school, I'll tutor you.

519
00:33:52,006 --> 00:33:55,473
Yeah, she's a great tutor, man. She makes it all really easy.

520
00:33:56,626 --> 00:33:58,911
I'll think about it, okay?

521
00:34:01,417 --> 00:34:02,572
Thanks for coming.

522
00:34:02,577 --> 00:34:04,220
- Take it easy.
- Bye, guys.

523
00:34:08,117 --> 00:34:10,132
That was really nice of you, Haley.

524
00:34:12,177 --> 00:34:15,350
You know, even though two people lost their lives that day,

525
00:34:15,636 --> 00:34:19,732
maybe in some strange way, other people found theirs.

526
00:34:25,738 --> 00:34:28,623
Okay, P. Sawyer. Last scene of the night. Are we good?

527
00:34:29,388 --> 00:34:30,760
Actually, no.

528
00:34:30,768 --> 00:34:31,920
Mouth is sick, too.

529
00:34:31,937 --> 00:34:34,942
What? But we need him for this scene.

530
00:34:35,647 --> 00:34:37,980
I mean, Luke, you could do it.

531
00:34:39,307 --> 00:34:41,120
Maybe we should just cut the night short.

532
00:34:41,127 --> 00:34:44,392
No, we can't! This is the big finale. Please, Lucas?

533
00:34:44,895 --> 00:34:46,430
Okay, but no wig.

534
00:34:46,437 --> 00:34:47,782
Deal. Those are your lines.

535
00:34:47,786 --> 00:34:52,232
Um, I can buy you guys a couple of minutes. Just ad-lib if you get in trouble. Okay.

536
00:34:55,006 --> 00:34:56,913
You do know what scene this is, right?

537
00:34:56,915 --> 00:34:58,300
No, why?

538
00:35:08,717 --> 00:35:13,100
Before we end the night, I just wanted to say a few words about Nathan and Haley.

539
00:35:13,205 --> 00:35:16,602
I told them once, not long ago, to be happy

540
00:35:16,607 --> 00:35:19,513
because someday they'd make us all believe in true love.

541
00:35:19,515 --> 00:35:21,022
And they do.

542
00:35:21,096 --> 00:35:24,023
In a few days, they're gonna renew that love for all of us to see,

543
00:35:24,036 --> 00:35:26,501
but in a way, we see it every day.

544
00:35:26,505 --> 00:35:28,762
The only difference is that Haley will look fabulous

545
00:35:28,767 --> 00:35:30,930
in her wedding dress by Clothes over Bro's,

546
00:35:30,936 --> 00:35:33,771
which is kind of odd seeing as she's marrying a bro.

547
00:35:34,656 --> 00:35:37,043
But that's not the point. Sorry.

548
00:35:37,226 --> 00:35:42,932
One rainy day, Nathan Scott proposed to Haley James, and the rest is a fairy tale.

549
00:35:42,935 --> 00:35:44,923
This is the last scene of the night.

550
00:35:53,476 --> 00:35:55,790
Golly gee, that was some good loving, Haley.

551
00:35:55,798 --> 00:35:59,893
Oh, yes, yes, it was. Mm-hmm.

552
00:36:01,078 --> 00:36:04,370
So, uh, what are you thinking?

553
00:36:04,408 --> 00:36:08,811
Oh, I was just thinking how I never, uh...

554
00:36:13,287 --> 00:36:15,790
Never want to go home again.

555
00:36:18,027 --> 00:36:21,802
I was just thinking how I never want to go home again.

556
00:36:23,746 --> 00:36:26,703
I love you. You know that?

557
00:36:34,785 --> 00:36:36,523
Where's your head at, Peyton?

558
00:36:36,726 --> 00:36:41,720
Well, uh, when I went to bed tonight, I was living a fairy tale,

559
00:36:41,727 --> 00:36:45,623
and when I woke up, it's a nightmare.

560
00:36:45,686 --> 00:36:48,502
No, it's still a fairy tale. Don't give up on that.

561
00:36:49,658 --> 00:36:53,281
Look inside your heart and ask yourself, "is Lucas still there?"

562
00:36:54,345 --> 00:36:58,273
And if not... I'll be here.

563
00:37:13,328 --> 00:37:14,911
- Hey.
- Huh?

564
00:37:15,208 --> 00:37:16,540
I love you.

565
00:37:17,637 --> 00:37:18,822
You know that?

566
00:37:21,937 --> 00:37:23,880
Everything's gonna be all right, right?

567
00:37:23,886 --> 00:37:26,020
Yeah. Yeah, it is.

568
00:37:33,516 --> 00:37:36,112
You're always saving me.

569
00:37:37,075 --> 00:37:41,201
The truth is, I want all the same things that you want. I do.

570
00:37:42,097 --> 00:37:44,192
And I want them with you.

571
00:37:47,668 --> 00:37:49,293
I love you, too.

572
00:37:52,158 --> 00:37:55,393
"Once upon a time in a kingdom far, far away,

573
00:37:55,398 --> 00:37:58,310
there lived a beautiful princess who loved a boy."

574
00:38:10,407 --> 00:38:11,600
Rachel.

575
00:38:14,786 --> 00:38:16,561
Are you gonna be okay?

576
00:38:17,057 --> 00:38:19,290
Yeah, I'll be fine.

577
00:38:19,735 --> 00:38:21,381
It's his loss, right?

578
00:38:29,018 --> 00:38:32,811
So, thanks for the invite tonight and the offer.

579
00:38:33,628 --> 00:38:36,143
You know, it's not that easy to change who you are,

580
00:38:36,148 --> 00:38:38,811
but it helps when people let you try.

581
00:38:41,538 --> 00:38:43,723
- See you.
- See you later, man.

582
00:38:45,725 --> 00:38:50,132
You know, there's something I'd really like to do. Do you mind if I meet you back here?

583
00:38:50,135 --> 00:38:52,043
- No, not at all.
- Okay.

584
00:38:52,325 --> 00:38:53,452
See you.

585
00:39:13,098 --> 00:39:15,491
Hey, this is Cooper. You know the drill.

586
00:39:27,565 --> 00:39:30,641
"But the people had their struggles as all people do.

587
00:39:31,756 --> 00:39:36,152
And they had grown to fear and despise the king, whose heart had turned dark."

588
00:39:36,335 --> 00:39:37,453
Haley.

589
00:39:37,655 --> 00:39:38,791
Hi.

590
00:39:40,666 --> 00:39:43,981
Okay, so the last time I stood in a doorway giving someone the benefit of the doubt

591
00:39:43,987 --> 00:39:47,321
when my instincts were screaming at me not to, it was for Nathan.

592
00:39:48,157 --> 00:39:49,851
And this time...

593
00:39:51,096 --> 00:39:52,922
well, it's still for Nathan.

594
00:39:53,757 --> 00:39:56,212
We would like you to come to the wedding.

595
00:39:57,716 --> 00:39:58,663
Thank you.

596
00:39:58,666 --> 00:40:01,102
But god help you if you don't change.

597
00:40:09,508 --> 00:40:11,921
Hey, Luke, we're taking off.

598
00:40:12,187 --> 00:40:13,862
It was great to have you back, man.

599
00:40:13,867 --> 00:40:15,251
Thanks, brother.

600
00:40:15,925 --> 00:40:17,052
Yeah.

601
00:40:17,058 --> 00:40:18,462
Team misses you, Luke.

602
00:40:18,676 --> 00:40:19,763
Take care of yourself.

603
00:40:19,766 --> 00:40:21,582
Hey, catch you guys soon, all right?

604
00:40:26,047 --> 00:40:27,252
Happy to be back?

605
00:40:27,258 --> 00:40:29,450
Yeah, it's good to be home.

606
00:40:37,967 --> 00:40:43,333
"But in the end, the love between the princess and the boy was undeniable and true...

607
00:40:55,007 --> 00:40:59,051
And over time, that love would see them through anything."

608
00:41:03,728 --> 00:41:05,563
Where is our bedspread?

609
00:41:17,367 --> 00:41:21,362
"Magical things happened to them, things they couldn't explain,

610
00:41:21,367 --> 00:41:23,201
much like love itself.

611
00:41:24,367 --> 00:41:30,673
And like most fairy tales, the princess and the boy lived happily ever after."

612
00:41:40,725 --> 00:41:42,492
At least I hope they do.

613
00:41:53,867 --> 00:41:57,452
Way to go with the tears' piece where you brought down the house.

614
00:41:57,455 --> 00:41:58,730
Brooke...

615
00:41:59,398 --> 00:42:02,220
I think I still have feelings for Lucas.

616
00:42:04,537 --> 00:42:08,440
You mean you care for him... as a friend?

617
00:42:08,606 --> 00:42:09,793
No.

618
00:42:10,775 --> 00:42:12,513
I mean more than that.

619
