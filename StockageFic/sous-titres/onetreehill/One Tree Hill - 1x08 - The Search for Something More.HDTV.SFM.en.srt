1
00:01:41,442 --> 00:01:42,835
That’s gonna leave a mark.

2
00:01:44,412 --> 00:01:46,271
So what am I doing here?

3
00:01:46,577 --> 00:01:49,531
Brooke, that’s two weekends in a row you don’t remember what happened the night before.

4
00:01:50,024 --> 00:01:52,984
Oh, please tell me I didn’t make a fool of myself with Lucas.

5
00:01:53,685 --> 00:01:55,328
Nope, that would be me.

6
00:01:55,624 --> 00:01:57,869
Wait. You two were totally hot for each other.

7
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:58,713
Were.

8
00:01:59,067 --> 00:02:02,077
Until about halfway through ripping each other’s clothes off I bailed.

9
00:02:02,267 --> 00:02:05,502
- Because?
- Because he got all serious.

10
00:02:05,543 --> 00:02:08,580
He was talking about this intense commitment or I don’t know.

11
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,780
I don’t want to live in a world where two fine and willing girls like ourselves

12
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:15,910
can have such a lame Friday night.

13
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:19,660
I gotta change my karma.

14
00:02:20,162 --> 00:02:21,908
Maybe you should make some changes too.

15
00:02:22,349 --> 00:02:24,304
I didn’t wake up with a foggy memory.

16
00:02:24,493 --> 00:02:26,306
Well, you didn’t wake up with Lucas, either.

17
00:02:30,788 --> 00:02:33,465
Luke, did you ever hear of a UHF or their SARA?

18
00:02:33,878 --> 00:02:37,100
Yeah, UHF. They’re from Portland, right? They’re good.

19
00:02:37,217 --> 00:02:38,928
Um, but with SARA, they’re great.

20
00:02:39,092 --> 00:02:39,916
Cool

21
00:02:44,656 --> 00:02:45,405
You okay?

22
00:02:46,752 --> 00:02:47,807
Yeah, I can handle it.

23
00:02:51,765 --> 00:02:54,048
I called your house. Your mom said you're here.

24
00:02:54,201 --> 00:02:55,829
Crap. I should lie to her next time.

25
00:02:55,911 --> 00:02:58,395
Look, I didn’t know until Brooke read that note, okay?

26
00:02:58,426 --> 00:03:00,296
I didn’t even know there was a note until later.

27
00:03:01,009 --> 00:03:02,291
I wouldn’t do that to you.

28
00:03:04,411 --> 00:03:05,175
Okay.

29
00:03:05,887 --> 00:03:06,747
Great, so…

30
00:03:07,453 --> 00:03:08,293
cool?

31
00:03:08,683 --> 00:03:09,757
No, no.

32
00:03:10,381 --> 00:03:12,993
- Well, you believe me, right?
- Yeah, I believe you’re sorry.

33
00:03:13,188 --> 00:03:14,044
Well then, what…

34
00:03:14,427 --> 00:03:17,469
Look, this whole tutoring, hanging out, whatever it is, thing.

35
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:22,169
It’s just a bad idea. I’m done. I’m just done.

36
00:03:31,048 --> 00:03:33,658
So explain to me how this fixes your karma again.

37
00:03:33,714 --> 00:03:35,911
It doesn’t but it’s a total pick me up, don’t you think?

38
00:03:36,208 --> 00:03:37,730
Now, try this on.

39
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:43,480
Now the karma thing comes next.

40
00:03:43,813 --> 00:03:48,227
I figured out a master plan. If I can fix the damage I’ve done to certain people’s love lives,

41
00:03:48,278 --> 00:03:50,239
maybe the universe will kick in and fix mine.

42
00:03:50,597 --> 00:03:51,994
Pretty long list.

43
00:03:52,056 --> 00:03:55,666
Yeah, and Nathan and Haley are at the top of it. I screwed them over royally last night.

44
00:03:56,495 --> 00:03:58,298
Double karma points if I can undo that one.

45
00:04:00,463 --> 00:04:01,554
Fabulous!

46
00:04:02,066 --> 00:04:04,535
You know not everybody can pull off the sceezy in the jungle vibe.

47
00:04:04,606 --> 00:04:05,978
Now I can fix you up to.

48
00:04:06,261 --> 00:04:10,055
No thanks. I am done with the drama of dating. I just wanna have fun.

49
00:04:10,269 --> 00:04:13,173
Then you’ll be happy to know that I got us invited to a party at Duke tonight.

50
00:04:13,685 --> 00:04:16,071
So much for you changing your ways.

51
00:04:16,143 --> 00:04:21,358
What? You promised to have fun, and I promised to indulge in boys, not booze.

52
00:04:21,764 --> 00:04:23,413
And now we have something to wear.

53
00:04:28,333 --> 00:04:29,932
My omelet was perfect, Karen.

54
00:04:30,002 --> 00:04:31,139
Oh, thanks.

55
00:04:32,032 --> 00:04:33,121
And it’s on the house.

56
00:04:33,495 --> 00:04:36,987
It gives me an opportunity to repay you for your hospitality last night.

57
00:04:37,048 --> 00:04:38,877
Oh, not necessary, I had fun.

58
00:04:39,315 --> 00:04:41,514
Gotta love the mail service.

59
00:04:46,244 --> 00:04:47,285
Is everything okay?

60
00:04:47,376 --> 00:04:51,283
I just um, I had applied to this amazing cooking circle in Florence

61
00:04:51,344 --> 00:04:53,060
and they just had a last minute opening.

62
00:04:53,203 --> 00:04:55,032
Oh, well congratulations.

63
00:04:55,159 --> 00:04:57,228
I’ve not even been waitlisted before.

64
00:04:59,656 --> 00:05:02,262
Wait a minute. Six weeks in Italy?

65
00:05:02,927 --> 00:05:06,783
- Aren’t you excited?
- Starts next week. It’s not like I can go.

66
00:05:06,906 --> 00:05:09,993
- Then, why did you apply?
- As a lark.

67
00:05:10,293 --> 00:05:13,347
It’s just not a good time with Lucas and the café.

68
00:05:13,634 --> 00:05:15,902
It’s the opportunity of a lifetime.

69
00:05:16,486 --> 00:05:20,689
Yeah, well, I guess it will have to wait until some other lifetime.

70
00:05:29,358 --> 00:05:30,662
What do you want, Brooke?

71
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:32,881
To apologize.

72
00:05:33,947 --> 00:05:35,599
For what I did to you. You and Haley.

73
00:05:36,512 --> 00:05:37,601
You’re apologizing?

74
00:05:37,775 --> 00:05:39,209
Yeah, I know. Kinda weird, right?

75
00:05:39,598 --> 00:05:43,474
But I’m trying to appease the gods so… I’m sorry.

76
00:05:44,498 --> 00:05:48,575
Whatever. *** for drunken high school girls sick, so…

77
00:05:49,097 --> 00:05:50,572
Okay, I totally had that coming.

78
00:05:51,917 --> 00:05:55,722
I want you to know I’m going to fix it. Get you and Haley back on track.

79
00:05:56,076 --> 00:05:57,089
Not gonna happen.

80
00:05:57,775 --> 00:05:59,748
She made that pretty clear this morning.

81
00:06:00,847 --> 00:06:03,342
Leave it to me. What do you want to do on your date?

82
00:06:04,957 --> 00:06:05,855
What date?

83
00:06:06,552 --> 00:06:09,691
Never mind. No time to waste. I’ll call you later with details.

84
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:17,274
What’s with the boxes?

85
00:06:17,786 --> 00:06:20,433
Oh, bookshelves. And they were supposed to come assembled.

86
00:06:21,059 --> 00:06:22,907
You gonna put them together all by yourself?

87
00:06:23,024 --> 00:06:26,127
Actually, I was going to offer you dinner to help me.

88
00:06:27,728 --> 00:06:28,452
Sold.

89
00:06:29,295 --> 00:06:33,203
Perfect. I’ll be closing the café around seven. So it’s a date?

90
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:34,949
It’s a date.

91
00:06:42,293 --> 00:06:43,853
We’re closed.

92
00:06:46,205 --> 00:06:51,442
Oh, I get it. Closed to me. I don’t blame you. I’d be a bitch to me to after last night.

93
00:06:52,465 --> 00:06:54,115
Knock yourself out.

94
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:59,122
You’re feisty. I see what Nathan likes about you.

95
00:07:00,741 --> 00:07:04,292
Look, you’re blaming Nathan for something that I did and that’s not fair.

96
00:07:04,754 --> 00:07:09,792
Okay, I was drunk and I was pissed and I found your note and you know the rest…

97
00:07:11,836 --> 00:07:13,269
I want to make it up to you.

98
00:07:13,866 --> 00:07:14,852
By going away?

99
00:07:15,323 --> 00:07:17,540
By hooking you and Nathan up tonight.

100
00:07:18,196 --> 00:07:19,706
What’s  your idea of a perfect date?

101
00:07:19,957 --> 00:07:21,575
Watching you get hit by a bus.

102
00:07:21,775 --> 00:07:23,388
And that sense of humor…

103
00:07:23,731 --> 00:07:25,045
Nathan’s really lucky.

104
00:07:26,045 --> 00:07:28,119
He’ll be here at 7. Have fun.

105
00:07:35,246 --> 00:07:40,080
Bonjourno. I am Marcello Vivari of the Genoculudidian Institute in Florence.

106
00:07:40,274 --> 00:07:43,706
- I call for Seniorina Karen Roe.
- When’s that ‘do not call list’ kick in?

107
00:07:43,777 --> 00:07:45,906
Excuse me, but we haven’t heard from you.

108
00:07:46,002 --> 00:07:50,146
We sent a letter inviting you to start next week and, we haven’t heard a word

109
00:07:50,219 --> 00:07:52,721
so would you be call enough to call me back.

110
00:07:53,597 --> 00:07:55,374
Isn’t  that that school you’ve been talking about forever?

111
00:07:55,819 --> 00:07:56,537
Yeah…

112
00:07:57,198 --> 00:07:58,206
Mom, that’s great!

113
00:07:59,051 --> 00:08:02,123
It’s no big deal. I’m not gonna go.

114
00:08:03,055 --> 00:08:05,870
It is a big deal, Mom. Come on, it’s a huge deal.

115
00:08:06,919 --> 00:08:09,169
Well maybe I’ll just go some other time.

116
00:08:09,246 --> 00:08:11,202
No, Mom. Now’s the time.

117
00:08:11,754 --> 00:08:13,674
Come on, you’ve put your whole life on hold for me.

118
00:08:14,068 --> 00:08:15,707
Every choice you’ve made has been about me.

119
00:08:15,943 --> 00:08:18,032
That’s the way it’s supposed to be. I’m your mother.

120
00:08:18,087 --> 00:08:19,521
And I want you to have this.

121
00:08:20,489 --> 00:08:22,086
It’s time for you to do something for yourself.

122
00:08:23,388 --> 00:08:24,560
I’ll think about it.

123
00:08:24,688 --> 00:08:25,738
Don’t think about it, Mom.

124
00:08:26,679 --> 00:08:27,474
Do it.

125
00:08:41,723 --> 00:08:45,744
We’re young, we’re fun. Lets do some damage.

126
00:08:47,217 --> 00:08:48,545
Want some while it lasts?

127
00:08:48,651 --> 00:08:51,047
No thanks. Designated driver.

128
00:08:54,637 --> 00:08:55,890
Too desperate…

129
00:08:57,310 --> 00:08:58,856
Too geeky…

130
00:09:02,246 --> 00:09:04,939
Hello, Abercrombie.

131
00:09:25,417 --> 00:09:26,280
Wow,

132
00:09:26,941 --> 00:09:30,090
Fugazi, Sparta… on vinyl.

133
00:09:31,565 --> 00:09:32,491
Do you mind?

134
00:09:41,197 --> 00:09:44,576
Milo Goes To College. This is a great album.

135
00:09:46,659 --> 00:09:48,109
You know The Descendants?

136
00:09:48,534 --> 00:09:49,143
Yeah.

137
00:09:50,322 --> 00:09:51,266
I’m Peyton.

138
00:09:52,205 --> 00:09:52,917
I’m Gabe…

139
00:09:54,237 --> 00:09:55,160
You wanna hear it?

140
00:10:05,165 --> 00:10:07,947
That’s too easy man, you gotta play some defense.

141
00:10:07,996 --> 00:10:10,218
The prodigal son returns.

142
00:10:10,392 --> 00:10:13,725
- Hey, Mouth, how you doing, baby?
- Hey sir remembers my name… heh.

143
00:10:15,566 --> 00:10:18,717
- Have we met?
- How’s it going, Junk?

144
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:21,500
Ferguson Thompson.

145
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,700
Okay, guys, come on, it has not been that long.

146
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:26,940
It feels like forever, dawg. I mean, do you still play street ball?

147
00:10:27,688 --> 00:10:28,400
Better than you.

148
00:10:28,906 --> 00:10:31,389
Aw, baby, he’s been back two seconds and he’s already talkin’ right.

149
00:10:31,524 --> 00:10:35,042
- Ooh… lets see what you get.
- Fine. Shoot for teams.

150
00:10:35,179 --> 00:10:38,968
You know what, why don’t you and Fergie just take it, cuz, you gonna need it.

151
00:10:39,122 --> 00:10:42,504
- Oh really? Like that.
- Just like that. Lock him up, man.

152
00:10:43,547 --> 00:10:45,698
- So what are you drinking?
- I’m not tonight.

153
00:10:45,979 --> 00:10:49,387
Yeah? Me neither. Killer exam on Monday.

154
00:10:49,619 --> 00:10:50,566
Really? On what?

155
00:10:51,032 --> 00:10:51,959
Psychology.

156
00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:55,093
Human sexuality, actually.

157
00:10:55,953 --> 00:10:59,649
What a coincidence. I specialize in sexuality.

158
00:10:59,931 --> 00:11:01,866
Maybe we can be studypartners.

159
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,661
So there’s no way you have this one.

160
00:11:06,168 --> 00:11:08,639
Please. I’ve got it on colored vinyl.

161
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:14,218
Okay. I was wrong about you.

162
00:11:15,215 --> 00:11:17,167
I guess the, uh, clothes through me off.

163
00:11:17,545 --> 00:11:20,002
I’m into the music, not the uniform.

164
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,102
Same as me.

165
00:11:22,338 --> 00:11:27,720
Yeah? Well maybe some of us can love the song without painting our fingernails black.

166
00:11:33,397 --> 00:11:34,559
Let me get you a drink.

167
00:11:35,809 --> 00:11:37,402
I’m not really drinking tonight.

168
00:11:38,446 --> 00:11:40,396
So that’s why we haven’t met before.

169
00:11:40,746 --> 00:11:41,821
You’re still in high school.

170
00:11:42,542 --> 00:11:45,567
Yeah. I’m a regular cheerleader.

171
00:11:46,997 --> 00:11:50,023
Right, right… you’re a straight edge?

172
00:11:51,693 --> 00:11:52,598
Not really.

173
00:11:54,048 --> 00:11:56,030
How about it? One drink.

174
00:11:56,562 --> 00:11:58,522
We haven’t even gotten to my bootleg collection.

175
00:12:01,483 --> 00:12:02,328
Why not?

176
00:12:23,366 --> 00:12:25,707
Okay. Done.

177
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:27,407
Catch. I’m gonna head-

178
00:12:29,486 --> 00:12:30,096
Out.

179
00:12:39,268 --> 00:12:40,366
What are you doing here?

180
00:12:41,165 --> 00:12:43,090
Didn’t Brooke tell you I was going to come?

181
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:46,522
I try to block out everything that Brooke says so whatever you guys are up to

182
00:12:46,629 --> 00:12:48,564
- I’m just not in the mood.
- I’m not up to anything.

183
00:12:48,615 --> 00:12:51,476
Look, I apologized and I told you the truth.

184
00:12:52,229 --> 00:12:55,805
The rest is Brooke. She set up this whole serial date thing.

185
00:12:56,823 --> 00:12:58,240
One card leads to the next.

186
00:12:59,706 --> 00:13:01,318
Well, what does the first one say?

187
00:13:03,602 --> 00:13:04,990
Convince Haley to go.

188
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,339
How am I doing so far?

189
00:13:10,545 --> 00:13:12,772
I don’t know. It depends on what the second card says.

190
00:13:16,710 --> 00:13:19,974
Go to 1423 River Street and find your next envelope.

191
00:13:20,213 --> 00:13:22,814
On the way, tell three things you like about each other.

192
00:13:23,679 --> 00:13:25,988
- I don’t know…
- Look, I’ll go first.

193
00:13:26,952 --> 00:13:28,753
You’re the most patient person I know.

194
00:13:31,016 --> 00:13:36,035
You don’t go postal on me during tutoring and you don’t treat me like some kind of a moron.

195
00:13:36,966 --> 00:13:38,421
I really appreciate that.

196
00:13:41,242 --> 00:13:43,761
Look, I know I have no right to ask,

197
00:13:44,564 --> 00:13:47,796
but we never do anything just fun together.

198
00:13:48,081 --> 00:13:51,809
And plus, this is Brooke. I mean, you can bet it’s not gonna be boring.

199
00:13:53,991 --> 00:13:55,317
I’m free to bail whenever?

200
00:13:55,969 --> 00:13:56,892
A bsolutely.

201
00:13:58,041 --> 00:13:58,820
Trust me.

202
00:14:04,735 --> 00:14:06,081
Okay, what the hell.

203
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:11,467
Brooke, lets go to your room.

204
00:14:11,569 --> 00:14:13,572
Um, you know what, yours is better.

205
00:14:14,318 --> 00:14:15,352
Sick roommate.

206
00:14:16,039 --> 00:14:17,002
You live in this dorm?

207
00:14:20,524 --> 00:14:22,793
Across campus. Way across.

208
00:14:23,761 --> 00:14:25,973
I got my car.

209
00:14:26,188 --> 00:14:27,842
Okay. Great. Lets start there.

210
00:14:34,272 --> 00:14:34,902
It’s you.

211
00:14:37,535 --> 00:14:40,002
Hello? I can’t hear…

212
00:14:40,837 --> 00:14:41,737
Right now?

213
00:14:42,972 --> 00:14:45,234
But you said that I could stay until midnight…

214
00:14:45,701 --> 00:14:46,757
This sucks.

215
00:14:51,415 --> 00:14:53,033
I’m sorry, was that you mom?

216
00:14:54,416 --> 00:14:55,763
What, are you in high school?

217
00:14:57,043 --> 00:15:01,794
Yeah… but these parties are a great place to meet college girls.

218
00:15:02,844 --> 00:15:03,879
Can I get your number?

219
00:15:03,961 --> 00:15:06,413
What kind of loser pretends he’s in college?

220
00:15:08,144 --> 00:15:09,546
I’ll take that for a no.

221
00:15:15,517 --> 00:15:16,874
Real funny.

222
00:15:21,482 --> 00:15:22,229
Hey.

223
00:15:24,614 --> 00:15:25,405
Are you okay?

224
00:15:26,859 --> 00:15:27,642
I don’t know.

225
00:15:29,844 --> 00:15:31,012
What’s this?

226
00:15:31,334 --> 00:15:32,255
Why? You like it?

227
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:36,808
Did you slip me something.

228
00:15:41,078 --> 00:15:42,563
Oh god I…

229
00:15:43,428 --> 00:15:45,753
Lie down. Good idea.

230
00:15:54,948 --> 00:15:56,255
Leave me alone.

231
00:16:01,872 --> 00:16:02,900
Get off me…

232
00:16:07,001 --> 00:16:08,122
Get off me…

233
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:20,586
Peyton!

234
00:16:30,699 --> 00:16:32,168
Are you looking for someone?

235
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:33,734
Yeah. No, my friend’s in here. Get it open.

236
00:16:37,510 --> 00:16:39,485
- Hey!
- Get out!

237
00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:40,837
Get off of her.

238
00:16:42,791 --> 00:16:45,911
Peyton! Oh my god, this perv attacked my friend.

239
00:16:46,039 --> 00:16:48,154
She’s lying. Her friend’s just wasted.

240
00:16:49,006 --> 00:16:50,178
Peyton, come on.

241
00:16:51,784 --> 00:16:53,566
She shouldn’t drink so much.

242
00:16:57,708 --> 00:16:58,942
What’s on your mind, Keith?

243
00:17:00,304 --> 00:17:01,959
What? Is it that obvious?

244
00:17:02,733 --> 00:17:04,319
Well, you just seem a little preoccupied.

245
00:17:05,634 --> 00:17:11,052
Yeah, well, last night after Dan’s party I realized something and I’m tired of settling.

246
00:17:11,963 --> 00:17:12,777
How so?

247
00:17:13,678 --> 00:17:18,728
Well, I developed a bad habit somehow just, uh,

248
00:17:19,388 --> 00:17:22,842
letting things happen to me instead of going after what I really want.

249
00:17:23,863 --> 00:17:25,799
Yeah, I know what you’re saying.

250
00:17:25,870 --> 00:17:28,549
Sometimes I feel like I’m too old to take risks.

251
00:17:28,855 --> 00:17:30,068
Well, yeah, but we’re not.

252
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:33,059
Hell, why can’t we still be as fearless as we were when we were kids?

253
00:17:34,544 --> 00:17:38,415
Because we have mortgages and businesses

254
00:17:38,472 --> 00:17:41,779
and more responsibility than we ever dreamed of back then.

255
00:17:41,846 --> 00:17:45,364
Well, yeah, but don’t you think we should still take a chance every now and then.

256
00:17:47,956 --> 00:17:49,285
Find something you want and…

257
00:17:51,144 --> 00:17:51,928
go for it.

258
00:17:54,647 --> 00:17:55,583
Like what?

259
00:17:58,179 --> 00:18:00,509
Oh, that’s the bread. Hold that thought.

260
00:18:04,211 --> 00:18:07,585
And Scott is back with a vengeance, showing the locals how it’s done.

261
00:18:07,667 --> 00:18:08,865
That was nice, Lucas.

262
00:18:13,005 --> 00:18:15,163
Man, you got a cell phone too, dawg?

263
00:18:16,061 --> 00:18:17,878
Dang, you sure have changed, man.

264
00:18:18,303 --> 00:18:19,199
Hello?

265
00:18:19,286 --> 00:18:22,251
Lucas, Peyton’s in trouble. Somebody drugged her drink and I can’t wake her up.

266
00:18:22,318 --> 00:18:23,325
Okay, Brooke. Slow down.

267
00:18:23,661 --> 00:18:25,788
- Where are you?
- We’re on the steps of Chapman Hall.

268
00:18:25,845 --> 00:18:27,003
Alright, call the campus police.

269
00:18:27,202 --> 00:18:28,856
I can’t. She’s been drinking!

270
00:18:29,158 --> 00:18:30,591
Okay, I’ll be right there.

271
00:18:32,051 --> 00:18:32,901
Gotta go, guys.

272
00:18:34,222 --> 00:18:34,990
Yo, Luke!

273
00:18:39,014 --> 00:18:42,168
- Nathan joining us?
- No, he had a date with Haley.

274
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:45,885
His tutor? Must be a mercy thing.

275
00:18:46,075 --> 00:18:48,190
Okay… you did not just say that.

276
00:18:48,441 --> 00:18:51,165
Come on, she’s from Westover. Her father works for the power company.

277
00:18:52,430 --> 00:18:54,749
So, what are you saying? That she’s somehow… beneath him?

278
00:18:54,959 --> 00:18:57,188
Don’t be so dramatic. I’m just saying Nathan could do better.

279
00:18:57,396 --> 00:18:59,388
Hmm, funny, that’s what my parents said about you.

280
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:00,632
And I proved them wrong.

281
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:03,710
Well that may be. You should give Haley a chance to do the same.

282
00:19:08,155 --> 00:19:09,470
And number three?

283
00:19:10,377 --> 00:19:12,542
Your loyalty. To Lucas.

284
00:19:13,286 --> 00:19:16,772
I know I’m not always wild about how it plays out, but it’s cool.

285
00:19:18,241 --> 00:19:20,592
Okay, three things I like about you.

286
00:19:20,853 --> 00:19:21,682
My good looks.

287
00:19:23,572 --> 00:19:27,207
I like the way you let me in, past all the bluster you give everybody else.

288
00:19:28,852 --> 00:19:31,196
And I like your smile when you solve a problem.

289
00:19:31,944 --> 00:19:35,312
And… you’re not horrible to look at.

290
00:19:39,368 --> 00:19:40,806
This is where we’re going?

291
00:19:42,446 --> 00:19:43,428
Nice work, Brooke.

292
00:19:48,268 --> 00:19:49,378
Is your friend okay?

293
00:19:49,624 --> 00:19:51,308
I don’t know; she can’t stay awake.

294
00:19:51,883 --> 00:19:52,989
Do you know where you are?

295
00:19:54,426 --> 00:19:55,373
Do you know your name?

296
00:19:55,963 --> 00:19:58,057
Just… dizzy.

297
00:20:06,517 --> 00:20:07,336
Brooke!

298
00:20:09,036 --> 00:20:10,807
Sorry, I didn’t know who else to call.

299
00:20:11,324 --> 00:20:12,210
Is she okay?

300
00:20:12,466 --> 00:20:16,450
She’s  not drunk. I think he gave her a sedative. We just need to know what it was.

301
00:20:17,663 --> 00:20:18,569
I’m a med student.

302
00:20:19,978 --> 00:20:22,594
Okay, Brooke. I need you to show me what room she was in.

303
00:20:23,008 --> 00:20:23,797
Okay.

304
00:20:24,771 --> 00:20:26,622
- Can you stay with her?
- Sure.

305
00:20:27,038 --> 00:20:27,795
Alright, come on.

306
00:20:36,184 --> 00:20:36,932
It’s this one.

307
00:20:39,834 --> 00:20:41,888
- Hey, open the door.
- Piss off.

308
00:20:42,988 --> 00:20:45,267
Piss off. Is this your dorm?

309
00:20:46,469 --> 00:20:47,366
Go get your R.A.

310
00:20:51,108 --> 00:20:52,414
- Hey man!
- It’s him.

311
00:20:54,211 --> 00:20:55,574
What did you put in her drink?

312
00:20:56,050 --> 00:20:57,222
I didn’t put anything in her drink.

313
00:20:57,423 --> 00:20:59,656
You can tell me, or you can tell the police.

314
00:21:02,563 --> 00:21:04,858
It was nothing, man. Alright? It was one roofie.

315
00:21:05,005 --> 00:21:05,784
Where are they?

316
00:21:10,781 --> 00:21:12,256
I said where are they!

317
00:21:13,106 --> 00:21:15,031
They’re over there. In the box.

318
00:21:26,737 --> 00:21:29,721
Oh. You better hope to God she’s alright.

319
00:21:40,208 --> 00:21:41,995
This would go a lot faster if you helped.

320
00:21:43,368 --> 00:21:44,673
I’m gonna kill Brooke.

321
00:21:46,726 --> 00:21:48,974
Okay, here it is.

322
00:21:53,322 --> 00:21:57,945
Congratulations. Now, buy each other a gift and exchange them on the way to…

323
00:21:58,145 --> 00:22:00,829
- there’s another address here.
- This is so wrong.

324
00:22:01,519 --> 00:22:03,788
- You want to do it?
- I didn’t say that…

325
00:22:05,051 --> 00:22:05,917
Lets shop.

326
00:22:08,163 --> 00:22:10,931
- Did you see what that saleswoman was wearing?
- Or not wearing.

327
00:22:11,032 --> 00:22:13,327
Here. You go first.

328
00:22:13,664 --> 00:22:14,319
Alright.

329
00:22:17,669 --> 00:22:19,880
- Socks.
- I was playing it safe.

330
00:22:20,864 --> 00:22:21,600
What did you get me?

331
00:22:23,371 --> 00:22:24,335
Open it and see.

332
00:22:29,226 --> 00:22:30,449
Oh my gosh.

333
00:22:30,817 --> 00:22:32,005
This is really nice.

334
00:22:33,611 --> 00:22:34,382
Thanks.

335
00:22:34,498 --> 00:22:38,789
Okay. If we go to this next place and we hate it, then we can just get some pizza, alright?

336
00:22:39,593 --> 00:22:40,233
Okay.

337
00:22:51,024 --> 00:22:55,462
Says here she’ll be disoriented, may have some short term memory loss,

338
00:22:56,557 --> 00:22:58,221
which is maybe not a bad thing.

339
00:23:00,557 --> 00:23:01,924
How long ‘til it wears off?

340
00:23:02,682 --> 00:23:04,105
Overnight, probably.

341
00:23:06,219 --> 00:23:07,293
Think she’ll be okay?

342
00:23:08,519 --> 00:23:09,558
I don’t know, Brooke.

343
00:23:10,535 --> 00:23:12,449
I feel terrible. It’s all my fault.

344
00:23:13,777 --> 00:23:15,835
Yeah, well, what’s done is done.

345
00:23:18,513 --> 00:23:20,321
The med student says she’s gonna be okay, right?

346
00:23:20,367 --> 00:23:23,250
So we just need to watch her until she wakes up.

347
00:23:24,007 --> 00:23:24,909
I can do it.

348
00:23:25,773 --> 00:23:27,355
You’ve done way too much already.

349
00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:31,560
I don’t mind hanging out.

350
00:23:32,083 --> 00:23:34,843
Besides, I’d worry about her too much if I took off anyway.

351
00:23:36,716 --> 00:23:37,417
Okay.

352
00:23:40,823 --> 00:23:41,576
Look.

353
00:23:43,862 --> 00:23:47,017
It's not your fault, okay?

354
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:51,667
And hey, you did get her out of there.

355
00:23:59,377 --> 00:24:00,181
Here you go, Miss…

356
00:24:01,744 --> 00:24:03,064
- Sir.
- Thanks…

357
00:24:05,003 --> 00:24:07,289
To be honest, I’m a little afraid.

358
00:24:12,061 --> 00:24:14,339
Order your favorite dish for the other person.

359
00:24:14,694 --> 00:24:16,644
Any chance your favorite dish it… prime rib?

360
00:24:16,889 --> 00:24:18,595
Yeah, we have a lot of that at my house.

361
00:24:22,255 --> 00:24:24,713
I’m not very experienced with this so, uh…

362
00:24:25,083 --> 00:24:25,938
Ordering food?

363
00:24:26,475 --> 00:24:29,265
No. I mean, with Peyton,

364
00:24:30,270 --> 00:24:32,554
it was all just parties and games and drama.

365
00:24:33,423 --> 00:24:35,503
I never really did anything like this.

366
00:24:35,962 --> 00:24:36,823
This is different.

367
00:24:39,902 --> 00:24:42,711
Different… good? Different weird?

368
00:24:42,921 --> 00:24:44,632
- No, good.
- Okay.

369
00:24:46,572 --> 00:24:48,026
I’m really glad you decided to come.

370
00:24:53,577 --> 00:24:58,103
So the other night, after the SPL banquet, you said something.

371
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:02,598
- Yeah, I know.
- You said that you…

372
00:25:03,557 --> 00:25:05,139
you weren’t the person you want to be.

373
00:25:07,208 --> 00:25:08,559
I feel the same.

374
00:25:10,054 --> 00:25:11,892
Yeah, well, maybe it’s time we change that.

375
00:25:13,352 --> 00:25:14,437
I want to.

376
00:25:16,398 --> 00:25:17,540
I’m a little scared.

377
00:25:18,615 --> 00:25:21,160
You don’t need to be. I promise.

378
00:25:23,969 --> 00:25:27,196
Good. Because there’s something I want to talk to you about.

379
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:28,144
Me too.

380
00:25:29,912 --> 00:25:30,848
You first.

381
00:25:34,887 --> 00:25:38,044
I got accepted to this cooking program in Italy.

382
00:25:38,313 --> 00:25:41,186
It’s been a dream of mine since I was a teenager.

383
00:25:44,570 --> 00:25:47,022
Well, that’s... that’s great.

384
00:25:49,263 --> 00:25:50,285
When would you leave?

385
00:25:50,699 --> 00:25:52,451
Oh. Right away, actually.

386
00:25:53,295 --> 00:25:54,923
I’d have to leave the day after tomorrow.

387
00:25:56,715 --> 00:25:59,952
- Well, for how long?
- Six weeks.

388
00:26:00,611 --> 00:26:03,783
But I mean, do I have a right to go traipsing half way across the world

389
00:26:03,828 --> 00:26:06,925
when I have a son and a business to worry about?

390
00:26:08,964 --> 00:26:11,544
Well, you’ve got good instincts, so what does your gut say?

391
00:26:13,005 --> 00:26:15,697
- That I should go.
- Then you should trust that.

392
00:26:16,671 --> 00:26:21,919
I mean, you know, you spent your whole life putting Lucas first and he’s a good kid,

393
00:26:23,159 --> 00:26:25,318
but now you need to go after a dream of your own.

394
00:26:27,053 --> 00:26:29,368
- That’s what Lucas said.
- Well he’s right.

395
00:26:34,771 --> 00:26:36,189
Here’s to your great adventure.

396
00:26:46,091 --> 00:26:47,050
Still sleeping?

397
00:26:49,772 --> 00:26:51,391
Here, I made some coffee if you want...

398
00:26:53,322 --> 00:26:54,560
I don't know how you do it.

399
00:26:55,902 --> 00:26:58,820
It's easy. The directions are on the bag.

400
00:27:00,136 --> 00:27:01,185
You know what I mean.

401
00:27:01,846 --> 00:27:05,190
You'd give up everything to help her after what happened at Nathan's house.

402
00:27:05,999 --> 00:27:07,156
She told you about that?

403
00:27:08,852 --> 00:27:09,685
A little...

404
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:15,636
Look, the thing about Peyton; it's really hard for her to let her guard down

405
00:27:15,727 --> 00:27:20,592
but once she does, she's got this amazing heart, you know.

406
00:27:20,688 --> 00:27:22,578
Sounds like something the two of you have in common...

407
00:27:23,654 --> 00:27:24,355
Who knew.

408
00:27:27,192 --> 00:27:28,819
So you don't have any brothers, do you?

409
00:27:30,894 --> 00:27:32,452
You mean... besides Nathan.

410
00:27:33,309 --> 00:27:34,104
Yeah...

411
00:27:38,164 --> 00:27:39,567
How’d that work anyway?

412
00:27:40,689 --> 00:27:43,847
- I mean, are you…
- I’m three months older.

413
00:27:45,564 --> 00:27:47,698
My mom got pregnant right after her senior year.

414
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:52,312
Dan moved on to Nathan’s mom the first semester of college.

415
00:27:52,666 --> 00:27:54,723
That must have been really hard for your mom.

416
00:27:57,248 --> 00:27:59,147
So you two are pretty close.

417
00:27:59,767 --> 00:28:03,105
Yeah. We do a lot of stuff together.

418
00:28:03,674 --> 00:28:04,401
We talk...

419
00:28:05,907 --> 00:28:06,935
She's really great.

420
00:28:07,771 --> 00:28:11,830
Sounds nice. My parents would rather throw cash at me

421
00:28:11,878 --> 00:28:15,057
and send me on my way then spend any time with me.

422
00:28:23,597 --> 00:28:25,364
Listen, you can grab some sleep if you want.

423
00:28:25,938 --> 00:28:27,197
I'll watch her for a while.

424
00:28:27,949 --> 00:28:28,686
Okay.

425
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:32,471
I'd rather stay and talk to you if you don't mind.

426
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,438
I don't mind...

427
00:28:41,509 --> 00:28:42,789
I thought you’d be into lobster.

428
00:28:43,264 --> 00:28:45,860
Dude, macaroni and cheese is food of the gods.

429
00:28:46,055 --> 00:28:47,646
Yeah, if the gods are five year olds.

430
00:28:50,321 --> 00:28:51,662
Ready for this next envelope?

431
00:28:51,907 --> 00:28:52,477
Yes.

432
00:28:56,425 --> 00:28:58,953
Reveal a secret that nobody else knows about you.

433
00:28:59,767 --> 00:29:00,372
Okay.

434
00:29:02,364 --> 00:29:05,431
When I was in second grade, I stole some candy.

435
00:29:06,223 --> 00:29:07,683
Come on, that’s not a secret.

436
00:29:08,196 --> 00:29:09,240
Tell me for something to real.

437
00:29:14,279 --> 00:29:16,531
I cheated on a Geometry test last year.

438
00:29:18,288 --> 00:29:19,814
Haley James cheated?

439
00:29:20,223 --> 00:29:20,930
Yeah.

440
00:29:21,821 --> 00:29:24,361
My dad was out of town and um, my mom was sick

441
00:29:24,791 --> 00:29:27,388
and I had to take care of her so I didn’t really have time to study.

442
00:29:28,892 --> 00:29:29,645
Did you get caught?

443
00:29:30,050 --> 00:29:32,098
No. That wasn't the point.

444
00:29:32,184 --> 00:29:36,026
I mean, I knew what I had done and that didn’t sit right for me.

445
00:29:37,612 --> 00:29:38,809
So you started tutoring?

446
00:29:39,594 --> 00:29:40,342
Yeah.

447
00:29:41,699 --> 00:29:47,781
Yeah. I guess I thought it would be like, penance, or something. But it turns out I really liked it.

448
00:29:49,282 --> 00:29:50,715
I thought it was just to get to me.

449
00:29:52,630 --> 00:29:53,805
So, what about you? 

450
00:29:53,909 --> 00:29:55,611
- What’s your… secret?
- What’s up, Nathan?

451
00:29:57,484 --> 00:29:59,553
- Hey.
- What’s up, guys?

452
00:30:00,525 --> 00:30:01,391
What’s this?

453
00:30:02,190 --> 00:30:03,910
Well, you know Haley’s my tutor, right?

454
00:30:04,612 --> 00:30:06,087
Looks more like a date to me.

455
00:30:06,890 --> 00:30:09,065
No, dude, it’s definitely not a date.

456
00:30:10,407 --> 00:30:12,446
Okay. If that’s your story.

457
00:30:18,007 --> 00:30:19,675
Hey, I’m sorry about that.

458
00:30:19,747 --> 00:30:21,632
Are you really that embarrassed to be seen with me?

459
00:30:21,739 --> 00:30:23,424
No. He just, he was gonna-

460
00:30:23,721 --> 00:30:26,414
Why are you only nice to me when we’re alone?

461
00:30:32,551 --> 00:30:33,664
You know,

462
00:30:35,143 --> 00:30:38,432
for a few hours there I was actually starting to think that you weren’t a son of a bitch

463
00:30:38,487 --> 00:30:40,469
and you just, God, fooled me again.

464
00:30:42,221 --> 00:30:43,618
No! Haley, wait.

465
00:30:52,609 --> 00:30:56,762
Hey. How are you feeling?

466
00:30:58,217 --> 00:30:58,928
Like hell.

467
00:31:00,116 --> 00:31:01,176
What are you doing here?

468
00:31:04,069 --> 00:31:05,548
You don’t remember last night, huh?

469
00:31:08,359 --> 00:31:10,725
I remember Brooke took me to a party.

470
00:31:12,363 --> 00:31:14,376
A guy slipped you something in your drink.

471
00:31:15,958 --> 00:31:17,090
Brooke called me to help out.

472
00:31:17,422 --> 00:31:20,284
No, nothing happened! Brooke stopped him.

473
00:31:23,105 --> 00:31:24,821
Alright, I’m gonna go wake her up, okay?

474
00:31:25,631 --> 00:31:26,350
Wait!

475
00:31:28,421 --> 00:31:31,041
Thanks. Again.

476
00:31:31,750 --> 00:31:33,741
I just wanted to make sure you were okay, alright?

477
00:31:35,251 --> 00:31:36,004
Lucas…

478
00:31:38,815 --> 00:31:39,840
I’m sorry.

479
00:31:42,354 --> 00:31:43,101
For what?

480
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:45,723
All sorts of things.

481
00:32:03,014 --> 00:32:04,237
You want me to follow you home?

482
00:32:05,471 --> 00:32:07,949
- No. I'll be okay.
- Okay.

483
00:32:09,854 --> 00:32:11,893
So why'd you call me, anyway?

484
00:32:13,029 --> 00:32:15,636
I'm not Nathan or one of the guys...

485
00:32:17,698 --> 00:32:19,250
Because I knew you'd come through.

486
00:32:22,768 --> 00:32:24,034
You're a good friend to her, Brooke.

487
00:32:24,621 --> 00:32:25,915
You sound surprised.

488
00:32:26,388 --> 00:32:30,423
Sorry, I just... I guess I just figured that you were...

489
00:32:30,725 --> 00:32:33,813
- A brainless slut.
- No. You're not.

490
00:32:35,098 --> 00:32:39,009
What I was gonna say was that I just… I didn't think that you were...

491
00:32:39,925 --> 00:32:44,089
that tough. But I was clearly wrong about you.

492
00:32:45,805 --> 00:32:46,623
It's okay.

493
00:32:47,648 --> 00:32:48,696
Most people are.

494
00:32:55,287 --> 00:33:00,073
Hey Brooke... call me. If you need anything, okay?

495
00:33:01,878 --> 00:33:02,941
Count on that.

496
00:33:16,189 --> 00:33:19,680
Please tell me that you were somewhere in the land of no phones.

497
00:33:20,422 --> 00:33:21,185
I know.

498
00:33:22,408 --> 00:33:23,260
I should’ve called.

499
00:33:23,388 --> 00:33:25,922
Coming home would’ve been another option.

500
00:33:26,715 --> 00:33:27,919
You’re right. I’m sorry.

501
00:33:28,236 --> 00:33:32,696
You looked me in the eye and said ‘Go to Italy. I can take care of myself.’

502
00:33:32,763 --> 00:33:33,797
Look, I can, Mom!

503
00:33:34,519 --> 00:33:36,311
A guy drugged Peyton’s drink at a party.

504
00:33:36,598 --> 00:33:39,588
Brooke called me for help. I took her home, waited until she felt better.

505
00:33:40,664 --> 00:33:41,401
Truth.

506
00:33:43,091 --> 00:33:45,242
As excuses go, that’s pretty solid.

507
00:33:47,090 --> 00:33:49,454
- Is she okay?
- Yeah, she’ll be fine.

508
00:33:51,498 --> 00:33:55,056
Drugs, parties, and I’m supposed to leave the country.

509
00:33:55,281 --> 00:33:57,406
Hey, don’t not go to Italy because of this.

510
00:33:58,528 --> 00:33:59,881
Okay, Mom, please?

511
00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:04,817
We’ll see. But if I do decide to go I’m going to have Keith come and stay here while I’m gone.

512
00:34:04,990 --> 00:34:06,880
Great, just as long as you go.

513
00:34:12,542 --> 00:34:16,302
I went on Peyton’s computer and booked you a flight on the emergency credit card,

514
00:34:17,488 --> 00:34:18,661
non-refundable.

515
00:34:21,678 --> 00:34:23,551
I want you to have something for yourself, Mom.

516
00:34:27,365 --> 00:34:28,277
You’ve earned it.

517
00:34:47,529 --> 00:34:50,048
Trying to wake up my parents? That’s their room.

518
00:34:51,497 --> 00:34:54,836
Wait! Haley, look, I need to apologize, okay?

519
00:34:55,650 --> 00:34:58,405
You should write them in bulk if you’re going to hand apologies out that often.

520
00:34:59,009 --> 00:35:04,529
Can we just- I don’t know how to do this, alright? I’m not like you.

521
00:35:04,887 --> 00:35:05,804
What does that mean?

522
00:35:06,501 --> 00:35:12,441
I screw up a lot, alright? And being around you, I just, I don’t want to be that guy anymore.

523
00:35:12,881 --> 00:35:14,391
Well who do you want to be, Nathan?

524
00:35:14,754 --> 00:35:17,248
I want to be someone who’s good enough to be seen with you.

525
00:35:18,579 --> 00:35:20,504
Well you should’ve thought of that last night.

526
00:35:20,622 --> 00:35:23,443
You know, I keep putting myself out there, and you keep blowing it,

527
00:35:23,474 --> 00:35:25,424
it’s probably a good thing because at this point there’s nothing

528
00:35:25,471 --> 00:35:27,283
you could say or do that’s gonna surprise me.

529
00:35:32,819 --> 00:35:33,709
Except that.

530
00:35:35,665 --> 00:35:37,032
You shouldn’t have done that, Nathan.

531
00:35:38,441 --> 00:35:39,598
I wanted to.

532
00:35:41,544 --> 00:35:42,240
Yeah.

533
00:36:13,449 --> 00:36:15,323
Have I lost my dining privileges?

534
00:36:16,249 --> 00:36:17,432
Why would you?

535
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:22,942
Oh, because yesterday I popped off about how you should drop everything and go to Italy.

536
00:36:23,023 --> 00:36:24,851
I can be a tad bit pushy.

537
00:36:25,195 --> 00:36:27,631
Actually, I was all set to go.

538
00:36:28,501 --> 00:36:31,948
But then this morning I was going over the numbers and there really is no way

539
00:36:31,989 --> 00:36:34,313
I can afford to shut down for six weeks.

540
00:36:34,744 --> 00:36:36,089
Well then don’t.

541
00:36:37,028 --> 00:36:40,673
- Hire me. I can take over.
- Right…

542
00:36:40,744 --> 00:36:43,801
Well why not? I’ve got the time and the management experience,

543
00:36:43,863 --> 00:36:46,556
and if that’s all that’s keeping you from going.

544
00:36:46,674 --> 00:36:50,136
Deb, be serious. I have two things in my life.

545
00:36:50,279 --> 00:36:52,639
- Lucas and this café.
- I know that.

546
00:36:53,346 --> 00:36:55,711
And because of that you know I take it seriously.

547
00:36:56,761 --> 00:37:01,185
You can walk me through the big stuff today and Haley can help me with the rest.

548
00:37:03,997 --> 00:37:05,728
I can’t. I can’t.

549
00:37:05,921 --> 00:37:09,101
Karen. I’d like to believe we’re friends.

550
00:37:09,387 --> 00:37:13,827
And, I know that’s happened quickly, but it has, and it means a lot to me,

551
00:37:14,456 --> 00:37:18,287
so I’m going to say this and then deny it if it ever gets out.

552
00:37:20,785 --> 00:37:23,464
There are things in my life I would change if I could,

553
00:37:24,149 --> 00:37:26,270
and running from opportunity is one of them.

554
00:37:26,766 --> 00:37:28,113
Go to Italy.

555
00:37:29,567 --> 00:37:30,822
Let me help you go.

556
00:37:32,030 --> 00:37:33,264
Your life is now.

557
00:37:38,113 --> 00:37:39,280
Okay…

558
00:37:41,564 --> 00:37:42,414
Okay.

559
00:37:48,835 --> 00:37:50,084
Are you going to play D?

560
00:37:51,543 --> 00:37:52,120
What?

561
00:37:52,839 --> 00:37:55,481
She aint coming to watch me play, dawg. Mmm-mmm.

562
00:37:59,839 --> 00:38:00,422
Hey.

563
00:38:03,048 --> 00:38:04,002
What’s your name again?

564
00:38:04,647 --> 00:38:05,368
Mouth.

565
00:38:05,767 --> 00:38:08,472
Really? That was my nickname in summer camp.

566
00:38:10,151 --> 00:38:12,440
Because I slept with my mouth open.

567
00:38:13,018 --> 00:38:14,801
Right. Of course…

568
00:38:17,565 --> 00:38:19,614
You know, you’re kind of cute. Do you have a girlfriend?

569
00:38:22,138 --> 00:38:24,057
I’ve got a real knack for hooking people up.

570
00:38:33,731 --> 00:38:35,840
Mmm. What smells so good?

571
00:38:36,777 --> 00:38:38,384
I got takeout from Karen.

572
00:38:42,460 --> 00:38:43,264
What’s all this?

573
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:45,896
I’m going back to work for a while.

574
00:38:47,228 --> 00:38:50,294
Oh. Deb, that’s great. The foundation must be thrilled.

575
00:38:50,381 --> 00:38:52,250
Uh, no, not with the foundation.

576
00:38:52,343 --> 00:38:57,807
Um, I’m going to run the café for Karen while she’s away at cooking school in Italy.

577
00:38:58,267 --> 00:39:02,538
Keith is moving in with Lucas while she’s away and I told Karen...

578
00:39:04,274 --> 00:39:05,795
Oh, um, what are you doing?

579
00:39:05,861 --> 00:39:08,539
I’m looking for the hidden cameras. Because you can not be serious.

580
00:39:09,209 --> 00:39:11,162
Uh, I am, serious.

581
00:39:12,201 --> 00:39:17,387
Karen has had enough taken away from her and if I can give just some tiny part of that back-

582
00:39:17,428 --> 00:39:19,651
And you did all this without discussing it with me first?

583
00:39:20,387 --> 00:39:23,870
The way you discussed all those decisions you made about Nathan with me?

584
00:39:24,243 --> 00:39:25,897
Payback’s an ugly emotion, Deb.

585
00:39:31,106 --> 00:39:33,449
I thought you were going for six weeks.

586
00:39:36,890 --> 00:39:39,415
So, you sure you’re okay with Deb taking over?

587
00:39:39,461 --> 00:39:41,293
Yeah. If it means you get to go.

588
00:39:42,839 --> 00:39:46,204
- Oh. I love you.
- I love you, too.

589
00:39:53,613 --> 00:39:55,098
- You ready to go?
- Yeah.

590
00:39:55,452 --> 00:39:57,858
Great… got a little present for you.

591
00:39:59,743 --> 00:40:02,236
This is all that’s left of my backpacking trip through Europe.

592
00:40:02,563 --> 00:40:04,571
- 10,000 lyre.
- Yep.

593
00:40:04,648 --> 00:40:08,087
It’s only worth about 6 bucks but you can, uh, get yourself a gelato.

594
00:40:12,891 --> 00:40:15,630
Don’t worry. It will all be waiting for you when you get back.

595
00:40:20,864 --> 00:40:23,218
Around six o’clock people get out of work, they want to come by...

596
00:40:23,316 --> 00:40:25,062
- Six o’clock.
- Yeah. That’s when it starts getting really busy.

597
00:40:25,739 --> 00:40:26,987
- I’ll just…
- Yeah.

598
00:40:39,390 --> 00:40:40,797
Bye… Sorry.

599
00:40:46,272 --> 00:40:47,582
What up, Nathan?

600
00:40:54,481 --> 00:40:55,365
Haley!

601
00:41:17,435 --> 00:41:20,286
- Don’t forget to call when you land, okay?
- Alright.

602
00:41:22,973 --> 00:41:25,938
You remember when you said the other night that I had good instincts

603
00:41:26,137 --> 00:41:27,421
and that I should trust them?

604
00:41:28,385 --> 00:41:29,020
Yeah.

605
00:41:36,727 --> 00:41:37,679
You were right.

606
00:41:57,168 --> 00:41:58,017
Hi.

607
00:42:06,363 --> 00:42:07,361
I owe you.

608
00:42:22,138 --> 00:42:24,223
So, been to any bad parties lately?

609
00:42:26,241 --> 00:42:27,882
Come on, I’ll walk you to history.

610
