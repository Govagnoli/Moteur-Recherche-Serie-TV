1
00:00:00,562 --> 00:00:01,890
Previously on One Tree Hill.

2
00:00:01,952 --> 00:00:05,551
Okay, could it get any worse? My love life is non-existent,

3
00:00:05,602 --> 00:00:07,943
my parents are having a yard sale to sell everything we own.

4
00:00:08,014 --> 00:00:10,693
Being poor and horny is no way to go through life.

5
00:00:10,769 --> 00:00:12,890
- I’m Anna. 
- You’re Felix’s sister right?

6
00:00:12,957 --> 00:00:15,347
You know, I was thinking about this whole ‘Friends with Benefits’.

7
00:00:15,408 --> 00:00:17,681
Felix with Brooke. FWB.

8
00:00:17,799 --> 00:00:18,551
Come here.

9
00:00:18,659 --> 00:00:22,806
Dan has a… heart condition known as HCM. It’s a… genetic mutation.

10
00:00:22,867 --> 00:00:24,757
So what do you say boyfriend? Wanna sleep over?

11
00:00:29,315 --> 00:00:32,693
You have any idea how many guys in the room wanna nail your wife right now?

12
00:00:34,727 --> 00:00:37,670
Relax, it’s cool. Peyton and I did a couple lines the other night.

13
00:00:37,854 --> 00:00:38,904
Aint that right Peyton?

14
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:28,380
Someone once said; it’s the good girls who keep diaries.

15
00:01:28,758 --> 00:01:30,700
The bad girls never have the time.

16
00:01:31,733 --> 00:01:34,632
Me… I just wanna live a life I’m gonna remember.

17
00:01:35,213 --> 00:01:36,924
Even if I don’t write it down.

18
00:01:38,363 --> 00:01:41,313
If I’d known your mom was gonna come home, I never would have stayed the night.

19
00:01:41,506 --> 00:01:44,202
I mean, not that I’m complaining but since when do you spend the night?

20
00:01:44,307 --> 00:01:47,872
That was a onetime only bonus for you getting me home from the club. Now come here.

21
00:01:49,136 --> 00:01:50,411
Where the hell is my bed?!

22
00:01:54,118 --> 00:01:59,028
Got a good price on the queen-size. Single bed on its way love mom?!

23
00:02:00,037 --> 00:02:02,146
I still live here, you know!

24
00:02:02,694 --> 00:02:03,457
You know....

25
00:02:04,701 --> 00:02:06,621
we could always shag on the shag.

26
00:02:07,645 --> 00:02:10,973
Moments past Pool Boy. Besides, I have to meet Haley.

27
00:02:18,141 --> 00:02:21,432
Gotta say, good call Nate. Road tripping to Charlotte.

28
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:22,898
Love that NBA expansion.

29
00:02:24,761 --> 00:02:27,347
Third row, floor, right behind the bench.

30
00:02:30,399 --> 00:02:33,219
Anyway, so you take the CD’s that you’re sick of or never should have bought

31
00:02:33,265 --> 00:02:35,243
in the first place and you bring them back and they –

32
00:02:35,298 --> 00:02:36,737
- And they give me cash?
- Yeah.

33
00:02:37,055 --> 00:02:38,652
Maybe I can buy my bed back.

34
00:02:40,091 --> 00:02:42,078
So, Nathan’s going to Charlotte tonight with Lucas

35
00:02:42,184 --> 00:02:44,478
and this is my first night alone in the apartment.

36
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:46,976
Do you know what we should do? We should have a slumber party.

37
00:02:47,058 --> 00:02:49,122
Seriously, we haven’t done that since like, junior high.

38
00:02:49,516 --> 00:02:52,313
I dunno. I haven’t done that since… ever.

39
00:02:52,772 --> 00:02:54,750
- Haley!
- I wasn’t popular in junior high.

40
00:02:54,872 --> 00:02:57,744
No! Then we have to. This is like a rite of passage.

41
00:02:57,847 --> 00:03:00,699
I mean, when did you learn to put on eye shadow and stuff your bra and make out?

42
00:03:00,797 --> 00:03:01,722
I don’t know.

43
00:03:01,861 --> 00:03:03,711
Okay, I’m calling Peyton. This is going to be great.

44
00:03:03,797 --> 00:03:06,126
Well, look I was kinda looking forward to having a night alone in the apartment.

45
00:03:06,208 --> 00:03:09,177
And I was kinda looking forward to being rich but we all adjust don’t we?

46
00:03:11,402 --> 00:03:12,578
- Hey, what’s up?
- Hey.

47
00:03:13,462 --> 00:03:14,497
Alright, what you got?

48
00:03:15,224 --> 00:03:16,032
Here you go.

49
00:03:17,584 --> 00:03:18,260
Alright.

50
00:03:18,793 --> 00:03:22,945
Crap. Crap. Crap. Crap.

51
00:03:24,238 --> 00:03:26,565
Lucky for you, crap sells.

52
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:29,350
D'ya listen to my demo yet?

53
00:03:29,668 --> 00:03:31,455
Um… yeah I did. It’s...

54
00:03:31,515 --> 00:03:35,556
Good; I know. I’m working on this other song I could really use some female vocals on.

55
00:03:35,669 --> 00:03:37,824
Maybe you could come by the studio and lay something down for me.

56
00:03:38,485 --> 00:03:40,447
Track. Lay down the track.

57
00:03:40,610 --> 00:03:41,300
Yeah.

58
00:03:42,985 --> 00:03:45,032
Okay. Yeah… sure.

59
00:03:45,131 --> 00:03:46,856
- That sounds fine. How’s – 
- Tonight.

60
00:03:47,643 --> 00:03:48,935
Let me get you the address.

61
00:03:49,959 --> 00:03:52,371
Hello. Tonight, slumber party.

62
00:03:52,473 --> 00:03:55,028
Oh, I’m sorry. Um… I can say no.

63
00:03:55,227 --> 00:03:57,168
No. It’s fine.

64
00:03:57,269 --> 00:03:58,678
I’ll come over early and set up.

65
00:03:58,770 --> 00:03:59,825
What do you mean ‘set up’?

66
00:04:00,583 --> 00:04:02,436
You have no idea.

67
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:11,100
Oh great.

68
00:04:13,017 --> 00:04:14,380
Hey. You’re awake.

69
00:04:16,871 --> 00:04:19,313
I… saw you were gone. I thought, maybe…

70
00:04:20,064 --> 00:04:21,611
maybe it was a one-night-stand.

71
00:04:26,621 --> 00:04:29,557
But it felt good. You can one-night-stand me anytime.

72
00:04:31,252 --> 00:04:32,071
Where’d you go?

73
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:34,426
Breakfast.

74
00:04:34,682 --> 00:04:37,129
Ohhh. Well how’d you get back in? The door locks.

75
00:04:37,216 --> 00:04:38,681
I jimmied it with a credit card.

76
00:04:38,767 --> 00:04:39,971
I should be afraid, right?

77
00:04:42,475 --> 00:04:44,057
Ahh… chocolate croissants.

78
00:04:44,472 --> 00:04:46,023
Those are actually for me.

79
00:04:46,162 --> 00:04:47,257
Uh, there are two.

80
00:04:47,631 --> 00:04:50,555
I know. Energy bar’s for you.

81
00:04:50,754 --> 00:04:52,951
Trust me you’re gonna need it.

82
00:04:59,346 --> 00:05:02,181
Oh hey! You look beat.

83
00:05:02,275 --> 00:05:05,571
Oh, I was up all night. First college paper.

84
00:05:06,047 --> 00:05:08,367
What are you doing here? Go home. Sleep.

85
00:05:08,439 --> 00:05:10,056
- We need to talk.
- Okay.

86
00:05:10,831 --> 00:05:12,499
Haley told me about the drugs.

87
00:05:18,587 --> 00:05:19,646
Opening night.

88
00:05:20,429 --> 00:05:22,580
This guy Rick was doing coke.

89
00:05:23,748 --> 00:05:26,425
Oh, uh… yeah.

90
00:05:26,668 --> 00:05:28,048
Why didn’t you tell me?

91
00:05:29,016 --> 00:05:31,786
I don’t know. I’m sorry.

92
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:35,900
Look, I know he’s got a lotta music connections and I know how important that is to you.

93
00:05:36,012 --> 00:05:38,810
But I won’t have drugs in my club, Peyton!

94
00:05:38,888 --> 00:05:39,477
Of course.

95
00:05:39,544 --> 00:05:41,669
And I don’t expect you to handle everything on your own…

96
00:05:42,124 --> 00:05:45,961
but you have to come to me if… anything like that ever happens again.

97
00:05:48,106 --> 00:05:49,620
- I will.
- Promise?

98
00:05:50,343 --> 00:05:51,115
I promise.

99
00:05:51,591 --> 00:05:52,161
Good.

100
00:05:55,185 --> 00:05:56,874
You know you can always talk to me, Peyton.

101
00:06:07,642 --> 00:06:09,291
It’s another mechanic stripper!

102
00:06:10,274 --> 00:06:12,050
No… just Lucas.

103
00:06:12,210 --> 00:06:14,074
Okay! Guess we’re off.

104
00:06:14,227 --> 00:06:16,674
Alright! Well go… whoever they are!

105
00:06:16,797 --> 00:06:19,424
- Bobcats Haley.
- Alright, well, I love bobcats. They’re so cute.

106
00:06:19,491 --> 00:06:20,955
- You’re such a girl.
- I know.

107
00:06:22,624 --> 00:06:25,742
Can we go now? You saw her, she’s back, let’s go!

108
00:06:25,803 --> 00:06:29,531
Come on, man! Look, this is the first night we’ve spent apart since we got married.

109
00:06:32,305 --> 00:06:35,455
Well… girls are having a slumber party.

110
00:06:35,541 --> 00:06:36,135
Really?

111
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:38,450
Oh, that’s cool. So you won’t be alone tonight.

112
00:06:38,527 --> 00:06:39,786
- Yep.
- What’re you gonna do until then?

113
00:06:40,718 --> 00:06:43,898
Uh… Probably just gonna… hang out with Brooke.

114
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:45,546
Right Brooke?

115
00:06:46,796 --> 00:06:47,507
Yeah!

116
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:49,735
Just us girls.

117
00:06:57,236 --> 00:07:00,230
So, find anything good in the lost and found?!

118
00:07:00,337 --> 00:07:01,172
Not really!

119
00:07:02,525 --> 00:07:03,247
Okay.

120
00:07:03,675 --> 00:07:06,580
How wasted does one have to be to go home with one shoe.

121
00:07:06,652 --> 00:07:09,841
It’s like, at what point do you look down at your foot and say ‘hmmm’.

122
00:07:09,943 --> 00:07:12,823
Eww, I was thinking the same thing about the two thongs in here.

123
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:14,301
Eww, two thongs?!

124
00:07:14,694 --> 00:07:17,214
Now that is what I call a successful club opening.

125
00:07:20,286 --> 00:07:22,119
- Hello?!
- What’s so funny?

126
00:07:22,215 --> 00:07:24,863
Oh, hey Brooke. Are you missing any underwear?

127
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:25,621
What!?

128
00:07:26,118 --> 00:07:28,974
Nothing. Anna’s just helping me clean out TRIC.

129
00:07:29,097 --> 00:07:30,326
Thanks for the phone call.

130
00:07:30,752 --> 00:07:33,025
What, did you really wanna get up and work this morning?

131
00:07:33,127 --> 00:07:34,170
Okay, good point.

132
00:07:34,279 --> 00:07:37,238
Well, tonight; Haley doesn’t have a husband, I don’t have a bed,

133
00:07:37,341 --> 00:07:38,722
so we’re having a slumber party.

134
00:07:38,843 --> 00:07:40,110
Oh, how retro.

135
00:07:40,205 --> 00:07:43,842
I know! You bring the music and your ouija board, I’m bringing the beauty arsenal.

136
00:07:44,032 --> 00:07:46,127
How about Anna? Can I bring her too?

137
00:07:46,403 --> 00:07:47,776
Whatever. Nine o’clock.

138
00:07:55,445 --> 00:07:56,904
This car runs great, man.

139
00:07:57,723 --> 00:07:59,008
Yeah, not bad right?

140
00:07:59,485 --> 00:08:02,223
The best part is; Dan had nothing to do with it.

141
00:08:04,462 --> 00:08:07,831
- Do need to replace this tape deck though.
- Oh, god, definitely.

142
00:08:08,655 --> 00:08:13,421
But, for now, I got my… trusty IPod and cassette adaptor.

143
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:14,706
Nice! Fire it up.

144
00:08:18,137 --> 00:08:19,770
- It’s stuck.
- What?

145
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:23,027
You telling me you didn’t check the stereo before we left?

146
00:08:23,288 --> 00:08:24,918
I was busy working on the engine.

147
00:08:30,512 --> 00:08:31,608
A holiday,

148
00:08:33,353 --> 00:08:34,413
A holiday

149
00:08:35,263 --> 00:08:36,323
What is this?

150
00:08:36,416 --> 00:08:37,655
Is the best day,

151
00:08:37,726 --> 00:08:38,853
I have no idea.

152
00:08:39,462 --> 00:08:41,075
An ice-cream day,

153
00:08:42,361 --> 00:08:43,993
I am only happy,

154
00:08:45,366 --> 00:08:46,702
When I have,

155
00:08:47,812 --> 00:08:49,031
A holi-

156
00:08:51,443 --> 00:08:54,474
- I thought I was gonna have to fail you.
- I know. It’s been one of those days.

157
00:08:55,042 --> 00:08:55,786
You’re flushed.

158
00:08:55,872 --> 00:08:57,439
Well I ran all the way form the parking lot.

159
00:08:58,044 --> 00:08:59,942
And um… I’m a little nervous.

160
00:09:00,577 --> 00:09:01,377
Bout the paper?

161
00:09:01,713 --> 00:09:02,538
That too.

162
00:09:10,107 --> 00:09:11,881
Well look, the paper’s in now.

163
00:09:11,985 --> 00:09:15,314
So um… how bout dinner tonight? I know this great place.

164
00:09:15,707 --> 00:09:18,559
- And we past the hotdog stage.
- I like the hotdog stage.

165
00:09:18,646 --> 00:09:20,089
I know. That’s why I liked you.

166
00:09:20,834 --> 00:09:22,399
I’m ready for an upgrade if you are.

167
00:09:23,679 --> 00:09:25,086
Okay, tonight.

168
00:09:26,013 --> 00:09:27,493
Good, so it’s a date then.

169
00:09:34,219 --> 00:09:35,194
Where did you come from?

170
00:09:38,123 --> 00:09:38,876
Me?

171
00:09:39,289 --> 00:09:40,116
Yeah.

172
00:09:40,458 --> 00:09:41,097
Durham.

173
00:09:42,342 --> 00:09:44,165
Got a husband and three kids there.

174
00:09:44,256 --> 00:09:45,224
No, I’m serious.

175
00:09:46,391 --> 00:09:47,844
We never talk about you.

176
00:09:48,829 --> 00:09:49,956
What can I say?

177
00:09:50,805 --> 00:09:52,140
I’m from the Midwest,

178
00:09:53,084 --> 00:09:54,666
I like my parents,

179
00:09:55,464 --> 00:09:58,423
I sell real-estate now and again and…

180
00:09:59,085 --> 00:10:01,598
oh, I have terrible taste in guys.

181
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:08,556
There is… one thing you should know about me though.

182
00:10:09,991 --> 00:10:11,204
Very important.

183
00:10:12,987 --> 00:10:13,790
Okay.

184
00:10:15,129 --> 00:10:16,544
I’m starving!

185
00:10:26,190 --> 00:10:27,675
Okay, that’s weird.

186
00:10:28,236 --> 00:10:28,934
Haley?!

187
00:10:32,826 --> 00:10:33,983
Oh my god!

188
00:10:46,495 --> 00:10:49,306
Okay, I think you should know I have a bat.

189
00:10:49,666 --> 00:10:51,559
And, we dialled 911.

190
00:10:53,608 --> 00:10:54,724
Yeah, that too.

191
00:11:05,721 --> 00:11:08,132
Okay, on the count of three.

192
00:11:08,926 --> 00:11:11,636
One… two… three!

193
00:11:14,864 --> 00:11:16,075
- Brooke!
- Peyton!

194
00:11:16,167 --> 00:11:19,428
- Anna!
- Argh, my eyes! I’m blind!

195
00:11:31,445 --> 00:11:33,462
Hey, I’m looking for Karen.

196
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:34,481
That’s me.

197
00:11:36,032 --> 00:11:38,797
- You’re Rick.
- Yeah, what can I do for you?

198
00:11:40,206 --> 00:11:42,033
You could stay the hell away from TRIC.

199
00:11:43,063 --> 00:11:44,322
You’re not welcome here.

200
00:11:45,048 --> 00:11:46,927
I won’t have drugs in my club.

201
00:11:47,010 --> 00:11:49,028
Yeah, well you won’t have any customers either.

202
00:11:50,118 --> 00:11:52,155
I control every major band on this circuit.

203
00:11:52,718 --> 00:11:54,853
You cut me off, you’re cutting off your talent.

204
00:11:54,930 --> 00:11:56,005
We’ll be fine!

205
00:11:56,507 --> 00:12:00,178
And by the way, the place was full of kids. What’s wrong with you?

206
00:12:02,621 --> 00:12:03,962
Dumb move lady.

207
00:12:05,857 --> 00:12:08,442
Actually, it’s the smartest move I’ve made all day.

208
00:12:14,645 --> 00:12:18,632
What do you want from me? Okay, I have no bed and rope burns are so last season.

209
00:12:18,712 --> 00:12:23,106
I don’t know Brooke; backseats, hot tubs, closets. You’ve never had a problem before.

210
00:12:23,192 --> 00:12:24,819
We were horny okay?

211
00:12:26,007 --> 00:12:28,104
Just promise me you won’t tell Haley.

212
00:12:28,186 --> 00:12:30,883
- You are so washing the sheets.
- Yeah!

213
00:12:31,672 --> 00:12:37,228
- Okay, who saw me naked?
- I said ew! Sister in the room, hello!

214
00:12:38,539 --> 00:12:42,450
Huh, hey, is this gonna work for me? You know, coz I got that combination skin.

215
00:12:42,542 --> 00:12:44,247
You have to go! Go!

216
00:12:44,345 --> 00:12:47,180
Hey, whatever you say. Just give me a second to get my stuff.

217
00:12:52,097 --> 00:12:55,747
Hi! I’m Brooke. We haven’t officially been introduced…

218
00:12:55,849 --> 00:12:58,793
but you’re dating my ex boyfriend and I’m sleeping with your brother

219
00:12:58,879 --> 00:13:01,762
- so it looks like we have a lot in common.
- Yeah.

220
00:13:02,029 --> 00:13:02,660
Brooke!

221
00:13:02,756 --> 00:13:04,738
Oh, and you’re Peyton’s new best friend.

222
00:13:05,627 --> 00:13:07,574
Sorry, I forgot that part.

223
00:13:11,675 --> 00:13:13,058
Is that the shower?

224
00:13:14,004 --> 00:13:15,162
Unbelievable!

225
00:13:15,426 --> 00:13:19,135
Oo, that water is hot and so is Felix,

226
00:13:19,974 --> 00:13:23,021
Oo, the water is wet and so is –

227
00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:35,955
Dancing when the stars go blue,

228
00:13:36,374 --> 00:13:41,024
Dancing where the evening fell,

229
00:13:41,571 --> 00:13:45,822
Dancing in my wooden shoes,

230
00:13:45,949 --> 00:13:48,642
- In a wedding go –
- Alright Haley, hold up.

231
00:13:49,133 --> 00:13:50,270
I’m just not feeling it.

232
00:13:51,146 --> 00:13:52,498
Hold up a second okay?

233
00:13:55,319 --> 00:13:56,634
Alright Haley, listen.

234
00:13:57,396 --> 00:13:59,568
A lot of girls can see on-key okay?

235
00:14:00,029 --> 00:14:02,032
I’m gonna need something a little bit more from you alright?

236
00:14:02,113 --> 00:14:05,338
Something… a bit further south than your brain. You know what I saying?

237
00:14:05,426 --> 00:14:09,251
Listen, it’s not about technique. It’s about giving me something of yourself.

238
00:14:09,369 --> 00:14:11,350
Something that no one else gets to see.

239
00:14:12,379 --> 00:14:14,724
You can’t play it safe in here Haley, I’m not gonna let you.

240
00:14:14,813 --> 00:14:16,521
- Okay, well, I’m trying.
- No you’re not!

241
00:14:16,603 --> 00:14:19,164
- Yes I am!
- No you’re not, you’re really close to something.

242
00:14:19,251 --> 00:14:22,374
You know, and you’ve got the talent but for some reason, you won’t go there.

243
00:14:24,001 --> 00:14:28,119
If you won’t go there, maybe you’re just wasting my time.

244
00:14:33,117 --> 00:14:33,766
Okay.

245
00:14:34,667 --> 00:14:35,451
Come here.

246
00:14:37,616 --> 00:14:40,289
Play it back. Put me in this time.

247
00:14:41,896 --> 00:14:43,208
Just follow along okay?

248
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:44,721
Okay

249
00:14:49,706 --> 00:14:53,847
Laughing with your pretty mouth,

250
00:14:54,107 --> 00:14:58,751
- Try this one now.
- Laughing with your broken eyes,

251
00:14:58,895 --> 00:15:04,117
Okay, yeah. 
Laughing with your lovers song,

252
00:15:04,307 --> 00:15:07,932
In a lullaby,

253
00:15:08,924 --> 00:15:10,471
Alright, now sing with me on this one Hale.

254
00:15:11,582 --> 00:15:15,766
Where do you go when you’re lonely,

255
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:20,987
Where do you go when you’re blue.

256
00:15:22,003 --> 00:15:26,036
Where do you go when you’re lonely,

257
00:15:27,085 --> 00:15:32,011
Where do you go when you’re blue,

258
00:15:32,207 --> 00:15:37,869
Where do you go when you’re lonely,
I’ll follow you,

259
00:15:38,145 --> 00:15:41,075
Follow you...

260
00:15:53,577 --> 00:15:55,715
What the hell is Felix doing in there?

261
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:57,252
I dunno. Shaving?

262
00:15:57,346 --> 00:16:00,156
What, his legs? He’s been in there forever.

263
00:16:00,239 --> 00:16:02,681
Yeah, cos your look is so wash and go.

264
00:16:04,996 --> 00:16:07,371
- Hey you guys.
- Oh! Haley!

265
00:16:07,468 --> 00:16:08,072
Hi.

266
00:16:08,189 --> 00:16:08,932
Smells good.

267
00:16:09,096 --> 00:16:09,972
Where you been?

268
00:16:10,304 --> 00:16:12,081
Nowhere, I’m just gonna go take a shower.

269
00:16:13,372 --> 00:16:14,098
Haley?!

270
00:16:17,008 --> 00:16:17,790
What?

271
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:25,823
Ahh… I love slumber parties.

272
00:16:35,073 --> 00:16:37,471
I’m not always late. I promise.

273
00:16:37,542 --> 00:16:39,565
No worries. You’re worth the wait.

274
00:16:39,636 --> 00:16:40,410
Thank you.

275
00:16:42,863 --> 00:16:43,728
Keith!

276
00:16:45,807 --> 00:16:46,672
Karen.

277
00:16:51,714 --> 00:16:52,917
- Hi.
- Hi.

278
00:16:56,501 --> 00:16:59,231
So… this sucks, huh?

279
00:17:01,313 --> 00:17:03,072
What the hell, I got first round.

280
00:17:03,181 --> 00:17:04,485
- Drinks?
- Yes!

281
00:17:06,809 --> 00:17:07,710
Yeah.

282
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:14,529
Charlotte Bobcats, here we come.

283
00:18:08,844 --> 00:18:10,138
That could be you someday.

284
00:18:10,692 --> 00:18:14,153
Well… actually, it could be me. You’re not good enough.

285
00:18:20,108 --> 00:18:21,213
D’you see that?!

286
00:18:30,118 --> 00:18:33,911
You know, I’m just not clear on this. So the shower at your house is broken

287
00:18:34,029 --> 00:18:36,840
and you had to have Felix come all the way over here and use mine?

288
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:39,737
Brooke!

289
00:18:42,357 --> 00:18:45,332
Wait a second. You don’t have a bed do you?

290
00:18:45,467 --> 00:18:49,169
Did you… Tell me you didn’t have sex in my bed. Brooke.

291
00:18:49,732 --> 00:18:53,049
- I’m already washing your sheets.
- Oh my god! Eurgh! Brooke! Eurgh!

292
00:18:53,168 --> 00:18:55,098
They already yelled at me, what is the big deal?!

293
00:18:55,191 --> 00:18:58,319
The big deal is that first of all; you did not thank me for helping you with the CDs.

294
00:18:58,431 --> 00:19:02,793
Second of all; you had sex in my bed! And third; you ate all the brownies.

295
00:19:02,895 --> 00:19:05,318
- Actually, I had a couple.
- That’s not the point.

296
00:19:06,207 --> 00:19:09,014
Haley’s right. The point id that I’ve been deceptive.

297
00:19:09,117 --> 00:19:12,028
It’s not so much that… I lied to anyone’s face.

298
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:14,206
It’s more about what I didn’t say.

299
00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:20,187
Urgh! Okay. There is a big difference between a lie and a little white lie.

300
00:19:20,350 --> 00:19:21,251
- Really!
- Yeah!

301
00:19:21,390 --> 00:19:23,520
- Okay, wait, what white lie?
- Nothing!

302
00:19:23,664 --> 00:19:25,644
- Haley lied to Nathan!
- Not exactly!

303
00:19:25,741 --> 00:19:27,128
- Yes you did!
- About what?!

304
00:19:27,252 --> 00:19:28,393
- Nothing.
- Haley.

305
00:19:28,501 --> 00:19:32,245
You know what, if we’re talking about bad behaviour, you might wanna sit this one out!

306
00:19:32,582 --> 00:19:34,246
What is that supposed to mean?

307
00:19:34,333 --> 00:19:36,724
That’s supposed to mean that Peyton’s the one you should be looking at, not me.

308
00:19:36,801 --> 00:19:39,882
Why?! She not the one acting like a perfect-little-Stepford-wife!

309
00:19:39,981 --> 00:19:43,128
Why are you picking on Haley? She’s throwing us a slumber party.

310
00:19:43,232 --> 00:19:47,072
Actually, she was throwing us a slumber party, you just butted in!

311
00:19:47,165 --> 00:19:48,618
- Brooke! Leave her alone!
- Why!?

312
00:19:48,689 --> 00:19:49,944
What’re you gonna do? Snort her?

313
00:19:50,051 --> 00:19:53,652
Listen, I didn’t throw this slumber party for you, you threw it for yourself and you know it!

314
00:19:53,739 --> 00:19:58,653
Well, at least I didn’t lie to my husband about hanging out with Chris!

315
00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:01,433
Brooke, well… Peyton did cocaine with that Rick guy.

316
00:20:01,499 --> 00:20:02,339
- Haley!
- What?!

317
00:20:02,432 --> 00:20:04,613
- You had sex in her bed!
- Okay...

318
00:20:04,690 --> 00:20:06,671
What is wrong with you!? Crack whore!

319
00:20:06,779 --> 00:20:07,471
Slut!

320
00:20:07,756 --> 00:20:08,468
Liar!

321
00:20:11,081 --> 00:20:14,178
Man, Tree Hill’s got some drama.

322
00:20:20,788 --> 00:20:23,363
- That was awesome.
- Yeah. It was man.

323
00:20:24,338 --> 00:20:28,160
You know, if you want to drive back tonight man, I’m so wired I’m not gonna go to sleep for hours.

324
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:29,911
No, nah it’s cool.

325
00:20:30,279 --> 00:20:32,716
Oh come on. You can see Hales, I can…

326
00:20:33,397 --> 00:20:34,786
crash the slumber party.

327
00:20:35,333 --> 00:20:37,310
Nah, we can’t. Gotta stay the night.

328
00:20:38,595 --> 00:20:41,606
Okay. Why?

329
00:20:41,704 --> 00:20:43,178
This trip wasn’t just about the game.

330
00:20:44,672 --> 00:20:45,773
There’s something else.

331
00:20:54,539 --> 00:20:55,798
Sorry about dinner.

332
00:20:56,029 --> 00:20:59,817
Oh please. I’m hoping to break bread with all your ex boyfriends.

333
00:21:00,877 --> 00:21:02,392
He wasn’t my boyfriend.

334
00:21:03,745 --> 00:21:06,431
And yet he asked you to marry him. Interesting.

335
00:21:06,842 --> 00:21:08,936
- Seems like a nice guy though.
- He is.

336
00:21:14,287 --> 00:21:16,749
- You like?
- What’s not to like?

337
00:21:17,712 --> 00:21:19,406
You know, I have this print too.

338
00:21:21,501 --> 00:21:22,561
It’s not a print.

339
00:21:27,788 --> 00:21:29,974
Well, I feel like I’m back in Italy.

340
00:21:30,092 --> 00:21:30,820
Yeah.

341
00:21:31,864 --> 00:21:33,471
I have a house there too. You wanna go?

342
00:21:33,847 --> 00:21:35,053
I could blow off school for a week.

343
00:21:36,430 --> 00:21:37,588
Or not!

344
00:21:38,873 --> 00:21:41,387
- Is it my company?
- Oh, no, god it’s the paper.

345
00:21:41,555 --> 00:21:43,574
I… kinda pulled an all-nighter.

346
00:21:43,697 --> 00:21:44,946
Spoken like a true co-ed.

347
00:21:46,763 --> 00:21:48,770
Since you mentioned it though, come here.

348
00:21:56,303 --> 00:21:58,289
Let’s just take care of this right now shall we?

349
00:21:58,636 --> 00:21:59,670
Oh boy!

350
00:22:02,133 --> 00:22:04,391
Let’s see... right.

351
00:22:14,728 --> 00:22:15,896
Congratulations.

352
00:22:23,447 --> 00:22:26,755
You need more wine. Stay put, get comfortable.

353
00:22:27,335 --> 00:22:29,152
You know, I think I should probably go.

354
00:22:31,323 --> 00:22:32,091
Why?

355
00:22:35,514 --> 00:22:36,523
I just…

356
00:22:41,773 --> 00:22:42,648
Karen!

357
00:22:45,341 --> 00:22:46,852
You know about Dan’s heart condition.

358
00:22:47,497 --> 00:22:50,134
It’s called HCM and it’s genetic.

359
00:22:51,578 --> 00:22:53,508
- Which means we might have it.
- Yeah.

360
00:22:53,862 --> 00:22:57,175
This is serious Luke. It’s common among athletes too.

361
00:22:59,503 --> 00:23:00,446
What do we do?

362
00:23:00,994 --> 00:23:03,600
Well, first of all; if we have it, that’s it for basketball.

363
00:23:04,312 --> 00:23:05,734
Or any sport really.

364
00:23:06,570 --> 00:23:08,279
But what does this have to do with Charlotte?

365
00:23:08,571 --> 00:23:10,440
Well the test costs a thousand bucks.

366
00:23:11,028 --> 00:23:14,455
There’s a hospital here that does free student-athlete screenings once a month.

367
00:23:15,863 --> 00:23:16,917
And that’s tomorrow.

368
00:23:17,573 --> 00:23:19,201
And why didn’t you tell me about this upfront?

369
00:23:19,487 --> 00:23:22,498
I dunno, I… I didn’t wanna ruin it;

370
00:23:22,775 --> 00:23:25,821
the game, the road trip… us hanging out.

371
00:23:29,251 --> 00:23:30,925
We have appointments tomorrow morning.

372
00:23:31,037 --> 00:23:33,337
Ah, come on man, what are the odds of us even having this thing anyway?

373
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:35,875
Fifty-fifty.

374
00:23:39,166 --> 00:23:40,469
One in two.

375
00:24:09,037 --> 00:24:11,989
I’m sorry I freaked out on you about the bed. At least I have one.

376
00:24:13,749 --> 00:24:15,480
I’m sorry I called you a liar.

377
00:24:16,392 --> 00:24:20,483
- You fibbed to Nathan; it’s not a big deal.
- No, it is a big deal.

378
00:24:22,516 --> 00:24:25,443
Okay, cease fire! Girl talk.

379
00:24:30,607 --> 00:24:31,475
Come on.

380
00:24:32,596 --> 00:24:35,602
I should have told Nathan that I was gonna be with Chris and I don’t know why I didn’t

381
00:24:35,668 --> 00:24:39,958
cos, like, the words started coming out of my mouth and then it was just… too late to take it back.

382
00:24:40,016 --> 00:24:42,278
Okay, you don’t have feeling for Chris, do you?

383
00:24:43,829 --> 00:24:46,902
No. It’s just the first time I’ve ever wanted something for me.

384
00:24:46,958 --> 00:24:49,205
It’s not for my parents, it’s not for Nathan, it’s just... for me

385
00:24:49,272 --> 00:24:51,801
and Chris can… help me get it.

386
00:24:52,743 --> 00:24:54,910
- So… what’s wrong with that?
- Exactly!

387
00:24:54,981 --> 00:24:57,587
I don’t know why I should feel embarrassed for saying

388
00:24:57,654 --> 00:25:00,213
that I know what I want and I’m gonna go after it like…

389
00:25:01,146 --> 00:25:02,308
Like a guy.

390
00:25:04,991 --> 00:25:08,544
Nathan never apologises or… or lies for what he wants. I mean…

391
00:25:09,809 --> 00:25:11,494
I don’t know why I feel like I had to.

392
00:25:11,595 --> 00:25:15,871
Haley, trust me, you can go after what you want and still be a girl.

393
00:25:15,968 --> 00:25:20,012
I know. I totally know and that why this is so stupid!

394
00:25:22,517 --> 00:25:24,156
On the topic of stupid,

395
00:25:26,955 --> 00:25:30,258
- cocaine, P. Sawyer?
- I’m an idiot.

396
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:34,406
- Well you’re not gonna do it again, right?
- No! No.

397
00:25:34,537 --> 00:25:38,589
Um… I don’t want to. But…

398
00:25:43,407 --> 00:25:44,947
I’m not going to.

399
00:25:45,506 --> 00:25:46,370
Okay.

400
00:25:50,416 --> 00:25:53,565
I’m really sorry. Sorry I just blurted that out. I…

401
00:25:54,246 --> 00:25:56,811
I should have talked to you about it at the club but I just…

402
00:25:57,195 --> 00:25:58,643
I just didn’t wanna handle it.

403
00:25:58,726 --> 00:26:02,037
No. It’s… It’s my fault.

404
00:26:02,565 --> 00:26:08,403
But I just… really want us all to be… good enough friends that we can talk about stuff.

405
00:26:08,796 --> 00:26:12,033
You know? Even when it’s ugly…

406
00:26:13,108 --> 00:26:14,282
especially then.

407
00:26:27,532 --> 00:26:31,714
So just like that? Get the test, find out we can never play again.

408
00:26:31,776 --> 00:26:32,579
Yep.

409
00:26:34,945 --> 00:26:35,698
What?

410
00:26:36,117 --> 00:26:37,540
It’s just Dan! You know?!

411
00:26:37,983 --> 00:26:41,146
Oh, tell me about it. I can emancipate myself all I want

412
00:26:41,237 --> 00:26:43,653
but… the guy still finds a way to control my life.

413
00:26:44,945 --> 00:26:47,863
- Hey, Emeka, you played a great game man.
- Thanks.

414
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:52,220
So, how does it feel to be out there? You know, finally making it to the league.

415
00:26:53,060 --> 00:26:56,557
It was a dream-come-true. What I was born to do. You guys play?

416
00:26:57,494 --> 00:26:58,287
Yeah.

417
00:26:59,573 --> 00:27:00,427
We love it.

418
00:27:00,576 --> 00:27:02,834
You gotta bulk up a little bit if you wanna play in the league.

419
00:27:03,203 --> 00:27:04,221
Yeah, he’s skinny.

420
00:27:04,986 --> 00:27:06,171
You too.

421
00:27:08,337 --> 00:27:09,485
Yeah, well he’s got no left.

422
00:27:10,632 --> 00:27:12,199
- You got no range.
- What?!

423
00:27:12,808 --> 00:27:14,452
Please tell me you guys aren’t team mates.

424
00:27:15,757 --> 00:27:17,442
Nah, it’s worse; we’re brothers.

425
00:27:18,024 --> 00:27:21,962
Right, well, you guys… roll strong and hit those weights.

426
00:27:22,043 --> 00:27:22,869
Thanks man.

427
00:27:25,532 --> 00:27:29,954
Okay, so… are we going to talk about your little ‘arrangement’ with Felix?

428
00:27:30,046 --> 00:27:31,619
The ‘Friends with Benefits’ thing.

429
00:27:31,824 --> 00:27:34,603
Do we have to? It’s kinda foul.

430
00:27:34,773 --> 00:27:39,192
What’s foul about it? I mean, besides… Haley’s linens.

431
00:27:40,774 --> 00:27:42,248
- Come on!
- Sorry!

432
00:27:42,366 --> 00:27:46,420
No. But seriously, like, I know you’re gonna give me your whole…

433
00:27:46,510 --> 00:27:50,573
‘I can have sex like a guy’ speech but… its crap.

434
00:27:50,743 --> 00:27:53,071
Why? You think I’m gonna let myself get hurt again?

435
00:27:53,169 --> 00:27:54,259
I dunno, maybe.

436
00:27:54,634 --> 00:27:56,569
At least I’m having sex. I d-

437
00:27:56,717 --> 00:28:00,915
Yeah, with a guy that doesn’t even respect you enough to have a real relationship with you.

438
00:28:01,002 --> 00:28:06,004
Anna, I’m… I’m really sorry, okay, but everything is on Felix’s terms.

439
00:28:06,097 --> 00:28:09,569
- I gave him the Writer so they’re my terms.
- But it was his idea!

440
00:28:09,728 --> 00:28:14,473
- Brooke? Don’t you wanna fall in love?
- Yeah, I do. Some day, okay?

441
00:28:15,196 --> 00:28:16,343
Why not now?

442
00:28:18,554 --> 00:28:21,252
Look, Tutor Wife, I love you but if it was up to you,

443
00:28:21,319 --> 00:28:24,068
we’d all be getting our marriage licence with our drivers licence and I-

444
00:28:24,181 --> 00:28:28,236
I’m not talking about marriage. I’m just talking about… falling in love.

445
00:28:28,313 --> 00:28:31,948
And I’m tired of feeling bad! Okay?

446
00:28:32,051 --> 00:28:35,097
I’d rather feel nothing. It’s… better, it’s easier.

447
00:28:35,174 --> 00:28:40,252
No. It is not better Brooke! Like… it’s not you!

448
00:28:40,443 --> 00:28:44,169
Okay, I admire you so much for the chances you take

449
00:28:44,251 --> 00:28:46,668
but… this just doesn’t seem like you.

450
00:28:47,661 --> 00:28:51,015
- It’s less than you.
- It’s just about sex-

451
00:28:51,097 --> 00:28:55,842
Okay, we both know… sex is never just sex.

452
00:28:55,916 --> 00:28:59,361
I love my brother but there is a double standard for girls and there always will be.

453
00:28:59,459 --> 00:29:01,680
Yeah, and I’m saying screw the double standard!

454
00:29:01,778 --> 00:29:03,488
That’s good Brooke. You should say it.

455
00:29:03,601 --> 00:29:08,193
And so should I and every other girl who is tired of playing their game… by their rules.

456
00:29:08,372 --> 00:29:12,207
Don’t be too fat… or too thin or too… dark

457
00:29:12,301 --> 00:29:15,761
or too light… don’t be too sexual or too chased

458
00:29:15,827 --> 00:29:17,610
or too smart or too dumb!

459
00:29:17,869 --> 00:29:20,471
Be yourself. But make sure you fit in.

460
00:29:35,570 --> 00:29:38,252
- Hello?
- Whatever I did, I’m sorry.

461
00:29:39,324 --> 00:29:43,026
Look, Andy, I’m exhausted and I don’t wanna say something I might regret.

462
00:29:43,163 --> 00:29:45,385
Obviously I already have. Let me come over.

463
00:29:45,467 --> 00:29:49,583
No! It’s late and by the time you get here… No.

464
00:29:57,403 --> 00:30:01,350
Now I’ve been trying to figure out what happened and, I’ve narrowed it down to, like, this paper or…

465
00:30:01,426 --> 00:30:04,448
I don’t know; you’re psychotic or something. And I don’t think you’re psychotic.

466
00:30:05,825 --> 00:30:08,815
You didn’t even read it and you gave me an ‘A’! In your bedroom!

467
00:30:08,891 --> 00:30:09,570
I did read it.

468
00:30:09,645 --> 00:30:11,222
Then you should know it doesn’t deserve an ‘A’!

469
00:30:11,303 --> 00:30:14,175
I mean, I banged this out in one night; it is practically my first draft!

470
00:30:14,251 --> 00:30:18,325
- Karen!
- Look, Andy, this is important to me!

471
00:30:18,742 --> 00:30:20,095
Going to school,

472
00:30:21,307 --> 00:30:25,685
and I have to know that I can do this and I’m not gonna compromise it by seeing you. I can’t!

473
00:30:25,869 --> 00:30:27,836
Your paper is good Karen!

474
00:30:28,143 --> 00:30:31,825
And you instincts are great! Okay, so maybe you haven’t memorised every stupid text book principle

475
00:30:31,875 --> 00:30:35,829
but you already… have two successful businesses up and running, right now.

476
00:30:35,906 --> 00:30:38,097
Yeah, but I was rushed, I was distracted!

477
00:30:38,173 --> 00:30:40,272
Okay, so maybe it isn’t gonna be as hard as you think.

478
00:30:40,477 --> 00:30:44,746
Maybe being a mom and a business woman has prepared you for this in ways that you don’t even recognise.

479
00:30:44,819 --> 00:30:48,106
And maybe… maybe you just need to have a bit more confidence.

480
00:30:50,441 --> 00:30:52,596
In yourself… and in me.

481
00:30:56,032 --> 00:30:59,033
Now I’ll have one of my colleagues grade that paper if that’s what you want.

482
00:30:59,437 --> 00:31:01,162
But you deserve that ‘A’ Karen.

483
00:31:02,606 --> 00:31:05,023
And I know how important that is to you, I know.

484
00:31:05,893 --> 00:31:08,433
I would never do anything to compromise that.

485
00:31:16,010 --> 00:31:18,392
- Lucas home?
- No, he’s in Charlotte for the night.

486
00:31:19,752 --> 00:31:22,476
- Where’s this print of yours?
- It’s in my bedroom, it’s in my bedroom.

487
00:31:26,664 --> 00:31:27,848
Some night, huh?

488
00:31:28,228 --> 00:31:29,818
It was pretty great wasn’t it?

489
00:31:29,978 --> 00:31:31,298
No, it was awful.

490
00:31:33,204 --> 00:31:35,723
But… somehow, with you it wasn’t so awful.

491
00:31:36,126 --> 00:31:38,022
Aw, you’re such a sweetie.

492
00:31:38,838 --> 00:31:42,915
I just… I feel so much better… lighter somehow.

493
00:31:42,988 --> 00:31:45,086
Good. Cos you’re gonna need room…

494
00:31:45,507 --> 00:31:48,446
for my strawberry ice-cream and coco pebbles.

495
00:31:48,619 --> 00:31:49,458
Yikes.

496
00:31:52,193 --> 00:31:56,715
Okay, I’ve never had a problem that ice-cream couldn’t solve, and I’ve had some problems.

497
00:31:57,533 --> 00:32:02,945
Okay, I’ve never had a slumber party so I’m gonna say this sob-fest is over!

498
00:32:03,027 --> 00:32:04,256
Alright, we’ll see, what d’ya wanna do?

499
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:06,176
Pillow fight!

500
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:08,224
Oh, it is on now!

501
00:32:20,973 --> 00:32:22,253
Oh, my head!

502
00:32:26,642 --> 00:32:28,535
Oh my… god!

503
00:32:42,585 --> 00:32:43,491
Sleeping?

504
00:32:44,371 --> 00:32:45,191
No.

505
00:32:46,911 --> 00:32:48,309
I keep thinking about Haley.

506
00:32:50,158 --> 00:32:51,898
She must be scared about all this.

507
00:32:53,736 --> 00:32:55,081
I haven’t told her yet.

508
00:32:57,801 --> 00:33:00,597
Till I get the test results and figure out what I’m gonna do…

509
00:33:01,231 --> 00:33:02,389
I wanna protect her.

510
00:33:02,742 --> 00:33:04,514
She’ll probably be pissed about that but…

511
00:33:05,302 --> 00:33:06,675
I think it’s for the best.

512
00:33:16,310 --> 00:33:19,183
We’ll do this first, then you go for the blood test. Just relax.

513
00:33:20,450 --> 00:33:21,472
You okay?

514
00:33:21,958 --> 00:33:23,177
Yeah, you?

515
00:33:23,811 --> 00:33:27,042
Yeah, just… thinking about my life.

516
00:33:27,375 --> 00:33:29,684
Basketball’s such a… big part Nate. I…

517
00:33:31,706 --> 00:33:33,084
I don’t wanna give it up.

518
00:33:34,327 --> 00:33:36,366
I felt the same way before I got married.

519
00:33:38,056 --> 00:33:41,676
Basketball was the most important thing to me… it was the only thing.

520
00:33:42,509 --> 00:33:43,617
But now Haley is.

521
00:33:45,121 --> 00:33:46,748
And I owe it to her to find out.

522
00:33:47,733 --> 00:33:49,176
Okay, go ahead and lie back.

523
00:33:50,001 --> 00:33:50,821
You’re next.

524
00:34:00,532 --> 00:34:01,633
I’m sorry…

525
00:34:02,657 --> 00:34:03,891
I don’t wanna know.

526
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:25,391
It’s a big risk, Luke, not taking this test. You know the odds.

527
00:34:26,266 --> 00:34:28,867
And what about the risk of never feeling alive again?

528
00:34:28,953 --> 00:34:30,935
As opposed to never being alive again?

529
00:34:33,874 --> 00:34:36,475
There’s more to life than sports. Trust me.

530
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:40,929
After my accident I promised myself… I wouldn’t be afraid anymore.

531
00:34:42,794 --> 00:34:43,535
Of dying?

532
00:34:45,768 --> 00:34:48,035
Yeah! Dying…

533
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:50,114
living too.

534
00:35:04,154 --> 00:35:06,366
Oh! I’m sorry.

535
00:35:06,785 --> 00:35:09,090
I’m not used to having someone else in my bed.

536
00:35:11,931 --> 00:35:12,709
Sleep well?

537
00:35:13,406 --> 00:35:14,405
Like a baby.

538
00:35:19,540 --> 00:35:20,379
What?

539
00:35:20,592 --> 00:35:24,676
I dunno, you just… you seemed more attractive last night.

540
00:35:24,916 --> 00:35:26,057
Huh, must have been the wine.

541
00:35:26,734 --> 00:35:28,183
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

542
00:35:28,279 --> 00:35:29,497
That’s too bad, you’re stuck with me.

543
00:35:29,731 --> 00:35:31,818
No, oh. Oh I hope so!

544
00:35:46,299 --> 00:35:48,340
Okay, stop thief.

545
00:35:50,188 --> 00:35:54,274
A thief break in to steal, I break in with treats.

546
00:35:55,503 --> 00:35:58,279
Well… I’ve got something for you too.

547
00:35:58,846 --> 00:36:00,085
I’m training you well.

548
00:36:07,796 --> 00:36:08,809
Wow, a key.

549
00:36:08,969 --> 00:36:13,540
You can use it to come see me, or… burgle the place, whatever.

550
00:36:14,789 --> 00:36:15,907
Big step!

551
00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:18,292
Oh well, it doesn’t have to mean anything.

552
00:36:18,569 --> 00:36:23,299
But it’ll keep my landlord from asking about the hot cat burglar who comes and goes.

553
00:36:23,592 --> 00:36:24,589
So to speak.

554
00:36:40,787 --> 00:36:43,560
Oh… my gosh!

555
00:36:44,599 --> 00:36:47,746
Urgh! Do you think there’s such a thing as a sugar hangover?

556
00:36:49,965 --> 00:36:53,200
I think what you need is a little taste of the snake that bit ya!

557
00:36:54,308 --> 00:36:56,857
- Ice-cream for breakfast?
- It’s Butter-pecan.

558
00:36:57,589 --> 00:36:58,448
Alright.

559
00:37:01,726 --> 00:37:04,879
So… weird night, huh?

560
00:37:05,540 --> 00:37:07,803
Actually… it was fun.

561
00:37:08,965 --> 00:37:10,492
Thanks for inviting me Peyton.

562
00:37:11,689 --> 00:37:14,899
I was really worried about not making any friends here, but…

563
00:37:15,345 --> 00:37:17,735
I think… I might have made some good ones.

564
00:37:20,164 --> 00:37:22,318
And, if you ever need someone to talk to...

565
00:37:22,856 --> 00:37:25,200
Thanks Anna. I’m glad you came.

566
00:37:29,001 --> 00:37:30,166
So, neighbour girl…

567
00:37:31,762 --> 00:37:34,509
Looks like we have a few things in common after all.

568
00:37:35,027 --> 00:37:36,987
I’m sorry I was kind of a witch before.

569
00:37:37,163 --> 00:37:41,063
It’s okay. It’s hard to let new people in sometimes. I’m used to it.

570
00:37:41,144 --> 00:37:45,103
Well, don’t get too used to it. You’re with us now.

571
00:37:54,349 --> 00:37:55,173
You’re a mess!

572
00:37:59,177 --> 00:38:03,028
I know you don’t understand what I’m doing, but I need to ask you a favour.

573
00:38:04,799 --> 00:38:05,563
Okay.

574
00:38:07,425 --> 00:38:10,953
If my mom ever asks, I got the test and I’m fine…

575
00:38:11,506 --> 00:38:13,661
and the same goes for Haley, alright?

576
00:38:15,633 --> 00:38:16,918
If that’s what you want.

577
00:38:18,290 --> 00:38:19,356
Thanks.

578
00:38:26,293 --> 00:38:27,143
Holiday,

579
00:38:29,227 --> 00:38:30,307
Holiday,

580
00:38:32,212 --> 00:38:33,973
It’s the best day,

581
00:38:35,331 --> 00:38:37,306
It’s an ice-cream day,

582
00:38:38,402 --> 00:38:40,149
I am only happy,

583
00:38:41,223 --> 00:38:42,322
When I have,

584
00:38:43,926 --> 00:38:46,594
Holiday, holiday, holiday...

585
00:38:54,906 --> 00:38:58,509
Saturday, nine thirty-two p.m.

586
00:38:58,607 --> 00:39:01,146
Hey, TRIC, we need to talk.

587
00:39:01,954 --> 00:39:03,598
End of messages.

588
00:39:10,203 --> 00:39:14,017
Where do you go when you’re lonely,

589
00:39:15,241 --> 00:39:19,716
Where do you go when you’re blue,

590
00:39:23,505 --> 00:39:24,559
My husband!

591
00:39:24,718 --> 00:39:26,710
Hey. What was that?

592
00:39:27,036 --> 00:39:29,593
Oh, just a works in progress. I don’t want you to hear it yet.

593
00:39:30,104 --> 00:39:30,826
Okay.

594
00:39:31,163 --> 00:39:32,741
Well? Did you have fun with Lucas?

595
00:39:33,607 --> 00:39:35,727
- Yeah! Yeah, we had a great time.
- Good.

596
00:39:35,788 --> 00:39:39,545
- How bout you?
- Hmmm, good. Really good.

597
00:39:49,262 --> 00:39:51,132
Mom!? I’m home!

598
00:40:00,851 --> 00:40:03,404
Roe. Yes professor?

599
00:40:09,758 --> 00:40:11,357
Hey, how was the slumber party?

600
00:40:12,549 --> 00:40:16,084
As a matter of fact, it was great. Not thank to you.

601
00:40:16,738 --> 00:40:17,547
What?!

602
00:40:18,452 --> 00:40:20,583
You caused a lot of problems Felix.

603
00:40:21,439 --> 00:40:22,615
Ah, they’ll get over it.

604
00:40:23,605 --> 00:40:26,522
You know, Felix, you do this everywhere we go.

605
00:40:26,829 --> 00:40:29,829
And girls fall for it because they think that you’re cute…

606
00:40:29,933 --> 00:40:34,807
or funny or that they’ll actually… get something out of it… other than a bad reputation.

607
00:40:36,997 --> 00:40:38,483
I like these people.

608
00:40:39,215 --> 00:40:40,449
I like Brooke.

609
00:40:41,069 --> 00:40:43,781
And I really don’t like you for not caring about her.

610
00:40:45,291 --> 00:40:46,864
I do care about her.

611
00:40:53,105 --> 00:40:55,260
I really… like her, Anna.

612
00:40:57,954 --> 00:40:59,029
For real, okay?

613
00:41:02,997 --> 00:41:04,696
But it’s against the rules.

614
00:41:06,106 --> 00:41:07,503
I don’t know what to do.

615
00:41:48,122 --> 00:41:49,748
I got the test results back.

616
00:41:53,856 --> 00:41:54,853
I’m fine.

617
00:42:02,497 --> 00:42:03,855
One in two right?

618
00:42:16,892 --> 00:42:21,237
