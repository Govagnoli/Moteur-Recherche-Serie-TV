Douglas Adams once wrote:

00:00:06,316 --> 00:00:08,764
He felt that his whole life was some kind of dream…

3
00:00:09,756 --> 00:00:11,589
and he sometimes wondered whose it was…

4
00:00:13,486 --> 00:00:14,764
and whether they were enjoying it.

5
00:00:48,415 --> 00:00:49,744
Breakfast of champions, Dad?

6
00:00:50,814 --> 00:00:51,952
You were out late.

7
00:00:52,115 --> 00:00:52,811
You have fun?

8
00:00:53,005 --> 00:00:56,615
Ah… you know, I was… out with the guys.

9
00:00:57,711 --> 00:00:59,611
I thought maybe we could work out after school;

10
00:00:59,881 --> 00:01:00,788
do some weights.

11
00:01:00,961 --> 00:01:01,914
Yeah, whatever.

12
00:01:02,359 --> 00:01:05,379
We should be offering organic entrees in all our locations.

13
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:09,595
We'll talk about this when I get in. Yeah, I'll see ya in ten.

14
00:01:10,388 --> 00:01:11,249
Good morning, honey.

15
00:01:11,479 --> 00:01:12,343
Morning, wife.

16
00:01:12,862 --> 00:01:13,906
You're outta here early.

17
00:01:14,044 --> 00:01:15,104
Meetings all day.

18
00:01:16,615 --> 00:01:17,684
Good morning, Lucas.

19
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:23,061
Will you be home for dinner?

20
00:01:23,597 --> 00:01:24,320
I'll call ya.

21
00:01:25,237 --> 00:01:26,101
I better go.

22
00:01:26,556 --> 00:01:28,129
Got my eye set on a new location.

23
00:01:28,586 --> 00:01:30,151
How many café's can one person own?

24
00:01:31,478 --> 00:01:32,778
Even dozen should do it.

25
00:01:40,361 --> 00:01:41,958
Late night for you too, huh dad?

26
00:01:50,314 --> 00:01:52,649
Oh, man, I'm telling you, I'm telling you, I'm telling you.

27
00:01:53,688 --> 00:01:57,846
Finally taking the court – ladies and gentlemen – is the Rivercourt's own Nathan Lee,

28
00:01:57,919 --> 00:02:01,671
star player and recent applicant to the prestigious High Flyers basketball camp.

29
00:02:01,793 --> 00:02:03,764
Oh, you forgot, uh… ladies usual.

30
00:02:04,218 --> 00:02:06,078
Had to stop by the post office.

31
00:02:06,386 --> 00:02:08,526
High Flyers, baby. What's the word?

32
00:02:08,633 --> 00:02:10,384
I dunno; I haven't opened it yet.

33
00:02:10,502 --> 00:02:11,619
Dude, what is wrong with you?

34
00:02:12,586 --> 00:02:13,456
That's a felony.

35
00:02:13,641 --> 00:02:16,688
Yeah, whatever, turn us in. Come on, what-what's it say?

36
00:02:19,969 --> 00:02:21,245
Say's he's a finalist.

37
00:02:21,474 --> 00:02:22,703
Nathan, that's awesome.

38
00:02:22,811 --> 00:02:24,254
Alright, I'm just a finalist.

39
00:02:24,475 --> 00:02:26,549
It's not the same thing as me actually getting into the camp.

40
00:02:26,641 --> 00:02:28,070
Uh-huh, act like you don't want it.

41
00:02:28,381 --> 00:02:30,092
What I don't want is to get my hopes up.

42
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:33,410
There's no way they're gonna pick some guy that's never played organised basketball.

43
00:02:33,522 --> 00:02:36,630
They'll pick a guy who played like you did on my videotape.

44
00:02:37,172 --> 00:02:39,189
Nate, uh, I'm your best friend, right?

45
00:02:39,415 --> 00:02:41,252
So I feel like I can tell you this; uh…

46
00:02:41,699 --> 00:02:45,365
stop being so damn modest and come out here so we can keep you humble.

47
00:02:46,241 --> 00:02:47,219
Shoot for teams, huh?

48
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:48,713
Exactly.

49
00:02:52,364 --> 00:02:53,701
Oh, okay, okay.

50
00:03:02,415 --> 00:03:04,052
So, you wanna hang with the guys tonight?

51
00:03:04,570 --> 00:03:06,464
Oh, gee, there's a unique idea.

52
00:03:07,535 --> 00:03:09,757
Come on, Peyt, what, I can't bond with the team?

53
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:12,004
What about bonding with your girlfriend?

54
00:03:15,937 --> 00:03:17,053
I was listening to that.

55
00:03:17,151 --> 00:03:17,894
Fine!

56
00:03:18,503 --> 00:03:20,012
You don't wanna hang out with us?!

57
00:03:20,373 --> 00:03:22,665
Why don't you just sit in your room; listen to your loser rock…

58
00:03:22,779 --> 00:03:25,179
and do live sex shows on your webcam for all I care!

59
00:03:25,708 --> 00:03:26,915
Lucas, look out!

60
00:03:36,407 --> 00:03:37,558
Daddy teach you how to drive?

61
00:03:39,075 --> 00:03:41,389
Yeah, he sends his love.

62
00:03:42,065 --> 00:03:43,969
Now get outta my way, loser.

63
00:03:56,759 --> 00:03:58,102
'I'm sorry'.

64
00:04:02,424 --> 00:04:04,188
Why do you have to treat him like that?

65
00:04:04,394 --> 00:04:05,884
Could've easily been you, you know?

66
00:04:06,359 --> 00:04:08,316
If your dad had married his mom instead of yours.

67
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:10,537
Yeah, like that was ever gonna happen.

68
00:05:03,165 --> 00:05:07,482
You see, it's this… retro style and the, uh, leather interior package;

69
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:10,452
makes this one-one powerful sexy machine.

70
00:05:10,652 --> 00:05:13,872
And when you factor in the Keith Scott service guarantee and that elusive thing

71
00:05:13,923 --> 00:05:16,684
that we call the, uh, the cool factor;

72
00:05:16,981 --> 00:05:19,428
this car is definitely gonna get you laid.

73
00:05:22,372 --> 00:05:26,872
Uh, do me a favour; have a seat in my office and think about that leather interior, huh?

74
00:05:29,269 --> 00:05:30,855
Oh, let me guess:

75
00:05:30,969 --> 00:05:32,550
Doug ate your work ethic.

76
00:05:32,679 --> 00:05:35,248
Nah, I had to go by the uniform place; sign off the new Ravens logo.

77
00:05:35,326 --> 00:05:38,024
Yeah. Like Whitey's actually gonna let you make a decision.

78
00:05:38,403 --> 00:05:39,852
Come one, Keith, it's early, don't start.

79
00:05:39,965 --> 00:05:41,025
I'm the boss here.

80
00:05:41,388 --> 00:05:42,914
Maybe you shoulda married Deb;

81
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,735
you mighta gotten her parent's money, things'd be different.

82
00:05:45,893 --> 00:05:47,650
Can we just leave the past in the past?

83
00:05:47,803 --> 00:05:49,621
Yeah, that's what you're best at, isn't it?

84
00:05:50,906 --> 00:05:53,077
See that lady out there eyeing the convertible?

85
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:55,252
She's ready to deal.

86
00:05:56,149 --> 00:05:57,716
Try not to screw it up, huh?

87
00:05:58,181 --> 00:05:59,227
I'm on it, Keith.

88
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:02,406
Oh, hey, I gotta cut out early for basketball practice, okay?

89
00:06:02,503 --> 00:06:05,621
Just about the time the bars open up, right boozy?

90
00:06:07,019 --> 00:06:07,772
Huh?

91
00:06:13,537 --> 00:06:15,636
How bout I buy you a cold beer, Miss. Lee.

92
00:06:16,005 --> 00:06:16,741
Huh?

93
00:06:17,106 --> 00:06:20,444
Otis, you've been offering for ten years; you know I don't drink.

94
00:06:20,530 --> 00:06:21,764
Doesn't hurt to try, does it?

95
00:06:24,602 --> 00:06:25,646
Hey, sweetie.

96
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:28,168
What's up, mom. I got the mail; some bills,

97
00:06:28,254 --> 00:06:30,197
a letter from uncle Cooper and, uh…

98
00:06:30,409 --> 00:06:31,103
this.

99
00:06:32,742 --> 00:06:34,027
Thinking about taking some classes?

100
00:06:34,729 --> 00:06:37,453
If they offer a course in making ends meet.

101
00:06:39,214 --> 00:06:40,130
You ever regret it?

102
00:06:40,719 --> 00:06:41,921
Your folks cutting you off.

103
00:06:43,863 --> 00:06:45,582
Not for one second, Nate.

104
00:06:46,633 --> 00:06:48,276
Otherwise, I wouldn't have you.

105
00:06:50,498 --> 00:06:53,279
Besides, money buys you nothing but misery.

106
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:56,192
I mean… look at Dan and Karen and Lucas.

107
00:06:57,733 --> 00:07:01,661
Well, you know, you could up the traffic in here by hiring some… hot girls to dance in the bar.

108
00:07:01,736 --> 00:07:03,038
There you go. Yeah.

109
00:07:03,104 --> 00:07:03,872
Just saying.

110
00:07:04,466 --> 00:07:06,799
Speaking of hot girls... sorry I'm late.

111
00:07:07,441 --> 00:07:09,678
School bus driver ran out of gas.

112
00:07:09,872 --> 00:07:10,815
Where were you today?

113
00:07:10,897 --> 00:07:13,139
I told you, Mr. Hirshfield took us to the planetarium.

114
00:07:13,196 --> 00:07:14,967
If you ever listen to me, maybe you'd know that.

115
00:07:15,116 --> 00:07:18,971
Okay, alright. I just can't believe you went out in public with that hat.

116
00:07:19,596 --> 00:07:21,551
Remind me why I'm friends with you again.

117
00:07:22,729 --> 00:07:25,048
Nathan, this is from that basketball camp.

118
00:07:25,198 --> 00:07:26,508
Yeah, I'm a finalist.

119
00:07:27,634 --> 00:07:28,520
It's no big deal.

120
00:07:28,597 --> 00:07:31,704
Well, it's a huge deal, honey, I'm really really proud of you.

121
00:07:31,781 --> 00:07:32,959
Yeah, me too!

122
00:07:33,215 --> 00:07:35,985
Congratulations. Well, we'll have to celebrate later.

123
00:07:36,132 --> 00:07:39,103
Right now, dirty dishes are beckoning.

124
00:07:40,014 --> 00:07:41,633
You rock, don't let it go to your head.

125
00:07:43,987 --> 00:07:46,281
You know, you two are gonna end up married some day.

126
00:07:46,369 --> 00:07:48,939
Stop it. We've known each other forever; we're just friends.

127
00:07:49,024 --> 00:07:50,322
Good place to start.

128
00:07:51,893 --> 00:07:52,747
Keep dreaming.

129
00:07:54,925 --> 00:07:57,909
Nah, for real, man, I'm serous, dule here really got bigger.

130
00:07:57,981 --> 00:07:58,565
Skills.

131
00:07:59,265 --> 00:08:00,224
Nah, I'm serious.

132
00:08:07,314 --> 00:08:08,482
You guys must be lost.

133
00:08:12,885 --> 00:08:14,498
Well, Whitey closed up the gym.

134
00:08:16,034 --> 00:08:18,195
We gotta have somewhere to run.

135
00:08:18,471 --> 00:08:19,843
Well, you ain't bout to do it up here.

136
00:08:20,366 --> 00:08:23,320
- Oh contraire... 
- Tim, just say 'yes we are'.

137
00:08:24,026 --> 00:08:25,696
See, I'm in training for High Flyers.

138
00:08:26,462 --> 00:08:28,885
You wouldn't know anything about that now, would you?

139
00:08:29,095 --> 00:08:30,216
Street trash.

140
00:08:30,467 --> 00:08:31,378
You wanna bet?

141
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:33,181
Nate's a finalist, too.

142
00:08:33,284 --> 00:08:33,846
Guys.

143
00:08:33,923 --> 00:08:34,747
It's true.

144
00:08:40,971 --> 00:08:42,438
Pipe dream, much?

145
00:08:43,471 --> 00:08:45,852
Coz they only take one player from each high school.

146
00:08:46,908 --> 00:08:48,679
Now who d'ya think they're gonna pick, huh?

147
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:50,589
Star shooting guard…

148
00:08:51,187 --> 00:08:52,545
of the undefeated Ravens…

149
00:08:53,768 --> 00:08:55,232
or the Rivercourt bastard.

150
00:09:49,192 --> 00:09:51,267
So I guess the rumours are true;

151
00:09:52,372 --> 00:09:54,020
Mr. Size 14.

152
00:09:54,108 --> 00:09:57,292
Wh-a. Uh… I think… you're in the wrong locker room.

153
00:09:57,338 --> 00:10:01,809
Well… the… sign says 'Boys'… doesn't it?

154
00:10:01,997 --> 00:10:03,591
Okay. Whoa.

155
00:10:03,708 --> 00:10:04,456
Oops.

156
00:10:06,286 --> 00:10:08,946
I'm Brooke; but I bet you already knew that.

157
00:10:09,007 --> 00:10:10,933
Yeah, I-I gotta go.

158
00:10:16,816 --> 00:10:17,876
Hi, Coach Scott.

159
00:10:29,748 --> 00:10:32,590
Ah-ah, I got you. Come on. Push!

160
00:10:34,044 --> 00:10:35,402
God, I had it, dad.

161
00:10:35,665 --> 00:10:37,118
Right. What're you slinging?

162
00:10:37,521 --> 00:10:38,643
Bout 160.

163
00:10:38,893 --> 00:10:41,617
Wow, didn't know I had a daughter. Let's kick it up.

164
00:10:41,991 --> 00:10:44,807
We're gonna have to start 200 a day if we're gonna impress the High Flyers scout.

165
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:46,747
Why, coz you couldn't, back in the day?

166
00:10:46,901 --> 00:10:49,998
I'm trying to help you. I don't want you to make the same mistakes that I did.

167
00:10:50,337 --> 00:10:52,722
What do you know about your other son applying for High Flyers?

168
00:10:53,035 --> 00:10:55,329
Don't call him that. Don't worry, he'll never make it.

169
00:10:58,643 --> 00:11:00,044
Well, he made finalist.

170
00:11:01,150 --> 00:11:03,869
Which means Whitey must have signed off on his application.

171
00:11:09,644 --> 00:11:12,492
You're not seriously considering Deb's son for High Flyers spot.

172
00:11:12,737 --> 00:11:14,498
Well he's your son too, Danny.

173
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:16,249
And good morning to you.

174
00:11:16,347 --> 00:11:18,835
That kid's just trying to sabotage Lucas' shot.

175
00:11:18,994 --> 00:11:23,207
That 'kid' sent in a tape that impressed the scouts so much that they made him a finalist.

176
00:11:23,276 --> 00:11:25,015
All I did was sign the papers.

177
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:27,902
I'm an equal opportunity instigator.

178
00:11:28,051 --> 00:11:29,280
You did this just to get me.

179
00:11:29,376 --> 00:11:30,123
Danny.

180
00:11:30,482 --> 00:11:33,786
Maybe it didn't make the nightly news but this is not about you.

181
00:11:33,873 --> 00:11:36,781
Nathan's never played for a real team. He's a street-ball player, Whitey.

182
00:11:36,847 --> 00:11:39,165
And apparently, a pretty damn good one!

183
00:11:39,288 --> 00:11:41,286
Least he got something from you.

184
00:11:42,576 --> 00:11:43,683
What're you up to?

185
00:11:43,806 --> 00:11:45,079
Just fairness.

186
00:11:45,239 --> 00:11:47,359
I wouldn't expect you to understand that.

187
00:11:48,131 --> 00:11:50,129
But if Lucas is the better player,

188
00:11:50,442 --> 00:11:52,116
he's got nothing to worry about.

189
00:11:53,063 --> 00:11:55,402
Till then, let the best man win.

190
00:11:57,921 --> 00:12:02,160
Oh, and, uh, be sure and let the door hit you in the ass on the way out.

191
00:12:09,069 --> 00:12:10,450
She was totally naked?

192
00:12:10,528 --> 00:12:11,695
As the day she was born.

193
00:12:11,876 --> 00:12:13,630
Only a lot more… curvy.

194
00:12:13,757 --> 00:12:14,714
Well what happened then?

195
00:12:14,924 --> 00:12:16,547
I got the hell outta there.

196
00:12:17,035 --> 00:12:18,460
You and Brooke Davis.

197
00:12:18,719 --> 00:12:20,398
Captain of the 'CheerSluts'.

198
00:12:20,685 --> 00:12:21,816
That is hard to picture.

199
00:12:22,922 --> 00:12:24,923
Yeah, I'd say 'hard' is the right word.

200
00:12:25,016 --> 00:12:25,615
Eeew.

201
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,379
Okay, what's this?

202
00:12:31,755 --> 00:12:33,112
Oh, score, a bracelet.

203
00:12:33,576 --> 00:12:35,856
Last time I got some fake tattoo with a random number.

204
00:12:36,276 --> 00:12:39,849
Well, here. It matches that, uh, thing you call a shirt.

205
00:12:40,351 --> 00:12:42,604
My mother made this for me, and shut up.

206
00:12:42,757 --> 00:12:44,073
- You shut up.
- You shut up.

207
00:12:46,573 --> 00:12:48,047
Don't say I never gave you anything.

208
00:13:06,643 --> 00:13:08,767
I think you have the wrong son's house.

209
00:13:09,183 --> 00:13:11,600
I need to talk to you about your game.

210
00:13:16,919 --> 00:13:20,021
I didn't know you were that good a player till I saw that tape.

211
00:13:21,301 --> 00:13:24,332
You're a little rough round the edges but you got the makings.

212
00:13:25,853 --> 00:13:29,344
If this is about me joining the team, you can forget it.

213
00:13:31,188 --> 00:13:34,317
Son, I'm a lot smarter than you give me credit for.

214
00:13:35,289 --> 00:13:38,653
Asking you to play alongside Lucas, when that, uh,

215
00:13:39,145 --> 00:13:43,114
ass-crack of a father of yours is my assistant coach;

216
00:13:43,541 --> 00:13:45,683
I wouldn't wish that on my worst enemy.

217
00:13:48,247 --> 00:13:52,261
Tell me, why did you apply to the High Flyers?

218
00:13:53,357 --> 00:13:54,566
Coz I love the game.

219
00:13:56,174 --> 00:14:00,434
Coz all the messed up… history in this town has kept me from being able to play.

220
00:14:02,609 --> 00:14:05,035
This camp might give me a shot at playing college;

221
00:14:05,104 --> 00:14:08,151
where I don't have to… live in anybody else's shadow.

222
00:14:11,672 --> 00:14:14,707
I know I'm good, I just wanna prove that I'm good enough.

223
00:14:15,035 --> 00:14:17,702
Nathan, I'm gonna level with you:

224
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:21,456
you getting into that camp is a long shot.

225
00:14:22,261 --> 00:14:25,205
I can only pick one athlete from this school…

226
00:14:26,581 --> 00:14:29,408
normally, Lucas'd be a shoe-in…

227
00:14:31,098 --> 00:14:33,268
but I was impressed by your tape.

228
00:14:33,703 --> 00:14:35,203
Then… pick me.

229
00:14:36,151 --> 00:14:37,615
It's not that easy.

230
00:14:39,023 --> 00:14:42,514
I have to be sure you can hold your own with a real team:

231
00:14:43,129 --> 00:14:46,197
passing, defence… running picks.

232
00:14:46,862 --> 00:14:48,726
Well, I can't play in that gym, Coach.

233
00:14:49,443 --> 00:14:51,527
Well, then play at the Rivercourt.

234
00:14:52,735 --> 00:14:54,363
You want me to play against Lucas?

235
00:14:55,904 --> 00:14:57,864
Technically, I want you to beat him.

236
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:00,446
That's up to you.

237
00:15:18,324 --> 00:15:20,407
Want me to cue Springsteen's glory days?

238
00:15:20,762 --> 00:15:21,704
Take the picture?

239
00:15:22,247 --> 00:15:23,435
So, I'm nostalgic.

240
00:15:24,756 --> 00:15:26,081
That's one word for it.

241
00:15:27,014 --> 00:15:28,048
Sweet dreams, dad.

242
00:15:28,816 --> 00:15:30,296
Hey, cut me some slack, son.

243
00:15:31,781 --> 00:15:35,215
I look at you and I see… I see myself twenty years ago.

244
00:15:35,699 --> 00:15:37,351
It reminds me of all that promise.

245
00:15:38,636 --> 00:15:39,733
If I ride you,

246
00:15:41,124 --> 00:15:44,187
it's because I wanna see you feel all the triumph that I never had.

247
00:15:46,096 --> 00:15:49,650
But I'm telling you, this 'kid' is a risk to all that.

248
00:15:50,709 --> 00:15:51,970
Oh, you mean you other son?

249
00:15:52,241 --> 00:15:55,763
Only biologically. He means nothing to me, and you mean everything.

250
00:15:58,093 --> 00:15:59,244
I saw his tape today,

251
00:15:59,691 --> 00:16:01,948
and I was wrong when I said that he's no threat to you.

252
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:04,815
So you're gonna have to do whatever it takes to beat him.

253
00:16:06,003 --> 00:16:07,104
Don't sweat it, dad.

254
00:16:08,921 --> 00:16:11,297
I'll protect what's left of your good name.

255
00:16:15,524 --> 00:16:16,996
You got bigger problems anyway.

256
00:16:21,097 --> 00:16:24,164
Come visit us in ten years and… I bet you can meet the kids

257
00:16:24,231 --> 00:16:28,142
and get a tour of our big house… and see how happy we are.

258
00:16:39,221 --> 00:16:40,349
What time is it?

259
00:16:42,002 --> 00:16:43,353
God, I gotta go.

260
00:16:43,436 --> 00:16:44,153
Oh, no.

261
00:16:44,234 --> 00:16:48,228
Oh, I've already worked late a lot these past few weeks.

262
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,145
Dan is not gonna be suspicious, trust me.

263
00:16:59,273 --> 00:17:00,603
Why don't you stay the night?

264
00:17:02,641 --> 00:17:04,146
You know I can't do that.

265
00:17:04,525 --> 00:17:06,021
Well, you could if you leave him.

266
00:17:21,113 --> 00:17:22,425
Who would protect Lucas?

267
00:17:22,568 --> 00:17:24,816
From what? Becoming a jack-hole like his father?

268
00:17:25,123 --> 00:17:26,490
I think it's a little late for that.

269
00:17:26,567 --> 00:17:27,151
Keith.

270
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:28,692
Okay, I'm sorry.

271
00:17:32,604 --> 00:17:34,667
You know, I would raise Lucas like he was my own.

272
00:17:42,223 --> 00:17:43,954
Sometimes I think he is.

273
00:17:52,275 --> 00:17:53,620
Lucas, you're up late.

274
00:17:54,395 --> 00:17:55,398
Makes two of us.

275
00:17:55,628 --> 00:17:56,668
Meetings, you know.

276
00:17:56,817 --> 00:17:57,645
Yeah, I know.

277
00:17:58,705 --> 00:17:59,469
Hey, wait.

278
00:18:03,411 --> 00:18:06,620
I thought I'd make some coco. We could sit and talk like we used to.

279
00:18:07,127 --> 00:18:08,614
You want a late night chat, mom?

280
00:18:09,574 --> 00:18:11,428
Why don't you just try calling Uncle Keith?

281
00:18:11,674 --> 00:18:13,124
I'm sure he'll come running.

282
00:18:19,738 --> 00:18:23,430
As you see, class, galaxies come in three main-

283
00:18:23,517 --> 00:18:25,443
Of course you're gonna do it, you've gotta play this game.

284
00:18:25,508 --> 00:18:28,340
Haley, it's Lucas.

285
00:18:28,422 --> 00:18:31,315
So, you can't let him stop you from chasing after your dream.

286
00:18:32,037 --> 00:18:33,394
That's easy for you to say.

287
00:18:33,624 --> 00:18:37,024
Dude, nothing is ever gonna happen for you if you don't put yourself out there.

288
00:18:38,427 --> 00:18:39,738
You gotta shoot for the stars.

289
00:18:47,125 --> 00:18:49,604
What about you? What're your dreams?

290
00:18:50,019 --> 00:18:50,832
Chocolate.

291
00:18:51,415 --> 00:18:52,978
- Seriously?
- Yeah, chocolate.

292
00:18:54,391 --> 00:18:55,169
Um…

293
00:18:56,885 --> 00:18:58,425
well, I never told anybody this…

294
00:18:58,993 --> 00:19:01,042
but, I kinda wanna be a singer.

295
00:19:01,456 --> 00:19:02,164
A singer?

296
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:04,763
Yeah, you know, like, tour the country and play concerts

297
00:19:04,824 --> 00:19:07,503
and wear really cool clothes and then release an album.

298
00:19:08,856 --> 00:19:09,880
Oh, you think that's funny?

299
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:11,245
No… I just…

300
00:19:12,793 --> 00:19:14,221
Haley, I've heard you sing.

301
00:19:14,314 --> 00:19:15,685
Shut up.

302
00:19:16,105 --> 00:19:18,829
Just because I'm tone-deaf doesn't mean I can't dream, okay?

303
00:19:19,719 --> 00:19:22,188
No, yeah, you're right. You're right, I guess it doesn't.

304
00:19:32,393 --> 00:19:33,210
I got it.

305
00:19:34,214 --> 00:19:35,612
Seduce the tutor girl.

306
00:19:36,119 --> 00:19:39,660
You know, like, get inside her head and… steal her away from him.

307
00:19:40,035 --> 00:19:42,473
Then dump her; crush her heart.

308
00:19:42,984 --> 00:19:45,125
Tim, that's the dumbest idea ever.

309
00:19:45,381 --> 00:19:47,302
What're you talking about? It's genius.

310
00:19:47,896 --> 00:19:49,077
You wanna hear genius?

311
00:19:49,787 --> 00:19:51,301
Tonight's the game.

312
00:19:51,663 --> 00:19:53,537
He can't win if he doesn't show up.

313
00:19:53,922 --> 00:19:55,069
You're gonna kill him?.

314
00:20:00,007 --> 00:20:02,245
You got mad things, yo.

315
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:04,944
Tim, just say it's a good plan.

316
00:20:27,437 --> 00:20:29,572
Um… you're a tutor, right?

317
00:20:30,044 --> 00:20:31,672
You're a jackasses girlfriend, right?

318
00:20:33,362 --> 00:20:34,621
Guess we're both right.

319
00:20:34,815 --> 00:20:39,613
Uh… look, I'm Peyton… and… I know you're friends with Lucas' brother.

320
00:20:39,695 --> 00:20:41,150
Half-brother, his name's Nathan.

321
00:20:41,236 --> 00:20:42,583
He's, like, you're boyfriend or-

322
00:20:42,638 --> 00:20:44,057
He's, like, my friend.

323
00:20:44,426 --> 00:20:46,447
Why do you people always assume that? God.

324
00:20:46,654 --> 00:20:49,982
Look, let me just save you some time, okay, Goldilocks, he's really not into cheerleaders.

325
00:20:50,144 --> 00:20:53,146
Okay, first: retract the claws.

326
00:20:53,498 --> 00:20:57,220
Second: Lucas is planning on doing something to Nathan tonight.

327
00:20:57,594 --> 00:20:58,500
Before the game.

328
00:20:59,678 --> 00:21:00,702
What's he gonna do?

329
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:02,305
I don't have any specifics…

330
00:21:02,663 --> 00:21:05,842
but, he will do anything to get to that stupid basketball camp.

331
00:21:06,391 --> 00:21:07,727
So you might wanna warn Nathan.

332
00:21:09,546 --> 00:21:10,963
Just thought you'd like to know.

333
00:21:25,041 --> 00:21:26,938
I thought it was time to break the ice.

334
00:21:28,105 --> 00:21:29,353
After seventeen years?

335
00:21:30,312 --> 00:21:31,182
Nice try.

336
00:21:33,604 --> 00:21:35,099
That's my DNA, you know?

337
00:21:35,795 --> 00:21:37,244
If that's what you need to believe.

338
00:21:38,678 --> 00:21:39,784
Let's get right to it.

339
00:21:40,849 --> 00:21:43,260
I'll give you five-hundred bucks to withdraw your application.

340
00:21:43,588 --> 00:21:45,170
Well, I'd give you this weeks allowance…

341
00:21:51,587 --> 00:21:53,423
You really think you've got a chance to win this thing?

342
00:21:54,355 --> 00:21:55,483
You're kidding yourself.

343
00:21:55,830 --> 00:21:58,345
Just like your mother was kidding herself when she moved to Tree Hill.

344
00:22:00,622 --> 00:22:01,610
You know what?

345
00:22:02,358 --> 00:22:04,713
I wasn't even sure if I was gonna go through with this game…

346
00:22:05,789 --> 00:22:07,003
but now I am gonna play.

347
00:22:08,257 --> 00:22:09,588
And I'm gonna win.

348
00:22:12,389 --> 00:22:13,756
I guess you are my son after all.

349
00:22:29,295 --> 00:22:33,928
Okay, it's eight bucks for the beers, ooo, twenty dollar tip.

350
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,874
Hey, the twenty's on the Rivercourt team.

351
00:22:36,406 --> 00:22:37,722
Ah, good man.

352
00:22:41,824 --> 00:22:42,632
Hey, honey.

353
00:22:43,385 --> 00:22:44,183
What's going on?

354
00:22:44,506 --> 00:22:46,918
We're starting the victory party a little early.

355
00:22:50,251 --> 00:22:51,300
What, bad idea?

356
00:22:51,423 --> 00:22:53,052
No, it's just…

357
00:22:54,659 --> 00:22:55,765
Dan came to visit me.

358
00:22:56,235 --> 00:22:57,675
He offered me cash to drop out.

359
00:22:58,838 --> 00:22:59,560
Oh, honey.

360
00:23:01,028 --> 00:23:03,712
Shut him out. You're good.

361
00:23:04,458 --> 00:23:08,090
I don't know if I tell you this enough, but I… am so proud of you.

362
00:23:08,986 --> 00:23:11,744
Even more so when you kick that kid's butt tonight.

363
00:23:11,909 --> 00:23:14,157
Yeah. That's the plan.

364
00:23:21,279 --> 00:23:22,226
Good luck, Nathan.

365
00:23:23,026 --> 00:23:25,712
Thank god. Where have you been and why aren't you answering your phone?

366
00:23:26,087 --> 00:23:28,815
Right here and I'm… recharging the batteries. Why, what's going on?

367
00:23:28,897 --> 00:23:31,933
Because Lucas is gonna try something tonight, okay?

368
00:23:32,339 --> 00:23:34,396
Let him. I'm not scared of him.

369
00:23:35,211 --> 00:23:36,859
Will you just be careful, please?

370
00:23:37,023 --> 00:23:39,395
I'm gonna be fine, alright? I promise.

371
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:51,319
Yo, Nate!

372
00:23:53,009 --> 00:23:55,066
What the-! Get off of me!

373
00:24:20,116 --> 00:24:21,423
Oh, come on.

374
00:24:25,085 --> 00:24:25,802
Oops.

375
00:24:32,659 --> 00:24:33,702
I warned you.

376
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:36,727
It seems you and me have something in common.

377
00:24:37,266 --> 00:24:38,218
We don't quit.

378
00:24:38,709 --> 00:24:40,060
You and I, moron.

379
00:24:41,838 --> 00:24:42,585
What?

380
00:24:45,002 --> 00:24:46,016
Look,

381
00:24:46,787 --> 00:24:49,308
I have been working towards this camp since junior high…

382
00:24:49,891 --> 00:24:52,159
and nobody's gonna screw it up for me.

383
00:24:52,405 --> 00:24:54,422
Especially not you.

384
00:24:55,379 --> 00:24:56,997
So I'm gonna be nice

385
00:24:57,381 --> 00:25:00,106
and let you walk away from this game.

386
00:25:01,257 --> 00:25:03,044
We should take his clothes.

387
00:25:05,027 --> 00:25:07,452
Tim, what is wrong with you?

388
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:10,023
You pitch that every time we kidnap a guy.

389
00:25:10,223 --> 00:25:13,045
I mean, it'll make it harder for him to get home.

390
00:25:14,534 --> 00:25:15,548
And so will this.

391
00:25:20,734 --> 00:25:22,127
Getting your jollies?

392
00:25:28,194 --> 00:25:29,698
You tell anybody about this…

393
00:25:30,293 --> 00:25:31,355
and you're dead.

394
00:25:33,278 --> 00:25:34,072
Let's go.

395
00:25:55,319 --> 00:25:56,058
You ready?

396
00:25:56,841 --> 00:25:58,899
Nope. I'm not going.

397
00:25:59,959 --> 00:26:03,671
Oh, come on, Peyt, I thought we were gonna work on… you know, getting back to normal.

398
00:26:05,662 --> 00:26:10,746
Okay, trust me when I say that normal is the last thing I want with us

399
00:26:10,814 --> 00:26:14,033
because – in case you haven't noticed – normal sucks with us, Lucas.

400
00:26:14,305 --> 00:26:16,190
And I hate it when you call me 'Peyt'.

401
00:26:16,824 --> 00:26:18,043
Is this about Nathan?

402
00:26:18,996 --> 00:26:22,016
No. It's about you.

403
00:26:23,056 --> 00:26:26,608
I'm starting to see who you really are and I may be late to that party but…

404
00:26:26,809 --> 00:26:28,135
better late than never.

405
00:26:33,248 --> 00:26:35,107
You did something to Nathan, didn't you?

406
00:26:36,157 --> 00:26:38,805
What, your stupid kidnapping thing?

407
00:26:38,908 --> 00:26:40,981
I thought you said this wasn't about him. Hm?

408
00:26:45,389 --> 00:26:48,384
You know, I'll just come back when you're not so… PMS.

409
00:26:48,912 --> 00:26:50,008
Don't bother.

410
00:26:50,391 --> 00:26:51,963
- Peyton- 
- Luke, I mean it.

411
00:26:52,716 --> 00:26:53,633
We're done.

412
00:27:01,215 --> 00:27:02,301
Your loss.

413
00:27:03,289 --> 00:27:04,047
Peyt.

414
00:27:17,179 --> 00:27:18,167
Hey, where's Nate, man?

415
00:27:19,234 --> 00:27:20,564
Maybe he chickened out.

416
00:27:21,352 --> 00:27:22,652
Maybe you're a dick.

417
00:27:23,784 --> 00:27:24,506
What?

418
00:27:25,178 --> 00:27:26,048
Where's Nathan?

419
00:27:26,288 --> 00:27:27,702
That's what we're trying to find out.

420
00:27:29,017 --> 00:27:31,131
Hey, how'd you get that shiner on your eye, dawg?

421
00:27:31,618 --> 00:27:33,958
What, you and your boyfriend here like it kinda rough?

422
00:27:39,072 --> 00:27:39,574
Hey!

423
00:27:41,147 --> 00:27:42,811
Break it up, break it up.

424
00:27:43,015 --> 00:27:47,055
Come on, what're you trying to do? Get thrown outta the game before it starts?

425
00:27:47,331 --> 00:27:48,411
Get over there.

426
00:27:53,106 --> 00:27:54,769
My son better be alright.

427
00:27:58,790 --> 00:28:00,628
Where are you, Nathan?

428
00:28:13,232 --> 00:28:14,002
Get in.

429
00:28:14,418 --> 00:28:15,461
How'd you find me?

430
00:28:16,101 --> 00:28:18,128
You think you're the first guy he's done this to?

431
00:28:19,869 --> 00:28:21,384
I can see why you stay with the guy.

432
00:28:21,758 --> 00:28:23,383
Actually, I broke up with him tonight.

433
00:28:23,996 --> 00:28:25,941
So you're helping me just to piss him off?

434
00:28:26,064 --> 00:28:29,527
That, and you seem like a decent guy.

435
00:28:29,878 --> 00:28:32,076
Plus, I think everybody deserves a shot.

436
00:28:32,183 --> 00:28:35,413
If you really want something bad enough no one has the right to stand in your way.

437
00:28:38,542 --> 00:28:39,335
What?

438
00:28:39,664 --> 00:28:40,732
Nothing, I just…

439
00:28:41,538 --> 00:28:43,651
I got that weird… déjà vu thing.

440
00:28:45,112 --> 00:28:46,811
I don't believe in past lives.

441
00:28:47,281 --> 00:28:50,323
I think we've got one life, one chance and what we do with it is up to us.

442
00:28:51,821 --> 00:28:55,531
So get it. I'm your only hope of making it to the stupid game on time.

443
00:29:12,841 --> 00:29:16,646
Well, ladies and gentlemen, the game's looking like a forfeit, with Nathan Lee a no-show-

444
00:29:16,691 --> 00:29:17,803
Not so fast, Mouth.

445
00:29:18,611 --> 00:29:19,491
What'd you do?

446
00:29:19,656 --> 00:29:22,161
What, it's not my fault your boyfriend finally grew a brain.

447
00:29:22,385 --> 00:29:23,127
Sweetie.

448
00:29:23,205 --> 00:29:25,427
Peyton said that you were gonna try something...

449
00:29:34,437 --> 00:29:35,862
- Are you alright?
- Yeah.

450
00:29:45,323 --> 00:29:46,131
Am I too late?

451
00:29:46,403 --> 00:29:47,136
Almost.

452
00:29:47,586 --> 00:29:49,052
Get this game started.

453
00:29:49,215 --> 00:29:50,848
Four on four. Let's hustle.

454
00:29:51,217 --> 00:29:51,953
No.

455
00:29:53,797 --> 00:29:55,133
Me against him.

456
00:29:55,849 --> 00:29:57,181
It's the way it's always been, right?

457
00:29:58,789 --> 00:30:00,300
Why should tonight be any different?

458
00:30:01,062 --> 00:30:02,096
Your funeral.

459
00:30:02,295 --> 00:30:04,345
Game to eleven by one.

460
00:30:05,184 --> 00:30:05,987
Let's go!

461
00:30:07,749 --> 00:30:08,608
Shoot for ball.

462
00:30:09,346 --> 00:30:10,897
Fine by me.

463
00:31:10,002 --> 00:31:15,139
So, rank my last two girlfriends and you'll have the score folks; it's ten-nine, Nathan Lee.

464
00:31:17,888 --> 00:31:19,997
Oh, and that's a foul by Scott.

465
00:31:20,726 --> 00:31:21,943
That's gotta hurt.

466
00:31:35,081 --> 00:31:35,890
No foul…

467
00:31:36,428 --> 00:31:37,478
the basket counts.

468
00:31:38,755 --> 00:31:43,099
And Lee calls it good. It's ten-ten, game point. Next basket wins.

469
00:31:49,955 --> 00:31:51,722
You know, he's never mentioned you once;

470
00:31:52,551 --> 00:31:53,754
not in all these years.

471
00:31:56,048 --> 00:31:59,719
And you really think things would have been different if he'd married my mom?

472
00:32:00,764 --> 00:32:02,395
If you do, you're a fool.

473
00:32:02,827 --> 00:32:03,923
You're the fool…

474
00:32:04,296 --> 00:32:06,852
and after you miss this basket, a loser too.

475
00:32:08,198 --> 00:32:08,981
Whatever.

476
00:32:09,585 --> 00:32:10,605
This is for my mom.

477
00:32:47,445 --> 00:32:51,236
Looks like Nathan's going to High Flyers after all.

478
00:32:56,470 --> 00:32:57,867
It's just a game, Dan.

479
00:33:15,853 --> 00:33:16,980
Good game.

480
00:33:18,035 --> 00:33:19,607
You deserve to go to that camp.

481
00:33:20,979 --> 00:33:21,764
Thanks.

482
00:33:22,315 --> 00:33:24,317
You're gonna be okay. Just…

483
00:33:25,972 --> 00:33:27,671
come back to us soon.

484
00:33:30,610 --> 00:33:31,620
What's that-?

485
00:33:32,838 --> 00:33:35,628
They haven't invented words for how much I love you.

486
00:33:38,090 --> 00:33:40,149
Doesn't look like I'll be needed this anymore.

487
00:33:46,601 --> 00:33:48,709
Don't say I never gave you anything.

488
00:34:04,326 --> 00:34:05,222
Haley?!

489
00:34:10,121 --> 00:34:10,854
Haley?!

490
00:34:13,602 --> 00:34:14,381
Haley?!

491
00:34:17,203 --> 00:34:18,042
Haley?!

492
00:34:20,418 --> 00:34:21,252
Haley?

493
00:34:22,763 --> 00:34:23,541
Haley?!

494
00:34:23,721 --> 00:34:24,601
Hey, Nate?

495
00:34:26,265 --> 00:34:26,940
Nate.

496
00:34:27,575 --> 00:34:28,635
Hey, it's me.

497
00:34:29,326 --> 00:34:30,137
Don't worry.

498
00:34:31,231 --> 00:34:32,496
It's okay, it's me.

499
00:34:36,884 --> 00:34:37,756
Hey…

500
00:34:39,353 --> 00:34:40,862
welcome back little brother.

501
00:34:58,332 --> 00:34:59,249
How're you feeling?

502
00:35:00,385 --> 00:35:01,833
Like I hit a brick wall.

503
00:35:04,328 --> 00:35:06,155
Well, the doc says you're gonna be fine.

504
00:35:11,991 --> 00:35:13,718
You know, what was this anyway, huh?

505
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:18,172
Some sort of messed up… anything Lucas can do, I can do better?

506
00:35:18,699 --> 00:35:22,738
No… you wanna hear something really messed up though?

507
00:35:24,815 --> 00:35:27,158
I thought I died, went to heaven.

508
00:35:28,351 --> 00:35:29,195
No kidding.

509
00:35:29,522 --> 00:35:30,230
Yeah.

510
00:35:30,922 --> 00:35:34,060
Only… heaven was a place where…

511
00:35:34,561 --> 00:35:36,441
Dan chose your mom…

512
00:35:36,696 --> 00:35:37,767
over mine.

513
00:35:39,625 --> 00:35:41,396
Then Haley was tone-deaf.

514
00:35:43,429 --> 00:35:45,451
But that was only a dream.

515
00:35:46,767 --> 00:35:49,052
I did kick your ass on one-on-one, though.

516
00:35:49,118 --> 00:35:50,914
Well, I guess it was a dream then, huh?

517
00:35:56,905 --> 00:36:00,136
I know you… you asked me not to, but…

518
00:36:01,124 --> 00:36:02,270
I called Haley.

519
00:36:04,637 --> 00:36:06,884
She's your wife, Nate.

520
00:36:06,981 --> 00:36:08,180
And she loves you.

521
00:36:08,958 --> 00:36:10,524
She needed to know.

522
00:36:15,317 --> 00:36:16,096
Nate?

523
00:36:17,945 --> 00:36:19,294
I have to ask you something.

524
00:36:23,535 --> 00:36:25,044
When you hit the wall…

525
00:36:27,723 --> 00:36:29,960
there was no brake marks on the track.

526
00:36:32,712 --> 00:36:35,142
You're asking me if I did this on purpose?

527
00:36:39,842 --> 00:36:40,615
Nathan.

528
00:36:41,056 --> 00:36:42,304
Oh, thank god.

529
00:36:44,742 --> 00:36:45,934
I'll let you two, uh…

530
00:36:49,401 --> 00:36:50,516
Nathan, I-

531
00:36:50,609 --> 00:36:51,879
I love you, mom.

532
00:36:55,202 --> 00:36:59,756
I mean that. And I know I've been a jerk lately; to you,

533
00:37:01,192 --> 00:37:02,441
to everybody else.

534
00:37:06,123 --> 00:37:07,055
I'm sorry.

535
00:37:07,930 --> 00:37:09,169
You've been hurting.

536
00:37:09,271 --> 00:37:10,367
It doesn't matter.

537
00:37:11,232 --> 00:37:13,536
I know you're just trying to be a good mother.

538
00:37:26,056 --> 00:37:29,092
I haven't been a good mother, Nathan.

539
00:37:30,407 --> 00:37:32,189
But that's going to change now.

540
00:37:33,577 --> 00:37:34,989
What're you talking about?

541
00:37:37,294 --> 00:37:39,439
I need to be stronger for you…

542
00:37:40,042 --> 00:37:41,462
and for myself.

543
00:37:43,386 --> 00:37:45,628
So, while you're healing from this…

544
00:37:46,285 --> 00:37:47,672
I'll be healing too.

545
00:37:49,673 --> 00:37:50,970
I promise you.

546
00:37:53,965 --> 00:37:55,182
Whatever it is…

547
00:37:56,279 --> 00:37:57,527
I got your back.

548
00:38:01,016 --> 00:38:04,020
Do you ever… wonder what life would be like…

549
00:38:04,620 --> 00:38:06,309
if Dan had married Karen…

550
00:38:07,375 --> 00:38:09,222
and just stayed out of our lives?

551
00:38:11,209 --> 00:38:12,822
All the time.

552
00:38:13,604 --> 00:38:14,420
Why?

553
00:38:25,374 --> 00:38:27,091
Glad to see you're awake, son.

554
00:38:57,503 --> 00:38:59,414
A receipt for a car?

555
00:39:18,312 --> 00:39:20,161
Were you able to get in touch with Keith?

556
00:39:21,343 --> 00:39:22,811
His voicemail is full.

557
00:39:24,165 --> 00:39:27,047
He… needs to know what's happened to Nathan.

558
00:39:29,131 --> 00:39:31,757
But I… can't even leave him a message.

559
00:39:32,683 --> 00:39:34,147
Where is he, Whitey?

560
00:39:35,274 --> 00:39:36,677
I wish I knew.

561
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:52,114
It's okay, Deb.

562
00:39:52,913 --> 00:39:54,321
I'll be here when you get out.

563
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:06,209
'BRIARWOOD RECOVERY CENTER: PRIVATE'

564
00:40:13,562 --> 00:40:16,460
Sorry guys, visiting hours are over.

565
00:40:19,649 --> 00:40:20,694
You need anything?

566
00:40:21,176 --> 00:40:22,369
No, I'm cool, man.

567
00:40:32,665 --> 00:40:34,016
I know you both want me.

568
00:40:35,491 --> 00:40:37,846
Yeah. In your dreams.

569
00:41:18,052 --> 00:41:18,828
Hello?

570
00:41:19,523 --> 00:41:20,835
It's me, Nathan.

571
00:41:21,904 --> 00:41:22,943
Thank god.

572
00:41:23,850 --> 00:41:24,879
What happened?

573
00:41:25,611 --> 00:41:26,794
I'm gonna be okay.

574
00:41:26,896 --> 00:41:28,160
Well, I'm glad.

575
00:41:28,923 --> 00:41:30,793
I'm coming home tomorrow, okay?

576
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:32,528
Actually, no,

577
00:41:33,814 --> 00:41:35,094
it's not okay.

578
00:41:37,275 --> 00:41:38,683
Don't come home, Haley.

579
00:41:39,093 --> 00:41:40,853
Nathan, I have to come home.

580
00:41:40,971 --> 00:41:42,349
No, you don't.

581
00:41:43,404 --> 00:41:47,301
You have to go after your dream; just like I have to go after mine.

582
00:41:49,184 --> 00:41:50,725
Coz if we don't, then…

583
00:41:52,108 --> 00:41:53,884
we're just gonna end up regretting it…

584
00:41:55,256 --> 00:41:57,171
then we're gonna end up resenting each other.

585
00:41:58,042 --> 00:42:00,299
- Nathan, I wouldn't-
- Yeah, but we don't know that.

586
00:42:01,431 --> 00:42:03,289
Nobody knows what's gonna happen.

587
00:42:05,701 --> 00:42:07,747
Whatever choice you make today…

588
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:11,615
is gonna affect the rest of your life.

589
00:42:13,181 --> 00:42:14,072
So…

590
00:42:15,685 --> 00:42:17,078
don't come home, Haley.

591
00:42:18,625 --> 00:42:20,503
Nathan, listen…

592
00:42:21,368 --> 00:42:22,649
Coz I don't want you to.
