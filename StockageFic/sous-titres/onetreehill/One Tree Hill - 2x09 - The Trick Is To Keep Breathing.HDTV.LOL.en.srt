1
00:00:00,343 --> 00:00:01,715
Previously on One Tree Hill.

2
00:00:01,772 --> 00:00:04,235
I knew this meant a lot to you. I bought it back.

3
00:00:06,483 --> 00:00:07,332
You like her, huh?

4
00:00:07,393 --> 00:00:10,108
Yeah, but guys like me don’t get girls like her.

5
00:00:10,169 --> 00:00:12,436
Felix, you took care of me?

6
00:00:12,867 --> 00:00:13,619
Yeah…

7
00:00:15,539 --> 00:00:17,194
Sometimes you gotta break the rules.

8
00:00:19,015 --> 00:00:22,950
Relax, it’s cool. Peyton and I did a couple of lines the other night. Aint that right Peyton?

9
00:00:23,015 --> 00:00:26,825
You’ve got a good sound… and watching you tonight, I could definitely see us doing something together.

10
00:00:26,866 --> 00:00:28,156
- So you won’t be alone tonight. 
- Nope.

11
00:00:28,216 --> 00:00:31,381
- What’re you gonna do until then? 
- Probably just gonna… hang out with Brooke.

12
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:37,044
Where do you go when you’re lonely, 
I’ll follow you.

13
00:00:37,101 --> 00:00:40,388
This is… the first time I’ve been in a church since my mom died.

14
00:00:41,472 --> 00:00:43,762
I think about her every day.

15
00:00:44,048 --> 00:00:48,722
Dan has a heart condition known as HCM. It’s a… genetic mutation.

16
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,904
Come on man, what are the odds of us even having this thing anyway?

17
00:00:51,001 --> 00:00:51,918
Fifty-fifty.

18
00:00:52,255 --> 00:00:54,968
I’m sorry. I don’t wanna know.

19
00:00:55,194 --> 00:00:57,196
- You like my sister? 
- You know I do.

20
00:00:57,489 --> 00:00:59,121
Stay the hell away from her.

21
00:01:47,556 --> 00:01:50,727
Good morning! Rise and shine!

22
00:01:52,704 --> 00:01:56,313
I slaved, all morning, over the toaster, making my famous raisin waffles so eat up.

23
00:01:56,881 --> 00:01:59,069
Somebody wants to go to that… crummy Formal.

24
00:01:59,164 --> 00:02:01,433
Crummy? How could you say that?

25
00:02:01,499 --> 00:02:06,446
We get to hang out with our friends and get all dressed up and slow dance. How can you not be excited?

26
00:02:06,553 --> 00:02:08,401
Because my parents are chaperones.

27
00:02:08,794 --> 00:02:11,893
Okay, well there’s that. So what? Safety in numbers; I got your back.

28
00:02:12,158 --> 00:02:14,141
Do we really have to go to this stupid dance?

29
00:02:14,258 --> 00:02:15,677
Alright, well, maybe not. I mean...

30
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:19,885
once I get you in that tux, maybe I’ll decide we should stay in…

31
00:02:20,935 --> 00:02:24,729
- Just… don’t leave me alone with them. 
- Okay. I promise.

32
00:02:27,719 --> 00:02:28,958
So good.

33
00:02:29,127 --> 00:02:29,869
My turn.

34
00:02:35,515 --> 00:02:39,254
Think of all the taffeta that had to die to make this thing.

35
00:02:41,944 --> 00:02:45,034
Oh, look! Oh!

36
00:02:45,486 --> 00:02:48,506
Maybe I could just buy it, keep the tags on and return it the next day.

37
00:02:48,558 --> 00:02:51,374
I mean it’s a Formal, I’m not gonna be wearing it for that long anyway.

38
00:02:51,686 --> 00:02:52,511
I hope.

39
00:02:52,915 --> 00:02:54,471
- What do you think? 
- No.

40
00:02:55,433 --> 00:02:56,243
Really?

41
00:02:59,283 --> 00:03:01,009
Just as well, it’s too much anyway.

42
00:03:09,008 --> 00:03:11,598
You are so not my best friend anymore!

43
00:03:11,819 --> 00:03:14,675
And what if I told you I was buying it for you!?

44
00:03:14,844 --> 00:03:17,108
You are so my best friend again!

45
00:03:17,372 --> 00:03:22,632
So, P. Sawyer, thank you for buying me the dress and if you try and take it back, I’m gonna have to bite you.

46
00:03:22,866 --> 00:03:24,597
But what are you gonna wear to this thing?

47
00:03:24,674 --> 00:03:27,398
Oh, I got it covered. I just came on this little outing for you!

48
00:03:27,546 --> 00:03:30,466
Oh. Well you are gonna be the best Formal date I’ve ever had.

49
00:03:30,512 --> 00:03:33,313
- And not Felix? 
- Against the rules,

50
00:03:33,376 --> 00:03:36,005
but Felix… has been kinda sweet lately.

51
00:03:36,081 --> 00:03:39,754
I might have to start giving him the benefit of the doubt instead of just the benefit.

52
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:40,761
Okay.

53
00:03:41,622 --> 00:03:45,395
Hey look, I gotta go to the club and pick some stuff up. But I’ll call you later.

54
00:03:45,728 --> 00:03:48,028
Okay. Thanks for this, Peyton.

55
00:03:48,114 --> 00:03:49,461
Hey, anything.

56
00:03:51,399 --> 00:03:53,203
I don’t hear any shoplifting alarms.

57
00:03:55,450 --> 00:03:56,261
New dress?

58
00:03:56,649 --> 00:03:58,810
My Formal date, Peyton, bought it for me.

59
00:03:59,169 --> 00:04:01,197
I don’t suppose you have a date to this thing?

60
00:04:01,595 --> 00:04:03,131
I was thinking about asking you.

61
00:04:03,349 --> 00:04:05,728
But, that would’ve violated rule number two.

62
00:04:06,562 --> 00:04:11,635
Well, you know what they say – it’s not who you take to Formal, it’s who you take home.

63
00:04:27,579 --> 00:04:30,287
Stay away from my sister… means stay away from me too.

64
00:04:30,401 --> 00:04:32,703
- Just wanna talk to you. 
- We got nothing to talk about.

65
00:04:34,035 --> 00:04:35,720
I’m taking Anna to the Formal.

66
00:04:38,936 --> 00:04:44,383
Look, I don’t have a sister, but I’ve got Hales and I know how protective I am of her.

67
00:04:45,597 --> 00:04:47,686
So I get why those pictures set you off.

68
00:04:48,208 --> 00:04:49,324
But the one you found…

69
00:04:50,697 --> 00:04:52,846
I never even saw it until you showed it to me.

70
00:04:52,949 --> 00:04:54,091
But you had the other half.

71
00:04:54,854 --> 00:04:57,271
You coulda used it to win ‘Dare Night’. Why didn’t you?

72
00:04:58,473 --> 00:04:59,938
Anna isn’t a game to me.

73
00:05:01,130 --> 00:05:02,625
I’d never do anything to hurt her.

74
00:05:06,666 --> 00:05:08,550
Fine… take her to Formal…

75
00:05:08,979 --> 00:05:11,673
but you screw up with her, I’m cutting in.

76
00:05:12,208 --> 00:05:14,049
It’s you and me who are gonna dance.

77
00:05:33,109 --> 00:05:34,761
- Hey.
- He-hey.

78
00:05:34,882 --> 00:05:36,228
I picked up your tux.

79
00:05:37,629 --> 00:05:42,373
- Uh, I still think you should stay home. 
- Oh, and miss a chance of seeing Nathan?

80
00:05:42,756 --> 00:05:46,480
- Dan, the doctor said – 
- It’s a Formal Deb, not a marathon.

81
00:05:48,369 --> 00:05:51,199
Hey, what’s really bothering you?

82
00:05:52,976 --> 00:05:55,147
Karen… is chaperoning too.

83
00:05:56,713 --> 00:06:00,846
How many times do I have to say it? I’m sorry I told her about you and Keith.

84
00:06:01,009 --> 00:06:03,525
Honestly, I thought you would have told her yourself; you two being friends.

85
00:06:03,585 --> 00:06:05,868
That’s exactly why I didn’t tell her.

86
00:06:05,925 --> 00:06:08,491
You lied to spare her feelings, I understand that.

87
00:06:09,094 --> 00:06:11,408
But sometimes lies have a way of catching up with us.

88
00:06:23,681 --> 00:06:24,316
Hello?

89
00:06:24,409 --> 00:06:27,844
Hello, Lucas Scott? This is Doctor Mitchell, your father’s cardiologist.

90
00:06:28,653 --> 00:06:33,650
The doctor I referred your brother to notified me that you refused your HCM test. Can you tell me why?

91
00:06:35,150 --> 00:06:40,471
I guess I’d… rather risk a short full life than… have a long empty one.

92
00:06:40,552 --> 00:06:44,357
Well, with the right treatment, you won’t have to do either one. Look at your father.

93
00:06:44,786 --> 00:06:48,037
Yeah, he practically needs a… twenty-four hour babysitter.

94
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:51,242
Well that’s not true. He’s had a clean bill of health for weeks now;

95
00:06:51,324 --> 00:06:53,138
passed every test with flying colours.

96
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:56,347
I urge you to reconsider Lucas. Please think about it.

97
00:07:08,318 --> 00:07:08,958
Hey.

98
00:07:09,868 --> 00:07:10,438
Hey.

99
00:07:10,831 --> 00:07:12,880
So, I had a little brush with your friend Karen.

100
00:07:13,202 --> 00:07:14,165
She found out.

101
00:07:14,421 --> 00:07:16,859
Hey, look, it’s cool. We’ll work around her, that’s all.

102
00:07:17,201 --> 00:07:19,418
Here’s some bands I think that might work for your club.

103
00:07:20,130 --> 00:07:22,445
Like what you hear, just give me a shout.

104
00:07:22,964 --> 00:07:24,283
I gotta go, alright?

105
00:07:25,942 --> 00:07:28,102
There’s a little something in there… for you too.

106
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:54,244
Andy, that’s fine. Alright, I’ll see you when you get back.

107
00:07:55,314 --> 00:07:58,032
- Andy down-under? 
- Oh, New York for a seminar.

108
00:07:59,184 --> 00:08:01,254
Hey, there she is.

109
00:08:01,587 --> 00:08:05,084
Give my trusty club promoter a sack on the house. She’s earned it.

110
00:08:05,155 --> 00:08:05,780
Alright.

111
00:08:06,583 --> 00:08:07,511
Sup girly?!

112
00:08:07,803 --> 00:08:11,099
Actually, this trusty club promoter needs a favour.

113
00:08:11,233 --> 00:08:12,113
Alright.

114
00:08:12,322 --> 00:08:15,333
How would you feel about playing TRIC next weekend?

115
00:08:15,416 --> 00:08:17,689
And I don’t mean just… one or two songs.

116
00:08:17,796 --> 00:08:20,106
I mean… like a whole set.

117
00:08:20,279 --> 00:08:23,613
- Oh, wow, I’m flattered but I can’t. 
- Why not?!

118
00:08:23,705 --> 00:08:24,715
Cos I don’t have a set.

119
00:08:24,949 --> 00:08:26,123
I got plenty of songs.

120
00:08:26,569 --> 00:08:30,444
Really! See, that’s weird cos I wouldn’t know that. I’ve never even heard him play one.

121
00:08:30,546 --> 00:08:33,331
Ah, but you know, let’s just skip to the track where you tell me you want me to play.

122
00:08:33,423 --> 00:08:35,338
How do I know you’re not gonna screw me again?

123
00:08:35,430 --> 00:08:36,603
Been there, done that.

124
00:08:36,781 --> 00:08:38,742
Are you gonna have a list of crazy demands?

125
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:39,856
Yeah, but just one;

126
00:08:40,345 --> 00:08:41,580
Haley plays with me.

127
00:08:42,025 --> 00:08:44,907
Uh… do you really think I’m ready for that?

128
00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:47,653
Uh, no. But you will be if we rehearse tonight.

129
00:08:47,724 --> 00:08:49,830
Oh, I can’t tonight. Tonight’s the Formal.

130
00:08:49,966 --> 00:08:54,615
Hmm, just as well; I don’t really wanna play with someone who’s not… totally committed.

131
00:08:54,769 --> 00:08:56,679
Not with record labels in the audience.

132
00:08:58,045 --> 00:08:59,079
I have interest.

133
00:08:59,981 --> 00:09:01,537
But you just went off that prom.

134
00:09:06,455 --> 00:09:08,060
Alright, fine, I’ll be there.

135
00:09:15,663 --> 00:09:21,347
Check it out. I got tipped off – Haley is gonna get crowed queen tonight.

136
00:09:21,941 --> 00:09:23,549
Wow, that’s great. Does she know?

137
00:09:23,636 --> 00:09:25,930
No. I’ve totally been acting like I don’t even wanna go.

138
00:09:26,488 --> 00:09:28,837
I’ve actually got a pretty incredible night lined up for her though.

139
00:09:29,611 --> 00:09:32,719
Haley, queen of the Formal. Now that’s hard to believe –

140
00:09:32,770 --> 00:09:37,081
considering… last years Formal, we spent playing miniature golf and making fun of the whole thing.

141
00:09:37,552 --> 00:09:39,170
Now I’m hanging out with you losers.

142
00:09:39,774 --> 00:09:40,358
Hey.

143
00:09:47,167 --> 00:09:49,221
I feel stupid; going without a date.

144
00:09:50,809 --> 00:09:53,706
Events like these are loaded with emotionally vulnerable girls.

145
00:09:54,095 --> 00:09:55,309
Ripe for the picking.

146
00:09:55,707 --> 00:09:58,565
Some other sucker buys the flowers… and you pluck the petals.

147
00:09:59,333 --> 00:10:01,586
I think petal-plucking is more your style.

148
00:10:01,748 --> 00:10:02,834
What’s that supposed to mean?

149
00:10:04,007 --> 00:10:06,551
It means… I want something more with a girl.

150
00:10:07,612 --> 00:10:09,368
Yeah, well maybe I do too Mouth.

151
00:10:10,648 --> 00:10:11,420
Or not!

152
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,110
Hey!

153
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:37,979
Oh, is this your dress?

154
00:10:38,634 --> 00:10:42,648
Yeah. It was my mom’s. She wore it to her Formal.

155
00:10:43,012 --> 00:10:46,161
Ah, so your mom was wearing vintage in the eighties.

156
00:10:46,252 --> 00:10:46,858
No.

157
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,318
I know she would have loved to have seen you in it.

158
00:10:50,932 --> 00:10:51,665
Thanks.

159
00:10:52,135 --> 00:10:54,531
Well at least some part of her will be with me tonight.

160
00:10:55,510 --> 00:10:58,223
It’s gonna be a great night. Just the two of us.

161
00:10:58,826 --> 00:10:59,581
Hey!

162
00:11:00,998 --> 00:11:01,868
Or not.

163
00:11:02,028 --> 00:11:05,908
Its Anna’s first Formal so… I thought maybe we could all get ready together.

164
00:11:06,021 --> 00:11:08,903
- Cool. 
- Besides, Felix is at home, hogging the mirror.

165
00:11:10,645 --> 00:11:13,184
Um… I could use some help with my hair.

166
00:11:15,309 --> 00:11:19,144
What do you think Lucas prefers? Straight… or curly?

167
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:23,414
Half and half?

168
00:11:33,747 --> 00:11:39,548
Dancing where the stars go blue, 
Dancing –

169
00:11:40,106 --> 00:11:42,180
- Nathan!
- Hales, come on, it sounded amazing!

170
00:11:42,267 --> 00:11:46,229
That is a work in progress and you have a habit of sending out things before they’re finished!

171
00:11:46,317 --> 00:11:47,995
Well, you see how well that turned out.

172
00:11:48,595 --> 00:11:50,990
And when… when did you find the time to record this?

173
00:11:51,113 --> 00:11:53,397
Oh just… when you were in Charlotte; over the weekend.

174
00:11:53,853 --> 00:11:57,907
Oh… shoot. Um… Okay, so something’s come up.

175
00:11:59,086 --> 00:12:03,510
Peyton wants me to play the next TRIC night… with… with Chris.

176
00:12:04,277 --> 00:12:06,521
Haley… come on, you don’t need that guy.

177
00:12:06,602 --> 00:12:08,864
He’s got connections and they’re gonna see me play and…

178
00:12:08,952 --> 00:12:12,561
it’s just really important that I rehearse with him. Starting tonight.

179
00:12:13,089 --> 00:12:15,634
- Hales!
- Well, come on, I’m just gonna be a little bit late.

180
00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:17,497
We won’t miss anything. I promise.

181
00:12:18,036 --> 00:12:20,078
Okay? Promise.

182
00:12:32,622 --> 00:12:35,075
So… whaddaya think? Do I like it?

183
00:12:35,152 --> 00:12:38,306
You love it! And… it’s gonna be in here,

184
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:41,331
you know, just in case you need a post-Lucas touch-up.

185
00:12:41,664 --> 00:12:42,884
Stop it!

186
00:12:44,517 --> 00:12:47,695
By the way, your room is… incredible.

187
00:12:47,798 --> 00:12:48,817
Ah, thank you.

188
00:12:51,699 --> 00:12:53,671
So… who’s that?

189
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:56,533
Oh, that’s… that’s Jake and Jenny.

190
00:12:57,384 --> 00:13:00,675
Or at least it was. They… had to move away.

191
00:13:01,315 --> 00:13:02,574
Do you… keep in touch?

192
00:13:02,887 --> 00:13:04,039
No, not really.

193
00:13:04,325 --> 00:13:07,183
I mean, I’ve rung him a couple of times but he hasn’t responded so…

194
00:13:08,273 --> 00:13:09,763
I guess he has his reasons.

195
00:13:11,934 --> 00:13:12,737
Okay.

196
00:13:13,890 --> 00:13:15,984
If you were a guy, would this dress do it for you?

197
00:13:16,070 --> 00:13:17,193
- You look awesome. 
- Yeah!

198
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:17,955
Spin!

199
00:13:24,229 --> 00:13:26,239
‘Dreams… Do Come True’.

200
00:13:26,865 --> 00:13:28,165
Well… One per ticket.

201
00:13:28,841 --> 00:13:30,592
Then I’ll be careful what I wish for.

202
00:13:33,950 --> 00:13:36,112
- Mouth, you coming? 
- Ah, in a sec.

203
00:13:36,194 --> 00:13:39,869
Felix told me to wait five minutes before going in so we don’t look like a couple.

204
00:13:40,381 --> 00:13:41,093
Come on.

205
00:14:05,211 --> 00:14:06,110
Thank you.

206
00:14:09,136 --> 00:14:11,275
Okay, let’s get a table and do a laugh.

207
00:14:11,353 --> 00:14:12,898
Oh, Anna’s saving us seats at her table.

208
00:14:13,893 --> 00:14:17,687
That’ll be cosy. Do you forget who she’s here with? Do you wanna sit with him?

209
00:14:17,768 --> 00:14:19,831
We’re gonna have to if we’re hanging out with Anna!

210
00:14:20,548 --> 00:14:23,492
Keep this up P. S. and I might just get jealous.

211
00:14:23,594 --> 00:14:24,194
Get?

212
00:14:24,995 --> 00:14:29,151
Wow, look at you Mouth. Looking like James Bond

213
00:14:29,247 --> 00:14:32,687
Thanks! But I feel more like I’m about to pull a rabbit out of something.

214
00:14:33,123 --> 00:14:37,603
Well, first dance of the night goes to… Double-o-seven.

215
00:14:38,905 --> 00:14:39,677
Thank you.

216
00:14:48,013 --> 00:14:49,532
I’m really glad we did this.

217
00:14:50,434 --> 00:14:51,150
Me too.

218
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:58,283
I mean I like Anna enough and all… but I feel like I just got my friend back

219
00:14:58,349 --> 00:15:01,574
and now somebody’s horning in on her and I don’t feel like I should have to share her!

220
00:15:01,656 --> 00:15:04,089
- Know what I mean? 
- I know exactly what you mean.

221
00:15:04,305 --> 00:15:06,306
That’s why I love you Mouth; you totally get me.

222
00:15:06,669 --> 00:15:08,379
You’re not like the rest of the guys here.

223
00:15:08,804 --> 00:15:09,521
Thanks.

224
00:15:10,697 --> 00:15:13,663
But, sometimes I wish I was like all the other guys.

225
00:15:14,513 --> 00:15:16,672
- They have dates. 
- Are you kidding?!

226
00:15:16,761 --> 00:15:19,731
Girls totally fall for the sensitive guy. Look at Felix;

227
00:15:19,926 --> 00:15:22,490
none of his lame lines did anything for me,

228
00:15:22,586 --> 00:15:26,826
but what did… was when I got wasted at TRIC and he took me home and took care of me.

229
00:15:42,351 --> 00:15:44,010
You don’t approve of me with Brooke, do you?

230
00:15:44,927 --> 00:15:47,250
‘Friends with Benefits’ is crap and you know it.

231
00:15:47,871 --> 00:15:50,461
Wow. Hard to believe you don’t have a date.

232
00:15:51,726 --> 00:15:52,934
I’m here with Brooke.

233
00:15:54,009 --> 00:15:57,699
Yeah… but at the end of the night… I’ll be with Brooke.

234
00:15:57,972 --> 00:15:58,920
Who will you be with?

235
00:16:02,442 --> 00:16:06,467
Where do you go when you’re lonely,

236
00:16:07,311 --> 00:16:13,655
Where do you go when the stars go blue.

237
00:16:24,791 --> 00:16:25,503
What?!

238
00:16:26,116 --> 00:16:27,080
Nothing, it’s fine.

239
00:16:28,227 --> 00:16:29,435
Okay, are you sure?

240
00:16:29,654 --> 00:16:30,443
Yeah.

241
00:16:30,775 --> 00:16:35,405
The only problem is… you know… labels don’t spend millions of dollars promoting fine.

242
00:16:35,773 --> 00:16:38,544
Radio stations don’t put fine into their rotation.

243
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:40,940
So record execs aren’t gonna come see fine, Haley.

244
00:16:41,201 --> 00:16:42,855
I thought you said you had interest.

245
00:16:42,941 --> 00:16:46,125
I do, and if I had a great demo I can get them to come to TRIC…

246
00:16:46,269 --> 00:16:48,221
but right now the demo’s not great Haley.

247
00:16:48,687 --> 00:16:49,489
It’s just…

248
00:16:50,721 --> 00:16:51,482
fine.

249
00:16:52,685 --> 00:16:56,407
Well… I don’t know, maybe we can just pick it up tomorrow. I’ve gotta go!

250
00:16:56,863 --> 00:16:58,956
Oh, sure… well that’s fine.

251
00:17:03,730 --> 00:17:07,364
Oh hey sweetie, I’m sorry. This is taking a lot longer than I expected.

252
00:17:07,451 --> 00:17:08,475
Well how much longer?

253
00:17:12,734 --> 00:17:16,124
Why don’t you go ahead and I will meet you there not a second later than eight-thirty.

254
00:17:16,216 --> 00:17:16,775
Haley?!

255
00:17:16,893 --> 00:17:17,394
I’m sorry.

256
00:17:17,491 --> 00:17:20,610
What’s the big deal, I mean, so we miss a few minutes, you didn’t wanna go anyway, right?

257
00:17:22,668 --> 00:17:25,207
Okay. Alright, I’ll see you there.

258
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:26,221
Okay, love you.

259
00:17:35,315 --> 00:17:39,185
Sorry, uh… you go ahead and take off.

260
00:17:39,431 --> 00:17:40,695
I’m not gonna need you after all.

261
00:17:55,314 --> 00:17:58,186
Bout time you showed up! Where’s the whip and chain?

262
00:17:58,350 --> 00:18:01,478
Ball and chain Tim. She’ll be here.

263
00:18:01,596 --> 00:18:02,359
Whatever.

264
00:18:02,664 --> 00:18:05,451
So how long we gotta hang here until operation ‘Reets the Beach’.

265
00:18:05,548 --> 00:18:08,308
Until you finish operation ‘What the Hell Are You Talking About?’.

266
00:18:08,446 --> 00:18:10,530
The party man. Your parents beach house?

267
00:18:10,622 --> 00:18:12,680
You gotta get the key first. Remember the plan?

268
00:18:12,763 --> 00:18:13,592
You know it!

269
00:18:14,124 --> 00:18:17,411
Uh-oh Phoenix and Psycho… on your twenty.

270
00:18:17,842 --> 00:18:19,972
Tim… just say my parents are here.

271
00:18:21,651 --> 00:18:24,933
Nathan. Hi Tim. You two look very handsome.

272
00:18:25,302 --> 00:18:27,826
Thanks mom. Dad.

273
00:18:27,913 --> 00:18:30,596
Nice corsage. Where’s the girl to go with it?

274
00:18:31,062 --> 00:18:34,226
Haley’s… recording some music right now. She’ll be here soon.

275
00:18:35,470 --> 00:18:37,774
Well I’m… I’m sure she’s making an effort.

276
00:18:38,670 --> 00:18:40,804
Which means that my first dance is with you.

277
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:44,164
I’d be delighted.

278
00:18:57,128 --> 00:18:58,663
Don’t ask me to dance, Tim.

279
00:19:03,984 --> 00:19:05,310
Mouth?! What the hell?

280
00:19:05,401 --> 00:19:06,614
That’s what I wanna know.

281
00:19:06,734 --> 00:19:09,518
You told Brooke you were the one that got her home the night of the TRIC opening.

282
00:19:09,637 --> 00:19:14,050
So? You took first shift, I was the closer. What difference does it make?

283
00:19:14,127 --> 00:19:15,305
Why would you do that?

284
00:19:17,142 --> 00:19:19,257
The same reason I gave you the money for the dollhouse.

285
00:19:19,355 --> 00:19:20,986
So, what? You’re saying you’re really into her?

286
00:19:21,315 --> 00:19:22,487
It’s like you said Mouth;

287
00:19:23,281 --> 00:19:24,496
I want more too.

288
00:19:25,318 --> 00:19:26,250
With Brooke.

289
00:19:40,576 --> 00:19:43,751
You know, I always thought I’d have the first dance at your wedding.

290
00:19:45,947 --> 00:19:49,531
Sorry. I’m not here to give you grief, I just…

291
00:19:49,908 --> 00:19:51,707
I wanna make sure you’re happy.

292
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,829
When’s the last time you were happy mom?

293
00:19:56,095 --> 00:19:57,601
When we were a family.

294
00:19:58,307 --> 00:20:01,251
And taking shots at me won’t make Haley get here any faster.

295
00:20:02,783 --> 00:20:07,044
I don’t get it Nathan, I try to show some concern… and all I get is attitude.

296
00:20:07,641 --> 00:20:10,990
And Haley abandons you at your Formal and she gets a pass?

297
00:20:11,092 --> 00:20:11,763
Yes!

298
00:20:12,339 --> 00:20:12,996
What?

299
00:20:13,186 --> 00:20:15,880
Whatever. Uh… thanks for the dance, mom.

300
00:20:16,211 --> 00:20:19,693
- The song is not over Nathan. 
- Yeah but… the dance is.

301
00:20:22,843 --> 00:20:27,512
Glow when the stars go blue.

302
00:20:29,432 --> 00:20:30,666
That was good!

303
00:20:31,991 --> 00:20:33,164
That sounded better.

304
00:20:33,431 --> 00:20:34,448
Better than good?

305
00:20:34,864 --> 00:20:36,128
Well, better than crap.

306
00:20:36,227 --> 00:20:39,217
Oh, that’s nice, that’s what I think I’ll name my first album; ‘Better than Crap’.

307
00:20:40,737 --> 00:20:41,822
Nah, it sounded good.

308
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:46,148
Is that clock right?

309
00:20:46,778 --> 00:20:48,146
Uh, no, I unplugged it.

310
00:20:48,448 --> 00:20:49,440
You what?!

311
00:20:49,743 --> 00:20:51,596
You were that close to nailing it.

312
00:20:52,267 --> 00:20:54,592
- What time is it?! 
- Nine and change.

313
00:20:54,719 --> 00:20:58,784
Oh my god! I can not believe you did that. Nathan is gonna kill me!

314
00:20:58,903 --> 00:21:00,530
No, just play him the track. He’ll understand.

315
00:21:00,618 --> 00:21:02,087
No, trust me, he won’t.

316
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:11,815
Having fun yet?

317
00:21:13,428 --> 00:21:14,166
Depends.

318
00:21:15,236 --> 00:21:16,414
Will I see you later?

319
00:21:16,967 --> 00:21:21,181
Depends. Maybe I’ll have a couple of drinks and let you rescue me again.

320
00:21:31,492 --> 00:21:33,489
Hey, have you seen Peyton?

321
00:21:33,576 --> 00:21:35,844
Yeah, she’s looking pretty fine.

322
00:21:36,488 --> 00:21:38,477
No, I need to borrow her lipstick.

323
00:21:38,624 --> 00:21:39,868
Which one’s her purse?

324
00:21:39,991 --> 00:21:43,401
Oh, it’s the fake findy baguette… I mean, I guess.

325
00:22:10,030 --> 00:22:11,137
Hey Nate, you mind standing watch?

326
00:22:11,235 --> 00:22:13,437
Watch what, you mean the lightweight or the flask.

327
00:22:14,770 --> 00:22:16,794
I just thought like… with Haley.

328
00:22:17,209 --> 00:22:18,054
D’ya see her here?

329
00:22:22,683 --> 00:22:24,090
I’ll have what he’s having.

330
00:22:25,109 --> 00:22:27,378
Say a… death wish isn’t it?

331
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:32,017
I can pretend to know what you’re talking about, or you can just tell me.

332
00:22:32,107 --> 00:22:34,925
My cardiologist told me you backed out of your HCM test.

333
00:22:36,302 --> 00:22:38,231
Better than lying about the results.

334
00:22:39,066 --> 00:22:40,156
And what does that mean?

335
00:22:41,902 --> 00:22:43,470
Your doc told me you aced the test.

336
00:22:43,986 --> 00:22:46,402
Guess you were… planning on keeping that to yourself.

337
00:22:47,274 --> 00:22:48,650
Alright, I deserved that.

338
00:22:49,973 --> 00:22:53,541
But I lied because I’m trying to get my wife back and I can’t do that if I’m not in her life.

339
00:22:55,143 --> 00:22:57,176
Sounds like a good way to rationalise…

340
00:22:57,853 --> 00:23:00,791
but even though you can blow the lines, it’s still a lie

341
00:23:00,852 --> 00:23:03,059
- and you don’t lie to the people you love. 
- Is that right?

342
00:23:03,668 --> 00:23:07,145
Well then tell me something – does you mom know? That you backed out of your heart test?

343
00:23:07,597 --> 00:23:09,326
Or is that part kind of blurry?

344
00:23:16,065 --> 00:23:17,135
Can I talk to you?

345
00:23:17,672 --> 00:23:18,680
Yeah, what’s up?

346
00:23:18,828 --> 00:23:21,830
Hey, no secrets… unless they’re juicy.

347
00:23:23,754 --> 00:23:27,538
I guess I’m not used to seeing my little sis… in anything other than a Catholic school uniform.

348
00:23:28,787 --> 00:23:30,309
I think she looks gorgeous.

349
00:23:32,842 --> 00:23:35,413
Wow, I didn’t know this was a lesbian mixer.

350
00:23:39,166 --> 00:23:41,966
Yeah! Don’t be so gay, Peyton.

351
00:23:51,047 --> 00:23:52,095
Care to dance?

352
00:24:17,455 --> 00:24:18,236
Peyton.

353
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:21,871
Oh no. Bad night?

354
00:24:23,014 --> 00:24:25,835
No, um… I’m okay. It’s just…

355
00:24:26,439 --> 00:24:28,440
Not exactly a ‘Dream Come True’?

356
00:24:29,137 --> 00:24:29,885
Yeah.

357
00:24:31,385 --> 00:24:34,795
Well it could be worse. My Formal, I went with Dan.

358
00:24:35,927 --> 00:24:37,105
Well there’s a smile.

359
00:24:38,723 --> 00:24:41,117
Now come on, get out there and have some fun.

360
00:24:41,533 --> 00:24:44,462
You… can’t let a stunning dress like that go to waste.

361
00:24:45,313 --> 00:24:47,374
Thanks, it was my mom’s.

362
00:24:51,288 --> 00:24:54,359
Oh Peyton. Oh!

363
00:24:57,396 --> 00:25:01,542
You know. I don’t know what it’s like to have a daughter…

364
00:25:02,331 --> 00:25:04,794
but I do know what it’s like to be a mother and…

365
00:25:04,875 --> 00:25:07,533
yours would be so proud of the woman you’ve become.

366
00:25:09,546 --> 00:25:13,492
- Oh, I didn’t mean to go make you sad. 
- No, no. Um… I’m gonna be fine.

367
00:25:14,496 --> 00:25:15,396
I know you are.

368
00:25:18,659 --> 00:25:19,770
I know you are.

369
00:25:26,474 --> 00:25:27,434
Excuse me.

370
00:25:28,182 --> 00:25:29,948
Brooke! I need to talk to you.

371
00:25:30,046 --> 00:25:32,652
Um… can it wait, just a second? Cos I’m running to the ladies.

372
00:25:33,041 --> 00:25:34,669
I didn’t buy your dollhouse.

373
00:25:36,436 --> 00:25:41,022
So what, you stole it? Why Mr Bond, you are a scoundrel.

374
00:25:41,106 --> 00:25:45,975
Felix bought it. He just wanted me to say I did so he wouldn’t break your stupid rules.

375
00:25:48,718 --> 00:25:51,319
And after the club opening I’m the one who took you home.

376
00:25:51,430 --> 00:25:54,908
I took care of you, not Felix, me. And I did it because I-

377
00:25:54,985 --> 00:25:56,316
So you both lied to me?

378
00:25:57,074 --> 00:26:00,525
- Brooke– 
- Mouth, I can not believe you, I thought we were friends!

379
00:26:01,723 --> 00:26:06,178
Guess I was wrong. Oh, and by the way, congratulations,

380
00:26:06,234 --> 00:26:08,753
you got your wish because you are just like every other guy!

381
00:26:21,026 --> 00:26:23,837
So I guess you’re gonna tell my mom about me not taking that test right?

382
00:26:24,646 --> 00:26:26,530
Don’t worry Lucas, your secrets safe with me.

383
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:34,447
For now, cos I’m not gonna tell your mother, you are.

384
00:26:34,575 --> 00:26:36,621
I know you Lucas; you’ll do the right thing.

385
00:26:39,022 --> 00:26:41,184
Alright, if I could have your attention please!

386
00:26:41,496 --> 00:26:43,924
- Call me back as soon as you get this Hales. 
- Everybody, if you could gather around.

387
00:26:43,990 --> 00:26:48,000
- I’m starting to freak out a little bit. 
- The votes are in for Tree Hill High’s king and queen.

388
00:26:48,327 --> 00:26:51,433
As you know, over the last week, the student body was asked to cast a vote...

389
00:26:51,534 --> 00:26:55,628
- Nathan! I’m so sorry I’m late. I just… 
- Come on, come on we gotta hurry, we gotta hurry.

390
00:26:55,709 --> 00:26:58,546
Clock at the studio stopped and… ow! Have you been drinking?

391
00:26:58,655 --> 00:26:59,555
Just a little bit.

392
00:26:59,653 --> 00:27:02,590
This years, Tree Hill High, king and queen are… Nathan and Haley Scott!

393
00:27:12,022 --> 00:27:13,823
- Nathan! 
- Surprise!

394
00:27:13,982 --> 00:27:15,543
- But this- 
- Come on, come on.

395
00:27:15,688 --> 00:27:17,572
I told you, this song isn’t ready yet!

396
00:27:17,770 --> 00:27:20,132
I know, but you’re too critical. Everyone’s gonna love it.

397
00:27:21,575 --> 00:27:23,450
I told the DJ to play it if you won.

398
00:27:23,527 --> 00:27:26,374
This is your night Hales. I want it to be perfect.

399
00:27:30,897 --> 00:27:34,155
Wait, is that… is that Chris?

400
00:27:37,033 --> 00:27:39,752
You told me that I was in Charlotte when you recorded this.

401
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:42,173
You were with Chris then and you didn’t tell me?

402
00:27:44,656 --> 00:27:47,089
Nathan, I was going to tell you, I swear.

403
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:51,062
Yeah? You’re a little late. For the second time tonight.

404
00:28:11,409 --> 00:28:15,023
You know, I’m having a hard time getting my head around how you could be pissed at me.

405
00:28:15,571 --> 00:28:18,582
Because you deliberately did something I asked you not to!

406
00:28:18,675 --> 00:28:21,147
Whatever! I spent the whole night waiting for you;

407
00:28:21,214 --> 00:28:24,624
planning everything, dodging my parents… all while you were with Chris!

408
00:28:24,731 --> 00:28:28,535
- Can we leave him out of this please? 
- Why? Are you into him?

409
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:32,837
You know what, it really hurts me that you even have to ask me that.

410
00:28:34,824 --> 00:28:36,579
Not as much as it hurts me.

411
00:29:00,221 --> 00:29:01,252
Still drinking?

412
00:29:03,438 --> 00:29:04,556
Not anymore.

413
00:29:16,262 --> 00:29:18,440
Make sure the door’s locked, okay?

414
00:29:31,486 --> 00:29:32,895
We don’t have to rush this.

415
00:29:34,533 --> 00:29:35,957
I don’t understand.

416
00:29:36,775 --> 00:29:39,939
- Aren’t you into me? 
- Oh, of course I am.

417
00:29:41,941 --> 00:29:46,329
I just promised myself that… I’d be in love next time.

418
00:29:46,631 --> 00:29:51,019
And… I’d really get to know the person first.

419
00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:55,627
And we’re still doing that. And I love… where it’s going…

420
00:29:56,479 --> 00:30:03,615
but I’m… just not ready, Anna. Not yet.

421
00:30:09,006 --> 00:30:10,041
I’m such an idiot.

422
00:30:13,599 --> 00:30:14,629
Don’t say that.

423
00:30:18,178 --> 00:30:22,528
Look, Anna, my parents rushed into things…

424
00:30:24,223 --> 00:30:26,103
look how badly I turned out.

425
00:30:27,987 --> 00:30:34,862
Look, I just… I wanna make sure that this is right. You know?

426
00:30:38,815 --> 00:30:41,836
I’m sorry. I am so embarrassed.

427
00:30:41,904 --> 00:30:45,251
Hey… don’t be.

428
00:30:46,459 --> 00:30:49,219
No, I know I’ve been sending you mixed signals.

429
00:30:50,985 --> 00:30:54,284
First I’m telling you to go slow and then I’m… taking my dress off.

430
00:30:55,522 --> 00:30:57,084
I don’t know what I’m doing.

431
00:30:59,229 --> 00:31:00,242
I do.

432
00:31:03,305 --> 00:31:06,101
We’re going for a walk on the beach. Come on.

433
00:31:07,717 --> 00:31:11,226
Thank you Lucas but… I think I just wanna… go home.

434
00:31:14,807 --> 00:31:17,451
Okay. I’ll take you.

435
00:31:17,978 --> 00:31:18,751
No!

436
00:31:20,421 --> 00:31:22,132
It’s not you, it’s just…

437
00:31:24,138 --> 00:31:27,251
I’m all over the place and I just need to… clear my head.

438
00:31:29,242 --> 00:31:30,199
I’m sorry.

439
00:31:38,711 --> 00:31:39,570
Hey.

440
00:31:51,769 --> 00:31:53,993
Oh, hey Mouth, have you seen Brooke?

441
00:31:54,197 --> 00:31:58,114
Yeah, she’s… ‘Benefiting’ with Felix.

442
00:32:07,024 --> 00:32:08,223
Oh my god.

443
00:32:09,002 --> 00:32:09,911
I’m sorry.

444
00:32:22,787 --> 00:32:24,826
I was wondering when you were gonna share the love.

445
00:32:25,942 --> 00:32:27,294
There is no love.

446
00:32:27,749 --> 00:32:29,792
We don’t do love. Do you know why?

447
00:32:30,155 --> 00:32:32,953
Cos it’s against the rules. But I wanna talk to you about that Brooke because-

448
00:32:33,055 --> 00:32:34,433
You paid for my dollhouse?

449
00:32:34,590 --> 00:32:38,315
Oh, and then you lied to me; about taking me home that night after TRIC. 

450
00:32:39,130 --> 00:32:40,415
- Brooke I- 
- Don’t!

451
00:32:40,814 --> 00:32:44,684
I almost believed you were a decent guy; somebody that could care about me but you know what?

452
00:32:44,789 --> 00:32:47,759
I have been lied to before, Felix, and it almost killed me!


453
00:32:49,289 --> 00:32:50,359
Brooke!

454
00:32:52,738 --> 00:32:55,285
- I’m not like Lucas. 
- No, you’re not.

455
00:32:55,587 --> 00:32:58,362
You know why? Because I am not gonna let you in!

456
00:32:58,490 --> 00:33:02,289
You don’t get to have me; not my body and sure as hell not my heart!

457
00:33:03,276 --> 00:33:04,143
We’re done!

458
00:33:21,857 --> 00:33:22,652
Please!

459
00:34:01,237 --> 00:34:02,035
God.

460
00:34:18,102 --> 00:34:21,748
Listen, I want you to know something; I don’t have feelings for Chris, okay?

461
00:34:22,956 --> 00:34:27,169
The only reason I didn’t tell you about that song is because… I know you don’t like him.

462
00:34:28,557 --> 00:34:31,311
I don’t get you Nathan, you know, you encourage me to do this music thing

463
00:34:31,383 --> 00:34:33,391
and than… now that Chris is involved you just-

464
00:34:33,446 --> 00:34:35,807
- You don’t need that guy, Haley! 
- He helps me.

465
00:34:38,295 --> 00:34:41,561
- You don’t need to feel threatened by that. 
- You think I’m threatened?

466
00:34:42,939 --> 00:34:46,585
I know it must be hard for you; seeing me have something like this

467
00:34:46,656 --> 00:34:48,838
when you didn’t get into basketball camp but…

468
00:34:49,795 --> 00:34:52,217
it’s just not fair for you to take it out on me.

469
00:34:52,329 --> 00:34:53,450
I’ll tell you what Haley.

470
00:34:54,675 --> 00:34:57,224
Go home… and look in my top drawer.

471
00:34:57,946 --> 00:34:59,759
You’ll see a letter, from High Flyers.

472
00:35:00,593 --> 00:35:03,589
Read that… then talk to me about fair.

473
00:35:23,503 --> 00:35:24,523
Rough night?

474
00:35:25,628 --> 00:35:27,074
Yeah, you could say that.

475
00:35:28,641 --> 00:35:31,432
Peyton, I’m sorry for what I said to you earlier.

476
00:35:31,513 --> 00:35:35,041
Everybody was laughing and… I don’t know what came over me.

477
00:35:35,128 --> 00:35:35,835
Don’t worry about it.

478
00:35:35,922 --> 00:35:39,880
No, I do worry about it! We just started to be friends and… I blow it!

479
00:35:39,955 --> 00:35:42,747
It’s okay… Anna, we all do stupid things.

480
00:35:43,238 --> 00:35:45,142
I’ve… done my fair share.

481
00:35:45,614 --> 00:35:50,452
Peyton, at Haley’s slumber party, you said you wanted to be able to talk about anything.

482
00:35:51,030 --> 00:35:55,009
Well… I went into your purse, earlier, to borrow your lipstick and…

483
00:35:55,307 --> 00:35:58,812
It’s okay, Anna; I already flushed it down the toilet.

484
00:35:59,899 --> 00:36:01,834
I’ve only done it that one time.

485
00:36:02,510 --> 00:36:06,201
I’ve just… been fighting it.

486
00:36:13,609 --> 00:36:15,423
Does it have anything to do with this?

487
00:36:16,394 --> 00:36:18,141
Yeah, that and everything else.

488
00:36:20,111 --> 00:36:21,689
I know what you mean.

489
00:36:22,231 --> 00:36:24,669
I made a fool of myself with Lucas tonight.

490
00:36:26,819 --> 00:36:29,415
Why do relationships have to be so hard?

491
00:36:30,937 --> 00:36:33,501
Because the only thing harder is being alone.

492
00:36:36,747 --> 00:36:39,252
Look, you can crash here tonight if you want to.

493
00:36:39,881 --> 00:36:40,655
Are you sure?

494
00:36:42,293 --> 00:36:43,132
Yeah.

495
00:36:44,090 --> 00:36:45,494
It’s nice to have some company.

496
00:37:08,405 --> 00:37:09,664
Is this beach taken?

497
00:37:10,474 --> 00:37:12,112
There’s plenty to go around.

498
00:37:14,590 --> 00:37:17,865
Don’t worry; I’m not gonna ask you if you’re okay.

499
00:37:18,568 --> 00:37:19,387
Thanks.

500
00:37:24,031 --> 00:37:25,255
Know any good jokes?

501
00:37:27,318 --> 00:37:28,619
You’re looking at one.

502
00:37:35,249 --> 00:37:36,995
Why does everybody lie?

503
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:41,131
You know, the bad guys lie to get in your bed…

504
00:37:41,885 --> 00:37:44,829
and the good guys… lie to get in your heart.

505
00:37:48,116 --> 00:37:51,541
And I’m the idiot that falls for it every time.

506
00:37:51,656 --> 00:37:56,804
Hey… Brooke, you are not an idiot. Not even close.

507
00:37:57,986 --> 00:37:59,570
You know who you are.

508
00:38:00,593 --> 00:38:04,494
Most people don’t, you know. I mean, that’s why they lie.

509
00:38:06,257 --> 00:38:10,018
They’re afraid people might find out who they are before they figure it out themselves.

510
00:38:21,089 --> 00:38:22,189
Let me take you home.

511
00:38:23,153 --> 00:38:25,374
I can get home without a guy, thanks.

512
00:38:29,716 --> 00:38:30,566
Okay.

513
00:38:33,368 --> 00:38:34,575
Wait!

514
00:38:37,908 --> 00:38:39,587
I really don’t wanna walk.

515
00:39:00,003 --> 00:39:00,856
Dan?

516
00:39:02,652 --> 00:39:07,061
I’m going back to the beach house. I lied to you Deb; bout the stress test.

517
00:39:07,579 --> 00:39:09,125
The truth is; I passed.

518
00:39:10,359 --> 00:39:12,417
But I lied so that I could keep you near me.

519
00:39:16,806 --> 00:39:19,891
After the meteor shower, I saw that you were slipping away from me…

520
00:39:20,282 --> 00:39:21,967
and my family was slipping away.

521
00:39:23,088 --> 00:39:26,175
And I know now that… nothing’s worth having that’s based on a lie.

522
00:39:26,256 --> 00:39:29,584
You deserve your freedom Deb and in spite of all that’s happened…

523
00:39:31,156 --> 00:39:32,498
I still do love you.

524
00:39:35,063 --> 00:39:36,010
Wait!

525
00:39:37,106 --> 00:39:40,706
You say you want our family to be together again; so do I, Dan.

526
00:39:41,843 --> 00:39:46,210
But damn you if you’re lying; because my heart can’t take much more.

527
00:39:48,181 --> 00:39:49,380
Neither can mine.

528
00:41:15,251 --> 00:41:17,160
So, do you miss being in your old town?

529
00:41:18,447 --> 00:41:19,202
No.

530
00:41:20,839 --> 00:41:26,279
The thing about moving so many times, it’s not the new places that are so bad;

531
00:41:26,828 --> 00:41:31,729
it’s like… not matter where you end up, it’s hard to be yourself when you get there.

532
00:41:45,405 --> 00:41:47,309
So, thanks for breakfast.

533
00:41:48,359 --> 00:41:50,156
We should do this more often.

534
00:41:50,658 --> 00:41:53,489
- Do what? 
- Be friends.

535
00:41:54,185 --> 00:41:55,552
We are friends.

536
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:59,757
But we should be friends.

537
00:42:02,802 --> 00:42:03,893
I’d like that.

538
00:42:06,207 --> 00:42:07,651
But no benefits.

539
00:42:26,585 --> 00:42:30,445
