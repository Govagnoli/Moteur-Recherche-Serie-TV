1
00:00:00,306 --> 00:00:02,083
Previously on One Tree Hill.

2
00:00:02,144 --> 00:00:05,968
Look, I’ve got an opening in my line-up; varsity. What do you say?

3
00:00:06,092 --> 00:00:08,800
So if this new kid is taking you position, he’s no longer your team-mate is he?

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:09,865
He’s your opponent.

5
00:00:09,958 --> 00:00:11,425
I can describe Lucas in one word…

6
00:00:11,928 --> 00:00:12,768
Bastard.

7
00:00:14,009 --> 00:00:15,912
So what if he wins, what does he get?

8
00:00:15,989 --> 00:00:17,315
- He gets you.
- Lucas.

9
00:00:18,017 --> 00:00:20,059
I don’t know what hurts worse;

10
00:00:20,658 --> 00:00:24,755
you and Lucas sneaking around behind my back or you lying about it to my face.

11
00:00:24,804 --> 00:00:29,240
If I could just get up, walk over to you, and tell you how much I need you.

12
00:00:33,841 --> 00:00:34,671
Haley.

13
00:00:35,491 --> 00:00:36,228
It’s okay.

14
00:00:36,525 --> 00:00:40,298
But that’s just like him. To get you branded with his jersey number right about your ass!

15
00:00:40,401 --> 00:00:41,840
He doesn’t even know about it!

16
00:00:42,176 --> 00:00:46,622
You have to right to think of him, not today or any other day of his life. How dare you!

17
00:00:46,878 --> 00:00:48,643
If you weren’t out helping your little friend Karen and her café,

18
00:00:48,689 --> 00:00:50,339
you might have been there for him like I was.

19
00:00:50,384 --> 00:00:51,389
I need a doctor!

20
00:00:51,466 --> 00:00:55,193
I want you out of this house or so help me god, I will stab you in your sleep.

21
00:00:55,244 --> 00:00:56,335
You’re his legal guardian?

22
00:00:56,857 --> 00:00:57,721
He’s my son.

23
00:00:57,845 --> 00:00:59,535
Where you drinking before you drove Lucas?

24
00:00:59,857 --> 00:01:01,833
- Yes.
- I want you to leave.

25
00:01:02,571 --> 00:01:04,408
Were you serious about wanting to get out of here?

26
00:01:04,552 --> 00:01:06,697
I’ve got a way that you can go but you have to leave tomorrow.

27
00:01:06,758 --> 00:01:09,903
- I asked you if you had a problem.
- Yeah, I do, it’s called you bitch.

28
00:01:19,133 --> 00:01:22,924
They handed me the consent forms, he needed surgery. You have a right to be upset but…

29
00:01:23,366 --> 00:01:24,086
Thank you.

30
00:01:24,624 --> 00:01:25,739
I need to talk to you.

31
00:01:26,579 --> 00:01:27,173
Okay.

32
00:01:27,616 --> 00:01:28,739
I think I’m pregnant.

33
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:33,784
- I love you Karen.
- Keith.

34
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:34,899
Marry me.

35
00:01:35,191 --> 00:01:38,551
I thought you weren’t ready. I thought you were going to wait until you got married.

36
00:01:38,758 --> 00:01:39,727
We did wait.

37
00:01:41,114 --> 00:01:42,727
What’re you talking about Haley?

38
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:45,544
We got married last night.

39
00:01:46,076 --> 00:01:48,810
Mom… I want to leave Tree Hill.

40
00:03:35,842 --> 00:03:37,790
You killed me, you bitch!

41
00:04:05,441 --> 00:04:06,631
Hey you.

42
00:04:07,825 --> 00:04:08,501
Hi.

43
00:04:10,635 --> 00:04:12,674
I had the strangest dream.

44
00:04:13,522 --> 00:04:16,124
I dreamt we actually got married yesterday.

45
00:04:16,741 --> 00:04:19,841
That’s weird… I had the same dream.

46
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:21,116
No.

47
00:04:25,878 --> 00:04:28,304
Oh, that’s right,

48
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:32,125
- we actually did get married.
- We did get married.

49
00:04:34,439 --> 00:04:35,325
It’s pretty wild, huh?

50
00:04:36,072 --> 00:04:36,680
Yeah.

51
00:04:37,859 --> 00:04:38,744
How do you feel?

52
00:04:39,256 --> 00:04:41,355
I was just watching you sleep, thinking;

53
00:04:42,477 --> 00:04:44,934
- let’s always be like this.
- Yeah.

54
00:04:48,277 --> 00:04:50,643
And then I turn my cell phone back on.

55
00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:53,842
No! no no no no no no.

56
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:58,001
Argh… it’s my mom. She’s been calling like crazy.

57
00:04:59,168 --> 00:05:00,622
Do you think she found out about us?

58
00:05:00,823 --> 00:05:03,172
No. She probably just wants her car back.

59
00:05:04,406 --> 00:05:06,787
Oh. In that case, don’t worry about it.

60
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:08,471
Gimme that.

61
00:05:22,824 --> 00:05:24,062
Holy cow!

62
00:05:29,015 --> 00:05:30,600
What happened to your head?

63
00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:31,533
Yeah.

64
00:05:32,905 --> 00:05:34,384
I figured; new town, new look.

65
00:05:35,131 --> 00:05:36,976
Okay, whatever you say, Felicity.

66
00:05:37,845 --> 00:05:39,013
At least the town looks nice.

67
00:05:39,751 --> 00:05:40,626
Yeah, it does.

68
00:05:41,997 --> 00:05:43,396
I think we’re going to like it here.

69
00:05:44,917 --> 00:05:45,608
Yeah…

70
00:05:46,939 --> 00:05:50,302
You know, not many people get a chance you know, just to start over you know?

71
00:05:50,605 --> 00:05:52,939
I mean just leave Tree Hill and reinvent themselves.

72
00:05:53,866 --> 00:05:55,038
And it all starts today.

73
00:05:56,278 --> 00:05:56,790
Yeah…

74
00:06:02,404 --> 00:06:03,092
Hello?

75
00:06:54,008 --> 00:06:54,954
Hey girl!

76
00:06:56,118 --> 00:06:58,139
Doesn’t anyone ring the doorbell in this town?

77
00:06:58,727 --> 00:07:01,959
- Some do; I don’t. Let’s go.
- And where are we going?

78
00:07:02,373 --> 00:07:06,410
It is day two of the Brooke and Peyton ‘Hoes over Bros’ reunion tour. Come on.

79
00:07:29,018 --> 00:07:31,151
Come on you fake blonde goldilocks. Let’s go.

80
00:07:41,595 --> 00:07:42,534
Bad news?

81
00:07:43,957 --> 00:07:45,417
My dad’s in the hospital.

82
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:47,438
He had a heart attack.

83
00:07:47,802 --> 00:07:50,054
Oh no. Is he going to be okay?

84
00:07:50,198 --> 00:07:52,672
I don’t know, my mom just left it on my voicemail.

85
00:07:54,074 --> 00:07:56,784
- I’m sorry Nathan.
- Yeah, I gotta go see him.

86
00:07:57,858 --> 00:07:58,980
Yeah, I’ll go with you.

87
00:08:00,450 --> 00:08:01,852
Ah Nathan…

88
00:08:03,101 --> 00:08:05,303
maybe we shouldn’t tell them about us yet.

89
00:08:05,574 --> 00:08:07,848
I mean maybe we should just wait until he recovers.

90
00:08:08,595 --> 00:08:10,075
They’re going to find out, Haley.

91
00:08:10,316 --> 00:08:14,954
I know; it’s just that I saw your dad before the game and he wasn’t happy about us dating…

92
00:08:15,376 --> 00:08:16,633
what’s he going to say now?

93
00:08:17,134 --> 00:08:18,472
It’s not about him.

94
00:08:19,419 --> 00:08:20,894
We’re married now, Haley.

95
00:08:21,570 --> 00:08:22,798
I’m never going to hide that.

96
00:08:28,721 --> 00:08:31,547
- Brooke, what are you up to?
- You’ve been on my dad’s boat before.

97
00:08:31,615 --> 00:08:33,018
Yeah, with you and your dad.

98
00:08:33,366 --> 00:08:37,698
Details. It’s like driving a car just on water and without a speed limit.

99
00:08:37,779 --> 00:08:38,379
Brooke.

100
00:08:38,496 --> 00:08:41,318
Peyton… look at us. Look at this day.

101
00:08:41,404 --> 00:08:44,656
We are practically a beer commercial. It would be wrong not to take it.

102
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:45,894
So let’s go.

103
00:08:50,093 --> 00:08:51,681
Hop on bestest friend.

104
00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:15,303
Is it normal for him to be unconscious like this?

105
00:09:15,379 --> 00:09:20,423
Well, yes and no. Your husband is sedated from the angioplasty

106
00:09:20,511 --> 00:09:25,611
but he suffered major heart failure, he could be unconscious for a while yet.

107
00:09:29,096 --> 00:09:32,173
Would it have mattered if I had found him sooner?

108
00:09:32,359 --> 00:09:34,549
Well in medicine, earlier is always better…

109
00:09:35,069 --> 00:09:37,176
but you called as soon as you could, right?

110
00:09:44,288 --> 00:09:45,118
Dan?

111
00:09:48,472 --> 00:09:51,221
Dan! Dan! Can you hear me?!

112
00:09:51,662 --> 00:09:53,381
Deb? Deb.

113
00:09:53,462 --> 00:09:54,221
What?!

114
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:56,480
You better hope I die!

115
00:10:00,873 --> 00:10:02,286
You’re threatening me?

116
00:10:05,071 --> 00:10:07,963
Here. Dial it yourself.

117
00:10:09,311 --> 00:10:10,084
Deb.

118
00:10:10,658 --> 00:10:14,763
You know; I came here to apologise. To tell you I was sorry,

119
00:10:15,343 --> 00:10:20,472
even though you’ve been the assiest ass on the planet for the better part of our married lives.

120
00:10:21,415 --> 00:10:23,724
- What are you doing?
- I’m considering, Dan.

121
00:10:24,527 --> 00:10:28,127
Please. Help me.

122
00:10:37,959 --> 00:10:38,751
Dan?

123
00:10:48,577 --> 00:10:49,570
I’m sorry.

124
00:11:01,578 --> 00:11:02,308
Keith.

125
00:11:03,983 --> 00:11:04,945
Gee, who died?

126
00:11:06,669 --> 00:11:07,690
It’s Dan.

127
00:11:08,631 --> 00:11:09,702
He had a heart attack.

128
00:11:16,588 --> 00:11:18,550
Haley, have you seen my grey t-shirt?

129
00:11:27,008 --> 00:11:28,974
I wanna do something, okay?

130
00:11:35,896 --> 00:11:36,495
Haley.

131
00:11:37,704 --> 00:11:40,776
No, it’s okay. It’s okay.

132
00:11:56,702 --> 00:11:58,010
I could love you forever.

133
00:11:59,065 --> 00:12:00,073
So could I.

134
00:12:02,684 --> 00:12:04,420
You’re my family now, Haley.

135
00:12:05,252 --> 00:12:06,565
The true thing I have.

136
00:12:09,023 --> 00:12:10,351
I never wanna lose you.

137
00:12:11,706 --> 00:12:12,567
You won’t.

138
00:12:17,248 --> 00:12:17,999
What?

139
00:12:22,212 --> 00:12:23,134
Marry me.

140
00:12:25,323 --> 00:12:27,267
- Stop it.
- What, would you?

141
00:12:27,439 --> 00:12:29,918
- Oh, you’re embarrassing me. 
- Why not?

142
00:12:31,818 --> 00:12:36,605
- Because… we’re in high school.
- So what? I’m emancipated.

143
00:12:37,613 --> 00:12:39,821
Is this about sex, because I wanna wait?

144
00:12:39,984 --> 00:12:44,439
- No, I can see you caving on that one already.
- Well maybe so.

145
00:12:46,389 --> 00:12:50,532
Nathan, couples don’t get married in high school. It’s just… it’s not normal.

146
00:12:50,655 --> 00:12:55,052
So? I’m not normal. What I’m feeling is definitely not normal

147
00:12:55,862 --> 00:12:59,563
and to be honest with you Haley, I don’t ever want to be normal.

148
00:13:00,510 --> 00:13:01,349
Not with you.

149
00:13:04,023 --> 00:13:04,796
I’m serious.

150
00:13:07,151 --> 00:13:08,011
I know you are.

151
00:13:08,641 --> 00:13:10,202
Okay, so I’ll say it again.

152
00:13:11,109 --> 00:13:12,547
I could love you forever.

153
00:13:14,354 --> 00:13:17,377
- Nathan, so could I but...
- So then why can’t forever start today?

154
00:13:28,529 --> 00:13:30,621
Ah, don’t have a view like this in Tree Hill.

155
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:35,584
You wanna talk about Dan?

156
00:13:36,802 --> 00:13:38,045
Do you think my mom knows?

157
00:13:39,453 --> 00:13:40,293
I don’t know.

158
00:13:42,986 --> 00:13:43,939
Think she cares?

159
00:13:45,618 --> 00:13:46,263
Do you?

160
00:13:49,531 --> 00:13:50,498
You know Luke,

161
00:13:52,105 --> 00:13:54,291
Dan’s your birth father and…

162
00:13:55,694 --> 00:13:58,956
even though he’s never been in your life it wouldn’t be wrong to be concerned.

163
00:13:59,582 --> 00:14:01,326
Would it be wrong to hope he dies?

164
00:14:07,067 --> 00:14:11,965
Dan has a heart condition known as HCM. It’s a genetic mutation

165
00:14:12,052 --> 00:14:14,889
and causes the heart muscles to thicken…

166
00:14:15,244 --> 00:14:17,650
eventually; it prevents the heart from pumping blood.

167
00:14:17,807 --> 00:14:18,775
But why now?

168
00:14:18,955 --> 00:14:25,232
Sometimes cardiac arrest is bought on by excessive physical activity, even excessive stress.

169
00:14:32,415 --> 00:14:34,626
I’ve made so many mistakes Deb,

170
00:14:35,109 --> 00:14:36,578
with you and with Nathan.

171
00:14:39,394 --> 00:14:40,771
I’m willing to change…

172
00:14:42,293 --> 00:14:43,414
I’ll do anything.

173
00:14:44,764 --> 00:14:47,397
I’ll do everything to keep you in my life.

174
00:14:50,351 --> 00:14:52,077
I’m not proud of who I’ve been…

175
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:56,608
but don’t give up on me…

176
00:14:57,896 --> 00:14:59,485
because I still love you.

177
00:15:41,889 --> 00:15:42,786
Coach Durham?

178
00:15:45,857 --> 00:15:46,662
Karen.

179
00:15:47,951 --> 00:15:51,417
I always pretend to be asleep when the nurse comes in here.

180
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:56,334
She looks a lot like Death… only uglier.

181
00:15:57,423 --> 00:15:58,499
How are you doing?

182
00:15:58,878 --> 00:16:01,519
Ah you know, they want to operate…

183
00:16:02,032 --> 00:16:05,671
but it’s a long story full of medical mumbo jumbo.

184
00:16:06,173 --> 00:16:07,915
Well I’ve got lots of time.

185
00:16:08,791 --> 00:16:10,730
I closed the café for the day.

186
00:16:11,325 --> 00:16:16,710
Huh… well… I guess your nest is feeling pretty empty huh?

187
00:16:18,334 --> 00:16:19,655
I guess so.

188
00:16:20,301 --> 00:16:22,870
You ever think, maybe that’s what Lucas wanted?

189
00:16:24,028 --> 00:16:28,835
You know, that silence would close in on you and you’d have to go out and make some noise yourself.

190
00:16:30,192 --> 00:16:35,568
Well… I was thinking that maybe I’d take some classes over at the University.

191
00:16:35,793 --> 00:16:38,625
Well stop thinking about it, damn it, and do it!

192
00:16:40,064 --> 00:16:42,076
You know what I’d do if I was your age?

193
00:16:43,945 --> 00:16:45,035
Everything…

194
00:16:46,013 --> 00:16:50,339
and then by golly, I’d turn around and do it again. I wouldn’t give a rat’s ass

195
00:16:50,601 --> 00:16:53,902
who disapproved or what I looked like doing it.

196
00:16:57,103 --> 00:16:57,860
Karen…

197
00:17:02,494 --> 00:17:03,753
take it from me…

198
00:17:05,392 --> 00:17:08,225
when you’re my age, you don’t want to be here…

199
00:17:09,314 --> 00:17:12,197
tangled up in that road you never travelled.

200
00:17:14,399 --> 00:17:15,576
Make some time.

201
00:17:17,901 --> 00:17:19,411
Take a few chances.

202
00:17:29,944 --> 00:17:31,212
Listen, do you hear that?

203
00:17:31,833 --> 00:17:32,681
Hear what?

204
00:17:33,083 --> 00:17:35,298
Silence. It’s nice.

205
00:17:35,610 --> 00:17:38,785
Yeah. At least it was until you started talking.

206
00:17:41,483 --> 00:17:47,104
So what do you want to do after this? I was thinking; maybe some ice-cream, a little lingerie, facial.

207
00:17:47,195 --> 00:17:48,963
It’s okay to miss him Brooke.

208
00:17:49,676 --> 00:17:50,479
Miss who?

209
00:17:51,323 --> 00:17:52,262
Lucas.

210
00:17:54,396 --> 00:17:57,637
I don’t… miss him, really,

211
00:17:57,704 --> 00:18:00,437
I mean maybe a little, you know, now that he moved but...

212
00:18:01,702 --> 00:18:05,353
whatever, there’s other fish in the sea. We’ll find new boyfriends.

213
00:18:05,445 --> 00:18:07,631
It shouldn’t be hard considering you’re you and I’m me.

214
00:18:08,512 --> 00:18:12,254
Yeah. His loss. Jake’s too.

215
00:18:13,514 --> 00:18:14,722
Wanna know a secret?

216
00:18:16,910 --> 00:18:19,090
I was secretly pulling for you and Jake.

217
00:18:20,041 --> 00:18:22,644
Even when I was at the top of your ‘Bitch List’?

218
00:18:22,725 --> 00:18:24,785
- Even then. You know why?
- Why?

219
00:18:24,875 --> 00:18:26,295
Coz I wasn’t into him.

220
00:18:43,596 --> 00:18:45,336
Boys are so easy.

221
00:18:47,312 --> 00:18:50,206
We could swim if we had suits.

222
00:18:50,898 --> 00:18:52,519
When’s that ever stopped us?

223
00:19:08,888 --> 00:19:10,854
You gonna give me a hand or you gonna live in the truck?

224
00:19:12,391 --> 00:19:13,896
Seems like a waste.

225
00:19:15,764 --> 00:19:16,978
We’re going back right?

226
00:19:19,574 --> 00:19:20,962
Why, you're a heart surgeon?

227
00:19:23,281 --> 00:19:24,413
Look Luke…

228
00:19:25,612 --> 00:19:28,677
I want Dan to get better too you know I mean I’m really pulling for him but…

229
00:19:29,512 --> 00:19:33,213
you know my future’s here now, I can’t just… go back.

230
00:19:33,439 --> 00:19:35,871
No I get it. I don’t wanna go back either but…

231
00:19:37,291 --> 00:19:38,569
it just doesn’t feel right.

232
00:19:39,634 --> 00:19:40,326
Okay.

233
00:19:42,077 --> 00:19:43,797
Alright, I’ll tell you what;

234
00:19:45,845 --> 00:19:47,385
gimme reasons to stay.

235
00:19:48,891 --> 00:19:49,649
Keith.

236
00:19:51,005 --> 00:19:53,314
No, I’m serious. Okay?

237
00:19:53,842 --> 00:19:55,010
We’ll make a list.

238
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:58,332
Give me one reason why you don’t wanna go back.

239
00:20:04,324 --> 00:20:06,468
- Dan.
- Ah Dan, see?

240
00:20:06,991 --> 00:20:08,460
Dan’s an ass. That’s good.

241
00:20:11,635 --> 00:20:15,740
- What else?
- I screwed up with Brooke and Peyton.

242
00:20:16,448 --> 00:20:17,948
You know, I didn’t even say goodbye.

243
00:20:18,578 --> 00:20:20,840
Not so much as saying it, I just wrote it in a letter.

244
00:20:22,186 --> 00:20:25,495
- You having fun P. Sawyer?
- Hell yes B. Davis, you?

245
00:20:25,899 --> 00:20:26,584
Yeah.

246
00:20:27,947 --> 00:20:32,395
I’ve been thinking about Lucas. It’s not that he left, it's…

247
00:20:32,531 --> 00:20:37,388
kinda how he left. Just can’t believe he didn’t say goodbye.

248
00:20:39,197 --> 00:20:41,331
Brooke, there’s something that I need to show you.

249
00:20:44,241 --> 00:20:46,056
It was taped to my front door yesterday.

250
00:20:49,898 --> 00:20:50,961
This is from Lucas.

251
00:20:52,753 --> 00:20:54,786
I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have hid it from you.

252
00:20:55,129 --> 00:20:56,086
But you did.

253
00:20:56,968 --> 00:20:59,066
I’ve been carrying around the fact that he left without a word

254
00:20:59,138 --> 00:21:01,248
and you’ve had the words the whole time and didn’t tell me?

255
00:21:01,330 --> 00:21:03,701
- I was going to.
- When?! After you read it first?!

256
00:21:03,782 --> 00:21:05,774
No! I wouldn’t do that, I promise.

257
00:21:07,668 --> 00:21:09,623
Whatever Peyton, we should head back.

258
00:21:18,994 --> 00:21:22,675
Listen, Haley, if you want, I can do this alone. You don’t have to come in.

259
00:21:23,099 --> 00:21:25,700
No, I’m okay. I want to.

260
00:21:26,069 --> 00:21:28,542
Oh good. I was hoping you’d say that.

261
00:21:29,951 --> 00:21:32,153
Besides we stuck together with my parents.

262
00:21:34,041 --> 00:21:35,296
Hey, anybody home?

263
00:21:36,341 --> 00:21:37,554
Mom? Dad?

264
00:21:38,177 --> 00:21:40,242
- In the kitchen, Haley!
- Okay.

265
00:21:45,865 --> 00:21:49,094
No matter what happens next, I want you to know…

266
00:21:50,124 --> 00:21:51,778
if my parents say yes…

267
00:21:52,882 --> 00:21:54,015
I will marry you.

268
00:21:55,946 --> 00:21:58,090
Okay. Okay, yeah I would.

269
00:22:00,666 --> 00:22:01,404
Mom?

270
00:22:02,855 --> 00:22:04,501
- Hey baby.
- Hey.

271
00:22:05,146 --> 00:22:07,220
Well don’t just stand there; give me a hug.

272
00:22:09,497 --> 00:22:12,252
- You must be Nathan, I’m Marion.
- Hi.

273
00:22:14,961 --> 00:22:16,159
Is my mom here?

274
00:22:16,378 --> 00:22:17,730
She’s around here somewhere.

275
00:22:17,838 --> 00:22:19,594
Here’s that article, Marion.

276
00:22:20,290 --> 00:22:25,354
You know, how someone can actually type with their head up their ass is beyond me.

277
00:22:27,613 --> 00:22:31,120
Nathan. Did you climb through Haley’s window again

278
00:22:31,186 --> 00:22:34,064
or did you actually locate our front door this time?

279
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,644
- Mom.
- I came in the front door, Mrs James.

280
00:22:36,726 --> 00:22:38,170
Atta boy. You're hungry?

281
00:22:38,344 --> 00:22:40,545
Actually ah, can we just talk to you and dad?

282
00:22:41,145 --> 00:22:42,997
- Are you pregnant? 
- What!?

283
00:22:43,126 --> 00:22:46,194
- Pregnant, with child, bun in the oven.
- Mom!

284
00:22:46,332 --> 00:22:49,142
Lydia stop. You know that Haley’s a virgin.

285
00:22:49,511 --> 00:22:52,266
- Marion.
- And it’s a damn shame if you ask me.

286
00:22:54,170 --> 00:22:55,901
Can we just talk to you and dad.

287
00:22:58,072 --> 00:22:59,859
Alright, I can take a hint.

288
00:23:01,495 --> 00:23:04,436
Besides, your mother’s going to tell me every word of it.

289
00:23:04,637 --> 00:23:06,572
Call me with the details, Lydia.

290
00:23:09,782 --> 00:23:10,770
Is dad here?

291
00:23:14,692 --> 00:23:17,963
Jimmy! Kitchen! Haley’s pregnant!

292
00:23:21,819 --> 00:23:24,641
- Shall we sit?
- I think we better.

293
00:23:29,435 --> 00:23:30,338
Can I help you?

294
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:32,130
I’m his son.

295
00:23:43,897 --> 00:23:45,095
Is he going to die?

296
00:23:45,257 --> 00:23:48,130
You should talk to your mom. I think she’s in the chapel.

297
00:23:52,091 --> 00:23:56,040
Alright, just to recap on the reasons to stay side, we got;

298
00:23:56,118 --> 00:24:00,828
Dan’s an ass, you were an ass, my new teaching job,

299
00:24:01,304 --> 00:24:04,771
we both get a fresh start, your mother and I laid out my heart

300
00:24:04,858 --> 00:24:06,522
and this apartment has a killer view.

301
00:24:07,592 --> 00:24:08,463
So what else?

302
00:24:09,968 --> 00:24:10,731
Nathan.

303
00:24:12,758 --> 00:24:17,002
Oh. Yeah, that marriage thing must have been tough for you.

304
00:24:17,550 --> 00:24:19,283
No, I meant for reasons to go back.

305
00:24:22,267 --> 00:24:25,517
I was wrong about him. He’s a good guy and…

306
00:24:26,404 --> 00:24:30,736
yeah, okay, him and Haley, it’s kinda weird but…

307
00:24:32,204 --> 00:24:33,279
I’m glad for them.

308
00:24:36,725 --> 00:24:39,577
You know Luke, I’m really proud of you for getting to know Nathan.

309
00:24:40,457 --> 00:24:42,085
If you think you should go home…

310
00:24:42,955 --> 00:24:48,081
then you should but there are… things in Tree Hill that I’m not sure I can face.

311
00:24:49,387 --> 00:24:50,324
Like what?

312
00:24:51,574 --> 00:24:54,814
Just… something I’m not proud of.

313
00:24:57,794 --> 00:24:58,838
Look…

314
00:25:00,313 --> 00:25:01,399
I’m gonna take a little walk.

315
00:25:03,544 --> 00:25:04,318
Keith!

316
00:25:05,259 --> 00:25:08,695
I’m good, I just... gotta get a little air.

317
00:25:17,106 --> 00:25:19,232
- Mom.
- Nathan.

318
00:25:23,559 --> 00:25:24,294
What happened?

319
00:25:26,072 --> 00:25:28,970
I found him in the beach house on the floor.

320
00:25:30,481 --> 00:25:34,305
I called 911 but they said I might have called too late.

321
00:25:35,596 --> 00:25:37,311
Mom, it’s not your fault.

322
00:25:41,699 --> 00:25:45,109
Remember when you were little and you had to have your tonsils out?

323
00:25:45,662 --> 00:25:49,849
I came to this chapel that night and sobbed

324
00:25:50,850 --> 00:25:54,329
because I had the worst feeling that something was going to go wrong;

325
00:25:55,047 --> 00:25:56,720
that I was going to lose you.

326
00:25:58,416 --> 00:25:59,751
You didn’t lose me, mom.

327
00:26:02,676 --> 00:26:05,936
Yeah, we’re here for you Mrs Scott. Whatever you need.

328
00:26:07,017 --> 00:26:08,164
Thank you Haley.

329
00:26:10,145 --> 00:26:11,902
I guess I’m not ready to let go.

330
00:26:20,058 --> 00:26:22,540
We were… gonna tell you today.

331
00:26:23,484 --> 00:26:24,543
Tell me what?

332
00:26:25,095 --> 00:26:27,533
I love your son very much, Mrs Scott.

333
00:26:27,610 --> 00:26:29,847
Tell me what, Nathan.

334
00:26:31,762 --> 00:26:33,006
We got married.

335
00:26:41,915 --> 00:26:43,758
I must be losing my mind.

336
00:26:44,798 --> 00:26:47,347
Listen mom, we’ll talk about it later. When dad’s well.

337
00:26:47,441 --> 00:26:48,981
When dad is well?

338
00:26:49,118 --> 00:26:53,910
Your father is unconscious Nathan, plus he may or may not be my husband at this point,

339
00:26:53,989 --> 00:26:56,907
who the hell knows and now you’re telling me that you got married?

340
00:26:57,803 --> 00:27:00,219
This has got to be a joke.

341
00:27:00,865 --> 00:27:02,133
It’s not a joke, mom.

342
00:27:02,323 --> 00:27:04,397
- Mrs Scott, we’ve thought about... 
- Shut up Haley.

343
00:27:04,831 --> 00:27:08,519
You did this to your father. You’re the reason he’s here.

344
00:27:08,615 --> 00:27:12,041
- Mrs Scott...
- I said shut up. Shut your selfish little mouth!

345
00:27:12,118 --> 00:27:12,912
Mom!

346
00:27:16,583 --> 00:27:18,074
You walked away from him.

347
00:27:19,378 --> 00:27:20,975
And you helped him do it.

348
00:27:22,768 --> 00:27:24,233
You’re both to blame.

349
00:27:41,364 --> 00:27:44,421
Deb, Deb, what’s wrong? What happened?

350
00:27:45,966 --> 00:27:47,164
He’s gonna die.

351
00:27:48,383 --> 00:27:49,136
Who?

352
00:27:50,287 --> 00:27:51,184
Dan.

353
00:27:52,270 --> 00:27:53,489
He had a heart attack.

354
00:27:55,521 --> 00:27:58,669
Oh my god! Oh my god.

355
00:27:59,817 --> 00:28:01,045
He’s gonna die…

356
00:28:02,161 --> 00:28:03,607
and it’s all my fault.

357
00:28:10,654 --> 00:28:11,915
They got married?

358
00:28:13,661 --> 00:28:19,140
- That is not the Haley James that I know.
- You mean the Haley Scott.

359
00:28:20,773 --> 00:28:25,617
I just, I don’t know whether to laugh or cry or… throw up.

360
00:28:26,333 --> 00:28:29,297
I mean Dan’s in the hospital and Nathan is apparently married

361
00:28:30,378 --> 00:28:31,275
and Keith…

362
00:28:32,432 --> 00:28:33,424
Have you called him?

363
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:36,242
Yeah.

364
00:28:37,536 --> 00:28:39,041
Talk about your bad timing.

365
00:28:40,742 --> 00:28:44,259
Oh, it’s just... it would be better if he were here.

366
00:28:44,847 --> 00:28:46,598
Keith is good in a crisis.

367
00:28:49,472 --> 00:28:52,527
How is it possible that they could even get married?

368
00:28:53,741 --> 00:28:58,816
Well, well, Haley James in my house between the hours of 8am and midnight.

369
00:28:59,067 --> 00:29:00,014
Hi, Mr James.

370
00:29:00,356 --> 00:29:03,220
Hello, Nathan. Did you come in through the window?

371
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:04,945
He found the front door.

372
00:29:05,296 --> 00:29:06,690
Nice work Nate.

373
00:29:07,238 --> 00:29:09,973
So, to what do we owe this surprise?

374
00:29:10,505 --> 00:29:12,496
Well, we wanted to talk to you daddy.

375
00:29:13,597 --> 00:29:15,927
Daddy? This is gonna be expensive.

376
00:29:17,719 --> 00:29:22,946
Okay, look. You guys know that I am an extremely cautious person…

377
00:29:23,095 --> 00:29:28,384
and I consider things from every angle and I don’t just, like, jump into things.

378
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:30,677
Like getting to the point of this conversation?

379
00:29:31,011 --> 00:29:37,263
Mr and Mrs James… as you know, I’m emancipated from my parents and…

380
00:29:37,374 --> 00:29:40,089
I think you also know that I respect both of you very much.

381
00:29:40,206 --> 00:29:44,092
I think I know where this is going and here’s the thing Nathan;

382
00:29:44,210 --> 00:29:47,727
you see, if we adopt you, the making out with Haley is gonna have to stop.

383
00:29:47,866 --> 00:29:49,228
At least in public.

384
00:29:49,438 --> 00:29:52,213
Could you guys be serious for like one minute of my life, please?

385
00:29:58,535 --> 00:30:00,256
I’d like to marry your daughter.

386
00:30:09,082 --> 00:30:10,302
I didn’t see that coming.

387
00:30:13,015 --> 00:30:15,263
Dad, mom...

388
00:30:15,402 --> 00:30:18,283
I will discuss this with your father.

389
00:30:18,781 --> 00:30:19,676
You will?

390
00:30:21,422 --> 00:30:23,501
If this is what you want.

391
00:30:27,715 --> 00:30:28,585
It is.

392
00:30:30,318 --> 00:30:31,335
Brooke, wait up.

393
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:33,639
- You shoulda told me about the letter Peyton.
- I know.

394
00:30:33,778 --> 00:30:35,933
Then why didn’t you? Why would you hide it from me?

395
00:30:36,695 --> 00:30:38,406
Coz we were having fun again.

396
00:30:40,125 --> 00:30:43,239
Brooke, having our friendship back has been really, really great.

397
00:30:44,018 --> 00:30:48,292
You know I… I figured Lucas is gone so it didn’t matter what was in the letter

398
00:30:48,354 --> 00:30:50,100
because it was just gonna come between us.

399
00:30:50,667 --> 00:30:51,984
Why would you think that?

400
00:30:54,103 --> 00:30:58,231
Remember when we used to get up every Tuesday morning and ride our bikes to the Mall?

401
00:30:58,317 --> 00:31:00,027
So you could buy some stupid CD’s.

402
00:31:00,109 --> 00:31:02,721
Yeah, and you could buy make-up your mom wouldn’t let you wear.

403
00:31:03,428 --> 00:31:07,087
We’d spend half the day in my bedroom just listening to music and putting on awful eye shadow,

404
00:31:07,205 --> 00:31:09,147
and that was just the Tuesdays.

405
00:31:11,134 --> 00:31:14,595
We used to do a lot of really great stuff until guys got in the way.

406
00:31:16,658 --> 00:31:19,724
I was actually just going to the mall with you to check out Roy.

407
00:31:20,186 --> 00:31:21,342
Brooke, we were nine.

408
00:31:21,475 --> 00:31:22,422
What’s your point?

409
00:31:24,988 --> 00:31:28,013
Okay, I am sorry, I should’ve shown you the letter but…

410
00:31:28,469 --> 00:31:31,290
considering our history, it scared me so…

411
00:31:32,506 --> 00:31:36,068
I just… I just wanted my friend back for a little while.

412
00:31:41,032 --> 00:31:43,293
Come on. God!

413
00:31:57,996 --> 00:31:59,277
Closed during the day?

414
00:31:59,799 --> 00:32:03,306
Oh, I guess my heart just wasn’t in it today.

415
00:32:06,202 --> 00:32:07,954
Come on in, Mrs Scott.

416
00:32:11,504 --> 00:32:15,851
I’m sorry, I really wish you could have been there but it was so sudden.

417
00:32:16,137 --> 00:32:17,013
Yeah.

418
00:32:20,044 --> 00:32:22,522
Is Deb here? I figured you must have talked to her.

419
00:32:22,742 --> 00:32:24,293
She had to go back to the hospital.

420
00:32:27,231 --> 00:32:28,810
She was really upset.

421
00:32:29,614 --> 00:32:31,406
Dan’s not doing so well.

422
00:32:31,671 --> 00:32:34,446
I know, but I meant with me.

423
00:32:35,352 --> 00:32:38,588
- Does that surprise you?
- Yeah, little.

424
00:32:38,738 --> 00:32:43,002
I could understand if it was Dan but Deb’s always been really supportive of my relationship with Nathan.

425
00:32:43,110 --> 00:32:44,625
Yeah, when you were dating.

426
00:32:44,947 --> 00:32:46,058
Is that how you feel?

427
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:48,792
Haley, it doesn’t matter how I feel.

428
00:32:48,966 --> 00:32:50,273
It matters to me.

429
00:32:52,971 --> 00:32:56,561
Haley… I know that you and Nathan are in love

430
00:32:56,647 --> 00:33:00,578
and you know that I was also in love in high school

431
00:33:02,079 --> 00:33:04,982
but sometimes, love fades…

432
00:33:06,339 --> 00:33:10,715
and, I just hope with all my heart that… it doesn’t fade for you.

433
00:33:15,783 --> 00:33:16,421
Hello?

434
00:33:16,908 --> 00:33:19,431
Hey, man. It’s Lucas.

435
00:33:19,851 --> 00:33:20,741
Hey, man.

436
00:33:21,474 --> 00:33:22,892
Crazy forty-eight hours huh?

437
00:33:23,465 --> 00:33:25,536
Yeah, yeah I guess so.

438
00:33:26,742 --> 00:33:28,028
So listen...

439
00:33:29,365 --> 00:33:31,924
I know this is weird for us but…

440
00:33:33,409 --> 00:33:35,611
- I just wanted to call because...
- Oh yeah.

441
00:33:35,928 --> 00:33:39,645
Yeah he’s still unconscious but, you know him,

442
00:33:39,733 --> 00:33:41,842
he’s just waiting to wake up on his own terms.

443
00:33:42,508 --> 00:33:45,267
Well look, I’m here for you okay?

444
00:33:46,354 --> 00:33:47,536
For you and Haley both.

445
00:33:49,359 --> 00:33:50,966
Just call if you need anything.

446
00:33:51,995 --> 00:33:53,062
Thanks Luke.

447
00:33:55,747 --> 00:33:59,373
So listen. How did this marriage thing happen anyway?

448
00:34:00,428 --> 00:34:04,386
The boy’s emancipated Jimmy. Haley just needs our permission.

449
00:34:04,473 --> 00:34:06,475
Need I remind you that up until an hour ago,

450
00:34:06,552 --> 00:34:10,484
this boy came and went through a second story window like a horny cat burglar.

451
00:34:11,451 --> 00:34:15,353
- How can you even be considering this?
- Jimmy, you know our daughter.

452
00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:19,854
She has never done an impetuous, hasty thing in her life.

453
00:34:19,988 --> 00:34:22,947
Most days, she’s more mature than we are.

454
00:34:24,461 --> 00:34:27,053
- They’re in love.
- They’re in high school.

455
00:34:27,232 --> 00:34:31,155
Besides, if it’s meant to be, it’ll still be meant to be after college.

456
00:34:31,281 --> 00:34:34,672
Okay; we forbid her to do it. She hates us.

457
00:34:34,891 --> 00:34:39,198
She keeps seeing him, maybe she gets pregnant, she drops out of school,

458
00:34:39,290 --> 00:34:42,397
- she turns to a life of prostitution.
- Oh stop it.

459
00:34:42,516 --> 00:34:46,784
Oh! There she is, smoking crack and sleeping in the gutter.

460
00:34:49,381 --> 00:34:54,102
Did you know that my parents forbid me to marry you?

461
00:34:55,607 --> 00:34:56,336
Why?

462
00:34:56,764 --> 00:34:58,883
Because they thought that we were too young.

463
00:34:59,196 --> 00:35:00,374
Well why didn’t you listen?

464
00:35:00,528 --> 00:35:02,032
Because I loved you.

465
00:35:02,899 --> 00:35:07,675
And in the end we got married all the same and we’ve made quite a life together.

466
00:35:09,191 --> 00:35:12,467
But I always loved them less for not seeing what I saw in you.

467
00:35:21,981 --> 00:35:24,699
So I’ve been thinking I’m done with boyfriends for a while.

468
00:35:25,830 --> 00:35:29,097
Right. Brooke Davis, solo?

469
00:35:30,019 --> 00:35:32,338
Relationships are just too hard.

470
00:35:32,881 --> 00:35:35,054
Hooking up with boys is so much easier.

471
00:35:40,673 --> 00:35:43,224
So I’ve been thinking, I don’t wanna read the letter.

472
00:35:44,903 --> 00:35:48,896
I mean you can, I just whatever it says, I don’t wanna know.

473
00:35:50,525 --> 00:35:51,456
Are you sure?

474
00:35:53,437 --> 00:35:55,353
I mean it’s not gonna change how I feel.

475
00:35:56,361 --> 00:35:57,509
About Lucas.

476
00:35:58,164 --> 00:35:59,387
Yeah, about him.

477
00:36:00,207 --> 00:36:01,661
Or you, or me.

478
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:06,275
I don’t know, aren’t you tired of measuring yourself by what guys think?

479
00:36:07,524 --> 00:36:12,567
I just… I need to stop chasing boys and focus on myself more so.

480
00:36:17,385 --> 00:36:18,398
I hear ya.

481
00:36:24,091 --> 00:36:25,423
Hoes over Bros?

482
00:36:32,735 --> 00:36:34,020
I hope it wasn’t money.

483
00:37:07,825 --> 00:37:10,638
This hasn’t been going on okay, it just, it just happened.

484
00:37:10,699 --> 00:37:12,241
Listen to me, you son of a bitch!

485
00:37:12,523 --> 00:37:15,742
Those are the last words you’re ever gonna speak to me. You are no longer my brother.

486
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:16,659
You understand that?!

487
00:37:18,041 --> 00:37:19,465
You do not exist to me.

488
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:22,614
Hey Keith?

489
00:37:25,154 --> 00:37:26,530
I thought I might find you here.

490
00:37:30,791 --> 00:37:36,520
Yeah I was just... standing here, listening to that voice in my head.

491
00:37:37,806 --> 00:37:38,738
And what’s it saying?

492
00:37:39,772 --> 00:37:44,088
It’s saying if we leave this place today, we may never come back.

493
00:37:46,099 --> 00:37:47,676
And what’s the voice in your heart say?

494
00:37:49,239 --> 00:37:50,820
Luke, you know that’s not fair.

495
00:37:51,968 --> 00:37:58,076
I mean, you know Dan’s... he’s a bad guy. You said it yourself; you hope that he would die.

496
00:37:58,372 --> 00:38:01,845
I said that for you. I know how bad you want this.

497
00:38:02,007 --> 00:38:04,302
Yeah, yeah I do want this, don’t you?

498
00:38:04,465 --> 00:38:06,565
- Yeah, I do but it just...
- But what?!

499
00:38:07,112 --> 00:38:08,710
Why should we have to give it up?!

500
00:38:10,291 --> 00:38:13,968
I mean he was never a father to you, he leaves your mom when she’s pregnant,

501
00:38:14,035 --> 00:38:16,692
he rides Nathan until he cracks under the strain.

502
00:38:16,734 --> 00:38:21,019
Whitey, Deb, every single life that he touches is worse because of it.

503
00:38:22,145 --> 00:38:25,320
And now we’re just supposed to, you know, give it all up in his hour of need.

504
00:38:28,875 --> 00:38:33,065
I’m sorry Luke but just give me one single reason…

505
00:38:34,005 --> 00:38:35,545
why I should go back.

506
00:38:39,102 --> 00:38:40,444
Because he’s your brother.

507
00:39:13,005 --> 00:39:17,072
Excuse me. Could you tell me what room Dan Scott is in?

508
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:21,179
I’m sorry, he’s in intensive care. Only immediate family allowed.

509
00:39:23,303 --> 00:39:25,914
He’s the father of my son.

510
00:39:28,409 --> 00:39:31,659
The tumour is pressing on your brain and affecting your vision.

511
00:39:31,798 --> 00:39:34,807
So… in the morning, we wanna go in and remove it.

512
00:39:34,901 --> 00:39:38,387
But there are risks involved.

513
00:39:41,588 --> 00:39:43,621
Haley. What’s wrong?

514
00:39:46,199 --> 00:39:50,578
Um… I was just alphabetising our CD’s and…

515
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:53,363
we don’t have any doubles. Not one.

516
00:39:55,804 --> 00:39:57,220
So what?

517
00:39:57,649 --> 00:40:02,739
So, ‘Natalie Merchant’ after ‘NOZ’ and ‘Wilco’ before the ‘Wu-Tang Clan’?

518
00:40:03,138 --> 00:40:06,071
So you listen to crummy music. I can live with that.

519
00:40:07,423 --> 00:40:09,169
We made a mistake Nathan.

520
00:40:10,008 --> 00:40:13,512
- Haley...
- No. I’m not ready for this.

521
00:40:13,644 --> 00:40:17,172
I just... I just really wanna go home to my room.

522
00:40:18,478 --> 00:40:20,752
You know, I’m not a wife; I’m not even a senior!

523
00:40:20,808 --> 00:40:22,804
Haley. Haley, listen this is not a mistake.

524
00:40:22,896 --> 00:40:25,932
How can you be sure because there is nobody that thinks this thing can work.

525
00:40:26,116 --> 00:40:26,844
I do.

526
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:36,399
I promise you Haley. I will always be there for you, I will always protect you.

527
00:40:37,579 --> 00:40:40,812
Okay? I will always protect you.

528
00:40:42,848 --> 00:40:43,570
Always.

529
00:40:48,146 --> 00:40:51,098
Someday, this beach might wash away…

530
00:40:53,094 --> 00:40:56,288
the oceans may dry… the sun could dim

531
00:40:57,072 --> 00:41:01,441
but on that day, I’ll still be loving you. Always and forever.

532
00:41:02,674 --> 00:41:03,888
I promise you Haley.

533
00:41:06,787 --> 00:41:09,152
And now, Haley, please repeat after me;

534
00:41:10,257 --> 00:41:12,356
I Haley, take you Nathan.

535
00:41:17,072 --> 00:41:18,956
I Haley, take you Nathan.

536
00:41:19,596 --> 00:41:22,407
To have and to hold, from this day forward.

537
00:41:25,417 --> 00:41:28,217
To have and to hold, from this day forward.

538
00:41:34,042 --> 00:41:36,727
In sickness and in health.

539
00:41:40,704 --> 00:41:42,503
For richer or poorer.

540
00:41:48,931 --> 00:41:51,340
For better or worse.

541
00:41:55,461 --> 00:41:58,912
I promise, that I will love and cherish you...

542
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:08,436
And will deny all those that would come between us.

543
00:42:18,635 --> 00:42:20,765
I make this promise for eternity.

544
00:42:26,898 --> 00:42:29,362
I promise that I will keep forever…

545
00:42:36,905 --> 00:42:38,455
Until the end of time.

546
00:42:46,501 --> 00:42:48,209
Till death do us part.

547
00:42:48,953 --> 00:42:52,237
