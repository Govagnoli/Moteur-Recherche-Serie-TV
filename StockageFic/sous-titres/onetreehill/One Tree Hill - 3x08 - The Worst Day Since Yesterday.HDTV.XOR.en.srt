1
00:00:00,024 --> 00:00:01,707
Previously on "One Tree Hill"...

2
00:00:02,631 --> 00:00:04,853
I found this website that said sluggish physical performance

3
00:00:04,930 --> 00:00:07,149
is one of the side effects of the HCM medication.

4
00:00:07,234 --> 00:00:09,683
Players have collapsed and died because of this.

5
00:00:09,762 --> 00:00:11,653
You need to tell Whitey about your heart.

6
00:00:11,726 --> 00:00:13,550
I want you to talk some sense into your mother.

7
00:00:13,644 --> 00:00:15,130
Tell her to drop out of the mayor's race.

8
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:16,542
You afraid of competition?

9
00:00:16,632 --> 00:00:17,452
Just talk to her.

10
00:00:17,536 --> 00:00:19,165
That is, if you can catch your breath.

11
00:00:19,681 --> 00:00:21,919
Here's how the fantasy-boy draft works.

12
00:00:22,201 --> 00:00:24,907
Once you draft a guy, he is yours for the season.

13
00:00:24,996 --> 00:00:28,348
She picked Chris Keller, and I picked you.

14
00:00:28,458 --> 00:00:30,159
My date's already dressed for bed.

15
00:00:30,242 --> 00:00:32,331
Looks like someone's horny for a little Chris Keller.

16
00:00:32,412 --> 00:00:36,338
Did I mention that my designs were a total hit over at Suburban Filth.

17
00:00:36,422 --> 00:00:38,298
They might pick them up for a fashion line.

18
00:00:38,372 --> 00:00:40,002
So, she's on a date with Chris.

19
00:00:40,137 --> 00:00:41,506
It doe't mean anything.

20
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:42,572
It does.

21
00:00:42,663 --> 00:00:43,896
She's the one.

22
00:00:43,971 --> 00:00:47,967
Haley still loves you. All you have to do is take her back.

23
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:49,938
Right. Kind of like with you and Lucas.

24
00:00:50,488 --> 00:00:53,328
You see, it's not so easy getting back in the ring,

25
00:00:53,412 --> 00:00:56,086
especially with the one who knocked you out in the first place.

26
00:00:56,397 --> 00:01:01,245
All of the celebrity and all of the applause couldn't fill your void in my heart.

27
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,839
Great time to be a kid, huh?

28
00:02:11,704 --> 00:02:12,875
Chris Keller?

29
00:02:12,965 --> 00:02:14,666
And Lucas actually saw?

30
00:02:14,747 --> 00:02:16,334
Chris Keller Chris Keller?

31
00:02:16,412 --> 00:02:17,576
Stop saying his name.

32
00:02:17,656 --> 00:02:18,659
I don't understand what happened.

33
00:02:18,745 --> 00:02:20,819
When Nathan and I left, you were pushing him out the door.

34
00:02:20,892 --> 00:02:22,656
I know. I know. I don't know.

35
00:02:22,732 --> 00:02:25,383
We were drinking, and I was feeling really lonely...

36
00:02:25,457 --> 00:02:29,396
[...] I think he may have said my shirts made his pants feel tight.

37
00:02:29,588 --> 00:02:34,015
Oh, god, I told you guys I was drinking, but he said a lot of other things. And...

38
00:02:35,373 --> 00:02:39,177
Haley, don't look at me like that. You know how charming he can be.

39
00:02:43,023 --> 00:02:44,561
He didn't, um...

40
00:02:46,398 --> 00:02:49,143
He didn't sing to you, did he?

41
00:02:52,877 --> 00:02:55,751
Oh, my god. You guys, I'm a groupie.

42
00:02:55,853 --> 00:02:57,944
Okay, have you talked to Lucas?

43
00:02:58,047 --> 00:02:59,606
He won't answer my calls.

44
00:02:59,999 --> 00:03:03,850
I mean, I'm not gonna leave a pathetic apology on his answering machine.

45
00:03:05,384 --> 00:03:06,500
I'm sorry.

46
00:03:07,004 --> 00:03:08,020
Sorry.

47
00:03:09,692 --> 00:03:12,004
Lucas is never gonna talk to me again.

48
00:03:18,431 --> 00:03:21,111
Chris Keller always springs for breakfast.

49
00:03:21,867 --> 00:03:24,202
Oh. You have company.

50
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:26,558
I guess we'll have to share.

51
00:03:51,394 --> 00:03:52,964
Why are you making me walk?

52
00:03:53,064 --> 00:03:56,751
You need to clear your head, leave the scene of the crime.

53
00:03:56,872 --> 00:04:01,366
Besides, we have less of a chance of Chris Keller finding us if we're moving targets.

54
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:05,788
Okay, come on. I know you think I'm not trying to help, but I am, okay?

55
00:04:05,869 --> 00:04:08,087
I just -- I don't know what to say.

56
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:11,623
I haven't exactly been miss sunshine for the past 17 years.

57
00:04:11,717 --> 00:04:13,870
You've always been the silver-lining girl.

58
00:04:13,947 --> 00:04:17,082
That was before it was raining men in my apartment.

59
00:04:17,265 --> 00:04:19,616
I really, really messed up, Peyton.

60
00:04:19,696 --> 00:04:22,279
You made a mistake, okay? We all make them.

61
00:04:22,364 --> 00:04:23,601
Not like this.

62
00:04:23,697 --> 00:04:27,186
Okay, Lucas told me he wanted to be with me.

63
00:04:27,279 --> 00:04:28,488
It couldn't be easier than that.

64
00:04:28,579 --> 00:04:30,660
I don't know why you're being so hard on yourself.

65
00:04:30,761 --> 00:04:33,599
It's not like you cheated on the guy. You guys aren't even officially dating.

66
00:04:33,688 --> 00:04:36,644
Another brilliant idea from yours truly.

67
00:04:40,017 --> 00:04:42,050
Brooke, it's done, okay?

68
00:04:42,672 --> 00:04:44,831
You can't change it, but you can fix it.

69
00:04:44,932 --> 00:04:46,573
So just go and talk to him.

70
00:04:46,663 --> 00:04:48,692
He might be more understanding than you think.

71
00:04:48,763 --> 00:04:50,814
He's not exactly a stranger to mistakes.

72
00:04:50,898 --> 00:04:53,512
I can't talk to him, Peyton.

73
00:04:57,216 --> 00:04:59,010
But maybe you would.

74
00:05:00,263 --> 00:05:01,009
Me?

75
00:05:01,125 --> 00:05:05,205
You're good with words and pain and Lucas.

76
00:05:07,145 --> 00:05:08,742
Please, Peyton?

77
00:05:10,529 --> 00:05:11,974
Fine. I'll talk to him.

78
00:05:12,064 --> 00:05:13,441
Thank you. I love you.

79
00:05:13,625 --> 00:05:17,493
Yeah, yeah. No promises, okay? And you know what? In the meantime, keep yourself busy.

80
00:05:17,576 --> 00:05:20,009
Don't sit around and feel sorry for yourself, okay?

81
00:05:20,114 --> 00:05:21,077
Deal.

82
00:05:21,955 --> 00:05:25,477
I want to go by Suburban Filth anyway. At least I have my clothes.

83
00:05:25,701 --> 00:05:27,986
Bet you wish you could have said that last night, huh?

84
00:05:30,037 --> 00:05:31,090
Too soon?

85
00:05:31,715 --> 00:05:32,843
Just a little.

86
00:05:33,678 --> 00:05:35,437
Okay. Sorry.

87
00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:53,980
What? You're here to kick my ass because I slept with Brooke?

88
00:05:54,396 --> 00:05:55,548
You slept with Brooke?

89
00:05:55,642 --> 00:05:56,753
Why else would you be here?

90
00:05:56,845 --> 00:05:58,995
I came to pay for Haley's studio time.

91
00:05:59,312 --> 00:06:00,724
You  slept with Brooke?

92
00:06:00,844 --> 00:06:04,015
I like to think of it as sleeping without the sleep,

93
00:06:04,104 --> 00:06:07,234
but, yeah, until Lucas interruptus walked in.

94
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:09,771
You gonna keep doing this evil crap your entire life?

95
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:11,084
What's so evil about it?

96
00:06:11,158 --> 00:06:13,165
Two kids having fun -- it's cool.

97
00:06:13,253 --> 00:06:16,118
No, it's not cool if other people's feelings are involved.

98
00:06:16,436 --> 00:06:18,174
No, it's still pretty cool.

99
00:06:18,316 --> 00:06:19,949
When you were messing with Haley kind of cool?

100
00:06:20,025 --> 00:06:21,664
No. Come on, see -- that's different.

101
00:06:21,767 --> 00:06:22,567
Brooke's not Haley.

102
00:06:22,657 --> 00:06:23,974
Plus, you don't even like Lucas, do you?

103
00:06:24,066 --> 00:06:26,145
It's not about Lucas. It's about you.

104
00:06:26,576 --> 00:06:28,532
You went out of your way to take advantage of a girl

105
00:06:28,618 --> 00:06:30,857
who obviously has feelings for somebody else...

106
00:06:30,937 --> 00:06:31,888
again.

107
00:06:31,993 --> 00:06:33,900
I didn't go that far out of my way.

108
00:06:34,326 --> 00:06:36,143
Besides, how do you think I feel?

109
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:38,998
I broke my cardinal rule about sleeping with cheerleaders.

110
00:06:39,090 --> 00:06:42,342
I don't, unless there's at least three of them.

111
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:47,022
I'm kidding. Don't worry about Brooke. She's not even my type.

112
00:06:47,655 --> 00:06:49,073
I like singers.

113
00:06:54,286 --> 00:06:56,040
I like to think of that as hitting you...

114
00:06:56,892 --> 00:06:58,121
...without the hitting.

115
00:07:05,231 --> 00:07:07,088
You didn't even give me my money.

116
00:07:08,099 --> 00:07:11,824
All right, it's morning on the hill, and we're talking local politics.

117
00:07:11,914 --> 00:07:14,320
Our guest today is mayoral candidate Karen Roe.

118
00:07:14,406 --> 00:07:17,074
Hello, Karen, and thanks for being here. Tell us about yourself.

119
00:07:17,181 --> 00:07:21,590
Sure.  Um, I was born and raised in Tree Hill,

120
00:07:21,684 --> 00:07:24,034
where I have two local businesses.

121
00:07:24,123 --> 00:07:26,165
I went to school at Tree Hill High,

122
00:07:26,238 --> 00:07:29,883
and I have a son who's about to graduate from there, as well.

123
00:07:29,961 --> 00:07:33,695
Great. Now, tell our voters why they should vote for you

124
00:07:33,771 --> 00:07:36,400
over your opponent, Dan Scott.

125
00:07:36,491 --> 00:07:41,500
Because this town and the people here matter to me.

126
00:07:41,966 --> 00:07:45,459
I find that some people care more about being a leader

127
00:07:45,528 --> 00:07:47,968
than they do about the people they're leading.

128
00:07:48,276 --> 00:07:50,783
And I'm a big fan of the Tree Hill Ravens.

129
00:07:50,876 --> 00:07:52,474
Go, Ravens! Whoo!

130
00:07:52,971 --> 00:07:56,178
All right. Let's take some calls. Our first caller is Keith.

131
00:07:56,264 --> 00:07:59,108
He's an unemployed mechanic from Tree Hill.

132
00:07:59,197 --> 00:08:01,375
Keith, hello, and you're on the air.

133
00:08:01,485 --> 00:08:04,200
Yes, I have a question for Mrs. Roe.

134
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:06,287
I'm sorry. I meant miss Roe.

135
00:08:06,379 --> 00:08:07,986
That's right. You're not married.

136
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:12,335
What do you think about the fact that your business partner is supporting your opponent?

137
00:08:13,167 --> 00:08:15,651
Yes. That is true.

138
00:08:15,935 --> 00:08:19,242
Ironically, my business partner is married to my opponent,

139
00:08:19,336 --> 00:08:24,354
so I will have to forgive her her misplaced vote and her lack of taste.

140
00:08:24,441 --> 00:08:28,847
Luckily, she has a better head for business than she does for relationships.

141
00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:33,061
Speaking of relationships, didn't you have a child out of wedlock?

142
00:08:33,310 --> 00:08:37,546
Right. Well, I like to think of it as a single parent

143
00:08:37,624 --> 00:08:40,451
who is raising her child to be a responsible man,

144
00:08:40,531 --> 00:08:43,139
unlike the boy who fathered him.

145
00:08:46,251 --> 00:08:47,247
Well said.

146
00:08:47,386 --> 00:08:49,428
All right. Let's move on.

147
00:08:53,601 --> 00:08:55,109
What are you, 8 years old?

148
00:08:55,198 --> 00:08:58,480
Oh, right. This coming from a woman who cut the ass out of all my pants.

149
00:08:58,584 --> 00:09:00,942
Too bad the one in my life won't go away.

150
00:09:01,117 --> 00:09:02,207
Good one, Deb.

151
00:09:02,298 --> 00:09:05,638
Before you start getting all high and mighty -- or, in your case, just high --

152
00:09:06,688 --> 00:09:08,737
maybe you should think about the deal we made.

153
00:09:08,814 --> 00:09:10,858
You're supposed to be supporting me in public.

154
00:09:10,927 --> 00:09:13,466
You wouldn't want me going against our little bargain, would you?

155
00:09:14,713 --> 00:09:17,949
What could you possibly do to me that you haven't already done?

156
00:09:23,924 --> 00:09:25,572
Who said anything about you?

157
00:09:32,511 --> 00:09:33,393
Hey.

158
00:09:34,146 --> 00:09:37,829
Just wanted to see how the star player was doing the day before his first game.

159
00:09:39,288 --> 00:09:41,101
Like a rock. Attaboy.

160
00:09:41,728 --> 00:09:43,697
Well, Bear Creek is weak this year.

161
00:09:43,997 --> 00:09:45,290
Lot of scouts will be there, though.

162
00:09:45,385 --> 00:09:46,280
How's the knee?

163
00:09:47,482 --> 00:09:48,542
Like a rock.

164
00:09:49,521 --> 00:09:50,363
Good.

165
00:09:50,668 --> 00:09:51,717
Anything else bugging you?

166
00:09:51,819 --> 00:09:52,963
Just you.

167
00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:54,828
I should have seen that one coming.

168
00:09:56,821 --> 00:09:57,682
Yeah.

169
00:10:04,913 --> 00:10:06,862
This doesn't feel like we're getting out, mom.

170
00:10:08,707 --> 00:10:10,478
It feels more like we're staying.

171
00:10:25,432 --> 00:10:28,345
Brooke, you've got a real eye for fashion. Your designs are gonna be a hit.

172
00:10:28,447 --> 00:10:32,510
That is so great. You have no idea how much I needed good news right now.

173
00:10:32,623 --> 00:10:35,372
So, I mean, what do I do from here?

174
00:10:35,476 --> 00:10:38,150
Well, I think you're scheduled for the afternoon shift tomorrow.

175
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:40,404
No, I mean what's next with my clothes?

176
00:10:40,494 --> 00:10:42,663
When do I get paid? How much do I get paid?

177
00:10:42,735 --> 00:10:46,605
And do I need to, like, design my own label or put together a hot fashion show?

178
00:10:46,685 --> 00:10:48,255
Brooke, I thought you understood.

179
00:10:48,347 --> 00:10:50,502
Since you work for the company, any designs

180
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:53,323
and profit that you made for the store belong to the store.

181
00:10:53,648 --> 00:10:55,756
You signed a waiver when you took the job.

182
00:10:56,775 --> 00:10:58,188
That doesn't mean I read it.

183
00:10:59,402 --> 00:11:03,137
This  is not fair. These are my designs.

184
00:11:03,447 --> 00:11:05,449
They're mine. I get squat?

185
00:11:05,542 --> 00:11:06,522
No.

186
00:11:06,675 --> 00:11:10,729
You get the satisfaction of having designed something exclusively for Suburban Filth,

187
00:11:10,805 --> 00:11:13,512
and of course, your 10% employee discount.

188
00:11:24,482 --> 00:11:26,724
Painting while angry? That's original.

189
00:11:27,338 --> 00:11:28,962
Like cutting your hair.

190
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:35,419
I'm guessing you don't want to talk about it.

191
00:11:35,515 --> 00:11:36,455
Good guess.

192
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:39,671
Well, for what it's worth, Brooke feels awful.

193
00:11:39,838 --> 00:11:41,358
To be honest with you, Peyton,

194
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:44,702
right now, that's not worth too much.

195
00:11:46,588 --> 00:11:48,754
Okay. I know you're upset.

196
00:11:48,842 --> 00:11:50,925
No, not really.

197
00:11:51,404 --> 00:11:56,929
I'm more... disappointed than I am upset.

198
00:11:57,017 --> 00:11:58,998
Luke, Brooke made a mistake, okay,

199
00:11:59,076 --> 00:12:01,496
kind of like we did, and she forgave us.

200
00:12:01,593 --> 00:12:03,728
She has a really funny way of showing it.

201
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:04,875
But you know what?

202
00:12:04,968 --> 00:12:08,134
She made it perfectly clear that we are non-exclusive.

203
00:12:08,239 --> 00:12:11,017
I made the mistake of thinking we were meant to be with each other.

204
00:12:14,323 --> 00:12:16,492
I won't make that mistake again.

205
00:12:27,195 --> 00:12:28,979
You, dude, did you hear?

206
00:12:29,163 --> 00:12:31,862
A bunch of the guys on the team are gonna get tattoos after school.

207
00:12:31,957 --> 00:12:34,347
Since when? I thought we were just shaving our heads.

208
00:12:34,448 --> 00:12:38,198
Yeah, you're the first to hear about it, but it was my idea.

209
00:12:38,309 --> 00:12:39,745
It's pretty dope, huh?

210
00:12:39,933 --> 00:12:40,775
It's stupid.

211
00:12:40,857 --> 00:12:43,703
Yeah, it is. It's crazy stupid!

212
00:12:43,788 --> 00:12:45,690
Got a question, Smith?

213
00:12:51,409 --> 00:12:52,201
Hey.

214
00:12:52,724 --> 00:12:55,236
I thought about it, and you're right.

215
00:12:55,445 --> 00:12:56,948
I'm gonna talk to Brooke.

216
00:12:59,773 --> 00:13:02,217
- Hey, Brooke --
- Okay. You know what?

217
00:13:02,328 --> 00:13:06,296
She  has never missed a game day, so she must be in pretty bad shape.

218
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:08,363
She won't be allowed to cheer at the game tonight.

219
00:13:08,448 --> 00:13:10,607
Nothing really to cheer about anyway.

220
00:13:12,046 --> 00:13:14,519
Oh! Ooh! Old coach guy.

221
00:13:14,608 --> 00:13:17,177
Coach Durham, and shh!

222
00:13:17,267 --> 00:13:19,472
- Okay, fine, but --
- But what?

223
00:13:19,595 --> 00:13:21,542
Well, actually, what I was gonna say was,

224
00:13:21,631 --> 00:13:23,600
why don't you have Nate cut hard to the strong side,

225
00:13:23,686 --> 00:13:25,301
Brandon screen away on pressure release,

226
00:13:25,372 --> 00:13:26,709
and that'll free up Lucas on the wing.

227
00:13:26,794 --> 00:13:29,673
I said "shh!"

228
00:13:34,395 --> 00:13:36,608
You know, actually, that's not bad.

229
00:13:44,556 --> 00:13:47,425
Dude, do not leave me hanging. Tattoos after school.

230
00:13:50,492 --> 00:13:51,510
What do you think?

231
00:13:51,834 --> 00:13:53,876
I think it's still weird that you're a cheerleader.

232
00:13:54,374 --> 00:13:55,463
Purple  flowers, huh?

233
00:13:56,764 --> 00:13:58,092
It looks great, Haley.

234
00:13:58,303 --> 00:13:59,324
So do you.

235
00:13:59,653 --> 00:14:03,336
Yeah. Whitey's new rules -- ties on game day, run till you puke.

236
00:14:03,488 --> 00:14:05,102
Won't that ruin the tie?

237
00:14:06,672 --> 00:14:11,433
I'm gonna take off. I know you have to focus on the game, but this is just mandatory.

238
00:14:11,601 --> 00:14:12,807
You're gonna do great tonight.

239
00:14:12,890 --> 00:14:13,655
We'll see.

240
00:14:19,817 --> 00:14:20,817
Nice locker.

241
00:14:22,115 --> 00:14:24,909
Surprise -- guess who decorated your locker.

242
00:14:25,065 --> 00:14:27,466
Let me guess -- you or Tim.

243
00:14:27,746 --> 00:14:30,432
Well, after our so-called date, I thought you might like it.

244
00:14:30,532 --> 00:14:31,652
It's very you.

245
00:14:31,754 --> 00:14:33,631
Could be worse -- could say "dyke."

246
00:15:07,812 --> 00:15:10,155
Hey, you seen Brooke?

247
00:15:11,597 --> 00:15:12,764
Just this morning.

248
00:15:12,930 --> 00:15:13,936
She was late.

249
00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:16,411
Guess late turned into never.

250
00:15:17,194 --> 00:15:18,387
What, she skip?

251
00:15:18,707 --> 00:15:21,533
Normally, I wouldn't think twice about it, but it's the first game day of the season.

252
00:15:21,611 --> 00:15:22,947
She lives for this.

253
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:26,638
Has she talked to Lucas yet?

254
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:29,931
No. But we have to figure out a way to make her.

255
00:15:30,033 --> 00:15:32,448
We? You want my help now?

256
00:15:32,554 --> 00:15:35,567
Why so surprised? You are the resident expert on making things better

257
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:37,405
after royally screwing them up.

258
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:40,635
That was a joke.

259
00:15:42,598 --> 00:15:43,885
Any ideas?

260
00:15:47,896 --> 00:15:49,687
Yeah, there might be one thing.

261
00:15:50,890 --> 00:15:53,940
For anyone just tuning in, mayoral candidate Dan Scott is here

262
00:15:54,032 --> 00:15:57,096
with his lovely wife, Deb. Good to see you.

263
00:15:57,213 --> 00:15:58,445
Thanks for joining us.

264
00:15:58,535 --> 00:16:02,386
Maybe you'd like to tell our listeners a little about yourselves.

265
00:16:02,472 --> 00:16:06,831
Well, I think most people in Tree Hill remember me from my days in basketball --

266
00:16:06,924 --> 00:16:11,009
either that or driving around in their cars, courtesy of  Dan Scott Motors.

267
00:16:11,716 --> 00:16:13,771
But my platform is simple, Dave --

268
00:16:14,035 --> 00:16:15,595
family values.

269
00:16:16,036 --> 00:16:21,007
It all starts at home with good parenting, loving relationships.

270
00:16:21,158 --> 00:16:23,969
Deb, sweetie, is there anything you'd like to add?

271
00:16:32,028 --> 00:16:34,276
"Dan is everything to me.

272
00:16:34,372 --> 00:16:36,974
I trust him with my heart,

273
00:16:37,070 --> 00:16:39,604
I trust him with my son,

274
00:16:39,944 --> 00:16:45,738
and I definitely trust him with this town."

275
00:16:47,384 --> 00:16:49,606
"There is no better candidate for mayor."

276
00:16:50,387 --> 00:16:53,550
Well, that was beautiful, Deb. I think I'm gonna cry.

277
00:16:53,633 --> 00:16:54,497
Me too.

278
00:17:00,838 --> 00:17:04,485
Is that Lucas Scott, star player of the Tree Hill Ravens?

279
00:17:04,981 --> 00:17:09,107
How about Lucas Scott, star chump of the Tree Hill cheerleaders?

280
00:17:09,202 --> 00:17:10,592
You want to talk about it?

281
00:17:10,751 --> 00:17:12,343
Not much to talk about.

282
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:16,498
The girl that I thought was the one for me went out of her way to prove that she wasn't.

283
00:17:16,598 --> 00:17:18,275
The girl being Brooke Davis?

284
00:17:18,390 --> 00:17:19,651
Am I that obvious?

285
00:17:19,744 --> 00:17:23,770
About as obvious as a black door on the side of my house.

286
00:17:23,869 --> 00:17:25,003
Sorry about that.

287
00:17:25,109 --> 00:17:26,414
Oh, Lucas.

288
00:17:27,515 --> 00:17:28,916
Look, it's her loss.

289
00:17:29,234 --> 00:17:32,596
There are a ton of girls out there that would be lucky to have you.

290
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:35,134
I'll make sure to tell those girls my mom said so.

291
00:17:35,218 --> 00:17:36,833
I'm serious.

292
00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:39,831
You know, a customer once told me that the best way

293
00:17:39,917 --> 00:17:42,909
to get over someone was to get under someone else.

294
00:17:44,735 --> 00:17:47,726
Oh, my god. I just realized what that meant.

295
00:17:48,905 --> 00:17:51,201
Oh, my god.

296
00:17:51,307 --> 00:17:54,225
I thought it was more philosophical --

297
00:17:54,313 --> 00:17:56,149
you know, get to know them. Don't get under them.

298
00:17:56,235 --> 00:17:58,318
- Mom -- 
- Scratch that.

299
00:18:04,861 --> 00:18:08,168
I know that you're going through a rough time,

300
00:18:08,485 --> 00:18:12,538
but you have the game tonight, and basketball always makes you feel better --

301
00:18:12,754 --> 00:18:14,680
well, that and cake.

302
00:18:16,793 --> 00:18:18,435
That was when it was fun.

303
00:18:21,138 --> 00:18:25,659
Don't let your heart get in the way of the one thing you love most.

304
00:18:26,602 --> 00:18:28,168
Just do your best.

305
00:18:36,587 --> 00:18:40,542
It's gonna be okay. Just step away from the cake.

306
00:18:40,652 --> 00:18:42,357
You have too much to live for.

307
00:18:42,488 --> 00:18:43,473
Like what?

308
00:18:43,577 --> 00:18:45,647
We missed you at school today.

309
00:18:45,970 --> 00:18:47,472
I couldn't handle it.

310
00:18:48,542 --> 00:18:52,370
You guys, how am I gonna face Lucas if I can't even face a locker he decorated for me?

311
00:18:52,452 --> 00:18:54,953
Just tell him how you really feel, Brooke.

312
00:18:55,037 --> 00:18:57,921
Nobody in this town deals with their problems head on.

313
00:18:58,012 --> 00:18:58,885
Why would he care?

314
00:18:58,935 --> 00:19:00,645
Because he cares about you, Brooke.

315
00:19:00,726 --> 00:19:02,806
But all he ever hears about is being non-exclusive,

316
00:19:02,887 --> 00:19:05,356
and all he ever sees is boys on your wall and in your bed,

317
00:19:05,428 --> 00:19:08,573
and that's not how you spent your summer, Brooke.

318
00:19:08,656 --> 00:19:11,683
The real way you spent it is locked away under your bed

319
00:19:11,775 --> 00:19:13,473
and the letters you wrote to Lucas.

320
00:19:13,562 --> 00:19:15,145
You told her about my letters?

321
00:19:15,227 --> 00:19:17,103
I can't believe you didn't tell me.

322
00:19:17,184 --> 00:19:20,676
I didn't tell her. She Winona Ryder-ed them from under the bed.

323
00:19:20,764 --> 00:19:22,617
Okay, all right. Not the point.

324
00:19:22,714 --> 00:19:25,639
The point is you need to stop hiding.

325
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:28,798
Just talk to Lucas.

326
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:41,723
Wow.

327
00:19:41,833 --> 00:19:45,954
You're really good when you play against, uh, nobody.

328
00:19:47,037 --> 00:19:48,378
Whoa, where's the fire?

329
00:19:49,210 --> 00:19:50,389
What do you want, huh?

330
00:19:50,474 --> 00:19:51,459
How about a quick game of one-on-one?

331
00:19:51,478 --> 00:19:52,748
Yeah, I'll pass.

332
00:19:52,872 --> 00:19:54,029
Good answer.

333
00:19:54,125 --> 00:19:56,098
And that's exactly what I want you to do tonight --

334
00:19:56,186 --> 00:19:58,586
pass the ball... to Nathan.

335
00:19:59,524 --> 00:20:03,277
Mental note -- Nathan's daddy wants me to pass it to him.

336
00:20:03,389 --> 00:20:04,326
Yeah.

337
00:20:04,456 --> 00:20:05,625
How's the heart?

338
00:20:07,877 --> 00:20:09,678
Medication slowing you down?

339
00:20:10,462 --> 00:20:11,848
Don't worry about it.

340
00:20:11,955 --> 00:20:13,319
Is that what you told Whitey?

341
00:20:15,638 --> 00:20:19,037
Oh. You haven't told him yet.

342
00:20:19,154 --> 00:20:20,545
Well, I can see why.

343
00:20:21,349 --> 00:20:24,521
If he knew one of his players could drop dead at any minute, he wouldn't let him play.

344
00:20:24,746 --> 00:20:27,040
I can't see any reason why he'd need to know...

345
00:20:27,697 --> 00:20:29,235
as long as you do what I tell you

346
00:20:29,381 --> 00:20:30,598
and pass the ball...

347
00:20:30,988 --> 00:20:32,140
to Nathan.

348
00:20:37,379 --> 00:20:39,431
Oh, missed again.

349
00:20:50,857 --> 00:20:52,676
- Hey, I'm --
- Chris Keller.

350
00:20:52,759 --> 00:20:54,737
No need to introduce yourself, son.

351
00:20:54,816 --> 00:20:55,779
Come on in.

352
00:20:59,599 --> 00:21:00,921
Little gift for the wife.

353
00:21:06,515 --> 00:21:08,318
You know, it's nice to meet you.

354
00:21:09,476 --> 00:21:11,551
I'm practically your biggest fan.

355
00:21:12,850 --> 00:21:14,295
You have good taste in music.

356
00:21:14,392 --> 00:21:16,115
Music? No.

357
00:21:16,341 --> 00:21:18,676
I'm a fan of how you screwed up my son's marriage.

358
00:21:18,789 --> 00:21:22,383
You see, you accomplished with one kiss what I was trying months to do.

359
00:21:22,630 --> 00:21:23,664
Nice work.

360
00:21:24,943 --> 00:21:26,077
What can I say?

361
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:27,333
I'm a good kisser.

362
00:21:29,717 --> 00:21:31,504
You remind me a lot of myself.

363
00:21:32,018 --> 00:21:33,513
Maybe I know your mother.

364
00:21:35,367 --> 00:21:38,130
So, you took Nathan's wife. Now what do you want?

365
00:21:38,218 --> 00:21:40,093
And if you say mine, be my guest.

366
00:21:41,191 --> 00:21:42,114
Nah.

367
00:21:42,731 --> 00:21:45,143
I mean, she's definitely a milf.

368
00:21:47,604 --> 00:21:51,820
But  for now, I just need the $500 Nathan owes me.

369
00:21:51,927 --> 00:21:53,307
$500?

370
00:21:56,447 --> 00:21:59,403
Well, since I'm my son's bank, do you mind telling me what I'm paying for?

371
00:21:59,493 --> 00:22:01,549
Haley's studio time. Nathan's idea --

372
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:03,394
I'm helping her record again.

373
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,416
Still my biggest fan?

374
00:22:07,279 --> 00:22:09,283
I didn't realize I was producing her next album.

375
00:22:09,376 --> 00:22:10,733
Actually, I am,

376
00:22:10,905 --> 00:22:12,881
but I could see how you'd want to.

377
00:22:12,976 --> 00:22:14,690
It's gonna be really good.

378
00:22:19,208 --> 00:22:21,432
Make sure you thank me in the liner notes.

379
00:22:25,833 --> 00:22:27,116
Hey, Chris.

380
00:22:28,545 --> 00:22:31,815
Before you go, maybe you want to talk about making some real money.

381
00:22:47,788 --> 00:22:49,385
Heard about what happened saturday night.

382
00:22:50,647 --> 00:22:51,461
And?

383
00:22:51,567 --> 00:22:53,911
And if all this stuff about Brooke is gonna make you play any worse,

384
00:22:53,995 --> 00:22:56,199
you should just take yourself out of the game right now.

385
00:22:56,913 --> 00:22:59,698
Thanks for your concern, but how about you mind your own business?

386
00:23:00,051 --> 00:23:01,666
The game is my business, all right,

387
00:23:01,749 --> 00:23:04,003
and I don't want you screwing it up over some chick.

388
00:23:04,548 --> 00:23:05,772
You want to talk?

389
00:23:06,437 --> 00:23:07,545
Yeah, I am.

390
00:23:07,637 --> 00:23:10,175
See, my game's gotten better. Your game sucks.

391
00:23:10,506 --> 00:23:11,429
Fix it.

392
00:23:12,474 --> 00:23:14,282
Your marriage sucks.

393
00:23:14,801 --> 00:23:15,892
Fix it.

394
00:23:18,951 --> 00:23:20,014
I'll tell you what --

395
00:23:20,978 --> 00:23:24,425
I'll give you the same brilliant advice you gave me when Chris kissed Haley.

396
00:23:26,101 --> 00:23:27,492
Just forgive her, man.

397
00:23:28,164 --> 00:23:29,176
She loves you.

398
00:23:31,908 --> 00:23:33,370
Doesn't help much, does it?

399
00:23:40,727 --> 00:23:43,557
Good evening, and welcome to the sold-out start of what could be

400
00:23:43,655 --> 00:23:46,458
the greatest season ever for the Tree Hill Ravens.

401
00:23:46,541 --> 00:23:50,113
If you're a fan of Ravens basketball, it's got to be killing you not to be here tonight.

402
00:23:50,202 --> 00:23:53,848
We'll head to the locker room, where I'll get a word with the players before the game.

403
00:23:53,943 --> 00:23:57,555
And I'm gonna hide inside the locker room to get a look at them after.

404
00:23:58,232 --> 00:24:00,396
Gigi Silveri, ladies and gentlemen.

405
00:24:06,337 --> 00:24:08,597
Well, well.

406
00:24:08,989 --> 00:24:09,971
Shut up.

407
00:24:10,279 --> 00:24:11,680
I can't believe you were with Brooke.

408
00:24:11,777 --> 00:24:12,908
Are you jealous?

409
00:24:13,322 --> 00:24:15,703
I swear, I thought about you the whole time, Haley.

410
00:24:16,034 --> 00:24:17,217
You're a jerk, Chris.

411
00:24:17,305 --> 00:24:20,034
Careful -- that's what Brooke said right before we hooked up.

412
00:24:20,268 --> 00:24:22,618
Hey, what's up, blondie?

413
00:24:36,097 --> 00:24:37,875
Thanks for picking me up.

414
00:24:38,199 --> 00:24:39,447
Yeah, no problem.

415
00:24:39,535 --> 00:24:42,172
You needed a ride, I got to slap Chris -- win/win.

416
00:24:42,281 --> 00:24:44,113
I can't believe you did that.

417
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:46,700
Sometimes I feel like you want to slap me.

418
00:24:47,844 --> 00:24:50,062
Look, I know I've been a bitch.

419
00:24:50,330 --> 00:24:51,618
You haven't been that bad.

420
00:24:51,717 --> 00:24:54,818
Please. Brooke's been calling me Peyton Marie Sawyer.

421
00:24:55,541 --> 00:24:56,566
PMS.

422
00:24:59,839 --> 00:25:04,222
I'm just -- I'm so tired of everyone leaving, you know?

423
00:25:04,299 --> 00:25:07,686
They all have really great reasons, but it still hurts.

424
00:25:07,823 --> 00:25:09,946
So I guess I've been taking out all my anger on you

425
00:25:10,029 --> 00:25:12,783
because you're the only one who's come back.

426
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:16,006
Welcome home.

427
00:25:17,445 --> 00:25:18,382
Thanks.

428
00:26:12,967 --> 00:26:14,087
Nice.

429
00:26:14,705 --> 00:26:15,619
I don't get it.

430
00:26:16,007 --> 00:26:17,544
Three cheerleaders.

431
00:26:18,004 --> 00:26:20,070
God loves Chris Keller.

432
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:23,679
You're Rachel, right?

433
00:26:23,787 --> 00:26:25,416
You just made my to-do list.

434
00:26:25,523 --> 00:26:30,891
You're on mine, too, under "make fun of pathetic old guys combing high schools for girls."

435
00:26:32,741 --> 00:26:34,330
I don't talk to losers.

436
00:26:34,388 --> 00:26:36,696
Oh, you made an exception with Lucas, then.

437
00:26:36,865 --> 00:26:39,240
You're the Rachel he's using to make Brooke jealous.

438
00:26:39,335 --> 00:26:41,900
Oh. Have fun with that.

439
00:26:42,566 --> 00:26:43,552
Bye.

440
00:26:45,230 --> 00:26:46,171
Sorry.

441
00:26:49,948 --> 00:26:52,391
Dude, check this out.

442
00:26:52,488 --> 00:26:54,004
Nice tramp stamp, Tim.

443
00:26:55,736 --> 00:26:56,940
I don't know what's worse --

444
00:26:57,021 --> 00:26:58,559
the fact that you got a tattoo above your ass

445
00:26:58,638 --> 00:27:00,857
or that it's of a naked baby angel.

446
00:27:00,949 --> 00:27:02,406
It's a cherub.

447
00:27:02,681 --> 00:27:03,901
What'd you get?

448
00:27:03,997 --> 00:27:06,400
Just shaved head, Tim, that's it.

449
00:27:06,804 --> 00:27:08,950
Put your clothes back on, Smith.

450
00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:11,542
I was just showing Nathan that I got my number, 55,

451
00:27:11,575 --> 00:27:14,125
tattooed on my back to support the team, coach.

452
00:27:14,204 --> 00:27:19,778
Oh, well, that's too bad because now you're number 0.

453
00:27:24,192 --> 00:27:25,758
All right, gather around.

454
00:27:30,170 --> 00:27:32,834
Usually, before the first game of the year,

455
00:27:32,913 --> 00:27:36,114
I tell my players to get out there and do your best.

456
00:27:36,210 --> 00:27:41,905
I tell the seniors that this is the last year they'll play as Ravens,

457
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,165
so make the most of it.

458
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:46,271
Well, that's all true,

459
00:27:46,495 --> 00:27:49,136
except this year, there's one difference.

460
00:27:49,598 --> 00:27:53,965
When you leave, I'll be leaving, too.

461
00:27:55,750 --> 00:28:00,579
At the end of this season, I'm retiring.

462
00:28:01,313 --> 00:28:06,145
Now, you boys have worked harder than any team that I've ever coached.

463
00:28:06,239 --> 00:28:10,829
You've got the talent and the desire to be the best team I've ever coached.

464
00:28:10,912 --> 00:28:12,766
I know it. You know it.

465
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:15,638
Now it's time to make everybody else know it.

466
00:28:15,735 --> 00:28:20,330
So I want you to go out there and start this season like champions

467
00:28:20,415 --> 00:28:23,168
because that is how I intend to end it.

468
00:28:23,251 --> 00:28:24,166
Let's go.

469
00:28:28,929 --> 00:28:29,782
Hey.

470
00:28:30,804 --> 00:28:33,801
Now if you screw us, you screw Whitey, too.

471
00:29:28,125 --> 00:29:34,220
Starting for your Tree Hill Ravens, at point guard, number 0, Tim Smith.

472
00:29:34,478 --> 00:29:37,589
At center, number 32, Jabar Kelley.

473
00:29:37,691 --> 00:29:41,224
At power forward, number 12, Brandon Roth.

474
00:29:41,442 --> 00:29:45,844
At shooting guard, co-captain, number 3, Lucas Scott.

475
00:29:47,106 --> 00:29:50,389
And finally, co-captain and last year's league high scorer,

476
00:29:50,477 --> 00:29:54,375
at small forward, number 23, Nathan Scott.

477
00:30:02,739 --> 00:30:07,476
And now, to sing our national anthem, straight off his tour, Tree Hill's own

478
00:30:07,649 --> 00:30:08,742
Chris Keller.

479
00:30:13,695 --> 00:30:15,086
Thank you, Tree Hill.

480
00:30:16,210 --> 00:30:18,178
This goes out to all your girlfriends.

481
00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:19,628
You know who you are.

482
00:30:20,958 --> 00:30:22,478
I hate that guy.

483
00:30:22,558 --> 00:30:26,878
# Oh, say can you see #

484
00:30:27,058 --> 00:30:32,008
# By the dawn's early light #

485
00:30:34,774 --> 00:30:35,913
Where the hell have you been?

486
00:30:36,001 --> 00:30:37,450
You know we need to make an entrance as a couple.

487
00:30:37,505 --> 00:30:40,645
Oh, sorry, Dan. I was cleaning upshards of glass from the vase

488
00:30:40,716 --> 00:30:43,001
that fell off a door and nearly killed me.

489
00:30:43,246 --> 00:30:44,961
Well, as long as you're okay.

490
00:30:45,056 --> 00:30:47,127
I'm more than okay.

491
00:30:47,682 --> 00:30:50,865
According to the radio, Karen's making quite a comeback in the polls.

492
00:30:50,951 --> 00:30:54,129
Apparently, a lot of people think you come across as egotistical.

493
00:30:54,227 --> 00:30:55,505
Imagine that.

494
00:30:55,656 --> 00:30:57,470
Maybe she'll win after all.

495
00:30:58,699 --> 00:31:00,604
That vase must have hit you pretty hard.

496
00:31:00,689 --> 00:31:02,787
Now, stick out your chest and try and look pretty.

497
00:31:02,869 --> 00:31:04,017
The public's waiting.

498
00:31:08,895 --> 00:31:11,741
Aw, yeah, it's Tim time up in here, baby.

499
00:31:35,571 --> 00:31:38,649
Hey, quit looking at Chris Keller. We already know he can score.

500
00:32:43,271 --> 00:32:46,736
Scott having a little bit of trouble. He's not looking too good right now.

501
00:32:46,899 --> 00:32:49,010
Oh, he's looking good.

502
00:33:23,571 --> 00:33:25,012
I'm open, Nathan! Ball!

503
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:26,600
Ball!

504
00:33:32,393 --> 00:33:34,306
Best pick you made all night.

505
00:33:40,564 --> 00:33:43,098
Well, you can forget that undefeated season, folks.

506
00:33:43,177 --> 00:33:45,336
The Ravens have lost their first game.

507
00:33:59,615 --> 00:34:02,703
Well, so much for an undefeated season, huh, ladies?

508
00:34:02,812 --> 00:34:04,189
Get out of here, dad.

509
00:34:04,934 --> 00:34:06,697
It's not your locker room anymore.

510
00:34:06,791 --> 00:34:08,608
Just find a job as a janitor.

511
00:34:09,195 --> 00:34:12,062
16 points, Nathan -- impressive.

512
00:34:12,152 --> 00:34:15,155
The Scouts are thrilled, especially the deaf and blind ones.

513
00:34:16,593 --> 00:34:18,258
What a joke.

514
00:34:18,738 --> 00:34:20,498
You're all a joke.

515
00:34:21,498 --> 00:34:23,909
And it seems my mistake is the punch line.

516
00:34:25,026 --> 00:34:26,471
You're the punch line, dad.

517
00:34:30,681 --> 00:34:32,625
Get out of here, Danny.

518
00:34:33,130 --> 00:34:35,277
Just a little father-son chat, Whitey.

519
00:34:35,359 --> 00:34:39,461
You get out of here right now before they have to carry you out.

520
00:34:48,008 --> 00:34:49,318
0-1.

521
00:34:49,865 --> 00:34:51,456
Keep up the good work.

522
00:34:58,410 --> 00:35:01,291
Practice, 5:00 a.m. sharp.

523
00:35:01,607 --> 00:35:04,667
Now hit the showers. You guys stink.

524
00:35:19,052 --> 00:35:19,953
Luke.

525
00:35:24,052 --> 00:35:25,567
Hey, can I get a ride?

526
00:35:25,628 --> 00:35:27,220
Yeah, let's go.

527
00:35:42,850 --> 00:35:45,560
Let me be the first to say great game.

528
00:35:45,885 --> 00:35:48,660
I am the first, right, because, I mean, wow.

529
00:35:48,791 --> 00:35:51,017
You guys really sucked.

530
00:35:51,419 --> 00:35:52,787
My head wasn't in it.

531
00:35:53,002 --> 00:35:53,970
I know.

532
00:35:54,071 --> 00:35:57,642
It was in Brooke's bedroom, watching her ride Chris Keller.

533
00:36:00,632 --> 00:36:02,022
You heard about that.

534
00:36:02,916 --> 00:36:06,117
I'm not one of those people who likes to say "I told you so," Lucas.

535
00:36:06,224 --> 00:36:06,962
Yeah.

536
00:36:07,061 --> 00:36:08,718
Who am I kidding? I love it.

537
00:36:08,818 --> 00:36:09,967
I told you.

538
00:36:11,863 --> 00:36:13,303
You need to move on, Lucas.

539
00:36:13,390 --> 00:36:15,672
To what, Rachel -- you?

540
00:36:20,628 --> 00:36:23,095
To whatever makes you happy. But do it now.

541
00:36:23,196 --> 00:36:26,507
Live life for the moment because everything else is uncertain.

542
00:36:26,639 --> 00:36:28,895
Take advantage of what's right in front of you.

543
00:36:29,955 --> 00:36:32,079
I'm not hooking up with you tonight, Rachel.

544
00:36:32,351 --> 00:36:34,241
That is not even what I'm talking about.

545
00:36:34,332 --> 00:36:36,080
And it's me who's not hooking up with you,

546
00:36:36,187 --> 00:36:39,439
and it's also me who's not gonna be used to make Brooke jealous anymore.

547
00:36:39,899 --> 00:36:41,327
I'm better than that,

548
00:36:41,446 --> 00:36:42,776
and I know it.

549
00:36:43,363 --> 00:36:46,015
And you can figure it out, too, on your long walk home.

550
00:36:46,473 --> 00:36:48,030
Look, Rachel, come on.

551
00:36:48,126 --> 00:36:49,413
Out you go.

552
00:36:58,060 --> 00:36:59,068
See you at school.

553
00:37:15,601 --> 00:37:19,454
Well, that doesn't look like the face of someone who had a good talk with Lucas.

554
00:37:19,906 --> 00:37:22,120
Then it's a fitting face for me.

555
00:37:22,462 --> 00:37:23,758
Didn't go well?

556
00:37:24,115 --> 00:37:25,516
It didn't go.

557
00:37:26,058 --> 00:37:27,526
He left with Rachel.

558
00:37:29,426 --> 00:37:30,734
I'm sorry, Brooke.

559
00:37:31,091 --> 00:37:32,235
Why am I like this, Peyton?

560
00:37:32,316 --> 00:37:35,143
How come I only realize what I want when I don't have it anymore?

561
00:37:35,244 --> 00:37:37,355
Lucas didn't realize what he had when you two were together.

562
00:37:37,443 --> 00:37:40,172
People are like that sometimes.

563
00:37:40,263 --> 00:37:41,759
Rachel's not.

564
00:37:41,853 --> 00:37:43,983
She knew she wanted Lucas, and she got him.

565
00:37:44,076 --> 00:37:46,085
She's probably gonna take my squad from me, too.

566
00:37:46,191 --> 00:37:50,334
No. Hey, nobody can take anything from you unless you let them.

567
00:37:50,447 --> 00:37:53,031
Really? Tell that to the thieves at Suburban Filth.

568
00:37:53,135 --> 00:37:54,523
Yeah, about that --

569
00:37:54,690 --> 00:37:57,427
let's go see our filthy friends at the mall.

570
00:37:57,522 --> 00:37:58,693
No way.

571
00:37:58,785 --> 00:38:01,875
Those are the last people I want to talk to right now.

572
00:38:03,352 --> 00:38:05,652
Not exactly what I had in mind.

573
00:38:16,136 --> 00:38:16,960
Hey.

574
00:38:17,741 --> 00:38:19,101
You did a good job tonight.

575
00:38:19,850 --> 00:38:21,023
What game were you watching?

576
00:38:21,297 --> 00:38:23,265
The game where you had the entire team guarding you

577
00:38:23,353 --> 00:38:24,979
and you still made like 30 points.

578
00:38:25,086 --> 00:38:27,647
16, Haley. The whole team only had 39.

579
00:38:27,745 --> 00:38:28,965
Well, it's almost half.

580
00:38:29,064 --> 00:38:30,797
Plus, I gave you more 'cause your shots were really hard.

581
00:38:30,884 --> 00:38:32,314
That should totally be a rule.

582
00:38:32,419 --> 00:38:34,500
- It doesn't work that way.
- Well, it should.

583
00:38:35,258 --> 00:38:36,124
Thank you.

584
00:38:38,867 --> 00:38:40,101
Did you wait out here for me?

585
00:38:40,196 --> 00:38:41,073
Yeah.

586
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:43,519
I just wanted to make sure you were okay.

587
00:38:45,364 --> 00:38:46,170
Are you?

588
00:38:47,478 --> 00:38:48,361
Not really.

589
00:38:48,695 --> 00:38:53,075
But I do this thing when I play like crap where I walk home alone

590
00:38:53,164 --> 00:38:54,969
and try to let go of it along the way.

591
00:38:55,445 --> 00:38:56,450
Okay.

592
00:38:57,213 --> 00:38:59,617
Call me later if you want to talk or...

593
00:39:01,058 --> 00:39:01,997
Okay.

594
00:39:34,731 --> 00:39:36,108
Hey, what do you think you're doing?

595
00:39:36,206 --> 00:39:38,564
Taking my clothes back. You can keep the naked manikins.

596
00:39:38,667 --> 00:39:39,972
- That's stealing. 
- Oh, really?

597
00:39:40,044 --> 00:39:41,105
Like kind of what you did to me?

598
00:39:41,185 --> 00:39:44,225
Just think of it as me getting my 10% discount 10 times in a row.

599
00:39:44,308 --> 00:39:45,222
Nice math.

600
00:39:53,318 --> 00:39:54,660
Hi, mayor Roe.

601
00:39:55,550 --> 00:39:58,458
You might be the only person who will ever call me that.

602
00:39:58,538 --> 00:40:00,046
I wouldn't be so sure.

603
00:40:08,648 --> 00:40:10,942
Not very mayoral, is it?

604
00:40:19,659 --> 00:40:21,738

00:40:24,076 --> 00:40:27,007
You must fight it out or perish.

607
00:40:27,692 --> 00:40:29,453
And if that be so,

608
00:40:30,605 --> 00:40:31,790
why not now

609
00:40:32,307 --> 00:40:33,937
and where you stand?"
