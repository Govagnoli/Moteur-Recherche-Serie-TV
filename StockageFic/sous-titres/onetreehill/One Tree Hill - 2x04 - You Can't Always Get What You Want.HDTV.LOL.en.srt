1
00:00:01,066 --> 00:00:02,495
Previously on One Tree Hill.

2
00:00:02,551 --> 00:00:03,652
I’m glad you came son.

3
00:00:03,908 --> 00:00:06,205
I wanna do something I shoulda done a long time ago.

4
00:00:06,263 --> 00:00:07,267
Went to go see Dan.

5
00:00:07,354 --> 00:00:08,664
What did he say this time?

6
00:00:09,248 --> 00:00:10,537
That he was sorry.

7
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:12,878
Before the proposal we were friends Keith,

8
00:00:12,918 --> 00:00:15,366
I mean can’t we at least try to go back to the way we were then?

9
00:00:15,951 --> 00:00:17,009
I don’t think so.

10
00:00:17,311 --> 00:00:20,634
My doctor’s put me through some cardiovascular rehab; I thought you might like to join me.

11
00:00:20,794 --> 00:00:22,315
So you wanna be workout buddies?

12
00:00:22,611 --> 00:00:25,411
Give us a chance to spend some time together. Get to know you.

13
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,276
You had my whole life to do that.

14
00:00:27,578 --> 00:00:29,021
I thought the divorce went through.

15
00:00:29,544 --> 00:00:33,815
Well technically no, Dan had the heart attack before signing the papers.

16
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:36,493
While signing the papers actually.

17
00:00:37,633 --> 00:00:39,348
Look, would you do me a favour

18
00:00:39,476 --> 00:00:43,056
and put a copy of this in the lockbox in my bottom desk drawer?

19
00:00:53,921 --> 00:00:55,451
You are the one that I want.

20
00:00:56,031 --> 00:00:57,224
Yeah, me too.

21
00:02:09,384 --> 00:02:10,199
Excuse me!

22
00:02:12,334 --> 00:02:13,154
Hello?!

23
00:02:19,607 --> 00:02:20,423
Hola?

24
00:02:21,935 --> 00:02:22,564
Hola.

25
00:02:23,664 --> 00:02:24,311
Okay.

26
00:02:24,909 --> 00:02:26,819
Look, I don’t know what my mom told you,

27
00:02:27,294 --> 00:02:31,028
but here’s the drill, pool boys don’t get swimming privileges.

28
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:36,527
Right I… ciento you too.

29
00:02:36,696 --> 00:02:40,786
Um… get aye outay.

30
00:02:52,337 --> 00:02:53,827
What? You lose your suit?

31
00:02:56,706 --> 00:03:00,790
Okay, I ditched Spanish the day they covered the naked verbs.

32
00:03:01,841 --> 00:03:06,059
You no swim here.

33
00:03:06,433 --> 00:03:07,245
Okay?

34
00:03:08,249 --> 00:03:09,710
Okay.

35
00:03:17,403 --> 00:03:21,501
Every night I watch you sleep,

36
00:03:22,044 --> 00:03:25,521
Peace in dreams I hope you’ll keep.

37
00:03:25,771 --> 00:03:28,536
Until your death,

38
00:03:28,837 --> 00:03:31,966
With your last bre- Breat-brea.

39
00:03:33,124 --> 00:03:35,658
Are you writing a song or are you planning on killing me?

40
00:03:36,364 --> 00:03:39,754
Uh, officially I’m writing a new song, unofficially; I’d watch your back.

41
00:03:40,512 --> 00:03:43,656
By the way, I found a new car on the internet.

42
00:03:43,876 --> 00:03:45,739
- It’s great. 
- Define great.

43
00:03:45,934 --> 00:03:49,851
Five-hundred bucks great, which is actually thirty-six bucks less than we’ve got in the wish dish

44
00:03:49,892 --> 00:03:52,181
so we could probably spring for a full tank of gas.

45
00:03:52,246 --> 00:03:56,204
Well you know; my wish was more along the lines of TeeVO… surround sound.

46
00:03:56,267 --> 00:03:59,122
Well a car will get you off the bus before Keith fires you for being late.

47
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:02,000
Will you just take a look at it? If it’s a piece of junk we’ll keep looking.

48
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:03,582
- Deal? 
- Deal.

49
00:04:04,526 --> 00:04:07,346
And um… make sure the trunk’s big enough to fit your body.

50
00:04:09,210 --> 00:04:10,091
Just in case.

51
00:04:16,553 --> 00:04:17,366
Dan?

52
00:04:18,533 --> 00:04:19,290
Are you okay?

53
00:04:20,509 --> 00:04:21,232
Yeah.

54
00:04:22,306 --> 00:04:23,920
I’m gonna order some lawn gnomes.

55
00:04:24,637 --> 00:04:26,244
Front yard looks a little bare.

56
00:04:26,633 --> 00:04:28,691
It’s a nice day. You wanna try a walk?

57
00:04:29,557 --> 00:04:30,482
Maybe later.

58
00:04:39,894 --> 00:04:41,185
- Hey Peyton. 
- Hey.

59
00:04:41,246 --> 00:04:45,219
- You looking for Lucas? 
- Um… actually I was looking for you.

60
00:04:45,787 --> 00:04:50,508
I just wanted to say I’m sorry things didn’t work out between you and my dad.

61
00:04:50,979 --> 00:04:53,314
I was really enjoying getting to know you.

62
00:04:53,775 --> 00:04:54,948
Yeah, I liked that too.

63
00:04:56,012 --> 00:05:00,233
So I was hoping maybe we could keep in touch. Unless that’s weird.

64
00:05:00,682 --> 00:05:02,428
No. That wouldn’t be weird at all.

65
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:04,488
Okay. Great.

66
00:05:05,003 --> 00:05:06,949
Can I ask you for some advice?

67
00:05:07,456 --> 00:05:11,865
You’re just the only woman I know that runs a business and I’ve got this crazy idea.

68
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:14,481
Well I like crazy ideas. What is it?

69
00:05:14,552 --> 00:05:19,579
Okay. It is impossible to see good live music in this town without a fake ID

70
00:05:19,658 --> 00:05:22,883
so I went to THUD and I suggested they sponsor an ‘all-ages’ night.

71
00:05:22,945 --> 00:05:26,482
You know, not like here at the café but… like a club night.

72
00:05:26,671 --> 00:05:30,710
- That sounds great. 
- Yeah, I thought so too but no takers so far.

73
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:34,499
The club managers find out I’m in high school and it kinda ends there.

74
00:05:34,736 --> 00:05:37,013
It only takes one person to say yes Peyton.

75
00:05:37,552 --> 00:05:39,405
If you believe in it, see it through.

76
00:05:39,778 --> 00:05:41,970
Eventually someone else will see it too.

77
00:05:52,538 --> 00:05:56,639
Hey dad! How’s it going? Oh, pretty good son. You know I’m proud of you.

78
00:05:57,546 --> 00:05:58,441
How’s Haley?

79
00:06:01,754 --> 00:06:03,930
Well at least the cardboard one’s polite.

80
00:06:04,309 --> 00:06:06,576
You know, Nathan, you’re not gonna be detailing cars forever.

81
00:06:06,633 --> 00:06:08,993
I’m gonna find you something, you know, better.

82
00:06:09,152 --> 00:06:11,186
No, you know, it’s cool. Whatever I have to do.

83
00:06:11,256 --> 00:06:16,038
I mean just… treat me like any other employee who has no skills and whose last name isn’t Scott.

84
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:18,040
Okay, I will.

85
00:06:19,766 --> 00:06:23,289
Oh yeah, Keith? Uh… I have a favour to ask.

86
00:06:23,370 --> 00:06:26,177
Oh see now you are like any other employee.

87
00:06:26,392 --> 00:06:30,144
Well… me and Haley have been saving up for a used car and…

88
00:06:30,672 --> 00:06:33,826
well she found one she likes but I don’t know anything about cars.

89
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:37,139
So I was wondering if you could, check one out for me tomorrow?

90
00:06:37,328 --> 00:06:42,078
I’d be happy to. Long as you don’t spread that ‘I don’t know anything about cars’ around the dealership.

91
00:06:43,216 --> 00:06:47,306
Look I know this isn’t exactly glamorous… but you’re doing a good job.

92
00:06:47,992 --> 00:06:51,746
I’m glad you’re here. It’s... it’s nice to be around family.

93
00:07:03,328 --> 00:07:04,650
Alright, I’m gonna take off.

94
00:07:05,033 --> 00:07:06,032
Oh Nathan.

95
00:07:07,932 --> 00:07:11,066
Sorry. Force of habit. Lucas.

96
00:07:11,178 --> 00:07:12,089
It’s okay.

97
00:07:12,954 --> 00:07:15,866
Actually that reminds me. I left my history book in the kitchen.

98
00:07:18,187 --> 00:07:20,552
I’m gonna be late for school. First day.

99
00:07:20,747 --> 00:07:21,777
You’re gonna do great.

100
00:07:23,687 --> 00:07:27,690
You sure you’re gonna be okay here? I mean if Dan needs you, I can get Lucas in after school.

101
00:07:27,781 --> 00:07:31,960
Oh no, it’s fine. I don’t think I’m what Dan needs anyway.

102
00:07:32,635 --> 00:07:36,062
- What do you mean? 
- Oh he’s withdrawn, he’s depressed.

103
00:07:36,137 --> 00:07:39,931
Well the doctor did say mood swings were pretty common after a heart attack right?

104
00:07:40,024 --> 00:07:43,321
Oh well, it’s more than that. He just… he sits around watching TV.

105
00:07:43,402 --> 00:07:45,865
He won’t do his rehab. I can’t reach him.

106
00:07:46,419 --> 00:07:49,552
And, without Nathan around,  I don’t know who can.

107
00:07:50,766 --> 00:07:52,860
- I’ll see ya. 
- Okay, bye.

108
00:07:57,801 --> 00:07:58,608
Lucas.

109
00:07:58,783 --> 00:08:00,525
Um… door was open.

110
00:08:01,529 --> 00:08:02,332
Wanna have a seat?

111
00:08:03,095 --> 00:08:05,245
Actually, I was wondering if you wanted to go out.

112
00:08:06,586 --> 00:08:10,064
Um… not thanks. I’m not really up for it today.

113
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:13,212
Listen, you said you wanted to rehab together; here I am.

114
00:08:13,294 --> 00:08:14,420
Well maybe later.

115
00:08:15,556 --> 00:08:18,358
Today only. Take it or leave it.

116
00:08:24,053 --> 00:08:25,603
You think you can make it to the corner?

117
00:08:25,762 --> 00:08:26,566
Of course.

118
00:08:28,194 --> 00:08:29,365
You been shooting around at all?

119
00:08:30,963 --> 00:08:34,409
Some. You know, this isn’t a race. You know, we can slow down if you want.

120
00:08:34,487 --> 00:08:35,695
Easy for you to say.

121
00:08:36,982 --> 00:08:38,429
What is that supposed to mean?

122
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:40,851
Nothing. It’s just…

123
00:08:41,244 --> 00:08:45,115
it’s hard to be less than what you once were. You might not understand that.

124
00:08:45,730 --> 00:08:46,795
Yeah, I do.

125
00:08:47,578 --> 00:08:51,157
You know, I’m not sure I’ll ever play basketball the same level ever again.

126
00:08:52,124 --> 00:08:53,317
Think about it every day.

127
00:08:55,642 --> 00:08:57,987
- Nathan doing okay? 
- You really wanna know?

128
00:08:58,361 --> 00:09:01,668
Yeah, I do. After all that’s happened, he’s still my son.

129
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:06,497
He’s good, you know. He and Haley are happy. He… really likes it at the dealership.

130
00:09:07,363 --> 00:09:08,431
My dealership?

131
00:09:09,529 --> 00:09:13,485
Yeah, uh, Keith took him on. I thought you knew.

132
00:09:15,375 --> 00:09:16,479
We’re done here.

133
00:09:16,605 --> 00:09:18,072
Hey come on. It’s not that far to the corner.

134
00:09:18,146 --> 00:09:20,593
I said I’m done. My health, my call.

135
00:09:21,362 --> 00:09:24,580
Okay. Well let me at least take you back to the house.

136
00:09:24,657 --> 00:09:27,029
Lucas, go to school.

137
00:09:33,008 --> 00:09:36,040
So, Business 101 huh? You a business major?

138
00:09:36,464 --> 00:09:39,291
I’m not sure yet. It’s uh, my first college class.

139
00:09:40,331 --> 00:09:43,239
Are you taking it with Hargrove? This guy’s tough.

140
00:09:43,325 --> 00:09:44,036
Really?

141
00:09:45,583 --> 00:09:46,633
How tough?

142
00:09:47,365 --> 00:09:50,748
I heard he shot a guy, it ‘B’ school, just to watch him die.

143
00:09:52,061 --> 00:09:53,817
- You’re kidding? 
- Yes.

144
00:09:55,737 --> 00:09:58,256
Well about him shooting someone. Not about him being tough though.

145
00:10:02,034 --> 00:10:02,777
Good luck.

146
00:10:10,078 --> 00:10:15,065
Morning folks. My name is Andy Hargrove, welcome to my class.

147
00:10:15,372 --> 00:10:18,470
When I was twenty-one I made my first million with a B2B search engine.

148
00:10:18,813 --> 00:10:21,961
The next year, I tripled it and then I tripled that.

149
00:10:22,077 --> 00:10:25,269
Did an IPO, got really rich, cashed out and wound up here.

150
00:10:26,063 --> 00:10:29,570
Well there’s a couple of hangovers in this side trip to Nepal between there and here

151
00:10:29,714 --> 00:10:31,444
but that’s not important right now.

152
00:10:32,463 --> 00:10:33,230
Okay.

153
00:10:34,982 --> 00:10:36,240
Let’s talk about…

154
00:10:39,585 --> 00:10:42,724
greed. Can’t run a business without it.

155
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,311
Anyone disagree with me?

156
00:10:47,337 --> 00:10:49,138
There’s one in every class. Okay.

157
00:10:49,686 --> 00:10:50,819
So, what’s your name?

158
00:10:51,381 --> 00:10:54,864
Karen, and granted, I run a small café

159
00:10:54,950 --> 00:10:58,165
but I’ve found that if your treat people well, they come back.

160
00:10:58,365 --> 00:11:02,139
If you price things fairly, if you make a… quality product;

161
00:11:02,205 --> 00:11:04,800
you don’t have to be ruthless to be successful.

162
00:11:07,766 --> 00:11:11,652
Does… does anyone agree with her?

163
00:11:15,461 --> 00:11:17,124
Well that’s too bad coz she’s right.

164
00:11:17,201 --> 00:11:21,368
Guy co-look, I know that this class is titled Business 101,

165
00:11:21,733 --> 00:11:23,807
but I like to think of it as Zen Business.

166
00:11:24,805 --> 00:11:26,321
Who here wants to do well?

167
00:11:28,690 --> 00:11:29,645
Everybody.

168
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:33,089
Who here wants to do good?

169
00:11:34,831 --> 00:11:37,252
Coz there’s absolutely no reason why you can’t do both.

170
00:11:37,497 --> 00:11:40,688
And since I’m the teacher, let’s just presume I’m right about that for now, okay?

171
00:11:43,274 --> 00:11:47,261
Alright so everybody flunks today’s lesson, except for Karen.

172
00:12:03,906 --> 00:12:04,827
Are you okay?

173
00:12:05,084 --> 00:12:06,917
Yeah, unless we’re both dead.

174
00:12:08,217 --> 00:12:10,050
Hey buddy! That’s my spot!

175
00:12:12,401 --> 00:12:14,607
What are you doing here? You’re the pool boy.

176
00:12:15,022 --> 00:12:18,503
You no park here.

177
00:12:21,356 --> 00:12:22,456
Do you know this guy?

178
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,968
No. I’ve just seen him naked!

179
00:12:40,709 --> 00:12:42,793
Pool boy! Wait up!

180
00:12:43,131 --> 00:12:45,266
Running and gunning baby. You gotta keep up with me.

181
00:12:45,363 --> 00:12:46,756
You speak English!

182
00:12:46,834 --> 00:12:49,153
Figured we wouldn’t get very far if you kept trying to speak Spanish.

183
00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:50,643
Who the hell are you anyway?

184
00:12:51,748 --> 00:12:56,009
Hey! Buddy these are two hundred dollar shoes don’t make me speed walk!

185
00:12:56,603 --> 00:12:59,583
I’m your new neighbour which makes you, the girl next door.

186
00:12:59,690 --> 00:13:01,329
And in the movie, she was a porn star.

187
00:13:01,543 --> 00:13:05,653
Ha, well I don’t believe you coz if you were my neighbour, you’d know that house has its own pool.

188
00:13:05,711 --> 00:13:06,839
I like yours better.

189
00:13:07,287 --> 00:13:10,012
Look, this thing between us, it’s inevitable.

190
00:13:10,078 --> 00:13:11,927
What thing? There is no thing.

191
00:13:12,010 --> 00:13:13,871
Come on! We fight, we flirt.

192
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:17,026
Maybe even slap me but eventually, we end up in the sack together

193
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:19,279
so how bout we skip the anger and cut right to the sex?

194
00:13:19,341 --> 00:13:20,897
How bout we cut right to the slap?

195
00:13:20,969 --> 00:13:22,703
Okay. It’s part of the sex.

196
00:13:23,308 --> 00:13:25,142
Hey Brooke. Who’s your friend?

197
00:13:25,418 --> 00:13:26,836
He’s no friend of mine.

198
00:13:27,688 --> 00:13:30,027
Girl I love it when you’re sassy!

199
00:13:32,269 --> 00:13:34,706
Oh how you doing man? I’m Felix; the new guy.

200
00:13:34,778 --> 00:13:37,082
I’m Mouth; the been-here-forever guy.

201
00:13:37,511 --> 00:13:39,923
Right, so tell me something man; how’s the talent around here?

202
00:13:40,215 --> 00:13:41,020
Sports?

203
00:13:41,167 --> 00:13:43,046
Keeps up with me Mouth; women. The girls.

204
00:13:43,102 --> 00:13:45,878
How’s the stock? Are they all like your friend Brooke?

205
00:13:46,119 --> 00:13:48,690
Oh um… I don’t really…

206
00:13:48,899 --> 00:13:50,528
Oh you don’t know. That’s okay.

207
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:52,401
I need someone to show me around. You up for that?

208
00:13:52,503 --> 00:13:53,951
Sure, guess so.

209
00:13:54,132 --> 00:13:57,085
Great. Look here’s the thing; we gonna act strong now.

210
00:13:57,199 --> 00:13:59,712
We’re not gonna hurt anyone but we’re gonna break a few hearts, it happens.

211
00:13:59,906 --> 00:14:01,454
They live, you learn.

212
00:14:01,847 --> 00:14:05,216
Occupational hazard. Alright, who do you like that’s available?

213
00:14:05,304 --> 00:14:06,236
Who do I like?

214
00:14:06,768 --> 00:14:09,860
For me Mouth. Okay? Don’t be selfish.

215
00:14:13,553 --> 00:14:14,555
How about her?

216
00:14:18,703 --> 00:14:21,657
Nah, too young. You wanna hit it, not baby-sit it.

217
00:14:21,902 --> 00:14:23,496
Look, onto of that, I’m the new guy.

218
00:14:23,587 --> 00:14:26,942
I mean my game is strong anyway, but new guy status is hardcore.

219
00:14:27,263 --> 00:14:29,285
Peyton, Haley. This is Felix.

220
00:14:29,797 --> 00:14:31,283
- Hi. 
- How you doing?

221
00:14:31,564 --> 00:14:34,664
- Hi, nice to meet you. 
- Girl, you are totally fine.

222
00:14:35,245 --> 00:14:37,027
Dude, I’m totally married.

223
00:14:37,616 --> 00:14:39,459
Really? Who’s the father?

224
00:14:40,304 --> 00:14:41,543
Little close aren’t you?

225
00:14:42,091 --> 00:14:43,167
Oh, guess it’s you.

226
00:14:46,797 --> 00:14:49,049
She’s not pregnant but they are married.

227
00:14:49,208 --> 00:14:52,181
Yeah yeah, I saw the ring. Guess she likes poor guys.

228
00:14:56,055 --> 00:14:57,478
This should be interesting.

229
00:14:58,199 --> 00:14:58,942
Yeah!

230
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:01,706
So I showed him around and he seems pretty cool.

231
00:15:01,916 --> 00:15:04,200
His family, they move like almost every year.

232
00:15:04,405 --> 00:15:05,516
Witness protection?

233
00:15:05,675 --> 00:15:08,722
Uh-uh, doctors without borders. They’ve been all over the world.

234
00:15:08,793 --> 00:15:11,010
His parents are opening up a private practise over here.

235
00:15:11,383 --> 00:15:12,290
Who we talking about?

236
00:15:12,602 --> 00:15:15,439
- Felix, the new guy. 
- You met him?

237
00:15:15,890 --> 00:15:17,785
Sort of, he was hitting on Haley.

238
00:15:19,176 --> 00:15:20,558
I thought you weren’t supposed to be playing.

239
00:15:20,684 --> 00:15:22,981
Hey look, a little pick-up every now and then aint gonna kill me.

240
00:15:23,606 --> 00:15:24,359
Wanna run?

241
00:15:26,176 --> 00:15:27,506
I was on my way home.

242
00:15:27,727 --> 00:15:31,347
Got a tonne of studying to do and I gotta work tomorrow. One shot.

243
00:15:33,009 --> 00:15:33,831
Yes!

244
00:15:34,785 --> 00:15:36,955
How’s work anyway huh? Boss not riding you too hard?

245
00:15:37,290 --> 00:15:38,596
No man, Keith’s cool;

246
00:15:38,903 --> 00:15:40,517
a lot cooler than my dad ever was.

247
00:15:41,510 --> 00:15:45,647
It’s kind of weird how… my closest contact with him now is a cardboard cut-out.

248
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:50,055
Oh yeah, listen, I may have screwed things up… for you, with Dan.

249
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:54,781
He asked about you… and I kinda… mentioned the dealership gig.

250
00:15:55,528 --> 00:15:56,676
But you talked to him?

251
00:15:56,842 --> 00:15:57,669
Yeah.

252
00:15:59,016 --> 00:16:01,315
Look, your mom’s having trouble getting him to rehab.

253
00:16:01,826 --> 00:16:06,050
So I figured maybe I’d… give it a shot. If that’s cool with you.

254
00:16:06,132 --> 00:16:10,419
Honestly; after everything you know about the guy are you sure you wanna let him in?

255
00:16:12,693 --> 00:16:14,386
You know, when Dan had his heart attack,

256
00:16:15,907 --> 00:16:19,065
I figured; well that’s it. You know, we’re never gonna know each other.

257
00:16:20,054 --> 00:16:21,468
But… he didn’t die.

258
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:26,700
So it kinda makes me wonder if I don’t take a chance now,

259
00:16:28,098 --> 00:16:29,557
will I regret it someday?

260
00:16:30,591 --> 00:16:32,199
You do what you need to do man.

261
00:16:33,489 --> 00:16:35,010
You should know who he is.

262
00:16:36,474 --> 00:16:40,166
I want you to fire Nathan. Name over the front door still says ‘Dan Scott Motors’.

263
00:16:41,169 --> 00:16:45,276
As long as I’m running things, I’m gonna make hiring decisions as I see fit.

264
00:16:45,353 --> 00:16:47,841
You know, word is you actually got a heart in your chest Dan;

265
00:16:48,009 --> 00:16:49,407
why don’t you try thinking of Nathan.

266
00:16:49,469 --> 00:16:54,640
You know Keith, if Nathan can support a wife, he’ll never realise what a colossal mistake this marriage is.

267
00:16:54,712 --> 00:16:56,217
He’s emancipated Dan!

268
00:16:57,406 --> 00:17:00,497
That’s his mistake to make and if you want him fired,

269
00:17:00,570 --> 00:17:03,836
then you’re gonna have to look him in the eye and do it yourself when you come back to work.

270
00:17:04,265 --> 00:17:07,321
Until then… he stays.

271
00:17:12,391 --> 00:17:14,828
It’s all attitude Mouth. It’s gotta work with the vibe you got.

272
00:17:15,074 --> 00:17:17,336
Geeky and shy are not a vibe.

273
00:17:17,741 --> 00:17:20,634
Packaging my man; you’re not geeky, you’re sensitive.

274
00:17:20,849 --> 00:17:23,183
You’re not shy, you’re mysterious.

275
00:17:23,997 --> 00:17:25,206
Girls love that.

276
00:17:27,290 --> 00:17:28,975
Anybody special you looking to impress?

277
00:17:33,399 --> 00:17:37,100
Nah, nah, I’m just um… you know, I’m playing the field.

278
00:17:37,776 --> 00:17:38,647
Sup Mouth?

279
00:17:38,791 --> 00:17:39,660
Hey Luke.

280
00:17:41,190 --> 00:17:44,468
- Run anybody over today? 
- I feel you man.

281
00:17:44,649 --> 00:17:47,837
It’s hard when the big dog comes to town. Not sure where you stand anymore.

282
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:51,037
I get that. Hang tough bro. It gets easier.

283
00:17:56,736 --> 00:17:57,688
Still mad?

284
00:17:58,533 --> 00:17:59,506
Still here?

285
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:06,920
So what happened between you and Brooke?

286
00:18:07,022 --> 00:18:08,092
Or was it Peyton?

287
00:18:08,450 --> 00:18:10,212
Tell me it was both at the same time.

288
00:18:11,804 --> 00:18:16,059
Dude, I never said a word. I swear. He’s got like… psychic super powers.

289
00:18:16,172 --> 00:18:19,311
Nah… I just been in eighty schools in the past ten years.

290
00:18:19,387 --> 00:18:20,627
You learn how to read people.

291
00:18:21,275 --> 00:18:23,181
So; Brooke? Peyton?

292
00:18:23,299 --> 00:18:24,855
We’re all just friends.

293
00:18:25,634 --> 00:18:26,817
If that’s your story.

294
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:34,331
Um… see you later.

295
00:18:43,116 --> 00:18:44,331
How much do you love me?

296
00:18:44,424 --> 00:18:45,458
Do we get the car?!

297
00:18:45,643 --> 00:18:46,493
Close you eyes.

298
00:18:46,717 --> 00:18:48,652
- It’s a car in our apartment? 
- Haley, come on.

299
00:18:48,756 --> 00:18:50,798
Come on... alright alright, I’m closing my eyes.

300
00:18:50,865 --> 00:18:53,349
Alright, come here. Wait a second.

301
00:18:54,726 --> 00:18:56,017
Alright. Open!

302
00:18:57,007 --> 00:18:58,172
You love it?

303
00:19:04,279 --> 00:19:05,328
What did you do?

304
00:19:05,422 --> 00:19:06,958
Now you have something to compose on.

305
00:19:07,419 --> 00:19:09,117
But you were going with Keith to look for a car.

306
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:11,360
Yeah we did but Keith said it was no good so…

307
00:19:18,068 --> 00:19:21,504
Nathan… you have to take this back.

308
00:19:27,704 --> 00:19:28,651
You don’t like it.

309
00:19:28,999 --> 00:19:31,395
Of course I like it. It’s beautiful.

310
00:19:32,117 --> 00:19:33,944
But we need a car.

311
00:19:34,078 --> 00:19:35,707
Haley, we can get a car anytime.

312
00:19:35,793 --> 00:19:38,042
With what?! Magic beans?

313
00:19:38,164 --> 00:19:43,032
I mean... Look, I know. I know you’ve never had to deal with money before

314
00:19:43,602 --> 00:19:46,188
but things are different now. You can’t just go out and...

315
00:19:46,284 --> 00:19:50,150
and buy a… keyboard because you feel like it! We agreed on a car!

316
00:19:50,201 --> 00:19:52,746
Haley! You are a really good musician! Okay?

317
00:19:52,818 --> 00:19:55,259
I have a feeling about your music. It’s gonna take you places.

318
00:19:55,675 --> 00:20:00,983
It means a lot to me Nathan. It does but what is gonna take you to work?

319
00:20:01,604 --> 00:20:04,937
Alright, you know what; I was just trying to do something nice for you. Okay?

320
00:20:05,013 --> 00:20:09,663
Fine. You wanna do something nice for me? Get us a car like we talked about.

321
00:20:14,931 --> 00:20:19,463
It’s a beautiful gift but… we worked so hard to save that money.

322
00:20:19,678 --> 00:20:23,974
Hales, boys are clueless. I swear to you, I’m thirty years away from giving them up for good.

323
00:20:24,035 --> 00:20:28,422
Okay, so, what about this? Does this say… ‘let me promote and all-ages club night’?

324
00:20:28,873 --> 00:20:32,831
No. Not enough skin. Try… this.

325
00:20:39,042 --> 00:20:42,165
Oh god. That much for two doilies and a piece of wire?

326
00:20:43,802 --> 00:20:45,043
You’re not gonna try it on?

327
00:20:45,770 --> 00:20:46,804
Not today.

328
00:20:47,254 --> 00:20:51,454
Not today? Brooke Davis, this is a shopping day you will never ever get back again.

329
00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:55,497
Hey listen, if you’re still waiting on your ATM card, I can front you the cash.

330
00:20:55,646 --> 00:20:56,711
Nah, it’s cool.

331
00:20:57,034 --> 00:20:59,963
My dad just… spaced a deposit to my account.

332
00:21:00,033 --> 00:21:01,191
Okay!

333
00:21:04,356 --> 00:21:08,707
Ah, now we’re talking. If this band manager is a guy, you are golden!

334
00:21:09,107 --> 00:21:12,460
You know, speaking of guys, can we just do five minutes on this Felix person?

335
00:21:12,558 --> 00:21:17,227
Yes! He is hot and totally vibing on you married girl.

336
00:21:17,315 --> 00:21:19,326
No wonder Nathan’s jealous.

337
00:21:19,538 --> 00:21:22,823
It’s kinda weird, I’ve never had anything like that happen before.

338
00:21:22,886 --> 00:21:27,273
Okay, but guys, how can he make Nathan jealous? This boy is repellent!

339
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:30,877
I mean he’s been here what, five seconds and he’s already butting in everybody else’s business,

340
00:21:30,959 --> 00:21:34,062
bossing people around and acting like he owns the place, come on!

341
00:21:35,965 --> 00:21:36,780
What!?

342
00:21:37,138 --> 00:21:40,518
Earth to Brooke, he’s you… in pants.

343
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:41,962
He in not!

344
00:21:43,150 --> 00:21:43,898
Kinda is.

345
00:21:44,106 --> 00:21:46,381
Argh! Argh I hate you both!

346
00:21:54,637 --> 00:21:56,114
Any verdict on college yet?

347
00:21:57,272 --> 00:22:01,296
Well my teacher’s a little unorthodox. And younger than I expected.

348
00:22:01,544 --> 00:22:05,182
Ahh, so you’re one of these ah, maturity… likers.

349
00:22:06,994 --> 00:22:08,627
Sorry, I suck at grammar.

350
00:22:10,234 --> 00:22:12,876
So, why did you pick me out of the class?

351
00:22:13,410 --> 00:22:16,006
I mean you always find somebody to torment?

352
00:22:16,327 --> 00:22:18,837
I like to find the student who can give me a run for my money.

353
00:22:18,965 --> 00:22:22,472
Ah, which is a lot of money of my google search is correct.

354
00:22:23,102 --> 00:22:24,412
Yeah, it is.

355
00:22:24,792 --> 00:22:28,134
What kind of guy cashes in on a fifty million dollar business?

356
00:22:28,427 --> 00:22:29,807
A guy who wasn’t happy.

357
00:22:31,474 --> 00:22:35,870
Oh no look I mean I started with a small business you know? Like your café and…

358
00:22:36,710 --> 00:22:39,506
I got bored, I took some risks, business picked up

359
00:22:39,762 --> 00:22:43,792
and when I hit fifty million, obviously I realised I could just… coast on that forever.

360
00:22:44,965 --> 00:22:47,708
What’s the point you know? No getting challenged.

361
00:22:47,790 --> 00:22:49,234
And teaching is that challenge for you?

362
00:22:49,311 --> 00:22:51,042
Yeah. Yeah, scares me to death.

363
00:22:51,304 --> 00:22:55,316
I just know that one of those weasels in the front row is gonna ask me a question that I can’t answer.

364
00:22:57,164 --> 00:22:59,285
So what about you? You ever thought about growing your business?

365
00:22:59,439 --> 00:23:00,473
Oh sure.

366
00:23:01,044 --> 00:23:04,502
I even drew up expansion plans but it was never the right time.

367
00:23:04,707 --> 00:23:08,106
Never is you know. Just gotta figure it out ask you go along.

368
00:23:08,353 --> 00:23:11,414
But if you ask me, the object of the game is to make a difference.

369
00:23:14,381 --> 00:23:18,736
Okay, all I’m saying is that a lotta kids would support live music if they had a night of their own.

370
00:23:18,797 --> 00:23:22,613
Now you manage more than one band. Okay, so if you would just work with me on this,

371
00:23:22,659 --> 00:23:24,710
I know we could get a club owner to agree to try it out.

372
00:23:24,788 --> 00:23:27,144
Look. My band doesn’t play to kids.

373
00:23:27,215 --> 00:23:29,329
We play to shot and beer crowds, not high school proms.

374
00:23:29,406 --> 00:23:33,789
Okay but what I’m saying is that an all-ages club could work in this town.

375
00:23:34,076 --> 00:23:36,195
Sorry, no dice. I’m just not interested.

376
00:23:36,268 --> 00:23:39,896
Swear to god, this is the last time I hire a singer off a flier at Kinko’s.

377
00:23:40,076 --> 00:23:43,553
You know nothing, absolutely nothing about music man.

378
00:23:43,666 --> 00:23:47,552
I went to Berkley ass-face; studied a little something called composition.

379
00:23:47,618 --> 00:23:48,739
You might want to look into it.

380
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:51,423
Yeah I will, the next time I look in the audience and they’re ignoring us.

381
00:23:51,529 --> 00:23:52,773
Plant and Page.

382
00:23:53,619 --> 00:23:54,596
Have we met?

383
00:23:54,961 --> 00:23:55,729
Who’s this?

384
00:23:55,825 --> 00:23:59,127
I was in the crowd the night that you guys played together the first time.

385
00:24:00,976 --> 00:24:01,724
Go on.

386
00:24:02,235 --> 00:24:04,734
There were what, like twenty people in the crown that night?

387
00:24:04,795 --> 00:24:07,515
But your energy was… I mean it was so real!

388
00:24:07,596 --> 00:24:10,125
You know, you guys looked like you were gonna explode up there on stage

389
00:24:10,208 --> 00:24:11,698
but that’s what made it work.

390
00:24:12,015 --> 00:24:16,879
That’s the tension that made Led Zeplin work and it’s the same tension that sets your music apart.

391
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:19,501
The Key Club.

392
00:24:20,407 --> 00:24:21,441
That was a good night.

393
00:24:21,528 --> 00:24:24,860
Well… yeah, they could all be good nights if you guys would just quit your bitching

394
00:24:24,938 --> 00:24:26,598
and… focus on what matters.

395
00:24:27,166 --> 00:24:29,552
But then again, what do I know you know I’m just a kid.

396
00:24:29,986 --> 00:24:32,967
But if I were you guys I’d put my energy into the music otherwise…

397
00:24:33,095 --> 00:24:35,317
you’ll be lucky to play at the high school prom.

398
00:24:48,353 --> 00:24:49,842
Hey, thanks for coming back.

399
00:24:50,032 --> 00:24:53,069
Sorry about the crappy mood the other day. Shouldn’t have taken it out on you.

400
00:24:53,205 --> 00:24:56,277
It’s cool but if it starts to become a habit; find yourself another trainer.

401
00:24:56,903 --> 00:24:57,789
New car?

402
00:24:57,953 --> 00:24:58,874
Dealership.

403
00:24:59,611 --> 00:25:02,433
I like to drive all the new models so I can tell the customers what they’re getting.

404
00:25:03,114 --> 00:25:05,336
Problem is, the doctors won’t let me drive yet.

405
00:25:06,831 --> 00:25:07,559
You mind?

406
00:25:09,059 --> 00:25:09,806
Mind what?

407
00:25:10,170 --> 00:25:13,180
Taking it for a spin. Tell me how she handles.

408
00:25:13,268 --> 00:25:14,669
Any kind of feedback would help.

409
00:25:15,382 --> 00:25:17,691
We can stop somewhere along the way and do some rehab.

410
00:25:17,941 --> 00:25:18,874
You game?

411
00:25:21,813 --> 00:25:25,540
Lucas, I can barely take a walk without gasping for air right now.

412
00:25:25,759 --> 00:25:27,071
At least I have my work.

413
00:25:28,274 --> 00:25:29,625
You’d really be helping me out.

414
00:25:37,806 --> 00:25:41,314
The job doesn’t end getting the band you know? You gotta take care of them.

415
00:25:41,483 --> 00:25:46,184
You gotta be part cheerleader, part babysitter, part therapist.

416
00:25:47,306 --> 00:25:49,414
It’s no problem, I can handle that.

417
00:25:49,502 --> 00:25:54,893
What I’m saying is… you gotta look after all their needs; food, drink, drugs.

418
00:25:55,595 --> 00:25:56,875
Um, drugs?

419
00:25:57,054 --> 00:26:00,565
Oh don’t worry, I’ll set you up with the guys I buy from.

420
00:26:00,796 --> 00:26:01,943
They’re reliable.

421
00:26:02,594 --> 00:26:05,420
I mean, they’re drug dealers, you don’t wanna mouse it or anything…

422
00:26:05,735 --> 00:26:09,009
but… they won’t burn you.

423
00:26:10,009 --> 00:26:11,758
I got a good sense about people.

424
00:26:12,006 --> 00:26:18,066
You’re young but you… might be worth the risk.

425
00:26:20,428 --> 00:26:21,610
No thanks.

426
00:26:24,905 --> 00:26:26,509
Here’s your shot kid.

427
00:26:30,608 --> 00:26:31,798
What do you say?

428
00:26:41,196 --> 00:26:42,044
Brooke?

429
00:26:43,801 --> 00:26:44,706
What’s wrong?

430
00:26:46,767 --> 00:26:48,746
I just keep screwing up this toe.

431
00:26:51,096 --> 00:26:51,807
Brooke.

432
00:26:53,795 --> 00:26:58,612
You know how I told you that my credit card got declined because the bill got paid late?

433
00:27:01,209 --> 00:27:02,550
It’s a load of crap.

434
00:27:03,229 --> 00:27:04,475
Well what happened?

435
00:27:05,386 --> 00:27:06,256
We're broke.

436
00:27:08,433 --> 00:27:11,063
My dad’s company went under and…

437
00:27:11,233 --> 00:27:15,693
doing this stupid bankruptcy thing and my mum’s telling me we might have to sell the house.

438
00:27:16,644 --> 00:27:19,107
God Brooke. I’m so sorry.

439
00:27:19,809 --> 00:27:21,022
Yeah me too.

440
00:27:21,862 --> 00:27:24,253
I love being rich, I’m good at it.

441
00:27:26,650 --> 00:27:32,082
So is that why Felix is getting under your skin? Coz he’s… the rich guy next door.

442
00:27:32,896 --> 00:27:34,247
I dunno, maybe.

443
00:27:35,477 --> 00:27:40,592
Brooke, its just money. You know. There is so much more to you than that.

444
00:27:40,664 --> 00:27:42,563
Yeah but that’s my favourite part.

445
00:27:43,628 --> 00:27:45,974
I don’t wanna talk about it anymore. How was your meeting?

446
00:27:48,707 --> 00:27:50,131
It’s not gonna work out.

447
00:27:50,875 --> 00:27:51,633
Really?

448
00:27:53,821 --> 00:27:54,800
I’m sorry.

449
00:27:55,057 --> 00:27:57,892
Yeah… me too.

450
00:27:59,116 --> 00:28:02,729
Guns and Roses, Whitesnake, Metallica, Aerosmith.

451
00:28:04,472 --> 00:28:07,569
Please tell me you’re kidding. You didn’t actually listen to metal?

452
00:28:08,921 --> 00:28:11,020
Even had my own spandex.

453
00:28:12,422 --> 00:28:15,100
Man that is not a vision I wanted to have in my head.

454
00:28:16,765 --> 00:28:18,029
Lucas right?

455
00:28:18,654 --> 00:28:19,406
Yeah.

456
00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:21,178
Nice wheels.

457
00:28:21,786 --> 00:28:24,357
Thanks. You know you’re on the wrong side of the road, right?

458
00:28:24,486 --> 00:28:27,016
Yeah I know. Wanna air it out?

459
00:28:29,487 --> 00:28:30,935
Maybe some other time!

460
00:28:31,188 --> 00:28:34,608
Come on. Race your for that girlfriend. What’s her name? Brooke?

461
00:28:35,607 --> 00:28:36,544
Ex girlfriend.

462
00:28:36,631 --> 00:28:38,704
Which was inevitable once I got to town.

463
00:28:39,099 --> 00:28:41,459
Don’t hate the player; hate the game.

464
00:28:42,602 --> 00:28:46,318
Hey, tell me you’re gonna wipe the smirk off that punks face.

465
00:28:46,635 --> 00:28:48,371
Come on, my T-Bird coulda taken him.

466
00:29:12,081 --> 00:29:14,222
Go go go go go go! Woah!

467
00:30:03,427 --> 00:30:04,772
What the hell are you doing?!

468
00:30:05,206 --> 00:30:06,468
Come on chicken!

469
00:30:30,523 --> 00:30:31,626
You did the right thing.

470
00:30:32,150 --> 00:30:32,882
Yeah.

471
00:30:35,965 --> 00:30:38,457
Don’t sweat it. Chicken’s not for everyone.

472
00:30:40,261 --> 00:30:41,708
Who you got riding shotgun?

473
00:30:42,118 --> 00:30:46,430
Uh… this is… Uh, this is my...

474
00:30:46,542 --> 00:30:48,310
Dan Scott. Scott Motors.

475
00:30:48,555 --> 00:30:51,186
When you’re ready to trade up, come on down to the dealership.

476
00:30:59,746 --> 00:31:01,293
We probably should get going.

477
00:31:06,444 --> 00:31:07,043
Hey.

478
00:31:07,105 --> 00:31:10,048
Hi, the printer dropped off the proofs for the new menu,

479
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:12,490
I wasn’t sure if you were coming by the café today so…

480
00:31:12,562 --> 00:31:14,068
- These are great. 
- Yeah.

481
00:31:15,460 --> 00:31:16,330
What’s this?

482
00:31:17,135 --> 00:31:20,242
Café expansion plans from million years ago.

483
00:31:20,544 --> 00:31:21,543
I was gonna add a bar.

484
00:31:21,922 --> 00:31:23,187
Why didn’t you go through with it?

485
00:31:23,401 --> 00:31:25,634
Ah, you know, the timing was never right.

486
00:31:25,737 --> 00:31:29,827
I was… busy all day at the café and I didn’t wanna give up my nights with Lucas too.

487
00:31:30,667 --> 00:31:32,387
Are you reconsidering?

488
00:31:32,950 --> 00:31:36,729
I’m writing a business plan for class. A start-up for a new venture.

489
00:31:36,939 --> 00:31:38,934
The more I play around with these fake companies,

490
00:31:39,007 --> 00:31:42,556
the more I’m thinking… maybe it shouldn’t be just an exercise.

491
00:31:42,797 --> 00:31:45,151
I'd always hoped to branch out some day.

492
00:31:46,555 --> 00:31:49,289
- Is that nuts? 
- No, not at all.

493
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:51,459
In fact, I’ll be one of your investors.

494
00:31:51,556 --> 00:31:53,651
You don’t even know what I’m proposing.

495
00:31:53,749 --> 00:31:56,718
But I know you and I know how hard you’ll work.

496
00:31:57,127 --> 00:31:59,427
Ah besides, what’s life without a few risks.

497
00:32:22,589 --> 00:32:23,624
Excuse me!

498
00:32:26,331 --> 00:32:27,848
I need to check your bag.

499
00:32:28,754 --> 00:32:29,640
Okay.

500
00:32:30,552 --> 00:32:31,258
Sure.

501
00:32:37,250 --> 00:32:40,520
- What’s this? 
- It’s a birthday present, for me.

502
00:32:41,007 --> 00:32:45,159
She’s shy about buying stuff like this. But hey, I guess that’s part of the turn-on right?

503
00:32:45,461 --> 00:32:47,346
I would have come in to check it out sweetie.

504
00:32:48,036 --> 00:32:51,062
I was just… gonna take it outside to show him.

505
00:32:51,528 --> 00:32:54,144
Blue’s perfect, that’s your colour. We’ll take it.

506
00:33:07,333 --> 00:33:10,141
I gotta admit… it’s a great car.

507
00:33:12,019 --> 00:33:13,381
You want it?

508
00:33:22,090 --> 00:33:23,288
You can’t buy me.

509
00:33:25,551 --> 00:33:27,174
Come on Lucas, it’s not like that.

510
00:33:29,055 --> 00:33:31,192
This is what I do for people I care about.

511
00:33:31,682 --> 00:33:34,921
What, you care about me now?! You don’t even know me!

512
00:33:34,998 --> 00:33:36,814
I want to. More than you know.

513
00:33:37,117 --> 00:33:38,674
We both know I owe it to you.

514
00:33:40,581 --> 00:33:43,357
You almost had me, you know that?

515
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:45,933
Shame on me, right?

516
00:33:46,759 --> 00:33:52,974
I mean I actually enjoyed the day with you. Till now.

517
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:07,986
Some town you’ve got here.

518
00:34:10,169 --> 00:34:12,776
I mean, all the relationships are inbred.

519
00:34:12,895 --> 00:34:15,241
One of the hottest girls get married, if that’s even legal

520
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:17,954
and the rich girl shoplifts for kicks.

521
00:34:20,054 --> 00:34:21,575
What were you doing in there?

522
00:34:21,692 --> 00:34:23,156
I needed the new catalogue.

523
00:34:23,490 --> 00:34:26,290
Besides, you meet the trashiest girls in lingerie shops.

524
00:34:26,464 --> 00:34:27,452
Look, I don’t…

525
00:34:28,322 --> 00:34:30,986
I mean I’ve never done anything like that before.

526
00:34:31,303 --> 00:34:33,305
Well clearly. You suck at it.

527
00:34:33,688 --> 00:34:35,419
- Have fun? 
- No!

528
00:34:36,090 --> 00:34:37,073
It’s just...

529
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:42,121
It was a mistake and I’d like it to stay between us.

530
00:34:42,193 --> 00:34:43,474
I can keep a secret.

531
00:34:44,758 --> 00:34:45,697
Promise?

532
00:34:46,770 --> 00:34:48,168
You’ll just have to trust me.

533
00:34:49,105 --> 00:34:51,180
I don’t know you well enough to trust you.

534
00:34:51,467 --> 00:34:52,474
You will.

535
00:34:53,882 --> 00:34:56,851
You might as well have it. I’m planning on seeing you in it soon.

536
00:34:58,126 --> 00:34:59,826
Not a chance in hell!

537
00:35:03,887 --> 00:35:05,361
You’re welcome, Winona.

538
00:35:16,548 --> 00:35:18,561
You weren’t even gonna come inside and say hello?

539
00:35:19,327 --> 00:35:21,915
I’m working. We got a call to pick up the car.

540
00:35:22,022 --> 00:35:23,175
Oh sure, you’re working.

541
00:35:23,671 --> 00:35:27,141
You’re emancipated now right? Course your old man still sets the table.

542
00:35:27,234 --> 00:35:28,381
I gotta get back.

543
00:35:29,231 --> 00:35:32,062
Hey, I had a heart attack. I coulda died.

544
00:35:32,143 --> 00:35:34,607
Dad, we both know that’s never gonna happen.

545
00:35:34,683 --> 00:35:36,763
You can’t jerk anybody’s chains if you die.

546
00:35:38,371 --> 00:35:39,759
Okay, just wait.

547
00:35:41,171 --> 00:35:43,152
- Let’s just talk. 
- About what?

548
00:35:44,054 --> 00:35:46,511
I dunno. How’s your wife?

549
00:35:52,483 --> 00:35:54,308
Lot happier than yours.

550
00:36:12,324 --> 00:36:14,973
Hey Nate, come here, I wanna show you a couple of the basics.

551
00:36:18,486 --> 00:36:20,698
Alright, you see this battery clamp?

552
00:36:21,030 --> 00:36:24,963
Well, if it gets corroded, then the current can’t get through to the starter

553
00:36:25,030 --> 00:36:27,241
and then you get that ah, that noise when you crank it.

554
00:36:27,323 --> 00:36:29,504
Yeah, the noise.

555
00:36:29,647 --> 00:36:31,521
And everybody thinks it’s a big deal but it’s not.

556
00:36:31,629 --> 00:36:36,017
You just, uh, you just clean it, with a wire brush and… you’re good to go.

557
00:36:36,897 --> 00:36:40,472
That’s so cool! My dad never taught me this stuff. He didn’t want me to be...

558
00:36:42,074 --> 00:36:44,983
He didn’t want you to get grease under your fingernails like me.

559
00:36:46,882 --> 00:36:49,135
Look, that’s my dad, Keith. That’s not me.

560
00:36:49,529 --> 00:36:51,444
So how did it go at the house?

561
00:36:51,653 --> 00:36:54,311
Uh… pretty much what you’d expect.

562
00:36:54,598 --> 00:36:57,356
As a matter of fact, I think I had so much fun, I’m gonna go back tonight

563
00:36:57,597 --> 00:36:59,410
and I’m gonna disappoint Haley some more.

564
00:36:59,491 --> 00:37:00,521
Haley didn’t like the keyboard?

565
00:37:00,614 --> 00:37:03,297
Oh no, she liked it, she just wanted it to have four wheels and a trunk.

566
00:37:09,349 --> 00:37:12,123
I think I might be able to save your marriage.

567
00:37:13,874 --> 00:37:15,201
What do you think of this?

568
00:37:17,305 --> 00:37:20,332
I think it was probably a pretty sweet ride back when dinosaurs ruled the Earth.

569
00:37:21,085 --> 00:37:24,933
Yeah, I was gonna sell it for parts but, you know, we could work on it together.

570
00:37:24,996 --> 00:37:27,105
Fix it up and… then you can have it.

571
00:37:27,596 --> 00:37:29,383
So it’s like a family project?

572
00:37:29,547 --> 00:37:30,679
Yeah, you bet.

573
00:37:36,849 --> 00:37:38,056
We’ll fix that.

574
00:37:53,466 --> 00:37:57,016
If I’da known you couldn’t play any better than that, I wouldn’t have bought it home.

575
00:38:00,636 --> 00:38:03,411
I wanna apologise. Alright?

576
00:38:03,667 --> 00:38:08,658
- That was your money too. 
- Oh it’s not that Nathan. I totally overreacted.

577
00:38:09,176 --> 00:38:12,156
Partly because I love this gift

578
00:38:12,598 --> 00:38:14,921
and I love you for getting it for me.

579
00:38:15,325 --> 00:38:18,812
But partly because we just can’t be as careless as we used to be.

580
00:38:18,858 --> 00:38:20,753
Not if we wanna make this marriage work.

581
00:38:20,824 --> 00:38:24,434
I know, you’re right and… I don’t know the first thing about managing money,

582
00:38:24,762 --> 00:38:26,185
it was just always around.

583
00:38:26,513 --> 00:38:29,785
Yeah well… at least you don’t have that problem anymore.

584
00:38:35,601 --> 00:38:39,150
Hales. I want you to keep this keyboard. Okay?

585
00:38:39,237 --> 00:38:41,495
You have a talent, you need to use it.

586
00:38:41,628 --> 00:38:43,420
- Nathan I...
- We’re keeping it.

587
00:38:47,865 --> 00:38:52,299
Besides, there’s an old car that Keith said I could fix up.

588
00:38:52,805 --> 00:38:54,111
He’s gonna help you?!

589
00:38:54,429 --> 00:38:55,109
Yeah.

590
00:38:57,510 --> 00:39:02,155
Oh! I really wanted to keep it! Thank you.

591
00:39:09,210 --> 00:39:10,551
He didn’t wanna see me.

592
00:39:12,569 --> 00:39:14,325
He didn’t wanna see either of us.

593
00:39:18,473 --> 00:39:20,192
Remember when he was little?

594
00:39:20,715 --> 00:39:23,045
I used to take him to work with me on Saturdays.

595
00:39:23,781 --> 00:39:25,936
He’d have to get up early but he didn’t mind.

596
00:39:26,807 --> 00:39:28,702
He wanted to hang out with his dad.

597
00:39:32,496 --> 00:39:34,476
Now I’m thinking it was all a lie.

598
00:39:36,470 --> 00:39:38,983
What if I spent my life chasing the wrong things Deb?

599
00:39:40,167 --> 00:39:43,249
Success, money, respect.

600
00:39:46,223 --> 00:39:49,874
What if it turns out none of it matters because I lost my family along the way?

601
00:39:54,590 --> 00:39:55,798
Can I get it back?

602
00:39:57,439 --> 00:39:58,547
Is it too late?

603
00:40:00,201 --> 00:40:01,256
I don’t know!

604
00:40:59,005 --> 00:41:00,444
Hey Karen, what’s up?

605
00:41:04,662 --> 00:41:08,789
You know it was such a good… space for Nathan and Haley’s party?

606
00:41:09,454 --> 00:41:11,631
And I think, it would make a great club.

607
00:41:13,442 --> 00:41:19,132
The only thing is, I’m gonna need someone who can run… my all-ages night.

608
00:41:20,902 --> 00:41:24,902
You had a great idea Peyton and I know you’d be worth the risk.

609
00:41:26,980 --> 00:41:27,877
What do you think?

610
00:42:08,443 --> 00:42:10,142
I’ll give you a thousand dollars…

611
00:42:10,374 --> 00:42:11,791
for a decent cup of coffee.

612
00:42:31,705 --> 00:42:32,883
You’re right.

613
00:42:39,157 --> 00:42:40,775
My pool is better.
