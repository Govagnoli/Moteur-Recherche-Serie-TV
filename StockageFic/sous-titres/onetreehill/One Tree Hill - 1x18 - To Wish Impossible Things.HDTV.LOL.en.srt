I’m sorry. Auction rules say cash only. Okay?

10
00:00:50,830 --> 00:00:57,487
Here’s the thing. I’m kind of coming out of a dark place right now and I could really use the distraction.

11
00:00:57,630 --> 00:01:00,660
I need this boy and I need him tonight.

12
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:06,810

00:01:24,261 --> 00:01:30,087
Well, there are four boys still up for auction, and a cash machine right down the street.

21
00:01:32,914 --> 00:01:33,810
Okay.

22
00:01:36,738 --> 00:01:37,804

I want to thank you all for coming this evening supporting this good cause.

00:06:52,375 --> 00:06:58,385
Now  all these young men belong to the highest bidders till that midnight kiss.

00:06:58,696 --> 00:07:01,720
Let’s try to keep things legal this year.

00:07:01,827 --> 00:07:03,880
I’ll give $5 for the microphone boy.

103
00:07:04,768 --> 00:07:07,484

All sales are final.

108
00:07:24,923 --> 00:07:26,669
I didn’t see you in detention.

109
00:07:26,993 --> 00:07:28,338
Can I get you something to eat?

110
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:30,698
Actually  I was wondering if I could get you something to eat.

111
00:07:31,273 --> 00:07:32,880
Unless you’ve got plans after work.

112
00:07:33,686 --> 00:07:34,595
No.

113
00:07:34,709 --> 00:07:36,305
Great. We could go to my place.

114
00:07:39,203 --> 00:07:41,886
Karen. I’m not a serial killer.

115
00:07:42,485 --> 00:07:45,409
It’s just a couple of new friends eating food.

116
00:07:47,171 --> 00:07:48,221
Sure. Okay.

117
00:07:48,623 --> 00:07:50,851
Good, then it’s a date.

118
00:07:54,123 --> 00:07:57,768
Okay, I’ve got $50 cash on the Mouth-Boy for trade. Who wants him?

119
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:03,098
Well, Timmy. Looks like you’re all mine tonight.

120
00:08:03,738 --> 00:08:07,143
How about you grab a change of clothes and I’ll meet you at the house.

121
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:09,027
Change of clothes?

122
00:08:09,154 --> 00:08:12,407
Well you’ll probably want to take a shower after I get through with you.

123
00:08:12,499 --> 00:08:14,983
I plan on getting dirty.

124
00:08:15,851 --> 00:08:19,312
So I’ll leave the door unlocked. Just come in and get me.

125
00:08:29,733 --> 00:08:31,173
Well, well, Jake.

126
00:08:32,856 --> 00:08:36,424
Once again, looks like I own you.

127
00:08:38,125 --> 00:08:39,772
Come on, Jake, wait up.

128
00:08:39,813 --> 00:08:41,601
I’m not kidding, Nikki. I’m not falling for your crap.

129
00:08:41,667 --> 00:08:43,117
At least talk to me?

130
00:08:44,581 --> 00:08:48,150
About what? Where you’ve been for the last 8 months or how my daughter doesn’t have a mother?

131
00:08:48,206 --> 00:08:51,866
I understand you’re upset, but there are things you don’t know. Please.

132
00:08:51,912 --> 00:08:55,118
Jake, come on. I don’t want to mess with your head.

133
00:08:55,538 --> 00:08:57,729
But, the least you could do is hear me out.

134
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,576
After that you can ditch me if you want.

135
00:09:02,532 --> 00:09:03,765
What, like you did me?

136
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:08,498
This things is awesome. Where are we going first?

137
00:09:09,198 --> 00:09:11,806
- Here’s the thing, Lips.
- Mouth.

138
00:09:11,877 --> 00:09:16,699
I know. And I know I owe you for the whole cheerleading competition,

139
00:09:16,765 --> 00:09:21,158
but I had this whole night kind of perfectly planned out and

140
00:09:22,085 --> 00:09:24,221
it’s a waste of a Brazilian wax.

141
00:09:25,623 --> 00:09:28,444
Okay. That’s cool. I can take off.

142
00:09:30,457 --> 00:09:32,175
At least let me give you some of your money back.

143
00:09:32,249 --> 00:09:34,461
Oh, no, no, no. I don’t want that. Please.

144
00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:38,480
No, no I understand. I just thought the car was cool.

145
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:42,300
Um, I’ll see you later.

146
00:09:44,330 --> 00:09:47,140
Wait. Fine!

147
00:09:47,799 --> 00:09:49,319
I’ll take you to once place.

148
00:09:49,442 --> 00:09:50,201
Really?

149
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:53,143
What the hell. It’s for charity, right?

150
00:09:53,901 --> 00:09:56,682
With the night I have planned I might need you to carry me home anyway.

151
00:09:56,748 --> 00:09:57,506
Sweet.

152
00:10:06,612 --> 00:10:10,092
I am so excited to have Lucas all to myself for an evening.

153
00:10:10,151 --> 00:10:12,399
We have not had a night to just hang out in forever.

154
00:10:12,618 --> 00:10:14,258
Yeah, same goes for me and Nathan.

155
00:10:15,253 --> 00:10:18,068
I know you’re still into me, but $112?

156
00:10:19,778 --> 00:10:20,774
- Hey you.
- Hey.

157
00:10:20,817 --> 00:10:23,075
- How about you come see me around midnight? 
- Sounds good.

158
00:10:25,078 --> 00:10:25,922
Don’t have fun.

159
00:10:27,065 --> 00:10:28,053
I wont.

160
00:10:30,264 --> 00:10:32,532
Alright, come on. Let’s get this over with.

161
00:10:33,244 --> 00:10:35,338
Funny. That’s what he’d say before we used to have sex.

162
00:10:49,531 --> 00:10:51,363
So you’re planning to kill me?

163
00:10:52,019 --> 00:10:53,431
The painters must have left it.

164
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:56,058
So what do you think of the new place?

165
00:10:56,363 --> 00:10:57,732
You really moved out, huh?

166
00:10:57,958 --> 00:11:00,585
Yeah. Judge declared me emancipated.

167
00:11:01,542 --> 00:11:02,704
Good for you, Nate.

168
00:11:03,682 --> 00:11:04,834
Come on. Check it out.

169
00:11:08,833 --> 00:11:11,746
So what, you got your big cool apartment but you don’t believe in furniture?

170
00:11:12,203 --> 00:11:13,078
Where are we supposed to eat?

171
00:11:13,631 --> 00:11:14,439
We got the bed.

172
00:11:26,446 --> 00:11:29,099
Still doing that whole desert before the meal thing, huh?

173
00:11:29,719 --> 00:11:31,433
You used to think it was cute.

174
00:11:35,159 --> 00:11:38,074
Yeah. That was before you abandoned my child.

175
00:11:40,747 --> 00:11:43,476
Okay. I guess we’ll do this now.

176
00:11:46,755 --> 00:11:50,900
I made a mistake. I didn’t know what kind of mother I’d be.

177
00:11:50,957 --> 00:11:55,626
All my friends were going off to college, my parents… well you know how they felt.

178
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:59,896
I just wasn’t ready, Jake. Is it that hard to understand?

179
00:12:00,141 --> 00:12:02,245
Yeah, Nikki, it is.

180
00:12:03,193 --> 00:12:06,343
She was a part of you. You held her in your arms.

181
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:10,633
I spent every night asking myself how you could just leave her behind.

182
00:12:10,807 --> 00:12:14,903
I couldn’t. I hated myself for leaving, that’s why I came back.

183
00:12:17,003 --> 00:12:19,168
I want to be in her life, Jake.

184
00:12:20,274 --> 00:12:21,604
And yours too.

185
00:12:32,406 --> 00:12:34,052
I missed you, you know?

186
00:12:35,608 --> 00:12:38,430
I wanted to call you a thousand times over the last 8 months.

187
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:41,721
Yeah but you didn’t. Did you?

188
00:12:47,627 --> 00:12:50,478
Well, that was a great dinner, Larry.

189
00:12:50,595 --> 00:12:52,904
Thanks. Single parent cooking class.

190
00:12:55,808 --> 00:12:57,389
I’m glad you decided to come.

191
00:12:58,116 --> 00:13:00,200
- Not too painful?
- No, not at all.

192
00:13:00,850 --> 00:13:02,054
But you don’t date much?

193
00:13:03,732 --> 00:13:05,633
I don’t date at all, really.

194
00:13:06,605 --> 00:13:10,194
At night I work or I’m at home with Lucas.

195
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:13,102
Sometimes with Keith.

196
00:13:15,627 --> 00:13:17,133
Keith seems like a good man.

197
00:13:17,767 --> 00:13:18,525
He is.

198
00:13:21,099 --> 00:13:22,698
He’s a good friend.

199
00:13:29,078 --> 00:13:32,165
- Well… 
- Oh no. Absolutely not.

200
00:13:32,354 --> 00:13:35,836
You’re  off duty and not allowed to touch anything but your wine glass.

201
00:13:36,409 --> 00:13:41,191
Tour the house, make a long distance phone call, whatever, it’s called relaxing.

202
00:13:41,472 --> 00:13:43,910
Well you know I do have some friends in Florence.

203
00:13:44,576 --> 00:13:45,917
Maybe I should give them a call.

204
00:13:51,792 --> 00:13:53,670
Haley, now this was a great idea.

205
00:13:54,330 --> 00:13:55,133
I know.

206
00:13:56,557 --> 00:13:58,492
Did you fill any with milk like we used to?

207
00:13:58,819 --> 00:14:00,805
Yeah I did. Some of them.

208
00:14:01,543 --> 00:14:07,180
I can’t do this stuff with Nathan. It just seems, I don’t know, does it seem childish?

209
00:14:07,309 --> 00:14:09,868
- Well, yeah.
- Great!

210
00:14:09,930 --> 00:14:10,815
But in a good way.

211
00:14:13,954 --> 00:14:17,108
So, what’s your situation now?

212
00:14:17,349 --> 00:14:18,188
What do you mean?

213
00:14:18,378 --> 00:14:22,792
With Peyton? Or Brooke. Or bar-slut that I heard about.

214
00:14:22,904 --> 00:14:26,570
Okay. What’d you hear and who’d you hear it from?

215
00:14:26,663 --> 00:14:28,762
Just stuff… from people.

216
00:14:29,709 --> 00:14:31,951
I just want to play ball again.

217
00:14:33,088 --> 00:14:35,341
You know? Get over this damn drama.

218
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:39,918
You know it wasn’t long ago I was happy playing hoops with the guys and hanging out with you.

219
00:14:40,159 --> 00:14:43,138
Yes, life was much simpler then, wasn’t it?

220
00:14:46,856 --> 00:14:48,324
I think I’m going to go call Nathan.

221
00:14:53,503 --> 00:14:58,243
Ohhh. You are so dead.

222
00:14:58,494 --> 00:15:00,332
I guess that one was a milk balloon.

223
00:15:07,784 --> 00:15:09,364
I think she likes you.

224
00:15:12,615 --> 00:15:16,133
So thanks for bringing me out tonight. I’ve never been to a real club before.

225
00:15:16,859 --> 00:15:17,975
I’m glad I brought you.

226
00:15:18,179 --> 00:15:18,790
Yeah?

227
00:15:19,137 --> 00:15:23,469
Yeah. I enjoy corrupting America’s youth. It’s kind of one of my hobbies.

228
00:15:23,666 --> 00:15:25,784
So was Lucas one of your test subjects?

229
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,845
Can we not go there tonight?

230
00:15:28,923 --> 00:15:31,436
Okay. Sorry.

231
00:15:34,062 --> 00:15:36,004
That girls practically naked up there.

232
00:15:36,817 --> 00:15:39,064
So you don’t like naked girls?

233
00:15:39,352 --> 00:15:41,436
Well I’ve never actually seen one up close.

234
00:15:41,528 --> 00:15:44,247
But from what I’ve found online I’m thinking they’re okay.

235
00:15:47,109 --> 00:15:47,738
What?

236
00:15:49,106 --> 00:15:50,636
Want to find out for sure?

237
00:15:54,825 --> 00:15:55,859
Let’s do some damage.

238
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:07,988
Kind of severe, huh?

239
00:16:09,442 --> 00:16:11,342
Kind of familiar, actually.

240
00:16:12,867 --> 00:16:17,358
You know when I was a cheerleader we buried a time capsule midfield of the football stadium.

241
00:16:18,593 --> 00:16:23,216
I bet if you dug it up you’d find a version of the same thing our kinds are going through now.

242
00:16:25,402 --> 00:16:29,037
Well, I got a couple of shovels in the garage.

243
00:16:29,861 --> 00:16:30,896
Want to find out?

244
00:16:31,827 --> 00:16:32,672
Yeah.

245
00:16:34,413 --> 00:16:37,018
- Sweet. You got a pool?
- Yeah. You want to go swimming?

246
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:39,585
No, you are the boy toy you do what I say tonight.

247
00:16:39,656 --> 00:16:41,289
Oh, just like old times.

248
00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:44,764
Please. You did whatever you wanted and most of the time it was either sucky or mean.

249
00:16:45,292 --> 00:16:46,967
I know. But you let me.

250
00:16:47,058 --> 00:16:50,244
Well maybe I kept thinking you’d change. Live and learn, right?

251
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:53,962
- Is this thing heated? 
- I don’t know, why don’t you check it out?

252
00:17:03,083 --> 00:17:04,826
Oh my god!

253
00:17:04,891 --> 00:17:06,765
- I slipped. 
- What?!

254
00:17:06,832 --> 00:17:09,496
I slipped. Hey, at least it’s heated.

255
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,873
Real thing sure beats the internet, huh?

256
00:17:45,374 --> 00:17:47,164
The internet sucks.

257
00:18:19,059 --> 00:18:20,029
Hello?

258
00:18:22,083 --> 00:18:22,973
Deb?

259
00:18:26,051 --> 00:18:27,530
Miss Deborah?

260
00:18:28,452 --> 00:18:30,377
Come on in, Timmy, I’m in the bath.

261
00:18:35,261 --> 00:18:37,084
Ready or not, here I come.

262
00:18:47,239 --> 00:18:48,121
Sorry!

263
00:18:48,989 --> 00:18:49,726
Timmy!

264
00:18:53,651 --> 00:18:57,086
I am so sorry. I don’t know what gave you the impression that...

265
00:18:57,152 --> 00:18:58,964
It’s okay. I’m fine. I'm fine...

266
00:18:59,842 --> 00:19:02,992
- It’s just that you startled me and... 
- Where’s my shirt?

267
00:19:14,494 --> 00:19:16,719
The lawyers are gonna love this one.

268
00:19:24,866 --> 00:19:25,607
Luke?

269
00:19:27,696 --> 00:19:31,419
I’m all out of balloons. Can we please call a truce?

270
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:35,591
- Is it a real truce or a trick truce?
- It’s a real truce, I promise.

271
00:19:37,526 --> 00:19:38,238
Okay.

272
00:19:39,605 --> 00:19:40,566
Okay.

273
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:43,655
Or not!

274
00:19:47,347 --> 00:19:49,522
No Luke, you’re going to hurt your shoulder.

275
00:19:50,128 --> 00:19:51,586
Oh you are so lucky.

276
00:19:53,557 --> 00:19:54,223
What?

277
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:58,299
- What’s on your back? 
- Nothing.

278
00:19:58,732 --> 00:20:01,502
- Haley, is that a tattoo?
- No. It’s nothing.

279
00:20:01,602 --> 00:20:02,462
Haley.

280
00:20:10,941 --> 00:20:12,260
23.

281
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:15,026
That’s great, Hales.

282
00:20:15,523 --> 00:20:17,370
You see, that’s why I don’t like the guy.

283
00:20:17,448 --> 00:20:19,223
- Lucas. 
- No, that’s just like him!

284
00:20:19,327 --> 00:20:22,056
To get you branded with his jersey number right above your ass?

285
00:20:22,118 --> 00:20:23,602
He doesn’t even know about it.

286
00:20:24,627 --> 00:20:26,234
I just, I just did it.

287
00:20:28,486 --> 00:20:29,363
By yourself?

288
00:20:30,494 --> 00:20:32,481
Yeah, by myself.

289
00:20:34,371 --> 00:20:35,802
Haley, why would you do that?

290
00:20:36,955 --> 00:20:38,332
Because I’m in love with him.

291
00:20:52,542 --> 00:20:54,882
Look, I didn’t mean to freak out on you up there, okay?

292
00:20:55,761 --> 00:20:58,111
But, a tattoo?

293
00:20:59,833 --> 00:21:03,437
You got one. You got one with a girl you’re not even dating anymore.

294
00:21:03,773 --> 00:21:04,584
I know.

295
00:21:05,479 --> 00:21:06,636
How stupid do I look?

296
00:21:07,973 --> 00:21:11,439
You hold me to a higher standard than everybody else, Luke, and it’s not fair.

297
00:21:11,777 --> 00:21:15,925
Look, I know it’s not fair, okay? But that’s because I’ve seen you be better than most people.

298
00:21:18,064 --> 00:21:19,172
Let me see it again.

299
00:21:25,070 --> 00:21:26,528
How long ago did you do it?

300
00:21:26,631 --> 00:21:27,588
A  few days ago.

301
00:21:28,239 --> 00:21:31,443
- And Nathan had nothing to do with it?
- No, I told you, Nathan doesn’t know.

302
00:21:34,152 --> 00:21:39,713
Ugh, God, what am I going to do, Luke? I’m so, I hate being away from him,

303
00:21:39,774 --> 00:21:43,153
I think about him constantly. I was in the middle of a history quiz yesterday

304
00:21:43,215 --> 00:21:45,279
and I just totally zoned out on him.

305
00:21:46,486 --> 00:21:49,728
Maybe we’re not going to be together for the rest of our lives,

306
00:21:49,927 --> 00:21:52,713
but right now I’m in love for the first time

307
00:21:52,861 --> 00:21:55,651
and if I look at this tattoo 20 years from now,

308
00:21:55,967 --> 00:21:58,016
and it reminds me of how I feel today,

309
00:21:58,877 --> 00:22:00,935
I think I’ll be okay with that.

310
00:22:02,323 --> 00:22:04,586
Then why didn’t you buy Nathan at the auction?

311
00:22:05,875 --> 00:22:07,243
Why hide out with me?

312
00:22:11,171 --> 00:22:16,403
Because, I wanted to remember for a night the way that things were.

313
00:22:18,266 --> 00:22:21,011
Everything was so much simpler when it was just you and me.

314
00:22:21,370 --> 00:22:24,737
And I’m used to being self-confident, and sensible and...

315
00:22:26,509 --> 00:22:29,392
I just really feel like a mess right now.

316
00:22:29,997 --> 00:22:31,211
You’re not a mess.

317
00:22:32,956 --> 00:22:34,128
You’re just in love.

318
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:37,365
And I’m not sure if he is.

319
00:22:41,189 --> 00:22:44,762
What happened to us, Peyton? We used to be good together.

320
00:22:44,903 --> 00:22:47,620
No, we weren’t. We just had sex a lot.

321
00:22:48,045 --> 00:22:49,073
You sure about that?

322
00:22:49,192 --> 00:22:52,376
Trust me. You’re the only guy I’ve been with.

323
00:22:54,096 --> 00:22:55,064
You knew that.

324
00:22:56,021 --> 00:23:00,307
Yeah, I know, I just, I figured since we broke up, maybe...

325
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:01,095
No.

326
00:23:02,846 --> 00:23:05,079
Yeah, me neither.

327
00:23:08,709 --> 00:23:10,282
It’s just sex, right?

328
00:23:13,066 --> 00:23:16,666
Okay, you know what, Nathan? Haley really deserves better than that.

329
00:23:17,018 --> 00:23:21,996
She really, really likes you and she’s good for you and more than that, she trusts you...

330
00:23:22,062 --> 00:23:23,783
- I know that. 
- And okay, fine.

331
00:23:23,844 --> 00:23:26,409
We could do it, right here in the pool, and nobody would know.

332
00:23:26,455 --> 00:23:27,550
- Peyton…
- But I would know,

333
00:23:27,637 --> 00:23:31,396
and you would know, but I wouldn’t do that to Haley. Or myself.

334
00:23:31,668 --> 00:23:33,427
Or even you for that matter. Cause you know what?

335
00:23:33,469 --> 00:23:37,883
If you screw things up with your relationship with her, than you’re a bigger jackass than even I thought.

336
00:23:38,354 --> 00:23:40,172
I know it would hurt Haley.

337
00:23:40,786 --> 00:23:45,333
The only reason I mentioned it, was to let you know that I’m not pressuring her.

338
00:23:46,223 --> 00:23:48,435
Right. I knew that.

339
00:23:52,112 --> 00:23:54,129
- You said I was good in bed. 
- No, I didn’t.

340
00:23:54,189 --> 00:23:57,015
- Oh yes you did.
- Oh, God, kill me.

341
00:24:02,195 --> 00:24:04,200
So I left school for good by the way.

342
00:24:04,805 --> 00:24:06,249
Thought I might transfer here.

343
00:24:07,804 --> 00:24:10,150
Will you at least tell me how she’s doing?

344
00:24:14,766 --> 00:24:15,719
Right.

345
00:24:18,525 --> 00:24:21,502
So I guess asking you how you’re doing is out of the question.

346
00:24:22,079 --> 00:24:22,898
You look good.

347
00:24:23,656 --> 00:24:24,767
Give me the keys, Nikki.

348
00:24:26,171 --> 00:24:27,081
Stop it.

349
00:24:28,009 --> 00:24:29,796
Come on. I missed you, Jake.

350
00:24:30,685 --> 00:24:32,248
Remember how good we were?

351
00:24:34,172 --> 00:24:36,691
I know it’s been hard for you, I do.

352
00:24:37,804 --> 00:24:39,226
Let me make it easier.

353
00:24:45,319 --> 00:24:46,604
Come back to me.

354
00:24:48,788 --> 00:24:50,489
We could be a family.

355
00:24:51,530 --> 00:24:52,246
Damn it.

356
00:24:53,829 --> 00:24:55,078
Damn it, Nikki.

357
00:24:57,658 --> 00:24:59,179
You almost had me again.

358
00:25:03,702 --> 00:25:06,286
You want to impress me with your Maternal instincts?

359
00:25:07,325 --> 00:25:08,031
Get out.

360
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:21,021
Why don’t you go buy all the things you think Jenny might need. I’ll wait.

361
00:25:21,108 --> 00:25:21,968
Okay.

362
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:26,713
Hey, by the way. She’s 9 months old, just incase you forgot.

363
00:25:27,319 --> 00:25:28,701
I’ll be fine.

364
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:32,847
Hey.

365
00:25:32,915 --> 00:25:34,301
Hey, Keith, come on in.

366
00:25:34,722 --> 00:25:37,836
I saw your car. So how did pimp duty go?

367
00:25:37,897 --> 00:25:40,109
That’s charity coordinator.

368
00:25:40,544 --> 00:25:42,923
Right. Assuming you’d raffle yourself off, huh?

369
00:25:43,088 --> 00:25:44,578
Nobody could afford me.

370
00:25:48,239 --> 00:25:49,960
I’m glad you came by, Keith.

371
00:25:51,491 --> 00:25:53,196
I’ve been wanting to ask you a question.

372
00:25:58,300 --> 00:26:00,337
When do you plan to start living?

373
00:26:01,454 --> 00:26:04,106
Well, I am living, coach.

374
00:26:04,435 --> 00:26:07,075
No you’re not. You’re dying.

375
00:26:07,619 --> 00:26:10,291
I for one think it’s a damn shame.

376
00:26:14,234 --> 00:26:16,764
You know what I’d change in my life if I could?

377
00:26:17,358 --> 00:26:19,041
I’d have Camilla back.

378
00:26:20,839 --> 00:26:23,383
Just to spend one more day with her.

379
00:26:24,270 --> 00:26:26,359
When we were young and in love.

380
00:26:28,879 --> 00:26:30,475
You love Karen, don’t you?

381
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:33,854
Yeah, I do.

382
00:26:35,216 --> 00:26:37,556
And I plan on telling her that it’s just...

383
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:40,971
things have been kind of messy since the accident, you know?

384
00:26:41,483 --> 00:26:42,504
I understand.

385
00:26:44,097 --> 00:26:46,142
There’s something you need to understand.

386
00:26:47,110 --> 00:26:49,374
Everyday you wait,

387
00:26:50,321 --> 00:26:53,152
is another day you’ll never get back again.

388
00:26:54,827 --> 00:26:56,456
Trust me on that, son.

389
00:26:57,345 --> 00:26:58,215
I know.

390
00:27:02,571 --> 00:27:06,997
So why don’t you have a girlfriend? You’re a nice guy.

391
00:27:07,668 --> 00:27:09,649
Well that’s the problem. I’m too nice.

392
00:27:10,402 --> 00:27:13,714
- Girls like jerks. 
- Yeah, tell me about it.

393
00:27:14,102 --> 00:27:14,963
You mean Lucas?

394
00:27:15,916 --> 00:27:17,892
I thought we weren’t going to talk about Lucas tonight,

395
00:27:17,938 --> 00:27:20,386
but I could just throw your ass out at the next light.

396
00:27:20,924 --> 00:27:24,553
Okay. So let me ask you a question.

397
00:27:25,884 --> 00:27:27,057
What do girls want?

398
00:27:27,590 --> 00:27:29,104
Half your paycheck.

399
00:27:35,304 --> 00:27:37,589
Here’s my philosophy on dating.

400
00:27:39,211 --> 00:27:42,949
It’s important to have somebody that can make you laugh.

401
00:27:43,457 --> 00:27:48,378
Somebody you can trust. Somebody that, you know, turns you on.

402
00:27:49,094 --> 00:27:55,453
And it’s really, really important that these three people don’t know each other.

403
00:28:00,675 --> 00:28:02,846
I got the cutest little stuffed animal.

404
00:28:06,397 --> 00:28:11,074
She has a purple monkey that she can’t sleep without. Anything else she ignores.

405
00:28:13,363 --> 00:28:17,617
You got the wrong formula. She needs a special kind because, well she wasn’t breastfeed.

406
00:28:18,628 --> 00:28:21,039
The alcohol in these wipes are bad for her skin.

407
00:28:22,205 --> 00:28:25,564
I buy her a special vitamin because she was a little underweight at her six month checkup.

408
00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:30,040
She doesn’t read. She sure as hell doesn’t smoke.

409
00:28:30,427 --> 00:28:33,194
Oh well look, at least you got the most expensive kind of ice cream.

410
00:28:33,255 --> 00:28:34,515
I got that for you.

411
00:28:35,559 --> 00:28:40,158
Cause on our third date you said that all you needed for life to be good was a pint of this ice cream.

412
00:28:42,522 --> 00:28:44,806
I want your life to be good, Jake.

413
00:28:46,435 --> 00:28:49,394
I want to be with the boy that told me those things.

414
00:28:51,442 --> 00:28:53,212
- Where did he go?
- You left him.

415
00:28:54,263 --> 00:28:56,591
Damn it, Nikki, it’s not fair for you to come back here and do this.

416
00:28:56,650 --> 00:28:59,030
It’s not fair to me, and it’s not fair to Jenny.

417
00:28:59,545 --> 00:29:01,324
I still love you, you know?

418
00:29:01,645 --> 00:29:05,839
It’s funny. I can’t tell you how many times I spent wondering

419
00:29:05,987 --> 00:29:08,076
when I was going to hear you say that again.

420
00:29:08,430 --> 00:29:12,484
Just hoping the next time the phone rang it’d be you, calling to say those words.

421
00:29:12,545 --> 00:29:13,047
Jake.

422
00:29:13,109 --> 00:29:18,680
And now that you’re here, I... I cant even remember why I needed to hear them.

423
00:29:19,775 --> 00:29:22,592
You should recognize this next move, Nikki. You perfected it.

424
00:29:23,544 --> 00:29:26,058
It called turning my back and leaving you behind.

425
00:29:35,577 --> 00:29:38,136
I don’t know about this, Larry. We’re trespassing.

426
00:29:38,218 --> 00:29:40,411
No we’re not. Our taxes paid for this place.

427
00:29:40,482 --> 00:29:43,886
Oh, okay, let’s try vandalism, theft…

428
00:29:43,953 --> 00:29:47,614
We loosen dirt, on a field we paid for, get property that belongs to you,

429
00:29:47,721 --> 00:29:50,265
and we put the dirt back. What could they charge for us?

430
00:29:51,270 --> 00:29:52,677
Immaturity.

431
00:29:53,015 --> 00:29:56,026
There’s a difference between growing up and growing old, Karen.

432
00:29:58,085 --> 00:29:59,385
Give me the shovel.

433
00:30:05,623 --> 00:30:09,517
I can’t believe you do this every night. You have the greatest life.

434
00:30:21,365 --> 00:30:22,220
Hi.

435
00:30:22,798 --> 00:30:24,770
You look hot tonight.

436
00:30:25,195 --> 00:30:25,921
Thanks.

437
00:30:31,247 --> 00:30:32,701
So, what’s your name?

438
00:30:34,488 --> 00:30:36,556
You don’t remember the last time we did this.

439
00:30:37,313 --> 00:30:40,585
You were pretty wasted. You’re name is Brooke, right?

440
00:30:47,175 --> 00:30:51,225
So, Brooke. Are we going to do this again, or what?

441
00:31:01,748 --> 00:31:02,499
You okay?

442
00:31:03,534 --> 00:31:04,669
I need to go home.

443
00:31:16,502 --> 00:31:18,264
Brooke, did something happen?

444
00:31:22,694 --> 00:31:24,040
Do you want to talk about it?

445
00:31:28,182 --> 00:31:30,205
How long have you known Lucas?

446
00:31:30,455 --> 00:31:32,635
Since 4th grade. I transferred in.

447
00:31:33,691 --> 00:31:35,252
And you think he’s a good guy?

448
00:31:36,504 --> 00:31:38,216
I think he’s a great guy.

449
00:31:38,944 --> 00:31:39,702
Why?

450
00:31:43,854 --> 00:31:46,044
Remember when I told you what girls want?

451
00:31:48,846 --> 00:31:51,330
Girls just want somebody to want them back.

452
00:31:53,201 --> 00:31:54,509
At least I do.

453
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:06,085
If it’s action that you’re craving, go and get yourself a Raven.

454
00:32:06,136 --> 00:32:09,137
We said go. Ravens. Go mighty Ravens.

455
00:32:09,188 --> 00:32:15,374
If you really want to score, gotta dig a little more. We say go, Ravens, go mighty Ravens.

456
00:32:15,424 --> 00:32:16,837
Oh. We got treasure.

457
00:32:20,565 --> 00:32:22,705
Oh yeah.

458
00:32:25,357 --> 00:32:26,914
- Check it out. 
- Oh!

459
00:32:35,987 --> 00:32:38,735
Bon Jovi. I saw that tour. Scorpions opened for them.

460
00:32:38,793 --> 00:32:39,432
Yeah.

461
00:32:40,588 --> 00:32:42,576
Oh no!

462
00:32:43,015 --> 00:32:45,577
- Check out the hair. 
- Me and Dan.

463
00:32:46,117 --> 00:32:47,464
Is that Keith?

464
00:32:48,204 --> 00:32:51,116
Yeah. He was always very protective.

465
00:32:52,595 --> 00:32:55,463
You know, I don’t think I ever noticed Keith in the picture before.

466
00:32:55,704 --> 00:32:59,405
Well, the kid in the background is definitely in love with the girl in the foreground.

467
00:33:01,586 --> 00:33:03,998
What in the sam hill is going on here?

468
00:33:04,109 --> 00:33:05,985
Oh my God.

469
00:33:06,742 --> 00:33:08,863
- Karen? 
- Hi, Whitey.

470
00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:10,403
Offer you a beer, coach?

471
00:33:11,705 --> 00:33:13,822
We were, um, having dinner and...

472
00:33:14,765 --> 00:33:15,712
Oh hey, Keith.

473
00:33:26,715 --> 00:33:30,448
It’s nearly midnight. Looks like our date’s almost over.

474
00:33:30,684 --> 00:33:31,333
Yeah.

475
00:33:34,011 --> 00:33:35,752
I think I was hitting on you in the pool.

476
00:33:36,193 --> 00:33:37,555
You think you were?

477
00:33:38,256 --> 00:33:43,817
I don’t know anymore. This whole good guy thing, it’s new to me.

478
00:33:47,098 --> 00:33:49,951
I guess I’ll always have feelings for you, Peyton.

479
00:33:51,813 --> 00:33:54,877
But I owe it to Haley to be a better guy than I’ve been.

480
00:33:56,939 --> 00:33:59,248
I just don’t want to be the kind of guy that cheats on her.

481
00:34:00,922 --> 00:34:02,008
Then don’t be.

482
00:34:04,988 --> 00:34:06,534
Nathan, I’m proud of you.

483
00:34:07,702 --> 00:34:11,914
You know, standing up to your dad, and being a good guy for Haley.

484
00:34:13,186 --> 00:34:15,975
You’re turning into the kind of guy I always knew you could be.

485
00:34:20,005 --> 00:34:22,331
- So Nathan got his own place.
- Yeah this is it.

486
00:34:22,396 --> 00:34:25,345
Oh crap. I left some cds for him in the car. I’ll be right back.

487
00:34:25,427 --> 00:34:26,610
- No, I’ll come. 
- No, it’s alright.

488
00:34:26,671 --> 00:34:29,114
Um, why don’t you go ahead and go on in, apartment 11.

489
00:34:29,210 --> 00:34:32,637
Hey, ask him if he’s in love with me, and if he says no, break up with him for me, okay?

490
00:34:32,708 --> 00:34:33,451
- Okay.
- Great.

491
00:34:33,567 --> 00:34:39,262
Hey. Seriously. Say something nice, okay? I mean, he’s really a different person.

492
00:34:40,081 --> 00:34:41,212
- Okay.
- Okay.

493
00:34:44,207 --> 00:34:46,557
- I better get going. 
- Okay.

494
00:34:48,088 --> 00:34:50,786
I guess by rule, I owe you a kiss.

495
00:34:51,339 --> 00:34:52,343
I guess so.

496
00:35:08,113 --> 00:35:09,444
He wasn’t there.

497
00:35:09,874 --> 00:35:11,324
Are you sure? Apartment 11?

498
00:35:11,597 --> 00:35:12,337
Yeah.

499
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:17,576
Voice mail. Great. I guess he’s not done yet. I told you Peyton was easy.

500
00:35:18,123 --> 00:35:19,464
Come on, I’ll take you home.

501
00:35:20,104 --> 00:35:20,827
Okay.

502
00:35:28,204 --> 00:35:30,426
I guess I should have told my parents I’d be out late.

503
00:35:31,966 --> 00:35:34,138
I’m not sure this was a good idea.

504
00:35:34,507 --> 00:35:36,185
Mouth, you’ve got to live a little.

505
00:35:36,299 --> 00:35:41,976
No, it’s not that. I mean, a night with you is like flying first class.

506
00:35:43,324 --> 00:35:44,492
My life is coach.

507
00:35:45,403 --> 00:35:47,353
It’s going to be hard going back to it.

508
00:35:48,740 --> 00:35:53,913
Thanks, but this gets old, pretty quick. Trust me.

509
00:35:55,172 --> 00:35:56,283
Listen, Brooke.

510
00:35:56,867 --> 00:36:00,347
I don’t know what’s going on with you and Lucas but he’s a really good guy.

511
00:36:01,562 --> 00:36:05,397
I’ve never been really good at sports, I mean, I’m little, you know.

512
00:36:06,830 --> 00:36:09,272
But when I decided I wanted to be a sports announcer,

513
00:36:09,508 --> 00:36:14,468
Lucas introduced me to the guys at the river court and it made me feel like I belonged.

514
00:36:16,231 --> 00:36:20,107
He has a good heart. And as far as I can tell, you do too.

515
00:36:21,719 --> 00:36:24,643
I’d be really surprised if you two couldn’t work things out.

516
00:36:25,809 --> 00:36:26,568
Thank you.

517
00:36:30,326 --> 00:36:34,252
Well, I should get home. That stripper might booty call me.

518
00:36:36,895 --> 00:36:37,673
Mouth.

519
00:36:46,165 --> 00:36:48,588
Oh right. For the charity thing.

520
00:36:49,045 --> 00:36:49,669
Nah.

521
00:36:51,295 --> 00:36:52,378
Just cause.

522
00:36:54,443 --> 00:36:55,475
Hey, Brooke.

523
00:36:57,064 --> 00:37:00,590
Thanks. This was the greatest night of my life.

524
00:37:14,481 --> 00:37:18,084
Well, did you have fun tonight, slave boy? Thanks for playing along.

525
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:23,303
Look, Haley. I know we’ve grown apart a bit lately.

526
00:37:24,178 --> 00:37:26,800
And I know we have a lot a head of us, but...

527
00:37:28,536 --> 00:37:30,978
I just want you to know I’ll always be there for you.

528
00:37:32,135 --> 00:37:38,290
And if Nathan doesn’t see how special you really are, well, then he’s an idiot.

529
00:37:39,024 --> 00:37:40,628
Cause I think you’re amazing.

530
00:37:42,345 --> 00:37:43,343
Thanks, Luke.

531
00:37:47,259 --> 00:37:50,464
Oh, technically you owe me a goodnight kiss.

532
00:37:53,061 --> 00:37:57,504
Mm. Rules are rules, I guess.

533
00:37:57,552 --> 00:37:59,122
Yeah, I guess so.

534
00:38:02,426 --> 00:38:04,407
Here’s the thing, though, if your tongue comes anywhere near my mouth

535
00:38:04,468 --> 00:38:05,866
I’m just never speaking to you again.

536
00:38:15,102 --> 00:38:16,126
Hey, Haley.

537
00:38:18,349 --> 00:38:19,666
You’re going to be okay.

538
00:38:20,755 --> 00:38:21,703
I promise you that.

539
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:44,518
- Nikki, don’t do this. 
- Jake, please.

540
00:38:44,866 --> 00:38:47,594
Keeping Jenny away from me because I hurt you is wrong.

541
00:38:55,418 --> 00:38:56,822
Can’t you just forgive me?

542
00:38:58,703 --> 00:38:59,897
It was a Wednesday.

543
00:39:00,697 --> 00:39:02,730
What? What was?

544
00:39:03,410 --> 00:39:05,699
The day I realized that you weren’t coming back.

545
00:39:07,702 --> 00:39:11,335
I loved you. You knew I loved you. I would have done anything for you.

546
00:39:11,904 --> 00:39:15,822
But you betrayed me. So it was that same Wednesday that I stopped loving you.

547
00:39:16,779 --> 00:39:21,725
And I promised myself that my daughter would never feel the pain that you caused me.

548
00:39:29,008 --> 00:39:30,399
You want to hear me say it?

549
00:39:31,157 --> 00:39:33,290
Fine. You broke my heart, Nikki.

550
00:39:34,065 --> 00:39:38,868
But you will never break my daughters heart because you will never, ever have the chance to.

551
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:43,603
I’m going to be in her life, Jake.

552
00:39:44,597 --> 00:39:47,458
With you or without you.

553
00:39:54,779 --> 00:39:57,412
So would you like some coffee?

554
00:39:57,498 --> 00:40:00,293
It’s getting late, I should probably go.

555
00:40:00,853 --> 00:40:05,030
I had a lot of fun tonight. I didn’t do much of this in high school.

556
00:40:05,127 --> 00:40:08,588
Well, maybe next time we could do something less juvenile.

557
00:40:08,716 --> 00:40:10,718
Oh well, if we have to.

558
00:40:15,508 --> 00:40:21,015
Karen, I know you have some history with Keith. I hope I didn’t cause any problems tonight.

559
00:40:21,982 --> 00:40:22,639
No.

560
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:27,128
But I like you. For what it’s worth.

561
00:40:28,910 --> 00:40:30,577
Well, I like you too, Larry.

562
00:40:32,166 --> 00:40:36,328
And you’re right. I do have history with Keith.

563
00:40:38,070 --> 00:40:39,769
I’m just not sure we have a future.

564
00:40:50,019 --> 00:40:50,988
Goodnight.

565
00:40:52,115 --> 00:40:53,105
Goodnight.

566
00:41:11,810 --> 00:41:12,452
Keith.

567
00:41:13,270 --> 00:41:14,648
It’s not too late, is it?

568
00:41:15,022 --> 00:41:17,243
No. Is everything okay?

569
00:41:17,350 --> 00:41:21,452
Not really. These last few weeks have been the hardest of my life.

570
00:41:23,389 --> 00:41:28,118
Being without you and Lucas, on the outside of your lives.

571
00:41:29,633 --> 00:41:34,548
I felt... I felt like a shadow of someone I used to be.

572
00:41:36,236 --> 00:41:40,796
And I know I let you down. And I put Lucas at risk,

573
00:41:41,118 --> 00:41:46,316
but you have to know, I love Lucas.

574
00:41:46,694 --> 00:41:52,787
And I’ve been carrying this around with me since the night of the accident.

575
00:41:57,205 --> 00:41:58,500
I love you Karen.

576
00:41:58,752 --> 00:41:59,731
Keith.

577
00:42:00,207 --> 00:42:01,413
I always have.

578
00:42:03,815 --> 00:42:04,690
Marry me.

579
00:42:23,536 --> 00:42:25,666
I need to talk to you.

580
00:42:27,669 --> 00:42:28,361
Okay.

581
00:42:29,856 --> 00:42:36,282
I spent the entire night trying to avoid this or ignore it,

582
00:42:36,466 --> 00:42:38,913
but I cant so I’ve just got to say it.

583
00:42:40,514 --> 00:42:41,672
Brooke what’s up?

584
00:42:44,868 --> 00:42:46,337
I think I’m pregnant.

585
00:42:48,692 --> 00:42:53,270
