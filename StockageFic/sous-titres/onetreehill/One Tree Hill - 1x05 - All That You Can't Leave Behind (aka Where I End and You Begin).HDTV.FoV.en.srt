1
00:02:03,849 --> 00:02:05,553
Hey, lets move it lady.

2
00:02:07,096 --> 00:02:08,099
Come on!

3
00:02:24,401 --> 00:02:25,137
Haley.

4
00:02:26,567 --> 00:02:28,694
- How long are we going to do this?
- Do what?

5
00:02:29,157 --> 00:02:32,168
- Avoid each other.
- You tell me. You’re the one upset.

6
00:02:32,301 --> 00:02:33,555
And you’re the one who lied to me.

7
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:35,496
I don’t know what to say to you, Luke.

8
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:39,566
Just explain to me why you were with Nathan. Huh?

9
00:02:40,017 --> 00:02:42,167
I mean, considering the past few weeks and what he’s done…

10
00:02:42,633 --> 00:02:43,494
I can’t.

11
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:46,760
You know how I feel about him, Haley.

12
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:48,740
Lucas, fine!

13
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:53,860
Yes. I know how you feel about him. But there is something you don’t know.

14
00:02:55,402 --> 00:02:57,762
I promised him I’d tutor him if he left you alone.

15
00:02:59,344 --> 00:03:00,092
What?

16
00:03:00,795 --> 00:03:02,237
I’m doing it for you, Luke.

17
00:04:15,925 --> 00:04:18,276
- So you and Peyton are history?
- Nah.

18
00:04:20,317 --> 00:04:22,546
- I wouldn’t count on that.
- No?

19
00:04:22,986 --> 00:04:26,053
Yeah. This is what she does. She freaks out, we break up;

20
00:04:26,426 --> 00:04:27,850
a few days later, we make up.

21
00:04:31,568 --> 00:04:32,781
So why put up with that?

22
00:04:33,636 --> 00:04:35,300
Because a few days later, we make up.

23
00:04:36,079 --> 00:04:37,077
Hey, ball.

24
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:44,398
Expect plenty more of that at the father/son game because we’re going to crush you guys.

25
00:04:44,474 --> 00:04:45,115
Oh yeah?

26
00:04:49,636 --> 00:04:51,075
You can expect more of that.

27
00:04:51,679 --> 00:04:52,376
Bring it on.

28
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:03,880
I’m an idiot.

29
00:05:05,591 --> 00:05:06,742
I know.

30
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:08,442
I’m sorry.

31
00:05:10,328 --> 00:05:11,874
I miss hanging out with you, Hales.

32
00:05:13,077 --> 00:05:14,823
Yeah. I miss hanging out with you too.

33
00:05:15,877 --> 00:05:19,180
Listen. I appreciate everything you did for me.

34
00:05:19,885 --> 00:05:23,951
I do, Haley, but- how about you let me handle the team from now on, okay?

35
00:05:26,006 --> 00:05:26,762
Okay.

36
00:05:27,525 --> 00:05:31,503
All right. So you can… stop tutoring Nathan now.

37
00:05:32,938 --> 00:05:35,206
Um, no. I can’t.

38
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:38,692
- Haley.
- Lucas. I can’t. I promised him.

39
00:05:38,758 --> 00:05:42,906
If I break that promise, I’m just as bad as... you think he is.

40
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:50,841
Hey, Lucas, I’m looking forward to see you play in the father/son game this year.

41
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:52,680
Good article about you and your pop.

42
00:06:02,562 --> 00:06:05,505
Who would’ve known that Dan Scott’s basketball pedigree would be inherited

43
00:06:05,546 --> 00:06:08,931
by his two sons, Nathan Scott and Lucas?

44
00:06:10,708 --> 00:06:12,045
You’ve got to be kidding me.

45
00:06:12,249 --> 00:06:15,122
That’s great, Dad. We’re all one big happy family now.

46
00:06:15,859 --> 00:06:19,740
Watch it. I wonder what they’re paying this reporter to support his crack habit?

47
00:06:19,826 --> 00:06:22,909
- How about some breakfast?
- I lost my appetite.

48
00:06:24,348 --> 00:06:27,967
Dan, the boy exists. He’s on the team. It’s not exactly headline news.

49
00:06:28,048 --> 00:06:29,586
No, Deb, apparently it is.

50
00:06:30,246 --> 00:06:32,489
Well, how do you think Lucas and Karen feel about it?

51
00:06:32,576 --> 00:06:35,462
Gosh, I don’t know. Maybe we should invite them over for breakfast and find out.

52
00:06:35,530 --> 00:06:37,543
Alright, look. If you guys are going to argue, I’m out of here.

53
00:06:37,604 --> 00:06:40,224
We’re not arguing and your breakfast is getting cold.

54
00:06:40,292 --> 00:06:42,764
I’m just going to grab something at school with my brother.

55
00:06:46,027 --> 00:06:50,966
You know, there is a chance that Lucas and Nathan can get along if their father encouraged it.

56
00:06:51,145 --> 00:06:55,334
True. But there’s also a chance that hell can freeze over.

57
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:04,018
You’re not still mad at me, are you?

58
00:07:04,735 --> 00:07:05,769
I’m not mad.

59
00:07:07,074 --> 00:07:08,006
We’re just over.

60
00:07:14,796 --> 00:07:17,325
Hey cutie. I saw your picture in the paper.

61
00:07:17,862 --> 00:07:19,916
Personally, I didn’t think it did you justice.

62
00:07:20,407 --> 00:07:21,774
- No?
- No.

63
00:07:22,957 --> 00:07:24,207
Far too much clothing.

64
00:07:46,339 --> 00:07:50,391
Hey, Lucas. That father verses son game’s coming up.

65
00:07:50,554 --> 00:07:51,833
Considered who you want to play with.

66
00:07:53,483 --> 00:07:55,823
- I figured I’d skip it.
- Oh, come on, son.

67
00:07:55,874 --> 00:07:58,865
I know it’s hard, but it will be worse if you don’t play.

68
00:07:59,658 --> 00:08:03,395
Besides, I thought you said you were through hiding from Dan.

69
00:08:03,825 --> 00:08:04,643
I am.

70
00:08:05,643 --> 00:08:07,558
Well, wouldn’t it be fun to dunk on him?

71
00:08:12,104 --> 00:08:15,914
Here we go! Ravens, lets score!

72
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:17,767
Wait! Hold on, Peyton, you’ve got the arms wrong.

73
00:08:17,885 --> 00:08:21,223
- It’s not brain surgery, Brooke.
- Okay, what’s with the attitude?

74
00:08:21,545 --> 00:08:22,780
What’s with your life?

75
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:26,185
Seriously, aren’t you embarrassed that the most important thing in your world is some stupid cheer?

76
00:08:26,281 --> 00:08:28,991
Look, I’m really sorry things didn’t work out with you and Nathan,

77
00:08:29,051 --> 00:08:32,339
- but don’t go all Mariah on me, okay?
- You think this is about Nathan?

78
00:08:32,658 --> 00:08:35,856
You’re not even close! You’re not even in the neighborhood of close!

79
00:08:35,918 --> 00:08:38,662
- Okay, then, what’s wrong?
- What’s wrong is how… pointless all of this is.

80
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:40,946
- Stop saying that!
- No! Because it’s true.

81
00:08:41,267 --> 00:08:45,415
What difference does it make if you sleep with a popular guy, or you go to the right party,

82
00:08:45,472 --> 00:08:49,947
or you know the moves to some moronic cheer to do with some lame-ass game I could care less about!

83
00:09:04,927 --> 00:09:08,788
- Hey. You’re not working today.
- Yeah, I have a favor to ask.

84
00:09:08,865 --> 00:09:12,833
Uh, there’s this father/son charity basketball game.

85
00:09:12,925 --> 00:09:16,535
Whitey says I’ve got to play, so… you interested?

86
00:09:17,635 --> 00:09:19,832
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

87
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:23,887
Yeah, okay. Of course, I might be, you know, a little out of shape,

88
00:09:24,809 --> 00:09:28,531
not to mention I… wasn’t worth a crap back in high school.

89
00:09:28,654 --> 00:09:30,062
Well, it’s better for us, right?

90
00:09:30,651 --> 00:09:32,453
Well. Why don’t you start coming to the court with us?

91
00:09:32,617 --> 00:09:35,700
Hang with a member of the Scott basketball dynasty?

92
00:09:38,229 --> 00:09:39,371
So how are you doing with that?

93
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:41,199
Well. What are you going to do?

94
00:09:42,033 --> 00:09:44,460
- Sucks for my mom…
- Yeah. What about you?

95
00:09:45,064 --> 00:09:49,309
Honestly… I can’t stand being connected to Nathan or Dan.

96
00:09:50,302 --> 00:09:51,495
Hey, big brother!

97
00:09:52,047 --> 00:09:54,463
I was getting some cardio in, ran out of water. You wanna help me out?

98
00:09:55,202 --> 00:09:56,436
Yeah. Sure, why not?

99
00:09:57,086 --> 00:10:01,515
So, uh, you wanna buy some charity tickets to the big father/son game?

100
00:10:02,118 --> 00:10:04,546
Oh,  well, I, you know, could if I wasn’t playing in it.

101
00:10:05,289 --> 00:10:06,209
Luke invited me.

102
00:10:07,583 --> 00:10:08,555
Oh, great.

103
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:12,027
Well, try not to soil the Scott family name while you’re at it.

104
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:14,135
Yeah… that’s every day advice for you, huh?

105
00:10:16,138 --> 00:10:16,998
Hey, kid.

106
00:10:18,523 --> 00:10:20,792
Seems as though you have an obligation to the family name too.

107
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:22,107
Don’t blow it.

108
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:24,754
That article’s a lie.

109
00:10:25,476 --> 00:10:27,238
You’re not my father and you never were.

110
00:10:27,986 --> 00:10:29,787
You’re  right. It is a lie.

111
00:10:30,688 --> 00:10:32,879
You should never have had the name in the first place.

112
00:10:33,397 --> 00:10:35,182
Hey! Dan!

113
00:10:40,882 --> 00:10:43,888
- You okay?
- Look! I have no responsibility to him or his name.

114
00:10:43,964 --> 00:10:47,016
Just… Don’t let him get inside your head, okay?

115
00:10:47,304 --> 00:10:49,351
You know what. I don’t plan on it. You know, as a matter of fact,

116
00:10:49,525 --> 00:10:53,001
I think it’s about time I get out from under this guy completely.

117
00:10:53,421 --> 00:10:54,575
What’s that supposed to mean?

118
00:10:55,076 --> 00:10:56,873
Meaning I’m not gonna be a Scott anymore.

119
00:10:58,748 --> 00:11:00,657
I’m gonna change my last name.

120
00:11:14,041 --> 00:11:18,351
You’re late. I expected you this morning after that article in the paper.

121
00:11:18,721 --> 00:11:21,223
I understand Lucas has asked Keith to play in the basketball game.

122
00:11:21,992 --> 00:11:23,912
- Do you think that’s wise?
- Why not?

123
00:11:25,145 --> 00:11:27,244
Well, Keith isn’t exactly a father.

124
00:11:27,798 --> 00:11:31,315
You’re not the best father, either, Danny, and you’re playing.

125
00:11:31,545 --> 00:11:32,498
What about Lucas?

126
00:11:33,123 --> 00:11:35,034
You have to know this will be embarrassing for him.

127
00:11:35,237 --> 00:11:36,337
Embarrassing for him?

128
00:11:37,126 --> 00:11:39,256
What about embarrassing for you?

129
00:11:40,414 --> 00:11:41,283
Wait a minute.

130
00:11:42,541 --> 00:11:44,545
This isn’t about Lucas and Keith.

131
00:11:45,488 --> 00:11:47,249
This is all about you, Danny…

132
00:11:48,094 --> 00:11:53,269
and that feeling you get in the pit of your stomach when you see the son that you…

133
00:11:53,905 --> 00:11:55,200
never claimed.

134
00:11:57,203 --> 00:11:58,594
You were a great player.

135
00:11:59,813 --> 00:12:01,985
Maybe the best I ever had.

136
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:06,499
But you can score a hundred points in this game,

137
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:09,445
and that feeling’s not going to go away.

138
00:12:10,576 --> 00:12:15,486
It’ll be there until you acknowledge that Lucas is your son

139
00:12:15,957 --> 00:12:17,575
and that you made a mistake.

140
00:12:28,148 --> 00:12:30,697
You uncle Keith’s been working hard getting ready for the game.

141
00:12:33,196 --> 00:12:36,560
He mentioned that you’re thinking of changing your last name?

142
00:12:37,471 --> 00:12:41,205
I just don’t want people to read these stupid articles and think I played ball just because Dan did.

143
00:12:42,848 --> 00:12:45,095
I don’t want you to have to read that stuff.

144
00:12:46,410 --> 00:12:48,410
Well, you’re in the spotlight now.

145
00:12:49,410 --> 00:12:51,200
The article’s come with the territory.

146
00:12:51,990 --> 00:12:53,690
But I don’t want you to run away from that.

147
00:12:55,427 --> 00:12:57,506
I’d rather you face your problems head on.

148
00:12:57,797 --> 00:13:01,597
I just… figured it would make you happy if I took your name.

149
00:13:06,436 --> 00:13:11,510
When I found out I was pregnant, Dan already had a basketball scholarship

150
00:13:11,571 --> 00:13:13,660
and nothing was going to get in the way of that.

151
00:13:15,406 --> 00:13:17,433
But then something strange happened.

152
00:13:18,478 --> 00:13:21,598
Right before classes started, Dan changed his mind.

153
00:13:22,011 --> 00:13:25,041
He said he’d finish the semester and… we’d get married.

154
00:13:26,541 --> 00:13:30,511
So when I went into labor and you appeared,

155
00:13:31,402 --> 00:13:34,498
the nurse asked for your name and I said it was Scott.

156
00:13:36,451 --> 00:13:37,796
Keith was there,

157
00:13:38,932 --> 00:13:41,831
and when the nurse brought you in she let him hold you.

158
00:13:43,183 --> 00:13:45,625
I’ve known Keith my whole life,

159
00:13:47,075 --> 00:13:49,696
and that’s the only time I’ve seen him cry.

160
00:13:53,203 --> 00:13:54,846
Your father never showed up.

161
00:13:56,664 --> 00:13:57,851
So to hell with him.

162
00:13:58,916 --> 00:14:00,084
I don’t want his name.

163
00:14:01,266 --> 00:14:03,198
Keith’s a Scott too, you know.

164
00:14:05,332 --> 00:14:08,656
I’ve never been ashamed of you, Lucas, not for a second. Or your name.

165
00:14:09,212 --> 00:14:12,598
Then I also never had to carry that name in this town the way you have,

166
00:14:12,674 --> 00:14:15,778
so if you want to change it, you have my blessing.

167
00:14:16,873 --> 00:14:18,516
But it’s just a name, Luke.

168
00:14:19,376 --> 00:14:21,419
What you do with it is up to you.

169
00:14:31,906 --> 00:14:32,597
Brooke!

170
00:14:33,687 --> 00:14:35,356
Hey. Have you heard from Peyton?

171
00:14:35,863 --> 00:14:39,170
Not since you two broke up and she went psycho on me in practice. Why?

172
00:14:39,641 --> 00:14:40,855
Because she’s not in school.

173
00:14:41,306 --> 00:14:43,191
And she won’t pick up at home or on her cell.

174
00:14:43,779 --> 00:14:46,165
Well… maybe she’s out kicking the homeless.

175
00:14:56,768 --> 00:14:58,934
A lot of smokers in this place.

176
00:14:59,762 --> 00:15:00,993
I don’t really smoke.

177
00:15:01,534 --> 00:15:04,877
I just figured since Nathan and I broke up, I’ve got room for a new bad habit.

178
00:15:06,296 --> 00:15:07,715
Mind if I sit down?

179
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:19,224
She was quite a gal, your mother.

180
00:15:20,110 --> 00:15:20,981
Yeah.

181
00:15:21,452 --> 00:15:24,340
She used to lead cheers for my team, too.

182
00:15:27,515 --> 00:15:29,368
And you’ve got her looks.

183
00:15:31,139 --> 00:15:34,123
- I don’t really remember her.
- Oh, I do.

184
00:15:34,222 --> 00:15:38,178
She was a wily one. Your old man didn’t stand a chance.

185
00:15:42,853 --> 00:15:45,460
So what are you doing here? Making a reservation?

186
00:15:46,186 --> 00:15:47,816
You better watch it!

187
00:15:48,696 --> 00:15:49,453
No.

188
00:15:51,533 --> 00:15:54,415
No. My wife, Camilla, is buried out here.

189
00:15:55,532 --> 00:15:58,276
Right over behind those trees.

190
00:15:59,489 --> 00:16:03,508
I couldn’t get in a word edgewise while she was alive so I come out here

191
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:08,357
and visit, tell her about things.

192
00:16:09,268 --> 00:16:10,609
You think she’s listening?

193
00:16:11,889 --> 00:16:15,346
Yeah. I know she’s listening.

194
00:16:17,931 --> 00:16:25,626
I lost my wife just about the time your mother passed away.

195
00:16:27,802 --> 00:16:30,762
That always make us weak and tough one.

196
00:16:31,914 --> 00:16:33,020
They’re all tough.

197
00:16:34,433 --> 00:16:35,278
Yeah.

198
00:16:40,286 --> 00:16:43,742
The good news is you did better… and the bad news is better is a D.

199
00:16:44,228 --> 00:16:46,527
Yeah. I guess I didn’t really give this one my best shot.

200
00:16:47,121 --> 00:16:48,339
What’s  going on with you?

201
00:16:48,595 --> 00:16:50,326
Well. You know me and Peyton broke up.

202
00:16:50,536 --> 00:16:53,183
- Peyton and I.
- Oh. She broke up with you too?

203
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:58,636
Just… I didn’t know she was going to take it this hard.

204
00:16:59,276 --> 00:17:01,068
She went off on Brooke at practice.

205
00:17:02,208 --> 00:17:03,725
I’m kinda worried about her.

206
00:17:03,918 --> 00:17:06,304
Well, maybe you should’ve worried more about her when you were together.

207
00:17:06,817 --> 00:17:08,854
- I’m sorry, but come on, it’s true.
- No!

208
00:17:09,034 --> 00:17:10,898
You don’t know the first thing about Peyton and I.

209
00:17:13,742 --> 00:17:15,715
- Me and Peyton.
- Whatever.

210
00:17:30,712 --> 00:17:31,767
Why do you do this?

211
00:17:37,108 --> 00:17:39,095
If I were you, I’d get back out now.

212
00:17:39,550 --> 00:17:41,214
Not until you tell me what’s going on.

213
00:17:48,761 --> 00:17:50,634
Come on! Slow down, Peyton! Come on!

214
00:17:51,668 --> 00:17:52,974
Slow the car down!

215
00:17:55,299 --> 00:17:57,701
Peyton? Slow the car down.

216
00:17:58,356 --> 00:18:00,582
She was driving to school to pick me up.

217
00:18:01,204 --> 00:18:04,438
She was late, so she ran a red light.

218
00:18:07,567 --> 00:18:10,496
It was one light at the wrong split second and it ended for her.

219
00:18:20,455 --> 00:18:22,589
My mom ran one red light.

220
00:18:24,392 --> 00:18:26,832
I run them all the time and nothing happens.

221
00:18:29,301 --> 00:18:30,520
It’s not fair.

222
00:18:31,426 --> 00:18:32,446
No it’s not.

223
00:18:35,488 --> 00:18:36,757
You can get out now.

224
00:18:38,127 --> 00:18:39,628
Or I can stay if you want.

225
00:18:41,513 --> 00:18:44,027
No. You can’t.

226
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:08,116
- Hey, Keith.
- Hey.

227
00:19:08,208 --> 00:19:10,319
Twice in a week. It’s got to be some kind of record.

228
00:19:10,487 --> 00:19:12,565
Yeah, well, it’s this father/son thing.

229
00:19:13,297 --> 00:19:16,454
- Yeah. How about a frostie?
- Nope, I’m in training.

230
00:19:19,551 --> 00:19:23,195
- It’s just a game, Dan.
- No. It’s a public event.

231
00:19:23,779 --> 00:19:26,907
I mean, what are people gonna think? Especially after that article?

232
00:19:27,055 --> 00:19:28,643
Oh yeah. About that…

233
00:19:29,437 --> 00:19:32,360
what in the hell is wrong with you telling Lucas he never deserved the name Scott?

234
00:19:33,046 --> 00:19:35,390
- Well, he doesn’t.
- The hell he doesn’t.

235
00:19:35,923 --> 00:19:38,305
- You fathered him, Dan.
- That’s right.

236
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:43,173
Which brings me to my original point. What do you think you’re doing playing in the basketball game?

237
00:19:43,219 --> 00:19:47,111
I mean, whatever you think you are to Karen and her son, you’re not a husband. Or a father.

238
00:19:48,443 --> 00:19:50,230
How much does a suit like that cost?

239
00:19:52,046 --> 00:19:56,224
Because it’s gonna look like hell when I lay you out all over that greasy floor.

240
00:19:57,275 --> 00:19:59,363
- Come on, big brother.
- That’s right. Big brother.

241
00:19:59,447 --> 00:20:01,995
And no matter what you did on that basketball court a lifetime ago,

242
00:20:02,072 --> 00:20:04,708
and no matter what you do now, I’ll always be your big brother.

243
00:20:05,062 --> 00:20:09,118
So guess what, Danny boy? It was my name first. It’s Lucas’ name now.

244
00:20:10,279 --> 00:20:11,902
And there’s nothing you can do about it.

245
00:20:13,228 --> 00:20:14,437
Okay, Keith.

246
00:20:14,867 --> 00:20:17,074
You know, you can be ashamed of me.

247
00:20:17,959 --> 00:20:19,521
And you can be ashamed of Lucas.

248
00:20:20,632 --> 00:20:26,597
But what makes YOU think we’re not just as ashamed of you? Huh?

249
00:20:27,653 --> 00:20:28,891
Now get out of my shop.

250
00:20:44,874 --> 00:20:45,880
Hi.

251
00:20:49,013 --> 00:20:53,415
You never know who you’re going to see in the boys’ locker room these days.

252
00:20:53,810 --> 00:20:54,942
Or what you’ll see.

253
00:20:56,309 --> 00:20:57,707
I thought maybe we could talk.

254
00:20:58,229 --> 00:20:59,586
Unless… you’re too busy.

255
00:21:00,482 --> 00:21:01,905
No, sure. We can talk.

256
00:21:03,656 --> 00:21:04,813
Still in denial?

257
00:21:06,483 --> 00:21:07,266
About what?

258
00:21:07,993 --> 00:21:08,986
Missing her.

259
00:21:10,553 --> 00:21:11,853
It’s okay that you do.

260
00:21:13,297 --> 00:21:14,901
What… are you my tutor or my shrink?

261
00:21:15,638 --> 00:21:16,821
Whatever you need.

262
00:21:20,011 --> 00:21:22,202
I treated Peyton pretty bad.

263
00:21:22,846 --> 00:21:24,520
She had every right to walk away.

264
00:21:26,496 --> 00:21:29,804
Okay, yeah, it was my fault. I screwed up.

265
00:21:31,412 --> 00:21:33,046
I just wish I had another chance.

266
00:21:36,737 --> 00:21:37,587
Nice work.

267
00:21:38,993 --> 00:21:43,664
- That was the truth.
- No. On your practice exam. 81.

268
00:21:46,808 --> 00:21:47,827
You know, it’s funny.

269
00:21:49,204 --> 00:21:52,405
I think we’ve actually talked more than Peyton and I ever did.

270
00:21:53,372 --> 00:21:55,763
Peyton and I… good job.

271
00:21:56,055 --> 00:21:57,673
Yeah, you too.

272
00:21:57,929 --> 00:21:59,664
Hey… are you coming to the game?

273
00:22:00,570 --> 00:22:03,693
Um, well, it depends on how you do on your English exam.

274
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:07,258
Anything less than an 81, I’m staying home and watching The Office.

275
00:22:07,396 --> 00:22:08,118
Alright.

276
00:22:09,050 --> 00:22:09,929
Haley?

277
00:22:10,699 --> 00:22:11,421
Yeah?

278
00:22:12,158 --> 00:22:13,893
I know this hasn’t been easy for you.

279
00:22:14,949 --> 00:22:17,129
I just wanted to say thanks.

280
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:20,232
Good luck.

281
00:22:27,570 --> 00:22:30,948
My wife wouldn’t let me smoke in the house, so...

282
00:22:31,133 --> 00:22:33,677
I got in the habit of coming up here to this bridge.

283
00:22:34,630 --> 00:22:37,810
I’d offer you one, but I know you’re trying to cut down.

284
00:22:39,739 --> 00:22:42,197
- How long have you been coaching?
- Too long.

285
00:22:43,396 --> 00:22:45,848
- Do you ever wonder about it?
- What?

286
00:22:46,407 --> 00:22:49,064
I mean, you’ve spent your whole life watching boy’s play a game.

287
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:54,925
Well, I’d prefer to think I was teaching them to play.

288
00:22:56,733 --> 00:23:03,261
Yeah, sometimes I think about the conversations when I’m finished between me and my wife.

289
00:23:03,983 --> 00:23:07,076
The holidays I missed because I was off coaching somewhere.

290
00:23:08,314 --> 00:23:11,473
That’s when I come closest to thinking it was a mistake.

291
00:23:14,786 --> 00:23:16,936
- Do you miss her?
- Every day.

292
00:23:20,024 --> 00:23:23,885
Peyton, it’s hard to lose somebody.

293
00:23:25,922 --> 00:23:30,515
I spent a lot of time searching for reasons or answers.

294
00:23:31,452 --> 00:23:33,766
But you can’t find what’s not there.

295
00:23:34,565 --> 00:23:35,885
It just happened.

296
00:23:37,748 --> 00:23:39,931
So you gonna light that thing or what?

297
00:23:40,330 --> 00:23:47,683
No. I used to love cigars but I haven’t smoked one since I lost Camilla.

298
00:23:48,542 --> 00:23:50,407
I don’t even carry matches anymore.

299
00:23:53,284 --> 00:23:55,500
I don’t guess I’ve been much help to you.

300
00:23:56,279 --> 00:23:57,888
But  I do know one thing.

301
00:23:59,141 --> 00:24:01,128
Your mother’s proud of you.

302
00:24:03,053 --> 00:24:04,564
Take care of yourself, kiddo.

303
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:16,011
- Hey.
- Hey.

304
00:24:19,006 --> 00:24:20,856
I really don’t want to be like this, Luke.

305
00:24:21,095 --> 00:24:21,915
What is that?

306
00:24:22,796 --> 00:24:26,933
This. Us skirting around each other. I mean, we’re friends.

307
00:24:27,973 --> 00:24:30,845
You know, when you wanted to join the team,

308
00:24:31,490 --> 00:24:34,910
I didn’t understand it and I told you that, but I supported you.

309
00:24:35,484 --> 00:24:38,602
- I know.
- So… support me!

310
00:24:39,430 --> 00:24:41,662
When I’m tutoring someone, and they get it,

311
00:24:41,893 --> 00:24:46,333
and that light goes on, I feel good! I feel worthy.

312
00:24:46,425 --> 00:24:48,887
The same way that you feel when you play basketball.

313
00:24:49,922 --> 00:24:52,036
Besides, having things gotten better for you?

314
00:24:52,312 --> 00:24:54,309
The team’s left you alone, the hazing’s stopped?

315
00:24:56,067 --> 00:24:59,916
Yeah. So, that’s worth the risk for me.

316
00:25:00,714 --> 00:25:02,789
What’s not worth the risk it us.

317
00:25:03,009 --> 00:25:05,809
We’re friends and that is important to me.

318
00:25:07,504 --> 00:25:08,902
You’re just tutoring him?

319
00:25:09,147 --> 00:25:13,622
I am just tutoring him. That’s it.

320
00:25:14,395 --> 00:25:15,307
Okay.

321
00:25:25,307 --> 00:25:27,821
- Oh, game.
- I think I pulled a kidney.

322
00:25:29,289 --> 00:25:31,302
- You alright?
- Yeah.

323
00:25:34,149 --> 00:25:35,055
Yeah…

324
00:25:38,492 --> 00:25:41,307
So you decide on the name thing yet?

325
00:25:42,013 --> 00:25:46,441
Well, I downloaded the forms. But, uh… Mom’s still got to sign off on them.

326
00:25:47,277 --> 00:25:48,643
Mind if I tell you what I think?

327
00:25:49,789 --> 00:25:50,810
I think you just did.

328
00:25:52,110 --> 00:25:56,380
Hey, I know I’m not your father, and, I’d never try to tell you what to do, but…

329
00:25:58,055 --> 00:26:01,271
I just… wish you’d think about it.

330
00:26:03,237 --> 00:26:04,132
I will…

331
00:26:05,832 --> 00:26:07,885
and you know you don’t have to play if you don’t want to.

332
00:26:08,622 --> 00:26:09,811
Oh. Why do you say that?

333
00:26:11,029 --> 00:26:14,376
I know it puts you in a weird spot.

334
00:26:14,674 --> 00:26:16,907
And Dan and Nathan are your family too, right?

335
00:26:18,402 --> 00:26:22,041
As far as I’m concerned, you and your mom are my family.

336
00:26:22,236 --> 00:26:23,373
As long as you’ll have me.

337
00:26:24,689 --> 00:26:30,137
You know, Dan and I, we... we’ve never seen eye to eye. Even when we were kids.

338
00:26:30,202 --> 00:26:33,126
And Nathan’s practically a stranger.

339
00:26:34,816 --> 00:26:35,882
Besides,

340
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:40,453
I was honored that you asked me to play.

341
00:26:41,590 --> 00:26:42,552
Good.

342
00:26:43,725 --> 00:26:45,312
I was hoping you’d say that.

343
00:26:47,111 --> 00:26:48,564
Listen. I’ve got to take off.

344
00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:51,232
Talk to you later?

345
00:26:52,265 --> 00:26:52,931
Si.

346
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:55,219
Take care, all right.

347
00:26:56,633 --> 00:26:58,230
- Hey, Keith?
- Yeah.

348
00:26:59,234 --> 00:27:01,302
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

349
00:27:10,303 --> 00:27:11,086
How’s my boy?

350
00:27:12,275 --> 00:27:12,960
Why?

351
00:27:14,103 --> 00:27:16,396
Dad send you to spy on me? Where’s my drink?

352
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:27,291
You know, you’d think he organized this entire thing himself.

353
00:27:27,594 --> 00:27:29,176
Just so he could get back on the court.

354
00:27:31,264 --> 00:27:34,056
I know he’s been tough on you lately, Nate.

355
00:27:34,148 --> 00:27:37,572
But I want you to know things are going to change around here.

356
00:27:38,166 --> 00:27:39,882
I just wish he’d lay off, you know.

357
00:27:41,331 --> 00:27:42,406
I wanna do good for him.

358
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:45,719
He just gets so worked up about this stuff.

359
00:27:46,425 --> 00:27:49,636
Well, if you don’t want to play, don’t play.

360
00:27:50,732 --> 00:27:52,119
He’ll get over it.

361
00:27:54,044 --> 00:27:55,570
You know that’s a lie, Mom.

362
00:28:06,405 --> 00:28:07,085
Hey.

363
00:28:09,890 --> 00:28:11,110
I’ve been thinking about you.

364
00:28:12,291 --> 00:28:13,622
Try a cold shower.

365
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:18,415
Sorry. You set yourself up for that one.

366
00:28:19,302 --> 00:28:20,284
Yeah, I guess so.

367
00:28:22,117 --> 00:28:22,982
How you doing?

368
00:28:23,748 --> 00:28:25,163
Lets see.

369
00:28:25,811 --> 00:28:29,387
I broke up with my boyfriend. My mom’s dead.

370
00:28:30,028 --> 00:28:32,578
And my dad’s away on a job.

371
00:28:33,637 --> 00:28:34,641
What’s your dad do?

372
00:28:35,195 --> 00:28:37,073
Captains a drudging boat.

373
00:28:38,061 --> 00:28:43,278
He’s only here for those forked anniversaries but this year, he sent his sympathies in an email.

374
00:28:45,255 --> 00:28:46,467
I read your article.

375
00:28:47,637 --> 00:28:50,999
I think it seemed like you guys are just one great, big, happy family.

376
00:28:51,086 --> 00:28:52,310
Yeah. It’s kind of ironic, huh?

377
00:28:53,232 --> 00:28:57,452
You know, I would gladly erase my dad if it would bring back your mom.

378
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:02,131
I wish I could change it for you.

379
00:29:04,153 --> 00:29:05,253
Thank you.

380
00:29:08,576 --> 00:29:10,113
I gotta go.

381
00:29:12,074 --> 00:29:12,846
Hey, Peyton!

382
00:29:14,486 --> 00:29:15,677
Don’t ruin it, okay?

383
00:29:26,774 --> 00:29:28,356
Excited about your game tomorrow?

384
00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:32,174
Truthfully? It’s like Christmas Eve.

385
00:29:34,403 --> 00:29:38,201
And have you been naughty… or nice?

386
00:29:38,519 --> 00:29:42,016
Have I been naughty? Well, which would you prefer?

387
00:29:46,947 --> 00:29:53,864
Honey. I know this is important to you and I know that Nathan is talented but…

388
00:29:55,077 --> 00:29:57,494
I think you push him too hard sometimes.

389
00:29:58,859 --> 00:30:02,277
I worry that he won’t enjoy it anymore.

390
00:30:02,849 --> 00:30:06,557
Oh, he enjoys it. If he doesn’t, he’ll regret it when it’s gone.

391
00:30:07,371 --> 00:30:08,231
Do you?

392
00:30:09,331 --> 00:30:10,080
Every day.

393
00:30:12,598 --> 00:30:14,077
There’s nothing like it, Deb.

394
00:30:15,107 --> 00:30:18,266
Walking into the arena, hearing the cheers of a sellout crowd,

395
00:30:18,641 --> 00:30:20,345
knowing it’s going to be your night.

396
00:30:22,055 --> 00:30:24,984
And for an hour or two, the world is yours

397
00:30:25,808 --> 00:30:27,979
and there’s nothing they can do to stop it.

398
00:30:29,889 --> 00:30:32,658
I wish I would’ve known you then. I wish you could’ve been there.

399
00:30:33,493 --> 00:30:37,743
No decisions to make, cars to sell, bills to pay.

400
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:40,215
Just the game.

401
00:30:42,065 --> 00:30:43,452
And I was good.

402
00:30:48,675 --> 00:30:50,600
It’s the best it ever was for me.

403
00:30:52,812 --> 00:30:54,415
Better than your life now?

404
00:30:55,423 --> 00:30:58,264
Better than... knowing your son?

405
00:30:59,110 --> 00:31:00,149
Or me?

406
00:31:04,056 --> 00:31:05,264
It was different.

407
00:31:18,488 --> 00:31:19,600
What do you call that?

408
00:31:20,409 --> 00:31:21,391
Love.

409
00:31:24,037 --> 00:31:25,190
What do you want, Nathan?

410
00:31:27,301 --> 00:31:28,601
It’s what I don’t want.

411
00:31:31,218 --> 00:31:32,671
I don’t want this for us.

412
00:31:33,189 --> 00:31:35,017
Maybe you should’ve thought of that sooner.

413
00:31:36,353 --> 00:31:37,417
Yeah, I know.

414
00:31:39,856 --> 00:31:42,296
I’ve been thinking about how we were when we started going out.

415
00:31:44,227 --> 00:31:45,887
Like that day at Rhysfield Beach.

416
00:31:46,827 --> 00:31:48,313
The nights here in your room.

417
00:31:49,425 --> 00:31:51,692
We haven’t been that way in a long time.

418
00:31:52,338 --> 00:31:53,300
We could be.

419
00:31:55,422 --> 00:31:58,967
Come on, Peyton. I’ve been thinking about you.

420
00:31:59,889 --> 00:32:01,573
I know you’ve been thinking about me.

421
00:32:03,632 --> 00:32:05,512
I’ve actually had a lot going on lately.

422
00:32:07,072 --> 00:32:08,260
Yeah, me too.

423
00:32:08,875 --> 00:32:12,614
My dad’s been going crazy about this father/son game and my mom…

424
00:32:13,182 --> 00:32:15,557
it’s like ever since she came back she’s been wanting to hang out.

425
00:32:15,613 --> 00:32:17,379
I really can’t hear this right now.

426
00:32:20,374 --> 00:32:23,876
Alright. Well, how about you come to the game?

427
00:32:24,629 --> 00:32:26,206
Maybe we could hang out afterwards.

428
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:37,230
I miss you, Peyton.

429
00:32:40,237 --> 00:32:41,413
I’ll see you there.

430
00:32:59,431 --> 00:33:00,639
Catch up to you later man.

431
00:33:01,739 --> 00:33:04,121
- Got a sec?
- Hey, yeah, what’s up?

432
00:33:05,073 --> 00:33:05,993
Check that out.

433
00:33:06,553 --> 00:33:09,338
An 84! That’s so great.

434
00:33:10,762 --> 00:33:12,651
Yeah, hey, congratulations!

435
00:33:29,311 --> 00:33:32,901
Hey! Dan the man, are you going to carry us tonight or what?

436
00:33:32,992 --> 00:33:36,193
You know it, Bruce. I’ll carry the team and Keith can carry my jock.

437
00:33:39,407 --> 00:33:42,347
- Keith, it’s good to see you man.
- You too, Bruce.

438
00:33:42,530 --> 00:33:44,989
I didn’t know you had a son that played ball too.

439
00:33:46,536 --> 00:33:47,995
Well, actually I’m just a stand-in.

440
00:33:48,823 --> 00:33:50,775
One of the boys doesn’t have a father.

441
00:33:58,436 --> 00:34:00,662
Luke! Lucas!

442
00:34:01,527 --> 00:34:03,027
Hey, Scott!

443
00:34:11,004 --> 00:34:12,520
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

444
00:34:12,627 --> 00:34:16,611
And welcome to the Tree Hill Ravens’ father and son charity basketball game.

445
00:34:16,816 --> 00:34:20,865
Tonight the fathers battle the sons and the winner gets bragging rights.

446
00:34:22,335 --> 00:34:27,419
Coming soon tonight, Ravens son league MVP Nathan Scott.

447
00:34:28,234 --> 00:34:31,777
And for the father’s, the all-time even scorer in the history of Tree Hill,

448
00:34:31,859 --> 00:34:37,362
and state championship runnerup, put your hands together for Dan Scott!

449
00:34:44,311 --> 00:34:46,655
Sounds like the old man got a louder applause than you did.

450
00:34:46,701 --> 00:34:48,457
Are you sure your hearing aid’s not turned up too loud?

451
00:35:14,185 --> 00:35:17,340
Under a minute remaining now and the Ravens’ sons are putting on a show.

452
00:35:17,483 --> 00:35:19,585
They’ve made a mockery out of this one.

453
00:35:19,623 --> 00:35:22,070
28 point lead and they’re running it in on the fathers…

454
00:35:25,684 --> 00:35:29,362
Lucas Scott spins the ball on his finger… over to Hamilton…

455
00:35:33,108 --> 00:35:38,312
- Hamilton disgraces his father.
- Don’t try that crap with me, Nate.

456
00:35:43,288 --> 00:35:47,291
Nathan Scott tries… scores and is left with an even 30 points at halftime.

457
00:35:50,706 --> 00:35:52,954
You guys suck out there. It’s embarrassing.

458
00:35:53,252 --> 00:35:54,244
For you, maybe.

459
00:35:54,992 --> 00:35:59,668
Come on… you play house with a girl I get pregnant in high school and I’m supposed to be embarrassed?

460
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:03,339
It’s embarrassing because we’re old men, Dan, playing horribly

461
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:06,052
- and that’s the way it’s supposed to be.
- Not for me.

462
00:36:11,991 --> 00:36:14,448
- Enemy approaching.
- That’s right, enemy approaching.

463
00:36:14,540 --> 00:36:15,979
Are you going to bring your best game or what?

464
00:36:16,686 --> 00:36:19,491
- You’re down by thirty, Dad.
- No, I’m talking to you.

465
00:36:19,852 --> 00:36:22,185
You bring your best game, I’ll bring mine, and then we’ll see.

466
00:36:22,864 --> 00:36:24,965
- We’ll see what?
- We’ll see who’s the best.

467
00:36:25,159 --> 00:36:26,727
Or maybe you’d rather not know.

468
00:36:27,325 --> 00:36:30,983
- Hey. Come on, relax, little brother.
- This isn’t your place, Keith.

469
00:36:31,206 --> 00:36:34,110
Well, it’s not your place either, Dan.

470
00:36:34,713 --> 00:36:37,945
It’s their game now. We should be proud they’re so good.

471
00:36:38,057 --> 00:36:39,864
Like you had anything to do with it.

472
00:36:43,403 --> 00:36:44,806
You walk away, Danny.

473
00:36:48,027 --> 00:36:49,239
Lets see what you got.

474
00:36:55,434 --> 00:36:57,385
Any of you give me your best game and...

475
00:36:58,394 --> 00:36:59,591
I’m gonna hurt you.

476
00:37:02,230 --> 00:37:03,682
Hey, you’re doing fine.

477
00:37:53,773 --> 00:37:59,614
- Lucas. Luke. Are you mad at me? What’s going on?
- I don’t want to talk about it right now.

478
00:37:59,891 --> 00:38:01,779
Okay, can you just tell me what I did, please?

479
00:38:02,252 --> 00:38:04,806
- I saw you with him.
- Who Nathan?

480
00:38:05,318 --> 00:38:08,528
God, he got a good grade on that math quiz. It was nothing.

481
00:38:08,857 --> 00:38:10,571
I want to believe you, Haley. I do.

482
00:38:11,313 --> 00:38:16,341
- But I don’t think you’re telling the truth.
- I’m am telling the truth Lucas. There’s nothing going on.

483
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:23,940
Nice bracelet.

484
00:38:28,123 --> 00:38:31,692
Well folks, an impressive showing for Dan Scott. The kids are just too much.

485
00:38:31,773 --> 00:38:33,381
What do you say we make this interesting?

486
00:38:33,607 --> 00:38:37,517
Lets make the score 0-0, and the next basket wins.

487
00:38:37,677 --> 00:38:38,828
Alright. Give me the ball.

488
00:38:39,068 --> 00:38:42,439
Alright. Lets go, fellas. Ravens on three. One, two, three! Ravens.

489
00:38:51,530 --> 00:38:54,343
The Ravens’ sons have the ball, and the next basket wins.

490
00:38:54,966 --> 00:38:55,945
Game over, Dad.

491
00:38:58,884 --> 00:39:03,149
Nathan Scott to the tape. He catches the ball in the wing. He rides to the- holy crap!

492
00:39:03,948 --> 00:39:05,643
Lets hope the young man’s okay.

493
00:39:12,451 --> 00:39:13,522
You okay?

494
00:39:15,318 --> 00:39:16,993
I couldn’t give you the winning bucket, Nathan.

495
00:39:26,537 --> 00:39:28,631
- Beat them?
- Yeah.

496
00:39:29,138 --> 00:39:30,684
But I want to do it myself.

497
00:39:32,313 --> 00:39:34,889
Well, good news, folks. Nathan seems to be okay.

498
00:39:34,990 --> 00:39:37,136
And the Ravens sons still have a crack at it…

499
00:39:38,574 --> 00:39:40,515
Lucas Scott hands the ball to Nathan.

500
00:39:41,934 --> 00:39:44,975
He drives- ooh! He drops the ball. It’s moving.

501
00:39:45,128 --> 00:39:48,399
That will create a turnover. The fathers have a crack at it.

502
00:39:48,758 --> 00:39:50,954
Looks like its payback time.

503
00:39:54,119 --> 00:39:55,998
That was a sloppy turnover, Nathan. That’s not like you.

504
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:58,773
- That’s because it was on purpose.
- On purpose? Why?

505
00:39:58,851 --> 00:40:00,498
Because you don’t deserve my best game, Dad.

506
00:40:01,180 --> 00:40:04,778
Look. I could’ve beat you. You know it and I know it.

507
00:40:04,856 --> 00:40:07,989
You know, if you want to mess with that, go ahead. I’ll give it to you.

508
00:40:22,592 --> 00:40:23,989
You didn’t beat me, Dad.

509
00:40:24,681 --> 00:40:25,908
You never will.

510
00:40:41,003 --> 00:40:41,726
Good game.

511
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:45,974
What? Are you kidding me? I was by far the worst one out there.

512
00:40:46,235 --> 00:40:48,918
And that includes old Mr. Budieres and his wooden leg.

513
00:40:50,055 --> 00:40:52,041
Oh, Keith, you know it’s never about basketball.

514
00:40:54,464 --> 00:40:55,637
And just so you know…

515
00:40:56,404 --> 00:40:57,633
what you did for Nathan,

516
00:40:58,898 --> 00:41:01,084
what you’ve done for me…

517
00:41:03,506 --> 00:41:06,588
well, lets just say I was proud to have you as my dad for the night.

518
00:41:09,619 --> 00:41:14,673
You know, I’ve been thinking about what you said about the Scott name, and...

519
00:41:16,212 --> 00:41:21,216
I think I’ll keep it. I just hope I can wear it as well as you.

520
00:41:22,148 --> 00:41:23,116
Thanks.

521
00:41:34,082 --> 00:41:34,819
Hey.

522
00:41:40,119 --> 00:41:41,102
I’m glad you came.

523
00:41:42,449 --> 00:41:43,342
I knew you would.

524
00:41:47,764 --> 00:41:49,766
I want you to know thing’s are going to be different for us.

525
00:41:50,492 --> 00:41:52,274
Did you know that my mom died tonight?

526
00:41:52,817 --> 00:41:54,260
Seven years ago?

527
00:41:57,196 --> 00:41:59,519
You didn’t know because you never asked.

528
00:42:01,966 --> 00:42:03,636
I didn’t come here for you tonight.

529
00:42:05,151 --> 00:42:06,349
Why’d you come?

530
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,848
John Steinbeck once wrote

531
00:42:42,001 --> 00:42:46,021
“It seems to me that if you or I must choose

532
00:42:46,075 --> 00:42:48,154
between two courses of thought or action,

533
00:42:49,572 --> 00:42:51,206
we should remember our dying

534
00:42:51,764 --> 00:42:53,182
and try so to live

535
00:42:54,737 --> 00:42:57,744
that our death brings no pleasure on the world."
