1
00:00:11,253 --> 00:00:12,051
What’s up man?

2
00:00:17,425 --> 00:00:18,228
Brooke?

3
00:00:29,870 --> 00:00:31,054
It’s called ‘Dare Night’.

4
00:00:31,377 --> 00:00:34,521
One night, two teams, multiple dares.

5
00:00:36,656 --> 00:00:38,755
Each envelope contains a two-part dare.

6
00:00:39,292 --> 00:00:41,852
Part one is on the front; part two is on the back.

7
00:00:41,925 --> 00:00:43,865
Each dare is worth a certain number of points.

8
00:00:44,116 --> 00:00:46,384
This cell phone has picture and video.

9
00:00:46,481 --> 00:00:47,244
Oh sweet!

10
00:00:48,017 --> 00:00:51,060
You do the dare; you send proof of it to the other team.

11
00:00:51,452 --> 00:00:53,127
At midnight, time’s up.

12
00:00:53,337 --> 00:00:54,846
We meet back here and declare the winner.

13
00:00:54,924 --> 00:00:55,917
And what do we win?

14
00:00:56,077 --> 00:00:58,334
You Mouth, win an excuse to be out till midnight.

15
00:00:58,472 --> 00:01:00,505
The rest of you, get a night to remember.

16
00:01:01,693 --> 00:01:03,660
And you get to humiliate us.

17
00:01:04,432 --> 00:01:05,654
Why would we do that?

18
00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:10,527
Look guys, there’s nothing in these envelopes that’s harmful to you or anyone else.

19
00:01:10,653 --> 00:01:13,275
It’s all about having fun, testing your limits.

20
00:01:13,423 --> 00:01:15,380
Every once in a while, you gotta wake yourself up.

21
00:01:16,167 --> 00:01:17,288
You wanna do it Nate?

22
00:01:18,149 --> 00:01:22,685
All anybody does in this town is brood and… pout, get married.

23
00:01:24,487 --> 00:01:25,424
I’ll play.

24
00:01:26,929 --> 00:01:29,832
Yeah, what the hell. I’m up for something daring.

25
00:01:32,894 --> 00:01:33,851
Who else is in?

26
00:01:46,958 --> 00:01:50,191
Come on! I wanna play. I didn’t get invited.

27
00:01:51,511 --> 00:01:56,186
Tell you what; you can play if… Brooke and Lucas play.

28
00:02:06,303 --> 00:02:08,940
- Pick the stupid teams. 
- Alright.

29
00:02:09,267 --> 00:02:13,917
Boys against the girls. You six guys against the three girls… plus me.

30
00:02:13,994 --> 00:02:15,166
I count as three anyway.

31
00:02:15,337 --> 00:02:16,845
Yeah, three girls!

32
00:02:19,723 --> 00:02:21,284
Sweet. Teams are set.

33
00:02:25,129 --> 00:02:27,265
- What’s this? 
- That my friend…

34
00:02:27,823 --> 00:02:29,446
is your first dare.

35
00:03:22,284 --> 00:03:24,849
Return these clothes to stores in the mall.

36
00:03:24,936 --> 00:03:25,879
What’s so hard about that?

37
00:03:28,357 --> 00:03:29,509
While wearing them.

38
00:03:34,435 --> 00:03:36,845
- Hello? 
- You guys ready to forfeit yet?

39
00:03:37,441 --> 00:03:41,408
You talk a big game little booty, but we about to light your ass; up.

40
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:42,304
Game on.

41
00:03:46,444 --> 00:03:48,457
Alright. Nate you got your picture phone?

42
00:03:48,539 --> 00:03:50,726
- Yeah. 
- Beautiful. Skills.

43
00:03:50,874 --> 00:03:51,837
I got one.

44
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:56,609
Alright boys, that game is to divide and conquer. Alright, I’ll catch up with you guys later.

45
00:03:56,834 --> 00:03:59,502
If not, we meet at the café at midnight.

46
00:04:00,152 --> 00:04:01,489
You really gonna do this dare?

47
00:04:02,605 --> 00:04:03,399
Yeah.

48
00:04:03,956 --> 00:04:06,440
You know why? Coz he doesn’t think I will.

49
00:04:06,532 --> 00:04:07,284
Strong.

50
00:04:09,101 --> 00:04:11,067
- Tim, you’re coming with me. 
- I’m in it to win it.

51
00:04:11,162 --> 00:04:12,948
Just say yes, Tim.

52
00:04:17,315 --> 00:04:20,622
- Damn, he is good. 
- But I’m better.

53
00:04:22,703 --> 00:04:23,960
Catch you guys later.

54
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,250
Let’s do this.

55
00:04:28,232 --> 00:04:30,386
Okay, hate to break up Charlie’s Angels but…

56
00:04:30,504 --> 00:04:33,105
you guys take the Cingular phone and do these.

57
00:04:33,734 --> 00:04:35,613
There’s nothing too crazy on there.

58
00:04:35,696 --> 00:04:37,273
Why do I have to go with you?

59
00:04:37,473 --> 00:04:40,551
Because this is your first dare.

60
00:04:44,752 --> 00:04:47,416
Please! I could do that in my sleep.

61
00:04:47,728 --> 00:04:50,298
Great! Prove it.

62
00:04:59,902 --> 00:05:01,235
A little to the left.

63
00:05:10,692 --> 00:05:12,115
You like ‘The Constantines’?

64
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,150
Sure.

65
00:05:14,275 --> 00:05:17,516
I mean as much as anyone can like a band they’ve never heard of.

66
00:05:21,746 --> 00:05:24,494
So… how’s it going? Um… is everything okay?

67
00:05:24,588 --> 00:05:29,067
You’ve stopped in for coffee every morning this week and well I enjoy seeing you

68
00:05:29,155 --> 00:05:31,643
it’s just, well I’m not sure it’s appropriate.

69
00:05:31,715 --> 00:05:33,916
Well you know, in some cultures ah, you can buy coffee

70
00:05:33,977 --> 00:05:36,952
without actually having to have sex with the café owner.

71
00:05:37,085 --> 00:05:40,429
Um, you know, those cultures aren’t nearly as much fun for me but what you gonna do?

72
00:05:41,469 --> 00:05:44,370
I have... I’ve jumped to conclusions.

73
00:05:46,563 --> 00:05:48,165
I’m sorry.

74
00:05:48,908 --> 00:05:51,743
Um… forget that I came by.

75
00:05:52,431 --> 00:05:54,688
- Absolutely. Won’t mention it again. 
- Thank you.

76
00:05:54,811 --> 00:05:56,454
As long as you have dinner with me.

77
00:06:09,426 --> 00:06:11,507
I’d like to return this shirt.

78
00:06:14,505 --> 00:06:17,400
Oh, I happen to have the receipt. Here it is, yeah.

79
00:06:24,032 --> 00:06:26,075
Can I ask you why you’d like to return it?

80
00:06:26,233 --> 00:06:29,638
Um… wrong size?

81
00:06:31,733 --> 00:06:33,514
Can’t we get you another size?

82
00:06:33,595 --> 00:06:35,290
No, thanks, no I’m good.

83
00:06:36,294 --> 00:06:37,073
I’m good.

84
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:40,630
Oh um… excuse me?

85
00:06:41,102 --> 00:06:43,226
Would you mind taking a picture?

86
00:06:43,963 --> 00:06:44,782
Thank you.

87
00:06:48,157 --> 00:06:49,294
Smile!

88
00:06:52,171 --> 00:06:55,647
Hi, can we have five pickled eggs please?

89
00:06:55,914 --> 00:06:58,427
So I had an idea, why don’t we just get a picture of you eating one egg

90
00:06:58,468 --> 00:07:00,041
and then tell them you ate five.

91
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:02,724
Haley James-Scott, we don’t cheat.

92
00:07:02,825 --> 00:07:04,257
Well you did with Lucas.

93
00:07:04,325 --> 00:07:06,031
Don’t make me smack you!

94
00:07:07,058 --> 00:07:08,023
Here!

95
00:07:08,542 --> 00:07:09,456
Thank you.

96
00:07:09,686 --> 00:07:11,848
- Alright, are we doing this now? 
- Here we go!

97
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:14,325
Do it, do it. Go go go.

98
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:20,107
Four and a half more to go!

99
00:07:23,148 --> 00:07:24,929
Oh, make the five.

100
00:07:25,325 --> 00:07:28,554
Mmmm. Not cheating tastes good.

101
00:07:28,763 --> 00:07:30,801
Get that away from me you crazy...

102
00:07:44,316 --> 00:07:47,190
Well this is it. Massage and Spa.

103
00:07:50,222 --> 00:07:51,691
What’s the back say?

104
00:07:53,790 --> 00:07:55,230
Ask for the special.

105
00:07:58,306 --> 00:07:59,783
It’s the Happy Ending.

106
00:08:03,489 --> 00:08:06,888
Okay, so all I have to do is get a table?

107
00:08:07,062 --> 00:08:09,948
With no waiting. It’s the hottest restaurant in town.

108
00:08:10,027 --> 00:08:13,589
If you insist on wasting my time, at least come up with better dares.

109
00:08:14,967 --> 00:08:17,160
- Hi, I was wondering...
- Name?

110
00:08:18,459 --> 00:08:20,568
- Brooke Davis. 
- No.

111
00:08:21,566 --> 00:08:23,308
You didn’t even check your list.

112
00:08:24,658 --> 00:08:26,246
Perhaps there’s another name.

113
00:08:26,359 --> 00:08:27,777
- Angelina Jolie. 
- No.

114
00:08:27,855 --> 00:08:29,068
- The Queen of Sheeba. 
- No.

115
00:08:29,149 --> 00:08:30,536
- The Queen of Hearts. 
- No.

116
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:33,179
- How about Queen Latifah? 
- I’m afraid not.

117
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:42,420
Table for two. Right this way sir.

118
00:08:46,844 --> 00:08:47,957
How did you do that?

119
00:08:48,023 --> 00:08:49,968
I made a reservation for two last week.

120
00:08:53,808 --> 00:08:55,281
Come on team mate.

121
00:09:01,851 --> 00:09:03,423
Can I… help you?

122
00:09:04,187 --> 00:09:06,669
Forty-one thousand four hundred and sixty seven dollars.

123
00:09:06,833 --> 00:09:07,668
Okay…

124
00:09:07,744 --> 00:09:09,941
I know exactly what the dealer invoice on this car is.

125
00:09:10,028 --> 00:09:15,849
MSRP, tax, freight. I don’t wanna haggle over scotch or… floor mats or anything.

126
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:18,460
Take it or leave it.

127
00:09:18,548 --> 00:09:20,678
- And you’re sure you want this car? 
- Absolutely.

128
00:09:20,795 --> 00:09:24,840
Hmm. Well maybe you wanna test-drive it before you over-pay me.

129
00:09:42,235 --> 00:09:45,499
Cameras, are you seeing this?

130
00:09:54,413 --> 00:09:57,323
It says we have to get a hit on the fastest pitching machine.

131
00:09:57,460 --> 00:09:59,000
Oh man, this all good, back up.

132
00:09:59,538 --> 00:10:00,864
Using your head.

133
00:10:02,478 --> 00:10:05,586
Well come on man, get in there. We aint got all day. Let’s go.

134
00:10:05,714 --> 00:10:10,004
So what, you can’t get a date. Move to new towns and trick people into eating with you?

135
00:10:10,454 --> 00:10:13,434
Wow, you totally exposed me.

136
00:10:13,624 --> 00:10:15,406
Seriously, I mean mostly naked here.

137
00:10:19,358 --> 00:10:21,560
How bout you? What’s your story?

138
00:10:22,155 --> 00:10:23,844
Bored and ignored.

139
00:10:25,078 --> 00:10:29,296
Bored maybe… but you never been ignored by a guy in your life.

140
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:31,395
I meant at home, genius.

141
00:10:31,871 --> 00:10:38,169
Guys are easy. They usually fall for me over the first… pathetic… little… dinner.

142
00:10:38,512 --> 00:10:39,367
Yeah?

143
00:10:39,984 --> 00:10:45,138
What do they fall for first? The shoplifting or the eating disorder?

144
00:10:48,312 --> 00:10:49,407
Excuse me!

145
00:10:50,058 --> 00:10:54,292
Hi. Just curious; what’s your most expensive entrée?

146
00:10:55,162 --> 00:10:56,130
Well, we have...

147
00:10:56,224 --> 00:11:00,555
Sounds great. I’ll take two. I’m really hungry.

148
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:06,986
Nicely played. I’ll be right back.

149
00:11:13,173 --> 00:11:16,672
Okay! Full body treatment.

150
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:20,282
The special. We want the special.

151
00:11:20,875 --> 00:11:22,227
What exactly is the special?

152
00:11:22,324 --> 00:11:26,308
Oh the special is very nice.

153
00:11:26,836 --> 00:11:28,709
- Who’s first? 
- Me.

154
00:11:30,243 --> 00:11:35,255
Okay. I’ll just peel back your sheet.

155
00:11:35,324 --> 00:11:36,369
Oh yeah!

156
00:11:36,461 --> 00:11:39,140
So this is legitimate right? This is… like a massage?

157
00:11:39,213 --> 00:11:40,487
Dude, shut up!

158
00:11:41,075 --> 00:11:42,919
I am concentrating.

159
00:11:43,281 --> 00:11:46,462
Yeah, you know what, I really don’t think I need to be here for this.

160
00:11:46,610 --> 00:11:49,287
Oh… it won’t take long.

161
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,583
Yeah, I’ll bet.

162
00:11:51,131 --> 00:11:57,096
Okay, one special! Full… body… wax!

163
00:11:58,520 --> 00:11:59,339
I’m out!

164
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:05,101
Come on Mouth, toughen up dawg!

165
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,161
- It’s gonna hurt! 
- So what? Be a warrior.

166
00:12:07,346 --> 00:12:10,090
- Yeah, take one for the team Mouth. 
- But what about you guys?

167
00:12:10,156 --> 00:12:12,184
- Man, I’m takin the pictures. 
- I’m helpin him.

168
00:12:17,171 --> 00:12:20,311
Dang! Man I missed that one. You gonna have to do it again.

169
00:12:20,469 --> 00:12:21,801
Come on, back on the plate.

170
00:12:23,473 --> 00:12:26,332
Uh… I need to return some pants.

171
00:12:26,541 --> 00:12:29,028
Okay... do you have them?

172
00:12:38,842 --> 00:12:39,777
Hello?

173
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,660
You know, you shouldn’t be answering my phone.

174
00:12:41,737 --> 00:12:42,843
Where the hell are you?

175
00:12:43,032 --> 00:12:44,123
I’m at the café.

176
00:12:45,826 --> 00:12:46,755
What?

177
00:12:46,847 --> 00:12:49,218
Flip the dare card over, and read it.

178
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:55,813
You did not just leave me here!

179
00:12:59,837 --> 00:13:03,098
Look, I don’t have the money to pay for this and I am not walking out on the cheque!

180
00:13:03,171 --> 00:13:05,608
Why not? I’ve seen you steal before.

181
00:13:06,039 --> 00:13:08,294
Besides, I dare ya.

182
00:13:23,333 --> 00:13:25,892
Okay. Just stay put son.

183
00:13:28,448 --> 00:13:30,552
Follow me! Hurry up!

184
00:13:47,097 --> 00:13:49,568
Excuse me Miss! Your bill!

185
00:13:52,108 --> 00:13:53,316
My car’s outside!

186
00:13:56,224 --> 00:13:57,315
Trust me.

187
00:14:12,475 --> 00:14:14,798
Ha, mission accomplished.

188
00:14:16,115 --> 00:14:17,309
You want the locker key back?

189
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,088
No thanks! Look, I’m sorry about all of this.

190
00:14:20,273 --> 00:14:23,217
I… just… dare night thing.

191
00:14:23,754 --> 00:14:25,050
Just didn’t wanna back down.

192
00:14:25,142 --> 00:14:29,447
Oh yeah. I saw you earlier and I figured it was something like that.

193
00:14:30,427 --> 00:14:33,191
I didn’t want you to get busted for just having a little fun.

194
00:14:34,138 --> 00:14:35,003
Thank you.

195
00:14:36,283 --> 00:14:38,300
- So what’s your name? 
- Anna.

196
00:14:38,403 --> 00:14:40,815
I’m Lucas. You from Tree Hill?

197
00:14:40,917 --> 00:14:43,974
Yeah, but… we… wouldn’t have met.

198
00:14:44,081 --> 00:14:44,890
Why not?

199
00:14:45,111 --> 00:14:48,771
Oh, I tend not to roll with guys in bras and leather pants.

200
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:50,730
You’re funny.

201
00:14:57,851 --> 00:15:02,364
Oh sorry. Anyway, I owe you one.

202
00:15:03,287 --> 00:15:07,628
Well… how bout you pay me back by letting me play too.

203
00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:10,464
Okay.

204
00:15:11,181 --> 00:15:13,106
So? What’s next?

205
00:15:13,352 --> 00:15:18,201
Um… I don’t know. Lets find out.

206
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:22,015
Sell a box of cookies.

207
00:15:22,614 --> 00:15:27,345
Great. I get my crack waxed and you get… cookies.

208
00:15:28,661 --> 00:15:30,608
Felix left this for you.

209
00:15:35,932 --> 00:15:38,129
You know, I really don’t like this Felix kid.

210
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:44,349
Good evening Mr and Mrs Tree Hill resident.

211
00:15:44,405 --> 00:15:47,401
We’re selling these delicious cookies to raise money for ‘Lady Leprechauns’.

212
00:15:49,843 --> 00:15:56,263
An organisation that empowers us girls to be strong, beautiful, independent women of tomorrow.

213
00:15:57,308 --> 00:16:01,112
Screw this dare night crap! Can’t believe I’m wearing a skirt!

214
00:16:01,414 --> 00:16:02,658
Yeah, in public.

215
00:16:05,073 --> 00:16:08,756
When we get back to the café, I’m gonna beat on that kid. Felix!

216
00:16:08,813 --> 00:16:09,975
I think he’s kinda cool.

217
00:16:10,149 --> 00:16:11,039
You would.

218
00:16:11,890 --> 00:16:15,105
I’m just saying. One week it’s Lucas, now it’s Felix.

219
00:16:15,561 --> 00:16:17,245
Just tell me who we’re hatin on next week

220
00:16:17,302 --> 00:16:19,140
Nate coz… I’m kinda having trouble keeping up.

221
00:16:19,196 --> 00:16:23,149
Yeah well you wouldn’t have that problem if you got a life of your own and quit living mine.

222
00:16:27,572 --> 00:16:28,525
Whatever!

223
00:16:31,219 --> 00:16:33,932
Tim, I didn’t mean that. Wait up man.

224
00:16:35,027 --> 00:16:35,929
Come on!

225
00:16:39,875 --> 00:16:42,021
So, um… where was I?

226
00:16:42,083 --> 00:16:44,259
You’re trying to force me to get the CD changer!

227
00:16:44,335 --> 00:16:47,462
I wasn’t forcing you. It’s just an option I thought you might like.

228
00:16:48,857 --> 00:16:54,626
There’s um… also the leather interior, the… optional touring package…

229
00:16:54,755 --> 00:16:59,434
and option to pause at stop signs!

230
00:17:04,938 --> 00:17:07,380
Okay, that wasn’t my fault. The thing just jumped out at me.

231
00:17:07,468 --> 00:17:09,608
- The stop sign? 
- It practically pounced!

232
00:17:10,264 --> 00:17:13,924
Okay! Um… I think maybe I should drive us back.

233
00:17:14,051 --> 00:17:15,234
No, I’ll be fine.

234
00:17:15,864 --> 00:17:17,585
I just get a little nervous.

235
00:17:17,851 --> 00:17:20,662
I only have so much money and this is a big decision for me.

236
00:17:20,883 --> 00:17:23,714
Besides, car sales men are always such jerks.

237
00:17:24,769 --> 00:17:26,519
Why are you smiling at me?

238
00:17:26,649 --> 00:17:31,492
My brother owns the dealership, I’m just helping out. I’m actually a mechanic.

239
00:17:32,238 --> 00:17:35,909
Oh. I like mechanics.

240
00:17:41,916 --> 00:17:44,282
Oh, you are such a jerk!

241
00:17:44,368 --> 00:17:45,802
Come on, it was just a dare.

242
00:17:45,976 --> 00:17:48,567
You got us big points for that one. Lock it up!

243
00:17:50,722 --> 00:17:52,258
You should be locked up!

244
00:17:52,443 --> 00:17:54,116
Brooke, I’m sorry! Don’t go.

245
00:17:55,438 --> 00:17:57,905
It was just part of the game. I promise.

246
00:18:00,327 --> 00:18:02,344
I didn’t know you’d be so upset. Okay?

247
00:18:04,305 --> 00:18:05,687
How bout you read the next one?

248
00:18:10,567 --> 00:18:12,856
Go to the cemetery. Hm!

249
00:18:13,430 --> 00:18:16,906
And take a photo in an open grave! That’s perfect.

250
00:18:16,998 --> 00:18:19,584
Since I plane on killing you, anyway!

251
00:18:20,609 --> 00:18:22,368
I think we get bonus points for that.

252
00:18:22,568 --> 00:18:23,361
Great!

253
00:18:26,136 --> 00:18:29,010
- Hey yo, Fergie, what’s the next dare? 
- Karaoke.

254
00:18:29,434 --> 00:18:33,229
- Mouth! 
- I like big butts and I can not lie,

255
00:18:33,323 --> 00:18:37,065
You other brothers can’t deny, 
When a girls walks in with an itty bitty waist

256
00:18:37,130 --> 00:18:39,895
And a round thing in your face 
You get sprung!

257
00:18:39,961 --> 00:18:42,695
Wanna pull up front 
Cuz you notice that butt was stuffed

258
00:18:44,108 --> 00:18:47,779
Okay, I got three dollars and… eighty cents!

259
00:18:48,554 --> 00:18:49,917
Alright, we need five dollars.

260
00:18:50,502 --> 00:18:51,748
Oh, a quarter!

261
00:18:51,955 --> 00:18:52,782
Fellas

262
00:18:53,043 --> 00:18:53,693
Fellas

263
00:18:53,882 --> 00:18:55,076
Has your girlfriend got the butt?

264
00:18:55,427 --> 00:18:56,448
Well shake it,

265
00:18:56,632 --> 00:18:57,406
Shake it,

266
00:18:57,585 --> 00:19:00,293
Shake that healthy butt 
Baby got back

267
00:19:10,118 --> 00:19:12,284
Okay, hold on a second.

268
00:19:13,953 --> 00:19:18,244
Oh, oh my gosh! Are you okay? It look... Oh! Ooh.

269
00:19:24,956 --> 00:19:27,022
So ladies 
Ladies

270
00:19:27,119 --> 00:19:28,945
If you wanna role in my Mercedes

271
00:19:29,017 --> 00:19:30,707
Then turn around 
Stick it out

272
00:19:30,788 --> 00:19:33,454
Even white boys got to shout 
Baby got back!

273
00:19:38,431 --> 00:19:40,291
Baby got back.

274
00:19:49,245 --> 00:19:50,598
So this is dinner.

275
00:19:50,675 --> 00:19:52,733
I want you to have anything you want. I’m rich you know.

276
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:54,510
Well I’m getting chilli on mine!

277
00:19:54,878 --> 00:19:55,524
Thank you.

278
00:19:55,877 --> 00:19:56,599
Thank you.

279
00:19:57,479 --> 00:20:01,939
So… I know that my class is obviously the highlight of your week but what else do you like to do?

280
00:20:02,205 --> 00:20:06,521
Mostly school and the café and my son.

281
00:20:07,132 --> 00:20:08,759
You have a son? Nice.

282
00:20:08,831 --> 00:20:09,500
Yeah.

283
00:20:10,142 --> 00:20:11,345
Well he’s got a tough mom.

284
00:20:12,189 --> 00:20:14,883
I think it’s so great that you went back to school in your late twenties you know.

285
00:20:15,793 --> 00:20:16,684
Early thirties?

286
00:20:18,117 --> 00:20:19,240
My god, how old are you?

287
00:20:19,337 --> 00:20:22,460
Old enough to have never heard of that band, ‘The Constantines’.

288
00:20:22,541 --> 00:20:24,251
Ah, but you see, now you’re one of the hip kids.

289
00:20:24,446 --> 00:20:25,152
Hardly.

290
00:20:25,716 --> 00:20:30,887
So I was thinking about what you said last week; about challenging yourself, moving forward.

291
00:20:31,409 --> 00:20:34,585
Well I had a plan that I would open another business here in Tree Hill

292
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:39,070
and I discussed it with my business partner and… we decided to take the plunge.

293
00:20:39,213 --> 00:20:39,936
Can I invest?

294
00:20:40,346 --> 00:20:41,133
No!

295
00:20:43,038 --> 00:20:44,983
But what would you say to some ice-cream?

296
00:20:45,767 --> 00:20:47,682
Oh it’s fine but I’m not really made of money, Karen.

297
00:20:48,337 --> 00:20:49,505
My treat.

298
00:20:50,698 --> 00:20:54,356
Well I love ice-cream but… if you bought me ice-cream, you know, does this mean that…

299
00:20:54,438 --> 00:20:57,333
You know, there are some cultures where you can actually have ice-cream-

300
00:20:57,415 --> 00:20:58,563
- Yeah, I get it.
- Yeah.

301
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:05,936
How much do I owe you for the pizza?

302
00:21:06,509 --> 00:21:07,281
Nothing.

303
00:21:08,219 --> 00:21:10,113
I took a little extra from the fountain.

304
00:21:14,214 --> 00:21:16,282
This is… weird. Isn’t it?

305
00:21:17,081 --> 00:21:20,578
Oh I mean, people don’t just meet and hang out like this.

306
00:21:20,716 --> 00:21:21,884
Unless it’s a hook-up.

307
00:21:22,423 --> 00:21:25,114
- And it’s not?
- I didn’t think it was.

308
00:21:25,759 --> 00:21:28,253
Besides, not doing that anymore.

309
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:29,702
Anymore?

310
00:21:32,421 --> 00:21:35,329
Long story. Trust me.

311
00:21:38,257 --> 00:21:40,782
Do you think two people can get to know each other…

312
00:21:40,854 --> 00:21:43,430
without ever going into their long stories?

313
00:21:44,606 --> 00:21:45,416
Sure.

314
00:21:46,219 --> 00:21:49,264
But isn’t who you were a part of who you are?

315
00:21:50,521 --> 00:21:51,581
Maybe,

316
00:21:52,472 --> 00:21:56,526
but I guess I’m saying that; I don’t really need to know the person that you used to be.

317
00:21:56,998 --> 00:22:00,725
As much… as the person that you’re trying to be.

318
00:22:02,649 --> 00:22:03,429
Yeah…

319
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:04,995
me too.

320
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:10,504
- You ready for our next dare?
- Oh, yeah.

321
00:22:13,438 --> 00:22:14,431
Do the honours.

322
00:22:19,454 --> 00:22:23,648
Take a photo, with a stranger… in a photo booth.

323
00:22:28,588 --> 00:22:29,428
Come on.

324
00:22:37,504 --> 00:22:40,524
So. I have a confession to make.

325
00:22:41,275 --> 00:22:45,500
The card doesn’t say take a photo with a stranger in a photo booth.

326
00:22:47,328 --> 00:22:48,096
No?

327
00:22:50,022 --> 00:22:54,507
No. It says… make out with a stranger in a photo booth.

328
00:22:56,539 --> 00:22:57,941
Ah, here’s the thing...

329
00:22:58,668 --> 00:23:03,185
Look, it’s just a dare, right? I mean… it’s no big deal.

330
00:23:08,575 --> 00:23:09,815
There’s a part two right?

331
00:23:10,343 --> 00:23:13,021
Ah; bonus points.

332
00:23:14,761 --> 00:23:16,599
You’re gonna have to get out for this one.

333
00:23:22,697 --> 00:23:24,576
Mm, enjoy.

334
00:23:32,464 --> 00:23:34,253
Okay! What’s next?

335
00:23:34,330 --> 00:23:35,522
You gonna tell what it was?

336
00:23:38,564 --> 00:23:39,517
Maybe!

337
00:23:44,401 --> 00:23:48,670
Okay, so I’m kinda thinking that… maybe we don’t really need these points so much.

338
00:23:49,105 --> 00:23:53,100
- Come on! I’ll protect you. 
- Yeah, that’s exactly what I’m counting on.

339
00:23:53,176 --> 00:23:54,615
Well maybe you prefer Lucas.

340
00:23:55,690 --> 00:23:57,257
What did Mouth tell you?!

341
00:23:57,400 --> 00:24:01,000
Nothing. We move around a lot, school cliques are easy to read;

342
00:24:01,106 --> 00:24:02,827
who rolls with who, that kinda thing.

343
00:24:03,305 --> 00:24:05,158
You and Lucas obviously had something.

344
00:24:05,756 --> 00:24:07,175
Yeah we had something.

345
00:24:08,931 --> 00:24:12,710
We had something fake and painful that I’m not gonna discuss

346
00:24:12,772 --> 00:24:14,763
with you and a bunch of dead people.

347
00:24:16,036 --> 00:24:20,205
What about you anyway? I can’t imagine anyone would actually date you.

348
00:24:20,272 --> 00:24:24,163
The question is; why would I date them? When I could just hook up with them instead.

349
00:24:24,665 --> 00:24:26,384
You know, friends with benefits.

350
00:24:26,691 --> 00:24:28,011
No strings attached.

351
00:24:28,074 --> 00:24:31,723
I don’t think that works. Somebody always ends up getting hurt.

352
00:24:31,863 --> 00:24:33,553
Not if you’re upfront about it.

353
00:24:33,855 --> 00:24:37,080
Think about it; you had sex this year, and so did I...

354
00:24:38,248 --> 00:24:41,572
but I didn’t end up in a cemetery talking about how painful it was.

355
00:24:43,062 --> 00:24:44,050
Oh perfect!

356
00:24:45,990 --> 00:24:47,117
This one will do.

357
00:24:48,858 --> 00:24:49,907
In you go.

358
00:24:50,413 --> 00:24:53,828
Oh no! You haven’t done anything tonight. Why do I have to go?

359
00:24:53,906 --> 00:24:55,289
I gotta work the camera phone.

360
00:24:55,985 --> 00:24:57,828
Besides, you wouldn’t be able to pull me out.

361
00:25:02,078 --> 00:25:03,899
I really don’t like you.

362
00:25:06,571 --> 00:25:07,458
Okay.

363
00:25:09,394 --> 00:25:10,197
Be careful.

364
00:25:19,533 --> 00:25:22,409
Okay. See you later.

365
00:25:22,482 --> 00:25:24,165
Felix, don't you dare leave me here!

366
00:25:27,135 --> 00:25:28,564
I’m just playing.

367
00:25:29,388 --> 00:25:31,201
Hold on. Let me get a picture.

368
00:25:38,662 --> 00:25:39,443
What’re you doing!?

369
00:26:03,602 --> 00:26:04,788
Stop it!

370
00:26:13,038 --> 00:26:15,617
Yo man, this dare is totally screwed up, dawg.

371
00:26:15,816 --> 00:26:17,916
Borrow a wild animal for the zoo?

372
00:26:18,126 --> 00:26:20,727
It’s like that movie where they try to steal the cougar but…

373
00:26:20,804 --> 00:26:23,262
- But what?
- Cougar ate their ass didn’t it?

374
00:26:24,131 --> 00:26:24,951
Sort of.

375
00:26:27,032 --> 00:26:30,070
Mouth man, I said a bird man. We in a damn snake house!

376
00:26:30,158 --> 00:26:31,975
Man, I’m not stealin no snake, dawg.

377
00:26:32,073 --> 00:26:35,586
Nothing with teeth, fangs or claws. Man forget it!

378
00:26:47,891 --> 00:26:49,700
I guess we could try for a fish.

379
00:26:49,839 --> 00:26:52,047
Uh-uh. Too slimy.

380
00:26:54,125 --> 00:26:57,725
Look, I got a problem with animals okay? I’ve never had a pet.

381
00:26:57,826 --> 00:27:01,436
I bet you Felix knows that too. I mean that dude is psychotic.

382
00:27:01,544 --> 00:27:03,485
- Psychic.
- Yeah, dat too.

383
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:17,263
Okay, I think they’re gone. Gimme a boost.

384
00:27:17,749 --> 00:27:19,581
Are you kidding? Your shoes are muddy.

385
00:27:19,935 --> 00:27:22,801
It’s either you give me a boost or be buried alive girly girl.

386
00:27:24,183 --> 00:27:24,947
Fine!

387
00:27:33,712 --> 00:27:36,023
Okay. Get me out.

388
00:27:42,914 --> 00:27:47,162
Stupid dare night. Where did you come up with this ridiculousness anyway?

389
00:27:47,532 --> 00:27:48,889
I mean, what is the point!?

390
00:27:49,196 --> 00:27:50,111
The point is simple;

391
00:27:51,029 --> 00:27:54,219
see how far you’ll go. You face your fears.

392
00:27:54,429 --> 00:27:58,284
And sometimes you’ll do things you wanna do because calling it a dare makes it okay for a night.

393
00:27:58,350 --> 00:27:59,563
Things like what?

394
00:28:01,302 --> 00:28:02,703
Like spending time with me.

395
00:28:12,370 --> 00:28:17,039
So we never really talked about the wedding. Like… how you got there.

396
00:28:17,126 --> 00:28:20,603
I told you; I got dressed, I… threw up at my parent’s house,

397
00:28:20,669 --> 00:28:23,132
brushed, flossed and… went to the beach.

398
00:28:23,228 --> 00:28:26,982
Okay, hard image to forget. But, I meant more like...

399
00:28:27,125 --> 00:28:31,523
I don’t know; how your heart got there. Marriage is big.

400
00:28:31,616 --> 00:28:33,336
I don’t know how you trust somebody for your whole life.

401
00:28:33,387 --> 00:28:36,352
I can’t even… date somebody with that escape hatch.

402
00:28:37,816 --> 00:28:41,451
I don’t know if it was so much about trusting Nathan - which I do - it was…

403
00:28:41,830 --> 00:28:43,408
more about trusting myself.

404
00:28:44,042 --> 00:28:46,811
Yeah, my old friend; self doubt.

405
00:28:47,395 --> 00:28:50,791
I dunno, sometimes everything seem… really simple

406
00:28:51,038 --> 00:28:52,359
- and then... 
- It’s not?

407
00:28:53,243 --> 00:28:54,079
Yeah.

408
00:28:57,304 --> 00:28:59,411
Alright, so what does this card say again?

409
00:28:59,484 --> 00:29:02,127
We’re supposed to… go to the confessional and read whatever’s on the card

410
00:29:02,214 --> 00:29:04,779
except you’re not supposed to read it until we get in there.

411
00:29:04,870 --> 00:29:07,602
Right, right, right. So… okay, so here’s the deal;

412
00:29:08,046 --> 00:29:10,391
I’m actually trying to avoid eternal damnation…

413
00:29:10,929 --> 00:29:13,212
so… I’m gonna pass.

414
00:29:13,811 --> 00:29:16,079
Alright. Give it.

415
00:29:33,562 --> 00:29:36,037
Bless me father for I have sinned.

416
00:29:37,507 --> 00:29:40,988
You see, lately I’ve been having impure thoughts about…

417
00:29:45,592 --> 00:29:49,665
Um… actually, I haven’t been doing very well lately.

418
00:29:50,599 --> 00:29:54,336
This is… the first time I’ve been in a church since my mom died.

419
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:01,587
I think about her every day!

420
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:10,143
I just… I wonder what she would say to me right now if she could see me

421
00:30:10,808 --> 00:30:12,938
and see how I’ve been living.

422
00:30:14,453 --> 00:30:16,454
And I wonder if she knows

423
00:30:17,797 --> 00:30:23,060
and most days, I fall short of being the person that she wanted me to be.

424
00:30:25,297 --> 00:30:26,214
Or…

425
00:30:29,507 --> 00:30:33,530
I wonder if she saw me do that line of coke last week!

426
00:30:36,853 --> 00:30:41,170
And the thing is… I don’t even know why I did it.

427
00:30:42,594 --> 00:30:46,342
You know, my life is pretty good, it is.

428
00:30:49,479 --> 00:30:53,155
But… I was just searching for something to make it great.

429
00:30:54,939 --> 00:30:59,462
Something to make it matter so…

430
00:31:01,056 --> 00:31:04,901
I don’t know, I guess last week when I had the chance to change that

431
00:31:05,884 --> 00:31:09,131
and it was… it was right there in front of me,

432
00:31:10,713 --> 00:31:13,205
I guess I was just scared to let that go.

433
00:31:15,646 --> 00:31:17,573
But I know it was wrong.

434
00:31:19,186 --> 00:31:21,688
And I want my mom to know that and…

435
00:31:24,051 --> 00:31:26,574
I want her to know that I am not that person.

436
00:31:28,166 --> 00:31:29,671
And I’m not going to be.

437
00:31:32,014 --> 00:31:33,578
I’m sure she knows.

438
00:31:40,039 --> 00:31:41,049
Tim, wait up!

439
00:31:41,204 --> 00:31:43,654
I said I was sorry. I didn’t mean to tear you down!

440
00:31:43,732 --> 00:31:44,693
Then why did you?

441
00:31:45,135 --> 00:31:47,726
Because I was pissed at Felix alright? And you were defending him.

442
00:31:47,770 --> 00:31:50,516
- I just don’t like him flirting with Haley.
- It’s always about Haley.

443
00:31:50,588 --> 00:31:54,442
No it’s not always about her. Tim, what do you want me to say? She’s my wife now.

444
00:31:56,056 --> 00:32:00,228
You know, we used to be tight! It was always you and me.

445
00:32:00,541 --> 00:32:03,203
Now you’re constantly with Haley or Lucas,

446
00:32:03,271 --> 00:32:05,435
and there’s never any time for us to hang out.

447
00:32:06,649 --> 00:32:08,625
Don’t you miss your ‘Tim Time’?

448
00:32:09,993 --> 00:32:12,635
Do I miss hanging out with you? Yes.

449
00:32:13,096 --> 00:32:16,255
Do I miss you saying things like ‘Tim Time’? No.

450
00:32:16,982 --> 00:32:22,559
Look, Tim, I know a lot of things have changed but us being friends isn’t one of them.

451
00:32:23,648 --> 00:32:27,351
We’ve been boys a long time now. I wouldn’t trade that for anything.

452
00:32:29,014 --> 00:32:31,568
Especially now that everything’s so crazy. Alright?

453
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:36,663
- Can we at least finish ‘Dare Night’?
- Yeah absolutely.

454
00:32:36,816 --> 00:32:39,360
Good. Coz this next one’s great.

455
00:32:44,901 --> 00:32:48,517
Well I’d, uh, point out the safety features but I think that fact that...

456
00:32:48,715 --> 00:32:50,877
you know, we got back in one piece speaks for itself.

457
00:32:53,006 --> 00:32:55,377
Look Jules; you picked a good car.

458
00:32:55,505 --> 00:33:00,522
But… the price you offered me was a grand too high and I couldn’t take a penny more.

459
00:33:00,666 --> 00:33:03,889
- Is this some new car selling trick?
- How would I know? I’m just a mechanic.

460
00:33:05,105 --> 00:33:06,876
How bout if I think about it?

461
00:33:07,222 --> 00:33:09,595
Was my counter offer too low?

462
00:33:09,707 --> 00:33:13,937
No, I just figured that if I wait a few days, then you’ll have to call me.

463
00:33:14,908 --> 00:33:15,996
You have my number.

464
00:33:23,386 --> 00:33:24,828
Eternal damnation for you?

465
00:33:26,067 --> 00:33:28,616
I think jury’s still out on that one.

466
00:33:29,114 --> 00:33:30,133
Are you okay?

467
00:33:31,263 --> 00:33:31,938
Yeah.

468
00:33:34,009 --> 00:33:36,071
Thanks for hanging out with me tonight Haley.

469
00:33:36,924 --> 00:33:38,462
You’re a good friend.

470
00:33:41,832 --> 00:33:42,624
Thanks.

471
00:33:45,508 --> 00:33:46,566
This was fun.

472
00:33:47,194 --> 00:33:49,962
I’m glad we did this. I needed a night like ‘Dare Night’.

473
00:33:50,499 --> 00:33:51,917
Yeah, me too.

474
00:33:59,956 --> 00:34:02,244
Steal the Tiki God from the second hole right?

475
00:34:02,494 --> 00:34:03,821
Here, check out part two.

476
00:34:07,149 --> 00:34:09,991
Get it? Dude, the hole’s number two!

477
00:34:12,116 --> 00:34:14,415
There is something wrong with you. You know that right?

478
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:17,205
What? I didn’t write the dare card.

479
00:34:18,298 --> 00:34:20,585
Dude, hand me the camera and give me some leaves alright?

480
00:34:23,706 --> 00:34:24,788
Thanks for hanging out tonight.

481
00:34:25,430 --> 00:34:26,263
Well thank you.

482
00:34:29,494 --> 00:34:31,346
Well… I better get going.

483
00:34:31,634 --> 00:34:34,981
I’ve got a business class in the morning and my teacher is a tyrant.

484
00:34:35,090 --> 00:34:36,339
Yeah, I heard about that guy.

485
00:34:38,572 --> 00:34:39,273
Karen,

486
00:34:41,996 --> 00:34:44,382
I think you’re doing a great thing; going after you new club.

487
00:34:45,770 --> 00:34:50,695
It’s a ‘Loosen up your collar’, ‘Run like a river’, ‘Glow like a beacon fire’.

488
00:34:51,730 --> 00:34:54,285
- Constantines?
- Oh, see how cool you are?

489
00:34:57,243 --> 00:34:59,558
Um Andy, what I said earlier…

490
00:35:01,067 --> 00:35:03,558
I did misread the café visit, right?

491
00:35:07,448 --> 00:35:08,743
Absolutely not.

492
00:35:10,648 --> 00:35:12,344
I’ll see you in class, Miss Roe.

493
00:35:16,938 --> 00:35:21,201
So, it’s almost midnight. The dares are done, we should head back.

494
00:35:22,661 --> 00:35:24,267
Actually, I can’t.

495
00:35:25,651 --> 00:35:27,242
I need to take off.

496
00:35:27,975 --> 00:35:31,431
You know, I had this… weird history of meeting girls

497
00:35:31,491 --> 00:35:33,407
and them… disappearing at the end of the night.

498
00:35:34,806 --> 00:35:36,284
You sure you can’t meet my friends?

499
00:35:37,303 --> 00:35:38,262
Not tonight.

500
00:35:40,247 --> 00:35:43,049
But how about… you give me your number?

501
00:35:49,804 --> 00:35:51,138
Can I have yours too?

502
00:35:51,430 --> 00:35:55,966
Luke, it was just ‘Dare Night’, right?

503
00:36:05,515 --> 00:36:07,107
No bonus points for you.

504
00:36:08,901 --> 00:36:09,728
Anna?

505
00:36:11,494 --> 00:36:12,974
I dare you to call me.

506
00:36:36,422 --> 00:36:38,408
The guys trail by a hundred and fifty points.

507
00:36:38,495 --> 00:36:39,303
Yes!

508
00:36:39,772 --> 00:36:40,613
We’re here.

509
00:36:40,991 --> 00:36:42,061
What is that?

510
00:36:42,235 --> 00:36:44,780
We had to capture a wild animal from the zoo.

511
00:36:44,902 --> 00:36:48,119
Yeah, you might wanna back up. This thing is kinda ferocious.

512
00:36:54,283 --> 00:36:57,806
Go ahead and laugh, but you shoulda seen this thing before we tamed it.

513
00:36:57,921 --> 00:37:01,292
I’m telling you, it was vicious. I mean it was snapping and…

514
00:37:02,501 --> 00:37:03,750
Oh man!

515
00:37:04,912 --> 00:37:08,444
Well, well. With your other dares, it appears to be a tie.

516
00:37:08,542 --> 00:37:11,240
Oh no, no. Wait, don’t forget this.

517
00:37:12,377 --> 00:37:14,650
Dude! What the hell are you doing?!

518
00:37:14,865 --> 00:37:16,919
It says it right here on the dare card.

519
00:37:18,112 --> 00:37:23,385
Man, that’s a typo. It’s supposed to say take a shot on the second hole.

520
00:37:25,311 --> 00:37:26,242
Tim!

521
00:37:27,230 --> 00:37:28,122
Gross!

522
00:37:28,342 --> 00:37:32,678
No dice. It’s still a tie and I just happen to have a tie breaker.

523
00:37:38,874 --> 00:37:41,500
Kiss a team mate on the mouth.

524
00:37:43,170 --> 00:37:44,823
Well I guess you guys win.

525
00:37:45,366 --> 00:37:46,252
Damn it!

526
00:37:46,353 --> 00:37:47,322
Convenient!

527
00:37:49,894 --> 00:37:50,726
Okay.

528
00:37:53,935 --> 00:37:54,597
Sorry!

529
00:37:57,091 --> 00:37:58,933
Okay! Alright.

530
00:38:01,436 --> 00:38:04,017
Unless any of you guys… kissed a stranger in a photo booth…

531
00:38:04,110 --> 00:38:05,655
that’s the only dare you didn’t do.

532
00:38:10,044 --> 00:38:11,084
Anybody?

533
00:38:16,130 --> 00:38:18,183
Sorry guys. Guess they win.

534
00:38:33,688 --> 00:38:37,324
You know Skills, you could always keep him. He could be your first pet.

535
00:38:37,421 --> 00:38:40,293
Man, I’m not bout to keep some creepy looking turtle, dawg.

536
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:44,931
Besides, caged up aint living. He need to be free.

537
00:38:51,209 --> 00:38:52,218
There you go.

538
00:38:53,923 --> 00:38:56,488
You realise that was a saltwater turtle, right?

539
00:39:01,707 --> 00:39:04,827
- Hey, did you have fun tonight?
- Eventually, missed you though.

540
00:39:11,777 --> 00:39:13,394
I guess I’ll see you later then.

541
00:39:14,483 --> 00:39:17,753
Tim. How about a game of NBA Live?

542
00:39:18,592 --> 00:39:19,380
Alright.

543
00:39:26,735 --> 00:39:29,508
You see, the ‘Tim’ is on the house and you better recognise...

544
00:39:29,569 --> 00:39:31,371
Just say you’re gonna beat me, Tim.

545
00:40:02,234 --> 00:40:04,842
Admit it; you had a good time tonight.

546
00:40:05,332 --> 00:40:09,838
By a good time, you mean wasting an entire evening of my life that I can never get back?

547
00:40:09,910 --> 00:40:10,909
Then sure.

548
00:40:13,719 --> 00:40:15,132
I have a question for you.

549
00:40:16,249 --> 00:40:19,514
You said you read people and that’s how you knew to invite all of us tonight.

550
00:40:21,808 --> 00:40:23,335
So how’d you read me?

551
00:40:25,516 --> 00:40:27,061
I don’t know about you yet.

552
00:40:28,635 --> 00:40:30,319
Gonna have to watch you a little more.

553
00:40:34,612 --> 00:40:38,679
So I guess this night makes us friends! Right?

554
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:41,014
Maybe.

555
00:40:41,142 --> 00:40:42,191
Friends with benefits?

556
00:40:43,825 --> 00:40:45,028
I’ll think about it.

557
00:40:58,387 --> 00:40:59,553
How was the mall?

558
00:41:01,587 --> 00:41:02,528
You don’t know?

559
00:41:03,077 --> 00:41:04,091
How would I?

560
00:41:05,540 --> 00:41:08,770
Fine. So, what’d you do tonight?

561
00:41:08,894 --> 00:41:11,309
Not much. Just explored really.

562
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:14,243
Trying to figure this place out.

563
00:41:14,653 --> 00:41:16,819
I think we’re gonna like it here, Felix.

564
00:41:16,911 --> 00:41:17,658
Yeah.

565
00:41:19,159 --> 00:41:20,025
Me too.

566
00:41:21,406 --> 00:41:24,187
Okay. Goodnight, little sister.

567
00:41:34,021 --> 00:41:36,433
Hey. How was your night?

568
00:41:37,284 --> 00:41:38,363
Was good!

569
00:41:39,001 --> 00:41:39,859
Yours?

570
00:41:40,481 --> 00:41:41,902
It was good.

571
00:41:42,594 --> 00:41:46,127
Hey, do you have a CD by The Constantines?

572
00:41:46,238 --> 00:41:47,591
Yeah. Uhh…

573
00:41:49,633 --> 00:41:50,617
Here we go.

574
00:41:51,841 --> 00:41:53,208
It’s very hip, mom.

575
00:41:53,463 --> 00:41:56,857
Thanks. I thought I’d try something daring.

576
