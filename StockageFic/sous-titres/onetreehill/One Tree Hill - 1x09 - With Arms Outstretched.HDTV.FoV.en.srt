1
00:01:36,334 --> 00:01:37,594
How’s your punching hand?

2
00:01:37,818 --> 00:01:40,112
A lot better now that I nailed a guy’s face.

3
00:01:41,735 --> 00:01:43,026
How ‘bout you? How are you feeling?

4
00:01:43,782 --> 00:01:44,919
Like an idiot.

5
00:01:46,178 --> 00:01:48,717
Luke, you’re cool with us being just friends, right?

6
00:01:48,928 --> 00:01:51,304
I mean, we are friends, right?

7
00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:52,742
We are.

8
00:01:53,075 --> 00:01:54,833
- Okay.
- And I’m cool with it.

9
00:01:55,001 --> 00:01:59,936
And besides, I wasn’t ready for all that Peyton Sawyer/Girlfriend drama anyway, you know.

10
00:02:00,357 --> 00:02:02,117
Hey, say hi to Brooke for me?

11
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:04,260
Alright. Talk to you later.

12
00:02:10,790 --> 00:02:11,520
Haley.

13
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:22,310
Mmm, we can’t do this here right now.

14
00:02:22,403 --> 00:02:23,274
We just did…

15
00:02:24,651 --> 00:02:26,295
Alright, I’ll kiss you later.

16
00:02:36,314 --> 00:02:38,311
When you leave this gym today,

17
00:02:40,655 --> 00:02:44,824
I want each one of you to look at the sun,

18
00:02:46,171 --> 00:02:49,688
because if you lose to Cove City on Friday,

19
00:02:49,928 --> 00:02:51,945
I can pretty much guarantee you

20
00:02:52,621 --> 00:02:55,709
that sun will not rise the next day.

21
00:02:56,851 --> 00:02:58,141
That’s not a joke.

22
00:03:00,045 --> 00:03:04,089
I’ve coached some great players and great teams in this gym,

23
00:03:06,103 --> 00:03:10,843
but not one of those great players or great teams has finished a season undefeated.

24
00:03:11,212 --> 00:03:14,330
You may be the first.

25
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:20,336
There are only two things separating you from greatness.

26
00:03:20,776 --> 00:03:23,859
Number one is Cove City.

27
00:03:24,237 --> 00:03:27,998
Number two… is you.

28
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:32,824
Hey, Brooke!

29
00:03:35,389 --> 00:03:36,399
I’ve got something for you.

30
00:03:36,541 --> 00:03:38,001
I know you do, gorgeous.

31
00:03:39,475 --> 00:03:41,026
It’s that book I was telling you about.

32
00:03:41,903 --> 00:03:44,820
- I though you might want to check it out.
- Oh, I definitely want to check it out.

33
00:03:45,584 --> 00:03:49,357
I suppose I could read the book too. But what are you going to do for me?

34
00:03:49,613 --> 00:03:50,514
What do you mean?

35
00:03:50,863 --> 00:03:53,961
Well, I read the book. You do something for me.

36
00:03:54,518 --> 00:03:56,700
- Like what?
- I don’t know. Something fun.

37
00:03:57,213 --> 00:04:00,330
- Deal?
- Okay. Deal.

38
00:04:00,508 --> 00:04:02,813
Should we shake on it or just make out now?

39
00:04:06,043 --> 00:04:08,286
Who knew reading could be so much fun?

40
00:04:20,781 --> 00:04:21,726
Need some help?

41
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,295
No. Everything is just fine.

42
00:04:26,174 --> 00:04:27,379
How about a cup of coffee?

43
00:04:31,474 --> 00:04:35,530
Deb, I know you claim your taking over the café’s not some sort of payback.

44
00:04:35,601 --> 00:04:38,208
It isn’t. I’m trying to help Karen.

45
00:04:41,428 --> 00:04:44,998
By ruining her business? That’s the worst cup of coffee I ever paid for.

46
00:04:45,156 --> 00:04:47,516
If you’ve come here to mock me, Dan, save it.

47
00:04:48,427 --> 00:04:49,892
I didn’t come here to mock you.

48
00:04:50,118 --> 00:04:52,615
I had a few hours. I thought maybe my wife could use my help.

49
00:04:53,743 --> 00:04:55,037
Clearly she can.

50
00:05:13,121 --> 00:05:14,258
How’s your sandwich?

51
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:16,787
Almost warm.

52
00:05:17,832 --> 00:05:21,324
Well, I’ll start cooking again. Unless your mother comes to her senses.

53
00:05:22,552 --> 00:05:25,615
You know, just when I think things can’t get any weirder around here,

54
00:05:25,845 --> 00:05:27,616
Mom takes over Karen’s café.

55
00:05:29,316 --> 00:05:31,211
I think I’m going to invite Lucas over to spend the night.

56
00:05:33,821 --> 00:05:36,085
Well, your mother hasn’t exactly been herself lately.

57
00:05:37,135 --> 00:05:39,254
It might help if you tell her you’re happy.

58
00:05:39,501 --> 00:05:40,826
She thinks I’ve ruined your life.

59
00:05:42,632 --> 00:05:44,184
Cove City game’s coming up.

60
00:05:45,586 --> 00:05:48,769
Yeah. Whitey claims that if we lose, the sun doesn’t rise.

61
00:05:48,952 --> 00:05:50,538
Well, he might actually be right for once.

62
00:05:51,137 --> 00:05:53,944
Of course, you know who scored the most points against the Cavaliers?

63
00:05:55,112 --> 00:05:56,653
- 42.
- Yeah.

64
00:05:56,822 --> 00:05:59,735
- I’m looking to top that this week.
- No. You won’t.

65
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:04,885
You want to know why? Because you’re not tough enough inside.

66
00:06:05,608 --> 00:06:09,023
I got coverage buckets you’ll never get because you can’t bang down low like I did.

67
00:06:10,225 --> 00:06:13,773
That plus the fact that your conditioning’s for crap. I never left the floor during a game.

68
00:06:14,931 --> 00:06:16,272
Hey, guys.

69
00:06:18,464 --> 00:06:20,804
I’m happy, Mom. Dad loves me.

70
00:06:24,803 --> 00:06:25,995
What was that all about?

71
00:06:26,406 --> 00:06:27,824
He was wondering where his mother was.

72
00:06:28,290 --> 00:06:31,203
Oh. Don’t start, Dan. I’m tired and I’m hungry.

73
00:06:31,264 --> 00:06:33,558
Oh, well. How about you eat first and then we argue?

74
00:06:33,834 --> 00:06:36,523
- How about we just don’t argue?
- How about we just don’t eat?

75
00:06:42,093 --> 00:06:43,076
What up, brother?

76
00:06:43,481 --> 00:06:44,914
You do know you’re white, Tim?

77
00:06:45,001 --> 00:06:45,769
What’s wrong with you?

78
00:06:46,701 --> 00:06:48,408
- Is your brother still dealing?
- Why?

79
00:06:48,927 --> 00:06:50,714
‘Cuz I need to tear it up against Cove City.

80
00:06:51,308 --> 00:06:52,588
So how’s getting high gonna help?

81
00:06:53,414 --> 00:06:55,846
Not weed, Tim. Performance enhancers.

82
00:06:56,388 --> 00:06:58,974
Look, just tell your brother that I’m gonna be on the floor for forty minutes,

83
00:06:59,031 --> 00:07:00,469
and I need to be in a different gear.

84
00:07:00,974 --> 00:07:01,949
You sure about this?

85
00:07:02,383 --> 00:07:03,935
Yeah. He’ll know what do get.

86
00:07:14,606 --> 00:07:16,883
So what, you going to avoid the café for the next six weeks?

87
00:07:17,867 --> 00:07:19,070
What, you don’t like pizza?

88
00:07:19,746 --> 00:07:22,388
I love pizza, but that’s not the point.

89
00:07:22,617 --> 00:07:26,607
Look, don’t you find it a bit strange, having Nathan’s mom running the café?

90
00:07:26,842 --> 00:07:29,013
Yeah. It’s a little strange.

91
00:07:29,724 --> 00:07:31,363
It’s also pretty gutsy of her.

92
00:07:31,791 --> 00:07:33,954
Dan’s gotta be giving her a lot of grief about it.

93
00:07:34,992 --> 00:07:37,523
You know, Luke, you really oughtta give her a chance.

94
00:07:38,143 --> 00:07:40,553
Deb’s okay. And when you think about it,

95
00:07:40,804 --> 00:07:44,803
when she got pregnant in college, her life changed a lot like your mom’s did.

96
00:07:45,093 --> 00:07:46,196
Yeah but Dan?

97
00:07:47,374 --> 00:07:49,436
Why does she stay with a guy like that?

98
00:07:50,132 --> 00:07:52,166
I don’t know. Maybe she wants to protect her son.

99
00:07:55,863 --> 00:07:59,191
Hey Handsome. Three more chapters and you’re all mine.

100
00:08:03,658 --> 00:08:04,802
What  was that all about?

101
00:08:05,832 --> 00:08:06,599
Nothing.

102
00:08:06,877 --> 00:08:09,967
Well I disagree. That was definitely something.

103
00:08:19,231 --> 00:08:20,116
Okay I got them.

104
00:08:21,474 --> 00:08:22,419
You sure about this?

105
00:08:22,867 --> 00:08:23,906
Have you met my dad?

106
00:08:24,985 --> 00:08:26,450
Okay, here’s the deal.

107
00:08:27,085 --> 00:08:28,549
These are basically amphetamines.

108
00:08:28,635 --> 00:08:31,984
They’re like, steroids on speed or speed on steroids.

109
00:08:32,615 --> 00:08:34,970
Anyway, you gotta be careful Nathan.

110
00:08:35,046 --> 00:08:36,633
Whatever  gets me jacked for Cove City, man.

111
00:08:36,715 --> 00:08:38,364
Here. These will definitely do that.

112
00:08:40,279 --> 00:08:43,587
Anyway, if you grow breasts… I get first peek.

113
00:08:48,062 --> 00:08:48,941
You’re welcome.

114
00:09:08,674 --> 00:09:11,163
Hold it. That was a foul.

115
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,483
Nathan, you’ve got to get off his back.

116
00:09:13,549 --> 00:09:14,962
Why don’t you get off my back, Whitey?

117
00:09:17,348 --> 00:09:19,432
How would you like to call that a practice.

118
00:09:19,601 --> 00:09:21,131
Whatever, man, that’s fine by me.

119
00:09:21,326 --> 00:09:23,287
- Nathan!
- What?! Huh!

120
00:09:23,768 --> 00:09:25,141
What the hell do you all want from me?

121
00:09:25,997 --> 00:09:27,383
Just walk away, son.

122
00:09:28,204 --> 00:09:29,641
Walk away.

123
00:09:34,306 --> 00:09:35,875
Fight ball up top.

124
00:09:42,016 --> 00:09:42,820
Very funny.

125
00:09:43,527 --> 00:09:46,395
Hey, are you okay? Lucas said you had some trouble at practice yesterday.

126
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:48,422
Lucas needs to mind his own business.

127
00:09:50,911 --> 00:09:53,377
We got a game coming up, that’s all. I just get a little intense.

128
00:09:53,767 --> 00:09:57,331
Are you, uh, okay? You’re shaking, Nathan.

129
00:09:58,329 --> 00:09:59,451
My heart’s racing too.

130
00:10:01,677 --> 00:10:03,061
That’s what happens when I’m around you.

131
00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:09,532
So your house tonight, right? Tutoring?

132
00:10:10,576 --> 00:10:12,388
- Are you sure you’re okay?
- Yeah, I’m fine.

133
00:10:12,456 --> 00:10:14,508
I just- I had a bad day yesterday.

134
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:17,350
- See you tonight.
- Yeah.

135
00:10:36,647 --> 00:10:40,498
If you came here to lecture me or argue, I get enough of that at home with the wife.

136
00:10:40,636 --> 00:10:42,509
I came here to talk about Nathan.

137
00:10:42,905 --> 00:10:45,786
His behavior concerns me.

138
00:10:46,452 --> 00:10:49,986
Really. You put Lucas on the team, give away his position,

139
00:10:50,068 --> 00:10:52,244
kick him off the team bus 30 miles away from home,

140
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:53,646
and now you’re worried.

141
00:10:54,762 --> 00:10:58,014
You forgot, uh, pressuring him and belittling him.

142
00:10:59,079 --> 00:11:01,166
Of course, that happens at home, doesn’t it?

143
00:11:04,643 --> 00:11:06,508
I remember when you came to me.

144
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:10,800
You were a scrawny freshman with a hell of a jump shot.

145
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:15,080
You loved the game.

146
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:18,920
What the hell happened along the way?

147
00:11:19,328 --> 00:11:20,270
You happened.

148
00:11:21,413 --> 00:11:24,397
There was always something for you to pick apart, something that wasn’t good enough.

149
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,933
But you are right. I did love the game.

150
00:11:27,116 --> 00:11:31,736
- I simply despised the way you controlled it.
- Who’s controlling Nathan now?

151
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:36,896
You’d be ashamed if you learned to hate that person like you hate me.

152
00:11:39,119 --> 00:11:40,824
I might be tough on him, Whitey.

153
00:11:41,116 --> 00:11:45,871
But then I’m not the one who told him the sun wouldn’t rise if he lost his next game.

154
00:11:59,568 --> 00:12:02,066
You really laid into Whitey yesterday.

155
00:12:02,161 --> 00:12:03,541
He deserved it.

156
00:12:06,844 --> 00:12:08,963
So Cove City’s pretty tough, eh?

157
00:12:11,605 --> 00:12:12,342
They suck.

158
00:12:15,108 --> 00:12:15,978
Listen man.

159
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:18,788
I know you’re under a lot of pressure from your dad.

160
00:12:18,855 --> 00:12:19,531
Hey!

161
00:12:20,279 --> 00:12:22,357
You don’t know anything about my dad, alright?

162
00:12:23,294 --> 00:12:26,413
Maybe if you knocked out a shot every now and then I wouldn’t have to carry us out there.

163
00:12:31,179 --> 00:12:33,862
All finished. Now it’s my turn.

164
00:12:34,083 --> 00:12:36,058
Hey, hey, hey. Not so fast.

165
00:12:36,913 --> 00:12:39,949
- Did you like it?
- Did I like it or did I read it?

166
00:12:40,815 --> 00:12:44,322
The book’s about how a guy loses his integrity and gives into temptation.

167
00:12:44,823 --> 00:12:48,756
Which is exactly what I see you doing tonight… with me.

168
00:12:51,783 --> 00:12:52,664
Right.

169
00:12:53,978 --> 00:12:56,144
Well, a deal’s a deal, right?

170
00:12:56,365 --> 00:12:58,361
That’s right, baby. A deal is a deal.

171
00:13:01,896 --> 00:13:02,769
Here you go.

172
00:13:08,704 --> 00:13:11,181
Thank you… Gretchen and Henry.

173
00:13:13,041 --> 00:13:16,625
Fake IDs. I used your yearbook photo.

174
00:13:22,041 --> 00:13:25,481
- I didn’t know you could shoot pool.
- There’s a lot you don’t know about me.

175
00:13:25,917 --> 00:13:26,603
Really?

176
00:13:29,291 --> 00:13:30,182
Like what?

177
00:13:31,513 --> 00:13:35,849
Like… I love it in the summer when there’s heat lightning at night.

178
00:13:37,156 --> 00:13:42,010
And up until the fourth grade, I called squirrels squirrlers.

179
00:13:45,113 --> 00:13:47,513
And I love beating boys at pool.

180
00:13:48,989 --> 00:13:53,729
Oh my God. A smile. Is Lucas Scott actually having fun?

181
00:13:54,666 --> 00:13:57,360
- I have fun.
- Sure you do.

182
00:13:57,937 --> 00:14:00,611
Lucas, you’re like the most serious guy I’ve ever met.

183
00:14:04,729 --> 00:14:05,475
Fine.

184
00:14:12,224 --> 00:14:13,396
Does that make you happy?

185
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:14,629
A little.

186
00:14:16,298 --> 00:14:17,840
Well, just as long as you don’t feel cheated.

187
00:14:18,714 --> 00:14:19,519
You read a book,

188
00:14:20,646 --> 00:14:22,775
I drink a beer. We’re even, right?

189
00:14:23,677 --> 00:14:27,528
Wait, did you think this was the thing you have to do with me?

190
00:14:27,962 --> 00:14:28,971
Well, yeah.

191
00:14:29,211 --> 00:14:31,644
No. This isn‘t the thing.

192
00:14:32,605 --> 00:14:36,108
This is just… drinks before the thing.

193
00:14:37,413 --> 00:14:38,494
Bottoms up.

194
00:14:43,394 --> 00:14:46,911
Nathan. Are you going to pace all night, or can we get started?

195
00:14:47,541 --> 00:14:49,081
Are these all your brothers and sisters?

196
00:14:49,374 --> 00:14:51,622
Yeah. I’m the youngest.

197
00:14:52,087 --> 00:14:54,479
I don’t think my parents know what to do with the silence.

198
00:14:58,963 --> 00:15:02,410
So a month ago, did you think we’d be alone in your bedroom?

199
00:15:03,245 --> 00:15:05,057
Oh, but we’re not alone in my bedroom.

200
00:15:05,227 --> 00:15:07,992
-  We have the forefathers with us.
- They can watch.

201
00:15:09,235 --> 00:15:11,820
Nathan, can you just get serious for a minute?

202
00:15:11,922 --> 00:15:14,216
Oh, I’m serious. Come here.

203
00:15:24,869 --> 00:15:27,895
- My parents could come home.
- Come on…

204
00:15:32,853 --> 00:15:34,446
Nathan, come on, stop it.

205
00:15:35,511 --> 00:15:36,258
Come on…

206
00:15:37,866 --> 00:15:39,495
- Don’t… Hey!
- What?

207
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:41,363
God…

208
00:15:45,306 --> 00:15:46,305
I think you should go.

209
00:15:49,095 --> 00:15:50,022
You’re kidding, right?

210
00:15:53,003 --> 00:15:53,688
Haley…

211
00:15:56,784 --> 00:16:00,235
Alright, Haley, I’m sorry. We can study, it’s fine.

212
00:16:00,926 --> 00:16:01,832
I’d like you to go.

213
00:16:05,827 --> 00:16:06,671
Unbelievable.

214
00:16:26,793 --> 00:16:28,648
Don’t you love weird science?

215
00:16:30,930 --> 00:16:32,483
Ah, the family jewels.

216
00:16:32,558 --> 00:16:34,612
He doesn’t even have a license, Lisa.

217
00:16:41,003 --> 00:16:41,816
Out of area?

218
00:16:43,164 --> 00:16:43,926
Booty call?

219
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:48,708
Hey, this is Lucas’ cell phone. Please leave a message.

220
00:16:50,817 --> 00:16:51,969
Where were we?

221
00:16:53,013 --> 00:16:54,232
Where we were having fun.

222
00:16:56,827 --> 00:16:58,318
I’m glad we did this.

223
00:16:59,679 --> 00:17:00,510
Good.

224
00:17:02,327 --> 00:17:04,231
So what’s your take on tattoos?

225
00:17:05,855 --> 00:17:06,659
I don’t know…

226
00:17:07,442 --> 00:17:08,246
depends.

227
00:17:09,843 --> 00:17:10,560
Come here.

228
00:17:20,579 --> 00:17:21,399
What do you think…

229
00:17:22,673 --> 00:17:23,451
About…

230
00:17:26,844 --> 00:17:27,953
this tattoo?

231
00:17:31,243 --> 00:17:37,405
That tattoo is very, very… sexy.

232
00:17:38,003 --> 00:17:39,106
Right answer.

233
00:18:02,668 --> 00:18:05,016
Keith! Hey man.

234
00:18:06,292 --> 00:18:07,055
You okay?

235
00:18:08,683 --> 00:18:09,629
I’m perfect.

236
00:18:11,631 --> 00:18:12,814
Have you been drinking?

237
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:18,497
Oh Keith. There is this girl.

238
00:18:19,926 --> 00:18:22,609
Now I know how my hope and Aunt felt when I came rolling in…

239
00:18:23,572 --> 00:18:25,266
You know, you had me worried sick, Luke?

240
00:18:27,243 --> 00:18:29,685
Why don’t you go and sleep it off and...

241
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:31,779
we’ll deal with this tomorrow?

242
00:18:41,871 --> 00:18:45,312
What are you doing, Dad? Still looking for your name in the box scores?

243
00:18:49,659 --> 00:18:52,910
Hey. Knock it off and get serious. You’ve got a big game coming up.

244
00:18:55,229 --> 00:18:57,093
And you think you’re gonna break my scoring record.

245
00:19:05,101 --> 00:19:06,688
Come on, Tara Reid, you’re gonna be late.

246
00:19:09,519 --> 00:19:10,324
What’s up?

247
00:19:11,736 --> 00:19:12,586
Nothing.

248
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:13,881
What are you hiding?

249
00:19:16,467 --> 00:19:17,492
Check that out.

250
00:19:17,788 --> 00:19:18,869
Tell me that’s a joke.

251
00:19:20,350 --> 00:19:23,431
No, no, no. Just, just… wipe it off, okay.

252
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:24,715
Keith, it’s a tattoo.

253
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:25,799
A tattoo.

254
00:19:26,881 --> 00:19:30,163
- Of what?
- It’s an ancient symbol for fun.

255
00:19:30,347 --> 00:19:34,295
Oh, for fun? Because I thought it was for freaking fool.

256
00:19:34,397 --> 00:19:35,811
- Keith…
- Luke.

257
00:19:36,547 --> 00:19:41,530
Your mom trusted me. She’s gone five days and now you scar yourself for life.

258
00:19:41,611 --> 00:19:45,098
- It’s just a tattoo.
- It’s a tattoo. There is no just.

259
00:19:46,394 --> 00:19:47,848
God. What were you thinking?

260
00:19:49,149 --> 00:19:53,562
This is a bunch of crap. You’re out half the night, you’re drunk, and now you got a tattoo.

261
00:19:54,166 --> 00:19:56,101
What, did you join the navy too?

262
00:19:57,284 --> 00:19:58,671
You took advantage of me, Luke.

263
00:19:58,881 --> 00:20:00,995
You’d have never would’ve pulled a stunt like this with your mom here.

264
00:20:01,114 --> 00:20:01,943
What stunt?

265
00:20:02,808 --> 00:20:04,867
You mean actually enjoying myself for once?

266
00:20:06,772 --> 00:20:08,031
You said it yourself.

267
00:20:08,692 --> 00:20:10,458
My mom’s not here. Is she?

268
00:20:10,868 --> 00:20:12,055
Your ass is grounded.

269
00:20:12,623 --> 00:20:13,330
Keith…

270
00:20:14,119 --> 00:20:15,080
Bread and water.

271
00:20:15,563 --> 00:20:17,647
Hard core grounded. Start now.

272
00:20:18,927 --> 00:20:19,818
You know…

273
00:20:20,579 --> 00:20:22,101
I expected more from you.

274
00:20:31,266 --> 00:20:32,152
What did you do last night?

275
00:20:32,663 --> 00:20:34,615
- Nothing, you?
- Nothing.

276
00:20:36,837 --> 00:20:38,738
Actually I kinda made out with Brooke.

277
00:20:40,421 --> 00:20:42,573
- What?
- While I was drunk.

278
00:20:42,761 --> 00:20:47,088
Oh. Wow. Slow night for you. What happened.

279
00:20:47,611 --> 00:20:50,544
Well, we went out as friends and things just kind of escalated.

280
00:20:50,616 --> 00:20:51,558
Yeah. Sounds like.

281
00:20:53,156 --> 00:20:55,228
You and Brooke Davis. Please.

282
00:20:55,694 --> 00:20:58,899
- What, is that so strange?
- Yeah, it is.

283
00:20:59,223 --> 00:21:00,871
You know, she’s different than people see?

284
00:21:01,838 --> 00:21:04,132
You of all people should understand that.

285
00:21:07,087 --> 00:21:08,450
I’ve been kissing Nathan.

286
00:21:09,822 --> 00:21:12,554
If I told you not to do that anymore would you listen?

287
00:21:12,832 --> 00:21:14,393
- Would you?
- Maybe.

288
00:21:14,848 --> 00:21:16,764
- Probably not.
- Probably not. Yeah.

289
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:19,845
So what about Peyton?

290
00:21:20,378 --> 00:21:23,523
- Yeah, you can kiss her if you want.
- I’m serious.

291
00:21:24,239 --> 00:21:30,352
Look, I told her how I felt, alright? She doesn’t feel the same way.

292
00:21:30,496 --> 00:21:31,847
Maybe she’s just not ready.

293
00:21:31,970 --> 00:21:34,889
Nah. She just wants to be friends.

294
00:21:35,047 --> 00:21:37,710
So are you and Brooke Davis like a thing now?

295
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:41,960
No. We went out. We had fun.

296
00:21:43,086 --> 00:21:47,095
Alright, well, if that’s what you want. I mean, you deserve to be happy.

297
00:21:47,326 --> 00:21:48,094
Yeah.

298
00:21:49,804 --> 00:21:50,500
You too.

299
00:21:58,462 --> 00:22:02,204
Hi, friend. Guess who I went out with last night. I’ll tell you. Lucas.

300
00:22:03,131 --> 00:22:04,329
Definite  went out.

301
00:22:04,478 --> 00:22:08,118
We met at a bar, shot some pool, had a few drinks.

302
00:22:08,221 --> 00:22:10,285
- Lucas Scott?
- Yep.

303
00:22:11,175 --> 00:22:13,146
You didn’t tell me he was such a good kisser.

304
00:22:15,887 --> 00:22:16,894
I gotta go.

305
00:22:24,237 --> 00:22:24,957
Hi…

306
00:22:25,828 --> 00:22:26,663
So what do you think?

307
00:22:27,657 --> 00:22:29,049
Uh, about what?

308
00:22:29,464 --> 00:22:31,840
Long counter here, some retro books.

309
00:22:32,459 --> 00:22:34,032
I don’t follow.

310
00:22:34,277 --> 00:22:36,702
Deb’s Diner. The hottest little place in town.

311
00:22:37,201 --> 00:22:42,044
Dan… I don’t want a diner. What’s this really about?

312
00:22:43,017 --> 00:22:44,035
You tell me.

313
00:22:44,849 --> 00:22:48,127
I told you. I’m simply trying to help Karen.

314
00:22:48,382 --> 00:22:49,708
You hardly know the woman.

315
00:22:49,770 --> 00:22:50,753
Well, that’s not true.

316
00:22:51,189 --> 00:22:54,281
But for the sake of discussion, lets say you’re right.

317
00:22:54,767 --> 00:22:56,811
Lets say I’m doing it to help you.

318
00:22:56,939 --> 00:22:57,618
Me?

319
00:22:58,105 --> 00:23:00,153
What do you feel when you see Lucas?

320
00:23:01,557 --> 00:23:04,696
I mean it was different when we never saw him. But now...

321
00:23:04,752 --> 00:23:08,060
- What do you want me to say?
- Anything. Something honest.

322
00:23:08,571 --> 00:23:13,584
Okay, then how does this sound? I was a kid, I made a decision.

323
00:23:13,675 --> 00:23:18,038
And I’m tired of you and everyone else holding it over my head every day of my life.

324
00:23:18,192 --> 00:23:21,136
So if you’re running that little café so you can find absolution for me, forget it.

325
00:23:21,187 --> 00:23:23,225
I don’t need it and I don’t want it.

326
00:23:30,066 --> 00:23:31,888
What’s going on? You said you wanted to talk.

327
00:23:34,658 --> 00:23:36,631
Do you think second chances are a lie?

328
00:23:37,438 --> 00:23:39,455
Well, it depends on who you are dealing with, I guess.

329
00:23:39,789 --> 00:23:40,592
Yeah…

330
00:23:42,353 --> 00:23:44,084
How are things going with you and Nathan?

331
00:23:47,706 --> 00:23:50,335
Not so great. I don’t know what he wants us to be.

332
00:23:50,453 --> 00:23:55,886
Are we a couple? Are we just hanging out? Is it for sex because if it is…

333
00:23:55,978 --> 00:23:56,976
If it is what?

334
00:23:58,133 --> 00:23:59,265
That’s not enough for me.

335
00:23:59,423 --> 00:24:00,314
Bad experience?

336
00:24:05,148 --> 00:24:07,128
What, are you a virgin?

337
00:24:07,426 --> 00:24:09,402
Yeah. So what if I am?

338
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:11,138
Good for you.

339
00:24:17,077 --> 00:24:18,102
So what are you going to do?

340
00:24:18,439 --> 00:24:20,053
Try and get some answers I guess.

341
00:24:25,285 --> 00:24:27,307
Did Lucas tell you what happened between us?

342
00:24:30,169 --> 00:24:32,940
Yeah. He just said that you weren’t ready for a relationship.

343
00:24:35,703 --> 00:24:36,913
Did he tell you about Brooke?

344
00:24:37,302 --> 00:24:38,532
That they went out? Yeah…

345
00:24:40,210 --> 00:24:41,120
You okay with that?

346
00:24:42,268 --> 00:24:43,414
He’s fair game.

347
00:24:43,783 --> 00:24:47,102
Plus, she’s really not the dating kind, if you know what I mean.

348
00:24:49,564 --> 00:24:54,009
Is connecting with someone really this complicated, or is it simple and we just make it worse?

349
00:24:55,258 --> 00:24:57,158
For me its complicated.

350
00:24:57,900 --> 00:24:59,375
You just make it worse.

351
00:25:13,118 --> 00:25:16,808
Hey, I got you some tape.

352
00:25:18,063 --> 00:25:20,412
For the tattoo. You gotta cover it for the game, right?

353
00:25:20,561 --> 00:25:22,291
Thanks. I appreciate it.

354
00:25:22,905 --> 00:25:23,613
Let me see it.

355
00:25:29,521 --> 00:25:34,319
Geez, Luke. Where’d you get this thing? Some back alley in the Philippines?

356
00:25:35,749 --> 00:25:38,041
You know, you can get Hepatitis, HIV from..

357
00:25:41,862 --> 00:25:43,037
Does it hurt?

358
00:25:43,484 --> 00:25:44,256
A little.

359
00:25:44,927 --> 00:25:47,334
Well… we’ll get it checked before the game.

360
00:25:48,639 --> 00:25:49,980
Keith, man, you worry too much.

361
00:25:52,397 --> 00:25:54,712
I’ve got to worry once for myself and once for your mother.

362
00:26:05,413 --> 00:26:07,169
Your arms are going to be dead for the game tonight.

363
00:26:07,757 --> 00:26:08,909
Yeah. You wish.

364
00:26:09,703 --> 00:26:12,869
No I don’t. I’d love for you to break my record, Nathan.

365
00:26:13,082 --> 00:26:15,131
- I just don’t think you will.
- We’ll see about that.

366
00:26:16,432 --> 00:26:20,618
Good news and bad news, Nate. Bad news is I have to be at the café

367
00:26:20,676 --> 00:26:25,124
so I’m gonna miss your game. Good news is Haley can be there.

368
00:26:25,743 --> 00:26:26,389
Whatever.

369
00:26:28,586 --> 00:26:29,825
At least one of us will be there.

370
00:26:39,084 --> 00:26:41,136
- Nathan!
- Not now, Haley.

371
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:43,495
Okay, after the game, can we get some food and talk?

372
00:26:43,557 --> 00:26:45,308
Haley, I said not now, okay?

373
00:26:45,579 --> 00:26:46,824
Why are you being like this?

374
00:26:46,977 --> 00:26:51,386
Because I can, okay? That’s how it works. People are mean, life’s a bitch.

375
00:26:51,565 --> 00:26:52,834
What is your problem?

376
00:26:53,401 --> 00:26:56,331
What’s my problem? My problem’s on the other side of the wall.

377
00:26:56,415 --> 00:26:59,305
And in five minutes, if I’m not perfect, they’re going to eat me alive.

378
00:26:59,486 --> 00:27:00,392
That’s my problem.

379
00:27:16,114 --> 00:27:20,591
That’s 38 points for Nathan Scott tonight, and we’re early in the fourth quarter.

380
00:27:20,862 --> 00:27:23,825
He’s 5 points from breaking the all time high against Cove City,

381
00:27:23,881 --> 00:27:25,878
set of course by He-Who-Won’t-Be-Named.

382
00:27:31,657 --> 00:27:34,937
Another 4 pointer for Nathan and now he’s a basket away from the record.

383
00:27:35,981 --> 00:27:36,667
Yeah, baby!

384
00:27:40,405 --> 00:27:41,235
This is it.

385
00:27:47,347 --> 00:27:48,566
No basket!

386
00:27:48,678 --> 00:27:51,832
Oh, no basket! Nathan Scott is whistled for charge-

387
00:27:51,873 --> 00:27:54,886
- He was moving at speed. What are you talking about?
- One! Two! Three! Easy, son.

388
00:27:54,982 --> 00:27:57,024
- Time out!
- Keep your eyes on the game!

389
00:27:57,194 --> 00:27:59,026
- Time out!
- Coach, you better watch your boy?

390
00:28:00,849 --> 00:28:01,811
What’s he doing?

391
00:28:06,568 --> 00:28:09,471
Nathan, I don’t care how many points you’ve got.

392
00:28:09,589 --> 00:28:14,131
You keep this up, I’ll move you so far down the bench they’ll have to pump air into you.

393
00:28:19,573 --> 00:28:20,489
Just give me the ball.

394
00:28:22,026 --> 00:28:23,786
Alright, lets go fellas. Defense on three.

395
00:28:23,859 --> 00:28:25,118
One! Two! Three! Defense!

396
00:28:25,724 --> 00:28:26,414
You alright?

397
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:28,266
I will be 2 points from now.

398
00:28:33,571 --> 00:28:35,081
Here we go, folks. This is it!

399
00:28:36,019 --> 00:28:39,121
Luke waits for Nathan Scott to come free! He’s got 41 points.

400
00:28:58,248 --> 00:28:59,895
Coach! Coach!

401
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,315
Easy, son.

402
00:29:16,489 --> 00:29:17,589
You’re okay.

403
00:29:19,711 --> 00:29:20,600
Can you hear me?

404
00:29:21,542 --> 00:29:22,253
Yeah.

405
00:29:23,293 --> 00:29:24,808
You collapsed during the game.

406
00:29:26,476 --> 00:29:29,416
Nathan, how are you feeling?

407
00:29:31,184 --> 00:29:32,339
I have to piss.

408
00:29:33,635 --> 00:29:35,309
You were severely dehydrated.

409
00:29:35,877 --> 00:29:38,857
We have you in these ice packs because you body temperature was very high.

410
00:29:39,687 --> 00:29:43,378
Now, I need to ask you some questions about the supplements you’re taking.

411
00:29:43,910 --> 00:29:46,072
Uh, Benzedrine, Mephedrine.

412
00:29:47,699 --> 00:29:50,736
Anabolic steroids? Anadrol, Dianabol?

413
00:29:52,892 --> 00:29:53,506
Okay.

414
00:29:54,387 --> 00:29:57,377
What about speed? And uh, cocaine? Ecstasy?

415
00:29:57,586 --> 00:29:59,614
Hey, Doc, he’s an athlete, not a junkie, okay?

416
00:30:00,034 --> 00:30:00,930
And he’s also a kid.

417
00:30:01,524 --> 00:30:03,352
True, but he’s my kid.

418
00:30:03,715 --> 00:30:06,433
So how about you play a little more doctor and a little less detective?

419
00:30:07,182 --> 00:30:09,214
Mr. Scott, could I speak with you?

420
00:30:16,495 --> 00:30:18,390
Listen to me, son. You’re going to be fine, okay?

421
00:30:19,189 --> 00:30:22,284
You’ve been hitting it a little hard lately, we’ll back a notch or two.

422
00:30:22,367 --> 00:30:23,433
You’ll be as good as new.

423
00:30:25,086 --> 00:30:27,656
Hell, the scouts won’t even remember this come to post season.

424
00:30:33,788 --> 00:30:37,687
The early results tell me that your son is going to be fine, physically.

425
00:30:37,795 --> 00:30:38,454
That’s great.

426
00:30:38,530 --> 00:30:41,804
But they also tell me he’s taking some sort of amphetamine.

427
00:30:42,485 --> 00:30:43,995
There’s got to be some kind of mistake.

428
00:30:44,553 --> 00:30:49,441
Mr. Scott, these kids are under a lot of pressure to perform, and granted, it could be an isolated case,

429
00:30:49,546 --> 00:30:52,402
but there could be a more serious problem.

430
00:30:52,586 --> 00:30:56,765
Look Doc, I appreciate your concern, I really do. But I gotta tell you.

431
00:30:56,836 --> 00:31:00,358
I know my son. And if he says he’s clean, he’s clean.

432
00:31:01,153 --> 00:31:03,687
So if you label him an addict, you take away his future.

433
00:31:04,112 --> 00:31:08,162
So unless you’ve got your results 100 percent accurate, you’re looking at a lawsuit you don’t want.

434
00:31:08,412 --> 00:31:11,714
Now from where I stand, your job is to get him well.

435
00:31:12,509 --> 00:31:13,435
I’ll do the rest.

436
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:15,017
Are we clear?

437
00:31:17,772 --> 00:31:20,879
Hey. I was on my way to check on him, and then I realized you were here,

438
00:31:20,937 --> 00:31:23,774
so I turned around and came back. You should go. How is he?

439
00:31:23,956 --> 00:31:25,632
- Who?
- Nathan.

440
00:31:26,006 --> 00:31:26,896
What about him?

441
00:31:28,155 --> 00:31:30,679
I appreciate it, Keith. Thanks.

442
00:31:34,196 --> 00:31:35,232
How are you doing, son?

443
00:31:44,703 --> 00:31:45,589
He’s okay.

444
00:31:49,690 --> 00:31:50,807
Where is he?

445
00:32:17,898 --> 00:32:18,536
Hey.

446
00:32:21,009 --> 00:32:22,858
I talked to Dan.

447
00:32:23,585 --> 00:32:24,892
Nathan’s going to be fine.

448
00:32:28,702 --> 00:32:30,738
You know why they made whiskey, Keith?

449
00:32:33,549 --> 00:32:41,085
For the poor fool that wakes up after 35 years and discovers he’s a part of the problem.

450
00:32:47,639 --> 00:32:50,767
Well, no more.

451
00:32:51,941 --> 00:32:56,066
I’ll forfeit the damn games before I lose a boy to that.

452
00:32:58,843 --> 00:33:02,201
I’ve got to be the sorriest son of a bitch on the planet.

453
00:33:05,738 --> 00:33:09,486
Well, Karen left me to watch Luke.

454
00:33:09,861 --> 00:33:14,684
And uh, he got drunk and then he got a tattoo.

455
00:33:15,984 --> 00:33:17,248
Well, I take it back.

456
00:33:21,617 --> 00:33:23,767
I tried to call you but you weren’t answering your phone.

457
00:33:23,813 --> 00:33:28,390
Because I ran out of the café with nothing but my car keys and the fear that my son was dying.

458
00:33:28,446 --> 00:33:29,633
Oh, and that’s my fault?

459
00:33:29,757 --> 00:33:32,496
After Haley walked in… how long was that, Dan?

460
00:33:32,542 --> 00:33:35,578
20 minutes after Nathan collapsed? A half hour, maybe?

461
00:33:35,635 --> 00:33:38,164
My first concern was for Nathan. You’re overreacting.

462
00:33:38,226 --> 00:33:42,051
Oh. Overreacting? That my son nearly died and my husband didn’t see fit to call?

463
00:33:42,670 --> 00:33:45,476
Where is he, Dan? He could be anywhere. He could be unconscious.

464
00:33:45,553 --> 00:33:47,800
Get a hold of yourself. The doctor said he’s out of harm’s way.

465
00:33:47,866 --> 00:33:49,049
Well the doctor was wrong.

466
00:33:50,370 --> 00:33:53,739
Because as long as you control him the way you do, he’ll be in harm’s way.

467
00:33:53,825 --> 00:33:56,335
Ohhh… okay. Yeah, I get it. I’m to blame. It’s gotta be my fault.

468
00:33:56,397 --> 00:33:56,986
Yeah.

469
00:33:57,031 --> 00:34:00,032
Would you consider this, lady? If you weren’t off helping your little friend Karen and her café,

470
00:34:00,082 --> 00:34:01,824
you might’ve been there for him like I was.

471
00:34:03,555 --> 00:34:05,521
You smug son of a bitch.

472
00:34:07,389 --> 00:34:09,144
- I want you out of this house.
- Deb…

473
00:34:09,246 --> 00:34:10,860
I said get out!

474
00:34:11,855 --> 00:34:15,634
- It’s been an emotional night…
- No, no, no, Dan. It’s been a night of clarity.

475
00:34:16,063 --> 00:34:17,532
And it’s time for you to go.

476
00:34:19,314 --> 00:34:20,604
It’s my house.

477
00:34:21,357 --> 00:34:23,734
Fine, then I’ll go.

478
00:34:24,603 --> 00:34:26,601
But either way, Nathan stays with me.

479
00:34:27,921 --> 00:34:28,931
Don’t do this.

480
00:34:29,509 --> 00:34:31,141
I’ll say it one more time, Dan.

481
00:34:31,649 --> 00:34:33,711
Pack a bag and get out.

482
00:34:34,126 --> 00:34:36,856
Or so help me God, I will stab you in your sleep.

483
00:34:45,007 --> 00:34:48,165
And you better pray that my son is okay.

484
00:34:54,141 --> 00:34:56,910
Do you really think Nathan would choose you over me?

485
00:35:08,372 --> 00:35:09,783
Hey, its me.

486
00:35:12,008 --> 00:35:13,807
I guess I’m just worried about you.

487
00:35:15,978 --> 00:35:18,758
- I really hate the way we ended things.
- So do I.

488
00:35:22,358 --> 00:35:23,601
Nobody answered the door.

489
00:35:25,921 --> 00:35:27,242
They’re gone for the weekend.

490
00:35:31,325 --> 00:35:32,254
How are you?

491
00:35:33,602 --> 00:35:34,677
Not so good.

492
00:35:37,333 --> 00:35:38,096
Can I...

493
00:35:46,047 --> 00:35:48,419
I made a lot of mistakes, Haley.

494
00:35:52,526 --> 00:35:53,985
Sometimes because of my dad,

495
00:35:55,447 --> 00:35:57,277
sometimes by choice.

496
00:36:07,101 --> 00:36:08,608
I just can’t do it anymore.

497
00:36:10,808 --> 00:36:12,679
- It’s okay…
- No.

498
00:36:13,871 --> 00:36:16,087
No, it’s not okay. I’m not okay.

499
00:36:19,482 --> 00:36:21,003
I lived for tonight.

500
00:36:24,090 --> 00:36:25,360
I was so scared.

501
00:36:27,239 --> 00:36:28,421
I’m still terrified.

502
00:36:32,847 --> 00:36:34,452
Then I saw you.

503
00:36:35,805 --> 00:36:38,410
I promised myself that if I could just get up,

504
00:36:39,506 --> 00:36:41,083
and walk over to you,

505
00:36:42,523 --> 00:36:44,099
and tell you how much I need you,

506
00:36:45,860 --> 00:36:47,197
and how much I want you,

507
00:36:49,358 --> 00:36:50,868
that nothing else matters.

508
00:37:14,403 --> 00:37:15,066
Peyton?

509
00:37:15,783 --> 00:37:16,658
I heard about Nathan.

510
00:37:19,013 --> 00:37:19,606
Yeah,

511
00:37:21,814 --> 00:37:22,699
he’s gonna be okay.

512
00:37:25,347 --> 00:37:26,458
So… what’s up?

513
00:37:30,067 --> 00:37:31,686
Lucas, I made a mistake.

514
00:37:34,051 --> 00:37:38,284
When you said you wanted to be with me, I got, I got scared, but...

515
00:37:39,189 --> 00:37:40,081
Peyton…

516
00:37:40,194 --> 00:37:46,098
But, the truth is, I want all the same things that you want, I do.

517
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:49,144
And I want them with you.

518
00:37:51,526 --> 00:37:53,855
Okay, superstar, are you ready to score?

519
00:37:56,692 --> 00:37:57,516
Hey…

520
00:37:59,819 --> 00:38:01,831
we missed you after the game tonight.

521
00:38:02,813 --> 00:38:08,067
Yeah. I just… I guess I just kind of got turned around.

522
00:38:11,003 --> 00:38:11,852
Peyton…

523
00:39:09,114 --> 00:39:10,151
Haley…

524
00:39:15,244 --> 00:39:16,846
Can I stay with you for tonight?

525
00:39:36,697 --> 00:39:38,482
What a frightening thing is the human,

526
00:39:40,496 --> 00:39:43,858
a mass of gages and dials and registers.

527
00:39:49,605 --> 00:39:51,247
And we can read only a few.

528
00:39:55,610 --> 00:39:58,006
And those perhaps not accurately.
