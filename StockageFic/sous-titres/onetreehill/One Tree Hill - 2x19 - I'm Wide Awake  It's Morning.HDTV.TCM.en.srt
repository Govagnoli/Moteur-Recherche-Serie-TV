00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,132
Joseph Conrad once wrote: Who knows what true happiness is,…

2
00:00:04,176 --> 00:00:06,733
not the conventional word,…

3
00:00:09,865 --> 00:00:12,109
but the naked terror.

4
00:00:14,458 --> 00:00:18,164
To the lonely themselves, that wears a mask,…

5
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:25,575
the most miserable outcast,…

6
00:00:27,193 --> 00:00:29,386
hugs some memory,…

7
00:00:33,509 --> 00:00:36,067
or some illusion.

8
00:00:52,912 --> 00:00:54,948
How much for the wall?

9
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,429
Come on, man, I’m serious, I-I’ll take it.
The whole thing; the… pink paint, the creepy clown.

10
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:02,923
Look, I’ll give you, uh,

11
00:01:03,048 --> 00:01:06,138
five-hundred and… whatever fell on the floor.

12
00:01:06,681 --> 00:01:09,855
- How ya doing, Coop?
-Better than you, you little bitch!

13
00:01:10,022 --> 00:01:12,527
Come here and give your uncle some love!

14
00:01:13,571 --> 00:01:15,701
Hey. It’s good to see you, kid.

15
00:01:18,226 --> 00:01:20,606
So, your mom called me.

16
00:01:20,732 --> 00:01:26,369
And I gotta tell you, Nate, if my big sister is calling me,
then the situation is pretty eff’d up, you know?

17
00:01:26,912 --> 00:01:28,665
Nah, keep it.

18
00:01:28,832 --> 00:01:30,169
And by the way,

19
00:01:30,252 --> 00:01:35,138
I could beat your ass for looking like this, you handsome bastard!
I mean, I’m starting to finally feel good about myself;

20
00:01:35,189 --> 00:01:39,486
I’m a race car driver, I’m making a few
bucks and now I gotta compete with this?!
-Dude, stop it.

21
00:01:39,550 --> 00:01:43,270
I’m serious, what’s wrong with her?
What, d’ya marry a blind girl? Unless it

22
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:44,874
Oh man,

23
00:01:45,344 --> 00:01:46,413
it's your gear, isn't it?

24
00:01:46,485 --> 00:01:48,324
OK, drop your shorts, let’s have a look.

25
00:01:48,336 --> 00:01:50,416
-No, come on, let’s see it!
-What're you doing here, man?

26
00:01:50,444 --> 00:01:52,099
Perspective, nephew,

27
00:01:52,934 --> 00:01:54,590
I’m here to adjust yours.

28
00:02:42,675 --> 00:02:44,823
Hey Brooke, you decent?

29
00:02:44,863 --> 00:02:46,834
Am I dressed? Yes.

30
00:02:47,053 --> 00:02:49,789
Am I decent? Never have been.

31
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:53,706
-What time is it anyway?
-Ah, it's early.

32
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:57,386
I’m sorry to wake you; I just gotta
stash something in my closet.

33
00:02:57,573 --> 00:02:58,503
So,

34
00:02:58,832 --> 00:03:00,597
I went to see Jake.

35
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:03,087
How’s Peyton doing, anyway?

36
00:03:04,385 --> 00:03:05,754
I'm worried about her.

37
00:03:05,918 --> 00:03:07,122
Yeah, me too.

38
00:03:08,927 --> 00:03:12,580
It’s hard, isn’t it? Being apart from the person you care about.

39
00:03:13,579 --> 00:03:14,208
Yeah.

40
00:03:16,725 --> 00:03:18,655
So, what’s in the bag, anyway?

41
00:03:19,256 --> 00:03:20,460
I don't know yet.

42
00:03:21,336 --> 00:03:25,318
Anyway, uh, apparently I’m… taking
a road trip with Nathan and his uncle.

43
00:03:25,371 --> 00:03:28,805
So, just tell Peyton if… she needs anything, that

44
00:03:29,476 --> 00:03:30,529
Sure.

45
00:03:30,953 --> 00:03:32,021
I got her.

46
00:03:35,125 --> 00:03:35,946
Thanks.

47
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:39,285
See ya.

48
00:03:41,998 --> 00:03:45,118
On the first day of this class I presented
you with a controversial notion;

49
00:03:45,181 --> 00:03:47,398
that ethics matter more than profits.

50
00:03:47,591 --> 00:03:48,708
Anyone buying that yet?

51
00:03:51,776 --> 00:03:53,653
-Yes?
-Yeah, I have a question.

52
00:03:56,869 --> 00:03:58,945
May I ask what you’re doing in my classroom?

53
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,489
...Auditing.

54
00:04:02,251 --> 00:04:05,594
I was wondering, what would you say about a person…

55
00:04:06,167 --> 00:04:08,157
let’s call this person…

56
00:04:08,465 --> 00:04:09,257
Randy.

57
00:04:09,365 --> 00:04:13,205
Now Randy hires a private investigator
to dig up dirt on a competitor.

58
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:15,091
I’m afraid I’m gonna have to ask you to leave.

59
00:04:16,789 --> 00:04:17,636
Of course.

60
00:04:21,704 --> 00:04:23,385
Oh, one last question.

61
00:04:23,617 --> 00:04:28,032
Let’s say our guy, Randy, was teaching
a class on ethics, and yet,

62
00:04:28,226 --> 00:04:32,107
was sleeping with one of his students…

63
00:04:32,143 --> 00:04:35,751
and let’s call her… Sharon.

64
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:43,302
Now, Sharon,

65
00:04:43,944 --> 00:04:45,379
is getting an A.

66
00:04:46,208 --> 00:04:49,420
Now it seems to me that Randy is not only a hypocrite,

67
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:51,880
but also a candidate for dismissal.

68
00:05:02,748 --> 00:05:03,745
Discuss!

69
00:05:14,034 --> 00:05:18,025
So Coop, how great is it that you…
get to race cars for a living?

70
00:05:18,121 --> 00:05:21,825
Oh, you know; fame, money, extremely hot wives.

71
00:05:21,896 --> 00:05:24,233
-Ex-wives.
-Look who's talking.

72
00:05:24,575 --> 00:05:25,736
Check it out.

73
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:32,268
I’ll tell you what; there’s only
one view better than this one.

74
00:05:33,443 --> 00:05:34,441
That one.

75
00:05:42,594 --> 00:05:45,041
-This is Jeff Burton’s car.
-Yes it is.

76
00:05:45,710 --> 00:05:47,036
Hey, you guys wanna meet him?

77
00:05:48,078 --> 00:05:49,076
Hey Jeff!

78
00:05:49,704 --> 00:05:50,552
Hey Coop.

79
00:05:50,866 --> 00:05:54,474
-These two knuckleheads are fans of yours.
-Oh, is that right? How you guys doing?

80
00:05:54,529 --> 00:05:55,636
-Good.
-Good.

81
00:05:56,473 --> 00:06:00,108
-Hey, your car was really fast out there. Who’s driving it?
-That my crew chief, Ray Green.

82
00:06:00,166 --> 00:06:02,435
Oh, yeah, I know Ray, he’s a good man.

83
00:06:02,544 --> 00:06:05,018
-It’s a shame what happened.
-Yeah, it is.

84
00:06:05,223 --> 00:06:06,029
Look;

85
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:09,159
you guys stay out of trouble. I’ll see you in Darlington.
-You got it.

86
00:06:14,075 --> 00:06:16,371
So, Jeff Burton mentioned Ray Green.

87
00:06:16,412 --> 00:06:18,366
Isn’t he the guy that took
a swing at his team owner?

88
00:06:18,394 --> 00:06:20,348
Yeah, that team owner was my dad.

89
00:06:20,392 --> 00:06:22,552
He couldn’t get a sponsor
to touch him after that.

90
00:06:22,579 --> 00:06:26,994
I found him about five years ago down in Florida.
He was trying to drink all the scotch in South Beach!

91
00:06:27,072 --> 00:06:28,056
It was bourbon.

92
00:06:28,835 --> 00:06:29,833
It was bourbon.

93
00:06:30,724 --> 00:06:33,074
If I knew what a pain in the ass you
were gonna be, I woulda finished the job.

94
00:06:33,107 --> 00:06:39,134
Ray, let me ask you a question; I mean,
I’m not a real smart guy but if your not in
my car and I’m not in my car, who is?

95
00:06:39,558 --> 00:06:40,528
Hey, Tony?!

96
00:06:47,458 --> 00:06:48,688
No way.

97
00:06:50,547 --> 00:06:53,171
It’s still not right, dad; tight in, loose off.

98
00:06:54,336 --> 00:06:56,659
Nate, you remember my daughter, Daytona?

99
00:06:56,850 --> 00:06:58,244
You got your braces off.

100
00:06:58,613 --> 00:07:00,500
Yeah, like four years ago.

101
00:07:01,613 --> 00:07:05,016
-It's so good to see you.
-It's good to see you too.

102
00:07:28,209 --> 00:07:30,492
So, Daytona, how long’s it been since you’ve seen Nate?

103
00:07:30,806 --> 00:07:33,608
Well, I think, last time I saw
him, he was shorter than me.

104
00:07:33,644 --> 00:07:36,063
-By like half an inch.
-Whatever, shorty.

105
00:07:37,129 --> 00:07:41,161
Hey, hey, we don’t let visitors in here.
Uh-uh, this is all high tech,

106
00:07:41,256 --> 00:07:43,771
you know, complicated, secret stuff.

107
00:07:44,252 --> 00:07:45,058
Come on.

108
00:07:46,343 --> 00:07:49,733
So Lucas, this is my little brother; Garrett.

109
00:07:49,798 --> 00:07:52,600
-What's up?
-Hey, I’m Lucas; Nathan’s brother.

110
00:07:52,764 --> 00:07:56,496
-Hey. So, like, your mom’s Cooper’s sister?
-Oh, my mom slept with Cooper’s sister’s husband.

111
00:07:56,695 --> 00:07:59,812
OK. Whatever that means. Sounds messed up.

112
00:08:00,099 --> 00:08:01,124
It is.

113
00:08:02,111 --> 00:08:03,860
-So, you wanna hop in a car?
-Can I?

114
00:08:03,901 --> 00:08:05,159
-Yeah.
-Yeah, come on.

115
00:08:06,692 --> 00:08:09,672
-Wow, man, I ain’t seen you in forever.
-I know.

116
00:08:09,795 --> 00:08:11,380
How's that, uh,...

117
00:08:11,489 --> 00:08:13,184
marriage thing going?

118
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:15,344
Not so good.

119
00:08:16,207 --> 00:08:17,683
Oh, man, that sucks!

120
00:08:17,943 --> 00:08:21,127
-Yeah. Yeah, tell me about it.
-Oh, no, no, I mean,…

121
00:08:21,879 --> 00:08:25,856
you’re gonna be, like, divorced before…
I even get a girl to date me.

122
00:08:31,865 --> 00:08:33,177
What d’ya think, Luke?

123
00:08:34,147 --> 00:08:35,391
This is awesome!

124
00:08:35,817 --> 00:08:37,444
You guys wanna drive em?

125
00:08:37,662 --> 00:08:38,947
Are you serious?

126
00:08:39,965 --> 00:08:43,436
Take a crash course today.
You learn about the cars, the track.

127
00:08:43,682 --> 00:08:46,375
Spend the night, you can race tomorrow. How about it?

128
00:08:48,063 --> 00:08:49,512
Dude, I'm so there!

129
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:51,248
-Nathan?
-Yeah. Hell yeah!

130
00:08:51,343 --> 00:08:52,204
Me too?

131
00:08:52,781 --> 00:08:53,546
No.

132
00:08:55,883 --> 00:08:57,797
Andy, the man has to be stopped!

133
00:08:58,589 --> 00:09:01,760
Th-the fact that he would waltz
into your classroom and insinuate!

134
00:09:02,528 --> 00:09:03,963
You know something?

135
00:09:04,168 --> 00:09:08,487
I’m not sure how I was gonna tell Deb
about his little arrangement with Jules…

136
00:09:08,544 --> 00:09:12,836
Emily; whoever the hell she was but,
now, I hope Deb destroys him!

137
00:09:13,086 --> 00:09:15,601
Oh, uh, Peyton’s here. Ok, bye.

138
00:09:17,077 --> 00:09:18,020
Hi, Peyton.

139
00:09:18,458 --> 00:09:20,918
-How's Jake?
-Same.

140
00:09:22,129 --> 00:09:24,261
Is there anything I can do for you?

141
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,106
Sure.

142
00:09:26,339 --> 00:09:28,594
You can tell Brooke that I’m fine!

143
00:09:28,654 --> 00:09:30,963
Actually, I was a little worried about you, too.

144
00:09:31,045 --> 00:09:33,355
So we thought we’d all spend the day together.

145
00:09:34,054 --> 00:09:39,658
OK, I love you both, for all the caring but kind of…
creepy attention you’ve been giving me, but,…

146
00:09:39,887 --> 00:09:44,465
what’s wrong with wearing a little misery
now and then? This while thing sucks for Jake,

147
00:09:44,534 --> 00:09:45,299
and,...

148
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:48,471
why can’t I be bummed for a little bit, you know?

149
00:09:48,559 --> 00:09:54,094
You can totally be bummed; you just have
to do it with us and you have to do really
fun stuff while you’re bumming!

150
00:09:56,645 --> 00:09:57,930
How you doing…

151
00:09:58,449 --> 00:09:59,488
boozy?

152
00:09:59,611 --> 00:10:03,848
Great, actually. As a matter of fact,
I’m turning over a new leaf.

153
00:10:04,167 --> 00:10:07,912
From now on, I’m looking on the bright
side of things. Staying positive.

154
00:10:08,021 --> 00:10:10,400
Oh, Dan paid Jules to seduce Keith.

155
00:10:12,404 --> 00:10:14,467
Life sucks, I need a drink!

156
00:10:28,367 --> 00:10:29,542
Ok, so,

157
00:10:29,570 --> 00:10:31,811
you wanna enter turn one, high.

158
00:10:31,967 --> 00:10:34,469
And then…take this curve…

159
00:10:37,029 --> 00:10:38,752
So, uh, you got the new 50 Cent?

160
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:42,278
-Garrett, they need to pay attention.
-Yeah, yeah, I got that. He's pretty good.

161
00:10:42,338 --> 00:10:45,236
What’s up with Tony Yayo; is he
like in jail or out of jail, or what?

162
00:10:45,263 --> 00:10:49,158
Oh, Nathan, it’s great that you wanna talk
G-Unit hip-hop with my little brother,

163
00:10:49,286 --> 00:10:52,334
but,… if you make a mistake at 160 miles an hour,

164
00:10:52,444 --> 00:10:55,177
it’s gonna be a lot more than your heart that’s broken.

165
00:10:55,511 --> 00:10:56,564
Whatever!

166
00:10:56,933 --> 00:10:58,668
No girl’s gonna out-drive my, anyway.

167
00:10:59,857 --> 00:11:00,554
Ok.

168
00:11:08,729 --> 00:11:11,243
-I miss Nathan.
-I miss Keith.

169
00:11:11,476 --> 00:11:14,906
-I miss Jake.
-I don’t really miss Felix, at all.

170
00:11:15,019 --> 00:11:18,271
Or my parents that much. But I miss my money.

171
00:11:22,985 --> 00:11:27,112
-You know what I always do when I need to feel better?
-Drink?

172
00:11:28,971 --> 00:11:29,682
No.

173
00:11:30,707 --> 00:11:31,691
Dance.

174
00:11:33,566 --> 00:11:34,291
What?

175
00:11:48,782 --> 00:11:51,146
-Oh, Deb, no. I
-Shut up and dance.

176
00:12:01,293 --> 00:12:03,507
Come on, Karen. Dance to my divorce.

177
00:12:05,967 --> 00:12:07,922
Oh, hell, I can dance to that.

178
00:12:38,744 --> 00:12:39,386
So,

179
00:12:39,715 --> 00:12:42,080
the one thing that drives me crazy about home schooling

180
00:12:42,148 --> 00:12:45,756
is just, you know, getting behind
on all the fashions… and also,

181
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:50,054
every now and then, I like to,
you know, catch up on the gossip.
I don’t know, is that wrong of me?

182
00:12:50,272 --> 00:12:52,692
You might just… wanna…watch the track.

183
00:12:52,765 --> 00:12:55,895
Yeah, ok, Daytona, we get the point, alright?
You don’t need to get all crazy.

184
00:12:55,922 --> 00:12:57,781
Oh, you think this is crazy?

185
00:12:58,409 --> 00:12:59,257
No!

186
00:12:59,478 --> 00:13:01,337
This is crazy!

187
00:13:48,877 --> 00:13:51,529
So, a student reported my relationship with you.

188
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:55,267
I have to see the Dean,… tonight.

189
00:14:05,414 --> 00:14:07,793
Tell me you don’t live in a tent all year round.

190
00:14:07,945 --> 00:14:10,897
No, it’s just nice to get out under the stars sometimes.

191
00:14:11,157 --> 00:14:13,795
Plus, Garrett hates it, so, that’s a plus.

192
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:16,736
-You gonna play something?
-What d'ya wanna hear?

193
00:14:17,010 --> 00:14:17,966
NWA?

194
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:21,246
Maybe a little Tupac?

195
00:14:21,690 --> 00:14:22,838
Surprise us.

196
00:14:46,781 --> 00:14:48,845
What? It's Ryan Adams.

197
00:14:51,397 --> 00:14:53,775
-Did it suck that bad?
-No, it's...

198
00:14:54,213 --> 00:14:55,470
it's not that.

199
00:14:55,867 --> 00:14:57,411
It's...a Haley thing.

200
00:15:00,145 --> 00:15:01,470
I just..

201
00:15:01,716 --> 00:15:04,149
wish there was something I could do to help him.

202
00:15:05,095 --> 00:15:08,279
-What was he like when you were kids?
-He was..

203
00:15:09,332 --> 00:15:10,316
kind.

204
00:15:10,890 --> 00:15:14,279
Just a really… sweet guy.

205
00:15:15,223 --> 00:15:16,576
And a good friend...

206
00:15:17,273 --> 00:15:18,503
pre basketball.

207
00:15:20,198 --> 00:15:22,385
By the way, your marshmallow’s on fire.

208
00:15:25,244 --> 00:15:28,251
You know, Mrs. Scott, you really had a lot to drink.

209
00:15:28,713 --> 00:15:33,141
-Are you sure I can’t walk you to the door?
-Oh, no, I’m fine, thank you so much, Brooke.

210
00:15:35,697 --> 00:15:38,184
Say hi to your big, expensive house for me.

211
00:15:42,635 --> 00:15:44,220
Um, Ok, nighty night!

212
00:16:01,174 --> 00:16:02,212
Mouth?

213
00:16:03,552 --> 00:16:07,187
-I am so wasted!
-Why? What happened?

214
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:09,666
You know, I've just been..

215
00:16:09,776 --> 00:16:12,824
partying all night and, like, drinking!

216
00:16:13,966 --> 00:16:16,139
I can see that! Um,…

217
00:16:17,479 --> 00:16:18,845
let's get you home.

218
00:16:18,886 --> 00:16:20,814
No. No. No, no, no.

219
00:16:21,027 --> 00:16:23,405
I mean, we should drive around for a while because,

220
00:16:23,911 --> 00:16:24,827
you know,

221
00:16:25,032 --> 00:16:27,191
my parents are awhooo.

222
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:34,576
I totally get it, but I have to take you somewhere
coz I can only do one ride at a time.

223
00:16:34,705 --> 00:16:38,040
Are you sure, coz I am really messed
up on the hooch, you know?

224
00:16:38,833 --> 00:16:40,815
I’m sorry, Mouth, those are the rules.

225
00:16:40,861 --> 00:16:41,995
Ok, here's the deal,

226
00:16:42,064 --> 00:16:46,396
I’m not drunk, I… just… I knew your shift
was tonight and… I wanted to hang out.

227
00:16:48,181 --> 00:16:49,111
Sorry?

228
00:16:49,302 --> 00:16:52,459
You are so lucky I am lonely tonight!

229
00:16:52,569 --> 00:16:54,701
Hop up front.
-Score!

230
00:16:55,377 --> 00:16:57,850
-I can't believe you. Woa!
-I'm sorry.

231
00:17:01,737 --> 00:17:02,871
How'd it go?

232
00:17:03,924 --> 00:17:05,058
What'd he say?

233
00:17:06,431 --> 00:17:09,738
Well, the Dean presented me with two options;

234
00:17:11,249 --> 00:17:12,475
either I

235
00:17:12,686 --> 00:17:15,007
end the relationship or, uh,…

236
00:17:16,095 --> 00:17:17,245
I lose my job!

237
00:17:18,681 --> 00:17:21,177
-Well, there’s gotta be some way,
-So I quit.

238
00:17:21,856 --> 00:17:24,997
-Andy, you love teaching.
-Not as much as I love you.

239
00:17:29,678 --> 00:17:30,641
I'm so sorry.

240
00:17:31,179 --> 00:17:34,343
Yeah, it was a no-brainer, Karen.
There’ll be other teaching positions.

241
00:17:36,241 --> 00:17:38,397
But I hope there’s never another woman in my life.

242
00:18:01,808 --> 00:18:02,847
Erica?

243
00:18:04,054 --> 00:18:05,280
What happened?

244
00:18:06,429 --> 00:18:08,279
Oh, nothing really.

245
00:18:09,067 --> 00:18:12,077
I was hanging out with some
of the guys from Felix’s party, and…

246
00:18:12,697 --> 00:18:14,416
it just kinda got out of hand.

247
00:18:15,107 --> 00:18:17,406
-Out of hand how?
-Nothing major,...

248
00:18:17,813 --> 00:18:18,667
just

249
00:18:18,996 --> 00:18:20,244
grabby and...

250
00:18:22,203 --> 00:18:24,863
not what I excepted.
-Sure that’s all it was?

251
00:18:27,234 --> 00:18:28,909
I’m sorry those guys were like that.

252
00:18:33,918 --> 00:18:34,881
Thanks.

253
00:18:37,051 --> 00:18:39,338
I feel stupid for even calling, it’s just…

254
00:18:39,514 --> 00:18:40,926
I got scared and…

255
00:18:41,543 --> 00:18:42,846
I don’t know,

256
00:18:44,641 --> 00:18:45,779
disappointed.

257
00:18:49,101 --> 00:18:52,494
Well, I’m glad you called, because
we were just about to get some food.

258
00:18:53,821 --> 00:18:54,872
Yeah!

259
00:18:55,233 --> 00:18:57,028
What d’ya say, Marsh, you in?

260
00:18:57,339 --> 00:18:58,083
Ok.

261
00:18:59,090 --> 00:19:00,929
But, call me Erica.

262
00:19:06,959 --> 00:19:09,805
You know, when my wife left, I was a mess.

263
00:19:10,945 --> 00:19:12,478
You’re saying you’re not still a mess?

264
00:19:13,091 --> 00:19:15,105
I mean, you should have been; Kerry was…

265
00:19:15,151 --> 00:19:18,490
really hot.
-Yeah, well they usually are when they’re supermodels.

266
00:19:18,579 --> 00:19:20,495
And by the way, shut up!

267
00:19:20,868 --> 00:19:24,353
I had to let it all go, you know; the feeling that I wasn’t…

268
00:19:24,549 --> 00:19:26,518
good enough for Kerry…

269
00:19:27,379 --> 00:19:31,943
how much I resented the fact that
she wanted things besides me.

270
00:19:32,414 --> 00:19:34,382
I mean, it wasn’t fair to her.

271
00:19:34,874 --> 00:19:37,403
Hell, I wasn’t going to give up racing for her.

272
00:19:38,324 --> 00:19:39,608
I would have.

273
00:19:40,346 --> 00:19:43,148
I mean given up basketball for Haley.

274
00:19:44,425 --> 00:19:45,614
Kind of did.

275
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:48,402
Well you think…

276
00:19:49,241 --> 00:19:51,360
maybe that’s the reason she left?

277
00:19:52,562 --> 00:19:53,642
I mean,

278
00:19:53,833 --> 00:19:55,392
when you met her,

279
00:19:55,616 --> 00:19:57,243
would you have given it up then?

280
00:19:59,306 --> 00:20:00,687
No, probably not.

281
00:20:02,950 --> 00:20:06,559
Maybe your not the person she
fell in love with anymore, man.

282
00:20:06,602 --> 00:20:09,677
Maybe she’s not the person you thought she was.

283
00:20:11,088 --> 00:20:12,987
Look, I don’t say this…

284
00:20:13,384 --> 00:20:15,051
to hurt you, Nate, but…

285
00:20:16,383 --> 00:20:17,722
it's just...

286
00:20:18,501 --> 00:20:20,524
people change, you know?

287
00:20:24,386 --> 00:20:26,614
So after she left you, I mean,…

288
00:20:27,478 --> 00:20:29,419
was there ever a day when it…

289
00:20:29,487 --> 00:20:31,469
felt better?
-Sure,...

290
00:20:32,021 --> 00:20:35,738
followed by a day when it felt worse.
I mean, that’s just the way it goes!

291
00:20:35,895 --> 00:20:40,569
But I gotta tell ya, you’d be amazed at how
therapeutic two hundred miles an hour can be.

292
00:20:42,646 --> 00:20:43,849
I'll bet, man.

293
00:20:45,566 --> 00:20:47,357
Look, Nate,…

294
00:20:50,213 --> 00:20:52,509
love is a pretty great thing, man,

295
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:55,289
maybe it's the geatest thing.

296
00:20:56,532 --> 00:20:58,295
But it's gotta be true love...

297
00:20:59,450 --> 00:21:00,830
for the both of you.

298
00:21:02,675 --> 00:21:04,274
What if it was?

299
00:21:05,299 --> 00:21:06,721
What if it still is?

300
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:09,672
Well, if it still is, man, you fight like hell for it.

301
00:21:12,091 --> 00:21:14,278
But the harder question is:

302
00:21:15,290 --> 00:21:16,534
what if it wasn't?

303
00:21:18,258 --> 00:21:19,543
Trust me,...

304
00:21:20,254 --> 00:21:21,812
that one's a bitch.

305
00:21:35,209 --> 00:21:37,806
I think you’re on the wrong side of the desk, little man.

306
00:21:37,929 --> 00:21:39,720
I think you’re on the wrong side of me.

307
00:21:41,898 --> 00:21:44,973
I lost my teaching position tonight.
-Really?

308
00:21:45,191 --> 00:21:47,529
That’s terrible, what happened?

309
00:21:50,592 --> 00:21:53,039
-Do you have any faith, Dan?
-Faith?

310
00:21:53,171 --> 00:21:54,428
You know,...

311
00:21:54,988 --> 00:21:56,970
Do you believe in anything?

312
00:21:57,216 --> 00:21:58,187
God?

313
00:21:58,651 --> 00:21:59,786
Science?

314
00:22:00,705 --> 00:22:04,081
Karma?
-No. No, I don't believe in karma.

315
00:22:04,204 --> 00:22:07,498
But I do believe I’ll give you a chance
to remove yourself from my establishment…

316
00:22:07,963 --> 00:22:09,767
before I personally remove you.

317
00:22:17,426 --> 00:22:19,613
You know, we’re very different, you and I.

318
00:22:22,404 --> 00:22:24,645
See, I’m a big believer in karma.

319
00:22:24,869 --> 00:22:26,563
I think it's amazing how...

320
00:22:26,878 --> 00:22:29,857
most of the time, tragedy befalls whoever deserves it.

321
00:22:31,055 --> 00:22:33,187
You know, if you’re gonna threaten me, kid,…

322
00:22:33,378 --> 00:22:35,182
at least do it like a man.

323
00:22:36,481 --> 00:22:38,722
Karma finds us all in time, Dan.

324
00:22:39,015 --> 00:22:42,815
But, you know, I find that sometimes it helps
to just, you know, point it in the right direction.

325
00:22:47,658 --> 00:22:48,478
Wait.

326
00:22:52,858 --> 00:22:55,072
You should take a job application.

327
00:22:55,364 --> 00:22:57,988
I mean, now that you’re unemployed.

328
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:39,625
You know, an hour ago I wouldn’t have believe it but,…

329
00:23:39,761 --> 00:23:41,429
it’s turning out to be a pretty night.

330
00:23:42,003 --> 00:23:44,230
Thank you. For hanging out with me.

331
00:23:44,710 --> 00:23:45,995
You're welcome.

332
00:23:46,350 --> 00:23:49,493
We should get you home, though.
-Nah, I think I’ll walk.

333
00:23:49,657 --> 00:23:50,888
Are you sure?

334
00:23:51,879 --> 00:23:55,897
-Ok, well call if you need anything.
-I will. See ya!

335
00:23:57,852 --> 00:23:59,697
Hey, you wanna walk with me?

336
00:23:59,905 --> 00:24:02,966
-I’d love to but I have to finish my shift.
-I know.

337
00:24:03,089 --> 00:24:04,456
I meant you.

338
00:24:12,315 --> 00:24:15,418
I’m sorry, Brooke. Did you want me to
hang out with you for the rest of your shift?

339
00:24:15,464 --> 00:24:17,569
No, it's fine. You should go.

340
00:24:17,678 --> 00:24:18,812
Are you sure?

341
00:24:19,837 --> 00:24:21,491
Go get her Tiger.

342
00:24:31,807 --> 00:24:32,969
Hello?

343
00:24:34,998 --> 00:24:37,950
Hi. Is this the ‘safe rides’ programme?

344
00:24:38,544 --> 00:24:42,835
It sure is.
-Well, I was wondering if you could come pick me up.

345
00:24:43,122 --> 00:24:47,072
-Of course.
-Good. I would love to feel safe for a night.

346
00:24:47,938 --> 00:24:49,018
Thanks.

347
00:25:10,648 --> 00:25:12,684
Thanks for walking me home, Mouth.

348
00:25:12,999 --> 00:25:14,092
No problem.

349
00:25:14,673 --> 00:25:16,190
Thanks for inviting me.

350
00:25:20,582 --> 00:25:22,987
Well, I-I guess I’ll see ya.

351
00:25:23,056 --> 00:25:25,940
I loved what you said about Brooke during the campaign.

352
00:25:26,287 --> 00:25:28,583
Even though it’s pretty much the reason I lost.

353
00:25:29,007 --> 00:25:30,948
I suppose there’s no reason to…

354
00:25:31,513 --> 00:25:33,017
ask you out, then?

355
00:25:33,782 --> 00:25:35,641
Like… on a date?

356
00:25:36,658 --> 00:25:38,804
I was kinda pretending this was a date.

357
00:25:40,526 --> 00:25:41,551
Ok.

358
00:25:42,743 --> 00:25:44,328
Did we have fun?

359
00:25:44,888 --> 00:25:46,351
You tell me.

360
00:25:54,359 --> 00:25:58,199
I think we had a blast!
-We did.

361
00:25:59,584 --> 00:26:00,910
Good night.

362
00:26:07,396 --> 00:26:08,339
Yes!

363
00:26:56,783 --> 00:26:59,585
Alright, four cars, three laps.

364
00:27:00,312 --> 00:27:02,840
You can all talk in an open frequency in your helmets.

365
00:27:03,086 --> 00:27:05,410
Now if you get a little squirrelly out there,

366
00:27:05,621 --> 00:27:10,732
just take your foot off the gas downshift, and you either
come into the pits or pull the car in the inside apron.

367
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:17,696
There’s a tack in your car; tells you the RPM
when it hits 6, you’re up around 140 miles and hour.

368
00:27:17,819 --> 00:27:19,337
Nobody goes to 7?

369
00:27:20,553 --> 00:27:21,482
Got it?

370
00:27:23,229 --> 00:27:27,357
Alright, Garrett will lead you out in the pace car.
Garrett, don’t wreck the pace car.

371
00:27:28,272 --> 00:27:29,981
OK, may the best man win.

372
00:27:30,304 --> 00:27:32,436
Well that should eliminate you three girls.

373
00:27:38,873 --> 00:27:39,953
Good luck, Nate.

374
00:27:55,936 --> 00:27:57,275
Gentlemen!!

375
00:27:57,535 --> 00:27:58,492
Helloo!

376
00:27:59,003 --> 00:28:00,439
And beautiful ladies.

377
00:28:02,762 --> 00:28:04,648
Start your engines!

378
00:28:25,171 --> 00:28:26,934
This is stinking great!

379
00:28:33,388 --> 00:28:35,684
You sure you boys wanna be humiliated?

380
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,434
Notice he didn't say girl?

381
00:28:48,977 --> 00:28:51,014
Ready guys?
-Oh, yeah!

382
00:28:54,266 --> 00:28:56,194
Nathan?
-Let's do this!

383
00:29:28,657 --> 00:29:33,263
So, I was thinking, maybe I should just drive
in reverse for a while, you know, just to make it close.

384
00:29:44,131 --> 00:29:46,277
Nate, coming up on your left!

385
00:30:03,414 --> 00:30:06,762
So, what’s going on back here in the slow part of the world?

386
00:30:22,739 --> 00:30:24,680
Is that why Pokey left you?

387
00:30:36,272 --> 00:30:39,005
Alright, last lap, Nate. You better bring it.

388
00:30:41,370 --> 00:30:44,595
Ahhh, the low line is closed my friend.

389
00:30:46,088 --> 00:30:48,015
And the high side.

390
00:30:53,816 --> 00:30:57,903
Well, well, that was almost impressive,
even for a man like you.

391
00:31:09,079 --> 00:31:11,607
Looks like you got some competition out there, Cooper.

392
00:31:12,181 --> 00:31:14,067
Lock and load, Nate, he’s yours.

393
00:31:15,726 --> 00:31:17,011
You got him, Nate!

394
00:31:17,776 --> 00:31:19,512
Go chick time, nephew.

395
00:31:25,714 --> 00:31:29,924
Nathan, I love you but I sure hope
you bought a change of shorts.

396
00:31:38,272 --> 00:31:40,964
Oh no, Cooper, you did not just bump him!

397
00:31:45,539 --> 00:31:47,507
Rough as racing, Nathan!

398
00:31:51,525 --> 00:31:53,958
Looks like another chequered flag for me!

399
00:31:54,252 --> 00:31:56,193
Thank you very much.

400
00:31:57,273 --> 00:31:58,831
Good try, Nate.

401
00:31:59,104 --> 00:32:00,608
Nice run, guys.

402
00:32:01,802 --> 00:32:05,342
Tony, were you in second place or third from last?

403
00:32:06,168 --> 00:32:08,040
OK, bring it into the pits.

404
00:32:27,202 --> 00:32:28,187
Nathan,

405
00:32:28,433 --> 00:32:32,287
you not only missed your pit stall,
you just broke a half a dozen pit road rules.

406
00:32:35,786 --> 00:32:39,790
Nathan. That’s the first victory lap
I’ve ever seen for last place; I like it.

407
00:32:45,303 --> 00:32:47,121
Hey, Nate, you alright?

408
00:32:58,105 --> 00:32:59,253
Nathan?

409
00:32:59,271 --> 00:33:01,353
You reduce your speed and you come in!

410
00:33:01,371 --> 00:33:02,797
You know what I need Coop?

411
00:33:03,086 --> 00:33:05,771
Some of that two hundred mile
therapy we were talking about.

412
00:33:05,824 --> 00:33:06,489
Nathan...!

413
00:33:11,710 --> 00:33:13,835
Nobody goes past 7 on the tack, right?

414
00:33:14,766 --> 00:33:16,227
Let’s see about 8.

415
00:33:24,726 --> 00:33:26,563
Oh god, too fast!
-NATHAN!?

416
00:33:26,608 --> 00:33:27,868
You’re right, Coop,

417
00:33:28,375 --> 00:33:29,845
You’re right, Coop, this feels pretty damn good.

418
00:34:46,973 --> 00:34:51,172
Come one. Hold on, man. Hold on. Hold on, Nathan.

419
00:35:03,930 --> 00:35:07,875
I’ve got severe respiratory distress;
heart rate rapidly accelerating. Tachycardiac.

420
00:35:08,528 --> 00:35:09,991
You’ve been in an accident, son.

421
00:35:10,032 --> 00:35:12,328
You’re gonna be ok, Nate.
-Hey, we’re right here, buddy.

422
00:35:12,946 --> 00:35:15,065
-Promise me.
-Anything.

423
00:35:15,133 --> 00:35:16,336
Six units of blood.

424
00:35:16,910 --> 00:35:18,960
Don't call Haley.

425
00:35:36,367 --> 00:35:37,816
Well, well.

426
00:35:38,144 --> 00:35:40,399
It’s my wife; the lawn gnome.

427
00:35:42,372 --> 00:35:44,983
You gonna tell me where you were all night, Anna Nicole?

428
00:35:52,167 --> 00:35:55,912
We’re leaving again, are we?
-I know about what you did to Keith.

429
00:35:56,765 --> 00:35:57,790
I see.

430
00:35:58,555 --> 00:35:59,840
What's all this?

431
00:36:00,086 --> 00:36:02,642
I’m boiling water to throw on you.

432
00:36:05,911 --> 00:36:08,891
...And  what's ths syrup for?
-Oh, that’s so it sticks to you.

433
00:36:15,426 --> 00:36:18,146
I wish you would have died on
that floor in the beach house.

434
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:21,399
I went to the chapel and I prayed for you to die.

435
00:36:21,555 --> 00:36:25,546
That’s the kind of horrible, pathetic,
shell of a person I’ve become.

436
00:36:26,297 --> 00:36:27,678
But no more.

437
00:36:28,955 --> 00:36:31,032
I’m walking out that door, Dan,

438
00:36:31,169 --> 00:36:32,823
because if I don’t,…

439
00:36:33,375 --> 00:36:35,889
one of us is going to die soon.

440
00:36:46,686 --> 00:36:47,671
What?

441
00:36:52,099 --> 00:36:53,055
Lucas!

442
00:36:53,701 --> 00:36:56,243
Where’s Nathan? How is he?
-Deb, I'm so sorry.

443
00:36:56,311 --> 00:36:57,678
-Mrs Scott?
-Yes.

444
00:36:57,787 --> 00:37:02,421
Your son has had severe blunt trauma to his chest
and it was caused by a high speed collision.

445
00:37:02,819 --> 00:37:05,525
His right lung has collapsed and
he’s losing a great deal of blood.

446
00:37:05,569 --> 00:37:09,068
-Is he in surgery?
-we’re prepping him but the antigen in his blood,...

447
00:37:09,163 --> 00:37:11,419
it's rare.
-I’m the same, I’ll donate.

448
00:37:14,645 --> 00:37:16,681
You better pray it's ok.

449
00:37:34,964 --> 00:37:37,410
You oughta lock your front door, you know?

450
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:40,390
Some old crazy guy might come in here and get you.

451
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:44,290
Old crazy guys don’t scare me.

452
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:53,812
I know this is not really appropriate;
but Jake said that you wouldn’t answer
the door if I knocked so…

453
00:37:54,047 --> 00:37:57,218
I should just walk in.
-You've been to see him?

454
00:37:57,893 --> 00:37:58,863
I have.

455
00:38:02,132 --> 00:38:03,499
Do you mind if we...

456
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:04,893
sit down?
-Yeah,...

457
00:38:06,478 --> 00:38:07,490
The bed?

458
00:38:09,706 --> 00:38:12,522
The PTA’d have a field day with this!

459
00:38:14,772 --> 00:38:17,451
Have you ever...been to Florida, Peyton?

460
00:38:18,380 --> 00:38:20,116
Once, with my dad.

461
00:38:21,431 --> 00:38:24,765
There’s a little town… just off the Gulf of Mexico.

462
00:38:24,957 --> 00:38:28,333
Weather’s perfect year round; kinda like today.

463
00:38:29,730 --> 00:38:31,684
It's almost a paradise.

464
00:38:32,573 --> 00:38:34,896
It’s a great place to raise a child.

465
00:38:35,251 --> 00:38:39,420
Or, if you’re family, to protect
one till their daddy can arrive.

466
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:43,058
Jenny's fine, Peyton.

467
00:38:43,873 --> 00:38:45,855
Jake wanted you to know that.

468
00:38:49,397 --> 00:38:51,529
I went by to see him this morning…

469
00:38:53,025 --> 00:38:55,745
and he told me he didn’t want me to visit anymore.

470
00:38:55,950 --> 00:38:57,767
He said it was too hard.

471
00:39:00,424 --> 00:39:02,378
I can understand that.

472
00:39:04,517 --> 00:39:08,931
I know you miss your mom, honey.
Just like I miss my wife.

473
00:39:10,538 --> 00:39:11,385
But...

474
00:39:11,863 --> 00:39:13,572
think about Jake;

475
00:39:15,103 --> 00:39:17,795
he misses both women that he loves.

476
00:39:27,005 --> 00:39:29,124
Mr and Mrs Scott?
-Yes.

477
00:39:29,580 --> 00:39:31,015
Nathan is in surgery.

478
00:39:31,124 --> 00:39:34,186
We were able to locate an
additional supply of his blood type.

479
00:39:34,813 --> 00:39:37,273
He needed more than what I gave?

480
00:39:39,333 --> 00:39:42,518
Mrs. Scott, how long have you
been abusing prescription drugs?

481
00:39:42,903 --> 00:39:45,390
I’m sorry, your blood was unusable.

482
00:39:46,183 --> 00:39:47,536
Excuse me.

483
00:39:55,461 --> 00:39:56,513
Lucas!

484
00:40:01,098 --> 00:40:02,136
It's ok.

485
00:40:02,956 --> 00:40:04,501
I'm here for you.

486
00:40:14,134 --> 00:40:17,851
How long with the pills.
-Since I quit my job.

487
00:40:18,748 --> 00:40:19,869
Why?

488
00:40:20,826 --> 00:40:23,094
...Because I'm married to you.

489
00:40:51,755 --> 00:40:54,488
Look, man, I was just trying to help, alright?

490
00:40:56,654 --> 00:40:58,430
Dan. Calm down.

491
00:41:05,310 --> 00:41:07,306
There's your karma, Dan.

492
00:41:16,114 --> 00:41:17,918
He would have turned left.

493
00:41:18,014 --> 00:41:21,690
Nathan's an athlete; his reflexes would 
have been...to turn left.

494
00:41:23,633 --> 00:41:24,931
But, he didn't.

495
00:41:26,848 --> 00:41:28,393
It's almost like

496
00:41:29,923 --> 00:41:31,892
like he aimed for the wall.

497
00:41:32,096 --> 00:41:33,080
You know?

498
00:41:34,050 --> 00:41:35,020
Like...

499
00:41:35,553 --> 00:41:37,426
like he tried to crash.

500
00:41:40,851 --> 00:41:42,710
Stephen King once wrote:

501
00:41:42,945 --> 00:41:44,845
Time takes it all,…

502
00:41:45,255 --> 00:41:47,141
whether you want it to or not.

503
00:41:49,541 --> 00:41:51,140
Time takes it all,

504
00:41:51,673 --> 00:41:53,559
time bears it away,…

505
00:41:54,030 --> 00:41:57,091
and in the end… there is only darkness.

506
00:42:05,205 --> 00:42:08,471
Sometimes we find others in that darkness,…

507
00:42:15,244 --> 00:42:17,855
and sometime we lose them there again.
