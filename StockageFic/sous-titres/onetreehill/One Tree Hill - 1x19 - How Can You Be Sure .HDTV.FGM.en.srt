1
00:01:58,697 --> 00:02:00,774
What do you mean, you think?

2
00:02:01,091 --> 00:02:02,606
I mean I’m late.

3
00:02:03,718 --> 00:02:05,918
Like, late.

4
00:02:07,145 --> 00:02:08,628
Did you take a test?

5
00:02:10,518 --> 00:02:11,397
Okay.

6
00:02:12,602 --> 00:02:13,773
Okay, um.

7
00:02:15,157 --> 00:02:19,499
Look, we have to know, okay?

8
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:23,206
Maybe it’s a false alarm, you know?

9
00:02:23,895 --> 00:02:26,851
Come on. Drug Store’s still open.

10
00:02:28,352 --> 00:02:30,551
We’ll do it together. Okay?

11
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:38,650
Marry me.

12
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:46,990
I don’t know what to say.

13
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:48,820
Well, yes would be a good start.

14
00:02:51,787 --> 00:02:53,925
It just seems so out of the blue.

15
00:02:54,002 --> 00:02:55,324
After 15 years?

16
00:02:55,793 --> 00:02:58,293
Look, Karen, when you left for Italy we had a future.

17
00:03:00,081 --> 00:03:03,147
We’re still the same two people who stood at that airport.

18
00:03:03,874 --> 00:03:06,085
I was the man who was in love with you.

19
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:08,364
And I still am.

20
00:03:09,251 --> 00:03:10,647
I love you too, Keith.

21
00:03:11,558 --> 00:03:12,977
You’re my best friend.

22
00:03:13,689 --> 00:03:16,229
You’ve been a wonderful father figure for Lucas.

23
00:03:18,317 --> 00:03:23,421
But the time away, the distance, it gave me a new perspective.

24
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,978
- On us? 
- On everything.

25
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:29,171
Tree Hill is such a small part of the world.

26
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:33,605
And maybe it’s where I belong, but there’s so much more out there.

27
00:03:34,046 --> 00:03:38,797
Italy was the first time since Lucas was born that I’ve spent any time alone.

28
00:03:39,786 --> 00:03:42,904
I realized I only know my self as Lucas’ mother.

29
00:03:43,879 --> 00:03:46,098
I’ve got to find the rest of me.

30
00:03:48,812 --> 00:03:50,702
You mean the world to me, Keith.

31
00:03:54,578 --> 00:03:55,877
But I’m sorry.

32
00:03:57,906 --> 00:03:59,360
I can’t marry you.

33
00:04:12,279 --> 00:04:13,373
It’s positive.

34
00:04:16,368 --> 00:04:17,402
Oh my God.

35
00:04:24,929 --> 00:04:26,260
I’m pregnant.

36
00:04:34,699 --> 00:04:35,563
Come on.

37
00:04:39,025 --> 00:04:42,890
I know you’re still mad at me. Okay? But I’m here for you.

38
00:04:43,586 --> 00:04:46,797
Alright, we’ll go to the doctor tomorrow. In the city. I’ll take you.

39
00:04:46,892 --> 00:04:48,957
- I’ll take myself. 
- Brooke.

40
00:04:49,711 --> 00:04:53,745
I’m just as scared as you are. But I want to help.

41
00:04:55,352 --> 00:04:59,331
Please. Just, trust me.

42
00:04:59,837 --> 00:05:03,191
Yeah cause that worked out so well for me the last time.

43
00:05:24,334 --> 00:05:25,847
Hey you, wake up.

44
00:05:28,226 --> 00:05:29,791
- Hey.
- Hey.

45
00:05:30,318 --> 00:05:32,043
I didn’t even hear you come in.

46
00:05:32,425 --> 00:05:34,331
Well you didn’t hear your alarm clock either.

47
00:05:34,684 --> 00:05:39,594
That’s cause it didn’t go off. Everybody gets up at six. Geez.

48
00:05:39,958 --> 00:05:41,274
Well, time to get up.

49
00:05:42,646 --> 00:05:43,420
I am up.

50
00:05:44,586 --> 00:05:46,184
- Come here.
- Oh yeah?

51
00:05:54,115 --> 00:05:55,231
Oh, I’ll get that.

52
00:06:00,565 --> 00:06:03,495
You want me to start your shower?

53
00:06:03,736 --> 00:06:08,923
- Uh, yeah. Thanks. 
- Okay.

54
00:06:14,727 --> 00:06:15,613
So, what happened?

55
00:06:16,478 --> 00:06:19,305
The nurse said they’d call me in a few hours with the results,

56
00:06:19,392 --> 00:06:21,517
and then she asked me about the father.

57
00:06:22,410 --> 00:06:23,443
What did you say?

58
00:06:23,723 --> 00:06:26,658
I told her the sorry bro hoe kicked my ass to the curb.

59
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:30,569
God.

60
00:06:47,548 --> 00:06:50,942
So this whole thing with Haley really was just your way of messing with me, huh?

61
00:06:51,771 --> 00:06:53,200
What’s your problem now?

62
00:06:54,166 --> 00:06:56,425
I saw you making out with Peyton last night.

63
00:06:58,678 --> 00:07:02,908
Look, maybe you’re a little slow, but we kissed because it was the auction rules.

64
00:07:02,964 --> 00:07:03,947
I know what I saw.

65
00:07:07,583 --> 00:07:09,088
I’m about to beat your ass, man.

66
00:07:09,149 --> 00:07:12,226
I promised Haley I’d give you a break, that’s about the only thing that’s you right now.

67
00:07:12,401 --> 00:07:15,236
Look, I kissed Peyton like you kissed Haley. That’s it.

68
00:07:17,592 --> 00:07:19,194
What are you so tweaked about?

69
00:07:22,211 --> 00:07:24,582
Never mind. Sorry.

70
00:07:34,703 --> 00:07:35,717
What do you want, Nikki?

71
00:07:35,911 --> 00:07:37,237
I think we covered that.

72
00:07:40,437 --> 00:07:41,273
Let me hold her.

73
00:07:41,416 --> 00:07:46,906
No, no she’s tired. Peyton, could you take Jenny to her room for me, please?

74
00:07:47,003 --> 00:07:47,888
- Yeah.
- Thanks.

75
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:50,268
Is that your girlfriend?

76
00:07:51,010 --> 00:07:54,170
She’s just a friend, okay? She sits for Jenny sometimes.

77
00:07:54,241 --> 00:07:56,280
- Relax, I’m just asking. 
- Nikki...

78
00:07:56,494 --> 00:08:00,596
Listen, our little romantic outing to the grocery store got me thinking.

79
00:08:01,153 --> 00:08:05,244
You shouldn’t have to be using food stamps and paying for everything. I can help you.

80
00:08:05,346 --> 00:08:07,768
- I have some tuition money left over...
- I don’t want your money.

81
00:08:08,781 --> 00:08:10,318
Jake, this isn’t fair.

82
00:08:10,769 --> 00:08:14,004
Now you won’t let me be a part of my daughter’s life but you’ll hand her off to some babysitter?

83
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:17,573
Hey, Jenny loves Peyton. She’s got a lot of other people that care about her too.

84
00:08:17,624 --> 00:08:19,155
And none of those people are her mother.

85
00:08:23,911 --> 00:08:24,855
What are you looking at?

86
00:08:25,621 --> 00:08:26,625
You’re life.

87
00:08:27,767 --> 00:08:31,273
Yeah, that’s my life. You notice who’s not in it?

88
00:08:37,032 --> 00:08:39,508
Brooke, hold on. Still no news?

89
00:08:39,609 --> 00:08:40,705
Did I come find you?

90
00:08:41,417 --> 00:08:42,298
Well where are you going?

91
00:08:43,046 --> 00:08:44,505
Away from you.

92
00:08:44,597 --> 00:08:47,356
Hey, come on, you can’t cut me out of this. I’m just as worried as you are.

93
00:08:47,439 --> 00:08:50,654
Oh really? Or are you just worried that having a kid might deflate your market value?

94
00:08:51,089 --> 00:08:52,231
That’s not it.

95
00:08:52,395 --> 00:08:55,258
Oh that’s right you’re not on the market anymore. You’re a one woman kind of guy.

96
00:08:55,375 --> 00:08:57,474
Speaking of which, how is my former best friend?

97
00:08:57,539 --> 00:08:58,923
Peyton has nothing to do with this, okay?

98
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,444
Not yet. Maybe you can pull a Dan Scott and knock her up too.

99
00:09:02,496 --> 00:09:03,187
Brooke!

100
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:07,422
Or  maybe then you can move on to random bar-sluts. Oh wait you’ve already done that.

101
00:09:07,483 --> 00:09:10,556
Better be careful, Danny Jr., never know how many kids you’re going to end up with.

102
00:09:10,627 --> 00:09:11,779
Oh yeah, that’s real nice, Brooke.

103
00:09:11,871 --> 00:09:14,503
And by the way. It’s not like I’m the only guy you’ve ever slept with.

104
00:09:14,570 --> 00:09:15,517
What’s your point?

105
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:17,018
How do I even know it’s mine?

106
00:09:21,097 --> 00:09:23,529
It’s the doctor. Hello?

107
00:09:24,016 --> 00:09:25,265
Yeah, this is Brooke.

108
00:09:30,231 --> 00:09:33,175
Okay. Thank you.

109
00:09:35,151 --> 00:09:37,916
Trust me, it’s yours.

110
00:09:52,588 --> 00:09:55,562
Oh,  that reminds me.

111
00:09:57,939 --> 00:09:58,912
How did you get in here?

112
00:09:59,479 --> 00:10:00,452
Door was open.

113
00:10:01,118 --> 00:10:04,236
Why? Who were you expecting? Another high school boy with his pants around his ankles?

114
00:10:07,155 --> 00:10:08,087
What do you want, Dan?

115
00:10:08,153 --> 00:10:10,970
I want my son to come to his senses. Have you seen his apartment?

116
00:10:11,041 --> 00:10:12,648
Yeah, I dropped off some food.

117
00:10:12,909 --> 00:10:14,036
Did he ask you for any money?

118
00:10:14,139 --> 00:10:16,489
No, but I gave him some.

119
00:10:16,564 --> 00:10:20,061
Oh, that’s great. That’s great. Don’t you ever want him to come home?

120
00:10:20,129 --> 00:10:22,096
I want him home as much as you do.

121
00:10:22,173 --> 00:10:24,895
But for once in his life you need to let him make his own mistakes.

122
00:10:24,962 --> 00:10:27,859
Right, you bring him food and cash and I’m the one who needs to let him make his own mistakes.

123
00:10:27,917 --> 00:10:31,992
Oh and by the way, you can tell your friend Karen, her son was coming out of a family planning clinic.

124
00:10:32,044 --> 00:10:35,289
With a date. Is that the kind of mistake you had in mind for Nathan

125
00:10:43,409 --> 00:10:44,080
You hungry?

126
00:10:44,214 --> 00:10:45,657
Oh, I’m hungry for you.

127
00:10:45,934 --> 00:10:50,607
No I’m serious. We can heat something up, or go out and eat if you want to.

128
00:10:51,254 --> 00:10:52,073
What’s wrong?

129
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:53,926
Nothing, I’m just hungry.

130
00:10:55,113 --> 00:10:56,558
I don’t buy it. Talk to me.

131
00:10:56,773 --> 00:10:59,072
I just don’t feel like making out, that’s all.

132
00:10:59,144 --> 00:11:01,807
You realize you just said that, right? Since when?

133
00:11:03,465 --> 00:11:05,810
Since you got my jersey number tattooed on your ass.

134
00:11:06,911 --> 00:11:11,144
Oh. Above my ass, actually.

135
00:11:12,185 --> 00:11:13,233
When did you see that?

136
00:11:13,530 --> 00:11:14,345
This morning.

137
00:11:17,259 --> 00:11:18,425
Does that bother you?

138
00:11:18,728 --> 00:11:20,156
I’m just confused as hell.

139
00:11:20,519 --> 00:11:23,080
I mean you’ll do something that permanent, but you won’t have sex with me?

140
00:11:24,114 --> 00:11:26,096
You can get a tattoo removed, Nathan.

141
00:11:26,649 --> 00:11:29,915
- Sex is a really big deal for me. 
- I get that.

142
00:11:30,033 --> 00:11:33,145
- That’s why I haven’t been pressuring you into it.
- The way you’re not pressuring me right now.

143
00:11:37,374 --> 00:11:38,624
I’m going to heat up some food.

144
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:47,660
- Brooke. 
- I’m busy.

145
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:51,230
Look, don’t shut me out on this, okay? We can deal with it together.

146
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:54,800
We’re not together, remember? You dodged the bullet just in time.

147
00:12:00,826 --> 00:12:04,999
Hey. Nathan told me about the fantasy kiss scenario you thought you saw.

148
00:12:05,076 --> 00:12:05,876
Were you high?

149
00:12:06,908 --> 00:12:09,536
The kiss didn’t mean anything, I wouldn’t do that to Haley.

150
00:12:09,829 --> 00:12:12,987
Yeah, I guess I overreacted.

151
00:12:16,239 --> 00:12:18,020
- She’s gone, you know.
- Huh?

152
00:12:18,164 --> 00:12:19,449
- Brooke.
- What?

153
00:12:19,541 --> 00:12:20,953
Why do you assume I’m looking for Brooke?

154
00:12:21,143 --> 00:12:24,554
Because you are. She still freezing you out?

155
00:12:24,717 --> 00:12:26,659
- Yeah, sort of. 
- Me too.

156
00:12:27,329 --> 00:12:28,501
Do you want to talk about it?

157
00:12:29,063 --> 00:12:31,532
I think I’ve screwed things up enough as it is.

158
00:12:31,599 --> 00:12:34,339
- Yeah, me too.
- And worse than that.

159
00:12:34,875 --> 00:12:38,245
What? Worse than the death wish best friend love triangle?

160
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:40,226
What’d you do? Tell her she was fat?

161
00:12:41,675 --> 00:12:44,322
Okay look she’s pissed at me too but she’s still my friend.

162
00:12:44,604 --> 00:12:45,551
What’s going on?

163
00:12:46,841 --> 00:12:48,521
What were we thinking, Peyton?

164
00:12:48,951 --> 00:12:51,527
You and me, or you and Brooke?

165
00:12:51,936 --> 00:12:52,811
All of us.

166
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:57,849
I guess we weren’t.

167
00:13:13,409 --> 00:13:15,821
I like that. What color is it?

168
00:13:16,055 --> 00:13:16,784
Shag.

169
00:13:20,004 --> 00:13:21,924
Did Nathan ever cheat on you?

170
00:13:23,373 --> 00:13:24,694
Where’d that come from?

171
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:31,589
I just wonder if, maybe he’s going to start looking somewhere else for what he’s not getting from me.

172
00:13:31,699 --> 00:13:34,191
Hm, the big bad sex issue.

173
00:13:36,061 --> 00:13:36,650
Yeah.

174
00:13:38,134 --> 00:13:42,285
I mean, we start making out, and it’s great,

175
00:13:42,364 --> 00:13:47,386
and I totally get into him, and then I just hit this point.

176
00:13:47,462 --> 00:13:48,579
I bet he loves that.

177
00:13:49,352 --> 00:13:54,467
Yeah. I guess I just always thought I would wait until I fell in love,

178
00:13:54,533 --> 00:14:00,181
and got married, and then I met Nathan and everything got really confusing.

179
00:14:00,775 --> 00:14:03,764
It was never something I had to deal with right away, it was always a few years off.

180
00:14:03,841 --> 00:14:05,629
- And then all of a sudden…
- It wasn’t?

181
00:14:06,913 --> 00:14:08,234
I’ve been down that road.

182
00:14:09,053 --> 00:14:10,662
I don’t know if I’m ready, Peyton.

183
00:14:10,862 --> 00:14:13,362
Or maybe you’re just not sure if Nathan’s the right guy.

184
00:14:13,662 --> 00:14:17,046
No, I’m... I can safely rule that out. He...

185
00:14:18,107 --> 00:14:21,884
I can’t breath when I’m around him and when I’m not around him I want to be.

186
00:14:21,950 --> 00:14:24,001
I’m just, I’m totally in love with him.

187
00:14:24,848 --> 00:14:28,172
Well then you’ve gone further with him than I ever did.

188
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:44,311
Be careful with those knees.

189
00:14:45,258 --> 00:14:46,385
Trust me, I know.

190
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:51,863
I also know what it’s like to be sidelined with an injury.

191
00:14:52,897 --> 00:14:55,262
I wouldn’t wish it on anyone who’s serious about their game.

192
00:14:56,998 --> 00:14:57,930
How’s the shoulder?

193
00:14:59,866 --> 00:15:00,812
Fine.

194
00:15:01,473 --> 00:15:02,405
Good.

195
00:15:04,776 --> 00:15:07,187
You know, I saw you at the clinic the other day with that girl.

196
00:15:09,583 --> 00:15:13,300
I don’t have to tell you, you’re turning into my area of expertise.

197
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:18,436
You know, Lucas, one day I woke up and I was looking down the barrel of a life I couldn’t control.

198
00:15:20,367 --> 00:15:22,485
Maybe you find yourself in the same situation.

199
00:15:24,057 --> 00:15:25,787
I just thought you could use some advice.

200
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:30,200
I  can see that you’re scared.

201
00:15:31,518 --> 00:15:33,433
But don’t let that fear cloud your vision.

202
00:15:34,332 --> 00:15:35,987
You know I asked your mom to get an abortion.

203
00:15:36,524 --> 00:15:38,558
She said no. She was too emotional.

204
00:15:39,411 --> 00:15:43,171
If she was thinking clearly, she would have done what I said.

205
00:15:44,937 --> 00:15:47,113
So your advice is to have an abortion.

206
00:15:48,587 --> 00:15:51,116
The way you would have aborted me.

207
00:15:53,597 --> 00:15:56,601
You’ve got a lot of life yet to live, Lucas.

208
00:15:56,662 --> 00:15:59,292
Don’t let this girl make the same mistake your mother made.

209
00:15:59,447 --> 00:16:02,924
Cause if you do, you’ll be paying for it until the day you die.

210
00:16:15,019 --> 00:16:16,531
I’m glad you came by, Keith.

211
00:16:16,608 --> 00:16:20,171
I’ve been so caught up in my own problems, we haven’t had a chance to catch up.

212
00:16:23,377 --> 00:16:25,204
Well you might as well hear it here.

213
00:16:26,259 --> 00:16:27,616
I asked Karen to marry me.

214
00:16:28,668 --> 00:16:29,597
What?

215
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:34,615
She said no.

216
00:16:34,734 --> 00:16:39,003
Oh, Keith I’m so sorry.

217
00:16:39,358 --> 00:16:41,876
You know, you never picture it.

218
00:16:42,623 --> 00:16:46,412
You run it through your mind a thousand times over fifteen years.

219
00:16:47,667 --> 00:16:51,102
You know how the moment will feel when your love agrees to be your wife.

220
00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:53,975
But you never see her saying no.

221
00:16:56,292 --> 00:16:59,228
Well, you’re still an important part of her life.

222
00:16:59,654 --> 00:17:02,147
That won’t change. She needs you.

223
00:17:02,505 --> 00:17:03,759
Well maybe she needs me.

224
00:17:04,779 --> 00:17:06,094
But she doesn’t want me.

225
00:17:07,528 --> 00:17:08,566
I’m sorry.

226
00:17:10,328 --> 00:17:11,506
What did Lucas say?

227
00:17:12,837 --> 00:17:14,778
I don’t even know if she’s told him yet.

228
00:17:28,808 --> 00:17:30,117
Dad.

229
00:17:31,048 --> 00:17:33,481
Ohh. Looks like I missed the party.

230
00:17:33,977 --> 00:17:36,896
You weren’t invited. You should have called.

231
00:17:36,984 --> 00:17:38,785
Why? You don’t call back.

232
00:17:39,291 --> 00:17:42,829
I had to run a credit check to get your address. Your mother wouldn’t give it to me.

233
00:17:43,459 --> 00:17:45,898
Hey. You think you’re ready for this?

234
00:17:46,348 --> 00:17:49,902
I’ve got news for you, son. Playing house costs a lot of money.

235
00:17:50,238 --> 00:17:51,521
Okay, so I‘ll get a job.

236
00:17:51,617 --> 00:17:53,634
Oh great, what’s that going to do to your game?

237
00:17:54,689 --> 00:17:58,304
It’s okay to be irrational every once and a while. But have you thought this thing through?

238
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:00,362
I give you a week out in the real world.

239
00:18:00,515 --> 00:18:03,225
You know what the best part about having my own place is, dad?

240
00:18:04,115 --> 00:18:06,311
- I can ask you to leave. 
- Fine.

241
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:09,912
But the beach house will be there for you when you hit rock bottom.

242
00:18:11,257 --> 00:18:12,354
And you will.

243
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:20,945
Who are you calling?

244
00:18:22,097 --> 00:18:23,003
Jake, maybe?

245
00:18:24,529 --> 00:18:30,212
Look, I know you baby-sit Jenny but, I’m back now, so Jake and I won’t be needing you anymore.

246
00:18:30,509 --> 00:18:32,951
Oh, and if there’s anything going on between you and Jake,

247
00:18:33,345 --> 00:18:35,372
well you’re not going to be a permanent part of my daughter’s life,

248
00:18:35,454 --> 00:18:38,179
so if I were you I wouldn’t get too attached.

249
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,994
If I were you, I would walk away.

250
00:18:41,928 --> 00:18:44,026
You have to know you’re temporary, right?

251
00:18:44,405 --> 00:18:47,163
I mean, all the babysitting in the world isn’t going to make you Jenny’s mother.

252
00:18:48,071 --> 00:18:51,855
All the eyeliner in the world wont make you anything other than a psycho stalker bitch.

253
00:19:04,547 --> 00:19:05,439
Friend of yours?

254
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:07,548
It’s Jake’s ex.

255
00:19:08,081 --> 00:19:11,833
All of a sudden she’s trying to deal with her issues and I think I’m one of them.

256
00:19:12,134 --> 00:19:13,057
Scary.

257
00:19:14,822 --> 00:19:16,163
So you’re talking to me?

258
00:19:17,009 --> 00:19:17,909
Yeah.

259
00:19:19,359 --> 00:19:22,713
There’s some stuff going on and I don’t know what to do.

260
00:19:23,726 --> 00:19:26,158
I screwed up, I can’t even say it.

261
00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:30,598
Is it about Lucas? Cause he was really upset yesterday.

262
00:19:30,756 --> 00:19:32,466
I thought you and Lucas weren’t together.

263
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:34,812
No, we’re not. We were just, um...

264
00:19:34,873 --> 00:19:38,467
You know what, for get it, Peyton. You are the last person I should be talking to.

265
00:19:42,322 --> 00:19:43,161
Damn.

266
00:19:43,726 --> 00:19:45,272
Yeah, I didn’t want to tell anybody but...

267
00:19:45,338 --> 00:19:48,754
Hey, I didn’t want to tell anybody either but I felt a lot better after I did.

268
00:19:49,301 --> 00:19:50,413
What does Brooke want to do?

269
00:19:52,946 --> 00:19:55,337
I don’t know. She won’t talk to me.

270
00:19:55,476 --> 00:19:56,571
What do you want her to do?

271
00:19:57,002 --> 00:19:58,097
How do I answer that?

272
00:19:59,802 --> 00:20:01,926
I’m just walking around like a zombie right now.

273
00:20:04,088 --> 00:20:05,982
I guess I want whatever’s best for her.

274
00:20:06,182 --> 00:20:07,687
Does she think she’s going to have it?

275
00:20:08,814 --> 00:20:12,055
You know, Nikki and I, we talked about not keeping the baby.

276
00:20:12,115 --> 00:20:13,724
Yeah, so did Dan and my mom.

277
00:20:14,963 --> 00:20:16,755
But how screwed up is that, huh?

278
00:20:17,871 --> 00:20:20,446
If she had listened to him I wouldn’t be standing here right now.

279
00:20:23,513 --> 00:20:29,913
Well, Luke, I don’t want to lie to you. If Brooke has this kid, you’re life, it’s going to change.

280
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:31,704
Where’s your head at?

281
00:20:31,874 --> 00:20:34,511
My head says we’re not ready to be parents yet.

282
00:20:35,571 --> 00:20:38,950
I can’t even take care of myself. Plus there’s college.

283
00:20:39,028 --> 00:20:41,111
Not just for me but for Brooke, too.

284
00:20:42,632 --> 00:20:44,751
God, my mom is going to freak out.

285
00:20:50,423 --> 00:20:51,151
Hey.

286
00:20:51,351 --> 00:20:52,053
Hey.

287
00:20:55,497 --> 00:20:56,389
Are you kidding?

288
00:20:57,024 --> 00:20:59,482
I’ve got to sell the car to pay for the apartment.

289
00:20:59,543 --> 00:21:00,838
What is your dad going to say?

290
00:21:01,401 --> 00:21:03,813
He can say whatever he wants, it’s still my car.

291
00:21:03,961 --> 00:21:08,332
You know, if you need some extra money I could always be your sugar mama.

292
00:21:14,473 --> 00:21:15,379
What’s wrong?

293
00:21:17,706 --> 00:21:19,260
Nothing, it’s just I’m...

294
00:21:20,401 --> 00:21:22,671
You said you weren’t ready so I’m trying to respect that.

295
00:21:22,737 --> 00:21:24,041
So we can’t even kiss now?

296
00:21:24,344 --> 00:21:26,879
No, I’m just trying to make you comfortable.

297
00:21:31,122 --> 00:21:34,320
I’m sorry, Nathan, I know this is so not fair to you.

298
00:21:34,455 --> 00:21:37,653
No. Actually it’s not fair to you.

299
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:42,321
- I just... 
- Just, don’t apologize, okay?

300
00:22:10,808 --> 00:22:11,772
M om?

301
00:22:12,621 --> 00:22:14,925
Hey. Did I wake you?

302
00:22:15,394 --> 00:22:16,236
No.

303
00:22:16,471 --> 00:22:20,368
Sometimes I can’t sleep. I just lie awake and worry.

304
00:22:21,101 --> 00:22:22,222
What are you worried about?

305
00:22:22,903 --> 00:22:25,789
I’m a mother, Lucas. I worry about everything.

306
00:22:27,004 --> 00:22:28,258
What are you doing up?

307
00:22:28,995 --> 00:22:30,775
There’s something I have to tell you.

308
00:22:33,977 --> 00:22:35,094
You should sit.

309
00:22:36,082 --> 00:22:36,854
Okay.

310
00:22:41,817 --> 00:22:43,571
I think I’ll stand.

311
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:46,707
This is going to hurt you, mom. And I’m sorry.

312
00:22:46,806 --> 00:22:47,881
What happened?

313
00:22:49,509 --> 00:22:50,670
Brooke’s pregnant.

314
00:22:54,778 --> 00:22:56,144
Oh my God, Lucas, I’m sorry.

315
00:22:56,523 --> 00:22:57,767
I guess I deserved that.

316
00:22:58,330 --> 00:22:59,212
Lucas.

317
00:23:00,916 --> 00:23:03,911
Look, I didn’t mean it Lucas.

318
00:23:04,530 --> 00:23:07,228
- I’m pretty sure you did.
- No, I didn’t! It’s just that...

319
00:23:08,405 --> 00:23:12,933
Do you understand? This is exactly what I didn’t want for you.

320
00:23:13,542 --> 00:23:19,553
Have I been talking to my self the last few years? You have so much left to do in life.

321
00:23:20,101 --> 00:23:21,340
So does Brooke.

322
00:23:22,691 --> 00:23:25,471
Oh God, you’re both just too young for this.

323
00:23:25,790 --> 00:23:26,915
Don’t cry, mom.

324
00:23:28,032 --> 00:23:30,314
It’s just that I’m scared for you.

325
00:23:32,502 --> 00:23:35,235
I cannot believe that this is happening.

326
00:23:42,030 --> 00:23:45,220
How close was I to not existing?

327
00:23:48,494 --> 00:23:50,934
Dan wanted to have an abortion, mom.

328
00:23:52,398 --> 00:23:54,185
Why didn’t you listen to him?

329
00:23:57,386 --> 00:24:03,313
Because I realized that I wanted you in my future.

330
00:24:08,388 --> 00:24:09,564
What does Brooke want?

331
00:24:11,506 --> 00:24:12,679
I don’t know.

332
00:24:14,312 --> 00:24:15,985
Oh she must be so scared.

333
00:24:19,110 --> 00:24:20,083
Lucas.

334
00:24:21,658 --> 00:24:22,995
What are we going to do?

335
00:24:27,972 --> 00:24:32,129
Alright, hot off the grill, my friend. I super sized it.

336
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:33,307
Not hungry.

337
00:24:35,115 --> 00:24:36,435
Alright, more for me.

338
00:24:39,293 --> 00:24:43,220
So, uh, I’ve got to ask you kind of a personal question.

339
00:24:44,285 --> 00:24:45,421
Just out of curiosity.

340
00:24:46,255 --> 00:24:49,379
How many times per minute do guys think about sex?

341
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,448
- Per minute?
- Yeah.

342
00:24:54,505 --> 00:24:58,636
Elle magazine said that guys think about sex like every, 30 seconds.

343
00:25:00,612 --> 00:25:02,040
You’re thinking about having sex with him.

344
00:25:02,128 --> 00:25:02,804
Shh.

345
00:25:03,429 --> 00:25:04,191
Sorry.

346
00:25:04,585 --> 00:25:08,573
Look, it just keeps coming up. And...

347
00:25:10,832 --> 00:25:12,445
Sorry. Wrong words.

348
00:25:13,028 --> 00:25:13,818
Look,

349
00:25:15,999 --> 00:25:18,517
it’s not my place to tell you how to live your life, Hales.

350
00:25:19,475 --> 00:25:20,867
But for what it’s worth,

351
00:25:22,214 --> 00:25:23,796
I wish I would have waited.

352
00:25:24,088 --> 00:25:24,820
Really?

353
00:25:24,968 --> 00:25:28,937
All I’m saying, is just look past the moment.

354
00:25:31,256 --> 00:25:34,472
If you’re not ready, then just wait.

355
00:25:36,038 --> 00:25:36,837
Okay?

356
00:25:48,658 --> 00:25:50,323
I didn’t hear you come in.

357
00:25:51,552 --> 00:25:52,791
I didn’t make any noise.

358
00:25:53,566 --> 00:25:58,710
Your father stopped by, he wanted you address but I wouldn’t give it to him.

359
00:25:59,196 --> 00:26:00,875
- He found me anyway.
- Sorry.

360
00:26:03,728 --> 00:26:09,069
Nathan, you can come home anytime, you know that right?

361
00:26:10,093 --> 00:26:11,494
I’m still here.

362
00:26:11,848 --> 00:26:13,057
I don’t want to come home.

363
00:26:16,630 --> 00:26:22,374
You know, I walk around this empty house and it doesn’t seem real.

364
00:26:22,744 --> 00:26:24,982
I wish I could go back and do things differently.

365
00:26:25,831 --> 00:26:27,408
I need to ask you a question.

366
00:26:27,991 --> 00:26:28,791
Okay.

367
00:26:31,867 --> 00:26:33,128
Why’d you do it?

368
00:26:33,664 --> 00:26:35,806
- What?
- Cheat on dad.

369
00:26:38,074 --> 00:26:40,494
I was confused.

370
00:26:41,711 --> 00:26:46,378
We were married so young and suddenly I was a wife

371
00:26:46,445 --> 00:26:48,963
and a mother before I was my own person.

372
00:26:49,055 --> 00:26:52,035
But when we grew up, we grew apart.

373
00:26:52,097 --> 00:26:54,964
Why, mom? Why did you guys grow apart?

374
00:26:55,103 --> 00:26:56,746
I wish I knew, Nathan.

375
00:26:58,018 --> 00:27:01,303
But none of that makes what I did right.

376
00:27:01,370 --> 00:27:02,449
Cause you were married?

377
00:27:02,710 --> 00:27:08,942
Because I had a commitment to him. And to you.

378
00:27:09,244 --> 00:27:16,207
Those moments of what I mistook for happiness weren’t worth the cost of hurting someone I loved.

379
00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:20,528
And losing you over it now.

380
00:27:28,861 --> 00:27:29,537
Nikki?

381
00:27:29,865 --> 00:27:30,693
Hey, stranger.

382
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:34,703
How’d you find me?

383
00:27:35,006 --> 00:27:39,086
I found out you were on Jake’s basketball team, after that it didn’t take a private eye.

384
00:27:39,209 --> 00:27:40,242
Oh, you know Jake?

385
00:27:40,370 --> 00:27:41,451
Pretty well, actually.

386
00:27:43,336 --> 00:27:44,712
Jenny’s my daughter.

387
00:27:47,441 --> 00:27:48,675
Small world, huh?

388
00:27:49,511 --> 00:27:53,995
Oh, look, Jake’s a good friend, okay? I had no idea.

389
00:27:54,058 --> 00:27:56,786
And neither did I and that’s why I don’t want you to say anything.

390
00:27:56,838 --> 00:27:58,185
I didn’t know who you were.

391
00:27:59,203 --> 00:28:04,670
Lucas, I’m trying to get my family back together, and it’s not going so well.

392
00:28:06,433 --> 00:28:11,808
Remember that night? What you told me about your dad? How you feel about him?

393
00:28:13,519 --> 00:28:16,518
I don’t want Jenny to ever say the same thing about me.

394
00:28:17,825 --> 00:28:20,743
I still have a chance to correct my mistake, Lucas.

395
00:28:22,386 --> 00:28:24,684
Please, don’t say anything.

396
00:28:34,542 --> 00:28:35,365
Keith?

397
00:28:37,947 --> 00:28:39,087
Hey, Luke.

398
00:28:39,538 --> 00:28:40,178
Hey.

399
00:28:40,711 --> 00:28:43,905
I called you a couple of times. How’ve you been?

400
00:28:43,967 --> 00:28:46,880
Nah, I’m good, it’s just, I’ve been dealing with some stuff.

401
00:28:46,932 --> 00:28:47,735
Yeah, me too.

402
00:28:49,494 --> 00:28:52,612
It’s really good to see you. How’s the rehab going?

403
00:28:52,768 --> 00:28:57,074
Oh, it’s good. It’s good. It should be ready for the playoffs.

404
00:28:57,182 --> 00:28:58,263
Yeah, you look a lot better.

405
00:28:59,634 --> 00:29:00,479
Sit down.

406
00:29:02,004 --> 00:29:03,091
How’s everything else?

407
00:29:05,788 --> 00:29:07,468
Like what?

408
00:29:07,564 --> 00:29:10,560
Like the rest of your life. What’s going on?

409
00:29:11,806 --> 00:29:13,443
There’s something I wanted to ask you.

410
00:29:13,653 --> 00:29:14,432
Sure.

411
00:29:15,010 --> 00:29:18,875
When my mom got pregnant, and Dan left,

412
00:29:20,264 --> 00:29:23,996
why didn’t you? Why’d you stand by her?

413
00:29:24,733 --> 00:29:27,928
Well, it was the right thing to do.

414
00:29:28,890 --> 00:29:33,672
And I loved her, and I wanted to protect her.

415
00:29:34,088 --> 00:29:36,929
But, she really didn’t need it.

416
00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:39,074
She’s pretty tough, huh?

417
00:29:39,365 --> 00:29:41,439
Your mom could have been anything in this life.

418
00:29:41,516 --> 00:29:42,939
Yeah, if it wasn’t for me.

419
00:29:43,969 --> 00:29:49,943
Luke, you’re the best thing that ever happened to your mom. Trust me.

420
00:29:50,508 --> 00:29:54,940
Look, Keith, I just wanted to apologize.

421
00:29:55,555 --> 00:29:59,727
For the way I acted when my mom was in Italy. Brooke and all.

422
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:04,781
That’s water under the bridge. No damage done, right?

423
00:30:07,081 --> 00:30:07,776
Right.

424
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:14,392
I should take off.

425
00:30:15,610 --> 00:30:16,329
Yeah.

426
00:30:18,130 --> 00:30:19,139
Uh, Luke.

427
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:22,671
You know I’m proud of you, right?

428
00:30:23,746 --> 00:30:24,494
Sure.

429
00:30:25,057 --> 00:30:26,640
And I’ll always be there for you.

430
00:30:27,227 --> 00:30:30,469
You know, even if I’m not around as much.

431
00:30:31,575 --> 00:30:32,631
Yeah, I know.

432
00:30:34,315 --> 00:30:38,400
- Is everything okay? 
- Yeah, everything’s good.

433
00:30:39,706 --> 00:30:41,544
- Okay.
- Alright, I’ll see you.

434
00:30:42,389 --> 00:30:43,095
See ya.

435
00:30:52,846 --> 00:30:55,245
- Nathan, I know I’m driving you crazy.
- No you’re not.

436
00:30:55,302 --> 00:30:56,873
- Do you think that I’m a tease?
- Stop it.

437
00:30:56,944 --> 00:30:57,923
Well what do you think?

438
00:30:58,752 --> 00:31:01,860
I think that you’re my girlfriend, and I like to spend time with you.

439
00:31:04,610 --> 00:31:06,110
Look I just don’t want to push you.

440
00:31:07,006 --> 00:31:09,048
- You’re not.
- But I am.

441
00:31:10,293 --> 00:31:12,883
Haley, you got a tattoo for god sakes.

442
00:31:13,888 --> 00:31:16,688
It just freaks me out a little bit,

443
00:31:16,764 --> 00:31:20,466
because obviously this whole thing with us means a lot to you.

444
00:31:22,933 --> 00:31:26,349
I just don’t want to do anything to pressure you.

445
00:31:26,877 --> 00:31:28,096
Or drive you away.

446
00:31:29,406 --> 00:31:31,310
Even though sometimes I can’t help it.

447
00:31:33,343 --> 00:31:35,786
Just like I can’t help that I fell in love with you.

448
00:31:36,906 --> 00:31:37,783
Cause I did.

449
00:31:42,938 --> 00:31:44,431
I love you, Haley.

450
00:31:46,886 --> 00:31:48,299
And it scares me, a little bit,

451
00:31:48,355 --> 00:31:51,862
but, there it is.

452
00:31:53,987 --> 00:31:58,042
Wow. There it is.

453
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:09,444
I love you too.

454
00:32:31,851 --> 00:32:33,436
- Something I can help you with? 
- Not really.

455
00:32:34,828 --> 00:32:38,122
I just wanted to thank you for filling in some of the blanks for me about how you felt

456
00:32:38,199 --> 00:32:40,557
- when my mom got pregnant. 
- Glad to be of help.

457
00:32:44,828 --> 00:32:46,344
How’s that situation with Brooke?

458
00:32:46,851 --> 00:32:48,024
None of your business.

459
00:32:49,374 --> 00:32:50,179
No?

460
00:32:52,237 --> 00:32:53,691
Isn’t that why you really came here?

461
00:32:54,275 --> 00:32:55,743
You know, before this happened to me,

462
00:32:56,606 --> 00:33:01,616
I never quite understood how you could be so selfish.

463
00:33:02,783 --> 00:33:05,021
Everyday of my life I wondered.

464
00:33:06,153 --> 00:33:07,412
Until now.

465
00:33:11,391 --> 00:33:12,880
Now you see the other side.

466
00:33:13,802 --> 00:33:14,939
Yeah, I guess I do.

467
00:33:17,371 --> 00:33:19,236
Don’t be so quick to judge me, Lucas.

468
00:33:20,274 --> 00:33:22,551
It’s easy to have all the answers from a distance.

469
00:33:22,762 --> 00:33:24,948
But everybody makes decisions they regret.

470
00:33:25,211 --> 00:33:27,688
Me. Your mother. Keith.

471
00:33:28,361 --> 00:33:31,267
But we learn to live with it. It’s part of life.

472
00:33:32,014 --> 00:33:33,191
Not my life.

473
00:33:34,630 --> 00:33:35,711
Not yet.

474
00:33:36,193 --> 00:33:38,875
Yeah. Yeah, I felt that once.

475
00:33:40,832 --> 00:33:42,376
Then I grew up.

476
00:33:50,613 --> 00:33:55,157
I was hoping you’d come by soon. We obviously need to talk.

477
00:33:56,561 --> 00:33:58,397
I’m going to make a change, Karen.

478
00:34:01,580 --> 00:34:02,878
What do you mean?

479
00:34:03,303 --> 00:34:10,492
Well, I woke up this morning and everything just felt far away.

480
00:34:11,438 --> 00:34:16,942
And then I went outside and for the first time, Tree Hill didn’t feel like home.

481
00:34:18,059 --> 00:34:23,035
And I just thought, why am I still here? You know?

482
00:34:24,202 --> 00:34:27,270
I never planned on spending my whole life here, and...

483
00:34:30,426 --> 00:34:32,533
I just needed someone to remind me.

484
00:34:33,286 --> 00:34:34,453
And you did that.

485
00:34:35,616 --> 00:34:36,869
And it’s okay.

486
00:34:37,716 --> 00:34:38,648
Are you leaving?

487
00:34:40,991 --> 00:34:42,947
There’s not time like the present, right?

488
00:34:44,283 --> 00:34:46,296
Keith, this isn’t because of me.

489
00:34:46,481 --> 00:34:50,249
No, it’s because of me.

490
00:34:50,899 --> 00:34:57,519
You did me a favor, Karen. By going to Italy, and by saying no to me.

491
00:34:57,606 --> 00:35:01,006
You woke me up. And I appreciate that.

492
00:35:03,223 --> 00:35:04,489
Where are you going to go?

493
00:35:05,030 --> 00:35:06,039
I don’t know.

494
00:35:08,624 --> 00:35:10,422
But I got to say.

495
00:35:13,247 --> 00:35:15,655
It feels really good to have options.

496
00:35:50,923 --> 00:35:53,636
What part of stay away from me do you not understand?

497
00:35:53,697 --> 00:35:55,382
Just give me 60 seconds, okay?

498
00:35:55,488 --> 00:35:57,824
I’m sorry but argument cutoff was 9 o’clock.

499
00:35:58,120 --> 00:36:03,533
Well, I don’t want to argue. You don’t even have to say anything. Just listen.

500
00:36:11,391 --> 00:36:13,573
My dad didn’t want me, okay?

501
00:36:14,290 --> 00:36:19,496
Not just that he didn’t want to claim me, he didn’t want me to be born,

502
00:36:21,074 --> 00:36:27,037
I always thought that when I started a family I’d be, older,

503
00:36:27,965 --> 00:36:30,260
and settled, and I’d be...

504
00:36:30,397 --> 00:36:31,248
In love?

505
00:36:32,404 --> 00:36:33,106
Yeah.

506
00:36:36,408 --> 00:36:39,296
- But so did my mom. 
- Lucas...

507
00:36:39,353 --> 00:36:43,576
No, this whole thing scares the hell out of me, okay?

508
00:36:45,348 --> 00:36:49,414
But whatever you decide to do, I’ll be there.

509
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:55,030
And if you’re not ready, then you’re not ready, but if you want to have this baby,

510
00:36:57,299 --> 00:36:58,655
then so do I.

511
00:37:01,002 --> 00:37:07,585
And whatever it takes for me to be a good father, I‘ll be there.

512
00:37:08,092 --> 00:37:11,092
Always. I promise you.

513
00:37:11,751 --> 00:37:14,204
I won‘t let you down.

514
00:37:19,930 --> 00:37:20,677
Hey.

515
00:37:24,701 --> 00:37:25,833
I lied.

516
00:37:29,415 --> 00:37:30,477
What?

517
00:37:31,163 --> 00:37:32,652
I’m not pregnant.

518
00:37:34,220 --> 00:37:36,703
- But I saw the test. 
- I know.

519
00:37:37,774 --> 00:37:42,668
Then when the doctor called he said I wasn’t pregnant, he said that can happen.

520
00:37:43,390 --> 00:37:47,111
Okay, no, no, no. I was standing right there when he called.

521
00:37:47,188 --> 00:37:49,952
And you had just called me a slut.

522
00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:52,043
So you lied to me to punish me?!

523
00:37:53,901 --> 00:37:54,955
How could you do that?

524
00:37:55,006 --> 00:37:59,082
How could you cheat on me with my best friend?!

525
00:38:02,003 --> 00:38:06,522
Brooke. I never meant to hurt you.

526
00:38:07,494 --> 00:38:09,830
That doesn’t really matter, Lucas.

527
00:38:10,357 --> 00:38:12,957
Cause in the end it all hurts just the same.

528
00:39:51,353 --> 00:39:52,906
Brooke’s not pregnant.

529
00:39:55,821 --> 00:39:57,122
It was just a scare.

530
00:40:01,863 --> 00:40:03,085
Are you okay?

531
00:40:06,164 --> 00:40:07,295
Not really.

532
00:40:18,205 --> 00:40:19,998
Mom, thanks.

533
00:40:21,042 --> 00:40:22,072
For what?

534
00:40:22,956 --> 00:40:24,349
Everything.

535
00:40:29,352 --> 00:40:34,313
