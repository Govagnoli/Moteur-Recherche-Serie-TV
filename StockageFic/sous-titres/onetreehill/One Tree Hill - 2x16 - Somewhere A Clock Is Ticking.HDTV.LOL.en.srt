1
00:00:00,347 --> 00:00:01,949
Previously on One Tree Hill.

2
00:00:02,042 --> 00:00:03,306
I wanna move in with Dan.

3
00:00:03,578 --> 00:00:05,237
Over my dead body!

4
00:00:05,348 --> 00:00:06,843
What does Dan have over you?

5
00:00:06,901 --> 00:00:08,816
How did you convince her that you didn’t have HCM?

6
00:00:08,862 --> 00:00:11,621
I used Keith’s negative results letter.

7
00:00:11,693 --> 00:00:13,034
She left to be with Chris.

8
00:00:13,112 --> 00:00:14,612
She kissed him, before she left.

9
00:00:14,669 --> 00:00:16,957
My investigator found something interesting about Dan.

10
00:00:17,029 --> 00:00:19,393
Let’s just… go slow.

11
00:00:19,481 --> 00:00:20,158
Okay?

12
00:00:21,612 --> 00:00:22,384
Okay.

13
00:00:22,866 --> 00:00:24,467
You know there’s a girl you had feelings for.

14
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:25,795
- Nathan... 
- Look me in the eye.

15
00:00:26,046 --> 00:00:27,089
Tell me I’m wrong.

16
00:00:28,965 --> 00:00:30,156
You need to talk to her, Luke.

17
00:00:31,411 --> 00:00:33,259
I’ve decided to tell Keith the truth.

18
00:00:33,331 --> 00:00:34,616
Maybe you won’t have to.

19
00:00:34,796 --> 00:00:36,506
I think I’ll just let this one go.

20
00:00:38,476 --> 00:00:40,064
Keith doesn’t ever have to know.

21
00:01:25,228 --> 00:01:27,075
Kahlil Gibran once wrote:

22
00:01:28,341 --> 00:01:30,643
You’re reason and your passion are the rudder…

23
00:01:30,742 --> 00:01:32,856
and the sails of your seafaring soul.

24
00:01:34,419 --> 00:01:35,717
If either be broken,

25
00:01:36,348 --> 00:01:40,363
you can but toss and drift, or else be held at a standstill in mid-seas.

26
00:01:42,708 --> 00:01:46,097
For reason, ruling alone, is a force confining;

27
00:01:47,322 --> 00:01:49,538
and passion, unattended,

28
00:01:50,357 --> 00:01:52,953
is a flame that burn to it’s own destruction.

29
00:01:53,187 --> 00:01:54,061
Hey!

30
00:01:55,387 --> 00:01:56,461
Hey!

31
00:01:57,499 --> 00:02:01,113
You’re a… little early… and underdressed.

32
00:02:01,729 --> 00:02:05,251
Yeah well, you know, I’m just… making sure everything’s okay.

33
00:02:06,039 --> 00:02:07,452
Anything I can help you with?

34
00:02:07,571 --> 00:02:08,584
No, no.

35
00:02:09,245 --> 00:02:10,459
You’ve done enough.

36
00:02:10,853 --> 00:02:12,347
Everything is perfect.

37
00:02:13,647 --> 00:02:15,061
I’m getting married today.

38
00:02:21,737 --> 00:02:23,841
Didn’t know rock stars were such early risers.

39
00:02:23,899 --> 00:02:25,451
We just finished rehearsing all night.

40
00:02:26,187 --> 00:02:26,848
Yeah.

41
00:02:27,191 --> 00:02:29,798
Don’t let me stop you from falling into bed with Chris.

42
00:02:29,905 --> 00:02:31,700
It’s not like that and you know it.

43
00:02:33,181 --> 00:02:34,896
I don’t know anything, anymore.

44
00:02:35,408 --> 00:02:38,916
You know, I was just calling to tell you that we’re gonna be on TV.

45
00:02:39,003 --> 00:02:41,583
We’re doing this live interview and I was hoping you’d watch.

46
00:02:42,967 --> 00:02:44,222
That’s why you called?

47
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:48,004
Nathan, none of this means anything if I can’t share it with you.

48
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,843
Keith’s wedding’s today.

49
00:02:53,129 --> 00:02:54,271
He’s getting married?

50
00:02:54,406 --> 00:02:55,157
Yeah.

51
00:02:55,602 --> 00:02:56,646
It won’t last.

52
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:05,787
What can I say to make things better because I really want to. You know?

53
00:03:06,155 --> 00:03:07,107
You can’t.

54
00:03:07,491 --> 00:03:08,377
See...

55
00:03:10,154 --> 00:03:11,951
it’s a part you have to live with.

56
00:03:27,103 --> 00:03:28,221
That was a word!

57
00:03:28,823 --> 00:03:30,455
That was definitely a word.

58
00:03:30,537 --> 00:03:31,944
In what, Swahili?

59
00:03:32,021 --> 00:03:33,112
She said ‘dada’!

60
00:03:33,696 --> 00:03:35,078
My baby’s a genius.

61
00:03:35,947 --> 00:03:39,174
Okay, major news; Brooke Davis is officially twenty-four hours away

62
00:03:39,209 --> 00:03:41,507
from being student council president and rich again!

63
00:03:41,570 --> 00:03:43,802
What, you and Felix getting married, too?

64
00:03:43,874 --> 00:03:47,478
Please! My dad has this final job interview with this giganto company today;

65
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:48,739
they’re taking him to play golf…

66
00:03:48,809 --> 00:03:50,903
and while my dad may not be the brightest tool

67
00:03:51,022 --> 00:03:54,037
in… the wherever they keep tools,

68
00:03:54,108 --> 00:03:56,321
he can play golf like freaking Michael Jordan!

69
00:03:56,602 --> 00:03:57,376
Okay…

70
00:03:57,678 --> 00:04:01,500
And hello, Mrs Jagielski, you two are totally in bed together!

71
00:04:01,607 --> 00:04:02,141
Brooke!

72
00:04:02,214 --> 00:04:05,137
This is great, I am gonna go… and do…

73
00:04:05,301 --> 00:04:09,325
almost rich girl things and you are going to call me later with the details.

74
00:04:13,205 --> 00:04:14,518
She’s saying ‘dada’!

75
00:04:22,244 --> 00:04:23,723
Just leave the caviar.

76
00:04:24,169 --> 00:04:25,653
I’ve acquired a taste for it.

77
00:04:28,245 --> 00:04:30,737
You know, there’s gonna be free food at Keith’s wedding today.

78
00:04:31,477 --> 00:04:33,512
No thank you. I’m not going to that.

79
00:04:33,779 --> 00:04:35,197
You really gonna do that to Keith?

80
00:04:35,481 --> 00:04:36,688
Look who’s talking.

81
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:39,130
I can’t believe you’re actually gonna let them go through with it.

82
00:04:39,226 --> 00:04:41,735
He loves her… and she loves him.

83
00:04:42,012 --> 00:04:43,589
She just made a mistake.

84
00:04:44,332 --> 00:04:46,497
You gonna crucify her for the rest of her life?

85
00:04:50,142 --> 00:04:51,612
Haley called this morning.

86
00:04:52,612 --> 00:04:53,568
That’s great.

87
00:04:53,696 --> 00:04:55,918
Yeah, to tell me she’s gonna be on TV today.

88
00:04:56,179 --> 00:04:57,265
You believe that?

89
00:04:57,427 --> 00:04:59,046
It’s still awesome for her, man.

90
00:04:59,227 --> 00:05:00,336
Yeah, whatever.

91
00:05:02,432 --> 00:05:05,923
Look, Nate, I think you should come to the wedding, man.

92
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:07,376
A lot of people miss you.

93
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:10,300
Nathan! I’m so glad you’re here.

94
00:05:10,408 --> 00:05:12,615
Um… let me make you some eggs?

95
00:05:12,702 --> 00:05:13,648
I think you’re out.

96
00:05:15,925 --> 00:05:17,699
It’s so good to see you.

97
00:05:23,636 --> 00:05:24,622
Sorry.

98
00:06:14,717 --> 00:06:16,072
Great day for a wedding.

99
00:06:17,153 --> 00:06:18,228
What do you want?

100
00:06:18,755 --> 00:06:19,984
Bought you a present.

101
00:06:24,095 --> 00:06:25,524
Something blue, right?

102
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:32,144
I’m not taking it!

103
00:06:32,237 --> 00:06:34,706
Come on, it’s your final payment.

104
00:06:35,607 --> 00:06:37,833
- You said we were done. 
- And we are.

105
00:06:39,047 --> 00:06:41,238
Just wanted to say ‘welcome to the family’.

106
00:06:45,052 --> 00:06:47,014
So easy for you, isn’t it?

107
00:06:48,187 --> 00:06:50,504
Dan Scott; king of the world.

108
00:06:51,243 --> 00:06:53,734
But someday, somebody’s gonna bring you down

109
00:06:54,822 --> 00:06:56,679
and I’m gonna watch.

110
00:06:58,139 --> 00:06:59,808
Don’t hold your breath, sweetheart.

111
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:16,732
Did you talk to your investigator?

112
00:07:16,798 --> 00:07:17,671
I did.

113
00:07:17,965 --> 00:07:19,859
Anything I can use to get Lucas back?

114
00:07:20,008 --> 00:07:20,857
Yeah.

115
00:07:21,737 --> 00:07:23,456
Have you ever heard of Emily Chambers?

116
00:07:23,905 --> 00:07:25,123
No, why?

117
00:07:26,626 --> 00:07:28,813
I think Dan’s having an affair.

118
00:07:39,262 --> 00:07:41,957
Emily Chambers? I’ve never even heard of her.

119
00:07:42,099 --> 00:07:44,292
Well, Dan sure has. He’s paying her rent,

120
00:07:44,905 --> 00:07:47,266
her bills; personal cheque.

121
00:07:47,494 --> 00:07:50,621
Well, why am I even surprised?

122
00:07:52,452 --> 00:07:53,626
Poor Deb!

123
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:57,821
Karen, I know you care for Deb but… Dan’s not fighting fair here.

124
00:07:58,061 --> 00:08:00,564
If we wanna get Lucas back, we have to beat him at his own game.

125
00:08:00,616 --> 00:08:02,986
My guy’s working on a photo; we should find Emily first.

126
00:08:09,898 --> 00:08:11,696
Little liquid courage for the groom?

127
00:08:12,177 --> 00:08:13,370
Hello, Nathan.

128
00:08:14,139 --> 00:08:15,951
It’s not too late to stop him, you know?

129
00:08:16,027 --> 00:08:17,932
Tell him what kind of hell he’s really in for…

130
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:20,010
like someone should have done for me.

131
00:08:20,621 --> 00:08:23,496
You’re getting pretty good at the moody, broody bit, aren’t you?

132
00:08:24,006 --> 00:08:26,501
Plan to give Lucas a run for his money?

133
00:08:26,605 --> 00:08:29,058
Whatever! Let’s have it.

134
00:08:29,124 --> 00:08:30,045
And what’s that?

135
00:08:30,118 --> 00:08:31,423
The inspirational story.

136
00:08:32,206 --> 00:08:34,889
Isn’t this the part where you tell me everything’s gonna be okay?

137
00:08:35,678 --> 00:08:39,047
I’m sorry; the pity store’s closed today.

138
00:08:39,703 --> 00:08:42,205
Besides, I’m not sure you’re worth it anymore.

139
00:08:42,553 --> 00:08:43,229
Great!

140
00:08:43,435 --> 00:08:47,228
Look son, you took a big risk and I admire you for that,

141
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:50,398
but it’s easy to be happy when things are going well.

142
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:54,878
Marriage is about making it through,

143
00:08:55,036 --> 00:08:57,857
staying together even when things turn to crap.

144
00:08:58,299 --> 00:08:59,993
Looks like I got my story anyway.

145
00:09:00,131 --> 00:09:01,917
Will you grow the hell up?!

146
00:09:02,451 --> 00:09:05,114
You might not like Haley very much right now,

147
00:09:05,175 --> 00:09:08,525
but she’s still your wife and where I come from, that still means something,

148
00:09:08,592 --> 00:09:10,264
whether like it or not!

149
00:09:12,377 --> 00:09:14,011
There’s your story.

150
00:09:14,963 --> 00:09:17,415
By the way, his ID’s fake.

151
00:09:37,267 --> 00:09:38,173
Knock knock!!

152
00:09:41,582 --> 00:09:42,766
Jeez!

153
00:09:44,665 --> 00:09:46,688
Crazy girl, what are you doing to my heart?

154
00:09:47,085 --> 00:09:49,452
Good thing you don’t have that genetic defect!

155
00:09:50,524 --> 00:09:51,352
Yeah.

156
00:09:51,843 --> 00:09:52,868
What’re you doing here?

157
00:09:52,970 --> 00:09:56,657
Well, I just came by to let you know that my safe ride’s program;

158
00:09:56,758 --> 00:10:01,044
‘DW not I’, is officially up and running so pass the word at the reception.

159
00:10:01,101 --> 00:10:04,458
You know, drunk and bitter bridesmaids and…

160
00:10:04,895 --> 00:10:05,678
Deb.

161
00:10:06,726 --> 00:10:07,592
Yeah.

162
00:10:08,765 --> 00:10:12,041
It’s a shame I’m… not gonna be there myself.

163
00:10:13,454 --> 00:10:15,001
To let everyone know…

164
00:10:15,344 --> 00:10:17,193
about the program.

165
00:10:19,435 --> 00:10:20,330
What?

166
00:10:20,859 --> 00:10:21,867
I don’t know;

167
00:10:22,893 --> 00:10:26,469
big… romantic ceremony…

168
00:10:27,244 --> 00:10:29,168
followed by a big fancy party.

169
00:10:29,701 --> 00:10:30,403
Wow!

170
00:10:30,577 --> 00:10:32,283
Oh… I know.

171
00:10:32,794 --> 00:10:35,774
And then there’s the flowers and the dresses and the vows!

172
00:10:35,845 --> 00:10:37,269
Not to mention my best man speech.

173
00:10:37,335 --> 00:10:39,890
Come on, you’re killing me. You know I’m a sucker for weddings!

174
00:10:40,402 --> 00:10:45,697
Any chance you could use a date, in a just friends sorta way to pal around with?

175
00:10:46,352 --> 00:10:47,412
What about Felix?

176
00:10:47,518 --> 00:10:50,887
Grounded; his parents found out the ‘Bash for Brooke’…

177
00:10:51,813 --> 00:10:55,132
and besides, we said we were gonna try to be friends.

178
00:10:56,135 --> 00:10:57,123
Yeah, we did.

179
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,170
Please.

180
00:11:00,538 --> 00:11:03,508
Please, Lucas! Please, please, please, I wanna go so bad!

181
00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:05,382
- Okay. 
- Yay!

182
00:11:06,539 --> 00:11:07,385
It’s a date.

183
00:11:08,588 --> 00:11:10,247
Kinda - sorta - not really.

184
00:11:10,339 --> 00:11:11,818
Yeah, whatever, I’m in.

185
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:13,457
Just… pick me up early.

186
00:11:21,204 --> 00:11:22,530
Hello, hottie!

187
00:11:22,631 --> 00:11:24,260
Oh… yeah, well,

188
00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:26,209
this one wasn’t my mom’s, so…

189
00:11:26,286 --> 00:11:28,663
Yeah, well… neither was this one!

190
00:11:29,017 --> 00:11:29,867
Whoa!

191
00:11:30,624 --> 00:11:34,024
I know, I kinda Anne Frank’d a couple things in the attic before the yard sale.

192
00:11:34,162 --> 00:11:35,694
So you’re going to the wedding?

193
00:11:38,157 --> 00:11:40,162
With… Lucas.

194
00:11:40,971 --> 00:11:42,328
Just as friends.

195
00:11:42,851 --> 00:11:43,865
Really?

196
00:11:44,321 --> 00:11:47,136
Come on, love triangles are so last season.

197
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:50,536
So, I mean, Felix is totally cool with it, right?

198
00:11:51,411 --> 00:11:54,269
I actually haven’t, um… told him yet.

199
00:11:54,458 --> 00:11:54,913
Brooke!

200
00:11:54,981 --> 00:11:59,036
I know, it’s just, I’ve never just been friends with a guy before except Mouth and…

201
00:11:59,261 --> 00:12:00,013
that’s different.

202
00:12:00,173 --> 00:12:01,288
Well how’s it going?

203
00:12:01,343 --> 00:12:04,852
Good! Felix is my boyfriend, Lucas and I are just friends.

204
00:12:04,922 --> 00:12:05,733
I promise.

205
00:12:06,453 --> 00:12:08,447
But I love you for looking out for me.

206
00:12:08,953 --> 00:12:09,750
Okay.

207
00:12:11,202 --> 00:12:13,171
On the subject of boys;

208
00:12:13,309 --> 00:12:15,061
how are things going with Jake?

209
00:12:15,657 --> 00:12:17,980
You know, still taking it slow.

210
00:12:18,057 --> 00:12:19,701
Oh, slow’s good,

211
00:12:20,182 --> 00:12:21,093
fast is better!

212
00:12:22,157 --> 00:12:23,079
Shut up!

213
00:12:29,204 --> 00:12:30,493
Lucas, hi.

214
00:12:30,576 --> 00:12:31,286
Hey.

215
00:12:31,415 --> 00:12:32,363
You better get dressed.

216
00:12:33,426 --> 00:12:34,410
Yeah, I know.

217
00:12:35,874 --> 00:12:38,241
I know Nathan was kind of abrupt this morning…

218
00:12:39,217 --> 00:12:41,440
just wanted to make sure you were okay.

219
00:12:42,632 --> 00:12:43,642
I’m fine.

220
00:12:45,276 --> 00:12:46,171
Deb…

221
00:12:48,296 --> 00:12:49,777
after my accident…

222
00:12:50,549 --> 00:12:55,336
the doctors prescribed me some… really powerful painkillers

223
00:12:56,333 --> 00:12:58,381
except for they gave them to my mom…

224
00:12:58,433 --> 00:13:00,675
because they knew how easy it would be for me…

225
00:13:01,296 --> 00:13:04,162
or anyone for that matter to become addicted.

226
00:13:05,667 --> 00:13:07,915
Have you been spying on me?

227
00:13:08,913 --> 00:13:12,867
- I was just...
- You are a guest in my house, Lucas…

228
00:13:13,045 --> 00:13:14,807
and as long as you’re living under my roof,

229
00:13:14,878 --> 00:13:18,298
I would appreciate you not snooping around in my life!

230
00:13:18,796 --> 00:13:20,316
Deb, I’m just trying to help.

231
00:13:20,393 --> 00:13:25,595
Oh, go-yeah, that’s just what I need; an adolescent boy to solve all my problems.

232
00:13:25,682 --> 00:13:26,148
Deb!

233
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:27,659
Get the hell outta here, Lucas.

234
00:13:27,736 --> 00:13:29,512
You are way outta line,

235
00:13:29,615 --> 00:13:31,329
and way out of your league!

236
00:13:44,556 --> 00:13:47,141
So you, uh, still think this looks weird?

237
00:13:48,674 --> 00:13:50,217
And it feels pretty good, too.

238
00:13:50,453 --> 00:13:51,406
I love you.

239
00:13:54,427 --> 00:13:57,017
Oh god, that… that kinda came out, didn’t it?

240
00:14:02,052 --> 00:14:04,952
Not that I… not that I don’t mean it, coz…

241
00:14:05,363 --> 00:14:08,163
I’ve been dying to say that for a-for a while now, it just,

242
00:14:08,224 --> 00:14:09,894
it just never seems like the right time.

243
00:14:10,605 --> 00:14:12,434
You know, what with Lucas being thrown into jail

244
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:15,716
and me getting a private investigator, it’s just…

245
00:14:17,144 --> 00:14:17,989
well...

246
00:14:23,754 --> 00:14:24,793
I love you.

247
00:14:25,745 --> 00:14:28,121
I love your mind, I love your heart,

248
00:14:28,326 --> 00:14:30,272
I love picturing our future together.

249
00:14:30,472 --> 00:14:32,355
I mean, I hate the thought of you…

250
00:14:33,333 --> 00:14:34,859
ever not being in my life.

251
00:14:34,943 --> 00:14:37,558
- Andy...
- And, I don’t want you to say anything.

252
00:14:39,211 --> 00:14:40,603
You… know, I just…

253
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:42,436
I just had to get that out.

254
00:14:43,112 --> 00:14:44,363
I love you too.

255
00:14:47,803 --> 00:14:49,656
I was hoping you’d say that!

256
00:14:55,415 --> 00:14:58,116
- Peyton! 
- I’m so sorry, I’m not ready yet.

257
00:14:58,182 --> 00:15:00,346
Just give me two seconds. I’m being a total girl.

258
00:15:00,418 --> 00:15:01,770
That’s okay, we got time.

259
00:15:12,057 --> 00:15:13,070
Wow!

260
00:15:15,367 --> 00:15:17,007
‘Total girl’ is right!

261
00:15:21,651 --> 00:15:22,808
It’s a, uh…

262
00:15:23,934 --> 00:15:26,095
good thing that we’re taking it slow, right?

263
00:15:26,361 --> 00:15:27,247
Yeah.

264
00:15:27,863 --> 00:15:28,727
Slow.

265
00:15:30,893 --> 00:15:31,897
Yeah.

266
00:16:52,514 --> 00:16:54,176
- Hi. 
- Hi.

267
00:16:57,145 --> 00:16:58,701
You know you look amazing, right?

268
00:17:00,216 --> 00:17:01,016
Thanks.

269
00:17:17,457 --> 00:17:18,756
How’re you feeling?

270
00:17:19,376 --> 00:17:20,273
Happy.

271
00:17:20,907 --> 00:17:21,983
Yeah, me too.

272
00:17:27,354 --> 00:17:28,664
Man, we’re gonna be late.

273
00:17:29,244 --> 00:17:31,946
Weddings always start a little bit late anyway, right?

274
00:17:32,806 --> 00:17:34,163
At least half an hour.

275
00:17:35,433 --> 00:17:36,600
Works for me.

276
00:17:48,268 --> 00:17:50,154
Oh, it’s beautiful!

277
00:17:50,901 --> 00:17:52,728
Thank you for bringing me, Lucas.

278
00:17:53,150 --> 00:17:54,198
You’re welcome.

279
00:17:56,741 --> 00:18:00,316
So… how are things with Felix?

280
00:18:01,667 --> 00:18:03,787
Good! Great!

281
00:18:04,352 --> 00:18:05,149
Yeah?

282
00:18:05,589 --> 00:18:08,917
Yeah. He helped me with my campaign and…

283
00:18:09,149 --> 00:18:10,388
threw me a party.

284
00:18:11,632 --> 00:18:12,906
So you guys are good.

285
00:18:14,805 --> 00:18:15,829
I don’t know.

286
00:18:16,311 --> 00:18:18,993
He’s been… so sweet.

287
00:18:19,527 --> 00:18:20,806
Really, but…

288
00:18:21,293 --> 00:18:23,982
lately, I just kinda find myself feeling…

289
00:18:25,302 --> 00:18:26,736
independent!

290
00:18:27,012 --> 00:18:28,150
Amazingly.

291
00:18:29,019 --> 00:18:31,692
I don’t even know if I want a boyfriend right now!

292
00:18:32,751 --> 00:18:34,159
I guess we’re both…

293
00:18:34,753 --> 00:18:36,078
finding a new way…

294
00:18:36,381 --> 00:18:37,723
for ourselves, huh?

295
00:18:38,716 --> 00:18:39,883
I guess so.

296
00:18:42,699 --> 00:18:43,811
Okay, listen up,

297
00:18:44,512 --> 00:18:46,872
you go out, they’ll ask you a couple of questions.

298
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:49,494
Now keep it positive. You’re thrilled to be on TV.

299
00:18:49,689 --> 00:18:50,887
It’s all about living the dream.

300
00:18:50,957 --> 00:18:52,187
- Absolutely.
- Absolutely.

301
00:18:52,243 --> 00:18:54,302
Oh, take off the wedding ring.

302
00:18:54,378 --> 00:18:54,932
What!?

303
00:18:55,014 --> 00:18:56,089
It’s a love song, Haley.

304
00:18:56,157 --> 00:18:58,439
Look, you and Chris, I mean, look, you sound like a couple,

305
00:18:58,490 --> 00:19:01,033
you look like a couple, let them think you’re a couple.

306
00:19:01,112 --> 00:19:02,771
But we’re not a couple!

307
00:19:03,889 --> 00:19:04,917
Details.

308
00:19:05,018 --> 00:19:06,282
Yeah, come on, Haley.

309
00:19:07,389 --> 00:19:08,325
Alright, look…

310
00:19:09,559 --> 00:19:12,391
the girls should wanna be you and the guys should wanna be with you,

311
00:19:12,458 --> 00:19:14,644
alright, the wedding ring kinda gets in the way of it all.

312
00:19:14,709 --> 00:19:15,749
For some people.

313
00:19:18,141 --> 00:19:20,828
Okay, well, you guys can figure it out but…

314
00:19:20,951 --> 00:19:23,282
trust me, I’d lose the ring.

315
00:19:23,332 --> 00:19:24,791
- I’m leaving right now! 
- Listen, I’m not...

316
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,602
I can not believe you’re asking me to do this!

317
00:19:28,846 --> 00:19:31,283
Haley, this is our shot! Nothing else matters.

318
00:19:31,335 --> 00:19:32,129
Nathan matters!

319
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:33,578
Then what are you doing here?

320
00:19:33,930 --> 00:19:37,014
Listen, you made a decision. Don’t blink now!

321
00:20:09,351 --> 00:20:12,535
Alright, I’m Nick Zano and this is Totally Live Week.

322
00:20:12,597 --> 00:20:15,213
That was Chariot, the new one from Gavin DeGraw

323
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:17,677
who’s on tour right now with The Wreakers,

324
00:20:17,733 --> 00:20:21,020
otherwise known as Michelle Branch and Jessica Harp.

325
00:20:21,098 --> 00:20:24,406
Also on that tour are two newcomers who’s single,

326
00:20:24,466 --> 00:20:26,858
When the Stars Go Blue drops next Tuesday,

327
00:20:26,929 --> 00:20:29,090
we’re here live with Chris Keller and Haley James.

328
00:20:29,182 --> 00:20:30,058
Haley James-Scott.

329
00:20:30,129 --> 00:20:31,707
Uh-oh, three name roll.

330
00:20:31,763 --> 00:20:33,714
Girls with three names are always trouble.

331
00:20:33,806 --> 00:20:35,097
Ah, this one’s no different.

332
00:20:35,208 --> 00:20:37,824
Oh, okay. Now, you guys have great chemistry;

333
00:20:37,896 --> 00:20:40,769
obviously a great sound, now tell the truth,

334
00:20:40,855 --> 00:20:42,182
you a couple in real life?

335
00:20:42,688 --> 00:20:45,270
- Um, actually...
- You know, the music never lies.

336
00:20:46,810 --> 00:20:49,995
Say no more! You heard it here first.

337
00:20:50,077 --> 00:20:54,465
Alright, let’s take another look at those tour dates and we’ll be back, right after this.

338
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:00,002
Same colour as that shirt. You know where you’re sitting, right?

339
00:21:00,073 --> 00:21:01,201
See you inside.

340
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:04,480
- Can I get one of you two? 
- Absolutely.

341
00:21:08,918 --> 00:21:10,808
Well, well, well, my son cleans up good.

342
00:21:10,885 --> 00:21:11,673
Thank you.

343
00:21:12,217 --> 00:21:13,173
How are you, Deb?

344
00:21:13,559 --> 00:21:14,406
Great!

345
00:21:14,612 --> 00:21:15,865
The place is beautiful.

346
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:17,838
I think we’re gonna head inside.

347
00:21:19,001 --> 00:21:20,500
Save a slow dance for me Miss. Davis.

348
00:21:20,576 --> 00:21:21,396
Okay!

349
00:21:22,293 --> 00:21:23,699
You old perv!

350
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:27,201
I’m sorry.

351
00:21:27,704 --> 00:21:31,781
It’s okay. I get worse than that from drunk high school boys every Saturday night.

352
00:21:31,892 --> 00:21:35,338
Yeah, but it’s worse when it’s not drunken high school boys but your dad!

353
00:21:36,556 --> 00:21:38,606
I’ve never heard you call him that before.

354
00:21:39,558 --> 00:21:42,372
I’m trying it out. See how it sounds.

355
00:21:42,532 --> 00:21:44,503
And? What do you think?

356
00:21:47,305 --> 00:21:49,300
Okay, it’s freezing in here.

357
00:21:49,378 --> 00:21:51,973
Yeah, that’s probably by design; Keith’s kind of a sweater,

358
00:21:52,045 --> 00:21:53,397
especially when he’s nervous.

359
00:21:53,502 --> 00:21:55,577
Okay, things I never needed to know.

360
00:21:56,248 --> 00:21:57,016
Sorry.

361
00:21:57,829 --> 00:21:59,346
Look, here you go.

362
00:21:59,586 --> 00:22:00,447
Thank you.

363
00:22:00,570 --> 00:22:04,216
So look, I have to go see Keith, you know, start being the best man.

364
00:22:04,825 --> 00:22:05,588
You gonna be okay?

365
00:22:05,690 --> 00:22:10,401
Well, can your ego handle it if I tell you I just needed someone to get me in the door?

366
00:22:10,691 --> 00:22:11,737
Not really.

367
00:22:12,121 --> 00:22:14,482
Then, boy, I am gonna miss you.

368
00:22:15,833 --> 00:22:16,637
Yeah.

369
00:22:28,425 --> 00:22:30,098
Old habits die hard, huh?

370
00:22:30,532 --> 00:22:33,456
It’s-it’s just water, smart ass.

371
00:22:33,527 --> 00:22:34,239
Yeah.

372
00:22:34,415 --> 00:22:36,364
It’s just so damn hot in there.

373
00:22:37,046 --> 00:22:38,295
You’re gonna be fine.

374
00:22:38,406 --> 00:22:39,375
Yeah, yeah, I know.

375
00:22:39,473 --> 00:22:41,603
But, uh, I’m still glad you’re here though.

376
00:22:41,956 --> 00:22:43,722
Even if you are still living with the Devil.

377
00:22:46,052 --> 00:22:48,889
Hey, listen, I don’t-I don’t wanna get mushy but, um,

378
00:22:49,937 --> 00:22:51,336
I just wanna say thanks.

379
00:22:51,566 --> 00:22:52,359
For what?

380
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:55,765
Just… for being you, and for being my best man.

381
00:22:56,776 --> 00:22:58,078
You really are it, you know?

382
00:22:58,446 --> 00:23:00,766
And I’m real proud of the man you’re turning out to be.

383
00:23:00,988 --> 00:23:03,571
Nah, who do you think I learned it from?

384
00:23:07,571 --> 00:23:10,417
Um, just… give me a second, huh?

385
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,054
Yeah, I’ll be inside.

386
00:23:21,349 --> 00:23:22,593
You look amazing.

387
00:23:23,084 --> 00:23:23,919
Thanks.

388
00:23:24,417 --> 00:23:26,650
So do you… as always.

389
00:23:28,723 --> 00:23:30,646
It’s good to see you so happy.

390
00:23:31,144 --> 00:23:32,353
Jules is great.

391
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:34,160
Yeah, she is.

392
00:23:35,194 --> 00:23:38,368
It’s like I finally found my place in the world and it was...

393
00:23:38,604 --> 00:23:40,042
it was right here all along.

394
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:42,807
I’m glad.

395
00:23:45,741 --> 00:23:46,591
Come here.

396
00:23:53,647 --> 00:23:57,921
Also, I really appreciate you and Deb standing up for Jules, you know?

397
00:23:58,147 --> 00:23:59,626
She really doesn’t have anybody else.

398
00:23:59,708 --> 00:24:00,708
Of course.

399
00:24:01,502 --> 00:24:02,453
Thank you…

400
00:24:03,218 --> 00:24:06,825
and, um, now I’ve got some vows to go make.

401
00:24:06,896 --> 00:24:07,930
Yes you do!

402
00:24:09,113 --> 00:24:10,799
- I’ll see you up there. 
- Okay.

403
00:24:20,321 --> 00:24:21,407
Is everything okay?

404
00:24:21,664 --> 00:24:24,878
Yeah. I just gotta go pick something up real quick.

405
00:24:25,258 --> 00:24:26,107
Right now?

406
00:24:26,692 --> 00:24:28,432
Yeah, I’ll be right back, trust me.

407
00:24:28,723 --> 00:24:30,506
I wouldn’t miss seeing you walk down that aisle.

408
00:24:39,704 --> 00:24:41,181
Don’t look at me.

409
00:24:44,566 --> 00:24:45,629
Have you been crying?

410
00:24:46,470 --> 00:24:48,047
Just tearing up a little.

411
00:24:49,102 --> 00:24:50,479
I read your speech.

412
00:24:50,807 --> 00:24:51,625
Brooke!

413
00:24:52,347 --> 00:24:54,899
Don’t leave your journal where I can find that, either.

414
00:24:56,813 --> 00:24:57,974
It was beautiful.

415
00:24:59,645 --> 00:25:02,762
‘Remember tonight for it is the beginning of always’.

416
00:25:04,027 --> 00:25:05,506
That’s Dante.

417
00:25:06,039 --> 00:25:07,835
We read him last semester.

418
00:25:08,869 --> 00:25:11,415
And I need to pay more attention in English.

419
00:25:13,898 --> 00:25:15,035
The rest is me.

420
00:25:17,461 --> 00:25:20,738
The part about taking chances and believing in the possibility,

421
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:23,745
even when life has given you every reason not to believe…

422
00:25:27,308 --> 00:25:29,340
That’s what’s so great about weddings;

423
00:25:30,242 --> 00:25:31,977
you know, two people come together…

424
00:25:34,184 --> 00:25:36,222
and even if it’s just for one night,

425
00:25:37,005 --> 00:25:38,910
they make us believe again.

426
00:25:40,606 --> 00:25:42,877
Stop! I don’t have anymore tissues!

427
00:25:45,351 --> 00:25:46,083
Here.

428
00:25:48,505 --> 00:25:52,258
I just hope at my wedding, someone says something that nice about me.

429
00:25:52,790 --> 00:25:54,417
I think you can count on that.

430
00:25:57,052 --> 00:25:58,499
Oh my god!

431
00:25:58,883 --> 00:26:00,650
You guys totally did it!

432
00:26:02,795 --> 00:26:06,272
Um… Uh, Brooke, we’re – we’re in a church!

433
00:26:06,476 --> 00:26:09,542
So?! If I can tell, so can He!

434
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:14,882
Black tie;

435
00:26:15,615 --> 00:26:19,431
I haven’t worn one of these things since Dick Nixon was in office.

436
00:26:19,819 --> 00:26:21,329
Look what happened to him.

437
00:26:21,666 --> 00:26:24,673
Well, I, um, I appreciate the effort.

438
00:26:24,789 --> 00:26:26,388
I feel like a penguin!

439
00:26:27,340 --> 00:26:28,558
Where’re your folks?

440
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:32,195
Oh, um… they’re on safari, believe it or not.

441
00:26:32,278 --> 00:26:35,415
Dad’s off, uh, killing big animals or something.

442
00:26:36,225 --> 00:26:39,781
What has happened to the world for god’s sake; their son’s getting married!

443
00:26:39,837 --> 00:26:43,638
Yeah well, you know, they offered to cancel but I knew Royal would just pout about it the whole time

444
00:26:43,688 --> 00:26:46,966
so I - I just told them to come on down next month and meet Jules.

445
00:26:47,047 --> 00:26:49,622
So, for right now, you’re all I got.

446
00:26:49,719 --> 00:26:51,589
Lord help you if that’s true.

447
00:26:53,038 --> 00:26:56,719
Maybe you’d like a little boost from Mr J.D.

448
00:26:56,990 --> 00:27:01,272
Um… actually I think I’m gonna do this one sober.

449
00:27:02,141 --> 00:27:04,652
True love! That’s a good one.

450
00:27:05,341 --> 00:27:09,719
Don’t… do it, Keith! Just get out while you can! It’s all a lie!

451
00:27:13,006 --> 00:27:14,849
There’s no such thing as forever!

452
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,236
What the hell are you doing?!

453
00:27:19,724 --> 00:27:21,460
This is a church for god’s sake!

454
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:23,901
Oh, shut your hole you freaking hypocrite!

455
00:27:24,065 --> 00:27:25,064
I know what you did.

456
00:27:25,135 --> 00:27:28,090
Nathan, it’s okay. Let us help you.

457
00:27:28,319 --> 00:27:29,200
Do what?

458
00:27:29,753 --> 00:27:31,120
Be happy again.

459
00:27:31,439 --> 00:27:34,402
Happy? You don’t even know how to be happy, mom.

460
00:27:35,283 --> 00:27:37,019
Haley and I never stood a chance with you.

461
00:27:37,096 --> 00:27:38,386
Is that what you think?

462
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:42,333
You, you hire Chris too? Huh?

463
00:27:42,472 --> 00:27:43,951
Don’t make me knock you out, son.

464
00:27:44,090 --> 00:27:46,527
Screw you, you sick son of a bitch!

465
00:27:49,527 --> 00:27:52,349
Hey, come on! Come on. Hey! Hey!

466
00:27:52,742 --> 00:27:54,912
Don’t do this to Keith. Not here.

467
00:27:55,543 --> 00:27:56,419
You alright?

468
00:27:57,834 --> 00:27:58,636
Come on.

469
00:27:59,650 --> 00:28:00,443
Nate...

470
00:28:04,181 --> 00:28:05,291
What’re you doing, man?

471
00:28:05,627 --> 00:28:07,718
She said she was with Chris…

472
00:28:08,209 --> 00:28:09,721
on national TV.

473
00:28:11,756 --> 00:28:12,956
I don’t believe it.

474
00:28:13,417 --> 00:28:14,456
Neither did I.

475
00:28:15,618 --> 00:28:17,007
It’s really over, huh?

476
00:28:17,354 --> 00:28:18,835
Only if you say it is.

477
00:28:20,872 --> 00:28:22,291
I’m hurting, Luke.

478
00:28:24,958 --> 00:28:26,360
It’s gonna be okay.

479
00:28:26,479 --> 00:28:28,455
No, I mean I think I’m gonna puke!

480
00:28:28,537 --> 00:28:29,196
Hey...

481
00:28:35,152 --> 00:28:37,010
‘DW not I’ at your service!

482
00:28:37,983 --> 00:28:38,915
Okay, watch your head.

483
00:28:41,721 --> 00:28:43,958
Okay, this is perfect; and I don’t mean what happened today,

484
00:28:44,016 --> 00:28:47,947
just for ‘DW not I’, it’s so great that Nathan got smashed!

485
00:28:50,225 --> 00:28:51,952
Just make sure he gets inside, okay?

486
00:28:52,028 --> 00:28:52,703
Thanks.

487
00:28:57,773 --> 00:28:59,964
- Oh, thank god you’re back! 
- Yeah, we have a problem.

488
00:29:00,045 --> 00:29:01,791
I know, Nathan’s a mess and we have to start...

489
00:29:01,837 --> 00:29:03,281
I’ve found Emily Chambers.

490
00:29:03,379 --> 00:29:04,147
What!?

491
00:29:05,145 --> 00:29:06,640
Emily Chambers is Jules.

492
00:29:26,244 --> 00:29:27,223
You all set?

493
00:29:28,318 --> 00:29:30,382
Yeah, just gotta get my veil.

494
00:29:31,949 --> 00:29:34,350
Sure, let me help you with that...

495
00:29:34,979 --> 00:29:35,897
Emily.

496
00:29:39,659 --> 00:29:40,959
Did Lucas tell you?

497
00:29:44,094 --> 00:29:46,546
He knows that you’re having an affair with Dan?!

498
00:29:47,924 --> 00:29:49,869
I’m not having an affair with Dan.

499
00:29:50,478 --> 00:29:51,405
Oh, really?

500
00:29:53,069 --> 00:29:58,660
Then tell me, why would Dan put you up in an apartment and pay all your bills…

501
00:29:58,824 --> 00:30:02,265
and seemingly control every detail of your life unless…?

502
00:30:05,290 --> 00:30:06,478
Oh my god!

503
00:30:07,327 --> 00:30:10,467
It’s Keith. He’s paying you to get back at Keith!

504
00:30:10,667 --> 00:30:11,737
He was.

505
00:30:12,387 --> 00:30:13,969
You’re a whore!

506
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:16,513
No. I was in trouble.

507
00:30:16,785 --> 00:30:19,576
The wedding was never part of the plan. It changed.

508
00:30:19,704 --> 00:30:21,337
I told Dan I wanted out.

509
00:30:21,864 --> 00:30:24,148
I fell in love with Keith for real.

510
00:30:24,521 --> 00:30:26,456
How could you do that to Keith?

511
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:29,170
After everything that he has been through!

512
00:30:29,386 --> 00:30:31,751
You mean after everything you’ve put him through?

513
00:30:35,407 --> 00:30:36,783
How dare you!

514
00:30:38,371 --> 00:30:39,702
How dare you.

515
00:30:41,188 --> 00:30:42,662
You didn’t want him.

516
00:30:43,174 --> 00:30:46,328
Now that he’s actually found someone who loves him back…

517
00:30:47,475 --> 00:30:49,993
you wanna take that away from him, too?

518
00:30:50,439 --> 00:30:52,292
I want him to know…

519
00:30:53,245 --> 00:30:55,247
who you really are.

520
00:30:57,217 --> 00:30:58,729
Moment of truth!

521
00:31:03,378 --> 00:31:04,862
He’s happy, Karen.

522
00:31:06,429 --> 00:31:08,240
Can’t you just let him be happy?

523
00:31:11,590 --> 00:31:13,720
Was it awesome? Just give me a hint.

524
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:15,455
Brooke!

525
00:31:16,290 --> 00:31:17,924
I know we’re in a church.

526
00:31:18,482 --> 00:31:21,461
So blink once if it was good and twice if it was better than that.

527
00:31:26,192 --> 00:31:28,112
Ooo, my god, I love weddings!

528
00:31:48,009 --> 00:31:49,314
- You okay? 
- I don’t know.

529
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:50,410
What’d she say?

530
00:31:50,861 --> 00:31:51,823
It’s not Dan.

531
00:31:52,756 --> 00:31:53,979
She loves Keith.

532
00:31:54,143 --> 00:31:55,146
And you believe her?

533
00:32:02,488 --> 00:32:03,937
I think I have to.

534
00:32:04,694 --> 00:32:06,554
That’s our cue, gotta go.

535
00:32:42,158 --> 00:32:43,740
Your mom looks beautiful.

536
00:34:05,781 --> 00:34:06,731
I’m sorry.

537
00:34:07,406 --> 00:34:08,222
She left.

538
00:34:20,653 --> 00:34:22,048
- Give me your keys! 
- Keith...

539
00:34:22,127 --> 00:34:23,964
Just give me your keys!

540
00:34:27,955 --> 00:34:28,736
Keith!

541
00:34:31,030 --> 00:34:31,865
Keith!

542
00:34:44,021 --> 00:34:44,855
Keith!

543
00:34:55,945 --> 00:34:57,127
You said you were done!

544
00:34:57,717 --> 00:34:59,161
That you’d leave them alone.

545
00:34:59,242 --> 00:35:00,421
I didn’t do anything.

546
00:35:00,548 --> 00:35:03,523
I promise you Lucas; I wouldn’t jeopardise my relationship with you again.

547
00:35:03,758 --> 00:35:06,170
You – sick – bastard!

548
00:35:06,735 --> 00:35:08,698
I threatened to tell Keith.

549
00:35:11,459 --> 00:35:14,449
I found out about your arrangement and I went to Jules.

550
00:35:16,216 --> 00:35:18,129
And I threatened to tell the truth.

551
00:35:31,314 --> 00:35:32,501
Nice work, Cupid.

552
00:35:33,112 --> 00:35:34,171
This one’s on you.

553
00:36:01,001 --> 00:36:02,429
Remember tonight,

554
00:36:03,114 --> 00:36:05,700
for it is the beginning of always.

555
00:36:11,414 --> 00:36:12,393
A promise.

556
00:36:13,032 --> 00:36:16,483
Like a reward for persisting through life so long alone.

557
00:36:47,004 --> 00:36:48,120
Jules?!

558
00:36:50,063 --> 00:36:50,937
Jules?!

559
00:36:59,633 --> 00:37:04,560
The belief in each other and the possibility of love.

560
00:37:13,195 --> 00:37:14,375
A decision...

561
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:18,697
to ignore or simply rise above the pain of the past.

562
00:37:28,402 --> 00:37:29,459
The covenant,

563
00:37:30,318 --> 00:37:34,825
which at once binds two souls and yet severs prior ties.

564
00:37:42,617 --> 00:37:43,974
What have we done?

565
00:37:46,643 --> 00:37:47,513
Karen...

566
00:37:48,603 --> 00:37:49,990
I’m sorry...

567
00:37:51,735 --> 00:37:53,421
I need to see Keith.

568
00:38:12,306 --> 00:38:13,741
The celebration...

569
00:38:14,458 --> 00:38:18,248
of the chance taken, and the challenge that lies ahead.

570
00:38:38,041 --> 00:38:39,495
One down…

571
00:38:44,463 --> 00:38:45,824
…one to go.

572
00:39:05,916 --> 00:39:08,828
- For two will always be stronger than one. 
- Hey, baby.

573
00:39:08,885 --> 00:39:11,568
Like a team, braced against the tempest’s of the world.

574
00:39:11,694 --> 00:39:12,689
Can you say ‘dada’?

575
00:39:13,197 --> 00:39:14,973
- Can you say dada? 
- Hey, Jenny, who’s that?

576
00:39:15,044 --> 00:39:16,744
- Can you say ‘dada’? 
- Who’s that?!

577
00:39:16,941 --> 00:39:18,117
Mama.

578
00:39:21,638 --> 00:39:22,644
Nikki!

579
00:39:39,633 --> 00:39:43,578
And love… will always be the guiding force in our lives.

580
00:39:55,831 --> 00:39:56,936
What’re you doing here?

581
00:39:58,806 --> 00:40:01,509
Making sure you find the kind of happiness…

582
00:40:01,719 --> 00:40:03,394
I can barely remember.

583
00:40:09,441 --> 00:40:10,617
Go get Haley.

584
00:40:11,569 --> 00:40:12,804
She’s your wife.

585
00:40:29,562 --> 00:40:31,624
For tonight is mere formality…

586
00:40:32,951 --> 00:40:36,505
only an announcement to the world for feelings long held.

587
00:40:37,390 --> 00:40:42,556
Promises made long ago in the sacred space of our hearts.

588
00:40:45,853 --> 00:40:47,411
What, more bad news?

589
00:40:49,171 --> 00:40:50,760
My dad got that job.

590
00:40:52,786 --> 00:40:54,333
Brooke, that’s great!

591
00:40:54,809 --> 00:40:56,621
It’s in California!

592
00:40:59,832 --> 00:41:01,689
We’re moving next week.

593
00:41:07,019 --> 00:41:08,069
I don’t wanna go.

594
00:41:16,333 --> 00:41:17,516
What’re we gonna do?

595
00:41:36,752 --> 00:41:40,318
