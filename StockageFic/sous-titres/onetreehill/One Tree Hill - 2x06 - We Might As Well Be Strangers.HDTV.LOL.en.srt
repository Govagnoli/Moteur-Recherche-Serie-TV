1
00:00:00,574 --> 00:00:02,128
Previously on One Tree Hill.

2
00:00:02,175 --> 00:00:04,898
You passed the band’s test, now you gotta pass mine.

3
00:00:04,957 --> 00:00:07,090
Car salesmen are always such jerks.

4
00:00:07,167 --> 00:00:09,154
- I’m actually a mechanic. 
- I like mechanics.

5
00:00:09,245 --> 00:00:10,664
It’s my first college class.

6
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:12,927
And you’re taking it with Hargrove? This gut’s tough.

7
00:00:13,014 --> 00:00:15,579
My name’s Andy Hargrove, welcome to my class.

8
00:00:15,651 --> 00:00:19,542
It’s called ‘Dare Night’; one night, two teams, multiple dares.

9
00:00:19,957 --> 00:00:21,150
Oh! My gosh!

10
00:00:21,434 --> 00:00:23,321
- What do we win? 
- A night to remember.

11
00:00:23,378 --> 00:00:24,304
I’m in it to win it.

12
00:00:25,191 --> 00:00:27,735
Three dollars and… eighty cents.

13
00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:19,133
Katherine Anne Porter once said;

14
00:01:19,935 --> 00:01:22,435
There seems to be a kind of order in the universe…

15
00:01:24,663 --> 00:01:27,617
in the movement of the stars and the turning of the Earth

16
00:01:27,745 --> 00:01:29,076
and the changing of the seasons.

17
00:01:30,193 --> 00:01:32,562
But human life is almost pure chaos.

18
00:01:35,845 --> 00:01:37,397
Everyone takes his stance,

19
00:01:38,276 --> 00:01:40,150
asserts his own right and feelings,

20
00:01:40,802 --> 00:01:42,701
mistaking the motives of others,

21
00:01:44,037 --> 00:01:45,072
and his own.

22
00:02:04,901 --> 00:02:07,889
Felix, let’s get going! I don’t wanna be late!

23
00:02:10,279 --> 00:02:11,815
Your skirt’s a little short isn’t it?

24
00:02:13,057 --> 00:02:14,668
I’m just looking out for you.

25
00:02:14,934 --> 00:02:15,846
Can we just go?

26
00:02:16,082 --> 00:02:18,513
Sure, as soon as you discover pants.

27
00:02:18,846 --> 00:02:21,602
You know why? Because first impressions are important Anna.

28
00:02:21,738 --> 00:02:23,679
And yours says all night.

29
00:02:23,925 --> 00:02:25,451
You know what, I’ll ride the bus.

30
00:02:26,225 --> 00:02:27,263
Anna okay!

31
00:02:27,672 --> 00:02:28,953
- Come on!
- No!

32
00:02:29,015 --> 00:02:30,611
- I’m just playing. 
- You’re being mean!

33
00:02:30,694 --> 00:02:32,189
Let me guess.

34
00:02:34,021 --> 00:02:37,663
One of your ‘Friends with Benefits’ hoes didn’t wanna pay her deductible?

35
00:02:37,971 --> 00:02:39,681
Gross, that’s my sister.

36
00:02:40,654 --> 00:02:45,046
Wait! You mean after they had you, your parents rolled the dice and kept breeding?

37
00:02:45,517 --> 00:02:46,382
It’s risky.

38
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:47,304
Funny!

39
00:02:47,729 --> 00:02:50,454
You know, I was thinking about this whole ‘Friends with Benefits’.

40
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:52,220
Felix with Brooke.

41
00:02:53,362 --> 00:02:54,641
FWB.

42
00:02:54,903 --> 00:02:59,772
Hmm… IYFD… In Your Dreams.

43
00:03:06,966 --> 00:03:11,988
I saw you in 87; against Williamsburg. You put up, what, thirty-five points?

44
00:03:12,056 --> 00:03:14,206
- Thirty-seven. 
- Man you were unstoppable.

45
00:03:14,985 --> 00:03:16,225
You play college ball?

46
00:03:17,269 --> 00:03:19,285
How long until we have the results.

47
00:03:19,448 --> 00:03:23,510
The doctor will call in a day or two but… his numbers look… good

48
00:03:23,571 --> 00:03:25,180
for a guy who just had a heart attack.

49
00:03:26,019 --> 00:03:28,553
I tell you what I’m gonna put this on warm-down for you, okay?

50
00:03:29,726 --> 00:03:33,429
There, better? How bout that?

51
00:03:33,535 --> 00:03:36,797
- Good, it’s good. 
- Alright, hey you take your time man.

52
00:03:41,896 --> 00:03:46,075
How am I supposed to pass a stress test with some orderly reminding me my best days are behind me?

53
00:03:46,434 --> 00:03:49,388
Come on, he says you’re doing fine.

54
00:03:50,805 --> 00:03:51,611
Thanks.

55
00:03:52,477 --> 00:03:56,264
You must be happy; in forty-eight hours… you won’t have to wait on me anymore.

56
00:03:59,753 --> 00:04:02,485
Well I’m not going to put my mind on waiting for a phone call.

57
00:04:03,541 --> 00:04:05,957
Word in the paper, there’s gonna be a meteor shower this weekend.

58
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,620
Thought maybe I’d got out and watch it from the beach house.

59
00:04:09,296 --> 00:04:10,310
Good for you, Dan.

60
00:04:12,471 --> 00:04:13,971
Maybe we could watch it together.

61
00:04:17,530 --> 00:04:19,711
You’ve been with me every step of this recovery Deb.

62
00:04:21,452 --> 00:04:24,888
We could go out there and… I could make you dinner. Just to say thanks.

63
00:04:25,892 --> 00:04:26,705
That’s all.

64
00:04:31,268 --> 00:04:32,461
Sorry, we’re closed.

65
00:04:32,747 --> 00:04:36,997
Yeah, I know... I was just wondering if I could post this flyer on your board.

66
00:04:37,208 --> 00:04:39,722
I’m… auditioning bands for a local talent night.

67
00:04:39,905 --> 00:04:41,114
‘All-Ages’ night.

68
00:04:41,749 --> 00:04:44,084
Tell you what, you can post it if you take your shirt off.

69
00:04:45,411 --> 00:04:49,614
- Excuse me?! 
- Emo’s crap. Gives punk a bad name.

70
00:04:49,999 --> 00:04:51,625
- You think? 
- I do.

71
00:04:52,011 --> 00:04:56,107
Huh, well I guess those who can’t do, sell records!

72
00:04:56,209 --> 00:04:57,971
You insult all your customers this way?

73
00:04:58,043 --> 00:05:01,141
Well since we’re not really open, you’re not really a customer.

74
00:05:02,343 --> 00:05:03,848
Whatever, I’m going to school.

75
00:05:03,909 --> 00:05:05,980
Don’t forget your Get-Up-Kids lunchbox.

76
00:05:07,365 --> 00:05:10,556
You know, its real punk to be up at seven a.m. doing inventory.

77
00:05:11,632 --> 00:05:13,050
I never went to sleep.

78
00:05:19,604 --> 00:05:20,616
Hello?

79
00:05:21,007 --> 00:05:22,272
Jules, its Keith.

80
00:05:23,903 --> 00:05:26,188
Keith, you know, the guy who took you on that drive.

81
00:05:27,135 --> 00:05:28,118
Gotcha.

82
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:35,088
Well the reason I’m calling is the… follow-up customer satisfaction survey.

83
00:05:35,163 --> 00:05:40,357
On a scale of one to ten; how happy were you with the service at ‘Dan Scott Motors’?

84
00:05:41,227 --> 00:05:45,769
Well the guy who helped me was nice and… kinda cute.

85
00:05:45,876 --> 00:05:48,364
But he waited a whole week to call me and when he did,

86
00:05:48,431 --> 00:05:51,129
he came up with some lame excuse about a survey.

87
00:05:51,424 --> 00:05:52,483
I’d give him a seven.

88
00:05:52,824 --> 00:05:55,334
Well you think we could, uh, bump that up to an eight or a nine?

89
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,402
Maybe over dinner tomorrow night.

90
00:05:57,888 --> 00:06:00,936
Maybe if he comes to my place and cooks for me.

91
00:06:01,397 --> 00:06:02,158
Okay.

92
00:06:11,883 --> 00:06:12,652
Hey Coach.

93
00:06:12,911 --> 00:06:13,853
Scott!

94
00:06:15,006 --> 00:06:16,081
How you feeling?

95
00:06:16,203 --> 00:06:19,937
Oh, like a school girl in springtime. What can I do for ya?

96
00:06:20,019 --> 00:06:24,248
Well… I just wanted to talk to you about your surgery.

97
00:06:25,005 --> 00:06:28,478
- Keith had told me that...
- Who gives a damn what Keith says?

98
00:06:28,913 --> 00:06:30,321
It’s not his life.

99
00:06:31,519 --> 00:06:35,339
Okay… I just don’t know why you’re not going through with the surgery.

100
00:06:38,221 --> 00:06:40,668
Lucas, do you know how my wife died?

101
00:06:41,698 --> 00:06:46,788
In surgery. Like twenty thousand other people a year and I don’t plan to be one of them!

102
00:06:46,874 --> 00:06:49,102
- Look, Coach. 
- No, you look!

103
00:06:49,578 --> 00:06:52,282
We are not in season, there’s no practice.

104
00:06:52,636 --> 00:06:57,530
Now I want you to turn around and get out of my office and mind your own damn business!

105
00:07:08,442 --> 00:07:10,408
This club night, is gonna rule!

106
00:07:10,495 --> 00:07:12,688
Not according to the jerk at the record store.

107
00:07:13,324 --> 00:07:14,720
What are these auditions?

108
00:07:15,083 --> 00:07:19,957
Oh… I think Peyton’s having like an ‘All-Ages’ night at the… at Karen’s Club.

109
00:07:20,035 --> 00:07:21,423
She’s kinda looking for bands or something.

110
00:07:21,525 --> 00:07:24,325
- When do you go on? 
- Not! Stop it.

111
00:07:24,397 --> 00:07:25,058
Hales!

112
00:07:25,765 --> 00:07:29,196
It’s one thing to play at home for you, it’s another to get up in front of a crowd to do it

113
00:07:29,281 --> 00:07:30,322
and there’s no way.

114
00:07:31,013 --> 00:07:34,269
Nathan, letter came for you through my office.

115
00:07:34,935 --> 00:07:35,682
What is it?

116
00:07:35,989 --> 00:07:39,817
How the hell should I know?! Do I look like the damn postmaster general?!

117
00:07:42,036 --> 00:07:45,702
A meteor shower occurs when the Earth passes through the cloud of dust

118
00:07:45,769 --> 00:07:48,669
left behind by a comet, in its orbit of the sun.

119
00:07:53,737 --> 00:07:54,458
Here you go.

120
00:07:56,267 --> 00:07:57,895
Lucas, you’re wanted in the office.

121
00:07:58,837 --> 00:07:59,711
Take your books.

122
00:08:05,171 --> 00:08:05,893
Hey.

123
00:08:06,133 --> 00:08:06,911
Anna?

124
00:08:07,832 --> 00:08:09,022
What are you doing here?

125
00:08:09,394 --> 00:08:12,040
I’m sorry I didn’t call you after ‘Dare Night’.

126
00:08:13,122 --> 00:08:14,813
Give me a chance to explain.

127
00:08:15,231 --> 00:08:16,306
I mean, you owe me that.

128
00:08:17,597 --> 00:08:18,559
I owe you?

129
00:08:19,144 --> 00:08:20,844
I got you out of Science didn’t I?

130
00:08:22,665 --> 00:08:24,469
Where did you get this Hall Pass anyway?

131
00:08:24,872 --> 00:08:26,839
I swiped it, when I met the principle.

132
00:08:27,162 --> 00:08:31,918
Look, I’m sorry I blew you off. My brother’s kind of… overprotective.

133
00:08:31,982 --> 00:08:34,064
Because we haven’t gone to the same school in a few years and...

134
00:08:34,146 --> 00:08:35,774
Wait, Felix is your brother?

135
00:08:35,897 --> 00:08:36,543
Um…

136
00:08:38,677 --> 00:08:39,492
yeah.

137
00:08:40,655 --> 00:08:43,039
I figured you’d connect the dots sooner or later.

138
00:08:44,628 --> 00:08:50,516
Anyway... I told Felix that I hadn’t met any guys and…

139
00:08:50,767 --> 00:08:54,140
I don’t know, I just didn’t wanna have to deal with him so I didn’t call you.

140
00:08:54,212 --> 00:08:57,946
I’m sorry. I figured when Felix saw those pictures of us in the photo booth,

141
00:08:58,042 --> 00:08:59,508
he’d let you know who I was.

142
00:08:59,911 --> 00:09:02,989
You know, I still can’t figure if he’s screwing with me or what.

143
00:09:04,142 --> 00:09:05,827
I never gave him the pictures.

144
00:09:07,751 --> 00:09:08,621
Why?

145
00:09:11,326 --> 00:09:13,276
Because it wasn’t just about ‘Dare Night’ for me.

146
00:09:15,385 --> 00:09:16,159
Me neither.

147
00:09:25,079 --> 00:09:27,945
That’s a decaf latte with one shot of Irish cream.

148
00:09:28,648 --> 00:09:29,328
Thanks.

149
00:09:29,533 --> 00:09:32,875
Ah, you’ve been pouring me free coffee in the café a week, I figured I’d return the favour.

150
00:09:33,266 --> 00:09:36,805
Well unlike you I need an ‘A’, consider that coffee my apple.

151
00:09:37,372 --> 00:09:40,254
Um, so look. I was wondering if you were available tomorrow night,

152
00:09:40,322 --> 00:09:42,380
to… to watch the meteor shower.

153
00:09:44,321 --> 00:09:45,340
Just the two of us?

154
00:09:46,997 --> 00:09:50,107
Well I could… schedule a… class… felid trip if it makes you feel safer.

155
00:09:50,163 --> 00:09:51,571
Oh no no no. That’s not it.

156
00:09:52,829 --> 00:09:56,113
It’s just that… going back to school was a big step for me.

157
00:09:57,838 --> 00:10:03,532
And you’re afraid that you’ll screw it up. Like… I don’t know, dating your professor. Yes.

158
00:10:07,383 --> 00:10:07,997
Karen…

159
00:10:11,371 --> 00:10:14,633
I wouldn’t ask you to hang out with me if I thought it was gonna compromise your studies,

160
00:10:15,129 --> 00:10:15,922
or my job.

161
00:10:18,708 --> 00:10:22,487
You know, unless… unless you, you know, simply don’t wanna hang out with me

162
00:10:22,543 --> 00:10:25,688
- because that’s okay too. 
- Oh no, no no, I do. That’s... not it.

163
00:10:26,947 --> 00:10:27,787
Good.

164
00:10:30,249 --> 00:10:32,615
So... so what do you say? Tomorrow night?

165
00:10:34,224 --> 00:10:34,981
Okay.

166
00:10:35,802 --> 00:10:36,852
Good.

167
00:10:38,005 --> 00:10:39,288
Well I’ll leave you too it.

168
00:10:40,884 --> 00:10:45,548
Oh and, hey, I know it’s kinda short notice so… bring Lucas along if you can’t find a sitter.

169
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,645
Love to meet the little guy.

170
00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:50,562
Oh I don’t think that’s gonna be a problem.

171
00:10:52,021 --> 00:10:52,727
Okay.

172
00:10:57,844 --> 00:11:02,954
Stars. To the human eye they appear very close together but as you know, in reality...

173
00:11:03,036 --> 00:11:06,240
‘High Flyers’ is like this Allstar basketball boot camp.

174
00:11:06,374 --> 00:11:09,446
And this guy Milt West, he scouts the best players in the country

175
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:11,760
and invites them down to Florida so they can work on their skills.

176
00:11:11,827 --> 00:11:13,469
And invited you. Wow.

177
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:18,595
Nathan, I’m really happy for you. You deserve this you’ve… you’ve worked really hard.

178
00:11:25,431 --> 00:11:27,485
Okay, could it get any worse?

179
00:11:27,996 --> 00:11:31,852
My love life is non-existent, my parents are having a yard sale to sell everything that we own

180
00:11:31,904 --> 00:11:33,977
and I had to beg them to keep my car.

181
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:34,940
Okay.

182
00:11:35,247 --> 00:11:38,682
You might not be rich but you are still Brooke Davis;

183
00:11:38,759 --> 00:11:41,673
the most popular, least studious girl in school.

184
00:11:41,821 --> 00:11:46,036
Maybe so, but being poor and horny is no way to go through life.

185
00:11:46,117 --> 00:11:47,622
How am I supposed to have fun?

186
00:11:48,217 --> 00:11:52,728
Boys won’t care about the poor part, just as long as you tell them about the horny part.

187
00:11:52,897 --> 00:11:55,134
To top it all off, if my parents go broke,

188
00:11:55,211 --> 00:11:58,622
I might actually have to study to get into college.

189
00:11:58,693 --> 00:12:00,940
My God the horror!

190
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,186
I know!

191
00:12:02,528 --> 00:12:04,427
How the mighty have fallen.

192
00:12:19,272 --> 00:12:21,407
I think I need a little recess.

193
00:12:21,996 --> 00:12:25,815
What do you get when two, flaming, stellar bodies collide?

194
00:12:27,372 --> 00:12:30,624
Okay, here’s the thing; we are not dating, we are not going out, we are nothing.

195
00:12:30,685 --> 00:12:32,779
I am not your wife, your shrink, your mommy.

196
00:12:32,836 --> 00:12:36,322
There’s no romance, no crappy poetry, no PDA and no spooning.

197
00:12:36,419 --> 00:12:39,547
This is purely physical. If we have sex, it’s gonna be safe sex;

198
00:12:39,616 --> 00:12:42,728
we’re ‘Friends with Benefits’ and in fact, we don’t even need to talk.

199
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:44,208
- I can live with that. 
- Great!

200
00:12:51,053 --> 00:12:55,544
So, there’s this new girl, named Anna, in my algebra class.

201
00:12:56,721 --> 00:12:58,375
She be the ‘Dare Night’ mystery girl?

202
00:12:58,565 --> 00:13:02,267
Yeah. Also happens to be Felix’s sister.

203
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:05,631
Nice! D’you know bout that?

204
00:13:05,759 --> 00:13:07,234
Just found out this morning.

205
00:13:07,531 --> 00:13:11,140
Well don’t hold it against her man, she can’t help it if her brother’s an ass.

206
00:13:13,403 --> 00:13:14,581
So ‘High Flyers’?

207
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:19,113
I mean, what I wouldn’t give, three months in Florida, playing basketball at that camp.

208
00:13:20,403 --> 00:13:21,595
Is it three months?

209
00:13:22,087 --> 00:13:23,310
Yeah, I think so. Why?

210
00:13:24,618 --> 00:13:25,826
That’s all summer.

211
00:13:25,958 --> 00:13:30,039
I mean, we can’t live for three months off Haley’s café paycheque.

212
00:13:30,285 --> 00:13:32,877
And even if we could, I mean I don’t wanna be apart from her that long.

213
00:13:33,388 --> 00:13:34,852
You guys will figure it out.

214
00:13:36,982 --> 00:13:40,562
Nathan, this is a once in a lifetime opportunity…

215
00:13:41,576 --> 00:13:42,620
you know that.

216
00:13:56,387 --> 00:13:57,853
What are you doing here?

217
00:13:58,466 --> 00:13:59,995
I just wanted to say hello.

218
00:14:01,565 --> 00:14:02,953
You’ve said it.

219
00:14:07,044 --> 00:14:08,651
Nathan got into ‘High Flyers’.

220
00:14:10,899 --> 00:14:13,040
And he couldn’t have done it without you so I…

221
00:14:15,082 --> 00:14:16,630
I just thought you’d care to know.

222
00:14:18,457 --> 00:14:19,307
Son!

223
00:14:20,623 --> 00:14:23,725
The mistake you’re making is - you think I care;

224
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:28,661
about you, about the team, about anything.

225
00:14:30,801 --> 00:14:34,126
I lost the only thing I cared about a long time ago.

226
00:14:39,451 --> 00:14:41,974
You know, I have this picture in my room of the team…

227
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:45,205
from your five-hundredth win.

228
00:14:47,213 --> 00:14:50,377
And the man in that photo still looks like a guy to me that still cares about something.

229
00:14:52,036 --> 00:14:53,346
We need you, Coach.

230
00:14:53,991 --> 00:14:56,804
Not just to win games, we need you in our lives!

231
00:15:05,359 --> 00:15:06,572
Have the surgery.

232
00:15:18,634 --> 00:15:20,945
Oh, I figured this summer out. I thought I would call Karen -

233
00:15:21,007 --> 00:15:22,861
see if I could stay with her and Lucas for a little while,

234
00:15:22,942 --> 00:15:25,721
till you get back or like, rent a room from her. We’ll save a ton.

235
00:15:25,779 --> 00:15:27,033
- Think she’ll go for that? 
- Oh please!

236
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:29,244
Before you came along, I practically lived there anyway.

237
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:33,035
- Then I’ll pick up some extra shifts at the café...
- Haley, you work enough already.

238
00:15:33,106 --> 00:15:35,528
Hey, you’re gonna go to this camp if I have to sell a kidney.

239
00:15:35,983 --> 00:15:37,627
It’s only three months, I just…

240
00:15:38,139 --> 00:15:40,254
wish I could go to Florida with you.

241
00:15:42,844 --> 00:15:44,089
Isn’t this Brooke’s house?

242
00:15:44,749 --> 00:15:46,553
Hey! Be careful with that.

243
00:15:46,766 --> 00:15:49,163
It’s Venetian and I’m not talking Vegas!

244
00:15:50,173 --> 00:15:51,356
You finding anything?

245
00:15:51,509 --> 00:15:53,484
Uh, just this picture frame.

246
00:15:53,735 --> 00:15:55,891
- Just take it. 
- No, I insist.

247
00:15:58,815 --> 00:15:59,977
Thanks Mouth.

248
00:16:02,343 --> 00:16:03,351
- Hi!
- Hey.

249
00:16:03,423 --> 00:16:05,866
I didn’t recognise the address. We won’t buy anything.

250
00:16:06,377 --> 00:16:09,465
It’s okay. We sold my pride around eight thirty.

251
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:13,922
I’d rather see you wearing my clothes than any of these fifty year old wannabes.

252
00:16:14,257 --> 00:16:16,301
So I’ll give you the ‘Good Friend Discount’.

253
00:16:16,373 --> 00:16:17,733
Okay. Thanks.

254
00:16:18,241 --> 00:16:19,752
- I’m gonna go look around. 
- Okay.

255
00:16:21,457 --> 00:16:23,899
- How do you do it? 
- Do what?

256
00:16:24,115 --> 00:16:27,027
You gave up your family’s money to be poor, Nate.

257
00:16:27,146 --> 00:16:30,780
You know what they say Brooke; money can’t buy love.

258
00:16:31,796 --> 00:16:37,048
Maybe so. My mom sure had a good run; renting it for a while. Excuse me.

259
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:41,349
What are you doing here? Pool’s closed today.

260
00:16:42,178 --> 00:16:43,992
You didn’t get my text message?

261
00:16:44,826 --> 00:16:46,485
Thought you might wanna… hang out.

262
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:51,323
Okay; amendment to the rules – hook-ups will be initiated by me

263
00:16:51,386 --> 00:16:54,509
where and when I say and I say not here, not now!

264
00:16:54,719 --> 00:16:56,347
I’d like to buy this dollhouse.

265
00:16:57,728 --> 00:16:59,935
Oh no. It’s not for sale.

266
00:17:00,013 --> 00:17:02,456
But there’s a price tag on it; one fifty.

267
00:17:02,958 --> 00:17:06,122
Well it’s a misprint. The one should be a four.

268
00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:10,136
Four… fifty!

269
00:17:29,690 --> 00:17:30,659
You okay?

270
00:17:33,633 --> 00:17:35,124
My room - five minutes.

271
00:17:41,562 --> 00:17:45,513
You gotta hang your wrist. You know? Freeze after the release.

272
00:17:45,707 --> 00:17:48,221
Like Jordan did when he beat Utah in the finals.

273
00:17:49,614 --> 00:17:51,277
What about following the ball?

274
00:17:51,508 --> 00:17:53,638
Following the ball is following your miss.

275
00:17:53,703 --> 00:17:54,477
Right.

276
00:17:55,328 --> 00:17:56,132
You play?

277
00:17:56,623 --> 00:17:57,427
A little bit.

278
00:17:58,648 --> 00:18:01,055
We beat the crap out of our lady of peace every year.

279
00:18:03,202 --> 00:18:06,019
So… what d’ya say?

280
00:18:07,073 --> 00:18:08,462
Quick game of hog?

281
00:18:11,345 --> 00:18:13,519
How bout this; for every shot I hit…

282
00:18:14,239 --> 00:18:16,203
you tell me something about yourself.

283
00:18:17,304 --> 00:18:18,129
Okay.

284
00:18:19,081 --> 00:18:20,771
And what do I get when I win?

285
00:18:21,569 --> 00:18:23,127
What d’ya have in mind?

286
00:18:24,962 --> 00:18:25,977
I win…

287
00:18:26,607 --> 00:18:28,640
we watch the meteor shower together.

288
00:18:29,471 --> 00:18:30,571
And if I win?

289
00:18:31,251 --> 00:18:36,292
If you win, we watch the meteor shower together.

290
00:18:43,726 --> 00:18:44,811
Smells good in there.

291
00:18:46,209 --> 00:18:47,888
Oh I… brought some wine.

292
00:18:48,426 --> 00:18:50,156
Nah. I’m more of a beer girl.

293
00:18:53,976 --> 00:18:55,947
So this place is... it’s nice.

294
00:18:56,357 --> 00:19:00,145
Thanks! It’s early… American… garage sale.

295
00:19:01,814 --> 00:19:03,980
I have to say, you really know your way around a kitchen.

296
00:19:04,043 --> 00:19:06,020
Which is impressive since it’s not even yours.

297
00:19:06,091 --> 00:19:06,792
Thanks.

298
00:19:07,116 --> 00:19:09,261
You know, I would have invited you over to my place

299
00:19:09,311 --> 00:19:12,212
but everything’s still in boxes from when I moved back so...

300
00:19:12,646 --> 00:19:13,711
Charleston right?

301
00:19:14,586 --> 00:19:19,389
I guess I keep thinking if I don’t unpack then, you know, maybe the move still happens.

302
00:19:23,244 --> 00:19:24,657
Is that you oven timer?

303
00:19:26,193 --> 00:19:28,805
Actually… it’s the smoke alarm.

304
00:19:29,506 --> 00:19:30,407
Oh boy!

305
00:19:49,073 --> 00:19:50,324
You know what I’d love?

306
00:19:51,032 --> 00:19:52,056
I-HOP.

307
00:19:53,131 --> 00:19:54,073
Perfect.

308
00:19:56,766 --> 00:19:57,842
Okay…

309
00:19:59,061 --> 00:20:00,883
my confession is;

310
00:20:03,091 --> 00:20:05,731
I didn’t tell Felix I was coming here tonight.

311
00:20:06,768 --> 00:20:09,209
But I’m going to. I swear.

312
00:20:13,213 --> 00:20:13,997
Granny.

313
00:20:14,754 --> 00:20:16,009
From the free-throw line.

314
00:20:23,715 --> 00:20:24,658
Nice shot!

315
00:20:24,899 --> 00:20:27,217
Thank you. So whatta you got?

316
00:20:29,235 --> 00:20:31,600
I confess that I’m sometimes selfish.

317
00:20:32,614 --> 00:20:35,630
I don’t always give back as much as I get.

318
00:20:40,003 --> 00:20:45,430
Well, well. I believe that’s… H… O… G.

319
00:20:45,733 --> 00:20:47,690
And… did I win?

320
00:20:50,838 --> 00:20:53,243
Looks like you owe me one meteor shower.

321
00:20:58,002 --> 00:21:00,545
Why don’t we just call it ‘Club Suck’?

322
00:21:02,179 --> 00:21:04,381
Hey thank you, that was, that was…

323
00:21:04,547 --> 00:21:07,038
- Really… something. 
- Great. That was great.

324
00:21:07,130 --> 00:21:09,239
Um… we’ll… let you know.

325
00:21:12,414 --> 00:21:13,816
That was the last of them.

326
00:21:14,944 --> 00:21:19,413
Well, we can go with the balding wedding band, or the bad ballad guy.

327
00:21:19,501 --> 00:21:22,352
Great, so club no-name has no acts.

328
00:21:24,052 --> 00:21:27,299
Huh, Nathan just sent me an MP3.

329
00:21:27,398 --> 00:21:30,202
Nathan? Oh that’s ah, that a virus! You don’t wanna.

330
00:21:30,381 --> 00:21:31,232
Stop!

331
00:21:37,851 --> 00:21:41,473
Why did we even bother having auditions? Haley this is awesome!

332
00:21:41,647 --> 00:21:42,372
It’s...

333
00:21:45,457 --> 00:21:47,708
Oh, it’s the rude record store guy.

334
00:21:48,077 --> 00:21:51,369
Um, can you just put the CD’s by the side of the stage? Thank you.

335
00:21:52,763 --> 00:21:54,609
How many other songs have you written?

336
00:21:55,583 --> 00:21:56,814
I dunno. A few!

337
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:58,062
Alright, well you’re gonna open.

338
00:21:58,185 --> 00:22:01,824
Uh, no! I’m not! I have… major stage fright.

339
00:22:01,923 --> 00:22:06,045
You learned an entire cheer routine in three hours and, you rock the house.

340
00:22:06,131 --> 00:22:08,374
Okay, with a group, I can not do it by myself.

341
00:22:08,492 --> 00:22:10,673
No! You’re gonna have to find someone else. I’m sorry.

342
00:23:15,113 --> 00:23:16,957
I think you just found your man.

343
00:23:19,622 --> 00:23:22,404
Hey, this is Peyton and you’re great!

344
00:23:22,476 --> 00:23:25,911
- Yeah I know. When do I play? 
- Um… well seven thirty...

345
00:23:25,968 --> 00:23:29,239
You’re okay but we had a lot of really good people show up today.

346
00:23:29,373 --> 00:23:33,366
- So… we’ll call you. 
- Whatever. Not Emo enough for you?

347
00:23:33,941 --> 00:23:35,721
Hey, I heard your song, it’s not bad.

348
00:23:35,926 --> 00:23:39,547
The key of ‘A’s kinda crap but… you pulled it off.

349
00:23:40,688 --> 00:23:43,761
Okay, are you out of your mind? He’s clearly the best.

350
00:23:44,023 --> 00:23:47,822
Yeah, he’s good but… he’s a jerk!

351
00:23:47,918 --> 00:23:51,375
And… he’s like… arrogant and self-righteous.

352
00:23:51,462 --> 00:23:54,140
Peyton, you’re not dating him. Just put the club first.

353
00:23:54,222 --> 00:23:58,354
I am. I don’t need him Haley, I’ve got you!

354
00:23:59,854 --> 00:24:01,446
Think about it, okay?

355
00:24:02,101 --> 00:24:03,371
You can do this.

356
00:24:05,660 --> 00:24:09,096
So I thought you said we were gonna watch the meteor shower from your yard.

357
00:24:11,022 --> 00:24:11,713
Um…

358
00:24:13,377 --> 00:24:15,128
actually, this is my yard.

359
00:24:15,373 --> 00:24:16,157
You’re kidding.

360
00:24:18,483 --> 00:24:19,650
You’re not kidding?

361
00:24:21,089 --> 00:24:22,317
No. I…

362
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:26,859
I bought it a year ago. Its real-estate right? It’s good business.

363
00:24:28,150 --> 00:24:30,125
My house is about half a mile up that way.

364
00:24:32,809 --> 00:24:35,129
Well it’s… its very beautiful.

365
00:24:35,342 --> 00:24:39,203
Yeah. Yeah it’s a little of the south island and North Carolina, you know?

366
00:24:40,653 --> 00:24:43,198
So how does a New Zealander end up here anyway?

367
00:24:45,368 --> 00:24:47,421
Wow… let’s see...

368
00:24:48,409 --> 00:24:50,177
my dad died when I was fourteen

369
00:24:50,945 --> 00:24:54,806
and my mom figured we’d better move to the states before I turned into a rugby bum like him.

370
00:24:56,977 --> 00:25:00,151
And… did you know there’s a One Tree Hill in Auckland?

371
00:25:00,392 --> 00:25:03,085
- Yeah, I’ve heard that. 
- Yeah. It’s a volcano.

372
00:25:03,701 --> 00:25:06,746
Or it was twenty thousand years ago and now it’s a park.

373
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:10,935
We used to picnic in it sometimes so when mom saw this tree Hill on the map -

374
00:25:11,543 --> 00:25:12,726
figured it was meant to be.

375
00:25:14,349 --> 00:25:17,012
So she raised you all by herself in a foreign country.

376
00:25:18,225 --> 00:25:19,726
She must be quite a woman.

377
00:25:20,571 --> 00:25:21,698
Yep, she is.

378
00:25:23,311 --> 00:25:27,389
I dunno, thinking back, I would have loved to have seen her do something

379
00:25:27,435 --> 00:25:29,322
like go back to school after dad died. You know?

380
00:25:30,637 --> 00:25:32,762
So she could get to live her own life rather than…

381
00:25:33,550 --> 00:25:36,327
always having to sacrifice so I could live mine.

382
00:25:39,716 --> 00:25:40,908
Table for two?

383
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:22,500
Can’t believe they sold my dresser.

384
00:26:23,499 --> 00:26:24,683
Got anything to drink?

385
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:28,092
Water, if the plumbing’s still hooked up.

386
00:26:30,895 --> 00:26:33,525
You sure you’re okay with this whole… ’Friends with Benefits’ thing?

387
00:26:33,659 --> 00:26:35,036
Why wouldn’t I be?

388
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:37,929
You know, it’s just most girls I know –

389
00:26:38,328 --> 00:26:40,991
unable to hook up without the emotional entanglements.

390
00:26:41,641 --> 00:26:45,891
Well, try having your boyfriend hook up with your best friend

391
00:26:45,956 --> 00:26:48,471
and see if that’s not tangled enough for you.

392
00:26:49,148 --> 00:26:50,447
Lucas and Peyton?

393
00:26:52,737 --> 00:26:56,603
God, why am I even telling you this? I thought I made it clear; we don’t talk!

394
00:26:57,284 --> 00:27:00,285
If I wanted to have a conversation, I’d find someone with half a brain.

395
00:27:00,514 --> 00:27:03,597
Did I mention its ‘Friends with Benefits’?

396
00:27:03,796 --> 00:27:05,650
Hmm… don’t kid yourself.

397
00:27:06,295 --> 00:27:09,168
Your only advantage is that you live thirty seconds away.

398
00:27:11,564 --> 00:27:15,154
So, no friends.

399
00:27:15,364 --> 00:27:18,068
Not for me! Just ‘benefits’.

400
00:27:21,324 --> 00:27:22,875
Close the door on your way out.

401
00:27:56,921 --> 00:28:00,602
So now… Nathan and I are cool.

402
00:28:01,334 --> 00:28:03,982
And that makes Haley your… sister-in-law?

403
00:28:05,804 --> 00:28:07,335
Weird, but yeah.

404
00:28:08,165 --> 00:28:11,191
I thought I had a complicated relationship with my brother.

405
00:28:11,308 --> 00:28:13,551
Yeah, what is Felix’s deal anyway?

406
00:28:14,770 --> 00:28:17,029
He’s not as bad as he seems.

407
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:21,047
So why didn’t you tell Felix about me?

408
00:28:21,523 --> 00:28:23,271
It just… never came up.

409
00:28:26,363 --> 00:28:27,499
Look Anna,

410
00:28:29,512 --> 00:28:31,154
I like you.

411
00:28:34,181 --> 00:28:38,092
And… I think… if we hang out…

412
00:28:38,446 --> 00:28:40,064
I’m just gonna like you more.

413
00:28:43,055 --> 00:28:44,677
But I don’t wanna sneak around.

414
00:28:46,259 --> 00:28:47,960
You gotta talk to Felix.

415
00:28:51,846 --> 00:28:55,158
You know, I never thought I’d have my brother, Dan, to thank for a night like this.

416
00:28:55,687 --> 00:28:58,963
Must be pretty different going from fixing cars to selling them.

417
00:28:59,147 --> 00:29:02,037
Nah. Truth is, I always had it in my plan.

418
00:29:02,988 --> 00:29:04,047
What d’ya mean?

419
00:29:04,617 --> 00:29:09,721
Well, I had the idea to open a dealership… long before Danny ever came round to it.

420
00:29:10,550 --> 00:29:12,414
I just didn’t have the capital.

421
00:29:13,122 --> 00:29:18,918
Then when I saved enough, Dan decided to open his own place, with his wife’s money.

422
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:20,847
He stole your idea.

423
00:29:21,686 --> 00:29:24,611
Well you know, he had a family by then and…

424
00:29:24,852 --> 00:29:27,377
I hoped he would do right by his other son Lucas.

425
00:29:27,853 --> 00:29:30,300
So, I taught him everything I knew about cars.

426
00:29:30,909 --> 00:29:32,917
Well that was pretty selfless of you.

427
00:29:33,168 --> 00:29:36,653
Yeah well, I’d never have done it if I knew what an ass he was gonna become.

428
00:29:37,540 --> 00:29:40,663
Well, being a good guy has its own rewards.

429
00:30:00,703 --> 00:30:01,723
How were the auditions?

430
00:30:01,825 --> 00:30:04,262
You should not have given that music to Peyton.

431
00:30:04,372 --> 00:30:08,437
- She liked it didn’t she? 
- Yeah! But I’m mad!

432
00:30:08,528 --> 00:30:10,433
Hales, you wouldn’t hear it from me.

433
00:30:10,939 --> 00:30:14,155
Besides, I’m supposed to believe in you when you don’t believe in yourself.

434
00:30:14,816 --> 00:30:16,548
It’s what you’ve always done for me.

435
00:30:19,218 --> 00:30:20,812
Okay, I’m not mad anymore.

436
00:30:21,457 --> 00:30:22,686
So then you’ll play?

437
00:30:26,506 --> 00:30:30,401
I will, okay, maybe I will. Um, you know, when you get back form camp this fall?

438
00:30:31,826 --> 00:30:34,267
Yeah, about… camp.

439
00:30:36,549 --> 00:30:37,887
I didn’t get in.

440
00:30:39,210 --> 00:30:41,851
Well, what do you mean? They said it was a sure thing!

441
00:30:41,918 --> 00:30:45,870
Yeah I know but… it turns out they made a mistake and...

442
00:30:46,003 --> 00:30:47,985
there’s some other kid they have to give the spot to.

443
00:30:49,598 --> 00:30:52,204
- I’m sorry. 
- Yeah, me too.

444
00:30:53,587 --> 00:30:57,805
But hey, since I can’t go to this camp, that means you… can start playing your music now.

445
00:30:59,137 --> 00:31:00,431
Tell me that you will.

446
00:31:03,859 --> 00:31:04,907
Okay.

447
00:31:09,793 --> 00:31:11,599
Okay. I’ll try.

448
00:31:14,738 --> 00:31:16,480
- Oh did you see it! 
- No.

449
00:31:17,170 --> 00:31:19,859
Oh, blink and you’ll miss it.

450
00:33:31,462 --> 00:33:33,832
The meteors always streak from north to south.

451
00:33:34,518 --> 00:33:35,717
Right near Percius.

452
00:33:36,669 --> 00:33:37,504
Where’s that?

453
00:33:39,306 --> 00:33:40,591
Next to Andromeda.

454
00:33:42,106 --> 00:33:45,065
He’s protecting his wife. Right there, you see the figure of a woman?

455
00:33:45,553 --> 00:33:48,337
Oh, yeah. I see it now.

456
00:33:49,204 --> 00:33:52,741
She’s chained at the wrist, just like in the story.

457
00:33:54,981 --> 00:33:58,942
Um, it’s late. We should get back home.

458
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:02,398
Well, we’ve had a lot to drink. Maybe we should spend the night here.

459
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:03,536
I don’t have my things.

460
00:34:05,932 --> 00:34:08,982
I threw our overnight bags in the car. Just in case.

461
00:34:13,273 --> 00:34:15,474
I’ll take the guest room, of course.

462
00:34:23,581 --> 00:34:24,498
So.

463
00:34:25,450 --> 00:34:27,733
What time do you wanna sneak around tomorrow night?

464
00:34:30,114 --> 00:34:32,899
I’m gonna talk to him, okay? I promise.

465
00:34:33,570 --> 00:34:35,573
You understand where I’m coming from though, right?

466
00:34:36,361 --> 00:34:40,667
I mean, at a certain point, I gotta stop talking about wanting to be a different guy…

467
00:34:41,656 --> 00:34:43,089
and start being that guy.

468
00:34:44,216 --> 00:34:45,654
I do understand.

469
00:34:46,833 --> 00:34:51,286
And… I know you think you have to work at it, but you’re already a good guy, Luke.

470
00:34:52,039 --> 00:34:53,340
At least I think so.

471
00:35:17,539 --> 00:35:19,105
Get anything at the mall?

472
00:35:19,618 --> 00:35:20,436
Not really.

473
00:35:23,155 --> 00:35:24,185
That’s a first.

474
00:35:25,793 --> 00:35:27,006
I went out with a friend.

475
00:35:27,942 --> 00:35:29,269
You kiss all your friends?

476
00:35:30,615 --> 00:35:33,078
- You’ve been spying on me? 
- So you like Lucas?

477
00:35:34,124 --> 00:35:36,453
I don’t know Felix. It was just a first date.

478
00:35:37,185 --> 00:35:40,037
Half of the kids in this town were conceived on the first date.

479
00:35:41,210 --> 00:35:43,048
Look, I don’t know how much you know about him…

480
00:35:43,217 --> 00:35:44,698
but he’s done some things.

481
00:35:45,362 --> 00:35:48,731
That’s no secret. He told me that he screwed some things up!

482
00:35:48,829 --> 00:35:52,080
Yeah, Peyton – while he was dating Brooke.

483
00:35:54,831 --> 00:35:58,313
Look, he’ll do the same thing to you Anna. He’s a bad guy.

484
00:35:58,568 --> 00:36:01,707
No, he might have made a mistake but he’s not a bad guy.

485
00:36:01,789 --> 00:36:03,801
And I’m willing to give him the benefit of the doubt.

486
00:36:03,888 --> 00:36:05,869
It’s be nice if you’d do the same for me.

487
00:36:07,636 --> 00:36:11,159
See, that’s how guys like that get away with this stuff.

488
00:36:11,491 --> 00:36:14,728
Girls like you, giving them the benefit of the doubt.

489
00:36:24,808 --> 00:36:29,791
Oh! You just took ten years off my life.

490
00:36:29,889 --> 00:36:31,302
It’s one o’clock in the morning.

491
00:36:32,197 --> 00:36:34,682
I have been worried sick. Where have you been?

492
00:36:35,076 --> 00:36:39,925
- I’m sorry, it just...
- No, after midnight, you call.

493
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:45,909
I really hope I don’t sound like that!

494
00:36:47,544 --> 00:36:48,957
How long have you been home?

495
00:36:49,101 --> 00:36:50,561
Oh, bout five minutes.

496
00:36:51,042 --> 00:36:52,572
Well then we’re both grounded.

497
00:36:53,238 --> 00:36:54,881
Clearly a rookie mom.

498
00:36:54,974 --> 00:36:57,467
Next time, try sneaking in the window.

499
00:36:59,623 --> 00:37:00,846
So, did you have a good time?

500
00:37:03,010 --> 00:37:04,377
Yeah, I did.

501
00:37:07,128 --> 00:37:07,918
Good.

502
00:37:15,426 --> 00:37:17,262
Hey. I’m making pancakes.

503
00:37:17,666 --> 00:37:20,170
Oh, I’m sorry, Dan, I’m going home.

504
00:37:21,512 --> 00:37:23,678
What’s the hurry? We’ll go back in a few hours.

505
00:37:24,057 --> 00:37:25,454
Oh, no we won’t.

506
00:37:25,875 --> 00:37:30,180
Coming out here was a mistake. I can’t… keep pretending that things are normal.

507
00:37:31,056 --> 00:37:33,708
You’re better now, so…

508
00:37:34,805 --> 00:37:36,684
I’ll send your things over.

509
00:37:40,176 --> 00:37:41,163
It’s the doctor.

510
00:37:43,493 --> 00:37:45,910
- Dan Scott! 
- Hi Dan, this is Doctor Connelly.

511
00:37:45,983 --> 00:37:49,223
I just received your test results back from the lab. You’re doing really well

512
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:52,358
and we can now start talking about a more strenuous exercise programme.

513
00:37:53,334 --> 00:37:54,112
I see.

514
00:37:54,185 --> 00:37:55,799
So call my office and set up an appointment.

515
00:37:55,869 --> 00:37:58,127
Thank you doctor, I will. Thank you.

516
00:38:04,053 --> 00:38:05,402
It’s not good.

517
00:38:05,956 --> 00:38:07,897
I’m gonna have to stay with you for a while.

518
00:38:10,566 --> 00:38:11,362
Come in!

519
00:38:11,819 --> 00:38:12,946
- Hey man. 
- Hey.

520
00:38:13,274 --> 00:38:16,882
Wanna help me with this table? I’m rearranging so Haley has more room to practice.

521
00:38:17,257 --> 00:38:19,899
- Yeah man, where do you want it? 
- Right there.

522
00:38:21,604 --> 00:38:25,379
So Haley told me you didn’t get into ‘High Flyers’ after all. Tough break.

523
00:38:25,465 --> 00:38:26,812
Yeah, it’s too bad.

524
00:38:28,045 --> 00:38:29,253
You did get in.

525
00:38:31,343 --> 00:38:34,994
Nathan, man you’ve been working for your whole life for this.

526
00:38:36,217 --> 00:38:37,549
You can’t say no.

527
00:38:38,510 --> 00:38:40,626
You know what it’s like to hit a game winning shot.

528
00:38:41,322 --> 00:38:45,393
The whole crowd loves you… everybody treats you like you’re a star.

529
00:38:47,093 --> 00:38:50,965
I get to feel that every time I play. I mean, you know, you’ve felt it.

530
00:38:51,711 --> 00:38:55,807
Now, it’s Haley’s turn. I mean she’s an incredible musician, Luke,

531
00:38:55,925 --> 00:38:57,824
and she’s ready to give it a shot.

532
00:38:58,270 --> 00:39:00,611
So if I got to camp now, for three months,

533
00:39:01,210 --> 00:39:02,890
who knows where her head’s gonna be.

534
00:39:04,322 --> 00:39:07,728
I just really want her to feel, like, the thrill of the crowd.

535
00:39:08,839 --> 00:39:09,959
She deserves it.

536
00:39:11,076 --> 00:39:12,433
Well what about your future?

537
00:39:13,985 --> 00:39:15,511
I already know my future.

538
00:39:16,678 --> 00:39:17,938
It’s with Haley.

539
00:39:36,975 --> 00:39:38,465
Welcome to ‘TRIC’.

540
00:39:44,809 --> 00:39:47,261
- Nice space. 
- Oh, Rick.

541
00:39:47,339 --> 00:39:52,356
Here you’re looking for bands. Suppose we’re working together after all.

542
00:39:54,963 --> 00:39:58,071
I guess… we’ll be partying together too.

543
00:40:09,392 --> 00:40:10,374
Mouth!

544
00:40:11,291 --> 00:40:14,189
I… I knew this meant a lot to you.

545
00:40:14,555 --> 00:40:18,214
So, I got the address off the woman’s cheque and…

546
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:19,674
I bought it back.

547
00:40:30,333 --> 00:40:31,512
Thank you.

548
00:40:34,031 --> 00:40:34,743
Yeah!

549
00:40:34,810 --> 00:40:37,097
Hey Dan, Milt West from ‘High Flyers’.

550
00:40:37,742 --> 00:40:39,832
Uh… your son, turned me down.

551
00:40:40,350 --> 00:40:43,171
So, what? You saying he’s not going to the camp?

552
00:40:43,421 --> 00:40:44,911
You told me you could make this happen.

553
00:40:45,019 --> 00:40:48,209
Says he doesn’t wanna be away from his wife. Sorry.

554
00:41:09,961 --> 00:41:13,473
So I… I want you to know that I met somebody.

555
00:41:14,717 --> 00:41:16,975
Well that’s cool. So did I.

556
00:41:18,117 --> 00:41:20,246
Well, mine’s younger than me.

557
00:41:20,909 --> 00:41:22,530
I mean a lot younger.

558
00:41:24,905 --> 00:41:25,966
Okay.

559
00:41:26,596 --> 00:41:29,074
Well if he’s younger than me, I’m not calling him dad.

560
00:41:32,391 --> 00:41:34,517
Oh, this came for you.

561
00:42:18,259 --> 00:42:22,812
