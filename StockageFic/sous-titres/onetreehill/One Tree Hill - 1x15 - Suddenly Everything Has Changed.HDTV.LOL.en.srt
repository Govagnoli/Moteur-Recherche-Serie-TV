1
00:01:40,582 --> 00:01:43,928
Hey, easy there tough guy, you’ll pop a stitch.

2
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:45,863
It’s just a drawer, Mom. I’m not helpless.

3
00:01:45,935 --> 00:01:48,059
You will be if you keep this up. What are you looking for?

4
00:01:48,136 --> 00:01:49,432
The book Keith dropped off.

5
00:01:54,971 --> 00:01:55,805
I don’t get it.

6
00:01:56,834 --> 00:01:59,338
You know, Dan does one decent thing and you cut him some slack.

7
00:01:59,467 --> 00:02:03,029
And yet Keith makes one mistake and you cut him out.

8
00:02:04,781 --> 00:02:05,949
How are we doing today?

9
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,470
Like I had my spleen ripped out.

10
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:10,239
You’ll be sore for a while.

11
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:11,980
What about basketball?

12
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:13,790
Will I get it back?

13
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:15,550
The way it was?

14
00:02:17,028 --> 00:02:18,881
Your shoulder was pretty badly damaged.

15
00:02:18,953 --> 00:02:20,714
Full recovery may not be possible.

16
00:02:33,455 --> 00:02:35,185
- It’s him.
- Don’t pick up.

17
00:02:37,135 --> 00:02:40,663
Your father is refusing to cooperate with the attorneys.

18
00:02:40,726 --> 00:02:44,099
So, this custody thing may end up in front of a judge.

19
00:02:44,196 --> 00:02:47,345
If that happens, things could get ugly, sweetie.

20
00:02:47,422 --> 00:02:51,309
But I want you to know, I’m only trying to protect you.

21
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:54,456
Nathan.

22
00:02:58,532 --> 00:03:00,765
How great is it that dad has an off button now?

23
00:03:02,454 --> 00:03:04,938
Look, Mom, I think you’re doing the right thing for yourself.

24
00:03:06,463 --> 00:03:09,341
- Even for him.
- It’s you I’m worried about, Honey.

25
00:03:09,392 --> 00:03:11,015
Well don’t. I get it.

26
00:03:11,845 --> 00:03:13,769
You and dad splitting up is a good thing.

27
00:03:17,169 --> 00:03:19,832
The nurse said you set a new VWU record.

28
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:22,115
Visitors While Unconscious.

29
00:03:23,062 --> 00:03:27,158
You know, Whitey came to see you, and Deb, and the guys from the River Court.

30
00:03:28,796 --> 00:03:30,103
Anybody else from school?

31
00:03:31,086 --> 00:03:31,844
Peyton?

32
00:03:32,330 --> 00:03:35,761
Once. I saw her holding your hand and talking to you.

33
00:03:37,337 --> 00:03:38,642
And she never came back?

34
00:03:39,211 --> 00:03:40,905
I don’t think so, why?

35
00:03:42,427 --> 00:03:43,322
Surprise!

36
00:03:47,618 --> 00:03:48,760
Oh wow.

37
00:03:49,267 --> 00:03:49,998
What?

38
00:03:51,452 --> 00:03:52,430
Bad idea?

39
00:03:54,392 --> 00:03:58,335
No, no, you just surprised me.

40
00:03:58,784 --> 00:04:01,652
Then mission accomplished. I Fung Swayed your room.

41
00:04:01,836 --> 00:04:03,320
It promotes healing.

42
00:04:04,324 --> 00:04:06,558
I just wanted to say, Welcome Home, Boyfriend.

43
00:04:13,055 --> 00:04:14,529
Can we have a minute, Mom?

44
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:17,801
Keep it short, you need to be in bed.

45
00:04:21,656 --> 00:04:24,939
Hey, I want you to know I’m here for you. Whatever you need.

46
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:29,342
And if she’s not home, I might even give you a sponge bath.

47
00:04:29,762 --> 00:04:31,933
Actually, I can’t do that for a while.

48
00:04:31,994 --> 00:04:32,583
What?

49
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:36,991
- Bathe? 
- No. You know. Sex.

50
00:04:37,073 --> 00:04:40,037
Oh. That sucks.

51
00:04:40,387 --> 00:04:42,936
A little cardio might just be what you need though.

52
00:04:44,774 --> 00:04:45,685
What?

53
00:04:46,545 --> 00:04:49,106
I’m just going to need some time to figure some stuff out.

54
00:04:49,469 --> 00:04:52,372
Whatever you need, I’m here for you.

55
00:04:52,986 --> 00:04:56,458
Yeah, see that’s the thing.

56
00:05:03,452 --> 00:05:05,213
Are you breaking up with me?

57
00:05:05,826 --> 00:05:08,279
I just think it’s the best thing for right now.

58
00:05:14,321 --> 00:05:15,443
Maybe for you.

59
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,877
Brooke, I’m sorry.

60
00:05:21,146 --> 00:05:22,943
Apparently not enough.

61
00:05:33,071 --> 00:05:35,970
Dan, Deb has made it more than clear that she intends to divorce you.

62
00:05:36,046 --> 00:05:36,932
Or murder me.

63
00:05:37,881 --> 00:05:39,901
Did she tell you she threatened to stab me in my sleep?

64
00:05:39,976 --> 00:05:41,550
It was a figure of speech.

65
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:43,316
Your client’s trying to shut me out of my son’s life

66
00:05:43,367 --> 00:05:45,077
- and I won’t let that happen.
- Dan.

67
00:05:45,128 --> 00:05:47,306
And you know you can’t throw me out of the house without a court order.

68
00:05:47,357 --> 00:05:48,391
You already moved out.

69
00:05:48,456 --> 00:05:52,318
That’s because I was threatened with physical bodily harm. I did what I had to do to protect myself.

70
00:05:52,410 --> 00:05:56,563
And now that things have calmed down, I don’t know. Maybe I’ll move back in.

71
00:05:56,674 --> 00:06:01,502
I’ll get a restraining order. I’ll prove what an abusive son of a bitch you really are.

72
00:06:02,133 --> 00:06:04,871
The gloves are coming off, huh, Deb? Fine.

73
00:06:05,076 --> 00:06:07,637
See, you’re calling the shots here, I’m just following the lead.

74
00:06:12,808 --> 00:06:15,009
All that stuff from your past may have to come out, Deb.

75
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,689
Do you really want to do that to Nathan?

76
00:06:16,725 --> 00:06:18,506
No, Deb the question is, do you?

77
00:06:30,277 --> 00:06:31,905
You have one message.

78
00:06:33,282 --> 00:06:35,874
Hey it’s me. Peyton. Where are you?

79
00:06:36,145 --> 00:06:38,203
I really want to see you. Give me a call.

80
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:24,847
Lucas. Lucas?

81
00:07:25,822 --> 00:07:28,185
- What hurts the most? 
- All of it.

82
00:07:29,686 --> 00:07:32,031
So you broke up with Brooke to be with Peyton?

83
00:07:32,839 --> 00:07:33,741
You think that’s wrong?

84
00:07:33,807 --> 00:07:36,490
Oh I’m not in any position to judge, I just...

85
00:07:38,058 --> 00:07:40,382
but the heart wants what it wants. Right?

86
00:07:41,478 --> 00:07:43,208
At least Brooke knows the truth now.

87
00:07:44,959 --> 00:07:47,755
Anyway, I should let you get some rest.

88
00:07:51,341 --> 00:07:52,874
- You look good.
- Thank you.

89
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:56,167
By the way, you’re lucky you didn’t die cause I would have killed you.

90
00:07:57,427 --> 00:07:58,481
I love you too.

91
00:08:02,224 --> 00:08:03,038
Peyton?

92
00:08:03,444 --> 00:08:04,993
Hey, I’m going to go elsewhere

93
00:08:11,808 --> 00:08:13,764
I was so afraid you weren’t going to wake up.

94
00:08:13,841 --> 00:08:17,072
What? And miss out on being with you?

95
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:28,598
When you never came to the hospital,

96
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:34,399
I started to worry that maybe you changed your mind.

97
00:08:35,131 --> 00:08:39,579
No, it was just all too weird with Brooke there.

98
00:08:45,108 --> 00:08:48,163
I started to tell her about us, the night of you accident,

99
00:08:48,207 --> 00:08:50,361
but then Haley called and everything changed.

100
00:08:50,773 --> 00:08:51,673
I  figured.

101
00:08:53,858 --> 00:08:55,902
That’s why I ended things with Brooke today.

102
00:08:56,741 --> 00:08:57,632
You did?

103
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:01,130
Did you tell her why?

104
00:09:01,918 --> 00:09:04,329
I told her I needed to focus on getting well.

105
00:09:05,708 --> 00:09:07,243
Maybe I should tell her the rest.

106
00:09:08,097 --> 00:09:12,193
Sure, could you just give me a few days to straighten up? Okay?

107
00:09:13,361 --> 00:09:16,111
Then we’ll tell her together. Like we said.

108
00:09:16,291 --> 00:09:21,364
Besides, we’re not exactly going to be dating in the mean time, you know?

109
00:10:00,730 --> 00:10:03,298
Am I going to have to tie you to your bed to make you rest?

110
00:10:03,385 --> 00:10:04,214
I’m  sorry.

111
00:10:06,773 --> 00:10:10,097
The next time you leave the house, I’ll be cashing in your life insurance.

112
00:10:18,306 --> 00:10:19,819
Want to tell me what’s going on?

113
00:10:21,439 --> 00:10:22,181
What do you mean?

114
00:10:23,087 --> 00:10:25,442
Brooke’s waiting for you when you get home from the hospital.

115
00:10:25,488 --> 00:10:27,530
Peyton’s there when I show up after work.

116
00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:31,386
What happened when I went to Italy? I thought you were interested in Peyton.

117
00:10:32,017 --> 00:10:33,065
I was.

118
00:10:34,674 --> 00:10:36,111
It just got too complicated.

119
00:10:37,321 --> 00:10:39,742
You know, I don’t know where she stood with me, and

120
00:10:40,868 --> 00:10:42,271
so I started dating Brooke.

121
00:10:42,891 --> 00:10:45,820
You know, when I first met Brooke I thought she was a little nutty.

122
00:10:47,496 --> 00:10:50,417
But the way she looked after you. She proved me wrong.

123
00:10:50,817 --> 00:10:53,270
She’s crazy about you and I think that’s a good thing.

124
00:10:53,356 --> 00:10:55,589
Actually I broke up with Brooke yesterday.

125
00:10:55,798 --> 00:10:57,325
What? Why?

126
00:10:57,438 --> 00:10:59,019
I’d rather not talk about it.

127
00:11:00,647 --> 00:11:01,354
Okay.

128
00:11:03,084 --> 00:11:04,995
But when you want to I’m here, alright?

129
00:11:11,611 --> 00:11:15,024
Peyton, what’s the matter?

130
00:11:19,273 --> 00:11:23,723
Peyton? I looked all over for you. You didn’t get my messages?

131
00:11:23,943 --> 00:11:27,758
Really? Oh no, my phone’s been whacked out all day.

132
00:11:28,311 --> 00:11:29,246
Are you okay?

133
00:11:30,115 --> 00:11:31,956
Not really, no.

134
00:11:33,681 --> 00:11:37,563
I said I wasn’t going to do this and I said that it wasn’t worth it but it is.

135
00:11:37,767 --> 00:11:39,482
Lucas broke up with me.

136
00:11:40,144 --> 00:11:41,254
I’m sorry.

137
00:11:41,341 --> 00:11:44,424
I was looking forward to getting a chance to show him how much he means to me

138
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:47,889
and he said he just wants to be friends.

139
00:11:48,473 --> 00:11:51,494
And every idiot knows that that’s just code for go away.

140
00:11:52,077 --> 00:11:53,630
I don’t know what I’m supposed to do.

141
00:11:54,004 --> 00:11:56,456
Look, if Lucas said he wants to be friends, I’m sure he means it.

142
00:11:56,999 --> 00:11:58,831
How do you do that with Lucas?

143
00:12:00,849 --> 00:12:06,947
You just sort of do everything that you’ve been doing without the sex part.

144
00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:12,300
There’s a first time for everything, right?

145
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:19,750
Wait a minute, is this…

146
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:21,350
What?

147
00:12:22,537 --> 00:12:23,766
Is this a new outfit?

148
00:12:24,045 --> 00:12:28,272
He noticed. Yes, it is, it’s all part of the new me.

149
00:12:29,103 --> 00:12:29,941
Do you like?

150
00:12:30,565 --> 00:12:32,787
Yeah but what’s wrong with the old you?

151
00:12:33,064 --> 00:12:35,900
Nothing, I just thought I’d branch out into some new things.

152
00:12:36,711 --> 00:12:38,461
This could be good. Like what?

153
00:12:38,665 --> 00:12:41,333
I don’t know, there’s a lot of stuff I wanted to try that I never did.

154
00:12:41,384 --> 00:12:42,521
Like fooling around with me.

155
00:12:44,153 --> 00:12:45,552
Like snowboarding.

156
00:12:45,721 --> 00:12:47,385
Okay, well I can teach you how to do that too.

157
00:12:47,441 --> 00:12:49,023
Yeah? Cool.

158
00:12:49,115 --> 00:12:49,791
What else?

159
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:52,720
- Singing. 
- Do you sing?

160
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:56,837
I, no, I mean I sing when no one’s around.

161
00:12:57,620 --> 00:12:59,524
Well, I think you should sing for me sometime.

162
00:12:59,894 --> 00:13:03,293
Okay, right yeah. I’ll catch you on the slopes.

163
00:13:08,113 --> 00:13:14,681
You know, I don’t know how I’d deal with all this crap with my parents if you weren’t around.

164
00:13:14,875 --> 00:13:15,684
Well you’re welcome.

165
00:13:15,945 --> 00:13:20,000
I’m serious. It’s like the worst things get with my parents.

166
00:13:20,144 --> 00:13:21,742
The better things get with you.

167
00:13:22,821 --> 00:13:24,598
Are things really awful with your parents?

168
00:13:24,689 --> 00:13:25,602
It’s a war zone.

169
00:13:26,774 --> 00:13:29,150
And I’m stuck with whoever’s got the best lawyer.

170
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:32,485
Oh that’s… you should know your rights.

171
00:13:32,887 --> 00:13:36,170
- It’s not like I have any.
- No, you do, let’s find out.

172
00:13:36,772 --> 00:13:37,803
Knowledge is power.

173
00:13:46,056 --> 00:13:46,968
What’s that?

174
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:49,645
This is a playstation 2.

175
00:13:51,657 --> 00:13:53,566
From the team. Even Nathan kicked in.

176
00:13:54,023 --> 00:13:57,848
We got you NBA Shoot Out, and NCAA Final 4.

177
00:13:58,190 --> 00:13:59,732
Keep you in the game till you get back.

178
00:13:59,814 --> 00:14:03,382
Yeah, well the doctor says I might not be back.

179
00:14:03,465 --> 00:14:06,802
Well don’t listen to them. I mean ultimately, that’s up to you, right?

180
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:07,898
I guess so.

181
00:14:09,338 --> 00:14:13,259
Hey, so I had a… I had a question for you.

182
00:14:13,315 --> 00:14:15,532
Do you know if your mom’s hiring at the café?

183
00:14:15,594 --> 00:14:18,615
Because I have to get a part time job and I was thinking maybe…

184
00:14:18,712 --> 00:14:19,680
You want me to talk to her?

185
00:14:19,746 --> 00:14:22,357
You know if you wanted to put in a good word for me, that’s cool.

186
00:14:25,671 --> 00:14:26,914
You’re popular today, huh?

187
00:14:27,984 --> 00:14:28,731
Keith.

188
00:14:33,811 --> 00:14:35,397
- It’s good to see you.
- You too.

189
00:14:36,771 --> 00:14:37,766
Hey Jake.

190
00:14:38,490 --> 00:14:39,606
Glad to see you’re okay.

191
00:14:40,779 --> 00:14:44,496
Anyway, I got to head out so, hang in there, Luke.

192
00:14:44,624 --> 00:14:45,632
Tell the team thanks for me.

193
00:14:50,459 --> 00:14:51,500
So where’ve you been?

194
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:56,292
I was just waiting for a chance when your mom wouldn’t be here.

195
00:14:59,345 --> 00:15:00,297
So how you doing?

196
00:15:00,982 --> 00:15:01,771
Alive.

197
00:15:04,101 --> 00:15:05,392
You look pretty banged up.

198
00:15:05,473 --> 00:15:06,626
I got off easy.

199
00:15:08,591 --> 00:15:13,444
Luke, I... I want you to know how sorry I am about what happened.

200
00:15:13,507 --> 00:15:15,427
I  know that. Keith, come on.

201
00:15:15,483 --> 00:15:16,758
I should have had those beers.

202
00:15:17,348 --> 00:15:20,281
I just freaked out about your mom coming home.

203
00:15:21,143 --> 00:15:23,102
I just kept thinking, what if Italy changed her?

204
00:15:23,164 --> 00:15:28,561
What if after having that experience she doesn’t want to settle for a guy with permanent grease stains?

205
00:15:29,292 --> 00:15:30,858
It happened. Alright?

206
00:15:32,277 --> 00:15:35,298
- I know you weren’t drunk, so…
- Yeah, I wish your mom believed that.

207
00:15:35,355 --> 00:15:38,754
She’ll get over it. I’m working on her.

208
00:15:40,991 --> 00:15:45,614
So Dan actually saved me, huh?

209
00:15:45,743 --> 00:15:51,724
Yeah. I have to say most of the time he’s an ass but that night, he was definitely a hero.

210
00:15:53,290 --> 00:15:54,739
Where am I supposed to put that?

211
00:15:55,768 --> 00:15:57,288
Just be grateful, I guess.

212
00:16:02,813 --> 00:16:09,285
Hey. I was just leaving.

213
00:16:10,382 --> 00:16:11,297
I’ll see ya.

214
00:16:13,531 --> 00:16:15,326
- Mom.
- Get back in bed.

215
00:16:20,969 --> 00:16:25,111
Well, I can’t pay unless I make the repair and I cant’ make the repair unless you send me the part.

216
00:16:26,657 --> 00:16:29,714
Cash up front? Since when?

217
00:16:32,224 --> 00:16:34,239
Alright, fine, fine.

218
00:16:35,007 --> 00:16:35,858
Bye.

219
00:16:42,150 --> 00:16:43,835
Here’s the stuff you left at the house.

220
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:46,543
You didn’t need to do that.

221
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:49,856
And I’m going to pay you back. Every penny of Lucas’ medical bills.

222
00:16:49,918 --> 00:16:51,895
It may take me a while, but I’ll get the money to you.

223
00:16:52,089 --> 00:16:53,471
It wasn’t a loan, Karen.

224
00:16:53,553 --> 00:16:54,566
Yes it was.

225
00:16:54,807 --> 00:16:55,872
I made a mistake.

226
00:16:56,159 --> 00:17:00,030
Keith, I nearly lost my son because of that mistake.

227
00:17:01,325 --> 00:17:02,165
I’m sorry

228
00:17:03,572 --> 00:17:05,271
but I can’t change what happened.

229
00:17:07,070 --> 00:17:08,385
I wish I could.

230
00:17:22,075 --> 00:17:22,979
What the hell?

231
00:17:25,496 --> 00:17:26,332
What do you want?

232
00:17:26,818 --> 00:17:28,277
What’d you do? Change the locks?

233
00:17:28,502 --> 00:17:29,812
My attorney’s advice.

234
00:17:29,879 --> 00:17:32,045
That’s great, would you open the door please? We need to talk.

235
00:17:32,107 --> 00:17:33,448
Not going to happen, Dan.

236
00:17:33,816 --> 00:17:36,014
You have something to say, you say it to my lawyer.

237
00:17:36,126 --> 00:17:38,281
- Damn it, Deb, open the…
- What’s going on?

238
00:17:38,348 --> 00:17:41,235
Your mother’s on crack, she changed the locks on my house. Will you open the damn door?

239
00:17:41,295 --> 00:17:42,880
No! You have to leave.

240
00:17:43,253 --> 00:17:45,608
Fine. Come on, Nathan, I’ll buy you breakfast.

241
00:17:47,610 --> 00:17:49,832
- Nathan.
- Hey do you mind? I need to talk to my son.

242
00:17:49,909 --> 00:17:52,670
- Yes I do mind. I mean it, Dan.
- Okay, this is what I’m talking about,

243
00:17:52,726 --> 00:17:55,966
- it’s sad to see that the lady…
- Stop! Stop!

244
00:17:56,473 --> 00:17:59,209
You guys don’t get to decide who I live with, alright? I do.

245
00:17:59,269 --> 00:18:01,936
- What are you talking about?
- Look it up. It’s not your decision.

246
00:18:02,049 --> 00:18:04,225
All I have to do is take my case to the judge.

247
00:18:05,279 --> 00:18:07,854
And right now I don’t know if I want to live with either of you two.

248
00:18:11,793 --> 00:18:12,878
Okay.

249
00:18:19,789 --> 00:18:21,213
Hey, I really appreciate this, Ms. Roe.

250
00:18:21,418 --> 00:18:23,057
Oh please, call me Karen.

251
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:26,390
And don’t worry about it. Lucas put in a good word for you.

252
00:18:30,205 --> 00:18:31,815
You got your first table.

253
00:18:45,514 --> 00:18:46,782
Everything okay, dad?

254
00:18:48,478 --> 00:18:52,410
You’re kidding, well I just started.

255
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:54,330
No...

256
00:18:56,275 --> 00:18:59,276
Okay, no, I know.

257
00:19:00,571 --> 00:19:01,341
Yeah.

258
00:19:02,739 --> 00:19:05,902
Ms. Roe? I’m really sorry about this but I got to go.

259
00:19:06,172 --> 00:19:07,140
Is something wrong?

260
00:19:07,202 --> 00:19:10,468
Well, my dad just got called into work so there’s no one to watch Jenny.

261
00:19:10,534 --> 00:19:11,446
Is that your sister?

262
00:19:12,352 --> 00:19:13,868
That’s my daughter.

263
00:19:14,478 --> 00:19:15,772
Lucas didn’t tell you?

264
00:19:16,309 --> 00:19:17,938
Apparently not.

265
00:19:18,138 --> 00:19:23,929
- I’m really sorry to do this but I…
- No it’s okay. Just give me a call.

266
00:19:24,426 --> 00:19:25,285
Okay.

267
00:19:38,961 --> 00:19:41,579
Where’ve you been? I’m going nuts!

268
00:19:44,204 --> 00:19:46,712
Sorry. Got a strip due.

269
00:19:56,542 --> 00:19:59,485
You could work on it here. I love to watch you draw.

270
00:20:05,608 --> 00:20:07,489
All my stuff is here.

271
00:20:12,237 --> 00:20:14,275
C’mon…. I miss you!

272
00:20:23,621 --> 00:20:25,866
I can’t. Sorry. Gotta go.

273
00:20:41,723 --> 00:20:42,562
Come in.

274
00:20:44,382 --> 00:20:45,251
Hi.

275
00:20:45,525 --> 00:20:48,010
Oh, Brooke. Hi.

276
00:20:48,870 --> 00:20:50,483
Lucas told you we broke up?

277
00:20:50,867 --> 00:20:52,019
Actually, yeah.

278
00:20:52,972 --> 00:20:57,417
Okay. I know he said he needed some space but I was on the internet

279
00:20:57,458 --> 00:21:01,712
and I found this website about Splenectomies and it recommended this herbal tea so,

280
00:21:01,958 --> 00:21:03,535
I picked some up for Lucas.

281
00:21:04,128 --> 00:21:05,439
That was very sweet of you.

282
00:21:06,627 --> 00:21:10,442
He’s asleep right now but I’ll brew him a cup when he wakes up.

283
00:21:12,561 --> 00:21:14,052
Will you tell him I said hi?

284
00:21:15,981 --> 00:21:16,802
Yeah.

285
00:21:20,047 --> 00:21:21,158
What is all this?

286
00:21:21,449 --> 00:21:24,767
Oh, I was putting together a scrapbook from my trip. You want to see?

287
00:21:25,361 --> 00:21:26,067
Great.

288
00:21:27,036 --> 00:21:31,046
I am sorry to put you through this, the divorce I mean.

289
00:21:31,777 --> 00:21:33,118
It’s a little late for that, Mom.

290
00:21:33,968 --> 00:21:36,759
And I know I wasn’t always there for you.

291
00:21:37,824 --> 00:21:41,561
I guess it was easier to avoid going head to head with your father.

292
00:21:41,786 --> 00:21:44,055
And I’m sorry you had to pay the price for that.

293
00:21:44,976 --> 00:21:45,826
Yeah.

294
00:21:46,077 --> 00:21:47,480
Can you tell me where you’re at?

295
00:21:47,941 --> 00:21:49,983
I’m kind of tired of all the lying and the fighting.

296
00:21:51,366 --> 00:21:53,045
I’m feeling like I’m caught in the middle of it all.

297
00:21:53,133 --> 00:21:56,215
That will end. As soon as the divorce is final.

298
00:21:56,390 --> 00:21:57,224
I just...

299
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:05,117
I want you to stay with me, Nate.

300
00:22:06,499 --> 00:22:08,063
Things  are going to change?

301
00:22:08,334 --> 00:22:09,619
I promise you.

302
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:13,552
Okay.

303
00:22:18,477 --> 00:22:19,757
I love you, Nathan.

304
00:22:20,244 --> 00:22:23,024
Yeah. You too.

305
00:22:29,772 --> 00:22:32,681
So did you ever actually do any cooking while you were there?

306
00:22:32,987 --> 00:22:35,731
Are you kidding? It was culinary boot camp.

307
00:22:36,474 --> 00:22:38,501
But we had our Sunday’s free.

308
00:22:39,008 --> 00:22:42,029
So it was all about fitting the entire country into 6 days.

309
00:22:43,370 --> 00:22:44,840
Where was this one taken?

310
00:22:44,916 --> 00:22:47,257
Oh that’s Piazza of San Marco in Venice.

311
00:22:48,193 --> 00:22:49,611
It was so beautiful.

312
00:22:51,025 --> 00:22:53,206
I’d love to go there someday.

313
00:22:54,824 --> 00:22:57,363
I don’t even know how to describe it, Brooke.

314
00:22:58,787 --> 00:23:01,593
I got to be an entirely different person for a little while.

315
00:23:03,205 --> 00:23:05,008
I almost didn’t want to come back.

316
00:23:05,131 --> 00:23:05,884
Yeah.

317
00:23:07,317 --> 00:23:10,542
When things are really special it makes it that much harder to let go.

318
00:23:10,863 --> 00:23:13,614
Lucas is going through a pretty tough time right now.

319
00:23:13,926 --> 00:23:14,774
I know.

320
00:23:15,405 --> 00:23:18,832
I’m hoping that maybe when he feels better he’ll take another chance on me.

321
00:23:50,101 --> 00:23:52,092
- Lucas, what are you…
- I wanted to see you.

322
00:23:52,128 --> 00:23:55,758
The doctor said you shouldn’t be out. What are you crazy?

323
00:23:55,952 --> 00:23:56,766
Probably.

324
00:23:58,902 --> 00:24:01,230
I just had to get out of there, you know?

325
00:24:06,695 --> 00:24:08,220
I can’t get you out of my head.

326
00:24:09,704 --> 00:24:13,192
I wish we could just fast forward these next 6 months.

327
00:24:15,689 --> 00:24:17,518
This messed up thing with Brooke.

328
00:24:19,956 --> 00:24:21,583
So we could just be together.

329
00:24:24,373 --> 00:24:25,475
What’s going on, Peyton?

330
00:24:26,473 --> 00:24:30,006
You sign off fast and… Ah...

331
00:24:31,134 --> 00:24:32,944
What? Are you okay?

332
00:24:33,189 --> 00:24:34,230
Can I just lay down?

333
00:24:37,122 --> 00:24:40,799
Lucas. Oh my God, you’re burning up.

334
00:24:43,848 --> 00:24:44,817
What are you doing?

335
00:24:45,628 --> 00:24:47,981
- I’m calling your mom.
- She’s with Brooke.

336
00:24:51,704 --> 00:24:53,433
Well, I should go check on Lucas.

337
00:24:53,801 --> 00:24:54,833
Will you let me?

338
00:24:55,006 --> 00:24:55,835
Yeah.

339
00:24:59,054 --> 00:24:59,887
Lucas?

340
00:25:04,883 --> 00:25:05,630
Hello?

341
00:25:06,486 --> 00:25:07,274
Peyton.

342
00:25:08,396 --> 00:25:09,297
What?!

343
00:25:09,968 --> 00:25:12,446
Can you get him to the emergency room, I’ll meet you there.

344
00:25:12,517 --> 00:25:16,198
Brooke. It’s Lucas. I got to go.

345
00:25:16,269 --> 00:25:17,341
Yeah, I’m coming with you.

346
00:25:27,339 --> 00:25:29,429
Hey. You’re back.

347
00:25:30,617 --> 00:25:31,892
How long was I out?

348
00:25:32,063 --> 00:25:33,193
Just a couple of minutes.

349
00:25:34,452 --> 00:25:37,549
- Luke, what are we going to do? 
- My God Lucas, are you alright?

350
00:25:39,795 --> 00:25:41,180
Yeah, I think so.

351
00:25:41,476 --> 00:25:43,555
The doctor said his fever’s going down.

352
00:25:43,775 --> 00:25:44,749
Where were you?

353
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:46,278
Peyton?

354
00:25:48,315 --> 00:25:50,344
I was down at the river court.

355
00:25:51,928 --> 00:25:54,584
I know I shouldn’t have but I had to get out.

356
00:25:56,518 --> 00:25:58,331
I guess I over did it.

357
00:25:59,570 --> 00:26:02,233
I started feeling pretty bad and Peyton drove by.

358
00:26:04,071 --> 00:26:06,693
So now that you guys are here I should probably go.

359
00:26:06,883 --> 00:26:07,820
Thank you, Peyton.

360
00:26:08,101 --> 00:26:10,659
Sure. I’ll see you guys later.

361
00:26:14,624 --> 00:26:18,033
- I’m sorry. 
- Yeah, you should be. Honestly, Lucas…

362
00:26:18,090 --> 00:26:22,207
Mom, just wait and not yell at me now. Until we get home.

363
00:26:22,401 --> 00:26:24,132
- You going to be okay? 
- Yeah.

364
00:26:36,218 --> 00:26:37,337
You want a drink?

365
00:26:39,635 --> 00:26:41,081
Since when do you let me drink?

366
00:26:42,057 --> 00:26:45,057
- You’re old enough. 
- Look, Dad...

367
00:26:45,104 --> 00:26:46,993
I know things haven’t been easy on you lately.

368
00:26:47,470 --> 00:26:53,178
To be honest, when you told us that it’s you who gets to choose who you’re staying with,

369
00:26:53,572 --> 00:26:55,380
- I was relieved.
- You were?

370
00:26:55,544 --> 00:27:00,110
Absolutely. Cause you’re a smart kid. And you know what’s best for you, right?

371
00:27:00,961 --> 00:27:04,131
Yeah, yeah and that’s why I came…

372
00:27:04,181 --> 00:27:05,871
You know I’ve been there for you your whole life.

373
00:27:06,290 --> 00:27:08,304
And I admit, sometimes too much.

374
00:27:09,556 --> 00:27:13,602
But, it’s only because I care about you.

375
00:27:14,524 --> 00:27:17,959
And I’ve been trying to pick up the slack for your mom whose been focused on her work all these years.

376
00:27:20,242 --> 00:27:21,940
I wish she wouldn’t go through with this.

377
00:27:23,044 --> 00:27:25,772
But she’s doing what she feels she has to do.

378
00:27:26,581 --> 00:27:29,070
- So I’m just going to have to do the same. 
- Meaning what?

379
00:27:29,634 --> 00:27:32,218
I’m going to have to make some tough choices where she’s concerned.

380
00:27:33,316 --> 00:27:37,184
But you should know, this is all in service of you.

381
00:27:37,237 --> 00:27:38,602
What are you planning on doing, Dad?

382
00:27:40,303 --> 00:27:43,591
She’s trying to steal you away from me, Nate. So I’m going to fight her.

383
00:27:44,117 --> 00:27:46,259
By making things as difficult for her as I can.

384
00:27:47,184 --> 00:27:50,184
And the sad part is, and you know how lawyers work,

385
00:27:50,486 --> 00:27:52,309
they’re going to make her out to be an unfit mother.

386
00:27:52,453 --> 00:27:56,528
By using all the time she was absent against her. And there’s other stuff as well.

387
00:27:56,651 --> 00:27:59,545
- What other stuff?
- Anything they can find out about her.

388
00:28:00,374 --> 00:28:03,974
- Like what, Dad? 
- Come stay with me, Nate.

389
00:28:04,465 --> 00:28:07,608
I’ll back off and let this divorce go through as quickly as possible.

390
00:28:07,762 --> 00:28:10,676
You’d be better off with me. You’d be doing your mother a favor as well.

391
00:28:11,284 --> 00:28:13,814
Dad look, I just want to know what you’re talking about.

392
00:28:14,173 --> 00:28:15,488
What other stuff with mom?

393
00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:18,857
Go live with her and find out.

394
00:28:23,756 --> 00:28:24,653
Sit down.

395
00:28:33,230 --> 00:28:36,583
Now, tell me why you and Peyton were really together.

396
00:28:37,055 --> 00:28:39,885
- I told you.
- Lucas, you’re lying to me.

397
00:28:39,974 --> 00:28:42,506
And you wouldn’t be unless you’re doing something you’re not proud of.

398
00:28:44,002 --> 00:28:45,677
I went to see Peyton.

399
00:28:47,786 --> 00:28:50,513
- We want to be together.
- Behind Brookes back?

400
00:28:50,576 --> 00:28:51,568
I broke up with Brooke.

401
00:28:51,625 --> 00:28:53,766
But apparently you didn’t tell her about Peyton.

402
00:28:54,243 --> 00:28:56,971
And that’s a shabby way to treat someone who’s really been there for you.

403
00:28:58,190 --> 00:28:59,910
Kind of like the way you’re treating Keith.

404
00:28:59,972 --> 00:29:01,323
Don’t change the subject.

405
00:29:01,389 --> 00:29:03,658
Mom I heard you talking to Brooke, about Italy.

406
00:29:04,672 --> 00:29:07,785
You know, I know you had this great time. It was amazing.

407
00:29:07,833 --> 00:29:10,340
But you know what I think you’re blaming Keith for taking that away from you.

408
00:29:10,417 --> 00:29:13,739
- I blame Keith for nearly killing you.
- No you weren’t there, Mom!

409
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:16,814
You don’t know how excited he was to see that you were coming home.

410
00:29:16,891 --> 00:29:17,528
Lucas.

411
00:29:17,595 --> 00:29:23,145
No, he had a couple of beers because he was nervous about you coming back the way you guys left things.

412
00:29:25,669 --> 00:29:26,938
He wasn’t drunk.

413
00:29:28,316 --> 00:29:31,679
Why are you pushing somebody out of your life who really and truly cares about you?

414
00:29:32,987 --> 00:29:34,337
Why are you?

415
00:29:44,894 --> 00:29:46,573
That doesn’t look like a yes face.

416
00:29:47,378 --> 00:29:52,371
I’m sorry Mr. Scott, your account history is working against your loan application.

417
00:29:52,498 --> 00:29:53,471
What does that mean?

418
00:29:53,666 --> 00:29:58,949
Well, given your average monthly income and what your new mortgage payment would be,

419
00:29:59,549 --> 00:30:01,320
it’s not a very reassuring picture.

420
00:30:01,366 --> 00:30:05,631
Well look, business is good. I mean, you know, it’s…

421
00:30:05,712 --> 00:30:09,736
We’re also concerned that withdrew virtually all of your savings.

422
00:30:09,937 --> 00:30:11,596
That’s usually a sign of trouble.

423
00:30:13,128 --> 00:30:16,286
Look, my nephew nearly died in a car accident.

424
00:30:16,987 --> 00:30:19,045
I paid the medical bills, I just…

425
00:30:20,110 --> 00:30:21,714
I wish I could help you.

426
00:30:28,083 --> 00:30:28,841
Hey.

427
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:31,744
Hey sweetie. I’m glad you brought Jenny.

428
00:30:31,821 --> 00:30:32,512
Yeah.

429
00:30:34,741 --> 00:30:37,883
Hey Ms. Roe. Can I talk to you for a sec?

430
00:30:37,959 --> 00:30:39,235
It’s Karen, remember?

431
00:30:39,936 --> 00:30:41,235
Oh, she’s beautiful.

432
00:30:42,328 --> 00:30:43,425
What’s up?

433
00:30:44,067 --> 00:30:48,593
Well look, I’m really sorry about this but I don’t think this is going to work out.

434
00:30:48,645 --> 00:30:52,450
Because now my mom, she’s got the flu, and you know she can’t watch Jenny

435
00:30:52,496 --> 00:30:54,476
and I can’t keep flaking out on you like this.

436
00:30:54,548 --> 00:30:56,657
It’s okay, Jake, I understand.

437
00:30:58,014 --> 00:30:59,310
Come here, I want to show you something.

438
00:31:10,239 --> 00:31:11,608
This was Lucas’.

439
00:31:11,963 --> 00:31:16,406
And I can’t throw anything away so, when you need to bring Jenny, it’s fine.

440
00:31:17,327 --> 00:31:18,413
You’d let me do that?

441
00:31:19,544 --> 00:31:22,232
I wasn’t much older than you when I had Lucas.

442
00:31:22,299 --> 00:31:24,479
I know how hard it is to ask for help.

443
00:31:25,043 --> 00:31:29,764
But sometimes it’s okay to have someone give you a hand.

444
00:31:30,931 --> 00:31:32,064
I don’t know what to say.

445
00:31:32,504 --> 00:31:35,652
Say thank you, and get to work.

446
00:31:46,026 --> 00:31:47,572
You were out late last night.

447
00:31:48,714 --> 00:31:50,259
There was some stuff I had to take care of.

448
00:31:50,331 --> 00:31:52,010
Try to remember to call, honey.

449
00:31:52,841 --> 00:31:53,889
What’s that?

450
00:31:53,993 --> 00:31:58,856
Look, mom, you and I both know that no matter what we do, no matter what happens,

451
00:31:59,328 --> 00:32:03,260
dad’s not going to let up until he wins. It’s just the way he’s wired.

452
00:32:04,448 --> 00:32:07,044
So I’m going to save us all one huge headache.

453
00:32:07,146 --> 00:32:09,491
Nathan, what did he say to you? What did he do?

454
00:32:09,854 --> 00:32:12,659
No mom, apparently the question is what did you do?

455
00:32:13,941 --> 00:32:17,898
If your father is threatening you, you have to tell me the truth.

456
00:32:17,959 --> 00:32:19,961
Why am I the only one who has to tell the truth around here?

457
00:32:20,032 --> 00:32:21,610
Nathan, what did he say?

458
00:32:22,013 --> 00:32:24,902
He told me that there’s some things that you don’t want people to know about you.

459
00:32:25,983 --> 00:32:27,938
And that he’d use it against you in court.

460
00:32:30,546 --> 00:32:32,322
Maybe you can tell me he’s bluffing.

461
00:32:34,875 --> 00:32:37,861
I made some mistakes in the past.

462
00:32:37,963 --> 00:32:40,841
- What kind of mistakes?
- The kind that should stay in the past.

463
00:32:41,276 --> 00:32:46,411
None of it had anything to do with you or how much I love you, Nathan, you have to trust me.

464
00:32:47,543 --> 00:32:48,787
I already tried that.

465
00:32:50,339 --> 00:32:52,658
I’ll be back later to get the rest of my stuff.

466
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:56,575
- Nathan please, listen to me.
- You want to keep your secrets, Mom? Fine.

467
00:32:57,578 --> 00:32:58,884
I’m gonna help you do that.

468
00:33:29,645 --> 00:33:32,379
Keith, you got a minute?

469
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,067
I don’t want to dance around this.

470
00:33:41,242 --> 00:33:42,850
- Dance around what?
- Us.

471
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:45,266
Where we’re at now.

472
00:33:47,063 --> 00:33:51,020
I left you with the most important thing in my life and you let me down

473
00:33:51,926 --> 00:33:54,447
at a time when I really thought we had something.

474
00:33:55,583 --> 00:33:56,454
We do.

475
00:33:58,718 --> 00:34:00,786
Those 6 weeks were amazing to me.

476
00:34:00,969 --> 00:34:03,469
For once I felt like I was in Lucas’ life in a real way.

477
00:34:03,554 --> 00:34:05,127
I mean you have to know how much that meant to me.

478
00:34:05,194 --> 00:34:08,778
- I don’t doubt that, but...
- I know. It doesn’t change what happened, right?

479
00:34:12,642 --> 00:34:14,164
I wasn’t drunk, Karen.

480
00:34:15,322 --> 00:34:16,411
I know that.

481
00:34:18,015 --> 00:34:19,806
But that’s not what this is about.

482
00:34:21,884 --> 00:34:23,211
Well, I want you to know,

483
00:34:24,012 --> 00:34:25,079
one of these days,

484
00:34:26,156 --> 00:34:28,863
you’re going to look at me and you’re going to see the person you used to see.

485
00:34:30,087 --> 00:34:31,951
Where does that leave us now?

486
00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:34,204
I guess it doesn’t.

487
00:34:47,784 --> 00:34:48,791
How you feeling?

488
00:34:49,831 --> 00:34:51,007
Okay, I guess.

489
00:34:53,020 --> 00:34:56,194
And not so okay.

490
00:34:57,682 --> 00:34:58,636
Me too.

491
00:35:14,651 --> 00:35:15,743
- Lucas.
- Peyton.

492
00:35:20,222 --> 00:35:24,425
When I saw you lying there in the hospital right after the accident

493
00:35:25,357 --> 00:35:30,315
all I could think about was how my mom wasn’t was luck as you.

494
00:35:31,430 --> 00:35:34,102
And then I remembered, after she died,

495
00:35:34,851 --> 00:35:37,963
it was Brooke who was there for me.

496
00:35:39,001 --> 00:35:43,448
We were just little kids and she would come over, every single day,

497
00:35:43,713 --> 00:35:45,141
to make sure I was okay.

498
00:35:46,827 --> 00:35:48,956
She’s been my best friend ever since.

499
00:35:54,142 --> 00:35:55,833
Well life’s short, Peyton.

500
00:35:56,897 --> 00:35:59,607
Too short to live it as a bad person.

501
00:36:01,608 --> 00:36:03,431
I cant betray her, Lucas.

502
00:36:04,255 --> 00:36:06,295
You mean even more than we already have.

503
00:36:11,133 --> 00:36:12,237
Peyton.

504
00:36:14,812 --> 00:36:15,887
I’m sorry.

505
00:36:18,366 --> 00:36:19,308
Me too.

506
00:36:23,578 --> 00:36:25,171
But it‘s better this way, right?

507
00:36:25,651 --> 00:36:26,353
Yeah.

508
00:36:46,536 --> 00:36:47,980
- Hey.
- Hey, you’re still here.

509
00:36:48,093 --> 00:36:49,163
How are you?

510
00:36:50,719 --> 00:36:53,464
I’m always here. Are you okay?

511
00:36:53,526 --> 00:36:56,550
Whatever I said last time you asked me that question probably still applies.

512
00:36:57,606 --> 00:37:00,284
Want to get some coffee? There’s some left if you want to talk about it.

513
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:02,746
Actually, I’m kind of tired of talking about it.

514
00:37:02,839 --> 00:37:03,710
Oh, okay.

515
00:37:04,411 --> 00:37:06,992
Well, if there’s anything I can do to help, let me know.

516
00:37:08,436 --> 00:37:12,784
Well, I was thinking about what you said, about living in the moment.

517
00:37:13,093 --> 00:37:15,925
Well, I realized, that if I’m going to live in the moment,

518
00:37:16,488 --> 00:37:18,720
then I just want to live in it with you.

519
00:37:29,803 --> 00:37:32,638
So were you serious? About doing something for me?

520
00:37:33,503 --> 00:37:36,011
Well, that depends. What is it?

521
00:37:37,849 --> 00:37:40,210
- Nathan… no.
- Here’s your chance.

522
00:37:40,522 --> 00:37:45,436
Come on, you said you do anything to help me and this would really help me take my mind off things.

523
00:37:47,323 --> 00:37:50,107
- You asked for it.
- Yeah, I did.

524
00:38:02,329 --> 00:38:05,504
I love the time and in between

525
00:38:06,967 --> 00:38:08,714
the calm inside me

526
00:38:08,770 --> 00:38:12,395
in the space where I can breathe

527
00:38:12,983 --> 00:38:15,503
I believe there is a

528
00:38:15,549 --> 00:38:18,610
distance I have wandered

529
00:38:18,826 --> 00:38:21,862
to touch upon the years of

530
00:38:22,274 --> 00:38:27,918
reaching out and reaching in

531
00:38:27,986 --> 00:38:33,981
holding out holding in

532
00:38:35,779 --> 00:38:38,549
I believe

533
00:38:38,771 --> 00:38:45,173
this is heaven to no one else but me

534
00:38:45,613 --> 00:38:51,666
and I'll defend it long as I can be

535
00:38:51,743 --> 00:38:56,649
left here to linger in silence

536
00:38:57,166 --> 00:38:59,899
if I choose to

537
00:39:00,755 --> 00:39:06,442
would you try to understand

538
00:39:08,752 --> 00:39:15,075
Oh the quiet child awaits the day when she can break free

539
00:39:15,352 --> 00:39:20,380
the mold that clings like desperation

540
00:39:20,737 --> 00:39:24,030
Mother don’t you see I've got

541
00:39:24,164 --> 00:39:30,959
to live my life the way I feel is right for me

542
00:39:31,070 --> 00:39:39,186
say it’s not right for you but it's right for me

543
00:39:40,892 --> 00:39:43,983
I believe

544
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:50,368
this is heaven to no one else but me

545
00:39:50,538 --> 00:39:54,023
and I'll defend it as long as

546
00:39:54,179 --> 00:40:01,373
I can be left here to linger in silence

547
00:40:01,940 --> 00:40:04,669
if I choose to

548
00:40:05,616 --> 00:40:10,735
would you try to understand

549
00:40:10,777 --> 00:40:11,692
Hey.

550
00:40:13,142 --> 00:40:14,299
You’re out late.

551
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:18,165
Lucky thing you finding Lucas like that.

552
00:40:20,387 --> 00:40:22,783
If you didn’t come along, who knows what might have happened.

553
00:40:24,412 --> 00:40:25,936
Everything turned out okay.

554
00:40:27,350 --> 00:40:28,850
No, not really.

555
00:40:31,077 --> 00:40:36,007
I don’t know what hurts worse, you and Lucas sneaking around behind my back

556
00:40:36,065 --> 00:40:38,364
or you lying about it to my face.

557
00:40:40,043 --> 00:40:41,440
- Brooke.
- No.

558
00:40:42,136 --> 00:40:46,258
The next time you want to steal my boyfriend, you might want to turn that thing off.

559
00:40:48,072 --> 00:40:52,787
I went into his room to check on him and his computer was on.

560
00:40:54,593 --> 00:40:56,351
I know you two were together.

561
00:40:58,807 --> 00:41:01,301
He meant everything to me, Peyton.

562
00:41:02,367 --> 00:41:05,719
And I was ready to try and be his friend if that’s what he needed.

563
00:41:12,647 --> 00:41:15,832
And now I don’t really care if I see either one of you again.
