00:00:09,678 --> 00:00:19,161
At this moment, there are 
6,502,867,120 people in the world.

2
00:00:24,366 --> 00:00:26,069
Give or take a few.

3
00:00:27,425 --> 00:00:31,105
And sometimes all you need is one...

4
00:00:32,050 --> 00:00:33,605
for better or for worse.

5
00:00:33,606 --> 00:00:35,855
Help me!

6
00:00:36,244 --> 00:00:39,357
Somebody, please help!

7
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:55,165
How long you been out here?

8
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:57,081
Couple hours.

9
00:00:57,082 --> 00:00:59,591
Sometimes I come out here when I can't sleep.

10
00:01:00,196 --> 00:01:01,330
You miss it?

11
00:01:02,182 --> 00:01:03,516
Every day.

12
00:01:11,217 --> 00:01:12,476
So, what's up?

13
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:15,402
Had this messed-up dream last night.

14
00:01:17,798 --> 00:01:20,113
Haley was drowning, and I couldn't save her.

15
00:01:20,456 --> 00:01:22,722
Of course, leave it to Haley to insist that we don't see each other

16
00:01:22,727 --> 00:01:25,082
until the wedding even though we're married.

17
00:01:25,725 --> 00:01:27,631
Maybe I should just go see her.

18
00:01:29,696 --> 00:01:32,340
I'll tell you what -- I'll go check on her for you, how's that?

19
00:01:32,476 --> 00:01:35,502
Tell her to stay away from the water, okay? No swimming or anything.

20
00:01:36,248 --> 00:01:40,763
Nathan... it's your wedding day -- again.

21
00:01:41,145 --> 00:01:42,732
It's gonna be a great day.

22
00:01:43,385 --> 00:01:44,342
Thanks, man.

23
00:02:00,207 --> 00:02:02,270
You're closer than a hundred feet.

24
00:02:04,167 --> 00:02:06,411
Just paying my respects.

25
00:02:08,655 --> 00:02:13,271
You know, everyone thinks of Keith as this perfect guy, but they're wrong.

26
00:02:13,275 --> 00:02:15,221
No, they're not, Dan.

27
00:02:15,655 --> 00:02:17,632
Keith is a hero.

28
00:02:23,345 --> 00:02:24,830
He tried to kill me.

29
00:02:26,996 --> 00:02:28,441
That's right.

30
00:02:28,726 --> 00:02:31,771
He's the one who tried to burn me in the dealership fire.

31
00:02:36,896 --> 00:02:40,400
So I guess the hero got what was coming to him after all.

32
00:02:49,005 --> 00:02:50,463
Knock, knock.

33
00:02:51,998 --> 00:02:56,701
Hey, how is the bride-to-be... again?

34
00:02:56,707 --> 00:02:57,903
Good.

35
00:02:58,137 --> 00:03:01,561
Well, I'm afraid you've missed the boys. They were gone pretty early.

36
00:03:01,575 --> 00:03:04,840
Oh, that's okay. I wanted to see you, actually.

37
00:03:05,056 --> 00:03:06,321
I have a question for you.

38
00:03:06,326 --> 00:03:07,532
Okay.

39
00:03:08,406 --> 00:03:13,803
I know you and Keith were engaged, and it -- it breaks my heart.

40
00:03:13,887 --> 00:03:16,062
I know. I know.

41
00:03:16,067 --> 00:03:18,090
Sorry. Okay. Um...

42
00:03:18,967 --> 00:03:23,370
Brooke -- Brooke made me this -- this dress,

43
00:03:23,378 --> 00:03:28,081
and it is out of the material that she ordered for your wedding dress.

44
00:03:28,085 --> 00:03:30,440
And I just wanted to ask you if it was okay if I wore it.

45
00:03:30,445 --> 00:03:33,091
And if it's not, that's fine. She made another one that I can wear.

46
00:03:33,095 --> 00:03:35,153
I am so proud of you, Haley.

47
00:03:35,386 --> 00:03:37,481
Have I told you that lately?

48
00:03:38,508 --> 00:03:42,953
You have got a wonderful soul, Haley James Scott.

49
00:03:43,275 --> 00:03:46,511
And you are gonna make a beautiful bride in that dress.

50
00:03:46,515 --> 00:03:47,823
Thank you.

51
00:03:58,635 --> 00:03:59,761
Hi.

52
00:04:01,268 --> 00:04:02,520
Where did you sleep?

53
00:04:02,525 --> 00:04:03,801
My car.

54
00:04:03,866 --> 00:04:07,283
See, I had this horrible dream last night

55
00:04:07,288 --> 00:04:12,023
that my best friend told me she had feelings for my boyfriend.

56
00:04:13,977 --> 00:04:15,753
But that wasn't a dream, was it?

57
00:04:20,357 --> 00:04:22,291
- Brooke --
- Why now, Peyton?

58
00:04:22,727 --> 00:04:25,632
Why would you tell me you have feelings for Lucas now,

59
00:04:25,636 --> 00:04:28,470
when I have so much going on in my life, stuff that you don't even know about?

60
00:04:28,476 --> 00:04:30,742
Well, so do I, okay? Trust me.

61
00:04:30,756 --> 00:04:34,433
But... I didn't wish for this, all right? I wished for Jake.

62
00:04:34,436 --> 00:04:35,550
Oh, right.

63
00:04:35,555 --> 00:04:41,013
You wished for Jake after you wished for Pete and then Lucas.

64
00:04:42,885 --> 00:04:45,053
I cannot believe this is happening again.

65
00:04:45,057 --> 00:04:48,192
It's not, okay? It's not. It's just... okay, the last time --

66
00:04:48,197 --> 00:04:51,691
The last time? Do you hear yourself right now?

67
00:04:51,705 --> 00:04:55,030
"The last time" you tried to steal my boyfriend?

68
00:04:55,037 --> 00:04:56,842
He's on the door, Peyton.

69
00:04:56,857 --> 00:04:59,550
He's on the damn door under me!

70
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:02,153
I don't want to steal him, okay?

71
00:05:02,155 --> 00:05:04,012
But you like him.

72
00:05:09,595 --> 00:05:12,970
Brooke, I'm not gonna do anything about it, okay? I'll just bury it.

73
00:05:12,976 --> 00:05:16,131
You can't, okay? It's out. It's like the time capsule.

74
00:05:16,136 --> 00:05:19,513
And you could've buried it and not said anything to me, so what is that about?

75
00:05:19,518 --> 00:05:22,902
I don't know, all right?! I wanted to be honest with you, all right?

76
00:05:22,905 --> 00:05:25,131
I didn't want to make the same mistake I did last time.

77
00:05:25,138 --> 00:05:29,103
You even said last night at Tric that you really didn't miss him.

78
00:05:30,525 --> 00:05:32,181
Don't you dare!

79
00:05:32,187 --> 00:05:34,913
Don't you dare twist my words around to make yourself feel

80
00:05:34,917 --> 00:05:37,482
like you are not a backstabbing two-faced bitch, Peyton,

81
00:05:37,488 --> 00:05:40,400
because you are... and you know it.

82
00:05:55,866 --> 00:05:57,080
Hey, pretty girl.

83
00:05:57,085 --> 00:05:58,142
Hey.

84
00:05:58,577 --> 00:06:00,791
-  What's going on?
- Nothing.

85
00:06:01,195 --> 00:06:04,983
Come on, nobody loves a wedding more than Brooke Davis. What's up?

86
00:06:04,995 --> 00:06:07,700
I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't talk to Peyton today.

87
00:06:07,946 --> 00:06:09,682
You're kidding, right?

88
00:06:10,676 --> 00:06:13,293
This is a wedding. We're all in the same wedding party.

89
00:06:13,298 --> 00:06:14,723
We're all friends here, Brooke.

90
00:06:14,737 --> 00:06:16,533
You know, could you do me a favor just once

91
00:06:16,535 --> 00:06:18,870
and put me above your precious Peyton

92
00:06:18,877 --> 00:06:21,130
and do something that I ask you to do? Thanks.

93
00:06:21,135 --> 00:06:22,763
Whoa. What happened?

94
00:06:24,498 --> 00:06:26,070
We had a fight...

95
00:06:27,725 --> 00:06:32,250
and I'm stressed out about my speech and Haley's dress, and I'm late.

96
00:06:32,256 --> 00:06:36,961
I'm late to get ready, and... I'm sorry.

97
00:06:38,726 --> 00:06:40,072
Come here.

98
00:06:44,308 --> 00:06:45,862
It's okay.

99
00:06:48,378 --> 00:06:49,951
You look nice.

100
00:06:55,015 --> 00:06:56,511
Weddings.

101
00:07:23,277 --> 00:07:24,491
Rachel?

102
00:07:29,456 --> 00:07:31,811
You look almost as hot as me.

103
00:07:31,817 --> 00:07:34,620
Listen to me. You got to stop calling me.

104
00:07:34,638 --> 00:07:36,651
I told you we couldn't see each other anymore.

105
00:07:36,656 --> 00:07:40,401
Before you left that morning, I think I made myself perfectly clear.

106
00:07:40,408 --> 00:07:44,292
Yeah, but the night before that, you weren't so clear.

107
00:07:44,385 --> 00:07:48,510
In fact, if I remember right, I think you weren't so clear three times.

108
00:07:48,516 --> 00:07:50,001
You're 17.

109
00:07:50,007 --> 00:07:52,362
Yeah. I was 17 that night, too...

110
00:07:52,366 --> 00:07:53,962
and all the other nights.

111
00:07:53,966 --> 00:07:55,562
Okay. Listen to me.

112
00:07:55,577 --> 00:07:58,461
I'm sorry, okay? I made a mistake,

113
00:07:58,468 --> 00:08:00,963
but this is Nathan and Haley's day.

114
00:08:00,975 --> 00:08:03,982
Now, I promise you we'll talk about this later,

115
00:08:03,987 --> 00:08:06,662
but do not make this ugly for them.

116
00:08:08,825 --> 00:08:10,572
I wouldn't think of it.

117
00:08:21,015 --> 00:08:22,292
Need a hand?

118
00:08:23,987 --> 00:08:25,970
No, I'm okay. Thanks.

119
00:08:26,077 --> 00:08:29,292
It's just a tie, Lucas. Come on, let me see.

120
00:08:35,055 --> 00:08:37,193
So, how is life without basketball?

121
00:08:38,786 --> 00:08:40,861
It's better than life without Keith.

122
00:08:47,006 --> 00:08:48,981
Okay. Let's see.

123
00:08:55,235 --> 00:09:00,280
Dan thinks it was Keith -- the fire --

124
00:09:00,285 --> 00:09:02,523
but  I just found out this morning.

125
00:09:02,527 --> 00:09:04,350
I'm sorry, Karen.

126
00:09:04,407 --> 00:09:07,473
It's  not fair to Keith's memory. It's not fair to you.

127
00:09:09,898 --> 00:09:12,500
Yes, it's not fair to Keith,

128
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:17,480
but Dan's need for revenge was buried with his brother.

129
00:09:17,998 --> 00:09:21,353
He's not gonna be coming after you or anybody else.

130
00:09:21,357 --> 00:09:26,670
Maybe so, but in a way that makes me feel weaker than ever.

131
00:09:41,257 --> 00:09:42,853
Nathan!

132
00:09:43,247 --> 00:09:44,360
Nathan?

133
00:09:45,235 --> 00:09:46,743
- You okay?
- Yeah.

134
00:09:46,745 --> 00:09:48,792
- Have you checked on Haley?
- Yeah, she's fine.

135
00:09:48,795 --> 00:09:50,842
She should be here by now. Can you call her?

136
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:53,261
- Nate --
- Please. Just do it.

137
00:09:53,277 --> 00:09:55,372
Okay. All right, all right.

138
00:10:01,257 --> 00:10:03,770
Hey, Haley, you all right?

139
00:10:03,937 --> 00:10:05,691
Something's wrong, man.

140
00:10:06,557 --> 00:10:08,040
Hey, what's up?

141
00:10:10,936 --> 00:10:13,093
Hey, it's me. Is everything okay?

142
00:10:13,676 --> 00:10:16,813
Fine, soon-to-be-husband-again, why?

143
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:20,673
I just... I just wanted to hear your voice, that's all.

144
00:10:20,672 --> 00:10:21,976
Where are you?

145
00:10:23,077 --> 00:10:24,796
I'm right here.

146
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:53,592
Oh, I'm sorry, princess. I was looking for my friend Haley.

147
00:10:54,605 --> 00:10:57,312
Wow, did it really take all this stuff to make you look like this?

148
00:10:57,316 --> 00:10:59,692
No, everybody got ready in here,

149
00:10:59,695 --> 00:11:01,870
including Rachel and Brooke for some reason.

150
00:11:01,876 --> 00:11:03,021
Right.

151
00:11:04,647 --> 00:11:06,813
Wow. You...

152
00:11:07,278 --> 00:11:09,352
whew... really look beautiful.

153
00:11:09,356 --> 00:11:10,383
Thank you.

154
00:11:10,387 --> 00:11:12,071
So, your parents really aren't coming?

155
00:11:12,086 --> 00:11:15,621
No, they -- I invited them, and they said,

156
00:11:15,628 --> 00:11:19,200
"sorry, honey, we've been to your wedding once before, and it was a little boring."

157
00:11:19,716 --> 00:11:23,060
Anyway, I'll just give myself away. It's fine.

158
00:11:23,627 --> 00:11:25,411
Or I could do it...

159
00:11:27,818 --> 00:11:29,562
...if you'll have me.

160
00:11:31,308 --> 00:11:32,650
Really?

161
00:11:33,196 --> 00:11:35,523
Luke, that would be perfect.

162
00:11:35,525 --> 00:11:37,063
Okay.

163
00:11:37,215 --> 00:11:38,691
Thank you.

164
00:11:39,056 --> 00:11:41,081
But you know what? I got to be honest with you.

165
00:11:42,006 --> 00:11:45,841
I could never officially give you away, you know that?

166
00:11:46,076 --> 00:11:48,472
I could never give away my best friend.

167
00:11:51,358 --> 00:11:52,783
Congrats.

168
00:11:58,418 --> 00:11:59,962
Hey, Rachel.

169
00:12:00,096 --> 00:12:02,771
You look almost as hot as me.

170
00:12:03,355 --> 00:12:05,290
Sounds like something I would say.

171
00:12:06,285 --> 00:12:07,813
- Hey, Peyton.
- Hi.

172
00:12:07,816 --> 00:12:12,050
How about we, uh, go find you a good seat... friend?

173
00:12:18,018 --> 00:12:19,211
Hey, you.

174
00:12:20,266 --> 00:12:22,940
So, I've been informed to avoid you like the plague.

175
00:12:22,948 --> 00:12:25,153
- What's up?
- Nothing, just --

176
00:12:25,236 --> 00:12:28,600
look, if Brooke doesn't want you to talk to me, just do it. I'll be fine.

177
00:12:30,657 --> 00:12:31,923
Hey, Peyton.

178
00:12:34,055 --> 00:12:35,383
You look nice.

179
00:13:09,798 --> 00:13:11,801
Feeling sentimental, Deb?

180
00:13:11,815 --> 00:13:14,221
Feeling nauseous, actually.

181
00:13:19,655 --> 00:13:21,051
You had your chance.

182
00:13:22,697 --> 00:13:25,073
Want to make it a dual ceremony, Coop?

183
00:13:33,307 --> 00:13:36,090
Now I know how this dress looks on a witch.

184
00:13:36,258 --> 00:13:38,113
Go Brooke yourself.

185
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:17,703
Friends and loved ones,

186
00:14:17,777 --> 00:14:21,620
we are gathered here today to witness the renewal of a commitment,

187
00:14:21,627 --> 00:14:24,433
a commitment between Nathan and Haley

188
00:14:24,437 --> 00:14:29,082
to love one another unconditionally and endlessly.

189
00:14:29,638 --> 00:14:31,370
Nathan and Haley,

190
00:14:31,776 --> 00:14:34,992
there are many things I could say to the two of you today,

191
00:14:34,998 --> 00:14:39,173
but instead I choose to listen to the words you have for each other.

192
00:14:39,478 --> 00:14:40,732
Haley?

193
00:14:42,045 --> 00:14:45,172
Nathan, it's been said that there's one word

194
00:14:45,176 --> 00:14:48,751
that will free us from the weight and the pain of life,

195
00:14:48,756 --> 00:14:50,850
and that word is "love,"

196
00:14:51,616 --> 00:14:53,320
and I believe that.

197
00:14:53,575 --> 00:14:57,150
That doesn't mean that it hasn't been hard or that it won't be.

198
00:14:57,216 --> 00:15:02,613
It just means that I found a stillness

199
00:15:02,997 --> 00:15:06,201
and a bravery in myself with you.

200
00:15:07,095 --> 00:15:08,843
You make me brave,

201
00:15:09,748 --> 00:15:13,933
and I will love you until the end of time.

202
00:15:14,998 --> 00:15:16,901
This I vow today.

203
00:15:18,815 --> 00:15:19,971
Nathan?

204
00:15:22,426 --> 00:15:26,231
Last year, we stood on a beach, and I told you how much I loved you

205
00:15:26,237 --> 00:15:29,791
and how I would always, always protect you.

206
00:15:30,555 --> 00:15:33,302
That day nobody believed that this would work,

207
00:15:33,958 --> 00:15:39,280
but I don't think anybody understood the love that I had for you.

208
00:15:39,877 --> 00:15:43,440
Because if they did, they would've never doubted us.

209
00:15:44,408 --> 00:15:48,761
So I wanted to marry you all over again in front of most of our world

210
00:15:49,846 --> 00:15:53,352
because today, when I look into your eyes,

211
00:15:53,988 --> 00:15:56,422
my love for you only grows.

212
00:15:56,905 --> 00:15:59,052
It's even stronger now,

213
00:16:00,155 --> 00:16:02,352
and our love will never waver.

214
00:16:03,165 --> 00:16:06,342
And this I vow to you today

215
00:16:06,395 --> 00:16:09,721
and always and forever.

216
00:16:12,897 --> 00:16:18,523
Haley, on this day, do you reconfirm and rededicate yourself

217
00:16:18,527 --> 00:16:21,171
to the vows you promised to uphold?

218
00:16:21,525 --> 00:16:24,390
Oh. Thank you.

219
00:16:24,406 --> 00:16:25,941
I do.

220
00:16:29,197 --> 00:16:33,792
Nathan, on this day, do you rededicate and reconfirm

221
00:16:33,797 --> 00:16:37,672
your commitment to the vows you promised to uphold?

222
00:16:37,677 --> 00:16:39,110
I do.

223
00:16:39,996 --> 00:16:44,102
And, uh, actually, I have a new ring.

224
00:16:55,778 --> 00:16:57,231
Thank you.

225
00:16:57,467 --> 00:16:59,871
And now, before the eyes of God,

226
00:16:59,877 --> 00:17:03,573
I once again pronounce you husband and wife.

227
00:17:03,667 --> 00:17:05,203
You may kiss your bride.

228
00:17:05,206 --> 00:17:07,302
- I love you, Haley.
- I love you, too.

229
00:17:37,696 --> 00:17:42,231
You know... one day we'll walk down the aisle again, Deb. You'll see.

230
00:17:42,235 --> 00:17:44,432
Open your eyes, Dan.

231
00:17:44,838 --> 00:17:47,950
I don't love you. I'm not coming back to you.

232
00:17:48,616 --> 00:17:50,693
And Keith didn't try to kill you.

233
00:17:51,267 --> 00:17:52,610
I did.

234
00:18:10,717 --> 00:18:12,402
Danny?

235
00:18:16,817 --> 00:18:19,181
How's your life, little brother?

236
00:18:37,308 --> 00:18:39,563
I'm Cooper, by the way. You're Michelle Featherstone, right?

237
00:18:39,567 --> 00:18:40,151
Yes.

238
00:18:40,155 --> 00:18:41,781
That song you played was perfect.

239
00:18:41,786 --> 00:18:43,391
In fact, I think all your stuff is really great.

240
00:18:43,397 --> 00:18:45,003
Thank you, thank you.

241
00:18:45,016 --> 00:18:48,412
I think, um, all of your stuff is pretty great, too.

242
00:18:48,427 --> 00:18:49,921
Well, thank you.

243
00:18:51,596 --> 00:18:52,883
Hey, Rach.

244
00:19:09,398 --> 00:19:11,082
Are you gonna talk to me?

245
00:19:11,535 --> 00:19:12,843
Please?

246
00:19:15,646 --> 00:19:16,651
Fine.

247
00:19:16,925 --> 00:19:18,871
So, this is how it ends --

248
00:19:19,105 --> 00:19:23,451
a 10-year friendship that survived two dead moms,

249
00:19:23,488 --> 00:19:25,482
three absentee parents,

250
00:19:26,297 --> 00:19:29,331
shoplifting, jail time,

251
00:19:30,707 --> 00:19:33,623
and we can't survive one boy?

252
00:19:33,728 --> 00:19:36,003
Not one boy, Peyton --

253
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:37,552
my boy.

254
00:19:37,558 --> 00:19:40,872
And he still is your boy. I told you that.

255
00:19:43,226 --> 00:19:44,612
Do you love him?

256
00:19:46,268 --> 00:19:48,432
You are something else.

257
00:19:48,728 --> 00:19:52,093
How dare you be so selfish to ask me that about my boyfriend.

258
00:19:52,098 --> 00:19:53,463
How dare I?

259
00:19:53,475 --> 00:19:55,321
Okay, you know what, Brooke?

260
00:19:55,328 --> 00:19:58,733
I didn't want it this way, okay? I tried tears.

261
00:19:58,746 --> 00:20:02,653
I tried apologizing to you. I cried, and you know what you did?

262
00:20:02,657 --> 00:20:05,440
You slapped me, and you blew me off.

263
00:20:05,447 --> 00:20:08,140
You're gonna be lucky if next time I don't use my fist.

264
00:20:08,687 --> 00:20:11,691
I can't believe you're supposed to be the maid of honor.

265
00:20:12,608 --> 00:20:17,910
And by the way, none of those words were, "yes, Peyton, I love him."

266
00:20:22,976 --> 00:20:25,393
Ladies and gentlemen, please stand and join me

267
00:20:25,395 --> 00:20:29,523
in welcoming Nathan and Haley, husband and wife again.

268
00:20:37,727 --> 00:20:40,743
And now the song they picked for their first dance.

269
00:20:42,466 --> 00:20:44,313
What song did you pick anyway?

270
00:20:46,287 --> 00:20:48,771
Oh, I was hoping it would be this one.

271
00:20:48,775 --> 00:20:50,243
I had a little help.

272
00:22:08,796 --> 00:22:10,573
So you gonna tell me what this is about?

273
00:22:10,588 --> 00:22:12,373
Maybe you should tell me about it.

274
00:22:12,388 --> 00:22:14,413
What's that supposed to mean?

275
00:22:15,395 --> 00:22:18,303
Peyton told me some things about the two of you.

276
00:22:19,487 --> 00:22:24,833
Look,  Brooke, I know that you're worried about my past with Peyton,

277
00:22:24,835 --> 00:22:27,763
but you have to understand the circumstances this time, you know?

278
00:22:27,895 --> 00:22:32,331
God, she was bleeding, and she thought she was gonna die.

279
00:22:32,346 --> 00:22:35,312
I mean, the kiss, it meant nothing.

280
00:22:37,127 --> 00:22:38,610
What kiss?

281
00:22:39,828 --> 00:22:42,222
Did you kiss her again?

282
00:23:12,887 --> 00:23:17,442
Look, Brooke, I need you to listen to me, okay?

283
00:23:17,448 --> 00:23:19,293
I understand that you didn't know about the kiss,

284
00:23:19,295 --> 00:23:22,591
and I'm sorry for springing it on you, but I meant what I said.

285
00:23:22,598 --> 00:23:24,481
It didn't mean anything.

286
00:23:24,577 --> 00:23:27,153
A kiss always means something.

287
00:23:27,345 --> 00:23:31,290
Okay, maybe you're right, but it wasn't a romantic moment,

288
00:23:31,295 --> 00:23:33,750
- and you would know that if --
- If what -- I was there?

289
00:23:33,755 --> 00:23:37,432
As you so sweetly pointed out at the party, the party that I threw for you,

290
00:23:37,436 --> 00:23:39,392
I wasn't there, was I?

291
00:23:45,478 --> 00:23:49,813
Is it impossible for you to forgive me?

292
00:23:50,575 --> 00:23:52,061
I forgave you.

293
00:23:52,067 --> 00:23:53,901
For what?

294
00:23:54,848 --> 00:23:57,070
For sleeping with Chris Keller.

295
00:24:00,987 --> 00:24:03,862
And you know what, Lucas? I loved you for that.

296
00:24:04,256 --> 00:24:08,972
You had such grace in that moment

297
00:24:08,977 --> 00:24:12,641
that I fell in love with you all over again.

298
00:24:13,846 --> 00:24:16,971
I  can't believe that you would use it now as a bargaining chip.

299
00:24:16,975 --> 00:24:19,732
No, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not. I just...

300
00:24:19,885 --> 00:24:24,602
I need you to trust me and believe me when I tell you that my heart is with you.

301
00:24:25,636 --> 00:24:28,871
But part of me feels like ever since we got back together,

302
00:24:28,875 --> 00:24:32,370
you've  just been waiting -- waiting to push me away.

303
00:24:32,378 --> 00:24:33,670
Oh, great.

304
00:24:33,678 --> 00:24:35,782
You kiss Peyton -- again --

305
00:24:35,787 --> 00:24:38,052
and I'm pushing you away!

306
00:24:40,108 --> 00:24:43,831
God! Why did I make everybody identical purses as wedding gifts?!

307
00:24:46,365 --> 00:24:48,230
I love you, Brooke.

308
00:24:50,925 --> 00:24:52,730
I don't know how else to say it.

309
00:24:52,736 --> 00:24:54,882
How about how you show it?

310
00:24:55,515 --> 00:24:57,550
I am not pushing you away, Lucas.

311
00:24:57,555 --> 00:25:02,722
I am holding on for dear life, but I need you to need me back.

312
00:25:02,728 --> 00:25:05,540
Okay, why wouldn't you tell me about the kiss?

313
00:25:05,548 --> 00:25:08,393
And why didn't you call me while you were away?

314
00:25:08,395 --> 00:25:12,491
And why won't you ever just let me all the way in?

315
00:25:19,956 --> 00:25:22,860
We have to go and give our toasts now...

316
00:25:24,218 --> 00:25:26,003
...about love.

317
00:25:28,676 --> 00:25:30,740
Please don't be mad, Brooke.

318
00:25:32,345 --> 00:25:34,491
I'm not mad, Lucas.

319
00:25:35,078 --> 00:25:36,512
I'm not mad.

320
00:25:49,558 --> 00:25:53,543
The last time I gave a speech about Nathan and Haley was...

321
00:25:53,546 --> 00:25:55,512
well, at the first reception.

322
00:25:56,307 --> 00:26:00,291
I remember saying, "prepare to be surprised."

323
00:26:00,676 --> 00:26:03,963
Well, I have to say even I was surprised

324
00:26:04,206 --> 00:26:10,600
because, you see, they do something that's very rare to see in someone our age.

325
00:26:10,607 --> 00:26:14,433
Actually, it's very rare to see in anybody.

326
00:26:15,135 --> 00:26:17,362
They give their hearts to each other...

327
00:26:17,367 --> 00:26:19,311
unconditionally.

328
00:26:21,747 --> 00:26:24,053
And that's what true love really is.

329
00:26:24,636 --> 00:26:29,533
It's not this fairy-tale life that never knows pain,

330
00:26:29,537 --> 00:26:33,352
but it's two souls facing it together

331
00:26:34,046 --> 00:26:37,622
and diminishing it with unconditional love.

332
00:26:38,836 --> 00:26:42,023
To Nathan and Haley Scott.

333
00:26:56,277 --> 00:26:59,183
I'm not the most eloquent speaker,

334
00:26:59,185 --> 00:27:05,043
so I thought I would borrow a few words from Shakespeare.

335
00:27:06,075 --> 00:27:11,960
"Love is not love which alters when it alteration finds."

336
00:27:12,178 --> 00:27:16,330
When life gets hard, when things change,

337
00:27:16,336 --> 00:27:18,652
true love remains the same.

338
00:27:20,156 --> 00:27:24,940
I look at Nathan and Haley, and somehow I feel safer.

339
00:27:25,376 --> 00:27:28,371
I don't know if I can explain that, but

340
00:27:28,535 --> 00:27:30,453
they give me hope.

341
00:27:31,028 --> 00:27:34,851
And I'm afraid to say it out loud because maybe if life finds out,

342
00:27:34,855 --> 00:27:39,720
it'll try to beat it out of them, and that would be a shame

343
00:27:39,917 --> 00:27:43,321
because we all can use a little hope sometimes, you know?

344
00:27:43,876 --> 00:27:48,191
That feeling that everything is gonna be okay

345
00:27:48,747 --> 00:27:52,483
and that there's going to be someone there to help make sure of that.

346
00:27:53,158 --> 00:27:56,632
So, here's to Nathan and Haley,

347
00:27:56,638 --> 00:28:01,771
here's to hope, and here's to a love that will not alter.

348
00:28:19,956 --> 00:28:23,703
I never apologized for the way I treated you and Lucas...

349
00:28:25,418 --> 00:28:27,760
...or for the way I treated Keith.

350
00:28:30,216 --> 00:28:32,373
I suppose it's too late.

351
00:28:36,568 --> 00:28:38,053
I'm pregnant.

352
00:28:49,956 --> 00:28:52,592
I'm gonna be there for you this time, Karen.

353
00:28:54,307 --> 00:28:56,003
It's gonna be okay.

354
00:28:58,168 --> 00:29:01,090
Hi. Excuse me. I'd like your attention for a second.

355
00:29:01,108 --> 00:29:03,183
I'd like to propose a toast

356
00:29:03,355 --> 00:29:07,680
to my knucklehead of a nephew and his beautiful bride.

357
00:29:07,685 --> 00:29:08,680
Ah, here we go.

358
00:29:08,686 --> 00:29:13,163
As most of you know, Nathan and Haley's relationship was --

359
00:29:13,466 --> 00:29:15,323
was unexpected,

360
00:29:15,327 --> 00:29:19,703
mostly because Haley is classy and attractive

361
00:29:19,707 --> 00:29:22,760
and Nathan is... not.

362
00:29:23,468 --> 00:29:24,460
Ouch!

363
00:29:24,935 --> 00:29:29,853
But here's to Nathan and Haley for proving to us that love is real

364
00:29:29,855 --> 00:29:33,721
and genuine and still attainable for the rest of us. Cheers, you two.

365
00:29:38,505 --> 00:29:40,410
Thanks, coop, I guess.

366
00:29:45,456 --> 00:29:49,760
Well, well. I would like to make a toast

367
00:29:50,618 --> 00:29:52,770
to Cooper's toast...

368
00:29:53,487 --> 00:29:55,432
...about love.

369
00:29:55,928 --> 00:29:57,630
But wait a minute.

370
00:29:57,938 --> 00:30:02,242
What could Nathan and Haley possibly know about love?

371
00:30:02,248 --> 00:30:04,452
I mean, they're only 17, right?

372
00:30:04,457 --> 00:30:05,863
Right, Cooper?

373
00:30:05,875 --> 00:30:09,713
You see, Cooper seems to think a 17-year-old

374
00:30:09,715 --> 00:30:13,641
couldn't possibly know anything about love.

375
00:30:14,326 --> 00:30:18,303
Of course, that didn't stop him from having sex with me, okay?

376
00:30:18,306 --> 00:30:19,492
Rachel...

377
00:30:20,425 --> 00:30:23,972
Yeah. To sex with Cooper!

378
00:30:28,016 --> 00:30:29,460
Is she serious?

379
00:30:29,656 --> 00:30:32,060
I'm so sorry. Excuse me.

380
00:30:40,897 --> 00:30:42,952
Hey, Rachel, come on.

381
00:30:45,048 --> 00:30:46,392
Rachel!

382
00:30:46,695 --> 00:30:48,731
No, no, no! Hey, hey -- bad idea.

383
00:30:49,575 --> 00:30:50,931
Hey, hey, hey!

384
00:30:52,337 --> 00:30:55,403
Rachel, stop the car. Damn it, Rachel, stop the car!

385
00:31:07,626 --> 00:31:09,330
Are you trying to kill me?!

386
00:31:09,337 --> 00:31:10,741
What is your problem?

387
00:31:10,747 --> 00:31:13,813
First you ruin the reception, you steal a limousine, and you drive drunk?

388
00:31:13,817 --> 00:31:15,023
Are you out of your mind?!

389
00:31:15,027 --> 00:31:17,433
I must be to fall in love with you!

390
00:31:22,146 --> 00:31:25,573
Look, I'm sorry, Rachel, okay? I made a mistake when we slept together,

391
00:31:25,577 --> 00:31:28,060
and it wasn't just because you're 17.

392
00:31:28,365 --> 00:31:32,503
Hell, even when I thought you were older, I wasn't looking to get serious.

393
00:31:32,506 --> 00:31:34,551
I'm sorry. I mean, that sounds harsh,

394
00:31:34,557 --> 00:31:38,191
but you even said, "we're just having fun, Coop," remember?

395
00:31:38,647 --> 00:31:40,013
I lied.

396
00:31:44,708 --> 00:31:46,630
I'm so stupid.

397
00:31:47,048 --> 00:31:50,752
Hey, don't -- don't do that.

398
00:31:53,546 --> 00:31:55,343
I thought you liked me.

399
00:31:55,535 --> 00:31:58,340
I did, Rachel. I liked you.

400
00:31:58,376 --> 00:31:59,663
Right.

401
00:32:01,387 --> 00:32:02,661
"Liked."

402
00:32:06,688 --> 00:32:08,933
Look, let me take you home, okay?

403
00:32:10,567 --> 00:32:13,643
No. I left all my stuff at the reception -- my purse, my keys--

404
00:32:13,656 --> 00:32:14,782
That's fine. That's great. You know what?

405
00:32:14,785 --> 00:32:17,100
Then we'll take the limousine back to the reception,

406
00:32:17,165 --> 00:32:19,733
and we'll pretend like none of this ever happened...

407
00:32:19,888 --> 00:32:21,520
all right?

408
00:32:25,747 --> 00:32:27,101
Let's go.

409
00:32:42,178 --> 00:32:45,531
So, there was a slight mix-up.

410
00:32:46,167 --> 00:32:48,393
- Sweet! I'm driving.
- No way.

411
00:32:49,007 --> 00:32:50,563
Hey, we'll leave the car at the airport.

412
00:32:50,565 --> 00:32:51,763
All right.

413
00:32:51,936 --> 00:32:54,161
We're going to London for a few days.

414
00:32:54,168 --> 00:32:56,300
Why? Doesn't it always rain there?

415
00:32:56,465 --> 00:32:57,650
Oh, yeah.

416
00:32:58,158 --> 00:32:59,743
- You in?
- Yeah.

417
00:33:00,416 --> 00:33:02,353
Thank you, guys, for coming!

418
00:33:02,358 --> 00:33:04,190
We love you!

419
00:33:26,956 --> 00:33:28,401
Hey, buddy.

420
00:33:30,035 --> 00:33:33,503
It looks like Rachel took the limo with Cooper.

421
00:33:34,598 --> 00:33:36,162
I'm sorry.

422
00:33:36,266 --> 00:33:37,601
Yeah.

423
00:33:38,018 --> 00:33:39,472
Me too.

424
00:33:50,378 --> 00:33:53,673
So I guess we never finished that conversation.

425
00:33:56,348 --> 00:33:58,070
Dance with me.

426
00:34:18,058 --> 00:34:20,732
Did you miss me while you were away?

427
00:34:20,938 --> 00:34:22,571
Every day.

428
00:34:23,237 --> 00:34:27,931
I was just angry and upset about Keith,

429
00:34:27,935 --> 00:34:32,162
and I just needed to be alone, but that doesn't mean that I didn't miss you, Brooke...

430
00:34:33,685 --> 00:34:35,270
because I did.

431
00:34:36,977 --> 00:34:39,223
I needed to hear your voice.

432
00:34:40,976 --> 00:34:44,030
There's just so much stuff going on with me.

433
00:34:44,836 --> 00:34:46,843
What kind of stuff?

434
00:35:09,067 --> 00:35:11,143
I just got that feeling,

435
00:35:12,005 --> 00:35:15,153
that stillness I used to feel before dawn,

436
00:35:15,876 --> 00:35:18,612
feeling like the world could be perfect.

437
00:35:19,756 --> 00:35:21,593
Yeah, I feel it, too.

438
00:35:29,745 --> 00:35:31,843
Don't say I never gave you anything.

439
00:35:38,718 --> 00:35:40,712
Then there were two.

440
00:35:42,198 --> 00:35:45,401
I'm sorry about today -- all the drama.

441
00:35:46,077 --> 00:35:47,543
Peyton...

442
00:35:48,135 --> 00:35:51,311
I accidentally told Brooke about the library,

443
00:35:51,367 --> 00:35:53,010
the kiss.

444
00:35:54,136 --> 00:35:56,460
Um, Luke?

445
00:35:57,018 --> 00:35:59,950
Are you going home with Brooke or with me?

446
00:35:59,957 --> 00:36:01,811
Uh, with you.

447
00:36:02,218 --> 00:36:03,852
Brooke left.

448
00:36:10,027 --> 00:36:11,313
I'm sorry.

449
00:36:27,557 --> 00:36:29,300
You and Brooke okay?

450
00:36:29,857 --> 00:36:33,173
Yeah, she's just going through some stuff.

451
00:36:33,326 --> 00:36:36,010
Well, could you grab my wrap and my purse?

452
00:36:36,015 --> 00:36:37,881
Yeah, sure. I'll drive.

453
00:36:53,006 --> 00:36:56,612
Hey, ma, are you...

454
00:36:57,665 --> 00:36:59,172
pregnant?

455
00:37:02,547 --> 00:37:04,130
Yes, I am.

456
00:37:09,867 --> 00:37:11,883
But that's not my purse.

457
00:37:15,126 --> 00:37:17,803
You know, maybe Brooke took the wrong --

458
00:37:23,306 --> 00:37:24,642
Brooke.

459
00:37:29,916 --> 00:37:33,540
Brooke, don't go -- please.

460
00:37:33,976 --> 00:37:36,221
I don't want to, but I have to.

461
00:37:36,928 --> 00:37:41,540
Okay. All right. Look, just stop, all right? What do I have to do to fix this?

462
00:37:42,128 --> 00:37:44,302
Brooke, I'll do anything.

463
00:37:44,315 --> 00:37:46,522
Just -- I don't want you to go.

464
00:37:49,057 --> 00:37:52,332
You asked me earlier today if I love Lucas,

465
00:37:52,705 --> 00:37:54,672
and I have your answer.

466
00:37:56,285 --> 00:37:58,750
But you don't deserve to hear it.

467
00:37:59,346 --> 00:38:00,371
Brooke --

468
00:38:00,377 --> 00:38:03,653
No. I want you to understand something.

469
00:38:04,498 --> 00:38:07,932
As far as I am concerned, this friendship is over.

470
00:38:09,197 --> 00:38:14,571
And if we never speak again for the rest of our lives, that'll be fine.

471
00:38:24,965 --> 00:38:28,060
I gave you a second chance, Peyton,

472
00:38:29,396 --> 00:38:31,343
and you blew it.

473
00:38:46,038 --> 00:38:48,811
Is there anything I could say to keep you, Cooper?

474
00:38:51,455 --> 00:38:53,860
No, I'm sorry, Rachel. There's not.

475
00:38:59,395 --> 00:39:00,812
That's too bad...

476
00:39:03,465 --> 00:39:05,950
because there's something I have to tell you.

477
00:39:19,096 --> 00:39:22,721
Oh! I left my purse.

478
00:39:22,727 --> 00:39:26,133
It's got everything in it -- the plane tickets, everything. We have to go back.

479
00:39:26,138 --> 00:39:28,763
No, no, no, it's okay. I'll just have Lucas meet us.

480
00:39:30,558 --> 00:39:32,002
Hey, Luke?

481
00:39:32,006 --> 00:39:35,150
Hey, man, Haley left her purse and a bunch of stuff at the reception.

482
00:39:35,156 --> 00:39:36,882
Could you bring that to us?

483
00:39:37,346 --> 00:39:41,063
Oh. Oh, okay. Well, we're coming up on the Molina Bridge right now,

484
00:39:41,066 --> 00:39:43,980
so I guess we'll just pull over and wait for you.

485
00:39:43,988 --> 00:39:45,943
All right. Thanks, man. Bye.

486
00:39:46,238 --> 00:39:47,331
Done.

487
00:39:47,335 --> 00:39:49,270
He already had the purse in his car.

488
00:39:50,987 --> 00:39:52,452
You're good in a crisis.

489
00:39:52,458 --> 00:39:54,212
Oh, I don't know about that.

490
00:39:54,987 --> 00:39:56,582
No, you are.

491
00:39:57,707 --> 00:39:59,471
It's a good thing, too,

492
00:39:59,917 --> 00:40:04,290
especially since I have something I have to tell you.

493
00:40:07,755 --> 00:40:09,731
I don't believe you.

494
00:40:11,876 --> 00:40:13,212
Pull over.

495
00:40:13,218 --> 00:40:16,641
Hell no. I'm not letting you out until we talk about this.

496
00:40:16,647 --> 00:40:18,892
- I said pull over!
- No!

497
00:40:18,897 --> 00:40:21,142
I said pull over!

498
00:40:22,747 --> 00:40:24,533
What are you doing?!

499
00:40:30,927 --> 00:40:32,280
Look out!

500
00:41:15,238 --> 00:41:17,850
That was Cooper. Cooper!

501
00:41:17,858 --> 00:41:19,212
Cooper!

502
00:41:19,338 --> 00:41:22,532
- Haley, call 911.
- Nathan, don't!

503
00:41:24,667 --> 00:41:26,162
I love you.

504
00:41:27,347 --> 00:41:28,740
Nathan!

505
00:41:32,417 --> 00:41:33,862
Nathan!

506
00:41:34,217 --> 00:41:35,911
Nathan!

507
00:42:26,706 --> 00:42:29,573
Nathan! Cooper!

508
00:42:30,068 --> 00:42:32,573
Anybody, please help!
