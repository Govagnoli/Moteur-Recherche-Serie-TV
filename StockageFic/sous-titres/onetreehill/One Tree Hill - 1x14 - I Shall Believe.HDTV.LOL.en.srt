1
00:01:48,654 --> 00:01:50,449
We are losing him. We got a code blue.

2
00:01:53,579 --> 00:01:54,827
Charge the paddles to 200.

3
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:55,938
Charging

4
00:02:02,629 --> 00:02:03,421
Clear.

5
00:02:09,166 --> 00:02:11,733
Charge the paddles to 300. Clear.

6
00:02:17,841 --> 00:02:19,050
He’s a go.

7
00:02:19,905 --> 00:02:21,238
Okay, lets go in.

8
00:02:33,351 --> 00:02:34,544
How long will this take?

9
00:02:34,656 --> 00:02:36,870
We’re just about done here now.

10
00:02:37,488 --> 00:02:40,016
I don’t mean me, I’m talking about my nephew, Lucas.

11
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:41,570
How long will he be in surgery?

12
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:44,060
Well, it depends on how serious his injuries are.

13
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:57,000
I’m sorry, what did you just say?

14
00:02:57,564 --> 00:02:58,450
About what?

15
00:02:58,608 --> 00:03:00,033
About the way that we started.

16
00:03:01,189 --> 00:03:04,062
Nothing. Just when I first came to you for tutoring,

17
00:03:04,477 --> 00:03:08,209
I figured the easiest way to mess with Lucas was to hook up with you, but…

18
00:03:08,311 --> 00:03:10,553
So everything between us has been a lie?

19
00:03:10,795 --> 00:03:12,048
No, that’s not.

20
00:03:12,141 --> 00:03:14,761
I cannot believe this, Lucas was right about you all along.

21
00:03:15,577 --> 00:03:20,466
Haley, pick up. There’s been an accident. Lucas is hurt pretty bad.

22
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:21,895
Haley?

23
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:23,185
Keith, hey.

24
00:03:25,279 --> 00:03:26,794
He’s going to make it, right?

25
00:03:28,817 --> 00:03:30,071
Okay, thanks.

26
00:03:30,603 --> 00:03:33,076
- Come on, I’ll take you to the hospital.
- I can’t talk to you right now, Nathan.

27
00:03:33,138 --> 00:03:35,191
Haley, look I’m sorry I didn’t mean it like that.

28
00:03:35,253 --> 00:03:36,215
Just go.

29
00:03:37,071 --> 00:03:37,915
Just go.

30
00:03:44,321 --> 00:03:47,418
Hey, you know you can tell me anything, what is it?

31
00:03:47,525 --> 00:03:48,667
It’s just…

32
00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:52,031
There’s something you should know.

33
00:03:55,896 --> 00:03:58,226
Hello? Haley, what’s wrong?

34
00:04:04,652 --> 00:04:05,732
Peyton, what?

35
00:04:10,729 --> 00:04:11,564
Lucas.

36
00:04:12,752 --> 00:04:13,868
There’s been an accident.

37
00:04:15,137 --> 00:04:16,162
You should go to him.

38
00:04:18,911 --> 00:04:19,628
Keith.

39
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:23,198
I’m so glad you’re okay.

40
00:04:23,714 --> 00:04:26,233
- Where is he? 
- I’m so sorry. I didn’t see the other car.

41
00:04:26,279 --> 00:04:28,301
Where’s the operating room? I need someone to tell me what’s happening.

42
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:32,182
They asked us to wait here and they’re going to let us know when he’s in recovery.

43
00:04:32,283 --> 00:04:35,562
I couldn’t get a cab and then the only thing I had to pay with was Euros.

44
00:04:36,079 --> 00:04:37,922
He’s got to be alright, Keith.

45
00:04:38,546 --> 00:04:39,898
I wont’ lose him.

46
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:40,967
I know.

47
00:04:41,218 --> 00:04:41,946
I can’t.

48
00:04:43,027 --> 00:04:44,260
Excuse me, Doctor.

49
00:04:47,374 --> 00:04:49,309
Were you in the operating room with Lucas Scott?

50
00:04:49,462 --> 00:04:51,346
He was in a car accident. He’s my son.

51
00:04:51,546 --> 00:04:55,648
Dr. Hill is an excellent surgeon. The kid’s lucky his father got him here so fast.

52
00:04:55,781 --> 00:04:56,616
His uncle.

53
00:04:57,046 --> 00:05:00,092
No, his father. He may have saved your sons life.

54
00:05:02,385 --> 00:05:05,032
Um, Dan saw the accident.

55
00:05:05,197 --> 00:05:09,989
He pulled Lucas out of the car, and he drove us here.

56
00:05:10,142 --> 00:05:10,767
Dan?

57
00:05:11,433 --> 00:05:15,968
Yeah, he knew Lucas was in bad shape so he couldn’t wait.

58
00:05:16,276 --> 00:05:19,502
And Dan gave the surgeon permission to operate.

59
00:05:19,867 --> 00:05:20,945
How could he?

60
00:05:21,882 --> 00:05:23,465
He said he was Lucas’ father.

61
00:05:24,464 --> 00:05:26,947
Keith. Keith, is he okay?

62
00:05:27,053 --> 00:05:28,514
Oh honey, we don’t know yet.

63
00:05:28,651 --> 00:05:31,892
I was supposed to see him tonight. He was supposed to come over after the airport and…

64
00:05:32,471 --> 00:05:35,657
- Karen, this is Brooke.
- I’m Brooke, Lucas’ girlfriend. Hi.

65
00:05:35,841 --> 00:05:37,059
Who’s here for Lucas Scott?

66
00:05:38,195 --> 00:05:41,975
- I’m his mother. Is my son okay?
- He’s stable and in recovery.

67
00:05:42,543 --> 00:05:44,207
- Could you just, give us a second?
- Yeah.

68
00:05:44,646 --> 00:05:48,369
He needed a lot of work. His right lung collapsed and had to be repaired.

69
00:05:48,456 --> 00:05:51,861
I had to remove his spleen but there shouldn’t be any long term repercussions.

70
00:05:51,979 --> 00:05:53,259
So you’re saying he’s going to be fine?

71
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:55,732
He’ll need physical therapy to his shoulder.

72
00:05:55,819 --> 00:05:58,609
It separated in the crash but we were able to reset it.

73
00:05:58,952 --> 00:06:01,451
Other than that he has a concussion and some bruising.

74
00:06:01,877 --> 00:06:04,273
But there was a complication during surgery.

75
00:06:04,869 --> 00:06:05,684
What?

76
00:06:05,818 --> 00:06:09,515
Your son lost a lot of blood. Which caused his heart rate to drop.

77
00:06:09,751 --> 00:06:13,729
We lost him for a few seconds. But as I said he’s stable now.

78
00:06:13,841 --> 00:06:17,354
And all of his vitals look good. So we just have to wait for him to wake up.

79
00:06:17,768 --> 00:06:19,402
When will that be?

80
00:06:19,489 --> 00:06:22,751
Could be a couple of hours, could be a couple of days. That’s up to him.

81
00:06:25,005 --> 00:06:26,995
- Thank you.
- You’re welcome.

82
00:06:31,998 --> 00:06:33,451
I’m so sorry.

83
00:06:40,742 --> 00:06:41,474
Hey.

84
00:06:42,763 --> 00:06:43,921
I thought you’d be at the hospital.

85
00:06:44,427 --> 00:06:45,320
Why aren’t you there?

86
00:06:46,543 --> 00:06:51,734
I dropped Brooke off. It’s just kind of weird, she’s still with Lucas.

87
00:06:52,283 --> 00:06:53,875
She doesn’t know about you guys yet?

88
00:06:55,068 --> 00:06:56,476
We were going to tell her tonight.

89
00:06:59,323 --> 00:07:00,434
Don’t you want to see him?

90
00:07:01,105 --> 00:07:03,787
Yeah I do. I just can’t.

91
00:07:04,694 --> 00:07:05,364
Why not?

92
00:07:06,848 --> 00:07:09,465
If you don’t mind I’d really like to be alone right now.

93
00:07:10,879 --> 00:07:12,752
Yeah. Yeah okay.

94
00:07:13,633 --> 00:07:15,741
But I’m sure his mom would really like to see you.

95
00:07:15,842 --> 00:07:18,518
Peyton, I’ll go when I’m ready.

96
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:20,157
Sure.

97
00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:30,873
They took my son out of recovery. The nurse had me fill out these insurance forms.

98
00:07:31,052 --> 00:07:33,602
- What’s your sons name?
- Lucas Scott.

99
00:07:34,174 --> 00:07:37,308
- Scott, from the car accident? 
- Yeah.

100
00:07:38,164 --> 00:07:42,976
I  need to get a statement from that driver, Keith Scott.

101
00:07:43,898 --> 00:07:44,979
He’s a lucky guy.

102
00:07:45,881 --> 00:07:47,702
Yeah, a couple of stitches.

103
00:07:47,994 --> 00:07:50,396
Well, that’s not exactly what I meant.

104
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:54,901
See your husbands blood alcohol level was just shy the legal limit.

105
00:07:55,687 --> 00:07:58,382
Another hundredth of a point, he’d be in big trouble right now.

106
00:08:21,602 --> 00:08:23,681
I’ll never forgive myself if he’s not okay.

107
00:08:28,248 --> 00:08:29,866
Were you drinking tonight?

108
00:08:34,822 --> 00:08:36,149
- Karen…
- Were you?

109
00:08:40,555 --> 00:08:41,713
I wasn’t drunk.

110
00:08:43,393 --> 00:08:44,974
That’s  not what I asked you.

111
00:08:46,679 --> 00:08:48,800
Were you drinking before you drove Lucas?

112
00:08:51,908 --> 00:08:54,084
- Yes, but…
- I trusted you.

113
00:08:58,988 --> 00:09:00,637
I want you to leave.

114
00:09:26,243 --> 00:09:28,469
- Haley, what are you doing?
- Inventory.

115
00:09:29,437 --> 00:09:32,259
Lucas is lying in a hospital, why can’t you just go see him?

116
00:09:32,316 --> 00:09:34,301
Because he wouldn’t want to see me.

117
00:09:34,665 --> 00:09:36,400
What are you talking about? You guys are best friends.

118
00:09:36,493 --> 00:09:37,803
Not last night we weren’t.

119
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:41,920
- We got into a fight.
- About what?

120
00:09:42,852 --> 00:09:45,760
You, him and Brooke.

121
00:09:47,777 --> 00:09:50,819
The last thing I said to him was “I don’t like the person you’re becoming”

122
00:09:50,957 --> 00:09:53,333
and “The next time we see each other don’t talk to me”.

123
00:09:54,168 --> 00:09:55,121
You didn’t mean it.

124
00:09:55,473 --> 00:09:59,681
Peyton, what if I can’t take it back? What if he doesn’t forgive me.

125
00:09:59,733 --> 00:10:02,329
He will but you just need to see him.

126
00:10:04,807 --> 00:10:09,441
I’ll tell you what. Whenever you decide that you’re ready, I’ll go to the hospital with you.

127
00:10:11,412 --> 00:10:12,671
Strength in numbers.

128
00:10:13,829 --> 00:10:16,368
Yeah, yeah okay, thank you.

129
00:10:17,776 --> 00:10:18,616
I’ll see you.

130
00:10:30,158 --> 00:10:31,006
Hi.

131
00:10:32,557 --> 00:10:35,173
Nathan told me about Lucas. I’m so sorry.

132
00:10:36,193 --> 00:10:37,002
How is he?

133
00:10:37,462 --> 00:10:41,493
He’s still unconscious. But the doctors say his vital signs are strong.

134
00:10:42,071 --> 00:10:43,253
Oh, that’s good news.

135
00:10:44,641 --> 00:10:47,571
I figured you hadn’t had a chance to grab any food.

136
00:10:48,434 --> 00:10:50,572
I’m really not that hungry.

137
00:10:51,921 --> 00:10:55,541
Well, at least have some decent coffee.

138
00:10:58,567 --> 00:11:02,556
I don’t want you to worry about anything other than Lucas.

139
00:11:02,847 --> 00:11:05,219
I’ll take care of the café as long as you need.

140
00:11:06,841 --> 00:11:09,261
Thanks, Deb. I appreciate that.

141
00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:10,702
Here you go.

142
00:11:13,547 --> 00:11:20,000
All night I sat up watching Lucas. And I kept thinking I’m the one who can’t wake up.

143
00:11:21,379 --> 00:11:23,288
This has to be some sort of dream.

144
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:26,630
Cause if this isn’t a dream it’s got to be some sort of punishment.

145
00:11:27,930 --> 00:11:29,410
Punishment for what?

146
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:33,770
For being selfish. I mean, if I hadn’t gone to Italy, this wouldn’t have happened.

147
00:11:34,382 --> 00:11:37,745
You can’t think that way. This is not your fault.

148
00:11:39,291 --> 00:11:43,977
And if you had told me yesterday that the Scott brother that I would feel grateful to

149
00:11:44,033 --> 00:11:46,153
is Dan I would have said you were crazy.

150
00:11:47,397 --> 00:11:48,431
What do you mean?

151
00:11:49,609 --> 00:11:50,712
He didn’t tell you?

152
00:11:51,217 --> 00:11:52,062
Tell me what?

153
00:11:54,028 --> 00:11:56,241
Dan brought Lucas to the hospital.

154
00:11:57,003 --> 00:11:59,374
If it wasn’t for him, Lucas wouldn’t have made it.

155
00:12:11,667 --> 00:12:14,513
Hey, it’s me.

156
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:18,813
Can you hear me?

157
00:12:24,068 --> 00:12:26,135
Squeeze my hand if you can hear me, okay?

158
00:12:29,576 --> 00:12:30,411
Never mind.

159
00:12:31,706 --> 00:12:36,278
Um, I just came by to tell you that I’m probably not going to be around very much.

160
00:12:36,831 --> 00:12:38,930
With Brooke here it’s just kind of weird.

161
00:12:40,779 --> 00:12:43,087
But I’m with you Lucas, you know that.

162
00:12:44,885 --> 00:12:47,056
And I’ll wait forever if I have to.

163
00:12:51,352 --> 00:12:54,382
Oh, I’m sorry. Nobody was here.

164
00:12:54,593 --> 00:12:57,219
You don’t have to go. He’s allowed visitors.

165
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:58,545
Okay.

166
00:12:59,385 --> 00:13:00,281
I’m Peyton.

167
00:13:01,771 --> 00:13:04,802
I know. Lucas has talked about you.

168
00:13:10,276 --> 00:13:14,644
Its nice that people want to do something but the last thing I can think about right now is food.

169
00:13:15,252 --> 00:13:16,967
You’ll be glad you have it in a couple of days.

170
00:13:17,648 --> 00:13:20,930
I swear the cook at this hospital gets a bonus for making people sick.

171
00:13:21,578 --> 00:13:23,481
Sounds like you’ve spent some time here.

172
00:13:24,059 --> 00:13:26,644
Yeah, when my mom died.

173
00:13:28,072 --> 00:13:28,913
I’m sorry.

174
00:13:29,502 --> 00:13:30,075
No…

175
00:13:32,351 --> 00:13:33,464
How’d she die?

176
00:13:35,936 --> 00:13:37,007
A car accident.

177
00:13:41,518 --> 00:13:43,321
You’re a good friend to visit.

178
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:48,958
I’ve been expecting Haley to come on by.

179
00:13:49,450 --> 00:13:53,561
She and Lucas got in some argument and she’s really beating herself up over it.

180
00:13:55,377 --> 00:13:56,536
They’ll patch it up.

181
00:13:58,306 --> 00:14:00,314
Best friends can forgive each other anything.

182
00:14:04,415 --> 00:14:05,444
Hey stranger.

183
00:14:06,939 --> 00:14:11,511
Check it out, I dropped so much cash at the gift shop I think they’re going to name it after me.

184
00:14:12,127 --> 00:14:15,562
And I got something for you too Karen.

185
00:14:16,279 --> 00:14:18,264
Nothing makes me feel better when I’m blue than chocolate

186
00:14:18,321 --> 00:14:21,762
and I figured we could be in a better place if we dipped into a sugar coma so...

187
00:14:25,121 --> 00:14:28,781
- I’m sorry, I’m such an idiot I didn’t…
- It’s okay, Brooke.

188
00:14:36,772 --> 00:14:37,982
Hey baby.

189
00:14:42,156 --> 00:14:43,199
How you doing?

190
00:14:46,850 --> 00:14:48,980
Oh, listen, I got to go.

191
00:14:51,556 --> 00:14:55,672
Okay. I’ve got him now but, see you later?

192
00:14:56,483 --> 00:14:58,488
- Sure.
- Okay.

193
00:15:00,505 --> 00:15:02,200
It was really nice to meet you.

194
00:15:03,306 --> 00:15:04,345
You too.

195
00:15:17,017 --> 00:15:19,014
Here you go, enjoy your meal.

196
00:15:19,142 --> 00:15:19,992
How’s Lucas?

197
00:15:20,294 --> 00:15:23,454
- Like you care.
- Haley, come on, that’s not fair.

198
00:15:23,812 --> 00:15:26,024
Look, we’re not tight but I don’t want to see the guy in the hospital.

199
00:15:26,090 --> 00:15:29,279
Why, because if he’s out of circulation than you can’t use me to piss him off?

200
00:15:29,495 --> 00:15:31,895
Hey,  would you just stand still for a second so we could talk about this?

201
00:15:31,973 --> 00:15:33,125
Not a chance in hell.

202
00:15:33,616 --> 00:15:36,724
Alright fine, don’t talk to me, but at least let me take you to see Lucas today.

203
00:15:36,787 --> 00:15:39,330
You know what Peyton’s already doing it after my shift and even if she wasn’t

204
00:15:39,387 --> 00:15:40,458
I wouldn’t go with you.

205
00:15:44,384 --> 00:15:46,950
Hey, is she alright?

206
00:15:47,128 --> 00:15:48,584
No, not really.

207
00:15:50,538 --> 00:15:52,858
So this split with you and dad. This is real, huh?

208
00:15:53,601 --> 00:15:55,321
Yeah, honey it is.

209
00:15:56,657 --> 00:15:57,947
How do you feel about that?

210
00:15:59,216 --> 00:16:00,547
Actually I’m fine.

211
00:16:02,064 --> 00:16:03,430
How sad is that?

212
00:16:25,308 --> 00:16:26,238
I can’t.

213
00:16:29,245 --> 00:16:30,245
Haley, wait.

214
00:16:33,293 --> 00:16:35,267
- It’s alright.
- No it’s not.

215
00:16:35,324 --> 00:16:37,787
He’s lying in there and there’s nothing that I can do about it.

216
00:16:38,267 --> 00:16:41,899
Well, you could be there for him. Just go talk to him, you’ll feel better.

217
00:16:42,046 --> 00:16:43,367
I don’t deserve to feel better.

218
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:47,581
I mean, giving him an apology is not worth anything if he’s awake to hear it.

219
00:16:49,384 --> 00:16:54,052
You know if I go in there I’m just going to start crying and that’s just the last thing Karen needs.

220
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:57,800
Why don’t you let her be the judge of that?

221
00:16:58,932 --> 00:16:59,720
I cant.

222
00:17:09,229 --> 00:17:10,022
Hi.

223
00:17:11,256 --> 00:17:11,921
Hey.

224
00:17:12,572 --> 00:17:16,586
I just wanted to see how you were doing. I left a couple of messages about Lucas.

225
00:17:16,827 --> 00:17:19,678
Yeah, yeah. Thanks.

226
00:17:21,066 --> 00:17:22,664
Is there any change?

227
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:24,732
No.

228
00:17:26,663 --> 00:17:27,989
Have you talked to Karen today?

229
00:17:29,043 --> 00:17:30,523
She doesn’t want me at the hospital.

230
00:17:31,275 --> 00:17:33,974
I can’t say I blame her.

231
00:17:34,245 --> 00:17:36,324
Well, she’s just in shock right now, Keith.

232
00:17:37,126 --> 00:17:40,041
Once Lucas gets better things will go back to normal.

233
00:17:40,445 --> 00:17:42,335
I’m not so sure about that, Deb.

234
00:17:42,881 --> 00:17:46,579
Karen isn’t speaking to me, Lucas is unconscious and I’m to blame.

235
00:17:47,870 --> 00:17:49,707
That’s a tough one to bounce back from.

236
00:17:51,029 --> 00:17:52,954
Just give it some time.

237
00:17:56,979 --> 00:18:01,386
It’s funny, you know. I wasted all those years being too afraid to tell Karen how I felt.

238
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,755
And then she kissed me at the airport

239
00:18:06,158 --> 00:18:10,659
and suddenly, everything I hoped for seemed possible, all I had to do was wait 6 weeks.

240
00:18:12,105 --> 00:18:13,925
Just 6 weeks.

241
00:18:16,510 --> 00:18:18,631
Yesterday should have been the best day of my life.

242
00:18:20,177 --> 00:18:21,308
Now it’s all gone.

243
00:18:28,128 --> 00:18:29,541
You follow astrology?

244
00:18:31,279 --> 00:18:32,137
Not really.

245
00:18:32,777 --> 00:18:36,648
Me neither. It’s actually not as accurate as numerology.

246
00:18:40,355 --> 00:18:42,019
You two been dating a long time?

247
00:18:42,889 --> 00:18:44,329
A little over a month now.

248
00:18:45,818 --> 00:18:48,839
Ms. Roe? I’m Amy Quinn from the billing department.

249
00:18:48,906 --> 00:18:50,723
I had a couple of questions about your insurance.

250
00:18:50,928 --> 00:18:51,880
Sure, come in.

251
00:18:52,285 --> 00:18:54,871
I’ll just go do something.

252
00:18:56,850 --> 00:19:00,062
I was wondering if you had any supplemental insurance?

253
00:19:00,999 --> 00:19:03,744
No, just the regular hospitalization, why?

254
00:19:04,459 --> 00:19:09,544
Well, the care your son needs will almost certainly cost more than your coverage maximums.

255
00:19:10,128 --> 00:19:15,049
Oh wow. I never figured I’d need more than that.

256
00:19:15,626 --> 00:19:17,568
Expenses do add up these days.

257
00:19:19,068 --> 00:19:21,142
Could we set up some sort of payment plan?

258
00:19:21,577 --> 00:19:24,924
Why don’t you come talk to me after things settle down?

259
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:27,066
We’ll see what we can figure out.

260
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:28,837
Thank you.

261
00:19:37,736 --> 00:19:43,547
You never know dear how much I love you,

262
00:19:44,253 --> 00:19:49,440
please don't take my sunshine away.

263
00:19:51,437 --> 00:19:53,271
Open your eyes, Lucas.

264
00:19:55,371 --> 00:19:56,656
Come on, honey.

265
00:20:06,137 --> 00:20:08,897
Is there anything that didn’t change while I was gone?

266
00:20:12,859 --> 00:20:13,970
How’s he doing?

267
00:20:14,556 --> 00:20:15,194
The same.

268
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:17,099
How about you?

269
00:20:17,915 --> 00:20:18,922
I’m fine.

270
00:20:19,833 --> 00:20:24,032
You got a lot of talents, Karen, but lying is not one of them.

271
00:20:32,018 --> 00:20:35,414
When Lucas was a little boy we used to play this game.

272
00:20:36,084 --> 00:20:37,115
“What would you do”.

273
00:20:38,363 --> 00:20:43,104
What would you do if I blacked out? What would you do if the house caught fire?

274
00:20:44,332 --> 00:20:48,311
I was his only parent I wanted to prepare him if anything happened to me.

275
00:20:49,745 --> 00:20:54,952
But I wasn’t prepared for something happening to him.

276
00:20:57,435 --> 00:21:01,194
- Why don’t you take a break? 
- How could Keith be so careless?

277
00:21:02,197 --> 00:21:06,175
I trusted him with the only thing in the world that matters to me.

278
00:21:06,534 --> 00:21:08,607
Lucas matters to Keith too.

279
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:15,002
Look, Karen, you have every reason to be angry, Lord knows.

280
00:21:15,494 --> 00:21:20,593
But no man ever loved a boy anymore than Keith loves Lucas.

281
00:21:22,775 --> 00:21:24,500
That ought to count for something.

282
00:21:34,457 --> 00:21:36,814
Well, it looks like we all had the same idea, huh?

283
00:21:37,735 --> 00:21:40,248
Better to think of Lucas here than in the hospital, right?

284
00:21:40,455 --> 00:21:41,313
What, you seen him?

285
00:21:41,683 --> 00:21:44,554
Yeah, no change.

286
00:21:46,149 --> 00:21:47,258
This sucks.

287
00:21:49,629 --> 00:21:51,139
Hey Luke, its Mouth.

288
00:21:51,805 --> 00:21:54,897
I just want to say, we’re pulling for you.

289
00:21:55,271 --> 00:21:57,908
Right cause you the dawg. Yep you my dawg.

290
00:21:57,995 --> 00:22:01,711
Hey, don’t think I’m about to spot you any points when you bring your little scrawny ass

291
00:22:01,785 --> 00:22:04,180
back out on this court, man. Ain’t gonna happen.

292
00:22:04,859 --> 00:22:09,075
Yeah, spleen or no spleen, when you bust out, it’s on.

293
00:22:09,684 --> 00:22:12,674
And although the ethics of broadcasting prohibit me from gambling,

294
00:22:12,725 --> 00:22:15,541
I can say unofficially, my money’s on Scott.

295
00:22:15,598 --> 00:22:18,081
What money? You borrowed $10 from me last week.

296
00:22:18,154 --> 00:22:21,639
Hey Luke, Mouth can keep his cash if you come back soon, alright?

297
00:22:23,191 --> 00:22:24,250
Jake, any thoughts?

298
00:22:26,929 --> 00:22:29,749
We need you back man. Simple as that.

299
00:22:34,604 --> 00:22:37,623
What are you doing here? We’re supposed to meet at the mediator’s office.

300
00:22:37,686 --> 00:22:41,177
I  know. But I wanted to tell you in person, I’m not going.

301
00:22:42,638 --> 00:22:44,915
We both agreed to mediation.

302
00:22:45,146 --> 00:22:47,102
We also both agreed till death do us part.

303
00:22:47,423 --> 00:22:49,232
You didn’t have any trouble backing out of that one.

304
00:22:50,271 --> 00:22:52,560
Maybe you’re wrong about what’s best for this family too.

305
00:22:52,622 --> 00:22:56,032
What family? We haven’t been one in a long time.

306
00:22:56,081 --> 00:22:57,737
That doesn’t mean we cant be one again.

307
00:22:58,304 --> 00:23:00,557
We chose each other. We built a life together.

308
00:23:00,901 --> 00:23:02,359
Doesn’t that mean anything to you?

309
00:23:02,426 --> 00:23:07,516
Don’t put this on me, Dan. We’ve both made mistakes, it’s time to correct them.

310
00:23:07,571 --> 00:23:09,272
Our marriage was not a mistake.

311
00:23:10,189 --> 00:23:14,463
And Nathan is too important to me to just see him on the weekends. He needs both of us.

312
00:23:14,626 --> 00:23:17,043
Don’t make me hire a lawyer.

313
00:23:17,121 --> 00:23:19,716
I’m asking you not to. And I’m asking you to remember,

314
00:23:19,752 --> 00:23:21,990
when you were the one who needed forgiveness.

315
00:23:23,152 --> 00:23:25,512
When you were the one who almost lost this family.

316
00:23:26,470 --> 00:23:28,149
That was a long time ago.

317
00:23:28,661 --> 00:23:32,195
Exactly. And we made it through that.

318
00:23:33,479 --> 00:23:34,790
And I’m glad we did.

319
00:23:35,549 --> 00:23:36,996
So don’t throw us away.

320
00:23:37,985 --> 00:23:39,526
Give us one more chance.

321
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:44,697
I’m all out of chances, Dan.

322
00:23:46,715 --> 00:23:49,622
I may not show it in the way you want but this family is my life.

323
00:23:50,134 --> 00:23:53,647
I’m not giving up. I wont agree to a divorce.

324
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:02,305
Deb said I might find you up here.

325
00:24:03,093 --> 00:24:04,824
- Hey.
- This place is cool.

326
00:24:06,222 --> 00:24:11,825
Yeah, it is. Lucas and I built this, back when it was the two of us against the world.

327
00:24:12,796 --> 00:24:15,545
- Sorry I ran out of the hospital. 
- No, don’t sweat it.

328
00:24:16,391 --> 00:24:19,022
I’m probably not the best person to be giving moral support anyway.

329
00:24:19,908 --> 00:24:21,627
Maybe if you went with Nathan.

330
00:24:21,695 --> 00:24:24,331
Nathan and I are taking a little break.

331
00:24:24,704 --> 00:24:27,732
- What happened?
- He was using me to get to Lucas.

332
00:24:27,962 --> 00:24:33,953
Okay, Haley, I don’t believe that. I know Nathan and he’s into you.

333
00:24:34,019 --> 00:24:34,971
It doesn’t matter.

334
00:24:38,161 --> 00:24:41,924
Anyway why do you think that you’re no good for moral support?

335
00:24:43,010 --> 00:24:46,163
You said that you were disappointed in Lucas for betraying Brooke

336
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:49,875
and I just figured you felt the same way about me.

337
00:24:50,941 --> 00:24:52,230
Actually, no I don’t.

338
00:24:53,913 --> 00:24:56,972
I know what it’s like to need Lucas in your life.

339
00:24:58,237 --> 00:25:01,299
I never let myself need anybody. Ever.

340
00:25:02,214 --> 00:25:03,613
Not since my mom died.

341
00:25:04,965 --> 00:25:09,542
But with Lucas, he looks at me and he really sees me.

342
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:12,879
You know? Just right down into my soul.

343
00:25:15,313 --> 00:25:18,436
I just want to tell him that I love him and I’m sorry.

344
00:25:18,830 --> 00:25:20,858
I just want to tell him I’m in love with him.

345
00:25:26,182 --> 00:25:26,941
Yeah.

346
00:25:29,628 --> 00:25:31,901
Excuse me, could I drop this off for Lucas Scott?

347
00:25:32,069 --> 00:25:34,359
It’s visiting hours, you could give it to him yourself.

348
00:25:35,772 --> 00:25:37,984
Could you just let him know it’s from Keith Scott?

349
00:25:39,468 --> 00:25:40,139
Thank you.

350
00:25:41,537 --> 00:25:43,913
Oh wait. You’re my sticky note.

351
00:25:44,358 --> 00:25:47,072
Billings got some questions about a payment discrepancy.

352
00:25:47,118 --> 00:25:49,489
They need to talk to Lucas Scott’s mother or father.

353
00:25:50,444 --> 00:25:51,654
That’s you, right?

354
00:25:54,994 --> 00:25:56,718
Which way is the billing department?

355
00:26:00,569 --> 00:26:02,991
That hospital seriously needs a makeover.

356
00:26:03,185 --> 00:26:05,924
You know, it’s not a wonder to me that everyone who’s there is sick.

357
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:07,300
How’s Lucas?

358
00:26:07,954 --> 00:26:09,568
He’s the same.

359
00:26:10,275 --> 00:26:12,104
Kind of scares me.

360
00:26:12,851 --> 00:26:13,506
Why?

361
00:26:14,546 --> 00:26:17,639
I know what the doctors said, I’m just worried he’s not going to wake up.

362
00:26:17,777 --> 00:26:18,980
Brooke, don’t think that.

363
00:26:19,851 --> 00:26:20,643
I know.

364
00:26:22,266 --> 00:26:24,346
It’s just the thought of losing him now.

365
00:26:27,928 --> 00:26:34,800
Anyway... I was going to go and grab a bite to eat and then go back over there.

366
00:26:35,367 --> 00:26:36,450
You want to go with me?

367
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:39,874
You know, I cant, right now.

368
00:26:40,946 --> 00:26:41,846
Maybe later?

369
00:26:42,983 --> 00:26:44,601
You’ve been saying that for two days.

370
00:26:48,149 --> 00:26:50,591
Look, I know it’s hard for you.

371
00:26:51,323 --> 00:26:54,708
- You do? 
- I know your mom died in that hospital.

372
00:26:57,625 --> 00:27:02,772
Lucas needs his friends right now and even if it’s hard to be around him in that place,

373
00:27:03,130 --> 00:27:04,298
he’s worth the trouble.

374
00:27:06,550 --> 00:27:08,891
Yeah, he is.

375
00:27:10,895 --> 00:27:12,786
I’ll try to come by tomorrow.

376
00:27:14,794 --> 00:27:15,823
You’re the best.

377
00:27:18,596 --> 00:27:19,580
I‘ll see ya.

378
00:27:27,336 --> 00:27:32,789
Let’s see, LeBron James is first among rookies in points and assists per game.

379
00:27:32,959 --> 00:27:34,947
Carmelo Anthony is second.

380
00:27:36,393 --> 00:27:37,768
You a big basketball fan?

381
00:27:38,269 --> 00:27:40,804
It’s important to Lucas so I like to try and keep up.

382
00:27:41,003 --> 00:27:41,987
Yeah, I know what you mean.

383
00:27:42,478 --> 00:27:44,639
I’m suffering through Salinger for him.

384
00:27:45,059 --> 00:27:47,582
Would it kill a guy to read a little Jackie Cohens?

385
00:27:48,986 --> 00:27:50,972
- Did you make that?
- Yeah.

386
00:27:53,645 --> 00:27:57,627
I figured it’d be nice for Lucas to have when he wakes up.

387
00:28:00,557 --> 00:28:02,237
That’s us at a Bear Creek game,

388
00:28:02,308 --> 00:28:06,870
and those are coasters from the place where I kicked his butt playing pool.

389
00:28:08,385 --> 00:28:10,182
Nothing from the tattoo parlor?

390
00:28:13,450 --> 00:28:15,221
Okay, that’s totally on me.

391
00:28:15,283 --> 00:28:19,475
He’s just so serious all the time, you know, I thought a tattoo might lighten him up.

392
00:28:19,634 --> 00:28:21,416
And you couldn’t take him to a comedy?

393
00:28:22,174 --> 00:28:23,945
So you’re not a big tattoo fan.

394
00:28:24,724 --> 00:28:26,438
Not on my son. No.

395
00:28:28,788 --> 00:28:29,746
I’m sorry.

396
00:28:31,303 --> 00:28:32,255
Honestly,

397
00:28:34,022 --> 00:28:37,678
I think I could probably set myself on fire and my mom wouldn’t notice, so...

398
00:28:38,214 --> 00:28:40,370
it’s kind of hard to remember that some moms would.

399
00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:55,535
What is this?

400
00:28:56,186 --> 00:28:59,329
It started last night. People wanted to do something for Lucas.

401
00:29:00,441 --> 00:29:05,275
Is that Tim? He’s always been such an ass to Lucas.

402
00:29:05,397 --> 00:29:07,353
Maybe it’s his way of saying he’s sorry.

403
00:29:08,383 --> 00:29:09,206
Wow.

404
00:29:11,731 --> 00:29:13,944
Why am I not surprised Nathan isn’t here.

405
00:29:23,585 --> 00:29:27,471
Hey, you gotta love watching people make sense out of the way they feel for Lucas.

406
00:29:27,787 --> 00:29:29,538
Yeah, who knew Tim could spell, right?

407
00:29:29,747 --> 00:29:33,485
Yeah right. So how are you doing?

408
00:29:34,528 --> 00:29:35,770
Hanging in I guess.

409
00:29:37,531 --> 00:29:39,727
Hey look I know we don’t really run together but...

410
00:29:40,249 --> 00:29:42,297
if you need someone to talk to, I’m around.

411
00:29:42,922 --> 00:29:43,890
Thanks, Jake.

412
00:29:57,068 --> 00:29:58,493
Your free throws look like crap.

413
00:29:59,321 --> 00:30:01,764
Glad to see you’re picking up the slack in my dad’s absence.

414
00:30:01,948 --> 00:30:02,618
He’s not around?

415
00:30:03,583 --> 00:30:04,718
He moved out.

416
00:30:05,757 --> 00:30:07,048
My parents are getting a divorce.

417
00:30:07,863 --> 00:30:11,273
Oh wow, um. I’m sorry, Nathan, I didn’t know.

418
00:30:11,522 --> 00:30:13,910
It’s alright. They suck together anyways.

419
00:30:15,716 --> 00:30:17,958
Speaking of. What are you doing here?

420
00:30:19,673 --> 00:30:21,675
Haley. Actually.

421
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:25,122
Um, listen I don’t know what you did to her

422
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:28,476
but I do know that she’s the best thing that’s ever happened to you.

423
00:30:29,504 --> 00:30:30,960
You including yourself in that?

424
00:30:31,948 --> 00:30:34,122
Yeah, I am.

425
00:30:36,856 --> 00:30:38,172
Well yeah, she is.

426
00:30:39,350 --> 00:30:40,610
She just doesn’t believe me.

427
00:30:42,012 --> 00:30:43,364
So what happened?

428
00:30:45,151 --> 00:30:48,714
I told her that I only went after her at first to screw with Lucas.

429
00:30:49,585 --> 00:30:51,654
You’re a real jackass, you know that?

430
00:30:52,698 --> 00:30:56,866
Yeah, I was. But it hasn’t been about that with me and Haley for a long time.

431
00:30:59,511 --> 00:31:01,427
Nathan, Haley needs your help.

432
00:31:02,175 --> 00:31:03,660
She can’t face Lucas.

433
00:31:05,287 --> 00:31:07,101
That’s not really my place, is it?

434
00:31:08,503 --> 00:31:10,772
I mean, Lucas isn’t exactly my biggest fan.

435
00:31:12,308 --> 00:31:15,903
Doesn’t mean you couldn’t try. For Haley.

436
00:31:18,698 --> 00:31:20,976
So is this advice for me or for you?

437
00:31:24,575 --> 00:31:28,610
Well, this is kind of weird, huh? The two of us talking about each others relationships.

438
00:31:29,282 --> 00:31:31,272
- It’s all weird. 
- Yeah.

439
00:31:35,778 --> 00:31:37,590
Thank you for making time to see me

440
00:31:37,672 --> 00:31:39,945
No problem. Sorry you had to wait.

441
00:31:40,826 --> 00:31:43,284
Okay, here’s your receipt.

442
00:31:45,410 --> 00:31:50,012
Um, I’m sorry, I’m a little tired. I don’t understand.

443
00:31:50,130 --> 00:31:55,249
The bill’s been taken care of, if you accrue any other expenses we’ll charge the credit card on file.

444
00:31:55,393 --> 00:31:56,560
What credit card?

445
00:31:57,697 --> 00:31:59,003
Who paid this bill?

446
00:31:59,323 --> 00:32:02,101
Let me just check. Your husband.

447
00:32:04,629 --> 00:32:05,878
Keith Scott.

448
00:32:18,608 --> 00:32:19,805
Are you okay?

449
00:32:20,343 --> 00:32:23,636
Ever since I landed, nothing has been the way I expected it to be.

450
00:32:25,709 --> 00:32:28,172
Including your son’s new girlfriend, right?

451
00:32:28,678 --> 00:32:30,992
That’s not true, I don’t really know you, Brooke.

452
00:32:31,187 --> 00:32:35,344
Look I know I talk a lot when I’m nervous, actually I’m pretty gabby all the time.

453
00:32:35,467 --> 00:32:38,141
But my stupid quotient kind of goes sky high when I’m flipped out

454
00:32:38,182 --> 00:32:41,217
and meeting my boyfriend’s mother in the hospital with all this going on

455
00:32:41,270 --> 00:32:43,936
is pretty much off the stress charts for me. But...

456
00:32:45,156 --> 00:32:47,668
I’m here for you if you need anything.

457
00:32:48,866 --> 00:32:49,763
Thank you.

458
00:32:52,430 --> 00:32:58,503
And, just so you know. The only thing I really want to see is Lucas laugh again.

459
00:32:59,542 --> 00:33:03,620
You know, hear him sing off key and watch him roll his eyes at me

460
00:33:03,695 --> 00:33:05,759
when I steal French fries off his plate.

461
00:33:06,112 --> 00:33:09,276
I guess what I’m trying to say is I’m crazy about your son.

462
00:33:09,685 --> 00:33:11,360
And I hope that’s enough for you.

463
00:33:12,225 --> 00:33:14,830
Actually that’s more than enough.

464
00:33:19,704 --> 00:33:23,202
I figured if I kept bringing food you’re bound to eat sometime.

465
00:33:23,259 --> 00:33:24,836
Oh my God, I’m starving.

466
00:33:26,207 --> 00:33:28,896
But that’s probably not for me.

467
00:33:29,433 --> 00:33:32,895
Example of that stupid quotient thing. Okay, I think I’m just going to go.

468
00:33:32,986 --> 00:33:36,330
No no, why don’t you stay? We could have dinner together.

469
00:33:36,494 --> 00:33:38,104
I mean, if you’re interested.

470
00:33:40,128 --> 00:33:42,622
- I’d like that.
- Good.

471
00:33:43,525 --> 00:33:44,738
I’ll go get drinks.

472
00:33:52,028 --> 00:33:53,159
That looks great. 

473
00:33:53,328 --> 00:33:57,959
Oh yeah, a start up company gave us 100 for free as a test run.

474
00:33:58,249 --> 00:34:02,889
I know it’s the last thing on your mind but business is fine.

475
00:34:04,019 --> 00:34:06,831
It’s a strange world when the least important thing is doing well,

476
00:34:06,862 --> 00:34:09,971
and the most important thing is just hanging on.

477
00:34:11,147 --> 00:34:15,893
Yeah. Is there anything else I can do?

478
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:19,775
Yeah, could you thank Dan for me?

479
00:34:19,927 --> 00:34:21,898
I haven’t had a chance, things have been so crazy,

480
00:34:21,950 --> 00:34:24,924
but as soon as I can leave the hospital I’ll stop by the house.

481
00:34:25,585 --> 00:34:27,853
Dan isn’t living at the house anymore.

482
00:34:28,947 --> 00:34:29,989
What do you mean?

483
00:34:30,572 --> 00:34:31,688
We’re getting a divorce.

484
00:34:34,913 --> 00:34:38,416
This may sound crazy but I’m sorry.

485
00:34:39,734 --> 00:34:40,689
Thanks.

486
00:34:43,807 --> 00:34:44,657
See ya.

487
00:34:49,183 --> 00:34:50,284
It was only six weeks.

488
00:35:10,764 --> 00:35:12,413
That car is perfect for you.

489
00:35:13,621 --> 00:35:14,440
How is that?

490
00:35:14,897 --> 00:35:16,862
Smooth lines, sleek styling.

491
00:35:18,641 --> 00:35:19,515
Dan Scott.

492
00:35:20,303 --> 00:35:24,066
Pleasure to meet you, Dan. Cynthia Price. Your wife’s new attorney.

493
00:35:26,402 --> 00:35:30,441
I came here to tell you I’ve read the mediation agreement and I think it’s more than fair.

494
00:35:30,532 --> 00:35:32,898
I wanted to give you a last chance to accept it.

495
00:35:33,282 --> 00:35:36,733
Sorry sweat heart, I’ve got a lot invested in my marriage and my family.

496
00:35:37,216 --> 00:35:39,205
Deb’s not getting rid of me that easy.

497
00:35:39,488 --> 00:35:42,054
Is that love talking or just a bruised ego?

498
00:35:42,414 --> 00:35:46,537
Roll the dice and find out. But first, you go back to your client

499
00:35:46,595 --> 00:35:50,092
and you ask her if she’s ready for what will come out about her if she does go to trial.

500
00:35:55,110 --> 00:35:56,005
See you in court.

501
00:36:10,141 --> 00:36:10,853
Hey man.

502
00:36:12,896 --> 00:36:14,258
I kind of need to talk to you.

503
00:36:22,163 --> 00:36:26,178
So I’m here because everything’s screwed up.

504
00:36:31,292 --> 00:36:34,611
I know you don’t trust me with Haley,

505
00:36:35,896 --> 00:36:38,420
but I like her a lot, you know?

506
00:36:40,078 --> 00:36:41,712
She’s hurting right now too.

507
00:36:43,771 --> 00:36:45,767
She needs you to open your eyes, man.

508
00:36:47,775 --> 00:36:49,657
She feels like she can’t be forgiven.

509
00:36:52,043 --> 00:36:53,904
And I’m sort of in the same place.

510
00:37:10,339 --> 00:37:15,440
This accident, might not turn out so bad, you know?

511
00:37:16,913 --> 00:37:18,680
You get to take a break from the game.

512
00:37:19,811 --> 00:37:22,114
The pressure and peoples expectations.

513
00:37:24,997 --> 00:37:26,606
I wish I had that chance.

514
00:37:27,861 --> 00:37:29,538
This might be hard to believe but...

515
00:37:30,844 --> 00:37:32,242
maybe you’re the lucky one.

516
00:37:34,936 --> 00:37:35,995
You can get out.

517
00:37:50,281 --> 00:37:51,151
Hey.

518
00:37:54,559 --> 00:37:55,584
Water.

519
00:38:19,012 --> 00:38:20,145
What are you doing here?

520
00:38:22,890 --> 00:38:23,965
It’s a long story.

521
00:38:25,112 --> 00:38:26,044
Let me get your mom.

522
00:38:42,346 --> 00:38:43,104
Nathan?

523
00:38:43,871 --> 00:38:45,884
I think Lucas wants to talk to you.

524
00:38:52,501 --> 00:38:53,287
Lucas?

525
00:38:54,490 --> 00:38:56,140
Wake up sweetie, come on.

526
00:38:56,455 --> 00:38:57,352
Talk to me.

527
00:39:00,851 --> 00:39:06,307
Don’t take my sunshine away.

528
00:39:07,234 --> 00:39:08,432
You heard that.

529
00:39:12,222 --> 00:39:14,306
I’m glad your back, mom.

530
00:39:15,498 --> 00:39:16,526
You too.

531
00:39:18,656 --> 00:39:21,213
Now I can kill you for that tattoo.

532
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:34,765
Nathan, I am not in the mood right now, okay?

533
00:39:36,895 --> 00:39:38,175
Lucas’ is awake.

534
00:39:40,403 --> 00:39:43,935
I was there when he opened his eyes. I went to see him.

535
00:39:45,796 --> 00:39:46,744
Why?

536
00:39:47,497 --> 00:39:48,650
Cause I knew you couldn’t.

537
00:39:50,612 --> 00:39:52,920
I wanted him to know that you were thinking about him.

538
00:39:56,317 --> 00:39:59,873
Look, I know that it was wrong to go after you for the reasons that I did.

539
00:40:01,395 --> 00:40:04,200
I can’t apologize for it. I’m glad I did it.

540
00:40:06,095 --> 00:40:08,840
I’m not that person anymore. It’s because of you.

541
00:40:12,290 --> 00:40:13,600
Let me take you to him.

542
00:41:17,219 --> 00:41:20,986
He handed me the consent forms, he needed surgery you have a right to be upset but...

543
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,392
Thank you.

544
00:41:57,794 --> 00:42:01,865
Hey buddy. I missed you.
