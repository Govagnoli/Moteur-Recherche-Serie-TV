1
00:01:57,725 --> 00:01:58,838
Come on baby.

2
00:02:14,357 --> 00:02:15,478
We need some music.

3
00:02:17,376 --> 00:02:18,268
Peyton!

4
00:02:21,253 --> 00:02:22,145
Sorry...

5
00:02:23,122 --> 00:02:24,237
Where the hell are we?

6
00:02:24,949 --> 00:02:26,736
Miles from normal.

7
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,123
What is she doing here?

8
00:02:33,535 --> 00:02:34,873
You invited her!

9
00:02:40,043 --> 00:02:40,955
Ow!

10
00:02:52,398 --> 00:02:53,443
- Bail!
- Bail!

11
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:04,240
Nice. What's next?

12
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:06,640
- Uh, you pick.
- Alright.

13
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:26,470
Could this night get any freakier?

14
00:03:27,384 --> 00:03:29,073
Nathan with Lucas.

15
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:30,921
Haley and Peyton?

16
00:03:31,357 --> 00:03:32,836
What the hell is going on?

17
00:03:49,129 --> 00:03:49,824
Hey stranger.

18
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:51,612
No stranger than you.

19
00:03:52,339 --> 00:03:56,374
- Did you get my message last night?
- Nah. I was at the library late. Midterms.

20
00:03:56,686 --> 00:03:58,478
- Yours or Nathan's?
- Both, actually.

21
00:03:58,878 --> 00:04:01,160
- Well. Good luck with that.
- Luke.

22
00:04:01,857 --> 00:04:06,389
You're cool with this, right? I mean, last week, when you said you didn't trust me...

23
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:11,120
I know. I didn't mean that. Alright? I meant I don't trust Nathan.

24
00:04:12,333 --> 00:04:13,464
Hey, you got a second?

25
00:04:14,446 --> 00:04:15,738
Speaking of...

26
00:04:18,882 --> 00:04:20,894
So last week... sucked.

27
00:04:21,395 --> 00:04:23,305
I just... wanted to say thanks.

28
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:26,521
- Oh, you made me a mix?
- Just trying to square my karma.

29
00:04:26,791 --> 00:04:29,419
Uh-huh. Does this mean we're dating?

30
00:04:30,136 --> 00:04:32,937
Listen, you've got a long bus ride tonight and I had some free time.

31
00:04:33,377 --> 00:04:34,709
Don't read too much into it.

32
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:39,326
Haley!

33
00:04:40,432 --> 00:04:41,492
- Hey!
- Hey.

34
00:04:41,876 --> 00:04:45,081
- Coming to the game tonight?
- Um... I don't know.

35
00:04:45,484 --> 00:04:48,317
You should come. We always beat the crap out of the Pickerington Hicks.

36
00:04:48,374 --> 00:04:50,683
- They're called the Hicks?
- Well no. But they should be.

37
00:04:50,738 --> 00:04:52,367
The place is all pickup trucks and mulch.

38
00:04:55,458 --> 00:04:57,293
It's definitely worth the road trip.

39
00:04:58,107 --> 00:04:59,146
I'll look for you.

40
00:05:00,343 --> 00:05:01,225
Okay.

41
00:05:07,282 --> 00:05:08,925
Dan! We should get going.

42
00:05:10,369 --> 00:05:14,020
What is wrong with these people? Putting an SPL dinner on a game night?

43
00:05:14,163 --> 00:05:19,033
Honey, it's once a year. We'll go, we'll enjoy a nice, adult evening downtown.

44
00:05:19,206 --> 00:05:21,213
And tomorrow you can pour over the box scores.

45
00:05:21,243 --> 00:05:24,095
I still don't understand why we booked a room. It's only a thirty minute drive.

46
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:29,472
Because you and your wife are in need of some good, old fashioned alone time.

47
00:05:30,911 --> 00:05:32,251
I like the sound of that.

48
00:05:33,247 --> 00:05:35,897
Well Nathan's got his cell. I can keep tabs on the game from dinner.

49
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:40,342
Dan, why don't we spend 48 hours without basketball and see where we wind up?

50
00:05:40,921 --> 00:05:42,702
- Okay?
- Sure.

51
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:43,644
Thank you.

52
00:05:47,821 --> 00:05:48,539
Okay.

53
00:05:50,403 --> 00:05:52,159
What does this dress say to you?

54
00:05:52,421 --> 00:05:54,984
Uh... beware of crazy ladies who talk to dresses.

55
00:05:55,276 --> 00:05:57,766
No, come on. Really. I need your help.

56
00:05:58,502 --> 00:06:01,663
Single and successful or married to her work?

57
00:06:02,395 --> 00:06:05,430
- Is this for that justice league thing?
- Small business league.

58
00:06:05,502 --> 00:06:09,439
And yes. It's one of the few times a year I get to dress up and I'd like to look nice.

59
00:06:09,512 --> 00:06:10,852
Well, is Keith still going as your date?

60
00:06:11,323 --> 00:06:13,095
He's not a date. We're just going together.

61
00:06:13,443 --> 00:06:14,467
Why would you say that?

62
00:06:14,759 --> 00:06:17,273
You guys hang out a lot. You get along well...

63
00:06:17,329 --> 00:06:19,516
Yeah, well I get along with the guy who delivers our water.

64
00:06:19,556 --> 00:06:20,698
That doesn't mean I'm gonna date him.

65
00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:23,003
Yeah, but the guy who delivers our water is not Keith.

66
00:06:23,084 --> 00:06:24,872
Where is this coming from?

67
00:06:25,209 --> 00:06:29,515
Well, you know I've been thinking, you know, that you're not exactly old, Mom.

68
00:06:29,916 --> 00:06:31,896
Thanks... I think.

69
00:06:32,111 --> 00:06:35,429
I'm just saying that I'd be all right with it, you know...

70
00:06:35,951 --> 00:06:37,051
if that's what you're worried about.

71
00:06:37,385 --> 00:06:41,686
Well, thank you, Cupid. Now, help with the dresses, please.

72
00:06:42,135 --> 00:06:45,192
- Black, I guess.
- Hmm. Black it is.

73
00:06:48,541 --> 00:06:50,605
Keith didn't say something to you, did he?

74
00:06:50,938 --> 00:06:54,455
Oh, you mean about the date that you two aren't going on tonight?

75
00:06:55,095 --> 00:06:56,273
Not a word...

76
00:06:57,660 --> 00:06:59,145
Good luck with your game.

77
00:06:59,467 --> 00:07:00,567
Yeah, you too, Mom.

78
00:07:12,737 --> 00:07:14,295
Safe yet?

79
00:07:16,487 --> 00:07:19,042
No hostile tone, no bitter complaints,

80
00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:22,840
no yelling at your best friend because you broke up with your jerk of a boyfriend?

81
00:07:23,752 --> 00:07:25,369
Oh my god, a smile!

82
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:29,819
Alright. I was a mess last week. I'm sorry.

83
00:07:32,168 --> 00:07:36,634
Apology accepted! A-P-O. L-O-G. Y?

84
00:07:36,849 --> 00:07:40,909
Because I love you. Get your skinny ass up and lets go beat the pirates.

85
00:07:42,287 --> 00:07:44,887
- What are you doing?
- What? It's a web cam. It's what they're for.

86
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:45,717
Come on.

87
00:07:46,551 --> 00:07:47,514
Overweight.

88
00:07:48,671 --> 00:07:50,673
- Now we're even.
- You're dead!

89
00:07:50,894 --> 00:07:51,737
Dead!

90
00:07:59,382 --> 00:08:01,093
Alright! Knock it off.

91
00:08:04,917 --> 00:08:06,853
This is our first away game.

92
00:08:07,472 --> 00:08:09,720
For those of you who are unfamiliar,

93
00:08:10,257 --> 00:08:14,072
you sit there with your mouths shut and focus.

94
00:08:15,449 --> 00:08:17,748
I'll choose the music.

95
00:08:18,776 --> 00:08:21,824
Tonight's theme is defense.

96
00:08:27,983 --> 00:08:28,967
Lets roll!

97
00:08:45,131 --> 00:08:47,991
Good evening, ladies and gentleman, from the stinks of Pickerington

98
00:08:48,038 --> 00:08:50,915
where the pirates always suck and the livestock is nervous,

99
00:08:51,278 --> 00:08:55,078
I'm Mouth McFadden and sitting in with me at tonight's away game is Haley James.

100
00:08:55,176 --> 00:08:57,019
Haley,  how do you see tonight's match up?

101
00:08:57,271 --> 00:09:00,604
I'd rather not be associated with your lunacy, Mouth.

102
00:09:01,294 --> 00:09:05,206
Oh, see, Lucas looks even hotter in blue. You should totally hook up with him.

103
00:09:05,302 --> 00:09:06,445
- Stop it.
- What?

104
00:09:06,583 --> 00:09:09,912
At the very least you're due for a little rebound action unless you're still into Nathan.

105
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:10,740
I'm not.

106
00:09:11,535 --> 00:09:15,938
Alright. Since you're my pal you can have a courtesy hold on Lucas for the weekend,

107
00:09:16,121 --> 00:09:19,850
- but after that he's fair game.
- He's already fair game, thanks.

108
00:09:19,951 --> 00:09:21,958
So what's the story with that one anyway?

109
00:09:22,773 --> 00:09:25,231
She's tutoring Nathan... supposedly.

110
00:09:25,486 --> 00:09:26,935
And  hanging out with Lucas.

111
00:09:27,365 --> 00:09:30,658
Right... we're supposed to believe she's just friends with both of them?

112
00:09:33,236 --> 00:09:34,604
Did you see that?

113
00:09:35,155 --> 00:09:37,334
- What?
- Nathan just gave her the nod.

114
00:09:37,774 --> 00:09:41,333
- What nod?
- The “lets hook up after the game” nod.

115
00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:45,271
Wanna know what I think? I think Nathan likes tutor girl.

116
00:09:45,322 --> 00:09:48,670
But I think tutor girl likes Lucas. And I know I like Lucas.

117
00:09:48,727 --> 00:09:50,656
And I don't know who the hell you like anymore.

118
00:09:51,414 --> 00:09:53,549
This is all turning into one big love...

119
00:09:56,027 --> 00:09:58,690
rectangle plus one, whatever that is.

120
00:10:00,738 --> 00:10:04,005
So as you've heard Ravens have the big lead early in the second quarter.

121
00:10:06,523 --> 00:10:08,449
Ooh. And that's a foul by Nathan Scott.

122
00:10:09,371 --> 00:10:11,957
Hey. Why don't you try putting your hands up on defense, alright?

123
00:10:12,049 --> 00:10:14,558
- Why don't you try not getting beat?
- Why don't I just beat your ass?

124
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:15,817
Moron...

125
00:10:18,535 --> 00:10:19,939
Keep it up, punk.

126
00:10:21,157 --> 00:10:21,931
Ball in!

127
00:10:25,504 --> 00:10:28,063
Hey, you gonna talk or you gonna play, Daddy's boy?

128
00:10:28,331 --> 00:10:31,854
Hey, Haley's looking pretty fine tonight, right? Can't wait to get with that.

129
00:10:38,031 --> 00:10:40,271
Hey. So I saw Nathan in the shower...

130
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:42,467
yeah, no wonder you broke up with him.

131
00:11:01,698 --> 00:11:04,056
You two! You're out of here!

132
00:11:04,417 --> 00:11:06,648
You're throwing them both out of the game?

133
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:08,641
I got to, Coach. I got things rolling.

134
00:11:09,618 --> 00:11:11,697
They're on the same team!

135
00:11:13,311 --> 00:11:15,221
Ow! Pain!

136
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:28,538
Nathan Scott! Lucas Scott! On your feet!

137
00:11:31,988 --> 00:11:33,909
Congratulations, boys.

138
00:11:34,174 --> 00:11:38,152
In all my years of coaching, this has got to be a low point.

139
00:11:38,748 --> 00:11:44,211
That little stunt you pulled almost cost us our undefeated record.

140
00:11:45,598 --> 00:11:51,296
I don't give diddlee-squat about your issues with your daddy or your girlfriends.

141
00:11:51,368 --> 00:11:54,829
As far as I'm concerned, you can hate each other until hell freezes over.

142
00:11:55,551 --> 00:11:57,783
But if you're going to play on my team,

143
00:11:58,336 --> 00:12:00,972
you're gonna learn how to work together.

144
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:04,310
I can't see that happening, Whitey?

145
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:09,540
Yeah? Well you've got thirty-some-odd miles to figure it out.

146
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,950
They can't just leave us here.

147
00:12:18,586 --> 00:12:19,687
Nice work, idiot.

148
00:12:22,038 --> 00:12:24,018
This is great. This is friggin' great.

149
00:12:24,752 --> 00:12:26,654
- Calm down.
- You calm down, man.

150
00:12:26,716 --> 00:12:29,206
My phone's on that bus. My wallet's on that bus.

151
00:12:29,276 --> 00:12:30,271
Yeah, my wallet too!

152
00:12:30,896 --> 00:12:32,491
So what the hell do we do now?

153
00:12:33,491 --> 00:12:34,668
We start walking.

154
00:12:49,362 --> 00:12:51,043
Ow, that's too tight.

155
00:12:51,677 --> 00:12:53,454
- There. How's that?
- Too loose.

156
00:12:54,979 --> 00:12:56,280
Ow, that's too tight.

157
00:12:59,246 --> 00:13:00,869
So you're in college, right?

158
00:13:01,626 --> 00:13:02,439
Junior.

159
00:13:02,896 --> 00:13:05,200
Oh... you know, I love college guys.

160
00:13:06,551 --> 00:13:08,415
Two more years, you'll be a doctor.

161
00:13:09,076 --> 00:13:11,221
Uh, not exactly.

162
00:13:12,065 --> 00:13:13,903
So tell me, Doctor College Boy.

163
00:13:14,072 --> 00:13:17,498
If you wanted to give me something for the pain, you could, right?

164
00:13:17,877 --> 00:13:19,771
Well, the team doctor would have to...

165
00:13:26,244 --> 00:13:28,362
I could maybe do that.

166
00:13:33,564 --> 00:13:35,879
Wait. You're not a cop, are you?

167
00:13:36,846 --> 00:13:37,594
No.

168
00:13:42,585 --> 00:13:44,188
Well, and one for tomorrow...

169
00:13:44,762 --> 00:13:45,622
please.

170
00:13:49,136 --> 00:13:51,833
Okay, here's the thing. Those are really strong painkillers.

171
00:13:51,869 --> 00:13:55,809
So just take, like, a half of one. Every twelve hours.

172
00:13:58,392 --> 00:13:59,655
Oops! All gone!

173
00:14:04,157 --> 00:14:06,230
We wouldn't be out here if you never joined the team.

174
00:14:06,431 --> 00:14:09,446
No. We wouldn't be out here if you weren't such a jackass about me joining the team.

175
00:14:09,886 --> 00:14:12,396
Why do you want my life so bad anyway, man?

176
00:14:12,478 --> 00:14:15,555
Dude, don't flatter yourself, alright? You're about the last person I want to trade places with.

177
00:14:15,621 --> 00:14:19,589
Oh yeah? Well all I know is you came out nowhere and started grabbing everything you could from me.

178
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:21,837
- My game, my girl...
- What about you, huh?

179
00:14:22,190 --> 00:14:25,769
I bet your grades sucked before you met me. But I didn't see you going to Haley for help then.

180
00:14:27,161 --> 00:14:29,333
Who said what me and Haley's got's is about grades.

181
00:14:29,414 --> 00:14:31,001
Ravens! Hey Ravens!

182
00:14:33,542 --> 00:14:34,354
Want a ride?

183
00:14:36,157 --> 00:14:37,888
I wouldn't take that ride if I was you.

184
00:14:38,773 --> 00:14:39,730
You're not me.

185
00:14:40,453 --> 00:14:41,502
You never will be.

186
00:14:52,485 --> 00:14:54,620
Two little Ravens for the price of one.

187
00:14:54,876 --> 00:14:57,200
Get in or the superstar dies.

188
00:15:15,306 --> 00:15:16,708
What are you still doing here?

189
00:15:16,893 --> 00:15:18,253
I'm thinking of transferring.

190
00:15:19,458 --> 00:15:20,439
What's your excuse?

191
00:15:20,732 --> 00:15:22,623
Brooke. She's been in there forever.

192
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,254
Peyton!

193
00:15:26,697 --> 00:15:27,921
Oh boy.

194
00:15:29,181 --> 00:15:29,975
Hi.

195
00:15:30,553 --> 00:15:33,159
This is my best friend in the whole wide world. Don't you think she's pretty?

196
00:15:33,210 --> 00:15:33,952
What is this?

197
00:15:34,290 --> 00:15:36,974
She found some pills... on the floor.

198
00:15:37,225 --> 00:15:39,742
She'll be fine. Just uh, let her sleep it off.

199
00:15:41,954 --> 00:15:43,768
Hey! Ooh, call me!

200
00:15:48,697 --> 00:15:52,159
We  should totally hang out more. What is your name?

201
00:15:52,568 --> 00:15:53,567
Haley...

202
00:15:54,822 --> 00:15:59,194
Yeah. I don't like that name. Lets call you... Brooke!

203
00:15:59,742 --> 00:16:00,704
Hi friend!

204
00:16:03,357 --> 00:16:04,348
Thanks.

205
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,435
Sure. I'll see you guys later.

206
00:16:06,987 --> 00:16:09,757
- Where's your ride?
- Oh. I'm going to take the last fan bus back.

207
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:11,435
It just left.

208
00:16:11,549 --> 00:16:14,083
That's perfect. Brookie can come with us!

209
00:16:14,663 --> 00:16:16,357
Yeah, she named me Brooke.

210
00:16:16,694 --> 00:16:21,452
Peyton, can she come? Please? Peyton, please!

211
00:16:21,543 --> 00:16:24,800
Just don't touch the stereo. Or we'll have a problem.

212
00:16:26,581 --> 00:16:27,697
Road trip.

213
00:16:28,747 --> 00:16:32,822
We're going on a road trip. We're going on a road trip.

214
00:16:43,119 --> 00:16:45,648
Alright. This is my stop. Thanks for the ride, fellas.

215
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:48,951
This one's funny, Thing. Lets kill him last.

216
00:16:50,743 --> 00:16:52,464
Wait. Your name is Thing?

217
00:16:52,643 --> 00:16:54,466
That's right. Thing.

218
00:16:54,589 --> 00:16:56,048
And I'm Thing One.

219
00:16:56,380 --> 00:16:57,686
Okay, wait. Let me guess.

220
00:16:58,705 --> 00:16:59,769
Thing Two.

221
00:17:00,226 --> 00:17:02,401
Thing Three. Because I'm the third.

222
00:17:05,519 --> 00:17:07,215
Whoa. Dude...

223
00:17:07,389 --> 00:17:10,245
Get your clothes off, boys. You're going shopping.

224
00:17:20,705 --> 00:17:23,281
Oh, what do you know? We finally got the center aisle this year.

225
00:17:24,393 --> 00:17:26,394
Guy must've thought I said Dan Scott.

226
00:17:26,548 --> 00:17:30,675
No. Dan's table has one spot for Dan and five for his ego.

227
00:17:33,368 --> 00:17:36,895
Well, well, well. Isn't this cozy?

228
00:17:37,776 --> 00:17:38,616
Hey Karen.

229
00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:39,952
Hi.

230
00:17:41,058 --> 00:17:42,040
Hi Deb...

231
00:17:42,896 --> 00:17:43,879
Dan.

232
00:17:58,379 --> 00:18:01,389
- Hemorrhoid ointment.
- Dude, this is total crap.

233
00:18:01,681 --> 00:18:05,095
These guys are morons, not killers. I bet it's not even a real gun.

234
00:18:05,398 --> 00:18:08,378
Lets just play the game, get our clothes, and get home.

235
00:18:09,694 --> 00:18:14,103
Okay. Ah, we need two bottles of spring feminine cleansers.

236
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:19,352
Oh, great. A pair of douche bags.

237
00:18:20,386 --> 00:18:21,799
A case of beer and we're out of here.

238
00:18:22,111 --> 00:18:24,225
What? How are we going to pull that off?

239
00:18:24,508 --> 00:18:25,587
Would you card us?

240
00:18:27,471 --> 00:18:28,402
I didn't think so.

241
00:18:34,854 --> 00:18:36,886
Brooke! Come on...

242
00:18:45,012 --> 00:18:49,907
Don't you two like the same guys? Or guy, or something?

243
00:18:50,558 --> 00:18:52,569
I'm just tutoring him, that's all.

244
00:18:54,694 --> 00:18:58,104
So you're not into him? Because he seems to be into you.

245
00:18:58,196 --> 00:18:59,497
He gave her the nod!

246
00:19:00,683 --> 00:19:02,303
Just be careful.

247
00:19:04,873 --> 00:19:08,574
- Well, what about you and Lucas?
- What about us?

248
00:19:08,810 --> 00:19:13,347
Oh, come on. Tortured artist meets tortured athlete? Talk about your obvious attraction.

249
00:19:17,418 --> 00:19:19,772
- I hear birds.
- Unbelievable!

250
00:19:19,844 --> 00:19:22,328
Brooke, did you not think to put gas in the car?

251
00:19:25,916 --> 00:19:27,545
Answer the question, Brooke.

252
00:19:29,434 --> 00:19:30,607
Why are we stopping?

253
00:19:39,383 --> 00:19:41,513
- Sweet. They scored the brew.
- Where's the porn?

254
00:19:41,686 --> 00:19:44,584
Hey. You had your fun. Now give us back our clothes.

255
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:48,031
Yeah, man, I'm done with these clowns. Hey, lets go somewhere and get wasted.

256
00:19:48,113 --> 00:19:50,605
- With no porno mags?
- They didn't have Playgirl.

257
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:54,159
- Go back inside and get some hardcore.
- Wait! Shut up! Listen!

258
00:19:56,821 --> 00:19:58,429
- Come on, roll, roll, roll.
- Go, roll!

259
00:19:59,545 --> 00:20:01,092
Come on, lets go, lets go, lets go.

260
00:20:01,634 --> 00:20:03,359
Move it! Come on! Lets go!

261
00:20:17,215 --> 00:20:21,187
- Oh, yeah. Yeah, baby!
- Yeah, yeah, right. Alright. Yahoo!

262
00:20:21,249 --> 00:20:23,154
Yeah, enough's enough. Give us our clothes.

263
00:20:23,650 --> 00:20:25,692
Don't they say please in the suburbs?

264
00:20:26,175 --> 00:20:28,376
He said give us our clothes, you hick.

265
00:20:30,291 --> 00:20:33,286
- Can't you steal a fake gun in the suburbs?
- That's great. It's a starter pistol.

266
00:20:33,977 --> 00:20:36,712
- I knew this thing was fake.
- Yeah, but our fists are real.

267
00:20:37,244 --> 00:20:41,617
Look. We'll give you guys your clothes back. We'll even give one of you a ride home.

268
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:44,130
Yeah. What do you mean by one of us?

269
00:20:46,725 --> 00:20:48,390
The game is Gladiator.

270
00:20:48,626 --> 00:20:51,841
Basically, you guys beat the hell out of each other for our amusement.

271
00:20:52,353 --> 00:20:55,317
The one left standing gets his clothes and a ride to a phone.

272
00:20:55,763 --> 00:20:58,692
The loser... well he loses.

273
00:20:58,954 --> 00:21:00,315
Let the games begin.

274
00:21:07,057 --> 00:21:11,989
Okay, the game isn't called two punks staring at each other.

275
00:21:12,116 --> 00:21:14,912
It's called Gladiator. Get to it.

276
00:21:15,450 --> 00:21:19,621
Alright, you can screw yourself. Because there's no way in hell that the two of us are going to fight.

277
00:21:22,491 --> 00:21:23,473
Or maybe we are.

278
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,628
This is great. Not only do I get to kick your ass but you get 30 miles to think about it.

279
00:21:42,571 --> 00:21:44,547
What the hell are you doing, man? We should be fighting them.

280
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:46,283
- You want it?
- Yeah.

281
00:21:50,789 --> 00:21:51,910
Wait, wait, wait!

282
00:21:54,697 --> 00:21:55,535
You okay?

283
00:21:56,463 --> 00:21:57,240
Yeah.

284
00:21:58,064 --> 00:21:59,549
Pickerington morons.

285
00:21:59,779 --> 00:22:01,377
- Give us the keys.
- Give us our clothes.

286
00:22:03,968 --> 00:22:04,755
Fine.

287
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:10,002
You guys wanna play games, huh? I've got a little game for you.

288
00:22:10,219 --> 00:22:14,888
It's called keys for clothes. You give us a piece of our clothes, we'll give you a key.

289
00:22:15,007 --> 00:22:17,059
- No deal.
- Fine. We were walking anyways.

290
00:22:17,268 --> 00:22:19,057
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
- We'll deal.

291
00:22:19,333 --> 00:22:22,235
- Forget it. I want to walk home.
- It's dark.

292
00:22:22,329 --> 00:22:23,327
Man, seriously.

293
00:22:24,039 --> 00:22:26,271
Fine. Give him his sweats.

294
00:22:28,851 --> 00:22:31,724
- That's worth a house key.
- Hey, keep them coming.

295
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:39,844
There's still no signal. Who lives like this?

296
00:22:40,029 --> 00:22:41,160
Pop the trunk, will you?

297
00:22:42,046 --> 00:22:44,231
Peyton, don't listen to it. It might be a trick.

298
00:22:45,077 --> 00:22:46,224
Yeah, it's empty.

299
00:22:46,890 --> 00:22:51,021
I saw a gas station a few miles back. If I'm not back in an hour, tell my mom I loved her?

300
00:22:51,759 --> 00:22:54,538
-  Don't you mean Nathan?
- I'll go with you.

301
00:22:55,685 --> 00:22:56,612
What about me?

302
00:22:58,664 --> 00:23:00,856
I could suffocate in here.

303
00:23:01,573 --> 00:23:03,308
- Guys!
- You did crack a window, right?

304
00:23:05,219 --> 00:23:11,353
Come on! I'm scared! Please! Come on, you guys.

305
00:23:11,742 --> 00:23:13,493
Don't go! Someone will come!

306
00:23:15,752 --> 00:23:19,688
Scott Motor Company's been reaching a lead in new car sales for the past six years.

307
00:23:19,873 --> 00:23:22,233
Pretty soon we'll be the top dealership in North Carolina.

308
00:23:23,236 --> 00:23:24,711
So you two are in business together?

309
00:23:24,859 --> 00:23:29,483
Uh, no. I own the company. Keith runs a garage.

310
00:23:29,585 --> 00:23:31,014
I fix the junk that he sells.

311
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:34,275
Alright. Lets give credit where credit's due.

312
00:23:35,699 --> 00:23:40,060
Big brother here has been tinking with cars for years. If it wasn't for his influence and...

313
00:23:40,952 --> 00:23:44,507
lack of initiative, I may never have been able to realize my dream.

314
00:23:44,926 --> 00:23:48,361
Hmm. Was it really my influence, Dan?

315
00:23:48,995 --> 00:23:52,609
Because I thought it was Deb's money that bankrolled your dream.

316
00:23:53,799 --> 00:23:57,137
True. Deb's father took a leap of faith with me.

317
00:23:57,807 --> 00:24:00,296
Of course, I returned his investment ten-fold.

318
00:24:00,434 --> 00:24:03,854
And every good business man knows it's a long road from seed money...

319
00:24:04,259 --> 00:24:06,515
- To profit.
- To profits, exactly.

320
00:24:06,593 --> 00:24:07,521
Amen to that.

321
00:24:08,678 --> 00:24:13,320
So Keith. You talk about being a self-made man but... self-made into what?

322
00:24:14,278 --> 00:24:15,134
Excuse me.

323
00:24:25,712 --> 00:24:28,763
Last key. You got one thing left.

324
00:24:28,902 --> 00:24:31,087
Give us the car key and we'll give you the shirt.

325
00:24:31,379 --> 00:24:32,582
I can live without my shirt.

326
00:24:33,466 --> 00:24:36,510
- Oh man, no!
- Have fun walking.

327
00:24:38,557 --> 00:24:41,895
Just find the key... we're gonna kill those guys.

328
00:24:45,899 --> 00:24:47,154
What did you mean before?

329
00:24:47,983 --> 00:24:50,472
About Nathan when you said be careful?

330
00:24:51,077 --> 00:24:53,416
I just know him, that's all.

331
00:24:53,965 --> 00:24:55,310
Said the ex-girlfriend.

332
00:24:56,638 --> 00:24:59,285
Look, we were crazy with drama but I'm over it.

333
00:25:00,917 --> 00:25:04,752
He's not a complete waste. He just- he's really threatened by Lucas.

334
00:25:05,381 --> 00:25:08,097
It could all just be a big mind game. That's how he works.

335
00:25:09,130 --> 00:25:10,292
Do you like him?

336
00:25:10,927 --> 00:25:13,993
I was- talk about stuff, you know what I mean?

337
00:25:14,317 --> 00:25:17,456
- Like what?
- Like school or... his dad.

338
00:25:17,512 --> 00:25:21,638
Oh. Dan. Danny sure did a number on his boy, right?

339
00:25:22,273 --> 00:25:23,557
Yeah. Both of them.

340
00:25:25,519 --> 00:25:27,322
So you didn't answer my question.

341
00:25:28,145 --> 00:25:29,134
Do you like him?

342
00:25:30,332 --> 00:25:35,349
It doesn't matter. I mean, that... it would be too weird around Lucas.

343
00:25:36,178 --> 00:25:39,777
That's his problem. You've got a life to live too.

344
00:25:39,865 --> 00:25:41,283
It just seems kind of selfish.

345
00:25:41,795 --> 00:25:44,811
Why? Did he ask you if he could go out with me?

346
00:25:46,802 --> 00:25:48,160
Did he ask you out?

347
00:25:49,036 --> 00:25:49,792
No.

348
00:25:50,581 --> 00:25:54,103
That's not the point. No. He wouldn't ask permission. So why should you?

349
00:25:55,450 --> 00:25:57,207
Would you say yes if he asked you out?

350
00:25:59,454 --> 00:26:00,622
It depends.

351
00:26:01,078 --> 00:26:04,513
What song is playing... am I in a mood...

352
00:26:04,571 --> 00:26:08,521
is he smiling when he asks or is he doing that goofy brooding thing he does?

353
00:26:08,610 --> 00:26:11,288
Oh, you know I think he's definitely doing the broody thing.

354
00:26:11,348 --> 00:26:12,711
He does that all the time!

355
00:26:13,995 --> 00:26:16,111
It's strange. Just...

356
00:26:17,763 --> 00:26:21,409
the night away from school. It feels like you and I actually live on the same planet.

357
00:26:22,596 --> 00:26:24,486
Life plays trick on you like that.

358
00:26:36,123 --> 00:26:39,324
Can I bankroll another drink for you?

359
00:26:39,427 --> 00:26:40,533
I'm sorry about that.

360
00:26:40,973 --> 00:26:43,990
I shouldn't have dragged you into it.

361
00:26:45,458 --> 00:26:48,044
Sometimes my little brother has a way of getting to me...

362
00:26:48,141 --> 00:26:50,517
- He has a gift.
- Yeah.

363
00:26:51,988 --> 00:26:57,869
You know, you and Karen really go nicely together.

364
00:27:00,224 --> 00:27:02,436
I don't think she sees me that way.

365
00:27:02,687 --> 00:27:04,526
How do you see her?

366
00:27:07,346 --> 00:27:11,105
She's amazing. She's strong, she's beautiful,

367
00:27:13,239 --> 00:27:15,769
and, you know, she's a great mother to Lucas.

368
00:27:18,171 --> 00:27:22,574
- So...
- A relationship would just complicate things.

369
00:27:25,138 --> 00:27:26,373
What about you, Deb?

370
00:27:27,442 --> 00:27:29,507
Tonight was just part of the course with him.

371
00:27:31,095 --> 00:27:33,893
And, I know it's none of my business but why are you...

372
00:27:35,256 --> 00:27:36,770
Why do I stay with him.

373
00:27:37,528 --> 00:27:38,235
Yeah...

374
00:27:39,598 --> 00:27:40,551
It's okay.

375
00:27:42,711 --> 00:27:49,541
Believe it or not, some days he's the man I fell in love with and other days...

376
00:27:52,515 --> 00:27:53,555
I don't know.

377
00:27:55,541 --> 00:27:59,801
Besides, if you've got Lucas to consider, I've certainly got Nathan.

378
00:28:01,199 --> 00:28:03,636
Come on. Lets go rescue Karen.

379
00:28:05,910 --> 00:28:06,734
Yeah.

380
00:28:11,570 --> 00:28:15,551
- Alright, it's a blue key chain.
- Dude, look over here moron. Is that blue?

381
00:28:15,683 --> 00:28:17,047
Are you color blind?

382
00:28:17,378 --> 00:28:22,196
- I can't believe you sucker punched me.
- I had to. It got us outta there, didn't it?

383
00:28:29,856 --> 00:28:30,608
Here.

384
00:28:32,576 --> 00:28:36,860
So what's your master plan, genius? Huh? You gonna hotwire the car?

385
00:28:37,823 --> 00:28:39,251
Actually, we're not gonna have to.

386
00:28:40,449 --> 00:28:44,290
Those idiots are gonna flip out when they find a key chain with no car key.

387
00:28:54,304 --> 00:28:57,560
- Great! 
- And no phone. What are we going to do?

388
00:28:59,424 --> 00:29:03,449
So we'll get the car, we'll drive into town, we'll find a phone, and we'll ditch it.

389
00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:06,122
Wait, what if they report it stolen?

390
00:29:06,638 --> 00:29:09,542
Well I kinda think that the cops got the license plate number earlier, don't you?

391
00:29:09,608 --> 00:29:11,242
Yes, but they didn't see who was driving that car.

392
00:29:11,318 --> 00:29:15,189
I mean, think about it, if they pull us over they can pin everything on us.

393
00:29:15,292 --> 00:29:17,513
What if we sit here and we talk about it all night, huh?

394
00:29:18,088 --> 00:29:19,402
Got any better ideas?

395
00:29:20,688 --> 00:29:22,833
- I'll drive.
- No. I'll drive.

396
00:29:32,967 --> 00:29:33,785
Whoa, whoa!

397
00:29:35,112 --> 00:29:36,720
Pickerington sucks!

398
00:29:41,362 --> 00:29:47,656
Oh yeah, oh! They aren't going anywhere. Lets go get them, boys!

399
00:29:49,091 --> 00:29:50,253
- Bail.
- Bail!

400
00:29:52,535 --> 00:29:55,848
- We're gonna pluck you, Ravens!
- Hey, I've still got your shirt!

401
00:29:55,898 --> 00:29:59,436
Shut up! They can run but they can't hide!

402
00:30:03,492 --> 00:30:05,592
- Oh yes!
- So what are you doing?

403
00:30:06,119 --> 00:30:08,632
Um...here, hold this.

404
00:30:10,865 --> 00:30:14,157
- Or you'll stab me?
- A girl can't be too safe.

405
00:30:14,966 --> 00:30:17,182
Here, try and get that gas cap open, will you?

406
00:30:17,490 --> 00:30:20,720
- Does this really work?
- We are about to find out.

407
00:30:26,661 --> 00:30:27,940
Had a lot of practice?

408
00:30:29,339 --> 00:30:31,232
At sucking gas. What did you think I meant?

409
00:30:31,283 --> 00:30:32,136
You wanna do it?

410
00:30:33,572 --> 00:30:34,996
Watch out for the golf ball.

411
00:30:38,595 --> 00:30:40,264
- Oh, yeah.
- Are you kidding?

412
00:30:41,226 --> 00:30:43,751
Dude, who knew you were like the 4th Charlie's Angel?

413
00:30:49,007 --> 00:30:53,214
Oh Ravens! Come out and play

414
00:30:54,598 --> 00:30:55,681
Still out there.

415
00:30:56,624 --> 00:30:58,189
They'll get bored eventually.

416
00:31:04,447 --> 00:31:06,593
So that was a pretty good move with the car keys.

417
00:31:07,820 --> 00:31:12,665
Yeah. It doesn't change the fact that my dad's gonna kill me for getting kicked out of that game.

418
00:31:16,430 --> 00:31:18,645
You should consider yourself lucky sometimes.

419
00:31:19,847 --> 00:31:21,348
Lucking out of a dad?

420
00:31:22,495 --> 00:31:23,637
At least this one.

421
00:31:28,164 --> 00:31:30,882
I remember this one summer, I was playing little league baseball

422
00:31:31,362 --> 00:31:33,878
and I was the pitcher and my dad was the coach.

423
00:31:34,563 --> 00:31:37,057
Anyway, this kid Billy Lyons, he was a great hitter.

424
00:31:38,270 --> 00:31:39,892
Everything he hit was a homerun.

425
00:31:40,538 --> 00:31:45,345
So, you know, he got up to the plate and there was nobody on base so I just walked him.

426
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:48,064
Four straight pitches, nothing even close to a strike.

427
00:31:49,553 --> 00:31:54,351
So my dad calls a timeout, comes to the mound, and I'm thinking he's gonna say

428
00:31:54,399 --> 00:31:57,875
like, Smart move or Good thinking son, something like that.

429
00:31:59,452 --> 00:32:04,617
But instead... instead he grabs me by the arm,

430
00:32:05,273 --> 00:32:07,566
and he kicks me in the ass as hard as he can.

431
00:32:08,601 --> 00:32:12,041
I mean, he literally took me by the arm so that I wouldn't like, go flying,

432
00:32:12,087 --> 00:32:13,409
he kicked me so hard.

433
00:32:15,723 --> 00:32:18,785
Then he brought Stevie Planking into pitch, sat me on the bench,

434
00:32:19,137 --> 00:32:20,443
never mentioned it again.

435
00:32:21,431 --> 00:32:23,275
- That sucks.
- Yeah.

436
00:32:27,126 --> 00:32:30,468
So just think about that the next time you're feeling sorry for yourself.

437
00:32:38,241 --> 00:32:40,412
I haven't heard from you, Nathan. I'm starting to get nervous.

438
00:32:40,627 --> 00:32:44,051
Uh... just call and leave your stats on my phone as soon as you get this.

439
00:32:45,206 --> 00:32:46,239
You okay?

440
00:32:47,191 --> 00:32:51,261
- Yup. Just a little bit hammered.
- Sorry, Karen. It was my fault.

441
00:32:52,822 --> 00:32:53,663
What?

442
00:32:54,656 --> 00:32:56,764
I thought we said no basketball.

443
00:32:57,189 --> 00:33:00,318
What do you want from me, Deb? You leave me here with Karen and these two?

444
00:33:04,686 --> 00:33:05,792
How you doing, boozy?

445
00:33:07,154 --> 00:33:09,477
Alright, you know what? I'm ready to go.

446
00:33:10,107 --> 00:33:12,878
Oh, there, see. Your ride's leaving.

447
00:33:13,543 --> 00:33:16,580
I mean, she may not be much of a date but at least she's a reliable designated driver.

448
00:33:16,722 --> 00:33:18,162
Dan, that's enough.

449
00:33:18,222 --> 00:33:21,402
You know, maybe you oughtta spend a little less time

450
00:33:22,641 --> 00:33:27,683
worrying about my relationship and a little more time paying attention to your own.

451
00:33:30,445 --> 00:33:33,384
If you call chasing after my leftovers a relationship.

452
00:33:35,464 --> 00:33:40,368
- Keith! Keith! It's not worth it.
- Come on!

453
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:45,565
Keith! Come on, come on. Please? Lets just go, alright?

454
00:33:45,734 --> 00:33:48,611
Okay, I'm fine.

455
00:33:48,704 --> 00:33:51,037
- It was a joke.
- Come on, please.

456
00:34:20,391 --> 00:34:22,556
Man, it's been like, what? Twenty minutes?

457
00:34:23,331 --> 00:34:24,476
Think they're coming back?

458
00:34:27,734 --> 00:34:28,487
What?

459
00:34:28,871 --> 00:34:31,462
Thing, Thing One, and Thing Three.

460
00:34:35,717 --> 00:34:38,092
Well, yeah man, he was the third.

461
00:34:38,321 --> 00:34:39,092
Yeah.

462
00:34:43,534 --> 00:34:47,288
Hey. What are we doing hiding from these idiots anyway, huh?

463
00:34:48,163 --> 00:34:49,437
Look, I can hold my own.

464
00:34:50,278 --> 00:34:53,083
And I know that you could throw a pretty damn good punch.

465
00:34:55,265 --> 00:34:56,738
I say lets take these fools on.

466
00:34:57,824 --> 00:34:59,626
Alright. I'm in for that.

467
00:35:11,085 --> 00:35:12,600
Are you gonna stay down here all night?

468
00:35:13,926 --> 00:35:14,730
I made a call.

469
00:35:17,373 --> 00:35:20,374
Nathan got thrown out of the game tonight for fighting with Lucas.

470
00:35:22,067 --> 00:35:23,516
Fighting with his brother.

471
00:35:23,885 --> 00:35:26,271
Hmm. I wonder where he gets that from?

472
00:35:27,341 --> 00:35:29,871
His phone's turned off. No one's answering at home.

473
00:35:30,066 --> 00:35:31,038
But he's okay?

474
00:35:35,011 --> 00:35:36,602
I'm sorry about tonight, Deb.

475
00:35:37,484 --> 00:35:42,619
- I don't know how things got so out of hand.
- Things didn't get out of hand, Dan. You did.

476
00:35:42,675 --> 00:35:44,939
- He threw the first punch.
- You provoked him.

477
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:50,315
Nathan's prospects took a huge blow tonight. Can we just focus on him?

478
00:35:53,449 --> 00:35:55,603
That's the wrong answer, Dan.

479
00:35:57,636 --> 00:36:01,795
And if you don't know that, I'm not sure I know you anymore.

480
00:36:03,168 --> 00:36:04,852
Well that's a two way street.

481
00:36:06,408 --> 00:36:08,272
I'm gonna go upstairs and pack.

482
00:36:09,397 --> 00:36:10,575
We should go home.

483
00:36:32,826 --> 00:36:34,444
He cares about you, you know?

484
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:38,053
Yeah.

485
00:36:42,126 --> 00:36:43,343
We need some music.

486
00:36:45,231 --> 00:36:46,118
Peyton!

487
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:50,199
Sorry...

488
00:36:51,135 --> 00:36:52,334
Where the hell are we?

489
00:36:53,132 --> 00:36:54,806
Miles from normal.

490
00:37:00,035 --> 00:37:01,407
What is she doing here?

491
00:37:02,855 --> 00:37:04,263
You invited her!

492
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:10,679
Ow!

493
00:37:15,779 --> 00:37:18,436
I cannot believe I let him get to me.

494
00:37:18,757 --> 00:37:20,228
So did I.

495
00:37:21,175 --> 00:37:24,196
I guess we both should know better by now.

496
00:37:24,882 --> 00:37:26,173
Yeah, but even so...

497
00:37:27,755 --> 00:37:30,151
you should be able to count on me.

498
00:37:30,857 --> 00:37:36,321
It's like I can see the guy that I am in my head and I can see the guy that I want to be

499
00:37:37,267 --> 00:37:40,575
and they're just... it's not the same.

500
00:37:40,903 --> 00:37:42,341
That's okay, Keith.

501
00:37:43,494 --> 00:37:44,978
I like who you are.

502
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:51,342
And I do count on you. More than you know.

503
00:37:56,171 --> 00:37:57,353
Can I tell you a secret?

504
00:37:58,281 --> 00:37:59,022
Sure.

505
00:38:02,407 --> 00:38:06,089
Lucas called tonight a date for us.

506
00:38:08,638 --> 00:38:12,340
And for a while, I pretended that it was.

507
00:38:14,476 --> 00:38:15,750
And it felt good.

508
00:38:18,603 --> 00:38:20,118
Can I tell you a secret?

509
00:38:21,131 --> 00:38:22,800
Sure. Go ahead.

510
00:38:24,101 --> 00:38:25,868
I pretended that too.

511
00:38:33,845 --> 00:38:34,992
I love you.

512
00:38:37,629 --> 00:38:38,719
Always have.

513
00:39:03,503 --> 00:39:04,913
Nice. What's next?

514
00:39:05,364 --> 00:39:07,868
- Uh, you pick.
- Alright.

515
00:39:11,384 --> 00:39:15,394
This is so tragic. You two don't actually think you're going to be friends tomorrow, do you?

516
00:39:24,498 --> 00:39:25,896
So this Haley thing...

517
00:39:27,551 --> 00:39:30,181
you know, for some reason she feels like you're not full of crap.

518
00:39:30,622 --> 00:39:33,134
- Don't take advantage of that.
- I'm not going to.

519
00:39:33,421 --> 00:39:36,879
I know you're not. Because if you do, you're going to live to regret it.

520
00:39:37,037 --> 00:39:37,917
Bring it on.

521
00:39:41,025 --> 00:39:42,219
Hey, listen.

522
00:39:44,001 --> 00:39:47,231
Look, man, you didn't have to get in that car when those guys grabbed me.

523
00:39:47,824 --> 00:39:50,159
Especially after you warned me not to.

524
00:39:50,631 --> 00:39:51,464
Right, whatever.

525
00:39:52,678 --> 00:39:56,262
You know the way I see it, I mean, if they would've taken you out,

526
00:39:56,304 --> 00:39:58,014
who the hell else am I gonna have to fight with, right?

527
00:39:59,253 --> 00:40:00,471
Same person I have.

528
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:11,039
Car.

529
00:40:14,562 --> 00:40:15,746
- You ready?
- Yeah.

530
00:40:17,311 --> 00:40:18,146
Lets do it.

531
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:33,903
Haley and Peyton.

532
00:40:36,727 --> 00:40:39,958
Oh my Gosh. Nathan with Lucas?

533
00:40:52,006 --> 00:40:54,643
As happens sometimes a moment settled...

534
00:40:58,885 --> 00:41:00,669
and hovered and remained...

535
00:41:04,324 --> 00:41:06,049
for much more than a moment.

536
00:41:09,864 --> 00:41:11,046
And sound stopped...

537
00:41:12,910 --> 00:41:14,160
and movement stopped...

538
00:41:16,704 --> 00:41:18,644
for much, much more than a moment.

539
00:41:23,433 --> 00:41:25,747
And then the moment was gone.

540
