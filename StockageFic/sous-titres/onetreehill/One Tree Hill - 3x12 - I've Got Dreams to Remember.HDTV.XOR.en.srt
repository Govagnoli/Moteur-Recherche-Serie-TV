1
00:00:00,593 --> 00:00:02,162
Previously on "One Tree Hill"...

2
00:00:02,368 --> 00:00:04,640
If you are gonna help me with Haley's record,

3
00:00:04,721 --> 00:00:06,879
you could maybe move into the house with me.

4
00:00:06,965 --> 00:00:08,511
It's a business arrangement.

5
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:09,471
Of course.

6
00:00:09,564 --> 00:00:12,368
With me tonight is my new color announcer, Gigi Silveri.

7
00:00:12,457 --> 00:00:14,230
You really expect us to practice in this dump?

8
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:15,682
Not only practice.

9
00:00:15,786 --> 00:00:19,488
Till further notice, you're gonna play all your games in here.

10
00:00:20,585 --> 00:00:23,881
If you tell Whitey I have a heart condition, I'm off the team.

11
00:00:23,952 --> 00:00:27,433
Yeah, and if I don't tell Whitey about your heart condition, you're off the planet.

12
00:00:27,532 --> 00:00:29,778
It was you, wasn't it? The dress I designed --

13
00:00:29,914 --> 00:00:32,031
the one you made -- it got me into Rogue Vogue.

14
00:00:32,133 --> 00:00:35,078
Your clothes are good, but if you're afraid to go --

15
00:00:35,164 --> 00:00:36,415
Oh, no, I'm gonna go,

16
00:00:36,801 --> 00:00:37,865
and I'm gonna win.

17
00:00:38,397 --> 00:00:41,361
Did you think about it -- having a baby to stay together?

18
00:00:41,471 --> 00:00:42,739
Let me see the pills.

19
00:00:43,115 --> 00:00:45,077
I cannot believe you still don't believe me.

20
00:00:45,602 --> 00:00:46,282
Here.

21
00:00:47,723 --> 00:00:49,590
Take them. I don't need them anymore.

22
00:00:49,738 --> 00:00:50,502
Haley!

23
00:00:50,664 --> 00:00:53,152
Your future as a basketball player is totally secure.

24
00:00:53,244 --> 00:00:55,324
Your future as my husband -- not so much.

25
00:00:56,624 --> 00:00:59,639
You know, I thought about you every day I was gone,

26
00:00:59,716 --> 00:01:02,393
and you're even prettier than I remembered.

27
00:01:02,684 --> 00:01:04,894
Keith Scott? Put your hands behind your head.

28
00:01:04,946 --> 00:01:06,036
What the hell is this?

29
00:01:06,255 --> 00:01:09,004
You're under arrest for the attempted murder of Dan Scott.

30
00:01:53,336 --> 00:01:55,105
You're next. Haley?

31
00:01:56,590 --> 00:01:57,327
You're next.

32
00:02:03,956 --> 00:02:06,644
So, have you given any thought to which college you'd like to attend?

33
00:02:06,733 --> 00:02:09,178
Yeah, actually. I've been looking at Stanford.

34
00:02:12,589 --> 00:02:13,705
Oh, you're serious.

35
00:02:14,284 --> 00:02:17,453
Well, Stanford may not be too realistic for you, Faily.

36
00:02:18,303 --> 00:02:19,121
Haley.

37
00:02:19,406 --> 00:02:20,139
What?

38
00:02:20,266 --> 00:02:23,199
I think you just called me "Faily." My name's Haley.

39
00:02:23,297 --> 00:02:24,133
My mistake.

40
00:02:24,316 --> 00:02:26,846
I must have thought that was your name because you failed every class.

41
00:02:26,938 --> 00:02:28,009
I didn't fail anything.

42
00:02:28,101 --> 00:02:29,793
No? What about your marriage?

43
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:33,497
Well... that is none of your business.

44
00:02:33,586 --> 00:02:35,221
Then there was the HCM test.

45
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:36,526
You failed that, too.

46
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,015
No, I didn't.

47
00:02:38,147 --> 00:02:39,849
Oh, that's right. You failed the friendship test

48
00:02:39,962 --> 00:02:42,658
by letting Lucas play basketball with a serious heart condition.

49
00:02:42,808 --> 00:02:43,956
Such a shame.

50
00:02:49,803 --> 00:02:50,486
Clear!

51
00:02:53,607 --> 00:02:55,777
Oh, he's 86'ed, yo.

52
00:02:56,945 --> 00:02:58,683
Just say, "he's dead," Tim.

53
00:03:03,462 --> 00:03:04,578
You're next.

54
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:08,763
Haley? Haley.

55
00:03:10,132 --> 00:03:11,055
You're next.

56
00:03:13,973 --> 00:03:16,893
So, have you given any thought to which college you'd like to attend?

57
00:03:18,479 --> 00:03:20,374
S-s-stanford.

58
00:03:22,079 --> 00:03:23,682
That's a great school for you.

59
00:03:25,464 --> 00:03:26,440
Are you okay?

60
00:03:26,885 --> 00:03:28,528
'Cause you seem a little sketchy.

61
00:03:28,681 --> 00:03:33,982
Me? No, no. Actually, I'm fine. I just love sleeping in jail cells.

62
00:03:35,459 --> 00:03:37,790
You understand that we have you on tape

63
00:03:38,328 --> 00:03:41,311
buying a bottle of liquor the day of the fire.

64
00:03:41,459 --> 00:03:44,036
I-I-I've seen it. It was stimulating.

65
00:03:45,004 --> 00:03:45,824
Yeah.

66
00:03:46,417 --> 00:03:48,390
We also know that you bought a gun.

67
00:03:48,511 --> 00:03:50,746
Oh, my god. Was Dan shot?

68
00:03:51,535 --> 00:03:52,441
Oh, wait.

69
00:03:52,793 --> 00:03:54,830
No, no, no. It was a fire. Yeah.

70
00:04:06,575 --> 00:04:07,557
It's gonna be fine.

71
00:04:08,252 --> 00:04:10,558
You need to get to school. I'll call you if I hear something.

72
00:04:10,682 --> 00:04:12,647
Come on, mom. It's Keith. This is important.

73
00:04:12,767 --> 00:04:14,692
Your future is important.

74
00:04:15,050 --> 00:04:18,311
Don't you have a meeting with your guidance counselor today to talk about colleges?

75
00:04:18,418 --> 00:04:20,095
Oh, you wouldn't want to miss that.

76
00:04:20,213 --> 00:04:22,367
Keith didn't go to college, and look where he ended up.

77
00:04:22,469 --> 00:04:24,111
What the hell is wrong with you?

78
00:04:24,216 --> 00:04:26,038
He's your brother, for God sake.

79
00:04:26,138 --> 00:04:29,417
Exactly. Someone should have told him that before he tried to light me on fire.

80
00:04:29,514 --> 00:04:30,741
Keith had nothing to do with that.

81
00:04:30,843 --> 00:04:32,593
How would you know? Were you there?

82
00:04:33,338 --> 00:04:35,312
Lucas, go to school.

83
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:37,114
Don't waste your breath on him.

84
00:04:37,241 --> 00:04:38,639
You wasted more than that.

85
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:40,109
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Now, come on.

86
00:04:40,201 --> 00:04:41,955
You don't want to get hurt before the big game tomorrow.

87
00:04:42,063 --> 00:04:43,390
There's  gonna be Scouts there.

88
00:04:43,494 --> 00:04:46,620
Oh, but then they're there to see Nathan, not you.

89
00:04:46,889 --> 00:04:49,493
Well, got to run. Don't want to be late for the Keith show.

90
00:04:50,065 --> 00:04:55,952
In today's episode, Keith Scott learns if you play with fire, you're gonna get burned.

91
00:04:57,518 --> 00:04:59,115
Sorry. Why am I here again?

92
00:04:59,352 --> 00:05:02,101
I mean, not that I'm not grateful for the "get out of jail free" card,

93
00:05:02,209 --> 00:05:03,968
but what's the catch?

94
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,856
You're here so I can help you decide which college is best for you.

95
00:05:06,986 --> 00:05:10,355
I doubt I'll even go to college, so you're wasting your breath.

96
00:05:10,463 --> 00:05:12,150
And you're wasting my time.

97
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:16,553
Why do you think your brother would accuse you of trying to kill him?

98
00:05:16,676 --> 00:05:19,537
Maybe he's still mad at me for sleeping with his wife.

99
00:05:19,659 --> 00:05:21,815
Is your wife gonna factor into the college you pick?

100
00:05:21,924 --> 00:05:23,782
That's not really your business, is it?

101
00:05:24,152 --> 00:05:26,266
Anyway, colleges come to me. I don't go to them.

102
00:05:26,382 --> 00:05:27,979
Then why'd you come back to Tree Hill?

103
00:05:28,074 --> 00:05:29,101
'Cause I live here.

104
00:05:29,207 --> 00:05:30,587
And do you want to stay close to home?

105
00:05:30,698 --> 00:05:31,675
Probably.

106
00:05:31,856 --> 00:05:34,515
I mean, I can't really afford to go to college out of state.

107
00:05:34,621 --> 00:05:36,966
Well, you're not going anywhere until we sort this out.

108
00:05:37,079 --> 00:05:38,020
Okay, okay.

109
00:05:38,147 --> 00:05:39,965
Stop, all right?

110
00:05:40,392 --> 00:05:41,827
I want to talk to my brother.

111
00:05:42,186 --> 00:05:45,390
I know he's out there. Come on, Danny! Come on in!

112
00:05:45,991 --> 00:05:47,124
Danny!

113
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,067
Ahh.

114
00:05:51,308 --> 00:05:52,765
You ready to confess?

115
00:05:54,308 --> 00:05:56,697
Yeah, okay. Okay.

116
00:05:57,141 --> 00:05:58,288
I confess.

117
00:05:58,726 --> 00:06:03,928
I bought a bottle of liquor. I was just so thirsty.

118
00:06:04,043 --> 00:06:06,127
I'm sorry, Dan. Can you forgive me?

119
00:06:06,315 --> 00:06:08,106
You think this is funny?

120
00:06:09,745 --> 00:06:12,027
Stop smiling, you son of a bitch!

121
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:14,442
Hey, there's no need to bring mom into this, Danny.

122
00:06:14,669 --> 00:06:15,822
Okay, that's enough.

123
00:06:16,233 --> 00:06:17,622
Wipe  that dumb smile off your face.

124
00:06:17,673 --> 00:06:18,772
That's enough, I said.

125
00:06:21,724 --> 00:06:23,133
Help. Police.

126
00:06:25,891 --> 00:06:29,225
Well, I guess I just don't really get the point of college.

127
00:06:29,335 --> 00:06:32,607
The point is to find something you love and hopefully make a career of it.

128
00:06:32,712 --> 00:06:33,878
What makes you happy?

129
00:06:35,439 --> 00:06:37,567
I don't know. Music, I guess.

130
00:06:37,763 --> 00:06:40,608
But everyone loves your stuff. You know that, right?

131
00:06:41,571 --> 00:06:44,869
I just think this would be a great opportunity for you.

132
00:06:46,665 --> 00:06:49,451
Okay. We'll talk later, then.

133
00:06:50,772 --> 00:06:52,896
Musicians can be so neurotic.

134
00:06:53,032 --> 00:06:54,571
No, that was Brooke.

135
00:06:54,644 --> 00:06:57,020
She's got this fashion-show thing coming up,

136
00:06:57,118 --> 00:06:59,571
so she calls me every second she has a new idea,

137
00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:02,010
which is pretty much every second.

138
00:07:02,474 --> 00:07:04,703
I didn't think I'd hear from her again now that her and Lucas

139
00:07:04,808 --> 00:07:07,140
have stopped this whole non-exclusive crap.

140
00:07:07,983 --> 00:07:09,904
Non-exclusive meaning?

141
00:07:10,576 --> 00:07:13,326
Basically, friends with benefits.

142
00:07:14,863 --> 00:07:17,007
Friends with benefits?

143
00:07:17,582 --> 00:07:19,343
Isn't that just sleeping around?

144
00:07:19,482 --> 00:07:23,683
No. It's like being friends with someone you get to have sex with,

145
00:07:23,772 --> 00:07:26,588
but you can still hook up with other people, too.

146
00:07:29,374 --> 00:07:32,771
Okay. So, you're right. It's the same.

147
00:07:36,702 --> 00:07:37,950
And what about you?

148
00:07:38,573 --> 00:07:40,853
Do you have any beneficial friends?

149
00:07:40,982 --> 00:07:41,863
No.

150
00:07:42,143 --> 00:07:44,177
I dated this guy Nathan for a while,

151
00:07:44,279 --> 00:07:46,737
but we were more benefits than we were friends.

152
00:07:47,696 --> 00:07:50,420
But we're just friends -- no benefits -- now.

153
00:07:50,529 --> 00:07:51,606
And then...

154
00:07:51,938 --> 00:07:53,797
there was this other guy, but --

155
00:07:54,163 --> 00:07:55,404
but he was more than that.

156
00:08:02,307 --> 00:08:03,482
Were you in love with him?

157
00:08:08,688 --> 00:08:09,853
That's the hard part.

158
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:11,836
Sex is easy.

159
00:08:12,569 --> 00:08:15,558
But if you find someone you're in love with who's also your friend,

160
00:08:15,697 --> 00:08:17,729
wouldn't that be the greatest benefit?

161
00:08:18,398 --> 00:08:20,555
Well, that's the fairy tale, I guess.

162
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,012
Well, there's nothing wrong with fairy tales.

163
00:08:23,827 --> 00:08:25,885
Everyone ends up happily ever after.

164
00:08:30,513 --> 00:08:34,500
When I was little, my parents took us to California so my sister could look at colleges,

165
00:08:34,593 --> 00:08:36,871
and Stanford was just one of our stops, and

166
00:08:36,981 --> 00:08:39,611
I was only 8, but I just fell in love.

167
00:08:39,802 --> 00:08:43,000
I'd never seen anything like it growing up in Tree Hill --

168
00:08:43,090 --> 00:08:46,975
all those different people in one place, and I just thought to myself,

169
00:08:47,274 --> 00:08:50,320
"wow, this must be what the world is like.

170
00:08:50,631 --> 00:08:52,341
This is where I want to be."

171
00:08:52,737 --> 00:08:55,433
And ever since then, I've just wanted to go there.

172
00:08:57,154 --> 00:08:58,760
Where  does your husband want to go?

173
00:09:00,497 --> 00:09:02,973
Hey, uh, this came to the apartment for you.

174
00:09:03,088 --> 00:09:04,487
I guess they think you still live there.

175
00:09:05,396 --> 00:09:06,207
Thanks.

176
00:09:06,668 --> 00:09:09,061
2,798 miles --

177
00:09:09,452 --> 00:09:11,559
that's how far apart our dream schools are.

178
00:09:11,777 --> 00:09:12,606
Yeah.

179
00:09:14,273 --> 00:09:16,496
Nathan, I said some things the other night --

180
00:09:16,596 --> 00:09:17,829
I said some things, too.

181
00:09:19,038 --> 00:09:20,094
I'm sorry.

182
00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:22,846
Me too.

183
00:09:25,574 --> 00:09:28,483
I guess we can add this to the list of things we should have talked about.

184
00:09:29,205 --> 00:09:30,655
We can talk about it now.

185
00:09:31,167 --> 00:09:34,304
I didn't realize I was supposed to figure out my entire future today.

186
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:36,770
You should at least be thinking about it.

187
00:09:36,903 --> 00:09:40,228
Trust me, I've been thinking about it ever since I could shoot a basketball.

188
00:09:42,052 --> 00:09:45,169
Look, Mayor Scott, the arrest was a favor,

189
00:09:45,308 --> 00:09:47,842
but without anything solid, I can't hold him.

190
00:09:48,035 --> 00:09:52,397
In fact, the only charges I could bring would be against you for assaulting your brother.

191
00:09:53,405 --> 00:09:54,739
Can I fire you?

192
00:09:55,518 --> 00:09:56,404
No.

193
00:09:57,399 --> 00:09:58,763
It's good seeing you, Danny.

194
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:03,690
Oh, uh, could this visit take the place of Christmas this year?

195
00:10:15,139 --> 00:10:17,104
Stanford is, like, my dream school.

196
00:10:17,193 --> 00:10:20,138
It's where I've wanted to go since I played pretend S.A.T's.

197
00:10:20,255 --> 00:10:21,875
Man, I forgot how much of a nerd you were.

198
00:10:21,988 --> 00:10:23,572
Oh, whatever, Rambo.

199
00:10:24,297 --> 00:10:26,253
Rambo was cool!

200
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:33,075
Oh, I don't feel like I'm picking a college as much as I feel like I'm picking a future.

201
00:10:33,186 --> 00:10:35,799
Yeah, but didn't you kind of pick a future when you married Nathan?

202
00:10:35,906 --> 00:10:37,542
Watch it, mister.

203
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:42,606
Hey, by the way, you're, um, like, feeling all right and everything, right?

204
00:10:42,709 --> 00:10:43,721
Yeah, I'm fine. Why?

205
00:10:43,882 --> 00:10:47,511
I just had this dream that you had a heart attack.

206
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:49,608
And you're buying your medicine and you don't need

207
00:10:49,689 --> 00:10:51,578
to borrow any money or anything, right?

208
00:10:51,703 --> 00:10:54,107
Yes, I'm fine, but thank you.

209
00:10:54,438 --> 00:10:56,294
What's up, boyfriend? Faily?

210
00:10:56,404 --> 00:10:58,370
And I'm never telling you anything again ever.

211
00:10:58,489 --> 00:11:00,715
Speaking of, though, what is the deal with these meetings today?

212
00:11:00,817 --> 00:11:02,774
College is like a million years away.

213
00:11:02,903 --> 00:11:04,375
Or 3,000 miles.

214
00:11:04,717 --> 00:11:05,616
Bye.

215
00:11:06,346 --> 00:11:07,600
Okay, I don't get it.

216
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:09,464
She just realized that she and Nathan want to go

217
00:11:09,564 --> 00:11:11,192
to college across the country from each other.

218
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:12,595
They just figured that out?

219
00:11:12,701 --> 00:11:15,279
Isn't that the sort of thing couples talk about?

220
00:11:15,416 --> 00:11:17,907
Yes. So...

221
00:11:18,204 --> 00:11:19,873
what are your plans after high school?

222
00:11:19,978 --> 00:11:22,528
Hmm. Well, I always figured I'd marry a millionaire

223
00:11:22,602 --> 00:11:25,502
and he'd whisk me away to his private island in the Bahamas.

224
00:11:26,169 --> 00:11:27,955
Where are you on that, anyway?

225
00:11:28,438 --> 00:11:30,915
How's the fashion institute's basketball team?

226
00:11:31,157 --> 00:11:35,053
Is there a good fashion program at, like, basketball school?

227
00:11:39,749 --> 00:11:43,110
Mouth, you're totally screwed.

228
00:11:43,324 --> 00:11:44,926
Principal  Turner wants to see you.

229
00:11:47,776 --> 00:11:51,171
I don't think I did anything wrong. I mean, did he say what he wants?

230
00:11:51,281 --> 00:11:53,540
No, because he didn't actually send me.

231
00:11:53,645 --> 00:11:54,903
I just need your help.

232
00:11:55,014 --> 00:11:57,366
But I had an appointment with the guidance counselor.

233
00:11:57,895 --> 00:12:01,134
Why would you let some burnout in a dead-end job tell you where to go to college?

234
00:12:01,235 --> 00:12:03,357
I mean, college obviously didn't work for her.

235
00:12:03,482 --> 00:12:05,893
Rachel, that burnout's my mom.

236
00:12:07,365 --> 00:12:10,369
See? I can joke, too. But seriously, I need to get back.

237
00:12:10,477 --> 00:12:14,638
But seriously, just catch the counselor on her lunch hour at the soup kitchen.

238
00:12:14,751 --> 00:12:15,575
I need your help.

239
00:12:16,297 --> 00:12:17,390
Marvin McFadden?

240
00:12:23,134 --> 00:12:24,077
Keith.

241
00:12:29,115 --> 00:12:30,160
Are you okay?

242
00:12:30,267 --> 00:12:31,710
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

243
00:12:31,897 --> 00:12:34,353
The Tree Hill jail isn't exactly Attica.

244
00:12:35,366 --> 00:12:37,036
You didn't have to wait for me.

245
00:12:38,581 --> 00:12:40,457
We can't let Dan get away with this.

246
00:12:40,718 --> 00:12:43,449
We should probably sue him or call the news or maybe even --

247
00:12:43,568 --> 00:12:44,482
Go out?

248
00:12:45,681 --> 00:12:48,380
The Ravens are playing tomorrow night, and

249
00:12:48,698 --> 00:12:50,755
I was thinking that maybe we should go together.

250
00:12:51,393 --> 00:12:53,366
You're asking me out on a date?

251
00:12:54,164 --> 00:12:56,982
Keith, Dan is trying to convict you of murder.

252
00:12:57,163 --> 00:12:58,959
I didn't kill anyone.

253
00:12:59,135 --> 00:13:00,971
Dan is just trying to rattle me.

254
00:13:01,729 --> 00:13:05,783
Besides, nothing would make me happier than taking you out.

255
00:13:06,631 --> 00:13:09,968
And nothing would make Dan angrier than seeing me happy.

256
00:13:10,212 --> 00:13:12,187
Well, okay, then. I'd love to.

257
00:13:12,393 --> 00:13:15,651
But, for the record, I'll be doing it for the first reason.

258
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:16,744
Okay.

259
00:13:17,796 --> 00:13:19,777
The  second reason will just be a bonus.

260
00:13:22,223 --> 00:13:24,180
So, you're interested in fashion design?

261
00:13:24,290 --> 00:13:27,201
Yes, but I'm interested in a lot of things.

262
00:13:27,317 --> 00:13:28,405
Such as?

263
00:13:28,616 --> 00:13:30,160
I'm student council president,

264
00:13:30,379 --> 00:13:32,981
captain of the cheerleaders, founder of "DWN not I",

265
00:13:33,077 --> 00:13:36,007
and girlfriend of Ravens' star shooting guard Lucas Scott.

266
00:13:36,378 --> 00:13:38,564
And what are your plans after high school?

267
00:13:39,242 --> 00:13:41,336
After high school, I have cheer practice.

268
00:13:44,297 --> 00:13:49,927
5, 6, 7, 8. Cross front, cross back, turn around, and pop!

269
00:13:50,027 --> 00:13:50,797
Back it up.

270
00:13:50,950 --> 00:13:53,024
Whoa! Stop! Halt! Cut!

271
00:13:53,133 --> 00:13:54,928
Why is everybody here early?

272
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:57,074
Early? You're like an hour late.

273
00:13:57,182 --> 00:14:00,710
I don't think so. Unlike you, I've never thought there was a 13:00.

274
00:14:00,821 --> 00:14:03,253
Brooke, Rachel said you wanted us here an hour early.

275
00:14:03,376 --> 00:14:06,594
And where did you two think I was this whole time?

276
00:14:06,714 --> 00:14:08,207
Late, as usual.

277
00:14:08,321 --> 00:14:11,453
Brooke, the classic's coming up, and we don't have a routine yet.

278
00:14:11,653 --> 00:14:14,618
I figured since Mouth helped you out last year,

279
00:14:14,728 --> 00:14:16,875
we could maybe come up with one and surprise you,

280
00:14:16,975 --> 00:14:18,897
so... surprise.

281
00:14:19,114 --> 00:14:22,844
The only way I'd be surprised right now is if you were actually wearing underwear.

282
00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:25,258
I guess no surprises, then.

283
00:14:26,077 --> 00:14:28,153
Okay. I am the captain of this squad.

284
00:14:28,251 --> 00:14:30,686
It is my job to come up with a routine for the tournament.

285
00:14:30,792 --> 00:14:33,317
The tournament's the same weekend as Rogue Vogue.

286
00:14:34,066 --> 00:14:35,848
You'll be in New York City.

287
00:14:37,993 --> 00:14:40,721
That's why you submitted my fashion designs.

288
00:14:41,241 --> 00:14:42,435
Surprise.

289
00:14:51,515 --> 00:14:55,673
I could probably get some academic-scholarship interest...

290
00:14:56,947 --> 00:14:59,292
but I'm really hoping to still play basketball.

291
00:15:01,963 --> 00:15:03,400
I guess I'm not ready to give it up.

292
00:15:04,363 --> 00:15:07,609
You know, in jail, a shot like that would make you somebody's girlfriend.

293
00:15:07,870 --> 00:15:09,349
Yeah, well, you'd know.

294
00:15:10,194 --> 00:15:11,637
I was worried about you. Are you okay?

295
00:15:11,737 --> 00:15:12,760
Yeah, I'm fine.

296
00:15:12,938 --> 00:15:15,242
Anyway, you're a kid, Lucas. You should worry about kid stuff.

297
00:15:15,370 --> 00:15:19,220
Oh, you mean like school, money, mom,

298
00:15:19,588 --> 00:15:21,915
college scholarships, Scouts?

299
00:15:22,059 --> 00:15:23,801
Wow, it's tough being a kid these days.

300
00:15:24,851 --> 00:15:26,930
Since when do you worry about Scouts?

301
00:15:27,097 --> 00:15:29,586
Since I realized if I get a basketball scholarship,

302
00:15:29,689 --> 00:15:31,485
my mom won't have to worry.

303
00:15:31,618 --> 00:15:33,131
She likes to worry about you.

304
00:15:33,372 --> 00:15:34,858
I don't want her to.

305
00:15:35,302 --> 00:15:36,940
College is expensive.

306
00:15:37,692 --> 00:15:38,777
We'll manage.

307
00:15:38,905 --> 00:15:39,837
We always have.

308
00:15:42,530 --> 00:15:43,408
What?

309
00:15:43,590 --> 00:15:44,693
You said we.

310
00:15:48,302 --> 00:15:52,101
I, um... asked your mom out on a date.

311
00:15:52,630 --> 00:15:53,810
I hope that's okay with you.

312
00:15:54,053 --> 00:15:55,359
I think it's great.

313
00:15:55,693 --> 00:15:56,675
What did she say?

314
00:15:57,152 --> 00:15:58,097
Funny.

315
00:15:58,495 --> 00:16:01,021
I guess you had to ask the question.

316
00:16:01,143 --> 00:16:03,880
My track record with your mom is about as bad as the Ravens'.

317
00:16:03,992 --> 00:16:04,867
Aah!

318
00:16:05,005 --> 00:16:06,053
So, do me a favor --

319
00:16:06,567 --> 00:16:07,709
win tomorrow night.

320
00:16:08,067 --> 00:16:10,406
I was gonna say "score," but I didn't think that was appropriate.

321
00:16:17,424 --> 00:16:19,581
Oh, hi. Come on in. Have you seen my friend Mouth?

322
00:16:19,677 --> 00:16:22,121
He looks just like you, only he has a skank attached to his hip.

323
00:16:22,217 --> 00:16:25,682
I'm sorry, Brooke. I was trying to help all the cheerleaders, including you.

324
00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:28,904
Well, for the record, when you're helping Rachel, you are not helping me.

325
00:16:29,028 --> 00:16:30,883
I don't think she tried to set you up.

326
00:16:30,997 --> 00:16:34,409
She said she had no idea it was the same weekend when she submitted your designs.

327
00:16:34,504 --> 00:16:37,734
And you believed her? Mouth, she is lying, okay?

328
00:16:37,815 --> 00:16:40,714
If you weren't so busy trying to see through her shirt, you would see through her B.S. --

329
00:16:40,813 --> 00:16:42,063
She's using you.

330
00:16:42,259 --> 00:16:42,966
How?

331
00:16:43,077 --> 00:16:45,567
I don't know. I am not a conniving bitch.

332
00:16:45,668 --> 00:16:49,396
But I know that if she's being nice to you, it is for a reason, and not a good one.

333
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:52,399
If you want a new friend, hang out with the raisin girl.

334
00:16:52,515 --> 00:16:53,829
Her name is Gigi.

335
00:16:53,942 --> 00:16:56,997
Yes, Gigi -- good. Rachel -- bad.

336
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,057
So, I should stick with my own kind.

337
00:17:00,163 --> 00:17:05,160
I'm not saying that. I just know how someone like her sees someone like you.

338
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:06,831
Someone like me?

339
00:17:08,556 --> 00:17:09,591
I get it.

340
00:17:09,703 --> 00:17:13,084
A hot girl would never hang out with someone like me unless she wanted something.

341
00:17:13,191 --> 00:17:14,532
No,  Mouth, wait.

342
00:17:14,644 --> 00:17:16,281
Why? Do you have no furniture for me to move?

343
00:17:19,172 --> 00:17:20,569
Your parents aren't around?

344
00:17:20,691 --> 00:17:23,176
No, but that's not unusual for Tree Hill.

345
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:25,992
We should have milk cartons with missing parents on them.

346
00:17:26,321 --> 00:17:28,222
It must be difficult being alone.

347
00:17:28,329 --> 00:17:29,531
I'm not alone.

348
00:17:29,848 --> 00:17:31,239
I hate being alone.

349
00:17:31,339 --> 00:17:36,012
I have my roommate and my squad, my friends, my Peyton, my Lucas.

350
00:17:36,142 --> 00:17:40,235
Hey. I didn't know what to get you, so I got a little bit of everything.

351
00:17:41,297 --> 00:17:44,193
Is there a kick in the head in there? 'Cause that's what I deserve.

352
00:17:45,501 --> 00:17:46,398
What's wrong?

353
00:17:47,642 --> 00:17:50,879
Mouth came over earlier, and I went all "mean girls" on him.

354
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,890
Wait a second. You were mean to Mouth?

355
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:56,600
Yeah, you know what? There might be a kick in the head here somewhere.

356
00:17:56,726 --> 00:17:59,586
He's gotten all buddy-buddy with that escort wannabe Rachel,

357
00:17:59,688 --> 00:18:02,976
who I found out only entered me in Rogue Vogue because it's the same weekend as the classic.

358
00:18:03,061 --> 00:18:05,042
- So do them both.
- I can't.

359
00:18:05,153 --> 00:18:06,755
I need you to help me decide.

360
00:18:06,910 --> 00:18:09,474
This is my last year to take my squad to the classic and win,

361
00:18:09,568 --> 00:18:12,525
but Rogue Vogue could be my only chance at showing my designs.

362
00:18:12,871 --> 00:18:14,031
You know what I would do if I was you?

363
00:18:14,135 --> 00:18:15,006
Hmm?

364
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:16,970
Do them both.

365
00:18:17,066 --> 00:18:18,039
You are not helping.

366
00:18:18,112 --> 00:18:22,223
Okay, they're in different states, but they're during different times of the weekend.

367
00:18:22,328 --> 00:18:24,774
And I would still have to be in two places at once.

368
00:18:24,888 --> 00:18:26,634
I'm not Supergirl. I can't --

369
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:29,505
I could fly.

370
00:18:30,735 --> 00:18:32,631
Oh, my god. This could totally work.

371
00:18:32,736 --> 00:18:36,449
I could win two trophies and keep one on my dresser and shove the other one up Rachel's --

372
00:18:40,568 --> 00:18:42,063
Hello, Peyton.

373
00:18:42,457 --> 00:18:44,614
Oops, I mean Haley.

374
00:18:44,731 --> 00:18:46,763
It's hard to keep all of Nathan's girlfriends straight.

375
00:18:46,882 --> 00:18:48,999
You know, I'll probably call the next one you.

376
00:18:49,576 --> 00:18:50,995
So, what are you doing here?

377
00:18:51,044 --> 00:18:53,832
Oh, just some official mayor business. Wouldn't want to bore you.

378
00:18:53,933 --> 00:18:55,564
Oh, thanks.

379
00:18:55,852 --> 00:18:57,777
How's my new song doing, anyway?

380
00:18:59,292 --> 00:19:00,571
What are you talking about?

381
00:19:00,678 --> 00:19:01,953
The song you're recording.

382
00:19:02,125 --> 00:19:03,732
Nathan's paying Chris Keller to work with you,

383
00:19:03,826 --> 00:19:07,059
and since I'm paying Nathan's allowance for being such a good little boy,

384
00:19:07,178 --> 00:19:08,462
it's kind of mine.

385
00:19:09,496 --> 00:19:10,650
Oh...

386
00:19:11,114 --> 00:19:13,111
you didn't know where the money was coming from.

387
00:19:13,205 --> 00:19:15,246
Don't you and Nathan talk about anything?

388
00:19:15,359 --> 00:19:18,753
Yeah, mostly we talk about how happy he is to be away from you.

389
00:19:18,857 --> 00:19:20,510
You know, that's not exactly the thank you I was expecting

390
00:19:20,589 --> 00:19:23,404
after dropping thousands of dollars on your career.

391
00:19:24,491 --> 00:19:26,241
I'll see you in class.

392
00:19:30,367 --> 00:19:34,713
Nathan... did you pay Chris to help me with my music?

393
00:19:34,824 --> 00:19:35,734
Good morning to you, too.

394
00:19:35,839 --> 00:19:37,658
I just ran into your dad. Is that true?

395
00:19:38,144 --> 00:19:39,041
Yeah.

396
00:19:39,754 --> 00:19:42,981
Why didn't you tell me, Nathan? I want us to be honest with each other about everything.

397
00:19:43,086 --> 00:19:45,941
So, what, every time I want to do something nice for you, I have to ask first?

398
00:19:46,055 --> 00:19:48,086
No, that's not the point. It was very nice,

399
00:19:48,183 --> 00:19:51,946
but you, like, totally went behind my back, and it felt like something Dan would do.

400
00:19:58,599 --> 00:20:00,368
Do I have to change the locks at school now?

401
00:20:00,481 --> 00:20:02,170
I'm the mayor. I have the keys to the city.

402
00:20:02,281 --> 00:20:04,762
Besides, is that any way to talk to your new teacher?

403
00:20:05,321 --> 00:20:08,238
Principal Turner asked me to speak to your political-science class.

404
00:20:08,374 --> 00:20:09,410
You're kidding.

405
00:20:09,670 --> 00:20:11,508
I need to get away from my dad,

406
00:20:11,673 --> 00:20:13,223
and basketball's the way out.

407
00:20:13,331 --> 00:20:17,504
The plan's always been high school and then Duke, then the NBA.

408
00:20:17,610 --> 00:20:19,033
Who came up with this plan?

409
00:20:21,650 --> 00:20:22,680
My dad.

410
00:20:23,216 --> 00:20:25,034
Whoa, where are you going? Are you just gonna skip class?

411
00:20:25,137 --> 00:20:27,586
I've heard you speak, dad. Waste of time.

412
00:20:38,883 --> 00:20:40,851
Have you talked to your parents about college?

413
00:20:41,051 --> 00:20:44,701
Well, I mean, my birth mom's really the only one that's around right now,

414
00:20:44,814 --> 00:20:46,653
and she didn't go.

415
00:20:47,162 --> 00:20:48,810
What did she do after high school?

416
00:20:48,935 --> 00:20:49,934
Drugs.

417
00:20:51,137 --> 00:20:53,665
Well, you didn't go to college, and you're doing just fine.

418
00:20:53,789 --> 00:20:57,007
I'm a freelance writer who lives paycheck to paycheck.

419
00:20:57,671 --> 00:20:58,863
I've done okay,

420
00:20:59,466 --> 00:21:01,000
but I could have done better.

421
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:04,150
You don't want to go to college?

422
00:21:04,275 --> 00:21:05,941
Does that surprise you?

423
00:21:06,065 --> 00:21:08,945
Actually, it does. I'd just assumed you'd go.

424
00:21:09,078 --> 00:21:09,777
Why?

425
00:21:09,895 --> 00:21:11,122
Because you can.

426
00:21:13,489 --> 00:21:17,065
I never understood people who had the chance to go and chose not to.

427
00:21:17,181 --> 00:21:21,060
Well, I don't understand people that waste four years in school

428
00:21:21,156 --> 00:21:23,159
when they could be out living life.

429
00:21:23,986 --> 00:21:25,062
What's the hurry?

430
00:21:25,189 --> 00:21:27,150
From what I hear, college is fun.

431
00:21:27,281 --> 00:21:30,817
I can see you majoring in art or music or business.

432
00:21:30,933 --> 00:21:35,512
Really? You see all that without tarot cards or a ouija board?

433
00:21:35,652 --> 00:21:37,226
What else do you see?

434
00:21:37,394 --> 00:21:39,502
I see you being late for cheerleading.

435
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:43,156
I guess you really are psychic.

436
00:21:43,674 --> 00:21:45,742
All right. Well, how 'bout this?

437
00:21:45,847 --> 00:21:49,089
Do you by any chance see a name for this album?

438
00:21:49,281 --> 00:21:51,719
Hopefully something better than "this album."

439
00:21:51,816 --> 00:21:54,707
I don't know. It's kind of growing on me.

440
00:21:56,243 --> 00:21:58,051
Okay. Have fun.

441
00:21:58,187 --> 00:22:01,140
Don't benefit any friends, and do good cheering.

442
00:22:01,238 --> 00:22:02,650
Go, Ravens.

443
00:22:04,253 --> 00:22:09,102
I'm starting to doubt my powers, 'cause I never would have seen you as a cheerleader.

444
00:22:09,808 --> 00:22:11,386
My mom was a cheerleader.

445
00:22:12,574 --> 00:22:16,752
I just want my mom to stop worrying and enjoy life.

446
00:22:17,143 --> 00:22:18,572
She deserves that much.

447
00:22:22,771 --> 00:22:24,520
So, tonight's the big night.

448
00:22:24,654 --> 00:22:25,748
Are you excited?

449
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:28,658
I mean, Keith is, like, the most popular kid in school.

450
00:22:29,088 --> 00:22:30,777
Don't make fun of me.

451
00:22:30,922 --> 00:22:32,055
I'm too nervous.

452
00:22:36,648 --> 00:22:38,138
All right. Now...

453
00:22:39,519 --> 00:22:40,626
how do I look?

454
00:22:41,713 --> 00:22:43,020
Like my mom.

455
00:22:43,135 --> 00:22:44,304
I'm serious.

456
00:22:45,009 --> 00:22:46,327
You look great, ma.

457
00:22:46,674 --> 00:22:49,850
You looked great the last time you asked me and the time before that.

458
00:22:50,193 --> 00:22:52,470
And what about the time before that?

459
00:22:52,915 --> 00:22:54,737
Oh, so-so.

460
00:22:56,757 --> 00:22:58,921
Shouldn't dating get easier?

461
00:22:59,252 --> 00:23:01,569
Oh, um... okay.

462
00:23:01,795 --> 00:23:03,329
Do you want me to have a little talk with him --

463
00:23:03,442 --> 00:23:06,280
make sure his intentions are honorable?

464
00:23:06,437 --> 00:23:07,408
I got it from here.

465
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:12,694
All right. Um... good luck at the game.

466
00:23:12,859 --> 00:23:14,568
You will be joining us for dinner afterwards?

467
00:23:14,675 --> 00:23:15,579
I'll be there.

468
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:16,605
Okay.

469
00:23:16,787 --> 00:23:20,013
This is getting pretty serious -- bringing him home to meet the fam?

470
00:23:20,257 --> 00:23:21,499
Enough!

471
00:23:29,941 --> 00:23:32,178
Keith, you look...

472
00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:35,494
You look... too.

473
00:23:41,029 --> 00:23:45,798
I, uh, have a confession. I was pretty nervous about tonight.

474
00:23:45,912 --> 00:23:47,158
Oh, yeah, me too.

475
00:23:47,531 --> 00:23:49,574
I actually changed my shirt three times.

476
00:23:50,016 --> 00:23:53,070
I was gonna change again, and I realized I only have three shirts.

477
00:23:53,204 --> 00:23:55,008
- Well, I like that one. 
- Thanks.

478
00:23:55,916 --> 00:23:57,081
This is yours?

479
00:23:57,478 --> 00:23:59,368
This is the car I've always dreamed about,

480
00:23:59,478 --> 00:24:02,335
which makes it perfect for tonight.

481
00:24:03,276 --> 00:24:05,338
What made you finally decide to buy it?

482
00:24:05,559 --> 00:24:08,974
Lately I've been less about talking and more about doing.

483
00:24:17,969 --> 00:24:19,993
So, why don't you like to talk about college?

484
00:24:21,008 --> 00:24:24,171
'Cause it freaks me out, okay?

485
00:24:24,275 --> 00:24:26,755
I, uh -- I like high school.

486
00:24:26,871 --> 00:24:28,311
I'm good at high school.

487
00:24:28,475 --> 00:24:32,187
You know, I know who my friends are and who my enemy is.

488
00:24:32,465 --> 00:24:34,165
I've got this place down.

489
00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:37,632
Rachel.

490
00:24:38,529 --> 00:24:41,590
Question -- what do Rogue Vogue and the classic have in common?

491
00:24:41,684 --> 00:24:44,757
Answer? Brooke Davis. Nice try, but I'm doing both.

492
00:24:44,851 --> 00:24:45,899
How are you gonna do that?

493
00:24:46,009 --> 00:24:48,533
It's called "you're an idiot." One's on saturday, one's on sunday,

494
00:24:48,625 --> 00:24:50,668
and there's a flight smack-dab in the middle,

495
00:24:50,772 --> 00:24:54,069
so you're gonna have to try harder next time you practice bitchcraft.

496
00:24:54,596 --> 00:24:57,796
Won't you just be the busiest girl in ho business?

497
00:24:57,894 --> 00:24:59,540
And you'll be taking a backseat,

498
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:01,435
but I guess you're used to that.

499
00:25:20,232 --> 00:25:22,433
This gym's nearly as old as you are.

500
00:25:22,553 --> 00:25:24,430
Yeah, but I look better.

501
00:25:24,563 --> 00:25:25,707
Hey, Whitey.

502
00:25:26,108 --> 00:25:27,425
Gonna win one for us tonight?

503
00:25:27,532 --> 00:25:30,336
Well, it depends. Are you gonna stick around and watch?

504
00:25:30,448 --> 00:25:31,762
Yeah, I'll be here.

505
00:25:31,991 --> 00:25:33,417
I bet you will.

506
00:25:36,359 --> 00:25:38,152
Good to have you home, Keith.

507
00:25:38,622 --> 00:25:42,726
All I need now is a win to make this night perfect.

508
00:25:46,587 --> 00:25:48,877
Your basketball career could end just like that.

509
00:25:48,981 --> 00:25:51,456
You need to think about your education, too.

510
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:52,659
You don't get it.

511
00:25:52,807 --> 00:25:55,939
Without basketball, I'm not gonna have an education.

512
00:25:56,056 --> 00:25:58,334
I'm not gonna get into college based on my grades.

513
00:25:58,462 --> 00:26:00,222
Basketball's all I've got.

514
00:26:05,911 --> 00:26:10,654
This place is disgusting. I can actually see the germs in the air.

515
00:26:13,008 --> 00:26:14,295
Yeah, me too.

516
00:26:16,689 --> 00:26:18,814
Nathan, good news.

517
00:26:18,935 --> 00:26:20,190
What, I'm adopted?

518
00:26:20,704 --> 00:26:21,842
David Shea is here.

519
00:26:21,932 --> 00:26:22,814
What?

520
00:26:23,902 --> 00:26:26,331
If you want to play for any basketball powerhouse on the east coast,

521
00:26:26,429 --> 00:26:28,656
that's the Scout you want to impress.

522
00:26:28,956 --> 00:26:32,074
Seems all those phone calls I made on your behalf paid off.

523
00:26:32,185 --> 00:26:33,742
This has nothing to do with you.

524
00:26:33,853 --> 00:26:35,441
If he's here, it's because of me.

525
00:26:35,737 --> 00:26:37,114
You can't own this one.

526
00:26:38,339 --> 00:26:42,132
All right, let's bring it in! Come on! Move it! Move, move, move!

527
00:26:42,298 --> 00:26:43,819
This is Gigi Silveri.

528
00:26:43,949 --> 00:26:46,870
Now that the Ravens have stripped out of their street clothes

529
00:26:46,942 --> 00:26:51,483
and put on tight shorts that caress their firm buttocks,

530
00:26:51,618 --> 00:26:53,144
we're ready to get under way.

531
00:26:53,252 --> 00:26:54,089
Mouth?

532
00:26:54,691 --> 00:26:56,693
That was... good.

533
00:26:56,789 --> 00:26:58,044
All right, here's the deal.

534
00:26:58,156 --> 00:27:02,478
You want to go back to playing in a gym that doesn't smell like moldy cheese?

535
00:27:02,573 --> 00:27:06,078
Well, go out there and win a game for a change!

536
00:27:06,189 --> 00:27:07,337
All right, on 3.

537
00:27:07,598 --> 00:27:09,767
- 1, 2, 3!
- Win!

538
00:27:10,870 --> 00:27:13,341
Nathan! Not tonight.

539
00:27:13,682 --> 00:27:14,789
You have a seat.

540
00:27:14,928 --> 00:27:16,438
What? Why?

541
00:27:16,540 --> 00:27:19,553
I understand you skipped political science this morning.

542
00:27:19,646 --> 00:27:21,666
Coach, my dad was there. He knew I was skipping.

543
00:27:21,778 --> 00:27:22,814
I didn't.

544
00:27:22,932 --> 00:27:24,300
You know the policy.

545
00:27:24,450 --> 00:27:27,425
You miss school, you miss the game -- no exceptions.

546
00:27:27,525 --> 00:27:28,826
Dustin, you're in.

547
00:27:28,938 --> 00:27:31,607
No, no, coach. There's a big-time Scout here. I have to play tonight.

548
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:35,570
Nathan, sit down -- now!

549
00:27:50,081 --> 00:27:51,913
What if basketball doesn't work out?

550
00:27:53,530 --> 00:27:55,287
I don't expect it to.

551
00:27:55,634 --> 00:27:59,640
But if it can help me get into a good college and help my mom at the same time,

552
00:27:59,737 --> 00:28:01,735
I'm gonna throw everything I have into it.

553
00:28:01,828 --> 00:28:04,424
Defense! Defense!

554
00:28:04,623 --> 00:28:07,729
Defense! Defense!

555
00:28:07,917 --> 00:28:09,109
Defense!

556
00:28:26,146 --> 00:28:27,842
Piece of advice for you, gramps --

557
00:28:27,954 --> 00:28:29,696
most coaches play their leading scorers.

558
00:28:29,795 --> 00:28:31,830
It kind of helps them, you know, win.

559
00:28:31,929 --> 00:28:34,692
Wow. The mayor's talking to me.

560
00:28:34,825 --> 00:28:36,093
What an honor.

561
00:28:47,819 --> 00:28:52,460
And there's the end of the first half. The Ravens trail in a close one, 37-34.

562
00:28:52,530 --> 00:28:55,375
We'll be back in a few minutes with the start of the second half.

563
00:28:59,265 --> 00:29:00,396
I'll be right back.

564
00:29:08,922 --> 00:29:10,102
Can I talk to you, coach?

565
00:29:10,219 --> 00:29:12,546
Not if it's about your brother, Ferris Bueller.

566
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:14,677
But the only reason Nathan skipped class was because of Dan,

567
00:29:14,780 --> 00:29:17,472
and the only way to get him away from Dan is to let the Scouts see him play.

568
00:29:17,572 --> 00:29:19,527
It's not your place to defend him.

569
00:29:19,633 --> 00:29:22,032
Yes, it is. You made me co-captain, didn't you?

570
00:29:22,135 --> 00:29:23,639
Well, he's my teammate, and the team needs him.

571
00:29:23,739 --> 00:29:27,583
I appreciate your concern for your teammate, but rules are rules,

572
00:29:27,675 --> 00:29:30,390
and you're gonna have to find a way to win without him.

573
00:29:39,107 --> 00:29:40,640
Funny running into you here.

574
00:29:41,088 --> 00:29:42,650
Am I in the right bathroom?

575
00:29:42,754 --> 00:29:45,144
Mouth, I'm really, really, really sorry.

576
00:29:45,537 --> 00:29:49,849
Okay? I didn't mean to hurt you. I just meant a guy like you is...

577
00:29:50,494 --> 00:29:53,046
one of my very best friends,

578
00:29:53,422 --> 00:29:57,530
and I was just trying to protect you from one of my very unbest friends.

579
00:30:00,631 --> 00:30:02,030
It's okay, Brooke.

580
00:30:02,322 --> 00:30:03,732
Can I make it up to you?

581
00:30:03,863 --> 00:30:05,567
Hang out after the game?

582
00:30:06,847 --> 00:30:09,484
I never thought I'd be propositioned in a men's room --

583
00:30:09,608 --> 00:30:10,859
and like it, anyway.

584
00:30:10,930 --> 00:30:12,037
Is that a yes?

585
00:30:12,371 --> 00:30:15,332
Well... I kind of have plans.

586
00:30:16,612 --> 00:30:17,760
With Rachel.

587
00:30:18,425 --> 00:30:19,839
I'd invite you, but --

588
00:30:19,940 --> 00:30:21,088
It's okay.

589
00:30:22,874 --> 00:30:24,328
Be careful, Mouth.

590
00:30:35,645 --> 00:30:36,780
David Shea.

591
00:30:37,432 --> 00:30:39,638
Mayor Dan Scott, Nathan's father.

592
00:30:39,737 --> 00:30:41,524
Oh, I was looking forward to seeing your son play.

593
00:30:41,628 --> 00:30:42,601
Who wasn't?

594
00:30:42,705 --> 00:30:47,080
Listen, David, the truth is, coach Durham has a personal issue with me.

595
00:30:47,188 --> 00:30:49,181
Unfortunately, he's punishing Nathan for it.

596
00:30:49,291 --> 00:30:50,386
It's sad, really.

597
00:30:50,490 --> 00:30:52,277
Well, Lucas is playing well.

598
00:30:52,449 --> 00:30:53,800
Oh, that's even sadder.

599
00:30:53,903 --> 00:30:55,317
Were you talking about Lucas?

600
00:30:55,543 --> 00:30:58,968
'Cause I'm, uh, Keith, Lucas' uncle.

601
00:30:59,213 --> 00:31:00,472
He's having quite a night.

602
00:31:00,578 --> 00:31:02,352
Yeah. He's a really good kid,

603
00:31:02,454 --> 00:31:03,806
and he's got great grades, too.

604
00:31:03,912 --> 00:31:05,061
That's nice to hear.

605
00:31:05,185 --> 00:31:08,922
Well, uh, I've got to get back inside. It's nice to meet you two.

606
00:31:09,455 --> 00:31:10,541
You too.

607
00:31:13,570 --> 00:31:14,849
Ohh.

608
00:31:15,287 --> 00:31:16,858
You both could do better.

609
00:31:17,028 --> 00:31:18,772
God knows I've done worse.

610
00:31:22,644 --> 00:31:23,869
Hey, Keith...

611
00:31:24,719 --> 00:31:26,568
I wouldn't leave town if I were you.

612
00:31:27,237 --> 00:31:29,462
I'm not going anywhere, Danny.

613
00:31:29,573 --> 00:31:30,622
I wouldn't dream of it.

614
00:31:45,101 --> 00:31:47,609
I-I feel like I can't win. I mean, do I go on without him?

615
00:31:47,678 --> 00:31:50,915
Do I beg him to come with me, follow him wherever he goes?

616
00:31:52,345 --> 00:31:55,681
I don't think you ever realize how much you love something until you have to give it up.

617
00:32:01,267 --> 00:32:03,194
What is that boy on?

618
00:32:03,533 --> 00:32:04,502
Or not on.

619
00:32:04,650 --> 00:32:08,025
Okay, time winding down in the fourth quarter. The Ravens need a basket.

620
00:32:08,146 --> 00:32:11,041
Lucas Scott drives into the lane. He puts the shot up and scores,

621
00:32:11,141 --> 00:32:14,346
and the Ravens are down by 1 -- 11 seconds left in the game.

622
00:32:14,439 --> 00:32:15,644
Move, move, move, move!

623
00:32:15,815 --> 00:32:18,421
All right, now, I want you guys to take a good look around you.

624
00:32:18,533 --> 00:32:21,489
Take a good, hard look, because once in a while,

625
00:32:21,577 --> 00:32:24,858
you have to ask yourself how you got to this place --

626
00:32:24,966 --> 00:32:29,730
0-2 playing in this crummy sweatbox of a gym.

627
00:32:29,843 --> 00:32:34,322
Well, I'll tell you how you got there. You got there by playing selfishly and losing.

628
00:32:34,429 --> 00:32:39,956
But for the next 9 seconds, if you change the first thing, you'll change the second.

629
00:32:40,055 --> 00:32:41,233
All right, let's go.

630
00:32:42,032 --> 00:32:44,247
- 1, 2, 3...
- Ravens!

631
00:32:48,276 --> 00:32:49,757
Did your father go to Duke?

632
00:32:50,317 --> 00:32:51,231
No.

633
00:32:52,231 --> 00:32:53,374
But I'm better than him.

634
00:32:56,328 --> 00:32:57,250
Lucas.

635
00:33:00,244 --> 00:33:01,360
The dead spot --

636
00:33:01,839 --> 00:33:03,711
Fleming has no left, all right?

637
00:33:03,801 --> 00:33:05,938
He'll go to his right, so if you force him to the dead spot,

638
00:33:06,021 --> 00:33:07,388
you'll be able to pick his pocket.

639
00:33:51,255 --> 00:33:54,566
I never would have joined the basketball team if it wasn't for my uncle Keith.

640
00:33:55,182 --> 00:33:57,131
He wanted me to be a part of something,

641
00:33:57,729 --> 00:33:59,274
to feel like I belong.

642
00:34:15,719 --> 00:34:17,721
It sounds like he really cares about you.

643
00:34:20,489 --> 00:34:22,231
Yeah, he's like a father to me.

644
00:34:34,978 --> 00:34:36,301
You keep playing like that

645
00:34:36,396 --> 00:34:38,649
and you might have a chance with the captain of the cheerleaders.

646
00:34:38,762 --> 00:34:39,846
Really? She say something?

647
00:34:39,966 --> 00:34:41,545
Yeah. She said this.

648
00:34:43,607 --> 00:34:44,785
You coming over tonight?

649
00:34:45,003 --> 00:34:47,985
I don't know. I'm gonna have dinner with Keith and my mom.

650
00:34:48,110 --> 00:34:49,591
So, how 'bout after that?

651
00:34:49,715 --> 00:34:52,814
You don't want to hang around and be a third wheel. What if they want to get freaky?

652
00:34:52,941 --> 00:34:55,758
That's my mom -- not a visual I want to have in my head.

653
00:34:55,868 --> 00:34:57,829
So, how 'bout you come over,

654
00:34:57,948 --> 00:34:59,230
and I'll give you a better one?

655
00:34:59,335 --> 00:35:00,059
Oh, yeah?

656
00:35:00,166 --> 00:35:01,111
Yeah.

657
00:35:02,185 --> 00:35:03,651
Have fun with your family.

658
00:35:11,055 --> 00:35:11,991
You okay?

659
00:35:12,286 --> 00:35:13,192
Yeah.

660
00:35:13,587 --> 00:35:15,350
I'm just worried about Lucas.

661
00:35:16,848 --> 00:35:18,503
I'm sorry you didn't get to play today.

662
00:35:18,636 --> 00:35:20,484
I know you wanted to impress that Scout.

663
00:35:20,583 --> 00:35:24,606
Why? You don't think he was impressed with my bench-sitting skills?

664
00:35:29,031 --> 00:35:31,463
Haley... I'm sorry.

665
00:35:31,798 --> 00:35:34,245
I wish I had an answer for all the school stuff.

666
00:35:34,347 --> 00:35:37,650
It's just... if I tell you not to go to Stanford,

667
00:35:37,745 --> 00:35:40,458
I'm telling you not to follow your dreams -- again.

668
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:44,196
If I tell you to go, I'm saying I don't want to be with you.

669
00:35:45,446 --> 00:35:46,944
So, what do you want me to say?

670
00:35:48,747 --> 00:35:50,110
Say you love me.

671
00:35:51,396 --> 00:35:52,772
Of course I love you.

672
00:35:53,917 --> 00:35:54,808
Scott!

673
00:35:56,055 --> 00:35:57,120
Dave Shea.

674
00:35:58,229 --> 00:35:59,542
You played a great game today.

675
00:36:00,370 --> 00:36:02,980
Thanks. I had a lot of help.

676
00:36:04,857 --> 00:36:07,042
You know, you should meet my brother, though.

677
00:36:07,167 --> 00:36:09,047
Uh... hey, Nathan!

678
00:36:17,221 --> 00:36:17,855
How you doing?

679
00:36:17,958 --> 00:36:18,726
All right.

680
00:36:19,353 --> 00:36:20,152
Good to meet you.

681
00:36:23,252 --> 00:36:26,006
The truth is, I don't really like to think about college...

682
00:36:26,654 --> 00:36:28,691
'cause that means high school's over.

683
00:36:34,180 --> 00:36:38,346
After graduation, everyone will probably go play basketball

684
00:36:38,707 --> 00:36:41,018
or sing or start record labels.

685
00:36:42,681 --> 00:36:44,849
And I'll have to start all over...

686
00:36:45,935 --> 00:36:47,033
alone.

687
00:36:51,233 --> 00:36:52,467
I'm sure I'll be fine.

688
00:36:56,401 --> 00:36:58,732
But, like I said, I don't like to think about it.

689
00:37:08,605 --> 00:37:12,068
At the end of the day, I just want to be with my family and friends.

690
00:37:12,688 --> 00:37:15,488
I want to play basketball, and I want to go to college.

691
00:37:17,203 --> 00:37:19,291
That's not too much to ask, is it?

692
00:37:21,508 --> 00:37:26,069
It's just hard because the game's the only thing that ever mattered to me...

693
00:37:26,761 --> 00:37:28,282
till Haley came along.

694
00:37:35,543 --> 00:37:39,223
Coach... I wanted to talk to you about not playing me tonight.

695
00:37:40,594 --> 00:37:43,014
I'm not having this conversation again.

696
00:37:44,184 --> 00:37:45,448
It was the right thing to do.

697
00:37:48,262 --> 00:37:50,894
Well, that was a good tip you gave to Lucas.

698
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:53,207
It may have won us the game.

699
00:37:54,561 --> 00:37:58,525
Tonight you put the team ahead of yourself.

700
00:37:58,704 --> 00:38:00,941
That's what a true leader does,

701
00:38:01,168 --> 00:38:03,923
and that's something your father never learned.

702
00:38:04,856 --> 00:38:06,885
And don't worry about that Scout.

703
00:38:07,568 --> 00:38:10,195
I'll see he comes back. You'll get your shot.

704
00:38:10,583 --> 00:38:12,306
Thanks, coach, but, uh...

705
00:38:13,211 --> 00:38:16,667
I was hoping maybe you could call somebody at Stanford.

706
00:38:21,292 --> 00:38:23,264
All right, I'll make a call.

707
00:38:25,767 --> 00:38:30,899
It's just hard because before I was married, I thought Stanford was my future.

708
00:38:33,748 --> 00:38:37,024
But all those different faces I remember, all those different people...

709
00:38:38,839 --> 00:38:40,732
none of them are Nathan.

710
00:38:51,067 --> 00:38:52,804
Hey. Hi.

711
00:38:53,103 --> 00:38:54,250
How was the game?

712
00:38:54,488 --> 00:38:56,063
Yeah, it was okay.

713
00:38:56,375 --> 00:38:59,561
It wasn't exciting watching the Ravens get their first win?

714
00:39:01,552 --> 00:39:02,780
I was there.

715
00:39:03,470 --> 00:39:05,296
Well, why didn't you come say hi?

716
00:39:05,415 --> 00:39:08,401
Oh, I just wanted to watch you do your thing.

717
00:39:08,895 --> 00:39:10,344
You were great.

718
00:39:10,487 --> 00:39:13,026
Yeah, I can go pom-to-pom with the cheeriest.

719
00:39:13,157 --> 00:39:14,907
I'm serious, Peyton.

720
00:39:15,104 --> 00:39:17,291
You're smart, you're funny, you're beautiful,

721
00:39:17,393 --> 00:39:20,150
and what I can see, there's nothing that you're not good at.

722
00:39:21,289 --> 00:39:22,346
You want something?

723
00:39:22,469 --> 00:39:24,790
Except taking compliments, apparently.

724
00:39:25,536 --> 00:39:27,349
No, I'm sorry. I just --

725
00:39:27,862 --> 00:39:29,244
I'm not used to it.

726
00:39:30,676 --> 00:39:33,435
As I watched you tonight, I thought to myself,

727
00:39:35,066 --> 00:39:38,170
"this girl has so much to offer the world.

728
00:39:38,890 --> 00:39:40,812
If only she could see it."

729
00:39:43,115 --> 00:39:44,460
Are you sure you're okay?

730
00:39:44,646 --> 00:39:46,399
Yeah, I'm fine.

731
00:39:47,057 --> 00:39:48,123
I, um...

732
00:39:49,188 --> 00:39:52,483
I came up with a possible album title

733
00:39:52,852 --> 00:39:55,071
and took a shot at the cover art.

734
00:40:00,393 --> 00:40:01,686
What do you think?

735
00:40:03,457 --> 00:40:04,927
"Friends with benefit."

736
00:40:06,941 --> 00:40:08,102
I love it.

737
00:40:10,660 --> 00:40:14,593
So, I think I want to study art and music...

738
00:40:14,788 --> 00:40:16,362
and maybe business.

739
00:40:17,031 --> 00:40:18,533
Any suggestions?

740
00:40:46,148 --> 00:40:47,944
I hope you got your pants on.

741
00:40:52,025 --> 00:40:53,166
Go home, Danny.

742
00:40:54,268 --> 00:40:55,604
This isn't your life.

743
00:40:56,807 --> 00:40:59,431
