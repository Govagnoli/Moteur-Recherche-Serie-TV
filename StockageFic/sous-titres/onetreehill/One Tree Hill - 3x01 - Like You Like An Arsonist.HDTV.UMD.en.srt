1
00:00:22,222 --> 00:00:24,572
Oh, Nathan, I was hoping that was you.

2
00:00:24,715 --> 00:00:26,158
I've been here alone all night.

3
00:00:27,117 --> 00:00:28,683
I had something to do.

4
00:00:29,709 --> 00:00:30,853
Oh, honey.

5
00:00:33,156 --> 00:00:36,275
I know this is hard for you, but I promise you,

6
00:00:36,398 --> 00:00:38,386
we'll be free soon.

7
00:00:38,821 --> 00:00:39,993
I know we will.

8
00:00:53,444 --> 00:00:54,406
Hi.

9
00:00:55,309 --> 00:00:56,501
What are you doing here?

10
00:00:57,437 --> 00:00:59,650
I want to come home, Nathan.

11
00:01:02,601 --> 00:01:04,269
This is really bad timing.

12
00:01:05,401 --> 00:01:06,777
Nathan, we have to go.

13
00:01:07,586 --> 00:01:08,558
What's going on?

14
00:01:08,564 --> 00:01:11,311
It's urgent. It's your father. We have to go now.

15
00:01:12,586 --> 00:01:13,581
Sorry.

16
00:01:16,428 --> 00:01:17,334
Haley.

17
00:01:18,362 --> 00:01:19,464
Come with us.

18
00:01:41,575 --> 00:01:43,328
Looks like it's just you and me this summer.

19
00:01:53,194 --> 00:01:54,438
Peyton, what's wrong?

20
00:01:57,183 --> 00:01:58,718
Come on, let's get you home.

21
00:01:58,730 --> 00:02:01,704
Mnh-mnh, I can't be there alone.

22
00:02:06,174 --> 00:02:07,746
Will you stay with me?

23
00:02:28,429 --> 00:02:29,992
Hey, you got to talk to me.

24
00:02:30,219 --> 00:02:31,508
What's going on with you?

25
00:02:34,314 --> 00:02:36,776
I've been getting these creepy e-mails lately.

26
00:02:37,364 --> 00:02:40,427
Then, tonight this woman shows up,

27
00:02:41,502 --> 00:02:44,093
and she knew things about me.

28
00:02:46,561 --> 00:02:47,979
What kind of things?

29
00:02:52,414 --> 00:02:54,047
She says she's my mother.

30
00:02:55,496 --> 00:02:58,434
My mom's dead, Luke. I was there in the hospital.

31
00:02:58,603 --> 00:02:59,965
I watched her die.

32
00:03:08,506 --> 00:03:09,407
What?

33
00:03:11,102 --> 00:03:13,338
I did something tonight, Peyton.

34
00:03:15,669 --> 00:03:17,702
And I can't take it back.

35
00:03:44,801 --> 00:03:47,843
It's your father's car. He was working late.

36
00:03:52,707 --> 00:03:53,910
Mrs. Scott?

37
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:55,756
My husband was inside.

38
00:03:55,767 --> 00:03:56,874
They didn't tell you?

39
00:03:58,487 --> 00:03:59,363
Wait here.

40
00:03:59,999 --> 00:04:02,507
Captain, Mrs. Scott's here!

41
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,550
Okay, putting aside the fact that I do look pretty good,

42
00:05:11,586 --> 00:05:14,249
considering I've been on the plane for like a day and a half,

43
00:05:14,299 --> 00:05:17,063
you cannot ambush me at the airport with flowers

44
00:05:17,121 --> 00:05:21,278
and a nicely tanned end-of-summer body, considering the way we left things...

45
00:05:24,047 --> 00:05:25,190
...three months ago.

46
00:05:26,212 --> 00:05:26,965
Okay.

47
00:05:26,978 --> 00:05:29,737
Actually, I'm just here to pick up my mom from New Zealand.

48
00:05:30,157 --> 00:05:32,522
I didn't think you were coming in till tomorrow.

49
00:05:32,534 --> 00:05:33,531
You thought wrong.

50
00:05:33,601 --> 00:05:35,119
Oh, look, there's my cab.

51
00:05:35,175 --> 00:05:37,391
Quick, maybe you can tell me you love me or something.

52
00:05:41,104 --> 00:05:42,041
Hi, honey.

53
00:05:47,478 --> 00:05:48,855
Welcome home, mom.

54
00:05:49,042 --> 00:05:50,832
You haven't missed a thing.

55
00:06:00,276 --> 00:06:01,534
It's about time.

56
00:06:02,368 --> 00:06:05,823
I knew you couldn't go an entire summer without doing something here.

57
00:06:05,834 --> 00:06:06,903
Whatever.

58
00:06:06,975 --> 00:06:08,030
You don't know me.

59
00:06:08,206 --> 00:06:09,705
Oh, I think I do.

60
00:06:12,069 --> 00:06:15,172
Okay, so, check it out, Tom Sawyer.

61
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:18,256
If you're lucky, I might let you help me.

62
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:21,736
And if you're really lucky, I might even let you pay to help me.

63
00:06:21,792 --> 00:06:23,021
What do you say?

64
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,123
Brooke's home.

65
00:06:27,911 --> 00:06:31,177
Went to the airport this morning to pick up my mom, and poof -- there was Brooke.

66
00:06:31,392 --> 00:06:32,186
Poof?

67
00:06:32,539 --> 00:06:33,410
Poof.

68
00:06:35,437 --> 00:06:36,922
What are you gonna tell her?

69
00:06:42,955 --> 00:06:44,930
You're not doing this again?

70
00:06:45,011 --> 00:06:48,739
You've turned Nathan's room inside out how many times over the last three months?

71
00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:51,089
Those annulment papers got to be here somewhere.

72
00:06:52,343 --> 00:06:57,089
Dan, you know what the doctor said. Getting agitated is just going to make your burns itch.

73
00:07:00,493 --> 00:07:03,468
Isn't this really about the dealership?

74
00:07:03,822 --> 00:07:06,695
It's nearly rebuilt. You'll be going to work soon.

75
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:10,249
It might bring back some bad memories.

76
00:07:14,671 --> 00:07:16,049
I had a dream.

77
00:07:16,889 --> 00:07:19,776
I was at the office. Everything was normal.

78
00:07:24,646 --> 00:07:26,597
Then my arm was on fire.

79
00:07:30,914 --> 00:07:33,452
You still don't remember how it happened?

80
00:07:36,575 --> 00:07:37,866
I was drinking...

81
00:07:41,142 --> 00:07:42,366
...and passed out.

82
00:07:44,066 --> 00:07:45,592
Then I was on the outside...

83
00:07:48,085 --> 00:07:49,575
...on the edge of an inferno.

84
00:07:49,601 --> 00:07:51,315
Everything in between is black.

85
00:07:53,451 --> 00:07:56,922
I suppose our survival skills are more than we know.

86
00:08:00,757 --> 00:08:03,036
At least Nathan will be home soon.

87
00:08:03,123 --> 00:08:04,208
Which home, Deb?

88
00:08:05,216 --> 00:08:06,394
This one

89
00:08:06,742 --> 00:08:07,916
or with Haley?

90
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,206
Yo, big time! You got a letter, man.

91
00:08:19,222 --> 00:08:20,223
Letter?  From who?

92
00:08:20,245 --> 00:08:22,881
I don't know, but whoever it is, she smells hot.

93
00:08:26,998 --> 00:08:28,990
You better just hope she doesn't meet me.

94
00:08:41,161 --> 00:08:42,962
Hey. That was your mom on the phone.

95
00:08:42,973 --> 00:08:45,619
She said she’s gonna spend the night at the hospital with your dad.

96
00:08:45,948 --> 00:08:49,090
Unbelievable -- should have a Scott family discount.

97
00:08:51,799 --> 00:08:53,381
I'm really sorry, Nathan.

98
00:08:54,241 --> 00:08:55,930
About my dad or about us?

99
00:08:57,062 --> 00:08:58,373
About everything.

100
00:09:01,762 --> 00:09:03,477
So, what are you doing here anyway?

101
00:09:03,723 --> 00:09:05,419
Tour playing Tree Hill?

102
00:09:05,496 --> 00:09:06,463
No.

103
00:09:07,252 --> 00:09:12,162
They wanted me to become a solo artist and record a record or something, but...

104
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:14,814
it didn't matter without you.

105
00:09:15,137 --> 00:09:17,174
None of it mattered without you.

106
00:09:19,421 --> 00:09:21,158
I made a lot of mistakes, Nathan.

107
00:09:21,213 --> 00:09:24,409
That's right, and if you left the tour for me, you made another one,

108
00:09:24,475 --> 00:09:26,017
because I'm leaving in the morning.

109
00:09:26,313 --> 00:09:27,762
I'm going to High Flyers.

110
00:09:29,161 --> 00:09:30,143
Oh.

111
00:09:31,046 --> 00:09:32,395
Well, good.

112
00:09:33,424 --> 00:09:36,708
Good, you deserve it. You deserve to have whatever you want.

113
00:09:38,673 --> 00:09:44,081
Well, listen, there's no more apartment, and I put all your stuff in storage,

114
00:09:44,951 --> 00:09:47,659
so you can spend the night in the guest room if you want.

115
00:09:55,958 --> 00:09:58,769
Nathan, there wasn't a moment when I was away

116
00:09:59,056 --> 00:10:01,632
that my heart wasn't with you in Tree Hill.

117
00:10:01,712 --> 00:10:02,795
That's great.

118
00:10:04,012 --> 00:10:05,805
But I'm still leaving in the morning.

119
00:10:06,481 --> 00:10:10,444
Unlike  you, I'm taking my heart with me.

120
00:10:26,001 --> 00:10:27,431
You talking to me yet?

121
00:10:28,179 --> 00:10:29,091
Yeah.

122
00:10:29,438 --> 00:10:32,398
Good. And I brought you flowers.

123
00:10:32,869 --> 00:10:33,812
Oh.

124
00:10:34,881 --> 00:10:37,396
They're very nice. Where did you get them?

125
00:10:37,406 --> 00:10:38,511
Neighbor's yard.

126
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:43,252
Look, I'm sorry about the airport earlier.

127
00:10:43,330 --> 00:10:44,400
Ah, it's cool.

128
00:10:44,691 --> 00:10:48,410
No, I felt stupid for jumping to conclusions and

129
00:10:48,476 --> 00:10:51,865
maybe a little jealous that you weren't actually there for me.

130
00:10:54,492 --> 00:10:55,878
It's good to see you, Luke.

131
00:10:58,607 --> 00:10:59,706
How you been?

132
00:11:04,690 --> 00:11:06,867
Tell me that was a goodbye kiss.

133
00:11:07,778 --> 00:11:09,627
I want to be with you, Brooke.

134
00:11:12,046 --> 00:11:16,190
Look, I know it wasn't fair how I told you

135
00:11:16,501 --> 00:11:19,769
I wanted to be with you when your cab is just parked right outside.

136
00:11:21,484 --> 00:11:25,166
I just saw you slipping away, and I guess I panicked.

137
00:11:25,932 --> 00:11:27,054
It's okay.

138
00:11:27,403 --> 00:11:29,732
Really, it is.

139
00:11:30,013 --> 00:11:32,803
I actually had the whole summer to think about this, and I thought

140
00:11:32,864 --> 00:11:36,411
we could totally have a summer-like fling, just in the fall...

141
00:11:37,182 --> 00:11:39,989
and non-exclusive.

142
00:11:41,109 --> 00:11:44,385
Non-exclusive? How's that work?

143
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:48,011
Well, we hang out, we go to movies, we have fun.

144
00:11:49,121 --> 00:11:50,189
Do we kiss?

145
00:11:50,311 --> 00:11:52,097
You bet your ass we kiss.

146
00:11:52,646 --> 00:11:54,938
Do we do more than kiss?

147
00:11:55,972 --> 00:11:57,068
Maybe...

148
00:11:58,831 --> 00:12:00,800
but we also date other people.

149
00:12:03,955 --> 00:12:05,393
What do you think?

150
00:12:07,009 --> 00:12:09,525
I kind of think you're a genius.

151
00:12:09,648 --> 00:12:12,515
Oh, you're just figuring that out now, are you?

152
00:12:13,933 --> 00:12:15,689
I missed you, Lucas Scott.

153
00:12:16,529 --> 00:12:18,819
I missed you, too, pretty girl.

154
00:12:19,585 --> 00:12:22,438
Hmm. Call me later.

155
00:12:22,842 --> 00:12:26,585
I have to go deal with Peyton's whole "I'm your mother" scenario.

156
00:12:26,603 --> 00:12:28,629
Right, that one's pretty messy.

157
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:30,276
Yeah, so I've heard.

158
00:12:30,364 --> 00:12:33,160
You leave for a couple months, crazy moms start showing up,

159
00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:35,791
and there's all these things you don't know.

160
00:12:39,555 --> 00:12:40,450
Yeah.

161
00:12:46,806 --> 00:12:48,253
Did you hear something?

162
00:12:48,591 --> 00:12:51,812
Look, Peyton, I locked all the doors.

163
00:12:52,104 --> 00:12:55,022
I didn't hear anything. You're fine. Okay?

164
00:12:59,457 --> 00:13:04,832
So, Brooke said you kept some of the stuff from when we were sort of...

165
00:13:05,384 --> 00:13:06,967
whatever we were.

166
00:13:08,181 --> 00:13:10,044
She thinks you're still into me.

167
00:13:10,587 --> 00:13:13,141
I told Brooke I wanted to be with her today...

168
00:13:14,764 --> 00:13:16,193
before she left.

169
00:13:20,535 --> 00:13:21,590
Nice timing.

170
00:13:22,235 --> 00:13:24,354
I'm a real piece of work, huh?

171
00:13:25,153 --> 00:13:28,620
I mean, every time I play it in my mind, this...

172
00:13:29,198 --> 00:13:31,886
"idiot" light keeps flashing at me.

173
00:13:31,978 --> 00:13:34,954
Like... "Shut up, shut up."

174
00:13:35,002 --> 00:13:35,947
Yeah.

175
00:13:36,318 --> 00:13:40,842
Either you say too much or, like me with Jake, you don't say enough,

176
00:13:41,215 --> 00:13:42,638
and then they're gone.

177
00:13:43,663 --> 00:13:45,952
Yeah. Sorry about Jake.

178
00:13:46,212 --> 00:13:47,454
Yeah, me too.

179
00:13:48,374 --> 00:13:49,920
It broke my heart.

180
00:13:50,852 --> 00:13:52,843
It's been a tough year on hearts.

181
00:13:54,835 --> 00:13:58,690
So, it's too bad we had to be this desperate to hang out again, huh?

182
00:13:59,484 --> 00:14:02,095
Well, we didn't have to be. We just are.

183
00:14:03,437 --> 00:14:05,542
But  I'm glad you're here, you know.

184
00:14:05,817 --> 00:14:08,624
I know we kind of lost each other for a while, but,

185
00:14:09,361 --> 00:14:11,147
hopefully, that's over, right?

186
00:14:11,362 --> 00:14:13,693
Especially considering our history.

187
00:14:14,650 --> 00:14:16,897
It's always gonna be there, isn't it?

188
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:19,088
You and me?

189
00:14:38,258 --> 00:14:39,492
Hi, sweetheart.

190
00:14:39,928 --> 00:14:40,961
Is it true?

191
00:14:41,642 --> 00:14:42,780
Honey, look...

192
00:14:42,871 --> 00:14:46,615
You said you wanted to talk about it face-to-face, dad, so we're face-to-face.

193
00:14:48,073 --> 00:14:49,583
Is this woman my mother?

194
00:14:50,541 --> 00:14:53,382
Your mom is gone, Peyton.

195
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:54,811
You know that.

196
00:14:57,602 --> 00:15:01,365
But your biological mother is alive.

197
00:15:53,083 --> 00:15:54,879
I never knew your father.

198
00:15:58,030 --> 00:15:59,472
We only met Ellie.

199
00:16:00,711 --> 00:16:04,301
We asked that she not make contact with you unless you requested it.

200
00:16:14,494 --> 00:16:17,761
You know, sometimes it's hard for me to look at you without seeing your mom.

201
00:16:18,918 --> 00:16:21,760
You got so much from her in such a short time.

202
00:16:27,746 --> 00:16:29,424
What did I get from her --

203
00:16:29,629 --> 00:16:32,942
exactly? Other than lies?

204
00:17:10,709 --> 00:17:12,623
Just wanted to make sure you have everything you need.

205
00:17:12,714 --> 00:17:14,158
You mean, other than you?

206
00:17:16,252 --> 00:17:17,246
Sorry.

207
00:17:18,228 --> 00:17:19,703
That wasn't fair.

208
00:17:21,757 --> 00:17:23,809
This is really weird, Nathan.

209
00:17:23,871 --> 00:17:25,776
I can just call Peyton or Lucas or something. 

210
00:17:25,781 --> 00:17:27,276
No, Haley, it's late.

211
00:17:28,372 --> 00:17:30,180
Besides, what's the difference?

212
00:17:30,349 --> 00:17:32,862
You turn the lights out, it's all the same darkness, right?

213
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:33,906
Nathan...

214
00:17:35,806 --> 00:17:37,024
You know...

215
00:17:37,956 --> 00:17:42,221
you know when you took those drugs before the game where you collapsed?

216
00:17:42,968 --> 00:17:44,832
You made a mistake...

217
00:17:45,334 --> 00:17:48,992
but...  I know you promised yourself that if you had a second chance, 

218
00:17:48,994 --> 00:17:51,212
you would do things differently.

219
00:17:53,941 --> 00:17:55,826
I know that I hurt you.

220
00:17:57,935 --> 00:18:00,999
But I promised myself that, if I could get you to listen, 

221
00:18:01,835 --> 00:18:04,999
I would tell you that...

222
00:18:06,455 --> 00:18:08,558
there was never a day on that tour 

223
00:18:08,595 --> 00:18:11,758
when I didn't think you were the best part of my life.

224
00:18:12,348 --> 00:18:15,471
You can't just say that, Haley, not after months of silence.

225
00:18:15,508 --> 00:18:16,623
Why? It's the truth.

226
00:18:16,695 --> 00:18:17,857
- Really? 
- Yeah.

227
00:18:17,954 --> 00:18:20,089
What about the day you signed the annulment papers?

228
00:18:20,161 --> 00:18:21,682
The papers that you initiated?

229
00:18:21,753 --> 00:18:25,845
Yeah, after I drove a thousand miles to see you and you didn't even call me after I left.

230
00:18:26,013 --> 00:18:27,227
That must have been a hell of an encore.

231
00:18:27,293 --> 00:18:29,003
Nathan, you just walked away! 

232
00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:30,657
Well,  it beats running away.

233
00:18:31,271 --> 00:18:32,402
I did call.

234
00:18:32,546 --> 00:18:34,271
You called our answering machine, Haley!

235
00:18:34,354 --> 00:18:37,645
Because I knew you were gonna hang up on me anyway, so I had to leave a message!

236
00:18:37,667 --> 00:18:39,044
I didn't even play it.

237
00:18:39,831 --> 00:18:41,456
I deleted you.

238
00:18:45,450 --> 00:18:46,570
Well...

239
00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:50,303
then you deleted... this --

240
00:18:51,905 --> 00:18:55,526
I was being childish when I walked away from you for the tour.

241
00:18:56,523 --> 00:18:59,995
You gave me an ultimatum the night that I left, and

242
00:19:00,687 --> 00:19:03,588
I fought back for all the wrong reasons.

243
00:19:04,198 --> 00:19:06,261
And I was being stubborn

244
00:19:07,485 --> 00:19:11,413
and I can't take that back. I wish that I could.

245
00:19:13,102 --> 00:19:15,002
Did I want to go? Yeah.

246
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:18,038
I loved it. I loved every night of it.

247
00:19:20,167 --> 00:19:22,549
But I want you to know something, Nathan.

248
00:19:22,733 --> 00:19:24,842
There was never a night

249
00:19:26,112 --> 00:19:29,036
where I loved it more than I loved you.

250
00:19:44,564 --> 00:19:46,294
Pretty angry, huh?

251
00:19:47,963 --> 00:19:48,948
Yeah.

252
00:19:49,393 --> 00:19:51,947
You'd think after three months, this would have gone away.

253
00:19:53,115 --> 00:19:55,209
I don't think that's ever going away.

254
00:19:56,889 --> 00:19:58,936
You can probably tell that Nathan's not here.

255
00:19:59,014 --> 00:20:01,215
He moved out before he left for camp.

256
00:20:01,313 --> 00:20:02,510
Yeah, I know.

257
00:20:03,267 --> 00:20:05,869
I'd say "welcome back", but I don't suppose you're staying.

258
00:20:05,971 --> 00:20:07,067
No, I am.

259
00:20:07,104 --> 00:20:10,267
Oh, well, you might be staying, but you're not staying here.

260
00:20:10,333 --> 00:20:12,007
I just rented this place...

261
00:20:12,407 --> 00:20:13,539
for me.

262
00:20:32,654 --> 00:20:34,091
How you feeling, Mouth?

263
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:36,799
Mouth?

264
00:20:39,764 --> 00:20:41,888
Um, weak.

265
00:20:41,936 --> 00:20:44,198
I'm feeling seriously underdeveloped.

266
00:20:44,848 --> 00:20:46,067
Could have fooled me --

267
00:20:46,568 --> 00:20:49,773
who would have thought you could move all this stuff in here by yourself, huh?

268
00:20:50,065 --> 00:20:51,304
Yeah, who knew?

269
00:20:53,481 --> 00:20:54,278
Here.

270
00:20:55,042 --> 00:20:55,954
Thanks.

271
00:21:00,043 --> 00:21:03,689
So, are any of these guys the reason you don't want to date Lucas?

272
00:21:03,782 --> 00:21:07,161
No, I date Lucas, just not exclusively.

273
00:21:07,274 --> 00:21:09,056
So it's kind of like with Felix?

274
00:21:09,137 --> 00:21:13,761
God, no. Felix was a physical thing.

275
00:21:14,119 --> 00:21:16,330
I go for some romance with Lucas.

276
00:21:16,351 --> 00:21:19,977
- But you won't commit to him?
- No, too much drama.

277
00:21:22,091 --> 00:21:23,503
I don't know, Brooke.

278
00:21:24,389 --> 00:21:27,631
I felt larger than life when I was with Erica.

279
00:21:29,075 --> 00:21:31,425
I'd give anything to have that back.

280
00:21:31,691 --> 00:21:33,704
You and Erica broke up?

281
00:21:34,354 --> 00:21:35,285
Yeah.

282
00:21:35,644 --> 00:21:37,410
Why? What happened?

283
00:21:39,913 --> 00:21:41,378
She got popular.

284
00:21:45,914 --> 00:21:48,858
See, this is exactly what I'm talking about.

285
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:52,182
It is so much better to play the field.

286
00:21:55,017 --> 00:21:56,280
Davis?

287
00:21:57,555 --> 00:21:58,637
Come on.

288
00:22:03,554 --> 00:22:06,032
Hey, Mouth, nice work.

289
00:22:06,113 --> 00:22:07,044
Why is that?

290
00:22:07,158 --> 00:22:09,431
Brooke gets a place of her own, and you already got her in the bedroom.

291
00:22:09,528 --> 00:22:12,031
Oh, easy onthe skanky innuendo.

292
00:22:12,069 --> 00:22:13,798
I'm gonna get some more stuff.

293
00:22:13,934 --> 00:22:16,363
You could get the couch.

294
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:18,678
Yeah.

295
00:22:20,434 --> 00:22:22,324
All right, total reverse déjà vu.

296
00:22:22,339 --> 00:22:24,863
I moved all of Nathan's crap out of here three months ago.

297
00:22:24,903 --> 00:22:29,798
Oh, but this is gonna be so much better, because this is our new post-game party palace.

298
00:22:29,865 --> 00:22:33,213
All it needs is a P. Sawyer make-over, a little paint,

299
00:22:33,286 --> 00:22:36,961
a couple of those creepy "nobody understands me" drawings that you do,

300
00:22:37,034 --> 00:22:38,937
and a batch of hot boys.

301
00:22:39,035 --> 00:22:40,596
Hence the skanky innuendo.

302
00:22:40,667 --> 00:22:46,136
Hmm -- first thing we'd have to do is cover up Nathan's hideous paint stain.

303
00:22:46,382 --> 00:22:47,463
I don't know.

304
00:22:47,765 --> 00:22:49,106
I say you leave it.

305
00:22:49,561 --> 00:22:53,294
We can't leave it, Haley's gonna be here now and then. She can't be looking at that.

306
00:22:53,316 --> 00:22:55,782
Why not? It's her fault it's there.

307
00:22:56,222 --> 00:22:57,758
You and Haley fighting?

308
00:22:57,897 --> 00:22:59,736
That depends on which Haley we're talking about --

309
00:22:59,822 --> 00:23:02,393
Haley Scott, the nice girl that played Tric,

310
00:23:02,458 --> 00:23:06,248
or Haley James, the not-so-much-of-a-wife that left town and never called,

311
00:23:06,259 --> 00:23:09,146
because her I have a problem with.

312
00:23:09,243 --> 00:23:12,116
Do you ever think maybe it just got to be too much for her?

313
00:23:12,515 --> 00:23:15,475
Like, leaving the whole Chris thing out of it,

314
00:23:15,506 --> 00:23:18,935
maybe she just got scared of needing somebody too much.

315
00:23:19,437 --> 00:23:22,683
Needing them so much, she just abandoned them?

316
00:23:23,856 --> 00:23:26,661
Okay, you can hate me for saying this, but

317
00:23:26,826 --> 00:23:31,136
maybe your problem isn't so much with Haley as it is with Ellie, your returning birth mother?

318
00:23:31,209 --> 00:23:35,699
No, Brooke, my problem is with anybody who just vanishes and then waltzes back in

319
00:23:35,749 --> 00:23:38,332
and expects to be instantly forgiven. And your problem is 

320
00:23:38,387 --> 00:23:42,036
you're not gonna have anybody to help you paint this place if you keep telling me what my problem is.

321
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:45,318
Sorry.

322
00:23:45,498 --> 00:23:46,460
Too angry?

323
00:23:46,569 --> 00:23:47,950
Just a smidge.

324
00:23:48,227 --> 00:23:50,132
- Dialing back. 
- Thank you.

325
00:23:51,274 --> 00:23:52,057
Look...

326
00:23:53,347 --> 00:23:56,773
all I'm saying is we both know what it's like to have your heart broken.

327
00:23:57,613 --> 00:24:01,299
Maybe Haley just needs a little help, whether or not she's to blame.

328
00:24:20,534 --> 00:24:21,215
Hey.

329
00:24:22,115 --> 00:24:23,099
Are you okay?

330
00:24:24,671 --> 00:24:25,696
Depends.

331
00:24:27,477 --> 00:24:28,774
Are you home for good?

332
00:24:30,462 --> 00:24:31,564
Or for bad.

333
00:24:33,766 --> 00:24:35,101
Ah, good.

334
00:25:01,502 --> 00:25:04,418
Your mom didn't sleep for a week when we brought you home.

335
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:08,806
Every cough, every gurgle,

336
00:25:09,298 --> 00:25:12,575
she'd be up and have you in her arms immediately.

337
00:25:13,983 --> 00:25:18,621
One time, I -- I teased her about it, and she said,

338
00:25:18,643 --> 00:25:20,737
"I'm always gonna be there for her.

339
00:25:22,067 --> 00:25:23,240
No matter what,

340
00:25:24,239 --> 00:25:26,573
she's gonna know her mother loves her."

341
00:25:31,566 --> 00:25:33,397
Honey, we were gonna tell you...

342
00:25:34,524 --> 00:25:35,416
together.

343
00:25:36,608 --> 00:25:38,815
But when she died...

344
00:25:39,710 --> 00:25:43,622
I guess I didn't want to confuse your grief, and...

345
00:25:46,007 --> 00:25:51,517
...I felt so powerless that I couldn't protect you from losing her.

346
00:25:54,753 --> 00:25:58,440
You know, I look at this drawing and I think

347
00:25:59,136 --> 00:26:01,655
you can be mad at me if it helps.

348
00:26:03,462 --> 00:26:06,898
But you leave your mom out of it...

349
00:26:07,881 --> 00:26:10,232
because she never lied to you.

350
00:26:12,008 --> 00:26:15,597
And she loved you with all her heart.

351
00:26:17,103 --> 00:26:19,382
And this other woman, Ellie,

352
00:26:20,605 --> 00:26:24,435
she doesn't change who your mom was...

353
00:26:31,704 --> 00:26:33,333
So don't you...

354
00:26:36,349 --> 00:26:37,901
Don't you dare.

355
00:26:49,753 --> 00:26:52,344
Who is the sexy world traveler?

356
00:26:52,441 --> 00:26:54,914
- Deb! Oh, it's so good to see you.
- Hey, welcome back.  

357
00:26:54,995 --> 00:26:56,741
So, what do you think of the place?

358
00:26:57,207 --> 00:26:59,712
Well, Lucas said it was different.

359
00:26:59,794 --> 00:27:02,628
It's pretty edgy, but I like it.

360
00:27:02,634 --> 00:27:05,169
- And change is good. 
- Yeah.

361
00:27:05,477 --> 00:27:06,680
How have you been?

362
00:27:06,848 --> 00:27:12,107
Well, as you know from my e-mails about Dan,  I have been one miserable bitch -- you?

363
00:27:12,189 --> 00:27:13,878
Well, I've been the miserable part.

364
00:27:14,093 --> 00:27:15,230
I'm sorry.

365
00:27:15,528 --> 00:27:17,351
I guess that means Andy's not back.

366
00:27:17,402 --> 00:27:18,409
Not yet.

367
00:27:18,927 --> 00:27:22,116
We'll see. Hopefully, he'll be back soon.

368
00:27:22,208 --> 00:27:23,918
Have  you heard from Keith?

369
00:27:24,011 --> 00:27:26,243
No, I haven't. I guess you haven't either?

370
00:27:27,931 --> 00:27:30,109
Hey, can a girl get a decent cup of Joe around here?

371
00:27:30,133 --> 00:27:33,309
Oh, one song per cup. Oh, I've missed you, kiddo.

372
00:27:33,311 --> 00:27:34,300
I missed you, too.

373
00:27:34,342 --> 00:27:37,688
I could use a cup of gin -- I mean, coffee -- myself.

374
00:27:37,784 --> 00:27:38,347
Karen?

375
00:27:38,622 --> 00:27:40,774
Yeah, please -- coffee, not gin.

376
00:27:40,856 --> 00:27:41,845
I'll have gin.

377
00:27:42,515 --> 00:27:44,523
So, what brings you around, miss jet-setter?

378
00:27:44,599 --> 00:27:49,938
Ah, well, considering what they pay the opening act, I was kind of hoping for a job.

379
00:27:50,076 --> 00:27:53,390
I asked Haley to come back to the café if it's okay with you.

380
00:27:53,447 --> 00:27:57,705
Oh, of course -- we'd love to have a big pop star performing in our hip, new café.

381
00:27:57,793 --> 00:28:01,075
Actually, I was kind of hoping to waitress like before.

382
00:28:01,167 --> 00:28:02,023
Oh.

383
00:28:02,688 --> 00:28:05,856
Well, table 5 needs a clean-up. Let's see what you got.

384
00:28:05,876 --> 00:28:07,215
- I'm on it.
- Alright.

385
00:28:35,169 --> 00:28:37,770
Well, we were out of gin, so I went with, uh...

386
00:28:38,313 --> 00:28:39,332
coffee.

387
00:28:40,253 --> 00:28:41,304
Thank you.

388
00:28:43,444 --> 00:28:44,560
You know, um...

389
00:28:45,098 --> 00:28:47,948
I had my first performance right here, just for Nathan.

390
00:28:50,678 --> 00:28:52,670
Have you talked to him since he left for camp?

391
00:28:53,182 --> 00:28:57,503
No, he never picked up, so I wrote letters.

392
00:29:14,257 --> 00:29:15,530
Are you awake?

393
00:29:16,785 --> 00:29:17,840
Yeah.

394
00:29:19,097 --> 00:29:21,280
Will you talk to me, please?

395
00:29:22,459 --> 00:29:24,619
I don't know what to say to you, Haley.

396
00:29:25,931 --> 00:29:29,632
And part of me just wants to find the right words to hurt you...

397
00:29:30,968 --> 00:29:32,694
the same way you hurt me.

398
00:29:33,374 --> 00:29:35,330
I am hurting, Nathan.

399
00:29:37,942 --> 00:29:40,219
You mean, because I made out with Chris?

400
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:44,167
Because I turned my back on us and walked away?

401
00:29:44,545 --> 00:29:47,382
Oh, wait, that was you.

402
00:29:50,939 --> 00:29:52,882
Always and forever.

403
00:29:54,371 --> 00:29:55,333
What?

404
00:29:59,673 --> 00:30:00,946
Nothing.

405
00:30:04,416 --> 00:30:05,384
Hales?

406
00:30:07,714 --> 00:30:11,298
Nathan, please, I just want to talk to you.

407
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:14,766
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

408
00:30:18,851 --> 00:30:20,520
Haley, I can't do this.

409
00:30:21,042 --> 00:30:23,878
I'm sorry. You need to go, all right?

410
00:30:24,980 --> 00:30:26,208
Please.

411
00:30:40,550 --> 00:30:42,070
I understand...

412
00:30:43,274 --> 00:30:45,352
if you don't love me anymore.

413
00:30:53,336 --> 00:30:54,782
Always and forever.

414
00:30:56,903 --> 00:30:58,552
That's what sucks, Haley.

415
00:31:00,158 --> 00:31:01,972
I still do love you.

416
00:31:03,355 --> 00:31:04,901
I always will.

417
00:31:09,380 --> 00:31:11,111
I just can't trust you.

418
00:31:29,297 --> 00:31:30,244
Dan?

419
00:31:32,263 --> 00:31:33,675
You found the papers?

420
00:31:43,014 --> 00:31:44,913
These are our divorce papers, Deb.

421
00:31:44,995 --> 00:31:46,405
You've recovered,

422
00:31:46,850 --> 00:31:48,258
and so have I,

423
00:31:48,344 --> 00:31:50,970
but our marriage isn't going to.

424
00:31:52,179 --> 00:31:53,852
It's time to end it.

425
00:32:01,255 --> 00:32:04,384
"But if he could once return to that certain starting place

426
00:32:04,544 --> 00:32:08,261
and go over it all slowly, perhaps he could find that thing he was missing. "

427
00:32:11,425 --> 00:32:13,314
A divorce is fine, Deb.

428
00:32:17,103 --> 00:32:18,619
You seem surprised.

429
00:32:21,297 --> 00:32:24,952
But I guess, at a certain point, the fire burns out.

430
00:32:31,941 --> 00:32:33,655
I think I'll go for a walk.

431
00:32:47,617 --> 00:32:50,476
How much for a broken heart with a side of regret?

432
00:32:50,519 --> 00:32:52,586
Um... more than you want to know.

433
00:32:54,761 --> 00:32:57,285
So, when you're done here, bring your stuff to the apartment.

434
00:32:57,302 --> 00:32:58,038
Why?

435
00:32:58,105 --> 00:32:59,646
Because you're moving in with me.

436
00:33:01,817 --> 00:33:03,828
why would you do that?

437
00:33:03,897 --> 00:33:06,261
Because you need a place to live and I need rent money

438
00:33:06,312 --> 00:33:08,457
to pay for my newback-to-school wardrobe.

439
00:33:08,508 --> 00:33:12,267
So the way I see it, you move in, I look hot, you don't get crabs at a shelter.

440
00:33:12,349 --> 00:33:13,541
Works for me.

441
00:33:23,352 --> 00:33:26,633
The whole summer, and I still can't get used to that hair of yours.

442
00:33:26,706 --> 00:33:27,730
What?!

443
00:33:27,812 --> 00:33:31,141
You did yours last spring, and mine actually looks good.

444
00:33:31,211 --> 00:33:32,092
Hey!

445
00:33:32,209 --> 00:33:37,816
Plus, Ellie had the whole long-hair thing, and I don't want to look anything like her.

446
00:33:38,358 --> 00:33:42,777
I met her once before I knew who she was.

447
00:33:43,704 --> 00:33:45,553
You haven't heard from her all summer?

448
00:33:46,229 --> 00:33:48,898
No, not since I slammed the door in her face.

449
00:33:49,166 --> 00:33:51,819
The weird e-mails stopped coming?

450
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:53,155
Yeah.

451
00:33:53,832 --> 00:33:54,943
Why?

452
00:33:56,147 --> 00:33:58,623
She's back, Peyton -- Ellie.

453
00:33:59,402 --> 00:34:00,898
I saw her today.

454
00:34:05,337 --> 00:34:06,474
Yo, big time.

455
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:08,526
Gonna see you at that party, right?

456
00:34:08,624 --> 00:34:10,231
Maybe, we'll see.

457
00:34:10,314 --> 00:34:11,547
"Maybe, we'll see?"

458
00:34:11,727 --> 00:34:16,241
All right, but if you don't show up, I might booty-call that girl that sent you that letter.

459
00:34:16,314 --> 00:34:18,024
All right, all right.

460
00:34:20,251 --> 00:34:21,495
Hey, yo, Nate,

461
00:34:22,611 --> 00:34:24,946
you can't get it all back at once, man.

462
00:34:25,079 --> 00:34:27,946
Take it slow. Give it some time.

463
00:34:28,141 --> 00:34:30,466
Pretty soon, you'll be back, better than ever.

464
00:34:30,828 --> 00:34:31,781
All right?

465
00:34:31,881 --> 00:34:32,820
All right.

466
00:34:33,645 --> 00:34:34,787
Catch you later.

467
00:35:16,956 --> 00:35:18,435
Okay, here's the deal.

468
00:35:18,511 --> 00:35:22,087
I got room for you but not a lot of pity. You did what you did, and it's done.

469
00:35:22,295 --> 00:35:23,534
Take it or leave it.

470
00:35:23,915 --> 00:35:25,496
I'll take it.

471
00:35:26,427 --> 00:35:27,660
All right.

472
00:35:28,025 --> 00:35:29,643
Come on in, roommate.

473
00:35:56,231 --> 00:35:59,395
- May the grace of God be --
- Yeah, okay.

474
00:36:00,296 --> 00:36:03,859
I got to tell you, padre, this isn't exactly my home court, you know.

475
00:36:04,285 --> 00:36:06,348
Never had much use for religion.

476
00:36:06,881 --> 00:36:09,804
I guess what you call kindness, I call weakness.

477
00:36:11,421 --> 00:36:15,769
But... no man is bullet proof. I know that.

478
00:36:16,773 --> 00:36:19,604
After all, they crucified your boy, didn't they?

479
00:36:19,951 --> 00:36:21,877
What troubles you, my son?

480
00:36:25,047 --> 00:36:28,676
What me troubles me is how I've made mistakes...

481
00:36:31,148 --> 00:36:34,473
...how I lie awake at night, keeping company with regret,

482
00:36:34,632 --> 00:36:36,301
fallibility.

483
00:36:37,893 --> 00:36:40,360
I've not been the man I intended to be.

484
00:36:41,194 --> 00:36:42,751
That troubles me.

485
00:36:43,592 --> 00:36:46,059
And you've come seeking absolution?

486
00:36:47,601 --> 00:36:51,062
Yeah, I suppose I have.

487
00:36:53,053 --> 00:36:54,998
Let me ask you something.

488
00:36:55,808 --> 00:37:00,093
Is it possible to grant forgiveness for sinful acts yet to be committed?

489
00:37:00,344 --> 00:37:02,654
I'm afraid I don't understand.

490
00:37:07,051 --> 00:37:08,777
It's simple, really.

491
00:37:11,389 --> 00:37:14,168
Three months ago, someone tried to kill me.

492
00:37:16,257 --> 00:37:18,306
They drugged me and left me for dead.

493
00:37:21,091 --> 00:37:23,445
I pretended not to remember.

494
00:37:31,213 --> 00:37:35,985
But, in fact, every night since, I've tried to piece it together.

495
00:37:36,870 --> 00:37:40,659
And when I find out who did this to me -- and I will find out soon...

496
00:37:41,935 --> 00:37:45,160
...the sins I commit then could turn this place to rubble.

497
00:37:53,367 --> 00:37:55,774
Aren't you afraid of swimming alone?

498
00:37:55,872 --> 00:37:58,319
Well, beats being alone on land.

499
00:37:58,687 --> 00:37:59,804
Looking for me?

500
00:37:59,891 --> 00:38:01,149
Sort of.

501
00:38:01,401 --> 00:38:02,487
How come?

502
00:38:02,620 --> 00:38:05,706
I just want to know if you want to hang out, grab some food.

503
00:38:06,301 --> 00:38:08,175
Keep it casual.

504
00:38:08,445 --> 00:38:10,126
Casual is good.

505
00:38:10,689 --> 00:38:11,666
Have a seat.

506
00:38:24,456 --> 00:38:26,239
This is gonna work, right?

507
00:38:26,745 --> 00:38:27,748
What's that?

508
00:38:27,847 --> 00:38:31,650
Us dating, nothing serious.

509
00:38:32,571 --> 00:38:34,256
It's working for me.

510
00:38:34,348 --> 00:38:35,444
How about you?

511
00:38:36,401 --> 00:38:37,922
Absolutely.

512
00:38:38,526 --> 00:38:39,669
It's good.

513
00:38:43,037 --> 00:38:45,600
So, when are we gonna get to that kissing part anyway?

514
00:38:45,643 --> 00:38:46,671
Oh...

515
00:38:47,144 --> 00:38:49,990
I'd say right about now if you know what's good for you.

516
00:39:44,342 --> 00:39:55,132
At this moment, there are 6, 470, 818, 671 people in the world.

517
00:40:02,858 --> 00:40:05,546
Some are running scared.

518
00:40:18,882 --> 00:40:21,285
Some are coming home.

519
00:40:28,398 --> 00:40:31,230
Some tell lies to make it through the day.

520
00:40:37,206 --> 00:40:40,034
Others are just now facing the truth.

521
00:40:46,025 --> 00:40:49,415
Some are evil men, at war with good.

522
00:41:04,205 --> 00:41:07,838
And some are good, struggling with evil.

523
00:41:17,027 --> 00:41:19,950
Six billion people in the world.

524
00:41:22,675 --> 00:41:25,015
Six billion souls.

525
00:41:27,324 --> 00:41:28,931
And sometimes...

526
00:41:31,092 --> 00:41:32,920
...all you need is one.
