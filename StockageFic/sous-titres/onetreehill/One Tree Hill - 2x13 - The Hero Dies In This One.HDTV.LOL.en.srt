1
00:00:00,623 --> 00:00:02,248
Previously on One Tree Hill.

2
00:00:02,329 --> 00:00:04,492
I’m the one who did it. I broke her windshield.

3
00:00:04,992 --> 00:00:07,681
When I got off the bus, I saw Haley kissing some guy.

4
00:00:07,768 --> 00:00:11,895
He was kinda scrawny, had a guitar case, sort of… hell-t hair.

5
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:20,521
I took the test.

6
00:00:22,563 --> 00:00:23,957
We’ll know in a couple of days.

7
00:00:25,784 --> 00:00:27,536
Thank you, thank you.

8
00:00:29,784 --> 00:00:31,590
I’m just... I’m tired of running, Peyton.

9
00:00:32,573 --> 00:00:33,388
Come with me.

10
00:00:34,402 --> 00:00:35,596
Let’s bring Jenny back home.

11
00:00:36,833 --> 00:00:38,242
Something happened tonight.

12
00:00:39,353 --> 00:00:40,786
I asked her to marry me.

13
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:43,516
You and I are the only ones who know the truth about Jules.

14
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:45,373
And I’m willing to keep it a secret.

15
00:00:45,502 --> 00:00:46,525
What do you want from me?

16
00:00:47,474 --> 00:00:49,034
I’m sure we can work something out.

17
00:01:42,423 --> 00:01:43,901
I think the Latin book’s upside-down.

18
00:01:44,012 --> 00:01:46,010
Like I could read it if it was right-side-up.

19
00:01:47,742 --> 00:01:49,845
How long’s it gonna take you to get these fliers done?

20
00:01:50,229 --> 00:01:52,400
Just gotta download the pics to my computer.

21
00:01:52,641 --> 00:01:53,706
You got a slogan in mind?

22
00:01:53,957 --> 00:01:56,455
Yeah, ‘Brooke Davis for President’.

23
00:01:56,554 --> 00:01:58,672
Short enough for even the stoners to remember.

24
00:02:05,494 --> 00:02:06,859
You gonna leave Keith and Jules alone?

25
00:02:07,335 --> 00:02:08,707
I’m thinking about it.

26
00:02:09,082 --> 00:02:10,437
He’s happy for once.

27
00:02:11,018 --> 00:02:13,197
He’s getting married. Don’t screw that up.

28
00:02:14,145 --> 00:02:15,302
They’re getting married?

29
00:02:18,645 --> 00:02:20,995
I’ll tell you what – I’ll leave them alone…

30
00:02:21,683 --> 00:02:23,980
if you give me a chance to prove that I can be a good father.

31
00:02:24,263 --> 00:02:25,777
Well, how you gonna do that, huh?

32
00:02:26,073 --> 00:02:27,345
Get a lobotomy?

33
00:02:28,217 --> 00:02:28,963
No.

34
00:02:30,961 --> 00:02:32,347
You move in with me.

35
00:02:41,489 --> 00:02:45,184
Haley, we seriously have to hide the matches from your pyro sister.

36
00:02:45,804 --> 00:02:49,269
Be grateful it’s just candles. When we were kids, I set fire to our bunk beds.

37
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:53,047
Look… where is Haley and, does she know that you’re wearing her shirt?

38
00:02:53,216 --> 00:02:56,456
At school and no, I needed a beach cover-up.

39
00:02:56,549 --> 00:02:59,458
Hey, I borrowed some cash, for beer, I hope you don’t mind.

40
00:03:03,568 --> 00:03:05,464
And, she left the computer on.

41
00:03:07,387 --> 00:03:08,643
Love having you, Taylor.

42
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:10,153
Come visit anytime.

43
00:03:11,402 --> 00:03:13,645
'Got your message. Don’t think I can leave you alone.'

44
00:03:19,912 --> 00:03:24,189
'Miss you... Thinking of you... I want to kiss you.'

45
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:33,291
Hey, Luke. I’m taking a poll for the next issue of the paper.

46
00:03:33,537 --> 00:03:37,091
What is your biggest concern for the upcoming student government election?

47
00:03:37,127 --> 00:03:38,564
Having to answer polls.

48
00:03:38,774 --> 00:03:42,333
Well, well, well. If it isn’t my favourite two voters in the same place.

49
00:03:42,486 --> 00:03:46,512
You two can be the first to know I’m running for president. Do I have your support?

50
00:03:46,839 --> 00:03:47,997
Well, do I have any choice?

51
00:03:48,082 --> 00:03:49,717
Ah, let me think about that – no.

52
00:03:49,963 --> 00:03:52,087
And if you’re still doing you newspaper dig, Mighty Mouth,

53
00:03:52,148 --> 00:03:54,069
I’ll give you an exclusive on my campaign.

54
00:03:54,155 --> 00:03:57,330
- Um… yeah, we should set that up.
- Good.

55
00:03:58,309 --> 00:03:59,393
You guys seen Haley?

56
00:03:59,676 --> 00:04:01,492
Uh… I think she’s tutoring.

57
00:04:02,226 --> 00:04:02,926
You okay?

58
00:04:03,475 --> 00:04:04,323
I gotta go.

59
00:04:05,876 --> 00:04:06,531
Alright.

60
00:04:06,942 --> 00:04:09,997
- No way. Is that… Jake?
- What?

61
00:04:12,198 --> 00:04:13,007
Hey!

62
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:16,145
- When’d you get back?
- Couple days ago.

63
00:04:16,249 --> 00:04:17,201
How’s Jenny?.

64
00:04:17,395 --> 00:04:18,486
- Hey.
- Hi.

65
00:04:18,578 --> 00:04:20,191
She’s great. She’s getting bigger every day.

66
00:04:21,425 --> 00:04:24,062
You’re getting scrawny, man. You better hit that weight room before camp.

67
00:04:24,153 --> 00:04:24,953
Yeah.

68
00:04:25,117 --> 00:04:26,607
Will you still be here then?

69
00:04:26,728 --> 00:04:28,618
Yeah, yeah. I’m back for good now.

70
00:04:28,833 --> 00:04:30,205
I mean, I got some messes to clean up.

71
00:04:30,263 --> 00:04:35,001
I gotta get a lawyer; see if I can… keep Nikki away, but… I’m done running.

72
00:04:35,489 --> 00:04:36,309
Good.

73
00:04:36,893 --> 00:04:37,886
We need you here.

74
00:04:38,863 --> 00:04:39,739
Thanks.

75
00:04:41,097 --> 00:04:44,486
Oh, Jake, I’m so glad you came back. You can still vote here, right?

76
00:04:46,205 --> 00:04:48,301
- You good?
- Yes.

77
00:04:49,067 --> 00:04:50,886
Thank you, for calling him.

78
00:04:52,541 --> 00:04:54,101
You’re a good friend, Luke.

79
00:05:03,087 --> 00:05:06,701
Hey. I heard you were out of town. Fill me in on all the dirt.

80
00:05:06,804 --> 00:05:08,652
I… think you’re the only one who has any.

81
00:05:09,594 --> 00:05:12,954
- Um… I have to ask you something.
- Yeah.

82
00:05:13,558 --> 00:05:15,272
Did you kiss Chris?

83
00:05:20,612 --> 00:05:22,127
How did you know about that?

84
00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:24,784
That is seriously not important.

85
00:05:24,852 --> 00:05:27,079
- It was, like, a goodbye kiss.
- With tongue?

86
00:05:28,508 --> 00:05:30,269
Haley, what’s going on with you?

87
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:34,079
You know how ugly everything got with me and Brooke and Lucas and…

88
00:05:34,314 --> 00:05:36,203
there were no wedding rings in that scenario.

89
00:05:36,505 --> 00:05:40,182
Look, he just… he just kissed me.

90
00:05:41,298 --> 00:05:44,850
And… I let him and it was a really stupid thing to do.

91
00:05:45,005 --> 00:05:48,512
But… It’s-it didn’t mean anything, you know?

92
00:05:51,011 --> 00:05:52,593
A kiss always means something.

93
00:06:06,605 --> 00:06:10,886
Well, I never though I’d see you darken my door again, Jagielski.

94
00:06:11,101 --> 00:06:13,139
Yeah, I wasn’t so sure myself, coach.

95
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,972
Where the hell’ve you been, son?

96
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:19,299
Just looking for a safe place in a non-safe world.

97
00:06:19,847 --> 00:06:20,903
You find it?

98
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:22,423
I don’t think it exists.

99
00:06:23,272 --> 00:06:25,299
So I figured I’d just have to create it myself.

100
00:06:26,068 --> 00:06:27,292
How’s your game?

101
00:06:28,187 --> 00:06:30,609
Well, haven’t had much cause to use it.

102
00:06:32,969 --> 00:06:34,489
How bout your grades?

103
00:06:35,637 --> 00:06:38,186
Well, I’ve been working a lot of hours; just to keep me and Jenny afloat

104
00:06:38,242 --> 00:06:40,050
so I sorta stopped going to school.

105
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:42,180
That’s a damn fools plan.

106
00:06:43,414 --> 00:06:47,208
Jenny deserves a whole lot better than a high school drop-out for a father.

107
00:06:47,269 --> 00:06:48,544
I know, I know. That’s why I’m here.

108
00:06:48,616 --> 00:06:51,853
I was hoping that you could speak to Principle Turner on my behalf coz…

109
00:06:52,624 --> 00:06:55,154
well he wasn’t really happy last time I talked to him.

110
00:06:56,393 --> 00:06:57,894
You gonna disappear again?

111
00:06:58,252 --> 00:06:59,649
I don’t plan on it, coach.

112
00:07:03,009 --> 00:07:04,979
We got a faculty meeting tonight.

113
00:07:05,133 --> 00:07:07,376
I’ll corner Turner and see what I can do.

114
00:07:07,714 --> 00:07:08,773
I appreciate that.

115
00:07:09,188 --> 00:07:11,697
Oh, and about that safe place you’re building;

116
00:07:12,158 --> 00:07:13,750
don’t do it alone.

117
00:07:14,296 --> 00:07:16,746
There’s a lot of people here ready to help.

118
00:07:25,706 --> 00:07:26,909
Talk to your folks lately?

119
00:07:27,242 --> 00:07:29,524
Uh, yeah actually, my mom sent me an email.

120
00:07:29,593 --> 00:07:33,436
Said dad is dragging em all over Wisconsin looking for, like, the Gouda museum or something.

121
00:07:34,317 --> 00:07:35,310
What about Chris?

122
00:07:37,292 --> 00:07:38,767
Did you go through my emails?

123
00:07:39,498 --> 00:07:40,779
What is this, Haley?

124
00:07:40,937 --> 00:07:44,178
Nothing. I sent him one email to say good luck on your music.

125
00:07:44,365 --> 00:07:46,503
It looks like more than one email to me.

126
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:50,747
Taylor, must have sent these on my account because...

127
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:52,965
Yeah, look at the dates; They all start after she got here.

128
00:07:53,062 --> 00:07:55,094
And this one was sent when I was at the café.

129
00:07:55,806 --> 00:07:57,147
So you didn’t kiss Chris?

130
00:07:58,602 --> 00:08:01,607
Taylor is just stirring up trouble like always.

131
00:08:02,109 --> 00:08:06,399
Okay. I’m gonna tell her to leave then. That cool with you?

132
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:11,396
Yeah. She should go.

133
00:08:12,743 --> 00:08:13,465
Alright.

134
00:08:19,877 --> 00:08:21,621
Good afternoon folks.

135
00:08:23,142 --> 00:08:26,686
Welcome to the first student government information session.

136
00:08:26,777 --> 00:08:30,526
I’m gonna pass out these sign-up sheets for the various offices.

137
00:08:30,592 --> 00:08:34,432
And once you’ve filled these out we’ll talk about scheduling.

138
00:08:35,052 --> 00:08:35,747
Hi.

139
00:08:36,092 --> 00:08:37,110
Erica Marsh.

140
00:08:37,893 --> 00:08:40,387
I never pegged Brooke Davis for student government.

141
00:08:40,551 --> 00:08:43,290
Well, I am captain of the cheerleading squad…

142
00:08:43,428 --> 00:08:45,932
and a former homecoming queen. Can’t be that different, right?

143
00:08:46,034 --> 00:08:49,516
Actually, government is a lot more than just a popularity contest.

144
00:08:49,665 --> 00:08:54,211
Everybody, in this room, has at least a 3.8 GPA and a tonne of outside interest.

145
00:08:54,293 --> 00:08:56,980
Take me; I’m president of the National Auto Society;

146
00:08:57,053 --> 00:08:59,771
head of the French club and co-chair of Tree Hill Big Sisters.

147
00:08:59,864 --> 00:09:04,344
Wow. You do all of that and yet you still have time to talk to us little people?

148
00:09:04,435 --> 00:09:05,787
Maybe I can help you, Brooke.

149
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:07,580
Have you thought about running for secretary?

150
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:09,668
Nobody serious ever wants that job.

151
00:09:09,745 --> 00:09:12,377
Actually, I’m running for president.

152
00:09:12,525 --> 00:09:13,422
President?

153
00:09:13,807 --> 00:09:15,857
You realise I’ve been president since seventh grade.

154
00:09:15,925 --> 00:09:16,739
Really?

155
00:09:17,102 --> 00:09:18,147
What’s was your name again?

156
00:09:18,489 --> 00:09:19,524
Erica Marsh.

157
00:09:20,692 --> 00:09:22,786
No, doesn’t ring a bell.

158
00:09:22,885 --> 00:09:24,399
Don’t worry, it will.

159
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:26,867
Will be in one, Vivica.

160
00:09:27,516 --> 00:09:28,398
Erica.

161
00:09:29,038 --> 00:09:29,929
Whatever.

162
00:09:38,843 --> 00:09:41,581
- Oh, hey.
- Oh, hey. You’re a lifesaver.

163
00:09:42,001 --> 00:09:45,156
Deb’s out of town and I’m backed up on deliveries.

164
00:09:45,319 --> 00:09:48,980
Okay, uh… no problem, I’ll pack up the car. But first…

165
00:09:49,523 --> 00:09:51,116
the test results came.

166
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:53,000
I don’t have HCM.

167
00:09:54,064 --> 00:09:55,222
Keith’s okay too.

168
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:57,449
Thank god.

169
00:09:58,155 --> 00:10:00,905
Oh, I don’t think I could take it if anything were wrong with you.

170
00:10:01,949 --> 00:10:02,727
I know.

171
00:10:02,887 --> 00:10:05,353
Well, we should celebrate; anything you want.

172
00:10:06,848 --> 00:10:08,645
I wanna… move in with Dan.

173
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:12,389
Right, and I wanna drive metal spike into my eyes.

174
00:10:14,714 --> 00:10:17,703
Look, I know it sounds crazy, okay.

175
00:10:17,801 --> 00:10:19,921
But college is gonna start in a few years...

176
00:10:20,002 --> 00:10:21,035
You’re serious?

177
00:10:23,406 --> 00:10:24,272
Yeah.

178
00:10:25,993 --> 00:10:27,698
I wanna move in with Dan.

179
00:10:28,271 --> 00:10:30,094
Over my dead body.

180
00:10:30,914 --> 00:10:32,684
What’s this really about, Lucas?

181
00:10:32,845 --> 00:10:33,878
What’s going on?

182
00:10:33,970 --> 00:10:34,842
Nothing.

183
00:10:36,191 --> 00:10:38,385
And I know this comes as a surprise to you…

184
00:10:38,976 --> 00:10:43,662
and I’m sorry mom, but… it’s what I want. Okay?

185
00:10:51,414 --> 00:10:52,283
You’re late!

186
00:10:52,551 --> 00:10:53,493
Where the hell were you?

187
00:10:53,728 --> 00:10:55,352
I… stopped by to check on Jules.

188
00:10:55,433 --> 00:10:57,922
You should have called. Your office, right now.

189
00:11:02,673 --> 00:11:03,886
Surprise!

190
00:11:04,751 --> 00:11:05,319
What...?

191
00:11:05,857 --> 00:11:07,322
Congratulations, big brother.

192
00:11:07,886 --> 00:11:10,322
I hope Jules makes you as happy as Deb has made me.

193
00:11:10,855 --> 00:11:12,308
But, how did you know?

194
00:11:12,452 --> 00:11:14,142
Good news travels fast in this town.

195
00:11:15,126 --> 00:11:17,132
A toast; to Keith and to Jules.

196
00:11:17,278 --> 00:11:19,287
Two people lucky enough to find each other.

197
00:11:19,574 --> 00:11:23,061
And I hope your lives together… are filled with many more surprises.

198
00:11:23,399 --> 00:11:27,593
Oh no, this is just about the number of people we’re inviting to the wedding, so…

199
00:11:27,757 --> 00:11:28,898
What’re you talking about?

200
00:11:28,995 --> 00:11:31,341
Oh, you know, we’re just gonna… do something small.

201
00:11:31,442 --> 00:11:33,608
Out of the question. You deserve a big blow-out.

202
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,612
No expense spared. It’s my gift.

203
00:11:35,693 --> 00:11:38,190
I wanna give you a day you’ll remember for the rest of your life.

204
00:11:38,313 --> 00:11:39,680
Besides, it’s not for you.

205
00:11:41,441 --> 00:11:45,046
It’s for Jules. Every woman deserves to be a queen for the day.

206
00:11:47,207 --> 00:11:48,943
What the hell are you doing with Lucas?!

207
00:11:49,030 --> 00:11:49,844
So he told you?

208
00:11:49,973 --> 00:11:52,455
Only that he’s moving in with you, not the real reason why!

209
00:11:52,526 --> 00:11:53,817
He wants to get to know his father.

210
00:11:53,890 --> 00:11:56,945
That’s crap and we both know it. You’re manipulating him somehow!

211
00:11:57,022 --> 00:11:59,807
No, I’m letting him make a choice. He’s a big boy, Karen.

212
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:01,640
He may need something more than just his mommy.

213
00:12:01,717 --> 00:12:05,020
Don't you dare walk away from me, we are nowhere near finished...

214
00:12:08,445 --> 00:12:09,336
What’s going on?

215
00:12:09,418 --> 00:12:11,890
It’s just a little party to celebrate Keith’s engagement.

216
00:12:15,224 --> 00:12:16,304
Champaign?

217
00:12:20,002 --> 00:12:20,718
Hey.

218
00:12:23,206 --> 00:12:23,995
Hey.

219
00:12:24,143 --> 00:12:27,287
So… Nathan found out that I kissed Chris.

220
00:12:27,446 --> 00:12:28,198
You told him?

221
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:31,834
No, my idiot sister has been emailing Chris under my screen name because, apparently,

222
00:12:31,889 --> 00:12:34,941
the drama in her own life isn’t enough, and Nathan found the emails.

223
00:12:35,013 --> 00:12:36,048
How’d he take it?

224
00:12:36,165 --> 00:12:38,141
I just told him Taylor made it all up.

225
00:12:38,259 --> 00:12:40,814
So… you lied to him, again?

226
00:12:41,511 --> 00:12:44,649
Yeah, and I feel awful about it, but what’s the point of telling Nathan?

227
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:47,513
Chris is out of my life, okay?

228
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:49,973
Nathan would feel worse if he knew the truth.

229
00:12:51,105 --> 00:12:53,092
What is the truth?

230
00:12:53,579 --> 00:12:56,859
That Chris… and I are connected through music.

231
00:12:58,062 --> 00:13:00,578
He understands that part of me in a way that Nathan doesn’t.

232
00:13:00,638 --> 00:13:03,967
Okay, Haley, if… if Chris were in town…

233
00:13:04,259 --> 00:13:07,495
would you be into him? Coz I mean you... kissed him.

234
00:13:07,581 --> 00:13:09,707
I know I kissed him and it was a mistake.

235
00:13:09,823 --> 00:13:12,277
So this whole connection is strictly music?

236
00:13:12,373 --> 00:13:13,490
That’s all it is.

237
00:13:13,596 --> 00:13:14,627
I love Nathan.

238
00:13:23,287 --> 00:13:25,763
So I guess... congratulations are in order.

239
00:13:25,871 --> 00:13:29,582
I’m sorry about this morning. That’s not how I wanted you to find out.

240
00:13:30,038 --> 00:13:31,584
Why didn’t you just tell me?

241
00:13:32,004 --> 00:13:34,216
You know, for as long as I can remember, Karen,

242
00:13:35,542 --> 00:13:36,997
I wanted to be with you.

243
00:13:37,472 --> 00:13:39,178
- And then I proposed...
- Keith.

244
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:41,758
No, really, it’s… it’s okay.

245
00:13:42,255 --> 00:13:47,277
When you turned me down, I… I thought I’d never have any love in my life.

246
00:13:49,229 --> 00:13:51,395
But now I’ve found the love of my life.

247
00:13:54,676 --> 00:13:56,540
Jules is a lucky woman.

248
00:13:56,664 --> 00:13:58,716
I guess I didn’t tell you because...

249
00:13:59,837 --> 00:14:01,603
I needed to say this first;

250
00:14:03,098 --> 00:14:05,116
I’m glad I loved you all those years.

251
00:14:05,843 --> 00:14:07,696
You know, even if it didn’t work out.

252
00:14:08,817 --> 00:14:10,420
My heart knew what it wanted.

253
00:14:11,189 --> 00:14:12,989
So I was ready when Jules came along.

254
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:18,290
Did you guys set a date yet?

255
00:14:19,457 --> 00:14:21,202
No, it’ll be soon though.

256
00:14:22,338 --> 00:14:24,679
Lucas has already agreed to be my best man.

257
00:14:24,777 --> 00:14:27,209
Really? I didn’t know.

258
00:14:28,247 --> 00:14:32,032
We haven’t talked about anything but Dan since Lucas asked to move in with him.

259
00:14:32,251 --> 00:14:33,511
Hang on, what?

260
00:14:33,604 --> 00:14:36,134
Yeah, there’s something going on that he’s not telling me.

261
00:14:41,291 --> 00:14:42,113
Hey.

262
00:14:42,737 --> 00:14:45,399
Hey. Like my new campaign posters?

263
00:14:45,513 --> 00:14:48,205
- I have never seen you looking so...
- Presidential?

264
00:14:48,702 --> 00:14:49,594
Funereal.

265
00:14:50,275 --> 00:14:54,624
Funny word coming from you; miss happy, goofy grin queen.

266
00:14:54,908 --> 00:14:56,665
What’s going on with you and Jake anyway?

267
00:14:56,763 --> 00:14:59,752
I don’t know, stop! We’re playing it by the ear.

268
00:15:00,034 --> 00:15:01,323
Is that all you’re playing?

269
00:15:02,266 --> 00:15:08,216
Okay, fine, don’t tell us. I’ll just keep my fingers crossed and expect juicy details later.

270
00:15:10,043 --> 00:15:12,438
'Want a President with a 2.3 GPA?'

271
00:15:12,608 --> 00:15:14,602
'Brooke Davis Skipped 4TH Period 30 Times Last Year!'

272
00:15:14,703 --> 00:15:15,825
Who did that?

273
00:15:16,015 --> 00:15:19,675
In our great democracy, anyone can run for president.

274
00:15:19,812 --> 00:15:22,035
But you deserve a leader you can trust.

275
00:15:22,151 --> 00:15:26,221
I have evidence that Brooke Davis stuffed the ballot box to win homecoming queen.

276
00:15:28,828 --> 00:15:32,192
I knocked it over by accident! I was just putting the ballots back in!

277
00:15:32,284 --> 00:15:34,558
And that might not be all she stuffs.

278
00:15:36,641 --> 00:15:41,845
Oh, please, I haven’t stuffed since puberty. I can’t believe that little bitch went negative.

279
00:15:41,956 --> 00:15:43,784
I can’t believe she beat you to it.

280
00:15:44,051 --> 00:15:46,498
This election, choose honesty;

281
00:15:46,599 --> 00:15:48,934
vote for me – Erica Marsh.

282
00:15:57,754 --> 00:15:59,569
Little frosty in here, today, no?

283
00:15:59,844 --> 00:16:01,832
You here to eat or give a weather report?

284
00:16:03,332 --> 00:16:05,325
Okay, what’s going on?

285
00:16:05,417 --> 00:16:08,207
I thought Lucas took the HCM test and was fine.

286
00:16:08,314 --> 00:16:10,557
Yeah, but now he wants to move in with Dan…

287
00:16:10,635 --> 00:16:13,199
and I haven’t been able to get him to budge so I’m gonna get Keith to try.

288
00:16:13,271 --> 00:16:13,988
Keith.

289
00:16:14,091 --> 00:16:15,513
Who’s getting married to Jules.

290
00:16:16,757 --> 00:16:17,935
Wow, that’s great.

291
00:16:18,011 --> 00:16:20,424
Is it? I mean, how well does he know this girl?

292
00:16:20,654 --> 00:16:23,404
What if he’s just blinded by a pretty face and a hot body?

293
00:16:23,557 --> 00:16:25,428
Well, some would say the same about you.

294
00:16:29,096 --> 00:16:31,386
You can’t let Erica get away with smearing you like that.

295
00:16:31,463 --> 00:16:33,542
You leave this stuff unanswered, it becomes the truth.

296
00:16:35,062 --> 00:16:37,769
So what do you think I should do about Erica’s ads?

297
00:16:38,027 --> 00:16:40,192
Uh… are they true?

298
00:16:40,975 --> 00:16:41,942
Some of them.

299
00:16:42,287 --> 00:16:45,220
Well don’t deny it. Politicians always get caught when they lie.

300
00:16:45,369 --> 00:16:46,530
That’s brilliant, genius.

301
00:16:46,970 --> 00:16:48,409
Stick to slinging hash.

302
00:16:49,674 --> 00:16:51,416
Look, people like you, Brooke.

303
00:16:51,902 --> 00:16:53,341
Just be who you are.

304
00:16:54,324 --> 00:16:57,938
Okay, it’s official, Michelle Branch and Jessica Harp are playing at TRIC tomorrow!

305
00:16:58,019 --> 00:16:58,886
- No way!
- Yes!

306
00:16:58,987 --> 00:16:59,935
That’s awesome!

307
00:17:00,472 --> 00:17:03,146
That will be perfect for my campaign launch party!

308
00:17:03,226 --> 00:17:04,037
Yeah!

309
00:17:04,967 --> 00:17:06,110
Wait, what?

310
00:17:09,102 --> 00:17:11,655
Hey, can you… zip me up, brother?

311
00:17:14,137 --> 00:17:15,479
You’re busted, Taylor.

312
00:17:16,002 --> 00:17:18,173
I’ll take that for a no.

313
00:17:19,525 --> 00:17:20,671
Where the hell have you been?

314
00:17:21,388 --> 00:17:23,703
I met some people at the beach and we partied all night.

315
00:17:23,813 --> 00:17:24,890
What’s your problem?

316
00:17:25,008 --> 00:17:27,993
I know you pretended to be Haley and emailed Chris.

317
00:17:28,843 --> 00:17:31,208
And what kind of a sister does something that twisted?

318
00:17:31,870 --> 00:17:35,294
The kind who’s hoping the baby of the family doesn’t screw up like she did.

319
00:17:35,386 --> 00:17:38,300
Oh, right. Is that why you made up all that stuff about a kiss?

320
00:17:38,674 --> 00:17:39,969
You think I made it up?

321
00:17:41,141 --> 00:17:43,963
I talked to Haley. There was no kiss.

322
00:17:45,222 --> 00:17:47,980
Make whatever phone calls you need to find a place to crash.

323
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:49,219
You’re outta here.

324
00:18:01,437 --> 00:18:04,603
I was beginning to think you’d skipped town and left all your stuff.

325
00:18:04,806 --> 00:18:06,357
What do you care if I haven’t been around?

326
00:18:06,547 --> 00:18:07,878
You’re kicking me out, right?

327
00:18:07,955 --> 00:18:10,591
Drop the attitude, Tay. You brought this on yourself.

328
00:18:10,807 --> 00:18:14,323
You’ve pulled a lot of crap over the years but emailing Chris as me…

329
00:18:15,174 --> 00:18:17,631
I just, I can’t believe you’d be such a conniving little bitch.

330
00:18:17,733 --> 00:18:21,103
Hey. You’re the bitch who’s kissing a guy that isn’t your husband.

331
00:18:21,176 --> 00:18:23,899
You need a scapegoat, fine, let Nathan think that this is all on me,

332
00:18:23,966 --> 00:18:25,824
but you and I both know the kiss happened.

333
00:18:25,927 --> 00:18:28,471
Hey! Have a Bear Claw, brother.

334
00:18:28,998 --> 00:18:30,022
We’re celebrating.

335
00:18:30,427 --> 00:18:31,660
I’m leaving tonight.

336
00:18:40,044 --> 00:18:41,987
Upgrade. I’m Dan.

337
00:18:42,218 --> 00:18:43,561
And I’m out of your league.

338
00:18:43,733 --> 00:18:44,574
Wanna bet?

339
00:18:45,045 --> 00:18:45,884
What’re you doing here?

340
00:18:47,128 --> 00:18:48,352
That’s the last of your stuff.

341
00:18:48,562 --> 00:18:50,308
Need to make some room; Lucas is moving in.

342
00:18:50,426 --> 00:18:51,992
Lucas is moving in with you?

343
00:18:52,213 --> 00:18:54,691
Yeah, guess I’m not the devil after all.

344
00:18:54,793 --> 00:18:55,960
Enjoy your breakfast.

345
00:18:59,159 --> 00:19:01,859
'Brooke Davis for President, Erica Marsh never parties this hard!'

346
00:19:03,763 --> 00:19:06,354
'Yes, Brooke Davis has a 2.3 GPA, at least she never wheats!'

347
00:19:06,477 --> 00:19:08,458
Are you implying that I cheat for my 4.0?

348
00:19:08,796 --> 00:19:10,301
Absolutely not.

349
00:19:10,434 --> 00:19:13,436
Just like you weren’t implying that I have a double digit IQ.

350
00:19:22,716 --> 00:19:23,451
Hey, Nate.

351
00:19:24,359 --> 00:19:25,176
What’s going on, man?

352
00:19:26,470 --> 00:19:27,879
Is it true you’re moving in with Dan?

353
00:19:29,234 --> 00:19:30,095
Yeah.

354
00:19:30,828 --> 00:19:31,560
Great.

355
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:34,049
What happened to ‘He can’t make me a substitute Nathan’?

356
00:19:34,525 --> 00:19:36,451
It’s just… it’s more complicated than that.

357
00:19:36,696 --> 00:19:37,756
Whatever, man.

358
00:19:38,426 --> 00:19:39,287
Lucas.

359
00:19:40,091 --> 00:19:44,049
Hey, I have to write a killer platform speech if I’m gonna win this election…

360
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:45,768
but I have no idea where to start.

361
00:19:45,886 --> 00:19:47,177
Well why don’t you try asking Felix?

362
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:49,911
Because Whitey told us to read speeches by world leaders...

363
00:19:49,987 --> 00:19:52,726
and then he mentioned this Charles Dicko guy who I thought

364
00:19:52,783 --> 00:19:55,660
was that exchange student that’s always… smelling his fingers in class…

365
00:19:55,993 --> 00:19:59,547
so obviously this is your area of expertise and not mine.

366
00:20:00,073 --> 00:20:01,082
Can you help me?

367
00:20:03,171 --> 00:20:04,800
How bout tonight, right before TRIC?

368
00:20:05,675 --> 00:20:07,364
You’re the best, Lucas. Thank you.

369
00:20:08,231 --> 00:20:10,135
Maybe I should do a contest...

370
00:20:10,533 --> 00:20:14,609
you know, ‘vote for me and win a date’ or offer a makeover.

371
00:20:17,007 --> 00:20:18,910
You don’t need a gimmick, Brooke.

372
00:20:20,253 --> 00:20:22,289
Alright, just…

373
00:20:23,155 --> 00:20:24,860
tell me why you wanna be president.

374
00:20:25,172 --> 00:20:26,508
I am who I am…

375
00:20:27,164 --> 00:20:28,572
no excuses.

376
00:20:30,355 --> 00:20:34,794
But I’d like other people to know that there’s a lot more to me than just some party-girl.

377
00:20:42,104 --> 00:20:44,344
This is from a speech, by John F. Kennedy.

378
00:20:45,575 --> 00:20:47,306
I think it could work for you.

379
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:50,665
This is all about courage.

380
00:20:52,882 --> 00:20:55,422
Nobody is gonna believe this, coming from me.

381
00:20:57,716 --> 00:20:58,647
I would.

382
00:21:07,746 --> 00:21:08,308
Hey.

383
00:21:09,717 --> 00:21:10,608
Hey.

384
00:21:11,371 --> 00:21:13,070
Brought you some campaign buttons.

385
00:21:13,235 --> 00:21:13,951
Oh.

386
00:21:15,079 --> 00:21:17,464
Wow thanks, Felix, these are great.

387
00:21:18,462 --> 00:21:20,916
Um… you wanted me to pick you up before TRIC.

388
00:21:22,353 --> 00:21:24,102
Is it that late already?

389
00:21:24,473 --> 00:21:26,050
I totally lost track of time.

390
00:21:26,111 --> 00:21:28,302
Ah, we’re done anyway.

391
00:21:34,627 --> 00:21:36,100
Everything you need to say…

392
00:21:37,145 --> 00:21:38,645
is already in your heart.

393
00:21:50,003 --> 00:21:52,751
Alright, we’re gonna go out to TRIC. Are you gonna be here when we get back?

394
00:21:53,033 --> 00:21:54,585
No. My ride’s coming tonight.

395
00:21:56,146 --> 00:21:57,328
Well where’re you gonna go?

396
00:21:57,493 --> 00:22:01,241
I… met some guy starting a surf shop down in the Keys. I’ll crash there for a while.

397
00:22:01,404 --> 00:22:02,161
And then what?

398
00:22:02,295 --> 00:22:03,944
I don’t know, Haley. I don’t think that far ahead.

399
00:22:04,025 --> 00:22:04,818
Well maybe you should.

400
00:22:04,926 --> 00:22:07,332
Like having a plan has worked so well for you.

401
00:22:11,155 --> 00:22:16,529
Well, listen... it’s not much but… here.

402
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:17,768
It’s all I’ve got.

403
00:22:18,822 --> 00:22:20,014
I want you to have it.

404
00:22:24,237 --> 00:22:25,268
Thanks…

405
00:22:27,194 --> 00:22:29,768
but this won’t make you feel any less guilty about Chris.

406
00:22:35,627 --> 00:22:38,324
- Hey.
- Are you kidding me?! DJ Bobo?

407
00:22:38,693 --> 00:22:41,576
Where are The Executioners or The Chemical Brothers or anything.

408
00:22:41,653 --> 00:22:44,386
Peyton. DJ has got this under control, okay?

409
00:22:44,787 --> 00:22:46,265
The night’s gonna be great. Come on.

410
00:22:46,644 --> 00:22:48,329
- Hey. 
- Oh, hey!

411
00:22:48,423 --> 00:22:50,392
- Welcome back.
- Where’s Nathan?

412
00:22:50,639 --> 00:22:52,865
Uh… Karen needed help with some boxes.

413
00:22:53,087 --> 00:22:55,015
Oh, well, I’ll go help them out.

414
00:22:55,195 --> 00:22:56,753
I’ve been wanting to say hi to Karen, so…

415
00:22:56,931 --> 00:22:58,037
- I’ll see ya.
- See you.

416
00:22:58,523 --> 00:22:59,711
- Hi.
- Hi.

417
00:22:59,819 --> 00:23:03,080
So… okay, this is gonna sound really weird and groupie but…

418
00:23:03,157 --> 00:23:05,926
I’m a huge Michelle Branch fan, I was wondering if you could introduce me.

419
00:23:05,999 --> 00:23:07,806
Yes, I will introduce you.

420
00:23:08,323 --> 00:23:11,877
And I would like to think so,

421
00:23:12,111 --> 00:23:15,584
But do you know that when you go

422
00:23:15,655 --> 00:23:16,956
Hey, guys, I’m sorry.

423
00:23:17,093 --> 00:23:17,714
Oh, hey.

424
00:23:17,821 --> 00:23:19,739
Um… I just wanted to introduce you to a friend of mine.

425
00:23:19,835 --> 00:23:21,425
Michelle Branch, Jessica Harp this is Haley.

426
00:23:21,502 --> 00:23:22,137
- Hi.
- Hey.

427
00:23:22,218 --> 00:23:24,324
Hey. Haley James?
- Haley James-Scott actually.

428
00:23:24,411 --> 00:23:26,095
Oh, you know what, we’ve heard a lot about you.

429
00:23:26,576 --> 00:23:28,368
Uh… I don’t think that’s possible.

430
00:23:28,537 --> 00:23:32,049
No, our opening act gave you rave reviews. Didn’t you?

431
00:23:32,367 --> 00:23:33,756
I said she was okay.

432
00:23:45,929 --> 00:23:48,382
So… you’re the opening act?

433
00:23:48,496 --> 00:23:49,381
Not for long.

434
00:23:49,758 --> 00:23:51,174
I’ll be headlining soon.

435
00:23:51,403 --> 00:23:55,176
So, Haley, um… Chris played us your duet and it sounds really great.

436
00:23:55,274 --> 00:23:56,954
You should join him on stage tonight.

437
00:23:57,070 --> 00:24:00,173
Oh, thanks… but... I don’t think…

438
00:24:01,151 --> 00:24:05,176
I’m just-I gotta head out, but it was really nice to meet you guys.

439
00:24:07,035 --> 00:24:08,299
Nice to meet you too.

440
00:24:14,514 --> 00:24:15,913
What the hell do you think you’re doing?

441
00:24:15,985 --> 00:24:18,175
Giving you the biggest break of your life. You’re welcome by the way.

442
00:24:18,238 --> 00:24:20,705
No, no, no, no, no, you did not do me any favours, okay?

443
00:24:20,775 --> 00:24:22,471
I busted my ass to get The Wreckers here.

444
00:24:22,539 --> 00:24:23,690
Yeah, but I sealed the deal.

445
00:24:23,766 --> 00:24:25,825
Why? So you could see Haley?

446
00:24:26,942 --> 00:24:28,262
I know that you kissed her.

447
00:24:29,142 --> 00:24:30,766
Listen, it takes two, okay?

448
00:24:31,745 --> 00:24:33,357
She didn’t exactly push me away.

449
00:24:35,231 --> 00:24:36,799
You’re wasting your time, you know?

450
00:24:37,063 --> 00:24:38,190
She’s over you.

451
00:24:39,106 --> 00:24:40,944
Then you got nothing to worry about.

452
00:24:41,897 --> 00:24:45,568
Hey, you guys. Thanks a lot for coming out tonight to check out The Wreckers.

453
00:24:45,634 --> 00:24:47,882
We have a lot of great music coming your way…

454
00:24:48,190 --> 00:24:51,835
and, we also have… Chris Keller.

455
00:24:59,351 --> 00:25:00,548
What’s he doing here?

456
00:25:00,692 --> 00:25:03,453
I… I didn’t know he was coming, I swear.

457
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:06,402
You guys still aren’t ready for this.

458
00:25:06,759 --> 00:25:08,311
But I’m in a forgiving mood.

459
00:25:09,370 --> 00:25:10,610
This one’s for you Haley.

460
00:25:11,926 --> 00:25:14,486
I started up my hollow,

461
00:25:14,732 --> 00:25:17,026
A piece of wood to follow,

462
00:25:17,316 --> 00:25:21,459
A day that doesn’t come to the lucky.

463
00:25:22,652 --> 00:25:25,399
And I realise there’s tomorrow,

464
00:25:25,605 --> 00:25:28,981
But I would rather wallow in the rain,

465
00:25:29,028 --> 00:25:30,574
You told Brooke about the windshield?

466
00:25:31,315 --> 00:25:32,390
I’m working up to it.

467
00:25:35,781 --> 00:25:36,702
Vote for me.

468
00:25:37,849 --> 00:25:40,241
Well I’m cruisin’ El Paseo.

469
00:25:40,353 --> 00:25:44,300
In my off-white coupe back ’65,

470
00:25:48,581 --> 00:25:51,285
Oh, I'm cruisin' down my own street,

471
00:25:51,474 --> 00:25:53,844
And my hoopty says to me,

472
00:25:54,099 --> 00:25:56,675
"You better hang on to your benchseat,

473
00:25:56,881 --> 00:25:59,107
I'm gonna take you for a ride",

474
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,991
And I'll let you know,

475
00:26:01,135 --> 00:26:06,445
When it comes, when it comes,

476
00:26:06,573 --> 00:26:09,025
I'll let you know,

477
00:26:09,234 --> 00:26:12,049
But don't stay up for me,

478
00:26:12,269 --> 00:26:19,145
Don't wait up for me if I'm not home, yeah,

479
00:26:22,707 --> 00:26:25,814
So wait for fate to find me...

480
00:26:27,411 --> 00:26:28,465
Maybe we should go.

481
00:26:28,543 --> 00:26:30,495
No. No, I’m gonna waste that guy.

482
00:26:33,486 --> 00:26:35,106
I thought that you weren’t coming.

483
00:26:35,414 --> 00:26:36,996
My ride’s running late.

484
00:26:37,717 --> 00:26:38,966
Who’s the stud?

485
00:26:39,494 --> 00:26:40,466
Chris.

486
00:26:44,169 --> 00:26:46,857
Well this evening just got interesting.

487
00:26:47,001 --> 00:26:48,689
Yes, I'm on the road tomorrow,

488
00:26:48,802 --> 00:26:51,665
So, next time that I see you in school,

489
00:26:51,772 --> 00:26:53,799
It won’t be for too long,

490
00:26:53,866 --> 00:26:55,740
And I'll let you know,

491
00:26:55,929 --> 00:27:01,224
When it comes, when it comes,

492
00:27:01,305 --> 00:27:03,773
I'll let you know,

493
00:27:03,881 --> 00:27:06,779
But don't stay up for me,

494
00:27:06,971 --> 00:27:11,587
Don't wait up for me if I'm not home-

495
00:27:12,873 --> 00:27:14,386
Thanks a lot guys, you’ve been…

496
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:15,898
acceptable.

497
00:27:16,796 --> 00:27:17,961
The Wreckers up next.

498
00:27:26,059 --> 00:27:27,392
Looking for an autograph?

499
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:30,245
No, actually, I was looking to kick your ass.

500
00:27:30,991 --> 00:27:32,087
But then I realised;

501
00:27:32,768 --> 00:27:33,777
why bother?

502
00:27:34,617 --> 00:27:35,855
There’s nothing here for you.

503
00:27:36,332 --> 00:27:37,980
Haley sees what you really are;

504
00:27:38,328 --> 00:27:39,942
pathetic poser.

505
00:27:40,367 --> 00:27:41,671
Just wanted to let you know.

506
00:27:44,134 --> 00:27:45,000
You’re wrong.

507
00:27:45,902 --> 00:27:48,795
You’re just trying to silence that voice inside your head.

508
00:27:49,352 --> 00:27:50,924
Yeah, you know the one.

509
00:27:51,190 --> 00:27:53,075
That’s growing louder every day.

510
00:27:53,187 --> 00:27:55,803
It’s saying ‘we’re drifting apart’, ‘I’m losing her’.

511
00:27:55,876 --> 00:27:58,645
Actually, it’s saying ‘shut this guys up, once and for all’.

512
00:27:58,855 --> 00:28:02,510
Okay, maybe I’m wrong. Maybe she does love you.

513
00:28:02,624 --> 00:28:03,581
She does.

514
00:28:04,144 --> 00:28:05,783
What if that’s not enough?

515
00:28:10,908 --> 00:28:17,318
Okay you guys, the wait is over. Please join me in welcoming, to TRIC, recording artists;

516
00:28:17,384 --> 00:28:20,927
Michelle Branch and Jessica Harp – The Wreckers!

517
00:28:25,648 --> 00:28:29,463
Hey, thanks you guys. It’s so great to be here in Tree Hill.

518
00:28:31,608 --> 00:28:34,194
And... vote for Brooke.

519
00:28:47,456 --> 00:28:51,741
Do you want to run away together.

520
00:28:52,201 --> 00:28:56,748
I would say it was your best night ever,

521
00:28:56,896 --> 00:28:59,041
Too bad I fell for it.

522
00:29:01,713 --> 00:29:04,658
And I walked along

523
00:29:06,169 --> 00:29:09,999
Waiting for you to come along

524
00:29:10,869 --> 00:29:14,904
Take my tortured heart by the hand

525
00:29:15,446 --> 00:29:17,826
And write me off

526
00:29:19,917 --> 00:29:24,134
Do you know I cry?

527
00:29:24,334 --> 00:29:28,912
Do you know I die?

528
00:29:29,050 --> 00:29:33,843
Do you know I cry?

529
00:29:34,098 --> 00:29:37,252
And it's not the good kind

530
00:29:44,707 --> 00:29:48,592
You forced me to become strong

531
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:54,379
When I just cried, being weak

532
00:29:58,609 --> 00:30:01,686
And you think you know

533
00:30:03,262 --> 00:30:06,984
And I would like to think so

534
00:30:07,301 --> 00:30:08,029
Hey.

535
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:12,606
I have a confession to make.

536
00:30:14,142 --> 00:30:15,703
I’m jealous of Jules.

537
00:30:18,664 --> 00:30:21,761
Ever since I’ve had Lucas - before that, even -

538
00:30:22,084 --> 00:30:24,670
you’ve… been the one person that I could count on.

539
00:30:25,677 --> 00:30:27,434
It’s gonna be hard to lose that.

540
00:30:28,274 --> 00:30:32,891
Karen, we’ll still be in each others lives.

541
00:30:33,219 --> 00:30:34,459
That would never change.

542
00:30:34,869 --> 00:30:35,862
I know.

543
00:30:36,634 --> 00:30:39,091
It’s just… taking some getting used to.

544
00:30:43,101 --> 00:30:46,367
I'm tired of hiding

545
00:30:46,676 --> 00:30:50,668
behind these lying eyes

546
00:30:52,287 --> 00:30:56,132
I'm tired of this smile

547
00:30:56,204 --> 00:31:00,228
That even I don't recognize

548
00:31:03,791 --> 00:31:04,575
Hey.

549
00:31:08,117 --> 00:31:12,054
Um… you played a really great set.

550
00:31:13,874 --> 00:31:14,886
Yeah, I know.

551
00:31:18,568 --> 00:31:19,622
Alright, well…

552
00:31:22,090 --> 00:31:23,135
good luck.

553
00:31:24,148 --> 00:31:25,670
You wanna know about it, don’t you?

554
00:31:27,328 --> 00:31:29,433
The tour; the music.

555
00:31:29,555 --> 00:31:31,169
It’s all happening for me now.

556
00:31:33,922 --> 00:31:37,132
- It could still happen for you, Haley.
- It will, someday.

557
00:31:37,353 --> 00:31:38,669
Well, someday is here.

558
00:31:39,257 --> 00:31:41,454
I talked to Michelle, she wants you on the tour.

559
00:31:41,823 --> 00:31:43,886
- What?
- People love the duet.

560
00:31:44,163 --> 00:31:48,392
It’s real. You know, Jessica started off as Michelle’s back-up singer.

561
00:31:48,479 --> 00:31:49,523
Look at them now.

562
00:31:49,671 --> 00:31:53,118
The difference between wannabees and successes is grabbing opportunity.

563
00:31:54,285 --> 00:31:57,102
Our tour bus leaves in a couple of hours and you know you should be on it.

564
00:31:59,078 --> 00:32:00,091
You brave enough?

565
00:32:13,917 --> 00:32:17,833
You know, now that Taylor’s leaving, maybe we’ll have enough hot water for our own showers.

566
00:32:26,004 --> 00:32:28,969
Haley, what’s wrong?

567
00:32:35,368 --> 00:32:37,273
Michelle Branch likes my voice.

568
00:32:37,359 --> 00:32:39,905
She thinks I could be a singer. A real one.

569
00:32:43,274 --> 00:32:45,517
Chris said that she wants me on tour.

570
00:32:45,818 --> 00:32:48,794
I’m so far ahead with classes and I’d be back in time for finals.

571
00:32:48,879 --> 00:32:50,257
So says the great Chris.

572
00:32:50,688 --> 00:32:54,435
No, this isn’t about him, Nathan. This is about… opportunity.

573
00:32:54,548 --> 00:32:58,531
I have, my entire life, been the reliable one and the dependable one

574
00:32:58,628 --> 00:33:02,012
and I’ve always done… precisely what’s expected of me.

575
00:33:02,105 --> 00:33:03,108
Till we got married.

576
00:33:03,195 --> 00:33:05,806
Exactly. And then I finally did something for me…

577
00:33:06,156 --> 00:33:07,815
something that I wanted…

578
00:33:08,771 --> 00:33:10,465
and the world didn’t end.

579
00:33:12,421 --> 00:33:14,245
And I have that chance again.

580
00:33:16,243 --> 00:33:19,831
- If you leave me....
- This is not the end for us.

581
00:33:20,552 --> 00:33:24,654
This is my shot to find out if I am good enough to have a life in music.

582
00:33:25,228 --> 00:33:27,280
Or if nights at TRIC are all I get.

583
00:33:28,058 --> 00:33:29,968
And this has nothing to do with Chris?

584
00:33:31,202 --> 00:33:34,305
No. Absolutely not.

585
00:33:36,686 --> 00:33:38,923
Then why haven’t you asked me to come with you?

586
00:33:44,704 --> 00:33:45,810
Did you kiss him?

587
00:33:51,365 --> 00:33:52,220
Yes.

588
00:33:52,998 --> 00:33:57,033
I’m sorry. You have to believe me. That’s not what this is about.

589
00:33:58,436 --> 00:33:59,358
Nathan...

590
00:33:59,692 --> 00:34:04,129
Haley, listen; if you wanna go, you should go.

591
00:34:05,430 --> 00:34:06,561
If you do…

592
00:34:08,727 --> 00:34:09,951
we’re done.

593
00:34:27,728 --> 00:34:28,680
Unpack!

594
00:34:31,726 --> 00:34:32,719
I can’t.

595
00:34:32,997 --> 00:34:35,055
I said unpack!

596
00:34:40,518 --> 00:34:41,358
No.

597
00:34:44,517 --> 00:34:45,935
Lucas, Lucas.

598
00:34:46,927 --> 00:34:50,179
If you just tell me what Dan has said or done, we can fight him together.

599
00:34:51,059 --> 00:34:51,879
No.

600
00:34:53,481 --> 00:34:54,837
Mom, we can’t.

601
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:45,228
Go back to sleep. I’ve got her.

602
00:36:02,453 --> 00:36:06,145
Hey, Mouth, you are just in time. I am so buzzed from the reaction to my campaign

603
00:36:06,202 --> 00:36:07,697
that I am gonna practice my speech.

604
00:36:07,783 --> 00:36:10,313
I’m the one who threw the brick through your car window.

605
00:36:12,509 --> 00:36:14,593
I was drunk and…

606
00:36:15,771 --> 00:36:16,922
I was angry.

607
00:36:19,536 --> 00:36:21,111
Angry about what?

608
00:36:22,485 --> 00:36:23,820
Being a little brother to you.

609
00:36:25,217 --> 00:36:26,457
And everyone else.

610
00:36:35,011 --> 00:36:37,603
I’m not sure we can be friends anymore, Mouth.

611
00:36:40,915 --> 00:36:41,786
Me neither.

612
00:36:45,004 --> 00:36:46,221
It’s too hard.

613
00:36:58,835 --> 00:37:00,443
I thought I knew you.

614
00:37:04,810 --> 00:37:06,633
But I guess it’s easier…

615
00:37:06,940 --> 00:37:08,492
to see what we want,

616
00:37:09,674 --> 00:37:11,498
than to look for the truth.

617
00:37:15,022 --> 00:37:17,601
You think you know me but you don’t;

618
00:37:19,250 --> 00:37:21,850
and that means you don’t know what I can do.

619
00:37:26,094 --> 00:37:30,145
You see me as someone who’s popular… and has all the answers;

620
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:32,058
that’s not true.

621
00:37:49,251 --> 00:37:52,478
I know what it’s like to search for something more, Haley.

622
00:37:53,931 --> 00:37:55,366
That’s why I’m always running.

623
00:37:58,269 --> 00:38:01,228
But then, I’ve never had a Nathan to come home to.

624
00:38:03,858 --> 00:38:05,882
I may not always know what I’m doing…

625
00:38:07,726 --> 00:38:09,625
but I’ll try make things better.

626
00:38:25,105 --> 00:38:27,263
It’s for you. Come on.

627
00:38:30,781 --> 00:38:32,419
Don’t say I never gave you anything.

628
00:38:32,977 --> 00:38:36,131
And when I make a mistake… because face it,

629
00:38:36,998 --> 00:38:38,051
we all do…

630
00:38:41,784 --> 00:38:42,829
He left.

631
00:38:44,243 --> 00:38:46,545
And I don’t know what to do.

632
00:38:50,843 --> 00:38:52,813
I promise I’ll ask for your help.

633
00:39:12,132 --> 00:39:13,001
Haley?

634
00:39:16,216 --> 00:39:19,857
I’m sorry Nathan… she’s gone.

635
00:39:30,478 --> 00:39:32,233
I can’t do this alone…

636
00:39:40,219 --> 00:39:44,454
But if you’ll take a chance on me, we can do great things together.

637
00:39:50,289 --> 00:39:54,960
I promise, if you believe in me, I’ll find the courage to reach for your every dream.

638
00:40:13,610 --> 00:40:15,475
'Living with HCM'

639
00:40:23,105 --> 00:40:24,272
You got everything you need?

640
00:40:26,222 --> 00:40:27,016
Yeah.

641
00:40:27,453 --> 00:40:28,168
Listen…

642
00:40:29,643 --> 00:40:31,388
thank you for paying for my medication.

643
00:40:32,356 --> 00:40:34,175
I don’t want my mom to know, so…

644
00:40:34,912 --> 00:40:36,346
I need you to keep funding the bill.

645
00:40:37,635 --> 00:40:39,545
Sure… it’ll stay our secret.

646
00:40:40,564 --> 00:40:41,716
But tell me something.

647
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:45,203
How did you convince her that you didn’t have HCM?

648
00:40:48,848 --> 00:40:52,043
I used Keith’s… negative results letter.

649
00:40:53,946 --> 00:40:54,731
Really?

650
00:40:56,302 --> 00:40:59,467
I wouldn’t have pegged you as being so… duplicitous.

651
00:41:02,135 --> 00:41:04,080
Well I guess I’m your son after all.

652
00:41:10,549 --> 00:41:15,530
John F. Kennedy said the courage of life is a magnificent mixture triumph…

653
00:41:15,740 --> 00:41:16,774
and tragedy.

654
00:41:18,105 --> 00:41:21,919
A man does what he must, in spite of personal consequences…


655
00:41:22,005 --> 00:41:26,119
in spite of obstacles and dangers and pressures…

656
00:41:30,001 --> 00:41:32,799
And that is the basis of all morality.
