1
00:00:00,997 --> 00:00:02,490
Previously on "One Tree Hill"…

2
00:00:02,536 --> 00:00:04,774
Who would have known that Dan Scott’s basketball pedigree

3
00:00:04,809 --> 00:00:08,409
would be inherited by his two sons, Nathan Scott and Lucas.

4
00:00:08,599 --> 00:00:10,570
I can’t stand being connected to Nathan or Dan.

5
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:15,491
This is all about you, Danny, until you acknowledge that Lucas is your son.

6
00:00:15,547 --> 00:00:18,072
I finally saw you clearly for the first time last night,

7
00:00:18,101 --> 00:00:20,109
the way you treated me, the way you treated your brother.

8
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:22,146
- Don’t call him that.
- I mean it. We’re done.

9
00:00:22,586 --> 00:00:23,616
You still in denial?

10
00:00:23,728 --> 00:00:24,389
About what?

11
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:26,070
Missing her.

12
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:27,900
What, are you my tutor or my shrink?

13
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:29,510
You’re just tutoring him?

14
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:31,424
I am just tutoring him.

15
00:00:31,455 --> 00:00:34,900
Nathan? God! He got a good grade on a math quiz. It was nothing!

16
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:36,815
Keith!

17
00:00:37,378 --> 00:00:40,478
I like who you are. And I do count on you.

18
00:00:40,525 --> 00:00:41,439
I love you.

19
00:00:41,695 --> 00:00:42,821
Wow. You made me a mix?

20
00:00:42,939 --> 00:00:44,183
Don’t read too much into it.

21
00:00:44,841 --> 00:00:48,847
I think Nathan likes Tutor Girl, but I think Tutor Girl likes Lucas.

22
00:00:48,904 --> 00:00:52,196
And I know I like Lucas, and I don’t know who the hell you like anymore.

23
00:01:35,061 --> 00:01:38,774
All I remember is you and me and Tutor Girl in my car,

24
00:01:38,937 --> 00:01:42,378
and then Lucas and Nathan, and then you said something about being into Lucas

25
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:43,908
but it could have been Nathan,

26
00:01:44,164 --> 00:01:45,967
- and I need to know.
- Need?

27
00:01:46,623 --> 00:01:51,087
Two of them, two of us, plenty of fine Scott boys to go around,

28
00:01:51,139 --> 00:01:53,427
and your courtesy hold on Lucas has expired.

29
00:01:53,893 --> 00:01:55,715
And you and Nathan were so…

30
00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:58,142
interesting together.

31
00:01:58,649 --> 00:02:00,344
Plus, we could still trade off once in a while…

32
00:02:00,575 --> 00:02:02,060
or twice. Win-win.

33
00:02:03,514 --> 00:02:04,394
Hey, broody.

34
00:02:05,433 --> 00:02:07,875
Hey, cheery. Peyton.

35
00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:11,066
So, I’ll see you at practice?

36
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,008
As always.

37
00:02:12,755 --> 00:02:13,656
Yeah, you too.

38
00:02:18,075 --> 00:02:22,576
So, what’s the deal? Are we gonna hang out at this annual Scott money burn or what?

39
00:02:22,714 --> 00:02:23,676
Yeah, right.

40
00:02:24,336 --> 00:02:26,851
Like I’m gonna spend the night with Nathan and Dan on my Friday off?

41
00:02:26,917 --> 00:02:30,040
I don’t think so. I’d rather stay home with "The Great Gatsby."

42
00:02:32,395 --> 00:02:33,635
You know, I read a book last night.

43
00:02:33,983 --> 00:02:34,562
Really?

44
00:02:35,386 --> 00:02:39,293
Yeah, it’s about this girl and this guy, and they’ve got this really weird vibe thing going on,

45
00:02:39,355 --> 00:02:42,523
but there’s all this drama, ‘cause the girl’s got this ex-boyfriend

46
00:02:42,584 --> 00:02:46,338
who turns out to be none other than the guy’s brother.

47
00:02:46,501 --> 00:02:50,884
So the whole thing comes to this great, big climax and this big party at their evil dad’s house.

48
00:02:51,243 --> 00:02:51,909
Really?

49
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:55,482
Hmm. What happens in the end?

50
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,437
You’re just gonna have to show up to find out.

51
00:03:06,275 --> 00:03:09,486
Oh, this is so stupid. What-why do we have to study history anyway?

52
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:11,964
So we’re not doomed to repeat it.

53
00:03:12,778 --> 00:03:13,279
What?

54
00:03:14,483 --> 00:03:16,372
Look, don’t lose hope, okay?

55
00:03:16,577 --> 00:03:19,286
Tomorrow’s a teacher’s work day so you’ve got a three-day weekend to study.

56
00:03:20,012 --> 00:03:22,481
Minus my dad’s annual kiss-his-ass jamboree.

57
00:03:24,605 --> 00:03:29,736
Hey, I would invite you, Haley, but it’s kind of a b-ball crowd.

58
00:03:29,807 --> 00:03:32,296
Oh, please, come on. Like I want to kiss your dad’s ass anyway.

59
00:03:33,211 --> 00:03:33,806
Yeah.

60
00:03:34,081 --> 00:03:35,131
I made you a study guide.

61
00:03:36,088 --> 00:03:40,467
And, everything you need to ace your history exam…

62
00:03:40,528 --> 00:03:46,032
is right in this little box of tricks here-NoDoz, eye drops, number-two pencils.

63
00:03:46,083 --> 00:03:47,891
Why don’t you just text message me the answers.

64
00:03:48,014 --> 00:03:49,689
Oh! No.

65
00:03:52,422 --> 00:03:55,714
So, um, just give me a call if you need anything, okay?

66
00:03:57,552 --> 00:03:59,303
Thanks for cutting Lucas some slack.

67
00:04:00,342 --> 00:04:01,572
A deal’s a deal, right?

68
00:04:02,705 --> 00:04:03,378
Right.

69
00:04:10,183 --> 00:04:11,468
Anything worth sharing?

70
00:04:12,503 --> 00:04:13,983
- Hmm?
- In the paper?

71
00:04:15,109 --> 00:04:18,775
Oh. Um, the Tar Heels won.

72
00:04:19,113 --> 00:04:20,792
- Oh, Deb.
- Hi, Karen.

73
00:04:21,181 --> 00:04:21,699
Hey.

74
00:04:21,956 --> 00:04:24,878
Um, I never heard from both of you about Dan’s party tomorrow

75
00:04:25,476 --> 00:04:27,925
for the team sponsors.

76
00:04:28,018 --> 00:04:32,185
For some reason, when I think of Dan, I just don’t think of the word party.

77
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:35,856
Oh, I’m sorry, Deb. I have the invitation here.

78
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:40,330
I was thinking about going, but after everything that happened last week-

79
00:04:40,397 --> 00:04:42,578
Yeah, that’s what I was afraid of.

80
00:04:43,371 --> 00:04:45,046
Dan feels horrible about that…

81
00:04:45,921 --> 00:04:47,497
- believe it or not.
- Not.

82
00:04:48,558 --> 00:04:49,578
And so do I.

83
00:04:50,162 --> 00:04:52,423
Anyway, it would mean a lot if you could both come.

84
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:56,392
It starts at three, but, uh, stop by anytime. See you.

85
00:04:57,016 --> 00:04:58,055
See you, Deb. Thanks.

86
00:05:00,611 --> 00:05:02,469
You know what? I think Deb’s right.

87
00:05:04,169 --> 00:05:06,447
We’re not living in some 1950s movie.

88
00:05:06,515 --> 00:05:09,310
I am the single mom of a player on the team.

89
00:05:09,535 --> 00:05:12,959
I don’t need to skulk around this town in a head scarf and dark glasses.

90
00:05:13,181 --> 00:05:14,512
Well, you’re never going to get Lucas to go.

91
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:17,160
- Oh, even if you’re going, too?
- Oh, not a chance.

92
00:05:17,927 --> 00:05:22,577
Besides, I don’t want things to be any weirder than they need to be.

93
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:25,074
Weirder? How?

94
00:05:25,453 --> 00:05:26,052
Well,

95
00:05:27,803 --> 00:05:29,580
you know, after dinner the other night,

96
00:05:30,424 --> 00:05:32,457
I said some pretty crazy things.

97
00:05:34,158 --> 00:05:36,712
No, I don’t remember anything crazy.

98
00:05:39,149 --> 00:05:40,153
Well, I’m gonna go.

99
00:05:40,337 --> 00:05:41,858
You let me know if you change your mind.

100
00:05:42,033 --> 00:05:43,373
-  Okay.
- Mm-hmm.

101
00:05:48,243 --> 00:05:54,147
Okay, you guys, listen up. Now, you’ll all want to pay close attention to this next batch of slides.

102
00:05:54,499 --> 00:05:57,545
We’ll be discussing them following the slide show and,

103
00:05:58,070 --> 00:06:03,381
I also have a feeling that this material may find its way onto your next quiz, so…

104
00:06:03,429 --> 00:06:04,222
How are you, Nate?

105
00:06:06,148 --> 00:06:06,844
Bored.

106
00:06:07,397 --> 00:06:08,467
And lonely, right?

107
00:06:09,659 --> 00:06:10,751
Just a smidge.

108
00:06:12,502 --> 00:06:15,537
Brooke, whatever drugs you’re on, save them for the party, okay?

109
00:06:15,645 --> 00:06:20,187
Ah, "the party." Guess who’s coming with me, and I’ll tell you Peyton.

110
00:06:20,519 --> 00:06:21,196
W hatever.

111
00:06:21,994 --> 00:06:25,803
She’s off my radar, and apparently, I’m off hers too.

112
00:06:26,069 --> 00:06:29,249
That was pot Peyton. She’s totally back on track.

113
00:06:29,613 --> 00:06:34,527
And I think the new "old Peyton" would be open to discussing a reconciliation.

114
00:06:35,910 --> 00:06:36,935
Did she tell you that?

115
00:06:37,032 --> 00:06:38,440
She tells me everything.

116
00:06:38,896 --> 00:06:40,800
- What are you up to, Brooke?
- What?

117
00:06:41,328 --> 00:06:44,651
I just want to see two people that are perfect for each other back together.

118
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,023
Is that a crime?

119
00:06:54,583 --> 00:06:55,462
Sorry I’m late, coach.

120
00:06:55,971 --> 00:06:59,436
Why should today be any different, Jagielski? Move your ass.

121
00:06:59,555 --> 00:07:03,164
The rest of you ladies start defense drills, pronto!

122
00:07:04,926 --> 00:07:06,355
Why is coach so easy on you, Jagielski?

123
00:07:06,488 --> 00:07:07,792
Baumgartner got wind sprints.

124
00:07:08,069 --> 00:07:08,842
We party together.

125
00:07:09,344 --> 00:07:10,195
Maybe they’re lovers.

126
00:07:11,362 --> 00:07:12,488
Why, did you two break up?

127
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:18,939
So, anyway, man, what’s the deal? What’s going on?

128
00:07:18,985 --> 00:07:22,763
You know, you’re out sick all the time, and you come in late and cut out early.

129
00:07:22,953 --> 00:07:24,397
I don’t understand. Coach just lets you.

130
00:07:24,531 --> 00:07:25,436
Just helping me out.

131
00:07:26,793 --> 00:07:27,409
Meaning?

132
00:07:27,996 --> 00:07:29,189
Meaning he’s just helping me out.

133
00:07:32,195 --> 00:07:32,886
All right.

134
00:07:54,113 --> 00:07:57,575
- Whoa! Walking here.
- God! I’m-I’m sorry.

135
00:07:57,734 --> 00:07:59,418
Like you weren’t aiming.

136
00:07:59,494 --> 00:08:00,489
You’re not on that list.

137
00:08:01,333 --> 00:08:02,295
You need a ride somewhere?

138
00:08:04,474 --> 00:08:05,614
Come on, get in.

139
00:08:09,486 --> 00:08:11,608
I guess it’s better to be in your car then under it.

140
00:08:18,655 --> 00:08:20,256
So, I’m not really good at this.

141
00:08:20,487 --> 00:08:23,232
Yeah, obviously you’re gonna want to put that in gear and give it a little gas.

142
00:08:23,292 --> 00:08:24,056
No, I meant...

143
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:27,855
I mean the whole not-being-defensive thing.

144
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:28,870
Okay.

145
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:34,210
Last week in Brooke’s car, you said he cares about me,

146
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:37,830
and I was trying really hard to be cool, and I didn’t ask,

147
00:08:38,602 --> 00:08:41,715
- whether you meant Nathan or Lucas.
- And now you’re asking?

148
00:08:43,209 --> 00:08:45,483
In a pathetic kind of way, yeah.

149
00:08:45,581 --> 00:08:48,744
I’m not gonna be much help. I guess I meant both of them.

150
00:08:51,198 --> 00:08:52,058
Lucky you.

151
00:08:55,283 --> 00:08:58,688
Look, it’s not like you need my permission or anything, but if you like Nathan,

152
00:08:58,759 --> 00:09:02,399
it’s totally cool. Just be really careful.

153
00:09:02,507 --> 00:09:04,822
Be careful. Yes, I know. You told me.

154
00:09:06,528 --> 00:09:08,535
- You be careful, too.
- With which one?

155
00:09:08,785 --> 00:09:12,062
Driving. My mother likes it when I get home alive. Let’s go.

156
00:09:18,621 --> 00:09:19,577
Hey, mom. Hey, Keith.

157
00:09:20,509 --> 00:09:22,618
This doesn’t fit anymore. I need a new jacket.

158
00:09:23,754 --> 00:09:25,880
I think I’m going to go to this thing tomorrow.

159
00:09:26,039 --> 00:09:26,976
What changed your mind?

160
00:09:28,491 --> 00:09:29,562
Well, I don’t know. I mean…

161
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,620
Nothing really.

162
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:37,278
Well, we’ll go to Vietti’s first thing. Get you a new jacket.

163
00:09:37,856 --> 00:09:39,889
All right. Thanks, mom. See you, Keith.

164
00:09:40,012 --> 00:09:40,730
See you, Luke.

165
00:09:41,384 --> 00:09:43,443
- A girl?
- What else?

166
00:09:43,692 --> 00:09:47,237
Hmm. Well, I guess I’m gonna have to go to this thing then.

167
00:09:47,323 --> 00:09:49,446
You? I thought you already had your mind made up.

168
00:09:50,047 --> 00:09:51,998
- Did you get cold feet?
- Like ice.

169
00:09:52,217 --> 00:09:54,948
Something about stepping directly into the Lion’s Den.

170
00:09:55,229 --> 00:09:55,991
Oh…

171
00:09:56,924 --> 00:09:58,132
Okay, you talked me into it.

172
00:09:58,306 --> 00:10:01,660
Just promise me you won’t punch him unless I ask you real nice.

173
00:10:01,962 --> 00:10:02,653
Okay.

174
00:10:02,867 --> 00:10:04,506
- Enjoy.
- Bye-bye.

175
00:10:08,858 --> 00:10:11,178
Haven’t you heard goth is the new geek?

176
00:10:13,442 --> 00:10:14,690
Tonight’s gonna be killer.

177
00:10:15,489 --> 00:10:18,135
You and Nathan, me and Lucas, an open bar.

178
00:10:18,735 --> 00:10:23,256
There is no me and Nathan, or you and Lucas, for that matter.

179
00:10:23,639 --> 00:10:27,122
For now. You know, Nathan’s loving the idea that you’re coming tonight.

180
00:10:27,209 --> 00:10:28,058
How do you know that?

181
00:10:28,258 --> 00:10:29,901
‘Cause he told be he’s still hot for you.

182
00:10:30,414 --> 00:10:32,672
He was actually very sweet about it.

183
00:10:32,733 --> 00:10:33,473
Nathan Scott?

184
00:10:33,537 --> 00:10:35,041
You know you two were meant to be together.

185
00:10:36,282 --> 00:10:37,494
That’s a scary thought.

186
00:10:52,072 --> 00:10:52,636
Haley?

187
00:10:54,457 --> 00:10:55,185
What are you doing here?

188
00:10:56,737 --> 00:10:58,559
First, I am saving you from that tie.

189
00:10:59,409 --> 00:11:00,151
Second…

190
00:11:02,261 --> 00:11:03,490
we need to talk.

191
00:11:03,837 --> 00:11:04,943
Well, could we do both at the same time.

192
00:11:05,050 --> 00:11:05,855
Yeah.

193
00:11:07,095 --> 00:11:11,205
Uh, okay, you’re not gonna like this. In fact…

194
00:11:12,224 --> 00:11:13,100
you’re gonna hate this.

195
00:11:14,405 --> 00:11:19,294
But I feel that I should tell you in the interest of full friendship disclosure.

196
00:11:20,538 --> 00:11:22,687
Yeah, right. What could be worse than you tutoring Nathan, huh?

197
00:11:28,465 --> 00:11:29,638
You like him.

198
00:11:29,694 --> 00:11:33,671
Luke, do not freak out on me, okay? I can’t help it any more then you can.

199
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:36,125
- I don’t like him!
- I’m talking about you and Peyton.

200
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:40,706
We  don’t decide who we like. We just-it happens.

201
00:11:40,999 --> 00:11:42,453
Do you know what you’re getting yourself into?

202
00:11:42,504 --> 00:11:46,155
I’m not getting myself into anything. I am thinking about maybe getting into something

203
00:11:46,201 --> 00:11:48,485
that is never gonna happen anyway, so-

204
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:50,542
But what could you possibly like in the guy, huh?

205
00:11:51,347 --> 00:11:54,455
Different stuff. We connect.

206
00:11:54,768 --> 00:11:59,320
Yes, he can be a total ass sometimes but I’m telling you, it’s just a defense mechanism.

207
00:11:59,391 --> 00:12:01,516
He really opens up with me, Lucas.

208
00:12:03,764 --> 00:12:05,151
You know how I feel about it.

209
00:12:07,224 --> 00:12:10,388
And I’m sorry for that. I am.

210
00:12:12,877 --> 00:12:15,448
But I get it, all right?

211
00:12:16,384 --> 00:12:17,264
I understand.

212
00:12:17,824 --> 00:12:18,529
Okay.

213
00:12:18,616 --> 00:12:20,228
Just do me a favor, okay? Just-

214
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,407
Be careful?

215
00:12:24,883 --> 00:12:26,640
I wish everybody would stop saying that.

216
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:33,670
Three fingers of whiskey, just a whisper of sweet vermouth,

217
00:12:34,058 --> 00:12:37,478
a splash of bitters, a crush cherry- A perfect Manhattan.

218
00:12:37,724 --> 00:12:39,930
Oh, so that’s how you like it?

219
00:12:40,454 --> 00:12:41,805
Well, that’s one way I like it.

220
00:12:42,815 --> 00:12:43,659
Excuse us.

221
00:12:46,183 --> 00:12:49,777
She’s young enough to be your daughter, and in this town, she might just be.

222
00:12:49,972 --> 00:12:52,009
- Ouch.
- Sorry, couldn’t resist.

223
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:56,930
I spoke with Karen yesterday. She might be coming with Lucas and Keith.

224
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:59,264
They had to know the invitation was just a formality.

225
00:12:59,352 --> 00:13:00,882
Mm. Until I invited them in person.

226
00:13:00,985 --> 00:13:02,608
Deb, you know how important this party is for me.

227
00:13:02,719 --> 00:13:04,184
Oh, I thought this party was for the team.

228
00:13:04,226 --> 00:13:06,228
So you go behind my back and turn into my worst nightmare.

229
00:13:06,269 --> 00:13:09,403
Oh, no, Dan. Your worst nightmare is what’ll happen if they show up

230
00:13:09,458 --> 00:13:12,284
and you do anything to make them feel uncomfortable in our home.

231
00:13:22,228 --> 00:13:26,160
Hey, guys, maybe we should have, like, a signal. You know, in case one of us wants to leave.

232
00:13:26,754 --> 00:13:28,038
Maybe we should just leave.

233
00:13:28,238 --> 00:13:31,240
Oh, come on. That’s no fun. How about "caw"!

234
00:13:31,919 --> 00:13:32,636
"Caw"?

235
00:13:33,276 --> 00:13:34,909
Yeah. You know, like a raven. Caw!

236
00:13:35,422 --> 00:13:36,088
Caw!

237
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:41,265
That’s the spirit. So, when one of us wants to leave, we just "caw."

238
00:13:41,326 --> 00:13:41,949
Caw!

239
00:13:42,637 --> 00:13:43,446
Caw!

240
00:13:48,933 --> 00:13:49,671
You ready, mom?

241
00:13:50,199 --> 00:13:51,391
Ready as I’ll ever be.

242
00:13:53,470 --> 00:13:58,206
You know, maybe the best plan is to just avoid him all night, and then that way…

243
00:14:01,058 --> 00:14:01,872
Come on in.

244
00:14:11,666 --> 00:14:12,358
Spirit.

245
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:16,996
The vital principle and animating force within every human being.

246
00:14:17,827 --> 00:14:21,682
Of course, for some of you, spirit simply means alcoholic beverages.

247
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:25,659
But this Ravens basketball team

248
00:14:26,782 --> 00:14:28,266
has a surplus of spirit.

249
00:14:28,615 --> 00:14:31,123
It’s an incredible team with an incredible group of young men.

250
00:14:31,793 --> 00:14:36,202
Except for their crushing defeat by the fathers this year, this team has been on a roll.

251
00:14:39,121 --> 00:14:39,737
Well…

252
00:14:40,432 --> 00:14:44,374
- Oh, it is so on tonight.
- … my lovely wife for setting up this party.

253
00:14:44,446 --> 00:14:46,771
Look at this, please.

254
00:14:47,994 --> 00:14:50,917
But Raven team spirit also includes the parents

255
00:14:51,389 --> 00:14:56,058
and the local businesses, whose financial support make this team great.

256
00:14:56,652 --> 00:14:59,689
Tonight’s for you. Enjoy.

257
00:15:01,086 --> 00:15:04,486
And here’s to our host, Dan Scott.

258
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:07,967
- Here, here!
- My parents are such suck-ups.

259
00:15:09,007 --> 00:15:11,741
So, what public humiliation you got planned for "Pukas" tonight?

260
00:15:12,590 --> 00:15:16,261
Nothing, Tim. It’s a little played out, don’t you think?

261
00:15:16,815 --> 00:15:17,598
Since when?

262
00:15:24,045 --> 00:15:27,202
You had a little sin of omission there in your speech, Danny boy.

263
00:15:28,186 --> 00:15:29,742
Didn’t I mention the coaching staff?

264
00:15:29,862 --> 00:15:32,185
If you did, I didn’t hear it. Here…

265
00:15:32,770 --> 00:15:33,910
you’re out of cashews.

266
00:15:42,007 --> 00:15:45,410
I’m gonna grab a drink at the bar before it fills up. You go talk to Nathan.

267
00:15:45,775 --> 00:15:47,131
See how he’s been looking at you?

268
00:16:07,176 --> 00:16:08,348
They’re never gonna serve you.

269
00:16:08,461 --> 00:16:10,611
Watch and learn. Bartenders love me.

270
00:16:14,379 --> 00:16:15,644
Soda or juice?

271
00:16:16,689 --> 00:16:19,658
Actually, I was gonna ask if you knew how to make a screaming orgasm.

272
00:16:20,855 --> 00:16:23,595
For a pretty girl like you, sure.

273
00:16:25,352 --> 00:16:26,653
So, what is this thing tonight?

274
00:16:27,012 --> 00:16:28,209
Ravens basketball.

275
00:16:28,746 --> 00:16:29,258
Oh.

276
00:16:30,856 --> 00:16:32,566
And what position do you play?

277
00:16:34,466 --> 00:16:35,444
Cheerleader.

278
00:16:36,329 --> 00:16:39,514
Jocks and cheerleaders. Lots of hormones tonight.

279
00:16:42,258 --> 00:16:43,661
Don’t go around advertising.

280
00:16:44,481 --> 00:16:45,858
Secret’s safe with me.

281
00:16:48,369 --> 00:16:49,778
I’ll have what she’s having.

282
00:16:50,308 --> 00:16:53,886
Right. Soda or juice?

283
00:16:58,949 --> 00:17:03,081
You would think that after 20 years, your brother’s ego would cease to amaze me.

284
00:17:03,441 --> 00:17:04,780
Try a lifetime.

285
00:17:05,836 --> 00:17:07,470
Hi. I’ll take a white wine, please.

286
00:17:07,710 --> 00:17:08,781
I’ll have club soda.

287
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:14,572
Hey, Laurie, pour me a double shot of your best top-shelf bourbon, would you, please?

288
00:17:16,318 --> 00:17:17,843
- Hello, Keith.
- Hey, Whitey.

289
00:17:19,425 --> 00:17:21,724
Well, Karen Roe.

290
00:17:22,527 --> 00:17:23,377
Look at you.

291
00:17:24,181 --> 00:17:25,092
Coach Durham.

292
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:28,021
Most grown-ups call me Whitey.

293
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:30,945
It’s good to see you coming ‘round again.

294
00:17:31,339 --> 00:17:34,694
Seeing you in my gym really turns back the clock.

295
00:17:36,019 --> 00:17:37,022
For me, too.

296
00:17:37,841 --> 00:17:43,198
Well, in my humble opinion, you have raised a fine son.

297
00:17:44,328 --> 00:17:45,430
You should be proud,

298
00:17:46,638 --> 00:17:48,108
and not just of the boy.

299
00:17:49,314 --> 00:17:50,350
Thank you.

300
00:18:12,786 --> 00:18:16,123
You  know, there are some states that could arrest you for what you’re thinking about right now.

301
00:18:17,348 --> 00:18:18,061
How are you doing, Jake?

302
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:20,195
I’m good. You do your thing, man.

303
00:18:21,444 --> 00:18:22,852
Hey, Jake, Lucas.

304
00:18:24,086 --> 00:18:25,780
Two handsome boys for the price of one.

305
00:18:26,487 --> 00:18:28,289
Hey, Brooke. Listen, I was gonna...

306
00:18:28,388 --> 00:18:31,392
Where are you going? I haven’t had the chance to invite you to the real party.

307
00:18:31,966 --> 00:18:33,338
It’s at my place, later.

308
00:18:33,537 --> 00:18:36,081
I’m only inviting the cool people, but I guess you can come.

309
00:18:37,230 --> 00:18:38,165
You too, Jake.

310
00:18:38,279 --> 00:18:40,941
Oh, thanks, Brooke, but I gotta cut out early tonight.

311
00:18:41,073 --> 00:18:42,232
Oh, like that’s a surprise.

312
00:18:42,988 --> 00:18:45,206
Obligations, man. I’ll see you, Luke.

313
00:18:45,314 --> 00:18:45,999
Take care, man.

314
00:18:46,116 --> 00:18:49,343
All right, Brooke. Just go easy, okay?

315
00:18:51,708 --> 00:18:53,778
Obligations? What is his deal?

316
00:18:53,863 --> 00:18:55,718
Look, I don’t know. Could you just excuse me?

317
00:18:55,825 --> 00:19:00,393
Well, I was gonna say, my parents usually close this place down every year,

318
00:19:00,694 --> 00:19:03,862
so if you wanted, we could go back to my place and start the party early.

319
00:19:05,537 --> 00:19:06,551
We have a Jacuzzi.

320
00:19:08,723 --> 00:19:13,213
- That sounds tempting, Brooke...
- We have a naked me in a Jacuzzi.

321
00:19:15,557 --> 00:19:19,935
Okay. Um, what if I told you there was someone else?

322
00:19:20,012 --> 00:19:21,626
Normally, I’d suggest a threesome,

323
00:19:22,055 --> 00:19:26,715
but I think the person you have in mind is getting back together with her old boyfriend.

324
00:19:29,935 --> 00:19:32,070
So, uh, did you get my messages?

325
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:33,574
Yeah, I got all of them.

326
00:19:34,204 --> 00:19:35,915
I don’t blame you for not calling me back.

327
00:19:36,071 --> 00:19:37,425
Are you being self-deprecating?

328
00:19:37,696 --> 00:19:40,523
Probably… if I knew what that meant.

329
00:19:43,656 --> 00:19:46,263
Do you want to, uh… Do you want to go somewhere and talk?

330
00:19:48,941 --> 00:19:50,886
Just to talk, Peyton.

331
00:19:55,723 --> 00:19:56,825
Just to talk.

332
00:20:02,966 --> 00:20:04,611
See what I mean?

333
00:20:16,548 --> 00:20:20,081
Karen Roe… in Dan Scott’s house…

334
00:20:20,494 --> 00:20:22,508
with Keith Scott as her date.

335
00:20:23,834 --> 00:20:25,092
Nothing gets past you, Shari.

336
00:20:25,748 --> 00:20:28,073
- Well, Keith and I are just friends.
- Oh, of course you are.

337
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:31,002
Um, one Scott brother to the next-

338
00:20:31,467 --> 00:20:34,405
You practically need a scorecard around here to keep up with you people.

339
00:20:34,493 --> 00:20:37,718
Karen, there you are. I need your expert opinion in the kitchen.

340
00:20:37,975 --> 00:20:39,639
- Excuse us, Shari.
- Oh, yeah.

341
00:20:40,688 --> 00:20:42,143
You’re lucky she didn’t knee you.

342
00:20:47,825 --> 00:20:50,929
So, I see you smiling at school a lot. That’s good.

343
00:20:51,737 --> 00:20:52,507
You’ve been looking?

344
00:20:53,422 --> 00:20:54,421
Yeah, sometimes.

345
00:21:00,012 --> 00:21:04,312
Anyway, uh… Look, I don’t know if Brooke is just playing games or what.

346
00:21:04,773 --> 00:21:06,896
She said you were into us getting back together.

347
00:21:07,943 --> 00:21:09,842
Funny. She told me the same thing.

348
00:21:11,675 --> 00:21:12,299
Right.

349
00:21:13,570 --> 00:21:14,619
Look, the thing is…

350
00:21:16,463 --> 00:21:18,945
Oh. Sorry. We’ll come back.

351
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:20,569
But there’s vodka in the drawer.

352
00:21:20,636 --> 00:21:23,262
Tim, later. These two need some space.

353
00:21:23,523 --> 00:21:25,331
You know what, Brooke? Give it up.

354
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:27,276
Trust me, I’m trying.

355
00:21:27,768 --> 00:21:30,010
- You know what I mean.
- I’m just trying to help.

356
00:21:30,190 --> 00:21:31,056
Help with what?

357
00:21:31,448 --> 00:21:34,393
Get me out of the way so you can go embarrass yourself in front of Lucas?

358
00:21:36,876 --> 00:21:39,232
That’s funny. I didn’t realize you were in my way.

359
00:21:40,337 --> 00:21:41,556
Are you finally fessing up?

360
00:21:43,149 --> 00:21:45,094
Or, are you finally denying it?

361
00:21:55,446 --> 00:21:56,916
What the hell is wrong with you, Brooke?

362
00:22:29,179 --> 00:22:32,920
Nathan, Believing you will do well is half the battle… Call me if you need anything at all! Haley

363
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:40,749
Perfect.

364
00:22:44,998 --> 00:22:46,370
Thought I’d find you near the bar.

365
00:22:49,038 --> 00:22:49,908
It’s club soda.

366
00:22:50,523 --> 00:22:52,155
Well, that’s a good thing considering.

367
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:54,168
How ‘bout we don’t do this right now, huh?

368
00:22:54,297 --> 00:22:55,731
How about you meet me halfway.

369
00:22:56,406 --> 00:22:59,898
I say I'm sorry, you say you're sorry, we shake hands and go from there.

370
00:23:01,802 --> 00:23:02,785
It works for me.

371
00:23:02,888 --> 00:23:06,150
Well, you see, that’s the problem, Dan. It always has to work for you.

372
00:23:06,631 --> 00:23:08,873
Okay. How ‘bout we don’t do this right now.

373
00:23:12,356 --> 00:23:16,087
You in the mood to apologize, Dan? Why don’t you start with Karen

374
00:23:16,733 --> 00:23:19,154
or Lucas or maybe even Nathan, hmm?

375
00:23:19,333 --> 00:23:21,054
I’m gonna do you a solid, big brother.

376
00:23:22,442 --> 00:23:23,435
Just walk away.

377
00:23:29,742 --> 00:23:31,735
This is a very nice kitchen.

378
00:23:31,984 --> 00:23:35,503
Oh, thanks. I’m afraid it’s wasted on me.

379
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:37,930
Where did you learn to cook?

380
00:23:38,513 --> 00:23:41,227
Oh, books, trial and error,

381
00:23:42,062 --> 00:23:43,734
a lot of burnt casseroles.

382
00:23:44,796 --> 00:23:46,915
And I get to experiment a lot at the café.

383
00:23:47,033 --> 00:23:48,810
Oh, I’ll have to eat there some night.

384
00:23:49,485 --> 00:23:50,996
Don’t worry, I’ll come alone.

385
00:23:51,636 --> 00:23:58,286
Hi. There’s been a mix-up. The baker seems to have delivered the cakes to a bar mitzvah in Charlotte.

386
00:23:58,390 --> 00:24:02,009
You know, I have a lot of desserts at the café. I’d be happy to contribute.

387
00:24:02,101 --> 00:24:04,901
Oh no, I don’t want to put you to that trouble.

388
00:24:04,973 --> 00:24:07,514
No, no. It’s no trouble. I’ll call Haley.

389
00:24:08,901 --> 00:24:10,626
Haley? Um…

390
00:24:11,896 --> 00:24:13,528
is she a tutor, by any chance?

391
00:24:14,732 --> 00:24:15,966
Yeah, she is. Why?

392
00:24:16,145 --> 00:24:17,714
Oh, no. It’s a small world.

393
00:24:17,875 --> 00:24:20,058
She must be the girl who’s helping Nathan.

394
00:24:21,062 --> 00:24:22,944
Oh. She must be.

395
00:24:30,379 --> 00:24:31,747
Haven’t seen you much today.

396
00:24:32,478 --> 00:24:35,089
Yeah, I know. Every time I get within about five feet of you-

397
00:24:35,156 --> 00:24:36,012
Brooke happens.

398
00:24:36,821 --> 00:24:37,572
Or Nathan.

399
00:24:38,935 --> 00:24:39,872
Loose ends.

400
00:24:41,162 --> 00:24:42,304
Those are all tied up now.

401
00:24:45,242 --> 00:24:46,636
Looks like she got you

402
00:24:47,654 --> 00:24:48,621
right here.

403
00:24:50,042 --> 00:24:52,109
Listen up, everybody…

404
00:24:52,917 --> 00:24:54,510
it’s time to play truth or dare.

405
00:24:55,277 --> 00:24:59,153
Or maybe just dare, ‘cause nobody really tells the truth anymore.

406
00:25:01,151 --> 00:25:07,126
Let’s see… Theresa, I dare you…

407
00:25:08,759 --> 00:25:10,670
to go pinch Whitey’s ass.

408
00:25:13,705 --> 00:25:15,020
Be right back.

409
00:25:19,062 --> 00:25:21,999
- Let’s see… Peyton?
- Brooke, come on.

410
00:25:22,291 --> 00:25:26,480
I dare you to show us how you really feel. Kiss Lucas.

411
00:25:58,393 --> 00:25:59,964
Why are you being such a bitch tonight, Brooke?

412
00:26:01,741 --> 00:26:03,456
Well, I thought you liked that in a girl.

413
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:04,987
You should put some ice on it.

414
00:26:23,169 --> 00:26:23,916
So that was…

415
00:26:25,406 --> 00:26:26,077
Yeah.

416
00:26:27,531 --> 00:26:29,523
What was that exactly?

417
00:26:30,541 --> 00:26:31,253
A game?

418
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,070
Kind of.

419
00:26:37,879 --> 00:26:38,631
Not really.

420
00:26:41,049 --> 00:26:41,908
Want to play again?

421
00:26:52,850 --> 00:26:55,579
Sorry. Uh, sorry. I just…

422
00:26:56,459 --> 00:26:59,584
Your mom called with an SOS, so I just thought I’d sneak in the back

423
00:26:59,618 --> 00:27:02,040
- and not bother anyone. 
- You need some help?

424
00:27:02,599 --> 00:27:03,756
No. I’ll...

425
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:06,294
You’ve got your hands full.

426
00:27:06,909 --> 00:27:08,901
So, I’m just gonna-carry on.

427
00:27:18,455 --> 00:27:20,691
Everything you need…

428
00:27:22,721 --> 00:27:24,195
for a first class sugar coma.

429
00:27:24,399 --> 00:27:26,176
Oh, let’s see.

430
00:27:27,435 --> 00:27:30,446
Oh, these cakes are gorgeous. Who makes them?

431
00:27:31,275 --> 00:27:32,300
These guys.

432
00:27:32,822 --> 00:27:35,783
Thank you, Haley. The caterers can take it from here.

433
00:27:36,796 --> 00:27:38,950
Go join your friends. Have some food.

434
00:27:39,064 --> 00:27:42,319
No, that’s okay. I have to get back, anyway. I’m still on the clock.

435
00:27:42,448 --> 00:27:44,850
Did you lock up when you left, turn off the coffee machine?

436
00:27:44,925 --> 00:27:45,489
Yeah.

437
00:27:45,821 --> 00:27:46,999
Well, then you’re off the clock.

438
00:27:47,251 --> 00:27:50,159
Great, then it’s settled. Uh, I’ll get some waiters to serve these.

439
00:27:53,199 --> 00:27:54,245
She seems kind of cool.

440
00:27:55,651 --> 00:27:56,507
How are you holding up?

441
00:27:56,953 --> 00:28:00,193
Well, I haven’t had to, uh-caw!-yet.

442
00:28:00,598 --> 00:28:02,165
Okay, whatever that means.

443
00:28:04,361 --> 00:28:05,898
- Haley?
- Hmm?

444
00:28:06,327 --> 00:28:08,498
Why didn’t you tell me it was Nathan you were tutoring?

445
00:28:09,103 --> 00:28:10,322
Oh, uh…

446
00:28:12,087 --> 00:28:13,663
it just seemed kind of weird.

447
00:28:14,207 --> 00:28:17,970
Lucas wasn’t really happy about it, so I just figured you wouldn’t be too happy about it.

448
00:28:18,119 --> 00:28:20,061
I wasn’t even sure if I was happy about it.

449
00:28:20,142 --> 00:28:20,889
And now?

450
00:28:21,474 --> 00:28:25,538
Um…now things are okay with Lucas and with me.

451
00:28:26,142 --> 00:28:27,007
And with me.

452
00:28:28,421 --> 00:28:29,741
Now go, have fun.

453
00:28:30,716 --> 00:28:32,348
It only comes around once.

454
00:28:33,238 --> 00:28:34,012
Okay.

455
00:28:42,399 --> 00:28:44,646
You know, I can’t believe I’m gonna say this, but, um,

456
00:28:45,691 --> 00:28:46,699
I’m glad I came.

457
00:28:49,212 --> 00:28:50,647
So, what do we do now?

458
00:28:52,798 --> 00:28:53,893
I don’t know.

459
00:28:54,313 --> 00:28:56,248
What happens next in the story you were telling me about?

460
00:28:59,254 --> 00:28:59,914
Come on.

461
00:29:09,284 --> 00:29:09,907
Haley?

462
00:29:10,969 --> 00:29:15,126
Hey! Um, I’m not crashing. I promise. Your mom just wanted some cakes.

463
00:29:15,888 --> 00:29:16,575
Cakes?

464
00:29:16,867 --> 00:29:20,766
Yeah. It’s a long story. She invited me to stay and I sort of had a brain freeze

465
00:29:20,818 --> 00:29:24,188
and said "sure"…and it’s probably really weird. I’m actually gonna leave.

466
00:29:24,285 --> 00:29:26,022
No, no, no. I’m glad you came.

467
00:29:26,566 --> 00:29:29,305
- Really?
- Yeah. I mean, I’d even study right now.

468
00:29:29,569 --> 00:29:31,607
It’d be a hell of a lot more fun than this suck-fest.

469
00:29:31,926 --> 00:29:35,176
- Sorry. I’m off-duty.
- Well, then let me get you a drink.

470
00:29:35,616 --> 00:29:36,359
Okay.

471
00:29:37,997 --> 00:29:39,108
Tutor girl!

472
00:29:40,343 --> 00:29:41,603
- It’s Haley.
- Brooke…

473
00:29:41,786 --> 00:29:46,302
Haley, right. Nathan’s own personal little care package.

474
00:29:46,389 --> 00:29:49,027
Everything’s starting to make so much more sense now.

475
00:29:49,339 --> 00:29:50,818
You two are adorable.

476
00:29:51,301 --> 00:29:56,414
What was my favorite part? "Believing you’ll do well is half the battle…"

477
00:29:56,614 --> 00:30:00,398
You know, Tutor Girl’s little love note you passed around earlier-

478
00:30:00,525 --> 00:30:06,102
the one that said, "Call me if you need anything… at all."

479
00:30:06,991 --> 00:30:09,727
All right, Haley, I...

480
00:30:09,788 --> 00:30:10,899
Stay away from me.

481
00:30:17,131 --> 00:30:18,691
Games are getting old, Brooke.

482
00:30:24,349 --> 00:30:27,555
Cover me. Shari’s proposing a couples cruise.

483
00:30:27,657 --> 00:30:28,538
Oh no.

484
00:30:32,484 --> 00:30:36,355
I have to confess something. I have been pretty judgmental about you.

485
00:30:37,917 --> 00:30:41,144
- How could you not be? 
- I really didn’t want to like you.

486
00:30:42,398 --> 00:30:44,518
I’m hoping there’s a "but" in there somewhere.

487
00:30:44,999 --> 00:30:47,850
There is. I was wrong.

488
00:30:48,521 --> 00:30:51,542
I’m really glad I’ve had this chance to get to know you.

489
00:30:51,655 --> 00:30:54,321
Oh, that make’s two of us.

490
00:30:56,150 --> 00:30:59,627
There are so many questions.

491
00:30:59,852 --> 00:31:01,423
That makes two of us again.

492
00:31:02,601 --> 00:31:03,333
You start.

493
00:31:03,983 --> 00:31:08,075
When you met Dan, did he tell you about me?

494
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:11,311
He said he’d had a girlfriend in high school.

495
00:31:13,298 --> 00:31:17,178
- Did you know I was pregnant?
- He conveniently left that out.

496
00:31:17,705 --> 00:31:21,679
I didn’t find out about you until we were married and living in Tree Hill.

497
00:31:22,391 --> 00:31:24,980
- Oh, I would’ve killed him.
- Oh, I almost did.

498
00:31:27,343 --> 00:31:32,615
- So when did you...
- Dan and I met at Freshman Orientation.

499
00:31:34,162 --> 00:31:37,576
That was about a month after I told him I was pregnant.

500
00:31:38,181 --> 00:31:39,968
A few months later, I was pregnant, too.

501
00:31:41,570 --> 00:31:44,965
You know Dan, always the overachiever.

502
00:31:49,374 --> 00:31:51,989
Don’t take this the wrong way, Karen.

503
00:31:52,123 --> 00:31:54,784
But I’m glad I didn’t know about you back then

504
00:31:57,105 --> 00:32:00,469
because if I did I wouldn’t have Nathan.

505
00:32:03,259 --> 00:32:04,462
I know what you mean.

506
00:32:07,155 --> 00:32:08,292
I love my son,

507
00:32:09,501 --> 00:32:13,064
but sometimes I wonder how I could have been that reckless.

508
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:17,140
We were kids.

509
00:32:29,623 --> 00:32:30,540
Don’t need this...

510
00:32:32,993 --> 00:32:34,323
or this.

511
00:32:46,771 --> 00:32:48,306
I’ve wanted this for so long.

512
00:32:48,572 --> 00:32:51,818
Me too. And now we can have it.

513
00:32:51,956 --> 00:32:54,220
No, no, no. I don’t mean just that.

514
00:32:55,224 --> 00:32:56,529
I want this.

515
00:32:58,963 --> 00:33:02,453
You know? I want to be here.

516
00:33:04,654 --> 00:33:08,014
I want to have everything with you. I want it all.

517
00:33:12,432 --> 00:33:14,863
I want us, Peyton.

518
00:33:16,016 --> 00:33:17,516
Hey, what’s wrong?

519
00:33:18,965 --> 00:33:21,161
- This isn’t supposed to be that.
- Peyton...

520
00:33:21,515 --> 00:33:23,035
Why couldn’t you just leave it alone?

521
00:33:44,101 --> 00:33:45,220
Interesting.

522
00:33:46,894 --> 00:33:48,733
You’ve always made me out to be the bad guy.

523
00:33:50,242 --> 00:33:51,922
Maybe you’ll judge me a little different now.

524
00:33:51,995 --> 00:33:52,879
Spare me a lecture.

525
00:33:53,224 --> 00:33:54,954
Just trying to give you the benefit of my experience.

526
00:33:55,056 --> 00:33:58,979
In what-fathering a child… or abandoning one?

527
00:34:01,938 --> 00:34:04,230
Seems to me you’re one mistake away from both.

528
00:34:04,298 --> 00:34:07,217
Yeah, well, one’s an accident.

529
00:34:08,451 --> 00:34:09,581
The other’s a choice.

530
00:34:10,926 --> 00:34:12,198
Excuse me.

531
00:34:21,008 --> 00:34:21,799
Excuse me.

532
00:34:24,143 --> 00:34:24,999
"Caw?"

533
00:34:25,444 --> 00:34:27,957
Hey, listen, you guys can stay if you want. I think I’m gonna cut out.

534
00:34:28,044 --> 00:34:31,505
- What happened?
- Nothing. I’m just done is all.

535
00:34:31,771 --> 00:34:33,129
All right. Well, let me go grab my coat.

536
00:34:33,297 --> 00:34:36,570
Hey, take your time. You guys go ahead. I’ll be in the car, all right?

537
00:34:41,418 --> 00:34:43,420
- Lucas…
- Come on, Brooke. Not now.

538
00:34:47,578 --> 00:34:48,293
Jake…

539
00:34:49,468 --> 00:34:51,039
Jake, Jake, Jake.

540
00:34:51,192 --> 00:34:52,877
Oh, Brooke, Brooke, Brooke.

541
00:34:53,210 --> 00:34:55,263
I’m drunk. You’ll do.

542
00:34:55,354 --> 00:34:59,952
Oh, oh, hey, um, it’s quite an honor, but I got to be somewhere.

543
00:35:00,249 --> 00:35:03,246
Oh, right-the big mystery.

544
00:35:04,244 --> 00:35:07,433
- Yeah. Anyway, I should... 
- What’s going on anyway?

545
00:35:08,324 --> 00:35:11,570
Lucas turns me down. You turn me down.

546
00:35:12,139 --> 00:35:15,892
Oh, my god! I got it! You’re both gay. That totally explains it.

547
00:35:16,111 --> 00:35:19,092
Yeah, yeah, we are. We’re actually-we’re gay.

548
00:35:19,762 --> 00:35:20,955
Whatever you say, Brooke.

549
00:35:21,425 --> 00:35:22,589
Then what is it?

550
00:35:23,208 --> 00:35:25,983
Come on, you can tell me. I won’t even remember tomorrow.

551
00:35:26,453 --> 00:35:27,217
You want to know?

552
00:35:30,033 --> 00:35:32,086
The truth would kill your buzz.

553
00:35:38,852 --> 00:35:41,226
Deb put this room together for me a few Christmas’s ago.

554
00:35:41,563 --> 00:35:42,347
It’s nice.

555
00:35:43,504 --> 00:35:45,443
Anyway, I just came to get my coat.

556
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:47,870
Karen, why are you doing this?

557
00:35:48,444 --> 00:35:49,073
For Lucas.

558
00:35:50,784 --> 00:35:51,762
And for me.

559
00:35:52,008 --> 00:35:54,492
For you? What do you get out of it?

560
00:35:54,782 --> 00:35:55,796
I get to move on.

561
00:35:57,344 --> 00:35:58,853
And that’s pretty liberating.

562
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:06,345
Look around you, Dan. You have a wonderful life.

563
00:36:07,624 --> 00:36:10,113
Why are you spending it stuck in the past?

564
00:36:23,238 --> 00:36:24,061
Haley?

565
00:36:29,727 --> 00:36:30,762
Hey, Hales!

566
00:36:37,817 --> 00:36:38,896
Is this floor taken?

567
00:36:47,007 --> 00:36:51,719
You know, just this once, I deserve a big, fat "I told you so."

568
00:36:52,589 --> 00:36:54,114
Well, you won’t get it from me.

569
00:36:55,445 --> 00:36:56,250
What happened?

570
00:36:57,750 --> 00:37:00,079
Exactly what you told me was gonna happen.

571
00:37:01,938 --> 00:37:05,773
I started believing that he wasn’t terrible, and he proved me wrong.

572
00:37:06,045 --> 00:37:10,970
Once again, the smart girl is really stupid.

573
00:37:11,052 --> 00:37:12,064
Hey, hey.

574
00:37:16,002 --> 00:37:17,493
You are not stupid.

575
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:20,319
Thanks.

576
00:37:24,196 --> 00:37:27,456
Well, at least things are working out for one of us.

577
00:37:27,512 --> 00:37:29,479
It looks like you and Peyton are headed in the right direction.

578
00:37:29,607 --> 00:37:30,942
Well, if it’ll make you feel better,

579
00:37:32,198 --> 00:37:34,558
that lasted all of about five minutes.

580
00:37:36,467 --> 00:37:38,588
It doesn’t make me feel any better.

581
00:37:41,091 --> 00:37:42,233
Well, welcome back.

582
00:37:43,473 --> 00:37:44,184
To where?

583
00:37:45,145 --> 00:37:45,775
Normal.

584
00:37:47,690 --> 00:37:48,387
Yeah.

585
00:37:49,810 --> 00:37:51,070
They can have their world.

586
00:37:55,335 --> 00:37:57,409
Come on. Let me help you close up.

587
00:37:57,511 --> 00:37:59,887
No, thanks. I’ll do it. I just…

588
00:38:00,763 --> 00:38:03,343
I just want to be alone for a little while, okay?

589
00:38:04,566 --> 00:38:07,664
I’ll be fine. I’ll be okay. I’m okay.

590
00:38:08,631 --> 00:38:09,543
All right.

591
00:38:23,696 --> 00:38:25,405
Great party, as always, Dan.

592
00:38:25,554 --> 00:38:26,577
Oh, thanks, Peter.

593
00:38:26,649 --> 00:38:30,735
Deb, honey, you got to send me the number for the caterer. Those cakes were to die for.

594
00:38:30,838 --> 00:38:33,692
Oh, it’s in the book under "Karen’s Café."

595
00:38:34,192 --> 00:38:36,664
Really? Well, who knew?

596
00:38:38,744 --> 00:38:40,068
- Good night.
- Bye-bye.

597
00:38:41,963 --> 00:38:44,467
So, was it all you wanted it to be?

598
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,319
‘Cause, I think it’s the first year I’ve actually enjoyed myself.

599
00:38:48,308 --> 00:38:50,150
Might have even made a new friend.

600
00:38:51,988 --> 00:38:52,663
I noticed.

601
00:38:55,777 --> 00:38:58,393
Thank you for being on your best behavior.

602
00:38:59,377 --> 00:39:01,348
You really stepped up.

603
00:39:06,161 --> 00:39:06,883
Did I?

604
00:39:08,748 --> 00:39:11,260
‘Cause I can’t ever remember feeling more off-balance.

605
00:39:50,465 --> 00:39:51,341
Hey.

606
00:39:59,284 --> 00:40:00,115
Can I come in?

607
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:09,362
Haley, I didn’t know.

608
00:40:09,946 --> 00:40:10,930
Come on.

609
00:40:12,789 --> 00:40:14,589
Please, you got to believe me.

610
00:40:52,343 --> 00:40:53,637
Sweet dreams, baby.

611
00:40:54,790 --> 00:40:56,635
Daddy loves you, all right?

612
