1
00:00:00,446 --> 00:00:02,318
Previously on One Tree Hill.

2
00:00:02,785 --> 00:00:04,227
You’re Nathan, right?

3
00:00:04,315 --> 00:00:06,251
Yeah, do I… do I know you?

4
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:08,267
Well you should; I’m your sister-in-law.

5
00:00:08,421 --> 00:00:11,990
Dude, the thing is… when I saw her; I got that déjà vu thing.

6
00:00:12,051 --> 00:00:13,479
So you probably saw her around school.

7
00:00:13,566 --> 00:00:15,891
She was kinda the first girl I ever had sex with.

8
00:00:15,967 --> 00:00:18,630
Nice work, Jules. Just like we planned.

9
00:00:18,866 --> 00:00:20,514
What did Dan ask you to do?

10
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:22,967
Make Keith fall in love with me.

11
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:26,305
Then break his heart.

12
00:00:26,561 --> 00:00:29,551
Dan’s heart condition; is it genetic?

13
00:00:29,643 --> 00:00:31,856
- Yes. 
- You are taking the test.

14
00:00:31,942 --> 00:00:34,410
There were these… rumours that got started.

15
00:00:34,477 --> 00:00:36,428
But the thing is, they were true.

16
00:00:36,888 --> 00:00:39,438
- What were the rumours? 
- That I like girls.

17
00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:42,208
I won’t say anything.

18
00:00:44,716 --> 00:00:46,028
I can’t do this.

19
00:00:46,233 --> 00:00:47,395
You’re not ready.

20
00:01:47,817 --> 00:01:48,925
Mom, what’s going on?

21
00:01:49,006 --> 00:01:51,913
You wanna live in my house - against my rules?

22
00:01:52,359 --> 00:01:54,662
You’re sure as hell not gonna be comfortable doing it.

23
00:01:56,972 --> 00:01:58,001
The heart test?

24
00:02:00,262 --> 00:02:02,495
Look, I’m sorry mom, but this is my life.

25
00:02:02,849 --> 00:02:05,803
You know, if I’d been that selfish at your age,

26
00:02:05,911 --> 00:02:07,796
you might not be here right now!

27
00:02:09,183 --> 00:02:11,092
You can’t make me take this test, mom.

28
00:02:12,153 --> 00:02:13,969
Yeah, well we’ll see about that.

29
00:02:14,058 --> 00:02:15,096
Hey, Mom!

30
00:02:16,443 --> 00:02:17,487
Mom!?

31
00:02:19,418 --> 00:02:25,351
You seem like a decent kid… but most of the applicants at Carl’s Crab Shack have…

32
00:02:25,491 --> 00:02:27,283
have some work experience.

33
00:02:27,466 --> 00:02:31,020
Okay, fair enough. But I make up for my lack of experience in other ways;

34
00:02:31,102 --> 00:02:33,354
I am really good with people.

35
00:02:33,447 --> 00:02:36,734
I mean, my friends really like me and I know my crustaceans;

36
00:02:36,795 --> 00:02:39,550
lobsters, crab, shrimp - they’re all very… tasty.

37
00:02:39,652 --> 00:02:43,107
- Okay, now… I have your number...
- Look, Mr…

38
00:02:43,579 --> 00:02:47,147
Crab Shack Carl, I need this job.

39
00:02:47,567 --> 00:02:50,388
My car insurance is due, I am on my own

40
00:02:50,475 --> 00:02:53,005
and I can not lose my mode of transportation.

41
00:02:55,221 --> 00:02:58,120
Okay, I’m gonna give you a chance. You can start today.

42
00:02:58,197 --> 00:02:58,776
Okay.

43
00:02:58,853 --> 00:03:01,214
But, I don’t have any waitress slots open right now.

44
00:03:01,299 --> 00:03:04,346
This is more of a… a PR job.

45
00:03:04,459 --> 00:03:07,797
PR, oh PR is perfect for me.

46
00:03:09,886 --> 00:03:13,332
Come get the crabs at Carl’s Crab Shack.

47
00:03:14,208 --> 00:03:18,611
Crab cakes, crab steaks and creamy crab shakes.

48
00:03:19,819 --> 00:03:22,840
Come get the crabs at Carls Crab Shack.

49
00:03:32,783 --> 00:03:35,148
If you came by for a game, Lucas, you know I can’t let you play.

50
00:03:36,695 --> 00:03:37,985
What’re you doing to Keith?

51
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:40,663
You mean Keith Scott; the new VP at Dan Scott motors?

52
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:42,757
Company car, six figure salary, Keith Scott?

53
00:03:42,844 --> 00:03:43,996
With Jules?!

54
00:03:45,966 --> 00:03:48,548
She told me everything. Don’t deny it.

55
00:03:52,352 --> 00:03:54,912
And I wanted to believe that you’d somehow changed.

56
00:03:56,632 --> 00:03:58,066
Keith slept with Deb!

57
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:04,932
What kind of man sleeps with his brother’s wife?

58
00:04:05,607 --> 00:04:08,342
- You’re lying. 
- Am I? Ask him.

59
00:04:10,317 --> 00:04:13,026
The night I walked in on them was the night I had my heart attack.

60
00:04:14,525 --> 00:04:16,897
And I wanted revenge; just like any man would.

61
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:18,962
But after a few weeks I came to my senses;

62
00:04:19,897 --> 00:04:22,499
I couldn’t do that to my own brother, no matter what he did to me.

63
00:04:22,801 --> 00:04:25,325
That’s why I gave him the job – out of guilt…

64
00:04:25,693 --> 00:04:27,777
and I told Jules to leave town quietly.

65
00:04:28,346 --> 00:04:31,398
- Whatever, why should I believe anything you say anymore? 
- Because it’s the truth.

66
00:04:32,094 --> 00:04:33,901
I don’t know what she’s still doing here.

67
00:04:34,281 --> 00:04:35,944
Maybe she’s seen his paycheque.

68
00:04:50,613 --> 00:04:51,590
Shut that off!

69
00:04:51,677 --> 00:04:53,163
Is this the infamous Chris?

70
00:04:53,787 --> 00:04:54,873
Sounds sexy!

71
00:04:54,996 --> 00:04:57,664
Nathan is in the bedroom; do you wanna start World War Three?

72
00:05:01,314 --> 00:05:02,717
Nice henna tattoo.

73
00:05:02,977 --> 00:05:04,278
It’s not henna.

74
00:05:06,894 --> 00:05:08,615
It… is real!

75
00:05:08,954 --> 00:05:11,657
23? That how many tequila shots it took you to do it?

76
00:05:11,779 --> 00:05:12,722
Stop it!

77
00:05:12,824 --> 00:05:17,556
Hey, what happened to the whole; tattoos are for sluts and burnouts sermon that you gave me?

78
00:05:17,636 --> 00:05:20,935
Uh, 23 is Nathan’s jersey number and you permanently marked your body

79
00:05:21,001 --> 00:05:22,768
with some random… spider.

80
00:05:22,865 --> 00:05:25,465
The scorpion paralyses its victims.

81
00:05:25,707 --> 00:05:27,422
Nothing random about that.

82
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:28,672
Yeah, I bet.

83
00:05:29,673 --> 00:05:31,482
You got a tattoo.

84
00:05:31,671 --> 00:05:35,875
And, conveniently, it’s… in the exact same spot as me.

85
00:05:36,173 --> 00:05:39,345
I guess you don’t disapprove of your older sister so much after all.

86
00:05:39,422 --> 00:05:40,902
Don’t flatter yourself.

87
00:05:43,467 --> 00:05:45,838
Does this mean you didn’t wait for the ring to give it up either?

88
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:48,204
I waited, until I was in love.

89
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:53,293
How about you, Nathan? Were you in love the first time you had sex?

90
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:54,496
- Tay! 
- What?!

91
00:05:54,589 --> 00:05:57,476
We’re family now, we shouldn’t… have secrets.

92
00:06:01,506 --> 00:06:05,155
It’s not really any of your business but the truth is…

93
00:06:05,473 --> 00:06:09,493
whoever my first was, wasn’t nearly as important as my last.

94
00:06:12,513 --> 00:06:13,533
Thank you.

95
00:06:30,202 --> 00:06:32,605
Now you’re sure that my staying here isn’t an inhibition?

96
00:06:33,116 --> 00:06:35,544
Of course not, we’ve got plenty of room.

97
00:06:35,812 --> 00:06:39,629
Well, the last time I had my hardwood floors refinished it took almost a week.

98
00:06:42,796 --> 00:06:45,191
- Hey, Lucas. 
- Hey, Andy.

99
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:49,761
Okay, if you need anything, you know, stereo, Playstation…

100
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:51,241
clean underwear...

101
00:06:53,214 --> 00:06:54,498
check the garage.

102
00:06:56,096 --> 00:06:57,325
Thanks, I will.

103
00:07:08,024 --> 00:07:13,171
Stupid little kids. One of them poured a soda down my hole and now I’m all sticky.

104
00:07:13,314 --> 00:07:14,452
Honey, that’s nothing.

105
00:07:14,655 --> 00:07:17,390
One time a gang of eight year olds pushed me into the fountain.

106
00:07:17,652 --> 00:07:19,622
Wanted to watch the lobster swim.

107
00:07:20,549 --> 00:07:24,333
- I’m Marla. 
- I’m Brooke, and you are so not a lobster!

108
00:07:29,130 --> 00:07:30,175
- Hi. 
- Hi.

109
00:07:30,261 --> 00:07:32,647
Yeah. So how long have you been doing this?

110
00:07:32,889 --> 00:07:34,173
Six weeks.

111
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:37,353
I used to be a giant beaver down at the lumber yard so at least I’m moving up.

112
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:41,086
It’s a sucky job but I really need the money, so.

113
00:07:41,198 --> 00:07:42,318
Tell me about it.

114
00:07:42,646 --> 00:07:45,463
Thirteen, fourteen, fifteen.

115
00:07:45,959 --> 00:07:46,998
That’s it?

116
00:07:48,213 --> 00:07:53,030
The six most humiliating hours of my life and I made fifteen dollars?!

117
00:07:53,124 --> 00:07:56,697
I deducted the usual fee for costume rental and dry-cleaning.

118
00:07:57,352 --> 00:08:00,660
That is a total racket! We bust our butts out there all day.

119
00:08:00,783 --> 00:08:03,547
I have a blister from this thing, okay?

120
00:08:03,638 --> 00:08:05,390
We should be getting hazard pay.

121
00:08:05,493 --> 00:08:07,556
Any of you other crabs feel this way?

122
00:08:10,384 --> 00:08:13,326
Well then, if you don’t like it,

123
00:08:13,509 --> 00:08:19,246
I guess it’s… goodbye car insurance, hello city bus.

124
00:08:31,447 --> 00:08:32,572
Hey, thanks.

125
00:08:33,376 --> 00:08:37,104
Dan Scott looking for recipes?

126
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:39,945
I have officially seen everything.

127
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:43,728
I was thinking about inviting Keith and his girlfriend over for dinner.

128
00:08:43,817 --> 00:08:46,284
They’re getting serious; time she met the family.

129
00:08:46,386 --> 00:08:48,362
Well, wouldn’t that be a little awkward?

130
00:08:48,439 --> 00:08:49,515
Why should it be?

131
00:08:50,412 --> 00:08:53,565
You and Karen both slept with me and you still figured out a way to be friends.

132
00:08:54,123 --> 00:08:55,300
Well, that’s what I mean.

133
00:08:55,552 --> 00:08:57,154
She seems like such a nice person,

134
00:08:57,257 --> 00:09:00,343
one night with our crazy family, she might skip town.

135
00:09:00,419 --> 00:09:01,827
Ah, I don’t think so.

136
00:09:03,827 --> 00:09:08,700
And this isn’t just another opportunity for you to… rip Keith apart?

137
00:09:08,776 --> 00:09:09,750
It isn’t.

138
00:09:10,794 --> 00:09:11,777
Promise.

139
00:09:14,118 --> 00:09:15,715
I’ll call Keith and set it up.

140
00:09:34,604 --> 00:09:35,656
Hello!

141
00:09:36,364 --> 00:09:38,800
Hey, it’s me. Uh… what’re you doing?

142
00:09:39,154 --> 00:09:40,777
Oh, nothing, just…

143
00:09:41,392 --> 00:09:42,547
thinking of you.

144
00:09:50,424 --> 00:09:53,332
So, Keith slept with Nathan’s mom?

145
00:09:54,104 --> 00:09:55,046
I don’t know.

146
00:09:55,671 --> 00:09:58,114
I mean, can’t really trust what Dan says.

147
00:09:58,462 --> 00:10:00,555
But you know Jules and Dan set Keith up?

148
00:10:02,045 --> 00:10:03,203
Are you gonna tell him?

149
00:10:03,586 --> 00:10:05,486
I mean, if I don’t,

150
00:10:06,101 --> 00:10:07,886
I’m basically lying to my uncle.

151
00:10:08,684 --> 00:10:12,107
And if you do, it’ll crush him.

152
00:10:12,936 --> 00:10:13,781
Yeah.

153
00:10:14,647 --> 00:10:18,967
I just can’t believe Jules. I mean, she says she loves Keith

154
00:10:19,792 --> 00:10:24,363
but, I mean, what kind of a person would do something like this in the first place? You know?

155
00:10:25,167 --> 00:10:28,234
Maybe Jules was a bad person when she went into it…

156
00:10:28,508 --> 00:10:30,681
but now her feelings for Keith are real.

157
00:10:31,148 --> 00:10:34,521
Or maybe it’s all just part of the lie.

158
00:10:36,728 --> 00:10:37,737
Thank you...

159
00:10:38,889 --> 00:10:40,634
for talking to me about this, Anna.

160
00:10:40,839 --> 00:10:45,274
It feels good to… have at least one person in my life that knows the truth.

161
00:10:46,154 --> 00:10:48,372
Well, you’re that person for me.

162
00:10:49,621 --> 00:10:52,914
Although, there is… one other person who knows.

163
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:53,845
Felix.

164
00:10:54,706 --> 00:10:56,092
Not hardly.

165
00:10:56,468 --> 00:10:57,383
Peyton.

166
00:10:57,593 --> 00:10:58,760
Ah, you told Peyton?

167
00:10:58,858 --> 00:11:02,805
No… but she… kind of found out when...

168
00:11:03,286 --> 00:11:04,669
I kind of kissed her.

169
00:11:08,325 --> 00:11:10,378
- Luke. 
- Hold on, hold on.

170
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:15,206
- I’m picturing that. 
- Okay, don’t be such a guy!

171
00:11:15,318 --> 00:11:18,657
It was only the single most embarrassing moment of my life!

172
00:11:18,718 --> 00:11:19,424
Sorry.

173
00:11:20,454 --> 00:11:24,611
Let’s just say – it didn’t end well and… now she’s avoiding me.

174
00:11:24,698 --> 00:11:26,766
No, no, it’s not that at all.

175
00:11:27,049 --> 00:11:29,715
She just… took a little road trip.

176
00:11:29,977 --> 00:11:31,263
She only told me and Brooke.

177
00:11:33,381 --> 00:11:35,572
- What? 
- Nah, it’s just kinda funny.

178
00:11:36,086 --> 00:11:38,502
Last time I kissed Peyton, it didn’t end well either.

179
00:11:49,153 --> 00:11:50,361
We have to talk.

180
00:11:52,439 --> 00:11:53,836
You didn’t call me back.

181
00:11:56,608 --> 00:11:58,030
So we still on for tomorrow night?

182
00:11:58,183 --> 00:11:59,130
Definitely.

183
00:11:59,294 --> 00:12:01,778
Well that’s good, cos I just got a call;

184
00:12:02,065 --> 00:12:04,676
we’re invited to dinner – at my brother, Dan’s, house.

185
00:12:15,537 --> 00:12:17,051
What the hell are you doing?

186
00:12:17,896 --> 00:12:21,986
Shopping. But, apparently, I’m the only James that got the good taste gene.

187
00:12:22,708 --> 00:12:24,142
You know what I’m talking about.

188
00:12:25,923 --> 00:12:28,207
We agreed to keep what happened between us a secret.

189
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:30,538
Relax, Nathan, Haley doesn’t have a clue.

190
00:12:32,749 --> 00:12:34,249
I went out on a limb for you.

191
00:12:39,789 --> 00:12:43,333
I said you could stay here because I knew you didn’t have anywhere else to go.

192
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:47,720
And I… really appreciate it.

193
00:12:48,151 --> 00:12:51,332
If you keep this up, I’ll throw you out on your ass.

194
00:12:52,610 --> 00:12:55,017
Or maybe I should tell Haley about our history;

195
00:12:56,427 --> 00:12:58,605
and then you’ll be the one out on your ass.

196
00:13:14,472 --> 00:13:16,582
How’d you like a crab leg up your ass?!

197
00:13:22,279 --> 00:13:25,916
Nice claws. I though you said you had a crappy new job.

198
00:13:25,992 --> 00:13:27,810
Why are you here; to make fun of me?

199
00:13:27,892 --> 00:13:31,132
No, I came to have lunch, and give my waitress girlfriend a big tip.

200
00:13:31,205 --> 00:13:34,143
Well surprise, I’m not a waitress, I’m a crab.

201
00:13:34,363 --> 00:13:36,202
Trust me, that’s no surprise.

202
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:39,987
I applied everywhere, okay? This was the only job I could get.

203
00:13:40,692 --> 00:13:42,305
At least I look good in red.

204
00:13:45,710 --> 00:13:48,586
Oh, Felix, come on! Felix, come on, no!

205
00:13:48,686 --> 00:13:50,077
- Just one. Just, come on. Come on! 
- No, don’t take a picture of me.

206
00:13:50,154 --> 00:13:51,890
No! Enough! Enough, okay?

207
00:13:51,965 --> 00:13:53,614
- Enough! Stop! 
- Wait a minute.

208
00:13:53,685 --> 00:13:56,523
Hey! Snap to it, Crabitha!

209
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:59,816
And no flirting with the sailors!

210
00:14:01,332 --> 00:14:02,252
Okay.

211
00:14:03,593 --> 00:14:06,804
Hey, Carl, I’m just curious.

212
00:14:06,902 --> 00:14:11,177
I’ve been at this for three hours, so, when do I get a break?

213
00:14:11,335 --> 00:14:14,521
State law says I don’t have to give you a break.

214
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:17,511
A shark stops swimming; it’ll drown.

215
00:14:17,598 --> 00:14:19,015
But I’m a crab!

216
00:14:19,127 --> 00:14:21,800
Whatever. It’s all fish!

217
00:14:23,511 --> 00:14:25,430
I hate that guy!

218
00:14:25,483 --> 00:14:27,991
I don’t know why any of the rest of the crabs put up with him.

219
00:14:28,057 --> 00:14:29,542
They probably need money, like you.

220
00:14:29,615 --> 00:14:31,917
Otherwise, you could all band together and pince him to death.

221
00:14:35,435 --> 00:14:37,135
Hey, Luke! What’s up?

222
00:14:37,227 --> 00:14:38,400
I need to talk to you.

223
00:14:38,477 --> 00:14:39,649
Is everything okay?

224
00:14:40,053 --> 00:14:41,763
Remember when we were in Charleston?

225
00:14:42,403 --> 00:14:44,744
And you said you’d done some things you weren’t proud of?

226
00:14:45,635 --> 00:14:46,501
Yeah.

227
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:48,302
Was it Deb?

228
00:14:49,189 --> 00:14:50,167
You and Deb?

229
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:52,459
It’s…

230
00:14:54,308 --> 00:14:56,204
it’s kinda complicated, Luke.

231
00:14:57,011 --> 00:14:58,824
No, not really!

232
00:14:59,428 --> 00:15:01,517
I mean, there’s some lines you just don’t cross!

233
00:15:01,983 --> 00:15:03,628
It was a mistake, I know.

234
00:15:04,216 --> 00:15:06,996
I know it’s no excuse but… I was lonely.

235
00:15:07,098 --> 00:15:09,591
Your mom had just turned down my proposal and…

236
00:15:10,098 --> 00:15:13,266
and it just… sorta happened.

237
00:15:13,349 --> 00:15:16,525
Look, its bad enough it was someone’s wife but Dan’s wife?!

238
00:15:17,297 --> 00:15:18,669
He’s never gonna let that go!

239
00:15:18,771 --> 00:15:20,732
I know you’re disappointed in me, Luke.

240
00:15:21,397 --> 00:15:23,610
I’m never gonna make a mistake like that again.

241
00:15:23,932 --> 00:15:25,176
I’m with Jules now.

242
00:15:25,509 --> 00:15:27,511
And I’m not gonna do anything to mess that up.

243
00:15:33,297 --> 00:15:36,717
So… things are going well? With you and Jules?

244
00:15:36,994 --> 00:15:40,557
Yeah. I never thought I’d feel this way again; after your mom.

245
00:15:43,789 --> 00:15:45,846
But… she’s the one Luke.

246
00:15:49,401 --> 00:15:52,288
Look, I’m not proud of what I did with Deb and…

247
00:15:53,614 --> 00:15:56,419
that’s the only reason that I kept a secret from you.

248
00:15:57,724 --> 00:15:59,223
You understand that, right?

249
00:16:03,131 --> 00:16:04,028
Sure.

250
00:16:21,671 --> 00:16:25,220
You know, I’ve been to Turkey; they have prisons more comfortable than this.

251
00:16:27,852 --> 00:16:30,432
Here, I swiped you some saltines.

252
00:16:32,449 --> 00:16:33,278
Thank you.

253
00:16:33,534 --> 00:16:34,784
Ah, just don’t tell the warden.

254
00:16:36,371 --> 00:16:37,825
You know, at least she’s creative.

255
00:16:37,958 --> 00:16:40,201
Single moms are the toughest. I guess they have to be.

256
00:16:40,283 --> 00:16:41,751
I think I kinda lost her.

257
00:16:41,916 --> 00:16:43,361
Or you could just take the test.

258
00:16:44,783 --> 00:16:45,905
I had to try.

259
00:16:46,986 --> 00:16:48,828
I mean, you know she’s just worried about you, right?

260
00:16:48,910 --> 00:16:51,050
Yeah, I know, but at a certain point, she needs to just…

261
00:16:51,183 --> 00:16:52,801
you know, trust me to do the right thing.

262
00:16:53,175 --> 00:16:53,948
Alright.

263
00:16:55,267 --> 00:16:58,316
Just… don’t be too hard on your mom.

264
00:16:59,857 --> 00:17:02,232
Sometimes, people do crazy things when they’re desperate.

265
00:17:03,251 --> 00:17:05,428
Family dinner was never part of the arrangement.

266
00:17:05,596 --> 00:17:07,798
It was my wife’s idea. Couldn’t talk her out of it.

267
00:17:08,048 --> 00:17:11,018
Just a simple dinner. Consider it overtime.

268
00:17:11,111 --> 00:17:13,563
I told you, I’m not doing this anymore.

269
00:17:14,177 --> 00:17:15,821
What Keith and I have is real.

270
00:17:15,994 --> 00:17:18,432
If that’s the case, why don’t you come over to dinner and convince me?

271
00:17:19,061 --> 00:17:21,238
Maybe we’ll discuss a change of plans.

272
00:17:25,375 --> 00:17:26,159
Hey.

273
00:17:26,875 --> 00:17:30,510
So, I was thinking about asking Karen if we could live here till Taylor’s gone;

274
00:17:30,587 --> 00:17:32,763
maybe like, put a mattress behind the counter or something.

275
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:36,183
Yeah… we need to talk about her.

276
00:17:36,265 --> 00:17:39,353
Ah-ha! Yeah, I warned you about her. Give Taylor and inch

277
00:17:39,419 --> 00:17:42,430
and she’ll take whatever the hell she wants. I know her a lot better than you do.

278
00:17:46,014 --> 00:17:47,115
Alright, Haley…

279
00:17:48,052 --> 00:17:51,160
we got married… so quickly, we never really…

280
00:17:51,261 --> 00:17:54,319
had the talk that most people have when they get engaged.

281
00:17:56,413 --> 00:17:59,279
About… you know, past relationships,

282
00:18:00,191 --> 00:18:01,645
sexual history.

283
00:18:01,733 --> 00:18:05,358
Ah, well that’s probably because I can give you mine in under ten seconds

284
00:18:05,409 --> 00:18:07,990
while yours is catalogued in the Library of Congress.

285
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:11,225
What’s going on?

286
00:18:12,615 --> 00:18:13,693
Alright.

287
00:18:14,507 --> 00:18:18,306
My first time… was at this party at my parent’s beach house.

288
00:18:19,372 --> 00:18:23,676
I was pretty wasted and I… never… really saw the girl again.

289
00:18:24,747 --> 00:18:25,736
Until now.

290
00:18:26,251 --> 00:18:27,477
Until now…?

291
00:18:28,648 --> 00:18:32,933
Haley, listen, I swear, I hadn’t even heard of you when this happened, okay?

292
00:18:32,990 --> 00:18:35,469
- Taylor? 
- I’m sorry, I just, look...

293
00:18:35,853 --> 00:18:38,735
she threatened to tell you and I just thought you should hear it from me.

294
00:18:39,545 --> 00:18:41,178
You slept with my sister?

295
00:18:41,264 --> 00:18:42,493
This was like two years ago! I...

296
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:46,778
Look, I didn’t know you; I didn’t even know there was gonna be a you.

297
00:18:49,621 --> 00:18:50,603
I should go.

298
00:18:52,196 --> 00:18:53,091
Haley?

299
00:19:32,997 --> 00:19:34,236
You’re home early.

300
00:19:34,723 --> 00:19:36,556
You’re home all the time.

301
00:19:37,314 --> 00:19:39,770
What’re you doing on my laptop? Cruising for jailbait?

302
00:19:40,077 --> 00:19:41,092
Excuse me?

303
00:19:41,912 --> 00:19:44,706
Well I heard your speciality is deflowering freshmen!

304
00:19:46,304 --> 00:19:48,066
So the Boy Scout told you.

305
00:19:48,496 --> 00:19:51,271
Quite a coincidence, huh? Eh, but look, look at it this way;

306
00:19:51,362 --> 00:19:52,765
now we can compare notes.

307
00:19:52,863 --> 00:19:54,425
It's not funny, Taylor!

308
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:56,436
Would you… let go!

309
00:19:58,455 --> 00:20:01,736
If you wanted to find someone I hadn’t slept with, you could’ve moved to Alaska.

310
00:20:01,802 --> 00:20:04,700
You know what, do you think my relationship with Nathan is just a big joke?!

311
00:20:04,772 --> 00:20:06,610
No! Of course not!

312
00:20:07,644 --> 00:20:10,138
But I think that Chris is a laugh riot.

313
00:20:11,203 --> 00:20:12,285
What are you talking about?

314
00:20:12,385 --> 00:20:16,226
I’m talking about you, bitching about your husband’s past when you have a present!

315
00:20:16,333 --> 00:20:19,185
I was online and I got an IM, or rather, you did.

316
00:20:19,676 --> 00:20:21,105
You’ve been kissing Chris.

317
00:20:21,244 --> 00:20:24,428
I don’t… I don’t know what you’re talking about.

318
00:20:24,545 --> 00:20:26,414
- Are you sleeping with him? 
- No!

319
00:20:30,752 --> 00:20:32,543
It’s not what it looks like, okay?

320
00:20:32,653 --> 00:20:37,704
Oh, really? Cos it seems to me like Saint Haley is just as bad as the rest of us!

321
00:20:40,003 --> 00:20:42,501
Taylor, Nathan can not find out about this.

322
00:20:45,779 --> 00:20:49,235
Fine, Hay – but you have to let me stay here.

323
00:20:49,348 --> 00:20:51,192
At least until I figure out what I’m doing.

324
00:21:05,593 --> 00:21:07,688
That costume is so sweaty.

325
00:21:07,785 --> 00:21:11,160
I had a rash all over my... Well anyways, I got a rash.

326
00:21:11,324 --> 00:21:14,037
I’ve got carpal tunnel from snapping my pincers all day long.

327
00:21:14,133 --> 00:21:18,348
Okay, you guys, we can stand around the break room and complain and…

328
00:21:18,593 --> 00:21:21,789
be crabby, or we can figure out a way to protect ourselves from that guy.

329
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:24,589
But if we wanna change things, we have to do it together.

330
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,887
So you wanna form, like, a Crab Union?

331
00:21:26,995 --> 00:21:29,637
I’m thinking more along the lines of a Crab Sorority.

332
00:21:29,857 --> 00:21:32,428
We make a list of our demands and we take them to management.

333
00:21:32,838 --> 00:21:34,824
Okay, look, it’s not a bad idea…

334
00:21:35,054 --> 00:21:37,789
but I’ve got a two year old at home. I really need this job.

335
00:21:38,633 --> 00:21:40,953
Besides, I’ve seen Carl fire people who make trouble.

336
00:21:41,025 --> 00:21:45,887
Okay, but what if I can find a way to guarantee that none of us get fired?

337
00:21:45,970 --> 00:21:47,132
Are you all on board?

338
00:21:48,048 --> 00:21:48,760
Yeah.

339
00:21:49,088 --> 00:21:49,759
Yeah.

340
00:21:49,898 --> 00:21:51,166
- You guys? 
- Yeah.

341
00:21:52,539 --> 00:21:53,400
Okay.

342
00:22:01,234 --> 00:22:02,543
What’re you doing?

343
00:22:03,834 --> 00:22:04,761
Nothing.

344
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:06,761
What’s up?

345
00:22:06,953 --> 00:22:10,737
Well, I didn’t know how soon I’d see you again after yesterday so...

346
00:22:10,823 --> 00:22:12,257
Yeah, I know, I...

347
00:22:14,228 --> 00:22:18,330
I’ve been thinking about that a lot. I came down pretty hard on ya.

348
00:22:20,024 --> 00:22:22,332
Yeah, you weren’t the only one running away to Charleston.

349
00:22:22,419 --> 00:22:25,405
Yeah, well, don’t worry. You weren’t any harder on me than I was on myself.

350
00:22:26,403 --> 00:22:28,788
But, that’s not what I wanna talk to you about.

351
00:22:28,932 --> 00:22:30,909
This... HCM thing.

352
00:22:31,139 --> 00:22:34,509
Look, I don’t care what mom told you. Right, I’m not taking the test.

353
00:22:34,601 --> 00:22:35,906
Yeah, that’s what I said.

354
00:22:37,544 --> 00:22:40,939
You know, we’ve got the same genes, Luke. I’m just as at risk as you are.

355
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:44,026
And I’ve been putting off the test too. You wanna know why?

356
00:22:45,353 --> 00:22:46,448
Because I’m scared.

357
00:22:47,237 --> 00:22:48,025
Yeah.

358
00:22:49,463 --> 00:22:50,257
Me too.

359
00:22:50,406 --> 00:22:54,297
But I’ve decided I’m gonna take the test; if it’ll give Jules piece of mind.

360
00:22:55,526 --> 00:22:57,063
Jules wants you to take the test?

361
00:22:57,155 --> 00:22:59,397
Ah, she’s been bugging me about it for three weeks.

362
00:22:59,626 --> 00:23:00,933
You know, just like your mom.

363
00:23:01,112 --> 00:23:03,611
You know, that’s what people do if they care about you, Luke.

364
00:23:05,868 --> 00:23:07,261
How bout we go together?

365
00:23:07,886 --> 00:23:09,007
Not for us,

366
00:23:10,333 --> 00:23:11,183
for them.

367
00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:14,879
Just give it some thought, huh?

368
00:23:17,419 --> 00:23:20,051
Okay, I… gotta get going.

369
00:23:20,154 --> 00:23:21,095
Hey, Keith.

370
00:23:24,142 --> 00:23:25,622
Thank you for being here for me.

371
00:23:25,713 --> 00:23:26,624
Always.

372
00:23:26,718 --> 00:23:29,170
And I just want you to know, I’m here for you, too.

373
00:23:30,249 --> 00:23:31,724
No matter what happens.

374
00:23:31,823 --> 00:23:33,512
Don’t worry about the test, Luke.

375
00:23:34,166 --> 00:23:35,745
Everything’s gonna be okay.

376
00:23:48,284 --> 00:23:50,715
Don’t worry, Nate. You don’t have to throw the ball at the river.

377
00:23:50,791 --> 00:23:52,036
Just here to watch.

378
00:23:56,741 --> 00:23:59,225
- What’s going on with you? 
- It’s a long story.

379
00:23:59,650 --> 00:24:01,984
Actually, it’s not a long story; uh…

380
00:24:02,890 --> 00:24:04,948
I kinda told Haley that I slept with Taylor.

381
00:24:07,985 --> 00:24:10,049
Guess I’m not the only one who doesn’t wanna go home.

382
00:24:14,922 --> 00:24:16,064
You know, I’ve been thinking lately.

383
00:24:16,699 --> 00:24:18,282
Maybe it’s okay to lie,

384
00:24:18,957 --> 00:24:20,969
if you’re doing it to protect somebody.

385
00:24:21,378 --> 00:24:22,330
Now you tell me.

386
00:24:23,939 --> 00:24:26,667
I mean, look, when you got together with Haley,

387
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:28,608
you were just doing it to screw with me, right?

388
00:24:29,181 --> 00:24:31,670
Yeah, pretty much.

389
00:24:32,663 --> 00:24:35,388
But… when she found out,

390
00:24:37,256 --> 00:24:38,670
she was able to forgive you.

391
00:24:38,741 --> 00:24:40,205
Yeah, but that’s all Haley.

392
00:24:40,938 --> 00:24:42,954
Why? What’d you do wrong?

393
00:24:43,615 --> 00:24:47,839
Nothing, really. I mean, at least I didn’t sleep with Taylor.

394
00:24:48,662 --> 00:24:52,918
Yeah, well, I better go home and try to get Haley to forgive me again.

395
00:24:54,592 --> 00:24:55,591
Alright, man.

396
00:25:15,552 --> 00:25:16,802
Am I in the right apartment?

397
00:25:17,899 --> 00:25:19,681
Where’s that… nasty incense smell?

398
00:25:19,798 --> 00:25:21,980
Oh, Taylor, went out for a jog.

399
00:25:24,059 --> 00:25:25,907
Does this mean you’re talking to me again?

400
00:25:27,310 --> 00:25:29,301
I’m really sorry, Nathan. I…

401
00:25:30,064 --> 00:25:31,349
overreacted.

402
00:25:33,014 --> 00:25:35,154
What happened with you and Taylor was a long time ago

403
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:38,087
and I just don’t… have any right to be angry.

404
00:25:39,587 --> 00:25:42,331
Wow, I am in the wrong apartment.

405
00:25:45,936 --> 00:25:46,951
Besides,

406
00:25:47,641 --> 00:25:50,631
the things we did in the past don’t mean anything, right?

407
00:25:51,185 --> 00:25:53,924
Well, you don’t have to worry anymore.

408
00:25:54,876 --> 00:25:58,890
I went through your family album and I haven’t… slept with any of your other sisters.

409
00:26:00,401 --> 00:26:01,532
Listen, Haley...

410
00:26:02,654 --> 00:26:07,271
Look, I don’t wanna hurt you. I don’t wanna lie to you either.

411
00:26:07,501 --> 00:26:09,268
I know how honest you are with me.

412
00:26:20,750 --> 00:26:23,430
Keith? Promise me we can talk later.

413
00:26:23,773 --> 00:26:26,784
We’ll have dinner first and then we’ll see if you’re still talking to me.

414
00:26:30,322 --> 00:26:32,713
Danny! This is Jules.

415
00:26:33,037 --> 00:26:35,529
Jules, this is my brother, Dan.

416
00:26:36,103 --> 00:26:38,212
Nice to meet you Jules. Come on in

417
00:26:53,540 --> 00:26:54,535
There you go.

418
00:26:54,621 --> 00:26:58,753
So, Jules, how does someone like you end up with someone like my brother?

419
00:26:59,496 --> 00:27:01,226
Just good luck I guess.

420
00:27:02,768 --> 00:27:04,652
Oh, come on, it’s gotta be more than that.

421
00:27:05,144 --> 00:27:06,833
What’s your story? Where’re you from?

422
00:27:07,212 --> 00:27:08,103
Texas.

423
00:27:09,522 --> 00:27:11,575
I thought you said you were from the mid-west.

424
00:27:12,788 --> 00:27:14,579
We’re from all over, really.

425
00:27:14,769 --> 00:27:15,783
Army bred.

426
00:27:18,119 --> 00:27:20,269
Deb, this chicken is fantastic.

427
00:27:20,356 --> 00:27:23,392
And I’m not just saying that cos you’re… kinda my boss.

428
00:27:23,479 --> 00:27:25,866
Well thanks but, actually, Dan made dinner.

429
00:27:28,889 --> 00:27:29,796
You okay?

430
00:27:30,073 --> 00:27:30,897
Yeah.

431
00:27:32,066 --> 00:27:34,451
So how are things going, down at the club?

432
00:27:34,549 --> 00:27:36,433
Great! We’ve been really busy.

433
00:27:36,514 --> 00:27:37,365
Well good.

434
00:27:39,192 --> 00:27:40,980
So, Keith, you’re dating a bartender.

435
00:27:41,169 --> 00:27:43,355
It’s like a dream come true for you, huh boozy?

436
00:27:44,537 --> 00:27:48,076
Must be fascinating work though; get to hear everyone’s dirty secrets.

437
00:27:48,650 --> 00:27:49,918
We all have them.

438
00:27:52,835 --> 00:27:55,361
I guess every bartender has to be part therapist.

439
00:27:55,438 --> 00:27:56,984
Well sure, but it’s gotta be tough;

440
00:27:57,271 --> 00:27:59,293
pretending to care about the poor bastards.

441
00:27:59,376 --> 00:28:00,809
I don’t have to pretend.

442
00:28:03,558 --> 00:28:08,048
Uh, Deb, you did a... You did a beautiful job –

443
00:28:08,131 --> 00:28:09,769
the table looks… just great.

444
00:28:09,872 --> 00:28:11,013
Thanks, Keith.

445
00:28:13,949 --> 00:28:18,647
You know, Jules… Deb and Keith have always been very close.

446
00:28:18,745 --> 00:28:20,573
They have a very special relationship.

447
00:28:20,681 --> 00:28:22,840
Not just in-laws, more…

448
00:28:23,203 --> 00:28:24,147
loving!

449
00:28:25,017 --> 00:28:26,988
Hopefully, you and I can carry on the tradition.

450
00:28:27,270 --> 00:28:30,720
Geez, Dan. Put it away and help me with desert.

451
00:28:30,828 --> 00:28:32,163
Sure, but first a toast.

452
00:28:34,555 --> 00:28:35,928
To Jules and Keith.

453
00:28:36,828 --> 00:28:38,170
And to honesty.

454
00:28:40,228 --> 00:28:42,184
The foundation of every good relationship.

455
00:28:53,515 --> 00:28:54,836
Look at these people.

456
00:28:55,195 --> 00:28:58,359
They all know what they want and… they manage to find it.

457
00:28:59,111 --> 00:29:00,621
Makes me kinda jealous.

458
00:29:03,104 --> 00:29:04,809
Okay, maybe not them.

459
00:29:06,485 --> 00:29:08,430
You probably think I’m weird, huh?

460
00:29:08,818 --> 00:29:10,134
Well, yeah.

461
00:29:10,806 --> 00:29:12,504
But I’ve thought that since I first met ya.

462
00:29:13,186 --> 00:29:14,201
It’s just that…

463
00:29:16,515 --> 00:29:19,299
You like girls, or you like guys.

464
00:29:20,429 --> 00:29:23,140
Trust me, I wish it was like that for me.

465
00:29:24,082 --> 00:29:26,294
Be a lot easier if I could just… pick a team.

466
00:29:26,416 --> 00:29:27,578
Well, not necessarily.

467
00:29:28,807 --> 00:29:33,092
Look, maybe you shouldn’t… feel so much pressure to define yourself.

468
00:29:34,516 --> 00:29:37,743
So… are you gonna take this HCM test, or what?

469
00:29:39,299 --> 00:29:41,330
Your mom tracked me down.

470
00:29:41,696 --> 00:29:45,632
Look, Luke, for selfish reasons – I think you should.

471
00:29:45,721 --> 00:29:48,228
I mean, as far as friends go, you’re all I’ve got.

472
00:29:48,761 --> 00:29:50,103
I can’t risk losing you.

473
00:29:53,358 --> 00:29:56,809
But what if it was your mom that was supposed to take this test?

474
00:29:57,249 --> 00:29:58,872
She’s the only mom you’ve got.

475
00:29:59,722 --> 00:30:01,658
Would you let her take that for granted?

476
00:30:11,221 --> 00:30:13,804
No, I do not have time right now. And just because we’re dating

477
00:30:13,828 --> 00:30:16,071
does not mean that you get a sexual season pass.

478
00:30:16,219 --> 00:30:17,198
What’s going on?

479
00:30:17,515 --> 00:30:20,219
I promised the other Crabs I’d figure out a way to make things better at work

480
00:30:20,269 --> 00:30:22,660
so I’m gonna look up dirt on this Carl guy.

481
00:30:23,684 --> 00:30:25,856
That, or you could go after him legally.

482
00:30:27,125 --> 00:30:28,134
How do you mean?

483
00:30:28,466 --> 00:30:30,503
Try looking on the state employment website.

484
00:30:30,643 --> 00:30:33,766
I mean, a guy like that’s bound to be breaking some type of small business law.

485
00:30:35,542 --> 00:30:37,478
I’ll get us some coffee and we can work all night.

486
00:30:38,414 --> 00:30:39,854
You’re gonna help me?

487
00:30:40,046 --> 00:30:41,246
Of course, Brooke.

488
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:42,505
You’re my girlfriend.

489
00:30:44,278 --> 00:30:45,511
Thanks.

490
00:30:46,294 --> 00:30:48,629
Besides, I’d have to if we’re ever gonna have sex again.

491
00:30:52,284 --> 00:30:53,192
Just kidding.

492
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:05,094
Those trophies are all for first place.

493
00:31:05,743 --> 00:31:06,820
Expect that one.

494
00:31:08,352 --> 00:31:09,514
Second place.

495
00:31:10,810 --> 00:31:12,734
My junior year against Malpilot.

496
00:31:13,450 --> 00:31:14,901
We would have won the game too…

497
00:31:15,403 --> 00:31:18,187
except the team tried to change the offence in mid-play.

498
00:31:22,621 --> 00:31:24,475
Is that what this dinner was all about?

499
00:31:25,754 --> 00:31:27,889
The dinner to remind you who you’re working for.

500
00:31:27,976 --> 00:31:32,600
I pay you; I give you a place it live. In exchange, you do exactly what I say.

501
00:31:32,682 --> 00:31:34,459
I don’t wanna do this anymore!

502
00:31:36,179 --> 00:31:37,694
I love Keith.

503
00:31:41,586 --> 00:31:43,603
You know, I’m as romantic as the next guy –

504
00:31:43,706 --> 00:31:46,635
and ordinarily, I’d let you guys ride off into the sunset together…

505
00:31:48,875 --> 00:31:51,073
- but you told my son. 
- He found out!

506
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:55,394
Well, from now on, you leave Lucas to me. Your only job is to finish what we started.

507
00:31:56,367 --> 00:31:57,713
Come on, Jules.

508
00:31:58,313 --> 00:32:00,867
It’d be different if you were gonna spend the rest of your life with him.

509
00:32:03,648 --> 00:32:06,741
Do you really think Keith would forgive you if he knew the truth?

510
00:32:17,718 --> 00:32:18,446
Hey.

511
00:32:19,654 --> 00:32:21,231
Sorry about your hair.

512
00:32:22,102 --> 00:32:23,913
Sorry I slept with your husband.

513
00:32:25,014 --> 00:32:27,174
If it’s any consolation, I’m not that memorable.

514
00:32:28,074 --> 00:32:29,351
Okay, that’s a lie.

515
00:32:32,219 --> 00:32:33,877
What am I gonna do, Taylor?

516
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:36,733
Hang in there, eventually, he’ll forget about me.

517
00:32:36,865 --> 00:32:38,388
No, I’m serious.

518
00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:44,348
I love Nathan and this is all really confusing.

519
00:32:46,590 --> 00:32:47,978
Because you kissed Chris?

520
00:32:48,505 --> 00:32:49,273
No.

521
00:32:50,179 --> 00:32:54,045
Because I’m… just jealous of what Chris has!

522
00:32:54,623 --> 00:32:57,736
You know, his music; the freedom to pursue his dream…

523
00:32:58,704 --> 00:33:02,283
and that… kiss just made it a lot messier.

524
00:33:06,245 --> 00:33:08,114
I really don’t know what to do.

525
00:33:10,598 --> 00:33:12,595
I am…

526
00:33:13,855 --> 00:33:16,306
the wrong girl to ask for advice.

527
00:33:17,950 --> 00:33:20,551
You wanna know why I really got the tattoo?

528
00:33:21,223 --> 00:33:23,091
When the scorpion’s caught in a fire,

529
00:33:23,449 --> 00:33:25,256
it stings itself to death.

530
00:33:26,214 --> 00:33:28,139
That’s a myth, actually.

531
00:33:28,594 --> 00:33:29,827
Not in my life. 

532
00:33:31,504 --> 00:33:35,527
When things get bad, I always… find a way to make them worse.

533
00:33:46,267 --> 00:33:47,518
Truth is, Hay,

534
00:33:48,763 --> 00:33:50,810
you’ve always been miles ahead of me.

535
00:33:53,018 --> 00:33:55,532
And most of the time, I feel like the little sister.

536
00:33:59,218 --> 00:34:01,123
You’ll do the right thing, Haley-bub...

537
00:34:02,889 --> 00:34:04,040
you always do.

538
00:34:18,336 --> 00:34:20,921
Hey, Luke. What’re you doing here?

539
00:34:21,019 --> 00:34:23,531
Nah, I just… wanted to see how you’re doing.

540
00:34:23,782 --> 00:34:27,417
Well actually I’m... I’m glad you stopped by.

541
00:34:27,757 --> 00:34:30,517
Something happened tonight; with Jules.

542
00:34:39,298 --> 00:34:40,926
I asked her to marry me.

543
00:34:46,203 --> 00:34:49,445
Hey, don’t look so worried. She said yes.

544
00:34:53,052 --> 00:34:54,110
That’s great.

545
00:35:01,611 --> 00:35:04,233
What are you standing around here for?

546
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:06,827
Get back to work!

547
00:35:06,931 --> 00:35:11,180
Oh, we will, soon as you agree to our list of demands.

548
00:35:11,333 --> 00:35:12,875
Demands? What is this?

549
00:35:12,952 --> 00:35:14,436
I’ve been doing some research.

550
00:35:14,538 --> 00:35:19,346
It turns out that uniform maintenance can not be deducted from our hourly wages.

551
00:35:19,535 --> 00:35:23,877
And these crab suits are not flame retardant which is a violation of O.S.H.A.

552
00:35:23,975 --> 00:35:25,430
- O.S.H.A? 
- Trust me.

553
00:35:25,527 --> 00:35:27,861
And there is plenty more where that came from.

554
00:35:27,953 --> 00:35:30,990
We are not singing our Crabby songs until you comply.

555
00:35:31,103 --> 00:35:37,590
Oh, okay, you win. Turn in your crabby suits. You’re all fired!

556
00:35:38,188 --> 00:35:42,591
I can snap my fingers, and get crabs whenever I want to.

557
00:35:43,083 --> 00:35:44,154
Okay.

558
00:35:44,670 --> 00:35:47,814
Girls, here you go. That’s for you.

559
00:35:48,015 --> 00:35:50,733
And you. That’s for you.

560
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:52,299
And what the hell is this?

561
00:35:52,396 --> 00:35:56,181
Well, since you’ve fired us, you’ve given us plenty of time to pick it.

562
00:35:56,334 --> 00:35:58,827
And... what do the signs say?

563
00:35:58,944 --> 00:36:01,894
Nothing your entire crab staff doesn’t already know;

564
00:36:01,996 --> 00:36:05,755
that your so-called ‘fresh crabs’ aren’t fresh at all.

565
00:36:05,854 --> 00:36:07,306
They’re frozen.

566
00:36:07,709 --> 00:36:08,689
Now girls!

567
00:36:09,590 --> 00:36:11,156
- That’s a lie. 
- Really?

568
00:36:11,239 --> 00:36:14,091
They’re supposed to be flown in daily; from Alaska.

569
00:36:14,183 --> 00:36:16,988
They come in on a truck… from Jersey.

570
00:36:17,085 --> 00:36:18,871
Listen, you can’t prove any of it!

571
00:36:18,975 --> 00:36:24,551
Oh, really? In the case of ‘Carl’s Famous Crab Bisk’ – you use imitation crab!

572
00:36:24,831 --> 00:36:25,994
Okay...

573
00:36:27,873 --> 00:36:29,332
Negotiate.

574
00:36:29,711 --> 00:36:32,420
A dollar more per hour per crab.

575
00:36:34,834 --> 00:36:36,184
Right, fine!

576
00:36:36,275 --> 00:36:37,883
Two fifteen minute breaks.

577
00:36:37,986 --> 00:36:38,615
One!

578
00:36:38,693 --> 00:36:41,651
Hey, Marls, did I say two… twenty minute breaks?

579
00:36:41,717 --> 00:36:42,470
Yep.

580
00:36:42,768 --> 00:36:45,205
You said fifteen. Alright, two.

581
00:36:45,323 --> 00:36:47,642
Get rid of the signs and you’ve got a deal.

582
00:36:50,693 --> 00:36:52,061
Damn crabs.

583
00:36:58,306 --> 00:36:59,546
Hey, how’d it go?

584
00:37:00,258 --> 00:37:01,230
We won!

585
00:37:03,535 --> 00:37:06,232
So, what’s gonna be your first act as an organised crab?

586
00:37:06,325 --> 00:37:07,578
Actually, I quit.

587
00:37:08,357 --> 00:37:09,127
Seriously?

588
00:37:09,217 --> 00:37:12,264
Yeah. I put in my two weeks notice because by then, I’ll have enough money

589
00:37:12,340 --> 00:37:17,062
to pay my car insurance… and as it turns out, I’m not so big on the working thing.

590
00:37:17,993 --> 00:37:20,789
Felt really good to do something nice for the little guy though.

591
00:37:21,813 --> 00:37:25,594
Well, you must be pretty tired. How bout you get some rest, and I’ll come by later.

592
00:37:25,771 --> 00:37:28,234
How bout you get some rest with me now, boyfriend?

593
00:37:34,295 --> 00:37:36,384
So what d’ya think about your uncle being engaged?

594
00:37:36,466 --> 00:37:38,960
Honestly, I think it’s a little fast.

595
00:37:39,612 --> 00:37:43,491
Ah, well, you know, this HCM thing…

596
00:37:44,136 --> 00:37:46,722
it reminded me that, you know, every day might be the last

597
00:37:46,809 --> 00:37:49,911
and that… I wanna live them all with Jules.

598
00:37:51,019 --> 00:37:54,335
I know, but… I mean, what do you really know about her?

599
00:37:55,553 --> 00:37:57,627
You know, I know that you wanted me to marry your mom.

600
00:37:58,119 --> 00:38:02,531
But… life doesn’t always work according to plan and I had to move on, you know.

601
00:38:02,604 --> 00:38:04,642
I don’t wanna miss a second chance.

602
00:38:05,251 --> 00:38:08,011
And trust me, once you get to know Jules,

603
00:38:08,225 --> 00:38:10,140
you’re gonna love her just as much as I do.

604
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:14,626
You know, I’m glad you’re taking the test, Luke.

605
00:38:14,821 --> 00:38:18,646
Well, like you said; for my mom, right?

606
00:38:19,926 --> 00:38:22,394
Look, before we go in, there’s something I wanna ask ya.

607
00:38:23,059 --> 00:38:25,546
I know this whole thing is still… sinking in…

608
00:38:25,721 --> 00:38:27,380
but it would mean a lot to me

609
00:38:27,696 --> 00:38:29,079
if you’d be my best man.

610
00:38:32,096 --> 00:38:32,977
Sure.

611
00:38:33,763 --> 00:38:34,523
Alright.

612
00:40:29,483 --> 00:40:30,332
Mom?

613
00:40:33,496 --> 00:40:35,376
I don’t agree with your decision.

614
00:40:36,592 --> 00:40:38,218
I don’t understand.

615
00:40:39,748 --> 00:40:41,198
And I’m not going to.

616
00:40:46,922 --> 00:40:48,324
I took the test.

617
00:40:51,981 --> 00:40:53,486
We’ll know in a couple of days.

618
00:40:55,263 --> 00:40:57,070
Thank you. Thank you.

619
00:40:58,942 --> 00:41:00,231
Thank you.

620
00:41:58,086 --> 00:41:59,023
What d’ya want?

621
00:41:59,227 --> 00:42:02,105
You and I are the only ones who know the truth about Jules…

622
00:42:02,288 --> 00:42:03,927
and I’m willing to keep it a secret...

623
00:42:04,081 --> 00:42:05,464
Keith never has to know.

624
00:42:08,147 --> 00:42:09,477
What d’ya want from me?

625
00:42:15,708 --> 00:42:17,445
I’m sure we can work something out.

626
