1
00:00:00,024 --> 00:00:01,761
Previously on "One Tree Hill"...

2
00:00:01,762 --> 00:00:02,620
Marry me.

3
00:00:02,621 --> 00:00:04,552
You can't propose to me.

4
00:00:04,553 --> 00:00:06,202
I was gonna propose to you.

5
00:00:08,609 --> 00:00:11,865
If you tell Whitey I have a heart condition, I'm off the team.

6
00:00:11,866 --> 00:00:15,404
Yeah, and if I don't tell Whitey about your heart condition, you're off the planet.

7
00:00:15,405 --> 00:00:18,440
If you weren't trying to see through her shirt, you would see through her B.S.

8
00:00:18,441 --> 00:00:19,831
She's using you.

9
00:00:19,899 --> 00:00:21,051
Marry me, Haley.

10
00:00:21,056 --> 00:00:24,051
Marry me again in front of all our friends and our family.

11
00:00:24,052 --> 00:00:26,446
Pete from Fall Out Boy, you showed.

12
00:00:26,447 --> 00:00:28,106
Didn't anything think I was gonna show?

13
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:29,762
Sorry. This cabinet's off limits.

14
00:00:29,766 --> 00:00:30,913
What's in there?

15
00:00:30,915 --> 00:00:32,200
It's just private.

16
00:00:32,206 --> 00:00:33,972
I should go sleep on the couch.

17
00:00:33,986 --> 00:00:35,250
Yeah, you should.

18
00:00:35,257 --> 00:00:37,402
But you're not going to.

19
00:00:37,788 --> 00:00:39,681
Brooke Davis, are you threatening me?

20
00:00:39,695 --> 00:00:42,052
Let's just say payback's a bitch.

21
00:01:26,538 --> 00:01:28,291
George Eliot once wrote,

22
00:01:28,676 --> 00:01:31,300
"There is no despair so absolute

23
00:01:31,318 --> 00:01:35,761
as that which comes with the first moments of our first great sorrow,

24
00:01:35,958 --> 00:01:40,630
when we have not yet known what it is to have suffered and be healed,

25
00:01:40,918 --> 00:01:44,453
to have despaired and recovered hope."

26
00:01:52,076 --> 00:01:54,481
Black jerseys for Keith.

27
00:01:56,596 --> 00:01:58,092
First game back.

28
00:01:58,736 --> 00:02:00,092
You ready for this?

29
00:02:00,936 --> 00:02:02,303
I think so.

30
00:02:02,775 --> 00:02:03,970
Yeah.

31
00:02:06,156 --> 00:02:08,232
The whole team's there for you, man.

32
00:02:10,506 --> 00:02:12,402
I got your back out there tonight.

33
00:03:26,927 --> 00:03:28,532
I can't play tonight.

34
00:03:31,085 --> 00:03:32,923
Dustin, you're in.

35
00:03:32,937 --> 00:03:36,011
Coach, we're in this together.

36
00:03:36,396 --> 00:03:37,932
That's what you taught us, right?

37
00:03:46,366 --> 00:03:48,593
I'm afraid that's a forfeit, Ref.

38
00:03:51,395 --> 00:03:55,541
Ladies and gentlemen, it looks like the Ravens are going to forfeit the game.

39
00:04:08,747 --> 00:04:11,691
You guys didn't have to forfeit the game. You didn't have to do that for me.

40
00:04:11,696 --> 00:04:13,190
Hey, I told you --

41
00:04:13,445 --> 00:04:14,862
I got your back.

42
00:04:16,228 --> 00:04:17,411
Thanks.

43
00:04:17,748 --> 00:04:19,932
Here's the thing -- um,

44
00:04:20,496 --> 00:04:24,603
all these guys -- Luke, they'd walk through fire for you.

45
00:04:25,615 --> 00:04:28,643
The question is, are you really gonna make them do that?

46
00:04:29,788 --> 00:04:32,713
Look, remember when I didn't want to play in this crappy, old gym?

47
00:04:32,715 --> 00:04:34,200
Remember what you said to me?

48
00:04:35,008 --> 00:04:36,813
It's not just about us.

49
00:04:36,818 --> 00:04:38,630
Yeah. And you were right.

50
00:04:38,636 --> 00:04:41,630
I mean, these guys deserve a shot at state,

51
00:04:41,647 --> 00:04:44,673
and Whitey -- it's his last year, so...

52
00:04:45,348 --> 00:04:48,781
Look, I'm gonna do everything I can to help you get through this, but

53
00:04:49,007 --> 00:04:51,511
we can't forfeit the season, Luke.

54
00:04:52,665 --> 00:04:53,902
I know.

55
00:05:02,436 --> 00:05:03,802
Rachel, what's wrong?

56
00:05:07,835 --> 00:05:09,320
What? Who is it?

57
00:05:10,526 --> 00:05:12,543
Someone I used to know,

58
00:05:13,608 --> 00:05:15,441
someone who's gone now,

59
00:05:16,337 --> 00:05:18,060
like Jimmy Edwards.

60
00:05:25,746 --> 00:05:27,282
Brooke did this.

61
00:05:40,178 --> 00:05:42,061
What are you doing to Rachel, Brooke?

62
00:05:42,118 --> 00:05:45,041
You know what? After what happened in here tonight with Lucas,

63
00:05:45,045 --> 00:05:47,630
I have more on my mind than your skank-fatuation, Mouth.

64
00:05:47,636 --> 00:05:49,642
It's not fair. She's done nothing to you.

65
00:05:49,647 --> 00:05:50,993
Are you kidding?

66
00:05:50,995 --> 00:05:52,793
How about trying to steal my cheerleading squad

67
00:05:52,796 --> 00:05:55,122
or entering me in Rogue Vogue so she could screw me over

68
00:05:55,125 --> 00:05:58,681
or her midnight round of strip basketball with my boyfriend

69
00:05:58,685 --> 00:06:01,912
or humiliating me in front of all of my friends last weekend?

70
00:06:01,926 --> 00:06:04,042
Stop me anytime, 'cause I can go on and on.

71
00:06:04,057 --> 00:06:07,343
The picture -- Rachel said it was someone she knew.

72
00:06:08,058 --> 00:06:09,910
Yeah, fine.

73
00:06:09,917 --> 00:06:12,380
Maybe you should read the back of it.

74
00:06:15,575 --> 00:06:17,450
The flyers -- where else are they?

75
00:06:17,455 --> 00:06:22,132
Hmm, well, there's a couple at school, a few at Tric,

76
00:06:22,146 --> 00:06:26,152
Karen's Café, numerous convenience stores around town.

77
00:06:26,286 --> 00:06:28,820
- It's my turn to have fun with her.
- Brooke!

78
00:06:30,277 --> 00:06:33,181
Didn't you learn anything from Jimmy's death?

79
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:43,653
You know, now that we're living here,

80
00:06:43,656 --> 00:06:46,920
we should probably try unpacking at some point.

81
00:06:47,728 --> 00:06:50,731
Yeah, well, uh, we've been a little busy...

82
00:06:51,057 --> 00:06:52,520
doing this.

83
00:06:54,505 --> 00:06:57,812
So much better than moving in.

84
00:06:59,415 --> 00:07:01,832
I  can't wait to renew my vows with you.

85
00:07:01,845 --> 00:07:02,981
Me too.

86
00:07:02,987 --> 00:07:05,211
I want that second chance, Haley.

87
00:07:06,006 --> 00:07:08,773
I want to give you that wedding you always dreamed of.

88
00:07:08,775 --> 00:07:10,492
I already had a dream wedding.

89
00:07:10,497 --> 00:07:13,053
No, but you told me how you saw it...

90
00:07:13,938 --> 00:07:16,551
in the church gardens, where your parents got married,

91
00:07:16,557 --> 00:07:20,102
all the bridesmaids and groomsmen, flowers everywhere.

92
00:07:20,716 --> 00:07:22,363
I want that for you.

93
00:07:23,586 --> 00:07:26,983
Okay, I guess unpacking can wait.

94
00:07:29,976 --> 00:07:31,472
What is that?

95
00:07:31,775 --> 00:07:33,531
Do you want me to call 911?

96
00:07:33,537 --> 00:07:34,960
No, no, shh.

97
00:07:34,966 --> 00:07:36,623
Just wait there, okay?

98
00:07:47,957 --> 00:07:49,620
So, how much for the wall?

99
00:07:49,625 --> 00:07:51,902
I'm guessing it's less without the creepy clown?

100
00:07:51,908 --> 00:07:54,613
Uncle Cooper, what are you doing here, man?

101
00:07:54,616 --> 00:07:56,592
It's 1:00 a.m. I'm starving.

102
00:07:56,596 --> 00:07:57,572
Nathan?

103
00:07:57,578 --> 00:07:59,260
Who wants breakfast?

104
00:07:59,456 --> 00:08:00,670
It's okay.

105
00:08:00,817 --> 00:08:02,763
- What's going on?
- Come on.

106
00:08:10,047 --> 00:08:11,520
Hello?

107
00:08:12,078 --> 00:08:13,761
Hi, Pete.

108
00:08:14,607 --> 00:08:18,442
God, you're like the hardest guy on the planet to get ahold of.

109
00:08:19,308 --> 00:08:20,942
But I'm glad you called,

110
00:08:20,956 --> 00:08:25,202
even if it is -- what, 1:00 a.m.?

111
00:08:25,208 --> 00:08:27,590
Nice. Yeah.

112
00:08:28,055 --> 00:08:31,130
So, I didn't freak you out with all my voice mails?

113
00:08:32,675 --> 00:08:35,762
Well, yeah, I miss you, too.

114
00:08:37,548 --> 00:08:40,111
I don't know. I mean, this is crazy, right?

115
00:08:40,117 --> 00:08:43,610
I can't even get you on the phone unless it's the middle of the night.

116
00:08:44,707 --> 00:08:45,863
Okay.

117
00:08:46,387 --> 00:08:49,781
Well, then, why don't you tell me how this is supposed to work?

118
00:08:50,825 --> 00:08:52,671
Right, oh.

119
00:08:52,675 --> 00:08:55,151
Okay, you're outside my window.

120
00:08:57,675 --> 00:08:59,832
You are not outside my window.

121
00:09:05,286 --> 00:09:09,381
Oh, my god. Um, all right, well, just come to the front door.

122
00:09:09,386 --> 00:09:11,020
I'll be down in just a second.

123
00:09:11,025 --> 00:09:12,401
And be quiet.

124
00:09:12,937 --> 00:09:14,050
O kay.

125
00:09:16,747 --> 00:09:18,161
Oh, god.

126
00:09:34,525 --> 00:09:36,750
I  can't believe you sent him away!

127
00:09:36,756 --> 00:09:39,862
A guy shows up at 1:00 a.m. in a limo,

128
00:09:39,868 --> 00:09:42,563
tattooed from head to toe, looking for my daughter?

129
00:09:42,566 --> 00:09:44,962
You're lucky all I did was send him away.

130
00:09:44,977 --> 00:09:46,950
Daddy, that was Pete from Fall Out Boy.

131
00:09:46,957 --> 00:09:50,340
Yeah, well, now he's Pete from Get Out of Town Boy.

132
00:09:50,378 --> 00:09:53,023
I think it's time that we went over the ground rules for this house.

133
00:09:53,025 --> 00:09:54,873
By the way, where is Brooke?

134
00:09:56,056 --> 00:09:56,993
Sleepwalking?

135
00:09:57,005 --> 00:09:58,970
Yeah, nice try. Grab some bed.

136
00:09:59,497 --> 00:10:03,192
Look, you guys, let's get a few things straight here.

137
00:10:03,195 --> 00:10:05,760
No boys in this bedroom ever,

138
00:10:05,778 --> 00:10:09,202
9:00 curfew on weekdays, midnight on weekends.

139
00:10:09,206 --> 00:10:11,283
If you are out after 10:00, I need a phone call

140
00:10:11,285 --> 00:10:12,831
because I need to know where you are.

141
00:10:12,835 --> 00:10:15,671
My cellphone will do very nicely, thank you.

142
00:10:15,675 --> 00:10:18,842
No parties without parental supervision, no alcohol.

143
00:10:18,978 --> 00:10:21,271
Do I need to go over the ground rules for sex?

144
00:10:21,272 --> 00:10:22,586
- No!
- No!

145
00:10:22,747 --> 00:10:24,066
Good, okay.

146
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:28,912
So, now, tell me about Pete from Fall Out Shelter.

147
00:10:28,917 --> 00:10:30,251
Fall Out Boy.

148
00:10:30,415 --> 00:10:34,001
Daddy, lead songwriter of the number-three band on billboard charts.

149
00:10:34,007 --> 00:10:35,461
Grammy-nominated.

150
00:10:35,466 --> 00:10:37,231
Multiplatinum album seller.

151
00:10:37,247 --> 00:10:39,130
And very cute.

152
00:10:39,388 --> 00:10:40,471
Very.

153
00:10:40,477 --> 00:10:44,002
Well, that's all great, but you're telling me about Pete from Fall Out Boy.

154
00:10:44,005 --> 00:10:48,400
What I really want to know about is Pete the boy.

155
00:10:48,756 --> 00:10:50,161
There's a difference.

156
00:10:50,165 --> 00:10:53,113
I mean, where'd he grow up? What kind of family is he from?

157
00:10:53,115 --> 00:10:55,342
Does he hold doors open for you?

158
00:10:55,347 --> 00:10:58,441
Does he say, "God bless you," when you sneeze?

159
00:10:59,146 --> 00:11:03,442
Because, Peyton, I don't care how many albums the guy has sold.

160
00:11:03,447 --> 00:11:06,722
All I care about is how he's going to treat you.

161
00:11:06,726 --> 00:11:11,091
So, let's just agree that when Pete visits this house,

162
00:11:11,096 --> 00:11:13,441
it will be strictly between business hours.

163
00:11:13,445 --> 00:11:14,801
Got it?

164
00:11:15,657 --> 00:11:17,710
Good, and while we're at it --

165
00:11:17,717 --> 00:11:20,961
Brooke, now that you are living here,

166
00:11:20,977 --> 00:11:27,841
let's just assume that you're going to find a new hot-dad fantasy, all right?

167
00:11:27,846 --> 00:11:30,483
Thank you very much. Good night, ladies.

168
00:11:30,485 --> 00:11:31,653
Good night.

169
00:11:31,928 --> 00:11:34,931
Oh, my god. Oh, my god.

170
00:11:41,596 --> 00:11:43,380
So, it's Haley, right?

171
00:11:43,597 --> 00:11:47,322
I always wanted to meet the girl who made my nephew crash a perfectly good racecar.

172
00:11:47,326 --> 00:11:50,562
I always wanted to meet the uncle who let Nathan crash a racecar.

173
00:11:50,916 --> 00:11:52,962
She's tough, Nate. I like her.

174
00:11:52,988 --> 00:11:54,762
You know, your mom's back in town.

175
00:11:54,778 --> 00:11:56,520
Yeah, she called, actually.

176
00:11:56,525 --> 00:11:59,862
Unlike you, she had the decency not to storm our apartment at 1:00 in the morning.

177
00:11:59,877 --> 00:12:02,012
Hey, give me a break. I was hungry, all right?

178
00:12:02,016 --> 00:12:04,700
Oh, by the way, I met this smoking-hot girl.

179
00:12:04,708 --> 00:12:08,293
She's 26. She's a model -- you know, my type.

180
00:12:08,298 --> 00:12:10,912
She's home from New York. She's house-sitting for her parents.

181
00:12:10,915 --> 00:12:13,552
I'm telling you -- god loves me.

182
00:12:14,366 --> 00:12:15,871
Are you staying for a while?

183
00:12:15,877 --> 00:12:17,212
Absolutely.

184
00:12:17,446 --> 00:12:20,302
If you saw this girl, Nate, you'd know why, too.

185
00:12:20,437 --> 00:12:21,652
Sorry.

186
00:12:22,396 --> 00:12:23,921
This does look really good.

187
00:12:23,926 --> 00:12:26,242
Well, it helps if you're a little buzzed.

188
00:12:28,686 --> 00:12:32,762
So, Nate, listen -- I'm sorry about Keith.

189
00:12:33,046 --> 00:12:34,763
How's Lucas taking it?

190
00:12:34,778 --> 00:12:36,012
Not good.

191
00:12:36,018 --> 00:12:39,273
He walked off the court tonight. We had to forfeit the game.

192
00:12:41,665 --> 00:12:44,720
Well, you know what? He'll -- he'll be okay.

193
00:12:45,547 --> 00:12:47,382
Eat up. It's gonna get cold.

194
00:13:09,528 --> 00:13:10,810
Karen?

195
00:13:13,647 --> 00:13:14,851
Hi.

196
00:13:19,017 --> 00:13:22,362
I'm so sorry I didn't make it back for Keith's funeral.

197
00:13:22,728 --> 00:13:24,532
I came as soon as I could.

198
00:13:28,525 --> 00:13:30,310
How are you holding up?

199
00:13:33,368 --> 00:13:35,922
The important thing is to get you back on your feet.

200
00:13:36,438 --> 00:13:40,363
I'm just here to tell you that I want to help you any way I can.

201
00:13:40,376 --> 00:13:42,011
You've done enough, Deb.

202
00:13:42,937 --> 00:13:44,182
What do you mean?

203
00:13:44,197 --> 00:13:46,670
Keith told me that you tried to kill Dan.

204
00:13:49,257 --> 00:13:51,961
It was a terrible mistake.

205
00:13:52,028 --> 00:13:54,571
Not a day goes by that I don't regret it, Karen.

206
00:13:54,575 --> 00:13:58,132
My son ran into a burning building to fix your mistake.

207
00:13:58,426 --> 00:14:00,982
I could have lost him the way I lost Keith.

208
00:14:00,988 --> 00:14:04,981
I'm so sorry that happened. I had no idea that he was there.

209
00:14:05,526 --> 00:14:07,283
Thank God Lucas is okay.

210
00:14:07,285 --> 00:14:09,181
He's not okay, Deb!

211
00:14:09,188 --> 00:14:11,150
None of us are okay.

212
00:14:11,637 --> 00:14:17,283
And as far as I'm concerned, the only difference between you and Jimmy Edwards...

213
00:14:18,256 --> 00:14:21,312
is that he was successful.

214
00:14:31,325 --> 00:14:32,502
Rachel?

215
00:14:32,507 --> 00:14:35,023
Um, speak softly, Mouth.

216
00:14:35,028 --> 00:14:37,012
I'm a little hung over.

217
00:14:38,627 --> 00:14:40,752
I believe this belongs to you.

218
00:14:42,978 --> 00:14:44,102
It's you.

219
00:14:44,106 --> 00:14:47,182
That girl is gone. She used to be you.

220
00:14:47,235 --> 00:14:53,743
No, I used to be her, but I hated myself, so I had some surgery.

221
00:14:54,237 --> 00:14:55,680
Like what?

222
00:14:56,117 --> 00:14:59,523
I had my stomach stapled and starved myself for months

223
00:14:59,525 --> 00:15:02,360
and then rewarded myself with a nose job, fake breasts,

224
00:15:02,366 --> 00:15:03,810
and a couple other things.

225
00:15:03,817 --> 00:15:05,111
So what?

226
00:15:05,128 --> 00:15:07,070
I just -- I can't believe it.

227
00:15:07,077 --> 00:15:07,943
Why?

228
00:15:07,948 --> 00:15:10,531
If I was born like this, no one would have a problem with it.

229
00:15:10,537 --> 00:15:12,730
And I work hard to take care of the new me.

230
00:15:12,737 --> 00:15:14,243
I like the new me.

231
00:15:15,057 --> 00:15:16,723
Do you, Rachel?

232
00:15:17,548 --> 00:15:22,301
'Cause other than me, I don't see you letting too many people into your life.

233
00:15:22,417 --> 00:15:24,381
Don't judge me, Mouth.

234
00:15:24,735 --> 00:15:26,353
You didn't know the old me.

235
00:15:26,355 --> 00:15:29,401
I have self-esteem now that I've never had before.

236
00:15:29,407 --> 00:15:31,222
And that's great, but

237
00:15:31,226 --> 00:15:34,331
isn't it more about what kind of person you are --

238
00:15:34,337 --> 00:15:36,372
you know, what's on the inside?

239
00:15:36,608 --> 00:15:39,242
As far as I can tell, that's a bunch of crap.

240
00:15:42,317 --> 00:15:44,270
Come on, tell me something, Mouth.

241
00:15:44,278 --> 00:15:48,432
If you could snap your fingers and look like Lucas, would you?

242
00:15:48,436 --> 00:15:49,821
I mean, sure, you would.

243
00:15:49,828 --> 00:15:52,101
And don't say you wouldn't, because you'd be lying.

244
00:15:53,418 --> 00:15:56,772
I think if I could snap my fingers and get something,

245
00:15:57,427 --> 00:15:59,750
it wouldn't be about how I look.

246
00:16:00,525 --> 00:16:02,220
But let's say you're right.

247
00:16:02,226 --> 00:16:05,291
Should everyone who doesn't like the way they look have surgery?

248
00:16:05,305 --> 00:16:06,982
No, of course not.

249
00:16:06,986 --> 00:16:09,831
But I mean, if they do, and it makes them feel good about themselves,

250
00:16:09,837 --> 00:16:11,671
are you gonna hold that against them?

251
00:16:12,226 --> 00:16:16,300
Look, Mouth, the choices I made were extreme.

252
00:16:16,305 --> 00:16:18,980
The surgeries were expensive and painful.

253
00:16:19,345 --> 00:16:21,493
They came with serious risks.

254
00:16:22,296 --> 00:16:25,062
But now Brooke's gonna out me, and everyone's gonna look at me

255
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:26,971
like I'm some kind of Frankenstein.

256
00:16:26,976 --> 00:16:29,602
You don't know that. I don't feel that way.

257
00:16:29,987 --> 00:16:31,210
Really?

258
00:16:33,088 --> 00:16:36,552
I can look at your face and tell that you already see me differently.

259
00:16:45,477 --> 00:16:47,360
This is who I am now.

260
00:16:50,667 --> 00:16:52,090
This girl's dead.

261
00:17:01,806 --> 00:17:04,003
I thought this game was more exciting.

262
00:17:05,538 --> 00:17:08,050
Coop, I heard you were in town.

263
00:17:08,058 --> 00:17:09,323
How you doing?

264
00:17:09,987 --> 00:17:11,532
I knew I'd find you here.

265
00:17:12,536 --> 00:17:16,622
Whenever I do my big thinking, I mostly find myself in an empty racetrack.

266
00:17:16,707 --> 00:17:19,462
I think the silence clears my head.

267
00:17:19,586 --> 00:17:20,813
Me too.

268
00:17:22,335 --> 00:17:24,410
So, when's the circus start back up, huh?

269
00:17:24,418 --> 00:17:27,012
For the drivers, three weeks.

270
00:17:27,018 --> 00:17:28,550
For me, it doesn't.

271
00:17:29,228 --> 00:17:30,682
I blew my ride.

272
00:17:30,758 --> 00:17:32,002
What happened?

273
00:17:32,007 --> 00:17:35,972
Well, for one thing, I let my nephew crash a racecar into the wall,

274
00:17:35,976 --> 00:17:38,140
and then things got a little dark from there.

275
00:17:38,148 --> 00:17:39,081
Sorry.

276
00:17:39,087 --> 00:17:40,442
Y eah.

277
00:17:40,598 --> 00:17:42,723
You know, when they told me I couldn't drive,

278
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:44,311
I thought my life was over.

279
00:17:44,318 --> 00:17:48,351
Racing was all that I had, you know? It was who I was.

280
00:17:48,508 --> 00:17:51,042
Then the next day, the sun came up, the world kept turning,

281
00:17:51,045 --> 00:17:53,581
and I was gonna be okay, you know?

282
00:17:53,787 --> 00:17:58,700
It took me awhile, but I finally realized that even if I never get to race again,

283
00:17:58,755 --> 00:18:00,892
I know I can be happy.

284
00:18:02,876 --> 00:18:05,452
Nathan told me about the game, man.

285
00:18:05,865 --> 00:18:07,312
I'll get it back.

286
00:18:07,315 --> 00:18:08,692
I hope you do.

287
00:18:08,695 --> 00:18:10,730
But if for some reason you don't,

288
00:18:10,788 --> 00:18:12,460
it'll be okay.

289
00:18:15,026 --> 00:18:18,363
It's not what you do in life that matters, Luke.

290
00:18:19,557 --> 00:18:21,552
It's about who you are.

291
00:18:27,146 --> 00:18:28,912
I'm so glad you're happy.

292
00:18:28,916 --> 00:18:31,601
I am happy. It is everything that I dreamed it would be.

293
00:18:31,606 --> 00:18:35,380
I'm just so happy to be renewing my vows with you.

294
00:18:38,557 --> 00:18:41,673
Thank you for this. It's so beautiful.

295
00:18:41,678 --> 00:18:42,890
There is one catch.

296
00:18:42,905 --> 00:18:44,030
What?

297
00:18:44,038 --> 00:18:48,433
Well, the church will only allow us to have the wedding on their grounds

298
00:18:48,437 --> 00:18:51,622
if  we agree to take their premarital counseling class,

299
00:18:51,625 --> 00:18:54,370
even though technically we're postmarital.

300
00:18:54,377 --> 00:18:56,133
Okay, what is that?

301
00:18:56,557 --> 00:18:58,363
We have to take a test

302
00:18:58,555 --> 00:19:00,561
to  see if we're compatible...

303
00:19:00,568 --> 00:19:04,052
and then, I guess, get some tips on how to not pull each other's hair out.

304
00:19:04,058 --> 00:19:05,150
It sounds like the basics.

305
00:19:05,157 --> 00:19:09,390
Okay. Well, how hard can one test be? I am tutor girl, after all.

306
00:19:09,498 --> 00:19:12,963
Besides, I'll do anything I have to to marry you again.

307
00:19:21,015 --> 00:19:24,161
Hey, Pete, I was hoping you'd call.

308
00:19:24,277 --> 00:19:27,962
Actually, it's not. It's Bill, the tour manager. Is this Peyton?

309
00:19:28,335 --> 00:19:29,240
Yeah.

310
00:19:29,246 --> 00:19:31,611
Hey, Peyton. Sorry. I'm using Pete's phone.

311
00:19:31,618 --> 00:19:33,020
I think we met at Tric.

312
00:19:33,025 --> 00:19:35,112
Oh, right, yeah. Hi.

313
00:19:35,118 --> 00:19:39,180
Hey. Well, listen, Pete wanted to call you himself, but the band's really crazed.

314
00:19:39,187 --> 00:19:42,501
But he really wants to see you, so he's going to leave you a plane ticket at the airport.

315
00:19:42,508 --> 00:19:44,342
A -- a plane ticket?

316
00:19:44,346 --> 00:19:46,301
To Chicago, this weekend.

317
00:19:47,006 --> 00:19:50,662
Wow, I mean, that's -- that's really, really nice.

318
00:19:50,665 --> 00:19:54,531
Thank you, but my dad -- I mean, he'll freak out

319
00:19:54,538 --> 00:19:56,691
if I tell him I'm flying to Chicago.

320
00:19:56,938 --> 00:19:58,792
Yeah, Pete said you'd say that.

321
00:19:58,808 --> 00:20:00,722
But he said to tell you that you'd really be doing him a favor.

322
00:20:00,725 --> 00:20:03,791
Because the band thinks you're a Snuffleupagus.

323
00:20:04,148 --> 00:20:06,451
Anyway, if you need anything else, just call me directly.

324
00:20:06,457 --> 00:20:09,213
Otherwise, we'll have a car waiting at the airport.

325
00:20:10,598 --> 00:20:14,272
Okay, thank you. And can you just tell Pete that I said...

326
00:20:17,745 --> 00:20:19,280
...that I miss him.

327
00:20:23,175 --> 00:20:27,303
You gonna let an old man stand out here in the cold, or are you gonna ask me in?

328
00:20:27,926 --> 00:20:29,262
Suit yourself.

329
00:20:34,215 --> 00:20:36,501
Karen, I know what you're going through.

330
00:20:36,505 --> 00:20:38,532
I lost the love of my life, too.

331
00:20:38,537 --> 00:20:41,863
You had Camilla for a lifetime. I had Keith for a few weeks.

332
00:20:41,867 --> 00:20:43,623
Whose fault was that?

333
00:20:50,107 --> 00:20:54,852
Whew! Well, I'm glad to see you're still in there.

334
00:20:55,625 --> 00:20:57,422
Now, you listen to me.

335
00:20:57,447 --> 00:21:01,500
I said that because I know the guilt that you're carrying around,

336
00:21:01,517 --> 00:21:03,121
and you're wrong to feel it.

337
00:21:03,127 --> 00:21:05,773
Feeling guilty is not going to bring Keith back.

338
00:21:05,775 --> 00:21:09,063
Don't I have a right to feel bad?

339
00:21:09,246 --> 00:21:13,290
Did you know Lucas was so broken-up he couldn't play the last game?

340
00:21:14,947 --> 00:21:17,003
No, I didn't think so.

341
00:21:17,865 --> 00:21:19,471
Look, Karen...

342
00:21:20,155 --> 00:21:25,091
you gave Keith the thing that he loved most in all the world --

343
00:21:25,156 --> 00:21:26,822
Lucas.

344
00:21:27,188 --> 00:21:31,792
He was never happier than when he was talking about you and that boy.

345
00:21:32,365 --> 00:21:35,643
You gave him a son for a lifetime,

346
00:21:35,645 --> 00:21:38,230
and you let him matter to Lucas.

347
00:21:38,236 --> 00:21:40,510
I know how that feels.

348
00:21:40,515 --> 00:21:44,011
Karen, you couldn't have given him much more.

349
00:21:45,226 --> 00:21:48,583
Let the guilt fall away.

350
00:21:49,758 --> 00:21:51,441
Let it go.

351
00:22:10,566 --> 00:22:14,473
This test will determine whether you're really suited for each other.

352
00:22:17,295 --> 00:22:20,552
I know you're both married. This is just a requirement, okay?

353
00:22:23,335 --> 00:22:25,463
Come on. It'll be fun.

354
00:22:36,986 --> 00:22:38,530
That's the last of them.

355
00:22:39,948 --> 00:22:41,240
Thanks.

356
00:22:41,717 --> 00:22:45,550
When we were together during the blackout, I loved talking to you.

357
00:22:45,557 --> 00:22:47,433
And it didn't matter that I couldn't see you

358
00:22:47,436 --> 00:22:50,202
because that night it wasn't about your looks.

359
00:22:50,206 --> 00:22:52,800
It was about your heart, your sense of humor,

360
00:22:52,806 --> 00:22:55,183
the way you saw the world.

361
00:22:55,307 --> 00:22:57,302
I felt like I really knew you.

362
00:22:57,868 --> 00:23:00,620
I actually hated it when those lights came back on.

363
00:23:01,855 --> 00:23:04,230
Now these flyers change everything, right?

364
00:23:04,236 --> 00:23:06,063
I mean, now you don't really know me.

365
00:23:06,065 --> 00:23:08,171
No, now I'm sure I know you.

366
00:23:08,355 --> 00:23:12,521
'Cause when I saw those flyers, I realized we were more alike than I knew.

367
00:23:12,935 --> 00:23:18,320
And for a moment, it was like being back there in the dark again, just the two of us.

368
00:23:19,508 --> 00:23:22,432
I don't see anything ugly in that picture, Rachel.

369
00:23:24,226 --> 00:23:25,551
Thank you.

370
00:23:26,157 --> 00:23:30,020
But trust me -- a lot of people did,

371
00:23:30,268 --> 00:23:32,000
especially me.

372
00:23:32,786 --> 00:23:37,041
Well, I guess I just want to know if you ever really let go of that,

373
00:23:37,048 --> 00:23:38,840
the person you used to be.

374
00:23:38,846 --> 00:23:43,700
I mean, when you walk down these halls, do you still feel self-conscious?

375
00:23:43,706 --> 00:23:47,373
Do you hope to be accepted? Do you worry about fitting in?

376
00:23:47,375 --> 00:23:50,741
'Cause I figure the old you probably worried about those things.

377
00:23:51,065 --> 00:23:54,060
Yes, Mouth, I still feel that way.

378
00:23:54,067 --> 00:23:56,593
There's not a surgery to fix that yet.

379
00:23:59,785 --> 00:24:02,532
You know, you're really beautiful now, Rachel.

380
00:24:03,048 --> 00:24:05,192
But I just want you to know...

381
00:24:06,067 --> 00:24:09,002
I could have loved the girl in that picture.

382
00:24:11,508 --> 00:24:13,642
I wish she could have met you.

383
00:24:38,885 --> 00:24:39,991
Coach.

384
00:24:43,836 --> 00:24:46,291
Basketball has always been...

385
00:24:47,417 --> 00:24:49,243
a huge part of who I am,

386
00:24:49,935 --> 00:24:52,030
and I've been thinking a lot about it.

387
00:24:53,305 --> 00:24:58,670
But unless somebody can tell me why this game matters right now...

388
00:25:01,436 --> 00:25:03,291
...I don't think I can play.

389
00:25:13,165 --> 00:25:15,692
You know, every time we take this court,

390
00:25:15,697 --> 00:25:20,282
we come in under that old, faded banner up there.

391
00:25:20,605 --> 00:25:23,131
It says, "Home of the Monarchs."

392
00:25:23,436 --> 00:25:25,812
Anybody know who the Monarchs were?

393
00:25:25,817 --> 00:25:30,120
The Monarchs were the best basketball team in the state back in the '50s.

394
00:25:30,127 --> 00:25:32,443
Yeah, some people say they were.

395
00:25:32,447 --> 00:25:34,802
They were never in the record books

396
00:25:34,806 --> 00:25:39,891
because the Monarchs were an all-black team.

397
00:25:40,646 --> 00:25:45,402
Back in those days, when I was your age...

398
00:25:46,148 --> 00:25:50,162
blacks and whites weren't allowed to play this game together.

399
00:25:51,008 --> 00:25:55,271
I was on the best team in the state,

400
00:25:55,436 --> 00:25:58,121
but we all knew there was another one --

401
00:25:58,127 --> 00:25:59,832
the Monarchs.

402
00:26:00,167 --> 00:26:06,870
One night, both teams snuck in here, locked the door, and squared off.

403
00:26:07,435 --> 00:26:08,830
They were good.

404
00:26:08,836 --> 00:26:11,311
Oh, they were damn good.

405
00:26:11,857 --> 00:26:14,153
We played four games.

406
00:26:14,155 --> 00:26:17,441
They got their shots. We got ours.

407
00:26:18,048 --> 00:26:23,282
And then something magical happened...

408
00:26:23,677 --> 00:26:27,521
something that none of us could have anticipated,

409
00:26:27,546 --> 00:26:31,940
something that had never happened in this state before.

410
00:26:33,176 --> 00:26:37,133
We decided to mix the teams.

411
00:26:38,025 --> 00:26:42,581
Their captain and our captain started picking players.

412
00:26:42,685 --> 00:26:47,032
As it turned out, I was next to the last one picked.

413
00:26:47,467 --> 00:26:50,292
Their captain looked me in the eye

414
00:26:51,078 --> 00:26:54,922
and said, "I'll take Whitey,"

415
00:26:55,558 --> 00:26:57,211
and it stuck.

416
00:26:57,416 --> 00:27:00,852
That's how I got my nickname.

417
00:27:03,276 --> 00:27:06,872
Well, that night changed all our lives.

418
00:27:07,058 --> 00:27:11,892
We were no longer black players or white players.

419
00:27:11,898 --> 00:27:14,730
We were just players,

420
00:27:15,015 --> 00:27:20,840
and we shut out the world and played together.

421
00:27:20,846 --> 00:27:26,260
We played a game that we loved, and that night, that game changed everything.

422
00:27:26,265 --> 00:27:28,751
I haven't been the same since.

423
00:27:31,586 --> 00:27:35,771
You want me to tell you that this game matters?

424
00:27:39,707 --> 00:27:41,793
I promise you, son --

425
00:27:42,127 --> 00:27:44,003
it does matter.

426
00:27:44,585 --> 00:27:47,202
Let the game heal you, Lucas.

427
00:27:48,448 --> 00:27:50,781
Come back to us, son.

428
00:27:59,166 --> 00:28:00,840
Brooke, are you awake?

429
00:28:01,677 --> 00:28:05,802
Honey, how could I possibly be sleeping with you thinking so loudly?

430
00:28:10,257 --> 00:28:12,270
What's the matter, Peyton?

431
00:28:12,327 --> 00:28:13,772
Pete.

432
00:28:13,796 --> 00:28:17,331
He wants me to fly to Chicago tomorrow night. He left me a ticket.

433
00:28:17,338 --> 00:28:19,511
Um, then why are we still talking about this?

434
00:28:19,518 --> 00:28:22,000
If you don't get on that plane, we are no longer friends.

435
00:28:22,008 --> 00:28:24,461
Brooke, I can't do this again.

436
00:28:24,465 --> 00:28:27,943
Why is it that every guy that I like always has to leave?

437
00:28:27,947 --> 00:28:29,151
It's not fair.

438
00:28:29,167 --> 00:28:31,960
Then you have no choice. You have to go.

439
00:28:31,967 --> 00:28:33,153
Why?

440
00:28:33,156 --> 00:28:36,971
Hmm, let's see. Because he's cute, and he's a rock star.

441
00:28:36,977 --> 00:28:39,662
And you love music. And he's nice to you.

442
00:28:39,665 --> 00:28:42,702
And if you go, you'll have a great time, and maybe you'll fall in love.

443
00:28:42,708 --> 00:28:47,593
And if you don't, you're gonna look back on this in 20 years and wonder, "what if?"

444
00:28:47,757 --> 00:28:49,761
I already have my what-ifs.

445
00:28:49,937 --> 00:28:53,170
Well, maybe this time you can have something more.

446
00:29:04,937 --> 00:29:09,692
I'm sorry. I don't quite know how to tell you this, but you failed.

447
00:29:10,376 --> 00:29:11,451
You're kidding.

448
00:29:11,456 --> 00:29:15,422
I'm sorry, no. According to the test, you two of you are highly incompatible.

449
00:29:17,045 --> 00:29:20,441
I've never actually failed a test before.

450
00:29:22,576 --> 00:29:24,912
Father, can I ask you a question?

451
00:29:25,736 --> 00:29:27,713
When you decided you wanted to be a priest,

452
00:29:27,717 --> 00:29:30,010
how did you know it was the right thing to do?

453
00:29:30,698 --> 00:29:33,051
I had a devout belief in God.

454
00:29:33,097 --> 00:29:35,153
Can you prove that to us?

455
00:29:35,176 --> 00:29:37,603
With some sort of a test, I mean.

456
00:29:38,336 --> 00:29:39,823
Of course not.

457
00:29:40,015 --> 00:29:43,000
Just like you can't prove love with a test.

458
00:29:43,006 --> 00:29:45,880
I mean, this is just a score on a sheet of paper.

459
00:29:46,105 --> 00:29:48,002
Sure, Haley and I have our differences,

460
00:29:48,005 --> 00:29:52,710
but this test doesn't show how hard we've worked to keep this relationship together

461
00:29:52,717 --> 00:29:56,612
or that I can't stand it when we're apart

462
00:29:57,298 --> 00:30:00,032
or that every time I look at her

463
00:30:00,265 --> 00:30:03,733
I know that I'm gonna be with her for the rest of my life.

464
00:30:06,146 --> 00:30:08,500
We love each other, Father.

465
00:30:08,645 --> 00:30:10,793
No test is gonna show that.

466
00:30:14,328 --> 00:30:15,652
Let me see that test.

467
00:30:20,575 --> 00:30:23,703
Thanks for passing the real test.

468
00:30:23,807 --> 00:30:25,570
I'm sure you'll have a wonderful ceremony.

469
00:30:25,578 --> 00:30:26,751
Thank you.

470
00:30:26,758 --> 00:30:28,361
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

471
00:30:33,775 --> 00:30:35,171
Hey, Lucas.

472
00:30:35,175 --> 00:30:36,301
Hey.

473
00:30:36,757 --> 00:30:39,281
Aw, Deb, it's so good to see you.

474
00:30:40,195 --> 00:30:43,202
Are you sure you can handle all this?

475
00:30:43,235 --> 00:30:44,731
Karen's my partner.

476
00:30:44,737 --> 00:30:47,640
God knows she's picked up the slack for me a time or two.

477
00:30:47,647 --> 00:30:49,182
It's the least I could do.

478
00:30:49,185 --> 00:30:54,383
Oh, but to be honest, it'll be a full-blown miracle if the register balances.

479
00:30:56,956 --> 00:30:59,190
Thanks for helping my mom out.

480
00:31:00,277 --> 00:31:01,871
It means a lot.

481
00:31:04,165 --> 00:31:06,410
So, how is it being back...

482
00:31:06,476 --> 00:31:09,012
with Dan and all?

483
00:31:09,307 --> 00:31:11,032
Well, Cooper is staying with me.

484
00:31:11,036 --> 00:31:12,962
It feels safe to have family around,

485
00:31:12,967 --> 00:31:16,482
and so far Dan is keeping his distance, so

486
00:31:16,917 --> 00:31:18,461
I'll be okay.

487
00:31:21,678 --> 00:31:26,223
You know, when Nathan wrecked that car,

488
00:31:26,226 --> 00:31:28,592
I didn't speak to Cooper for months.

489
00:31:28,595 --> 00:31:32,162
I mean, I knew it wasn't really his fault, but

490
00:31:32,168 --> 00:31:34,471
somehow I blamed anyway.

491
00:31:37,098 --> 00:31:40,853
Losing your child is every mother's biggest fear.

492
00:31:40,856 --> 00:31:43,631
Nothing even comes close.

493
00:31:44,625 --> 00:31:48,323
For your mom to get better, she's really gonna have to lean on you, Lucas.

494
00:31:48,326 --> 00:31:52,612
So, whatever you do, just make sure to take care of yourself.

495
00:31:53,175 --> 00:31:55,161
You have to...

496
00:31:55,346 --> 00:31:57,243
for your mother's sake.

497
00:32:05,487 --> 00:32:09,370
You're gonna be set up here. You're gonna have to start out pressing these guys hard.

498
00:32:09,378 --> 00:32:11,592
Steven and Daniel surround the opposite there.

499
00:32:11,756 --> 00:32:13,452
Coach, you got a second?

500
00:32:13,668 --> 00:32:15,512
Oh, yeah, sit down.

501
00:32:16,366 --> 00:32:18,262
You need to hear this, too, Nate.

502
00:32:23,997 --> 00:32:25,762
I can't play tonight.

503
00:32:28,697 --> 00:32:30,552
I have a heart condition.

504
00:32:33,746 --> 00:32:36,353
I have HCM, and I haven't been taking my medication

505
00:32:36,358 --> 00:32:38,612
so that I wouldn't slow down my game.

506
00:32:39,667 --> 00:32:41,453
And if I play...

507
00:32:42,626 --> 00:32:44,182
...I could die.

508
00:32:48,385 --> 00:32:50,653
I know how selfish I've been.

509
00:32:51,238 --> 00:32:54,112
I just didn't want to leave the game behind.

510
00:32:55,297 --> 00:32:59,043
Because the game did change my life...

511
00:32:59,796 --> 00:33:01,842
just like yours.

512
00:33:02,625 --> 00:33:04,492
And it's...

513
00:33:05,687 --> 00:33:08,312
...gonna be hard to let it go.

514
00:33:12,555 --> 00:33:16,412
The game can only change you if you have a life to change, right?

515
00:33:16,677 --> 00:33:20,553
I know how hard this conversation must be for you, Lucas.

516
00:33:20,568 --> 00:33:21,830
No.

517
00:33:23,238 --> 00:33:26,210
The next conversation I have is gonna be the hard one.

518
00:34:51,588 --> 00:34:52,933
Nice picture.

519
00:34:53,248 --> 00:34:56,580
When are you gonna get over Jabba the slut so we can go back to being friends?

520
00:34:56,585 --> 00:34:59,040
You know, Brooke, you got Rachel all wrong.

521
00:34:59,045 --> 00:35:03,410
She's not a bad person, and what you're doing to her is cruel.

522
00:35:03,416 --> 00:35:05,162
But I'm not.

523
00:35:05,168 --> 00:35:08,103
You know me, Mouth, and as scrumptious as it sounds,

524
00:35:08,108 --> 00:35:11,252
I could never go through with operation fat Rachel.

525
00:35:11,258 --> 00:35:12,860
I'm just playing around.

526
00:35:12,867 --> 00:35:14,222
Well, that's good, Brooke.

527
00:35:14,228 --> 00:35:16,740
You better get used to Rachel being around.

528
00:35:16,756 --> 00:35:20,431
She's a great person, and deep down she has a big heart.

529
00:35:21,146 --> 00:35:22,942
I like her...

530
00:35:23,006 --> 00:35:24,422
a lot.

531
00:35:25,048 --> 00:35:27,591
Look, I know she says she's into you.

532
00:35:27,628 --> 00:35:30,150
Just please be careful.

533
00:35:30,365 --> 00:35:33,312
You know a leopard doesn't change its spots.

534
00:35:33,545 --> 00:35:36,282
Actually, she did change her spots.

535
00:35:36,298 --> 00:35:38,773
I just hope her heart's the same.

536
00:35:49,087 --> 00:35:50,303
Hey.

537
00:35:51,228 --> 00:35:54,872
I hope I didn't completely freak out Fall Out Boy.

538
00:35:55,545 --> 00:35:57,091
Have you heard from him?

539
00:35:58,166 --> 00:35:59,432
Maybe.

540
00:35:59,435 --> 00:36:01,513
Oh, a woman of mystery.

541
00:36:03,136 --> 00:36:06,101
Must have gotten that from your mother. You didn't get it from me.

542
00:36:09,985 --> 00:36:12,011
You know I trust you, right?

543
00:36:12,458 --> 00:36:13,781
Yeah.

544
00:36:14,006 --> 00:36:15,323
Good.

545
00:36:20,436 --> 00:36:22,393
Just promise me one thing.

546
00:36:22,876 --> 00:36:27,551
Promise me that when you pick the boy you're really gonna be with

547
00:36:27,555 --> 00:36:30,562
that he'll be someone who respects you

548
00:36:30,768 --> 00:36:32,752
and treats you well...

549
00:36:33,838 --> 00:36:37,820
and that he's someone who makes your heart race

550
00:36:37,928 --> 00:36:40,592
and that he's someone who you love

551
00:36:40,598 --> 00:36:44,713
because of what he is, not what he does.

552
00:36:50,216 --> 00:36:53,461
Because that's how I felt about your mother,

553
00:36:53,737 --> 00:36:57,581
and that's how I want you to feel one day.

554
00:37:00,805 --> 00:37:02,793
Use your head...

555
00:37:04,027 --> 00:37:05,993
and follow your heart.

556
00:37:32,777 --> 00:37:36,222
46 points? That's like really good, isn't it?

557
00:37:36,227 --> 00:37:37,683
It's not bad.

558
00:37:37,977 --> 00:37:39,862
Well, you were amazing.

559
00:37:39,865 --> 00:37:40,980
Thank you.

560
00:37:40,985 --> 00:37:42,542
Where was Luke tonight?

561
00:37:44,626 --> 00:37:47,630
Lucas has a heart condition, Hales.

562
00:37:48,797 --> 00:37:52,913
Um, don't be mad at me. I kind of already knew about his HCM.

563
00:37:52,918 --> 00:37:54,962
He made me promise not to tell anybody.

564
00:37:54,968 --> 00:37:56,480
Sorry.

565
00:37:56,497 --> 00:37:58,522
Isn't he taking his medication?

566
00:37:58,557 --> 00:37:59,591
No.

567
00:37:59,595 --> 00:38:01,110
Great. So he lied to me.

568
00:38:01,116 --> 00:38:04,720
Well, I think he lied to everyone, including himself.

569
00:38:04,978 --> 00:38:06,423
Is he gonna be okay?

570
00:38:06,428 --> 00:38:07,733
Yeah.

571
00:38:07,738 --> 00:38:10,613
We're all gonna make sure he's okay, promise.

572
00:38:12,206 --> 00:38:14,613
Thank you for being such an amazing guy.

573
00:38:14,847 --> 00:38:17,610
And thank you for having the right answer with that priest the other day.

574
00:38:17,625 --> 00:38:20,790
God, I thought we weren't going to get our big wedding.

575
00:38:21,545 --> 00:38:24,110
You know, we don't still have to do that if you don't want to.

576
00:38:24,116 --> 00:38:25,571
No, I really want to.

577
00:38:25,577 --> 00:38:29,633
I've just been trying to think of a way to make the day really memorable,

578
00:38:29,648 --> 00:38:32,342
and I had an idea.

579
00:38:32,347 --> 00:38:33,593
You ready?

580
00:38:33,598 --> 00:38:35,240
- Yeah.
- Okay.

581
00:38:35,937 --> 00:38:39,541
What if we don't have sex until we get married again?

582
00:38:41,818 --> 00:38:43,713
Do you still love me?

583
00:38:43,716 --> 00:38:45,432
What, are you kidding?

584
00:38:47,816 --> 00:38:49,341
Uh...

585
00:38:50,566 --> 00:38:52,230
yeah, okay.

586
00:38:52,236 --> 00:38:56,751
But does that mean that I can't still kiss you like this?

587
00:38:57,267 --> 00:38:58,523
No.

588
00:38:58,786 --> 00:39:01,010
Or like this?

589
00:39:01,568 --> 00:39:04,451
Okay, maybe we'll just start on the no-sex thing tomorrow night.

590
00:39:04,457 --> 00:39:06,140
You know, that's fine.

591
00:39:14,505 --> 00:39:15,630
Mom?

592
00:39:17,516 --> 00:39:22,252
I know that you're hurting now more than ever,

593
00:39:23,178 --> 00:39:25,860
and I don't want to make that worse.

594
00:39:26,715 --> 00:39:29,130
But I need to tell you something.

595
00:39:40,015 --> 00:39:43,352
I lied to you about my heart condition.

596
00:39:46,986 --> 00:39:48,743
I have HCM.

597
00:39:51,466 --> 00:39:52,912
I need you.

598
00:39:53,148 --> 00:39:55,523
I need you now more than ever.

599
00:40:15,717 --> 00:40:16,852
Mouth.

600
00:40:18,325 --> 00:40:19,700
What are you doing here?

601
00:40:20,107 --> 00:40:23,382
You said that you wished the girl in that picture had met me.

602
00:40:23,388 --> 00:40:25,360
I thought maybe she still might have a --

603
00:40:25,365 --> 00:40:27,000
Hey, babe, what are you doing?

604
00:40:27,617 --> 00:40:30,052
Aw, you got flowers. Who are they from?

605
00:40:31,827 --> 00:40:34,910
They're, um -- they're from you.

606
00:41:13,128 --> 00:41:15,181
I'm gonna need a lot of help.

607
00:41:16,656 --> 00:41:19,652
Good, 'cause you're gonna get it.

608
