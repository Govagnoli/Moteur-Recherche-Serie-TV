1
00:00:00,362 --> 00:00:02,142
Previously on One Tree Hill.

2
00:00:02,388 --> 00:00:05,005
I’ve got a way for you to leave but you’ve gotta go in the morning.

3
00:00:05,306 --> 00:00:06,843
- Hey.
- What’s wrong?

4
00:00:06,935 --> 00:00:09,417
You know how much I care about you… Anna.

5
00:00:10,928 --> 00:00:12,203
But there’s somebody else.

6
00:00:13,812 --> 00:00:15,296
Is this what you’re after?

7
00:00:20,559 --> 00:00:21,389
Jake!

8
00:00:22,194 --> 00:00:23,249
I lied to you.

9
00:00:25,301 --> 00:00:26,443
I slept with Keith.

10
00:00:26,847 --> 00:00:28,225
Hey, Jules, it’s Keith.

11
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:30,657
I just realised something and I had to say it.

12
00:00:30,877 --> 00:00:31,785
I love you.

13
00:00:32,926 --> 00:00:36,136
Nice work, Jules. Just like we planned.

14
00:00:36,275 --> 00:00:39,035
Haley, you owe it to your music! You owe it to yourself!

15
00:00:39,131 --> 00:00:40,985
Your dreams are a bus ride away.

16
00:00:41,278 --> 00:00:44,938
I know it’s scary… but just tell me if you can show me your heart.

17
00:00:45,066 --> 00:00:47,785
If you do, I’ll guard it with my life.

18
00:01:06,811 --> 00:01:08,975
Tennessee Williams once wrote…

19
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:12,122
When so many are lonely…

20
00:01:12,213 --> 00:01:16,362
as seem to be lonely, it would be inexcusably selfish…

21
00:01:16,518 --> 00:01:17,841
to be lonely alone.

22
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:38,461
- I don’t even have a toothbrush!
- I think they have those in New York.

23
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,310
I can’t believe I’m doing this.

24
00:01:43,990 --> 00:01:45,819
You did good married girl.

25
00:01:51,635 --> 00:01:52,782
I can’t do this.

26
00:01:58,148 --> 00:01:59,095
I’m sorry.

27
00:02:00,329 --> 00:02:01,431
Yeah, I figured.

28
00:02:08,579 --> 00:02:09,494
You’re not ready.

29
00:02:46,976 --> 00:02:48,532
I’m sorry, Karen.

30
00:02:48,871 --> 00:02:51,440
- I should have told you about Keith, I...
- I think you should go.

31
00:03:10,008 --> 00:03:10,745
Haley?

32
00:03:15,548 --> 00:03:18,193
Whoa! Haley didn’t mess around.

33
00:03:18,793 --> 00:03:22,935
- You’re Nathan, right?
- Yeah, yeah, do I… do I know you?

34
00:03:23,054 --> 00:03:24,994
Well you should; I’m your sister-in-law.

35
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:26,899
Oh, uh… Vivian?

36
00:03:27,011 --> 00:03:28,393
Don’t make me smack you!

37
00:03:29,229 --> 00:03:30,867
- Quinn?
- Taylor!

38
00:03:31,415 --> 00:03:33,042
Haley never mentioned me to you?

39
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:35,720
Can I come in?

40
00:03:42,604 --> 00:03:45,228
- You wanna grab that?
- Wha-excuse me?!

41
00:03:46,419 --> 00:03:49,888
- My suitcase. 
- Oh! Yeah.

42
00:03:51,675 --> 00:03:53,923
So, uh, Haley never said you were coming.

43
00:03:54,001 --> 00:03:57,160
Ah, she didn’t know. So, where is little sis?

44
00:03:58,584 --> 00:03:59,280
Out.

45
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:01,609
Well that’s vague.

46
00:04:02,294 --> 00:04:04,640
Guess we’ll have to get acquainted till she gets home.

47
00:04:05,419 --> 00:04:08,787
Yeah, sure… just make yourself at home.

48
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,424
Careful what you wish for, little brother-in-law.

49
00:04:19,577 --> 00:04:21,914
- Who the hell are you?
- Who the hell are you?

50
00:04:23,273 --> 00:04:25,112
Rick, never mind, I made a mistake.

51
00:04:27,307 --> 00:04:28,930
High school girls!

52
00:04:54,523 --> 00:04:55,573
You were dreaming.

53
00:04:57,155 --> 00:04:58,281
Think you’re okay now.

54
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:00,524
Are you back for good?

55
00:05:01,077 --> 00:05:02,117
Where’s Jenny?

56
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:03,587
I didn’t bring her.

57
00:05:04,067 --> 00:05:06,402
I’m only here a couple days to check on you.

58
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:11,890
So what’s got Lucas so worried he’s gonna call my cousins in Savannah, huh?

59
00:05:12,014 --> 00:05:13,555
Nothing, now…

60
00:05:16,792 --> 00:05:19,162
So… you never answered any of my emails.

61
00:05:19,423 --> 00:05:20,616
Yeah, I’m sorry.

62
00:05:21,517 --> 00:05:24,360
I didn’t wanna give Nikki any chance of tracking me down and…

63
00:05:24,697 --> 00:05:27,790
I just-I didn’t wanna get you caught up in this even more, just in case, you know.

64
00:05:27,851 --> 00:05:28,835
Have you heard from her?

65
00:05:29,525 --> 00:05:30,801
But she’s out there.

66
00:05:31,225 --> 00:05:33,145
She might still be in Seattle.

67
00:05:34,062 --> 00:05:36,099
That’s where Brooke and I told her you went.

68
00:05:38,744 --> 00:05:42,644
Um… what are you gonna see Lucas while you’re here?

69
00:05:42,915 --> 00:05:45,630
I don’t know. I’m gonna see my folks but…

70
00:05:46,115 --> 00:05:48,829
other than that, I just kinda wanna keep a low profile.

71
00:05:49,341 --> 00:05:50,494
Our secret, okay?

72
00:05:50,811 --> 00:05:51,655
Okay.

73
00:05:52,245 --> 00:05:55,440
 Here, you go back to bed. We’ll talk about this in the morning.

74
00:05:57,734 --> 00:06:01,859
- I’ll crash on the floor.
- Jake! Don’t be stupid.

75
00:06:15,819 --> 00:06:17,887
Sounds like it finally stopped raining.

76
00:06:20,417 --> 00:06:21,655
Maybe it finally did.

77
00:06:31,783 --> 00:06:33,007
Where the hell have you been?

78
00:06:34,845 --> 00:06:38,485
I just… I needed to clear my head, Nathan.

79
00:06:38,619 --> 00:06:41,220
Little sis! Look at you!

80
00:06:41,491 --> 00:06:42,765
Tay, what’re you doing here?

81
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:47,201
I’m on break. And I wanted to see the house before the new people moved in,

82
00:06:47,267 --> 00:06:49,484
and I haven’t seen you in forever!

83
00:06:49,582 --> 00:06:52,921
And mom told me that you got married so here I am.

84
00:06:53,085 --> 00:06:55,425
Nathan said I could stay for a couple of days.

85
00:06:55,609 --> 00:06:58,000
- Actually, I...
- You won’t even know that I’m here.

86
00:06:58,409 --> 00:07:02,990
Yeah, okay, um… can you give us a second, please?

87
00:07:08,927 --> 00:07:12,233
You said she could stay? Do you think… maybe that was worth a conversation?


88
00:07:12,327 --> 00:07:16,213
I told her she could make herself comfortable because you weren’t here!

89
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:19,490
You were with Chris again, weren’t you?

90
00:07:19,863 --> 00:07:21,803
- Yes, but I...
- Great! Great!

91
00:07:21,885 --> 00:07:23,565
Will you just listen to me, please?

92
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:28,123
It’s over, okay? He… left town… he wanted me to go with him.

93
00:07:28,215 --> 00:07:32,133
- What?!
- I said no because I-my life is here!

94
00:07:34,098 --> 00:07:36,833
He didn’t mean anything to me, okay?

95
00:07:40,745 --> 00:07:44,642
Besides, we’re gonna have to stick together if we’re gonna… survive ‘Hurricane Taylor’.

96
00:07:56,141 --> 00:07:56,899
Anna!

97
00:08:02,215 --> 00:08:03,105
How are ya?

98
00:08:03,304 --> 00:08:08,302
Well, I was confused, I mean, after you showed up at my door talking about other girls.

99
00:08:08,381 --> 00:08:08,963
Anna...

100
00:08:09,041 --> 00:08:12,414
But, once I remembered you have a reputation for being a total ass-hat,

101
00:08:12,475 --> 00:08:13,951
it pretty much cleared things up!

102
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:30,734
- Nice necklace.
- Thanks, Felix gave it to me.

103
00:08:31,983 --> 00:08:33,458
I thought you guys were done.

104
00:08:34,046 --> 00:08:38,184
That was before we currented up to full-on dating. Thus, the loot.

105
00:08:39,736 --> 00:08:41,164
Are you sure about this?

106
00:08:42,384 --> 00:08:45,475
Look, Lucas, I know you don’t like him but you don’t really know him.

107
00:08:45,747 --> 00:08:48,789
Look, Brooke… I just want you to be happy.

108
00:08:50,309 --> 00:08:55,163
Well, if I’m dating Felix and you’re dating Anna, does that mean we’re somehow related?

109
00:08:55,261 --> 00:08:59,151
- Well, actually, Anna and I...
- Hey Brooke! You forgot something.


110
00:08:59,301 --> 00:09:01,241
- What?
- This.

111
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:05,297
See you after?

112
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:12,216
Lucas, I’m happy. I hope you are too.

113
00:09:25,819 --> 00:09:27,275
- Hello?
- Oh…

114
00:09:27,755 --> 00:09:32,829
Uh, I was looking for Andy Hargrove. Um… I must have dialled… the wrong number.

115
00:09:32,921 --> 00:09:36,746
Actually, I grabbed his phone by mistake. He bought us both the same kind.

116
00:09:37,078 --> 00:09:38,066
Is he there?

117
00:09:38,329 --> 00:09:40,576
He’s in the shower. Who’s this?

118
00:09:41,431 --> 00:09:43,997
Um… A student. I’ll call back.

119
00:09:47,699 --> 00:09:50,826
Karen? Are we ever going to talk?

120
00:09:52,722 --> 00:09:55,472
- What is there to say?
- That I made a mistake.

121
00:09:55,555 --> 00:09:57,734
Maybe what you did with Keith was a mistake…

122
00:09:57,847 --> 00:10:00,519
but lying to me about it was a choice!

123
00:10:00,647 --> 00:10:04,437
One that I can’t accept from a business partner; or my friend.

124
00:10:07,632 --> 00:10:10,023
So, since your mom hired me to work here,

125
00:10:10,090 --> 00:10:13,127
Keith helped me do a crash refresher course on bartending last night.

126
00:10:13,203 --> 00:10:14,263
Ask me anything.

127
00:10:14,564 --> 00:10:17,929
Okay, what’s in a… Long Island ice tea?

128
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:22,004
Wouldn’t you rather have a Screwdriver?

129
00:10:27,068 --> 00:10:28,138
Can you toss me that?

130
00:10:44,201 --> 00:10:46,852
Lucas, Hey! It’s early.

131
00:10:46,961 --> 00:10:50,565
Yeah, I know, uh, can I talk to you?

132
00:10:50,679 --> 00:10:53,024
Sure, I was just meeting Keith for breakfast and…

133
00:10:53,101 --> 00:10:56,428
as usual, I’m late, but other than that… let me grab my shoes.

134
00:10:57,149 --> 00:10:59,645
- Yeah.
- Everything okay?

135
00:10:59,757 --> 00:11:02,439
Well, uh… that’s what I’m here to ask you.

136
00:11:02,526 --> 00:11:07,273
Is this about your mom? Coz Keith told me the whole story and I feel like I’m horning in.

137
00:11:08,268 --> 00:11:09,624
How do you know Dan?

138
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:11,912
Do I know a Dan?

139
00:11:12,168 --> 00:11:14,657
Dan Scott – Keith’s brother?

140
00:11:14,851 --> 00:11:17,100
He called you on your cell yesterday at the club.

141
00:11:17,195 --> 00:11:18,881
Oh, that Dan.

142
00:11:19,428 --> 00:11:20,806
Why’d he call you?

143
00:11:21,477 --> 00:11:23,095
I bought a car from him.

144
00:11:23,448 --> 00:11:26,224
And Dan had some questions about my credit references.

145
00:11:26,541 --> 00:11:27,774
What’s going on?

146
00:11:28,655 --> 00:11:31,636
I’m just, you know… looking out for Keith.

147
00:11:31,851 --> 00:11:34,627
- Keith’s all grown up Lucas.
- Right.

148
00:11:35,328 --> 00:11:37,166
Can we just… forget this?

149
00:11:37,426 --> 00:11:38,609
Forget what?

150
00:11:40,908 --> 00:11:41,692
Thanks.

151
00:11:53,873 --> 00:11:57,590
Whoa! Peyton, this place is amazing!

152
00:11:57,867 --> 00:12:02,327
Thanks. It can be, it’s just… it’s harder than I thought.

153
00:12:03,054 --> 00:12:04,881
Well when did you ever give up, huh?

154
00:12:06,551 --> 00:12:10,851
Um… anyway, the uh, the big news is: Nathan and Haley got married!

155
00:12:10,934 --> 00:12:11,783
Married?

156
00:12:12,056 --> 00:12:13,336
- For real?
- Yeah.

157
00:12:13,469 --> 00:12:18,564
And it turns out Haley is, like, this mega talented musician and she’s going for it.

158
00:12:21,144 --> 00:12:22,357
What’s the face?

159
00:12:24,037 --> 00:12:27,539
Well, when I got off the bus, I saw Haley kissing some guy.

160
00:12:27,739 --> 00:12:32,284
He was… kinda scrawny; had a guitar case; sort of… hell-t hair.

161
00:12:33,734 --> 00:12:37,088
- Who’s he?
- Someone she shouldn’t be kissing.

162
00:12:40,837 --> 00:12:42,782
Hey! Open up top!

163
00:12:43,214 --> 00:12:48,164
Huh… see, I don’t know CPR and even if I did, I wouldn’t give you mouth-to-mouth so…

164
00:12:48,277 --> 00:12:50,105
try not to drop when I’m the only person around.

165
00:12:50,218 --> 00:12:52,024
I’m getting the stupid test, give me the damn ball.

166
00:12:52,137 --> 00:12:52,967
Forget it.

167
00:13:00,423 --> 00:13:01,451
Nice air-ball.

168
00:13:02,501 --> 00:13:04,392
How bout Playstation? Nobody ever croaked from that.

169
00:13:04,493 --> 00:13:05,982
That would involve me going home.

170
00:13:06,996 --> 00:13:09,945
- You and Haley still fighting?
- Her sister’s here for a few days.

171
00:13:10,043 --> 00:13:11,227
Which one?

172
00:13:11,702 --> 00:13:12,547
Taylor.

173
00:13:13,049 --> 00:13:13,966
Taylor?

174
00:13:15,579 --> 00:13:17,154
Dude, she’s crazy.

175
00:13:17,509 --> 00:13:22,613
Perfect! Dude, the thing is… when I saw her, I got that… déjà vu thing.

176
00:13:22,696 --> 00:13:25,056
Like uh… like I’d seen her before.

177
00:13:25,286 --> 00:13:28,893
Well, when we were freshman she was a senior so you probably saw her around school.

178
00:13:29,088 --> 00:13:32,030
Yeah, I’m pretty sure I’ve seen more of her than that.

179
00:13:33,228 --> 00:13:36,229
Two years ago, when they put me on varsity from the freshmen team…

180
00:13:36,301 --> 00:13:41,062
the seniors threw this, kinda, out-there party at my parent’s beach house…

181
00:13:42,158 --> 00:13:43,433
Taylor was there.

182
00:13:43,971 --> 00:13:45,063
This is ugly.

183
00:13:45,409 --> 00:13:50,001
Yeah, I was… I was pretty wasted… and… she was…

184
00:13:51,421 --> 00:13:54,524
she was kinda the first girl I ever had sex with.

185
00:13:55,645 --> 00:13:57,693
Great! Great. Laugh it up.

186
00:13:57,930 --> 00:14:02,603
You know what; the only good news about this is that I don’t think she really even remembers me.

187
00:14:02,685 --> 00:14:04,728
Oh, wow, you rocked her world, huh?

188
00:14:05,210 --> 00:14:08,441
- This is not funny!
- You’re right, it’s hilarious!

189
00:14:08,784 --> 00:14:12,102
Whoa! Hey, hey, hey, heart patient, remember?!

190
00:14:14,211 --> 00:14:15,298
How bad is it?

191
00:14:16,005 --> 00:14:20,818
Well, let’s see – my mom threw our last piece of water fern at my dad last night…

192
00:14:20,903 --> 00:14:25,056
and it shattered where the hopper used to hang and now he’s sleeping in the pool house…

193
00:14:25,144 --> 00:14:27,130
while we still have one. So…

194
00:14:28,191 --> 00:14:30,448
They talking about moving? Say no.

195
00:14:30,802 --> 00:14:34,192
Not so much talking as yelling, constantly.

196
00:14:34,585 --> 00:14:37,694
It’s kinda gotten to the point where I just don’t wanna go home, you know?

197
00:14:39,838 --> 00:14:40,960
Then we won’t.

198
00:14:42,184 --> 00:14:44,191
Come on, I’ll buy you a nice dinner.

199
00:14:45,184 --> 00:14:49,102
No. No, no, no, no! Felix, we can’t go in there, are you crazy?!

200
00:14:49,198 --> 00:14:49,967
Why not?

201
00:14:50,264 --> 00:14:55,491
Because this is the place that you made me do… do the dine-and-dash thing on Dare Night!

202
00:14:56,541 --> 00:14:58,630
- What is so funny?
- You.

203
00:14:59,096 --> 00:15:01,021
Do you honestly think I’d do that to you?

204
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:03,849
I paid the matredee on the way out when I left you.

205
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:09,225
- I’m full of surprises.
- You’re full of something.

206
00:15:17,029 --> 00:15:23,152
You’re home. Sorry bout the mess. I needed a major, hot, soak after my ten mile run.

207
00:15:23,403 --> 00:15:24,222
You run?

208
00:15:24,452 --> 00:15:26,346
Well how do you think I got this great ass?

209
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:29,568
Are you blushing?

210
00:15:30,653 --> 00:15:31,739
Adorable!

211
00:15:32,645 --> 00:15:36,515
Run with me tomorrow. If… you can keep up.

212
00:15:36,796 --> 00:15:37,994
If you can keep up.

213
00:15:39,490 --> 00:15:41,573
I… bought some beer; you want one?

214
00:15:41,692 --> 00:15:43,781
Uh… yeah… sure.

215
00:15:47,878 --> 00:15:50,126
Look at you – such a jock!

216
00:15:51,467 --> 00:15:53,515
So, come talk to me.

217
00:15:54,021 --> 00:15:55,222
How bad is it?


218
00:15:57,521 --> 00:15:58,922
How bad is what?

219
00:16:00,069 --> 00:16:02,542
This thing between you and Haley.

220
00:16:02,850 --> 00:16:07,437
Dinner chucked in the garbage; little sis coming home in the middle of the night;

221
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:09,884
hushed arguments behind closed doors.

222
00:16:10,375 --> 00:16:12,833
Though that and… she told me all about it.

223
00:16:12,961 --> 00:16:15,880
And she told you that Chris is out of the picture, right?

224
00:16:16,576 --> 00:16:19,568
Chris… right.

225
00:16:19,663 --> 00:16:21,619
You’re pretty threatened by him, huh?

226
00:16:22,152 --> 00:16:25,066
Only because Haley was buying his crap.

227
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:28,323
For a smart girl, Haley sure can be stupid.

228
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,787
What’s… your issue with Haley?

229
00:16:33,777 --> 00:16:37,094
I think she blames me for all the pressure she puts on herself.

230
00:16:37,263 --> 00:16:38,160
How so?

231
00:16:39,363 --> 00:16:42,613
I dunno, she didn’t wanna disappoint our parents like I did, I guess.

232
00:16:43,791 --> 00:16:46,160
I tend to screw up, a lot.

233
00:16:46,617 --> 00:16:49,623
Yeah, uh, I know how that is.

234
00:16:50,166 --> 00:16:50,831
Really?

235
00:16:58,215 --> 00:16:59,628
Mind if I get another beer?

236
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:03,351
- No, I insist.
- Yeah, okay.

237
00:17:06,290 --> 00:17:12,786
You know, I still can’t believe little sis snagged such a hottie. I mean, usually, I get them first.

238
00:17:20,662 --> 00:17:24,078
You want anything else; after-dinner drink, dessert, new shoes?

239
00:17:24,170 --> 00:17:25,952
You don’t have to buy me things.

240
00:17:26,705 --> 00:17:29,136
- Debit card ok?
- Of course.

241
00:17:29,224 --> 00:17:32,331
- Felix!
- It’s okay, Brooke. You’re with me now.

242
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:35,045
I’m gonna take care of you.

243
00:17:43,008 --> 00:17:46,151
- Looks like you were hungry.
- Yeah, I had a friend over.

244
00:17:46,868 --> 00:17:48,097
You just missed him.

245
00:17:48,465 --> 00:17:49,248
Him?

246
00:17:50,443 --> 00:17:52,291
Oh it’s… not like that.

247
00:17:53,334 --> 00:17:56,592
Um… I was gonna call you, it’s just…

248
00:17:56,750 --> 00:18:03,888
um, last time I saw you it was… pile-on-Peyton day. You know? So, um, sorry.

249
00:18:04,874 --> 00:18:06,577
Well, you had a right to be pissed at me.

250
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:11,809
You needed a friend… and… I wasn’t there for you.

251
00:18:13,981 --> 00:18:20,371
Anyway, can I, um… still take you up on that ‘we can talk anytime’ offer?

252
00:18:20,673 --> 00:18:23,756
Yeah! Come on, what’s up?

253
00:18:25,707 --> 00:18:28,251
Lucas, kinda… broke up with me.

254
00:18:29,024 --> 00:18:34,104
I mean… I’m not sure if we were even dating but, now there’s not even a chance.

255
00:18:34,928 --> 00:18:36,238
I’m sorry, Anna.

256
00:18:38,369 --> 00:18:40,068
I don’t know what I’m doing, Peyton.

257
00:18:40,616 --> 00:18:41,876
None of us do.

258
00:18:43,730 --> 00:18:45,638
Do you think there’s something wrong with me?

259
00:18:45,931 --> 00:18:48,118
What?! No!

260
00:18:48,825 --> 00:18:54,288
I think maybe there’s something wrong with Lucas; coz you are great.

261
00:18:56,709 --> 00:18:57,606
Come here.

262
00:19:13,163 --> 00:19:15,409
- On my god!
- Anna, that not really my thing.

263
00:19:15,486 --> 00:19:16,479
I’m sorry.

264
00:19:16,566 --> 00:19:19,290
- I’m-I gotta go.
- But, it’s cool, Anna!

265
00:19:30,662 --> 00:19:33,120
Hey, I hope this is okay.

266
00:19:35,101 --> 00:19:38,875
Look… I don’t know what came over me.

267
00:19:38,993 --> 00:19:43,816
I was just… pretty upset and… you know, I wasn’t really thinking straight.

268
00:19:45,357 --> 00:19:46,535
You know what I mean?

269
00:19:46,786 --> 00:19:49,935
Anna! It’s cool… Okay?

270
00:19:50,001 --> 00:19:55,269
I mean, now a lot of stuff makes sense like: how you acted at the Formal and…

271
00:19:55,676 --> 00:19:58,226
how you blew me off after the whole locker thing.

272
00:19:58,327 --> 00:20:00,431
Can we please just forget the whole thing?

273
00:20:00,810 --> 00:20:02,689
Absolutely not!

274
00:20:03,719 --> 00:20:06,356
Don’t be afraid to be who you are.

275
00:20:09,894 --> 00:20:11,748
We can still be friends, right?

276
00:20:13,811 --> 00:20:15,404
I don’t know if I can do that.

277
00:20:24,553 --> 00:20:27,330
- Mine!
- Beat the girl! Such a gentleman!

278
00:20:27,671 --> 00:20:29,950
Sorry. Good run.

279
00:20:30,688 --> 00:20:33,427
Yeah. If I don’t run everyday, I got nuts.

280
00:20:34,068 --> 00:20:37,074
Started when I left home; been running ever since.

281
00:20:37,621 --> 00:20:38,768
I know the feeling.

282
00:20:39,122 --> 00:20:41,581
Now I am all about the future.

283
00:20:43,664 --> 00:20:48,349
Speaking for which – we haven’t had our mollocarian bathing ritual yet.

284
00:20:48,768 --> 00:20:49,720
A what?

285
00:20:50,238 --> 00:20:55,178
The mollocars, are a tribe in the South Pacific who celebrate weddings with a family bath.

286
00:20:55,393 --> 00:20:58,840
- They must have a big tub.
- In the ocean dumbass.

287
00:20:59,147 --> 00:20:59,910
Ah, what!

288
00:21:00,017 --> 00:21:04,379
It symbolises the washing away of past sins and the rebirth of the family’s soul.

289
00:21:04,493 --> 00:21:06,290
You have any idea how cold that water is?

290
00:21:06,405 --> 00:21:10,366
Yeah, but I’m gonna appeal to you competitive side, sissy!

291
00:21:10,791 --> 00:21:13,510
Alright! On three.

292
00:21:14,088 --> 00:21:17,503
- One, two...
- Three!

293
00:21:17,663 --> 00:21:19,628
What-get back here!

294
00:21:20,622 --> 00:21:22,240
Oh! It’s cold!

295
00:21:26,188 --> 00:21:29,864
Got you! Mollocai’s is a bar in Durham!

296
00:21:29,951 --> 00:21:30,832
What?

297
00:21:34,629 --> 00:21:35,870
I warned you, man.

298
00:21:39,151 --> 00:21:41,932
You know, this is really getting old.

299
00:21:42,235 --> 00:21:45,911
Heh, not as old as you hurting my sister. She’s at home, crying, coz of you.

300
00:21:46,024 --> 00:21:49,673
I’m sorry man, but I don’t see how any of this is your business.

301
00:21:49,798 --> 00:21:51,379
Coz I make it my business.

302
00:21:51,579 --> 00:21:53,074
You hurt her, I hurt you.

303
00:21:55,988 --> 00:21:57,390
You don’t wanna do that.

304
00:21:58,001 --> 00:22:00,392
You’re right, what I wanna be doing is this.

305
00:22:12,090 --> 00:22:13,105
Forget it!

306
00:22:21,517 --> 00:22:22,548
Yeah, one more thing.

307
00:22:35,808 --> 00:22:38,671
Damn, boy! Why aren’t we living here?

308
00:22:38,825 --> 00:22:41,179
It’s my dad’s. Got the keys though.

309
00:22:41,917 --> 00:22:45,241
Tell you what – I’ll turn on the fireplace if you grab the towels.

310
00:22:45,342 --> 00:22:46,588
- They’re just...
- I know where they are.

311
00:22:47,279 --> 00:22:48,753
Varsity basketball.

312
00:22:51,358 --> 00:22:53,340
Yeah. Um…

313
00:22:54,733 --> 00:22:57,857
- I was pretty wasted that night.
- Oh, what, you don’t remember me?

314
00:22:57,990 --> 00:23:00,197
No, of course I remember you, I just…

315
00:23:01,083 --> 00:23:03,245
I didn’t think you would come back to bite me in the ass.

316
00:23:03,783 --> 00:23:06,045
Well this time I’ll only nibble.

317
00:23:09,531 --> 00:23:10,846
Why didn’t you say anything?

318
00:23:11,108 --> 00:23:13,734
I was having too much fun watching you squirm.

319
00:23:18,927 --> 00:23:20,483
Does that make me bad?

320
00:23:24,512 --> 00:23:25,297
Here.

321
00:23:36,101 --> 00:23:37,970
So are you gonna tell me why you’re really in town?

322
00:23:38,491 --> 00:23:41,871
I… screwed up at school.

323
00:23:42,486 --> 00:23:44,968
I got caught cheating on an exam…

324
00:23:45,164 --> 00:23:48,331
and then my professor and I got caught cheating on his wife!

325
00:23:48,971 --> 00:23:51,538
He was paying my rent; expenses.

326
00:23:52,690 --> 00:23:55,839
Yeah, until she found out and then that was that.

327
00:23:56,925 --> 00:24:00,016
So, I… got kicked out.

328
00:24:00,213 --> 00:24:03,944
And, next thing, I’m… knocking on your door.

329
00:24:05,198 --> 00:24:06,848
So how bout we make a deal?

330
00:24:08,241 --> 00:24:12,179
You keep my secret… and I’ll keep yours.

331
00:24:13,099 --> 00:24:15,351
That sounds like a good plan.

332
00:24:18,609 --> 00:24:22,178
Speaking of Haley – uh, we should get back.

333
00:24:23,027 --> 00:24:27,190
I guess we could do that. This time.

334
00:24:32,337 --> 00:24:37,144
You know… how you find a song and you just listen to it, like, over and over and over again,

335
00:24:37,209 --> 00:24:42,930
until it becomes this, like, soundtrack, until you find… a new one?

336
00:24:43,606 --> 00:24:47,089
Or, till you wanna forget the things that it reminds you of.

337
00:24:48,717 --> 00:24:49,972
How’s you life, Jake?

338
00:24:50,703 --> 00:24:51,748
It’s been hard.

339
00:24:53,519 --> 00:24:57,212
You know, I’m not in school and… I’m working all these crummy jobs

340
00:24:57,282 --> 00:24:59,275
and the whole time I just keep looking over my shoulder

341
00:24:59,366 --> 00:25:02,572
thinking that Nikki’s gonna swoop down and snatch Jenny away.

342
00:25:05,701 --> 00:25:07,580
You know I have to go back, Peyton.

343
00:25:08,813 --> 00:25:09,782
I know.

344
00:25:10,468 --> 00:25:11,890
I’d stay if I could.

345
00:25:12,793 --> 00:25:13,986
I want you to know that.

346
00:25:18,439 --> 00:25:20,325
So, when are you leaving?

347
00:25:21,153 --> 00:25:21,983
Tomorrow.

348
00:25:23,812 --> 00:25:26,925
I promised my folks - I’d have dinner with them tonight.

349
00:25:27,687 --> 00:25:30,605
But… I’ll stop by – in the morning, before I head out.

350
00:25:30,693 --> 00:25:31,568
Jake...

351
00:25:33,995 --> 00:25:37,809
can you stay here again, tonight? Just to sleep.

352
00:25:41,537 --> 00:25:42,996
I’ll come back after dinner.

353
00:25:55,291 --> 00:25:58,609
I thought that since you wouldn’t answer my calls, maybe you’d been abducted or something.

354
00:25:58,804 --> 00:26:00,458
I assume your mother has an accent?

355
00:26:01,753 --> 00:26:03,684
Ah… not to me but yeah.

356
00:26:03,832 --> 00:26:05,199
And you said you don’t have a sister.

357
00:26:05,296 --> 00:26:08,086
Just one loser brother. What’s this about?

358
00:26:09,402 --> 00:26:13,714
I called you in New York; and a woman answered and said you were in the shower.

359
00:26:13,816 --> 00:26:17,170
Now this may not be fair to you but with everyone lying to me lately,

360
00:26:18,333 --> 00:26:19,475
who is she?

361
00:26:20,621 --> 00:26:22,214
Look, Karen, um…

362
00:26:22,977 --> 00:26:25,040
this is something that I’m not really proud of but...

363
00:26:25,122 --> 00:26:29,623
Tell you what – from now on; I’m the student, you’re the professor…

364
00:26:29,704 --> 00:26:31,127
and I’ll see you in class!

365
00:26:37,288 --> 00:26:39,685
Oh, nice, you guys finally decided to come home.

366
00:26:39,965 --> 00:26:42,004
I left you a note. We went for a jog.

367
00:26:42,110 --> 00:26:43,294
To where – Atlanta?

368
00:26:43,436 --> 00:26:46,222
I’m… gonna… go take a shower.

369
00:26:49,422 --> 00:26:51,854
We are supposed to be working on our marriage.

370
00:26:51,937 --> 00:26:53,544
At least you knew where I was.

371
00:26:54,641 --> 00:26:56,541
This has to stop, Nathan.

372
00:26:57,964 --> 00:27:02,530
I don’t wanna lose you and it’s obvious that we still have issues; only now it just feels like you’re avoiding me.

373
00:27:02,604 --> 00:27:03,651
I’m not avoiding you!

374
00:27:03,744 --> 00:27:05,521
Then why are you spending so much time with Taylor?

375
00:27:05,619 --> 00:27:07,237
Wha-are you threatened by her?

376
00:27:07,708 --> 00:27:09,063
I don’t trust her.

377
00:27:19,474 --> 00:27:21,368
Whoa girl, you look happy.

378
00:27:21,678 --> 00:27:23,120
I can’t keep this.

379
00:27:27,164 --> 00:27:27,948
Why not?

380
00:27:28,752 --> 00:27:32,556
Because my mom married my dad for his money and you see how well that worked out.

381
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:36,750
- You think that’s all this is?
- I don’t wanna be like her.

382
00:27:37,083 --> 00:27:41,752
And you’re giving me nice gifts and buying me expensive meals and I don’t wanna do it anymore.

383
00:27:42,530 --> 00:27:46,426
- You’re breaking up with me?
- No! Just with your money.

384
00:27:47,246 --> 00:27:52,232
I need to start feeling good about myself so I can start feeling good about us. Okay?

385
00:27:53,355 --> 00:27:54,307
Okay.

386
00:28:00,324 --> 00:28:02,229
I really don’t wanna go home.

387
00:28:02,607 --> 00:28:05,438
- Spend the night with me.
- I’m not in the mood.

388
00:28:05,915 --> 00:28:09,433
So? Spend the night anyway.

389
00:28:13,631 --> 00:28:16,063
You really are full of surprises, aren’t you?

390
00:28:31,302 --> 00:28:32,540
Trouble sleeping?

391
00:28:35,413 --> 00:28:37,297
Just listening to you breathe.

392
00:28:39,586 --> 00:28:41,014
Been thinking about stuff.

393
00:28:43,043 --> 00:28:46,303
Alright Peyton, I gotta ask you – the other night, when I found you…

394
00:28:48,070 --> 00:28:50,810
that was a drug deal. Am I right?

395
00:28:51,061 --> 00:28:54,225
- I mean, Lucas called me for a reason...
- I…

396
00:28:58,291 --> 00:29:06,995
I did coke with that guy… but it was… it was one time and… it was stupid. I know.

397
00:29:07,333 --> 00:29:10,569
You’ve got so much going on, why would you need a crush like that?

398
00:29:12,459 --> 00:29:13,704
I was weak.

399
00:29:16,888 --> 00:29:19,546
- You don’t have to worry about me, Jake.
- I know.

400
00:29:22,192 --> 00:29:23,703
But what if I want to?

401
00:29:30,623 --> 00:29:31,756
Hey, Jules.

402
00:29:31,864 --> 00:29:35,997
- Lucas, people are gonna start talking if you keep...
- You lied to me about how you know Dan.

403
00:29:36,893 --> 00:29:38,773
I checked you out at the dealership.

404
00:29:39,956 --> 00:29:41,246
Come inside, okay?

405
00:29:46,058 --> 00:29:52,914
So, I know you paid cash for the car; which means, there was no credit check.

406
00:29:54,557 --> 00:29:57,098
Bout two years ago, I was engaged to this guy.

407
00:29:58,183 --> 00:30:01,931
I was crazy about him; even after he hit me a few times.

408
00:30:02,228 --> 00:30:06,181
I thought it wasn’t gonna happen again… until he put me in the hospital for two weeks.

409
00:30:07,097 --> 00:30:09,090
He disappeared after that and…

410
00:30:09,412 --> 00:30:13,437
my welcome home present was finding out that I was over a hundred and fifty thousand dollars in debt;

411
00:30:13,687 --> 00:30:15,721
with no way to pay the medical bills.

412
00:30:17,671 --> 00:30:19,629
I was beyond desperate, Lucas.

413
00:30:21,992 --> 00:30:24,152
So I posted an add on this website;

414
00:30:26,309 --> 00:30:28,413
saying I’d do anything, legal, for money.

415
00:30:28,997 --> 00:30:30,482
And Dan answered.

416
00:30:31,368 --> 00:30:35,336
Said he’d help me out. He started paying my medical bills.

417
00:30:38,702 --> 00:30:42,868
So, what did he ask you to do?

418
00:30:43,974 --> 00:30:45,623
Make Keith fall in love with me.

419
00:30:47,799 --> 00:30:49,089
Then break his heart.

420
00:30:52,636 --> 00:30:56,002
I tried to tell Dan that I wasn’t gonna go through with it but its too late.

421
00:30:57,611 --> 00:31:00,089
I never though I was gonna fall in love with Keith.

422
00:31:00,970 --> 00:31:02,526
But I did, Lucas.

423
00:31:03,228 --> 00:31:04,875
You have to believe me;

424
00:31:05,792 --> 00:31:06,964
I love him!

425
00:31:17,701 --> 00:31:21,973
Thought I was having a… bad dream only to wake up and find out its real.

426
00:31:23,083 --> 00:31:24,932
But, I know that you have to go.

427
00:31:25,255 --> 00:31:27,830
Last night, you said you were feeling weak.

428
00:31:28,885 --> 00:31:31,476
Well here, let me show you something I use when I’m feeling weak.

429
00:31:34,906 --> 00:31:38,705
‘If my hopes could bring you home, you and Jenny would be with me now’.

430
00:31:38,828 --> 00:31:40,893
It’s the first email I sent you?

431
00:31:42,029 --> 00:31:44,876
It’s like, I’d be working one of those jobs or…

432
00:31:45,218 --> 00:31:49,305
feeling like I was gonna be on the run forever and I would-I’d read those words and…

433
00:31:51,215 --> 00:31:55,050
it’s like this sudden calm… would wash over me.

434
00:31:55,833 --> 00:31:57,646
You’re so strong, Peyton.

435
00:31:58,260 --> 00:31:59,750
You don’t even know it.

436
00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:02,972
I mean, you got me through some pretty dark days.

437
00:32:03,981 --> 00:32:10,314
And… I’ve been thinking that, if I can get all that… from some words on a piece of paper…

438
00:32:11,874 --> 00:32:15,189
just imagine what it would be like to have the real thing every day.

439
00:32:17,794 --> 00:32:19,955
I’m just-I’m tired of running, Peyton;

440
00:32:20,739 --> 00:32:24,184
come with me, let’s bring Jenny back home.

441
00:32:25,244 --> 00:32:26,969
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

442
00:32:28,398 --> 00:32:29,300
Yeah.

443
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:36,366
- What are you doing?
- I’m helping you pack!

444
00:32:37,093 --> 00:32:39,814
- Am I packing?
- That’s where I’m sending you; packing.

445
00:32:39,908 --> 00:32:40,912
Wait a minute, Haley.

446
00:32:41,056 --> 00:32:43,955
You know what; complain window is close, okay? It’s time for you to go back to school.


447
00:32:44,256 --> 00:32:46,655
- I’m… done with school.
- Well, I’m sorry.

448
00:32:46,762 --> 00:32:51,005
I need to be here, working on saving my marriage and you’re getting in the way!

449
00:32:51,562 --> 00:32:54,737
- I need a few days to figure things out.
- A few days is gonna turn into a few weeks.

450
00:32:54,809 --> 00:32:57,332
I know you, Taylor. By then, it might be too late for Nathan and me.

451
00:32:57,409 --> 00:32:58,956
We have to let her stay, Haley.

452
00:33:00,626 --> 00:33:01,751
She’s family.

453
00:33:05,941 --> 00:33:08,449
Just until you figure out what you’re gonna do, alright?

454
00:33:09,183 --> 00:33:11,506
Sure. Thanks, Nathan.

455
00:33:20,407 --> 00:33:24,784
Today, we’re gonna pick up with managerial ethics; where we left off just before my trip.

456
00:33:35,009 --> 00:33:37,686
Actually, no, change of plan, forget that.

457
00:33:37,855 --> 00:33:41,002
Who can tell me the word that I wrote on the board on the first day?

458
00:33:42,888 --> 00:33:43,795
Karen?

459
00:33:46,953 --> 00:33:48,787
- Greed.
- That’s right.

460
00:33:48,952 --> 00:33:52,722
It’s a motivating factor in business, religion, politics.

461
00:33:53,052 --> 00:33:55,351
I mean, I know it sure as hell motivated me.

462
00:33:56,345 --> 00:33:57,564
Or it used to.

463
00:33:58,388 --> 00:34:01,435
Three years ago, I was barrelling along in my SUV,

464
00:34:01,541 --> 00:34:05,250
on my way to yet another meeting with yet another financial group.

465
00:34:05,484 --> 00:34:09,253
At that point in time, my liquid assets totalled around thirty-one million.

466
00:34:09,367 --> 00:34:11,245
On my cell I had a broker…

467
00:34:11,423 --> 00:34:14,424
who could have, uh, pushed my net-worth up by another quarter of a million.

468
00:34:14,538 --> 00:34:17,768
And I was so on my game this day. I mean, I was saying all the right things;

469
00:34:17,861 --> 00:34:20,963
I was turning all the right screws… when, um…

470
00:34:25,581 --> 00:34:26,975
I didn’t even see her –

471
00:34:28,218 --> 00:34:29,949
until I got out of the car.

472
00:34:31,136 --> 00:34:35,161
By that time, she was lying in a-in a pretty impossible angle and there was…

473
00:34:35,504 --> 00:34:38,249
so much blood that I was sure that I’d killed her.

474
00:34:41,429 --> 00:34:43,854
But she survived. Her name is Miriam…

475
00:34:44,844 --> 00:34:48,731
and, uh, she’s gonna carry that accident around with her forever.

476
00:34:49,667 --> 00:34:50,872
As will I.

477
00:34:52,299 --> 00:34:55,613
Since then, I’ve tried to do right by her and… twice a year,

478
00:34:57,272 --> 00:34:59,181
I visit her and her son.

479
00:35:00,231 --> 00:35:01,715
To make sure they’re okay.

480
00:35:02,735 --> 00:35:06,431
And some people say that I do that out of guilt; that may be but…

481
00:35:06,524 --> 00:35:10,411
there’s another reason that I do it; I do it to remind myself that in this life,

482
00:35:11,254 --> 00:35:13,667
there’s a point when enough’s enough.

483
00:35:14,363 --> 00:35:17,107
Now if you’re haggling over money that you don’t even need;

484
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:18,429
enough’s enough.

485
00:35:20,124 --> 00:35:23,395
Just… believe me on that.

486
00:35:28,709 --> 00:35:33,917
So, if you’ll still have me, um… managerial ethics.

487
00:35:36,208 --> 00:35:38,644
- Tunes for the road?
- Yep, right here!

488
00:35:38,766 --> 00:35:40,641
- You got your bag?
- In the trunk!

489
00:35:40,762 --> 00:35:45,264
Beef jerky? Oh, come on, you can’t have a road trip without beef jerky. You’re buying.

490
00:35:45,372 --> 00:35:49,248
Okay, how bout, I got my debit card; we’ll just stop at the first truck stop!

491
00:35:49,345 --> 00:35:50,512
Now we’re talking.

492
00:35:51,917 --> 00:35:53,370
Top up or top down?

493
00:35:54,445 --> 00:35:55,336
Down.

494
00:35:56,464 --> 00:35:58,131
I don’t think it’s gonna rain today.

495
00:36:14,041 --> 00:36:19,150
I know you have no reason to believe anything I say, but, I feel awful about this, Karen.

496
00:36:19,769 --> 00:36:22,596
Our friendship has gotten me through some pretty dark days.

497
00:36:22,841 --> 00:36:24,919
I never meant to betray that.

498
00:36:25,853 --> 00:36:31,470
But… I can have my lawyer drop off the papers to dissolve our partnership, if that’s what you want.

499
00:36:31,802 --> 00:36:33,226
It isn’t, Deb.

500
00:36:34,829 --> 00:36:37,921
Just… please don’t lie to me again.

501
00:36:42,691 --> 00:36:44,336
Felix told me what happened.

502
00:36:47,404 --> 00:36:48,362
I’ll live.

503
00:36:50,107 --> 00:36:53,329
I kind of owe you the biggest apology in the world, Lucas.

504
00:36:53,947 --> 00:36:54,674
Me?

505
00:36:55,129 --> 00:36:55,873
Yeah.

506
00:36:56,845 --> 00:36:57,798
Coz, um…

507
00:36:59,894 --> 00:37:03,921
I’ve been blaming a lot of stuff on you that isn’t your fault.

508
00:37:05,822 --> 00:37:09,406
The last place we lived, the all-girls school I went to,

509
00:37:10,072 --> 00:37:13,588
there were these… rumours that got started and…

510
00:37:14,090 --> 00:37:20,068
my family found out and… I made a big deal out of it all… and we moved.

511
00:37:20,405 --> 00:37:22,811
Felix was pissed at me because of that.

512
00:37:24,701 --> 00:37:28,915
But the thing is, Lucas, those rumours, weren’t just rumours.

513
00:37:31,818 --> 00:37:32,984
They were true.

514
00:37:35,561 --> 00:37:37,410
What were the rumours?

515
00:37:39,304 --> 00:37:40,948
That I like girls.

516
00:37:47,251 --> 00:37:51,450
You’re the first person I have ever said those words to out loud.

517
00:37:52,099 --> 00:37:53,139
Okay.

518
00:37:54,291 --> 00:37:59,569
I mean, I’m into guys too so its a-it’s kind of confusing and…

519
00:38:00,573 --> 00:38:05,059
I guess I put all my hopes on you; which wasn’t fair.

520
00:38:05,166 --> 00:38:11,494
I thought since… you liked me and I liked you, maybe… that would make it go away.

521
00:38:13,195 --> 00:38:18,541
Until you broke things off and then… there I was – right back where I started.

522
00:38:20,773 --> 00:38:23,640
I’m not proud of it but that’s why I was mad at you.

523
00:38:25,191 --> 00:38:27,445
Only I guess I was really mad at myself.

524
00:38:28,136 --> 00:38:31,106
Wow, huh, this is a new one.

525
00:38:32,918 --> 00:38:37,849
I’m not ready for people to know; especially Felix!

526
00:38:38,981 --> 00:38:40,721
I won’t say anything.

527
00:38:42,130 --> 00:38:43,088
Thanks.

528
00:38:44,946 --> 00:38:47,993
And, I won’t say anything about you and Brooke.

529
00:38:49,111 --> 00:38:51,290
What about me and Brooke?

530
00:38:52,693 --> 00:38:54,823
She’s the girl you like, right?

531
00:38:55,233 --> 00:38:57,588
I mean, it’s kind of obvious.

532
00:38:59,959 --> 00:39:02,038
I thought I was cooler than that.

533
00:39:02,365 --> 00:39:04,726
Well, apparently not!

534
00:39:07,378 --> 00:39:08,593
Come here.

535
00:39:32,442 --> 00:39:34,951
- I want you to have this.
- Felix...

536
00:39:35,050 --> 00:39:37,470
It’s a gift. It’s not a payment.

537
00:39:38,709 --> 00:39:41,127
And I didn’t buy it for you as much as I bought it for me.

538
00:39:42,871 --> 00:39:44,976
Coz seeing you wear it makes me happy.

539
00:40:02,704 --> 00:40:03,691
Sandwiches?

540
00:40:07,629 --> 00:40:10,392
You like crow? Coz I’ve been craving it lately.

541
00:40:11,577 --> 00:40:12,648
Don’t worry about it.

542
00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:15,668
It’s about time I owned up to my mistakes.

543
00:40:15,887 --> 00:40:16,810
Me too.

544
00:40:24,408 --> 00:40:26,046
This isn’t really crow, I hope.

545
00:40:26,154 --> 00:40:27,393
Turkey with Swiss.

546
00:40:28,151 --> 00:40:29,702
Apologies on the side.

547
00:40:45,310 --> 00:40:48,826
- Hey!
- Keith, uh, can I talk to you?

548
00:40:48,926 --> 00:40:50,927
Sure. Come on in.

549
00:40:51,347 --> 00:40:52,652
You know, um,

550
00:40:55,032 --> 00:40:57,982
did I happen to leave my… MP3 player here?

551
00:40:58,120 --> 00:40:59,523
Uh, no, haven’t seen it.

552
00:40:59,928 --> 00:41:00,856
Right, um…


553
00:41:01,928 --> 00:41:03,856
Oh, what, you wanna come in and hang out?

554
00:41:04,822 --> 00:41:06,271
No, I’m okay.

555
00:41:06,958 --> 00:41:07,911
See ya.

556
00:41:27,973 --> 00:41:29,278
Feeling left out?

557
00:41:30,287 --> 00:41:31,291
A little.

558
00:41:32,668 --> 00:41:34,818
Well, you wanna be left out together?

559
00:41:57,905 --> 00:42:00,011
Hey, uh, do you need some help?

560
00:42:00,973 --> 00:42:02,155
Yeah, sure.
