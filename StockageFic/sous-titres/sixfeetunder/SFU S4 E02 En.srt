1
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:51,278
Why do they want these
filled with fuckin' helium?

2
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:53,550
Lt's for the AVN Awards, man.

3
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:58,549
It's like the fucking Oscars of porn.
They want 'em floating from the rafters.

4
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,397
Check this out.

5
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:03,674
Fuck me! L have several fuckable orifices!

6
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,557
Wait, wait, wait.

7
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:16,033
No, fuck me! I'm a chick with a dick!

8
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:20,631
- Then you can fuck yourself!
- No, fuck you!

9
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,552
Oh shit, my dick fell off!

10
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:32,513
Holy shit. I think this chick's my cousin.
Watch out!

11
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:36,317
- You almost hit that guy.
- I did not.

12
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:39,113
- You did.
- Well, he came from nowhere.

13
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:42,948
<i>It's not just wives who need</i>
<i>to give themselves freely to their husbands</i>

14
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,994
<i>within the blessed confines of the marriage</i>
<i>bed, husbands need to surrender as well</i>...

15
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:51,032
- Praise the Lord.
- <i>Women have desires too</i>.

16
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:55,517
<i>Those wifely desires are meant by God</i>
<i>to be satisfied by their husbands</i>.

17
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:59,348
- <i>Even when we may not feel like it</i>.
- <i>Like that ever happensl</i>

18
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:04,235
<i>So this is how, through marriage,</i>
<i>we create the Garden of Eden again,</i>

19
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:07,158
- <i>without shame, without sin</i>...
- <i>Amen</i>.

20
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,236
Oh, my Lord!

21
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,919
Oh, my Lord! Sweet Jesus!

22
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:15,036
Sweet Jesus!

23
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:17,548
Oh, sweet Jesus!

24
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:36,077
Those are good.

25
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:40,756
- You're up early.
- I'm always up early.

26
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:43,997
Every day's a new adventure.
Today we're having eggs.

27
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:46,031
What do you think of our new table?

28
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:50,952
- What is it, Indian?
- Persian, l think.

29
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,357
- What's the difference?
- Persia's lran and India's, well, India.

30
00:03:57,240 --> 00:04:00,437
- It's George's?
- We've been married for almost three months.

31
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:03,950
We decided it was time
to move some of his things out of storage.

32
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:09,916
Most of it's in the garage for now, but we put
the table in last night before we went to bed.

33
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:14,431
You see this? This is called a horse.

34
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:17,916
That's funny.
Where Daddy comes from, it's called a rock.

35
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:23,512
It's greywacke l found wedged in the walls
of the San Andreas Fault near Pescadero.

36
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:28,759
A "horse" is a piece of displaced rock
between the walls of a fault line.

37
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,995
That's very helpful, George, thank you.

38
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:36,068
- How's our little girl today?
- Good. Eating some eggs, wearing some.

39
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:39,157
- Is this a new table?
- It's Persian.

40
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:45,036
- Persia? Does that exist any more?
- Persia's lran. And this is a horse.

41
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:50,033
- Rock found between the walls of a fault?
- Very good, Claire.

42
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:55,949
George has told me about his rocks. Who'd
have thought they could be so fascinating?

43
00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:00,036
- Aren't they?
- It's like going to school in your own home.

44
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:04,471
You know, Claire, maybe you could take
photos of some of George's keepsakes.

45
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:08,638
- Each has such an interesting story behind it.
- Not all of them.

46
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:12,753
I mean, it's been a while
since you did any of your, you know, art.

47
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,109
I just thought it might inspire you.

48
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:18,675
- Do l look like l need to be inspired?
- Actually, you do.

49
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,516
Oh. I'm sorry.

50
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:27,348
- Don't be silly, Arthur.
- I'll just grab my cottage cheese.

51
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,391
Take it up to my room.

52
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,197
- Is this Persian?
- Yes, it is.

53
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:43,197
I'm not sure if it works in this kitchen,
but it's very beautiful.

54
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,071
Thank you.

55
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:55,637
- I think it works in this kitchen.
- I love it because it's yours.

56
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:02,639
Apparently, according to witnesses,

57
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:06,719
she just got out of her car and ran into traffic.

58
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:09,631
Do they know why?

59
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:14,634
No. I suppose we'll never know.

60
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:18,831
Well, my heart goes out to you.

61
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:26,394
It's horrible, not knowing exactly
what happened to someone you loved.

62
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:30,477
It was her time, that's all.

63
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:32,670
The Lord works in mysterious ways.

64
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,517
Yes.

65
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:37,551
He certainly does.

66
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:43,589
- Mr Sheedy, would you prefer an afternoon...
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

67
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:46,598
I think, in the interest of healthy grieving,

68
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:50,599
you need to give yourself permission
to at least be curious

69
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:55,350
as to why your wife would jump out of her car
and run into traffic.

70
00:06:56,200 --> 00:07:01,320
- For no apparent reason.
- Why? Lt's not going to bring her back.

71
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:06,354
Nate, l believe Rico could use
your assistance downstairs.

72
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,679
Right.

73
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:19,118
I'm very sorry for your loss.

74
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,913
Some of the most striking medieval tapestry art

75
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:46,999
is to be found in Central France
in the Château of Angers.

76
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:52,592
During the 14th century, a more Gothic style
would take root in England, however,

77
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:55,200
introducing intricately carved...

78
00:07:55,240 --> 00:08:00,234
You're Claire Fisher. I loved that graveyard
light-box piece you had in the alumni show.

79
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,592
Thanks.

80
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:05,598
I'm Anita Miller.
I started winter semester last year.

81
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:08,272
Cool. Hi.

82
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:11,710
..Gothic architecture, middle-period England...

83
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:17,716
Oh, God, how much of this Gothic stuff
can there be?

84
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:21,594
Some of it's really beautiful,
but it's all starting to run together in my head.

85
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:25,110
I hear that. I see one more bleeding Jesus,
l think I'll hurl.

86
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:30,393
Maybe if you hurl on a bleeding Jesus, you'll
get an independent study credit or a grant.

87
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:34,069
The NEA is just dying
to hand out money to Christ-defacers!

88
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:37,351
The NEA is dying, that's for sure.

89
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:41,198
So, are you working on anything?

90
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:46,997
No. I haven't even picked up
my camera since, like, last spring. You?

91
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:51,192
All l did was work at Starbucks
and see lame-ass movies like The Hulk.

92
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:53,629
Oh God, when l saw that l was just, like,

93
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:57,673
"Can somebody please explain
those gigunda purple fucking pants?"

94
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:01,110
I know! Just show us
his big green package already!

95
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:06,351
Can l help you?

96
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,879
Hey, you wanna go out tomorrow night?

97
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:17,391
It's open mike night at the Nuts and Jolts.
My friend Edie is doing her thing.

98
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,829
What's her thing?

99
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:23,668
It's kind of a punk-folk-poetry-performance art
kind of thing.

100
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:28,073
Sure, why not?

101
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:36,318
Can't you see he's using that
"happy she's on her way to Jesus" horseshit

102
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:39,955
to distance himself from the truth -
the man lost his wife.

103
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,232
He's facing one of the worst things
that can happen to a person

104
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:46,748
and l just think that he needs to feel.

105
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:50,395
He needs to really, really feel
the loss and the rage.

106
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:54,877
- Everyone handles grief in a different way.
- He was nowhere near actual grief.

107
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:57,514
Maybe he's keeping it together for his son.

108
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:00,950
Wouldn't want him to bump up against reality,
prepare him for life.

109
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,072
- Maybe the man has faith.
- In what, God?

110
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:08,511
Yes, in God. And maybe his faith in God
is what sustains him.

111
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:12,792
He's not sustained,
he's totally fucking checked out.

112
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:17,311
You gotta go through
all the necessary stages of grief!

113
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:21,353
That's how you honour
what the person actually meant to you.

114
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:35,917
- How long were you with the LAPD?
- Almost six years.

115
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:38,349
And why did you leave?

116
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:40,152
I...

117
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:43,272
l went off on a guy
during a domestic abuse call.

118
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:48,396
- Did you kill the guy?
- No. I busted him up pretty bad, though.

119
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:50,749
Did you ever kill anybody in the line of duty?

120
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:55,950
Once.
A guy pulled a gun and l did what l had to do.

121
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,198
- It was a clean shooting.
- I killed a guy during a domestic abuse call.

122
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:03,869
Mike, now's not the time.

123
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:10,028
Look, putting some asshole in the hospital
for beating up on his wife is not a problem.

124
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:12,071
We handle strictly high-end clientele.

125
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:16,079
Mostly high-profile people
in the music and entertainment industry.

126
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:21,319
We've handled MJ. Both MJs, actually.
Whitney, P Diddy.

127
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,157
Both MJs?

128
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:26,795
- Michael Jordan and Michael Jackson?
- Mick Jagger's an MJ.

129
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:32,150
- We've handled all three MJs, then.
- Wow.

130
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:34,589
Working for Safeguard Protection Agency,

131
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:38,428
your job is not to put your hands on anyone
during any given situation.

132
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:41,677
Your job is to low-tone it

133
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:45,156
and defuse the situation
before it becomes a situation.

134
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:49,469
- Got it.
- I've no more questions for now, Mr Charles.

135
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,560
Me neither.

136
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:56,309
- Do you have any questions for us?
- No, l don't think so.

137
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:59,830
I really would like this job, though.

138
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:04,158
I mean, it's exactly the line of work
that I'd like to get into.

139
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:08,990
I'm a hard worker and...you won't be sorry.

140
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:13,709
We'll call you.

141
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,952
OK.

142
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:19,153
Shit.

143
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:22,679
- Got any paper towels?
- We'll take care of it.

144
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:25,234
- Mike.
- I'm on it.

145
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:27,430
Sorry about that.

146
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:40,033
Thank you so much, Rico!

147
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:45,673
- Come in.
- Hi, Nicole. Hi, sweetie.

148
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:51,313
I am so glad that l met you.

149
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:59,748
I never had someone be so nice to me
without expecting something in return.

150
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:01,472
Yeah.

151
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:05,639
Except for that one time...
which l didn't mind at all.

152
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:08,831
Look, Sophia, I'm married.

153
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:13,315
I'm just trying to help out here and there.

154
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:18,309
Could you do me a huge favour? You know
that DVD player you bought me last week?

155
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:21,511
I don't know how to hook it up.

156
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:24,358
Sure. Yeah.

157
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,839
All right.

158
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:31,190
Hey, sweetie, now you can watch
all your favourite movies.

159
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:43,957
- So, you going to work?
- Yeah.

160
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:48,913
I wish you didn't have to...

161
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:51,679
you know, do that for a living.

162
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:54,359
Yeah, well, we all got to eat, right?

163
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:55,879
Yeah.

164
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:03,429
- Who watches Nicole?
- The lady upstairs.

165
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:07,871
- Where's her father?
- Fuck if l know.

166
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:11,951
Look, Rico,
he's a speed freak and a deadbeat.

167
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,798
We're better off without him, believe me.

168
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:18,549
And if you come to the club tonight,
don't call me Sophia.

169
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:22,718
- My club name is...
- Infinity. Infinity, l know.

170
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:31,075
All right, let's get this thing hooked up.
Want to help me?

171
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:34,032
Nobody knows more
about crazy people than l do.

172
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:38,915
I was raised by them, l am one of them.
I'm too old to be rubbing up strangers.

173
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:42,953
- You're gonna make an excellent therapist.
- It's an intensive programme.

174
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:48,199
I'll have to work my lazy ass off,
but I'll have my MSW summer of 2005.

175
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,231
You can analyse me.

176
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:53,590
My mother is going to freak
when she finds out.

177
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,871
I'll just never tell her.

178
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:00,436
So what day is this?

179
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:04,075
Day 78, right?

180
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:06,111
It's more like 67, actually.

181
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:08,720
67? Where do you get 67?

182
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:12,878
Those two weeks you were in San Jose
don't count. No, they don't.

183
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:17,630
- We didn't even talk during those two weeks.
- But we fantasised about each other.

184
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:20,831
- Speak for yourself.
- You didn't even think about me?

185
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:24,196
While touching myself.

186
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:28,028
- I like the sound of that.
- Yeah, l bet you do.

187
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:31,595
It's only fair that we count
the days in San Jose.

188
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:36,113
Think of it as time off for good behaviour.

189
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:39,472
Maybe.

190
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:43,791
Here, eat this.

191
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:06,678
Some people think I'm in heaven.

192
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,711
But guess what?

193
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:14,519
There is no heaven.

194
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:18,155
Except right here...with you.

195
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:31,837
Yea, though l walk through the valley
of the shadow of death, l will fear no evil

196
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:37,432
For thou art with me;
Thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me.

197
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:39,948
Oh, yeah! Oh, yes!

198
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,991
Oh, yes!

199
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:59,949
Hey, is this too much?

200
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,710
No, sir, you are all that and a box of cookies!

201
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:08,150
- You have to say that.
- Yeah, l kinda do.

202
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:11,909
Oh, shit, l gotta pick up
that package in 20 minutes.

203
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:16,549
I cannot believe you're going to be
a security guard to the stars.

204
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:20,070
- Security specialist.
- That is so hot.

205
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:23,317
- Who are you protecting today?
- I have no idea.

206
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:26,238
I have to be at The Meridien Hotel at 11.

207
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:30,193
Hope it's Russell Crowe
or Denzel Washington.

208
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:35,234
- Or Russell Crowe and Denzel Washington.
- Imagine the possibilities.

209
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:43,391
I need a new suit.

210
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:48,434
You can buy three with the money you'll make,
Mr They Start Me Out At 25 Bucks An Hour.

211
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:51,392
Some guys make 100 if they go on tour.

212
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,635
Holy shit.

213
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:58,117
We can get one of those gigantic
flat-screen TVs you've been wanting.

214
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:01,148
You know what else? A house.

215
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:06,236
- Oh, my God, with a swimming pool.
- And a Jacuzzi.

216
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:11,479
And an O'Keefe & Merritt stove and oven
for the kitchen. Put your hands on me!

217
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:16,395
My job is to not put my hands on anybody.

218
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,350
My job is to low-tone it

219
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:22,995
and defuse the situation
before it becomes a situation.

220
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:25,031
Yeah? Well, defuse this!

221
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:44,515
Keith, this is Derek and Jeffrey.

222
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,633
Hey.

223
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:49,272
What's up?

224
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:52,039
- You take a peek inside?
- Excuse me?

225
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:55,038
- Inside the case.
- No.

226
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:59,358
You didn't give me the combination.
Not that l would have if you had.

227
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:04,392
- Want to know what you were transporting?
- Not if you don't need me to.

228
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:14,835
- CD's bling.
- CD?

229
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:19,032
- Cameron Diaz.
- I'm going to meet Cameron Diaz?

230
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:23,278
No. I'm putting you on lobby duty
with Derek and Jeffrey tonight.

231
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:27,637
Got it.

232
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:41,717
- So what do we do now?
- We're doing it.

233
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:46,110
- You got some shades?
- I left them in the car.

234
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:09,235
I really like this table of yours, George.

235
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:14,154
Although l must admit,
l kind of miss the old Formica one.

236
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:20,836
Being a geologist, you'll know
it was developed as an electrical insulator,

237
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:26,159
created as a replacement for mica,
a silicate mineral.

238
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:30,239
Hence the word for-mica.

239
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:34,320
Actually, that's not true.

240
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:38,512
Mica, whether biotite or muscovite,
is a silicate mineral, that's true.

241
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:41,711
But Formica is a plastic laminate,

242
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:46,709
developed for kitchen furnishings in the 1920s.

243
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:50,719
The one has nothing whatsoever
to do with the other.

244
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:00,029
I stand corrected then.

245
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:03,231
They're both such interesting explanations,
aren't they?

246
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:13,111
By the way, that's my yogurt you're eating.
My name is clearly marked on the side of it.

247
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:17,631
I hope you're planning on replacing
however much of it you consume.

248
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:35,708
Man, I'd fuck her.

249
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,478
Me, too.

250
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:47,398
- I'd tap that ass.
- Oh, yeah. No fucking doubt.

251
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:52,557
Check out that.

252
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:58,240
You can't have that.

253
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:02,114
- I could if l wanted to.
- In your dreams, you could.

254
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:06,229
I've had finer than that.

255
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:11,351
I'd definitely tap that...

256
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,197
ass.

257
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:30,589
OK, l think you should go home.

258
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:36,829
- It's still early, though.
- I know.

259
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,871
I just want some alone time.

260
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:42,432
OK.

261
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:46,792
So when do we stop doing this
"going back to our respective places"?

262
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:51,038
- At the end of 90 days.
- 90 days, right.

263
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:54,675
A good, healthy period of rehabilitation,
that's all.

264
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:58,557
Some people go to rehab for 30 days.

265
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:01,034
Those people usually relapse.

266
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:04,675
- What about the 60-day people?
- Still pretty iffy.

267
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:10,669
OK, l see.

268
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:12,992
So...

269
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:20,397
90 days. Is it the morning of the 90th day
or is it the evening of the 90th day?

270
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:23,910
It would be the 91st, actually.

271
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:25,951
That is so not fair.

272
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:30,118
Come on. You're not 17, you can wait.

273
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:33,514
It'll be worth it, trust me.

274
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:36,552
- Just wanna see that weird tattoo.
- You've seen it.

275
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:40,036
Without all that annoying clothing
to distract me.

276
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:45,552
Just once, l want to get to know someone
before l sleep with them.

277
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:51,670
People used to get engaged
before they'd even met

278
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:54,518
and stay engaged for years
while they got to know each other.

279
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:58,997
People also used to think cats could
suck their souls out of their bodies.

280
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:01,838
They do.

281
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:04,189
You know, technically...

282
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:09,878
l could stay over before the 90 days.

283
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:12,514
We'd just have to sort of keep a lid on it.

284
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:15,154
I don't think l could do that.

285
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:24,439
OK.

286
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:35,552
I'm gonna go across the courtyard,
count to 91 and then I'll masturbate.

287
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:48,992
You want more pizza, babe?
You barely ate a thing.

288
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:51,998
No, l had two pieces, I'm full.

289
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:55,749
Usually you eat the whole pizza yourself.
Are you feeling OK?

290
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:58,394
Yeah, l feel fine.

291
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:01,637
- Can l get some more tokens?
- Yeah.

292
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:05,797
- Keeping an eye on your brother over there?
- Yes.

293
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,350
Here. One for you, one for him.

294
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:15,154
How was work?

295
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,589
Same shit, different day.

296
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:24,757
- You don't want to talk to me about anything?
- Why don't you tell me about your day?

297
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:27,189
I already did. You weren't listening.

298
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:30,710
- I was listening.
- What did l say?

299
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:39,636
Look, Vanessa. I'm just...
I'm just a little distracted right now, that's all.

300
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:42,592
It's Shakey's Pizza night. It's meant to be fun.

301
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:47,156
- The kids are having a blast.
- It's supposed to be fun for all of us.

302
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:50,636
- I'm having fun.
- You're a lying sack of shit.

303
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:55,117
You had nothing to talk about for six months.
Can l be distracted for one night?

304
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:04,430
Your clitoris.

305
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:07,153
Hot, burning, wet pinkness.

306
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:10,590
I wasn't the first and l won't be the last.

307
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:16,355
The crack of the world for all to explore,
except for me.

308
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,834
Been there, done that.

309
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:23,520
That's the end. Thank you.

310
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:32,433
- I feel violated.
- I don't think he's ever been laid.

311
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:34,471
That's Edie!

312
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:39,078
OK.

313
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:42,157
Can we make a rule for open mike night?

314
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:44,191
No more angry poems or songs

315
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:48,552
with clitoral or vaginal references in them...
unless you have one.

316
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:56,393
Here's my poem dedicated to every guy
I've ever been with.

317
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:02,394
Your penis is kinda nice.

318
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:04,431
Too bad you're attached to it.

319
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:12,753
This next piece is a collaboration between
me and my mom, who lives in Chicago.

320
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:23,517
My mom has cancer and she's really angry,

321
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:28,111
even though she's been smoking
three packs a day for 40 years.

322
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:31,072
- <i>Edie</i>...
- Feel sorry for her yet?

323
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:37,430
<i>I just came back from lunch</i>
<i>with your Aunt Betty</i>.

324
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:41,871
Aunt Betty, who once told me
black people couldn't go to heaven.

325
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:46,990
<i>I feel so lost,</i>

326
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:51,033
<i>l don't know what to do with myself</i>.

327
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:58,873
OK, l lied about the cancer part. There's
nothing wrong with this woman. Nothing.

328
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:02,629
<i>What happened to me, Edie?</i>
<i>What happened to my life?</i>

329
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:05,877
She's a fucking victim
who's never taken a chance in her life

330
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:09,435
and has nobody to blame but herself.

331
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:13,677
<i>I wish l was dead</i>.

332
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:19,272
Actually, my mom is the Vice President of
the Midwestern Direct Marketing Association.

333
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:23,233
<i>I can get you any targeted list you want</i>.
<i>Over 65, under 21,</i>

334
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:27,478
<i>married, single, gay, lesbian, smokers,</i>
<i>racists, cancer survivors</i>.

335
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:31,672
She's plunging headlong into the abyss
with all her guns firing!

336
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:35,918
<i>You just tell me what you want</i>
<i>and l will deliverl</i>

337
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:42,593
lt will take you 32 hours of physical agony
and you will never let me forget about it!

338
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:45,592
<i>Edie</i>.

339
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:14,637
You made her look so beautiful.

340
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:19,315
Well, you and God.

341
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:22,076
That's our job.

342
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:26,989
Me and my associates, l mean.
Not me and God.

343
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:32,675
So how are you holding up?

344
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:35,314
Quite well. Thank you for asking.

345
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:39,555
- It's OK for you to be angry.
- I'm not angry.

346
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:44,958
Maybe you don't realise it. Anger is a natural
and necessary stage in the grieving process.

347
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:48,231
- Nate...
- You can't just skip over it. I've been there.

348
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:53,834
You have to live with it and allow yourself
to dwell on it. You have to own it.

349
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:57,589
Only then can you move through it
and get on with the rest of your life.

350
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:02,479
I know there's a reason
God chose this for Dorothy

351
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:05,398
and l know that His wisdom is infinite.

352
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:08,750
- What if you're wrong?
- I'm not.

353
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:12,392
- What if there is no God, no heaven?
- Nate...

354
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:17,560
What if she's gone forever, like she didn't
exist? Your child will never know his mother.

355
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:21,195
- That doesn't make you angry?
- It's all right.

356
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:24,357
No, it's not. If you'll excuse us for a moment.

357
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:26,992
Please.

358
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:36,198
- That's enough.
- I am just trying to help the guy face the truth.

359
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:41,030
I'm qualified. I'm a funeral director, my wife is
freshly fucking dead. Who's more qualified?

360
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:46,393
- This isn't about you. Leave them alone.
- You want to leave them alone? Fine.

361
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:52,037
But don't expect me to feed them lame shit
like it's gonna get better because it won't!

362
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:58,355
Well, maybe some people
aren't ready for that.

363
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:05,191
"Formica:

364
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:09,677
"A durable plastic laminate
used in kitchen furnishings,

365
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:13,076
"developed as an electrical insulator

366
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:18,319
"as a replacement
for the silicate mineral...mica."

367
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:25,631
- That was so great.
- No, it was self-indulgent.

368
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:28,148
I still don't know exactly what it's about,

369
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:33,035
but l figure, do the work,
stay out of the results.

370
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:37,119
I liked the cock poem at the beginning.
Totally improvised, right?

371
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:40,357
- Was l too hard on him?
- No, not at all.

372
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:44,075
- He was weeping...
- But two cute girls followed him out back.

373
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:46,076
Maybe he'll get a blow job out of it.

374
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:51,038
- So you're at LAC Arts, right?
- Yeah.

375
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:53,913
- What year?
- Sophomore. You?

376
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:56,110
Junior, l think.

377
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:59,357
I haven't been keeping track of my credits
or anything.

378
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:03,313
- Claire grew up in a funeral home.
- Why did you have to tell her that?

379
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:07,239
- What's your medium?
- Photography mostly.

380
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:12,630
- But l haven't picked up my camera in months.
- Why not?

381
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:16,150
I don't know.
I went through a tough time for a while.

382
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:18,236
That's the best time to work.

383
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:22,353
Your guts are all raw and you don't
waste too much time thinking about it.

384
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:24,868
I just feel like anything l do will be shit.

385
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:29,471
So? What's the worst that can happen?
Some asshole will make fun of you?

386
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:32,239
- Like you made fun of poet guy?
- Yeah, exactly.

387
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:36,068
I'm sure there are plenty of people here
right now making fun of me.

388
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:41,717
- I guess I'm just waiting for the right time.
- Well, none of us may be here tomorrow.

389
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:44,593
You of all people should know that, right?

390
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:03,391
Are you OK?

391
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:11,877
Ever since Lisa died, every death that comes
through here feels like her dying all over again.

392
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:20,515
- It's only been a few months, Nate.
- Yeah.

393
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:26,039
I keep thinking it's going to get easier.

394
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:31,311
- No one ever said it gets easy.
- Not easy, easier.

395
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:34,751
Just for five fucking minutes.

396
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:43,677
I can't get it out of my head even for that long.

397
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:47,669
Even when I'm with Maya.

398
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:59,472
Most of all,
l just don't believe any of this any more.

399
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:03,718
- Any of what?
- That anything we say or do helps anybody.

400
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:12,830
- All right, look...
- l can't do this any more, David.

401
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:17,838
- What are you saying?
- I'm saying that l quit.

402
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:21,793
- You're quitting?
- I'm not cut out for this.

403
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:26,038
You're cut out for this. Dad was. Rico is.
Probably Arthur's cut out for this.

404
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:29,470
I'm not. I'm not. I am not cut out for this.

405
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:36,234
And l have got to find some other kind
of life for myself. And for Maya, too.

406
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:39,517
I have to.

407
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:44,278
I'm sorry.

408
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:13,910
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Is that you making all that noise?

409
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:15,439
<i>What noise?</i>

410
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:20,508
Sounds kind of like a moose
that got hit by a Mack truck.

411
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:23,757
<i>I beg your pardon, I'm orgasming</i>.

412
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:28,396
You might want to dial it back a bit
before the landlady calls animal control.

413
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:31,432
<i>Can't help it</i>.
<i>Fantasising about making love to you</i>

414
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:35,359
<i>is even better than actual sex</i>
<i>with most people</i>.

415
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:38,392
- What are you wearing?
- <i>At the moment?</i>

416
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:40,032
<i>Nothing</i>.

417
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:44,151
- Come over in that.
- <i>You're joking, right?</i>

418
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:48,239
Maybe not, but come now
before l change my mind.

419
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:07,517
- Did anyone see you come over?
- I hope so.

420
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:09,551
Get in here.

421
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:16,911
Well...the balI's in your court, so to speak.

422
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:36,671
Is everything all right, David?

423
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:40,508
As a matter of fact, no,
everything is not all right. Nate quit.

424
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:43,154
- What do you mean, he quit?
- His job.

425
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:46,317
- When?
- Last night.

426
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:50,148
It's now Fisher & Diaz
as in one Fisher and one Diaz.

427
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:53,397
Well, you've been complaining
about Nate's work.

428
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:58,150
- I'd think you'd be happy if he took a break.
- Mom, he's not taking a break, he quit.

429
00:36:58,200 --> 00:36:59,997
Now there are just two of us.

430
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:04,033
I already had to drop out of chorus
since he's almost never here.

431
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:06,674
Perhaps this is for the best, then.

432
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:09,951
I suppose we can get Arthur
to pick up some of the slack.

433
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:13,072
He can embalm
as long as one of us is in the room with him.

434
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:18,797
The average American changes career
seven times during his or her lifetime.

435
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:23,630
Is that information supposed to be useful
in some way, George?

436
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:25,352
It's just a fact.

437
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:53,194
- Hey, I'm gonna take Maya to the park.
- OK, l know. Have fun at the park.

438
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:56,038
I'll be here at work, keeping us all afloat.

439
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:31,274
Dorothy loved all of you and l know that
she'll watch down on us as we sleep.

440
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:39,318
But know that she is not gone
and anyone who knows Dorothy knows it.

441
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:43,233
- Hey, why are you...
- <i>Hey, dum-dum</i>.

442
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:50,952
I just got home and l was thinking about
how sweet you are. And l miss you.

443
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:55,312
Yeah. Hey, look, I'm at work right now.
I shouldn't even be...

444
00:38:55,360 --> 00:39:00,434
l was thinking maybe you could
come over later, OK? Please?

445
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:03,312
OK.

446
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:09,038
Maybe l can stop by for, like, a little while.

447
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:11,799
<i>OK. Pick us up something to eat, too</i>.

448
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:14,400
- Some...
- <i>Nicole loves pizza with pepperoni</i>.

449
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:17,273
We can eat it together and watch TV.
It'll be fun.

450
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:22,396
I can do that. I'll be there in a little bit.

451
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:24,954
OK, hurry. I can't wait.

452
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:37,071
Vanessa's just called.

453
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:41,557
Augusto has an ear infection
and she needs me to take him to the doctor.

454
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:44,831
OK, fine, go.

455
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:08,149
- Shit!
- It just started, then it wouldn't stop.

456
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:12,796
- Jesus fucking Christ.
- All the blood's backed up into the plumbing.

457
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:17,994
After we spent $38,000 for a whole new system
less than two years ago?

458
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:21,749
- Should l call the plumber?
- Yes, tell him it's an emergency!

459
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:25,190
And don't let anybody use the bathroom!

460
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:29,472
- This is so fucking gross.
- What the fuck do you think you're doing?

461
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:32,353
Taking pictures.
This is right out of The Shining.

462
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:34,789
This is not cool or legal. Stop it!

463
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:39,588
- What bug crawled up your ass?
- This is our family business.

464
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:43,394
Even if I'm the only one of the family
who gives a shit any more.

465
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:46,637
What if you need photos
for the insurance company?

466
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:51,919
All right, take some more,
but this is not an art project.

467
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:56,871
OK, here we go.

468
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:01,791
Good job.

469
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:05,630
All right, all right. Good job.

470
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:32,033
Whoever did your last job cut some corners by
using PVC instead of copper. That's not good.

471
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:34,913
Then your drainage line busted and backed up
into your septic.

472
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:37,997
Once that happened,
everything went to hell from there.

473
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:43,831
But l replaced all your busted PVC
with copper and you should be OK.

474
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:49,512
I just need you to initial here, here,
and sign here.

475
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:59,039
- Thanks for coming so quickly.
- Hey, that's...

476
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,991
That's what I'm here for.

477
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:17,872
- Something wrong?
- No.

478
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:21,833
- I'm doing something wrong.
- No, not at all.

479
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:24,314
- Am I?
- Not at all.

480
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:30,959
- It's a little weird, isn't it?
- It's always weird in the beginning.

481
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:34,473
Is this more weird or less weird?

482
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:38,115
- You want me to compare?
- No. I mean, yes.

483
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:42,631
I do, kind of.
Only if it's a favourable comparison.

484
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:44,955
- This is fine.
- Good.

485
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,468
- Is it good for you?
- Yes, definitely.

486
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:49,875
Good, I'm glad.

487
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:53,952
- I think we're talking too much.
- Yes.

488
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:57,993
- I really like you, Brenda.
- We're definitely talking too much.

489
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:19,474
You do have a lot of hair in your ears.

490
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:22,910
I have no idea why,
from an evolutionary perspective,

491
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:25,997
Homo sapiens get hairier the older they get.

492
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:30,431
You have such an interesting way
of looking at the world, George.

493
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:35,270
Ruth, l have the feeling that your children
don't care all that much for me.

494
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:40,917
That's not true.
Well, perhaps you try a bit too hard with them.

495
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:45,511
I'm just trying to have a relationship
with them, that's all.

496
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:51,032
I hate to say this, but I'm finding your family
a little difficult to connect with.

497
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:53,674
Turn your head, please.

498
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:57,918
Well, maybe you're right.
Maybe if l didn't try so hard.

499
00:43:57,960 --> 00:44:00,633
I love you just the way you are.

500
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:05,390
And sooner or later, everyone else
in this family will love you, too.

501
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:12,995
I quit my job.

502
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:15,600
I quit my whole fucking life.

503
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:20,111
- You didn't quit, you got fired.
- I guess maybe l did, yeah.

504
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:23,869
Not the best thing that ever happened to me,
but it was right up there.

505
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:27,754
Getting married, becoming a father,
getting creamed by a bus,

506
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:30,633
those are some of life's big moments.

507
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:37,190
- You were never cut out for this business.
- That's what I've been thinking.

508
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:43,070
- It's all a bunch of bullshit, right?
- Sometimes yes, sometimes no.

509
00:44:43,120 --> 00:44:49,070
Sometimes I'd even surprise myself at how
heartfelt I'd find myself in a given situation

510
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:55,309
and then sometimes you'd just say the words
and hope nobody realises you're full of crap.

511
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:57,555
Happens to the best of us.

512
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:01,155
But you're probably better off.

513
00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:12,989
I'd give anything if Lisa hadn't died.

514
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:19,590
Then again, when she was here,
l just wanted to be free.

515
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:28,754
- You coming inside?
- No.

516
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:30,597
Not today.

517
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:35,918
This one...well, she's a keeper.

518
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:39,350
- Yeah, isn't she?
- Whatever you do, don't fuck that up.

519
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:42,919
You take care of yourself, buddy boy.

520
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:55,715
Well, what do we have here?

521
00:45:59,320 --> 00:46:01,151
Come on.

522
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:06,228
- You still haven't even seen Cameron Diaz?
- It's only been two days. She's very private.

523
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:10,273
- Apparently so.
- It's a glamorous job, what can l say?

524
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:16,115
- Do you like the guys you're working with?
- They're OK.

525
00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:23,711
I got a blow job today.

526
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:27,236
You did not.

527
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:32,111
I did.

528
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:39,151
- From who?
- From the plumber.

529
00:46:41,320 --> 00:46:45,154
- You got a blow job from a plumber?
- His name was Andy.

530
00:46:47,720 --> 00:46:52,271
- A white guy?
- Yeah. He was good with the wrench.

531
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:58,037
- Did you return the favour?
- No.

532
00:47:05,320 --> 00:47:09,632
You better not think you're getting out
of having sex with me tonight.

533
00:47:11,320 --> 00:47:16,110
OK, but l might need you to talk about
water rams and hand snakes.

534
00:47:21,720 --> 00:47:25,918
- Might it be a late wedding present?
- There's no return address.

535
00:47:35,840 --> 00:47:38,274
What is it?

536
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:42,040
- I believe it's faeces.
- Faeces?

537
00:47:43,120 --> 00:47:47,432
Who in the world would send you faeces
in the mail?

538
00:47:47,480 --> 00:47:49,630
- I don't know.
- Look at this, Maya.

539
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:53,389
Somebody sent Grandpa
a big steaming pile of dookie.

540
00:47:55,400 --> 00:47:58,597
Wait, don't throw it away
before l can get my camera.

541
00:49:13,240 --> 00:49:14,229
