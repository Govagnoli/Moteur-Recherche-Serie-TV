1
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:49,637
You stupid, stupid son of a bitch!

2
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:54,112
You've got three beautiful girls

3
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:56,674
and they are never gonna be
able to take a drink!

4
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:01,555
They are never gonna
be able to have cocktail hour.

5
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,352
You wanna know why?

6
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,960
- Suzanne, take it easy.
- You wanna know why?

7
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,389
Because you are a fucking alcoholic.

8
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:10,431
- Suzanne.
- What?!

9
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,591
Should we get some help?

10
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,190
What? What's up?

11
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:33,913
I just do not want to go to fucking ldaho.

12
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:37,396
Oh, don't drive yourself crazy over it.

13
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,874
I just don't want to go.

14
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:44,232
You told them you were coming,
you were gonna go, so just go.

15
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:49,035
You know, I'd be fine if it was just
the dedication of Lisa's ashes...

16
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:52,997
- But?
- I don't wanna be with the Kimmels.

17
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:59,950
And I really don't wanna put Maya
in that situation.

18
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,394
Death, death, death.
I'm done looking backward,

19
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:06,796
I just wanna look forward,
with you, with us.

20
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:09,354
- You do?
- Yeah, I do.

21
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:21,829
What are you doing, little monkey?

22
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:26,150
Honey, half these boxes
are full of Lisa's clothes.

23
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:29,715
Yeah, I saved them for Maya
so she can see them when grows up.

24
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:34,276
Well, when you think about it,
this ceremony does the same thing.

25
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:39,952
You wanna go so that when Maya grows up
you can say to her, "You were there."

26
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:46,116
- I have colitis.
- Oh, no.

27
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:48,674
Yup. I do.

28
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:51,154
There it is, colitis.

29
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:54,954
Fuckin' Jesus, Mom!
You're a seven-letter whore.

30
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,797
And it's on the triple word.

31
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:00,071
It's all about the seven letters for her.
It always has been.

32
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:03,032
She skips three turns
then mashes the shit out of you.

33
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:05,389
- I'm your biggest problem.
- You are.

34
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:08,113
- You. You.
- You!

35
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:10,355
- I quit.
- The hell you do.

36
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:13,356
I'm going to miss this.

37
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:17,639
- I don't wanna go home.
- Play the game.

38
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:25,119
Is...

39
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:28,639
- umurawi a word?
- What?

40
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,750
It's all I've got. Umurawi.

41
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,318
Fisher.

42
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:45,751
Coming!

43
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:52,071
- Sorry, were you sleeping?
- No, but we were in bed.

44
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:56,352
The people are coming,
the people are coming, the people, the people!

45
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,153
- What time is it?
- It's Miller time.

46
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:03,755
- Hey, whore.
- Hey, whore.

47
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:08,033
Dude, come on,
help me bring this over here.

48
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:13,119
- Where do you want it?
- Over there.

49
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:16,436
Guess Jimmy's the refrigerator magnet
of the week again?

50
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:18,550
I get dizzy trying to keep up.

51
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:23,800
I get it, cos you and Russell are like
Mr and Mrs Happy Suburban Love Couple?

52
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,231
Maybe we are.

53
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:30,511
Maybe we're gonna buy
a ranch house in a cul-de-sac.

54
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,275
- Did you bring weed?
- Yeah.

55
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:38,312
Hey, sweetie?
Did we bring my CDs in?

56
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:40,271
I got 'em, Baboo.

57
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:46,238
- Get out of my shit.
- You said you brought pot.

58
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:49,636
- I could get it for you, Stonehenge.
- Get it then.

59
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:04,878
I want a lot of flowers. I mean it, a lot.

60
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:08,549
I don't want it to look like,
you know, like...

61
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:12,229
like I didn't care because I do.

62
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:14,748
More than they'll ever know.

63
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,791
More than anyone.

64
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:18,398
Of course.

65
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:22,432
Rob liked lisianthus.

66
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:24,516
Didn't he, honey?

67
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:29,674
They're sort of halfway
between tulips and roses

68
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:33,395
except they have no thorns
and they're usually purple or white.

69
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:37,632
- They sound beautiful.
- Yeah, they are.

70
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,477
We'll take purple.

71
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,753
Shit!

72
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,592
OK, so, you...

73
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:54,918
What? You'll put him out there?
And then what?

74
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:58,236
- You could say a few words if you want.
- Oh, God.

75
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,389
"Hi, I'm Suzanne Wething.

76
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:08,436
"Some of you may have seen me kicking Rob
in the parking lot at Jen's wedding.

77
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:11,677
"Actually, he was already dead
from alcohol poisoning

78
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:14,917
"so you can just all stop
looking at me like that."

79
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,677
I don't think so.

80
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,236
What? It's no secret.

81
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:30,471
Paige knows. Your sisters know, don't they?

82
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,551
Daddy was a drunk.

83
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,790
What is it again? Waterbury what?

84
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:52,073
"Waterford W Collection
11-inch spire stem vase."

85
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:56,113
- Terry doesn't fuck around.
- No, when he registers, he registers.

86
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,798
Maybe we should get married.

87
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:00,877
So we can have people going on
vase-buying errands for us?

88
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:05,311
No. So, we can say all those
"forevers" and "no matter whats".

89
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:08,909
You're in my will, I'm in yours,
we basically are married,

90
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,520
even if the law refuses to recognise it.

91
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:15,348
But I refuse to recognise the Bush
administration so I guess it evens out.

92
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:18,836
Just some sort of ceremony
in front of family and friends

93
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:20,518
would make it more real.

94
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:23,916
I don't think now's the time
to go into event-planning mode.

95
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:27,316
- Why?
- All the shit you've been through lately.

96
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:30,079
I just don't think it's the perfect time.

97
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:34,796
It never is. Sometimes you just have to
pick a moment and do it, right?

98
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:38,230
Like Nate moving in with Brenda
and taking Maya with him?

99
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:41,033
- If you ask me, that's crazy.
- You think?

100
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:43,196
Well, fast.

101
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:46,391
Life's so short.
I don't know what fast is any more.

102
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:48,431
Here it is.

103
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:54,718
$225? They're not getting this from us.

104
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:57,149
Yes, they are, just bite the bullet.

105
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,955
Right here, a garlic press for 30 bucks.

106
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,639
You want to be the guys
who gave them the garlic press?

107
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:09,719
They'll use a garlic press
way more than they'll use a $225 vase.

108
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,352
No.

109
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,558
Jesus.

110
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,751
I'm home.

111
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:03,310
- Hello?
- Hi, I wanna see my kids.

112
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,634
- <i>When?</i>
- Today.

113
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:07,478
- What time?
- <i>Five. No, wait</i>.

114
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:08,953
Shit.

115
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:14,111
Let me drive them to karate tomorrow
and then I'll take them to lunch.

116
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:17,755
You can't, we carpool with the Koehlers.
It messes everything up.

117
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:20,792
Vanessa, you can't keep me
from seeing my kids.

118
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:24,753
I'm not trying to keep you
from seeing your kids.

119
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:28,395
Why don't you come over tomorrow
and play with them?

120
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:33,833
- At the house?
- Yes, that would be better.

121
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:40,394
I'll be there at two.
So, like, from two to four?

122
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:44,792
Make it three to five
just to make sure we're back.

123
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:47,835
OK, see you then.

124
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,798
And I was...

125
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:59,669
hauling this box of meteorites
out to the car and I...

126
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:01,790
I thought,

127
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:04,559
"Jesus, God,

128
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:08,832
"look at yourself moving
these goddamn rocks again.

129
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:12,556
"How many times are you gonna do this?"

130
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:17,793
We're supposed to stay together
because you don't wanna move your rocks?

131
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,558
No.

132
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:23,716
We should stay together
because we love each other.

133
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,396
I love you, anyway.

134
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,949
I do.

135
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,991
I love you too, George.

136
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:37,797
But this is my thought here,

137
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:40,434
if you're going to be my husband

138
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,835
and I'm gonna be your wife,

139
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:46,316
it will have to be, it can only be,

140
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:48,191
if some conditions are met.

141
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:52,352
Shoot.

142
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:57,517
Mainly, that you behave like a husband.

143
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:01,400
And to me that means sharing yourself.

144
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:05,317
I don't wanna have to feel bad
every time I ask you a question.

145
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:12,109
- All right.
- And I want a healthy,

146
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:15,550
continuous flow of family around here.

147
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,273
Like making a space for Kyle and Becky.

148
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:23,797
- Becky?
- My friend from the fabric shop.

149
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:26,115
I set them up.

150
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:30,751
- Don't be mad.
- I'm not mad.

151
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:35,275
Not to mention your other children,
Brian and Maggie.

152
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:37,356
I haven't even met them yet.

153
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:41,715
All right, you'll meet them.

154
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:46,629
And I need to feel like
you like me again.

155
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,756
You're my favourite person.

156
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,633
You don't make me feel like
your favourite person.

157
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,079
Look...

158
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:02,512
I'll try.

159
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:05,238
I will, I mean it.

160
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:08,078
I'll...

161
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:10,912
I'll try.

162
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:20,911
You poor thing.

163
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:29,474
Yes, we'll be at the Black Forest Inn.

164
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:31,829
Yeah.

165
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:34,314
11:10 in the morning.

166
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:36,078
Yeah.

167
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:39,873
No, 1170 is our flight number.

168
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,911
How could we land at 11:70?

169
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:47,992
Yeah, I was kidding too.
All right, thanks. Bye.

170
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:50,838
- Secret, you could write...
- The guy is such a knob.

171
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:53,110
I'll take you guys to the airport.

172
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:55,390
- You know what?
- Orange.

173
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,954
I've got a better idea,
why don't you come with us?

174
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,956
No, I don't think so.

175
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,958
You don't have to come to the ceremony.
Just come to ldaho.

176
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,230
I really think I'd be in the way.

177
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:09,319
Well, I really think it would actually make
the whole thing liveable for me,

178
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,396
having it be the three of us.

179
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:16,109
- You really want me to come?
- I asked you, didn't I?

180
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,917
Come on.

181
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,436
Byron. I can't.
I have an appointment with Byron tomorrow.

182
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:28,119
I think Byron will be fine
if he misses a session.

183
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:31,118
- You've only been seeing him for a month.
- Exactly.

184
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:34,675
It's too soon to leave him by himself
in the middle of reality.

185
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,950
What about my reality?

186
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:07,672
- Come dance with me.
- This should be illegal.

187
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:10,439
- What?
- This should be illegal!

188
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:14,792
- What should be illegal?
- People trying to get other people to dance.

189
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:23,038
You're right.

190
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:35,352
- What the fuck, Claire!
- What?

191
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:37,391
What are you doing?

192
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,078
I just...

193
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:44,112
You just look so fucking beautiful tonight.

194
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:47,391
Do I? Wow, that must make it
so hard for everybody.

195
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,556
High much?

196
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:53,555
Why are you being such a fucking bitch?

197
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:57,559
The world's not your own private
fucking chemistry set, Claire.

198
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:02,392
Just stay away from me.
Leave me the fuck alone.

199
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,352
Yeah. Thanks.

200
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:45,470
No, I already have the number.

201
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:46,953
Thanks.

202
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:55,037
Barb called, left a message. There's some
barbecue at Peg and Ed's in an hour.

203
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:58,231
I should have told them
I was coming tomorrow morning.

204
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:00,475
They want you to go over now?

205
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:04,071
Like in an hour.

206
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:08,078
I'm just gonna call and say I can't make it.

207
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:14,757
- No, I'll get it.
- I was gonna pass it to you.

208
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:17,678
Just... You know,
I'll just let them leave a message.

209
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:19,711
Answer it. I'll be quiet!

210
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:25,313
- I'm just gonna check the message.
- Whatever.

211
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:28,795
You should go to the barbecue.

212
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:33,957
- Yeah, I don't know.
- They just wanna see Maya.

213
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,760
I'll be all right. I got a bunch of work to do.

214
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:46,114
Hi, do you have a message for room 13?

215
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:52,157
It's for you.

216
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:57,038
Hello?

217
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:03,470
No. But I know how to spell it.

218
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:06,396
Just the number.

219
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:12,073
Thank you.

220
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:19,319
Byron.

221
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:24,069
Now, Terry, repeat after me.

222
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:27,312
I, Terry, take you, Paul.

223
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:30,355
I, Terry, take you, Paul...

224
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:33,756
To be my lifetime partner, lover and friend.

225
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:37,031
To be my lifetime partner,
lover and friend...

226
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,796
Cut it out.

227
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,831
- Cut it out.
- I'm sorry.

228
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:44,430
Don't get me started.

229
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:46,471
In sickness and in health.

230
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:48,957
In sickness and in health...

231
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,753
In times of plenty and times of want.

232
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:54,633
In times of plenty
and times of want.

233
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:56,716
Until death do us part.

234
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:23,033
God, you scared the living crap out of me!

235
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:27,308
What are you doing here?

236
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,669
Anita and I crashed here.

237
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:32,188
She left early this morning.

238
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:37,359
But I fell into a K-hole last night

239
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:42,270
and I'm climbing out right now.

240
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,836
Who had K last night?

241
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:47,078
I don't know.

242
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:51,431
- How was it, fun?
- I don't know.

243
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:54,392
I might have been raped
and I'll only recover the memory

244
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:56,874
under intense hypnosis ten years from now.

245
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:58,911
That's cool.

246
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,391
Mom?

247
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,635
- Tender.
- I can't find it.

248
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:08,353
- Did you look in the garage?
- Excuse me?

249
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,476
This meat is so tender.

250
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:15,994
- I think we got the marinade right, Ed.
- It's great.

251
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:24,952
Was it hard for you and Maya
to find the time to get away?

252
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:27,954
You didn't have anything else going on?

253
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,150
Nothing as important as this.

254
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:35,916
It's been hard lately.

255
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:40,593
You think you finally get to
the bottom of the feelings

256
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,676
and then there are more.

257
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,073
Yeah.

258
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:51,394
OK, Byron, just tell me what's going on.

259
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:55,399
- <i>I'm on a bridge</i>.
- Where?

260
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:58,876
<i>Los Feliz. I'm sitting on a ledge</i>.

261
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:01,718
Byron, you need to get down
off that ledge right now.

262
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:04,670
There are so many cars

263
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:11,713
and each one of them
has someone inside driving.

264
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:16,993
<i>And all those people, they all feel things</i>
<i>every bit as deeply as you and I do</i>.

265
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:20,439
Byron, I want you to do something for me.

266
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,596
I'd like you to do something for me, too.

267
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,631
I'd like you to honour your commitments

268
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:27,240
but that's not something
you think you should do.

269
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:29,874
I'm sorry, I had a family matter come up.

270
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:33,799
- I needed to attend to it.
- <i>Are you married?</i>

271
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:37,628
That's not really relevant to the work
we're doing together.

272
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:40,956
Was it something really important
or did you just blow me off?

273
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,831
<i>I rescheduled with you. I left</i>...

274
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:45,792
You left a message telling me
when you would be available!

275
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:48,832
- <i>In an emergency</i>...
- I am having an emergency!

276
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:51,440
Byron, please get off the bridge.

277
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:55,395
You're the one who wanted me
to cross the bridge!

278
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:58,273
Yes, and now I'd like you to get off the bridge

279
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:01,278
so that we can continue
our work together, OK?

280
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,550
Our work together is important.

281
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:09,438
I'm not on a bridge.

282
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,755
Where are you?

283
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,791
<i>I am in my living room</i>.

284
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:17,638
Why can I hear traffic?

285
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:19,796
<i>It's just my air conditioner</i>.

286
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:27,391
See? I was just pretending.

287
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:37,313
Byron, that was very dishonest of you.

288
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:43,118
If you do anything like that ever again,
I'll have to stop seeing you,

289
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:45,355
do you understand?

290
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:48,073
- <i>Do you understand?</i>
- Yes.

291
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:51,237
Good, I'm gonna hang up now.

292
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:53,271
OK, goodbye.

293
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:03,596
Say cheese, Maya.

294
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:06,712
That was a good one, good job!

295
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:10,114
Kick it back. Can you kick it back?

296
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:13,516
Uncle Nate, did you ever give David Stiff?

297
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:16,835
- What?
- The book I gave you to give to him

298
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,711
when we took Maya to Legoland?

299
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:22,629
Oh, yeah. I didn't, I'm sorry.

300
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:24,716
I completely spaced.

301
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:26,671
But...

302
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:32,030
but you know,
I can see right where it is in my head

303
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:33,911
so when I get back, I'll give it to him.

304
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:36,315
You could read it, too. It's very informative.

305
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,150
Maybe I'll do that.

306
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:57,720
- You look tired.
- I am.

307
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:01,309
If you want to go back to the inn,
Maya can play with the kids.

308
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:04,158
Hoyt said something about
roasting marshmallows.

309
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:08,716
- Careful, you guys.
- Dad, we're just havin' fun, aren't we?

310
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:16,232
Why don't you go back and get some
alone-time and we'll bring Maya back?

311
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:22,516
We're, like, five minutes from Main Street.
She'll be fine. It's family.

312
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,638
All right.

313
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:29,357
Just give me a call
when you pull up outside.

314
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:31,675
- Sure.
- Look at the camera, Maya.

315
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:34,280
Look at me and give me a big smile.

316
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:35,594
Yeah!

317
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:43,436
Man, you won again!

318
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:46,476
You should go on the pro tour, buddy.

319
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:59,718
- Look at you.
- Yeah.

320
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:07,234
- Julio finished all of his homework.
- That's good.

321
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:14,632
- Who's coming over?
- You remember Kenny Simms?

322
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:17,990
- From high school?
- Hi. Come on in.

323
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:20,512
- How are you?
- I'm great.

324
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:22,312
- You look great.
- Thank you.

325
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:33,594
Am I... I'm not early, am I?

326
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:35,312
No.

327
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:40,913
Well, I guess I'll go.

328
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:47,591
All right, guys.

329
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:50,351
See you soon.

330
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:53,350
- Bye, Daddy.
- Bye.

331
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:12,635
I'm sorry if I came at a bad time.

332
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:15,717
No, you didn't do anything, no.

333
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:18,035
- It's all good.
- OK.

334
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:25,034
Your little boy is so cute.

335
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:26,593
Thanks.

336
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:30,873
- Is he...
- Adopted?

337
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:34,071
Yeah, about a year and a half ago,
from Guatemala.

338
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:36,475
My partner and I have
had, like, you know,

339
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:40,479
the most preliminary of
adoption conversations.

340
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:43,876
- Which agency did you use?
- Whole Family Center.

341
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:47,833
They're good people and they've got strong
connections in Guatemala

342
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:50,394
with the bureaucracy, which is great.

343
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:54,115
But they're kind of religious,
if you know what I mean?

344
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:55,513
I think so.

345
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:58,393
They don't work with gay couples so...

346
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:02,755
You might wanna try Rainbow Kids
or some place like that.

347
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,675
- Thanks for the tip.
- Sure.

348
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,391
You came back!

349
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:22,518
Where's Maya?

350
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:25,757
She's playing with her cousins
for a couple hours.

351
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:27,597
Miss me?

352
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:32,634
No, I was too busy having
a totally surreal phone session with my client.

353
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:34,671
Yeah, what happened?

354
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:37,829
I can't tell you, you know that.

355
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:40,269
Come on, how much do I unload on you

356
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:42,993
about the freaky people
I deal with at work?

357
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:45,270
- This is different.
- Not really.

358
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:46,992
Yeah, really.

359
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:52,873
Yeah, this is the whole, you know,
client-privilege doctor thing.

360
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:55,309
- Yeah.
- It's very professional.

361
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:58,750
How do I know
this client exists anyway?

362
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:02,759
How do I know this isn't some hot guy
you've got on the side?

363
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:08,875
- I was kidding.
- I know.

364
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:11,275
- I'm not really worried...
- I know.

365
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:14,039
I wouldn't have moved in if I was worried.

366
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:25,390
You know, this is...

367
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:29,515
like the first time we've been together.

368
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:31,198
What do you mean?

369
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:34,949
The other times,
we never really had a relationship.

370
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:38,356
One of us was always escaping or lying...

371
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:41,039
- Or stoned.
- Or something.

372
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:43,036
Yeah.

373
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:45,071
Now, we're really here.

374
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:53,313
I drove back here to tell you I love you,
that I miss you

375
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:56,637
and...

376
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:00,635
To make sure I didn't escape?

377
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:02,193
Oh, yeah.

378
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:16,591
This one's cool.

379
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:22,749
- If you like nostrils.
- Claire.

380
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:28,396
No, I can't have this kind of documentation
of my nose just lying around.

381
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:32,875
Maybe if I just rip out my nose.

382
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:41,115
There. That's better.

383
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:49,316
- Nostrilly goodness.
- Stop.

384
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:53,394
You're an idiot. Stop, stop it.

385
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:09,473
I'm so much happier when I'm high.

386
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:30,670
I got your eyes.

387
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:48,435
That's so scary.
I wish you could see this.

388
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:51,233
Well, get my camera.
It's right over there.

389
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:56,512
- How's the light in here?
- Good, we're good.

390
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:05,033
Yeah.

391
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:08,311
If you pucker up.

392
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:10,032
Yeah.

393
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:14,113
The problem is not nuclear war.

394
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:17,038
The problem is
what's gonna cause nuclear war.

395
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:19,958
I don't see us living through
a nuclear war, George.

396
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,639
Of course not.
Not a whole lot of people will.

397
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:25,433
I mean, in our lifetime.
I don't see it happening.

398
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:29,478
I married the glass-is-half-full girl.

399
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:31,397
Which time?

400
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:34,830
This time. Of course, yes.
What was I thinking?

401
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:38,671
This decaf is so cinnamony.

402
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:40,312
Isn't it?

403
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:44,953
I think when the next A-bomb is launched,
it'll be over God.

404
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:48,397
- Whose?
- Exactly.

405
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:51,910
The fundamentalists,
lslamic, Christian and otherwise

406
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:56,272
will all conspire to end the world the way
their holy books said it would -

407
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:58,038
with a big war.

408
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:02,232
But all those theologies have a message
of hope and brotherly love too,

409
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:06,353
to counterbalance the irresistible force
of self-fulfilling prophecy.

410
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:09,039
- Whereas corporatism...
- We know, Dad.

411
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:13,358
You think it'll all be about oil,
just like everything else. Oil.

412
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:15,675
Close.

413
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:17,711
Water.

414
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:22,038
The apocalypse will be over water -
who has it, who wants it

415
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:24,674
and what they're willing to do to get it.

416
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:27,234
But global warming, isn't it...

417
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:30,477
I thought that's supposed
to melt the glaciers or something.

418
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:33,159
If you like salty water,
I guess that's good news.

419
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:39,116
But what about rising sea levels or
the disruption of the thermal-haline conveyor?

420
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:41,435
That's the Gulf Stream.

421
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:44,995
Have you checked out the Pentagon
report on the Guardian website?

422
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:46,393
No.

423
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:50,069
- You have a computer here?
- Sure, downstairs in the office.

424
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:52,953
- We're done, right?
- I think so.

425
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,958
You have to see this.

426
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,195
So show me.

427
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:02,677
This stuff was actually published by
the Pentagon and it basically says

428
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:05,951
anywhere between
two and 20 years from now, kablooey!

429
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,878
- Kyle loves online.
- George, too.

430
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:15,115
It's absurd! The idea that
there are kids waiting for homes

431
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:18,948
and people still have the nerve to say
who's good enough and who isn't

432
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,638
based on are you gay or not?

433
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:22,796
People are stupid. What a shock.

434
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:25,835
There's nothing in here but fuckin' eggs.

435
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:29,156
Yeah, I'm sorry,
I thought we needed them and we didn't.

436
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,997
- Twice.
- What's this?

437
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:35,272
Oh, God, just throw that away.
Trust me, don't even wash it out.

438
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:42,715
I think we might have
some Rice-a-Roni in here or something.

439
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:46,508
- Oh, my God.
- What is it?

440
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:49,313
It's a Chinese baby!

441
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:55,479
- What's it doing in the cupboard?
- Someone must have left her here for us.

442
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:59,399
- Who?
- I don't know, someone Chinese.

443
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:02,676
What?

444
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:06,317
Couscous.

445
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:10,911
It's all we've got.

446
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:23,394
What are you doing? It's past midnight.

447
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:25,510
It's fucking unbelievable.

448
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:28,313
When you have all this information
in front of you,

449
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:30,874
it's a wonder anyone can
get up in the morning.

450
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:35,072
No one's getting up in the morning
at this rate. Come to bed.

451
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:36,951
In a minute.

452
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:39,711
Take a look at this site.

453
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:44,713
The graphic is a little simplistic.
It was obviously designed for the layman.

454
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:48,150
But you can literally watch
the world's potable water supply

455
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:50,919
dripping away moment by moment.

456
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:53,918
But that's just some people's opinion.

457
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:57,794
It's not an opinion. It's a scientific hypothesis.

458
00:34:57,840 --> 00:35:00,434
But let's just say they're half-right,

459
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:03,995
which chances are they are,
but even if they're only half-right,

460
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:06,793
we're not doing any of the things
we should be doing

461
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:09,229
in order to prevent it,
much less reverse it.

462
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:13,034
But it's all so pessimistic.
If it happens, we'll die.

463
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:15,355
But in the meantime, can't we be happy?

464
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:18,710
- Happy?
- Yes, happiness!

465
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:20,910
Don't you remember happiness?

466
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:24,555
Ruth, I'm crawling
my way to comfortable.

467
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:26,636
I can't even think about being happy

468
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:29,990
unless I'm doing something
to help save this planet

469
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:34,033
or at least prepare myself and my loved ones
for whatever it is that's next.

470
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:37,356
We're talking about the end of
life as we know it here.

471
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:41,518
- But you're obsessing about these...
- I don't think I'm obsessing.

472
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:45,348
Well, you're down here
instead of sleeping,

473
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:48,276
dreaming good dreams.

474
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:53,198
Come to bed.

475
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:57,673
All right.

476
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:01,111
I'll come to bed.

477
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:10,472
Come to bed.

478
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:18,072
Lisa is here with us

479
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:19,997
right now.

480
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:24,195
Not in this urn but in all of us.

481
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:28,194
Each of us here today,

482
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:30,196
especially little Maya,

483
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:34,153
shares a part in carrying
Lisa's eternal life

484
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:36,236
into the future.

485
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:38,316
May this dedication

486
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:41,318
of Lisa's humble ashes today

487
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:43,999
be for all of us a reawakening

488
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:48,113
to the sparkling and still vivid ways

489
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:52,278
her spirit continues to live,

490
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:54,959
grow and flourish

491
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,958
in the lives of those she loved.

492
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:00,836
Let us pray.

493
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:03,516
Our Parent,

494
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:07,030
who art in heaven,
hallowed be Thy name...

495
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:09,389
Stop it.

496
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:12,713
I want the crying to stop now.

497
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:16,270
I want it to stop.

498
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:18,629
This is hard for Mommy, too.

499
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,798
We are not leaving here until this stops.

500
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:28,473
Hallie, do you wanna go to
the Cheesecake Factory or don't you?

501
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:30,715
We are not leaving here until this stops.

502
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:32,637
Do you understand me? We're not.

503
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:34,477
- Excuse me.
- What do you want?

504
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:37,910
- She's lost her father.
- Shut up!

505
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:40,315
You shut up!

506
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:42,954
This is none of your business.

507
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:50,832
See, she's fine. Aren't you, Hallie?

508
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:55,516
You sure you two don't have time
to get coffee or anything?

509
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:58,393
No, we gotta get packed up and stuff
but thanks.

510
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:01,876
- Yeah, you sure?
- Yeah. She won't sleep on the plane.

511
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:05,356
So I'm gonna make sure
she takes a little nap first.

512
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:08,119
All right, then.
Bye, Maya. We love you.

513
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,309
Good to see you.

514
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:16,036
Say goodbye to your cousin.

515
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:20,669
- Bye.
- Keep in touch, OK?

516
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:22,711
We will. Bye.

517
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:25,870
Call us when you get there.

518
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:39,156
You should ring the bell.

519
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:42,278
The boys at school?

520
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:45,471
Yes, but it's scary when someone
just starts coming in.

521
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:47,431
You should ring the bell.

522
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:49,994
- Someone?
- Shouldn't you be at work?

523
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:53,510
- Isn't anybody dead?
- I told them I had an appointment.

524
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:03,396
I have a problem with you
bringing Kenny Simms over here

525
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:05,715
and parading him in front of my boys.

526
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:08,672
- Really?
- Yes. It'll confuse them.

527
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:13,271
It'll confuse them that an old friend from school
comes to visit me? He's my friend.

528
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:17,279
Bullshit!
You're looking, Vanessa, OK?

529
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:20,869
You're out there on the market.
You're dating, it's gonna freak out the boys.

530
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:23,434
- Look at you.
- Look at me what?

531
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:26,677
You straightened out your hair.
You don't even look like you.

532
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:29,191
I blew my hair dry, OK?

533
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:31,435
I'm a grown woman, separated from...

534
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:33,835
When did we decide we were separated?

535
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:36,678
The day you left, Rico!
You don't live here any more.

536
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:38,199
Give me the keys

537
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:40,800
or make me go to the expense
of changing the locks.

538
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:43,991
But you don't live here any more
and you can't tell me shit!

539
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:54,318
And next time you come over,
why don't you goddamn tell me first?

540
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:59,991
Should I get this to go for the car?
I'll get a straw. A straw's good, right?

541
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:02,235
- You like straws?
- Straws help.

542
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:03,998
I'll get you a straw.

543
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:12,231
Hey, guys! I didn't expect to see you.

544
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:14,271
Hey, it's Aunt Barb.

545
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:17,958
What a surprise!
I thought she was gonna take a nap!

546
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,797
Well...

547
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:21,671
chocolate muffin, you know?

548
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:24,518
We're just hanging out having a muffin.

549
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:27,515
Kids...

550
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:33,715
Barb, this is my friend Brenda.

551
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:37,872
- Hi.
- And, Brenda, this is Barb.

552
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:42,793
- Lisa's sister.
- Of course, I see it.

553
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:46,628
- Brenda Chenowith?
- Yeah.

554
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:49,319
I know your name.
Lisa mentioned it to me.

555
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:53,509
- So you two are...
- We were.

556
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:56,313
- Before Lisa.
- Yeah, we...

557
00:40:57,120 --> 00:41:00,590
Way back when Lisa came to LA
and told me she was...

558
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:03,313
Yeah. She told me all about it.

559
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:10,033
Well, it's so nice to meet you.
I had no idea that you were here.

560
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:14,312
Well, we came up here together,
we all travelled together,

561
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:17,432
but we decided that
the ceremony wouldn't be...

562
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:19,471
Of course not. No.

563
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:23,957
But how nice that
you have someone to join you

564
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,992
and be with you for everything.

565
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:35,312
Look, Maya, I got you a cup
for the car with a straw.

566
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:41,595
Well, I will let you guys
get back to your meal.

567
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:45,076
- I know you have a big trip coming up.
- Yeah, we do.

568
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:47,475
- Two planes.
- Yeah, two planes.

569
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:52,909
Well, travel safely.

570
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:55,997
Bye, honey pie, baby pie.

571
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:57,314
Bye.

572
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:02,237
- It was nice to have met you.
- And you.

573
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:04,475
Thanks.

574
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:06,954
- Bye now.
- Bye.

575
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:17,110
- Small town.
- Yeah.

576
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:35,996
- The chemicals get to you after a while.
- Yeah.

577
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:40,711
When I went to school here,
there were lines down the hall,

578
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:44,992
people waiting to get in, develop their shit,
people sleeping in here even.

579
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:49,238
Now, every time...
Every time I come in here, it's empty.

580
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:51,271
Yeah, fucking digital.

581
00:42:56,920 --> 00:42:59,229
Is it weird for you
to have me in your class?

582
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:03,871
Ls it weird for you to be in my class?

583
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:07,911
Weird in a good way.

584
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:14,475
You know, sometimes
when you're strutting around up there,

585
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:16,476
pointing at shit,

586
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:20,552
I just kind of stop
hearing what you're talking about

587
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:23,990
and like, stare at your legs

588
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,468
cos they're really long.

589
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:29,875
My legs are long?

590
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:32,957
Yeah, you're all tall.

591
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:45,915
Do you like ceviche?

592
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:49,677
- I love it.
- You wanna go to Siete Mares after this?

593
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:52,598
They have the most perfect, perfect ceviche.

594
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:54,949
I'm kind of getting addicted to spicy stuff.

595
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:58,151
Like if it doesn't hurt a little,
it's not worth eating.

596
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:01,793
I'm familiar with that dynamic.

597
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:03,831
So let's get some.

598
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:10,274
I'm almost done here.

599
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:14,029
- That's interesting.
- Isn't it?

600
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:19,354
Just the name, Rainbow Kids,
it's so fucking condescending.

601
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:21,516
David, let it go.

602
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:25,439
Another spicy tuna handroll.
And put jalapeno in this time, sliced.

603
00:44:29,320 --> 00:44:31,515
I'm gonna run to the washroom.

604
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:34,154
- I'll get the check.
- Yeah, I'm done.

605
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:37,679
And more ginger, too.

606
00:44:37,720 --> 00:44:38,994
Please.

607
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:43,630
Excuse me, did you say something?

608
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:47,470
What did you just say?

609
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:50,398
- Nothing.
- Bullshit, you said something. What?

610
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:52,590
I said, "Please."

611
00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:57,712
- To me?
- No, for you. Somebody had to.

612
00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:00,069
Who the fuck do you think you are?

613
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:03,550
Seriously.

614
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:06,876
I think I'm a member of the human race

615
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:09,957
which makes me want
to treat my fellow humans

616
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:13,436
with a certain amount of respect.
That's who I think I am.

617
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:15,277
Seriously.

618
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:23,632
Jesus! Get off me!

619
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:26,591
What the fuck?

620
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:28,551
Get the fuck off me!

621
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:31,592
- You fuckin' bit me!
- What the hell are you on?

622
00:45:31,640 --> 00:45:35,713
You tore my earring out, you cunt.
What the fuck's the matter with you?

623
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:37,557
Holy shit.

624
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:42,192
Damn it!

625
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:44,390
I really do hate to bother you folks.

626
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:47,193
It's no bother at all, Stan.

627
00:45:47,240 --> 00:45:52,633
It's just been something I couldn't get off
of my mind after the service today.

628
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:55,592
What is it?

629
00:45:55,640 --> 00:45:59,394
Well, when I was transferring
the ashes into the urn,

630
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:03,274
I couldn't help but notice
there were a lot of...

631
00:46:03,320 --> 00:46:05,197
bone fragments.

632
00:46:05,240 --> 00:46:10,394
It's the kind of thing you see
in much, much older cremains.

633
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:12,795
You hardly ever see that now.

634
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:15,718
Technology's improved so much.

635
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:19,309
Now, I could be wrong,

636
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:21,635
but the ashes that we interred...

637
00:46:23,840 --> 00:46:25,671
Just say it.

638
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:29,154
I don't think they're Lisa's.

639
00:46:36,080 --> 00:46:40,835
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, at this time</i>
<i>we will begin our descent into Los Angeles</i>.

640
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:44,919
<i>Please return your seats and tray tables</i>
<i>to their upright and locked positions</i>.

641
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:47,394
<i>We'll also be coming through</i>
<i>the cabin one more time</i>

642
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:49,908
<i>in case you have anything</i>
<i>remaining to discard</i>.

643
00:46:49,960 --> 00:46:51,678
Here we go.

644
00:48:05,720 --> 00:48:06,709
English
