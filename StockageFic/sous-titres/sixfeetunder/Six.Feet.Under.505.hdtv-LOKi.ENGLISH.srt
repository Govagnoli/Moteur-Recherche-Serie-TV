Saison 5 Episode 5
"Eat A Peach"

8
00:01:46,702 --> 00:01:49,040
I hope everybody
saved room for dessert.

9
00:02:02,051 --> 00:02:04,787
How come uncle danny
doesn't like clean peaches?

10
00:02:05,331 --> 00:02:07,700
"Cling" peaches, not clean.

11
00:02:08,055 --> 00:02:09,400
As in clingstone.

12
00:02:09,648 --> 00:02:11,835
And who says uncle danny
doesn't like cling peaches?

13
00:02:11,901 --> 00:02:14,953
Uncle danny loves cling
peaches, he just can't have any.

14
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,800
Why can't he have any?

15
00:02:16,949 --> 00:02:18,800
Because he has the diabetes.

16
00:02:19,089 --> 00:02:21,296
Hit me. Hit me again.

17
00:02:21,437 --> 00:02:23,347
We used to have that
plum tree in the backyard.

18
00:02:23,822 --> 00:02:25,916
- That wasn't a plum tree.
- You got 16, you should hold.

19
00:02:25,953 --> 00:02:28,690
- It was nectarines.
- Don't tell me when to hold. Hit me.

20
00:02:29,513 --> 00:02:30,584
You sure it was nectarines?

21
00:02:30,612 --> 00:02:31,737
- I thought it was plums.
- She never listen.

22
00:02:32,044 --> 00:02:34,300
First thing
that goes is the memory.

23
00:02:38,993 --> 00:02:41,039
Well, I made ham for christmas.

24
00:02:41,068 --> 00:02:43,598
She doesn't like ham.
I made her a capon,

25
00:02:43,626 --> 00:02:46,326
But she still didn't like that
everybody else was eating ham.

26
00:02:46,701 --> 00:02:47,744
That's so like her.

27
00:02:47,866 --> 00:02:50,734
When her daughter got a tattoo she
said, "I don't have a daughter. "

28
00:02:50,838 --> 00:02:52,669
I remember!

29
00:02:53,396 --> 00:02:55,997
How can anyone say that, that
they don't have a daughter?

30
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:58,100
She's so vindictive.

31
00:02:58,354 --> 00:03:00,054
Nothing was ever good enough for her.

32
00:03:00,147 --> 00:03:01,889
It was so sweet.

33
00:03:02,086 --> 00:03:04,936
- She's a big girl.
- No, she got her stomach stapled.

34
00:03:04,983 --> 00:03:07,157
- She did that?
- Yeah, she lost almost 200 Ibs.!

35
00:03:07,457 --> 00:03:09,600
- No kidding?
- Yeah, she got married.

36
00:03:09,687 --> 00:03:11,870
- She did?
- She married a foot doctor.

37
00:03:11,955 --> 00:03:14,687
- She was so sweet.
- Yeah, and then she married a foot doctor.

38
00:03:14,715 --> 00:03:17,025
- I went to the foot doctor.
- For your corns?

39
00:03:17,072 --> 00:03:18,429
For my bone spur.

40
00:03:18,476 --> 00:03:21,800
- You had a bone spur?
- Painful like you would not believe.

41
00:03:22,005 --> 00:03:24,127
- Did you get the surgery?
- They did.

42
00:03:24,364 --> 00:03:26,800
Doctors! What they can't do today.

43
00:03:27,279 --> 00:03:30,100
Staple your stomach,
shave off a bone spur.

44
00:04:20,449 --> 00:04:22,100
That was...

45
00:04:22,844 --> 00:04:23,994
That was lovely.

46
00:04:24,163 --> 00:04:27,000
- Wasn't it?

47
00:04:33,792 --> 00:04:35,600
I know how hard this has been on you.

48
00:04:36,542 --> 00:04:39,355
I know you. I want to make it up to you.

49
00:04:39,514 --> 00:04:40,900
You don't have to
make anything up to me.

50
00:04:41,585 --> 00:04:44,477
I wanna try to close
this distance between us.

51
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:47,355
What distance?

52
00:04:47,589 --> 00:04:49,425
I think we should travel.

53
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:51,040
Travel?

54
00:04:51,087 --> 00:04:53,400
George, you're not...
You're not well.

55
00:04:53,871 --> 00:04:56,328
No, I'm feeling much much better.

56
00:04:57,163 --> 00:04:59,200
Where onarth would we travel to?

57
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,595
Anywhere we wanted to.

58
00:05:01,802 --> 00:05:04,965
Anywhere the wind blows us.

59
00:05:05,154 --> 00:05:07,700
Could we talk about it another time?

60
00:05:09,548 --> 00:05:11,900
Yeah, sure.

61
00:05:12,839 --> 00:05:14,500
Of course.

62
00:05:35,511 --> 00:05:38,539
You know, I was thinking about
inviting Maggie over some time.

63
00:05:38,886 --> 00:05:40,797
- What for?
- She's new in town.

64
00:05:40,835 --> 00:05:43,900
She doesn't really know anybody,
except for George and my mother.

65
00:05:44,783 --> 00:05:46,700
I don't know, I think you'd like her.

66
00:05:46,735 --> 00:05:50,300
- Okay.
- I need to go potty.

67
00:05:50,989 --> 00:05:52,800
Oh, well, I am running a little late,

68
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:55,200
So mommy will take you, okay?

69
00:05:58,262 --> 00:06:01,000
Maya, do you remember your other mommy?

70
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,562
- What are you doing?
- Just asking her an honest question.

71
00:06:07,468 --> 00:06:09,500
It's important that
we're honest with her,

72
00:06:09,851 --> 00:06:12,300
That she grows up with
a coherent narrative,

73
00:06:12,376 --> 00:06:15,273
That she understands
where she came from, and ...

74
00:06:16,143 --> 00:06:17,765
How I came into the picture.

75
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:20,787
I am all for her growing up
with a coherent narrative,

76
00:06:20,825 --> 00:06:22,848
But I think that we have
to pick the right time

77
00:06:22,895 --> 00:06:25,100
To start telling this particular story.

78
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:26,717
I mean, don't you think?

79
00:06:26,754 --> 00:06:29,065
I need to go potty!

80
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:31,600
What better time than the present?

81
00:06:31,674 --> 00:06:33,679
Well, how about after she
makes potty, for starters?

82
00:06:33,904 --> 00:06:37,735
Okay. Come on, mommy is
gonna take you to make potty.

83
00:06:48,005 --> 00:06:50,014
Should we call mary?

84
00:06:50,216 --> 00:06:52,484
No, we don't wanna pressure her.

85
00:06:52,624 --> 00:06:54,563
Pressure? We just inseminated her.

86
00:06:55,502 --> 00:06:56,601
Has she tried to call you?

87
00:06:56,648 --> 00:06:58,900
You inseminated her, okay?

88
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:00,714
Well, not personally I didn't.

89
00:07:01,577 --> 00:07:03,100
Has she tried to call
you on your cell phone?

90
00:07:03,178 --> 00:07:05,600
Keith, relax. I'm sure
if she was pregnant,

91
00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:07,995
We'd be the first people she called.

92
00:07:12,014 --> 00:07:15,812
- I'm not sure I wanna do this.
- Do what?

93
00:07:17,056 --> 00:07:19,009
Go to this adoption fair.

94
00:07:20,188 --> 00:07:22,174
First of all, it's not
a fair, it's a picnic.

95
00:07:22,624 --> 00:07:23,864
Second of all, we have to.

96
00:07:23,901 --> 00:07:27,900
Sissy pasquese wenthrough a lot of
trouble to get us moved up the list.

97
00:07:28,376 --> 00:07:30,615
It just... it seems weird.

98
00:07:31,009 --> 00:07:32,620
Weird how?

99
00:07:32,704 --> 00:07:35,329
Like we're... going to look at puppies.

100
00:07:35,394 --> 00:07:38,216
We're not going to look at puppies.

101
00:07:38,413 --> 00:07:40,268
We don't know if mary is even pregnant,

102
00:07:40,324 --> 00:07:42,582
Or ever will get pregnant.

103
00:07:42,742 --> 00:07:45,047
Besides, we always agreed
we'd keep moving forward

104
00:07:45,066 --> 00:07:47,178
On both prongs of the
two-Pronged approach

105
00:07:47,272 --> 00:07:49,400
Until one of the prongs pays off.

106
00:07:54,385 --> 00:07:55,800
Look at us.

107
00:07:55,859 --> 00:07:57,800
You know what we look like?

108
00:07:58,230 --> 00:08:00,310
Homos.

109
00:08:01,277 --> 00:08:02,347
He wanted to be cremated.

110
00:08:02,413 --> 00:08:04,385
- No, he didn't!
- We had a conversation.

111
00:08:04,423 --> 00:08:06,869
- He was my brother.
- He was my brother too.

112
00:08:06,897 --> 00:08:09,100
And if carl says he
wanted to be cremated,

113
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:10,493
That's what we're gonna do.

114
00:08:10,549 --> 00:08:12,479
- Over my dead body!
- Fine with me!

115
00:08:12,545 --> 00:08:13,690
Can we please take it down a notch?

116
00:08:13,718 --> 00:08:16,413
- She was always difficult.
- You leave her alone.

117
00:08:16,441 --> 00:08:19,549
Is there something in your faith
that might provide us with some...

118
00:08:19,737 --> 00:08:21,723
- Guidelines.
- We have no faith.

119
00:08:21,761 --> 00:08:23,920
- We did when we were children.
- This is america.

120
00:08:23,948 --> 00:08:26,930
Since when do we have to have a
faith in order to bury our brother?

121
00:08:26,948 --> 00:08:28,380
I didn't mean to imply, sir...

122
00:08:28,474 --> 00:08:29,746
We're catholic, but lapsed.

123
00:08:29,765 --> 00:08:33,681
You may be lapsed. Vera and i
still go to mass every sunday.

124
00:08:33,709 --> 00:08:35,965
It's a waste of time! There is no god.

125
00:08:36,164 --> 00:08:39,450
All I know is danny did
not want to be cremated.

126
00:08:39,485 --> 00:08:42,915
He did! He told me himself
six months ago at bingo.

127
00:08:43,254 --> 00:08:46,113
He told you he wanted
to be cremated at bingo?

128
00:08:46,131 --> 00:08:48,122
Look, I think what we all need to do

129
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:50,014
Is take a collective deep breath,

130
00:08:50,042 --> 00:08:52,498
And try to be honest
about what we think, uh...

131
00:08:53,221 --> 00:08:55,648
Daniel would have wanted.

132
00:08:55,817 --> 00:08:57,700
Not what we might want.

133
00:09:07,343 --> 00:09:10,592
I feel like everyone's just here
to scope out the most adorable kid.

134
00:09:10,836 --> 00:09:13,357
They're all adorable-
On the surface.

135
00:09:13,629 --> 00:09:16,854
All these kids have gone through some
serious damaging shit in their lives.

136
00:09:17,146 --> 00:09:18,714
Like we haven't?

137
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:21,526
This whole thing's a little
weird, don't you think?

138
00:09:22,094 --> 00:09:24,249
- It's just kids playing.
- It's not.

139
00:09:24,333 --> 00:09:26,052
They're acutely aware
that they're being observed

140
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,423
Like some animals in a zoo.

141
00:09:29,643 --> 00:09:30,911
Have you seen my brother?

142
00:09:34,066 --> 00:09:35,700
What about her?

143
00:09:37,708 --> 00:09:39,600
She's adorable, but she's surrounded.

144
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:41,500
We've got to get in there.

145
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:05,400
Hi.

146
00:10:06,269 --> 00:10:07,865
Hi.

147
00:10:08,724 --> 00:10:10,600
You keep getting sand in your shoes?

148
00:10:10,985 --> 00:10:13,399
That's why I hate sandboxes so much.

149
00:10:13,812 --> 00:10:16,000
There's so much sand in them.

150
00:10:22,450 --> 00:10:23,915
<i>Such a battle in which the marines</i>

151
00:10:23,924 --> 00:10:27,267
<i>Had a high-Tech advantage,
and you're looking through it.</i>

152
00:10:27,385 --> 00:10:31,047
<i>They moved forward in pitch
black using night vision-</i>

153
00:10:31,563 --> 00:10:32,728
Thanks though.

154
00:10:33,476 --> 00:10:35,983
I wasn't sure if you did or not.

155
00:10:36,396 --> 00:10:38,900
In my younger days I did.

156
00:10:39,284 --> 00:10:40,424
But, uh...

157
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:43,600
Right now I'm not sure it
would mix so well with my meds.

158
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:50,773
You could eat downstairs
with us, you know?

159
00:10:51,308 --> 00:10:53,398
Yeah, I don't know if you've noticed,

160
00:10:53,445 --> 00:10:55,651
But I'm kind of trying
to avoid mom right now.

161
00:10:57,698 --> 00:10:59,985
You might wanna take it easy on her.

162
00:11:00,369 --> 00:11:01,693
She's been through a lot lately.

163
00:11:01,769 --> 00:11:04,369
That puts her in the same boat
as the rest of us, doesn't it?

164
00:11:08,919 --> 00:11:10,675
I really like that piece.

165
00:11:12,125 --> 00:11:13,459
God!

166
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:16,111
Why is that like the one
thing that people like?

167
00:11:16,327 --> 00:11:18,294
You know? So I tore up some photos,

168
00:11:18,341 --> 00:11:19,839
Who cares?

169
00:11:19,914 --> 00:11:22,459
It's like everybody wants that
to be the one thing that I can do.

170
00:11:22,496 --> 00:11:25,078
I just think it's very provocative, and...

171
00:11:25,834 --> 00:11:27,059
Disturbing.

172
00:11:27,106 --> 00:11:29,219
And beautiful.

173
00:11:29,782 --> 00:11:31,566
Isn't that what art is
supposed to be about?

174
00:11:33,688 --> 00:11:36,425
Just right now,
With all the shit going on in the world,

175
00:11:36,557 --> 00:11:39,397
Art seems kind of besides
the point, you know?

176
00:11:40,008 --> 00:11:42,341
Yeah, I do know.

177
00:11:42,369 --> 00:11:45,332
Plus, I'm just not like inspired.

178
00:11:45,679 --> 00:11:49,327
Well, if the muse isn't with
you, the muse isn't with you.

179
00:11:50,524 --> 00:11:52,444
Exactly, George.

180
00:11:52,745 --> 00:11:55,256
George! Here you are.

181
00:11:55,294 --> 00:11:56,900
You had me so worried.

182
00:11:57,266 --> 00:12:00,388
- I'm fine.
- What on earth are you doing up here?

183
00:12:01,111 --> 00:12:03,322
I'm- I'm just, uh...

184
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,947
Hanging out. Do you
need me for something?

185
00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:08,500
No, I just wanted to
know where you were.

186
00:12:10,303 --> 00:12:12,000
You left your laundry in the dryer.

187
00:12:12,524 --> 00:12:14,064
Sorry.

188
00:12:14,167 --> 00:12:16,247
Is that my food?

189
00:12:17,186 --> 00:12:18,600
It's from the fridge.

190
00:12:18,749 --> 00:12:20,890
- The family fridge?
- Yeah, so?

191
00:12:20,975 --> 00:12:24,500
- I'm coming down.
- No, don't please. Stay here.

192
00:12:29,097 --> 00:12:31,153
Your phone's ringing.

193
00:12:31,238 --> 00:12:32,712
I know.

194
00:12:33,956 --> 00:12:35,496
I just thought...

195
00:12:35,693 --> 00:12:36,965
You know...

196
00:12:37,613 --> 00:12:40,158
Maybe you were too stoned.

197
00:12:44,496 --> 00:12:45,867
Hello?

198
00:12:49,989 --> 00:12:52,111
I've never been in one
of these before, have you?

199
00:12:54,106 --> 00:12:55,533
This is fun, huh?

200
00:13:01,141 --> 00:13:04,558
You know something? If I don't stop
doing this, I think I'm gonna throw up.

201
00:13:11,186 --> 00:13:12,848
Are you okay?

202
00:13:13,196 --> 00:13:15,914
Yeah, just a little queasy, that's all.

203
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:18,613
There's no way you could
ever be an astronaut.

204
00:13:20,543 --> 00:13:21,637
Why not?

205
00:13:21,684 --> 00:13:24,642
'Cause you can't throw up if
you're gonna be an astronaut.

206
00:13:26,163 --> 00:13:29,100
I've never really thought about it
that way, but I guess you're right.

207
00:13:30,651 --> 00:13:32,800
My mom's coming back to get me.

208
00:13:33,623 --> 00:13:36,500
- She is?
- As soon as she gets out of rehab.

209
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:38,400
That's in six more weeks.

210
00:13:42,858 --> 00:13:44,900
I couldn't break through the gauntlet.

211
00:13:45,177 --> 00:13:46,500
This is anthony.

212
00:13:46,825 --> 00:13:47,923
Hi, anthony.

213
00:13:47,961 --> 00:13:50,895
- Anthony, this is Keith.
- Hi.

214
00:13:51,167 --> 00:13:53,100
Anthony's not up for adoption.

215
00:13:53,257 --> 00:13:54,994
- You're not?
- No.

216
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,487
My mom's coming back to get me.

217
00:13:59,003 --> 00:14:00,951
Good for you.

218
00:14:01,703 --> 00:14:03,351
The moon bounce make you hurl?

219
00:14:03,426 --> 00:14:05,149
- No.
- almost.

220
00:14:06,351 --> 00:14:08,003
He gets motion sickness.

221
00:14:08,059 --> 00:14:11,627
- He could never be an astronaut.
- No way.

222
00:14:18,878 --> 00:14:20,230
Excuse me. Hi.

223
00:14:20,286 --> 00:14:23,826
I'm sorry to bother you, but your kid
was picking on my kid during recess.

224
00:14:23,929 --> 00:14:25,723
- Excuse me?
- Tell her.

225
00:14:25,770 --> 00:14:27,173
He pushed me down in the bathroom

226
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:29,347
And tried to take my
"yu-Gi-Oh" backpack.

227
00:14:30,239 --> 00:14:32,300
No, that's can't be true.

228
00:14:32,338 --> 00:14:34,309
He must have julio mixed up
with some other kid.

229
00:14:34,310 --> 00:14:36,000
No, he said it was your kid.

230
00:14:36,954 --> 00:14:38,363
That's not true, is it, julio?

231
00:14:38,579 --> 00:14:41,419
Because you would never do
something like that, would u?

232
00:14:41,569 --> 00:14:43,987
- Your kid made a mistake, you see?
- It was him!

233
00:14:44,062 --> 00:14:46,799
- He just said he didn't do it.
- He did it, he's lying!

234
00:14:47,006 --> 00:14:49,147
My son doesn't lie. Julio?

235
00:14:49,288 --> 00:14:50,888
I didn't do it.

236
00:14:51,058 --> 00:14:52,657
He says he didn't do it,
that's good enough for me.

237
00:14:52,658 --> 00:14:55,736
- He did it!
- So what, it was just a stupid game.

238
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:10,757
Thanks for coming.

239
00:15:10,794 --> 00:15:13,188
Okay. Yeah, sure.

240
00:15:13,256 --> 00:15:14,852
How are you?

241
00:15:14,955 --> 00:15:16,542
I'm good.

242
00:15:16,645 --> 00:15:18,556
Yeah? I'm good too.

243
00:15:19,326 --> 00:15:21,566
I'm, uh, I'm back on my meds.

244
00:15:24,091 --> 00:15:26,000
Good.

245
00:15:28,519 --> 00:15:31,444
Is there some specific reason you
couldn't tell me that on the phone?

246
00:15:33,108 --> 00:15:35,300
I just needed to see you.

247
00:15:36,261 --> 00:15:38,439
I could use some... closure.

248
00:15:39,115 --> 00:15:40,913
- That's all.
- Okay.

249
00:15:41,988 --> 00:15:45,388
- Should we order?
- I'm not really hungry.

250
00:15:47,357 --> 00:15:49,282
Yeah, me neither.

251
00:15:56,335 --> 00:15:59,105
Is that it? Have we achieved closure?

252
00:15:59,689 --> 00:16:02,027
Yeah, I guess. I just-

253
00:16:02,168 --> 00:16:03,811
What?

254
00:16:03,924 --> 00:16:07,400
I just want you to know
that I still care about you.

255
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:10,200
Okay, I think I know that.

256
00:16:11,337 --> 00:16:13,309
Do you still care about me?

257
00:16:13,722 --> 00:16:15,469
Yeah, of course I still care about you,

258
00:16:15,497 --> 00:16:17,469
But we're broken up now.

259
00:16:18,051 --> 00:16:19,800
Of course we are.

260
00:16:21,642 --> 00:16:23,196
Can I give you a hug?

261
00:16:24,802 --> 00:16:26,295
Sure.

262
00:16:35,605 --> 00:16:37,483
- Okay, I'm going now.
- Oh, great.

263
00:16:37,586 --> 00:16:40,000
Look, can I walk you to your car?

264
00:16:40,107 --> 00:16:41,741
No.

265
00:16:41,863 --> 00:16:43,595
Thank you.

266
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:48,670
All right. I'just gonna stay here
and have a piece of pie.

267
00:16:48,946 --> 00:16:50,768
- Bye.

268
00:17:04,627 --> 00:17:06,035
Hi.

269
00:17:06,498 --> 00:17:08,583
Hello. Uh...?

270
00:17:09,015 --> 00:17:12,775
- Oh, I'm just here to pick up my dad.
- Oh, cool. Uh, he's upstairs.

271
00:17:12,935 --> 00:17:15,043
- Great.
- Care for a mint?

272
00:17:16,051 --> 00:17:17,741
We buy them in bulk.

273
00:17:17,835 --> 00:17:19,765
- No thanks.
- Yeah.

274
00:17:20,723 --> 00:17:24,314
Hey, uh, would you like to come over
for dinner tomorrow night?

275
00:17:24,407 --> 00:17:26,266
- Here?
- No, at my place.

276
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:29,276
I mean our place- Brenda,
Maya and me, I mean.

277
00:17:29,942 --> 00:17:31,431
- Okay.
- Good.

278
00:17:31,534 --> 00:17:33,041
- I'd like that.
- All right.

279
00:17:33,107 --> 00:17:35,891
- We're here.
- With the food.

280
00:17:37,731 --> 00:17:40,511
- Okay, well, tomorrow then.
- Yeah yeah.

281
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:43,374
With food? Who said anything about food?

282
00:17:43,468 --> 00:17:45,032
The cold cuts for during the viewing.

283
00:17:45,088 --> 00:17:48,332
- Danny would've wanted there to be food.
- So we brought cold cuts.

284
00:17:48,370 --> 00:17:50,187
And bacon-Wrapped ham balls.

285
00:17:50,879 --> 00:17:52,396
It's what he would've wanted.

286
00:17:52,471 --> 00:17:55,123
- Well, of course, fine.
- Where do we put 'em?

287
00:17:55,311 --> 00:17:56,785
Downstairs in the refrigerator.

288
00:17:56,851 --> 00:17:59,696
Oh, but wait, you have
to let me... take those.

289
00:18:00,053 --> 00:18:01,410
I'll put them down there.

290
00:18:01,504 --> 00:18:03,180
I got 'em. It's okay.

291
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,363
He doesn't even
want to be adopted.

292
00:18:05,410 --> 00:18:09,997
Of course he's gonna say that. He's gotta
protect himself from further rejection.

293
00:18:10,166 --> 00:18:12,884
I just thought he was special.

294
00:18:13,372 --> 00:18:15,339
Not retarded special.

295
00:18:17,053 --> 00:18:19,114
You connected with him too, you know?

296
00:18:19,415 --> 00:18:20,795
He has serious problems, David.

297
00:18:20,832 --> 00:18:22,635
You liked him, you know you did.

298
00:18:22,701 --> 00:18:25,260
- He was kinda cute.
- He was, wasn't he?

299
00:18:25,316 --> 00:18:27,518
Yeah, in a fucked-Up-
With-Serious-Problems kind of way.

300
00:18:27,621 --> 00:18:30,734
- I want him.
- Are you serious?

301
00:18:30,884 --> 00:18:32,734
I think we could give
him a happy childhood.

302
00:18:32,893 --> 00:18:35,645
We can't undo anything that's already
happened to him, you know that.

303
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:38,138
- Yes, I know that.
- It's not gonna change anything

304
00:18:38,166 --> 00:18:39,706
That's already happened to you either.

305
00:18:41,255 --> 00:18:43,400
I know that too.

306
00:18:45,950 --> 00:18:48,598
I just think it's doable.

307
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:57,987
What are you doing here?

308
00:18:58,185 --> 00:19:01,109
I heard julio got into some
trouble at school today.

309
00:19:01,504 --> 00:19:03,077
Who did you hear that from?

310
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:05,044
I'm on the carnival planning committee.

311
00:19:05,194 --> 00:19:08,555
One of the moms told me and I thought
i'd stop by to see if I could help.

312
00:19:08,696 --> 00:19:10,964
Since when are you on
the carnival committee?

313
00:19:11,030 --> 00:19:12,734
I don't see them every day at home.

314
00:19:13,307 --> 00:19:15,227
I think it's important that
I be involved at school.

315
00:19:15,255 --> 00:19:16,931
It's fine. I can handle it.

316
00:19:16,978 --> 00:19:19,748
- What happened?
- He picked on one of the other boys.

317
00:19:19,814 --> 00:19:22,654
- For no reason?
- It's no big deal.

318
00:19:23,058 --> 00:19:25,034
Oh sure, it's no big deal.

319
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,330
Just like us sleeping
together is no big deal, right?

320
00:19:27,349 --> 00:19:29,000
Let's just pretend
like it never happened.

321
00:19:29,438 --> 00:19:31,499
It's just boys being boys, Rico!

322
00:19:31,790 --> 00:19:33,064
Yeah, where is he? I wanna talk to him.

323
00:19:33,083 --> 00:19:35,135
It's late. He's in bed.
They're both in bed.

324
00:19:35,210 --> 00:19:38,323
When I was a kid, when I got into
trouble my old man took a belt to me.

325
00:19:38,379 --> 00:19:40,092
It's a good thing
you're not your old man.

326
00:19:40,186 --> 00:19:42,454
- Can I come in?
- No, you cannot come in!

327
00:19:42,510 --> 00:19:45,989
Not tonight, Rico. I'm
taking care of this. Go home.

328
00:19:57,154 --> 00:19:59,661
- Is she asleep?
- Yeah.

329
00:20:10,562 --> 00:20:12,811
I wanna talk about what
happened this morning.

330
00:20:13,975 --> 00:20:15,665
Okay.

331
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:19,956
First of all, it made me angry
that you would say that to her

332
00:20:19,975 --> 00:20:22,600
Without us talking about it first.

333
00:20:25,308 --> 00:20:26,938
You're right.

334
00:20:28,881 --> 00:20:30,332
I am sorry.

335
00:20:31,205 --> 00:20:32,346
Thank you.

336
00:20:32,393 --> 00:20:34,844
But Nate, it's always better
to acknowledge the truth.

337
00:20:34,966 --> 00:20:38,003
Yes, I am all in favor
of being honest with her

338
00:20:38,031 --> 00:20:40,865
About where she came
from and who she is.

339
00:20:41,191 --> 00:20:43,765
I just think that we should
follow her lead on this one.

340
00:20:44,595 --> 00:20:47,416
When she's old enough to start asking
those questions, then we'll answer them.

341
00:20:47,529 --> 00:20:51,036
But just because she doesn't have
the language to ask the questions

342
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:53,961
Doesn't mean that she isn't
mentally capable of asking them.

343
00:20:54,008 --> 00:20:56,595
Right... I just think that
you're gonna confuse her.

344
00:20:56,661 --> 00:20:59,097
Okay, listen. One day
she's gonna find out

345
00:20:59,154 --> 00:21:01,172
That I am not her biological mother.

346
00:21:01,341 --> 00:21:04,609
Now, I'm trying to avoid that
moment of horrible explanation.

347
00:21:04,675 --> 00:21:07,158
There doesn't have to be a
horrible moment of anything.

348
00:21:07,186 --> 00:21:10,454
Kids need to know their stories, it's
how they integrate their sense of self.

349
00:21:10,482 --> 00:21:13,196
Kids don't need to know everything. There
is such a thing as too much information.

350
00:21:13,252 --> 00:21:15,168
You of all people should know that.

351
00:21:15,459 --> 00:21:18,102
So I grew up with parents
who had no boundaries.

352
00:21:18,121 --> 00:21:20,440
You grew up with parents that
had nothing but boundaries.

353
00:21:20,473 --> 00:21:21,999
Do you think that was so much better?

354
00:21:22,027 --> 00:21:23,891
I just don't want you
throwing shit at her

355
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:26,567
From some book you haven't
even finished reading yet!

356
00:21:27,036 --> 00:21:30,092
She's my daughter and i
get to decide that much.

357
00:21:39,848 --> 00:21:43,196
It's gotten so bad I can't even stand
to sit at the dinner table with him.

358
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:46,862
Relationships change.
They do, they do.

359
00:21:47,017 --> 00:21:50,304
Does he bite his fork? I had a
boyfriend once who bit his fork,

360
00:21:50,341 --> 00:21:52,482
And it so gave me the chills.

361
00:21:52,538 --> 00:21:54,332
No, he doesn't bite his fork.

362
00:21:54,388 --> 00:21:56,656
He's not being abusive
in any way, is he?

363
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:58,985
No no no, he just insists on talking

364
00:21:59,050 --> 00:22:01,346
About everything, all the time.

365
00:22:01,543 --> 00:22:03,050
I can't stand the sound of his voice.

366
00:22:03,069 --> 00:22:05,050
It's like fingernails on a blackboard.

367
00:22:05,285 --> 00:22:08,046
You know, I know what this is.

368
00:22:08,299 --> 00:22:09,562
What?

369
00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:13,172
A friend of mine nursed her husband
though cancer a few year ago,

370
00:22:13,524 --> 00:22:16,022
And when he was cured, she was done.

371
00:22:16,858 --> 00:22:18,811
With him?

372
00:22:18,961 --> 00:22:20,947
It wasn't his fault,
it wasn't her fault,

373
00:22:21,022 --> 00:22:22,825
She was just done.

374
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:26,848
You know, we were talking...

375
00:22:26,877 --> 00:22:30,421
About going to tangier
for a little somethin'.

376
00:22:30,449 --> 00:22:32,482
You wanna come, yeah?

377
00:22:32,567 --> 00:22:35,247
I can't. I have to go home
and fix dinner for George.

378
00:22:35,323 --> 00:22:39,412
Oh, Ruth! You need to do things
For yourself every now and then.

379
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:42,243
It's important-
Care of the self.

380
00:22:42,449 --> 00:22:45,477
It is. It is.

381
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:50,712
Okay.

382
00:22:53,675 --> 00:22:56,229
I had a dream about anthony last night.

383
00:22:57,116 --> 00:22:59,487
See, I knew he got to you.

384
00:22:59,975 --> 00:23:01,886
He kept putting blankets on top of me.

385
00:23:02,055 --> 00:23:03,905
Each one weighed like a ton.

386
00:23:03,999 --> 00:23:06,848
My ribs felt like they were gonna
break and I couldn't breathe.

387
00:23:09,238 --> 00:23:11,600
Well, at least he made an impression.

388
00:23:19,271 --> 00:23:22,398
- Hello.
- Guess who's pregnant!

389
00:23:22,548 --> 00:23:23,398
You are?

390
00:23:23,426 --> 00:23:26,388
That's right, I'm
having your guys's baby!

391
00:23:26,454 --> 00:23:29,046
- Mary's pregnant.
- She is?

392
00:23:29,130 --> 00:23:32,055
At first I thought I was just late,

393
00:23:32,111 --> 00:23:34,839
But now I'm really late, plus
i've been craving carne asada.

394
00:23:34,905 --> 00:23:36,618
And you know what that means!

395
00:23:36,694 --> 00:23:38,534
Well, maybe you don't, but I do.

396
00:23:38,562 --> 00:23:42,313
- Should I tell her we're happy?
- I guess so. I mean... yeah.

397
00:23:42,642 --> 00:23:45,276
David and I are both very excited.

398
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:47,459
Me too, I mean, at the
very least this means

399
00:23:47,487 --> 00:23:49,595
I can start having sex
with my husband again.

400
00:23:49,632 --> 00:23:51,881
He will be so fucking happy. Yay!

401
00:23:52,266 --> 00:23:55,262
Listen, I gotta go. I got diarrhea
like you would not believe.

402
00:23:55,459 --> 00:23:57,586
Which by the way, is also

403
00:23:57,661 --> 00:23:59,872
A very positive sign. But
i'll call you guys later, okay?

404
00:24:00,050 --> 00:24:01,942
Okay. Hey, mary?

405
00:24:07,698 --> 00:24:09,370
We're gonna be dads!

406
00:24:10,234 --> 00:24:12,600
What about anthony?

407
00:24:16,388 --> 00:24:19,100
Well, somebody else will find him.

408
00:24:19,238 --> 00:24:20,797
Look, except for taylor,

409
00:24:20,863 --> 00:24:23,065
We really don't have
much experience with kids.

410
00:24:23,121 --> 00:24:25,229
And I think taking on
more than one right now

411
00:24:25,257 --> 00:24:28,158
- Would be, uh-
- Would be crazy.

412
00:24:29,107 --> 00:24:31,100
Do you disagree?

413
00:24:31,745 --> 00:24:33,689
No, I don't.

414
00:24:54,588 --> 00:24:56,983
Hello?
Claire?

415
00:24:57,818 --> 00:25:00,560
Hi, it's Margaret, Margaret Chenowith.

416
00:25:01,325 --> 00:25:02,936
Oh, hi.

417
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:04,339
Listen, I hate to call you like this,

418
00:25:04,368 --> 00:25:07,062
But there's a serious
problem with Billy.

419
00:25:07,541 --> 00:25:09,283
Is he okay?

420
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:12,912
Well, perhaps it would be
better if we spoke in person.

421
00:25:13,194 --> 00:25:15,311
Oh... okay.

422
00:25:16,987 --> 00:25:20,128
I just want to apologize
to the both of you

423
00:25:20,184 --> 00:25:22,100
For my son's behavior.

424
00:25:22,147 --> 00:25:24,386
Your wife wasn't very apologetic.

425
00:25:24,537 --> 00:25:27,246
Then I apologize for
her behavior as well.

426
00:25:27,386 --> 00:25:30,574
You see, my wife and I are
separated, so as you can imagine

427
00:25:30,687 --> 00:25:34,184
- This has been a difficult time for julio.
- Of course.

428
00:25:35,025 --> 00:25:37,152
And my wife has been on antidepressants.

429
00:25:37,170 --> 00:25:40,200
So she's been a little lax
on doling out discipline.

430
00:25:40,987 --> 00:25:44,626
Plus she was dating this guy who back
in high school was a total pothead.

431
00:25:44,776 --> 00:25:47,166
And for all I know, still is.

432
00:25:47,391 --> 00:25:50,607
I just think all the stuff at home
has contributed to julio acting out-

433
00:25:50,701 --> 00:25:52,199
With your son.

434
00:25:52,321 --> 00:25:55,879
And I've already talked to julio and
he would like to apologize to your son.

435
00:25:56,011 --> 00:25:59,368
Tomorrow morning, before
school, if that's okay.

436
00:25:59,762 --> 00:26:02,922
Yeah yeah. Uh, that would be lovely.

437
00:26:03,762 --> 00:26:05,837
Well, I wish we had more
fathers like you in this school.

438
00:26:05,922 --> 00:26:09,283
Yeah well, I'm a funeral
director. And perhaps that's why

439
00:26:09,302 --> 00:26:11,757
I'm a little better at dealing
with people than my wife-

440
00:26:11,870 --> 00:26:14,569
Well, my
almost-Ex-Wife.

441
00:26:17,429 --> 00:26:20,433
So- Do you
think that

442
00:26:20,654 --> 00:26:24,095
It's our impending divorce
that's causing julio to...

443
00:26:24,321 --> 00:26:27,600
You know, misbehave?

444
00:26:28,706 --> 00:26:30,950
I suppose it's possible.

445
00:26:31,785 --> 00:26:34,300
Thank you for being honest with me.

446
00:26:35,044 --> 00:26:36,499
You know...

447
00:26:36,715 --> 00:26:39,790
There's some other things that
have been going on as well.

448
00:26:41,447 --> 00:26:43,297
Frankie yankovic was his favorite.

449
00:26:43,391 --> 00:26:45,710
Frankie yankovic was not his favorite.

450
00:26:45,738 --> 00:26:47,893
He was his favorite.
He had all his records.

451
00:26:47,959 --> 00:26:49,283
All of them!

452
00:26:49,330 --> 00:26:51,706
Herbie hancock was his favorite.

453
00:26:51,818 --> 00:26:54,490
He wanted herbie hancock
played at his funeral.

454
00:26:54,649 --> 00:26:57,692
- He told me that, years ago.
- Okay, look...

455
00:26:58,292 --> 00:27:01,344
Maybe he had two favorites.
You ever think of that?

456
00:27:01,438 --> 00:27:04,184
Who the hell has two favorites?

457
00:27:04,382 --> 00:27:06,818
I have two favorites.

458
00:27:06,903 --> 00:27:09,077
In fact, I have at least
three favorite songs.

459
00:27:09,105 --> 00:27:11,907
And my daughter- You know
what her favorite color is?

460
00:27:12,048 --> 00:27:15,058
Blue... and green.

461
00:27:15,368 --> 00:27:17,851
So here's what we're gonna do,
we're gonna play frankie yankovic

462
00:27:17,964 --> 00:27:20,236
And herbie hancock. How's that?

463
00:27:23,673 --> 00:27:26,480
You said this was
some kind of emergency.

464
00:27:27,025 --> 00:27:29,300
I've never said emergency.

465
00:27:29,795 --> 00:27:32,602
Yeah, but you definitely
kind of implied it.

466
00:27:33,044 --> 00:27:35,457
Billy has harmed himself in the past.

467
00:27:35,757 --> 00:27:37,307
He could do it again, you know?

468
00:27:37,457 --> 00:27:39,523
Okay, that's not my problem.

469
00:27:39,832 --> 00:27:41,443
Billy told me everything, Claire.

470
00:27:41,452 --> 00:27:42,875
And believe me,
I understand-

471
00:27:42,903 --> 00:27:45,415
Given the family you come
from- Why you ended it.

472
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:48,180
My family doesn't have
anything to do with it.

473
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:51,429
You know Billy also told
me that the sex was erratic.

474
00:27:51,565 --> 00:27:53,184
Now that was his fault.

475
00:27:53,410 --> 00:27:56,593
And by the way, he's on a new
medication with fewer side effects.

476
00:27:56,889 --> 00:27:58,771
But he did say that when he was able to,

477
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:01,025
And when he was up for
it, the sex was very good.

478
00:28:01,837 --> 00:28:03,926
For Billy, that's
really saying something.

479
00:28:04,030 --> 00:28:06,626
He told you about our sex?

480
00:28:06,663 --> 00:28:09,095
Of course he did. I'm his mother!

481
00:28:10,039 --> 00:28:12,039
You know, when you were with him,

482
00:28:12,142 --> 00:28:14,757
There was this light behind his eyes.

483
00:28:14,823 --> 00:28:17,494
I haven't seen that
in him since he was...

484
00:28:17,551 --> 00:28:19,166
I don't know, four?

485
00:28:19,250 --> 00:28:20,776
You were really good for him, Claire.

486
00:28:20,907 --> 00:28:23,419
He's better off without me.

487
00:28:23,513 --> 00:28:26,410
And even if he isn't, i
am better off without him.

488
00:28:26,654 --> 00:28:28,217
What do you need from
him to make this work?

489
00:28:28,321 --> 00:28:32,692
- This isn't a negotiation.
- Everything is negotiable.

490
00:28:33,668 --> 00:28:36,504
I have a son who tried to
kill himself in the past.

491
00:28:37,443 --> 00:28:39,959
Now he still really loves you.

492
00:28:40,053 --> 00:28:42,912
And I think you still love him.

493
00:28:48,729 --> 00:28:51,142
- Hey.
- Hey.

494
00:28:53,607 --> 00:28:55,626
- How's my girl doing, huh?
- Good.

495
00:28:55,663 --> 00:28:57,753
Are you good, yeah? You
helping mommy make some dinner?

496
00:28:58,738 --> 00:29:00,363
All right.

497
00:29:03,358 --> 00:29:05,189
Is everything okay? Do you
need help with anything?

498
00:29:05,246 --> 00:29:08,616
Yeah, you cannot act like
an a-Hole tonight at dinner.

499
00:29:09,077 --> 00:29:11,316
Now why would I act like
an a-Hole at dinner tonight?

500
00:29:11,476 --> 00:29:13,922
Because you were an a-Hole last night.

501
00:29:15,105 --> 00:29:16,903
She's not just your daughter anymore.

502
00:29:16,931 --> 00:29:18,236
Do you know how offensive that was?

503
00:29:18,264 --> 00:29:20,912
Can we put a pin in this,
please? Is that okay with you?

504
00:29:20,978 --> 00:29:24,034
- Okay, fine!
- Hello?

505
00:29:24,767 --> 00:29:26,795
Hi.

506
00:29:27,405 --> 00:29:30,527
Uh, yeah, sure. That's fine.

507
00:29:30,743 --> 00:29:32,025
Positive.

508
00:29:32,147 --> 00:29:34,682
I'm sure. Okay?

509
00:29:34,983 --> 00:29:36,973
All right, we'll see you then.

510
00:29:37,565 --> 00:29:40,410
So, uh, we need to set an
extra plate for dinner tonight.

511
00:29:40,504 --> 00:29:42,659
Maggie's gonna bring George.

512
00:29:43,044 --> 00:29:45,720
Was I supposed to say no to her?

513
00:29:53,086 --> 00:29:55,565
There you are. I'll take that.

514
00:29:56,743 --> 00:29:59,114
- I should go.
- No, stay.

515
00:29:59,311 --> 00:30:01,700
Besides, I should be the one leaving.

516
00:30:05,568 --> 00:30:08,713
You know... Billy has a few
things he needs to say to you,

517
00:30:08,779 --> 00:30:12,868
And who knows, you two may have more
to talk about than you even realize.

518
00:30:17,681 --> 00:30:20,188
Honey, you be sure and
call me later, okay?

519
00:30:20,207 --> 00:30:21,855
- Let me know how it goes.
- Okay, mom.

520
00:30:21,883 --> 00:30:23,413
I'll take this.

521
00:30:25,761 --> 00:30:28,850
- You planned this?
- I-I- I just

522
00:30:28,906 --> 00:30:32,920
Wasn't completely sure if i
made myself clear yesterday.

523
00:30:34,366 --> 00:30:36,263
If there is ever a moment

524
00:30:36,329 --> 00:30:37,770
Anytime in the future,

525
00:30:37,808 --> 00:30:39,601
Whether it's in a hour

526
00:30:39,658 --> 00:30:42,944
Or a month or a year,

527
00:30:43,113 --> 00:30:45,254
When you change your mind

528
00:30:45,301 --> 00:30:47,681
About... you know,

529
00:30:47,878 --> 00:30:49,756
Us,

530
00:30:50,235 --> 00:30:52,202
I want you to know that
I would be open to that.

531
00:30:52,258 --> 00:30:54,535
You used your mother to ambush me?

532
00:30:54,611 --> 00:30:56,592
It wasn't an ambush exactly.

533
00:30:56,629 --> 00:31:00,127
- I am so out of here.
- Look, I know, I know!

534
00:31:01,165 --> 00:31:03,864
I just didn't want you

535
00:31:04,334 --> 00:31:05,996
Out there in the world

536
00:31:06,202 --> 00:31:08,169
Not knowing how I feel.

537
00:31:08,348 --> 00:31:09,986
Okay, I get it.

538
00:31:10,071 --> 00:31:11,442
I know how you feel,

539
00:31:12,042 --> 00:31:15,000
But that is never going to happen.

540
00:31:15,902 --> 00:31:18,207
You know beyond any doubt

541
00:31:18,366 --> 00:31:20,878
That you're never going to
feel that way about me again?

542
00:31:20,925 --> 00:31:23,202
Pretty much, yeah.

543
00:31:32,653 --> 00:31:35,446
how can you know how
you're going to feel in the future?

544
00:31:35,512 --> 00:31:37,503
I mean, how can anybody know that?

545
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:39,855
God, I've gotta go.

546
00:31:39,873 --> 00:31:42,052
- Claire, Claire...
- To the bathroom.

547
00:31:43,587 --> 00:31:45,550
- ... Don't leave me.
- I won't.

548
00:31:45,596 --> 00:31:48,047
I'm just gonna run to the
ladies' room for a second.

549
00:31:48,066 --> 00:31:51,324
- I'll be right back. Okay?
- Okay.

550
00:32:12,967 --> 00:32:15,888
You told him about
our situation at home?

551
00:32:16,005 --> 00:32:18,967
I didn't go into details, no.

552
00:32:19,371 --> 00:32:21,451
But he's the principal
at our son's school.

553
00:32:21,517 --> 00:32:25,118
And he was looking for some sort
of explanation for julio's behavior.

554
00:32:25,362 --> 00:32:27,967
- He was very concerned.
- He is?

555
00:32:28,033 --> 00:32:30,442
He said our divorce is
causing julio to lash out,

556
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:32,667
And frankly, he's surprised
that it hasn't caused him

557
00:32:32,686 --> 00:32:35,273
More problems than it already has.

558
00:32:35,488 --> 00:32:38,000
He did?

559
00:32:38,169 --> 00:32:40,343
He was very sympathetic.

560
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:47,033
It's been hard for me, Rico.
The boys are getting older,

561
00:32:47,061 --> 00:32:49,456
I'm doing this alone.

562
00:32:50,188 --> 00:32:52,972
But I didn't realize there
was that much of a problem.

563
00:32:53,179 --> 00:32:55,014
It's okay.

564
00:32:55,305 --> 00:32:57,600
I'm on top of it.

565
00:32:58,254 --> 00:33:01,100
We're on top of it.

566
00:33:03,263 --> 00:33:06,643
Who is at the door? Who is at this door?

567
00:33:06,672 --> 00:33:09,310
- Grandpa and Maggie.
- Yeah!

568
00:33:09,648 --> 00:33:11,235
- Hey, you guys, come on in.
- Hi.

569
00:33:11,531 --> 00:33:14,338
Hey! Oh, thank you.

570
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:17,700
- Good to see you.
- George, welcome.

571
00:33:18,357 --> 00:33:20,080
- I hope it's okay I brought my dad.
- Oh, of course.

572
00:33:20,099 --> 00:33:20,981
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

573
00:33:21,019 --> 00:33:22,953
Please don't talk about
me like I'm not here.

574
00:33:23,038 --> 00:33:25,362
Now I just, uh, want to say...

575
00:33:25,427 --> 00:33:27,592
If Nate and I seem a
little tense tonight,

576
00:33:27,639 --> 00:33:29,479
It's, uh, it has nothing to do with you.

577
00:33:29,507 --> 00:33:31,568
- Hey, Brenda!
- We've been having a fight.

578
00:33:31,596 --> 00:33:33,028
- A fight?
- Yes.

579
00:33:33,057 --> 00:33:34,427
No, we haven't been having a fight.

580
00:33:34,446 --> 00:33:36,812
- We just had a disagreement.
- What about?

581
00:33:36,911 --> 00:33:39,493
- Dad!
- It's about when Maya should-

582
00:33:39,531 --> 00:33:41,728
Brenda, maybe we should do this
when there's no company here.

583
00:33:41,765 --> 00:33:43,981
You're right, it's not important.

584
00:33:44,066 --> 00:33:47,587
But if you feel a
weird energy in the air,

585
00:33:47,709 --> 00:33:50,714
It's us. It has nothing to do with you.

586
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:53,869
Shall we start on the white?

587
00:33:54,169 --> 00:33:57,643
- Please.
- Maggie.

588
00:34:00,244 --> 00:34:04,564
So if he's more or less all
better, why can't you leave him?

589
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:06,765
I can't do that.

590
00:34:06,878 --> 00:34:09,550
The way he looks at me, I just see
the little boy in him, you know?

591
00:34:09,897 --> 00:34:12,174
That's always been my problem with men.

592
00:34:12,287 --> 00:34:14,639
It doesn't matter if they're 10 or 80.

593
00:34:14,695 --> 00:34:17,817
I see them... standing there

594
00:34:17,902 --> 00:34:20,920
Like children in short pants.

595
00:34:21,648 --> 00:34:24,136
Just... skinny little boys, lost.

596
00:34:24,315 --> 00:34:27,512
Why do I always pick men
with such skinny legs?

597
00:34:28,423 --> 00:34:30,348
I'm a horrible train wreck of a person.

598
00:34:30,404 --> 00:34:32,620
Oh, you are not a horrible train wreck!

599
00:34:32,667 --> 00:34:34,451
- I am.
- You're not, you're human.

600
00:34:34,855 --> 00:34:36,911
And there's a limit to
how much you can take!

601
00:34:36,939 --> 00:34:38,667
But I made a vow to this man!

602
00:34:38,841 --> 00:34:42,343
- Oh god, she feels everything so deeply.
- Ruth,

603
00:34:42,606 --> 00:34:45,756
Marriage, especially to someone
who is making you miserable,

604
00:34:45,775 --> 00:34:48,352
Does not have to mean
till death do you part.

605
00:34:48,404 --> 00:34:51,010
But he's sweet... and ill.

606
00:34:51,122 --> 00:34:54,150
He lives with me in my house and
he can't even take care of himself.

607
00:34:54,273 --> 00:34:55,672
What about his daughter Maggie?

608
00:34:55,728 --> 00:34:57,972
She has her own life to live.

609
00:35:00,244 --> 00:35:02,000
Let me tell you something.

610
00:35:02,094 --> 00:35:03,798
I had a friend once,

611
00:35:03,845 --> 00:35:05,972
A romantic friend,

612
00:35:06,169 --> 00:35:08,761
And he had a very bad
problem with alcohol.

613
00:35:08,808 --> 00:35:11,465
- Oh god!
- So you know what I did?

614
00:35:11,709 --> 00:35:14,169
- What?
- I dried him out.

615
00:35:14,310 --> 00:35:17,141
I called everybody I could think of,

616
00:35:17,226 --> 00:35:20,479
I got him a job, I got him an apartment.

617
00:35:20,686 --> 00:35:22,878
And when I was sure he was safe,

618
00:35:22,944 --> 00:35:24,812
I cut him loose.

619
00:35:25,780 --> 00:35:28,474
I could never do that.

620
00:35:32,318 --> 00:35:33,859
That was a lovely dinner,

621
00:35:34,583 --> 00:35:37,356
Even if it was prepared
under trying circumstances.

622
00:35:37,579 --> 00:35:40,179
- It was delicious.
- Thank you.

623
00:35:40,573 --> 00:35:43,584
- How's she?
- She's out like a light.

624
00:35:43,682 --> 00:35:46,803
That little girl can fall
asleep at the drop of a hat.

625
00:35:47,494 --> 00:35:49,735
Most of the time.

626
00:35:49,841 --> 00:35:53,346
Well...Whatever you two were arguing
about earlier seems to have blown over.

627
00:35:56,534 --> 00:35:58,050
It wasn't an argument really.

628
00:35:58,138 --> 00:36:00,907
We were just discussing the
possibility of telling Maya

629
00:36:00,973 --> 00:36:02,710
That Brenda is not her
biological mother.

630
00:36:02,776 --> 00:36:05,116
- She doesn't remember Lisa?

631
00:36:06,369 --> 00:36:08,611
No, I don't know. It's

632
00:36:09,099 --> 00:36:12,237
She's barely walking.
How can you know for sure?

633
00:36:12,457 --> 00:36:15,314
I think she's old enough
to know her story,

634
00:36:15,874 --> 00:36:18,402
And how I came to be her mommy.

635
00:36:18,479 --> 00:36:21,424
You know, there's something I've
always wanted to ask.

636
00:36:21,501 --> 00:36:22,380
Yeah?

637
00:36:22,468 --> 00:36:24,885
Lisa's brother-In-Law,
what was his name?

638
00:36:25,314 --> 00:36:26,743
Hoyt.

639
00:36:27,083 --> 00:36:30,863
Did they ever determine for certain
if he was involved in Lisa's death?

640
00:36:30,973 --> 00:36:33,171
- Dad
- No no, it's all right. It's okay.

641
00:36:37,023 --> 00:36:39,215
Look, with both Lisa and hoyt dead,

642
00:36:39,303 --> 00:36:41,127
They don't know for sure.

643
00:36:42,193 --> 00:36:43,787
And no one ever will.

644
00:36:44,017 --> 00:36:46,765
- But you think you know what happened?
- I think that's enough.

645
00:36:46,918 --> 00:36:49,732
Yes I am pretty sure
I know  happen

646
00:36:49,787 --> 00:36:52,083
Because I think knowing what
happened is really important.

647
00:36:52,171 --> 00:36:54,182
In fact, knowing what
happens is crucial.

648
00:36:54,270 --> 00:36:55,523
I said I think I know what happened.

649
00:36:55,764 --> 00:36:57,940
Do you feel you have
closure about the all?

650
00:36:58,072 --> 00:37:00,665
- As a matter of fact, no, I don't have closure.
- George!

651
00:37:02,083 --> 00:37:04,324
I think we should change the subject.

652
00:37:07,138 --> 00:37:08,742
Oh, I'm sorry.

653
00:37:08,978 --> 00:37:11,665
My medication makes me feel a little wonky.

654
00:37:11,709 --> 00:37:14,258
And if I get a thought
or question in my head,

655
00:37:14,313 --> 00:37:16,203
It keeps going round and
round like it's caught

656
00:37:16,247 --> 00:37:18,555
In some kind of endless loop.

657
00:37:18,753 --> 00:37:20,159
Sorry.

658
00:37:20,390 --> 00:37:22,467
It's not a problem.

659
00:37:25,961 --> 00:37:28,005
Here's to our baby.

660
00:37:32,203 --> 00:37:34,291
Is this alcoholic?

661
00:37:34,412 --> 00:37:35,994
No, it's just sparkling cider.

662
00:37:36,049 --> 00:37:38,775
Too bad. My ob-Gyn says it's okay

663
00:37:38,929 --> 00:37:42,239
To have a glass or two of red wine
Up until the second trimestery.

664
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:46,324
- Really?
- Listen, I don't wanna worry you guys or anything,

665
00:37:46,642 --> 00:37:49,786
But I woke up this morning
with a tiny bit of spotting.

666
00:37:49,836 --> 00:37:51,880
Which is nothing to worry about,

667
00:37:51,979 --> 00:37:54,154
I spotted through all
my other pregnancies.

668
00:37:54,253 --> 00:37:57,770
Besides, I'm still having my cravings
for meat so I just know I'm pregnant.

669
00:37:58,253 --> 00:38:01,396
- You're sure?
- Spotting is par for the course.

670
00:38:01,891 --> 00:38:04,550
Besides, my boobs are so sore,

671
00:38:04,607 --> 00:38:06,506
I can hardly put on a bra.

672
00:38:06,567 --> 00:38:08,677
That's why I'm not wearing one.

673
00:38:09,982 --> 00:38:12,443
- Is there any more lox?
- Yeah.

674
00:38:15,362 --> 00:38:17,509
<i>Why would you sign
it if it's not a loan?</i>

675
00:38:17,575 --> 00:38:20,278
<i>- Either you sold a car to him
- You don't understand english?</i>

676
00:38:20,475 --> 00:38:22,641
<i>- Excuse me?
- I just said-</i>

677
00:38:22,704 --> 00:38:24,533
<i>All right, baby, I don't
understand things.</i>

678
00:38:24,561 --> 00:38:26,488
<i>- Okay.
- I just don't understand liars.</i>

679
00:38:28,471 --> 00:38:29,990
Getting high in the morning ?

680
00:38:36,911 --> 00:38:38,768
Mom wants me to get a job.

681
00:38:39,942 --> 00:38:41,475
Can you believe that?

682
00:38:41,693 --> 00:38:44,310
We all have to work, Claire.
We all have to get a job.

683
00:38:45,146 --> 00:38:48,536
Why can't anyone in this
family just let me fucking be?

684
00:38:53,143 --> 00:38:55,021
Because I just flashed
on Maya at your age

685
00:38:55,065 --> 00:38:57,166
Sitting in front of the tv
feeling sorry for herself...

686
00:38:59,638 --> 00:39:01,751
Not caring about anything or anybody.

687
00:39:04,494 --> 00:39:06,224
It just broke my heart.

688
00:39:18,628 --> 00:39:20,870
Bye, I love you.

689
00:39:21,266 --> 00:39:22,782
- Mrs. Diaz.
- Yeah?

690
00:39:22,826 --> 00:39:27,090
I, was wondering if I might
have a word with you in my office...

691
00:39:28,771 --> 00:39:31,035
- Sure.
- Thank you.

692
00:39:33,606 --> 00:39:35,540
You don't wanna know
what we ended up paying.

693
00:39:35,639 --> 00:39:38,189
- What, for the casket?
- The casket is one thing.

694
00:39:38,266 --> 00:39:40,551
- Then there's everything else on top.
- What everything else?

695
00:39:40,804 --> 00:39:42,760
It's a list as long as my
arm, you don't wanna know.

696
00:39:42,837 --> 00:39:44,859
- Maybe I don't wanna know.
- Believe me, you don't.

697
00:39:44,936 --> 00:39:47,442
But that's what money is
for, for times like this.

698
00:39:47,650 --> 00:39:50,551
God bless him. He was a son
of a bitch, but god bless him.

699
00:39:50,650 --> 00:39:52,331
- Oh, he looks good.
- Thank you.

700
00:39:52,397 --> 00:39:54,771
Bullshit! He doesn't
look good, he looks dead.

701
00:39:54,848 --> 00:39:56,848
He is dead.

702
00:39:56,947 --> 00:39:59,782
So have you guys figured out what
you wanna do with his remains?

703
00:39:59,859 --> 00:40:03,024
Carl and I wanna have him cremated
And scattered off the santa monica pier.

704
00:40:03,540 --> 00:40:05,232
That's where he liked to go fishing.

705
00:40:05,298 --> 00:40:06,903
He told me that's what he wanted.

706
00:40:07,046 --> 00:40:10,496
Your sister is still arguing
for a plot at forest lawn.

707
00:40:10,573 --> 00:40:12,881
Tough shit.

708
00:40:13,749 --> 00:40:15,507
I'm hungry.

709
00:40:15,705 --> 00:40:18,079
Let's go eat some ham balls
before they're all ate up.

710
00:40:21,826 --> 00:40:25,518
No offense, Pal, but your family is
a bunch of fucked up control freaks.

711
00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:28,144
Whose isn't?

712
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,606
I wish you could just
tell me what you want.

713
00:40:31,672 --> 00:40:34,287
You're asking me what I want?

714
00:40:34,419 --> 00:40:36,496
Yeah, it's your funeral.

715
00:40:36,705 --> 00:40:39,452
For 20 years nobody
ever asked me anything.

716
00:40:41,013 --> 00:40:43,353
This is what I want...

717
00:40:44,111 --> 00:40:46,704
I want Maya to have a mommy.

718
00:40:58,101 --> 00:41:00,233
George?

719
00:41:01,101 --> 00:41:03,584
I've been thinking about it a lot

720
00:41:04,035 --> 00:41:06,826
And I think I want us to move out.

721
00:41:08,034 --> 00:41:09,167
Move out of the house?

722
00:41:09,243 --> 00:41:11,551
Yes, I think it would
be best for both of us.

723
00:41:12,397 --> 00:41:14,793
This house is too full of bad memories.

724
00:41:15,045 --> 00:41:17,177
I think we need to make a fresh start.

725
00:41:18,567 --> 00:41:21,012
We could make a fresh start,

726
00:41:21,793 --> 00:41:23,529
Leave all our troubles behind us.

727
00:41:23,672 --> 00:41:25,738
That's right.

728
00:41:28,925 --> 00:41:31,244
What on earth do you think you're doing?

729
00:41:31,439 --> 00:41:33,802
-  Just getting some food.
- Get out of here!

730
00:41:33,870 --> 00:41:36,315
I'm trying to have a private
conversation with my husband.

731
00:41:36,384 --> 00:41:39,406
Get out! Go get a job! Leave now!

732
00:41:47,730 --> 00:41:50,450
I made us an appointment to...

733
00:41:51,068 --> 00:41:53,925
Look at a place near park la brea.

734
00:41:54,296 --> 00:41:56,686
That is within walking
distance of the museums.

735
00:41:56,782 --> 00:41:59,392
And the farmer's market.

736
00:42:01,192 --> 00:42:04,104
Do you really want a new beginning?

737
00:42:04,227 --> 00:42:07,249
Because nothing would make me happier.

738
00:42:18,101 --> 00:42:20,079
- Mary.
- Sorry I didn't buzz,

739
00:42:20,189 --> 00:42:23,238
But some old lady was coming out
the front, so I just slipped inside.

740
00:42:24,497 --> 00:42:26,934
Okay, are you guys sitting down?

741
00:42:28,211 --> 00:42:31,068
- I am.
- Why, what's wrong?

742
00:42:31,137 --> 00:42:34,021
I got my period.
Just about 10 minutes ago.

743
00:42:34,118 --> 00:42:37,249
- I came right over to let you know.
- But you took a test.

744
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:40,944
- Didn't you?
- No.

745
00:42:41,222 --> 00:42:43,145
- Oh.
- I'm really sorry, you guys,

746
00:42:44,313 --> 00:42:46,717
But actually, it's probably a good
thing, cause I did just get a new set,

747
00:42:46,812 --> 00:42:50,504
of x-Rays at the dentist last week.
Can I use your bathroom?

748
00:43:06,086 --> 00:43:07,962
Well...

749
00:43:08,390 --> 00:43:11,628
Do you still want to adopt anthony?

750
00:43:17,747 --> 00:43:21,139
You told our son's school principal
that I was dating a drug addict!

751
00:43:21,846 --> 00:43:23,912
I never said drug addict.

752
00:43:24,043 --> 00:43:25,241
What I said was pothead.

753
00:43:25,285 --> 00:43:27,560
Kenny never even tried the stuff, Rico.

754
00:43:27,626 --> 00:43:30,021
That was his sister, and
it was in high school.

755
00:43:30,098 --> 00:43:32,494
And I stopped seeing him months ago.

756
00:43:32,571 --> 00:43:35,054
- I just...
- You also told him
I was on antidepressants?

757
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:37,669
- I said "was. "
- You told him everything about us, Rico!

758
00:43:37,757 --> 00:43:40,042
- I didn't tell him everything!
- He wanted to know

759
00:43:40,153 --> 00:43:43,032
If the trouble with the babysitter
involved any molestation.

760
00:43:43,219 --> 00:43:45,263
I was like, "what babysitter?"

761
00:43:45,537 --> 00:43:47,911
He said he was required by
law to report it to the police,

762
00:43:47,922 --> 00:43:50,669
But that he wanted to give me
an opportunity to do it first.

763
00:43:50,735 --> 00:43:53,999
I never told him molestation.
I said there was an incident.

764
00:43:54,076 --> 00:43:56,867
And there was, you
didn't show up to get him.

765
00:43:57,098 --> 00:43:59,427
What the fuck, Rico?

766
00:44:00,537 --> 00:44:02,823
I thought it would be helpful to bring mr.

767
00:44:02,911 --> 00:44:05,098
Schumacher into the loop of our family situa...

768
00:44:05,164 --> 00:44:07,691
And he never said that
julio's problems at school

769
00:44:08,511 --> 00:44:10,885
Were caused by us being separated.

770
00:44:11,049 --> 00:44:13,577
I was trying to do what's
best for Julio, vanessa.

771
00:44:13,643 --> 00:44:15,753
- You're full of shit!

772
00:44:15,830 --> 00:44:18,973
Lately, I was thinking there might be
a chance we would get back together,

773
00:44:19,093 --> 00:44:21,951
But boy, do I need my
fucking head examined.

774
00:44:25,060 --> 00:44:27,390
I can't believe I ever married
a fucking embalmer!

775
00:44:42,103 --> 00:44:43,994
- Hey.
- Hey.

776
00:44:44,126 --> 00:44:46,610
- How was work?
- It was okay.

777
00:44:48,357 --> 00:44:50,346
Where's Maya?

778
00:44:50,654 --> 00:44:53,698
She's in my closet, putting
stuffed kitties in all my shoes.

779
00:44:58,885 --> 00:45:01,061
Brenda, I'm sorry.

780
00:45:06,214 --> 00:45:08,159
I'm sorry.

781
00:45:09,698 --> 00:45:11,742
What am I supposed to tell her?

782
00:45:12,807 --> 00:45:15,786
That her real mommy got pregnant
and trapped me into marrying her?

783
00:45:17,797 --> 00:45:20,324
That she was fucking her brother-In-Law
and he might have murdered her

784
00:45:20,368 --> 00:45:22,610
Because she tried to break it off?

785
00:45:23,643 --> 00:45:25,995
That he might even be her real dad?

786
00:45:28,060 --> 00:45:30,456
I just wanted to spare
her that, you know?

787
00:45:32,071 --> 00:45:33,800
I wanted to spare me that.

788
00:45:36,502 --> 00:45:38,023
Oh god, Nate, I...

789
00:45:38,726 --> 00:45:40,801
I didn't even think of any of that.

790
00:45:54,185 --> 00:45:56,986
You know, we can be honest with
Maya about Lisa being the mother

791
00:45:57,047 --> 00:45:59,333
Without having to go through every...

792
00:45:59,711 --> 00:46:01,645
Detail.

793
00:46:04,854 --> 00:46:06,726
But someday-

794
00:46:08,493 --> 00:46:10,911
Someday she might need to know.

795
00:46:12,313 --> 00:46:14,225
But not now.

796
00:46:14,375 --> 00:46:16,397
Not for a long time.

797
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:40,228
Well, his mother's in rehab and his
father's whereabouts are unknown.

798
00:46:40,590 --> 00:46:42,788
His school work is a little...

799
00:46:42,876 --> 00:46:45,162
Below average.

800
00:46:46,293 --> 00:46:47,370
He's a good kid.

801
00:46:47,436 --> 00:46:49,854
He's very sensitive, very sweet.

802
00:46:52,964 --> 00:46:55,447
You know he has an older sibling.

803
00:46:55,634 --> 00:46:57,634
- No.
- No, we didn't.

804
00:46:58,524 --> 00:47:00,898
Yeah, his name is Durrell.

805
00:47:01,799 --> 00:47:04,000
- How old is he?
- Eleven.

806
00:47:06,030 --> 00:47:09,964
You know we do prefer to try
to keep siblings together.

807
00:47:17,140 --> 00:47:19,713
So when do we meet Durrell?

808
00:47:21,911 --> 00:47:24,900
You know something? I like it.

809
00:47:26,925 --> 00:47:29,686
I think we could be very
happy here, don't you?

810
00:47:30,191 --> 00:47:32,351
Yes, George, I thought
you would like it here.

811
00:47:32,392 --> 00:47:34,919
Oh, I already do.

812
00:47:38,041 --> 00:47:42,539
So here we are: dad and mom...

813
00:47:42,659 --> 00:47:46,625
And you. Can you turn the page for me?

814
00:47:47,631 --> 00:47:49,609
And this is Lisa.

815
00:47:49,675 --> 00:47:51,917
She was your first mommy,

816
00:47:52,081 --> 00:47:55,158
- Your biological momy.
- And that means that you lived there.

817
00:47:55,488 --> 00:47:57,049
- Yeah.
- In her belly.

818
00:47:57,213 --> 00:47:58,696
For nine whole months.
How about that?

819
00:47:58,801 --> 00:48:01,983
Just like your new brother or sister
is living in your momma's belly now.

820
00:48:03,477 --> 00:48:05,488
And she loved you.

821
00:48:05,554 --> 00:48:07,906
She loved you very much.

822
00:48:10,466 --> 00:48:12,752
Now put a sticker?
