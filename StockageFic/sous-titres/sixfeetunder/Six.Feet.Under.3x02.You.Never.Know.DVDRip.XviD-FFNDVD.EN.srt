1
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:24,094
Hello? Hello?

2
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:26,893
- Hi. May I speak with Joe Marti, please?
- Speaking.

3
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:29,818
- Glad I caught you.
- Is this a sales call?

4
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:33,978
I wanted to let you know that a
representative from Americatech Windows...

5
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:37,729
- I'm not interested.
- There's no obligation to buy.

6
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:41,455
- Look, I said no.
- We're offering interest-free...

7
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:44,412
Hey. Goodbye, asshole.

8
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:47,611
Fuckl He's got a gunl

9
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:49,971
Get down!

10
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:53,691
Hey, remember me?

11
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:12,575
Daniel, what the hell... Oh, my God.

12
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:16,378
- Please. No. Please.
- Fuck you.

13
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:52,049
Hello?

14
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:30,778
- This is OK?
- Yeah.

15
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:35,093
- You sure you're comfortable?
- Aren't you?

16
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:39,292
- Do you wanna get on top?
- I don't have to. You want me to?

17
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:41,900
If you want to. But I'm fine like this.

18
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:48,495
Maya's right there.

19
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:51,054
- She's not looking.
- I know, but...

20
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:53,091
- Hi, this is Lisa.
- And Nate.

21
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:56,735
And Maya. Come on, sweetie.

22
00:04:56,780 --> 00:05:00,329
And we're the Fisher family.
Leave a message.

23
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:03,531
Hi, Lisa, it's Carol.
Please pick up if you're there.

24
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:11,050
I don' t know where else you could be.
Both your cars are in my driveway.

25
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:13,660
Listen, I need muffins.

26
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:19,138
Corn muffins. I have an intense craving
for miniature corn muffins.

27
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:22,855
Please! This is my one hour a day to eat carbs.

28
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:25,255
Shut up!

29
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:29,134
- Stop ignoring me.
- Don't make her the muffins.

30
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:32,297
- Don't make her the muffins.
- Hello?

31
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:48,249
That's great.

32
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:54,769
David.

33
00:05:57,700 --> 00:06:00,089
David. It's a little early.

34
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:04,452
Sorry. I wanna make sure I get it right.
Some of the guys in this chorus are so good.

35
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:08,209
- One of them recorded with Chanticleer.
- You sound great.

36
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:12,094
- I even dreamed about singing last night.
- You weren't just dreaming.

37
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:18,330
- Oh, God. Punch me next time.
- I did.

38
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:23,931
- What happened to your uniform?
- I tore it getting a Frisbee out of a tree.

39
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:26,733
- Why were you...
- That's what security guards do.

40
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:28,771
We help people.

41
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:36,213
- I'm leaving.
- Would you like beef blast pizza rolls?

42
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:40,131
- I doubt it.
- Me neither.

43
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:42,853
But with a double coupon it's practically free.

44
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:44,970
Maybe the boys will like them.

45
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:49,933
- I may not be home tonight.
- Take a sweater.

46
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:55,697
You've reached the Fisher family.
Leave a message.

47
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:57,890
Ruth, are you there?

48
00:06:57,940 --> 00:07:01,853
It's Sarah. I'm just checking up on you.

49
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:04,095
I know what a drag it is to be out of work.

50
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:08,019
I thought you might
wanna come up to Topanga for the day.

51
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:12,576
I could make some of Aunt May's
German potato salad. I know you liked that.

52
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:15,054
Call me. Bye.

53
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:19,092
You liked her potato salad. I hated it.

54
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:29,019
Just... It just never occurs to you...

55
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:33,699
that a madman will walk
into your husband's office

56
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:38,654
and suddenly, he's gone.

57
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:41,974
No, of course not.

58
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,650
And then there's telling the children.

59
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:48,375
We have two girls.

60
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:51,173
12 and 16.

61
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:56,332
What shall I say to them,
to make them feel better?

62
00:07:57,780 --> 00:07:59,179
What?

63
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:05,534
Well, you could...

64
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:10,253
- Hello.
- Glad you could make it.

65
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:14,851
- Nate, this is Dorothy Milne.
- Nate Fisher.

66
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:16,538
That's my partner.

67
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:20,049
I'm very sorry about your husband.

68
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:24,651
I know those are just words.

69
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:30,573
But we'll work together with you
to give him a fitting tribute.

70
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:32,656
Thank you.

71
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:35,893
Everything's already been taken care of.

72
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:39,249
- We're done.
- OK.

73
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:42,976
Let me walk you to your car.

74
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:59,494
I didn't even go to my prom.
If somebody asked me, I'd have freaked out.

75
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:03,613
I took Nancy Pollard.
She smelled like fried chicken.

76
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:06,413
- Why?
- I don't know. She just did.

77
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:13,649
I got a bottle of champagne
with my friend Parker

78
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:16,817
and we climbed the fence to school
and just sat in the quad

79
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:20,853
and got drunk
and said good-fucking-bye to high school.

80
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:24,131
- Nice.
- Then we both started crying.

81
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:26,372
Why?

82
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:30,488
I don't know.

83
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:34,613
I guess we were saying goodbye
to our childhood or whatever.

84
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:37,379
It just seemed sad.

85
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:44,615
- Yeah.
- I hated fucking high school.

86
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:50,819
But still, it was my life and it was all I knew.

87
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:52,930
It was just over.

88
00:09:56,540 --> 00:10:01,295
- God, could I be any more pathetic?
- You're not pathetic.

89
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:05,299
- You're just sensitive.
- I know. I'm too sensitive.

90
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:08,457
No. You're perfect.

91
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:15,291
What time do you have to get up?

92
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:21,936
I'm gonna have to get up in three hours.
I haven't done the assignment yet.

93
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:24,699
- You keep distracting me.
- I do?

94
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:28,813
Yeah, my hands are
magnetically drawn to your dick.

95
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:30,532
What is the assignment?

96
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:36,818
I have to read and critique
some theoretical conceptual bullshit.

97
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:41,092
They make you take all the boring classes
before they let you do anything cool with clay.

98
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:43,017
I know exactly how you feel.

99
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:46,257
- No, you don't.
- That's why I dropped out of music school.

100
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:48,939
All I wanted to do was write great music.

101
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:53,770
But they had me studying all this shit
that had nothing to do with anything.

102
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:58,689
They try to programme your mind
so you're exactly like everyone else.

103
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:02,929
Don't let them do that to you.
You're too talented.

104
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:08,209
- You think so?
- What?

105
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:13,334
You think I like you just cos
you have the softest skin I've ever felt?

106
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:14,972
I don't know.

107
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:18,129
You're amazing, Claire.

108
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:28,449
- Hello, beautiful ladies.
- Good morning.

109
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,730
Thank you for letting me sleep in.

110
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:35,496
- Does your brother like eggplant?
- I don't know.

111
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:38,531
I guess.

112
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:42,334
I figured we could grill some salmon tonight.
I just don't know what else.

113
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:44,848
- Is that tonight?
- Yes.

114
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:47,778
- Can we cancel?
- It was your idea.

115
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:51,335
I know. Sounded good at the time, but...

116
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:55,817
I see David at work every day. It's not like
I'm dying to spend quality time with Keith.

117
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:57,851
You wanted David to see Maya.

118
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:01,451
OK, you're right. We'll do it.

119
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:06,128
Your Uncle David's coming over.
Won't that be fun?

120
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:08,330
Yeah. Yeah.

121
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:11,577
Try it once more. Please.

122
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:15,649
Try it once more.

123
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:18,331
Great. Thank you.

124
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:23,172
- Lisa, you're being careful?
- I'm being very delicate.

125
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:25,211
Hey, Maya.

126
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:34,339
- I think you're going too deep.
- Nate, you worry too much.

127
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:36,530
Just because you deal with people dying.

128
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:40,175
Sometimes after you clean her ears
she doesn't respond as quickly.

129
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:42,211
- You think I've injured her?
- No.

130
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:45,775
Maybe there's some ringing in her ears
after you've cleaned them.

131
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:49,017
Nate, I know whether my child can hear or not,
and she can hear.

132
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:51,938
- She's been tested and she can hear.
- Right.

133
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:54,255
- Your child?
- I didn't mean...

134
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:56,973
I'm just the father,
but I'm every bit as committed.

135
00:12:57,020 --> 00:12:59,534
- Nate.
- I'm just trying to help.

136
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:02,174
I need to work.

137
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:12,777
You've reached the Fisher family.
Please leave a message.

138
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:15,812
Ruth, it's Sarah.

139
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:19,170
I am disappointed you didn't call back.

140
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:22,496
I'll be honest. I was trying
to trick you into coming out here.

141
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:24,815
I need you.

142
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:27,658
I hurt my back and I'm all alone...

143
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:32,615
- What did you do?
- I fell off a ladder.

144
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:37,415
- Have you seen a doctor?
- He told me to stay in bed.

145
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:39,928
He gave me a prescription for Vicodin.

146
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:42,616
What do you need me to do?

147
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:45,015
Pick it up for me.

148
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:47,096
Give me the address of the pharmacy.

149
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:51,053
Oh, Ruth. I knew I could count on you.

150
00:13:58,140 --> 00:14:00,779
- Are you doing this with me?
- Yes.

151
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:05,013
I can do it myself, David.

152
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:08,939
I'm sure that's true, but Nate and I
find it's helpful to have two people.

153
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:11,971
Why? So one of you can sleep late?

154
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:19,049
And of course we'll place
an obituary notice in the paper.

155
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:20,533
No.

156
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:25,937
We'd like to keep this private
and as simple as possible.

157
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:29,534
You see this kind of thing on TV

158
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:33,892
and you think,
"Oh, my God, those poor people."

159
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:41,656
But now it's happening to us
and we have to see it...

160
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:45,134
every time we turn on.

161
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:51,251
Thank you.

162
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:55,329
We knew that Daniel was a troubled boy

163
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:58,531
but we really thought he was getting better.

164
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:02,179
Your son isn't the one who did the shooting?

165
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:05,168
- Yes.
- I'm sorry.

166
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:09,577
- We can't possibly...
- Imagine what you must be going through.

167
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:13,339
But you can rest assured
we will do everything we can

168
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:15,450
to help you through this dark time.

169
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:18,379
Thank you.

170
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:24,938
Fisher and Sons has never turned down
a funeral and neither will Fisher and Diaz.

171
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:29,292
That's great. When Dorothy Milne
is crying over her husband's casket,

172
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:33,253
I'll tell her you're next door arranging flowers
round the man who killed him.

173
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:36,849
The services will be on different days.
There will be no conflict.

174
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:40,973
Come on. I know you like to make a buck
but isn't this going a little far?

175
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:43,580
That's got nothing to do with it.

176
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:46,180
The funeral is for the living, not the deceased.

177
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:48,654
Really? Yeah, I read the same book as you.

178
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:54,658
Do you think Mr and Mrs Showalter
are in any less pain than Dorothy Milne?

179
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:56,497
Maybe I don't give a shit.

180
00:15:56,540 --> 00:16:00,249
If they'd raised their kid better
he may not have killed those people.

181
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:03,929
- Rico, you can't blame them.
- Yes, I can blame them, and I do.

182
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:13,696
Whether you like it or not, this is your job.
You have to put your feelings aside.

183
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:17,574
- I need you to pick up his body.
- Fuck you. You pick it up.

184
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:19,611
I got nothing to do with this.

185
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:46,417
Hello, I'm Ruth, Sarah's sister.

186
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:51,056
If you got here five minutes ago
you could have cleaned up her puke.

187
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:53,455
I'm Bettina. Come on in.

188
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:58,538
Sarah, your sister's here.

189
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:10,810
- Ruth.
- My goodness, you look awful.

190
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:14,294
Bettina, can we have a moment alone?

191
00:17:14,340 --> 00:17:18,777
- Why?
- She's my sister and we need to talk.

192
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:20,412
What's in the bag?

193
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:24,135
- It's just...
- Some things I asked her to bring for me.

194
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:27,939
Lip balm, hair clips, strawberries.

195
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:29,777
- No...
- Fork it over.

196
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:34,056
Help me, I'm being held hostage...

197
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:37,410
Shut your mouth or I'll goddamn tape it shut!

198
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:40,497
- Goodness, what's going on?
- Ruth, please!

199
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:44,977
Do I have to carry you back to bed
or are you gonna walk by yourself?

200
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:52,971
Bitch.

201
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:58,499
- Give me the bag.
- It's her Vicodin. She has a prescription.

202
00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:03,375
Of course. She has Vicodin prescriptions
in half the pharmacies in LA.

203
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:09,657
Your sister's into her second day of withdrawal.

204
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:12,931
She begged me to make sure
she got through it. No matter what.

205
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:16,338
Fuck that. I was high.

206
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:22,092
I'm sorry, Keith,
I'm having problems at the morgue.

207
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:25,655
- Why didn't you call before?
- I didn't know it'd take so long.

208
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:29,488
- I'm sorry.
- Fine. Whatever.

209
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:31,531
I'll see you tonight.

210
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:35,654
He can't make it.
I'm sorry for wasting your time.

211
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:38,737
You don't need to leave. You and I can talk.

212
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:45,858
- We can do that?
- Sure. Why not?

213
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:57,933
Tell me about that phone call.
How did it make you feel?

214
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:03,895
Pissed off. But I'm working
on my anger management technique.

215
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:07,012
- I'm taking a lot of deep breaths.
- That's good.

216
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:10,574
Have you been feeling a lot of anger
toward David?

217
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:15,011
I've been giving myself so many damn
time-outs, I haven't been feeling anything.

218
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:17,858
Maybe this is a good time
to let some of that anger out.

219
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:20,778
I'm fine.

220
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:25,979
Pretend David's sitting there next to you.
What do you wanna say to him?

221
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:30,131
Anything that comes to mind.

222
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:38,295
Relax. Stop trying so hard.
You're making me nervous.

223
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:44,612
What other things would you like to tell him
that you don't like about him?

224
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:54,298
I hate your stupid little buckwheat pillow.

225
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:57,013
And I hate your nose spray.

226
00:19:57,060 --> 00:20:02,976
I hate the way you eat. You put your fork down
after every bite like you're some prince.

227
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:06,572
I hate the way you want to sleep
with your head on my shoulder.

228
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:08,611
Your head is heavy.

229
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:14,615
I hate the way you make me feel like my father
by letting me walk all over you.

230
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:21,210
What?

231
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:25,456
I always thought by being gay
I'd avoid fucking my mother

232
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:28,173
but I guess that's not the case.

233
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:33,178
Have you thought
about seeing a therapist on your own?

234
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:45,617
- This is great.
- It's my polenta. You like it?

235
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:48,049
- It's delicious.
- Thank you.

236
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:55,089
- Hello.
- Hi. It's Carol.

237
00:20:57,820 --> 00:20:59,412
- Hello.
- Lisa.

238
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:03,419
I'm at Mark and Pam's place in the mountains.
Their cook knows nothing.

239
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:07,009
- Walk them through your basil vinaigrette.
- Right now?

240
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:09,051
Yes. The salad's waiting.

241
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:14,296
- What?
- I gotta deal with this.

242
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:17,616
- Go ahead. I'll start the grill.
- I still have laundry to do.

243
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:19,776
I'll do it. Go.

244
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:22,459
- Lisa?
- Hey, Lise.

245
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:24,616
- Lisal
- I'm sorry about this morning.

246
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:26,651
- Me too.
- Are you still there?

247
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:29,817
I worry about Maya.
I get scared something will go wrong.

248
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:32,499
- Nothing's gonna go wrong.
- Salad dressing.

249
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:34,610
I know. Maya has the best mom in the world.

250
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:36,252
Hello?

251
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:39,251
I need dressing.

252
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:42,497
I mean, Gabe was definitely exciting.

253
00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:48,773
In kind of a sick way. But I think Phil's
the only guy who's ever really understood me.

254
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:53,336
That's cool. Not even my imaginary friends
understand me.

255
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:55,940
Maybe they do, they just don't like me.

256
00:21:55,980 --> 00:22:00,531
- You need better imaginary friends.
- They're the best I can do.

257
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:03,458
So what do you really like about this guy?

258
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:07,968
I don't know. He's sweet.

259
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:11,216
- He's hot.
- Nice.

260
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:13,854
- He's got his own band.
- It's Keanu Reeves.

261
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:15,094
Exactly.

262
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:20,373
You know what... Come on, Claire,
those are superficial things.

263
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:26,813
And you seem anything but superficial.
What do you really like about him?

264
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:33,776
Well, I like the way he treats me.

265
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:35,811
You know, he makes me feel good.

266
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:37,816
Like I'm kind of OK.

267
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:43,495
Like I'm smart and talented and pretty.

268
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:48,855
Uh-oh. I'm totally embarrassed now.

269
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:51,733
No. Women tell me
this kind of thing all the time.

270
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:53,930
I'm the guy who listens.

271
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:56,175
Yeah, you do listen.

272
00:22:57,340 --> 00:22:59,331
That's really nice about you.

273
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:02,850
- I really like talking to you.
- I like listening to you.

274
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:07,690
I hope it could go both ways. If you're dating
anyone, you can totally talk to me.

275
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:10,891
Thanks, but no, I'm not dating. No dating.

276
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:12,931
I think I'm kind of allergic.

277
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:17,770
I start itching
and I swell up and bleed profusely.

278
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:23,699
No, it sounds really nice
having somebody in your life

279
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:25,856
that makes you hate yourself less.

280
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:29,370
- I could use that.
- Come on. I mean, you're great.

281
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:33,254
- I wasn't fishing.
- I'm serious, Russell. I think you're great.

282
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:36,815
Tell me that when it's two in the morning
and I'm laying in bed

283
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:39,738
and I'm eating my fourth bowl of cereal

284
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:46,128
and I'm beating myself up for some stupid thing
I said in eighth grade.

285
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:49,578
- What kind of cereal?
- Captain Crunch.

286
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:52,259
My God. I think we're twins.

287
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:03,494
This whole "Oops, I'm pregnant" thing
still sounds kind of suspicious to me.

288
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:06,100
I'm just surprised he married her.

289
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:09,177
If Nate's happy, that's all I care about.

290
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:13,889
You're still mad at me?
I'm really sorry I missed therapy.

291
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:17,216
No. I was happy you weren't there.
Frank was too.

292
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:19,857
Frank loves me.

293
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:22,812
Yeah, but he thinks
you got a lot of work to do on yourself.

294
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:27,570
That's so not true.
Maybe it's true but he'd never say that.

295
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:30,891
Did you talk about me the whole time?

296
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:34,774
After we decided you were
a hopeless passive-aggressive guilt sponge

297
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:37,459
and we decided to move on
to more important things.

298
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:40,617
God, I'm never gonna miss therapy again.

299
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:42,651
I bet you won't, bitch.

300
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:52,217
Well, hello.

301
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:57,254
- Hey, Nate.
- Hey, Dave. How are you?

302
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:59,530
- Hey, guys.
- Keith, good to see you.

303
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:08,697
I used to burn the fuck out of everything
until I discovered the miracle of low, even heat.

304
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:15,299
The secret is mesquite wood chips.
Do you use mesquite?

305
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:21,255
That's just a gimmick. It's the marinade
that makes all the difference.

306
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:23,894
- I just like wearing the apron.
- Nate.

307
00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:29,936
Where did you put her blue blankie?
She can't sleep without it.

308
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:32,938
- I didn't put it anywhere.
- I couldn't find it.

309
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:37,178
- Did you give her Mr Fat Fanny?
- He's in her sweet little hands.

310
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:38,938
All right.

311
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:43,451
I think we're ready.

312
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:47,379
Good. Let me go wash up.
Where's your little boys' room?

313
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:52,534
The bathroom is in the back
behind the kitchen.

314
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:56,368
Don't flush the toilet.
We don't wanna wake Maya.

315
00:25:56,420 --> 00:25:58,615
So how's the choir going?

316
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:02,969
Well, it's not a choir, it's a chorus,
but it's going well.

317
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:05,329
Great. Can't wait to hear you.

318
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:09,455
- No eggplant for me.
- I'll take his.

319
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:13,495
- Want mozzarella?
- Yes.

320
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:57,619
- Great.
- I'll go.

321
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:04,371
- What did I miss?
- You woke the baby.

322
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:06,695
- It wasn't asleep.
- Yes, it was.

323
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:09,091
It wasn't. It looked at me when I went in.

324
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:14,168
- I told him not to flush.
- David said he had that irritable bowel thing.

325
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:18,938
- Why did you tell him that?
- It just came up.

326
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:21,210
Please, don't discuss my private stuff.

327
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:24,093
- I'm sorry.
- We'll never get her back to sleep.

328
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:27,655
- By the way, I only peed.
- You shouldn't have flushed.

329
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:32,091
- It wasn't asleep.
- Maya, row the boat ashore

330
00:27:32,140 --> 00:27:35,291
Hallelujah

331
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:38,810
Maya, row the boat ashore

332
00:27:38,860 --> 00:27:42,614
Hallelujah

333
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:45,777
My brothers and sisters are all aboard

334
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:49,290
That song has never
sounded so creepy before.

335
00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:52,855
- My brothers and sisters are all aboard
- I know.

336
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:55,539
- Hallelujah
- My goodness.

337
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:16,732
You gotta be kidding me.

338
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:20,568
- What's he doing here?
- Wasn't my idea.

339
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:24,054
Look at you in your fancy fucking suit.

340
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:27,536
- I knew I never should have hired you.
- You shouldn't have fired me.

341
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:30,174
- You were a fuck-up.
- Jesus.

342
00:28:30,220 --> 00:28:32,529
Could you have made the hole a little bigger?

343
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:35,378
Why can't you guys
shoot yourselves in the heart?

344
00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:38,059
Maybe I was trying to make a statement.

345
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:40,898
Besides, it's really not my problem.

346
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:43,056
Oh, yeah. Nothing's your problem.

347
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:46,137
- Blow me, dead man.
- He had a wife and kids, asshole.

348
00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:49,297
- Lucky him. I didn't have shit.
- Whose fault is that?

349
00:28:49,340 --> 00:28:51,331
You couldn't show up to work on time.

350
00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:53,689
Maybe if you hadn't been such a prick.

351
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:56,459
It's because of people like you
that I had to do this.

352
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:59,014
What are you saying? This is my fault?

353
00:28:59,060 --> 00:29:03,497
I'm just saying a guy can only take so much
before he snaps.

354
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:09,410
Hey. We all have to deal
with a lot of shit, all right?

355
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:12,452
But when I snap I throw something
or punch a wall.

356
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:16,778
I don't pick up a shotgun
and start killing people.

357
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:19,288
Yeah. So far.

358
00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:27,738
God, it feels so good to sit here
and do absolutely nothing.

359
00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:30,772
We relax all the time. We have to.

360
00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:42,170
How do you like your new job, Keith?

361
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:45,417
Well, it pretty much sucks.

362
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:50,932
It's temporary. We're both going through
a lot of changes right now.

363
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:54,416
- All good, though.
- How's the therapy going?

364
00:29:57,220 --> 00:30:00,496
Good. We're not fighting so much.

365
00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:05,694
We never really fought that much
but we're getting along much better.

366
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:09,289
- Nate and I never fight.
- Never?

367
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:12,935
- No.
- You two have never had a fight?

368
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:19,220
- Not really.
- I don't know how you do it.

369
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:24,695
We've known each other for so long,
I guess we just understand each other.

370
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:32,975
Even so, I would think having a baby
adds so much stress.

371
00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:36,137
No, having a baby
helps put everything in perspective.

372
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:39,772
- You'll see when you have kids.
- If we have kids.

373
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:44,218
Knock, knock. Look, a party.

374
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:48,058
Hello, I'm Carol, Lisa's boss.

375
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:50,853
- Keith.
- I'm David Fisher.

376
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:54,336
- This is my house.
- You're back early.

377
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:56,655
There's nothing to do in the mountains.

378
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:59,294
I mean, fresh air's such a big deal.

379
00:31:00,660 --> 00:31:04,096
- At least no one parks in my driveway there.
- Should we move?

380
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:07,815
Lisa, I would love some cinnamon toast
and a cup of tea.

381
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:12,695
- Could you wait just a little bit?
- You would not believe the day I've had.

382
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:16,415
- Who is my most bitter enemy in the world?
- Should we go?

383
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:21,579
- We're having a little get-together.
- Melissa Gilbert.

384
00:31:21,620 --> 00:31:26,648
And who opens the door at Mark and Pam's
house? That's right. Melissa Gilbert.

385
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:29,817
It was like staring at evil itself.

386
00:31:29,860 --> 00:31:34,456
- Carol, you're not listening to me.
- I heard you. You're having a party.

387
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:37,617
They've had you all day. I need you right now.

388
00:31:37,660 --> 00:31:42,939
Bring my toast up to my bath
and I'll tell you how I made Melissa cry.

389
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:48,611
Go ahead, we're fine.

390
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:56,850
Can you believe Lisa? Her self-perception
is so far removed from reality.

391
00:31:56,900 --> 00:32:00,859
Keith, what were you talking about in there?

392
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:03,539
- If we have kids?
- Just what I said.

393
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:05,218
If we have kids.

394
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:09,572
We decided a long time ago
that we'd have kids. When did this change?

395
00:32:09,620 --> 00:32:14,569
Who are you kidding? We're in therapy
to see if we can exist as a couple.

396
00:32:14,620 --> 00:32:18,090
- Everything about us is if.
- That shouldn't change our goals.

397
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:21,532
I'm just being realistic.

398
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:26,017
I don't wanna put myself in a situation
where I end up turning into my father.

399
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:33,488
I guess I'm a little more optimistic
about our future than you are.

400
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:37,649
Get real. You and I are living day to day
and you know it.

401
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:49,700
God, I'm freezing.

402
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:52,208
God, this sucks. I'm dying.

403
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:55,332
- It'll pass.
- Give me a Klonopin.

404
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:59,214
You wanted to do this natural.
I already gave you the valerian root.

405
00:32:59,260 --> 00:33:03,731
- They're not doing shit to me.
- She's impossible.

406
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:10,699
- Now get me an Ambien.
- Sarah, really.

407
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:14,335
- It'll put her to sleep.
- Anything to shut her up.

408
00:33:18,060 --> 00:33:20,699
- I'm burning up.
- A moment ago you were freezing.

409
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:22,810
Now I'm burning up.

410
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:26,456
- Now what?
- Diarrhoea.

411
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:30,493
This is what playing with drugs will get you.
It's not pretty, is it?

412
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:48,613
- Is Carol all tucked in?
- After eight slices of toast and a Popsicle.

413
00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:55,733
- It was nice seeing David and Keith tonight.
- Yeah.

414
00:33:56,700 --> 00:34:00,693
- I feel so sorry for them.
- How come?

415
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:04,813
They've been together such a short time
and already they need counselling.

416
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:08,614
- They're just...
- Why do they stay together?

417
00:34:08,660 --> 00:34:11,618
- It's not like they have a kid.
- I don't know.

418
00:34:12,620 --> 00:34:15,453
Maybe they love each other.

419
00:34:18,180 --> 00:34:20,091
What?

420
00:34:20,140 --> 00:34:23,928
- What detergent did you use?
- I don't know. Whatever was there.

421
00:34:25,740 --> 00:34:29,096
- It smells like Tide.
- So I guess I used the Tide.

422
00:34:29,740 --> 00:34:33,016
You have to use the Dreft.
Maya gets a rash from anything else.

423
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:36,848
- But these aren't Maya's clothes.
- But I hold Maya all day long.

424
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:40,688
Why do we have Tide? Sorry
I wasn't following you around taking notes.

425
00:34:40,740 --> 00:34:43,208
Don't get mad.
I thought you knew to use Dreft.

426
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:46,297
Obviously I didn't. Now I do. Are we OK here?

427
00:34:46,340 --> 00:34:49,855
Yeah, we're OK. I just have to wash it again.

428
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:52,255
No, you don't. Here.

429
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:55,337
Put those down. Here. I'll do it.

430
00:34:56,380 --> 00:34:58,177
Thank you.

431
00:35:14,260 --> 00:35:16,057
Good afternoon.

432
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:17,897
- Is he...
- He's right in there.

433
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:25,129
Mr and Mrs Showalter,
I will be here the entire time.

434
00:35:25,180 --> 00:35:29,332
Please let me know
if there's anything at all I can do for you.

435
00:35:45,820 --> 00:35:47,776
Is that another son?

436
00:35:48,820 --> 00:35:53,848
- I hope you frisked him.
- Please try to show a little sensitivity.

437
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:59,850
Hey, I did my job. I cleaned him up all nice.

438
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:06,020
Sure, I was tempted to maybe leave
a hand or a foot unembalmed,

439
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:08,858
so he could stink like he should, but no.

440
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:14,331
- I'm a professional.
- Then act like one.

441
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:16,450
These people loved this man.

442
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:25,533
They didn't know him as a murderer,
they knew him as their son, their brother.

443
00:36:26,660 --> 00:36:30,573
These people were responsible for him.
They should have known...

444
00:36:30,620 --> 00:36:35,614
Jesus Christ, Federico. I'm getting sick
of all this moral superiority.

445
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:40,575
- Everything is so black and white for you.
- You know what? I just...

446
00:36:42,860 --> 00:36:48,730
You can't ever really know a person. If you
think you can, you're living in a dream world.

447
00:36:56,340 --> 00:36:58,774
I made egg salad.

448
00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:03,489
Jolts of electricity are shooting
through my body.

449
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:05,337
They're tearing me apart.

450
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:07,891
Then Bettina and I will eat.

451
00:37:15,340 --> 00:37:17,331
Maybe I'll have a little.

452
00:37:27,740 --> 00:37:30,777
So how long have you
been taking the Vicodin?

453
00:37:32,860 --> 00:37:35,135
I don't know.

454
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:39,057
On and off for years.

455
00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:41,334
Why?

456
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:54,128
Because somewhere along the line
I started to realise...

457
00:37:55,780 --> 00:37:59,295
I was no longer the youngest
or prettiest girl in the room.

458
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:06,851
For a while I satisfied myself

459
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:11,091
with being the most intriguing.

460
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:15,892
But eventually
I just became the one in paisley.

461
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:19,614
It's too fucking depressing.

462
00:38:19,660 --> 00:38:22,220
Sorry, but you know
you're much more than that.

463
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:24,251
Yeah. You're a drug addict.

464
00:38:26,140 --> 00:38:29,530
- I need to spice this up a little.
- Tell me what you want.

465
00:38:29,580 --> 00:38:31,730
- No...
- Sit down.

466
00:38:31,780 --> 00:38:34,738
- I need spices.
- Where is it?

467
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:37,055
- In the kitchen.
- Where is the Vicodin?

468
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:42,337
- I don't know what...
- We found your stash in the laundry room.

469
00:38:42,380 --> 00:38:45,816
- Where else? The spice rack?
- You're being ridiculous.

470
00:38:45,860 --> 00:38:48,818
- Let me go.
- Where's the Vicodin?

471
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:51,772
- You're hurting me.
- Where? Where?

472
00:38:51,820 --> 00:38:53,811
Where?

473
00:38:53,860 --> 00:38:57,694
In the coriander jar, you pig-fucker.

474
00:38:57,740 --> 00:38:59,617
Your lies aren't helping, dear.

475
00:39:03,220 --> 00:39:07,975
Here. Ruth and I are gonna go outside
and get some air.

476
00:39:09,620 --> 00:39:13,499
- What are you doing?
- You don't think I'm just gonna leave you?

477
00:39:13,540 --> 00:39:15,531
You can't tie me up.

478
00:39:16,340 --> 00:39:18,615
It's for your own good.

479
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:24,936
Do you want me to break this arm?
Because I will.

480
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:33,775
Yeah. That should hold.

481
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:41,975
I hope the coyotes eat you!

482
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:45,171
So do I!

483
00:39:57,340 --> 00:39:59,649
I don't know how you remain so calm.

484
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:02,655
I took a Vicodin.

485
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:04,816
- Not really?
- Yeah.

486
00:40:05,380 --> 00:40:07,769
I figured if there was ever a time...

487
00:40:08,820 --> 00:40:11,493
- You want one?
- No, thank you.

488
00:40:11,540 --> 00:40:15,055
I'll kill you both, I swear I will!

489
00:40:16,660 --> 00:40:19,299
Well, maybe half.

490
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:27,491
Help!

491
00:40:35,380 --> 00:40:38,019
- I think there's some meatloaf in here.
- OK.

492
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:44,291
- Hey.
- Hi.

493
00:40:46,060 --> 00:40:48,528
You're Phil, right, the crematory guy?

494
00:40:48,580 --> 00:40:50,571
Yeah. Hey, Nate.

495
00:40:52,220 --> 00:40:54,575
- What?
- Nothing.

496
00:40:59,060 --> 00:41:02,450
Mom called. She's spending another night
at Aunt Sarah's.

497
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:04,297
Cool.

498
00:41:04,340 --> 00:41:07,889
- We're gonna stay here, then.
- Sure.

499
00:41:07,940 --> 00:41:12,138
Also there's a couple of death certificates
you could pick up tomorrow.

500
00:41:12,180 --> 00:41:13,454
Where?

501
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:19,132
One's in a nursing home and the other,
I think, is also in a nursing home.

502
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:23,534
I hate those places.
So many old people that wanna touch my hair.

503
00:41:34,220 --> 00:41:38,418
- Sometimes animals are that way.
- He gets on better with people.

504
00:41:38,460 --> 00:41:42,294
OK. And he likes people. And they like him.

505
00:41:42,340 --> 00:41:45,616
So he said, "Don't worry, Mum,
I'm gonna be just fine. "

506
00:41:48,140 --> 00:41:50,131
Hey, Lise.

507
00:41:51,180 --> 00:41:54,377
No, I'll probably just grab a sandwich here.

508
00:41:55,540 --> 00:41:59,419
I'll probably leave in about an hour.
I've still got a bunch of shit to do.

509
00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:03,055
I love you too. Give Maya a kiss from me. Bye.

510
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:09,535
We're considering getting him a girlfriend.

511
00:42:09,580 --> 00:42:12,811
He's had a number of girlfriends.

512
00:42:12,860 --> 00:42:16,011
- Nate's the one who just got married?
- Yeah.

513
00:42:17,020 --> 00:42:19,090
You like his wife?

514
00:42:19,940 --> 00:42:22,852
I don't really know her that well, but I like her.

515
00:42:24,140 --> 00:42:26,256
You should have met his last girlfriend.

516
00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:30,339
She was Charlotte Light And Dark.

517
00:42:30,380 --> 00:42:33,099
Not for real? The barking girl?

518
00:42:33,140 --> 00:42:36,257
- For real.
- Wow.

519
00:42:39,340 --> 00:42:41,808
- You want another?
- No. I'm good.

520
00:42:43,380 --> 00:42:46,770
So, we should do something.

521
00:42:46,820 --> 00:42:49,175
Like next Friday or Saturday.

522
00:42:54,340 --> 00:42:56,331
Do you have a really busy week?

523
00:42:58,740 --> 00:43:00,651
I don't know.

524
00:43:00,700 --> 00:43:03,498
Because when you say
next Friday or Saturday,

525
00:43:03,540 --> 00:43:08,295
that kind of sounds
like not until next Friday or Saturday.

526
00:43:12,100 --> 00:43:17,572
Have you been thinking the two of us are...
well, you know, exclusive?

527
00:43:19,020 --> 00:43:22,376
Cos I never really meant
to give that impression.

528
00:43:24,860 --> 00:43:27,454
- What do you mean?
- Well...

529
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:29,809
That sometimes I see other women.

530
00:43:34,060 --> 00:43:37,291
And by "see" you mean fuck?

531
00:43:38,220 --> 00:43:40,415
However you wanna put it.

532
00:43:44,380 --> 00:43:46,177
Yeah, I mean I figured.

533
00:43:48,620 --> 00:43:53,330
Until you really get to know someone,
it seems the way to go.

534
00:43:54,540 --> 00:43:56,531
Yeah, of course.

535
00:43:57,420 --> 00:44:01,698
You see other guys, don't you?
You're always talking about Russell.

536
00:44:01,740 --> 00:44:03,332
Russell's gay.

537
00:44:06,420 --> 00:44:10,572
But I guess if I was to meet someone...

538
00:44:10,620 --> 00:44:13,498
Not that I'm looking to fuck around, but...

539
00:44:14,540 --> 00:44:16,974
I guess if I liked someone, whatever.

540
00:44:17,620 --> 00:44:19,133
Cool.

541
00:44:35,500 --> 00:44:36,979
Are you mad?

542
00:44:44,460 --> 00:44:46,257
Do you want me to go?

543
00:44:48,940 --> 00:44:50,498
No.

544
00:45:04,660 --> 00:45:07,174
Do you wanna go up to your room?

545
00:45:08,860 --> 00:45:11,135
Yeah. Let's go.

546
00:45:21,140 --> 00:45:24,655
Back in Texas,
we call ice cream frozen cow juice.

547
00:45:24,700 --> 00:45:27,055
Excuse me for a second.

548
00:45:28,580 --> 00:45:31,253
- Thank you.
- No, no. Thank you.

549
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:38,731
Baby, I'm warning you. I'm in a bad mood.
I had a very bad day.

550
00:45:38,780 --> 00:45:42,978
I found out one of my favourite doctors
was arrested for selling steroids.

551
00:45:43,020 --> 00:45:46,774
Now there's a rumour
that AmeriMed's gonna close the hospital.

552
00:45:46,820 --> 00:45:50,699
- That's great.
- There's KFC in the microwave.

553
00:45:50,740 --> 00:45:54,050
Sorry, I just had to get you out
from under my feet for a while.

554
00:45:54,100 --> 00:45:57,012
...but I brought my karate gear.

555
00:45:58,260 --> 00:46:01,058
Julio, could you please
turn that damn thing down?

556
00:46:06,980 --> 00:46:11,337
Andy won't beat me this time
because I've got the elements on my side.

557
00:46:11,380 --> 00:46:14,452
Elements of surprise.

558
00:46:14,500 --> 00:46:17,572
- Andy.
- I'm sandy, all right.

559
00:46:18,820 --> 00:46:21,732
I'm very sandy.

560
00:46:28,300 --> 00:46:30,768
I may be down but I'm not out.

561
00:46:31,780 --> 00:46:35,409
Way to go. It took us three days
to make that potato salad.

562
00:46:36,980 --> 00:46:39,130
There we go.

563
00:46:42,740 --> 00:46:45,812
- Are you going to the store tomorrow?
- I wasn't planning to.

564
00:46:46,300 --> 00:46:49,098
- What do you need?
- Baby wipes.

565
00:46:49,140 --> 00:46:52,337
And baby food, but you have to go
to Whole Foods for that.

566
00:46:52,380 --> 00:46:56,055
But at Rite Aid you can get her
a new sippy cup and nail clippers.

567
00:46:56,100 --> 00:46:59,888
You get them in the baby section.
The others are too big.

568
00:46:59,940 --> 00:47:03,615
Toilet paper,
light bulbs, the energy-efficient ones,

569
00:47:03,660 --> 00:47:07,335
and facial scrub for me,
you know, the peach kind.

570
00:47:08,380 --> 00:47:12,931
- You're gonna have to write everything down.
- It's on the refrigerator.

571
00:47:13,820 --> 00:47:17,972
All right.
I'll try to do it on my way home from work.

572
00:47:19,780 --> 00:47:22,135
You're going to try or you'll do it?

573
00:47:23,380 --> 00:47:26,895
- Because if you can't, then I'll do it.
- I'll do it.

574
00:47:27,900 --> 00:47:30,255
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

575
00:47:34,620 --> 00:47:37,214
I had to make carrot soup
for Carol's stylist today

576
00:47:37,260 --> 00:47:40,138
and drive it out to her in Culver City.

577
00:47:40,180 --> 00:47:43,456
She's been sent to earth
with the sole purpose of torturing you.

578
00:47:43,500 --> 00:47:46,697
- It's true.
- I don't work for her and she drives me crazy.

579
00:47:47,980 --> 00:47:50,096
She wants me to make her rice pudding.

580
00:47:50,140 --> 00:47:52,734
I'll use whole milk. Gives her diarrhoea.

581
00:47:57,020 --> 00:48:00,933
We could call all our friends
and have them park in her driveway.

582
00:48:00,980 --> 00:48:04,814
We could take pictures of her swimming naked
and post them on the internet.

583
00:48:04,860 --> 00:48:09,012
God, I saw her once. She has the biggest bush
I have ever seen in my life.

584
00:48:09,060 --> 00:48:11,016
She really does.

585
00:48:22,060 --> 00:48:25,370
If I told you something,
would you promise not to laugh?

586
00:48:25,420 --> 00:48:26,739
No.

587
00:48:29,460 --> 00:48:34,773
This is the first time I have ever been
in a hammock. They always scared me.

588
00:48:39,100 --> 00:48:41,136
I always saw them in cartoons.

589
00:48:41,180 --> 00:48:44,729
People would get in them
and they'd spin around so fast

590
00:48:44,780 --> 00:48:47,499
and the people would go flying.

591
00:48:47,540 --> 00:48:50,100
Don't worry, you're safe.

592
00:49:07,540 --> 00:49:10,008
It's so peaceful out here.

593
00:49:19,980 --> 00:49:23,575
- I'm dying!
- Want some more wine?

594
00:49:23,620 --> 00:49:25,611
Sure. Why not?

595
00:49:25,660 --> 00:49:29,699
- I'm dying!
- Take a slug right out of the bottle.

596
00:49:29,740 --> 00:49:32,618
- Really?
- Go on.

597
00:49:34,460 --> 00:49:36,974
I feel like an old hobo.

598
00:49:38,380 --> 00:49:41,133
Maybe we should hop a freight train.

599
00:49:41,180 --> 00:49:44,138
We could head up to Frisco.

600
00:49:45,100 --> 00:49:47,295
Pick us up a couple of sailors.

601
00:49:49,300 --> 00:49:51,973
We're so bad.

602
00:49:52,020 --> 00:49:55,057
Yes, we are.
