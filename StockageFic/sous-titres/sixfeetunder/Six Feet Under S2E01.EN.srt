1
00:02:39,493 --> 00:02:42,007
Tad? Is that you?

2
00:02:44,013 --> 00:02:45,492
You're early.

3
00:02:50,653 --> 00:02:54,407
Time to kiss
your sweet ass goodbye, cupcake.

4
00:03:14,613 --> 00:03:17,332
Seriously, several people told me
that my scene...

5
00:03:17,413 --> 00:03:20,883
is really the only one
that's even remotely scary.

6
00:03:21,213 --> 00:03:24,125
Becky, you make a major impact
in this movie.

7
00:03:25,653 --> 00:03:29,771
Somebody even said that Angelica's scene,
it wasn't even scary at all.

8
00:03:29,853 --> 00:03:33,562
Like, it was funny, and not in a good way.

9
00:03:34,453 --> 00:03:36,887
We have to make sure
you don't get pigeon-holed now...

10
00:03:36,973 --> 00:03:40,283
which is why I think
you shouldn't show your tits anymore.

11
00:03:43,733 --> 00:03:45,132
What a piece of shit!

12
00:03:45,213 --> 00:03:48,922
I know, it makes fucking Blair Witch 2
look like Titanic.

13
00:03:49,373 --> 00:03:51,728
It's just so fucking gratuitous!

14
00:03:52,573 --> 00:03:55,167
I think that
what makes this movie different...

15
00:03:55,253 --> 00:03:58,051
is that the violence isn't so gratuitous.

16
00:03:58,413 --> 00:04:01,166
It's more like the whole movie is about...

17
00:04:01,253 --> 00:04:04,529
the whole psychological nature of fear.

18
00:04:05,853 --> 00:04:08,492
I totally maxed out his Visa card
paying for it.

19
00:04:08,573 --> 00:04:12,043
Then somebody in Joe Roth's office saw it
and said it was genius.

20
00:04:12,133 --> 00:04:14,328
And now we have three meetings.

21
00:04:14,533 --> 00:04:19,084
Seriously, you could write it.
I've read your poetry and it's really good.

22
00:04:19,333 --> 00:04:20,891
I think I should direct it, too.

23
00:04:20,973 --> 00:04:25,489
Yeah, and we should have
this really hot sex scene, all gritty and real.

24
00:04:26,013 --> 00:04:27,924
You know, like, European.

25
00:04:28,453 --> 00:04:32,571
I'm not showing my ass. My manager says
I need to stop showing my ass.

26
00:04:54,813 --> 00:04:57,407
You have a piece of toilet paper
stuck to your shoe.

27
00:04:57,493 --> 00:04:59,006
Shut up! Where?

28
00:05:27,773 --> 00:05:30,207
-Honey, it's not working.
-What?

29
00:05:30,293 --> 00:05:33,649
No, no. It's not gonna happen for me.

30
00:05:46,533 --> 00:05:49,445
It's not. It's not gonna happen for me.

31
00:05:50,493 --> 00:05:51,721
I'm sorry.

32
00:05:54,133 --> 00:05:57,330
-What's wrong?
-Nothing. Don't take it personally.

33
00:05:58,093 --> 00:05:59,970
Don't make this about me.

34
00:06:00,053 --> 00:06:02,328
What? Am I not allowed
to not have sex for once?

35
00:06:02,413 --> 00:06:04,847
Is that what our relationship is now?

36
00:06:06,333 --> 00:06:09,530
Wait a minute. You woke me up
by going down on me.

37
00:06:16,373 --> 00:06:18,841
I don't know what's wrong with me.

38
00:06:21,293 --> 00:06:22,806
Maybe that car accident we had...

39
00:06:22,893 --> 00:06:26,602
gave me some weird,
Oliver-Sacks-blow-to-the-head disease.

40
00:06:31,733 --> 00:06:34,372
Sorry. My whole life seems like a bad dream.

41
00:06:39,573 --> 00:06:41,848
It's like somebody else's life.

42
00:06:43,293 --> 00:06:47,252
Like, if my life were a movie,
I'd fall asleep or I'd walk out.

43
00:06:51,933 --> 00:06:54,572
-You still not seeing any clients?
-I can't.

44
00:06:56,333 --> 00:06:57,925
I can't face it.

45
00:07:01,013 --> 00:07:02,162
You know...

46
00:07:03,813 --> 00:07:07,249
sometimes you just got to force yourself
to be active.

47
00:07:08,053 --> 00:07:10,442
-When you're, you know....
-Like what?

48
00:07:10,893 --> 00:07:12,531
When you're what?

49
00:07:14,333 --> 00:07:16,289
You think I'm depressed?

50
00:07:18,933 --> 00:07:21,128
-Are you?
-Yeah.

51
00:07:24,853 --> 00:07:27,367
Doesn't mean I wanna talk about it.

52
00:07:28,373 --> 00:07:29,488
Okay.

53
00:07:35,173 --> 00:07:37,562
This is my sister-in-law, Angie.

54
00:07:38,653 --> 00:07:41,008
-Angelica.
-It's nice to meet you.

55
00:07:41,133 --> 00:07:44,045
Likewise. And this is Brody Farrell.

56
00:07:46,093 --> 00:07:48,482
-Are you the next of kin?
-No.

57
00:07:49,133 --> 00:07:51,806
Becky's parents died when she was two.

58
00:07:52,533 --> 00:07:56,446
She was raised by her grandmother,
who also died.

59
00:07:57,573 --> 00:08:01,009
She didn't really have anybody, except us.

60
00:08:01,853 --> 00:08:06,131
-I see. Can I ask who will be...
-The cast of the movie.

61
00:08:06,293 --> 00:08:08,807
We're all pitching in to pay for it.

62
00:08:12,693 --> 00:08:15,446
We're going to need one person
to be designated as the...

63
00:08:15,533 --> 00:08:17,410
-Brody will do that.
-Yeah.

64
00:08:18,013 --> 00:08:20,243
She was sort of my girlfriend.

65
00:08:23,373 --> 00:08:25,409
Do you know
what kind of service you'd like?

66
00:08:25,493 --> 00:08:26,608
Cheap.

67
00:08:28,853 --> 00:08:32,971
We provide a variety of services
for the more budget-conscious client.

68
00:08:34,333 --> 00:08:37,962
-Sorry. Just let me turn this off.
-Take it.

69
00:08:40,373 --> 00:08:41,965
I can handle it.

70
00:08:43,653 --> 00:08:45,325
Please excuse me.

71
00:08:48,653 --> 00:08:50,928
-David Fisher.
-Hi, David. It's Kevin Miller.

72
00:08:51,013 --> 00:08:54,528
You answered my personal ad
in the LA Weekly. I'm the fireman.

73
00:08:55,413 --> 00:08:57,324
Yes, hi. Of course.

74
00:08:57,853 --> 00:09:01,562
We can start with
the most simple of traditional funerals...

75
00:09:01,813 --> 00:09:04,566
which would include
our American Eagle casket here.

76
00:09:04,653 --> 00:09:06,769
I don't think we should bury her.

77
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:10,444
Becky was totally terrified of the dark.

78
00:09:14,533 --> 00:09:16,649
We can still have a viewing...

79
00:09:18,413 --> 00:09:22,611
during which the casket will never
be closed, followed by a cremation.

80
00:09:23,693 --> 00:09:28,084
That's good. And then we could scatter
her ashes some place she really liked.

81
00:09:28,733 --> 00:09:32,248
Like Griffith Park,
or the Lava Lounge on La Brea.

82
00:09:34,013 --> 00:09:36,607
I mean, I think we can skip the casket.

83
00:09:40,253 --> 00:09:42,369
You sound like a really nice guy, too.

84
00:09:42,453 --> 00:09:46,492
I am a really nice guy. So, do you want
to meet for coffee later this afternoon?

85
00:09:46,573 --> 00:09:50,725
This afternoon? Sure. I have something
at 3:00, but I can meet you after that.

86
00:09:50,813 --> 00:09:54,123
Great, let's say at 4:00,
at the Up All Night Coffee House.

87
00:09:54,213 --> 00:09:56,044
I'll be wearing a red baseball cap.

88
00:09:56,133 --> 00:09:59,045
Great, I love red.
It's one of my favorite colors...

89
00:09:59,213 --> 00:10:02,444
-of which I have several.
-Okay, see you then.

90
00:10:05,413 --> 00:10:09,247
This is a beautiful
and unusual cremains vessel.

91
00:10:09,413 --> 00:10:13,088
The ashes actually fill these dolphins,
which are carved out inside.

92
00:10:13,173 --> 00:10:14,845
She wasn't really into dolphins.

93
00:10:15,253 --> 00:10:19,041
I remember somebody suggesting
she boycott tuna...

94
00:10:19,773 --> 00:10:23,083
because of the whole
dolphins-getting-caught-in-the-net thing.

95
00:10:23,173 --> 00:10:24,606
And she said:

96
00:10:25,133 --> 00:10:28,728
"Fuck dolphins. I want a Nicoise salad. "

97
00:10:32,493 --> 00:10:36,202
-What are these?
-Those are keepsake miniature urns.

98
00:10:37,013 --> 00:10:39,129
Sort of like lockets, if you will.

99
00:10:39,413 --> 00:10:41,722
So everybody can get a piece of her.

100
00:10:42,213 --> 00:10:45,205
Yes, it's an old custom from Thailand.

101
00:10:46,933 --> 00:10:50,084
-Becky loved Thai food.
-So what did I miss?

102
00:11:06,013 --> 00:11:07,844
I'm sorry I'm late.

103
00:11:09,453 --> 00:11:11,205
Why weren't you at school today?

104
00:11:11,293 --> 00:11:14,968
I was in school today.
I just wasn't in American History.

105
00:11:15,653 --> 00:11:18,963
I mean, who needs to know
that shit anyways, right?

106
00:11:20,253 --> 00:11:23,086
Somebody who wants to have a concept
of how the world works...

107
00:11:23,173 --> 00:11:25,767
so they can have a fucking chance in life.

108
00:11:26,453 --> 00:11:28,808
What crawled up your ass?

109
00:11:29,933 --> 00:11:31,924
It's all lies anyways.

110
00:11:33,333 --> 00:11:34,812
Where were you?

111
00:11:35,853 --> 00:11:38,970
Andy and I skipped out after lunch.
We went to the car museum.

112
00:11:39,053 --> 00:11:40,372
Did you get high?

113
00:11:42,773 --> 00:11:47,005
I'm 18 years old, living in fucking California.
I'm not allowed to get high?

114
00:11:47,093 --> 00:11:48,890
I'm worried about you, Gabe.

115
00:11:48,973 --> 00:11:52,329
In case you don't remember,
I have good reason to be.

116
00:12:01,253 --> 00:12:02,925
I'm sorry, okay?

117
00:12:05,133 --> 00:12:07,886
But you don't have to worry about me,
I swear.

118
00:12:11,973 --> 00:12:14,089
Just please don't lie to me.

119
00:12:15,133 --> 00:12:16,407
I'm not.

120
00:12:19,373 --> 00:12:20,772
I'm okay...

121
00:12:21,733 --> 00:12:23,849
and I'm gonna stay okay...

122
00:12:26,893 --> 00:12:28,770
as long as I have you.

123
00:12:49,213 --> 00:12:51,568
Let's take a look at your test results.

124
00:12:53,253 --> 00:12:58,043
Well, I have some very good news.
You tested negative for the HIV antibody.

125
00:12:58,133 --> 00:12:59,486
Thank God.

126
00:12:59,773 --> 00:13:03,083
You need to be tested again in six months,
just to be safe.

127
00:13:03,253 --> 00:13:07,405
Let's see, negative for chlamydia,
all hepatitises, syphilis.

128
00:13:08,613 --> 00:13:10,524
Positive for gonorrhea.

129
00:13:10,733 --> 00:13:12,325
-What?
-Yeah.

130
00:13:13,133 --> 00:13:15,522
Have you had any pain
or difficulty urinating?

131
00:13:15,613 --> 00:13:18,002
-No.
-Any penile or anal discharge?

132
00:13:18,733 --> 00:13:19,961
No.

133
00:13:20,613 --> 00:13:23,002
Gonorrhea can be
completely asymptomatic...

134
00:13:23,093 --> 00:13:26,722
but if it's left untreated, it can
lead to severe problems down the line.

135
00:13:26,813 --> 00:13:30,328
I'm gonna give you some Cipro.
It usually knocks it right out.

136
00:13:30,773 --> 00:13:32,843
Well, this is certainly embarrassing.

137
00:13:32,933 --> 00:13:35,049
Did you engage in unprotected sex?

138
00:13:36,413 --> 00:13:37,562
Yes.

139
00:13:38,493 --> 00:13:39,846
Bad boy.

140
00:13:55,013 --> 00:13:57,766
-How was school?
-Dull and depressing.

141
00:14:02,293 --> 00:14:03,806
What are you reading?

142
00:14:04,093 --> 00:14:05,685
Now That You Know.

143
00:14:06,253 --> 00:14:08,084
Now that you know what?

144
00:14:09,133 --> 00:14:10,646
That David is gay.

145
00:14:14,013 --> 00:14:16,049
I take it you knew already.

146
00:14:20,853 --> 00:14:22,605
How do you feel about it?

147
00:14:22,693 --> 00:14:24,763
Are you hurt? Angry?

148
00:14:25,893 --> 00:14:28,771
-Do you wish he wasn't gay?
-No.

149
00:14:29,613 --> 00:14:32,332
Those are all valid feelings, you know.

150
00:14:33,653 --> 00:14:36,611
I don't care if he's gay,
just as long as he's happy.

151
00:14:37,453 --> 00:14:39,250
According to this book...

152
00:14:39,613 --> 00:14:42,207
we should all be very open to how we feel...

153
00:14:42,453 --> 00:14:44,887
and we should
try to express those feelings...

154
00:14:44,973 --> 00:14:47,726
because the foundation of intimacy is truth.

155
00:14:48,933 --> 00:14:49,922
Okay.

156
00:14:51,133 --> 00:14:54,330
Have you ever had any feelings
of same-sex attraction?

157
00:14:54,733 --> 00:14:56,849
What? No, Mom.

158
00:14:57,373 --> 00:14:59,967
-It's nothing to be ashamed of.
-I know.

159
00:15:03,853 --> 00:15:05,684
When I was your age...

160
00:15:07,013 --> 00:15:09,607
I actually had a little crush on Jane Fonda.

161
00:15:13,933 --> 00:15:16,401
She's single again, so now's your chance.

162
00:15:23,853 --> 00:15:27,323
I just never got into
that whole promiscuous thing, you know.

163
00:15:28,013 --> 00:15:29,810
First guy I had sex with...

164
00:15:29,893 --> 00:15:32,805
I ended up in a relationship with
for four years.

165
00:15:33,973 --> 00:15:37,170
One-man kind of guy. Always have been.
What about you?

166
00:15:37,933 --> 00:15:39,252
Definitely.

167
00:15:40,533 --> 00:15:43,366
Sex just for the sake of having sex,
what is that?

168
00:15:43,453 --> 00:15:47,287
Don't get me wrong. I love sex.
I'm a very sexual being.

169
00:15:48,013 --> 00:15:52,450
I just think it's better when there's
something emotional going on behind it.

170
00:15:54,493 --> 00:15:56,085
I credit my parents for that.

171
00:15:56,173 --> 00:15:58,892
My mom and dad have been together
for almost 40 years.

172
00:15:58,973 --> 00:16:00,770
They're still hot for each other.

173
00:16:00,853 --> 00:16:04,129
And they've never been anything
but 100%% supportive of me.

174
00:16:04,973 --> 00:16:06,042
Wow.

175
00:16:19,693 --> 00:16:23,242
I gotta get to work.
Listen, it's been great meeting you.

176
00:16:24,093 --> 00:16:27,051
This was fun. Would you like to do it again?

177
00:16:27,253 --> 00:16:28,891
I don't think so.

178
00:16:29,693 --> 00:16:32,526
You seem like a really nice guy,
but I gotta be honest.

179
00:16:32,613 --> 00:16:34,729
I didn't feel much of a spark.

180
00:16:35,733 --> 00:16:38,725
Can't make it happen if it's not there, right?

181
00:16:52,893 --> 00:16:55,088
It definitely looks like AVM.

182
00:16:57,293 --> 00:16:58,362
Fuck.

183
00:17:02,533 --> 00:17:03,761
So now what?

184
00:17:04,493 --> 00:17:07,849
Well, that depends.
Remind me what your symptoms have been.

185
00:17:08,133 --> 00:17:10,124
-Headaches.
-All the time?

186
00:17:11,053 --> 00:17:14,363
No, just occasionally.
Mostly on the left side of my head.

187
00:17:15,573 --> 00:17:19,566
Any seizures? Impairment of vision?
Sense of smell?

188
00:17:20,373 --> 00:17:24,048
Once I had a flutter,
just on the edge of my vision.

189
00:17:24,573 --> 00:17:25,926
I'm as blind as a bat.

190
00:17:26,013 --> 00:17:29,244
Once I woke up,
I could see perfectly out of my left eye.

191
00:17:29,333 --> 00:17:33,485
Lasted for a day and then it went away.
Who knows what the hell that was?

192
00:17:37,933 --> 00:17:39,446
So what next?

193
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:42,485
Well, let's see.

194
00:17:45,613 --> 00:17:48,650
It's in a not overly-eloquent brain area.

195
00:17:50,733 --> 00:17:52,530
-You left-handed?
-No.

196
00:17:53,413 --> 00:17:55,210
-That's not good.
-Why not?

197
00:17:55,293 --> 00:17:57,966
And it's a little larger than I'd like it to be.

198
00:17:58,053 --> 00:18:01,011
Yeah, it's a little larger than I'd like it to be.

199
00:18:01,853 --> 00:18:02,888
Okay.

200
00:18:03,773 --> 00:18:06,606
You want options, I'll give you the big three:

201
00:18:07,293 --> 00:18:09,887
Cranial surgery. Not a picnic.

202
00:18:10,253 --> 00:18:11,732
Embolization.

203
00:18:13,333 --> 00:18:16,131
Closing off the blood vessels
by injecting glue into them.

204
00:18:16,213 --> 00:18:19,205
Sometimes we use platinum coils instead.

205
00:18:21,253 --> 00:18:23,369
And finally, radial surgery.

206
00:18:24,853 --> 00:18:26,525
Focused radiation.

207
00:18:28,453 --> 00:18:30,444
Die, you little motherfucker!

208
00:18:38,693 --> 00:18:42,971
If I'd never been in a car accident
and gotten a routine x-ray of my skull...

209
00:18:43,693 --> 00:18:45,684
this would've never even come up, right?

210
00:18:45,773 --> 00:18:47,525
Until something happened.

211
00:18:47,613 --> 00:18:52,050
It's possible that I could go my entire life
without it ever creating a problem.

212
00:18:52,773 --> 00:18:56,004
-Anything's possible.
-Do you think I need surgery?

213
00:18:56,173 --> 00:18:58,607
I can't really say, without more tests.

214
00:18:58,693 --> 00:19:01,253
I think you might benefit from embolization.

215
00:19:01,413 --> 00:19:05,645
However, any time you close off
the large arteries going into an AVM...

216
00:19:05,853 --> 00:19:10,643
the smaller blood vessels feeding it
tend to increase in size.

217
00:19:12,133 --> 00:19:14,488
Okay, so it doesn't really work.

218
00:19:17,813 --> 00:19:20,168
-There's only so much we can do.
-Oh, God!

219
00:19:20,293 --> 00:19:23,410
Fuck! Fine. You know what?
Just don't do anything, okay?

220
00:19:23,493 --> 00:19:28,169
I'm going to put this all out of my head,
no pun intended, and just get on with life.

221
00:19:28,253 --> 00:19:29,368
I'm not sure...

222
00:19:29,453 --> 00:19:33,207
I don't give a fuck what you think,
you arrogant piece of shit.

223
00:19:34,333 --> 00:19:37,291
Okay, even if we decide not to do anything
at this juncture...

224
00:19:37,373 --> 00:19:39,170
There's no "we. " I decide.

225
00:19:39,253 --> 00:19:41,892
I'd still like to get another MRl on you
in 12 months.

226
00:19:41,973 --> 00:19:44,771
And I'd like
a fucking straight answer, asshole.

227
00:19:46,493 --> 00:19:47,892
It's kind of ironic.

228
00:19:48,093 --> 00:19:51,802
You don't smoke, you run every day,
eat all that healthy crap.

229
00:19:51,933 --> 00:19:53,161
Shut up!

230
00:19:54,213 --> 00:19:57,523
Now me, I smoked, I drank,
I ate any old thing I wanted.

231
00:19:58,373 --> 00:20:02,366
And I inhaled embalming fluid
for God knows how long. You know what?

232
00:20:02,453 --> 00:20:05,604
If it wasn't for that bus,
I'd have lived to be 93.

233
00:20:07,373 --> 00:20:11,730
It's the first time I've driven since then.
You may want to fasten your seatbelt.

234
00:20:12,733 --> 00:20:15,691
Well, who's the dead man in this car?
It's not me!

235
00:20:19,093 --> 00:20:20,367
Fuck you!

236
00:21:30,693 --> 00:21:32,126
We thank you, Heavenly Father...

237
00:21:32,213 --> 00:21:34,966
for this and all Thy blessings
in Christ's name. Amen.

238
00:21:35,053 --> 00:21:36,168
Amen.

239
00:21:38,933 --> 00:21:42,972
I've invited Nikolai to dinner Sunday night.
I'd like you all to be there.

240
00:21:43,573 --> 00:21:45,484
Nikolai the flower guy?

241
00:21:45,813 --> 00:21:49,203
Yes, he and I are having
a sexual relationship now.

242
00:21:49,413 --> 00:21:53,326
I'm not sure if it's something
that's going to last, but there it is.

243
00:21:55,853 --> 00:22:00,131
We're all adults. We're all sexual beings.
We should acknowledge that.

244
00:22:05,053 --> 00:22:06,168
Okay.

245
00:22:07,693 --> 00:22:12,289
Nate, I'd like you to invite Brenda.
Claire, I'd like you to invite Gabriel Dimas.

246
00:22:12,933 --> 00:22:17,370
And, David, if you have a special friend,
I'd like for him to come, as well.

247
00:22:18,573 --> 00:22:20,564
Why is my friend special?

248
00:22:21,133 --> 00:22:25,570
All right. If you're having sex with anyone,
I'd like to meet him. Is that better?

249
00:22:25,653 --> 00:22:27,006
Not really.

250
00:22:28,813 --> 00:22:30,849
Stop acting like children!

251
00:22:34,973 --> 00:22:37,965
-Where are you going?
-I'm just getting an aspirin.

252
00:22:38,053 --> 00:22:39,691
Do you have a headache?

253
00:22:39,773 --> 00:22:43,209
No, I read you should take an aspirin a day.
It keeps the blood thin.

254
00:22:43,293 --> 00:22:46,126
Please, if our blood were any thinner,
we'd evaporate.

255
00:22:46,213 --> 00:22:50,411
What's that supposed to mean? Is that
some sort of insult? We're thin-blooded?

256
00:22:50,493 --> 00:22:54,486
Mom, no, it was a joke. I'm more
thin-blooded than any of us, probably.

257
00:22:55,493 --> 00:22:57,404
Are you seeing anyone?

258
00:22:59,133 --> 00:23:00,168
No.

259
00:23:01,613 --> 00:23:02,841
Why not?

260
00:23:03,373 --> 00:23:07,161
Sex is an important and healthy part of life.
It's nothing to be ashamed of.

261
00:23:07,253 --> 00:23:10,882
Yes, I know that.
Unfortunately, I'm not having any right now.

262
00:23:11,533 --> 00:23:13,683
What happened to that cop...

263
00:23:14,293 --> 00:23:15,772
the black man?

264
00:23:16,933 --> 00:23:18,730
He met someone else.

265
00:23:30,013 --> 00:23:31,332
Thank you.

266
00:23:31,813 --> 00:23:34,088
You don't have any free time tomorrow?

267
00:23:34,853 --> 00:23:37,242
-I don't think so.
-I'd really like to see you.

268
00:23:37,333 --> 00:23:39,722
I have three shiatsu appointments.

269
00:23:42,893 --> 00:23:45,885
You're the one that wanted me
to get on with my life.

270
00:23:46,413 --> 00:23:49,086
You can still come Sunday night
for dinner, right?

271
00:23:49,213 --> 00:23:52,888
Even if just for the entertainment value.
It's bound to be a freak fest.

272
00:23:53,333 --> 00:23:55,893
I think so. Maybe.

273
00:23:56,973 --> 00:23:59,965
-I miss you.
-You just saw me.

274
00:24:00,373 --> 00:24:02,125
I know, I just...

275
00:24:03,173 --> 00:24:06,643
would really like to be with you
at this moment in time.

276
00:24:07,173 --> 00:24:09,607
-Right now.
-I'll see you soon.

277
00:24:10,693 --> 00:24:12,172
Sunday, okay?

278
00:24:14,213 --> 00:24:15,566
I love you.

279
00:24:16,093 --> 00:24:17,606
I love you, too.

280
00:24:41,933 --> 00:24:46,165
-Hey, Rico.
-Hey, boss man. I've got a favor to ask you.

281
00:24:48,213 --> 00:24:49,282
Okay.

282
00:24:49,373 --> 00:24:53,207
Could you please drop her off
at the crematorium for me tonight?

283
00:24:54,093 --> 00:24:56,926
Come on, man.
Vanessa's just a bit overwhelmed at home.

284
00:24:57,013 --> 00:25:01,086
Julio's got a cold and Augusto
hasn't slept through the night for a month.

285
00:25:05,733 --> 00:25:07,166
No, I can't.

286
00:25:09,373 --> 00:25:11,603
I'm sorry, Rico, but I can't.

287
00:25:16,293 --> 00:25:17,408
Okay.

288
00:25:18,933 --> 00:25:22,005
Can you at least help me
put her inside the box?

289
00:25:24,053 --> 00:25:25,168
Sure.

290
00:25:30,933 --> 00:25:33,845
So, cardboard box? Classy.

291
00:25:34,733 --> 00:25:38,931
She obviously didn't think her life was
worth anything, so it makes sense to me.

292
00:25:39,213 --> 00:25:41,681
On three. One, two, three.

293
00:25:46,213 --> 00:25:47,805
It's kind of sad.

294
00:25:48,533 --> 00:25:49,852
It's not.

295
00:25:50,613 --> 00:25:54,447
She threw her fucking life away.
It's not sad. It's pathetic.

296
00:26:09,133 --> 00:26:13,570
We tend to forget how many gifts
God has given each and every one of us...

297
00:26:14,093 --> 00:26:17,369
because our lives
are so filled with distractions...

298
00:26:17,613 --> 00:26:21,003
crowded with messages
competing for our attention...

299
00:26:21,093 --> 00:26:24,005
encouraging us to be unhappy
with our lives.

300
00:26:24,773 --> 00:26:26,889
If only we looked younger...

301
00:26:27,413 --> 00:26:29,131
had perfect skin...

302
00:26:29,733 --> 00:26:31,769
zero body fat.

303
00:26:32,693 --> 00:26:37,483
The truth of the matter is
God loves us just the way we are.

304
00:26:38,853 --> 00:26:43,051
Some people said, "Congratulations.
You've really shaken things up. " Whatever.

305
00:26:43,133 --> 00:26:47,570
Most people in the congregation wouldn't
even make eye contact with me after that.

306
00:26:47,933 --> 00:26:50,322
So now I'm back at St. Stephen's.

307
00:26:56,733 --> 00:26:58,564
So, how are you guys?

308
00:26:59,333 --> 00:27:03,690
-Good. We're good.
-Just got back from a weekend in San Diego.

309
00:27:03,773 --> 00:27:06,241
-Spectacular.
-We went parasailing.

310
00:27:06,613 --> 00:27:09,127
Keith won't admit it,
but he was scared to death.

311
00:27:09,493 --> 00:27:12,610
I was not scared.
Might have had a little rush of adrenaline...

312
00:27:12,693 --> 00:27:14,809
but that's the point, right?

313
00:27:15,133 --> 00:27:18,205
I'll have him hang-gliding
by the end of the year, if it kills me.

314
00:27:18,293 --> 00:27:23,128
In your dreams, fool! I am not breaking
every bone in my body just to impress you.

315
00:27:23,333 --> 00:27:26,609
Seven years I've been hang-gliding.
I never broke anything.

316
00:27:26,693 --> 00:27:29,446
-You're just lucky.
-Don't I know it?

317
00:27:32,613 --> 00:27:36,970
Ladies and gentlemen,
only one of these men will be crowned...

318
00:27:37,093 --> 00:27:40,324
Mr. Gay Black America!

319
00:27:47,933 --> 00:27:49,969
Did I tell you I'm moving?

320
00:27:50,293 --> 00:27:53,444
-Where?
-Same building. A bigger place opened up.

321
00:27:54,533 --> 00:27:56,888
We've been wanting to get a dog.

322
00:27:59,853 --> 00:28:01,047
Great.

323
00:28:06,653 --> 00:28:09,008
Do I seem more tense than usual?

324
00:28:09,293 --> 00:28:13,081
You're not supposed to talk, remember?
It takes us both out of it.

325
00:28:13,973 --> 00:28:18,489
The only conversation is between your body
and my hands.

326
00:28:20,933 --> 00:28:24,209
Correct me if I'm wrong,
but we're on my dime here.

327
00:28:26,653 --> 00:28:31,090
I discovered one of the worst things
about selling 3 million books...

328
00:28:31,573 --> 00:28:35,725
is constantly feeling
like I have to apologize for it, you know?

329
00:28:36,653 --> 00:28:40,805
It's like, "I make a ton of money,
so I must be part of the problem. "

330
00:28:41,253 --> 00:28:44,006
-Yes.
-Yes, what?

331
00:28:44,253 --> 00:28:46,448
You do seem more tense than usual.

332
00:28:46,533 --> 00:28:50,731
I'm not responsible for cancer.
I'm not responsible for world hunger.

333
00:28:50,893 --> 00:28:55,171
What if I'm just happy,
and that's my contribution to the world?

334
00:28:57,933 --> 00:29:00,606
I'm thinking of pitching a book
to my publisher.

335
00:29:00,693 --> 00:29:05,369
Bit of a cultural history,
tracing the how, and the why, and when...

336
00:29:05,533 --> 00:29:08,684
-it became such a sin to be happy.
-Drop.

337
00:29:09,293 --> 00:29:12,046
Who knows, it might help
some of those poor sad fucks...

338
00:29:12,133 --> 00:29:14,727
who are incapable of experiencing joy.

339
00:29:17,133 --> 00:29:20,091
-Get out of my house.
-Excuse me?

340
00:29:20,373 --> 00:29:23,683
-Get the fuck out of my house.
-What is wrong with you?

341
00:29:23,773 --> 00:29:26,128
You don't have any respect for me
or what I do.

342
00:29:26,213 --> 00:29:29,330
I'm just another servant
who has to listen to your bullshit...

343
00:29:29,413 --> 00:29:33,565
and pretend like I don't think you're
the stupid asshole windbag that you are.

344
00:29:34,213 --> 00:29:35,805
You crazy bitch.

345
00:29:36,013 --> 00:29:39,688
I'm paying you for a shiatsu,
and I intend to get a shiatsu.

346
00:29:41,373 --> 00:29:43,728
I don't need your fucking money.

347
00:29:49,093 --> 00:29:52,130
I do not allow people to treat me like this.

348
00:29:52,293 --> 00:29:56,491
Yeah? Well, if you don't
get out of my fucking house right now...

349
00:29:56,573 --> 00:30:00,771
I'll call the LA Times and I'll tell them
about the lipo scars on your ass.

350
00:30:04,173 --> 00:30:05,492
Right now.

351
00:30:06,813 --> 00:30:08,007
Get out!

352
00:30:26,573 --> 00:30:28,768
So this is where the magic happens.

353
00:30:29,373 --> 00:30:30,965
Yeah, this is it.

354
00:30:34,253 --> 00:30:36,209
What's that smell? It's like....

355
00:30:36,373 --> 00:30:39,888
Disinfectant, burnt coffee, embalming fluid.

356
00:30:46,813 --> 00:30:50,692
"For the velvety look and feel
of actual living tissue. "

357
00:30:51,533 --> 00:30:55,811
-No fucking way!
-You do not even want to know.

358
00:30:56,413 --> 00:30:59,769
They have these plastic screws,
only bigger...

359
00:31:00,133 --> 00:31:03,603
that they stick into people's orifices,
so stuff won't spill out.

360
00:31:03,693 --> 00:31:06,969
-That's some kind of fucked up.
-Welcome to my world.

361
00:31:16,653 --> 00:31:19,042
So this is where my brother was?

362
00:31:20,293 --> 00:31:23,763
Jesus, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have
brought you down here.

363
00:31:26,453 --> 00:31:28,762
I'm the one who asked to see it.

364
00:31:41,373 --> 00:31:42,488
What?

365
00:31:42,773 --> 00:31:46,448
You're the first guy I've ever brought home
to meet my family...

366
00:31:47,213 --> 00:31:49,932
and I feel weird, you know? I feel nervous.

367
00:31:52,573 --> 00:31:56,282
Don't worry. I will be on my best behavior.

368
00:31:57,893 --> 00:31:59,372
Okay? Come on.

369
00:32:16,013 --> 00:32:18,129
Your mother is a good woman.

370
00:32:19,253 --> 00:32:22,165
-Yes, we're aware of that.
-David, give him a break.

371
00:32:22,973 --> 00:32:24,725
Sorry, you'll have to excuse my brother.

372
00:32:24,813 --> 00:32:28,123
He's been majorly cranky
ever since he stopped getting laid.

373
00:32:35,573 --> 00:32:38,371
-How old you are?
-Thirty-one.

374
00:32:40,893 --> 00:32:41,882
Good.

375
00:32:44,613 --> 00:32:46,012
I had a son.

376
00:32:46,773 --> 00:32:49,367
He would be a little bit older than you.

377
00:32:51,573 --> 00:32:54,690
He was a student of medicine.

378
00:33:03,853 --> 00:33:06,083
-Look who's here.
-Hello.

379
00:33:25,693 --> 00:33:27,888
I've got major cotton mouth.

380
00:33:31,493 --> 00:33:34,326
-Who wants to say grace?
-I will say grace.

381
00:33:36,533 --> 00:33:39,093
"The poor shall eat, and be filled.

382
00:33:40,373 --> 00:33:43,365
"And those that seek the Lord
shall praise Him.

383
00:33:44,453 --> 00:33:48,048
"Their hearts will live forever and ever.

384
00:33:49,453 --> 00:33:54,322
"Glory be to the Father, and the Son,
and the Holy Spirit...

385
00:33:55,573 --> 00:33:57,723
"both now and forever...

386
00:33:59,053 --> 00:34:01,886
"and unto the ages of ages.

387
00:34:02,493 --> 00:34:03,687
"Amen.

388
00:34:08,573 --> 00:34:10,291
"Lord have mercy.

389
00:34:15,373 --> 00:34:16,772
"Lord, bless.

390
00:34:18,013 --> 00:34:21,210
"O Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God...

391
00:34:22,013 --> 00:34:26,484
"for the sake of the prayers
of thy most pure mother and all the saints...

392
00:34:27,093 --> 00:34:28,765
"have mercy on us.

393
00:34:30,133 --> 00:34:31,282
"Amen. "

394
00:34:37,933 --> 00:34:40,128
Nikolai, you are so beautiful.

395
00:34:41,253 --> 00:34:42,572
Thank you.

396
00:34:42,973 --> 00:34:47,171
You're such a beautiful person.
There is this total light coming out of you.

397
00:34:53,333 --> 00:34:56,882
That's a very unusual compliment, Nate.

398
00:34:57,573 --> 00:35:01,202
-Your brother is high.
-I know, look at his eyes.

399
00:35:06,893 --> 00:35:10,363
-Are you all right?
-I am more than all right.

400
00:35:13,693 --> 00:35:17,402
I haven't felt this good in....
I don't even know how long it's been.

401
00:35:20,173 --> 00:35:21,765
Yes.

402
00:35:23,893 --> 00:35:26,566
You know how long it's been
since I've heard you do that?

403
00:35:26,653 --> 00:35:30,202
Remember when we were first going out,
you used to laugh all the time.

404
00:35:30,293 --> 00:35:32,807
I miss that. Your laughter's like music.

405
00:35:33,893 --> 00:35:35,372
-Nate.
-What?

406
00:35:36,933 --> 00:35:38,525
You're high.

407
00:35:41,573 --> 00:35:42,926
No, I'm not.

408
00:35:44,293 --> 00:35:45,442
Am I?

409
00:35:47,253 --> 00:35:48,971
Look at the light.

410
00:35:53,333 --> 00:35:55,528
Oh, my God, I am high.

411
00:35:57,933 --> 00:35:59,730
I love the little....

412
00:36:00,173 --> 00:36:01,891
They're like halos.

413
00:36:06,573 --> 00:36:08,325
What is he high on?

414
00:36:09,053 --> 00:36:10,645
I wouldn't know.

415
00:36:13,733 --> 00:36:15,405
I am so not hungry.

416
00:36:18,733 --> 00:36:21,850
I think this went pretty good tonight.

417
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:24,368
What are you talking about?

418
00:36:25,013 --> 00:36:28,210
-It was awkward and embarrassing.
-What?

419
00:36:28,813 --> 00:36:31,122
I mean, my son is high on drugs!

420
00:36:31,773 --> 00:36:36,051
What am I supposed to do about that?
Should I intervene? Join a support group?

421
00:36:36,373 --> 00:36:38,887
He just seems happy.

422
00:36:42,093 --> 00:36:44,004
We're going to the movies.

423
00:36:44,693 --> 00:36:47,332
Good night, Mrs. Fisher.
Thank you for dinner.

424
00:36:47,413 --> 00:36:48,766
What movie?

425
00:36:48,853 --> 00:36:51,765
We haven't decided yet,
but we'll be back late.

426
00:36:52,373 --> 00:36:55,012
Mom, you said yourself, we're all adults.

427
00:36:55,373 --> 00:36:57,011
We'll be back late.

428
00:36:59,133 --> 00:37:00,532
Good night.

429
00:37:10,733 --> 00:37:12,485
It's all about flowing.

430
00:37:12,733 --> 00:37:14,212
It flows up, it flows down.

431
00:37:14,293 --> 00:37:17,410
And then, sometimes,
things stop it from flowing. You stay.

432
00:37:17,493 --> 00:37:21,452
It's like you just move in a little pool.

433
00:37:22,613 --> 00:37:24,604
You're like a little eddy.

434
00:37:25,373 --> 00:37:28,683
And that's what it all comes down to.

435
00:37:31,133 --> 00:37:34,967
Everything in my life, every thing....

436
00:37:35,053 --> 00:37:37,851
You know, this thing in my head...

437
00:37:37,933 --> 00:37:40,401
it's all about flow.

438
00:37:43,733 --> 00:37:44,882
Flow?

439
00:37:54,373 --> 00:37:55,965
Oh, my God!

440
00:37:56,973 --> 00:38:00,682
That was so totally you!
That was just so totally David!

441
00:38:03,013 --> 00:38:04,412
I love you.

442
00:38:04,533 --> 00:38:08,492
-Okay, I'm out of here.
-No, you have to take him with you.

443
00:38:08,573 --> 00:38:11,246
Hope I did nothing to fuck you up
when we were kids.

444
00:38:11,333 --> 00:38:13,085
Not when he's like this.

445
00:38:13,293 --> 00:38:15,966
Did you know I taught David
how to masturbate?

446
00:38:16,253 --> 00:38:20,166
No, I didn't, and you know what, Nate?
That's fascinating, but I have to go.

447
00:38:20,253 --> 00:38:23,962
No, just wait a second.
I just want to say goodbye. Come here.

448
00:38:24,933 --> 00:38:26,412
Oh, God!

449
00:38:28,773 --> 00:38:32,209
-I love you so fucking much.
-You're so fucking high.

450
00:38:33,013 --> 00:38:36,323
But how'd I get that way?
You can't just get high out of nowhere.

451
00:38:36,413 --> 00:38:39,723
-You have to take drugs. I didn't take any.
-Did you take any aspirin?

452
00:38:39,853 --> 00:38:41,047
Yeah.

453
00:38:42,053 --> 00:38:44,169
There may have been
a stray tab of Ecstasy...

454
00:38:44,253 --> 00:38:46,892
in the aspirin bottle in the kitchen cabinet.

455
00:38:52,133 --> 00:38:54,772
Oh, dear. You call me when you crash.

456
00:38:55,253 --> 00:38:59,132
No, call me after you crash.
You know what? Call me next week.

457
00:39:08,773 --> 00:39:10,570
I hope you like her.

458
00:39:12,133 --> 00:39:15,648
-It's important to me that you like her.
-I do like her.

459
00:39:16,893 --> 00:39:19,487
'Cause you're the only brother I have.

460
00:39:21,093 --> 00:39:25,166
Time to kiss
your sweet ass goodbye, cupcake.

461
00:39:25,453 --> 00:39:27,125
Yeah, slice her up!

462
00:39:27,853 --> 00:39:29,571
That was hostile.

463
00:39:32,173 --> 00:39:34,846
Isn't that the girl that you guys are burying?

464
00:39:35,213 --> 00:39:38,410
-She's hot.
-She's hot and dead.

465
00:39:41,773 --> 00:39:43,365
This calls for someone with experience.

466
00:39:43,453 --> 00:39:45,648
Someone who knows her way
around Griffith Park.

467
00:39:45,733 --> 00:39:48,088
-That's me.
-In the daytime.

468
00:39:49,893 --> 00:39:51,087
You gotta love her.

469
00:39:51,173 --> 00:39:54,927
In fact, if God gave me the ingredients
and told me to make a woman...

470
00:39:55,933 --> 00:39:57,685
I'd make her just like my wife.

471
00:40:01,973 --> 00:40:06,285
They lost no time in tucking into
the wonderful meal Boris had prepared.

472
00:40:06,373 --> 00:40:08,967
And then there was a dessert.

473
00:40:09,053 --> 00:40:13,331
I guess Boris knows I always like to have
lettuce for dessert, don't you, Boris?

474
00:40:13,453 --> 00:40:17,241
I hope the meal was satisfactory.

475
00:40:17,853 --> 00:40:21,732
It was delightful, Boris!
You're a wonderful cook.

476
00:40:22,213 --> 00:40:26,001
It was nothing, Martha.
Straight out of the cookbook.

477
00:40:27,293 --> 00:40:30,046
It's yummy, Boris.
I couldn't eat another thing.

478
00:40:30,533 --> 00:40:33,001
Yeah, it's not bad for a first effort.

479
00:40:35,933 --> 00:40:36,968
Fuck.

480
00:41:23,213 --> 00:41:24,566
Buddy boy!

481
00:41:34,333 --> 00:41:36,563
Come on, saved a place for you.

482
00:41:42,053 --> 00:41:43,725
Chinese checkers.

483
00:41:45,293 --> 00:41:49,047
-I always hated this game.
-That's because you never played for money.

484
00:41:53,013 --> 00:41:56,130
Nate, I want you to meet
a couple of friends of mine.

485
00:41:58,093 --> 00:42:00,402
Well, honey, this is the man.

486
00:42:01,693 --> 00:42:02,842
Death.

487
00:42:04,733 --> 00:42:06,325
The Grim Reaper.

488
00:42:07,013 --> 00:42:08,207
Cigar?

489
00:42:09,133 --> 00:42:12,967
-No, thanks.
-Good for you, baby. That stuff is nasty.

490
00:42:14,613 --> 00:42:16,205
-And this is...
-My partner.

491
00:42:16,893 --> 00:42:19,691
That sounds so professional. I love it.

492
00:42:21,053 --> 00:42:23,647
-Life.
-Shut up.

493
00:42:23,813 --> 00:42:27,010
Oh, yeah, it's a whole yin-yang thing.

494
00:42:27,093 --> 00:42:29,891
You telling me
you two are in business together?

495
00:42:29,973 --> 00:42:33,170
Honey, me and him
are in all kinds of shit together!

496
00:42:33,253 --> 00:42:37,326
Let's just say
it's a mutually beneficial arrangement.

497
00:42:38,533 --> 00:42:40,012
It's your turn.

498
00:42:42,453 --> 00:42:44,603
Shouldn't I wait for you
to start a new game?

499
00:42:44,693 --> 00:42:47,002
This game ain't never gonna end.

500
00:42:47,333 --> 00:42:51,212
You're either in the game, or you're out of it.

501
00:42:51,973 --> 00:42:54,441
"On or off the bus," if you prefer.

502
00:42:55,653 --> 00:42:57,166
All right, I'm in.

503
00:43:00,493 --> 00:43:03,166
You gotta put something in the kitty, son.

504
00:43:03,693 --> 00:43:05,968
-What are you betting?
-Everything.

505
00:43:06,133 --> 00:43:09,330
All right, I'll bet everything. Whatever.

506
00:43:20,893 --> 00:43:23,202
-I'm shaking.
-Hey, buddy boy, no.

507
00:43:23,293 --> 00:43:25,761
You don't wanna get this guy mad,
believe me.

508
00:43:25,853 --> 00:43:28,925
I don't get mad.
I have people who do it for me.

509
00:43:38,173 --> 00:43:39,242
Showoff!

510
00:43:39,893 --> 00:43:43,329
But that always gets me going.

511
00:43:45,293 --> 00:43:47,568
You wanna fuck me, puppet head?

512
00:43:58,213 --> 00:43:59,362
Momma!

513
00:44:01,733 --> 00:44:04,850
Yeah, baby! That's it.

514
00:44:06,213 --> 00:44:08,283
Go to town, big daddy!

515
00:44:15,693 --> 00:44:19,572
Big cosmic mystery.
Right here, right in front of you.

516
00:44:20,413 --> 00:44:24,167
You can't say your old man
never took you any place interesting.

517
00:44:24,933 --> 00:44:26,571
Yeah, but I'm high.

518
00:44:29,133 --> 00:44:30,486
I know I'm high.

519
00:44:33,253 --> 00:44:36,290
"All that lives, lives forever.

520
00:44:37,453 --> 00:44:40,365
"Only the shell,
the perishable passes away. "

521
00:44:40,453 --> 00:44:41,602
Fuck, yeah.

522
00:44:42,213 --> 00:44:45,888
"The spirit is without end. Eternal.

523
00:44:47,773 --> 00:44:49,172
"Deathless. "

524
00:44:51,613 --> 00:44:53,922
Now take this over here and....

525
00:44:57,093 --> 00:45:00,210
Look at that, folks.
Look at that for a holiday dinner.

526
00:45:01,613 --> 00:45:05,811
If we had some mint jelly,
that would be fabulous.

527
00:45:05,893 --> 00:45:07,565
-Unbelievable!
-Smell that.

528
00:45:08,453 --> 00:45:10,444
So all I get to do is smell it?

529
00:45:12,493 --> 00:45:14,370
-Show them.
-Smell this.

530
00:45:14,773 --> 00:45:17,128
-Isn't that wonderful?
-Oh, boy!

531
00:45:29,413 --> 00:45:32,246
-Hello?
-Oh, no, did I wake you?

532
00:45:35,373 --> 00:45:37,967
Yeah, you did. What's up?

533
00:45:39,853 --> 00:45:42,287
I just wanted to thank you
for inviting me out...

534
00:45:42,373 --> 00:45:45,729
-with you and Eddie yesterday after church.
-Okay.

535
00:45:46,693 --> 00:45:48,490
And to tell you that...

536
00:45:48,693 --> 00:45:51,890
it's really important to me
that we've remained friends.

537
00:45:54,173 --> 00:45:58,451
If you'd ever like to do something,
just the two of us, I'd really like that.

538
00:45:59,973 --> 00:46:02,931
Look, David, I'm happy that we're friends...

539
00:46:03,853 --> 00:46:06,492
but I'm in a relationship. A good one.

540
00:46:07,973 --> 00:46:11,966
-I know.
-You and me, it ain't happening.

541
00:46:13,253 --> 00:46:17,644
Yeah, I know that. It's just kind of hard
for me to be around you and Eddie together.

542
00:46:17,933 --> 00:46:19,685
You need to get over that.

543
00:46:19,933 --> 00:46:23,482
Jesus, Keith, could you be
a little more self-righteous?

544
00:46:36,253 --> 00:46:38,813
-Good morning, Mom.
-You're up early.

545
00:46:39,253 --> 00:46:42,529
I've been having trouble sleeping recently.
Not sure why.

546
00:46:52,133 --> 00:46:53,725
Where's Nikolai?

547
00:46:54,453 --> 00:46:56,762
-Home.
-He didn't stay over?

548
00:46:57,773 --> 00:46:59,331
Of course not.

549
00:47:02,573 --> 00:47:04,086
You know, Mom...

550
00:47:04,573 --> 00:47:08,168
if you did want for him to stay over,
that would be your right.

551
00:47:08,653 --> 00:47:12,965
-I know that. I don't need your permission.
-No, you don't. Nor do I need yours.

552
00:47:15,533 --> 00:47:17,091
Of course not.

553
00:47:20,533 --> 00:47:23,525
You had a terrible time last night,
didn't you?

554
00:47:27,333 --> 00:47:28,561
Kind of.

555
00:47:31,133 --> 00:47:34,125
I did it for you. Arranged the whole evening.

556
00:47:34,373 --> 00:47:36,887
-Why?
-Some stupid book told me to.

557
00:47:36,973 --> 00:47:39,441
-Throw that book away.
-I intend to.

558
00:47:42,333 --> 00:47:46,690
Does Nate have a problem with drugs now?
Is this something I need to know about?

559
00:47:46,973 --> 00:47:48,964
I think he took it by accident.

560
00:47:49,053 --> 00:47:51,965
How can something like that
be an accident?

561
00:47:57,293 --> 00:48:01,332
Rebecca Milford's star shone all too briefly.

562
00:48:02,093 --> 00:48:04,163
But, oh, how brightly it shone.

563
00:48:05,133 --> 00:48:07,010
This is really boring.

564
00:48:08,093 --> 00:48:10,402
How very, very brightly indeed.

565
00:48:11,333 --> 00:48:13,767
No, it's hilarious, is what it is.

566
00:48:15,053 --> 00:48:16,725
Gabe, a girl died.

567
00:48:17,893 --> 00:48:20,487
So what? Everybody dies.

568
00:48:28,533 --> 00:48:32,890
How did Ecstasy get in the aspirin bottle?
Is that Claire's idea of a joke?

569
00:48:33,413 --> 00:48:36,052
I think I might have left it in there.

570
00:48:38,813 --> 00:48:42,567
-Where did you get it?
-You remember the square-dancing guy?

571
00:48:47,653 --> 00:48:50,247
Do you think you could get some more?

572
00:48:57,533 --> 00:48:59,922
I wrote something about Becky...

573
00:49:00,693 --> 00:49:03,526
that I'd like to share with everyone here.

574
00:49:12,053 --> 00:49:14,647
Tiny Venus

575
00:49:15,813 --> 00:49:21,171
Your breath like baby rabbits on a field

576
00:49:21,613 --> 00:49:26,733
abuzz with bees and life

577
00:49:28,253 --> 00:49:30,323
Little did you know

578
00:49:30,413 --> 00:49:35,168
How briefly the sun would shine upon

579
00:49:35,653 --> 00:49:39,566
your own private Utopia

580
00:49:40,533 --> 00:49:45,448
Your candle may have been blown out

581
00:49:46,213 --> 00:49:50,923
but you hang in the air

582
00:49:51,293 --> 00:49:55,411
like smoke

583
00:49:58,213 --> 00:50:00,169
Right on. That's my man.

584
00:50:07,373 --> 00:50:09,568
What are you doing down here?

585
00:50:12,173 --> 00:50:15,609
It was a stupid idea
of me to go to a funeral for fun.

586
00:50:18,213 --> 00:50:20,568
Yeah, I tried to tell you that.

587
00:50:21,973 --> 00:50:24,487
-Okay, so you were right.
-Are you okay?

588
00:50:24,573 --> 00:50:26,803
I'm fine. Why do you have to...

589
00:50:27,293 --> 00:50:30,842
-I'm not a pet! I'm not your pet!
-I'm sorry.

590
00:50:31,693 --> 00:50:33,206
I'm going home.

591
00:50:37,533 --> 00:50:40,605
You said you guys were
all pitching in together to pay for this.

592
00:50:40,693 --> 00:50:43,605
Yeah, I paid my $600,
and I'm not paying a penny more.

593
00:50:43,693 --> 00:50:45,763
Do you know how rude that girl was to me?

594
00:50:45,853 --> 00:50:47,969
You know how this is gonna make me look?

595
00:50:48,053 --> 00:50:52,285
So? Go talk to Brody. He's the one who
supposedly can't come up with his share.

596
00:50:52,453 --> 00:50:54,762
-You brought this funeral here.
-So?

597
00:50:54,853 --> 00:50:58,050
So maybe you need to come up
with the difference.

598
00:50:59,333 --> 00:51:01,483
Maybe you need to get off my case...

599
00:51:01,573 --> 00:51:05,566
considering I just gave your wife $500
so she can pay for fucking diapers!

600
00:51:07,213 --> 00:51:10,046
-What are you talking about?
-You heard me.

601
00:51:10,533 --> 00:51:14,162
-What the fuck are you talking about?
-She asked me for it.

602
00:51:33,933 --> 00:51:35,685
What are you doing?

603
00:51:38,293 --> 00:51:42,172
This way, she'll always be a part of us.

604
00:51:43,693 --> 00:51:47,971
You fucking moron.
You're all fucking morons.

605
00:51:49,373 --> 00:51:53,048
You are all such incredibly stupid losers!

606
00:51:53,813 --> 00:51:55,724
-Chill.
-You people are fucking disgusting!

607
00:51:55,813 --> 00:51:58,043
-Who the hell are you?
-Fucking bunch of junkies!

608
00:51:58,133 --> 00:52:00,886
-This is not cool.
-Did you see what these people are doing?

609
00:52:00,973 --> 00:52:03,612
I know, but this is our business,
these are our clients.

610
00:52:03,693 --> 00:52:05,092
They can do whatever they want.

611
00:52:05,173 --> 00:52:09,132
We'll see you back here real soon, okay?
And we'll be snorting you next time!

612
00:52:12,013 --> 00:52:14,368
"All that lives, lives forever.

613
00:52:15,053 --> 00:52:18,932
"Only the shell, the perishable passes away.

614
00:52:20,893 --> 00:52:23,771
"The spirit is without end. Eternal.

615
00:52:23,853 --> 00:52:25,206
"Deathless. "

616
00:52:27,653 --> 00:52:29,644
It's the Bhagavad-Gita.

617
00:52:31,253 --> 00:52:32,481
Really?

618
00:52:36,293 --> 00:52:38,727
-I never read it.
-You read it at my house.

619
00:52:38,813 --> 00:52:42,965
-I don't think so.
-Don't you remember? I went on and on...

620
00:52:43,053 --> 00:52:46,648
about the Peter Brook production
of The Mahabharata in London?

621
00:52:51,693 --> 00:52:56,130
But it felt so profound. Are you telling me
it's just recycled crap from my brain?

622
00:52:56,213 --> 00:52:58,363
From your drug-addled brain.

623
00:53:07,173 --> 00:53:08,322
Hello?

624
00:53:08,893 --> 00:53:12,681
So were you just not going to tell me
or did you just forget?

625
00:53:12,773 --> 00:53:14,206
Forget what?

626
00:53:15,013 --> 00:53:17,129
A certain test you took recently.

627
00:53:19,213 --> 00:53:23,365
They posted the results today.
Congratulations, Mr. Funeral Director.

628
00:53:27,533 --> 00:53:29,524
You gotta be shitting me.

629
00:53:29,853 --> 00:53:34,131
I'm looking at your name, plain as day.
"Nathaniel Samuel Fisher, Jr. "

630
00:53:35,013 --> 00:53:37,846
You know, I had totally forgotten about that.

631
00:53:40,973 --> 00:53:42,929
I'm proud of you, Nate.

632
00:53:44,613 --> 00:53:45,807
Thanks.

633
00:53:47,693 --> 00:53:49,411
I'll see you later.

634
00:53:52,013 --> 00:53:55,562
-Where are you going?
-I have a client at 8:30.

635
00:53:56,733 --> 00:54:00,089
-That's a little late, isn't it?
-No, it's not that late.

636
00:54:01,613 --> 00:54:03,444
Can I come over later?

637
00:54:05,093 --> 00:54:06,811
Not tonight, okay?

638
00:54:10,173 --> 00:54:14,007
I'm having enough trouble
just being with myself right now.

639
00:54:14,773 --> 00:54:16,764
I'm sorry. It's not you.

640
00:54:19,493 --> 00:54:21,927
It's me. I'm fucked up.

641
00:54:27,933 --> 00:54:29,605
And you can't fix it.

642
00:55:55,133 --> 00:55:57,567
You're in the game now, buddy boy...

643
00:55:58,573 --> 00:56:00,689
whether you like it or not.

644
00:57:25,853 --> 00:57:27,650
English
