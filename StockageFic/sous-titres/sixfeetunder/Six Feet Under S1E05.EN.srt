1
00:01:51,575 --> 00:01:55,966
So I want you to meet this guy
I'm going out with tonight. Okay?

2
00:01:57,974 --> 00:02:01,728
He's kind of a dork,
but in a sweet way.

3
00:02:01,934 --> 00:02:04,494
He seems real, at least.

4
00:02:04,694 --> 00:02:07,605
And he's kind of rich, I think.
Kind of.

5
00:02:07,813 --> 00:02:13,126
Of course, so was Kadeem, and that was
a fucking waste of two years of my life.

6
00:02:16,932 --> 00:02:21,244
And you know what?
I knew you never liked Kadeem.

7
00:02:22,212 --> 00:02:24,486
So I'm gonna bring this guy
home to meet you.

8
00:02:24,691 --> 00:02:26,283
And this time...

9
00:02:26,491 --> 00:02:31,281
...I swear I will pay attention
to what you think.

10
00:02:32,211 --> 00:02:35,407
Because I am
one fucking hot-shit bitch...

11
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:38,727
...and he'd be fucking lucky to have me.

12
00:02:59,168 --> 00:03:01,920
Oh, does that feel good.

13
00:03:07,767 --> 00:03:10,042
Hey, Tito!

14
00:03:10,247 --> 00:03:13,124
Come hang with me. Okay?

15
00:03:16,126 --> 00:03:17,684
Thank you.

16
00:03:17,886 --> 00:03:21,434
Who's my lover?
Yes.

17
00:03:24,725 --> 00:03:27,956
Yes. Aren't you glad I rescued you?

18
00:03:28,165 --> 00:03:33,318
You better be fucking glad.
Cost me 800 bucks in vet bills...

19
00:03:33,564 --> 00:03:38,797
...at a time when things were particularly
tight for Mommy, I might add.

20
00:03:40,243 --> 00:03:42,473
One good thing about this guy tonight...

21
00:03:42,683 --> 00:03:46,517
...is, he's got a big, fat dick,
and he fucks like a jackhammer.

22
00:03:50,482 --> 00:03:52,950
Those never last.

23
00:05:04,834 --> 00:05:07,268
David, I'm so glad to see you here.

24
00:05:07,474 --> 00:05:09,510
It's always nice when someone
comes back.

25
00:05:09,754 --> 00:05:13,746
Oh, I've been going to church.
I was just going to a different church.

26
00:05:13,953 --> 00:05:16,228
- Really, which one?
- St. Stephen's.

27
00:05:16,473 --> 00:05:21,103
- In the Palisades?
- No, St. Stephen's in West Hollywood.

28
00:05:22,512 --> 00:05:26,949
Well, I hope you always feel
as welcome here as you did there.

29
00:05:27,152 --> 00:05:29,268
- Thanks.
- Your father was a deacon here...

30
00:05:29,472 --> 00:05:31,223
...and we still haven't replaced him.

31
00:05:31,431 --> 00:05:34,662
I think it would be good for this church
to listen to a younger voice.

32
00:05:34,871 --> 00:05:37,305
If you're at all interested,
I could submit your name.

33
00:05:37,511 --> 00:05:39,900
Me? A deacon?

34
00:05:40,111 --> 00:05:44,149
David, that's wonderful.
Your father would be so proud.

35
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:47,667
Well, sure, I'd be honored
to be considered.

36
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:51,782
- Ruth, how are you holding up?
- I'm doing okay, Father.

37
00:05:52,029 --> 00:05:56,386
- Each day is just a little bit easier.
- That's what I love hearing.

38
00:05:56,589 --> 00:05:59,625
Wow, what a small world!
Do you go to this church?

39
00:05:59,828 --> 00:06:04,299
I just joined. I was raised Catholic,
so I like the whole ritual part of it.

40
00:06:04,508 --> 00:06:06,544
You smell good. What is that?

41
00:06:06,748 --> 00:06:08,227
Who are you?

42
00:06:08,428 --> 00:06:11,544
Oh, my God. I can't believe
I never introduced myself.

43
00:06:11,747 --> 00:06:15,786
It seems like we've known each other
forever. I'm Tracy Montrose Blair.

44
00:06:15,987 --> 00:06:19,376
- Hi, I'm David...
- Fisher, I know. I know who you are.

45
00:06:19,586 --> 00:06:20,575
Okay. Why?

46
00:06:20,826 --> 00:06:24,182
Because my Uncle Walt
was buried at your funeral home.

47
00:06:24,946 --> 00:06:27,413
Old guy? Cancer?

48
00:06:27,665 --> 00:06:29,940
Had a tattoo of a roulette wheel
on his back?

49
00:06:30,145 --> 00:06:31,294
Oh, yes.

50
00:06:31,825 --> 00:06:35,261
I have a tattoo.
A butterfly.

51
00:06:35,905 --> 00:06:38,816
I think that you should know
that I'm not really available.

52
00:06:39,064 --> 00:06:41,498
- You have a girlfriend?
- Yes.

53
00:06:42,264 --> 00:06:44,937
- Serious?
- We're engaged.

54
00:06:45,144 --> 00:06:48,579
Well, good for you.

55
00:06:48,983 --> 00:06:51,781
Most men your age are so
commitment-phobic, it's pathetic.

56
00:06:52,103 --> 00:06:55,140
- Yes, men are pigs.
- Or they're gay.

57
00:06:55,342 --> 00:06:58,061
Well, I'm certainly glad
to find out you're not gay.

58
00:06:58,262 --> 00:07:00,935
I have to go. My mother's waiting.

59
00:07:02,582 --> 00:07:04,095
Bye-bye!

60
00:07:04,581 --> 00:07:08,290
- She seems nice.
- She seems nuts.

61
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:20,378
Hello?

62
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:23,451
Out here!

63
00:07:26,019 --> 00:07:26,974
Hey.

64
00:07:27,219 --> 00:07:29,813
- This is the life, huh?
- Apparently.

65
00:07:30,059 --> 00:07:32,095
So how often do Mommy and Daddy
go away?

66
00:07:32,299 --> 00:07:35,290
Oh, constantly.
They're very important people...

67
00:07:35,538 --> 00:07:37,847
...with very important places to go.

68
00:07:38,058 --> 00:07:41,528
Lucky for them, I have
absolutely nowhere to go.

69
00:07:42,137 --> 00:07:43,650
- How are you?
- I'm good.

70
00:07:43,897 --> 00:07:46,650
- It's chilly today. Aren't you cold?
- Nope.

71
00:07:49,057 --> 00:07:50,649
Jesus, it's like a hot tub in here.

72
00:07:50,897 --> 00:07:54,889
Mommy and Daddy keep it
this hot all the time, even in summer.

73
00:07:55,096 --> 00:07:57,246
They're very wasteful.

74
00:07:58,456 --> 00:08:00,048
That's just wrong.

75
00:08:07,335 --> 00:08:11,043
Oh, man, you are...

76
00:08:11,494 --> 00:08:13,291
What?

77
00:08:13,734 --> 00:08:15,645
You're unlike any woman
I've ever met.

78
00:08:15,854 --> 00:08:17,731
Good.

79
00:08:27,093 --> 00:08:30,243
- You scare me a little.
- Why?

80
00:08:31,892 --> 00:08:33,610
I don't know.

81
00:08:33,812 --> 00:08:36,007
It's just...

82
00:08:36,412 --> 00:08:39,289
...so much I don't know about you.

83
00:08:40,371 --> 00:08:41,929
Me?

84
00:08:43,211 --> 00:08:46,840
I am an open book.

85
00:09:00,529 --> 00:09:02,599
I'm so glad you're bringing
your friends home.

86
00:09:02,809 --> 00:09:05,004
You know, you haven't
done that in years.

87
00:09:05,209 --> 00:09:07,483
You said you'd be gone
through the weekend.

88
00:09:08,048 --> 00:09:12,041
Yes, it's Sunday.
It's the end of the weekend.

89
00:09:12,248 --> 00:09:16,763
Nate, these are my parents,
Margaret and Bernard Chenowith.

90
00:09:16,967 --> 00:09:22,963
Margaret and Bernard, this is Nate Fisher,
the man I am having sex with.

91
00:09:24,127 --> 00:09:25,639
Hello.

92
00:09:26,246 --> 00:09:29,636
Brenda has told us absolutely nothing
about you.

93
00:09:29,846 --> 00:09:33,282
You know what? I'm not surprised.
I'm not sure there's that much to tell.

94
00:09:33,486 --> 00:09:35,282
Oh, don't be so modest.

95
00:09:35,485 --> 00:09:38,283
Nate's studying for
his funeral director's license.

96
00:09:38,485 --> 00:09:41,045
Well, Nate, you'll have to tell us
all about that.

97
00:09:41,245 --> 00:09:43,599
- Will you stay for lunch?
- At least a drink or two?

98
00:09:43,844 --> 00:09:47,314
I'd like to, but...

99
00:09:47,964 --> 00:09:50,524
...I really have to study.

100
00:09:52,164 --> 00:09:55,838
Well, then you'll have to join us
for dinner sometime.

101
00:09:58,163 --> 00:10:00,313
That sounds great.

102
00:10:01,643 --> 00:10:03,553
Great!

103
00:10:07,562 --> 00:10:09,837
Okay, Mrs. Fisher.

104
00:10:10,042 --> 00:10:16,389
I asked you here today so we could
talk about your relationship with Claire.

105
00:10:16,761 --> 00:10:19,833
- I told her it wasn't my idea.
- No.

106
00:10:20,041 --> 00:10:22,429
Claire feels that,
being the youngest child...

107
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:27,515
...perhaps she might have missed out
on a time when the family was happier.

108
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,392
No, you said that.

109
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,432
I don't think there was a time
this family was ever happy.

110
00:10:32,639 --> 00:10:35,278
That is not true.
There was lots of happiness:

111
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:39,511
When the boys were young,
when you were young, Claire.

112
00:10:39,718 --> 00:10:42,437
You were a very happy little girl,
and you know it.

113
00:10:42,638 --> 00:10:45,596
That's because I was too young
to realize what freaks we were.

114
00:10:45,798 --> 00:10:48,437
Why would you tell this man
we were never happy?

115
00:10:48,638 --> 00:10:52,107
Because I grew up in a house that was
usually filled with total strangers...

116
00:10:52,317 --> 00:10:55,036
...who were crying all the time?
- Oh, boo-hoo.

117
00:10:55,437 --> 00:10:58,155
I grew up in a two-room apartment
over a barbershop...

118
00:10:58,356 --> 00:11:00,995
...and I spent my teenage years
taking care of my grandmother...

119
00:11:01,196 --> 00:11:03,505
...after her legs were amputated.
Life's hard!

120
00:11:03,756 --> 00:11:06,828
You had a roof over your head.
You didn't go hungry.

121
00:11:07,076 --> 00:11:10,067
She gets up on this cross,
and then there's just no talking to her.

122
00:11:10,275 --> 00:11:13,312
You did not have to go begging
for food on the streets of Calcutta.

123
00:11:13,515 --> 00:11:16,984
Because I wasn't dropped in a dumpster,
I shouldn't want things to be better?

124
00:11:17,194 --> 00:11:20,948
This is good. This is good
for you two to talk like this.

125
00:11:21,154 --> 00:11:25,113
These are obviously things
you need to say.

126
00:11:25,314 --> 00:11:28,191
So we're just supposed to fight
and get on each other's nerves?

127
00:11:28,393 --> 00:11:29,826
I prefer the not-talking thing.

128
00:11:30,073 --> 00:11:33,543
I think you should try to
have more of a dialogue.

129
00:11:33,753 --> 00:11:38,507
Make time for it. Schedule it.
Remember, any relationship is work.

130
00:11:41,512 --> 00:11:44,151
Okay, excellent session.

131
00:11:44,951 --> 00:11:47,590
- That's it?
- That's up to you, isn't it?

132
00:11:50,831 --> 00:11:53,629
He does this for like
five different schools.

133
00:11:56,350 --> 00:12:01,026
She should look spectacular.
That's the most important thing.

134
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:04,700
We'll make sure that she looks her best.

135
00:12:05,749 --> 00:12:10,425
She was the real deal, you know?
She was a star.

136
00:12:10,629 --> 00:12:13,700
And I can assure you
we will give her a funeral...

137
00:12:13,908 --> 00:12:16,786
...that befits the star that she was
and always will be.

138
00:12:17,028 --> 00:12:20,338
- You know who she was?
- Absolutely.

139
00:12:20,548 --> 00:12:23,584
And I'm a big fan of hers.

140
00:12:27,467 --> 00:12:29,423
Hey, Rico.

141
00:12:29,627 --> 00:12:32,265
- Holy moly.
- Feel them.

142
00:12:32,466 --> 00:12:34,821
- They're really hard.
- No, thanks.

143
00:12:35,066 --> 00:12:38,945
Like a rock.
See how they're all cockeyed?

144
00:12:39,466 --> 00:12:44,619
They got this low-cut thing they want
her in, and they said absolutely no bra.

145
00:12:44,825 --> 00:12:47,339
Shit, I don't know what
the heck I'm gonna do.

146
00:12:47,545 --> 00:12:49,900
Maybe I could, like,
tape them together somehow.

147
00:12:50,105 --> 00:12:53,062
You know where this goes? I put it
in the wrong place, David will bitch.

148
00:12:53,264 --> 00:12:55,653
Top left, above the purple stuff.

149
00:12:56,864 --> 00:13:00,299
Well, boys, this just might be our
highest profit margin funeral this year.

150
00:13:00,503 --> 00:13:03,063
- She's rich, huh?
- The guy who's paying for it is.

151
00:13:03,263 --> 00:13:08,018
- She looks so familiar to me.
- She's an actress. Viveca St. John.

152
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:11,294
Oh, my God, you're right.
That's her!

153
00:13:11,662 --> 00:13:15,621
- Apparently, she was quite talented.
- She was a porno star.

154
00:13:15,822 --> 00:13:18,858
- What?
- She was huge in the mid to late '80s.

155
00:13:19,061 --> 00:13:20,494
You never saw any of her videos?

156
00:13:20,741 --> 00:13:23,619
- No, Nate, I missed those.
- This chick fucked a snake.

157
00:13:23,821 --> 00:13:27,450
- This chick fucked 30 guys at one time.
- I saw that. I saw that!

158
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:29,651
My cousin Ramone showed me
when I was like 12.

159
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:32,937
On the diving board. Okay?
They were wrapped around the pool.

160
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:36,371
Did you see the one where the guy's
riding this motorcycle, so he's...

161
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:39,013
...fucking her while riding in circles?
- Oh, shit!

162
00:13:39,219 --> 00:13:40,891
Nate.

163
00:13:41,099 --> 00:13:43,408
Could I speak to you
outside for a minute?

164
00:13:51,978 --> 00:13:55,970
Damn it, Nate! The woman on that table
is just as deserving of dignity...

165
00:13:56,217 --> 00:13:57,809
...as anyone else we prepare.

166
00:13:58,417 --> 00:14:00,089
And Federico is an employee.

167
00:14:00,297 --> 00:14:03,289
It's up to you and me to set
an example for him, all right?

168
00:14:03,737 --> 00:14:06,091
- All right, I'm sorry.
- Show some respect.

169
00:14:06,296 --> 00:14:08,366
These are human lives
we're dealing with here.

170
00:14:08,576 --> 00:14:11,215
These are not organic blackberries
or granola in bulk.

171
00:14:11,416 --> 00:14:14,055
- I said, I'm sorry.
- I don't want you to be sorry.

172
00:14:14,255 --> 00:14:16,815
I want you to remember
that what we do here is serious...

173
00:14:17,015 --> 00:14:20,166
...because it really sucks for me
always having to be the spoilsport.

174
00:14:20,375 --> 00:14:21,933
Okay.

175
00:14:22,135 --> 00:14:23,250
Thank you.

176
00:14:31,454 --> 00:14:34,092
- Hello?
- Nate, Bernard Chenowith,

177
00:14:34,293 --> 00:14:35,248
Hi.

178
00:14:35,493 --> 00:14:39,088
Margaret and I were wondering if you
would join us for dinner tomorrow night.

179
00:14:39,293 --> 00:14:41,602
- We won't take no for an answer.
- You hear that?

180
00:14:42,372 --> 00:14:45,762
Well, actually I have a lot of
studying to do for this exam...

181
00:14:45,972 --> 00:14:47,325
Nate...

182
00:14:47,532 --> 00:14:50,569
...we'd really love to be able
to get a sense of who you are...

183
00:14:50,772 --> 00:14:53,524
...and I'm sure you're curious
about us as well, right?

184
00:14:53,731 --> 00:14:56,803
Good. Shall we say 7-ish?

185
00:14:57,051 --> 00:14:58,848
Can I bring anything?

186
00:15:00,491 --> 00:15:01,843
Hello?

187
00:15:10,529 --> 00:15:13,566
Suck on that, you ugly fuck!

188
00:15:21,488 --> 00:15:22,557
Hi.

189
00:15:22,768 --> 00:15:27,000
There's this thing called knocking. It's,
like, protected in the First Amendment.

190
00:15:27,208 --> 00:15:29,323
I rented some videos.

191
00:15:29,527 --> 00:15:32,246
I thought you and I could
watch them tonight.

192
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:35,764
Remember when you
were in middle school...

193
00:15:35,967 --> 00:15:38,560
...you and I went to the movies
every Monday night?

194
00:15:38,766 --> 00:15:40,518
Remember how much fun we had?

195
00:15:40,726 --> 00:15:43,798
I remember seeing a lot
of really bad movies.

196
00:15:47,486 --> 00:15:49,715
What'd you get?

197
00:15:50,245 --> 00:15:55,160
Runaway Bride
and The Nutty Professor.

198
00:15:57,484 --> 00:15:59,122
Cool.

199
00:16:02,124 --> 00:16:05,560
Oz didn't make you a bitch,

200
00:16:05,764 --> 00:16:08,231
You were born one,

201
00:16:14,283 --> 00:16:17,991
It'd be good for business too.
Dad was a deacon there.

202
00:16:18,202 --> 00:16:21,160
It's a big congregation. People die.

203
00:16:21,362 --> 00:16:24,638
Their families don't know where to go,
and the church sends them our way.

204
00:16:24,842 --> 00:16:26,957
They know you're gay?

205
00:16:27,161 --> 00:16:30,995
I think Father Jack
has a pretty good idea.

206
00:16:31,201 --> 00:16:34,556
- You think he likes you?
- Keith.

207
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:39,070
Does this mean you're not gonna be
going to church with me anymore?

208
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:44,590
Well, if they make me a deacon,
I'd have to go there all the time, yeah.

209
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:51,468
I'm sorry. I know.
Sundays have sort of been our day.

210
00:16:55,918 --> 00:16:58,955
I think it's great. I really do.

211
00:16:59,158 --> 00:17:01,069
One of the things I love about you...

212
00:17:01,318 --> 00:17:04,832
...is the fact that your religion
means so much to you.

213
00:17:05,037 --> 00:17:07,426
Besides, I think it could be
kind of hot, you know?

214
00:17:07,637 --> 00:17:10,310
Dating a man of the cloth?

215
00:17:14,836 --> 00:17:19,148
- But I need you to do something for me.
- What is it, my son?

216
00:17:19,356 --> 00:17:22,745
You know the gay firemen
and police officers club I belong to?

217
00:17:22,955 --> 00:17:25,230
Well, we're having a party
in Laguna this weekend.

218
00:17:25,435 --> 00:17:29,348
- I want you to be my date.
- Your date? Will I get a corsage?

219
00:17:29,555 --> 00:17:32,626
I want you to start meeting
some of my friends, David.

220
00:17:33,154 --> 00:17:35,110
I'd like that.

221
00:17:37,154 --> 00:17:41,749
Forgive me, Father,
for I am about to sin.

222
00:17:57,352 --> 00:18:00,343
This is an entire movie
about expelling gas.

223
00:18:00,551 --> 00:18:03,429
I think that's why people like it.

224
00:18:05,311 --> 00:18:09,542
- I don't want to watch this.
- Good, because neither do I.

225
00:18:19,069 --> 00:18:20,821
Claire, look...

226
00:18:21,989 --> 00:18:24,867
...I know you probably think
I'm old and stupid.

227
00:18:25,069 --> 00:18:26,820
No, Mom, I don't.

228
00:18:27,028 --> 00:18:29,144
But I love you just as much
as I ever did...

229
00:18:29,348 --> 00:18:31,942
...and I'm worried about you,
and I don't know how to help.

230
00:18:32,188 --> 00:18:33,985
I don't need help.

231
00:18:34,188 --> 00:18:36,747
Why is everyone acting like
I'm in the Trenchcoat Mafia?

232
00:18:36,947 --> 00:18:41,179
- You stole a foot. A human foot!
- Okay, you want to know why?

233
00:18:41,387 --> 00:18:44,424
Because some guy who scammed me
into having sex with him...

234
00:18:44,667 --> 00:18:48,784
...because I thought he cared about me,
told the entire school I sucked his toes.

235
00:18:49,026 --> 00:18:52,098
And then when I confronted him,
he showed entirely no remorse.

236
00:18:52,306 --> 00:18:56,264
I saw Nate drop the foot on the floor.
I grabbed it to get back at that asshole.

237
00:18:56,465 --> 00:18:58,820
It wasn't premeditated.
I'm not Jeffrey Dahmer.

238
00:18:59,065 --> 00:19:03,377
- I don't get off on hacked-up body parts.
- You're having sex?

239
00:19:03,585 --> 00:19:07,418
No. Jesus. No, I'm sorry. I cannot have
this conversation with you.

240
00:19:07,624 --> 00:19:10,138
And I'm sorry, but I don't think
we're ever gonna have...

241
00:19:10,344 --> 00:19:13,813
...a touchy-feely, mother-daughter
relationship like on TV and the movies...

242
00:19:14,023 --> 00:19:16,583
...because you know what?
They don't exist!

243
00:19:24,982 --> 00:19:26,461
Here's our guest...

244
00:19:26,662 --> 00:19:30,291
...and he brought us a bottle
of Louis Jadot Pinot Noir.

245
00:19:31,142 --> 00:19:36,010
- 1997, no less.
- Okay, a man who knows his wine.

246
00:19:36,221 --> 00:19:38,291
I'm liking you more and more, Nate.

247
00:19:38,501 --> 00:19:42,937
Well, I worked at a food co-op in Seattle
for a long time. Learned a little bit.

248
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:45,893
A co-op? So there's a little hippie
in there, huh?

249
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:49,490
That makes sense.
Brenda would find that attractive.

250
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:53,294
She likes to think of herself
as being wildly countercultural.

251
00:19:53,499 --> 00:19:55,854
I think she's actually
just jealous of the fact...

252
00:19:56,059 --> 00:19:59,017
...that Bern and I really were hippies,
briefly.

253
00:19:59,219 --> 00:20:02,654
- Can I offer you a drink?
- Sure, do you have any beer?

254
00:20:02,858 --> 00:20:06,453
No, we have vodka, scotch, bourbon.

255
00:20:06,658 --> 00:20:11,970
- I'll have a little bourbon.
- Manly, but not elitist. Just her type.

256
00:20:12,177 --> 00:20:13,849
Down, girl.

257
00:20:15,497 --> 00:20:18,136
So where is Brenda?

258
00:20:18,337 --> 00:20:21,692
Brenda?
Oh, Brenda's not coming tonight.

259
00:20:26,056 --> 00:20:29,730
- Really?
- She felt, and I have to agree with her...

260
00:20:29,935 --> 00:20:34,167
...we'd have a better chance of getting
to know each other if she weren't here.

261
00:20:34,975 --> 00:20:38,091
She does tend to take
center stage, so to speak.

262
00:20:41,694 --> 00:20:46,972
- I wish somebody had thought to tell me.
- I'm sorry. I assumed she did.

263
00:20:54,933 --> 00:20:56,888
There you are.

264
00:20:57,132 --> 00:20:58,884
David was raised in this church.

265
00:20:59,092 --> 00:21:02,402
He was christened and confirmed here,
he served as an altar boy...

266
00:21:02,612 --> 00:21:06,843
...and he was president
of the youth ministry in high school.

267
00:21:07,051 --> 00:21:10,441
- How old are you, David?
- I'm 31.

268
00:21:10,851 --> 00:21:15,002
- What do you do for a living?
- I'm a funeral director.

269
00:21:15,210 --> 00:21:20,238
His father served as a deacon for over
a decade. He just recently passed away.

270
00:21:20,450 --> 00:21:24,727
So you see this
as a sort of passing the torch.

271
00:21:24,929 --> 00:21:28,842
No, sir, I see it as a chance
to serve God.

272
00:21:29,049 --> 00:21:33,997
Well, I'm glad to hear you say that.
Because that's what it is.

273
00:21:34,208 --> 00:21:39,157
Being a deacon is more than just having
access to the church mailing list...

274
00:21:39,368 --> 00:21:42,882
...and passing out your business cards
after Mass.

275
00:21:43,687 --> 00:21:46,759
Sir, I won't deny that I run a business...

276
00:21:46,967 --> 00:21:49,435
...providing service to people
in times of need.

277
00:21:49,647 --> 00:21:54,083
But I would never exploit my relationship
to the church for marketing purposes.

278
00:21:54,286 --> 00:21:57,756
Frankly, I consider that to be
a pretty grave sin.

279
00:21:58,366 --> 00:22:01,005
No pun intended.

280
00:22:02,205 --> 00:22:05,356
St. Bartholomew is an old church...

281
00:22:05,565 --> 00:22:07,317
...a conservative church...

282
00:22:07,765 --> 00:22:10,040
...a church that doesn't need
to have its boat rocked.

283
00:22:10,245 --> 00:22:12,804
Which is precisely why I feel
David is a good candidate.

284
00:22:13,004 --> 00:22:15,996
How many men his age
have values as strong as his?

285
00:22:16,204 --> 00:22:19,355
I think he would be
an excellent role model.

286
00:22:20,443 --> 00:22:26,075
- Are you married?
- No, sir. I was engaged, briefly.

287
00:22:31,082 --> 00:22:33,960
Is there anything else you'd like
to tell me about yourself...

288
00:22:34,162 --> 00:22:36,039
...before I consider this?

289
00:22:36,242 --> 00:22:38,358
No, sir.

290
00:22:39,761 --> 00:22:43,071
Is there anything specific about me
that you'd like to ask?

291
00:22:43,281 --> 00:22:45,237
No.

292
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:53,519
I'll let you know my decision
in a few days.

293
00:22:57,599 --> 00:22:59,635
- You impressed him.
- You think?

294
00:22:59,839 --> 00:23:01,158
Yes.

295
00:23:01,639 --> 00:23:05,393
Oh, by the way, one of our parishioners
recently lost her father to liver cancer.

296
00:23:05,599 --> 00:23:09,193
Sharon Murdoch. I gave her your name.
You may be getting a call.

297
00:23:09,398 --> 00:23:10,956
Thank you.

298
00:23:15,398 --> 00:23:17,513
- Again with the not knocking.
- Pack some things.

299
00:23:17,717 --> 00:23:19,469
- We're going to San Bernardino.
- What?

300
00:23:19,677 --> 00:23:22,475
We're spending the night
at my cousin Hannah's.

301
00:23:22,677 --> 00:23:26,146
- Mom, I'm doing homework.
- Well, stop!

302
00:23:26,796 --> 00:23:30,186
- I have school tomorrow.
- I'll write a note!

303
00:23:33,916 --> 00:23:36,668
It's been a long time since Brenda's
wanted us to meet...

304
00:23:36,875 --> 00:23:38,228
...any of the men in her life.

305
00:23:38,435 --> 00:23:41,950
- What was that last one, chiropractor?
- He was a Rolfer.

306
00:23:42,155 --> 00:23:43,793
He was an idiot.

307
00:23:43,995 --> 00:23:46,554
Well, I'm not sure Brenda
ever meant for us to meet.

308
00:23:46,754 --> 00:23:49,348
I don't think she expected you guys
to come home that day.

309
00:23:49,594 --> 00:23:50,709
Oh, Nate.

310
00:23:50,914 --> 00:23:54,383
Where Brenda's concerned,
there are no coincidences.

311
00:23:56,633 --> 00:24:00,069
- You think she planned all this?
- Of course.

312
00:24:00,313 --> 00:24:01,792
She's a master manipulator.

313
00:24:02,033 --> 00:24:06,025
I love her dearly, but you really ought
to know what you're getting into.

314
00:24:06,232 --> 00:24:08,143
Would you like another bourbon?

315
00:24:08,432 --> 00:24:10,582
No, thanks.

316
00:24:13,911 --> 00:24:15,185
Can I ask you guys something?

317
00:24:15,431 --> 00:24:18,184
As long as it doesn't involve
asking us for money.

318
00:24:20,631 --> 00:24:22,302
No, it doesn't.

319
00:24:22,510 --> 00:24:26,788
Does the name "Nathaniel"
have any significance to you?

320
00:24:30,590 --> 00:24:34,787
Well, sure. Nathaniel and Isabel.

321
00:24:40,988 --> 00:24:43,343
Brenda adored these books as a little girl.

322
00:24:43,548 --> 00:24:46,824
She could read by the time she was 3.

323
00:24:47,468 --> 00:24:51,540
- What are they about?
- Two orphans who had adventures.

324
00:24:51,747 --> 00:24:53,738
They ran away from an orphanage.

325
00:24:53,947 --> 00:24:56,984
There was a malevolent nurse
who was always hunting them down...

326
00:24:57,227 --> 00:25:00,024
...but they always managed
to outsmart her.

327
00:25:00,466 --> 00:25:03,583
Typical infantile wish fulfillment.

328
00:25:05,546 --> 00:25:08,298
- I've never even heard of them.
- They're British, quite dark.

329
00:25:08,505 --> 00:25:10,621
People die in them all the time.

330
00:25:10,825 --> 00:25:12,304
When Brenda's brother was born...

331
00:25:12,545 --> 00:25:15,742
...we expected serious displacement
anxiety from her, but there was none.

332
00:25:16,105 --> 00:25:19,733
She would sit next to his crib
and read him these stories for hours.

333
00:25:20,264 --> 00:25:24,337
- She was what then, Bern, 4?
- 5 at most.

334
00:25:24,704 --> 00:25:26,820
It's all in the book.

335
00:25:27,783 --> 00:25:29,535
This book?

336
00:25:33,103 --> 00:25:36,731
You mean, she didn't tell
you about that either?

337
00:25:40,542 --> 00:25:42,772
I feel terrible,

338
00:25:42,982 --> 00:25:45,779
- I'm sorry I snapped at Grandma,
- Yeah, huh?

339
00:25:45,981 --> 00:25:49,860
That was a pretty Freaky Friday moment
we had back there,

340
00:25:53,541 --> 00:25:55,496
Ruthie, I am so glad you called.

341
00:25:55,980 --> 00:25:58,813
Ginnie and I would never allow
ourselves this kind of food...

342
00:25:59,020 --> 00:26:01,534
...unless it were a really
special occasion.

343
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:04,930
We are definitely gonna have to do
an extra spinning class this week.

344
00:26:05,139 --> 00:26:06,458
Tomorrow morning?

345
00:26:06,659 --> 00:26:08,570
- Who's teaching?
- Derek.

346
00:26:08,779 --> 00:26:11,088
I'm so there.

347
00:26:12,179 --> 00:26:15,966
Mom and I have the hugest crush
on this spinning instructor at the Y.

348
00:26:16,178 --> 00:26:18,408
He is hot, hot, hot.

349
00:26:20,018 --> 00:26:23,407
So, Claire, have you thought
about college?

350
00:26:24,417 --> 00:26:25,896
Yeah.

351
00:26:26,257 --> 00:26:29,533
I'd love to go to, like,
NYU or Columbia...

352
00:26:29,737 --> 00:26:32,569
...but I don't know
if I could ever get in, so...

353
00:26:32,816 --> 00:26:35,569
Well, there are some great schools
in L.A.

354
00:26:35,776 --> 00:26:39,086
Why would you want to go to school
in the same town you grew up in?

355
00:26:39,296 --> 00:26:42,526
I go to Cal State
right here in San Berdoo.

356
00:26:42,735 --> 00:26:46,125
- Well, whatever rocks your boat.
- Claire.

357
00:26:46,775 --> 00:26:48,447
Hey, I love it.

358
00:26:48,655 --> 00:26:51,930
By living at home, I'm saving
a ton of money for grad school.

359
00:26:52,134 --> 00:26:54,932
I'm not stuck in a crappy dorm
where everyone's smoking pot...

360
00:26:55,174 --> 00:26:57,893
...and playing loud music all the time.

361
00:26:58,734 --> 00:27:02,408
And I don't have to call campus police
every time I walk home from the library...

362
00:27:02,613 --> 00:27:04,888
...so that I don't get raped.

363
00:27:05,133 --> 00:27:09,126
- And I like to stay close to my mom.
- That translates to: I do her laundry.

364
00:27:09,333 --> 00:27:12,051
Oh, that's not true.

365
00:27:12,252 --> 00:27:14,368
I love my mom,
and I'm not ashamed of it.

366
00:27:14,572 --> 00:27:17,325
Thank you, honey. I love you too.

367
00:27:22,091 --> 00:27:24,924
Okay, anybody want more?

368
00:27:34,650 --> 00:27:37,483
- So how was it?
- Oh, it was quite informative.

369
00:27:37,729 --> 00:27:40,527
I know what Nathaniel means now.
I know you have an IQ of 185.

370
00:27:40,729 --> 00:27:42,526
I know you had a book
written about you.

371
00:27:42,729 --> 00:27:45,323
Here, I signed it for you.

372
00:27:47,168 --> 00:27:49,159
Why didn't you just tell me about this?

373
00:27:49,368 --> 00:27:53,361
People always change after they read it.
I was trying to make the fun part last.

374
00:27:53,568 --> 00:27:58,004
Oh, God! So you're kind of
scarily brilliant, I can handle that.

375
00:27:58,207 --> 00:28:00,801
What I can't handle is the way
you keep mind-fucking me...

376
00:28:01,007 --> 00:28:04,283
...for your personal entertainment.
It's really starting to piss me off.

377
00:28:04,487 --> 00:28:07,956
I'm sorry I'm not a well-behaved,
little nothing that never challenges you...

378
00:28:08,166 --> 00:28:12,444
...but if that's what you're looking for,
you might as well just leave right now.

379
00:28:12,646 --> 00:28:14,602
So, what, you're trying
to drive me away?

380
00:28:14,806 --> 00:28:18,115
Yeah, Nate, I'm trying
to drive you away.

381
00:28:23,925 --> 00:28:27,041
It was my mother's idea
that I not be there...

382
00:28:27,244 --> 00:28:31,396
...which is fine by me.
I don't really enjoy their company.

383
00:28:32,044 --> 00:28:34,193
She said it was your idea.

384
00:28:34,403 --> 00:28:38,316
Yeah, she would. She probably
believes that. She's out of her mind.

385
00:28:38,523 --> 00:28:41,401
You could've warned me
what I was walking into.

386
00:28:41,603 --> 00:28:43,433
You wouldn't have gone.

387
00:28:43,642 --> 00:28:48,716
I just wanted to get it all
out of the way.

388
00:28:48,922 --> 00:28:50,514
Them, the book, everything.

389
00:28:50,762 --> 00:28:53,116
Yeah, well, I felt like a fucking lab rat
over there!

390
00:28:53,321 --> 00:28:56,119
Yeah, that's what they do!

391
00:28:57,081 --> 00:29:02,473
I'm 6 years old, I score through the roof
on some standardized, biased test...

392
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:05,194
...and it all becomes about them!

393
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:09,188
They hand me over to strangers,
experts, a bunch of academic fucks...

394
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:13,278
...who scrutinized everything I did
or said or thought even.

395
00:29:13,519 --> 00:29:16,636
It is a fucking law of physics
that the very act of observation...

396
00:29:16,839 --> 00:29:19,911
...changes that which is being observed.

397
00:29:24,598 --> 00:29:29,388
And now you're gonna read that book
and think that you know me.

398
00:29:30,957 --> 00:29:35,189
- Well, you know what? You don't.
- Yeah, because you won't let me.

399
00:29:40,476 --> 00:29:44,594
Okay, fine.
What do you want to know?

400
00:29:47,196 --> 00:29:49,072
Ask me anything.

401
00:29:50,955 --> 00:29:54,106
Did you burn down that house
that we made love in?

402
00:29:55,395 --> 00:29:58,352
You think I burned down the house?

403
00:29:58,554 --> 00:30:01,432
Really? That is so weird!

404
00:30:01,674 --> 00:30:03,232
Well, what am I supposed to think?

405
00:30:03,434 --> 00:30:06,107
You put my brother and me
in the bus that killed our father.

406
00:30:06,314 --> 00:30:09,305
You get weird phone calls from
screaming people you won't explain.

407
00:30:09,513 --> 00:30:11,981
Now you wanna make me
feel stupid for being suspicious?

408
00:30:12,193 --> 00:30:14,627
Give me a fucking reason not to be!

409
00:30:20,672 --> 00:30:23,061
I just want to know what this is...

410
00:30:25,272 --> 00:30:26,989
...for you.

411
00:30:30,071 --> 00:30:33,700
Am I just another step along your way?

412
00:30:36,990 --> 00:30:38,628
Okay, look...

413
00:30:39,870 --> 00:30:42,748
...we obviously have
an intense sexual connection...

414
00:30:42,950 --> 00:30:46,703
...and yes, I would like for there to be
something more than that.

415
00:30:48,549 --> 00:30:53,020
But that can't ever happen until you
trust me, which apparently you don't.

416
00:30:54,148 --> 00:30:56,662
Should I trust you?

417
00:31:02,108 --> 00:31:03,745
Yes.

418
00:31:06,147 --> 00:31:08,103
Come here.

419
00:31:17,826 --> 00:31:21,375
R-A...

420
00:31:21,586 --> 00:31:24,782
...K- E.

421
00:31:29,985 --> 00:31:33,340
Triple letter score for K.
Good one, Mom.

422
00:31:38,824 --> 00:31:41,701
H-E-L-L.

423
00:31:48,703 --> 00:31:53,651
H-E-L-L...

424
00:31:53,862 --> 00:31:55,261
...O.

425
00:31:55,462 --> 00:31:57,532
Hello.

426
00:32:02,941 --> 00:32:04,613
D...

427
00:32:06,461 --> 00:32:07,974
...E...

428
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:10,533
...F...

429
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:13,097
...T.

430
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:16,856
Deft. What is deft?

431
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:20,574
Well, it's a laundry detergent
from when Ruth and I were kids.

432
00:32:20,779 --> 00:32:24,613
No, it's a word.
It means skilled.

433
00:32:25,259 --> 00:32:28,056
Really? Use it in a sentence.

434
00:32:29,218 --> 00:32:32,369
He deftly juggled his responsibilities.

435
00:32:34,018 --> 00:32:35,531
Deft.

436
00:32:38,097 --> 00:32:42,329
Or "Deft, where ith thy sting?"

437
00:32:49,336 --> 00:32:52,373
So how you both doing,
you know, with Nathaniel passing?

438
00:32:52,616 --> 00:32:55,971
- Better every day.
- You know, shit happens.

439
00:32:57,335 --> 00:33:00,486
You know, it's such an awful thing,
losing someone you love.

440
00:33:00,815 --> 00:33:05,092
In terms of stress, it's right up there
with moving and getting fired.

441
00:33:05,294 --> 00:33:08,047
I know when Ed and I split up,
I was devastated.

442
00:33:08,254 --> 00:33:12,293
I didn't even want to get out of bed.
I just wanted to curl up and die.

443
00:33:13,774 --> 00:33:18,767
And all I can say is, thank God
for my precious daughter.

444
00:33:18,973 --> 00:33:22,522
Well, I just wouldn't let her mope.
Just wouldn't let her.

445
00:33:22,773 --> 00:33:25,286
Dragged her ass,
pardon my French, out of bed...

446
00:33:25,492 --> 00:33:27,369
...and took her to spinning class
with me.

447
00:33:27,612 --> 00:33:31,207
And I hated her for it at the time,
but it really got me back on track.

448
00:33:31,412 --> 00:33:34,483
You know, endorphins really are
nature's antidepressants.

449
00:33:34,691 --> 00:33:36,807
Life goes on. It doesn't go on by itself.

450
00:33:37,011 --> 00:33:39,002
Sometimes you just gotta
kick it in the butt.

451
00:33:39,211 --> 00:33:41,645
But Ed didn't die.

452
00:33:41,851 --> 00:33:44,922
He's still alive. You can still see him.

453
00:33:45,130 --> 00:33:48,361
When Ginnie gets married,
you'll both be there.

454
00:33:49,450 --> 00:33:53,283
When she has children,
they'll be able to know him.

455
00:33:56,369 --> 00:33:58,837
He's not gone forever.

456
00:34:00,768 --> 00:34:02,838
Yeah, well, sure, but...

457
00:34:03,248 --> 00:34:07,764
...in terms of the impact
it had on both our lives...

458
00:34:09,967 --> 00:34:11,923
...it's similar.

459
00:34:17,407 --> 00:34:18,999
Okay, I have the greatest idea.

460
00:34:19,207 --> 00:34:23,961
You guys are coming to spinning class
with us tomorrow, bright and early.

461
00:34:24,166 --> 00:34:28,795
No offense, but I'd rather drive
a rusty railroad spike through my skull.

462
00:34:29,645 --> 00:34:31,795
Oh, just try it once.

463
00:34:32,205 --> 00:34:35,083
You might be surprised
how it changes the way you feel.

464
00:34:35,285 --> 00:34:37,594
- I feel fine.
- You know what, Ginnie?

465
00:34:37,805 --> 00:34:41,319
That is absolutely an inspired idea!

466
00:34:42,884 --> 00:34:48,037
Okay, ladies, let's get to bed. Because
if your butt isn't on that bike by 6 a. M...

467
00:34:48,243 --> 00:34:50,279
...Derek doesn't let you in.

468
00:34:55,203 --> 00:34:58,433
So these tits do nothing for you, huh?

469
00:34:58,762 --> 00:35:01,322
Well, I can appreciate
that they are beautiful...

470
00:35:01,522 --> 00:35:04,594
...in their own completely artificial way.

471
00:35:04,802 --> 00:35:08,874
Men loved them.
Well, real men.

472
00:35:10,201 --> 00:35:13,193
You think God cares that you're gay?

473
00:35:15,081 --> 00:35:17,435
You think God cares
that you fucked 30 guys at once?

474
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:20,478
Oh, so you equate being a fag
with being a whore?

475
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:23,194
- No.
- One's okay, but one isn't?

476
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:25,669
I think God appreciates it
when love's involved.

477
00:35:25,919 --> 00:35:27,193
Oh, honey.

478
00:35:27,399 --> 00:35:31,756
I loved every man I ever fucked
while I was fucking him.

479
00:36:13,914 --> 00:36:17,463
- What are you doing?
- Watching you.

480
00:36:22,433 --> 00:36:26,028
Claire, wake up. Get dressed.

481
00:36:26,233 --> 00:36:28,827
- Why?
- We're leaving. Hurry.

482
00:36:29,033 --> 00:36:31,500
Jesus, Mom, I'm starting to feel
like Anne Frank.

483
00:36:31,712 --> 00:36:34,829
If we don't get out of here fast,
we'll have to go spinning.

484
00:36:35,032 --> 00:36:36,750
Oh, my God.

485
00:36:46,871 --> 00:36:48,304
- Let's go.
- Wait.

486
00:36:48,511 --> 00:36:52,583
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

487
00:36:59,749 --> 00:37:01,148
Thanks for buying me breakfast.

488
00:37:01,349 --> 00:37:03,419
Thank you for finding
my G-spot this morning.

489
00:37:03,629 --> 00:37:05,301
Anytime.

490
00:37:07,668 --> 00:37:11,297
Oh, I have something for you.

491
00:37:15,348 --> 00:37:16,497
Wow.

492
00:37:16,708 --> 00:37:20,461
- Oh, come on, it's just a key.
- No, this is great.

493
00:37:21,267 --> 00:37:22,939
I'm a little surprised, that's all.

494
00:37:23,187 --> 00:37:24,256
I'm too nervous to eat.

495
00:37:24,467 --> 00:37:27,856
I'll just drink coffee
until I start twitching and sweating.

496
00:37:28,066 --> 00:37:30,216
Why does being a deacon
mean so much to you now?

497
00:37:30,426 --> 00:37:35,056
- It wasn't a consideration a week ago.
- I know you think it's naive...

498
00:37:35,266 --> 00:37:37,574
...but I see it as a chance
to make a difference...

499
00:37:37,785 --> 00:37:39,662
...make the world a little more tolerant.

500
00:37:39,905 --> 00:37:42,658
David, we have our own church
in West Hollywood...

501
00:37:42,865 --> 00:37:46,174
...which means the other churches
and dioceses don't have to tolerate us.

502
00:37:46,384 --> 00:37:49,103
Frankly, I resent the notion
that I need to be tolerated.

503
00:37:49,344 --> 00:37:52,461
So, what, we should just allow
ourselves to be ghettoized?

504
00:37:52,664 --> 00:37:55,336
Why do you embrace an organization
that doesn't embrace you?

505
00:37:55,583 --> 00:37:59,258
- The church embraces everyone.
- Right. Hate the sin, love the sinner.

506
00:37:59,463 --> 00:38:02,023
- The operative word being "hate. "
- What is with you?

507
00:38:02,223 --> 00:38:04,782
The other night you said
you liked the idea.

508
00:38:07,102 --> 00:38:09,138
I had a chance to think.

509
00:38:14,341 --> 00:38:16,411
Isn't that your brother?

510
00:38:16,621 --> 00:38:18,532
Okay, look, can we just have breakfast...

511
00:38:18,741 --> 00:38:22,858
...without me feeling like I'm George Will
and you're Cokie Roberts with PMS?

512
00:38:23,060 --> 00:38:25,494
You probably like George Will.

513
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:27,053
Dave.

514
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:29,852
- Hi.
- Hey.

515
00:38:31,460 --> 00:38:34,019
Keith, you remember my brother Nate,
don't you?

516
00:38:34,219 --> 00:38:35,937
- How's it going?
- Hey.

517
00:38:36,139 --> 00:38:37,811
This is Brenda.

518
00:38:38,019 --> 00:38:39,930
My...

519
00:38:41,378 --> 00:38:45,417
- My girlfriend.
- I prefer the term "fuck puppet. "

520
00:38:45,658 --> 00:38:49,856
So, what are you guys doing here,
you just play racquetball?

521
00:38:50,977 --> 00:38:55,255
- No. No, we just worked out.
- Oh, so you guys work out together?

522
00:38:59,257 --> 00:39:00,814
Yeah.

523
00:39:01,696 --> 00:39:03,527
Yeah, we do.

524
00:39:04,816 --> 00:39:07,614
Oh, well, that's great.

525
00:39:10,055 --> 00:39:12,091
Okay, great.

526
00:39:12,295 --> 00:39:14,650
Okay, you guys have a great day.

527
00:39:14,855 --> 00:39:16,334
You too.

528
00:39:18,294 --> 00:39:20,285
Bye, David.

529
00:39:24,974 --> 00:39:26,965
Oh, my God, I think David is gay.

530
00:39:27,174 --> 00:39:30,722
I think David is lucky.
Did you get a look at that guy?

531
00:39:39,572 --> 00:39:41,403
Claire.

532
00:39:43,292 --> 00:39:45,487
I had an affair.

533
00:39:49,251 --> 00:39:52,288
For the last two years
I was seeing someone.

534
00:39:54,091 --> 00:39:58,242
Your father never knew about it.
At least, I hope he didn't.

535
00:39:59,530 --> 00:40:01,805
And I called it off after he died.

536
00:40:03,810 --> 00:40:06,448
It's not something I'm proud of.

537
00:40:07,809 --> 00:40:10,881
- Why are you telling me this?
- Because it's the truth.

538
00:40:11,809 --> 00:40:16,245
And whatever relationship
you and I have, I want it to be honest...

539
00:40:16,448 --> 00:40:18,279
...even if you hate me.

540
00:40:19,248 --> 00:40:21,603
Mom, I don't hate you.

541
00:40:24,847 --> 00:40:27,236
I remember going to the movies
on Monday nights...

542
00:40:27,487 --> 00:40:31,639
...but I'm 17 years old now,
and I have my own life.

543
00:40:32,367 --> 00:40:35,517
And there's things I have
to figure out on my own.

544
00:40:36,566 --> 00:40:38,955
And that's, like, normal.

545
00:40:42,645 --> 00:40:45,205
And I know stealing a foot is weird...

546
00:40:45,405 --> 00:40:49,557
...but hello, living in a house where
a foot is available to be stolen is weird.

547
00:40:54,764 --> 00:40:56,994
I gotta get to school.

548
00:41:20,761 --> 00:41:23,229
- Did you see his face?
- Oh, man.

549
00:41:23,441 --> 00:41:26,114
I know I shouldn't be laughing,
but he looked so stupefied.

550
00:41:26,321 --> 00:41:29,790
The way he was all,
"Great, great. I'm hip, I'm cool. "

551
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,479
Proud of you, man.

552
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:33,910
So listen, this thing in Laguna
is Saturday night.

553
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:36,759
I got us a room at the Surf and Sand.
You ever been there?

554
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:39,154
- No.
- Man, it's gonna be great.

555
00:41:39,359 --> 00:41:41,156
We got a fireplace
overlooking the ocean.

556
00:41:41,359 --> 00:41:44,396
Keith, I don't think I can make it after all.

557
00:41:45,799 --> 00:41:49,916
I shouldn't miss church, not while
they're considering me for a deaconship.

558
00:41:50,118 --> 00:41:52,871
- I'm sorry.
- Fine.

559
00:41:55,318 --> 00:41:56,956
We'll come back Saturday night.

560
00:41:57,157 --> 00:41:59,830
- That'll work.
- I can go to church with you on Sunday.

561
00:42:00,757 --> 00:42:02,236
That's not a good idea.

562
00:42:02,437 --> 00:42:04,997
This hasn't been a good idea
from the beginning, has it?

563
00:42:05,237 --> 00:42:06,828
Fine, why don't we cut our losses...

564
00:42:07,036 --> 00:42:08,913
...and call it quits right now?
- What?

565
00:42:09,116 --> 00:42:12,472
Look, as long as you feel the need
to keep our relationship a secret...

566
00:42:12,676 --> 00:42:16,463
David, you're ashamed of it!
I'm not having any of that, not anymore.

567
00:42:16,715 --> 00:42:18,945
- I just came out to my brother.
- One step forward.

568
00:42:19,155 --> 00:42:22,431
Now you want to take a giant leap
backwards into the arms of the enemy.

569
00:42:22,635 --> 00:42:24,512
So now I'm a Nazi collaborator?

570
00:42:24,715 --> 00:42:27,592
A lot of African-Americans might say
the same thing about you...

571
00:42:27,794 --> 00:42:30,103
...being a member of the L.A.P.D.

572
00:42:31,394 --> 00:42:33,385
You fucking coward!

573
00:42:35,033 --> 00:42:36,785
Keith, please don't...

574
00:43:01,071 --> 00:43:02,867
It works.

575
00:43:03,070 --> 00:43:05,345
I must have left the stereo on again.

576
00:43:06,150 --> 00:43:10,109
So you are not too freaked out?

577
00:43:10,510 --> 00:43:12,261
A little, maybe.

578
00:43:13,349 --> 00:43:14,782
It makes David more interesting.

579
00:43:15,029 --> 00:43:18,704
No, I mean about me giving you
a key to my apartment.

580
00:43:19,949 --> 00:43:23,384
What do you think I am, an aging
Peter Pan who's gonna disappear...

581
00:43:23,628 --> 00:43:26,347
...at the sign of something permanent?
- Well, yeah.

582
00:43:26,788 --> 00:43:30,860
You're one to talk. You couldn't even
allow me to refer to you as my girlfriend.

583
00:43:34,507 --> 00:43:36,338
Don't mind me.

584
00:43:39,387 --> 00:43:43,174
I thought we agreed that you would call
before you came over.

585
00:43:43,386 --> 00:43:47,618
I did. The hot water's out in my building.
I needed to take a shower.

586
00:43:47,866 --> 00:43:49,981
Don't be mad at me.

587
00:43:50,185 --> 00:43:52,335
You know I hate it
when you're mad at me.

588
00:43:52,545 --> 00:43:56,333
Hey, it's me,
I need to use your shower, okay?

589
00:43:56,545 --> 00:43:59,900
Besides, I haven't seen you in a while,
and it's a fucking gorgeous day,

590
00:44:00,464 --> 00:44:03,934
- Satisfied?
- I'm going to make a cup of tea.

591
00:44:04,264 --> 00:44:05,697
Hey...

592
00:44:05,904 --> 00:44:10,021
...I'll take one of those.
- Hey, you behave yourself.

593
00:44:13,023 --> 00:44:15,981
Hi. What's your name?

594
00:44:17,063 --> 00:44:20,532
- Nate.
- Nice to meet you. I'm Billy.

595
00:44:22,982 --> 00:44:24,381
Hi.

596
00:44:25,302 --> 00:44:27,576
So how long you known Brenda?

597
00:44:28,461 --> 00:44:30,850
A few months.

598
00:44:33,821 --> 00:44:35,573
So...

599
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:40,452
Who am I and why am I in your
girlfriend's house practically naked?

600
00:44:41,140 --> 00:44:44,689
- Yeah.
- She's my sister.

601
00:44:45,100 --> 00:44:47,659
She's my mother. Sister. My mother.

602
00:44:50,539 --> 00:44:54,088
Sorry. Nobody's ever laughed at that.
I should know better.

603
00:44:54,299 --> 00:44:56,368
It's nice to meet you.

604
00:44:56,858 --> 00:44:59,418
- So you met the parents yet?
- Yes, last night.

605
00:44:59,618 --> 00:45:00,937
Wow.

606
00:45:01,538 --> 00:45:03,813
You've made it pretty far.

607
00:45:05,377 --> 00:45:07,652
So why haven't I heard about you?

608
00:45:09,697 --> 00:45:11,767
No idea.

609
00:45:14,736 --> 00:45:18,524
Well, I guess I better go
put some clothes on.

610
00:45:43,573 --> 00:45:47,964
How'd you get her breasts synchronized?
Some sort of industrial epoxy?

611
00:45:51,372 --> 00:45:53,806
Would you ask Colonel Sanders
for his secret recipe?

612
00:45:54,012 --> 00:45:56,845
Oh, come on, I'm not gonna tell.

613
00:46:00,931 --> 00:46:04,526
I stuck a can of cat food
under each one.

614
00:46:05,371 --> 00:46:08,249
My sister-in-law did
a cat food commercial.

615
00:46:08,451 --> 00:46:10,566
We've got like 10 cases.

616
00:46:12,890 --> 00:46:16,360
Hey. I'm Larry Wadd.

617
00:46:18,530 --> 00:46:20,485
You know...

618
00:46:20,689 --> 00:46:25,205
...I met Viveca St. John
before she even did her first video.

619
00:46:26,049 --> 00:46:28,403
Yeah, she was...

620
00:46:28,608 --> 00:46:33,966
She was the fluffer
on the set of Dirty Larry 3.

621
00:46:34,168 --> 00:46:36,363
She was...

622
00:46:37,248 --> 00:46:40,159
...friendly. She was eager.

623
00:46:41,887 --> 00:46:45,596
I can honestly say I've never received
a better blowjob in my life.

624
00:46:45,807 --> 00:46:48,081
And nobody was even filming it.

625
00:46:52,006 --> 00:46:56,521
When I first met Viveca,
I met her on Deep Diving.

626
00:46:57,325 --> 00:46:59,122
Thank you.

627
00:46:59,365 --> 00:47:04,200
And I had never gone down on a girl
before. So naturally, I was nervous...

628
00:47:04,405 --> 00:47:07,237
...but Viveca was so warm
and relaxed about it.

629
00:47:07,444 --> 00:47:10,322
She really put me at ease.

630
00:47:11,044 --> 00:47:14,956
Well, her and the two Xanax
she gave me.

631
00:47:15,323 --> 00:47:17,837
And when I first had to do
a double penetration...

632
00:47:18,083 --> 00:47:20,313
...I was, like, a total wreck.

633
00:47:20,523 --> 00:47:26,757
But Viveca came through
like such the pro she is.

634
00:47:27,482 --> 00:47:29,200
I mean was.

635
00:47:36,881 --> 00:47:40,430
- Nate, what the hell is going on in there?
- A funeral.

636
00:47:40,681 --> 00:47:43,797
For whom? A prostitute?

637
00:47:45,600 --> 00:47:50,674
A woman who was a star
of adult videos.

638
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:53,475
Mom, we're gonna clear
8 grand from this.

639
00:47:53,679 --> 00:47:56,512
We can finally pay for all that
air conditioning work.

640
00:48:00,199 --> 00:48:03,315
I'm just glad your sister is at school.

641
00:48:03,558 --> 00:48:07,392
It was awful.
They're like best friends.

642
00:48:08,278 --> 00:48:11,713
They're both like cheerleaders
with this totally plastic way of life...

643
00:48:11,917 --> 00:48:14,636
...like spinning class solves everything...

644
00:48:15,237 --> 00:48:18,149
...and they're both hot
for the same guy. It was creepy.

645
00:48:26,676 --> 00:48:28,075
My mom's...

646
00:48:29,515 --> 00:48:32,234
My mom is just so fucking sad.

647
00:48:34,195 --> 00:48:36,550
And I wish I could help her.

648
00:48:39,594 --> 00:48:41,710
So help her.

649
00:48:43,354 --> 00:48:47,313
Now, Mrs. Murdoch, some people
prefer the solemnity of a church...

650
00:48:47,514 --> 00:48:50,073
...and St. Bartholomew
is a beautiful setting.

651
00:48:50,273 --> 00:48:54,186
Here, however, one is more free
to customize the service.

652
00:48:54,393 --> 00:48:58,431
I'm sorry to interrupt.
I just had to tell somebody.

653
00:48:59,272 --> 00:49:05,347
Viveca looks so great.
Her tits have never looked better.

654
00:49:07,151 --> 00:49:09,665
She was like a sister to me.

655
00:49:18,510 --> 00:49:20,978
I'm so glad that you're pleased.

656
00:49:21,190 --> 00:49:24,660
We want to remember her
at her very best, don't we?

657
00:49:24,870 --> 00:49:28,942
Now, I'm sorry, but I'm helping
some other people right now.

658
00:49:29,149 --> 00:49:32,061
- Okay.
- I'll talk to you after the service?

659
00:49:32,269 --> 00:49:34,066
Okay.

660
00:49:39,548 --> 00:49:42,506
I think we'll have Dad's service
at the church.

661
00:49:42,708 --> 00:49:43,663
Fine.

662
00:49:43,868 --> 00:49:48,577
I'm not a religious man,
but I do believe in God.

663
00:49:50,067 --> 00:49:55,743
If I were to make a list of the things
I thank God for the most...

664
00:49:56,746 --> 00:50:00,341
...fucking Viv would be
at the top of that list.

665
00:50:00,546 --> 00:50:03,582
She was a goddamn force of nature.

666
00:50:03,785 --> 00:50:08,142
And I loved her.
And I know God loved her too.

667
00:50:08,385 --> 00:50:12,014
I know he knew
just what he was doing...

668
00:50:12,664 --> 00:50:14,973
...and how much joy...

669
00:50:15,184 --> 00:50:18,256
...she would bring to the world.

670
00:50:29,863 --> 00:50:33,457
For David James Fisher,
chosen deacon in your church...

671
00:50:33,662 --> 00:50:37,098
...we pray to you, O Lord.
- Lord, hear our prayer.

672
00:50:37,302 --> 00:50:40,452
That he may faithfully fulfill
the duties of this ministry...

673
00:50:40,661 --> 00:50:43,300
...build up your church
and glorify your name...

674
00:50:43,501 --> 00:50:47,016
...we pray to you, O Lord.
- Lord, hear our prayer.

675
00:50:47,261 --> 00:50:51,253
That by the indwelling of the Holy Spirit
he may be sustained and encouraged...

676
00:50:51,460 --> 00:50:52,779
...to persevere to the end...

677
00:50:53,060 --> 00:50:56,769
...we pray to you, O Lord.
- Lord, hear our prayer.

678
00:50:57,020 --> 00:51:00,568
For all who fear God
and believe in you, Lord Christ...

679
00:51:00,779 --> 00:51:04,328
...that our divisions may cease
and that all may be as one...

680
00:51:04,579 --> 00:51:07,298
...as you and the Father are one.

681
00:51:07,499 --> 00:51:11,730
- We pray to you, O Lord.
- Lord, hear our prayer.

682
00:51:25,937 --> 00:51:28,450
Way to go, Dave.

683
00:51:28,656 --> 00:51:30,647
All I have to do is join the Kiwanis club...

684
00:51:30,856 --> 00:51:34,087
...and Fisher & Sons will have
all our bases covered.

685
00:51:34,776 --> 00:51:36,766
Where's Keith?

686
00:51:36,975 --> 00:51:39,694
He's just a friend, Nate.

687
00:51:44,055 --> 00:51:46,329
- Very good to see you.
- Hello.

688
00:51:51,214 --> 00:51:53,569
So, Mom, what are you doing
tomorrow night?

689
00:51:53,774 --> 00:51:56,970
Nothing as far as I know. Why?

690
00:51:57,173 --> 00:52:01,849
I thought maybe you'd want to go see
a movie or rent a movie or something.

691
00:52:02,573 --> 00:52:05,803
Okay, but if you cry,
the whole thing is off.

692
00:52:08,932 --> 00:52:10,285
Thanks for coming today.

693
00:52:10,492 --> 00:52:13,722
- I know you must've found this a little...
- Are you kidding? I loved it.

694
00:52:13,931 --> 00:52:17,321
All that pageantry, it's so trippy.
It's like a Fellini movie.

695
00:52:17,531 --> 00:52:22,082
Well, it was kind of cool being with you
here in front of God and everybody.

696
00:52:25,490 --> 00:52:29,847
- You don't really believe in God, do you?
- Well, yeah.

697
00:52:30,690 --> 00:52:34,284
I mean, I don't believe in some bearded,
old, white man up in a cloud...

698
00:52:34,489 --> 00:52:36,161
...but I believe in something.

699
00:52:36,369 --> 00:52:39,566
Some sort of undefinable creative force.

700
00:52:39,769 --> 00:52:42,760
I think it's just all totally random.

701
00:52:42,968 --> 00:52:44,287
Really?

702
00:52:44,728 --> 00:52:46,047
Yeah.

703
00:52:46,488 --> 00:52:50,879
We live, we die.
Ultimately, nothing means anything.

704
00:52:51,087 --> 00:52:52,839
How can you live like that?

705
00:52:53,047 --> 00:52:55,402
I don't know. Sometimes
I wake up so fucking empty...

706
00:52:55,607 --> 00:53:00,316
...I wish I'd never been born,
but what choice do I have?

707
00:53:04,940 --> 00:53:12,895
