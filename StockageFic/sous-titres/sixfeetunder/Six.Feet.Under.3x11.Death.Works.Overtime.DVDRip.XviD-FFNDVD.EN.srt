1
00:01:46,231 --> 00:01:48,699
- Come on!
- OK, OK.

2
00:01:48,751 --> 00:01:52,107
- Everything out of the tray too, bitch.
- That's all of it.

3
00:01:52,151 --> 00:01:55,587
- This it?
- That's all I have. Now you take it.

4
00:01:55,631 --> 00:01:59,749
- Fuck!
- Get the fuck out before I call the police!

5
00:02:19,031 --> 00:02:22,819
Barb, it's Nate again. Did I wake you up?

6
00:02:22,871 --> 00:02:25,624
- Are you kidding?
- Have you heard anything?

7
00:02:25,671 --> 00:02:28,231
- Is she there?
- No. Did you call the police?

8
00:02:28,271 --> 00:02:32,264
Yeah. They filed a missing persons report.

9
00:02:32,311 --> 00:02:34,506
Good.

10
00:02:34,551 --> 00:02:37,463
I didn't know they could do that
if it was under 24 hours.

11
00:02:37,511 --> 00:02:39,502
I did the same thing up here.

12
00:02:39,551 --> 00:02:44,830
They said not to bother calling the highway
patrol cos everyone has it statewide.

13
00:02:44,871 --> 00:02:49,865
- But I say fuck it, let's just keep calling.
- Has she ever just taken off before?

14
00:02:49,911 --> 00:02:53,620
No. She'd go off for a day or two
where nobody knew where she was,

15
00:02:53,671 --> 00:02:57,027
just to clear out the cobwebs,
but not since she had the baby.

16
00:02:57,071 --> 00:03:00,381
- Yeah, her vision quests. I know.
- Right.

17
00:03:00,431 --> 00:03:04,663
She used to do that in Seattle,
but she'd always tell somebody about it.

18
00:03:04,711 --> 00:03:10,149
If you're wondering whether I think she might
have left you, I truly, seriously doubt it.

19
00:03:10,191 --> 00:03:12,910
- Not without Maya.
- You think she might have left me?

20
00:03:12,951 --> 00:03:17,422
No, I don't. We'll just keep checking
with the police and the highway patrol.

21
00:03:17,471 --> 00:03:19,826
- She'll turn up.
- Yeah.

22
00:03:19,871 --> 00:03:22,544
Yeah, she'll turn up.

23
00:04:13,111 --> 00:04:15,102
- Hello.
- David?

24
00:04:16,111 --> 00:04:18,102
- Yeah.
- Did you feel that?

25
00:04:18,151 --> 00:04:20,506
- Feel what?
- Earthquake.

26
00:04:21,591 --> 00:04:26,142
- No, I guess I missed it.
- Sorry, I forgot. You're in San Diego.

27
00:04:26,191 --> 00:04:30,423
Actually, I'm not. I came back early.
What's going on?

28
00:04:31,511 --> 00:04:33,945
Lisa still hasn't shown up at her sister's.

29
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:39,067
- No one's heard from her?
- No.

30
00:04:39,111 --> 00:04:42,421
She hasn't called you?
Have you tried her cellphone?

31
00:04:42,471 --> 00:04:45,349
Yeah, like 30 fucking times.

32
00:04:49,271 --> 00:04:52,263
I'm really starting to freak out here.

33
00:04:52,311 --> 00:04:56,907
I'll be right over.
Give me half an hour. I'm on my way.

34
00:05:44,631 --> 00:05:47,350
- I'm sure she's fine.
- Yeah?

35
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:51,066
Then why hasn't she answered any one
of the 40 messages I've left for her?

36
00:05:51,111 --> 00:05:55,104
Maybe the battery on her cellphone
ran out of whatever they run out of.

37
00:05:55,151 --> 00:05:59,429
It's been almost 18 hours
since I spoke to her last.

38
00:05:59,471 --> 00:06:02,827
You said yourself she does
this kind of thing from time to time.

39
00:06:02,871 --> 00:06:05,066
She would have told me about it.

40
00:06:05,111 --> 00:06:08,786
Lisa strikes me as very capable
of taking care of herself.

41
00:06:08,831 --> 00:06:10,822
Morning.

42
00:06:13,311 --> 00:06:15,700
Anyone else feel that earthquake?

43
00:06:16,711 --> 00:06:20,465
- I did.
- Why all the doom and gloom?

44
00:06:20,511 --> 00:06:22,786
- Lisa is missing.
- She's not missing.

45
00:06:22,831 --> 00:06:26,062
We just don't quite know where she is.

46
00:06:26,111 --> 00:06:27,669
Holy shit.

47
00:06:30,031 --> 00:06:32,022
Hello?

48
00:06:32,751 --> 00:06:36,061
Yes, this is the Fisher and Diaz funeral home.

49
00:06:36,111 --> 00:06:40,104
Of course. We could take care
of all your arrangements for you.

50
00:06:40,151 --> 00:06:42,142
Yeah.

51
00:06:42,191 --> 00:06:45,183
All right, we'll see you then. Goodbye.

52
00:06:45,231 --> 00:06:49,349
- Got a family coming in at 10:30.
- We already have two intakes today.

53
00:06:49,391 --> 00:06:51,382
Great.

54
00:06:51,431 --> 00:06:56,300
If this is too much for you, I can get Rico
to come in early and Arthur can help.

55
00:06:56,351 --> 00:07:02,187
Thanks. I just... think trying to work will be
better than waiting for the phone to ring.

56
00:07:02,231 --> 00:07:06,224
You do whatever it is you need to do.
I'll take Maya for the day.

57
00:07:10,111 --> 00:07:12,102
Thank you.

58
00:07:18,151 --> 00:07:20,142
I'd better get dressed.

59
00:07:29,471 --> 00:07:32,508
- Hello.
- Where are you?

60
00:07:32,551 --> 00:07:34,667
In a doctor's office waiting for Vanessa.

61
00:07:34,711 --> 00:07:37,464
We have three intakes this morning.
I need you here.

62
00:07:37,511 --> 00:07:40,901
I've got both kids. I'll be there
as soon as Vanessa's done.

63
00:07:40,951 --> 00:07:42,987
All right, fine.

64
00:07:43,031 --> 00:07:46,023
Don't be giving me attitude. Vanessa is sick.

65
00:07:46,071 --> 00:07:49,143
I'm sorry. Just get here as soon as you can.

66
00:07:55,071 --> 00:07:59,508
You don't have to be here,
I mean, if your job is more important.

67
00:07:59,551 --> 00:08:03,703
- Yes, I do. She's my wife.
- And she's my sister.

68
00:08:03,751 --> 00:08:06,948
I can take care of her too.

69
00:08:06,991 --> 00:08:10,506
Maybe she needs a little time away from you.
Did you ever think of that?

70
00:08:10,551 --> 00:08:15,625
- Is Mommy sick?
- No, Mommy's not sick. Mommy's just fine.

71
00:08:19,471 --> 00:08:23,908
5mg of Ativan to take the edge
off the 40 mils of Celexa.

72
00:08:23,951 --> 00:08:27,341
20 mils of trazodone to help me sleep at night.

73
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:30,622
And sometimes I take
a little Ambien too. 5 mils.

74
00:08:30,671 --> 00:08:33,060
Buspar, 10 mils a day.

75
00:08:33,111 --> 00:08:36,786
300mg of Wellbutrin to help me
with all the compulsive eating.

76
00:08:36,831 --> 00:08:39,186
I have been putting on a shitload of weight.

77
00:08:39,231 --> 00:08:42,189
Who prescribed all this medication?

78
00:08:42,231 --> 00:08:45,268
My doctor. Well, not all of it.

79
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:48,701
The trazodone, the Ativan and the Ambien,
I got on my own.

80
00:08:48,751 --> 00:08:51,902
But it's my friend. She's an RN
and she knows about this stuff.

81
00:08:51,951 --> 00:08:54,340
Your doctor is your psychiatrist?

82
00:08:54,391 --> 00:08:56,951
He's an internist.

83
00:08:56,991 --> 00:08:58,788
I see.

84
00:08:58,831 --> 00:09:04,064
Well, first of all, we need to get you off
a lot of this medication.

85
00:09:04,111 --> 00:09:06,784
Some of what you're taking
could be counteracting

86
00:09:06,831 --> 00:09:10,107
or even aggravating your symptoms.

87
00:09:12,031 --> 00:09:14,022
Shit.

88
00:09:15,791 --> 00:09:21,821
I feel like I'm in a hole and I just feel like
the hole keeps getting deeper and deeper.

89
00:09:21,871 --> 00:09:25,989
I'm not surprised,
but we're going to try to fix that.

90
00:09:28,431 --> 00:09:32,060
Antidepressants aren't magic bullets.

91
00:09:42,151 --> 00:09:44,142
Nate.

92
00:09:45,271 --> 00:09:48,502
David told me about Lisa.

93
00:09:51,911 --> 00:09:55,904
Please make yourself comfortable.
I'll be right with you.

94
00:09:59,071 --> 00:10:00,584
Yes, and?

95
00:10:00,631 --> 00:10:03,703
According to statistics
compiled by the US Census Bureau,

96
00:10:03,751 --> 00:10:08,142
women are three times less likely to die
from misadventure as men.

97
00:10:09,871 --> 00:10:14,899
I find statistics to be comforting
in times of stress and uncertainty.

98
00:10:14,951 --> 00:10:17,067
I've got an intake right now.

99
00:10:17,111 --> 00:10:20,069
I was wondering, may I join you?

100
00:10:20,111 --> 00:10:24,901
You know me, I'm always hungry
for new learning experiences.

101
00:10:24,951 --> 00:10:27,146
Sure, why not?

102
00:10:31,871 --> 00:10:35,944
We have been robbed before.
Three times in ten years.

103
00:10:36,831 --> 00:10:42,542
Dorothy wanted for us to retire,
but I just kept putting it off.

104
00:10:42,591 --> 00:10:46,027
Maybe next year, maybe the year after that.

105
00:10:46,071 --> 00:10:49,427
And now she's taken away from me.

106
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:52,031
How can she not be here?

107
00:10:52,071 --> 00:10:58,101
One minute she's there, the next she's gone,
like she was never there.

108
00:10:59,791 --> 00:11:01,782
At least she's no longer suffering.

109
00:11:07,151 --> 00:11:11,508
- She had cancer, right?
- No! She was shot in a hold-up!

110
00:11:12,671 --> 00:11:14,662
I am so sorry.

111
00:11:22,071 --> 00:11:25,143
What kind of interment were you interested in?

112
00:11:25,191 --> 00:11:27,546
We have a plot at Forest Lawn.

113
00:11:29,351 --> 00:11:31,819
I see.

114
00:11:31,871 --> 00:11:34,783
Would you like to look at our line of caskets?

115
00:11:34,831 --> 00:11:38,426
I don't have much money.

116
00:11:38,471 --> 00:11:43,420
I'm sure we can find something
to accommodate your budget.

117
00:11:44,431 --> 00:11:46,865
Right? Nate?

118
00:11:49,111 --> 00:11:52,421
- Absolutely.
- Thank you.

119
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:56,110
Absolutely.

120
00:11:56,151 --> 00:12:00,349
He was electrocuted. I don't want
my children to see him like that.

121
00:12:00,391 --> 00:12:03,906
- We have an excellent restorative artist.
- No.

122
00:12:03,951 --> 00:12:07,023
I don't want my children to see him dead.

123
00:12:08,311 --> 00:12:11,906
- If you'll excuse me for just a moment.
- Sure.

124
00:12:22,031 --> 00:12:27,230
- What do you mean, missing?
- She was on her way to her sister's.

125
00:12:27,271 --> 00:12:30,581
- She never got there.
- Oh, man.

126
00:12:33,031 --> 00:12:36,865
I still have a couple of contacts
with the sheriffs department.

127
00:12:36,911 --> 00:12:39,869
Do you want me to make some calls?

128
00:12:39,911 --> 00:12:44,143
Nate's already talked to them.
They filed a missing persons report.

129
00:12:44,191 --> 00:12:47,342
If you think you can find anything else out,
sure, why not?

130
00:12:50,431 --> 00:12:53,662
We need to talk. About us.

131
00:12:53,711 --> 00:12:56,100
I know and we will, but not right now.

132
00:12:56,991 --> 00:12:59,585
I have a woman waiting for me
in the pastoral room.

133
00:13:02,551 --> 00:13:04,746
OK.

134
00:13:04,791 --> 00:13:08,340
I'll make some calls.
I'll get back to you if I hear anything.

135
00:13:08,391 --> 00:13:10,382
Thanks.

136
00:13:19,191 --> 00:13:22,627
- This is so Day Of The Locust.
- No locusts here.

137
00:13:22,671 --> 00:13:25,265
Cockroaches maybe, but no locusts.

138
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:28,902
Here we are.

139
00:13:35,071 --> 00:13:37,426
Now, that there is a sleeper sofa.

140
00:13:37,471 --> 00:13:41,100
They come in very handy
when you have overnight guests.

141
00:13:41,151 --> 00:13:44,348
Like family, that sort of thing.

142
00:13:44,391 --> 00:13:46,905
You do have family, don't you?

143
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:51,229
No, actually. They were all killed in a flood.

144
00:13:51,271 --> 00:13:54,900
- Honey, I'm sorry.
- Don't be.

145
00:13:54,951 --> 00:14:00,264
I'll be honest with you. We do have
the occasional break-in every once in a while.

146
00:14:00,311 --> 00:14:04,099
If I were you, I would sleep with a can
of pepper spray under my pillow.

147
00:14:04,151 --> 00:14:06,346
Just in case.

148
00:14:06,391 --> 00:14:10,304
- Smells like cats.
- We don't allow pets.

149
00:14:10,351 --> 00:14:14,026
- We used to, but not any more.
- How much?

150
00:14:14,071 --> 00:14:19,748
175 per week, payable every Monday
and two weeks' security deposit.

151
00:14:22,511 --> 00:14:24,900
I'll take it.

152
00:14:30,431 --> 00:14:34,470
- What are you doing here?
- I made this for you.

153
00:14:37,831 --> 00:14:40,629
Russell...

154
00:14:40,671 --> 00:14:43,310
Claire, I just want you to know

155
00:14:43,351 --> 00:14:47,583
that what happened between
Olivier and me was totally fucked up.

156
00:14:49,191 --> 00:14:53,548
What happened between you and me
wasn't fucked up at all.

157
00:14:53,591 --> 00:14:56,344
It was the opposite of fucked up.

158
00:14:57,391 --> 00:15:00,781
- What did happen between you and Olivier?
- It doesn't matter.

159
00:15:00,831 --> 00:15:04,949
- It matters to me. Did you fuck him?
- What we did or didn't do isn't important.

160
00:15:04,991 --> 00:15:08,063
What's important is that I love you.

161
00:15:09,551 --> 00:15:13,146
- Did he fuck you?
- I was drunk and stoned.

162
00:15:13,191 --> 00:15:18,345
And he was playing this head trip on me.
You know what he's like.

163
00:15:18,391 --> 00:15:21,110
Did you give each other blow jobs?

164
00:15:21,151 --> 00:15:25,463
- Claire, I love you.
- Jesus, you gave each other blow jobs?

165
00:15:25,511 --> 00:15:27,900
- I didn't say that.
- Jerk each other off?

166
00:15:27,951 --> 00:15:30,101
- I didn't say that.
- What are you saying?

167
00:15:30,151 --> 00:15:33,063
That I love you, OK?

168
00:15:33,111 --> 00:15:36,069
Why can't you hear that?

169
00:15:36,111 --> 00:15:39,865
When are you gonna get over
your wounded pride for one second

170
00:15:39,911 --> 00:15:42,983
and realise what we have is too good
for you to throw away?

171
00:15:43,031 --> 00:15:47,070
For me to throw away?
That's funny. You're funny.

172
00:15:47,111 --> 00:15:49,750
And that's hideous. I don't want it.

173
00:15:49,791 --> 00:15:54,706
Maybe you can sell it to your fucking boyfriend
for another $500. I'm sure you were worth it.

174
00:15:54,751 --> 00:15:57,868
- I don't wanna live without you.
- You're gonna have to.

175
00:15:57,911 --> 00:16:01,620
- I'm not gonna give up.
- That's your fucking problem.

176
00:16:26,471 --> 00:16:29,508
- Hello.
- Hello, Brenda.

177
00:16:29,551 --> 00:16:33,669
- Hi, Mom.
- I heard you freaked out on Billy.

178
00:16:33,711 --> 00:16:36,669
You really shouldn't do that.
He's on medication.

179
00:16:36,711 --> 00:16:38,702
You know how sensitive he is.

180
00:16:38,751 --> 00:16:43,347
Is there any other reason you called?
If this is it, I'm hanging up.

181
00:16:45,231 --> 00:16:48,826
Well, we're disposing
of your father's ashes tomorrow.

182
00:16:48,871 --> 00:16:52,386
I thought you might wanna be there.

183
00:16:52,431 --> 00:16:56,185
I really don't wanna be round Billy right now.

184
00:16:58,951 --> 00:17:02,227
Darling, we owe it to your father.

185
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:04,182
Dad's dead. He doesn't care.

186
00:17:04,231 --> 00:17:09,021
Well, I care, OK? I'd like to at least
pretend that we all love each other

187
00:17:09,071 --> 00:17:12,700
and that your father and I
created something worthwhile.

188
00:17:12,751 --> 00:17:15,823
For a fucking hour,
however long it takes to dump his ashes.

189
00:17:15,871 --> 00:17:18,624
Is that too much to ask?

190
00:17:20,391 --> 00:17:23,747
- Have you decided where?
- No, not yet.

191
00:17:23,791 --> 00:17:28,228
We're all meeting here around 11.30.
The whole ordeal'll be done by two.

192
00:17:29,311 --> 00:17:32,383
- Fine. I'll be there.
- OK, bye.

193
00:17:58,151 --> 00:18:02,349
Give yourself the grade you think you deserve.

194
00:18:02,391 --> 00:18:04,427
Is that paying me to keep my mouth shut?

195
00:18:04,471 --> 00:18:07,781
I'm letting every student
give their own grade.

196
00:18:07,831 --> 00:18:12,302
- Who am I to judge anyone's work?
- Oh, God, you're ridiculous.

197
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:15,502
You contradict yourself
so nothing ever means anything.

198
00:18:15,551 --> 00:18:18,349
Is meaning what you're really after?

199
00:18:18,391 --> 00:18:21,224
Your work this semester
would suggest otherwise.

200
00:18:21,871 --> 00:18:25,864
Your technique is excellent,
but that's all it is-technique.

201
00:18:25,911 --> 00:18:29,301
Your work is safe, limited.

202
00:18:29,351 --> 00:18:32,229
Cos you hold yourself back from life.

203
00:18:33,111 --> 00:18:36,581
Well, call me crazy, but I think
an artist has a responsibility

204
00:18:36,631 --> 00:18:39,464
to do more than just give in
to every emotional impulse.

205
00:18:39,511 --> 00:18:42,071
Because some impulses are wrong.

206
00:18:42,871 --> 00:18:47,706
And some impulses violate
the regulations of this school. I checked.

207
00:18:47,751 --> 00:18:51,539
Exactly how many schools have you taught at?

208
00:18:51,591 --> 00:18:56,665
You sit in such judgement of the world.
How do you expect to ever be a part of it?

209
00:18:56,711 --> 00:19:01,068
I don't wanna be part of your world,
a manipulative loser who fucks his students.

210
00:19:01,111 --> 00:19:07,505
What do you wanna be? An uptight puritan
who's not even in her own body?

211
00:19:07,551 --> 00:19:11,988
Or a brilliant artist with blood
and a heart and a cunt?

212
00:19:14,351 --> 00:19:16,785
God, you're such a fucking phoney.

213
00:19:16,831 --> 00:19:19,504
At first you actually inspired me.

214
00:19:19,551 --> 00:19:22,623
It took me half a semester
to realise you were using us

215
00:19:22,671 --> 00:19:24,662
to work through your own shit.

216
00:19:24,711 --> 00:19:29,501
When are you gonna get over the fact that you
never became Picasso and now it's too late?

217
00:19:29,551 --> 00:19:34,102
When are you going to get over the fact that if
you take a chance, you might fall on your face?

218
00:19:34,151 --> 00:19:36,904
But that's the best thing
that can ever happen to you,

219
00:19:36,951 --> 00:19:39,704
as an artist and as a human being.

220
00:19:40,431 --> 00:19:43,980
- Are we done?
- Absolutely. Get out of my office.

221
00:19:44,031 --> 00:19:48,024
Who do you think you are, the Pope,
just because I fucked your boyfriend?

222
00:19:48,071 --> 00:19:51,461
What a baby! You need some real pain.

223
00:19:52,351 --> 00:19:55,741
- Fuck you.
- Fuck yourself.

224
00:19:55,791 --> 00:20:00,990
Russell will always be a better artist than you.
He's braver, more willing to take chances.

225
00:20:01,031 --> 00:20:04,068
He's certainly more ambitious.
That seems obvious.

226
00:20:04,111 --> 00:20:07,342
If it hadn't been me, it would have been
somebody else. Trust me.

227
00:20:07,391 --> 00:20:10,064
- I'll take an A.
- Undeserved.

228
00:20:10,111 --> 00:20:12,102
Unimportant.

229
00:20:16,231 --> 00:20:18,984
I know I've already called! I've been call...

230
00:20:19,031 --> 00:20:24,230
My wife is still missing and I can't seem
to get anyone to take me seriously.

231
00:20:26,271 --> 00:20:27,829
Yes.

232
00:20:27,871 --> 00:20:31,705
I have called the sheriffs department
and the highway patrol.

233
00:20:31,751 --> 00:20:33,742
I spoke with Officer Polk.

234
00:20:35,871 --> 00:20:38,943
Go ahead. Thank you.

235
00:20:42,071 --> 00:20:44,062
Yes, I know. Thank you.

236
00:20:45,791 --> 00:20:48,305
No, I will call back in a few hours.

237
00:20:49,591 --> 00:20:51,582
- Any news?
- No.

238
00:20:51,631 --> 00:20:54,828
- I'm gonna take Maya to the park.
- Great.

239
00:20:55,751 --> 00:21:00,461
Nate, dear, everything is going to be fine,
you'll see.

240
00:21:00,511 --> 00:21:04,504
I made some apple crumble.
Why don't you have a piece?

241
00:21:16,591 --> 00:21:21,870
Here's the gentleman who passed away
at the health club. What shall I do with him?

242
00:21:21,911 --> 00:21:25,221
Put him in the reefer.

243
00:21:25,271 --> 00:21:27,990
I believe that the refrigerator is already full.

244
00:21:28,031 --> 00:21:30,420
Then you'll have to leave him out, won't you?

245
00:21:30,471 --> 00:21:35,306
- But that would be a code violation.
- We'll just have to take the risk.

246
00:21:35,351 --> 00:21:39,742
- As long as you both understand that I...
- You're not responsible. We are.

247
00:21:44,391 --> 00:21:46,985
Perhaps I could just try
and make a little more...

248
00:21:47,031 --> 00:21:50,819
Just stop fucking whining
and get the hell out of here already, OK?

249
00:21:53,191 --> 00:21:55,182
OK.

250
00:21:58,751 --> 00:22:01,345
- You all right?
- Not especially.

251
00:22:05,631 --> 00:22:08,191
Is there anything you'd like to talk about?

252
00:22:08,231 --> 00:22:12,019
You really wanna know
or are you just being polite?

253
00:22:13,551 --> 00:22:15,542
I asked, didn't I?

254
00:22:18,911 --> 00:22:22,108
My wife is clinically depressed.

255
00:22:22,151 --> 00:22:26,110
On top of that, my sister-in-law,
who I have problems with on a good day,

256
00:22:26,151 --> 00:22:29,507
is at my house taking care of her right now.

257
00:22:29,551 --> 00:22:32,111
I don't even wanna think about that.

258
00:22:32,151 --> 00:22:36,110
On top of that, these electrocution burns
are a serious bitch.

259
00:22:44,471 --> 00:22:48,225
- Has anybody heard from Lisa yet?
- Not yet, no.

260
00:22:48,271 --> 00:22:50,865
I'm sure it's only a matter of time.

261
00:22:53,711 --> 00:22:56,066
A matter of time before what?

262
00:22:56,111 --> 00:23:00,024
Before she calls and tells us
she's had a little car trouble or...

263
00:23:00,071 --> 00:23:02,869
I don't know, that she's OK.

264
00:23:02,911 --> 00:23:06,347
No one in this family ever talks about
what's really going on.

265
00:23:06,391 --> 00:23:08,222
What is that supposed to mean?

266
00:23:08,271 --> 00:23:14,107
We have to deal with the possibility
that something bad has probably happened.

267
00:23:14,151 --> 00:23:20,021
We do not! You may not believe this,
but I have a lot more life experience than you.

268
00:23:20,071 --> 00:23:24,462
At times like this, it's important
that we keep a positive attitude.

269
00:23:24,511 --> 00:23:26,979
Why must you always be so negative?

270
00:23:27,031 --> 00:23:29,591
Why must you always be in such deep denial?

271
00:23:29,631 --> 00:23:32,429
I am not in denial!

272
00:23:32,471 --> 00:23:37,784
I'm just trying to prepare for the worst,
so that when it happens, it's not so awful.

273
00:23:37,831 --> 00:23:42,461
Well, don't. Lisa is going to turn up
and she's going to be fine

274
00:23:42,511 --> 00:23:46,504
and there'll be a logical explanation
for all of this.

275
00:23:48,191 --> 00:23:50,989
Yeah, you're right.

276
00:23:51,031 --> 00:23:55,263
And they're gonna put an end to world hunger
and people'll stop killing each other

277
00:23:55,311 --> 00:24:00,305
and the oil companies are gonna stop running
everything and apologise for global warming.

278
00:24:00,351 --> 00:24:02,945
I'm sure it's just a matter of time.

279
00:24:25,231 --> 00:24:29,304
When you talked to her, she said she was
at the ocean. Did she say where?

280
00:24:29,351 --> 00:24:32,309
No. She just said it looked nice.

281
00:24:33,391 --> 00:24:38,340
- How long had she been gone?
- Two, maybe three hours.

282
00:24:40,511 --> 00:24:44,299
Long enough to switch to highway one
at San Luis Obispo?

283
00:24:44,351 --> 00:24:49,186
Yeah, maybe. But probably not.
She's not the world's fastest driver.

284
00:24:49,231 --> 00:24:55,067
- Why wouldn't she stay on the 101?
- She wanted to drive through Big Sur.

285
00:24:55,111 --> 00:24:59,502
- She loves Big Sur.
- Did you contact the credit card company?

286
00:25:00,671 --> 00:25:04,346
- She may have stopped to get gas, right?
- Or lunch or a motel room.

287
00:25:04,391 --> 00:25:07,463
Any purchases that might indicate
the car's been stolen.

288
00:25:07,511 --> 00:25:10,708
I should do that right now.

289
00:25:10,751 --> 00:25:14,107
- Hello?
- Hey, Nate. It's me, Brenda.

290
00:25:14,151 --> 00:25:19,783
I just wanted to call and apologise
for last night. It was really unlike me and...

291
00:25:19,831 --> 00:25:22,470
Look, Brenda, I can't talk to you right now.

292
00:25:22,511 --> 00:25:25,981
I've got a lot more important shit
to deal with. Fuck!

293
00:25:35,631 --> 00:25:37,906
Fucking come on.

294
00:25:37,951 --> 00:25:39,748
I'm already on hold.

295
00:25:44,511 --> 00:25:46,502
I'm gonna get going.

296
00:25:47,591 --> 00:25:49,980
I'm gonna stay here.

297
00:25:50,911 --> 00:25:53,220
OK.

298
00:25:54,351 --> 00:25:58,344
- Call you tomorrow?
- Or sooner, if you hear anything.

299
00:26:13,911 --> 00:26:16,709
When I'm feeling a little bit shaky...

300
00:26:16,751 --> 00:26:20,744
OK, so we know that she stopped
for gas in Santa Barbara.

301
00:26:23,231 --> 00:26:29,386
But that was yesterday. You'd think she'd use
the card again between then and now.

302
00:26:29,431 --> 00:26:31,820
Unless she had a lot of cash on her.

303
00:26:33,631 --> 00:26:37,226
She didn't have a lot of cash on her.

304
00:26:37,271 --> 00:26:39,660
At least, I don't think she did.

305
00:26:40,831 --> 00:26:43,061
I can't talk about this any more.

306
00:26:45,231 --> 00:26:47,825
What's going on with you and Keith?

307
00:26:50,031 --> 00:26:52,022
Nothing much.

308
00:26:53,111 --> 00:26:56,183
You guys seemed a little tense tonight.

309
00:26:56,231 --> 00:26:59,746
- You think we were tense?
- Yeah.

310
00:27:01,071 --> 00:27:03,062
I guess we are.

311
00:27:05,271 --> 00:27:09,867
We had this big fight down in San Diego
in front of his mom and dad.

312
00:27:09,911 --> 00:27:13,790
I butted in. Maybe I shouldn't have.

313
00:27:14,831 --> 00:27:17,220
Now I don't know where we are.

314
00:27:18,551 --> 00:27:22,863
We love each other. At least, I think we do.

315
00:27:25,591 --> 00:27:30,585
Lately, though, I just feel numb
when we're together,

316
00:27:31,391 --> 00:27:33,586
and better when we're not.

317
00:27:35,031 --> 00:27:38,990
It's not like we don't want
the same things. We do.

318
00:27:39,031 --> 00:27:45,300
I think. Maybe we don't want the same things.
Maybe we're just pretending that we do.

319
00:27:46,791 --> 00:27:49,783
Maybe we're just not meant to be together.

320
00:28:04,791 --> 00:28:09,865
...artefacts from the near and distant past
were emerging from the ice.

321
00:28:09,911 --> 00:28:15,383
Steven Hiller reports on the discovery
of archaeological treasure. Steven.

322
00:28:15,431 --> 00:28:20,664
During the short Siberian summer,
our anthropologists discovered...

323
00:28:22,591 --> 00:28:24,866
Hey, sweetie.

324
00:28:26,951 --> 00:28:29,146
Hi, my love.

325
00:28:30,991 --> 00:28:34,028
Where the fuck have you been?

326
00:28:34,071 --> 00:28:38,622
Do you know how worried I've been,
how worried we've all been?

327
00:28:38,671 --> 00:28:41,344
I filed a fucking
missing persons report on you.

328
00:28:41,391 --> 00:28:46,419
- Oh, my God. I am so sorry.
- Why the fuck didn't you at least call me?

329
00:28:46,471 --> 00:28:49,543
I left 100 fucking messages
for you on your cellphone.

330
00:28:49,591 --> 00:28:54,949
- I must have turned it off after you called me.
- Jesus Christ.

331
00:28:54,991 --> 00:29:00,065
Jesus Christ. Don't ever fucking do that again.

332
00:29:02,071 --> 00:29:03,868
Oh, God.

333
00:29:24,751 --> 00:29:26,742
Come here.

334
00:29:36,391 --> 00:29:38,666
- Did she call?
- No.

335
00:29:38,711 --> 00:29:42,226
Can you watch Maya for me,
just for a little while?

336
00:29:42,271 --> 00:29:44,831
- I'm just gonna get some air.
- OK.

337
00:29:44,871 --> 00:29:46,862
There you go.

338
00:30:29,391 --> 00:30:30,949
Nate.

339
00:30:36,311 --> 00:30:38,506
Hello? Speaking.

340
00:30:39,351 --> 00:30:41,819
What? Where?

341
00:30:41,871 --> 00:30:43,623
Yes.

342
00:30:43,671 --> 00:30:45,662
I'm on my way.

343
00:30:47,151 --> 00:30:49,540
They found her car.

344
00:30:53,151 --> 00:30:58,862
It's totally cool. The streets are old-timey and
there's an anthropology and a Nike goddess.

345
00:30:58,911 --> 00:31:01,948
Everything is as clean as Disneyland,
even the bathrooms.

346
00:31:01,991 --> 00:31:06,428
- What are you guys talking about?
- The new shopping mall.

347
00:31:06,471 --> 00:31:09,383
- The Grove.
- I don't know why we haven't been.

348
00:31:09,431 --> 00:31:13,106
There's a dance lesson tonight.
You feel up to it?

349
00:31:14,191 --> 00:31:16,500
I don't know. But maybe.

350
00:31:16,551 --> 00:31:21,102
If we're gonna cancel, we should let
them know, otherwise they'll charge us.

351
00:31:21,991 --> 00:31:26,189
- Can we decide later?
- Call me at work after lunch.

352
00:31:26,231 --> 00:31:28,620
- OK, I will.
- OK.

353
00:31:31,231 --> 00:31:34,507
- I need the credit card.
- What for?

354
00:31:34,551 --> 00:31:39,864
I'm taking her shopping.
A little shopping is good for depression.

355
00:31:39,911 --> 00:31:42,141
- You're gonna go shopping?
- It'll be fun.

356
00:31:42,191 --> 00:31:47,788
We're just gonna get her a new pair of shoes.
Maybe lunch at Farmers Market.

357
00:31:47,831 --> 00:31:51,267
- Please.
- Of course.

358
00:31:52,471 --> 00:31:55,110
- Here.
- Thank you, baby.

359
00:32:00,951 --> 00:32:03,749
Where did he want his ashes spread?

360
00:32:03,791 --> 00:32:06,100
He told me to surprise him.

361
00:32:08,511 --> 00:32:14,143
- Maybe we should take him out to Catalina.
- I'm pretty sure you need a permit for that.

362
00:32:14,191 --> 00:32:18,025
Why don't I put him in my backpack
and no one's the wiser?

363
00:32:23,231 --> 00:32:28,021
Are you two not speaking to one another?
It's really starting to annoy me.

364
00:32:28,071 --> 00:32:30,505
- Can we do this? Then I can go.
- I'm speaking.

365
00:32:30,551 --> 00:32:35,466
OK, whatever, but I am not going out
to Catalina in some goddamn boat

366
00:32:35,511 --> 00:32:39,424
just because you were there once
when you were 12.

367
00:32:39,471 --> 00:32:44,022
- What about the beach in Malibu?
- That's where everyone throws their ashes.

368
00:32:44,071 --> 00:32:47,825
- So?
- I don't want him co-mingling with strangers.

369
00:32:49,671 --> 00:32:54,108
We drive him up into Angeles National Forest
and plant a tree.

370
00:32:54,151 --> 00:32:57,302
Plant a tree? You must be kidding.

371
00:32:59,031 --> 00:33:03,263
- Then I say we drive him to Malibu.
- I'm not going all the way out to Malibu.

372
00:33:03,311 --> 00:33:07,304
Besides, the traffic'll kill us on the way home.

373
00:33:07,351 --> 00:33:11,105
This is giving me such a goddamn headache.

374
00:33:11,791 --> 00:33:13,782
Fuck it.

375
00:33:25,711 --> 00:33:29,943
There. Now he'll be
in Westwood for all eternity.

376
00:33:55,711 --> 00:33:58,987
- What?
- We need your help, Claire.

377
00:33:59,031 --> 00:34:01,670
I'm kind of in the middle
of something right now.

378
00:34:01,711 --> 00:34:04,179
Hurry it up.

379
00:34:15,271 --> 00:34:16,943
What am I supposed to do?

380
00:34:16,991 --> 00:34:21,701
Give these to people and make sure
they're here to see Mrs Su.

381
00:34:22,551 --> 00:34:26,021
- You need help for that?
- Yes.

382
00:34:26,071 --> 00:34:30,462
And smile. Not too much.
Compassionate but not happy.

383
00:34:30,511 --> 00:34:32,502
That should be no problem.

384
00:34:33,511 --> 00:34:36,583
- Mrs Su?
- Mr Tully.

385
00:34:38,791 --> 00:34:40,782
He's in there.

386
00:34:44,071 --> 00:34:46,107
What's up with you?

387
00:34:46,151 --> 00:34:49,666
Nothing's up with me.
Am I not allowed to be in a bad mood?

388
00:34:49,711 --> 00:34:51,906
If that's what you want.

389
00:34:53,551 --> 00:34:57,863
My boyfriend had sex with another guy
and we broke up. Are you happy?

390
00:34:57,911 --> 00:35:00,983
- I'm so sorry.
- What is it with you people?

391
00:35:01,031 --> 00:35:07,550
You can't figure out what you are, so you've
gotta string along girls to ease the transition?

392
00:35:08,911 --> 00:35:11,300
Mrs Su or Mr Tully?

393
00:35:11,351 --> 00:35:13,911
Mrs Su, please.

394
00:35:13,951 --> 00:35:16,146
Right through here.

395
00:35:17,551 --> 00:35:22,466
It's probably best you found out about Russell
now before it went any further.

396
00:35:22,511 --> 00:35:26,470
The timing of all this is just so fucking perfect,
it's not even funny.

397
00:35:26,511 --> 00:35:28,741
What do you mean?

398
00:35:30,991 --> 00:35:33,505
With what's going on with Lisa,

399
00:35:33,551 --> 00:35:36,827
and how terrible things
always happen at the same time,

400
00:35:36,871 --> 00:35:40,989
like when those celebrities die in sets of three.

401
00:35:41,031 --> 00:35:43,420
Mrs Su? Right this way.

402
00:35:47,271 --> 00:35:51,662
- You don't think Lisa might have...
- What? Offed herself? No way.

403
00:35:51,711 --> 00:35:55,909
Things seemed pretty tense
between her and Nate for a while there.

404
00:35:55,951 --> 00:36:00,786
She had that weird look in her eye, like it
wouldn't take much to send her over the edge.

405
00:36:00,831 --> 00:36:06,030
There's no way Lisa would do
anything like that, not with the baby.

406
00:36:15,991 --> 00:36:19,381
- How are we doing?
- So far, so good.

407
00:36:19,431 --> 00:36:24,551
We've only got about half an hour, an hour
tops, to get the Sus out of the pastoral room

408
00:36:24,591 --> 00:36:26,786
so we can get Mr Monroe in there.

409
00:36:26,831 --> 00:36:29,982
- Goodness. We're not gonna make it.
- Of course we will.

410
00:36:30,031 --> 00:36:32,386
We don't have a choice.

411
00:36:33,511 --> 00:36:35,979
You must be here for Edward Tully.

412
00:36:36,031 --> 00:36:38,909
No. I'm here for Dorothy Su.

413
00:36:38,951 --> 00:36:41,545
- Am I in the wrong place?
- Over there.

414
00:36:41,591 --> 00:36:46,381
I parked on the street right in front.
I'm not going to get a ticket there, am I?

415
00:36:46,431 --> 00:36:49,582
- You should be fine.
- Thank you.

416
00:36:52,551 --> 00:36:55,349
- He could get a ticket.
- It'll take too long to move it.

417
00:36:55,391 --> 00:36:59,862
When we're in the weeds the way we are
today, you gotta move 'em in and 'out.

418
00:37:02,431 --> 00:37:05,389
You don't understand. This is my wife's car.

419
00:37:05,431 --> 00:37:08,582
She didn't just leave it here and disappear.

420
00:37:08,631 --> 00:37:13,910
There's her cellphone, her wallet and her
overnight bag, but her backpack's missing.

421
00:37:13,951 --> 00:37:16,704
- You checked the trunk?
- It's not in there.

422
00:37:16,751 --> 00:37:19,663
And also Lisa doesn't drink Dr Pepper.

423
00:37:19,711 --> 00:37:22,862
She doesn't drink soda at all.
She thinks it's toxic.

424
00:37:22,911 --> 00:37:25,550
- I'm sorry, Mr...?
- Fisher.

425
00:37:25,591 --> 00:37:28,708
We've got a missing persons report on file.

426
00:37:28,751 --> 00:37:33,506
A missing backpack and a can of Dr Pepper
is not evidence of foul play.

427
00:37:33,551 --> 00:37:38,386
Without evidence of foul play, we can't treat
this as anything more than it appears to be -

428
00:37:38,431 --> 00:37:40,991
a missing person's case.

429
00:37:41,031 --> 00:37:45,104
I'm not gonna pretend there's nothing
to worry about. Possibly there is.

430
00:37:45,151 --> 00:37:49,986
- My wife is fucking missing!
- I can see that you are genuinely distressed.

431
00:37:50,031 --> 00:37:54,149
But at this point,
there isn't a whole lot I can do.

432
00:37:54,191 --> 00:37:59,311
If it were me, I'd stick around the area, in case
she finds her way back to pick up her car.

433
00:37:59,351 --> 00:38:02,070
There's a motel just up the way.

434
00:38:02,111 --> 00:38:04,784
I would make sure to move it
by this time tomorrow,

435
00:38:04,831 --> 00:38:07,823
unless you want it towed to the impound lot.

436
00:38:25,631 --> 00:38:28,099
God, how long is she gonna go on like this?

437
00:38:28,911 --> 00:38:31,789
With any luck,
she'll throw herself over the railing.

438
00:38:35,671 --> 00:38:39,061
Tell Roberta Flack I couldn't take it any more.

439
00:38:39,111 --> 00:38:41,261
- We have to talk.
- No, we don't.

440
00:38:42,031 --> 00:38:44,022
What is there to say?

441
00:38:44,071 --> 00:38:47,188
- I'm in love with you.
- Jesus, don't.

442
00:38:47,231 --> 00:38:51,224
I need to say it. I need to say it.

443
00:38:53,631 --> 00:38:56,145
I know I can't have you.

444
00:38:56,191 --> 00:39:00,423
I know it's wrong to want you like this,

445
00:39:00,471 --> 00:39:03,269
but that doesn't make it any less true.

446
00:39:05,071 --> 00:39:09,667
- And what am I supposed to do with that?
- Nothing.

447
00:39:09,711 --> 00:39:13,989
I have to... let it go.

448
00:39:14,991 --> 00:39:18,870
And maybe saying the words will help.

449
00:39:22,591 --> 00:39:24,582
I want to let it go.

450
00:39:27,711 --> 00:39:29,702
You have to believe that.

451
00:39:43,591 --> 00:39:47,903
I just have a feeling about this
and everything is going to be all right.

452
00:39:47,951 --> 00:39:52,900
- I've always been right about my feelings.
- Mom, they found her car.

453
00:39:52,951 --> 00:39:56,910
There are a hundred explanations for that.
She could have run out of gas.

454
00:39:56,951 --> 00:40:00,023
She has a triple A card, a cellphone.
She would have called.

455
00:40:00,071 --> 00:40:03,780
- Maybe the battery went dead.
- I just want you to be prepared.

456
00:40:03,831 --> 00:40:09,303
I am sick of hearing that! I will not be prepared
and neither should anyone else.

457
00:40:09,351 --> 00:40:12,741
I refuse to believe that anything is wrong.

458
00:40:13,511 --> 00:40:15,502
I have to trust my feelings.

459
00:40:17,071 --> 00:40:19,460
Right now they're all I have.

460
00:40:35,031 --> 00:40:37,670
Just where do you think you are going?

461
00:40:37,711 --> 00:40:42,068
To relax in my study with a nice cup of tea,
my succulent compote.

462
00:40:42,111 --> 00:40:45,581
You may have some tea later
after you find those rats.

463
00:40:45,631 --> 00:40:49,749
- What the hell is all of this?
- What?

464
00:40:49,791 --> 00:40:53,704
The TV. A refrigerator?

465
00:40:55,271 --> 00:40:58,786
The delivery guys couldn't get the refrigerator
through the door.

466
00:40:58,831 --> 00:41:01,550
You have to take out those old cabinets first.

467
00:41:01,591 --> 00:41:03,582
Oh, my God.

468
00:41:03,631 --> 00:41:07,704
Oh, my God. OK. Julio.

469
00:41:09,111 --> 00:41:12,865
Come on. Get your brother.
Let's go in the other room.

470
00:41:17,431 --> 00:41:20,104
- Where's Vanessa?
- She's asleep.

471
00:41:20,151 --> 00:41:23,621
- We have a dance lesson tonight.
- Wake her up if you want to.

472
00:41:23,671 --> 00:41:26,504
But if I were you, I would let her sleep.

473
00:41:29,511 --> 00:41:32,901
You told me you were taking her shopping
for a new pair of shoes.

474
00:41:32,951 --> 00:41:35,863
- Don't start with me.
- We cannot afford this shit.

475
00:41:35,911 --> 00:41:41,190
Bullshit! You are a partner.
You have the money and she wanted them.

476
00:41:41,231 --> 00:41:47,579
- She never gets anything for herself.
- We have a rule, Angelica.

477
00:41:47,631 --> 00:41:51,419
If we're gonna spend more than $100,
we check in with each other.

478
00:41:51,471 --> 00:41:54,224
- She knew you'd be pissed.
- I am pissed!

479
00:41:58,031 --> 00:42:01,865
She takes care of your kids every single day

480
00:42:01,911 --> 00:42:05,460
and works a full-time job on top of that.

481
00:42:05,511 --> 00:42:08,742
Look at this place.
No wonder she's depressed.

482
00:42:08,791 --> 00:42:12,386
So she bought a new TV
and a new refrigerator.

483
00:42:12,431 --> 00:42:15,628
They were both on sale.
Give her a fucking break.

484
00:42:15,671 --> 00:42:18,504
She deserves it.

485
00:42:36,191 --> 00:42:38,625
- May I help you?
- Thank you.

486
00:42:38,671 --> 00:42:42,380
I was here earlier today
for Dorothy Su's funeral.

487
00:42:42,431 --> 00:42:45,070
I think I may have left my reading glasses.

488
00:42:49,951 --> 00:42:54,069
I think I was sitting here.
Maybe it was over here.

489
00:42:57,111 --> 00:43:01,104
Here they are. I misplace them all the time.

490
00:43:03,511 --> 00:43:05,900
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

491
00:43:09,591 --> 00:43:14,984
I feel terrible, although to be perfectly honest,
I really didn't know Mrs Su.

492
00:43:16,151 --> 00:43:21,145
I used to see her every morning, though.
It's where I get my newspaper.

493
00:43:23,311 --> 00:43:26,667
- I'm sorry. Did I say something wrong?
- No.

494
00:43:30,271 --> 00:43:35,026
My daughter-in-law's missing and I thought
I had a feeling things would turn out all right,

495
00:43:35,071 --> 00:43:38,950
but now they've found her car
and I still have a feeling,

496
00:43:38,991 --> 00:43:43,826
only now it's a feeling
that something terrible has happened.

497
00:43:58,351 --> 00:44:04,824
I'm so sorry. I just cried all over your jacket
and you're a complete stranger.

498
00:44:06,391 --> 00:44:08,700
Not any more, I'm not.

499
00:44:18,351 --> 00:44:21,741
I'd have been more than happy
to bring some stuff over.

500
00:44:21,791 --> 00:44:24,180
No, thanks. This way is easier.

501
00:44:25,911 --> 00:44:29,824
So how's everybody holding up?

502
00:44:29,871 --> 00:44:32,749
About as well as can be expected.

503
00:44:32,791 --> 00:44:36,864
My buddy at the sheriffs department put it
on the state-wide Teletype system.

504
00:44:36,911 --> 00:44:40,142
Thank you for doing that.

505
00:44:40,191 --> 00:44:43,547
- I didn't do anything. I just made a phone call.
- Well...

506
00:44:43,591 --> 00:44:46,344
Thank you for being there.

507
00:44:46,391 --> 00:44:48,905
Here. Whatever.

508
00:44:56,431 --> 00:44:59,946
- How are you doing?
- Me? Fine.

509
00:45:00,671 --> 00:45:03,026
Liar.

510
00:45:05,631 --> 00:45:08,191
You wanna stay for a little while?

511
00:45:08,231 --> 00:45:10,586
No.

512
00:45:10,631 --> 00:45:14,544
I just don't think that would be
such a good idea right now.

513
00:45:14,591 --> 00:45:18,982
OK, then. Call me if you hear anything.

514
00:45:19,031 --> 00:45:22,944
- Or need anything.
- I will.

515
00:46:30,791 --> 00:46:33,908
We thought maybe
you could use some company.
