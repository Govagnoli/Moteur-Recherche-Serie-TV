Saison 5 Episode 4
"Time Flies"

8
00:02:06,226 --> 00:02:08,868
Once again no rain,
but mostly high clouds.

9
00:02:08,934 --> 00:02:10,512
Since you got so much
information, can you tell us

10
00:02:10,578 --> 00:02:12,066
Why it smells like
skunk outside the studio

11
00:02:12,085 --> 00:02:14,592
- In hollywood here?
- It does?

12
00:02:15,859 --> 00:02:18,067
Sam, do you know why that is?

13
00:03:21,295 --> 00:03:23,567
Okay. Okay, now!

14
00:03:23,708 --> 00:03:25,701
Happy birthday!

15
00:03:25,929 --> 00:03:27,734
Well, thank you.

16
00:03:27,783 --> 00:03:29,767
Thank you very much.

17
00:03:31,459 --> 00:03:34,167
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you.

18
00:03:37,196 --> 00:03:40,734
- Are you excited to see all your friends at daycare?
- Yeah.

19
00:03:42,595 --> 00:03:45,116
Did you notice anything in the bathroom?

20
00:03:45,229 --> 00:03:47,065
Aside from a few new wrinkles, no.

21
00:03:47,159 --> 00:03:49,501
It was right by the toilet.

22
00:03:51,201 --> 00:03:52,300
Are you pregnant?

23
00:03:52,778 --> 00:03:54,400
Yes.

24
00:03:55,591 --> 00:03:58,200
That's great! Congratulations!

25
00:03:58,412 --> 00:04:00,567
Congratulations? To whom?

26
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,434
- Come on, what am I supposed to say?
- Nothing.

27
00:04:03,483 --> 00:04:06,467
- To you, to all of us!
- No no, whatever comes up in your head.

28
00:04:06,746 --> 00:04:08,121
- Brenda, what's the matter?
- No, nothing.

29
00:04:08,224 --> 00:04:10,267
Thank you for your
hearty congratulations.

30
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:12,422
- Come on, honey.
- Are you sure it's positive?

31
00:04:12,478 --> 00:04:15,000
There you go, honey bun.
Maya's gonna be late.

32
00:04:15,067 --> 00:04:16,990
Brenda, I'm happy, I...

33
00:04:17,628 --> 00:04:20,000
Come on, grab hold. Come on, baby.

34
00:04:20,454 --> 00:04:22,179
- Brenda- - See you tonight,
i gotta get ready for work.

35
00:04:22,197 --> 00:04:24,319
I'm happy, just tell me again.

36
00:04:33,567 --> 00:04:35,698
Fuck!

37
00:04:35,745 --> 00:04:38,200
Have you seen my ski
iraq shirt anywhere?

38
00:04:38,304 --> 00:04:40,276
- You had that on last night.
- Yeah, I didn't ask

39
00:04:40,313 --> 00:04:43,200
Whether I had it on last night,
i asked whether you've seen it.

40
00:04:43,529 --> 00:04:45,167
I haven't.

41
00:04:45,825 --> 00:04:46,667
Shit!

42
00:04:47,642 --> 00:04:48,901
What is your problem?!

43
00:04:50,684 --> 00:04:53,212
Nothing, I just don't think
I can wear clothes today.

44
00:04:55,067 --> 00:04:56,532
Don't you have class?

45
00:04:56,579 --> 00:04:58,934
Yeah, well, nothing feels right.

46
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,267
Look, maybe you should like
see a doctor or something.

47
00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:04,546
For what?

48
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:07,033
I don't know, dry skin?

49
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,870
- Are you fucking serious?
- Well, yeah,

50
00:05:10,123 --> 00:05:12,541
Look, I don't know, every day with
you it's like a bigger problem.

51
00:05:12,579 --> 00:05:15,635
Not everything is something
that you can medicate, Claire!

52
00:05:15,654 --> 00:05:17,814
I know that.

53
00:05:18,189 --> 00:05:20,267
It's just my clothes are...

54
00:05:20,537 --> 00:05:22,300
All heavy today...

55
00:05:23,072 --> 00:05:25,367
Or something. I want my ski iraq shirt.

56
00:05:28,133 --> 00:05:30,567
Okay, I'll help you find it.

57
00:05:31,283 --> 00:05:32,634
Okay, thanks.

58
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:37,834
That's all
i wanted was some help.

59
00:05:38,424 --> 00:05:39,901
Okay.

60
00:05:43,344 --> 00:05:45,062
Okay.

61
00:05:45,607 --> 00:05:48,667
Shit, I feel like I still
have something on.

62
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:54,300
Mary, keith and david have
something they want to ask you.

63
00:05:54,367 --> 00:05:56,344
I'm on pins and needles.

64
00:05:56,494 --> 00:05:59,267
We've decided that we
want y to be our egg donor

65
00:05:59,424 --> 00:06:01,033
And our surrogate.

66
00:06:01,424 --> 00:06:03,757
- Both?
- Is that okay?

67
00:06:03,776 --> 00:06:07,114
Yeah, it's just I've never
been proposed to like this.

68
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:09,300
Most people are so businesslike.

69
00:06:09,335 --> 00:06:11,300
You guys are so sweet.

70
00:06:11,368 --> 00:06:13,701
- Whose seed will it be?
- His.

71
00:06:14,969 --> 00:06:18,504
So this is something that you would
want to do for Keith and David?

72
00:06:18,964 --> 00:06:20,074
Yeah, I'd love it.

73
00:06:20,102 --> 00:06:22,529
- I didn't say yes?
- Uh, no.

74
00:06:22,599 --> 00:06:24,866
Oh, then yes yes, of course, yes!

75
00:06:25,308 --> 00:06:27,650
Well, good.

76
00:06:28,477 --> 00:06:30,033
Can I ask a question?

77
00:06:30,801 --> 00:06:34,143
Please, david.
We're in this together. Ask ask ask.

78
00:06:34,693 --> 00:06:37,073
Is there caffeine in that?

79
00:06:38,509 --> 00:06:39,782
We're into that already.

80
00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:42,350
Okay. It was so nice for a minute there.

81
00:06:42,575 --> 00:06:45,200
No, I was just thinking-
I've read some books

82
00:06:45,256 --> 00:06:47,934
That say caffeine makes
it harder to conceive...

83
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,400
Sometimes, that's all. Just curious.

84
00:06:50,594 --> 00:06:52,007
Maybe you've read something different.

85
00:06:52,063 --> 00:06:55,334
I get pregnant super-easily,
David, trust me.

86
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,322
It's kind of unsettling.

87
00:06:57,453 --> 00:06:59,641
- Okay.
- But I assure you,

88
00:06:59,716 --> 00:07:02,331
Once we've signed the
papers I will look forward

89
00:07:02,359 --> 00:07:04,448
To working very close
with you to make sure

90
00:07:04,467 --> 00:07:06,622
Our baby is healthy and gets conceived.

91
00:07:06,932 --> 00:07:08,434
Thank you.

92
00:07:08,744 --> 00:07:11,534
Gosh, I'm extra excited. Aren't you?

93
00:07:12,026 --> 00:07:15,801
Well, I think we're all very excited.

94
00:07:16,181 --> 00:07:19,326
- Are you finished with your eggs?
- I'm done, thank you.

95
00:07:19,505 --> 00:07:21,927
When I saw the built-ins,
I fell totally in love,

96
00:07:21,946 --> 00:07:24,063
And I put my name on the
list. The owner calls me

97
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:26,186
Yesterday morning, he said
I could have the place.

98
00:07:26,251 --> 00:07:28,400
But then he called back
an hour later and said

99
00:07:28,467 --> 00:07:30,721
He wasn't renting it,
he was gonna sell it.

100
00:07:30,786 --> 00:07:32,707
Oh, that's so annoying.

101
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:35,312
Whatever, I'll find a place, I guess.

102
00:07:35,472 --> 00:07:37,901
- It's all good.
- Time's up.

103
00:07:38,322 --> 00:07:40,561
Oh, I was just finding my rhythm.

104
00:07:40,646 --> 00:07:42,397
Next week we start our capelets,

105
00:07:42,697 --> 00:07:45,901
So pick out some colorful
stuff and get ready.

106
00:07:46,232 --> 00:07:48,434
And remember your class fees include

107
00:07:48,453 --> 00:07:50,501
Unlimited knitting circle time,

108
00:07:51,143 --> 00:07:52,834
So feel free to drop in whenever.

109
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:54,599
- See you next time.
- Ciao-Ciao, victoria.

110
00:07:54,664 --> 00:07:56,054
Ciao.

111
00:07:57,463 --> 00:07:59,400
Suddenly one "ciao" was not enough.

112
00:07:59,589 --> 00:08:01,434
She says everything twice.

113
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:04,073
So...

114
00:08:04,702 --> 00:08:07,100
Give us the george report.

115
00:08:08,594 --> 00:08:10,868
Well, this week has not been a cakewalk

116
00:08:11,923 --> 00:08:15,129
You don't know what a relief it was
To walk in here and sit down.

117
00:08:15,514 --> 00:08:17,200
What happened?

118
00:08:17,359 --> 00:08:19,965
Oh, he started another
round of electroshock,

119
00:08:20,078 --> 00:08:22,167
Because George and
Maggie think it helps.

120
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:26,697
But the days after the treatments are
Such a challenge for me.

121
00:08:27,284 --> 00:08:30,901
He comes home so scattered. It's
like dealing with a sleepwalker.

122
00:08:31,256 --> 00:08:33,552
I don't know where you find
the strength to deal with it.

123
00:08:33,711 --> 00:08:36,234
Clearly, I don't either.

124
00:08:37,143 --> 00:08:39,167
Have you signed up
for next week's class?

125
00:08:39,542 --> 00:08:40,721
I haven't yet, no.

126
00:08:41,021 --> 00:08:43,603
Oh, ruth, you must. You're
the only version of my mother

127
00:08:43,622 --> 00:08:46,571
- I can talk to.
- I'll try and make it.

128
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,033
It's all good, right?

129
00:08:52,256 --> 00:08:53,467
Yeah, it is.

130
00:08:57,007 --> 00:09:00,768
Well, I have errands to run,
and Maggie's waiting.

131
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:04,868
- Bye.
- Bye.

132
00:09:22,578 --> 00:09:26,701
Lila was the most active
person I ever met in my life.

133
00:09:27,090 --> 00:09:31,597
I mean, I try to stay busy
With bridge and the angels.

134
00:09:32,261 --> 00:09:34,200
I'm a big angel fan.

135
00:09:34,284 --> 00:09:36,049
- I can see that.
- But lila,

136
00:09:36,237 --> 00:09:38,317
She was a runaway train!

137
00:09:38,401 --> 00:09:41,617
It's so hard to believe
that she won't be outside

138
00:09:41,664 --> 00:09:45,367
Messing around with her
flowers when I get home.

139
00:09:45,824 --> 00:09:47,960
Are you sure she never
married or had any children?

140
00:09:48,063 --> 00:09:50,096
Oh, she was going to,

141
00:09:50,181 --> 00:09:53,501
But her beau died very young.

142
00:09:54,317 --> 00:09:56,875
After that she ran a resort

143
00:09:56,922 --> 00:09:59,317
Up in Ojal all on her own.

144
00:10:00,143 --> 00:10:02,901
There were families that
came there every year,

145
00:10:02,968 --> 00:10:05,162
And then their kids would come

146
00:10:05,218 --> 00:10:06,918
And their kids would come

147
00:10:06,974 --> 00:10:09,298
And they all kept up with her.

148
00:10:09,674 --> 00:10:11,575
No one in the neighborhood

149
00:10:11,838 --> 00:10:15,434
Got more christmas cards
or visits than Lila.

150
00:10:15,801 --> 00:10:19,481
- Sounds like a good life.
- It was.

151
00:10:19,603 --> 00:10:22,934
Today would have been her 95th birthday.

152
00:10:26,218 --> 00:10:28,039
What?

153
00:10:28,584 --> 00:10:30,898
Well, today is his birthday too.

154
00:10:32,434 --> 00:10:34,667
Oh, how old are you?

155
00:10:34,861 --> 00:10:38,434
- I'm 40.
- Oh, you don't look that old.

156
00:10:38,546 --> 00:10:41,182
- Thank you.
- Are you doing something special?

157
00:10:41,539 --> 00:10:42,634
- Not today,

158
00:10:42,701 --> 00:10:46,346
But my wife and daughter are gonna
take me up to Big Sur next weekend.

159
00:10:48,253 --> 00:10:49,667
Oh. Big sur.

160
00:10:50,666 --> 00:10:53,567
It's so beautiful up there.

161
00:10:54,501 --> 00:10:58,434
So stunning!

162
00:11:02,667 --> 00:11:05,609
I suppose I'll be gone soon too.

163
00:11:06,689 --> 00:11:08,067
I will.

164
00:11:09,538 --> 00:11:12,267
That's okay.

165
00:11:12,934 --> 00:11:15,267
It happens.

166
00:11:17,497 --> 00:11:20,735
Couldn't you say, "roger, partner and
I plan to spend the morning together,

167
00:11:20,763 --> 00:11:22,634
I can't pick up your cat at the vet"?

168
00:11:22,690 --> 00:11:23,935
David, let it go.

169
00:11:23,954 --> 00:11:26,409
Why can't he get one of
his abercrombie & fitch

170
00:11:26,456 --> 00:11:28,268
Party boys to do something like this?

171
00:11:28,306 --> 00:11:30,249
You're a bodyguard,

172
00:11:30,353 --> 00:11:32,832
And I'd like to get to
work at some point today.

173
00:11:32,869 --> 00:11:35,367
Do you like your new plasma tv?

174
00:11:35,803 --> 00:11:38,747
- I do.
- Then let it go.

175
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:41,734
That cat stinks.

176
00:11:42,546 --> 00:11:43,968
Keith charles!

177
00:11:44,191 --> 00:11:47,036
- And you must be David!
- Yes.

178
00:11:47,187 --> 00:11:48,742
Sissy pasquese.

179
00:11:48,827 --> 00:11:51,501
Come on in. Roger's making kir royales.

180
00:11:52,684 --> 00:11:54,036
- Sister?
- I don't know.

181
00:11:54,064 --> 00:11:56,919
- The kids are almost ready.
- Kids? Ex-Wife?

182
00:11:56,965 --> 00:11:59,134
- I don't know!
- How could you not know?

183
00:11:59,294 --> 00:12:02,486
David, we're married,
Roger's gay, and I'm fine with it.

184
00:12:02,604 --> 00:12:05,294
But we keep it quiet, because
we're very private people.

185
00:12:05,904 --> 00:12:07,665
Thank you.

186
00:12:08,402 --> 00:12:12,176
- That's all I needed.
- Honey, guess who's here.

187
00:12:19,421 --> 00:12:21,234
- Hello.
- Mr. Diaz?

188
00:12:21,369 --> 00:12:22,547
Yes, who is this?

189
00:12:22,594 --> 00:12:24,754
Agnes, I work for the campbells.

190
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:27,434
Julio came home with lucas after school.

191
00:12:28,568 --> 00:12:31,392
Well, he kind of needs to be picked up.

192
00:12:32,018 --> 00:12:35,896
Okay, my wife vanessa should be
there in a little bit, I think

193
00:12:36,063 --> 00:12:37,669
No, we called her like 10 times,

194
00:12:37,735 --> 00:12:39,392
And she's not answering
her phone or something,

195
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:42,721
And the campbells left for
arrowhead like an hour ago.

196
00:12:44,934 --> 00:12:46,934
I'm sorry. I'll be right over.

197
00:12:49,115 --> 00:12:50,782
And I told roger 10 years ago,

198
00:12:50,829 --> 00:12:53,350
"Roger, I want out of this goddamn L.A.

199
00:12:53,434 --> 00:12:56,067
It's a plague. I want to go home."

200
00:12:56,195 --> 00:12:57,542
I haven't been back here since,

201
00:12:57,570 --> 00:13:00,322
Except for two-Day trips,
three-Day trips, right?

202
00:13:00,594 --> 00:13:02,261
I miss her when she's gone.

203
00:13:02,411 --> 00:13:04,815
I'm an aspen girl, what can I say?

204
00:13:06,002 --> 00:13:07,941
So, what brings you to town?

205
00:13:08,016 --> 00:13:10,031
A pedunculated fibroid.

206
00:13:11,185 --> 00:13:13,106
Shit for me, huh?

207
00:13:13,622 --> 00:13:16,300
And Tate and Enzo need haircuts.

208
00:13:16,791 --> 00:13:19,969
So, Roger tells me you two
are thinking of adopting.

209
00:13:20,749 --> 00:13:23,077
Looks like that's not happening anymore.

210
00:13:23,218 --> 00:13:24,937
Because you bit roger?

211
00:13:25,715 --> 00:13:27,199
No.

212
00:13:27,903 --> 00:13:29,288
It got complicated.

213
00:13:29,401 --> 00:13:31,534
Shit for you guys, huh?

214
00:13:32,541 --> 00:13:34,739
Keith, you think you could
run the kids by laissez-Faire

215
00:13:34,757 --> 00:13:36,513
While I take sissy to the doctor?

216
00:13:36,739 --> 00:13:40,983
Uh, we actually have an errand
That we need to run at some point.

217
00:13:43,119 --> 00:13:45,640
It's on the way. We'll take them.

218
00:13:46,297 --> 00:13:47,635
Thanks.

219
00:13:48,795 --> 00:13:50,701
Honey, the cat still reeks.

220
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:52,968
I know, I know.

221
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:56,786
People do things for
other people. That's okay.

222
00:13:56,861 --> 00:13:58,771
Well, I don't want him
to do it just for me.

223
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,579
- Why the hell not?
- Because I want him

224
00:14:00,626 --> 00:14:02,269
To want to have our baby,

225
00:14:02,288 --> 00:14:04,715
Not to do me the favor
of letting me have mine.

226
00:14:04,809 --> 00:14:06,898
Don't be weirder about this
than you absolutely have to be.

227
00:14:06,926 --> 00:14:08,879
But he should want to
have this as much as I do.

228
00:14:09,039 --> 00:14:11,448
- He has maya already.
- No, it's not the same thing.

229
00:14:11,476 --> 00:14:13,875
Then maybe he's afraid
of losing another one.

230
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:15,607
You know? And anyway,

231
00:14:15,804 --> 00:14:18,429
Let's say he is doing it just
for you. Is that so terrible?

232
00:14:19,246 --> 00:14:23,053
We had sylvia for all
the perfect both-of-us reasons,

233
00:14:23,138 --> 00:14:24,847
And I had Josh for Mark,

234
00:14:24,912 --> 00:14:27,415
Because he couldn't
imagine life without a boy.

235
00:14:27,734 --> 00:14:30,200
I was happy with one.

236
00:14:31,715 --> 00:14:33,786
Can you not tell anyone
about the pregnancy?

237
00:14:33,842 --> 00:14:35,391
- Fuck you.
- No, I want to wait this time

238
00:14:35,401 --> 00:14:37,034
Until I know everything
is gonna be all right.

239
00:14:37,119 --> 00:14:38,269
Brenda, stop.

240
00:14:38,757 --> 00:14:41,513
I swear, sometimes you're like eeyore.

241
00:14:42,818 --> 00:14:44,016
Check it out.

242
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:45,800
Oh, that's a good one.

243
00:14:45,950 --> 00:14:48,086
10,000 to go.

244
00:14:49,872 --> 00:14:52,201
But jason is only in
town for tonight, charese.

245
00:14:52,229 --> 00:14:53,867
You have to be there, all right?

246
00:14:54,027 --> 00:14:56,914
You have to! He just
got done with basic,

247
00:14:56,980 --> 00:15:00,008
And he's going, like, in two days!

248
00:15:00,252 --> 00:15:02,133
Then get off work.

249
00:15:02,426 --> 00:15:03,881
I'm trying!

250
00:15:04,956 --> 00:15:07,829
I'm leaving as soon as I can.
Don't get a tone with me

251
00:15:07,853 --> 00:15:10,266
When you can't even get
your butt out of pizza hut.

252
00:15:10,332 --> 00:15:13,660
Oh, hey, mr. Diaz. No, I said the 110.

253
00:15:14,022 --> 00:15:15,844
- Come on, let's go home.
- The 110 to the 710.

254
00:15:15,862 --> 00:15:17,224
Stop for a second and listen to me.

255
00:15:17,266 --> 00:15:19,590
I'm giving you the directions.
For crying out loud!

256
00:15:19,825 --> 00:15:24,947
Next new message:
Today at 2:54 p.M.

257
00:15:25,163 --> 00:15:29,092
Claire, it's Billy.
Uh, sorry about this morning.

258
00:15:29,308 --> 00:15:31,214
Give me a call.

259
00:15:34,632 --> 00:15:39,693
Next new message:
Today at 2:58 p.M.

260
00:15:40,041 --> 00:15:42,693
Claire, hey, it's me.
Are you still at Amoeba?

261
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:45,655
Because if you are, I really need
to hear some Brian Eno today,

262
00:15:45,702 --> 00:15:47,364
Or I'm going to tear my eyes out.

263
00:15:47,481 --> 00:15:49,960
Oh, shut up.

264
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:54,618
Next new message:
Today at 3:01

265
00:15:54,768 --> 00:15:57,759
Please, get a life
for one minute, please!

266
00:16:02,567 --> 00:16:05,234
Do you guys have wives
besides being gay?

267
00:16:05,834 --> 00:16:07,562
No.

268
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:11,167
We're a married couple, essentially.

269
00:16:11,229 --> 00:16:12,613
Well, when our dad married our mom,

270
00:16:12,679 --> 00:16:15,247
He was completely homosexual
in his orientation.

271
00:16:15,266 --> 00:16:16,867
Only he was in such denial about it

272
00:16:16,905 --> 00:16:20,112
Because of the social pressure, it was
like he didn't even know he was gay.

273
00:16:20,327 --> 00:16:22,089
That happens.

274
00:16:22,183 --> 00:16:24,657
Well, it wasn't until he became
a success in his chosen field

275
00:16:24,685 --> 00:16:27,793
That his ego felt, you know,
strong enough to face the truth.

276
00:16:27,953 --> 00:16:30,779
Do you ever have sex with chicks?

277
00:16:31,709 --> 00:16:34,755
- I don't.
- So, you do?

278
00:16:36,009 --> 00:16:38,220
I've had sex with a few women.

279
00:16:38,295 --> 00:16:40,633
- Have you had sex with our dad?
- You are kind of his type.

280
00:16:40,896 --> 00:16:42,878
- Do you guys have orgies?
- Okay, that's enough.

281
00:16:42,953 --> 00:16:45,535
No more talking until
we get to the salon.

282
00:16:46,957 --> 00:16:48,807
They have orgies.

283
00:16:50,211 --> 00:16:52,671
- He was waiting with that girl...
- I'm sorry.

284
00:16:52,793 --> 00:16:55,112
- ... For more than an hour!
- They were gonna be there until 4:00.

285
00:16:55,131 --> 00:16:57,864
- They left early, and she called you.
- My phone didn't ring.

286
00:16:57,901 --> 00:17:00,018
- Oh, bullshit.
- Don't pretend you don't know that shit happens.

287
00:17:00,047 --> 00:17:03,122
I don't have to pretend anything.
The way it is is bad enough.

288
00:17:03,159 --> 00:17:06,413
- If we were still together
- Oh, this wouldn't happen? Bullshit!

289
00:17:06,563 --> 00:17:08,427
- It would happen less!
- Really? What a good point.

290
00:17:08,493 --> 00:17:10,390
I know it's all my fault, vanessa.

291
00:17:10,493 --> 00:17:11,977
Whenever anything goes
wrong with the boys

292
00:17:12,005 --> 00:17:14,099
From now until the end of time
it will be because I went out

293
00:17:14,202 --> 00:17:16,916
And fucked some whore,
oka iaknow, I know, I know!

294
00:17:18,465 --> 00:17:20,812
- Look.
- What?

295
00:17:22,564 --> 00:17:25,704
You wanna hang out for a while?
You wanna stay for dinner?

296
00:17:28,897 --> 00:17:31,338
I was supposed to go to this, hum...

297
00:17:32,089 --> 00:17:33,399
But you know, I can call and change it.

298
00:17:33,436 --> 00:17:35,178
No, you're not doing me any favors.

299
00:17:35,234 --> 00:17:38,535
Oh, god, I didn't say I was
doing you any favors. Shit.

300
00:17:39,197 --> 00:17:42,488
I'm feeling pretty secure now,
But I went through a phase last year

301
00:17:42,525 --> 00:17:45,294
Where, you know,
I was so shy around chicks

302
00:17:45,295 --> 00:17:47,662
Tthat I thought maybe I was gay, too.

303
00:17:47,731 --> 00:17:50,135
I think it's pretty normal to
go through a phase like that.

304
00:17:50,511 --> 00:17:53,976
Yeah it is, but then we had
some group sessions

305
00:17:53,994 --> 00:17:56,769
With our therapists and
dad, and it turned out

306
00:17:57,060 --> 00:17:59,741
What I was really afraid
of was not being gay.

307
00:18:00,379 --> 00:18:02,628
I mean, if I wasn't gay,

308
00:18:02,675 --> 00:18:04,445
Would dad still love me?

309
00:18:04,802 --> 00:18:09,145
So, that cleared it up. I'm not gay,
and I have a girlfriend in Aspen.

310
00:18:09,192 --> 00:18:12,699
- Oh, what's her name?
- Alison. She's bi.

311
00:18:12,774 --> 00:18:15,929
Keith, does this look
completely deviant?

312
00:18:16,051 --> 00:18:18,361
No! Looks good.

313
00:18:19,271 --> 00:18:21,267
We're almost done.

314
00:18:22,342 --> 00:18:23,882
Thank you.

315
00:18:24,088 --> 00:18:26,328
My mom has a friend
back home named vernon,

316
00:18:26,450 --> 00:18:29,703
But she doesn't feel like he'd
be a good sexual partner for her.

317
00:18:29,835 --> 00:18:31,755
I have to say I kind of agree.

318
00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:34,180
You know what? I think I'm gonna
stay here and get a haircut

319
00:18:34,246 --> 00:18:36,418
while you take these two back home.

320
00:18:36,634 --> 00:18:38,737
- If that's okay.
- Sure.

321
00:18:39,023 --> 00:18:41,376
I'll come back and pick you
up after I drop the kids off.

322
00:18:41,516 --> 00:18:43,701
Thanks.

323
00:18:43,864 --> 00:18:46,671
- So how is he doing?
- Not great.

324
00:18:48,089 --> 00:18:50,437
He's been asking to go down
to the bomb shelter again.

325
00:18:51,310 --> 00:18:53,836
I don't think it's a good idea.

326
00:18:54,136 --> 00:18:55,549
I told him I would ask you.

327
00:18:55,624 --> 00:18:57,977
No, I don't want to risk
going through all that again.

328
00:18:58,728 --> 00:19:01,258
We should board that place
up and forget it's there.

329
00:19:01,512 --> 00:19:02,953
Maybe it would be good for him

330
00:19:02,972 --> 00:19:05,075
- To have somewhere
- No.

331
00:19:18,183 --> 00:19:20,127
Did u have a nice time out in the world?

332
00:19:20,343 --> 00:19:23,014
I did. It was a very
nice day, thank you.

333
00:19:28,648 --> 00:19:31,216
- Happy birthday.
- Happy birthday.

334
00:19:31,563 --> 00:19:33,211
Thanks.

335
00:19:39,258 --> 00:19:42,052
The day I turned 40 you were in europe.

336
00:19:42,136 --> 00:19:44,117
I spent the whole day
wondering if you'd call.

337
00:19:45,878 --> 00:19:47,009
Sorry.

338
00:19:47,206 --> 00:19:49,657
Don't apologize, you
did what you had to do.

339
00:19:49,967 --> 00:19:51,784
You little fucker.

340
00:19:54,361 --> 00:19:58,347
So much crazy shit has happened
Since these pictures were taken.

341
00:19:59,569 --> 00:20:01,354
So much.

342
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:04,997
The idea of
40 more years-

343
00:20:05,137 --> 00:20:08,161
Oh, but the next 40 fly by much faster.

344
00:20:08,284 --> 00:20:10,500
It will be over before you know it.

345
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:12,535
Time flies when you're having fun, huh?

346
00:20:12,591 --> 00:20:14,253
No, huh-Uh.

347
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:17,328
Time flies when you're
pretending to have fun.

348
00:20:18,657 --> 00:20:23,394
Time flies when you're pretending to love
Brenda and that baby she wants so much.

349
00:20:23,610 --> 00:20:27,319
Time flies when you're pretending to
know what people mean when they say...

350
00:20:27,807 --> 00:20:29,413
"Love."

351
00:20:31,832 --> 00:20:34,827
Let's face it, buddy boy, there's
two kinds of people in the world

352
00:20:34,866 --> 00:20:36,931
There's you and there's everybody else,

353
00:20:37,082 --> 00:20:39,420
And never the twain shall meat.

354
00:20:44,152 --> 00:20:46,814
Take it.
I got time.

355
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:54,605
- Hey.
- Hey.

356
00:20:54,699 --> 00:20:56,328
What are you doing?

357
00:20:56,403 --> 00:20:58,967
Still at work. Is everything okay?

358
00:20:59,023 --> 00:21:01,037
Yeah, everything is fine.

359
00:21:01,075 --> 00:21:03,990
- How's the baby?
- Well, I haven't lost it

360
00:21:04,010 --> 00:21:06,555
Since this morning, if
that's what you're asking.

361
00:21:06,649 --> 00:21:07,959
That's not what I meant.

362
00:21:08,062 --> 00:21:10,546
Could you stop by whole
foods on the way home

363
00:21:10,611 --> 00:21:12,480
And pick up some
chocolate silk for maya?

364
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,870
- Yeah, sure.
- And can you call me from there

365
00:21:14,888 --> 00:21:17,358
In case I've forgotten anything?

366
00:21:19,047 --> 00:21:21,882
Look, I'm not gonna come
home to some big fight, am i?

367
00:21:21,929 --> 00:21:23,253
No.

368
00:21:23,610 --> 00:21:25,042
All right.

369
00:21:25,192 --> 00:21:26,624
- Bye.
- Bye.

370
00:21:26,671 --> 00:21:28,605
<i>It's not the size of the animal that makes it deadly,</i>

371
00:21:29,155 --> 00:21:32,385
<i>It's the size of its mouth.
The bigger the mouth</i>

372
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:33,986
And then we go to the vet,

373
00:21:34,033 --> 00:21:37,550
And then back to the house,
and then all over beverly hills,

374
00:21:37,568 --> 00:21:39,878
And then finally we come here.

375
00:21:40,507 --> 00:21:43,475
It's like his job came and
found my day and ate it.

376
00:21:44,066 --> 00:21:45,761
Well, I learned
when I was a kid-

377
00:21:45,798 --> 00:21:49,567
Don't go to work with
dad, it's never fun.

378
00:21:53,258 --> 00:21:56,610
But saying no is the hardest thing
in the world.

379
00:21:57,222 --> 00:21:59,353
- At least for me.
- Me too.

380
00:22:17,605 --> 00:22:19,389
- Just wait a second.
- What's the matter?

381
00:22:19,418 --> 00:22:21,680
I don't think I should do this.

382
00:22:24,427 --> 00:22:26,493
- All right.
- I mean, you seem really nice...

383
00:22:26,643 --> 00:22:28,164
- That's not a problem.
- ... but keith and I are doing this whole

384
00:22:28,193 --> 00:22:30,963
Surrogacy thing, it's
really confusing, and hard,

385
00:22:31,019 --> 00:22:32,723
And plus I got like abducted last year

386
00:22:32,743 --> 00:22:34,658
Okay, David, you don't have to explain.

387
00:22:35,926 --> 00:22:38,114
Just stay in here a second.

388
00:22:39,198 --> 00:22:40,973
Get your shit together.

389
00:23:11,508 --> 00:23:13,865
Surprise!

390
00:23:15,452 --> 00:23:17,179
Happy birthday!

391
00:23:19,499 --> 00:23:21,340
Happy birthday.

392
00:23:21,387 --> 00:23:23,218
- Hey, thank you
- Give daddy a kiss.

393
00:23:27,056 --> 00:23:29,554
"Oh lordy, nate's
40." Is that your idea?

394
00:23:29,610 --> 00:23:31,347
This is jackie from work.

395
00:23:31,385 --> 00:23:32,967
- Oh, family dinner jackie.
- Yes.

396
00:23:33,023 --> 00:23:36,296
- Hi, nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

397
00:23:37,117 --> 00:23:39,493
So the Big Sur thing was just a ruse?

398
00:23:39,558 --> 00:23:42,826
- Why, are you disappointed?
- No no no, not at all.

399
00:23:42,962 --> 00:23:44,634
- You need a beer.
- Yeah, a beer would be great.

400
00:23:44,652 --> 00:23:46,793
Mazel tov, by the way, on the baby.

401
00:23:47,319 --> 00:23:48,972
- Oh, thank you, thank you.
- Yeah, that's great.

402
00:23:49,028 --> 00:23:50,230
- Thank you very much.
- Yeah.

403
00:23:50,352 --> 00:23:52,112
Thank you, god, for this food.

404
00:23:52,188 --> 00:23:53,572
- Amen.
- Amen.

405
00:23:55,934 --> 00:23:57,624
That's it?

406
00:23:57,656 --> 00:23:59,919
"Thank you, god, for this food. Amen"?

407
00:24:01,912 --> 00:24:03,631
Whatever happened to "bless us, o lord,

408
00:24:03,649 --> 00:24:05,529
And these thy gifts which
we are about to receive"?

409
00:24:05,575 --> 00:24:09,534
- We shortened it up. Didn't we?

410
00:24:10,775 --> 00:24:13,085
- Are we sure it's right?
- Yeah, we are.

411
00:24:14,607 --> 00:24:16,861
Want some fritos?

412
00:24:18,746 --> 00:24:20,614
Breakfast in bed.

413
00:24:23,410 --> 00:24:26,602
No, thank you, papito.
I'm good.

414
00:24:29,042 --> 00:24:30,999
Ruth, would you like a refill for that?

415
00:24:31,018 --> 00:24:32,407
Thank you very much.

416
00:24:34,293 --> 00:24:36,143
We're right in
the boondocks, okay?

417
00:24:37,063 --> 00:24:39,608
Pretty soon I saw her
turning into social events

418
00:24:39,636 --> 00:24:42,349
During the week, and
i'd be like "can I come along"?

419
00:24:42,368 --> 00:24:44,575
And she'd be like, "it's
kind of just us, todd,

420
00:24:44,596 --> 00:24:48,164
It's just the club." Next thing I know
She's fucking this guy with nut cancer.

421
00:24:48,504 --> 00:24:50,922
- Jesus!
- Yeah, she's fucking lance armstrong.

422
00:24:50,969 --> 00:24:53,438
No! She's fucking lance armstrong?!

423
00:24:53,475 --> 00:24:55,118
No no, of course not,
but in essence, yeah,

424
00:24:55,146 --> 00:24:56,526
She's fucking lance armstrong.

425
00:24:56,996 --> 00:25:00,708
Here's the keeper. This divorce is
the best thing that ever happened to me.

426
00:25:01,205 --> 00:25:04,143
I've had more ass In the last year
than I've had in my life.

427
00:25:04,172 --> 00:25:05,496
I hate you.

428
00:25:06,125 --> 00:25:08,782
Moral of the story- 40
is only the beginning.

429
00:25:09,083 --> 00:25:10,745
It's just the fucking beginning.

430
00:25:10,801 --> 00:25:12,881
- Here's how, man.
- Cheers.

431
00:25:13,961 --> 00:25:16,618
I used to mountain
bike in griffith park,

432
00:25:16,731 --> 00:25:20,726
And I saw this guy once
who had totally endo'd, you know?

433
00:25:20,777 --> 00:25:23,247
And he was laying 12
fucking feet from his bike.

434
00:25:23,313 --> 00:25:26,144
His ball sack was
completely ripped open.

435
00:25:26,294 --> 00:25:30,760
It was like, uh, two pink eggs
kind of vibrating

436
00:25:30,789 --> 00:25:32,845
In this totally shredded mess.

437
00:25:33,014 --> 00:25:34,258
It was insane.

438
00:25:34,286 --> 00:25:36,324
- Fuck.
- Jesus, billy.

439
00:25:37,479 --> 00:25:39,009
What the fuck, man?

440
00:25:39,010 --> 00:25:40,916
No, I was just thinking
about the guy with nut cancer.

441
00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:42,311
- Yeah, I got you.
- Oh, yeah.

442
00:25:42,566 --> 00:25:45,261
Happy birthday. Sorry we're late.

443
00:25:45,831 --> 00:25:47,521
He had to get a haircut.

444
00:25:47,728 --> 00:25:50,343
- What, for this?
- Yeah, that's what I thought.

445
00:25:51,258 --> 00:25:53,681
- Well, it looks good, I guess.
- Thanks.

446
00:25:54,141 --> 00:25:56,831
So how long have you two
fuckers known about this?

447
00:25:57,592 --> 00:25:58,667
Couple of weeks.

448
00:25:58,714 --> 00:26:01,681
- Yeah, what else aren't you telling me?
- Nothing.

449
00:26:02,554 --> 00:26:03,897
- What?
- I think it's cake time.

450
00:26:03,944 --> 00:26:05,432
- Hey, did you meet him, man?
- Meet who?

451
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:09,179
- Lance armstrong.
- Dude, I was speaking metaphorically.

452
00:26:09,794 --> 00:26:12,540
Oh, god, where did you
guys get this amazing cake?

453
00:26:12,578 --> 00:26:14,578
This cuban place in atwater.

454
00:26:14,672 --> 00:26:16,798
Porto's. It's in glendale.

455
00:26:17,183 --> 00:26:21,160
Light from a cake is such a great light.

456
00:26:21,531 --> 00:26:23,545
We should just live in cake light.

457
00:26:23,611 --> 00:26:26,784
Yeah, okay, here we go.

458
00:26:28,334 --> 00:26:35,258
Happy birthday to you

459
00:26:35,381 --> 00:26:39,427
Happy birthday, dear Nate

460
00:26:39,690 --> 00:26:44,367
Happy birthday to you.

461
00:26:47,029 --> 00:26:49,161
Come on, make a wish.

462
00:26:58,079 --> 00:27:00,502
Speech speech speech!

463
00:27:03,513 --> 00:27:06,086
- No.
- Aw, come on, man.

464
00:27:06,156 --> 00:27:09,067
Look, I'm sorry. Seriously,
i don't know what to say

465
00:27:09,091 --> 00:27:10,612
You know, that wouldn't sound lame.

466
00:27:10,732 --> 00:27:13,070
I have something to
say, if that's all right.

467
00:27:13,606 --> 00:27:15,056
Please.

468
00:27:16,766 --> 00:27:18,883
It is the most difcult
thing in the world

469
00:27:18,921 --> 00:27:21,582
To watch your children
grow up and move on.

470
00:27:22,212 --> 00:27:24,953
And when you left home, my firstborn,

471
00:27:24,981 --> 00:27:27,377
I was very sad. Here we go.

472
00:27:27,414 --> 00:27:29,433
This is not about you!

473
00:27:35,582 --> 00:27:38,765
These past five years with
you have been a gift, nate.

474
00:27:39,140 --> 00:27:41,746
That's all I wanted
to say. Happy birthday.

475
00:27:41,783 --> 00:27:43,333
Thank you, mom.

476
00:27:53,995 --> 00:27:57,736
Well, I can't think of
anything to say to add to that, so...

477
00:28:03,736 --> 00:28:05,168
Can I tell 'em?

478
00:28:08,483 --> 00:28:10,734
You're pregnant?

479
00:28:15,572 --> 00:28:16,821
Uh... yeah.

480
00:28:17,166 --> 00:28:18,387
Fantastic!

481
00:28:18,714 --> 00:28:21,315
- Congratulations, my man.
- Thank you.

482
00:28:21,391 --> 00:28:23,457
That's great. Congratulations.

483
00:28:24,212 --> 00:28:25,677
What the fuck?

484
00:28:25,743 --> 00:28:27,302
- Wait, where's maya?
- I've got her.

485
00:28:27,386 --> 00:28:28,940
Sounds like something fell.

486
00:28:34,062 --> 00:28:37,733
- How did it get in?
- Through the window.

487
00:28:38,090 --> 00:28:39,724
So blue.

488
00:28:39,968 --> 00:28:42,794
- It's a good omen.
- Sci-Fi channel says it's a bad omen.

489
00:28:42,841 --> 00:28:45,593
- It's not an omen. It's a bird.
- Amen.

490
00:28:45,902 --> 00:28:48,954
- No, omen, it's pronounced omen.
- Thanks.

491
00:28:49,236 --> 00:28:52,020
Birds don't usually fly at
night. It's probably sick.

492
00:28:52,086 --> 00:28:54,888
Do you think it has avian flu?

493
00:28:55,039 --> 00:28:58,452
Obviously, we don't know.
just open the window, close the door,

494
00:28:58,536 --> 00:28:59,907
And it'll find its own way out.

495
00:28:59,973 --> 00:29:02,860
But he'll poop all over everything
in the meantime.

496
00:29:02,963 --> 00:29:04,677
Well, seriously, what
kind of plan is that,

497
00:29:04,715 --> 00:29:06,884
To let a sick bird run
wild in the house pooping?

498
00:29:06,912 --> 00:29:09,926
You know what, mom? I think
george is right. I am just gonna...

499
00:29:10,048 --> 00:29:12,372
Open the window.

500
00:29:13,114 --> 00:29:15,813
I'm gonna open this door.

501
00:29:18,428 --> 00:29:20,428
Somebody close that door.

502
00:29:20,485 --> 00:29:23,475
- Hey, nate, grab the beer, okay?
- Yeah, I'll grab the beer, tom.

503
00:29:23,522 --> 00:29:25,644
- Thank you.
- It's a beautiful bird.

504
00:29:25,672 --> 00:29:27,780
God, it's fucking cerulean.

505
00:29:29,928 --> 00:29:32,435
So let's just close this door

506
00:29:32,961 --> 00:29:35,242
And see what happens.

507
00:29:39,904 --> 00:29:41,078
Jesus.

508
00:29:41,979 --> 00:29:44,242
- Thanks for letting me stay.
- Sure.

509
00:29:46,345 --> 00:29:49,017
I haven't put the
boys to bed for awhile.

510
00:29:49,716 --> 00:29:52,538
- I miss that.
- Yeah, they miss it too.

511
00:30:12,223 --> 00:30:14,200
What are you doing?

512
00:30:15,791 --> 00:30:18,063
I gotta get the fuck out of here.

513
00:30:18,889 --> 00:30:20,467
- Why?
- I just do.

514
00:30:20,570 --> 00:30:22,816
We'll cruise mulholland.
We'll go to the lookout.

515
00:30:22,853 --> 00:30:24,689
No, I don't want to go.

516
00:30:24,839 --> 00:30:27,722
It's my brother's birthday.
There's a bird in the kitchen.

517
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:30,375
Isn't being with other people
ever too much for you to deal with?

518
00:30:30,497 --> 00:30:32,492
Yeah, like right now.

519
00:30:38,365 --> 00:30:40,271
Look, there it is.

520
00:30:40,318 --> 00:30:42,900
- Shoo it out the window.
- Wait a second.

521
00:30:42,947 --> 00:30:45,853
- Don't touch it.
- David, shut up.

522
00:30:59,314 --> 00:31:01,163
Good job.

523
00:31:04,534 --> 00:31:08,055
- You're not coming?
- No, I already told you that.

524
00:31:09,764 --> 00:31:11,267
Here. You keep the car.

525
00:31:11,605 --> 00:31:14,468
- You can't walk home.
- Well, if it's too far, I'll take a cab.

526
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:17,971
Stop it! Just relax and stay, please.

527
00:31:18,130 --> 00:31:20,116
I want you to stay.

528
00:31:20,642 --> 00:31:22,506
Please.

529
00:31:30,886 --> 00:31:32,163
All right.

530
00:31:33,257 --> 00:31:36,328
- But just for a little while, okay?
- Fine.

531
00:31:36,952 --> 00:31:38,783
Fucking-
Fuck!

532
00:31:38,849 --> 00:31:40,633
Shit! God!

533
00:31:40,919 --> 00:31:42,647
Fuck! Shit!

534
00:31:43,037 --> 00:31:45,309
It's just a bird. What is your problem?

535
00:31:45,351 --> 00:31:48,900
I'm just kinda freaked out by things that
are moving around that I can't control.

536
00:31:49,911 --> 00:31:51,911
It's not a problem.

537
00:31:53,085 --> 00:31:54,944
Did you stop taking your medication?

538
00:31:56,076 --> 00:31:58,503
Yeah, but that's a good thing.

539
00:31:58,540 --> 00:32:01,484
- Why?
- Because, claire, okay,

540
00:32:01,531 --> 00:32:04,709
I'm sick of feeling like
i'm living every moment

541
00:32:04,738 --> 00:32:09,456
Inside a giant xeroxed
fucking cotton ball.

542
00:32:10,165 --> 00:32:12,094
- I gotta go outside.
- No, don't go.

543
00:32:12,132 --> 00:32:14,662
I'm just going outside. Will
you fucking listen when I talk?

544
00:32:14,681 --> 00:32:17,104
- Hey, what's going on?
- I'm just going outside.

545
00:32:17,226 --> 00:32:20,212
- Jesus christ.
- What the fuck is going on?

546
00:32:21,544 --> 00:32:22,962
Nothing. Everything is fine.

547
00:32:23,028 --> 00:32:24,737
- He didn't just hit you, did he?
- No.

548
00:32:25,084 --> 00:32:27,187
Would you please stop
being such a freak?

549
00:32:27,727 --> 00:32:30,009
By the way, the bird
is in the bedroom now.

550
00:32:30,037 --> 00:32:31,924
Yeah, well, how did the
bird get in the bedroom?

551
00:32:32,028 --> 00:32:34,422
It flew in the door. Stop fucking up.

552
00:32:34,915 --> 00:32:38,436
She used to be the wife on
that big fat husband show.

553
00:32:38,624 --> 00:32:41,422
- Which one?
- "More for me."

554
00:32:41,572 --> 00:32:43,938
Are you sure this is
the same victoria adams?

555
00:32:44,004 --> 00:32:48,032
Oh, yeah yeah, that show was
a huge hit for seven years,

556
00:32:48,061 --> 00:32:49,295
And then when they finally shut down,

557
00:32:49,323 --> 00:32:52,826
- She opened that knitting store.
- She never mentions it.

558
00:32:52,901 --> 00:32:55,971
Well, then I bet she still
does that winking thing, right?

559
00:32:56,018 --> 00:32:57,831
She does do that winking thing.

560
00:32:57,859 --> 00:33:01,140
Well, that was her
thing on the show, yeah.

561
00:33:01,990 --> 00:33:04,511
- Hey, are you okay?
- Oh, yeah.

562
00:33:04,586 --> 00:33:07,000
"Max the poet, and he's the dog."

563
00:33:07,259 --> 00:33:08,300
What are you reading?

564
00:33:08,301 --> 00:33:11,005
We are reading a book
about a dog who is also a poet.

565
00:33:11,062 --> 00:33:12,790
- Excuse me.
- You are? Great.

566
00:33:13,211 --> 00:33:16,103
Yeah, doggie doggie doggie.

567
00:33:17,182 --> 00:33:19,417
- He's a dog.
- Yep yep.

568
00:33:21,867 --> 00:33:23,420
By the way, just for the record,

569
00:33:23,458 --> 00:33:26,585
I don't know what sissy pasquese
means when she says "private,"

570
00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:29,406
But those kids of hers know
way too much about everything.

571
00:33:29,428 --> 00:33:31,653
I think it's nice they've
been given some perspective.

572
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:33,728
Yeah, in exchange for a childhood.

573
00:33:33,775 --> 00:33:36,118
Whatever we do, we're not
gonna put our kids through that.

574
00:33:36,184 --> 00:33:39,540
Parents can have a few
secrets. It's not a bad thing.

575
00:33:40,911 --> 00:33:43,803
- I'm serious.
- Fine. We'll have secrets.

576
00:33:44,198 --> 00:33:45,067
You got it.

577
00:33:45,639 --> 00:33:47,104
Okay.

578
00:33:48,250 --> 00:33:52,297
"Paris, the city of
dreams, the city of lights,

579
00:33:53,218 --> 00:33:54,908
The city of love."

580
00:34:03,754 --> 00:34:04,693
You're gonna wake the boys.

581
00:34:04,721 --> 00:34:07,273
No, they sleep through it now.

582
00:34:11,429 --> 00:34:13,034
Okay.

583
00:34:24,587 --> 00:34:26,361
Is this the line to pee?

584
00:34:32,622 --> 00:34:34,127
So the bird's in there now?

585
00:34:35,034 --> 00:34:36,843
- How'd it get in there?
- I don't know.

586
00:34:37,901 --> 00:34:40,067
What did you say to billy?
He was really upset.

587
00:34:40,133 --> 00:34:42,786
I didn't say anything to Billy.
He had some thing with Claire,

588
00:34:42,795 --> 00:34:45,560
- He got mad and he walked out.
- Well, what happened?

589
00:34:46,626 --> 00:34:48,940
You know, I don't know what happened,
Brenda. I guess what usually happens.

590
00:34:49,006 --> 00:34:50,696
- Your brother went fucking mental.
- What did you

591
00:34:51,853 --> 00:34:54,979
Hey, you might want to wait a few
seconds before you go in there.

592
00:34:56,126 --> 00:34:57,534
Thanks.

593
00:34:59,002 --> 00:35:00,256
Why did you fucking invite that guy?

594
00:35:00,312 --> 00:35:01,486
- I thought he was your friend.

595
00:35:01,505 --> 00:35:03,570
- He's not.
- You know, it really...

596
00:35:03,861 --> 00:35:04,988
Excuse me.

597
00:35:08,538 --> 00:35:11,129
I hate that you're always jumping
to conclusions about Billy.

598
00:35:11,145 --> 00:35:13,050
You will never believe
that he's getting better.

599
00:35:13,051 --> 00:35:16,089
No, I won't. I hate that he's
with Claire and in our fucking house.

600
00:35:16,122 --> 00:35:17,962
Yeah, well, at least he
knows how to keep a secret.

601
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,033
Look, I know that you told jackie,
so what's the big fucking deal?

602
00:35:21,061 --> 00:35:24,803
There is a very big difference
between me telling my supervisor,

603
00:35:24,821 --> 00:35:27,507
And you telling our entire
family, who are now looking at me

604
00:35:27,535 --> 00:35:29,751
- Wondering when I'm gonna lose this baby.
- Jesus christ!

605
00:35:29,779 --> 00:35:32,197
This morning I wasn't excited enough,
now I'm too excited.

606
00:35:32,246 --> 00:35:34,056
- What the fuck do you want ?
- No, that wasn't excitement.

607
00:35:34,105 --> 00:35:37,439
- That was macho, aggressive male bullshit.
- What the fuck is this?

608
00:35:37,551 --> 00:35:40,284
When you do stuff like that, it makes me
wonder if we should be together.

609
00:35:40,340 --> 00:35:42,040
We just got married.

610
00:35:42,087 --> 00:35:44,763
Yeah, well, if it's not
right, it's not right.

611
00:35:45,815 --> 00:35:49,890
You might want to light a
match in there. It wasn't me.

612
00:35:50,457 --> 00:35:53,481
You're freaked out right now because
you're pregnant. You see that, don't you?

613
00:35:53,528 --> 00:35:55,514
Yeah, with a baby that
you don't even want.

614
00:35:55,542 --> 00:35:57,439
- Bullshit!
- You don't respect me enough

615
00:35:57,476 --> 00:35:59,218
To wait until we know
that everything's all right

616
00:35:59,246 --> 00:36:01,378
- Before you tell the whole world.
- Shut the fuck up!

617
00:36:01,565 --> 00:36:03,565
I need to pee.

618
00:36:11,834 --> 00:36:12,944
Nate!

619
00:36:15,808 --> 00:36:18,353
Tequila shots in the kitchen.

620
00:36:21,059 --> 00:36:22,740
Get in here!

621
00:36:27,881 --> 00:36:29,862
So you stopped taking it?

622
00:36:30,397 --> 00:36:31,928
- Just like that?
- Yeah.

623
00:36:35,265 --> 00:36:36,993
And you feel...?

624
00:36:38,366 --> 00:36:40,732
I feel a little tingly.

625
00:36:41,023 --> 00:36:42,431
That's about it.

626
00:36:44,610 --> 00:36:46,291
What do they got you on these days?

627
00:36:46,375 --> 00:36:49,005
Well, they just switched
me from lithium to tofranil,

628
00:36:49,192 --> 00:36:52,145
In between the shock treatments.

629
00:36:54,023 --> 00:36:56,089
What are those like?

630
00:36:57,178 --> 00:37:00,206
Honestly... I don't know.

631
00:37:02,235 --> 00:37:05,784
I go in. They put me on a
bed. Ey give me some oxygen.

632
00:37:05,990 --> 00:37:09,807
They say, "you're gonna feel a little prick
in your hand." That always makes me laugh.

633
00:37:10,122 --> 00:37:12,225
And then the next thing I know I wake up
with the worst headache

634
00:37:12,244 --> 00:37:14,526
I've ever had in my life.

635
00:37:18,469 --> 00:37:20,328
Do you think it's helping?

636
00:37:22,049 --> 00:37:26,274
I think that...
As émile coué used to say,

637
00:37:26,885 --> 00:37:31,110
"Every day in every way, i
am getting better and better."

638
00:37:33,255 --> 00:37:35,683
But not everyone agrees.

639
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:38,651
Yeah, it's hard to
get your shit together

640
00:37:38,679 --> 00:37:40,520
With someone watching all the time.

641
00:37:40,567 --> 00:37:41,937
Yeah, it is.

642
00:37:42,473 --> 00:37:44,984
But when no one's watching,
then where are you?

643
00:37:46,341 --> 00:37:48,172
Where the fuck are you then?

644
00:37:55,064 --> 00:37:57,919
Daddy sang bass

645
00:37:59,464 --> 00:38:01,511
Mama sang tenor

646
00:38:02,037 --> 00:38:05,417
Me and little brother
would join right in there

647
00:38:06,104 --> 00:38:11,061
Singin' seemed to
help a troubled soul...

648
00:38:18,275 --> 00:38:20,041
I'm gonna take off.

649
00:38:21,187 --> 00:38:23,290
Why don't you give these to claire?

650
00:38:23,467 --> 00:38:25,608
- Yeah, sure.
- Thanks.

651
00:38:25,909 --> 00:38:27,289
Happy birthday.

652
00:38:46,690 --> 00:38:48,022
"Louie's wearing the green hat."

653
00:38:46,690 --> 00:38:48,022
- Who's that?
- Louis.

654
00:38:48,042 --> 00:38:49,791
Louis. That's right.

655
00:38:51,862 --> 00:38:53,517
- Hey.
- Hey.

656
00:38:55,374 --> 00:38:57,570
You must be looking
forward to this routine.

657
00:38:57,816 --> 00:39:00,517
Yeah, I think it's gonna be wonderful.

658
00:39:00,634 --> 00:39:02,548
Oh, come on.

659
00:39:03,233 --> 00:39:05,276
Who's got on the blue coat?

660
00:39:07,413 --> 00:39:09,703
- Who's that?
- Bear.

661
00:39:09,844 --> 00:39:12,515
- The bear, the bear.
- The bear.

662
00:39:16,713 --> 00:39:18,509
For so many years,

663
00:39:18,674 --> 00:39:21,457
David was always the one saying,
"Come on, let's have kids."

664
00:39:21,727 --> 00:39:24,046
And I was the one on the fence,

665
00:39:24,184 --> 00:39:26,157
But now that it's actually gonna happen,

666
00:39:26,239 --> 00:39:28,317
I'm finally realizing that

667
00:39:28,329 --> 00:39:30,360
I'm gonna be disappointed
if it doesn't work out.

668
00:39:30,372 --> 00:39:32,715
Oh, it'll work out.

669
00:39:32,891 --> 00:39:35,938
It's like I'm already missing this
kid that we don't even have yet.

670
00:39:36,924 --> 00:39:38,838
I mean, don't get me
wrong, david's excited too.

671
00:39:38,885 --> 00:39:41,198
Oh, yeah, you know, Nate too.

672
00:39:41,844 --> 00:39:43,998
It's a team effort.

673
00:39:47,051 --> 00:39:49,980
- I'll let you guys have your moment.
- Say "good night, uncle Keith."

674
00:39:50,215 --> 00:39:52,751
- Good night, uncle keith.
- Good night.

675
00:39:54,106 --> 00:39:56,000
Are you sleepy, little one?

676
00:39:56,081 --> 00:39:58,633
- Could you turn the light off?
- Oh, yeah, sure.

677
00:39:58,634 --> 00:40:01,012
And close the door, thanks.

678
00:40:01,041 --> 00:40:03,786
Okay, little one, I think
that's enough for tonight.

679
00:40:06,670 --> 00:40:08,431
Raspberry.

680
00:40:10,092 --> 00:40:12,487
Everything tastes like beer right now.

681
00:40:16,309 --> 00:40:17,636
- Hey.
- Hey.

682
00:40:17,648 --> 00:40:18,869
Hey.

683
00:40:19,515 --> 00:40:21,619
George told me

684
00:40:21,842 --> 00:40:24,343
That billy told him to
tell you to give you these.

685
00:40:24,367 --> 00:40:26,034
Billy left?

686
00:40:26,057 --> 00:40:28,183
That's what george said.

687
00:40:30,766 --> 00:40:33,161
- I'm sorry. You want some cake?
- No.

688
00:40:34,233 --> 00:40:36,166
- Come on, have some.
- Hey, dude, leave her alone.

689
00:40:36,167 --> 00:40:38,222
I can take care of myself, thanks.

690
00:40:40,346 --> 00:40:41,946
Looks like it's cake time.

691
00:40:42,019 --> 00:40:45,072
- I've been saving up for this.
- Oh, good.

692
00:40:48,376 --> 00:40:51,009
Fuck. All right, fine,
i'll have a piece.

693
00:40:51,268 --> 00:40:54,182
Here you go.

694
00:41:10,671 --> 00:41:12,453
I'm in here.

695
00:41:12,521 --> 00:41:13,801
- Hey.
- Sorry.

696
00:41:14,388 --> 00:41:16,995
No, that's okay. It's cool.

697
00:41:18,470 --> 00:41:20,577
I just needed a moment.

698
00:41:20,654 --> 00:41:22,611
Yeah, me, too.

699
00:41:24,333 --> 00:41:26,856
- Is it gone ?
- Yeah

700
00:41:26,981 --> 00:41:29,177
Finally.

701
00:41:29,191 --> 00:41:31,007
You know, mom and george, they left.

702
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:33,236
I'm getting a ride from Keith and David.

703
00:41:33,275 --> 00:41:35,066
Oh.

704
00:41:36,934 --> 00:41:38,901
- Tequila?
- Sure.

705
00:41:45,655 --> 00:41:47,620
Thanks.

706
00:41:54,626 --> 00:41:58,623
"Para riva, para bajo,
para centro, para dentro."

707
00:42:02,614 --> 00:42:04,675
Impressive.

708
00:42:04,694 --> 00:42:07,309
Yeah, many years in
arizona, much tequila.

709
00:42:07,863 --> 00:42:09,442
Oh.

710
00:42:12,346 --> 00:42:14,927
Good birthday?

711
00:42:15,023 --> 00:42:17,465
Yeah, it's okay.

712
00:42:20,402 --> 00:42:22,309
Feel like all I can
get out of this birthday

713
00:42:22,348 --> 00:42:24,929
Is that life is really fucking lonely.

714
00:42:27,052 --> 00:42:29,556
You have this wonderful family

715
00:42:30,693 --> 00:42:33,197
- And a baby on the way.
- I know.

716
00:42:35,826 --> 00:42:38,157
And it's really fucking lonely.

717
00:42:43,001 --> 00:42:45,216
I just feel like all I do all day long

718
00:42:45,269 --> 00:42:47,580
Is manage myself,

719
00:42:47,922 --> 00:42:50,677
Try to fucking connect with people.

720
00:42:52,964 --> 00:42:55,059
But it's like no matter how much energy

721
00:42:55,097 --> 00:42:57,423
You pour into,

722
00:42:57,808 --> 00:43:00,409
getting to the station on time
Or getting on the right train,

723
00:43:00,519 --> 00:43:03,929
There's still no fucking guarantee
that anybody's gonna be there for you

724
00:43:05,807 --> 00:43:08,137
To pick you up when you get there.

725
00:43:11,157 --> 00:43:13,064
You know what I mean?

726
00:43:15,096 --> 00:43:16,637
Well, I know that

727
00:43:16,685 --> 00:43:18,418
if you think life's a vending machine,

728
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:21,341
Where you put in virtue

729
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:23,749
And you get out happiness,

730
00:43:23,783 --> 00:43:26,575
Then you're probably
gonna be disappointed.

731
00:43:28,728 --> 00:43:30,957
I know that.

732
00:43:36,303 --> 00:43:39,442
- Is that how I sound?
- A little.

733
00:43:46,588 --> 00:43:49,473
Nate! Nate! Get in here!

734
00:43:49,974 --> 00:43:52,478
- Fuck!
- I don't think believe it.

735
00:43:53,132 --> 00:43:55,516
Oh my god!

736
00:43:56,320 --> 00:43:59,248
- Well, how the fuck did it get in again?
- Through the window.

737
00:43:59,301 --> 00:44:01,189
- Yeah, why was the window open?

738
00:44:01,228 --> 00:44:04,256
'Cause you said it was in the
bedroom. Don't be such a jerk.

739
00:44:04,983 --> 00:44:06,544
Fuck off.

740
00:44:06,556 --> 00:44:09,809
I have to do every
littlefucking thing myself.

741
00:44:13,361 --> 00:44:16,504
I have tried all night long
To do the right thing by this bird,

742
00:44:16,614 --> 00:44:19,321
But it just keeps fucking with me.

743
00:44:19,325 --> 00:44:22,190
- Try not to take it personally.
- Shut up, David.

744
00:44:22,415 --> 00:44:24,324
Nate!

745
00:44:25,597 --> 00:44:27,100
Get out!

746
00:44:27,530 --> 00:44:29,011
Jesus christ, chill.

747
00:44:32,271 --> 00:44:36,138
Get the motherfuck out!

748
00:44:36,906 --> 00:44:40,818
How many times do I have
to fucking apologize?

749
00:44:41,005 --> 00:44:43,215
Sorry.

750
00:44:43,900 --> 00:44:46,679
I'm so sorry that I'm putting
you through all of this.

751
00:44:46,829 --> 00:44:49,458
- It's not your fault. I know that.
- No, you don't.

752
00:44:49,547 --> 00:44:52,657
You say that you do, but I can
tell by the way you look at me,

753
00:44:52,989 --> 00:44:55,840
You think that all of this is my fault.

754
00:44:57,287 --> 00:45:00,337
You don't wanna make love to
me. You don't wanna kiss me.

755
00:45:00,309 --> 00:45:02,475
- You don't wanna be in the same room with me!
- That's not true.

756
00:45:02,519 --> 00:45:05,740
Oh, yes, it is!

757
00:45:06,022 --> 00:45:08,917
Ruth... Don't you understand?

758
00:45:10,436 --> 00:45:14,001
Nobody grows up thinking this is
the way they're gonna turn out to be.

759
00:45:14,541 --> 00:45:17,807
If I could change just
by snapping my fingers,

760
00:45:18,243 --> 00:45:20,807
- I'd do it.
- I know you would, George.

761
00:45:20,873 --> 00:45:23,326
I am trying...

762
00:45:23,845 --> 00:45:26,497
So hard to get better.

763
00:45:26,490 --> 00:45:29,722
- And you are.
- But not fast enough for you!

764
00:45:29,888 --> 00:45:33,389
You're getting better as
fast as you can. I know that.

765
00:45:34,384 --> 00:45:37,146
I am so lucky.

766
00:45:37,195 --> 00:45:39,874
I hate that I'm the lucky one.

767
00:45:43,314 --> 00:45:46,076
No one's ever lucky to have me.

768
00:45:48,638 --> 00:45:52,395
Nobody's ever been lucky to have me.

769
00:46:24,034 --> 00:46:27,022
It's good, right?

770
00:46:48,744 --> 00:46:50,747
Rico, wake up.

771
00:46:50,471 --> 00:46:54,034
Baby, hurry up. You
gotta get out of here.

772
00:46:54,856 --> 00:46:56,541
Why?

773
00:46:56,755 --> 00:46:59,960
I don't want the boys to
see you. It'll confuse them.

774
00:47:01,803 --> 00:47:03,820
Oh.

775
00:47:07,342 --> 00:47:09,939
All right.

776
00:47:11,847 --> 00:47:14,466
<i>I know there's beautiful snow there
- No, that's great.</i>

777
00:47:14,543 --> 00:47:16,681
I just, you know...

778
00:47:16,912 --> 00:47:18,434
Thank you.

779
00:47:19,142 --> 00:47:21,357
Okay, bye.

780
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:23,167
Who was that?

781
00:47:23,201 --> 00:47:26,205
- Roger.
- What did he want?

782
00:47:26,755 --> 00:47:28,912
It turns out sissy was the board chair

783
00:47:28,867 --> 00:47:31,965
- Of an adoption agency once.
- Yeah...

784
00:47:32,273 --> 00:47:35,339
She called in a favor, and she
said we could adopt through them,

785
00:47:35,553 --> 00:47:39,062
- If we still wanted to.
- We kind of made a commitment to mary.

786
00:47:39,524 --> 00:47:42,618
I know, but we don't know for sure
that that's really going to work out.

787
00:47:42,722 --> 00:47:46,534
We always said we'd pursue both options
Until it made sense to stop, right?

788
00:47:47,411 --> 00:47:50,257
Yeah, I guess so.

789
00:47:51,741 --> 00:47:54,911
So now roger's your hero?

790
00:47:55,105 --> 00:47:58,309
A little.

791
00:48:01,638 --> 00:48:05,367
So you got like almost no
haircut yesterday, right?

792
00:48:06,106 --> 00:48:09,476
He just took a little off the top.

793
00:48:20,360 --> 00:48:23,034
Where have you been?

794
00:48:26,810 --> 00:48:29,904
Nowhere. I stayed at my house.

795
00:48:31,962 --> 00:48:35,100
You fucked somebody.

796
00:48:35,581 --> 00:48:38,261
It's okay.

797
00:48:39,020 --> 00:48:41,368
I'm not mad.

798
00:48:41,479 --> 00:48:42,888
Just tell me who it was.

799
00:48:42,943 --> 00:48:45,484
Was it that divorced guy?

800
00:48:46,306 --> 00:48:49,511
- Billy, come on.
- I forgive you, Claire.

801
00:48:50,194 --> 00:48:53,040
You can just admit it.

802
00:48:54,027 --> 00:48:56,790
Just- Just be
honest with me.

803
00:49:00,899 --> 00:49:03,734
Yeah, it was him.

804
00:49:06,023 --> 00:49:07,708
Okay.

805
00:49:17,239 --> 00:49:19,034
Will you fuck me now?

806
00:49:19,089 --> 00:49:20,867
- Please.
- No.

807
00:49:20,940 --> 00:49:23,199
- You know I forgive you, claire, hmm?
- No.

808
00:49:23,254 --> 00:49:25,740
It's okay.

809
00:49:25,788 --> 00:49:27,197
Just fuck me now.

810
00:49:28,142 --> 00:49:30,512
- Come on, take off your pants.
- No!

811
00:49:30,809 --> 00:49:33,792
- Please? Come on.
- Get the fuck away from me!

812
00:49:33,868 --> 00:49:35,526
But I forgive you.

813
00:49:38,613 --> 00:49:41,596
- Come on, I need to be inside you.
- No!

814
00:50:07,425 --> 00:50:09,110
I'm sorry.
