1
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:45,320
You Never Know

2
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:22,320
Hello?

3
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:25,950
{\i1}- Hi, may I speak with Joe Marti, please? {\i0}
- Speaking.

4
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:27,820
{\i1}Joe, glad I caught ya!

5
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:29,120
Is this a sales call?

6
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:33,170
{\i1}I just wanted to let you know that a representative from Ameritech Vinyl Windows will be in your area…

7
00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:37,370
- I’m not interested.
{\i1}- There’s absolutely no obligation to buy anything…

8
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:39,070
Look.
I said no.

9
00:02:39,070 --> 00:02:43,070
{\i1}- For a limited time, we’re offering interest- free…. {\i0}
- Hey, goodbye, asshole!

10
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:45,590
{\i1}Fuck, he’s got a gun!

11
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:49,180
Get down!

12
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:53,270
Hey, remember me?

13
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:12,290
Daniel, what the hell
Oh my God!

14
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:15,020
Daniel, please! No, please!

15
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:16,620
Fuck you!

16
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,630
Oh, my God!

17
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:51,670
Hello? Hello?

18
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:29,980
- This is okay?
- Yeah

19
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:32,900
You sure you’re comfortable?

20
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:35,700
Aren’t you? Do you want to get on top?

21
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:38,590
Well, I don’t have to. You want me to?

22
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:40,890
If you want to. But I’m fine like this.

23
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:47,250
Maya’s right there.

24
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:50,080
She’s not looking.
I know, but…

25
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,480
{\i1}Hi, this is Lisa…
And Nate…

26
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:55,580
{\i1}And Maya…C’mon, sweetie.

27
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:58,280
{\i1}And we’re the Fisher family. Leave a message.

28
00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:03,030
{\i1}Hi, Lisa, it’s Carol. Please pick up if you’re there.

29
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:08,240
{\i1}I don’t know where else you could be. Both your cars are in my driveway.

30
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,580
{\i1}Listen, I need muffins.

31
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:17,370
Corn muffins. I had an intense craving for miniature corn muffins.

32
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:22,010
Please! This is my one hour a day to eat carbs.

33
00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:23,910
Shut up!

34
00:05:24,890 --> 00:05:26,590
{\i1}Stop ignoring me!

35
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:29,190
Don’t make her the muffins! Don’t make her the muffins!

36
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:30,490
{\i1}Hello!!!

37
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:36,230
The flowers that bloom in the spring, tra- la, we promise a merry sunshine

38
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:38,970
As we merrily dance and we sing, tra- la

39
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:41,470
We welcome the hope that they bring, tra- la

40
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:46,170
Of a summer of roses and wine,
Of a summer of roses and wine!

41
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:47,420
That’s great.

42
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:49,990
And that’s what we mean when we say that a thing

43
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:53,690
Is welcome as flowers that bloom in the spring.
- David...

44
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:59,470
David. It’s a little early.

45
00:05:59,670 --> 00:06:01,570
Sorry. I just want to make sure I get it right.

46
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:03,770
Some of the guys in this chorus are so good.

47
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:06,770
One of them even recorded with Chanticleer.
You sound great

48
00:06:07,390 --> 00:06:09,790
I even dreamed about singing last night.

49
00:06:09,790 --> 00:06:11,790
You weren’t just dreaming.

50
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:16,780
- Oh, God, punch me next time!
- I did

51
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:20,670
What happened to your uniform?

52
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:23,370
I tore it getting a Frisbee out of a tree.

53
00:06:23,370 --> 00:06:26,070
- Why were you..
- That’s what security guards do, David.

54
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:28,070
We help people.

55
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:32,480
I’m leaving.

56
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:35,780
Do you think you’d like Beef Blast Pizza Rolls?

57
00:06:36,490 --> 00:06:38,390
Um, I doubt it.

58
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:42,490
Me neither. But with a double coupon, it’s practically free.

59
00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:44,490
Maybe the boys will like them.

60
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:47,180
I might not be home tonight.

61
00:06:47,690 --> 00:06:49,690
Take a sweater.

62
00:06:50,530 --> 00:06:54,050
{\i1}You’ve reached the Fisher Family. Please leave a message.

63
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:58,310
{\i1}Ruth, are you there? It’s Sarah.

64
00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:03,330
{\i1}I’m just checking in on you. I know what a drag it is when you’re out of work.

65
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:07,030
{\i1}Thought you might want to come up to Topanga for the day.

66
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:10,490
{\i1} I could make some of Aunt May’s German potato salad.

67
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:14,090
{\i1}I know you like that. Call me. Bye!

68
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:17,800
You liked her potato salad. I hated it.

69
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:33,980
It just never occurs to you that a madman will walk into your husband’s office

70
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:37,780
and suddenly…
he’s gone.

71
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:40,620
No, of course not.

72
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:45,060
And then there’s telling the children.

73
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:50,060
We have 2 girls, 12 and 16.

74
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:53,960
What should I say to them?

75
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:56,360
To make them feel better?

76
00:07:57,460 --> 00:07:58,960
What?

77
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:04,040
Well, uh…you, you could.

78
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:08,350
Hello.

79
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:12,550
Glad you could make it. Nate, this is Dorothy Milne.

80
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:14,150
Nate Fisher.

81
00:08:14,450 --> 00:08:16,150
That’s my partner.

82
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:19,200
I am very sorry about your husband.

83
00:08:22,170 --> 00:08:24,270
I know these are just words,

84
00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:28,850
but we’ll work together with you to give him a fitting tribute.

85
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:32,220
Thank you!

86
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:35,320
Everything’s already been taken care of.

87
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,680
We’re done.

88
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:39,680
Good.

89
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:42,460
Now, let me walk you to your car.

90
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:56,070
I didn’t even go to my prom.

91
00:08:56,190 --> 00:08:58,790
If somebody asked me, I probably would’ve freaked out.

92
00:08:58,790 --> 00:09:02,290
I took Nancy Pollard. She smelled like fried chicken.

93
00:09:02,290 --> 00:09:05,390
- Why?
- I don’t know. She just did.

94
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:12,880
I got a bottle of champagne with my friend, Parker,

95
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:16,380
and we climbed the fence to school, and we just sat in the quad,

96
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:19,980
and got drunk, and said good fucking bye to high school.

97
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:21,480
Nice!

98
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:25,280
- Then we both totally started crying.
- Why

99
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:29,140
I don’t know.

100
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:33,680
I don’t know. I guess we were like saying goodbye to our childhood, or whatever.

101
00:09:35,290 --> 00:09:37,290
It just seemed sad.

102
00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:41,970
Yeah?

103
00:09:41,970 --> 00:09:44,570
I mean, I hated fucking high school,

104
00:09:44,570 --> 00:09:48,470
but still, it was my life.

105
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:51,640
And it was all I knew, and it was just over.

106
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:57,900
God, could I be more pathetic?

107
00:09:57,900 --> 00:10:00,200
You’re not pathetic.

108
00:10:00,650 --> 00:10:02,450
You’re just sensitive.

109
00:10:02,450 --> 00:10:04,750
I know. I’m too sensitive.

110
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:07,850
No, you’re perfect.

111
00:10:11,230 --> 00:10:13,300
What time do you have to get up?

112
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:18,860
Oh, fuck, I have to get up in like 3 hours,

113
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:21,360
and I haven’t even done the assignment yet.

114
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,900
- You keep distracting me.
- I keep distracting you?

115
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:27,900
Yeah, my hands are like magnetically drawn to your dick!

116
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:30,420
What is the assignment?

117
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:35,820
I have to read and critique some theoretical conceptual bullshit.

118
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:40,740
They make you take all the boring classes with theory before they let you do anything cool with clay.

119
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:42,640
I know exactly how you feel.

120
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:45,540
- No, you don’t.
- That’s why I dropped out of music school.

121
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:47,940
All I wanted to do was write great music,

122
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:52,840
but they had me studying all this shit that had nothing to do with anything.

123
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:57,940
They try to program your mind so you’re exactly like everybody else.

124
00:10:57,940 --> 00:11:00,140
Don’t let them do that to you.

125
00:11:00,810 --> 00:11:02,810
You’re too talented.

126
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:05,840
Do you think so?

127
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,540
What?

128
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:12,690
You think I like you just ‘cause you have the softest skin I’ve ever felt?

129
00:11:12,690 --> 00:11:14,690
I don’t know.

130
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:17,140
You’re amazing, Claire.

131
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:27,860
- Hello, beautiful ladies.
- Good morning.

132
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:30,260
Thank you for letting me sleep in.

133
00:11:31,510 --> 00:11:33,310
Does your brother like eggplant?

134
00:11:33,310 --> 00:11:36,710
Um, I don’t know. I guess.

135
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:41,320
I figured we could grill some salmon tonight. I just don’t know what else.

136
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:43,220
Oh, is that tonight?

137
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:45,220
- Yes.
- Can we cancel?

138
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:48,030
- It was your idea!
- I know..

139
00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:50,390
and it sounded good at the time, but...

140
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:55,390
...I see David at work every day, and it’s not like I’m looking to spend some quality time with Keith.

141
00:11:55,390 --> 00:11:57,390
You wanted David to see Maya!

142
00:11:58,730 --> 00:12:00,730
Okay, you’re right. We’ll do it

143
00:12:01,810 --> 00:12:04,910
Hey, your uncle David’s coming over. Won’t that be fun? Huh?

144
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:08,710
Yeah, yeah! I’ll try once more.

145
00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:11,510
Please?

146
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:15,070
I’ll try once more.

147
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:18,300
Great!

148
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:20,300
Lisa, you’re being careful, right?

149
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:22,300
I’m being very delicate.

150
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:24,300
Hey, Maya.

151
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:33,170
- Honey, I think you’re going too deep.
- Nate, you worry too much.

152
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,870
Just because you deal with people dying every day…

153
00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:38,470
Look, I’ve noticed that sometimes after you clean her ears,

154
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:40,770
- she doesn’t respond as quickly.
- So you think I’ve injured her?

155
00:12:40,770 --> 00:12:42,570
Of course not. I’m just saying that…

156
00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:45,070
maybe there’s some ringing in her ears after you’ve cleaned them.

157
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:48,570
Nate! I know whether my child can hear or not! She can hear!

158
00:12:48,570 --> 00:12:50,270
She’s been tested, and she can hear!

159
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:53,400
- Right, your child.
- I didn’t mean—

160
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:56,400
Look, I know I’m just the father but I’m every bit as committed to her as you are.

161
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,600
- Nate—
- I’m just trying to help.

162
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,600
I gotta get to work.

163
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:11,330
{\i1}You’ve reached the Fisher family. Please leave a message.

164
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:14,560
{\i1}Ruth, it’s Sarah.

165
00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:18,270
{\i1}I’m disappointed you didn’t call back

166
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:21,270
{\i1}Look, I’ll be honest. I was trying to trick you into coming out here.

167
00:13:22,130 --> 00:13:26,730
{\i1}I need you. I hurt my back and I’m all alone—

168
00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:28,730
What did you do?

169
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:31,910
I fell off a ladder.

170
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:33,810
{\i1}Have you seen a doctor?

171
00:13:34,510 --> 00:13:39,410
He told me to stay in bed, and he gave me a prescription for Vicadin.

172
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:41,880
What do you need me to do?

173
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:43,880
{\i1}Pick it up for me?

174
00:13:44,450 --> 00:13:46,440
Give me the address of the pharmacy.

175
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:50,340
{\i1}Oh, Ruth, {\i0}I knew I could count on you!

176
00:13:57,310 --> 00:13:59,310
Are you doing this with me?

177
00:13:59,310 --> 00:14:01,310
Yes.

178
00:14:01,310 --> 00:14:03,310
I can do it myself, David.

179
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:09,240
Well, I’m sure that’s true, but Nate and I have found it’s helpful to have two people in there.

180
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:11,240
Why? So one of you can sleep late?

181
00:14:14,690 --> 00:14:18,130
And, of course, we’ll place an obituary notice in the paper.

182
00:14:18,430 --> 00:14:25,730
No, we’d like to keep this private, and as simple as possible.

183
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:30,680
You see this kind of thing on TV, and you think,

184
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:33,880
oh my God, those poor people…

185
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:37,060
but now it’s happening to us,

186
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:44,160
and we have to see it every time we turn it on…

187
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:50,520
Thank you.

188
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:57,560
We knew that Daniel was a troubled boy, but we really thought he was getting better.

189
00:14:58,580 --> 00:15:01,880
Your son…isn’t the one who did the shooting?

190
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:05,680
- Yes.
- I’m sorry. We can’t possibly…

191
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:08,880
…imagine what you must be going through.

192
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:15,120
But you can rest assured, we will do everything we can help you through this dark time.

193
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:18,280
Thank you.

194
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:24,100
Fisher and Sons has never turned down a funeral, and neither will Fisher and Diaz.

195
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:29,100
Oh, that’s great, so when Dorothy Milne is crying over her husband’s casket,

196
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:32,600
I’ll be sure to tell her that you’re in the next room arranging flowers around the fucking man who killed him.

197
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:36,500
The services will be held on different days. There will be no conflict.

198
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:40,400
Oh, come on, man, I know you like to make a buck, but isn’t this going a little far?

199
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:42,400
That’s got nothing to do with it

200
00:15:43,090 --> 00:15:45,380
The funeral isn’t for the deceased, it’s for the living.

201
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:48,580
Oh, really? Yeah, I read the same book as you.

202
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:54,100
Do you think Mr. and Mrs. Showalter are in any less pain than Dorothy Milne?

203
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:55,860
Maybe I don’t give a shit

204
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:59,360
Maybe if they did a better job in raising their kid he wouldn’t have killed all those people.

205
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:02,660
- Rico, you can’t blame them.
- Yes, I can blame them. And I do.

206
00:16:08,330 --> 00:16:13,090
Well, whether you like it or not, this is your job. You’re gonna have to put your feelings aside.

207
00:16:13,090 --> 00:16:15,490
Now, I need you to go to the morgue and pick up his body.

208
00:16:15,490 --> 00:16:18,990
Fuck you, you pick it up! I’ve got nothing to do with this.

209
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:46,010
Hello, I’m Ruth, Sarah’s sister.

210
00:16:46,010 --> 00:16:49,810
Well, too bad you didn’t get here five minutes ago. You could’ve cleaned up her puke.

211
00:16:49,810 --> 00:16:53,310
Oh, I’m Bettina. Come on in.

212
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:57,440
Sarah, your sister’s here!

213
00:17:07,410 --> 00:17:09,910
My goodness, you look awful!

214
00:17:11,010 --> 00:17:13,810
Bettina, can we have a moment alone?

215
00:17:13,810 --> 00:17:15,110
Why?

216
00:17:15,110 --> 00:17:18,610
Because she’s my sister and we need to talk.

217
00:17:18,610 --> 00:17:20,710
- What’s in the bag?
- It’s just the—

218
00:17:20,710 --> 00:17:27,110
Just some, some some things I asked her to bring for me…the...lip balm, hair clips, strawberries.

219
00:17:27,110 --> 00:17:29,110
- Well, no…
- Fork it over.

220
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:33,610
Ruth, help me, I’m being held hostage.

221
00:17:33,610 --> 00:17:36,710
Shut your yappy mouth, or I’ll goddamn tape it shut!

222
00:17:36,810 --> 00:17:39,810
- Goodness, what’s going on?
- Ruth, please!

223
00:17:39,810 --> 00:17:43,710
Do I have to carry you back to the bed, or you gonna walk by yourself?

224
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:51,310
Bitch.

225
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:55,520
Give me the bag.

226
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:57,820
It’s her Vicodin. She has a prescription.

227
00:17:57,820 --> 00:18:03,020
Of course she does! She has Vicodin prescriptions at half the pharmacies in LA!

228
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:08,740
Your sister’s into her second day of withdrawal.

229
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:12,540
She begged me to make sure she got through it NO MATTER WHAT!

230
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:14,540
Fuck that, I was high!

231
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:21,330
{\i1}I'm sorry, Keith, I’m having problems at the morgue.

232
00:18:21,330 --> 00:18:22,900
Why didn’t you call me before?

233
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:26,300
{\i1}Because I didn’t know this was going to take so long. I’m sorry.

234
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:30,200
Fine, whatever. I’ll see you tonight

235
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:35,060
Can’t make it. Sorry for wasting your time.

236
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:37,960
You don’t need to leave. You and I can talk.

237
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:44,960
- We can do that?
- Sure, why not?

238
00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:57,290
Tell me about that phone call. How did it make you feel?

239
00:18:58,140 --> 00:19:00,140
Pissed off.

240
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:05,040
But I’m working on my anger management technique. I’m taking a lot of deep breaths.

241
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:07,040
That’s good.

242
00:19:07,310 --> 00:19:10,240
Have you been feeling a lot of anger towards David lately?

243
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:14,340
I’ve been giving myself so many damn time- outs I haven’t been feeling too much of anything. Just numb.

244
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:17,540
Maybe this is a good time to let some of that anger out.

245
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:20,600
I’m fine.

246
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:24,010
Pretend David’s sitting right there next to you.

247
00:19:24,010 --> 00:19:26,210
What do you want to say to him?

248
00:19:27,210 --> 00:19:29,210
Anything that comes to mind.

249
00:19:33,910 --> 00:19:38,410
Relax. Stop trying so hard. You’re making me nervous.

250
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:43,800
What other things would you like to tell him that you don’t like about him?

251
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:53,360
I hate your stupid little buckwheat pillow.

252
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:56,360
And I hate your nose spray!

253
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:58,960
And I hate the way you eat! You take little bitty bites,

254
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:03,060
and then you put your fork down after every little bite like you’re some fucking prince!

255
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:06,160
I hate the way you always want to fall asleep with your head on my shoulder!

256
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:08,160
Your head is heavy!

257
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:13,760
I hate the way you always make me feel like I’m my father by letting me walk all over you!

258
00:20:18,330 --> 00:20:20,420
What?

259
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:26,640
Y’know, I always thought by being gay, I’d avoid fucking my mother, but I guess that’s not the case.

260
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:32,700
Have you thought about seeing a therapist on your own?

261
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:43,110
Wow, this is great.

262
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:45,010
It’s my polenta. You like it?

263
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:47,010
- It’s delicious.
- Thank you

264
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:54,160
- Hello.
{\i1}- Hi, it’s Carol.

265
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:58,680
- Hello?
{\i1}- Lisa

266
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:02,780
I’m at Mark Harmon and Pam Dawber’s place in the mountains. Listen, their cook knows nothing!

267
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:04,880
I need you to walk them through your basil vinaigrette.

268
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,580
{\i1}Right now?

269
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:08,580
Yes, the salad’s waiting!

270
00:21:10,110 --> 00:21:12,330
What?

271
00:21:12,530 --> 00:21:15,630
- I’ve got to deal with this.
- Okay, go ahead. I’ll start the grill.

272
00:21:15,630 --> 00:21:18,130
- I’ve still got a load of laundry to do.
- I’ll do it. Go.

273
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:25,420
- I’m sorry about this morning.
- Oh, God, me too!

274
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:26,620
{\i1}Are you still there?

275
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:29,020
I just worry about Maya. I get so scared something’s gonna go wrong.

276
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:31,420
Nothing’s gonna go wrong.
{\i1}- Salad dressing!

277
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:33,920
I know. Maya has the best mom in the world.

278
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:35,920
{\i1}Hello!

279
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:38,580
{\i1}I NEED dressing!

280
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:42,080
I mean, Gabe was definitely exciting,

281
00:21:42,590 --> 00:21:44,590
in kind of a sick way,

282
00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:48,230
but…I think Phil’s like the only guy who’s ever really understood me.

283
00:21:48,230 --> 00:21:52,530
That’s cool. Not even my imaginary friends understand me.

284
00:21:52,730 --> 00:21:55,230
Or maybe they do. They just don’t like me.

285
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:57,230
I think you need better imaginary friends.

286
00:21:57,230 --> 00:21:59,930
No. I think they’re the best I can do.

287
00:21:59,930 --> 00:22:02,630
So what do you really like about this guy?

288
00:22:04,430 --> 00:22:07,530
I don’t know. He’s sweet.

289
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,160
- He’s hot.
- Nice

290
00:22:10,510 --> 00:22:13,310
- He’s got his own band.
- It’s Keanu Reeves, isn’t it?

291
00:22:13,310 --> 00:22:16,010
- Yes! Exactly!
- I knew it!

292
00:22:16,010 --> 00:22:20,110
But come on, Claire, those are superficial things.

293
00:22:20,850 --> 00:22:26,750
And you seem like anything but superficial, so, what do you really like about him?

294
00:22:29,790 --> 00:22:33,790
well, I like the way he treats me, you know?

295
00:22:33,790 --> 00:22:37,490
He makes me feel good. Like I’m kind of okay.

296
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:43,090
Like I’m smart and talented and pretty.

297
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:48,140
Hello!
Totally embarrassing.

298
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:53,340
No, no, no. Women tell me this kind of thing all the time. I’m the guy who listens.

299
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:55,640
Yeah, you do listen.

300
00:22:57,060 --> 00:23:00,360
That’s really nice about you. I really like talking to you.

301
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:01,860
I like listening to you.

302
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:04,260
Well, I hope it could go both ways.

303
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:06,910
If you’re dating anyone, you can totally talk to me.

304
00:23:06,910 --> 00:23:10,110
Thanks, but, no, I’m not dating. No dating.

305
00:23:10,110 --> 00:23:17,810
I think I’m kind of allergic, actually. I start itching and swell up and bleed profusely.

306
00:23:19,090 --> 00:23:25,100
But no, it sounds really nice, having somebody in your life that makes you hate yourself less.

307
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:26,300
I could use that.

308
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:28,500
Oh, come on, I mean, you’re great.

309
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:32,200
- I wasn’t fishing.
- I’m serious, Russell. I think you’re great.

310
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:36,200
Well, tell me that when it’s two in the morning, and I’m laying in bed

311
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:39,200
and I’m eating my fourth bowl of cereal,

312
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:44,800
and I’m just beating myself up for some stupid thing I said in eighth grade.

313
00:23:46,030 --> 00:23:47,830
What kind of cereal?

314
00:23:47,830 --> 00:23:52,030
- Captain Crunch.
- Oh my God! I think we’re twins!

315
00:23:57,830 --> 00:24:02,800
I don’t know. This whole “Oops! I’m pregnant! ” thing still sounds kind of suspicious to me.

316
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:04,800
I’m just surprised he married her.

317
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:08,640
But if Nate’s happy, that’s all I care about.

318
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:13,340
So are you still mad about this morning? I’m really sorry I missed therapy.

319
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:17,240
No, I was happy you weren’t there. Frank was, too.

320
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:19,240
Frank loves me!

321
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:21,740
Yeah, but he thinks you’ve got a lot of work to do on yourself.

322
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:24,440
That’s so not true!

323
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:27,380
I mean, maybe it’s true, but he’d never say that.

324
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:30,180
So did you talk about me the whole time?

325
00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:34,170
After we both decided that you were a hopeless, passive- aggressive guilt sponge,

326
00:24:34,170 --> 00:24:36,570
we decided to move on to more important things.

327
00:24:36,570 --> 00:24:38,870
God, I’m never gonna miss therapy again!

328
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:41,840
You bet you won’t, bitch!

329
00:24:49,770 --> 00:24:51,770
Well, hello.

330
00:24:54,590 --> 00:24:57,790
Hey, Dave, how are you? Good to see you.

331
00:24:57,790 --> 00:24:59,790
Keith, good to see you.

332
00:25:02,170 --> 00:25:06,540
Lisa used to burn the fuck out of everything until I discovered the miracle of low even heat.

333
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:13,880
The secret is mesquite wood chips. Gotta use mesquite.

334
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:19,480
No, man, that’s just a gimmick. It’s the marinade that makes all the difference.

335
00:25:20,490 --> 00:25:22,590
I just like wearing the apron.

336
00:25:24,770 --> 00:25:26,770
where’d you put her blue blankie?

337
00:25:26,770 --> 00:25:29,570
It took forever to put her down, and you know she can’t sleep without it.

338
00:25:29,570 --> 00:25:32,070
- I didn’t put it anywhere.
- I couldn’t find it.

339
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,780
Well, did you give her Mr. Fat Fanny? She likes him.

340
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:36,780
He’s in her sweet little hands.

341
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:41,980
Alright.
I think we’re ready.

342
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:47,080
Good. Let me go wash up. Where’s your little boy’s room?

343
00:25:48,050 --> 00:25:51,050
The…bathroom is in the back, behind the kitchen.

344
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:54,250
But don’t flush the toilet. We don’t want to wake Maya.

345
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:58,100
So, how’s the choir going?

346
00:25:58,660 --> 00:26:02,260
Well, it’s not a choir, it’s a chorus, but it’s going well.

347
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:04,560
Great! I can’t wait to hear you!

348
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:06,760
Oh, no eggplant for me.

349
00:26:07,230 --> 00:26:09,430
Uh—I’ll–I’ll take his.

350
00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:12,580
- Mozzarella?
- Yes

351
00:26:54,490 --> 00:26:56,690
- Great.
- I'll go.

352
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:03,220
- What’d I miss?
- You woke the baby.

353
00:27:03,810 --> 00:27:06,510
- It wasn’t asleep.
- Yes, it was.

354
00:27:06,510 --> 00:27:08,180
It wasn’t. It looked at me when I walked in.

355
00:27:08,180 --> 00:27:09,980
{\i1}Damn, I told him not to flush.

356
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:13,680
{\i1}Well, maybe he had to flush. David said he had that irritable bowel thing.

357
00:27:15,350 --> 00:27:18,150
- Why’d you tell him that?
- It just came up.

358
00:27:18,150 --> 00:27:20,550
Well, please, don’t discuss my private stuff with anyone.

359
00:27:20,550 --> 00:27:23,250
- I’m sorry.
{\i1}- We’re never gonna get her back to sleep.

360
00:27:23,250 --> 00:27:24,950
And, by the way, I only peed.

361
00:27:24,950 --> 00:27:26,950
You shouldn’t have flushed.

362
00:27:26,950 --> 00:27:28,950
It WASN’T asleep!

363
00:27:29,050 --> 00:27:34,940
{\i1}Maya, row the boat ashore
Hallelujah

364
00:27:41,490 --> 00:27:44,750
{\i1}My brother and sisters are all aboard…

365
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:49,060
That song has never sounded so creepy before.

366
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:51,060
I know.

367
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:17,500
You’ve gotta be kidding me. What’s he doing here?

368
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:20,100
Hey, it wasn’t my idea.

369
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:23,300
Oooh, look at you in your fancy fucking suit.

370
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:24,900
I knew I never should have hired you.

371
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:26,900
No, what you shouldn’t have done is fired me.

372
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:28,700
You were a fuck- up!

373
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:31,800
Jesus, could you have made the hole a little bigger?

374
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:34,800
Why can’t you guys shoot yourself in the heart once in a while?

375
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:37,300
Maybe I was trying to make a statement.

376
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:40,270
Besides, it’s not really my problem.

377
00:28:40,270 --> 00:28:42,270
Oh, yeah. Nothing’s your problem.

378
00:28:42,270 --> 00:28:44,070
Blow me, dead man!

379
00:28:44,070 --> 00:28:47,170
- He had a wife and kids, asshole.
- Lucky him! I didn’t have shit!

380
00:28:47,170 --> 00:28:50,670
So whose fault is that? You couldn’t even show up to work on time!

381
00:28:50,670 --> 00:28:53,070
Maybe if you hadn’t been such a goddamn prick!

382
00:28:53,070 --> 00:28:55,830
You know, it’s because of people like you that I had to do this!

383
00:28:55,830 --> 00:28:58,230
What are you saying? This is my fault?

384
00:28:58,230 --> 00:29:02,930
I’m just saying…a guy can only take so much before he snaps.

385
00:29:02,930 --> 00:29:08,730
Hey, hey, you know, we all have to deal with a lot of shit, all right?

386
00:29:08,730 --> 00:29:10,930
But when I snap, I throw something,

387
00:29:10,930 --> 00:29:14,530
or I punch a wall. I don’t pick up a shotgun and start killing people.

388
00:29:15,970 --> 00:29:18,770
Yeah. So far.

389
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:26,830
God, it feels so good to sit here and do absolutely nothing.

390
00:29:27,030 --> 00:29:30,330
We relax all the time. We have to.

391
00:29:37,750 --> 00:29:40,370
So, how do you like your new job, Keith?

392
00:29:41,190 --> 00:29:44,790
Uh, well…it pretty much sucks.

393
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:50,040
It’s temporary. We’re both going through a lot of changes right now.

394
00:29:50,190 --> 00:29:52,090
All good, though.

395
00:29:52,090 --> 00:29:54,090
So, how’s the therapy going?

396
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:59,820
Um, good. We’re not fighting so much.

397
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:04,820
I mean, we never really fought that much, but… we’re getting along much better.

398
00:30:05,190 --> 00:30:07,190
Nate and I never fight.

399
00:30:07,190 --> 00:30:08,890
Never?

400
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:10,890
No.

401
00:30:10,890 --> 00:30:12,890
You two have never had a fight?

402
00:30:15,850 --> 00:30:17,250
Not really.

403
00:30:17,250 --> 00:30:19,250
I don’t know how you do it.

404
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:24,040
We’ve known each other for so long, I guess we just understand each other.

405
00:30:28,180 --> 00:30:31,980
Even so, I would think having a baby adds so much stress.

406
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:35,280
No, actually, having a baby helps put everything in perspective.

407
00:30:35,870 --> 00:30:37,780
You’ll see when you have kids.

408
00:30:37,780 --> 00:30:39,880
If we have kids.

409
00:30:40,660 --> 00:30:44,140
Knock knock! Oh, look, a party!

410
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:47,340
Hello, I’m Carol, Lisa’s boss.

411
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:50,140
- Keith.
- I’m David…Fisher.

412
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:51,840
This is my house.

413
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:53,440
Well, you’re back early.

414
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:55,840
There’s nothing to do in the mountains! Nothing!

415
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:58,740
I mean, like fresh air’s such a big deal?

416
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:03,660
- At least no one parks in my driveway there.
- Oh, should we move?

417
00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:06,860
Lisa, I would love some cinnamon toast and a cup of tea.

418
00:31:07,550 --> 00:31:09,240
Could you wait just a little bit?

419
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:13,840
You would not believe the day I’ve had! Who is my most bitter enemy…

420
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:15,840
…the one person I hate most in the world?

421
00:31:16,810 --> 00:31:18,510
We’re having a little get- together…

422
00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:20,510
Melissa Gilbert.

423
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:23,340
And who opens the door at Mark and Pam’s house?

424
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:25,840
That’s right, Melissa Gilbert!

425
00:31:26,060 --> 00:31:29,240
It was like staring at evil itself.

426
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:30,740
Carol, you’re not listening to me.

427
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:33,140
Honey, I heard you. You’re having a party.

428
00:31:33,710 --> 00:31:36,510
They’ve had you all day, I need you right now.

429
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:40,160
Bring my toast up to my bath and I’ll tell you how I made Melissa cry!

430
00:31:45,990 --> 00:31:48,510
Go ahead, we’re fine.

431
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:52,780
Man, can you believe Lisa?

432
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:56,140
I’ve never met anyone who’s self- perception is so far removed from reality.

433
00:31:56,140 --> 00:32:01,840
Keith—what were you talking about in there? If we have kids?

434
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:04,640
Just what I said. If we have kids.

435
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:08,840
I thought we decided a long time ago that we’d have kids. When did this change?

436
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:13,740
Who are you kidding? We’re in therapy now to see if we can even exist as a couple.

437
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:15,740
Everything about us is if.

438
00:32:15,740 --> 00:32:17,740
But that shouldn’t change our goals.

439
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:20,800
I’m just being realistic.

440
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:25,000
I don’t want to put myself into a situation where I end up turning into my father.

441
00:32:28,890 --> 00:32:32,930
I guess maybe I’m a little more optimistic about our future than you are.

442
00:32:32,930 --> 00:32:37,430
Oh, get real! You and I living day- to- day, and you know it!

443
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:50,080
Oh, God, I’m freezing! Oh, God, this sucks!

444
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:51,680
I’m dying!

445
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:53,680
It’ll pass.

446
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:54,880
Give me a Klonopine!

447
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:58,880
You wanted to do this natural! I already gave you the Kava- Kava and the Valerian root.

448
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,880
They’re not doing shit…give me a Klonopine!

449
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:02,880
She’s impossible!

450
00:33:07,650 --> 00:33:10,150
- Now give me an ambient.
- Sarah, really—

451
00:33:10,150 --> 00:33:11,750
Well, it’ll put her to sleep.

452
00:33:11,750 --> 00:33:13,750
Anything to shut you up!

453
00:33:17,490 --> 00:33:20,000
- Now I’m burning up!
- A moment ago, you were freezing!

454
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,900
Well, now I’m burning up.

455
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:26,080
- Now what?
- Diarrhea!

456
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:29,880
This is what playing with drugs will get you! It’s not pretty, is it?

457
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:44,120
You get Carol all tucked in?

458
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:47,720
After eight slices of cinnamon toast and a popsicle!

459
00:33:50,990 --> 00:33:54,360
- It was nice seeing David and Keith tonight.
- Yeah.

460
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:58,460
I feel so sorry for them.

461
00:33:58,580 --> 00:34:00,380
Yeah, how come?

462
00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:04,280
I mean, God, they’ve been together such a short time, and already they need counseling?

463
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:05,280
Well, they’re just—

464
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:08,080
If they have so many problems, why even stay together?

465
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:10,080
It’s not like they have a kid to take care of.

466
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:13,580
I don’t know. Maybe they love each other.

467
00:34:17,350 --> 00:34:18,450
What?

468
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:21,620
What detergent did you use?

469
00:34:21,620 --> 00:34:23,620
I don’t know. Whatever was there.

470
00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:26,740
It smells like Tide.

471
00:34:26,740 --> 00:34:28,740
So I guess I used the Tide.

472
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:32,430
You have to use the Dreft. Maya gets a rash from anything else.

473
00:34:32,430 --> 00:34:34,130
Those aren’t Maya’s clothes. They’re ours.

474
00:34:34,130 --> 00:34:36,390
Yeah, but I hold Maya all day long.

475
00:34:36,390 --> 00:34:38,390
So why do we even have Tide?

476
00:34:38,390 --> 00:34:39,990
I’m sorry I wasn’t following you around taking notes!

477
00:34:39,990 --> 00:34:42,490
Nate, don’t get mad. I just thought you knew to use the Dreft.

478
00:34:42,490 --> 00:34:46,090
Well, obviously I didn’t. Now I do. Are we okay here?

479
00:34:46,090 --> 00:34:48,560
Yeah, we’re okay. I just have to wash it all over.

480
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:50,960
No, no, you don’t.

481
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:55,160
Here, put those down. Here. I’ll do it.

482
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,460
Thank you.

483
00:35:13,570 --> 00:35:15,410
Good afternoon.

484
00:35:15,410 --> 00:35:17,710
- Is he…?
- He’s right in there.

485
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:24,650
Mr. and Mrs. Showalter, I will be here the entire time.

486
00:35:24,690 --> 00:35:27,950
Please let me know if there’s anything at all I can do for you.

487
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:46,770
Is that another son?

488
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:52,090
- Well, I hope you frisked him.
- Please try to show a little sensitivity.

489
00:35:54,890 --> 00:35:59,790
I did my job. I cleaned him up all nice.

490
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:05,260
Sure, I was tempted maybe to leave a hand or a foot unembalmed,

491
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:08,540
so he could stink like he should, but no.

492
00:36:10,390 --> 00:36:13,180
- I’m a professional.
- Then act like one

493
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:16,040
These people loved this man.

494
00:36:19,870 --> 00:36:23,170
They didn’t know him as a murderer. They knew him as their son.

495
00:36:23,170 --> 00:36:25,170
As their brother.

496
00:36:26,070 --> 00:36:28,530
These are the people who are responsible for him.

497
00:36:28,530 --> 00:36:30,230
They should have known what was going on inside of him.

498
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:35,130
Jesus Christ, Federico! I’m really getting sick of all this moral superiority!

499
00:36:35,130 --> 00:36:37,930
Everything is so goddamn black and white for you.

500
00:36:37,930 --> 00:36:39,930
You know what? I just think—

501
00:36:42,170 --> 00:36:46,630
You can’t ever really know a person. If you think you can, you’re living in a fucking dream world.

502
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,670
I made egg salad.

503
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:05,200
Jolts of electricity are shooting through my body and tearing me apart.

504
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:07,700
Then Bettina and I will eat.

505
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:17,150
Maybe I’ll have a little.

506
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:30,640
So, how long have you been taking the Vicodin?

507
00:37:32,390 --> 00:37:34,390
I don’t know.

508
00:37:36,670 --> 00:37:38,850
On and off for years.

509
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:41,100
Why?

510
00:37:48,330 --> 00:37:53,770
Because, somewhere along the line, I started to realize

511
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:59,100
I was no longer the youngest or prettiest girl in the room.

512
00:38:03,020 --> 00:38:05,960
For a while I satisfied myself

513
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:10,760
with being the most intriguing…

514
00:38:12,250 --> 00:38:15,550
but eventually I just became the one in paisley. It’s too fucking depressing.

515
00:38:16,550 --> 00:38:19,050
It’s too fucking depressing.

516
00:38:19,050 --> 00:38:21,650
I’m sorry, dear, but you know you’re much more than that.

517
00:38:21,650 --> 00:38:24,050
Yeah, you’re a drug addict!

518
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:27,520
I need to spice this up a little.

519
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:28,920
Tell me what you want, and I’ll get it.

520
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:31,120
- No, no, no, I’ll get...
- Sit down

521
00:38:31,150 --> 00:38:34,070
- I need spices!
- Where is it?

522
00:38:34,070 --> 00:38:36,770
- In the kitchen.
- Where is the Vicodin?

523
00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:38,690
I don’t know what you’re talking—

524
00:38:38,690 --> 00:38:42,490
We already found your stash in the laundry room and in the bookcase. Where else?

525
00:38:42,490 --> 00:38:45,090
- In the spice rack?
- You’re being ridiculous.

526
00:38:45,090 --> 00:38:47,640
- Let me go!
- Where’s the Vicodin?

527
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:50,940
- You’re hurting me!
- Where?

528
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:56,860
In the coriander jar, you pigfucker!

529
00:38:56,860 --> 00:38:59,320
Your lies aren’t helping, dear.

530
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:07,880
Here. Ruth and I are gonna go
outside and get some air.

531
00:39:08,790 --> 00:39:10,760
What—what are you doing?

532
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:12,960
You don’t think I’m just gonna leave you?

533
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:15,660
You can’t tie me up!

534
00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:18,260
It’s for your own good.

535
00:39:20,610 --> 00:39:23,620
Do you want me to break this arm?
because i will

536
00:39:30,930 --> 00:39:33,030
Yeah, that should hold.

537
00:39:39,170 --> 00:39:42,510
I hope the coyotes eat you!

538
00:39:42,610 --> 00:39:44,710
So do I!

539
00:39:56,860 --> 00:39:59,590
I don’t know how you remain so calm.

540
00:39:59,590 --> 00:40:01,590
I took a Vicodin!

541
00:40:01,990 --> 00:40:04,590
- Not really?
- Yeah

542
00:40:04,590 --> 00:40:06,890
I figured, if there was ever a time…

543
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:09,840
You want one?

544
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:11,840
Oh, no, thank you.

545
00:40:15,850 --> 00:40:17,730
Well, maybe half.

546
00:40:24,910 --> 00:40:29,610
HELLPPPP!!!

547
00:40:34,690 --> 00:40:38,170
- I think there’s some meatloaf in here.
- Yeah, okay

548
00:40:45,330 --> 00:40:49,810
- You’re…Phil, right? The crematory guy?
- Yeah, hey, Nate?

549
00:40:51,570 --> 00:40:53,470
- What?
- Nothing.

550
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:01,800
Mom called. She’s spending another night at Aunt Sarah’s.

551
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:05,300
Cool. We can just stay here, then.

552
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:07,000
Sure.

553
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:11,260
Also, there’s a couple of death certificates you can pick up tomorrow.

554
00:41:11,580 --> 00:41:14,280
- Where?
- one’s at a nursing home,

555
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:18,180
and the other, I think…is also at a nursing home.

556
00:41:18,180 --> 00:41:23,480
I hate those places! All the old people want to touch my hair.

557
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:49,340
Hey, Lis.

558
00:41:50,410 --> 00:41:52,810
No, I’ll probably just grab a sandwich here.

559
00:41:54,660 --> 00:41:58,560
I’ll probably be leaving in about an hour or so. I’ve still got a bunch of shit to do.

560
00:41:58,780 --> 00:42:02,840
I love you, too. Give Maya a kiss for me.
Bye.

561
00:42:12,380 --> 00:42:15,040
- So, Nate’s the one who just got married?
- Yeah

562
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:18,280
Do you like his wife?

563
00:42:19,290 --> 00:42:23,290
I don’t really know her that well. But, I mean, I like her.

564
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:26,200
You should’ve met his last girlfriend.

565
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:29,510
She was “Charlotte: Light and Dark”.

566
00:42:29,510 --> 00:42:32,810
Not for real? The barking girl?

567
00:42:32,810 --> 00:42:34,410
For real.

568
00:42:38,530 --> 00:42:41,320
- You want another?
- No, I’m good.

569
00:42:42,750 --> 00:42:48,120
So, we should do something, like next Friday or Saturday.

570
00:42:53,590 --> 00:42:55,730
Do you have a really busy week?

571
00:42:58,100 --> 00:42:59,600
I don’t know.

572
00:43:00,030 --> 00:43:05,970
Because, when you say “next Friday or Saturday, ” that kind of sounds like not until next Friday or Saturday.

573
00:43:11,350 --> 00:43:17,400
Have you been thinking the two of us are, well, you know, exclusive?

574
00:43:18,250 --> 00:43:21,450
Because I never really meant to give that impression.

575
00:43:24,170 --> 00:43:26,070
- What do you mean?
- Well...

576
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:29,120
that sometimes I see other women.

577
00:43:33,550 --> 00:43:36,390
And by “see, ” you mean “fuck. ”

578
00:43:37,650 --> 00:43:39,750
However you wanna put it.

579
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:45,520
Yeah, I mean, I figured…

580
00:43:48,090 --> 00:43:52,810
Until you really get to know someone, I just… seems the way to go.

581
00:43:53,910 --> 00:43:55,910
Yeah, of course.

582
00:43:56,730 --> 00:43:58,840
You see other guys, don’t you?

583
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:01,040
You’re always talking about Russell.

584
00:44:01,140 --> 00:44:03,040
Russell’s gay.

585
00:44:06,050 --> 00:44:12,630
But…I guess, if I was to meet someone…not that I’m looking to fuck around, but…

586
00:44:13,740 --> 00:44:16,540
I guess if I liked someone, whatever…

587
00:44:16,940 --> 00:44:18,540
Cool.

588
00:44:34,900 --> 00:44:36,920
Are you mad?

589
00:44:43,990 --> 00:44:45,450
Do you want me to go?

590
00:44:48,270 --> 00:44:50,270
No.

591
00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:06,050
Do you want to go up to your room?

592
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:10,260
Yeah, let’s go.

593
00:45:34,730 --> 00:45:38,060
Baby, I’m warning you…I’m in a bad mood! I had a very bad day!

594
00:45:38,060 --> 00:45:42,160
I just found out that one of my favorite doctors was arrested for selling steroids.

595
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:46,060
And, oh, now there’s a rumor flying around that AmeriMed’s gonna close the hospital.

596
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:49,020
- That’s great.
- There’s KFC in the microwave.

597
00:45:49,840 --> 00:45:53,570
I’m sorry, I just had to get you out from under my feet for a while.

598
00:45:57,870 --> 00:46:00,340
Julio, could you please turn that damn thing down?

599
00:46:42,210 --> 00:46:43,690
Are you going to the store tomorrow?

600
00:46:43,690 --> 00:46:46,790
I wasn’t planning on it.
What do you need?

601
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:50,920
Baby wipes. And baby food. But you have to go to Whole Foods for that.

602
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:51,820
All right.

603
00:46:51,820 --> 00:46:55,020
But if you go to Rite Aid, you can get her a new sippy cup, and I lost her nail clippers.

604
00:46:55,020 --> 00:46:58,720
Make sure you get them in the baby section. The others are too big.

605
00:46:58,920 --> 00:47:04,320
toilet paper, light bulbs, the energy efficient ones, and...

606
00:47:04,520 --> 00:47:07,020
...facial scrub for me, y’know? The peach kind.

607
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:10,160
All right. You’re gonna have to write everything down.

608
00:47:10,750 --> 00:47:12,750
It’s on the refrigerator.

609
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:17,600
All right. I’ll try to do it on my way home from work.

610
00:47:19,240 --> 00:47:21,810
You’re going to try, or you’ll do it?

611
00:47:22,650 --> 00:47:25,050
Only because if you can’t, then I’ll do it.

612
00:47:25,050 --> 00:47:26,650
I’ll do it.

613
00:47:27,380 --> 00:47:29,680
- Thank you.
- You’re welcome.

614
00:47:33,870 --> 00:47:39,620
I had to make carrot soup for Carol’s stylist today and drive it out to her in Culver City.

615
00:47:39,620 --> 00:47:42,620
You know that woman has been sent to earth for the sole purpose of torturing you, right?

616
00:47:42,620 --> 00:47:46,220
{\i1}- God, it’s true!
{\i0}- I don’t even work for her, and she drives me crazy!

617
00:47:47,360 --> 00:47:50,760
She wants me to make her rice pudding tomorrow. I think I’ll use whole milk.

618
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:52,760
It gives her diarrhea.

619
00:47:56,340 --> 00:47:59,850
You know, we could call all our friends and have them park in her driveway.

620
00:48:00,770 --> 00:48:04,150
We could take pictures of her swimming naked and post them on the Internet!

621
00:48:04,150 --> 00:48:08,550
Oh my God, I saw her once! She has the biggest bush I have ever seen in my life!

622
00:48:08,550 --> 00:48:10,550
She really does!

623
00:48:21,460 --> 00:48:24,590
If I told you something, would you promise not to laugh?

624
00:48:24,790 --> 00:48:26,590
No.

625
00:48:28,930 --> 00:48:32,300
This is the first time I’ve ever been in a hammock.

626
00:48:32,500 --> 00:48:34,300
They’ve always scared me.

627
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:40,760
I always saw them in cartoons,

628
00:48:40,760 --> 00:48:46,460
and the people would get in them and spin around so fast that people would go flying!

629
00:48:46,910 --> 00:48:49,810
Well, don’t worry. You’re safe.

630
00:49:06,940 --> 00:49:09,740
It’s so peaceful out here.

631
00:49:20,950 --> 00:49:24,350
- You want some more wine?
- Sure. Why not?

632
00:49:24,850 --> 00:49:26,550
I’M DYING!!!!!

633
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:30,170
- Take a slug right out of the bottle.
- Really?

634
00:49:30,170 --> 00:49:32,170
Go on!

635
00:49:33,900 --> 00:49:36,560
I feel like an old hobo.

636
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:39,840
Maybe we should hop a freight train.

637
00:49:40,700 --> 00:49:42,700
We could head up to Frisco!

638
00:49:44,360 --> 00:49:46,400
Pick us up a couple of sailors!

639
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:50,730
We’re so bad!

640
00:49:51,740 --> 00:49:53,900
Yes, we are!

641
00:49:59,690 --> 00:50:04,010
