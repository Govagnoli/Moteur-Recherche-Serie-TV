1
00:01:42,683 --> 00:01:47,598
- Piece of shit's whacked.
- Try the celly again.

2
00:01:48,564 --> 00:01:52,921
And it ain't no piece of shit. The
alternator's a little temperamental.

3
00:01:53,164 --> 00:01:57,362
Well, maybe the battery's dead,
like this phone.

4
00:01:57,564 --> 00:01:59,999
Look, it ain't the battery.
It's the alt...

5
00:02:05,245 --> 00:02:08,875
Hey, this is like one of them
Scream movies, huh?

6
00:02:09,766 --> 00:02:11,961
More like Boyz N the Hood.

7
00:02:12,846 --> 00:02:15,599
I'm gonna jet to that phone.
One of my dogs'll hook us up.

8
00:02:15,846 --> 00:02:17,724
I know you ain't leaving
me here all alone.

9
00:02:17,967 --> 00:02:22,006
Hey, look, you'll be safer in here.
Be back in three, all right?

10
00:02:22,207 --> 00:02:26,439
- All right.
- Give me some love.

11
00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:55,607
Ain't nobody home,
Leave a message,

12
00:02:55,810 --> 00:03:00,043
Hey, Luis, pick up the phone, dog.
Hey, wake up, man.

13
00:03:05,611 --> 00:03:07,125
Damn.

14
00:03:07,612 --> 00:03:10,001
Fucking lazy-ass punk,
motherfucker man.

15
00:03:14,012 --> 00:03:15,923
Paco! Oh, my God!

16
00:03:20,053 --> 00:03:22,442
Who the fuck is it?

17
00:03:22,933 --> 00:03:24,332
Hello?

18
00:03:25,133 --> 00:03:26,646
Hello?

19
00:03:27,654 --> 00:03:29,326
Hello!

20
00:03:33,294 --> 00:03:37,607
- Where you from?
- Your mama's pussy, bitch.

21
00:03:37,855 --> 00:03:40,449
Paco! Paco!

22
00:03:40,735 --> 00:03:44,523
Paco, no! No!

23
00:03:44,775 --> 00:03:46,333
- Let's go.
- No!

24
00:03:47,256 --> 00:03:50,248
No! No!

25
00:04:03,457 --> 00:04:09,408
Miss Chenowith gave us her account
of your activities at the crime scene.

26
00:04:09,658 --> 00:04:11,614
Crime scene? So you're
saying it was arson?

27
00:04:11,818 --> 00:04:13,888
What's your story, Mr. Fisher?

28
00:04:17,379 --> 00:04:21,088
The house is empty. I wanted to show
Brenda where I hung out as a kid.

29
00:04:21,339 --> 00:04:23,569
I don't know why he
wanted to show it to me.

30
00:04:23,819 --> 00:04:26,049
Can you tell us what you did
while you were there?

31
00:04:26,259 --> 00:04:28,694
Walked around, looked at things.

32
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:33,291
You really expect us to believe you
broke into an abandoned house...

33
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:36,094
...just to walk around?

34
00:04:38,221 --> 00:04:41,179
Okay. We fucked.

35
00:04:41,421 --> 00:04:44,219
- You were there for an hour or so?
- Tops.

36
00:04:44,421 --> 00:04:48,335
Could you walk us through what the
two of you did for that hour?

37
00:04:48,542 --> 00:04:52,057
We made love.

38
00:04:52,262 --> 00:04:56,495
Could you please be as
specific as possible?

39
00:04:56,703 --> 00:05:00,173
Just to establish a timeline.

40
00:05:00,743 --> 00:05:06,376
Well, he went down on
me for a while.

41
00:05:06,584 --> 00:05:08,063
He's really good at it.

42
00:05:08,304 --> 00:05:12,183
I don't exactly remember
the specifics.

43
00:05:12,424 --> 00:05:15,621
He was in a state, like he had
a lot of aggression to work out.

44
00:05:15,864 --> 00:05:18,140
She said that I was aggressive?

45
00:05:18,825 --> 00:05:21,385
- Man, she should talk.
- Then he fell asleep.

46
00:05:21,625 --> 00:05:25,015
- What happened then?
- We were exhausted, so we left.

47
00:05:25,225 --> 00:05:30,346
I left to meet somebody. He was just
waking up. I don't know what he did.

48
00:05:30,586 --> 00:05:34,625
- Can I go?
- I think we have everything we need.

49
00:05:34,826 --> 00:05:38,979
- Thank you for your cooperation.
- Peace out, guys.

50
00:05:39,187 --> 00:05:41,542
Well, yeah, she left first,
I left right after that,

51
00:05:41,787 --> 00:05:47,260
Are you aware that the property was
purchased by Kroehner Service?

52
00:05:47,508 --> 00:05:51,137
Yes, Matt Gilardi said they were planning
to open a cheap cremation place...

53
00:05:51,348 --> 00:05:52,747
...and put us out of business.

54
00:05:52,948 --> 00:05:57,739
Was that the point where you called
him a "greedy Nazi fuck"?

55
00:05:57,949 --> 00:06:01,942
- Is that correct?
- Yes, that is correct.

56
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:08,587
You think I set the fire?

57
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:10,508
Well, you have to admit...

58
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:13,907
...it does seem like a beneficial
turn of events for your business.

59
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:16,944
- So, what, do I need a lawyer?
- Not yet.

60
00:06:17,151 --> 00:06:18,630
You're free to go.

61
00:06:21,391 --> 00:06:23,951
Actually, one more thing.

62
00:06:24,151 --> 00:06:26,905
Do you know where your sister
was on the night of the fire?

63
00:06:27,112 --> 00:06:28,511
No, why?

64
00:06:28,712 --> 00:06:34,150
I understand she had a run-in with
the law recently. A missing foot.

65
00:06:34,352 --> 00:06:38,631
If she is developing a pattern of acting
out subsequent to her father's death...

66
00:06:38,873 --> 00:06:41,148
Claire had nothing to
do with that fire.

67
00:06:41,433 --> 00:06:43,503
How do you know?

68
00:06:45,474 --> 00:06:48,989
I knew passing the health department
inspection was too good to be true.

69
00:06:49,194 --> 00:06:51,867
It just meant something
else would go wrong.

70
00:06:53,234 --> 00:06:55,465
Great, there goes a month's profit.

71
00:06:55,675 --> 00:06:58,587
We can live without air conditioning.
Plenty of people do.

72
00:06:58,835 --> 00:07:01,508
Yeah, people in the Third World.

73
00:07:01,715 --> 00:07:04,149
We can't run a business
without air conditioning.

74
00:07:04,355 --> 00:07:05,914
If we lose any more funerals...

75
00:07:06,116 --> 00:07:09,506
...Kroehner won't have to take
us over. We'll be bankrupt.

76
00:07:10,876 --> 00:07:14,664
- How much?
- Central air, three grand easy.

77
00:07:14,876 --> 00:07:19,075
Guess what.
Gilardi tipped the cops off.

78
00:07:19,277 --> 00:07:22,906
- Think I'm a suspect.
- That's ridiculous.

79
00:07:23,117 --> 00:07:26,747
- Where's Claire?
- School. I hope.

80
00:07:26,958 --> 00:07:28,994
Do you know where
she was before the fire?

81
00:07:29,198 --> 00:07:33,077
Why, what is it? Oh, dear God,
they don't think...

82
00:07:33,278 --> 00:07:35,634
Oh, she couldn't have.

83
00:07:36,279 --> 00:07:37,632
Good news, bad news.

84
00:07:37,879 --> 00:07:41,474
Compressor's fine. Bad news is, your
pneumatic actuator assembly is shot.

85
00:07:41,839 --> 00:07:45,310
Normally, I could do it in a day, but
with this heat wave, give me five days.

86
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,795
- Five?
- What's it gonna set us back?

87
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,356
Shouldn't debt you more than
3700, parts and labor.

88
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:54,396
Our 10:00.

89
00:07:56,201 --> 00:07:58,920
Tell them we'll have air conditioning.

90
00:07:59,521 --> 00:08:01,751
Three days.

91
00:08:07,402 --> 00:08:10,712
He would have been 21 next week.

92
00:08:11,922 --> 00:08:15,074
We were gonna buy him a new bed.

93
00:08:15,323 --> 00:08:20,158
- Now we're buying him a coffin.
- Three in the morning.

94
00:08:20,363 --> 00:08:23,673
He shouldn't have been out with
that girl in that neighborhood.

95
00:08:23,963 --> 00:08:28,162
It's the worst thing that can happen,
to lose a child.

96
00:08:28,364 --> 00:08:30,878
We lost him years ago.

97
00:08:33,844 --> 00:08:37,599
- We'll see to it that Paco...
- His name is Manny.

98
00:08:41,365 --> 00:08:45,359
- His gang name was Paco.
- He goes by Paco.

99
00:08:45,566 --> 00:08:48,763
And he wasn't lost,
he was assassinated.

100
00:08:51,286 --> 00:08:53,595
We'll see to it that he
has a dignified service.

101
00:08:53,806 --> 00:08:56,958
We've been to three funeral
homes. No one will take us.

102
00:08:57,207 --> 00:08:59,880
We don't turn people away here.

103
00:09:00,087 --> 00:09:04,400
But sometimes when families lack
the funds necessary or insurance...

104
00:09:04,648 --> 00:09:07,162
- I got money.
- We don't want your money.

105
00:09:07,848 --> 00:09:09,679
If your son is willing to finance...

106
00:09:09,888 --> 00:09:14,724
- He's not our son!
- He's a gang leader. Alvarado Kings.

107
00:09:15,649 --> 00:09:19,324
- Don't you read the papers?
- My name is Powerful.

108
00:09:22,209 --> 00:09:26,408
Paco's gonna have a fat-ass
funeral whatever it costs.

109
00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:30,922
We got mad cash, so long as
you all can do it up right.

110
00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:35,079
Now, can you all do it up right
or should we move on?

111
00:09:38,891 --> 00:09:40,449
If you'll excuse me.

112
00:09:40,651 --> 00:09:45,521
Nate will show you flower arrangements,
which might be to your liking.

113
00:09:50,612 --> 00:09:53,445
Lilies are always nice.

114
00:10:02,053 --> 00:10:05,205
Federico, I need your help,
your expertise.

115
00:10:05,414 --> 00:10:09,168
- I've got a really tough one upstairs.
- Decomp? Crispy critter?

116
00:10:09,374 --> 00:10:11,842
Gunshots, no facial damage,
cut and dried.

117
00:10:12,054 --> 00:10:16,014
The family wants a traditional
Mexican funeral.

118
00:10:16,215 --> 00:10:19,571
Okay. What's a traditional
Mexican funeral?

119
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:23,655
But there's this other guy,
the deceased's gang leader.

120
00:10:27,496 --> 00:10:29,373
And what does this have
to do with me?

121
00:10:29,576 --> 00:10:32,852
I was hoping you would
talk to them for me. With me.

122
00:10:33,056 --> 00:10:36,094
What, because I'm Latino,
I know about gangs?

123
00:10:36,297 --> 00:10:38,253
Well, you probably
know more than I do.

124
00:10:38,497 --> 00:10:40,294
And why's that?

125
00:10:40,737 --> 00:10:45,209
Well, I just assumed that maybe
somebody in your family might...

126
00:10:45,418 --> 00:10:47,886
No, no one in my family. Never.

127
00:10:48,138 --> 00:10:51,210
I've worked here for years, and you
don't know a damn thing about me.

128
00:10:51,418 --> 00:10:53,774
- That's not true.
- You own an atlas?

129
00:10:54,019 --> 00:10:56,328
- An atlas?
- Yeah, because if you did...

130
00:10:56,579 --> 00:11:00,094
...you'd know there's 2400 miles
between Puerto Rico and Mexico.

131
00:11:00,339 --> 00:11:02,170
You're Puerto Rican?

132
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:10,888
Look, Federico, I'm
sorry. I just assumed...

133
00:11:18,781 --> 00:11:21,056
We can't afford to lose this funeral.

134
00:11:21,261 --> 00:11:25,141
And I'm afraid if Nate and I
are the point of contact, we will.

135
00:11:25,782 --> 00:11:30,298
This is our blue opal, 20 gauge
aluminum and copper...

136
00:11:30,502 --> 00:11:34,132
...with a light blue,
sovereign velvet interior.

137
00:11:34,343 --> 00:11:36,937
- It's nicer than our car.
- It's beautiful.

138
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:39,698
It's not good enough.

139
00:11:43,664 --> 00:11:50,012
Mrs. Bolin, if this is the casket you
want for your son, you should have it.

140
00:11:50,424 --> 00:11:52,176
He is your son.

141
00:11:52,664 --> 00:11:54,337
Hey.

142
00:11:55,705 --> 00:11:57,741
Where you from, dog?

143
00:12:04,506 --> 00:12:06,383
One moment, please.

144
00:12:16,747 --> 00:12:20,820
"Where you from?" Like, where
my parents were born?

145
00:12:21,027 --> 00:12:25,260
San Lorenzo, Puerto Rico.
"Where you from?"

146
00:12:25,468 --> 00:12:30,144
As in, what gang I belong to? Yeah,
I'll tell you what gang I belong to.

147
00:12:30,348 --> 00:12:33,739
The gang that's gonna help
you bury your friend.

148
00:12:33,949 --> 00:12:36,417
The gang that's gonna be there
for you and your cholos...

149
00:12:36,629 --> 00:12:40,747
...when every other home doesn't
wanna deal with your bullshit.

150
00:12:41,269 --> 00:12:43,386
Your friend is dead, man.

151
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:47,060
Now, do you want me to help you
or you just wanna go heads-up?

152
00:12:59,751 --> 00:13:01,264
It's good.

153
00:13:02,712 --> 00:13:07,740
- I don't like it. It's dangerous.
- Not if we let Rico handle everything.

154
00:13:07,952 --> 00:13:11,740
David, we are so white. If we
step in, we will totally fuck up.

155
00:13:11,992 --> 00:13:13,312
Language.

156
00:13:13,513 --> 00:13:15,743
I'm more worried whether
Claire started that fire.

157
00:13:15,993 --> 00:13:18,063
Why would she? To help us out?
She hates us.

158
00:13:18,313 --> 00:13:21,908
- Is Brenda a vegetarian?
- She'll eat anything.

159
00:13:27,394 --> 00:13:31,148
Did you know the night dad died,
Claire was high on crystal meth?

160
00:13:31,354 --> 00:13:34,188
Oh, my God,
isn't that a horse tranquilizer?

161
00:13:34,395 --> 00:13:37,273
No, it's speed, really nasty speed
that makes you crazy.

162
00:13:37,475 --> 00:13:39,625
If there are things
you don't want me to hear...

163
00:13:39,835 --> 00:13:41,951
...go talk about them in another room.

164
00:13:43,156 --> 00:13:47,308
- I assume she drinks.
- I can call and tell her to cancel.

165
00:13:47,556 --> 00:13:49,512
No, I've been looking
forward to this.

166
00:13:49,716 --> 00:13:53,107
I have some errands to run. I'll pick
up a nice chardonnay while I'm out.

167
00:13:53,317 --> 00:13:56,787
- What errands?
- I can give you a list if you'd like.

168
00:13:58,677 --> 00:14:02,751
You guys, this kid at school today
got busted for having a taser...

169
00:14:02,958 --> 00:14:05,108
...because he showed it to
his friends at lunch.

170
00:14:05,318 --> 00:14:09,630
What an idiot. There were like six
cops. It was absolutely hilarious.

171
00:14:10,958 --> 00:14:12,790
What?

172
00:14:14,999 --> 00:14:18,389
No, it's not really
a gang funeral. It's...

173
00:14:19,639 --> 00:14:22,108
They needed a home,
we needed a body. Everyone wins.

174
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:25,118
Yeah, right. Who you gonna call
when the bullets start flying?

175
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:28,551
- Anyone but you.
- Oh, you damn straight.

176
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:33,070
Claire's gonna need a lawyer.
A good one.

177
00:14:33,281 --> 00:14:36,956
Look, if she set that fire,
she'll do what's right. I'll see to it.

178
00:14:37,161 --> 00:14:41,074
What's right is getting her top legal
counsel and having her plead the Fifth.

179
00:14:41,281 --> 00:14:45,400
I don't care what you do, just keep her
out of the system. She'll be eaten alive.

180
00:14:45,602 --> 00:14:48,560
Any chance you can snoop around
and find out their game plan?

181
00:14:48,762 --> 00:14:51,230
I don't know. I already
interfered once.

182
00:14:51,442 --> 00:14:54,321
- Are you guys pulling out or what?
- Yeah, in a minute.

183
00:14:54,563 --> 00:14:56,838
Well, let's go.

184
00:15:05,724 --> 00:15:07,874
Fucking fags, man.

185
00:15:11,324 --> 00:15:13,043
Keith.

186
00:15:15,325 --> 00:15:16,724
Keith!

187
00:15:17,925 --> 00:15:19,677
- Say it again.
- What?

188
00:15:19,925 --> 00:15:23,123
I said, say it again. The next time
you call someone a fucking fag...

189
00:15:23,366 --> 00:15:26,199
...you make sure that fag
isn't an L.A.P.D. Officer.

190
00:15:26,446 --> 00:15:27,959
You got that?

191
00:15:28,846 --> 00:15:30,996
- You understand me?
- Yeah.

192
00:15:32,127 --> 00:15:35,324
Now, you got my badge,
file a complaint. I dare you.

193
00:15:35,807 --> 00:15:40,642
You get your punk ass out of here,
fucking bitch.

194
00:15:45,048 --> 00:15:49,485
- Tore his ass up.
- I don't think he meant anything by it.

195
00:15:49,688 --> 00:15:52,123
Do you hate yourself that much?

196
00:16:11,771 --> 00:16:15,320
This is some fucked up way to
make a living. You know that?

197
00:16:23,572 --> 00:16:27,963
- How's your day, man?
- You don't wanna know.

198
00:16:28,532 --> 00:16:32,003
You ever see sunlight?
Or you gotta avoid it?

199
00:16:35,853 --> 00:16:39,448
- Hey, you checking out my dick.
- I was not.

200
00:16:41,694 --> 00:16:44,208
I'm just fucking with you, man.

201
00:16:47,294 --> 00:16:48,488
Hi.

202
00:16:52,255 --> 00:16:57,170
A gift from my parents.
They'll freak when they find out.

203
00:16:57,375 --> 00:17:00,607
- You're an hour early.
- Really?

204
00:17:00,816 --> 00:17:02,090
Yeah.

205
00:17:07,736 --> 00:17:12,288
Not quite as Addams Family
as I'd expected.

206
00:17:12,497 --> 00:17:15,057
Dave and I used to play Addams
Family when we were kids.

207
00:17:15,257 --> 00:17:18,533
I was usually Gomez.
He was always Lurch.

208
00:17:19,937 --> 00:17:22,452
The kitsch factor is substantial.

209
00:17:22,658 --> 00:17:26,492
Hence your well-developed
sense of irony, I suppose.

210
00:17:26,978 --> 00:17:29,856
- It's hot in here.
- Do I hear voices?

211
00:17:30,058 --> 00:17:34,257
- Look who's early.
- It's a pleasure to see you again.

212
00:17:34,459 --> 00:17:37,337
I'm so glad you could make it, dear.

213
00:17:37,739 --> 00:17:41,858
Champagne. How festive. Thank you.

214
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:47,931
Excuse me, I'm knee-deep
in marinara. I'll go chill this.

215
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:51,214
Nate, give Brenda a tour.

216
00:17:54,461 --> 00:17:56,691
- She hates me.
- Why do you say that?

217
00:17:56,901 --> 00:17:58,812
Because it's true.

218
00:18:01,462 --> 00:18:04,499
What's the matter?
Afraid Mommy might see?

219
00:18:04,702 --> 00:18:08,092
Okay, okay. Can we not turn
tonight into psych 101?

220
00:18:08,302 --> 00:18:10,976
Because trust me, we'd never
make it through the evening.

221
00:18:11,183 --> 00:18:13,777
Somebody's defensive.

222
00:18:13,983 --> 00:18:17,976
Nate, it doesn't matter if your
mother likes me or not. I don't care.

223
00:18:23,304 --> 00:18:25,135
What's that shit?

224
00:18:25,704 --> 00:18:29,094
Oh, hell no. No.

225
00:18:31,985 --> 00:18:34,783
Hey, how come you don't
call your bone daddy?

226
00:18:35,385 --> 00:18:38,855
Still pissed at him, right?
Hey, I'm feeling you, man.

227
00:18:39,065 --> 00:18:42,502
What gives him the right to get up
in your world? You know, be so...?

228
00:18:42,706 --> 00:18:45,095
So fucking self-righteous?

229
00:18:46,026 --> 00:18:52,341
That's what I'm saying. You don't call
him nothing, but he went off on you.

230
00:18:52,547 --> 00:18:55,744
Yeah. I think he's got a problem with
that stress-management shit.

231
00:18:55,947 --> 00:18:59,257
Hey, or maybe he's one of
them rage-aholics.

232
00:18:59,467 --> 00:19:03,063
- I mean, that boy went off.
- Just because some kid calls him a fag.

233
00:19:03,308 --> 00:19:08,063
- It's so unnecessary.
- Well, he called you a fag too.

234
00:19:08,268 --> 00:19:11,067
- So?
- So, what'd you do?

235
00:19:11,309 --> 00:19:12,867
Nothing.

236
00:19:16,469 --> 00:19:19,940
And Simon Peter stood
and warmed himself.

237
00:19:20,590 --> 00:19:26,222
They said therefore unto him,
"Art not thou one of his disciples?"

238
00:19:26,430 --> 00:19:32,108
- He denied it and said, "I am not. "
- John 18:25.

239
00:19:32,311 --> 00:19:36,782
No wonder he went
off on you, man. You know?

240
00:19:39,552 --> 00:19:43,431
Hey, bury me naked, please.

241
00:19:43,632 --> 00:19:45,862
It's a shame Diane Arbus is dead.

242
00:19:46,072 --> 00:19:50,112
She could take some fucking
great photographs in here.

243
00:19:52,993 --> 00:19:58,863
- What's the matter with you today?
- Nothing. I just have a lot on my mind.

244
00:19:59,073 --> 00:20:02,623
- I don't wanna bore you with it.
- Thank you.

245
00:20:08,154 --> 00:20:10,111
Come here.

246
00:20:12,075 --> 00:20:14,828
- Why?
- Just do it.

247
00:20:22,516 --> 00:20:24,268
What's wrong?

248
00:20:24,996 --> 00:20:29,627
I'm about to become an undertaker,
and I'm scared to death of it.

249
00:20:29,837 --> 00:20:32,226
A huge corporation wants
to put us out of business...

250
00:20:32,437 --> 00:20:36,510
...and I'm worried my sister's not
only a crackhead, she's an arsonist.

251
00:20:37,477 --> 00:20:42,393
- There's a lot of sadness in this house.
- It's a funeral home.

252
00:20:42,758 --> 00:20:48,435
No wonder you ran away. You channel
other people's pain, you know that?

253
00:20:49,879 --> 00:20:52,313
My father called it a gift.

254
00:20:54,719 --> 00:20:56,914
It is a gift.

255
00:21:35,803 --> 00:21:38,192
Oh, God!

256
00:21:41,044 --> 00:21:44,832
- Oh, God!
- Guess dinner's ready.

257
00:21:46,524 --> 00:21:49,642
So, what's it like to be interrogated?
Did you flash your crotch...

258
00:21:49,845 --> 00:21:52,234
...like Sharon Stone in that movie?
- Claire.

259
00:21:52,445 --> 00:21:56,358
They just keep asking the same
question different ways to trip you up.

260
00:21:56,565 --> 00:21:59,399
That's cool. Was it fun?
I bet it was kind of fun.

261
00:21:59,646 --> 00:22:02,922
- Not really.
- Think they'll wanna interrogate me?

262
00:22:03,446 --> 00:22:05,004
No.

263
00:22:07,486 --> 00:22:10,604
Nate, will you say grace?

264
00:22:13,047 --> 00:22:15,402
- Wouldn't David rather?
- Please.

265
00:22:18,328 --> 00:22:21,206
Thank you, Lord, for our health and
bounty through Christ. Amen.

266
00:22:21,448 --> 00:22:23,325
What, are you on crack?

267
00:22:24,288 --> 00:22:25,277
Squash?

268
00:22:28,249 --> 00:22:30,888
Mom, Nate and I have been
working on a business plan...

269
00:22:31,089 --> 00:22:33,398
...to figure out how we're
gonna fend off Kroehner.

270
00:22:33,609 --> 00:22:38,047
Business plan? Your father
never had a business plan.

271
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:43,608
- Yeah, that's part of the problem.
- We'd like to go over it with you.

272
00:22:43,810 --> 00:22:48,282
I don't need to see it.
It's your business, not mine.

273
00:22:48,851 --> 00:22:51,684
- Is there sauce for the pasta?
- I'll get it.

274
00:22:53,971 --> 00:22:57,008
- Brenda, what do you do for a living?
- She gives massages.

275
00:22:57,211 --> 00:22:59,851
- Shiatsu.
- Now, what exactly is that?

276
00:23:00,052 --> 00:23:02,327
It's a Japanese
bodywork technique...

277
00:23:02,532 --> 00:23:07,128
...that involves pressure to points
on the acupuncture meridians.

278
00:23:07,332 --> 00:23:12,361
Well, how interesting, acupuncture.
That's the pins, right?

279
00:23:12,613 --> 00:23:17,768
- Yes. The pins.
- So you stick pins in people.

280
00:23:18,574 --> 00:23:22,567
I use my thumbs, wrists, elbows.

281
00:23:22,814 --> 00:23:25,965
So you stick your thumbs in people?

282
00:23:26,174 --> 00:23:30,248
No. At least not as part of my job.

283
00:23:37,215 --> 00:23:41,767
- I hope you stay for dessert.
- It's peach cobbler.

284
00:23:44,096 --> 00:23:45,609
Yum.

285
00:23:52,857 --> 00:23:56,896
This is a nice box. That
Federico is a good salesman, huh?

286
00:23:57,097 --> 00:23:59,612
I'll say. You know what the
markup is on one of these?

287
00:23:59,818 --> 00:24:01,854
Thirty-two hundred.

288
00:24:03,898 --> 00:24:07,335
Hey, can I get like a nightlight up
in here? I don't like the dark.

289
00:24:07,539 --> 00:24:11,054
Well, then you shouldn't have gone
and gotten yourself shot.

290
00:24:12,179 --> 00:24:14,135
Shit, that's cold, man.

291
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:21,137
Mr. Powerful and his
entourage are here.

292
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:24,810
- I'll be right there.
- Who were you talking to?

293
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:27,059
Myself.

294
00:24:31,341 --> 00:24:35,619
David, why did you stop
going to church with me?

295
00:24:37,302 --> 00:24:39,975
I've been going to a different church
with a friend of mine.

296
00:24:40,542 --> 00:24:44,137
That cop? The black man?

297
00:24:45,022 --> 00:24:47,332
Don't be a pussy.

298
00:24:48,423 --> 00:24:51,335
Yes, Mom, that cop, the black man.

299
00:25:27,187 --> 00:25:31,783
I love you, Paco. Oh, God.

300
00:25:51,989 --> 00:25:53,707
You all right?

301
00:25:54,909 --> 00:26:00,030
I look like a fucking Bible
salesman. I look like you.

302
00:26:01,470 --> 00:26:04,621
Man, what's up with this
whack-ass music?

303
00:26:09,311 --> 00:26:15,227
- I'm not sure about the music.
- Yeah, it blows.

304
00:26:15,431 --> 00:26:17,309
What about the "Ave Maria"?

305
00:26:17,512 --> 00:26:19,264
- Perfect.
- Perfect.

306
00:26:52,915 --> 00:26:54,348
Honey?

307
00:26:55,675 --> 00:26:58,907
God, no. No, please.

308
00:27:00,556 --> 00:27:02,353
No, no, no.

309
00:27:09,277 --> 00:27:10,710
No!

310
00:27:17,918 --> 00:27:22,355
It's like a mad scientist lab in here.
How can you live here?

311
00:27:22,558 --> 00:27:25,915
Better than a Turkish prison.
Most days.

312
00:27:34,279 --> 00:27:38,034
- Jesus.
- Told you.

313
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:44,879
- Did you ever kill anybody?
- I don't know. Shot at a few.

314
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:48,318
Everybody thinks I burned down
this house across the street.

315
00:27:49,001 --> 00:27:52,277
- Did you?
- What do you think?

316
00:27:57,802 --> 00:28:01,112
What's it like to shoot a gun?

317
00:28:01,682 --> 00:28:03,513
You wanna try some time?

318
00:28:03,722 --> 00:28:09,081
- Come down to East Los, be down.
- Are you serious? Because I will.

319
00:28:10,923 --> 00:28:14,120
You're some kind of
tough, little bitch, huh?

320
00:28:18,884 --> 00:28:22,240
You didn't hear your road dog
calling for help on your machine.

321
00:28:22,444 --> 00:28:24,560
You ain't gonna spend
the rest of your life...

322
00:28:24,764 --> 00:28:28,155
...wondering why you didn't pick up
the phone the first time it rang.

323
00:28:28,365 --> 00:28:30,196
You're hurting me.

324
00:28:31,845 --> 00:28:34,518
You don't know shit, little girl.

325
00:28:37,206 --> 00:28:39,322
Don't waste my time.

326
00:28:44,326 --> 00:28:48,718
This one right here is my first one.
After that, man...

327
00:28:48,927 --> 00:28:53,079
I mean, I got me this one right here
when I got jumped in. Check it out.

328
00:28:53,287 --> 00:28:56,360
- That's very intricate.
- Yeah.

329
00:28:56,568 --> 00:29:00,925
And this one. This one took me
three weeks to heal. Watch out.

330
00:29:02,368 --> 00:29:04,438
That's the shit, huh?

331
00:29:10,249 --> 00:29:13,719
- Can I help you?
- Hi, it's so good to see you again.

332
00:29:13,929 --> 00:29:17,479
- How have you been?
- Fine.

333
00:29:17,690 --> 00:29:22,559
So sad. I read about Manuel's death in
the Times. I had to pay my respects.

334
00:29:22,770 --> 00:29:27,925
Oh, it's heartbreaking. The riots...
I mean, the uprising...

335
00:29:28,131 --> 00:29:31,726
...was supposed to increase the peace
and all we have are more dead children.

336
00:29:31,931 --> 00:29:33,205
Did you know him?

337
00:29:33,411 --> 00:29:36,802
Oh, I feel I know all
these innocent victims.

338
00:29:37,892 --> 00:29:41,680
This is not a good time. If you'd like
to forward a card to the family...

339
00:29:41,892 --> 00:29:45,329
Well, maybe I could just
stay a few minutes.

340
00:29:46,973 --> 00:29:50,807
A card. I'll do that.

341
00:30:06,335 --> 00:30:11,455
You should have seen
my baby, so happy...

342
00:30:11,655 --> 00:30:16,172
...such a smile that could
break your heart.

343
00:30:17,416 --> 00:30:23,764
What kind of God lets a baby like
that get caught up in all that shit?

344
00:30:24,937 --> 00:30:26,450
Drugs.

345
00:30:27,257 --> 00:30:28,815
Guns.

346
00:30:30,257 --> 00:30:31,770
Death.

347
00:30:37,338 --> 00:30:42,537
Mrs. Bolin, I'm not gonna tell you
that it's all gonna be okay.

348
00:30:42,738 --> 00:30:45,207
But it just takes time.

349
00:30:46,419 --> 00:30:48,728
This is as bad as it gets.

350
00:30:49,499 --> 00:30:52,172
I have nothing to live for.

351
00:30:53,259 --> 00:30:57,617
You have your husband.
You have you.

352
00:30:58,860 --> 00:31:02,535
You have the memory of that little
baby. You have to keep that alive.

353
00:31:05,181 --> 00:31:08,014
My father died on Christmas Eve.

354
00:31:09,901 --> 00:31:13,211
And there's so much I never said...

355
00:31:14,862 --> 00:31:17,092
...never knew about him.

356
00:31:18,342 --> 00:31:20,298
But he's a part of me.

357
00:31:22,142 --> 00:31:25,021
And Manny will always
be a part of you.

358
00:31:25,943 --> 00:31:30,698
Why didn't God take me
instead of my boy?

359
00:31:32,423 --> 00:31:34,016
I don't know.

360
00:31:35,184 --> 00:31:41,054
You gotta apologize to your boy Keith.
Otherwise, you're just a born bitch.

361
00:31:41,264 --> 00:31:43,494
You're speaking like
this at your funeral?

362
00:31:43,705 --> 00:31:48,017
Damn straight. I say
whatever I goddamn please.

363
00:31:48,465 --> 00:31:54,382
I've been to a ton of funerals.
You seen one, you seen them all.

364
00:31:54,626 --> 00:31:58,505
- Even mine.
- No gunfire, no fights.

365
00:31:58,706 --> 00:32:03,497
Nah. No Sharks, no Jets.

366
00:32:04,547 --> 00:32:06,777
Just like any other funeral.

367
00:32:09,067 --> 00:32:12,423
- You let down, huh?
- A little.

368
00:32:18,548 --> 00:32:23,703
A Detective McBride just called. They
made a determination of the house fire.

369
00:32:24,069 --> 00:32:27,982
- They termed it "cause unknown. "
- So they ruled out arson.

370
00:32:28,189 --> 00:32:32,740
No, they just can't tell.
Either way, the case is closed.

371
00:32:32,949 --> 00:32:35,942
Which doesn't rule out the possibility
that Claire set that fire.

372
00:32:36,150 --> 00:32:37,424
She didn't do that, Nate.

373
00:32:37,670 --> 00:32:41,345
Well, what if she did, Mom? Pretending
it didn't happen is not gonna help.

374
00:32:46,671 --> 00:32:51,699
I'm sorry about last night
with Brenda...

375
00:32:53,112 --> 00:32:56,343
...when you walked in on us.
- I know what you're talking about.

376
00:32:58,432 --> 00:33:01,868
- Where have you been?
- None of your business.

377
00:33:02,072 --> 00:33:04,633
When did this become a police state?

378
00:33:08,953 --> 00:33:11,387
I need an Altoid.

379
00:33:19,154 --> 00:33:24,070
The original sin
wasn't eating the apple.

380
00:33:24,315 --> 00:33:27,432
It wasn't questioning authority.

381
00:33:27,675 --> 00:33:33,228
It was not giving God the chance
to give his side of the argument.

382
00:33:33,436 --> 00:33:37,827
It was just taking the
serpent's word as gospel.

383
00:33:38,076 --> 00:33:42,946
It was not going back to God
and saying, "Hey, what gives?

384
00:33:43,197 --> 00:33:46,473
He said you are lying to us. "

385
00:33:47,277 --> 00:33:51,907
It was just assuming that God lies.

386
00:33:55,398 --> 00:33:57,673
I'm sorry about the other day.

387
00:34:00,118 --> 00:34:02,679
Aren't you gonna say,
"Hey, man, I'm sorry too...

388
00:34:02,879 --> 00:34:07,191
...for revealing my dormant psycho
side and scaring the shit out of you"?

389
00:34:10,319 --> 00:34:12,230
You really think I hate myself?

390
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:15,512
- Good to see you, David.
- Hi.

391
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:26,670
I know where you are. I was there.
I'll wait for you because I love you.

392
00:34:27,081 --> 00:34:29,311
But I'm not moving
backwards for anybody.

393
00:34:29,521 --> 00:34:33,515
I'm not asking you to move backwards.
I'm just asking you to be patient...

394
00:34:33,722 --> 00:34:35,553
...and a little calmer.

395
00:34:35,762 --> 00:34:38,913
Do you have any idea what I put up
with on my job every day?

396
00:34:39,162 --> 00:34:42,235
How many times the word "fag"
has been written on my locker?

397
00:34:42,483 --> 00:34:46,920
How many times I wonder going into a
dangerous situation if I'll get back up?

398
00:34:47,163 --> 00:34:49,279
We were stepped on
yesterday, David.

399
00:34:49,523 --> 00:34:52,914
And I did something about it
because I am tired of it.

400
00:34:53,124 --> 00:34:57,003
When you get tired of it,
you let me know.

401
00:35:04,765 --> 00:35:08,201
- Morning.
- Hi.

402
00:35:11,525 --> 00:35:14,882
You think I should make a peace
offering to your mother?

403
00:35:15,086 --> 00:35:17,395
No, that'll just make things worse.

404
00:35:17,606 --> 00:35:20,200
I brought it up yesterday.
She nearly bit my head off.

405
00:35:20,406 --> 00:35:25,401
Oh, Jesus. It's no accident you
guys are undertakers...

406
00:35:25,607 --> 00:35:29,600
...because you take every fucking feeling
you have, put it in a box and bury it.

407
00:35:29,807 --> 00:35:34,438
Better that than examine every fucking
moment until the joy is drained out of it.

408
00:35:48,529 --> 00:35:50,406
- Come here.
- No.

409
00:35:50,649 --> 00:35:52,561
Just do it.

410
00:35:53,770 --> 00:35:57,285
Sex does not solve everything, Nate.

411
00:35:57,770 --> 00:35:59,726
You wouldn't have to
worry about us...

412
00:35:59,930 --> 00:36:02,365
...while you're working
and we're out of school,

413
00:36:02,611 --> 00:36:06,001
Right, The family that plays
together, stays together,

414
00:36:06,211 --> 00:36:10,841
And it'd be a groovy way to find out
exactly what's wrong with this country,

415
00:36:11,091 --> 00:36:13,652
I'd be able to see all
the injustices firsthand,

416
00:36:13,852 --> 00:36:16,241
Look, kids, everything
you say makes sense...

417
00:36:16,452 --> 00:36:19,364
...and it would be marvelous
if we could go, But there's one...

418
00:36:19,572 --> 00:36:22,690
Claire, are you okay?

419
00:36:27,893 --> 00:36:32,092
- No.
- Well, do you wanna talk about it?

420
00:36:33,814 --> 00:36:35,293
Sure.

421
00:36:36,094 --> 00:36:39,643
My pimp's threatening to beat me up
because I can't turn enough tricks.

422
00:36:39,854 --> 00:36:45,134
What's worse is, he's threatening to
take away my smack. It's hell.

423
00:36:49,495 --> 00:36:54,695
- Why do you have to be such a bitch?
- Why do you assume I'm in trouble?

424
00:36:54,896 --> 00:36:59,208
Like you guys are such
shining examples. Jesus.

425
00:37:00,456 --> 00:37:04,416
She's right, Mom, Do you want
Chris to pump gas all his life?

426
00:37:04,617 --> 00:37:07,973
And Tracy to wait on tables
in some sleazy strip joint?

427
00:37:08,417 --> 00:37:11,410
Kroehner is going to keep
strong-arming our suppliers...

428
00:37:11,618 --> 00:37:13,973
...undercutting us, stealing funerals.

429
00:37:14,218 --> 00:37:18,734
We're never gonna be able to compete
in terms of size or market presence.

430
00:37:18,938 --> 00:37:23,012
Where we can compete
is quality of service, integrity.

431
00:37:23,259 --> 00:37:27,935
- We'll give them the human touch.
- It all sounds good to me.

432
00:37:28,139 --> 00:37:29,857
Is this over?

433
00:37:30,059 --> 00:37:33,735
But we have to get our message out.
We'll need to market and promote.

434
00:37:33,940 --> 00:37:37,171
Replace outmoded equipment
and install computers.

435
00:37:37,780 --> 00:37:39,611
Fine.

436
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:46,249
In order to make this all work, we'll
need a significant financial investment.

437
00:37:47,021 --> 00:37:49,137
- How much?
- Ninety-three thousand.

438
00:37:51,662 --> 00:37:55,132
You want me to give you $93,000
from your father's life insurance?

439
00:37:55,382 --> 00:37:56,781
Nobody else is going to do it.

440
00:37:56,982 --> 00:37:59,701
We're still paying off a bank
note Dad took out years ago.

441
00:37:59,942 --> 00:38:03,731
We hate to ask, Mom,
but we're desperate.

442
00:38:05,343 --> 00:38:08,574
- Of course, you're not obligated.
- I know that.

443
00:38:10,824 --> 00:38:12,701
When do you need it?

444
00:38:14,784 --> 00:38:18,572
- You sure, Mom?
- But it's not a loan.

445
00:38:19,304 --> 00:38:22,775
I'm now an investor
in Fisher & Sons.

446
00:38:23,945 --> 00:38:28,621
We'll establish a fair percentage
of equity and rate of return.

447
00:38:29,025 --> 00:38:33,144
I can invest in either
my boys or tech stocks.

448
00:38:33,346 --> 00:38:36,258
Anything's better than the track.

449
00:38:39,626 --> 00:38:44,621
David, I'd like it if you'd come with
me to church every once in a while...

450
00:38:44,827 --> 00:38:49,457
...now that your father's gone.
I shouldn't have to go alone.

451
00:38:50,067 --> 00:38:51,581
Okay.

452
00:38:57,948 --> 00:39:00,224
Well, that was weird.

453
00:39:00,789 --> 00:39:03,747
It gets weirder. There was a message
on my machine from Gilardi.

454
00:39:03,949 --> 00:39:06,861
He wants to meet with us today.

455
00:39:10,190 --> 00:39:14,388
Hey, dog. Getting ready
to throw some blows?

456
00:39:15,910 --> 00:39:19,983
If you were me, Paco, what would you
say to Gilardi? What would you do?

457
00:39:20,191 --> 00:39:21,670
If I was you?

458
00:39:22,391 --> 00:39:25,781
Shit, if I was you, I wouldn't
own a fucking funeral home.

459
00:39:26,111 --> 00:39:27,829
But all right.

460
00:39:28,751 --> 00:39:34,145
All right, say I'm doing my thing,
selling my shit.

461
00:39:34,352 --> 00:39:38,504
Some punk ass tries to
clock me from my corner.

462
00:39:39,312 --> 00:39:41,065
You know what I say?

463
00:39:43,753 --> 00:39:49,191
I say, "Peep this, motherfucker! 5:00,
you near me, my corner or my shit...

464
00:39:49,393 --> 00:39:52,704
...I'll cut your fucking stomach,
watch your guts spill out.

465
00:39:52,914 --> 00:39:56,793
I'll let you live until
you slowly bleed to death...

466
00:39:56,994 --> 00:39:59,873
...in front of your fucking kids. "

467
00:40:06,635 --> 00:40:08,273
Feel your heart racing?

468
00:40:10,916 --> 00:40:15,546
Because when the other guy
feels like that, you won.

469
00:40:16,996 --> 00:40:18,748
Come on, David.

470
00:40:18,956 --> 00:40:22,188
You gotta stand up, man.
You gotta step up.

471
00:40:22,717 --> 00:40:24,992
Yeah, you stepped up.
Look what happened to you.

472
00:40:25,237 --> 00:40:30,596
That's right. For 20 years,
I lived my life like a man.

473
00:40:31,718 --> 00:40:34,027
When are you gonna start?

474
00:40:39,959 --> 00:40:45,079
- You lowered your offer.
- What can I say? The market fluctuates.

475
00:40:45,279 --> 00:40:49,192
Thanks, but we don't see a need to
align ourselves with Kroehner right now.

476
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:52,358
Okay.

477
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:55,517
I'll make it simple.

478
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:58,310
You accept our offer
by the end of the day...

479
00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:01,957
...or I'll make it my personal mission
to bury you by the end of the month.

480
00:41:02,161 --> 00:41:05,358
David, you in on
this suicide mission?

481
00:41:09,121 --> 00:41:10,555
David?

482
00:41:12,602 --> 00:41:15,753
- You just threatened my family.
- Let's not be melodramatic.

483
00:41:16,002 --> 00:41:19,313
What do you expect us
to do, run and hide?

484
00:41:19,523 --> 00:41:22,993
- Sell and be grateful? Pack up and move?
- Lf you're smart.

485
00:41:25,163 --> 00:41:29,794
You have the Kroehner organization
behind you. And what do we have?

486
00:41:31,564 --> 00:41:33,043
You.

487
00:41:34,044 --> 00:41:36,319
One day when your mind isn't
on Fisher & Sons...

488
00:41:36,524 --> 00:41:39,562
...I will find you
or someone you love.

489
00:41:42,365 --> 00:41:45,038
I'm not saying anyone
is going to die.

490
00:41:45,245 --> 00:41:47,281
There are tragedies
far worse than death.

491
00:41:47,485 --> 00:41:53,163
Things you couldn't even dream of, you
spineless, candy-ass, corporate fuck.

492
00:41:53,406 --> 00:41:55,601
Just give me a reason.

493
00:42:02,047 --> 00:42:06,199
It's your decision. Are we really
worth the trouble, Mr. Gilardi?

494
00:42:09,528 --> 00:42:12,361
Lunch is over. Get lost.

495
00:42:14,528 --> 00:42:16,519
Are you deaf?

496
00:42:25,249 --> 00:42:28,446
- What the fuck was that?
- I think I'm gonna throw up.

497
00:42:32,130 --> 00:42:33,882
Hi.

498
00:42:36,010 --> 00:42:41,085
I hope you like fancy bath stuff. I went
a little crazy at the Beverly Center.

499
00:42:41,931 --> 00:42:46,925
- Thank you. This wasn't necessary.
- Yes, it was.

500
00:42:47,171 --> 00:42:51,370
I'm afraid you might not have seen
me in my best light the other night.

501
00:42:51,572 --> 00:42:54,291
I saw more of you than I cared to.

502
00:42:55,212 --> 00:42:56,964
Okay.

503
00:42:57,772 --> 00:43:02,324
Look. I'm not a very
traditional person.

504
00:43:03,613 --> 00:43:09,530
And I don't really know what's
happening between me and Nate...

505
00:43:09,734 --> 00:43:15,525
...but every once in a while
I get a glimpse...

506
00:43:15,734 --> 00:43:19,853
...of things maybe working
out for us...

507
00:43:21,335 --> 00:43:25,089
...and I'm really sorry
about what happened.

508
00:43:29,576 --> 00:43:31,806
Be careful with him.

509
00:43:32,576 --> 00:43:35,966
He's a lot more fragile
than he'd like to think.

510
00:43:36,496 --> 00:43:38,453
Aren't we all?

511
00:43:40,137 --> 00:43:45,530
- Well, thank you.
- My pleasure.

512
00:43:57,258 --> 00:43:59,295
Are the Fishers around?

513
00:43:59,539 --> 00:44:02,372
- You need David?
- All of them and you too.

514
00:44:02,579 --> 00:44:04,331
Just tell me what
you're unhappy with.

515
00:44:04,539 --> 00:44:06,530
Just get them, all right?

516
00:44:18,341 --> 00:44:20,411
Will you join us?

517
00:44:36,942 --> 00:44:39,741
Merciful Jesus...

518
00:44:39,943 --> 00:44:46,018
...please bring rest and peace
to our fallen brother...

519
00:44:46,223 --> 00:44:47,657
...son...

520
00:44:49,544 --> 00:44:51,421
...friend...

521
00:44:52,064 --> 00:44:55,181
...Manuel Paco Bolin.

522
00:44:57,344 --> 00:45:02,021
May he live with you
forever in your lightened truth.

523
00:45:02,585 --> 00:45:07,614
- Almighty Father. Amen.
- Amen.

524
00:45:10,426 --> 00:45:14,704
We also wanna thank the Fishers...

525
00:45:16,546 --> 00:45:20,176
...who lost a father and husband.

526
00:45:21,347 --> 00:45:24,817
Lord bring peace to
them in their grief...

527
00:45:26,707 --> 00:45:28,938
...as you have in ours.

528
00:45:34,948 --> 00:45:36,506
We'll miss you.

529
00:45:55,790 --> 00:46:01,229
Hey, let go of me, you
fucking fag. I gots to go.

530
00:46:01,791 --> 00:46:04,544
Jesus, you're just a kid.

531
00:46:06,151 --> 00:46:07,983
So are you.

532
00:46:23,713 --> 00:46:25,510
Hey, David.

533
00:46:26,674 --> 00:46:28,904
Don't be a bitch.

534
00:46:44,795 --> 00:46:47,151
Shit. Now, I know why you
wanted to go bowling...

535
00:46:47,356 --> 00:46:49,586
...instead of a movie.
- I was state champion...

536
00:46:49,796 --> 00:46:52,515
...in the Youth For Christ Bowling
League when I was 17.

537
00:46:52,716 --> 00:46:57,074
- You're gonna beat the pants off me.
- That's my intent.

538
00:46:57,797 --> 00:47:01,073
I got a college degree, and I still
cannot figure how this scoring works.

539
00:47:01,277 --> 00:47:03,996
Hey, you fellows together?

540
00:47:05,517 --> 00:47:07,952
Yeah, we are.

541
00:47:08,998 --> 00:47:10,351
That's cool.

542
00:47:19,199 --> 00:47:21,952
Hey, Bren, the door's unlocked.

543
00:47:23,919 --> 00:47:27,708
- Brenda?
- In the bedroom.

544
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:32,276
I'm just here to deliver a pizza,
ma'am. I don't want any trouble.

545
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:35,517
I got your tip right here.

546
00:47:36,481 --> 00:47:37,880
Whoa.

547
00:47:40,161 --> 00:47:42,277
Where's my pizza?

548
00:47:49,642 --> 00:47:55,991
Mom asked me to tell you that the
lavender bath scrub was delicious.

549
00:47:56,763 --> 00:47:59,436
She's not supposed to eat it.

550
00:48:01,563 --> 00:48:06,274
- What's with all the candles?
- I'm burning up.

551
00:48:06,764 --> 00:48:10,757
Burning up for your love.

552
00:48:20,405 --> 00:48:21,804
What?

553
00:48:26,766 --> 00:48:28,040
What?

554
00:48:28,766 --> 00:48:31,678
You like some guy enough to have
his name burned in your flesh.

555
00:48:31,926 --> 00:48:34,042
I would have done a lot
more than that for him.

556
00:48:36,967 --> 00:48:43,315
- What's up with you?
- I had a really weird day.

557
00:48:47,968 --> 00:48:50,198
Poor baby.

558
00:49:29,652 --> 00:49:33,361
- Mom, are you okay?
- Fine.

559
00:49:35,333 --> 00:49:41,090
Can I ask you something? And
you promise to tell me the truth?

560
00:49:41,453 --> 00:49:42,966
Maybe.

561
00:49:43,893 --> 00:49:47,091
- Did you set that fire?
- No.

562
00:49:47,934 --> 00:49:51,131
No, I would never
do anything like that.

563
00:49:53,014 --> 00:49:55,449
I may have swiped that foot, though.

564
00:49:59,975 --> 00:50:02,091
Dinner's almost ready.

565
00:50:21,103 --> 00:50:26,058
